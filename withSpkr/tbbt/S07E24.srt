<1-1,Leonard>你妈还好吗
<1-1,Leonard>How's your mom holding up?

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,780
<1-2,Howard>她还行  但我们又失去个看护了
<1-2,Howard>She's doing okay, but we just lost another nurse.

3
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,450
<1-3,Amy>-这是第几个了  -第二个
<1-3,Amy>- How many is that now? - Two,

4
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:11,830
<1-4,Howard>我知道你在想什么
<1-4,Howard>and I know what you're thinking--

5
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:13,490
<1-4,Howard>她们是被她吃掉的
<1-4,Howard>she's eating them.

6
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,270
<1-5,Bernadette>她太难伺候  看护都不想伺候了
<1-5,Bernadette>She's just so impossible, they keep quitting.

7
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:19,780
<1-6,Sheldon>那现在是谁在照看她
<1-6,Sheldon>So, who's watching her now?

8
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:23,040
<1-7,Howard>一碗掺了几颗安眠药的巧克力豆
<1-7,Howard>A bowl full of M & M's with a few Ambien tossed in.

<1-10,Leonard>Penny and I have some big news.

14
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:34,070
<1-10,Leonard>我们订婚了
<1-10,Leonard>We're engaged!

15
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:35,070
<1-10,Leonard>天啊
<1-10,Leonard>Oh my God!

16
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:42,870
<1-11,Raj>我还以为我跟艾米丽上床了会是最大新闻呢
<1-11,Raj>And I thought me having sex with Emily was gonna be the big news.

17
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,240
<1-12,Leonard>不带你们这样的
<1-12,Leonard>What the hell!

18
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:53,620
<1-13,Bernadette>你们整天求婚来求婚去
<1-13,Bernadette>You guys propose all the time.

19
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,420
<1-13,Bernadette>而这是千年头一遭
<1-13,Bernadette>This never happens.

<2-1,Raj>天啊  我今天超饿
<2-1,Raj>Boy, I'm so hungry today.

33
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,820
<2-1,Raj>你们说是为什么呢
<2-1,Raj>I wonder why?

34
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:34,910
<2-2,Howard>因为做爱消耗太多体力吗
<2-2,Howard>Because you had sex the other night?

35
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:36,700
<2-2,Howard>其实呢
<2-2,Howard>You know what?

36
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,730
<2-3,Raj>可能真是这原因哦
<2-3,Raj>That may be it.

37
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:42,530
<2-3,Raj>对了  这事没骑车这么简单
<2-3,Raj>By the way, it isn't like riding a bike.

38
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:44,900
<2-3,Raj>我摔了好几次呢
<2-3,Raj>Like, I fell off a few times.

39
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,580
<2-4,Leonard>兄弟
<2-4,Leonard>Hey, buddy.

40
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:49,960
<2-5,Sheldon>你好
<2-5,Sheldon>Hello.

41
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,570
<2-6,Leonard>你没事吧
<2-6,Leonard>You okay?

42
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,730
<2-7,Sheldon>我刚被叫进塞伯特校长的办公室
<2-7,Sheldon>I just got called into President Siebert's office.

43
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:57,340
<2-7,Sheldon>学校不准我
<2-7,Sheldon>The university won't let me

44
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:00,830
<2-7,Sheldon>把研究方向改为宇宙暴胀论
<2-7,Sheldon>switch my field of study to inflationary cosmology.

45
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:03,820
<2-7,Sheldon>他们逼我继续研究弦理论
<2-7,Sheldon>They're forcing me to continue with string theory.

46
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:04,870
<2-8,Howard>为什么
<2-8,Howard>Why?

47
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,730
<2-9,Sheldon>他说大学雇我是让我研究弦理论
<2-9,Sheldon>He said it's why they hired me,

48
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:09,090
<2-9,Sheldon>我的研究经费也仅限于研究弦理论
<2-9,Sheldon>it's-it's what my grant was designated for,

49
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,500
<2-9,Sheldon>而且每个人都有人在江湖身不由己的时候
<2-9,Sheldon>and that everybody has to do things they don't want to do.

50
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,440
<2-9,Sheldon>他还举了一个他身不由己的例子
<2-9,Sheldon>He then gave an example of something he had to do,

51
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,450
<2-9,Sheldon>就是虽然他十分不想
<2-9,Sheldon>even though he didn't want to,

52
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:18,010
<2-9,Sheldon>却还是不得不见我这傻逼
<2-9,Sheldon>which was look at my stupid face.

53
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,770
<2-10,Leonard>他怎么能把这话
<2-10,Leonard>That's a rude thing to say.

54
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:23,710
<2-10,Leonard>说出口呢
<2-10,Leonard>Out loud.

55
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,630
<2-11,Sheldon>这太过分了
<2-11,Sheldon>It's an outrage.

56
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:29,890
<2-11,Sheldon>老实说  我现在很想辞职走人
<2-11,Sheldon>Honestly, I'm tempted to leave the university.

57
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:31,510
<2-12,Howard>如果你是认真在考虑这事
<2-12,Howard>You know, if you're really serious about that,

58
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:34,090
<2-12,Howard>我听说在肥胖老人家庭看护领域
<2-12,Howard>I hear there are some exciting opportunities

59
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:36,840
<2-12,Howard>有些很不错的机会哦
<2-12,Howard>in home care for the old and fat.

60
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,820
<2-13,Leonard>无论你想做什么  千万不要贸然行事
<2-13,Leonard>Whatever you do, just don't make any rash decisions.

61
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:41,880
<2-13,Leonard>我不知道
<2-13,Leonard>I don't know.

62
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,040
<2-14,Sheldon>我现在超级不爽
<2-14,Sheldon>I am really aggravated.

63
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,390
<2-15,Raj>我心情低落的时候  我就跟妹子上床
<2-15,Raj>When I'm feeling low, I have sex with a girl.

64
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,870
<2-15,Raj>但这纯属个人喜好啦
<2-15,Raj>But that's just me.

65
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,730
<3-1,Howard>-别走嘛  再给她次机会  -不要
<3-1,Howard>- Oh, come on, give her a chance. - No.

66
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,890
<3-2,Nurse>人生苦短  我得及时行乐
<3-2,Nurse>Life, it is too short.

67
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,300
<3-3,Bernadette>我知道你才来做了一天半
<3-3,Bernadette>I know you've only been here a day and a half,

68
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,570
<3-3,Bernadette>但你就像我们的家人一样呢
<3-3,Bernadette>but you're like part of the family!

69
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:09,630
<3-3,Bernadette>我觉得看护中介不会再介绍人来了
<3-3,Bernadette>I don't think the service is gonna send any more people.

70
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:15,320
<3-4,Howard>看来我们只能把妈放回大海里了[鲸鱼]
<3-4,Howard>Yeah, maybe it's time we just release Ma back into the sea.

71
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,230
<3-5,Bernadette>开玩笑有什么用
<3-5,Bernadette>That's not helpful.

72
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:21,370
<3-6,Howard>那我们只能学着接受
<3-6,Howard>Well, then, we may need to get used to the idea

73
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:25,040
<3-6,Howard>接下来几个月得在这住的事实了
<3-6,Howard>that we're gonna be living here the next few months.

74
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,010
<3-7,Bernadette>但我们都有工作
<3-7,Bernadette>But we have jobs.

75
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:28,490
<3-7,Bernadette>哪有空一天到晚在这照顾她
<3-7,Bernadette>We can't baby-sit her 24 hours a day.

76
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:31,400
<3-8,Howard>我们把年假休掉啊
<3-8,Howard>Well, what if we use our vacation time?

77
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,960
<3-9,Bernadette>我的假期想留给夏威夷  不是地狱
<3-9,Bernadette>I wanted to go to Hawaii, not Hell.

78
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,400
<3-10,Howard>那我真是没招了
<3-10,Howard>I don't know what else we can do.

79
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:40,540
<3-11,Bernadette>华仔  我爱你
<3-11,Bernadette>Howie, I love you,

80
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,740
<3-11,Bernadette>作为你的妻子  你妈妈的问题
<3-11,Bernadette>and as your wife, your mother is every bit

81
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:46,020
<3-11,Bernadette>我责无旁贷  所以...
<3-11,Bernadette>as much my problem as she is yours, so...

82
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,090
<3-11,Bernadette>我想离婚
<3-11,Bernadette>I want a divorce.

83
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:54,250
<4-1,Mrs Hofstadter (on webcam)>你好吗  莱纳德
<4-1,Mrs Hofstadter (on webcam)>Hello, Leonard.

84
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,560
<4-2,Leonard>你好啊  老妈
<4-2,Leonard>Hi, Mom.

85
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,900
<4-2,Leonard>我有件好消息要宣布
<4-2,Leonard>I have some exciting news.

86
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,950
<4-3,Mrs Hofstadter>我听着呢
<4-3,Mrs Hofstadter>I'm listening.

87
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:02,110
<4-4,Leonard>在我说之前
<4-4,Leonard>Before I tell you,

88
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:04,450
<4-4,Leonard>你能答应会尽量为我开心
<4-4,Leonard>will you promise to try and be happy for me

89
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:07,550
<4-4,Leonard>并把心中的疑虑都留在心里就好吗
<4-4,Leonard>and keep any concerns you have to yourself?

90
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,240
<4-4,Leonard>不行
<4-4,Leonard>No.

91
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:14,860
<4-5,Mrs Hofstadter>我就替你省了这支支吾吾的功夫吧
<4-5,Mrs Hofstadter>Let me save you all of your hemming and hawing.

92
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:18,410
<4-5,Mrs Hofstadter>谢尔顿告诉我你跟佩妮订婚了
<4-5,Mrs Hofstadter>Sheldon already told me that you and Penny are engaged.

93
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:22,400
<4-6,Leonard>我不喜欢你跟他聊比跟我聊还多
<4-6,Leonard>I-I hate that you talk to him more than you talk to me.

94
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,390
<4-7,Mrs Hofstadter>那你想我跟你多聊天吗
<4-7,Mrs Hofstadter>Would you like for you and me to talk more?

95
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,090
<4-8,Leonard>其实也还好啦
<4-8,Leonard>You know what? It's probably fine.

96
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:33,800
<4-9,Mrs Hofstadter>无论如何  虽然我曾有过疑虑
<4-9,Mrs Hofstadter>In any event, while I've had my misgivings about...

97
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:35,770
<4-9,Mrs Hofstadter>对佩妮这货
<4-9,Mrs Hofstadter>Penny...

98
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,030
<4-9,Mrs Hofstadter>但谢尔顿说了很多她的好话
<4-9,Mrs Hofstadter>...Sheldon spoke very fondly of her,

99
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:41,020
<4-9,Mrs Hofstadter>所以如果谢尔顿觉得她够好
<4-9,Mrs Hofstadter>and if she is good enough for him,

100
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,820
<4-10,Leonard>那我也会觉得她够好
<4-10,Leonard>then she's good enough for me.

101
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:47,170
<4-10,Leonard>我是你儿子呢
<4-10,Leonard>I'm your son.

102
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:50,470
<4-10,Leonard>那我觉得她够好就不算数吗
<4-10,Leonard>What about the fact that she's good enough for me?

103
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,900
<4-11,Mrs Hofstadter>算吧
<4-11,Mrs Hofstadter>Sure.

104

<4-12,Leonard>谢谢你啊  老妈

<4-13,Mrs Hofstadter>Leonard, would it make you feel better to hear that

<4-13,Mrs Hofstadter>人生选择  你会比较开心吗
<4-13,Mrs Hofstadter>your mother approved of your life choices?

127
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:56,840
<5-6,Bernadette>你嫁的不光是他这个人
<5-6,Bernadette>You're not just marrying him,

128
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,200
<5-6,Bernadette>还有他的家庭
<5-6,Bernadette>you're marrying his family.

129
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,190
<5-7,Penny>我觉得莱纳德的妈妈对我没意见
<5-7,Penny>I think Leonard's mom's okay with me.

130
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,490
<5-8,Bernadette>有没有意见倒是无所谓
<5-8,Bernadette>It doesn't matter if she's okay with you.

131
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:04,720
<5-8,Bernadette>重点是  她能不能自己上厕所
<5-8,Bernadette>The question is: Can she go to the bathroom by herself?

132
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,250
<5-8,Bernadette>再来一杯
<5-8,Bernadette>Hit me again.

133
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,100
<5-9,Amy>那你们打算在哪儿住
<5-9,Amy>So, what are the living arrangements gonna be?

134
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,820
<5-10,Penny>我们还没谈到这个问题
<5-10,Penny>Well, haven't really talked about it yet,

135
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,070
<5-10,Penny>但我猜到最后
<5-10,Penny>but I figure, at some point,

136
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:21,250
<5-10,Penny>不是我搬去跟他住  就是他搬来跟我住
<5-10,Penny>I'll move in with him, or he'll move in with me.

137
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,870
<5-11,Amy>你现在没工作  住在一起的确比较省钱
<5-11,Amy>Well, with you not working, that makes financial sense.

138
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,020
<5-11,Amy>你现在没工作
<5-11,Amy>You're not working!

139
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,650
<5-12,Bernadette>你有没有兴趣做家庭看护啊
<5-12,Bernadette>How would you like a job in home health care?

140
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,810
<5-13,Penny>门儿都没有
<5-13,Penny>Not a chance.

141
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:31,440
<5-14,Bernadette>-拜托了  我都要绝望了  -不要
<5-14,Bernadette>- Please. I'm desperate. - No.

142
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,090
<5-16,Bernadette>-薪水你说了算  -那好吧
<5-16,Bernadette>- I'll pay you anything you want. - Okay, then, yeah.

143
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:38,130
<6-1,Penny>我不干了  钱你留着请别人吧
<6-1,Penny>No! Keep your money!

144
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:45,190
<6-2,Bernadette>老娘骑电动牛的时间都比这个长
<6-2,Bernadette>I could've ridden a bull longer than that.

145
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:45,190
<6-2,Bernadette>酒吧里仿牛仔驯牛的游戏机器
<6-2,Bernadette>人们骑上去挑战不被摔下来  持续时间久可赢得奖品

146
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,400
<6-2,Bernadette>你在忙什么呢
<6-2,Bernadette>What you working on?

147
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,630
<7-1,Leonard>我向教授评议会提出上诉
<7-1,Leonard>I'm writing an appeal to the Faculty Senate,

148
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:54,920
<7-2,Sheldon>要求不再研究弦理论  转而研究其他方向
<7-2,Sheldon>so that I can move on from string theory.

149
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,390
<7-3,Leonard>写得怎么样了
<7-3,Leonard>Oh. How's it going?

150
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,720
<7-4,Sheldon>给点意见呗
<7-4,Sheldon>You tell me.

151
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:01,680
<7-4,Sheldon>"各位尊敬的同事们
<7-4,Sheldon>"Dear Esteemed Colleagues,

152
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,970
<7-4,Sheldon>或许你们有所耳闻  我要求更改我的研究领域
<7-4,Sheldon>as you may know, I have requested to change my field of study.

153
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:07,020
<7-4,Sheldon>我之所以作此决定  是因为我相信
<7-4,Sheldon>My decision to do so is, I believe,

154
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,000
<7-4,Sheldon>这样做对科学界是最好的
<7-4,Sheldon>in the best interest of science.

155
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,580
<7-4,Sheldon>如你们有时间  我非常乐意用你们听得懂的词语
<7-4,Sheldon>At your convenience, I'd be happy to explain it to you

156
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,780
<7-4,Sheldon>好好解释一番"
<7-4,Sheldon>in words you'll understand."

157
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:18,910
<7-5,Leonard>你在称呼前加个"尊敬的"  还算有礼貌
<7-5,Leonard>It's nice that you called them "Esteemed."

158
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:21,380
<7-6,Sheldon>你说得对  我应该删掉它
<7-6,Sheldon>You're right. I'll take that out.

159
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:26,680
<7-7,Leonard>对了  有件事我想跟你说一下
<7-7,Leonard>So, listen, there was something I was hoping to float past you.

160
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,610
<7-9,Leonard>因为我和佩妮订婚了
<7-9,Leonard>Now that Penny and I are engaged,

161
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:31,280
<7-9,Leonard>我想我们可能需要讨论一下住的问题
<7-9,Leonard>I thought we might want to talk about our living arrangements.

162
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:33,190
<7-9,Leonard>当然
<7-9,Leonard>Of course.

163
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:34,990
<7-10,Sheldon>她总是在这里过夜
<7-10,Sheldon>She's spent many nights here,

164
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:37,560
<7-10,Sheldon>所以你担心在婚礼之前
<7-10,Sheldon>and you're worried about preserving

165
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,470
<7-10,Sheldon>没办法对她的童贞问题进行保密吗
<7-10,Sheldon>the myth of her virginity before the wedding.

166
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:44,370
<7-11,Leonard>不是啦
<7-11,Leonard>I'm not.

167
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:46,200
<7-12,Sheldon>那就好  因为她的童贞船早已远航
<7-12,Sheldon>Good, because not only has that ship sailed,

168
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,710
<7-12,Sheldon>而且如果撞到冰山  肯定会死一大片男人
<7-12,Sheldon>if it hit an iceberg, countless men would perish.

169
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:54,230
<7-13,Leonard>其实我想跟你讨论的是  我和她的住宿问题
<7-13,Leonard>Actually, this is about where she and I are going to live.

170
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:55,720
<7-14,Sheldon>什么意思
<7-14,Sheldon>What do you mean?

171
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,420
<7-15,Leonard>那个...我们俩可能想住在一起
<7-15,Leonard>Well... well, we might want to live together.

172
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:01,860
<7-16,Sheldon>是吗  我早就考虑过这个问题了
<7-16,Sheldon>Oh, yeah, well, I've already given this some thought,

173
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:02,650
<7-16,Sheldon>我呢
<7-16,Sheldon>and...

174
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:05,910
<7-16,Sheldon>也很乐意让佩妮跟我们一起住
<7-16,Sheldon>I'm willing to let Penny live with us

175
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:09,640
<7-16,Sheldon>考察期时每周可以住一天哦
<7-16,Sheldon>one day a week for a trial period.

176
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:13,680
<7-16,Sheldon>当然她子宫内膜脱落
<7-16,Sheldon>Now, obviously, not when she's made cranky

177
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,250
<7-16,Sheldon>脾气暴躁的那几天不能来这住
<7-16,Sheldon>by the shedding of her uterine lining.

178
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,270
<7-17,Leonard>你考虑得真周全
<7-17,Leonard>That's very sweet.

179
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:25,910
<7-17,Leonard>但我们更多考虑的是  我们俩住在一起
<7-17,Leonard>But we were thinking more of us maybe living together with...

180
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:28,360
<7-17,Leonard>没你
<7-17,Leonard>not you.

181
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,840
<7-18,Sheldon>我不懂
<7-18,Sheldon>I don't understand.

182
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:37,670
<7-18,Sheldon>如果没我  我们怎么能都住在一起呢
<7-18,Sheldon>How could we all live together if I'm not there?

183
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,350
<7-19,Leonard>听着  我知道这是一种改变
<7-19,Leonard>Look, I-I know this is... this is change,

184
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:42,620
<7-19,Leonard>听起来很可怕  但是
<7-19,Leonard>and that sounds scary, but...

185
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,280
<7-20,Sheldon>那你要去哪里住
<7-20,Sheldon>Where are you going to go?

186
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,810
<7-20,Sheldon>我不知道
<7-20,Sheldon>I don't know.

187
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:47,660
<7-21,Leonard>我们才开始考虑这个问题
<7-21,Leonard>We just started to think about this.

188
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,450
<7-21,Leonard>或许我会搬去跟佩妮住
<7-21,Leonard>Maybe I'll move in with Penny,

189
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:51,100
<7-21,Leonard>又或许她会搬进来跟我住
<7-21,Leonard>or maybe she and I'll take this place,

190
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,480
<7-22,Sheldon>而你搬到对面住
<7-22,Sheldon>and you can move across the hall.

191
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,860
<7-22,Sheldon>搬到对面住
<7-22,Sheldon>Move across the hall?!

192
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:57,990
<7-22,Sheldon>你抽大麻了吗
<7-22,Sheldon>Did you take a marijuana?!

193
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,550
<7-23,Leonard>没有
<7-23,Leonard>No, I did not.

194
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:05,200
<7-24,Sheldon>那你是脑子被椰子砸了吗
<7-24,Sheldon>Did you get hit on the head with a coconut?

195
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,360
<7-26,Sheldon>-也没有  -那我想不到原因了
<7-26,Sheldon>- No. - Well, then, I'm all out of guesses.

196
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,780
<7-26,Sheldon>你居然让我搬到对面住
<7-26,Sheldon>What? Me move across the hall--

197
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,650
<7-26,Sheldon>这种话你怎么好意思说出口
<7-26,Sheldon>Why would you even suggest such a thing?

198
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:13,290
<7-27,Leonard>因为我爱佩妮
<7-27,Leonard>Because I love Penny,

199
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:16,000
<7-27,Leonard>我想给她她应得的生活
<7-27,Leonard>and want to give her the life she deserves.

200
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,540
<7-28,Sheldon>我明白了
<7-28,Sheldon>I see.

201
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:21,310
<7-28,Sheldon>看来你未来老婆的幸福生活远比我的重要
<7-28,Sheldon>You're putting your future bride's happiness above mine.

202
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:25,360
<7-29,Leonard>没错
<7-29,Leonard>Well, yeah.

203
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:38,380
<8-1,Sheldon>学校居然敢强迫我继续研究弦理论
<8-1,Sheldon>How dare the university force me to go back to string theory!

204
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:40,060
<8-2,Amy>那是他们不懂得欣赏你
<8-2,Amy>They just don't appreciate you.

205
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,550
<8-3,Sheldon>对啊  最过分的是
<8-3,Sheldon>Yeah, and on top of that,

206
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,380
<8-3,Sheldon>莱纳德居然厚颜无耻地提出
<8-3,Sheldon>Leonard has the audacity to suggest that

207
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,840
<8-3,Sheldon>因为他跟佩妮订婚了
<8-3,Sheldon>now that he and Penny are engaged,

208
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,890
<8-3,Sheldon>他可能不想再跟我一起住了
<8-3,Sheldon>he may not want to live with me anymore.

209
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:49,070
<8-4,Amy>给  我做了草莓热饮
<8-4,Amy>Here, I made you some Strawberry Quik.

210
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:51,280
<8-5,Sheldon>我现在有正经问题要处理  艾米
<8-5,Sheldon>I have real problems here, Amy.

211
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:54,470
<8-5,Sheldon>小孩喝的饮料怎么能平息我的怒火呢
<8-5,Sheldon>I can't be mollified with a beverage designed for children.

212
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,030
<8-5,Sheldon>哇  真好喝
<8-5,Sheldon>Mmm! Yummy.

213
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,210
<8-6,Amy>一切都会变好的
<8-6,Amy>You know, this might work out for the best.

214
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:01,840
<8-6,Amy>我是说  你总是抱怨
<8-6,Amy>I mean, you're always complaining about

215
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,980
<8-6,Amy>莱纳德是一位很糟糕的室友
<8-6,Amy>what a terrible roommate Leonard is.

216
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:06,520
<8-6,Amy>像上次你不在  他擅自打开了恒温器
<8-6,Amy>Like how he turns up the thermostat when you're not there.

217
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:09,540
<8-7,Sheldon>打开门就像走进了亚马逊
<8-7,Sheldon>It's like walking into the Amazon.

218
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:12,090
<8-7,Sheldon>而且还不是可以一日送货的亚马逊网站
<8-7,Sheldon>And not the good Amazon with one-day shipping.

219
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:15,540
<8-7,Sheldon>而是鸟多蛇多的亚马逊丛林
<8-7,Sheldon>The awful one with birds and snakes.

220
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,470
<8-8,Amy>你讨厌听到他钥匙扣上的碰撞声
<8-8,Amy>You hate the sound of all those keys on his key chain.

221
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:20,410
<8-9,Sheldon>整整四把钥匙
<8-9,Sheldon>Four keys!

222
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:22,900
<8-9,Sheldon>他以为他是谁  典狱长吗
<8-9,Sheldon>Who does he think he is, a warden?

223
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:26,560
<8-10,Amy>瞧  或许你会喜欢独居
<8-10,Amy>See? Maybe you'll love living alone.

224
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,680
<8-11,Sheldon>我不知道  或许吧
<8-11,Sheldon>I don't know. Perhaps.

225
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,930
<8-12,Amy>如果你发现自己不喜欢的话
<8-12,Amy>And if it turns out you don't...

226
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,700
<8-12,Amy>你可以跟我一起住啊
<8-12,Amy>you and I could live together.

227
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,310
<8-13,Sheldon>跟你住  是啊
<8-13,Sheldon>You and... Oh, sure.

228
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:38,870
<8-13,Sheldon>既然我们谈到这话题了  何不索性订个婚
<8-13,Sheldon>And while we're at it, why don't we get engaged, too?

229
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,980
<8-13,Sheldon>再买个房子  成个家
<8-13,Sheldon>Why don't we get a little house, start a family?

230
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,770
<8-13,Sheldon>然后一起慢慢变老
<8-13,Sheldon>Enjoy our sunset years together?

231
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:45,070
<8-13,Sheldon>拜托自重一点好吗  姑娘
<8-13,Sheldon>Do you hear yourself, woman?!

232
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:47,980
<8-14,Amy>谢尔顿  这只是一个想法而已
<8-14,Amy>Sheldon, it was just a thought.

233
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,250
<8-14,Amy>不  这才叫想法
<8-14,Amy>No. Here's a thought.

234
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,480
<8-15,Sheldon>你不准搬过来
<8-15,Sheldon>You're not moving in,

235
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,510
<8-15,Sheldon>莱纳德不准搬出去
<8-15,Sheldon>Leonard's not moving out,

236
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,670
<8-15,Sheldon>一切保持原状  不准改变
<8-15,Sheldon>everything stays exactly the way it is.

237
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,070
<8-15,Sheldon>对了  随便一提
<8-15,Sheldon>Yeah, and by the way,

238
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:57,270
<8-15,Sheldon>我看到你冲草莓热饮时偷加糖浆了
<8-15,Sheldon>I saw you make this Strawberry Quik with syrup,

239
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:59,290
<8-15,Sheldon>按规矩应该是加糖粉的
<8-15,Sheldon>and you're supposed to use the powder!

240
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:01,480
<8-16,Amy>喝起来不都一样吗
<8-16,Amy>It tastes the same.

241
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,530
<8-17,Sheldon>才怪  糖浆口感更好  人家不喜欢
<8-17,Sheldon>No. The syrup tastes better and I don't like it.

242
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,300
<9-1,Penny>太有爱了
<9-1,Penny>This is so sweet!

243
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,200
<9-1,Penny>-你从没给我做过饭  -那是因为
<9-1,Penny>- You never cook for me. - Well...

244
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,470
<9-2,Leonard>以前都是你做饭  而且...
<9-2,Leonard>you cook for me all the time and...

245
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:18,020
<9-3,Penny>你要是不喜欢我做的饭
<9-3,Penny>If you don't like my cooking,

246
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,400
<9-3,Penny>干嘛不早说
<9-3,Penny>why haven't you ever said anything?

247
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:23,180
<9-4,Leonard>每次都得猛嚼食物   哪里有空说话
<9-4,Leonard>It's hard to talk with so much heavy chewing to do.

248
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,030
<9-5,Penny>对不起  我会努力改进的
<9-5,Penny>Sorry. I'll get better.

249
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:28,710
<9-6,Leonard>我知道你会的
<9-6,Leonard>I know you'll try.

250
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:32,500
<9-6,Leonard>我们是不是该讨论一下婚礼的日子呢
<9-6,Leonard>So, should we talk about setting a date?

251
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,060
<9-7,Penny>我想挑一个我哥能参加的日子
<9-7,Penny>Well, I'd like to pick one that works with my brother's schedule.

252
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,000
<9-8,Leonard>好啊  大概是什么时候
<9-8,Leonard>Okay. And when would that be?

253
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,510
<9-9,Penny>如果他表现良好  一年或一年半以后吧
<9-9,Penny>Uh, 12 to 18 months from now, depending on good behavior.

254
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:44,000
<9-10,Amy>谢尔顿在吗
<9-10,Amy>Hi, is Sheldon here?

255
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,610
<9-11,Leonard>不在  我以为他跟你在一起呢
<9-11,Leonard>No, I thought he was with you.

256
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,280
<9-12,Amy>他来过  可又摔门而去
<9-12,Amy>He was, but he stormed off

257
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,840
<9-12,Amy>现在他连电话都不接了
<9-12,Amy>and now he isn't answering his phone.

258
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,750
<9-13,Leonard>出什么事了
<9-13,Leonard>What happened?

259
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,210
<9-14,Amy>他为了你让他搬家的事大发雷霆
<9-14,Amy>He was really angry that you suggested he move out.

260
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,010
<9-16,Amy>我建议他可以搬来和我同住
<9-16,Amy>I also mentioned that he and I could live together

261
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:56,180
<9-16,Amy>可他太生你的气了
<9-16,Amy>but he was too mad at you to realize

262
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,350
<9-16,Amy>都没注意到这个主意有多棒
<9-16,Amy>what a great idea that is.

263
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:02,670
<9-17,Leonard>这几天他的确不太好过
<9-17,Leonard>Well, he's been having a couple of tough days.

264
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:03,970
<9-17,Leonard>他会没事的  他只是需要
<9-17,Leonard>I'm sure he's fine. He probably just

265
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:06,550
<9-17,Leonard>一点时间来缓解压力
<9-17,Leonard>needs a little alone time to decompress.

266
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,800
<9-18,Amy>你说得对
<9-18,Amy>You're probably right.

267
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,190
<9-18,Amy>你们俩在干嘛呢
<9-18,Amy>So, what are you guys doing?

268
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:15,850
<9-19,Penny>莱纳德下了厨  我们作为
<9-19,Penny>Well, Leonard cooked for me and now we're just having

269
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:19,290
<9-19,Penny>新晋订婚的爱侣  正在享用美好的晚餐
<9-19,Penny>a nice dinner, you know, as a newly engaged couple.

270
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:21,320
<9-20,Amy>真幸福
<9-20,Amy>That's nice.

271
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,320
<9-21,Leonard>总之  就像我之前所说
<9-21,Leonard>Anyway, as I was saying,

272
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,000
<9-21,Leonard>谢尔顿大概只是需要独处一下
<9-21,Leonard>Sheldon probably just needs a little alone time.

273
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:35,610
<9-21,Leonard>独处是很重要的
<9-21,Leonard>'Cause that's important.

274
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,880
<9-21,Leonard>不光对他而言  而是对
<9-21,Leonard>Not just for him, but for...

275
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,780
<9-21,Leonard>大部分人而言  都很重要
<9-21,Leonard>most anybody, really.

276
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:45,460
<9-22,Amy>我也有同感呢
<9-22,Amy>Don't I know it.

277
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,580
<9-22,Amy>这是什么  玉米粥吗
<9-22,Amy>What is that, polenta?

278
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,400
<9-23,Penny>-艾米  快滚蛋  -好吧
<9-23,Penny>- Amy, get out. - Right.

279
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:56,000
<10-1,Sheldon>不会吧
<10-1,Sheldon>No.

280
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,270
<10-2,Stuart>嗨  谢尔顿
<10-2,Stuart>Hey, Sheldon.

281
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:01,630
<10-3,Sheldon>出什么事了
<10-3,Sheldon>What happened?

282
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:03,660
<10-4,Stuart>昨晚我在后面做饭
<10-4,Stuart>I was cooking in the back room last night

283
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,800
<10-4,Stuart>结果锅子起火了
<10-4,Stuart>and the hot plate caught on fire.

284
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:07,890
<10-5,Sheldon>你没把火扑灭吗
<10-5,Sheldon>And you couldn't put it out?

285
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:09,190
<10-6,Stuart>我当时正在街对面的
<10-6,Stuart>I was across the street

286
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:12,040
<10-6,Stuart>自助洗车行里洗澡呢
<10-6,Stuart>at the do-it-yourself car wash, taking a shower.

287
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,160
<10-7,Sheldon>那你准备何时重新开张
<10-7,Sheldon>So when will you reopen?

288
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,560
<10-8,Stuart>我不知道
<10-8,Stuart>Um, I don't know.

289
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,230
<10-8,Stuart>我还在等保险公司的答复
<10-8,Stuart>I'm waiting to hear back from the insurance company.

290
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:24,450
<10-9,Sheldon>就是明天吗
<10-9,Sheldon>So, tomorrow?

291
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:27,690
<10-10,Stuart>我不想太没礼貌  谢尔顿  可是
<10-10,Stuart>I don't mean to be rude, Sheldon, but, uh,

292
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:29,710
<10-10,Stuart>我的人生都快分崩离析了
<10-10,Stuart>my life is kind of falling apart right now.

293
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:31,050
<10-10,Stuart>你的人生
<10-10,Stuart>Your life?

294
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:33,800
<10-11,Sheldon>大学逼着我继续研究弦理论
<10-11,Sheldon>The university is making me do string theory

295
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,920
<10-11,Sheldon>我的女友爱我爱得想和我同居
<10-11,Sheldon>and my girlfriend loves me so much she wants to live with me.

296
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,910
<10-11,Sheldon>现在唯一能抚平我悲伤的小店
<10-11,Sheldon>And now, the place I need to go when I'm sad

297
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:44,110
<10-11,Sheldon>又湿又烂  还一股怪味
<10-11,Sheldon>is damp and smells funny.

298
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:47,330
<10-12,Stuart>抱歉让你失望了
<10-12,Stuart>Well, sorry I let you down.

299
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:48,260
<10-12,Stuart>不
<10-12,Stuart>No.

300
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,060
<10-13,Sheldon>我不能接受这种事
<10-13,Sheldon>I do not accept this.

301
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,110
<10-13,Sheldon>所有的一切都变了  我不喜欢这样
<10-13,Sheldon>Everything is changing and I hate it.

302
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,360
<10-13,Sheldon>我要阻止这种改变
<10-13,Sheldon>It stops now.

303
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,610
<10-13,Sheldon>我要帮你重新振作起来
<10-13,Sheldon>I'm helping you get back on your feet.

304
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,970
<10-13,Sheldon>我要买这本漫画  谢谢
<10-13,Sheldon>I would like to purchase this comic book, please.

305
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,590
<10-14,Stuart>2块9毛9
<10-14,Stuart>That'll be $2.99.

306
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:05,950
<10-15,Sheldon>不会吧  这书都泡湿了呢
<10-15,Sheldon>Really? It's soaking wet.

307
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,810
<10-16,Stuart>好吧  算你1块钱
<10-16,Stuart>Fine, a dollar.

308
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,460
<10-17,Sheldon>你找的开20元吗
<10-17,Sheldon>Can you break a 20?

309
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,730
<10-18,Stuart>不能  我只剩下百元大钞了
<10-18,Stuart>No, I only have hundreds.

310
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:17,340
<4-8,Leonard>你知道吗
<4-8,Leonard>You know what?

311
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:20,620
<10-18,Stuart>我一般都听不出讽刺  但我现在听懂了
<10-18,Stuart>I don't always recognize sarcasm, but I do right now,

312
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,270
<10-19,Sheldon>人家一点都不喜欢
<10-19,Sheldon>and I don't appreciate it.

313
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:24,080
<10-19,Sheldon>对你的损失  我感到惋惜
<10-19,Sheldon>I'm sorry for your loss.

314
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:27,390
<10-19,Sheldon>但你不是唯一遭受重创的人
<10-19,Sheldon>But you're not the only one whose day has been a disaster.

315
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:37,000
<10-20,Stuart>这玩意差点就能砸死我呢
<10-20,Stuart>That could have killed me.

316
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,140
<10-20,Stuart>还让不让人活了啊
<10-20,Stuart>I can't catch a break.

317
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:44,500
<11-1,Leonard>好久都没有谢尔顿的消息了
<11-1,Leonard>I haven't heard from Sheldon in a while.

318
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,600
<11-1,Leonard>他应该没事吧
<11-1,Leonard>You think he's okay?

319
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,570
<11-2,Penny>我保证他没事啦
<11-2,Penny>Oh, I'm sure he's fine.

320
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:49,440
<11-3,Leonard>我看看他人在哪里
<11-3,Leonard>I'm gonna see where he is.

321
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:50,680
<11-4,Penny>怎么看
<11-4,Penny>How?

322
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,470
<11-5,Leonard>我知道他的密码  所以可以追踪他的手机
<11-5,Leonard>Oh, I know his password, so I can track his phone.

323
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:54,910
<11-6,Penny>你居然做这种事
<11-6,Penny>You do that?

324
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:56,100
<11-7,Leonard>不是经常做
<11-7,Leonard>Not always,

325
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,630
<11-7,Leonard>但自从他在跳蚤市场追着气球跑迷路以后
<11-7,Leonard>but ever since he wandered off at the swap meet chasing a balloon,

326
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:00,520
<11-7,Leonard>我就多留一个心眼
<11-7,Leonard>I get worried.

327
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,650
<11-8,Penny>他会照顾好自己的
<11-8,Penny>He can take care of himself.

328
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:04,420
<11-8,Penny>我们教过他陌生人有多危险
<11-8,Penny>Look, we went over stranger danger

329
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,220
<11-8,Penny>也给他买了一只应急口哨
<11-8,Penny>and gave him that whistle.

330
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:09,500
<11-9,Leonard>-真奇怪  -怎么了
<11-9,Leonard>- That's weird. - What?

331
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,320
<11-11,Leonard>他人在火车站呢
<11-11,Leonard>He's at the train station.

332
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,150
<11-12,Penny>那又怎样  他最爱火车了
<11-12,Penny>So? He loves trains.

333
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:15,260
<11-13,Leonard>外面天黑了  他又独自一人  我感觉不对
<11-13,Leonard>It's dark out and he's alone, I don't like it.

334
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,440
<11-13,Leonard>我们去找他吧
<11-13,Leonard>Let's go get him.

335
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,730
<11-14,Penny>你这么照顾朋友  真是贴心
<11-14,Penny>Oh, it's sweet how you look out for him.

336
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:19,790
<11-14,Penny>你是个善良的人
<11-14,Penny>You're a good guy.

337
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,050
<11-15,Leonard>也不光是善良
<11-15,Leonard>It's not just that.

338
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:23,940
<11-15,Leonard>如果他出了事  我妈铁定不会放过我
<11-15,Leonard>My mother would kill me if I let something happen to him.

339
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:30,720
<12-1,Raj>老弟  我很抱歉
<12-1,Raj>Dude, I'm so sorry.

340
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,010
<12-2,Howard>你别介意我这么问
<12-2,Howard>Don't take this the wrong way,

341
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:34,800
<12-2,Howard>不过你是为了骗保险费吗
<12-2,Howard>but did you do this for the insurance money?

342
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,000
<12-3,Stuart>才不是  天啊  你怎么和警察  消防员
<12-3,Stuart>No. God, you sound like the police, the firemen,

343
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,270
<12-3,Stuart>我爹妈  我心理医生还有保险公司想得一样
<12-3,Stuart>my parents, my therapist and the insurance company.

344
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,400
<12-4,Raj>我们支持你  有任何需要就说话
<12-4,Raj>We're here for you, man. Whatever you need, okay?

345
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,010
<12-5,Stuart>其实呢  我在想能不能
<12-5,Stuart>Uh, actually, I was wondering if I could

346
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:47,890
<12-5,Stuart>在你家借宿几晚
<12-5,Stuart>crash at your place for a few nights.

347
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:49,200
<12-6,Raj>当然可以
<12-6,Raj>Sure, of course.

348
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,590
<12-6,Raj>不过  艾米丽今晚要来过夜呢
<12-6,Raj>Oh, actually, Emily was gonna spend the night.

349
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:53,900
<12-7,Stuart>你和她睡过了吗  行啊
<12-7,Stuart>You slept with her? Nice.

350
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,910
<12-8,Raj>不能说我有多能耐啦
<12-8,Raj>Well, I can't take all the credit.

351
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:58,110
<12-8,Raj>是她准我才上的  但是
<12-8,Raj>She let me do it to her, but...

352
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:02,690
<12-8,Raj>但我可以打电话跟她取消约会
<12-8,Raj>Uh, but I can always call her and cancel.

353
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:04,970
<12-9,Howard>慢着  我知道有个地方你可以住
<12-9,Howard>Hang on. I know a place you can stay

354
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:07,310
<12-9,Howard>而且还可以赚点钱
<12-9,Howard>and earn some money at the same time.

355
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:08,980
<12-11,Howard>-太好了  -只是我要警告你
<12-11,Howard>- Great. - I just have to warn you,

356
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:14,060
<12-11,Howard>这其中会涉及侮辱  没人格以及言语虐待
<12-11,Howard>it'll involve humiliation, degradation and verbal abuse.

357
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:16,970
<12-12,Stuart>这工作的陷阱在哪呢
<12-12,Stuart>So what's the catch?

358
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:23,830
<13-1,Leonard>谢尔顿
<13-1,Leonard>Sheldon.

359
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:26,640
<13-2,Sheldon>你追踪了我的电话
<13-2,Sheldon>You tracked my phone?

360
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,590
<13-3,Leonard>是的
<13-3,Leonard>Yeah.

361
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:32,240
<13-4,Sheldon>天啊  你追了我这颗气球整整3英里啊
<13-4,Sheldon>Boy, you chase one balloon for three miles.

362
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:35,930
<13-5,Penny>我们担心你
<13-5,Penny>We were worried about you.

363
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:37,860
<13-6,Sheldon>别这么夸张
<13-6,Sheldon>Don't be melodramatic.

364
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,850
<13-6,Sheldon>我只是准备登上火车  永远离开
<13-6,Sheldon>I'm just getting on a train and leaving forever.

365
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:42,950
<13-6,Sheldon>你不是吧
<13-6,Sheldon>Seriously?

366
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:45,940
<13-7,Leonard>你甚至没带换洗衣物和牙刷
<13-7,Leonard>You don't even have a change of clothes or a toothbrush.

367
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:48,870
<13-8,Sheldon>我的计划是路过商场时买必需物品
<13-8,Sheldon>My plan is to stop at malls and buy what I need.

368
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:51,220
<13-8,Sheldon>这叫靠山吃山  靠水吃水
<13-8,Sheldon>It's called living off the land.

369
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,390
<13-9,Leonard>我知道你不高兴
<13-9,Leonard>Okay, I know you're upset

370
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:55,120
<13-9,Leonard>发生了太多事
<13-9,Leonard>and there's a lot of stuff going on,

371
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,860
<13-9,Leonard>但一切都好商量
<13-9,Leonard>but it's nothing we can't work out.

372
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,100
<13-9,Leonard>来吧  咱们回家
<13-9,Leonard>Come on, let's get you home.

373
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,520
<13-10,Sheldon>不  我已经到达了人生的奔溃点了
<13-10,Sheldon>No. I've reached my breaking point.

374
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,450
<13-10,Sheldon>我需要离开  现在就走
<13-10,Sheldon>I need to leave. Now.

375
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:03,650
<13-11,Penny>去哪里
<13-11,Penny>And go where?

376
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:05,230
<13-12,Sheldon>这不重要
<13-12,Sheldon>It doesn't matter.

377
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:08,370
<13-13,Leonard>生活中有几件事不如你意
<13-13,Leonard>So a few things don't go your way

378
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:12,350
<13-13,Leonard>你就决定像个流浪汉般坐火车远走高飞吗
<13-13,Leonard>and your best decision is to ride the rails like a hobo?

379
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,100
<13-14,Sheldon>我想是的
<13-14,Sheldon>I suppose it is.

380
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,100
<13-14,Sheldon>只是我有信用卡
<13-14,Sheldon>Except I have a credit card.

381
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:21,260
<13-14,Sheldon>我拒绝用扁担挑着笔记本走
<13-14,Sheldon>And I refuse to carry my laptop at the end of a stick.

382
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:27,380
<13-14,Sheldon>而且我宁死也不愿吃罐头豆子
<13-14,Sheldon>And I'd sooner die than eat beans out of a can.

383
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,780
<13-15,Leonard>拜托  和我们回家吧
<13-15,Leonard>Come on, come home with us

384
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,930
<13-15,Leonard>明天我带你去乐高乐园
<13-15,Leonard>and tomorrow I'll-I'll take you to Legoland.

385
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:34,820
<13-16,Sheldon>乐高乐园不是一切问题的解决办法
<13-16,Sheldon>Legoland is not the solution to everything.

386
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,620
<13-16,Sheldon>而且《乐高大电影》问世后
<13-16,Sheldon>And it's too much of a scene

387
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,800
<13-16,Sheldon>那里就人满为患了
<13-16,Sheldon>since that movie came out.

388
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:42,340
<13-17,Leonard>那我能做些什么
<13-17,Leonard>Then what can I do?

389
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,770
<13-18,Sheldon>莱纳德  我不知所措
<13-18,Sheldon>Leonard, I am overwhelmed.

390
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:48,050
<13-18,Sheldon>一切都在改变  多到让人无法接受
<13-18,Sheldon>Everything is changing and it's simply too much.

391
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:50,120
<13-18,Sheldon>我需要离开  好好想想
<13-18,Sheldon>I need to get away and think.

392
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,650
<13-19,Leonard>拜托  你知道你自己是反应过度了
<13-19,Leonard>Oh, c-come on, you know you're overreacting.

393
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:53,530
<13-20,Penny>莱纳德  等等
<13-20,Penny>Leonard, hang on.

394
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,530
<13-20,Penny>过来一下
<13-20,Penny>Just... come here for a second.

395
00:17:57,970 --> 00:17:59,700
<13-20,Penny>也许我们需要让他走
<13-20,Penny>Maybe we need to let him go.

396
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,330
<13-21,Leonard>什么  为什么呀
<13-21,Leonard>What?! Why?

397
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,530
<13-22,Penny>也许对他有好处
<13-22,Penny>It might be good for him.

398
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:05,560
<13-23,Leonard>你知道他没办法这样一个人旅行
<13-23,Leonard>Y-You know he can't take a trip like this by himself.

399
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,820
<13-24,Penny>他是个成年人
<13-24,Penny>He's a grown man.

400
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:09,810
<13-25,Leonard>不  他外表是成年人
<13-25,Leonard>No, he looks like a grown man.

401
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:12,440
<13-25,Leonard>你也看过《辣妈辣妹》
<13-25,Leonard>You've seen Freaky Friday,

402
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:15,530
<13-25,Leonard>有时候小孩子的灵魂会换到大人的身体里
<13-25,Leonard>sometimes little kids end up in big person bodies.

403
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,230
<13-26,Penny>莱纳德  我们不能永远保护他
<13-26,Penny>Leonard, we can't protect him forever.

404
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:20,410
<13-27,Leonard>我知道  但是
<13-27,Leonard>I know, but...

405
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:22,140
<13-28,Penny>他不会有事的
<13-28,Penny>He'll be okay.

406
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,150
<13-28,Penny>你把他教得很好  巴达旺[绝地学徒]
<13-28,Penny>You taught him well, Padawan.

407
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:25,120
<13-29,Sheldon>老天爷
<13-29,Sheldon>Good Lord!

408
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,180
<13-29,Sheldon>巴达旺是学生  不是老师
<13-29,Sheldon>Padawan's the student, not the teacher.

409
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:32,190
<13-30,Penny>真的  让他滚
<13-30,Penny>Seriously, let him go.

410
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,840
<13-31,Leonard>谢尔顿  如果你真的想这样
<13-31,Leonard>Sheldon, if you really need to do this,

411
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,730
<13-31,Leonard>我不会拦着你
<13-31,Leonard>I'm not gonna stand in your way.

412
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,020
<13-32,Sheldon>我想
<13-32,Sheldon>I do.

413
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,330
<13-32,Sheldon>好吧
<13-32,Sheldon>Okay.

414
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,420
<13-33,Leonard>一路顺风
<13-33,Leonard>Good luck.

415
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,510
<13-34,Penny>注意安全  打电话给我们
<13-34,Penny>Be safe and call us.

416
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:58,970
<13-35,Sheldon>我会的
<13-35,Sheldon>I will.

417
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:02,500
<13-36,Leonard>再见  兄弟
<13-36,Leonard>Bye, buddy.

418

420
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,150
<13-38,Leonard>我会想你的
<13-38,Leonard>I'm gonna miss you.

421
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,950
<13-39,Sheldon>这不废话吗
<13-39,Sheldon>Of course you are.

422
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,960
<13-40,Leonard>慢走不送
<13-40,Leonard>He just made that easier.

423
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:34,300
<14-1,Stuart>你们怎么还在这里
<14-1,Stuart>What are you guys still doing here?

424

00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:42,000
<14-3,Stuart>她吃过饭  吃过药
<14-3,Stuart>Yeah, she's fed, she took her pills,

427
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,140
<14-3,Stuart>已经盖好被子看电视了
<14-3,Stuart>she's all tucked in and watching TV.

428
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,800
<14-4,Bernadette>你没觉得她难伺候吗
<14-4,Bernadette>So, she's not too much for you?

429
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,470
<14-5,Stuart>开什么玩笑  我爱她  她太棒了
<14-5,Stuart>Are you kidding? I love her, she's great.

430
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:53,360

00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,090
<14-9,Stuart>这份工作真是美梦成真
<14-9,Stuart>This job is a dream come true.

436
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:13,190
<14-10,Howard>这是不是有些奇怪
<14-10,Howard>Was that a little weird?

437
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:14,910
<14-11,Bernadette>是的  我不知道原因
<14-11,Bernadette>Yeah. I don't know why,

438
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:17,500
<14-11,Bernadette>但这事有些地方让人觉得
<14-11,Bernadette>but something about it feels...

439
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:20,070
<14-11,Bernadette>逆天了
<14-11,Bernadette>unnatural.

440
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,920
<14-13,Bernadette>-好啦  咱们走人  -好滴
<14-13,Bernadette>- Okay, let's go. - Yep.

<15-1,Amy (on phone)>谢尔顿  多谢打电话来
<15-1,Amy (on phone)>Okay, Sheldon, thanks for checking in.

445
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:36,900
<15-3,Amy>居然听起来非常好

<15-4,Penny>我真心觉得这样最好
<15-4,Penny>I really think this is gonna be for the best.

<15-5,Leonard>我也是
<15-5,Leonard>Me, too.

448
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:42,750
<15-5,Leonard>这样他可以休下大学给的假期
<15-5,Leonard>And he was able to take a sabbatical from...

449
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,490
<15-6,Amy>你这个天杀的怎么能放他走呢
<15-6,Amy>How could you let him go?
