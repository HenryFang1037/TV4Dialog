18
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,910
<1-11,Penny>"这叫维恩的家伙  什么时候能不说这图了"
<1-11,Penny>"Venn is he gonna stop talking about this diagram?"

00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:11,890
<1-22,Leonard>既然你都要去机场了
<1-22,Leonard>um, since you're already gonna be at the airport,

31
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:13,880
<1-22,Leonard>我还有去的必要吗
<1-22,Leonard>do I need to go?

32
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:16,640
<1-23,Sheldon>你为什么不想去机场接你妈妈
<1-23,Sheldon>Why don't you want to get your mother from the airport?

33
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,860
<1-24,Leonard>因为我的人生不需要增加一段
<1-24,Leonard>Well, I can do without the 40-minute car ride

34
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:21,740
<1-24,Leonard>对我人生长达40分钟的全方位嘲讽
<1-24,Leonard>where she criticizes every aspect of my life.

35
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,360
<1-25,Sheldon>她一趟车程就能全说完了吗
<1-25,Sheldon>She can cover it in a car ride?

36
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,910
<1-25,Sheldon>光是你的姿势我就能说40分钟呢
<1-25,Sheldon>I could do 40 minutes on your posture alone.

37
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,790
<1-26,Penny>你真的想要我一个人去接你妈吗
<1-26,Penny>You really want me to pick up your mother all by myself?

38
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,140
<1-27,Leonard>我只是觉得
<1-27,Leonard>Hmm, I just feel like

39
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:33,960
<1-27,Leonard>这是你们俩增进感情的好机会
<1-27,Leonard>it would be a good chance for you to bond.

40
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,300
<1-28,Penny>或是你避开她的好机会吗
<1-28,Penny>Or a way for you to avoid her?

41
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,870
<1-29,Leonard>我不知道他的卡上都写了什么
<1-29,Leonard>I don't know what he's putting on those cards,

42
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:40,470
<1-29,Leonard>但你机智程度破了你人生记录啊
<1-29,Leonard>but you are smarter than ever.

43
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:43,440
<1-30,Penny>如果真想我去  那我就去接你妈妈吧
<1-30,Penny>Fine, if you really want me to, I will pick your mom up.

44
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,600
<1-31,Leonard>真的吗
<1-31,Leonard>Seriously?

45
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,160
<1-32,Penny>对啊  毕竟她也是我婆婆
<1-32,Penny>Yeah, you know what, she is my mother-in-law,

46
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,390
<1-32,Penny>我也想我们能好好相处
<1-32,Penny>and I'd like for us to have a good relationship.

47
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,310
<1-33,Leonard>你这行为好成熟
<1-33,Leonard>That is very mature of you,

48
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,550
<1-33,Leonard>所以我决定告诉你  "傻逼"
<1-33,Leonard>so I'm gonna go ahead and say, "Suckah."

49
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,040
<1-34,Sheldon>-继续学习  -好的
<1-34,Sheldon>- All right, back to learning. - Okay.

<1-37,Penny>我印象中的他是...
<1-37,Penny>Or as I know him...

52

<1-38,Sheldon>"《与星共舞》里的怪老头"
<1-38,Sheldon>"Creepy old dude from Dancing with the Stars."

63
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,370
<2-1,Raj>你们知道最近有场《复仇者联盟》的放映吗
<2-1,Raj>Did you guys see there's an Avengers screening?

64
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:35,610
<2-1,Raj>这戏的导演会放出删减的片段
<2-1,Raj>Joss Whedon's gonna show some deleted scenes

65
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,330
<2-1,Raj>还会有一个问与答的环节
<2-1,Raj>and do a question and answer session.

66
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:39,250
<2-2,Sheldon>我对于上一部《复仇者联盟》电影
<2-2,Sheldon>Oh, well, I have a few questions for him

67
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,920
<2-2,Sheldon>有几个问题想问他
<2-2,Sheldon>about the last Avengers movie...

68
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,680
<2-2,Sheldon>还有一大堆吐槽答案
<2-2,Sheldon>and a whole lot of answers.

69
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:45,360
<2-3,Leonard>活动是什么时候
<2-3,Leonard>When's the screening?

70
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,500
<2-4,Raj>今晚  但是谁先来谁有座
<2-4,Raj>Uh, it's tonight, but it's first-come, first-served,

71
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,860
<2-4,Raj>所以我们应该提早去排队
<2-4,Raj>so we should probably get there early and wait in line.

72
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,040
<2-5,Howard>咱们去吧
<2-5,Howard>Let's do it.

73
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,220
<2-6,Leonard>佩妮得忙着陪我妈妈  我也去
<2-6,Leonard>Penny's busy with my mother, so I'm in.

74
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,640
<2-7,Sheldon>有个坏消息
<2-7,Sheldon>Oh, bad news.

75
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,380
<2-7,Sheldon>艾米叫我晚点陪她去逛街
<2-7,Sheldon>Amy's making me go shopping with her later,

76
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:59,670
<2-7,Sheldon>所以大家都别想去了
<2-7,Sheldon>so looks like none of us can go.

77
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,490
<2-8,Leonard>你知道你不在场时我们也有权享乐的吧
<2-8,Leonard>You do realize we're allowed to have fun without you?

78
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:07,610
<2-9,Howard>通常就是因为你不在才能享乐
<2-9,Howard>In fact, that's usually the trick to it.

79
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,420
<2-9,Howard>我们几点得到
<2-9,Howard>What time do we need to get there?

80
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,770
<2-10,Raj>我觉得3点吧
<2-10,Raj>Uh, I'd say by 3:00.

81
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,840
<2-11,Sheldon>你们真的要抛下我去玩吗
<2-11,Sheldon>You're really going without me?

82
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,010
<2-12,Leonard>不是什么大事
<2-12,Leonard>It's not a big deal.

83
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,080
<2-12,Leonard>去跟艾米逛街吧
<2-12,Leonard>Go shopping with Amy,

84
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,800
<2-12,Leonard>到时候我们帮你占一个位置
<2-12,Leonard>and we'll save a spot in line for you.

85
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,590
<2-13,Sheldon>你没有权利在队伍中帮人占位置
<2-13,Sheldon>You don't have the authority to save places in the line.

86
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:21,980
<2-13,Sheldon>如果我这么做  那就是插队了
<2-13,Sheldon>If I do that, I'll be cutting.

87
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,420
<2-14,Leonard>大家都这样啊
<2-14,Leonard>People do it all the time.

88
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,050
<2-15,Sheldon>你知道排队的黄金条例
<2-15,Sheldon>You know the golden rule of line etiquette:

89
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:27,910
<2-15,Sheldon>"插队死全家"
<2-15,Sheldon>"No cuts, no buts, no coconuts."

90
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,840
<2-16,Howard>如果你真这么在意
<2-16,Howard>If you really care that much,

91
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,490
<2-16,Howard>现在也有很多软件可以让你花钱请人
<2-16,Howard>there are apps now that'll let you hire people to do stuff

92
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:35,260
<2-16,Howard>代跑腿或者代排队啊
<2-16,Howard>like errands and wait in lines.

93
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:38,460
<2-17,Stuart>真有人的工作是排队吗
<2-17,Stuart>People are actually waiting in lines as a job?

94
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:41,980
<2-17,Stuart>突然对自己的人生产生满足感
<2-17,Stuart>Boy, makes me feel better about my life.

95
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,360
<2-18,Howard>他们其中有些人时薪超过20块呢
<2-18,Howard>Some of these guys make over $20 an hour.

96
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,940
<2-19,Stuart>现在我又悲伤感爆棚了
<2-19,Stuart>And now I feel worse again.

97
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:52,270
<3-1,Beverly>我一点都不惊讶莱纳德选择逃避接机
<3-1,Beverly>I'm not surprised Leonard chose to avoid picking me up.

98
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:55,600
<3-1,Beverly>他这辈子都在克服亲密关系问题
<3-1,Beverly>He's battled intimacy issues his whole life.

99
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:59,150
<3-1,Beverly>他对于保持勃起状态会有困难吗
<3-1,Beverly>Does he have difficulty maintaining erections?

100
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:04,450
<3-2,Penny>都还没开出停车场呢
<3-2,Penny>Didn't even make it out of the parking lot.

101
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:06,350
<3-2,Penny>莱纳德的事说够多了
<3-2,Penny>Uh, you know what, enough about Leonard.

102
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:07,760
<3-2,Penny>来说说你的事吧
<3-2,Penny>Let's talk about you.

103
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,510
<3-2,Penny>你这次来这里  有想做什么吗
<3-2,Penny>What would you like to do while you're here?

104
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:11,480
<3-3,Beverly>亲爱的  我是个心理医生
<3-3,Beverly>Dear, I'm a psychiatrist.

105
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:15,280
<3-3,Beverly>你不用逃避跟我谈论私密的话题
<3-3,Beverly>You don't have to avoid having intimate conversations with me.

106
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,750
<3-4,Penny>其实我也想跟你变得亲近
<3-4,Penny>Well, I'd actually like for us to be close,

107
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,650
<3-4,Penny>或许我们可以聊聊我们最喜欢的书
<3-4,Penny>but maybe we start with our favorite books

108
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:23,190
<3-4,Penny>然后再慢慢聊到我丈夫的性器官
<3-4,Penny>and work our way up to my husband's sex organs.

109
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,430
<3-5,Beverly>没问题
<3-5,Beverly>Very well.

110
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:27,020

<3-5,Beverly>What's the last book you read?

111
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:31,640
<3-6,Penny>家具店春季目录算吗
<3-6,Penny>Um, does Pottery Barn, Spring count?

112
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:35,740
<3-7,Beverly>佩妮  想要自己的婆婆喜欢自己很正常
<3-7,Beverly>Penny, it's only natural to want your mother-in-law to like you,

113
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:39,350
<3-7,Beverly>我承认我有时过于强势吓人
<3-7,Beverly>and I acknowledge I can be an intimidating person.

114
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:42,450
<3-7,Beverly>我该怎么做才能让你自在点呢
<3-7,Beverly>So what can I do to make this process easier for you?

115
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:43,320
<3-8,Penny>比如说
<3-8,Penny>Uh, for starters,

116
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,690
<3-8,Penny>你能不能不要跟我玩精神分析这一套
<3-8,Penny>maybe you can not psychoanalyze everything I say?

117
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:48,260
<3-9,Beverly>那当我精神分析你时
<3-9,Beverly>And how does it make you feel

118
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:51,690
<3-9,Beverly>你有什么感觉呢
<3-9,Beverly>when I psychoanalyze everything you say?

119
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:53,700
<3-10,Penny>很不舒服
<3-10,Penny>Uncomfortable.

120
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,170
<3-11,Beverly>亲爱的  我刚才在开玩笑
<3-11,Beverly>That was a joke, dear.

121
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,420
<3-12,Penny>抱歉
<3-12,Penny>Oh. Sorry.

122
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:59,370
<3-12,Penny>不知道你还会开玩笑
<3-12,Penny>Didn't know you made those.

<3-13,Beverly>So just the two of us?

126
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,360

<3-14,Penny>Or I invite a few girlfriends,

127
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,620
<3-14,Penny>因为听到你说"就咱俩"时
<3-14,Penny>'cause hearing you say "The two of us"

128
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,700

00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,130
<4-3,Stuart>我早料到你可能会这么说
<4-3,Stuart>I thought that might come up.

132
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:28,630
<4-3,Stuart>谢尔顿花钱雇我  让我跟你去逛街
<4-3,Stuart>Sheldon hired me to go shopping with you.

133
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:29,920
<4-4,Amy>慢着
<4-4,Amy>Hold on.

134
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,890
<4-4,Amy>他给你钱  好不用跟我一起待着是吗
<4-4,Amy>He paid you to get out of spending time with me?

135
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:34,990
<4-5,Stuart>不  不是那样的
<4-5,Stuart>No, it's not like that.

136
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:38,330
<4-5,Stuart>是他宁可去排一条长长的队
<4-5,Stuart>There's a long line he'd rather stand in.

137
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:41,180
<4-5,Stuart>我们要做什么  你想买衣服还是做玩具熊
<4-5,Stuart>So what are we doing? Old Navy, Build-A-Bear?

138
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,220
<4-5,Stuart>反正做啥我都有钱拿
<4-5,Stuart>I get paid either way.

139
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:46,900
<4-6,Amy>我才不会跟你去逛街
<4-6,Amy>We're not going shopping together.

140
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,770
<4-7,Stuart>你确定吗  我可是很乐意帮你拿包包哦
<4-7,Stuart>You sure? I'm happy to hold your bag.

141
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:52,040
<4-7,Stuart>谢尔顿还给了我买热狗棒的钱
<4-7,Stuart>And Sheldon gave me money for a hotdog on a stick.

142
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:56,290
<4-8,Amy>你能理解为什么我现在很火大吗
<4-8,Amy>Can you understand why I might be annoyed right now?

143
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:59,600
<4-9,Stuart>女士  我今天才第一天上班
<4-9,Stuart>Look, lady, I just work here.

144
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,440
<5-1,Howard>我们一起排过很多次队  对吧
<5-1,Howard>We've waited in a lot of lines together, haven't we?

145
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,490
<5-2,Sheldon>还记得我们为了漫展
<5-2,Sheldon>Remember when we camped out

146
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:09,360
<5-2,Sheldon>《神秘博士》的剧组在外露营了吗
<5-2,Sheldon>for the Doctor Who panel at Comic-Con?

147
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,050
<5-3,Raj>记得  露宿在星空下
<5-3,Raj>Yeah, sleeping under the stars

148
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:13,270
<5-3,Raj>跟一群像我们一样热爱这部剧的粉丝们
<5-3,Raj>with other fans who love the show as much as we do.

149
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:17,310
<5-4,Leonard>醒来后寻思  到底是哪个粉丝偷了我们的钱包
<5-4,Leonard>Waking up, wondering which one of those fans stole our wallets.

150
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,580
<5-5,Sheldon>斯尔图特  你来这里干嘛
<5-5,Sheldon>Stuart, what are you doing here?

151
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,140
<5-6,Stuart>谢尔顿  你是我这辈子见过
<5-6,Stuart>Sheldon, you are the most inconsiderate person

152
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:25,330
<5-6,Stuart>最不顾及别人感受的人
<5-6,Stuart>I have ever met in my entire life!

153
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:27,450
<5-6,Stuart>你哪儿来的胆子  居然让我
<5-6,Stuart>Where do you get off sending me

154
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:29,950
<5-6,Stuart>去陪你女朋友逛街
<5-6,Stuart>to shop with your girlfriend?!

155
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,150
<5-6,Stuart>我糊涂了
<5-6,Stuart>I don't understand.

156
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:32,780
<5-7,Sheldon>之前给你钱时  你不是很乐意这么做吗
<5-7,Sheldon>You were happy to do this when I hired you.

157
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,740
<5-7,Sheldon>为什么现在对我这么不爽
<5-7,Sheldon>Why-why are you upset with me now?

158
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:38,010
<5-8,Stuart>不是我对你不爽  但艾米现在超级不爽你
<5-8,Stuart>Oh, I'm not upset with you, but Amy's pretty bent out of shape,

159
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:42,370
<5-8,Stuart>所以她花钱请我来骂你
<5-8,Stuart>so she hired me to let you have it.

160
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,760
<5-9,Sheldon>天道好轮回  苍天饶过谁
<5-9,Sheldon>Well, I suppose turnabout is fair play.

161
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:49,780
<5-10,Stuart>你他妈说对了  你个自私的混蛋
<5-10,Stuart>You're darn right it's fair play, you selfish jerk!

162
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,800
<6-1,Amy>正当我觉得
<6-1,Amy>You know, just when I think

163
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,490
<6-1,Amy>我们的关系取得进展时
<6-1,Amy>we're making progress in our relationship,

164
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:57,010
<6-1,Amy>我们又恢复原状
<6-1,Amy>we revert to our old patterns

165
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:58,970
<6-1,Amy>他有什么想法和情绪都不告诉我
<6-1,Amy>where thoughts and feelings go unexpressed.

166
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:00,590
<6-1,Amy>我是说  如果他不想跟我去逛街
<6-1,Amy>I mean, if he didn't want to go shopping with me,

167
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:02,890
<6-1,Amy>那他干嘛不直接说
<6-1,Amy>why didn't he just say so?

168
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:06,850
<6-2,Beverly>或许是因为他插不上嘴
<6-2,Beverly>Maybe he couldn't get a word in edgewise.

169
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,560
<6-3,Amy>抱歉  我一直喋喋不休
<6-3,Amy>I'm sorry, I've been going on and on.

170
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,110
<6-4,Beverly>没关系  亲爱的
<6-4,Beverly>Oh, it's all right, dear.

171
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:15,290
<6-4,Beverly>谢尔顿的大脑睿智又复杂
<6-4,Beverly>Sheldon has a brilliant and complicated mind.

172
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:18,150
<6-4,Beverly>我可以理解跟他谈恋爱
<6-4,Beverly>It's understandable that being in a relationship with him

173
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,440
<6-4,Beverly>会比较费劲
<6-4,Beverly>could be trying.

174
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:20,680
<6-5,Amy>我有次叫了他"宝贝"
<6-5,Amy>I called him "babe" once.

175
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,020
<6-5,Amy>他怀疑我嗑药  要我药检
<6-5,Amy>He asked me to get a drug test.

176
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,310
<6-6,Beverly>我真的很佩服你的决心
<6-6,Beverly>Well, I do admire your resolve.

177
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:30,470
<6-6,Beverly>-你是一名非凡的女性  -谢谢
<6-6,Beverly>- You're an extraordinary woman. - Thank you.

178
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:32,080
<6-8,Penny>她是我婆婆
<6-8,Penny>You know, she's my mother-in-law.

179
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,280
<6-8,Penny>为什么我不能跟她像这样热络呢
<6-8,Penny>Why can't I bond with her like that?

180
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,350
<6-9,Bernadette>艾米跟她视如己出的谢尔顿在一起
<6-9,Bernadette>Amy's with Sheldon who she loves like a son.

181
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:38,830
<6-9,Bernadette>而你跟她...
<6-9,Bernadette>You're with her son...

182
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:41,280
<6-9,Bernadette>视如外人的儿子在一起
<6-9,Bernadette>who she doesn't.

183
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:45,120
<6-10,Amy>你知道我们谈了五年  他才愿意给我做按摩吗
<6-10,Amy>Do you realize it took me five years to get a massage from him?

184
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,060
<6-11,Beverly>那对谢尔顿来说  也算是很大的进步了
<6-11,Beverly>Oh, well, that still could be a big step for Sheldon.

185
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,620
<6-12,Amy>三分钟
<6-12,Amy>Three minutes.

186
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,930
<6-12,Amy>他用了一个厨房计时器计时
<6-12,Amy>And he used a kitchen timer.

187
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,940
<6-12,Amy>我觉得自己就像一颗溏心蛋
<6-12,Amy>I felt like a soft-boiled egg.

188
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,570
<6-13,Penny>跟莱纳德一起相处
<6-13,Penny>You know, being in a relationship with Leonard

189
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:02,130
<6-13,Penny>也是挑战满满哦
<6-13,Penny>also comes with its challenges.

190
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:03,140
<6-13,Penny>是啊
<6-13,Penny>Yes.

191
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:05,630
<6-14,Beverly>但你又能怎么样呢
<6-14,Beverly>Well, what can you do?

192
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:12,510
<6-15,Amy (knock on door)>或许是谢尔顿来道歉了
<6-15,Amy (knock on door)>Maybe it's Sheldon, here to say he's sorry.

193
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:15,260
<6-16,Stuart>谢尔顿说对不起
<6-16,Stuart>Sheldon says he's sorry.

194
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:20,260
<6-17,Amy>伯纳黛特  我给你五块钱  使劲摔门
<6-17,Amy>Bernadette, I'll give you five dollars to slam the door.

195
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,220
<6-18,Stuart>我收三块就行
<6-18,Stuart>I would have done it for three.

196
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,640
<7-1,Raj>天啊  站这么久我好累啊
<7-1,Raj>Boy, all this standing's making me tired.

197
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:34,320
<7-1,Raj>还好我带了我的手杖折叠椅
<7-1,Raj>Good thing I brought my collapsible stick chair.

198
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,040
<7-2,Howard>我讨厌那椅子
<7-2,Howard>Not the stick chair.

199
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,100
<7-2,Howard>你坐在那玩意上像个傻子
<7-2,Howard>You look like an idiot on that thing.

200
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,100
<7-3,Raj>棍杖和石头或许会弄断我的骨头
<7-3,Raj>Sticks and stones may break my bones,

201
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:44,310
<7-3,Raj>但在棍杖上的椅子  超舒服哦
<7-3,Raj>but chairs on sticks are comfy.

202
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,450
<7-5,Sheldon>艾米的事摆平了吗
<7-5,Sheldon>Is everything smoothed out with Amy?

203
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:50,760
<7-6,Stuart>没有  她还是很生气
<7-6,Stuart>Uh, no, she's still pretty mad.

204
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:54,410
<7-7,Sheldon>你道歉的时候  有像我那样真诚吗
<7-7,Sheldon>Did you make the apology as sincere as I would have?

205
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:56,820
<7-8,Stuart>我说"谢尔顿说对不起"
<7-8,Stuart>I said, "Sheldon says he's sorry."

206
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,750
<7-9,Sheldon>那有点过分真诚了
<7-9,Sheldon>Oh, well, that's laying it on a little thick.

207
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,510
<7-10,Leonard>你该亲自去跟她道歉了吧
<7-10,Leonard>You think it's time you apologize to her yourself?

208
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:05,880
<7-11,Sheldon>我想也是
<7-11,Sheldon>I suppose so.

209
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,090
<7-11,Sheldon>但如果我走出队伍  我的位置就没了
<7-11,Sheldon>But if I get out of the line, I'll lose my spot.

210
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:10,600
<7-12,Stuart>我很乐意帮你保留位置等你回来
<7-12,Stuart>I'm happy to hold your place till you get back.

211
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,690
<7-13,Sheldon>你会这么做吗
<7-13,Sheldon>You would do that?

212
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:14,670
<7-14,Stuart>就当这是我坑你钱的方式吧
<7-14,Stuart>Consider it my way of getting more of your money.

213
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,810
<7-15,Sheldon>你真是一个好人
<7-15,Sheldon>You're a good man.

214
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,630
<8-1,Bernadette>贝弗莉  你知道佩妮
<8-1,Bernadette>So, Beverly, did you know Penny

215
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:24,270
<8-1,Bernadette>是我们制药公司业绩第三名的销售代表吗
<8-1,Bernadette>is the number three sales rep at our pharmaceutical company?

216
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:26,490
<8-2,Beverly>我都不知道你们俩一起工作
<8-2,Beverly>Oh, I didn't realize you two work together.

217
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:27,500
<8-3,Bernadette>其实不算是
<8-3,Bernadette>Well, we don't exactly.

218
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,630
<8-3,Bernadette>我是研发团队的微生物学家
<8-3,Bernadette>I'm a microbiologist for the research team.

219
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,200
<8-4,Beverly>你们最近在研发什么
<8-4,Beverly>Oh, what are you currently developing?

220
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,500
<8-5,Bernadette>一种抗焦虑的新药
<8-5,Bernadette>Some exciting new anti-anxiety drugs.

221
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,390
<8-6,Beverly>真是巧了
<8-6,Beverly>That's interesting.

222
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:37,850
<8-6,Beverly>我刚参加了一个关于儿童焦虑症的讲座
<8-6,Beverly>I just attended a lecture on pediatric anxiety.

223
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:39,680
<8-7,Amy>是不是杰诺夫斯基博士的讲座
<8-7,Amy>Oh, was it, uh, Dr. Jenofski?

224
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,960
<8-7,Amy>我才看了他的TED演讲
<8-7,Amy>I just saw his TED Talk!

225
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,130
<8-8,Beverly>正是他的
<8-8,Beverly>It was.

226
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:43,550
<8-9,Bernadette>我们还是聊回佩妮吧
<8-9,Bernadette>Let's get back to Penny.

227
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:44,840
<8-9,Bernadette>对了  你之前不是提起过
<8-9,Bernadette>Hey, weren't you telling me

00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,840
<8-9,Bernadette>公司给你的那辆车有多棒吗
<8-9,Bernadette>something great about your company car?

229
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:53,860
<8-10,Penny>车上有座椅加热器
<8-10,Penny>It has seat warmers.

230
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:57,720
<8-11,Sheldon>艾米  艾米

<8-13,Sheldon>大家好

<8-13,Sheldon>贝弗利  很高兴见到你
<8-13,Sheldon>Oh, Beverly, good to see you!

234
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:04,520
<8-13,Sheldon>我本想坐下来小聊一下  但是
<8-13,Sheldon>I'd love to chat, but there's a line

235
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,460
<8-13,Sheldon>我们排的队马上就要进场了  所以我就直说了
<8-13,Sheldon>that could start moving any minute, so let's do this.

236
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,370
<8-13,Sheldon>艾米
<8-13,Sheldon>Amy?

237
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:09,500
<8-13,Sheldon>一个完整的道歉需要以下三个步骤
<8-13,Sheldon>A proper apology requires three steps.

238
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,420
<8-13,Sheldon>第一步  承认错误
<8-13,Sheldon>Step one-- an admission of wrongdoing.

239
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,810
<8-13,Sheldon>艾米  我错了
<8-13,Sheldon>Amy, I was wrong.

240
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:13,800
<8-13,Sheldon>第二步
<8-13,Sheldon>Step two--

241
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,550
<8-13,Sheldon>承诺再也不犯同样的错误
<8-13,Sheldon>a promise never to repeat said action.

242
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:17,400
<8-13,Sheldon>艾米  我再也不会犯同样的错了
<8-13,Sheldon>Amy, that action will never be repeated,

243
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,550
<8-13,Sheldon>我保证
<8-13,Sheldon>and that's a promise.

244
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:20,670
<8-13,Sheldon>第三步  诚恳地请求对方原谅
<8-13,Sheldon>Step three-- an earnest request for forgiveness.

245
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,200
<8-13,Sheldon>艾米  求求你原谅我吧
<8-13,Sheldon>Amy, I hope you can forgive me.

246
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,410
<8-13,Sheldon>而且你最好快点原谅
<8-13,Sheldon>And I hope you do it right now,

247
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:24,820
<8-13,Sheldon>因为还有辆优步在楼下等着我呢
<8-13,Sheldon>'cause there's an Uber waiting downstairs,

248
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,350
<8-13,Sheldon>我可不想对着我的司机甘尼什
<8-13,Sheldon>and I don't want to repeat this apology nonsense

249
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:28,770
<8-13,Sheldon>再重复一遍无聊的道歉了
<8-13,Sheldon>with my driver Ganesh.

250
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,260
<8-14,Amy>原谅你了
<8-14,Amy>Fine.

251
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,620
<8-15,Sheldon>多谢了  你真是个好人
<8-15,Sheldon>Oh, thanks! You're a peach!

252
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:34,860
<8-15,Sheldon>贝弗利  回聊啊
<8-15,Sheldon>Beverly, we'll catch up soon.

253
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,180
<8-15,Sheldon>伯纳黛特  回见啊
<8-15,Sheldon>Bernadette, it was a pleasure as always,

254
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,400
<8-15,Sheldon>佩妮  你牙齿上有菠菜
<8-15,Sheldon>Penny, you have spinach in your teeth.

255
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:43,050
<8-16,Penny>这菠菜粘在我牙齿上多久了
<8-16,Penny>How long have I had spinach in my teeth?

256
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:45,330
<8-17,Beverly>在机场时就有了  亲
<8-17,Beverly>Since the airport, dear.

257
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,520
<9-1,Howard>你看起来就像是长了个支架一样
<9-1,Howard>You look like you come with a kickstand.

258
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,280
<9-2,Raj>你的话伤不了我
<9-2,Raj>You can't make me feel bad.

259
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,780
<9-3,Howard>也许我不行  莱纳德你来
<9-3,Howard>Hmm, maybe not. Leonard?

260
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:59,340
<9-4,Leonard>外星人把你送回来时
<9-4,Leonard>So, when the aliens brought you back,

261
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:02,130
<9-4,Leonard>是不是忘记把探测仪拔出来了
<9-4,Leonard>they just left the probe in?

262
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,300
<9-5,Sheldon>我回来了
<9-5,Sheldon>I'm back.

263
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,200
<9-6,Leonard>-怎么样  -完美
<9-6,Leonard>- Hey, how'd it go? - It went well.

264
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,260
<9-7,Sheldon>我发现如果你从来没有道过歉
<9-7,Sheldon>Yeah, I've learned that if you never say you're sorry,

265
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:11,590
<9-7,Sheldon>当你真的道歉时  对方可是会吓到呢
<9-7,Sheldon>the times you do really puts them on their heels.

266
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,970
<9-7,Sheldon>斯图尔特  你可以不用帮我排队了
<9-7,Sheldon>Uh, Stuart, I relieve you of your line duties.

267
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:16,980
<9-8,Stuart>还有人需要我的帮忙吗
<9-8,Stuart>Anyone else need anything before I go?

268
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:20,020
<9-9,Howard>给你一块钱  羞辱一下拉杰
<9-9,Howard>I'll give you a dollar if make fun of Raj.

269
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,050
<9-10,Stuart>-你太坏了  -五块钱
<9-10,Stuart>- That's mean. - Five.

270
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:23,140
<9-12,Stuart>你好像长着尾巴的跳跳虎
<9-12,Stuart>You look like Tigger

271
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,820
<9-12,Stuart>如果跳跳虎和你一样像个智障的话
<9-12,Stuart>if Tigger looked like a jackass.

272
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,800
<9-13,Howard>如果你以后需要推荐人
<9-13,Howard>Uh, if you ever need a reference or anything,

273
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,040
<9-13,Howard>记得找我
<9-13,Howard>just let me know.

274
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,700
<9-14,Man>我来了
<9-14,Man>Hey, guys.

275
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,080
<9-15,Woman>你总算赶到了
<9-15,Woman>You made it.

276
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:36,510
<9-16,Sheldon>你们看见没
<9-16,Sheldon>Did you see that?

277
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:37,920
<9-16,Sheldon>他插队了
<9-16,Sheldon>He just cut the line.

278
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,570
<9-17,Leonard>人家有朋友在排队呢  别管了
<9-17,Leonard>He's just joining his friends; it's fine.

279
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:41,280
<9-18,Sheldon>不  我才不能不管
<9-18,Sheldon>No, it's not fine.

280
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,650
<9-18,Sheldon>这破坏了排队的规则
<9-18,Sheldon>It is a breach of line etiquette.

281
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:45,010
<9-19,Howard>我们差不多排在队伍的最前面了
<9-19,Howard>We're near the front of the line.

282
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:46,390
<9-19,Howard>不管怎样我们都能进去
<9-19,Howard>We'll get in either way.

283
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:48,330
<9-20,Sheldon>如果我们之前的每个人都让人插队呢
<9-20,Sheldon>What if every person in front of us lets someone cut?

284
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:49,200
<9-23,Leonard>我们也能进去
<9-23,Leonard>We'd still get in.

285
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,990
<9-22,Sheldon>如果每个插队的人又让人插队呢
<9-22,Sheldon>What if each of those people let someone cut?

286
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:51,700
<9-23,Leonard>还是能进去
<9-23,Leonard>Still get in.

287
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,300
<9-24,Sheldon>如果后来的人又让人插队呢
<9-24,Sheldon>But then each of those people let someone cut?

288
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,930
<9-25,Leonard>还是能进去  但首先
<9-25,Leonard>We'd still get in, but first I'd hit you

289
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:57,690
<9-25,Leonard>我要用他的手杖椅把你打昏
<9-25,Leonard>over the head with his stick chair.

290
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,050
<9-27,Leonard>-对不起  -求你别说
<9-27,Leonard>- Excuse me. - Oh, please don't.

291
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:03,190
<9-28,Sheldon>我看到
<9-28,Sheldon>Uh, uh, I couldn't help but notice

292
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:04,820
<9-28,Sheldon>你插队了
<9-28,Sheldon>that you cut the line.

293
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,610
<9-29,Man>我朋友在这排着呢
<9-29,Man>Oh, uh, I'm with my friends.

294
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:07,360
<9-29,Man>没事
<9-29,Man>It's cool.

295
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,510
<9-30,Sheldon>才怪
<9-30,Sheldon>Well, no.

296
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:09,970
<9-30,Sheldon>这才不会没事
<9-30,Sheldon>It's not cool.

297
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:12,110
<9-30,Sheldon>如果座位是预定好的
<9-30,Sheldon>If there were reserved seating,

298
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:13,500
<9-30,Sheldon>我们每个人都有票  那就没事
<9-30,Sheldon>and we all had tickets, that would be fine.

299
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,650
<9-30,Sheldon>但这队伍是谁先来谁有座
<9-30,Sheldon>But this line is first-come, first-served.

300
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:18,540
<9-30,Sheldon>而不是"最后一个来  最先一个坐"
<9-30,Sheldon>Not "Show up tardy and nevertheless be first served"

301
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,510
<9-30,Sheldon>来击个掌吧
<9-30,Sheldon>Right here.

302
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:20,890
<9-31,Leonard>不要
<9-31,Leonard>No.

303
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:25,080
<9-32,Sheldon>你得站到队伍最后面去
<9-32,Sheldon>You need to go to the back of the line.

304
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:27,970
<9-33,Man>谁批准你来当排队监督员的
<9-33,Man>Uh, who made you line monitor?

305
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:30,470
<9-34,Sheldon>小学四年级的旺琪老师
<9-34,Sheldon>Mrs. Wunch in fourth grade.

306
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:33,390
<9-34,Sheldon>我的口号是"笔直的队伍
<9-34,Sheldon>And my slogan was "A line that's straight

307
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:35,250
<9-34,Sheldon>才是好队伍"
<9-34,Sheldon>is a line that's great""

308
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:38,470
<9-35,Man>这家伙是认真的吗
<9-35,Man>Is this guy for real?

309
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:41,300
<9-36,Leonard>老兄  我也希望他是在开玩笑
<9-36,Leonard>Boy, I wish I could say no.

310
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:46,150
<10-1,Beverly>谢尔顿愿意道歉  真是很不错
<10-1,Beverly>That was very nice of Sheldon to apologize.

311
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:48,340
<10-2,Amy>他已经进步很多了
<10-2,Amy>Well, he's come a long way.

312
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,750
<10-2,Amy>或者是慢慢进小碎步
<10-2,Amy>Or a short way very slowly,

313
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,280
<10-2,Amy>所以让人错觉已经是很大的进步了
<10-2,Amy>so it feels like a long way.

314
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:56,990
<10-3,Beverly>你和他之间的关系真是太有意思了
<10-3,Beverly>Your relationship with him is fascinating.

315
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:59,790
<10-3,Beverly>我正准备写一本有关那些事业有成的伴侣的书
<10-3,Beverly>I'm preparing to write a book on high-achieving couples,

316
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:01,850
<10-3,Beverly>我很想采访一下你们
<10-3,Beverly>and I would love to interview the both of you.

317
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:03,290
<10-4,Amy>好啊
<10-4,Amy>Oh, sure.

318
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:04,950
<10-4,Amy>我会告诉谢尔顿这事
<10-4,Amy>I'll-I'll talk to Sheldon about it.

319
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,120
<10-4,Amy>伯纳黛特的老公以前还当过宇航员呢
<10-4,Amy>You know, Bernadette's husband is a former astronaut.

320
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,210
<10-4,Amy>真的吗
<10-4,Amy>Really?

321
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:09,590
<10-5,Beverly>你觉得他会对
<10-5,Beverly>Do you think he would be interested

322
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:10,920
<10-5,Beverly>被采访感兴趣吗
<10-5,Beverly>in being interviewed as well?

323
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,880
<10-6,Bernadette>我觉得他会感兴趣吗
<10-6,Bernadette>Do I think he'd be interested?

324
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,820
<10-6,Bernadette>有时候我能听到他独自躲在厕所里
<10-6,Bernadette>Sometimes I hear him pretending to be interviewed

325
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,990
<10-6,Bernadette>假装正在接受采访呢
<10-6,Bernadette>when he's alone in the bathroom.

326
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:18,550
<10-7,Beverly>太好了
<10-7,Beverly>Wonderful!

327
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:21,540
<10-7,Beverly>我会把联系方式留给你
<10-7,Beverly>I'll give you my contact information.

328
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:25,400
<10-8,Bernadette>你也应该和佩妮聊聊啊
<10-8,Bernadette>Um, you should probably talk to Penny, too.

329
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:28,220
<10-9,Beverly>聊什么
<10-9,Beverly>About what?

330
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:30,890
<10-10,Penny>你知道吗
<10-10,Penny>Okay, you know what?

331
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:31,860
<10-10,Penny>你真是太奇葩了
<10-10,Penny>This is ridiculous.

332
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,780
<10-10,Penny>我这一天都努力跟你处好关系
<10-10,Penny>I've been trying to make a connection with you all day,

333
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:36,250
<10-10,Penny>明显都是白费力
<10-10,Penny>and clearly I'm getting nowhere.

334
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,070
<10-11,Beverly>你是在寻求相互有种默契
<10-11,Beverly>Well, are you seeking a connection

335
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:40,510
<10-11,Beverly>还是某种形式的承认
<10-11,Beverly>or just some form of validation?

336
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:42,590
<10-12,Penny>我在寻求的是一点友情
<10-12,Penny>What I was seeking was some sort of friendship.

337
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:45,330
<10-12,Penny>但走到这步  我只求你不当面羞辱我就好
<10-12,Penny>But at this point, I'll take you not insulting me to my face.

338
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:47,640
<10-13,Beverly>我的本意从不是要羞辱你
<10-13,Beverly>My intention was never to insult you.

339
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,890
<10-14,Penny>你今天一整天都是这样
<10-14,Penny>You've been doing it all day!

340
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:51,060
<10-14,Penny>你到底知不知道什么是羞辱
<10-14,Penny>Do you even know what an insult is?!

341
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,980
<10-15,Beverly>虽然不是临床用语
<10-15,Beverly>Well, it's not a clinical term.

342
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,490
<10-15,Beverly>但举个例子  应该是你嫁给我儿子
<10-15,Beverly>But one example would be your marrying my son,

343
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:57,170
<10-15,Beverly>没有邀请也没有告知我
<10-15,Beverly>and not inviting me or even telling me

344
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,750
<10-15,Beverly>要结婚这件事
<10-15,Beverly>the wedding was taking place.

345
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,820
<10-16,Penny>好  这个例子好
<10-16,Penny>Okay, good example.

346
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:10,210
<11-1,Sheldon>乔斯·惠登的作品是如何令你觉得
<11-1,Sheldon>What about Joss Whedon's work makes you think he'd be okay

348
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:12,300
<11-1,Sheldon>破坏规则和插队是没问题的
<11-1,Sheldon>with rule-breakers and line-cutters?!

349
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,650
<11-2,Man>复仇者联盟就是破坏规则者
<11-2,Man>The Avengers are rule-breakers!

350
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:18,030
<11-2,Man>复仇二字就写在职责描述里
<11-2,Man>Being vengeful is in their job description!

351
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,310
<11-3,Sheldon>他们为神盾局工作
<11-3,Sheldon>They work for SHIELD,

352
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:22,610
<11-3,Sheldon>那是受美国政府管理的部门
<11-3,Sheldon>which is a sanctioned department of the U.S. Government!

353
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:25,400
<11-3,Sheldon>你也为受美国政府管理的部门工作吗
<11-3,Sheldon>Do you work for a sanctioned department of the U.S. Government?

354
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,160
<11-4,Man>其实我还真是
<11-4,Man>As a matter of fact I do.

355
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,940
<11-4,Man>在一个小地方叫"车辆管理局"
<11-4,Man>At a little place called the DMV.

356
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:33,080
<11-5,Raj>他说得有道理
<11-5,Raj>He's got him there.

357
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,370
<11-5,Raj>而且跟神盾局一样有"局"字
<11-5,Raj>The D even stands for department.

358
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:37,850
<11-5,Raj>大家注意
<11-5,Raj>Excuse me!

359
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:40,120
<11-6,Sheldon>大家看这里  能不能举手表态
<11-6,Sheldon>Excuse me, can I please see a show of hands?

360
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,810
<11-6,Sheldon>认为此人插队行为有问题的请举手
<11-6,Sheldon>Who here takes issue with this person cutting the line?

361
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:46,880
<11-7,Man>我就说吧
<11-7,Man>Told you.

362
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,020
<11-8,Sheldon>多么悲哀的世道啊
<11-8,Sheldon>Well, what a sad state of affairs!

363
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:52,070
<11-8,Sheldon>你们都被生活打击到
<11-8,Sheldon>That you've all been so ground down by life,

364
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:54,240
<11-8,Sheldon>连有人不尊重你们都毫无知觉
<11-8,Sheldon>you don't even notice when someone disrespects you.

365
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,720
<11-9,Howard>不敢相信我们即将被揍的原因
<11-9,Howard>I can't believe we're gonna get beat up,

366
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,390
<11-9,Howard>居然不是因为你的手杖椅
<11-9,Howard>and it's not because of your chair.

367
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:01,440
<11-10,Sheldon>可知道就在现在  队伍的后面
<11-10,Sheldon>You know, right now, at the back of this line,

368
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,350
<11-10,Sheldon>有一个和你一样的影迷
<11-10,Sheldon>there's a movie fan like you

369
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,580
<11-10,Sheldon>即将无法进入影厅
<11-10,Sheldon>who's not going to get in,

370
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:07,290
<11-10,Sheldon>就是因为这个人的不在乎
<11-10,Sheldon>because this person simply doesn't care.

371
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:08,860
<11-10,Sheldon>没错  在61年前的队伍里
<11-10,Sheldon>Yeah, well, 61 years ago,

372
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,700
<11-10,Sheldon>后面也站着一个人
<11-10,Sheldon>there was another person at the back of the line

373
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:15,400
<11-10,Sheldon>美国五六十年代的女性黑人民权运动者
<11-10,Sheldon>因为拒绝公车司机要求黑人给白人让座的要求而被捕

374
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:15,400
<11-10,Sheldon>她的名字就叫罗莎·帕克斯
<11-10,Sheldon>and her name was Rosa Parks.

375
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,970
<11-11,Leonard>听着  你一会儿可能要装成黑人
<11-11,Leonard>Okay, you may have to pretend you're black

376
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:20,940
<11-11,Leonard>帮我们逃过这一劫
<11-11,Leonard>to get us out of here.

377
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:24,430
<11-12,Sheldon>现在让我们跟随那位勇敢女性的脚步
<11-12,Sheldon>Now, let's follow in that brave woman's footsteps,

378
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:26,480
<11-12,Sheldon>为我们自己站出来吧
<11-12,Sheldon>and stand up for ourselves!

379
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,350
<11-12,Sheldon>我知道她是为了能坐下而"站起来"的
<11-12,Sheldon>And-and I realize that she stood up by remaining seated,

380
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:31,200
<11-12,Sheldon>但现在不是享受这份讽刺感的时候
<11-12,Sheldon>but now is not that time to enjoy the irony of that.

381
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,940
<11-12,Sheldon>现在我再问一遍
<11-12,Sheldon>Now, I ask you again.

382
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,710
<11-13,Woman>如果你觉得这个人...
<11-13,Woman>Who here takes issue with this person--?

383
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:37,580
<11-13,Woman>我们为什么要听你讲话  你也是一个插队的
<11-13,Woman>Why should we listen to you? You cut the line yourself.

384
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,680
<11-14,Sheldon>我确定一定以及肯定没有
<11-14,Sheldon>I most certainly did not.

385
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,950
<11-15,Woman>我亲眼看到的
<11-15,Woman>I saw you.

386
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:43,890
<11-16,Man>如果你觉得头晕
<11-16,Man>If you're feeling dizzy,

387
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:46,910
<11-16,Man>那是因为风水轮流转
<11-16,Man>it's because the tables have turned.

388
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:51,830
<11-17,Sheldon>你听好  我是付钱请人替我排队
<11-17,Sheldon>Excuse me, I paid someone to wait in line for me,

389
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:53,100
<11-17,Sheldon>等我到达以后  他就走了
<11-17,Sheldon>and then when I arrived, he left,

390
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,190
<11-17,Sheldon>所以你这女子亲眼所见的
<11-17,Sheldon>so what you saw, my good woman,

391
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:57,610
<11-17,Sheldon>叫"换"人  不叫"插"队
<11-17,Sheldon>was "swapsies" not "cutsies"

392
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:58,740
<11-17,Sheldon>不行不行  等等
<11-17,Sheldon>Oh, no, no, no, no, wait!

393
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,060
<11-17,Sheldon>我再问一遍  请举手
<11-17,Sheldon>I ask you all again. A show of hands.

394
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,150
<11-17,Sheldon>谁对这个人...  别走了
<11-17,Sheldon>Who here takes issue--? Well, stop moving!

395
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:02,960
<11-17,Sheldon>他就要进去了
<11-17,Sheldon>He's gonna get in!

396
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,320
<11-18,Leonard>-兄弟  随他吧  -不行  我做不到
<11-18,Leonard>- Buddy, let it go. - No, I can't.

397
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,260
<11-19,Sheldon>这样不对
<11-19,Sheldon>This isn't right.

398
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,290
<11-20,Leonard>你已经尽力了
<11-20,Leonard>You did everything you could.

399
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:08,180
<11-21,Sheldon>不  我还能更努力
<11-21,Sheldon>No, I could've done more.

400
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:11,650
<11-22,Leonard>乖啦  你把我们对伟大人权运动先驱的
<11-22,Leonard>Now, now, you denigrated the memory

401
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:13,280
<11-22,Leonard>美好记忆都摧毁了
<11-22,Leonard>of a great civil rights pioneer.

402
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,550
<11-22,Leonard>你做的已经够多了
<11-22,Leonard>That's all anyone could ask.

403
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:21,980
<12-1,Penny>老实说  我没有想到你居然会在乎那场婚礼
<12-1,Penny>To be honest, I'm surprised you cared about the wedding at all.

404
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,070
<12-2,Beverly>我也是个人  佩妮
<12-2,Beverly>I'm still human, Penny.

405
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:26,180
<12-2,Beverly>自己儿子的婚礼不被邀请
<12-2,Beverly>Not getting invited to my own son's wedding

406
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:28,140
<12-2,Beverly>很难不在意
<12-2,Beverly>is difficult to ignore.

407
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,430
<12-3,Amy>我懂你的感受
<12-3,Amy>I know how you feel.

408
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:30,660
<12-3,Amy>她也没有邀请我们
<12-3,Amy>She didn't invite any of us.

409
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,290
<12-4,Penny>那是一时冲动下去结的
<12-4,Penny>It was spur of the moment!

410
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:35,550
<12-5,Bernadette>但我们有在网上看直播
<12-5,Bernadette>But we did get to see a live stream of it on the Internet.

411
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:38,400
<12-6,Beverly>我也可以看网上直播啊
<12-6,Beverly>I could've watched it on the Internet?

412
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:42,260
<12-6,Beverly>谢你啊
<12-6,Beverly>Thank you.

413
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,320
<12-7,Penny>所以如果我们邀请你去拉斯维加斯
<12-7,Penny>So if we would have asked you to come to Vegas

414
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,890
<12-7,Penny>参加我们的婚礼  你会来的吗
<12-7,Penny>to see us get married, you would've come?

415
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:51,530
<12-8,Beverly>不会  我会说你们犯了滔天大错
<12-8,Beverly>No, I would've said you're making a huge mistake.

416
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:54,730
<12-8,Beverly>但邀请一下也算礼数做到了啊
<12-8,Beverly>But an invitation would've been nice.

417
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,170
<12-9,Penny>你真觉得我们是错误吗
<12-9,Penny>You really think we made a mistake?

418
00:16:58,170 --> 00:16:59,480
<12-10,Beverly>当时我是那么认为的
<12-10,Beverly>At the time I did.

419
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,220
<12-10,Beverly>但我从来没见过莱纳德那么开心
<12-10,Beverly>But I-I've never seen Leonard so happy,

420
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:05,600
<12-10,Beverly>所以  也许是我错了
<12-10,Beverly>so... perhaps I was wrong.

421
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:08,940
<12-10,Beverly>好吧
<12-10,Beverly>Okay.

422
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:11,180
<12-11,Penny>那这样吧
<12-11,Penny>Well, um, how about this?

423
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,660
<12-11,Penny>趁着你还在城里
<12-11,Penny>Maybe while you're still in town,

424
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:16,090
<12-11,Penny>我跟莱纳德再办一次小仪式
<12-11,Penny>Leonard and I could have another small ceremony.

425
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:18,760
<12-11,Penny>如果你想参加的话
<12-11,Penny>You know, if you're interested.

426
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,430
<12-12,Beverly>我完全可以接受
<12-12,Beverly>I would find that perfectly acceptable.

427
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:24,370
<12-13,Penny>她说完全可以接受
<12-13,Penny>She would find it perfectly acceptable!

428
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:26,890
<12-13,Penny>你们看到了吧  我们婆媳情深
<12-13,Penny>You guys saw it! We bonded!

429
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,330
<13-1,Bernadette>华仔  你没事吧
<13-1,Bernadette>Howie? You doing okay?

430
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:38,970
<13-1,Bernadette>你已经在里面待很久了
<13-1,Bernadette>You've been in there a while.

431
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:41,240
<13-2,Howard (through bathroom door)>没事  马上出去
<13-2,Howard (through bathroom door)>I'm fine. Be right out.

432
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:45,400
<13-2,Howard (through bathroom door)>我算不算美国英雄
<13-2,Howard (through bathroom door)>Am I an American hero?

433
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,430
<13-2,Howard (through bathroom door)>真是个好问题  吉姆
<13-2,Howard (through bathroom door)>Well, that's a good question, Jim.

434
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:54,460
<13-2,Howard (through bathroom door)>你不觉得一位宇航员一旦离开了地球
<13-2,Howard (through bathroom door)>Don't you think once an astronaut leaves the planet,

435
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:58,640
<13-2,Howard (through bathroom door)>就成为世界英雄了吗
<13-2,Howard (through bathroom door)>he's a hero to all the nations of the Earth?

436
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:02,690
<13-2,Howard (through bathroom door)>好的
<13-2,Howard (through bathroom door)>Okey dokey.

437
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:05,730
<13-2,Howard (through bathroom door)>我应该还有空回答最后一道问题
<13-2,Howard (through bathroom door)>I think I have time for one more question.
