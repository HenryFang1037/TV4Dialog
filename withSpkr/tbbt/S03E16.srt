00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,370
<2-48,Penny>然后他们逼问我"除了你还有谁"
<2-48,Penny>and they were all, "If it wasn't you, who was it?"

119
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,400
<2-49,Sheldon>于是你就把我出卖了
<2-49,Sheldon>So you betrayed me?

120
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:03,570
<2-49,Sheldon>才没有
<2-49,Sheldon>No!

121
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,030
<2-50,Penny>这哪是出卖
<2-50,Penny>It wasn't a betrayal.

122
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,730
<2-50,Penny>我只不过表示"我的驾照已经没分好扣了"
<2-50,Penny>It was more of a "I can't afford any more points on my license."

123
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,070
<2-50,Penny>我已经不得不
<2-50,Penny>I already have to buy my insurance

124
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,530
<2-50,Penny>去开曼群岛上买车险了
<2-50,Penny>from this place in the Cayman Islands.

125
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:14,070
<2-51,Sheldon>但我之所以开你的车还不是因为
<2-51,Sheldon>But the only reason I was driving your car

126
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,880
<2-51,Sheldon>你当时可怜兮兮的我才伸出援手
<2-51,Sheldon>was because you were in distress and I was rescuing you.

127
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,780
<2-52,Penny>你有张照片记录英勇的一天
<2-52,Penny>Yes,you have a photo to remember that heroic day.

128
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:24,010
<2-53,Leonard>没什么大不了的
<2-53,Leonard>It's not that big a deal.

129
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,240
<2-53,Leonard>你只要周四去法院
<2-53,Leonard>You just go down to the court on Thursday

130
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,440
<2-53,Leonard>交罚金就行
<2-53,Leonard>and you pay the fine.

131
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:29,280
<2-54,Sheldon>我才不去交罚金
<2-54,Sheldon>I'm not going to pay a fine.

132
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:30,680
<2-54,Sheldon>那就说明我有罪
<2-54,Sheldon>That would imply I'm guilty.

133
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:33,240
<2-55,Howard>你确实有罪
<2-55,Howard>You are guilty.

135
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:40,090
<2-55,Howard>这个我喜欢
<2-55,Howard>That one I liked.

136
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:43,040
<2-56,Sheldon>我是无罪的
<2-56,Sheldon>I am not guilty.

137
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:44,340
<2-56,Sheldon>我只有实习驾照
<2-56,Sheldon>I only have a learner's permit.

138
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:45,780
<2-56,Sheldon>佩妮教我的
<2-56,Sheldon>Penny was the teacher.

139
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:47,710
<2-56,Sheldon>转黄灯时  她就说"快快快"
<2-56,Sheldon>When the light turned yellow she said "Go, go, go."

140
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,410
<2-56,Sheldon>于是我就"开开开"
<2-56,Sheldon>So I went, went, went.

141
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,540
<2-56,Sheldon>谢尔顿  对不起
<2-56,Sheldon>Sheldon, I'm sorry.

142
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:53,440
<2-57,Penny>我会还你罚金的钱
<2-57,Penny>I'll be happy to reimburse you for the fine.

143
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:57,280
<2-57,Penny>只要我能参演一部电影 或者自己拍个电视剧
<2-57,Penny>You know, as soon as I get a part in a movie or my own TV series.

144
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:59,710
<2-58,Sheldon>不用你还  因为我不会交的
<2-58,Sheldon>You don't need to reimburse me because I'm not paying.

145
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,780
<2-58,Sheldon>周四那天  我会去法院 正义会得到伸张
<2-58,Sheldon>On Thursday, I will have my day in court and justice will be done.

146
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:07,290
<2-58,Sheldon>我现在就着手准备辩护
<2-58,Sheldon>In fact, I'm going to begin preparing my defense right now.

147
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:11,080
<2-59,Howard>他坐定牢了
<2-59,Howard>Okay, he's going to jail.

148
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:15,890
<2-60,Leonard (after Raj whispers to him)>对哦 周四是斯坦·李签名日
<2-60,Leonard (after Raj whispers to him)>Oh, that's right. Thursday is Stan Lee Day.

149
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,890
<2-61,Sheldon>看到你做的好事了吧
<2-61,Sheldon>Now you see what you've done?

150
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:24,350
<2-61,Sheldon>就因为你  我们都见不到斯坦·李了
<2-61,Sheldon>Because of you, we're all going to miss Stan Lee.

151
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,780
<2-62,Leonard>你说"都"是什么意思
<2-62,Leonard>What do you mean "all?"

152
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:30,610
<2-63,Sheldon>你们是我朋友啊
<2-63,Sheldon>Well, you're my friends.

153
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:34,610
<2-63,Sheldon>你们要站在我旁边  支持我 为我提供案例
<2-63,Sheldon>You'll be standing by my side, supporting me, feeding me legal precedents,

154
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,280
<2-63,Sheldon>你们上身要是够壮
<2-63,Sheldon>and if you had the upper body strength,

155
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:39,950
<2-63,Sheldon>我胜诉时  可以把我搁肩膀上扛出去
<2-63,Sheldon>carrying me out on your shoulders when I'm victorious.

156
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:42,910
<2-64,Leonard>这个嘛  不行
<2-64,Leonard>Yeah, okay. No.

157
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,980
<2-65,Sheldon>你是说我为自己辩护时
<2-65,Sheldon>Are you saying that you will not stand beside me

158
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,440
<2-65,Sheldon>你不会来站在我身边吗
<2-65,Sheldon>as I plead my case?

159
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:48,480
<2-66,Leonard>是这个意思
<2-66,Leonard>That's what I'm saying.

160
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:50,390
<2-67,Sheldon>霍华德
<2-67,Sheldon>Howard?

161
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,940
<2-68,Howard>斯坦·李  法庭上的你
<2-68,Howard>Uh, Stan Lee, or you in court.

162
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:56,010
<2-68,Howard>要是《苏菲的选择》有这么简单
<2-68,Howard>Uh, if this was Sophie's Choice

163
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:58,010
<2-68,Howard>电影就不会那么长了  不行
<2-68,Howard>it would've been a much shorter movie. No.

164
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:01,750
<2-69,Sheldon>拉杰 你会来吧
<2-69,Sheldon>Raj? You'll be there, won't you?

165
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:08,910
<2-69,Sheldon>那好吧 我所谓的朋友都抛弃了我
<2-69,Sheldon>All right, then. My so-called friends have forsaken me.

166
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:12,340
<2-69,Sheldon>看来只剩我和目击证人了
<2-69,Sheldon>So, I guess it'll just be me and my eyewitness.

167
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:15,840
<2-70,Penny>晕死
<2-70,Penny>Oh, balls.

168
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:17,080
<2-71,Sheldon>请着装得体一点
<2-71,Sheldon>Please try to wear something appropriate.

169
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:18,610
<2-71,Sheldon>要是法官只顾着想
<2-71,Sheldon>It won't help my case

170
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,310
<2-71,Sheldon>你屁股上'美味多汁'的意思
<2-71,Sheldon>if the judge is busy trying to read the word "Juicy"

171
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,350
<2-71,Sheldon>对我的案子没好处
<2-71,Sheldon>scrawled across your buttocks.

172
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,780
<3-1,Sheldon>佩妮
<3-1,Sheldon>Penny.

173
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:31,140
<3-1,Sheldon>佩妮
<3-1,Sheldon>Penny.

174
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:33,650
<3-1,Sheldon>佩妮
<3-1,Sheldon>Penny.

175
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:36,610
<3-3,Sheldon>节奏不对
<3-3,Sheldon>That's just wrong.

176
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,340
<3-4,Penny>好了  走吧
<3-4,Penny>All right, let's go.

177
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:41,080
<3-5,Sheldon>等一下 去法院之前
<3-5,Sheldon>Wait, hold on. Before we get to the courthouse,

178
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:44,040
<3-5,Sheldon>我想看一下你的演技
<3-5,Sheldon>I'd like to call on your skills as an actress.

179
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:45,340
<3-6,Penny>这是什么
<3-6,Penny>What is this?

180
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:46,510
<3-7,Sheldon>我冒昧地
<3-7,Sheldon>I've taken the liberty

181
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,480
<3-7,Sheldon>为你起草了出庭作证的剧本
<3-7,Sheldon>of scripting your appearance on the witness stand

182
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:50,880
<3-7,Sheldon>面对现实  你有点我行我素
<3-7,Sheldon>because, let's face it, you're somewhat of a loose cannon.

183
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:53,340
<3-7,Sheldon>别担心  都是用你的方言写的
<3-7,Sheldon>Now, don't worry; it's written in your vernacular.

184
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,810
<3-7,Sheldon>我们排练一下如何
<3-7,Sheldon>So shall we rehearse?

185
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,980
<3-8,Penny>我有得选吗
<3-8,Penny>Do I have a choice?

186
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:57,640
<3-9,Sheldon>你当然有选择权
<3-9,Sheldon>Well, of course you have a choice.

187
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:00,140
<3-9,Sheldon>虽然我们生活在宿命里
<3-9,Sheldon>Although we live in a deterministic universe,

188
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,580
<3-9,Sheldon>但每个人都有自由选择的权力
<3-9,Sheldon>each individual has free will.

189
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:03,610
<3-9,Sheldon>给我坐下
<3-9,Sheldon>Now, sit down.

190
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:08,410
<3-9,Sheldon>请你回忆下 11月16日发生的事
<3-9,Sheldon>I call your attention to the events of November 16.

191
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,880
<3-9,Sheldon>你记得那天吗
<3-9,Sheldon>Do you remember that date?

192
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:13,850
<3-10,Penny (reading)>废话  我记得
<3-10,Penny (reading)>"Darn tootin', I do.

193
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,110
<3-10,Penny (reading)>请法官原谅我家乡内布拉斯加
<3-10,Penny (reading)>"If the court will excuse my homespun,

194
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,840
<3-10,Penny (reading)>粗俗简朴的语言
<3-10,Penny (reading)>corn-fed Nebraskan turn of phrase."

195
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,010
<3-11,Sheldon>很好  继续
<3-11,Sheldon>Excellent. Go on.

196
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,540
<3-12,Penny>我记得那天
<3-12,Penny>"The reason that date is, like,

197
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:27,080
<3-12,Penny>而且铭记在我的脑子里
<3-12,Penny>"so totally fixed in my memory

198
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:28,910
<3-12,Penny>是因为我有幸目睹了
<3-12,Penny>"is that I had the privilege to be witness

199
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:32,950
<3-12,Penny>毕生从未见过的英勇行为
<3-12,Penny>to one of the most heroic acts I've ever seen in, like, ever."

200
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:37,610
<3-13,Sheldon>谁的英勇行为
<3-13,Sheldon>"And who performed that heroic act?"

201
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,280
<3-14,Penny>您的啊  阁下
<3-14,Penny>"Why, you did, sir.

202
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:41,610
<3-14,Penny>您  谢尔顿·库珀博士
<3-14,Penny>"You. Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

203
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:45,120
<3-14,Penny>而且我想说  我很荣幸认识您
<3-14,Penny>And may I add, it is a privilege to know you."

204
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,810
<3-15,Sheldon>不必称赞我
<3-15,Sheldon>"There's no need for compliments.

205
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,840
<3-15,Sheldon>法庭只看重事实
<3-15,Sheldon>This court is only interested in the facts."

206
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:53,640
<3-17,Sheldon>但感觉很荣幸能认识您啊也是个事实啊
<3-17,Sheldon>"But it is a fact that it's a privilege to know you.

207
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:56,150
<3-18,Penny (pretending to be close to tears)>真的
<3-18,Penny (pretending to be close to tears)>Totally."

208
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:00,510
<3-16,Penny>一滴泪从我面颊流下
<3-16,Penny>A teardrop rolls down my cheek?!

209
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,010
<3-17,Sheldon>纯属建议
<3-17,Sheldon>Only a suggestion.

210
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,950
<3-17,Sheldon>喉咙哽咽一下也可以
<3-17,Sheldon>A catch in your throat would work just as well.

211
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:08,510
<3-18,Penny (pretending to be close to tears)>但我感觉
<3-18,Penny (pretending to be close to tears)>"But it is a fact

212
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,140
<3-18,Penny (pretending to be close to tears)>很荣幸能认识您啊也是个事实啊
<3-18,Penny (pretending to be close to tears)>"that it's a privilege to know you.

213
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:13,650
<3-18,Penny (pretending to be close to tears)>真的
<3-18,Penny (pretending to be close to tears)>Totally."

214
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,850
<3-19,Sheldon>你还是穿"美味多汁"的裤子吧
<3-19,Sheldon>Maybe you should put on your "Juicy" pants again.

215
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,510
<3-19,Sheldon>去交罚金
<3-19,Sheldon>Pay the cashier.

216
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,790
<4-1,Judge>谢尔顿·库珀
<4-1,Judge>Sheldon Cooper.

217
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,640
<4-2,Sheldon>早上好  法官大人
<4-2,Sheldon>Good morning, Your Honor.

218
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:34,010
<4-2,Sheldon>我是谢尔顿·库珀博士 自我辩护
<4-2,Sheldon>Dr. Sheldon Cooper appearing in pro se.

219
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:36,210
<4-2,Sheldon>也就是说  代表我自己
<4-2,Sheldon>That is to say, representing himself.

220
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,610
<4-3,Judge>我知道什么意思
<4-3,Judge>I know what it means.

221
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:38,980
<4-3,Judge>我读过法律学校
<4-3,Judge>I went to law school.

222
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:41,920
<4-4,Sheldon>结果却在审理交通法庭
<4-4,Sheldon>And yet you wound up in traffic court.

223
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:44,210
<4-4,Sheldon>不管怎样
<4-4,Sheldon>Anyway,

224
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,680
<4-4,Sheldon>法官允许的话
<4-4,Sheldon>if it would please the court,

225
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:47,010
<4-4,Sheldon>我想做个开庭陈述
<4-4,Sheldon>I'd like to begin with an opening statement.

226
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:49,740
<4-5,Judge>法官会建议你简短点
<4-5,Judge>The court would advise you to make it quick,

227
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,480
<4-5,Judge>因为法官早上吃了可能馊了的玉米煎饼
<4-5,Judge>as the court had a dicey-looking breakfast burrito this morning

228
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:54,720
<4-5,Judge>而且刚吃了易蒙停(止泻药)
<4-5,Judge>and just took an Imodium.

229
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,780
<4-5,Judge>快速的开场陈述
<4-5,Judge>A quick opening statement.

230
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:03,740
<4-6,Sheldon>如同一个挤奶凳 本案有三个 立足点
<4-6,Sheldon>Like a milking stool, my case rests on three legs.

231
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,210
<4-6,Sheldon>我要论证的是
<4-6,Sheldon>I will demonstrate

232
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,040
<4-6,Sheldon>我在驾驶过程中  受到一个女人的误导
<4-6,Sheldon>that I was improperly instructed in driving

233
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:09,410
<4-6,Sheldon>这个女人缺乏社会上
<4-6,Sheldon>by a woman whose lack of respect for society

234
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,840
<4-6,Sheldon>对反社会界定的基本认识

<4-6,Sheldon>紧急情况下的法律原理
<4-6,Sheldon>that the emergency met the legal doctrine

237
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,310
<4-6,Sheldon>是需要即合法[拉丁文]
<4-6,Sheldon>of quod est necessarium est licitum--

238
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,510
<4-6,Sheldon>也就是需要即合法

<4-6,Sheldon>I'm unable to confront my accuser,

242
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:27,140
<4-6,Sheldon>因为控方是一台非人类机器

243
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,510
<4-6,Sheldon>也就是摄像机
