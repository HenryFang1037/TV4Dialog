1
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,190
<1-1,Penny>每次看到格林奇的心脏[出自影片《圣诞怪杰》]
<1-1,Penny>Oh, I always tear up

2
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,420
<1-1,Penny>涨大三倍的时候  我都止不住要流泪
<1-1,Penny>When the Grinch's heart grows three sizes.

3
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:12,450
<1-2,Sheldon>流泪是应该的
<1-2,Sheldon>Tears seem appropriate.

4
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,120
<1-2,Sheldon>心肌的扩张
<1-2,Sheldon>Enlargement of the heart muscle,

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,490
<1-2,Sheldon>或是肥大型心肌病  都是重病
<1-2,Sheldon>Or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, is a serious disease

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,550
<1-2,Sheldon>会引起充血性心力衰竭
<1-2,Sheldon>which could lead to congestive heart failure.

7
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,090
<1-4,Penny>你不喜欢他是吧  谢尔顿
<1-4,Penny>You really didn't like it, Sheldon?

8
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,590
<1-5,Sheldon>不  正相反
<1-5,Sheldon>No, on the contrary.

9
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:31,090
<1-5,Sheldon>我认为格林奇是个体贴又迷人的角色
<1-5,Sheldon>I found the Grinch to be a relatable,engaging character.

10
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:33,750
<1-5,Sheldon>而且我十分赞赏
<1-5,Sheldon>And I was really with him right up to the point

11
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,450
<1-5,Sheldon>他屈从于社会习俗
<1-5,Sheldon>that he succumbed to social convention

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,450
<1-5,Sheldon>回赠礼物  拯救了圣诞节的行为
<1-5,Sheldon>And returned the presents and saved Christmas.

13
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,590
<1-5,Sheldon>多么扫兴啊
<1-5,Sheldon>What a buzz kill that was.

14
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:45,450
<1-6,Leonard>我们看《圣诞雪人》的时候  他赞成出太阳
<1-6,Leonard>When we watch Frosty the Snowman, he roots for the sun.

15
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,090
<1-6,Leonard>请注意
<1-6,Leonard>Excuse me,

16
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:49,850
<1-7,Sheldon>太阳是万物之必需
<1-7,Sheldon>But the sun is essential for all life on Earth.

17
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,220
<1-7,Sheldon>而圣诞雪人只是一个
<1-7,Sheldon>Frosty is merely

18
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:55,620
<1-7,Sheldon>冰雪构成的怪物  瞬息即逝  还戴着偷来的帽子
<1-7,Sheldon>A bit of frozen supernatural ephemera in a stolen hat.

19
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:58,720
<1-7,Sheldon>那是犯罪  而且居然从没有人为此指责他
<1-7,Sheldon>A crime, by the way, for which he is never brought to account.

20
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,800
<1-7,Sheldon>生活大爆炸
<1-7,Sheldon>第三季第十一集

21
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,430
<2-1,Penny>我超爱装饰圣诞树
<2-1,Penny>I just love decorating the Christmas tree.

22
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,300
<2-1,Penny>感觉自己又回到了小时候
<2-1,Penny>It makes me feel like a little girl again.

23
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,530
<2-2,Leonard>我小时候家里没有圣诞树
<2-2,Leonard>We didn't have a tree when I was growing up.

24
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,060
<2-3,Penny>真的吗  为什么
<2-3,Penny>Really? Why not?

25
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,900
<2-4,Leonard>在我家
<2-4,Leonard>Mmm, in my family,

26
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,230
<2-4,Leonard>节日通常是用来研究人类社会中
<2-4,Leonard>Holidays weren't so much celebrated as studied

27
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,730
<2-4,Leonard>它们起到的人类学和心理学意义
<2-4,Leonard>For their anthropological and psychological implications

28
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,060
<2-4,Leonard>而不是用来庆祝的
<2-4,Leonard>On human society.

29
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:47,060
<2-5,Penny>真有节日气氛
<2-5,Penny>Oh, sounds festive.

30
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:48,700
<2-5,Penny>那你们总会互赠礼物吧
<2-5,Penny>Did you at least give presents?

31
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,460
<2-6,Leonard>某种程度上
<2-6,Leonard>Mmm, in a way.

32
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:52,530
<2-6,Leonard>我们互赠研究论文
<2-6,Leonard>We presented papers.

33
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,230
<2-6,Leonard>然后分小组讨论  再相互评论
<2-6,Leonard>And then broke off into focus groups and critiqued each other.

34
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,460
<2-7,Penny>谢尔顿  你呢
<2-7,Penny>Sheldon, what about you?

35
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:00,900
<2-7,Penny>你家有圣诞树吗
<2-7,Penny>Did you have a Christmas tree?

36
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,230
<2-7,Penny>当然有
<2-7,Penny>Oh, yes.

37
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,760
<2-8,Sheldon>有圣诞树  有马槽
<2-8,Sheldon>We had a tree, we had a manger,

38
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:07,430
<2-8,Sheldon>草坪上还有一个充气圣诞老人
<2-8,Sheldon>We had an inflatable Santa Claus

39
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,760
<2-8,Sheldon>身前站着一只塑料驯鹿
<2-8,Sheldon>with plastic reindeer on the front lawn.

40
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,350
<2-8,Sheldon>为了增添欢乐气氛
<2-8,Sheldon>And to make things even more jolly,

41
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,700
<2-8,Sheldon>房子的周围还有一闪一闪的灯光
<2-8,Sheldon>there were so many blinking lights on the house

42
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,360
<2-8,Sheldon>引得周围邻居纷纷来偷
<2-8,Sheldon>They induced neighborhood-wide seizures.

43
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:19,260
<2-9,Penny>所以我猜你不想帮我们装饰圣诞树咯
<2-9,Penny>So I take it you don't want to help us trim the tree.

44
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:20,460
<2-9,Penny>不想
<2-9,Penny>I do not.

45
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:21,960
<2-10,Sheldon>但如果你坚持
<2-10,Sheldon>But if you insist

46
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:25,430
<2-10,Sheldon>把一个爬满蜘蛛的的易燃物放在我家
<2-10,Sheldon>on decorating a spider-infested fire hazard in my home

47
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,930
<2-10,Sheldon>我要求你把这个加上
<2-10,Sheldon>I would request that you add this.

48
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,260
<2-11,Penny>那是什么
<2-11,Penny>What is it?

49
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:31,930
<2-12,Sheldon>你是在开玩笑吗
<2-12,Sheldon>You're kidding, right?

50
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,900
<2-12,Sheldon>这是牛顿爵士的半身像
<2-12,Sheldon>It's a bust of Sir Isaac Newton.

51
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:37,160
<2-13,Penny>没错  是的
<2-13,Penny>Oh, sure, sure.

52
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,430
<2-13,Penny>很有圣诞气息
<2-13,Penny>Very Christmasy.

53
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,360
<2-14,Sheldon>不  应该是比你挂在那棵树上的
<2-14,Sheldon>Wait, excuse me, but it's much

54
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:42,930
<2-14,Sheldon>其他东西都更有圣诞气息
<2-14,Sheldon>more "Christmasy" than anything you've put on the tree.

55
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,930
<2-15,Leonard>又开始了
<2-15,Leonard>Here we go.

56
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,430
<2-16,Sheldon>公历1642年12月25日
<2-16,Sheldon>December 25, 1642,Julian calendar,

57
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,030
<2-16,Sheldon>艾萨克·牛顿爵士诞生
<2-16,Sheldon>Sir Isaac Newton is born.

58
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,100
<2-16,Sheldon>而另一方面  耶稣其实夏天出生的
<2-16,Sheldon>Jesus, on the other hand, was actually born in the summer

59
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,030
<2-16,Sheldon>他的生日被改到了
<2-16,Sheldon>His birthday was moved

60
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,030
<2-16,Sheldon>和异教徒某个传统节日的同一天
<2-16,Sheldon>to coincide with a traditional pagan holiday

61
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,860
<2-16,Sheldon>那一天本该要点起篝火
<2-16,Sheldon>that celebrated the winter solstice

62
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,630
<2-16,Sheldon>屠宰山羊  庆祝冬至
<2-16,Sheldon>with lit fires and slaughtered goats.

63
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,260
<2-16,Sheldon>老实说
<2-16,Sheldon>Which, frankly,

64
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:03,730
<2-16,Sheldon>那会比和我妈妈在教堂待上12小时
<2-16,Sheldon>sounds like more fun than 12 hours of church with my mother

65
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,230
<2-16,Sheldon>然后回来吃水果蛋糕要有趣得多
<2-16,Sheldon>followed by a fruitcake.

66
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,860
<2-17,Leonard>祝大家"牛诞快乐"
<2-17,Leonard>Merry Newton-mas, everyone.

67
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:11,860
<2-18,Sheldon>虽然说不上原因  但我觉得你这祝福并不真诚
<2-18,Sheldon>I sense that's not sincere, although I have no idea why.

68
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:14,700
<2-19,Penny>没事的  牛顿爵士可以
<2-19,Penny>No, it's fine. Look, Sir Issac can go

69
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,130
<2-19,Penny>跟这个拐杖糖挂在一起
<2-19,Penny>right next to this little candy cane.

70
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,960
<2-20,Sheldon>不行  牛顿要放在树的顶端
<2-20,Sheldon>No. Isaac goes at the top of the tree.

71
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,730
<2-21,Leonard>不  不行
<2-21,Leonard>No, he doesn't.

72
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,160
<2-22,Sheldon>我明白
<2-22,Sheldon>I understand.

73
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:24,860
<2-22,Sheldon>你是因为牛顿声称  是他发明了微积分而抵触他
<2-22,Sheldon>You dispute Newton's claim that he invented calculus

74
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:27,900
<2-22,Sheldon>你想要把莱布尼茨[德数学家]挂在树顶
<2-22,Sheldon>and you want to put Gottfried Leibniz on the top.

75
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,100
<2-23,Leonard>没错  被你发现了
<2-23,Leonard>Yeah, you got me.

76
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,430
<2-23,Leonard>我支持莱布尼茨
<2-23,Leonard>I'm a Leibniz man.

77
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,260
<2-24,Sheldon>也许等你妈妈来了之后
<2-24,Sheldon>Well, perhaps when your mother gets here,

78
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:33,800
<2-24,Sheldon>她能启发你清醒一点
<2-24,Sheldon>she'll talk some sense into you.

79
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,000
<2-24,Sheldon>什么
<2-24,Sheldon>What?

80
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,600
<2-25,Penny>你妈妈要来  什么时候
<2-25,Penny>Your-your mother's coming? When?

81
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,600
<2-26,Leonard>明天
<2-26,Leonard>Tomorrow.

82
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,360
<2-27,Penny>那你打算什么时候告诉我
<2-27,Penny>When were you going to tell me?

83
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,530
<2-28,Leonard>明天吧
<2-28,Leonard>Um... tomorrow?

84
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,130
<2-29,Penny>你为什么要对我保密
<2-29,Penny>Why were you keeping this a secret?

85
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,360
<2-30,Leonard>我只是  只是想
<2-30,Leonard>Well, I just-- I thought...

86
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:47,200
<2-31,Sheldon>我能打断一下吗
<2-31,Sheldon>If I can interject here,

87
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,030
<2-31,Sheldon>很显然  莱纳德是担心
<2-31,Sheldon>Obviously Leonard is concerned

88
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,430
<2-31,Sheldon>怕他妈妈不会赞成你做他的伴侣
<2-31,Sheldon>that his mother won't approve of you as his mate.

89
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,260
<2-32,Penny>为什么她会不赞成
<2-32,Penny>Why wouldn't she approve of me?

90
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:55,900
<2-32,Penny>我很招人喜欢啊
<2-32,Penny>I'm adorable.

91
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,730
<2-33,Leonard>你确实是  只是
<2-33,Leonard>You are, it's just...

92
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,230
<2-33,Leonard>我能再打断一下吗
<2-33,Leonard>If I can interject again.

93
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,900
<2-34,Sheldon>莱纳德的家人都很优秀  成绩斐然
<2-34,Sheldon>Leonard comes from a remarkably high-achieving family,

94
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,930
<2-34,Sheldon>他们选择的伴侣也都很优秀
<2-34,Sheldon>who have all chosen high-achieving partners.

95
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,560
<2-34,Sheldon>他可能是觉得
<2-34,Sheldon>He probably feels

96
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:10,360
<2-34,Sheldon>他妈妈很难认同
<2-34,Sheldon>that it's doubtful that his mother will be overly impressed

97
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:13,200
<2-34,Sheldon>他跟一个  生平最高成就
<2-34,Sheldon>with his dating a woman whose most significant achievement

98
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:16,130
<2-34,Sheldon>就是背下芝士蛋糕工厂菜单的女人约会
<2-34,Sheldon>is memorizing the Cheesecake Factory menu.

99
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,330
<2-35,Penny>那可是份很长的菜单
<2-35,Penny>Hey, it's a big menu.

100
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,500
<2-35,Penny>光甜点就有两页
<2-35,Penny>There's two pages just for desserts.

101
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,730
<2-36,Leonard>我知道
<2-36,Leonard>I know.

102
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,930
<2-36,Leonard>还有每天一换的当日特餐
<2-36,Leonard>And those specials-- they change every day.

103
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,400
<2-37,Penny>好吧  我自己说起来就够废了
<2-37,Penny>Okay, you know what? It's lame when I say it.

104
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,430
<2-37,Penny>-你还添油加醋就更差了  -好吧
<2-37,Penny>- It's just ridiculous when you pile on. - Okay.

105
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,760
<2-38,Leonard>抱歉
<2-38,Leonard>Sorry.

106
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,760
<2-39,Penny>你跟她说我们在交往  她是怎么说的
<2-39,Penny>So what did she say when you told her we were going out?

107
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,960
<2-40,Leonard>嗯...
<2-40,Leonard>Um...

108
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:37,330
<2-41,Penny>你没告诉她我们在交往  是吧
<2-41,Penny>You didn't tell her we were going out, did you?

109
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,460
<2-40,Leonard>嗯...
<2-40,Leonard>Um...

110
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:40,960
<2-43,Penny>为什么不告诉她
<2-43,Penny>Why not?

111
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,300
<2-40,Leonard>-嗯...  -莱纳德
<2-40,Leonard>- Um... - Leonard...

112
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,900
<2-45,Sheldon>冥想我并不擅长
<2-45,Sheldon>I'm no expert on meditation,

113
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,530
<2-45,Sheldon>但如果你想要冷静下来
<2-45,Sheldon>but if you're trying to calm yourself down,

114
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,300
<2-45,Sheldon>我想最好说"唵"[印度教咒语]
<2-45,Sheldon>I believe the word is "Om."

115
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,060
<3-1,Beverley>你远道来机场接我
<3-1,Beverley>It was so nice of you

116
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:55,100
<3-1,Beverley>真是太贴心了
<3-1,Beverley>to come all the way down to the airport to pick me up.

117
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,460
<3-2,Sheldon>这没什么的
<3-2,Sheldon>No trouble at all.

118
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,530
<3-3,Leonard>是我开的车  妈妈
<3-3,Leonard>I drove, Mother.

119
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,660
<3-3,Leonard>现在也是我在开
<3-3,Leonard>I'm driving now.

120
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:03,200
<3-3,Leonard>没错  宝贝  你真是妈妈的骄傲
<3-3,Leonard>Yes, dear. Mommy's proud.

121
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,130
<3-4,Beverley>我一直很想感谢你
<3-4,Beverley>I've been meaning to thank you

122
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,360
<3-4,Beverley>为我的论文加的注解
<3-4,Beverley>for your notes on my paper

123
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:08,930
<3-4,Beverley>证明了量子脑动力学理论的荒谬
<3-4,Beverley>disproving quantum brain dynamic theory.

124
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,130
<3-5,Sheldon>我很荣幸
<3-5,Sheldon>My pleasure.

125
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,700
<3-5,Sheldon>作为非物理学家
<3-5,Sheldon>For a non-physicist,

126
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,360
<3-5,Sheldon>您对大脑水分子中的电偶极子
<3-5,Sheldon>you have a remarkable grasp

127
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:16,030
<3-5,Sheldon>难以形成玻色凝聚物的原因
<3-5,Sheldon>of how electric dipoles in the brain's water molecules

128
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,830
<3-5,Sheldon>理解得非常到位
<3-5,Sheldon>could not possibly form a Bose condensate.

129
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,300
<3-5,Sheldon>等等
<3-5,Sheldon>Wait, wait, wait.

130
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,200
<3-6,Leonard>你什么时候给我妈论文加的注解
<3-6,Leonard>When did you send my mom notes on a paper?

131
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,060
<3-7,Sheldon>8月16日
<3-7,Sheldon>August 16.

132
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:27,260
<3-7,Sheldon>就在她做完腕管综合症手术之后
<3-7,Sheldon>Right after her carpal tunnel surgery.

133
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:30,330
<3-8,Beverley>-我谢过你送的花了吗  -谢过了
<3-8,Beverley>- Oh, did I thank you for the flowers? - You did.

134
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,030
<3-10,Beverley>其实我并不喜欢花
<3-10,Beverley>I don't really like flowers.

135
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,000
<3-11,Sheldon>我也不喜欢  但那是社会习俗
<3-11,Sheldon>Neither do I, but it's the social convention.

136
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,160
<3-12,Beverley>是啊  没错
<3-12,Beverley>It is, isn't it?

137
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:38,160
<3-13,Leonard>等等  你动过手术
<3-13,Leonard>Wait, wait, wait. You had surgery?

138
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:40,000
<3-14,Beverley>是的  谢尔顿还送了花
<3-14,Beverley>Yes, and Sheldon sent me flowers.

139
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,330
<3-15,Leonard>我听到了
<3-15,Leonard>No, I heard that.

140
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,000
<3-16,Beverley>那你还"等等"什么
<3-16,Beverley>Then what was all that "wait, wait, wait" about?

141
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,660
<3-17,Leonard>我只是没搞明白
<3-17,Leonard>I just don't understand

142
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:48,500
<3-17,Leonard>他怎么比我还了解你的生活
<3-17,Leonard>why he knows more about your life than I do.

143
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,130
<3-18,Beverley>我认为是由于我和谢尔顿
<3-18,Beverley>Well, I would assume it's because Sheldon

144
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,400
<3-18,Beverley>因共同的兴趣和对彼此的尊重而时常联系
<3-18,Beverley>and I stay in touch due to mutual interest and respect,

145
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,760
<3-18,Beverley>而你却因你那
<3-18,Beverley>while you avoid me,

146
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:56,230
<3-18,Beverley>无法释怀的童年阴影  总是躲着我
<3-18,Beverley>due to unresolved childhood issues.

147
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,560
<3-19,Sheldon>我们认为正是这一点
<3-19,Sheldon>It's what we think

148
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,960
<3-19,Sheldon>引起了你的自恋型人格障碍
<3-19,Sheldon>caused your narcissistic personality disorder.

149
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:04,360
<3-19,Sheldon>我们上次视频聊天时详细地探讨了这个问题
<3-19,Sheldon>We discussed it at length during our last video chat.

150
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:07,560
<3-19,Sheldon>虽然不知道为什么会提到你
<3-19,Sheldon>Although how we got onto the subject of you is baffling.

151
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:09,900
<3-20,Beverley>没错  既然我们又提到了
<3-20,Beverley>Yes, but we are on the subject,

152
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,600
<3-20,Beverley>所以我不得不问一下
<3-20,Beverley>so I'm obliged to ask.

153
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,930
<3-20,Beverley>莱纳德  最近过得怎样
<3-20,Beverley>Leonard, how are you?

154
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,360
<3-21,Leonard>挺好  妈妈  你呢
<3-21,Leonard>Fine, Mom. How are you?

155
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,730
<3-22,Beverley>我绝经了
<3-22,Beverley>Mmm, menopausal.

156
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,360
<3-23,Leonard>现在我不怎么好了
<3-23,Leonard>Now I'm less fine.

157
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:23,260
<3-24,Beverley>你弟弟订婚了  你听说了吗
<3-24,Beverley>Have you heard your brother has gotten engaged?

158
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:24,760
<3-24,Beverley>没
<3-24,Beverley>No.

159
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,760
<3-25,Leonard>谢尔顿  你给我讲讲吧
<3-25,Leonard>Sheldon, why didn't you tell me?

160
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,600
<3-26,Sheldon>是我的错
<3-26,Sheldon>My bad.

161
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:31,200
<3-26,Sheldon>不过我代表我们两人送了礼
<3-26,Sheldon>I did send a gift from both of us.

162
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,000
<3-27,Beverley>她是个出众的女孩子
<3-27,Beverley>She's a remarkable girl.

163
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,000
<3-27,Beverley>新泽西州最年轻的上诉法院法官
<3-27,Beverley>The youngest appeals court judge in New Jersey

164
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,530
<3-27,Beverley>还两次获得奥运会铜牌
<3-27,Beverley>and a two-time Olympic bronze medalist.

165
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,560
<3-28,Leonard>那你肯定非常高兴
<3-28,Leonard>You must be very happy.

166
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,360
<3-29,Beverley>为什么  又不是我要娶她
<3-29,Beverley>Why? I'm not marrying her.

167
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,160
<3-29,Beverley>你最近怎么样
<3-29,Beverley>So, how about you?

168
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:45,900
<3-29,Beverley>跟什么有趣的人在交往吗
<3-29,Beverley>Are you seeing anyone interesting?

169
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,060
<3-30,Sheldon>我不确定她是不是有趣  不过...
<3-30,Sheldon>Well, I'm not sure about interesting, but...

170
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:49,860
<3-31,Leonard>谢尔顿  还不是时候
<3-31,Leonard>Not the time, Sheldon.

171
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:51,060
<3-32,Sheldon>好吧
<3-32,Sheldon>Very well.

172
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:52,760
<3-32,Sheldon>我们更换话题
<3-32,Sheldon>Shall we switch topics

173
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:55,800
<3-32,Sheldon>谈谈牛顿或莱布尼茨吧[两人曾先后独立发明微积分]
<3-32,Sheldon>to Isaac Newton v. Gottfried Leibniz?

174
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,630
<3-32,Sheldon>没事的  谢尔顿
<3-32,Sheldon>It's all right, Sheldon.

175
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,830
<3-33,Beverley>我会假装
<3-33,Beverley>I will just pretend

176
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,730
<3-33,Beverley>莱纳德没叫你瞒着我
<3-33,Beverley>that Leonard's not withholding information.

177
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,400
<3-33,Beverley>虽然我仍要指出  莱纳德
<3-33,Beverley>Although, I will point out, Leonard,

178
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,430
<3-33,Beverley>我是名训练有素的精神病学家
<3-33,Beverley>that I am a trained psychiatrist

179
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,260
<3-33,Beverley>你现在这偷偷摸摸欲盖弥彰的举动
<3-33,Beverley>and you are exhibiting the same secretive behavioral tics

180
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:10,530
<3-33,Beverley>跟你小时候学着手淫那会没什么两样
<3-33,Beverley>that accompanied your learning to masturbate.

181
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,500
<3-34,Sheldon>莱纳德  她太了不起了
<3-34,Sheldon>Isn't she brilliant, Leonard?

182
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,200
<3-34,Sheldon>我真羡慕你
<3-34,Sheldon>How I envy you.

183
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,000
<4-1,Beverley>霍华德
<4-1,Beverley>So, Howard,

184
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,830
<4-1,Beverley>你跟拉杰  终于鼓起了勇气
<4-1,Beverley>have you and Rajesh finally summoned the courage

185
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:28,130
<4-1,Beverley>向彼此表白了你们潜在的同性恋情结吗
<4-1,Beverley>to express your latent homosexual feelings toward one another?

186
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,530
<4-2,Howard>什么  没有
<4-2,Howard>What? No.

187
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,960
<4-3,Beverley>为什么没有
<4-3,Beverley>Why not?

188
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,960
<4-4,Howard>因为我们彼此之间  并没有
<4-4,Howard>Because we don't have latent homosexual feelings

189
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,360
<4-4,Howard>潜在的同性恋情结
<4-4,Howard>toward one another.

190
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:42,360
<4-5,Beverley>我明白了
<4-5,Beverley>I see.

191
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,360
<4-6,Howard>不  我说真的
<4-6,Howard>No, really.

192
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,030
<4-6,Howard>我现在有女朋友了
<4-6,Howard>I have a girlfriend now.

193
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,460
<4-7,Beverley>那她今晚在哪呢
<4-7,Beverley>And where is she this evening?

194
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:49,130
<4-8,Howard>她有事出了城
<4-8,Howard>She had to go out of town.

195
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,630
<4-9,Beverley>她祖母去世了
<4-9,Beverley>Her grandmother died.

196
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,730
<4-9,Beverley>我明白了
<4-9,Beverley>I see.

197
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,160
<4-9,Beverley>她祖母去世了
<4-9,Beverley>Her grandmother died.

198
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,230
<4-10,Howard>我说真的
<4-10,Howard>Honest to God.

199
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,400
<4-10,Howard>莱纳德  告诉她我有女朋友了
<4-10,Howard>Leonard, tell her I have a girlfriend.

200
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,460
<4-11,Leonard>我不懂你在说什么
<4-11,Leonard>I don't know what you're talking about.

201
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:05,300
<4-12,Howard>你什么意思  不懂我在说什么
<4-12,Howard>What do you mean you don't know what I'm talking about?

202
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,560
<4-12,Howard>告诉她我有女朋友了
<4-12,Howard>Tell her I have a girlfriend!

203
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:08,730
<4-13,Leonard>好吧
<4-13,Leonard>All right.

204
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,730
<4-13,Leonard>他"有女朋友了"
<4-13,Leonard>He "has" a "girlfriend."

205
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,330
<4-14,Howard>她叫伯纳黛特  也在当女侍应
<4-14,Howard>Her name is Bernadette. She's working as a waitress,

<4-14,Howard>不过还同时上学  想成为微生物学家
<4-14,Howard>but she's going to school to be a microbiologist.

207
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,560
<4-15,Beverley>霍华德  记住  你越是执着于
<4-15,Beverley>Howard, keep in mind that the more passionately

208
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:19,730
<4-15,Beverley>坚持这样的想法
<4-15,Beverley>you stick to this construct,

209
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,130
<4-15,Beverley>对你同伴的伤害  也就越大
<4-15,Beverley>the more you're hurting your partner.

210
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:28,460
<4-16,Howard (to Raj who has whispered to him)>你真以为对着我耳朵这么讲话有用吗
<4-16,Howard (to Raj who has whispered to him)>Do you really think your lips in my ear is helping?

00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,760
<4-17,Penny (arriving)>抱歉我来晚了
<4-17,Penny (arriving)>Hi. Sorry I'm late.

<4-18,Leonard>妈  记得佩妮吧
<4-18,Leonard>Mom, you remember Penny.

215
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:37,430
<4-19,Beverley>当然  那个有着无法释怀的恋父情结的
<4-19,Beverley>Oh, yes, the waitress slash actress

216
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,660
<4-19,Beverley>女招待兼女演员
<4-19,Beverley>with the unresolved father issues.

217
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:41,930
<4-19,Beverley>他最终正视到
<4-19,Beverley>Has he finally come to terms

218
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,930
<4-19,Beverley>他家的小小击球手  胸部渐隆了吗
<4-19,Beverley>with his little slugger growing breasts?

219
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,960
<4-20,Penny>他送了我个足球和棒球手套做圣诞礼物
<4-20,Penny>Well, he sent me a football and a catcher's mitt for Christmas,

220
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:50,300
<4-20,Penny>所以我想还是没有吧
<4-20,Penny>So I'm going to say no.

221
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,360
<4-21,Howard>如果这算安慰  我们都很垂涎你的丰胸
<4-21,Howard>If it helps, we're all good with your breasts.

<4-22,Beverley>Oh, speaking of fathers, Leonard,

224
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,430
<4-22,Beverley>我想起来了  我和你爸离婚了
<4-22,Beverley>That reminds me, I'm divorcing your father.

225
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,630
<4-23,Leonard>什么
<4-23,Leonard>What?!

226
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,030
<4-24,Beverley>他背着我出轨
<4-24,Beverley>Yes. He was cheating on me.

229
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:11,860
<4-26,Beverley>难以置信吧
<4-26,Beverley>Can you believe it?

230
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:13,900
<4-26,Beverley>居然和一个女招待
<4-26,Beverley>A waitress?

00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,960
<4-26,Beverley>无意冒犯  亲爱的

232
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,430
<4-27,Penny>没事  不知怎的听起来更像称赞
<4-27,Penny>No, it sounded like a compliment.

233
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,000
<4-28,Leonard>什么时候的事情
<4-28,Leonard>When did this happen?

234
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,300
<4-29,Beverley>让我想想
<4-29,Beverley>Mmm, well, let's see.

235

<4-29,Beverley>谢尔顿  我什么时候和他离婚的
<4-29,Beverley>Sheldon, when did I leave Leonard's father?

<4-31,Beverley>Oh, yes, that's right.

238
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:29,800
<4-31,Beverley>就在莱纳德的狗狗死后一周
<4-31,Beverley>The weekend after Leonard's dog died.

239
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,860
<4-32,Leonard>米琪死了吗
<4-32,Leonard>Mitzy's dead?!

240
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,400
<4-33,Sheldon>她已经又老又瞎了  莱纳德
<4-33,Sheldon>She was old and blind, Leonard.

241
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:38,230
<4-33,Sheldon>我们也无能为力
<4-33,Sheldon>What choice did we have?

242
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,360
<4-34,Leonard>我真不敢相信
<4-34,Leonard>I don't believe this.

243
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:41,000
<4-34,Leonard>为什么我是最后一个知道的
<4-34,Leonard>Why am I the last to know?!

244
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,160
<4-35,Beverley>不好意思  莱纳德  离婚的是我
<4-35,Beverley>Excuse me, Leonard, I am the one who's getting a divorce,

245
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:44,560
<4-35,Beverley>死的是米琪
<4-35,Beverley>Mitzy is the one who is dead.

246
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:46,800
<4-35,Beverley>你这么大惊小怪干嘛
<4-35,Beverley>Why are you the one making a fuss?

247
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,060
<4-35,Beverley>好吧
<4-35,Beverley>You're right.

248
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,100
<4-36,Leonard>我真是抱歉
<4-36,Leonard>I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm sorry.

249
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,160
<4-36,Leonard>过分的是我行了吧
<4-36,Leonard>I'm way out of line!

250
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,430
<4-37,Beverley>佩妮  你有什么新鲜事儿吗
<4-37,Beverley>So, Penny, what's new in your life?

251
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,460
<4-38,Penny>没
<4-38,Penny>Nothing.

252
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:00,200
<4-38,Penny>鬼都没有
<4-38,Penny>Not a damn thing.

253
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,840
<5-1,Beverley>谢谢你开车送我回酒店
<5-1,Beverley>Thank you for driving me back to my hotel.

254
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,340
<5-2,Penny>没事儿
<5-2,Penny>Oh, it's not a problem.

255
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,400
<5-3,Beverley>我本想让莱纳德送我
<5-3,Beverley>I was going to ask Leonard to do it,

256
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:14,700
<5-3,Beverley>但他似乎有点情绪波动
<5-3,Beverley>But he seemed a bit emotionally unstable

257
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:18,000
<5-3,Beverley>这样的人可不能操纵重型机械
<5-3,Beverley>And you don't want someone like that operating heavy machinery.

258
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:19,940
<5-4,Penny>没错  我同意
<5-4,Penny>No, you do not.

259
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,400
<5-5,Beverley>你车上的"检查引擎"提示灯亮了
<5-5,Beverley>Your "check engine" light is on.

260
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:26,240
<5-6,Penny>是啊  我真该贴张贴纸上去
<5-6,Penny>Yeah, I gotta put a sticker over that.

261
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,000
<5-6,Penny>离婚一定让你感到伤心欲绝吧
<5-6,Penny>So, uh, you must be devastated about your divorce.

262
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,340
<5-7,Beverley>一点也不
<5-7,Beverley>Oh, not at all.

263
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,370
<5-7,Beverley>倒是坐在一辆不进行例行维护的汽车里
<5-7,Beverley>But I am a bit distressed to be in a vehicle

264
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,200
<5-7,Beverley>让我感到有些焦虑
<5-7,Beverley>That's not subjected to regular maintenance.

265
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:41,440
<5-8,Penny>等等  你的婚姻终结了
<5-8,Penny>Come on, I mean, you're not upset

266
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,870
<5-8,Penny>你却一点不难过吗
<5-8,Penny>that your marriage is over?

267
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:45,220
<5-9,Beverley>一开始  我感到类似悲伤
<5-9,Beverley>Well, initially I felt something akin to grief

268
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,500
<5-9,Beverley>或近似生气的情绪
<5-9,Beverley>And perhaps anger,

269
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:50,600
<5-9,Beverley>但是在那不要脸的狗杂种背叛我之后
<5-9,Beverley>But that's the natural reaction of the limbic system

270
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:53,500
<5-9,Beverley>大脑边缘系统的自然反应
<5-9,Beverley>To being betrayed by a loathsome son of a bitch.

271
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,540
<5-10,Penny>很有理
<5-10,Penny>Sure, sure.

272
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,770
<5-11,Beverley>但好在我已经8年没和他发生性关系了
<5-11,Beverley>Thankfully, my shock was somewhat mitigated by the fact

273
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,300
<5-11,Beverley>这也多少减轻了打击程度
<5-11,Beverley>That I haven't had intercourse with him in eight years.

274
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:02,140
<5-12,Penny>居然有八年
<5-12,Penny>Eight years?

275
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,670
<5-13,Beverley>这没什么
<5-13,Beverley>Oh, that's nothing.

276
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:08,140
<5-13,Beverley>自1982年来  性高潮问题都是我自行解决
<5-13,Beverley>I've been responsible for my own orgasms since 1982.

277
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,070
<5-13,Beverley>欧耶
<5-13,Beverley>Yikes.

278
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:15,640
<5-14,Penny>笑什么
<5-14,Penny>What's so funny?

279
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:20,400
<5-15,Beverley>我性高潮时都用这个词儿  "欧耶"
<5-15,Beverley>That's exactly what I say during orgasms: "Yikes."

280
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:21,900
<5-16,Penny>我现在真想喝一杯
<5-16,Penny>You know what? I could use a drink.

281
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:23,400
<5-16,Penny>顺道去喝一杯吗
<5-16,Penny>Do you want to stop for a drink?

282
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:25,770
<5-18,Penny>-我不喝酒  -有我教你呢
<5-18,Penny>- Oh, I don't drink.  - I do, I'll teach you.

283
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,870
<6-1,Sheldon>莱纳德
<6-1,Sheldon>Leonard?

284
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,300
<6-1,Sheldon>莱纳德
<6-1,Sheldon>Leonard?

285
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:31,970
<6-1,Sheldon>莱纳德
<6-1,Sheldon>Leonard...?

286
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,100
<6-2,Leonard>干嘛
<6-2,Leonard>What is it?

287
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:37,240
<6-3,Sheldon>我泡了茶
<6-3,Sheldon>I made tea.

288
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,740
<6-4,Leonard>我不想喝茶
<6-4,Leonard>I don't want tea.

289
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,700
<6-5,Sheldon>又不是泡给你喝的
<6-5,Sheldon>I didn't make tea for you.

290
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,500
<6-5,Sheldon>这是我的茶
<6-5,Sheldon>This is my tea.

291
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:48,870
<6-6,Leonard>那你告诉我干嘛
<6-6,Leonard>Then why are you telling me?

292
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:51,500
<6-7,Sheldon>这算是开场白
<6-7,Sheldon>It's a conversation starter.

293
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:54,700
<6-8,Leonard>这开场白烂透了
<6-8,Leonard>That's a lousy conversation starter.

294
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:56,170
<6-9,Sheldon>是吗  我们不是开始聊天了吗
<6-9,Sheldon>Oh, is it? We're conversing.

295
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,740
<6-9,Sheldon>将军  你输了
<6-9,Sheldon>Checkmate.

296
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,340
<6-10,Leonard>你到底想要干嘛  谢尔顿
<6-10,Leonard>What do you want, Sheldon?

297
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,100
<6-11,Sheldon>我想要从企业号星舰飞船上
<6-11,Sheldon>What I want is to be departing the starship Enterprise

298
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:06,140
<6-11,Sheldon>乘坐单人穿梭机前往由我统治的星球
<6-11,Sheldon>In a one-man shuttle craft headed to the planetoid I rule

00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,540
<6-11,Sheldon>著名的谢尔顿阿尔法5号星球
<6-11,Sheldon>Known as Sheldon Alpha Five.

300
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,070
<6-12,Leonard>这我也想
<6-12,Leonard>I want that too.

301
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:13,500
<6-12,Leonard>我问你来这里干嘛
<6-12,Leonard>Why are you here?

302
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:15,440
<6-13,Sheldon>当然是来安慰你
<6-13,Sheldon>To comfort you, of course.

303
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,400
<6-13,Sheldon>哦不  这个位置一点也不好
<6-13,Sheldon>No, that's not going to work at all.

304
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:22,740
<6-13,Sheldon>我还是到那边去安慰你吧
<6-13,Sheldon>I'll comfort you from over here.

305
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:29,500
<6-13,Sheldon>莱纳德  你现在的心理状态
<6-13,Sheldon>Leonard, what you're experiencing

306
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:31,800
<6-13,Sheldon>是典型的荣格主义危机[著名瑞士心理学家]
<6-13,Sheldon>Is a classic Jungian crisis

307
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:35,170

00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,840
<6-14,Leonard>多谢  真是倍感安慰
<6-14,Leonard>Thank you, that's very comforting.

310
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,900
<6-15,Sheldon>我还没说到安慰部分呢
<6-15,Sheldon>That's not the comforting part.

311
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,700
<6-16,Leonard>还没说到啊
<6-16,Leonard>It's not?

312
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:44,940
<6-16,Leonard>当然
<6-16,Leonard>No, no.

313
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,440
<6-17,Sheldon>安慰部分是  对于你现在的感受
<6-17,Sheldon>The comforting part is that the Germans

314
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,470
<6-17,Sheldon>德国人提出了一个专业术语
<6-17,Sheldon>Have a term for what you're feeling.

315
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,900
<6-17,Sheldon>悲观主义

316
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,600
<6-17,Sheldon>意思是
<6-17,Sheldon>It means

317
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:55,900
<6-17,Sheldon>由假设与理想世界和现实世界之间
<6-17,Sheldon>the depression that arises from comparing the world as it is

00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:59,440
<6-17,Sheldon>比较产生的落差从而导致的抑郁情绪
<6-17,Sheldon>To a hypothetical, idealized world.

319
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,070
<6-18,Leonard>果不其然  我还真好受点了
<6-18,Leonard>You're right, I do feel better.

320
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:05,940
<6-19,Sheldon>德国人在安慰方面还真有一套
<6-19,Sheldon>Well, the Germans have always been a comforting people.

321
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:11,900
<6-19,Sheldon>莱纳德  只要记住  即使你的亲生家人
<6-19,Sheldon>Just remember, Leonard, where your biological family

322
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:16,270
<6-19,Sheldon>有负于你  至少你还有我  你的替代家人
<6-19,Sheldon>Has failed you, you always have me, your surrogate family.

323
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:20,340
<6-20,Leonard>你是我的替代家人
<6-20,Leonard>You're my surrogate family?

324
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,240
<6-21,Sheldon>如果这算是安慰  我也没什么好高兴的
<6-21,Sheldon>If it's any consolation, I'm not happy about it either.

325
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,640
<6-21,Sheldon>晚安
<6-21,Sheldon>Good night.

326

327
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,940
<7-2,Beverley>欧耶
<7-2,Beverley>Yikes.

328
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,670
<7-3,Penny>自2003年起  我就自行解决酒后兴奋的问题
<7-3,Penny>I've been responsible for my own buzz since 2003.

329
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:54,740
<7-3,Penny>给我和我闺蜜再满上
<7-3,Penny>Another round for me and my homegirl.

330
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,500
<7-4,Beverley>我感到一阵暖意扩散到四肢
<7-4,Beverley>I feel a spreading warmth through my extremities.

331
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,700
<7-5,Penny>只要别暖到让你
<7-5,Penny>As long as you don't feel it

332
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:02,030
<7-5,Penny>想脱裤子  就准没事
<7-5,Penny>Running down your pants, you're fine.

333
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:14,230
<7-6,Beverley>这一下太猛了
<7-6,Beverley>Oh, that is fascinating.

334
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:17,870
<7-6,Beverley>我感觉自己一下就没了矜持
<7-6,Beverley>I'm noticing an immediate lowering of my inhibitions.

335
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:20,030
<7-6,Beverley>比如说
<7-6,Beverley>For example,

336
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,900
<7-6,Beverley>我很认真地考虑起  去叫那打杂的
<7-6,Beverley>I'm seriously considering asking that busboy

337
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:28,130
<7-6,Beverley>让我边吃着芝士蛋糕  边在后巷强奸我
<7-6,Beverley>To ravish me in the alleyway while I eat cheesecake.

338
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,070
<7-6,Beverley>你怎么想
<7-6,Beverley>What do you think?

339

<7-8,Beverley>如果喝一点感觉就这么爽  再喝一定更爽
<7-8,Beverley>If a little is good, more must be better.

342
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,530
<7-9,Penny>-贝芙  你猜怎么着  -什么
<7-9,Penny>- Hey, Bev, guess what?  - What?

00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,530
<7-11,Penny>我跟你儿子上床了
<7-11,Penny>I'm sleeping with your son.

344
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,700
<7-12,Beverley>真的  哪个儿子
<7-12,Beverley>Really? Which one?

345
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:56,130
<7-13,Penny>就是住在我家对面的那个
<7-13,Penny>The one from whom I live across the hall... from.

346
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,300
<7-14,Beverley>那倒是很方便
<7-14,Beverley>Well, that's convenient.

347
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:00,230
<7-14,Beverley>他的小弟弟咋样
<7-14,Beverley>How did his penis turn out?

348
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:04,930
<7-15,Penny>贝芙丽  我可不想跟我男友的母亲
<7-15,Penny>Oh, Beverly, I can't talk to my boyfriend's mother

349
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,530
<7-16,Beverley>-讨论他的小弟弟  -有道理
<7-16,Beverley>- About his penis.  - Oh, fair enough.

350
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,200
<7-16,Beverley>那你对那打杂的
<7-16,Beverley>What can you tell me, if anything,

351
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:10,630
<7-16,Beverley>他的小弟弟  有何见解
<7-16,Beverley>About that busboy's penis?

<7-17,Penny>其实  我只吃过芝士蛋糕
<7-17,Penny>Actually, I've only had the cheesecake.

353
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:20,630

<7-17,Penny>One more time.

354
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:24,100
<7-17,Penny>莱纳德不想告诉你我俩在交往
<7-17,Penny>You know, Leonard did not want to tell you we were dating.

355
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:25,400
<7-17,Penny>真的
<7-17,Penny>Really?

356
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:27,100
<7-18,Beverley>这要不就意味着
<7-18,Beverley>Well, that means he's either

357
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:28,500
<7-18,Beverley>他对你们的关系感到尴尬
<7-18,Beverley>Embarrassed about the relationship

358
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:30,530
<7-18,Beverley>要不就是他不怎么在乎他老妈
<7-18,Beverley>Or he doesn't care enough about his mother

359
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,230
<7-18,Beverley>不想告诉她  他在跟人交往
<7-18,Beverley>To tell her he's in one.

<7-18,Beverley>不管是哪个原因  我俩总有个人受辱
<7-18,Beverley>Either way, one of us should be insulted.

361

<7-19,Penny>咱去证实下  到底是谁受辱
<7-19,Penny>Well, let's go find out who.

362
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:40,770
<7-20,Beverley>你先去拦辆出租
<7-20,Beverley>You go get a taxi.

363
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:42,930
<7-20,Beverley>我得去往那打杂的屁股兜里
<7-20,Beverley>I'm gonna slip my business card

364
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,900
<7-20,Beverley>塞张我的名片
<7-20,Beverley>Into that busboy's back pocket,

365
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:50,170
<7-20,Beverley>扯起他的制服  塞他右半边屁股兜里
<7-20,Beverley>Cupping his firm, right buttock as I do so.

371
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:07,270
<8-5,Penny>你麻烦大了
<8-5,Penny>You're in trouble.

372
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:11,000
<8-6,Beverley>你干嘛不告诉我  你在追我的闺蜜
<8-6,Beverley>Why didn't you tell me you were tapping my homegirl?

373
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,470
<8-6,Beverley>我这样说对吗
<8-6,Beverley>Did I say that right?

<8-9,Beverley>我倒想的
<8-9,Beverley>Well, I hope so.

377
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:26,900
<8-9,Beverley>不然  我们干嘛停在Del Taco[著名快餐店]
<8-9,Beverley>Otherwise, why would we have stopped at Del Taco?

378

382
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,700
<8-11,Beverley>是因为她没啥文化
<8-11,Beverley>Is it because she's uneducated,

383
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:41,170
<8-11,Beverley>又做的是低贱的服务生吗
<8-11,Beverley>Trapped in a menial service position?

<8-16,Beverley (gives him an uncomfortable hug)>我感到一阵暖意  扩散到心头
<8-16,Beverley (gives him an uncomfortable hug)>I'm getting a warm feeling spreading through my heart.

398
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,770
<8-18,Sheldon>轻撞他卧室的门

<9-16,Beverley>也别让她自个儿解决性高潮问题
<9-16,Beverley>Don't make her responsible for her own orgasms as well.
