1
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:05,710
<1-1,Sheldon>会有多疼啊
<1-1,Sheldon>How much will it hurt?

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,770
<1-2,Amy>只是一块小小皮肤样本
<1-2,Amy>It's just a tiny skin sample.

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:09,800
<1-2,Amy>你也看过我给自己取样本的样子了
<1-2,Amy>You saw me do it to myself.

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,290
<1-3,Sheldon>疼痛程度按1到10分
<1-3,Sheldon>On a scale of one to ten,

5
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:13,390
<1-3,Sheldon>1分是鞋子里进石子
<1-3,Sheldon>where one is a pebble in your shoe

6
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:15,740
<1-3,Sheldon>10分是你以为是爱宠的猴子
<1-3,Sheldon>and ten is the monkey you thought

7
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:18,410
<1-3,Sheldon>正在啃掉你脸的疼痛度
<1-3,Sheldon>was your pet biting your face off.

8
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:19,790
<1-4,Amy>2分
<1-4,Amy>A two.

9
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:22,330
<1-5,Sheldon>吃超超凉薄荷糖的程度吗
<1-5,Sheldon>Eating a whole Altoid?

10
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:26,030
<1-6,Amy>要想我通过我们的皮肤细胞
<1-6,Amy>Sheldon, if I'm gonna synthesize a neural network

11
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:28,470
<1-6,Amy>来合成出神经网络  我就得先采集材料啊
<1-6,Amy>from our skin cells, I need to harvest them.

12
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,020
<1-6,Amy>我取样本已经驾轻就熟了
<1-6,Amy>Now, I've done this dozens of times,

13
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:32,110
<1-6,Amy>但如果你要是怕  也不用勉强
<1-6,Amy>but if you're too scared you don't have to.

14
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:34,080
<1-7,Sheldon>不行  这是为了科学
<1-7,Sheldon>No, this is for science.

15
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,190
<1-7,Sheldon>我可以为科学而勇敢
<1-7,Sheldon>I can be brave for science.

16
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,100
<1-8,Amy>谢谢啊
<1-8,Amy>Thank you.

17
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,370
<1-9,Sheldon>我擦  好冰啊
<1-9,Sheldon>Oh, jiminy, that's cold!

18
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,510
<1-10,Amy>你就想着几周后
<1-10,Amy>Just think how happy you'll be in a few weeks

19
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:44,790
<1-10,Amy>当我把我们的皮肤细胞
<1-10,Amy>when I've converted our skin cells

20
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:47,210
<1-10,Amy>转化为功能性脑细胞时  你会多开心
<1-10,Amy>into functional brain cells.

21
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:50,400
<1-11,Sheldon>好吧  那你下手前一定要先提醒我
<1-11,Sheldon>All right, just warn me before you do it.

22
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,940
<1-11,Sheldon>好
<1-11,Sheldon>Okay.

23
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:53,970
<1-12,Amy>三
<1-12,Amy>Three...

24
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,820
<1-12,Amy>二...  搞定啦
<1-12,Amy>two... and we're done.

25
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,540
<1-13,Sheldon>你骗了我
<1-13,Sheldon>You tricked me.

26
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,000
<1-13,Sheldon>你没喊一
<1-13,Sheldon>You didn't say one.

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,160
<1-14,Amy>-那也不疼啊  不是吗  -是不疼...
<1-14,Amy>- It didn't hurt, did it? - No...

28
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,320
<1-15,Sheldon>但"三  二  搞定啦"不完整啊
<1-15,Sheldon>but "Three, two and we're done" is incomplete.

29
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,340
<1-15,Sheldon>你明知道这样会让我很闹心
<1-15,Sheldon>You know those things bother me.

30
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,990
<1-15,Sheldon>就像是听到...
<1-15,Sheldon>It's like hearing "Da-da-da-da-da-dah"

31
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:10,750
<1-15,Sheldon>而不接着喊出...
<1-15,Sheldon>without yelling...

32
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,460
<1-16,Amy>服了你  行  一
<1-16,Amy>Okay, fine, one.

33
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:14,130
<1-16,Amy>谢谢
<1-16,Amy>Thank you.

34
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:17,060
<1-17,Sheldon>现在大喊"冲啊"  我们就可以杀出去了
<1-17,Sheldon>Now yell "Charge" and we can get out of here.

35
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:17,060
<1-17,Sheldon>该旋律《Charge》曾在球赛
<1-17,Sheldon>与卡通《摩登原始人》中出现而闻名

45
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,880
<2-1,Raj>天啊  我现在懂了
<2-1,Raj>Oh, my God, I just got it.

46
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,810
<2-1,Raj>有趣的洋葱圈
<2-1,Raj>Fun onions...

47
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,060
<2-1,Raj>趣葱圈
<2-1,Raj>Funyuns.

48
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,470
<2-1,Raj>等等
<2-1,Raj>Hold on.

49
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,800
<2-1,Raj>是摆动吗
<2-1,Raj>Is that a wobble?

50
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,110
<2-1,Raj>是呢
<2-1,Raj>Yes.

51
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:02,510
<2-1,Raj>绝对是个引力摆动
<2-1,Raj>That's definitely a gravitational wobble.

52
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:04,440
<2-2,Cleaner>抱歉打扰了  我等下再过来吧
<2-2,Cleaner>Uh, sorry, I could come back.

53
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,260
<2-3,Raj>没事的
<2-3,Raj>Oh, no, it's okay.

54
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,090
<2-3,Raj>我刚才发现了一个摆动[有点滑]
<2-3,Raj>I-I just found a wobble.

55
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:09,720
<2-4,Cleaner>需要我去拿拖把吗
<2-4,Cleaner>Oh, do I need a mop?

56
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,210
<2-4,Cleaner>是引力摆动
<2-4,Cleaner>It's a gravitational wobble.

57
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:13,990
<2-5,Raj>这表示有可能发现了一颗
<2-5,Raj>It could be a sign of an extrasolar planet

58
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:16,680
<2-5,Raj>蕴涵有生命的系外行星  某天会以我名字而命名呢
<2-5,Raj>that may contain life and someday be named after me.

59
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,920
<2-6,Cleaner>如果上面已经有生命了
<2-6,Cleaner>Oh... well, if it has life,

60
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,710
<2-6,Cleaner>那它估计已经有名字了吧
<2-6,Cleaner>maybe it already has a name, huh?

61
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,850
<2-7,Raj>的确  但有可能对我们来说很难发音
<2-7,Raj>Yeah, but it's probably difficult to pronounce.

62
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,020
<2-8,Cleaner>你叫什么名字
<2-8,Cleaner>What is your name?

63
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:27,010
<2-8,Cleaner>拉杰什·罗摩衍·库萨帕里
<2-8,Cleaner>Rajesh Ramayan Koothrappali.

64
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,600
<2-9,Cleaner>你觉得能比这个还难念吗
<2-9,Cleaner>You think it would be more difficult than that?

65
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,530
<2-10,Raj>有道理
<2-10,Raj>Good point.

66
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:33,420
<2-10,Raj>小姐芳名
<2-10,Raj>And you are?

67
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,320
<2-11,Cleaner>伊莎贝拉·玛丽亚·康赛普西翁
<2-11,Cleaner>Oh, uh, Issabella Maria Concepcion.

68
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,510
<2-12,Raj>很高兴认识你
<2-12,Raj>Oh, well, nice to meet you.

69
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,200
<2-12,Raj>我也是
<2-12,Raj>Nice to meet you, too.

70
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,210
<2-13,Isabella>我不得不说
<2-13,Isabella>You know, I have to say,

71
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:41,540
<2-13,Isabella>从垃圾桶里的糖果包装纸
<2-13,Isabella>based on the candy wrappers

72
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,900
<2-13,Isabella>还有垃圾食品的包装袋来看
<2-13,Isabella>and the bags of junk food I see in this trash,

73
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:47,350
<2-13,Isabella>我本来以为在这里工作的人是个十岁小孩呢
<2-13,Isabella>I thought the person working here was ten years old.

74
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,310
<2-14,Raj>拜托  世上哪里有十岁就懂
<2-14,Raj>Oh, please, show me a ten-year-old who knows

75
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:52,200
<2-14,Raj>拿巧克力棒沾巧克力酱的孩子啊
<2-14,Raj>to dip Tootsie Rolls in Nutella.

76
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:55,230
<2-15,Isabella>好啦  我清空一下你的废纸篓
<2-15,Isabella>Bueno, um, I'm just going to empty your waste paper basket

77
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,410
<2-15,Isabella>然后我就不打扰你了
<2-15,Isabella>and then I'll get out of your way.

78
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,830
<2-16,Raj>放着我来
<2-16,Raj>Oh, please, allow me.

79
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:03,730
<2-16,Raj>好多的无营养热量啊
<2-16,Raj>That's a lot of empty calories.

80
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:05,250
<2-17,Isabella>谢谢
<2-17,Isabella>Thank you.

81
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,710
<2-18,Raj>不客气
<2-18,Raj>You're welcome.

82
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,580
<2-19,Isabella>好了  我该走了
<2-19,Isabella>Okay, uh, okay, I-I-I have to go.

83
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:16,800
<2-21,Isabella>祝你的太空探索好运啦
<2-21,Isabella>Good luck with your, um, space exploration.

84
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,750
<2-21,Isabella>谢谢
<2-21,Isabella>Thank you.

85
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:18,990
<2-21,Isabella>也祝你...
<2-21,Isabella>Good luck with your...

86
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,410
<2-22,Raj>万事如意
<2-22,Raj>future endeavors.

87
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:26,520
<3-1,Sheldon>成功了吗
<3-1,Sheldon>Did it work?

88
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,160
<3-1,Sheldon>变成大脑细胞了吗
<3-1,Sheldon>Are they brain cells yet?

89
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,950
<3-2,Amy>你安静等我一会  我就能回答你了
<3-2,Amy>If you'd give me a minute, I'll tell you.

90
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,490
<3-3,Sheldon>让我自己来看
<3-3,Sheldon>Oh, just let me look.

91
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,710
<3-3,Sheldon>我的老天爷啊
<3-3,Sheldon>Oh, my goodness!

92
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,840
<3-3,Sheldon>我看到颤抖的黑线了
<3-3,Sheldon>I see quivering black lines.

93
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,420
<3-3,Sheldon>那些肯定是神经元
<3-3,Sheldon>Those must be neurons.

94
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:40,860
<3-3,Sheldon>它们又粗又充满美感
<3-3,Sheldon>Oh, they're so thick and beautiful.

95
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,430
<3-4,Amy>那是你的眼睫毛  让开
<3-4,Amy>Those are your eyelashes, move.

96
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:48,130
<3-4,Amy>谢尔顿
<3-4,Amy>Well, Sheldon...

97
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:51,310
<3-4,Amy>我看到了星形胶质细胞
<3-4,Amy>I see astrocytes.

98
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:54,930
<3-4,Amy>我们皮肤细胞的结合现在是原始的神经网络了
<3-4,Amy>Our combined skin cells are now a primitive neural network.

99
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,790
<3-5,Sheldon>我内心有无比深刻的造物感
<3-5,Sheldon>I have such a profound sense of creation.

100
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:03,870
<3-5,Sheldon>就像小时候孵化海猴子一样
<3-5,Sheldon>I ju... it's like when I hatched Sea-Monkeys,

101
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:05,430
<3-5,Sheldon>曾流行过的儿童养殖玩具  把卵加入水中
<3-5,Sheldon>即可孵出丰年虾[海猴]

102
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,430
<3-5,Sheldon>但这个是用我DNA创造的
<3-5,Sheldon>except that this is from my DNA,

103
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,810
<3-5,Sheldon>所以简直就像是...
<3-5,Sheldon>so this is like...

104
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:08,360
<3-5,Sheldon>我猴
<3-5,Sheldon>Me-Monkeys.

105
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,890
<3-6,Amy>这些细胞我们俩人的共同产物
<3-6,Amy>These cells come from both of us.

106
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:14,320
<3-7,Sheldon>但是"我们的猴"听起来就不带劲儿啊
<3-7,Sheldon>Yeah, but Us-Monkeys doesn't pop.

107
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,110
<3-7,Sheldon>等等  等等
<3-7,Sheldon>Oh, oh, oh, oh, wait!

108
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:18,290
<3-7,Sheldon>咱们猴  这下满意了吧
<3-7,Sheldon>We-Monkeys, there you go.

109
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,730
<3-7,Sheldon>我们可以开始在它们身上做实验了吗
<3-7,Sheldon>When can we start running tests on it?

110
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,610
<3-8,Amy>当然可以现在动手啦
<3-8,Amy>No reason we can't start right now.

111
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,670
<3-9,Sheldon>我们该先用什么刺激它呢
<3-9,Sheldon>What stimulus should we introduce it to first?

112
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:26,550
<3-9,Sheldon>光  声音  温度
<3-9,Sheldon>L-Light, sound, temperature...

113
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,650
<3-9,Sheldon>不如给它看我和你的照片
<3-9,Sheldon>Let's expose it to images of me and you

114
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:31,860
<3-10,Amy>看看它更喜欢谁
<3-10,Amy>and see who it likes better.

115
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,650
<3-10,Amy>谢尔顿  这只是一个未成熟的神经元组
<3-10,Amy>Sheldon, this is a rudimentary collection of neurons.

116
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:35,410
<3-10,Amy>虽然很了不起
<3-10,Amy>I mean, it's remarkable,

117
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,190
<3-10,Amy>但它能做的事还是很有限
<3-10,Amy>but it's still limited in what it can do.

118
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,480
<3-10,Amy>明白
<3-10,Amy>I understand.

119
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,210
<3-11,Sheldon>妈妈凶巴巴  爸爸笑哈哈
<3-11,Sheldon>She's the mean one, I'm the fun one.

120
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:47,690
<4-1,Howard>餐厅搞错了  给我们放了清蒸西兰花
<4-1,Howard>Huh, they screwed up and gave us steamed broccoli.

121
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:48,890
<4-2,Raj>没错  那是我的
<4-2,Raj>Oh, no, that's mine.

122
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:49,550
<4-2,Raj>不是吧
<4-2,Raj>Really?

123
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,390
<4-3,Leonard>我上次看到你吃绿色的东西是彩虹糖
<4-3,Leonard>The last green thing I saw you eat was a Skittle.

124
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,630
<4-4,Raj>我的饮食不能总像一个十岁小孩吧
<4-4,Raj>Well, I can't eat like a ten-year-old all the time.

125
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:57,750
<4-5,Penny>你有对象了  说吧是谁
<4-5,Penny>You're dating somebody, who is it?

126
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:58,820
<4-6,Raj>什么
<4-6,Raj>What?

127
00:04:58,820 --> 00:04:59,860
<4-6,Raj>你在胡说什么呀
<4-6,Raj>What are you talking about?

128
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,430
<4-7,Penny>你会注意饮食只有一个原因
<4-7,Penny>You only watch what you eat when you're afraid

129
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:03,830
<4-7,Penny>你害怕可能得在别人面前脱衣服
<4-7,Penny>you might have to take your shirt off.

130
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,900
<3-8,Amy>没错  她说得对
<3-8,Amy>No, she's right.

131
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,140
<4-8,Howard>自打我认识你以来
<4-8,Howard>As long as I've known you,

132
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,570
<4-8,Howard>你一直都很在意自己的乳沟
<4-8,Howard>you've always been self-conscious about your cleavage.

133
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:14,010
<4-9,Raj>那是因为你老想把铅笔夹里面
<4-9,Raj>It's because you keep trying to stick pencils in it.

134
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,870
<4-10,Penny>好吧  那行  别跟我们说
<4-10,Penny>All right, fine, don't tell us.

135
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,360
<4-11,Raj>-本来就没什么好说的  -好吧
<4-11,Raj>- There's nothing to tell. - All right.

136
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,110
<4-13,Leonard>西兰花味道怎么样
<4-13,Leonard>How's that broccoli?

137
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:29,150
<4-14,Raj>难吃又不得不吃  因为我有对象了
<4-14,Raj>It's gross but I have to eat it because I met somebody.

138
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:29,820
<4-15,Penny>看吧
<4-15,Penny>Bam.

139
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,070
<4-15,Penny>多谢
<4-15,Penny>Thank you.

140
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:31,830
<4-15,Penny>她叫什么
<4-15,Penny>What's her name?

141
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:32,700
<4-15,Penny>伊莎贝拉
<4-15,Penny>Issabella.

142
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,480
<4-17,Howard>你是在工作时认识她的吗
<4-17,Howard>Oh, did you meet her at work?

143
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:38,000
<4-18,Raj>是的  在观测室认识的
<4-18,Raj>Yes, in the telescope room.

144
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,290
<4-19,Leonard>所以她是天文学家吗
<4-19,Leonard>Oh, so she's an astronomer?

145
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:41,960
<4-18,Raj>是的
<4-18,Raj>Yes...

146
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,830
<4-20,Raj>不然她怎么会在观测室
<4-20,Raj>which is why she was in the telescope room.

147
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,480
<4-20,Raj>这就都说得通了  太好了
<4-20,Raj>Yes, this is all making sense. Good.

148
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:47,990
<4-21,Penny>不错嘛  拉杰
<4-21,Penny>Well, that's great, Raj.

149
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,580
<4-21,Penny>你们一定有很多共同点
<4-21,Penny>You must have so much in common.

150
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:52,090
<4-23,Howard>那我们什么时候能见见她
<4-23,Howard>So, when do we meet her?

151
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:53,860
<4-24,Raj>还不行  刚刚认识的
<4-24,Raj>No, no, this is brand-new.

152
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:56,200
<4-24,Raj>我们都没有正式约过会呢
<4-24,Raj>We haven't even been on a proper date yet.

153
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,120
<4-25,Leonard>-好吧  那祝你好运  -谢谢
<4-25,Leonard>- Okay, well, good luck with it. - Thank you.

154
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:02,690
<4-27,Penny>你怎么从来不吃西兰花
<4-27,Penny>How come you never eat broccoli?

155
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:03,930
<4-28,Leonard>我都结婚了
<4-28,Leonard>I'm married,

156
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,120
<4-28,Leonard>不需要注意形象
<4-28,Leonard>I don't have to be attractive.

157
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,130
<5-1,Amy>大多人都不知道这项技术
<5-1,Amy>You know, most people don't realize this technique

158
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:14,000
<5-1,Amy>其实好几年前就有了
<5-1,Amy>has actually been around for a few years.

159
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,710
<5-2,Bernadette>可我仍不敢相信你能把普通的皮肤细胞
<5-2,Bernadette>Still, I can't believe you can turn ordinary skin cells

160
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,550
<5-2,Bernadette>变成功能性脑细胞
<5-2,Bernadette>into functioning brain cells.

161
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:20,560
<5-3,Amy>我把这木头变成了功能完备的男友
<5-3,Amy>Well, I turned this one into a functioning boyfriend,

162
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,420
<5-3,Amy>所以世上无事不可为
<5-3,Amy>so sky's the limit.

163
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,270
<5-4,Sheldon>快看快看  这就是我
<5-4,Sheldon>Look, look... here I am

164
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,800
<5-4,Sheldon>站在细胞培养器旁边
<5-4,Sheldon>standing next to the incubator.

165
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:33,860
<5-4,Sheldon>这是显微镜下细胞的样子
<5-4,Sheldon>Uh, here is a microscopic view of the cells.

166
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:36,490
<5-5,Bernadette>瞧瞧  给它们穿一件小闪电侠T恤
<5-5,Bernadette>Look at that, put them in a tiny Flash T-shirt

167
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:38,070
<5-5,Bernadette>就长得跟你一样了
<5-5,Bernadette>and it's you.

168
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:41,570
<5-6,Sheldon>这个小家伙识别
<5-6,Sheldon>Yeah, this little guy can already recognize

169
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:43,320
<5-6,Sheldon>电子传输图像的速度
<5-6,Sheldon>electronically transmitted images

170
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:47,620
<5-6,Sheldon>已经比艾米实验室里所有样本都快20%
<5-6,Sheldon>20% faster than any other sample in Amy's lab.

171
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:50,300
<5-7,Bernadette>我已经没办法继续假装对此兴奋了
<5-7,Bernadette>I'm running out of ways to act excited.

172
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:54,920
<5-8,Amy>不说我们了  你最近怎么样
<5-8,Amy>So, enough about us, how are things going with you?

173
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,830
<5-9,Bernadette>非常好  医生说宝宝现在头朝下了
<5-9,Bernadette>Great, the doctor said the baby's head is facing down now.

174
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,220
<5-10,Amy>那就好
<5-10,Amy>Good, you know,

175
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,780
<5-10,Amy>以防出口不明显  找不到
<5-10,Amy>in case the exit isn't clearly marked.

176
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:05,560
<5-11,Sheldon>是啊  我必须要说能跟
<5-11,Sheldon>Yeah, I have to say, it is nice to share

178
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,140
<5-11,Sheldon>有相同进程的人分享这种体验  感觉真好
<5-11,Sheldon>this experience with someone who's on the same journey.

179
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,410
<5-11,Sheldon>虽然现在我们这个测试结果棒棒哒
<5-11,Sheldon>Although right now ours is testing off the charts

180
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:16,720
<5-11,Sheldon>而你的那个正泡在自己的排泄物里
<5-11,Sheldon>while yours is floating around in its own waste.

182
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,740
<5-12,Bernadette>你真的要拿我的人类宝宝
<5-12,Bernadette>Are you actually comparing my human baby

184
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,360
<5-12,Bernadette>跟你装在器皿里的脑细胞比吗
<5-12,Bernadette>to your brain in a bowl?

185
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:25,770
<5-13,Sheldon>不然你以为我让你
<5-13,Sheldon>Well, I didn't make you waddle up

186
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:28,360
<5-13,Sheldon>辛苦爬四层楼上来是为了什么
<5-13,Sheldon>four flights of stairs for the heck of it.

187
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:32,190
<5-14,Bernadette>你知道我宝宝有功能完备的器官
<5-14,Bernadette>You do realize my baby has functioning organs

188
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,750
<5-14,Bernadette>还能识别声音吧
<5-14,Bernadette>and can recognize voices.

189
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:36,790
<5-15,Sheldon>知道啊  但我们的可以在背景噪音中
<5-15,Sheldon>Yeah, but ours can recognize a specific data stream

190
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,470
<5-15,Sheldon>识别出特定的数据流
<5-15,Sheldon>among background noise.

191
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:42,160
<5-16,Bernadette>我的有发育完全的免疫系统
<5-16,Bernadette>Mine has a fully developed immune system.

192
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,770
<5-17,Sheldon>我们的不需要免疫系统
<5-17,Sheldon>Ours doesn't need an immune system

193
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:47,110
<5-17,Sheldon>因为它住在先进的德国制细胞培养器里
<5-17,Sheldon>because it lives in a state-of-the-art German incubator.

194
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:48,310
<5-18,Amy>谢尔顿  别说了
<5-18,Amy>Sheldon, that's enough.

195
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,750
<5-18,Amy>不要  好吧
<5-18,Amy>Oh, yeah, no, fine.

196
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,630
<5-19,Sheldon>我们不如承认两个作品
<5-19,Sheldon>Let's just agree that both creations

197
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:53,170
<5-19,Sheldon>都有各自独特的地方
<5-19,Sheldon>are special in their own way

198
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:55,610
<5-19,Sheldon>试图对比这两者是愚蠢的行为
<5-19,Sheldon>and it is foolish to try and compare them.

199
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:57,770
<5-19,Sheldon>然而我们的作品不需要靠跟霍华德上床才有
<5-19,Sheldon>Although, we didn't need to have sex with Howard for ours,

200
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:59,210
<5-19,Sheldon>所以还是我们赢
<5-19,Sheldon>so we win.

201
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,620
<6-1,Raj>这真有意思
<6-1,Raj>This is fun.

202
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,610
<6-1,Raj>我这辈子从没刷过马桶
<6-1,Raj>I have never cleaned a toilet before.

203
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:10,720
<6-2,Isabella>你在开玩笑吧
<6-2,Isabella>You're kidding.

204
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,410
<6-3,Raj>没有  从小就有一屋子佣人伺候我
<6-3,Raj>No, I grew up with a house full of servants

205
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:14,230
<6-3,Raj>现在我也有清洁阿姨
<6-3,Raj>and now I have a cleaning lady...

206
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:15,750
<6-3,Raj>她是一个很好的女人
<6-3,Raj>...who is a lovely woman

207
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,030
<6-3,Raj>我非常尊敬她
<6-3,Raj>who I have great respect for.

208
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,460
<6-4,Isabella>没关系  你可以有清洁阿姨啊
<6-4,Isabella>It's okay, you're allowed to have a cleaning lady.

209
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,230
<6-5,Raj>那就好  因为她还帮我遛狗
<6-5,Raj>Oh, good, because she also walks my dog,

210
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,890
<6-5,Raj>帮我买日用品  帮我剪头发
<6-5,Raj>buys my groceries and cuts my hair.

211
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,110
<6-6,Isabella>我觉得她的工作叫妈妈
<6-6,Isabella>I think that's called a mommy.

212
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,570
<6-7,Raj>原谅我..
<6-7,Raj>So, forgive me...

213
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:34,660
<6-7,Raj>八卦一下
<6-7,Raj>forgive me for being nosy,

214
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,290
<6-7,Raj>不过你那漂亮的橡胶手套下
<6-7,Raj>but is-is there a wedding ring

215
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:38,440
<6-7,Raj>有没有藏着一枚婚戒
<6-7,Raj>under those pretty rubber gloves?

216
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:42,670
<6-8,Isabella>没有  已经不戴很多年了
<6-8,Isabella>No, not for many years.

217
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:44,400
<6-9,Raj>所以你无拘无束吗
<6-9,Raj>Oh, so, you are unencumbered?

218
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,790
<6-10,Isabella>我和我儿子过
<6-10,Isabella>Just me and my son.

219
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,950
<6-11,Raj>我最爱孩子了  他多大
<6-11,Raj>I love kids, how old is he?

220
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:49,610
<6-12,Isabella>十九岁
<6-12,Isabella>Nineteen.

221
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,600
<6-13,Raj>这个年纪可爱
<6-13,Raj>That's a cute age.

222
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:56,240
<6-13,Raj>已经会干很多事了
<6-13,Raj>They can do so many things.

223
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:00,070
<6-14,Isabella>他在加州大学洛杉矶分校上学  要当律师
<6-14,Isabella>He's studying to be a lawyer at UCLA.

224
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:00,820
<6-15,Raj>太棒了
<6-15,Raj>That's wonderful.

225
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,900
<6-15,Raj>律师  我妹妹也是律师
<6-15,Raj>A lawyer, my sister's a lawyer.

226
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,740
<6-15,Raj>你瞧啊  我们有共同点了呢
<6-15,Raj>Look at that, we have something in common.

227
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,940
<6-16,Isabella>大概是有吧
<6-16,Isabella>Yeah, I guess we do.

228
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:10,520
<6-17,Raj>也许我们还有别的共同点呢
<6-17,Raj>Maybe there are other things we have in common.

229
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,930
<6-17,Raj>共同用餐时间  你爱吃饭吗
<6-17,Raj>C-Come dinnertime, do you enjoy eating food?

230
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,970
<6-18,Isabella>拉杰什
<6-18,Isabella>Ay, Rajesh,

231
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:18,970
<6-18,Isabella>你是个好人  不过

<6-24,Isabella>晚安
<6-24,Isabella>Good night.

242
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:46,790
<6-22,Isabella>说不好
<6-22,Isabella>I don't know,

243
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:49,950
<6-23,Raj>也许是除尿香饼气味闻嗨了
<6-23,Raj>maybe it's the fumes from the urinal cakes,

244
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:53,670
<6-23,Raj>可我觉得我们之间有点什么
<6-23,Raj>but I feel like something is happening between us.

245
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,900
<6-24,Isabella>晚安  拉杰什
<6-24,Isabella>Good night, Rajesh.

247
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,220
<6-25,Raj>我告诉你  每次我来到这里
<6-25,Raj>But just know, every time I come in here,

248
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,890
<6-25,Raj>都会想起你的
<6-25,Raj>I'll be thinking of you.

249
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:09,600
<7-1,Sheldon>你来看看这个
<7-1,Sheldon>Would you look at that?

250
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,440
<7-1,Sheldon>我们给它的画面带45%的白噪音
<7-1,Sheldon>The image we gave it was 45% white noise,

251
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,470
<7-1,Sheldon>可它还是完成了重建
<7-1,Sheldon>and it still managed to reconstruct it.

252
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,140
<7-2,Amy>我从来没看过这种结果
<7-2,Amy>I've never seen results like this before.

253
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,460
<7-3,Sheldon>我们回家的时候必须去买磁贴了
<7-3,Sheldon>Yeah, we need to stop for magnets on the way home;

254
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,740
<7-3,Sheldon>把这报告妥妥地吸冰箱上
<7-3,Sheldon>this is going right on the fridge.

255
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:23,000
<7-4,Amy>参与了这个高不高兴
<7-4,Amy>Aren't you glad you participated in this?

256
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,090
<7-5,Sheldon>高兴
<7-5,Sheldon>Oh, I am.

257
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,740
<7-5,Sheldon>你知道下一步该做什么吧
<7-5,Sheldon>And you realize what the next step is?

258
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:28,280
<7-6,Amy>培养第二份
<7-6,Amy>Set up a second culture

259
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,290
<7-6,Amy>尝试重复我们的结果
<7-6,Amy>and try to replicate our results.

260
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:31,920
<7-7,Sheldon>不是
<7-7,Sheldon>Uh, no.

261
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,440
<7-7,Sheldon>我们把那扇门锁好
<7-7,Sheldon>We lock that door,

262
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,800
<7-7,Sheldon>内裤往下拉  开始造个孩子
<7-7,Sheldon>lower our underpants a little and make a baby.

263
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:47,450
<7-8,Amy>造孩子  你在说什么
<7-8,Amy>Make a baby? What are you talking about?

264
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:50,660
<7-9,Sheldon>很明显  我们俩人的DNA结合无与伦比
<7-9,Sheldon>Clearly the combination of our DNA is exceptional.

265
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:54,690
<7-9,Sheldon>我们孩子也许是人类进化下一步的开端
<7-9,Sheldon>Our child could be the next step in the evolution of mankind.

266
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:57,720
<7-9,Sheldon>所有幼儿园都会任我们挑选
<7-9,Sheldon>We... we'll be able to get into any preschool we want!

267
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:00,420
<7-10,Amy>谢尔顿  我还没准备好要孩子
<7-10,Amy>Sh-Sheldon, I'm not ready to have a baby.

268
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:03,640
<7-11,Sheldon>你准备好了  我算着你的生理周期呢
<7-11,Sheldon>Oh, yes, you are! I track your cycle.

269
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:06,250
<7-11,Sheldon>在接下来的36小时内  你就像黑土地一样
<7-11,Sheldon>For the next 36 hours you're as fertile

270
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,940
<7-11,Sheldon>只要撒种啥都往出结
<7-11,Sheldon>as a manure-covered wheat field.

271
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:13,020
<7-12,Amy>我能清楚地感觉到
<7-12,Amy>Wow. I-I can actually feel

272
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,920
<7-12,Amy>我的卵子被吓得爬回卵巢了
<7-12,Amy>the egg crawling its way back up.

273
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:18,960
<7-12,Amy>我不懂了
<7-12,Amy>I don't understand.

274
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,510
<7-13,Sheldon>我以为你跟我生育子女会很高兴呢
<7-13,Sheldon>I thought you'd be thrilled to procreate with me.

275
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,730
<7-14,Amy>但不是现在
<7-14,Amy>Not right now.

276
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:25,330
<7-15,Sheldon>我明白了
<7-15,Sheldon>Oh, I see what's happening here.

277
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:27,710
<7-15,Sheldon>你在跟我玩欲擒故纵
<7-15,Sheldon>You're playing hard to get.

278
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,490
<7-16,Amy>我什么都没玩
<7-16,Amy>I'm not playing anything.

279
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,920
<7-16,Amy>我们今天不会造孩子的
<7-16,Amy>We're not making a baby today.

280
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,800
<7-16,Amy>好吧
<7-16,Amy>Very well.

281
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,040
<7-17,Sheldon>哎呦喂  瞧宝宝我笨手笨脚的
<7-17,Sheldon>Oops, how clumsy of me.

282
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,500
<7-17,Sheldon>你瞧好了  我来捡
<7-17,Sheldon>You know what? Let me get that.

283
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:53,830
<7-17,Sheldon>你去哪呀
<7-17,Sheldon>Where are you going?

284
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:54,520
<7-17,Sheldon>我...
<7-17,Sheldon>I...

285
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,550
<7-17,Sheldon>你到底看没看我的屁屁
<7-17,Sheldon>Did you even look at my bottom?

286
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:04,550
<8-1,Raj>欢迎
<8-1,Raj>Welcome.

287
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,440
<8-2,Isabella>这是干什么
<8-2,Isabella>What is this?

288
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,730
<8-3,Raj>你说你没时间出去吃饭
<8-3,Raj>Oh, well, you said you didn't have time to go out for dinner,

289
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:12,360
<8-3,Raj>所以我想  我们可以在这里吃
<8-3,Raj>so I thought we could have one right here.

290
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,020
<8-4,Isabella>-拉杰什  -来嘛
<8-4,Isabella>- Oh, Rajesh... - Oh, come on!

291
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,560
<8-4,Isabella>我们是在观测室里
<8-4,Isabella>We're in the telescope room!

292
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,140
<8-5,Raj>跟在星空下用餐是一样的
<8-5,Raj>It'll be like dining under the stars.

293
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,970
<8-5,Raj>你看到这两个0了吗
<8-5,Raj>Y-You see this, uh, double zero?

294
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:23,700
<8-5,Raj>等变成"01"时  说明星星在闪
<8-5,Raj>When it says "01," That means it's twinkling.

295
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,390
<8-5,Raj>有时候得等一会儿
<8-5,Raj>Sometimes it takes a while.

296
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,570
<8-6,Isabella>拉杰什  这确实很让人动心
<8-6,Isabella>Rajesh, this is so sweet,

297
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:36,130
<8-6,Isabella>不过你也知道   我还在工作
<8-6,Isabella>but you... you know I'm working.

298
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,070
<8-7,Raj>所以我已经把这里  还有整条走廊的
<8-7,Raj>That's why I already cleaned up in here

299
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:40,640
<8-7,Raj>所有房间  都打扫干净了
<8-7,Raj>and all the other rooms in the hall.

300
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,300
<8-8,Isabella>这样我的确是有点空闲时间了
<8-8,Isabella>Well, I suppose that gives me a little time.

301
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,840
<8-9,Raj>请坐吧
<8-9,Raj>Oh, please sit!

302
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:50,370
<8-9,Raj>我还给你做了你的家乡菜
<8-9,Raj>I tried to cook you a meal from your homeland.

303
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,540
<8-10,Isabella>真的吗
<8-10,Isabella>Oh, really?

304
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,790
<8-10,Isabella>你做了古巴菜吗
<8-10,Isabella>You made Cuban food?

305
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:58,520
<8-11,Raj>这就要看古巴有没有卖墨西哥菜了
<8-11,Raj>That depends-- do they have Mexican food in Cuba?

307
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,940
<9-1,Penny>他说"造个孩子"
<9-1,Penny>Now, when he said "Make a baby""

308
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:07,690
<9-1,Penny>有没有可能是用乐高玩具拼一个
<9-1,Penny>is it possible he meant out of Legos?

309
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:10,040
<9-2,Amy>不是  他说的很露骨
<9-2,Amy>No. He was explicit.

310
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,450
<9-2,Amy>多余又异常露骨
<9-2,Amy>Needlessly and freakishly explicit.

311
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:16,120
<9-3,Leonard>他要孩子干嘛用
<9-3,Leonard>Why does he need a baby?

312
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,960
<9-3,Leonard>他自己不就全身没毛  外加一股爽身粉味吗
<9-3,Leonard>He's already hairless and smells like talcum powder.

313
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,310
<9-4,Penny>你俩真的能生出什么
<9-4,Penny>Could you two really have some sort of

314
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:24,200
<9-4,Penny>超级聪明的孩子吗
<9-4,Penny>super-intelligent child?

315
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,880
<9-5,Amy>遗传是有影响
<9-5,Amy>Well, there is a genetic component,

316
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,650
<9-5,Amy>但并不能保证什么
<9-5,Amy>but that doesn't guarantee anything.

317
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:28,930
<9-6,Leonard>没错  谢尔顿的老爸
<9-6,Leonard>That's true. Sheldon's father

318
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:31,380
<9-6,Leonard>曾经和仙人掌大吵一架
<9-6,Leonard>once picked a fight with a cactus.

319
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:33,800
<9-7,Penny>但那只是他地球上的养父母
<9-7,Penny>Yeah, but that's just his Earth parents.

320
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,720
<9-7,Penny>我们对送他来地球的亲生爹妈一无所知
<9-7,Penny>We don't know anything about the ones that sent him here.

321
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:42,420
<9-8,Leonard>至少知道他们够聪明  知道把他送走
<9-8,Leonard>Well, we know they were smart enough to send him away.

322
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,500
<9-9,Amy>注意点  你们说的是我爱的
<9-9,Amy>Hey, you're talking about the person I love

323
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,800
<9-9,Amy>而且躲了三小时的男人
<9-9,Amy>and have been avoiding for the past three hours.

324
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,700
<9-9,Amy>有没搞错
<9-9,Amy>Aw, man.

325
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,590
<9-10,Penny>这下谢尔顿性福啦
<9-10,Penny>Sheldon gonna get some.

326
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,380
<9-11,Leonard>无论二号门后面是什么噩梦
<9-11,Leonard>Well, have fun with whatever nightmare's

327
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,620
<9-11,Leonard>都祝你玩得愉快
<9-11,Leonard>behind door number two.

328
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,820
<9-12,Sheldon>美人你好啊
<9-12,Sheldon>Well, hello.

329
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:23,720
<9-13,Amy>你好
<9-13,Amy>Hello.

330
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:26,700
<9-14,Sheldon>来杯白兰地如何
<9-14,Sheldon>Would you care for a brandy?

331
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,930
<9-15,Amy>还是算了
<9-15,Amy>I don't think so.

332
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:30,030
<9-16,Sheldon>真聪明  难喝死了
<9-16,Sheldon>Good choice, it's disgusting.

333
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:35,100
<9-17,Amy>谢尔顿  请你别再色诱我了
<9-17,Amy>Sheldon, please stop trying to seduce me.

334
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,770
<9-17,Amy>谁在色诱你了
<9-17,Amy>Who's trying to seduce you?

335
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:40,050
<9-18,Sheldon>工作一天后  我总是会听舒缓的爵士乐
<9-18,Sheldon>After a long day I always turn on smooth jazz

336
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:42,980
<9-18,Sheldon>并在大腿内侧喷上鹿麝香
<9-18,Sheldon>and spray deer musk on my inner thighs.

338
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:49,410
<9-19,Amy>就觉得这里的味道好像宠物乐园
<9-19,Amy>I thought it smelled like a petting zoo in here.

339
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,430
<9-20,Sheldon>有什么你想"宠爱"一番的吗
<9-20,Sheldon>Anything you'd like to pet?

340
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:55,460
<9-20,Sheldon>别碰我的头发  用了发胶
<9-20,Sheldon>Not my hair. There's a lot of goop in it.

341
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,840
<9-21,Amy>我真是受够了
<9-21,Amy>Okay, I've had enough.

342
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:01,080
<9-22,Sheldon>艾米  回来
<9-22,Sheldon>Amy, come back.

343
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,940
<9-22,Sheldon>我不会开生蚝[壮阳用]
<9-22,Sheldon>I don't know how to open the oysters.

344
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,820
<10-1,Raj>你刚来美国时
<10-1,Raj>So, um, what surprised you the most

345
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,470
<10-1,Raj>什么最让你吃惊
<10-1,Raj>when you first came to America?

346
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:13,670
<10-2,Isabella>我想应该是为什么那么多人都在乎
<10-2,Isabella>Well, I suppose how much people care

347
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:15,950
<10-2,Isabella>奥普拉最喜欢什么
<10-2,Isabella>about Oprah's favorite things.

348
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,070
<10-3,Raj>我当时也这样想
<10-3,Raj>I thought that, too.

349
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:19,620
<10-3,Raj>然后我买了第一台华夫饼机
<10-3,Raj>But then I got my first waffle maker

350
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,730
<10-3,Raj>从此再没质疑过她的推荐
<10-3,Raj>and never questioned her again.

351
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,280
<10-4,Isabella>这个星期天我休息
<10-4,Isabella>You know, I do have some time off this Sunday

<10-5,Howard>抱歉  我打扰你们了吗
<10-5,Howard>Oh, sorry. Am I interrupting?

<10-10,Howard>拉杰提到过你
<10-10,Howard>Raj told us about you.

<10-10,Howard>Hey! Free toilet paper!

360
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,760
<10-11,Isabella>你跟他说我是天文学家吗
<10-11,Isabella>You told him I was an astronomer?

361
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:50,890
<10-13,Isabella>我懂

364
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,810
<10-15,Isabella>我不必在以我为耻的男人身上浪费时间
<10-15,Isabella>I don't have to waste my time with someone who's embarrassed by me.

365
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:03,750
<10-16,Howard>这个不用还了  对吗
<10-16,Howard>I can keep this, right?

<10-19,Raj>说实话  我以为我不介意你的工作
<10-19,Raj>Honestly, I-I didn't think your job would bother me,

371
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:16,440
<10-19,Raj>但看来我介意
<10-19,Raj>but I guess it did.

372
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,210
<10-19,Raj>我为自己感到羞愧
<10-19,Raj>And I hate myself for that.

373
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:19,610
<10-19,Raj>但我也有很多事
<10-19,Raj>But there's a lot of things about me

374
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:21,510
<10-19,Raj>会让你觉得很没面子
<10-19,Raj>that would totally embarrass you.

375
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:22,940
<10-20,Isabella>我不信
<10-20,Isabella>I doubt that.

376
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,090
<10-21,Raj>准备好以我为耻吧
<10-21,Raj>Well, prepare to be mortified.

377
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,860
<10-21,Raj>我嘴对嘴喂我的狗吃东西
<10-21,Raj>I let my dog eat food out of my mouth,

378
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:30,730
<10-21,Raj>不是因为它喜欢  而是因为我喜欢
<10-21,Raj>not because she likes it but because I do.

379
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:32,160
<10-21,Raj>还有  我知道蝴蝶很美
<10-21,Raj>Also, I know they're pretty,

380
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,420
<10-21,Raj>但我怕它们
<10-21,Raj>but I'm scared of butterflies.

381
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,640
<10-22,Howard>抱歉  我只是路过
<10-22,Howard>Sorry, just passing through.

382
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,520
<10-22,Howard>我想这是你推车上掉下来的
<10-22,Howard>I think this fell off your cart.

383
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,260
<10-23,Raj>拜托  你怎么说
<10-23,Raj>Come on. What do you say?

384
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,020
<10-23,Raj>让我补偿你吧
<10-23,Raj>Let me make it up to you.

385
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,080
<10-24,Isabella>你很锲而不舍
<10-24,Isabella>You're very persistent.

386
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,110
<10-25,Raj>我就会死皮赖脸这一招
<10-25,Raj>It's my one move.

387
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,830
<10-25,Raj>好吧

<10-28,Isabella>如果你喜欢  可以吃巴基斯坦菜
<10-28,Isabella>It can be Pakistani food, if you like.

393
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:05,700
<10-30,Isabella>现在你明白我的感受了吧
<10-30,Isabella>And now you know how it feels.

<11-1,Penny>那么  你的性趣有被挑起哪怕一点点吗
<11-1,Penny>So, were you turned on even a little bit?

396
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:18,230
<11-2,Amy>感觉就像加入了狗仔队的皮威赫曼在泡你
<11-2,Amy>It was like being hit on by Rat Pack Pee-wee Herman.

00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:28,680
<11-5,Sheldon>我也不想这样

402
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,350
<11-5,Sheldon>但你让我别无选择
<11-5,Sheldon>But you have left me no choice

403
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,380
<11-5,Sheldon>唯有献上人类已知的

<11-7,Sheldon>你们俩看得情欲高涨了  对吗
<11-7,Sheldon>You guys are aroused, right?
