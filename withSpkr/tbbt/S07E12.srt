00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,660
<1-3,Amy>大家能放下手机
<1-3,Amy>Can we maybe put the phones down

4
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,090
<1-3,Amy>来点人类的真实交流吗
<1-3,Amy>and have an actual human conversation?

<1-4,Sheldon>可以是可以
<1-4,Sheldon>We can,

<1-4,Sheldon>we don't have to.

8
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:36,860
<1-5,Penny>各位
<1-5,Penny>Guys, guys,

9
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:38,000
<1-5,Penny>-我要说一件你们不会信的事  -什么事
<1-5,Penny>- you're never gonna believe this. - What happened?

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,150
<1-5,Penny>我要在电视剧上露脸啦
<1-5,Penny>I just got a part on a TV show!

14
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:47,710
<1-12,Amy>是哪部电视剧
<1-12,Amy>What's the show?

15
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:50,450
<1-13,Penny>叫海军罪案小卖部
<1-13,Penny>Um, NC...II...

17
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,020
<1-13,Penny>还是海军罪案性病处之类的
<1-13,Penny>or, you know, NCSTD... I don't know,

18
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:56,990
<1-13,Penny>反正就是剧名全是字母的剧啦
<1-13,Penny>it's-it's the one with the letters and I'm gonna be on it!

19
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:58,610
<1-14,Leonard>-真是太好了  -对啊
<1-14,Leonard>- That's amazing. - Yeah.

20
00:00:58,610 --> 00:00:59,470
<1-16,Howard>你演什么角色
<1-16,Howard>What's your part?

21
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:01,190
<1-17,Penny>我演餐厅里的客人
<1-17,Penny>Um, I play a customer in a diner

22
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:02,870
<1-17,Penny>然后跟男主马克·哈蒙调情
<1-17,Penny>and I flirt with Mark Harmon.

23
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:04,430
<1-18,Raj>马克·哈蒙
<1-18,Raj>Ooh, Mark Harmon,

24
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,500
<1-18,Raj>他是个男神啊
<1-18,Raj>he's a dreamboat.

25
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,180
<1-19,Leonard>就调情戏而已吗
<1-19,Leonard>So I-it's just flirting?

26
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,360
<1-20,Penny>是啊  怎么了吗
<1-20,Penny>Well, yeah. Why?

27
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,040
<1-21,Leonard>没怎么
<1-21,Leonard>Uh, no reason.

28
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,380
<1-21,Leonard>我只是觉得有些事
<1-21,Leonard>I just think it's sexier when things are

29
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:14,100
<1-21,Leonard>在想象时最美
<1-21,Leonard>left to the imagination.

30
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,630
<1-22,Amy>此言大大差矣
<1-22,Amy>He's wrong.

32
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,390
<1-22,Amy>本字幕由人人影视字幕组翻译
<1-22,Amy>禁止用作任何商业盈利行为

36
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,710
<1-22,Amy>生活大爆炸
<1-22,Amy>第七季  第十二集

37
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,950
<2-1,Raj>我看到一篇研究  说养狗的男人
<2-1,Raj>So I-I read a study that says a man with a dog

38
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,610
<2-1,Raj>要到女生电话的几率比不养狗的高三倍
<2-1,Raj>is three times more likely to get a woman's phone number.

39
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,580
<2-2,Leonard>就算那让狗舔舌头上的花生酱
<2-2,Leonard>Is it true even when the man lets his dog

40
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:54,140
<2-2,Leonard>这男性几率也成立吗
<2-2,Leonard>lick peanut butter off his tongue?

41
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,580
<2-3,Raj>为何会不成立
<2-3,Raj>I don't see why not.

42
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:59,120
<2-4,Howard>如果你真的对女人这么饥渴
<2-4,Howard>If you're really desperate to meet women

43
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,290
<2-4,Howard>又喜欢别人从你嘴里吃东西
<2-4,Howard>and like having food eaten out of your mouth,

44
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,010
<2-4,Howard>我可以介绍我妈给你
<2-4,Howard>I could set you up with my mom.

45
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,290
<2-5,Sheldon>这有什么好笑
<2-5,Sheldon>Why is that funny?

46
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,270
<2-5,Sheldon>这超不卫生
<2-5,Sheldon>That's just unhygienic.

47
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:12,530
<2-6,Leonard>玩笑而已
<2-6,Leonard>It's a joke.

48
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:14,420
<2-6,Leonard>我不这么认为
<2-6,Leonard>I don't think so.

49
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,240
<2-7,Sheldon>我认为一个笑话
<2-7,Sheldon>I believe that a joke

50
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,650
<2-7,Sheldon>是简短的口头小故事
<2-7,Sheldon>is a brief oral narrative

51
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:19,990
<2-7,Sheldon>带有着超幽默的剧情反转
<2-7,Sheldon>with a climactic humorous twist.

52
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:23,150
<2-7,Sheldon>举个例子  沃罗威茨的母亲超肥
<2-7,Sheldon>For example, uh, Wolowitz's mother is so fat

53
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:25,440
<2-7,Sheldon>她决定节食
<2-7,Sheldon>that she decided to go on a diet...

54
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,110
<2-7,Sheldon>或锻炼  或双管齐下
<2-7,Sheldon>or exercise, or both.

55
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:32,280
<2-7,Sheldon>听到没
<2-7,Sheldon>See?

56
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,930
<2-7,Sheldon>反转就是人们通常死性不改
<2-7,Sheldon>The twist is that people don't usually change.

57
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:40,570
<2-7,Sheldon>就是不会改嘛
<2-7,Sheldon>Well, they don't.

58
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:42,850
<2-8,Penny>各位  别忘了
<2-8,Penny>Hey, guys, don't forget,

59
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:44,740
<2-8,Penny>明晚我参演的电视就播出啦
<2-8,Penny>my episode's on TV tomorrow night.

60
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,230
<2-10,Raj>-我们会去看的  -要带什么吃的吗
<2-10,Raj>- We'll be there. - Can we bring anything?

61
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:47,430
<2-11,Penny>你真是太好了
<2-11,Penny>Oh, that's so sweet of you,

62
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,060
<2-11,Penny>但我打算从这里顺点吃的回去
<2-11,Penny>but I was gonna steal food from here.

63
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:51,850
<2-11,Penny>你懂  我请客嘛
<2-11,Penny>You know... my treat.

64
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:53,920
<2-12,Sheldon>慢着  如果霍华德的母亲也去
<2-12,Sheldon>Wait, if Howard's mother is coming,

65
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,280
<2-12,Sheldon>你就应该还顺点弹珠
<2-12,Sheldon>then you should also steal marbles.

66
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,640
<2-12,Sheldon>因为她有肥胖症
<2-12,Sheldon>Because she's obese,

67
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,960
<2-12,Sheldon>河马也超肥
<2-12,Sheldon>and hippos are obese,

68
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,370
<2-12,Sheldon>而在受欢迎的桌游"饥饿河马"中
<2-12,Sheldon>and in the popular board game "Hungry Hungry Hippos,"

69
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:07,230
<2-12,Sheldon>它们吃弹珠
<2-12,Sheldon>they eat marbles.

70
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,750
<2-12,Sheldon>也许我该对你们说傻逼点的笑话
<2-12,Sheldon>Maybe I need to dumb these down for you.

71
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,260
<3-1,Sheldon>莱纳德  你觉得我好笑吗
<3-1,Sheldon>Leonard, do you think I'm funny?

72
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,840
<3-1,Sheldon>不
<3-1,Sheldon>No.

73
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,190
<3-2,Leonard>你自己觉得呢
<3-2,Leonard>Do you?

74
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:27,970
<3-3,Sheldon>我觉得我超级好笑
<3-3,Sheldon>I think I'm hysterical.

75
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,110
<3-4,Leonard>我收回刚才这句
<3-4,Leonard>I take it back.

76
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:32,290
<3-4,Leonard>你这句的确好笑
<3-4,Leonard>That was funny.

77
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,810
<3-5,Sheldon>但哲学家亨利·柏格林说
<3-5,Sheldon>The philosopher Henri Bergson says

78
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:40,000
<3-5,Sheldon>当人类表现得和物体一样时  就会很好笑
<3-5,Sheldon>it's funny when a human being behaves like an object.

79
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,120
<3-6,Leonard>他这段子在相声秀上肯定火啊
<3-6,Leonard>I bet that bit killed at The Chuckle Hut.

80
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,140
<3-7,Sheldon>他不表演单口相声
<3-7,Sheldon>Oh, he didn't perform stand-up comedy,

81
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,210
<3-7,Sheldon>他是个哲学家
<3-7,Sheldon>he was a philosopher.

82
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,730
<3-8,Leonard>我想我们已经找到你不好笑的问题所在了
<3-8,Leonard>You know, I think we're zeroing in on your problem.

83
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:56,030
<3-9,Sheldon>也许我应该花点时间
<3-9,Sheldon>Perhaps I'll spend some time

84
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:58,590
<3-9,Sheldon>形成统一的喜剧理论
<3-9,Sheldon>developing a unified theory of comedy,

85
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,720
<3-9,Sheldon>可以让我随时激发
<3-9,Sheldon>which will allow me to elicit laughter

86
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,370
<3-9,Sheldon>任何人的笑声
<3-9,Sheldon>from anyone at any time.

87
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:03,720
<3-9,Sheldon>除非取悦对象是德国人
<3-9,Sheldon>Unless they're German,

88
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,210
<3-9,Sheldon>因为他们的笑点太高了
<3-9,Sheldon>'cause that's a tough crowd.

89
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:10,220
<3-10,Leonard>你要致力于让别人与你共欢笑吗
<3-10,Leonard>Are you set on people laughing with you?

90
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:13,010
<3-10,Leonard>因为如果你对被嘲笑没意见的话...
<3-10,Leonard>'Cause if you're cool with at you...

91
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,020
<3-11,Sheldon>我不明白
<3-11,Sheldon>I don't get it.

92
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,450
<4-1,Bernadette>拉杰  你说你今晚会带个伴
<4-1,Bernadette>Raj, when you said you were gonna bring a date

93
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:25,780
<4-1,Bernadette>去看佩妮的电视剧
<4-1,Bernadette>to watch Penny's thing tonight,

94
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,590
<4-1,Bernadette>我没想到你指的是斯图尔特
<4-1,Bernadette>I didn't think you meant Stuart.

95
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:30,460
<4-1,Bernadette>是吗
<4-1,Bernadette>Really?

96
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,920
<4-2,Howard>我从来没想过
<4-2,Howard>I never for a second

97
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,780
<4-2,Howard>还有可能是其他人
<4-2,Howard>thought it'd be anything else.

98
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:37,550
<4-3,Raj>我昨晚差点泡到个妞  但结果还是吹了
<4-3,Raj>I almost met someone last night, but I blew it.

99
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:38,790
<4-3,Raj>我在遛小桂子
<4-3,Raj>I was walking Cinnamon

100
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,310
<4-3,Raj>那个女生自我介绍
<4-3,Raj>and this girl introduced herself,

101
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,750
<4-3,Raj>她太可爱了  我慌了
<4-3,Raj>but she was so cute I panicked

102
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,400
<4-3,Raj>我说  比起交谈
<4-3,Raj>and said, "Wouldn't it be easier

103
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,910
<4-3,Raj>我们互相闻菊花不是更简单吗
<4-3,Raj>if instead of talking we could just sniff each other's butts?"

104
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:51,260
<4-4,Bernadette>斯图尔特也有独特的可爱之处
<4-4,Bernadette>Well, Stuart's cute in his own way.

105
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:52,350
<4-5,Stuart>我还是宝宝时
<4-5,Stuart>When I was a baby,

106
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,930
<4-5,Stuart>我妈妈管我叫她的小负鼠
<4-5,Stuart>my mother called me her little possum.

107
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:56,580
<4-6,Raj>负鼠可爱吗
<4-6,Raj>Are possums cute?

108
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,560
<4-7,Stuart>简直是魔鬼
<4-7,Stuart>Not at all.

109
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,550
<4-8,Howard>如果你这么害怕
<4-8,Howard>If you're so intimidated

110
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,470
<4-8,Howard>和美女交谈
<4-8,Howard>by talking to attractive girls,

111
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:05,550
<4-8,Howard>也许你应该练习和普通人说话
<4-8,Howard>maybe you should practice by talking to regular people.

112
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:08,110
<4-9,Raj>你是说肥猪和恐龙妹吗
<4-9,Raj>You mean like fatties and uggos?

113
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,370
<4-10,Bernadette>或者干脆都别说话了
<4-10,Bernadette>Or maybe just stop talking.

114
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:13,320
<4-10,Bernadette>我是认真的
<4-10,Bernadette>I'm serious.

115
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,220
<4-11,Howard>去商场  随便找个人说话当练习
<4-11,Howard>Go to the mall, talk to anybody, practice--

116
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,950
<4-11,Howard>这样的话  等你真有机会跟一个美女说话
<4-11,Howard>that way, when you eventually do talk to a cute girl,

117
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,530
<4-11,Howard>就不会觉得那么害怕了
<4-11,Howard>it won't be so scary.

118
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:22,360
<4-12,Bernadette>或者继续跟负鼠约会算了
<4-12,Bernadette>Or just keep dating the possum.

119
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,640
<5-1,Voice on television>帕尔萨没有那方面的资源
<5-1,Voice on television>Parsa doesn't have those kind of resources.

120
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,520
<5-2,Second voice>不  所以他让艾琳·佩斯重发一遍
<5-2,Second voice>No, and that's why he had Erin Pace rewire it...

121
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,810
<5-3,Leonard>我真为你感到骄傲
<5-3,Leonard>I'm so proud of you.

122
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:34,850
<5-4,Penny>-我都还没有出场呢  -我知道
<5-4,Penny>- We haven't even gotten to my scene yet. - I know,

123
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:36,070
<5-5,Leonard>但你即将成为电视明星
<5-5,Leonard>but you're going to be a TV star

124
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:39,250
<5-5,Leonard>而你还没有甩掉我  这需要莫大的勇气啊
<5-5,Leonard>and you haven't left me yet. That takes guts.

125
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,220
<5-6,Sheldon>我不知道你感觉如何
<5-6,Sheldon>I don't know about you,

126
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:44,340
<5-6,Sheldon>-但这让我感到非常不舒服  -为什么
<5-6,Sheldon>- but I'm very uncomfortable with all this. - Why?

127
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,320
<5-8,Sheldon>我之前从来没看过这个剧
<5-8,Sheldon>I've never seen this show before

128
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,720
<5-8,Sheldon>而现在居然让我从246集看起
<5-8,Sheldon>and now I'm starting with episode 246?

129
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,780
<5-8,Sheldon>这有违自然规律
<5-8,Sheldon>It's unnatural.

130
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,520
<5-9,Amy>你就把前面245集当是前传嘛
<5-9,Amy>Just think of the first 245 as the prequel.

131
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:00,170
<5-10,Sheldon>好吧
<5-10,Sheldon>All right.

132
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:02,810
<5-11,Penny>好啦  各位  我要出场啦
<5-11,Penny>Okay, shh. Guys, guys, this is it.

133
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:05,540
<5-12,Man on TV>现在就剩咱俩了  小姑娘
<5-12,Man on TV>I guess it's you and me, kid.

134
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:06,730
<5-13,Mark Harmon on TV>你有何目的
<5-13,Mark Harmon on TV>What are you doing?

135
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:08,410
<5-14,Woman on TV>我是来讲和的
<5-14,Woman on TV>I'm trying to make peace.

136
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,740
<5-16,Woman on TV>-我们没事啊  -很好
<5-16,Woman on TV>- We're good. - Good.

137
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,660
<5-18,Penny>-真的吗  -开什么玩笑
<5-18,Penny>- Really? Because... - Are you kidding me?

138
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,860
<5-19,Leonard>怎么了
<5-19,Leonard>What's wrong?

139
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,280
<5-20,Penny>餐厅的场戏没了
<5-20,Penny>Well... the diner scene.

140
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,630
<5-20,Penny>我餐厅那场戏呢
<5-20,Penny>Where's my diner scene?

141
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:16,500
<5-21,Sheldon>别问我
<5-21,Sheldon>Well, don't ask me.

142
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,020
<5-21,Sheldon>等我看完前传再说  我现在迷糊了
<5-21,Sheldon>Until I see the prequel, I'm lost.

143
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,110
<5-22,Penny>不对啊  应该有一场我和马克·哈蒙的对手戏
<5-22,Penny>No, there was supposed to be a big scene with me and Mark Harmon,

144
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:25,920
<5-23,Bernadette>-但不见了  -怎么会这样
<5-23,Bernadette>- but I-it's... gone. - What happened?

145
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,960
<5-24,Penny>一定是他们剪掉了
<5-24,Penny>They must've cut it.

146
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,000
<5-25,Leonard>可怜的佩妮
<5-25,Leonard>Oh, Penny...

147
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,270
<5-26,Howard>真为你感到惋惜
<5-26,Howard>I'm... I'm sorry.

148
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:34,080
<5-27,Raj>-太过分了  -我肯定你演得很棒
<5-27,Raj>- That stinks. - I'm sure you were great.

149
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,330
<5-28,Penny>这不合理啊
<5-28,Penny>This doesn't make any sense.

150
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:36,650
<5-28,Penny>我是说
<5-28,Penny>I mean, I...

151
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:39,330
<5-28,Penny>我以为自己演得很好  我...
<5-28,Penny>I thought I did a... a really good job, I...

152
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,040
<5-28,Penny>失陪一下
<5-28,Penny>Excuse me.

153
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:51,400
<5-29,Sheldon>我一直在学习如何逗人发笑
<5-29,Sheldon>I've been studying how to make people laugh.

154
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,920
<5-29,Sheldon>他们说喜剧就是
<5-29,Sheldon>They say that comedy

155
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:59,030
<5-29,Sheldon>悲剧加上时间
<5-29,Sheldon>is tragedy plus time.

156
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,900
<5-29,Sheldon>我们去逗她开心吧
<5-29,Sheldon>Let's tickle some ribs.

157
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,310
<6-1,Penny (on phone)>不  爸
<6-1,Penny (on phone)>No, Dad,

158
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,870
<6-1,Penny (on phone)>我不认为他们剪掉我的戏份
<6-1,Penny (on phone)>I don't think they cut me out of the show

159
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:11,170
<6-1,Penny (on phone)>是因为我太漂亮
<6-1,Penny (on phone)>because I was too pretty.

160
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:14,460
<6-1,Penny (on phone)>不要  我不用你亲自出马
<6-1,Penny (on phone)>No, I don't need you to come out

161
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:17,260
<6-1,Penny (on phone)>毒打马克·哈蒙一顿
<6-1,Penny (on phone)>and kick Mark Harmon's ass.

162
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,020
<6-1,Penny (on phone)>爸  我得挂了
<6-1,Penny (on phone)>Daddy, I gotta go.

163
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,970
<6-1,Penny (on phone)>我爱你  再见
<6-1,Penny (on phone)>I love you. Bye.

164
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,030
<6-2,Leonard>你还好吗
<6-2,Leonard>How you doing?

165
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:26,370
<6-3,Penny>家里都乱成一锅粥了
<6-3,Penny>Ugh, this is such a disaster.

166
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:28,560
<6-3,Penny>我父母把我所有亲戚都叫过来
<6-3,Penny>My parents had all my relatives over.

167
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,820
<6-3,Penny>他们还买了根六英尺长的三明治
<6-3,Penny>They got one of those six-foot sandwiches,

168
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:35,070
<6-3,Penny>还把我弟弟从戒毒所接出来一天
<6-3,Penny>and got my brother a day pass out of rehab and...

169
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,070
<6-3,Penny>现在他人不见了
<6-3,Penny>...now he's missing

170
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:39,630
<6-3,Penny>那超大根三明治也不见了
<6-3,Penny>and the sandwich is missing, and...

171
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:42,040
<6-3,Penny>他们可能已经到了墨西哥了吧
<6-3,Penny>They're probably in Mexico by now.

172
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,070
<6-3,Penny>真丢脸
<6-3,Penny>So humiliating.

173
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,810
<6-4,Leonard>你还是得到了那个角色
<6-4,Leonard>You still got the part.

174
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:47,400
<6-4,Leonard>那可是巨大的成就啊
<6-4,Leonard>That's a huge accomplishment.

175
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,720
<6-5,Penny>对  但这次本来会是我的突破
<6-5,Penny>Yeah, but this was supposed to be my break, okay?

176
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,190
<6-5,Penny>人们会在这剧中看见我
<6-5,Penny>People were gonna see me in this show

177
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:51,540
<6-5,Penny>然后会演变成更大的效应
<6-5,Penny>and it was gonna lead to bigger things.

178
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,080
<6-5,Penny>更多试镜  更多角色
<6-5,Penny>More auditions, more parts...

179
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,460
<6-5,Penny>而现在这些都不可能发生了
<6-5,Penny>Now none of that's gonna happen.

180
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,040
<6-6,Leonard>亲爱的  你在剧中不过就三句台词而已
<6-6,Leonard>Honey, you only had, like, three lines.

181
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,430
<6-6,Leonard>所以本来这些就不可能发生
<6-6,Leonard>That wasn't gonna happen anyway.

182
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:04,460
<6-7,Penny>-我信了你的邪  -拜托
<6-7,Penny>- Unbelievable. - Come on...

183
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,630
<6-8,Leonard>不  我不是那个意思
<6-8,Leonard>no, that's not what I meant.

184
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:07,600
<6-9,Penny>-那你是什么意思  -我不是...
<6-9,Penny>- Then what did you mean? - I don't...

185
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,020
<6-10,Leonard>有时候说话不一定非得要有意思
<6-10,Leonard>Look, you know, words don't always have to mean things.

186
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,440
<6-11,Penny>我觉得你是说你不相信我的实力
<6-11,Penny>I think you meant that you don't believe in me.

187
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,300
<6-12,Leonard>不是
<6-12,Leonard>Nope.

188
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:16,870
<6-12,Leonard>我可能不知道我刚是什么意思
<6-12,Leonard>I might not know what I-I meant,

189
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,770
<6-12,Leonard>但我知道我肯定没有那个意思
<6-12,Leonard>but I know that I didn't mean that.

190
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:21,100
<6-12,Leonard>我绝不会这样  不可能
<6-12,Leonard>Not this guy. Oh, no way.

191
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:22,780
<6-13,Penny>我要你  现在
<6-13,Penny>I want you, right now,

192
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:25,430
<6-13,Penny>-如实告诉我你真实的想法  -好的
<6-13,Penny>- to give me your 100% honest opinion. - Right.

193
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:27,130
<6-15,Penny>你到底认为我有没有能力
<6-15,Penny>Do you think I have what it takes

194
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:29,330
<6-15,Penny>-成为真正的女演员  -有
<6-15,Penny>to really make it as an actress? - Yes.

195
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:30,640
<6-17,Penny>所以你认为我能上电视
<6-17,Penny>So you think I'll be on TV

196
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,380
<6-17,Penny>拍电影  并且获奖吗
<6-17,Penny>and in movies and win awards.

197
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,700
<6-19,Penny>-说实话  -好  实话说
<6-19,Penny>- Honestly? - Yes, honestly.

198
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,070
<6-20,Leonard>我不这么认为
<6-20,Leonard>I don't.

199
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,320
<6-21,Penny>你怎么能这样说呢
<6-21,Penny>How could you say that?

200
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,110
<6-21,Penny>我不知道
<6-21,Penny>I don't know...

201
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:42,750
<6-22,Leonard>当你说"说实话"时  我脑子就不转了
<6-22,Leonard>I got all confused when you said "honestly".

202
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,290
<6-24,Leonard>我觉得你有演员天赋
<6-24,Leonard>Look, do I think that you are talented

203
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:49,380
<6-24,Leonard>你外表出众吗
<6-24,Leonard>and that you are beautiful?

204
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,930
<6-24,Leonard>我当然觉得
<6-24,Leonard>Of course I do.

205
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,000
<6-24,Leonard>但洛杉矶满大街都是有天赋
<6-24,Leonard>But isn't Los Angeles full of actresses

206
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,090
<6-24,Leonard>外表出众的女演员啊
<6-24,Leonard>who are just as talented, just as beautiful?

207
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,140
<6-24,Leonard>算了  这个晚点再说
<6-24,Leonard>All right, look... we'll come back to that.

208
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,720
<6-25,Penny>不  别停  继续说
<6-25,Penny>No, please. Don't stop, go on.

209
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,200
<6-25,Penny>告诉我  老娘这辈子就是服务员的命
<6-25,Penny>Tell me how I'm gonna be a waitress for the rest of my life.

210
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,010
<6-25,Penny>我可没这么说
<6-25,Penny>That is not what I said.

211
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:07,200
<6-26,Leonard>听着  我认为你很棒
<6-26,Leonard>Look, I think you're really good.

212
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,010
<6-26,Leonard>真心的
<6-26,Leonard>I truly do.

213
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:11,990
<6-26,Leonard>但是你奋斗的目标实在是太困难了
<6-26,Leonard>But this is an incredibly hard thing that you're shooting for.

214
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:15,210
<6-26,Leonard>我是说   普通人想成为成功演员的机会
<6-26,Leonard>I mean, the odds of anyone becoming a successful actor

215
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:17,700
<6-26,Leonard>实在是难于上青天啊
<6-26,Leonard>are like a million to one.

216
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,610
<6-27,Penny>谢谢你的"安慰"
<6-27,Penny>Wow, thank you.

217
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,910
<6-28,Leonard>早知道就让谢尔顿来了
<6-28,Leonard>Should've let Sheldon come.

218
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:34,670
<7-1,Sheldon>这倒挺有意思的
<7-1,Sheldon>This is interesting.

219
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:38,340
<7-1,Sheldon>有某些耍幽默方式的关键
<7-1,Sheldon>Apparently, a key component in some forms of humor

220
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,790
<7-1,Sheldon>就是要让人吓一跳
<7-1,Sheldon>is the element of surprise.

221
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:42,290
<7-2,Amy>有道理
<7-2,Amy>Well, that makes sense.

222
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,750
<7-2,Amy>前额皮质的主要功能就是
<7-2,Amy>The prefrontal cortex is responsible for

223
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,910
<7-2,Amy>计划和预测
<7-2,Amy>planning and anticipation,

224
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,480
<7-2,Amy>大脑受到损伤的病患会
<7-2,Amy>and patients with brain lesions on their...

225
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,130
<7-3,Sheldon>脑损伤
<7-3,Sheldon>Brain lesions!

226
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:56,930
<7-4,Amy>谢尔顿  你吓死我了
<7-4,Amy>Sheldon, you scared me.

227
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,710
<7-4,Amy>一点也不好笑
<7-4,Amy>That wasn't funny.

228
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:02,020
<7-5,Sheldon>我看是你的前额皮质被棍捅了吧
<7-5,Sheldon>Or maybe you have a stick up your prefrontal cortex.

229
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,120
<7-6,Amy>得了吧  你自以为读了几本书
<7-6,Amy>Okay, the notion that you can read a few books

230
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,820
<7-6,Amy>就能找出绝对的搞笑理论  也太荒谬了
<7-6,Amy>and come up with a definitive theory of comedy is absurd.

231
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:10,750
<7-6,Amy>真正的幽默是
<7-6,Amy>I mean, humor is

232
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,300
<7-6,Amy>神经上错综复杂的
<7-6,Amy>a complex neurological...

233
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:20,850
<7-6,Amy>-这个挺好笑的  -大功告成
<7-6,Amy>- Okay, that's pretty good. - Excellent.

234
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,850
<8-1,Stuart>那个女的怎么样
<8-1,Stuart>How about her?

235
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:31,650
<8-1,Stuart>不行
<8-1,Stuart>No!

236
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:32,850
<8-2,Raj>不能找太漂亮的
<8-2,Raj>No pretty girls!

237
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:34,560
<8-2,Raj>我们得先从普通人开始练习
<8-2,Raj>The point is to talk to regular people

238
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,190
<8-2,Raj>-然后慢慢提到漂亮女孩  -好吧
<8-2,Raj>- and work our way up to pretty girls. - Fine.

239
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:41,280
<8-3,Stuart>那位带着助步器的老太太怎么样
<8-3,Stuart>How about that old lady with the walker?

240
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,640
<8-4,Raj>这得看情况了
<8-4,Raj>That depends.

241
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,740
<8-4,Raj>在某种角度上看  你觉得她性感呢
<8-4,Raj>On any level, do you think she's hot?

242
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,820
<8-5,Stuart>还是找下一位吧
<8-5,Stuart>We'll find somebody else.

243
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,760
<9-1,Sheldon>金橘
<9-1,Sheldon>Kumquat?

244
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,550
<9-2,Amy>凑合吧
<9-2,Amy>I guess.

245
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,310
<9-3,Sheldon>软油膏

246
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:05,670
<9-4,Amy>行
<9-4,Amy>Sure.

247
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:08,820
<9-5,Sheldon>那么你觉得软油膏是比金橘
<9-5,Sheldon>Now, would you say ointment

248
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:13,730
<9-5,Sheldon>更好笑  一样好笑  还是更不好笑呢
<9-5,Sheldon>is more, equal to, or less funny than kumquat?

249
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,470
<9-6,Amy>我再也不想和你一起玩了
<9-6,Amy>I don't think I want to go out with you anymore.

250
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:21,370
<9-7,Sheldon>你别跟我开玩笑了好吗
<9-7,Sheldon>Will you please stop joking around?

251
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:23,510
<9-7,Sheldon>我可是认真地在比较呢
<9-7,Sheldon>I'm trying to figure this out.

252
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,150
<9-8,Amy>谢尔顿  你打算还要问多少个词啊
<9-8,Amy>Sheldon, how many words are you gonna go through?

253
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,860
<9-9,Sheldon>全部词
<9-9,Sheldon>All of them.

254
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,850
<10-1,Penny>你的戏份没有被砍
<10-1,Penny>You didn't get your part cut.

255
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:35,070
<10-2,Voice on TV>好了宝贝  听我说
<10-2,Voice on TV>All right, baby, here's the deal.

256
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:38,190
<10-1,Penny>你的戏份也没有被砍
<10-1,Penny>And you didn't get your part cut.

257
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:41,580
<10-3,Penny>一帮老得不能勃起的老头子
<10-3,Penny>Yep, bunch of old guys rocking out in a band,

258
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,180
<10-3,Penny>蹦蹦跳跳玩乐团
<10-3,Penny>all with erectile dysfunction,

259
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:45,100
<10-3,Penny>你们的戏份居然也没有被砍
<10-3,Penny>you didn't get your part cut!

260
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:51,390
<10-4,Leonard>能和你聊聊吗
<10-4,Leonard>Can we talk?

261
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:54,940
<10-5,Penny>可以聊  但佩妮的部份可能会被砍掉
<10-5,Penny>We can, but the part of Penny might get cut.

262
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:59,490
<10-6,Leonard>我之前实在太差劲了
<10-6,Leonard>That was really crappy of me.

263
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:02,220
<10-6,Leonard>演员这一行要出名实在不容易
<10-6,Leonard>What you're trying to do is hard,

264
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,030
<10-6,Leonard>但也有人成功过
<10-6,Leonard>but people do make it,

265
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:07,800
<10-6,Leonard>我发自内心地相信你也能是成功的一员
<10-6,Leonard>and I really do believe you could be one of them.

266
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,550
<10-7,Penny>谢了
<10-7,Penny>Thank you.

267
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,240
<10-7,Penny>而且
<10-7,Penny>And...

268
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,710
<10-8,Leonard>为了表示我对你有信心
<10-8,Leonard>to show you how much I believe in you,

269
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:16,860
<10-8,Leonard>我帮你争取到了一个试镜机会
<10-8,Leonard>I kind of got you an audition.

270
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,850
<10-9,Penny>真的吗  什么戏
<10-9,Penny>Are you serious? For what?

271
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:21,260
<10-10,Leonard>-最新的《星球大战》电影  -什么
<10-10,Leonard>- The new Star Wars movie. - What?!

272
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:23,030
<10-11,Penny>你怎么办到的
<10-11,Penny>How did you manage that?!

273
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:25,080
<10-12,Leonard>现在正好有个网上活动  自己录一段影
<10-12,Leonard>There's this thing online, you put yourself on tape

274
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,880
<10-12,Leonard>发送过去  任何人都有机会
<10-12,Leonard>and just send it in-- anyone can do it.

275
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:31,730
<10-13,Penny>拜托  莱纳德  这不过是宣传的噱头而已
<10-13,Penny>Come on Leonard, this is just a PR stunt.

276
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:35,050
<10-14,Leonard>那又怎么样  就算是噱头  你还是有优势啊
<10-14,Leonard>So? Even if it is, you have a huge advantage

277
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:36,700
<10-14,Leonard>你可是货真价实的女演员呢
<10-14,Leonard>because you're an actual actress.

278
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:40,150
<10-14,Leonard>其他参加试镜的都是些怪咖和宅男
<10-14,Leonard>Most of the people doing this are just weirdoes and nerds.

279
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:44,310
<10-14,Leonard>沃罗威茨前两天就把他的录像发过去了
<10-14,Leonard>Wolowitz sent his in two days ago.

280
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:46,410
<10-15,Penny>够了  别说这事了
<10-15,Penny>Really, let it go.

281
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:48,140
<10-16,Leonard>听我说  也许这事希望渺茫
<10-16,Leonard>Look, maybe it is a long shot,

282
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,290
<10-16,Leonard>但有时皇天不负有心人
<10-16,Leonard>but sometimes long shots happen.

283
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:52,960
<10-16,Leonard>卢克·天行者只有一次机会
<10-16,Leonard>Luke Skywalker was only given one chance

284
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,290
<10-16,Leonard>毁灭死星
<10-16,Leonard>to destroy the Death Star.

285
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:56,840
<10-16,Leonard>他必须把鱼雷投进一个废气口
<10-16,Leonard>He had to get a torpedo into an exhaust port

286
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,410
<10-16,Leonard>可气口只有2米宽而已
<10-16,Leonard>that was only two meters wide,

287
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:00,290
<10-16,Leonard>但在原力的帮助下  他终于...
<10-16,Leonard>but with the help of The Force, he...

288
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:03,180
<10-16,Leonard>我感觉到你对我的恨意
<10-16,Leonard>Wow, I can feel you hating me right now.

289
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:09,990
<11-1,Stuart>那边穿着运动装快走的女士怎么样
<11-1,Stuart>How about that lady in the sweat suit, speed-walking?

290
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:12,650
<11-2,Raj>她人看着挺和善  挺容易
<11-2,Raj>Yeah, she seems friendly and easy to...

291
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:14,500
<11-2,Raj>没戏了  她走得不见人影了
<11-2,Raj>Never mind, she's gone.

292
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,000
<11-2,Raj>看来和人交流还是太难了
<11-2,Raj>Yeah, maybe talking to people is too hard.

293
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:22,030
<11-3,Stuart>我们可以去百货商店
<11-3,Stuart>We could go over to that department store,

294
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:24,100
<11-3,Stuart>用人体模特进行练习啊
<11-3,Stuart>practice on the mannequins.

295
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,070
<11-3,Stuart>不知道
<11-3,Stuart>I don't know.

296
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,370
<11-4,Raj>那些模特穿得很有型
<11-4,Raj>They're dressed very stylishly.

297
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:28,600
<11-4,Raj>估计个性也是跩翻天
<11-4,Raj>They're probably stuck-up.

298
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:32,350
<11-4,Raj>这一切太荒唐了
<11-4,Raj>This is ridiculous.

299
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:33,820
<11-4,Raj>下一个走过来的人
<11-4,Raj>The next person that walks by,

300
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:36,760
<11-4,Raj>不管是什么人  都是我们的交流对象
<11-4,Raj>no matter who it is, they're the one.

301
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,940
<11-4,Raj>我们这辈子注定死在这里了
<11-4,Raj>We're gonna die here.

302
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:47,210
<12-1,Amy>-你们好  -你好啊
<12-1,Amy>- Hello. - Hey.

303

<12-3,Howard>谢尔顿呢
<12-3,Howard>Where's Sheldon?

304
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:50,270
<12-4,Amy>他窝在家里努力用科学的方法
<12-4,Amy>He's home trying to use science

305
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:52,180
<12-4,Amy>研究幽默的本质呢
<12-4,Amy>to determine the basis of humor.

306
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,690
<12-5,Bernadette>-那可挺有趣的  -是累死人才对
<12-5,Bernadette>- That's interesting. - It's exhausting.

307
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:55,990
<12-6,Amy>你们知道一个"敲敲门笑话"
<12-6,Amy>Do you have any idea how hard it is

308
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:58,340
<12-6,Amy>以谢尔顿的方式来讲会有多难笑吗
<12-6,Amy>to laugh at a knock-knock joke that starts with,

309
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,240
<12-6,Amy>"敲敲敲  艾米"
<12-6,Amy>"Knock-knock-knock, Amy,

310
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,640
<12-6,Amy>"敲敲敲  艾米  敲敲敲  艾米"
<12-6,Amy>knock-knock-knock, Amy, knock-knock-knock, Amy"?

311
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:03,960
<12-7,Bernadette>你想让他闭嘴
<12-7,Bernadette>If you want him to stop,

312
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:07,040
<12-7,Bernadette>有时候假笑几声就是最简单的办法
<12-7,Bernadette>sometimes the easiest thing to do is just fake a laugh.

313
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,290
<12-8,Howard>假笑
<12-8,Howard>Fake a laugh?

314
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,160
<12-8,Howard>你这招也用来对付过我吗
<12-8,Howard>Do you ever do that with me?

315
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,730
<12-9,Bernadette>当然没有啦
<12-9,Bernadette>No, of course not.

316
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:18,350
<12-10,Howard>反正我能看得出来
<12-10,Howard>Well, I'd be able to tell anyway.

317
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:20,110
<12-11,Bernadette>我不觉得
<12-11,Bernadette>I don't think you would.

318
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:23,270
<12-12,Howard>拜托  我曾逗得大把女生笑得花枝乱颤
<12-12,Howard>Please, I've made plenty of girls laugh,

319
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:25,380
<12-12,Howard>有时候约她们出去就超级有笑点了
<12-12,Howard>sometimes just by asking them out.

320
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:00,720
<12-12,Howard>你就假笑吧  我还假高潮呢
<12-12,Howard>Yeah? Well, I fake my orgasms.

321
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:07,400
<13-1,Leonard (on phone)>一百朵长茎红玫瑰多少钱
<13-1,Leonard (on phone)>Yes, how much for a hundred long-stemmed red roses?

322
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:09,700
<13-1,Leonard (on phone)>真的吗
<13-1,Leonard (on phone)>Really?

<13-3,Leonard>Yeah, I'll call you back.

325
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,400
<13-4,Penny>我知道你是想用《星战》什么的
<13-4,Penny>Look, I know you were just trying to help

326
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,990
<13-4,Penny>来鼓励我
<13-4,Penny>with your Star Wars thing.

327
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:25,330
<13-4,Penny>我不是有意评价为"白痴"的
<13-4,Penny>I didn't mean to call it idiotic.

328
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:27,220
<13-5,Leonard>我想你给出的评价不是"白痴"
<13-5,Leonard>Well, I don't think you called it idiotic.

329
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,750
<13-6,Penny>抱歉  我本来想评价为"白痴"
<13-6,Penny>Sorry, I meant to.

330
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:35,890
<13-6,Penny>总之  我只是跟我自己过不去
<13-6,Penny>Anyway, um, I was just upset with myself.

331
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:38,260
<13-6,Penny>我并没有生你的气
<13-6,Penny>I wasn't mad at you.

332
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:41,470
<13-6,Penny>我只是觉得人生支离破碎了
<13-6,Penny>I just feel like everything is falling apart.

333
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:42,600
<13-7,Leonard>别这样  没事的
<13-7,Leonard>Come on. It's okay.

334
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,350
<13-8,Penny>不  有事  看我混的
<13-8,Penny>No, it's not okay! Look at me, okay?!

335
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:47,040
<13-8,Penny>多年以前打了份服务员的临时工
<13-8,Penny>I took a temp job as a waitress forever ago,

336
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,620
<13-8,Penny>现在还在做
<13-8,Penny>and I'm still doing it.

337
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,150
<13-8,Penny>我不能辞职  猜猜原因
<13-8,Penny>I can't quit, because guess what?

338
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,510
<13-8,Penny>其它工作我都做不了
<13-8,Penny>I can't do anything else.

339
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:53,000
<13-8,Penny>我终于等来了事业大转折
<13-8,Penny>And I finally get my big break,

340
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,870
<13-8,Penny>结果机会就这样没了
<13-8,Penny>and it goes away!

341
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,160
<13-8,Penny>我太失败了
<13-8,Penny>I'm such a mess.

342
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,800
<13-9,Leonard>-你不失败  -是吗
<13-9,Leonard>- No, you're not. - Really?!

00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,950
<13-10,Penny>今天早上在星巴克
<13-10,Penny>'Cause this morning at Starbucks,

344
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:02,170
<13-10,Penny>一条脏内裤从我裤管里掉了出来
<13-10,Penny>a pair of old underwear fell out of my pant leg!

345
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,490
<13-10,Penny>只掉了一条  里面还有
<13-10,Penny>And it wasn't the only one in there.

346
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:12,350
<13-11,Leonard>听我说  这只是一点小挫折
<13-11,Leonard>Okay, listen to me, this is just a minor setback.

347
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:13,640
<13-12,Penny>这不是  明白吗
<13-12,Penny>No, it's not, okay?!

<13-12,Penny>我已经离家十年了
<13-12,Penny>I've been out here for, like, ten years!

00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:17,020
<13-12,Penny>我依然一无所有
<13-12,Penny>I've nothing to show for it!

<13-13,Leonard>你有我啊
