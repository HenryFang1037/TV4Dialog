<8-14,Sheldon>好了  灭了
<8-14,Sheldon>Okay, it's done.

2
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:03,420
<1-1,Penny>伙计们
<1-1,Penny>Look, guys, for the future,

3
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,160
<1-1,Penny>我不介意以后帮你们灭大蜘蛛
<1-1,Penny>I don't mind killing the big spiders,

4
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,370
<1-1,Penny>但那么小的不用我出手吧
<1-1,Penny>But you have to at least try with the little ones.

5
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:09,200
<1-2,Sheldon>佩妮  拜托
<1-2,Sheldon>Penny, please.

6
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,930
<1-2,Sheldon>我们面对的问题可比蜘蛛纲动物严峻得多
<1-2,Sheldon>We're facing a far more serious problem than stray arachnids.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,300
<1-3,Leonard>谢尔顿  没那么严重
<1-3,Leonard>Sheldon, it's not so bad.

8
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:16,670
<1-4,Sheldon>不严重  简直是毛骨悚然
<1-4,Sheldon>Not bad? it's horrible.

9
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:18,840
<1-4,Sheldon>你觉得像听故事一样
<1-4,Sheldon>I mean, you hear stories about this sort of thing,

10
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,370
<1-4,Sheldon>以为不会发生在你身上
<1-4,Sheldon>But you never think it'll happen to you.

11
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,470
<1-5,Leonard>他们不就是把你的饺子蒸了一下嘛
<1-5,Leonard>So they steamed your dumplings.

12
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:23,750
<1-5,Leonard>算了吧
<1-5,Leonard>Get over it.

13
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,970
<1-5,Leonard>拜托  换个新话题
<1-5,Leonard>New topic, please.

14
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,360
<1-6,Howard>好吧  佩妮
<1-6,Howard>All right, penny.

15
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,230
<1-6,Howard>我借这个机会向你表达
<1-6,Howard>Let me take this opportunity to point out

16
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,820
<1-6,Howard>你今天看起来相当令人销魂
<1-6,Howard>That you are looking particularly ravishing today.

17
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:38,190
<1-7,Penny>霍华德  一千个套套都别想
<1-7,Penny>Not with a thousand condoms, howard.

18
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,360
<1-8,Howard>这么说还真有个数量
<1-8,Howard>So, there is a number.

19
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:46,690
<1-9,Penny>拜托  换个新话题
<1-9,Penny>Okay, new topic, please.

20
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,990
<1-9,Penny>你们知道楼上5A的人要搬出去吗
<1-9,Penny>Hey, did you hear the people upstairs in 5a are moving out?

21
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:51,520
<1-10,Leonard>-别说  嘘  -虾米
<1-10,Leonard>- No, shh-shh-shh! - what?!

22
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:53,560
<1-11,Sheldon>楼上的人要搬了
<1-11,Sheldon>The people upstairs are moving out.

23
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,160
<1-13,Leonard>别说
<1-13,Leonard>No!

24
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,620
<1-14,Sheldon>恐怖至极
<1-14,Sheldon>The horror...

25
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:00,790
<1-15,Leonard>你干嘛非要提这事呢
<1-15,Leonard>Why would you just say something like that?

26
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,620
<1-16,Sheldon>不  不  不
<1-16,Sheldon>No, no, no, no, no, no, no...

27
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:05,860
<1-17,Penny>那我还能怎么说
<1-17,Penny>How else was I supposed to say it?

28
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,750
<1-18,Leonard>慢一点  就像放一条新买的鱼进鱼缸
<1-18,Leonard>Slowly. like putting a new fish in a tank.

29
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,520
<1-18,Leonard>不能直接丢进去
<1-18,Leonard>You don't just drop it in.

30
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,760
<1-18,Leonard>要连鱼带袋子先放进去一段时间
<1-18,Leonard>You let the bag sit in the water a while.

31
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,520
<1-19,Sheldon>恐怖至极
<1-19,Sheldon>The horror...

32
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:19,460
<1-20,Penny>谢尔顿  我保证不会有事的
<1-20,Penny>Sheldon, I'm sure it's going to be fine.

33
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,160
<1-21,Sheldon>不可能会好了
<1-21,Sheldon>No, it's not going to be fine.

34
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:22,290
<1-21,Sheldon>改变总是不好的
<1-21,Sheldon>Change is never fine.

35
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,720
<1-21,Sheldon>人们说改变是好事  事实才不是
<1-21,Sheldon>They say it is, but it's not.

36
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:27,790
<1-22,Penny>亲爱的  你认识那些要搬的人吗
<1-22,Penny>Okay, honey, did you even know the people that are moving out?

37
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,290
<1-23,Sheldon>我从没见过他们
<1-23,Sheldon>I never met them.

38
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,960
<1-23,Sheldon>这样他们才完美
<1-23,Sheldon>That's what made them perfect.

39
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:34,190
<1-23,Sheldon>不用尴尬地在楼道打招呼
<1-23,Sheldon>There were no awkward "hellos" in the halls.

40
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,660
<1-23,Sheldon>不会有高跟鞋踩在木质地板的咔咔声
<1-23,Sheldon>There's no clickety-clacking of high heel shoes on hardwood floors.

41
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,840
<1-23,Sheldon>这一家就像是一窝小猫
<1-23,Sheldon>They may as well have been a family of

42
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,420
<1-23,Sheldon>从这个窗帘跳到那个窗帘
<1-23,Sheldon>Cats just jumping around from drape to drape.

43
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:45,990
<1-23,Sheldon>但没有尿液中恼人的氨味
<1-23,Sheldon>Without that annoying ammonia urine smell.

44
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:49,620
<1-24,Penny>我保证新来的也会安安静静的
<1-24,Penny>Well, I'm sure the new people will be just as quiet.

45
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:51,090
<1-25,Sheldon>你怎么知道
<1-25,Sheldon>You can't know that.

46
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,660
<1-25,Sheldon>你怎么可能知道
<1-25,Sheldon>How can you possibly know that?

47
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,390
<1-26,Penny>对  我不知道  告诉你
<1-26,Penny>You're right, I can't. you know what?

48
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:57,190
<1-26,Penny>任何人都可能租那个房
<1-26,Penny>Anyone could rent that apartment now.

49
00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:00,420
<1-26,Penny>歌剧歌手啦 跺脚舞演员啦
<1-26,Penny>an opera singer, the cast of stomp...

50

<1-26,Penny>有条木腿的踢踏舞海盗啦
<1-26,Penny>Yeah, a tap-dancing pirate with a wooden leg.

51
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,220
<1-27,Leonard>你干嘛要越搞越糟
<1-27,Leonard>Why are you making it worse?

52
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:10,760
<1-28,Penny>我想搞好点  他不干而已
<1-28,Penny>I tried making it better. he wouldn't go for it.

53
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,860
<1-29,Howard (after Raj whispers to him)>对啊  真是好主意
<1-29,Howard (after Raj whispers to him)>You're right! that's a great idea.

54
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,720
<1-30,Leonard>-什么  -我去租那个房
<1-30,Leonard>- What? - I'll take the apartment upstairs.

55
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:17,960
<1-31,Howard>我就能摆脱我妈
<1-31,Howard>I can finally get away from my mother

56
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,660
<1-31,Howard>我们也有更多时间聚聚
<1-31,Howard>And we can all spend some more time together.

57
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,190
<1-31,Howard>明白我的用意吧
<1-31,Howard>If you catch my drift.

127
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,640
<3-19,Alicia>猫中之猫？
<3-19,Alicia>"freakishly feline"?

128
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,770
<3-20,Sheldon>这是你给出的答案还是你没有理解问题
<3-20,Sheldon>Is that your answer or do you not understand the question?

<3-20,Sheldon>先不说这个

<3-24,Leonard>抱歉
<3-24,Leonard>Oh, I'm sorry.

00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,400
<3-27,Sheldon>哭哭啼啼的可能性
<3-27,Sheldon>Infants above my head are a possibility.

<4-13,Sheldon>Attire is that you're out of clean clothes again.

<4-24,Sheldon>"it's a trap."

180
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,670
<4-24,Sheldon>你得把我想象成一个大乌贼脑袋
<4-24,Sheldon>You have to imagine me with a giant squid head.

181
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,600
<4-24,Sheldon>"这是个圈套"
<4-24,Sheldon>"it's a trap."

182
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:58,870
<4-24,Sheldon>"这是个圈套"
<4-24,Sheldon>"it's a trap."

183
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,840
<4-24,Sheldon>"这是个圈套"

<5-1,Sheldon>请进

186
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,900
<5-5,Sheldon>-这个  算是吧  -什么叫算是吧
<5-5,Sheldon>-Well, sort of. -how does one "sort of..."

187
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:37,000
<5-6,Penny>我买了新衣服  行了吧
<5-6,Penny>I bought new clothes, okay?

188
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:38,770
<5-6,Penny>莱纳德在不在
<5-6,Penny>Is leonard around?

189
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,370
<5-7,Sheldon>他在楼上跟艾丽西娅一起
<5-7,Sheldon>He's upstairs at Alicia's.

190
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,000
<5-8,Penny>好吧  行  没啥
<5-8,Penny>Oh. all right, that's cool, no biggie.

191
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:46,540
<5-8,Penny>他答应过帮我装打印机  再等一会吧
<5-8,Penny>He said he'd help me set up my printer, but I guess I can wait.

192
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,070
<5-8,Penny>他到底在楼上干什么呢
<5-8,Penny>What exactly is he doing up there?

193
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:51,640
<5-9,Sheldon>我认为是旨在毁灭我而进行的战略行动
<5-9,Sheldon>In what I can only perceive as a tactical move to destroy me,

194
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:55,200
<5-9,Sheldon>他跟库萨帕里和沃罗威茨在帮她装音响
<5-9,Sheldon>He is with wolowitz and koothrappali setting up her stereo.

195
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:57,540
<5-10,Penny>他们都在楼上 是吗
<5-10,Penny>Oh, they're all up there, huh?

196
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,740
<5-10,Penny>正常
<5-10,Penny>Hmm, typical.

197
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,070
<5-11,Sheldon>这很明显不正常
<5-11,Sheldon>It's axiomatically atypical.

198
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,020
<5-11,Sheldon>到现在为止  他们不了解艾丽西娅
<5-11,Sheldon>Up until recently, they did not know alicia,

199
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:07,540
<5-11,Sheldon>也没有在其他地方相处过
<5-11,Sheldon>And had no encounters with her in a previous location.

200
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,650
<5-11,Sheldon>以前他们从不上楼拜访房客
<5-11,Sheldon>They never went upstairs to visit the former tenants,

201
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:11,900
<5-11,Sheldon>而你将他们的行为鉴定为正常
<5-11,Sheldon>So your characterization of their behavior as "typical"

202
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:14,600
<5-11,Sheldon>是绝对的谬误
<5-11,Sheldon>Is demonstrably fallacious.

203
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,900
<5-12,Penny>好了  现在我看到一颗大乌贼脑袋了
<5-12,Penny>Okay, now I see the giant squid head.

204
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,170
<5-13,Sheldon>这下好  我又得重新来一遍
<5-13,Sheldon>Oh, great! now, I have to start all over again.

205
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,870
<6-1,Howard>我是想过租这房子
<6-1,Howard>Yeah, I thought about renting this apartment,

206
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:36,730
<6-1,Howard>不过我更像那种城里
<6-1,Howard>But I'm really more of a

207
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:38,600
<6-1,Howard>住跃层的黄金单身汉
<6-1,Howard>"downtown loft" kind of guy.

208
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:40,600
<6-2,Alicia>不错啊  你现在住跃层吗
<6-2,Alicia>Cool. so are you in a loft now?

209
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,270
<6-2,Alicia>事实上
<6-2,Alicia>Oh, actually,

210
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:44,540
<6-3,Howard>我现在阿塔迪纳那里和一个女人同居
<6-3,Howard>I'm, uh, living with a woman in altadena.

211
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,170
<6-3,Howard>不过是纯柏拉图式的  她同时是我的女佣
<6-3,Howard>Purely platonic. she's also my maid.

212
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,970
<6-4,Alicia>听起来蛮不错的
<6-4,Alicia>Sounds like a sweet deal.

213
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,470
<6-5,Howard>不过说实话  她差你太远了
<6-5,Howard>I won't lie. it's pretty dope.

214
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:56,040
<6-7,Alicia>有人吗
<6-7,Alicia>Hello?

00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,770
<6-13,Alicia>他们真是我有过最帅的技术帮手了
<6-13,Alicia>I've never had such good-looking technical support.

224
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,340
<6-14,Howard>不值一提就是不值一提的意思
<6-14,Howard>"shucks" means shucks.

<6-14,Howard>你就不能等等再说这个
<6-14,Howard>Let one go once in a while.

<6-17,Leonard>艾丽西娅跟你一样也是个演员
<6-17,Leonard>Alicia is an actress, just like you.

228
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:36,200
<6-18,Penny>太棒了
<6-18,Penny>That is so awesome.

229
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,300
<6-19,Alicia>想是这样想  但也没那么容易
<6-19,Alicia>Well, trying to be, but it's so hard.

230
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:40,670
<6-20,Penny>是啊  跟我说说关于你的事
<6-20,Penny>Yeah, I know, tell me about it.

231
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,030
<6-21,Alicia>我在这里待了足足三个月
<6-21,Alicia>I've been out here three months,

232
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:44,080
<6-21,Alicia>结果只搞到几个全国广告
<6-21,Alicia>And all I've gotten is a couple of national commercials

233
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:46,140
<6-21,Alicia>还有肥皂剧的小客串
<6-21,Alicia>And this recurring thing on a soap.

234
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,600
<6-22,Penny>所以我现在还在蛋糕店工作
<6-22,Penny>That's why I work at the cheesecake factory.

235
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,570
<6-22,Penny>我感觉那些角色都不适合我
<6-22,Penny>I'm holding out for the right part.

236
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,510
<6-23,Leonard>艾丽西娅  你DVD想怎么设啊
<6-23,Leonard>Alicia, what do you want as your default setting for dvds

237
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:01,340
<6-23,Leonard>5.1杜比还是家庭影院
<6-23,Leonard>5.1 dolby or dts?

00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,970
<6-24,Alicia>你看着办好了  小可爱

00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,840
<6-26,Penny>我刚在网上读了个超赞的科学笑话
<6-26,Penny>I read the best science joke on the internet.

243
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,070
<6-26,Penny>艾丽西娅  你不懂的  但是他们很喜欢这个
<6-26,Penny>Alicia, you won't get it, but it's right up their alley.

244
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,510
<6-26,Penny>就是 从前有个物理学家
<6-26,Penny>Anyway, so, this physicist goes into an ice cream parlor

245
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,390
<6-26,Penny>每周都去冰淇淋店点两个圣代
<6-26,Penny>every week and orders an ice

246
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:28,650
<6-26,Penny>一个自己吃
<6-26,Penny>Cream sundae for himself, and then offers one

247
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,800
<6-26,Penny>一个放在旁边的空座位
<6-26,Penny>To the empty stool sitting next to him.

248
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:33,840
<6-26,Penny>好久都是这样 直到店主好奇问他为什么
<6-26,Penny>This goes on for a while until the owner finally asks him what he's doing.

249
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,870
<6-26,Penny>他说  因为我是物理学家
<6-26,Penny>The man says, "well, I'm a physicist,

250
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:40,410
<6-26,Penny>而量子物理理论 告诉我们总有几率
<6-26,Penny>and quantum mechanics... Teaches us "that it is possible

251
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:45,420
<6-26,Penny>这张空座位上面 的物质会变成一个
<6-26,Penny>For the matter above this stool "to spontaneously turn into a beautiful woman

252
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:48,300
<6-26,Penny>可能爱上我的MM
<6-26,Penny>Who might accept my offer and fall in love with me."

253
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:50,070
<6-26,Penny>店主然后说   这里每天
<6-26,Penny>The owner then says, "well, lots of single,

254
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:51,740
<7-1,Sheldon>都有大队单身MM
<7-1,Sheldon>"beautiful women come in here ever day.

255
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,870
<6-26,Penny>你干嘛不买冰淇淋泡她们
<6-26,Penny>"why don't you buy an ice cream for one of them,

256
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,640
<6-26,Penny>让她们爱上你
<6-26,Penny>And they might fall in love with you?"

257
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:59,840
<6-26,Penny>物理学家说  那个发生的几率又可能有多大呢
<6-26,Penny>And the physicist says, "yeah, but what are the odds of that happening?"

258
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:07,340
<6-27,Leonard>这有点侮辱人  你不觉得吗
<6-27,Leonard>It's a little insulting, don't you think?

259
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,640
<6-28,Penny>怎么会知道
<6-28,Penny>How would I know?

260
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,700
<6-28,Penny>我自己都不理解这有什么好笑的
<6-28,Penny>I'm not even sure I get it.

00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,370
<6-29,Alicia>对了  莱纳德

<7-3,Sheldon>听听啊  呯呯呯
<7-3,Sheldon>Listen to that. Stomp, stomp, stomp.

<7-3,Sheldon>That's wolowitz in his stacked heels that fool no one.

277
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:17,040
<7-4,Penny>我不知道我为什么会介意呢
<7-4,Penny>I don't even know why I care.

278
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,170
<7-4,Penny>我才不介意
<7-4,Penny>I don't care.

279
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,340
<7-4,Penny>好吧  我介意得去背那个白痴笑话 但是我只介意到那个程度

<7-5,Sheldon>Occurs in beehives you might find interesting.

282
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:29,010
<7-5,Sheldon>有时候
<7-5,Sheldon>Occasionally,

283
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:33,500
<7-5,Sheldon>新的蜂王会在老蜂王还在位时闯进来
<7-5,Sheldon>A new queen will arrive while the old queen is still in power.

284
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:34,930
<7-5,Sheldon>此时
<7-5,Sheldon>When this happens,

285
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:38,930
<7-5,Sheldon>老蜂王要不另谋出路
<7-5,Sheldon>The old queen must either locate to a new hive or

286
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:44,000
<7-5,Sheldon>要不就去拼个你死我活
<7-5,Sheldon>Engage in a battle to the death until only one queen remains.

287
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:47,940
<7-6,Penny>你说什么呢  我被艾丽西娅威胁了?
<7-6,Penny>What are you saying, that I'm threatened by alicia?

288
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,470
<7-6,Penny>难道你说我是那个老蜂王 现在该滚蛋了
<7-6,Penny>That I'm like the old queen of the hive and it's just time for me to go?

289
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,240
<7-7,Sheldon>我只是在说蜜蜂
<7-7,Sheldon>I'm just talking about bees.
