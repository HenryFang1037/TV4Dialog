1
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:07,440
<1-1,Leonard>-可以去吃午饭了吗  -马上好
<1-1,Leonard>- Hey, ready for lunch? - Oh, one sec.

2
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:11,120
<1-3,Sheldon>那是太空探测车的驱动系统原型吗
<1-3,Sheldon>Is that the prototype drive system for the high-G rover?

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,620
<1-4,Howard>不是啦  伯纳黛特给我买了运动手环
<1-4,Howard>No, Bernadette got me a Fitbit

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,840
<1-4,Howard>好追查我每天运动量有多少
<1-4,Howard>so she can track how much I'm exercising.

5
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,370
<1-5,Leonard>看她还敢不敢再关心你健康
<1-5,Leonard>That'll teach her to care about your health.

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,150
<1-6,Howard>我真想看看哪天我早死时  她震惊的表情
<1-6,Howard>I can't wait to see the look on her face when I die young.

7
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:28,010
<1-7,Raj>你上一次真的去运动是什么时候
<1-7,Raj>When was the last actual exercise you got?

8
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:28,820
<1-8,Howard>前几天
<1-8,Howard>The other day, when

9
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,180
<1-8,Howard>她硬要给我戴上手环  我落荒而逃时
<1-8,Howard>she tried to put that Fitbit on me and I ran away from her.

10
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:34,590
<1-9,Sheldon>最近一份研究指出
<1-9,Sheldon>According to a recent study,

11
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:37,570
<1-9,Sheldon>哪怕你赖着不动  只要心中想着运动
<1-9,Sheldon>simply thinking about exercise, even while sitting still,

12
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:38,930
<1-9,Sheldon>就能给身体带来好处
<1-9,Sheldon>can have physical benefits.

13
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:41,640
<1-9,Sheldon>指不定我现在就在运动呢
<1-9,Sheldon>For all you know, I could be exercising right now.

14
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,990
<1-11,Sheldon>-那你是吗  -还是明天再想吧
<1-11,Sheldon>- Are you? - Eh, I'll do it tomorrow.

15
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:47,910
<1-12,Leonard>我们多运动一点也不是什么坏事啊
<1-12,Leonard>It wouldn't be the worst thing if we were more active.

16
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:50,470
<1-13,Howard>兄台此言甚是有理
<1-13,Howard>Oh. You make an excellent point.

17
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,710
<1-13,Howard>跑步的愉悦感蹭蹭往上飙啊
<1-13,Howard>Ooh, I think I'm getting a runner's high!

18
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,710
<1-13,Howard>当运动量超过某一阶段时  体内便会分泌脑内啡
<1-13,Howard>会有如同吗啡一样的止痛和欣快感

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,620
<1-13,Howard>翻译：干将莫邪赛太公  双剑合璧YY猫
<1-13,Howard>猫中之王  别扭大菜

29
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,680
<2-1,Leonard>看看大学里的各种运动社团
<2-1,Leonard>Look at all these activities the university has.

30
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,590
<2-1,Leonard>攀岩社  射箭  夺旗橄榄球
<2-1,Leonard>Rock climbing club, archery, flag football.

31
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:30,950
<2-2,Sheldon>旗字让我兴奋  橄榄球让我无力
<2-2,Sheldon>Had me at flag, lost me at football.

32
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:33,340
<2-3,Penny>我觉得你们想要多动动真的很棒
<2-3,Penny>Yeah, I think it's great you guys want to get more exercise,

33
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:36,320
<2-3,Penny>可是你们真觉得选择运动合适吗
<2-3,Penny>but do you really think sports is the right choice for you?

34
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,330
<2-4,Leonard>你什么意思
<2-4,Leonard>What are you saying?

35
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:39,720
<2-4,Leonard>我们身体协调性太差不适合玩体育吗
<2-4,Leonard>We're not coordinated enough to play sports?

36
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,530
<2-5,Penny>莱纳德  亲爱的
<2-5,Penny>Okay, Leonard, sweetheart,

37
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:45,390
<2-5,Penny>你玩个拼字游戏都能扭伤脚踝
<2-5,Penny>you twisted your ankle playing Scrabble.

38
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:49,300
<2-6,Leonard>那一次堪比打麻将  连庄还自摸清一色
<2-6,Leonard>I got a triple-word score with a double letter "Q."

39
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,900
<2-6,Leonard>此时不跳庆祝嘚瑟舞
<2-6,Leonard>If that's not a time to bust out the Scrabble dance,

40
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,760
<2-6,Leonard>那这舞还有啥存在价值
<2-6,Leonard>what's the point of having one?

41
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:58,480
<2-6,Leonard>巴里·克瑞普吉开了一个击剑俱乐部呢
<2-6,Leonard>Hey, Barry Kripke started a fencing club.

42
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,800
<2-6,Leonard>有意思
<2-6,Leonard>Interesting.

43
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,790
<2-7,Sheldon>击剑的吸引力在于不失风度
<2-7,Sheldon>Sword fighting does hold a certain elegant appeal.

44
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,310
<2-7,Sheldon>同时也满足了我们几个
<2-7,Sheldon>And I would imagine it meets many

45
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,680
<2-7,Sheldon>对运动项目的要求
<2-7,Sheldon>of our personal criteria for a sport.

46
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,940
<2-8,Leonard>它在室内进行  不需要擦防晒霜
<2-8,Leonard>It's indoors, so no sunscreen.

47
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,000
<2-9,Sheldon>不需要扔  不需要接
<2-9,Sheldon>No throwing, no catching,

48
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,400
<2-9,Sheldon>还不需要跑
<2-9,Sheldon>no running.

49
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,960
<2-10,Leonard>不用穿可能会被人脱的体育短裤
<2-10,Leonard>No gym shorts that can be yanked down.

50
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,960
<2-11,Sheldon>或更惨  被人用力往上提
<2-11,Sheldon>Or worse, up.

51
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,990
<2-12,Leonard>同意
<2-12,Leonard>Preach.

52
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,080
<2-13,Sheldon>而且有个加分项
<2-13,Sheldon>And as an added bonus,

53
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,210
<2-13,Sheldon>"一针见血"这词原是击剑中得分之意
<2-13,Sheldon>the word "touche" comes from fencing.

54
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:24,880
<2-13,Sheldon>是我们唯一能不带隐喻地
<2-13,Sheldon>It would be our only opportunity to use it

55
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,930
<2-13,Sheldon>使用这词的地方
<2-13,Sheldon>in a non-metaphorical sense.

56
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,990
<2-14,Leonard>玩捉人游戏的法国校园中也能吧
<2-14,Leonard>What about a game of tag on a French schoolyard?

57
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,730
<2-15,Sheldon>你这话"一针见血"
<2-15,Sheldon>Ah, touche.

58
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,940
<3-1,Stuart>多谢你们能来
<3-1,Stuart>Thanks for coming by.

59
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,510
<3-2,Bernadette>没事  需要我们帮忙什么
<3-2,Bernadette>Sure. So how can we help?

60
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:40,650
<3-3,Stuart>我知道现在越来越多女人买漫画书
<3-3,Stuart>Well, I know more women are buying comics than ever,

61
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:43,410
<3-3,Stuart>但不知道为何  我没法把她们吸引进我的店
<3-3,Stuart>but for some reason, I-I can't get 'em in here.

62
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:45,140
<3-4,Penny>目前你试过哪些揽女客的办法呢
<3-4,Penny>All right, well, what have you tried so far?

63
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:49,320
<3-5,Stuart>我试着摆出更多女性导向的漫画
<3-5,Stuart>Uh, I've-I've been stocking more female-oriented titles.

64
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,600
<3-5,Stuart>洗手间里
<3-5,Stuart>Uh, in the bathroom,

65
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,800
<3-5,Stuart>我特意把厕纸尾端折成小三角造型
<3-5,Stuart>I folded the end of the toilet paper into a triangle.

66
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,050
<3-5,Stuart>而且呢
<3-5,Stuart>And, uh,

67
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:58,830
<3-5,Stuart>你们现在坐的地方正是特选"哺乳区"
<3-5,Stuart>you are now sitting in the official breastfeeding area.

68
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,650
<3-6,Penny>在漫画店里这样好吗
<3-6,Penny>Really? In a comic book store?

69
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:06,590
<3-7,Stuart>不用担心  我在这里正上方装了监控
<3-7,Stuart>Oh, don't worry. I-I've got a camera right up here,

70
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:09,360
<3-7,Stuart>这样我就能从收银台监视
<3-7,Stuart>so I could watch from the counter

71
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,150
<3-7,Stuart>确保没有变态男客偷看
<3-7,Stuart>and make sure guys aren't being pervs.

72
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,860
<3-7,Stuart>总之  我该怎么样做
<3-7,Stuart>Anyway, so what do I got to do to-to

73
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,660
<3-7,Stuart>才能揽进女客呢
<3-7,Stuart>get you in the door?

74
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,410
<3-8,Amy>首先呢
<3-8,Amy>Well, for starters,

75
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:25,490
<3-8,Amy>你得重新考量一下店里的摆设
<3-8,Amy>you might want to rethink some of this artwork.

76
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:29,430
<3-8,Amy>比如这个女人像条狗一样被链子拴住
<3-8,Amy>I mean, this woman's actually on a leash like a dog.

77
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,730
<3-9,Stuart>你又不知道图画的背景故事
<3-9,Stuart>Well, you don't know the backstory.

78
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:35,390
<3-9,Stuart>或许她整天乱蹦到沙发上  才被拴住
<3-9,Stuart>Maybe she kept jumping up on the couch.

79
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,520
<4-1,Raj>我感觉自己好酷啊
<4-1,Raj>I feel cool.

80
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:54,090
<4-1,Raj>就像穿靴子的猫
<4-1,Raj>Like Puss in Boots.

82
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:57,070
<4-2,Leonard>我小时候一直都梦想当个咻噹侠盗
<4-2,Leonard>I always wanted to be a swashbuckler when I was a kid.

83
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,950
<4-3,Sheldon>其实"咻噹"这词是两个字的组合
<4-3,Sheldon>Technically, "swashbuckler" is a combination of two terms.

84
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:02,550
<4-3,Sheldon>"咻"指的是挥剑的声音
<4-3,Sheldon>"Swash" referring to the sound of the sword.

85
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,270
<4-3,Sheldon>咻
<4-3,Sheldon>Swash.

86
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,350
<4-3,Sheldon>而"噹"
<4-3,Sheldon>And then "buckler"

87
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:09,860
<4-3,Sheldon>原意是指一个小手盾  可是你没有
<4-3,Sheldon>meaning a small shield, which you don't have.

88
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,440
<4-4,Raj>那我们还是能当咻咻侠盗啊
<4-4,Raj>We can still be swashers.

89
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,080
<4-5,Howard>说得好  靴猫剑客[孬种]
<4-5,Howard>Well said, Puss.

90
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:19,260
<4-6,Barry>先生们  欢迎来到击剑俱乐部
<4-6,Barry>Gentlemen, welcome to the fencing club.

91
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,650
<4-6,Barry>在开始之前  我想警告你们
<4-6,Barry>Before we start, I just want to warn you,

92
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:23,330
<4-6,Barry>击剑可不是闹着玩
<4-6,Barry>fencing isn't a joke.

93
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,810
<4-6,Barry>我希望你们来上课不是因为觉得
<4-6,Barry>I hope you're not here because you think it's going to be

94
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:26,620
<4-6,Barry>这会像《星球大战》一样
<4-6,Barry>like Star Wars.

95
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,630
<4-7,Leonard>我们不是为那个而来的
<4-7,Leonard>That's not why we're here.

96
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:30,380
<4-8,Raj>我来是以为会像《权力的游戏》中那样
<4-8,Raj>Yeah, I'm here because I think it's gonna be like Game of Thrones.

97
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:33,180
<4-9,Howard>或许跟《公主新娘》也沾点边
<4-9,Howard>And maybe a little Princess Bride.

99
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,050
<4-10,Raj>我忘了还有《公主新娘》
<4-10,Raj>Ooh, ooh! I forgot about Princess Bride!

100
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,880
<4-10,Raj>这才是我来的主因
<4-10,Raj>That's my answer!

101
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:39,470
<4-11,Barry>那很抱歉你们要失望了
<4-11,Barry>Well, sorry to disappoint you,

102
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,670
<4-11,Barry>击剑是很严肃的运动
<4-11,Barry>but fencing is a serious sport.

103
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:42,950
<4-11,Barry>如果你们不愿意全身心投入训练
<4-11,Barry>If you're not willing to put in the effort,

104
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,570
<4-11,Barry>那还是趁早离开吧
<4-11,Barry>you might as well just leave now.

105
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:46,730
<4-12,Sheldon>我们不怕做体力活动
<4-12,Sheldon>We're not afraid of physical activity.

106
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:48,660
<4-13,Howard>我今天已经"跑"了29公里了
<4-13,Howard>I already ran 18 miles today.

107
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,180
<4-14,Barry>好吧  那先从一些基本动作开始
<4-14,Barry>All right. Let's begin with some fundamentals.

108
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,850
<4-14,Barry>这是起势  预备姿势
<4-14,Barry>This is the en garde position.

109
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:58,640
<4-14,Barry>双脚成"L"形  脚跟在同一线上
<4-14,Barry>Feet are in an "L." Heels in a straight line.

110
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,230
<4-14,Barry>持剑手臂与躯干有一拳距离
<4-14,Barry>Elbow is about a fist from the rib cage.

111
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:04,150
<4-14,Barry>注意我的主导腿向前
<4-14,Barry>Notice my dominant leg faces forward.

113
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:05,420
<4-15,Sheldon>天啊
<4-15,Sheldon>Oh, dear.

114
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,740
<4-16,Barry>怎么了  库珀
<4-16,Barry>What's wrong, Cooper?

115
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,780
<4-17,Sheldon>我不太确定我的主导腿是哪条
<4-17,Sheldon>Well, I'm not sure I have a dominant leg.

116
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,240
<4-17,Sheldon>这两条腿都很听话不争宠
<4-17,Sheldon>They're both pretty submissive.

117
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,690
<4-18,Howard>你在公共厕所时
<4-18,Howard>When you're in a public restroom,

118
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,450
<4-18,Howard>习惯用哪只脚冲厕所
<4-18,Howard>which foot do you flush the toilet with?

119
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,400
<4-19,Sheldon>右腿  一直用右腿
<4-19,Sheldon>Right. Always right.

120
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,310
<4-20,Howard>他是右撇子
<4-20,Howard>He's a righty.

121
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:28,000
<4-21,Barry>好的  预备姿势
<4-21,Barry>Okay, show me en garde.

122
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,080
<4-21,Barry>很好  膝盖弯曲
<4-21,Barry>Good. Knees bent,

123
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,510
<4-21,Barry>略微超过脚尖
<4-21,Barry>slightly over the toe.

124
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:34,330
<4-21,Barry>非持剑的手臂抬起保持平衡
<4-21,Barry>Non-sword hand up for balance.

125
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,250
<4-22,Howard>我明天一定浑身酸疼
<4-22,Howard>I am going to feel this tomorrow.

126
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:41,260
<4-23,Barry>第一式叫向前移步
<4-23,Barry>The first move is called an advance.

127
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:44,120
<4-23,Barry>前脚往前迈一步  脚跟先着地
<4-23,Barry>You move your front foot forward, heel to toe.

128
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,590
<4-25,Barry>后脚跟上前
<4-25,Barry>Back foot follows.

129

227
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,110
<6-22,Leonard>他言下之意好像对艾米有意思
<6-22,Leonard>I hate to say it, but it sounds like he's interested in her.

228
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,780
<6-23,Sheldon>这绝对无法接受
<6-23,Sheldon>Well, that's unacceptable.

00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:04,900
<6-24,Leonard>但这事真由不得你
<6-24,Leonard>but it's not really up to you.

231
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,870
<6-25,Sheldon>我知道  但他多蠢啊  瞧他那张蠢脸

00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,630
<6-26,Leonard>就算不是跟他
<6-26,Leonard>Look, even if it's not him,

<6-26,Leonard>艾米以后也可能跟其他人约会
<6-26,Leonard>Amy's probably going to date someone at some point.

234
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,710
<6-27,Sheldon>你真的这么想吗
<6-27,Sheldon>You really think so?

<6-28,Leonard>当然  她值得拥有幸福

00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,170
<6-29,Sheldon>你好大的狗胆

<7-1,Leonard>Listen, I should warn you

238
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:33,510
<7-1,Leonard>约艾米可不是个好主意
<7-1,Leonard>that maybe asking Amy out isn't a good idea.

239
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:35,420
<7-2,Sheldon>巴里  借一步说话
<7-2,Sheldon>Barry, a word?

240
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:38,890
<7-3,Leonard>你将听到我刚说的话的疯狂升级版
<7-3,Leonard>And now the crazy version of what I just said.

241
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:41,080
<7-4,Sheldon>如果你想追求艾米
<7-4,Sheldon>If you intend to pursue Amy,

00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,780
<7-4,Sheldon>我别无选择  只能予以阻止
<7-4,Sheldon>you leave me with no choice but to put a stop to it.

243
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:46,130
<7-5,Barry>你要如何阻止我呢
<7-5,Barry>And how are you gonna do that?

244
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:48,360
<7-6,Sheldon>我要和你决斗
<7-6,Sheldon>By challenging you to a duel.

245
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:52,300
<7-7,Barry>你才上了一节课  我轻松就能废掉你
<7-7,Barry>You've had one lesson. I'll destroy you.

246
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,420
<7-8,Sheldon>所以这场决斗将定于
<7-8,Sheldon>That is why the duel will take place

247
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,380
<7-8,Sheldon>三年后的今天  正午时分
<7-8,Sheldon>at high noon, three years from today.

248
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:00,880
<7-8,Sheldon>如果你是一个货真价实的教练
<7-8,Sheldon>If you're worth your salt as an instructor,

249
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,860
<7-8,Sheldon>三年之后我应该准备好了
<7-8,Sheldon>I should be ready by then.

250
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,220
<7-8,Sheldon>还有你给我小心了
<7-8,Sheldon>Yeah, and be warned.

00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,800
<7-8,Sheldon>我将击中[触摸]你全身各处
<7-8,Sheldon>I'm going to touch you all over.

252
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,020
<7-9,Leonard>这席发言比我想的还要疯狂
<7-9,Leonard>That-that was crazier than I thought.

253
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:18,090
<8-1,Stuart>好了  虽然不一定是真的
<8-1,Stuart>All right, I'm not saying it's true,

254
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:20,360
<8-1,Stuart>但我们可以假设
<8-1,Stuart>but let's-let's consider for a moment

255
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,580
<8-1,Stuart>-问题是出在我身上  -就是
<8-1,Stuart>- that possibly I'm the problem. -Yeah.

256
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,580
<8-4,Amy>-是的  -你可以这么说
<8-4,Amy>- You are. - You can say it.

257
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,950
<8-5,Stuart>好吧  那么...
<8-5,Stuart>Okay, fine. What...?

258
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:27,080
<8-5,Stuart>我该怎么办呢
<8-5,Stuart>I mean, what can I do?

259
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,070
<8-5,Stuart>我一遇到女人就紧张
<8-5,Stuart>I get so nervous around women.

260
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:30,150
<8-6,Penny>你现在跟我们说话
<8-6,Penny>Well, you're talking to us now.

261
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,480
<8-6,Penny>怎么看起来不紧张啊
<8-6,Penny>I mean, you don't seem nervous.

262
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,040
<8-7,Stuart>那是因为我用了个小诀窍
<8-7,Stuart>Well, that's 'cause I'm doing that trick

263
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,230
<8-7,Stuart>就是想象你的听众都赤身裸体
<8-7,Stuart>where you imagine the audience is naked.

264
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:40,280
<8-7,Stuart>顺便一提  身材不错哦  妹子们
<8-7,Stuart>By the way, thumbs up, ladies.

265
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:44,360
<8-8,Amy>你没听见自己刚才的话有多恶心人吗
<8-8,Amy>Do you not hear how creepy that sounds?

266
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:46,270
<8-9,Stuart>我开玩笑而已
<8-9,Stuart>It was a joke.

267
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,450
<8-10,Bernadette>是吗
<8-10,Bernadette>Was it?

268
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,900
<8-11,Stuart>不  我还在继续想象呢
<8-11,Stuart>No, I'm still doing it.

269
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:51,970
<8-11,Stuart>好吧
<8-11,Stuart>Okay.

270
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:53,390
<8-12,Penny>我无意冒犯你  不过
<8-12,Penny>Don't be offended, but...

271
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:56,360
<8-12,Penny>你这人到底有什么毛病啊
<8-12,Penny>what went wrong with you?

272
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:01,490
<8-13,Stuart>可能我原以为我到这个年纪
<8-13,Stuart>I-I guess I assumed at this point in my life,

273
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:04,430
<8-13,Stuart>早就结婚  或者恋爱了
<8-13,Stuart>I would be married or in a relationship,

274
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:05,650
<8-13,Stuart>哪怕有只宠物
<8-13,Stuart>or even have a pet

275
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:08,150
<8-13,Stuart>不会跑掉或自杀的那种也好
<8-13,Stuart>that didn't run away or kill itself.

276
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,080
<8-14,Bernadette>这事真的发生了吗
<8-14,Bernadette>That really happened?

277
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,730
<8-15,Stuart>我不是特别肯定
<8-15,Stuart>I mean, I can't say for sure,

278
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:14,690
<8-15,Stuart>不过我发誓那兔子跳到车头之前
<8-15,Stuart>but I swear that rabbit looked me right in the eye

279
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:16,760
<8-15,Stuart>转身看了我一眼
<8-15,Stuart>before it hopped in front of that car.

280
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,260
<8-15,Stuart>总之  我单身越久
<8-15,Stuart>Anyway, the longer I'm alone,

281
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,820
<8-15,Stuart>就越饥不择食
<8-15,Stuart>the more desperate I get.

282
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:27,150
<8-16,Amy>斯图尔特  我能理解你
<8-16,Amy>Stuart, believe it or not, I understand.

283
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,540
<8-16,Amy>在我遇见谢尔顿之前
<8-16,Amy>You know, before I met Sheldon,

284
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:31,390
<8-16,Amy>我曾经孤单了很长很长时间
<8-16,Amy>I was alone for a really long time.

285
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:33,690
<8-16,Amy>我竭尽一切让周围的人喜欢我
<8-16,Amy>I was so desperate for people to like me,

286
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:35,200
<8-16,Amy>当我遇见她们时
<8-16,Amy>when I met these guys,

287
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,970
<8-16,Amy>我用尽全力来隐藏我的不安全感
<8-16,Amy>it took everything in my power to hide my insecurity.

288
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:43,650
<8-17,Stuart>好了  我想大家都感受到了
<8-17,Stuart>Okay, we're all feeling it.

289
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:45,970
<8-17,Stuart>好啦  我愿意和你约会
<8-17,Stuart>Yes, I'll go out with you.

290
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,870
<8-18,Amy>我瞬间理解了那兔子的感受
<8-18,Amy>Suddenly, the rabbit thing makes sense.

291
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:58,320
<9-1,Leonard>谢尔顿  想不到你居然想来运动酒吧
<9-1,Leonard>I'm surprised you wanted to go to a sports bar, Sheldon.

292
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,390
<9-2,Sheldon>看看这些水泡
<9-2,Sheldon>Look at this blister.

293
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:03,690
<9-2,Sheldon>不管你怎么想  我们现在是运动健儿了
<9-2,Sheldon>Like it or not, we're athletes now.

294
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:06,160
<9-2,Sheldon>再说了  酒吧才是适合我的所在
<9-2,Sheldon>Besides, a bar is where I belong.

295
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,060
<9-2,Sheldon>我遇到了妞的问题
<9-2,Sheldon>I'm having female problems.

296
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:11,200
<9-3,Leonard>如果你暴脾气又容易水肿  我知道原因[月经]
<9-3,Leonard>If you're cranky and retaining water, I have a theory.

297
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:15,560
<9-4,Howard>谢尔顿  与其想着艾米和其他人约会
<9-4,Howard>Sheldon, instead of focusing on Amy dating other guys,

298
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,480
<9-4,Howard>也许你应该试着约一下其他女孩
<9-4,Howard>maybe you should start thinking about dating another girl.

299
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,190
<9-5,Sheldon>你疯了吗
<9-5,Sheldon>That's ridiculous.

300
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:20,940
<9-5,Sheldon>为什么
<9-5,Sheldon>Why?

301
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,470
<9-6,Raj>你以前还觉得自己永远不会和人交往
<9-6,Raj>You never thought you'd end up in a relationship,

302
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:23,640
<9-6,Raj>结果你遇到了艾米
<9-6,Raj>and then you met Amy.

303
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,400
<9-6,Raj>也许世界上还有其他适合你的人呢
<9-6,Raj>Maybe there's someone else out there for you.

304
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:29,650
<9-7,Sheldon>是的  可是佩妮结婚了  博纳黛特也结婚了
<9-7,Sheldon>True, but Penny's married, and so is Bernadette.

305
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:32,700
<9-7,Sheldon>而你女友的红发白皮肤
<9-7,Sheldon>And your girlfriend has red hair and white skin,

306
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,850
<9-7,Sheldon>会激起我的小丑恐惧症
<9-7,Sheldon>which really rubs up against my clown phobia.

307
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,600
<9-8,Leonard>也许你应该考虑一下
<9-8,Leonard>Maybe you should consider women

308
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,300
<9-8,Leonard>除了死党的伴侣之外的
<9-8,Leonard>who aren't in serious relationships

309
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,270
<9-8,Leonard>其他女性
<9-8,Leonard>with your closest friends?

310
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,990
<9-9,Sheldon>有一个前列腺医师  可我还生着她的气呢
<9-9,Sheldon>There's that prostate doctor, but I'm still mad at her.

311
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,920
<9-9,Sheldon>那有个女的
<9-9,Sheldon>Oh, there's a woman.

312
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,190
<9-9,Sheldon>我要让她当我女友
<9-9,Sheldon>Oh, I'll make her my girlfriend.

313
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,350
<9-10,Raj>在酒吧里追求陌生女人  通常会失败
<9-10,Raj>Walking up to a strange woman in a bar usually doesn't work.

314
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:59,110
<9-11,Sheldon>你忘了一件事
<9-11,Sheldon>You're forgetting something.

315
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:01,150
<9-11,Sheldon>姑娘们都爱运动员
<9-11,Sheldon>Ladies love jocks.

316
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,990
<9-12,Raj>他是喝了几口壮了怂人胆的啤酒
<9-12,Raj>How many sips of that beer did he have?

317
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:05,850
<9-14,Howard>-三口  -天啊
<9-14,Howard>- Three. - Oh, boy.

318
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:12,160
<9-15,Sheldon>打扰一下  我现在处于分手恢复期
<9-15,Sheldon>Excuse me. I'm recovering from a recent breakup,

319
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,510
<9-15,Sheldon>有人跟我说  跟另一个女人约会
<9-15,Sheldon>and I'm told asking out another woman

320
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:15,780
<9-15,Sheldon>也许会好受一些
<9-15,Sheldon>might make me feel better.

321
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:18,530
<9-15,Sheldon>如小智对皮卡丘所说的
<9-15,Sheldon>And as Ash Ketchum said to Pikachu,

322
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:20,940
<9-15,Sheldon>"就决定是你了"
<9-15,Sheldon>"I choose you."

323
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,400
<9-16,Woman>什么
<9-16,Woman>What?

324
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,450
<9-17,Sheldon>《口袋妖怪》的哏
<9-17,Sheldon>It's a Pokemon reference.

325
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:26,200
<9-18,Woman>我不知道那是什么意思
<9-18,Woman>I don't know what that means.

326
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,100
<9-19,Sheldon>对的时间遇见错的人
<9-19,Sheldon>Well, we gave it a shot.

327
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,360
<9-19,Sheldon>那你呢
<9-19,Sheldon>How about you?

328
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:34,780
<9-20,Older woman>我结婚了  都当外婆了
<9-20,Older woman>I'm married, and I'm her grandmother.

329
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:37,100
<9-21,Sheldon>错的时间遇见对的人
<9-21,Sheldon>Ah, what might have been.

330
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:42,380
<9-21,Sheldon>而你  代我向你马戏团的朋友们问好[红发白肤]
<9-21,Sheldon>And you, give my regards to Barnum and Bailey.

331
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:48,700
<10-1,Bernadette>斯图尔特简直像被拒绝专业户
<10-1,Bernadette>Stuart took that rejection like a pro.

332
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,640
<10-2,Penny>毕竟摄乳镜头拍得到他  不能暴怒
<10-2,Penny>Well, he knew he was on the breast cam.

333
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,750
<10-3,Amy>我没有过太多拒绝男人的经历
<10-3,Amy>I don't have much experience turning men down.

334
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,230
<10-3,Amy>不是很有意思
<10-3,Amy>It wasn't so much fun.

335
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,730
<10-4,Bernadette>你习惯就好了
<10-4,Bernadette>Oh, you get used to it.

336
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:00,840
<10-4,Bernadette>有的男人  你得一而再再而三地拒绝他
<10-4,Bernadette>Some guys you have to turn down over and over.

337
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,990
<10-5,Penny>或有时我们就嫁给他了事
<10-5,Penny>And sometimes we marry them anyway.

338
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,050
<10-6,Amy (Phone text sound)>奇了怪了
<10-6,Amy (Phone text sound)>Well, this is weird.

339
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:13,340
<10-8,Amy>-怎么了  -巴里·克瑞普吉约我出去
<10-8,Amy>- What? - Barry Kripke just asked me out.

340
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,870
<10-9,Bernadette>瞧你真行啊  一日两鸟
<10-9,Bernadette>Look at you-- two guys in one day!

341
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:20,330
<10-10,Penny>我就说修眉能改运吧
<10-10,Penny>I told you things would change if you plucked your eyebrows!

342
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,010
<10-11,Bernadette>他怎么说
<10-11,Bernadette>What did he say?

343
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:25,780
<10-12,Amy>"你好吗
<10-12,Amy>"Hi, how are you? I was wondering

344
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:29,450
<10-12,Amy>哪天下班以后一起去喝杯东西好吗"
<10-12,Amy>if you'd like to get a drink after work sometime."

345
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:31,050
<10-13,Penny>你要怎么做
<10-13,Penny>Well, what are you gonna do?

346
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:32,770
<10-13,Penny>不知道
<10-13,Penny>I don't know.

347
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:35,740
<10-14,Amy>我之前有想过以后肯定会跟别人约会
<10-14,Amy>I guess I assumed that I would eventually date other people,

348
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:38,120
<10-14,Amy>只是我没想到会这么快
<10-14,Amy>but this is happening so fast.

349
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,620
<10-15,Bernadette>能有什么损失吗
<10-15,Bernadette>What can it hurt?

350
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,560
<10-16,Amy>我希望下个约会对象
<10-16,Amy>Well, I was hoping the next person I dated

351
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,910
<10-16,Amy>能少像谢尔顿一点
<10-16,Amy>would be a little less like Sheldon.

352
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,280
<10-17,Bernadette>你是说不要科学家吗
<10-17,Bernadette>You mean, not a scientist?

353
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,600
<10-18,Penny>她说的应该是不要怪胎
<10-18,Penny>I think she means not a weirdo.

354
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,170
<10-19,Bernadette>你对他有好感吗
<10-19,Bernadette>Are you attracted to him?

355
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,380
<10-20,Amy>不知道
<10-20,Amy>I don't know.

356
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:55,010
<10-21,Penny>那你想象一下他裸体的样子  什么感觉
<10-21,Penny>All right, well, what happens if you imagine him naked?

357
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:56,650
<10-22,Amy>用不着想象
<10-22,Amy>Oh, I don't have to imagine it.

358
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,700
<11-1,Sheldon>我身上的味道好奇怪
<11-1,Sheldon>I smell funny.

359
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,430
<11-1,Sheldon>尝起来咸咸的
<11-1,Sheldon>I taste salty.

360
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,820
<11-2,Leonard>你就是运动出了点汗
<11-2,Leonard>You're just sweaty from exercise.

361
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,820
<11-3,Sheldon>还蛮美味的
<11-3,Sheldon>And kind of delicious.

362
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:20,190
<11-3,Sheldon>好奇要舔多少下才能舔到我的中心[棒棒糖]
<11-3,Sheldon>I wonder how many licks it would take to get to the center of me.

363
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,600
<11-4,Leonard>医生的一根金手指  就能破"门"而入
<11-4,Leonard>I know it only takes one doctor's finger.

364
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,420
<11-5,Amy>你好
<11-5,Amy>Hello.

365
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,770
<11-5,Amy>你好
<11-5,Amy>Hello.

366
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,790
<11-7,Leonard>我们走  你们慢谈
<11-7,Leonard>We should let you guys talk.

367
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,010
<11-8,Bernadette>对
<11-8,Bernadette>Yeah.

368
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:35,060
<11-9,Sheldon>你们不用离开
<11-9,Sheldon>You don't have to leave.

369
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,700
<11-10,Leonard>瞧我飞速飘走

370
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:40,190
<11-11,Amy>伯纳黛特  你还要开车送我呢
<11-11,Amy>Uh, Bernadette, you're my ride.

371
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:41,660
<11-12,Bernadette>自己走路

376
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,880
<11-16,Sheldon>挺简单的
<11-16,Sheldon>It was pretty easy.

377
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:00,150
<11-16,Sheldon>应该是我"数学竞技"的背景有所助益
<11-16,Sheldon>And I think my background in "mathletics" helped.

378
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:03,290
<11-16,Sheldon>巴里·克瑞普吉也在
<11-16,Sheldon>Barry Kripke was there.

383
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,130
<11-18,Sheldon>但别陷太深
<11-18,Sheldon>But don't get too attached to him.

384
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:17,640
<11-18,Sheldon>再过2年又364天  他就死翘翘了
<11-18,Sheldon>In two years, 364 days, he's a dead man.

<11-21,Amy>我不知道你想跟人约会呢
<11-21,Amy>I didn't know you were interested in dating.

389
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:34,070
<11-22,Sheldon>听说这有助于走出失恋阴霾
<11-22,Sheldon>I've been told it's a good way to move on.

390
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,860
<11-22,Sheldon>这样啊

<12-3,Bernadette>你的运动手环怎么显示昨天你跑了280公里
