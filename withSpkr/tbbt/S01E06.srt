1
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:11,450
<1-1,Raj>好吧  如果没人开口那我就直说了
<1-1,Raj>Okay, if no one else will say it, I will.

2
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,740
<1-1,Raj>我们在彩弹枪方面糟透了
<1-1,Raj>We really suck at paintball.

3
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,200
<1-2,Howard>这真是太丢人了
<1-2,Howard>That was absolutely humiliating.

4
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:20,000
<1-3,Leonard>拜托  胜败乃兵家常事嘛
<1-3,Leonard>Come on, some battles you win, some battles you lose.

8
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:31,220
<1-5,Leonard>那些犹太小伙子还是很厉害的
<1-5,Leonard>Those was some fairly savage preadolescent jews.

9
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,180
<1-6,Sheldon>不  我们的失败源于我们自己的无能
<1-6,Sheldon>No, we were annihilated by our own incompetence

10
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,660
<1-6,Sheldon>以及某些人没有能够
<1-6,Sheldon>And the inability of some people to follow

11
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:40,970
<1-7,Leonard>-听从指挥  -谢尔顿  别再讲了

<1-8,Sheldon>No, I want to talk about the fact that wolowitz shot me in the back.

13
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:49,470
<1-9,Howard>我有理由的  那时你正把我们领向灾难
<1-9,Howard>I shot you for a good reason. you were leading us into disaster.

14
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:52,720
<1-10,Sheldon>我的指令清晰简洁
<1-10,Sheldon>I was giving clear, concise orders.

15
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:56,590

<2-7,Leonard>我们都有其它服装  我们可以改嘛
<2-7,Leonard>We all have other costumes. We can change.

61
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:27,070

<2-8,Raj>Or we could walk right behind each other all night

62
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:29,390
<2-8,Raj>看起来就会像一个走得特别快的人

<3-3,Raj>"不不  你只能做印度神"
<3-3,Raj>"no, no, raj has to be an indian god."

73
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,520
<3-3,Raj>这是种族歧视
<3-3,Raj>That's racism.

74
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,930
<3-3,Raj>我是说  看看沃尔维茨
<3-3,Raj>I mean look at wolowitz.

75
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:22,600
<3-3,Raj>他不是英格兰人  但他打扮成了彼得·潘

77
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,790
<3-3,Raj>但他很显然是多普勒效应
<3-3,Raj>But he's obviously the doppler effect.

78
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,550
<3-4,Howard>我不是彼得·潘

80
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:37,100
<3-5,Raj>真的?  我觉得是彼得·潘
<3-5,Raj>Really? because I sawpeter pan,

81
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,670
<3-5,Raj>而且你穿的很像凯西·瑞比(演过彼得·潘的演员)
<3-5,Raj>And you're dressed exactly like cathy rigby.

82
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,060
<3-5,Raj>她比你大一号  但样子基本差不多  伙计
<3-5,Raj>She was a little bigger than you, but it's basically the same look, man.

<3-6,Leonard>谢尔顿  在去派对之前我要跟你谈一下
<3-6,Leonard>There's something I want to talk to you about before we go to the party.

<3-7,Sheldon>我不管会不会有人看出来
<3-7,Sheldon>I don't care if anybody gets it.

85
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,470
<3-7,Sheldon>我一定要穿成多普勒效应
<3-7,Sheldon>I'm going as the doppler effect.

86
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,080
<3-9,Sheldon>-不是这个  -如果必要的话  我可以现场演示
<3-9,Sheldon>-no, it's not that. -if I have to, I can demonstrate.

87
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:01,810
<3-10,Leonard>太棒了
<3-10,Leonard>Terrific.

88

<3-10,Leonard>融入她社交圈中的我
<3-10,Leonard>In the context of her social group,

90
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:12,080
<3-10,Leonard>我希望你今晚别让我出丑
<3-10,Leonard>And I need you not to embarrass me tonight.

91
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,400
<3-11,Sheldon>你说让你出丑是什么意思?
<3-11,Sheldon>What exactly do you mean by embarrass you?

92
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,560
<3-12,Leonard>比如说  今晚
<3-12,Leonard>For example, tonight,

93
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,360
<3-12,Leonard>没必要让人知道我的中间名是里克
<3-12,Leonard>No one needs to know that my middle name is Leakey.

94
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,860
<3-13,Sheldon>但这没什么好丢脸的
<3-13,Sheldon>But there's nothing embarrassing about that.

95
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:27,070
<3-13,Sheldon>你爸爸与那个伟大的人类学家路易斯·里克一起工作
<3-13,Sheldon>Your father worked with Louis Leakey, a great anthropologist.

96
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,140
<3-13,Sheldon>这跟你的尿床一点关系也没有
<3-13,Sheldon>It had nothing to do with your bed-wetting.

97
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:34,420
<3-14,Leonard>我要说的只是这是一个大好机会
<3-14,Leonard>All I'm saying is that this party is the perfect opportunity

98
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:37,490
<3-14,Leonard>让潘妮看到我成了她社交圈中的一员
<3-14,Leonard>For Penny to see me as a member of her peer group,

99
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,800
<3-14,Leonard>我们可能会成为好朋友  或者更进一步
<3-14,Leonard>A potential close friend, and perhaps more,

100
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,310
<3-14,Leonard>我不想看起来像个呆子
<3-14,Leonard>And I don't want to look like a dork.

101
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:56,430
<4-1,Howard>注意了  伙计们

<4-6,Penny>是啊  可是通常你说七点开始的话
<4-6,Penny>Yeah, I mean, when you start a party at 7:00,

108

113
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:35,540

114
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,820
<4-11,Sheldon>那么服装展示什么时候开始?

00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:58,480
<4-14,Penny>但是不会有展示  评委或者奖品的
<4-14,Penny>But there aren't going to be any parades or judges or prizes.

121
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,370
<4-15,Sheldon>这场派对会很糟糕的
<4-15,Sheldon>This party is just going to suck.

122
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,040
<4-16,Penny>不!  拜托  会很有趣的
<4-16,Penny>No! come on, it's going to be fun,

123
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:06,170
<4-16,Penny>你们看上去那么棒  看你  托尔
<4-16,Penny>And you all look great. I mean, look at you, thor,

124
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,350
<4-16,Penny>还有...
<4-16,Penny>And, oh,

125
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,550
<4-16,Penny>彼得·潘  这太可爱了
<4-16,Penny>Peter pan. that's so cute.

126
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,220
<4-17,Leonard>-事实上  他是罗宾汉  -我是彼得·潘
<4-17,Leonard>-actually, he's robin hood. -i'm peter pan.

127
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,310
<4-18,Howard>我还带了一把有你名字的魔法粉
<4-18,Howard>And I got a handful of pixie dust with your name on it.

128
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,410
<4-19,Penny>你不是吧
<4-19,Penny>No, you don't.

129
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,540
<4-19,Penny>谢尔顿扮的是什么?
<4-19,Penny>What's Sheldon supposed to be?

130
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:26,820
<4-20,Leonard>他扮的是多普勒效应
<4-20,Leonard>He's the doppler effect.

131
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:29,680
<4-21,Sheldon>这是由于波源和观察者之间的相对运动
<4-21,Sheldon>Yes. it's the apparent change in the frequency of a wave

132
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,700
<4-21,Sheldon>而引起的波频率的明显变化
<4-21,Sheldon>Caused by relative motion between the source of the wave and the observer.

133
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:39,200
<4-22,Penny>当然  我明白了  多普勒效应
<4-22,Penny>Oh, sure, I see it now. the doppler effect.

134
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,330
<4-22,Penny>好吧  我要去洗澡了
<4-22,Penny>All right, I got to shower.

135
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:43,230
<4-22,Penny>你们...自己好好玩
<4-22,Penny>You guys... make yourselves comfortable.

136
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,730
<4-22,Penny>好的
<4-22,Penny>Ok.

137
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:47,850
<4-24,Sheldon>看到了吧?  其他人能明白的
<4-24,Sheldon>See? people get it.

138
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,310
<4-25,Raj>我用奥丁(北欧神话中的主神)的胡子起誓  这太好吃了
<4-25,Raj>By odin's beard, this is good chex mix.

139
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,570
<4-26,Howard>不了  谢谢  有花生
<4-26,Howard>No, thanks. peanuts.

140
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,980
<4-26,Howard>穿这么紧我可不能变胖
<4-26,Howard>I can't afford to swell up in these tights.

141
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:11,860
<4-27,Sheldon>我不明白
<4-27,Sheldon>I'm confused.

142
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:15,130
<4-27,Sheldon>没有服装展示的话  我们在这干嘛
<4-27,Sheldon>If there's no costume parade, what are we doing here?

143
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:18,480
<4-28,Leonard>进行社交活动  认识一些新的人
<4-28,Leonard>We're socializing, meeting new people.

144
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:20,280
<4-29,Sheldon>用传心术?
<4-29,Sheldon>Telepathically?

145
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,750
<4-30,Penny (crossing the room in a cat costume, speaking to someone off-screen)>嗨  你什么时候来的?
<4-30,Penny (crossing the room in a cat costume, speaking to someone off-screen)>Oh, hey, when did you get here?

146
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:28,310
<4-31,Raj>潘妮那件猫女服是我见过最丑的
<4-31,Raj>Penny is wearing the worst catwoman costume I've ever seen.

147
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,140
<4-31,Raj>连哈莉·贝瑞的都不如
<4-31,Raj>And that includes halle berry's.

148
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:33,210
<4-32,Leonard>她不是猫女  就是只普通猫
<4-32,Leonard>She's not catwoman. she's just a generic cat.

149
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:35,300
<4-33,Sheldon>这种糟糕装扮的产生
<4-33,Sheldon>And that's the kind of sloppy costuming

150
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:38,180
<4-33,Sheldon>就是因为缺乏规定和竞争
<4-33,Sheldon>Which results from a lack of rules and competion.

151
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:42,520
<4-34,Howard>伙计们  看看那个性感的小护士
<4-34,Howard>Hey, guys, check out the sexy nurse.

152
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:47,930
<4-34,Howard>我相信是时候采取行动了
<4-34,Howard>I believe it's time for me to turn my head and cough.

153
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,620
<4-35,Raj>你要怎么做
<4-35,Raj>What is your move?

154
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:52,750
<4-36,Howard>我要采用镜子战术
<4-36,Howard>I'm going to use the mirror technique.

155
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,200
<4-36,Howard>她理头发  我也理头发
<4-36,Howard>She brushes her hair back, I brush my hair back...

156
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,380
<4-36,Howard>她耸肩  我也耸肩  潜意识里她就会想
<4-36,Howard>She shrugs, I shrug. subconsciously she's thinking,

157
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,950
<4-36,Howard>"我们是同步的  我们属于彼此"
<4-36,Howard>"we're in sync. we belong together."

158
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,570
<4-37,Leonard>你从哪学的这一套?
<4-37,Leonard>Where do you get this stuff?

159
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:04,900
<4-38,Howard>心理学期刊  国际性研究
<4-38,Howard>You know, psychology journals, internet research,

160
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:08,770
<4-38,Howard>而且在vh-1有个好节目教你怎么追女孩
<4-38,Howard>And there's this great show on vh-1 about how to pick up girls.

161
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,470
<4-39,Raj>我要是像他那么自信就好了
<4-39,Raj>If only I had his confidence.

162
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,840
<4-39,Raj>我跟女人说话都很困难
<4-39,Raj>I have such difficulty speaking to women,

163
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:17,460
<4-39,Raj>呆在女人身边也是...
<4-39,Raj>Or around women...

164
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,910
<4-39,Raj>有时还包括阴柔的男人
<4-39,Raj>Or at times even effeminate men.

165
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:23,430
<4-40,Howard>如果这个听诊器好用的话
<4-40,Howard>If that's a working stethoscope,

166
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:26,290
<4-40,Howard>也许你想听听我击鼓一样的心跳声?
<4-40,Howard>Maybe you'd like to hear my heart skip a beat?

167
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:28,390
<4-41,Nurse Costume Girl>不了  谢谢
<4-41,Nurse Costume Girl>No, thanks.

168
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:31,990
<4-42,Howard>不  认真的  我有短期原发性心律不齐
<4-42,Howard>No, seriously, you can. I have transient idiopathic arrhythmia.

169
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,470
<4-43,Leonard>我想了解潘妮的朋友  我只是...
<4-43,Leonard>I want to get to know Penny's friends, I just...

170
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,190
<4-43,Leonard>我不知道该怎么跟她们说话
<4-43,Leonard>I don't know how to talk to these people.

171
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,700
<4-44,Sheldon>我可能会帮上忙
<4-44,Sheldon>Well, I actually might be able to help.

172
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,590
<4-45,Leonard>怎么帮?
<4-45,Leonard>How so?

173
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:51,270
<4-46,Sheldon>像珍·古德观察黑猩猩一样
<4-46,Sheldon>Like jane goodall observing the apes,

174
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:54,790
<4-46,Sheldon>我发现一开始她们的行动是混乱无序的
<4-46,Sheldon>I initially saw their interactions as confusing and unstructured.

175
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,360
<4-46,Sheldon>但是慢慢就有章可循了
<4-46,Sheldon>But patterns emerge.

176
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,410
<4-46,Sheldon>她们有自己独特的语言
<4-46,Sheldon>They have their own language, if you will.

177
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,680
<4-47,Leonard>继续
<4-47,Leonard>Go on.

178
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:05,800
<4-48,Sheldon>新来的人接近一伙已经在聊的人
<4-48,Sheldon>It seems that the newcomer approaches the existing group

179
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:08,530
<4-48,Sheldon>然后说"看我都神志不清了"
<4-48,Sheldon>With the greeting, "how wasted am i?"

180
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:11,740
<4-48,Sheldon>接着就有一阵类似"伙计"这样的欢迎声
<4-48,Sheldon>Which is met with an approving chorus of "dude."

181
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,400
<4-49,Leonard>然后呢?
<4-49,Leonard>Then what happens?

182
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,120
<4-50,Sheldon>我就只观察到这些
<4-50,Sheldon>That's as far as I've gotten.

183
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,770
<4-51,Leonard>这太可笑了
<4-51,Leonard>This is ridiculous.

184
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,000
<4-52,Sheldon>-我要去插话了  -好运
<4-52,Sheldon>-i'm jumping in. -good luck.

185
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,600
<4-53,Leonard>不  你跟我一起去
<4-53,Leonard>No, you're coming with me.

186
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,510
<4-54,Sheldon>我可不这么想
<4-54,Sheldon>Oh, I hardly think so.

187
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:25,770
<4-55,Leonard>拜托
<4-55,Leonard>Come on.

188
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:28,150
<4-56,Sheldon>你不是怕我让你出丑么?
<4-56,Sheldon>Aren't you afraid I'll embarrass you?

189
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:30,840
<4-57,Leonard>是的  但我需要一个翼人(指要人陪同)
<4-57,Leonard>Yes; but I need a wing man.

190
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,700
<4-58,Sheldon>好吧  但是如果我们非要用飞行做隐喻的话
<4-58,Sheldon>All right, but if we're going to use flight metaphors,

191
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:38,100
<4-58,Sheldon>我更适合做联邦航空局事故分析处的人
<4-58,Sheldon>I'm much more suited to being the guy from the faa analyzing wreckage.

192
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:43,230
<4-60,Leonard>- 你们好  -你好
<4-60,Leonard>Hi. Hi. Hello.

193
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,480
<4-62,Girl>你们扮的是什么?
<4-62,Girl>So what are you supposed to be?

194
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:48,740
<4-63,Sheldon>-我?  -我给你个暗示
<4-63,Sheldon>Me? I'll give you a hint.

195
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,880
<4-64,Girl>玩具火车?
<4-64,Girl>A choo-choo train?

196
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,030
<4-65,Sheldon>接近了
<4-65,Sheldon>Close!

197
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,810
<4-66,Girl>一辆大脑有病的玩具火车?
<4-66,Girl>A brain damaged choo-choo train?

198
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:05,360
<4-67,Girl in Butterfly Costume (dropping onto sofa next to Raj)>看我都神志不清了
<4-67,Girl in Butterfly Costume (dropping onto sofa next to Raj)>How wasted am i?

199
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,840
<4-69,Girl>我还是不明白
<4-69,Girl>I still don't get it.

200
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:19,860
<4-70,Sheldon>我是多普勒效应
<4-70,Sheldon>I'm the doppler effect.

201
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,250
<4-71,Girl>如果这是一种学习障碍的话
<4-71,Girl>If that's some sort of learning disability,

202
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,120
<4-71,Girl>我想这可真够迟钝的
<4-71,Girl>I think it's very insensitive.

203
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,910
<4-72,Leonard>为什么不跟人说你是只斑马呢?
<4-72,Leonard>Why don't you just tell people you're a zebra?

204
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,410
<4-73,Sheldon>为什么不跟人说你是七个小矮人之一?
<4-73,Sheldon>Why don't you just tell people you're one of the seven dwarves?

205
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,720
<4-74,Leonard>因为我是弗拉多
<4-74,Leonard>Because I'm frodo.

206
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:36,350
<4-75,Sheldon>是啊  很好  因为我是多普勒效应
<4-75,Sheldon>Yes, well, I'm the doppler effect.

207
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,100
<4-77,Sheldon>-不  不  -怎么?
<4-77,Sheldon>-oh, no. -what?

208
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,340
<4-78,Leonard>那是潘妮的前男友
<4-78,Leonard>That's Penny's ex-boyfriend.

209
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,950
<4-79,Sheldon>你觉得他来这里干嘛
<4-79,Sheldon>What do you suppose he's doing here?

210
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,930
<4-79,Sheldon>除了扰乱本地的重力场之外?
<4-79,Sheldon>Besides disrupting the local gravity field.

211
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:51,310
<4-80,Leonard>如果他再健壮一点  月亮都会绕他运行
<4-80,Leonard>If he were any bigger, he'd have moons orbiting him.

212
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,990
<4-81,Sheldon>呦  正是
<4-81,Sheldon>Oh, snap.

213
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,240
<4-81,Sheldon>那么我猜我们该走了
<4-81,Sheldon>So, I guess we'll be leaving now.

214
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,930
<4-82,Leonard>为什么我们要走?
<4-82,Leonard>Why should we leave?

215
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:02,250
<4-82,Leonard>是他闯进了派对  潘妮根本不想他来
<4-82,Leonard>For all we know he crashed the party and Penny doesn't even want him here.

216
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,860
<4-83,Sheldon>你还有一个替补的假设么?
<4-83,Sheldon>You have a backup hypothesis?

217
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:08,590
<4-84,Leonard>也许他们只是想做朋友
<4-84,Leonard>Maybe they want to be friends.

218
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,440
<4-85,Sheldon>或许是她想做朋友
<4-85,Sheldon>Or maybe she wants to be friends

219
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,470
<4-85,Sheldon>而他想要的不只如此
<4-85,Sheldon>And he wants something more.

220
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:14,760
<4-86,Leonard>那么他和我就是站在同一高度的
<4-86,Leonard>Then he and I are on equal ground.

221
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,440
<4-87,Sheldon>是啊  但是你比他更接近地面
<4-87,Sheldon>Yes, but you're much closer to it than he is.

222
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:21,820
<4-88,Leonard>听着  如果这是1万5千年以前
<4-88,Leonard>Look, if this was 15,000 years ago,

223
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,800
<4-88,Leonard>凭他的体型和力量
<4-88,Leonard>By virtue of his size and strength,

224
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:26,320
<4-88,Leonard>科特想挑哪个女人都可以
<4-88,Leonard>Kurt would be entitled to his choice of female partners.

225
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:29,790
<4-89,Sheldon>还有男人  动物  大号原始茄子
<4-89,Sheldon>And male partners, animal partners, large primordial eggplants--

226
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,200
<4-89,Sheldon>几乎所有他想要的东西
<4-89,Sheldon>Pretty much whatever tickled his fancy.

227
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:35,640
<4-90,Leonard>但是我们的社会已经发生了角色转换
<4-90,Leonard>Yes, but our society has undergone a paradigm shift.

228
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,680
<4-90,Leonard>在信息时代  谢尔顿
<4-90,Leonard>In the information age,Sheldon.

229
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,740
<4-90,Leonard>你我才是优等男性
<4-90,Leonard>You and I are the alpha males.

230
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:42,460
<4-90,Leonard>-我们不应该退缩  -正是
<4-90,Leonard>-we shouldn't have to back down. -true.

231
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:45,390
<4-91,Sheldon>你为什么不给他发个短信看他是否退缩?
<4-91,Sheldon>Why don't you text him that and see if he backs down?

232
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:47,690
<4-91,Sheldon>不
<4-91,Sheldon>no.

233
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,160
<4-92,Leonard>我要当面维护我的地位
<4-92,Leonard>I'm going to assert my dominance face-to-face.

234
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,010
<4-93,Sheldon>当面?  你要等他坐下来吗
<4-93,Sheldon>Face-to-face? are you going to wait for him to sit down,

235
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:57,070
<4-93,Sheldon>或者你要站在咖啡桌上?
<4-93,Sheldon>Or are you going to stand on the coffee table?

236
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:00,760
<4-94,Leonard>你好  潘妮  你好  科特
<4-94,Leonard>Hello, Penny. hello, Kurt.

237
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,880
<4-95,Penny>伙计们  玩得开心吗
<4-95,Penny>Hey, guys, are you having a good time?

238
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,390
<4-96,Sheldon>根据人们对我服装的反应
<4-96,Sheldon>Given the reaction to my costume,

239
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:07,830
<4-96,Sheldon>这场派对是对美国教育体制的严厉控诉
<4-96,Sheldon>This party is a scathing indictment of the american education system.

240
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,450
<4-97,Kurt>怎么  你是只斑马  对吗
<4-97,Kurt>What, you're a zebra, right?

241
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:13,370
<4-98,Sheldon>又一个低能儿童
<4-98,Sheldon>Yet another child left behind.

242
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,740
<4-99,Kurt>你是什么  精灵吗?
<4-99,Kurt>What are you supposed to be, an elf?

243
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:18,400
<4-100,Leonard>不  我扮的是哈比人
<4-100,Leonard>No, I'm a hobbit.

244
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:19,930
<4-101,Kurt>有什么区别?
<4-101,Kurt>What's the difference?

245
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,300
<4-102,Leonard>哈比人是居住在中土世界  生命有限的矮人
<4-102,Leonard>A hobbit is a mortal halfling inhabitant of middle earth,

246
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,540
<4-102,Leonard>而精灵是一种永生的高大战士
<4-102,Leonard>Whereas an elf is an immortal, tall warrior.

247
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,920
<4-103,Kurt>那你为什么要做哈比人?
<4-103,Kurt>So why the hell would you want to be a hobbit?

248
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,720
<4-104,Sheldon>因为他既不高大也不会永生
<4-104,Sheldon>Because he's neither tall nor immortal

249
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,680
<4-104,Sheldon>而我们没人可以做闪电侠
<4-104,Sheldon>And none of us could be the flash.

250
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,740
<4-105,Kurt>好吧  不管怎样  你为什么不走开呢?
<4-105,Kurt>Well, whatever. why don't you go hop off on a quest?

251
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,210
<4-106,Leonard>我在跟潘妮说话
<4-106,Leonard>I'm talking to penny here.

252
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,270
<4-106,Leonard>我想我们都在跟潘妮说话
<4-106,Leonard>I think we're all talking to penny here.

253
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:42,920
<4-107,Sheldon>我没有  无意冒犯
<4-107,Sheldon>I'm not. no offense.

254
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,460
<4-108,Kurt>好吧  也许你没听到
<4-108,Kurt>Okay, maybe you didn't hear me.

255
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:47,760
<4-109,Penny>-走开  -别这样  科特  友好点
<4-109,Penny>-go away. -all right, Kurt, be nice.

256
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,240
<4-110,Kurt>我很友好
<4-110,Kurt>Oh, I am being nice.

257
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,000
<4-110,Kurt>对吧  小兄弟?
<4-110,Kurt>Right, little buddy?

258
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,930
<4-111,Penny>-科特  -好吧
<4-111,Penny>Kurt. Ok.

259
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:58,790
<4-112,Leonard>我明白你企图用武力恐吓我
<4-112,Leonard>I understand your impulse to try to physically intimidate me.

260
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:01,590
<4-112,Leonard>我是说  你在智力水准上没法跟我比
<4-112,Leonard>I mean, you can't compete with me on an intellectual level

261
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,940
<4-112,Leonard>所以你被迫只能变得像动物似的
<4-112,Leonard>So you're driven to animalistic puffery.

262
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,010
<4-113,Kurt>你说我是只动物?
<4-113,Kurt>You calling me a puffy animal?

263
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:08,850
<4-114,Penny>当然没有  没有  他没有
<4-114,Penny>Of course not. no, he's not.

264
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,320
<4-114,Penny>你没有  是吧  里奥纳德?
<4-114,Penny>You're not, right, Leonard?

265
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,850
<4-115,Leonard>没有  我是说"动物似的"
<4-115,Leonard>No, I said "animalistic."

266
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:15,630
<4-115,Leonard>当然  我们都是动物  但是
<4-115,Leonard>Of course we're all animals, but,

267
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,880
<4-115,Leonard>我们中有些人在进化树上爬得更高一点
<4-115,Leonard>Some of us have climbed a little higher on the evolutionary tree.

268
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:21,000
<4-116,Sheldon>如果他听明白了  你就有麻烦了
<4-116,Sheldon>If he understands that, you're in trouble.

269
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:23,390
<4-117,Kurt>你是说我没进化了?
<4-117,Kurt>So, what, I'm unevolved?

270
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:24,520
<4-118,Sheldon>你有麻烦了
<4-118,Sheldon>You're in trouble.

271
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:29,050
<4-119,Kurt>作为一个侏儒  你用的词还真够大的
<4-119,Kurt>You use a lot of big words for such a little dwarf.

272
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:30,450
<4-120,Penny>科特  拜托
<4-120,Penny>Okay, Kurt, please.

273
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:33,220
<4-121,Leonard>潘妮  没关系  我可以解决
<4-121,Leonard>Penny. It's okay. I can handle this.

274
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,100
<4-110,Kurt>我不是侏儒
<4-110,Kurt>I am not a dwarf,

275
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,010
<4-100,Leonard>我是哈比人
<4-100,Leonard>I'm a hobbit.

276
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:38,280
<4-100,Leonard>哈比人
<4-100,Leonard>A hobbit.

277
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,680
<4-121,Leonard>你大脑海马区里坏掉的神经元
<4-121,Leonard>Are misfiring neurons in your hippocampus preventing

278
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,610
<4-121,Leonard>阻碍了短期到长期记忆的转换吗
<4-121,Leonard>The conversion from short-term to long-term memory?

279
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:48,010
<4-122,Kurt>好吧  现在你惹火我了
<4-122,Kurt>Okay, now you're starting to make me mad.

280
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:52,310
<4-123,Leonard>一个发现自己拇指的人猿会说什么?
<4-123,Leonard>A homo habilis discovering his opposable thumbs says what?

281
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,140
<4-77,Sheldon>什么?
<4-77,Sheldon>What?

282
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,640
<4-125,Leonard>我想我已经把要点表达清楚了
<4-125,Leonard>I think I've made my point.

283
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:05,000
<4-126,Kurt>是吗  那我在你尖尖的小脑袋上留个点怎么样
<4-126,Kurt>Yeah? how about I make a point out of your pointy little head?

284
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,430
<4-127,Sheldon>我要提醒你  尽管我精神上完全支持你
<4-127,Sheldon>Let me remind you, while my moral support is absolute,

285
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,480
<4-127,Sheldon>但在肢体冲突上  我可是一点用也没有
<4-127,Sheldon>In a physical confrontation, I will be less than useless.

286
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,000
<4-128,Leonard>不会有冲突的
<4-128,Leonard>There's not going to be a confrontation.

287
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,930
<4-128,Leonard>事实上  我都怀疑他会不会拼"冲突"这单词
<4-128,Leonard>In fact, I doubt if he can even spell "confrontation."

288
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:20,610
<4-129,Kurt (physically lifting Leonard from the ground)>C-o-n...
<4-129,Kurt (physically lifting Leonard from the ground)>C-o-n...

289
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,230
<4-129,Kurt (physically lifting Leonard from the ground)>Frontation!
<4-129,Kurt (physically lifting Leonard from the ground)>Frontation!

290
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,300
<4-130,Penny>科特  马上放他下来
<4-130,Penny>Kurt, put him down this instant!

291
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,500
<4-131,Kurt>他先开始的
<4-131,Kurt>He started it!

292
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,340
<4-132,Penny>我才不管  我要这事结束  放他下来
<4-132,Penny>I don't care. I'm finishing it. put him down!

293
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:31,510
<4-132,Penny>好吧
<4-132,Penny>Fine.

294
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,530
<4-133,Kurt>你是个幸运的小矮精灵
<4-133,Kurt>You're one lucky little leprechaun.

295
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:38,970
<4-133,Kurt>他是个哈比人!
<4-133,Kurt>He's a hobbit!

296
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,630
<4-134,Sheldon>我挺你了
<4-134,Sheldon>I got your back.

297
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:43,170
<4-135,Penny>里奥纳德  你还好吗
<4-135,Penny>Leonard, are you okay?

298
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,600
<4-135,Penny>我很好
<4-135,Penny>Yeah, I'm fine.

299
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:50,010
<4-136,Leonard>派对很棒  谢谢邀请
<4-136,Leonard>It's a good party, thanks for having us.

300
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:52,030
<4-136,Leonard>只是有点晚了  所以...
<4-136,Leonard>It's just getting a little late, so...

301
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:55,420
<4-137,Penny>好吧  没关系  谢谢你们能来
<4-137,Penny>Ok, all right, thank you for coming.

302
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:00,200
<4-138,Sheldon>万圣节快乐
<4-138,Sheldon>Happy halloween.

303
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:04,870
<4-138,Sheldon>希望这话能让你好过些
<4-138,Sheldon>If it's any consolation,

304
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:08,010
<4-138,Sheldon>我认为"人猿"那句确实很适合他
<4-138,Sheldon>I thought that homo habilis line really put him in his place.

305
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,600
<5-1,Leonard>那是什么?
<5-1,Leonard>What's that?

306
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:20,000
<5-2,Sheldon>茶
<5-2,Sheldon>Tea.

307
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:22,250
<5-2,Sheldon>当人们沮丧的时候
<5-2,Sheldon>When people are upset,

308
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:25,180
<5-2,Sheldon>传统上应该给他们一点热饮料
<5-2,Sheldon>The cultural convention is to bring them hot beverages.

309
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:32,970
<5-16,Leonard>好啦  好啦
<5-16,Leonard>There, there.

310
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,880
<5-2,Sheldon>你想谈谈吗
<5-2,Sheldon>You want to talk about it?

311
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,420
<5-3,Leonard>-不  -太好了
<5-3,Leonard>-no. -good.

312
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,690
<5-4,Sheldon>我能说的也只有"好啦  好啦"了
<5-4,Sheldon>"there, there" was really all I had.

313
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:46,730
<5-6,Sheldon>-晚安  谢尔顿  -晚安  里奥纳德
<5-6,Sheldon>-good night, Sheldon. -good night, Leonard.

314
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:54,910
<5-7,Penny (knocking on door and entering)>里奥纳德
<5-7,Penny (knocking on door and entering)>Leonard

315
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,010
<5-8,Leonard>潘妮
<5-8,Leonard>Hi, Penny.

316
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:58,210
<5-9,Penny>我只想确定你没事
<5-9,Penny>I just wanted to make sure you were okay.

317
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,500
<5-10,Leonard>我很好
<5-10,Leonard>I'm fine.

318
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:04,110
<5-11,Penny>我对刚刚发生的事情很抱歉
<5-11,Penny>I am so sorry about what happened.

319
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:05,620
<5-12,Leonard>那不是你的错
<5-12,Leonard>It's not your fault.

320
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,880
<5-12,Leonard>不  是我的错
<5-12,Leonard>Yes, it is.

321
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:10,140
<5-13,Penny>那就是我跟他分手的原因  他总是那样
<5-13,Penny>That's why I broke up with him. he always does stuff like that.

322
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,620
<5-14,Leonard>那他为什么来参加你的派对?
<5-14,Leonard>So why was he at your party?

323
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,750
<5-15,Penny>我上周偶然碰到了他
<5-15,Penny>I ran into him last week

324
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:22,390
<5-15,Penny>他道歉说他已经变了
<5-15,Penny>And he was just all apologetic about how he's changed.

325
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:24,870
<5-15,Penny>他不停地说啊说...
<5-15,Penny>And he was just going on and on and...

326
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:29,490
<5-15,Penny>我就信了  我真是个笨蛋  总是相信这样的人
<5-15,Penny>I believed him and I'm an idiot because I always believe guys like that.

327
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,170
<5-15,Penny>我不想回派对  因为他在那儿
<5-15,Penny>I can't go back to my party because he's there.

328
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,240
<5-15,Penny>你不会想听这些的  我很沮丧
<5-15,Penny>You don't want to hear this and I'm upset

329
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:36,300
<5-15,Penny>还喝醉了  我只想...
<5-15,Penny>And I'm really drunk and I just want to...

330
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:46,850
<5-16,Leonard>好啦  好啦
<5-16,Leonard>There, there.

331
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,700
<5-17,Penny>上帝  我做错了什么
<5-17,Penny>God, what is wrong with me?

332
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:54,660
<5-18,Leonard>什么都没有  你是完美的
<5-18,Leonard>Nothing, you're perfect.

333
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,960
<5-20,Leonard>-我不完美  -不  你是
<5-20,Leonard>-i'm not perfect. -yes, you are.

334
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:02,140
<5-21,Penny>你真的这么想吗
<5-21,Penny>You really think so, don't you?

335
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:17,390
<5-22,Leonard>潘妮
<5-22,Leonard>Penny.

336
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:18,650
<5-23,Penny>什么
<5-23,Penny>Yeah?

337
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,740
<5-24,Leonard>你今晚喝了多少?
<5-24,Leonard>How much have you had to drink tonight?

338
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:27,160
<5-25,Penny>就是...很多
<5-25,Penny>Just... a lot.

339
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:30,700
<5-26,Leonard>你确定你不是因为喝醉了酒
<5-26,Leonard>Are you sure that your being drunk

340
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,690
<5-26,Leonard>外加生科特的气
<5-26,Leonard>And your being angry with Kurt

341
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:35,160
<5-26,Leonard>现在才这样做吗
<5-26,Leonard>Doesn't have something to do with what's going on here?

342
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,480
<5-27,Penny>可能
<5-27,Penny>It might.

343
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,000
<5-27,Penny>你太聪明了
<5-27,Penny>Boy, you're really smart.

344
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:45,090
<5-28,Leonard>是啊  我是个怪才
<5-28,Leonard>Yeah, I'm a frickin' genius.

345
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:51,930
<5-29,Penny>里奥纳德  你太伟大了
<5-29,Penny>Leonard, you are so great.

346
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,160
<5-29,Penny>为什么所有男人不能都像你一样?
<5-29,Penny>Why can't all guys be like you?

347
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,900
<5-30,Leonard>因为如果那样的话  人类就会灭亡了
<5-30,Leonard>Because if all guys were like me, the human race couldn't survive.

348
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,880
<5-31,Penny>我该走了
<5-31,Penny>I should probably go.

<5-34,Leonard>没错  就是你看到的这样
<5-34,Leonard>That's right, you saw what you saw.

352
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:34,430
<5-34,Leonard>我们在夏尔(哈比人的住地)也是这样的
<5-34,Leonard>That's how we roll in the shire.

<6-1,Sheldon>就来了
<6-1,Sheldon>Coming.

354
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:52,010

<6-2,Howard>Hey, have you seen Koothrappali?

355
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:53,720
<6-3,Sheldon>他不在这里
<6-3,Sheldon>He's not here.

356
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,250
<6-3,Sheldon>也许被复仇者召唤去了
<6-3,Sheldon>Maybe the avengers summoned him.

357
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,960
<6-4,Howard>他不是漫画里伟大的托尔  只是原始古挪威神
<6-4,Howard>He's not the marvel comics thor, he's the original norse god.

<6-6,Howard>-我应该送他回家的  -我相信他没事的
<6-6,Howard>-i'm supposed to give him a ride home. -i'm sure he'll be fine.

360
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,840
<6-7,Sheldon>他有榔头
<6-7,Sheldon>He has his hammer.

361

<7-1,Butterfly Girl>我不得不说  你太棒了
<7-1,Butterfly Girl>I have to say, you are an amazing man.
