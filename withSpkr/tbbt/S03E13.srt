1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:05,710
<1-1,Howard>我们好像好久
<1-1,Howard>Seems like forever

2
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:08,190
<1-1,Howard>没有四个人一起出来吃饭了  我是说
<1-1,Howard>Since the four of us have been out to eat   you know?

3
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:09,240
<1-1,Howard>没有女生的情况下
<1-1,Howard>Just the guys.

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,020
<1-2,Raj>够了吧  我们知道了
<1-2,Raj>Oh   god! Yes   we get it.

5
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,530
<1-2,Raj>你现在有女朋友了
<1-2,Raj>You have a girlfriend now.

6
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,470
<1-3,Howard>搞得你小嫉妒了吗  真不好意思
<1-3,Howard>A little jealous   sorry?

7
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:17,290
<1-4,Raj>谁嫉妒了
<1-4,Raj>No   I'm not jealous.

8
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:22,300
<1-4,Raj>好吧  为了能嘿咻我愿意付出一切代价
<1-4,Raj>All right   I'd kill a hobo if it'll get me laid.

9
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,100
<1-4,Raj>可以点菜了吗
<1-4,Raj>Now   can we order?

10
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,870
<1-5,Sheldon>天啊  他们更新了菜单
<1-5,Sheldon>Oh   dear lord   they re-did the menu.

11
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:29,490
<1-6,Leonard>那又怎样  菜又没变
<1-6,Leonard>So what? It's the same food.

12
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,190
<1-7,Sheldon>是吗  看看这个
<1-7,Sheldon>Oh   is it? Look at this.

13
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:32,270
<1-7,Sheldon>左宗棠鸡[被归为湘菜]
<1-7,Sheldon>General tso's chicken

14
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:34,230
<1-7,Sheldon>它不是在招牌菜之列了
<1-7,Sheldon>Is no longer listed under "Specialties."

15
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:35,770
<1-7,Sheldon>而是归在鸡料理下面了
<1-7,Sheldon>It's now under "Chicken."

16
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:37,850
<1-8,Raj>所以呢[So与'Tso'同音]
<1-8,Raj>So?

17
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:39,390
<1-9,Sheldon>是的  是左宗棠鸡
<1-9,Sheldon>Yes   general tso.

18
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:44,530
<1-10,Raj>我不是说"左"  我是问"所以呢"
<1-10,Raj>Not "Tso  " The chicken   "So" The question.

19
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,610
<1-10,Raj>所以呢
<1-10,Raj>So?

20
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:49,260
<1-11,Sheldon>所以  它为什么不是招牌菜了呢
<1-11,Sheldon>So   why is it no longer a specialty?

21
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,060
<1-11,Sheldon>这里的厨师是对这道菜没了信心
<1-11,Sheldon>Did the chef lose confidence

22
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,770
<1-11,Sheldon>还是对他自己没了信心啊
<1-11,Sheldon>In the dish or himself?

23
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:55,010
<1-11,Sheldon>再看这里
<1-11,Sheldon>And look over here.

24
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:57,970
<1-11,Sheldon>强盗酱沾鲜虾
<1-11,Sheldon>"Shrimp in mobster sauce."

25
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,780
<1-11,Sheldon>强盗酱是什么
<1-11,Sheldon>What is "Mobster sauce"?

26
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,400
<1-12,Leonard>这明显是打印错误
<1-12,Leonard>It's obviously a typo.

27
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,250
<1-13,Sheldon>也许吧  也可能是这家餐馆现在是
<1-13,Sheldon>Perhaps. Or perhaps this restaurant's

28
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,330
<1-13,Sheldon>一场有组织的犯罪活动的前线阵地
<1-13,Sheldon>Now a front for organized crime.

29
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,560
<1-13,Sheldon>就上面的介绍来看  强盗酱里包含
<1-13,Sheldon>For all we know   the mobster sauce

30
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,310
<1-13,Sheldon>丰富的已死强盗的肉
<1-13,Sheldon>Contains actual chunks of deceased mobsters.

31
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:14,610
<1-14,Raj>不不不不  我觉得它的意思是
<1-14,Raj>No   no   no   no-- I think it just means

32
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,710
<1-14,Raj>这是一种强盗们喜欢的酱料
<1-14,Raj>It's the kind of sauce that mobsters like.

33
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,090
<1-15,Howard>没那么复杂啦
<1-15,Howard>It doesn't mean any of that!

34
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:20,210
<1-15,Howard>只是打印错误而已
<1-15,Howard>It's a typo.

35
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:21,490
<1-16,Leonard>这样吧  我们还是去吃批萨
<1-16,Leonard>You know what? Let's just get a pizza.

36
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:23,250
<1-17,Sheldon>好主意  我们去柯里昂意式餐厅
<1-17,Sheldon>Good idea. We'll go to corleone's.

37
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,910
<1-18,Howard>当然好  那儿可没有强盗
<1-18,Howard>Sure   no mobsters there.

38
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:31,020
<2-1,Sheldon>知道不  我越想越觉得
<2-1,Sheldon>You know   the more I think about it

39
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,480
<2-1,Sheldon>强盗酱里不可能包含
<2-1,Sheldon>the mobster sauce couldn't possibly contain

40
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,940
<2-1,Sheldon>丰富的强盗肉
<2-1,Sheldon>chunks of mobster.

41
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,250
<2-2,Leonard>这又是为什么呢
<2-2,Leonard>And why is that?

42
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,020
<2-3,Sheldon>它被归在海鲜里
<2-3,Sheldon>It was listed under "Seafood."

43
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,220
<2-4,Leonard>如果他们是一群跟鱼睡觉的强盗呢
<2-4,Leonard>What if they were mobsters who slept with the fishes?

44
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:52,650
<2-5,Sheldon>莱纳德  这可是很严肃的话题
<2-5,Sheldon>Leonard   are we having a serious conversation or not?

45
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,060
<2-6,Leonard (noticing their door has been broken open)>天啊...
<2-6,Leonard (noticing their door has been broken open)>What the...?

46
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,440
<2-7,Sheldon>电视机不见了

<2-8,Leonard>So are our laptops.

79
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,990

<3-7,Sheldon>You should be able to pull some good prints off this.

<3-8,Leonard>那我呢

90
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,470
<3-13,Policeman>我都问完了
<3-13,Policeman>We're done here.

91
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:05,880
<3-13,Policeman>打这个电话  我们会把调查报告传真给你们的
<3-13,Policeman>Call this number   and we'll fax you a copy of the report

92
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,990

<3-13,Policeman>So you can submit it to your insurance company.

93
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,130
<3-13,Policeman>请稍等
<3-13,Policeman>I-I'm sorry.

94
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,220
<3-14,Sheldon>你这就算问完了吗
<3-14,Sheldon>That's the end of your inquiry?

95
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,760
<3-15,Policeman>那你还有什么相关的信息要提供吗

96
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,830
<3-16,Sheldon>天呐  多得去了  比如说
<3-16,Sheldon>Oh   my goodness. Where do I begin? For instance--

97

<3-16,Sheldon>我笔记本电脑里
<3-16,Sheldon>My laptop contained

98

00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:23,360
<3-16,Sheldon>强有力的重述
<3-16,Sheldon>of the quantum measurement problem.

101
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,930
<3-17,Leonard>这对他们有何帮助
<3-17,Leonard>How is that going to help them?

102
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,180
<3-18,Sheldon>这样他们就可以监控科学出版社
<3-18,Sheldon>They could monitor scientific publications and see

103
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,550
<3-18,Sheldon>看看有没有其他人在未来的几个月内
<3-18,Sheldon>if anyone posts such a cogent restatement in the next

104
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:31,050
<3-18,Sheldon>寄给他们这类重述  如果有
<3-18,Sheldon>Couple of months. If so

105
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:31,990
<3-18,Sheldon>该作者就很有可能
<3-18,Sheldon>The authors are most likely

106
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,900
<3-18,Sheldon>偷了我的笔记本电脑

<3-20,Leonard>What are we supposed to do now?

110
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,640
<3-21,Sheldon>唯一能做的就是
<3-21,Sheldon>The only thing we can do.

111

<3-21,Sheldon>在罪犯回来前坐下看看手机电视

<3-21,Sheldon>在熟睡后被他棒打致死
<3-21,Sheldon>and bludgeon us to death in our sleep.

113
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,310
<3-22,Leonard>这是否意味着我排除嫌疑了
<3-22,Leonard>Does that mean you've ruled me out as a suspect?

114
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:05,090
<3-23,Sheldon>我多么希望不是你
<3-23,Sheldon>Oh   how I wish I could.

115
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,720
<4-1,Sheldon>我不必去尿尿
<4-1,Sheldon>I do not have to urinate.

116
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,470
<4-1,Sheldon>我的膀胱我做主
<4-1,Sheldon>I am the master of my own bladder.

117
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,700
<4-1,Sheldon>该死
<4-1,Sheldon>Drat.

118
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,180
<4-1,Sheldon>太难以置信了
<4-1,Sheldon>I can't believe it.

119
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,720
<4-1,Sheldon>要不是我一直在餐厅上班
<4-1,Sheldon>If I hadn't been working the dinner shift

120

<8-3,Leonard>What the hell are you doing out there?

242
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:13,550
<8-4,Sheldon>我听到有响声
<8-4,Sheldon>I heard a noise.

243
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:16,240
<8-5,Leonard>那是我们
<8-5,Leonard>It was us.

244
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,480
<8-5,Leonard>撞翻了一个台灯
<8-5,Leonard>We knocked over a lamp.

245
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,670
<8-6,Sheldon>你们干嘛要撞翻台灯
<8-6,Sheldon>Why would you knock over a lamp?

246

248
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:30,520
<8-9,Sheldon>没错  我是没必要知道你们在干嘛
<8-9,Sheldon>No   she's right   I don't need to know what you were doing.

249
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,120
<8-9,Sheldon>继续吧
<8-9,Sheldon>Carry on.

250

251
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,670
<8-10,Leonard>走门就可以了

<8-11,Sheldon>好主意
<8-11,Sheldon>Good thinking.

253
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,780
<8-11,Sheldon>或许我该四处查看下
<8-11,Sheldon>Perhaps I'll check the perimeter

254
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,540
<8-11,Sheldon>再泡点热牛奶
<8-11,Sheldon>and make some warm milk.

<8-13,Sheldon>Would you like me to bring you some warm milk?

00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:49,840
<8-14,Leonard>我有乳糖不耐症
<8-14,Leonard>I'm lactose intolerant.

258
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,280
<8-15,Sheldon>你是不想再弄出更大的声响来吓我
<8-15,Sheldon>And you don't wish to alarm me with any more loud noises.

259
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,800
<8-15,Sheldon>想得真周到
<8-15,Sheldon>Very thoughtful.

260

<8-15,Sheldon>佩妮  要热牛奶吗

266
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,150
<8-19,Penny>你又无能为力
<8-19,Penny>Ugh   what can you do?

267
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,250
<8-19,Penny>过来

<8-20,Leonard>Looks like Wolowitz got the net electrified.

271
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,390
<8-21,Penny>谢尔顿你没事吧
<8-21,Penny>Sheldon   are you okay?

272
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:33,490
<8-21,Penny>我  我没事
<8-21,Penny>I-I'm fine...

273
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:36,210
<8-22,Sheldon>只是控制不了自己的膀胱了
<8-22,Sheldon>Although I'm no longer the master of my own bladder.

274
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:44,290
<9-1,Sheldon>我的新电脑装了瘟骑系统
<9-1,Sheldon>My new computer came with windows 7.

275
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:49,310
<9-1,Sheldon>瘟骑比围死他更容易上手嘛
<9-1,Sheldon>Windows 7 is much more user-friendly than windows vista.

276
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,110
<9-1,Sheldon>这我可不喜欢
<9-1,Sheldon>I don't like that.

277
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,710
<9-2,Leonard>你不觉得搬到新城市去
<9-2,Leonard>Don't you think looking for a new city to live in

278
00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:00,070
<9-2,Leonard>有点反应过激了吗
<9-2,Leonard>is a bit of an overreaction?

279
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:01,930
<9-3,Sheldon>我们的公寓被盗
<9-3,Sheldon>Our apartment was broken into

280
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:04,170
<9-3,Sheldon>我们的保安系统又差点杀了我
<9-3,Sheldon>Our security system tried to kill me

281
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:06,740
<9-3,Sheldon>因此  我决定永久搬离帕萨迪纳
<9-3,Sheldon>And as a result   I'm leaving Pasadena forever.

282
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,890
<9-3,Sheldon>你说我这能叫反应过度吗
<9-3,Sheldon>Tell me how that's overreacting.

283
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,670
<9-4,Penny>拜托  谢尔顿  你可不能搬
<9-4,Penny>Come on   Sheldon   you can't move.

284
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:13,080
<9-4,Penny>你不是该留在原地吗
<9-4,Penny>Don't you need to stay in one place

285
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,340
<9-4,Penny>这样你的母舰返回时候
<9-4,Penny>so the mother ship can find you

286
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,840
<9-4,Penny>才能找到你
<9-4,Penny>when it returns?

287
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:19,850
<9-5,Sheldon>真是这样就好了
<9-5,Sheldon>Oh   if that were only true.

288
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,360
<9-5,Sheldon>不幸的是  在可预见的将来  我还得呆地球上
<9-5,Sheldon>Unfortunately   as I'm earthbound for the foreseeable future

289
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,910
<9-5,Sheldon>一定得找个比帕萨迪纳
<9-5,Sheldon>I need to find a location that's more hospitable

290
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:29,310
<9-5,Sheldon>更加友好安全的地方  比如
<9-5,Sheldon>than the mean streets of Pasadena   like...

294
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:38,110
<9-5,Sheldon>但没有火车模型店

295
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,040
<9-5,Sheldon>抱歉  伊尼德市
<9-5,Sheldon>Sorry   Enid.

296
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,160

<9-7,Leonard>不  他准备远程办公
<9-7,Leonard>Oh   no   he's going to telecommute.

304
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,860
<9-8,Sheldon>感觉这会吸引一帮不良分子过去
<9-8,Sheldon>Sounds like something that would attract the wrong crowd.

<10-6,Leonard>They call themselves "Bozites"?
