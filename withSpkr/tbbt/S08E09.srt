1
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:04,920
<1-1,Amy>这题很简单
<1-1,Amy>This is an easy one.

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,560
<1-1,Amy>你很喜欢他
<1-1,Amy>You love this guy.

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:07,830
<1-2,Sheldon>我自己
<1-2,Sheldon>Me.

5
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,890
<1-3,Amy>不是  他是个不够受人敬仰的天才
<1-3,Amy>Come on. He's an underappreciated genius.

6
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:14,880
<1-4,Sheldon>依然觉得是我自己
<1-4,Sheldon>Still think it's me.

7
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:16,920
<1-5,Amy>不是你
<1-5,Amy>It's not you.

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,600
<1-5,Amy>再想想  有车以他的名字命名
<1-5,Amy>Now think, there's a car named after him.

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,920
<1-6,Sheldon>当然有啦
<1-6,Sheldon>Of course there is.

11
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,460
<1-6,Sheldon>迷你"库伯"嘛  因为答案就是我
<1-6,Sheldon>The Mini Cooper 'cause it's me.

13
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:27,010
<1-7,Amy>我换个方式说
<1-7,Amy>How about this:

14
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:29,150
<1-7,Amy>他是降级版的谢尔顿·库伯
<1-7,Amy>he's a poor man's Sheldon Cooper.

15
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:30,700
<1-8,Sheldon>特斯拉
<1-8,Sheldon>Oh, Tesla.

16
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,600
<1-11,Sheldon>-如何了  -惨啊
<1-11,Sheldon>- How'd it go? - Oh, not fun.

17
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,260
<1-12,Leonard>医生把一个摄像头塞进了我的鼻窦
<1-12,Leonard>The doctor shoved a camera up into my sinuses.

18
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,130
<1-13,Penny>我看了
<1-13,Penny>Yeah, I watched.

19
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:42,200
<1-13,Penny>像《查理与巧克力工厂》里那段吓人的船游
<1-13,Penny>It was like the scary boat tunnel in Willy Wonka.

21
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:44,230
<1-14,Amy>-查出是什么问题了吗  -有啊
<1-14,Amy>- Did they figure out what's wrong? - Yeah.

22
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:45,870
<1-15,Leonard>是鼻中隔偏曲
<1-15,Leonard>It's a deviated septum.

24
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,260
<1-15,Leonard>手术矫正很简单
<1-15,Leonard>The surgery to correct it is simple.

25
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:48,440
<1-15,Leonard>医生下周给我做
<1-15,Leonard>He's gonna do it next week.

26
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,250
<1-16,Sheldon>你为什么要做手术
<1-16,Sheldon>Why would you have surgery?

27
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,970
<1-17,Leonard>因为我呼吸不顺
<1-17,Leonard>Because I can't breathe.

28
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:54,290
<1-17,Leonard>打呼  还会鼻窦发炎
<1-17,Leonard>I snore, I get sinus infections...

29
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:57,130
<1-18,Penny>滚开  这"抢手货"是我的
<1-18,Penny>Yeah, back off, he's all mine.

30
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:59,190
<1-19,Sheldon>但这又不是有生命危险的毛病
<1-19,Sheldon>But you don't have a life-threatening condition.

31
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:01,070
<1-19,Sheldon>你为什么要以身犯险做手术呢
<1-19,Sheldon>Why would you take the risk of surgery?

32
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:02,880
<1-20,Amy>谢尔顿  这只是常规手术
<1-20,Amy>Sheldon, it's a routine procedure.

33
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,890
<1-20,Amy>我也听你抱怨过他打呼很大声啊
<1-20,Amy>I've heard you complain about his snoring.

34
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,180
<1-21,Sheldon>是啊  同住的头5 6年是这样
<1-21,Sheldon>We... Yes, for the first five or six years,

35
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,230
<1-21,Sheldon>但我都已经慢慢习惯了
<1-21,Sheldon>but I've gotten used to it.

36
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:11,040
<1-21,Sheldon>而且还能助我入眠呢
<1-21,Sheldon>It helps me sleep.

37
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,930
<1-21,Sheldon>他就像我的鼻黏液动力助眠仪
<1-21,Sheldon>He's like my mucus-powered white noise machine.

38
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,240
<1-22,Leonard>谢尔顿  我要做这个手术  不用大惊小怪
<1-22,Leonard>Sheldon, I'm gonna get the surgery, it's no big deal.

39
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,150
<1-22,Leonard>不必多说了
<1-22,Leonard>End of story.

40
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:20,030
<1-23,Sheldon>行  那我也不多说了
<1-23,Sheldon>Very well. I'm done talking about it.

41
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:20,620
<1-24,Leonard>谢谢
<1-24,Leonard>Thank you.

42
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:22,180
<1-25,Sheldon>我记得现在是轮到你猜了吧
<1-25,Sheldon>I believe it was your turn in the game.

43
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:23,260
<1-26,Amy>好的
<1-26,Amy>Okay.

44
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:26,210
<1-26,Amy>我想想
<1-26,Amy>Let's see...

46
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:28,820
<1-27,Sheldon>这个人最出名的就是
<1-27,Sheldon>Oh, this person is most famous

47
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:32,840
<1-27,Sheldon>绝不会让鼻子接受非必要手术的残害
<1-27,Sheldon>for never having gotten his nose mutilated with elective surgery

48
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:35,690
<1-27,Sheldon>更不会让自己下半辈子活在
<1-27,Sheldon>and never living the rest of his life in the shadows

49
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:38,370
<1-27,Sheldon>丑陋畸形的妖怪阴影之下
<1-27,Sheldon>as a hideous, disfigured freak.

50
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:40,830
<1-28,Leonard>你觉得你能给出更好的提示
<1-28,Leonard>I think you could give a better clue.

51
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:41,920
<1-28,Leonard>给不出啊
<1-28,Leonard>I don't.

52
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:45,050
<1-29,Sheldon>我都不知道那是人名  还是打错字
<1-29,Sheldon>I'm not even sure if that's a person or a typo.

59
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,790
<2-1,Leonard>能告诉我为什么吗
<2-1,Leonard>Okay, why?

60
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:30,750
<2-2,Sheldon>我来听你打呼啊
<2-2,Sheldon>I'm listening to you snore.

61
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,820
<2-2,Sheldon>我在想日后听不见了  该如何入眠
<2-2,Sheldon>I'm wondering how I'll ever sleep without it.

62
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,260
<2-3,Leonard>如果能助你入眠
<2-3,Leonard>If it helps you sleep,

63
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,310
<2-3,Leonard>那你为什么还坐在这里盯着我
<2-3,Leonard>then why are you sitting here staring at me

64
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:41,500
<2-3,Leonard>像个白化症版的夜魔鬼
<2-3,Leonard>like the albino boogeyman?

65
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,880
<2-4,Sheldon>莱纳德  羞辱我你忍心吗
<2-4,Sheldon>Really, Leonard-- insults?

66
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,560
<2-4,Sheldon>为了等你睡着  我可是在你衣柜里
<2-4,Sheldon>After I spent two hours in your closet,

67
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,670
<2-4,Sheldon>蹲点了两个小时呢
<2-4,Sheldon>waiting for you to fall asleep?

68
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:51,880
<2-5,Leonard>你是在闹哪样
<2-5,Leonard>What's your problem?

69
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,510
<2-6,Sheldon>如果手术成功了  打呼会消失
<2-6,Sheldon>If the surgery is successful, the snoring is gone.

70
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:58,270
<2-6,Sheldon>但如果你手术台上死了
<2-6,Sheldon>And if you die during surgery...

71
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,330
<2-6,Sheldon>打呼也会消失
<2-6,Sheldon>...the snoring is gone.

72
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:05,790
<2-7,Leonard>所以无论如何  你都不会来烦我了
<2-7,Leonard>It sounds like either way, I finally get some rest.

73
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:07,720
<2-8,Sheldon>莱纳德  我实话告诉你
<2-8,Sheldon>I have to be honest with you Leonard,

74
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,470
<2-8,Sheldon>我真的很担心
<2-8,Sheldon>I'm truly worried.

75
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:12,180
<2-9,Leonard>我跟你说了  没什么好担心的
<2-9,Leonard>I-I told you, there's nothing to worry about.

76
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,880
<2-10,Sheldon>我去查了些资料
<2-10,Sheldon>Well, I've been doing some research

77
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,470
<2-10,Sheldon>每70万做全身麻醉的人中
<2-10,Sheldon>and I've learned that one in 700,000 people

78
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,980
<2-10,Sheldon>就有1人死亡呢
<2-10,Sheldon>die from general anesthesia.

79
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:21,330
<2-11,Leonard>兄弟  那你知道这就代表有另外
<2-11,Leonard>Buddy, w... Do you realize that that also means

80
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:26,390
<2-11,Leonard>69万9千9百99人没死吗
<2-11,Leonard>699,999 people don't die?

81
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,580
<2-12,Sheldon>你说得也没错
<2-12,Sheldon>I suppose that's true.

82
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:34,100
<2-12,Sheldon>你真是个乐观的人啊
<2-12,Sheldon>You're such a glass half-full kind of guy.

83
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,220
<2-12,Sheldon>我会缅怀你的乐观
<2-12,Sheldon>I'm going to miss that.

84
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:43,300
<3-1,Raj>我爸妈的结婚40周年纪念日快到了
<3-1,Raj>Oh, so, my, uh, parents' 40th anniversary's coming up

85
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,850
<3-1,Raj>我想不出该送他们什么
<3-1,Raj>and I can't think of a thing to get them.

86
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,170
<3-2,Howard>靠  你能想象
<3-2,Howard>Damn, can you imagine

87
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:50,720
<3-2,Howard>跟一个人结婚40年之久吗
<3-2,Howard>being married to someone for 40 years?

88
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,580
<3-3,Bernadette>想象不到了
<3-3,Bernadette>Not anymore.

89
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,430
<3-4,Raj>所以  有什么礼物推荐吗
<3-4,Raj>Anyway, any ideas on a gift?

90
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,540
<3-5,Bernadette>他们平常喜欢些什么呢
<3-5,Bernadette>Well, what are some of the things they like?

91
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:07,130
<3-6,Raj>他们以前喜欢去听孟买爱乐交响乐团
<3-6,Raj>They used to like going to the Mumbai Symphony,

92
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:09,360
<3-6,Raj>去年时  我妈觉得他们只是在草草了事
<3-6,Raj>but last year my mom thought they were phoning it in.

93
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,620
<3-6,Raj>我爸说从性生活来看
<3-6,Raj>Then my dad said based on their love life,

94
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,620
<3-6,Raj>我妈的确是很懂"操操了事"
<3-6,Raj>she should know about phoning it in.

95
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,910
<3-7,Bernadette>-你爸这么跟你妈说话啊  -当时他俩在冷战
<3-7,Bernadette>- He said that to her? - Well, they weren't speaking at the time,

96
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:19,230
<3-8,Raj>所以他让下人去跟她说的
<3-8,Raj>so he had a servant say it to her.

97
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:22,020
<3-8,Raj>或许我能给他俩亲手做个礼物
<3-8,Raj>Oh, maybe I could make a gift for them.

98
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:25,980
<3-8,Raj>我知道你们俩非常喜欢我给你们做的杯垫
<3-8,Raj>I know how much you guys love the coasters I made for you.

99
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,570
<3-9,Bernadette>如果离婚了  杯垫归你
<3-9,Bernadette>They're yours in the divorce.

100
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,610
<4-1,Leonard>在研究什么呢
<4-1,Leonard>Hey. What're you working on?

101
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,290
<4-2,Sheldon>还记得我跟你说  如果你去做手术
<4-2,Sheldon>Remember when I said if you went through with your surgery,

102
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:42,210
<4-2,Sheldon>你有70万分之1的几率死亡吗
<4-2,Sheldon>there was a one-in-700,000 chance of dying?

103
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:44,020
<4-3,Leonard>然后呢
<4-3,Leonard>Yeah...?

104
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,170
<4-4,Sheldon>我研究了数据
<4-4,Sheldon>Well, I've been crunching the numbers,

105
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:49,240
<4-4,Sheldon>目前我已经把你做手术的死亡率
<4-4,Sheldon>and so far, I've gotten your probability of death

106
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,420
<4-4,Sheldon>提高到了让菊花一紧的300分之1了
<4-4,Sheldon>all the way to a sphincter-tightening one in 300.

107
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:56,540
<4-5,Leonard>说得真是时候
<4-5,Leonard>Great timing.

108
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:59,230
<4-5,Leonard>我的"检查菊花"灯刚好亮了呢
<4-5,Leonard>My "Check sphincter" light just went on.

109
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:02,570
<4-6,Sheldon>莱纳德  要是你对外科医生的
<4-6,Sheldon>Leonard, what if you have an allergic reaction

110
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:04,110
<4-6,Sheldon>乳胶手套产生过敏反应怎么办
<4-6,Sheldon>to the surgeon's latex gloves?

111
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,800
<4-7,Leonard>我对乳胶不过敏
<4-7,Leonard>I'm not allergic to latex.

112
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,220
<4-8,Sheldon>那你为什么不戴我给你买的
<4-8,Sheldon>Well, then why don't you wear the rubber gloves

113
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,770
<4-8,Sheldon>洗碗用橡胶手套
<4-8,Sheldon>I bought for you to do the dishes?

114
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:12,110
<4-9,Leonard>跟我不穿围裙不戴发网的理由一样
<4-9,Leonard>For the same reason I don't wear the apron or the hair net.

115
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,300
<4-10,Sheldon>好吧  那癫痫呢
<4-10,Sheldon>Fine. What about epilepsy?

116
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,930
<4-11,Leonard>我也没有癫痫
<4-11,Leonard>I don't have epilepsy, either.

117
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:19,050
<4-12,Sheldon>你是没有  但手术医生可能有啊
<4-12,Sheldon>You don't, but the surgeon might, hmm?

118
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:23,080
<4-12,Sheldon>只有手术刀稍微拿不稳  你的颈动脉
<4-12,Sheldon>And your carotid artery is just one shaky scalpel away

119
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,850
<4-12,Sheldon>就立刻变成迪士尼的跳舞喷泉
<4-12,Sheldon>from becoming the dancing fountain at Disneyland.

120
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,890
<4-13,Leonard>谢尔顿  你知道开车比做手术更危险吗
<4-13,Leonard>Sheldon, do you realize that driving is riskier than surgery?

121
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:33,070
<4-14,Sheldon>我知道  开车去医院的命丧几率在这呢
<4-14,Sheldon>I do. I have the drive to the hospital right here.

122
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:34,970
<4-14,Sheldon>前提是你能顺利上车
<4-14,Sheldon>That is if you make it to the car

123
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:37,200
<4-14,Sheldon>没有掉下楼梯摔死
<4-14,Sheldon>without falling down the stairs.

124
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,430
<4-14,Sheldon>别指望我背[罩]你  我平常够罩着你了
<4-14,Sheldon>And don't expect me to carry you, I do that enough in life.

125
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,340
<4-15,Leonard>伙计  我知道你是担心我
<4-15,Leonard>Buddy, I-I get that you're worried about me

126
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:46,060
<4-15,Leonard>我很谢谢你的好意  但我不会死的
<4-15,Leonard>and I-I appreciate that, but I'm not going to die.

127
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,760
<4-16,Sheldon>你又不知道
<4-16,Sheldon>You don't know that.

128
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:51,340
<4-17,Leonard>我肯定知道我不会死于小行星撞地球
<4-17,Leonard>I do know that it won't be from an asteroid strike.

129
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:54,190
<4-18,Sheldon>你知道谁还这么说过吗
<4-18,Sheldon>You know who else said that?

130
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,600
<4-18,Sheldon>每头自认天下无敌的霸王龙
<4-18,Sheldon>Every cocky T. Rex currently

131
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,560
<4-18,Sheldon>早化成石油在你汽车油箱里游泳呢
<4-18,Sheldon>swimming around in the gas tank of your car.

132
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,810
<4-19,Leonard>如果真有小行星撞地球
<4-19,Leonard>I-If there was an asteroid strike,

133
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:02,150
<4-19,Leonard>那你不也会死吗
<4-19,Leonard>wouldn't you die, too?

134
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,760
<4-20,Sheldon>那可不好说  我又聪明生命力又强
<4-20,Sheldon>I don't know-- I'm smart and scrappy,

135
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,760
<4-20,Sheldon>我觉得我会活下去
<4-20,Sheldon>I think I'd find a way.

136
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,350
<4-21,Leonard>这样吧  离手术还有一周时间
<4-21,Leonard>Tell you what-- the surgery's not for a week,

137
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,260
<4-21,Leonard>我再好好考虑一下
<4-21,Leonard>I'll think about it.

138
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,690
<4-21,Leonard>谢谢
<4-21,Leonard>Thank you.

139
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:14,120
<4-22,Sheldon>你考虑的时候不妨想想
<4-22,Sheldon>And while you're thinking about it,

140
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,060
<4-22,Sheldon>如果你暴雨季节在尼加拉瓜做手术
<4-22,Sheldon>if you have the surgery in Nicaragua during monsoon season,

141
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,650
<4-22,Sheldon>我可以打包票  你必死无疑
<4-22,Sheldon>I can practically guarantee your death.

142
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,680
<5-1,Raj (on phone)>是  好的
<5-1,Raj (on phone)>Yes. Okay.

143
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,980
<5-1,Raj (on phone)>我明白
<5-1,Raj (on phone)>I-I understand.

144
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,120
<5-1,Raj (on phone)>当然  是的
<5-1,Raj (on phone)>Of course, yes.

145
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,320
<5-1,Raj (on phone)>我明天打给你
<5-1,Raj (on phone)>I'll call you tomorrow.

146
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:32,810
<5-1,Raj (on phone)>再见
<5-1,Raj (on phone)>Bye.

147
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:37,240
<5-2,Howard>我发现伯班克市有一个击剑学校
<5-2,Howard>So I found this fencing school in Burbank

148
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,240
<5-2,Howard>开有绝地武士教学班
<5-2,Howard>that has a Jedi class.

149
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,200
<5-2,Howard>如果你不介意是那个班里唯一的大人
<5-2,Howard>And if you're cool being the only adults there,

150
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,950
<5-2,Howard>那他们很乐意接收你
<5-2,Howard>they said they are.

151
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:48,200
<5-3,Raj>兄弟  我的父母刚离婚了
<5-3,Raj>Dude, my parents just split up.

152
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,090
<5-4,Howard>什么
<5-4,Howard>What?!

153
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:50,990
<5-5,Raj>刚才是我爸的电话
<5-5,Raj>Uh, that was my dad on the phone.

154
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,670
<5-5,Raj>他搬出去了
<5-5,Raj>He moved out.

155
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:56,580
<5-6,Howard>天啊  我很遗憾
<5-6,Howard>Oh, my God, I... I'm sorry.

156
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,720
<5-6,Howard>如果你不想去  我们可以不出去
<5-6,Howard>I mean, if you're not up to it, we don't have to go out,

157
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,150
<5-6,Howard>待在家里也行
<5-6,Howard>we can just hang here.

158
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:01,510
<5-6,Howard>没关系
<5-6,Howard>No, it's fine.

159
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:02,940
<5-7,Raj>没什么大不了的
<5-7,Raj>It's not that big a deal.

160
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,100
<5-7,Raj>只要他们开心  我就开心
<5-7,Raj>As long as they're happy, I'm happy.

161
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,540
<5-7,Raj>等我节假日回去看他们时
<5-7,Raj>And when I get to see them for the holidays,

162
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,490
<5-7,Raj>我得过两次印度排灯节
<5-7,Raj>I'll get to celebrate Diwali twice--

164
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:11,480
<5-7,Raj>一人家里过一次
<5-7,Raj>one at each house.

165
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:15,700
<5-7,Raj>那就变成了"双"排灯节
<5-7,Raj>That's double the Diwali.

166
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:18,100
<5-8,Howard>你确定没事吗
<5-8,Howard>You sure you're okay?

167
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:18,860
<5-9,Raj>没事
<5-9,Raj>I'm okay.

168
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:19,860
<5-10,Howard>你看起来可不像哦
<5-10,Howard>You don't look okay.

169
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:23,270
<5-11,Raj>怎么可能会没事  我是一个家庭破碎的小孩
<5-11,Raj>How can I be okay? I come from a broken home.

170
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:28,270
<6-1,Leonard>医生说10点我手术就做完了
<6-1,Leonard>The doctor said I should be out of surgery by 10:00.

171
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,440
<6-1,Leonard>好的
<6-1,Leonard>Okay.

172
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,080
<6-2,Penny>谢尔顿真的会相信
<6-2,Penny>And Sheldon really believes

173
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,240
<6-2,Penny>我们去公共泳池游泳了吗
<6-2,Penny>we're at a public swimming pool?

174
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,320
<6-3,Leonard>他肯定会忙着算
<6-3,Leonard>He was so busy figuring out

175
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,520
<6-3,Leonard>我们泡在含百万分之多少的尿液里
<6-3,Leonard>how many parts per million of urine we'd be floating around in,

176
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,630
<6-3,Leonard>没空起疑心
<6-3,Leonard>he didn't even question it.

177
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:44,260
<6-3,Leonard>百万分之18
<6-3,Leonard>18 parts per million.

178
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,870
<7-1,Sheldon>他仍执意要去
<7-1,Sheldon>And he's still doing it.

179
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:50,600
<7-2,Amy>别管他们啦  我很开心能载你去上班
<7-2,Amy>Don't worry about that. I'm happy to take you to work.

180
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,860
<7-2,Amy>谢谢你
<7-2,Amy>Well, thank you.

181
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:55,770
<7-3,Sheldon>莱纳德从来不准我在车里吃法式吐司条
<7-3,Sheldon>And Leonard never lets me have French toast sticks in the car.

182
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,910
<7-3,Sheldon>我不能有沾上糖浆的手指
<7-3,Sheldon>I can't have syrupy fingers,

183
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:01,120
<7-3,Sheldon>但他却能在马桶里仰泳
<7-3,Sheldon>but he can do the backstroke in a toilet bowl.

184
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,940
<7-4,Amy>他们锻炼身体也是好事啊
<7-4,Amy>It's nice they're getting exercise.

185
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:07,900
<7-5,Sheldon>现在仔细想想
<7-5,Sheldon>Although now that I think about it,

186
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,820
<7-5,Sheldon>莱纳德去公共场合游泳时
<7-5,Sheldon>Leonard would never go swimming in public

187
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:12,280
<7-5,Sheldon>一定会穿上他的游泳衣
<7-5,Sheldon>without his swim shirt.

188
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,940
<7-6,Amy>他肯定带了
<7-6,Amy>I'm sure he brought it.

189
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:17,040
<7-7,Sheldon>不可能  去年在魔术山游乐场
<7-7,Sheldon>No, but last year, at Magic Mountain,

190
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,440
<7-7,Sheldon>他严重晒伤
<7-7,Sheldon>he got such a bad sunburn,

191
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,960
<7-7,Sheldon>得把泳衣剪掉才能脱下来
<7-7,Sheldon>we had to cut him out of it.

192
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,550
<7-8,Amy>他可能买了新的  快吃你的早餐
<7-8,Amy>He probably got a new one. Finish your breakfast.

193
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:26,350
<7-8,Amy>瞧  我仪表板上有一整块区域
<7-8,Amy>Look, there's an entire section of my dashboard

194
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:28,400
<7-8,Amy>没有糖浆哦  快去乱沾
<7-8,Amy>that doesn't have any syrup on it.

195
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:32,500
<7-9,Sheldon>你举止好奇怪  怎么了
<7-9,Sheldon>You're acting odd. Why?

196
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,450
<7-10,Amy>我向来举止古怪  每个人都知道
<7-10,Amy>I'm odd all the time, everyone knows that.

197
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:37,660
<7-10,Amy>昨晚我还往自己嘴里塞蚕豆
<7-10,Amy>Just last night, I tried to see how many fava beans

198
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,860
<7-10,Amy>试试到底能塞多少颗呢
<7-10,Amy>I could fit in my mouth.

199
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:42,370
<7-11,Sheldon>告诉我实话
<7-11,Sheldon>Tell me the truth.

200
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:43,830
<7-11,Sheldon>28颗
<7-11,Sheldon>28.

201
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,270
<7-14,Amy>-老实点  -其实是56颗啦
<7-14,Amy>- Come on. - Fifty-six.

202
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:49,000
<7-15,Sheldon>艾米
<7-15,Sheldon>Amy!

203
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,090
<7-15,Sheldon>到底怎么回事
<7-15,Sheldon>What's going on?

204
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:52,390
<7-15,Sheldon>好吧
<7-15,Sheldon>All right.

205
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:55,210
<7-16,Amy>别生气哦
<7-16,Amy>Don't get upset, but...

206
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,840
<7-16,Amy>莱纳德得到一个提前做手术的机会
<7-16,Amy>an earlier appointment opened up for Leonard

207
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,280
<7-16,Amy>现在他应该在手术中了吧
<7-16,Amy>and he's getting the surgery right now.

208
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,640
<7-17,Sheldon>我明白了
<7-17,Sheldon>I see.

209
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:13,960
<7-17,Sheldon>载我去找莱纳德
<7-17,Sheldon>Take me to Leonard.

210
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,910
<7-18,Amy>你就乖乖上班吧  他会没事的
<7-18,Amy>Just go to work, he'll be fine.

211
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:17,810
<7-19,Sheldon>艾米  他是我最好的朋友
<7-19,Sheldon>Amy, he's my best friend,

212
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:20,630
<7-19,Sheldon>就算你不载我去  我也一定会去
<7-19,Sheldon>and if you don't take me, I'm going there anyway.

213
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:22,520
<7-19,Sheldon>好吧
<7-19,Sheldon>Fine.

214
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:25,900
<7-20,Amy>你真是位好朋友  这么关心他
<7-20,Amy>It's sweet that you care about him so much.

215
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:26,920
<4-17,Leonard>没错
<4-17,Leonard>I do.

216
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:28,820
<7-21,Sheldon>万一他有什么不测
<7-21,Sheldon>And I wouldn't be able to forgive myself,

217
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,190
<7-21,Sheldon>我一定无法原谅自己
<7-21,Sheldon>if something happened to him

218
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:33,810
<7-21,Sheldon>不能在他床边跟他说  "我就说吧"
<7-21,Sheldon>and I wasn't at his bedside to say, "I told you so."

219
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:47,940
<8-1,Sheldon>你好啊
<8-1,Sheldon>Hello.

220
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,360
<8-2,Penny>我们游得很开心哦
<8-2,Penny>We had a really nice swim.

221
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,570
<8-3,Sheldon>省省吧
<8-3,Sheldon>Oh, stop it.

222
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:54,290
<8-3,Sheldon>我猜医疗中心肯定治好
<8-3,Sheldon>I assume this medical center's already treated

223
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:58,490
<8-3,Sheldon>你今天裤子着火屁股被烧伤的地方了吧
<8-3,Sheldon>the burns on your bottom from the recent pants fire.

225
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:00,990
<8-4,Penny>因为我是骗子吗
<8-4,Penny>'Cause I'm a liar, liar?

226
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:03,270
<8-5,Sheldon>这得由消防队长来判定
<8-5,Sheldon>That's for the fire marshal to determine.

227
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:05,860
<8-6,Penny>你非得告诉他吗
<8-6,Penny>You had to tell him?

228
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,670
<8-7,Amy>他死缠烂打
<8-7,Amy>He wore me down.

229
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:08,820
<8-7,Amy>再加上我意乱情迷
<8-7,Amy>And I was distracted.

230
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,540
<8-7,Amy>他今天用了比较多婴儿爽身粉
<8-7,Amy>He has on extra baby powder today.

231
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:13,820
<8-8,Sheldon>他没事吧
<8-8,Sheldon>Is he okay?

232
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,320
<8-9,Penny>还在做手术
<8-9,Penny>He's still in surgery.

233
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:17,960
<8-10,Sheldon>很好
<8-10,Sheldon>Very well.

234
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,220
<8-11,Penny>他会没事的
<8-11,Penny>He's gonna be all right.

235
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,620
<8-11,Penny>怎么黏糊糊的
<8-11,Penny>That is sticky.

236
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:27,740
<8-12,Amy>好了  我们聊点手术以外的事情吧
<8-12,Amy>Come on, let's talk about something other than the surgery.

237
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,100
<8-13,Sheldon>好主意
<8-13,Sheldon>That's a good idea.

238
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:33,900
<8-13,Sheldon>佩妮  你和莱纳德讨论过葬礼的安排吗
<8-13,Sheldon>Penny, did you and Leonard ever discuss funeral arrangements?

239
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:38,170
<8-14,Penny>她是说聊点开心的事情
<8-14,Penny>I think she meant something a little happier.

240
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:41,860
<8-15,Sheldon>我们是可以当成喜事庆祝一番
<8-15,Sheldon>I suppose we could try to make it a celebration,

241
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:44,250
<8-15,Sheldon>可他是英年早逝
<8-15,Sheldon>but he died so young.

242
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,500
<9-1,Howard>-有人吗  -好啊
<9-1,Howard>- Knock, knock. Hi. - Hey.

243
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,110
<9-3,Raj>你们怎么来了
<9-3,Raj>What brings you by?

244
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:55,260
<9-4,Bernadette>松饼[没什么]的事儿
<9-4,Bernadette>muffin much.

245
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,540
<9-5,Howard>告诉过你了  不好笑
<9-5,Howard>Told you-- not funny.

246
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,410
<9-6,Bernadette>他不笑
<9-6,Bernadette>He's just not laughing

247
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:04,780
<9-6,Bernadette>是因为他感觉"难"莓
<9-6,Bernadette>because he's feeling... blue berry.

248
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,620
<9-6,Bernadette>好难取悦
<9-6,Bernadette>Tough crowd.

249
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:12,480
<9-7,Raj>抱歉  你们真好  谢谢
<9-7,Raj>I'm sorry. This is very sweet. Thanks.

250
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,710
<9-8,Howard>你怎么样了
<9-8,Howard>So, how you doing?

251
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,410
<9-9,Raj>现在没事了  这件事情
<9-9,Raj>Better. I guess the news just

252
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:17,480
<9-9,Raj>比我想象中给我的打击更大
<9-9,Raj>hit me a lot harder than I expected.

253
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,570
<9-10,Bernadette>当然
<9-10,Bernadette>Well, of course.

254
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:21,350
<9-10,Bernadette>如果我的父母分手了  我肯定会崩溃
<9-10,Bernadette>I would be devastated if my parents split up.

255
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:24,430
<9-11,Howard>为什么  你父亲几乎不和你母亲说话
<9-11,Howard>Why? Your father barely speaks to your mother.

256
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:25,880
<9-12,Bernadette>至少他还在我们身边
<9-12,Bernadette>Well, at least he stuck around,

257
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,270
<9-12,Bernadette>不像你父亲  一走了之
<9-12,Bernadette>not like your dad, who just took off.

258
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:31,010
<9-13,Howard>如你所见  我们是来逗你开心的
<9-13,Howard>As you can see, we're here to cheer you up.

259
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,530
<9-14,Bernadette>抱歉  拉杰
<9-14,Bernadette>Sorry, Raj.

260
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:36,050
<9-14,Bernadette>你知道你爸妈是怎么回事吗
<9-14,Bernadette>Do you have any sense of what happened with your folks?

261
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:39,420
<9-15,Raj>日子一天天过去  他们开始互相怨恨
<9-15,Raj>I think, over time, they started to resent each other,

262
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,640
<9-15,Raj>他们没有好好解决两人之间的矛盾
<9-15,Raj>and instead of talking about the things that bothered them,

263
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,990
<9-15,Raj>反而将其压在心底
<9-15,Raj>they kept it bottled up,

264
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:44,960
<9-15,Raj>怨恨日渐加深
<9-15,Raj>and the hate just grew.

265
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,750
<9-16,Bernadette>他们在一起的日子一直不开心  真是太可怜了
<9-16,Bernadette>It's a shame they spent all that time unhappy.

266
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,810
<9-16,Bernadette>不过有时候
<9-16,Bernadette>But sometimes,

267
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:52,750
<9-16,Bernadette>你也无能为"松饼"[力]
<9-16,Bernadette>there's muffin you can do about it.

268
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:56,990
<9-16,Bernadette>你懂的  对吧
<9-16,Bernadette>You get it, right?

269
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,430
<10-1,Penny>你真好  还给他带了礼物
<10-1,Penny>Oh, it's nice you got him that.

270
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,380
<10-2,Sheldon>这不是给莱纳德的
<10-2,Sheldon>Oh, this isn't for Leonard, no.

271
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,480
<10-2,Sheldon>这是艾米买给我的
<10-2,Sheldon>Amy bought it for me.

272
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,990
<10-3,Amy>进来的时候  他的脚趾头踢到了旋转门
<10-3,Amy>Stubbed his toe on the revolving door on the way in.

273
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:14,740
<10-4,Sheldon>你知道那些转来转去的事物会让我头晕
<10-4,Sheldon>You know those confounded things make me dizzy.

274
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:17,640
<10-5,Amy>谁让你一直跟着门转
<10-5,Amy>Who told you to keep going around?

275
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,720
<10-6,Sheldon>大厅里有一株很大的植物
<10-6,Sheldon>There was a large plant in the lobby.

276
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,220
<10-6,Sheldon>老让我觉得那是外边
<10-6,Sheldon>It kept looking like the outside.

277
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:24,580
<10-7,Penny>听我说  莱纳德出来的时候
<10-7,Penny>Okay, listen, when Leonard comes out,

278
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,550
<10-7,Penny>他肯定会不太好受
<10-7,Penny>he is not gonna feel great,

279
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:27,640
<10-7,Penny>所以请别让他更难受
<10-7,Penny>so, please don't give him a hard time.

280
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,280
<10-8,Amy>佩妮说得对
<10-8,Amy>Penny has a good point.

281
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,280
<10-8,Amy>他就像在超市里遇到的那个
<10-8,Amy>This is like the man in the supermarket

282
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,830
<10-8,Amy>脖子上有甲状腺肿的人
<10-8,Amy>with the goiter on his neck.

283
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:35,850
<10-8,Amy>不管你心里怎么想  不要说出来
<10-8,Amy>Whatever you're thinking, just keep it to yourself.

284
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,150
<10-9,Sheldon>肿得像个葡萄柚
<10-9,Sheldon>It was like a grapefruit.

285
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,250
<10-10,Amy>人家自己心里知道
<10-10,Amy>And I'm sure he knew that

286
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:44,290
<10-10,Amy>不需要你拿个葡萄柚去他脖子旁比较
<10-10,Amy>before you held a grapefruit up next to it.

287
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:46,660
<10-11,Sheldon>我可不敢保证什么
<10-11,Sheldon>Well, I'm not making any promises.

288
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:49,460
<10-11,Sheldon>莱纳德不仅做了我认为无用的危险之事
<10-11,Sheldon>Not only did Leonard take what I feel is an unnecessary risk,

289
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,550
<10-11,Sheldon>他还欺骗了我
<10-11,Sheldon>he deceived me.

290
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:51,780
<10-12,Penny>他欺骗你
<10-12,Penny>Okay, the reason he deceived you is

291
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,420
<10-12,Penny>是因为你让人蛋疼
<10-12,Penny>you were being a pain in the ass.

292
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,570
<10-13,Sheldon>我会这么烦人是因为
<10-13,Sheldon>The reason I was being a pain in the B is

293
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:57,870
<10-13,Sheldon>我担心他  而你们都不担心
<10-13,Sheldon>because I was worried about him, and no one else was.

294
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:59,610
<10-14,Penny>不是吧  "蛋"疼你都说不出口
<10-14,Penny>Really? You won't even say "A"?

295
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:01,930
<10-15,Sheldon>打死我都不说这词
<10-15,Sheldon>You bet your sweet B I won't.

296
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:04,090
<10-16,Penny>我当然关心莱纳德
<10-16,Penny>Obviously, I care about Leonard.

297
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:05,920
<10-16,Penny>我会和他一起度过余生呢
<10-16,Penny>I'm gonna spend the rest of my life with him.

298
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,010
<10-16,Penny>我就不会吗
<10-16,Penny>And I'm not?

299
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:12,380
<10-17,Sheldon>是地震
<10-17,Sheldon>It's an earthquake.

300
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,650
<10-17,Sheldon>我就知道
<10-17,Sheldon>I knew it.

301
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:15,290
<10-18,Penny>谢尔顿  只是小小的震动
<10-18,Penny>Sheldon, it was just a little tremor.

302
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:18,050
<10-19,Sheldon>小小的震动就会把简单的鼻窦手术
<10-19,Sheldon>A little tremor that turns routine sinus surgery

303
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:20,290
<10-19,Sheldon>变成危险的额叶切除手术
<10-19,Sheldon>into a frontal lobotomy.

304
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,920
<10-19,Sheldon>我才不管什么地震呢
<10-19,Sheldon>Oh, I don't care for this at all.

305
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,020
<10-19,Sheldon>我要去看看他怎么样了
<10-19,Sheldon>Oh, I need to see he's okay.

306
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,900
<10-20,Amy>谢尔顿  你不能进去
<10-20,Amy>Sheldon, you can't go back there.

307
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,400
<10-21,Sheldon>来啊  阻止我
<10-21,Sheldon>Try and stop me!

308
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,550
<10-22,Amy>你没事吧
<10-22,Amy>Are you okay?

309
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:38,060
<10-23,Sheldon>为什么不阻止我
<10-23,Sheldon>Why didn't you stop me?!

310
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,630
<11-1,Bernadette>我跟你说点事
<11-1,Bernadette>Can I tell you something?

311
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,880
<11-1,Bernadette>拉杰父母的事情
<11-1,Bernadette>This whole thing with Raj's parents

312
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,420
<11-1,Bernadette>让我有点担心我们
<11-1,Bernadette>just got me a little worried about us.

313
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,880
<11-2,Howard>你说什么呢  我们很好啊
<11-2,Howard>What are you talking about? We're fine.

314
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:53,360
<11-2,Howard>拉杰父母会分手有可能是因为拉杰
<11-2,Howard>And Raj's parents probably split up because of Raj.

315
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,650
<5-4,Howard>什么
<5-4,Howard>What?!

316
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:58,580
<11-3,Bernadette>人们总说不该怪孩子  但是...
<11-3,Bernadette>They always say the children aren't to blame, but...

317
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:00,430
<11-4,Howard>这人啊
<11-4,Howard>Come on.

318
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:05,860
<11-5,Bernadette>我不是开玩笑  华仔
<11-5,Bernadette>I'm not joking, Howie.

319
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,430
<11-5,Bernadette>你也听到了他说的他父母的事情
<11-5,Bernadette>You heard what he said about his parents.

320
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,860
<11-5,Bernadette>都是些小事  积压久了便爆发
<11-5,Bernadette>It was the little things they kept bottled up.

321
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:12,090
<11-5,Bernadette>我可不想我们变成那样
<11-5,Bernadette>I don't want that to happen to us.

322
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:14,120
<11-6,Howard>你怎么才肯相信我们不会
<11-6,Howard>How can I convince you it won't?

323
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,700
<11-7,Bernadette>你对我有什么意见没有说出来的吗
<11-7,Bernadette>Well, is there anything about me you're keeping inside?

324
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,600
<11-8,Howard>我不会回答的
<11-8,Howard>I'm not answering that.

325
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,830
<11-8,Howard>这是个陷阱
<11-8,Howard>It's a trap.

326
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:26,810
<11-9,Bernadette>所以你对我有意见
<11-9,Bernadette>So there are things you don't like.

327
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:29,330
<11-10,Howard>我已经踩进陷阱夹里了
<11-10,Howard>And here I am in the trap.

328
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,510
<11-10,Howard>你继续说
<11-10,Howard>You just keep talking.

329
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:34,640
<11-10,Howard>我要啃断腿来逃生了
<11-10,Howard>I'm gonna chew my leg off.

330
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:37,210
<11-11,Bernadette>就告诉我一件你不满意的事
<11-11,Bernadette>Just tell me one thing that bothers you,

331
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,250
<11-11,Bernadette>我保证不生气
<11-11,Bernadette>and I promise I won't get mad.

332
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,920
<11-12,Howard>好吧  事实上
<11-12,Howard>Okay. The truth is...

333
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,440
<11-12,Howard>有时候...你太过...
<11-12,Howard>sometimes... you're too...

334
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,270
<11-12,Howard>美丽
<11-12,Howard>beautiful.

335
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,380
<11-13,Bernadette>华仔  严肃点
<11-13,Bernadette>Howie, be serious.

336
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,090
<11-14,Howard>好吧  好吧
<11-14,Howard>dort dort dort Okay, okay.

337
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:54,940
<11-14,Howard>我实在不喜欢
<11-14,Howard>I really don't like

338
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:57,140
<11-14,Howard>睡觉时被你的翅膀戳醒
<11-14,Howard>how your wings poke me when we sleep

339
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:59,030
<11-14,Howard>因为你是坠落凡间的天使
<11-14,Howard>'cause you're an angel.

340
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,880
<11-15,Bernadette>好吧  也许这个提议不怎么样
<11-15,Bernadette>Okay, fine, maybe it was a bad idea.

341
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,680
<11-16,Howard>我只是不觉得幸福婚姻的秘诀
<11-16,Howard>I just don't think the secret to a happy marriage

342
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,760
<11-16,Howard>是互相批评对方
<11-16,Howard>is going out of our way to criticize each other.

343
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:12,910
<11-16,Howard>不过  要加强沟通的方法很多
<11-16,Howard>Although, there are ways to improve our communication.

344
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:15,530
<11-16,Howard>我曾经在伴侣心理治疗那里学到过...
<11-16,Howard>One thing I learned when I was in couples therapy was...

345
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:17,110
<11-17,Bernadette>你和谁一起去的伴侣心理治疗
<11-17,Bernadette>Who were you in couples therapy with?

346
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:18,570
<11-18,Howard>这不重要
<11-18,Howard>Not important.

347
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,420
<11-19,Bernadette>是和你妈吗
<11-19,Bernadette>Was it your mom?

348
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,680
<11-18,Howard>这不重要
<11-18,Howard>Not important.

349
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:25,160
<11-21,Bernadette>所以是和你妈了
<11-21,Bernadette>It was your mom.

350
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,000
<11-22,Howard>总之  治疗师让我们互相倾诉
<11-22,Howard>Anyway, the therapist had us tell each other

351
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,920
<11-22,Howard>喜欢对方的哪一点
<11-22,Howard>what we loved about one another.

352
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,650
<11-23,Bernadette>这方法好贴心
<11-23,Bernadette>Oh, that's so sweet!

353
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:35,010
<11-23,Bernadette>我想试试这个
<11-23,Bernadette>I want to do that.

354
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,230
<11-24,Howard>好啊
<11-24,Howard>All right.

355
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:38,460
<11-25,Bernadette>那么...
<11-25,Bernadette>Okay, um...

356
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:41,480
<11-25,Bernadette>我喜欢你能逗我开心
<11-25,Bernadette>I love that you make me laugh.

357
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,810
<11-25,Bernadette>谢谢
<11-25,Bernadette>Thank you.

358
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:47,920
<11-26,Howard>我喜欢你自强又自立
<11-26,Howard>And I love that you're strong and independent.

359
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,950
<11-27,Bernadette>但我也喜欢你会帮我撑着门
<11-27,Bernadette>And yet, I still love when you hold a door for me.

360
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,830
<11-28,Howard>我喜欢我在家里好吃懒做
<11-28,Howard>I love that I'm kind of a slob around here, and...

361
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:57,180
<11-28,Howard>你却毫不介意
<11-28,Howard>you're okay with that.

362
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:02,290
<11-29,Bernadette>呵呵
<11-29,Bernadette>Uh-huh.

363
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:06,080
<11-29,Bernadette>我喜欢我又得工作又得做家务
<11-29,Bernadette>And I love that I work and do all the cleaning,

364
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,310
<11-28,Howard>你却毫不介意
<11-28,Howard>and you're okay with that.

365
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:11,000
<11-30,Howard>我还真不介意

00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,640
<12-2,Sheldon>这都是你的错
<12-2,Sheldon>You know this is all your fault.

370
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:29,490
<12-3,Leonard>怎么是我的错

371
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,740
<12-4,Sheldon>我告诉你别去做手术了
<12-4,Sheldon>I told you not to get the surgery.

372
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:37,100
<12-5,Leonard>首先  手术非常成功
<12-5,Leonard>Okay, first of all, the surgery was a success,

373
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,680
<12-5,Leonard>其次  我根本不想要你去
<12-5,Leonard>and secondly, I didn't even want you there.

374
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:42,640
<12-6,Sheldon>我不知道哪里更痛
<12-6,Sheldon>I don't know which hurts worse--

375
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,860
<12-6,Sheldon>我的鼻子还是我的心
<12-6,Sheldon>my nose or my heart.

<12-6,Sheldon>够了  我不想跟你说话了

00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:48,750
<12-7,Amy>别这样
<12-7,Amy>Don't be like that.

00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,390
<12-7,Amy>你们俩必须谈清楚

382
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:02,130
<12-10,Sheldon>你别以为自己脱离险境了
<12-10,Sheldon>Oh, you're hardly out of the woods, no.

383
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:05,390
<12-10,Sheldon>你还有可能手术感染  出现血栓
<12-10,Sheldon>You still run the risk of infection, a blood clot,

384
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:07,420
<12-10,Sheldon>还有手术疏忽使得蜘蛛爬进
<12-10,Sheldon>the possibility that an inattentive surgeon

385
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:10,650
<12-10,Sheldon>你的鼻子产卵的风险

<12-10,Sheldon>你只要擤出蜘蛛网来  我立马就搬家
<12-10,Sheldon>The minute you sneeze web, I'm moving out.

387
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,480
<12-11,Leonard>我从没想过自己会说这些话
<12-11,Leonard>I never thought I'd say these words,

390
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,110
<12-12,Penny>你多害怕莱纳德会死啊
<12-12,Penny>You were so panicked Leonard was gonna die,

00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,330
<12-12,Penny>你永远离不开他的
<12-12,Penny>you'll never leave him.

392
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:27,110
<12-13,Amy>谢尔顿终究会搬出去的
<12-13,Amy>Sheldon will move out eventually.

393

<12-14,Penny>没错  等他学会如何开门以后
<12-14,Penny>Yeah, once he figures out how to work a door.

394
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,840
<12-15,Sheldon>我没有害怕  我也不依赖莱纳德
<12-15,Sheldon>I was not panicked, and I am not overly attached to Leonard.

395
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,930
<12-16,Leonard>你担心得不顾自己破相
<12-16,Leonard>You were so worried that you smashed your face

<12-17,Sheldon>才能说出这种话来
<12-17,Sheldon>with a spider eating its way through his brain.
