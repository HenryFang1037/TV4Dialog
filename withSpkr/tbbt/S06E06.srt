00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:16,250
<1-1,Raj>跟上舞步啊  霍华德
<1-1,Raj>Try to keep up, Howard!

3
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,910
<1-1,Raj>哥舞力全开呢
<1-1,Raj>I'm killing it!

4
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,390
<1-2,Howard>真希望我们在舞厅跳舞时
<1-2,Howard>Yeah, I wish we looked as cool dancing in clubs

5
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,430
<1-2,Howard>跟现在一样帅
<1-2,Howard>as we do right now.

6
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:26,310
<1-3,Leonard>别担心  你们在舞厅跳舞时
<1-3,Leonard>Don't worry, this is exactly how you look

7
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,200
<1-3,Leonard>就是你们现在这副样
<1-3,Leonard>when you're dancing in clubs.

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,690
<1-4,Raj>女士们  不用谢
<1-4,Raj>You're welcome, ladies.

9
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:34,870
<1-5,Sheldon>超大新闻啊  男士们
<1-5,Sheldon>Paradigm-shifting news, gentlemen!

<1-6,Raj>兄弟
<1-6,Raj>Dude!

11
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:38,840
<1-6,Raj>我正要上前舞翻那骚妞呢
<1-6,Raj>I was about to Bollywood this bitch.

12
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,040
<1-7,Sheldon>早先
<1-7,Sheldon>Earlier today,

13
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,310
<1-7,Sheldon>我邀请了史蒂芬·霍金教授与我玩
<1-7,Sheldon>I invited Professor Stephen Hawking to join me

14
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,840
<1-7,Sheldon>风靡网络的小游戏《填字游戏》
<1-7,Sheldon>in the popular online game Words with Friends.

15
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:49,900
<1-7,Sheldon>跨平台的知名线上填字游戏
<1-7,Sheldon>游戏名字还有  与朋友谈话/吵架[填字]的意思

16
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,900
<1-7,Sheldon>他刚刚同意了我的游戏邀请
<1-7,Sheldon>Moments ago, he accepted my request.

17
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,290
<1-7,Sheldon>你们知道这代表什么意思吗
<1-7,Sheldon>Do you understand what that means?

18
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:54,270
<1-8,Howard>霍金教授正在地球上的某处说着
<1-8,Howard>That somewhere right now Stephen Hawking is saying,

19
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,060
<1-8,Howard>"靠
<1-8,Howard>"Damn it.

20
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,250
<1-8,Howard>我本来是要按拒绝的"
<1-8,Howard>I meant to click no."

21
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:02,730
<1-9,Sheldon>我来解释给你们听吧
<1-9,Sheldon>I'll walk you through it.

22
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,430
<1-9,Sheldon>这游戏可不是叫"与陌生人玩填字"
<1-9,Sheldon>The game is not called Words with Strangers.

23
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:08,000
<1-9,Sheldon>也不是叫
<1-9,Sheldon>No, it's not even called

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,780
<1-9,Sheldon>"与相识的人玩填字"
<1-9,Sheldon>Words with Acquaintances.

25
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,910
<1-9,Sheldon>而是叫"与...
<1-9,Sheldon>It is called Words with...

26
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:16,090
<1-10,Raj>我才不接你的话
<1-10,Raj>I'm not finishing your sentence.

27
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:18,270
<1-10,Raj>哥舞翻全场时  你居然关我游戏
<1-10,Raj>You pulled the plug on my funk.

28
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:20,150
<1-10,Raj>"与朋友"
<1-10,Raj>Friends!

29
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:21,850
<1-11,Sheldon>是"与朋友玩填字"游戏
<1-11,Sheldon>It's Words with Friends!

30
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:24,260
<1-11,Sheldon>代表着我与霍金正式成为朋友了
<1-11,Sheldon>Which Stephen Hawking and I officially are.

31
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,950
<1-11,Sheldon>只要再拥有个双层床与溜滑梯
<1-11,Sheldon>Now all I need is a bunk bed with a slide;

32
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:28,350
<1-11,Sheldon>我六岁时就许下的愿望
<1-11,Sheldon>I'll have everything I've ever wanted

33
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:30,020
<1-11,Sheldon>就全都圆满了
<1-11,Sheldon>since I was six years old.

34
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,860
<1-12,Leonard>谢尔顿  那挺好啊
<1-12,Leonard>That's really nice, Sheldon.

35
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:32,770
<1-12,Leonard>我也替你开心
<1-12,Leonard>I'm happy for you.

36
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:34,590
<1-13,Sheldon>我也替你开心
<1-13,Sheldon>And I'm happy for you, too.

37
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,090
<1-13,Sheldon>因为你现在成了
<1-13,Sheldon>You are now friends with someone

38
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:38,560
<1-13,Sheldon>史蒂芬·霍金朋友的朋友
<1-13,Sheldon>who is officially friends with Stephen Hawking.

39
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,760
<1-13,Sheldon>慢慢乐吧  同志们
<1-13,Sheldon>Enjoy it, boys.

40
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,310
<1-13,Sheldon>可能是你们人生的最高点啊
<1-13,Sheldon>You may have peaked.

41
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:44,100
<1-14,Howard>谢尔顿  我也认识史蒂芬·霍金
<1-14,Howard>Sheldon, I know Stephen Hawking.

42
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,000
<1-14,Howard>我与他共事过
<1-14,Howard>I worked with him.

43
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,770
<1-15,Sheldon>等哪天出了款
<1-15,Sheldon>And if they ever come out with a game called

44
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:48,440
<1-15,Sheldon>"与曾共事过的人玩填字"的游戏
<1-15,Sheldon>Words with People You Once Worked with,

45
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,240
<1-15,Sheldon>才轮你上场
<1-15,Sheldon>you'll be off to the races.

46
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,880
<1-16,Leonard>谢尔顿  玩个游戏也不代表...
<1-16,Leonard>Sheldon, I don't think this actually means...

47
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,490
<1-17,Sheldon>话别说太早
<1-17,Sheldon>Hold that thought!

48
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,250
<1-17,Sheldon>"霍金教授下了一步"
<1-17,Sheldon>Professor Hawking has made a move.

49
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,670
<1-17,Sheldon>哎哟妈呀
<1-17,Sheldon>Boy, oh boy.

50
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,470
<1-17,Sheldon>要不了多久
<1-17,Sheldon>Oh, it's only a matter of time

51
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:04,480
<1-17,Sheldon>我们俩就会开始互取好玩绰号了
<1-17,Sheldon>before we're coming up with fun nicknames for each other.

52
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,370
<1-17,Sheldon>他喊我"鸡笼弟"
<1-17,Sheldon>I'll be Coop.

54
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,230
<1-17,Sheldon>我叫他"轮子哥"
<1-17,Sheldon>He'll be Wheels.

55
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:12,640
<1-17,Sheldon>前提是他不介意的话啦
<1-17,Sheldon>If he's okay with that.

56
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,720
<1-17,Sheldon>好的
<1-17,Sheldon>All right.

57
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,630
<1-18,Raj (putting game back on and removing shirt)>开大空调吧
<1-18,Raj (putting game back on and removing shirt)>Crank up the AC, boy!

58
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:20,710
<1-18,Raj (putting game back on and removing shirt)>哥要热翻全场啦
<1-18,Raj (putting game back on and removing shirt)>It's gonna get hot in here!

60
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,410
<2-1,Bernadette>今早我洗了个澡
<2-1,Bernadette>So, I was taking a shower this morning,

61
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:52,620
<2-1,Bernadette>洗完出来  就拿起了旁边
<2-1,Bernadette>and when I got out, I started to dry off with

62
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,930
<2-1,Bernadette>看似浴巾的东西擦身子
<2-1,Bernadette>what I thought was a towel

63
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:57,010
<2-1,Bernadette>结果发现那是霍华德他妈的内裤
<2-1,Bernadette>but turned out to be Howard's mom's underwear.

64
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,120
<2-1,Bernadette>害我得重洗了一次澡
<2-1,Bernadette>I had to take another shower.

65
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:07,570
<2-1,Bernadette>但洗了也没用
<2-1,Bernadette>It wasn't enough.

66
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:12,250
<2-1,Bernadette>洗得了身子  洗不去创伤
<2-1,Bernadette>Nothing will ever be enough.

67
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:15,770
<2-2,Amy>有一次我瞧了谢尔顿的内裤抽屉
<2-2,Amy>I once looked in Sheldon's underwear drawer.

68
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:17,110
<2-2,Amy>被他骂了
<2-2,Amy>He yelled at me.

69
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,700
<2-2,Amy>但那份内裤的记忆将永存我心
<2-2,Amy>But now I know what it looks like

70
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,990
<2-2,Amy>他收不回也抢不走
<2-2,Amy>and he can never take that away.

71
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,420
<2-3,Bernadette>这下面有本书呢
<2-3,Bernadette>There's a book under here.

72
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,490
<2-4,Penny>我自己捡吧
<2-4,Penny>Oh, I'll get that.

73
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:25,090
<2-5,Bernadette>-不用  我捡到了  -别  那是...
<2-5,Bernadette>- I got it. I got it. - No, no, it's...

74
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,640
<2-7,Bernadette>你怎么会有一本历史课本啊
<2-7,Bernadette>Why do you have a history textbook?

75
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,600
<2-8,Penny>没什么啦
<2-8,Penny>It's not a big deal.

76
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,720
<2-8,Penny>我就去了帕萨迪纳社区大学上课嘛
<2-8,Penny>Just taking a class at the Pasadena Community College.

77
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,860
<2-8,Penny>这很好啊
<2-8,Penny>That's great.

78
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,460
<2-9,Bernadette>我都不知道你还想再读书
<2-9,Bernadette>I didn't know you wanted to go back to school.

79
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,930
<2-10,Penny>只是上个历史课啦
<2-10,Penny>It's just one history class.

80
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,060
<2-10,Penny>当年没读完大学
<2-10,Penny>Look, I didn't finish college,

81
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,270
<2-10,Penny>就想说再试一下
<2-10,Penny>so I thought I would give it a try.

82
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,690
<2-11,Amy>反正你的演艺事业
<2-11,Amy>Not to mention, your acting career

83
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:44,900
<2-11,Amy>也如同佘曼将军  一路向南[失败]
<2-11,Amy>is going south like Sherman.

84
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:44,900
<2-11,Amy>威廉·特库姆塞·佘曼
<2-11,Amy>美国南北战争中的北部联邦军将领

85
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,120
<2-11,Amy>翻你的历史课本就懂了
<2-11,Amy>Read about it in your book.

86
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:51,780
<2-12,Bernadette>为什么不好意思告诉我们呢
<2-12,Bernadette>Why would you be embarrassed to tell us?

87
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,880
<2-13,Penny>不是的  我是不想让任何人知道
<2-13,Penny>No, I'm not embarrassed. I just didn't want anyone to know

88
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:55,600
<2-13,Penny>我还没告诉莱纳德嘛
<2-13,Penny>because I haven't told Leonard yet.

89
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,070
<2-14,Amy>那你为什么不告诉他呢
<2-14,Amy>Why wouldn't you tell Leonard?

90
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,040
<2-15,Penny>他听到他女朋友重回学校
<2-15,Penny>Because it's me going back to school,

91
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,300
<2-15,Penny>肯定会说"你行的"  "我怎么帮你呢"
<2-15,Penny>and he's gonna be all "You can do it," and "How can I help?"

92
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,620
<2-15,Penny>以及"我超以你为荣"
<2-15,Penny>and "I'm so proud of you."

93
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,260
<2-16,Bernadette>真不敢相信
<2-16,Bernadette>I just can't believe you could

94
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,860
<2-16,Bernadette>这么大的事情  你居然瞒着他
<2-16,Bernadette>keep something like that from him.

95
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,550
<2-17,Amy>你们绝对是我认识最怪的一对情侣了
<2-17,Amy>You guys have got to be the weirdest couple I know.

96
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,500
<2-17,Amy>是吗
<2-17,Amy>Really?

97
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:24,080
<2-18,Penny>你想不到更怪的了吗
<2-18,Penny>You can't think of anyone weirder?

98
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,860
<2-19,Amy>可以啊
<2-19,Amy>I can,

99
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,180
<2-19,Amy>不过那人就坐在那里呢
<2-19,Amy>but she's sitting right there.

100
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,640
<2-19,Amy>很好
<2-19,Amy>Yes!

101
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:38,330
<3-1,Sheldon>我拼Quiver[箭袋]  配合一个3倍加成
<3-1,Sheldon>I play the word "Quiver" with a triple letter

102
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:41,930
<3-1,Sheldon>以及一个2倍加成  得72分
<3-1,Sheldon>and a double word score for 72 points.

103
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:45,270
<3-1,Sheldon>把你的轮椅胎给打爆了吧  霍金
<3-1,Sheldon>That ought to let the air out of your tires, Hawking.

104
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:50,460
<3-2,Amy>我的男朋友与史蒂芬·霍金是朋友
<3-2,Amy>Wow, my boyfriend is friends with Stephen Hawking

105
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,110
<3-2,Amy>我的新去屑洗发水味道也不是柏油味
<3-2,Amy>and my new dandruff shampoo doesn't smell like tar.

106
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,770
<3-2,Amy>真是守得云开见月明了啊  艾米
<3-2,Amy>Everything really is coming up, Amy.

107
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,130
<3-3,Sheldon>的确挺光荣
<3-3,Sheldon>It is glorious.

108
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:02,580
<3-3,Sheldon>当代最具智慧的人之一
<3-3,Sheldon>One of the greatest intellects of our time

109
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:06,000
<3-3,Sheldon>同意与我进行智力上的君子之争
<3-3,Sheldon>has agreed to engage with me in a gentlemanly battle of wits.

110
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,970
<3-3,Sheldon>而且我还虐翻了他
<3-3,Sheldon>And I'm spanking him so hard

111
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:10,490
<3-3,Sheldon>估计他带的研究生也要被他虐翻了
<3-3,Sheldon>his grad students won't be able to sit down.

112
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:14,130
<3-4,Amy>当一名男性彻底压制另一男性时
<3-4,Amy>You know, when one male dominates another,

113
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:16,410
<3-4,Amy>他的睾丸酮会上升
<3-4,Amy>his testosterone level rises.

114
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:17,770
<3-4,Amy>睾丸酮是一种雄性激素
<3-4,Amy>有维持男性第二性征和性欲的作用

115
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:17,770
<3-5,Sheldon>说这个干嘛
<3-5,Sheldon>What's your point?

116
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:20,990
<3-6,Amy>想到你会有睾丸酮就兴奋嘛
<3-6,Amy>It's exciting to think you might be getting a testosterone level.

117
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:28,650
<3-7,Sheldon>我的好友史蒂芬
<3-7,Sheldon>My friend Stephen

118
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:31,470
<3-7,Sheldon>拼了Act[行动]  得18分
<3-7,Sheldon>just played the word "Act" for 18 points.

119
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:34,340
<3-7,Sheldon>是的  我现在直呼他名字
<3-7,Sheldon>That's right, I call him Stephen now.

120
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:37,710
<3-7,Sheldon>我问过他了  他不接受"轮子哥"的绰号
<3-7,Sheldon>Because I checked, and he was not okay with Wheels.

121
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,310
<3-8,Amy>你可以把他的Act连成Extract[提取]
<3-8,Amy>Oh, you could turn his "Act" into "Extract,"

122
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,530
<3-8,Amy>这样的话分能加倍
<3-8,Amy>and it would be for double points.

123
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:44,760
<3-9,Sheldon>艾米
<3-9,Sheldon>Amy.

124
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,420
<3-9,Sheldon>你干嘛直接告诉我一个答案呢
<3-9,Sheldon>Why would you give me a word?

125
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:49,440
<3-9,Sheldon>如果我拼了这个字  我就是作弊
<3-9,Sheldon>Now, if I play "Extract," it would be cheating.

126
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,280
<3-10,Amy>抱歉
<3-10,Amy>Sorry.

127
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,740
<3-11,Sheldon>不过我可以填一个完全不相关的
<3-11,Sheldon>Although, I could play the completely unrelated

128
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:56,140
<3-11,Sheldon>更好字眼Extract[萃取物  一字多义]
<3-11,Sheldon>and better word "Extract."

129
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,610
<3-11,Sheldon>成功避免道德难题
<3-11,Sheldon>Ethical conundrum avoided.

130
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,770
<3-11,Sheldon>谢谢你  大脑
<3-11,Sheldon>Thanks, brain.

131
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,220
<4-1,Penny>意大利面好吃吗
<4-1,Penny>Spaghetti okay?

132
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,790
<4-2,Leonard>很"脆"
<4-2,Leonard>It's crunchy.

133
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,480
<4-2,Leonard>我就爱这样的
<4-2,Leonard>Just the way I like it.

134
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,680
<4-3,Penny>好啦  那水我也觉得没烧开
<4-3,Penny>Yeah, I don't think the water was really boiling.

135
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,400
<4-4,Leonard>挺好的  我很喜欢啦
<4-4,Leonard>It's great. I love it.

136
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,450
<4-5,Penny>听着  我有事情要告诉你
<4-5,Penny>Okay, listen, there's something I need to tell you.

137
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,880
<4-5,Penny>我考虑重返校园有一段时间了
<4-5,Penny>I've been thinking about going back to school for a while now.

138
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,020
<4-5,Penny>所以一个月前
<4-5,Penny>So a couple months ago,

139
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,850
<4-5,Penny>我在一家社区大学报读了历史课
<4-5,Penny>I started taking a history class at the community college.

140
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,970
<4-6,Leonard>这真是太棒了  棒极了  超棒的
<4-6,Leonard>That's great! Great, great, great!

141
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:34,810
<4-6,Leonard>干嘛拖这么久才告诉我呢
<4-6,Leonard>Why wait so long to tell me?

142
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:36,650
<4-7,Penny>因为我不想你小题大作
<4-7,Penny>I don't want you to make a big deal out of it.

143
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:38,380
<4-8,Leonard>你为什么会这样想我呢
<4-8,Leonard>Why do you think I'd be like that?

144
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,470
<4-8,Leonard>我懂  你报了一门课  很好啊
<4-8,Leonard>I get it, you're taking one class. It's nice.

145
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:41,250
<4-8,Leonard>如果一切顺利
<4-8,Leonard>Maybe if it goes well,

146
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,760
<4-8,Leonard>可以再报一门  然后变成全日制学生
<4-8,Leonard>you take another, you enroll full-time.

147
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,240
<4-8,Leonard>对了  记得注意下
<4-8,Leonard>Ooh, be sure to keep an eye on

148
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,460
<4-8,Leonard>哪些学分是能转修成四年制大学的
<4-8,Leonard>which credits transfer to a four-year college.

149
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,660
<4-9,Penny>你现在就是在小题大作
<4-9,Penny>You're making it a big deal.

150
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,390
<4-10,Leonard>抱歉  那随便吧
<4-10,Leonard>Sorry. Whatever.

151
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:51,820
<4-10,Leonard>都好
<4-10,Leonard>It's all good.

152
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,350
<4-11,Penny>总之  就是这样
<4-11,Penny>Anyway, that's it.

153
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,930
<4-11,Penny>我就觉得该知会你一声
<4-11,Penny>I just thought you should know.

154
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,190
<4-12,Leonard>我能问问课上得怎么样吗
<4-12,Leonard>Am I allowed to ask how the class is going?

155
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,160
<4-13,Penny>相当不错
<4-13,Penny>It's really good.

156
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,000
<4-13,Penny>我们在学有关奴隶的起源
<4-13,Penny>We've been talking about the origins of slavery.

157
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,480
<4-13,Penny>明天就要上交我第一篇论文
<4-13,Penny>Turn in my first paper tomorrow.

158
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,040
<4-14,Leonard>好主题  我可以帮你
<4-14,Leonard>Great topic. I can help with that.

159
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,900
<4-14,Leonard>你可以从很多不同的观点来论述
<4-14,Leonard>There are lots of different perspectives you can take:

160
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,760
<4-14,Leonard>比如经济  社会  政治
<4-14,Leonard>economic, sociological, political...

161
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,590
<4-15,Penny>喂  这是我的论文
<4-15,Penny>Hey, this is my paper.

162
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:12,490
<4-15,Penny>我的观点就是  奴隶是坏事
<4-15,Penny>And my perspective is that slavery is bad.

163
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,480
<4-15,Penny>我的教授是黑人
<4-15,Penny>Oh, and my professor's black,

164
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,670
<4-15,Penny>所以我确信这就是正确的答案
<4-15,Penny>so I'm pretty sure that's the right answer.

165
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,150
<4-16,Leonard>-我能看看吗  -不行
<4-16,Leonard>- Can I take a look? - No,

166
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:23,750
<4-17,Penny>莱纳德  这是我的东西
<4-17,Penny>Leonard, this is my thing.

167
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,290
<4-18,Leonard>-好吧  我知道了  -多谢理解
<4-18,Leonard>- Okay, I get it. - Thank you.

168
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,430
<4-20,Leonard>这像我开始练引体向上时
<4-20,Leonard>It's like when I started doing chin-ups;

169
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,610
<4-20,Leonard>做不到一个前  我都没脸让你看
<4-20,Leonard>I didn't want you to see until I could do one.

170
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:35,210
<4-20,Leonard>顺便说一声  差点就成功了
<4-20,Leonard>FYI, really close.

171
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,230
<4-19,Penny>谢谢
<4-19,Penny>Thank you.

172
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:38,860
<4-21,Penny>现在给我乖乖地吃饭
<4-21,Penny>Now behave yourself and eat your dinner.

173
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:39,970
<4-21,Penny>晚点  运气好的话
<4-21,Penny>Maybe later, if you're lucky,

174
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:41,840
<4-21,Penny>你或许可以跟一个大学生上床哟
<4-21,Penny>you get to sleep with a college girl.

175
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,910
<4-21,Penny>真的吗
<4-21,Penny>Really?

176
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:44,110
<4-22,Leonard>我念了四年大学
<4-22,Leonard>'Cause I went to four years of college

177
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,720
<4-22,Leonard>五年研究生院  这种好事一次都没发生过
<4-22,Leonard>and five years of grad school, that never happened once.

178
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,050
<5-1,Raj>下次我跟在印度的客服中心讲话时
<5-1,Raj>I think the next time I have to speak to a call center in India,

179
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:55,640
<5-1,Raj>我要试着用美国口语
<5-1,Raj>I'm going to try using an American accent.

180
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:00,330
<5-2,Howard>为什么
<5-2,Howard>Why?

181
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:02,480
<5-3,Raj>因为用正常声音说话
<5-3,Raj>Because when I use my regular voice,

182
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,760
<5-3,Raj>我会觉得我好像在逗他们玩
<5-3,Raj>I feel like I'm making fun of them.

183
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,810
<5-4,Howard>这理由太可笑了吧
<5-4,Howard>That's ridiculous.

184
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:10,930
<5-4,Howard>而且你的美国口音烂死了
<5-4,Howard>Not to mention, your American accent is terrible.

185
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:12,840
<5-5,Raj>伙计  我的口音超棒的
<5-5,Raj>Dude, my accent is brilliant.

186
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,450
<5-5,Raj>我白皮肤的美国朋友们
<5-5,Raj>Hey, my snow-white American friends,

187
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,320
<5-5,Raj>让我们把牛肉放上烤肉架
<5-5,Raj>let's put some cow meat on the barbecue

188
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,770
<5-5,Raj>然后猛吃  直到吃成死胖子
<5-5,Raj>and eat it until we're all obese.

189
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,150
<5-6,Howard>你其实是像这样
<5-6,Howard>This is what you sound like.

190
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:25,590
<5-6,Howard>我觉得我在用美国口音说话
<5-6,Howard>I think I'm talking in an American accent,

191
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:26,810
<5-6,Howard>但听起来却是
<5-6,Howard>but it really sounds like

192
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:29,860
<5-6,Howard>我正戴着一副不合嘴的假牙说话
<5-6,Howard>I'm wearing a set of giant dentures.

193
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,820
<5-7,Raj>谢尔顿  我听起来真的像那样吗
<5-7,Raj>Sheldon, do I really sound like that?

194
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,120
<5-8,Howard>告诉他就是那样
<5-8,Howard>Tell him he sounds like that.

195
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:39,060
<5-9,Raj>谢尔顿  你没事吧
<5-9,Raj>Sheldon, you okay?

196
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:42,170
<5-10,Sheldon>这都三天了
<5-10,Sheldon>It's been three days.

197
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:45,000
<5-10,Sheldon>为什么史蒂芬·霍金还没拼一个字
<5-10,Sheldon>Why hasn't Stephen Hawking played a word?

198
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:47,910
<5-11,Raj>那家伙是天才
<5-11,Raj>The guy's a genius.

199
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,890
<5-11,Raj>或许你对他来说  挑战性不够
<5-11,Raj>Maybe you weren't challenging enough for him.

200
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:51,100
<5-12,Sheldon>不够挑战性
<5-12,Sheldon>Not challenging?

201
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,930
<5-12,Sheldon>我把他虐爆了好吗
<5-12,Sheldon>I was humiliating the man.

202
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:54,600
<5-12,Sheldon>我还在想出一本书  名叫
<5-12,Sheldon>I was thinking of writing a book called

203
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,920
<5-12,Sheldon>《时间简史之
<5-12,Sheldon>A Brief History of the Time

205
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,810
<5-12,Sheldon>我让史蒂芬·霍金痛哭流涕》
<5-12,Sheldon>I Made Stephen Hawking Cry Like a Little Girl.

206
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,670
<5-13,Howard>这就是问题所在
<5-13,Howard>There's the problem.

207
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,510
<5-13,Howard>你不能这样打败霍金
<5-13,Howard>You can't beat Hawking like that.

208
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,750
<5-13,Howard>他讨厌输
<5-13,Howard>He hates to lose.

209
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,000
<5-13,Howard>大家都知道他脾气跟小孩一样
<5-13,Howard>Everyone knows the guy's a big baby.

210
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,620
<5-13,Howard>他不应该坐轮椅  他应该坐婴儿车才对
<5-13,Howard>I mean, forget the wheelchair, he should be in a stroller.

211
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:14,470
<5-14,Sheldon>真的吗
<5-14,Sheldon>Really?

212
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,360
<5-15,Howard>有次我跟他共事时
<5-15,Howard>One time when I was working with him,

213
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,370
<5-15,Howard>他说强尼·戴普有参演《黑客帝国》
<5-15,Howard>he said that Johnny Depp was in The Matrix.

214
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:22,280
<5-15,Howard>我告诉他记错了  可他仍死命坚持
<5-15,Howard>I told him he was wrong, but he kept insisting.

215
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,780
<5-15,Howard>于是我把再网上查出来的结果给他看
<5-15,Howard>So I looked it up online and showed him.

216
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:27,590
<5-15,Howard>然后第二天  他举办了个披萨派对
<5-15,Howard>Well, the next day, he had a pizza party,

217
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:31,150
<5-15,Howard>大家都被邀请了  唯独我没有
<5-15,Howard>and everyone got invited but me.

218
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,740
<5-15,Howard>然后他就说
<5-15,Howard>And then he was all,

219
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,950
<5-15,Howard>"可能你的邀请函丢在母体里了吧"
<5-15,Howard>"Your invitation must have gotten lost in the matrix."

220
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:45,030
<5-16,Sheldon>上帝啊  我都做了什么啊
<5-16,Sheldon>Good Lord, what have I done?

221
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:47,220
<5-16,Sheldon>上帝啊  我都做了什么啊
<5-16,Sheldon>Good Lord, what have I done?

222
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,320
<5-18,Howard>烂死了
<5-18,Howard>Terrible.

223
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,960
<5-19,Raj>好吧  高手  那你说印度口音试试
<5-19,Raj>All right, hotshot, let's hear your Indian.

224
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,440
<5-20,Howard>我不能坐上那头大象
<5-20,Howard>I can't sit on that elephant,

225
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,790
<5-20,Howard>因为吃了咖喱  我火烧火燎地想拉肚子
<5-20,Howard>my ass is on fire from eating all this curry.

226
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,690
<5-21,Raj>好吧  说得真好

<7-4,Leonard>我做了件坏事
<7-4,Leonard>I did a bad thing.

<7-5,Sheldon>- Does it affect me? - No.

242
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:24,830
<7-7,Sheldon>那你默默忍受吧
<7-7,Sheldon>Then suffer in silence.

243
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:26,590
<7-7,Sheldon>拼字
<7-7,Sheldon>Play.

244
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:29,790
<7-7,Sheldon>拼字  拼字
<7-7,Sheldon>Play. Play.

245
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,000
<7-7,Sheldon>史蒂芬·霍金...
<7-7,Sheldon>Stephen Hawking...

246
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,070
<7-7,Sheldon>史蒂芬·霍金...  史蒂芬·霍金
<7-7,Sheldon>Stephen Hawking... Stephen Hawking.

247
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:38,570
<7-8,Leonard>佩妮报读了一个班
<7-8,Leonard>Penny started taking a class.

248
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:40,460
<7-8,Leonard>她写了篇论文  但不给我看
<7-8,Leonard>She wrote a paper, she didn't want me to read it,

249
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,330
<7-8,Leonard>但我背着她偷偷看完了
<7-8,Leonard>I went behind her back and I read it anyway.

250
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:44,550
<7-9,Sheldon>史蒂芬·霍金讨厌我
<7-9,Sheldon>Stephen Hawking hates me.

251
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:46,170
<7-9,Sheldon>我不知道怎么办才好
<7-9,Sheldon>I don't know what to do.

252
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,940
<7-10,Leonard>她那论文写的糟透了
<7-10,Leonard>I mean, the paper's terrible.

253
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,990
<7-10,Leonard>但如果我告诉她  她就知道我看过了
<7-10,Leonard>But if I tell her, she'll know that I read it

254
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:51,430
<7-10,Leonard>她一定会很生气
<7-10,Leonard>and she'll get really mad.

255
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,260
<7-11,Sheldon>我把他虐得太惨
<7-11,Sheldon>I was beating him so bad,

256
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,470
<7-11,Sheldon>他不想跟我做朋友了
<7-11,Sheldon>he doesn't want to be friends anymore.

257
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,580
<7-11,Sheldon>大家都喜欢我  为何史蒂芬·霍金不这样呢
<7-11,Sheldon>Why does everyone love me except Stephen Hawking?

258
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:01,620
<7-12,Leonard>咱俩讨论的貌似不是同一件事吧
<7-12,Leonard>Is it possible we're having two different conversations?

259
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,410
<7-13,Sheldon>我怎么知道  我又没听你说什么
<7-13,Sheldon>How would I know? I'm not listening to you.

260
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:06,880
<7-14,Leonard>等一下
<7-14,Leonard>Hang on.

261
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:09,970
<7-14,Leonard>有了
<7-14,Leonard>Okay.

262
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:10,920
<7-14,Leonard>我们接下来这么干
<7-14,Leonard>Here's what we're gonna do.

263
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,050
<7-14,Leonard>赛棋钟
<7-14,Leonard>Chess clock.

264
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:14,470
<7-14,Leonard>我们每人有5分钟说自己的麻烦
<7-14,Leonard>We each get five minutes to talk about our problems.

265
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:15,220
<7-14,Leonard>轮流说
<7-14,Leonard>We'll take turns.

266
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,900
<7-14,Leonard>每一轮包括自我陈述
<7-14,Leonard>Each turn will consist of a statement

267
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,980
<7-14,Leonard>以及朋友提出的有益建议
<7-14,Leonard>and a helpful response from the friend.

268
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,730
<7-14,Leonard>计时开始
<7-14,Leonard>Begin.

269
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:25,650
<7-15,Sheldon>我在《填字游戏》中虐了史蒂芬·霍金
<7-15,Sheldon>I humiliated Stephen Hawking in a game of Words with Friends.

270
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:26,800
<7-15,Sheldon>结果他不玩了
<7-15,Sheldon>He stopped playing.

271
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,460
<7-15,Sheldon>现在我们已不再是朋友了
<7-15,Sheldon>And now we're not friends anymore.

272
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,450
<7-16,Leonard>他可能很忙呢
<7-16,Leonard>He's probably busy.

273
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:31,520
<7-16,Leonard>你没必要担心
<7-16,Leonard>You're worried about nothing.

274
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,430
<7-16,Leonard>再给他几天时间
<7-16,Leonard>Give it a couple more days.

275
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:35,190
<7-16,Leonard>他会玩的  你就会发现一切都没事
<7-16,Leonard>I'm sure he'll play, and you'll see that everything's fine.

276
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:36,780
<7-16,Leonard>到我了
<7-16,Leonard>My turn.

277
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,740
<7-16,Leonard>我不能让佩妮交这么一篇烂论文
<7-16,Leonard>I can't let Penny hand in a bad paper,

278
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,530
<7-16,Leonard>但我如何告诉她这件事
<7-16,Leonard>but how do I tell her it's bad

279
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:42,630
<7-16,Leonard>又不让她知道我已经看了呢
<7-16,Leonard>without letting her know that I read it?

280
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:45,650
<7-17,Sheldon>这难倒我了  现在...
<7-17,Sheldon>Beats me. Now...

281
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,590
<7-17,Sheldon>我知道霍金根本没在忙
<7-17,Sheldon>I know Hawking's not busy

282
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:51,640
<7-17,Sheldon>因为我能看到他在跟其他人玩呢
<7-17,Sheldon>because I can see he's playing other people right now.

283
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,650
<7-18,Leonard>也许你太强了
<7-18,Leonard>Maybe since you're so good,

284
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:56,210
<7-18,Leonard>他得花时间去思考该怎么下
<7-18,Leonard>he's taking his time to meet the challenge.

285
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:57,700
<7-18,Leonard>我希望佩妮能享受在学校...
<7-18,Leonard>I want Penny to enjoy school...

286
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,950
<7-19,Sheldon>沃罗威茨告诉我他是个大孩子
<7-19,Sheldon>Wolowitz told me he's a big baby!

287
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:01,350
<7-19,Sheldon>但我又不知道这事
<7-19,Sheldon>But I didn't know that,

288
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:03,470
<7-19,Sheldon>我连成了"Extract"这个词  得了82分
<7-19,Sheldon>and I played "Extract" for 82 points.

289
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:05,760
<7-19,Sheldon>都是艾米的错  她让我拼这词的
<7-19,Sheldon>It's all Amy's fault. She told me to play it.

290
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,690
<7-19,Sheldon>我得跟她割席断交
<7-19,Sheldon>I have got to cut her loose.

291
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,200
<7-20,Leonard>谢尔顿  我还没说完呢
<7-20,Leonard>Sheldon, I wasn't done talking.

292
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:13,250
<7-20,Leonard>她明天就要交论文了
<7-20,Leonard>She hands in the paper tomorrow.

293
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,180
<7-20,Leonard>我知道我帮得了她
<7-20,Leonard>I know I could help her.

294
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,610
<7-20,Leonard>她是我女朋友...
<7-20,Leonard>And she's my girlfriend...

295
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:18,410
<7-20,Leonard>她  她应该准我帮她
<7-20,Leonard>I-I should be allowed to help her.

296
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:19,850
<7-20,Leonard>为什么就不准我帮她呢
<7-20,Leonard>Why aren't I allowed to help her?

297
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:21,460
<7-21,Sheldon>我懂你的烦恼  兄弟
<7-21,Sheldon>Yeah, I hear you, brother.

321
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,980
<8-5,Leonard>我想问你  听过一个童话叫
<8-5,Leonard>um, are you familiar with the story of

322
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,270
<8-5,Leonard>"精灵和鞋匠"吗
<8-5,Leonard>"The Shoemaker and the Elves"?

<8-6,Penny>精灵吗  拜托  莱纳德
<8-6,Penny>Elves? Come on, Leonard.

<8-7,Leonard>听我说
<8-7,Leonard>Listen, um...

326
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,630
<8-7,Leonard>很久很久以前  有一个鞋匠
<8-7,Leonard>Once upon a time, there was this shoemaker

327
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,450
<8-7,Leonard>他晚上上床睡觉后
<8-7,Leonard>and when he went to bed at night,

328
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:38,830
<8-7,Leonard>精灵们会偷偷地
<8-7,Leonard>elves would sneak in

329
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:42,100
<8-7,Leonard>趁他入睡时  做漂亮的鞋子给他卖
<8-7,Leonard>and they would make all these amazing shoes for him.

330
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:43,930
<8-7,Leonard>当鞋匠第二天一早醒来时
<8-7,Leonard>And when the shoemaker woke up in the morning,

331
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:46,130
<8-7,Leonard>他...他会非常开心
<8-7,Leonard>he-he would be super happy,

332
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:49,140
<8-7,Leonard>一点也不责怪小精灵们
<8-7,Leonard>not mad at the elves at all.

333
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:51,810
<8-7,Leonard>打开吧
<8-7,Leonard>Open it.

334
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:54,030
<8-7,Leonard>好吧
<8-7,Leonard>Okay.

335
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:56,740
<8-8,Penny>1619至1865年  南北战争前
<8-8,Penny>"An examination of the economic, cultural,

337
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:03,090
<8-8,Penny>旧南方地区奴隶制度的根源
<8-8,Penny>in the Old South: 1619 to 1865."

338
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,650
<8-8,Penny>这是什么鬼东西
<8-8,Penny>What the hell is this?

339
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:08,790
<8-9,Leonard>别问我  是一个小精灵做的
<8-9,Leonard>Don't ask me. A little elf did it.

340
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,950
<8-10,Penny>让我理理清楚
<8-10,Penny>So let me get this straight.

341
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:15,180
<8-10,Penny>你没看就猜我的文章会很糟
<8-10,Penny>You just assumed my paper would be bad

342
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,550
<8-10,Penny>所以你写了份新的给我吗
<8-10,Penny>so you wrote one for me?

343
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:18,440
<8-11,Leonard>不  我猜你的文章会很棒  所以我看了
<8-11,Leonard>No, I assumed it would be good. Then I read it.

344
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,340
<8-11,Leonard>-什么  -不是  我...
<8-11,Leonard>- What?! - No, I...

345
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,340
<8-13,Leonard>我是说  的确不错
<8-13,Leonard>I mean, it was good.

346
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:24,610
<8-13,Leonard>只是还有点地方需要稍加润色
<8-13,Leonard>There were just a few things that needed a little polishing.

347
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:27,920
<8-14,Penny>-什么啊  你把每个词都改了  -那不是事实
<8-14,Penny>- W... You changed every word. - That's not true.

348
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,340
<8-15,Leonard>"奴隶制"
<8-15,Leonard>"Slavery."

349
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,470
<8-15,Leonard>"1619年"
<8-15,Leonard>"1619,"

350
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:36,900
<8-15,Leonard>还有上面你的名字  都是你写的呀
<8-15,Leonard>your name at the top-- that's all you.

351
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:39,690
<8-16,Penny>你真是个混蛋
<8-16,Penny>You are such an ass.

352
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:41,190
<8-16,Penny>这就是为何我报读时
<8-16,Penny>This is exactly why I didn't want to tell you

353
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,990
<8-16,Penny>没第一时间告诉你的原因
<8-16,Penny>I was taking a class in the first place.

354
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:44,690
<8-17,Leonard>请别生气  我只是...
<8-17,Leonard>Please don't be upset. I-I just...

355
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:46,930
<8-17,Leonard>我只是不希望你得分太低
<8-17,Leonard>I didn't want you ending up with a bad grade

356
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:48,900
<8-17,Leonard>然后灰心丧气  就不再想
<8-17,Leonard>and get discouraged and give up on the idea

357
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,100
<8-17,Leonard>继续学业了
<8-17,Leonard>of going back to school.

358
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,230
<8-18,Penny>是哦  因为我上学
<8-18,Penny>Right, because me being in school

359
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,730
<8-18,Penny>对你来说太重要了
<8-18,Penny>is so important to you.

360
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,940
<8-18,Penny>这样的话  你约会的对象就不仅仅
<8-18,Penny>That way, you wouldn't have to be dating someone

361
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,310
<8-18,Penny>是个服务员
<8-18,Penny>who's only a waitress.

362
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:58,940
<8-19,Leonard>拜托  你知道我不是这个意思
<8-19,Leonard>Oh, come on, you know that's not true.

363
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,480
<8-20,Penny>是吗  听好了
<8-20,Penny>Do I? Listen to me.

364
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,140
<8-20,Penny>读书这事得靠我自己
<8-20,Penny>I need to do this on my own.

365
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:04,280
<8-20,Penny>挂科就挂科  及格就及格
<8-20,Penny>If I fail, I fail. If I pass, I pass.

366
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,350
<8-20,Penny>你明白了吗
<8-20,Penny>Do you get it?

367
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,070
<8-21,Leonard>抱歉  我只是想帮忙
<8-21,Leonard>I'm sorry. I was just trying to help.

368
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:09,040
<8-22,Penny>下次别帮了
<8-22,Penny>Yeah, well, next time don't.

369
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,020
<8-22,Penny>还有  既然你这么喜欢讲故事
<8-22,Penny>Oh, and since you like stories so much,

370
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:14,150
<8-22,Penny>这不是《鞋匠与精灵》  明白吗
<8-22,Penny>this is not "The Shoemaker and the Elves," okay?

371
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:16,260
<8-22,Penny>这是  "给人一条鱼  他就吃了
<8-22,Penny>This is, "Give a man a fish, he eats it.

372
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,710
<8-22,Penny>教会他捕鱼  他...
<8-22,Penny>Teach a man to fish, he...

373
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,710
<8-22,Penny>会卖鱼什么的"  随便啦  我不知道
<8-22,Penny>sells it or something." Whatever, I don't know!

374
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:22,060
<8-22,Penny>那也比你强多了  你个大混蛋
<8-22,Penny>It's just a lot better than what you did, you big jerk!

375
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:30,090
<9-1,Howard>霍金那边有消息吗
<9-1,Howard>You ever hear back from Hawking?

376
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:31,850
<9-1,Howard>没有
<9-1,Howard>No.

377
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:34,140
<9-2,Sheldon>看来我失去他这朋友了
<9-2,Sheldon>It would appear as if I've lost him.

378
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,130
<9-2,Sheldon>笨大脑
<9-2,Sheldon>Stupid brain.

379
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,440
<9-3,Raj>没事的
<9-3,Raj>It'll be okay.

380
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,210
<9-4,Sheldon>怎么会没事
<9-4,Sheldon>How can it be okay?

381
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:42,860
<9-4,Sheldon>史蒂芬·霍金是天才
<9-4,Sheldon>Stephen Hawking's a genius

382
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,730
<9-4,Sheldon>说话又跟机器人一样
<9-4,Sheldon>and he talks like a robot.

383
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:47,520
<9-4,Sheldon>这可是我理想中的完美朋友
<9-4,Sheldon>It's everything I've ever wanted in a friend.

384
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:50,160
<9-5,Raj>但如果他这人输不起
<9-5,Raj>Yeah, but if he's a sore loser,

385
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,760
<9-5,Raj>没这个朋友也罢
<9-5,Raj>maybe you're better off without him.

386
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,350
<9-5,Raj>有道理
<9-5,Raj>You're right.

387
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:57,260
<9-6,Sheldon>我想我只有尽力把你俩变成柠檬水了
<9-6,Sheldon>I guess I just have to make lemonade out of the two of you.

389
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,540
<9-6,Sheldon>他拼字了  他拼字了
<9-6,Sheldon>He played! He played!

390
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:06,830
<9-6,Sheldon>鸡笼弟和雷霆之轮哥又和好了
<9-6,Sheldon>Coop and Rolling Thunder are together again.

391
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:10,410
<9-6,Sheldon>他对这个绰号没意见
<9-6,Sheldon>He was okay with that nickname.

392
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,490
<9-7,Howard>你现在只要放水让他赢就行了
<9-7,Howard>So, now all you have to do is let him win.

393
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:14,800
<9-8,Sheldon>早想到了
<9-8,Sheldon>Way ahead of you.

394
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,280
<9-8,Sheldon>我会拼"At"[在]
<9-8,Sheldon>I will play the word "At"

395
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,050
<9-8,Sheldon>获得微不足道的两分  输掉比赛
<9-8,Sheldon>for two measly points, throwing the game

396
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:21,560
<9-8,Sheldon>以巩固我和
<9-8,Sheldon>and thus securing my friendship

397
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,550
<9-8,Sheldon>世上最聪明的人的友谊
<9-8,Sheldon>with the smartest man in the world.

398
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:33,200
<9-9,Howard>你等什么呢  提交答案啊
<9-9,Howard>What are you waiting for? Hit "Send."

399
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,470
<9-9,Howard>下不了手
<9-9,Howard>I can't.

400
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,190
<9-10,Sheldon>故意放水是智慧上的欺诈
<9-10,Sheldon>Losing on purpose is intellectually dishonest.

401
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,130
<9-13,Howard>那就别这样
<9-13,Howard>So don't do it.

402
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:40,040
<9-12,Sheldon>可我想做霍金的朋友
<9-12,Sheldon>Oh, but I want to be Hawking's friend.

403
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,340
<9-13,Howard>那就快发啊
<9-13,Howard>So do it.

404
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,280
<9-14,Sheldon>但如果这样做  我就是个伪君子
<9-14,Sheldon>No, but if I do, I'll be a phony,

405
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,410
<9-14,Sheldon>没节操
<9-14,Sheldon>a sellout,

406
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:46,170
<9-14,Sheldon>像好莱坞明星一样假
<9-14,Sheldon>a Hollywood poser.

407
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:49,350
<9-15,Raj>那就别这样做
<9-15,Raj>Then don't do it.

408
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,460
<9-15,Raj>我不会
<9-15,Raj>I won't.

409
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,950
<9-16,Sheldon>这样感觉才对
<9-16,Sheldon>This feels right.

410
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:55,810
<9-16,Sheldon>我妈总是说  对自己要诚实
<9-16,Sheldon>My mother always said, "to thine own self be true."

411
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:56,920
<9-17,Howard>好样的
<9-17,Howard>Good for you.

412
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,630
<9-18,Sheldon>她也告诉我全世界的动物
<9-18,Sheldon>'Course she also told me that every animal in the world

413
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:01,710
<9-18,Sheldon>上了一条船  她懂什么呀  发送
<9-18,Sheldon>got on one boat, so what does she know? And send.

415
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:10,200
<10-1,Leonard>几天没见到你了
<10-1,Leonard>Haven't heard from you in a couple days.

416
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:11,210
<10-1,Leonard>你还在生我的气吗
<10-1,Leonard>You still mad at me?

417
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:12,440
<10-2,Penny>没
<10-2,Penny>Nope.

418
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,510
<10-2,Penny>我没有理由
<10-2,Penny>I have no reason to...

419
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,470
<10-2,Penny>生你的气[谐音be mad at you]
<10-2,Penny>"B" mad at you.

421
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,650
<10-4,Penny>没错  我的论文
<10-4,Penny>That's right. On my paper.

422
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:26,380
<10-4,Penny>不是你的  是我的得了B-  你这个混蛋精灵
<10-4,Penny>Not yours, mine, you punk-ass elf.

423
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,390
<10-5,Leonard>我不知道说什么好
<10-5,Leonard>I don't know what to say.

424
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:31,840
<10-6,Penny>这样说
<10-6,Penny>Hmm, how about,

425
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,610
<10-6,Penny>"老天  佩妮  你比我想象中要聪明
<10-6,Penny>"Gee, Penny, you're smarter than I thought.

426
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:36,240
<10-6,Penny>虽说上学的是你
<10-6,Penny>You may be the one in school,

427
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,330
<10-6,Penny>但学到一课的是我
<10-6,Penny>but I'm the one who learned a lesson.

428
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:42,100
<10-6,Penny>我好蠢  佩妮  真滴"
<10-6,Penny>I'm so stupid, Penny. Duh..."

429
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:50,140
<10-7,Sheldon>她学你学得惟妙惟肖啊
<10-7,Sheldon>She sounds exactly like you!

430
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:54,250
<11-1,Amy>莱纳德有啥反应
<11-1,Amy>How'd it go with Leonard?

431
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:57,350
<11-2,Penny>我想他不会再犯这种错误了
<11-2,Penny>I don't think he'll be making that mistake again.

432
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:58,390
<11-3,Bernadette>太好了
<11-3,Bernadette>Good.

433
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:00,450
<11-4,Penny>我知道我这是多此一举
<11-4,Penny>So, I know this goes without saying,

434
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:01,820
<11-4,Penny>但如果你们告诉莱纳德
<11-4,Penny>but if either of you tell Leonard

435
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,020
<11-4,Penny>你们帮我重写了论文
<11-4,Penny>you helped me rewrite this paper,

436
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:05,270
<11-4,Penny>我会用一袋橙子打爆你们俩
<11-4,Penny>I will beat you both with a bag of oranges.

437
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:08,010
<11-6,Bernadette>-知道  -明白
<11-6,Bernadette>- Got it. - Understood.

438
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:10,650
<11-7,Penny>姐妹们  这次论文得了B-
<11-7,Penny>Now, ladies, we got a B-minus on this paper.

439
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,300
<11-7,Penny>我认为如果我们一起努力
<11-7,Penny>I think if we put our heads together,

440
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,570
<11-7,Penny>下次就会得个A
<11-7,Penny>on the next one we could get an "A."

441
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,540
<11-8,Bernadette>可我们是故意让你得B-的  这样才可信
<11-8,Bernadette>Uh, but we got you a B-minus on purpose to make it believable.

442
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:18,740
<11-9,Penny>可信
<11-9,Penny>Believable?

443
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:21,280
<11-9,Penny>你是说我不聪明吗
<11-9,Penny>You saying I'm not smart?

444
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,740
<11-10,Bernadette>-不是  -你很聪明
<11-10,Bernadette>- No, no! - You're smart.

445
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:26,290
<11-12,Penny>这还差不多
<11-12,Penny>That's better.

446
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:30,160
<11-13,Amy>感觉我又回到了高中
<11-13,Amy>I feel like I'm in high school again.

447
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,100
<11-14,Bernadette>对  帮舞会皇后做功课  这样她才喜欢我们
<11-14,Bernadette>Yeah, doing the prom queen's homework so she'll like us.

448
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:36,000
<11-15,Amy>是啊
<11-15,Amy>I know.

449
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:38,650
<11-15,Amy>这招终于管用了
<11-15,Amy>It's finally working.

450
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:51,400
<12-1,Sheldon>是史蒂芬·霍金
<12-1,Sheldon>It's Stephen Hawking.

451

<12-2,Leonard>快接  我想听
<12-2,Leonard>Answer it. I want to hear.

452

<12-3,Sheldon>霍金教授
<12-3,Sheldon>Professor Hawking,

453
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,570
<12-3,Sheldon>很高兴你打电话过来
<12-3,Sheldon>how nice of you to call.

<12-4,Stephen Hawking>I really enjoyed our game, Dr. Cooper.

456
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:06,280
<12-5,Sheldon>我也是
<12-5,Sheldon>Oh, me, too.

457
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,110
<12-6,Stephen Hawking>还是该叫你窝囊废博士呢
<12-6,Stephen Hawking>Or should I say Dr. Loser?

458
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,750
<12-6,Stephen Hawking>哈哈哈
<12-6,Stephen Hawking>Ha, ha, ha.

459
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,540
<12-7,Sheldon>是的  恭喜你
<12-7,Sheldon>Yes, congratulations.

460
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:20,510
<12-7,Sheldon>你是实至名归的赢家
<12-7,Sheldon>You won fair and square.

461
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,600
<12-7,Sheldon>非常厉害  先生
<12-7,Sheldon>Uh, very impressive, sir.

462
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,580
<12-8,Stephen Hawking>你喜欢"脑筋急转弯"吗
<12-8,Stephen Hawking>Do you like brain teasers?

463
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:27,400
<12-9,Sheldon>我爱玩"脑筋急转弯"
<12-9,Sheldon>Oh, I love brain teasers.

464
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,370
<12-10,Stephen Hawking>谢尔顿·库珀
<12-10,Stephen Hawking>What does Sheldon Cooper

465
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:32,750
<12-10,Stephen Hawking>与黑洞有什么共同点
<12-10,Stephen Hawking>and a black hole have in common?

466
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,930
<12-10,Stephen Hawking>都很烂[吸力]
<12-10,Stephen Hawking>They both suck.

467
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:44,270
<12-10,Stephen Hawking>气死你  气死你
<12-10,Stephen Hawking>Neener neener.
