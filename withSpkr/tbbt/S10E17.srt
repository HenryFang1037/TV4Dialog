20
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,010
<1-1,Sheldon>有意思
<1-1,Sheldon>Interesting.

21
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,890
<1-1,Sheldon>好的
<1-1,Sheldon>Okay.

22
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:59,010
<1-2,Raj>多糟糕
<1-2,Raj>How bad is it?

23
00:00:59,010 --> 00:00:59,880
<1-3,Sheldon>我这么说吧
<1-3,Sheldon>Let me put it this way--

24
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:04,600
<1-3,Sheldon>你有三尺白绫跟板凳吗
<1-3,Sheldon>do you own a barrel and suspenders?

25
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,770
<1-4,Raj>你是说认真的吗
<1-4,Raj>Are you serious?

26
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:09,440
<1-5,Sheldon>我戴这个遮光帽可不是为了打女子高尔夫
<1-5,Sheldon>I'm not wearing this visor to play women's golf.

27
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,960
<1-5,Sheldon>绿色遮光帽是19世纪晚期到20世纪中期
<1-5,Sheldon>会计审计员等都会戴来遮挡早期白炽灯光线

28
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:12,910
<1-7,Leonard>我猜猜
<1-7,Leonard>Oh, let me guess.

29
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:17,550
<1-8,Penny>你们在玩梦幻会计公司
<1-8,Penny>You guys are drafting your fantasy accounting firms.

31
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,580
<1-9,Leonard>我们在帮忙拉杰整理财务状况
<1-9,Leonard>We're helping Raj figure out his finances.

32
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,620
<1-10,Penny>他有工作收入  情况能有多差
<1-10,Penny>Well, he has a job. How bad can it be?

33
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:24,300
<1-11,Sheldon>他的房租与汽车租贷费用极其高
<1-11,Sheldon>Well, his rent and car lease are exceedingly high.

34
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,870
<1-11,Sheldon>再加上他喜欢上馆子吃饭与购物
<1-11,Sheldon>You couple that with his penchant for dining out and shopping...

35
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:28,560
<1-12,Penny>等等  购物不是指买衣服对吧
<1-12,Penny>Wait, wait, not shopping for clothes, right?

36
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,070
<1-12,Penny>看他这打扮...
<1-12,Penny>Because look.

37
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:34,570
<1-13,Sheldon>而且他的信用卡债务数额惊人
<1-13,Sheldon>He also has a remarkable amount of credit card debt.

38
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:36,750
<1-14,Howard>不是你爹帮你付的信用卡账单吗
<1-14,Howard>I thought your dad paid your cards.

39
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,650
<1-15,Raj>我有一张自己付款的紧急备用卡
<1-15,Raj>I have a card for emergencies that I pay for myself.

40
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:41,930
<1-16,Sheldon>在洛城动物园发生了什么紧急事故
<1-16,Sheldon>What emergency happened at the L.A. Zoo?

41
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:44,700
<1-17,Raj>我认养了一只企鹅
<1-17,Raj>That's a penguin I sponsor.

42
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:47,020
<1-17,Raj>它们因为全球暖化而失去了家园
<1-17,Raj>They're losing their homes to global warming,

43
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,820
<1-17,Raj>而我的车每三公里耗一升油
<1-17,Raj>and my car gets, like, seven miles a gallon,

44
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:51,130
<1-17,Raj>我挺过意不去
<1-17,Raj>so I felt bad.

45
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:53,170
<1-18,Leonard>这粉嫩双颊[屁股]是啥
<1-18,Leonard>What is Pink Cheeks?

46
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:56,470
<1-19,Raj>是私密处除毛  那张不许看
<1-19,Raj>It's intimate waxing. Quit looking at that!

47
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,270
<1-20,Leonard>或许你该找个人
<1-20,Leonard>Maybe you should find someone

48
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:01,650
<1-20,Leonard>来帮忙让你财务状况回到正轨
<1-20,Leonard>to help you get your finances under control.

49
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:02,780
<1-21,Raj>比如理财经理吗
<1-21,Raj>Like a business manager?

50
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,310
<1-22,Sheldon>不  当然不行
<1-22,Sheldon>No, absolutely not.

51
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,760
<1-22,Sheldon>你请不起一名
<1-22,Sheldon>You can't afford to hire someone

52
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,620
<1-22,Sheldon>会禁止你花钱在白痴开销上的人
<1-22,Sheldon>who'll forbid you from spending your money on foolish expenses.

53
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:11,750
<1-22,Sheldon>因为那也是白痴开销  而我禁止你这么做
<1-22,Sheldon>That is a foolish expense, and I forbid it.

54
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,420
<1-23,Howard>那如果有一个单纯只是喜欢控制别人
<1-23,Howard>What if there's someone who just likes controlling

55
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:19,870
<1-23,Howard>而且乐于将别人生活中的欢乐偷走的人呢
<1-23,Howard>other people and stealing joy from their lives?

56
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:22,870
<1-24,Sheldon>他听起来像个反社会变态啊
<1-24,Sheldon>He sounds like a sociopath.

57
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:26,920
<1-25,Leonard>我们也不确定  他妈妈没带他去检查过这个
<1-25,Leonard>We don't know, his mother never had him tested.

58
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:32,130
<1-26,Sheldon>你们说的是我  真好笑
<1-26,Sheldon>You're talking about me. Very funny.

59
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:36,080
<1-26,Sheldon>虽然我的确是会享受安排好预算
<1-26,Sheldon>Although I would enjoy drawing up a budget

60
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,930
<1-26,Sheldon>然后逼拉杰坚持计划
<1-26,Sheldon>and forcing Raj to adhere to it

61
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:39,380
<1-26,Sheldon>而且丝毫不带任何同情心
<1-26,Sheldon>without an ounce of compassion.

62
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:42,820
<1-27,Penny>等等  那谁去跟企鹅说金援要断了
<1-27,Penny>Wait, wait, who's gonna break it to the penguin?

63
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:45,380
<1-28,Raj>行啊  谢尔顿
<1-28,Raj>Okay, Sheldon.

64
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:47,310
<1-28,Raj>我的财务就交给你管吧
<1-28,Raj>Yeah, I'm putting you in charge of my finances.

65
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:50,140
<1-28,Raj>我再也不会花任何一分未经你批准的钱
<1-28,Raj>I will not spend another penny that you don't authorize.

66
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,240
<1-28,Raj>非常好
<1-28,Raj>Very well.

67
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,670
<1-29,Sheldon>漫展的票这周五开卖
<1-29,Sheldon>Hey, Comic-Con tickets go on sale this Friday.

68
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,650
<1-29,Sheldon>你不许买
<1-29,Sheldon>You can't buy one.

69
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:00,280
<1-30,Howard>祝你下次好运啦  粉嫩双颊
<1-30,Howard>Oh, better luck next time, Pink Cheeks.

81
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:29,040
<2-1,Amy>你真的要去漫展吗
<2-1,Amy>You're actually going to Comic-Con?

82
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,080
<2-2,Penny>莱纳德希望我多陪他做这方面的事
<2-2,Penny>Well, Leonard wants me to do more stuff like that with him,

83
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,060
<2-2,Penny>我就想要不今年陪他去
<2-2,Penny>so I thought maybe this year I'd tag along.

84
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,140
<2-3,Amy>真好  我猜你一定会玩得很开心
<2-3,Amy>Well, that's sweet. I bet you'll have fun.

85
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,640
<2-4,Penny>那你要一起来吗
<2-4,Penny>So, do you want to come?

86
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:37,610
<2-5,Amy>谢邀  不用了
<2-5,Amy>No, thanks.

87
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:41,180
<2-5,Amy>我已经住在一个所有阿宅都会来的家了
<2-5,Amy>I already live in a place all the nerds come to.

88
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,290
<2-6,Penny>求你啦  我上个月也陪你参加无聊活动了啊
<2-6,Penny>Please? I went to your boring thing last month.

89
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:48,420
<2-7,Amy>你是说我阿姨的葬礼吗
<2-7,Amy>My aunt's funeral?

90
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:52,540
<2-8,Penny>干嘛啊  你自己也在听悼词时看邮箱了
<2-8,Penny>Come on, even you checked your e-mail during the eulogy.

91
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,110
<2-8,Penny>我才不要去
<2-8,Penny>Well, I'm not going,

92
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:56,650
<2-9,Amy>但我觉得你想去挺好的
<2-9,Amy>but I do think it's nice you want to.

93
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:58,070
<2-10,Penny>不是我想去好吗
<2-10,Penny>It's not that I want to go,

94
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:59,800
<2-10,Penny>我只是想哄莱纳德高兴
<2-10,Penny>I just think it'll make Leonard happy.

95
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,810
<2-10,Penny>如果哄他就得看他挤进伊渥克服
<2-10,Penny>And if I have to watch him squeeze into an Ewok costume,

97
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:04,210
<2-10,Penny>那我也忍了
<2-10,Penny>so be it.

98
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:06,210
<2-11,Amy>看看你  要去漫展
<2-11,Amy>Look at you, going to Comic-Con,

99
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:07,350
<2-11,Amy>还聊起了伊渥克族
<2-11,Amy>talking about Ewoks.

100
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:10,490
<2-11,Amy>我真变成了我们这群里最酷的那个人了
<2-11,Amy>I really have become the cool one around here.

101
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,280
<3-1,Howard>你真认为佩妮会在漫展玩得开心吗
<3-1,Howard>You actually think Penny will have fun at Comic-Con?

102
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,950
<3-2,Leonard>不觉得  所以这会让我很郁闷
<3-2,Leonard>No. Which will make me miserable,

103
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:20,600
<3-2,Leonard>而通常让我郁闷是谢尔顿的专利
<3-2,Leonard>which is usually Sheldon's job.

104
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:24,380
<3-3,Sheldon>她一定会很不爽排队等明星座谈会
<3-3,Sheldon>She's gonna hate waiting in line for the panels.

105
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,900
<3-4,Howard>她一定会很不爽去听座谈会的阿宅
<3-4,Howard>She's gonna hate all the crowds at the panels.

106
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,090
<3-5,Sheldon>她一定会很不爽那些座谈会
<3-5,Sheldon>She's gonna hate the panels.

107
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,580
<3-6,Leonard>她一定会很不爽我们说"座谈会"这词的频率
<3-6,Leonard>She's gonna hate how often we say the word "Panels."

108
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,170
<3-7,Howard>那你干嘛不叫她别来了
<3-7,Howard>Why don't you just tell her not to come?

109
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:36,690
<3-8,Leonard>她感觉超有兴致  我不想这么狠心
<3-8,Leonard>Well, she's so excited, I can't do that to her.

110
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:38,470
<3-9,Howard>那你何不把漫展说得一文不值
<3-9,Howard>What if you make it sound so bad

111
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:40,260
<3-9,Howard>她就自己不会想去啦
<3-9,Howard>she won't want to go?

112
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,950
<3-10,Leonard>那我倒是可以狠心试试
<3-10,Leonard>That I would do to her.

113
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,330
<3-11,Raj>真不敢相信佩妮都去了
<3-11,Raj>I can't believe Penny's gonna get to go,

114
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:46,510
<3-11,Raj>而我却不能去
<3-11,Raj>and I'm not.

115
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,570
<3-12,Sheldon>反正你可以在网上看明星座谈会嘛
<3-12,Sheldon>You can always watch the panels online.

116
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:51,830
<3-12,Sheldon>天啊  我们还真是总说"座谈会"
<3-12,Sheldon>Oh, boy, we do say that a lot.

117
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:54,450
<3-12,Sheldon>座谈会
<3-12,Sheldon>Panels.

118
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,310
<3-13,Stuart>我就想加入一下大家
<3-13,Stuart>Just wanted to be included.

119
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,850
<3-13,Stuart>求你了  谢尔顿  这可是漫展
<3-13,Stuart>Come on, Sheldon, it's Comic-Con.

120
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,060
<3-14,Sheldon>让我花钱去参加吧
<3-14,Sheldon>Just let me have the money for this,

121
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,520
<3-14,Sheldon>我保证不会乱花钱干别的
<3-14,Sheldon>and I won't ask for anything else.

122
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,600
<3-14,Sheldon>是你让我来管着你的账
<3-14,Sheldon>You put me in charge of your finances.

123
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,030
<3-14,Sheldon>如果你想要心软没骨气  让你颐指气使的人
<3-14,Sheldon>If you wanted someone weak and spineless you could walk all over,

124
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:13,640
<3-14,Sheldon>你当初就该去找莱纳德来管
<3-14,Sheldon>you should have asked Leonard.

125
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,070
<3-15,Leonard>你看  郁闷吧
<3-15,Leonard>See? Miserable.

126
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:18,910
<3-16,Raj>行  你说得没错  是我自作自受
<3-16,Raj>Okay, you're right, I got myself into this,

127
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:20,880
<3-16,Raj>但每年都是我们四个一起去参加漫展的啊
<3-16,Raj>but I've never missed a Comic-Con with you guys.

128
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,070
<3-17,Sheldon>你老爸愿意宠溺你  但我可以不会
<3-17,Sheldon>Your father may have spoiled you, but I won't.

129
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,560
<3-17,Sheldon>如果你想要去动漫展的票
<3-17,Sheldon>If you want a ticket to Comic-Con,

130
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,930
<3-17,Sheldon>那我建议你想办法去挣点外快
<3-17,Sheldon>I suggest you figure out a way to earn the money yourself.

131
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:29,650
<3-18,Howard>你是个受过高度教育的成人
<3-18,Howard>Yeah, you're a grown man who's highly educated.

132
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:33,590
<3-18,Howard>你可以收钱当人肉沙包啊
<3-18,Howard>You could charge people money to punch you.

133
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,900
<3-19,Raj>随你嘲讽  我不知道你哪来的自信
<3-19,Raj>Go ahead, make jokes. I don't know why you think

134
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,480
<3-19,Raj>觉得自己就去得成漫展  你家小孩刚出生
<3-19,Raj>you're going to Comic-Con-- you just had a baby.

135
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,810
<3-20,Howard>-所以呢  -还所以呢
<3-20,Howard>- So? - Well, so?

136
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:42,510
<3-21,Raj>所以你觉得伯纳黛特会轻松答应
<3-21,Raj>So you think Bernadette's just gonna let you

137
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,610
<3-21,Raj>让你飞去圣地亚哥五天
<3-21,Raj>jet down to San Diego for five days

138
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,180
<3-21,Raj>然后把她孤零零丢在家吗
<3-21,Raj>and leave her alone?

139
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,110
<3-22,Leonard>稍等一下
<3-22,Leonard>Hang-hang on.

140
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:49,720
<3-22,Leonard>所以我得带着佩妮  而你付不起票
<3-22,Leonard>So I have to bring Penny, you can't afford it,

141
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,810
<3-22,Leonard>霍华德去就死定了
<3-22,Leonard>Howard's gonna get in trouble,

142
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:53,390
<3-22,Leonard>唯独这家伙可以好好享受漫展
<3-22,Leonard>and this guy gets to have a great time.

143
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:57,340
<3-23,Sheldon>我要打扮成邓布利多去
<3-23,Sheldon>I'm gonna go as Dumbledore.

145
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:03,020
<4-1,Howard>我亲爱的小美人好吗
<4-1,Howard>How's my favorite girl?

146
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,410
<4-2,Bernadette>还可以啊
<4-2,Bernadette>Okay.

147
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:06,490
<4-3,Howard>-你在干嘛呢  -做千层面
<4-3,Howard>- What you doing? - Making lasagna.

148
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:09,430
<4-5,Howard>这妞出得了厅堂  又入得了厨房
<4-5,Howard>Oh, she's sexy, she can cook.

149
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,200
<4-5,Howard>我真是走了大运
<4-5,Howard>I'm such a lucky guy.

150
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,140
<4-6,Bernadette>你想买傻逼东西了  还是你做傻逼事了
<4-6,Bernadette>You want something stupid, or you did something stupid?

151
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:19,020
<4-7,Howard>才不是  我只是走进来  看到闭月羞花的你
<4-7,Howard>No. I just walked in here, saw how beautiful you are

152
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,310
<4-7,Howard>情不自禁就想说出口
<4-7,Howard>and had to tell you.

153
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:23,800
<4-8,Bernadette>天啊  你是不是背着我跟拉杰搞基了
<4-8,Bernadette>Oh, dear God, you're cheating on me with Raj.

154
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,430
<4-9,Howard>这笑话真是永不过时
<4-9,Howard>Never gets old.

155
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,270
<4-9,Howard>好啦  我的确想要个东西
<4-9,Howard>Okay, there is something I want,

156
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:33,590
<4-9,Howard>不过不是什么大事
<4-9,Howard>but it's not a big deal.

157
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:34,570
<4-10,Bernadette>什么东西
<4-10,Bernadette>What is it?

158
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:36,340
<4-10,Bernadette>漫展的票这周五开卖
<4-10,Bernadette>Well, Comic-Con tickets go on sale this Friday,

159
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,620
<4-11,Howard>我希望能跟其他几个一起去
<4-11,Howard>and I was hoping I could go with the guys.

160
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,860
<4-11,Howard>但在你回答之前  我会对我的离开做出补偿
<4-11,Howard>But before you say anything, I'll make up for being gone

161
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,500
<4-11,Howard>家里一切活我全包  做什么都行
<4-11,Howard>by doing everything around here-- I mean everything.

162
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,830
<4-11,Howard>连帮你回答这个问题都行
<4-11,Howard>I'm even gonna answer for you.

163
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:46,770
<4-11,Howard>"准了  霍华德  准你去"
<4-11,Howard>"Yes, Howard, you can go."

164
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,440
<4-12,Bernadette>拒绝你真是太难了
<4-12,Bernadette>It's so hard to say no to you.

165
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,730
<4-13,Howard>谢谢你
<4-13,Howard>Thank you.

166
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:53,730
<4-14,Bernadette>所以或许吧
<4-14,Bernadette>So I'll say maybe.

167
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,520
<4-15,Howard>什么  为什么
<4-15,Howard>What? Why?

168
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,250
<4-16,Bernadette>你自己说票周五才开卖对吧
<4-16,Bernadette>You said tickets don't go on sale till Friday, right?

169
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,290
<4-17,Howard>对啊
<4-17,Howard>Yeah.

170
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:03,100
<4-18,Bernadette>你也说家里一切活你全包对吧
<4-18,Bernadette>You said you were gonna do all this stuff for me, right?

171
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,380
<4-17,Howard>对啊
<4-17,Howard>Yeah.

172
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,770
<4-20,Bernadette>听出我接下来要说什么了吗
<4-20,Bernadette>See where I'm going with this?

173
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:13,830
<4-17,Howard>听出来了
<4-17,Howard>Yeah.

174
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,710
<4-22,Bernadette>如果你不知道怎么做千层面  就去问谷歌
<4-22,Bernadette>If you don't know how to make lasagna, Google does.

175
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:25,580
<5-1,Leonard>好的  所以这是动漫展主层
<5-1,Leonard>Okay, so this is the main Comic-Con floor.

176
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:28,160
<5-1,Leonard>所有的小贩和展览都在这里
<5-1,Leonard>It's where all the vendors and exhibits are.

177
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,820
<5-2,Penny>好多人挤在这里面啊
<5-2,Penny>Wow, that is a lot of people jammed in there.

178
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,970
<5-3,Leonard>有时候霍华德会穿条纹衫
<5-3,Leonard>I know. Sometimes Howard wears a striped shirt

179
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:37,190
<5-3,Leonard>这样我们就能玩"霍华德在哪里"
<5-3,Leonard>so we can play "Where's Wolowitz?"

180
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:37,190
<5-3,Leonard>知名游戏童书《威利在哪里》  就是在人海中
<5-3,Leonard>找出身穿红白条纹衫与绒球帽的男主人翁

181
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,270
<5-3,Leonard>这是我们餐风露宿排队
<5-3,Leonard>Okay, now, th-this is us camping out in line

182
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,730
<5-3,Leonard>等去看《复仇者联盟》座谈会
<5-3,Leonard>for the Avengers panel.

183
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,820
<5-4,Penny>你们还真睡在人行道上呢
<5-4,Penny>Oh, you really sleep on the sidewalk, huh?

184
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,930
<5-5,Leonard>对啊  入夜有时挺冷
<5-5,Leonard>Yeah. It can get chilly,

185
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:51,410
<5-5,Leonard>但拉杰想出  如果我们尿在瓶子里
<5-5,Leonard>but Raj figured out that if you pee in a bottle

186
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:52,340
<5-5,Leonard>然后放进睡袋中
<5-5,Leonard>and put it in your sleeping bag,

187
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:55,240
<5-5,Leonard>能有类似热水袋的作用
<5-5,Leonard>it helps keep you warm.

188
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,640
<5-5,Leonard>这是我们一起住的酒店房间
<5-5,Leonard>Here's the hotel room we all share.

189
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,050
<5-6,Penny>到时候我们会单独订一房间的吧
<5-6,Penny>Well, you and I would get our own room, right?

190
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,940
<5-7,Leonard>所有酒店都订满了
<5-7,Leonard>Every hotel is booked.

191
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,890
<5-7,Leonard>不过你看这一块
<5-7,Leonard>But, yeah, see this space here

192
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:06,370
<5-7,Leonard>就是我脑袋跟谢尔顿脚底之间的空间
<5-7,Leonard>between Sheldon's feet and my head?

193
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:09,010
<5-7,Leonard>到时候你就睡这
<5-7,Leonard>That's where you go.

194
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:10,650
<5-8,Penny>这跟以前打雷的时候谢尔顿
<5-8,Penny>Well, it's no different than when Sheldon

195
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:14,830
<5-8,Penny>爬上我们床来跟我们挤没什么两样
<5-8,Penny>used to climb in bed with us during a thunderstorm.

196
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:17,390
<5-9,Leonard>不用担心  反正到时候也不太会睡觉
<5-9,Leonard>Don't worry, we won't be doing much sleeping anyway.

197
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,870
<5-9,Leonard>那里就像个彻夜狂欢派对
<5-9,Leonard>It's like an all-night party.

198
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:22,730
<5-9,Leonard>有冷知识竞赛与《龙与地下城》桌游
<5-9,Leonard>There's trivia contests and Dungeons & Dragons.

199
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:26,890
<5-9,Leonard>按我们的话说  就是"乐子[锁子甲]超多"
<5-9,Leonard>As we like to say, it's "Off the chain mail."

200
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:29,710
<6-1,Leonard>我甚至说了"乐子[锁子甲]超多"
<6-1,Leonard>I even said "Off the chain mail,"

201
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:32,530
<6-1,Leonard>她还是没打退堂鼓
<6-1,Leonard>and she still wants to go.

202
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:34,390
<6-2,Sheldon>或许这事赖我
<6-2,Sheldon>That's probably my fault.

203
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:37,970
<6-2,Sheldon>可能她耳闻了我的超屌邓布利多变装
<6-2,Sheldon>She may have heard about my cool Dumbledore costume.

204
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:41,430
<6-3,Stuart>行吧  整盒算你20块
<6-3,Stuart>Okay, I can give you 20 bucks for the whole box.

205
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:44,060
<6-4,Raj>这些东西你以前要我几百块呢
<6-4,Raj>But you charged me hundreds for this stuff.

206
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:47,750
<6-5,Stuart>对啊  而且我都不带眨眼的
<6-5,Stuart>I know. And I did it with a straight face.

207
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,240
<6-6,Raj>但我需要挣够足够的钱
<6-6,Raj>But I need to earn enough money

208
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,520
<6-6,Raj>我才能去漫展
<6-6,Raj>so I can go to Comic-Con.

209
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,670
<6-7,Stuart>好吧
<6-7,Stuart>Well... all right.

210
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,630
<6-7,Stuart>我给你25块
<6-7,Stuart>I'll give you 25 bucks.

211
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:59,610
<6-7,Stuart>我最高就出这么多
<6-7,Stuart>That's my best offer.

212
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:01,230
<6-8,Raj>我也别无选择了
<6-8,Raj>I have no choice.

213
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,740
<6-9,Stuart>如果你想挣外快
<6-9,Stuart>You know, if you want to make extra money,

214
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,430
<6-9,Stuart>我可以给你点活儿啊
<6-9,Stuart>I-I could throw some work your way.

215
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:05,520
<6-10,Raj>真的吗  我什么活儿都愿意做
<6-10,Raj>Really? I'll do anything.

216
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,560
<6-11,Stuart>很好  你被录用了
<6-11,Stuart>Great, you're hired.

217
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,740
<6-11,Stuart>先从把这些东西贴上价钱开始
<6-11,Stuart>First thing you can do is put price tags on these.

218
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:11,920
<6-11,Stuart>小的那些先贴50块
<6-11,Stuart>Start the little ones at $50.

219
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,470
<7-1,Penny>也没什么
<7-1,Penny>You know, it's no big deal.

220
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:17,650
<7-1,Penny>反正三天而已  我什么都能忍得住
<7-1,Penny>I can put up with anything for three days.

221
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:18,780
<7-2,Amy>漫展是五天
<7-2,Amy>Comic-Con's five days.

222
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:21,310
<7-3,Penny>你耍我吧
<7-3,Penny>Are you kidding me?

223
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,730
<7-4,Amy>你为什么不告诉他你不想去
<7-4,Amy>Why don't you just tell him you don't want to go?

224
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,790
<7-5,Penny>不行  我不想伤他的心
<7-5,Penny>I can't, it'll break his heart.

225
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:27,850
<7-5,Penny>他总是很努力尝试做那些
<7-5,Penny>You know, he's always making an effort

226
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:29,720
<7-5,Penny>他不喜欢的事来陪我
<7-5,Penny>to do things with me he doesn't enjoy,

227
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,310
<7-5,Penny>比如出门
<7-5,Penny>like going outside.

228
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,120
<7-6,Amy>他的确是室内猫类型
<7-6,Amy>He is an indoor cat.

229
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:37,110
<7-7,Penny>或许没想象中那么糟啊
<7-7,Penny>You know, maybe it won't be that bad.

230
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,220
<7-7,Penny>莱纳德说现在宅文化已经是主流文化
<7-7,Penny>Leonard says it's really mainstream now.

231
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:42,680
<7-7,Penny>漫画不只是给可悲的阿宅看的了
<7-7,Penny>Comic books aren't just for sad nerds anymore.

232
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:01,090
<7-7,Penny>显然可悲的阿宅在他们族群仍占多数
<7-7,Penny>I mean, it is still a key part of their demographic.

233
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,810
<8-1,Bernadette (off)>华仔  你能开下门吗
<8-1,Bernadette (off)>Howie, can you get that?

234
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,790
<8-2,Howard (off)>我在忙
<8-2,Howard (off)>Kind of busy.

235
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:13,490
<8-3,Bernadette (off)>有你去圣地亚哥玩耍
<8-3,Bernadette (off)>Busy like I'll be with the baby

236
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:16,190
<8-3,Bernadette (off)>而我在家苦逼带孩子时那么忙吗
<8-3,Bernadette (off)>if you go to San Diego?

237
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,360
<8-5,Raj>这手套是怎么回事
<8-5,Raj>What's with the gloves?

238
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,450
<8-6,Howard>跟我这身衣服配套的  有何贵干
<8-6,Howard>They complete my ensemble. What do you want?

239
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,020
<8-7,Raj>我想挣点外快
<8-7,Raj>I'm looking to make extra money

240
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:30,600
<8-7,Raj>来看看你有没有什么杂活给我干
<8-7,Raj>and was wondering if you had any chores I could do.

241
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,890
<8-8,Howard>稍等
<8-8,Howard>Hang on.

242
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:37,380
<8-8,Howard>妮妮  我可以把我的家务活外包给一个印度人吗
<8-8,Howard>Bernie, can I outsource my chores to an Indian guy?

243
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,590
<8-9,Bernadette>不行
<8-9,Bernadette>No.

244
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:42,830
<8-10,Howard>我尽力了
<8-10,Howard>I tried.

245
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:46,820
<9-1,Leonard>我在考虑
<9-1,Leonard>Hey, I was thinking,

246
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,880
<9-1,Leonard>如果你想穿情侣装
<9-1,Leonard>if you want to do a couples costume,

247
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,720
<9-1,Leonard>我们可以把自己刷成绿色  扮成绿巨人和女绿巨人
<9-1,Leonard>we could paint ourselves green and be Hulk and She-Hulk.

248
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,760
<9-1,Leonard>又或者我们可以把自己刷成蓝色
<9-1,Leonard>Or we could paint ourselves blue

249
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,870
<9-1,Leonard>扮成夜行者和变形女
<9-1,Leonard>and go as Nightcrawler and Mystique.

250
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:00,950
<9-2,Penny>有没有不用全身刷漆的方案
<9-2,Penny>Is there any scenario where we're not in full body paint?

251
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:04,270
<9-3,Leonard>有啊  如果你想我们看起来逊爆了的话
<9-3,Leonard>Yeah, if you want us to look like losers.

252
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:07,460
<9-4,Penny>你确定其他三人不介意我也一起去吗
<9-4,Penny>Hey, um, are you sure the guys are okay with me coming?

253
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,510
<9-5,Leonard>当然啦  为什么这么问
<9-5,Leonard>Yeah, of course, why?

254
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,430
<9-6,Penny>就是通常都是你们四个一起去
<9-6,Penny>This is just something you usually do together,

255
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:13,970
<9-6,Penny>如果我去会破坏气氛  我也不是非得去
<9-6,Penny>and if I'm screwing it up, I don't have to go.

256
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:18,300
<9-7,Leonard>怎么了  你不想去吗
<9-7,Leonard>Oh, why? Do you not want to go?

257
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:22,260
<9-8,Penny>怎么了  你不想我去吗
<9-8,Penny>Why? Do you not want me to go?

258
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:25,230
<9-9,Leonard>不  我当然想你去
<9-9,Leonard>No, I want you to go.

259
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:31,400
<9-10,Penny>那就好  因为我也想去
<9-10,Penny>Okay, good, 'cause that's what I want, too.

260
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:38,840
<10-1,Leonard>现在我们得以绿巨人和女绿巨人的装扮出现
<10-1,Leonard>Now we're going as Hulk and She-Hulk.

261
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:42,180
<10-1,Leonard>我不想在漫展上脱掉上衣啊
<10-1,Leonard>I don't want to take my shirt off at Comic-Con.

262
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:46,350
<10-2,Sheldon>如果我能代漫展发言  我会说我们也不希望这事发生
<10-2,Sheldon>If I may speak for Comic-Con, we don't want that either.

263
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,900
<10-3,Leonard>需要这么毒吗
<10-3,Leonard>Is that nice?

264
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,210
<10-4,Sheldon>不用  但至少诚实啊  而且感觉起来
<10-4,Sheldon>No, but it's honest, and it sounds like you could use

265
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,490
<10-4,Sheldon>你们的感情也需要多一点真诚
<10-4,Sheldon>a little more honesty in your relationship.

266
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:54,790
<10-5,Leonard>实际情况远比嘴上说来得复杂
<10-5,Leonard>Uh, I-it's more complicated than that.

267
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,360
<10-6,Sheldon>我一直诚实对待艾米
<10-6,Sheldon>I'm always honest with Amy.

268
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,480
<10-6,Sheldon>有一天她说觉得难为情
<10-6,Sheldon>The other day she said she was self-conscious

269
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,520
<10-6,Sheldon>因为肩膀上有颗美人印
<10-6,Sheldon>about the beauty mark on her shoulder,

270
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,890
<10-6,Sheldon>而我说  "随你美化你那个美人印
<10-6,Sheldon>and I said, "You know, you can call that a beauty mark all you want.

271
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:06,460
<10-6,Sheldon>但当它上面长了根毛  那它就是个痣"
<10-6,Sheldon>When there's hair growing out of it, that's a mole."

272
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,830
<10-7,Leonard>你觉得她也对你如此诚实吗
<10-7,Leonard>Do you think she's as honest with you?

273
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,120
<10-8,Sheldon>我希望是如此
<10-8,Sheldon>I should hope so.

274
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,910
<10-8,Sheldon>当她称我为没心没肺的混蛋时
<10-8,Sheldon>When she called me an insensitive jerk,

275
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:15,510
<10-8,Sheldon>我会希望她是真心的
<10-8,Sheldon>I'd like to think she meant it.

276
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,970
<11-1,Howard>肯定有其他让你挣外快的法子
<11-1,Howard>There's got to be other ways you can make a quick buck.

277
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:22,390
<11-2,Raj>哪这么容易找
<11-2,Raj>Yeah, you'd think.

278
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:26,190
<11-2,Raj>或许我可以去卖血卖精子
<11-2,Raj>Ooh, maybe I could sell my blood and sperm.

279
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:30,200
<11-3,Bernadette>我真应该在脖子上系个铃铛
<11-3,Bernadette>I really should wear a bell around my neck

280
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,350
<11-3,Bernadette>这样我一来  你们就能听见
<11-3,Bernadette>so you guys can hear me coming.

281
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:34,100
<11-4,Raj>来  我帮你吧
<11-4,Raj>Here, let me help you.

282
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,390
<11-5,Bernadette>谢谢
<11-5,Bernadette>Thank you.

283
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,020
<11-6,Raj>双层夹心奥利奥
<11-6,Raj>Oh, Double Stuf Oreos,

284
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:40,020
<11-6,Raj>我还记得当初我吃得起的日子
<11-6,Raj>I remember when I could afford you.

285
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,620
<11-7,Bernadette>哈雷又哭了
<11-7,Bernadette>There she goes.

286
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,420
<11-8,Raj>你待着  我去吧
<11-8,Raj>Stay, I'll get her.

287
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,070
<11-9,Bernadette>-非常感谢  -不客气
<11-9,Bernadette>- Appreciate it. - That's fine.

288
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:48,110
<11-10,Raj>我可以和她一起抱头痛哭
<11-10,Raj>She and I can cry together.

289
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,010
<11-11,Bernadette>他真是个好人
<11-11,Bernadette>He's such a sweetie.

290
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:53,480
<11-12,Howard>我知道  真希望我们能有办法帮他
<11-12,Howard>I know, I wish there was some way we could help him.

291
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,980
<11-13,Bernadette>如果他可以找到一个薪水高的女朋友
<11-13,Bernadette>If he could find a girl with a good job,

292
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,480
<11-13,Bernadette>那他所有的问题将迎刃而解
<11-13,Bernadette>all his problems would be over.

293
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,940
<11-14,Howard>是啊  看我现在过得多"好"
<11-14,Howard>Yeah, that's working out great for me.

294
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,690
<12-1,Amy>佩妮说他们准备好出发了
<12-1,Amy>Penny says they're ready to go.

295
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,210
<12-2,Sheldon>很好
<12-2,Sheldon>Very well.

296
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:09,530
<12-2,Sheldon>准备迎接漫长的欺骗夜吧
<12-2,Sheldon>Prepare for a long night of deceit.

297
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:15,090
<12-3,Amy>谢尔顿  女人可以化妆  那不叫欺骗
<12-3,Amy>Sheldon, women can wear makeup, it's not lying.

298
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:17,040
<12-4,Sheldon>我刚说的是莱纳德
<12-4,Sheldon>I was talking about Leonard.

299
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,700
<12-4,Sheldon>而且如果化妆品这么诚我不欺
<12-4,Sheldon>And if makeup is so truthful,

300
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,460
<12-4,Sheldon>那为什么有化妆品叫"遮瑕膏"[隐瞒者]
<12-4,Sheldon>why is it called "Concealer"?

301
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:24,180
<12-5,Amy>等等  莱纳德欺骗什么了
<12-5,Amy>Wait, wait, wait, what's Leonard lying about?

302
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,040
<12-6,Sheldon>他其实不想佩妮去漫展
<12-6,Sheldon>He doesn't really want Penny to go to Comic-Con.

303
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,310
<12-6,Sheldon>他是为了让她开心才带她去
<12-6,Sheldon>He's just doing it to make her happy.

304
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:29,720
<12-6,Sheldon>真的吗
<12-6,Sheldon>Really?

305
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,520
<12-7,Amy>因为佩妮其实并不想去漫展
<12-7,Amy>Because she doesn't actually want to go.

306
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,060
<12-7,Amy>她是为了让他开心才跟他去
<12-7,Amy>She's just doing it to make him happy.

307
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,090
<12-8,Sheldon>所以他们俩的本意是想让对方开心
<12-8,Sheldon>So they're both trying to make each other happy,

308
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:39,730
<12-8,Sheldon>而结果却是让彼此恶心吗
<12-8,Sheldon>and the end result is they make each other sad?

309
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:42,560
<12-8,Sheldon>真是太可笑了
<12-8,Sheldon>That's hilarious.

310
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:46,030
<12-8,Sheldon>我等不及要告诉他们了
<12-8,Sheldon>I can't wait to tell them.

311
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:47,750
<12-9,Amy>不  你不能拆穿他们
<12-9,Amy>No, you're not gonna tell them anything.

312
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,460
<12-9,Amy>你不许插手这件事
<12-9,Amy>You're gonna stay out of it.

313
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,260
<12-10,Sheldon>为什么
<12-10,Sheldon>Why?

314
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,270
<12-11,Amy>因为这是他们之间的事
<12-11,Amy>Because it's between them.

315
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,220
<12-12,Sheldon>你难道没注意到吗
<12-12,Sheldon>Well, if you haven't noticed,

316
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:56,810
<12-12,Sheldon>过去十年里我一直生活在他们之间
<12-12,Sheldon>I've been between them for the last ten years.

317
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:00,940
<12-16,Penny>宝贝  你想开车吗
<12-16,Penny>Hey, babe, you want to drive?

318
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,160
<12-17,Leonard>当然  不过你开也行
<12-17,Leonard>Sure, or you can.

319
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,580
<12-18,Penny>没关系  我知道你不喜欢我开车的方式
<12-18,Penny>No, it's fine, I know you don't like the way I drive.

320
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,920
<12-19,Leonard>我对你开车技术没有意见啊
<12-19,Leonard>I don't have a problem with your driving.

321
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,050
<12-20,Sheldon>你听见他们的鬼话了吗
<12-20,Sheldon>Are you listening to this?

322
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:11,000
<12-20,Sheldon>他们在所有事情上都欺骗对方
<12-20,Sheldon>They deceive each other about everything.

323
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:17,270
<12-22,Penny>我告诉你  是停车场那家伙撞我
<12-22,Penny>Just so you know, that guy in the parking lot hit me.

324
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:20,440
<12-23,Leonard>他当时都不在车上好吗  不过行吧
<12-23,Leonard>He wasn't in a car, but okay.

325
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,110
<12-24,Penny>你直说你想开不得了
<12-24,Penny>Just say you want to drive.

326
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:25,520
<12-25,Leonard>我真的不想开
<12-25,Leonard>I honestly don't.

327
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,800
<12-26,Penny>艾米  帮个忙  你开车吧
<12-26,Penny>Amy, do us a favor, please drive.

328
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,400
<12-27,Amy>好  乐意效劳
<12-27,Amy>Sure, happy to.

329
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,680
<12-28,Leonard>如果你想开车  那就开啊
<12-28,Leonard>If you want to drive, just drive.

330
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,480
<12-28,Leonard>我不懂为什么要搞得这么复杂
<12-28,Leonard>I don't see why this has to be so complicated.

331
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,620
<12-29,Penny>一点都不复杂  艾米开车  就这样
<12-29,Penny>It's not complicated. Amy's driving, that's it!

332
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,850
<12-30,Leonard>才不是  谁都看得出你不高兴
<12-30,Leonard>That's not it because you're clearly upset.

333
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:41,470
<12-31,Penny>你才是看上去不高兴的那个
<12-31,Penny>You're the one who seems upset.

334
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:42,490
<12-32,Leonard>我为什么要不高兴
<12-32,Leonard>Why would I be upset?

335
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:45,620
<12-33,Amy>因为你不想她去参加漫展
<12-33,Amy>Because you don't want her to go to Comic-Con!

336
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,720
<12-34,Sheldon>这种"不插手"的方式真是相当有意思啊
<12-34,Sheldon>This is an interesting way to stay out of it.

337
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:54,220
<12-35,Penny>慢着  你不想我去吗
<12-35,Penny>Wait, you don't want me to go?

338
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:57,550
<12-36,Leonard>我只是觉得你不会觉得好玩
<12-36,Leonard>Well, I just don't think you're gonna have a good time.

339
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:58,510
<12-37,Sheldon>是啊  听好了
<12-37,Sheldon>Yeah, well, get this:

340
00:14:58,510 --> 00:14:59,500
<12-37,Sheldon>佩妮也是这么想的
<12-37,Sheldon>neither does Penny,

341
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,180
<12-37,Sheldon>所以她并不想去
<12-37,Sheldon>that's why she doesn't want to go.

342
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,490
<12-37,Sheldon>你下套  我下刀  合作无间
<12-37,Sheldon>You set 'em up, I knock 'em down, good job.

343
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:09,140
<12-38,Leonard>如果你不想去  为什么你不直说
<12-38,Leonard>Why would you say you wanted to go if you didn't?

344
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:11,060
<12-39,Penny>我本以为跟着去会让你开心
<12-39,Penny>I just thought it would make you happy.

345
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:14,660
<12-40,Leonard>好吧  等等  如果你不想跟去
<12-40,Leonard>O-O-O-Okay, hold on, so if you don't want to go

346
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,740
<12-40,Leonard>而我也不必带你去
<12-40,Leonard>and I don't need to bring you,

347
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,670
<12-40,Leonard>我们还是恩爱好夫妻吧
<12-40,Leonard>is everything good?

348
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:22,170
<12-41,Penny>等等  我先决定我是不是在生你气
<12-41,Penny>Hold on, I'm trying to decide if I'm mad at you.

349
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,470
<12-41,Penny>不会  不用去我很开心
<12-41,Penny>No, I'm happy I don't have to go.

350
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:27,570
<12-42,Leonard>好啦  问题解决
<12-42,Leonard>All right, problem solved.

351
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:28,620
<12-43,Penny>-没错  -对
<12-43,Penny>- Okay. - Yeah.

352
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,870
<12-44,Sheldon>还没完呢  刚才不是还在吵谁开车吗
<12-44,Sheldon>Not entirely, the fight over who's going to drive is still...

353
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,440
<12-45,Amy>天啊  快把嘴闭上
<12-45,Amy>Oh, my God, stop talking!

354
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:36,700
<13-1,Amy>家里看着好干净啊
<13-1,Amy>The place looks great.

355
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,240
<13-1,Amy>你们请佣人了吗
<13-1,Amy>Did you guys get a maid?

356
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,500
<13-2,Bernadette>算是吧
<13-2,Bernadette>Kind of.

357
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:42,450
<13-3,Howard>晚餐快好了
<13-3,Howard>Dinner's almost ready.

358
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:45,630
<13-3,Howard>如果你们喜欢烘肉卷  那肯定会喜欢它的表亲
<13-3,Howard>If you like meatloaf, I'm sure you'll like its cousin,

359
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:47,980
<13-3,Howard>大碗肉
<13-3,Howard>bowl of meat.

360
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,060
<13-4,Penny>如果你还想着挣外快
<13-4,Penny>Hey, if you're still looking to make money,

<13-4,Penny>我愿意付钱让你把外套烧了
<13-4,Penny>I will pay you to burn that jacket.

<13-5,Raj>我是无缘漫展了
<13-5,Raj>I'm going to Comic-Con this year.

364
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:01,280
<13-6,Sheldon>你有这么多债务在身
<13-6,Sheldon>Well, with as much debt as you have,

365
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,840
<13-6,Sheldon>明年应该也不能去
<13-6,Sheldon>probably not next year either.

366
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:06,790
<13-7,Bernadette>-华仔  -好的

<13-10,Bernadette>还有照顾哈雷的酬劳
<13-10,Bernadette>and taking care of Halley you've done.

371
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:18,540
<13-11,Howard>里面的钱就算你去参加漫展还绰绰有余
<13-11,Howard>There's more than enough in there to cover Comic-Con.

372
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:22,390
<13-12,Stuart>我也帮忙照顾哈雷了啊
<13-12,Stuart>Um, I also take care of Halley.

373
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,530
<13-13,Bernadette>你也在这里白住了啊
<13-13,Bernadette>And you live here for free.

<13-14,Stuart>I do, ma'am, thank you, ma'am.

375
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:30,780
<13-15,Raj>你们真是太慷慨了
<13-15,Raj>This is so generous of you,

376
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,450
<13-15,Raj>我...我都不知道该说什么了
<13-15,Raj>I-I, um, I don't know what to say.

377
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,650
<13-16,Leonard>现在你可以跟我们一起去了
<13-16,Leonard>Now you can come with us.

378
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:36,840
<13-17,Penny>对啊  谢尔顿脚边还有地方睡哦
<13-17,Penny>Yeah, there's room in the bed by Sheldon's feet.

379
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:39,810
<13-18,Raj>尽管我很感激你们给我这笔钱
<13-18,Raj>As much as I appreciate this,

380
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:40,980
<13-18,Raj>可我不能收
<13-18,Raj>I can't accept it.

381
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:41,650
<13-18,Raj>好吗
<13-18,Raj>Okay?

382
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:42,730
<13-18,Raj>哈雷是我的教女
<13-18,Raj>Halley's my goddaughter,

383
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:44,390
<13-18,Raj>我照顾她是应该的  不是为了钱
<13-18,Raj>I don't take care of her for money.

384
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:46,240
<13-19,Stuart>我是
<13-19,Stuart>I would.

385
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:50,890
<13-20,Bernadette>留着吧  就当是我们送你的礼物
<13-20,Bernadette>Keep it. Consider it a gift.

386
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:54,040
<13-21,Sheldon>等等  这到底是补发工资还是礼物
<13-21,Sheldon>Hold on. Is it back pay or is it a gift?

387
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,230
<13-22,Bernadette>有什么区别吗
<13-22,Bernadette>What's the difference?

388
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:57,100
<13-23,Sheldon>当我们被关在不同房间被国税局审问时
<13-23,Sheldon>When the IRS questions us in separate rooms,

389
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,630
<13-23,Sheldon>我们的答案必须一致啊
<13-23,Sheldon>we need to have our stories straight.

390
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:02,010
<13-24,Raj>无所谓啦  反正我不会收下
<13-24,Raj>It doesn't matter. I'm not keeping this.

391
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:04,210
<13-24,Raj>我正努力自食其力  做一个有担当的人
<13-24,Raj>I'm trying to pay my own way and be responsible.

392
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:06,140
<13-24,Raj>拿别人给的钱可不行
<13-24,Raj>Taking handouts won't help that.

393
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:08,120
<13-25,Amy>所以你不去参加漫展了吗
<13-25,Amy>So you're not going to Comic-Con?

394
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,580
<13-26,Raj>反正我去过很多次了
<13-26,Raj>I've been plenty of times.

395
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:13,690
<13-26,Raj>少去一次也没关系  我是个成年人了
<13-26,Raj>If I miss one, it's fine. I'm a big boy.

396
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:15,500
<13-27,Sheldon>我也是成年人  但如果我少去了一次
<13-27,Sheldon>I'm a big boy, and if I missed one,

397
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,340
<13-27,Sheldon>我就会发成年人的脾气
<13-27,Sheldon>I'd throw a big-boy tantrum.

398
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,510
<13-28,Leonard>其实我都去了12次了
<13-28,Leonard>You know what? I've gone 12 times.

399
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:24,020
<13-28,Leonard>要不今年我也不参加了吧
<13-28,Leonard>Maybe I'll sit out this year, too.

400
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:25,460
<13-29,Penny>-真的吗  -真的
<13-29,Penny>- Really? - Yeah.

401
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,680
<13-30,Leonard>或许我们那周末可以找点好玩的事情干
<13-30,Leonard>Maybe you and I can do something fun that weekend.

402
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,250
<13-31,Penny>一起去漂流怎么样
<13-31,Penny>Ooh, how about white-water rafting?

403
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,120
<13-32,Leonard>不如我们折中一下
<13-32,Leonard>Oh... how about we compromise

404
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:35,910
<13-32,Leonard>去迪士尼玩小小世界之旅
<13-32,Leonard>and go on the Small World ride at Disneyland?

405
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:35,910
<13-32,Leonard>乘坐小船游览由身穿各地民族服饰的木偶
<13-32,Leonard>和活动布景组成的全球七大洲

406
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:39,790
<13-33,Howard>要不我也不去了
<13-33,Howard>You know what, I'm not gonna go either.

407
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:40,930
<13-33,Howard>我现在身为人父
<13-33,Howard>I'm a father now.

408
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:44,400
<13-33,Howard>我更愿意跟家人待在一起
<13-33,Howard>I'd rather spend time with my family.

409
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,970
<13-34,Bernadette>你只是不想跟谢尔顿两人一起去
<13-34,Bernadette>You just don't want to go alone with Sheldon.

410
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:47,600
<13-35,Howard>我去看看晚餐好了没
<13-35,Howard>I'm gonna go check on dinner.

411
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:52,490
<13-36,Amy>听起来大家都不去了
<13-36,Amy>Sounds like everyone's staying home.

412
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:54,400
<13-36,Amy>那你怎么说
<13-36,Amy>What do you say?

413
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,790
<13-37,Sheldon>谁不去谁傻逼  反正我是要去
<13-37,Sheldon>Nuts to that, I'm going to Comic-Con!

414
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:59,280
<13-38,Amy>就你自己去吗
<13-38,Amy>By yourself?

415
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,720
<13-39,Sheldon>不一定啊
<13-39,Sheldon>Not necessarily.

416
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,260
<13-39,Sheldon>我还有四个月的时间找新朋友陪我去
<13-39,Sheldon>I have four months to find some new friends.

417
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,730
<13-40,Stuart>我陪你去
<13-40,Stuart>I'll go with you.

418
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:06,620
<13-41,Sheldon>你人真好  斯图尔特
<13-41,Sheldon>That's very kind of you, Stuart.

419
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:09,660
<13-41,Sheldon>等七月的时候你再问我一次
<13-41,Sheldon>Check back in with me in July.

420
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:19,170
<14-1,Sheldon>瞧瞧我的漂亮女友
<14-1,Sheldon>There's my pretty girlfriend.

421
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:23,320
<14-2,Amy>我是不会跟你去漫展的
<14-2,Amy>I'm not going with you to Comic-Con.

422
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,910
<14-3,Sheldon>干嘛  难道就不能因为见到自己女人很开心
<14-3,Sheldon>What? Can't a man just be happy to see his woman

423
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:29,000
<14-3,Sheldon>然后就拍拍她第二性感的部位
<14-3,Sheldon>and pat her on her second most erogenous

424
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,350
<14-3,Sheldon>球窝关节吗
<14-3,Sheldon>ball-and-socket joint?

425
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:37,310
<14-4,Amy>能啊  但我还是不会改变主意
<14-4,Amy>He can, but it's still not changing my mind.

426
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:41,840
<14-5,Sheldon>或许我裤裆里的东西能让你改变主意
<14-5,Sheldon>Well, maybe what's in my pants will change your mind.

427
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,790
<14-5,Sheldon>这是今年明星座谈会的嘉宾名单
<14-5,Sheldon>It's a list of this year's panelists.

428
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:55,820
<14-5,Sheldon>很长  对不对
<14-5,Sheldon>It's long, isn't it?
