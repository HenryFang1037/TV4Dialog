1
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,630
<1-1,Sheldon>老天爷啊
<1-1,Sheldon>Oh, boy.

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:07,330
<1-2,Leonard>干嘛
<1-2,Leonard>What?

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:11,430
<1-3,Sheldon>我无法在不违法协议的情况下 批评你的作品
<1-3,Sheldon>I can't comment without violating our agreement that i'll not criticize your work.

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,160
<1-4,Leonard>那你还说"老天爷"
<1-4,Leonard>Then what was "Oh, boy"?

5
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:17,460
<1-5,Sheldon>我已经相当克制自己了
<1-5,Sheldon>Great restraint on my part.

6
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:20,060
<1-6,Leonard>我的科学研究没有问题
<1-6,Leonard>There's nothing wrong with the science here.

7
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,500
<1-7,Sheldon>你所谓的"科学研究"  跟我的相比
<1-7,Sheldon>Perhaps you mean a different thing than I do

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,830
<1-7,Sheldon>相差甚远吧
<1-7,Sheldon>when you say, "Science."

9
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:32,900
<1-8,Leonard (making a change)>这样呢
<1-8,Leonard (making a change)>Okay, how's that?

10
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,660
<1-9,Sheldon>其实刚刚的才是对的
<1-9,Sheldon>You actually had it right in the first place.

11
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:41,460
<1-9,Sheldon>你又掉进我的 经典恶作剧陷阱了
<1-9,Sheldon>Once again, you've fallen for one of my classic pranks.

12
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:42,600
<1-9,Sheldon>气死你
<1-9,Sheldon>Bazinga!

13
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:50,360
<1-9,Sheldon>收到一封很怪的邮件
<1-9,Sheldon>Now here's a peculiar e-mail.

14
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,730
<1-9,Sheldon>大学校长要我明天早上8点
<1-9,Sheldon>The president of the university wants me to meet him

15
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,860
<1-9,Sheldon>去他办公室见他
<1-9,Sheldon>at his office tomorrow morning at 8:00 a.m.

16
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:55,860
<1-10,Leonard>-为什么  -没说
<1-10,Leonard>- Why? - It doesn't say.

17
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,700
<1-11,Sheldon>肯定是紧急事件
<1-11,Sheldon>It must be an emergency.

18
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,400
<1-11,Sheldon>大学里的人都知道  我8点吃早餐
<1-11,Sheldon>Everyone at the university knows I eat breakfast at 8:00

19
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,960
<1-11,Sheldon>8点20肠胃开始消化
<1-11,Sheldon>and move my bowels at 8:20.

20
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:07,160
<1-12,Leonard>没用啁啾鸟网站前过的是什么日子
<1-12,Leonard>Yes, how did we live before Twitter?

21
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:10,630
<1-12,Leonard>明天早上就知道什么事了
<1-12,Leonard>I guess you'll find out what it is in the morning.

22
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,460
<1-13,Sheldon>还要14个小时呢
<1-13,Sheldon>That's 14 hours away.

23
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:14,860
<1-13,Sheldon>接下来840分钟
<1-13,Sheldon>For the next 840 minutes,

24
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:17,300
<1-13,Sheldon>我会像海森堡的粒子
<1-13,Sheldon>I'm effectively one of Heisenberg's particles;

25
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,800
<1-13,Sheldon>只知道自己的地点或移动速度
<1-13,Sheldon>I know where I am or I know how fast I'm going,

26
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:20,960
<1-13,Sheldon>但却不能同时知道两者
<1-13,Sheldon>but I can't know both.

27
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:22,700
<1-13,Sheldon>那我怎么受得了
<1-13,Sheldon>Yet how am I supposed to carry on

28
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,730
<1-13,Sheldon>这些恼人的东西老在我脑子里乱转
<1-13,Sheldon>with this huge annoying thing hovering over my head?

29
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,630
<1-14,Leonard>我很清楚这种感觉
<1-14,Leonard>Yeah, I know the feeling.

<2-2,Leonard>Sheldon, it's 2:00 in the morning.

43
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:04,830
<2-3,Sheldon>怎么每个人都跟我说现在几点
<2-3,Sheldon>Why is everybody keep telling me what time it is?

44
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:05,930
<2-4,Leonard>每个人
<2-4,Leonard>Everybody?

00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:08,960
<2-5,Sheldon>你  大学校长 还有他妻子
<2-5,Sheldon>You, the president of the university, his wife,

46
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,790
<2-5,Sheldon>他们气急败坏的女儿
<2-5,Sheldon>their sullen teenage daughter.

47
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:16,260
<2-5,Sheldon>他们全家都对现在几点 别人知不知道很感兴趣
<2-5,Sheldon>That entire family is fascinated by what time it is and whether people know it.

48
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:19,530
<2-6,Leonard>你居然在半夜跑去 塞伯特校长家
<2-6,Leonard>You went to President Seibert's house in the middle of the night?

49
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,360
<2-7,Sheldon>他没回复我的邮件
<2-7,Sheldon>He didn't respond to my e-mail,

50
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,590
<2-7,Sheldon>我又不知道他的电话
<2-7,Sheldon>his phone number is unlisted.

51
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:25,230
<2-7,Sheldon>那我还能怎么办
<2-7,Sheldon>Tell me what my other option was.

52
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:27,630
<2-8,Leonard>你可以等到早上啊
<2-8,Leonard>You could have waited until morning.

53
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:30,130
<2-8,Leonard>对  对于你是不可能
<2-8,Leonard>I know, look who I'm talking to.

54
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:33,930
<2-9,Sheldon>你还记得我向
<2-9,Sheldon>Do you remember the grant proposal I submitted

55
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:36,760
<2-9,Sheldon>国家科学基金会提交的 申请去北极勘测
<2-9,Sheldon>to the National Science Foundation to detect slow-moving monopoles

56
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:38,560
<2-9,Sheldon>慢速磁单极子的申请吗
<2-9,Sheldon>at the magnetic North Pole?

57
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:42,430
<2-10,Leonard>一天不记都不行呢
<2-10,Leonard>Hardly a day goes by when I don't think about it.

58
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:44,130
<2-11,Sheldon>你真好
<2-11,Sheldon>Aw, how nice.

59
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,430
<2-11,Sheldon>基金会的北极考察队员
<2-11,Sheldon>Well, a space opened up

60
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:50,130
<2-11,Sheldon>确定最后一刻  空出了空位
<2-11,Sheldon>at the last minute on the NSF expedition to the Arctic Circle.

61
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:52,830
<2-12,Leonard>等等
<2-12,Leonard>Wait a minute.

62
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:56,490
<2-12,Leonard>他批准让你去北极
<2-12,Leonard>He offered to send you to the North Pole?

63
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,660
<2-12,Leonard>对
<2-12,Leonard>Yes.

64
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:59,790
<2-13,Sheldon>他还相当热情呢
<2-13,Sheldon>In fact, he was quite enthusiastic.

65
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,090
<2-13,Sheldon>他说"坦白说"
<2-13,Sheldon>He said, "Frankly,

66
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,760
<2-13,Sheldon>"我巴不得今晚就送你去"
<2-13,Sheldon>if I could send you tonight, I would."

67
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:07,060
<2-14,Leonard>那你想去吗
<2-14,Leonard>Okay, well, do you want to go?

68
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:09,130
<2-14,Leonard>当然不想
<2-14,Leonard>Of course not.

69
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,560
<2-15,Sheldon>我是理论物理学家
<2-15,Sheldon>I'm a theoretical physicist.

70
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:13,860
<2-15,Sheldon>我选这个职业完全出于能在家办公
<2-15,Sheldon>A career I chose in no small part because it's indoors,

71
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:18,790
<2-15,Sheldon>但如果我能在北极 勘测出慢速磁单极子
<2-15,Sheldon>but if I'm able to detect slow-moving magnetic monopoles there,

72
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:21,560
<2-15,Sheldon>我就能成为证明弦理论的科学家
<2-15,Sheldon>I will be the scientis to confirm string theory.

73
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,630
<2-15,Sheldon>人们会写书赞扬我
<2-15,Sheldon>People will write books about me.

74
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:29,090
<2-15,Sheldon>三年级学生会做意粉画 描绘我的一生呢
<2-15,Sheldon>Third-graders will create macaroni-art dioramas depicting scenes from my life.

75
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:33,760
<2-16,Leonard>当然  说不定画个我揍死你的场景
<2-16,Leonard>Sure, maybe a tableau of me trying to pummel you to death.

76
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:35,430
<2-17,Sheldon>冷嘲热讽?
<2-17,Sheldon>Sarcasm?

77
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:37,130
<2-18,Leonard>有可能
<2-18,Leonard>Maybe.

78
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:41,330
<2-19,Sheldon>真叫人难以取舍
<2-19,Sheldon>I'm on the horns of a dilemma.

79
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:45,260
<2-19,Sheldon>你能想象我  谢尔顿·库珀  在北极吗
<2-19,Sheldon>Can you imagine me, Sheldon Cooper, at the North Pole?

80
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,360
<2-20,Leonard>小菜一碟  我现在就想着呢
<2-20,Leonard>Easy peasy, I'm doing it right now.

81
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:50,590
<2-21,Sheldon>但我怕冷啊  莱纳德
<2-21,Sheldon>I'm not good with cold, Leonard.

82
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,730
<2-21,Sheldon>我们都多少次因为我喝冰吸太快
<2-21,Sheldon>How often have we had to leave a movie theater

83
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:53,890
<2-21,Sheldon>结果头疼
<2-21,Sheldon>because I got a headache

84
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,590
<2-21,Sheldon>提前离开电影院了
<2-21,Sheldon>from drinking the Icee too fast?

85
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,690
<2-21,Sheldon>我不能去
<2-21,Sheldon>I can't go.

86
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:58,890
<2-22,Leonard>那就别去
<2-22,Leonard>Well, then don't go.

87
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,360
<2-23,Sheldon>你怎么能这么说
<2-23,Sheldon>How can you say that?

88
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:03,490
<2-23,Sheldon>难得的科学机遇就在眼前
<2-23,Sheldon>The scientific opportunity of a lifetime

89
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,830
<2-23,Sheldon>我最好的朋友却让我不要去
<2-23,Sheldon>presents itself and my best friend says "Don't go."

90
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:07,060
<2-24,Leonard>那就去呗
<2-24,Leonard>All right, then go.

91
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:10,430
<2-25,Sheldon>听听你说的话
<2-25,Sheldon>Listen to you.

92
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:12,790
<2-25,Sheldon>我怎么去啊
<2-25,Sheldon>How can I possibly go?

93
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,260
<2-26,Leonard>谢尔顿  我到底要说什么
<2-26,Leonard>Sheldon, what are the words I can say right now

94
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:17,890
<2-26,Leonard>才能结束这个话题  让我回去睡觉
<2-26,Leonard>to end this conversation and let me go back to sleep?

95
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:23,960
<2-27,Sheldon>真奇怪  塞伯特校长也这么问我
<2-27,Sheldon>Odd, President Seibert posed the exact same question.

96
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,960
<2-28,Leonard>结果呢
<2-28,Leonard>How was it resolved?

97
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:30,660
<2-29,Sheldon>没结果  她妻子放狗咬我 结果没下文了
<2-29,Sheldon>It wasn't. His wife set their dogs on me and rendered the question moot.

98
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,790
<3-1,Howard>想象一下  如果他答应了
<3-1,Howard>Just imagine. If he says yes,

99
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:39,230
<3-1,Howard>我们就能享受整个没谢尔顿的夏天
<3-1,Howard>we'll have an entire summer without Sheldon.

100
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:41,790
<3-2,Raj>我们能去户外玩儿
<3-2,Raj>We could play outside.

101
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:45,560
<3-3,Howard>我们能坐在沙发左边
<3-3,Howard>We could sit on the left side of the couch.

102
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:48,460
<3-4,Leonard>我能在8点20上厕所
<3-4,Leonard>I could use the bathroom at 8:20.

103
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:55,090
<3-5,Raj>我们的梦想真渺小啊
<3-5,Raj>Our dreams are very small, aren't they?

104
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,590
<3-6,Sheldon>好消息  先生们  我暂时接受了
<3-6,Sheldon>Good news, gentlemen, I have tentatively accepted...

105
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,160
<3-7,All>好耶
<3-7,All>Yeah!

106
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:09,690
<3-8,Sheldon>加入北极考察队的邀请
<3-8,Sheldon>...the invitation to join the Arctic Expedition.

107
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,230
<3-9,Leonard>-没有你怎么行  -祝马到成功
<3-9,Leonard>- It's not gonna be the same without you. - Godspeed.

108
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,100
<3-11,Sheldon>谢谢 但别高兴得太早
<3-11,Sheldon>Thank you, but your sentiments may be premature.

109
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:19,700
<3-12,Raj>我有不祥的预感
<3-12,Raj>Ooh, I don't like where this is going.

110
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:22,570
<3-13,Sheldon>我正式提议
<3-13,Sheldon>I would like to propose...

111
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,240
<3-13,Sheldon>你们三个和我一起去
<3-13,Sheldon>that the three of you accompany me.

112
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:27,600
<3-14,Howard>去北极?
<3-14,Howard>To the North Pole?

113
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:28,900
<3-15,Sheldon>是滴
<3-15,Sheldon>Yes.

114
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:32,240
<3-16,Raj>是为了确保你走后 我们不会碰你的东西么
<3-16,Raj>Is this just so we won't touch your stuff while you're away?

115
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:35,940
<3-17,Sheldon>我承认我是有此顾虑
<3-17,Sheldon>I'll admit that was a concern.

116
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,070
<3-17,Sheldon>但事实是
<3-17,Sheldon>But the fact is,

117
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,740
<3-17,Sheldon>我需要一个团队协助我
<3-17,Sheldon>I'll need a support team.

118
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,000
<3-17,Sheldon>你们三个呢
<3-17,Sheldon>And the three of you

119
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,070
<3-17,Sheldon>是我的最佳人选
<3-17,Sheldon>are my first choice.

120
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:41,820
<3-18,Howard>真的
<3-18,Howard>Really?

121
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,870
<3-19,Sheldon>的确有很多人比你们更加够格
<3-19,Sheldon>Well, there are others who might be more qualified,

122
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:46,130
<3-19,Sheldon>但一想到要面试他们我就胃疼
<3-19,Sheldon>but the thought of interviewing them gave me a stomachache.

123
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,870
<3-19,Sheldon>我知道这个提议比较重大
<3-19,Sheldon>Now, I know I'm proposing an enormous undertaking,

124
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:52,670
<3-19,Sheldon>你们花几分钟讨论一下吧
<3-19,Sheldon>so why don't you take a few moments to discuss it?

125
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,770
<3-20,Howard>我们不会真要和他
<3-20,Howard>We're not really gonna go to the North Pole

126
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:57,970
<3-20,Howard>跑去北极吧
<3-20,Howard>with him, are we?

127
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:01,130
<3-21,Sheldon (voice)>我现在还能听得到
<3-21,Sheldon (voice)>I'm still within earshot!

128
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,730
<3-21,Sheldon (voice)>你们得等我把门关上
<3-21,Sheldon (voice)>You may want to wait for my door to close.

129
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,500
<3-19,Sheldon>我们不会真要和他
<3-19,Sheldon>We're not really gonna go

130
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:08,500
<3-20,Howard>跑去北极吧
<3-20,Howard>to the North Pole with him, are we?

131
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:10,170
<3-23,Leonard>等下  咱们想想
<3-23,Leonard>Hang on. Let's talk about it.

132
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,700
<3-23,Leonard>这是国家科学基金探险项目
<3-23,Leonard>This is a National Science Foundation expedition.

133
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:14,730
<3-23,Leonard>咱们怎么能拒绝呢
<3-23,Leonard>I don't know how we can turn it down.

134
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,830
<3-24,Howard>简单  不是说我们不想参加基金探险项目
<3-24,Howard>Easy. Instead of saying, "No, we don't want to go on an NSF expedition,"

135
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,070
<3-24,Howard>而是我们不想花
<3-24,Howard>say, "No, we don't want to spend

136
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,830
<3-24,Howard>跟一个疯子杵在北极圈的小木屋里
<3-24,Howard>"three months stuck in a cabin in the Arctic Circle

137
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,970
<3-24,Howard>长达三个月
<3-24,Howard>with an anal nutbag."

138
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:29,530
<3-25,Raj>但如果我们能成为证实弦理论团队的一员
<3-25,Raj>But if we were part of the team that confirmed string theory,

139
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,830
<3-25,Raj>我们就能去任何大学城的酒吧免费喝酒
<3-25,Raj>we could drink for free in any bar in any college town

140
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:37,830
<3-25,Raj>只要那个大学有比较强的科学研究组织
<3-25,Raj>with a university that has a strong science program.

141
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,230
<3-26,Leonard>霍华德  这可是重大科研项目
<3-26,Leonard>Howard, this is big science.

142
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,270
<3-26,Leonard>你可以成为那个组建仪器的工程师
<3-26,Leonard>You could be the engineer who builds the equipment

143
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:43,130
<3-26,Leonard>我们能因此上杂志封面呢
<3-26,Leonard>that puts us on the cover of magazines.

144
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,330
<3-27,Howard>我也可以成为那个造出一把弩弓
<3-27,Howard>I could also be the engineer

145
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,400
<3-27,Howard>用来射杀谢尔顿的工程师
<3-27,Howard>who builds the crossbow that kills Sheldon.

146
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:55,170
<3-28,Raj>你仍然可能因此上杂志
<3-28,Raj>You still might get on a magazine.

147
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:58,500
<3-29,Howard>你们俩真的慎重考虑过了
<3-29,Howard>So you guys are seriously considering this?

148
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:01,100
<3-31,Howard>-是的  -你们觉得能受得了谢尔顿
<3-31,Howard>- Yes. - And you think you can put up with Sheldon?

149
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:04,000
<3-32,Raj>我是印度人嘛
<3-32,Raj>Well, I'm a Hindu.

150
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:06,730
<3-32,Raj>我的信仰告诉我  今生的苦难
<3-32,Raj>My religion teaches that if we suffer in this life

151
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,430
<3-32,Raj>来世将转为福音
<3-32,Raj>we are rewarded in the next.

152

<3-32,Raj>和谢尔顿在北极历练三个月
<3-32,Raj>Three months at the North Pole with Sheldon,

153
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:14,500
<3-32,Raj>我能重生成一个身材火爆又会飞的亿万富翁
<3-32,Raj>and I'm reborn as a well-hung billionaire with wings!

154
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:24,730
<3-33,Sheldon>先生们  做出决定了么
<3-33,Sheldon>Well, gentlemen, have you reached a decision?

00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,170
<4-46,Leonard>但是你不觉得我整个夏天都不在

223
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:18,270
<4-46,Leonard>她会感到些许的难过吗
<4-46,Leonard>that I'm going to be gone for the whole summer?

224
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:21,270
<4-47,Sheldon>感觉像个附加题
<4-47,Sheldon>That feels like a bonus question.

225
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:24,560
<4-47,Sheldon>见好就收啦  我好开心哦
<4-47,Sheldon>I'm gonna stop here while I'm ahead but I've had a great time.

271
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,960
<5-14,Leonard>但我不理解为什么不能在考察站

279
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:09,680
<6-5,Sheldon>因为在北极的严寒下
<6-5,Sheldon>Because in the frigid temperatures in the Arctic,

280

<6-5,Sheldon>我们每天至少要摄入5千卡路里

282
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:15,060
<6-6,Leonard>谢尔顿  你明知我不能吃黄油
<6-6,Leonard>Sheldon, you know I can't eat butter.

283
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:16,220
<6-6,Leonard>我会乳糖过敏
<6-6,Leonard>I'm lactose intolerant.

284

00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,160
<6-9,Mrs Koothrappali>我不管别人做什么
<6-9,Mrs Koothrappali>I don't care what the other guys are doing.

288
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:29,010
<6-9,Mrs Koothrappali>如果他们想要跳孟加拉湾 游泳去斯里兰卡
<6-9,Mrs Koothrappali>If the other guys jumped in the Bay of Bengal and tried to swim to Sri Lanka,

289
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:29,990
<6-9,Mrs Koothrappali>你也跟着去吗
<6-9,Mrs Koothrappali>would you follow them?

290
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:33,100
<6-10,Raj>你在我身后唠叨的话  我就跳
<6-10,Raj>If you were standing behind me nagging, I might.

291
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:35,350
<6-11,Dr Koothrappali>别跟你母亲顶嘴
<6-11,Dr Koothrappali>Don't talk back to your mother.

292
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:38,010
<6-11,Dr Koothrappali>这个太危险了  拉杰
<6-11,Dr Koothrappali>This trip is much too dangerous, Rajesh.

293
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:38,810
<6-12,Raj>不是的
<6-12,Raj>No, it's not.

294
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:39,930
<6-12,Raj>霍华德  告诉他们
<6-12,Raj>Howard, tell them.

295
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,610
<6-13,Howard>库萨帕里医生和夫人  你们好
<6-13,Howard>Doctor and Mrs. Koothrappali, namaste.

296
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,010
<6-13,Howard>我能理解你们的担心
<6-13,Howard>I understand your concern,

297
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:50,030
<6-13,Howard>如果能让你们感觉好一点 连我母亲都同意让我去呢
<6-13,Howard>but if it'll make you feel any better, my mother is fine with me going,

298
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:55,200
<6-13,Howard>她可是直到我17岁 才把我床上的安全栏拿掉
<6-13,Howard>and this is a woman who kept a safety rail on my bed until I was 17.

299
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:59,040
<6-14,Mrs Koothrappali>她不关心她儿子 会不会被海象吃掉?
<6-14,Mrs Koothrappali>So, she has no problem with her son being eaten by a walrus?

300
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,840
<6-15,Sheldon>这不可能  库萨帕里夫人
<6-15,Sheldon>That's very unlikely, Mrs. Koothrappali.

301
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,150
<6-15,Sheldon>如果拉杰死了
<6-15,Sheldon>If Raj dies,

302
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:05,080
<6-15,Sheldon>也只会因为冻伤  坏疽  严重晒伤
<6-15,Sheldon>it'll be from frostbite, gangrene, acute sunburn

303
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:09,020
<6-15,Sheldon>或者被1500磅重的北极熊撕成碎片
<6-15,Sheldon>or being ripped to shreds by a 1,500 pound polar bear.

304
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:12,980
<6-16,Howard>妈妈  我把你接到免提上 跟拉杰的父母通话
<6-16,Howard>Ma, I'm putting you on speakerphone with Raj's parents.

305
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:16,020
<6-16,Howard>您能告诉他们 您同意我去北极吗
<6-16,Howard>Can you tell them that you're okay with me going to the Arctic?

306
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:17,240
<6-17,Howard’s Mother>北极
<6-17,Howard’s Mother>Arctic?!

307
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:21,050
<6-17,Howard’s Mother>我以为你说的是阿肯色州
<6-17,Howard’s Mother>I thought you said Arkansas!

308
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,700
<6-18,Howard>我没那么说
<6-18,Howard>I didn't say that.

309
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,080
<6-18,Howard>你从来都不仔细听
<6-18,Howard>You never listen to me!

310
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:26,150
<6-19,Howard’s Mother>他什么都不告诉我
<6-19,Howard’s Mother>He doesn't tell me anything!

311
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:30,290
<6-19,Howard’s Mother>他就知道自惭形秽  苟且偷生
<6-19,Howard’s Mother>He lives a secret life because he's ashamed!

312
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,550
<6-20,Penny (arriving)>莱纳德  能跟你谈谈吗
<6-20,Penny (arriving)>Hey, Leonard, can I talk to you for a sec?

313
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:38,310
<6-21,Leonard>当然  去外面说吧 那里少一些尖叫和罪恶
<6-21,Leonard>Sure, but let's go out here where there's a little less yelling and guilt.

314
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,120
<6-21,Leonard>怎么了
<6-21,Leonard>What's up?

315
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:42,580
<6-22,Penny>我给你准备了一份送别礼物
<6-22,Penny>Well, I got you a little going away present.

316
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:44,390
<6-23,Leonard>毯子啊
<6-23,Leonard>Oh, a blanket.

317
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:45,900
<6-24,Penny>不对  不只是毯子
<6-24,Penny>Oh, no, no, no, not just a blanket.

318
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:49,780
<6-24,Penny>看见没  还有袖子呢
<6-24,Penny>See, it has sleeves.

319
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:57,800
<6-24,Penny>这样你就能蜷在里面
<6-24,Penny>So, you can, you know, be all snoodled up

320
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,140
<6-24,Penny>搞你的科研了
<6-24,Penny>while you do your science stuff.

321
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:03,020
<6-25,Leonard>酷啊
<6-25,Leonard>Oh, wow, cool.

322
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,420
<6-26,Penny>我会想你的
<6-26,Penny>Oh, I'm gonna miss you.

323
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,010
<6-26,Penny>-回见  -再见
<6-26,Penny>- See you later. - Bye.

324
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:22,160
<6-28,Mrs Koothrappali>跟你说了  没有
<6-28,Mrs Koothrappali>I told you no!

325
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,600
<6-28,Mrs Koothrappali>为什么不信我
<6-28,Mrs Koothrappali>Why don't you believe me?

326
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:26,460
<6-29,Howard’s Mother>因为我无法理解
<6-29,Howard’s Mother>'Cause it doesn't make sense to me!

327
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:29,490
<6-29,Howard’s Mother>印度这么大一个国家
<6-29,Howard’s Mother>How can it be that in the entire country of India,

328
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:32,020
<6-29,Howard’s Mother>怎么会连一家澳美客牛排坊都没有
<6-29,Howard’s Mother>there isn't one Outback Steakhouse?!

329
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,170
<7-1,Leonard>谢尔顿  谢尔顿
<7-1,Leonard>Sheldon... Sheldon?

330
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:44,540
<7-2,Sheldon>奶奶  我要吃饼干
<7-2,Sheldon>I want a cookie, Meemaw.

331
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:48,210
<7-3,Leonard>谢尔顿  是我
<7-3,Leonard>Sheldon, it's me.

332
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,750
<7-4,Sheldon>但是奶奶刚刚做了饼干
<7-4,Sheldon>But Meemaw just made cookies.

333
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:55,420
<7-5,Leonard>我不知道该不该参加这次科考
<7-5,Leonard>Listen, I don't know if I can go on the expedition.

334
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:57,880
<7-6,Sheldon>什么
<7-6,Sheldon>What?

335
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:59,660
<7-7,Leonard>我觉得我不能去北极
<7-7,Leonard>I don't think I can go to the North Pole.

336
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:01,460
<7-8,Sheldon>莱纳德
<7-8,Sheldon>Okay, Leonard,

337
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:04,460
<7-8,Sheldon>我明白 你怕我会失望
<7-8,Sheldon>I know you're concerned about disappointing me

338
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:07,050
<7-8,Sheldon>但我希望你能得到些许安慰
<7-8,Sheldon>but I want you to take comfort from the knowledge

339
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,500
<7-8,Sheldon>我对你的期望值其实非常低
<7-8,Sheldon>that my expectations of you are very low.

340
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:13,490
<7-9,Leonard>确实很安慰人
<7-9,Leonard>Yeah, that's very comforting.

341
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,360
<7-10,Sheldon>安慰队员是领导的职务
<7-10,Sheldon>Comforting is a part of leadership.

342
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:18,510
<7-10,Sheldon>我虽不在意  但仍然是我的负担
<7-10,Sheldon>It's not a part I care for, but such is my burden.

343
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:22,330
<7-11,Leonard>不错  只是我觉得佩妮不想让我走
<7-11,Leonard>Terrific, it's just that I don't think Penny wants me to go.

344
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:26,570
<7-12,Sheldon>假设这是不去的正当理由  实际上不是
<7-12,Sheldon>Assuming that's a valid reason not to go, which it isn't,

345
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,790
<7-12,Sheldon>你怎么知道呢 是她说的么
<7-12,Sheldon>how do you know this? Did she say it?

346
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,600
<7-13,Leonard>不完全是吧
<7-13,Leonard>Not exactly.

347
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,480
<7-13,Leonard>但是她说她会想我  还送这个给我
<7-13,Leonard>But she said she was gonna miss me and she gave me this.

348
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,780
<7-14,Sheldon>什么东西
<7-14,Sheldon>What is it?

349
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:40,160
<7-15,Leonard>带袖子的毛毯
<7-15,Leonard>It's a blanket with sleeves.

350
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:43,250
<7-16,Sheldon>真聪明的设计
<7-16,Sheldon>Oh, that's clever.

351
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,900
<7-16,Sheldon>看看我是否正确理解了
<7-16,Sheldon>Let me see if I understand this correctly.

352
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:52,190
<7-16,Sheldon>她想念你  是你非常向往的 情感状态
<7-16,Sheldon>Her missing you is an emotional state you find desirable?

353
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:54,430
<7-17,Leonard>-当然啦  -那行
<7-17,Leonard>- Yes, obviously. - All right.

354
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:58,280
<7-18,Sheldon>但是她想念你是建立在你要离开的基础上的
<7-18,Sheldon>Well, given that missing you is predicated on you leaving,

355
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,820
<7-18,Sheldon>从逻辑上讲  你必须去
<7-18,Sheldon>logic dictates you must leave.

356
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:06,090
<7-19,Leonard>话虽如此  但这一去就是三个月啊
<7-19,Leonard>Yes, okay, but I'm gonna be gone for three months.

357
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,150
<7-19,Leonard>要是她不再想我了  另觅新欢怎么办
<7-19,Leonard>What if she doesn't miss me that long and she meets someone else?

358
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:13,130
<7-20,Sheldon>她的注意广度[注意力集中时长]确实比较短
<7-20,Sheldon>She does have a short attention span.

359
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:14,370
<7-21,Leonard>所以说  我不能去
<7-21,Leonard>So, I can't go.

360
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,610
<7-22,Sheldon>莱纳德  也许你是对的
<7-22,Sheldon>Leonard, you may be right.

361
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,450
<7-22,Sheldon>看来佩妮暗中表现出
<7-22,Sheldon>It appears that Penny secretly wants you

362
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:21,610
<7-22,Sheldon>想跟你发生亲密肉体接触的欲望
<7-22,Sheldon>in her life in a very intimate and carnal fashion.

363
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:23,740
<7-23,Leonard>你真的这样想?
<7-23,Leonard>You really think so?

364
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:25,480
<7-24,Sheldon>当然不是
<7-24,Sheldon>Of course not.

365
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,950
<7-24,Sheldon>即使处于失眠状态  我都可以
<7-24,Sheldon>Even in my sleep-deprived state, I've managed to

366
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:33,170
<7-24,Sheldon>成功上演另一出经典恶作剧
<7-24,Sheldon>pull off another one of my classic pranks.

367
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,520
<7-24,Sheldon>气死你
<7-24,Sheldon>Bazinga!

368
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:45,530
<8-1,Penny>莱纳德  几点了
<8-1,Penny>Oh, Leonard, what time is it?

369
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,250
<8-2,Leonard>早晨七点  抱歉这么早打扰你
<8-2,Leonard>It's 7:00 a.m. I'm sorry it's early,

370
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:49,480
<8-2,Leonard>但我们马上就出发了  我想跟你谈谈
<8-2,Leonard>but we're leaving soon, and I needed to talk to you.

371
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,020
<8-3,Penny>好
<8-3,Penny>Okay.

372
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:54,640
<8-4,Leonard>你说你会想我  是什么意思
<8-4,Leonard>What did you mean when you said you're going to miss me?

373
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,760
<8-5,Penny>不知道
<8-5,Penny>Um, I don't know.

374
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:01,270
<8-5,Penny>你离开了  我会发现嘛
<8-5,Penny>You'll be gone and I'll notice.

375
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:05,190
<8-6,Leonard (indicating the blanket)>那这个呢
<8-6,Leonard (indicating the blanket)>Okay, well, um, what about this?

376
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,570
<8-6,Leonard (indicating the blanket)>什么意思
<8-6,Leonard (indicating the blanket)>What does this mean?

377
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:12,120
<8-7,Penny>酗酒  乱刷卡和熬夜看电视 都没啥好处
<8-7,Penny>Wine, credit card and late night television are a bad combination.

378
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:14,780
<8-8,Leonard>好吧
<8-8,Leonard>All right, fine.

379
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:16,720
<8-8,Leonard>那个长长的拥抱呢
<8-8,Leonard>What about that really long hug?

380
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:17,860
<8-8,Leonard>那又是什么意思
<8-8,Leonard>What did that mean?

381
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,330
<8-9,Penny>不算长长的拥抱呀
<8-9,Penny>That wasn't a long hug.

382
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,370
<8-10,Leonard>至少持续了五秒钟
<8-10,Leonard>It was at least five Mississippis.

383
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:29,830
<8-10,Leonard>一般拥抱不超过两秒钟
<8-10,Leonard>A standard hug is two Mississippis tops.

384
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:32,820
<8-11,Penny>莱纳德  我不知道有什么可说的
<8-11,Penny>Leonard, I don't know what to tell you.

385
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:34,200
<8-11,Penny>就是个拥抱嘛
<8-11,Penny>It was just a hug.

386
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:36,340
<8-12,Leonard>很高兴交待清楚了
<8-12,Leonard>Glad we cleared that up.

387
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:37,870

392
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:52,640
<8-17,Penny>意思是舍不得你走
<8-17,Penny>It means I wish you weren't going.

393
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,360
<9-1,Leonard>该死
<9-1,Leonard>Damn it.

394

395
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:07,550
<9-3,Leonard>冰用完了

00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,580
<9-4,Sheldon>我建议你们 尽量别捣乱
<9-4,Sheldon>I suggest you keep the shenanigans to a minimum

401
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:22,870

<9-7,Leonard>How about we take a moment to think about

406
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,010
<9-7,Leonard>我们所在的位置

407
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:37,170
<9-7,Leonard>这算是 世界之巅了
<9-7,Leonard>This is literally the top of the world.
