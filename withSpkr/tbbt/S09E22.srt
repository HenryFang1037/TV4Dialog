1
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,040
<1-1,Penny>你们这周末要是有空
<1-1,Penny>Oh, hey, if you guys are free this weekend,

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,380
<1-1,Penny>公司奖给我一晚品酒之夜  一起去啊
<1-1,Penny>I won a night of wine tasting from work.

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:08,560
<1-2,Leonard>听起来挺有意思啊
<1-2,Leonard>That sounds fun.

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,930
<1-4,Leonard>为什么科学家不像销售员有免费东西拿呢
<1-4,Leonard>How come scientists don't win free stuff like salespeople do?

5
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:13,780
<1-5,Howard>我们投身科学界不是为了得到东西
<1-5,Howard>'Cause we're not in it for the stuff.

6
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,550
<1-5,Howard>而是为了能泡粉丝
<1-5,Howard>We're in it for the groupies.

7
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,100
<1-6,Sheldon>我个人呢
<1-6,Sheldon>Personally,

8
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,720
<1-6,Sheldon>觉得外在奖励挺有损人格
<1-6,Sheldon>I find the notion of external rewards demeaning.

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,360
<1-6,Sheldon>我投身科学是为了科学发现所带来的欢乐
<1-6,Sheldon>I pursue science for the intrinsic joy of discovery.

10
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,570
<1-7,Amy>但你不是总念叨着要赢个诺贝尔奖吗
<1-7,Amy>But you always say that you want to win a Nobel Prize.

11
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,660
<1-8,Sheldon>我也念叨过不要在我朋友面前吐槽我
<1-8,Sheldon>I also say don't contradict me in front of my friends,

12
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,850
<1-8,Sheldon>这你丫怎么就没记得呢
<1-8,Sheldon>but that you don't remember.

13
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:33,610
<1-9,Penny>好了  你们想去的话就告诉我
<1-9,Penny>All right, well, let me know if you guys want to go.

14
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:34,820
<1-10,Raj>我愿意
<1-10,Raj>I would love to.

15
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:37,920
<1-10,Raj>我就很享受陈酿黑皮诺红酒富有层次的口感
<1-10,Raj>I do enjoy the complexity of an aged Pinot noir.

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,360
<1-11,Leonard>我相信那红酒一定很搭
<1-11,Leonard>I'm sure that would pair nicely

17
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,960
<1-11,Leonard>你这份炸鸡块
<1-11,Leonard>with your fried nuggets of chicken.

18
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:44,930
<1-12,Amy>听起来会很棒  我们应该去
<1-12,Amy>Well, it sounds like a nice night. We should go.

19
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:46,480
<1-13,Sheldon>又是酒吗
<1-13,Sheldon>Wine again?

20
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,420
<1-13,Sheldon>不用了  谢谢
<1-13,Sheldon>Yeah, no, thank you.

21
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,310
<1-13,Sheldon>我喜欢传统的享用葡萄方式
<1-13,Sheldon>I like my grapes the old-fashioned way:

22
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:51,300
<1-13,Sheldon>就是果汁盒
<1-13,Sheldon>in a juice box.

23
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:52,840
<1-14,Amy>我就要去
<1-14,Amy>Well, I'm going.

24
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,240
<1-14,Amy>我在商场时  你就阻止不了我去按摩
<1-14,Amy>You couldn't stop me from getting a massage at the mall,

25
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,820
<1-14,Amy>现在也别想阻止我
<1-14,Amy>and you're not stopping me now.

26
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,630
<1-15,Sheldon>我为什么要眼睁睁看我女朋友
<1-15,Sheldon>I shouldn't have to see my girlfriend

27
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:01,280
<1-15,Sheldon>在公共场合被别的男人"上下其手"啊
<1-15,Sheldon>get groped in public by another man.

28
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,900
<1-16,Amy>我又为什么要眼睁睁看我男朋友
<1-16,Amy>And I shouldn't have to see my boyfriend

29
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:06,200
<1-16,Amy>坐商场里给小孩玩的小火车啊
<1-16,Amy>riding on a train for children around the mall.

30
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:08,920
<1-17,Penny>给儿童坐的那种迷你火车吗
<1-17,Penny>The little choo-choo for toddlers?

31
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,800
<1-18,Amy>所以你知道我为什么需要找人按摩了吗
<1-18,Amy>And now you know why I needed the massage.

32
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,440
<1-19,Howard>我们不去
<1-19,Howard>Well, we're out.

33
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,650
<1-19,Howard>妮妮怀孕了  不能喝酒
<1-19,Howard>Bernie can't drink 'cause she's pregnant.

34
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:17,690
<1-19,Howard>而她会怀孕  是因为我们滚床单了
<1-19,Howard>And she's pregnant because we had sex.

35
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:19,000
<1-19,Howard>而我们会滚床单是因为...
<1-19,Howard>And we had sex because...

36
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,720
<1-19,Howard>这还用说吗
<1-19,Howard>well, come on.

37
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,010
<1-20,Bernadette>没事的  你跟他们去吧
<1-20,Bernadette>It's okay. You should go.

38
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:25,850
<1-21,Howard>你确定吗
<1-21,Howard>You sure?

39
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:26,770
<1-22,Bernadette>当然啦
<1-22,Bernadette>Of course.

40
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:31,270
<1-23,Penny>对啊  让她耳根清净  远离"这还用说吗"
<1-23,Penny>Yeah, give her a break from, "Well, come on."

41
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,920
<1-24,Sheldon>妮妮  看来周六晚是你跟我二人时光了
<1-24,Sheldon>Well, Bernadette, looks like Saturday night, it's you and me.

42
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,230
<1-25,Bernadette>我吗  怎么  凭啥
<1-25,Bernadette>Me? How? Why?

43
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:39,240
<1-26,Sheldon>这很有道理啊
<1-26,Sheldon>Well, it makes perfect sense.

44
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,050
<1-26,Sheldon>因为你身怀六甲  所以不能喝酒
<1-26,Sheldon>Because you're an expectant mother, you can't drink alcohol.

45
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:42,940
<2-2,Leonard>我是不喜欢喝
<2-2,Leonard>I don't like to.

46
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,250
<1-26,Sheldon>怀孕不能吃寿司生鱼片
<1-26,Sheldon>You can't have sushi.

47
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,290
<2-2,Leonard>我是不喜欢吃
<2-2,Leonard>I don't like to.

48
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:46,900
<1-26,Sheldon>怀孕不能进浴缸泡热水澡
<1-26,Sheldon>You can't go in hot tubs.

49
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:50,870
<1-26,Sheldon>而我觉得那是一桶人们的汗水汤
<1-26,Sheldon>I consider them vats of sweaty people soup.

50
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:53,200
<1-27,Bernadette>谢尔顿  我不知道...
<1-27,Bernadette>Gee, Sheldon, I don't know.

51
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,370
<1-28,Sheldon>别怕啦
<1-28,Sheldon>Oh, come on.

52
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:56,890
<1-28,Sheldon>过山车  咖啡因  半熟的蛋
<1-28,Sheldon>Roller coasters, caffeine, runny eggs--

53
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:58,770
<1-28,Sheldon>我这辈子一直都在避开这些东西
<1-28,Sheldon>I've been avoiding these things all my life.

54
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:01,720
<1-28,Sheldon>而你现在怀孕了  你不避开这些都不行
<1-28,Sheldon>And now, because you're pregnant, you have to.

55
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,170
<1-29,Leonard>但你们的差别是  她是为世界带来生命
<1-29,Leonard>The difference is she's bringing life into the world,

56
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:06,510
<1-29,Leonard>而你是带走生命力
<1-29,Leonard>and you suck it out.

57
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:09,270
<1-30,Bernadette>我们就试试一起玩吧
<1-30,Bernadette>I guess we could give it a try.

58
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,570
<1-31,Sheldon>小姑娘  听过用心派对吧
<1-31,Sheldon>Well, little lady, you've heard of party hearty;

59
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:14,150
<1-31,Sheldon>准备迎接"无心"派对吧
<1-31,Sheldon>get ready to party hardly.

60
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:18,220
<1-32,Howard>我猜你现在一定超想来一杯
<1-32,Howard>I bet you'd like a drink right now.

61
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:28,130
<1-32,Howard>翻译：后宫佳丽三千赛   家有爱宠三只猫
<1-32,Howard>猫王进入倒计时  别扭大菜

71
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:47,500
<2-1,Raj>你们会介意
<2-1,Raj>Hey, you think it'd be okay

72
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,070
<2-1,Raj>我带克莱尔去参加品酒吗
<2-1,Raj>if I brought Claire to the wine tasting?

73
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,860
<2-2,Leonard>-可以啊  我也想见她  -那太好了
<2-2,Leonard>- Sure. I'd like to meet her. - Oh, that's great.

74
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,250
<2-3,Raj>我也想带她见见大家好久了
<2-3,Raj>I've been wanting her to meet you guys, too,

75
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,270
<2-3,Raj>感觉这次是个很完美的好时机
<2-3,Raj>so this seems like the perfect opportunity.

76
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:55,680
<2-4,Sheldon>但是我不会在场啊
<2-4,Sheldon>Oh, but I won't be there.

77
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,710
<2-5,Raj>真是无巧不成书啊
<2-5,Raj>Funny how that worked out.

78
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:00,930
<2-6,Leonard>所以这代表艾米丽已经宣告出局了吗
<2-6,Leonard>Does this mean Emily's not in the picture anymore?

79
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,360
<2-7,Raj>没有啊  我们还会约会
<2-7,Raj>No, I'm still dating her.

80
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,570
<2-8,Leonard>大神为我指点迷津
<2-8,Leonard>Okay, help me out.

81
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:04,650
<2-8,Leonard>你是怎么做到脚踏两条船
<2-8,Leonard>How are you doing this?

82
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,000
<2-8,Leonard>她们知道彼此的存在吗
<2-8,Leonard>Do they know about each other?

83
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,560
<2-9,Raj>她们都知道我与她们不是专属的关系
<2-9,Raj>They know that we're not exclusive,

84
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,310
<2-9,Raj>所以我们就彼此不要问太多问题就好
<2-9,Raj>and we just don't ask too many questions.

85
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:13,220
<2-10,Sheldon>就像我跟你玩"卡亚战神"卡牌游戏
<2-10,Sheldon>You know, it's like how I play Warlords of Ka'a with you

86
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:16,740
<2-10,Sheldon>而跟法兰克与艾丽西娅玩《远古封印》
<2-10,Sheldon>and Elder Sign with Frank and Alicia.

87
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:19,530
<2-11,Leonard>法兰克与艾丽西娅是谁啊
<2-11,Leonard>Who's Frank and Alicia?

88
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,780
<2-12,Sheldon>我们相处时间已经够长了
<2-12,Sheldon>Y... You and I spend a lot of time together.

89
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,590
<2-12,Sheldon>我们之间就不能有些小秘密吗
<2-12,Sheldon>Can there be a little mystery between us?

90
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,500
<2-12,Sheldon>好了
<2-12,Sheldon>Okay.

91
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,260
<2-13,Howard>线路什么的都接好了  准备好啦
<2-13,Howard>Everything's hooked up. We're ready.

92
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,840
<2-14,Sheldon>我要为后人们录下这一刻
<2-14,Sheldon>I am going to record this for posterity.

93
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,230
<2-15,Leonard>好了  去吧  就决定是你了
<2-15,Leonard>All right, here goes nothing.

94
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,950
<2-15,Leonard>还"去吧  就决定是你了"呢
<2-15,Leonard>Here goes nothing?

95
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:35,700
<2-16,Sheldon>这是我们原型的首次测试
<2-16,Sheldon>This is the initial test of our prototype.

96
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,650
<2-16,Sheldon>能不能用词正式大气一点
<2-16,Sheldon>Can we give it a little more gravitas?

97
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:38,660
<2-17,Leonard>行
<2-17,Leonard>Fine.

98
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:41,100
<2-17,Leonard>无限持续陀螺仪导向系统
<2-17,Leonard>Preliminary trial of the infinite persistence

99
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:44,410
<2-17,Leonard>初步实验:  第一阶段开始
<2-17,Leonard>gyroscopic navigational system: phase one commencing.

100
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:45,880
<2-18,Sheldon>可能是你声线的问题
<2-18,Sheldon>Eh... maybe it's your voice.

101
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:50,880
<2-18,Sheldon>我看看能不能找詹姆斯·厄尔·琼斯配音吧
<2-18,Sheldon>I'm gonna see if I can get James Earl Jones to do it in post.

103
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,010
<2-19,Raj>太  太美了
<2-19,Raj>It's... it's-it's beautiful.

104
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,220
<2-20,Howard>其实我看得有点头晕了
<2-20,Howard>Actually, it's making me dizzy.

105
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,280
<2-21,Leonard>太好了  原来不止我一个
<2-21,Leonard>Good, it's not just me.

106
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:13,950
<3-1,Claire (on phone)>您好
<3-1,Claire (on phone)>Hello.

107
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:14,920
<3-2,Raj>克莱尔  是我
<3-2,Raj>Hey, Claire.

108
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,970
<3-3,Claire>怎么啦
<3-3,Claire>Hey, what's up?

109
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:16,890
<3-4,Raj>是这样的
<3-4,Raj>Hi, yeah.

110
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,150
<3-4,Raj>我在想
<3-4,Raj>Um, I was wondering,

111
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:20,590
<3-4,Raj>如果你周六晚有空
<3-4,Raj>if you're free Saturday night,

112
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:22,910
<3-4,Raj>我的小伙伴们要一起去品酒之夜
<3-4,Raj>all my friends are going to a wine tasting.

113
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:25,000
<3-5,Claire>好啊  可以吧
<3-5,Claire>Sure, I guess.

114
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,150
<3-5,Claire>你不觉得我见你的朋友们进展太快就行
<3-5,Claire>If you don't think meeting your friends is too big a step.

115
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:30,510
<3-6,Raj>为什么这会算进展太快呢
<3-6,Raj>Why would it be too big a step?

116
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:33,830
<3-7,Claire>不知道啊  我不想事情发展得奇怪
<3-7,Claire>I don't know. I just don't want things to get weird.

117
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,590
<3-8,Raj>没什么好担心的啦
<3-8,Raj>Nothing to worry about.

118
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:37,820
<3-8,Raj>人生就是不断地认识新的人
<3-8,Raj>People meet people all the time,

119
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,480
<3-8,Raj>怎么会奇怪
<3-8,Raj>and it isn't weird.

120
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,720
<3-8,Raj>我见过歌手邦·乔飞  你可能觉得会很怪
<3-8,Raj>I met Bon Jovi once, which you'd think might be weird.

121
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,600
<3-8,Raj>但结果呢  人家好得不得了
<3-8,Raj>Turns out, total sweetheart.

122
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:49,460
<3-9,Claire>但我们一直处于顺其自然的状态
<3-9,Claire>Okay, but you and I have been keeping things casual.

123
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,150
<3-9,Claire>所以你会跟朋友介绍我是你的朋友
<3-9,Claire>Uh, will you introduce me as your friend

124
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:52,680
<3-9,Claire>还是女朋友呢
<3-9,Claire>or as your girlfriend?

125
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,790
<3-9,Claire>万一我喜欢他们
<3-9,Claire>What if I like them

126
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:54,970
<3-9,Claire>他们不喜欢我怎么办
<3-9,Claire>and they don't like me?

127
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:57,750
<3-9,Claire>万一他们喜欢我  我不喜欢他们怎么办

<7-27,Leonard>最酷的是它可以永久性地
<7-27,Leonard>What's neat is that they can maintain

248
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,400
<7-27,Leonard>保持角动量
<7-27,Leonard>angular momentum indefinitely.

249
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,150
<7-28,Zack>角动量
<7-28,Zack>Angular momentum.

250
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:45,280
<7-28,Zack>我正好也在想这个问题呢
<7-28,Zack>I was wondering about that.

251
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,750
<7-29,Howard>它可以安置在卫星或火箭上
<7-29,Howard>You could put it in a satellite or a rocket,

252
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,280
<7-29,Howard>就可以永久运行
<7-29,Howard>and it'll run forever.

253
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,630
<7-29,Howard>很酷嘛
<7-29,Howard>Cool.

254
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:55,630
<7-30,Zack>那它可以应用在导弹或者其他武器上吗
<7-30,Zack>Could it be used for missiles and war stuff?

255
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:58,430
<7-31,Howard>当然可以  但我们发明它不是为了制造武器
<7-31,Howard>Yeah, but we didn't create it for weapons.

256
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:00,020
<7-32,Leonard>我也怀疑军方会不会对
<7-32,Leonard>And I doubt the military would be interested

257
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,800
<7-32,Leonard>我们这小小的导向系统感兴趣
<7-32,Leonard>in our little guidance system.

258
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,070
<7-33,Zack>这玩意能比得上他们现在的技术吗
<7-33,Zack>Is it better than the one they use now?

259
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:05,170
<7-35,Leonard>-好太多了  -甩他们几条街
<7-35,Leonard>- A lot! - Way better.

260
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,220
<7-36,Zack>你们这群家伙真的智商超群吗
<7-36,Zack>You sure you guys are smart?

261
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:19,760
<8-1,Sheldon>H-O级别的火车是1/87比例的
<8-1,Sheldon>"H-O" gauge trains are 1/87 scale.

262
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,940
<8-1,Sheldon>N级别的火车是1/160比例的
<8-1,Sheldon>"N" gauge are 1/160 scale.

263
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,980
<8-1,Sheldon>另外还有Z级别的火车
<8-1,Sheldon>And that brings us to "Z" gauge, at a

264
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:27,790
<8-1,Sheldon>它的比例大小为"可随口吞下  别问我怎么知道"
<8-1,Sheldon>"you could easily swallow it, don't ask how I know,"

265
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:30,200
<8-1,Sheldon>1/220
<8-1,Sheldon>1/220.

266
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,310
<8-2,Bernadette>抱歉  我还是想问一下
<8-2,Bernadette>I'm sorry, I have to ask.

267
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:35,480
<8-3,Sheldon>我五岁的时候   吞下了一个Z级别的火车头
<8-3,Sheldon>When I was five, I ingested a "Z" gauge locomotive.

268
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,810
<8-3,Sheldon>接下来的三天我一直默念着  "顺利出洞
<8-3,Sheldon>I spent the next three days saying, "I think I can pass it,

269
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:40,730
<8-3,Sheldon>顺利出洞  顺利出洞"
<8-3,Sheldon>I think I can pass it, I think I can pass it."

270
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:45,270
<8-4,Bernadette>你为什么这么喜欢火车呢
<8-4,Bernadette>What is it about trains that you like so much?

271
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,880
<8-5,Sheldon>这个问题问得好
<8-5,Sheldon>What an interesting question.

272
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,020
<8-5,Sheldon>小时候  生活对我来说
<8-5,Sheldon>When I was a child, life was confusing

273
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:54,140
<8-5,Sheldon>无序又复杂  火车则代表了一种秩序
<8-5,Sheldon>and chaotic for me, and trains represented order.

274
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:58,300
<8-5,Sheldon>我可以排列  分类  控制火车
<8-5,Sheldon>I could line them up, categorize them, control them.

275
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,800
<8-5,Sheldon>可以说  在这个纷乱的世界中
<8-5,Sheldon>I guess you could say that

276
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,720
<8-5,Sheldon>只有火车才能带给我一丝平静
<8-5,Sheldon>they gave me a sense of calm in a world that didn't.

277
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,220
<8-6,Bernadette>真有爱  谢尔顿
<8-6,Bernadette>That's lovely, Sheldon.

278
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,820
<8-7,Sheldon>除了它们会在你肠道里嚓嘎前进之外
<8-7,Sheldon>Well... other than when they're chugging through your bowels,

279
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,820
<8-7,Sheldon>火车真是最棒的了
<8-7,Sheldon>these things are magic.

280
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:14,560
<9-1,Leonard>我必须承认  从一开始
<9-1,Leonard>I have to admit, I've been worried about

281
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,610
<9-1,Leonard>我对技术被用到军事用途的事就很担心
<9-1,Leonard>the military applications since we started talking about this.

282
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,000
<9-2,Howard>我也是
<9-2,Howard>Me, too.

283
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,610
<9-3,Leonard>那你怎么不说出来
<9-3,Leonard>Why didn't you say something?

284
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:22,830
<9-4,Howard>就像我从来不提菊花癌一样
<9-4,Howard>Same reason I don't talk about ass cancer.

285
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:25,120
<9-4,Howard>这个话题可不怎么愉快
<9-4,Howard>It's not a pleasant topic.

286
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:27,110
<9-5,Raj>你们不能就此放弃啊
<9-5,Raj>You can't let this stop you.

287
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:29,320
<9-5,Raj>几乎所有的科学发展都可以
<9-5,Raj>Almost any scientific advancement can be used

288
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,860
<9-5,Raj>应用在破坏性的目的上
<9-5,Raj>for destructive purposes.

289
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:33,170
<9-6,Amy>没错  就连爱因斯坦的相对论
<9-6,Amy>It's true. Even Einstein's theory of relativity

290
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:35,770
<9-6,Amy>后来也应用在了核武器的研发上
<9-6,Amy>was later applied to the development of nuclear weapons.

291
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:37,720
<9-7,Penny>E = mc2
<9-7,Penny>E equals MC squared.

292
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,780
<9-7,Penny>没错
<9-7,Penny>Yeah.

293
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,350
<9-7,Penny>E表示能量  M代表质量
<9-7,Penny>"E" is for energy, "M" for mass,

294
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:42,070
<9-7,Penny>C表示光速
<9-7,Penny>and "C" for the speed of light.

295
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,650
<9-8,Amy>你怎么懂这个
<9-8,Amy>How do you know that?

296
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:49,330
<9-9,Penny>莱纳德每次拖延射精时间时就念叨这个
<9-9,Penny>Oh, Leonard mumbles it when he wants sex to last longer.

297
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,220
<9-10,Claire>拉杰
<9-10,Claire>Hey, Raj.

298
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,450
<9-10,Claire>克莱尔  你来了
<9-10,Claire>Hey, Claire. Good, you're here.

299
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:56,870
<9-11,Raj>各位  这是我朋友克莱尔
<9-11,Raj>Guys, this is my friend Claire.

300
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:59,010
<9-11,Raj>我们只是顺其自然的交往而已
<9-11,Raj>We're casually dating, and there's no need

301
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,170
<9-11,Raj>请大家不要再问问题
<9-11,Raj>for any further questions about it.

302
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:04,540
<9-12,Leonard>你要来杯酒吗
<9-12,Leonard>Would you like a glass of wine?

303
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,300
<9-13,Raj>人家说了不要问
<9-13,Raj>I said no questions!

304
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:11,020
<10-1,Sheldon>最后也是同样重要的一点
<10-1,Sheldon>And last but not least,

305
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:15,160
<10-1,Sheldon>我喜欢把这个叫做星球大战吐司
<10-1,Sheldon>this is one that I like to call Star Wars Toast because...

306
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:19,150
<10-1,Sheldon>因为它兼具了"光明"和"黑暗"两面
<10-1,Sheldon>it has a light side and a dark side.

307
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,180
<10-1,Sheldon>好了  到了玩《龙与地下城》游戏的时候
<10-1,Sheldon>All righty, it's time for Dungeons & Dragons!

308
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,710
<10-2,Bernadette>《龙与地下城》
<10-2,Bernadette>Dungeons & Dragons.

309
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:28,850
<10-2,Bernadette>真是不意外
<10-2,Bernadette>That sounds about right.

310
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:30,650
<10-3,Sheldon>你肯定会喜欢这游戏的
<10-3,Sheldon>You're gonna enjoy this.

311
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,780
<10-3,Sheldon>我是专门为你设计的版本
<10-3,Sheldon>I designed it especially for you.

312
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,400
<10-4,Bernadette>好  但我只玩一小会就好
<10-4,Bernadette>Okay, but just for a little bit.

313
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,490
<10-5,Sheldon>我有预感  一旦你开始玩了
<10-5,Sheldon>Oh, I have a feeling that once you start,

314
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:39,480
<10-5,Sheldon>一定会乐此不疲  根本停不下来
<10-5,Sheldon>you're not gonna want to or be allowed to stop.

315
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:40,930
<10-6,Bernadette>好吧
<10-6,Bernadette>All right.

316
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,070
<10-7,Sheldon>准备好了吗
<10-7,Sheldon>Ready?

317
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:44,050
<10-8,Bernadette>好了
<10-8,Bernadette>You bet.

318
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:47,400
<10-9,Sheldon>你名叫博纳特克斯
<10-9,Sheldon>Your name is Bernatrix.

319
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,030
<10-9,Sheldon>你是一名战士女皇
<10-9,Sheldon>You are a warrior queen.

320
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:52,290
<10-9,Sheldon>你人高马大  美艳绝伦
<10-9,Sheldon>You're strong, beautiful and tall.

321
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,880
<10-10,Bernadette>我喜欢人高这个设定
<10-10,Bernadette>I like the idea of being tall.

322
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,640
<10-11,Sheldon>我还有好多你肯定喜欢的东西呢
<10-11,Sheldon>I think you're gonna like a lot of things I have in store.

323
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,590
<10-11,Sheldon>比如  在这个世界里  只有男人才会怀孕
<10-11,Sheldon>For example, in this world, only the men get pregnant,

324
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:04,860
<10-11,Sheldon>所以你老公正在家苦练不要一笑就尿
<10-11,Sheldon>so your husband is home trying not to pee when he laughs.

325
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:07,150
<10-12,Bernadette>有意思  然后呢
<10-12,Bernadette>This is getting fun. What's next?

326
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:09,750
<10-13,Sheldon>你结束了战斗  又渴又累
<10-13,Sheldon>You're parched and weary from battle.

327
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,890
<10-13,Sheldon>你来到了一家酒馆面前
<10-13,Sheldon>You stand in front of a tavern that serves the coldest,

328
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:15,750
<10-13,Sheldon>这里有全世界最好喝最冰的麦芽酒
<10-13,Sheldon>most delicious ale in all the realm.

329
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,750
<10-14,Bernadette>我好几个月没喝酒了
<10-14,Bernadette>Oh, I haven't had a drink in months.

330
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,000
<10-15,Sheldon>你会怎么做
<10-15,Sheldon>What do you do?

331
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,300
<10-16,Bernadette>我如狂风般冲进去  丢下我的宝剑
<10-16,Bernadette>I storm in, slam my sword down,

332
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,010
<10-16,Bernadette>说  "小二  给老娘把最烈的麦芽酒
<10-16,Bernadette>and say, "Barkeep, bring me the strongest ale you have

333
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:27,080
<10-16,Bernadette>装在哥布林妖精的头骨里端上来"
<10-16,Bernadette>and serve it in the skull of a Goblin!"

334
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,060
<10-17,Sheldon>小二要求查看你的身份证
<10-17,Sheldon>He wants to see I.D.

335
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:38,770
<11-1,Amy>克莱尔  我们听了很多关于你的好话呢
<11-1,Amy>So, Claire, we've heard so many wonderful things about you.

336
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:41,490
<11-2,Claire>真的吗  什么好话
<11-2,Claire>Really? Like what?

337
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,570
<11-3,Amy>大部分都是佩妮听说的
<11-3,Amy>Uh, mostly Penny's heard them.

338
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:49,860
<11-4,Zack>你过去要加冰块时
<11-4,Zack>Boy, you get some dirty looks over there

339
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,820
<11-4,Zack>会有不少鄙视眼光传来啊
<11-4,Zack>when you ask for ice.

340
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:55,060
<11-5,Raj>扎克  这是我朋友克莱尔
<11-5,Raj>Zack, this is my friend Claire.

341
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,650
<11-6,Zack>你真漂亮  有对象吗
<11-6,Zack>You're hot. You seeing anybody?

342
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,800
<11-7,Raj>她的对象就是我
<11-7,Raj>Uh, she's seeing me.

343
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,120
<11-8,Zack>那你干嘛说她是你朋友
<11-8,Zack>Why'd you say she's your friend?

344
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,450
<11-9,Raj>我们只是顺其自然而已
<11-9,Raj>We're just keeping it casual.

345
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:04,490
<11-10,Zack>他为什么只是和你顺其自然  你人挺不错啊
<11-10,Zack>Why is he being casual with you? You seem great.

346
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:06,030
<11-11,Claire>我也不知道  问他吧
<11-11,Claire>I don't know. Ask him.

347
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:09,110
<11-12,Zack>你为什么只是和她顺其自然  她人挺不错啊
<11-12,Zack>Why are you being casual with her? She seems great.

348
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,920
<12-1,Leonard>也许我们应该退一步
<12-1,Leonard>Maybe we should take a step back.

349
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,160
<12-1,Leonard>为啥要退一步
<12-1,Leonard>Take a step back?

350
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,480
<12-2,Howard>我已经过了迎风尿三丈的年纪了
<12-2,Howard>I'm not a young man anymore.

351
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,570
<12-3,Leonard>不  我是说重新考虑一下导向系统的事
<12-3,Leonard>No, I mean reevaluate what we're doing with the guidance system.

352
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:29,700
<12-4,Howard>我马上就要当爸爸了
<12-4,Howard>But I got a baby on the way.

353
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,370
<12-4,Howard>我必须得多赚点钱
<12-4,Howard>I got to make some money.

354
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,750
<12-5,Leonard>如果我们不小心引发了世界末日
<12-5,Leonard>What good is money gonna do

355
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,920
<12-5,Leonard>要那么多钱又能干什么
<12-5,Leonard>if we inadvertently bring about Armageddon?

356
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,380
<12-6,Howard>等等  你先打住
<12-6,Howard>Okay, let me stop you right there.

357
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,570
<12-6,Howard>我们清楚知道自己的发明
<12-6,Howard>We absolutely know our invention

358
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:40,370
<12-6,Howard>不会被用来毁灭世界
<12-6,Howard>will not be used to destroy the world.

359
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:41,460
<12-7,Leonard>怎么知道
<12-7,Leonard>How?

360
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:43,170
<12-8,Howard>因为没人从未来穿越回来
<12-8,Howard>Because no one from the future

361
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:45,760
<12-8,Howard>追杀我们
<12-8,Howard>has come back to kill us.

362
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,310
<12-9,Leonard>真好笑
<12-9,Leonard>Very funny.

363
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:50,110
<12-10,Howard>你有更好的想法吗
<12-10,Howard>You got something better?

364
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:51,160
<12-11,Leonard>并没有
<12-11,Leonard>Well, not really.

365
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,760
<12-12,Howard>那不就得了
<12-12,Howard>Okay, then.

366
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:00,010
<12-12,Howard>天啊  你喝了多少酒啊
<12-12,Howard>Geez, how much wine did you drink?

367
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:00,870
<12-13,Leonard>不多
<12-13,Leonard>Not a lot.

368
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:04,090
<12-13,Leonard>只是你不走开  我尿不出来
<12-13,Leonard>I just couldn't start until you walked away.

369
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:10,260
<13-1,Sheldon>地狱虾猛然冲出温泉
<13-1,Sheldon>The Hell Prawn lunges out of the hot spring!

370
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:13,030
<13-1,Sheldon>你用盾牌将其抵挡
<13-1,Sheldon>You block it with your shield.

371
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,100
<13-1,Sheldon>你要出击吗
<13-1,Sheldon>Do you attack?

372
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,210
<13-2,Bernadette>它有眼睛吗
<13-2,Bernadette>Does it have eyes?

373
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:17,810
<13-3,Sheldon>三只血红色巨眼  从来不眨一下
<13-3,Sheldon>Three giant red ones and they never blink.

374
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:19,330
<13-3,Sheldon>看得人发毛
<13-3,Sheldon>It's unsettling.

375
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:22,620
<13-4,Bernadette>我刺入中间那只眼
<13-4,Bernadette>I stab it in the middle eye!

376
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:24,080
<13-5,Sheldon>明智之举
<13-5,Sheldon>Good choice!

377
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,820
<13-5,Sheldon>致命一击  你的剑
<13-5,Sheldon>Critical hit! Your sword goes

378
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,850
<13-5,Sheldon>刺穿它的眼睛  直插进它的小脑子
<13-5,Sheldon>through its eye into its tiny brain.

379
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:30,340
<13-5,Sheldon>它奄奄一息地说
<13-5,Sheldon>With its final dying gasp, it says,

380
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:34,080
<13-5,Sheldon>"你已经将我贬为一堆寿司
<13-5,Sheldon>"You have reduced me to a pile of sushi.

381
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:38,130
<13-5,Sheldon>配上这包酱油  好好享用我吧
<13-5,Sheldon>Enjoy me with this packet of soy sauce.

382
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,070
<13-5,Sheldon>这是低钠酱油哦"
<13-5,Sheldon>It's low sodium."

383
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,990
<13-6,Bernadette>好的  我会把地狱虾吃掉
<13-6,Bernadette>Okay, I guess I should eat the Hell Prawn.

384
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:46,000
<13-7,Sheldon>你用自己的剑
<13-7,Sheldon>Using your sword,

385
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,950
<13-7,Sheldon>做出了华丽的寿司大餐
<13-7,Sheldon>you prepare a beautiful sushi dinner.

386
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:51,090
<13-7,Sheldon>你将身子浸入温泉  享受着温水
<13-7,Sheldon>You slip into the hot spring and enjoy the warm water

387
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:52,540
<13-7,Sheldon>泡着你疼痛的关节
<13-7,Sheldon>on your aching joints.

388
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,330
<13-7,Sheldon>你满足地闭上眼睛
<13-7,Sheldon>As you happily close your eyes,

389
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:56,590
<13-7,Sheldon>回味着这不可思议的夜晚
<13-7,Sheldon>you recall the incredible evening you've had

390
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:58,530
<13-7,Sheldon>并发现自己的...
<13-7,Sheldon>and notice that your...

391
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:03,390
<13-7,Sheldon>脚和脚踝  比从前还要纤细
<13-7,Sheldon>...feet and ankles are smaller than they've ever been.

392
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:05,150
<13-7,Sheldon>结束
<13-7,Sheldon>The end.

393
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:08,540
<13-8,Bernadette>今晚比我预想的有趣多了
<13-8,Bernadette>Wow, this night turned out to be so much more fun than I thought.

394
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,250
<13-9,Sheldon>欢乐尚未停歇
<13-9,Sheldon>Oh, the fun doesn't stop.

395
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:13,320
<13-9,Sheldon>你还能带满满一包吐司回家呢
<13-9,Sheldon>You're still going home with a goodie bag full of toast.

396
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,480
<13-10,Bernadette>谢谢你做的这些
<13-10,Bernadette>Thank you for this.

397
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,250
<13-10,Bernadette>自从大家发现我怀孕后
<13-10,Bernadette>You know, ever since people found out I'm having a baby,

398
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,970
<13-10,Bernadette>都将我当成孕妇伯纳黛特看待
<13-10,Bernadette>I feel like I became Pregnant Bernadette.

399
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:25,530
<13-10,Bernadette>今晚能暂时放下这包袱  真是太好了
<13-10,Bernadette>It was nice to take a little break tonight.

400
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:27,170
<13-11,Sheldon>我能理解
<13-11,Sheldon>I can understand that.

401
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:29,430
<13-11,Sheldon>自从大家发现我是个天才后
<13-11,Sheldon>From the moment people realized I was a genius,

402
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:31,760
<13-11,Sheldon>我就一直被当作天才谢尔顿
<13-11,Sheldon>I've been Sheldon the Genius.

403
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:34,720
<13-11,Sheldon>不过我从来没想过甩掉这包袱
<13-11,Sheldon>Although I've never really wanted a break from that,

404
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,030
<13-11,Sheldon>所以我大概也不理解
<13-11,Sheldon>so I suppose I don't understand.

405
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:38,400
<13-11,Sheldon>这多讽刺
<13-11,Sheldon>Which is ironic

406
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,150
<13-11,Sheldon>毕竟我是个天才
<13-11,Sheldon>'cause, you know, genius.

407
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:44,300
<13-12,Bernadette>再次谢谢你
<13-12,Bernadette>Well, thanks again.

408
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,350
<13-13,Sheldon>不客气
<13-13,Sheldon>You're welcome.

409
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:48,170
<13-13,Sheldon>你什么时候想摆脱孕妇伯纳黛特这包袱
<13-13,Sheldon>And any time you need a break from being Bernadette the Pregnant,

410
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:51,000
<13-13,Sheldon>战士女皇博纳特克斯随时在此等候
<13-13,Sheldon>Bernatrix the Warrior Queen is here waiting.

411
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,640
<13-14,Bernadette>那我就恭敬不如从命了
<13-14,Bernadette>I might just take you up on that.

412
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,800
<13-15,Sheldon>提醒你哦
<13-15,Sheldon>Well, mind you now,

413
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,220
<13-15,Sheldon>此邀约仅在晚期妊娠前有效
<13-15,Sheldon>that offer's only good until the third trimester.

414
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:59,840
<13-15,Sheldon>我不能冒着我的专座被羊水沾到的风险
<13-15,Sheldon>I can't risk getting amniotic fluid on my spot.

415
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:05,610
<14-1,Raj>哥们  你在破坏我和克莱尔的关系
<14-1,Raj>Hey, dude, you're killing me with Claire.

416
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:06,930
<14-2,Zack>这话什么意思
<14-2,Zack>What are you talking about?

417
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:09,330
<14-3,Raj>我是说  瞧瞧你
<14-3,Raj>I mean, come on, look at you.

418
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:10,690
<14-3,Raj>典型美男子
<14-3,Raj>You're classically handsome,

419
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:12,350
<14-3,Raj>还拥有游泳健将的身材
<14-3,Raj>you've got a swimmer's body.

420
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:15,400
<14-3,Raj>在你身旁  我就被打回原形了
<14-3,Raj>Next to you, I look like me.

421
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:18,170
<14-4,Zack>兄弟  我不是故意的
<14-4,Zack>Oh, man, I didn't mean to do that.

422
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:22,080
<14-4,Zack>不过谢谢你看出了我游泳健将的身材
<14-4,Zack>But I do appreciate you recognizing my swimmer's body.

423
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:23,750
<14-4,Zack>这是个意外
<14-4,Zack>Which, incidentally,

424
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:27,260
<14-4,Zack>马可波罗是一个在泳池玩的捉迷藏游戏
<14-4,Zack>一个人当鬼蒙上眼睛去抓其他人

425
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:27,260
<14-4,Zack>我在基督青年会玩"马可波罗"游戏练出来的
<14-4,Zack>I got from playing Marco Polo at the YMCA.

426
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,620
<14-5,Raj>好吧  帮我个忙
<14-5,Raj>Yeah, okay, just... do me a favor

427
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:34,960
<14-5,Raj>不要再说克莱尔多棒多好了
<14-5,Raj>and stop talking about how great Claire is.

428
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:38,020
<14-6,Zack>乐意效劳  我的外国小友人
<14-6,Zack>Anything for you, my little foreign friend.

429
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:40,310
<14-7,Claire>我得问一句
<14-7,Claire>So, I got to ask,

430
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,940
<14-7,Claire>拉杰会带别的姑娘跟你们玩吗
<14-7,Claire>does Raj bring around other girls?

431
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:44,940
<14-8,Penny>这个嘛
<14-8,Penny>Uh, you know,

432
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,870
<14-8,Penny>我不经常跟他们一起玩
<14-8,Penny>I-I'm not really around that much.

433
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:49,040
<14-8,Penny>这事艾米比我可清楚多了
<14-8,Penny>Amy knows much more than I do.

434
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,820
<14-9,Leonard>我觉得你没什么可担心的
<14-9,Leonard>I don't think you have anything to worry about.

435
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,840
<14-9,Leonard>拉杰人很好  过分忠诚
<14-9,Leonard>Raj is a terrific guy, loyal to a fault.

436
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,830
<14-10,Howard>对啊  他还没丢掉美国在线的邮箱呢
<14-10,Howard>Yeah. He still has an AOL address.

438
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:01,080
<14-11,Zack>我懂你的意思
<14-11,Zack>I see what you're saying.

439
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,760
<14-11,Zack>她也没有多好嘛
<14-11,Zack>She's not so great.

440
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:09,580
<14-12,Raj>别听他的
<14-12,Raj>Don't listen to him.

441
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,320
<14-12,Raj>他总说傻话
<14-12,Raj>He says crazy things all the time.

442
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,290
<14-12,Raj>不信你看  马可
<14-12,Raj>Uh, watch. Marco.

443
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:15,170
<14-12,Raj>游戏中鬼会先喊"马克"  躲起来的人就回"波罗"
<14-12,Raj>让鬼由声音来判断其他人躲在哪里

444
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:15,170
<14-13,Zack>波罗
<14-13,Zack>Polo!

445
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:19,530
<14-14,Raj>你们在聊什么呢
<14-14,Raj>So, uh, what are you guys talking about?

446
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:21,300
<14-15,Claire>你朋友们正跟我讲
<14-15,Claire>Your friends were just telling me about

447
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,700
<14-15,Claire>你约会的其他姑娘的事儿呢
<14-15,Claire>all the other girls you're dating.

448
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,080
<14-16,Raj>你们干嘛要这样
<14-16,Raj>Why would you do that?

449
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,750
<14-16,Raj>我特地嘱咐过你们不要说
<14-16,Raj>I specifically asked you not to do that.

450
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,970
<14-17,Penny>我们没说
<14-17,Penny>We didn't.

451
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:31,380
<14-18,Amy>你刚自己说了
<14-18,Amy>You just did.

452
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,220
<14-19,Zack>看来你们没一个智商超群
<14-19,Zack>Maybe none of you guys are smart.

453
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:45,600
<15-1,Leonard>早
<15-1,Leonard>Morning.

454
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,120
<15-1,Leonard>早
<15-1,Leonard>Morning.

455
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,450
<15-3,Leonard>酒喝太多了
<15-3,Leonard>Ugh. Too much wine.

456
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:51,800
<15-4,Sheldon>我昨晚也是吃太多了
<15-4,Sheldon>Oh, I overdid it myself last night.

457
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,440
<15-4,Sheldon>我也要来片回魂吐司
<15-4,Sheldon>Hair of the dog.

458
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,440
<15-4,Sheldon>宿醉时靠再喝酒缓解痛苦的方法
<15-4,Sheldon>又被称为喝"回魂酒"

459
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:58,090
<15-5,Leonard>你有没有想过我们的导向系统
<15-5,Leonard>Hey, did you ever think about the military applications

460
00:18:58,090 --> 00:18:59,710
<15-5,Leonard>被用到军事用途上
<15-5,Leonard>for the guidance system?

461
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:01,170
<15-6,Sheldon>当然了
<15-6,Sheldon>Of course.

462
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:03,270
<15-7,Leonard>你心里不会不舒服吗
<15-7,Leonard>Does it bother you?

463
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,430
<15-8,Sheldon>不啊  虽然一开始会
<15-8,Sheldon>No, it did at first,

464
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:09,010
<15-8,Sheldon>然后我跟法兰克与艾丽西娅聊过以后
<15-8,Sheldon>but then I talked it through with Frank and Alicia, and...

465
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:14,770
<15-8,Sheldon>他们真的让我换个新角度看待这件事
<15-8,Sheldon>...they really helped put things into perspective.

466
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:17,310
<15-9,Leonard>这俩人是谁啊
<15-9,Leonard>Who are these people?

467
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:22,190
<15-10,Sheldon>莱纳德  朋友就像厕纸
<15-10,Sheldon>Leonard, friends are like toilet paper.

468
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:25,970
<15-10,Sheldon>洗手台下面多备着几卷准没错
<15-10,Sheldon>It's good to have extras under the sink.
