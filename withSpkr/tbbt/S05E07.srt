1
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:09,020
<1-1,Sheldon>然后让反质子的自旋反向
<1-1,Sheldon>And reverse the spin on the antiproton...

2
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:12,670
<1-1,Sheldon>γ变成了α
<1-1,Sheldon>and γ becomes α...

3
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:17,620
<1-1,Sheldon>乘以矩阵(-i,0)
<1-1,Sheldon>Multiplied by a matrix of ...

4
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:20,010
<1-1,Sheldon>有成果了
<1-1,Sheldon>And there we have it.

5
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:25,310
<1-1,Sheldon>证明我九点过后就是一条废柴的证据
<1-1,Sheldon>Conclusive proof that I am absolutely worthless after 9 o'clock.

6
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:31,150
<1-2,Ghostly voice>谢尔顿...
<1-2,Ghostly voice>Sheldon...

7
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,360
<1-2,Ghostly voice>谢尔顿...
<1-2,Ghostly voice>Sheldon...

8
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,450
<1-2,Ghostly voice>好了  好了
<1-2,Ghostly voice>All right, all right.

9
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:56,280
<1-3,Sheldon>我看穿了你们的诡计
<1-3,Sheldon>I see what's going on.

10
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,920
<1-3,Sheldon>万圣节前的装神弄鬼罢了
<1-3,Sheldon>A little pre-Halloween hijinkery.

11
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,160
<1-3,Sheldon>阴森的呜咽
<1-3,Sheldon>A ghostly moan,

12
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,230
<1-3,Sheldon>铁链的响声
<1-3,Sheldon>a rattling of chains,

13
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:13,230
<1-3,Sheldon>女巫的奸笑
<1-3,Sheldon>a witch's cackle.

14
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:17,070
<1-3,Sheldon>老套的鬼屋三元素
<1-3,Sheldon>The trifecta of haunted house cliche.

15
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:20,140
<1-3,Sheldon>普通人尖叫  哥只想睡觉
<1-3,Sheldon>Instead of "eek," I say, "yawn."

16
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:26,150
<1-4,Ghostly voice>谢尔顿...
<1-4,Ghostly voice>Sheldon...

17
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:32,120
<1-5,Sheldon>滴血之墙
<1-5,Sheldon>Oh, the walls are dripping blood,

18
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:35,320
<1-5,Sheldon>看上去假得就像把碳酸钠溶液
<1-5,Sheldon>which looks nothing like a phenolphthalein indicator

20
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,360
<1-5,Sheldon>滴进了酚酞里一样
<1-5,Sheldon>exposed to a sodium carbonate solution.

21
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:44,680
<1-5,Sheldon>"我们地狱里见谢尔顿"
<1-5,Sheldon>"See you in hell Sheldon."

22
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:49,290
<1-5,Sheldon>这话最恐怖的地方  是你忘了加逗号了
<1-5,Sheldon>The most frightening thing about that is the missing comma.

23
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:55,940
<1-5,Sheldon>好  很好
<1-5,Sheldon>Okay, all right.

24
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,280
<1-5,Sheldon>这招高
<1-5,Sheldon>That one was clever.

25
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,810
<1-5,Sheldon>缆绳上挂着个含磷的骨架
<1-5,Sheldon>Skeleton with phosphorous on a zip line.

26
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,550
<1-5,Sheldon>现身吧  快活的恶作剧者们[也是乐队名]
<1-5,Sheldon>Come on out, merry pranksters.

27
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:06,620
<1-5,Sheldon>该谢幕了
<1-5,Sheldon>Take a bow.

28
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:12,390
<1-6,Raj>你真该看看你刚才的表情
<1-6,Raj>You should've seen your face.

29
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:16,160
<1-7,Sheldon>有什么呀  不过就是稍稍受到惊吓
<1-7,Sheldon>Yes, there's nothing quite like the slightly widened eyes

30
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,400
<1-7,Sheldon>然后瞳孔小小地放大了一点
<1-7,Sheldon>of mildly startled.

31
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,790
<1-8,Howard>你就承认吧  谢尔顿
<1-8,Howard>Come on, admit it.

32
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:20,960
<1-8,Howard>我们吓着你了
<1-8,Howard>We got you, Sheldon.

33
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,720
<1-9,Sheldon>拜托  惊吓惊吓  有惊才有吓
<1-9,Sheldon>Please, fright depends on an element of surprise.

34
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,060
<1-9,Sheldon>而事实是
<1-9,Sheldon>The simple fact is,

35
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,070
<1-9,Sheldon>在能未卜先知的我面前
<1-9,Sheldon>because I am much smarter than you,

36
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:30,300
<1-9,Sheldon>你们两个臭皮匠的烂招  只是笑话
<1-9,Sheldon>and able to anticipate your actions,

37
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,860
<1-9,Sheldon>想吓到我诸葛亮
<1-9,Sheldon>it is highly unlikely that you two rubes

38
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,880
<1-9,Sheldon>门都没有
<1-9,Sheldon>could ever surprise me.

39
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:36,880
<1-10,Raj>他说的对吧
<1-10,Raj>He's probably right.

40
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,700
<1-11,Howard>我们吓不倒他  他太聪明了
<1-11,Howard>We can't beat him. He's just too smart.

41
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,760
<1-12,Sheldon>先生们
<1-12,Sheldon>Gentlemen.

42
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,430
<1-13,Howard>谁刚才赌他会晕倒来着
<1-13,Howard>Who had money on "faints"?

43
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,580
<1-14,Raj>我赌的是尿裤子
<1-14,Raj>I had "pee his pants."

44
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:51,820
<1-15,Leonard>等等
<1-15,Leonard>Hang on.

45
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,010
<1-15,Leonard>看来我们都赌中了
<1-15,Leonard>Looks like everyone's a winner.

55
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:19,970
<2-1,Leonard>当心了  谢尔顿
<2-1,Leonard>Oh. Watch out, Sheldon.

56
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:23,810
<2-1,Leonard>这个《鬼马小精灵》可是个鬼-鬼-鬼-鬼啊
<2-1,Leonard>This little boy Casper is a g-g-g-ghost!

57
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:25,970
<2-2,Sheldon>可笑
<2-2,Sheldon>Droll.

58
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:27,810
<2-2,Sheldon>那也可笑不过一个成年人
<2-2,Sheldon>Not as droll as a grown man

59
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:30,010
<2-2,Sheldon>晕倒在自己的一滩尿上
<2-2,Sheldon>passed out in a puddle of his own urine.

60
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,050
<2-3,Leonard>的确太可笑了
<2-3,Leonard>That was pretty droll.

62
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,880
<2-3,Leonard>笑声中还带着一丝氨气的芬芳
<2-3,Leonard>With a hint of ammonia.

63
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,010
<2-4,Sheldon>接着沾沾自喜着吓人的胜果吧  先生们
<2-4,Sheldon>Yes, enjoy your japes, gentlemen.

64
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,750
<2-4,Sheldon>觉得自己吓倒了一名胆小的大学学者
<2-4,Sheldon>You think you've poked fun at a milquetoast academic.

65
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,350
<2-4,Sheldon>可你们忘了一件事
<2-4,Sheldon>Well, you've forgotten one thing:

66
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:45,720
<2-4,Sheldon>我可是孤星州[德州别称]之子
<2-4,Sheldon>I am also a son of the Lone Star state.

67
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,890
<2-4,Sheldon>我可是彻头彻尾的德州人
<2-4,Sheldon>I'm Texas through and through.

68
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:50,640
<2-4,Sheldon>我们可会修理人了
<2-4,Sheldon>And we know how to settle scores down there.

69
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:54,310
<2-4,Sheldon>不信就去问  常被我们修理的墨西哥人
<2-4,Sheldon>If you doubt me, ask Mexico.

70
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,260
<2-5,Stuart>辣妹出没  九点钟方向
<2-5,Stuart>Hot girl, nine o'clock.

71
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:02,400
<2-5,Stuart>别同时抬头看人家
<2-5,Stuart>Don't everybody look at once!

72
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,210
<2-6,Raj>她来漫画书店做什么
<2-6,Raj>What is she doing in a comic book store?

73
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:10,090
<2-7,Stuart>我不清楚  估计是迷路了
<2-7,Stuart>I don't know, she might be lost.

74
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:14,800
<2-7,Stuart>无所谓了  都学着点儿
<2-7,Stuart>Doesn't matter. Watch and learn.

75
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:21,760
<2-8,Hot girl>-你好啊  -你好
<2-8,Hot girl>- Hi.  - Hi.

76
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:26,820
<2-9,Stuart>呃...呃...呃
<2-9,Stuart>... it-it-it...

77
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:35,070
<2-9,Stuart>都闭嘴
<2-9,Stuart>Shut up.

78
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,700
<2-10,Hot girl (to Leonard)>你要买这期《Next Men》吗
<2-10,Hot girl (to Leonard)>Are you getting this Next Men?

79
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,600
<2-11,Leonard>是的  这是第二十一期的那本
<2-11,Leonard>Uh, yeah. It's issue number 21.

00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:41,810
<2-11,Leonard>地狱男爵第一次登场的那期
<2-11,Leonard>First appearance of Hellboy.

81
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:44,540
<2-12,Hot girl>我知道  我找了它很多年
<2-12,Hot girl>I know. I've been looking for it for years.

82
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:47,610
<2-13,Leonard>-抱歉了  -要是我假装来泡你
<2-13,Leonard>- Sorry.  - Hey, if I pretended to hit on you,

83
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:50,510
<2-14,Hot girl>我的美貌够不够让你分心  好让我把书偷走
<2-14,Hot girl>could I distract you enough to sneak it away?

84
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:55,090
<2-15,Leonard>够的  但滥用超能美貌做坏事是不对的
<2-15,Leonard>Yes, but you'd be using your superpowers for evil.

85
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:58,820
<2-16,Hot girl>该死  我在氪星的老爸禁止我用能力使坏
<2-16,Hot girl>Damn, I'm forbidden by my Kryptonian father to do so.

87
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,330
<2-16,Hot girl>我叫爱丽丝

00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,100
<2-19,Leonard>这书你拿去吧
<2-19,Leonard>You know, go ahead and take it.

92
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,200
<2-20,Alice>不  不行  这样我就做坏事了
<2-20,Alice>No, no. No, no, I-I did evil.

93
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,070
<2-20,Alice>你接受以物易物吗
<2-20,Alice>Would you be open to a trade?

94
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,840
<2-21,Leonard>可以  没问题

<2-23,Leonard>抱歉  手掌有点出汗
<2-23,Leonard>Sorry, palm's a little sweaty.

99
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,580
<2-23,Leonard>那是个什么词儿呀
<2-23,Leonard>What's that word?

100
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:26,620
<2-25,Leonard>-爱丽丝  -对哦  你的名字
<2-25,Leonard>- Alice.  - Oh, right, your name.

101
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,990
<2-25,Leonard>刚看成"爱鸡鸡"还纳闷呢
<2-25,Leonard>That makes more sense than "Penis".

102
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,680
<2-26,Alice>回见了
<2-26,Alice>Later.

103
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:37,290
<2-27,Howard>我们亲眼目睹到你在漫画店成功把到妹吗
<2-27,Howard>Did we just see you pick up a girl in a comic book store?

104
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,360
<2-28,Stuart>如果是真的  我要把你的肖像
<2-28,Stuart>'Cause if you did, you get your picture up there

105
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,230
<2-28,Stuart>挂在英雄榜上
<2-28,Stuart>on the Wall of Heroes.

106
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:43,640
<2-29,Leonard>没有吧  应该没有把到她
<2-29,Leonard>No, I don't think I picked her up.

107
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,620
<2-29,Leonard>更何况我还有家室呢
<2-29,Leonard>Besides, I have a girlfriend.

108
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,770
<2-30,Stuart>无所谓  你算是最成功的一个了
<2-30,Stuart>Doesn't matter. This is the closest anyone's ever come.

109

<2-30,Stuart>你入榜了  伙计
<2-30,Stuart>You're going on the wall, my friend.

00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,990
<3-2,Leonard>-你没事吧  -没事
<3-2,Leonard>- What's with you? - Nothing.

113
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:00,880
<3-3,Sheldon>我锲而不舍有什么奇怪的
<3-3,Sheldon>It's not suspicious that I'm fixating.

114
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,810
<3-3,Sheldon>我个性向来坚持不懈
<3-3,Sheldon>It's consistent with my personality.

115
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:05,070
<3-4,Leonard>好吧
<3-4,Leonard>Right.

116

<3-11,Leonard>几份广告而已  没什么重要的东西
<3-11,Leonard>A couple of circulars, nothing important.

<3-12,Penny>-他怎么了  -等着瞧
<3-12,Penny>- What's with him? - Hang on.

00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:23,760
<7-9,Sheldon>如果需要帮忙的话
<7-9,Sheldon>Well, if it's of any help,

252
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,930
<7-9,Sheldon>我读过各种伦理学家的著作
<7-9,Sheldon>I've read all the great moral philosophers,

254
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:29,200
<7-9,Sheldon>包括苏斯博士的书哦
<7-9,Sheldon>including Dr. Seuss.

255
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:32,810
<7-10,Leonard>死马当活马医吧
<7-10,Leonard>Oh, what the hell.

256
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:34,600
<7-10,Leonard>我本来要去见
<7-10,Leonard>I'm supposed to go see that girl

257
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,800
<7-10,Leonard>在漫画书店认识的那个女孩子  爱丽丝
<7-10,Leonard>from the comic book store, Alice,

258
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,990
<7-10,Leonard>可我不知道该不该去
<7-10,Leonard>but I don't know if I should,

259
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:39,120
<7-10,Leonard>因为我现在跟普利娅在一起
<7-10,Leonard>because I'm going out with Priya,

260
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,730
<7-10,Leonard>可她人又远在印度
<7-10,Leonard>but she's in India.

261
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:45,780
<7-11,Sheldon>好吧  这么说现在的主题是性忠贞
<7-11,Sheldon>All right. So the topic at hand is sexual fidelity.

262
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:48,430
<7-11,Sheldon>苏斯博士在这方面估计靠不住
<7-11,Sheldon>Probably won't be relying on Seuss here.

264
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:51,400
<7-11,Sheldon>不过《一条鱼  两条鱼  红色的鱼  蓝色的鱼》
<7-11,Sheldon>Although One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish

265
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,650
<7-11,Sheldon>倒可能惊人的适用
<7-11,Sheldon>might be surprisingly applicable.

266
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,530
<7-11,Sheldon>继续
<7-11,Sheldon>Go on.

267
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:57,450
<7-11,Sheldon>那个
<7-11,Sheldon>Well...

268
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:59,190
<7-12,Leonard>别人都说  人到了暮年
<7-12,Leonard>they say at the end of your life,

269
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:00,720
<7-12,Leonard>比起自己做过的事
<7-12,Leonard>you regret the stuff you didn't do

270
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,410
<7-12,Leonard>会更后悔没有做过一些事
<7-12,Leonard>more than the stuff that you did,

271
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:06,400
<7-12,Leonard>而我非常确定我很想跟爱丽丝"做"
<7-12,Leonard>and I'm pretty sure Alice is the stuff I want to do.

272
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:11,510
<7-13,Sheldon>德国哲学家弗里德里希·尼采
<7-13,Sheldon>You know, the German philosopher, Friedrich Nietzsche,

273
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:14,980
<7-13,Sheldon>相信道德只是低等人群体
<7-13,Sheldon>believed that morality is just a fiction

274
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,750
<7-13,Sheldon>用来阻碍少数高等人的
<7-13,Sheldon>used by the herd of inferior human beings

275
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:21,690
<7-13,Sheldon>虚构事物
<7-13,Sheldon>to hold back the few superior men.

276
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:24,040
<7-14,Leonard>死马还真给医活了
<7-14,Leonard>That actually does help.

277
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,110
<7-15,Sheldon>值得一提的是  他后来死于梅毒
<7-15,Sheldon>It's worth noting that he died of syphilis.

278
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,900
<7-17,Sheldon>-管他呢  我去也  -你回家的路上
<7-17,Sheldon>- Screw it, I'm going.   - On your way home,

279
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,170
<7-17,Sheldon>-能不能买点橙汁回来  -拜托
<7-17,Sheldon>- will you pick up some orange juice? - Do you mind?

280
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:38,210
<7-18,Leonard>我正在质疑我人生中很多的人事物呢
<7-18,Leonard>I'm questioning a lot of things in my life right now.

281
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:42,080
<7-19,Sheldon>你喜欢橙汁也需要质疑吗
<7-19,Sheldon>Is one of those things your fondness for orange juice?

282
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,500
<7-21,Sheldon>-不用  -那就对了  纯果乐  要没果肉的
<7-21,Sheldon>- No.  - Great. Tropicana, no pulp.

283
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:54,560
<8-1,Howard>嗨  谢尔顿
<8-1,Howard>Hey, Sheldon.

284
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,260
<8-2,Bernadette (off)>谁啊
<8-2,Bernadette (off)>Who is it!

285
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,570
<8-3,Sheldon>沃罗威茨太太  是我  谢尔顿
<8-3,Sheldon>It's me, Sheldon, Mrs. Wolowitz.

286
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:01,690
<8-4,Howard>那不是我妈  是伯纳黛特
<8-4,Howard>That's not my mom, it's Bernadette.

287
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:06,390
<8-5,Sheldon>真的吗  真分不出来
<8-5,Sheldon>Really? That's very unsettling.

288
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:07,950
<8-6,Bernadette>嗨  谢尔顿
<8-6,Bernadette>Hi, Sheldon.

289
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:10,770
<8-8,Howard>-嗨  -有事吗
<8-8,Howard>- Hi.  - What's up?

290
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:14,300
<8-9,Sheldon>我刚想到  我一直都还没正式恭祝过
<8-9,Sheldon>It just occurred to me that I never formally congratulated you

291
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,720
<8-9,Sheldon>你们即将到来的婚事
<8-9,Sheldon>on your pending nuptials.

292
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,760
<8-9,Sheldon>于是我跳上首班车
<8-9,Sheldon>So I hopped on

293
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:20,400
<8-9,Sheldon>一路狂奔过来跟你握手道贺
<8-9,Sheldon>the first bus and hightailed it down here to shake your hand.

294
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,180
<8-9,Sheldon>快把手伸过来  你这家伙
<8-9,Sheldon>Put 'er there, you old so-and-so.

295
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:26,760
<8-10,Howard>再过12小时  咱俩就一起上班了
<8-10,Howard>Well, I-I'm gonna see you at work in...12 hours

296
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,450
<8-10,Howard>你怎么不等上班了再跟我握手呢
<8-10,Howard>don't you think it could have waited until then?

297
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:33,330
<8-11,Sheldon>我的老天  我怎么就没想到呢
<8-11,Sheldon>Holy smoke, why didn't I think of that?

298
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:35,570
<8-11,Sheldon>你果然比我聪明  霍华德·沃罗威茨
<8-11,Sheldon>You're a better man than I, Howard Wolowitz.

299
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:38,140
<8-11,Sheldon>快把手伸出来  你个小聪明
<8-11,Sheldon>You put 'er there, you son of a gun!

300
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:40,750
<8-12,Howard>那随你吧
<8-12,Howard>Whatever.

301
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:43,370
<8-12,Howard>天啊
<8-12,Howard>My...oh...

302
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:45,590
<8-12,Howard>我
<8-12,Howard>it's...

303
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,690
<8-13,Bernadette>天啊  霍华德
<8-13,Bernadette>Oh, my God, Howard!

304
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:49,790
<8-13,Bernadette>你对他做了什么
<8-13,Bernadette>What did you do?

305
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:52,240
<8-14,Sheldon>只是个无恶意的万圣节恶作剧而已  看
<8-14,Sheldon>It was a harmless Halloween prank. Look.

306
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,100
<8-15,Bernadette>霍华德有心脏病  你又不是不知道
<8-15,Bernadette>Howard has a heart condition! You know that!

307
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,290
<8-16,Sheldon>我还以为他那是瞎编的呢
<8-16,Sheldon>Well, I thought he made that up.

308
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,770
<8-16,Sheldon>犹太人不是常有
<8-16,Sheldon>I-Isn't hypochondria

309
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:01,600
<8-16,Sheldon>疑病症的问题吗
<8-16,Sheldon>a common idiosyncrasy of Jewish people?

310
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,030
<8-17,Bernadette>这是肾上腺素
<8-17,Bernadette>This is adrenaline --

311
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,940
<8-17,Bernadette>我们得把这个注射到他的心脏里
<8-17,Bernadette>we're gonna have to inject it into his heart.

312
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,370
<8-18,Sheldon>-我们得做吗  -是你做
<8-18,Sheldon>- We are?  - You are.

313
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:11,310
<8-19,Bernadette>我可没那么大劲扎穿他的胸腔
<8-19,Bernadette>I'm not strong enough to get it through his chest plate,

314
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:13,500
<8-19,Bernadette>而且机会只有一次
<8-19,Bernadette>and we've only got one shot.

315
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:17,040
<8-20,Sheldon>不  我做不来
<8-20,Sheldon>Oh, no! I can't!

316
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:17,550
<8-21,Bernadette>快点
<8-21,Bernadette>Hurry!

317
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:19,630
<8-21,Bernadette>咱们时间不多了
<8-21,Bernadette>We're running out of time!

318
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,270
<8-23,Bernadette>-好吧  -快扎呀
<8-23,Bernadette>- Okay.  - Just do it!

319
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:23,130
<8-24,Sheldon>上帝啊
<8-24,Sheldon>Oh, God!

320
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:24,990
<8-24,Sheldon>一  二
<8-24,Sheldon>One...two...

321
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:26,830
<8-24,Sheldon>三
<8-24,Sheldon>three!

322
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:29,550
<8-25,Howard>不给糖就捣蛋  笨蛋
<8-25,Howard>Trick or treat, bubbeleh.

323
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:30,890
<8-25,Howard>什么
<8-25,Howard>What?

324
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:35,290
<8-26,Sheldon>不是吧  你们居然设局耍我
<8-26,Sheldon>No. You mean this was all a ruse?

325
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:39,080
<8-26,Sheldon>我怎么会笨成这...
<8-26,Sheldon>Oh, how could I be so stu...

326
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,170
<9-1,Leonard>该死的  不行
<9-1,Leonard>Damn it, I can't.

327
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:48,720
<9-1,Leonard>我不能这样
<9-1,Leonard>I can't do this.

328
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,890
<9-2,Alice>是因为我的舌环吗
<9-2,Alice>Uh, is it my tongue stud?

329
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:51,060
<9-2,Alice>要是有穿舌环就会吓到你
<9-2,Alice>'Cause if that freaks you out,

330
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,850
<9-2,Alice>那待会儿你会更大吃一惊哦
<9-2,Alice>you're in for a real surprise later on.

331
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:54,170
<9-2,Alice>不  不是
<9-2,Alice>No, no, no.

332
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:56,400
<9-3,Leonard>是我不能跟你这样
<9-3,Leonard>I-I can't do this.

333
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,610
<9-3,Leonard>相信我  我真的很想
<9-3,Leonard>Believe me, I really want to.

334
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:01,540
<9-5,Leonard>-但是呢  -但是我有女朋友了
<9-5,Leonard>- But...?  - But I kind of have a girlfriend.

335
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,580
<9-6,Alice>你开什么玩笑
<9-6,Alice>Are you kidding?

336
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:05,270
<9-7,Leonard>你不介意咱俩只做朋友吧
<9-7,Leonard>You're cool with you and me just being friends, right?

337
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:06,710
<9-8,Alice>我真不敢相信
<9-8,Alice>I don't believe this.

338
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:09,740
<9-9,Leonard>等等  我...你不相信哪部分
<9-9,Leonard>Wait, I don't... Which part?

339
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,410
<9-10,Alice>我真是笨到家了
<9-10,Alice>I'm so stupid.

340
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:12,690
<9-10,Alice>我还以为我终于遇上了个好人呢
<9-10,Alice>I thought for once I'd met a good guy,

341
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:14,280
<9-10,Alice>结果你也只不过又是一个混蛋而已
<9-10,Alice>but you're just another jackass.

342
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,400
<9-11,Leonard>不  不  你误会了
<9-11,Leonard>Oh, no, no, you have it wrong.

343
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,980
<9-11,Leonard>不  我本来是要当个混蛋
<9-11,Leonard>No. I-I was going to be a jackass,

344
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:22,220
<9-11,Leonard>但是我克制住了
<9-11,Leonard>but I stopped myself.

345
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:24,860
<9-11,Leonard>我决定做个好人  所以
<9-11,Leonard>I stayed a good guy, so...

346
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,830
<9-11,Leonard>我还是不跟你滚床单了
<9-11,Leonard>I'm gonna pass on the sex.

347
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:30,190
<9-11,Leonard>但是你要知道  这并不代表你不够辣
<9-11,Leonard>But you should know, that's not a comment on your hotness

348
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:32,830
<9-11,Leonard>这只是说明我品德高尚
<9-11,Leonard>but on my goodness.

349
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:34,360
<9-11,Leonard>这也算是我的超能力了吧
<9-11,Leonard>That's kind of my superpower.

350
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,380
<9-11,Leonard>我就像是  好人队长
<9-11,Leonard>I'm, like, Captain Good Guy.

351
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,690
<9-11,Leonard>没啥了不起的
<9-11,Leonard>It's okay.

352
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:45,210
<10-1,Leonard>做了对的选择
<10-1,Leonard>Did the right thing.

353
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:48,060
<10-1,Leonard>我悔得肠子都青了
<10-1,Leonard>You idiot!

354
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,760
<11-1,Leonard>普丽娅
<11-1,Leonard>Hey, Priya.

355
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,240
<11-2,Priya>亲爱的  一切都好吗
<11-2,Priya>Hey, sweetheart. How's it going?

356
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,440
<11-3,Leonard>不怎么样
<11-3,Leonard>Uh, not so good.

357
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,740
<11-3,Leonard>咱俩得谈谈
<11-3,Leonard>We have to talk.

358
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:00,190
<11-4,Priya>好像很严重的样子啊  怎么了
<11-4,Priya>Oh, sounds serious. What's up?

359
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:03,430
<11-4,Priya>好吧  事情是这样的
<11-4,Priya>Okay, uh...here it is.

360
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:05,240
<11-5,Leonard>我认识了一个女生  我们接吻了
<11-5,Leonard>I met this girl and I kissed her,

361
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,540
<11-5,Leonard>我觉得很内疚
<11-5,Leonard>and I feel terrible about it.

362
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,680
<11-5,Leonard>但都结束了  绝无下次
<11-5,Leonard>But it's done, it's never gonna happen again.

363
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,320
<11-5,Leonard>我真的非常非常抱歉
<11-5,Leonard>And I am so, so sorry.

364
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,920
<11-6,Priya>莱纳德  别紧张
<11-6,Priya>Leonard, relax.

365
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,720
<11-6,Priya>没事的
<11-6,Priya>It's okay.

366
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,880
<11-7,Leonard>真的吗
<11-7,Leonard>It is?

367
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,530
<11-8,Priya>是啊  这种事情很正常
<11-8,Priya>Yeah, these things happen.

368
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:18,740
<11-8,Priya>人之常情嘛
<11-8,Priya>They happen to everybody.

369
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:21,770
<11-9,Leonard>天啊  你真是太好了
<11-9,Leonard>Oh, my God, you are amazing.

370
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:23,760
<11-9,Leonard>我怎么这么命好呀
<11-9,Leonard>I mean, I don't deserve you.

371
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,290
<11-9,Leonard>等  等会  你说"人之常情"是什么意思
<11-9,Leonard>Wh-what do you mean "everybody"?

372
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:31,140
<11-10,Priya>莱纳德  我不知道该不该说
<11-10,Priya>Leonard, I didn't know if I should tell you,

373
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:34,330
<11-10,Priya>不过我好像也背叛你了
<11-10,Priya>but I kind of cheated on you, too.

374
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:36,870
<11-11,Leonard>什么叫好像
<11-11,Leonard>Kind of?

375
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:39,420
<11-12,Priya>几周前
<11-12,Priya>A couple of weeks ago,

376
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:42,460
<11-12,Priya>我跟我前男友上床了
<11-12,Priya>I slept with my ex-boyfriend.

377
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:45,460
<11-12,Priya>所以说  我们俩都犯了点小错误
<11-12,Priya>So, I guess we both messed up a little.

378
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:50,660
<11-13,Leonard>不  我是犯了点小错  你可是犯了大错
<11-13,Leonard>No, no, I messed up a little. You messed up a lot.

379
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,920
<11-14,Priya>咱这又不是在比赛
<11-14,Priya>Well, it's not a competition.

380
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:57,990
<11-15,Leonard>就是比赛  而且你赢了
<11-15,Leonard>Oh...yeah, it is, and you won.

381
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,560
<11-15,Leonard>对  对不起  我要下线了
<11-15,Leonard>I-I-I'm sorry, I have to go.

382
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:05,380
<11-15,Leonard>老天爷你玩我啊
<11-15,Leonard>I don't believe this.

383
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:19,920
<11-16,Sheldon (leaping out of the base of the sofa)>吓到了吧  小混蛋  现在我们扯平了
<11-16,Sheldon (leaping out of the base of the sofa)>Bazinga, punk. Now we're even.
