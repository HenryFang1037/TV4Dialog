1
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:04,390
<1-1,Penny>我们当时准备要拍一幕戏
<1-1,Penny>So, we're about to shoot this scene in the movie

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:08,060
<1-1,Penny>是杀人恶猿的DNA正慢慢占领我全身
<1-1,Penny>where the killer ape DNA is slowly taking over my body.

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:09,350
<1-2,Leonard>然后呢
<1-2,Leonard>Okay.

4
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:11,600
<1-3,Penny>但我发现他们把我全身都粘上毛发
<1-3,Penny>But I realize they're gluing fur everywhere,

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,890
<1-3,Penny>唯独没粘我的乳沟
<1-3,Penny>except my cleavage.

6
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:14,540
<1-3,Penny>所以我就问导演为什么
<1-3,Penny>So, I asked the director why

7
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:16,700
<1-3,Penny>他说把乳沟留到最后猿化  对电影剧情
<1-3,Penny>and he says, it's important to the story that my boobs

8
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,740
<1-3,Penny>有着十分重大的意义
<1-3,Penny>be the last things to turn ape.

9
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,310
<1-4,Leonard>他还觉得这电影有剧情  真可爱
<1-4,Leonard>It's sweet that he thinks there is a story.

10
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:27,710
<1-5,Penny>而且片场居然没有厕所
<1-5,Penny>Oh, and there's not even a bathroom on set.

11
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:30,130
<1-5,Penny>我得走到对街的加油站去借厕所
<1-5,Penny>I have to go to the gas station across the street.

12
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:31,760
<1-5,Penny>而且我都已经半人半猿了
<1-5,Penny>I mean, I was dressed like half an ape

13
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,290
<1-5,Penny>却还不及那厕所里最恶心的人的一半
<1-5,Penny>and still not even close to the most disgusting person in there.

14
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:38,620
<1-6,Sheldon>-莱纳德  我需要你帮个忙  -行  什么事
<1-6,Sheldon>- Leonard, I could use your assistance. - Sure. What's up?

15
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,470
<1-7,Leonard>我现在放弃弦理论了
<1-7,Leonard>Well, now that I've given up string theory,

17
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:43,100
<1-8,Sheldon>我在纠结该选哪个新研究领域
<1-8,Sheldon>I'm struggling to find my next area of focus.

18
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,100
<1-8,Sheldon>从你的专业眼光来看
<1-8,Sheldon>So, in your professional opinion,

19
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,480
<1-8,Sheldon>你觉得这几个领域中  哪个最有发展前途
<1-8,Sheldon>which of these areas do you think is the most promising?

20
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,060
<1-9,Leonard>我觉得暗物质领域有不少
<1-9,Leonard>Huh, well, I-I think there's some really innovative stuff

21
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,900
<1-9,Leonard>创新十足的发现
<1-9,Leonard>going on in dark matter.

22
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,310
<1-10,Sheldon>感谢帮助
<1-10,Sheldon>That's helpful.

23
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:00,270
<1-10,Sheldon>-好  在这四个领域中...  -谢尔顿
<1-10,Sheldon>- Okay. Of these four areas... - Sheldon!

24
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:03,340
<1-11,Penny>-不是教你要当个好的小伙伴了吗  -谢谢
<1-11,Penny>- What did we say about being a nicer friend? - Thank you.

25
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:07,140
<1-13,Penny>莱纳德  不是教你别又蠢又爱哇哇叫吗
<1-13,Penny>Lenard, what did we say about being a gullible weenie?

26
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,180
<1-14,Sheldon>-这真是太烦了  -那是因为你逼自己太紧
<1-14,Sheldon>- It is just so frustrating. - 'Cause you're trying too hard.

27
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,290
<1-15,Penny>你得做点别的事  转移下注意力
<1-15,Penny>You need to do something else. Get your mind off it.

28
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:15,710
<1-16,Leonard>我们让"无限可能周四夜"复活如何
<1-16,Leonard>Hey. How about we bring back Anything Can Happen Thursdays?

29
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,770
<1-17,Penny>行啊  你们当初为什么取消了
<1-17,Penny>Hey, that's good. Why'd you guys stop doing that?

30
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:20,120
<1-18,Leonard>你取笑我们  说这蠢透了
<1-18,Leonard>You made fun of us. Said it was stupid.

31
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:22,870
<1-19,Penny>听起来就像我会干的事
<1-19,Penny>Yeah. Sounds like me.

32
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,930
<1-19,Penny>来吧  谢尔顿  你觉得呢
<1-19,Penny>Come on, Sheldon. What do you say?

33
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:25,860
<1-19,Penny>好
<1-19,Penny>All right.

34
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,860
<1-20,Sheldon>我正式宣布恢复无限可能周四夜
<1-20,Sheldon>I officially reinstate Anything Can Happen Thursday.

35
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,560
<1-21,Leonard>太棒了  你想做点什么
<1-21,Leonard>Great! what do you want to do?

36
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,410
<1-21,Leonard>不知道
<1-21,Leonard>I don't know.

37
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:34,810
<1-21,Leonard>那你想做点什么
<1-21,Leonard>What do you want to do?

38
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:37,490
<1-22,Sheldon>-我也不知道  -那你想做点什么
<1-22,Sheldon>- I don't know. - What do you want to do?

39
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:39,260
<1-24,Leonard>我开始想起
<1-24,Leonard>I'm starting to remember the problem with

40
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,640
<1-24,Leonard>以前无限可能周四夜的问题了
<1-24,Leonard>Anything Can Happen Thursdays.

<2-3,Penny>有啥我们能做的免费事呢
<2-3,Penny>What could we do that's free?

55
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,810
<2-4,Sheldon>有了  我们可以叫披萨
<2-4,Sheldon>Got it! We order a pizza.

56
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,680
<2-5,Penny>你搞笑啊  你平常都这么干
<2-5,Penny>Are you kidding? That's what you always do.

57
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,490
<2-5,Penny>再努力想想
<2-5,Penny>Think harder.

58
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:26,320
<2-3,Penny>你说得对  你说得对
<2-3,Penny>You're right. You're right.

61
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,480
<2-6,Sheldon>像吃披萨那样吃

62
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,440
<2-6,Sheldon>好啦  好啦
<2-6,Sheldon>All right! All right!

63
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,490
<2-6,Sheldon>我再摇摇我的大脑智慧树  看有啥果子落下
<2-6,Sheldon>I'll shake the brain bush one more time, see what falls out.

64
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,100
<2-6,Sheldon>有了
<2-6,Sheldon>Got it!

65
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,340
<2-6,Sheldon>有个实景角色扮演组织
<2-6,Sheldon>There's a live-action role-playing group

66
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,460

00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,540
<2-8,Leonard>这样吧  我们何不放轻松
<2-8,Leonard>You know what? Why don't we just ease into this.

70
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,080
<2-8,Leonard>咱们就出去溜达溜达
<2-8,Leonard>Let-Let's go for a walk

71
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,470
<2-8,Leonard>看能不能找到家新餐厅
<2-8,Leonard>and-and-and see if we find a new restaurant.

72
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:01,320
<2-9,Sheldon>新餐厅会刚好坐落在格里菲斯公园旁吗
<2-9,Sheldon>Any chance that restaurant is near Griffith Park?

74
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:06,420
<2-11,Sheldon>-不会  -好吧

<2-12,Leonard>Raj and Howard are at Howard's mom's,

76
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,510
<2-12,Leonard>但我们要不要打电话叫上艾米跟伯纳黛特
<2-12,Leonard>but should we call the girls and see if they want to come?

77
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:12,700
<2-13,Penny>伯纳黛特今晚要加班
<2-13,Penny>No. Bernadette's working late.

78
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,050
<2-14,Sheldon>艾米生病了
<2-14,Sheldon>Amy's sick.

79
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:15,030
<2-15,Leonard>她是什么问题
<2-15,Leonard>Aw. What's wrong with her?

80
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,610
<2-16,Sheldon>她话太多
<2-16,Sheldon>Well, she talks a lot.

81
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:18,890
<2-16,Sheldon>还整天想牵手
<2-16,Sheldon>She always wants to hold hands.

82
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,380
<2-17,Leonard>我问的不是这个意思
<2-17,Leonard>That's not what I meant.

83
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,030
<2-18,Sheldon>如果你是指身体出了什么问题
<2-18,Sheldon>Well, if you were referring to her illness

84
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:24,850
<2-18,Sheldon>那你的问题应该是"她哪病了"
<2-18,Sheldon>your question should have been, "What ails her?"

85
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:28,290
<2-20,Sheldon>-"她哪病了"  -我哪知道
<2-20,Sheldon>- "What ails her?" - Oh. Who knows?

86
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:31,550
<2-21,Penny>来嘛  无限可能
<2-21,Penny>Come on, anything can happen.

87
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,630
<2-21,Penny>我们可以把他推下楼梯啊
<2-21,Penny>We can push him down the stairs!

88
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,310
<3-1,Howard>谢谢你还过来聚聚
<3-1,Howard>Hey. Thanks for coming to hang out.

89
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,280
<3-2,Raj>小意思  你妈妈病情如何
<3-2,Raj>No problem. How's your mom feeling?

90
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,630
<3-3,Howard>还行  但如果她愿意吃药会更好吧
<3-3,Howard>Okay, but she'd feel better if she took her medicine.

91
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,490
<3-4,Raj>小桂子不愿意吃药的时候
<3-4,Raj>You know, when Cinnamon won't take her medicine,

92
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:47,240
<3-4,Raj>我都把药夹在一片起司里
<3-4,Raj>I hide it in a piece of cheese.

93
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,360
<3-5,Howard>好主意  我们把药夹起司里
<3-5,Howard>Good idea. We can wrap the pill in cheese,

94
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,070
<3-5,Howard>喂小桂子吃
<3-5,Howard>feed it to Cinnamon,

95
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:52,280
<3-5,Howard>再让我妈把小桂子吃了
<3-5,Howard>and then my mom can eat Cinnamon.

96
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:56,450
<3-5,Howard>今晚想干嘛
<3-5,Howard>What do you feel like doing?

97
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:58,380
<3-6,Raj>我们可以来看个DVD
<3-6,Raj>I was thinking we could watch a DVD.

98
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:02,360
<3-7,Howard>我妈这里没太多DVD可选
<3-7,Howard>Well, my mom doesn't have a lot to choose from.

99
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:06,440
<3-7,Howard>除非你有兴趣看她的结肠镜检查纪录片
<3-7,Howard>Unless you want to watch the video of her colonoscopy.

100
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:10,510
<3-7,Howard>剧透警告  影片第20分钟  医生发现个西梅籽
<3-7,Howard>Spoiler alert: 20 minutes in, they find a prune pit.

101
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:16,650
<3-8,Raj>其实你有兴趣看电影《千尸屋》吗
<3-8,Raj>Actually, how do you feel about watching House of 1000 Corpses?

102
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,450
<3-9,Howard>你不是不看简单粗暴血腥片的吗
<3-9,Howard>A straight-up gore-fest? You hate this stuff.

103
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:21,850
<3-10,Raj>是啊  可是不知为何艾米丽喜欢看
<3-10,Raj>I do, but for some reason, Emily loves it

104
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:23,750
<3-10,Raj>还想明晚跟我一起看
<3-10,Raj>and wants to watch it with me tomorrow, so...

105
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,950
<3-10,Raj>我想如果先跟你看过
<3-10,Raj>I thought if I start with you first,

106
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:27,510
<3-10,Raj>明天跟她看时  我就能表现得很酷
<3-10,Raj>then I could act cool about it with her.

107
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,600
<3-11,Howard>这计划其实不错
<3-11,Howard>That's actually not a bad plan.

108
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,140
<3-11,Howard>像我现在也能平静看完结肠镜记录片了
<3-11,Howard>I can sit through the colonoscopy now,

109
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,340
<3-11,Howard>但第一次看时
<3-11,Howard>but that first time I was like,

110
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,430
<3-11,Howard>我还尖叫  "天啊  有西梅籽"
<3-11,Howard>"Oh, My God, a prune pit!"

111
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:42,020
<3-12,Raj>-这么说你会陪我看咯  -当然
<3-12,Raj>- Uh, so... you'd watch it? - Sure.

112
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:44,270
<3-14,Raj>你真是个好朋友  我欠你一次人情
<3-14,Raj>You're a good friend. I owe you one.

113
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,390
<9-4,Amy>霍华德
<9-4,Amy>Howard!

114
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:48,290
<3-15,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>快把我弄出浴缸
<3-15,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>Help me get out of the tub!

115
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,410
<3-16,Raj>人情不还这个
<3-16,Raj>Not that one.

116
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,310
<4-1,Sheldon>所以我们不先在网上研究一下
<4-1,Sheldon>So, we're just randomly choosing a restaurant

117
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,940
<4-1,Sheldon>就要随便找家餐馆吃饭吗
<4-1,Sheldon>without researching it online?

118
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:01,770
<4-2,Penny>是的
<4-2,Penny>Yep.

119
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:03,030
<4-2,Penny>太好了
<4-2,Penny>Great.

120
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:04,950
<4-3,Sheldon>这下无限可能周四夜要变成
<4-3,Sheldon>You know, this is how Anything Can Happen Thursday turns into

121
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:08,140
<4-3,Sheldon>无限拉稀周五日了
<4-3,Sheldon>It Won't Stop Coming Up Friday.

122
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:12,480
<4-4,Leonard>那家亚洲杂烩馆怎么样
<4-4,Leonard>Hey, how about that Asian fusion place?

123
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,250
<4-5,Sheldon>大杂烩[聚变]与亚洲人
<4-5,Sheldon>Fusion and Asians?

124
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:18,270
<4-5,Sheldon>这怎么可能让我不想到科学啊
<4-5,Sheldon>I'm trying not to think about science.

125
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:21,090
<4-6,Penny>搞什么啊
<4-6,Penny>What the hell?

126
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,220
<4-6,Penny>太过分了
<4-6,Penny>What...?

127
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,140
<4-6,Penny>她根本不是加班
<4-6,Penny>She's not working late!

128
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:27,940
<4-7,Sheldon>艾米也不是生病
<4-7,Sheldon>And Amy doesn't look sick.

129
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,500
<4-8,Penny>她们为什么要骗我们
<4-8,Penny>Why would they lie to us?

<4-9,Sheldon>Amy and Bernadette.

134
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,550
<4-9,Sheldon>你们为什么要骗我们
<4-9,Sheldon>Why did you lie to us?!

135
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,790
<5-1,Raj>你听这DVD的介绍

138
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,330
<5-2,Howard>我刚把我妈弄出浴缸
<5-2,Howard>I just helped my mom out of the tub,

139
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:57,510
<5-2,Howard>所以我比你先看了滑倒恐怖事件了
<5-2,Howard>so, I'm one slippery horror ahead of you.

140
00:05:58,730 --> 00:05:59,640
<5-3,Raj>你是一个好儿子
<5-3,Raj>You're a good son.

141
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,720
<5-3,Raj>真不知道你是怎么做到的
<5-3,Raj>I don't know how you do it.

142
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,100
<5-4,Howard>沙滩巾  朋友
<5-4,Howard>Beach blankets, my friend.

143
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,450
<5-4,Howard>诀窍就是沙滩巾
<5-4,Howard>It's all about beach blankets.

144
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:07,230
<5-5,Raj>好了  赶紧看完了事吧
<5-5,Raj>All right, let's get this over with.

<5-6,Howard>是啊  你肯定会"享受"看这部电影的
<5-6,Howard>Oh, yeah, you're gonna do great with this movie.

147
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:19,850
<6-1,Penny>你根本不是加班  为什么要骗我
<6-1,Penny>You're not working late. Why did you lie to me?

148
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:22,040
<6-2,Sheldon>艾米  你说你病了
<6-2,Sheldon>And Amy, you told me you were sick,

149
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:26,060
<6-2,Sheldon>可你脸色还跟平常一样苍白憔悴
<6-2,Sheldon>but you look just as pale and tired as always.

150
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:28,890
<6-3,Amy>对不起嘛  我只是想清静一会
<6-3,Amy>I'm sorry. I just needed a break

151
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:32,360
<6-3,Amy>不想再听你喋喋不休地说之后要研究什么
<6-3,Amy>from hearing you obsess about what to do after string theory.

152
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,470
<6-4,Bernadette>我们只是想清静一晚
<6-4,Bernadette>And we kind of just wanted one night

153
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:34,570
<6-4,Bernadette>不用再听你一直抱怨
<6-4,Bernadette>where we didn't have to hear about

154
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:37,040
<6-4,Bernadette>拍这部电影有多惨
<6-4,Bernadette>how miserable you are making this movie.

155
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,180
<6-5,Amy>但这并不意味着我们不爱你们
<6-5,Amy>But none of that means we don't love you.

156
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,920
<6-6,Penny>我才没有一直抱怨这部电影呢
<6-6,Penny>I haven't been complaining that much about the movie.

157
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,300
<6-6,Penny>有吗
<6-6,Penny>Have I?

158
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,690
<6-7,Leonard>我也爱你
<6-7,Leonard>I also love you.

159
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,130
<6-8,Penny>算了
<6-8,Penny>You know what?

160
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:54,640
<6-8,Penny>或许我才应该摆脱你们  清静一会
<6-8,Penny>Maybe I need a break from all of you.

161
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,220
<6-8,Penny>走吧  谢尔顿
<6-8,Penny>Come on, Sheldon.

162
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,160
<6-9,Sheldon>我们要去哪里
<6-9,Sheldon>Where are we going?

163
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,670
<6-9,Sheldon>我们要去共度无限可能周四夜
<6-9,Sheldon>We're gonna have Anything Can Happen Thursday,

164
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,120
<6-10,Penny>你要喋喋不休地跟我说你的科学
<6-10,Penny>you're gonna tell me all about your science stuff

165
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,620
<6-10,Penny>我要一直跟你抱怨我的电影
<6-10,Penny>and I'm gonna complain about my movie,

166
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,860
<6-10,Penny>而且我们要互相支持
<6-10,Penny>and we're gonna support each other

167
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,250
<6-10,Penny>因为朋友之间就该这样
<6-10,Penny>because that's what friends do.

168
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,950
<6-10,Penny>好吧
<6-10,Penny>Okay.

169
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,070
<6-11,Sheldon>如果要我现在选
<6-11,Sheldon>'Cause if I had to pick now,

170
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,260
<6-11,Sheldon>我可能会选暗物质  因为...
<6-11,Sheldon>I'd probably go with dark matter because...

171
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,770
<6-12,Penny>闭嘴
<6-12,Penny>Shut up.

172
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,620
<7-1,Penny>怎么了
<7-1,Penny>What's wrong?

173
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,690
<7-2,Sheldon>我看不懂我的食物
<7-2,Sheldon>I don't understand my food.

174
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:34,380
<7-2,Sheldon>中国面条加韩国烤肉
<7-2,Sheldon>Chinese noodles with Korean barbecue...

175
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:37,500
<7-2,Sheldon>一起塞进墨西哥玉米卷
<7-2,Sheldon>in a taco.

176
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,630
<7-3,Penny>这就叫杂烩啊
<7-3,Penny>It's fusion.

177
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,840
<7-4,Sheldon>如果我老妈要开车经过
<7-4,Sheldon>Well, my mother would lock her car doors

178
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,520
<7-4,Sheldon>这样的种族大杂烩区  她肯定会把车门锁死
<7-4,Sheldon>if she had to drive through this hodgepodge of ethnicity.

179
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:52,290
<7-5,Penny>你觉得我有老是在抱怨我的电影吗
<7-5,Penny>Think I've been complaining too much about the movie?

180
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:53,910
<7-6,Sheldon>完全不觉得
<7-6,Sheldon>Not at all.

181
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:55,030
<7-7,Penny>多谢
<7-7,Penny>Thank you.

182
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:56,450
<7-8,Sheldon>但老实说  每次你一开口
<7-8,Sheldon>But to be fair, when you talk,

183
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:57,830
<7-8,Sheldon>你说的大部分对我而言就是
<7-8,Sheldon>most of what you say sounds like,

184
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,470
<7-8,Sheldon>"啦啦啦  衣服"
<7-8,Sheldon>"Wah, wah, wah, clothes".

185
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:06,990
<7-9,Penny>我不懂你为什么不生艾米的气
<7-9,Penny>Hey, I don't understand why you're not upset with Amy.

186
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:08,350
<7-10,Sheldon>我气啊
<7-10,Sheldon>I am.

187
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:09,660
<7-10,Sheldon>我气到下次约会的时候
<7-10,Sheldon>So much so that I'm gonna bring her here

188
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:12,260
<7-10,Sheldon>要把她带来这里吃饭
<7-10,Sheldon>for dinner on our next date night.

189
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,380
<7-10,Sheldon>好吧
<7-10,Sheldon>Okay.

190
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,680
<8-1,Raj>在过去的20分钟里
<8-1,Raj>So, in the last 20 minutes,

191
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,790
<8-1,Raj>我们看见一个疯女人亲吻罐子中的胎儿
<8-1,Raj>we've seen a crazy woman kissing a fetus in a jar.

192
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,710
<8-1,Raj>看到一个男人被切成两半  然后缝到一条鱼上
<8-1,Raj>We've seen a guy cut in half and sewn to a fish.

193
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,570
<8-2,Howard>我们也看见我妈
<8-2,Howard>And the brutal dismemberment

194
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:40,730
<8-2,Howard>残忍地肢解了一只烤鸡
<8-2,Howard>of a rotisserie chicken by my mother.

195
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:46,330
<8-3,Raj>往好的方面想  至少她把药吃下去了
<8-3,Raj>On the bright side, she didn't even notice the pill.

196
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,400
<8-3,Raj>为什么艾米丽会喜欢这种东西
<8-3,Raj>Why does Emily like this stuff?

197
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,790
<8-3,Raj>你觉得她心理会不会有问题啊
<8-3,Raj>Do you think there's something psychologically wrong with her?

198
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,220
<8-4,Howard>有问题又怎么样
<8-4,Howard>What difference does it make?

199
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,530
<8-5,Raj>-这话什么意思  -拜托
<8-5,Raj>- What do you mean? - Oh, come on--

200
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:58,860
<8-6,Howard>就算她冰箱里装满了前男友的各个身体部位
<8-6,Howard>she could have a freezer full of ex-boyfriend's body parts

201
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,150
<8-6,Howard>你还是照样跟她约会
<8-6,Howard>and you'd still go out with her.

202
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:05,100
<8-7,Raj>不会有前男友来纠缠的确深得我心
<8-7,Raj>I do like that the ex-boyfriend's out of the picture.

203
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:11,030
<9-1,Amy>欺骗谢尔顿让我感觉好内疚
<9-1,Amy>I feel so bad about lying to Sheldon.

204
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,980
<9-1,Amy>我怎么才能弥补过错呢
<9-1,Amy>How am I gonna make it up to him?

205
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,620
<9-2,Bernadette>我能教你我对付霍华德的办法
<9-2,Bernadette>I'd tell you what I do with Howard,

206
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,780
<9-2,Bernadette>可我觉得打扮成天主教女学生
<9-2,Bernadette>but I don't think dressing up like a Catholic schoolgirl

207
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:19,100
<9-2,Bernadette>哄不了谢尔顿开心
<9-2,Bernadette>is gonna work with Sheldon.

208
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:25,020
<9-3,Leonard>他估计会给你布置家庭作业
<9-3,Leonard>He'd probably give you homework.

209
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:31,690
<9-4,Amy>-你今晚也对霍华德说谎了吗  -当然
<9-4,Amy>- Did you lie to Howard about tonight? - Of course.

210
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:33,550
<9-6,Amy>那你一点也不内疚吗
<9-6,Amy>And you don't feel guilty about it?

211
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,080
<9-7,Bernadette>夹在佩妮的大猩猩电影
<9-7,Bernadette>Between Penny's gorilla movie

212
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,300
<9-7,Bernadette>和华仔的大猩猩老妈之间  我别无选择啊
<9-7,Bernadette>and Howard's gorilla mother, I had no choice.

213
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,720
<9-8,Leonard>幸好我和佩妮一直是坦诚相对
<9-8,Leonard>Thankfully Penny and I have a relationship based on honesty.

214
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,830
<9-8,Leonard>怎么了  我可从来不骗她
<9-8,Leonard>What? I don't lie to her.

215
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:49,340
<9-9,Bernadette>我们知道你是没有骗她啦
<9-9,Bernadette>Oh, we know you don't lie to her.

216
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,280
<9-9,Bernadette>谢了
<9-9,Bernadette>Thank you.

217
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,360
<10-1,Penny>没准你未来课题的答案
<10-1,Penny>Hey, maybe the answer to your career question

218
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,180
<10-1,Penny>就在这些幸运饼干里呢
<10-1,Penny>is in one of these.

219
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,940
<10-2,Sheldon>佩妮  世上只有一种饼干
<10-2,Sheldon>Penny, there's only one cookie with something

220
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:06,180
<10-2,Sheldon>中间夹有能解除人生烦恼的东西
<10-2,Sheldon>in the middle that solves life's problems,

221
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,510
<10-2,Sheldon>它的名字叫奥利奥
<10-2,Sheldon>and that's an Oreo.

222
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:13,520
<10-2,Sheldon>必要时  花生甜饼也可以
<10-2,Sheldon>Or a Nutter Butter, if you're in a pinch.

223
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,170
<10-3,Penny>拜托  打开看看嘛  里面肯定有什么好话
<10-3,Penny>Come on, open it. I bet it says something great.

224
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:18,380
<10-4,Sheldon>我们身在一家亚洲杂烩馆
<10-4,Sheldon>This is Asian fusion.

225
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:22,130
<10-4,Sheldon>搞不好里面跳出来个小吉娃娃呢
<10-4,Sheldon>For all you know, there's a tiny Chihuahua in here.

226
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:24,280
<10-5,Penny>算了  我先打开吧
<10-5,Penny>Fine, I'll go.

227
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:28,940
<10-5,Penny>"周围的人都求助于你的智慧和开导"
<10-5,Penny>"People turn to you for guidance and wisdom."

228
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,270
<10-5,Penny>这话不错
<10-5,Penny>Yeah, that's a good one.

229
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:32,440
<10-6,Sheldon>不错才怪
<10-6,Sheldon>No, it's not.

230
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,920
<10-7,Penny>这有什么奇怪的
<10-7,Penny>How is that not good?

231
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,620
<10-8,Sheldon>"求助于你的智慧"
<10-8,Sheldon>"Turn to you for wisdom"?

232
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:38,840
<10-8,Sheldon>这饼干明显是在讽刺你
<10-8,Sheldon>Clearly, that cookie is mocking you.

233
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:43,320
<10-8,Sheldon>花生甜饼就从来不会对人这么无礼
<10-8,Sheldon>You'd never hear that kind of sass from a Nutter Butter.

234
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,740
<10-9,Penny>看在这顿饭钱是你付的份上  我就不计较了
<10-9,Penny>Uh, since you're paying for dinner, I'll let that slide.

235
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,390
<10-9,Penny>看看你的吧
<10-9,Penny>Open yours.

236
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,690
<10-10,Sheldon>你有曾经自己付过饭钱吗
<10-10,Sheldon>Have you ever paid for a meal?

237
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:53,020
<10-11,Penny>没用钱付过  快念
<10-11,Penny>Not with money. Read.

238
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:59,320
<10-12,Sheldon>"你温暖又欢乐的气质感染了身边的人"
<10-12,Sheldon>"Your warm and fun-loving nature delights those around you."

239
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,350
<10-13,Penny>不准  下一个
<10-13,Penny>Oh, try again.

240
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:14,390
<11-1,Howard>我们来理一理
<11-1,Howard>Let me get this straight.

241
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:17,370
<11-1,Howard>他杀了那女孩的亲爹
<11-1,Howard>So, he kills this girl's father,

242
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:19,260
<11-1,Howard>剥下他的脸皮
<11-1,Howard>cuts off the guy's face,

243
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,290
<11-1,Howard>把它戴在脸上
<11-1,Howard>and is wearing it as a mask

244
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:23,890
<11-1,Howard>和那女孩亲热
<11-1,Howard>while he makes out with her.

245
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,240
<11-2,Raj>有句话我不得不说
<11-2,Raj>I'm just gonna say it.

246
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,810
<11-2,Raj>这样做是不对的

<12-2,Sheldon>你在开玩笑吧
<12-2,Sheldon>You can't be serious.

259
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,300
<12-2,Sheldon>如果我想用无聊事打发时间
<12-2,Sheldon>If I wanted to waste my time on nonsense,

<12-4,Sheldon>Or someone set a hippie on fire.

<13-1,Bernadette (on phone)>亲爱的  我还在加班呢
<13-1,Bernadette (on phone)>Yeah, honey, I'm still stuck at work.

<13-1,Bernadette (on phone)>真的吗
<13-1,Bernadette (on phone)>Really?

266
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,240

<13-2,Leonard>我俩还从来没单独出来玩过呢
<13-2,Leonard>You and I never just hang out like this.

271
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:55,300
<13-2,Leonard>为什么呢
<13-2,Leonard>Why is that?

272
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,150
<13-3,Amy>-我懂  真奇怪对不对  -对
<13-3,Amy>- I know, it's weird, right? - Yeah.

273
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,230
<13-4,Leonard>我们该多出来玩一玩
<13-4,Leonard>We should do it more often.

274
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:01,420
<13-5,Amy>不  我是说  现在这样感觉很奇怪
<13-5,Amy>Oh, no. I mean, this is weird right now.

275
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:05,600
<13-6,Leonard>是佩妮发的
<13-6,Leonard>Ah, it's Penny.

276
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,630
<13-7,Amy>她还在生气吗
<13-7,Amy>Is she still mad?

277
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:08,060
<13-8,Leonard>貌似没生气了
<13-8,Leonard>Oh, doesn't seem like it.

278
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:10,650
<13-8,Leonard>她把谢尔顿带去见算命师了
<13-8,Leonard>She got Sheldon to go to a psychic with her.

279
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:12,090
<13-9,Amy>算命师
<13-9,Amy>A psychic?

280
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:14,190
<13-9,Amy>他觉得算命师不光是狗屁不通
<13-9,Amy>He considers them not just mumbo jumbo,

281
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:17,700
<13-9,Amy>还是最狗屁不通的狗屁不通
<13-9,Amy>but extra-jumbo mumbo jumbo.

282
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,380
<13-10,Leonard>佩妮挺会说服人的
<13-10,Leonard>Well, Penny can be pretty persuasive.

283
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:23,250
<13-10,Leonard>她让我做了好多平时不会做的事
<13-10,Leonard>She's gotten me to do a lot of things I wouldn't normally do.

284
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,640
<13-11,Amy>那是因为她让你跟她上床
<13-11,Amy>Because she has sex with you.

285
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,130
<13-12,Leonard>这是真的
<13-12,Leonard>Yeah, she does.

286
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,930
<13-13,Amy>我可以坦白一件事吗
<13-13,Amy>Can I confess something?

287
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:31,440
<13-13,Amy>有时候  我有点小嫉妒
<13-13,Amy>Once in a while, I get a little jealous

288
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,590
<13-13,Amy>佩妮和谢尔顿之间关系这么好
<13-13,Amy>of how close Penny and Sheldon are.

289
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:35,010
<13-14,Leonard>真的吗
<13-14,Leonard>Really?

290
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:36,610
<13-15,Amy>我知道他们不是暧昧
<13-15,Amy>I mean, not in a romantic way.

291
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:39,730
<13-15,Amy>只是  她跟谢尔顿互相颇有默契
<13-15,Amy>It's just, she really has some sort of connection with him.

292
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:42,370
<13-16,Leonard>这个嘛  他们认识已经很久了
<13-16,Leonard>Well... Well, they've known each other a long time,

293
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,690
<13-16,Leonard>而且佩妮从小和马一起长大
<13-16,Leonard>and Penny grew up around horses,

294
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:48,130
<13-16,Leonard>所以她懂得如何靠近又不吓到他
<13-16,Leonard>so she knows how to approach him without making him skittish.

295
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:50,600
<13-17,Amy>你不要误解了  我很高兴他们关系好
<13-17,Amy>Don't get me wrong. I'm glad they're friends.

296
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:54,080
<13-17,Amy>我只是希望他在我身边也能那么放松
<13-17,Amy>I just wish he'd be that comfortable around me already.

297
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,820
<13-18,Leonard>他也是花了很长时间  才能在我身边那么放松
<13-18,Leonard>Well, it took him a long time to get comfortable around me, too.

298
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,870
<13-19,Amy>真的吗  你做了什么
<13-19,Amy>Really? What did you do?

299
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:03,390
<13-20,Leonard>上辈子作恶太多吧  我也不清楚
<13-20,Leonard>Something terrible in a former life? I don't know.

300
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:05,910
<13-21,Bernadette>我得走了
<13-21,Bernadette>I gotta go.

301
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,200
<13-21,Bernadette>佩妮把我出卖了
<13-21,Bernadette>Penny ratted me out.

302
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,250
<13-21,Bernadette>对了  你生日她准备送你手表
<13-21,Bernadette>FYI, she's getting you a watch for your birthday

303
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,640
<13-21,Bernadette>钱是从你钱包里拿的
<13-21,Bernadette>with money she took out of your wallet.

304
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:20,280
<14-1,Sheldon>我不是有意这么无礼粗鲁
<14-1,Sheldon>I don't mean to be rude or discourteous,

305
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,760
<14-1,Sheldon>但在开始前  我想说
<14-1,Sheldon>but before we begin, I'd just like to say

306
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,370
<14-1,Sheldon>绝对没有任何科学证据
<14-1,Sheldon>there is absolutely no scientific evidence

307
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:27,920
<14-1,Sheldon>支持任何形式的灵力
<14-1,Sheldon>to support clairvoyance of any kind.

308
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:29,590
<14-1,Sheldon>就是说
<14-1,Sheldon>Which means--

309
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:32,250
<14-1,Sheldon>再说一遍  我不是故意无礼
<14-1,Sheldon>and again, no insult intended--

310
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,060
<14-1,Sheldon>但你是个骗子
<14-1,Sheldon>but you're a fraud...

311
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:36,960
<14-1,Sheldon>你的职业是骗局
<14-1,Sheldon>...your profession is a swindle,

312
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,020
<14-1,Sheldon>你的生计取决于
<14-1,Sheldon>and, uh, your livelihood is dependent

313
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:41,600
<14-1,Sheldon>愚蠢人类的轻易受骗程度
<14-1,Sheldon>on the gullibility of stupid people.

314
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,410
<14-1,Sheldon>再说一遍  我无意冒犯
<14-1,Sheldon>Again, no offense.

315
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:47,730
<14-2,Penny>谢尔顿  问她问题吧
<14-2,Penny>All right, Sheldon, just ask your question.

316
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,460
<14-3,Sheldon>我刚问了  是什么问题
<14-3,Sheldon>Okay, I just did. What was it?

317

<14-4,Penny>我的天

<14-4,Penny>Look, he's a physicist who's trying to figure out

319
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:58,160
<14-4,Penny>他下一个研究领域是什么
<14-4,Penny>what his next field of study should be.

320
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,220
<14-5,Sheldon>我得告诉你
<14-5,Sheldon>For your information,

<14-5,Sheldon>我问的是下一部《星际迷航》的电影
<14-5,Sheldon>I was asking her about the next Star Trek movie.

322
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:05,520
<14-6,Penny>我可以回答  《星际迷航之我会无聊死》
<14-6,Penny>Okay, I can answer that one: I'll be bored.

323
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:09,190
<14-7,Psychic>好了  我们开始吧
<14-7,Psychic>All right, why don't we begin?

<14-8,Sheldon>That's an easy guess.

327
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,090
<14-8,Sheldon>我一看就是个烦人精
<14-8,Sheldon>I'm clearly an annoying person

328
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:28,910
<14-8,Sheldon>无论男女都看我不爽
<14-8,Sheldon>and have problems with both genders.

345
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:16,110
<14-18,Psychic>他应该全心投入到这段感情中
<14-18,Psychic>He should give himself to this relationship.

346
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,080
<14-18,Psychic>一旦全心投入
<14-18,Psychic>Once he does,

361
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,920
<15-2,Emily>告诉你
<15-2,Emily>Now, just so you know,

362
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,880
<15-2,Emily>我做过三年保姆  如果你害怕
<15-2,Emily>I was a nanny for three years, so if you get scared,

363
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,960
<15-2,Emily>我可以帮你换吓尿的纸尿裤
<15-2,Emily>I can totally change your diaper.

364
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:14,640
<15-3,Raj>我必须跟你说件事
<15-3,Raj>Actually, I have to tell you something.

365
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,480
<15-3,Raj>这类电影我实在是不喜欢
<15-3,Raj>These kind of movies really aren't my thing,

366
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,560
<15-3,Raj>所以昨晚我看了
<15-3,Raj>so, last night, I watched it

367
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,270
<15-3,Raj>为了提前给自己做点心理准备
<15-3,Raj>just to see what I was getting myself into.

368
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:22,190
<15-4,Emily>好的
<15-4,Emily>Okay.

369
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:23,500
<15-5,Raj>我得说实话
<15-5,Raj>And I have to be honest--

370
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:27,110
<15-5,Raj>我觉得这电影让人心里发毛  感觉怪异
<15-5,Raj>I thought it was disturbing and weird,

371
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:30,020
<15-5,Raj>让我不禁怀疑  怎么会有人喜欢看这种电影呢
<15-5,Raj>and it made me wonder what it says about someone who enjoys it.

372
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,740
<15-6,Emily>我也怀疑
<15-6,Emily>I wonder that, too.

373
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:34,280
<15-7,Raj>那你为什么看这种电影
<15-7,Raj>Then, why do you watch these things?

374
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,600
<15-8,Emily>我跟你说件事  你别戴有色眼镜看我好吗
<15-8,Emily>Can I tell you something without you judging me?

375
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,920
<15-9,Raj>好的
<15-9,Raj>Sure.

376
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:41,200
<15-10,Emily>这类电影让我性趣盎然
<15-10,Emily>They kind of turn me on.

377
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,980
<15-11,Raj>马上播放
<15-11,Raj>And play.

378
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,240
<16-1,Sheldon>你好
<16-1,Sheldon>Hello.

379
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,630
<16-1,Sheldon>我没想到今晚你会来
<16-1,Sheldon>I didn't expect you this evening.

380
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:01,000
<16-2,Amy>那晚对你说谎
<16-2,Amy>Well, I was just feeling so bad

381
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,800
<16-2,Amy>我好内疚
<16-2,Amy>about lying to you the other night,

382
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:05,550
<16-2,Amy>我想补偿你
<16-2,Amy>I wanted to make it up to you.

383
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:08,830
<16-3,Sheldon>你打算怎么补偿
<16-3,Sheldon>And how do you propose to do that?

384
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:21,820
<16-3,Sheldon>除非你裙子下面有《地心引力》的蓝光碟
<16-3,Sheldon>Unless you have Gravity on Blu-ray under that skirt,

385
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:24,850
<16-3,Sheldon>不然我实在不知道你在闹哪样
<16-3,Sheldon>I don't know where you're going with this.
