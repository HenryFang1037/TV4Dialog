8
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,930
<1-3,Penny>干嘛不要
<1-3,Penny>Why not?

9
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,430
<1-4,Sheldon>佩妮  我支持"多个世界"理论
<1-4,Sheldon>Penny, while I subscribe to

10
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,930
<1-4,Sheldon>这个理论表明
<1-4,Sheldon>The "many worlds" theory which pots the existence

11
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:38,530
<1-4,Sheldon>在无限个宇宙中存在着
<1-4,Sheldon>Of an infinite number of sheldons

12
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,200
<1-4,Sheldon>无限个谢尔顿
<1-4,Sheldon>In an infinite number of universes,

13
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:43,620
<1-4,Sheldon>我向你保证其中没一个"我"是在跳舞的
<1-4,Sheldon>I assure you that in none of them am I dancing.

14
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:47,940
<1-5,Penny>那这些"你"里有没有幽默一点的
<1-5,Penny>Are you fun in any of them?

15
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:48,860
<1-6,Sheldon>根据推算
<1-6,Sheldon>The math would suggest

16
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,630
<1-6,Sheldon>其中有几个"我"是糖娃娃
<1-6,Sheldon>That in a few I'm a clown made of candy.

17
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:54,590
<1-6,Sheldon>但是绝不跳舞
<1-6,Sheldon>But I don't dance.

18
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,870
<1-7,Penny>行吧  来点法式吐司不
<1-7,Penny>Alright, want some French toast?

19
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,970
<1-8,Sheldon>今天是燕麦粥日
<1-8,Sheldon>It's oatmeal day.

20
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:03,440
<1-9,Penny>这样吧  下个法式吐司日  我给你煮燕麦粥
<1-9,Penny>Tell you what, next French toast day, I'll make you oatmeal.

21
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:07,140
<1-10,Sheldon>神啊  你还要在这赖到法式吐司日啊
<1-10,Sheldon>Dear lord, are you still going to be here on French toast day?

22
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,570
<1-11,Leonard>早啊
<1-11,Leonard>Morning.

23
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,550
<1-12,Sheldon>莱纳德  你看啊
<1-12,Sheldon>Look, Leonard,

24
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,490
<1-12,Sheldon>佩妮烤了法式吐司
<1-12,Sheldon>Penny made French toast.

25
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:17,890
<1-13,Leonard>抱歉我还没给她你的用餐日程表
<1-13,Leonard>Sorry I haven't given her your schedule yet.

26
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,520
<1-14,Sheldon>那是个iCal[Apple电子日程表]下载啊
<1-14,Sheldon>It's an iCal download.

27
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:21,260
<1-14,Sheldon>她可以直接下到手机里的
<1-14,Sheldon>She can put it right in her phone.

28
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:22,980
<1-14,Sheldon>而且我想咱们说好了的
<1-14,Sheldon>And I thought we agreed

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,580
<1-14,Sheldon>你们只在她那儿行房事
<1-14,Sheldon>That you'd have your conjugal visits in her apartment.

30
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:28,500
<1-15,Leonard>是说好了  但是现在是特殊情况
<1-15,Leonard>We did, but there were extenuating circumstances.

31
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:29,570
<1-16,Sheldon>我明白了
<1-16,Sheldon>I see.

32
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,030
<1-16,Sheldon>她浑身的傻气
<1-16,Sheldon>Did her abysmal housekeeping skills

33
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,840
<1-16,Sheldon>终于被她那盖世的家务活能力打压下去了是吗
<1-16,Sheldon>Finally trump her perkiness?

34
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:39,080
<1-17,Leonard>不  是她的床有点散架了
<1-17,Leonard>No, her bed kind of... Broke.

35
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,410
<1-18,Sheldon>这是不太可能的
<1-18,Sheldon>That doesn't seem likely.

36
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,730
<1-18,Sheldon>她的床的构造很结实
<1-18,Sheldon>Her bed's of sturdy construction.

37
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,620
<1-18,Sheldon>就算多承重一个
<1-18,Sheldon>Even the addition of a second

38
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,300
<1-20,Leonard>正常体型的人类也不会引致其床架松动的
<1-20,Leonard>Normal size human being wouldn't cause a structural failure,

39
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:49,170
<1-19,Penny>更别提像你这样的小雏形人了
<1-19,Penny>Much less a homunculus such as yourself.

40
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:52,610
<1-19,Penny>小雏形人
<1-19,Penny>A homunculus?

41
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:56,030
<1-20,Leonard>功能健全的迷你型人类
<1-20,Leonard>Perfectly formed miniature human being.

42
00:01:56,110 --> 00:02:00,430
<1-21,Penny>你这我的小宝贝雏形人
<1-21,Penny>Oh, you're my little homunculus.

43
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,000
<1-22,Leonard>别这样
<1-22,Leonard>Don't do that.

44
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:03,950
<1-22,Leonard>抱歉
<1-22,Leonard>Sorry.

45
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,600
<1-23,Penny>好啦  谁要普通糖浆谁要肉桂糖浆呀
<1-23,Penny>Okay, who wants syrup and who wants cinnamon sugar?

46
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:06,790
<1-24,Sheldon>我要燕麦粥
<1-24,Sheldon>I want oatmeal.

47
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:07,960
<1-25,Penny>行啊
<1-25,Penny>Yes, well

48
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:10,160
<1-25,Penny>我想要个室友不是大混蛋的男朋友
<1-25,Penny>I want a boyfriend whose roommate isn't a giant pain in the ass.

49
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,840
<1-26,Sheldon>这个愿望很快就能实现了
<1-26,Sheldon>I'm sure that will happen soon enough.

50
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,980
<1-26,Sheldon>但我还是要燕麦粥
<1-26,Sheldon>But in the meantime, I still want oatmeal.

51
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:18,680
<1-27,Penny>得了  我投降
<1-27,Penny>You know what, I give up.

52
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,880
<1-27,Penny>怎么会有他这种人
<1-27,Penny>He's impossible.

53
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,740
<1-28,Sheldon>怎么会没有  我就是存在的
<1-28,Sheldon>I can't be impossible, I exist.

54
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,590
<1-28,Sheldon>我相信你想说的是
<1-28,Sheldon>I believe what you meant to say is,

55
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,120
<1-27,Penny>"我投降  这种人几乎是不存在的"
<1-27,Penny>"I give up, he's improbable."

56
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,780
<1-29,Leonard>谢尔顿  你真得换个方式
<1-29,Leonard>Sheldon, you really need to find a better way

57
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,030
<1-29,Leonard>和佩妮相处了
<1-29,Leonard>Of dealing with penny.

58
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,270
<1-30,Sheldon>那我该怎么做
<1-30,Sheldon>What am I supposed to do--

59
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,070
<1-30,Sheldon>在礼拜一吃法式吐司吗
<1-30,Sheldon>Eat french toast on a Monday?

60
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,770
<1-30,Sheldon>这种情况才是不存在的
<1-30,Sheldon>Now, that would be impossible.

61
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,460
<1-31,Leonard>我只是说  你想抓苍蝇的话得用蜂蜜
<1-31,Leonard>I'm just saying, you can catch more flies with honey

62
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:45,660
<1-31,Leonard>而不是醋
<1-31,Leonard>Than with vinegar.

63
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:47,780
<1-32,Sheldon>你用粪粪还能抓更多呢
<1-32,Sheldon>You can catch even more flies with manure.

64
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,150
<1-32,Sheldon>你到底想说什么
<1-32,Sheldon>What's your point?

65
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,780
<1-33,Leonard>这个...
<1-33,Leonard>It's a...

66
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:57,590
<1-34,Sheldon>天  还挺香的呢
<1-34,Sheldon>Boy, that does smell good.

67
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,040
<1-34,Sheldon>太遗憾了  今儿就是礼拜一
<1-34,Sheldon>Too bad it's Monday.

68
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,800
<1-34,Sheldon>生活大爆炸
<1-34,Sheldon>第三季第三集

69
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,710
<2-1,Penny>我们经理基姆去休产假了
<2-1,Penny>Okay, Kim the night manager went on maternity leave

70
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,430
<2-1,Penny>她老公叫桑迪
<2-1,Penny>And her husband's name is Sandy, right?

71
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,700
<2-1,Penny>然后
<2-1,Penny>So get this--

72
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:34,990
<2-1,Penny>顶她班的是一个叫桑迪的女人
<2-1,Penny>Her replacement is a woman named Sandy

73
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:37,360
<2-1,Penny>而她老公叫基姆
<2-1,Penny>Whose husband's name is Kim.

74
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,780
<2-3,Penny>-哇啊  -是啊
<2-3,Penny>- Wow!  - I know!

75
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,640
<2-3,Penny>这什么概率哦
<2-3,Penny>What are the odds?

76
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:45,700
<2-4,Sheldon>很好算嘛
<2-4,Sheldon>Easily calculable.

77
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,620
<2-4,Sheldon>先找到几对双方都取中性名字的
<2-4,Sheldon>We begin by identifying a set of married couples

78
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,020
<2-4,Sheldon>已婚夫妇
<2-4,Sheldon>With unisex names.

79
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:50,400
<2-4,Sheldon>然后剔除那些不适合
<2-4,Sheldon>We then eliminate those unqualified

80
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:51,120
<2-4,Sheldon>从事餐饮工作的
<2-4,Sheldon>For restaurant work--

81
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,720
<2-4,Sheldon>比如说年老的  坐牢的  残疾的
<2-4,Sheldon>The aged, the imprisoned and the limbless, for example,

82
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,910
<2-4,Sheldon>-再然后就  -谢尔顿
<2-4,Sheldon>- Next we look at... - Sheldon--

83
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:57,580
<2-5,Leonard>这是一个奇妙的巧合
<2-5,Leonard>It's an amazing coincidence.

84
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,130
<2-5,Leonard>就这样了行吗
<2-5,Leonard>Can we leave it at that?

85
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,330
<2-5,Leonard>对不起
<2-5,Leonard>I'm sorry.

86
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,830
<2-6,Sheldon>喔佩妮  你们奶酪蛋糕工厂就好像是巫婆们开的
<2-6,Sheldon>Ooh, Penny. It's as if the cheese-cake factory is run by witches.

87
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:13,910
<2-7,Penny>喔谢尔顿  别以为我不会揍你
<2-7,Penny>Ooh, Sheldon, it's as if you don't think I'll punch you.

88
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,350
<2-8,Leonard>行啦  你俩  别吵了
<2-8,Leonard>Come on, you guys, let it go.

89
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,530
<2-9,Penny>哼  随便吧
<2-9,Penny>Fine, whatever.

90
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:21,020
<2-9,Penny>你吃完了吗
<2-9,Penny>Are you finished?

91
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,480
<2-10,Sheldon>谢了
<2-10,Sheldon>Well, thank you.

92
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,400
<2-10,Sheldon>多么体贴
<2-10,Sheldon>How thoughtful.

93
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:26,400
<2-10,Sheldon>你要吃巧克力吗
<2-10,Sheldon>Would you like a chocolate?

94
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:28,370
<2-11,Penny>好啊
<2-11,Penny>Um, yeah, sure.

95
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,080
<2-11,Penny>多谢啦
<2-11,Penny>Thanks.

96
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,430
<2-12,Leonard>这算什么
<2-12,Leonard>What was that?

97
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,220
<2-13,Sheldon>你让我对佩妮好点的
<2-13,Sheldon>You said be nice to Penny.

98
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,000
<2-13,Sheldon>我觉得给别人喂巧克力
<2-13,Sheldon>I believe offering chocolate to someone

99
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:44,270
<2-13,Sheldon>能够符合"好"的定义
<2-13,Sheldon>Falls within the definition of nice.

100
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,690
<2-14,Leonard>没错
<2-14,Leonard>It does.

101
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,360
<2-14,Leonard>但就我观察  你这人不符合
<2-14,Leonard>But in my experience, you don't.

102
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:51,980

<2-26,Sheldon>才怪呢
<2-26,Sheldon>Bazinga!

127
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:00,650
<2-26,Sheldon>没有人能察觉到我的玩笑  对吧
<2-26,Sheldon>None of you ever see my practical jokes coming, do you?

128
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,580
<2-27,Howard>你们俩去吗
<2-27,Howard>Okay, how about you two?

129
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:05,200
<2-27,Howard>我还带了几个纹身袖
<2-27,Howard>Look, I've got some extra tatoo sleeves.

130
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:07,320
<2-28,Leonard>你带那么多干什么
<2-28,Leonard>Why are you carrying extras?

131
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:10,330
<2-29,Howard>万一被哪个女人的乳环刮破了好有个替换呀
<2-29,Howard>In case I snag one on someone's nipple ring.

132
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:12,930
<2-30,Penny>我们就不去了
<2-30,Penny>Uh, yeah, I think we'll pass.

133
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
<2-31,Howard>你现在就得"妻管严"了吗
<2-31,Howard>Oh, is the missus speaking for the couple now?

134
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:21,100
<2-32,Leonard>这件事  肯定她说了算
<2-32,Leonard>In this case, you bet she is.

135
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,890
<2-33,Howard (after Raj whispers)>是啊  她很强势  他受压迫
<2-33,Howard (after Raj whispers)>Yes, she's pushy, and yes, he's whipped,

136
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:29,730
<2-33,Howard (after Raj whispers)>但是不能这么说
<2-33,Howard (after Raj whispers)>But that's not the expression.

137
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:33,650
<2-33,Howard (after Raj whispers)>快走  我要去沃尔格林药店
<2-33,Howard (after Raj whispers)>Come on, I want to stop at walgreens

138
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:35,520
<2-33,Howard (after Raj whispers)>再多买几支眼线笔
<2-33,Howard (after Raj whispers)>And pick up some more eyeliner.

139
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:42,690
<2-34,Leonard>他们在夜总会要被揍了
<2-34,Leonard>They're gonna get beaten up at that club.

140
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,890
<2-34,Leonard>我看他们在药店就会被揍
<2-34,Leonard>They're gonna get beaten up at walgreens.

141
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,470
<2-35,Penny>抱歉  谢尔顿
<2-35,Penny>Oh, sorry, Sheldon.

142
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:51,870
<2-35,Penny>我差点坐在你的专座上
<2-35,Penny>I almost sat in your spot.

143
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:54,720
<2-36,Sheldon>是吗  我都没注意
<2-36,Sheldon>Did you? I didn't notice.

144
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,670
<2-36,Sheldon>给你块巧克力吧
<2-36,Sheldon>Have a chocolate.

145

<2-37,Penny>谢谢
<2-37,Penny>Thank you.

146
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,870
<3-1,Raj>我觉得我们很适合这里
<3-1,Raj>I think we're fitting quite nicely.

147
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:19,940
<3-2,Howard>要是你不喝低度啤酒就更好了
<3-2,Howard>It did help if you weren't drinking light beer.

148
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:23,130
<3-3,Raj>喝伏特加和蔓越莓果汁就显得比我更有哥特风格吗
<3-3,Raj>What's so gothic about vodka and cranberry juice?

149
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:25,750
<3-4,Howard>是啊  这看起来像在饮血
<3-4,Howard>Hello? It looks like blood.

150
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,620
<3-4,Howard>你没去看我发给你的
<3-4,Howard>Did you even read the "wiki how" link

151
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:29,330
<3-4,Howard>手把手学哥特风格的WikiHow链接吗
<3-4,Howard>I sent you on being goth?

152
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:32,000
<3-5,Raj>没  我自己的东西还看不玩呢
<3-5,Raj>No, I'm behind on my wiki-reading.

153
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:34,810
<3-5,Raj>我正在读约翰·格里沙姆[法律惊悚小说《掮客》作者]
<3-5,Raj>I'm kind of on a John Grisham kick right now.

154
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:35,890
<3-6,Howard>什么
<3-6,Howard>What?

155
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:37,920
<3-7,Raj>我看完了《绝对机密》
<3-7,Raj>I finished reading The Pelican Brief

156
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,400
<3-7,Raj>我太喜欢了  已经完全身临其境了
<3-7,Raj>And loved it so much, I dived right into the client.

157
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,430
<3-7,Raj>他本身就是个律师
<3-7,Raj>He was a lawyer himself,

158
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:45,130
<3-7,Raj>所以他的小说内容的准确性和娱乐性都很强
<3-7,Raj>So his novels are accurate as well as entertaining.

159
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:50,940
<3-8,Howard>要记住  我们是浪荡子  暗夜之子
<3-8,Howard>Just remember we are lost boys, children of the night.

<3-11,Howard>I'm actually much more lost than he is.

00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,790
<3-23,Second girl>反正也没人关心
<3-23,Second girl>Not that anyone cares.

179
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:45,880
<3-24,Raj>两位小姐喜欢看约翰·格里沙姆的小说吗
<3-24,Raj>Do either of you ladies enjoy the novels of John Grisham?

181
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:01,040
<4-2,Leonard>恶魔武士
<4-2,Leonard>Oshikuru: Demon samurai.

182
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,690
<4-3,Sheldon>恶魔武士不是动画片
<4-3,Sheldon>Demon it's not a cartoon.

183
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:05,000
<4-3,Sheldon>是动漫
<4-3,Sheldon>It'anime.

184

<4-3,Sheldon>动漫
<4-3,Sheldon>Anime.

185
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:09,070
<4-4,Penny>高中时有个女生叫安娜·梅(Anime和Anna May谐音)
<4-4,Penny>You know, I knew a girl in high school named Anna May.

186
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:12,650
<4-4,Penny>安娜·梅·弗莱彻
<4-4,Penny>Anna May Fletcher.

00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:15,710
<4-4,Penny>她天生单鼻孔

00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,780
<4-4,Penny>她后来的整鼻手术很失败
<4-4,Penny>Then she had this bad nose job

189
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,780
<4-4,Penny>最后竟然弄成了三个鼻孔
<4-4,Penny>And basically wound up with three.

190

<4-5,Sheldon>你现在经常混在这儿了
<4-5,Sheldon>You're here a lot now.

<4-8,Penny>Let me take this in the hall.

199
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:01,000
<4-8,Penny>你绝对想不到他们找谁来接替你的工作
<4-8,Penny>You'll never guess who they got to replace you at work.

200
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:06,010
<4-9,Leonard>我知道你在干什么了
<4-9,Leonard>Okay, I know what you're doing.

201
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:07,480
<4-10,Sheldon>真的吗
<4-10,Sheldon>Really?

202
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,460
<4-11,Leonard>你在用巧克力做正面教法
<4-11,Leonard>Yes, you're ung chocolates as positive reinforcement

203
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:13,930
<4-11,Leonard>对你认为良好的行为进行奖励
<4-11,Leonard>For what you consider correct behavior.

204
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,790
<4-12,Sheldon>真聪明
<4-12,Sheldon>Very good.

205
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:19,750
<4-12,Sheldon>来块巧克力吗
<4-12,Sheldon>Chocole?

206
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,840
<4-13,Leonard>我不想要什么巧克力
<4-13,Leonard>No, I don't want any chocolate!

207
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:25,600
<1-1,Penny>谢尔顿
<1-1,Penny>Sheldon,

208
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:30,600
<4-13,Leonard>你不能拿我女朋友当实验鼠一样对待
<4-13,Leonard>You can't train my girlfend like a lab rat.

209
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,500
<4-14,Sheldon>事实证明  我可以
<4-14,Sheldon>Actually, it turns out I can.

210
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,440
<4-15,Leonard>你不应该这么做
<4-15,Leonard>well, you shouldn't.

211
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,570
<4-16,Sheldon>莱纳德  就是没法让你满意  是吧
<4-16,Sheldon>There's just no pleasing you, is there, Leonard?

212
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,790
<4-16,Sheldon>你不满意
<4-16,Sheldon>You weren't happy

213
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,780
<4-16,Sheldon>我之前那样对她
<4-16,Sheldon>With my previous approach to dealing with her,

214
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:44,550
<4-16,Sheldon>所以我决定根据桑代克和B.F.斯金纳的理论
<4-16,Sheldon>So I decided to employ operant conditioning techniques,

215
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,780
<4-16,Sheldon>采取操作性条件反射的办法
<4-16,Sheldon>Building on the works of thorndike and B.F. Skinner.

216
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:48,330
<4-16,Sheldon>下周的这个时候
<4-16,Sheldon>By this time next week,

217
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,720
<4-16,Sheldon>我相信我能让她从水池里一跃而出
<4-16,Sheldon>I believe I can have her jumping out of a pool,

218
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:53,620
<4-16,Sheldon>用鼻子平衡塑料气球
<4-16,Sheldon>Balancing a beach ball on her nose

219
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:56,960
<4-17,Leonard>不行  这一套必须打住
<4-17,Leonard>No, this has to stop now.

220
00:10:57,030 --> 00:11:01,150
<4-18,Sheldon>我不是真的建议让她从水池里跳出来
<4-18,Sheldon>I'm not suggesting we really make her jump out of a pool.

221
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:03,060
<4-18,Sheldon>我以为你该听出了我的"才怪了"
<4-18,Sheldon>I thought the "bazinga" was implied.

222
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:06,230
<4-18,Sheldon>咱们不过是调整她个性
<4-18,Sheldon>We're just tweaking her personality.

223
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,470
<4-18,Sheldon>用另一种说法  就是把那些粗糙表面磨磨光
<4-18,Sheldon>Sanding off the rough edges, if you will.

224
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,690
<4-19,Leonard>不行  你不能磨佩妮
<4-19,Leonard>No. You're not sanding Penny.

225
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:14,140
<4-20,Sheldon>你是说不许我使用
<4-20,Sheldon>Are you saying that I am forbidden

226
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:17,190
<4-20,Sheldon>能让改进我们生活的
<4-20,Sheldon>From applying a harmless, scientifically valid protocol

227
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,850
<4-20,Sheldon>无害的科学有效的正常手段
<4-20,Sheldon>That will make our lives better?

228
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:21,850
<4-21,Leonard>是的  我不许
<4-21,Leonard>Yes. You're forbidden.

229
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,090
<4-22,Sheldon (Squirting him with a water spray)>坏莱纳德
<4-22,Sheldon (Squirting him with a water spray)>Bad Leonard.

230
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:36,840
<5-1,Bethany>那你们俩是做什么的
<5-1,Bethany>So, what do you guys do?

<5-3,Raj>哥特食品喽
<5-3,Raj>Goth food.

234
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:44,880
<5-3,Raj>什么哥特食品
<5-3,Raj>What's goth food?

235
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:48,900
<5-5,Raj>呃  黑焦三文鱼?
<5-5,Raj>Uh. Blackened salmon?

236
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,190
<5-6,Bethany>不是  我是问你们的工作
<5-6,Bethany>No, I meant what do you do for jobs?

237
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,910
<5-7,Raj>我们是科学家
<5-7,Raj>Oh, we're scientists.

238

<5-8,Howard>当然  是黑科学的
<5-8,Howard>Yeah, you know, the dark sciences.

239
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,210
<5-9,Bethany>什么是黑科学
<5-9,Bethany>What are the dark sciences?

240
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,460
<5-9,Bethany>我们
<5-9,Bethany>We...

241
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:02,800

<5-10,Raj>Well, I am an astrophysicist,

242
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:05,050
<5-10,Raj>很多工作都要在晚上进行
<5-10,Raj>And a lot of that takes place at night.

243
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:08,040
<5-10,Raj>那时候也有吸血鬼呀
<5-10,Raj>When there are vampires

244

<5-13,Howard>你肯定知道  那里没人能听到你喊叫
<5-13,Howard>Where, as I'm sure you know, no one can hear you scream.

250
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:31,750
<5-14,Raj>那么  两位女士是做什么的

<7-2,Leonard>她究竟在说什么要这么久
<7-2,Leonard>What could she possibly be talking about for so long?

270
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:35,140
<7-3,Sheldon>显然  在芝士蛋糕厂做招待
<7-3,Sheldon>Obviously, waitressing at the cheesecake factory

271
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:37,730
<7-3,Sheldon>是个复杂的社会经济性活动
<7-3,Sheldon>Is a complex socioeconomic activity

272
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:41,550
<7-3,Sheldon>而且需要相当多的研究与计划

00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:51,080
<7-3,Sheldon>正面鼓励式方法  我能在一个星期之内

278
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:55,680
<7-5,Sheldon>要是你让我用负面鼓励法
<7-5,Sheldon>If you let me use negative reinforcement,

279
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,980
<7-5,Sheldon>睡觉前我就能做到
<7-5,Sheldon>I can get it done before we go to bed.

280
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:01,490
<7-6,Leonard>你不能用水喷她的脸
<7-6,Leonard>You're not squirting her in the face with water.

281
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,820
<7-7,Sheldon>当然不
<7-7,Sheldon>No, of course not.

282
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:04,860
<7-7,Sheldon>我说的是十分轻微的电击法
<7-7,Sheldon>We're talking very mild electric shocks.

<7-7,Sheldon>连组织损伤都不会有
<7-7,Sheldon>No tissue damage whatsoever.

284

<7-8,Leonard>别想了
<7-8,Leonard>Forget it.

285
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:12,210
<7-9,Sheldon>你不可能告诉我
<7-9,Sheldon>Oh, come on. You can't tell me

286
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,630
<7-9,Sheldon>给你打造一个更好的女朋友
<7-9,Sheldon>That you're not intrigued out the possibility

287
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,530
<7-9,Sheldon>让你一点都不动心
<7-9,Sheldon>Of building a better girlfriend.

288
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,940
<7-9,Sheldon>我没有
<7-9,Sheldon>I'm not.

289

<7-10,Leonard>合成了她这个人
<7-10,Leonard>Are what make her who she is.

291
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,730
<7-11,Sheldon>你是说  比如那个让人无法忍受的尖笑声
<7-11,Sheldon>You mean, like that high-pitched, irritating laugh?

292
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,190
<7-12,Leonard>你就不想希望一个低嗓门的笑声吗
<7-12,Leonard>You wouldn't prefer a throaty chuckle?

293
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,920
<7-13,Leonard>不许你改变佩妮的笑声
<7-13,Leonard>You're not changing how Penny laughs.

294
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:38,960
<7-14,Sheldon>那才是荒诞呢
<7-14,Sheldon>No, that would be incongruous.

295
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,460
<7-14,Sheldon>我打算把她的声音整体降低
<7-14,Sheldon>I was going to lower the whole voice

296
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:42,840
<7-14,Sheldon>到一个令人愉快的音区
<7-14,Sheldon>To a more pleasing register.

306
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:18,330
<8-1,Raj>就为了有可能吊上一个
<8-1,Raj>Just for the possibility you could have cheap sex

307
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,210
<8-1,Raj>在酒吧里遇到的马子?

<8-21,Bethany>小事一桩而已  你又不是没纹过
<8-21,Bethany>What's the big deal? You've done this before.

<8-22,Howard>He's a fraud.

335
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,690
<8-23,Raj>我们都说谎了
<8-23,Raj>We're both frauds.

336
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:34,810
<8-24,Howard>我不是已经说过了吗
<8-24,Howard>Yeah, I think I covered that.

337
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:37,090
<8-25,Raj>我是在总结
<8-25,Raj>But I was summing up.

338
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:42,750
<8-26,Howard>我们不是哥特  我们只是普通人
<8-26,Howard>We're not Goth. We're just...guys.

00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:44,700
<8-27,Raj>非常  非常聪明的人
<8-27,Raj>Very, very smart guys.

340
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,650
<8-28,Bethany>那你们一直在骗人
<8-28,Bethany>So you were totally scamming us?

341
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,320
<8-28,Bethany>是的
<8-28,Bethany>Yes.

342
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:50,920
<8-29,Howard>要是你想离开再也不想见到我们
<8-29,Howard>And I wouldn't blame you if you

343
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:54,340
<8-29,Howard>我也不会怪你
<8-29,Howard>Walked out of here and never wanted to see us again.

344
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,900
<8-29,Howard>除非  这突如其来的坦率
<8-29,Howard>Unless, of course,our bold honesty

345
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,870
<8-29,Howard>给我们增添了无限魅力
<8-29,Howard>Has suddenly made us attractive

346
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,240
<8-29,Howard>怎么样

<8-31,Sarah>我也要走了  反正也没人关心
<8-31,Sarah>I'm leaving, too. Not that anyone cares.

349
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:22,030
<8-32,Raj>等回去说起此事时  要编个不一样的结局
<8-32,Raj>When we tell this story, let's end it differently.

350
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:25,150
<8-33,Howard>你在想什么  是不是还要来一段歌舞
<8-33,Howard>What are you thinking? Maybe a big musical number?

351
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:34,570
<9-1,Sheldon>我弄点热牛奶就进去睡了
<9-1,Sheldon>Well, I'm going to make some warm milk and then turn in.

352
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,740
<9-1,Sheldon>我相信如果你们打算
<9-1,Sheldon>I trust if you two are planning on engaging

353
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,330
<9-1,Sheldon>亲热的话
<9-1,Sheldon>In amorous activities,

354
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,380
<9-1,Sheldon>会尽量小声点的
<9-1,Sheldon>You'll keep the decibel level to a minimum.

355
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:42,400
<9-2,Penny>当然

358
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,560
<9-5,Leonard>难以置信
<9-5,Leonard>Unbelievable.

359
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:53,560
<9-6,Penny>怎么了
<9-6,Penny>What?

360
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:54,710
<9-7,Leonard>我刚在想
<9-7,Leonard>I-I was just thinking

361
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,580
<9-7,Leonard>我们也该进房睡了
<9-7,Leonard>We should probably turn in, too.

362
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:59,460
<9-8,Penny>我的新床送来了
<9-8,Penny>Well, you know, my new bed got delivered. If you come over

363
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:01,750
<9-8,Penny>如果你过来把它组装好  就能睡在我那里了
<9-8,Penny>And put it together, you can stay at my place.

364
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:04,130
<9-9,Leonard>是吗  但得花不少时间  而且现在有点晚了
<9-9,Leonard>Really? That's a lot of work, and it's kind of late.

365
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,250
<9-10,Penny>但那样我们就不用小声了
<9-10,Penny>Yeah, but if we stay there, we won't have tbe quiet.

366
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,440
<9-11,Leonard>我们走
<9-11,Leonard>Let's go.

367
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:12,310
<9-12,Sheldon>有趣
<9-12,Sheldon>Interesting.

368
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:16,610
<9-12,Sheldon>在修正行为方面  性爱比巧克力更有效
<9-12,Sheldon>Sex works even better than chocolate to modify behavior.

369
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,770
<9-12,Sheldon>不知道有没有人研究过这点
<9-12,Sheldon>I wonder if anyone else has stumbled onto that.

370
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,390
<10-1,Howard>等等  这个故事怎么样
<10-1,Howard>Okay, wait. How about this?

371
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:34,590
<10-1,Howard>有四个哥特女孩
<10-1,Howard>We say there were four goth girls.

372
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:37,510
<10-1,Howard>酒吧里有两个女孩  她们还有两个朋友
<10-1,Howard>The two girls in the club have two friends.

373
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:38,930
<10-2,Raj>不错  不错
<10-2,Raj>I like it, I like it.

374
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:42,050
<10-2,Raj>虽然她们是哥特  但她们的味道香吗
<10-2,Raj>Did they smell good despite their goth-like nature?

375
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,980
<10-3,Howard>这有什么关系
<10-3,Howard>What's that got to do with the story?

376
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:46,720
<10-4,Raj>加上嗅觉的描述  我觉得比较真实
<10-4,Raj>Engaging my olfactory sense helps make it real for me.

377
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:48,720
<10-5,Howard>好吧  她们闻起来香香的
<10-5,Howard>Fine, they smelled good

378
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:52,220
<10-6,Raj>确实  就像茉莉和金银花
<10-6,Raj>Oh, they did. Like jasmine and honeysuckle

379
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,110
<10-7,Howard>无所谓
<10-7,Howard>Whatever.

380
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:55,740
<10-8,Raj>她们手拉手  对我们疯狂的
<10-8,Raj>And then they held hands and did a sexy, demonic

381
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:57,580
<10-8,Raj>做下流动作
<10-8,Raj>Hokey pokey for us.

382
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,420
<10-9,Howard>不不  先让我把故事说完
<10-9,Howard>No, no. Ok, let me just say my story all the way through

383
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,870
<10-9,Howard>你再说你的  然后我们再选
<10-9,Howard>And then you can say yours, and then we'll pick.

384
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,170
<10-10,Raj>抱歉  你继续说
<10-10,Raj>I'm sorry. Go on.

385
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,620
<10-11,Howard>我们去纹了身
<10-11,Howard>Okay. We got tattoos,

386
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:08,260
<10-11,Howard>-然后四个女孩带我们到她们的住所  -但我们没有纹身
<10-11,Howard>- And then the four girls took us to their place - But we don't have tattoos.E.

387
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,620
<10-12,Raj>万一有人要看纹身  怎么办
<10-12,Raj>What if someone asks to see our tattoos?

388
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:13,240
<10-13,Howard>我们就说纹在了非常私密的部位
<10-13,Howard>We say they're in a very intimate area.

389
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,760
<10-14,Raj>我们太坏了  不是吗
<10-14,Raj>Oh, we're bad boys, aren't we?

390
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:18,850
<10-15,Howard>就是  就是
<10-15,Howard>Right, right.

391
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,140
<10-15,Howard>再回头说她们的住所
<10-15,Howard>So, we go back to their place

392
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,770
<10-15,Howard>最后我们六个人倒在热气腾腾的浴缸中
<10-15,Howard>And then the six of us end up in a hot tub.

393
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,190
<10-16,Raj>但我们刚纹了身
<10-16,Raj>But we just got tattos.

394
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:27,140
<10-16,Raj>我们不怕细菌感染吗
<10-16,Raj>Wouldn't we be concerned about bacterial infection?

395
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:29,760
<10-17,Howard>对  那不要浴缸这段了
<10-17,Howard>True. Okay. Forget the hot tub.

396
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:34,980
<10-17,Howard>重点是我们都和火辣的哥特女孩亲热
<10-17,Howard>The point is, we each had a ménage with sexy goth girls.

397
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:40,290
<10-18,Raj>今晚太棒了
<10-18,Raj>What a great night.

398
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:42,370
<10-18,Raj>是啊
<10-18,Raj>Yeah.

399
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:50,330
<10-19,Howard>明晚去乡村酒吧碰运气吗
<10-19,Howard>Hey, want to try a country bar tomorrow night?

400
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,950
<10-20,Raj>也许我们能钓上几个牛仔女孩
<10-20,Raj>Maybe we'll get lucky with some sexy cowgirls.

401
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,950
<10-21,Howard>很有可能
<10-21,Howard>Could happen.

402
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:00,280
<10-22,Raj>不知道她们闻起来什么味道
<10-22,Raj>I wonder how they smell.
