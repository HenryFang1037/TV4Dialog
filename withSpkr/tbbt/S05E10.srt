1
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,130
<1-1,Howard>说来真奇怪  人们总是来漫画书店买书
<1-1,Howard>It's amazing people keep coming to comic book stores

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,200
<1-1,Howard>而不是直接从网上下载电子版的
<1-1,Howard>instead of just downloading comics digitally.

3
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,140
<1-2,Leonard>这样可能更好
<1-2,Leonard>It's probably for the best.

4
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:14,210
<1-2,Leonard>对于很多宅男来说  这里是每周出门的唯一理由
<1-2,Leonard>For a lot of these guys, the weekly trip here

5
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:16,280
<1-2,Leonard>他们妈妈也好抓紧自己儿子唯一挪窝的时间
<1-2,Leonard>is the only chance their mom has to go down

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,110
<1-2,Leonard>冲进房间换上干净的床单
<1-2,Leonard>to the basement and change their sheets.

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,320
<1-3,Howard>这倒提醒我  我今晚有干净的新床单睡了
<1-3,Howard>Oh, that reminds me, I get fresh sheets tonight. Yay.

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,920
<1-3,Howard>怎么样
<1-3,Howard>Well?

9
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,820
<1-4,Sheldon>感觉新漫画书之夜如何
<1-4,Sheldon>What do you think of New Comic Book Night?

10
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,320
<1-4,Sheldon>很神奇吧
<1-4,Sheldon>Magic, huh?

11
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:33,230
<1-5,Amy>谢尔顿  我其实很失望
<1-5,Amy>Sheldon, I'm disappointed.

12
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:34,430
<1-5,Amy>作为一个天才
<1-5,Amy>As a brilliant man,

13
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:35,600
<1-5,Amy>你也算数一数二的人物
<1-5,Amy>you're entitled to a vice.

14
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,300
<1-5,Amy>我能理解你经常逛鸦片窑
<1-5,Amy>I could understand frequenting an opium den

15
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,430
<1-5,Amy>或是为了好玩去猎杀你的同伴
<1-5,Amy>or hunting your fellow man for sport.

16
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:44,000
<1-5,Amy>但是看漫画  逊咖
<1-5,Amy>But this? Lame-o.

17
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:48,610
<1-6,Sheldon>首先  漫画书通过连环画来讲述故事
<1-6,Sheldon>Well, A) Comic books employ storytelling through sequential art,

18
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:50,740
<1-6,Sheldon>这种方式可追溯到一万七千年前
<1-6,Sheldon>an medium that dates back 17,000 years

19
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,610
<1-6,Sheldon>拉斯科洞穴壁画时代
<1-6,Sheldon>to the cave paintings of Lascaux,

20
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:54,950
<1-6,Sheldon>其次  你还玩竖琴呢
<1-6,Sheldon>and B) You play the harp.

21
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,550
<1-6,Sheldon>你以为那很酷吗
<1-6,Sheldon>Like that's cool.

22
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,020
<1-7,Stuart>要我帮你找漫画吗
<1-7,Stuart>Can I help you find anything?

23
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,120
<1-8,Amy>有没有描述一个女人的乳房
<1-8,Amy>A comic that depicts a woman whose bosom

24
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:06,190
<1-8,Amy>不能用来当救生装置的漫画
<1-8,Amy>can't be used as a flotation device.

25
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:08,660
<1-9,Stuart>抱歉  来这里的男生
<1-9,Stuart>Sorry. Most of the guys

26
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:10,900
<1-9,Stuart>大部分都喜欢大咪咪
<1-9,Stuart>who come in here like big boobs.

27
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:13,070
<1-9,Stuart>有几个自己的咪咪也挺大的
<1-9,Stuart>Couple of them have big boobs.

28
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,900
<1-10,Raj>"卡亚战神"出了新的扩展包
<1-10,Raj>The new Warlords of Ka'a expansion pack is out.

29
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:20,040
<1-11,Howard>又出新的  有没有搞错
<1-11,Howard>A new one? Unbelievable.

30
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,340
<1-11,Howard>这帮人老是瞎掰一些新的怪物
<1-11,Howard>They just keep making up more cheesy monsters,

31
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:25,780
<1-11,Howard>把它们印到卡上  一包卖25块钱
<1-11,Howard>slapping them on cards and selling them at 25 bucks a pop.

32
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:29,320
<1-11,Howard>这是在暗中让没女人的宅男多掏一份税钱
<1-11,Howard>It's like a secret tax on guys who can't get laid.

33
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:31,490
<1-12,Raj>他们真是太不给力了
<1-12,Raj>They're not even trying.

34
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:33,620
<1-12,Raj>还记得那个有"地狱大象"的"邪恶撒旦"包吗
<1-12,Raj>Remember the Satanimals pack with the Hellephant?

35
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:34,990
<1-12,Raj>太扯淡了
<1-12,Raj>Why, absurd.

36
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:37,460
<1-12,Raj>他算个啥  死了以后下地狱的邪恶大象吗
<1-12,Raj>What was he, a bad elephant who died and went to hell?

37
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,860
<1-12,Raj>一头大象能干出啥坏事
<1-12,Raj>What could an elephant possibly do

38
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:42,200
<1-12,Raj>死了以后还要被打下地狱
<1-12,Raj>that would cause him eternal damnation?

39
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,830
<1-12,Raj>"狂野西部女巫"
<1-12,Raj>"Wild West and Witches"?

40
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:47,030
<1-13,Howard>有哪个白痴会关心
<1-13,Howard>What kind of loser cares about a showdown

41
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,900
<1-13,Howard>比利小子和北方白袍巫师的决战
<1-13,Howard>between Billy the Kid and the White Wizard of the North?

42
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,440
<1-14,Raj>只有窝囊废才关心
<1-14,Raj>A total loser.

43
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,470
<1-14,Raj>不就是一个手持六发左轮手枪的小子
<1-14,Raj>Obviously, a guy with a six-shooter

44
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,340
<1-14,Raj>打败了一个手持魔杖的老人嘛
<1-14,Raj>beats an old man with a magic wand.

45
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,610
<1-15,Leonard>等等
<1-15,Leonard>Well, h-hold on.

46
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,580
<1-15,Leonard>要是那个巫师
<1-15,Leonard>Uh, what if the wizard casts

47
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,790
<1-15,Leonard>在比利小子的牛仔帽上下了困惑头盔咒呢
<1-15,Leonard>a Helmet of Confusion spell on Billy the Kid's cowboy hat?

48
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,250
<1-16,Howard>什么  拜托
<1-16,Howard>What? Please!

49
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,090
<1-16,Howard>我们说的可是比利小子
<1-16,Howard>This is Billy the Kid we're talking about.

50
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,960
<1-16,Howard>巫师还没来得及说话呢
<1-16,Howard>I mean, the wizard would get shot between the eyes

51
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,190
<1-16,Howard>就已经被爆头了
<1-16,Howard>before he could ever get out the words,

52
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,330
<1-16,Howard>比利小子究竟去
<1-16,Howard>"What the hell is Billy the Kid doing

53
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:16,100
<1-16,Howard>卡亚秘境干嘛
<1-16,Howard>in the mystic realm of Ka'a?"

54
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,400
<1-16,Howard>莱纳德
<1-16,Howard>Leonard...

55
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,400
<1-17,Stuart>谢尔顿和他朋友艾米是啥关系
<1-17,Stuart>What's the deal with Sheldon's friend Amy?

56
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,570
<1-17,Stuart>他们是一对吗
<1-17,Stuart>Are they a couple?

57
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:24,940
<1-18,Leonard>一对怪人倒是真的  怎么了
<1-18,Leonard>Couple of weirdos. Why?

58
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,840
<1-19,Howard>你对艾米感兴趣吗
<1-19,Howard>You interested in Amy?

59
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,510
<1-20,Stuart>我只是觉得她看我的时候
<1-20,Stuart>Well, I mean, she didn't look through me

60
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:31,310
<1-20,Stuart>不会觉得我灵魂恶心  胆小如鼠
<1-20,Stuart>with soul-sucking, ball-shriveling

61
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,880
<1-20,Stuart>也不会一脸厌恶和鄙夷
<1-20,Stuart>hatred and contempt.

62
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,820
<1-20,Stuart>我喜欢这种女人
<1-20,Stuart>I like that in a woman.

63
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,490
<1-20,Stuart>能否帮我问问谢尔顿  我能不能约她出去玩
<1-20,Stuart>Could you run it by Sheldon if I could ask her out?

64
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:40,820
<1-21,Leonard>当然可以
<1-21,Leonard>Sure. I guess.

65
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,220
<1-22,Raj>斯图尔特  帮我们解决下争议
<1-22,Raj>Stuart, settle an argument for us.

66
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,290
<1-22,Raj>谁会赢
<1-22,Raj>Who would win,

67
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:46,630
<1-22,Raj>比利小子还是白袍巫师
<1-22,Raj>Billy the Kid or the White Wizard?

68
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:48,600
<1-23,Stuart>我要是告诉你们
<1-23,Stuart>If I tell you that,

69
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,800
<1-23,Stuart>我就剥夺了你们玩这个游戏的快乐
<1-23,Stuart>I'm robbing you of the hours of fun you could have

70
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:57,100
<1-23,Stuart>现在超低价  只卖24块9毛5哦
<1-23,Stuart>for the magical, rootin'-tootin' low price of $24.95.

71
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:59,240
<1-24,Raj>我要一个
<1-24,Raj>I'll take one.

72
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,770
<1-25,Howard>那  要两个吧
<1-25,Howard>Mm... make it two.

73
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,480
<1-26,Leonard>我恨你们和我自己  要三个
<1-26,Leonard>I hate all of you and myself. Three.

74
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,650
<1-27,Stuart>我去下单
<1-27,Stuart>I'll ring it up.

75
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:09,550
<1-27,Stuart>瓮中捉鳖  易如反掌
<1-27,Stuart>Like shooting nerds in a barrel.

85
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:37,620
<2-1,Leonard>我能跟你谈件事吗
<2-1,Leonard>Hey, can I talk to you about something?

86
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,190
<2-1,Leonard>有点难开口
<2-1,Leonard>It's a little awkward.

87
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:42,420
<2-2,Sheldon>我知道你要说什么
<2-2,Sheldon>I know what this is about.

88
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,220
<2-2,Sheldon>鉴于你事业上的停滞不前
<2-2,Sheldon>Given the professional standstill you're at,

89
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:47,660
<2-2,Sheldon>你现在肯定想知道是否应该
<2-2,Sheldon>you're wondering if this is the appropriate time

90
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:51,230
<2-2,Sheldon>放弃科研  专攻教育事业
<2-2,Sheldon>to abandon your research and focus on teaching.

91
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:56,900
<2-2,Sheldon>应该
<2-2,Sheldon>Yes.

92
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,540
<2-2,Sheldon>而且我建议你
<2-2,Sheldon>And if I may suggest,

93
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,140
<2-2,Sheldon>考虑教别的学科
<2-2,Sheldon>consider changing disciplines.

94
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,410
<2-2,Sheldon>比如人文学科  就像历史
<2-2,Sheldon>Yeah, to the humanities-- perhaps history.

95
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,840
<2-2,Sheldon>教历史的一个好处在于
<2-2,Sheldon>One of the advantages of teaching history

96
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:08,550
<2-2,Sheldon>你不用搞创造发明
<2-2,Sheldon>is that you don't have to create things.

97
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:11,580
<2-2,Sheldon>你只要记住历史上发生过的事
<2-2,Sheldon>You know, you just have to remember stuff that happened

98
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,490
<2-2,Sheldon>然后鹦鹉学舌般复述就行
<2-2,Sheldon>and then parrot it back.

99
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:15,690
<2-2,Sheldon>你会觉得很开心的
<2-2,Sheldon>You could have fun with that.

100
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,660
<2-3,Leonard>我要说的不是这个
<2-3,Leonard>Yeah, that's not it.

101
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,090
<2-3,Leonard>斯图尔特对艾米感兴趣
<2-3,Leonard>Stuart's kind of interested in Amy.

102
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,500
<2-4,Sheldon>这当然啦  她是非常有趣的人
<2-4,Sheldon>Oh, of course he is. She's very interesting.

103
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,630
<2-4,Sheldon>你知道吗  她14岁的时候
<2-4,Sheldon>Did you know, when she was 14,

104
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:28,730
<2-4,Sheldon>自己把脚趾间连着的皮割开了
<2-4,Sheldon>she severed the webbing between her own toes?

105
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,340
<2-4,Sheldon>不是这个意思
<2-4,Sheldon>No.

106
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,540
<2-5,Leonard>他叫我问问
<2-5,Leonard>He wanted me to find out

107
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,740
<2-5,Leonard>你介不介意他约艾米出去玩
<2-5,Leonard>if you'd have a problem with him asking her out.

108
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:42,510
<2-6,Sheldon>我不确定该怎么回答  莱纳德
<2-6,Sheldon>I'm not sure how to respond, Leonard.

109
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,980
<2-6,Sheldon>艾米又不是我的人
<2-6,Sheldon>I don't own Amy.

110
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:47,620
<2-6,Sheldon>我也不能拥有某个人
<2-6,Sheldon>Can't own a person.

111
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,360
<2-6,Sheldon>至少从什么时候开始不能呢
<2-6,Sheldon>At least not since...

112
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,660
<2-6,Sheldon>1863年
<2-6,Sheldon>1863.

113
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:00,870
<2-6,Sheldon>因为林肯总统解放了什么呢
<2-6,Sheldon>President Lincoln freed the...

114
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,840
<2-6,Sheldon>黑奴  拜托  莱纳德
<2-6,Sheldon>Slaves! Come on, Leonard,

115
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,710
<2-6,Sheldon>如果你要去教历史
<2-6,Sheldon>if you're going to teach history,

116
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:08,140
<2-6,Sheldon>你就该知道这些历史事件
<2-6,Sheldon>these are the kind of facts you'll have to know.

117
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,110
<2-7,Leonard>好吧  当我没说
<2-7,Leonard>You know what? Never mind.

118
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,240
<2-7,Leonard>我就让他放心大胆地去约艾米吧
<2-7,Leonard>I'm going to tell him it's okay to ask her out.

119
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,550
<2-8,Sheldon>这问题毫无意义
<2-8,Sheldon>The question is moot.

120
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,410
<2-8,Sheldon>斯图尔特这么一个
<2-8,Sheldon>There is no way that Stuart,

121
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,580
<2-8,Sheldon>穷不啦叽的漫画店老板
<2-8,Sheldon>an impoverished peddler of picture books,

122
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:20,250
<2-8,Sheldon>对艾米·菲拉·福勒毫无吸引力可言
<2-8,Sheldon>would be at all appealing to Amy Farrah Fowler,

123
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,360
<2-8,Sheldon>她可是著名神经生理学家
<2-8,Sheldon>a noted neurobiologist

125
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,090
<2-8,Sheldon>只用罐子里的鲜奶油做出的
<2-8,Sheldon>capable of performing surgery on her own feet

126
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:27,330
<2-8,Sheldon>一氧化二氮当麻醉剂
<2-8,Sheldon>with nothing but nitrous oxide

127
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:29,960
<2-8,Sheldon>就能给自己的脚动手术
<2-8,Sheldon>from cans of whipped cream as anesthesia.

128
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,100
<2-9,Leonard>好吧  不过强调一下
<2-9,Leonard>All right, but for the record,

129
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:36,000
<2-9,Leonard>我可是特意征询过你对此事的感受

<7-17,Penny>好吧  亲爱的  我给你讲个故事吧
<7-17,Penny>All right, honey, let me tell you a story.

<7-17,Penny>我喜欢过一个男人  但从未对他表白过

<7-21,Penny>你确定吗
<7-21,Penny>Are you sure?

321
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,480
<7-22,Sheldon>这就解释了一切
<7-22,Sheldon>That would explain so much.

<7-22,Sheldon>你总是赖在我家不走

347
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:23,360
