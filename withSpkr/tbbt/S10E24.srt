20
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,460
<1-1,Sheldon>还适应吗
<1-1,Sheldon>How are you settling in?

21
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:47,640
<1-2,Amy>挺好的
<1-2,Amy>Pretty well.

22
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,800
<1-2,Amy>普林斯顿的校区很棒
<1-2,Amy>Princeton has a beautiful campus.

23
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,870
<1-3,Sheldon>我学了几个新泽西的有趣小知识
<1-3,Sheldon>Now, I've learned some fun facts about New Jersey

24
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,520
<1-3,Sheldon>你能拿去跟别人打开话题
<1-3,Sheldon>to help you make small talk.

25
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,280
<1-3,Sheldon>你想知道他们的州鸟或谋杀率吗
<1-3,Sheldon>Would you like to know the state bird or the murder rate?

26
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,500
<1-3,Sheldon>说出来都会吓你一跳
<1-3,Sheldon>They're both shocking.

27
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:03,720
<1-4,Amy>其实我想听的是你的事
<1-4,Amy>Actually, I want to hear about you.

28
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,120
<1-4,Amy>你那边还好吗
<1-4,Amy>How are things at home?

29
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,180
<1-5,Sheldon>我这边看到东部金翅雀
<1-5,Sheldon>Well, I'm a lot less likely to see an Eastern Goldfinch

30
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:11,300
<1-5,Sheldon>或者被谋杀的几率肯定比你低
<1-5,Sheldon>or be murdered, I'll tell you that.

31
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:12,840
<1-6,Amy>我想你
<1-6,Amy>I miss you.

32
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,400
<1-7,Sheldon>我也想你
<1-7,Sheldon>I miss you, too.

33
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,290
<1-8,Amy>有件事很奇怪
<1-8,Amy>It's so strange,

34
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:17,800
<1-8,Amy>今天早先我用介词结尾了一个句子
<1-8,Amy>earlier today I ended a sentence with a preposition

35
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,800
<1-8,Amy>而你却不在我身边纠正我语法
<1-8,Amy>and you weren't there to correct my grammar.

36
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,070
<1-9,Sheldon>我对你这遭遇感到抱歉
<1-9,Sheldon>I'm sorry you had to go through that.

37
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:26,190
<1-10,Amy>其实呢
<1-10,Amy>In fact,

38
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:29,520
<1-10,Amy>我正是因为这事而开始想念你
<1-10,Amy>that's when I started to really miss you.

39
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,890
<1-11,Sheldon>你刚才分裂了不定式
<1-11,Sheldon>You know you just split an infinitive.

40
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,030
<1-12,Amy>是吗
<1-12,Amy>Did I?

41
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,960
<1-12,Amy>你要好好教育我吗
<1-12,Amy>Are you gonna teach me a lesson?

42
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,940
<1-13,Sheldon>当然要
<1-13,Sheldon>I am.

43
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:45,200
<1-13,Sheldon>你这样很不乖
<1-13,Sheldon>It is naughty to put an adverb

44
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,860
<1-13,Sheldon>在"to"跟动词之间插入副词
<1-13,Sheldon>between the word "to" and the verb stem.

45
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:51,320
<1-14,Amy>那你要怎么惩罚我啊
<1-14,Amy>What are you gonna do about it?

46
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:54,680
<1-15,Sheldon>我要告诫你
<1-15,Sheldon>I'm going to admonish you.

47
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,890
<1-16,Amy>狠狠地告诫吗
<1-16,Amy>Vigorously?

48
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:01,430
<1-17,Sheldon>我也只会这么告诫人
<1-17,Sheldon>That's the only kind of admonishing I do.

59
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:29,210
<2-1,Howard>艾米走后  谢尔顿还好吗
<2-1,Howard>How's Sheldon doing with Amy gone?

60
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:30,430
<2-2,Leonard>最近三个晚上
<2-2,Leonard>Well, the last three nights

61
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:32,270
<2-2,Leonard>我带他去剪了头发
<2-2,Leonard>I've had to take him to get a haircut,

62
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:35,050
<2-2,Leonard>去火车模型店  去了隔壁市还有在卖
<2-2,Leonard>to the train store, and to a Walgreens in Arcadia

63
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:38,760
<2-2,Leonard>"好版本布洛芬止痛药"的连锁药店
<2-2,Leonard>where they still have the "Good ibuprofen."

64
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,620
<2-2,Leonard>现在问问我  艾米走后  我还好吗
<2-2,Leonard>Now ask me how I'm doing with Amy gone.

65
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,810
<2-3,Raj>-艾米走后你还...  -闭嘴
<2-3,Raj>- How are you doing with... - Shut up.

<2-5,Howard>If you'd like, we can help you out.

67
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,730

<2-6,Leonard>Oh, that would be great.

68
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:50,300
<2-7,Howard>不是我帮你  我是有老婆孩子的忙人了
<2-7,Howard>I mean, not me, I've got a wife and child,

69
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:54,420
<2-7,Howard>但这家伙闲到在社交媒体上发牙线洁牙的视频
<2-7,Howard>but this one posts video of himself flossing on Instagram.

<2-9,Leonard>太好了  今晚他想去家居店看看梯子
<2-9,Leonard>Great. Tonight he wants to look at ladders at Home Depot.

73
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,840
<2-10,Raj>他为什么会需要梯子
<2-10,Raj>Oh, why does he need a ladder?

74
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,290
<2-11,Leonard>他不需要  他就是喜欢看看
<2-11,Leonard>He doesn't; he just likes looking at them.

75
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:08,730
<2-11,Leonard>记得带本书打发时间
<2-11,Leonard>Bring a book.

<2-16,Sheldon>诺维茨基博士要跟我说说
<2-16,Sheldon>Dr. Nowitzki's going to tell me

83
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,380
<2-16,Sheldon>她在欧洲核子研究中心的研究
<2-16,Sheldon>about the work she did at CERN.

84
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:24,320
<2-16,Sheldon>而且她还给我带了免税三角巧克力
<2-16,Sheldon>And she brought me this duty-free Toblerone.

85
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,180
<2-17,Leonard>我好爱吃这个
<2-17,Leonard>Oh. I love those.

86
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,550
<2-18,Sheldon>我们坐别桌吧
<2-18,Sheldon>Let's sit somewhere else.

87
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:34,900
<2-19,Raj>刚发生什么事了
<2-19,Raj>What just happened?

88
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:40,290
<2-20,Howard>一个陌生人用巧克力棒诱拐走了谢尔顿
<2-20,Howard>A stranger just lured Sheldon away with a candy bar.

89
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,980
<2-21,Leonard>等等  她不是以前一直围着他转的女研究生吗
<2-21,Leonard>Wait, isn't she the grad student that used to follow him around?

91
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,220
<2-22,Howard>是呢
<2-22,Howard>Oh, yeah.

92
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:49,060
<2-22,Howard>在他还没进入青春期  鸡鸡没发育的时候
<2-22,Howard>Back before he hit puberty and grew man parts.

93
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,630
<2-23,Raj>你们觉得他们有什么猫腻
<2-23,Raj>So what do you guys think that's about?

94
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,200
<2-24,Leonard>据我对谢尔顿的了解  啥都没有
<2-24,Leonard>Knowing Sheldon, nothing.

95
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,440
<2-25,Sheldon>跟我说说你的标量场暗能量实验
<2-25,Sheldon>So, tell me about your scalar dark energy experiment.

96
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,930
<2-26,Ramona>你先跟我说说你最新的论文
<2-26,Ramona>Not 'til you tell me about your latest paper

97
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,630
<2-26,Ramona>圈量子理论
<2-26,Ramona>on quantum loop theory.

98
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,440
<2-27,Sheldon>你肯定是那种要先吃甜点才吃正餐的人
<2-27,Sheldon>You must be one of those dessert before dinner people.

99
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:07,800
<2-28,Leonard>他居然引她发笑了  果真是有猫腻
<2-28,Leonard>He just made her laugh, something's wrong.

100
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:11,480
<2-29,Raj>你们看到她看他的眼神了吗
<2-29,Raj>Do you see the way she's looking at him?

101
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,390
<2-30,Howard>看到了  就像当年伯纳黛特看我那样
<2-30,Howard>Yeah. Like Bernadette used to look at me.

102
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:18,100
<2-31,Raj>我跟你说过多少次了  关上浴室门
<2-31,Raj>I keep telling you, close the bathroom door.

103
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,260
<2-32,Leonard>你们看到了吗
<2-32,Leonard>Ah, did you see that?

104
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,440
<2-32,Leonard>她摸了他的手  他都没甩开
<2-32,Leonard>She just touched his hand and he didn't swat it away.

105
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,570
<2-32,Leonard>到底怎么回事
<2-32,Leonard>What is happening?

106
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:29,620
<2-33,Howard>最简单的解释通常也是最正确的解释
<2-33,Howard>Okay, the simplest explanation is usually the right one.

107
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:30,990
<2-34,Raj>什么解释
<2-34,Raj>Which is?

108
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:33,560
<2-35,Howard>那不是谢尔顿
<2-35,Howard>That ain't Sheldon.

109
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,890
<3-1,Penny>他们不止共进午餐
<3-1,Penny>Not only did they eat together,

110
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:40,000
<3-1,Penny>莱纳德说谢尔顿还把她逗乐了
<3-1,Penny>Leonard said he made her laugh.

111
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,920
<3-1,Penny>那不算什么
<3-1,Penny>That's nothing,

112
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,470
<3-2,Bernadette>华仔说她还碰了谢尔顿的手
<3-2,Bernadette>Howie said she touched his hand.

113
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,240
<3-3,Penny>他用洗手液清洁了吗
<3-3,Penny>Did he Purell?

114
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,510
<3-4,Bernadette>并没有
<3-4,Bernadette>No.

115
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,180
<3-5,Penny>真不敢相信莱纳德提了三角巧克力
<3-5,Penny>I cannot believe Leonard mentioned the Toblerone

116
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,500
<3-5,Penny>却没提到这个
<3-5,Penny>but left that part out.

117
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,400
<3-6,Bernadette>我们该打给艾米吗
<3-6,Bernadette>Should we call Amy?

118
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,380
<3-7,Penny>不知道  如果没什么的话我们不该让她担心
<3-7,Penny>I don't know; we shouldn't worry her if it's nothing.

119
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,240
<3-8,Bernadette>那我们再等等
<3-8,Bernadette>I guess we could wait

120
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,280
<3-8,Bernadette>-等掌握多一点这妹子的情况再说  -行
<3-8,Bernadette>- till we have more information about this girl. - Yeah.

121
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,060
<3-9,Penny>你觉得跟艾米住在一起
<3-9,Penny>Do you think living with Amy

122
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,640
<3-9,Penny>会不会莫名其妙激起谢尔顿的...
<3-9,Penny>has somehow stirred up Sheldon's...

123
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,550
<3-9,Penny>性欲
<3-9,Penny>sexual appetite?

124
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:17,640
<3-10,Bernadette>你怎么能有那种想法
<3-10,Bernadette>How can you think that?

125
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:21,360
<3-10,Bernadette>这么恶心的句子你居然也说得出来
<3-10,Bernadette>Why would you even put those words together?

126
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,250
<3-11,Penny>好啦  那我们达成共识
<3-11,Penny>All right, then we agree.

127
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,350
<3-11,Penny>他不会采取任何行动
<3-11,Penny>He's not making any moves,

128
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:25,740
<3-11,Penny>是那个博士妞拉蒙娜太主动
<3-11,Penny>it's this Dr. Ramona chick.

129
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,640
<3-12,Bernadette>诺维茨基  我上网查了她  人还挺俏
<3-12,Bernadette>Nowitzki. I Googled her, she's pretty cute.

130
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,230
<3-13,Penny>是吗  莱纳德只告诉我
<3-13,Penny>Really? All I got from Leonard

133
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,910
<4-1,Sheldon>我看见一把折叠关节梯
<4-1,Sheldon>I saw an articulating ladder

134
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:41,810
<4-1,Sheldon>带双腿水平校准  可以在不平坦的地面
<4-1,Sheldon>with dual-leg leveling, which delivers stability

135
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:45,160
<4-1,Sheldon>提供稳定性和适应性
<4-1,Sheldon>and adaptability to uneven terrain.

136
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,520
<4-2,Amy>听起来今晚过得很充实啊
<4-2,Amy>Sounds like a big night.

137
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,080
<4-3,Sheldon>对啊  拉杰还讲了一个超好笑的笑话
<4-3,Sheldon>Yeah. Raj made the funniest joke, he said,

138
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,170
<4-3,Sheldon>他说"哪一把梯子最适合拿来自杀上吊"
<4-3,Sheldon>"Which is the best ladder to use to hang myself?"

139
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,480
<4-4,Amy>所以你一直都有事情做  你不会孤单吗
<4-4,Amy>So you're keeping busy? You're not lonely?

149
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,850
<4-9,Sheldon>她一直对我的研究超级感兴趣
<4-9,Sheldon>She's always been a huge fan of my work,

150
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:19,480
<4-9,Sheldon>现在她在加州理工学院做研究
<4-9,Sheldon>and now she's doing research at Caltech.

151
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,170
<4-10,Amy>超级迷妹  是吧
<4-10,Amy>Huge fan, you say?

152
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,260
<4-11,Sheldon>是的  我觉得你会喜欢她
<4-11,Sheldon>Yes. I think you'd like her.

153
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:27,270
<4-11,Sheldon>她冰雪聪明  就跟你一样
<4-11,Sheldon>She's extremely intelligent, just like you.

154
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,500
<4-11,Sheldon>跟你不一样的是  她是金发高妹
<4-11,Sheldon>Unlike you, she's tall, blonde

155
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,970
<4-11,Sheldon>之前还是奥运会的游泳选手
<4-11,Sheldon>and used to be an Olympic swimmer.

156
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,970
<4-12,Amy>太棒了  我很快打回来给你
<4-12,Amy>That's terrific. I'll call you right back.

157
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,540
<5-1,Penny (answering skype)>艾米
<5-1,Penny (answering skype)>Oh, hey, Amy.

158
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:44,450
<5-2,Amy>我就让你们做一件事
<5-2,Amy>I gave you one job!

159
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,200
<5-2,Amy>帮我看着他
<5-2,Amy>Keep an eye on him.

160
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,770
<5-2,Amy>是有多难
<5-2,Amy>How hard is that?

161
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:49,870
<5-3,Penny>我们以为你说的看着他
<5-3,Penny>We thought you meant

162
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:53,580
<5-3,Penny>是别让他瞎跑到车流中
<5-3,Penny>not letting him run out into traffic.

163
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,220
<5-4,Bernadette>-他就瞎跑过一次  -对
<5-4,Bernadette>- Which he only did once. - Yeah.

164
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,840
<5-5,Amy>你们为什么不告诉我
<5-5,Amy>Why didn't you tell me?

165
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,580
<5-6,Bernadette>我们不想让你担心啊
<5-6,Bernadette>We didn't want you to worry.

166
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,980
<5-7,Amy>我该担心吗
<5-7,Amy>Should I worry?

167
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,310
<5-8,Penny>不用  拜托  那可是谢尔顿
<5-8,Penny>No. Come on, it's Sheldon.

168
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,920
<5-8,Penny>什么事都不会发生
<5-8,Penny>Nothing is gonna happen.

169
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,020
<5-9,Amy>我一开始跟他约会时  你也是这么说的
<5-9,Amy>That's what you said to me when I started dating him.

170
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,270
<5-9,Amy>现在五年过去了
<5-9,Amy>And then five years later,

171
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:12,260
<5-9,Amy>结果咧结果咧  有事发生了吧
<5-9,Amy>bingo-bango, something happened.

172
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,700
<5-10,Bernadette>是啊  但你三个月后就回来啦
<5-10,Bernadette>Yeah, but you're gonna be back in three months.

173
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,000
<5-10,Bernadette>你们不会明白
<5-10,Bernadette>You don't get it.

174
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,680
<5-11,Amy>那瓶番茄酱的屁股  老娘已经费劲拍了那么久
<5-11,Amy>I've been smacking that ketchup bottle for a long time.

175
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,180
<5-11,Amy>现在那女的只需要将它倒过来
<5-11,Amy>All she's got to do is tip it over

176
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:23,330
<5-11,Amy>对准她的薯条就能享受现成的了
<5-11,Amy>and point it at her fries.

177
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:24,980
<5-12,Penny>那你希望我们怎么做
<5-12,Penny>Well, what do you want us to do?

178
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,640
<5-12,Penny>我不知道
<5-12,Penny>I don't know.

179
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,870
<5-13,Amy>可能受了新泽西州讲话方式的影响
<5-13,Amy>Might be the New Jersey talking,

180
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:32,690
<5-13,Amy>但这个诺维茨基浪蹄子必须消失
<5-13,Amy>but this Nowitzki broad needs to disappear.

181
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,190
<5-14,Bernadette>用不用这样啊
<5-14,Bernadette>That's ridiculous.

182
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,240
<5-14,Bernadette>据我们所知
<5-14,Bernadette>As far as we know,

183
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,260
<5-14,Bernadette>就是两名科学家一起吃午餐
<5-14,Bernadette>all that happened is two scientists had lunch.

184
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,800
<5-15,Amy>是啊  可其中一名科学家
<5-15,Amy>Yeah, but one of those scientists

185
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,040
<5-15,Amy>是一名金发高妹的奥运游泳选手
<5-15,Amy>is a tall, blonde Olympic swimmer.

186
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,670
<5-16,Penny>拜托  外表对谢尔顿来说不重要
<5-16,Penny>Come on. Looks don't matter to Sheldon.

187
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:50,110
<5-16,Penny>因为他的眼中只有你
<5-16,Penny>Because he only has eyes for you.

188
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:51,410
<5-17,Amy>少拍马屁
<5-17,Amy>Nice try.

189
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:54,520
<5-18,Penny>多谢  我胡乱拼凑瞎说的
<5-18,Penny>Thanks. I was scrambling.

190
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,160
<6-1,Howard>真是不可理喻
<6-1,Howard>It's unbelievable.

191
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,910
<6-1,Howard>谢尔顿跟其他别人吃午餐
<6-1,Howard>Sheldon has lunch with another woman

192
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:02,690
<6-1,Howard>而我老婆居然把我吼了一顿
<6-1,Howard>and somehow my wife yells at me.

193
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,380
<6-2,Leonard>佩妮也把我骂了一顿
<6-2,Leonard>Penny laid into me, too.

194
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,240
<6-2,Leonard>显然  我过分专注在
<6-2,Leonard>Apparently, I'm overly fixated on

195
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,650
<6-2,Leonard>优质的瑞士巧克力棒上
<6-2,Leonard>premium Swiss chocolate bars.

196
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,660
<6-3,Raj>你应该不能吃那玩意吧
<6-3,Raj>Can you even eat those things?

197
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,670
<6-4,Leonard>提前一个半小时吃一片防胀气咀嚼片
<6-4,Leonard>If I take a Lactaid a half-hour before

198
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:16,000
<6-4,Leonard>吃完后马上吃止泻药就没事啊
<6-4,Leonard>and some Pepto right after.

199
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,600
<6-5,Raj>听起来很麻烦啊
<6-5,Raj>Sounds like a lot of work.

200
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,130
<6-6,Leonard>是啊  但也值了
<6-6,Leonard>Yeah. Eh, I'm worth it.

201
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:22,190
<6-7,Howard>伙计们  别偏题
<6-7,Howard>Guys. Focus.

202
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:24,190
<6-7,Howard>我们该对诺维茨基采取行动吗
<6-7,Howard>Should we do something about Nowitzki?

203
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,560
<6-8,Leonard>比如什么
<6-8,Leonard>Like what?

204
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,880
<6-9,Raj>她现在单身
<6-9,Raj>Uh, well, she's single,

205
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,890
<6-9,Raj>所以如果其他人约她出去  她答应的话
<6-9,Raj>so if somebody else asks her out and she says yes,

206
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:32,660
<6-9,Raj>就证明她对谢尔顿没兴趣
<6-9,Raj>then we know she's not into Sheldon.

207
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,640
<6-10,Stuart>我上吧
<6-10,Stuart>I'll do it.

208
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,050
<6-11,Leonard>无意冒犯  斯图尔特
<6-11,Leonard>No offense, Stuart,

209
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:43,290
<6-11,Leonard>但那位女性是个博士[医生]
<6-11,Leonard>but th-th-the woman's a doctor.

210
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:45,680
<6-12,Stuart>那又如何  医生都喜欢我
<6-12,Stuart>So? Doctors like me.

211
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,100
<6-12,Stuart>我每次去找我的医生看病
<6-12,Stuart>Whenever I see mine he calls in

212
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,990
<6-12,Stuart>他都叫很多其他医生进来看我
<6-12,Stuart>a bunch of other doctors to have a look.

213
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,380
<6-13,Howard>她不是那种医生
<6-13,Howard>She's not that kind of doctor.

214
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,220
<6-14,Stuart>那是她的损失
<6-14,Stuart>Well, her loss.

215
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:01,640
<6-14,Stuart>人称真医学奇葩就是我
<6-14,Stuart>I've been called a genuine medical oddity.

216
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:08,520
<6-15,Raj>其实我本来是想毛遂自荐
<6-15,Raj>Actually, I was going to suggest me.

217
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,830
<6-16,Howard>太好了  谁都比那谁强
<6-16,Howard>Great. Anybody's better than, mmm.

218
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,170
<6-16,Howard>不好意思
<6-16,Howard>Excuse me.

219
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:16,210
<6-17,Stuart>他们只取走了我的脾脏和胆囊
<6-17,Stuart>They took out my spleen and gallbladder,

220
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:18,650
<6-17,Stuart>我的情感还在
<6-17,Stuart>not my feelings.

221
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,230
<7-1,Raj>诺维茨基博士
<7-1,Raj>Dr. Nowitzki.

222
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:29,660
<7-2,Ramona>-很高兴见到你  -我也是
<7-2,Ramona>- Good to see you. - Good to see you, too.

223
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:30,780
<7-3,Raj>我能和你一起坐吗
<7-3,Raj>May I join you?

224
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,730
<7-4,Ramona>不能
<7-4,Ramona>No.

225
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,890
<7-5,Raj>很高兴见到你
<7-5,Raj>Good to see you.

226
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:43,100
<7-6,Howard>我们应该打给吉尼斯  那可能破了被拒绝速度的记录
<7-6,Howard>We should call Guinness, that might be a record.

227
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:45,670
<7-7,Raj>她一看就是正在吃工作午餐
<7-7,Raj>She's clearly having a working lunch

228
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:48,120
<7-7,Raj>不希望被打扰
<7-7,Raj>and preferred to eat alone.

229
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,120
<7-8,Ramona>库珀博士  这边
<7-8,Ramona>Dr. Cooper, over here.

230
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,330
<7-9,Raj>我本来可以让她很开心的
<7-9,Raj>I could have made her very happy.

231
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,540
<7-10,Leonard>你乖乖走开  我想她应该开心了
<7-10,Leonard>You kept walking. I think you did.

232
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,170
<8-1,Penny>你真觉得我们有理由担心吗
<8-1,Penny>Do you really think there's reason to worry?

233
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:05,560
<8-2,Leonard>是啊  她绝对在倒追谢尔顿
<8-2,Leonard>Yeah, she's definitely going after Sheldon.

234
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,900
<8-3,Raj>我勾引过她  但她拒绝我了
<8-3,Raj>I made a play for her and she shot me down.

235
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,480
<8-4,Penny>可那根本证明不了什么
<8-4,Penny>All right, well, that doesn't prove anything.

236
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,930
<8-5,Bernadette>是啊  女人有一百万个拒绝拉杰的原因
<8-5,Bernadette>Yeah, there's a million reasons a woman would shoot Raj down.

237
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,220
<8-6,Raj>真的吗  一百万个那么夸张
<8-6,Raj>Like, really, a million?

238
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,270
<8-7,Bernadette>好吧  几百个
<8-7,Bernadette>Fine, hundreds.

239
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:20,390
<8-8,Raj>谢谢你啊
<8-8,Raj>Thank you.

240
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:21,920
<8-9,Penny>重点是  这可能根本没什么
<8-9,Penny>The point is this could be nothing

241
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,550
<8-9,Penny>我们都反应过度了
<8-9,Penny>and we are all overreacting.

242
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:26,120
<8-10,Sheldon>大家好
<8-10,Sheldon>Hey, everybody.

243
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,180
<8-10,Sheldon>这位是我朋友
<8-10,Sheldon>This is my friend,

244
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,290
<8-10,Sheldon>-诺维茨基博士  -大家好
<8-10,Sheldon>- Dr. Nowitzki. - Hi.

245
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:32,110
<8-11,Ramona>你好
<8-11,Ramona>Hi.

246
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:35,260
<8-12,Sheldon>我们刚去游泳了
<8-12,Sheldon>We just went swimming.

247
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:42,190
<9-1,Leonard>你真的进泳池里了吗
<9-1,Leonard>And you actually got in a pool?

248
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:43,430
<9-2,Sheldon>我一开始怕得要死
<9-2,Sheldon>I was scared,

249
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:48,060
<9-2,Sheldon>但我告诉自己  这只是个大浴缸
<9-2,Sheldon>but I told myself it's just a big bathtub.

250
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,360
<9-2,Sheldon>然后我再度怕得要死
<9-2,Sheldon>Then I got scared again 'cause there are

251
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,190
<9-2,Sheldon>因为我浴缸里有很多陌生人
<9-2,Sheldon>all these strangers in my bathtub.

252
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,100
<9-3,Ramona>我为他感到骄傲
<9-3,Ramona>I was proud of him-- a lot of people

253
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,420
<9-3,Ramona>很多人第一天都不敢把脸埋进水里
<9-3,Ramona>don't put their face in the water on the first day.

254
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:59,660
<9-4,Sheldon>我是为了躲避一只蜜蜂  但那也算数
<9-4,Sheldon>Well, I was hiding from a bee, but it still counts.

255
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,690
<9-5,Bernadette>麻烦让个位子给我
<9-5,Bernadette>Can I just squeeze in here?

256
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,520
<9-6,Penny>谢尔顿  你跟艾米联系过了吗
<9-6,Penny>So, Sheldon, have you talked to Amy?

257
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,090
<9-7,Sheldon>有啊  我们今早视频聊天了
<9-7,Sheldon>Yes, we Skyped this morning

258
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:13,340
<9-7,Sheldon>我睡前会再跟她联系一次
<9-7,Sheldon>and I'm sure I'll check in with her before I go to sleep.

259
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,920
<9-8,Ramona>谢尔顿总说起她
<9-8,Ramona>Sheldon talks about her all the time.

260
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,030
<9-8,Ramona>我等不及见她了
<9-8,Ramona>I can't wait to meet her.

261
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,200
<9-9,Sheldon>真的
<9-9,Sheldon>That is true.

262
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,940
<9-9,Sheldon>她一直在问艾米会离开多久
<9-9,Sheldon>She keeps asking how long Amy's going to be gone.

263
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:24,680
<9-10,Leonard>拉蒙娜  自我介绍一下吧
<9-10,Leonard>Uh, so, Ramona, tell us about yourself.

264
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,150
<9-10,Leonard>你有男朋友吗
<9-10,Leonard>Do you, do you have a boyfriend?

265
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,680
<9-11,Sheldon>莱纳德  你老婆就坐在旁边
<9-11,Sheldon>Leonard, your wife is sitting right here.

266
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,040
<9-11,Sheldon>你干嘛呢
<9-11,Sheldon>What are you doing?

306
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:09,790
<10-11,Ramona>喂
<10-11,Ramona>Hello.

307
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:12,540
<10-12,Amy>有点迟了  莱纳德
<10-12,Amy>A little late, Leonard.

308
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:14,670
<10-12,Amy>对不起
<10-12,Amy>I'm sorry.

309
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:17,450
<10-13,Sheldon>莱纳德这个时候打电话给你做什么
<10-13,Sheldon>What is Leonard doing calling you at this hour?

310
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:18,910
<10-14,Amy>这不重要
<10-14,Amy>It's not important.

311
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:22,880
<10-15,Sheldon>我得跟你说  这样似乎有点不合适
<10-15,Sheldon>I must tell you, that seems a little inappropriate.

312
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,830
<10-15,Sheldon>你同意吗
<10-15,Sheldon>Don't you agree?

313
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:24,940
<10-16,Ramona>同意
<10-16,Ramona>I do.

314
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,550
<10-16,Ramona>瞧
<10-16,Ramona>See?

315
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:29,170
<10-17,Sheldon>我们都这样认为
<10-17,Sheldon>We both think so.

316
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,540
<11-1,Penny>好了  我快疯了
<11-1,Penny>All right, this is making me crazy.

317
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,220
<11-1,Penny>你们谁过去一下
<11-1,Penny>Somebody's got to go over there.

318
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:37,090
<11-2,Leonard>你有腿有脚  你去啊
<11-2,Leonard>You got feet and legs, you do it.

319
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,570
<11-3,Penny>你要和我一起去吗
<11-3,Penny>Will you go with me?

320
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:44,450
<11-4,Bernadette>去了做什么  冲他们摇硬币罐吗
<11-4,Bernadette>To do what? Shake a can of nickels at them?

321
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,800
<11-5,Raj>我们太杞人忧天了
<11-5,Raj>We're being ridiculous.

322
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,960
<11-5,Raj>那么漂亮的女人是不可能
<11-5,Raj>There's no way a woman that attractive

323
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,800
<11-5,Raj>试图勾引谢尔顿·库珀的
<11-5,Raj>is trying to seduce Sheldon Cooper.

324
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,940
<11-6,Howard>你的自我安慰牌打完了没
<11-6,Howard>You done trying to make yourself feel better?

325
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,380
<11-7,Raj>没  我还没打种族歧视牌呢
<11-7,Raj>No. I haven't played the race card yet.

326
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,710
<11-8,Sheldon>我也不想打断聚会
<11-8,Sheldon>Hey, I hate to break up the party,

327
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:07,570
<11-8,Sheldon>但艾米说我累了  必须上床睡觉
<11-8,Sheldon>but Amy says I'm tired and have to go to bed.

328
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:10,750
<11-9,Ramona>很高兴见到大家
<11-9,Ramona>It was nice seeing everybody.

329
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,060
<11-9,Ramona>多谢你们的晚餐
<11-9,Ramona>Thank you for dinner.

330
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:12,960
<11-11,Leonard>-不客气  -我们的荣幸
<11-11,Leonard>- Sure. - Our pleasure.

331
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,890
<11-12,Raj>随便啦
<11-12,Raj>Whatever.

332
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,130
<11-13,Ramona>要送我上车吗
<11-13,Ramona>Walk me to my car?

333
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:18,180
<11-14,Sheldon>当然
<11-14,Sheldon>Of course.

334
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,230
<11-15,Penny>我们一起送
<11-15,Penny>We'll all go.

335
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:37,860
<11-16,Bernadette>借过
<11-16,Bernadette>Excuse me.

336
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:51,470
<11-17,Penny>不好意思  我过去下  好了
<11-17,Penny>Pardon. I just need to... yeah.

337
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:03,090
<11-18,Sheldon>真好玩
<11-18,Sheldon>That was fun.

338
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:05,370
<11-18,Sheldon>像玩"马里奥赛车"
<11-18,Sheldon>It was like Mario Kart.

339
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,000
<12-1,Sheldon>拜
<12-1,Sheldon>Bye.

340
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,530
<12-2,Penny>我们需要谈谈
<12-2,Penny>We need to talk.

341
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:14,170
<12-3,Sheldon>是关于莱纳德和艾米的事吗
<12-3,Sheldon>Wh-- Is this about Leonard and Amy?

342
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:16,390
<12-3,Sheldon>我也不爽
<12-3,Sheldon>I don't like it either.

343
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:22,130
<12-3,Sheldon>我知道你在女人方面经验不足
<12-3,Sheldon>Okay, I know you don't have a lot of experience with women,

344
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,470
<13-1,Penny>但拉蒙娜似乎
<13-1,Penny>but Ramona seems to have

345
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:26,050
<13-1,Penny>对你有意思
<13-1,Penny>a romantic interest in you.

346
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,550
<13-2,Sheldon>这根本没道理
<13-2,Sheldon>That doesn't make any sense.

347
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,210
<13-2,Sheldon>她知道我有女朋友
<13-2,Sheldon>She knows I have a girlfriend.

348
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:31,140
<13-3,Penny>有时候女人不在乎
<13-3,Penny>Well, sometimes women don't care.

349
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:34,290
<13-3,Penny>有时候这令她们更想要这个男人
<13-3,Penny>Sometimes it makes them want a guy even more.

350
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:35,760
<13-4,Sheldon>可能是这样
<13-4,Sheldon>That may be true,

351
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,890
<13-4,Sheldon>但诺维茨基博士只是朋友
<13-4,Sheldon>but Dr. Nowitzki's just a friend.

352
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:40,450
<13-4,Sheldon>事实上  如果她没穿那件突显
<13-4,Sheldon>In fact, I wouldn't have even noticed she's a woman

353
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:45,110
<13-4,Sheldon>她胸部的泳衣的话  我都没注意到她是女人
<13-4,Sheldon>if she hadn't worn that bathing suit that highlighted her bosom.

354
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,180
<13-5,Penny>好吧  我们换个说法
<13-5,Penny>Okay. Um... ...let's try this.

355
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,990
<13-5,Penny>把你自己想象成那种
<13-5,Penny>Think of yourself as one of those

356
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:54,580
<13-5,Penny>人们喜欢收集的限量版玩具公仔
<13-5,Penny>limited edition toys people like to collect.

357
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,960
<13-6,Sheldon>我一直是这样想的
<13-6,Sheldon>I already do.

358
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,460
<13-7,Penny>那你就会明白了
<13-7,Penny>Well, then you get it.

359
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,530
<13-8,Sheldon>因为我是独一无二的
<13-8,Sheldon>Because there's only one of me,

360
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:03,710
<13-8,Sheldon>我更有价值
<13-8,Sheldon>I'm more valuable.

361
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:05,000
<13-9,Penny>对了
<13-9,Penny>Right.

362
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,220
<13-10,Sheldon>不过  艾米已经把我从包装盒中拿出来
<13-10,Sheldon>Although, Amy's already taken me out of my package

363
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,810
<13-10,Sheldon>玩过了  我掉价了
<13-10,Sheldon>and played with me.

364
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,700
<13-11,Penny>别管玩具这个比喻了
<13-11,Penny>Let's forget the toy thing, okay?

365
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,400
<13-12,Sheldon>-也许  -佩妮  感谢你的关心
<13-12,Sheldon>- Um, maybe... - Penny, look. I appreciate your concern,

366
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,580
<13-12,Sheldon>但我不觉得事情是这样的
<13-12,Sheldon>but I don't think that's what's happening.

367
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:24,450
<13-13,Penny>好吧  你觉得事情是怎样的
<13-13,Penny>All right. What do you think is happening?

368
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,740
<13-14,Sheldon>我觉得诺维茨基博士是一位友好的同事
<13-14,Sheldon>I think Dr. Nowitzki is a friendly colleague.

369
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:32,130
<13-14,Sheldon>我觉得你和莱纳德需要见婚姻咨询师
<13-14,Sheldon>I think you and Leonard need to see a marriage counselor.

370
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:34,550
<13-14,Sheldon>我需要去更新简历
<13-14,Sheldon>And I need to update my resume

371
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:37,730
<13-14,Sheldon>加上游泳这项特殊技能
<13-14,Sheldon>to include swimming as a special skill.

372
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:47,730
<13-15,Penny>别这样看着我  我尽力了
<13-15,Penny>Don't look at me like that, I tried.

373
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,430
<14-1,Ramona>你吃了吗
<14-1,Ramona>Hey, did you eat yet?

374
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:57,840
<14-2,Sheldon>吃了早餐  没吃中餐
<14-2,Sheldon>Uh, breakfast yes, lunch no.

375
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,140
<14-2,Sheldon>我服用了止咳糖
<14-2,Sheldon>I did have a cough drop,

376
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:03,120
<14-2,Sheldon>但这是介于吸和吃之间的行为
<14-2,Sheldon>but that really rides the line between sucking and eating.

377
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:05,360
<14-3,Ramona>太好了  我给咱俩做了三明治
<14-3,Ramona>Well, perfect. I made us sandwiches.

378
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,460
<14-4,Sheldon>真是周到
<14-4,Sheldon>How thoughtful.

379
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,660
<14-4,Sheldon>谢谢你
<14-4,Sheldon>Thank you.

380
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,680
<14-5,Ramona>没什么
<14-5,Ramona>No big deal,

381
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,430
<14-5,Ramona>我喜欢和你在一起
<14-5,Ramona>I enjoy spending time with you.

382
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,790
<14-6,Sheldon>我也是
<14-6,Sheldon>And I with you.

383
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:16,000
<14-6,Sheldon>问一下
<14-6,Sheldon>Question:

384
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,110
<14-6,Sheldon>你是想和我发展恋爱关系吗
<14-6,Sheldon>are you seeking a romantic relationship with me?

385
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,270
<14-7,Ramona>如果我是呢
