19
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:44,140
<1-12,Sheldon>我又不是小浣熊
<1-12,Sheldon>I'm not a raccoon.

20
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:47,110
<1-13,Howard>你要是累了  就去喝点咖啡
<1-13,Howard>If you're tired, have some coffee.

<1-14,Sheldon>什么  你才该去喝咖啡吧
<1-14,Sheldon>What? You have some coffee.

<1-16,Sheldon>-你看你喝完人多暴躁  -两位
<1-16,Sheldon>- And look how irritable it's making you! - Guys!

24

<1-17,Leonard>只要一开始吵架  肯定啥也干不了了
<1-17,Leonard>We're not gonna get anything done if we start fighting.

25
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:58,660
<1-17,Leonard>你能不能爷们点  撑过去
<1-17,Leonard>Now, can you please try to soldier through?

26
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:00,860
<1-17,Leonard>好吧
<1-17,Leonard>Fine.

27
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,200
<1-18,Sheldon>我觉得我撑不了多久了
<1-18,Sheldon>I don't think I can go much longer.

28
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,910
<1-19,Leonard>才过了三分半钟好吗  给我醒来
<1-19,Leonard>It's been three and a half minutes, wake up!

38
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,330
<2-1,Sheldon>我做了一个恶梦  梦到我最好的朋友
<2-1,Sheldon>I had a bad dream that my best friend became a tyrant

39
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:55,880
<2-1,Sheldon>变成了一个暴君  逼我彻夜工作
<2-1,Sheldon>and forced me to stay up all night to work.

40
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,900
<2-2,Leonard>我做了一个美梦  梦到我抱你上床睡时
<2-2,Leonard>Oh, I had a good dream that when I carried you to bed,

41
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:01,200
<2-2,Leonard>你的头撞到墙  然后我开怀大笑
<2-2,Leonard>I let your head hit the wall and I laughed.

42
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:02,900
<2-3,Penny>早安
<2-3,Penny>Good morning.

43
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:03,770
<2-4,Leonard>这是在干嘛
<2-4,Leonard>What is this?

44
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:05,430
<2-5,Amy>我们昨晚都没见着你们
<2-5,Amy>Well, we didn't see you last night,

45
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,610
<2-5,Amy>今天也见不到你们
<2-5,Amy>we're not gonna see you today,

46
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:08,560
<2-5,Amy>所以就想好歹一起吃顿早饭
<2-5,Amy>so we thought we could have breakfast together.

47
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,040
<2-6,Leonard>这样真好
<2-6,Leonard>Oh, that is so nice.

48
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,630
<2-7,Sheldon>真的会疼呢
<2-7,Sheldon>Ow, it does hurt!

49
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:15,450
<2-8,Leonard>所以你们今天打算干嘛
<2-8,Leonard>So, what are you guys gonna do today?

50
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:18,110
<2-9,Amy>本来今天下午谢尔顿该陪我去个派对
<2-9,Amy>Well, Sheldon was supposed to go to this party with me this afternoon,

51
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,420
<2-9,Amy>但我想这事是没戏了
<2-9,Amy>but I don't think that's happening.

52
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,340
<2-10,Sheldon>从一开始就没有戏过
<2-10,Sheldon>Oh, that was never happening.

53
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:23,000
<2-11,Penny>那我陪你去
<2-11,Penny>Oh, I'll go.

54
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,130
<2-11,Penny>我喜欢参加派对
<2-11,Penny>I like a party.

55
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:26,910
<2-12,Amy>不瞒你说  不是平常说的那种"派对"
<2-12,Amy>Well, to be honest, it's not like a "party" party,

56
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,120
<2-12,Amy>反而更像是个聚会
<2-12,Amy>it's more like a gathering

57
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,230
<2-12,Amy>就是不同领域的科学家们聚集在一起
<2-12,Amy>where scientists of different disciplines get together

58
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:31,070
<2-12,Amy>分享研究成果
<2-12,Amy>to share their work

59
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:32,920
<2-12,Amy>以及讨论其他科研领域的最新情况
<2-12,Amy>and keep current on what's going on in other fields.

60
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,450
<2-12,Amy>我也不知道我为啥称这为派对  对不起
<2-12,Amy>I don't know why I called it a party, sorry.

61
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,290
<2-13,Penny>没关系  我还是愿意去
<2-13,Penny>It's okay, I'll still go.

62
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,600
<2-14,Leonard>你不觉得你会感到无聊吗
<2-14,Leonard>You don't think you'll be bored?

63
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,900
<2-15,Penny>我就喝点酒
<2-15,Penny>Oh, I'll have some wine

64
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,190
<2-15,Penny>然后听听别人聊点我屁都不懂的事情
<2-15,Penny>and listen to people go on about crap I don't understand.

65
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:45,810
<2-15,Penny>这跟我每天的生活又有什么不同呢
<2-15,Penny>I mean, how is it any different than every single day of my life?

66
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,200
<2-16,Sheldon>可我不会在场啊
<2-16,Sheldon>I won't be there.

67
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,720
<2-17,Leonard>哎妈  还真是个派对
<2-17,Leonard>Look at that, it is a party.

00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:54,710
<3-1,Howard>抱歉我整个周末都得工作
<3-1,Howard>Sorry I have to work all weekend.

<3-2,Bernadette>没关系
<3-2,Bernadette>It's okay.

<3-7,Bernadette>但你的休息日不用浪费来陪我啦
<3-7,Bernadette>but you don't have to spend your day off with me.

77
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,220
<3-7,Bernadette>我不介意啊
<3-7,Bernadette>Well, I don't mind.

<5-5,Bert>也是一名说笑达人
<5-5,Bert>And a joker.

130
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:35,600
<5-6,Penny>我们早到很久吗
<5-6,Penny>How early are we?

131
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,090
<5-7,Amy>其实我们晚到了一个小时
<5-7,Amy>Oh, actually, we're an hour late.

132
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:41,780
<5-8,Penny>突然好希望谢尔顿在这儿
<5-8,Penny>I suddenly wish Sheldon was here.

133
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,270
<6-1,Bernadette>我都不知道该从哪里开始收拾
<6-1,Bernadette>I don't even know where to begin.

134
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:51,120
<6-2,Raj>《音乐之声》的女主角曾说
<6-2,Raj>Well, in The Sound of Music, Julie Andrews says,

136
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,380
<6-2,Raj>"让我们从头开始
<6-2,Raj>"Let's start at the very beginning.

137
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,870
<6-2,Raj>那是个适合开始的好地方"
<6-2,Raj>A very good place to start."

138
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:57,670
<6-3,Bernadette>我本来还打算从尾开始呢
<6-3,Bernadette>Oh, I was gonna start at the end.

139
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,660
<6-3,Bernadette>真是要"谢谢你"呀
<6-3,Bernadette>Thank God you're here.

140
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,030
<6-4,Raj>我觉得首先需要扔掉的东西是
<6-4,Raj>Well, I think the first thing we should get rid of is

141
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,860
<6-4,Raj>你这态度
<6-4,Raj>that tone.

142
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,580
<6-4,Raj>对不起
<6-4,Raj>Sorry.

143
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,480
<6-5,Bernadette>我应该留着这个  万一生了个女儿呢
<6-5,Bernadette>I should probably keep this in case we have a girl.

144
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,860
<6-6,Raj>这小房子真可爱
<6-6,Raj>Oh, that's a nice one.

145
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,110
<6-6,Raj>是你小时候的东西吗
<6-6,Raj>Was it yours when you were little?

146
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:14,380
<6-7,Bernadette>我爸爸给我做的
<6-7,Bernadette>My dad built it for me.

147
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,540
<6-8,Raj>真有爱
<6-8,Raj>Wow, it's so cute.

148
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,910
<6-9,Bernadette>这个是老公  这个是老婆
<6-9,Bernadette>This was the husband and this was the wife.

149
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:21,090
<6-9,Bernadette>他们会一起去冒险
<6-9,Bernadette>They'd go out on adventures together.

150
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:23,410
<6-9,Bernadette>游山玩水  滑雪骑马
<6-9,Bernadette>Cruises, skiing, horseback riding.

151
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:27,050
<6-9,Bernadette>其实就是用胶带把他们粘在我家狗上
<6-9,Bernadette>That was really me just duct taping them to our dog.

152
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,560
<6-10,Raj>他们有孩子吗
<6-10,Raj>Oh, and did they have kids?

153
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,470
<6-11,Bernadette>有啊
<6-11,Bernadette>They did,

154
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:31,070
<6-11,Bernadette>可惜他俩不喜欢孩子
<6-11,Bernadette>but the mommy and daddy didn't like them,

155
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,690
<6-11,Bernadette>所以他们把孩子送到
<6-11,Bernadette>so they shipped them off to an orphanage

156
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:34,630
<6-11,Bernadette>我用鞋盒做的孤儿院
<6-11,Bernadette>I made out of a shoebox.

157
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,930
<6-12,Raj>听了完全不会让人担心啊
<6-12,Raj>Yeah, that's not worrisome at all.

158
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,760
<6-13,Bernadette>不是每一个女生都梦想当妈
<6-13,Bernadette>Not every girl dreams about being a mom.

159
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,850
<6-13,Bernadette>可能有时你觉得永远都不会有小孩
<6-13,Bernadette>Sometimes you think you're never gonna have kids

160
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,740
<6-13,Bernadette>结果某天醒来就发现自己怀孕了
<6-13,Bernadette>and one day you wake up and you're pregnant.

161
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,610
<6-13,Bernadette>哪怕自己的事业正蒸蒸日上
<6-13,Bernadette>And it doesn't matter that your career's going great right now

162
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:50,860
<6-13,Bernadette>而且从没有过跟老公被粘狗身上
<6-13,Bernadette>and that you and your husband never even got to go anywhere

163
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:53,300
<6-13,Bernadette>去游山玩水的机会
<6-13,Bernadette>taped to a dog!

164
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,770
<6-14,Raj>我居然为了这个翘了动感单车课
<6-14,Raj>I skipped spin class for this.

165
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:03,180
<7-1,Howard>他怎么能去这么久
<7-1,Howard>Why is it taking him so long

166
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,130
<7-1,Howard>不就从自动贩售机买瓶喝的吗
<7-1,Howard>to get a drink out of a vending machine?

167
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:06,770
<7-2,Leonard>你估计很难理解
<7-2,Leonard>Oh, it's complicated.

168
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:08,230
<7-2,Leonard>他对推开那扇小门
<7-2,Leonard>He finds pushing that little door

169
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:12,600
<7-2,Leonard>伸手进机器里拿东西的亲密度  感到不舒服
<7-2,Leonard>and reaching up into the machine uncomfortably intimate.

170
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:15,440
<7-3,Sheldon>男士们  我准备好开工了
<7-3,Sheldon>Gentlemen, I am ready to work.

171
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,690
<7-3,Sheldon>引用《火星救援》的台词"我得用科学大展屎威了"
<7-3,Sheldon>To quote The Martian, "Let's science the feces out of this!"

172
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:20,550
<7-3,Sheldon>我说的是《火星救援》这本书和同名电影
<7-3,Sheldon>That's The Martian the book and The Martian the movie,

173
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:21,720
<7-3,Sheldon>不是《火星人马文》
<7-3,Sheldon>not Marvin the Martian.

174
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,150
<7-3,Sheldon>要不也引用一下卡通《火星人马文》好了
<7-3,Sheldon>Although to quote Marvin the Martian,

175
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:26,820
<7-3,Sheldon>"我以火星的名义宣布  这星球归我了"
<7-3,Sheldon>"I claim this planet in the name of Mars."

176
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,260
<7-4,Leonard>你还好吧
<7-4,Leonard>Are you okay?

177
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,230
<7-5,Sheldon>好极了  从来没这么好过
<7-5,Sheldon>Oh, I'm fantastic, never been better.

178
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:32,480
<7-5,Sheldon>我喝了人生第一瓶功能饮料  自我感觉棒棒哒
<7-5,Sheldon>I had my first energy drink and I feel great.

179
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,790
<7-5,Sheldon>你们想玩摔跤吗
<7-5,Sheldon>Hey, you guys want to wrestle?

180
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,710
<7-5,Sheldon>我们可以掰手腕  掰拇指  泥浆摔跤  相扑
<7-5,Sheldon>We can do arm, thumb, mud, sumo.

181
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:38,600
<7-5,Sheldon>算了  我们不够胖  也没穿着尿布
<7-5,Sheldon>Nah, we're not fat enough, or wearing diapers.

182
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:43,640
<7-6,Howard>是你要他保持清醒状态的
<7-6,Howard>You wanted him awake.

183
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:58,990
<8-1,Penny>我们该只跟对方说话  还是去交际啊
<8-1,Penny>So should we talk to each other or mingle?

184
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:01,410
<8-2,Amy>我不知道其他人上哪儿了
<8-2,Amy>I don't know where everyone is.

185
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:02,040
<8-3,Penny>是啊  我是说
<8-3,Penny>Yeah, I mean,

186
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,430
<8-3,Penny>我可以想象他吃了一个或两个客人
<8-3,Penny>I could see him eating one or two guests,

187
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:06,850
<8-3,Penny>但吃光一群也太扯了吧
<8-3,Penny>but not a whole party.

188
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,800
<8-4,Bert>这派对有点失败
<8-4,Bert>Well, I guess this is kind of a bust.

189
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,140
<8-4,Bert>你们想走就走吧
<8-4,Bert>You don't have to stay.

190
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,020
<8-4,Bert>我要开始打扫了
<8-4,Bert>I'm gonna start cleaning up.

191
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,380
<8-4,Bert>好吧
<8-4,Bert>Okay.

192
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,510
<8-5,Amy>把他扔在这里我会很内疚的
<8-5,Amy>I feel so bad about leaving him here.

193
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:19,790
<8-6,Penny>真有意思  我刚想扔下你时也觉得内疚
<8-6,Penny>Oh, it's funny, I was just thinking the same thing about you.

194
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:22,050
<8-7,Bert>听着
<8-7,Bert>Hey, listen,

195
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:24,090
<8-7,Bert>你能不能别把这件事
<8-7,Bert>could you not say anything about this

196
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:26,210
<8-7,Bert>告诉大学里的人
<8-7,Bert>to the people at the university?

197
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:27,300
<8-7,Bert>因为...
<8-7,Bert>You know, 'cause...

198
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,530
<8-7,Bert>你是如此...  而我...  这有点丢人
<8-7,Bert>you're you and I'm me, and it's kind of embarrassing.

199
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:32,750
<8-8,Penny>等等  "她是如此..."是什么意思
<8-8,Penny>Wait, what do you mean "she's her"?

200
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,900
<8-9,Bert>艾米是大学里最酷的女生  不是吗
<8-9,Bert>Well, you know how Amy's the coolest girl on campus, right?

201
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,890
<8-10,Penny>-当然不是  -当然不是
<8-10,Penny>- No. - No.

202
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:40,240
<8-12,Bert>真的  大家都这么觉得
<8-12,Bert>Oh yeah, everybody thinks so.

203
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:40,970
<8-12,Bert>什么
<8-12,Bert>What?

204
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:44,650
<8-13,Penny>你得了脚气就告诉我  反而这事藏着掖着啊
<8-13,Penny>You tell me about your foot fungus, but this is a secret?

205
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:48,370
<8-14,Amy>我敢说肯定是因为我的男友是谢尔顿
<8-14,Amy>I'm sure it's just 'cause I'm dating Sheldon.

206
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:50,390
<8-15,Bert>老实说  谢尔顿之所以受欢迎
<8-15,Bert>Mm, actually, I think Sheldon's popular

207
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:52,600
<8-15,Bert>是因为他的女友是你
<8-15,Bert>because he's dating you.

208
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:55,310
<8-16,Penny>现在谢尔顿居然受人欢迎了
<8-16,Penny>Now Sheldon's popular?

209
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:57,580
<8-16,Penny>到底是什么状况啊
<8-16,Penny>What is happening?

210
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:02,940
<9-1,Howard>或许我们该休息吃个午餐
<9-1,Howard>Maybe we should break for lunch.

211
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,150
<9-1,Howard>几点了
<9-1,Howard>What time is it?

212
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:11,380
<9-2,Leonard>史上最烂的布谷鸟报时钟刚说  两点了
<9-2,Leonard>According to the world's worst cuckoo clock, it's 2:00.

213
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,130
<9-3,Sheldon>我的头好疼
<9-3,Sheldon>My head hurts

214
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:15,650
<9-3,Sheldon>我此生第一次这么累
<9-3,Sheldon>and I'm more tired than ever.

215
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:16,620
<9-4,Howard>你干嘛不回家
<9-4,Howard>Why don't you just go home?

216
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,580
<9-5,Sheldon>不  我能撑下去
<9-5,Sheldon>No, I can do this.

217
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:21,640
<9-5,Sheldon>我...我只需再来一瓶功能饮料
<9-5,Sheldon>I just, I just need another energy drink.

218
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,420
<9-6,Leonard>糟糕
<9-6,Leonard>Oh, no.

219
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:25,070
<9-6,Leonard>怎么了
<9-6,Leonard>What?

220
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:26,550
<9-7,Sheldon>我想再来一瓶
<9-7,Sheldon>I want another one.

221
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:27,640
<9-8,Leonard>所以呢
<9-8,Leonard>So?

222
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,260
<9-9,Sheldon>那是一种渴求
<9-9,Sheldon>That's a craving.

223
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:32,010
<9-9,Sheldon>药物依赖的征兆
<9-9,Sheldon>That's a sign of chemical dependency.

224
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,020
<9-10,Leonard>你才喝了一瓶
<9-10,Leonard>You only had one.

225
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:34,990
<9-10,Leonard>不  我知道
<9-10,Leonard>No, I know,

226
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:37,830
<9-11,Sheldon>但很多事物只要试一次就会上瘾
<9-11,Sheldon>but plenty of things are addictive after a single exposure.

227
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:41,830
<9-11,Sheldon>比如说可卡因  尼古丁  品客薯片
<9-11,Sheldon>I mean, crack cocaine, nicotine, Pringles.

228
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:44,600
<9-11,Sheldon>根本停不下来
<9-11,Sheldon>You know once one pops one just can't stop.

229
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,360
<9-12,Howard>你哪有可能这么快就染上瘾
<9-12,Howard>You can't develop a problem that fast.

230
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,630
<9-13,Sheldon>你要打赌吗  这下好了
<9-13,Sheldon>You want to bet? Oh, great,

231
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,620
<9-13,Sheldon>我现在还染上赌瘾了
<9-13,Sheldon>now I'm addicted to gambling.

232
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,990
<9-14,Leonard>我们没时间浪费了
<9-14,Leonard>We can't afford to lose any more time.

233
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:00,440
<9-15,Howard>虽然可能没多大用  但你们曾经试过
<9-15,Howard>Well, this probably won't work, but has anyone ever tried

234
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,180
<9-15,Howard>运起12成功力  打他个茅塞顿开吗
<9-15,Howard>to just haul off and whoop the crazy out of him?

235
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,680
<9-16,Leonard>这个建议完全没有帮助
<9-16,Leonard>That's not helpful.

236
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,590
<9-16,Leonard>虽然想起来爽翻了  但没有实质帮助
<9-16,Leonard>It's fun to think about, but it's not helpful.

237
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:14,440
<9-16,Leonard>谢尔顿  我们时间非常紧张
<9-16,Leonard>Hey, Sheldon, we are on a serious time crunch.

238
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,740
<9-16,Leonard>没有你我们根本完成不了
<9-16,Leonard>We can't do this without you.

239
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,050
<9-16,Leonard>拜托你别演大戏了好不好
<9-16,Leonard>Can you please pull it together?

240
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,380
<9-17,Sheldon>抱歉  我会好好振作的
<9-17,Sheldon>I'm sorry. Yes, of course.

241
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,650
<9-18,Leonard>谢了
<9-18,Leonard>Thank you.

242
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,860
<9-19,Sheldon>也请两位在我出现
<9-19,Sheldon>Just, please, bear with me

243
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:26,150
<9-19,Sheldon>咖啡因脱瘾症状时尽量包容一下
<9-19,Sheldon>if I display symptoms of caffeine withdrawal.

244
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,650
<9-20,Howard>没问题
<9-20,Howard>No worries.

245
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,070
<9-21,Sheldon>你们俩身上好臭
<9-21,Sheldon>You guys stink.

247
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,460
<10-1,Bernadette>抱歉对你发脾气了
<10-1,Bernadette>Sorry I flipped out on you.

248
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,290
<10-1,Bernadette>都是这孕期荷尔蒙惹的祸
<10-1,Bernadette>I think it's just hormones.

249
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:57,910
<10-2,Raj>我看你怀孕前就是一副晚娘脸了
<10-2,Raj>I think you were mean before you were pregnant,

250
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,370
<10-2,Raj>不过没关系
<10-2,Raj>but it's fine.

251
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,400
<10-2,Raj>咱们先暂缓收拾房间吧
<10-2,Raj>So, uh, instead of cleaning out the room,

252
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,020
<10-2,Raj>不如先决定一下婴儿房的主题怎么样
<10-2,Raj>why don't we just decide on a theme for the nursery?

253
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,630
<10-3,Bernadette>婴儿房还需要主题吗
<10-3,Bernadette>Does it really need one?

254
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:09,060
<10-4,Raj>当然需要了
<10-4,Raj>Of course it does.

255
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,170
<10-4,Raj>你小时候的闺房没有主题吗
<10-4,Raj>Didn't your baby room have a theme?

256
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,860
<10-5,Bernadette>我的闺房同时也是我爸的办公室
<10-5,Bernadette>Well, it doubled as my dad's office,

257
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:13,980
<10-5,Bernadette>他又是个警察
<10-5,Bernadette>and he was a cop,

258
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,850
<10-5,Bernadette>所以主题大概就是鲜血淋漓的凶案照片
<10-5,Bernadette>so I guess the theme was bloody homicide photos.

259
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:20,900
<10-6,Raj>我的主题是小熊维尼
<10-6,Raj>Oh. Mine was Winnie the Pooh.

260
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,270
<10-6,Raj>总之...
<10-6,Raj>But anyway...

261
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:26,430
<10-6,Raj>我们先从最基本的开始
<10-6,Raj>why don't we just take a step back

262
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:27,830
<10-6,Raj>先挑一个颜色吧
<10-6,Raj>and start with a color?

263
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,460
<10-6,Raj>颜色的挑选可就五花八门了
<10-6,Raj>Right? There are so many amazing ones.

264
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:32,310
<10-6,Raj>红色啊  蓝色啊  绿色啊  紫色啊...
<10-6,Raj>Red, blue, green, purple...

265
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:34,770
<10-7,Bernadette>你是不是要把所有的颜色都说一遍啊
<10-7,Bernadette>Are you just gonna name all the colors?

266
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:37,730
<10-8,Raj>你这样我不敢说了
<10-8,Raj>Well, not now.

267
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:40,630
<10-9,Bernadette>房间什么颜色随便啦
<10-9,Bernadette>I don't care what color the room is.

268
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,050
<10-10,Raj>好  好  我只是想帮你而已
<10-10,Raj>Okay, well, I'm just trying to help you.

269
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:44,360
<10-11,Bernadette>帮忙个屁  闭嘴吧
<10-11,Bernadette>Well, you're not, so just drop it!

270
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:51,100
<10-11,Bernadette>人家明显不开心了  你为啥还不跟过来
<10-11,Bernadette>I'm clearly upset. Why aren't you following me?

271
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,740
<10-12,Raj>这就来  这就来
<10-12,Raj>Sorry! Sorry!

272
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:57,980
<11-1,Bert>当艾米开始用铬酸和白醋的调和剂
<11-1,Bert>And when Amy started using a solution of chromic acid

273
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:00,720
<11-1,Bert>清洗她的实验室器材后
<11-1,Bert>and white vinegar to clean all her lab equipment,

274
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,330
<11-1,Bert>瞬时间  每个人都开始这么做了
<11-1,Bert>all of a sudden, everybody was doing it.

275
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:07,230
<11-2,Penny>你真是潮流引导者啊
<11-2,Penny>You trend setter!

276
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:09,570
<11-3,Amy>我只是在恰当的时间做了恰当的事
<11-3,Amy>Just the right idea at the right time.

277
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:13,210
<11-4,Penny>好了好了  艾米很酷  谢尔顿也很酷
<11-4,Penny>Okay, okay, so Amy's cool, Sheldon's cool.

278
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:15,260
<11-4,Penny>-再跟我说说莱纳德  -谁啊
<11-4,Penny>- Tell me about Leonard. - Who?

279
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,940
<11-6,Penny>莱纳德·霍夫斯塔德
<11-6,Penny>Leonard Hofstadter.

280
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,930
<11-7,Bert>他啊  他还凑合吧
<11-7,Bert>Oh, him. I guess he's all right.

281
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:25,320
<11-7,Bert>他貌似骗到了一个大美女结婚呢
<11-7,Bert>Apparently he tricked some hot girl into marrying him.

282
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,970
<11-8,Penny>大美女就是我
<11-8,Penny>That's me, I'm her.

283
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:29,470
<11-8,Penny>他没有骗我啦
<11-8,Penny>You know, he didn't trick me.

284
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:32,030
<11-8,Penny>他只是纠缠得放弃挣扎而已
<11-8,Penny>He just wore me down.

285
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,700
<11-9,Bert>怪不得你俩是好闺蜜
<11-9,Bert>It makes sense you two are friends.

286
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,220
<11-9,Bert>美女们总是抱团玩在一起
<11-9,Bert>I mean, hot girls always stick together.

287
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:42,790
<11-10,Amy>你之前还觉得这个派对不会好玩呢
<11-10,Amy>And you thought this wasn't gonna be a great party.

288
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,600
<11-11,Penny>我还真没想到
<11-11,Penny>You know, I had no idea

289
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,610
<11-11,Penny>加州理工大学和我高中简直是一样一样的
<11-11,Penny>Caltech is exactly like my high school.

290
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:49,510
<11-12,Amy>也不是完全一样啦
<11-12,Amy>Well, it's not exactly like it.

291
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:51,850
<11-12,Amy>我们都是智商超群的人
<11-12,Amy>We're all extremely smart.

292
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:56,390
<11-13,Penny>你这种受欢迎的妹子嘴还真毒
<11-13,Penny>Wow... you popular girls are mean.

293
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,530
<12-1,Leonard>我要去煮点咖啡了  你要喝吗
<12-1,Leonard>I'm gonna get some coffee. You want some?

294
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:04,350
<12-2,Sheldon>人家正在努力将生活拉回正轨中
<12-2,Sheldon>Uh, you're really going to have caffeine in front of me

295
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,550
<12-2,Sheldon>你却要在我面前摄入咖啡因吗
<12-2,Sheldon>when I'm trying to get my life back on track?

296
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:10,950
<12-3,Leonard>好了  我们假设你的确有咖啡因上瘾的问题
<12-3,Leonard>Uh, okay, let's pretend you do have a problem.

297
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:11,860
<12-4,Sheldon>-的确有  -才没有
<12-4,Sheldon>- I do. - You don't.

298
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,530
<12-6,Sheldon>-我真有问题  -你才没有问题
<12-6,Sheldon>- Yeah, but I do. - No, you don't!

299
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,940
<12-7,Leonard>让我们假设你有问题
<12-7,Leonard>But let's say you do.

300
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,900
<12-7,Leonard>不要说你有  因为你没有
<12-7,Leonard>And don't say you do, because you don't!

301
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,930
<12-7,Leonard>如果真是这样  那么全身心地投入工作
<12-7,Leonard>Now, wouldn't you think that throwing yourself

302
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:24,740
<12-7,Leonard>难道不是解决上瘾问题的最好方式吗
<12-7,Leonard>into your work would be the best way to deal with it?

303
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,900
<12-9,Leonard>-解决什么  -你的问题
<12-9,Leonard>- With what? - Your problem.

304
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,020
<12-10,Sheldon>你不是说我没有问题吗
<12-10,Sheldon>I thought I didn't have a problem.

305
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:35,560
<12-11,Howard>真是惨得不忍直视啊
<12-11,Howard>That was painful to watch.

306
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,090
<13-1,Raj>我们这是要去哪儿啊
<13-1,Raj>So where are we going?

307
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:42,130
<13-2,Bernadette>我不知道
<13-2,Bernadette>I don't know.

308
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,810
<13-2,Bernadette>好吧
<13-2,Bernadette>Okay.

309
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:46,480
<13-3,Raj>好一对末路狂花
<13-3,Raj>How Thelma and Louise of us.

311
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:50,500
<13-4,Bernadette>拉杰  你说我为什么不上心呢
<13-4,Bernadette>Raj, why don't I care about anything?

312
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,590
<13-5,Raj>你说什么
<13-5,Raj>I'm sorry?

313
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,510
<13-6,Bernadette>这明明是我的孩子
<13-6,Bernadette>It's my baby.

314
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:55,740
<13-6,Bernadette>我应该会在意婴儿房  颜色之类的事
<13-6,Bernadette>I-I should care about nurseries and colors,

315
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:58,340
<13-6,Bernadette>但我却毫不关心  我到底有什么毛病
<13-6,Bernadette>and I don't-- what's wrong with me?

316
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:02,740
<13-7,Raj>很可能和你摇篮边的罪案现场照片有关
<13-7,Raj>Well, crime-scene photos near your crib spring to mind.

317
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:04,670
<13-8,Bernadette>我一直在等着自己能兴奋起来
<13-8,Bernadette>I keep waiting to feel excited,

318
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,570
<13-8,Bernadette>可那种感觉迟迟没有降临
<13-8,Bernadette>but it's not happening.

319
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,390
<13-8,Bernadette>如果我一直感觉不到兴奋怎么办
<13-8,Bernadette>What if it never happens?

320
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,450
<13-9,Raj>博纳黛特  别这样
<13-9,Raj>Bernadette, come on, look,

321
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,890
<13-9,Raj>你想太多了
<13-9,Raj>you're overthinking this, okay?

322
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:15,840
<13-9,Raj>你会成为一位很棒的妈妈的
<13-9,Raj>You're gonna be an amazing mom.

323
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,080
<13-9,Raj>就算你自己不相信
<13-9,Raj>Even if you don't believe it,

324
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,790
<13-9,Raj>我知道你具有母性本能
<13-9,Raj>I know you have maternal instincts.

325
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:22,220
<13-10,Bernadette>有一次  我负责照顾我弟弟们
<13-10,Bernadette>Once, I was supposed to babysit my brothers.

326
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:25,730
<13-10,Bernadette>结果邻居发现他们光着屁股在后院捉蟋蟀吃
<13-10,Bernadette>Our neighbor found them naked in the backyard eating crickets.

327
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:28,860
<13-11,Raj>玩得开心  吃得满意
<13-11,Raj>Happy and well-fed.

328
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,480
<13-11,Raj>你看  我从你的故事里听出了这两优点
<13-11,Raj>You see, that's what I'm taking from that story.

329
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:38,060
<14-1,Sheldon>莱纳德  我能问你个问题吗
<14-1,Sheldon>Leonard, can I ask you a question?

330
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,760
<14-2,Leonard>是有关你应该解决的轴对称问题
<14-2,Leonard>Is it about the rotational symmetries you should be figuring out

331
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,060
<14-2,Leonard>还是你假装的咖啡因上瘾问题
<14-2,Leonard>or your fake caffeine problem?

332
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,140
<14-3,Sheldon>霍华德  我能问你个问题吗
<14-3,Sheldon>Howard, can I ask you a question?

333
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:48,520
<14-4,Howard>不行
<14-4,Howard>No.

334
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:52,090
<14-5,Sheldon>就当我对着空气说话吧
<14-5,Sheldon>All right, I'll just toss this out to the room.

335
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:54,260
<14-5,Sheldon>我在想对抗瘾头的最好办法
<14-5,Sheldon>Um, I was thinking that the best way

336
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:57,860
<14-5,Sheldon>应该是一步一步脱瘾
<14-5,Sheldon>to fight my addiction is by weaning myself off in steps.

337
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:00,310
<14-5,Sheldon>我找不到戒咖啡因贴片
<14-5,Sheldon>Now, I couldn't find a caffeine patch,

338
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:02,450
<14-5,Sheldon>但我找到了一个号称
<14-5,Sheldon>but I did find what claims to be

339
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:05,960
<14-5,Sheldon>能震荡五脏六腑的咖啡因栓剂
<14-5,Sheldon>a mind-boosting caffeine suppository.

340
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,270
<14-5,Sheldon>没错
<14-5,Sheldon>Yeah.

341
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:09,630
<14-5,Sheldon>讲一个关于直肠的有趣知识...
<14-5,Sheldon>You know, the interesting fact about the rectum...

342
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:11,030
<14-5,Sheldon>谢尔顿
<14-5,Sheldon>Sheldon!

343
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:15,020
<14-6,Leonard>我们有着难以达成的截止日期
<14-6,Leonard>We are dealing with an impossible deadline

344
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,600
<14-6,Leonard>而且还是拜你所赐
<14-6,Leonard>from the Air Force because of you.

345
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,440
<14-6,Leonard>所以喝功能饮料  不喝功能饮料
<14-6,Leonard>So have an energy drink, don't have an energy drink.

346
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,320
<14-6,Leonard>买肛门栓剂  你爱塞哪就塞哪
<14-6,Leonard>Order suppositories and shove 'em wherever you want,

347
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,690
<14-6,Leonard>我才懒得管你
<14-6,Leonard>I don't care!

348
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,090
<14-7,Sheldon>不用塞
<14-7,Sheldon>You don't shove them.

349
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:29,260
<14-7,Sheldon>它自带润滑导入器
<14-7,Sheldon>They come with an easy-glide applicator.

350
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:33,200
<14-8,Leonard>好的  听我说
<14-8,Leonard>Right. Listen to me.

351
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,470
<14-8,Leonard>你不做好你那部分  我们什么都做不了
<14-8,Leonard>We can't do anything until you do your part.

352
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:38,420
<14-8,Leonard>所以赶快到白板跟前  做你该做的事
<14-8,Leonard>So get up in front of this whiteboard and do it!

353
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,320
<14-10,Leonard>-我做不到  -当然能做
<14-10,Leonard>- I can't. - Yes, you can.

354
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,300
<14-10,Leonard>不是
<14-10,Leonard>No...

355
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:44,400
<14-11,Sheldon>我算不出来
<14-11,Sheldon>I can't figure out the math.

356
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,410
<14-11,Sheldon>这几天我绞尽脑汁
<14-11,Sheldon>I've been racking my brain for days,

357
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:48,520
<14-11,Sheldon>还是一无所获
<14-11,Sheldon>and I've got nothing.

358
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:51,010
<14-12,Leonard>真的吗
<14-12,Leonard>Seriously?

359
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:52,350
<14-13,Sheldon>我做不到
<14-13,Sheldon>I can't do it.

360
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:54,760
<14-13,Sheldon>我并没有我以为的那么聪明
<14-13,Sheldon>I'm not as smart as I think I am.

361
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:58,340
<14-13,Sheldon>对不起  都是我的错
<14-13,Sheldon>I'm so sorry. This is all my fault.

362

<15-10,Dr Koothrapalli>心里觉得有些怪怪的
<15-10,Dr Koothrapalli>Something's wrong.

<15-11,Bernadette>不像其他妈妈那么痴迷

<15-11,Bernadette>说实话  我都不确定自己是否喜欢孩子
<15-11,Bernadette>Honestly, I'm not even sure I like babies.

409
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:04,740
<15-12,Dr Koothrapalli>但这不代表你不爱自己的孩子啊
<15-12,Dr Koothrapalli>It doesn't mean you won't love your own baby.

410
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:07,510
<15-13,Bernadette>我以为自己会更兴奋呢
<15-13,Bernadette>But I thought I'd be more excited.

411
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,790
<15-14,Dr Koothrapalli>兴奋也不能保证什么啊
<15-14,Dr Koothrapalli>Oh, being excited isn't a guarantee of anything.

<15-14,Dr Koothrapalli>他出生以后  一举一动都让她痴迷不已
<15-14,Dr Koothrapalli>After he was born, she doted on his every move.

<15-14,Dr Koothrapalli>他伤了妈妈的心  搬到地球另一端去
<15-14,Dr Koothrapalli>He broke her heart, moved halfway around the world,

416
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:23,370
<15-14,Dr Koothrapalli>只跟穷酸的可怜白人姑娘约会
<15-14,Dr Koothrapalli>and dates only poor white women.

<16-1,Leonard>我不知道该怎么开口
<16-1,Leonard>Uh...I don't know how to say this.

422
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:49,400
<16-2,Colonel Williams>可以试试用"长官"开头
<16-2,Colonel Williams>Well, you could try starting with "sir".

423
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,160
<16-3,Leonard>对  对不起  长官
