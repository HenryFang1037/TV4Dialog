1
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:04,940
<1-1,Raj>这周末你想不想
<1-1,Raj>Hey, want to spend some time

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:06,680
<1-1,Raj>一起玩星球大战的新游戏
<1-1,Raj>playing the new Star Wars game this weekend?

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:07,530
<1-2,Leonard>我说不准
<1-2,Leonard>Oh, I don't know.

4
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:09,960
<1-2,Leonard>我答应过自己要远离电脑
<1-2,Leonard>I kind of promised myself I'd get off the computer,

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,750
<1-2,Leonard>多点锻炼身体  多做些运动...
<1-2,Leonard>be more physically active. Get some exercise...

6
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:15,170
<1-3,Howard>你马上要爬三层楼梯了
<1-3,Howard>You're about to walk up three flights of stairs.

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:18,990
<1-4,Leonard>说得好  算我一个
<1-4,Leonard>Good point, I'm in.

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,330
<1-5,Raj>我有个更好的主意
<1-5,Raj>You know what would be great?

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,040
<1-5,Raj>咱们像以前那样玩一把
<1-5,Raj>Let's do it like the old days.

10
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,900
<1-6,Leonard>你是说游戏马拉松吗
<1-6,Leonard>You mean, are you talking gaming marathon?

11
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,720
<1-7,Raj>没错  从周六早上开始
<1-7,Raj>Yeah. Start Saturday morning,

12
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,080
<1-7,Raj>连玩四十八个小时
<1-7,Raj>go 48 hours,

13
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,010
<1-7,Raj>带上睡袋  垃圾食品
<1-7,Raj>sleeping bags, junk food...

14
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:33,950
<1-8,Howard>关掉手机  避免老妈骚扰
<1-8,Howard>Turn off our phones so our moms can't call.

15
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:38,190
<1-9,Leonard>就像几年前咱们玩魔兽世界那样
<1-9,Leonard>It would be like our World Of Warcraft a few years ago

16
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:40,490
<1-9,Leonard>最后邻居都报警了
<1-9,Leonard>when the neighbors called the cops on us.

17
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,040
<1-10,Howard>他们打电话报警是因为受不了恶臭
<1-10,Howard>They called the cops because of the smell.

18
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,640
<1-10,Howard>人家还以为咱们死翘翘了呢
<1-10,Howard>They thought we were dead.

19
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,910
<1-11,Raj>那时的我们真是坏小子呀
<1-11,Raj>We were badass back in the day.

20
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:53,420
<1-12,Leonard>好吧  就这么定了
<1-12,Leonard>All right, let's do it.

22
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,510
<1-13,Howard>星球大战  四十八小时不停战
<1-13,Howard>48 hours of Star Wars gaming.

24
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:57,800
<1-14,Raj>开战吧  就像在奥德兰战区那样
<1-14,Raj>It's on like Alderaan.

25
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:01,740
<1-15,Leonard>谢尔顿  取消你周末的行程
<1-15,Leonard>Hey, Sheldon, clear your weekend.

26
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:04,530
<1-15,Leonard>星球大战马拉松  周六上午正式开始
<1-15,Leonard>Starting Saturday morning, Star Wars marathon.

27
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,160
<1-16,Raj>是看电影还是打电动
<1-16,Raj>Movies or video games?

28
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,060
<1-17,Sheldon>不  是桌游吗
<1-17,Sheldon>No, board game?

29
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,300
<1-17,Sheldon>还是集换式卡牌游戏
<1-17,Sheldon>Or trading card games?

30
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,860
<1-17,Sheldon>或是乐高  或是角色扮演
<1-17,Sheldon>Or Lego's? Or dress up?

31
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:10,800
<1-17,Sheldon>又或是看漫画书
<1-17,Sheldon>Or comic books?!

32
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:12,710
<1-17,Sheldon>难道是绘声绘色地朗读电影小说吗
<1-17,Sheldon>Or dramatic readings of Novelizations?!

33
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:14,200
<1-17,Sheldon>我都参加
<1-17,Sheldon>Yes to all!

34
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,700
<1-18,Leonard>我们准备玩网游
<1-18,Leonard>We are going to play the online game.

35
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,370
<1-19,Sheldon>网游
<1-19,Sheldon>The online game?!

36
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:21,520
<1-19,Sheldon>更妙
<1-19,Sheldon>Bully!

37
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,040
<1-20,Amy>先生们  虽然谢尔顿肯定非常喜欢
<1-20,Amy>Gentlemen, as much as I'm sure Sheldon would enjoy

38
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:26,730
<1-20,Amy>跟你们一起玩星际间的虚拟游戏
<1-20,Amy>playing intergalactic make-believe,

39
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:27,970
<1-20,Amy>但我们俩已经另有安排了
<1-20,Amy>he and I have other plans.

40
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:31,090
<1-20,Amy>我们要去参加弗罗拉姨妈的九十三岁生日派对
<1-20,Amy>We are attending my Aunt Flora's 93rd birthday party.

41
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,510
<1-21,Sheldon>你就跟她说我有事去不了了嘛
<1-21,Sheldon>Just tell her I can't come.

42
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:35,920
<1-22,Amy>如果我们不去  她会很失望的
<1-22,Amy>She'll be disappointed if we don't show up.

43
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,220
<1-23,Sheldon>她都九十三岁了
<1-23,Sheldon>She's 93.

44
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,480
<1-23,Sheldon>也失望不了几年了
<1-23,Sheldon>She won't be disappointed for very long.

45
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,580
<1-24,Amy>不  你等会  我可是遵守了
<1-24,Amy>No, hang on. I followed all the protocols

46
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,850
<1-24,Amy>恋爱协议里你制定的所有规定
<1-24,Amy>set forth by you in the relationship agreement.

47
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:48,940
<1-24,Amy>我提前七十二个小时提交了书面申请
<1-24,Amy>I made a written record request 72 hours in advance.

48
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:51,900
<1-24,Amy>我检查了车的胎压
<1-24,Amy>I checked the tire pressure on the car.

49
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,590
<1-24,Amy>我甚至还联系了疾病控制中心  问他们
<1-24,Amy>I even contacted the Centers For Disease Control to find out

50
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:57,360
<1-24,Amy>去橘子郡旅游要打什么疫苗
<1-24,Amy>what shots they recommend for travel to Orange County.

51
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,840
<1-24,Amy>顺便说一声  什么疫苗都不用打
<1-24,Amy>FYI, it's none.

52
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:04,600
<1-25,Sheldon>艾米  恋爱协议制订的初衷可不是为了
<1-25,Sheldon>Amy, the relationship agreement was not designed

53
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,850
<1-25,Sheldon>给咱俩任何一方行方便
<1-25,Sheldon>for either one of us to get our way.

54
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,740
<1-26,Amy>你就拿它来给自己行方便了呀
<1-26,Amy>You use it to get your way.

55
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,960
<1-27,Sheldon>我是拿它来做该做的事
<1-27,Sheldon>I use it to get the right way.

56
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,490
<1-27,Sheldon>事实证明  该做的事就是给我自己行方便
<1-27,Sheldon>The fact that the right way is also my way

57
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:16,240
<1-27,Sheldon>这真是个美妙的巧合
<1-27,Sheldon>is a happy coincidence.

58
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,500
<1-28,Amy>你都答应我了
<1-28,Amy>You gave me your word.

59
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,020
<1-28,Amy>你就要跟我去
<1-28,Amy>You're coming with me.

60
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,530
<1-29,Leonard>我们会想你的  谢尔顿
<1-29,Leonard>We'll miss you, Sheldon.

61
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:22,900
<1-30,Sheldon>好吧
<1-30,Sheldon>Yeah, well,

62
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,400
<1-30,Sheldon>谁会想把整个周末浪费
<1-30,Sheldon>who wants to spend the whole weekend,

63
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,950
<1-30,Sheldon>在一堆假想星球上跑来跑去
<1-30,Sheldon>running around a bunch of pretend planets

64
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,490
<1-30,Sheldon>跟不存在的怪兽打来打去呀
<1-30,Sheldon>battling made up monsters.

65
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:29,140
<1-30,Sheldon>小孩才这样呢
<1-30,Sheldon>That's for babies.

66
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,480
<1-31,Howard>话是没错  可这游戏有光剑呢
<1-31,Howard>Yeah, but it's got lightsabers.

67
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:34,380
<1-32,Sheldon>求求你了  艾米  这个游戏有光剑呢
<1-32,Sheldon>Yeah, please, Amy! It's got lightsabers!

77
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:02,500
<2-1,Sheldon>你好  斯图尔特
<2-1,Sheldon>Hello, Stewart.

78
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,590
<2-2,Stuart>你好  谢尔顿
<2-2,Stuart>Hey, Sheldon.

79
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:04,760
<2-2,Stuart>有什么需要帮忙的吗
<2-2,Stuart>Help you with anything?

80
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,420
<2-3,Sheldon>有  我这周末要去参加一个
<2-3,Sheldon>Yes, I'm attending a party this weekend

81
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,630
<2-3,Sheldon>九十三岁老太太的生日派对
<2-3,Sheldon>for a 93-year-old woman.

82
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,530
<2-3,Sheldon>你能推荐份礼物吗
<2-3,Sheldon>Can you recommend a gift?

83
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,120
<2-4,Stuart>我也不知道
<2-4,Stuart>Uh, I don't know.

84
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,460
<2-4,Stuart>在亚瑟王神剑的末端弄个网球
<2-4,Stuart>Could put a tennis ball on the end of Excalibur.

85
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:21,010
<2-4,Stuart>一根酷到爆的拐杖就诞生了
<2-4,Stuart>Make a pretty badass cane.

86
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,080
<2-5,Sheldon>-那你这卖网球吗  -不卖
<2-5,Sheldon>- Do you supply the tennis ball?  - No.

87
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,260
<2-7,Sheldon>那算了
<2-7,Sheldon>Then no.

88
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:28,340
<2-7,Sheldon>还有什么
<2-7,Sheldon>What else?

89
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:33,390
<2-8,Stuart>珍藏版的蝙蝠侠多功能腰带
<2-8,Stuart>Oh, have this collectors edition batman utility belt.

90
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:37,090
<2-8,Stuart>也许她可以把这个系在身上当药罐
<2-8,Stuart>Maybe she can use it as a wearable pill caddy.

91
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:40,540
<2-9,Sheldon>她要是不穿一整套的话
<2-9,Sheldon>Well, she'd just look silly wearing that

92
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,700
<2-9,Sheldon>光系腰带会显得很傻
<2-9,Sheldon>without the rest of the costume.

93
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:47,360
<2-10,Stuart>抱歉  谢尔顿  没了  我江郎才尽了
<2-10,Stuart>I'm sorry Sheldon, that's it. That's all I got.

94
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:48,700
<2-11,Sheldon>这不是你的错
<2-11,Sheldon>Oh, it's not your fault.

95
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,290
<2-11,Sheldon>我已经去过模型火车店
<2-11,Sheldon>I've been to the model train store.

96
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:51,730
<2-11,Sheldon>无线电商店
<2-11,Sheldon>I've been to Radio Shack.

97
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:54,250
<2-11,Sheldon>这老太太的礼物可真难买
<2-11,Sheldon>This woman is impossible to shop for.

98
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:57,280
<2-12,Leonard>要不是谢尔顿搞得到女人太让我震惊
<2-12,Leonard>I'd make fun of Sheldon for having girl problems

99
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,040
<2-12,Leonard>我早就开始取笑他连女人都搞不定了
<2-12,Leonard>if I wasn't in shock that Sheldon has girl problems.

100
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:03,790
<2-13,Sheldon>没事  莱纳德  你尽管取笑我吧
<2-13,Sheldon>No, Leonard, go ahead and mock.

101
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:05,280
<2-13,Sheldon>就像我父亲常说的
<2-13,Sheldon>Like my daddy always said,

102
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,690
<2-13,Sheldon>"谢利  唯女子与小人难养也"
<2-13,Sheldon>"Shelly, women aren't anything but flippin' pains in the bottom."

103
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,890
<2-14,Leonard>你父亲是这么说话的吗
<2-14,Leonard>That's what your father used to say?

104
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:16,380
<2-15,Sheldon>我自动把脏话和语助词去掉
<2-15,Sheldon>Well, I took out the bad words and the yeehaw,

105
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,970
<2-15,Sheldon>但大意不变
<2-15,Sheldon>but you get the gist.

106
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,660
<2-16,Howard>如果你不想去参加派对的话  就别去
<2-16,Howard>Look, if you don't want to go to the party, just don't go.

107
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,080
<2-16,Howard>你是个成年人
<2-16,Howard>You're a grown man.

108
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,360
<2-16,Howard>就得有成年人的样子
<2-16,Howard>Act like one.

109
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,430
<2-16,Howard>跟艾米说  你想这周末不回家
<2-16,Howard>Tell Amy you want to spend the weekend having a sleepover

110
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:28,710
<2-16,Howard>跟你的朋友们一起玩游戏
<2-16,Howard>and playing video games with your friends.

111
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:31,600
<2-16,Howard>没准她还会喜欢你这样呢
<2-16,Howard>Maybe she'll dig it.

112
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,270
<2-16,Howard>女人就喜欢立场坚定的男人[直译为坚定的掌舵手]
<2-16,Howard>Women like a firm hand on the tiller.

113
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,510
<2-17,Raj>我连舵[阴蒂]在哪都找不到
<2-17,Raj>I can never find the tiller.

114
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:41,660
<2-17,Raj>我还有本教学书呢  还是于事无补
<2-17,Raj>I got a book; it didn't help.

115
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:45,460
<2-18,Sheldon>是啊  我以前总是想如果朝一日我沦为奴隶
<2-18,Sheldon>Yeah, I always thought if I were ever enslaved,

116
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:49,040
<2-18,Sheldon>那肯定是被另一个星球的高级物种奴役
<2-18,Sheldon>it would be by an advanced species from another planet,

117
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,530
<2-18,Sheldon>而不是某个来自格兰岱尔市的小妞
<2-18,Sheldon>not some hotsy-totsy from Glendale.

118
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,800
<2-19,Howard>我下载了一个应用程序
<2-19,Howard>Now, I downloaded an app that

119
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,000
<2-19,Howard>没准对现在的情况会有帮助哦
<2-19,Howard>might be helpful in this situation.

120
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,460
<2-19,Howard>你说得没错
<2-19,Howard>You're right.

121
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,710
<2-20,Sheldon>我这么聪明
<2-20,Sheldon>I'm smart as a whip.

123
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:07,180
<2-20,Sheldon>肯定能找到解决办法的
<2-20,Sheldon>I should be able to figure this out.

124
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,700
<3-1,Leonard>话说我这周末
<3-1,Leonard>Hey, listen, I kind of made plans

125
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,870
<3-1,Leonard>打算跟他们几个玩  不过后来我想
<3-1,Leonard>with the guys this weekend, but then I wondered,

126
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,950
<3-1,Leonard>我们正处在恋爱测试阶段
<3-1,Leonard>because we're in this relationship-beta-test,

127
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,310
<3-1,Leonard>我是不是应该先问问你的意见
<3-1,Leonard>if I should have asked you first.

128
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:21,980
<3-1,Leonard>接着我又想  如果我真的先问你
<3-1,Leonard>Then I thought if I did check with you first,

129
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:24,920
<3-1,Leonard>你又可能觉得我对这段感情太认真了
<3-1,Leonard>then you'd think that I was taking things to seriously.

130
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,230
<3-1,Leonard>再后来  我就流鼻血了
<3-1,Leonard>And then-en I got a nosebleed.

131
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,740
<3-2,Penny>你不用事事都先问我
<3-2,Penny>You don't have to check with me.

132
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,220
<3-2,Penny>你想干什么就干什么
<3-2,Penny>Do whatever you want.

133
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:36,840
<3-3,Leonard>这不是我期待的反应  不过没关系
<3-3,Leonard>I guess I was hoping for a different reaction, but okay.

134
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:38,880
<3-4,Penny>是吗  那你期待的是什么反应
<3-4,Penny>Really, what were you hoping for?

135
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,900
<3-4,Penny>我也不知道
<3-4,Penny>I don't know,

136
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,290
<3-5,Leonard>或许你会小小地生气一下
<3-5,Leonard>maybe that you'd be a little upset,

137
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:43,790
<3-5,Leonard>然后意识到
<3-5,Leonard>and then you'd realize that

138
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:46,300
<3-5,Leonard>我是一匹向往自由的骏马
<3-5,Leonard>I'm a stallion that has to run free.

139
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,320
<3-5,Leonard>这点会让你小小地性奋一下
<3-5,Leonard>And that would turn you on a little.

140
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,610
<3-6,Penny>行  我是个演员  再问我一遍
<3-6,Penny>Okay, I'm an actress. Ask me again.

00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:07,940
<3-8,Penny>当初爱上你时我就知道了
<3-8,Penny>I knew what I was getting into.

00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:46,620
<3-24,Penny>昨天  你要我帮你看看

189
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,800
<3-24,Penny>你耳朵里是不是有瓢虫
<3-24,Penny>to see if there was a ladybug in it.

190
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,430
<3-25,Sheldon>我上一次叫你帮我做非紧急医疗的事
<3-25,Sheldon>When is the last time I asked you to do something

191
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,330
<3-25,Sheldon>是什么时候
<3-25,Sheldon>that wasn't a medical emergency?

192
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:54,680
<3-24,Penny>昨天  你要我帮你看看
<3-24,Penny>Yesterday. You made me look in your ear

193
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:56,890
<3-24,Penny>你耳朵里是不是有瓢虫
<3-24,Penny>to see if there was a ladybug in it.

194
00:07:58,370 --> 00:07:59,570
<3-27,Sheldon>好吧  我别无选择
<3-27,Sheldon>All right, then, I have no choice

195
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:01,270
<3-27,Sheldon>只有执行B计划了
<3-27,Sheldon>but to go on to plan B.

198
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,940
<3-29,Sheldon>去外面跑一圈  看看能不能感冒
<3-29,Sheldon>with a wet head and try to catch a cold.

<4-1,Amy>早上好

<4-2,Sheldon>早上好
<4-2,Sheldon>Hello.

201
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:14,740
<4-3,Amy>我觉得你今天会玩得很开心的
<4-3,Amy>I think you're really going to enjoy yourself today.

202
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:16,630
<4-3,Amy>你不但能见到我的亲戚
<4-3,Amy>Not only do you get to meet my relatives,

203
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,860
<4-3,Amy>而且因为我姨妈的派对是疗养院承办的
<4-3,Amy>but since my aunt's nursing home is catering the party,

204
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,430
<4-3,Amy>所以所有的食品都软绵绵的
<4-3,Amy>all of the food is incredibly soft.

205
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:22,310
<4-3,Amy>就像给你的牙齿放假一样
<4-3,Amy>It's like a vacation for your teeth.

206
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,000
<4-4,Sheldon>好的
<4-4,Sheldon>All right.

207
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,880
<4-5,Amy>你确定你想去吗
<4-5,Amy>You sure you're okay with this?

208
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,030
<4-5,Amy>确定
<4-5,Amy>Yes.

209
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:30,740
<4-6,Sheldon>我决定找一个
<4-6,Sheldon>I decided to find a way

210
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:34,440
<4-6,Sheldon>即能出席派对又能玩得开心的方法
<4-6,Sheldon>that I could have this experience and enjoy it.

211
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,660
<4-7,Amy>谢谢  这对我来说意义重大
<4-7,Amy>Thank you. That means a lot to me.

212
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:38,010
<4-8,Sheldon>不用谢我
<4-8,Sheldon>Oh, don't thank me.

213
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:39,820
<4-8,Sheldon>要谢就谢无线技术
<4-8,Sheldon>Thank wireless technology.

214
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,970
<4-8,Sheldon>我发现即使出席你姨妈的无聊派对
<4-8,Sheldon>I realized, I can go to your aunt's awful party

215
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:46,660
<4-8,Sheldon>也一样能跟朋友们玩网游一整天
<4-8,Sheldon>and still spend the whole day gaming with my friends.

216
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,610
<4-9,Amy>谢尔顿  我的亲戚都想跟你聊聊
<4-9,Amy>Sheldon, my relatives are going to want to talk to you,

217
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:52,760
<4-9,Amy>而你却打算坐在一旁玩游戏吗
<4-9,Amy>and you're going to be sitting there playing a game?

218
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,520
<4-9,Amy>这未免太无礼了吧
<4-9,Amy>Isn't that a little rude?

219
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:56,510
<4-10,Sheldon>你放心  我有办法
<4-10,Sheldon>Oh, I got that covered.

220

<4-10,Sheldon>耳麦
<4-10,Sheldon>Headset.

221
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,670
<4-10,Sheldon>那些老家伙在说什么  我一个字都听不到
<4-10,Sheldon>I won't hear a word the old geezers are saying.

222
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,320
<4-11,Amy>既然你觉得玩游戏比
<4-11,Amy>You know, if playing that game is more important to you

223
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,550
<4-11,Amy>履行你对我的承诺还重要
<4-11,Amy>than honoring your commitment to me,

224
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:10,130
<4-11,Amy>你也不介意我告诉大家我要带男友出席
<4-11,Amy>and you don't mind me showing up at a party all by myself

225
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:12,340
<4-11,Amy>结果却孤家寡人现身在派对上的话
<4-11,Amy>after I've already told everybody I'll be bringing somebody,

226
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,940
<4-11,Amy>那我没话说
<4-11,Amy>then, fine.

227
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,580
<4-11,Amy>你回家去玩游戏吧
<4-11,Amy>Go home and play your game.

<4-12,Sheldon>I wouldn't mind a piece of birthday cake,

231
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:28,840
<4-12,Sheldon>前提是老家伙吹蜡烛时口水没飙出来
<4-12,Sheldon>provided the old gal's candle blow is clean and dry.

232
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:38,390
<5-1,Raj>东西齐了

00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,310
<5-5,Leonard>还从不用球棒打她们

251
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,800
<5-6,Sheldon>是妓女啊
<5-6,Sheldon>Those women are prostitutes?

<5-6,Sheldon>你说她们是在为干细胞研究募资
<5-6,Sheldon>You said they were raising money for stem cell research.

255
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,400
<5-8,Leonard>我觉得拉杰已经捷足先登了
<5-8,Leonard>I think Raj beat you to it.

256
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,480
<5-9,Howard>不是  伯纳黛特要跟我们一起玩
<5-9,Howard>No. Bernadette's going to be playing with us.

<5-9,Howard>很不错吧  对吧  那是当然
<5-9,Howard>So, that's pretty cool, huh? Right? Sure it is, yeah.

<5-11,Howard>我也没办法  昨晚她说
<5-11,Howard>I had no choice. Last night, she said,

<5-11,Howard>我们明天一起吃早午餐吧
<5-11,Howard>"Why don't we go out for brunch tomorrow

<5-11,Howard>然后再去植物园
<5-11,Howard>and then maybe the Arboretum."

263
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,820
<5-11,Howard>我说  不行
<5-11,Howard>And I said, "Well, no,

264
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,880
<5-11,Howard>我答应他们几个
<5-11,Howard>I promised the guys I was going to

265
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,240
<5-11,Howard>周末一起玩游戏的
<5-11,Howard>play a video game with them all weekend."

266
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,470
<5-11,Howard>然后她说  听起来挺好玩的
<5-11,Howard>And she said, "That sounds like fun.

267
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:58,180
<5-11,Howard>我能加入吗
<5-11,Howard>Can I come, too?"

268
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:00,230
<5-11,Howard>我沉默了一会儿  然后她说
<5-11,Howard>And then I didn't answer for a second, and then she said,

269
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:01,550
<5-11,Howard>你是不想让我一起吗
<5-11,Howard>"Well, do you not want me to come?"

270
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:03,110
<5-11,Howard>然后我就给她买了个新笔记本和一套游戏
<5-11,Howard>And then I bought her a new laptop and the game,

271
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:04,930
<5-11,Howard>然后她现在正在停车呢
<5-11,Howard>and she's parking the car right now.

272
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,910
<5-12,Sheldon>鞭子抽男人的程序

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,040
<5-13,Leonard>可以  但我觉得你等得有点久
<5-13,Leonard>Uh, it is, but I think you might've waited too long

275
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,740
<5-13,Leonard>笑点都过去了
<5-13,Leonard>for it to be funny.

276
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:21,960
<5-13,Leonard>我说错了  还是很搞笑
<5-13,Leonard>I was wrong; it's still funny.

285
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,480
<6-4,Amy>"是真有其人  还是你编出来的呀"
<6-4,Amy>"Is he real, or did you make him up like Armen,

286
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,340
<6-5,Penny>比如之前那个小马农阿曼"
<6-5,Penny>the miniature horse breeder?"

00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,980
<6-5,Penny>谁是小马农阿曼

<6-6,Amy>The pretend boyfriend I invented to get my family off my back.

289
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:59,370
<6-6,Amy>但很快就被揭穿了  因为我答不上来
<6-6,Amy>It unraveled quickly when I couldn't answer the question

00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:00,910
<6-6,Amy>"你俩怎么认识的"

348
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,330
<8-5,Amy>到了某种程度  你就会开始玩花样
<8-5,Amy>At a certain point, you start doing trick shots

349
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:53,030
<8-5,Amy>好让这游戏不那么枯燥
<8-5,Amy>just to keep things interesting.

356
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:10,120
<8-10,Penny>把这俩搞错的话  他们会大发雷霆的
<8-10,Penny>They get all cranky when you mix the two up.

357
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,240
<8-11,Amy>有什么区别吗
<8-11,Amy>What's the difference?

358
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,650
<8-12,Penny>绝对没区别
<8-12,Penny>There's absolutely no difference.

359
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,400
<8-13,Amy>怎样才能让他对我更好呢
<8-13,Amy>How do I get him to treat me better?

<8-14,Penny>Let me give you a little girlfriend 101.

362
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,490
<8-14,Penny>通常使出的第一招
<8-14,Penny>Usually the first move out of the gate

363
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:25,420
<8-14,Penny>不跟他滚床单
<8-14,Penny>is you withhold sex,

364
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:28,500
<8-14,Penny>但这招得等谢尔顿到青春期后才有用
<8-14,Penny>but that will work better after Sheldon hits puberty.

365
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:31,770
<8-14,Penny>所以  我认为
<8-14,Penny>So, I'd say...

366
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:33,690
<8-14,Penny>对他采取不予理睬政策
<8-14,Penny>give him the silent treatment.

367
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:36,020
<8-15,Amy>不行  他爱死这样了
<8-15,Amy>No, he loves that.

368
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:37,600
<8-17,Amy>我们俩共处一个房间
<8-17,Amy>Our record for sitting in a room together

369
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,410
<8-17,Amy>但互相不讲话的记录是六个半小时
<8-17,Amy>and not speaking to each other is six-and-a half hours.

370
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:42,280
<8-17,Amy>他还说那晚他过得很开心
<8-17,Amy>He said it was a magical evening.

371
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,000
<8-18,Penny>好吧  那我们就只能采取
<8-18,Penny>All right, then we're gonna have to go

372
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,340
<8-18,Penny>最古老也最有效的那招了
<8-18,Penny>with an oldie but goodie;

373
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:48,000
<8-18,Penny>大吵大闹
<8-18,Penny>making a scene.

374
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,490
<8-19,Amy>这个我可不大擅长
<8-19,Amy>I don't think I'd be good at that.

375
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,840
<8-20,Penny>所以说有我这闺蜜你幸运死了
<8-20,Penny>That's why you're lucky to have me.

376
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,520
<8-20,Penny>在我家乡奥马哈  有餐厅不允许我进去
<8-20,Penny>Back in Omaha, there are two different restaurants

377
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,200
<8-20,Penny>就是红辣椒饭店  我还被黑名单了两次
<8-20,Penny>I'm not allowed into. Both Chili's.

378
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:02,080
<9-1,Raj>伯纳黛特  记住你是我们团的补血师
<9-1,Raj>Bernadette, remember, your character's the healer in our group.

379
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,010
<9-1,Raj>你不能只给霍华德回血  要给大家回啊
<9-1,Raj>You're in charge of healing all of us, not just Howard.

380
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:06,370
<9-2,Bernadette>我情不自禁嘛
<9-2,Bernadette>I can't help it.

381
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:08,920
<9-2,Bernadette>我的华仔小巫师受伤了呢
<9-2,Bernadette>My Howie Wowie has an owie.

382
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,980
<9-3,Sheldon>这真是我所听过的
<9-3,Sheldon>That is the most sickeningly sweet thing

383
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:15,310
<9-3,Sheldon>最恶心的甜言蜜语
<9-3,Sheldon>I have ever experienced.

384
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:18,390
<9-3,Sheldon>我正用"蜡烛糖"吸"酷A果汁"呢
<9-3,Sheldon>And I am sipping Kool-Aid through a Red Vine.

385
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:24,120
<9-4,Amy (bursting in)>谢尔顿·库珀  我有帐要跟你算
<9-4,Amy (bursting in)>Sheldon Cooper, I've got a bone to pick with you,

386
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,950
<9-4,Amy (bursting in)>我要当着你所有朋友的面算这笔帐
<9-4,Amy (bursting in)>and I'm about to do it in front of all your friends.

387
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:28,560
<9-5,Penny>没错  跟他好好算账  算得他裤衩都保不住
<9-5,Penny>Yeah, you pick that bone. You pick that bone clean!

388
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:31,060
<9-6,Amy>我要当众羞辱你
<9-6,Amy>I'm gonna publicly shame you,

389
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,700
<9-6,Amy>然后我就坐等社会的压力
<9-6,Amy>and then sit back as societal pressure

390
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,620
<9-6,Amy>迫使你修正自己的行为
<9-6,Amy>compels you to modify your behavior.

391
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:37,240
<9-7,Penny>迎头痛击啊
<9-7,Penny>Ooh, buuurn!

392
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:40,150
<9-8,Amy>如果你以后还不对我好一点
<9-8,Amy>And if you don't start treating me better,

393
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:40,760
<9-8,Amy>我就跟你分手
<9-8,Amy>I'm leaving you

394
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,140
<9-8,Amy>然后跟小马农阿曼一起
<9-8,Amy>for a miniature horse breeder named Armen.

395
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:46,550
<9-9,Sheldon>哪个阿曼
<9-9,Sheldon>Armen who?

396
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:48,600
<9-10,Amy>阿文就是...见鬼
<9-10,Amy>Armen... damn it.

397
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,920
<9-11,Penny>谢尔顿  她想在家人面前炫耀一下你
<9-11,Penny>Look, Sheldon, she wanted to show you off to her family,

398
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,580
<9-11,Penny>你却放她鸽子  好吧
<9-11,Penny>and you stood her up, okay?

399
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:58,270
<9-11,Penny>看看她这可爱又伤感的表情
<9-11,Penny>Look at this adorable, smushy face.

400
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:00,600
<9-11,Penny>多伤感  多痛苦  多郁闷啊
<9-11,Penny>Smush, smush, smush.

401
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,680
<9-12,Amy>你弄痛我了
<9-12,Amy>You're hurting me.

402
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,790
<9-13,Penny>错  弄痛你的是谢尔顿
<9-13,Penny>No, Sheldon hurt you.

403
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,110
<9-14,Amy>之前他让我心痛  现在是你让我脸痛
<9-14,Amy>Before; now it's you.

404
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,690
<9-16,Sheldon>我明白了
<9-16,Sheldon>I think I understand.

405
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:13,830
<9-16,Sheldon>这世界上只有你一个
<9-16,Sheldon>You're the one person

406
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:16,620
<9-16,Sheldon>可以说谢尔顿·库珀是你男友
<9-16,Sheldon>who can say Sheldon Cooper is your boyfriend,

407
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:18,010
<9-16,Sheldon>但这话毕竟有些空洞
<9-16,Sheldon>but that rings hollow

408
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:20,770
<9-16,Sheldon>如果你不能让他亲自去证明
<9-16,Sheldon>if you can't lord him over others in the flesh.

409
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,990
<9-16,Sheldon>我忘了  我能让他们蓬荜生辉
<9-16,Sheldon>I forget what I bring to the party

410
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:26,150
<9-16,Sheldon>我走后  也会让他们怅然若失
<9-16,Sheldon>and what I take away when I leave.

411

<9-16,Sheldon>请接受这些珍贵的库珀优惠券

00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:08,100
<9-20,Raj>你们到底知不知道
<9-20,Raj>Do you have any idea what it's like

427
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,170
<9-20,Raj>只有我一个人没女朋友  是什么心情呀
<9-20,Raj>to be the only one without a girlfriend?

428
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:12,640
<9-20,Raj>即使我哪天有了女友
<9-20,Raj>Even if I get one someday,

429
