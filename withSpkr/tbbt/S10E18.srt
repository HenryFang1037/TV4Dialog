00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:05,410
<1-1,Leonard>你看到拉杰刚才发的状态了吗
<1-1,Leonard>Aw, man, did you see this post from Raj?

2
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:07,810
<1-2,Penny>发什么了  又一部他跟他的狗
<1-2,Penny>What? Is it another video of him and his dog

3
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:11,520
<1-2,Penny>"小姐与流浪汉式"地共吃面条影片吗
<1-2,Penny>Lady-and-the-Tramping some spaghetti?

4
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:11,520
<1-2,Penny>迪士尼卡通电影经典段落
<1-2,Penny>片中两条狗从一条面条的两端慢慢吃到亲嘴

5
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:13,530
<1-3,Leonard>不是  他住不起那个公寓了
<1-3,Leonard>No. He can't afford his apartment,

6
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,570
<1-3,Leonard>在问有没有人知道哪里有便宜的住处
<1-3,Leonard>and he's asking if anyone knows of a cheap place to live.

7
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:20,110
<1-3,Leonard>我想回"印度"  但感觉太贱了
<1-3,Leonard>I want to say "India," but it seems mean.

8
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:24,170
<2-1,Bernadette>什么事那么好笑
<2-1,Bernadette>What's so funny?

9
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:26,320
<2-2,Howard>拉杰在找便宜的地方住
<2-2,Howard>Raj is looking for a cheap place to live,

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,870
<2-2,Howard>我回了"印度"
<2-2,Howard>and I wrote "India."

11
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,330
<2-3,Bernadette>别回这个  给人家点支持
<2-3,Bernadette>Don't post that; be supportive.

12
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:37,180
<2-4,Howard>那你怎么不支持一下我的这些搞笑段子
<2-4,Howard>Maybe you should be supportive of my hilarious jokes.

13
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:39,620
<2-4,Howard>行  那我们该怎么做
<2-4,Howard>Fine, what should we do?

14
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,020
<2-5,Bernadette>我们这么聪明  肯定能想出办法
<2-5,Bernadette>We're smart. I'm sure we can think of something.

15
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,850
<2-6,Howard>你想让他住我们这里吗
<2-6,Howard>You want to let him live here?

16
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:46,500
<2-7,Bernadette>我们绝对比那聪明多了
<2-7,Bernadette>Oh, we're smarter than that.

17
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,520
<3-1,Sheldon>我知道我们的公寓很小
<3-1,Sheldon>I know our apartment's small,

18
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,360
<3-1,Sheldon>但挤一挤还是能挤出位子吧
<3-1,Sheldon>but I think we can make room.

19
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,600
<3-2,Amy>谢尔顿  不行
<3-2,Amy>No, Sheldon.

20
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:57,360
<3-2,Amy>不许买真人大小的蜘蛛侠人像
<3-2,Amy>We are not getting a life-size Spider-Man statue.

21
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:00,090
<3-2,Amy>家里的确还有谢尔顿的旧房间
<3-2,Amy>We do have Sheldon's old room.

22
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,420
<4-1,Leonard>如果他真的需要落脚处
<4-1,Leonard>If he really needs a place to stay,

23
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:03,250
<4-1,Leonard>我们可以让给他住
<4-1,Leonard>I guess we should offer it to him.

24
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:04,960
<4-2,Penny>你真是个好兄弟
<4-2,Penny>You're a good friend.

25
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:07,550
<4-3,Leonard>那如果我先等一会儿并期待
<4-3,Leonard>Am I still a good friend if I wait and hope

26
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:10,250
<4-3,Leonard>霍华德先邀他去住他家  还算好兄弟吗
<4-3,Leonard>that Howard offers him a place to live first?

27
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:13,470
<4-4,Penny>你还是个更棒的老公
<4-4,Penny>You're an even better husband.

28
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,420
<4-4,Penny>我知道如果是换作我落魄
<4-4,Penny>I know if the roles were reversed,

29
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:18,370
<5-1,Howard>他一定会伸出援手
<5-1,Howard>he would do it for me.

30
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:19,460
<5-2,Bernadette>那他睡哪啊
<5-2,Bernadette>Where would he stay?

31
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:21,340
<5-2,Bernadette>我们已经收留斯图尔特了
<5-2,Bernadette>We already have Stuart.

32
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:23,590
<5-3,Howard>我们可以在车库里腾出位子啊
<5-3,Howard>Well, we can make some space in the garage.

33
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:25,500
<5-3,Howard>给他弄个小床
<5-3,Howard>Maybe put a cot out there,

34
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,430
<5-3,Howard>再弄台小暖气  或者一台电热炉
<5-3,Howard>get him a space heater, maybe a hot plate.

35
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:29,610
<5-4,Bernadette>听起来好惨啊
<5-4,Bernadette>That sounds awful.

36
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,470
<5-5,Howard>希望他也会这么觉得
<5-5,Howard>Let's hope he thinks so, too.

37
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:34,330
<5-5,Howard>我再说一次
<5-5,Howard>For the last time,

38
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:38,990
<6-1,Amy>绿巨人  蝙蝠侠  任何真人大小人像都不行
<6-1,Amy>no Hulk, no Batman, no life-size statues.

39
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,540
<6-2,Sheldon>我开始觉得其实
<6-2,Sheldon>I'm starting to think you didn't mean it

40
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:45,320
<6-2,Sheldon>你并不是真心想要布置一下家里
<6-2,Sheldon>when you said you wanted to spruce up the place.

55
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,880
<6-2,Sheldon>你好
<6-2,Sheldon>Hello.

56
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,640
<7-1,Raj (answering phone)>我与妮妮讨论了一下
<7-1,Raj (answering phone)>Hey, uh, so we've been talking,

57
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,920
<7-2,Howard>如果你需要地方住
<7-2,Howard>and if you need a place to stay,

58
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,690
<7-2,Howard>我们很乐意帮你收拾一下车库
<7-2,Howard>we'd be happy to fix up the garage for you.

59
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:25,580
<7-3,Raj>那就太棒了
<7-3,Raj>That would be amazing!

60
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,820
<7-3,Raj>我刚才真的就看着我的纸箱子
<7-3,Raj>I was literally just looking at my moving boxes,

61
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:30,970
<7-3,Raj>寻思着要挑哪个住进去了
<7-3,Raj>trying to pick one to live in.

62
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:32,450
<7-4,Howard>虽然条件不太理想
<7-4,Howard>I know it's not ideal,

63
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:34,510
<7-4,Howard>但好歹里面有很多空间放你的家具
<7-4,Howard>but you'd have plenty of space for your furniture,

64
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:35,930
<7-4,Howard>还有个很酷的按钮
<7-4,Howard>and there's this cool button

65
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:39,090
<7-4,Howard>能让你其中一面"墙"卷起来又放下去呢
<7-4,Howard>that makes an entire wall go up and down.

66
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,660
<7-5,Raj>真是太感谢你了
<7-5,Raj>I cannot thank you enough.

67
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,220
<7-6,Howard>能帮你我们也很高兴
<7-6,Howard>It is our pleasure.

68
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,110
<7-6,Howard>你能等我一下吗
<7-6,Howard>Hey, can you hold on one sec?

69
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:46,540
<7-6,Howard>你好
<7-6,Howard>Hello?

70
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,110
<7-7,Leonard>兄弟  你还在找地方住吗
<7-7,Leonard>Hey, buddy, you still looking for a place to live?

71
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,960
<7-8,Raj>是啊
<7-8,Raj>Uh... yeah.

72
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,990
<7-8,Raj>为什么这么问
<7-8,Raj>Why do you ask?

73
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:54,500
<7-9,Leonard>我们这里有多一间空房间
<7-9,Leonard>You know, we have the extra bedroom,

74
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,510
<7-9,Leonard>如果你有需要  那就让你住吧
<7-9,Leonard>and if you need it, it's yours.

75
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,650
<7-10,Raj>天啊  你们真是太大方了
<7-10,Raj>Oh, my God, that's so generous!

76
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,200
<7-11,Leonard>小事一件不足挂齿
<7-11,Leonard>It's the least we can do.

77
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,060
<7-12,Raj>我真的很感谢
<7-12,Raj>I-I really appreciate it.

78
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,880
<7-12,Raj>你能稍等我一下吗
<7-12,Raj>Uh, can you hold on one second?

79
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:09,440
<7-12,Raj>霍华德  所以我的浴室是怎么样
<7-12,Raj>Hey, so, Howard, what's the bathroom situation gonna be?

80
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,200
<7-13,Howard>外面有个水槽...
<7-13,Howard>Well, there's a sink out there--

81
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,420
<7-13,Howard>能帮你解决你一半的问题
<7-13,Howard>that takes care of half your problems.

82
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,810
<7-14,Raj>但是我能用楼下的浴室对吧
<7-14,Raj>But I can use the downstairs bathroom, right?

83
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:21,830
<7-15,Howard>行  我们不怎么用  跟你的独立卫浴差不多
<7-15,Howard>Yeah. We barely use it, so it'll be like it's yours.

84
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:22,780
<7-16,Raj>很好  很好
<7-16,Raj>Cool, cool, yeah.

85
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:25,210
<7-16,Raj>-那你再稍等我一下  -什么
<7-16,Raj>- Yeah, hold on one second. - Wh...?

86
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:28,320
<7-18,Raj>跟佩妮共用一个浴室是什么感觉
<7-18,Raj>Hey, what's it like sharing a bathroom with Penny?

87
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,660
<7-18,Raj>会不会到处都是她的头发
<7-18,Raj>Is there hair everywhere?

88
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:32,620
<7-18,Raj>她会不会偷用你的浴球
<7-18,Raj>Does she use your loofah?

89
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:34,160
<7-19,Leonard>我没有浴球
<7-19,Leonard>I don't have a loofah.

90
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,840
<7-20,Raj>好吧  如果我搬进去  你也不许用我的
<7-20,Raj>Okay, well, if I move in, you can't use mine.

91
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,930
<7-20,Raj>再等我一下
<7-20,Raj>Hold on a second.

92
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:43,020
<7-20,Raj>霍华德  车库里的无线网信号如何
<7-20,Raj>Hey, Howard, uh, how's the Wi-Fi in the garage?

93
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:43,860
<7-20,Raj>我也不知道
<7-20,Raj>I don't know.

94
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,290
<7-21,Howard>你为啥要问这么多问题啊
<7-21,Howard>Why are you asking all these questions?

95
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:48,500
<7-22,Raj>老实告诉你  莱纳德也在跟我通话
<7-22,Raj>Well, to be honest, Leonard's on the other line,

96
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,640
<7-22,Raj>他邀请我去住他家那间空房
<7-22,Raj>and he offered me their spare bedroom.

97
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,520
<7-23,Howard>太好啦  住他那儿吧
<7-23,Howard>Great! Go live there.

98
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,490
<7-24,Raj>可是你把住车库说得很有趣啊
<7-24,Raj>But you made the garage sound so fun.

99
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:57,420
<7-25,Howard>我只是不想你觉得住车库很惨
<7-25,Howard>I just didn't want you to feel bad about it.

100
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,300
<7-25,Howard>除非莱纳德的公寓也会有浣熊
<7-25,Howard>Unless Leonard's apartment also has a raccoon

101
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,670
<7-25,Howard>在冬夜里啃破墙壁爬进来  不然就去住吧
<7-25,Howard>that chews its way in on cold nights, go there!

102
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,800
<7-25,Howard>等一会儿
<7-25,Howard>One second.

103
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,670
<7-26,Raj>就差最后一步了
<7-26,Raj>Okay, I think we're close.

104
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:10,650
<7-26,Raj>你对我房里放个小冰箱有意见吗
<7-26,Raj>How do you feel about a mini-fridge in my room?

105
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,670
<7-27,Penny>兄弟  你还想不想住了
<7-27,Penny>Hey, pal, you want to live here or not?

106
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:15,630
<7-28,Raj>佩妮  住住住  麻烦您了
<7-28,Raj>Oh, uh, hi, Penny. Yes, please.

107
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,500
<8-2,Amy>佩妮  这张传单是给"住户"的
<8-2,Amy>Uh, Penny, this circular is addressed to "Occupant,"

108
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,040
<8-3,Sheldon>但是我们现在换着住
<8-3,Sheldon>but with our apartment switch,

109
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,040
<8-3,Sheldon>我弄不太清是给你还是给我的
<8-3,Sheldon>it's unclear whether it's yours or mine.

110
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,020
<8-4,Penny>是干嘛的传单
<8-4,Penny>What's it for?

111
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:26,880
<8-5,Sheldon>铺屋顶
<8-5,Sheldon>Roofing.

112
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,240
<8-6,Penny>那肯定是你的了
<8-6,Penny>Yeah, it's yours.

113
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,490
<8-7,Sheldon>好吧  谢谢
<8-7,Sheldon>Okay, thanks.

114
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:33,890
<8-7,Sheldon>"直接扔了吧"
<8-7,Sheldon>"Just throw it out."

115
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:37,870
<8-7,Sheldon>说到住户  根据我听到的消息
<8-7,Sheldon>Speaking of occupants, I'm given to understand

116
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:40,180
<8-7,Sheldon>拉杰会搬到我以前的房间
<8-7,Sheldon>Raj will be moving into my old room.

117
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,610
<8-8,Leonard>是啊  暂住一阵
<8-8,Leonard>Yeah, for a little while.

118
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:42,960
<8-9,Sheldon>那他的狗呢
<8-9,Sheldon>What about his dog?

119
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,270
<8-10,Penny>她会住在她的笼子里  问题不大
<8-10,Penny>She'll be in her crate; it's not a big deal.

120
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,010
<8-11,Sheldon>那我还算能接受吧
<8-11,Sheldon>I suppose that's acceptable.

121
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:48,620
<8-12,Amy>谢尔顿现在比较敢接近狗了
<8-12,Amy>Well, Sheldon's getting a little better with dogs.

122
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:52,330
<8-12,Amy>他这次还在迪士尼乐园跟布鲁托合照了呢
<8-12,Amy>He even took a picture with Pluto at Disneyland.

123
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:56,750
<8-13,Sheldon>如果真的狗也会送我胸章  那我也喜欢他们
<8-13,Sheldon>If real dogs gave me buttons, I'd like them, too.

124
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,900
<8-13,Sheldon>我觉得你们愿意
<8-13,Sheldon>Well, I think it's very nice

125
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,700
<8-13,Sheldon>帮忙朋友是一件很棒的事
<8-13,Sheldon>that you're helping out our friend.

126
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,160
<8-14,Leonard>我倒觉得你也很棒  无论艾米给你什么药
<8-14,Leonard>I think it's nice that you're taking whatever medication

127
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,150
<8-14,Leonard>你都照单全吃
<8-14,Leonard>Amy's clearly giving you.

128
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,800
<8-15,Sheldon>这话是什么意思
<8-15,Sheldon>And what is that supposed to mean?

129
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,570
<8-16,Penny>这就跟某个科学定律一样
<8-16,Penny>Well, it's like that science thing.

130
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:11,370
<8-16,Penny>有任何举动[作用]
<8-16,Penny>For every action,

131
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:15,230
<8-16,Penny>你都会有又大又烦人的反应[反作用]
<8-16,Penny>you have a gigantic and annoying reaction.

132
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:19,110
<8-17,Leonard>真想不到我老婆美貌与智慧并存啊
<8-17,Leonard>Just when I thought you couldn't get any hotter.

133
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:23,040
<8-19,Sheldon>如果你俩是暗示我会不爽
<8-19,Sheldon>If you're implying that I'd have some problem

134
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,080
<8-19,Sheldon>拉杰搬进我的房间  那你们就错了
<8-19,Sheldon>with him moving into my room, you're wrong.

135
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,800
<8-19,Sheldon>拉杰现在的财务状况十分困难
<8-19,Sheldon>Raj is in a difficult financial situation,

136
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,350
<8-19,Sheldon>我很高兴他能做出改变去改善它
<8-19,Sheldon>and I'm glad that he's making changes to improve it.

137
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:33,130
<8-20,Leonard>药量不需要调整  你做得很好
<8-20,Leonard>Do not adjust the dosage. You nailed it.

138
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,500
<8-21,Amy>别听他们胡说
<8-21,Amy>Don't listen to them.

139
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,310
<8-21,Amy>奇怪的是佩妮居然差点就说对了一个科学事实
<8-21,Amy>What's weird is that Penny almost got a science fact right.

140
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:44,600
<8-22,Sheldon>太不公平了  人们都觉得我会不爽
<8-22,Sheldon>I mean, it's unfair; people just assume I'm going to be upset

141
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,810
<8-22,Sheldon>拉杰搬进我的旧房间
<8-22,Sheldon>by Raj moving into my old room.

142
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:48,490
<8-23,Amy>可你确实是  不是吗
<8-23,Amy>But you are, aren't you?

143
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:50,680
<8-24,Sheldon>我不爽到极点
<8-24,Sheldon>Oh, I'm outraged.

144
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,460
<8-25,Amy>跟我说说  到底怎么回事
<8-25,Amy>Talk to me. Tell me what's going on.

145
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:56,880
<8-26,Sheldon>在我没认识莱纳德之前  我就住那个房间
<8-26,Sheldon>Well, that's been my room since before I met Leonard,

146
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,340
<8-26,Sheldon>现在却有别人要搬进去住
<8-26,Sheldon>and now someone else is going to be living in it.

147
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,130
<8-26,Sheldon>而那个别人还不是我
<8-26,Sheldon>And that someone else is not me.

148
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:04,530
<8-26,Sheldon>你也知道我对于不是我的"别人"作何感想
<8-26,Sheldon>And you know how I feel about people who aren't me.

149
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:08,060
<8-27,Amy>我知道那个房间里充满了回忆
<8-27,Amy>There are a lot of memories wrapped up in that room.

150
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,850
<8-27,Amy>对我来说也是
<8-27,Amy>For me, too.

151
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:12,160
<8-27,Amy>你第一次说爱我就是在那个房间
<8-27,Amy>The first time you told me you loved me was in that room.

152
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,670
<8-27,Amy>错
<8-27,Amy>Wrong.

153
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:16,230
<8-28,Sheldon>当时我们站在我房间外的走廊
<8-28,Sheldon>We were standing outside my room in the hallway.

154
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:19,380
<8-29,Amy>这就是我刚说到的爱
<8-29,Amy>And there is the love of which I speak.

155
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,100
<8-30,Sheldon>我知道这样很不理性
<8-30,Sheldon>I realize it's irrational,

156
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:25,200
<8-30,Sheldon>但拉杰的入住让我觉得自己被取代了
<8-30,Sheldon>but with Raj moving in there, I'm feeling a bit replaced.

157
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,130
<8-31,Amy>现在对他来说是困难时期
<8-31,Amy>Well, this isn't an easy time for him.

158
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:30,890
<8-31,Amy>他公寓没了  还欠了一屁股债
<8-31,Amy>He's losing his apartment, he's in debt,

159
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,680
<8-31,Amy>他可能正羞愧难当呢
<8-31,Amy>he's probably humiliated.

160
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,730
<8-32,Sheldon>是啊  可能
<8-32,Sheldon>Yes, probably.

161
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:38,270
<8-32,Sheldon>但在确定之前  我该怎么才能舒坦呢
<8-32,Sheldon>But until we know for sure, how can I feel better?

162
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:41,580
<9-1,Raj>你们谁还需要什么吗
<9-1,Raj>Can I get anyone anything at all?

163
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,200
<9-2,Penny>拉杰  你不用服务我们
<9-2,Penny>Raj, you don't have to serve us.

164
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,350
<9-3,Raj>这是我该做的  谢谢你们帮我搬我的家当上楼
<9-3,Raj>It's the least I can do for helping me carry my stuff up.

165
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:48,100
<9-4,Howard>真的没什么大不了的
<9-4,Howard>It was really no problem.

166
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:51,840
<9-5,Bernadette>对你来说当然啦  你只搬了一箱毛巾
<9-5,Bernadette>Not for you, Box of Towels.

167
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,950
<9-6,Raj>总而言之  谢谢你们
<9-6,Raj>Anyway, thanks again.

168
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:54,990
<9-7,Howard>瞧瞧
<9-7,Howard>Hey, look at that.

169
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:57,110
<9-7,Howard>你们有拉杰  我们有斯图尔特
<9-7,Howard>You've got a Raj, we've got a Stuart.

170
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,790
<9-7,Howard>或许我们该带他俩去公园
<9-7,Howard>Maybe we should take them both to the park

171
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:01,190
<9-7,Howard>让他们一起撒欢跑跑
<9-7,Howard>and let them run around together.

172
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:06,250
<9-8,Leonard>我不知道  你那只看起来身上有虫子
<9-8,Leonard>I don't know. Yours looks like he has worms.

173
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:08,210
<10-1,Amy>可以走了吗
<10-1,Amy>You ready to go?

174
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:09,440
<10-2,Sheldon>一切准备妥当
<10-2,Sheldon>All set.

175
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,550
<10-3,Amy>那是什么
<10-3,Amy>What's that?

176
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:13,620
<10-4,Sheldon>给拉杰的乔迁礼物
<10-4,Sheldon>A housewarming gift for Raj.

177
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,930
<10-5,Amy>最好不是一大堆假蛇突然从里面冒出来
<10-5,Amy>Well, a bunch of fake snakes better not spring out of it,

178
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:19,240
<10-5,Amy>因为那是一份超烂的纪念日礼物
<10-5,Amy>'cause that was a lousy anniversary present.

179
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,220
<10-6,Sheldon>绝对不会
<10-6,Sheldon>It's nothing like that.

180
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,460
<10-6,Sheldon>我考虑到拉杰现在的情况
<10-6,Sheldon>I just, I thought about Raj's situation,

181
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,220
<10-6,Sheldon>于是我改变了主意
<10-6,Sheldon>and I had a change of heart.

182
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,580
<10-6,Sheldon>而且关于你的礼物
<10-6,Sheldon>You know, and regarding your gift,

183
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:30,800
<10-6,Sheldon>是你自己说"给我惊喜"  而我的确"惊"到你了
<10-6,Sheldon>you said "Surprise me," and, boy, did I.

184
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:34,640
<10-9,Leonard>时间刚刚好  食物都准备好了
<10-9,Leonard>Perfect timing. Food's ready.

185
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,810
<10-10,Sheldon>等等  在开吃之前  我有一份小小的
<10-10,Sheldon>Uh, wait-- before we eat, I have a little

186
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:38,960
<10-10,Sheldon>"欢迎入住"礼物要给拉杰
<10-10,Sheldon>"Welcome to the building" gift for Raj.

187
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,110
<10-11,Penny>慢着  是不是会蹦出什么...
<10-11,Penny>Wait, is anything gonna jump out...

188
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:42,510
<10-12,Amy>不是  我问过了
<10-12,Amy>No. I already asked.

189
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,780
<10-13,Raj>谢谢  谢尔顿
<10-13,Raj>Thank you, Sheldon.

190
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:48,540
<10-13,Raj>是一本...空白的笔记本
<10-13,Raj>It's a... blank notebook.

191
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,740
<10-14,Sheldon>我曾在那个房间里想出过不少好点子
<10-14,Sheldon>Well, I had some of my best ideas in that room,

192
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,270
<10-14,Sheldon>我相信你也会的
<10-14,Sheldon>and I'm sure you will, too.

193
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,930
<10-15,Howard>他也未曾在那个房间里做过爱呢
<10-15,Howard>He also never had sex in that room.

194
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,880
<10-15,Howard>那是另一件值得期盼的事情啊
<10-15,Howard>That's something else to look forward to.

195
00:07:58,730 --> 00:07:59,930
<10-16,Raj>这对我来说意义重大
<10-16,Raj>This means a lot.

196
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:02,080
<10-17,Sheldon>我知道现在对你来说是困难时期
<10-17,Sheldon>Well, I know this is a difficult time for you.

197
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,610
<10-17,Sheldon>你的公寓没了  还欠了一屁股债
<10-17,Sheldon>Y-You're losing your apartment, you're in debt,

198
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:06,570
<10-17,Sheldon>你可能...肯定羞愧难当吧
<10-17,Sheldon>and you just-- you must be humiliated.

199
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:07,360
<10-18,Amy>谢尔顿
<10-18,Amy>Sheldon...

200
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,770
<10-19,Sheldon>哎呀  老天
<10-19,Sheldon>Oh, good grief.

201
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:11,040
<10-19,Sheldon>她真爱拘泥于细节  非得注明出处
<10-19,Sheldon>She is such a stickler for citing sources.

202
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,630
<10-19,Sheldon>那些都是艾米的原话
<10-19,Sheldon>Those were Amy's words.

203
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:14,420
<10-18,Amy>谢尔顿
<10-18,Amy>Sheldon...

204
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,660
<10-21,Sheldon>我知道  我知道
<10-21,Sheldon>I know, I know!

205
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:20,020
<10-21,Sheldon>"哎呀  老天"是查理·布朗的原话  真是够了
<10-21,Sheldon>"Good grief" was originally said by Charlie Brown, geez.

206
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:20,020
<10-21,Sheldon>美国著名漫画《史努比》里的主人公
<10-21,Sheldon>他犯错或是遇到难题时的口头禅

207
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:22,110
<10-22,Raj>你说得对  我是羞愧难当
<10-22,Raj>You're right, I am humiliated.

208
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,340
<10-22,Raj>多谢当面指出来
<10-22,Raj>Thanks for pointing it out.

209
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,330
<10-22,Raj>你真是个混蛋
<10-22,Raj>You're such a jerk.

210
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:26,830
<10-23,Sheldon>你们能相信他居然这么说我吗
<10-23,Sheldon>Can you believe this guy?

211
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:29,090
<10-24,Everyone>能
<10-24,Everyone>Yes.

212
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:32,590
<10-25,Sheldon>我还以为会听到另一种答案呢
<10-25,Sheldon>I-I thought that was gonna break the other way.

213
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:33,460
<10-26,Amy>走吧  谢尔顿
<10-26,Amy>Come on, Sheldon.

214
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,120
<10-26,Amy>或许我们应该回自己公寓吃饭
<10-26,Amy>Maybe we should just eat at our place.

215
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,410
<20-7,Stuart>好吧
<20-7,Stuart>Fine.

216
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:38,210
<10-27,Sheldon>你占了我的房间
<10-27,Sheldon>You took my room.

217
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:39,520
<10-27,Sheldon>你还让我的朋友跟我翻脸
<10-27,Sheldon>You turned my friends against me.

218
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,720
<10-27,Sheldon>现在你开心啦
<10-27,Sheldon>I hope you're happy.

219
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,880
<10-28,Raj>我有什么值得开心的
<10-28,Raj>What do I have to be happy about?

220
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,750
<10-28,Raj>我的人生一团糟
<10-28,Raj>My life's a wreck.

221
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,200
<10-29,Sheldon>为什么他可以说出来  而我却不能
<10-29,Sheldon>How come he can say it and I can't?

222
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,060
<10-30,Amy>快走吧你
<10-30,Amy>Just keep walking.

223
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,980
<10-30,Amy>你好呀  谢尔顿
<10-30,Amy>Hello, Sheldon.

224
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,340
<11-1,Beverley (on skype)>真是意外之喜呀
<11-1,Beverley (on skype)>What a pleasant surprise.

225
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,710
<11-1,Beverley (on skype)>你好吗
<11-1,Beverley (on skype)>How are you?

226
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:59,700
<11-2,Sheldon>老实说  最近好多了
<11-2,Sheldon>Honestly, I've been better.

227
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,860
<11-2,Sheldon>你有时间吗
<11-2,Sheldon>Do you have time?

228
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:03,180
<11-2,Sheldon>莱纳德说你最近很忙
<11-2,Sheldon>Leonard says you're very busy these days.

229
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:06,350
<11-3,Beverley>我这么说是因为他爱闲聊
<11-3,Beverley>Oh, I just say that because he prattles.

230
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,840
<11-3,Beverley>发生什么事了
<11-3,Beverley>What's going on?

231
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:12,650
<11-4,Sheldon>我们的朋友拉杰搬进了我的旧房间
<11-4,Sheldon>Well, our friend Raj moved into my old room,

232
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:16,670
<11-4,Sheldon>这事导致我产生了很多负面情绪
<11-4,Sheldon>and it's brought up a lot of negative feelings for me.

233
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:20,400
<11-5,Beverley>你觉得失去你的旧房间代表了什么
<11-5,Beverley>Well, what do you think the loss of your room represents?

234
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,810
<11-6,Sheldon>贝弗利  你知道我十分敬重你
<11-6,Sheldon>Beverly, you know I hold you in high esteem.

235
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:25,200
<11-6,Sheldon>我们可以跳过你假装不知道答案的戏码
<11-6,Sheldon>Can we skip the part where you pretend not to know the answer,

236
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,660
<11-6,Sheldon>直接进入你告诉我答案的环节吗
<11-6,Sheldon>and get to the part where you tell me the answer?

237
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:31,120
<11-7,Beverley>好的  但你不介意的话
<11-7,Beverley>Very well, but, uh, if you don't mind,

238
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,090
<11-7,Beverley>为了戏剧化效果  我还是要停顿一下
<11-7,Beverley>I'd still like to pause for effect.

239
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,860
<11-7,Beverley>现在嘛...
<11-7,Beverley>Now...

240
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:41,390
<11-7,Beverley>你最近和福勒博士同居了  对吧
<11-7,Beverley>You've recently moved in with Dr. Fowler, yes?

241
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:42,910
<11-8,Sheldon>没错
<11-8,Sheldon>I have.

242
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:46,550
<11-9,Beverley>显然你的旧房间代表了一个逃生出口
<11-9,Beverley>Clearly, your old room represents an escape hatch,

243
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,480
<11-9,Beverley>倘若失去了这出口  你就将被迫面对
<11-9,Beverley>and without it, you're forced to confront

244
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,590
<11-9,Beverley>和艾米永远生活
<11-9,Beverley>the terrifying reality of being trapped

245
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:54,970
<11-9,Beverley>在一起的可怕现实
<11-9,Beverley>in a relationship with Amy forever.

246
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,790
<11-10,Sheldon>我从未想过这问题
<11-10,Sheldon>I hadn't thought about that.

247
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:59,850
<11-11,Amy>现在也别开始想
<11-11,Amy>And don't start thinking about it now!

248
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:02,720
<11-12,Beverley>你好呀  艾米
<11-12,Beverley>Hello, Amy.

249
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,900
<11-12,Beverley>你的这种防御表现似乎也在暗示
<11-12,Beverley>Your defensiveness may indicate similar insecurities

250
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,910
<11-12,Beverley>你对于这份感情有同样的不安全感
<11-12,Beverley>about your relationship with Sheldon.

251
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,200
<11-13,Amy>才不是这样的
<11-13,Amy>That's not true!

252
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,030
<11-14,Beverley>她极具防御性地说
<11-14,Beverley>She said defensively.

253
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:14,900
<11-15,Amy>这不是关于我和谢尔顿的问题
<11-15,Amy>This isn't about me and Sheldon.

254
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:18,340
<11-15,Amy>而是拉杰要搬去和莱纳德还有佩妮一起住
<11-15,Amy>This is about Rajesh moving in with Leonard and Penny.

255
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,410
<11-16,Beverley>有点意思
<11-16,Beverley>Interesting.

256
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:24,610
<11-16,Beverley>他们发现自己需要再找一个室友了
<11-16,Beverley>They've found a need to take yet another roommate.

257
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:28,670
<11-16,Beverley>看来他们也在努力回避二人世界中的残酷现实呀
<11-16,Beverley>Seems they're avoiding some harsh realities themselves.

258
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:29,970
<11-17,Sheldon>我真没想到
<11-17,Sheldon>I had no idea

259
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:32,700
<11-17,Sheldon>我们这些人的感情生活都是一团乱麻
<11-17,Sheldon>all our relationships were such a disaster.

260
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,990
<11-17,Sheldon>唉呀妈呀  你可真厉害
<11-17,Sheldon>Boy, you're good.

261
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:36,460
<11-18,Beverley>道上的确都是这么传的
<11-18,Beverley>That is the word on the street, dear.

262
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,890
<12-1,Raj>也许搬进来并不是个好主意
<12-1,Raj>Maybe moving in was a bad idea.

263
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:44,330
<12-1,Raj>我屁股还没坐热  就已经开始制造麻烦了
<12-1,Raj>I haven't been here one day, I'm already causing problems.

264
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:46,620
<12-2,Penny>这不是你的错  都怪谢尔顿
<12-2,Penny>You didn't do anything. It's Sheldon.

265
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,120
<12-2,Penny>"这不是你的错  都怪谢尔顿"
<12-2,Penny>"You didn't do anything. It's Sheldon."

266
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,530
<12-3,Leonard>这句话太适合绣在靠垫上了
<12-3,Leonard>That'd make a nice needlepoint pillow.

267
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,310
<12-4,Penny>放轻松  我们很欢迎你来住
<12-4,Penny>So, relax. We're happy to have you.

268
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:55,360
<12-5,Raj>多谢  不过我怎么知道
<12-5,Raj>Thank you, but how do I know

269
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,280
<12-5,Raj>你不是为了安慰我才这么说的呢
<12-5,Raj>you're not saying that just to be nice?

270
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,820
<12-6,Penny>你怎么花钱剪了个狗啃似的发型
<12-6,Penny>Do you actually pay for that haircut?

271
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:01,120
<12-7,Raj>现在我知道了
<12-7,Raj>That'll do it.

272
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:04,760
<12-8,Sheldon>拉杰  我欠你一个道歉
<12-8,Sheldon>Hey, Raj, I owe you an apology.

273
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,620
<12-8,Sheldon>你能给你那狗拴个绳子吗
<12-8,Sheldon>Look, could you please put your dog on a leash?

274
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,940
<12-9,Raj>谢尔顿  我这狗不咬人
<12-9,Raj>Sheldon, she's fine.

275
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,060
<12-10,Sheldon>那你把她抱紧了
<12-10,Sheldon>Well, then at least hold her still

276
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:13,390
<12-10,Sheldon>我好假装她是个动物标本
<12-10,Sheldon>so I can pretend she's stuffed.

277
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:17,270
<12-10,Sheldon>拉杰  我一时没控制住自己的情绪
<12-10,Sheldon>Raj, I let my emotions get the best of me,

278
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:19,700
<12-10,Sheldon>乱拿你来出气
<12-10,Sheldon>and I unfairly took it out on you.

279
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,370
<12-11,Raj>谢谢  谢谢你这么说
<12-11,Raj>Thank you. I appreciate that.

280
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:22,630
<12-12,Sheldon>不  功劳不在我身上
<12-12,Sheldon>No, I can't take all the credit.

281
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:25,530
<12-12,Sheldon>我和莱纳德的妈妈聊了聊  她开解了我
<12-12,Sheldon>I spoke with Leonard's mother, and she made me feel better.

282
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:28,950
<12-13,Leonard>我不知道你和谁聊了  但会开解人的一定不是我妈
<12-13,Leonard>I don't know who you talked to, but that wasn't my mother.

283
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:34,770
<12-14,Sheldon>贝弗利指出我在和艾米的恋爱关系中
<12-14,Sheldon>Beverly pointed out that I'm experiencing insecurities

284
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:36,300
<12-14,Sheldon>存在不安全感
<12-14,Sheldon>in my relationship with Amy,

285
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:40,010
<12-14,Sheldon>就像莱纳德和佩妮也存在同样的问题
<12-14,Sheldon>in the same way that Leonard and Penny are in their relationship.

286
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:42,700
<12-15,Penny>你在乱说什么呀  我们俩好着呢
<12-15,Penny>What are you talking about? We're fine.

287
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,790
<12-16,Sheldon>你俩好着的前提是有一个缓冲人同住
<12-16,Sheldon>Yes, you're fine as long as you have a buffer

288
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:47,320
<12-16,Sheldon>才能帮你们转移婚姻中出现的问题
<12-16,Sheldon>living with you to distract from your marital problems.

289
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,630
<12-16,Sheldon>从前我就是那个缓冲人
<12-16,Sheldon>It used to be me.

291
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:52,310
<12-16,Sheldon>现在轮到拉杰和他的攻击性毛毛球了
<12-16,Sheldon>Now it's Raj and his attack Tribble.

292
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,780
<12-16,Sheldon>总之  我很抱歉
<12-16,Sheldon>Anyway, I'm sorry for everything.

293
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:58,640
<12-16,Sheldon>顺带一提  如果他们吵架时你哇哇大哭
<12-16,Sheldon>Oh, and FYI-- if you cry while they're fighting,

294
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,010
<12-16,Sheldon>他们就会带你去麦当劳
<12-16,Sheldon>they'll take you to McDonald's.

295
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,620
<13-1,Beverley (on skype)>你好  莱纳德
<13-1,Beverley (on skype)>Hello, Leonard.

296
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,920
<13-2,Leonard>你为什么说我们有婚姻问题呀
<13-2,Leonard>Why are you saying we have marital problems?

297
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,950
<13-2,Leonard>我们才没有婚姻问题呢
<13-2,Leonard>We don't have marital problems!

298
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:17,840
<13-3,Beverley>我懂了  那你是因为太过幸福美满才对我哇哇叫
<13-3,Beverley>I see. You must be yelling at me out of wedded bliss.

299
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:22,550
<13-4,Leonard>就因为我们收留朋友来住
<13-4,Leonard>Look, just because we took our friend in does not mean

300
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,820
<13-4,Leonard>并不代表我和佩妮害怕两人独处
<13-4,Leonard>that Penny and I are afraid to be alone.

301
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,370
<13-5,Penny>没错  这次是特殊情况
<13-5,Penny>Yeah, this is a special circumstance.

302
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:29,840
<13-6,Beverley>谢尔顿提到你也曾想让
<13-6,Beverley>Sheldon mentioned you tried to get your brother

303
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,660
<13-6,Beverley>你哥哥住到家里来
<13-6,Beverley>to live with you, as well.

304
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:34,150
<13-7,Penny>是啊  有些情况就算发生两次
<13-7,Penny>Yeah, well, a circumstance can happen twice

305
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:36,950
<13-7,Penny>仍然可以算作特殊
<13-7,Penny>and still be special.

306
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:38,830
<13-8,Beverley>你同意吗
<13-8,Beverley>Do you agree with that?

307
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:40,830
<13-9,Leonard>既然你这么指出来...
<13-9,Leonard>Well, now that you point it out...

308
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,450
<13-10,Penny>你疯了吧
<13-10,Penny>Are you kidding me?

309
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:44,810
<13-11,Leonard>我们好像真的一直在找新室友
<13-11,Leonard>We do seem to keep finding roommates.

310
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:46,490
<13-12,Penny>你现在和她站一边了吗
<13-12,Penny>Now you're taking her side?

311
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:49,680
<13-13,Beverley>亲爱的  我永远不会夹在你和莱纳德之间
<13-13,Beverley>Dear, I would never come between you and Leonard.

312
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:54,320
<13-13,Beverley>这是你们一加强连的室友的工作
<13-13,Beverley>That's for your parade of roommates to do.

313
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,730
<14-1,Raj>霍华德
<14-1,Raj>Howard?

314
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:00,650
<14-1,Raj>霍华德
<14-1,Raj>Howard!

315
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,170
<14-1,Raj>是我  是我呀
<14-1,Raj>It's me! It's just me!

316
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:07,550
<14-2,Howard>你跑到我们卧室来干嘛
<14-2,Howard>What are you doing here?!

317
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:10,290
<14-3,Raj>人家给你发了短信  可你没有回复
<14-3,Raj>Well, I texted you, but you didn't respond.

318
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,970
<14-3,Raj>莱纳德和佩妮在吵架...
<14-3,Raj>Leonard and Penny were arguing...

319
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:14,520
<14-4,Stuart>本大爷在此  谁敢撒野
<14-4,Stuart>Not on my watch!

320
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,790
<14-5,Bernadette>没事了  是拉杰
<14-5,Bernadette>It's fine. It's just Raj.

321
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:20,780
<14-5,Bernadette>我不介意你拿球棒敲死他  但我们没事
<14-5,Bernadette>You can hit him with the bat, but it's fine.

322
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:24,040
<14-6,Stuart>如果我心跳停止了  请让我放弃治疗
<14-6,Stuart>And if my heart stops, just let me go.

323
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,430
<14-7,Raj>抱歉了各位
<14-7,Raj>I'm sorry, guys.

324
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,180
<14-7,Raj>谢尔顿在生气  莱纳德和佩妮在吵架
<14-7,Raj>Sheldon was upset, Leonard and Penny were fighting.

325
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:31,640
<14-7,Raj>我只想待在一个不会造成别人问题的地方
<14-7,Raj>I just wanted to go someplace where I wasn't causing problems.

326
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,340
<14-8,Howard>我要再说一次
<14-8,Howard>I'll say it again.

327
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,680
<14-8,Howard>你老家印度
<14-8,Howard>India.

328
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:40,910
<14-9,Raj>能让我住在车库吗
<14-9,Raj>Can I just stay in the garage?

329
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,510
<14-10,Bernadette>别这样  今晚你先睡沙发吧
<14-10,Bernadette>Don't do that. We'll make up the couch for you

330
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:44,190
<14-10,Bernadette>明早起来再想办法
<14-10,Bernadette>and figure out something in the morning.

331
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,080
<14-11,Raj>谢谢
<14-11,Raj>Thank you.

332
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,130
<14-12,Stuart>来吧  我帮你铺上床单
<14-12,Stuart>Come on, I'll get you some sheets.

333
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:48,860
<14-12,Stuart>然后再测测我的血压
<14-12,Stuart>Then we'll see if I can beat my high score

334
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:51,540
<14-12,Stuart>是不是冲上新高了
<14-12,Stuart>on the blood pressure machine.

335
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,630
<14-13,Howard>咱们就不该把这些熊孩子留在身边
<14-13,Howard>Never should've had all these kids so close together.

336
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:10,790
<15-1,Amy>你没事吧
<15-1,Amy>You okay?

337
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,030
<15-2,Sheldon>我睡不着
<15-2,Sheldon>I can't sleep.

338
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:16,340
<15-3,Amy>怎么了
<15-3,Amy>What's wrong?

339
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,620
<15-4,Sheldon>贝弗利觉得
<15-4,Sheldon>Beverly believes

340
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:21,890
<15-4,Sheldon>我潜意识中把我的旧房间当做一个逃生出口
<15-4,Sheldon>I unconsciously consider my old room an escape hatch.

341
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:23,790
<15-5,Amy>你在为这件事烦恼吗
<15-5,Amy>Is that bothering you?

342
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:27,020
<15-6,Sheldon>没错  我才不喜欢什么潜意识呢
<15-6,Sheldon>Yes. I don't care for unconscious thoughts.

343
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,550
<15-6,Sheldon>人家和大脑是一辈子的好朋友
<15-6,Sheldon>My brain and I are best friends.

344
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:30,840
<15-6,Sheldon>它什么事都会告诉我
<15-6,Sheldon>It should tell me everything.

345
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:34,130
<15-7,Amy>我是说和我们恋情的关系
<15-7,Amy>I mean, how it relates to our relationship,

346
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:37,920
<15-7,Amy>不是你和你大脑的兄弟浪漫史
<15-7,Amy>not the bromance between you and your brain.

347
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,800
<15-8,Sheldon>万一她是对的呢
<15-8,Sheldon>What if she's correct?

348
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,860
<15-8,Sheldon>就是说我俩之间有问题吗
<15-8,Sheldon>Doesn't that say something troubling about us?

349
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,090
<15-8,Sheldon>我不知道
<15-8,Sheldon>I don't know.

350
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:47,010
<15-9,Amy>我只是觉得你是喜欢安排好
<15-9,Amy>I just think you're the kind of person

351
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:50,650
<15-9,Amy>应急计划的人
<15-9,Amy>who likes a contingency plan.

352
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:52,670
<15-10,Sheldon>这倒是
<15-10,Sheldon>That is true.

353
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:54,440
<15-10,Sheldon>你知道吗
<15-10,Sheldon>Did you know I figured out

354
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,610
<15-10,Sheldon>我已经想清楚了  世界末日来临后
<15-10,Sheldon>in which order I would eat all my friends

355
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:59,790
<15-10,Sheldon>我会按什么顺序吃掉所有朋友
<15-10,Sheldon>in the event of an apocalypse?

356
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,660
<15-11,Amy>你不可以再和你的大脑整天混在一起了
<15-11,Amy>You need to stop hanging out with your brain so much.

357
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,500
<15-11,Amy>它就是个坏朋友
<15-11,Amy>It's not a good influence.

358
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:10,670
<16-1,Stuart>如果你是想找零钱
<16-1,Stuart>If you're looking for spare change,

359
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,570
<16-1,Stuart>我已经扫荡干净了
<16-1,Stuart>I already cleaned it out.

360
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:19,170
<16-2,Raj>没想到我的人生会变成这样
<16-2,Raj>Didn't think this is where my life would be.

361
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:20,100
<16-3,Stuart>我也是
<16-3,Stuart>Me, either.

362
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,280
<16-3,Stuart>我有卧室你睡沙发
<16-3,Stuart>I'm in a bedroom and you're on a couch.

363
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,390
<16-3,Stuart>我居然是赢家
<16-3,Stuart>I'm actually winning.

364
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,850
<16-4,Raj>咱俩都正走霉运
<16-4,Raj>You know, we're both down on our luck.

365
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:29,230
<16-4,Raj>也许我俩应该找地方一起住
<16-4,Raj>Maybe you and I should try to get a place together.

366
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:31,480
<16-5,Stuart>听我说
<16-5,Stuart>Okay, listen to me.

367
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,120
<16-5,Stuart>根本没理由离开这里
<16-5,Stuart>There is no reason to leave here.

368
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,260
<16-5,Stuart>这里很棒  所有人都很友好
<16-5,Stuart>This is great. Everyone's nice.

369
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,740
<16-5,Stuart>非常舒服
<16-5,Stuart>It's comfortable.

370
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:44,080
<16-5,Stuart>如果一切按计划进行  这里就是我的养老院了
<16-5,Stuart>If all goes according to plan, this is my retirement home.

371
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:46,070
<16-6,Raj>如果你更加独立的话
<16-6,Raj>Wouldn't you feel better about yourself

372
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,400
<16-6,Raj>不会自我感觉更好一些吗
<16-6,Raj>if you were more independent?

373
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,280
<16-7,Stuart>比在他们家蒸汽淋浴里的感觉更好吗
<16-7,Stuart>Better than I feel in their steam shower?

374
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,870
<16-7,Stuart>我觉得不会
<16-7,Stuart>I don't think so.

375
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:56,340
<17-1,Sheldon>佩妮是主菜
<17-1,Sheldon>Penny would be the entree.

376
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:01,060
<17-1,Sheldon>莱纳德算是奶酪盘
<17-1,Sheldon>Then Leonard's basically a cheese course.

377
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:05,640
<17-1,Sheldon>因为我爱你  所以你是甜点
<17-1,Sheldon>And because I love you, you're dessert.

378
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,320
<17-2,Amy>我也想说"好甜蜜"
<17-2,Amy>I want to say "Aw,"

379
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,900
<17-2,Amy>但我要说"好恶心"
<17-2,Amy>but I'm gonna say "Ew."

380
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,020
<17-2,Amy>不  我这样做
<17-2,Amy>No, you see, I'm doing this

381
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:15,610
<18-1,Raj>我就不再是被宠坏的孩子了
<18-1,Raj>so I can stop being spoiled and, you know,

382
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:18,130
<18-1,Raj>成长为一个成年人
<18-1,Raj>grow as a person.

383
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:19,360
<18-2,Stuart>好样的
<18-2,Stuart>Good for you.

384
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,240
<18-2,Stuart>这个三明治里有价值6块钱的火腿
<18-2,Stuart>This sandwich has six dollars worth of ham in it.

385
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:29,320
<18-3,Raj>你在朋友家吃白食  你一点点内疚感都没有吗
<18-3,Raj>Don't you even feel a little bad sponging off your friends?

386
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,840
<18-4,Stuart>我上过艺术学院
<18-4,Stuart>Hey, look, I went to art college,

387
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,900
<18-4,Stuart>我想成为美术设计师
<18-4,Stuart>I tried to make it as a graphic artist,

388
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,170
<18-4,Stuart>漫画家
<18-4,Stuart>a comic book artist,

389
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:36,830
<18-4,Stuart>知道我努力得到了什么吗
<18-4,Stuart>and you know what I got for my efforts?

390
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,890
<18-4,Stuart>瘦骨嶙峋
<18-4,Stuart>A visible rib cage.

391
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,060
<18-4,Stuart>我没开玩笑
<18-4,Stuart>I'm not kidding.

392
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,460
<18-4,Stuart>你可以看到我的心跳
<18-4,Stuart>You could see my heart beating.

393
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:46,080
<18-5,Raj>无意冒犯  但我没上过艺术学院
<18-5,Raj>Well, no offense, but I didn't go to art school.

394
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,540
<18-5,Raj>我有天体物理学的博士学位
<18-5,Raj>I have a PhD in astrophysics.

395
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,820
<18-6,Stuart>很好  流落街头时头上没有屋顶
<18-6,Stuart>Oh, great, it'll be easier for you to look up at the stars

396
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,530
<18-6,Stuart>你观星更容易
<18-6,Stuart>without a roof over your head.

397
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,060
<19-1,Penny>早
<19-1,Penny>Morning.

398
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,220
<19-2,Leonard>你知道拉杰昨晚搬出去了吗
<19-2,Leonard>Did you know Raj moved out last night?

399
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,560
<19-3,Penny>什么  为什么
<19-3,Penny>What? Why?

400
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,250
<19-4,Leonard>"莱纳德和佩妮  抱歉我带来了这么多麻烦
<19-4,Leonard>"Leonard and Penny, I'm sorry for all the trouble I've caused.

401
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,840
<19-4,Leonard>我去霍华德家住
<19-4,Leonard>I went to stay at Howard's.

402
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,630
<19-4,Leonard>另外  小桂子和我在一起
<19-4,Leonard>P.S., Cinnamon's with me,

403
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:08,280
<19-4,Leonard>但如果你们想耍谢尔顿
<19-4,Leonard>But if you feel like messing with Sheldon,

404
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:11,390
<19-4,Leonard>就告诉他  小桂子在楼里走丢了"
<19-4,Leonard>tell him she's loose in the building."

405
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,970
<19-5,Penny>感觉好糟糕啊
<19-5,Penny>I feel terrible.

406
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:16,380
<19-6,Leonard>我们要接他回来吗
<19-6,Leonard>Should we go bring him back?

407
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,540
<19-7,Penny>是你担心有室友
<19-7,Penny>Well, you're the one worried

408
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:20,230
<19-7,Penny>是我们婚姻有问题的表现
<19-7,Penny>having someone live with us is a sign of problems.

409
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:22,790
<19-8,Leonard>那只是因为我妈让我有了这种想法
<19-8,Leonard>Oh, that was just because my mother got in my head.

410
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:26,050
<19-8,Leonard>就好像恶魔上身了  但上身的不是恶魔而是...
<19-8,Leonard>It's like being possessed, but instead of Satan, it's--

411
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:29,400
<19-8,Leonard>其实没差别啦
<19-8,Leonard>Actually, it's the same thing.

412
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:32,260
<19-9,Penny>好的  那我们叫他回来
<19-9,Penny>All right, so we'll ask him to come back.

413
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,700
<19-10,Leonard>很好
<19-10,Leonard>Well, great.

414
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,790
<19-11,Penny>你不先换衣服吗
<19-11,Penny>Don't you want to get dressed first?

415
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,820
<19-12,Leonard>稍等
<19-12,Leonard>Just one second.

416
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,400
<19-12,Leonard>救命  小桂子在楼里走丢了
<19-12,Leonard>Help! Cinnamon's loose in the building!

417
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,240
<19-13,Sheldon (off)>艾米  快  锁门
<19-13,Sheldon (off)>Amy, quick, lock the door!

418
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:56,260
<20-1,Penny>如果我们让你难受真是抱歉
<20-1,Penny>We're so sorry if we made you feel uncomfortable.

419
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,980
<20-1,Penny>我们吵架真不是因为你
<20-1,Penny>We really weren't fighting about you.

420
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:00,370
<20-2,Raj>我只是不想成为朋友的负担
<20-2,Raj>I just never want to be a burden on my friends.

421
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,020
<20-3,Stuart>我也是  不想成为负担
<20-3,Stuart>Me, either. Don't want to be a burden.

422
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:04,380
<20-3,Stuart>是孩子的声音吗  我去看看
<20-3,Stuart>Hey, is that the baby? I'll go check.

423
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,030
<20-4,Leonard>你不是负担
<20-4,Leonard>You are not a burden,

424
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:08,890
<20-4,Leonard>我们希望你回来一起住
<20-4,Leonard>and we want you to come back and stay with us.

425
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:10,320
<20-5,Raj>但我让谢尔顿不高兴
<20-5,Raj>But I also upset Sheldon,

426
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,750
<20-5,Raj>如果我住在那里  他不会去你们家的
<20-5,Raj>and he's not gonna want to come over if I'm there.

427
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,270
<20-6,Penny>这是你更应该来住的原因
<20-6,Penny>More reasons for you to stay.

428
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:18,790
<20-7,Stuart>哈雷没事
<20-7,Stuart>Halley's fine.

429
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:21,750
<20-8,Bernadette>你知道她在我父母家呢吧
<20-8,Bernadette>You know she's at my parents' house, right?

430
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:28,000
<20-9,Stuart>她正享受着人生中最美好的时光
<20-9,Stuart>And she's having the time of her life.

431
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,890
<20-10,Howard>如果你想改变一下
<20-10,Howard>If you ever want to change things up,

432
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:31,760
<20-10,Howard>我家随时欢迎你
<20-10,Howard>you're always welcome here.

433
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,110
<20-11,Bernadette>别来我们卧室就成  白痴
<20-11,Bernadette>Just not in our bedroom, you dumbass.

434
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,730
<20-12,Raj>非常感谢  但我想
<20-12,Raj>I appreciate it, but I think

435
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:42,560
<20-12,Raj>住莱纳德和佩妮家  对大家都更有利
<20-12,Raj>staying with Leonard and Penny makes more sense for everyone.

436
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,420
<20-14,Raj>-就这么定了  -告诉你一声
<20-14,Raj>- Then it's settled. - And just so you know,

437
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,350
<20-14,Raj>这只是暂时的
<20-14,Raj>it's only temporary.

438
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:47,230
<20-14,Raj>我不会太给方便就随便的
<20-14,Raj>I'm not gonna get too comfortable.

439
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,300
<20-14,Raj>很好
<20-14,Raj>Good.

440
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:51,090
<20-15,Bernadette>谁家都不想要一个吃一辈子白食的
<20-15,Bernadette>Nobody needs a mooch living in their house forever.

441
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:54,480
<20-16,Stuart>这样说你家宝宝可不好
<20-16,Stuart>Hey, that's no way to talk about your baby.

442
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,470
<21-1,Sheldon>知道吗  我为我们感到骄傲
<21-1,Sheldon>You know what? I'm proud of us.

443
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:06,460
<21-1,Sheldon>佩妮和莱纳德收留了拉杰
<21-1,Sheldon>Yeah, with Penny and Leonard taking in Raj,

444
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,490
<21-1,Sheldon>斯图尔特住在霍华德和伯纳黛特家
<21-1,Sheldon>and Stuart living with Howard and Bernadette,

445
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:10,710
<21-1,Sheldon>我们是这个小团队中唯一一对
<21-1,Sheldon>we're the only couple of our social group

446
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:11,990
<21-1,Sheldon>不需要用第三者
<21-1,Sheldon>who doesn't need to fill the holes

447
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:14,810
<21-1,Sheldon>填补关系中大坑的人
<21-1,Sheldon>in their relationship with a third party.

448
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:17,950
<21-2,Amy>对  我们完胜
<21-2,Amy>Yup, we're killin' it.
