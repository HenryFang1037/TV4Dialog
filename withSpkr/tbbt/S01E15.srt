<1-1,Leonard>终结生命

<1-4,Raj>Agoraphobia and obsessive compulsive disorder."

11
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:30,760
<1-4,Raj>他们为什么要在这招人?
<1-4,Raj>Why would they be looking for test subjects here?

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,540
<1-5,Leonard>我怎么知道  拉杰
<1-5,Leonard>I don't know, raj.

13
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:36,390
<1-5,Leonard>没准是因为漫画书店没有布告栏
<1-5,Leonard>Maybe the comic book store doesn't have a bulletin board.

18
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:50,530
<1-8,Howard>我认为不是
<1-8,Howard>I don't think so.

19
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:52,430
<1-8,Howard>我从停车场就开始跟着她了
<1-8,Howard>I followed her here from the parking lot.

20
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,250
<1-9,Leonard>可能她是他的律师
<1-9,Leonard>Maybe she's his lawyer.

21

<1-17,Howard>I'm working on a project that may take me up on the next space shuttle.

32
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:29,850
<1-18,Sheldon>为什么要说晚了呢?
<1-18,Sheldon>How can you be late?

33
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:31,510
<1-18,Sheldon>我根本没想要你来
<1-18,Sheldon>I wasn't expecting you at all.

34
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,940
<1-19,Howard>我总是神出鬼没
<1-19,Howard>Nobody ever expects me.

35
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,300
<1-19,Howard>有时你只是看着看着就...
<1-19,Howard>Sometimes you just look and...

<1-21,Sheldon>米茜  这是里奥纳德和拉杰  你已经见过霍华德了
<1-21,Sheldon>Missy, this is leonard and rajesh, and you've already met howard.

40
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:47,530
<1-22,Missy>很高兴见到你们
<1-22,Missy>It's nice to meet you.

<1-26,Missy>他的头可在我的胯下呆过9个月
<1-26,Missy>Oh, he once spent nine months with my legs wrapped around his head.

45
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:02,940
<1-27,Leonard>啊?
<1-27,Leonard>Excuse me?

46
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:05,140
<1-28,Sheldon>她是我的孪生妹妹
<1-28,Sheldon>She's my twin sister.

47
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:08,410
<1-28,Sheldon>她以为自己很风趣  但说实话  我从来看不出
<1-28,Sheldon>She thinks she's funny, but frankly, I've never been able to see it.

48
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:11,480
<1-29,Missy>这是因为你根本无法衡量什么是幽默  谢利(昵称)
<1-29,Missy>That's because you have no measurable sense of humor, shelly.

49
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,090
<1-30,Sheldon>一个人要怎么衡量幽默?
<1-30,Sheldon>How exactly would one measure a sense of humor?

50
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,210
<1-30,Sheldon>幽默测量器?
<1-30,Sheldon>A humormometer?

51
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,140
<1-31,Howard>我觉得你非常得幽默
<1-31,Howard>Well, I think you're delightfully droll.

52
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:26,140
<1-32,Missy>-当然  就像法语中  "你真有趣"  -看我记不记得住
<1-32,Missy>Ooor, as the french say, tres drole. okay, so let me see if I got this.

<1-32,Missy>Leonard, howard and...

54
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,760
<1-32,Missy>不好意思  你叫?
<1-32,Missy>I'm sorry, what was your name again?

55
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,080
<1-33,Sheldon>拉杰
<1-33,Sheldon>Rajesh.

00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,170
<2-1,Leonard>那么  米茜  你为什么从德州跑到这来?
<2-1,Leonard>So, missy, what brings you all the way from texas?

62
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:29,490
<2-2,Howard>是不是缘分?  我觉得是缘分
<2-2,Howard>Was it perhaps destiny? I think it was destiny.

00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,230
<2-3,Missy>我朋友明晚在迪斯尼结婚
<2-3,Missy>My friend's s getting married at disneyland tomorrow night.

64
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:35,310
<2-4,Howard>缘分  名字就叫做阿纳海姆市(美国南加州)
<2-4,Howard>Destiny, thy name is anaheim.

65
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:40,450
<2-5,Missy>我还过来让谢利在父亲的地产文书上签个字
<2-5,Missy>And I had to drop off some papers for shelly to sign for my dad's estate.

66
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:42,010
<2-6,Sheldon>文书可以邮寄的吧
<2-6,Sheldon>The papers could've been mailed.

67
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:44,450
<2-6,Sheldon>妈让你来监视我  没错吧
<2-6,Sheldon>Mom just sent you here to spy on me, didn't she?

68
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:46,690
<2-7,Missy>我想这就是为什么他们要管你叫天才了
<2-7,Missy>I guess that's why they call you a genius.

69
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:49,260
<2-8,Sheldon>他们叫我天才是因为我确实是天才
<2-8,Sheldon>They call me a genius because I'm a genius.

70
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,790
<2-8,Sheldon>告诉妈我目前165磅
<2-8,Sheldon>Tell mom that I currently weigh 165 pounds

71
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:55,450
<2-8,Sheldon>还有我的胃肠蠕动正常
<2-8,Sheldon>And that I'm having regular bowel movements.

72
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,370
<2-8,Sheldon>好好享受婚礼  拜拜
<2-8,Sheldon>Enjoy the wedding. good-bye.

73

<2-10,Leonard>婚礼不是明天吗  不如你今晚来我们这吧?
<2-10,Leonard>If the wedding's not until tomorrow, why don't you stay with us tonight?

74
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:06,050
<2-11,Missy>我看行不通
<2-11,Missy>Oh, I don't think so.

75
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:07,710
<2-11,Missy>谢利不喜欢别人缠着他
<2-11,Missy>Shelly doesn't like company.

76
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,640
<2-11,Missy>即使是在他小时候
<2-11,Missy>Even as a little boy,

77
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,500
<2-11,Missy>他也会在晚上把假想的朋友送回家
<2-11,Missy>He'd send his imaginary friends home at the end of the day.

78
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:13,290
<2-12,Sheldon>他们不是朋友
<2-12,Sheldon>They were not friends.

79
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:15,330
<2-12,Sheldon>他们是假想的同事
<2-12,Sheldon>They were imaginary colleagues.

80
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,180
<2-13,Leonard>你看  你都来了

<2-15,Howard>别这样  谢利  她是家人啊
<2-15,Howard>Come on, shelly. she's family.

<2-16,Sheldon>那又怎么样  我都没有邀请你妈来
<2-16,Sheldon>So what, I don't issue invitations to your mother.

85
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,280
<2-17,Missy>能不用在高峰时段开去阿纳海姆也不错啊
<2-17,Missy>Well, it would be nice not to have to drive to anaheim in rush hour.

86
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,060
<2-18,Sheldon>再也不要叫我谢利
<2-18,Sheldon>And don't ever call me shelly.

87
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,840
<2-19,Leonard>就这么定了  你住我们这儿
<2-19,Leonard>So it's settled. You'll stay with us.

<3-1,Missy>反正

179
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:08,910

<4-41,Leonard>I guess.

180
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,760
<4-42,Sheldon>别担心  我会点那种芝士少一点的
<4-42,Sheldon>Don't worry. I was going to order you cheese-less.

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,990
<4-43,Leonard>-谢谢你  -没事

<4-44,Sheldon>不能吃乳糖不是什么丢脸的事
<4-44,Sheldon>Lactose intolerance is nothing to be embarrassed about.

00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:19,330
<4-45,Howard>我是梦幻印度情人
<4-45,Howard>I'm a fancy indian man.

184
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:20,810
<4-45,Howard>我们发明了睡衣
<4-45,Howard>We invented pajamas.

185
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,080
<4-46,Raj>看我  我没有包皮
<4-46,Raj>Hey, look at me. I don't have a foreskin.

186
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:32,830
<4-46,Raj>谢尔顿...
<4-46,Raj>Sheldon...

187
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:39,050
<5-1,Leonard>你难道没意识到你妹妹魅不可挡吗
<5-1,Leonard>Are you aware that your sister is an incredibly attractive woman?

188
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,260
<5-2,Sheldon>她确实有着西方文化所青睐的
<5-2,Sheldon>She certainly has the symmetry and low

189
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,530
<5-2,Sheldon>既匀称而又低脂肪的身段
<5-2,Sheldon>Body fat that western culture deems desirable.

190
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:48,240
<5-2,Sheldon>这倒是值得注意的  在历史上
<5-2,Sheldon>It's noteworthy, at other points in history,

191
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,130
<5-2,Sheldon>胖一些的女人象征着美丽
<5-2,Sheldon>Heavier women were the standard for

192
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:52,730
<5-2,Sheldon>因为她们的腰身意味着富饶
<5-2,Sheldon>Beauty because their girth suggested affluence.

193
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,010
<5-3,Leonard>很令人着迷  但...
<5-3,Leonard>That's fascinating, but...

194
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:57,350
<5-4,Sheldon>我没有说令人着迷  我只是说值得注意
<5-4,Sheldon>I didn't say it was fascinating. I said it was noteworthy.

195
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,600
<5-5,Leonard>好吧  我注意到了
<5-5,Leonard>All right... noted.

196
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,720
<5-5,Leonard>我的意思是  库萨帕里和沃尔维茨
<5-5,Leonard>But my point is that koothrappali and wolowitz,

197
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,170
<5-5,Leonard>他们在泡你的妹妹啊
<5-5,Leonard>They're hitting on your sister.

198
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:08,650
<5-5,Leonard>这简直...
<5-5,Leonard>Oh, it's...

199
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,130
<5-6,Sheldon>没事啊
<5-6,Sheldon>Oh, okay.

200
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:14,860
<5-6,Sheldon>我不想评价你说话的修辞手法
<5-6,Sheldon>You know, I don't want to criticize your rhetorical style,

201
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,680
<5-6,Sheldon>但要是你能开门见山地说
<5-6,Sheldon>But we'd be a lot further along in this

202
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,870
<5-6,Sheldon>我们可能已经谈得很深了
<5-6,Sheldon>Conversation if you'd begun with that thought.

203
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,230
<5-7,Leonard>-很好  -但是...
<5-7,Leonard>That's great, but my...

204
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:22,440
<5-8,Sheldon>我要说的是  我们拐了个不必要的弯
<5-8,Sheldon>What I'm saying is that we took quite an Unnecessary detour

205
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,110
<5-8,Sheldon>因为现在我发现这才是你的论点
<5-8,Sheldon>from what I now understand to be your thesis.

206
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:25,240
<5-9,Leonard>又怎么了
<5-9,Leonard>Whatever.

207
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,860
<5-9,Leonard>你不能干坐着啊
<5-9,Leonard>You have to do something about it.

208
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:29,950
<5-10,Sheldon>为什么
<5-10,Sheldon>Why?

209
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:31,710
<5-11,Leonard>因为她是你妹妹
<5-11,Leonard>Because she's your sister.

210
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:34,100
<5-11,Leonard>我不明白
<5-11,Leonard>I don't understand.

211
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:36,660
<5-12,Sheldon>不错  我们共同在一个子宫里待过九个月
<5-12,Sheldon>Yes, we shared a uterus for nine months,

212
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:39,900
<5-12,Sheldon>但此后我们就你走阳关道我走独木桥了
<5-12,Sheldon>But since then we've pretty much gone our own separate ways.

213
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:44,200
<5-13,Leonard>好吧  那这么想吧...
<5-13,Leonard>Okay, uh, consider this...

214
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,700
<5-13,Leonard>你父亲去世之后
<5-13,Leonard>With your father gone,

215
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:51,150
<5-13,Leonard>确保米茜能选择一位合适的伴侣就是你的责任了
<5-13,Leonard>It is your responsibility to make sure that missy chooses a suitable mate.

216
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,500
<5-14,Sheldon>我倒没想过这个
<5-14,Sheldon>I hadn't considered that.

217
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,330
<5-14,Sheldon>我们确实有相同的DNA
<5-14,Sheldon>We do share dna. uh-huh.

218
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:59,790
<5-16,Sheldon>所以有这种可能  尽管可能性不大
<5-16,Sheldon>So there is the possibility, however remote,

219
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:02,250
<5-16,Sheldon>她的天赋可以创造另一个
<5-16,Sheldon>That resting in her loins is the potential

220
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:05,060
<5-16,Sheldon>像我这样不平凡的人
<5-16,Sheldon>For another individual as remarkable as myself.

221
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,710
<5-16,Sheldon>正是
<5-16,Sheldon>Exactly.

222
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:11,240
<5-17,Leonard>并且你有责任替你自己和你子孙保留
<5-17,Leonard>And you owe it to yourself and to posterity to protect

223
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,920
<5-17,Leonard>你妹妹所传后代遗传基因的完整性
<5-17,Leonard>The genetic integrity of your sister's future offspring.

224
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,660
<5-17,Leonard>你说的对
<5-17,Leonard>You're right.

225
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,950
<5-18,Sheldon>如果有人想接近米茜的输卵管
<5-18,Sheldon>If someone wants to get at missy's fallopian tubes,

226
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,430
<5-18,Sheldon>他们必须通过我
<5-18,Sheldon>They'll have to go through me.

227
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:34,420
<6-1,Raj>我是摧毁者西瓦(游戏"怒之铁拳"中的BOSS)
<6-1,Raj>I am shiva the destroyer!

228
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,270
<6-1,Raj>我会赢得这个女人
<6-1,Raj>I will have the woman.

229
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:41,280
<6-2,Howard>警告你  我可是数学夏令营的柔道冠军
<6-2,Howard>I'm warning you I was judo champion at math camp.

230
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,800
<6-3,Sheldon>好了  你们幼稚够了吧
<6-3,Sheldon>All right, now that's enough juvenile squabbling.

231
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,740
<6-3,Sheldon>给我停下
<6-3,Sheldon>You stop it.

232
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,500
<6-3,Sheldon>我说给我停下!
<6-3,Sheldon>Stop it, I say!

233
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:49,060
<6-3,Sheldon>我现在就来处理这件事
<6-3,Sheldon>I'm going to settle this right now.

234
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,230
<6-3,Sheldon>你们中的任何一个都配不上我妹妹
<6-3,Sheldon>Neither of you are good enough for my sister.

235
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,770
<6-4,Howard>你是谁  凭什么你决定?
<6-4,Howard>Who are you to decide that?

236
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:55,450
<6-5,Leonard>他是这个家的男人
<6-5,Leonard>He's the man of his family.

237
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:56,920
<6-5,Leonard>你们必须尊重他的意愿
<6-5,Leonard>You have to respect his wishes.

238
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,130
<6-6,Sheldon>-顺便说一句  你也出局了  -你说什么?
<6-6,Sheldon>You're out, too, by the way. say what?

239
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,480
<6-8,Sheldon>我不是针对你
<6-8,Sheldon>It's nothing personal.

240
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,490
<6-8,Sheldon>我只是更希望我将来的侄子或者侄女
<6-8,Sheldon>I'd just prefer if my future niece or nephew

241
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:05,200
<6-8,Sheldon>不要成为那种每次吃到爱斯基摩派就会欢呼雀跃的人
<6-8,Sheldon>Didn't become flatulent every time they ate an eskimo pie.

242
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,940
<6-9,Howard (to Raj, who is smiling)>你高兴个什么劲儿
<6-9,Howard (to Raj, who is smiling)>What are you so happy about?

243
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,120
<6-10,Raj>我不是高兴
<6-10,Raj>I'm not happy.

244
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,510
<6-10,Raj>药起作用了  我停不下来
<6-10,Raj>It's the medication. I can't stop smiling.

245
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:28,240
<6-11,Sheldon>里奥纳德让我意识到遗传基因的赌注有多大
<6-11,Sheldon>That leonard's made me aware of how high the genetic stakes are,

246
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,940
<6-11,Sheldon>我们必须面对现实
<6-11,Sheldon>We have to face the fact that none

247
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:32,000
<6-11,Sheldon>你们没有一个配得上我妹妹
<6-11,Sheldon>Of you are suitable mates for my sister.

248
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:32,840
<6-12,Howard>等一下
<6-12,Howard>Wait a minute.

249
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,010
<6-12,Howard>是里奥纳德让你意识到的?
<6-12,Howard>Leonard made you aware of that?

250
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,320
<6-13,Leonard>我们都会犯错  换个话题吧
<6-13,Leonard>We all make mistakes. let's move on.

251
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:42,050
<6-14,Raj>插一句  不过我认为你错失了一个良机
<6-14,Raj>Excuse me, but I think you're missing a big opportunity here.

252
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:42,940
<6-15,Sheldon>怎么说
<6-15,Sheldon>How so?

253
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:46,520
<6-16,Raj>每个人都知道基因多样化能创造出了不起的后代
<6-16,Raj>Everybody knows genetic diversity produces the strongest offspring.

254
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,860
<6-16,Raj>不如考虑在家庭的拿铁咖啡里放点穆哈调和一下
<6-16,Raj>Why not put a little mocha in the family latte?

255
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:54,460
<6-17,Sheldon>理论上  你说的没错
<6-17,Sheldon>In principle, you have a point.

256
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,730
<6-17,Sheldon>但考虑到实际情况
<6-17,Sheldon>But as a practical matter,

257
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:58,020
<6-17,Sheldon>允许我提醒你一下  你都需要实验性药品
<6-17,Sheldon>Need I remind you that it takes experimental

258
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:01,500
<6-17,Sheldon>才能让你更容易开口跟异性说话
<6-17,Sheldon>Pharmaceuticals to simply enable you to speak to the opposite sex.

259
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:05,180
<6-18,Raj (waving finger at him)>我觉得你把太多的焦点放在药物上了
<6-18,Raj (waving finger at him)>I think you're focusing entirely too much on the drugs.

260
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:12,750
<6-19,Howard>是不是因为我是个犹太人?
<6-19,Howard>Is it 'cause I'm jewish?

261
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,950
<6-19,Howard>要知道为了和你妹妹在一起  我愿意用猪排杀了我的导师
<6-19,Howard>'cause I'd kill my rabbi with a pork chop to be with your sister.

262
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,880
<6-20,Sheldon>这和你的宗教信仰无关
<6-20,Sheldon>This has nothing to do with religion.

263
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,130
<6-20,Sheldon>只是因为你还是个小男孩
<6-20,Sheldon>This has to do with the fact that you're a tiny,

264
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:29,190
<6-20,Sheldon>一个仍和妈妈一起住的小男孩
<6-20,Sheldon>Tiny man who still lives with his mother.

265
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,510
<6-21,Leonard>谢尔顿  你真不讲道理
<6-21,Leonard>Sheldon, you are really being unreasonable.

266
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,110
<6-22,Sheldon>是吗
<6-22,Sheldon>Am i?

267
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:38,030
<6-22,Sheldon>来  吃了这片芝士能不放屁  你就可以和我妹上床
<6-22,Sheldon>Here, eat this cheese without farting and you can sleep with my sister.

268
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,980
<6-23,Missy (who has just entered)>噢  真的吗
<6-23,Missy (who has just entered)>Oh, really?

269
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,430
<6-24,Sheldon>靠
<6-24,Sheldon>Oops.

270
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:49,870
<6-25,Missy>谢利  我可以和你说几句吗
<6-25,Missy>Shelly, can I speak to you for a minute?

271
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,200
<6-26,Sheldon>私下里
<6-26,Sheldon>Alone.

272
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:54,420
<6-26,Sheldon>为什么大家突然都想和我单独谈话
<6-26,Sheldon>Why does everyone suddenly want to talk to me alone?

273
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,800
<6-26,Sheldon>通常没有人喜欢和我单独相处的呀
<6-26,Sheldon>Usually nobody wants to be alone with me.

274
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,950
<6-26,Sheldon>我们都会犯错  换一个话题吧
<6-26,Sheldon>We all make mistakes. let's move on.

275
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:12,200
<7-1,Missy>好吧  我不想过问你为何为了区区芝士把我推销出去
<7-1,Missy>Okay, I'm not even going to ask why you're pimping me out for cheese.

276
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:16,780
<7-1,Missy>不过你何时开始关心我和谁上床了?
<7-1,Missy>But since when do you care at all about who I sleep with?

277
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:19,210
<7-2,Sheldon>说实话  我从来没有考虑过
<7-2,Sheldon>Well, truthfully, I've never given it any thought,

278
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:22,900
<7-2,Sheldon>不过我后来意识到  你身上带着潜在的DNA
<7-2,Sheldon>But it has been pointed out to me that you carry dna of great potential.

279
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,360
<7-3,Missy>你在说些什么鬼话
<7-3,Missy>What on earth are you talking about?

280
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,410
<7-4,Sheldon>让我解释一下
<7-4,Sheldon>Let me explain.

281
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:28,800
<7-4,Sheldon>你知道的  我是个优秀的遗传变异产物
<7-4,Sheldon>You see, I'm a superior genetic mutation, uh,

282
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,500
<7-4,Sheldon>对现有的次品来说存在一个显著提高
<7-4,Sheldon>An improvement on the existing mediocre stock.

283
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:36,800
<7-5,Missy>你说的"次品"是什么意思?
<7-5,Missy>And what do you mean, "mediocre stock"?

284
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,130
<7-6,Sheldon>就是指你
<7-6,Sheldon>That would be you.

285
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:42,790
<7-6,Sheldon>不过在你身体里  有一个潜在的我
<7-6,Sheldon>But residing within you, is the potential for another me.

286
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:47,990
<7-6,Sheldon>一个可能更高  更聪明  雀斑更少的  谢尔顿2.0
<7-6,Sheldon>Perhaps even taller, smarter, and less prone to freckling, a sheldon 2.0,

287
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,190
<7-6,Sheldon>可以这么称呼
<7-6,Sheldon>if you will.

288
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:51,900
<7-7,Missy>"谢尔顿2.0"?
<7-7,Missy>"sheldon 2.0"?

289
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:52,350
<7-7,Missy>正是
<7-7,Missy>Exactly.

290
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:52,550
<7-8,Sheldon>现在
<7-8,Sheldon>Now,

291
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:57,380
<7-8,Sheldon>我不是说我要专横地决定你要和谁在一起
<7-8,Sheldon>I am not saying that I should be the sole decider of who you mate with.

292
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,820
<7-8,Sheldon>如果你不被追求者吸引
<7-8,Sheldon>If you're not attracted to the suitor,

293
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,850
<7-8,Sheldon>那怀孕的可能性就会减少
<7-8,Sheldon>Then the likelihood of conception will be reduced.

294
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:02,620
<7-9,Missy>你开什么玩笑
<7-9,Missy>You have got to be kidding me.

295
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:03,150
<7-10,Sheldon>完全没有
<7-10,Sheldon>Not at all.

296
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:06,700
<7-10,Sheldon>频繁性交会大大增加受精几率
<7-10,Sheldon>Frequent coitus dramatically increases the odds of fertilization.

297
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:10,390
<7-10,Sheldon>好了  谢利  坐下
<7-10,Sheldon>Okay, shelly, sit down.

298
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:17,150
<7-11,Missy>我花了一辈子时间去消化这一事实  我的双胞胎哥哥
<7-11,Missy>Now I've lived my whole life dealing with the fact that my twin

299
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:21,290
<7-11,Missy>像妈妈所说  是个"上帝赐予的特别的小孩"
<7-11,Missy>Brother is, as mom puts it, "one of god's special, little people."

300
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,440
<7-12,Sheldon>我一直认为我更像一只布谷鸟
<7-12,Sheldon>I always thought I was more like a cuckoo bird.

301
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:24,870
<7-12,Sheldon>你知道的
<7-12,Sheldon>You know,

302
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:28,770
<7-12,Sheldon>一种把蛋放在普通鸟巢里的了不起的生物
<7-12,Sheldon>A superior creature whose egg is placed in the nest of ordinary birds.

303
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:31,190
<7-12,Sheldon>当然  先孵化出的布谷鸟会吃掉所有的食物
<7-12,Sheldon>Of course, the newly hatched cuckoo eats all the food,

304
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:33,470
<7-12,Sheldon>留下其他普通的兄弟姐妹们饿死
<7-12,Sheldon>Leaving the ordinary siblings to starve to death.

305
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,980
<7-12,Sheldon>你很幸运  这就是我使用这比喻想要说的
<7-12,Sheldon>Luckily for you, that's where the metaphor ended.

306
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:40,900
<7-13,Missy>我还以为你是想说"布谷"
<7-13,Missy>I thought it ended at "cuckoo."

307
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,960
<7-13,Missy>你听好
<7-13,Missy>You listen to me.

308
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,890
<7-13,Missy>如果你想做一个关心妹妹的好哥哥
<7-13,Missy>If you want to start acting like a brother who cares about me,

309
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:48,620
<7-13,Missy>那太好了
<7-13,Missy>Then terrific.

310
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,250
<7-13,Missy>尽管来做
<7-13,Missy>Bring it on.

311
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:52,890
<7-13,Missy>但只要你有一次想告诉我该和谁上床
<7-13,Missy>But you try one time to tell me who I should be sleeping with,

312
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:54,550
<7-13,Missy>我就得跟你回顾回顾
<7-13,Missy>And you and I are going to go round and

313
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:56,340
<7-13,Missy>我们小时候的那种方式了
<7-13,Missy>Round the way we did when we were little.

314
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,620
<7-13,Missy>没忘吧?
<7-13,Missy>Remember?

315
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:04,530
<7-14,Sheldon>-我有另外个提议  -说
<7-14,Sheldon>I have an alternate proposal. go on.

316
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,980
<7-16,Sheldon>你捐出卵子
<7-16,Sheldon>You donate eggs.

317
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,890
<7-16,Sheldon>我们把它放去低温储藏
<7-16,Sheldon>We will place them in cryogenic storage.

318
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:10,990
<7-16,Sheldon>我会帮你的卵子找一个合格的精子
<7-16,Sheldon>I will find an appropriate sperm donor for your eggs,

319
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:13,630
<7-16,Sheldon>等他们完成受精后再植入你的体内
<7-16,Sheldon>Have them fertilized and implanted in you.

320
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,360
<7-16,Sheldon>这样  对每个人都好
<7-16,Sheldon>That way, everybody wins.

321
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,560
<8-1,Sheldon>更正下
<8-1,Sheldon>Correction.

322
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,770
<8-1,Sheldon>米茜想跟谁约会不关我的事
<8-1,Sheldon>Missy can date whoever she wants.

323
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:31,470
<8-1,Sheldon>我们得想办法解决下
<8-1,Sheldon>Look, we have to settle this.

324
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:32,630
<9-1,Howard>我同意
<9-1,Howard>I agree.

325
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,460
<9-2,Leonard>谢尔顿的妹妹躲在潘妮家里
<9-2,Leonard>Sheldon's sister is hiding at penny's because

326
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,420
<9-2,Leonard>是因为我们在同一时间向她发起攻击
<9-2,Leonard>We've all been hitting on her at the same time.

327
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,760
<9-3,Raj>她才没躲呢
<9-3,Raj>She's not hiding.

328
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,950
<9-3,Raj>她得留点私人空间来打电话给她生病的奶奶
<9-3,Raj>She needed privacy to call her grandmother who's apparently very sick.

329
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:42,850
<9-3,Raj>我想她还得洗她的头发
<9-3,Raj>Oh, and then I believe she has to wash her hair.

330
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,720
<9-4,Howard>你这个傻混蛋
<9-4,Howard>Oh, you poor, deluded bastard.

331
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:48,250
<9-5,Raj>别跟我来劲  你这家伙
<9-5,Raj>Don't start with me, dude.

332
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,510
<9-6,Howard>你还想再来?  来啊
<9-6,Howard>You want to go again? let's go.

333
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:50,950
<9-7,Leonard>-坐下  -好吧
<9-7,Leonard>Sit down. okay.

334
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:55,080
<9-9,Leonard>如果我们想争米茜  我们来好好地争
<9-9,Leonard>If we're going to fight over missy, let's do it the right way.

335
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,720
<9-9,Leonard>有尊严地争
<9-9,Leonard>The honorable way.

336
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:00,160
<9-10,Leonard>吃我一拳!
<9-10,Leonard>Take that!

337
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,550
<9-10,Leonard>还想再来?
<9-10,Leonard>You want some more?

338
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:06,600
<9-10,Leonard>他倒下了!
<9-10,Leonard>And he's down!

339
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:09,790
<9-10,Leonard>1  2  3
<9-10,Leonard>One, two, three...

340
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,600
<9-11,Howard>来啊  快起来啊
<9-11,Howard>Come on, come on! get up!

341
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,960
<9-12,Leonard>乖乖躺着吧  婊子
<9-12,Leonard>Stay down, bitch!

342
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:16,710
<9-12,Leonard>9  10
<9-12,Leonard>...nine, ten.

343
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:20,670
<9-12,Leonard>上帝的选择是正确的
<9-12,Leonard>Yeah! natural selection at work.

344
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:22,430
<9-13,Sheldon>为人类感到悲哀
<9-13,Sheldon>I weep for humanity.

345
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,760
<9-14,Leonard>失陪  我得去告诉米茜这个好消息
<9-14,Leonard>Excuse me while I go tell missy the good news.

346
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:34,230
<9-15,Penny (answering)>-好啊  里奥纳德  -好啊  潘妮
<9-15,Penny (answering)>Hey, leonard. oh, hi, penny.

347
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:34,770
<9-16,Leonard>还不错吧
<9-16,Leonard>How's it going?
