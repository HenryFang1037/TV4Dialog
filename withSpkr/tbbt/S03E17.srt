1
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:06,020
<1-1,Leonard>为什么我总是出力
<1-1,Leonard>Why do I always have to carry the heavy stuff?

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:07,850
<1-2,Sheldon>很简单啊
<1-2,Sheldon>Well, it's very simple.

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:10,950
<1-2,Sheldon>在我们这群一无所有的破烂科学家当中
<1-2,Sheldon>In our ragtag band of scientists with nothing to lose,

4
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:12,390
<1-2,Sheldon>我负责动脑子
<1-2,Sheldon>I'm the smart one,

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:13,750
<1-2,Sheldon>沃罗威茨负责搞笑
<1-2,Sheldon>Wolowitz is the funny one,

6
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:15,850
<1-2,Sheldon>库萨帕里是一个奋力想要融入我们的生活
<1-2,Sheldon>and Koothrappali is the lovable foreigner

7
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,350
<1-2,Sheldon>但是以失败告终的可爱的老外
<1-2,Sheldon>who struggles to understand our ways and fails.

8
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:23,090
<1-2,Sheldon>你别无选择  只有肌肉男了
<1-2,Sheldon>That leaves you, by default, as the muscle.

9
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,450
<1-3,Leonard>再多搬一层  我就肌肉难了
<1-3,Leonard>One more floor, and I'd be the pulled muscle.

10
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:31,050
<1-4,Penny (who is inside the apartment)>来的正好 我要饿死了
<1-4,Penny (who is inside the apartment)>Oh, it's about time. I'm starving.

11
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:33,620
<1-5,Leonard>这个  其实我们没带中国菜回来
<1-5,Leonard>Um, well, we didn't actually get Chinese food.

12
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:36,250
<1-7,Leonard>-为什么啊  -淡定 这个更赞
<1-7,Leonard>- Why not?  - Don't panic. This is better.

13
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:39,750
<1-8,Penny>不是吧 你们不会用食物换了魔豆吧
<1-8,Penny>Oh, no. You didn't trade the food for magic beans, did you?

14
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,390
<1-9,Sheldon>当然没有
<1-9,Sheldon>Of course not.

15
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,250
<1-9,Sheldon>况且严格来说  魔豆也是食物
<1-9,Sheldon>And technically, magic beans would be food.

16
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:46,390
<1-9,Sheldon>虽然吃了它们怪浪费的
<1-9,Sheldon>Although eating them would be quite a waste,

17
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:47,750
<1-9,Sheldon>因为你可以种植它们
<1-9,Sheldon>since you could plant them,

18
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,320
<1-9,Sheldon>然后一夜之间  就会长成一株巨大的豆茎
<1-9,Sheldon>and overnight, have a giant beanstalk,

19
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,220
<1-9,Sheldon>足够一个小城市吃的
<1-9,Sheldon>which would provide enough roughage for a small city.

20
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,450
<1-10,Penny>其实有时候我根本没听你说话
<1-10,Penny>Yeah, sometimes I don't listen.

21
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:57,150
<1-10,Penny>只是看着你的下巴一上一下
<1-10,Penny>Sometimes I just watch your jaw go up and down.

22
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:00,320
<1-11,Leonard>我们去中餐馆的路上
<1-11,Leonard>We were on our way to the Chinese restaurant

23
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:01,620
<1-11,Leonard>貌似看见了亚当·韦斯特
<1-11,Leonard>when we thought we saw Adam West,

25
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:02,690
<1-11,Leonard>所以我们就跟着他走
<1-11,Leonard>so we followed him.

26
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,820
<1-12,Penny>谁是亚当·韦斯特
<1-12,Penny>Who's Adam West?

27
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:06,020
<1-12,Penny>谁是亚当·韦斯特
<1-12,Penny>Who's Adam West?!

28
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:09,320
<1-13,Sheldon>莱纳德  你们性交之后都聊些什么啊
<1-13,Sheldon>Leonard, what do the two of you talk about after the coitus?

29
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:14,520
<1-14,Howard>我猜是  "哇塞  4分钟  新纪录啊"
<1-14,Howard>My guess is, "Hey, four minutes! New record!"

30
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,650
<1-14,Howard>所以我才负责搞笑啊
<1-14,Howard>That's why I'm the funny one.

31
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:22,120
<1-15,Leonard>反正呢  我们跟着他到了旧货出售摊儿
<1-15,Leonard>Anyway, we followed the guy to this garage sale,

32
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:23,690
<1-15,Leonard>那卖的东西都超赞
<1-15,Leonard>and they had the coolest stuff.

33
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,790
<1-16,Howard>他们正好关门大甩卖
<1-16,Howard>They were closing up.

34
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,650
<1-16,Howard>这一箱子东西才60块
<1-16,Howard>We got this whole box for 60 bucks.

35
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:28,050
<1-17,Leonard>我们还没来得及看清都有什么呢
<1-17,Leonard>We didn't even get to go through it all.

36
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:29,350
<1-17,Leonard>说不定有什么宝贝呢
<1-17,Leonard>There could be anything in here.

37
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:32,120
<1-18,Penny>看看有没有新女朋友 说不定你需要一个
<1-18,Penny>There a new girlfriend in there? 'Cause you might need one.

38
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:33,950
<1-18,Penny>没有
<1-18,Penny>No.

39
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:37,320
<1-19,Leonard>不过有《捉鬼敢死队》的原版终稿
<1-19,Leonard>But there is an original final draft Ghostbusters script

40
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,050
<1-19,Leonard>上面真的有黏液的污迹哎
<1-19,Leonard>with actual slime stains!

41
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:41,550
<1-19,Leonard>你说得对
<1-19,Leonard>Oh, you're right.

42
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:42,790
<1-19,Leonard>这个是《捉鬼敢死队2》
<1-19,Leonard>It's Ghostbusters 2.

43
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,050
<1-19,Leonard>没看头
<1-19,Leonard>Never mind.

44
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,500
<1-20,Howard>我滴神啊
<1-20,Howard>Oh, my God.

45
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:53,030
<1-20,Howard>是阿福娃娃
<1-20,Howard>An Alf doll.

46
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:56,380
<1-20,Howard>我11岁时  我妈在我爸去世后
<1-20,Howard>When I was 11, my mother got me one

47
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,660
<1-20,Howard>给我买了一个 让我能睡好觉
<1-20,Howard>to help me sleep after my dad left.

48
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:02,900
<1-20,Howard>我那时候会假装 爸爸是去了蜜胺树脂星球
<1-20,Howard>I used to pretend that my dad had moved to the planet Melmac,

49
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:07,330
<1-20,Howard>而阿福会把他带回我身边的
<1-20,Howard>and Alf was going to bring him back to me.

50
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,630
<1-20,Howard>但它从来也没有
<1-20,Howard>But he never did.

53
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,360
<1-21,Penny>太伤感了
<1-21,Penny>That is so sad.

54
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,560
<1-22,Sheldon>不  更伤感的是你居然不知道
<1-22,Sheldon>No, what's sad is that you don't know

<2-6,Raj>And an Aquaman action figure.

68
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:30,200
<2-7,Howard>好像有人给他画了个小弟弟
<2-7,Howard>Looks like someone drew a penis on him.

<2-8,Raj>没事儿  看我擦掉
<2-8,Raj>Ooh, that'll come off.

71
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:46,070
<2-9,Howard>停下
<2-9,Howard>Stop that.

72
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,330
<2-10,Sheldon>真赞啊
<2-10,Sheldon>Fascinating.

73
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:48,770
<2-11,Leonard>什么东西
<2-11,Leonard>What?

74
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,200
<2-12,Sheldon>是《魔戒》里的魔戒
<2-12,Sheldon>It appears to be a Lord of the Rings ring.

75
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:52,700
<2-13,Leonard>上面居然还刻着
<2-13,Leonard>Oh. It's even got

76
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,270
<2-14,Raj>精灵语呢
<2-14,Raj>the Elvish engraving on it.

77
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,600
<2-15,Sheldon>不是精灵语
<2-15,Sheldon>It's not Elvish.

78
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:58,830
<2-15,Sheldon>是用精灵语的字母写的魔多语
<2-15,Sheldon>It's the language of Mordor written in Elvish script.

79
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:03,000
<2-15,Sheldon>"魔戒全属至尊御"
<2-15,Sheldon>"One Ring to rule them all."

81
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,600
<2-16,Raj>"至尊指引诸魔戒"
<2-16,Raj>"One Ring to find them."

82
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:08,200
<2-17,Howard>"至尊魔戒唤众戒"
<2-17,Howard>"One Ring to bring them all."

83
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:11,730
<2-18,Leonard>"众戒归一黑暗中"
<2-18,Leonard>"And in the darkness bind them."

84
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,700
<2-19,Raj>我靠  咱们好宅啊
<2-19,Raj>Holy crap, are we nerdy.

85
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,030
<3-1,Howard>我调查了一下这个魔戒
<3-1,Howard>So, I was doing some checking on the ring.

86
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:22,270
<3-2,Raj>等下  谢尔顿  那边桌子上的是番茄酱吗
<3-2,Raj>Hold on. Sheldon, is there ketchup on that table?

87
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,530
<3-3,Sheldon>是滴
<3-3,Sheldon>Yes, there is.

88
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:29,100
<3-3,Sheldon>有个好玩的事儿 起初 番茄酱是酱汁的总称
<3-3,Sheldon>Oh, here's a fun fact. Ketchup started out as a general term for sauce,

89
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:32,400
<3-3,Sheldon>特别是那些加了草本植物和香料的 蘑菇或腌鱼
<3-3,Sheldon>typically made of mushrooms or fish brine with herbs and spices.

90
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:35,130
<3-3,Sheldon>早期流行的主材料包括蓝莓
<3-3,Sheldon>Some popular early main ingredients included blueberry,

91
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:38,630
<3-3,Sheldon>凤尾鱼  牡蛎  四季豆  还有葡萄
<3-3,Sheldon>anchovy, oyster, kidney bean and grape.

92
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:42,600
<3-4,Raj>没事儿  我去拿
<3-4,Raj>No, that's okay. I'll get it.

93
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:47,200
<3-5,Howard>听我说  我仔细观察了魔戒 看上去有点奇怪
<3-5,Howard>Listen, I was looking at the ring, and it seemed a little weird.

94
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:48,770
<3-5,Howard>上面竟然没有版权声明
<3-5,Howard>No copyright notice on it.

95
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,300
<3-5,Howard>所以我就拿给我一个哥们儿看  这么说吧
<3-5,Howard>So, I took it down to this buddy of mine who deals with--

96
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:55,900
<3-5,Howard>他专门和收藏界的黑市 做交易
<3-5,Howard>shall we say-- the seedy underbelly of the collectibles world.

97
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,370
<3-6,Leonard>黑市
<3-6,Leonard>Seedy underbelly?

98
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,730
<3-7,Howard>你那个黑市淘来的手提式相位枪
<3-7,Howard>You know, your black market phasers,

100
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:01,900
<3-7,Howard>还有乌拉中尉在电影中穿过的内裤
<3-7,Howard>your screen-worn Lieutenant Uhura panties,

101
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:03,270
<3-7,Howard>就那些东西呗
<3-7,Howard>that kind of stuff.

102
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,470
<3-8,Raj>你这个神秘兄弟是谁
<3-8,Raj>Who's this mysterious buddy you suddenly have?

103
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,530
<3-9,Howard>就是我认识的一个家伙
<3-9,Howard>Just a guy. I know a guy.

104
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:12,230
<3-11,Howard>-艾迪·克里斯波吗  -我不能告诉你  别问了
<3-11,Howard>- Is it Eddie Crispo? - No, I can't tell you who it is. Stop asking.

105
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,870
<3-12,Raj>还能是谁  肯定是艾迪·克里斯波
<3-12,Raj>Who else could it be? It has to be Eddie Crispo.

106
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,970
<3-13,Howard>我认识很多黑道人物  好不好
<3-13,Howard>I know lots of dangerous people, okay?

107
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,030
<3-14,Raj>-说一个  -艾迪·克里斯波
<3-14,Raj>- Name one. - Eddie Crispo.

108
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:25,170
<3-15,Howard>不管怎样 他说这个不是仿品 而是真品
<3-15,Howard>Anyway, he said this isn't a replica. It's the real deal.

109
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,130
<3-16,Sheldon>如果你说这就是索伦在末日火山
<3-16,Sheldon>If you're suggesting that that is the actual ring of power

110
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:30,400
<3-16,Sheldon>打造的至尊魔戒[指环王情节]
<3-16,Sheldon>forged by Sauron in Mount Doom,

111
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,830
<3-16,Sheldon>我会用极为不屑和
<3-16,Sheldon>I look at you with an expression of exhaustion

112
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,870
<3-16,Sheldon>嘲笑的表情看着你
<3-16,Sheldon>and ever so slight amusement.

113
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:40,830
<3-17,Leonard>他不是说这是魔戒
<3-17,Leonard>He's not saying it's a magic ring.

114
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:42,770
<3-17,Leonard>对吧
<3-17,Leonard>You're not, are you?

115
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,800
<3-17,Leonard>没错  但差不多
<3-17,Leonard>No, but it's close.

116
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,300
<3-18,Howard>看里面的标记
<3-18,Howard>Look at the markings inside.

117
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:48,600
<3-18,Howard>那是生产标记
<3-18,Howard>Those are production markings.

118
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:51,570
<3-18,Howard>为拍摄《指环王》  共打造了九枚戒指
<3-18,Howard>Nine rings were made for use in the Lord of the Rings movies.

119
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,400
<3-18,Howard>三枚送给了剧中演员
<3-18,Howard>Three were given to members of the cast.

120
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,870
<3-18,Howard>剩下的都被销毁了
<3-18,Howard>The rest were destroyed.

121
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,630
<3-18,Howard>除了一枚
<3-18,Howard>Except one.

122
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:59,370
<3-18,Howard>被偷的一枚
<3-18,Howard>One was stolen.

123
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,430
<3-18,Howard>先生们
<3-18,Howard>Gentlemen...

124
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:05,000
<3-18,Howard>这就是至尊魔戒
<3-18,Howard>this is the one ring.

125
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,830
<3-19,Sheldon (snatching it)>归我了
<3-19,Sheldon (snatching it)>Mine!

126
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,430
<3-20,Leonard>不  不是你的
<3-20,Leonard>No, it is not yours.

127
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,070
<3-20,Leonard>我们一起去要的箱子
<3-20,Leonard>We all went in on the box together.

128
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,400
<3-21,Sheldon>对  但是我在箱子里找到的
<3-21,Sheldon>Well, yes, but I found it in the box,

129
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,500
<3-21,Sheldon>海难救助法明确规定
<3-21,Sheldon>and the laws of maritime salvage clearly state

130
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:20,400
<3-21,Sheldon>找到沉海宝藏的人
<3-21,Sheldon>that the finder of a sunken treasure

131
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,000
<3-21,Sheldon>即视为宝藏的主人
<3-21,Sheldon>is the owner of the treasure.

132
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:23,900
<3-22,Leonard>这怎么符合海难救助法
<3-22,Leonard>How is this maritime salvage?

133
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:26,330
<3-23,Sheldon>除了没有水  怎么不符合
<3-23,Sheldon>Other than the lack of water, how is it not?

134
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:28,870
<3-24,Raj>等等  谢尔顿  先别发疯
<3-24,Raj>Wait, wait. Sheldon, stop being crazy for a second.

135
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,070
<3-24,Raj>这种东西值多少钱
<3-24,Raj>How much is something like this worth?

136
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,700
<3-25,Howard>这么抢手的东西很难估价
<3-25,Howard>Well, it's tough to say since it's hot,

137
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:35,800
<3-25,Howard>不过在黑市里  我朋友估价
<3-25,Howard>but on the underground market, my guy figures...

138
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:36,830
<3-26,Raj>你是指艾迪·克里斯波吧
<3-26,Raj>Your guy Eddie Crispo?

139
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:39,030
<3-27,Howard>是滴
<3-27,Howard>Yes.

140
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:44,900
<3-27,Howard>他估价一万到一万五
<3-27,Howard>He figures ten, maybe 15 thousand.

141
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:46,400
<3-28,Raj>既然值这么多钱
<3-28,Raj>Okay, that's a lot of money.

142
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:49,530
<3-28,Raj>明智之举是用它投资更实用的东西
<3-28,Raj>The wise thing to do is invest it in something practical.

143
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:51,270
<3-29,Howard>比如水上摩托艇
<3-29,Howard>Like a jet ski.

144
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,230
<3-29,Howard>你要摩托艇干嘛
<3-29,Howard>Why do you want a jet ski?

145
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:57,570
<3-30,Raj>电影里有钱又帅的人都骑摩托艇
<3-30,Raj>All the wealthy and beautiful people in movies ride Jet Skis.

146
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,370
<3-30,Raj>这不可能是巧合
<3-30,Raj>That can't just be a coincidence.

147
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,470
<3-31,Sheldon>我们不能卖它
<3-31,Sheldon>We can't sell it.

148
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,070
<3-31,Sheldon>要保存它
<3-31,Sheldon>We have to keep it

149
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,400
<3-31,Sheldon>珍惜它  爱护它
<3-31,Sheldon>and love it and polish it,

150
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,870
<3-31,Sheldon>只能偶尔拿出来
<3-31,Sheldon>and only take it out occasionally

151
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,200
<3-31,Sheldon>去公园里
<3-31,Sheldon>when we go to the park

152
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:10,200
<3-31,Sheldon>重演电影里喜欢的场景
<3-31,Sheldon>and reenact our favorite scenes from the movies.

153
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:14,270
<3-32,Howard>听着有意思  其实很无聊
<3-32,Howard>It's sad how great that sounds.

154
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,470
<3-33,Leonard>各位  这是偷来的
<3-33,Leonard>Guys, it's stolen.

155
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,100
<3-33,Leonard>应该还给彼得·杰克逊[指环王导演]
<3-33,Leonard>It should go back to Peter Jackson.

156
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:18,930
<3-33,Leonard>他制作的电影  魔戒应该属于他
<3-33,Leonard>He made the movies; it belongs to him.

157
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:20,130
<3-33,Leonard>行啊
<3-33,Leonard>Fine.

158
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:22,500
<3-34,Howard>可以换给他  只要他答应
<3-34,Howard>He can have it back as long as he promises

159
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:24,770
<3-34,Howard>让我演下一部电影里的霍比特人
<3-34,Howard>to make me a hobbit in his next movie.

160
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,870
<3-35,Raj>没有犹太霍比特人
<3-35,Raj>There are no Jewish hobbits.

161
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,730
<3-36,Howard>显然你没在岁首节[犹太新年]
<3-36,Howard>Clearly, you've never been to my house

162
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:31,000
<3-36,Howard>来我家吃饭
<3-36,Howard>for dinner on Rosh Hashanah.

163
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:33,400
<3-37,Leonard>我们不能敲诈彼得·杰
<3-37,Leonard>We are not blackmailing Peter J...

164
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:34,900
<3-37,Leonard>够了  魔戒哪去了
<3-37,Leonard>All right, where's the ring?

165
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:37,200
<3-38,Sheldon>你是说我的魔戒吗
<3-38,Sheldon>You mean my ring?

166
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:38,300
<3-39,Leonard>你这是干嘛
<3-39,Leonard>What are you doing?

167
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:39,470
<3-40,Sheldon>魔戒无人看护
<3-40,Sheldon>The ring was unguarded.

168
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,230
<3-40,Sheldon>就这么放着台面
<3-40,Sheldon>It was just sitting on the table.

169
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,700
<3-40,Sheldon>谁都能拿走
<3-40,Sheldon>Anyone could have taken it.

170
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:44,630
<3-40,Sheldon>证据  我拿了
<3-40,Sheldon>Proof? I did.

171
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:47,200
<3-41,Leonard>-给我  -大家理智点
<3-41,Leonard>- Give me that. - Look, let's be reasonable.

172
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:49,570
<3-42,Raj>我们都对魔戒抱有不同的想法
<3-42,Raj>We all want to do different things with the ring,

173
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,500
<3-42,Raj>但你们的想法太傻  我要的可是摩托艇
<3-42,Raj>but your ideas are stupid, and I want a jet ski.

174
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:54,230
<3-43,Sheldon>我找到的  魔戒是我的
<3-43,Sheldon>I found it. The ring is mine.

175
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:57,570
<3-43,Sheldon>我不明白  为啥每次都不能我说了算
<3-43,Sheldon>I don't understand why in this group I never get my way.

176
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:04,130
<3-44,Leonard>有哪次不是你说了算
<3-44,Leonard>You always get your way.

177
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:08,430
<3-45,Sheldon>你把魔戒给我  才是每次我说了算
<3-45,Sheldon>I'll stipulate to that if you give me the ring.

178
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,600
<3-46,Penny>各位
<3-46,Penny>Hey, guys.

179
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:10,970
<3-46,Penny>喜欢我给你们上的
<3-46,Penny>Enjoying your food that I actually

180
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,630
<3-46,Penny>不是你们点的菜
<3-46,Penny>brought you instead of promising food,

181
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:15,770
<3-46,Penny>是我随意找的一堆垃圾
<3-46,Penny>but bringing you a box of random crap?

182
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,900
<3-47,Leonard>很好吃
<3-47,Leonard>Yeah, it's delicious.

183
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,730
<3-47,Leonard>就是讽刺的话不太新鲜
<3-47,Leonard>The sarcasm's a little stale, though.

184
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,030
<3-47,Leonard>要不这样吧
<3-47,Leonard>Hey, how about this?

185
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,900
<3-47,Leonard>确定如何处理魔戒前
<3-47,Leonard>Until we figure out what to do with the ring,

186
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:24,070
<3-47,Leonard>由佩妮来保管
<3-47,Leonard>Penny holds on to it.

187
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:24,970
<3-48,Penny>什么戒指
<3-48,Penny>What ring?

188
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,130
<3-49,Leonard>这枚戒指
<3-49,Leonard>This ring.

189
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:29,300
<3-50,Sheldon>在找东西吗
<3-50,Sheldon>Looking for something?

190
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:33,830
<3-51,Leonard>你能保管几天吗
<3-51,Leonard>Will you hold on to this for a couple of days?

191
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:35,470
<3-53,Leonard>-为什么  -这是部电影的道具
<3-53,Leonard>- Why? - It's a prop from a movie,

192
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,430
<3-53,Leonard>我们正为此争吵呢
<3-53,Leonard>And we're kind of fighting over it.

193
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:39,130
<3-54,Penny>只想说清楚  我男朋友给我的
<3-54,Penny>Okay, just to be clear, the first piece of jewelry

194
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:40,870
<3-54,Penny>第一件珠宝是电影里的道具
<3-54,Penny>my boyfriend gives me is a prop from a movie,

195
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,370
<3-54,Penny>而且我还不能拥有它
<3-54,Penny>and I don't even get to keep it?

196
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,070
<3-55,Howard>如果你三年前跟了我
<3-55,Howard>If you had gone out with me three years ago,

197
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,500
<3-55,Howard>你现在应该能收到我姑婆艾达
<3-55,Howard>by now, you'd have my great Aunt Ida's brooch

198
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:52,070
<3-55,Howard>塞进猫肚子从德占比利时偷运出的胸针
<3-55,Howard>that she smuggled out of occupied Belgium in a cat.

199
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,370
<3-56,Leonard>现在感觉我还好吧
<3-56,Leonard>How am I looking now?

200
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,330
<4-1,Sheldon>你打我
<4-1,Sheldon>You hit me!

201
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:03,530
<4-1,Sheldon>我在流血
<4-1,Sheldon>I'm bleeding!

202
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,230
<4-2,Leonard>什么情况
<4-2,Leonard>What was that?

203
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:08,500
<4-3,Penny>谢尔顿想偷魔戒  我给了他一拳
<4-3,Penny>Sheldon tried to take the ring and I punched him.

204
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,900
<4-4,Leonard>干得好
<4-4,Leonard>That's my girl.

205
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:20,000
<5-1,Howard>谢尔顿啊
<5-1,Howard>So, Sheldon,

206
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,160
<5-1,Howard>被一个女人家揍的感觉如何
<5-1,Howard>how's it feel to get beaten up by a girl?

207
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,960
<5-2,Sheldon>反正不是第一次了
<5-2,Sheldon>It's not the first time.

208
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,400
<5-2,Sheldon>在子宫里我那胞姐就开始欺负我
<5-2,Sheldon>I have a twin sister whose assaults began in utero.

209
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,530
<5-2,Sheldon>如果当年我能一直坚定的吸收掉她
<5-2,Sheldon>If only I'd had the presence of mind to reabsorb her,

210
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,560
<5-2,Sheldon>我也就多了一颗长毛的痣
<5-2,Sheldon>then I'd have a mole with hair in it

211
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,000
<5-2,Sheldon>这样也不会收到那些无聊的圣诞贺卡了
<5-2,Sheldon>instead of a tedious yearly Christmas letter.

212
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,930
<5-3,Raj>先生们  你们还没有觉悟吗
<5-3,Raj>Gentlemen, have you come to the realization

213
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:44,770
<5-3,Raj>最明智的选择
<5-3,Raj>that the only reasonable course of action

214
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,570
<5-3,Raj>就是卖了魔戒再分钱
<5-3,Raj>is to sell the ring and divide the money?

215
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,730
<5-4,Leonard>没门
<5-4,Leonard>No.

216
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:48,800
<5-5,Raj>我就怕你这么说
<5-5,Raj>I was afraid of that.

217
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,800
<5-5,Raj>说吧
<5-5,Raj>Go ahead.

218
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:54,430
<5-6,Man on Screen>在孟买问候大家
<5-6,Man on Screen>Greetings from Mumbai.

219
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:56,930
<5-6,Man on Screen>我是拉杰的律师  文卡塔斯·库萨帕里
<5-6,Man on Screen>I am Raj's attorney, Venkatesh Koothrappali.

220
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:58,970
<5-7,Raj>也是我表哥
<5-7,Raj>Also my cousin.

221
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,430
<5-8,Howard>你居然还找了个律师
<5-8,Howard>You brought a lawyer?

222
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:01,670
<5-9,Venkatesh>这个不用回答
<5-9,Venkatesh>Don't answer that.

223
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,830
<5-9,Venkatesh>我就直说了
<5-9,Venkatesh>I'll get straight to the point.

224
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,870
<5-9,Venkatesh>我的委托人准备放弃
<5-9,Venkatesh>My client's prepared to surrender

225
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,330
<5-9,Venkatesh>他在这枚魔戒上的一切利益
<5-9,Venkatesh>any interest he has in the ring

226
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:10,070
<5-9,Venkatesh>来交换两辆川崎水上摩托
<5-9,Venkatesh>in exchange for two Kawasaki Jet Skis.

227
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:13,100
<5-10,Leonard>两辆水上摩托是不可能的
<5-10,Leonard>We're not giving him two Jet Skis.

228
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,530
<5-10,Leonard>听着  大家都成年人了
<5-10,Leonard>Look, we're big boys,

229
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:17,230
<5-10,Leonard>我们何不都退一步海阔天空呢
<5-10,Leonard>why don't we just cut to the chase and meet in the middle?

230
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:19,670
<5-10,Leonard>一辆水上摩托就够了 怎么样
<5-10,Leonard>One Kawasaki Jet Ski. Done and done.

231
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:24,300
<6-1,Leonard>半辆都不给
<6-1,Leonard>No Jet Skis.

232
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,730
<6-2,Venkatesh>好吧  不谈水上摩托了
<6-2,Venkatesh>All right, forget the Jet Skis.

233
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:29,500
<6-3,Raj>你说什么 这是我们的底线
<6-3,Raj>Forget the Jet Skis? That was our line in the sand!

234
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:31,400
<6-3,Raj>你就这点招数吗
<6-3,Raj>What happened to "tear them a new one?"

235
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:35,230
<6-4,Venkatesh>那你要我怎样 他们态度强硬 我们输了
<6-4,Venkatesh>What can I say? They played hardball. We lost.

236
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,570
<6-5,Raj>你这没用的东西
<6-5,Raj>You're useless.

237
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,400
<6-6,Venkatesh>你来雇我时我就说了
<6-6,Venkatesh>I told you that when you hired me.

238
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:39,870
<6-7,Raj>我要下线了

<8-34,Sheldon>等等  先说清楚
<8-34,Sheldon>Wait, just to clarify.

359
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:20,660
<8-34,Sheldon>数到三  是都站起来还是直接尿尿
<8-34,Sheldon>When you get to three, do we stand up or do we pee?

360
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:25,960
<8-35,Howard>都站起来
<8-35,Howard>We stand up.

361

<8-36,Sheldon>明智之选

<8-38,Howard>我有预感
<8-38,Howard>Something tells me

<8-38,Howard>今天真不该穿绒面革皮鞋的
<8-38,Howard>this was a bad day to wear suede shoes.

<9-1,Sheldon>我做到了

368
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:05,660
<9-1,Sheldon>是我的了
<9-1,Sheldon>It's mine!

<9-1,Sheldon>得彻底清洗下  让它更漂亮
<9-1,Sheldon>We're going to clean it up and make it pretty.

371
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:19,830
<9-1,Sheldon>我亲爱的

372
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,990
<9-1,Sheldon>我的宝贝
<9-1,Sheldon>My precious.

374
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,460
<9-1,Sheldon>魔戒呢
<9-1,Sheldon>Where's the ring?

375
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:36,360
<9-2,Leonard>在联邦快递的盒子里  回它原来的地方去了
<9-2,Leonard>It's in a FedEx box on its way back to where it came from.

377
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:39,460
<9-3,Raj>末日山的火焰之中
<9-3,Raj>The fires of Mount Doom?

<9-4,Leonard>本就不是我们的
<9-4,Leonard>It wasn't ours.

380
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:44,860
<9-5,Howard>你早就退出了比赛
<9-5,Howard>You quit the game!

381
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,260
<9-5,Howard>根本没资格拿走魔戒
<9-5,Howard>You had no right to take it.

<9-6,Leonard>我走进来的时候  你们都睡着了

<9-6,Leonard>魔戒掉在地板上  没人拿着
<9-6,Leonard>The ring was on the floor. No one was touching it.

384
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:52,360
<9-7,Raj>那就该重新开始  直到产生最后的赢家
<9-7,Raj>Well, so then we start the game over until there's a winner.

385
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:54,730
<9-8,Leonard>根本不会有什么赢家
<9-8,Leonard>There wasn't ever going to be a winner.

386
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,190
<9-8,Leonard>只会有一个手握魔戒的自私鬼

<9-8,Leonard>Is that really what you guys want?

389
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,590
<9-8,Leonard>真想的话  随便吧
<9-8,Leonard>'Cause if it is, fine.

00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:03,990
<9-8,Leonard>我跟你们也没什么好说的了
<9-8,Leonard>I don't want anything to do with you.
