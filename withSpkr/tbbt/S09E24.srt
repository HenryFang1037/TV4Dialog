1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,590
<1-2,Penny>你回来啦  电影看得怎么样
<1-2,Penny>Hi, how was the screening?

2
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:08,770
<1-3,Leonard>谢尔顿搬出罗莎·帕克斯
<1-3,Leonard>Oh, Sheldon invoked Rosa Parks

3
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:11,170
<1-3,Leonard>黑人民权女运动者
<1-3,Leonard>因为拒绝公车司机要求黑人给白人让座的要求而被捕

4
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:11,170
<1-3,Leonard>来让某个插队的人感到愧疚
<1-3,Leonard>to make somebody who cut the line feel bad,

5
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:15,000
<1-3,Leonard>结果只让在场白人感到愧疚
<1-3,Leonard>but only the white people felt bad.

6
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:17,850
<1-4,Penny>我就不该给他买那本
<1-4,Penny>Ugh, I should've never bought him that coloring book

7
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:20,710
<1-4,Penny>美国每年2月是黑人历史月
<1-4,Penny>以表示对非裔黑人历史的尊重与贡献

8
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:20,710
<1-4,Penny>解释黑人历史月的着色本
<1-4,Penny>that explains Black History Month.

9
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:22,190
<1-5,Leonard>你跟我妈处得怎么样
<1-5,Leonard>How'd it go with my mother?

10
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:24,190
<1-6,Penny>一开始有些不顺
<1-6,Penny>Uh, you know, it started a little rocky,

11
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,040
<1-6,Penny>但我们现在已经处得挺好
<1-6,Penny>but I think we got to a good place.

12
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:27,880
<1-7,Leonard>真棒
<1-7,Leonard>Well done.

13
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,250
<1-8,Penny>我送她到酒店的时候
<1-8,Penny>Yeah, and when I dropped her off at the hotel,

14
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,670
<1-8,Penny>她还给了我一个拥抱
<1-8,Penny>she even gave me a hug.

15
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:33,010
<1-9,Leonard>她以为你噎到要施行海姆立克法吗
<1-9,Leonard>Did she think you were choking or...

16
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,320
<1-9,Leonard>我抬杠呢  很棒啊
<1-9,Leonard>I'm sorry, that's great.

17
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,640
<1-9,Leonard>谢谢你花时间陪她
<1-9,Leonard>Thank you for spending time with her.

18
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,250
<1-10,Penny>小事一桩
<1-10,Penny>No problem.

19
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,040
<1-10,Penny>对了
<1-10,Penny>Um, so listen,

20
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,640
<1-10,Penny>我不知道你接下来这周末有何安排
<1-10,Penny>I don't know if you have any plans next weekend,

21
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,260
<1-10,Penny>但我答应了你母亲
<1-10,Penny>but I kind of promised your mom

22
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:45,920
<1-10,Penny>我们会再办个婚礼
<1-10,Penny>we'd have another wedding ceremony

23
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,440
<1-10,Penny>好让她这次能出席
<1-10,Penny>so she could attend this time.

24
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,350
<1-11,Leonard>等等  我们要再结一次婚吗
<1-11,Leonard>Wait, we're gonna get married again?

25
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:54,340
<1-12,Penny>算吧  但这次我们就能邀请亲朋好友来啦
<1-12,Penny>Yeah, kind of, but now we can invite our friends and family.

26
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:57,140
<1-13,Leonard>这一个拥抱代价有点大吧
<1-13,Leonard>Seems like a lot of trouble for a hug.

27
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,340
<1-14,Penny>别这样  会很有意思
<1-14,Penny>Come on, it'll be fun,

28
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,030
<1-14,Penny>而且你妈妈也真的很伤心
<1-14,Penny>and, you know, your mom was genuinely hurt

29
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,530
<1-14,Penny>我们第一次婚礼没邀请她去
<1-14,Penny>we didn't invite her to the first one.

30
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,190
<1-15,Leonard>我得为我们辩解下
<1-15,Leonard>Look, in our defense,

31
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:04,930
<1-15,Leonard>我们当时是一时兴起才去结婚的
<1-15,Leonard>it was kind of a spur of the moment thing,

32
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:07,540
<1-15,Leonard>而且我们不喜欢她啊
<1-15,Leonard>and also, we don't like her.

33
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:09,510
<1-16,Penny>莱纳德  她可是你妈妈
<1-16,Penny>Leonard, come on, she's your mom.

34
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:10,910
<1-16,Penny>如果我们能做件事讨她开心
<1-16,Penny>If we can do something to make her happy,

35
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:11,740
<1-17,Leonard>那为什么不做
<1-17,Leonard>why wouldn't we?

36
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:12,900
<1-17,Leonard>我才说过理由啊
<1-17,Leonard>I just said why--

37
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,350
<1-17,Leonard>我们不喜欢她
<1-17,Leonard>we don't like her.

38
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:15,760
<1-18,Penny>那好  那别想着是为了她
<1-18,Penny>Hey, look, then forget about her,

39
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,680
<1-18,Penny>就当是为了我们自己
<1-18,Penny>let's do it for us.

40
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,270
<1-18,Penny>办一个简单又不会太隆重的就行
<1-18,Penny>We could keep it small and informal.

41
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,150
<1-18,Penny>这次我们能邀请自己的家人
<1-18,Penny>This time we can invite our families.

42
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:21,350
<1-19,Leonard>你哥哥出狱了吗
<1-19,Leonard>Is your brother out of prison?

43
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:23,660
<1-20,Penny>对啊  监狱人满为患  提早获释
<1-20,Penny>Thanks to overcrowding, yeah.

44
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,690
<1-21,Leonard>我爸要是来就好了
<1-21,Leonard>I'd love it if my dad could come.

45
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:27,940
<1-22,Penny>我们可以邀请他啊
<1-22,Penny>Oh, you have to invite him.

46
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,290
<1-22,Penny>他们离婚后我就没见过他了
<1-22,Penny>I haven't seen him since the divorce.

47
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:31,650
<1-23,Leonard>他整个人都不一样了
<1-23,Leonard>Oh, he's like a different man.

48
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,010
<1-23,Leonard>人不抽抽了
<1-23,Leonard>He stopped twitching,

49
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:35,480
<1-23,Leonard>他好像还长高了4公分呢
<1-23,Leonard>and I think he grew an inch and a half.

50
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,380
<1-24,Penny>那就这么定啦
<1-24,Penny>Well, then it's settled.

51
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:40,560
<1-24,Penny>天啊  真有意思
<1-24,Penny>God. So funny.

52
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,970
<1-24,Penny>从来没想到我的二婚对象会是你
<1-24,Penny>I never thought my second marriage would be to you!

63
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:13,260
<2-1,Penny>不是什么有法律效力的婚礼
<2-1,Penny>Okay, so it's not a legal ceremony,

64
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,850
<2-1,Penny>只是一个我们重说婚誓
<2-1,Penny>it's just a chance for us to redo our vows

65
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,750
<2-1,Penny>好让大家能在一旁观礼的机会
<2-1,Penny>so everyone can be part of it.

66
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,250
<2-2,Amy>所以不会有伴娘
<2-2,Amy>So there's no maid of honor?

67
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,380
<2-3,Penny>不会
<2-3,Penny>No.

68
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:27,390
<2-4,Amy>但如果我那天要穿鸡心领的
<2-4,Amy>But if I were to, say, wear a purple satin dress

69
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,580
<2-4,Amy>紫色绸缎小礼服  而且站在你旁边
<2-4,Amy>with a sweetheart neckline and stand near you,

70
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,910
<2-4,Amy>你也没办法阻止我  对吧
<2-4,Amy>you wouldn't be able to stop me, right?

71
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:35,180
<2-5,Penny>你要这样  我也没招啊
<2-5,Penny>I don't see how I could.

72
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:37,960
<2-6,Amy>那我就却之不恭了
<2-6,Amy>Then I graciously accept.

73
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:40,660
<2-7,Bernadette>婚礼由谁来主持呢
<2-7,Bernadette>Who's going to officiate?

74
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,470
<2-8,Penny>我还希望由你主持呢
<2-8,Penny>I was kind of hoping you would.

75
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:45,970
<2-9,Amy>等等  所以我只是没啥鸟用的伴娘吗
<2-9,Amy>Wait, now I'm just some lousy maid of honor?

76
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,880
<2-10,Sheldon>好消息  我刚跟我妈说完电话
<2-10,Sheldon>Hey, good news, I just got off the phone with my mother.

77
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,310
<2-10,Sheldon>她会出席这场婚礼
<2-10,Sheldon>She is coming to the wedding.

78
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,310
<2-11,Penny>好  等等
<2-11,Penny>Okay, wait,

79
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:53,510
<2-11,Penny>你在邀请人来参加我们的婚礼吗
<2-11,Penny>you're inviting people to our wedding?

80
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:57,450
<2-11,Penny>对啊  我在邀请人来参加"我们"的婚礼
<2-11,Penny>Yes, I'm inviting people to our wedding.

81
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:58,800
<2-12,Sheldon>我已经邀请了
<2-12,Sheldon>Yeah, I've already asked

82
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,730
<2-12,Sheldon>史蒂芬·霍金教授与小罗伯特·唐尼
<2-12,Sheldon>Stephen Hawking and Robert Downey Jr.

83
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:02,390
<2-12,Sheldon>还有一个人  你们期望别太高  他很忙
<2-12,Sheldon>And now, don't get your hopes up, 'cause he's pretty busy,

84
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,760
<2-13,Bernadette>是厄爾諾·魯比克
<2-13,Bernadette>but Erno Rubik.

85
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:07,250
<2-13,Bernadette>他是谁啊
<2-13,Bernadette>Who's Erno Rubik?

86
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,160
<2-14,Sheldon>不是吧
<2-14,Sheldon>Seriously?

87
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,840
<2-14,Sheldon>魯比克的方块[魔方]就是他发明的
<2-14,Sheldon>He invented the Rubik's Cube.

88
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:13,040
<2-15,Penny>好吧  行
<2-15,Penny>Okay, fine,

89
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,850
<2-15,Penny>但你为什么要邀请他来我们的婚礼
<2-15,Penny>but why would you invite him to our wedding?

90
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:16,980
<2-16,Sheldon>因为尽管他名利尽收
<2-16,Sheldon>Because, despite his fame and fortune,

91
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,620
<2-16,Sheldon>但我感觉到他是很寂寞的人
<2-16,Sheldon>he strikes me as a lonely man.

92
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,930
<2-17,Bernadette>你真的很贴心
<2-17,Bernadette>Well, it's very sweet of you

93
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:24,030
<2-17,Bernadette>为了莱纳德的妈妈这么费心费力
<2-17,Bernadette>to go to all this trouble for Leonard's mother.

94
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,490
<2-18,Penny>我也是为了莱纳德
<2-18,Penny>Yeah, I'm also doing it for Leonard.

95
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:27,700
<2-18,Penny>我觉得这应该能改善他们的关系
<2-18,Penny>I think this could really help their relationship.

96
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:31,960
<3-1,Beverly>请你老子不用先问过老娘的吗
<3-1,Beverly>How dare you invite your father without consulting me!

97
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:35,570
<3-2,Leonard>对不起  但是我不觉得邀请我爸
<3-2,Leonard>Sorry, but I don't think I need your permission

98
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:37,390
<3-2,Leonard>来参加我的婚礼  需要经过你的同意
<3-2,Leonard>to have my father at my wedding.

99
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:39,480
<3-3,Beverly>你知道我跟他婚姻破碎是因为
<3-3,Beverly>You do understand our marriage ended

100
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,850
<3-3,Beverly>他外遇了吧
<3-3,Beverly>because he had an affair.

101
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:43,630
<3-4,Leonard>我知道  这事万般不应该
<3-4,Leonard>I know, and there's no excuse for that.

102
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:46,870
<3-5,Beverly>他说我冷血  伤他男性自尊
<3-5,Beverly>He claimed I was cold, emasculating,

103
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:50,890
<3-5,Beverly>多年来对他未曾表达过任何肉体上的亲近
<3-5,Beverly>and hadn't shown him any physical affection for years.

104
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:54,120
<3-6,Leonard>我错了  万般不应该中有三个应该
<3-6,Leonard>I was wrong, there's three excuses for that.

105
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,760
<3-6,Leonard>天啊
<3-6,Leonard>Oh, my God.

106
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,400
<4-1,Howard>成功了
<4-1,Howard>It's working.

107
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,290
<4-2,Raj>你确定吗
<4-2,Raj>You sure?

108
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,230
<4-2,Raj>你看
<4-2,Raj>Look.

109
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:11,280
<4-3,Howard>系统能维持自己的稳定性
<4-3,Howard>The system is maintaining its own stability,

110
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,330
<4-3,Howard>量子涡旋装置现在在自控方向
<4-3,Howard>the quantum vortex apparatus is now controlling the orientation.

111
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,950
<6-10,Mary>真的呢
<6-10,Mary>You're right.

112
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,850
<4-3,Howard>你知道这意味着什么吗
<4-3,Howard>You realize what this means?

113
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:23,320
<4-4,Raj>我知道
<4-4,Raj>I do.

114
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,870
<4-5,Howard>这就是概念的验证
<4-5,Howard>It's proof of concept.

115
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,010
<4-5,Howard>我们做出了切实可行的导向系统
<4-5,Howard>We've got a workable guidance system.

116
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,370
<4-6,Raj>恭喜你
<4-6,Raj>Congratulations.

117
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:32,740
<4-6,Raj>谢谢你
<4-6,Raj>Thanks!

118
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:40,820
<4-7,Howard>我收到了美国空军发来的电邮
<4-7,Howard>Hey, I just got an e-mail from the U.S. Air Force.

119
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,250
<4-8,Raj>打开看看
<4-8,Raj>Open it.

120
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,010
<4-9,Howard>"我们希望能尽早跟您见面
<4-9,Howard>"We request a meeting at your earliest convenience

121
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:47,790
<4-9,Howard>谈谈你的量子导向系统
<4-9,Howard>regarding your quantum guidance system,

122
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:51,890
<4-9,Howard>临时专利编号是62/295118"
<4-9,Howard>provisional patent 62/295118."

123
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,920
<4-9,Howard>奇了怪了
<4-9,Howard>That's weird.

124
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:57,720
<4-10,Raj>这里面有我们不知道的暗窗吗
<4-10,Raj>Is there a window around here we don't know about?

125
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,790
<4-11,Howard>我觉得应该只是巧合吧
<4-11,Howard>I'm sure it's just a coincidence.

126
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:01,480
<4-12,Raj>当然啦
<4-12,Raj>Yeah, of course.

127
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,260
<4-12,Raj>不然还能是为什么
<4-12,Raj>What else could it be?

128
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:06,440
<4-12,Raj>妈呀  我真是爱死美国啦
<4-12,Raj>Boy, do I love America.

129
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,410
<5-1,Mary Cooper>谢谢你来接我
<5-1,Mary Cooper>Thank you for picking me up.

130

<7-1,Howard>军方肯定会
<7-1,Howard>The military is just gonna

174
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,500
<7-1,Howard>拿走整个项目
<7-1,Howard>take over the whole project.

175
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,320
<7-1,Howard>如果我们拒绝  后果不用想都知道
<7-1,Howard>And you know what happens if we object?

176
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,970
<7-1,Howard>我们会"被消失"
<7-1,Howard>We disappear.

177
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,090
<7-1,Howard>彻底人间蒸发
<7-1,Howard>Like off the map.

178
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:14,310
<7-1,Howard>就像《美国偶像》第四季之后的每一位冠军[都不红]
<7-1,Howard>Like every American Idol winner since season four.

179
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,200
<7-2,Bernadette>拜托  霍华德  你反应过度了
<7-2,Bernadette>Come on, Howard, you're overreacting.

180
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,220
<7-2,Bernadette>是吗
<7-2,Bernadette>Am I?

181
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,990
<7-3,Howard>是这样吗
<7-3,Howard>Am I?

182
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:24,470
<7-3,Howard>要不要打个赌  某个秘密行动组的家伙
<7-3,Howard>Wha-- what do you want to bet some black ops guy

183
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:26,340
<7-3,Howard>正在重印我的高中毕业纪念册
<7-3,Howard>is reprinting my high school yearbook

184
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,720
<7-3,Howard>而新版本已经没我了
<7-3,Howard>and I'm no longer in it?

185
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,410
<7-3,Howard>那张象棋俱乐部合照
<7-3,Howard>That chess club picture is now

186
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:34,790
<7-3,Howard>现在就剩大卫·齐默尔曼和伊莱恩·周了
<7-3,Howard>just David Zimmerman and Elaine Cho.

187
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:37,070
<7-4,Raj>听着  我打开了空军的官网
<7-4,Raj>Okay, look, I'm on the Air Force Web site,

188
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,650
<7-4,Raj>发邮件给你的那个部门
<7-4,Raj>and the department that e-mailed you

189
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:40,240
<7-4,Raj>是专门负责收购的
<7-4,Raj>is in charge of acquisitions.

190
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,490
<7-4,Raj>或许他们只是想花大钱买你的发明
<7-4,Raj>So maybe they just want to give you a lot of money for your invention.

191
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:45,080
<7-5,Howard>拜托  事情肯定不是这样子
<7-5,Howard>Oh, please, that's not how it works.

192
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,540
<7-5,Howard>你也看过《E.T.》《阿凡达》《侏罗纪世界》吧
<7-5,Howard>You saw  E.T., Avatar, Jurassic World.

193
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:52,200
<7-5,Howard>军方就是跑来接管一切的恶霸
<7-5,Howard>The military just shows up and takes over.

194
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,860
<7-6,Bernadette>你应该知道那些都不是纪录片吧
<7-6,Bernadette>You do realize those weren't documentaries, right?

195
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,990
<7-7,Howard>不好意思  你觉得很好笑吗
<7-7,Howard>I'm sorry, you find this funny?

196
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:01,400
<7-8,Raj>不啊  我只是在回味《侏罗纪世界》
<7-8,Raj>No, I was just thinking about Jurassic World.

197
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,720
<7-8,Raj>那真是部烂片
<7-8,Raj>Boy, that was terrible.

198
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,720
<8-1,Leonard>我们得走楼梯
<8-1,Leonard>Oh, we have to use the stairs.

<8-4,Alfred>Besides, your mother is up there.

203
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,890
<8-4,Alfred>或许我走着走着心脏病发
<8-4,Alfred>Maybe I'll have a heart attack

204
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:27,200
<8-4,Alfred>就不用见她了
<8-4,Alfred>and not have to see her.

<8-6,Alfred>I should have never had that angioplasty

210

251
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:34,780
<10-1,Howard>对方可是美国空军
<10-1,Howard>It's the Air Force.

252
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,870
<10-1,Howard>我是该回复这封邮件
<10-1,Howard>I mean, should I respond to their e-mail?

253
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:37,860
<10-2,Raj>还是置之不理
<10-2,Raj>Ignore it?

254
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:38,850
<10-2,Raj>你不能置之不理
<10-2,Raj>You can't ignore it.

255
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:42,970
<10-2,Raj>这又不是牙医发来让你回去做检查的贺卡
<10-2,Raj>It's not that postcard that says it's time to go back to the dentist.

256
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,560
<10-3,Bernadette>小哥俩  走吧
<10-3,Bernadette>Guys, come on.

257
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,560
<10-3,Bernadette>我们约了大家吃饭呢
<10-3,Bernadette>We're meeting everyone for dinner.

258
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,880
<10-4,Howard>稍等  我就怕万一我回复了
<10-4,Howard>One sec. I'm just afraid if I respond,

259
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,520
<10-4,Howard>他们就知道我的项目成功了
<10-4,Howard>then they'll know I got it.

260
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,050
<10-5,Raj>伙计
<10-5,Raj>Oh, dude.

261
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,530
<10-5,Raj>你点开邮件的那一刻
<10-5,Raj>The minute you opened that e-mail,

262
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:52,400
<10-5,Raj>他们就知道你成功了
<10-5,Raj>they knew you got it.

263
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,390
<10-5,Raj>没准他们现在就通过
<10-5,Raj>I mean, they're probably looking at you

264
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,750
<10-5,Raj>电脑的摄像头监视你呢
<10-5,Raj>through the camera right now.

265
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,050
<10-5,Raj>我勒个去
<10-5,Raj>Oh, damn.

266
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,050
<10-6,Bernadette>我爱美国哟
<10-6,Bernadette>I love America.

267
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,290
<10-6,Bernadette>你们闹够了没有
<10-6,Bernadette>Are you done with this nonsense?

268
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:04,400
<10-7,Howard>这不是闹着玩的
<10-7,Howard>It's not nonsense.

269
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,720
<10-7,Howard>美国军方就是这么办事儿的
<10-7,Howard>This is how the U.S. Military works.

270
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,290
<10-8,Raj>就算是美国军方好了
<10-8,Raj>Oh, if it's even the U.S. Military.

271
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:11,680
<10-8,Raj>那也可以是假装成美方的外国军方势力
<10-8,Raj>It could be foreign military pretending to be American.

272
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,590
<10-9,Howard>你说得对  我们一旦把导向系统给了他们
<10-9,Howard>You're right. We turn our guidance system over to them,

273
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:16,470
<10-9,Howard>他们会立即拿来对付美国
<10-9,Howard>next thing we know, they're using it against us.

274
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:21,290
<10-10,Raj>我也爱美国的敌人们哟
<10-10,Raj>I also love the enemies of America.

275
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:32,960
<11-1,Beverly>佩妮  希望我和莱纳德父亲的
<11-1,Beverly>Penny, I hope the example of my failed marriage

276
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,150
<11-1,Beverly>失败婚姻并没有让你
<11-1,Beverly>to Leonard's father doesn't discourage you

277
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:37,490
<11-1,Beverly>对你俩的婚姻失去信心
<11-1,Beverly>from the commitment you've made to one another.

278
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:39,990
<11-2,Penny>当然不会
<11-2,Penny>Oh, of course not.

279
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:44,820
<11-3,Beverly>不过我和阿尔弗雷德的感情比你们的深厚
<11-3,Beverly>Although Alfred and I had a lot more going for us than you two.

280
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:49,770
<11-4,Leonard>妈  多留几句"好话"祝酒时说吧
<11-4,Leonard>Mom, please save something for the toast.

281
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,760
<12-1,Mary>阿尔弗雷德  你是做什么的
<12-1,Mary>So, Alfred, what is it that you do for a living?

282
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,290
<12-2,Alfred>我是一名人类学家
<12-2,Alfred>Oh, I'm an anthropologist.

283
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:00,240
<12-2,Alfred>我研究古人和古文化
<12-2,Alfred>I study ancient peoples and cultures.

284
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,190
<12-3,Mary>老天  就是史前大洪水之前的一切吗
<12-3,Mary>My goodness, so all the way back to the Flood.

285
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,190
<12-3,Mary>《圣经》中记载了挪亚时代发生的全球大洪水
<12-3,Mary>也就是诺亚方舟故事的由来

286
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,390
<12-4,Sheldon>别笑  她刚不是开玩笑
<12-4,Sheldon>Don't laugh-- she wasn't joking.

287
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,560
<12-5,Amy>玩你的手机  别多事
<12-5,Amy>Play with your phone.

288
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,680
<12-6,Alfred>关于这一点
<12-6,Alfred>Well, on that note,

289
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,410
<12-6,Alfred>在很多不同国家的文化中  他们的神话里
<12-6,Alfred>there are many cultures that have an apocalyptic flood

290
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:20,250
<12-6,Alfred>都有过末日大洪水的记载
<12-6,Alfred>as part of their mythology.

291
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,610
<12-7,Mary>我不信神话
<12-7,Mary>I don't have a mythology.

292
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:23,470
<12-7,Mary>我只信永远正确的上帝之话
<12-7,Mary>I have the unerring Word of God.

293
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:25,250
<12-7,Mary>但你说的非常有意思
<12-7,Mary>But that's very interesting.

294
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,210
<12-8,Alfred>我没有看不起你的信仰的意思
<12-8,Alfred>I-I didn't mean to disparage your faith.

295
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:29,950
<12-8,Alfred>其实我挺欣赏的
<12-8,Alfred>Actually, I admire it.

296
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,090
<12-9,Mary>-真的吗  -当然
<12-9,Mary>- Really? - Yes.

297
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:32,770
<12-10,Alfred>我自己是不可知论者
<12-10,Alfred>Yes, I'm an agnostic myself,

298
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:35,260
<12-10,Alfred>但我曾祷告过很多次  祈求上帝
<12-10,Alfred>but I have prayed, many times, to God,

299
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:39,060
<12-10,Alfred>将我妻子变成一根盐柱
<12-10,Alfred>to turn my wife into a pillar of salt.

301
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:41,040
<12-11,Mary>也算接近了吧
<12-11,Mary>Well, He came close.

302
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,370
<12-11,Mary>把她变成一块大冰块
<12-11,Mary>Turned her into a giant block of ice.

303
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,700
<13-1,Raj>霍华德  大学里肯定可以找到
<13-1,Raj>Howard, there must be someone at the university

304
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,170
<13-1,Raj>能帮你的人吧
<13-1,Raj>you can go to for help.

305
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:52,480
<13-2,Howard>开什么玩笑
<13-2,Howard>Are you kidding?

306
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,870
<13-2,Howard>没准就是他们先把消息
<13-2,Howard>They're probably the ones who leaked it

307
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:56,510
<13-2,Howard>透漏给军方的
<13-2,Howard>to the military in the first place.

308
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,120
<13-3,Raj>那第四台新闻里那哥们呢
<13-3,Raj>What about the guy on the Channel Four News?

309
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,970
<13-3,Raj>总说"第四与你同一阵线"
<13-3,Raj>You know, "Four on Your Side"?

310
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:04,620
<13-3,Raj>也许他也可以来你的阵线
<13-3,Raj>Maybe he can be on your side.

311
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,810
<13-4,Howard>我是被政府骚扰
<13-4,Howard>I'm being harassed by the government,

312
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:11,630
<13-4,Howard>不是想弄清诈骗骗局真相
<13-4,Howard>not trying to get to the bottom of a dog-walking scam.

313
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:14,280
<13-5,Bernadette>够了
<13-5,Bernadette>Oh, stop!

314
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,850
<13-5,Bernadette>你知道真相是什么吗
<13-5,Bernadette>You know what's really happening?

315
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:17,150
<13-5,Bernadette>所有你看过的电影
<13-5,Bernadette>All the movies you've watched,

316
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:18,510
<13-5,Bernadette>电视剧  漫画书
<13-5,Bernadette>the TV shows, the comic books--

317
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:20,440
<13-5,Bernadette>将你的想法彻底扭曲了
<13-5,Bernadette>they've completely twisted your thinking.

318
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,960
<13-5,Bernadette>没人在追查你  没人在监听你
<13-5,Bernadette>No one's after you, no one's listening to you,

319
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,550
<13-5,Bernadette>根本没人在乎你
<13-5,Bernadette>no one cares about you.

320
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,000
<13-6,Raj>我还是希望
<13-6,Raj>I'd like to think

321
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,280
<13-6,Raj>"第四与你同一阵线"那哥们是在乎我的
<13-6,Raj>the "Four on Your Side" guy cares about me.

322
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,650
<14-1,Penny>贝弗莉  我知道你和阿尔弗雷德
<14-1,Penny>You know, Beverly, I know you and Alfred

323
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:37,080
<14-1,Penny>有你们的分歧  但其实你想一下
<14-1,Penny>have your differences, but if you think about it,

324
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:40,130
<14-1,Penny>如果你没嫁给他  就不会有莱纳德了
<14-1,Penny>if you hadn't married him, there'd be no Leonard.

325
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,660
<14-1,Penny>所以也是好事  对不对
<14-1,Penny>So that's good, right?

326
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:43,760
<14-2,Beverly>对吧
<14-2,Beverly>Yeah.

327
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:52,030
<14-3,Leonard>前面是霍华德吗
<14-3,Leonard>Is that Howard in front of us?

328
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,200
<14-4,Penny>好像是
<14-4,Penny>Oh, maybe.

329
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,870
<14-4,Penny>跟上他们
<14-4,Penny>Get closer.

330
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:58,300
<14-5,Howard>天啊
<14-5,Howard>Oh, God.

331
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,370
<14-5,Howard>好像有人跟踪我们
<14-5,Howard>I think someone's following us.

332
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,140
<14-6,Bernadette>你在自己脑补
<14-6,Bernadette>You're being ridiculous.

333
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:06,370
<14-7,Howard>真不是我脑补  他就跟在后面
<14-7,Howard>I'm not being ridiculous-- he's right on my tail.

334
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,900
<14-8,Raj>在这左转  看他们会不会跟着转
<14-8,Raj>Uh, turn left here and see if he turns with us.

335
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,410
<14-9,Penny>他为什么在这转弯
<14-9,Penny>Well, why is he turning here?

336
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:13,560
<14-9,Penny>饭店在另一边
<14-9,Penny>The restaurant's the other way.

337
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,460
<14-9,Penny>不知道
<14-9,Penny>I don't know.

338
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:16,980
<14-10,Leonard>他有用一款路况软件  可能前头出车祸了吧
<14-10,Leonard>He uses that traffic app. Maybe there's an accident.

339
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,870
<14-11,Penny>那跟他走吧
<14-11,Penny>Oh, so follow him.

340
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,460
<14-12,Raj>不好
<14-12,Raj>Oh, no!

341
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,570
<14-13,Howard>我就说吧
<14-13,Howard>I told you!

342
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:29,090
<14-14,Bernadette>可能只是巧合而已
<14-14,Bernadette>It's probably just a coincidence.

343
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:31,560
<14-14,Bernadette>加点速  看他会不会跟上来
<14-14,Bernadette>Speed up a little, see if he stays with you.

344
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,090
<14-15,Penny>你快点开
<14-15,Penny>Well, go faster.

345
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:33,950
<14-15,Penny>要跟丢了
<14-15,Penny>You're losing him.

346
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:34,950
<14-16,Leonard>他怎么那么急
<14-16,Leonard>What is his hurry?

347
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:35,800
<14-17,Penny>这样  你闪一下车灯
<14-17,Penny>You know what, flash your lights.

348
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,620
<14-17,Penny>让他知道是你
<14-17,Penny>Let him know it's you.

349
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,330
<14-18,Howard>他在闪灯
<14-18,Howard>He's flashing his lights.

350
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:40,650
<14-18,Howard>那是什么意思
<14-18,Howard>What's that mean?

351
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:42,640
<14-19,Raj>他好像想让我们靠边停
<14-19,Raj>I-I think he wants us to pull over.

352
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,560
<14-20,Bernadette>不许靠边停
<14-20,Bernadette>Do not pull over!

353
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,200
<14-20,Bernadette>我才不要当单亲妈妈
<14-20,Bernadette>I'm not raising this baby alone!

354
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,610
<14-21,Howard>坐稳了
<14-21,Howard>Hang on!

355
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,890
<15-1,Alfred>你丈夫去世以后
<15-1,Alfred>So, after your husband passed,

356
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:56,050
<15-1,Alfred>你没有再嫁吗
<15-1,Alfred>you never remarried?

357
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:59,140
<15-2,Mary>没有  全情投入在工作和教堂上了
<15-2,Mary>No, just focused on work and the church.

358
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,590
<15-3,Alfred>你是做什么工作的
<15-3,Alfred>Ah. And what do you do?

<15-8,Amy>你看出来是怎么回事了吗
<15-8,Amy>Do you realize what's happening here?

364
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:13,900
<15-9,Sheldon>当然了
<15-9,Sheldon>Yeah, I do.

365
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:17,030
<15-9,Sheldon>他们面包吃太多  一会该吃不下饭了
<15-9,Sheldon>They're filling up on bread and ruining their meal.

366
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:21,900
<15-12,Amy>你们怎么那么晚
<15-12,Amy>What took you guys so long?

367

<15-13,Leonard>我们本来跟着霍华德来着  但不知道怎么
<15-13,Leonard>Oh, we were following Howard, but for some reason,

368
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:28,210
<15-13,Leonard>他把车灯关掉逆着单行道走了
<15-13,Leonard>he turned off his headlights and went up a one-way street.

369
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:29,990
<15-14,Penny>你们聊什么了
<15-14,Penny>So, what did we miss?

370
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:32,730
<15-15,Alfred>不过是我和玛丽彼此了解一下
<15-15,Alfred>Oh, just Mary and I getting to know each other a little.

371
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:34,860
<15-16,Mary>莱纳德  你父亲真是讨人喜欢
<15-16,Mary>Leonard, your father is just charming.

372
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:35,790
<15-17,Beverly>他还破产了
<15-17,Beverly>He's also broke.

373
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:37,690
<15-17,Beverly>他没有告诉你吗
<15-17,Beverly>Did he mention that?

374
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:43,150
<15-18,Leonard>好的  妈  你去那边坐
<15-18,Leonard>Okay, Mom, you sit over there...

375
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:46,880
<15-19,Penny>我给伯纳黛特打电话  问问怎么这么久
<15-19,Penny>And I'm gonna call Bernadette and see what's keeping them.

376
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:49,790
<15-20,Sheldon>我要是早知道你破产了
<15-20,Sheldon>If I'd known you were broke,

377
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:52,740
<15-20,Sheldon>就不会那么在意你多吃面包了
<15-20,Sheldon>I wouldn't have made a big deal about the bread.

378
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,600
<16-1,Bernadette (on phone)>佩妮
<16-1,Bernadette (on phone)>Hey, Penny.

379
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,330
<16-1,Bernadette (on phone)>你说什么呢
<16-1,Bernadette (on phone)>What are you talking about?

380
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,880
<16-1,Bernadette (on phone)>刚刚那是你啊
<16-1,Bernadette (on phone)>Oh, that was you?

381
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,240
<16-1,Bernadette (on phone)>说来话长
<16-1,Bernadette (on phone)>Long story.

382
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,570
<16-1,Bernadette (on phone)>你们先吃吧
<16-1,Bernadette (on phone)>Why don't you go ahead and eat.

383
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:11,520
<16-1,Bernadette (on phone)>我们恐怕还要一会儿呢
<16-1,Bernadette (on phone)>We're gonna be a while.

384
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:17,200
<16-2,Howard>我跟你说  我没嗑药
<16-2,Howard>I'm telling you, I'm not on drugs.

385
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,480
<16-2,Howard>是政府要抓我
<16-2,Howard>The government's out to get me!

386
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:26,140
<16-2,Howard>最近一个比较有趣的新发现
<16-2,Howard>Now, one of the more exciting things to be found recently

387
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,880
<17-1,Alfred>就是尼安德塔人[穴居人]
<17-1,Alfred>is that Neanderthals

388
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,990
<17-1,Alfred>与智人[现代人类祖先]  常会与彼此交配
<17-1,Alfred>and Homosapiens frequently mated with each other.

389
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,540
<17-2,Mary>这下我就明白
<17-2,Mary>Well, that certainly explains

390
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,670
<17-2,Mary>为什么我会嫁给谢尔顿的父亲了
<17-2,Mary>my marriage to Sheldon's father.

391
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:41,340
<17-3,Sheldon>非常好笑  因为我父亲不是特别聪明的人
<17-3,Sheldon>That's funny, because my father was not a very clever man.

392
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:44,270
<17-4,Amy>没有你"我什么都听不懂了"
<17-4,Amy>I'd be lost without you.

393
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:49,180
<17-5,Leonard>我想邀大家举杯
<17-5,Leonard>Uh, I would like to propose a toast

00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,240

<17-5,Leonard>to my wife and bride-to-be.

395
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,570
<17-6,Sheldon>你看  这句好笑的点在...
<17-6,Sheldon>See, that's funny because...

396
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:54,290
<17-7,Amy>玩你手机去
<17-7,Amy>Back to your phone.

<17-11,Leonard>Cheers.

405
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:18,500
<17-12,Alfred>我也想举杯
<17-12,Alfred>I, uh, I would also like to make a toast.

406
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:20,920

<17-15,Beverly>你什么意思给老娘讲清楚
<17-15,Beverly>What the hell is that supposed to mean?

410
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,970
<17-16,Alfred>你该吃药了
<17-16,Alfred>Why don't you take a pill?

411
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:33,340
<17-17,Beverly>就像你上床之前那样吗
<17-17,Beverly>Like you did before sex?

412
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:36,430
<17-18,Alfred>其实当时我最想要的是眼罩
<17-18,Alfred>What I really needed was a blindfold.

413
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,050
<17-18,Alfred>好了  各位

<17-19,Mary>calm down.

415
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:41,280
<17-19,Mary>我们想想《圣经》里是怎么说的
<17-19,Mary>Let's all remember what it says in the Bible:

416
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,330
<17-19,Mary>"不轻易发怒的
<17-19,Mary>"He who is slow to anger

417
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:44,940
<17-19,Mary>胜过勇士"
<17-19,Mary>is better than the mighty."

418
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:48,910
<17-20,Beverly>你这女人  能看看别的书吗
<17-20,Beverly>Oh, dear woman, can you please read another book?

419
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:52,780
<17-21,Mary>只要上帝出新作  我就追
<17-21,Mary>When God writes one, I will.

420
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:02,970
<17-22,Penny>如果谁想点舒芙蕾吃
<17-22,Penny>Um, if-if we want to order the souffle

421
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:05,160
<17-22,Penny>现在可以点了
<17-22,Penny>we might want to get on that.

422
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,260
<17-23,Alfred>莱纳德  希望你别介意  我有些累了
<17-23,Alfred>Leonard, if you don't mind, I-I think I'm a little tired.

423
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,750
<17-23,Alfred>今晚就到这里吧
<17-23,Alfred>I'm gonna call it a night.

424
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,120
<17-24,Leonard>当然不介意  爸爸
<17-24,Leonard>Sure, Dad.

425
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,580
<17-25,Mary>我也有些累坏了
<17-25,Mary>I'm a little tuckered out myself,

426
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:18,030
<17-25,Mary>各位明早见
<17-25,Mary>so I will see you all in the morning.

427
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:20,110
<17-26,Alfred>愿意跟我一起打车吗
<17-26,Alfred>Would you like to share a cab?

428
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:21,370
<17-27,Mary>当然好
<17-27,Mary>That would be fine.

429
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:22,120
<17-28,Alfred>你在哪住
<17-28,Alfred>Where are you staying?

430
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,050
<17-29,Mary>威斯汀酒店
<17-29,Mary>I'm at the Westin.

431
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:24,210
<17-30,Alfred>我也是
<17-30,Alfred>Oh, so am I.

432
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:25,540
<17-30,Alfred>能请你喝杯睡前酒吗
<17-30,Alfred>Can I interest you in a nightcap?

433
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:28,190
<17-31,Mary>当然可以
<17-31,Mary>I think that you could.

434
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,210
<17-32,Leonard>那是怎么回事
<17-32,Leonard>What is happening there?

435
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:37,440
<17-33,Sheldon>我觉得再明显不过了
<17-33,Sheldon>I think it's pretty obvious.

436
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,510
<17-33,Sheldon>他们不想吃甜点  因为吃了一肚子面包
<17-33,Sheldon>They don't want dessert 'cause they filled up on bread.

437
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,420
<18-1,Sheldon>她还是不接
<18-1,Sheldon>She's still not answering.

438
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,660
<18-2,Leonard>我爸也没回信息
<18-2,Leonard>My father's not texting me back.

439
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:59,710
<18-3,Penny>因为他们都关机了啊
<18-3,Penny>'Cause they both turned their phones off.

440
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:07,030
<18-4,Sheldon>我一点都不喜欢这样
<18-4,Sheldon>I don't like this at all.

441
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,100
<18-5,Leonard>我也不喜欢
<18-5,Leonard>I don't like it either.

442
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,610
<18-5,Leonard>真的吗
<18-5,Leonard>Really?

443
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,860
<18-6,Penny>可我爱死了
<18-6,Penny>'Cause I love it.
