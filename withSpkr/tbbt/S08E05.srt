1
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:06,350
<1-1,Raj>我读到有人发明了一种
<1-1,Raj>Hey, I read that someone invented a way

2
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:08,860
<1-1,Raj>可以把脚步转换为电磁能量的方法
<1-1,Raj>to covert your footsteps into electromagnetic energy,

3
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:10,960
<1-1,Raj>这样就能边走路边给手机充电了
<1-1,Raj>so you can charge your cell phone while walking.

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,740
<1-2,Leonard>这点子我们几年前就想到了
<1-2,Leonard>We had that idea years ago.

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,090
<1-2,Leonard>当初我们怎么没想过去实践呢
<1-2,Leonard>How come we never did anything with it?

6
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:16,540
<1-3,Howard>大概是因为当时我们把设计稿忘在餐厅
<1-3,Howard>Probably because we left the diagram of it in the restaurant,

7
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:19,160
<1-3,Howard>却没人愿意走回去拿吧
<1-3,Howard>and none of us wanted to walk back.

8
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:23,820
<1-4,Sheldon>我知道你在这计划上毫无成果的真正原因
<1-4,Sheldon>I know the real reason you never made progress with that idea.

9
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,070
<1-4,Sheldon>你于2007年9月22号想到这个点子
<1-4,Sheldon>You thought of it September 22, 2007.

10
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:29,510
<1-4,Sheldon>两天后  佩妮搬进公寓了
<1-4,Sheldon>Two days later, Penny moved in,

11
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:31,750
<1-4,Sheldon>你全身的血液都灌进了你的小弟弟
<1-4,Sheldon>and so much blood rushed to your genitals,

12
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:33,920
<1-4,Sheldon>于是你的脑子就废了
<1-4,Sheldon>your brain became a ghost town.

13
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:37,340
<1-5,Leonard>才不是这样呢
<1-5,Leonard>That's not what happened.

14
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:39,100
<1-6,Sheldon>我记得非常清楚
<1-6,Sheldon>I remember it distinctly

15
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,580
<1-6,Sheldon>因为当时我刚创作了一首年度诗歌
<1-6,Sheldon>because I had just composed my annual poem

16
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,390
<1-6,Sheldon>美国最著名的儿童教育绘本作家
<1-6,Sheldon>死于1991年9月24日

17
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,390
<1-6,Sheldon>以在苏斯博士的逝世纪念日追忆他
<1-6,Sheldon>commemorating the anniversary of Dr. Seuss's death.

18
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:45,280
<1-7,Howard>我们不想听
<1-7,Howard>No one wants to hear it.

19
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,890
<1-8,Sheldon>为何  死去
<1-8,Sheldon>Why, die.

20
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,390
<1-8,Sheldon>为何  他会  死去
<1-8,Sheldon>Why did he die?

21
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:49,500
<1-8,Sheldon>人说  老了
<1-8,Sheldon>Old, told.

22
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,870
<1-8,Sheldon>人说  他是  老了
<1-8,Sheldon>I was told he was old.

23
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:55,250
<1-9,Leonard>我不实践那个点子不是因为佩妮
<1-9,Leonard>Penny is not the reason I didn't pursue that idea.

24
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:57,330
<1-10,Sheldon>是吗  那自从认识她后
<1-10,Sheldon>Oh, really? Since meeting her,

25
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:59,860
<1-10,Sheldon>你最大的成就都有什么
<1-10,Sheldon>what have been your greatest accomplishments?

26
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:00,710
<1-11,Raj>很好答
<1-11,Raj>Easy.

27
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:02,520
<1-11,Raj>跟佩妮上床
<1-11,Raj>Sleeping with Penny.

28
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:05,310
<1-12,Howard>佩妮甩了他之后  又成功把她拐回来
<1-12,Howard>Getting Penny to go back out with him after she dumped him.

29
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:07,020
<1-13,Raj>还拐佩妮订了婚
<1-13,Raj>Tricking Penny into getting engaged.

30
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:11,150
<1-14,Howard>还有几周前  他差点成功做了一个引体向上哦
<1-14,Howard>And a few weeks ago, he almost did a pull-up.

31
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:15,440
<1-15,Leonard>某人貌似该给我磕头认错哦
<1-15,Leonard>I think someone owes me an apology.

32
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,840
<1-16,Sheldon>别难过了
<1-16,Sheldon>Well, don't feel bad.

33
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,460
<1-16,Sheldon>我觉得自从我们的生活
<1-16,Sheldon>I think we've all been distracted

34
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:21,520
<1-16,Sheldon>有了女人后  我们都分心了
<1-16,Sheldon>since the girls entered our lives.

35
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,130
<1-17,Howard>所以你承认艾米让你分心了吗
<1-17,Howard>You admit Amy's a distraction?

36
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:24,730
<1-18,Sheldon>太扰乱了
<1-18,Sheldon>Oh, very much so.

37
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:27,670
<1-18,Sheldon>你们评评理  这短信是两天前发的
<1-18,Sheldon>Listen to this. This is from two days ago.

38
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,720
<1-18,Sheldon>"你好  希望你今天过得愉快"
<1-18,Sheldon>"Hi. Hope you're having a good day."

39
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,300
<1-18,Sheldon>谁有空回她没完没了的调情短信呀
<1-18,Sheldon>Who has time for this constant sexting?

40
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:37,300
<1-19,Leonard>或许我们的注意力是被分散了
<1-19,Leonard>Well, maybe we have lost our focus.

41
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:41,050
<1-20,Howard>我们聚在一起来场头脑风暴也未尝不可
<1-20,Howard>It wouldn't kill us to get together and brainstorm ideas.

42
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:43,340
<1-21,Raj>我们可以来一场那种集思会
<1-21,Raj>Ooh, we could have one of those retreats.

43
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,940
<2-2,Leonard>就像我们四个人的科学集思会
<2-2,Leonard>Like our own science retreat.

44
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,840
<1-22,Howard>我表哥有一间林间小屋
<1-22,Howard>My cousin has a cabin out in the woods.

45
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,450
<1-23,Sheldon>我不要去林间小屋
<1-23,Sheldon>I'm not going to a cabin in the woods.

46
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:52,770
<1-23,Sheldon>你们没看过《林间小屋》吗
<1-23,Sheldon>Did you see the movie Cabin in the Woods?

47
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:52,770
<1-23,Sheldon>电影讲述5个好朋友来到了密林深处的一座小木屋
<1-23,Sheldon>可怕的事情接二连三地发生

48
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,120
<1-24,Leonard>那我们去酒店好了
<1-24,Leonard>Then we'll go to a hotel.

49
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:58,690
<1-25,Sheldon>酒店  你们没看过《闪灵》吗
<1-25,Sheldon>A hotel? Did you see The Shining?

50
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:58,690
<1-25,Sheldon>电影讲述一个作家接受了一份酒店冬天看门的工作
<1-25,Sheldon>当主角一家住进酒店后  诡异的事情接二连三地发生

51
00:01:58,690 --> 00:01:59,860
<1-26,Raj>我们可以去大熊湖
<1-26,Raj>We could go up to Big Bear

52
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:00,950
<1-26,Raj>找一间湖边小屋
<1-26,Raj>and get a house on the lake.

53
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:03,830
<1-27,Sheldon>你们没看过《湖边小屋》吗
<1-27,Sheldon>Did you see The Lake House?

54
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:04,770
<1-27,Sheldon>2006年浪漫戏剧电影
<1-27,Sheldon>是韩国电影《触不到的恋人》的美国重制版本

55
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:06,160
<1-28,Raj>《湖边小屋》里没发生恐怖事件啊
<1-28,Raj>Nothing bad happens in The Lake House.

56
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,970
<1-29,Sheldon>没发生在主角身上  发生在我身上了
<1-29,Sheldon>Yeah, well, no, not to them. To me.

57
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,120
<1-29,Sheldon>能穿梭时光的邮箱
<1-29,Sheldon>Time traveling mailbox.

58
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:11,860
<1-29,Sheldon>这部烂片里唯一穿梭的
<1-29,Sheldon>The only time that traveled

59
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,720
<1-29,Sheldon>就是我穿梭进粪坑里一个半小时的青春年华
<1-29,Sheldon>was an hour and half of my life down the toilet.

60
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,660
<1-30,Leonard>好吧  那我们就待在这里开会
<1-30,Leonard>Fine. Then we'll just stay here and do it.

61
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,340
<1-31,Sheldon>你怎么不问去不去海滨小屋
<1-31,Sheldon>Well, you didn't suggest a beach house.

62
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,570
<1-32,Leonard>你愿意去吗
<1-32,Leonard>You would go to a beach house?

63
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:22,540
<1-33,Sheldon>当然不去  你没看过《大白鲨》吗
<1-33,Sheldon>Well, good Lord, no-- have you seen Jaws?

64
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:22,540
<1-33,Sheldon>电影讲述一个海滨小镇出现一头巨大的食人大白鲨
<1-33,Sheldon>导致多名游客命丧其口

71
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:51,190
<2-2,Leonard>我们四个在讨论
<2-2,Leonard>So, the guys and I are talking about

72
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:53,490
<2-2,Leonard>这周末开一个科学集思会
<2-2,Leonard>having kind of a science retreat this weekend.

73
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:55,340
<2-2,Leonard>我想询问下你意见
<2-2,Leonard>I just wanted to know if that's okay.

74
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,250
<2-2,Leonard>因为我们之前说周日要一起吃早午餐
<2-2,Leonard>You and I had talked about going to brunch on Sunday...

75
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,260
<2-3,Penny>这周末想去拉斯维加斯吗
<2-3,Penny>Want to go to Vegas this weekend?

76
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,560
<2-4,Amy>当然想
<2-4,Amy>Of course I do.

77
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:00,680
<2-5,Penny>伯纳黛特
<2-5,Penny>Bernadette?

78
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,970
<2-5,Penny>闺蜜去拉斯维加斯过周末  去吗
<2-5,Penny>Girl's weekend. Vegas. You in?

<2-6,Bernadette>-当然去  -那就定了
<2-6,Bernadette>- Hell, yeah! - Yes!

80
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:05,590
<2-8,Bernadette>-我去查机票  -我来查酒店
<2-8,Bernadette>- I'll check flights. - I'll check hotels.

81
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,610
<2-9,Amy>我去检查我的内裤
<2-9,Amy>I'll check my underpants.

82
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:08,790
<2-9,Amy>我激动到貌似都尿了
<2-9,Amy>I'm so excited, I think I peed.

83
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,160
<2-10,Leonard>她们完全没意见
<2-10,Leonard>They seem okay with it.

84
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:26,850
<3-3,Howard>我还以为你不来了呢
<3-3,Howard>I didn't think you'd make it.

85
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:27,550
<3-4,Raj>何出此言
<3-4,Raj>Why not?

86
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:29,340
<3-5,Howard>因为你现在有一个稳定的女朋友
<3-5,Howard>Well, 'cause you have a steady girlfriend now,

87
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,600
<3-5,Howard>我们以为你得待在家
<3-5,Howard>and we assumed you'd have to stay home

88
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,130
<3-5,Howard>放食物到你困住她的深坑里
<3-5,Howard>to lower the food down to her in the pit.

89
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:40,680
<3-6,Raj>跟你报告一下  艾米丽今晚要工作
<3-6,Raj>For your information, Emily is working tonight.

90
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,880
<3-7,Sheldon>有人会认为她的工作就是要爬出那个深坑
<3-7,Sheldon>Yeah, one would assume, on getting out of the pit.

91
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:46,800
<3-8,Leonard>好  我们来集中注意力
<3-8,Leonard>Okay, let's focus.

92
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,330
<3-8,Leonard>女生们都不在  我们有48小时
<3-8,Leonard>The girls are gone, we have 48 hours.

93
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:49,600
<3-8,Leonard>无人打扰
<3-8,Leonard>There are no distractions.

94
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,150
<3-8,Leonard>让我们一起改变世界吧
<3-8,Leonard>Let's change the world.

95
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:53,120
<3-9,Sheldon>我戴上我的思考小帽了  开始吧
<3-9,Sheldon>Thinking caps on. Here we go.

96
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,360
<3-11,Raj>真是太令人激动了  我们在创新耶
<3-11,Raj>Ooh, this is exciting. We're innovating.

97
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,110
<3-11,Raj>感觉我们就像《社交网络》里演的那样
<3-11,Raj>I feel like we're in the Facebook movie.

98
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:58,790
<3-12,Howard>我从未看过那部电影
<3-12,Howard>Oh. I never saw that.

99
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:00,310
<3-13,Sheldon>真的假的
<3-13,Sheldon>Yeah. Really?

100
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:02,420
<3-14,Raj>那电影超棒的  我发誓我这么说不是因为
<3-14,Raj>It's wonderful, and I swear I'm not saying that

101
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,980
<3-14,Raj>里面有男神贾斯汀·汀布莱克
<3-14,Raj>because Justin Timberlake is in it.

102
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,600
<3-15,Sheldon>我有蓝光碟
<3-15,Sheldon>Yeah, I have it on Blu-ray.

103
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,260
<3-15,Sheldon>我们来看吧
<3-15,Sheldon>We should watch it.

104
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:12,100
<3-16,Raj>好啊  我来做爆米花
<3-16,Raj>Cool. I'll make the popcorn.

105
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,530
<3-16,Raj>各位
<3-16,Raj>Guys...

106
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:15,020
<3-17,Leonard>在短短的30秒里  我们从
<3-17,Leonard>in 30 seconds, we went from

107
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,810
<3-17,Leonard>"一起改变世界"变成了"一起看电视"
<3-17,Leonard>"Let's change the world" to "Let's watch TV."

108
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:21,110
<3-18,Sheldon>抱歉  你是说"不看"吗
<3-18,Sheldon>I'm sorry. Is that a "no"?

109
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,500
<3-19,Howard>不了  莱纳德说得对
<3-19,Howard>Okay. No. Leonard's right.

110
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,600
<3-19,Howard>我们是来集思的
<3-19,Howard>We're here to focus.

111
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,440
<3-19,Howard>以前不是有个本子专门记下我们的点子吗
<3-19,Howard>Didn't we used to have a list of all our ideas?

112
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,210
<3-20,Leonard>我好像还留着呢
<3-20,Leonard>I-I think I still have it.

113
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:28,880
<3-21,Sheldon>我没有听到确切的回答
<3-21,Sheldon>I did not get a clear answer.

114
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,960
<3-21,Sheldon>所以我先把光盘放下
<3-21,Sheldon>I'm gonna set this down now.

115
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:33,680
<3-22,Leonard>找到了
<3-22,Leonard>Ah, here it is.

116
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:37,160
<3-22,Leonard>我好多年没翻过了
<3-22,Leonard>I haven't looked at these in years.

117
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,940
<3-22,Leonard>"机器人女友"
<3-22,Leonard>"Robot girlfriend."

118
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,750
<3-23,Howard>那是我的点子
<3-23,Howard>Mm, that was mine.

119
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:44,320
<3-24,Leonard>"机器人妓女"
<3-24,Leonard>"Robot prostitute."

120
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,220
<3-25,Howard>也是我的
<3-25,Howard>Also mine.

121
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,240
<3-26,Sheldon>慢着  我不懂
<3-26,Sheldon>Wait. I'm confused.

122
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,960
<3-26,Sheldon>既然你有机器人女友了
<3-26,Sheldon>Why would you need both a robot girlfriend

123
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,730
<3-26,Sheldon>干嘛还要机器人妓女
<3-26,Sheldon>and a robot prostitute?

124
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:56,400
<3-27,Howard>有些"事"是不会拿来摧残自己的机器女友滴
<3-27,Howard>There's just some things you don't do with your robot girlfriend.

125
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,930
<3-28,Raj>天啊  你遇到伯纳黛特后
<3-28,Raj>Boy, when you met Bernadette,

126
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:01,990
<3-28,Raj>机器人这一领域真是痛失英才啊
<3-28,Raj>the field of robotics really took a hit.

127
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,320
<3-29,Leonard>我们先跳过你可以拿来"爽"的所有发明
<3-29,Leonard>Okay, let's just skip all the inventions you can have sex with.

128
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,540
<3-29,Leonard>找到一个
<3-29,Leonard>All right, no-- here we go:

129
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,240
<3-29,Leonard>"人体工学加热座垫"
<3-29,Leonard>"Ergonomic heated seat cushion."

130
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,230
<3-30,Howard>不  那玩意会"震动"  继续翻
<3-30,Howard>No, it vibrates. Keep going.

131
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,940
<3-31,Leonard>算了  我们想一些新点子吧
<3-31,Leonard>You know, let's just come up with something new.

132
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:26,170
<3-32,Sheldon>很多重要的创新
<3-32,Sheldon>You know, a number of significant innovations

133
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:28,070
<3-32,Sheldon>灵感都来源自科幻小说
<3-32,Sheldon>have been inspired by science fiction.

134
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:31,450
<3-32,Sheldon>地球同步卫星来自亚瑟·克拉克的一篇文章
<3-32,Sheldon>The-the geosynchronous satellite from Arthur C. Clarke.

135
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:31,450
<3-32,Sheldon>英国著名科幻小说家
<3-32,Sheldon>地球同步卫星轨道被命名为"克拉克轨道"

136
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:34,210
<3-32,Sheldon>摩托罗拉的翻盖手机来自《星际迷航》
<3-32,Sheldon>The Motorola flip phone-- that came from Star Trek.

138
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:36,610
<3-32,Sheldon>对啊  我一直怀疑
<3-32,Sheldon>Yeah, and I've long suspected that the idea

139
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:38,750
<3-32,Sheldon>非裔美国人当选总统的点子
<3-32,Sheldon>of an African-American president was stolen

140
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:42,100
<3-32,Sheldon>是剽窃电影《天地大冲撞》
<3-32,Sheldon>from the movie Deep Impact.

141
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:42,100
<3-32,Sheldon>美国1998年的一部科幻灾难电影
<3-32,Sheldon>片中摩根·弗里曼扮演一名黑人总统

142
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:46,730
<3-33,Raj>《回到未来2》所说的未来
<3-33,Raj>Hey, the future they show in Back to the Future II

143
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:48,610
<3-33,Raj>电影讲述80年代的马蒂和博士开时光机到了2015年
<3-33,Raj>帮助解决马蒂儿子的事

144
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:48,610
<3-33,Raj>离现在只有一年之遥
<3-33,Raj>is only a year away.

145
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:50,770
<3-33,Raj>那部电影里的很多东西现在仍未被发明呢
<3-33,Raj>A lot of the things in that movie haven't been invented yet.

146
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:51,950
<3-34,Leonard>如果我们可以
<3-34,Leonard>How cool would that be

147
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,520
<3-34,Leonard>让其中一样变成现实  那该多酷啊
<3-34,Leonard>if we could make one of those a reality?

148
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,330
<3-35,Sheldon>如果我们能找出马蒂的悬浮滑板
<3-35,Sheldon>If we could figure out the scientific basis

149
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:56,760
<3-35,Sheldon>所需的科学依据
<3-35,Sheldon>for Marty's hover board,

150
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,010
<3-35,Sheldon>那肯定会得到普遍应用
<3-35,Sheldon>that would have universal application.

151
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:01,180
<3-36,Leonard>这在绝对零度下是可行的
<3-36,Leonard>Well, it's-it's possible at absolute zero,

152
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:04,200
<3-36,Leonard>但我们必须得想办法消除这温度上的限制
<3-36,Leonard>but we would have to remove the temperature restrictions.

153
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,650
<3-37,Raj>我有个好点子
<3-37,Raj>Oh, I have an idea.

154
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:06,960
<3-38,Sheldon>我猜我的点子跟你的一样
<3-38,Sheldon>I think I have the same one.

155
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,280
<3-39,Howard>我们得来看《回到过去2》啊
<3-39,Howard>We got to watch Back to the Future II!

156
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,490
<3-40,Raj>我来做爆米花
<3-40,Raj>I'll make the popcorn.

157
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:17,470
<4-1,Penny>我们先去哪里玩
<4-1,Penny>So, where should we go first?

158
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,920
<4-2,Amy>大厅里有个翻唱乐队
<4-2,Amy>There's a cover band in the lounge.

159
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,120
<4-4,Amy>-不要  -可他们演奏巴瑞·曼尼洛呢
<4-4,Amy>- Nah. - But they play Barry Manilow.

161
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,940
<4-6,Amy>-不去  -可他们名叫"蛮像曼尼洛"呢
<4-6,Amy>- No. - But they're called "Fairly Manilow."

162
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,180
<4-7,Penny>好吧
<4-7,Penny>Oh. Okay.

163
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,990
<4-8,Amy>-太棒了  -不去
<4-8,Amy>- Great! - No!

164
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,220
<4-10,Bernadette>那你想干什么
<4-10,Bernadette>Well, what do you want to do?

165
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,780
<4-11,Penny>我们可是在维加斯
<4-11,Penny>Well, we're in Vegas.

166
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,380
<4-11,Penny>我要下楼来"一桶"玛格丽塔酒
<4-11,Penny>I want to go downstairs, get a bucket of margaritas,

167
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,760
<4-11,Penny>肆意热舞  直到狂吐在轮盘赌上
<4-11,Penny>dance until I vomit all over a roulette wheel

168
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,520
<4-11,Penny>再看着呕吐物随轮盘飘洒四方
<4-11,Penny>and watch it go everywhere.

169
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:43,030
<4-12,Amy>要是我们不想吐怎么办
<4-12,Amy>What if we don't want to vomit?

170
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:45,690
<4-13,Penny>绝对会吐  所以才会给你"一桶"啊
<4-13,Penny>Oh, you will. That's why they give you the bucket.

171
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,800
<4-14,Amy>怎么了
<4-14,Amy>What?

172
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,300
<4-15,Penny>我老板发来的
<4-15,Penny>It's my boss.

173
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,470
<4-15,Penny>我的实习安排被提前到周一了
<4-15,Penny>They moved my field ride up to Monday.

174
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:53,580
<4-16,Amy>什么意思
<4-16,Amy>What does that mean?

175
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,360
<4-17,Penny>我本来有一周时间做功课
<4-17,Penny>It means instead of having a week to study,

176
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,850
<4-17,Penny>现在只剩两天了
<4-17,Penny>I only have two days.

177
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,020
<4-18,Bernadette>太糟糕了
<4-18,Bernadette>That sucks.

178
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,720
<4-19,Amy>你不能早上再开始看吗
<4-19,Amy>Can you start in the morning?

179
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,460
<4-20,Penny>要看的东西可多着呢
<4-20,Penny>Uh, it's kind of a lot.

180
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,610
<4-20,Penny>我现在先看一点吧
<4-20,Penny>You know, let me do a little tonight,

181
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:04,050
<4-20,Penny>晚点再来找你们玩
<4-20,Penny>and I'll catch up with you guys later.

182
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:06,190
<4-22,Penny>-你确定吗  -没事  你们走吧
<4-22,Penny>- You sure? - Yeah, it's okay. Go ahead.

183
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:10,340
<4-23,Amy>那个  既然佩妮不去了
<4-23,Amy>So, um, now that Penny's not coming...

184
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,450
<4-24,Bernadette>-我们打死也不会去看"蛮像曼尼洛"  -好吧
<4-24,Bernadette>- We're not seeing Fairly Manilow. - Okay.

185
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,640
<5-1,Howard>等等  暂停一下
<5-1,Howard>Hold on. Pause.

186
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,180
<5-1,Howard>有点儿不对劲啊  你看
<5-1,Howard>Something doesn't make sense. Look...

187
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,640
<5-1,Howard>2015年  毕夫偷了《体育年鉴》
<5-1,Howard>In 2015, Biff steals the sports almanac

188
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:32,420
<5-1,Howard>用时光机把它带回1955年
<5-1,Howard>and takes the time machine back to 1955,

189
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,080
<5-1,Howard>交给过去年少的自己
<5-1,Howard>to give it to his younger self.

190
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,110
<5-1,Howard>可他这样做  不就改变了未来吗
<5-1,Howard>But as soon as he does that, he changes the future,

191
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:39,360
<5-1,Howard>所以他再返回的2015年
<5-1,Howard>so the 2015 he returns to would be

192
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,920
<5-1,Howard>是另一条没有马蒂和博士的2015年时间线
<5-1,Howard>a different 2015, not the 2015 that Marty and Doc were in.

193
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:48,850
<5-2,Leoanard>《热浴盆时光机》时我们就讨论过了
<5-2,Leoanard>This is Hot Tub Time Machine all over again.

194
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:48,850
<5-2,Leoanard>电影讲述三个好朋友回到孩提时的滑雪场旅店
<5-2,Leoanard>利用屋中的热浴盆时光机回到1987年

195
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,850
<5-2,Leoanard>如果未来的毕夫把年鉴
<5-2,Leoanard>If future Biff goes back to 2015

196
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:53,960
<5-2,Leoanard>交给过去的自己后  马上回到2015年
<5-2,Leoanard>right after he gives young Biff the almanac,

197
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:57,050
<5-2,Leoanard>他就可以回到有马蒂和博士的那个时代
<5-2,Leoanard>he could get back to the 2015 with Marty and Doc in it.

198
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:59,950
<5-2,Leoanard>因为1955年的毕夫要到过21岁生日时
<5-2,Leoanard>Because it wasn't until his 21st birthday

199
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:03,010
<5-2,Leoanard>才下了第一个赌注
<5-2,Leoanard>that 1955 Biff placed his first bet.

200
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:03,830
<5-3,Sheldon>等等  等等
<5-3,Sheldon>Wait. Whoa, whoa.

201
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,460
<5-3,Sheldon>这里用"下了"合适吗
<5-3,Sheldon>Is "placed" right?

202
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,290
<5-4,Leonard>什么意思
<5-4,Leonard>What do you mean?

203
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:08,450
<5-5,Sheldon>当受未来的因素所影响
<5-5,Sheldon>Is "placed" the right tense

204
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:10,530
<5-5,Sheldon>导致一件事有可能在过去的未来发生时
<5-5,Sheldon>for something that would have happened in the future

205
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:13,950
<5-5,Sheldon>用"下了"这个时态合适吗
<5-5,Sheldon>of a past that was affected by something from the future?

206
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,870
<5-6,Leonard>"已经将会下了"吗
<5-6,Leonard>Had will have placed?

207
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:20,040
<5-7,Sheldon>这才乖嘛
<5-7,Sheldon>That's my boy.

208
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,920
<5-8,Leonard>好了  毕夫直到21岁
<5-8,Leonard>Okay, so, it wasn't until his 21st birthday

209
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,360
<5-8,Leonard>才已经将会下了第一个赌注
<5-8,Leonard>that Biff had will have placed his first bet

210
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,520
<5-8,Leonard>赢得了百万美元
<5-8,Leonard>and made his millions.

211
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,670
<5-8,Leonard>这时他才改变了时间线
<5-8,Leonard>That's when he altered the timeline.

212
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:34,010
<5-9,Sheldon>没错  但是他已经将会还未下了呀
<5-9,Sheldon>Yeah, but he had will haven't placed it!

213
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:37,900
<5-10,Howard>什么
<5-10,Howard>What?!

214
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:39,980
<5-11,Sheldon>和《热浴盆时光机》不同
<5-11,Sheldon>Unlike Hot Tub Time Machine,

215
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,880
<5-11,Sheldon>这个问题简单多了
<5-11,Sheldon>this couldn't be more simple.

216
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,440
<5-11,Sheldon>毕夫把年鉴带去1955年时
<5-11,Sheldon>When Biff gets the almanac in 1955,

217
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,060
<5-11,Sheldon>他所创造出的2015年并不是
<5-11,Sheldon>the alternate future he creates isn't the one

218
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,580
<5-11,Sheldon>马蒂和布朗博士驾驶时光机
<5-11,Sheldon>in which Marty and Doc Brown ever use the time machine

219
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,090
<5-11,Sheldon>所去的2015年
<5-11,Sheldon>to travel to 2015.

220
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:51,940
<5-11,Sheldon>所以
<5-11,Sheldon>Therefore,

221
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,190
<5-11,Sheldon>在新的时间线中
<5-11,Sheldon>in the new timeline,

222
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:55,460
<5-11,Sheldon>马蒂和博士从未驾驶着时光机
<5-11,Sheldon>Marty and Doc never brought the time machine...

223
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,310
<5-12,Leonard>等等
<5-12,Leonard>W-Wait.

224
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:57,960
<5-12,Leonard>这里用"驾驶着"合适吗
<5-12,Leonard>Is "brought" right?

225
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:06,370
<5-13,Sheldon>马蒂和博士从未已经会曾经驾驶着吗
<5-13,Sheldon>Marty and Doc never had have had brought?

226
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,630
<5-14,Leonard>我不知道  你刚才故意刁难我的
<5-14,Leonard>I don't know. You did it to me.

227
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,580
<5-12,Leonard>反正我就这么用了
<5-12,Leonard>Oh, I'm going with it.

228
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,850
<5-13,Sheldon>马蒂和博士从未已经会曾经驾驶着
<5-13,Sheldon>Marty and Doc never had have had brought

229
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:16,830
<5-14,Leonard>时光机回到2015年
<5-14,Leonard>the time machine to 2015.

230
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:19,750
<5-15,Sheldon>所以2015年的毕夫也有可能
<5-15,Sheldon>That means 2015 Biff could also

231
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:23,850
<5-15,Sheldon>没有已经有曾经把年鉴带给1955年的毕夫
<5-15,Sheldon>not had have had brought the almanac to 1955 Biff.

232
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:28,340
<5-15,Sheldon>因此  1955年毕夫拿到年鉴的时间线
<5-15,Sheldon>Therefore, the timeline in which 1955 Biff gets the almanac

233
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,670
<5-15,Sheldon>恰恰就是
<5-15,Sheldon>is also the timeline

234
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,730
<5-15,Sheldon>1955年的毕夫从未拿到年鉴的时间线
<5-15,Sheldon>in which 1955 Biff never gets the almanac.

235
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,310
<5-15,Sheldon>不光是"从未拿到"
<5-15,Sheldon>And not just "never gets."

236
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:35,850
<5-15,Sheldon>还是"从未已经拿到  从未曾经拿到
<5-15,Sheldon>Never have, never hasn't,

237
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:38,310
<5-15,Sheldon>从未曾经已经没拿到"
<5-15,Sheldon>never had have hasn't.

238
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,190
<5-16,Raj>他说得对
<5-16,Raj>He's right.

239
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:49,540
<5-16,Raj>再说了  谁会取毕夫这种名字啊
<5-16,Raj>Also, what kind of name is Biff?

240
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:52,540
<5-16,Raj>听着就像当你打开一管品食乐面团的声音
<5-16,Raj>Sounds like when you pop open a can of Pillsbury dough.

241
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,600
<5-16,Raj>哔呋
<5-16,Raj>Biff.

242
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,270
<5-17,Howard>那面团裹在迷你维纳肠上可好吃了
<5-17,Howard>Oh, that stuff is so good wrapped around cocktail weenies.

243
00:09:59,270 --> 00:09:59,890
<5-18,Leonard>各位
<5-18,Leonard>Guys...

244
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,440
<5-19,Sheldon>你们知道"维纳肠"这个词
<5-19,Sheldon>Do you know that the word "Wiener"

245
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,130
<5-19,Sheldon>是从奥地利首都维也纳的德语写法中来的吗
<5-19,Sheldon>comes from the German name of the Austrian capital Vienna,

246
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:05,050
<5-19,Sheldon>也就是"维纳"
<5-19,Sheldon>or "Wien"?

247
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:06,290
<5-20,Raj>你知道奥地利在地图上的形状
<5-20,Raj>Do you know if you look at Austria on a map

248
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:08,130
<5-20,Raj>和小鸡鸡一模一样吗
<5-20,Raj>it actually looks like a wiener?

250
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,350
<5-21,Leonard>各位  我们这是干嘛呢
<5-21,Leonard>Guys, what are we doing?

251
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:11,530
<5-21,Leonard>我们把女生们都赶走
<5-21,Leonard>W-We sent the girls away

252
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:13,270
<5-21,Leonard>就是为了集中注意力
<5-21,Leonard>so we could focus.

253
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,900
<5-22,Sheldon>我觉得这招不管用
<5-22,Sheldon>I don't think it worked.

254
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:30,840
<6-1,Amy>喝完这杯后  也许你会想听曼尼洛
<6-1,Amy>Maybe after this, you'll be in the mood for some Manilow.

255
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,920
<6-2,Bernadette>喝完这杯  老娘估计就挂了
<6-2,Bernadette>I think after this, I'll be dead.

256
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,540
<6-3,Amy>看看我们俩在外面玩
<6-3,Amy>Look at us out,

257
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,680
<6-3,Amy>佩妮留在房间学习
<6-3,Amy>while Penny's in the room studying.

258
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,750
<6-4,Bernadette>我为她骄傲
<6-4,Bernadette>I'm proud of her.

259
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:40,850
<6-4,Bernadette>这是个难得的机会
<6-4,Bernadette>This is a great opportunity.

260
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:42,680
<6-4,Bernadette>她愿意认真对待实在太好了
<6-4,Bernadette>It's nice to see her take it seriously.

261
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,580
<6-5,Amy>说得对
<6-5,Amy>It is.

262
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,320
<6-5,Amy>不要讨论佩妮了
<6-5,Amy>But enough about Penny.

263
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,330
<6-5,Amy>说说我俩吧
<6-5,Amy>Let's talk about us.

264
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,030
<6-5,Amy>我们俩美翻了
<6-5,Amy>We're looking good.

265
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,970
<6-6,Bernadette>的确
<6-6,Bernadette>We are...

266
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:52,740
<6-7,Amy>不止是美翻了
<6-7,Amy>Better than good.

267
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:55,840
<6-7,Amy>看看你  凹凸有致都要爆出来了
<6-7,Amy>I mean, look at you. Your body's bangin'!

268
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:57,510
<6-8,Bernadette>艾米
<6-8,Bernadette>Amy!

269
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,390
<6-9,Amy>少来
<6-9,Amy>Don't "Amy" me.

270
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:00,320
<6-9,Amy>我们老是说佩妮有多火辣
<6-9,Amy>We're always talking about how hot Penny is.

271
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,830
<6-9,Amy>但我们科学家之间要坦诚相待
<6-9,Amy>Come on-- scientist to scientist,

272
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:06,240
<6-9,Amy>你这对"强子碰撞机"有多大
<6-9,Amy>how big are those Hadron Colliders?

273
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:10,100
<6-10,Bernadette>你说得人家好尴尬
<6-10,Bernadette>You're embarrassing me.

274
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,250
<6-11,Amy>有啥好尴尬的
<6-11,Amy>Oh, don't be embarrassed.

275
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:14,030
<6-11,Amy>我也可以给你看我脊椎上的凹陷
<6-11,Amy>I'll show you the divot in my spine.

276
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:16,530
<6-13,Amy>-什么  -没什么大不了的  我生下来就有
<6-13,Amy>- What? - No, no, it's okay. I was born with it.

277
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:18,090
<6-13,Amy>要是往里面放一节五号电池
<6-13,Amy>If you put a double-A battery in there,

278
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:20,260
<6-13,Amy>我就会开始踢腿哦
<6-13,Amy>it makes my leg kick.

279
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:24,720
<7-1,Leonard>好了
<7-1,Leonard>All right.

280
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,420
<7-2,Sheldon>一看就感觉比刚才好多了
<7-2,Sheldon>Oh, this is already better.

281
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,780
<7-2,Sheldon>没有那么多干扰
<7-2,Sheldon>There are far fewer distractions in here.

282
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:29,810
<7-3,Raj>再说  这里本来就是
<7-3,Raj>Plus, this is where our minds

283
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:31,570
<7-3,Raj>让我们专注于工作的地方
<7-3,Raj>are conditioned to focus on work.

284
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:33,530
<7-4,Leonard>我一直在思考悬浮滑板的问题
<7-4,Leonard>So, I've been thinking about the hover boards,

285
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:36,130
<7-4,Leonard>也许能把磁力悬浮技术用在上面
<7-4,Leonard>and maybe there's a way we could use maglev technology.

286
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:38,930
<7-5,Howard>又或者如果能找出过度冷却材料的办法
<7-5,Howard>Or if we could figure out a way to supercool the materials,

287
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:40,580
<7-5,Howard>我们就能使用量子耦合了
<7-5,Howard>we could utilize quantum coupling.

288
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,580
<7-6,Sheldon>不知道有人试过这办法没
<7-6,Sheldon>Well, I wonder if anyone's tried that.

289
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,350
<7-7,Raj>上网查查呗
<7-7,Raj>Go online and look it up.

290
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:45,730
<7-8,Howard>的确是铁证如山啊
<7-8,Howard>Oh, I can't argue with him.

291
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:47,250
<7-8,Howard>瞧这屏幕上的形状
<7-8,Howard>It's right there on the screen.

292
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,960
<7-8,Howard>奥地利和鸡鸡长得一模一样
<7-8,Howard>Austria does look like a wiener.

293
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:52,960
<7-9,Raj>这算什么  老兄
<7-9,Raj>That's nothing, dude.

294
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,580
<7-9,Raj>看看弗罗里达州  那才叫"神雕"
<7-9,Raj>Go check out how hung Florida is.

295
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,370
<7-10,Leonard>我相信弗州小姐肯定腿都合不拢了
<7-10,Leonard>I'm sure Mrs. Florida's walking funny.

296
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:00,860
<7-10,Leonard>能不能回到正题上来
<7-10,Leonard>Can we get back to work?

297
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,830
<7-10,Leonard>他说得对
<7-10,Leonard>Yeah... he's right.

298
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:05,930
<7-11,Sheldon>我还有个想法
<7-11,Sheldon>Oh, here's a thought.

299
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:09,340
<7-11,Sheldon>能不能用一点操作条件反射方法
<7-11,Sheldon>What if we use some form of operant conditioning techniques

300
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,280
<7-11,Sheldon>来防止我们偏题
<7-11,Sheldon>to keep us from getting off topic?

301
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,940
<7-12,Howard>你是说类似行为修正吗
<7-12,Howard>Like behavior modification?

302
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,140
<7-13,Sheldon>就是那个
<7-13,Sheldon>Yeah, exactly.

303
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:16,190
<7-13,Sheldon>你们知道这些技术
<7-13,Sheldon>Did you know those techniques

304
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:19,500
<7-13,Sheldon>以前是用来教鸽子打乒乓球的吗
<7-13,Sheldon>were used to actually teach pigeons to play ping-pong?

305
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,330
<7-14,Raj>我才不信呢
<7-14,Raj>That cannot be true.

306
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:33,320
<7-15,Raj>喂  都打到赛末点了
<7-15,Raj>Hey, it was match point.

307
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,660
<7-16,Leonard>有些心理学家
<7-16,Leonard>Some psychologists

308
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,730
<7-16,Leonard>会加上惩罚来配合操作性条件反射
<7-16,Leonard>perform operant conditioning with punishment.

309
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:40,240
<7-16,Leonard>也许我们可以想出一个处罚方式
<7-16,Leonard>Maybe we can come up with a punishment

310
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,450
<7-16,Leonard>来惩罚偏题行为
<7-16,Leonard>for straying off topic.

311
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:46,420
<7-17,Raj>比如不让看鸽子乒乓球赛的结果吗
<7-17,Raj>Not getting to see who wins at pigeon ping-pong comes to mind.

312
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:49,150
<7-18,Howard>我们可以每次一有跑题行为
<7-18,Howard>We could snap a rubber band on our wrists

313
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:51,290
<7-18,Howard>就拿橡皮筋往手腕上弹一下
<7-18,Howard>every time we get sidetracked.

314
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:54,370
<7-19,Sheldon>想法不错  要知道在中世纪
<7-19,Sheldon>Mmm, not bad. You know, in medieval times,

315
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:56,650
<7-19,Sheldon>惩罚闲聊行为的装置叫做
<7-19,Sheldon>idle chatter was punished with a device called

316
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,290
<7-19,Sheldon>长舌妇的面具[样子像马笼头]
<7-19,Sheldon>the scold's bridle.

317
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:00,080
<7-19,Sheldon>是一个铁笼子
<7-19,Sheldon>It's an iron cage

318
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,560
<7-19,Sheldon>套住头锁起来  把舌头刺穿钉住
<7-19,Sheldon>that's locked around the head and pierces the tongue.

319
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,410
<7-20,Leonard>咱要是有一个该有多好
<7-20,Leonard>If only we had one.

320
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:10,400
<7-21,Sheldon>有了  我可以上亚马逊网找
<7-21,Sheldon>Oh! I'll check Amazon.

321
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:18,140
<8-1,Bernadette>客房服务
<8-1,Bernadette>Housekeeping!

322
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:21,900
<8-2,Amy>我们接到投诉
<8-2,Amy>We had a complaint

323
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:25,410
<8-2,Amy>这里有人把派对气氛全搞没了
<8-2,Amy>about somebody pooping on a party in there!

324
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:30,700
<8-3,Bernadette>其实客房小妹就是我们啦
<8-3,Bernadette>It was us the whole time!

325
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:33,330
<8-4,Amy>你为什么要告诉她  她本来信了
<8-4,Amy>Why'd you tell her? It was working.

326
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:35,060
<8-5,Bernadette>你信了吗
<8-5,Bernadette>Was it working?

327
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,780
<8-6,Penny>是的
<8-6,Penny>Yeah.

328
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:39,820
<8-7,Bernadette>真是对不起
<8-7,Bernadette>Oh, I'm so sorry.

329
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,370
<8-8,Penny>你们看起来玩得很开心啊
<8-8,Penny>You guys look like you're having fun.

330
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:44,510
<8-9,Amy>开心死了
<8-9,Amy>We're having the best time.

331
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,570
<8-10,Bernadette>猜猜谁玩掷骰子赢了一百块
<8-10,Bernadette>Guess who won $100 playing craps.

332
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:50,070
<8-11,Penny>这是一块钱
<8-11,Penny>That's a dollar.

333
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:54,160
<8-12,Bernadette>那猜猜谁成了给鸡尾酒女侍者高额小费的凯子
<8-12,Bernadette>Then guess who wildly overtipped a cocktail waitress.

334
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:56,240
<8-13,Amy>佩妮  我们走吧
<8-13,Amy>Hey, Penny... hey, let's go.

335
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,980
<8-13,Amy>我们发现一个地方有澳大利亚脱衣舞男哦
<8-13,Amy>We found a place that has Australian male strippers.

336
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:04,370
<8-14,Bernadette>我们想看看他们是不是反方向转小弟弟
<8-14,Bernadette>We want to see if they twirl their junk in the other direction.

337
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:04,370
<8-14,Bernadette>有种说法  南北半球水平运动的物体
<8-14,Bernadette>受地转偏向力影响分别向左和向右偏

338
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,410
<8-15,Penny>听起来真不错
<8-15,Penny>That sounds so great.

339
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:17,860
<8-15,Penny>但我还有一些功课要做
<8-15,Penny>But I have a little more studying to do.

340
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:20,850
<8-16,Amy>瞧这书呆的德行
<8-16,Amy>Can you believe this nerd?

341
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:24,390
<8-17,Bernadette>来嘛  你想坐在这里做书虫
<8-17,Bernadette>Come on, do you want to sit here being a loser,

342
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:25,810
<8-17,Bernadette>还是想看我像袋鼠宝宝一样
<8-17,Bernadette>or do you want to watch me climb into

343
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:30,350
<8-17,Bernadette>勇攀澳大利亚猛男的丁字裤"高峰"
<8-17,Bernadette>an Australian man's G-string like a baby kangaroo?

344
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,800
<8-18,Penny>姐妹们  我也很想出去玩乐
<8-18,Penny>All right, guys, look, I would love to go out,

345
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,340
<8-18,Penny>但我必须把这些功课做完
<8-18,Penny>but I've got to get this done, okay?

346
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,850
<8-18,Penny>你们在夜店玩得开心点
<8-18,Penny>So have fun at the club.

347
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:43,200
<8-18,Penny>如果有麻烦  就去找警察叔叔
<8-18,Penny>And if you get in trouble, find a policeman.

348
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,410
<8-18,Penny>如果他脱掉了裤子
<8-18,Penny>And if he's taking off his pants,

349
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:46,840
<8-18,Penny>那他就不是真正的警察叔叔[舞男]
<8-18,Penny>he is not a real policeman.

350
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,680
<8-19,Amy>好吧  看来这对她来说很重要
<8-19,Amy>Okay, okay, this is obviously very important to her.

351
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:54,110
<8-19,Amy>我们来帮她  让她快点把功课做完
<8-19,Amy>Let's just, we'll help her study so she can get done quicker.

352
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:55,870
<8-19,Amy>来吧  我来提问
<8-19,Amy>Here... here, I'm gonna quiz you.

353
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,400
<8-19,Amy>我来提问
<8-19,Amy>I'm gonna quiz you.

354
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,620
<8-19,Amy>笔记在我这里
<8-19,Amy>I got your notes!

355
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,020
<8-19,Amy>笔记在我这里
<8-19,Amy>I got your notes!

356
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:02,990
<8-19,Amy>笔记在我这里
<8-19,Amy>I got your notes!

357
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:03,930
<8-19,Amy>如果你想要
<8-19,Amy>If you want these,

358
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:06,480
<8-19,Amy>就来脱衣舞男俱乐部找吧
<8-19,Amy>they're gonna be at the strip club!

359
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:10,150
<8-20,Bernadette>你不去追她吗
<8-20,Bernadette>Aren't you gonna chase her?

360
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:12,470
<8-21,Penny>追到衣帽间吗  可以考虑
<8-21,Penny>To the walk-in closet? Sure.

361
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,610
<9-1,Leonard>我们都同意了
<9-1,Leonard>Okay, so we agree,

362
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:23,000
<9-1,Leonard>无论何时只要有人偏题
<9-1,Leonard>whenever someone takes us off topic

363
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,420
<9-1,Leonard>粘臂毛的胶带就得被扯掉一块
<9-1,Leonard>they get their arm hair yanked off.

364
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,220
<9-2,Raj>我不能让这样的事发生
<9-2,Raj>And I really can't let that happen

365
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,610
<9-2,Raj>否则帮我修眉的女生会以为
<9-2,Raj>or the girl who does my eyebrows will think

366
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:30,540
<9-2,Raj>我还有别人帮我修毛
<9-2,Raj>I've been cheating on her.

367
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:34,910
<9-3,Leonard>好了  量子耦合的一个好处就是
<9-3,Leonard>All right, now, one benefit of quantum coupling...

368
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,030
<9-4,Sheldon>慢着  问一下
<9-4,Sheldon>Wait, no, question:

369
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:38,450
<9-4,Sheldon>偏不偏题  谁来决定
<9-4,Sheldon>who decides if someone's gone off topic?

370
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:41,070
<9-5,Leonard>我想很容易判断吧  如果模棱两可就投票决定
<9-5,Leonard>I think it'll be pretty clear. If not, we'll take a vote.

371
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:42,370
<9-5,Leonard>还有
<9-5,Leonard>Oh, and also...

372
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:47,230
<9-6,Sheldon>我们还没有投票呢
<9-6,Sheldon>W-We didn't vote!

373
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:49,540
<9-7,Leonard>不必投票  你明显是带偏话题了
<9-7,Leonard>We didn't have to-- that was clearly a tangent.

374
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,040
<9-7,Leonard>快点  继续工作
<9-7,Leonard>Now come on. Back to work.

375
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,870
<9-7,Leonard>如果我们侧重于量子耦合
<9-7,Leonard>If we're leaning towards quantum coupling...

376
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,870
<9-7,Leonard>凭什么
<9-7,Leonard>Why?

377
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:56,930
<9-8,Sheldon>你刚说"量子耦合"
<9-8,Sheldon>You said "quantum coupling."

378
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:59,080
<9-8,Sheldon>让我想起电视剧《量子跳跃》
<9-8,Sheldon>That made me think of the show Quantum Leap.

380
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,550
<9-8,Sheldon>这是偏题  是你的错
<9-8,Sheldon>That's a tangent and it's your fault.

381
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:02,560
<9-9,Howard>太荒谬了
<9-9,Howard>That's ridiculous.

382
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,320
<9-9,Howard>谢尔顿  我投票这不是带偏题
<9-9,Howard>Sheldon, I vote that is not a tangent.

383
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,410
<9-10,Leonard>谢谢  现在我把没帮你撕的补上
<9-10,Leonard>Thank you. And now I owe you one.

384
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:09,930
<9-11,Sheldon>这全是你的错
<9-11,Sheldon>That was your fault.

385
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,960
<9-13,Raj>妈呀  好多毛
<9-13,Raj>Ooh, that is a lot of hair.

386
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:19,190
<9-13,Raj>这下得听珍妮唠叨了
<9-13,Raj>And now I'm gonna hear it from Jenny.

387
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,380
<9-14,Leonard>大家住手
<9-14,Leonard>Everyone stop.

388
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,830
<9-14,Leonard>这是一个愚蠢的主意
<9-14,Leonard>This was a stupid idea.

389
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:25,090
<9-14,Leonard>负强化不管用
<9-14,Leonard>Negative reinforcement isn't working.

390
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:27,000
<9-15,Sheldon>你是说正惩罚[施加负面刺激]吧
<9-15,Sheldon>I think you mean positive punishment.

391
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,230
<9-15,Sheldon>负强化是指取消正面刺激[奖励]
<9-15,Sheldon>Negative reinforcement is the removal of a positive stimulus.

392
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:31,790
<9-15,Sheldon>这是个常见的错误
<9-15,Sheldon>It's a common mistake.

393
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,920
<9-16,Howard>所以这么做真的不是负强化吗
<9-16,Howard>Negative reinforcement is really wrong?

394
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,770
<9-17,Sheldon>当然  它总是被用错
<9-17,Sheldon>Oh, it's used incorrectly all the time.

395
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:37,650
<9-17,Sheldon>就连比尔·默里
<9-17,Sheldon>Even Bill Murray makes that mistake

396
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:39,540
<9-17,Sheldon>在《捉鬼敢死队》的第一场戏中也错了
<9-17,Sheldon>in the first scene of Ghostbusters.

397
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,760
<9-18,Raj>不可能  比尔[主演]高大的形像不能毁
<9-18,Raj>No way. Not Bill Murray.

398
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,840
<9-19,Bill Murray (on screen)>我正在研究超自然能力中
<9-19,Bill Murray (on screen)>I'm studying the effect of negative reinforcement

399
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,880
<9-19,Bill Murray (on screen)>负强化的效果
<9-19,Bill Murray (on screen)>on ESP ability.

400
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,130
<9-20,Raj>比尔·默里高大形象果然毁了
<9-20,Raj>Bill Murray did get it wrong.

401
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:53,700
<9-21,Howard>跳到棉花糖宝宝那一幕
<9-21,Howard>Jump ahead to the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.

402
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,740
<9-22,Leonard>不要
<9-22,Leonard>No!

403
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:57,470
<9-22,Leonard>莱纳德是对的
<9-22,Leonard>Leonard's right.

404
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:59,000
<9-23,Sheldon>我们不能直接"跳到"
<9-23,Sheldon>We can't just jump ahead.

405
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,320
<9-23,Sheldon>-我们得看完整部电影  -听着
<9-23,Sheldon>- We have to watch the whole movie. - Look.

406
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,810
<9-24,Leonard>我们一直在拖延
<9-24,Leonard>We keep procrastinating.

407
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:05,290
<9-24,Leonard>我们看了《回到未来2》
<9-24,Leonard>We saw Back to the Future II,

408
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:06,490
<9-24,Leonard>鸽子打乒乓球
<9-24,Leonard>pigeons playing ping-pong,

409
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:08,390
<9-24,Leonard>一堆形状像男性生殖器的国家
<9-24,Leonard>a bunch of countries that look like genitals

410
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:11,680
<9-24,Leonard>还有一个生殖器形状像丹麦的家伙
<9-24,Leonard>and one guy whose genitals look like Denmark!

411
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:15,220
<9-25,Raj>抱歉我点了那个链接
<9-25,Raj>Yeah, sorry for clicking on that.

412
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:19,090
<9-26,Leonard>现在很晚了  我们浪费了几小时的时间
<9-26,Leonard>It's late. We've wasted hours.

413
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:20,670
<9-26,Leonard>拜托大家集中精神
<9-26,Leonard>Can we please find it in ourselves

414
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:22,640
<9-26,Leonard>今晚出点成果好吗
<9-26,Leonard>to do any amount of work tonight?

415
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,220
<9-27,Sheldon>但我们还没有看到他们捉住一只鬼呢
<9-27,Sheldon>But we didn't see them bust one ghost.

416
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:30,140
<9-28,Leonard>你是说我们应该在周六的晚上
<9-28,Leonard>So y-you're saying we should stand here

417
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,030
<9-28,Leonard>站在我的实验室里
<9-28,Leonard>in my lab on a Saturday night

418
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:35,170
<9-28,Leonard>用一台破笔记本看完《捉鬼敢死队》吗
<9-28,Leonard>and watch the rest of Ghostbusters on a crappy laptop?

419
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:36,460
<9-28,Leonard>不
<9-28,Leonard>No.

420
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:44,960
<10-1,All>上啊  敢死队
<10-1,All>Go, busters.

421
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:49,040
<10-2,Leonard>结果还真行啊
<10-2,Leonard>It really does hold up.

422
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:01,310
<11-1,Bernadette>瞧  这比在酒店房间好吧
<11-1,Bernadette>See? Isn't this better than a hotel room?

423
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:04,470
<11-2,Penny>是啊  把鸡鸡都甩起来
<11-2,Penny>Yep. Shake that thing!

424
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,510
<11-3,Bernadette>你见过这么赞的身躯吗
<11-3,Bernadette>Have you ever seen a body so fine?

425
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:11,280
<11-4,Amy>我的解剖课上也有些相当热辣的尸体
<11-4,Amy>We had some pretty hot corpses in my anatomy class,

426
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,720
<11-4,Amy>但没有一个能像这样蹦跶
<11-4,Amy>but none of them moved like that!

427
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:27,380
<11-4,Amy>早上好
<11-4,Amy>Good morning.

428
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,910
<11-4,Amy>要去游泳池吗
<11-4,Amy>You want to go to the pool?

429
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:34,500
<12-1,Penny>来嘛  你们自己也说过了
<12-1,Penny>Come on... you said it yourself.

430
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,860
<12-1,Penny>只有书呆和书虫才会待在房间里
<12-1,Penny>Only nerds and losers stay in the room.

431
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,030
<12-1,Penny>哇  好亮啊
<12-1,Penny>Wow, it's bright out.

432
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,260
<12-1,Penny>是不是好亮
<12-1,Penny>Isn't it bright?

433
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,940
<12-1,Penny>也许我应该拉上窗帘
<12-1,Penny>I should probably close these curtains.

434
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,170
<12-1,Penny>才怪  拜拜
<12-1,Penny>Nah. Bye!

435
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,440
<12-2,Bernadette>你去拉上窗帘好吗
<12-2,Bernadette>Would you please close the drapes?

436
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,150
<12-2,Bernadette>好的
<12-2,Bernadette>Okay.
