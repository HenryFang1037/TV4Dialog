1
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:04,920
<1-1,Penny>跟我说说你今天干了什么吧
<1-1,Penny>So, tell me about your day--

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,930
<1-1,Penny>粒子探测器的进展如何
<1-1,Penny>how's it going with the particle detector?

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,900
<1-2,Leonard>哇  你还记着这个
<1-2,Leonard>Wow! You remember that?

4
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,650
<1-3,Penny>当然  你的话我都有好好听
<1-3,Penny>Yeah, I listen to what you say.

5
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:11,910
<1-3,Penny>你正在用超流氦
<1-3,Penny>You're building a particle detector

6
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:13,790
<1-3,Penny>打造一个粒子探测器
<1-3,Penny>using superfluid helium.

7
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:15,650
<1-4,Leonard>你说这些的时候
<1-4,Leonard>You know, when you talk like that,

8
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:18,080
<1-4,Leonard>我真想立马把你按倒在这餐桌上
<1-4,Leonard>I want to take you right here on this table.

9
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:20,340
<1-5,Penny>根据以往的经验
<1-5,Penny>And you know from past experience

10
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,920
<1-5,Penny>这张桌子可承受不起我俩的重量
<1-5,Penny>this table cannot support both our weight.

11
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,540
<1-5,Penny>所以你那探测器做得怎么样了
<1-5,Penny>So, how's the detector going?

12
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:28,150
<1-6,Leonard>超流体这玩意还挺难搞
<1-6,Leonard>Well, it's tricky working with superfluids.

13
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:29,450
<1-6,Leonard>不管放进什么容器里
<1-6,Leonard>Whatever container you put them in,

14
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:30,980
<1-6,Leonard>它都会从边上渗出来
<1-6,Leonard>they kind of creep up the sides

15
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,670
<1-6,Leonard>慢慢逃逸掉
<1-6,Leonard>and crawl out all on their own.

16
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:34,340
<1-7,Penny>有点像谢尔顿的蚂蚁农场
<1-7,Penny>Kind of like Sheldon's ant farm.

17
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:37,640
<1-8,Leonard>完全正确  只是这次不会有个疯子在旁边
<1-8,Leonard>Exactly, except you don't have a lunatic running around,

18
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,440
<1-8,Leonard>边跳边喊  我喂了你们糖水喝  为毛要咬我
<1-8,Leonard>yelling, "I fed you sugar water, why are you biting me?"

19
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:44,260
<1-8,Leonard>这太无聊了  你不会真想谈这个吧
<1-8,Leonard>Come on, this is boring-- you really want to talk about this?

20
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:44,940
<1-9,Penny>我真的想听
<1-9,Penny>No, I do.

21
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,880
<1-9,Penny>我特意把超流氦写在
<1-9,Penny>I-I didn't write "superfluid helium"

22
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,160
<1-9,Penny>餐巾纸上可不是白费的
<1-9,Penny>on this napkin for nothing.

23
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,950
<1-9,Penny>好吧
<1-9,Penny>Okay, well...

24
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:51,910
<1-10,Leonard>有个想法挺有趣的
<1-10,Leonard>This is cool.

25
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:54,420
<1-10,Leonard>有一种理论叫超流体真空论
<1-10,Leonard>Uh, there's a thing called "superfluid vacuum theory",

26
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,450
<1-10,Leonard>它把时空本身设定为是一个具有各种特质的
<1-10,Leonard>where empty space is imagined as a superfluid

27
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:58,020
<1-10,Leonard>液态超流体
<1-10,Leonard>with all of its qualities--

28
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,240
<1-10,Leonard>粘度  密度  表面张力
<1-10,Leonard>viscosity, density, surface tension...

29
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,800
<1-11,Penny>如果你暂停是为了戏剧效果
<1-11,Penny>Hey, if you're pausing for dramatic effect,

30
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,710
<1-11,Penny>你还是继续说吧
<1-11,Penny>I'd keep it moving.

31
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:09,410
<1-11,Penny>不
<1-11,Penny>No, no.

32
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:14,090
<1-12,Leonard>其他人都没提到  表面张力
<1-12,Leonard>People don't talk about surface tension.

33
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:17,470
<1-12,Leonard>如果你把三维空间想象为
<1-12,Leonard>If you imagine our three-space as the surface

34
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:20,190
<1-12,Leonard>一个N维空间的超流体气泡的表面
<1-12,Leonard>of an N-dimensional superfluid bubble...

35
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,690
<1-12,Leonard>这个...这个想法太有趣了
<1-12,Leonard>This... is exciting.

36
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,450
<1-12,Leonard>真的很有意思
<1-12,Leonard>This is really exciting.

37
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,130
<1-12,Leonard>我得去找谢尔顿了
<1-12,Leonard>I have to go find Sheldon.

38
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:28,520
<1-13,Penny>如果你找到他
<1-13,Penny>Okay, well, if you find him,

39
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,800
<1-13,Penny>记得按倒到在厨房的岛台上...
<1-13,Penny>use the kitchen island--

40
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,520
<1-13,Penny>咖啡桌可承受不起你俩的重量
<1-13,Penny>that coffee table will not support both of you.

41
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,620
<2-1,Leonard>所以球性多维超流体
<2-1,Leonard>Which means a spherical multidimensional superfluid

42
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:40,060
<2-1,Leonard>和时空具有同样的负能量密度
<2-1,Leonard>shows the same negative-energy density as space-time.

43
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:42,300
<2-1,Leonard>你觉得如何  如何如何  你觉得如何
<2-1,Leonard>So what do you think? What do you think? So what do you think?

44
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,020
<2-3,Leonard>怎么了  我错了吗
<2-3,Leonard>What? Is it wrong?

45
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,800
<2-3,Leonard>还是你已经看过这种理论了
<2-3,Leonard>Have you seen it somewhere else?

46
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,890
<2-5,Leonard>我知道这不是我的领域
<2-5,Leonard>I know this isn't my area,

47
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:59,490
<2-5,Leonard>我的数学也没你强
<2-5,Leonard>and I could never do the math like you can,

48
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:01,640
<2-5,Leonard>但这想法靠谱吗
<2-5,Leonard>but could this be something...?

49
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,750
<2-5,Leonard>这个嘛
<2-5,Leonard>Well...

50
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,350
<2-6,Sheldon>你可以把牛顿的万有引力常数设为1
<2-6,Sheldon>You could have set Newton's gravitational constant to one.

51
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:10,750
<2-6,Sheldon>而且  到处都弥漫着一股蓝莓味
<2-6,Sheldon>And, ugh, the whole thing reeks of blueberry.

52
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:13,480
<2-6,Sheldon>我真是受不了这些香味记号笔
<2-6,Sheldon>You know I can't stand these scented markers.

53
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:16,870
<2-7,Leonard>又没人叫你吃它们
<2-7,Leonard>No one told you to taste them.

54
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:20,860
<2-7,Leonard>这个想法到底好不好嘛
<2-7,Leonard>Come on, is-is this good or not?

55
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:23,400
<2-8,Sheldon>很不错
<2-8,Sheldon>It's good.

56
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,910
<2-9,Leonard>-真的吗  -我很看好它
<2-9,Leonard>- Really? - I like it.

57
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,190
<2-10,Sheldon>我觉得这可能是个大发现
<2-10,Sheldon>I think you're on to something.

58
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,460
<2-11,Leonard>真的吗  你没有逗我吧
<2-11,Leonard>You do? You're not messing with me?

59
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:28,940
<2-12,Sheldon>完全没有
<2-12,Sheldon>Not at all.

60
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,230
<2-12,Sheldon>事实上  我为这种时刻
<2-12,Sheldon>In fact, I have got something

61
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,450
<2-12,Sheldon>专门准备了一个东西
<2-12,Sheldon>for just such an occasion.

62
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:33,600
<2-12,Sheldon>我还以为自己
<2-12,Sheldon>I was starting to think

63
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,580
<2-12,Sheldon>不会有机会把这个给你了呢
<2-12,Sheldon>I might never get a chance to give it to you.

64
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:37,490
<2-12,Sheldon>表现不错
<2-12,Sheldon>Good job.

65
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:43,640
<2-13,Leonard>你给了我一张贴纸
<2-13,Leonard>You're giving me a sticker?

66
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,530
<2-13,Leonard>是的
<2-13,Leonard>Indeed.

67
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,540
<2-14,Sheldon>但远不止贴纸那么简单
<2-14,Sheldon>Not just a sticker.

68
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:50,310
<2-14,Sheldon>贴纸上有只猫在说  干得喵
<2-14,Sheldon>That is a sticker of a kitty saying, "Me-wow!"

69
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:54,740
<2-15,Leonard>我又不是幼儿园小孩儿
<2-15,Leonard>I'm not a preschooler.

70
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,240
<2-16,Sheldon>那我把它收回吧
<2-16,Sheldon>Fine, I'll take it back.

71
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,150
<2-17,Leonard>这是我应得的  别想拿走
<2-17,Leonard>I earned this! Back off!

78
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,060
<3-1,Leonard>你还没睡啊
<3-1,Leonard>You're still awake?

79
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:29,860
<3-2,Sheldon>身为一个刚刚发现
<3-2,Sheldon>For a man whose last observation was

80
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,440
<3-2,Sheldon>宇宙时空可能是
<3-2,Sheldon>our universe may be the surface

81
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,720
<3-2,Sheldon>一个多维超冷液体的表面的人
<3-2,Sheldon>of a multidimensional supercooled liquid,

82
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,770
<3-2,Sheldon>"你还没睡啊"是小学二年级才会问的问题
<3-2,Sheldon>"You're still awake" seems like quite the sophomore slump.

83
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:40,550
<3-3,Leonard>你完成了所有的计算
<3-3,Leonard>You worked out all the math.

84
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:43,160
<3-4,Sheldon>我做的可不止计算
<3-4,Sheldon>Oh, I did more than work out all the math.

85
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,450
<3-6,Sheldon>我写了一篇论文
<3-6,Sheldon>I wrote a paper.

86
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,740
<3-5,Leonard>你用我的想法写了一篇论文吗
<3-5,Leonard>You wrote a paper on my idea?

87
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,050
<3-6,Sheldon>我用我们的想法写了一篇论文
<3-6,Sheldon>I wrote a paper on our idea.

88
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,400
<3-7,Leonard>我的想法什么时候成了我们的想法
<3-7,Leonard>When did my idea become our idea?

89
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:56,790
<3-8,Sheldon>当我在其中糅合了谢尔顿的精华
<3-8,Sheldon>When I mixed it with Sheldony goodness

90
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:00,430
<3-8,Sheldon>并用我的思维烤箱烘焙而成后
<3-8,Sheldon>and cooked it in the Easy-Bake Oven of my mind.

91
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,550
<3-9,Leonard>写得真不错
<3-9,Leonard>This is good.

92
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,940
<3-9,Leonard>我们的想法真得很不错
<3-9,Leonard>Our idea is really good.

93
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:10,280
<3-10,Sheldon>人家烤箱里面的小灯泡可以亮瞎你的眼呢
<3-10,Sheldon>Well, the lightbulb in this oven is ridiculously bright.

94
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,170
<3-11,Leonard>如果这个想法没有人提出过
<3-11,Leonard>You know, if no one's thought of this, yet,

95
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,040
<3-11,Leonard>这绝对是个大发现啊
<3-11,Leonard>this could be a big deal.

96
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,400
<3-12,Sheldon>检验的唯一方法就是
<3-12,Sheldon>Only way we'll know for sure is

97
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,760
<3-12,Sheldon>把它放到预发表服务器上去
<3-12,Sheldon>if we post it online to the pre-print server.

98
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:22,220
<3-12,Sheldon>我已经准备发了  但我要等你一起来
<3-12,Sheldon>I have it ready to go, but I wasn't gonna do it without you.

99
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,710
<3-13,Leonard>这一切发生得太快了
<3-13,Leonard>Wow, it's all happening so fast.

100
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:29,360
<3-13,Leonard>我们要不要等明天再说啊
<3-13,Leonard>Should we just sleep on it?

101
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,730
<3-14,Sheldon>可以  但也许其他人
<3-14,Sheldon>We could, but we always run the risk

102
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,790
<3-14,Sheldon>就会抢在我们前面了
<3-14,Sheldon>of someone else beating us to the punch.

103
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:36,290
<3-15,Leonard>你确定这个想法靠谱吗
<3-15,Leonard>You're sure it's good?

104
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,660
<3-16,Sheldon>我的名字就在你旁边
<3-16,Sheldon>My name is right on there with yours.

105
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:41,670
<3-16,Sheldon>这就是金牌品质保证
<3-16,Sheldon>That is a surefire mark of quality.

106
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,450
<3-16,Sheldon>这就好比由乔斯·威登执导的电影
<3-16,Sheldon>That might as well say "Directed by Joss Whedon".

108
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:51,050
<3-17,Leonard>好吧  搭档  就这么干吧
<3-17,Leonard>Okay, partner, let's do it.

109
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,600
<3-17,Leonard>来
<3-17,Leonard>Come on.

110
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:56,730
<3-18,Sheldon>和我一起按下鼠标吧
<3-18,Sheldon>Click the mouse with me.

111
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:01,880
<3-19,Leonard>1
<3-19,Leonard>One...

112
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:03,890
<3-19,Leonard>2
<3-19,Leonard>two...

113
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,450
<3-19,Leonard>3
<3-19,Leonard>three...

114
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:06,600
<3-20,Together>点击
<3-20,Together>Click.

115
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,640
<3-21,Leonard>好了  我们真的做了
<3-21,Leonard>Well, we did it.

116
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,980
<3-22,Sheldon>是的  我的朋友
<3-22,Sheldon>Yes, we did, my friend.

117
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:15,090
<3-23,Leonard>你的舌头怎么是蓝色的
<3-23,Leonard>Is your tongue blue?

118
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:16,510
<3-24,Sheldon>我不想谈这件事
<3-24,Sheldon>I don't want to talk about it.

119
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,880
<4-1,Bernadette>电影之夜  你们想看什么
<4-1,Bernadette>Okay, movie night-- what do you want to watch?

120
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,860
<4-2,Amy>你出演的那部猿人电影怎么样了
<4-2,Amy>Whatever happened to that ape movie you were in?

121
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,140
<4-3,Penny>天啊
<4-3,Penny>Oh, God.

122
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,000
<4-3,Penny>可能根本没发行
<4-3,Penny>Probably nothing.

123
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:28,890
<4-3,Penny>我好像看到导演在手机通讯行外面转广告牌呢
<4-3,Penny>I think I saw the director twirling a sign outside the Verizon store.

124
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,660
<4-4,Bernadette>搜搜看
<4-4,Bernadette>Search for it.

125
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,330
<4-5,Penny>什么  不  为什么啊
<4-5,Penny>Wha... no. No! Why?

126
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:33,750
<4-6,Bernadette>因为一定很好玩
<4-6,Bernadette>'Cause it would be fun to watch.

127
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,370
<4-7,Penny>我一定会丢脸死
<4-7,Penny>It would be humiliating.

128
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,090
<4-8,Bernadette>现在我们有两个理由了
<4-8,Bernadette>Well, now we have two reasons.

129

130
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,860
<4-10,Bernadette>求求你了  让我们看吧
<4-10,Bernadette>Please, can we watch it?

131
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:42,810
<4-11,Amy>拜托了
<4-11,Amy>Please?

132
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:45,120
<4-12,Penny>好吧  不过我警告你们  超级难看
<4-12,Penny>Fine, but I'm telling you-- it's terrible.

133
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,370
<4-13,Amy>-你自己看过吗  -没有
<4-13,Amy>- Have you even seen it? - No.

134
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:49,360
<4-15,Bernadette>也许比你想得好多了
<4-15,Bernadette>Well, maybe it turned out better than you think.

<5-1,Leonard>谢尔顿  这是超流氦
<5-1,Leonard>Sheldon, this is superfluid helium.

138
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,670
<5-1,Leonard>把这个放到嘴巴里
<5-1,Leonard>Put this in your mouth,

00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,770
<5-1,Leonard>你的舌头就会冻成碎片
<5-1,Leonard>your tongue will freeze and break off.

140
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,340
<5-2,Sheldon>它闻起来像蓝莓吗
<5-2,Sheldon>Does it smell like blueberries?

141
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,280
<5-3,Leonard>不像
<5-3,Leonard>No.

142
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:13,580
<5-4,Sheldon>那就应该没问题了
<5-4,Sheldon>Then we're probably okay.

143
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:16,020
<5-5,Howard>你们的论文被
<5-5,Howard>Hey, your paper got mentioned

144

147
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:22,240
<5-7,Howard>只是简单地介绍了一下这个理论
<5-7,Howard>Uh, it's basically a summary of the theory,

148
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,020
<5-7,Howard>不过下面有好多正面留言
<5-7,Howard>but there's a bunch of positive comments on the message board.

<6-2,Doctor>Why do you think you're turning into a killer gorilla

197
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,360
<6-2,Doctor>而不是普通猩猩呢
<6-2,Doctor>and not just a regular gorilla?

198
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:33,290
<6-3,Penny (on television)>因为普通猩猩是吃素的
<6-3,Penny (on television)>Because regular gorillas are vegetarians,

<8-7,Bernadette>抱歉  我得把注意力从我身上转移
<8-7,Bernadette>Sorry, I had to get the spotlight off me,

246
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,720
<8-7,Bernadette>攻击其他女生是我接受的选美特训内容之一
<8-7,Bernadette>and tearing down other women is part of my pageant training.

247
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:57,370
<8-8,Penny>好的  我们现在就看
<8-8,Penny>Okay. We are reading that right now.

248
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:58,620
<8-9,Amy>拜托别看
<8-9,Amy>No, please don't.

249
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,390
<8-10,Bernadette>反正今晚都丢人了  来吧
<8-10,Bernadette>We got embarrassed tonight. Come on.

250
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:01,640
<8-11,Amy>但这是隐私
<8-11,Amy>But it's personal.

251
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,690
<8-12,Penny>为什么  是写的你和谢尔顿吗
<8-12,Penny>Why? Is it about you and Sheldon?

252
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,130
<8-13,Amy>不是
<8-13,Amy>No.

253
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,790
<8-14,Penny>老天  是她和谢尔顿的事
<8-14,Penny>Oh, my God, it's about her and Sheldon.

254
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:09,700
<8-15,Amy>不是我和谢尔顿的事
<8-15,Amy>It's not about me and Sheldon.

255
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:13,540
<8-15,Amy>女主是19世纪名叫艾米莉亚的年轻女生
<8-15,Amy>It's about a young woman in the 1800s named Amelia...

256
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:16,400
<8-15,Amy>她爱上了穿越时空的
<8-15,Amy>and the time-traveling physicist named Cooper

257
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:17,610
<8-15,Amy>名叫库珀的物理学家
<8-15,Amy>she falls in love with.

258
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:20,350
<8-16,Penny>-拜托给我们看看  -拜托
<8-16,Penny>- Please show us? - Please?

259
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:22,920
<8-19,Penny>-不  -你应该知道无论怎样我们都会看的
<8-19,Penny>- No. - You know I'm gonna read it either way.

260
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,480
<8-20,Amy>希望你运气好能找到
<8-20,Amy>Good luck finding it.

261
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,480
<8-21,Penny>艾米莉亚和
<8-21,Penny>Amelia and...

262
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,280
<8-21,Penny>穿越时...
<8-21,Penny>the time-trav...

263
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,210
<8-21,Penny>找到了
<8-21,Penny>Found it!

264
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,160
<8-21,Penny>"草原的黎明刚过
<8-21,Penny>"It was just past dawn on the prairie,

265
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,240
<8-21,Penny>和其它早上一样
<8-21,Penny>and like every morning,

266
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,300
<8-21,Penny>艾米莉亚准备做家务活
<8-21,Penny>Amelia prepared to do her chores.

267
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:40,200
<8-21,Penny>只是今早感觉有些不同"
<8-21,Penny>Except something about this morning felt different."

268
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,480
<8-22,Bernadette>为什么
<8-22,Bernadette>Why?

269
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:46,200
<8-22,Bernadette>为什么感觉不同了
<8-22,Bernadette>Why did it feel different?

270
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,640
<8-23,Penny>"也许是因为空气中响过冬天的第一声低语
<8-23,Penny>"Maybe it was the first whisper of winter in the air,

271
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,210
<8-23,Penny>也许是因为她即将发现的
<8-23,Penny>o maybe it was the unconscious handsome man

272
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:55,160
<8-23,Penny>躺在草地上  有着瓷器一样精致的皮肤
<8-23,Penny>with porcelain skin and curious clothing

273
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,810
<8-23,Penny>以及穿着古怪衣衫的英俊男子
<8-23,Penny>she was about to discover lying in the field.

274
00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:00,700
<8-23,Penny>这个男人将开拓她的思想至无限可能
<8-23,Penny>A man who would open her mind to new possibilities

275
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,720
<8-23,Penny>也会让她的身体领略未知的感受"
<8-23,Penny>and her body to new feelings."

276
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:13,610
<8-24,Amy>曾经我很孤独  没有朋友
<8-24,Amy>You know, there was a time when I was alone and had no friends.

277
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,490
<8-24,Amy>我开始想念那种时光了
<8-24,Amy>I'm starting to miss that.

278
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:20,710
<9-1,Sheldon>他还是没回复
<9-1,Sheldon>He still hasn't responded.

279
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:22,010
<9-1,Sheldon>他怎么这么慢
<9-1,Sheldon>What's taking him so long?

280
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:23,650
<9-2,Leonard>你真的想要他回复吗
<9-2,Leonard>Do you really want him to write back?

281
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:26,180
<9-3,Sheldon>是的  无论他回复什么
<9-3,Sheldon>Yeah, I do. No matter how he responds,

282
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:30,160
<9-3,Sheldon>我都打算用一只一脸不屑的猫
<9-3,Sheldon>I am going to destroy him with a picture of a bored cat

283
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,150
<9-3,Sheldon>说"哦  真的喵"的图来羞辱他
<9-3,Sheldon>saying, "Oh, really?"

284
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:38,940
<9-4,Leonard>干得喵
<9-4,Leonard>Me-wow.

285
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:42,850
<9-5,Howard>你做什么
<9-5,Howard>What are you doing?

286
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,450
<9-6,Raj>我注册了一些小号
<9-6,Raj>I've, uh, created some other user accounts

287
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:48,120
<9-6,Raj>这样可以赞美他们的论文
<9-6,Raj>so I can post positive comments about their paper.

288
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,990
<9-7,Howard>"这小孩家家的理论
<9-7,Howard>"This wee li'l bairn of a theory

<9-7,Howard>nearly blew my kilt off"?

290
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:56,240
<9-8,Raj>不  你应该像爱丁堡大学的
<9-8,Raj>No. You have to read it how Dr. Angus McDoogal

291
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,830
<9-8,Raj>安格斯·麦克多戈尔博士那样读
<9-8,Raj>of the University of Edinburgh would.

<9-7,Howard>nearly blew me kilt off."

294
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:07,010
<9-9,Sheldon>他回复了
<9-9,Sheldon>He wrote back!

295
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,430
<9-9,Sheldon>"库霍氏求助于幼稚的玩笑话
<9-9,Sheldon>"Cooper and Hofstadter resorting to juvenile attempts at humor

296
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:15,010
<9-9,Sheldon>证明了他们没有可支持他们可笑论文的东西"
<9-9,Sheldon>Is proof they have nothing to back up their ridiculous paper.

297
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:16,570
<9-9,Sheldon>这一点也不奇怪
<9-9,Sheldon>It should come as no surprise

298
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:20,230
<9-9,Sheldon>考虑到他们所在的加州理工  本质上是技术学院
<9-9,Sheldon>Given they work at Cal Tech, essentially a technical school,

299

<9-9,Sheldon>那里的物理学家从根本上来说就只是工程师"
<9-9,Sheldon>where even the physicists are basically engineers."

300
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,950
<9-9,Sheldon>"工程师"
<9-9,Sheldon>"Engineers"!

301
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:30,270
<9-9,Sheldon>知道这有多侮辱人吗
<9-9,Sheldon>Do you know how insulting that is?

302
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:31,870
<9-10,Howard>知道
<9-10,Howard>Yes.

303
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,480
<9-11,Raj>各位  这家伙只是想尽办法
<9-11,Raj>Guys, this person's just going out of their way

304
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,750
<9-11,Raj>来激怒你们
<9-11,Raj>to get a rise out of you.

305
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,590
<9-12,Sheldon>没错  但还是气死人
<9-12,Sheldon>Yeah, but it's still so aggravating.

306
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,970
<9-13,Raj>其它的评论都是正面的溢美之词
<9-13,Raj>Yeah, well, all the other comments said really nice things.

307
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:42,730
<9-13,Raj>-看那些就行了  -没错
<9-13,Raj>- Focus on those. - Yeah.

308
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:47,490
<9-14,Howard>莫斯科大学的迪米崔·普兰克维克博士说

<9-14,Howard>入口柔  一线喉  劲过伏特加"
<9-14,Howard>I love it more than 'wodka.".

311
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:55,410
<9-15,Raj>懂吗  配上口音才有感觉
<9-15,Raj>See? Better with the accent.

312
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,540
<9-16,Sheldon>然后...发送
<9-16,Sheldon>And... send.

313
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,600
<9-17,Leonard>你写的什么
<9-17,Leonard>What did you write?

314
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,220
<9-18,Sheldon>我受够了躲避恶霸的日子
<9-18,Sheldon>I'm done hiding from bullies.

315
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:02,950
<9-18,Sheldon>我要在现实生活中勇敢面对
<9-18,Sheldon>I'm taking this into the real world.

316
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:03,710
<9-19,Leonard>那是什么意思
<9-19,Leonard>What does that mean?

317
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,650
<9-20,Sheldon>我告诉他  我愿意在任何时间
<9-20,Sheldon>I told him we'll meet him face-to-face

318
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:06,990
<9-20,Sheldon>任何地点  跟他见面
<9-20,Sheldon>anytime, anywhere.

319
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:09,000
<9-21,Leonard>你疯了吗  你都不认识这个人
<9-21,Leonard>Are you crazy? You don't know who this person is.

320
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,580
<9-22,Raj>-快删掉  -快点  谢尔顿
<9-22,Raj>- Delete that! - Come on, Sheldon!

321
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,970
<9-23,Sheldon>好啦  好啦  冷静
<9-23,Sheldon>Oh, okay, okay, calm down.

322
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:16,900
<9-23,Sheldon>是他
<9-23,Sheldon>It's him!

323
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:19,210
<9-23,Sheldon>他想视频聊天
<9-23,Sheldon>He's trying to video chat.

324
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:25,850
<9-23,Sheldon>也许我不应该把事惹到现实生活中来
<9-23,Sheldon>Perhaps I shouldn't have taken this into the real world.

325
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:29,000
<9-24,Leonard>哦  真的喵
<9-24,Leonard>Oh, really?

326
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:34,280
<10-1,Penny>'"时间旅行"我不理解'  艾米莉亚说
<10-1,Penny>'"Time travel? I don't understand,' "Said Amelia.

327
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,600
<10-1,Penny>库珀盯着她说
<10-1,Penny>Cooper stared at her.

328
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,590
<10-1,Penny>'哪部分你不理解  "时间"还是"旅行"'
<10-1,Penny>'Which rd don't you understand, time or travel?'"

329
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,190
<10-2,Bernadette>连你幻想里的谢尔顿都这么让人心塞
<10-2,Bernadette>Wow, even in your fantasies Sheldon's kind of exhausting.

330
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,250
<10-3,Amy>他是在开头才这样
<10-3,Amy>He's like that in the beginning,

331
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,910
<10-3,Amy>方便她来改变他
<10-3,Amy>so she can change him.

332
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,440
<10-3,Amy>这叫写作功力
<10-3,Amy>It's called good writing.

333
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:52,130
<10-3,Amy>也叫有梦最美
<10-3,Amy>And wishful thinking.

334
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:54,680
<10-4,Penny>"艾米莉亚非常受伤"
<10-4,Penny>"It stung Amelia "

335
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,810
<10-4,Penny>在她听到他用那种方式说话时
<10-4,Penny>When he spoke to her this way.

336
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:57,240
<10-4,Penny>"在她那间小小的学校中
<10-4,Penny>In her little one-room schoolhouse,

337
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,830
<10-4,Penny>她一直是最聪明的学生
<10-4,Penny>she was always the smartest student,

338
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,990
<10-4,Penny>常常傲视班里被她击败的男生们
<10-4,Penny>regularly besting the boys in her class,

339
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:02,810
<10-4,Penny>但眼前的人  并不是男生
<10-4,Penny>but this was no boy in front of her--

340
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:04,090
<10-4,Penny>而是一个男人"
<10-4,Penny>"This was a man.

341
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:04,920
<10-5,Bernadette>好戏来了
<10-5,Bernadette>Here we go.

342
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,320
<10-6,Penny>"库珀给艾米莉亚
<10-6,Penny>"Cooper told Amelia

343
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,970
<10-6,Penny>讲了许多未来可以拥有的
<10-6,Penny>about all the strange and incredible things

344
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:10,710
<10-6,Penny>陌生而又神奇的东西  比如电脑
<10-6,Penny>the future would hold, like computers

345
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,200
<10-6,Penny>还有可以活过30岁
<10-6,Penny>and living past 30.

346
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:14,820
<10-6,Penny>他问她有没有什么问题要问
<10-6,Penny>He asked her if she had any questions.

347
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,090
<10-6,Penny>她只渴望听到一个问题的答案
<10-6,Penny>All she longed to ask was

348
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:18,390
<10-6,Penny>就是他的心是否和自己一样跳得飞快
<10-6,Penny>if his heart was beating as fast as hers,

349
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:20,810
<10-6,Penny>但她又害怕听到答案"
<10-6,Penny>but she was too afraid to hear the answer."

350
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,240
<10-7,Bernadette>艾米莉亚真可怜
<10-7,Bernadette>Oh, Amelia.

351
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,180
<10-8,Penny>"取而代之  她问的是
<10-8,Penny>"So instead she asked if, in the future,

352
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,510
<10-8,Penny>在未来  蒙大拿有没有成为一个州"
<10-8,Penny>montana ever became a state."

353
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:33,510
<10-9,Amy>在十九世纪这就算调情了
<10-9,Amy>In the 1800s that was considered flirting.

354
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,480
<11-1,Raj>我受够了人们在网上总是那么毒舌
<11-1,Raj>I'm so sick of people being mean on the Internet.

355
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,280
<11-2,Howard>我觉得匿名使得人们以为
<11-2,Howard>Well, I think the anonymity makes everyone feel like

356
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,910
<11-2,Howard>可以乱说那些当面说不出口的话了
<11-2,Howard>they can say things they'd never say to your face.

357
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,750
<11-3,Sheldon>有意思
<11-3,Sheldon>Interesting.

358
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,680
<11-3,Sheldon>我想不出有什么话
<11-3,Sheldon>I can't think of a single thing

359
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,590
<11-3,Sheldon>是我不能当面说出口的
<11-3,Sheldon>I wouldn't say to someone's face.

360
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,590
<11-4,Leonard>这点我们还真"没注意到"呢
<11-4,Leonard>Never noticed that about you.

361
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,210
<11-5,Raj>知道吗  至少你们做出了成果
<11-5,Raj>You know what? A-At least you guys did something.

362
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:01,340
<11-5,Raj>你们想到了这个理论
<11-5,Raj>You know, you-you had a theory,

363

<11-5,Raj>切切实实地作出了贡献
<11-5,Raj>you made an actual contribution.

365
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:08,340
<11-5,Raj>做那种的事的人只会对别人的作品指指点点
<11-5,Raj>All guys like this do is just stand on other people's work.

366
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,540
<11-5,Raj>他说得对
<11-5,Raj>He's right.

367
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:14,830
<11-6,Sheldon>要不我们给他打回去
<11-6,Sheldon>I say we call this person back.

368
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:17,060
<11-6,Sheldon>我们又用不着躲躲藏藏的
<11-6,Sheldon>We've got no reason to hide.

375
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,610
<11-10,Sheldon>霍金教授
<11-10,Sheldon>Professor Hawking?

376
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:44,370
<11-11,Stephen Hawking>哥们儿  照镜子瞅瞅你那什么表情啊
<11-11,Stephen Hawking>Oh, brother, you should see the look on your faces.

377
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,880
<11-12,Leonard>你真不喜欢我们的论文吗
<11-12,Leonard>You really didn't like our paper?

378
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,440
<11-13,Stephen Hawking>我非常喜欢你们的论文
<11-13,Stephen Hawking>I like your paper very much.

379
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:54,010
<11-13,Stephen Hawking>这个假设很有趣
<11-13,Stephen Hawking>The premise is intriguing.

380
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:56,750
<11-14,Sheldon>那你为什么还要攻击我们
<11-14,Sheldon>Then why are you attacking us?

381
00:16:56,810 --> 00:17:00,020
<11-15,Stephen Hawking>如果你在椅子里被困了四十年
<11-15,Stephen Hawking>If you were sitting in a chair for 40 years,

382
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,840
<11-15,Stephen Hawking>你也会觉得无聊的
<11-15,Stephen Hawking>you'd get bored, too.

383
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:05,390
<11-15,Stephen Hawking>总之
<11-15,Stephen Hawking>Anyway,

384
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:06,380
<11-15,Stephen Hawking>我得走了
<11-15,Stephen Hawking>got to go.

385
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:10,520
<11-15,Stephen Hawking>答应给邻居家小孩补数学课
<11-15,Stephen Hawking>I promised to help the neighbor kid with his math homework.

<11-20,Raj>好  你一直故意下套害我像白痴
<11-20,Raj>Yeah, you keep setting me up for failure.

394
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:45,800
<12-1,Penny>"带着沉重的心情
<12-1,Penny>"With a heavy heart,

395
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,430
<12-1,Penny>艾米莉亚站在刚修好的时间机器前
<12-1,Penny>Amelia stood before the newly repaired time machine.

396
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:50,990
<12-1,Penny>她后悔把库珀需要的部分给他了
<12-1,Penny>She regretted giving Cooper the part he needed."

397
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:54,190
<12-2,Bernadette>因为她想的是他能交出她需要的那"部分"
<12-2,Bernadette>Because she wanted him to give her the part she needed.

398
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,620
<12-3,Amy>-行了  够了  -怎么了
<12-3,Amy>- Okay, that's enough. - What?

399
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:00,210
<12-4,Penny>不要啊  我真的很想知道后来怎么了...
<12-4,Penny>No! I really want to know what happens--

400
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:00,890
<12-4,Penny>还有伯纳黛特
<12-4,Penny>and Bernadette

<12-4,Penny>真滴  真滴  真滴想知道  后来怎么了嘛
<12-4,Penny>really, really, really wants to know what happens.

402
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,810
<12-5,Amy>你们就是在拿我取乐
<12-5,Amy>You're just making fun of me.

403
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:08,510
<12-6,Bernadette>我刚刚是在开玩笑的  抱歉
<12-6,Bernadette>I was just kidding. I'm sorry.

404
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:09,990
<12-6,Bernadette>这个故事写得真的很好
<12-6,Bernadette>And the story's really good!

405
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:11,960
<12-7,Penny>就是啊  他有没有留下
<12-7,Penny>No, it is! Does he stay?

406
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,920
<12-7,Penny>他们接吻了吗  她最后知道蒙大拿的事了吗
<12-7,Penny>Do they kiss? Does she find out about Montana?

407
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:17,830
<12-8,Bernadette>拜托
<12-8,Bernadette>Please?

408
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,530
<12-8,Bernadette>好吧
<12-8,Bernadette>Fine.

409
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:24,020
<12-9,Amy>"在库珀准备起飞时
<12-9,Amy>"As Cooper prepared to depart,

410
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,270
<12-9,Amy>泪水溢满了艾米莉亚的眼睛
<12-9,Amy>Tears filled Amelia's eyes.

411
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:30,610
<12-9,Amy>他拉起她的手说'我不能留下来
<12-9,Amy>he took her hand in his and said, 'I can't stay,

412
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,460
<12-9,Amy>但我永远都不会忘记你的'
<12-9,Amy>but I will never forget you.'

413
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,320
<12-9,Amy>他的手指轻轻抚过她的脸颊
<12-9,Amy>He brushed his fingers against her cheek,

414
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:37,500
<12-9,Amy>然后快步地走入机器
<12-9,Amy>then quickly stepped into the machine.

415
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,280
<12-9,Amy>'请不要离开'  她呢喃道
<12-9,Amy>'Please don't go,' she whispered.

416
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:42,180
<12-9,Amy>但一切都已经太晚了
<12-9,Amy>But it was too late.

417
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:44,130
<12-9,Amy>引擎呼啸着启动了"
<12-9,Amy>The engine hummed to life."

418
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,260
<12-10,Bernadette>但他们还没有接过吻啊
<12-10,Bernadette>But they didn't even kiss.

419
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:48,260
<12-11,Amy>"她转过身去
<12-11,Amy>"She turned away,

420
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,670
<12-11,Amy>抹掉眼中的泪水
<12-11,Amy>wiping her eyes.

421
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,300
<12-11,Amy>她无法忍受眼睁睁看着
<12-11,Amy>She couldn't bear to watch

422
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:54,380
<12-11,Amy>自己的一生所爱永远地消失离开
<12-11,Amy>her one chance at true love disappear forever.

423
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:55,380
<12-11,Amy>然后...
<12-11,Amy>Then...

424
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,560
<12-11,Amy>她感到一只强壮的手搭在自己的肩头
<12-11,Amy>she felt a strong hand on her shoulder

425
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,070
<12-11,Amy>将她扳回身去
<12-11,Amy>spin her around.

426
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,730
<12-11,Amy>是库珀"
<12-11,Amy>it was Cooper."

427
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,450
<12-12,Penny>太棒了
<12-12,Penny>Yes!

428
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:07,180
<12-13,Amy>"'未来怎么办'  艾米莉亚问道
<12-13,Amy>"'What about the future?' asked Amelia.

429
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:10,280
<12-13,Amy>他深深地注视着她的双眸  轻声说
<12-13,Amy>He looked deeply into her eyes and whispered,

430
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,990
<12-13,Amy>'没有你就没有未来'
<12-13,Amy>'There is no future without you.'

431
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:15,330
<12-13,Amy>他一把将她拉近
<12-13,Amy>He pulled her in close.

432
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,050
<12-13,Amy>她的身体开始颤抖
<12-13,Amy>She began to tremble all over.

433
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:20,450
<12-13,Amy>能感受到他温暖的呼吸..."
<12-13,Amy>She felt his warm breath..."

434
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:21,930
<12-14,Leonard>你们肯定不信刚刚史蒂芬·霍金说什么了
<12-14,Leonard>You will not believe what Stephen Hawking just said.

435
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:23,860
<12-16,Bernadette>-滚  -出去
<12-16,Bernadette>- Get out!  - Not now!

436
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,570
<13-1,Amelia>水够热吗
<13-1,Amelia>Is the water warm enough?

437
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:41,310
<13-2,Cooper>考虑到你花时间烧柴生火
<13-2,Cooper>Given the fact that you took the time to build a wood fire,

438
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:43,690
<13-2,Cooper>从井里打水又烧热
<13-2,Cooper>draw the water from the well and heat it,

439
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:46,420
<13-2,Cooper>如果我再抱怨就太无礼了
<13-2,Cooper>it would be rude to complain.

440
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,120
<13-2,Cooper>但既然你都问了  有点儿冷
<13-2,Cooper>But since you asked, it's a little nippy.

441
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:53,500
<13-3,Amelia>我能解决
<13-3,Amelia>I can fix that.

442
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:02,870
<13-3,Amelia>我很难不注意到你那不同寻常的贴身衣物
<13-3,Amelia>I couldn't help but notice your unusual undergarments.

443
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:05,020
<13-4,Cooper>那不是贴身衣物
<13-4,Cooper>They're not undergarments.

444
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:07,500
<13-4,Cooper>那是小裤裤
<13-4,Cooper>They're Underoos.

445
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:10,850
<13-4,Cooper>我来的地方把这个叫做
<13-4,Cooper>Where I come from, they're known as

446
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:13,440
<13-4,Cooper>"又酷又好玩的裤"
<13-4,Cooper>"Underwear that's fun to wear."

447
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,320
<13-5,Amelia>那蜘蛛的意义又是什么
<13-5,Amelia>And what's the significance of the spider?

448
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,140
<13-6,Cooper>那代表着蜘蛛侠
<13-6,Cooper>Oh, that represents Spider-Man.

449
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,800
<13-6,Cooper>蜘蛛能干啥  他就能干啥
<13-6,Cooper>He does whatever a spider can.

450
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,040
<13-7,Amelia>未来说话都很押韵是吧
<13-7,Amelia>There's a lot of rhyming in the future, isn't there?

451
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:30,850
<13-7,Amelia>你说得对
<13-7,Amelia>You're right.

452
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:33,710
<13-8,Leonard (in bed)>比我想得更诡异
<13-8,Leonard (in bed)>This is even weirder than I thought.

453
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,160
<13-9,Penny>要不要我停下
<13-9,Penny>You want me to stop reading?

454
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,250
<13-10,Leonard>开什么玩笑  继续  继续
<13-10,Leonard>Are you kidding? No, no.

455
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,640
<13-11,Penny>"他站起身来  方便她擦干身体..."
<13-11,Penny>"As he stood for Amelia to dry him..."

456
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:47,850
<13-12,Amelia>告诉我  库珀...
<13-12,Amelia>So, tell me, Cooper...

457
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:53,160
<13-12,Amelia>未来肌肤相亲的方式也不同吗
<13-12,Amelia>are the ways of physical love different in the future?

458
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,470
<13-13,Leonard>够了  我听够了
<13-13,Leonard>Yeah, okay, I'm good.
