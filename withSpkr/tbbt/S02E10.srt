1
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:06,810
<1-1,Steph>我什么都没看到  谢尔顿
<1-1,Steph>I don't see anything at all, Sheldon.

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:10,680
<1-2,Sheldon>你是医生我听你的  但确实 老有烦人的声音在我耳边响
<1-2,Sheldon>Well, you're the doctor, but I am constantly hearing this annoying sound.

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,180
<1-3,Leonard>没错
<1-3,Leonard>Me, too.

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,080
<1-4,Sheldon>是一种高频的口哨声吗
<1-4,Sheldon>Is it a high-frequency whistle?

5
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:18,080
<1-5,Leonard>不  是一种时刻不停的
<1-5,Leonard>No, it's more of a relentless,

6
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,710
<1-5,Leonard>自以为是的唠叨
<1-5,Leonard>narcissistic drone.

7
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:23,550
<1-6,Steph>没有任何炎症  谢尔顿
<1-6,Steph>Yup, there's no inflammation at all, Sheldon.

8
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:26,850
<1-7,Sheldon>那我肯定得肿瘤了
<1-7,Sheldon>Then it must be a tumor.

9
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,450
<1-8,Steph>我深表怀疑
<1-8,Steph>I Seriously doubt it.

10
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:31,450
<1-9,Leonard>也许是以前小时候常把头塞进马桶冲水
<1-9,Leonard>Maybe it's a lingering bacterial infection

11
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:33,680
<1-9,Leonard>造成的永久性细菌感染
<1-9,Leonard>from all those childhood toilet swirlies.

12
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:38,410
<1-10,Sheldon>真的会这样吗  我以前经常这么干的
<1-10,Sheldon>Is that possible? I used to get those all the time.

13
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,150
<1-10,Sheldon>甚至在教堂里
<1-10,Sheldon>Even in church.

14
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:45,110
<1-11,Steph>如果是因为这个的话  我倒有个办法
<1-11,Steph>Well if it is from a swirly, there something I can do.

15
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,980
<1-11,Steph>圈  圈  点  点
<1-11,Steph>Okay, circle, circle, dot, dot,

16
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:51,080
<1-11,Steph>虱子不再烦扰你[美国儿歌]
<1-11,Steph>now you have a cootie shot!

17
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:54,010
<1-11,Steph>我去睡觉了
<1-11,Steph>I'm going to bed

18
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,880
<1-12,Leonard>好的  我马上就来
<1-12,Leonard>Okay, I'll be right in.

19
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:59,110
<1-13,Sheldon>她不光是在嘲笑我  而且
<1-13,Sheldon>It's not enough that she mocks me, but that isn't even

20
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:01,350
<1-13,Sheldon>把打预防针的流程也搞错了
<1-13,Sheldon>the correct procedure for a cootie shot.

21
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:04,180
<1-14,Leonard>你知道斯蒂芬妮到这里来不是为了
<1-14,Leonard>Do you understand that Stephanie's not here

22
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,150
<1-14,Leonard>帮你治疗你那些臆想的毛病吧?
<1-14,Leonard>to treat your imaginary ailments?

23
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:11,010
<1-15,Sheldon>怎么可能是臆想 我老是听见一种高于中央C的八度音
<1-15,Sheldon>How is it imaginary that I keep hearing an octave above Middle C?

24
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,080
<1-15,Sheldon>这是臆想吗
<1-15,Sheldon>Is that imaginary?

25
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:18,380
<1-15,Sheldon>我看不是
<1-15,Sheldon>I don't think so.

26
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:21,280
<1-16,Leonard>晚安
<1-16,Leonard>Good night.

27
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:22,850
<1-17,Sheldon>莱纳德  还有件事
<1-17,Sheldon>Leonard,there's one more thing.

28
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:25,010
<1-17,Sheldon>根据我们的合租协议第一章第三段
<1-17,Sheldon>Under Article One, Section Three of our Roommate Agreement,

29
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,550
<1-17,Sheldon>我要召开一个紧急会议

30
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:27,610
<1-18,Leonard>你不是吧
<1-18,Leonard>No, you're not.

31
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,600
<1-19,Sheldon>莱纳德提议不要开会
<1-19,Sheldon>Leonard moves the meeting not occur.

32
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,410
<1-19,Sheldon>有人同意么  没有  提议不予采纳
<1-19,Sheldon>Is there a second? None heard, the motion fails.

33
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:35,350
<1-19,Sheldon>在会议的开头  我想祝贺你
<1-19,Sheldon>I'd like to begin the meeting by congratulating you

34

<1-19,Sheldon>和斯蒂芬妮医生恋情有了进展
<1-19,Sheldon>on the progress in your relationship with Dr. Stephanie.

35
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,510
<1-20,Leonard>谢谢
<1-20,Leonard>Thank you.

36
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,610
<1-21,Sheldon>那也就是说  我们必须讨论
<1-21,Sheldon>That being said, we have to discuss

37
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,410
<1-21,Sheldon>对于"同居"附加条例的执行问题
<1-21,Sheldon>the implementation of the agreed upon "cohabitation" rider

38
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,750
<1-21,Sheldon>因为你们两人现在
<1-21,Sheldon>whichas been activated now that

39
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,610
<1-21,Sheldon>已经住在一起了

40
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:49,070
<1-22,Leonard>我们没有啊
<1-22,Leonard>We're not living together.

41
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:50,770
<1-23,Sheldon>我有不同意见
<1-23,Sheldon>I beg to disagree

42
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,090
<1-23,Sheldon>某女性被认定为
<1-23,Sheldon>"A girlfriend shall be deemed

43
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:55,190
<1-23,Sheldon>跟莱纳德  前引号  同居  后引号
<1-23,Sheldon>quote living with un-quote Leonard

44
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:57,010
<1-23,Sheldon>的时间条件是  第一  连续十晚
<1-23,Sheldon>when she has stayed over for A: ten consecutive nights,

45
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,510

47
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:03,850
<1-23,Sheldon>再加上三个非周末
<1-23,Sheldon>plus three weeknights.

48
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,810
<1-24,Leonard>这太荒唐了
<1-24,Leonard>That's absurd.

49
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,210
<1-25,Sheldon>你自己都签名了  看  莱  莱  莱
<1-25,Sheldon>You initialed it. See? L.H., L.H., L.H.

50
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:16,110
<1-26,Leonard>我签名的原因是因为 我觉得这些条例永远都用不上的
<1-26,Leonard>Wait, I only initialed it because I never thought it would happen!

51
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,610
<1-26,Leonard>我还签了一条
<1-26,Leonard>I initialed another clause

52
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,380
<1-26,Leonard>上面说如果我有超能力的话  就让你做我搭档
<1-26,Leonard>naming you my sidekick in case I get superpowers.

53
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:25,050
<1-26,Leonard>是啊  没错
<1-26,Leonard>Hmm, yes, you did.

54
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:29,150
<1-27,Sheldon>我们再来温故一下需要执行哪些条例
<1-27,Sheldon>Now, to review the following provisions are hereby activated:

55
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:33,380
<1-27,Sheldon>在冰箱里  我们不能再使用 两个单人层和一个公用层了
<1-27,Sheldon>In the refrigerator, as opposed to us having two separate shelves and one communal shelf,

56
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:36,810
<1-27,Sheldon>现在我们三个人每人使用一层 然后冰箱门变作公用
<1-27,Sheldon>the three of us now get individual shelves and the door becomes communal.

57
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,810
<1-27,Sheldon>下一条  房间清扫工作 应从每周两次增加为每周三次
<1-27,Sheldon>Next, apartment vacuuming shall be increased from two to three times a week

58
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,680
<1-27,Sheldon>以解决日益增加的死皮细胞
<1-27,Sheldon>to accommodate the increased accumulation of dead skin cells.

59
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,250
<1-27,Sheldon>第三  厕所使用时间表  我了解到
<1-27,Sheldon>Third,the bathroom schedule. Now, I'm given to understand

60
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:50,150
<1-27,Sheldon>女人对厕所的用法有所不同  所以我们应该讨论一下
<1-27,Sheldon>women have different needs, so, we'll have to discuss that.

61
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,980
<1-28,Leonard>我去睡觉了
<1-28,Leonard>I'm going to bed.

62
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:56,910
<1-29,Sheldon>你至少也得把这带走吧
<1-29,Sheldon>At least take this with you.

63
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:00,910
<1-29,Sheldon>别忘了让斯蒂芬妮签名  这里  这里  这里
<1-29,Sheldon>Look, and have Stephanie initial here, here, here, here...

64
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:04,180
<1-29,Sheldon>还有  这里
<1-29,Sheldon>and... here.

65
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,980
<1-29,Sheldon>这一条规定  从现在起她不能
<1-29,Sheldon>This states that she does not now

66
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:09,250
<1-29,Sheldon>也不准计划演奏打击乐器或者铜管乐器
<1-29,Sheldon>nor does she intend to play a percussive or brass instrument.

67
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:29,150
<1-29,Sheldon>肯定是肿瘤 压迫听觉神经了
<1-29,Sheldon>Sure sounds like a tumor pressing on the auditory nerve.

68
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:56,280
<2-1,Leonard>绝对不行
<2-1,Leonard>No, absolutely not.

69
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,570
<2-2,Sheldon>这又没什么
<2-2,Sheldon>It's not a big deal.

70
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,610
<2-2,Sheldon>我们有卫生手套的
<2-2,Sheldon>We have latex gloves.

71
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,680
<2-3,Leonard>我不管你出现了什么症状
<2-3,Leonard>I don't care what the symptoms are,

72
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,810
<2-3,Leonard>我女朋友是不会帮你做前列腺检查的
<2-3,Leonard>my girlfriend is not going to give you a prostate exam.

73
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,210
<2-4,Steph>谢尔顿
<2-4,Steph>Hi, Sheldon.

74
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,110
<2-5,Sheldon>早上好  斯蒂芬妮医生
<2-5,Sheldon>Good morning, Dr. Stephanie.

75
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:14,150
<2-5,Sheldon>我想莱纳德昨晚肯定让你性福了吧
<2-5,Sheldon>I trust Leonard satisfied you sexually last night.

76
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,650
<2-6,Leonard>谢尔顿  这种问题不能随便问的
<2-6,Leonard>Sheldon, we don't ask questions like that.

77
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:19,750
<2-7,Sheldon>那我怎么总听到你在问啊
<2-7,Sheldon>I heard you ask it over and over.

78
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,850
<2-7,Sheldon>我只问一次怎么就错了
<2-7,Sheldon>How is it inappropriate for me to ask it once?

79
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,680
<2-8,Steph>他非常棒
<2-8,Steph>He did very nicely.

80
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,450
<2-9,Sheldon>看见没  她不生气
<2-9,Sheldon>See? She's not offended.

81
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,380
<2-9,Sheldon>而且你也得到结果了
<2-9,Sheldon>And now you finally have an answer.

82
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,910
<2-10,Penny (entering)>没咖啡了  需要咖啡
<2-10,Penny (entering)>Out of coffee. Need coffee.

83
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,880
<2-11,Steph>你好
<2-11,Steph>Oh, hello.

84
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:37,380
<2-12,Penny>斯蒂芬妮  是吗
<2-12,Penny>Hi! Stephanie, right?

85

<2-14,Penny>佩妮  我就住对门
<2-14,Penny>Penny, I live across the hall.

87
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:44,110
<2-14,Penny>我听说了你很多事情
<2-14,Penny>I've heard a lot about you.

88
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:46,250
<2-16,Penny>是吗
<2-16,Penny>Really? Mm-hmm.

89
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:48,580
<2-17,Steph>怎么没人跟我提起你啊
<2-17,Steph>I haven't heard a thing about you.

90
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:57,010
<2-17,Steph>莱纳德
<2-17,Steph>Leonard?

91
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:59,250
<2-17,Steph>为什么你从来都没跟我说起过
<2-17,Steph>Why haven't I heard a thing

92
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:01,410
<2-17,Steph>这个住在你对门的
<2-17,Steph>about this woman who lives across the hall

93
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:05,880
<2-17,Steph>喜欢早上跑这儿来的女人  还穿着内衣
<2-17,Steph>and comes into your apartment in the morning...in her underwear?

94
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:15,110
<2-18,Leonard>她听说过你是因为
<2-18,Leonard>She's heard about you because we're, you know,

95
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:19,410
<2-18,Leonard>你是我女朋友  而你没听说过她则是因为
<2-18,Leonard>involved and you haven't heard about her because...

96
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,110
<2-18,Leonard>我从没跟她上过床  我发誓
<2-18,Leonard>I never slept with her, I swear!

97
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:26,280
<2-19,Sheldon>不过话说回来  这倒并不是因为莱纳德不想
<2-19,Sheldon>In Leonard's defense, it wasn't for lack of trying.

98
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,210
<2-20,Leonard>谢谢你  谢尔顿
<2-20,Leonard>Thank you, Sheldon.

99
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,550
<2-21,Sheldon>别客气  莱纳德
<2-21,Sheldon>You're welcome, Leonard.

100
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,950
<2-22,Leonard>我的意思是
<2-22,Leonard>Look, I'm just saying, um...

<2-22,Leonard>佩妮是我们众多邻居中的一位
<2-22,Leonard>Penny is one of our many neighbors, you know,

102
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:43,010
<2-22,Leonard>在我们这幢楼里  邻居们进进出出  很随便的  不讲究穿着
<2-22,Leonard>and in our building, neighbors come and go, it's very casual, no dress code.

103
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:47,040
<2-22,Leonard>实际上  有好几天早上  我都是穿着睡衣
<2-22,Leonard>In fact, some mornings I'll just mosey down to the third floor

104
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,700
<2-23,Sheldon>荡到三楼瓦塔比蒂安太太家里跟她一起吃麦片的
<2-23,Sheldon>in my pajamas and have cereal with Mrs. Vartabedian.

105
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,070
<2-23,Sheldon>真的吗
<2-23,Sheldon>Really?

106
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,260
<2-23,Sheldon>我怎么从来都没被瓦塔比蒂安太太
<2-23,Sheldon>I have never once been invited

107
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,250
<2-23,Sheldon>邀请去共进麦片的
<2-23,Sheldon>to have cereal with Mrs. Vartabedian.

108
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,350
<2-23,Sheldon>她看你不爽
<2-23,Sheldon>She doesn't like you.

109
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,310
<2-24,Leonard>你不是要去切除什么胆囊么
<2-24,Leonard>You have a gall bladder to remove and I have

110
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:03,410
<2-24,Leonard>我要去洗澡了  而佩妮要穿衣服了
<2-24,Leonard>to get in the shower and Penny has clothes to put on, so...

111
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:06,480
<2-25,Steph>很高兴能见到你
<2-25,Steph>Well, it was very nice meeting you.

112
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,080
<2-26,Penny>我也很高兴终于见到你了
<2-26,Penny>Nice to finally meet you, too.

<2-27,Steph>And I'll see you tonight?

114
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:10,750
<2-28,Leonard>好的  再见
<2-28,Leonard>Okay, bye-bye.

115
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:24,310
<2-30,Sheldon>我到底做了什么事情  招惹到了瓦塔比蒂安太太
<2-30,Sheldon>What could I possibly have done to offend Mrs. Vartabedian?

116

00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,430
<6-3,Steph>我是说  我从来没见过更糟糕的了
<6-3,Steph>I mean, I've never seen anything like it.

00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:04,590
<6-5,Steph>你必须马上停止说话

251
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,860
<6-12,Leonard>小心点  如果没痊愈  下次会更厉害
<6-12,Leonard>Careful, if you don't get it all, it'll only come back worse.

260
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,930
<6-20,Leonard>我有点怕怕
<6-20,Leonard>It's just a little scary.

00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,660
<6-22,Leonard>怕怕什么时候不是又惊又喜呢
<6-22,Leonard>When is scary not good?

283
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:11,290
<7-6,Penny>你和斯蒂芬妮谈的如何
<7-6,Penny>So, how did the talk with Stephanie go?

284
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:17,090
<7-7,Leonard>某种意义上讲  谈得超好
<7-7,Leonard>Well, um, on one level, really, really well.

285
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,830
<7-8,Penny>你告诉她你想慢点来啦
<7-8,Penny>So, you told her you wanted to slow things down?

286
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:21,430
<7-9,Leonard>没有讲得这么明确
<7-9,Leonard>Not specifically,

287
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:24,390
<7-9,Leonard>不过我的确告诉她了我的感受
<7-9,Leonard>but, uh, I did tell her that I had feelings.

288
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:28,360
<7-10,Penny>很好嘛  然后呢
<7-10,Penny>Good, good. And then what?

289
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:33,860
<7-11,Leonard>然后啊  主题就变了
<7-11,Leonard>And then, uh, the subject got changed somehow.

290
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:36,930
<7-12,Penny>你们上床啦  对吧
<7-12,Penny>You had sex, didn't you?

291
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:40,560
<7-13,Leonard>上了一小下
<7-13,Leonard>Um... little bit.

292
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:43,630
<7-13,Leonard>什么
<7-13,Leonard>What?

293
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:45,360
<7-14,Penny>没什么
<7-14,Penny>Nothing.

294
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:53,260
<7-14,Penny>好吧  听起来进展顺利
<7-14,Penny>Okay, well, it sounds like things are going to work out.

295
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:55,560
<7-15,Leonard>是啊  都很好
<7-15,Leonard>Yeah, it's all good.

296
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:56,760
<7-14,Penny>所有问题都会化解
<7-14,Penny>Everything's going to work out.

297
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:57,860
<7-15,Leonard>不管是怎么化解的
<7-15,Leonard>One way or another.

298
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:00,030
<7-16,Penny>拜托  莱纳德
<7-16,Penny>come on, Leonard,

299
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:03,560
<7-16,Penny>你有权利试着 让事情按照你喜欢的方式来
<7-16,Penny>You are entitled to try and make things go the way you want them to.

300
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,990
<7-17,Leonard>-真的吗  -是的
<7-17,Leonard>-Really? -Yes!

301
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:08,790
<7-18,Penny>你不一定总是要顺着女人的意思
<7-18,Penny>You don't always have to go along with what the woman wants.

302
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:12,630
<7-20,Penny>什么
<7-20,Penny>What?

303
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:16,690
<7-21,Leonard>没什么  就是在重新思考我的整个人生
<7-21,Leonard>Nothing. Just... rethinking my whole life.

304
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:23,990
<8-2,Leonard>好吧  事情是这样的
<8-2,Leonard>Okay, here's the thing.

305
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:28,630
<7-21,Leonard>我害怕如果我要她搬出去  她会甩了我
<7-21,Leonard>I'm afraid that if I ask her to move out, she'll just dump me.

306
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:30,290
<7-22,Penny>那你就得冒这个险
<7-22,Penny>Well, it's a chance you have to take.

307
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,930
<7-22,Penny>我是说  如果注定要这样  躲也躲不过
<7-22,Penny>I mean, look, if it's meant to be, it'll be.

308
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,330
<7-23,Leonard>真会安慰人
<7-23,Leonard>Very comforting.

309
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:40,630
<7-23,Leonard>好吧  我怎么和她说
<7-23,Leonard>Okay, so what do I say to her?

310
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:41,990
<7-23,Leonard>我不知道
<7-23,Leonard>I don't know.

311
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:45,430
<7-24,Penny>我的意思是别的女人想要和你慢慢来 她们是怎么说的
<7-24,Penny>I mean, what have women said to you when they wanted to slow a relationship down?

312
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:50,290
<7-25,Leonard>我真的很喜欢你 但我想看看和马克会怎样
<7-25,Leonard>I really like you, but I want to see how things go with Mark?

313
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:54,730
<7-26,Penny>是  那倒是可以让你们的关系慢下来
<7-26,Penny>Yeah, that'll slow it down.

314
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:03,560
<8-1,Steph>抱歉  我打断你了
<8-1,Steph>I'm sorry, I totally interrupted you.

315
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,590
<8-1,Steph>你刚才说什么来着
<8-1,Steph>What were you saying?

316
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:09,530
<8-2,Leonard>对  恩
<8-2,Leonard>Oh, right, yeah, um...

317
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:13,390
<8-2,Leonard>斯蒂芬妮  是这样的
<8-2,Leonard>So, Stephanie, here's the thing.

318
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,660
<8-2,Leonard>我真的很喜欢你
<8-2,Leonard>I really like you.

319
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:19,930
<8-3,Steph>噢  天哪  你要说那番话了
<8-3,Steph>Oh, God, here comes the speech.

320
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:24,060
<8-4,Leonard>什么话
<8-4,Leonard>What speech?

321
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:26,790
<8-7,Steph>我真的很喜欢你
<8-7,Steph>"I really like you,

322
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:29,560
<8-4,Leonard>但我们或许相处的时间应该再少一点
<8-4,Leonard>"but maybe we should spend a little less time together

323
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:32,630
<8-5,Steph>因为我想要有一点私人空间 但我会周二打电话给你的
<8-5,Steph>"'cause I need my space but I'll call you on Tuesday"

324
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:37,070
<8-5,Steph>接着你再也不会打电话给我了 所以只能我打给你  但你不会回我
<8-5,Steph>and then you never call me so I call you,but you don't call me back

325
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,560
<8-5,Steph>接着当我某天在咖啡馆遇见你
<8-5,Steph>and then when I run into you at the coffee shop,

326
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:40,960
<8-5,Steph>你假装你的语音信箱
<8-5,Steph>you pretend like you've been having problems

327
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:43,130
<8-5,Steph>好像坏了  但我知道你是在撒谎
<8-5,Steph>with your voice mail and I know that you're lying,

328
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:48,590
<8-5,Steph>但我假装不在乎 即使在心里我已经想死你了
<8-5,Steph>but I pretend like I don't care even though I'm dying inside!

329
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:55,530
<8-5,Steph>不是的
<8-5,Steph>No!

330
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:59,760
<8-6,Leonard>不  不是的  我不会那样说的
<8-6,Leonard>No, no! I wasn't going to say any of that.

331
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,460
<8-6,Leonard>我刚才是想说
<8-6,Leonard>I was just going to say...

332
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:04,630
<8-7,Steph>我是真的很喜欢你
<8-7,Steph>I really like you.

333
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:09,060
<8-7,Steph>噢  太好了
<8-7,Steph>Oh, good!

334
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,260
<8-7,Steph>因为我也真的很喜欢你
<8-7,Steph>'Cause I really like you, too.

335
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:17,330
<8-8,Leonard>棒极了[同义:太糟了]
<8-8,Leonard>Terrific.

336
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:24,590
<9-1,Leonard>嘿
<9-1,Leonard>Hey.

337
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,530
<9-2,Raj>-嘿  -嘿
<9-2,Raj>- Hey.- Hey.

338
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:30,230
<9-3,Howard>毛衣挺不错的嘛
<9-3,Howard>nice sweater.

339
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,030
<9-4,Leonard>恩  斯蒂芬妮给我买的  这衣服挺有趣的
<9-4,Leonard>Yeah, Stephanie got it for me. It's kind of fun.

340
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:36,930
<9-5,Raj>上面有一只大鸟诶  老兄
<9-5,Raj>It's got a big bird on it, dude.

341
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:40,690
<9-6,Leonard>是  是的  这就是它有趣的地方嘛
<9-6,Leonard>Yeah, yeah, that's the fun part.

342
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,860
<9-6,Leonard>我们还把我的卧室换了新窗帘
<9-6,Leonard>We're also getting new curtains for my bedroom,

343
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:45,260
<9-6,Leonard>还有一个新床罩  和一床羽绒被
<9-6,Leonard>and a dust ruffle, and a duvet,

344
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:47,090
<9-6,Leonard>而我甚至都不知道羽绒被是什么东西
<9-6,Leonard>and I don't even know what a duvet is,

345
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,160
<9-6,Leonard>但我敢肯定不会是我想要的
<9-6,Leonard>but I'm pretty sure if I did I wouldn't want one,

346
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:51,430
<9-6,Leonard>但我每次和她说搬出去住的事情
<9-6,Leonard>but every time I talk to her about moving out,

347
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:53,960
<9-6,Leonard>她就哭起来然后和我做爱
<9-6,Leonard>she cries and we have sex.

348
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:57,030
<9-7,Raj>你真幸运  和我在一起  通常会是另一种结果
<9-7,Raj>You're lucky. With me, it's usually the other way around.

349
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:02,330
<9-8,Howard>你知道吗  如果你不忍心当面说 为什么不发短信跟她说呢
<9-8,Howard>You know, if you can't talk to her, why don't you just text her?

350
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:04,590
<9-9,Leonard>不觉得这有点像懦夫的行为吗
<9-9,Leonard>Isn't that kind of cowardly?

351
