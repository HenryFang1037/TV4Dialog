1
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:18,300
<1-1,Penny>你发什么疯呢
<1-1,Penny>Whatcha doing?

2
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:21,150
<1-2,Sheldon>我在尝试以瞬时环形影像来审视我的成果
<1-2,Sheldon>I'm attempting to view my work as a fleeting peripheral image

3
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,060
<1-2,Sheldon>来激活我的上丘脑
<1-2,Sheldon>so as to engage the superior colliculus of my brain.

4
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:28,640
<1-3,Penny>真有趣
<1-3,Penny>Interesting.

5
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,440
<1-3,Penny>我一般喝点咖啡就行了
<1-3,Penny>I usually just have coffee.

6
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:32,760
<1-3,Penny>你彻夜未眠吗
<1-3,Penny>You've been up all night?

7
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:33,850
<1-4,Sheldon>早上了吗
<1-4,Sheldon>Is it morning?

8
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:34,570
<1-5,Penny>是的
<1-5,Penny>Yes.

9
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,250
<1-6,Sheldon>那我就是彻夜未眠了
<1-6,Sheldon>Then I've been up all night.

10
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,360
<1-7,Penny>你卡壳了
<1-7,Penny>And you're stuck?

11
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:43,710
<1-8,Sheldon>要不然怎么会有人想要激活上丘脑
<1-8,Sheldon>Why else would a person try to engage their superior colliculus?

12
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,620
<1-9,Penny>真抱歉  亲爱的  喝完咖啡前我可帮不了你
<1-9,Penny>Oh, sorry, sweetie, I can't help you till I've had my coffee.

13
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:57,770
<1-10,Leonard>佩妮  我早就告诉过你  你要不把他关到他房间里
<1-10,Leonard>Penny, I told you if you don't put him in his crate at night

14
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,740
<1-10,Leonard>他会在公寓里上蹿下跳一整夜
<1-10,Leonard>he just runs around the apartment.

15
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,310
<1-11,Penny>现在又是在干嘛
<1-11,Penny>What is he doing now?

16
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:08,330
<1-12,Leonard>他要不是在分解公式的项
<1-12,Leonard>Hmm, he's either isolating the terms

17
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,600
<1-12,Leonard>一一检验的话
<1-12,Leonard>of his formula and examining them individually,

18
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:12,860
<1-12,Leonard>就是在...
<1-12,Leonard>or...

19
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:14,830
<1-12,Leonard>寻找在被彼得潘削掉之后
<1-12,Leonard>looking for the alligator that swallowed his hand

20
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,740
<1-12,Leonard>让短吻鳄吞噬的手
<1-12,Leonard>after Peter Pan cut it off.

21
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,610
<1-13,Sheldon>虎克船长的手是被鳄鱼吃掉的
<1-13,Sheldon>Captain Hook's hand was eaten by a crocodile,

22
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:22,180
<1-13,Sheldon>不是短吻鳄
<1-13,Sheldon>not an alligator.

23
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,740
<1-13,Sheldon>你要想损我  至少把事实给弄清楚先
<1-13,Sheldon>If you're going to mock me, at least get your facts straight.

24
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:28,150
<1-14,Leonard>遵命  船长
<1-14,Leonard>Aye, aye, Captain.

25
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,620
<1-15,Sheldon>我就不明白了
<1-15,Sheldon>I can't see it!

26
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:33,280
<1-15,Sheldon>怎么就结合不起来呢
<1-15,Sheldon>It just won't coalesce.

27
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:35,000
<1-16,Leonard>也许你应该重新开始
<1-16,Leonard>Maybe you need a fresh start.

28
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,130
<1-16,Leonard>有道理
<1-16,Leonard>You're right.

29
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:51,020
<1-17,Sheldon>真是个好主意  莱纳德  谢谢
<1-17,Sheldon>It's a great idea, Leonard. Thank you.

33
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,430
<2-2,Howard>他卡壳多久了
<2-2,Howard>How long has he been stuck?

00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:42,650
<2-5,Howard>你试过将他重新启动一下吗
<2-5,Howard>Have you tried rebooting him?

39
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,910
<2-6,Leonard>才不呢  这是固件问题
<2-6,Leonard>No, I think it's a firmware problem.

40
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,880
<2-7,Raj (arriving)>哟  今晚是格兰黛尔的月光溜冰场的

<2-15,Howard>天  他真的是走火入魔了  是吗
<2-15,Howard>Boy, he's really gone, isn't he?

<2-21,Sheldon>在哥手里不是青豆  是碳原子
<2-21,Sheldon>Not lima beans, carbon atoms.

64
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:55,350
<2-22,Raj>但老子在吃掉青豆之前
<2-22,Raj>But if I don't eat my lima beans,

65
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,600
<2-22,Raj>是不能吃饼干的
<2-22,Raj>I can't have my cookie.

<2-23,Leonard>给  你要豌豆吗

67
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:00,260
<2-24,Sheldon>豌豆  太赞了
<2-24,Sheldon>The peas-- perfect.

68
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:01,930
<2-24,Sheldon>正好拿来做电子
<2-24,Sheldon>They can be electrons.

69
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,570
<2-25,Howard>要我的玉米不
<2-25,Howard>Want my corn?

70
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,480
<2-26,Sheldon>你脑残啊

<2-26,Sheldon>我拿玉米能做什么
<2-26,Sheldon>What would I do with corn?

72
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:12,270
<2-27,Leonard>那个滑旱冰  我们去之前是不是先吃饭
<2-27,Leonard>So roller skating-- should we all grab a bite to eat first?

73
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,420
<2-28,Howard>好啊  华馆怎么样
<2-28,Howard>Good. P.F. Chang's?

00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,750
<2-29,Leonard>你娘不会来吧
<2-29,Leonard>Your mom's not coming, right?

77
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,530
<2-30,Howard>我保证这次绝对不来了
<2-30,Howard>Not this time, I promise.

78
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,700
<2-31,Raj>我要把话说清楚了  滑旱冰是我的主意
<2-31,Raj>Okay, just to be clear, roller skating was my idea,

79
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:27,010
<2-31,Raj>而我对你们将其变成四人约会表示高度不满
<2-31,Raj>and I'm very unhappy that you turned it into a double date,

80
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,540
<2-31,Raj>我预祝你们都摔屁墩
<2-31,Raj>and I hope you both fall on your asses

81
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,310
<2-31,Raj>摔断尾椎骨
<2-31,Raj>and break your coccyxes.

82
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:35,530
<2-32,Sheldon>尾椎骨的英文复数是"coccyges"
<2-32,Sheldon>The plural of coccyx is coccyges.

83
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:38,780
<2-33,Raj>去你丫的  还哥青豆
<2-33,Raj>Screw you. Give me back my lima beans.

84
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,190
<3-1,Bernadette>我的天呐 你有没试过如此丢人
<3-1,Bernadette>Oh, my God. Have you ever been so embarrassed?

85
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,470
<3-2,Penny>至少最近没有
<3-2,Penny>Not recently.

86
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,820
<3-3,Bernadette>我都说不出他们哪个更烂了
<3-3,Bernadette>I don't know which was lamer:

87
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:49,310
<3-3,Bernadette>到底是寒冰技巧还是他们的迪斯科舞姿
<3-3,Bernadette>their roller-skating or their disco dancing.

88
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,460
<3-4,Penny>就我而言  最惨的是
<3-4,Penny>For me, the worst part

89
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:53,040
<3-4,Penny>人们看到了我们和他们一起离开的
<3-4,Penny>was when people saw us leave with them.

90
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,970
<3-5,Leonard>你小子有两手啊  霍华德
<3-5,Leonard>You had some nice moves out there, Howard.

91
00:04:58,410 --> 00:04:59,690
<3-6,Howard>谢谢夸奖  你也不错
<3-6,Howard>Thanks. You, too.

92
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,100
<3-7,Leonard>你注意到人们看我们的眼神了吗
<3-7,Leonard>Did you notice all the people looking at us?

93
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,770
<3-8,Howard>没怎么注意  我完全沉迷在了舞步中
<3-8,Howard>Not really. I was in my boogie zone.

94
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,920
<3-9,Bernadette>当霍华德想要劈叉的时候
<3-9,Bernadette>When Howard tried to do the splits...

95
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:11,310
<3-10,Penny>嘘
<3-10,Penny>Shh.

96
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:13,160
<3-11,Leonard>抱歉  我走得有点慢
<3-11,Leonard>Sorry. I'm moving a little slow.

97
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:14,960
<3-11,Leonard>可能是挫伤了尾骨
<3-11,Leonard>I think I bruised my coccyx.

98
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:16,640
<3-12,Penny>可怜的小宝贝
<3-12,Penny>Oh, poor baby.

99
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,400
<3-13,Leonard>别告诉库萨帕里
<3-13,Leonard>Don't tell Koothrappali.

100
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,120
<3-13,Leonard>你先请
<3-13,Leonard>After you.

101
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:21,590
<3-14,Penny>真绅士
<3-14,Penny>Oh, what a gentleman.

102
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,050
<3-14,Penny>嗨  谢尔顿
<3-14,Penny>Hey, Sheldon.

103
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:24,780
<3-15,Leonard>天啊
<3-15,Leonard>Oh, my God!

104
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,030
<3-15,Leonard>你在
<3-15,Leonard>Are you...

105
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:27,930
<3-16,Sheldon>我的神啊
<3-16,Sheldon>Good Lord!

106
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,690
<3-16,Sheldon>你们把一切都毁了
<3-16,Sheldon>You're ruining everything!

107
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,620
<3-17,Penny>该死的
<3-17,Penny>Oh, damn.

108
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,530
<3-18,Leonard>你没事吧
<3-18,Leonard>Are you okay?

109
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,890
<3-19,Penny>我看起来像没事吗
<3-19,Penny>Do I look okay?

110
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,800
<3-20,Leonard>别冲我发火啊  我也摔了
<3-20,Leonard>Don't bark at me. I fell, too.

111
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:37,270
<3-21,Penny>你都摔一晚上了  也该习惯了
<3-21,Penny>Oh, you've been falling all night. You're used to it.

112
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,750
<3-22,Howard>谢尔顿  你到底在干嘛
<3-22,Howard>Sheldon, what the hell are you doing?

113
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,510
<3-23,Sheldon>做我这三天一直在做的工作
<3-23,Sheldon>The same thing I've been doing for three days.

114
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,090
<3-23,Sheldon>想要弄明白为什么
<3-23,Sheldon>Trying to figure out why electrons

115
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,690
<3-23,Sheldon>电子在穿过石墨烯时
<3-23,Sheldon>behave as if they have no mass

116
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,670
<3-23,Sheldon>会表现得像是没有质量一样
<3-23,Sheldon>when traveling through a graphene sheet.

117
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,920
<3-24,Bernadette>用大理石来推测
<3-24,Bernadette>With marbles?

118
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:49,750
<3-25,Sheldon>我总得找点比豆子大的东西
<3-25,Sheldon>Well, I needed something bigger

<3-27,Sheldon>我不需要睡眠  我想要答案
<3-27,Sheldon>I don't need sleep. I need answers.

<3-28,Penny>Toad of truth?

128
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,090
<3-28,Penny>这是物理学上的名词吗
<3-28,Penny>Is that a physics thing?

129
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,220
<3-29,Leonard>不  那是疯狂的产物
<3-29,Leonard>No, that's a crazy thing.

00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,720
<3-30,Bernadette>好了  谢尔顿
<3-30,Bernadette>Okay, Sheldon.

131
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:19,290
<3-30,Bernadette>如果我们不能保证足够的快速眼动睡眠的话
<3-30,Bernadette>What happens to our neuroreceptors

132
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,260
<3-30,Bernadette>会对神经受体造成怎样的影响呢
<3-30,Bernadette>when we don't get enough REM sleep?

133
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,570
<3-31,Sheldon>会失去对5-羟色胺和正肾上腺素的敏感性
<3-31,Sheldon>They lose their sensitivity to serotonin and norepinephrine.

134
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,190
<3-32,Bernadette>那就会引起
<3-32,Bernadette>Which leads to...?

135
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,770
<3-33,Sheldon>认知功能受损

166
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,050
<5-6,Sheldon>体积比错得一塌糊涂
<5-6,Sheldon>Size ratio was all wrong.

167
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,210
<5-6,Sheldon>我不能把它们具象化
<5-6,Sheldon>Couldn't visualize it.

168
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,970
<5-6,Sheldon>我要找更大的碳原子
<5-6,Sheldon>Needed bigger carbon atoms.

169
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,620
<5-7,Leonard>好好好
<5-7,Leonard>Sure, sure.

170
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,790
<5-7,Leonard>你怎么进来的

<5-8,Sheldon>和单回路报警器  小孩子的玩意了
<5-8,Sheldon>single-circuit alarm. Child's play.

173
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:40,670
<5-8,Sheldon>我在建立碳原子模型的时候
<5-8,Sheldon>You can start sorting protons and neutrons

174
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,600
<5-8,Sheldon>你正好可以把质子和中子分类整理出来
<5-8,Sheldon>while I build carbon atoms.

175
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:44,100
<5-9,Leonard>我可不这么想
<5-9,Leonard>No, I don't think so.

176
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:46,070
<5-9,Leonard>我们现在该回家了

<5-12,Sheldon>试试看啊  你永远别想抓到我
<5-12,Sheldon>You can try, but you'll never catch me.

193
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,140
<6-5,Sheldon>我有好消息
<6-5,Sheldon>I have good news.

194
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,750
<6-6,Leonard>那也不用深更半夜冲进来
<6-6,Leonard>And you had to barge in here and wake us up

195
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,270
<6-6,Leonard>吓我们吧
<6-6,Leonard>in the middle of the night?

196
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,080
<6-7,Sheldon>你关了手机
<6-7,Sheldon>Your cell phone was off.

197
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:52,760
<6-8,Leonard>因为我们不想被吵到
<6-8,Leonard>Because we didn't want to be disturbed.

198
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:55,200
<6-9,Sheldon>反正也没什么用  不是吗
<6-9,Sheldon>Well, that didn't work out, did it?

199
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:58,040
<6-10,Penny>谢尔顿  你到底想干嘛
<6-10,Penny>Sheldon, what do you want?

200
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:01,360
<6-11,Sheldon>我特来宣告  本天才找到了答案
<6-11,Sheldon>I came to tell you I've got the answer.

201
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,370
<7-8,Sheldon>真的吗
<7-8,Sheldon>Really?

202
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,480
<6-12,Leonard>你解开石墨烯的难题了吗
<6-12,Leonard>You figured out the graphene problem?

203
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:07,370
<6-13,Sheldon>不  那个还绝望地卡壳中
<6-13,Sheldon>No, no, I'm still hopelessly stuck on that,

204
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,940
<6-13,Sheldon>但我找到了解决的方法
<6-13,Sheldon>but I figured out how to figure it out.

205
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:12,390
<6-14,Penny>你猜怎着  莱纳德  我曾经说过
<6-14,Penny>Okay, you know what, Leonard, I know I said

206
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,010
<6-14,Penny>我能忍受你的室友  但我错得太离谱了
<6-14,Penny>I could handle your roommate, but I was wrong.

207
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,620
<6-14,Penny>我看我们还是吹了吧
<6-14,Penny>We're going to have to break up.

208
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,350
<6-15,Leonard>你在说什么鬼
<6-15,Leonard>What are you talking about?

209
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:24,070
<6-17,Sheldon>爱因斯坦
<6-17,Sheldon>Einstein.

210
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,340
<6-18,Leonard>嗯  至少得再多说点吧
<6-18,Leonard>Yeah, I'm going to need a little more.

211
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,180
<6-19,Sheldon>艾伯特·爱因斯坦
<6-19,Sheldon>Albert Einstein.

212
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,410
<6-20,Leonard>继续继续
<6-20,Leonard>Keep going.

213
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:36,240
<6-21,Sheldon>艾伯特·爱因斯坦在专利局工作时
<6-21,Sheldon>When Albert Einstein came up with special relativity,

214
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,720
<6-21,Sheldon>他提出了狭义相对论
<6-21,Sheldon>he was working at the patent office.

215
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:41,080
<6-22,Leonard>那你也要去专利局工作咯
<6-22,Leonard>So, you're going to go work at the patent office?

216
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:42,600
<6-23,Sheldon>你傻的啊
<6-23,Sheldon>Don't be absurd.

217
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:44,010
<6-23,Sheldon>那可在华盛顿
<6-23,Sheldon>That's in Washington.

218
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,210
<6-23,Sheldon>满大街车声嘈杂的城市我可待不了
<6-23,Sheldon>You know I could never live in a city whose streets

219
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,100
<6-23,Sheldon>你又不是不知道
<6-23,Sheldon>are laid out in a wheel-and-spoke pattern.

220
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:50,080
<7-1,Employment Office Assistant>其实  我是想要找一份
<7-1,Employment Office Assistant>No. I'm going to find

221
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:51,820
<7-2,Sheldon>半斤八两的低贱工作
<7-2,Sheldon>a similarly menial job

222
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:54,960
<6-23,Sheldon>只需要动用我的基底神经节就行
<6-23,Sheldon>where my basal ganglia are occupied with a routine task,

223
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:56,590
<6-23,Sheldon>那我的前额叶就能[高级神经活动部位]
<6-23,Sheldon>freeing my prefrontal cortex

224
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,390
<6-23,Sheldon>专注于解决关键问题
<6-23,Sheldon>to work quietly in the background on my problem.

225
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,460
<6-24,Leonard>真是雄心壮志
<6-24,Leonard>Sounds like a great plan.

226
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,490
<6-25,Sheldon>这不废话么
<6-25,Sheldon>Of course it is.

227
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,560
<6-25,Sheldon>就算和你讲话
<6-25,Sheldon>Even talking to you is

228
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:04,920
<6-25,Sheldon>也够低贱的咧
<6-25,Sheldon>sufficiently menial that I can feel

229
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:07,290
<6-25,Sheldon>让我不禁感觉思如泉涌啊
<6-25,Sheldon>the proverbial juices starting to flow.

230
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:10,380
<6-26,Leonard>得  多谢分享
<6-26,Leonard>Okay, well, thanks for sharing with us.

231
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:12,450
<6-26,Leonard>-晚安  -不客气
<6-26,Leonard>- Good night.  - You're welcome.

232
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,210
<6-27,Sheldon>你们也安安
<6-27,Sheldon>And good night to you, too.

233
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:17,840
<6-27,Sheldon>顺便  我刚观察了下你的睡相
<6-27,Sheldon>Oh, by the way, I was watching you sleep for a moment,

234
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:19,380
<6-27,Sheldon>我注意到当你仰面睡觉时
<6-27,Sheldon>and I noticed that your snoring

235
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,580
<6-27,Sheldon>呼噜打得更响
<6-27,Sheldon>seems to be worse when you're on your back.

236
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:23,480
<6-28,Penny>莱纳德可从不打呼

<7-4,Sheldon>under the lash of their betters,

250
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:02,850

<7-4,Sheldon>until finally, they dropped down

251
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:06,680
<7-4,Sheldon>化作艰难跋涉之路上的一粒尘埃
<7-4,Sheldon>and became one with the dust through which they trudged.

252

<7-4,Sheldon>有这一类的工作吗
<7-4,Sheldon>Do you have anything like that?

00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,170
<7-9,Assistant>不用打也知道
<7-9,Assistant>I didn't really have to.

258
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:29,900
<7-9,Assistant>建筑类的如何
<7-9,Assistant>So, how about construction?

259
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,960
<7-10,Sheldon>太棒了
<7-10,Sheldon>Oh, that would be good!

260

<7-10,Sheldon>拉拉锯子  敲敲榔头
<7-10,Sheldon>Sawing, hammering, eating out of a lunch pail

<7-21,Assistant>库珀先生  我就问你一个问题
<7-21,Assistant>Mr. Cooper, let me just ask you a question.

274
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,270
<7-21,Assistant>你上份工作是啥
<7-21,Assistant>What was your last job?

275
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,810
<7-22,Sheldon>加州理工学院的高级理论粒子物理学家
<7-22,Sheldon>Senior theoretical particle physicist at CalTech,

<7-22,Sheldon>focusing on M theory, or, in layman's terms, string theory.

277
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,830
<7-23,Assistant>懂了
<7-23,Assistant>I see.

278
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:23,180
<7-23,Assistant>等我一下
<7-23,Assistant>Just give me a second.

<8-1,Penny>好的  我先把饮料送上来
<8-1,Penny>Okay, I'll get those drinks started for you.

281
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,410
<8-2,Sheldon (appearing in an apron and carrying a tray)>小心身后
<8-2,Sheldon (appearing in an apron and carrying a tray)>Behind you.

282
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:43,450
<8-3,Penny>谢尔顿  你这是在干嘛
<8-3,Penny>Sheldon, what the hell are you doing?

283
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:46,520
<8-4,Sheldon>我正要去清理桌子 差点撞上你
<8-4,Sheldon>I'm trying to get these tables cleared. We're slammed.

284
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,680
<8-5,Penny>等等  等等
<8-5,Penny>No, wait, wait, no, wait.

285
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:50,550
<8-5,Penny>你在这干嘛呢
<8-5,Penny>Wh-What are you doing here?

286
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,200
<8-6,Sheldon>这问题还算合理
<8-6,Sheldon>A reasonable question.

287
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:53,640
<8-6,Sheldon>我问我自己
<8-6,Sheldon>I asked myself,

288
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:57,040
<8-6,Sheldon>我能想到最讨厌最沉闷的工作是什么
<8-6,Sheldon>what is the most mind-numbing, pedeststrian job conceivable,

289
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:58,440
<8-6,Sheldon>有三个答案浮现在脑中
<8-6,Sheldon>and three answers came to mind:

290
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:01,760
<8-6,Sheldon>收费站工作人员  在苹果专卖店工作的天才
<8-6,Sheldon>uh, toll booth attendant, Apple Store genius...

291
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:05,050
<8-6,Sheldon>还有佩妮的工作
<8-6,Sheldon>...and what Penny does.

292
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,370
<8-6,Sheldon>现在
<8-6,Sheldon>Now...

293
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,630
<8-6,Sheldon>既然我不喜欢碰别人手里的硬币
<8-6,Sheldon>since I don't like  touching other people's coins,

294
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:13,980
<8-6,Sheldon>也不想帮着抹黑"天才"这个词
<8-6,Sheldon>and I refuse to contribute to the devaluation of the word "Genius,"

295
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:16,120
<8-6,Sheldon>所以我来了
<8-6,Sheldon>here I am.

296
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,860
<8-7,Penny>你就这么走进来  就被录用了 就这么简单
<8-7,Penny>You just, you just walked in and they hired you, just like that?

297
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:21,200
<8-8,Sheldon>当然不是
<8-8,Sheldon>Oh, heavens, no.

298
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:24,360
<8-8,Sheldon>既然我不领薪水  也就不需被录用
<8-8,Sheldon>Since I don't need to be paid, I didn't need to be hired.

299
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:27,820
<8-8,Sheldon>我就直接走进来  拿起个托盘 然后开始"为人民服务"
<8-8,Sheldon>I simply came in, picked up a tray, and started "Working for the man."

300
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,110
<8-8,Sheldon>请允许我把这个盘子收走
<8-8,Sheldon>Let me get that plate out of your way.

301
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:34,200
<8-9,Penny>-谢尔顿  这太荒谬了  -是吗
<8-9,Penny>- Sheldon,this is ridiculous. - Is it?

302
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:36,070
<8-10,Sheldon>就在刚刚  在刮掉盘子里凝结的玉米脆饼时
<8-10,Sheldon>Just a moment ago, I had a minor epiphany

303
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,220
<8-10,Sheldon>我突然间就顿悟了
<8-10,Sheldon>regarding the polymer degradation phenomenon

304
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:41,170
<8-10,Sheldon>聚合物降解现象
<8-10,Sheldon>while scraping congealed nachos off a plate.

305
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,820
<8-10,Sheldon>伯纳黛特  10号桌买单
<8-10,Sheldon>Bernadette, table 10 wants their check.

306
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:44,720
<8-11,Bernadette>谢谢  谢尔顿
<8-11,Bernadette>Thanks, Sheldon.

307
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:46,730
<8-12,Penny>谢尔顿  等等  再说这也不是我的工作
<8-12,Penny>Sheldon,wait, this isn't even what I do.

308
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,850
<8-12,Penny>我是服务生  不是勤杂工
<8-12,Penny>I'm a waitress, not a busboy.

309
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,380
<8-13,Sheldon>你说得对  你的工作更低贱
<8-13,Sheldon>You're right. That is more menial.

310
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:55,100
<8-13,Sheldon>两位好  我是谢尔顿  负责这桌的服务生
<8-13,Sheldon>Hello, I'm Sheldon. I'll be your server today.

311
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:58,060
<8-13,Sheldon>不推荐点三文鱼
<8-13,Sheldon>I don't recommend the salmon.

312
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:59,840
<8-13,Sheldon>我看到它们在厨房的样子
<8-13,Sheldon>I saw it in the kitchen.

<9-1,Sheldon>It's a little unconventional, but I think you'll like it.

320

<9-1,Sheldon>味道很赞
<9-1,Sheldon>It's zingy.
