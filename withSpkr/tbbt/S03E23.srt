1
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:05,710
<1-1,Leonard>搞定  激光接上电源了
<1-1,Leonard>Ok, we've got the power to the laser.

2
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:08,550
<1-2,Sheldon>我应该带把伞来的
<1-2,Sheldon>I should've brought an umbrella.

3
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:10,640
<1-3,Leonard>作甚啊  又不会下雨
<1-3,Leonard>What for? It's not gonna rain.

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:11,630
<1-4,Sheldon>我知道
<1-4,Sheldon>I know that.

5
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:15,910
<1-4,Sheldon>但我如此白嫩的肌肤还是有可能被月光灼伤的
<1-4,Sheldon>But with skin as fair as mine, moon burn is real possibility.

6
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,440
<1-5,Howard>这是个"逗你玩儿"  对吧
<1-5,Howard>That's a "Bazinga," Right?

7
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:21,110
<1-6,Sheldon>我的巅峰之作  你觉得呢
<1-6,Sheldon>One of my best, don't you think?

8
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:26,580
<1-7,Leonard>霍华德  你要不要再检查一下 激光上的赤道仪装置
<1-7,Leonard>Howard, do you want to double-check the equatorial mount on the laser?

9
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:28,520
<1-7,Leonard>我们得把它锁定到"宁静之海"上  [月面某部名称]
<1-7,Leonard>We need it locked onto the Sea of Tranquility.

10
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,920
<1-8,Howard>没问题
<1-8,Howard>You got it.

11
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,020
<1-8,Howard>天  拉杰  别这样
<1-8,Howard>Oh, Raj, no.

12
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:35,060
<1-8,Howard>人们花了无数美元发明了英特网
<1-8,Howard>Billions of dollars have gone into inventing the Internet

13
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:37,030
<1-8,Howard>并在上面发了无数艳照
<1-8,Howard>and filling it with pictures of naked women,

14
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:39,760
<1-8,Howard>就是为了让我们不需要通过窗户来偷窥啊
<1-8,Howard>so we don't have to peep through windows.

15
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,100
<1-9,Raj>我才没有呢
<1-9,Raj>It's not like that.

16
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,200
<1-9,Raj>我只不过在看别人的电视而已
<1-9,Raj>I'm watching someone's TV.

17
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,770
<1-9,Raj>正在播《傲骨贤妻》呢
<1-9,Raj>The Good Wife is on.

18
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,210
<1-9,Raj>告诉你  这就是我的新《实习医生格蕾》
<1-9,Raj>I tell you, this is my new Grey's Anatomy.

19
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:50,810
<1-10,Sheldon>莱纳德  莱纳德
<1-10,Sheldon>Leonard, Leonard.

20
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:51,940
<1-10,Sheldon>那是啥  那是啥
<1-10,Sheldon>What is that? What is that?

21
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,210
<1-11,Leonard>别紧张  不就是只脏袜子嘛
<1-11,Leonard>Relax, it's just a dirty sock.

22
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,410
<1-12,Sheldon>你怎么可以如此淡定的把
<1-12,Sheldon>How on earth can you say

23
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,050
<1-12,Sheldon>"脏袜子"和"别紧张"放在同一句话里
<1-12,Sheldon>"Dirty sock" And "Relax" In the same sentence?

24
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:04,490
<1-13,Leonard>谢尔顿  这个世界上到处都有被遗弃的脏袜子
<1-13,Leonard>Sheldon, the world is filled with dirty discarded socks.

25
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:06,690
<1-14,Sheldon>我的世界可没有
<1-14,Sheldon>Not my world.

26
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,560
<1-15,Leonard>嘿  你们知道谁会非常想看这个实验吗  佩妮
<1-15,Leonard>Hey, you know who'd really dig seeing this experiment? Penny.

27
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:15,100
<1-16,Sheldon>我怎么不知道她喜欢月面搜索呢
<1-16,Sheldon>I wasn't aware that lunar ranging was her thing.

28
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,070
<1-16,Sheldon>尽管我可以确定尼尔·阿姆斯特朗留在月球上的
<1-16,Sheldon>Although, I suppose the retro-reflector left on the moon

29
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:21,770
<1-16,Sheldon>回复反射器的确符合了亮晶晶的标准
<1-16,Sheldon>by Neil Armstrong does qualify as a shiny object.

30
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,310
<1-17,Raj>那你怎么不叫她上来
<1-17,Raj>Why don't you ask her to come up?

31
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:26,580
<1-18,Leonard>不知道  自从那之后就有点怪怪的
<1-18,Leonard>I don't know, it's still a little weird since, you know...

32
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,730
<1-19,Howard>-她甩了你吗  -她没有甩了我
<1-19,Howard>- She dumped you?  - She didn't dump me.

33
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:31,220
<1-20,Leonard>我们只不过在这段关系中处在不同方位罢了
<1-20,Leonard>We were just in different places in the relationship.

34
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:32,950
<1-21,Sheldon>我不明白为什么一段情缘
<1-21,Sheldon>I fail to see how a relationship

35
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:36,390
<1-21,Sheldon>还能有地理位置的特性
<1-21,Sheldon>can have the qualities of a geographic location.

36
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:37,320
<1-22,Howard>唔  这很简单
<1-22,Howard>Oh, it's very simple.

37
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,520
<1-22,Howard>莱纳德住在一个叫做"请别离开"的小镇里
<1-22,Howard>Leonard was living in a little town called "Please don't leave me"

38
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:44,660
<1-22,Howard>而佩妮则刚搬到了一个叫"拜拜"的小岛上
<1-22,Howard>while Penny had just moved to the island of "Buh-bye."

39
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:48,300
<1-23,Leonard>去你丫的
<1-23,Leonard>Screw you guys.

40
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,800
<1-23,Leonard>我去看看她在不在家
<1-23,Leonard>I'm gonna go see if she's home.

41
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,890
<1-24,Howard>如果方便的话
<1-24,Howard>If it's not too much trouble,

42
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,130
<1-24,Howard>我想把望远镜瞄准月球了
<1-24,Howard>I'd like to point this at the moon now.

43
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:54,910
<1-25,Raj>且慢
<1-25,Raj>Wait a second.

44
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:56,370
<1-25,Raj>好老婆正哭呢
<1-25,Raj>The good wife is crying.

45
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:59,140
<1-25,Raj>出大问题了
<1-25,Raj>Something's very wrong.

46
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:20,210
<1-25,Raj>生活大爆炸
<1-25,Raj>第三季第二十三集 [本季完]

47
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,560
<2-1,Penny>嘿  怎么了
<2-1,Penny>Oh, hi. What's going on?

48
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,990
<2-2,Leonard>我们在屋顶上尝试从月球将激光射回来呢
<2-2,Leonard>We're up on the roof bouncing laser beams off the moon.

49
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,470
<2-3,Penny>抱歉  什么
<2-3,Penny>I'm sorry, what?

50
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:36,510
<2-4,Leonard>很酷的哦
<2-4,Leonard>It's pretty cool.

51
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,520
<2-4,Leonard>我们准备了直径两米的反射器和其他仪器
<2-4,Leonard>We've got a two-meter parabolic reflector and everything.

52
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,040
<2-4,Leonard>我觉得你可能会想来看看
<2-4,Leonard>I thought you might want to see it.

53
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,140
<2-5,Man in Penny’s Apartment>这完全说不通啊
<2-5,Man in Penny’s Apartment>That makes no sense.

54
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,610
<2-6,Penny>你怎么可能从月球上弹射东西
<2-6,Penny>How can you bounce stuff off the moon?

55
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,210
<2-7,Man>那儿可没有重力
<2-7,Man>There's no gravity.

56
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:48,590
<2-8,Penny>呃  莱纳德
<2-8,Penny>Uh, Leonard,

57
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,950
<2-8,Penny>-这是扎克  扎克  这是莱纳德  -嘿
<2-8,Penny>- This is Zack. Zack, Leonard.  - Hey.

58
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,160
<2-10,Leonard>抱歉  我不知道你们正忙呢  或许下次吧
<2-10,Leonard>Oh, sorry, I didn't know you were busy. Maybe another time.

59
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,160
<2-11,Penny>嗯  或许吧
<2-11,Penny>Yeah, maybe.

60
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,760
<2-12,Zack>嗨  我想看看这个激光
<2-12,Zack>Hey, I want to see this laser thing.

61
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,490
<2-13,Penny>但那个派对怎么办
<2-13,Penny>Oh, but what about the party?

62
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,960
<2-14,Zack>只不过是个惊喜派对而已  什么时候到完全没所谓
<2-14,Zack>It's a surprise party-- doesn't matter when we get there.

63
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,350
<2-15,Penny>那倒是
<2-15,Penny>Right.

64
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,400
<2-16,Leonard>那好吧  上来吧
<2-16,Leonard>Okay, well, yeah, come on up.

65
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,960
<2-16,Leonard>你们是如何认识的呢
<2-16,Leonard>So, how'd you guys meet?

66
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,070
<2-17,Zack>我的公司为芝士工厂设计菜单
<2-17,Zack>My company designs the menus for the Cheesecake Factory.

67
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,330
<2-18,Leonard>你的公司
<2-18,Leonard>Your company?

68
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:20,120
<2-19,Zack>事实上是我爸的  但我和我妹妹是副总
<2-19,Zack>Well, my dad. But me and my sister are VPs.

69
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:23,370
<2-20,Leonard>呃  菜单啊
<2-20,Leonard>So... menus.

70
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:27,310
<2-21,Zack>听起来貌似简单  但在设计当中 是包含了不少科学知识的
<2-21,Zack>I know it sounds easy, but there's a lot of science that goes into designing them.

71
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,120
<3-1,Howard>开心了吧 我把脏袜子丢开了
<3-1,Howard>Happy now? I'm moving the dirty sock.

72
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,020
<3-1,Howard>谢谢
<3-1,Howard>Thank you.

73
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,990
<3-2,Sheldon>拉杰  时刻注意另外一只
<3-2,Sheldon>Raj, keep an eye out for the other one.

74
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:45,690
<3-3,Penny>各位  这是我朋友扎克
<3-3,Penny>Hey, guys, this is my friend Zack.

75
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,700
<3-5,Sheldon>-你好扎克  -哇哦
<3-5,Sheldon>- Hello. Zack.  - Whoa!

76
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,830
<3-6,Zack>这就是那激光吗
<3-6,Zack>Is that the laser?

77
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:50,700
<3-6,Zack>太他妈帅了
<3-6,Zack>It's bitchin'.

78
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,200
<3-6,Zack>没错
<3-6,Zack>Yes.

79
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,540
<3-7,Sheldon>1917年  当爱因斯坦在他的文章
<3-7,Sheldon>In 1917, when Albert Einstein established

80
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:58,170
<3-7,Sheldon>《关于辐射的量子理论中》阐述了
<3-7,Sheldon>the theoretic foundation for the laser in his paper

81
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:01,210
<3-7,Sheldon>激光的理论基础时  他最诚挚的希望
<3-7,Sheldon>"Zur Quantentheorie der Strahlung," His fondest hope

82
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:04,550
<3-7,Sheldon>就是最终的仪器要很他妈的帅
<3-7,Sheldon>was that the resultant device be bitchin'.

83
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:07,580
<3-8,Zack>唔  那任务达成了
<3-8,Zack>Well, mission accomplished.

84
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,850
<3-9,Leonard>让我来解释一下我们在做什么
<3-9,Leonard>Let me explain what we're doing here.

85
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:14,850
<3-9,Leonard>1969年  阿波罗11号上的宇航员
<3-9,Leonard>Um, in 1969, the astronauts on Apollo 11

86
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:18,160
<3-9,Leonard>在月面安置了数个反射器 而我们则要发射激光
<3-9,Leonard>positioned reflectors on the surface of the moon, and we're going to shoot a laser off

87
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,560
<3-9,Leonard>到其中的一个上面并反射回来 到这个光电倍增器上
<3-9,Leonard>one of them and let the light bounce back into this photomultiplier.

88
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:23,400
<3-10,Penny>哇  那很酷啊
<3-10,Penny>Oh! That's very cool.

89
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,600
<3-11,Zack>只有一个问题
<3-11,Zack>One question.

90
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,200
<3-11,Zack>你怎么确定它不会爆炸
<3-11,Zack>How can you be sure it won't blow up?

91
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:28,940
<3-12,Leonard>激光吗
<3-12,Leonard>The laser?

92
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,370
<3-13,Zack>月球
<3-13,Zack>The moon.

93
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,540
<3-14,Sheldon>看  这才是配得上佩妮的男人
<3-14,Sheldon>See, now this is a man for Penny.

94
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,180
<3-15,Leonard>问得好  扎克
<3-15,Leonard>That's a great question, Zack.

95
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,080
<3-16,Sheldon>才不是呢
<3-16,Sheldon>No, it's not.

96
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,120
<3-16,Sheldon>谢尔顿
<3-16,Sheldon>Sheldon!

97
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,490
<3-17,Penny>要友好
<3-17,Penny>Play nice.

98
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,790
<3-18,Sheldon>问得不好
<3-18,Sheldon>It's not a great question.

99
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:47,120
<3-18,Sheldon>怎么能有人觉得 我们会炸掉月球
<3-18,Sheldon>How could somebody possibly think we're going to blow up the moon?

100
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:51,330
<3-18,Sheldon>这才叫问得好
<3-18,Sheldon>That's a great question.

101
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,330
<3-19,Leonard>不用担心月球
<3-19,Leonard>Don't worry about the moon.

102
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:55,770
<3-19,Leonard>我们把激光调弱了
<3-19,Leonard>We-We set our laser to stun.

103
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,330
<3-20,Zack>聪明
<3-20,Zack>Smart.

104
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,940
<3-21,Leonard>发射时我们能看到光束
<3-21,Leonard>Now, we'll be able to see the beam when it leaves,

105
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,770
<3-21,Leonard>但返回时的光束减弱
<3-21,Leonard>but it won't be strong enough when it comes back

106
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:03,010
<3-21,Leonard>裸眼看不到
<3-21,Leonard>to be seen by the naked eye.

107
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,070
<3-22,Zack>裸
<3-22,Zack>Naked.

108
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,710
<3-23,Leonard>是很搞笑
<3-23,Leonard>Right. Uh... funny.

109
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:15,900
<3-23,Leonard>那个装置能测量返回的光子
<3-23,Leonard>Uh, that device, there, will measure the photons that return

110
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:16,850
<3-23,Leonard>我们能在电脑上看到
<3-23,Leonard>and let us see it on this computer.

111
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,410
<3-23,Leonard>拉杰  给他们眼镜
<3-23,Leonard>Raj, get them some glasses.

112
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,930
<3-24,Zack>酷  还有三维效果
<3-24,Zack>Cool, it's gonna be in 3-D?

113
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:30,130
<3-25,Howard>准备向月球发射激光
<3-25,Howard>Preparing to fire laser at the moon.

114
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:31,670
<3-26,Sheldon>开始吧
<3-26,Sheldon>Make it so.

115
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:37,640
<3-27,Howard>有了  看到峰值了
<3-27,Howard>There it is. There's the spike!

116
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,100
<3-28,Leonard>返回时间2.5秒
<3-28,Leonard>2.5 seconds for the light to return.

117
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,870
<3-28,Leonard>是月球  我们击中月球了
<3-28,Leonard>That's the moon! We hit the moon!

118
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,850
<3-29,Zack>这就是你们的大实验
<3-29,Zack>That's your big experiment?

119
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,420
<3-29,Zack>搞这么多就为了屏幕上的一条线
<3-29,Zack>All that for a line on the screen?

120
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:53,410
<3-30,Leonard>话虽如此 想想这代表着什么
<3-30,Leonard>Yeah, but, uh, think about what this represents.

121
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:55,490
<3-30,Leonard>我们的实验是唯一
<3-30,Leonard>The fact that we can do this is the only way

122
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:58,860
<3-30,Leonard>能证明月球上有人造物体的实验
<3-30,Leonard>of definitively proving that there are man-made objectson the moon,

123
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,790
<3-30,Leonard>这个物体是60年前刚发明飞机的
<3-30,Leonard>put there by a member of a species

124
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:04,090
<3-30,Leonard>种族中一员放上去的
<3-30,Leonard>that only 60 years before had just invented the airplane.

125
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:06,260
<3-31,Zack>那是什么种族啊
<3-31,Zack>What species is that?

126
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,230
<3-32,Sheldon>我错了
<3-32,Sheldon>I was wrong.

127
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,590
<3-32,Sheldon>佩妮能找更好的
<3-32,Sheldon>Penny can do better.

128
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:14,900
<3-33,Penny>-好了  谢谢各位  很有意思  -谢谢
<3-33,Penny>- Okay, guys, thank you, it's been fun.  - Yeah, thanks.

<3-34,Zack>-能请他们参加派对吗  -不行  只管走
<3-34,Zack>- Should we invite them to the party?  - No, just keep walking.

130
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,440
<3-36,Sheldon>他肯定交媾技能很强
<3-36,Sheldon>He must be very skilled at coitus.

<4-1,Raj>告诉你  唯一能让你
<4-1,Raj>I'm telling you, dude, the only way

<4-1,Raj>to feel better about Penny going out with other guys

133
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,850
<4-1,Raj>就是再奸再厉
<4-1,Raj>is for you to get back on the whores.

134

135
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,260
<4-3,Raj>什么
<4-3,Raj>What?

136
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,120
<4-4,Howard>那个词是"再接再厉"
<4-4,Howard>The phrase is "Get back on the horse,"

137
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:41,590
<4-4,Howard>不是"奸"
<4-4,Howard>not "Whores."

138
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:43,930
<4-5,Raj>老兄  你真恶心
<4-5,Raj>That's disgusting, dude.

<4-5,Raj>不是
<4-5,Raj>No, it's not...

140
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,190
<4-6,Howard>算了
<4-6,Howard>Never mind.

141
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,070
<4-6,Howard>不过他说得对
<4-6,Howard>He is right, though.

142

<4-8,Howard>你确定  上面说能给任何人牵红线
<4-8,Howard>You sure? They say they can find a match for anybody.

145
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:58,880
<4-9,Leonard>他们给你牵了吗
<4-9,Leonard>Have they found a match for you?

<4-10,Howard>如果算上见我就闪的  有12个呢
<4-10,Howard>And 12 if you count the ones who showed up and left.

<4-11,Sheldon>我无法搬氮气罐下来
<4-11,Sheldon>I can't bring the nitrogen tank down.

<4-13,Sheldon>-为什么  -我重申一遍
<4-13,Sheldon>- Why not?  - All right, let me restate that.

150
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:12,060
<4-13,Sheldon>它很重  我不想搬
<4-13,Sheldon>It's very heavy, and I don't want to.

151

00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:19,030
<4-15,Sheldon>用膝盖  别用背

154
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,030
<4-15,Sheldon>晚安
<4-15,Sheldon>Good night.

155

<4-16,Raj>知道什么才好玩吗
<4-16,Raj>You know what would be fun?

00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:28,370
<4-16,Raj>帮谢尔顿申请网上交友
<4-16,Raj>Signing Sheldon up for online dating.

157
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:29,370
<4-17,Howard>算了吧
<4-17,Howard>Yeah, right.

158
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,340
<4-17,Howard>不  想一想
<4-17,Howard>No, think about it.

159
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,640
<4-18,Raj>我们当实验做
<4-18,Raj>We make it an experiment.

160
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,050
<4-18,Raj>就像寂寞的科学怪人
<4-18,Raj>Like when Frankenstein's monster

161
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:35,160
<4-18,Raj>找了个老婆
<4-18,Raj>was lonely and he found a wife.

162
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:38,510
<4-19,Howard>他没有找老婆
<4-19,Howard>He didn't find a wife.

163
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:41,620
<4-19,Howard>而是用死尸器官造了个老婆
<4-19,Howard>They built him a wife out of dead body parts.

164
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,690
<4-20,Raj>那可以作为后备计划
<4-20,Raj>Okay, we'll call that plan B.

165

<5-1,Leonard>来了

167
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:00,370
<5-3,Leonard>你醉啦
<5-3,Leonard>Are you drunk?

168
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:03,940
<5-4,Penny>扎克是个绝好男友  你把他毁了
<5-4,Penny>Zack was a perfectly nice guy, and then you ruined him!

169
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,810
<5-5,Leonard>我怎么把他毁了
<5-5,Leonard>How did I ruin him?

170
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:10,310
<5-6,Penny>因为以前 我绝不会觉得他蠢
<5-6,Penny>'Cause in the olden days, i never would've known he was so stupid.

171
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,960
<5-7,Leonard>拜托  他没那么蠢
<5-7,Leonard>Come on, he wasn't that stupid.

172
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,490
<5-8,Penny>不  他够蠢了 他觉得你们会炸掉月球
<5-8,Penny>Yes, he was! He thought you were gonna blow up the moon!

00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,960
<5-9,Leonard>对  他确实很蠢
<5-9,Leonard>Okay, yeah, he's stupid.

174
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,630
<5-10,Penny>他一整晚都在吹嘘
<5-10,Penny>He spent the entire night bragging

175
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:28,300
<5-10,Penny>自己怎么造出"阑胃菜"这个词
<5-10,Penny>about how he invented the word "Appe-teasers."

176
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,570
<5-11,Leonard>这不是我的错吧
<5-11,Leonard>How is that my fault?

177
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:36,580
<5-12,Penny>你毁了我容忍傻逼的能力
<5-12,Penny>You have destroyed my ability to tolerate idiots.

178

<5-12,Penny>现在跟我走
<5-12,Penny>Now, come with me.

180
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:40,580
<5-14,Penny>我们去做爱
<5-14,Penny>We're gonna have sex.

181
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,780
<5-15,Leonard>为啥  不过我没意见
<5-15,Leonard>Why? I mean, okay.

182
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,190
<5-16,Sheldon>怎么回事
<5-16,Sheldon>What's going on?

183
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:48,120
<5-17,Penny>把你的降噪耳机戴上
<5-17,Penny>Put on your noise-canceling headphones,

184
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,290
<5-17,Penny>这边会很吵的
<5-17,Penny>'cause it's gonna get loud.

185
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:55,130
<5-18,Sheldon>怎么又来了
<5-18,Sheldon>Oh! Not this again.

186
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,750
<6-1,Sheldon>这怎么可能是少果肉呢
<6-1,Sheldon>In what universe is this low-pulp?

187
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,410
<6-1,Sheldon>早啊  佩妮
<6-1,Sheldon>Good morning, Penny.

188
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,800
<6-2,Penny>你后脑勺长眼睛了吗
<6-2,Penny>What, do you have eyes in the back of your head?

189
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:21,810
<6-3,Sheldon>隔天就在学校挨揍的某人
<6-3,Sheldon>When one gets beaten up every other day in school,

190
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:24,910
<6-3,Sheldon>必然会进化出更敏锐的听觉
<6-3,Sheldon>one of necessity develops a keen sense of hearing.

191
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:28,150
<6-3,Sheldon>而且  在学校挨揍的某人
<6-3,Sheldon>Incidentally, one can get beaten up in school

192
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:31,280
<6-3,Sheldon>通常都把自己称为"某人"
<6-3,Sheldon>simply by referring to oneself as "One."

193
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,020
<6-3,Sheldon>我准备做英式松饼
<6-3,Sheldon>I'm making English muffins.

194
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,310
<6-3,Sheldon>你想吃吗
<6-3,Sheldon>Would you like an English muffin?

195
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,660
<6-4,Penny>-不了  我不饿  -另外
<6-4,Penny>- Oh, thanks, I'm not hungry.  - FYI,

196
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:41,590
<6-5,Sheldon>昨晚证明我的降噪耳机无效
<6-5,Sheldon>my noise-canceling headphones proved ineffective last night.

197
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,610
<6-6,Penny>不好意思
<6-6,Penny>Yeah, sorry about that.

198
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,260
<6-7,Sheldon>作为本土德州人  我得说"驾"这个词
<6-7,Sheldon>As a native Texan,I must say I've never heard the phrase "Yee-haw"

199
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,370
<6-7,Sheldon>在交媾中很少用到
<6-7,Sheldon>used in quite that context.

200
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,300
<6-8,Penny>天呐
<6-8,Penny>Oh, God.

201
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,440
<6-8,Penny>天呐
<6-8,Penny>"Oh, God."

202
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:57,740
<6-9,Sheldon>这个我倒是听过很多次
<6-9,Sheldon>That I've heard on multiple occasions.

203
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:05,250
<6-9,Sheldon>这算哪门子"微"烤
<6-9,Sheldon>In what universe is that lightly toasted?

204
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,550
<6-9,Sheldon>今天真是我一生之中最扯淡的一天
<6-9,Sheldon>This has to be the worst day of my life.

205
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:13,890
<6-9,Sheldon>早啊  莱纳德
<6-9,Sheldon>Good morning, Leonard.

206
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,050
<6-10,Leonard>我告诉过你多少次了不要那么做
<6-10,Leonard>How many times have I asked you not to do that?

207
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:20,530
<6-11,Sheldon>算上这次吗  317次
<6-11,Sheldon>Counting this instance? 317.

208
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:23,780
<6-12,Leonard>佩妮呢
<6-12,Leonard>Where's Penny?

209
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,430
<6-13,Sheldon>她回她家去了
<6-13,Sheldon>She returned to her apartment.

210
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,170
<6-13,Sheldon>我猜应该是去洗澡加呕吐了
<6-13,Sheldon>I presume to shower and vomit.

211
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:29,220
<6-13,Sheldon>顺序不一定是按这个
<6-13,Sheldon>Not necessarily in that order.

212
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:31,740
<6-14,Leonard>她为啥都没道别一下呢
<6-14,Leonard>I wonder why she didn't say good-bye.

213
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:36,780
<6-15,Sheldon>你是在叫我解释一下人类行为吗
<6-15,Sheldon>Are you expecting me to offer an explanation of human behavior?

214
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,890
<6-16,Leonard>难为你了  我只是觉得
<6-16,Leonard>I know. I just thought as an outsider,

215
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,390
<6-16,Leonard>当局者迷  旁观者清嘛
<6-16,Leonard>you might be able to provide a fresh perspective.

216
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,800
<6-17,Sheldon>我相信你个小东西绝对不是黄油
<6-17,Sheldon>I have no difficulty believing you're not butter.

217
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,030
<7-1,Leonard>-嘿  -嗨
<7-1,Leonard>- Oh, hey. - Oh, hi.

218
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:56,000
<7-2,Penny>我得赶紧走了  早班
<7-2,Penny>Um, I gotta run. Early shift.

219
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,740
<7-3,Leonard>好啊  我和你一起下楼
<7-3,Leonard>Okay, I'll walk down with you.

220
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,190
<7-3,Leonard>昨晚挺有意思的  对吧
<7-3,Leonard>So, last night was fun, huh?

221
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:01,040
<7-4,Penny>那必须的
<7-4,Penny>Yeah, it must have been.

222
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,560
<7-4,Penny>我刚吐在我壁橱里了
<7-4,Penny>I just threw up in my closet.

223
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:05,510
<7-5,Leonard>杯具啊
<7-5,Leonard>Bummer.

224
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:08,610
<7-5,Leonard>我在想啊  咱俩今晚 去看场电影如何
<7-5,Leonard>Anyway, I was thinking tonight maybe we could catch a movie.

225
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:10,510
<7-6,Penny>今晚我不太方便
<7-6,Penny>Oh, yeah, tonight's not great for me.

226
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,980
<7-7,Leonard>不一定是今天晚上
<7-7,Leonard>Doesn't have to be tonight.

227
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:14,320
<7-7,Leonard>我差不多啥时候都有空
<7-7,Leonard>I'm free pretty much always.

228
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,190
<7-8,Penny>莱纳德  昨晚那件事是个错误
<7-8,Penny>Leonard, last night was a mistake.

229
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,530
<7-9,Leonard>你说"错误"  是塞翁失马那种吗
<7-9,Leonard>When you say "Mistake," Do you mean a fortunate mistake,

230
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:23,260
<7-9,Leonard>就比如发现青霉素
<7-9,Leonard>like the discovery of penicillin?

231
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,290
<7-9,Leonard>我很抱歉
<7-9,Leonard>Look, I'm sorry.

232
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,020
<7-10,Penny>我喝高了  很寂寞  我讨厌扎克
<7-10,Penny>I was drunk, I was lonely, I hated Zack.

233
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,830
<7-10,Penny>咱俩就当没发生过好吗
<7-10,Penny>Can we just forget it ever happened?

234
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:32,470
<7-11,Leonard>不行  整件事几乎已经刻在我脑子里了
<7-11,Leonard>No, it's pretty well imprinted on my brain.

235
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:35,280
<7-11,Leonard>特别是骑术表演那部分
<7-11,Leonard>Especially the whole rodeo thing.

00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:36,610
<7-12,Penny>老天

<7-12,Penny>就这样啊
<7-12,Penny>So, that's it?

238
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:39,510
<7-13,Leonard>提上裤子就不认人啦
<7-13,Leonard>Wham, bam, thank you, Leonard?

239
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:42,080
<7-14,Penny>我都道歉了  你就别纠结这事儿了行吗
<7-14,Penny>Look, I said I'm sorry. Can't you please let it go?

240
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,680
<7-15,Leonard>你说的倒轻松啊
<7-15,Leonard>How am I supposed to let it go?

241
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,550
<7-15,Leonard>你居然把我当泄欲对象
<7-15,Leonard>You used me for sex!

242
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,090
<7-15,Leonard>早安  冈德森太太

<7-16,Mrs Gunderson>Good morning, Leonard.

244
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:55,830
<7-16,Mrs Gunderson>或者我该说  "驾"
<7-16,Mrs Gunderson>Or should I say "Yee-haw"?

245
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:05,440
<8-1,Raj>-我靠  -怎么了
<8-1,Raj>- Holy crap. - What?

246
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,220
<8-3,Raj>我们终于证实了人类之中藏有外星人
<8-3,Raj>We finally have proof that aliens walk among us.

247
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:10,770
<8-4,Howard>你说啥
<8-4,Howard>Excuse me?

248
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,680
<8-5,Raj>这个约会网站找到了个适合谢尔顿的女人
<8-5,Raj>The dating site matched a woman with Sheldon.

249
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,150
<8-6,Howard>不可能吧
<8-6,Howard>You're kidding.

250
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,350
<8-6,Howard>一个实实在在的女人
<8-6,Howard>An actual woman?

251
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:19,650
<8-7,Raj>你看  胸部  该有的都有
<8-7,Raj>Yeah, look. Breasts and everything.

252
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:22,920
<8-8,Howard>相信我  有胸的不一定就是女人
<8-8,Howard>Trust me, breasts doesn't necessarily mean woman.

253
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,290
<8-9,Raj>-啥时候有这么一说  -我回头给你看张
<8-9,Raj>- Since when? - I'll show you a picture

00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:28,330
<8-10,Howard>我路易叔叔穿泳装的照片
<8-10,Howard>of my Uncle Louie in a bathing suit sometime.

00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:32,210
<8-10,Howard>莱纳德  快来看啊
<8-10,Howard>Leonard, you gotta see this.

256
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,910
<8-10,Howard>我们居然找到适合谢尔顿的姑娘了
<8-10,Howard>We found a match for Sheldon.

257
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:34,670
<8-11,Leonard>很好
<8-11,Leonard>Great.

258
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:37,270
<8-11,Leonard>说不定她会跟他上床  然后第二天一早
<8-11,Leonard>Maybe she can have sex with him, and then walk out on him

259
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:40,300
<8-11,Leonard>连个招呼都不打就闪人
<8-11,Leonard>the next morning without so much as a "How do you do?"

260
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,030
<8-12,Raj>你知道他说啥呢吗
<8-12,Raj>Do you know what he's talking about?

261
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,260
<8-13,Howard>不知道  你问问呗
<8-13,Howard>Nope. Why don't you ask him?

262
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,420
<8-14,Raj>莱纳德  你说啥呢
<8-14,Raj>Leonard, what are you talking about?

00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,620
<8-15,Leonard>我不想谈这个
<8-15,Leonard>I don't want to talk about it.

264
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:47,640
<8-16,Raj>瞧你出的这馊主意
<8-16,Raj>That was a lousy suggestion.

265
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,510
<8-17,Howard>随便啦  现在
<8-17,Howard>Whatever. Right now,

266
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:52,050
<8-17,Howard>谢尔顿·库珀博士要给他的真命天女
<8-17,Howard>Dr. Sheldon Cooper has to send an e-mail

267
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:53,780
<8-17,Howard>发封邮件
<8-17,Howard>to his perfect match.

268
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:57,520
<8-17,Howard>"您好  同类生物"
<8-17,Howard>"Greetings, fellow life-form..."

269
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:03,080
<9-1,Leonard>她能做到  那我也能  她能做到  那我也能
<9-1,Leonard>If she can do it, I can do it. If she can do it, I can do it.

270
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,580
<9-1,Leonard>她能做到  那我也能
<9-1,Leonard>If she can do it, I can do it.

271
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:07,630
<9-1,Leonard>我无能了
<9-1,Leonard>I can't do it.

272
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,770
<9-3,Leonard>-谁啊  -你好

<9-4,Leslie>Leonard Hofstadter. What're you doing here?

275
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:18,710
<9-5,Leonard>是啊  咱俩好久没见了
<9-5,Leonard>Uh, I know! It's been a while!

<9-6,Leslie>对啊  18个月
<9-6,Leslie>Yeah, 18 months.

277

281
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,940
<9-9,Leonard>你还记得之前咱俩上床
<9-9,Leonard>You remember when we used to have sex

282
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:34,590
<9-9,Leonard>你说这事儿没什么实际意义  只是为了娱乐
<9-9,Leonard>and you said that it didn't mean anything, it was just for fun?

283
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:35,590
<9-10,Leslie>是啊
<9-10,Leslie>Yeah.

284
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,030
<9-11,Leonard>你想再来一次吗
<9-11,Leonard>You, uh, want to do that again?

285
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,830
<9-12,Leslie>怎么了  金发美女把你甩了
<9-12,Leslie>What happened? Blondie dumped you?

286
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,730
<9-13,Leonard>不是她甩我
<9-13,Leonard>She didn't dump me.

287
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,100
<9-13,Leonard>我俩处在一段关系里的不同位置
<9-13,Leonard>We were just in different places in the relationship.

288
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:47,540
<9-14,Leslie>是嘛
<9-14,Leslie>Right.

289
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,910
<9-15,Leonard>随便了  显然呢
<9-15,Leonard>Um... anyway, apparently,

290
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,480
<9-15,Leonard>找个好久不见的人然后俩人
<9-15,Leonard>it's okay to go back to people you're no longer seeing

291
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,610
<9-15,Leonard>娱乐性地打一炮也没啥不好的吧
<9-15,Leonard>and have recreational sex with them.

292
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,280
<9-17,Leonard>你觉得如何
<9-17,Leonard>So, what do you say?

293
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:00,420
<9-18,Leslie>我考虑下哈
<9-18,Leslie>Let me think about it.

294
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:09,670
<9-19,Leonard>她不会再开门了
<9-19,Leonard>She's not coming back.

295
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:15,900
<10-1,Raj>她想见我们
<10-1,Raj>She wants to meet us.

296
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,470
<10-2,Howard>不是我们  是他
<10-2,Howard>Not us. Him.

297
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:19,870
<10-3,Raj>是啊  可是他根本不认识她
<10-3,Raj>Yes, but him doesn't even know about her.

298
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:22,940
<10-4,Howard>哎呀  他会认识她的
<10-4,Howard>Well, him about to find out about her.

299
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,210
<10-5,Raj>真的吗  我们要告诉他吗
<10-5,Raj>Really? Us gonna tell him?

300
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,800
<10-6,Sheldon>谁要告诉谁什么
<10-6,Sheldon>Who's going to tell whom about what?

301
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:28,870
<10-7,Howard>谢尔顿
<10-7,Howard>Sheldon.

302
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,980
<9-3,Leonard>嗨
<9-3,Leonard>Hey. Hi.

303
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,530
<10-9,Sheldon>你们这么惊讶让我很困惑
<10-9,Sheldon>Your surprise confuses me.

304
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:34,050
<10-9,Sheldon>我住在这儿
<10-9,Sheldon>I live here.

305
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,320
<10-9,Sheldon>是啊
<10-9,Sheldon>Right.

306
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,120
<10-10,Howard>那个啥  明天下午你什么安排
<10-10,Howard>So, listen, what are you doing tomorrow afternoon?

307
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,560
<10-11,Sheldon>说的具体点
<10-11,Sheldon>Be more specific.

308
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:42,760
<10-12,Howard>四点半
<10-12,Howard>4:30.

309
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,990
<10-13,Sheldon>那不是下午
<10-13,Sheldon>That's not afternoon.

310
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,460
<10-13,Sheldon>那是下午晚
<10-13,Sheldon>That's preevning.

311
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,460
<10-14,Howard>什么
<10-14,Howard>What?

312
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,170
<10-15,Sheldon>是我发明的描述时间方式
<10-15,Sheldon>It's a time of day I invented.

313
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:51,670
<10-15,Sheldon>更好地定义了个模棱两可的时段
<10-15,Sheldon>It better defines the ambiguous period

314
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:55,240
<10-15,Sheldon>下午和晚上之间  就是傍晚
<10-15,Sheldon>between afternoon and evening: preevning.

315
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:58,840
<10-15,Sheldon>我确信因为急需精确描述  这词定会广为流传
<10-15,Sheldon>I'm fairly certain it will catch on as it fills a desperate need.

316
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:00,310
<10-16,Raj>好吧
<10-16,Raj>Right, okay.

317
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:02,710
<10-16,Raj>那你明天傍晚准备做什么
<10-16,Raj>What are you doing tomorrow preevning?

318
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:04,250
<10-17,Sheldon>明天是周六
<10-17,Sheldon>Well, tomorrow's Saturday.

319
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,020
<10-17,Sheldon>周六晚是洗衣夜
<10-17,Sheldon>Saturday night is laundry night.

320
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:09,090
<10-17,Sheldon>所以傍晚我会用来预分选衣物
<10-17,Sheldon>So I'll be spending the preevning pre-sorting

321
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:10,620
<10-17,Sheldon>并预浸湿
<10-17,Sheldon>and pre-soaking.

322
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,320
<10-18,Howard>如果我告诉你  明天4点半
<10-18,Howard>Okay, what if I were to tell you, tomorrow, at 4:30,

323
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,130
<10-18,Howard>你将遇到
<10-18,Howard>you could meet a woman

324
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:18,900
<10-18,Howard>科学挑选出来的  你的完美伴侣呢
<10-18,Howard>who has been scientifically chosen to be your perfect mate?

325
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:22,630
<10-19,Sheldon>我会嘲讽地哼一声  无奈地摊开双手
<10-19,Sheldon>I would snort in derision and throw my arms in the air,

326
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:26,040
<10-19,Sheldon>疲于应付你们这种经常的无聊之举
<10-19,Sheldon>exhausted by your constant tomfoolery.

327
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,540
<10-20,Raj>但这是真的
<10-20,Raj>But it's true.

328
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:33,900
<10-20,Raj>我们把你所有重要信息上传到了交友网站
<10-20,Raj>But we-we put all your vital information into this dating site,

329
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,800
<10-20,Raj>学着你的方式回答了他们所有问题
<10-20,Raj>answered all their questions just like you would,

330
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:39,520
<10-20,Raj>他们找到了个跟你匹配的  她叫艾米·菲拉·福勒
<10-20,Raj>and they found a match for you. Her name is Amy Farrah Fowler.

331
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,920
<10-20,Raj>拜托
<10-20,Raj>Please.

332
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,620
<10-21,Sheldon>即使你们学得像我的回答
<10-21,Sheldon>Even assuming you could answer any question the way I would,

333
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:46,990
<10-21,Sheldon>这种红娘网站的算法  本身就是胡扯的
<10-21,Sheldon>the algorithms used by matchmaking sites are complete hokum.

334
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:49,190
<10-22,Howard>他们问到这个问题的时候  我们就是这么回答的
<10-22,Howard>And that's exactly the answer we gave to the question:

335
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,860
<10-22,Howard>你对在线交友持何态度
<10-22,Howard>"What is your attitude towards online dating?"

336
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,800
<10-23,Raj>霍华德想回答"毫无意义"  但我认为不是
<10-23,Raj>Howard wanted to write "Mumbo jumbo," But I said no.

337
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,540
<10-23,Raj>咱谢尔顿会回答"胡扯"
<10-23,Raj>Our Sheldon would say "Hokum."

338
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:02,910
<10-24,Howard>拜托  你的科学好奇心呢
<10-24,Howard>Come on, where's your scientific curiosity?

339
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:05,880
<10-25,Sheldon>大部分都用来探索宇宙的秘密了
<10-25,Sheldon>Well, most of it is being applied to unraveling the secrets of the universe

340
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:09,350
<10-25,Sheldon>剩下的则用来思考  我为何要跟你们聊这个了
<10-25,Sheldon>while the rest of it's wondering why I'm having this conversation with you.

341
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:11,310
<10-26,Raj>好吧  这么说吧
<10-26,Raj>Okay, how about this.

342
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:15,050
<10-26,Raj>即使史波克每七年也会约会一次的
<10-26,Raj>Even Spock had a date once every seven years.

343
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:16,220
<10-27,Sheldon>他那不是约会
<10-27,Sheldon>He didn't date.

344
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,490
<10-27,Sheldon>那是发情期到了
<10-27,Sheldon>It was Pon Farr.

345
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:19,890
<10-27,Sheldon>他因压抑的性欲而热血沸腾
<10-27,Sheldon>His blood boiled with mating lust.

346
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,920
<10-28,Howard>那你何不先喝上杯咖啡
<10-28,Howard>Well, why-why don't you start with a cup of coffee,

347
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:26,600
<10-28,Howard>晚点就可以跟艾米·菲拉·福勒发发情了
<10-28,Howard>and you can Pon Farr Amy Farrah Fowler later.

348
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,450
<10-29,Sheldon>我不喝咖啡的
<10-29,Sheldon>I don't drink coffee.

349
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,100
<10-30,Howard>好吧  那就喝杯热巧克力
<10-30,Howard>All right, you can have a hot chocolate.

350
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:34,080
<10-31,Sheldon>反正我不会去做这种无聊事  选什么饮料无关紧要
<10-31,Sheldon>As I will not be engaging in this nonsense,my choice of beverage is moot.

351
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:34,880
<10-31,Sheldon>但我正式说明下
<10-31,Sheldon>But for the record,

353
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:38,240
<10-31,Sheldon>我只在月份中带有R字母那月才喝热巧克力
<10-31,Sheldon>I only drink hot chocolate in months with an "R" In them.

354
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:39,880
<10-32,Howard>为什么
<10-32,Howard>Why?

355
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,050
<10-33,Sheldon>不为无益之事  何以遣有涯之生
<10-33,Sheldon>What's life without whimsy?

356
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:46,520
<10-34,Howard>好吧  我没辙了
<10-34,Howard>Okay, I'm out.

357
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:56,590
<10-35,Raj>谢尔顿  我把屋顶拿来的一只脏袜子
<10-35,Raj>Sheldon, I've hidden the dirty sock from the roof

358
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:57,790
<10-35,Raj>藏在你们公寓里了
<10-35,Raj>somewhere in your apartment.

359
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,600
<10-35,Raj>除非你愿意跟我们去见那女孩
<10-35,Raj>Unless you are willing to come with us to meet this girl,

360
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,770
<10-35,Raj>不然  它会永远藏在那
<10-35,Raj>it will remain there forever.

361
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,300
<10-36,Sheldon>你只是在吓唬我
<10-36,Sheldon>You're bluffing.

362
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,700
<10-37,Raj>你真愿意冒这个险吗
<10-37,Raj>Are you willing to risk it?

363
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:13,750
<10-38,Sheldon>诅咒你
<10-38,Sheldon>Curse you.

364
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,300
<11-1,Leonard>30英尺
<11-1,Leonard>30 feet.

365
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:47,540
<11-2,Penny>你好  莱纳德
<11-2,Penny>Oh. Hey, Leonard.

366
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,770
<11-3,Leonard>我本是个完美的小个子剩男  快乐又书呆
<11-3,Leonard>I was a perfectly happy, geeky, little lonely guy,

367
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:54,120
<11-3,Leonard>是你毁了我
<11-3,Leonard>and you ruined me!

368
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,200
<11-4,Penny>你喝醉了吗
<11-4,Penny>Are you drunk?

369
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:59,390
<11-5,Leonard>拜托  我们上床吧  反正也是没有意义的
<11-5,Leonard>Come on. We're gonna have sex, and it's not gonna mean a thing!

370
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,230
<11-6,Penny>你疯了吗
<11-6,Penny>Are you out of your mind?!

371
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:07,860
<11-7,Leonard>我真的开始认为  这是双重标准了
<11-7,Leonard>I'm really starting to think there's a double standard here.

372
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,600
<11-7,Leonard>几分钟后
<11-7,Leonard>In a few minutes,

373
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:17,640
<12-1,Sheldon>等我幸灾乐祸地冷眼旁观着本次相亲的失败
<12-1,Sheldon>when I gloat over the failure of this enterprise,

374
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:18,720
<12-1,Sheldon>你们更愿意我怎么做
<12-1,Sheldon>how would you prefer I do it?

375
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,720
<12-1,Sheldon>是标准答案  我早说过会这样
<12-1,Sheldon>The standard "I told you so"?

376
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,240
<12-1,Sheldon>还是经典的"哦也哦也"[表嘲讽]
<12-1,Sheldon>The classic "Neener-neener"?

377
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,980
<12-1,Sheldon>还是用我平常那副高傲嘲弄的表情
<12-1,Sheldon>Or just my normal look of haughty derision?

378
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,970
<12-2,Raj>现在还不能断定我们错了
<12-2,Raj>You don't know we're wrong yet.

379
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:30,780
<12-3,Sheldon>还是高傲嘲弄表情吧
<12-3,Sheldon>Haughty derision it is.

380
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,240
<12-3,Sheldon>打扰下
<12-3,Sheldon>Excuse me.

381
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,670
<12-4,Amy>我是艾米·菲拉·福勒  你是谢尔顿·库珀
<12-4,Amy>I'm Amy Farrah Fowler. You're Sheldon Cooper.

382
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,680
<12-4,Amy>你好  艾米·菲拉·福勒
<12-4,Amy>Hello, Amy Farrah Fowler.

383
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,650
<12-5,Sheldon>我很遗憾地告诉你  你上当了
<12-5,Sheldon>I'm sorry to inform you that you have been taken in

384
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:42,980
<12-5,Sheldon>被设计用来欺骗
<12-5,Sheldon>by unsupportable mathematics

385
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,950
<12-5,Sheldon>很傻很天真剩男剩女的无知算法骗了
<12-5,Sheldon>designed to prey on the gullible and the lonely.

386
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:48,990
<12-5,Sheldon>此外  我是被一只藏起来的脏袜子勒索了才来的
<12-5,Sheldon>Additionally, I'm being blackmailed with a hidden dirty sock.

387
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:52,060
<12-6,Amy>那是俚语的话  我从没听说过
<12-6,Amy>If that was slang, I'm unfamiliar with it.

388
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:56,860
<12-6,Amy>要是字面意义的话  我跟你一样讨厌脏袜子
<12-6,Amy>If it was literal, I share your aversion to soiled hosiery.

389
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:00,150
<12-6,Amy>无论如何  我来这是因为答应了我妈
<12-6,Amy>In any case, I'm here because my mother and I have agreed

390
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:02,050
<12-6,Amy>每年至少约会一次
<12-6,Amy>that I will date at least once a year.

391
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:03,970
<12-7,Sheldon>有意思
<12-7,Sheldon>Interesting.

392
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:07,310
<12-7,Sheldon>我跟我妈在关于上教堂这点上  有过同样对话
<12-7,Sheldon>My mother and I have the same agreement about church.

393
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:09,400
<12-8,Amy>我并不反对神的概念
<12-8,Amy>I don't object to the concept of a deity,

394
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:12,070
<12-8,Amy>但实在不理解  上教堂还得点名
<12-8,Amy>but I'm baffled by the notion of one that takes attendance.

395
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:16,160
<12-9,Sheldon>那你应该不会想去德州东部
<12-9,Sheldon>Well, then you might want to avoid East Texas.

396
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:17,750
<12-10,Amy>记住了
<12-10,Amy>Noted.

397
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:19,350
<12-10,Amy>相亲继续进行之前
<12-10,Amy>Now, before this goes any further,

398
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:21,790
<12-10,Amy>我先声明  所有身体接触
<12-10,Amy>you should know that all forms of physical contact

399
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:25,090
<12-10,Amy>包括但并不限于交媾  均不予讨论
<12-10,Amy>up to and including coitus are off the table.

400
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:28,860
<12-11,Sheldon>能请你喝杯饮料吗
<12-11,Sheldon>May I buy you a beverage?

401
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,870
<12-12,Amy>温水  谢谢
<12-12,Amy>Tepid water, please.

402
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:42,670
<12-13,Howard>天哪  瞧瞧我们干了什么
<12-13,Howard>Good God, what have we done?
