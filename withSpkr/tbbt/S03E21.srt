<3-2,Sheldon>So pay attention.

122
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:35,290
<3-2,Sheldon>没准儿多年以后 我的传记作者问起你这个伟大时刻
<3-2,Sheldon>Years from now, my biographer might ask you about this event.

123
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:39,130
<3-3,Leonard>我有太多话想跟你的传记作者说
<3-3,Leonard>Oh, I have so many things to tell your biographer.

124
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,570
<3-4,Elizabeth>库珀博士  谢天谢地 我完全不记得你的地址
<3-4,Elizabeth>Dr. Cooper, thank goodness. I completely forgot your address.

125
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:46,200
<3-4,Elizabeth>还好我还记得写在了手上
<3-4,Elizabeth>But then I remembered that I'd written it on my hand.

126
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,470
<3-4,Elizabeth>幸好
<3-4,Elizabeth>Lucky for me,

127
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:49,490
<3-4,Elizabeth>我没记成另外一只手
<3-4,Elizabeth>I didn't confuse it with what I'd written on my other hand,

128
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:52,710
<3-4,Elizabeth>那只写的是一颗最新发现的中子星的坐标
<3-4,Elizabeth>which are the coordinates for a newly discovered neutron star.

129
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:55,610
<3-4,Elizabeth>因为想去那儿的话  我会被超重力压碎的
<3-4,Elizabeth>'cause if I tried to go there, I'd be crushed by hypergravity.

130
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,950
<3-5,Sheldon>-不说这些了  你好啊  -你好
<3-5,Sheldon>- Anyway, hello. - Hello.

131
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,850
<3-6,Elizabeth>很高兴能见到你的本尊哦
<3-6,Elizabeth>Nice to finally meet you in person.

132
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:02,380
<3-7,Sheldon>我猜也是
<3-7,Sheldon>I would imagine it is.

133
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,720
<3-7,Sheldon>这位是我朋友兼室友  莱纳德·霍夫斯塔德博士
<3-7,Sheldon>This is my friend and roommate, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.

134
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,660
<3-7,Sheldon>你嗨
<3-7,Sheldon>Hi-lo.

135
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,290
<3-8,Leonard>我  我本来想说"你好"
<3-8,Leonard>I-I started to say "hi,"

136
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,600
<3-8,Leonard>中途又想说"嗨"
<3-8,Leonard>and then I switched to "hello" in the middle.

137
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,570
<3-8,Leonard>结果就成了"你嗨"
<3-8,Leonard>It came out "hi-lo."

138
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:21,540
<3-8,Leonard>很高兴见到你
<3-8,Leonard>Uh, it's nice to meet you.

139
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,970
<3-8,Leonard>我拜读过你的书和许多论文
<3-8,Leonard>I-I've read both your books and most of your papers.

140
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:27,780
<3-8,Leonard>我叫莱纳德  就住这儿  你太有才了
<3-8,Leonard>I-I'm Leonard, I live here, you're brilliant.

141
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:28,840
<3-9,Sheldon>真不好意思
<3-9,Sheldon>I apologize.

142
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:31,310
<3-9,Sheldon>他只是个搞实验物理的
<3-9,Sheldon>He's only an experimental physicist.

143
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,850
<3-10,Elizabeth>没关系
<3-10,Elizabeth>No need to apologize.

144
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:35,550
<3-10,Elizabeth>我有几个好朋友也是搞实验的
<3-10,Elizabeth>Some of my best friends are experimental physicists.

145
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:38,550
<3-10,Elizabeth>其实也不算好朋友  就是认识而已
<3-10,Elizabeth>Well, not my best friends, but I know them.

146
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,490
<3-10,Elizabeth>我最要好的朋友
<3-10,Elizabeth>My best friend is

147
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:42,190
<3-10,Elizabeth>是一位名叫温迪的分子化学家
<3-10,Elizabeth>a molecular chemist named Wendy.

148
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:44,190
<3-10,Elizabeth>真不好意思  我话太多了
<3-10,Elizabeth>I'm sorry, I'm rambling.

149
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,190
<3-11,Leonard>你嗨
<3-11,Leonard>Hi-lo.

150
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:47,800
<3-11,Leonard>你饿吗  渴吗
<3-11,Leonard>Are you hungry, thirsty?

151
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,000
<3-11,Leonard>我来招待你吧
<3-11,Leonard>Can I offer you anything?

152
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,170
<3-12,Sheldon>不用了  她是我的客人
<3-12,Sheldon>No, she's my guest.

153
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:51,970
<3-12,Sheldon>要招待她的话  也该由我来吧
<3-12,Sheldon>If anyone should offer her anything, it should be me.

154
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:53,900
<3-12,Sheldon>伊丽莎白  我能为你效劳吗
<3-12,Sheldon>Elizabeth, can I get you something?

155
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,440
<3-12,Sheldon>你想要女性卫生用品
<3-12,Sheldon>Perhaps a feminine hygiene product

156
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,110
<3-12,Sheldon>还是调节肠道的酸奶
<3-12,Sheldon>or a bowel-regulating yogurt?

157
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,880
<3-13,Elizabeth>这俩选项都很有意思嘛
<3-13,Elizabeth>Interesting choices.

158
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,740
<3-13,Elizabeth>考虑到我现在的需求  还是酸奶吧
<3-13,Elizabeth>Based on my current needs, I guess I'd pick the yogurt.

159
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:03,750
<3-14,Sheldon>好极了
<3-14,Sheldon>Excellent.

160
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,080
<3-14,Sheldon>要是这酸奶起作用的话
<3-14,Sheldon>If the yogurt works,

161
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,880
<3-14,Sheldon>我还买了些香薰蜡烛
<3-14,Sheldon>I bought some delightful scented candles.

162
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,690
<3-15,Leonard>这是你耶
<3-15,Leonard>Look, it's you.

163
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:20,160
<4-1,Elizabeth>非常感谢你们让我住在这里
<4-1,Elizabeth>Thank you so much for opening up your home to me.

164
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,230
<4-2,Leonard>谁愿意住宾馆啊
<4-2,Leonard>Well, who wants to stay in a hotel?

165
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:26,970
<4-2,Leonard>窗户又打不开  诡异的卡片式钥匙
<4-2,Leonard>Windows that don't open, those crazy card-shaped keys.

166
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:28,400
<4-3,Elizabeth>知音啊  我太高兴了
<4-3,Elizabeth>I'm so glad you understand.

167
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,810
<4-4,Sheldon>不对  他不是你的知音
<4-4,Sheldon>No, he doesn't understand.

168
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:31,840
<4-4,Sheldon>我才是
<4-4,Sheldon>I understand.

169
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,040
<4-5,Leonard>我也是啊
<4-5,Leonard>Well, I understand, too.

170
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,640
<4-6,Sheldon>你剽窃了我的想法
<4-6,Sheldon>You're just misappropriating my understanding.

171
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,420
<4-7,Leonard>我觉得任何一所大学都想要你
<4-7,Leonard>I think any university would want you.

172
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:43,250
<4-7,Leonard>当然  除了那些 已经接纳你的大学
<4-7,Leonard>Except, of course, any university that had already had you.

173
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:47,190
<4-7,Leonard>因为他们在接纳你之前  已经想要你了
<4-7,Leonard>Because they would've already wanted you before they, you know, got you.

174
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:51,630
<4-8,Sheldon>这就是跟你说"你嗨"的那位
<4-8,Sheldon>From the mind that brought you "hi-lo."

175
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:55,200
<4-8,Sheldon>我带你去房间看看吧
<4-8,Sheldon>Let me show you to your room.

176
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,300
<4-8,Sheldon>好啊
<4-8,Sheldon>All right.

177
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,200
<4-9,Elizabeth>我也觉得我困了  晚安  莱纳德
<4-9,Elizabeth>I guess I am tired. Good night, Leonard.

178
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,970
<4-10,Leonard>好安
<4-10,Leonard>Uh, sleep night.

179
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:01,570
<4-10,Leonard>我想说  晚安
<4-10,Leonard>I mean, obviously, good night.

180
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:02,870
<4-10,Leonard>我本来想说"好梦"
<4-10,Leonard>I started to say "sleep tight,"

181
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:04,840
<4-10,Leonard>然后我又中途改了主意
<4-10,Leonard>then I changed my mind in the middle.

182
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,080
<4-10,Leonard>我对天发誓  我很聪明的
<4-10,Leonard>I swear to god, I'm smart.

183
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:11,550
<4-11,Sheldon>说都不会话了  伙计
<4-11,Sheldon>Get it together, man.

184
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:16,790
<4-11,Sheldon>好的  给你展示一下
<4-11,Sheldon>All right, let me show you

00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:18,990
<5-1,Sheldon>这个房间里的一些功能吧
<5-1,Sheldon>some of the features of the room.

186
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:20,560
<5-1,Sheldon>首先  窗户
<5-1,Sheldon>First, windows.

187
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,560
<5-1,Sheldon>很常见
<5-1,Sheldon>Conventional.

190
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:25,930
<5-1,Sheldon>开一半
<5-1,Sheldon>Halfway open.

191
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:28,660
<5-1,Sheldon>或者说关一半  这取决于你的哲学取向
<5-1,Sheldon>Or halfway closed, depending on your philosophical bent.

192
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,970
<5-1,Sheldon>这里是我的漫画收藏 可以随意浏览
<5-1,Sheldon>Over here is my comic book collection. Feel free to browse.

00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,070
<5-1,Sheldon>这里有一盒阅读专用的一次性手套
<5-1,Sheldon>There's a box of disposable reading gloves

194
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:37,540
<5-1,Sheldon>就在床头柜上
<5-1,Sheldon>on the night stand.

195
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:39,040
<5-2,Elizabeth>很好

<5-3,Sheldon>Season 2 of Star Trek the original series on a high-density flash drive.

199
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:53,990
<5-4,Elizabeth>那要是所有的USB接口都在 灾难中坏掉了呢
<5-4,Elizabeth>What if there's a disaster that destroys all the USB ports?

200
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:56,890
<5-5,Sheldon>那就真的没法儿活了  不是吗
<5-5,Sheldon>Then there's really no reason to live, is there?

201
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:59,730
<5-6,Elizabeth>我能问个关于你室友的问题吗
<5-6,Elizabeth>Can I ask a question about your roommate?

202
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:02,460
<5-7,Sheldon>他是个蠢货  对吧
<5-7,Sheldon>He's an odd duck, isn't he?

203
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:04,630
<5-8,Elizabeth>他的情感生活是个什么状态
<5-8,Elizabeth>What's his relationship status?

<5-9,Sheldon>有过一段奸情
<5-9,Sheldon>With a waitress who lives across the hall.

206
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:12,070
<5-9,Sheldon>莫名其妙开始  又莫名其妙结束
<5-9,Sheldon>It ended as inexplicably as it began.

207
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:13,810
<5-9,Sheldon>他俩没有什么共同点
<5-9,Sheldon>They had very little in common,

208
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:15,610
<5-9,Sheldon>除了床笫之欢
<5-9,Sheldon>except for carnal activity.

209
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:16,680
<5-9,Sheldon>这就是为什么
<5-9,Sheldon>That's why I acquired

210
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,150
<5-9,Sheldon>我准备了这副隔音耳麦

<6-7,Leonard>是读过  不过有一阵子了
<6-7,Leonard>I did, but it's been a while,

236
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:23,910
<6-7,Leonard>我想在早餐时表现得聪明点
<6-7,Leonard>And I wanted to sound smart over breakfast.

237
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,910
<6-8,Elizabeth>你很聪明了
<6-8,Elizabeth>Aw, you're smart.

238

<7-13,Sheldon>坐垫我放下了  为保护你健康还消了毒
<7-13,Sheldon>The seat is down, and has been sanitized for your protection.

<7-14,Elizabeth>你真细心  不过我想先喝完咖啡
<7-14,Elizabeth>That's very thoughtful, but I think I'll finish my coffee first.

272
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:35,260
<7-15,Sheldon>看来酸奶是没起作用
<7-15,Sheldon>Ah, so the yogurt didn't work.

<7-17,Sheldon>又对检查引擎灯置之不理了
<7-17,Sheldon>Did you once again ignore your "check engine" light?

277
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,270
<7-18,Penny>不是  大明白先生
<7-18,Penny>No, Mr. Smarty-pants.

<7-37,Penny>知道吗  这不不关我的事
<7-37,Penny>You know what? It's, it's none of my business.

319
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:11,520
<7-39,Sheldon>争取与普林顿博士性交感到不安
<7-39,Sheldon>that Leonard pursue having intercourse with Dr. Plimpton,

320
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:15,090
<7-39,Sheldon>她可还有更重要的事要忙
<7-39,Sheldon>who I assure you has better things to do.

321
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:16,230
<7-40,Penny>我不是提议
<7-40,Penny>I'm not recommending it.

322
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,160
<7-40,Penny>他已经那样做了
<7-40,Penny>I'm saying it already happened.

323
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,630
<7-41,Sheldon>这太荒谬了
<7-41,Sheldon>That's preposterous.

324
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:21,630
<7-41,Sheldon>是吧  莱纳德
<7-41,Sheldon>Tell her, Leonard.

325
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:24,500
<7-42,Leonard>那个...
<7-42,Leonard>Well...

00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,440
<7-44,Leonard>拜托  不是我的错
<7-44,Leonard>Come on. It wasn't my fault.

328
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:37,020
<7-45,Sheldon>莫非你是想说你不小心绊倒 正好摔她身上了
<7-45,Sheldon>The implication being that you somehow tripped and fell into her lady parts?

329
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:39,950
<7-46,Penny>算了 我还是坐公车上班吧
<7-46,Penny>You know what? I'm just gonna take the bus to work.

00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,690
<7-48,Penny>我怕你踩到香蕉皮 然后把我搞怀孕了
<7-48,Penny>You might slip on a banana peel and get me pregnant.

333
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:50,360
<7-49,Sheldon>我必须要说  你的背叛真令我震惊
<7-49,Sheldon>I must say, i'm shocked by this betrayal.

334
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,900
<7-50,Leonard>我没有背叛佩妮
<7-50,Leonard>I didn't betray Penny.

335
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:54,330
<7-51,Sheldon>不是佩妮  是我
<7-51,Sheldon>Not Penny, me!

336
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:56,000
<7-52,Leonard>我怎么背叛到你了
<7-52,Leonard>How am I betraying you?

337
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,170

<8-3,Leonard>You still have a cold?

343
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:19,930
<8-4,Raj>或许吧  可我不在乎
<8-4,Raj>Maybe, but I don't care.

344
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:24,030
<8-4,Raj>这就是奈奎尔的妙处  里面有10%的酒
<8-4,Raj>That's the great thing about NyQuil, it's like ten-percent booze.
