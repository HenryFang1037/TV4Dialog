1
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,570
<1-1,Sheldon>2  1  6  4  2  0
<1-1,Sheldon>Two one six four two zero

2
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:07,630
<1-1,Sheldon>1  9  8  9
<1-1,Sheldon>one nine eight nine.

3
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:11,440
<1-1,Sheldon>妹子  这就是π小数点后一千位数
<1-1,Sheldon>And that, little lady, is pi to a thousand places.

4
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:13,610
<1-2,Amy>如果我问了你  那我愿意道歉
<1-2,Amy>I'd say I'm sorry I asked,

5
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:15,400
<1-2,Amy>可我连问都没问
<1-2,Amy>except I didn't.

6
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:18,810
<1-3,Sheldon>这是刊登了我跟莱纳德
<1-3,Sheldon>Oh, look, it's the Scientific American

7
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,770
<1-3,Sheldon>合写论文的科普杂志《科学美国人》
<1-3,Sheldon>that covered the paper Leonard and I wrote.

8
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:22,320
<1-4,Amy>给我看看
<1-4,Amy>Oh, let me see.

9
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,570
<1-5,Sheldon>其实当时面谈我情绪挺复杂
<1-5,Sheldon>I have mixed feelings about doing interviews.

10
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,510
<1-5,Sheldon>我享受我滔滔不绝的时刻
<1-5,Sheldon>I like the part where I talk.

11
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,610
<1-5,Sheldon>但我讨厌对方说话  我得听的时刻
<1-5,Sheldon>I do not like the part where the other man talks.

12
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:36,110
<1-6,Amy>谢尔顿  这篇文章完全没提到莱纳德
<1-6,Amy>Sheldon, this article doesn't mention Leonard at all.

13
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:37,650
<1-7,Sheldon>怎么可能
<1-7,Sheldon>Well, that can't be right.

14
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:40,580
<1-8,Amy>里面只写了"库珀博士与其团队"
<1-8,Amy>It only refers to "Dr. Cooper and his team."

15
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,170
<1-8,Amy>你中间有提过他吗
<1-8,Amy>Did you even talk about him?

16
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:44,700
<1-9,Sheldon>我就回答了几个跟我们理论有关的问题
<1-9,Sheldon>All I did was answer a few questions about the theory.

17
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,140
<1-9,Sheldon>然后表达了我对《科学美国人》杂志中
<1-9,Sheldon>And then expressed my gratitude that Scientific American

18
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,400
<1-9,Sheldon>并不会附上难闻香水卡片的感激之意
<1-9,Sheldon>doesn't include any of those smelly perfume cards.

19
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,790
<1-10,Amy>莱纳德真可怜
<1-10,Amy>Poor Leonard.

20
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,870
<1-11,Sheldon>哪里可怜了  他想出来的理论
<1-11,Sheldon>Why? The theory he came up with

21
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:57,440
<1-11,Sheldon>被《科学美国人》刊登了呢
<1-11,Sheldon>just got mentioned in Scientific American.

22
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,520
<1-11,Sheldon>他应该会爽到飞起来
<1-11,Sheldon>He ought to be thrilled.

23
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,230
<1-12,Amy>他很可能不会太爽
<1-12,Amy>He might not be.

24
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:02,010
<1-13,Sheldon>可能你说的对
<1-13,Sheldon>Oh, maybe you're right.

25
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:04,250
<1-13,Sheldon>他这人挺傻的
<1-13,Sheldon>He is kind of a lump.

26
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:05,750
<1-14,Amy>你想想嘛
<1-14,Amy>Think about it.

27
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:07,290
<1-14,Amy>如果哪天你被人一笔带过  仅被称为
<1-14,Amy>How would you feel if you were referred to

28
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,180
<1-14,Amy>"莱纳德博士团队中的一员"
<1-14,Amy>as part of Leonard's team?

29
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,280
<1-15,Sheldon>我会怒火烧尽九重天
<1-15,Sheldon>Oh, I'd be incensed.

30
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,460
<1-16,Amy>那你现在懂我想表达的意思了吗
<1-16,Amy>So you see what I'm getting at?

31
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,600
<1-17,Sheldon>"会哭的孩子有糖吃"吗
<1-17,Sheldon>Squeaky wheel gets the grease?

32
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,630
<1-18,Amy>不是
<1-18,Amy>No.

33
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:20,460
<1-19,Sheldon>"这山望着那山高"吗
<1-19,Sheldon>Grass is always greener?

34
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,320
<1-20,Amy>再想想
<1-20,Amy>Try again.

35
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,170
<1-21,Sheldon>我不知道啦  我们全都是格鲁特吗
<1-21,Sheldon>Well, I don't know-- we're all Groot?

37
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:25,100
<1-21,Sheldon>你就直说吧
<1-21,Sheldon>Just tell me.

38
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:28,230
<1-22,Amy>你们俩对这篇论文做出了同等的贡献
<1-22,Amy>Leonard is as much a part of this paper as you are,

39
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:29,820
<1-22,Amy>而他却被人忽略了
<1-22,Amy>and he was overlooked.

40
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,740
<1-22,Amy>他会不开心的
<1-22,Amy>He's going to feel bad.

41
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,510
<1-23,Sheldon>但这又不是我的错
<1-23,Sheldon>But it wasn't my fault.

42
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,050
<1-23,Sheldon>我又没故意不提他
<1-23,Sheldon>I didn't exclude him.

43
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:37,130
<1-23,Sheldon>而且这篇报导也不是我写的
<1-23,Sheldon>And I didn't write the article.

44
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,510
<1-24,Amy>还记得你在迪士尼乐园时
<1-24,Amy>Remember that time you didn't get picked to

45
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:41,490
<1-24,Amy>他们没选你而是选了另一个孩子
<1-24,Amy>pull the sword out of the stone at Disneyland

46
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:42,970
<1-24,Amy>去拔出石中剑吗
<1-24,Amy>and they let that other kid do it?

47
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:45,320
<1-25,Sheldon>那个死孩子
<1-25,Sheldon>Oh, that kid!

48
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:51,180
<1-25,Sheldon>可怜的莱纳德
<1-25,Sheldon>Poor Leonard.

49
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,200
<1-26,Amy>就是啊
<1-26,Amy>Exactly.

50
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,550
<1-27,Sheldon>不得不说  选那孩子真是个烂决定
<1-27,Sheldon>For the record, that kid was a terrible choice.

51
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,630
<1-27,Sheldon>如果你糖油条掉地上就会哭
<1-27,Sheldon>If you cry when you drop your churro,

52
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,360
<1-27,Sheldon>你绝对没那个本事去统治英国[亚瑟王]
<1-27,Sheldon>you do not have what it takes to rule England.

59
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,870
<2-1,Howard>谢谢你帮忙整理我妈的遗物
<2-1,Howard>Thanks for helping us sort through all my mom's stuff.

60
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,170
<2-1,Howard>应该的
<2-1,Howard>Of course.

61
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:33,320
<2-2,Raj>我明白那种
<2-2,Raj>I know what it's like

62
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,880
<2-2,Raj>整理亲爱的人的遗物的感觉
<2-2,Raj>having to go through a loved one's possessions.

63
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,700
<2-2,Raj>我叔叔曾是黑天神的崇拜者
<2-2,Raj>My uncle was a worshipper of Krishna.

65
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,150
<2-2,Raj>但在他死后  你猜我们发现了什么
<2-2,Raj>But after he died, you know what we found?

66
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:43,810
<2-2,Raj>一尊湿婆的雕像
<2-2,Raj>A statue of Shiva.

68
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,510
<2-2,Raj>虽然比不上咸党大战甜党
<2-2,Raj>It may not be Crips and Bloods, okay?

69
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,930
<2-2,Raj>但在印度  这也不是小事好吗
<2-2,Raj>But in India, it's a thing.

70
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:53,990
<2-3,Bernadette>你在场也挺好的
<2-3,Bernadette>Well, it'll be good that you're there.

71
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:55,260
<2-3,Bernadette>霍华德对于判断
<2-3,Bernadette>Howard's been having trouble deciding

72
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,380
<2-3,Bernadette>物件的取舍还挺费劲的
<2-3,Bernadette>what to keep and what to let go.

73
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,660
<2-4,Howard>是很难啊
<2-4,Howard>Well, it's hard.

74
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:02,070
<2-4,Howard>很多妈的东西都回忆起许多美好回忆
<2-4,Howard>A lot of Ma's stuff brings back fond memories.

75
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:03,080
<2-5,Bernadette>这就是为什么你一直
<2-5,Bernadette>Is that why you couldn't get rid of

76
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,970
<2-5,Bernadette>舍不得清掉她塞满番茄酱的抽屉吗
<2-5,Bernadette>her drawer full of ketchup packets?

77
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,280
<2-5,Bernadette>是啊
<2-5,Bernadette>Yes.

78
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,780
<2-6,Howard>那让我回忆起跟她一起出去吃饭
<2-6,Howard>It reminds me of us eating out and her saying,

79
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:13,100
<2-6,Howard>她说"快  没人在看  能拿多少包是多少"
<2-6,Howard>"Quick, nobody's looking, fill your pockets with ketchup."

80
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,520
<2-6,Howard>莱纳德
<2-6,Howard>Leonard?

81
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,830
<3-1,Sheldon>你可曾注意到过
<3-1,Sheldon>Have you ever noticed

82
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:28,580
<3-1,Sheldon>有线台账单上只有我的名字吗
<3-1,Sheldon>that only my name is on the cable bill?

83
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,290
<3-2,Leonard>有啊
<3-2,Leonard>Yeah.

84
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:33,800
<3-3,Sheldon>很好  那就好
<3-3,Sheldon>Good, good.

85
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:36,510
<3-4,Leonard>而电费单上只有你的名字
<3-4,Leonard>And your name is on the electric bill

86
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:37,470
<3-3,Sheldon>而我的不在上面
<3-3,Sheldon>and mine isn't.

87
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,180
<3-3,Sheldon>而我也不介意这事
<3-3,Sheldon>And I'm okay with that.

88
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,580
<3-4,Leonard>其实电费单上是你的名字
<3-4,Leonard>Actually, your name is on the electric bill.

89
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,360
<3-5,Sheldon>对哦
<3-5,Sheldon>Oh, right.

90
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,490
<3-5,Sheldon>真要命
<3-5,Sheldon>This is a disaster.

91
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,380
<3-6,Leonard>我同意  虽然我都不知道你在说什么
<3-6,Leonard>I don't even know what you're talking about and I agree.

92
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:55,720
<3-7,Sheldon>好吧  我要跟你说件事
<3-7,Sheldon>Okay, I have to tell you something,

93
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,560
<3-7,Sheldon>但你听了一定会不高兴
<3-7,Sheldon>but you're not going to like it.

94
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,010
<3-8,Leonard>怎么了
<3-8,Leonard>What's going on?

95
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,600
<3-9,Sheldon>《科学美国人》上
<3-9,Sheldon>An article was just published

96
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,760
<3-9,Sheldon>刊登了一篇关于我们理论的文章
<3-9,Sheldon>in Scientific American about our theory.

97
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,170
<3-10,Leonard>是恶评吗
<3-10,Leonard>Did they hate it?

98
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:08,110
<3-11,Sheldon>不  是好评
<3-11,Sheldon>No. No, they loved it.

99
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:11,060
<3-11,Sheldon>简直要把我们的理论夸上天了
<3-11,Sheldon>They, uh, couldn't say enough nice things about it.

100
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,430
<3-12,Leonard>那问题到底在哪
<3-12,Leonard>So what's the problem?

101
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,120
<3-13,Sheldon>那你知道购物杂志上只有我的名...
<3-13,Sheldon>You know how the PennySaver only has my name...

102
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,350
<3-14,Leonard>谢尔顿
<3-14,Leonard>Sheldon!

103
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,860
<3-15,Sheldon>文章里没提到你的名字
<3-15,Sheldon>They didn't mention you in the article.

104
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,370
<3-15,Sheldon>只提了我
<3-15,Sheldon>Only me.

105
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,100
<3-16,Leonard>真的吗
<3-16,Leonard>Really?

106
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,080
<3-16,Leonard>我明白
<3-16,Leonard>I know.

107
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,040
<3-17,Sheldon>这样对你很不公平
<3-17,Sheldon>It's not fair.

108
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:33,430
<3-17,Sheldon>让怒火随风而去吧  兄弟
<3-17,Sheldon>Let the anger go, buddy.

109
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:34,510
<3-17,Sheldon>你就...
<3-17,Sheldon>You just...

110
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:37,100
<3-17,Sheldon>你就放松你全身肌肉
<3-17,Sheldon>you relax all your muscles.

111
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,790
<3-17,Sheldon>除了你的耻尾肌与肛门括约肌
<3-17,Sheldon>Except for your pubococcygeus and anal sphincter.

112
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:41,990
<3-17,Sheldon>这两条肌你好好绷紧
<3-17,Sheldon>Let's keep those tight.

113
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,610
<3-18,Leonard>不需要这样
<3-18,Leonard>Uh, that-that's not necessary.

114
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:49,080
<3-19,Sheldon>当然需要  它们帮你止住尿液与粪便呢
<3-19,Sheldon>It is-- they're what hold back the urine and the feces.

115
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,520
<3-19,Sheldon>我想你还是不要看比较好
<3-19,Sheldon>Look, maybe-maybe you shouldn't read it.

116
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,680
<3-19,Sheldon>看了只会更加不开心
<3-19,Sheldon>It'll only make you feel worse.

117
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,530
<3-20,Leonard>"库珀博士与其团队"
<3-20,Leonard>"Cooper and his team"?

118
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:58,700
<3-21,Sheldon>我完全不知道他们会这么写
<3-21,Sheldon>You should know I had nothing to do with that.

119
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:02,870
<3-22,Leonard>至少这文章是关于那理论本身
<3-22,Leonard>At least they're talking about the theory.

120
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,940
<3-22,Leonard>那才是最重要的
<3-22,Leonard>I mean, that's what's important.

121
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,760
<3-22,Leonard>没错  你说得对
<3-22,Leonard>You know, you're right.

122
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,030
<3-23,Sheldon>就像当时斯坦·李和史蒂夫·迪特科
<3-23,Sheldon>Yeah. You know, it's like when Stan Lee and Steve Ditko

123
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:12,530
<3-23,Sheldon>创作了蜘蛛侠
<3-23,Sheldon>created Spider-Man.

124
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,390
<3-23,Sheldon>或许荣誉全归斯坦·李
<3-23,Sheldon>Stan Lee may get all the credit,

125
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:17,350
<3-23,Sheldon>但史蒂夫·迪特科深知他也同样重要
<3-23,Sheldon>but Steve Ditko knows he was just as important.

126
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:20,440
<3-23,Sheldon>即使斯坦·李客串了所有漫威的超级英雄电影
<3-23,Sheldon>Even though Stan Lee gets to be in all the Marvel movies.

127
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,520
<3-23,Sheldon>比史蒂夫有钱得多
<3-23,Sheldon>And-and he's far richer.

128
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,180
<3-23,Sheldon>而且他的名字家喻户晓
<3-23,Sheldon>And he's a household name, you know?

129
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,290
<3-23,Sheldon>相反  "迪特科"这个名字
<3-23,Sheldon>Whereas, you know, you say Ditko,

130
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:29,980
<3-23,Sheldon>更像是一个做"迪特"的公司
<3-23,Sheldon>and that sounds like a company that makes Dits.

131
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,470
<3-24,Leonard>这话一点帮助都没有
<3-24,Leonard>That's not helping.

132
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,600
<3-25,Sheldon>我本来想多举两个例子
<3-25,Sheldon>Well, I'd give more examples,

133
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,940
<3-25,Sheldon>但跟你一样处境的人  名字实在太难记住
<3-25,Sheldon>but, well, everyone in your position's so forgettable.

134
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:44,890
<4-1,Howard>斯图尔特  我们到了
<4-1,Howard>Stuart, we're here.

135
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:47,640
<4-2,Raj>你真好  还让他继续住在你妈妈的房子里
<4-2,Raj>It's nice of you to let him keep staying at your mom's house.

136
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,210
<4-3,Howard>是啊  我试过把他扔在前院马路边送人
<4-3,Howard>Yeah, well, I tried putting him out on the curb,

137
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:52,660
<4-3,Howard>但没人带走他
<4-3,Howard>but nobody took him.

138
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,790
<4-4,Stuart>告诉你们一下  断电了
<4-4,Stuart>Just so you know, the power's out.

139
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:57,700
<4-5,Bernadette>怎么回事
<4-5,Bernadette>What happened?

140
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,240
<4-6,Stuart>我打电话问了  据说是变压器烧了
<4-6,Stuart>I called, they said a transformer blew.

141
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,220
<4-6,Stuart>整个街区都没电了
<4-6,Stuart>It's the whole block.

142
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,940
<4-6,Stuart>应该明天就修好了
<4-6,Stuart>Should be fixed by tomorrow.

143
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,700
<4-7,Howard>等等  什么时候没电的
<4-7,Howard>Wait, when did it go out?

144
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,360
<4-8,Stuart>昨晚半夜吧
<4-8,Stuart>In the middle of the night.

145
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,160
<4-9,Howard>我的老天
<4-9,Howard>Oh, my God.

146
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,580
<4-10,Bernadette>华仔  怎么了
<4-10,Bernadette>Howie, what's wrong?

147
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,590
<4-11,Howard>全都解冻了
<4-11,Howard>It's all defrosting.

148
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:17,090
<4-12,Bernadette>没关系  只是食物而已
<4-12,Bernadette>It's okay. It's just food.

149
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:20,290
<4-12,Bernadette>不仅仅只是食物
<4-12,Bernadette>It's not just food.

150
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:23,350
<4-13,Howard>这是我妈生前做的最后的食物
<4-13,Howard>This is the last food my mother ever made.

151
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,430
<4-13,Howard>这是她最后做的牛胸肉
<4-13,Howard>This is her last brisket.

152
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:27,730
<4-13,Howard>这是她最后做的肉丸
<4-13,Howard>This is her last meatloaf.

153
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:29,010
<4-13,Howard>这是她最后做的...
<4-13,Howard>This is her last...

154
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:33,300
<4-13,Howard>我不知道这是什么  但是...
<4-13,Howard>I have no idea what this is, but...

155
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,190
<4-13,Howard>这也是最后一顿了
<4-13,Howard>it's the last one.

156
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:37,480
<4-14,Raj>一切还好吗
<4-14,Raj>Everything okay?

157
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,870
<4-14,Raj>不好
<4-14,Raj>No.

158
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:41,690
<4-15,Howard>所有我妈做的食物要坏掉了
<4-15,Howard>All Ma's food is gonna be ruined.

159
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:43,950
<4-16,Bernadette>我们何不把食物都带回家  放进家里冰箱呢
<4-16,Bernadette>Well, why don't we take it home and put it in our freezer?

160
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,660
<4-16,Bernadette>你不会想那样做的
<4-16,Bernadette>You don't want to do that.

161
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,790
<4-17,Raj>二次冷冻不仅会损失水分
<4-17,Raj>Refreezing not only removes moisture,

162
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:49,900
<4-17,Raj>还会在肉的纤维里产生冰晶
<4-17,Raj>but it creates ice crystals in the fibers of the meat

163
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,860
<4-17,Raj>那会影响肉的味道和肉质
<4-17,Raj>that can compromise its taste and texture.

164
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,570
<4-17,Raj>干嘛  我看见一个施教时刻
<4-17,Raj>What? I saw a teachable moment.

165
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:58,420
<4-17,Raj>随便教点烹饪学都不行吗
<4-17,Raj>I dropped some culinary science.

166
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,940
<4-18,Bernadette>那我们该怎么办
<4-18,Bernadette>What should we do?

167
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,320
<4-19,Howard>我来告诉你我们该怎么做
<4-19,Howard>I'll tell you exactly what we're gonna do.

168
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,310
<4-19,Howard>吃掉它
<4-19,Howard>We're gonna eat it.

169
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:08,060
<4-20,Bernadette>这里大概有18斤的食物呢
<4-20,Bernadette>There's, like, 20 pounds of food in there.

170
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,630
<4-21,Howard>你只是说我得把东西处理掉
<4-21,Howard>All you said was I had to get rid of things.

171
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:14,030
<4-21,Howard>可你没说它们不能先经过我的结肠啊
<4-21,Howard>You didn't say they couldn't pass through my colon first.

172
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:16,150
<4-22,Bernadette>华仔
<4-22,Bernadette>Howie...

173
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,490
<4-22,Bernadette>好吧
<4-22,Bernadette>Okay.

174
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,360
<4-23,Howard>那不如这样
<4-23,Howard>Then how about this?

175
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,670
<4-23,Howard>我们邀请大家来吃晚餐
<4-23,Howard>Let's invite everyone over to dinner.

176
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:27,730
<4-23,Howard>就像妈最后一次为我们做饭
<4-23,Howard>It'll be like Ma's feeding us one last time.

177
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,760
<4-24,Bernadette>我喜欢这主意
<4-24,Bernadette>I love that.

178
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,690
<4-25,Raj>我也是
<4-25,Raj>Me, too.

179
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,960
<4-25,Raj>瞧  我们有这么多番茄酱
<4-25,Raj>Oh, look, we've got enough ketchup

180
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,360
<4-25,Raj>足以覆盖每一寸肉
<4-25,Raj>to cover every ounce of it.

181
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:44,030
<5-1,Penny>谁会看《科学美国人》这种杂志啊
<5-1,Penny>I mean, who even reads Scientific American?

182
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,400
<5-2,Leonard>这本杂志名气挺大的
<5-2,Leonard>It's kind of a big deal.

183
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,380
<5-3,Penny>如果它这么有名气  那怎么请来拍封面的
<5-3,Penny>If it's such a big deal, how come the biggest celebrity

184
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:54,200
<5-3,Penny>超超大牌却是一个小小分子呢
<5-3,Penny>they could get for the cover is a molecule?

185
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,370
<5-4,Leonard>我们能不能不说这个话题了
<5-4,Leonard>Can we please just stop talking about it?

186
00:07:58,370 --> 00:07:59,990
<5-5,Penny>抱歉  那我能做点什么吗
<5-5,Penny>I'm sorry. What can I do?

187
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:01,960
<5-6,Leonard>不必了  我没事
<5-6,Leonard>Nothing, I'm fine.

188
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:04,390
<5-7,Penny>不不  我要让你开心起来
<5-7,Penny>No, no. I'm gonna cheer you up.

189
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:08,540
<5-7,Penny>有了
<5-7,Penny>Here we go.

190
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:09,530
<5-8,Leonard>我们要干嘛
<5-8,Leonard>What are we doing?

191
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,230
<5-9,Penny>我要带你去购物
<5-9,Penny>I am taking you shopping.

192
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:14,870
<5-11,Penny>我的宝贝不开心  我要让他开心起来
<5-11,Penny>My baby is sad, and I'm gonna make him happy again.

193
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,590
<5-12,Leonard>我知道购物能让你开心
<5-12,Leonard>Look, I know shopping cheers you up,

194
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:18,680
<5-12,Leonard>但我对这个真的不感兴趣
<5-12,Leonard>but it's just not really my thing.

195
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,330
<5-13,Penny>那这台直升飞机怎么样
<5-13,Penny>Well, what about this helicopter

196
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:22,510
<5-13,Penny>你可以通过iPad控制哦
<5-13,Penny>you control with an iPad?

197
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:24,240
<5-14,Leonard>里面有摄像头吗
<5-14,Leonard>Does it have a camera in it?

198
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:28,420
<5-15,Penny>里面有摄像头哦
<5-15,Penny>It does have a camera in it.

199
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,690
<5-16,Leonard>宝贝表示感兴趣
<5-16,Leonard>Baby's listening.

200
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,140
<5-17,Sheldon>莱纳德
<5-17,Sheldon>Leonard?

201
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,180
<5-17,Sheldon>莱纳德  莱纳德
<5-17,Sheldon>Leonard? Leonard?

202
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:35,930
<5-18,Leonard>干嘛
<5-18,Leonard>What?

203
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:38,640
<5-19,Sheldon>我跟杂志社的记者谈过了
<5-19,Sheldon>I spoke to the reporter at the magazine.

204
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:42,370
<5-20,Leonard>然后呢  你告诉他那是我的点子了吗
<5-20,Leonard>What happened? Did you tell him it was my idea?

205
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:43,570
<5-21,Sheldon>我说了
<5-21,Sheldon>I did.

206
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:45,550
<5-22,Leonard>谢谢  那他怎么说
<5-22,Leonard>Thank you. What did he say?

207
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:48,280
<5-23,Sheldon>他说编辑部最终决定
<5-23,Sheldon>He said they made the editorial decision

208
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,540
<5-23,Sheldon>只登出主导科学家
<5-23,Sheldon>to only cite the lead scientist.

209
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,780
<5-24,Leonard>他为什么会认为你才是主导科学家
<5-24,Leonard>Why did he think you're the lead scientist?

210
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,230
<5-20,Leonard>那可是我的点子啊
<5-20,Leonard>It was my idea!

211
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,520
<5-25,Penny>对了  多花四块钱
<5-25,Penny>You know, for an extra four bucks,

212
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,820
<5-25,Penny>明天直升机就送到家了哦
<5-25,Penny>I can have this thing here tomorrow.

213
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,540
<5-26,Sheldon>我知道那是你的点子
<5-26,Sheldon>Well, I know it was your idea,

214
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,120
<5-26,Sheldon>但那个记者说他关注我的研究有一段时间了
<5-26,Sheldon>but the reporter said he's been following my work for a while,

215
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,960
<5-26,Sheldon>他们杂志刊登那篇文章的唯一理由
<5-26,Sheldon>and the only reason they even mentioned it in the magazine

216
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,200
<5-26,Sheldon>就是因为我的名字在上面
<5-26,Sheldon>is 'cause my name is on it.

217
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,450
<5-27,Penny>算了  我买了  四块钱而已
<5-27,Penny>You know what? I did it. What's four bucks?

218
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:11,270
<5-28,Leonard>如果你的目的是想让我好过点
<5-28,Leonard>If you're trying to make me feel better,

219
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:12,690
<5-28,Leonard>你完全没成功
<5-28,Leonard>it's not working.

220
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:15,350
<5-29,Sheldon>好吧  那如果我告诉你
<5-29,Sheldon>Well... then what if I told you

221
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:18,340
<5-29,Sheldon>我在有线电视账单上加了你的名字呢
<5-29,Sheldon>that I added your name to the cable bill?

222
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:22,770
<5-30,Leonard>没用
<5-30,Leonard>No.

223
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,650
<5-31,Sheldon>反正也没加上  他们在电话里让我等了20分钟
<5-31,Sheldon>That's just as well. They had me on hold for 20 minutes

224
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:26,070
<5-31,Sheldon>我就挂了  我...
<5-31,Sheldon>and I hung up. I...

225
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,250
<5-31,Sheldon>莱纳德  莱纳德
<5-31,Sheldon>Leonard? Leonard?

226
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,070
<5-31,Sheldon>莱纳德
<5-31,Sheldon>Leonard?

227
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:38,140
<5-31,Sheldon>沃罗威茨邀请我们一起去吃饭  所以
<5-31,Sheldon>Also, Wolowitz invited us all to dinner, so...

228
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,970
<5-31,Sheldon>你准备好了我们就出发
<5-31,Sheldon>I'm ready whenever you are.

229
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:49,740
<6-1,Sheldon>他不就出了个点子吗
<6-1,Sheldon>All he had was an idea.

230
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,460
<6-2,Amy>点子也是很重要的啊
<6-2,Amy>Well, that is an important part.

231
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,860
<6-2,Amy>拜托
<6-2,Amy>Oh, please!

232
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,920
<6-3,Sheldon>我脑子里天天都有新点子
<6-3,Sheldon>I have ideas all day long.

233
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:59,260
<6-3,Sheldon>反转海洋公园  里面的海豚可以摸摸人类
<6-3,Sheldon>Reverse SeaWorld where dolphins are allowed to pet people.

234
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:04,990
<6-3,Sheldon>添加一个新尺寸  在中号和大号间加入中大号
<6-3,Sheldon>A new clothing size between medium and large called Marge.

235
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:08,090
<6-3,Sheldon>从小矮人中喷嚏精的角度重述《白雪公主》
<6-3,Sheldon>Snow White retold from the point of view of Sneezy.

236
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:09,990
<6-3,Sheldon>为什么万事通从不给他开药治喷嚏呢
<6-3,Sheldon>Why won't Doc prescribe him something?

237
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:11,870
<6-3,Sheldon>七个小矮人分别叫万事通  害羞鬼  瞌睡虫
<6-3,Sheldon>喷嚏精  开心果  迷糊鬼  爱生气

238
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:11,870
<6-3,Sheldon>我们总算可以知道了
<6-3,Sheldon>We finally find out.

239
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:15,020
<6-4,Amy>可莱纳德的点子真的不错啊
<6-4,Amy>But Leonard's idea was good.

240
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:19,830
<6-5,Sheldon>那就从爱生气的角度吧  他到底气什么呢
<6-5,Sheldon>Fine. Then Grumpy-- what's he so grumpy about?

241
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:22,760
<6-5,Sheldon>也许是气他女朋友胳膊肘往外拐吧
<6-5,Sheldon>Maybe his girlfriend won't take his side.

242
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,490
<7-1,Leonard>我才是提出点子的那个人
<7-1,Leonard>I'm the one who thought of it!

243
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:28,540
<7-2,Penny>可是很多部分不也都是他完成的吗
<7-2,Penny>Well, didn't he do a lot of the work?

244
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,670
<7-3,Leonard>但他现在沉醉于让别人以为
<7-3,Leonard>But now he's happy to let people think

245
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:33,040
<7-3,Leonard>一切都是他的功劳
<7-3,Leonard>he's responsible for everything.

246
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,050
<7-4,Penny>所以你才能得到平板遥控直升机嘛
<7-4,Penny>And that's why you get an iPad helicopter!

247
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:41,750
<7-4,Penny>名气比他大难道是我的错吗
<7-4,Penny>Is it my fault I have a much bigger reputation than he does?

248
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,020
<8-1,Sheldon>不是你的错
<8-1,Sheldon>It's not your fault.

249
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:45,030
<8-2,Amy>论文上我的名字按字母顺序排在他前面
<8-2,Amy>Is it my fault that my name came first

250
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:46,490
<8-3,Sheldon>这也是我的错吗
<8-3,Sheldon>on the paper alphabetically?

251
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:47,460
<8-4,Amy>不是你的错
<8-4,Amy>Not your fault.

252
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,310
<8-5,Sheldon>记者把我记为主导科学家我没有纠正他
<8-5,Sheldon>Is it my fault that when the reporter cited me

253
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:52,150
<8-5,Sheldon>这也是我的错吗
<8-5,Sheldon>as the lead scientist I didn't correct him?

254
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:55,110
<8-6,Amy>快看那只漂亮的小鸟
<8-6,Amy>Hey, look at that pretty bird.

255
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,860
<8-6,Amy>他总是需要成为众人的焦点
<8-6,Amy>He always needs all the attention.

256
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:58,950
<9-1,Leonard>跟个孩子一样
<9-1,Leonard>He's such a baby.

257
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,450
<9-2,Penny>我知道  我知道
<9-2,Penny>I know, I know.

258
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:03,890
<9-3,Leonard>我发誓  我的直升机永远不让他玩
<9-3,Leonard>I swear, he is never ever playing with my helicopter.

259

<10-1,Raj>我要开始加热这些东西了
<10-1,Raj>Okay, I'll start heating some of this stuff up.

<10-3,Howard>还有我犹太成年礼上剩的一块蛋糕
<10-3,Howard>...A piece of cake from my Bar Mitzvah.

264
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,150
<10-4,Bernadette>她真是什么都舍不得扔啊
<10-4,Bernadette>Did she throw anything away?

265
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,070
<10-4,Bernadette>是啊
<10-4,Bernadette>No.

00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,890
<10-9,Howard>以防我生病了
<10-9,Howard>in case I got sick.

275
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:58,750
<10-9,Howard>她觉得她的菜包治百病
<10-9,Howard>She thought she could cure anything with her cooking.

276
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:02,520
<10-9,Howard>甚至连食物中毒也能治
<10-9,Howard>Even the time I got food poisoning.

277
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,370
<10-9,Howard>其实就是她的菜害我中毒
<10-9,Howard>From her cooking.

283
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,270
<10-14,Bernadette>要不我让大家今天别来了
<10-14,Bernadette>Should we tell everyone not to come?

<11-4,Stuart>Yeah, turns out half a dozen menorahs really sets a mood.

292
00:12:58,050 --> 00:12:59,730
<11-5,Leonard>斯图尔特  如果霍华德卖掉了这房子
<11-5,Leonard>So, Stuart, have you thought about what you'd do

293
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:01,010
<11-5,Leonard>你要怎么办呢
<11-5,Leonard>if Howard sells the house?

294
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:03,440
<11-6,Stuart>气氛立马灰飞烟灭
<11-6,Stuart>And there goes the mood.

297
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:09,870
<11-7,Sheldon>因为他特别需要被提到名字

<11-14,Howard>heartburn that makes you pray for death.

00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:34,700
<11-15,Amy>需要去厨房帮你吗
<11-15,Amy>Do you need any help in the kitchen?

<11-21,Stuart>我听说你俩一起写了一篇论文啊
<11-21,Stuart>So I heard you two, uh, wrote a paper together.

313

<12-1,Penny>这些菜太好吃了
<12-1,Penny>This food is amazing.

315
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,000
<12-2,Raj>而且一点蔬菜也没有
<12-2,Raj>Mm, and not a vegetable in sight.

316
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:02,580
<12-3,Howard>错了
<12-3,Howard>That's not true.

317
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,650
<12-3,Howard>这里有好多"番茄"呢
<12-3,Howard>We've got tomatoes right here.

318
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:10,190
<12-4,Amy>一群聪明人围着烛光坐成一圈
<12-4,Amy>All these bright people sitting around a table by candlelight.

319
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:13,320
<12-4,Amy>感觉仿佛回到了18世纪的法国沙龙
<12-4,Amy>Feels like we could be an 18th century French salon.

320
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,070
<12-5,Sheldon>没错
<12-5,Sheldon>Indeed.

321
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,830
<12-5,Sheldon>佩妮  沙龙是指
<12-5,Sheldon>Penny, a salon is a gathering

322
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:20,000
<12-5,Sheldon>知识分子们围在一起
<12-5,Sheldon>where intellectuals entertained each other

323
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
<12-5,Sheldon>讨论时下最新的事件
<12-5,Sheldon>with sparkling conversations about issues of the day.

324
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,920
<12-6,Penny>所以就跟《访谈》节目一样嘛
<12-6,Penny>Oh, so it's like The View.

325
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:31,140
<12-7,Amy>谢尔顿  《访谈》是一档女性主持的日间节目
<12-7,Amy>Sheldon, The View is a daytime talk show hosted by women.

<12-8,Sheldon>我知道
<12-8,Sheldon>Oh, I'm aware.

327
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,180
<12-8,Sheldon>里面有琥碧·戈博

<12-8,Sheldon>她在《星际迷航·下一代》中扮演了吉南
<12-8,Sheldon>She played Guinan on Star Trek: Next Gen.

329
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:40,640
<12-8,Sheldon>佩妮  《下一代》是指
<12-8,Sheldon>Penny, Next Gen refers to

<12-9,Penny>-星际迷航的...  -闭嘴

331
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:46,610
<12-10,Raj>我愿意提一个沙龙话题
<12-10,Raj>I would like to propose a salon topic.

332
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:48,350
<12-11,Amy>愿听其详  拉杰什
<12-11,Amy>Ooh, please do, Rajesh.

333
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:50,310
<12-12,Raj>《饥饿游戏》的主角是女人
<12-12,Raj>The lead in The Hunger Games is a woman.

334
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,900
<12-12,Raj>漫威也将"托儿"改成了女性
<12-12,Raj>Marvel has made "Tor" a female.

335
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,040
<12-13,Penny>等等  谁是托儿
<12-13,Penny>Wait, who's Tor?

336
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,810
<12-14,Raj>你懂的吧  托儿  "雷神"啊
<12-14,Raj>You know, Tor, the God of "Tunder."

337
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,280
<12-14,Raj>综上所述  这是标志着
<12-14,Raj>As I was saying, is this a sign

338
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:06,560
<12-14,Raj>我们的社会逐步走向性别平等
<12-14,Raj>that our society is approaching gender equality?

339
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,130
<12-15,Howard>现在很多女性也爱看漫画了
<12-15,Howard>Certainly a lot more women are reading comic books now.

340
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:10,110
<12-15,Howard>这是真的
<12-15,Howard>It's true.

341
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:12,910
<12-16,Stuart>我还得为店里厕所装上个马桶坐垫
<12-16,Stuart>At the store, I had to put a seat on the toilet.

342
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:16,000
<12-17,Amy>在女索尔生孩子后
<12-17,Amy>We won't know if there's equality

343
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,630
<12-17,Amy>而其他复仇者们不介意
<12-17,Amy>until female Thor has a baby

344
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:20,850
<12-17,Amy>她在工作场所挤母乳之前  性别平等还很难说
<12-17,Amy>and the Avengers are cool with her pumping breast milk at work.

345
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:23,620
<12-18,Howard>我在想什么样的孩子才有资格
<12-18,Howard>I wonder if only a baby who is worthy

346
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:26,410
<12-18,Howard>能吸雷神的奶子
<12-18,Howard>can suckle at the bosom of Thor.

347
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,440
<12-19,Penny>新沙龙话题
<12-19,Penny>Okay, new salon topic.

348
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,860
<12-19,Penny>沙龙  是从很久以前就这么蠢
<12-19,Penny>Salons-- dumb thing from a long time ago

350
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:34,150
<12-19,Penny>还是本来挺好的  讨论起超级英雄才变蠢的
<12-19,Penny>or interesting thing made dumb by talking about superheroes?

351
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,730
<12-19,Penny>讨论开始
<12-19,Penny>Discuss.

352
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,110
<12-20,Sheldon>我觉得沙龙的话题并不重要
<12-20,Sheldon>I don't believe it matters what the topic is.

353
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:41,050
<12-20,Sheldon>沙龙重要的是
<12-20,Sheldon>What's crucial for a salon

354
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:42,590
<12-20,Sheldon>我们可以将讨论
<12-20,Sheldon>is that we conduct the discussion

355
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:45,080
<12-20,Sheldon>变得生动且有见解
<12-20,Sheldon>in an elevated and insightful way.

356
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,200
<12-20,Sheldon>重点在于如何执行
<12-20,Sheldon>It's all about the execution.

357
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,760
<12-21,Leonard>你当然注重执行  而不是注重灵感
<12-21,Leonard>Of course you'd focus on that rather than the inspiration.

358
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,200
<12-21,Leonard>新沙龙话题
<12-21,Leonard>Uh, new salon topic.

359
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,640
<12-21,Leonard>点子和执行力哪个更为重要
<12-21,Leonard>What's more important, an idea or its execution?

360
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,700
<12-22,Bernadette>这个好
<12-22,Bernadette>Oh, that's fun.

361
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,230
<12-23,Sheldon>说得不错  莱纳德
<12-23,Sheldon>Yeah, good for you, Leonard.

362
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:59,910
<12-23,Sheldon>这个观点很有趣
<12-23,Sheldon>That's a lovely little notion.

363
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,190
<12-23,Sheldon>就好比
<12-23,Sheldon>Kind of like,

364
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:03,790
<12-23,Sheldon>"我非常想跟我在芝加哥的舅舅通话"
<12-23,Sheldon>"I wish I could talk to my uncle in Chicago."

365
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:06,940
<12-23,Sheldon>行  先闪边  我发明电话去
<12-23,Sheldon>Yeah, now stand back while I invent the telephone.

366
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,770
<12-23,Sheldon>"您好  请稍等"
<12-23,Sheldon>"Hello? Oh, hold on."

367
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:09,900
<12-23,Sheldon>莱纳德  是你舅
<12-23,Sheldon>Leonard, it's your uncle.

368
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,110
<12-23,Sheldon>他说你炸了
<12-23,Sheldon>He says you just got burned.

369
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:14,220
<12-24,Amy>谢尔顿
<12-24,Amy>Sheldon.

370
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:14,910
<12-24,Amy>你们俩
<12-24,Amy>You guys.

371
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:15,890
<12-25,Penny>没事
<12-25,Penny>No, it's okay.

372
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:18,740
<12-26,Leonard>我们都是成人  正在进行知识上的探讨
<12-26,Leonard>We're all adults trying to have an intelligent discussion.

373
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:19,540
<12-26,Leonard>至少我是这样
<12-26,Leonard>At least I am.

374
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,170
<12-26,Leonard>霍华德你觉得呢
<12-26,Leonard>Howard, what do you think?

375
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:23,930
<12-27,Howard>我作为一名工程师
<12-27,Howard>Well, I guess, as an engineer,

376
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:25,930
<12-27,Howard>我的答案倾向于执行
<12-27,Howard>lean towards execution.

377
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:27,910
<12-27,Howard>我的工作就是将点子
<12-27,Howard>I spend my days trying to take

378
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:30,120
<12-27,Howard>变成为真实的东西
<12-27,Howard>ideas and make them real.

379
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,140
<12-28,Sheldon>说的好  老兄
<12-28,Sheldon>Well said, old chap.

380
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:34,790
<12-28,Sheldon>谁说世人再无雄辩  我们面前不就是吗
<12-28,Sheldon>I thought eloquence had died; here it stands before us.

381
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,600
<12-28,Sheldon>从今天开始  刚才那段话与葛底斯堡演说
<12-28,Sheldon>Starting today, it'll go: Gettysburg Address,

382
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:38,740
<12-28,Sheldon>葛底斯堡演说是美国林肯总统最伟大与著名的演说
<12-28,Sheldon>《我有一个梦想》则是马丁·路德·金最著名的一场演说

383
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,740
<12-28,Sheldon>还有《我有一个梦想》齐名
<12-28,Sheldon>"I have a dream" and what you just said.

384
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:40,960
<12-29,Leonard>现在他就是天才啦
<12-29,Leonard>Oh, now he's a genius?

385
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,330
<12-29,Leonard>你以前不是一直嘲笑他是工程师吗
<12-29,Leonard>All you ever do is make fun of him and engineering.

386
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:45,790
<12-30,Sheldon>莱纳德  注意点  人家才刚刚丧母
<12-30,Sheldon>Leonard, please. His mother just died.

387
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:48,280
<12-31,Leonard>你真是要笑死人
<12-31,Leonard>You're being ridiculous.

388
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,020
<12-32,Sheldon>你也是
<12-32,Sheldon>Yeah, so are you.

389
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,650
<12-33,Penny>同志们  如果要听撕逼
<12-33,Penny>Guys, if I wanted to hear people be bitchy,

390
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:52,710
<12-33,Penny>我就去我的美发沙龙了
<12-33,Penny>I'd go to my real salon.

391
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:55,050
<12-34,Sheldon>莱纳德  很多人都可以有过那点子
<12-34,Sheldon>Leonard, lots of people could've had that idea,

392
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:57,790
<12-34,Sheldon>但只有少数人能像我一样去实现它
<12-34,Sheldon>but very few people could've worked out the math the way I did.

393
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:00,590
<12-35,Leonard>还有很多人提不出这样的点子呢
<12-35,Leonard>Lots of people also didn't have that idea,

394
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:03,160
<12-35,Leonard>比如除了我以外的全世界
<12-35,Leonard>like everyone in the entire world except for me.

395
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,310
<12-36,Sheldon>看来莱纳德觉得自己
<12-36,Sheldon>Oh, well, apparently Leonard thinks

396
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:07,420
<12-36,Sheldon>比全世界所有人都强
<12-36,Sheldon>he's better than everyone in the whole world,

397
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,680
<12-36,Sheldon>包括为我们的自由而战的人们
<12-36,Sheldon>including those fighting for our freedom.

398
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,850
<12-36,Sheldon>我不知道你怎么想的
<12-36,Sheldon>Yeah, well, I don't know about you,

399
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:13,470
<12-36,Sheldon>但我支持我国在海外的英雄们
<12-36,Sheldon>but I support our boys overseas.

400
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:15,980
<12-37,Amy>还有英雌们
<12-37,Amy>And girls.

401
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:18,330
<12-38,Sheldon>你已经把雷神毁了  歇会吧你
<12-38,Sheldon>Hey, you already ruined Thor; give it a rest.

402
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,320
<12-39,Leonard>所以我就活该忍受
<12-39,Leonard>So I'm just supposed to be okay

403
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,350
<12-39,Leonard>你把功劳都霸占了
<12-39,Leonard>with you hogging all the credit?!

404
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:25,170
<12-40,Sheldon>我什么都没霸占
<12-40,Sheldon>I didn't hog anything.

405
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:28,890
<12-40,Sheldon>不像你  霸占着那坨有葡萄干的千层面
<12-40,Sheldon>Unlike you and that weird lasagna with raisins in it.

406
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:29,710
<12-41,Leonard>你想要吗
<12-41,Leonard>You want some of this?

407
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:30,480
<12-41,Leonard>我赏你一顿饱啊
<12-41,Leonard>I'll give you some.

408
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:33,720
<12-42,Bernadette>谢尔顿  莱纳德  马上给我去客厅
<12-42,Bernadette>Sheldon, Leonard, living room, right now!

409
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,920
<12-43,Sheldon>她先叫的我  你嫉妒死了吧
<12-43,Sheldon>She said my name first; that must kill you.

410
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,230
<12-43,Sheldon>我不知道你俩是要闹哪样
<12-43,Sheldon>I don't know what you think you're doing,

411
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,740
<12-44,Bernadette (off)>但我老公现在可是很难过
<12-44,Bernadette (off)>but this is a very difficult time for my husband!

412
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:50,240
<12-44,Bernadette (off)>我们吃的是他老妈最后做的食物
<12-44,Bernadette (off)>We're eating the last food his mother ever made,

413
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,830
<12-44,Bernadette (off)>你们俩还想学熊孩子  把饭拿起来乱扔吗
<12-44,Bernadette (off)>and you were gonna throw it at each other like children?!

414
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:55,290
<12-44,Bernadette (off)>不管你俩吵什么玩意  给我憋回去
<12-44,Bernadette (off)>Whatever it is you're fighting about, put it aside,

415
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:57,240
<12-44,Bernadette (off)>滚回桌子乖乖当好霍华德的朋友
<12-44,Bernadette (off)>go back in there and be a good friend to Howard

416
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,110
<12-44,Bernadette (off)>不然甜点没你俩的份
<12-44,Bernadette (off)>or there's no dessert for either of you!

417
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,370
<12-44,Bernadette (off)>我在跟你们说话呢  看着我
<12-44,Bernadette (off)>Look at me when I'm talking to you!

418
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:05,980
<13-1,Penny>别想...
<13-1,Penny>And don't think...

419
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,820
<12-45,Howard>你们注意到
<12-45,Howard>You guys ever notice sometimes

420
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,340
<12-45,Howard>有时候博纳黛特和我妈说话有点像吗
<12-45,Howard>Bernadette sounds like my mom?

421
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,090
<12-46,Amy>没听出来啊
<12-46,Amy>I don't hear it.

422
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:13,440
<12-47,Raj>哪有  完全没有
<12-47,Raj>No, not at all.

423
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:29,070
<13-1,Penny>我这辈子没吃过这么撑
<13-1,Penny>I don't think I've eaten that much in my entire life.

424
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:32,420
<13-2,Howard>所以我们族人在沙漠里暴走了四十年
<13-2,Howard>It's why my people wandered the desert for 40 years.

425
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:34,580
<13-2,Howard>犹太人祖先出走埃及后
<13-2,Howard>曾在沙漠度过40年的漂泊帐篷生活

426
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,580
<13-2,Howard>才能把肚子里的东西消化掉
<13-2,Howard>Took that long to walk it off.

427
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,640
<13-3,Sheldon>佩妮  是这样的  以色列人在沙漠中...
<13-3,Sheldon>You see, Penny, the Israelites were in the desert...

428
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,280
<13-4,Penny>闭嘴
<13-4,Penny>Shut up!

429
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,380
<13-5,Ra>太高兴你俩不吵了
<13-5,Ra>So glad you two are done fighting.

430
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:48,260
<13-6,Leonard>现在我只想怎么把嗝打出来才不会吐
<13-6,Leonard>Right now, I'm just trying to burp without throwing up.

431
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,360
<13-7,Sheldon>等等
<13-7,Sheldon>Hang on.

432
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,790
<13-7,Sheldon>《今日物理》提到了我们的论文
<13-7,Sheldon>Physics Today mentioned the paper.

433
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:53,930
<13-8,Stuart>他们怎么说
<13-8,Stuart>What'd they say?

434
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:56,420
<13-9,Amy>谁在乎  他们提莱纳德了吗
<13-9,Amy>Who cares? Did they mention Leonard?

435
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,750
<13-10,Sheldon>提到了
<13-10,Sheldon>They did.

436
