00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,060
<4-1,Sheldon>《生活大爆炸》  前情提要
<4-1,Sheldon>Previously on The Big Bang Theory...

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:07,840
<6-18,Raj>我们现在正式宣布你们成为夫妻
<6-18,Raj>We now pronounce you husband and wife!

3
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,050
<6-19,Amy>我爱死这部分了
<6-19,Amy>I love this part!

4
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:13,650
<6-20,Raj>我也爱
<6-20,Raj>Me, too!

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,390
<6-21,Sheldon>我内心五味杂陈啊
<6-21,Sheldon>I have strongly mixed feelings!

6
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,920
<1-1,Stuart>霍华德真的上太空啦
<1-1,Stuart>So, Howard's really in space, huh?

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,820
<1-2,Leonard>对啊  在国际太空站呢
<1-2,Leonard>Mm-hmm, International Space Station.

8
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,990
<1-2,Leonard>在我们头上250英里外
<1-2,Leonard>250 miles that way.

9
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:28,720
<1-3,Raj>此时此刻  霍华德正从上方俯视这星球
<1-3,Raj>Right now, Howard's staring down at our planet

10
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,250
<1-3,Raj>像一个小版的犹太希腊神
<1-3,Raj>like a tiny Jewish Greek god.

11
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,320
<1-3,Raj>沃罗威宙斯
<1-3,Raj>Zeusowitz.

12
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,680
<1-4,Sheldon>我不得不承认
<1-4,Sheldon>I must admit,

13
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,180
<1-4,Sheldon>我心里实在是有点小嫉妒
<1-4,Sheldon>I can't help but feel a twinge of envy.

14
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,650
<1-4,Sheldon>他只需往窗外一看
<1-4,Sheldon>He can look out the window

15
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:42,850
<1-4,Sheldon>壮丽宏伟的宇宙
<1-4,Sheldon>and see the majesty of the universe

16
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:44,950
<1-4,Sheldon>便尽收眼底
<1-4,Sheldon>unfolding before his eyes.

17
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,450
<1-4,Sheldon>尽收他那浑浊愚昧的眼底
<1-4,Sheldon>His dim, uncomprehending eyes.

18
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:54,810
<1-4,Sheldon>就像放在机场宠物运输箱里的猫
<1-4,Sheldon>It's like a cat in an airport carrying case.

19
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,480
<1-5,Leonard>其实在太空也没这么好啦
<1-5,Leonard>You know, it's not exactly glamorous up there.

20
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,930
<1-5,Leonard>宇航员所喝的水
<1-5,Leonard>The water that the astronauts drink

21
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:02,430
<1-5,Leonard>都是过滤其他宇航员的尿得来的
<1-5,Leonard>is made from each other's recycled urine.

22
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,210
<1-6,Stuart>感觉一定不错
<1-6,Stuart>Must be nice.

23
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,950
<1-6,Stuart>我身上排出的各种液体都没人想要
<1-6,Stuart>Nobody wants anything that comes out of me.

24
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,950
<1-7,Raj>真好奇此时此刻他在太空干嘛
<1-7,Raj>I wonder what he's doing right this very second.

25
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,670
<1-8,Leonard>在零重力的状态下做实验
<1-8,Leonard>Mm, conducting experiments in zero gravity.

26
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:21,140
<1-9,Raj>透过望远镜看着宇宙的生成
<1-9,Raj>Peering through his telescope at the birth of the cosmos.

27
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:24,650
<1-10,Sheldon>无论是什么  他的生活再也不同了
<1-10,Sheldon>Whatever it is, we know his life will never be the same.

28
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:28,710
<2-1,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>霍华德  你听得到我吗
<2-1,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>Howard! Can you hear me?!

29
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,410
<2-2,Howard>不用打电话我都能听到你在地球吼
<2-2,Howard>I can hear you without the phone!

30
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,810
<2-3,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>别这么暴躁
<2-3,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>Don't be snippy.

31
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:36,370
<2-3,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>我只是很兴奋能跟我小宝贝说话
<2-3,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>I'm just excited to talk to my baby!

32
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:39,070
<2-4,Howard>我也很兴奋啊
<2-4,Howard>I'm excited to talk to you, too.

33
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:41,810
<2-5,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>有个疯狂的谣言说你要搬走
<2-5,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>So, what's this mishegas about you moving out

34
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,690
<2-5,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>去跟那个波兰妞同居是怎么回事
<2-5,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>to go live with the little Polish girl?!

35
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,880
<2-6,Howard>你就不能称呼她为我老婆吗
<2-6,Howard>How about calling her my wife?

36
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,510
<2-7,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>老婆才不会害人家母子分离
<2-7,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>Wives don't take boys from their mothers.

37
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:53,390
<2-8,Howard>就是因为她们会  所以才要娶她们
<2-8,Howard>They do. That's why we marry them!

38
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,440
<2-9,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>我只希望在你回来之前
<2-9,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>I just hope I'm not dead from a broken heart

39
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,110
<2-9,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>我没有心碎而亡
<2-9,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>before you get back.

40
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:00,670
<2-10,Howard>妈  别这样
<2-10,Howard>Ma, please.

41
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:03,910
<2-10,Howard>太空总署的人都在听我们讲电话
<2-10,Howard>Everyone from NASA is listening to this phone call.

42
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:07,510
<2-11,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>很好  这样他们就知道你有多不孝了
<2-11,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>Good. They should know what a horrible son you are!

43
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:10,630
<2-12,Howard>好啦  妈  下次再聊  挂啦
<2-12,Howard>Okay, Ma, great talking to you! Gotta go!

44
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,230
<2-12,Howard>太空之旅  被毁得一干二净
<2-12,Howard>Well... space is ruined.

46
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,370
<3-1,Amy>好兴奋哦
<3-1,Amy>This is so exciting.

47
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:55,060
<3-1,Amy>我唇上的汗毛很快会跟我美丽好友一样
<3-1,Amy>Soon, my upper lip will be the same fake blonde

48
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,740
<3-1,Amy>有着好看的假金色了
<3-1,Amy>as my beautiful best friend.

49
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,580
<3-2,Penny>我天生就是这个色
<3-2,Penny>Hey, this is my natural hair color.

50
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,000
<3-2,Penny>好吧  现在
<3-2,Penny>Now.

51
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:07,140
<3-2,Penny>谢尔顿有替你们俩明晚
<3-2,Penny>So, does Sheldon have anything special

52
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,770
<3-2,Penny>做什么特殊安排吗
<3-2,Penny>planned for you tomorrow night?

53
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:11,580
<3-3,Amy>当然有  根据恋爱协议
<3-3,Amy>Oh, yes. According to the Relationship Agreement,

54
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,330
<3-3,Amy>我们的首次约会周年纪念日
<3-3,Amy>on the anniversary of our first date,

55
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:14,880
<3-3,Amy>他得带我去吃顿好的
<3-3,Amy>he must take me to a nice dinner,

56
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,130
<3-3,Amy>关心我那天的生活琐事
<3-3,Amy>ask about my day

57
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:18,120
<3-3,Amy>然后对我做出一些肢体接触
<3-3,Amy>and engage in casual physical contact

58
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,740
<3-3,Amy>是让旁观者都觉得我们很亲密的那种哦
<3-3,Amy>that a disinterested onlooker might mistake for intimacy.

59
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,370
<3-4,Penny>香艳火辣啊
<3-4,Penny>That's hot.

60
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,690
<3-4,Penny>记得使用"防护措施"哦
<3-4,Penny>You kids better use protection.

61
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,920
<3-5,Amy>这得等多久
<3-5,Amy>How long does this stay on?

62
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,040
<3-6,Penny>就几分钟吧
<3-6,Penny>Just a couple of minutes.

63
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,570
<3-6,Penny>你以前没试过染汗毛吗
<3-6,Penny>You've really never done this before?

64
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:34,870
<3-7,Amy>高中时候试过一次  后来打盹
<3-7,Amy>Once in high school, but I dozed off

65
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:37,570
<3-7,Amy>醒来之后  我脸上就二级化学灼伤了
<3-7,Amy>and woke up with second-degree chemical burns on my face.

66
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,040
<3-8,Penny>天啊  那也太惨了吧
<3-8,Penny>Oh, my gosh, that's awful.

67
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,470
<3-8,Penny>其他同学有取笑你吗
<3-8,Penny>The other kids make fun of you?

68
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,650
<3-9,Amy>没有  我编了借口
<3-9,Amy>No, I had a cover story;

69
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:44,280
<3-9,Amy>我说那是疱疹[性病]
<3-9,Amy>I told everyone it was herpes.

70
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,390
<3-9,Amy>那你跟莱纳德一切如何啊
<3-9,Amy>So, how's everything going with you and Leonard?

71
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,510
<3-10,Penny>不知道  还是有点怪
<3-10,Penny>I don't know, it's still kind of weird.

72
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,820
<3-10,Penny>他上次的做爱中乱求婚的事
<3-10,Penny>We haven't really recovered since he proposed to me

73
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,110
<3-10,Penny>我们还没缓过来
<3-10,Penny>in the middle of sex.

74
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,980
<3-11,Amy>你倒好
<3-11,Amy>Oh. Boo-hoo.

75
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:58,770
<3-11,Amy>要是谢尔顿在我们做爱的时候求婚
<3-11,Amy>If Sheldon proposed to me during sex,

76
00:03:58,770 --> 00:03:59,860
<3-11,Amy>我的子宫一定会紧紧夹住他那里
<3-11,Amy>my ovaries would grab on to him

77
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,260
<3-11,Amy>不放他走
<3-11,Amy>and never let go.

78
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:11,850
<4-1,Sheldon>莱纳德  你同不同意人择原理
<4-1,Sheldon>Leonard, where do you stand on the anthropic principle?

79
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:12,890
<4-2,Leonard>这问题有意思
<4-2,Leonard>Interesting question.

80
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:14,220
<4-2,Leonard>一方面来说  我一直...
<4-2,Leonard>On the one hand, I always thought...

81
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,550
<4-2,Leonard>你根本就不知道那是什么  对吧
<4-2,Leonard>You don't even know what it is, do you?

82
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:20,930
<4-3,Sheldon>人择原理指出如果我们想解释
<4-3,Sheldon>The anthropic principle states that if we wish to explain

83
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:23,220
<4-3,Sheldon>为何宇宙是我们看到的这种样子
<4-3,Sheldon>why our universe exists the way it does,

84
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,070
<4-3,Sheldon>那会是因为它必须像现在这样
<4-3,Sheldon>the answer is that it must have qualities

85
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,540
<4-3,Sheldon>演化出能问出这道问题的智慧生物
<4-3,Sheldon>that allow intelligent creatures to arise

86
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,680
<4-3,Sheldon>才会有这个问题的出现
<4-3,Sheldon>who are capable of asking the question.

87
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,980
<4-3,Sheldon>而我现在就正问着这问题呢
<4-3,Sheldon>As I am doing so eloquently right now.

88
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,710
<4-4,Leonard>我知道人择原理是什么
<4-4,Leonard>I know what the anthropic principle is.

89
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,000
<4-5,Sheldon>当然啊  我刚给你解释完
<4-5,Sheldon>Of course. I just explained it to you.

90
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:43,210
<4-6,Leonard>那你是同意还是反对呢
<4-6,Leonard>Now, where do you stand on it?

91
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:45,360
<4-6,Leonard>-你同意吗  -非常同意
<4-6,Leonard>- Where do you stand on it? - Strongly pro.

92
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,090
<4-8,Leonard>那我就相信是神花了六天创世
<4-8,Leonard>Then I believe that God created the world in six days,

93
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:50,580
<4-8,Leonard>然后在第七天  造了你来烦我
<4-8,Leonard>and on the seventh, he made you to annoy me.

94
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,310
<4-9,Raj>你们俩好啊
<4-9,Raj>Hey, guys.

95
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,390
<4-11,Sheldon>对了  拉杰
<4-11,Sheldon>Yeah, wait, Raj,

96
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:59,760
<4-11,Sheldon>你同不同意人择原理呢
<4-11,Sheldon>where do you stand on the anthropic principle?

97
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,860
<4-12,Raj>-完全同意  -好孩子
<4-12,Raj>- I'm all for it. - Attaboy!

98
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,190
<4-14,Leonard>等等  为什么你觉得他懂
<4-14,Leonard>Well, hang on. Why do you believe

99
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,970
<4-14,Leonard>而我不懂什么是人择原理呢
<4-14,Leonard>that he knows what it is and I don't?

100
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:07,640
<4-15,Sheldon>莱纳德  还是别了吧
<4-15,Sheldon>Oh, Leonard. Let's not take a saw

101
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,240
<4-15,Sheldon>这说出来多伤感情啊
<4-15,Sheldon>to the branch we're sitting on, shall we?

102
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,560
<4-16,Raj>你们俩如果今晚有空
<4-16,Raj>Hey, uh, if you guys are free tonight,

103
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,900
<4-16,Raj>我听说有家SPA  你可以一边泡脚
<4-16,Raj>I heard about a SPA where you soak your feet

104
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,460
<4-16,Raj>水里还会有小鱼
<4-16,Raj>in a pool full of little fish

105
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,470
<4-16,Raj>帮你吃掉你脚上的死皮哦
<4-16,Raj>that eat all the dead skin right off them.

106
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,760
<4-16,Raj>不用我说你们也知道  在洛杉矶
<4-16,Raj>I don't need to tell you, in Los Angeles,

107
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,320
<4-16,Raj>全年都是拖鞋季
<4-16,Raj>sandal season is year round.

108
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,470
<4-17,Leonard>-其实我跟佩妮有约了  -好吧
<4-17,Leonard>- Actually, I'm hanging out with Penny. - Oh, okay.

109
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:30,210
<4-18,Raj>那就剩咱俩去了  谢尔顿
<4-18,Raj>Sounds like it's me and you, Sheldon.

110
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:32,680
<4-18,Raj>一起去让小鱼帮我们打磨一下脚吧
<4-18,Raj>How about we sic some guppies on those puppies?

111
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,540
<4-19,Sheldon>我说过无数次了
<4-19,Sheldon>As I've stated before on numerous occasions,

112
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:39,560
<4-19,Sheldon>我唯一能接受被它吃掉的海洋生物
<4-19,Sheldon>the only sea creature I would even consider being eaten by

113
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,790
<4-19,Sheldon>就是北海巨妖
<4-19,Sheldon>is the Kraken,

114
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:42,780
<4-19,Sheldon>因为我死前听到的最后一句话是
<4-19,Sheldon>because the last words I would hear are:

115
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,420
<4-19,Sheldon>"放北海巨妖"[电影《诸神之战》台词]
<4-19,Sheldon>"Release the Kraken."

116
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,850
<4-19,Sheldon>这句话百听不厌
<4-19,Sheldon>That never gets old.

117
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,160
<4-19,Sheldon>"放北海巨妖"
<4-19,Sheldon>"Release the Kraken!"

118
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,930
<4-19,Sheldon>好怕怕哟
<4-19,Sheldon>Oh, chills.

119
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:53,540
<4-19,Sheldon>再说了  我要跟艾米吃晚餐
<4-19,Sheldon>Besides, I'm having dinner with Amy.

120
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:56,270
<4-20,Raj>好吧  那我回家一个人待着好了
<4-20,Raj>Oh, okay. I'll just go home and be alone.

121
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,370
<4-20,Raj>这样也蛮好
<4-20,Raj>W-Which is cool.

122
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:00,520
<4-20,Raj>我一个人吃  一个人睡  一个人默默流泪
<4-20,Raj>I eat alone, I sleep alone, I cry alone, so...

123
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,750
<4-20,Raj>蛮好
<4-20,Raj>Cool.

124
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,010
<4-21,Sheldon>真可惜
<4-21,Sheldon>Darn.

125
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:08,690
<4-21,Sheldon>如果你不忙  我还想请你跟我们一起晚餐呢
<4-21,Sheldon>If you weren't busy, I'd ask you to join us.

126
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,420
<4-22,Raj>真的吗  我可以去吗  谢谢
<4-22,Raj>Really? I can come? Thanks!

127
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,690
<4-23,Leonard>谢尔顿  你跟艾米的约会之夜
<4-23,Leonard>Sheldon, are you sure you want to be bringing Raj

128
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:15,910
<4-23,Leonard>你确定要带拉杰去吗
<4-23,Leonard>on your date night with Amy?

129
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:17,710
<4-24,Sheldon>当然
<4-24,Sheldon>Oh, absolutely.

130
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:22,250
<4-24,Sheldon>根据契约规定  我得跟艾米聊天
<4-24,Sheldon>I have a contractual obligation to provide Amy with conversation

131
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,160
<4-24,Sheldon>并有肢体接触
<4-24,Sheldon>and casual physical contact,

132
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,890
<4-24,Sheldon>但是没有地方明确指出
<4-24,Sheldon>but nowhere is it specified

133
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:29,040
<4-24,Sheldon>我不能把这项义务外包给印度人
<4-24,Sheldon>that I can't outsource that to an Indian.

134
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,230
<5-1,Bernadette (on webcam)>华仔
<5-1,Bernadette (on webcam)>Howie?

135
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,090
<5-1,Bernadette (on webcam)>华仔
<5-1,Bernadette (on webcam)>Howie?

136
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:40,190
<5-2,Howard>我美丽的新娘子
<5-2,Howard>Hey, there's my beautiful bride!

137
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,160
<5-2,Howard>你可以看见我吗
<5-2,Howard>Can you see me?

138
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,660
<5-3,Bernadette>可以  你还好吗
<5-3,Bernadette>I can. How are you?

139
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,050
<5-4,Howard>棒极了
<5-4,Howard>I'm amazing.

140
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:47,450
<5-4,Howard>而且是比我梦想中的还要棒
<5-4,Howard>I mean, this is even better than I dreamed.

141
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:52,180
<5-4,Howard>当我看出窗外  一切都是那么难以置信
<5-4,Howard>I look out the window, and... it's all so unbelievable.

142
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,550
<5-5,Bernadette>那就好
<5-5,Bernadette>Good for you.

143
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:56,970
<5-5,Bernadette>我刚跟你妈吃了一顿没完没了的晚餐
<5-5,Bernadette>I just had a seemingly endless dinner with your mom.

144
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:01,200
<5-6,Howard>是吗  那不错啊
<5-6,Howard>Oh, yeah? That's nice.

145
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:03,910
<5-7,Bernadette>一开始还不错  直到我发现你没告诉她
<5-7,Bernadette>It was. Until I found out you never told her

146
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:05,400
<5-7,Bernadette>我们要搬出去住
<5-7,Bernadette>we're not gonna live with her.

147
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,240
<5-7,Bernadette>咱们来好好聊聊这件事吧
<5-7,Bernadette>Let's talk about that for a minute.

148
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,730
<5-8,Howard>快看  这根笔在飘浮耶
<5-8,Howard>Hey, look, this pen is floating.

149
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,360
<5-8,Howard>很不可思议吧
<5-8,Howard>How crazy is that?

150
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:21,670
<5-9,Bernadette>你说过会告诉她  可你没有
<5-9,Bernadette>You said you told her, but you never did!

151
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:24,990
<5-10,Howard>好吧  我知道你很失望  可...
<5-10,Howard>Okay, okay, I know you're upset, but...

152
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,610
<5-10,Howard>不如我跟你分享下  我来这学到的道理吧
<5-10,Howard>let me share something I've learned since I got here.

153
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:33,850
<5-10,Howard>当你从太空中往下看地球时
<5-10,Howard>You realize how small your problems are

154
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:37,040
<5-10,Howard>你会意识到自己的难题  根本微不足道
<5-10,Howard>when you're looking down on them from space.

155
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,190
<5-10,Howard>拜托  听完之后应该开心点了吧
<5-10,Howard>Now, come on, that's got to make you feel better.

156
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:43,360
<5-11,Bernadette>你在屏幕上看我有多清晰呀
<5-11,Bernadette>How clear is the image of me on that screen?

157
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,890
<5-12,Howard>蛮清晰的
<5-12,Howard>Pretty clear.

158
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,460
<5-13,Bernadette>我看起来像有开心点吗
<5-13,Bernadette>Do I look like I feel better?

159
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:51,080
<5-14,Howard>也没有到高清画质啦
<5-14,Howard>I mean, it's not, like, HD quality.

160
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,540
<5-15,Bernadette>你给我听好了  快去跟你妈妈说
<5-15,Bernadette>Listen, mister, you're gonna talk to your mother

161
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,780
<5-15,Bernadette>把这件事给老娘处理好  不然之前答应你
<5-15,Bernadette>and you're gonna fix this, or that thing I said

162
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,860
<5-15,Bernadette>你一回家就给你的"服务"
<5-15,Bernadette>I was gonna do to you the minute you got home,

163
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,000
<5-15,Bernadette>你就准备"自己来"吧
<5-15,Bernadette>you can do to yourself.

164
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,680
<5-16,Dimitri>打从他上太空  就没少"来"过
<5-16,Dimitri>Like he's been doing since he got here.

165
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:15,470
<6-1,Amy>谢尔顿  这地方好浪漫啊
<6-1,Amy>Sheldon, this place is so romantic.

166
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,090
<6-2,Sheldon>很高兴你喜欢
<6-2,Sheldon>Oh, I'm glad you like it.

167
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:18,480
<6-2,Sheldon>是拉杰选的
<6-2,Sheldon>Raj picked it out.

168
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,520
<6-3,Amy>你下次看见他  帮我说声谢谢
<6-3,Amy>Well, when you see him, tell him I say thank you.

169
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,240
<6-4,Sheldon>你可以自己跟他说
<6-4,Sheldon>Tell him yourself.

170
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,750
<6-5,Raj>这边这边
<6-5,Raj>Over here!

171
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,110
<6-6,Amy>我不懂  他在这里干嘛
<6-6,Amy>I don't understand. What's he doing here?

172
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,220
<6-7,Sheldon>是我邀请他的
<6-7,Sheldon>I invited him.

173
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:35,440
<6-8,Amy>来当电灯泡吗
<6-8,Amy>On our date?

174
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,220
<6-8,Amy>谢尔顿  这样属于违约
<6-8,Amy>Sheldon, that's not okay.

175
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,780
<6-9,Sheldon>才没有
<6-9,Sheldon>Yes, it is.

176
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:41,920
<6-9,Sheldon>我们的恋爱协议有个漏洞
<6-9,Sheldon>There's a loophole in the Relationship Agreement.

177
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,690
<6-10,Amy>你居然发现了个漏洞
<6-10,Amy>You found a loophole?

178
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:49,330
<6-11,Raj>抱歉我先点了  我有点小紧张
<6-11,Raj>Sorry I started without you. I'm a little nervous.

179
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:51,730
<6-11,Raj>我很久没约过会了
<6-11,Raj>It's been a long time since I've been on a date.

180
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,940
<6-12,Amy>真不敢相信我居然为了今天  漂白了胡子
<6-12,Amy>I can't believe I bleached my mustache for this.

181
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,180
<6-13,Raj>你应该找我那个美容师
<6-13,Raj>You should go to my girl.

182
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,640
<6-13,Raj>她还能免费帮你把鬓脚修掉
<6-13,Raj>She'll knock out those sideburns for free.

183
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,720
<6-14,Raj>艾米  我觉得
<6-14,Raj>You know, Amy, I don't even think

184
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,990
<6-14,Raj>我们俩都没好好聊过
<6-14,Raj>you and I have had a real conversation.

185
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:13,320
<6-14,Raj>不如今晚就让我们加深对彼此的了解吧
<6-14,Raj>Let's use tonight to get to know each other a little better.

186
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:15,170
<6-14,Raj>你先开始
<6-14,Raj>You start.

187
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:20,170
<6-15,Amy>滚回家
<6-15,Amy>Go home.

188
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,980
<6-16,Raj>我没听懂
<6-16,Raj>I don't understand.

189
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,220
<6-17,Amy>谢尔顿  你怎么能这样呢
<6-17,Amy>Sheldon, how could you do this?

190
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,980
<6-17,Amy>这是我们的两周年纪念日
<6-17,Amy>It's our second anniversary.

191
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,900
<6-18,Raj>今天是你们的纪念日啊
<6-18,Raj>It's your anniversary?!

192
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,830
<6-18,Raj>天啊  我真的不知道
<6-18,Raj>Oh, my God, I had no idea.

193
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:32,480
<6-18,Raj>艾米  拜托让我将功补过
<6-18,Raj>Amy, please, let me make this right.

194
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:33,100
<6-19,Amy>谢谢
<6-19,Amy>Thank you.

195
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,430
<6-20,Raj>这是我的荣幸  服务员
<6-20,Raj>My pleasure. Waiter?

196
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,260
<6-20,Raj>香槟一瓶  杯子三个
<6-20,Raj>A bottle of champagne and three glasses.

197
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:41,130
<6-20,Raj>天啊  这是不是很浪漫呀
<6-20,Raj>Oh, boy, isn't this romantic?

198
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:43,790
<6-21,Sheldon>我希望这是个反问句
<6-21,Sheldon>Oh, I hope that's a rhetorical question,

199
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,960
<6-21,Sheldon>因为我真不知道浪不浪漫
<6-21,Sheldon>because I have no clue.

200
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,270
<7-1,Penny>真棒  今天是什么日子
<7-1,Penny>This is great. What's the occasion?

201
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:51,520
<7-2,Leonard>什么都不是
<7-2,Leonard>No occasion.

202
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,790
<7-2,Leonard>你也知道  我们最近关系有点怪怪的
<7-2,Leonard>You know, things have been a little weird between us,

203
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:56,530
<7-2,Leonard>所以我想为你准备一个开心的夜晚
<7-2,Leonard>so I wanted to throw together a fun night just for you.

204
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:58,620

<7-4,Leonard>We can watch the football game.

207
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,270

<7-4,Leonard>I even painted my stomach.

208
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:08,010
<7-5,Penny>"体育万岁"
<7-5,Penny>"Go sports"?

209
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:09,440
<7-6,Leonard>以防你突然想换成看棒球
<7-6,Leonard>in case you were in the mood for baseball,

210
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,120
<7-6,Leonard>这样我什么球赛都可以加油到
<7-6,Leonard>I didn't want to look ridiculous.

211
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,160
<7-7,Penny>这太棒了  我超喜欢的
<7-7,Penny>This is awesome. I love it!

213
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,480
<7-9,Penny>天啊  我今天累死了
<7-9,Penny>Gosh, I worked my ass off today.

214
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,080
<7-9,Penny>正好需要轻松一下
<7-9,Penny>This is exactly what I needed.

216
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:20,970
<7-10,Leonard>今晚你就是主角
<7-10,Leonard>Tonight is all about you.

217
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:22,600
<7-11,Penny>谢谢你
<7-11,Penny>Ah, thank you!

218
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:29,110
<7-12,Leonard>所以我俩之间的关系到底算是什么状况
<7-12,Leonard>So, where exactly are we in this relationship?

219
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,540
<7-13,Penny>唉  你又来了
<7-13,Penny>Oh, come on!

<7-14,Leonard>对对  我错了  看球看球
<7-14,Leonard>You're right, I'm sorry. Let's watch the game.

222
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:36,320
<7-15,Penny>对嘛
<7-15,Penny>Great.

223
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:42,490
<7-16,Leonard>但这事拖越久不谈只会变得更尴尬
<7-16,Leonard>I just know the longer we wait to talk about it, the weirder it gets.

224
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:46,200
<7-17,Penny>亲爱的  我今晚就不能做个幸福小女生吗
<7-17,Penny>Sweetie, can I just be the girl tonight?

<7-20,Leonard>我来开
<7-20,Leonard>Oh, I'll get it.

229
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:58,310
<7-20,Leonard>体育万岁

<7-23,Raj>本来是的  但这是人家周年纪念
<7-23,Raj>I was, but it's their anniversary

234
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,190
<7-23,Raj>我不想当电灯泡
<7-23,Raj>and I didn't want to be a third wheel,

235
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:10,500
<7-23,Raj>所以就想着来这儿
<7-23,Raj>so I figured I'd come over here

<7-23,Raj>参合你和佩妮的约会
<7-23,Raj>and hang out with you and Penny on your date.

237
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,400
<7-24,Leonard>现在不大方便
<7-24,Leonard>Well, it's not really a great time.

238

<7-24,Leonard>佩妮和我要谈些事情
<7-24,Leonard>Penny and I have some things we need to talk about.

241
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,550
<7-27,Leonard>难以置信  我居然为了这个把肚皮上的毛给刮了
<7-27,Leonard>I can't believe I shaved my stomach for this.

242

<8-3,Dimitri>说是你妈
<8-3,Dimitri>A woman who says she's your mother

246
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,820
<8-3,Dimitri>听像你爸
<8-3,Dimitri>but sounds like your father.

247
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,600
<8-4,Howard>妈

249
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,600
<8-4,Howard>我们其实可以看到对方的
<8-4,Howard>if you turn on the computer.

<8-5,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>我才不会接近那坨垃圾呢
<8-5,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>I'm not going near that fakakta thing.

00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:58,470
<8-6,Howard>我会感染电脑病毒的
<8-6,Howard>I'll catch a computer virus!

00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,950
<8-6,Howard>你是不会感染电脑病毒的
<8-6,Howard>You can't catch a computer virus.

253
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:07,800
<8-7,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>所以你现在既是宇航员还是医生了吗
<8-7,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>Oh, so now you're an astronaut and a doctor?

254
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,090

<8-10,Howard>Bernadette and I are starting a life together and...

258
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,150
<8-11,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>老天啊  你要弃我而去啦
<8-11,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>Oh, God! You are gonna leave me!

260
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,670
<8-12,Howard>没关系的

261
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:31,140
<8-13,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>你爸离开我  你也这样
<8-13,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>Your father left me, you left me--

262
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:34,700
<8-13,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>我就是那种别人想要抛弃的人
<8-13,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>I guess I'm just the kind of person people like to leave.

263
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,120
<8-14,Howard>这不...还没定呢
<8-14,Howard>It's not... definite.

264
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,300
<8-14,Howard>我会和伯纳黛特商量的
<8-14,Howard>I'll talk to Bernadette.

265

<8-15,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>不用你废心了
<8-15,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>Don't bother.

266
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,750
<8-15,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>我还是地上挖个坑住着
<8-15,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>I'll just go sit in a hole in the ground

267
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,930
<8-15,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>死了也省事儿
<8-15,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>so I'm no trouble when I die.

268
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:50,150
<8-16,Howard>别说了  妈
<8-16,Howard>Stop it, Ma.

269
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:53,900
<8-16,Howard>我肯定能带着小妮妮常回家看看的
<8-16,Howard>I'm sure I can get Bernie to come around.

<8-17,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>我就知道
<8-17,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>I knew it!

<8-17,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>你就不能让女人对你指手划脚
<8-17,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>you can't let a woman tell you what to do!

274
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:05,850
<8-18,Howard>好了好了
<8-18,Howard>Okay, okay.

275
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:10,290
<8-19,Dimitri>难以置信  这些人居然赢了冷战
<8-19,Dimitri>I can't believe these people won the Cold War.

276
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:15,680
<8-20,Howard>现在你能换个话题吗
<8-20,Howard>Now, can we please change the subject?

<8-21,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>我没收到过一封信
<8-21,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>and I haven't gotten a single letter.

280
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:23,020
<8-21,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>连张便宜明信片都没有
<8-21,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>Not even a lousy postcard!

281
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:31,870
<9-1,Raj>我开始越来越喜欢橄榄球了

<9-3,Raj>虽然没羽毛球或板球这么热血[印度热门运动]
<9-3,Raj>Well...it's not the balls-to-the-wall action of badminton or cricket,

284
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:37,500
<9-3,Raj>不过嘛
<9-3,Raj>but hey...

294
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,690
<9-11,Leonard>佩妮和我有些事儿需要谈谈
<9-11,Leonard>Penny and I have some issues we need to talk about.

00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,920
<9-12,Raj>屁大的事儿啊
<9-12,Raj>Pish on your issues!

296
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:05,850
<9-12,Raj>你们没问题的

<9-12,Raj>没错  你一路上是遇到了点障碍
<9-12,Raj>Yes, you hit some bumps along the way.

298
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,180
<9-12,Raj>还有  佩妮
<9-12,Raj>I mean, Penny,

299
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:12,120
<9-12,Raj>你也知道这个男人对你的感情
<9-12,Raj>you've always known how this man has felt about you,

300
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,650
<9-12,Raj>但你却总让他祈求你的关爱
<9-12,Raj>but you made him grovel for affection.

301
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:15,780
<9-13,Penny>等等
<9-13,Penny>Okay, hold on...

302
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:16,990
<9-14,Raj>别内疚
<9-14,Raj>Now, don't blame yourself.

303
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:19,290
<9-14,Raj>他从来都是祈求者
<9-14,Raj>He was a groveler from way back.

304
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,690
<9-14,Raj>但我的意思是  你们俩总要跨过去的
<9-14,Raj>But the point is, the two of you got past it.

305
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:26,490
<9-14,Raj>莱纳德  你滚床单滚一半
<9-14,Raj>And, Leonard, you go and propose

00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,680
<9-14,Raj>对这可怜的女娃求婚
<9-14,Raj>to this poor girl in the middle of sex?

307
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:30,320
<9-14,Raj>实在是弱爆了  老兄
<9-14,Raj>That was some weak tea, dude.

308
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,430
<9-15,Leonard>有些人也许会觉得浪漫呢
<9-15,Leonard>Some people might say it was romantic.

309
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:35,930
<9-16,Raj>不可能
<9-16,Raj>Yeah, no.

310
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:40,320
<9-16,Raj>但你看你俩现在还在一起
<9-16,Raj>But yet, here you two are, still together.

311
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:43,500
<9-16,Raj>甚至还是在我俩激情一裸的那晚之后
<9-16,Raj>And that's even after you and I had our crazy naked night.

312
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,750
<9-18,Penny>够了够了
<9-18,Penny>Okay... That's enough.

314
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:48,020
<9-19,Raj>在你俩同甘共苦这么久之后
<9-19,Raj>that after everything you've been through,

315
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,150
<9-19,Raj>总能互相凝望
<9-19,Raj>you get to look into each other's eyes

316
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:52,820
<9-19,Raj>说声"我爱你"
<9-19,Raj>and say "I love you."

317
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,850
<9-19,Raj>这是多么的美好
<9-19,Raj>And that's beautiful.

318
00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:00,900
<9-20,Leonard>事实上到现在为止她还没说过
<9-20,Leonard>Actually, to this day, she's never really said it.

319
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:04,370
<9-21,Raj>佩妮  这太荒谬了
<9-21,Raj>Oh, Penny! That's ridiculous!

<9-21,Raj>你心里知道你爱她的
<9-21,Raj>You know you love him!

321
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:07,920
<9-21,Raj>你看着他的眼睛然后说出来
<9-21,Raj>You look him in the eyes and you say it.

<9-22,Penny>-拉杰  -别这样

348
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:45,440
<11-14,Sheldon>当我看着你的双眼

349
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,650
<11-14,Sheldon>而你也深情看着我时

350
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:51,540
<11-14,Sheldon>一切都好像变得特别了
<11-14,Sheldon>everything feels not quite normal,

351
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:54,070
<11-14,Sheldon>因为我
<11-14,Sheldon>because I feel

352
