1
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:04,530
<1-1,Leonard>之前跟你约会的那女的怎么样了
<1-1,Leonard>What's going on with that woman you're dating?

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:05,710
<1-2,Raj>我甩了她
<1-2,Raj>I broke up with her.

3
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:06,480
<1-3,Leonard>为什么
<1-3,Leonard>Why?

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,140
<1-4,Raj>因为她说她再也不想见到我
<1-4,Raj>She said she didn't want to see me anymore

5
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,300
<1-4,Raj>我觉得这话太侮辱人了
<1-4,Raj>and I found that insulting.

6
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:13,480
<1-5,Howard>我还以为你们发展不错呢  怎么了
<1-5,Howard>I thought things were going well. What happened?

7
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,940
<1-6,Raj>我也不知道  她甚至没告诉我原因
<1-6,Raj>I don't know, she didn't even give me a reason.

8
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:17,850
<1-7,Sheldon>小事一桩  我们可以一起推算
<1-7,Sheldon>Oh, not a problem, we can figure this out.

9
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,450
<1-7,Sheldon>女人拒绝拉杰的原因有哪些呢
<1-7,Sheldon>What are the reasons women reject Raj?

10
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:24,830
<1-8,Raj>求不玩这个游戏
<1-8,Raj>Can we not play this game?

11
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:27,360
<1-9,Sheldon>不爱玩游戏  这就算一个
<1-9,Sheldon>Doesn't like games. That's one.

12
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:29,670
<1-10,Leonard>别理他
<1-10,Leonard>Ignore him.

13
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,140
<1-10,Leonard>分手了你也别太难过
<1-10,Leonard>Yeah, sorry about the breakup.

14
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,310
<1-11,Raj>没关系  我没事
<1-11,Raj>That's okay, I'm fine.

15
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:33,600
<1-11,Raj>你当然没事啦
<1-11,Raj>Of course you're fine.

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,420
<1-12,Sheldon>一个物种里  本就不是全部都能找到伴
<1-12,Sheldon>Not every member of a species finds a mate.

17
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,400
<1-12,Sheldon>艾萨克·牛顿爵士到死都还是处男
<1-12,Sheldon>Sir Isaac Newton died a virgin.

18
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,670
<1-12,Sheldon>你看看他对人类的贡献有多大
<1-12,Sheldon>Look at the contributions he made.

19
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,240
<1-13,Raj>谢尔顿  我不是处男
<1-13,Raj>I'm not a virgin, Sheldon.

20
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,740
<1-14,Sheldon>怎么  你觉得自己比艾萨克·牛顿还牛逼了吗
<1-14,Sheldon>Wha... So now you think you're better than Isaac Newton?

21
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:49,710
<1-14,Sheldon>难怪女人都不喜欢你
<1-14,Sheldon>No wonder women don't like you.

22
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,150
<1-15,Leonard>你这样太损了
<1-15,Leonard>You're not being very nice.

23
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:53,550
<1-16,Sheldon>哪有  他自己说他没事
<1-16,Sheldon>What? He said he was fine.

24
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:56,150
<1-17,Howard>有时人们所言非所想
<1-17,Howard>Sometimes people say things they don't mean.

25
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:57,680
<1-18,Sheldon>这是个悖论
<1-18,Sheldon>Oh, that's a paradox.

26
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,320
<1-18,Sheldon>如果你刚才的所言即所想
<1-18,Sheldon>I-If you meant what you just said,

27
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,500
<1-18,Sheldon>那就意味着你刚才所言可能非所想
<1-18,Sheldon>then that means you may not have meant what you just said.

28
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,290
<1-19,Leonard>小心点  我在《星际迷航》看过这幕
<1-19,Leonard>Careful, I saw this on Star Trek.

29
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:06,960
<1-19,Leonard>很快他耳朵要冒出蒸汽了
<1-19,Leonard>Smoke's gonna come out of his ears soon.

30
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:10,040
<1-20,Penny>小伙子们  你们好吗
<1-20,Penny>Hey, boys. How's it going?

31
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,990
<1-21,Sheldon>我本以为我们大家在愉悦地交流
<1-21,Sheldon>Well, I thought we were having a nice conversation,

32
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:14,680
<1-21,Sheldon>结果发现  原来我是在冒犯人
<1-21,Sheldon>but it turns out, I was being offensive.

33
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,690
<1-22,Bernadette>-一如既往  -对...
<1-22,Bernadette>- So, normal. - Yeah--

34
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:18,900
<1-24,Amy>谢尔顿  你又干嘛了
<1-24,Amy>?Sheldon, what did you do?

35
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,100
<1-25,Sheldon>我们在讨论拉杰最近分手的事
<1-25,Sheldon>We were discussing Raj's recent breakup

36
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,310
<1-25,Sheldon>显然是我没顾虑到他心情
<1-25,Sheldon>and apparently, I was insensitive to him.

37
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,150
<1-26,Raj>没关系  我没事
<1-26,Raj>It's okay, I'm fine.

38
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:26,640
<1-27,Sheldon>你有事  别中了他的计
<1-27,Sheldon>You di-- Don't fall for it.

39
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,490
<1-27,Sheldon>他会诱拐你把他跟死去的处男做对比
<1-27,Sheldon>He'll get you to compare him to a dead virgin,

40
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:30,830
<1-27,Sheldon>然后突然间你就成了坏人
<1-27,Sheldon>and suddenly you're the bad guy.

41
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,750
<1-28,Raj>谢尔顿  我说我没事时
<1-28,Raj>Sheldon, when I said I was fine,

42
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,910
<1-28,Raj>我的意思是我不想再谈这件事了
<1-28,Raj>I meant I didn't want to talk about it anymore.

43
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:37,390
<1-29,Sheldon>那你为什么不直接这么说
<1-29,Sheldon>Then why didn't you say that?

44
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:38,960
<1-30,Howard>因为大家都不这么说
<1-30,Howard>Because that's not what people do.

45
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,400
<1-31,Sheldon>我宁愿大家直接告诉我
<1-31,Sheldon>Well, I would prefer if people told me

46
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,100
<1-31,Sheldon>他们心中真实的想法
<1-31,Sheldon>exactly what is on their mind.

47
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,420
<1-32,Penny>不  不会  你不会  你不会想要
<1-32,Penny>No. No, you don't, you really don't.

48
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,870
<1-32,Penny>我再强调几百遍都不够
<1-32,Penny>I actually can't say "Don't" enough.

49
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:48,430
<1-33,Sheldon>这至少会让相处简单很多啊
<1-33,Sheldon>Well, it certainly would be easier.

50
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:50,240
<1-33,Sheldon>你们压根就不会懂
<1-33,Sheldon>You have no idea what it's like

51
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,230
<1-33,Sheldon>读不懂别人情绪的复杂心情
<1-33,Sheldon>to struggle with recognizing emotional cues.

52
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:55,100
<1-34,Amy>想必是非常烦心吧
<1-34,Amy>I'm sure it's extremely frustrating.

53
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,050
<1-36,Amy>-是的  谢谢  -还有点小伤心吧
<1-36,Amy>- Thank you. - And also a little sad.

54
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,660
<1-37,Sheldon>够了  你现在就是在显摆你会读
<1-37,Sheldon>O-Okay, now you're just showing off.

55
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,810
<1-38,Bernadette>我听说麻省理工有个团队
<1-38,Bernadette>You know, I just read that a team at MIT

56
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:05,730
<1-38,Bernadette>制造出了一种可协助解读人类情绪的装置
<1-38,Bernadette>developed a device that helps people read human emotions.

57
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:06,960
<1-39,Leonard>你觉得我们能让他们
<1-39,Leonard>And you think we can get those guys

58
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,890
<1-39,Leonard>给谢尔顿重新编程吗  酷啊
<1-39,Leonard>to reprogram Sheldon? Cool.

59
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:13,360
<1-40,Bernadette>该装置的准确率好像能到85%呢
<1-40,Bernadette>It's supposed to be accurate, like, 85% of the time.

60
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,940
<1-41,Penny>我觉得有点难以置信
<1-41,Penny>Wow, I find that hard to believe.

61
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,800
<1-42,Leonard>你不敢相信一群害羞内向
<1-42,Leonard>That a bunch of awkward scientists

62
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,030
<1-42,Leonard>零社交技能的科学家会发明这种机器
<1-42,Leonard>with no social skills would invent a machine

63
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,310
<1-42,Leonard>来帮助他们读懂他人情绪吗
<1-42,Leonard>to do it for them?

64
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,280
<1-43,Penny>我收回我的话  我相信
<1-43,Penny>I take it back. I believe it.

65
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,590
<1-44,Howard>如果麻省理工有的话  我可以打电话问问啊
<1-44,Howard>You know, if it's at MIT, I can make some calls.

66
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,900
<1-44,Howard>或许可以帮谢尔顿搞个原型机来
<1-44,Howard>Maybe we can get Sheldon a prototype.

67
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,450
<1-45,Amy>你觉得如何
<1-45,Amy>What do you think?

68
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,760
<1-46,Sheldon>能读懂情绪的机器的确挺吸引人
<1-46,Sheldon>A machine that reads emotions is intriguing.

69
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,720
<1-46,Sheldon>它能帮我成为一个更体贴的朋友
<1-46,Sheldon>It could help me be a more considerate friend.

70
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,170
<1-47,Bernadette>那何尝不是件好事
<1-47,Bernadette>Wouldn't that be nice.

71
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:38,870
<1-48,Sheldon>还可以帮助我找出我的敌人
<1-48,Sheldon>It could also help me identify my enemies,

72
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:41,390
<1-48,Sheldon>发现他们的恐惧  然后...
<1-48,Sheldon>discover their fears and then...

73
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,210
<1-48,Sheldon>我就能利用他们的恐惧来摧毁他们
<1-48,Sheldon>I could use those fears to destroy them.

74
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,340
<1-49,Bernadette>我喜欢第一种用法
<1-49,Bernadette>I like the first one.

75
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:53,810
<1-49,Bernadette>字幕组
<1-49,Bernadette>ZiMuZu.tv

88
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,580
<2-1,Raj>现在谢尔顿搬到对面住了
<2-1,Raj>Now that Sheldon's across the hall,

89
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,900
<2-1,Raj>你决定好了要把他就房间拿来干嘛吗
<2-1,Raj>have you decided what you're doing with his old room?

90
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,960
<2-2,Leonard>我在想看是改成小藏书室或是游戏房
<2-2,Leonard>I was thinking maybe a library or a gaming room.

91
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,950
<2-3,Sheldon>也可以改成火车玩具房啊
<2-3,Sheldon>You could make it a train room.

92
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,370
<2-4,Leonard>我不喜欢火车  喜欢火车的是你
<2-4,Leonard>I don't like trains. You like trains.

93
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:28,620
<2-5,Sheldon>我知道  可是艾米不让我弄个火车玩具房
<2-5,Sheldon>I know, and Amy says I can't have a train room.

94
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,100
<2-6,Howard>谢尔顿  麻省理工的人回复我了
<2-6,Howard>Sheldon, I just heard from the guys at MIT

95
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,180
<2-6,Howard>那个情绪解读机  他们会送个原型机过来
<2-6,Howard>about that emotion reader; they're sending a prototype

96
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,410
<2-6,Howard>让你做发行前测试
<2-6,Howard>for you to beta test.

97
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:37,070
<2-7,Sheldon>太好了
<2-7,Sheldon>Wonderful.

98
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:38,280
<2-7,Sheldon>虽然我也不知道对成为
<2-7,Sheldon>Although I'm not sure how I feel

99
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,120
<2-7,Sheldon>实验天竺鼠该作何感想
<2-7,Sheldon>about being used as a guinea pig.

100
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,470
<2-8,Leonard>等你拿到机器  你就知道该作何感想啦
<2-8,Leonard>Well, when you get the machine, you can find out.

101
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,720
<2-9,Raj>或许我可以拿来
<2-9,Raj>Maybe I could use it

102
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,830
<2-9,Raj>看看为什么女人不停甩我
<2-9,Raj>to understand why women keep dumping me.

103
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:50,450
<2-10,Howard>你不需要用机器啊  你就发意见调查表
<2-10,Howard>Oh, you don't need a machine for that, just send a survey card

104
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:51,790
<2-10,Howard>给你所有的前女友  再告诉她们
<2-10,Howard>to all your ex-girlfriends and tell them

105
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:54,310
<2-10,Howard>填表的人有机会中奖就行了
<2-10,Howard>if they fill it out they might win a prize.

106
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,390
<2-11,Raj>这主意还不赖啊
<2-11,Raj>That's actually not a bad idea.

107
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:58,190
<2-11,Raj>或许我可以让她们齐聚一堂
<2-11,Raj>Maybe I could even get them all together,

108
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:00,180
<2-11,Raj>弄成像焦点小组
<2-11,Raj>sort of like a... a focus group,

109
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,570
<2-11,Raj>来探讨出我到底是哪里有问题
<2-11,Raj>to find out what's wrong with me.

110
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:04,260
<2-12,Leonard>别啊  拉杰  这是个馊主意
<2-12,Leonard>No, Raj, that's a terrible idea.

111
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,120
<2-13,Howard>对啊  我刚才在瞎说
<2-13,Howard>Yeah, I was joking.

112
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,430
<2-13,Howard>你们...  真的吗
<2-13,Howard>You... Really?

113
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:09,310
<2-14,Sheldon>小秘诀  笑话结尾通常用
<2-14,Sheldon>Uh, little tip: jokes are often better

114
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:13,160
<2-14,Sheldon>"哇咔哇咔"或者是"哈恰恰"比较好
<2-14,Sheldon>when you end them with "Wocka Wocka" or "Ha-cha-cha."

115
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:13,160
<2-14,Sheldon>分别是电视节目《大青蛙布偶秀》中角色
<2-14,Sheldon>与知名美国单口相声演员吉米·杜兰特的招牌语

116
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:18,290
<3-1,Leonard>好消息  我想买的大电视放得进游戏房
<3-1,Leonard>Hey, great news. The TV I want will fit in the gaming room,

117
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:19,720
<3-1,Leonard>而且如果我不拉上窗帘
<3-1,Leonard>and if I leave the curtains open,

118
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,900
<3-1,Leonard>我工作时都能看得到
<3-1,Leonard>I can watch it from work.

119
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,680
<3-2,Penny>你能缓一缓改装那房间的事吗
<3-2,Penny>Hey, can you hold off redoing the room?

120
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,720
<3-2,Penny>我哥过几周会来这里
<3-2,Penny>My brother's coming out here in a few weeks.

121
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,170
<3-3,Leonard>行啊  没问题  你哥哥怎么了
<3-3,Leonard>Oh. Yeah. Okay, sure. What's going on with your brother?

122
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:32,040
<3-4,Penny>我爸让我帮忙把他弄进我们公司面试
<3-4,Penny>My dad asked if I can get him a job interview at my work.

123
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,600
<3-5,Leonard>你确定这是个好主意吗
<3-5,Leonard>Is that a good idea?

124
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,440
<3-5,Leonard>你觉得他们会愿意让
<3-5,Leonard>I mean, you think they'll consider someone

125
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,260
<3-5,Leonard>坐过牢的人去卖药丸吗
<3-5,Leonard>who was in prison for selling drugs?

126
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,440
<3-6,Penny>我卖的是药品
<3-6,Penny>Well, I sell pharmaceuticals.

127
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,870
<3-6,Penny>是药丸的高档版
<3-6,Penny>That's just a really hard to spell word for drugs.

<4-2,Amy>机器可以做到这点  太厉害了

<4-5,Amy>这台机器能否准确识别
<4-5,Amy>if the machine can identify them accurately.

155
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,630

00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:48,570
<4-6,Howard>"我这辈子都干了些啥啊"

<4-10,Sheldon>有人无视了它们小小尖尖的牙齿
<4-10,Sheldon>Somebody's ignoring their tiny needle teeth,

<6-4,Sheldon>no need to clap your hands,

199
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:32,550

<6-10,Penny>to help him get a job out here.

208
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:50,300
<6-11,Sheldon>这令莱纳德生气了
<6-11,Sheldon>And that makes Leonard angry.

<6-13,Sheldon>手机上这个红色皱眉的家伙代表生气
<6-13,Sheldon>It's this red frowny guy on my phone.

217
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:14,610
<6-20,Leonard>你邀请你的毒贩哥哥来和我们一起住
<6-20,Leonard>You invited your drug dealer brother to stay with us

218
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:17,780
<6-20,Leonard>天知道住多长时间  却事先根本没问过我
<6-20,Leonard>for God knows how long and didn't bother to ask me first.

219
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:18,560
<6-21,Penny>他是我哥
<6-21,Penny>He's my brother!

220
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,210
<6-21,Penny>我不觉得我需要你的允许
<6-21,Penny>I didn't think I needed your permission.

221
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:22,580
<6-22,Sheldon>瞧  现在她也生气了
<6-22,Sheldon>Well, hey. Now she's angry, too.

222
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,170
<6-22,Sheldon>这东西太牛逼了
<6-22,Sheldon>This thing works like gangbusters.

223
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:31,200
<6-23,Leonard>我不是说你必须得到我的允许
<6-23,Leonard>I'm not saying you have to ask my permission,

224
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,400
<6-23,Leonard>但你在答应前
<6-23,Leonard>but you could have talked to me about it

225
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,810
<6-23,Leonard>好歹知会我一声吧
<6-23,Leonard>before you said it was okay.

226
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:35,890
<6-24,Penny>像你知会我  你的游戏室那样吗
<6-24,Penny>Like you talked to me about your gaming room?

227
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,010
<6-25,Leonard>我们的游戏室
<6-25,Leonard>Our gaming room!

228
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:39,720
<6-25,Leonard>我还打算往里摆一个香薰蜡烛呢
<6-25,Leonard>I was gonna put a scented candle in it.

229
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:42,300
<6-26,Sheldon>他还在生气
<6-26,Sheldon>He's still mad.

230
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,580
<6-27,Amy>别幸灾乐祸
<6-27,Amy>Stop enjoying their fight.

231
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:47,020
<6-28,Sheldon>你好意思说我
<6-28,Sheldon>You first.

232
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,050
<6-29,Penny>如果你这么不高兴
<6-29,Penny>If you were this upset,

233
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:50,930
<6-29,Penny>我告诉你时  你为什么不说
<6-29,Penny>why didn't you say so when I told you?

234
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,810
<6-30,Leonard>因为我不想表现得像混蛋一样
<6-30,Leonard>Because I didn't want to sound like a jerk.

235
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:54,750
<6-31,Penny>你现在就是个混蛋  我不觉得
<6-31,Penny>Well, you sound like one now. I don't see the big deal

236
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,850
<6-31,Penny>我哥来住一段时间有什么大不了的
<6-31,Penny>if my brother comes and stays for a while.

237
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:58,860
<6-32,Leonard>如果你帮他找到工作  他会永远住在这里
<6-32,Leonard>If you get him a job, he's gonna live here forever!

238
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,450
<6-33,Penny>他会自己找住处
<6-33,Penny>He would get his own place.

239
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:01,950
<6-34,Leonard>他这辈子有过自己的住处吗
<6-34,Leonard>Has he ever had his own place?

240
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:02,720
<6-35,Penny>有过
<6-35,Penny>Yes!

241
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,990
<6-36,Leonard>床边就是金属马桶吗[牢房]
<6-36,Leonard>Did it have a metal toilet next to the bed?

242
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:08,400
<6-37,Penny>那...也算啊
<6-37,Penny>It still counts.

243
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,110
<6-37,Penny>这和你逼我与谢尔顿一起住
<6-37,Penny>You know, how is this any different

244
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,860
<6-37,Penny>有什么区别
<6-37,Penny>from you making me live with Sheldon?

245
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,060
<6-37,Penny>你...太伤人了
<6-37,Penny>You... Hey!

248
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,700
<6-40,Leonard>别在这里瞎掺和
<6-40,Leonard>Stay out of this.

249
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,090
<6-40,Leonard>这事就是你和你那台烂机器挑起来的
<6-40,Leonard>You and your stupid machine started this fight!

250
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:26,850
<6-41,Sheldon>你该庆幸这台情感机器
<6-41,Sheldon>You are lucky that this feelings machine

251
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:29,030
<6-41,Sheldon>不具备任何情感
<6-41,Sheldon>doesn't have feelings.

<6-43,Sheldon>乐意至极  我们可以摔门而去吗
<6-43,Sheldon>Gladly. Can we storm out?

254
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:36,020
<6-44,Amy>你说出来就失去了震撼效果了
<6-44,Amy>I think it loses its impact if we're chatting about it.

255
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:36,610
<6-44,Amy>好吧
<6-44,Amy>Fine.

256

<6-45,Sheldon>那我就对他们比那根手指吧
<6-45,Sheldon>I'll just give them the finger.

263
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:00,350

276
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,500
<7-6,Lucy>我患有严重的社会焦虑症
<7-6,Lucy>because I have severe social anxiety,

277
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,660

<7-6,Lucy>and he kept trying to force me

278
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,070
<7-6,Lucy>非常尴尬的境地
<7-6,Lucy>into uncomfortable situations.

282
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,430
<7-9,Raj>我有时对别人的底线不太敏感
<7-9,Raj>I can be insensitive to other people's boundaries.

<7-9,Raj>霍华德  你能帮我记下来吗

<7-12,Claire>And I guess I broke up with you

290
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:58,980
<7-12,Claire>主要是你太黏人了
<7-12,Claire>because you were just really needy.

291
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,820
<7-12,Claire>而且你还非常虚荣
<7-12,Claire>Also, you were incredibly vain--

292
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:01,860
<7-12,Claire>比如你花了好多时间
<7-12,Claire>like, all the time you spent

293

<7-12,Claire>修你的眉型...

297
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,010
<7-14,Emily>在霍华德面前说出我们交往的细节
<7-14,Emily>sharing details about our relationship in front of Howard.

298
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,420
<7-15,Raj>他是来支持我的  你什么都可以
<7-15,Raj>He's here to support me, so anything you have to say

299
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,980
<7-15,Raj>在他面前说
<7-15,Raj>you can say in front of him.

300
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,840
<7-16,Emily>好吧  每次我俩上床时...
<7-16,Emily>Okay. Well, whenever you and I were in bed...

00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,140
<7-17,Raj>霍华德  滚出去

302
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,790
<7-18,Howard>门都没有
<7-18,Howard>Not a chance.

303
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,990
<7-18,Howard>刚才你说到拉杰床上功夫相当烂
<7-18,Howard>So, you were telling us how Raj was terrible in bed.

304
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:34,520
<8-1,Amy>谢尔顿  晚饭做好了
<8-1,Amy>Sheldon, dinner's ready.

305
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,470
<8-1,Amy>我做了牛肉糜卷  因为我知道
<8-1,Amy>I made beef loaf, because I know you're uncomfortable

306
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:39,450
<8-1,Amy>你不喜欢菜名含糊的肉糜卷
<8-1,Amy>with the non-specificity of meat loaf.

307
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:42,140
<8-1,Amy>谢尔顿
<8-1,Amy>Sheldon?

308
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:48,050
<8-1,Amy>你没事吧
<8-1,Amy>Hey, are you okay?

309
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:49,500
<8-2,Sheldon>人家很不好
<8-2,Sheldon>Not really.

310
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,780
<8-3,Amy>你怎么了
<8-3,Amy>What's going on?

311
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:53,250
<8-4,Sheldon>我真希望自己没用过那机器
<8-4,Sheldon>I wish I never tried that device.

312
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,470
<8-4,Sheldon>我知道上次用过按摩椅后  我也说了同样的话
<8-4,Sheldon>And I know I said the same thing after the massage chair,

313
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:57,740
<8-4,Sheldon>但这次我是认真的
<8-4,Sheldon>but this time I mean it.

314
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:01,610
<8-5,Amy>我很抱歉莱纳德和佩妮伤害了你的感情
<8-5,Amy>I'm sorry Leonard and Penny hurt your feelings.

315
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:03,210
<8-6,Sheldon>比那个严重多了
<8-6,Sheldon>It's more than that.

316
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:04,720
<8-6,Sheldon>是我的问题
<8-6,Sheldon>It's me.

317
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,490
<8-6,Sheldon>我一直都知道
<8-6,Sheldon>I always knew

318
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:07,820
<8-6,Sheldon>自己在解读别人情绪方面有困难
<8-6,Sheldon>I had trouble recognizing other people's emotions,

319
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:11,610
<8-6,Sheldon>但机器把这个问题凸显了出来
<8-6,Sheldon>but that machine just made it so real.

320
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:14,430
<8-7,Amy>每个人都有需要帮助的问题
<8-7,Amy>Well, everybody has things that they need help with.

321
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:17,000
<8-7,Amy>比如我  我摘了眼镜就看不清楚
<8-7,Amy>Like me-- I can't see without my glasses.

322
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,610
<8-7,Amy>现在我看你就是一个可爱的粉团子
<8-7,Amy>And right now you're just a, a cute, pink smudge wearing

323
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:22,270
<8-7,Amy>裹着一身孩子气的绿团子
<8-7,Amy>a childish green smudge.

324
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:26,410
<8-8,Sheldon>我以为自己有所改善了  结果并没有
<8-8,Sheldon>I thought I was getting better at it, but clearly I'm not.

325
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,050
<8-9,Amy>你改善很多了
<8-9,Amy>Yes, you are.

326
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:30,220
<8-9,Amy>好几次我不开心时
<8-9,Amy>There have definitely been days

327
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,610
<8-9,Amy>你都看出来了
<8-9,Amy>when I was sad and you could tell.

328
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:34,880
<8-10,Sheldon>但那就像是瓮中捉鳖  手到擒来
<8-10,Sheldon>Yeah, but that's shooting fish in a barrel.

329
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,300
<8-10,Sheldon>你本身就是个悲伤聚合体
<8-10,Sheldon>You're kind of a sad sack.

330
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,270
<8-10,Sheldon>抱歉  我不该怎么说
<8-10,Sheldon>I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that.

331
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:43,100
<8-10,Sheldon>我只是很难过
<8-10,Sheldon>I'm just upset.

332
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,650
<8-11,Amy>不  你看
<8-11,Amy>No, see, right there,

333
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:46,450
<8-11,Amy>你能觉察到你伤了我的心
<8-11,Amy>you knew you hurt my feelings.

334
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:48,020
<8-11,Amy>我真为你骄傲
<8-11,Amy>And I'm proud of you--

335
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:51,850
<8-11,Amy>我之所以老悲伤肯定是受我爸影响
<8-11,Amy>for reasons I'm sure have something to do with my father.

336
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,010
<8-11,Amy>如果你不喜欢那台机器
<8-11,Amy>And if you don't like

337
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:57,080
<8-11,Amy>就不要用了
<8-11,Amy>that machine, get rid of it.

338
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:00,530
<8-11,Amy>因为我爱的就是原来的你
<8-11,Amy>Because I love you exactly the way you are.

339
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:10,330
<8-12,Sheldon>我对你也是这种感觉
<8-12,Sheldon>I feel the same way about you.

340
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:13,080
<8-12,Sheldon>现在把你的眼镜带上
<8-12,Sheldon>Now, put your glasses back on.

341
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,830
<8-12,Sheldon>你看起来怪怪的
<8-12,Sheldon>You look weird.

342
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:20,730
<9-1,Howard (translating for other Emily)>我觉得你很好
<9-1,Howard (translating for other Emily)>I thought you were great,

343
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:22,750
<9-1,Howard (translating for other Emily)>但是  我的妈呀
<9-1,Howard (translating for other Emily)>but, oh, my God, you were

344
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:25,240
<9-1,Howard (translating for other Emily)>你被你父母控制得太多了
<9-1,Howard (translating for other Emily)>so dominated by your parents.

345
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,910
<9-2,Emily>没错  这点经常让我抓狂
<9-2,Emily>Oh, yeah, and that used to drive me nuts.

346
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,560
<9-2,Emily>他这人有点妈宝男
<9-2,Emily>He's kind of a mama's boy.

347
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,440
<9-3,Claire>-岂止有一点  -好了
<9-3,Claire>- Kind of? - Whoa, okay!

348
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,280
<9-4,Raj>够了
<9-4,Raj>That's enough.

349
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,240
<9-4,Raj>你就写"惹人爱的好儿子"
<9-4,Raj>Write down "Loving son."

350
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:37,570
<9-5,Lucy>我可以说两句吗
<9-5,Lucy>Can I just say something?

351
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:39,090
<9-5,Lucy>和拉杰交往
<9-5,Lucy>Going out with Raj

352
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:41,680
<9-5,Lucy>是我遇到的最幸运的事
<9-5,Lucy>was one of the best things that ever happened to me.

353
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,160
<9-6,Raj>很好  我愿意和你复合
<9-6,Raj>Yes, I'll take you back.

354
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,610
<9-7,Lucy>让我说完
<9-7,Lucy>Let me finish.

355
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:51,100
<9-7,Lucy>感觉就像因为跟他交往了之后
<9-7,Lucy>It's like I needed to go through that experience

356
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:54,990
<9-7,Lucy>我才知道我不想要什么样的男人
<9-7,Lucy>to know what exactly I don't want in a man.

357
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:58,160
<9-8,Raj>这话真伤人  不过我还是愿意和你复合
<9-8,Raj>Well, that's hard to hear, but I'll still take you back.

358
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:01,380
<9-9,Emily>我也有这种感觉
<9-9,Emily>You know, the same thing happened to me.

359
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,830
<9-9,Emily>我和拉杰分手后  我遇到了盖瑞
<9-9,Emily>After I broke up with Raj, I met Gary,

360
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:05,500
<9-9,Emily>他简直太棒了
<9-9,Emily>who's just amazing.

361
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,190
<9-10,Howard>打扰下  拼写是一个R还是两个
<9-10,Howard>Sorry, is that "Gary" with one R or two?

362
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:09,420
<9-11,Raj>别写了好吗
<9-11,Raj>Would you stop writing?!

363
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:12,320
<9-11,Raj>慢着  你们所有人
<9-11,Raj>Just wait. So... did all of you

364

<9-11,Raj>在和我分手后  都有了更美好的恋情吗
<9-11,Raj>go on to better relationships after me?

365
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,130
<9-12,Lucy>是的
<9-12,Lucy>Oh, yeah.

366
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:15,970
<9-13,Emily>毫无疑问
<9-13,Emily>Without question.

367
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:18,400
<9-14,Claire>我是在分手前就有了
<9-14,Claire>Little before, actually.

368
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,700
<9-15,Howard (responding to other Emily)>你可得牢牢抓住他
<9-15,Howard (responding to other Emily)>Don't let him get away.

369
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,470
<9-16,Raj>慢着  她说什么
<9-16,Raj>Wait. What did she say?

370
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:29,430
<9-17,Howard>可以这样说  甩了你
<9-17,Howard>Uh, basically, she traded you

371
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:31,610
<9-17,Howard>换来个蝙蝠侠
<9-17,Howard>for Bruce Wayne.

372
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,580
<9-18,Raj>我们还是到此结束吧
<9-18,Raj>Okay, maybe we should just end this.

373
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,230
<9-19,Howard>慢着
<9-19,Howard>Wait, hang on.

374

<9-19,Howard>我想为在座各位指出
<9-19,Howard>I just want to point out to everyone here,

375
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:42,980
<9-19,Howard>这个男人竭尽全力
<9-19,Howard>this is a man who is going to great lengths

376
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,820
<9-19,Howard>想让自己更优秀
<9-19,Howard>to better himself.

377
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,340
<9-19,Howard>甚至冒着
<9-19,Howard>Even at the risk of...

378
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,760
<9-19,Howard>被羞辱的风险
<9-19,Howard>being humiliated.

379
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,750
<9-19,Howard>至少我觉得这样做很勇敢
<9-19,Howard>And I, for one, think that's very brave.

380
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,150
<9-20,Raj>谢谢你  霍华德
<9-20,Raj>Thank you, Howard.

381
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:56,120
<9-21,Emily>说实话  我很意外你俩没有开花结果
<9-21,Emily>Honestly, I'm surprised you two didn't wind up together.

382
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:01,400
<9-22,Howard>和你们一样  我得先经历他这场风雨
<9-22,Howard>Well, like you gals, I had to suffer through him

383
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,520
<9-22,Howard>才能找到我老婆这道彩虹
<9-22,Howard>to find Bernadette.

384
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:06,180
<9-22,Howard>偶也希望速你啊
<9-22,Howard>Wish it were you.

385
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,570
<10-1,Sheldon>什么事

386
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:12,780
<10-2,Leonard>我们应该向你道歉
<10-2,Leonard>We owe you an apology.

387
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:15,210
<10-3,Sheldon>没事啦  你需要手提箱
<10-3,Sheldon>Oh, it's fine. You needed a suitcase,

<10-3,Sheldon>我不在家  你就借走个手提箱嘛
<10-3,Sheldon>I wasn't home, you borrowed a suitcase.

389
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:21,040
<10-4,Leonard>那是六年前的事了  我说的是今晚
<10-4,Leonard>That was six years ago. I'm talking about tonight.

390
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,400
<10-5,Sheldon>我以为按时间先后顺序来道歉
<10-5,Sheldon>Well, I thought we were going in order.

391
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:28,200
<10-6,Penny>我俩之间刚好世界大战爆发
<10-6,Penny>Look, we got really angry at each other,

392
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,800
<10-6,Penny>而你正好撞上了
<10-6,Penny>and you just got caught in the middle of it.

393
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,500
<10-6,Penny>还有
<10-6,Penny>And...

<10-8,Sheldon>Yeah, well, you should be.

396
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:34,040
<10-8,Sheldon>里面还有你的袜子
<10-8,Sheldon>Your socks were still in it.

397
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,010
<10-8,Sheldon>我只能扔了
<10-8,Sheldon>I had to throw it away.

398
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:37,250
<10-8,Sheldon>总之
<10-8,Sheldon>Anyway,

399
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,600
<10-8,Sheldon>我相信你们已经解决了矛盾
<10-8,Sheldon>I, uh, trust that you've resolved your conflict.

<10-10,Leonard>佩妮会打电话给她爸爸说
<10-10,Leonard>Mm, Penny's gonna call her dad and tell him it's not

402
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,880
<10-10,Leonard>他哥现在来时机不太好
<10-10,Leonard>a good time for Randall to visit.

403
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,010
<10-11,Penny>只希望他不会生气
<10-11,Penny>Hopefully, he won't be too upset.

404
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:48,430
<10-12,Leonard>你是他的小棉袄  他哪能气你多久
<10-12,Leonard>Oh, you're his little girl-- he can't stay mad at you.

405
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:49,690
<10-13,Penny>他当然不会生我的气
<10-13,Penny>He won't be mad at me.

406
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:52,170
<10-13,Penny>是你不想让我哥来  所以...
<10-13,Penny>I mean, you're the one who doesn't want my brother to come, so...

407
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:55,750
<10-14,Leonard>所以你想让我背黑锅吗
<10-14,Leonard>So you're gonna throw me under the bus?

408
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,250
<10-15,Penny>我会让你背个大大的黑锅
<10-15,Penny>Oh, I'm gonna throw you so hard,

409
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:00,390
<10-15,Penny>那锅大到可以给全村做饭了
<10-15,Penny>I might actually win a stuffed animal.

410
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,760
<10-16,Sheldon>两位  听起来你们又生气了
<10-16,Sheldon>Uh, guys, it sounds like you're getting angry again.

411
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,840
<10-17,Leonard>那是因为这是事实
<10-17,Leonard>That's because we are.

412
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,880
<10-17,Leonard>太好了
<10-17,Leonard>Yes!

413
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,340
<10-18,Sheldon>我不需要情绪解读机
<10-18,Sheldon>I don't need an emotion machine!

414
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:11,090
<10-18,Sheldon>我就是情绪解读机
<10-18,Sheldon>I am one!

415
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,720
<11-1,Howard>多谢了  女士们  太有意思了
<11-1,Howard>Thanks, ladies! This was fun!

<11-1,Howard>下次的诡异尴尬夜  别让我们期待太久哦
<11-1,Howard>Let's not wait so long for another bizarre, awkward night.

417
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,290
<11-2,Raj>真是浪费时间
<11-2,Raj>Well, that was a waste of time.

418
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:24,600
<11-2,Raj>我真是白痴
<11-2,Raj>I'm such an idiot.

419
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,700
<11-3,Howard>别这么自责
<11-3,Howard>Don't beat yourself up.

420
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,760
<11-3,Howard>批评你是我的工作
<11-3,Howard>That's what I'm here for.

421
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:28,940
<11-4,Raj>也许我不该定下来
<11-4,Raj>Maybe I won't settle down.

422
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,790
<11-4,Raj>也许我要在花丛中过一过
<11-4,Raj>Maybe I'll just play the field.

423
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,190
<11-5,Howard>花丛刚才就在这屋里
<11-5,Howard>Yeah, the field was just here.

424
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:34,270
<11-5,Howard>花丛拒绝了
<11-5,Howard>The field said no.

425
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,540
<11-6,Raj>兄弟  拜托
<11-6,Raj>Dude, come on.

426
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,510
<11-7,Howard>这样吧
<11-7,Howard>Okay, I'll tell you what.

427
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:40,170
<11-7,Howard>我们约好
<11-7,Howard>I'll make you a deal.

428
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:42,370
<11-7,Howard>三十年后  如何你依然单身
<11-7,Howard>30 years from now, if you're still single

429
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:44,880
<11-7,Howard>而我和伯纳黛特也离婚了
<11-7,Howard>and things don't work out with me and Bernadette...

430
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,250
<11-7,Howard>咱俩可以试试
<11-7,Howard>you and I can give it a go.

431
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,280
<11-8,Raj>感谢你的好意  但如果你俩离婚了
<11-8,Raj>I appreciate the offer, but if things don't work out with you two,

432
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,920
<11-8,Raj>我一定像秃鹰一样扑向她
<11-8,Raj>I'm swooping in on her like a vulture.

433
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:55,800
<11-9,Howard>太迟了  斯图尔特先订了
<11-9,Howard>Too late. Stuart called dibs.

434
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:59,000
<11-10,Raj>从理论上说  如果我们
<11-10,Raj>But theoretically, if you and I

435
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,460
<11-10,Raj>是同志关系
<11-10,Raj>were in a gay relationship,

436
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,090
<11-10,Raj>我们怎么告诉大家
<11-10,Raj>how would we tell people?

437
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:05,140
<11-10,Raj>贴出公告吗
<11-10,Raj>Like, print up announcements?

438
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,470
<11-11,Howard>我不知道  贴了公告会有区别吗
<11-11,Howard>I don't know. What difference does it make?

439
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:11,050
<11-12,Raj>我希望所有同志游行都能邀请我们
<11-12,Raj>Well, I want to make sure we get invited to all the parades.

440
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:12,830
<11-13,Howard>听起来的确有趣
<11-13,Howard>Those do look fun.

441
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:15,570
<11-14,Raj>是啊  如果你想穿网眼露脐装游行
<11-14,Raj>Yeah. Well, if you want to march in a fishnet crop top,

442
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:17,950
<11-14,Raj>你最好别碰蘸酱
<11-14,Raj>you better lay off that dip.

443
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,610
<11-15,Howard>如果你不想让我吃
<11-15,Howard>If you didn't want me to eat it,

444
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:21,650
<11-16,Raj>-为什么摆出来  -是给姑娘们的
<11-16,Raj>- why'd you put it out? - It was for the girls.

445
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:24,480
<11-16,Raj>她们甩了我  我才不管她们是否会长胖
<11-16,Raj>They broke up with me-- I don't care if they get fat.

446
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:26,630
<11-17,Howard>我不会长胖的
<11-17,Howard>I'm not gonna get fat.

447
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:30,100
<11-18,Raj>想打赌吗  你从来不锻炼
<11-18,Raj>Oh, you want to bet? You never exercise.

448
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:33,020
<11-19,Howard>瞧着  我现在就锻炼
<11-19,Howard>Fine. Look, I'll exercise right now.

<11-20,Raj>真够成熟的
<11-20,Raj>Very mature.

453
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,060
<11-20,Raj>继续这样吃
<11-20,Raj>Keep eating like that.

454
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,270
<11-20,Raj>你会发心脏病的
<11-20,Raj>You're gonna have a heart attack.

455
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,710
<11-21,Howard>好的  我这样吃呢
<11-21,Howard>Okay. How about if I eat like this?

456
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:51,790
<11-22,Raj>你真幼稚
<11-22,Raj>You're such a child.

457
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:54,220
<11-23,Howard>对你未来老公  你就这种态度吗
<11-23,Howard>Hey, is that any way to talk to your future husband?

458
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,800
<11-24,Raj>我只是假设
<11-24,Raj>Hey, I was being hypothetical, okay?

459
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,900
<11-24,Raj>-我永远不会和你结婚的  -得了
<11-24,Raj>- I would never marry you. - Please.

460
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,720
<11-25,Howard>等你看到我选的求婚戒指时  你会感动到喷泪
<11-25,Howard>When you see the ring I pick out, you're gonna melt.

461
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,290
<11-26,Raj>想得美
<11-26,Raj>Yeah, right.

<11-26,Raj>Wait, is it rose gold?

463
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,820
<11-26,Raj>别告诉我  我想有个惊喜
<11-26,Raj>Actually, don't tell me. I want to be surprised.

464
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:12,820
<12-1,Penny>你最后把机器送回去了吗
<12-1,Penny>So, did you wind up sending that machine back?

465
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:15,600
<12-2,Sheldon>是的  我都不确定它的准度到底行不行
<12-2,Sheldon>I did. You know, I'm not even sure how accurate it was.

466
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,500
<12-2,Sheldon>我把它拿到火车商店  它说所有人都很伤心
<12-2,Sheldon>I took it to the train store-- it said everyone was sad.

467
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:23,430
<12-3,Bernadette>我终于把哈雷哄睡着了
<12-3,Bernadette>I finally got Halley to sleep.

468
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:25,350
<12-4,Raj>我刚看到有一项研究说
<12-4,Raj>You know, I just read a study that suggests

469
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:27,180
<12-4,Raj>初为人母的人在情绪感知方面  有两年的优势
<12-4,Raj>new mothers are better at senseing emotions

470
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,630
<12-4,Raj>比普通人多两年优势
<12-4,Raj>for up to two years.

471
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:29,440
<12-4,Raj>这是真的
<12-4,Raj>It's ture.

472
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,550
<12-5,Amy>怀孕引起大脑的生理变化
<12-5,Amy>Pregnancy causes physiological change in the brain,

473
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:33,310
<12-5,Amy>导致感同身受的能力增加
<12-5,Amy>and resulting increase empathetic.

474
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:36,750
<12-6,Penny>原来我们只需要搞大谢尔顿的肚子就行
<12-6,Penny>So all we need to do is got Shledon knocked up.

<12-7,Leonard>不行  我在动物收容所找到他时  他已经被阉了
<12-7,Leonard>Can't. He's already fixed when I found him at the shelter.

476
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:44,150
<12-8,Sheldon>伯纳黛特  我们来测试下这一理论
<12-8,Sheldon>Hey, Bernadette, let's test this theory.

477
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:46,360
<12-8,Sheldon>你觉得我现在有什么感受
<12-8,Sheldon>What're you thinking I'm feeling right now?

478

480
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:50,600
<12-9,Bernadette>有点可怜我们
<12-9,Bernadette>A little bit sorry for us?

481
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:54,810
<12-9,Bernadette>但最主要是开心不必成为我们这样的人
<12-9,Bernadette>But mostly gald you don't have to be us.

482
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,160
<12-10,Sheldon>接着让她大肚子  她真厉害
<12-10,Sheldon>Keep filling this one with baby, she's good.
