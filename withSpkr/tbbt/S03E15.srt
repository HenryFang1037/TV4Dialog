1
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,930
<1-1,Howard (on the phone)>嗯  我也想你了  亲爱的
<1-1,Howard (on the phone)>Yeah, I miss you, too, sweetie.

2
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:08,770
<1-1,Howard (on the phone)>我得挂了  晚上见吧
<1-1,Howard (on the phone)>Listen, I got to go, but I'll see you tonight?

3
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:11,020
<1-1,Howard (on the phone)>好的 拜拜 拜拜
<1-1,Howard (on the phone)>Okay. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

4
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,850
<1-1,Howard (on the phone)>不  你先挂嘛
<1-1,Howard (on the phone)>No, you hang up first.

5
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:17,070
<1-1,Howard (on the phone)>喂
<1-1,Howard (on the phone)>Hello?

6
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,560
<1-2,Raj>老兄  我为你好不容易找到个女朋友而高兴
<1-2,Raj>Dude, I'm glad you finally got a girlfriend,

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,600
<1-2,Raj>但你非得当着我们这些光棍的面
<1-2,Raj>but do you have to do all that lovey-dovey stuff

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,970
<1-2,Raj>玩那套你亲我热的把戏吗
<1-2,Raj>in front of those of us who don't?

9
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:25,540
<1-3,Sheldon>事实上  他也许该当如此
<1-3,Sheldon>Actually, he might have to.

10
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:28,340
<1-3,Sheldon>在经济学里有种概念被称之为地位商品
<1-3,Sheldon>There's an economic concept known as a positional good

11
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,070
<1-3,Sheldon>它只在持有人手中才能彰显其价值
<1-3,Sheldon>in which an object is only valued by the possessor

12
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,770
<1-3,Sheldon>因为其他人无法拥有
<1-3,Sheldon>because it's not possessed by others.

13
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,510
<1-3,Sheldon>这个词由经济学家弗列得·赫希杜撰于1976年
<1-3,Sheldon>The term was coined in 1976 by economist Fred Hirsch

14
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,610
<1-3,Sheldon>用来取代更口语化  但并不准确的"哦也-哦也"[嘲讽]
<1-3,Sheldon>to replace the more colloquial, but less precise "neener-neener."

15
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:41,770
<1-4,Howard>才不是呢
<1-4,Howard>That's not true.

16
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,170
<1-4,Howard>我的快乐不是建立于
<1-4,Howard>My happiness is not dependent

17
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,640
<1-4,Howard>挚友的杯具与孤独之上的
<1-4,Howard>on my best friend being miserable and alone.

18
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:46,710
<1-5,Raj>谢谢
<1-5,Raj>Thank you.

19
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:49,640
<1-6,Howard>当然  要说我没得儿意地笑肯定是说谎了
<1-6,Howard>Although, I'd be lying if I said it wasn't a little bit of a perk.

20
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:51,720
<1-7,Leonard>谁杯具和孤独了
<1-7,Leonard>Who's miserable and alone?

21
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,340
<1-8,Raj>我
<1-8,Raj>Me.

22
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:55,550
<1-9,Leonard>我以前也这样 直到我有了女朋友
<1-9,Leonard>I used to be like that. Then I got a girlfriend.

23
00:00:55,550 --> 00:01:00,170
<1-10,Sheldon>用1976年之前的话来说  "哦也-哦也"
<1-10,Sheldon>In pre-1976 terms, neener-neener.

24
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,750
<1-11,Leonard>嘿  你和伯纳黛特准备如何 共度你们的第一个情人节
<1-11,Leonard>Hey, what are you and Bernadette doing for your first Valentine's Day?

25
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,560
<1-12,Howard>啊  我可是绞尽脑汁了
<1-12,Howard>Yeah, I am pulling out all the stops.

26
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,690
<1-12,Howard>华馆提供了39.95美金的情侣特典套餐
<1-12,Howard>There's a $39.95 lover's special at P.F. Chang's.

27
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,520
<1-12,Howard>蛋卷啊  饺子啊
<1-12,Howard>Egg rolls, dumplings,

28
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:13,890
<1-12,Howard>数不清的炒菜  最后你还能和门口硕大的
<1-12,Howard>bottomless wok, and you get your picture taken

29
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,720
<1-12,Howard>大理石马合影留念
<1-12,Howard>on the big marble horse out front.

30
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:20,420
<1-13,Sheldon>考虑到圣瓦伦丁是个在公元三世纪
<1-13,Sheldon>Given that Saint Valentine was a third century Roman priest

31
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,120
<1-13,Sheldon>被丢石头和斩首的罗马祭司
<1-13,Sheldon>who was stoned and beheaded,

32
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:24,620
<1-13,Sheldon>在这个夜晚带着女朋友去看一场残忍的凶杀
<1-13,Sheldon>wouldn't a more appropriate celebration of the evening

33
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:27,800
<1-13,Sheldon>难道不是更合情理的庆祝方式吗
<1-13,Sheldon>be taking one's steady gal to witness a brutal murder?

34
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,740
<1-14,Howard>我明白你的意思  但是有选择的话
<1-14,Howard>I understand your point, but given a choice,

35
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,000
<1-14,Howard>犹太人永远选择中国菜
<1-14,Howard>Jews always go with Chinese food.

36
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,890
<1-15,Raj>呃  如果任何人有兴趣
<1-15,Raj>Well, if anyone's interested,

37
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,360
<1-15,Raj>今年的情人节
<1-15,Raj>I'll be spending this Valentine's Day

38
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,390
<1-15,Raj>我会像往年一样
<1-15,Raj>the same way I spend every Valentine's Day.

39
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,220
<1-15,Raj>从超市买只大烤鸡
<1-15,Raj>Buying a rotisserie chicken from the supermarket,

40
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:44,060
<1-15,Raj>带回家  站在洗手池边
<1-15,Raj>taking it home, standing over the sink

41
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:47,890
<1-15,Raj>像只禽兽一样直接打开包装用手抓着吃
<1-15,Raj>and eating it out of the package with my bare hands like an animal.

42
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:51,890
<1-16,Leonard>很好  那总结一下  一个是大理石骏马
<1-16,Leonard>Okay, so to sum up: one giant marble horse,

43
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,320
<1-16,Leonard>一条愚蠢之极的意见 剩男则独自回家吃鸡
<1-16,Leonard>one asinine comment, one lonely man and his chicken.

44
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:58,330
<1-16,Leonard>让我们看看  还剩谁呢
<1-16,Leonard>And let's see. Who's left?

45
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:00,620
<1-16,Leonard>没错  就剩我的计划了
<1-16,Leonard>Oh, that's right. My plans.

46
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,820
<1-16,Leonard>有人想要问一下吗
<1-16,Leonard>Isn't anyone going to ask?

47
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,550
<1-17,Raj>好吧  告诉我们你会和佩妮云雨一番
<1-17,Raj>Fine, tell us you're going to have sex with Penny.

48
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,250
<1-18,Leonard>这不是我想说的
<1-18,Leonard>That's not what I was going to tell you.

49
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,550
<1-19,Raj>没关系 我不介意听听你的性生活
<1-19,Raj>It's okay. I don't mind hearing about your sex life.

50
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:13,990
<1-19,Raj>只有他的才会让我抓狂
<1-19,Raj>It's his that bugs me.

51
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:18,690
<1-20,Leonard>你们猜学校要派谁去瑞士
<1-20,Leonard>Guess who the university is sending to Switzerland

54
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,120
<1-21,Sheldon>诺顿教授  尽管原因只有上帝才知道
<1-21,Sheldon>Professor Norton, although, God knows why.

55
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,690
<1-21,Sheldon>他自从获得诺贝尔奖之后
<1-21,Sheldon>He hasn't published anything of note

56
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,620
<1-21,Sheldon>就再也没有发表过任何著名的文章
<1-21,Sheldon>since he won that Nobel Prize.

57
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,290
<1-22,Leonard>事实上  诺顿教授去不成了
<1-22,Leonard>Actually, Professor Norton can't make it.

58
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,790
<1-22,Leonard>他在攀岩的时候把腰扭了
<1-22,Leonard>He threw his back out rock climbing.

<1-23,Howard>我怎么听说他是在攀新女友的高峰时把腰扭了
<1-23,Howard>I heard he threw his back out climbing on his new girlfriend.

<1-26,Leonard>不管怎样  他们邀请我代替他
<1-26,Leonard>In any case, they're asking me to fill in for him.

63
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:43,620
<1-27,Sheldon>是瑞士还是爆乳天气女郎
<1-27,Sheldon>In Switzerland or with the big-boobed weather girl?

68
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:51,990
<1-31,Sheldon>我太开心了
<1-31,Sheldon>I'm so happy,

69
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:54,690
<1-31,Sheldon>我甚至不想去质疑他们为什么会选你去了
<1-31,Sheldon>I'm not even going to question their judgment in picking you.

70
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,490
<1-31,Sheldon>我要速度奔回家收拾行李
<1-31,Sheldon>I'm just going to run home and start packing.

00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:02,390
<1-32,Raj>你怎么不带佩妮去
<1-32,Raj>Why wouldn't you take Penny?

72
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:06,050
<1-33,Leonard>我是要带佩妮去的
<1-33,Leonard>I am taking Penny.

73
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:11,520
<1-34,Raj>那我预测你回家会面临个尴尬的境地
<1-34,Raj>Well, then I anticipate an awkward situation when you get home.

74
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,100

84
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,870
<2-6,Sheldon>什么 这太荒谬了
<2-6,Sheldon>What? That's absurd.

<2-8,Sheldon>佩妮对亚原子粒子的研究又不感兴趣
<2-8,Sheldon>Penny has no interest in subatomic particle research.

<2-11,Leonard>with a girl since I was six.

97
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,400
<2-12,Sheldon>太可耻了
<2-12,Sheldon>Shame on you!

98
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:37,970
<2-12,Sheldon>这不是科学家该有的梦
<2-12,Sheldon>That's no dream for a scientist!

99
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,140
<3-1,Penny>你要给我什么巨大的惊喜啊
<3-1,Penny>Okay, what's the big surprise?

100
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,800
<3-2,Leonard>稍等一下
<3-2,Leonard>Just a minute.

101
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:45,740
<3-2,Leonard>这个托盘里藏着
<3-2,Leonard>This tray contains clues

102
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,370
<3-2,Leonard>你和我如何共度情人节的线索

<3-3,Penny>Then I'm going to climb on his back and rocket to the moon?

109
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,540
<3-3,Penny>不对
<3-3,Penny>No.

110
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,170
<3-4,Leonard>但的确跟空中旅行有关
<3-4,Leonard>But it does involve air travel.

111
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,000
<3-4,Leonard>这样吧
<3-4,Leonard>Okay, um...

112

<3-4,Leonard>let me slice this Swiss cheese with my Swiss army knife,

113
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:30,840
<3-4,Leonard>你可以把它加到一杯 "瑞士"小姐速溶可可里
<3-4,Leonard>and then you can wash it down with a cup of Swiss Miss instant cocoa.

114
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,970
<3-5,Penny>嗯  我觉得瑞士应该是个关键词了
<3-5,Penny>Okay, I'm starting to think Swiss is key here.

115
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,140
<3-6,Leonard>没错
<3-6,Leonard>Uh-huh.

<3-24,Penny>你们连这个也写进协议里吗
<3-24,Penny>You actually put that in an agreement?

151
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,180
<3-25,Leonard>里面还写了
<3-25,Leonard>Yeah. We also put in what happens

152
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,110

<3-27,Penny>里面没写一人有了女友怎么办吗
<3-27,Penny>Is there anything in there about if one of you gets a girlfriend?

00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:21,950
<3-28,Sheldon>没有  那个有点太不着调了
<3-28,Sheldon>No, that seemed a little farfetched.

00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,680
<3-29,Leonard>谢尔顿  你真打算强制实施这个吗
<3-29,Leonard>Sheldon, do you really expect to enforce this?

<3-30,Sheldon>And I abandoned my goal to master Tuvan throat singing.

<3-31,Penny>-我知道不该问  不过什么是  -别啊
<3-31,Penny>- Okay, I know I shouldn't ask, but what is...? - No.

<3-33,Sheldon (after demonstrating)>如果允许我训练  我能唱得更好

<3-34,Leonard>谢尔顿 我知道协议这么写
<3-34,Leonard>Look, Sheldon, i know it's in the agreement,

<3-34,Leonard>如果你真的变成僵尸  我保证不杀你
<3-34,Leonard>and if you turn into a zombie, I promise I will not kill you.

170
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:05,180
<3-34,Leonard>我宁愿让你喝我脑浆
<3-34,Leonard>In fact, I'll even let you eat my brains.

171
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,280
<3-34,Leonard>但我还是要带佩妮去瑞士
<3-34,Leonard>But I am taking Penny to Switzerland.

00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,100
<6-6,Leonard>你有什么目的
<6-6,Leonard>Why are you doing this?

235
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,230
<6-7,Sheldon>对我近来的行为表示歉意
<6-7,Sheldon>It's by way of an apology for my recent behavior.

236
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:28,330
<6-7,Sheldon>经过这段时间的思考 我终于意识到
<6-7,Sheldon>I've had some time to reflect and I've come to realize

237
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,600
<6-7,Sheldon>友谊不能依靠那堆 白纸黑字的协定来维系
<6-7,Sheldon>that friendship is not an aggregation of written agreements.

238
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:35,430
<6-7,Sheldon>而需要两人之间 互相尊重和体谅
<6-7,Sheldon>It's a result of two people respecting and caring for each other.

239
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,000
<6-7,Sheldon>尝尝奶油烤饼吗

<6-9,Sheldon>一起看导演点评版的 巴比伦5号[美国科幻剧]
<6-9,Sheldon>watching the final season of Babylon 5 with director commentary.

246
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:58,330
<6-10,Leonard>你不是讨厌《巴比伦5号》吗
<6-10,Leonard>You hate Babylon 5.

247
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,760
<6-11,Sheldon>当然  既没剧情又不科幻
<6-11,Sheldon>I do. It fails as drama/science fiction,

248
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,800
<6-11,Sheldon>彻头彻尾的仿制大烂片
<6-11,Sheldon>and it's hopelessly derivative.

249
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:05,760
<6-11,Sheldon>但是你喜欢  而我们又是朋友
<6-11,Sheldon>But you like it, and you're my friend.

250
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:07,900
<6-12,Leonard>好吧  赞
<6-12,Leonard>Okay, great.

251
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,930
<6-12,Leonard>我还是不会带你去瑞士

<7-6,Penny>Better acoustics for your throat singing?

267
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:02,240

346
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,190

<8-15,Sheldon>到底带不带我去
<8-15,Sheldon>Am I going or not?

00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:36,190
<8-19,Sheldon>好吧  那我也别无选择了
<8-19,Sheldon>Well, then, you leave me no alternative.

353
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,890
<8-19,Sheldon>从现在起

354
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:41,060
<8-19,Sheldon>我们可以当室友  但不再是朋友了

00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,120
<8-20,Leonard>很遗憾你这么觉得
<8-20,Leonard>I'm sorry you feel that way.

356
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:44,720

359
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:52,190
<8-23,Sheldon>既然我们"室友协议"中的友谊条款无效了
<8-23,Sheldon>With the friendship clause of our Roommate Agreement nullified

360
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,460
<8-23,Sheldon>等我受邀去比尔·盖茨家游泳的时候
<8-23,Sheldon>you are no longer entitled to accompany me

361
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,920
<8-23,Sheldon>你也就失去了随同一起去的资格
<8-23,Sheldon>to go swimming at Bill Gates' house should I be invited.

362
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:04,060
<8-24,Howard>那可伤大了
<8-24,Howard>Ooh, that's gotta sting.
