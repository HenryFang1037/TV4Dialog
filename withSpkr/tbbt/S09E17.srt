1
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:06,220
<1-1,Amy>谢尔顿  有件事情我一直想跟你谈谈
<1-1,Amy>So Sheldon, there's something I've been wanting to talk about

2
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:08,120
<1-1,Amy>但我知道这话题有些敏感
<1-1,Amy>but I know it's kind of a touchy subject.

3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:10,330
<1-2,Leonard>成功把范围缩小到了任何事
<1-2,Leonard>Way to narrow it down to everything.

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,330
<1-3,Sheldon>什么事
<1-3,Sheldon>What is it?

5
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:14,660
<1-4,Amy>你的生日就快到了
<1-4,Amy>Well, your birthday's coming up.

6
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:15,860
<1-4,Amy>而你从来不让我们帮你庆祝
<1-4,Amy>And you've never let us celebrate it.

7
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:17,800
<1-4,Amy>我在想  或许今年可以帮你庆祝一下
<1-4,Amy>And I was hoping maybe this year we could.

8
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,730
<1-5,Sheldon>我想这话题我们可以讨论
<1-5,Sheldon>Oh, I suppose that's a discussion we could have.

9
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:28,450
<1-6,Amy>那太好了  我觉得呢
<1-6,Amy>Okay, great, I mean,

10
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:30,880
<1-6,Amy>也不见得一定得是盛大的派对之类的
<1-6,Amy>it doesn't have to be a big party or anything.

11
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:31,830
<1-6,Amy>我只是...
<1-6,Amy>I was just...

12
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:36,910
<1-6,Amy>他上哪去了
<1-6,Amy>Where'd he go?

13
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:37,900
<1-7,Penny>等等
<1-7,Penny>W-Wait a minute.

14
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,810
<1-7,Penny>你一提到他的生日  他就落跑了吗
<1-7,Penny>You mention his birthday and he vanishes?

15
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:44,220
<1-8,Leonard>这资讯这些年来都"躲哪去"了啊
<1-8,Leonard>Well, where's that information been this whole time?

26
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,370
<2-1,Penny>他上哪了
<2-1,Penny>Well, where is he?

27
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:15,320
<2-2,Amy>谢尔顿
<2-2,Amy>Sheldon?

28
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,630
<2-3,Leonard>我去看看他房间
<2-3,Leonard>I'll check his room.

29
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:18,030
<2-4,Sheldon>惊喜
<2-4,Sheldon>Surprise!

30
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:19,740
<2-5,Penny>妈呀
<2-5,Penny>Oh, my God!

31
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:21,260
<2-6,Sheldon>这只是其中一个
<2-6,Sheldon>Just one example

32
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:23,760
<2-6,Sheldon>生日能怎么恶心你的例子
<2-6,Sheldon>of how birthdays can be terrible.

33
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,390
<2-6,Sheldon>我们现在可以放下这事
<2-6,Sheldon>Now, can we please drop this subject

34
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:27,360
<2-6,Sheldon>重新选个话题了吗
<2-6,Sheldon>and pick a new one?

35
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,010
<2-6,Sheldon>我提议聊聊  汤变成炖汤前
<2-6,Sheldon>Yeah, I suggest how thick can a soup get

36
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:31,470
<2-6,Sheldon>所能达到的最高浓稠度是多少
<2-6,Sheldon>before it becomes a stew?

37
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:34,320
<2-6,Sheldon>相信我  答案可能会让你很惊讶哟
<2-6,Sheldon>You know, the answer, it may surprise you.

38
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,260
<2-7,Amy>抱歉我提起这事
<2-7,Amy>I'm sorry I brought it up.

39
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:37,520
<2-8,Penny>问题到底在哪
<2-8,Penny>Yeah, what is the problem?

40
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,120
<2-8,Penny>是因为越来越老吗
<2-8,Penny>Is it about getting older?

41
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,430
<2-9,Sheldon>拜托  你看我陶瓷般光滑的肌肤
<2-9,Sheldon>Please, look at this porcelain skin.

42
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,780
<2-9,Sheldon>我简直就是人形洗手台
<2-9,Sheldon>I'm like a human sink.

43
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,090
<2-10,Amy>但这是一年中  全世界绕着你转的一天呢
<2-10,Amy>But it's the one day a year that's just all about you.

44
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:49,820
<2-11,Leonard>就一天吗
<2-11,Leonard>One day.

45
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,500
<2-11,Leonard>呵呵
<2-11,Leonard>Ha ha.

46
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,500
<2-11,Leonard>对对对
<2-11,Leonard>Right.

47
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,560
<2-12,Amy>求你就告诉我原因吧
<2-12,Amy>Can you please just tell me why?

48
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,300
<2-12,Amy>好吧
<2-12,Amy>Fine.

49
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:05,600
<2-13,Sheldon>你也知道  我有一个双胞胎妹妹
<2-13,Sheldon>As you know, I have a twin sister

50
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,800
<2-13,Sheldon>不用想也知道我们分享着同一个生日
<2-13,Sheldon>with whom I obviously share a birthday.

51
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,560
<2-13,Sheldon>每年我们都会办一个派对
<2-13,Sheldon>Every year we'd have a party.

52
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,000
<2-13,Sheldon>但我邀请的所有人都不会来
<2-13,Sheldon>No one I invited would ever come,

53
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,910
<2-13,Sheldon>因为他们不喜欢我
<2-13,Sheldon>because they didn't like me.

54
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:15,170
<2-14,Amy>对不起
<2-14,Amy>I'm sorry.

55
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:16,370
<2-15,Sheldon>这部分没多糟
<2-15,Sheldon>Oh, that part wasn't so bad.

56
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,990
<2-15,Sheldon>因为我也不喜欢他们
<2-15,Sheldon>I didn't like them, either.

57
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,390
<2-15,Sheldon>但在那天我永远也躲不过
<2-15,Sheldon>But then I'd inevitably spend the whole day

58
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,110
<2-15,Sheldon>我妹妹的朋友折磨的命运
<2-15,Sheldon>being tortured by my sister's friends.

59
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,430
<2-16,Penny>你个可怜的小家伙
<2-16,Penny>Oh, you poor thing.

60
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:27,440
<2-17,Sheldon>我六岁那年  他们说蝙蝠侠要来我的派对
<2-17,Sheldon>When I was six, they told me Batman was coming to my party.

61
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,990
<2-17,Sheldon>我在门口等了无数小时
<2-17,Sheldon>I waited by the door for hours.

62
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:30,470
<2-17,Sheldon>我看到最接近蝙蝠侠的事物
<2-17,Sheldon>Closest thing to Batman I saw

63
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:33,410
<2-17,Sheldon>是一只知更鸟[罗宾]撞到窗户
<2-17,Sheldon>was when a robin flew into the window.

64
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,950
<2-18,Amy>你知道那些事情现在不会再发生了吧
<2-18,Amy>You realize none of those things would happen now?

65
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,970
<2-19,Sheldon>我知道啊  但你干嘛在意
<2-19,Sheldon>I do, but why do you care

66
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:42,150
<2-19,Sheldon>我要不要庆祝我生日啊
<2-19,Sheldon>if I celebrate my birthday at all?

67
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:45,090
<2-20,Amy>你给了我上次生日留下那么难忘的回忆
<2-20,Amy>Well, you made my last birthday so memorable,

68
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:47,060
<2-20,Amy>我想报答你
<2-20,Amy>I wanted to return the favor.

69
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,670
<2-21,Penny>如果你现在举办派对
<2-21,Penny>Yeah, if you had a party now,

70
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:50,830
<2-21,Penny>你有许多会乐意来参加的朋友呢
<2-21,Penny>you have plenty of friends that would love to come.

71
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:52,380
<2-22,Leonard>而我们就住在这  想不来都不行呢
<2-22,Leonard>And we live here, so we have no choice.

72
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,440
<2-23,Penny>对啊
<2-23,Penny>Yeah.

73
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,040
<2-24,Sheldon>那好吧
<2-24,Sheldon>Very well.

74
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,010
<2-24,Sheldon>朕就恩准你们  通过举办有蛋糕  礼物
<2-24,Sheldon>You may celebrate my life by throwing a party

75
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:02,190
<2-24,Sheldon>无尽对我赞美爱慕的派对  来庆祝我的诞辰
<2-24,Sheldon>with cake, presents and a shower of admiration and love.

76
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:04,460
<2-24,Sheldon>但这事你可欠我一个大人情
<2-24,Sheldon>But then you owe me big-time.

77
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,690
<3-1,Howard>谢尔顿的首次生日派对
<3-1,Howard>You have any idea what you're getting

78
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:09,980
<3-1,Howard>你想到送什么礼物了吗
<3-1,Howard>Sheldon for his birthday?

79
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:12,290
<3-2,Raj>他最近很迷恐龙
<3-2,Raj>He's been fascinated with dinosaurs lately.

80
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,150
<3-2,Raj>或许我们能给他搞个化石
<3-2,Raj>Maybe we could get him a fossil.

81
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,950
<3-3,Leonard>别给他侏罗纪时期的化石
<3-3,Leonard>Well, just don't get anything Jurassic.

82
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:19,430
<3-3,Leonard>他觉得那整段时期已经被好莱坞化了
<3-3,Leonard>He feels like that whole chunk of time has gone Hollywood.

83
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:23,220
<3-3,Leonard>对了  我想到
<3-3,Leonard>dort dort dort Hey, uh, you know,

84
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,110
<3-3,Leonard>他说了一件悲惨往事
<3-3,Leonard>he told a sad story about how his sister

85
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:29,390
<3-3,Leonard>当年他妹骗他蝙蝠侠会来参加他的派对
<3-3,Leonard>tricked him into thinking Batman was coming to his party.

86
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:30,540
<3-4,Howard>这招有意思
<3-4,Howard>That's funny.

87
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,110
<3-4,Howard>咱们也来用一次
<3-4,Howard>Let's do that.

88
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,250
<3-5,Leonard>或许我们可以让蝙蝠侠真的来参加
<3-5,Leonard>Maybe we could get Batman to actually show up.

89
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,080
<3-6,Raj>你是说穿着白痴变装服的人吗
<3-6,Raj>You mean, some guy in a lame suit?

90
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,400
<3-7,Leonard>或者是真的蝙蝠侠  斯图尔特
<3-7,Leonard>Or a real Batman. Hey, Stuart?

91
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,180
<3-7,Leonard>你不是有一次想找亚当·韦斯特来办签名会吗
<3-7,Leonard>Didn't you try to get Adam West to do a signing here once?

93
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:45,770
<3-8,Stuart>是啊  当时在日程安排上有些冲突
<3-8,Stuart>Yeah, but there was kind of a scheduling conflict.

94
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:48,480
<3-8,Stuart>他想知道哪一天能收到钱
<3-8,Stuart>He, uh, wanted to know when he'd get paid.

95
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,430
<3-8,Stuart>而我不愿意告诉他
<3-8,Stuart>And I wouldn't tell him.

96
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:54,120
<3-9,Leonard>能给我他的联系方式吗
<3-9,Leonard>Can I get his contact info?

97
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,550
<3-10,Stuart>行啊  但我先警告你
<3-10,Stuart>Sure, uh, but just so you know,

98
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,170
<3-10,Stuart>这人就是一事儿精
<3-10,Stuart>he's kind of a diva.

00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:59,740
<3-11,Leonard>-是吗  -要了亲命
<3-11,Leonard>- He is? - Oh, yeah.

00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,500
<3-12,Stuart>不愿意搭乘巴士
<3-12,Stuart>Won't take the bus.

101
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,330
<3-12,Stuart>不愿意自己准备午餐
<3-12,Stuart>He won't pack his own lunch.

102
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:05,300
<3-12,Stuart>不愿意让你在他家沙发上过夜
<3-12,Stuart>Won't let you spend the night on his couch.

103
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:10,750
<4-1,Amy>你们对派对气球有何想法
<4-1,Amy>Okay, so how do you feel about party balloons?

00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,500
<4-2,Sheldon>铝箔气球  可以
<4-2,Sheldon>Uh, Mylar balloons, yes.

105
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,090
<4-2,Sheldon>乳胶气球  拒绝
<4-2,Sheldon>Latex balloons, no.

106
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,280
<4-2,Sheldon>水球  我会上天台跳楼
<4-2,Sheldon>Water balloons, I will jump off the roof

107
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,740
<4-2,Sheldon>而且对准你的车跳
<4-2,Sheldon>and aim for your car.

108
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,680
<4-3,Penny>那音乐呢
<4-3,Penny>All right, what about music?

109
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,870
<4-4,Sheldon>我喜欢游行乐队
<4-4,Sheldon>I enjoy marching bands

110
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:25,300
<4-4,Sheldon>以及西藏喉音唱法
<4-4,Sheldon>and Tibetan throat singing.

111
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,080
<4-5,Penny>那就是不放音乐
<4-5,Penny>No music it is.

112
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,760
<4-6,Bernadette>你喜欢哪种蛋糕
<4-6,Bernadette>What kind of cake do you like?

113
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,560
<4-7,Sheldon>我的最爱是巧克力蛋糕搭配草莓糖霜
<4-7,Sheldon>Well, my favorite is chocolate with strawberry frosting,

<4-7,Sheldon>内含三层  如果要在上面题字
<4-7,Sheldon>three layers, and if there's writing on it,

115
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,260
<4-7,Sheldon>请确保别全都用大写
<4-7,Sheldon>make sure it's not all caps.

116
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,750
<4-7,Sheldon>我不想感觉我的蛋糕在吼我
<4-7,Sheldon>I don't need my dessert yelling at me.

118
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:44,300
<5-1,Raj>亚当·韦斯特在电话里听上去怎么样
<5-1,Raj>Hey, so what was Adam West like on the phone?

119
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,690
<5-2,Leonard>挺友好的
<5-2,Leonard>Uh, nice guy.

120
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:47,830
<5-2,Leonard>但听到蝙蝠侠说出一些话  还是有点怪
<5-2,Leonard>But it was a little weird to hear Batman say,

121
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:51,360
<5-2,Leonard>他说"不要按门铃  我的贵宾犬会暴怒"
<5-2,Leonard>"Don't ring the doorbell or my poodles will go crazy."

122
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,220
<5-3,Raj>你们知道亚当·韦斯特是我最喜欢的蝙蝠侠吗
<5-3,Raj>You know, Adam West is my favorite Batman?

128
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,460
<5-4,Howard>这种话你可别对他说
<5-4,Howard>Don't say that to him.

129
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,290
<5-5,Raj>干嘛  他可是排在乔治·克鲁尼前呢
<5-5,Raj>What? He beat out George Clooney.

131
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:06,100
<5-5,Raj>很了不起了好吗
<5-5,Raj>And that's something.

132
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,980
<5-5,Raj>也不想想我多爱克鲁尼啊
<5-5,Raj>Like, I love me some Clooney.

133
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:11,630
<5-6,Leonard>这种话你可别对任何人说
<5-6,Leonard>Don't say that to anyone.

00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,860
<6-1,Penny>谢谢你来帮我们  斯图尔特
<6-1,Penny>Thank you so much for helping us, Stuart.

135
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:19,230
<6-2,Stuart>我很庆幸你们能邀请我
<6-2,Stuart>Oh, I-I was just glad to be invited.

136
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:21,700
<6-2,Stuart>老实说  我一直觉得自己不属于你们的小团队
<6-2,Stuart>To be honest, I don't always feel like I'm part of the group.

137
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,950
<6-3,Penny>亲爱的  我们赶时间
<6-3,Penny>Okay, sweetie, we're on the clock here.

138
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:25,580
<6-3,Penny>你能不能一边自怨自艾  一边抹糖霜呢
<6-3,Penny>Can you hate yourself and frost at the same time?

139
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,400
<6-4,Barry>希望我没来太早
<6-4,Barry>Hello, I hope I'm not too early.

140
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,510
<6-5,Bernadette>没有没有  快进来
<6-5,Bernadette>No, no, no. Come on in.

141
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:33,340
<6-6,Barry>容光焕发的准妈妈近来如何
<6-6,Barry>And how is the radiant mommy-to-be?

142
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,880
<6-7,Bernadette>非常棒
<6-7,Bernadette>Doing great.

143
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:36,740
<6-8,Stuart>你怀孕了吗
<6-8,Stuart>Y-You're pregnant?

144
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,460
<6-9,Bernadette>是的
<6-9,Bernadette>Yeah.

145
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:42,560
<6-10,Stuart>听起来像是小团队成员之间该知道的事情
<6-10,Stuart>Sounds like something a member of the group might know.

146
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,880
<6-11,Penny>是啊  生日派对优先办
<6-11,Penny>Yeah, birthday party first.

147
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,610
<6-11,Penny>自怜派对往后站
<6-11,Penny>Pity party later.

148
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:49,940
<7-1,Leonard>你疯了吗
<7-1,Leonard>Are you crazy?

149
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,580
<7-1,Leonard>你怎么能把迈克尔·基顿
<7-1,Leonard>How can you put Michael Keaton

150
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,330
<7-1,Leonard>排在克里斯汀·贝尔之前呢
<7-1,Leonard>in front of Christian Bale?

151
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:55,940
<7-2,Adam West>得了吧
<7-2,Adam West>Oh, please.

152
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:02,170
<7-2,Adam West>就连我的贵宾犬都知道贝尔被高估了
<7-2,Adam West>Even my poodles know Bale's overrated.

153
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,450
<7-2,Adam West>谢谢
<7-2,Adam West>Thank you!

154
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:05,390
<7-3,Raj>所以我觉得迈克尔·基顿排第一
<7-3,Raj>That's why I say Keaton's number one.

155
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:07,100
<7-3,Raj>他为这角色注入了一丝幽默感
<7-3,Raj>He brought a sense of humor to the role.

156
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,050
<7-4,Adam>如果你要连幽默感都考虑进去
<7-4,Adam>Oh, if you're gonna factor in a sense of humor,

157
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:12,630
<7-4,Adam>那我才应该排第一
<7-4,Adam>then I should be at the top of the list.

158
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:15,020
<7-4,Adam>排名应该是  我
<7-4,Adam>It should be me,

159
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,500
<7-4,Adam>基顿  基默
<7-4,Adam>Keaton, Kilmer,

161
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,380
<7-4,Adam>乐高蝙蝠侠  贝尔
<7-4,Adam>Lego, Bale,

162
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,950
<7-4,Adam>最后才是那个美男克鲁尼
<7-4,Adam>and that pretty boy Clooney.

163
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,520
<7-7,Leonard>不是吧  你排在贝尔前面吗
<7-7,Leonard>Really? You're ahead of Bale?

164
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,670
<7-5,Howard>这个男人可是这句话的化身啊
<7-5,Howard>The man who personified the words,

165
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:30,120
<7-5,Howard>我是蝙蝠侠
<7-5,Howard>I'm Batman.

166
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,170
<7-6,Adam>我从来不用说我是蝙蝠侠
<7-6,Adam>I never had to say I'm Batman.

167
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:32,970
<7-6,Adam>我一出现
<7-6,Adam>I showed up.

168
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:36,420
<7-6,Adam>人们就知道我是蝙蝠侠
<7-6,Adam>People knew I was Batman.

169
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:39,460
<7-6,Adam>所到之处  无论是上电视节目
<7-6,Adam>Everywhere I went-- on the TV show,

170
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,160
<7-6,Adam>参加商场开幕
<7-6,Adam>mall openings...

171
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,790
<7-6,Adam>甚至茱莉·纽玛家
<7-6,Adam>Julie Newmar's bungalow.

173
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:49,550
<7-7,Leonard>我被说服了  你该排在贝尔前面
<7-7,Leonard>I'm sold-- you're ahead of Bale.

174
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,050
<7-8,Adam>还有一个我排名应该更靠前的原因
<7-8,Adam>There's another reason I should be higher on the list.

175
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:54,220
<7-8,Adam>其他那些家伙
<7-8,Adam>All those other guys

176
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:57,480
<7-8,Adam>他们的戏服上还有假肌肉线条
<7-8,Adam>had muscles built into their costumes.

177
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,220
<7-8,Adam>而我的蝙蝠衣
<7-8,Adam>All I had in my Batsuit

178
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:04,960
<7-8,Adam>全靠爷的一级身材把肌肉线条撑出来
<7-8,Adam>was 100%, grade-A West.

179
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,810
<7-9,Howard>那我们都同意对阿弗莱克的演出有些发虚吗
<7-9,Howard>Can we just all agree we're worried about Affleck?

181
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:10,790
<7-11,Raj>-没错  -当然
<7-11,Raj>- Sure. - Yeah, of course.

182
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,060
<7-12,Adam>阿弗莱克是什么
<7-12,Adam>What's an Affleck?

183
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,810
<8-1,Sheldon>为什么我非得离开我自己的公寓
<8-1,Sheldon>Is there a reason I had to leave my own apartment?

184
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:21,120
<8-2,Amy>我觉得是他们想你看看
<8-2,Amy>Well, I think they just want you to see it

185
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,510
<8-2,Amy>公寓第一次被精心布置的样子
<8-2,Amy>for the first time all decorated.

186
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:26,600
<8-3,Sheldon>但我不在  谁来告诉他们做得不对呢
<8-3,Sheldon>But who's gonna tell them they're doing it wrong?

187
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,100
<8-4,Amy>我确信他们会让你发表感言
<8-4,Amy>Well, I'm... I'm sure they'll ask you to give a speech,

188
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,700
<8-4,Amy>到时候你再毒舌送他们上西天
<8-4,Amy>and that's when you just tear 'em a new one.

189
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,850
<8-4,Amy>不得不说
<8-4,Amy>Have to say, you...

190
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:37,430
<8-4,Amy>你穿这身西服看起来很帅
<8-4,Amy>you do look good in that suit.

191
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,260
<8-5,Sheldon>谢谢
<8-5,Sheldon>Oh. Thank you.

192
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,460
<8-6,Amy>或许晚点我会...
<8-6,Amy>Maybe later I'll, uh...

193
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,720
<8-6,Amy>有机会看你穿上生日装[裸体]
<8-6,Amy>get to see you in your birthday suit.

194
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:50,410
<8-7,Sheldon>但这就是我的生日服
<8-7,Sheldon>But this is my birthday suit.

195
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,280
<8-7,Sheldon>你是不是中风了
<8-7,Sheldon>Are you having a stroke?

196
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:58,330
<8-7,Sheldon>因为这种病会毁了生日派对的
<8-7,Sheldon>Because that's the kind of thing that just ruins a birthday party.

197
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,910
<9-1,Leonard>妈妈  很惊讶你特意赶来
<9-1,Leonard>So, Mother, I'm surprised you came all this way

198
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:04,130
<9-1,Leonard>参加谢尔顿的生日
<9-1,Leonard>for Sheldon's birthday.

199
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:05,400
<9-2,Beverley>我很乐意这么做
<9-2,Beverley>Oh, I was happy to.

200
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,550
<9-2,Beverley>他也来参加我的60大寿了
<9-2,Beverley>He did come to my 60th.

201
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:10,960
<9-3,Leonard>你还搞了派对庆祝你60岁吗
<9-3,Leonard>Oh. You had a party for your 60th?

202
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,380
<9-4,Beverley>我不会称其为"派对"
<9-4,Beverley>Oh, I wouldn't call it a party.

203
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,820
<9-4,Beverley>就邀请了几个亲近的朋友
<9-4,Beverley>Just a few close friends.

204
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:19,130
<9-4,Beverley>还有你的兄弟姐妹
<9-4,Beverley>And your sister and brother.

205
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,660
<9-5,Penny>公平来说  我们在赌城结婚
<9-5,Penny>You know, to be fair, we did get married in Vegas

206
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,610
<9-5,Penny>也没邀请她啊
<9-5,Penny>and didn't invite her.

207
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:27,480
<9-6,Beverley>我还没有机会为此好好谢你呢  亲爱的
<9-6,Beverley>And I never did thank you for that, dear.

208
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,880
<10-1,Amy>佩妮说大家都到了  你准备好了吗
<10-1,Amy>Penny says everyone's there. Are you ready?

209
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:37,950
<10-2,Sheldon>好了
<10-2,Sheldon>I am.

210
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:47,140
<10-3,Amy>等等  你还好吗
<10-3,Amy>Wait. Are you all right?

211
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:49,570
<10-4,Sheldon>不好  我有一点头晕
<10-4,Sheldon>No, I just... I got a little light-headed.

212
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:52,160
<10-5,Amy>你需要休息下吗
<10-5,Amy>Oh, d-do you need a minute?

213
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:54,060
<10-5,Amy>不用了
<10-5,Amy>No.

214
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:57,160
<10-6,Sheldon>如果我能从橱窗有鹦鹉的那个宠物店走过
<10-6,Sheldon>No, if I can walk past that pet shop with the parrot in the window,

215
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,360
<10-6,Sheldon>那我也能撑过这个
<10-6,Sheldon>I suppose I can do this.

216
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:06,640
<10-7,All>生日快乐
<10-7,All>Happy birthday!

217
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,800

<10-10,Sheldon>非常感谢大家的到来
<10-10,Sheldon>Uh, thank you all so much for coming.

220
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,040
<10-10,Sheldon>贝弗莉
<10-10,Sheldon>Uh, Beverly.

221
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:19,590
<10-10,Sheldon>威尔·惠顿
<10-10,Sheldon>Wil Wheaton.

222
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:22,900
<10-10,Sheldon>不知道为啥  亚当·韦斯特也来了
<10-10,Sheldon>Adam West, for some reason.

223
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:26,260
<10-11,Leonard>蝙蝠侠总算来参加你的生日派对了
<10-11,Leonard>Batman finally came to your party.

224
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,830
<10-12,Adam>生日快乐  谢尔曼

225
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:33,650
<10-12,Adam>谢谢你
<10-12,Adam>Thank you.

226
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:36,280
<10-13,Sheldon>这一切真是太有心了
<10-13,Sheldon>This is all so thoughtful.

227
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,520
<10-13,Sheldon>抱歉
<10-13,Sheldon>Excuse me.

228
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,450
<10-14,Adam>你们还是会付我钱吧
<10-14,Adam>I still get paid, don't I?

229
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:04,000
<11-1,Leonard>我看我还是进去和他好好谈一谈吧
<11-1,Leonard>Okay, I'd better go in there and talk to him.

230
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,230
<11-2,Amy>你不觉得应该由我进去和他谈吗
<11-2,Amy>Well, don't you think I'm the one who should go in?

231
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:09,610
<11-3,Leonard>无意冒犯  但我和他可是老交情了
<11-3,Leonard>No offense, but I've known the guy a really long time.

232
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:10,740
<11-4,Amy>你知道  我曾经
<11-4,Amy>Well, I've, you know,

233
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,290
<11-4,Amy>见过他光屁股的样子
<11-4,Amy>seen him without pants on.

234
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,310
<11-5,Leonard>再一次无意冒犯  但我也见过
<11-5,Leonard>Again, no offense, but so have I.

235
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,810
<11-6,Amy>他还曾经见过我光屁股的样子
<11-6,Amy>Well, he's seen me without pants on.

236
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:20,480
<11-7,Leonard>再一次无意冒犯...
<11-7,Leonard>Again, no...

237
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,700
<11-8,Penny>你们俩够了
<11-8,Penny>Okay, this is ridiculous.

238
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:26,630
<11-8,Penny>谢尔顿
<11-8,Penny>Sheldon?

239
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:28,330
<11-8,Penny>我可以进来吗
<11-8,Penny>Can I come in?

240
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:32,100
<11-9,Sheldon>你怎么知道我不是在上厕所
<11-9,Sheldon>How do you know I'm not using the facilities?

241
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,590
<11-10,Penny>因为你每周都会把你的如厕时间表发给我
<11-10,Penny>Because you e-mail me your bathroom schedule once a week,

242
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,080
<11-10,Penny>尽管我点击退订这个周报
<11-10,Penny>even though I've clicked unsubscribe,

243
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,850
<11-10,Penny>快1000次了
<11-10,Penny>like, a thousand times.

244
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,820
<11-10,Penny>所以...
<11-10,Penny>So...

245
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,410
<11-10,Penny>你是怎么了
<11-10,Penny>what's going on?

246
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:48,750
<11-10,Penny>我不知道
<11-10,Penny>I don't know.

247
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,140
<11-11,Sheldon>我环顾四周
<11-11,Sheldon>I-I looked around the room,

248
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:52,740
<11-11,Sheldon>看到一张张笑脸和满屋的礼物
<11-11,Sheldon>and I saw all the faces and the presents,

249
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:55,560
<11-11,Sheldon>压力如排山倒海般袭来
<11-11,Sheldon>and it... it was just too much.

250
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:57,790
<11-11,Sheldon>我懂你的意思
<11-11,Sheldon>I get that.

251
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:02,140
<11-12,Penny>你想不想只叫几个人进来
<11-12,Penny>Hey, you want to just bring a few people in here?

252
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,770
<11-12,Penny>威尔·惠顿坐在浴缸里
<11-12,Penny>You know, Wil Wheaton in the bathtub,

253
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:06,000
<11-12,Penny>蝙蝠侠坐在马桶上
<11-12,Penny>Batman on the toilet.

254
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,090
<11-12,Penny>把这里打造成最诡异的漫画展
<11-12,Penny>It'll be like the weirdest Comic-Con ever.

255
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,400
<11-13,Sheldon>我知道你们费心安排了这一切
<11-13,Sheldon>I know that you worked hard to put this together.

256
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,020
<11-13,Sheldon>抱歉我破坏了一切
<11-13,Sheldon>I'm sorry I'm ruining it.

257
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,380
<11-14,Penny>你才没有破坏呢
<11-14,Penny>Oh, pl... You're not ruining it.

258
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,280
<11-14,Penny>拉杰本还准备在某个时刻让大家
<11-14,Penny>Look, at some point, Raj will try to get everyone

259
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,560
<11-14,Penny>一起跳滑步舞
<11-14,Penny>to do the Electric Slide.

260
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,520
<11-14,Penny>那才会毁掉一切呢
<11-14,Penny>Now, that will ruin it.

261
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,050
<11-15,Sheldon>我可能没法再回去客厅了
<11-15,Sheldon>I don't think I can go back out there.

262
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,240
<11-16,Penny>没关系
<11-16,Penny>That's fine.

263
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,830
<11-16,Penny>我很恨你妹妹和她的朋友
<11-16,Penny>You know, I hate that your sister and her friends

264
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:44,400
<11-16,Penny>曾经折磨过你
<11-16,Penny>used to torture you.

265
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,640
<11-16,Penny>但我更厌恶的是  如果那时候我在
<11-16,Penny>But what I hate even more is, if I was there,

266
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,950
<11-16,Penny>我可能也会一起折磨你
<11-16,Penny>I would have tortured you, too.

267
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:55,610
<11-17,Sheldon>从你的这加油打气来看  你还在折磨我呢
<11-17,Sheldon>Based on this pep talk, I'd say you're still doing it.

268
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:57,300
<11-18,Penny>我的意思是
<11-18,Penny>My point is,

269
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,920
<11-18,Penny>要是以前  我肯定不会
<11-18,Penny>there was a time I never would've been friends

270
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,430
<11-18,Penny>和你这样的人做朋友  但现在...
<11-18,Penny>with someone like you, and now...

271
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,010
<11-18,Penny>你成了我最喜欢的人之一
<11-18,Penny>you are one of my favorite people.

272
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:05,090
<11-18,Penny>所以  如果你希望
<11-18,Penny>So, if what you need is

273
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:08,060
<11-18,Penny>在厕所里过你的生日
<11-18,Penny>to spend your birthday in a bathroom,

274
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,910
<11-18,Penny>我也很愿意陪着你
<11-18,Penny>I'm happy to do it with you.

275
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:15,530
<11-19,Sheldon>大家肯定会觉得我是怪胎
<11-19,Sheldon>Well, everyone will think I'm weird.

276
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,630
<11-20,Penny>亲爱的  你的确很怪异
<11-20,Penny>Sweetie, you are weird.

277
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:27,230
<11-20,Penny>每个人都知道你是个异类
<11-20,Penny>Everyone knows you're weird,

278
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:28,490
<11-20,Penny>但他们今天齐聚一堂
<11-20,Penny>but they're all still here

279
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:31,780
<11-20,Penny>是因为他们发自内心地在乎你
<11-20,Penny>because they care about you so much.

280
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:33,530
<11-20,Penny>对不起
<11-20,Penny>Hello.

281
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:34,460
<11-21,Barry (knocking)>有人需要进来打理一下发型
<11-21,Barry (knocking)>Some of us need to check our hair

282
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:39,130
<11-21,Barry (knocking)>因为可能有机会和莱纳德的妈妈"来一发"哦
<11-21,Barry (knocking)>because we might have a shot with Leonard's mother.

283
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:42,650
<12-1,Leslie Winkle>莱纳德
<12-1,Leslie Winkle>Leonard.

<12-4,Leonard>I can't remember the last time we talked.

287
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,620
<12-4,Leonard>物是人非啊
<12-4,Leonard>So much has changed.

288
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,470

292
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:01,380
<12-7,Leslie>我以为你这辈子都会和谢尔顿住在一起呢
<12-7,Leslie>I thought you'd be living with Sheldon forever.

293
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,250
<12-8,Leonard>这个嘛...
<12-8,Leonard>Yeah, well...

<12-9,Penny>Sheldon is gonna come back out,

297
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,260
<12-9,Penny>但他有点不好意思
<12-9,Penny>but I think he's a little embarrassed,

298
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:14,180
<12-9,Penny>所以大家一定要分外友善  好吗
<12-9,Penny>so let's all be extra nice, okay?

299
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,480

<12-10,Barry>我就是个圣人好吗
<12-10,Barry>I'm a saint.

301
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:19,540
<12-10,Barry>但我也是床上小恶魔哟
<12-10,Barry>But a sinner in the sack.

<12-11,Sheldon>希望我没有给大家派对的兴头泼冷水
<12-11,Sheldon>I hope it hasn't put a damper on the party.

<12-11,Sheldon>所以请大家尽情地玩吧

312
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,710
<12-12,Amy>收取礼物
<12-12,Amy>to receive presents,

313
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:52,120
