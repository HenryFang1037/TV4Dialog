4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,810
<1-3,Sheldon>我们刚吃了泰国料理
<1-3,Sheldon>We just had Thai food.

5
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,570
<1-3,Sheldon>在泰国文化中  最后一口食物
<1-3,Sheldon>In that culture, the last morsel is called

6
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,790
<1-3,Sheldon>被称为"Greng宰"  它应该被赏赐给
<1-3,Sheldon>the "Greng Jai" piece, and it is reserved for

7
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:19,400
<1-3,Sheldon>一群人中最重要最有价值的那个人

<1-5,Sheldon>我见识到了令堂曾经的影子  您继续吃吧
<1-5,Sheldon>I've seen pictures of your mother, keep eating.

10
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,090
<1-6,Howard>好了亲爱的  如果我们要看电影  现在就该走了
<1-6,Howard>All right, honey, if we're gonna make the movie, we should go.

11
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,260
<1-6,Howard>这话你可能不喜欢听
<1-6,Howard>This may be hard for you to hear,

12
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,350
<1-6,Howard>我说的"亲爱的"  指的是我的未婚妻
<1-6,Howard>but when I say "honey," I mean my fiance.

13
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:53,890
<1-6,Howard>我懂  起码现在指的是她了
<1-6,Howard>Yeah, well, now it means her.

14
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,790
<1-7,Bernadette>他想来也没关系的
<1-7,Bernadette>It's okay if he wants to come.

15
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:01,160
<1-8,Howard>好吧  但下次我们得找个保姆了
<1-8,Howard>Fine. But next time, we get a sitter.

16
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,340
<1-9,Penny>好了  我也得上班了
<1-9,Penny>All right, I got to go to work.

17
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,340
<1-9,Penny>-我跟你们一起走  -等下
<1-9,Penny>- I'll walk down with you.  - Wait.

18
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,340
<1-10,Sheldon>你们谁的目的地离蒙罗维亚新开的玩具火车店近些
<1-10,Sheldon>Which is closer to the new train store in Monrovia,

19
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,260
<1-10,Sheldon>电影院还是芝士工厂
<1-10,Sheldon>the movie theater or The Cheesecake Factory?

20
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:12,650
<1-11,Howard>哪个都不近
<1-11,Howard>Neither of them are close.

21
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:13,640
<1-12,Sheldon>这样一来  想必你们谁送我去
<1-12,Sheldon>Oh, well, then I guess it doesn't matter

22
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,560
<1-12,Sheldon>都没有太大关系了
<1-12,Sheldon>which one of you drives me.

23
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,350
<1-12,Sheldon>我们玩个有趣的猜谜游戏
<1-12,Sheldon>Let's play a fun guessing game

24
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:18,750
<1-12,Sheldon>来决定谁送我去吧
<1-12,Sheldon>to see who gets to take me.

25
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,160
<1-12,Sheldon>开始了  这个四字母单词既描述了
<1-12,Sheldon>All right, this four-letter word describes either

26
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:26,760
<1-12,Sheldon>一个打印机的字号  又描述了一种强迫受辱的行为
<1-12,Sheldon>a printer's type size or a compulsion to eat dirt.

27
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,910
<1-13,Penny>事先声明  我才不送他去呢
<1-13,Penny>Okay, I'm not driving him.

28
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:30,090
<1-14,Sheldon>佩妮别放弃啊  这个你猜的出
<1-14,Sheldon>Penny, don't give up, you can get this.

29
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,320
<1-15,Leonard>你不跟谢尔顿一起去吗
<1-15,Leonard>Aren't you going with Sheldon?

30
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,190
<1-16,Amy>不了  我对火车模型
<1-16,Amy>No, I have no interest in model trains,

31
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:42,400
<1-16,Amy>火车模型商店和令店主崩溃的老主顾都不感兴趣
<1-16,Amy>stores that sell them, nor their heartbreaking clientele.

32
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,690
<1-17,Leonard>我还有点工作要做  所以...
<1-17,Leonard>Well, I have some work to do, so...

33
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:48,970
<1-18,Amy>我不觉得那会妨碍到我
<1-18,Amy>I can't imagine that would disturb me.

34
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:50,330
<1-18,Amy>你继续
<1-18,Amy>Carry on.

35
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,390
<1-18,Amy>好吧
<1-18,Amy>Okay.

36
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,550
<1-19,Leonard>你在自己家不会更自在些吗
<1-19,Leonard>Wouldn't you be more comfortable at home?

37
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:01,980
<1-20,Amy>不觉得  不会
<1-20,Amy>Not really, no.

38
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,480
<1-21,Leonard>那好吧
<1-21,Leonard>All righty then.

39
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,660
<1-21,Leonard>我猜我现在要开始干活了
<1-21,Leonard>Guess I'll just get started.

40
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,940
<1-22,Amy>莱纳德  拜托  我不需要实况报道
<1-22,Amy>Leonard, please. I don't need the running commentary.

50
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:54,920
<2-2,Amy>-艾米  -在
<2-2,Amy>- Amy?   - Yo.

51
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,450
<2-3,Leonard>你还好吗
<2-3,Leonard>You okay?

52
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:59,040
<2-4,Amy>当然
<2-4,Amy>Oh, sure.

53
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,220
<2-5,Leonard>我以为你在读书呢
<2-5,Leonard>I thought you were reading.

54
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,360
<2-6,Amy>之前在读
<2-6,Amy>I was.

55
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,820
<2-6,Amy>现在我在思索之前读的内容
<2-6,Amy>Now I'm thinking about what I read.

56
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,410
<2-6,Amy>你还好吗  莱纳德
<2-6,Amy>You all right, Leonard?

57
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:22,380
<2-6,Amy>你看起来坐立不安
<2-6,Amy>You seem very uncomfortable.

58
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,110
<2-7,Leonard>我...  我很好
<2-7,Leonard>I-I'm fine.

59
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,660
<2-8,Amy>我是不是该离开了
<2-8,Amy>Should I go?

60
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,520
<2-8,Amy>我有时会被告知自己作客时间过久
<2-8,Amy>I've been told sometimes I overstay my welcome.

61
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,060
<2-9,Leonard>谁...  谁跟你这么说过呀
<2-9,Leonard>Wha... who told you that?

62
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:37,530
<2-10,Amy>最近一次是我的妇科医生
<2-10,Amy>Well, most recently my gynecologist.

63
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:45,130
<2-11,Leonard>你想待多久就待多久
<2-11,Leonard>Well, you stay as long as you'd like.

64
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:47,210
<2-12,Amy>我很高兴听到你这么说
<2-12,Amy>I'm glad to hear you say that,

65
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:49,570
<2-12,Amy>因为我现在待的很开心
<2-12,Amy>because I'm having a wonderful time.

66
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:54,310
<2-12,Amy>我跟我妇科医生也这么说
<2-12,Amy>I said the same thing to my gynecologist.

67
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:01,720
<3-1,Bernadette>你打算去商店里买点什么呢  谢尔顿
<3-1,Bernadette>What are you going to get at the train store, Sheldon?

68
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,630
<3-2,Sheldon>我什么都不打算买
<3-2,Sheldon>Oh, I'm not buying anything.

69
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:05,830
<3-2,Sheldon>它们那儿要办一个讲座
<3-2,Sheldon>They're having a lecture.

70
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,800
<3-2,Sheldon>"HO轨距的铁路发展
<3-2,Sheldon>"H-O gauge railroading.

72
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,530
<3-2,Sheldon>O轨距一半的尺寸  却能带来双倍的欢乐"
<3-2,Sheldon>Half the size of O-gauge, but twice the fun."

73
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:14,330
<3-2,Sheldon>非常有争议性的题目
<3-2,Sheldon>Very controversial topic.

74
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,130
<3-3,Howard>你支持哪一种轨距呢
<3-3,Howard>Which side do you come down on?

75
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:18,730
<3-4,Sheldon>今晚过后我会让你知道
<3-4,Sheldon>I'll let you know after tonight.

76
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:21,900
<3-4,Sheldon>不像某些人  起码我会带着开放的态度去听
<3-4,Sheldon>Unlike some people, I'm going in with an open mind.

77
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,420
<3-4,Sheldon>不过这不是玩笑嘛
<3-4,Sheldon>Who am I kidding?

78
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:26,260
<3-4,Sheldon>显而易见  O轨距铁路  舍O其谁
<3-4,Sheldon>Of course we all know it's O-gauge or no gauge.

79
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:31,680
<3-5,Howard>你能相信一个成年男性还坐在那玩玩具火车吗
<3-5,Howard>Can you believe grown men sit around and play with toy trains?

80
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,760
<3-6,Bernadette>对于一位自己的母亲家中
<3-6,Bernadette>That's pretty big talk for a man

81
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:36,140
<3-6,Bernadette>还藏着满柜子的魔术把戏的男人而言  那算很成熟了
<3-6,Bernadette>with a closet full of magic tricks at his mother's house.

82
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,400
<3-7,Howard>首先  那不是把戏  那都是我的"幻想"
<3-7,Howard>First of all, they're not tricks, they're illusions.

83
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,960
<3-7,Howard>其次...
<3-7,Howard>And...

84
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:44,760
<3-7,Howard>其次  当我们结婚后  那些玩意都会被
<3-7,Howard>secondly, when we get married, they're all going up

85
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:48,740
<3-7,Howard>扔进阁楼里  这样你就能有衣柜放衣服了
<3-7,Howard>in the attic so you can have that closet for clothes.

86
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:51,340
<3-8,Bernadette>我为何要放衣服在你妈妈的房子里
<3-8,Bernadette>Why would I keep clothes at your mother's house?

87
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:52,390
<3-9,Howard>你也别这么想嘛
<3-9,Howard>Well, don't think of it that way.

88
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:55,020
<3-9,Howard>我们搬进去后  那就是我们的房子了
<3-9,Howard>Once we move in, it'll be our house.

89
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,330
<3-10,Bernadette>你妈会搬出来吗
<3-10,Bernadette>Is she moving out?

90
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:56,980
<3-11,Howard>她为何要搬啊
<3-11,Howard>Why would she move out?

91
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,610
<3-11,Howard>那是她的房子啊
<3-11,Howard>It's her house.

92
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:01,680
<3-12,Bernadette>你等等
<3-12,Bernadette>Hang on.

93
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,170
<3-12,Bernadette>你难道真以为我会同意和你妈妈住一起吗
<3-12,Bernadette>You seriously think I'm going to live with your mother?

94
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,940
<3-13,Sheldon>霍华德  我想这个问题我可以回答
<3-13,Sheldon>Howard, I think I can help here.

95
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:09,220
<3-13,Sheldon>是的  伯纳黛特  他就是这么想的
<3-13,Sheldon>Yes, Bernadette, that's exactly what he thinks.

96
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,430
<3-14,Howard>为何不住一起呢
<3-14,Howard>Why not?

97
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:12,290
<3-14,Howard>那是个好房子  很多屋子
<3-14,Howard>It's a great house, plenty of room,

98
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:14,260
<3-14,Howard>如果我们有了孩子  我妈妈还能帮忙
<3-14,Howard>and if we have kids, Mom's there to help.

99
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,410
<3-14,Howard>当然  当她讲"三只小猪"的故事时
<3-14,Howard>You know, when she tells "The Three Little Pigs" story,

100
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:19,750
<3-14,Howard>她的下巴上是真的有胡子的
<3-14,Howard>she actually has hair on her chinny-chin-chin.

101
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,770
<3-15,Bernadette>我才不和你妈住一起呢
<3-15,Bernadette>I'm not gonna live with your mother.

102
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:25,670
<3-15,Bernadette>现在不会  以后也不会
<3-15,Bernadette>Not now, not ever.

103
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:29,330
<3-16,Howard>显然是有人和妈咪相处得不好
<3-16,Howard>Wow, someone obviously has some mommy issues.

104
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,710
<3-17,Bernadette>拉杰  送我回家
<3-17,Bernadette>Raj, take me home.

105
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:34,990
<3-18,Howard>别听她的  去电影院
<3-18,Howard>Don't listen to her. Go to the movie theater.

106
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:36,470
<3-19,Bernadette>赶紧送我回家
<3-19,Bernadette>Take me home now.

107
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,240
<3-20,Howard>去电影院
<3-20,Howard>Movie theater!

108
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,810
<3-22,Sheldon>好了  大家都冷静点
<3-22,Sheldon>Okay, everybody calm down.

109
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:42,470
<3-22,Sheldon>解决方法很简单
<3-22,Sheldon>There is a simple solution here.

110
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:44,530
<3-22,Sheldon>拉杰  带我去火车玩具店
<3-22,Sheldon>Raj, take me to the train store,

111
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:47,320
<3-22,Sheldon>然后你们爱干吗干吗去吧
<3-22,Sheldon>and then I don't care what you people do.

112
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,540
<4-1,Amy>冲凉可舒爽
<4-1,Amy>How was your shower?

113
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,300
<4-2,Leonard>不错  不错
<4-2,Leonard>It was good, good.

114
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,990
<4-2,Leonard>好奇问一句  你平时都几点睡觉呀
<4-2,Leonard>Just out of curiosity, what time do you usually go to bed?

116
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:03,070
<4-3,Amy>我整晚都不睡的
<4-3,Amy>Oh, I'm up all night.

118
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:05,050
<4-3,Amy>我是个夜猫子
<4-3,Amy>I'm like a possum.

119
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,130
<4-3,Amy>你高中的时候不讨人喜欢  对吧
<4-3,Amy>Boy, you were not liked in high school, were you?

120
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,350
<4-3,Amy>还好吧
<4-3,Amy>Not really.

121
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:13,390
<4-4,Leonard>那是我的高中年鉴吗
<4-4,Leonard>Is that my yearbook?

122
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:15,440
<4-5,Amy>亲爱的莱纳德  你很擅长科学
<4-5,Amy>"Dear Leonard, you're really good at science.

123
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,500
<4-5,Amy>也许有天你能发明出
<4-5,Amy>Maybe one day you'll come up

124
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,600
<4-5,Amy>治疗呆子的良药
<4-5,Amy>with a cure for being a dork".

126
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,590
<4-6,Leonard>这至少不是
<4-6,Leonard>Well, it wasn't spray-painting a Lightning Bolt

127
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:24,090
<4-6,Leonard>牛头不对马嘴的
<4-6,Leonard>on my briefcase, I can tell you that.

128
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,190
<4-7,Amy>作为安慰  我可以告诉你
<4-7,Amy>If it makes you feel any better,

129
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:28,740
<4-7,Amy>唯一一个在我高中年鉴上留言的人是我妈
<4-7,Amy>the only person who signed my yearbook was my mother.

130
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:30,730
<4-9,Amy>亲爱的艾米
<4-9,Amy>"Dear Amy,

131

<8-5,Amy>socially-approved copulation ahead of them.

246
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,880
<8-5,Amy>在某些文化习俗里  我们要站在洞房外
<8-5,Amy>In some cultures, we'd stand outside of their bedroom

247
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,570
<8-5,Amy>欢呼他们达到高潮
<8-5,Amy>cheering as they achieved orgasm.

248
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,890
<8-6,Leonard>这听起来要搞到很晚
<8-6,Leonard>That sounds like a late night,

249
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:15,040
<8-6,Leonard>而我第二天一早要工作  所以...
<8-6,Leonard>and I have work in the morning, so...

250
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:17,780
<8-7,Amy>莱纳德  也许你没注意到
<8-7,Amy>Leonard, you may not have noticed,

251
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:20,140
<8-7,Amy>但我在努力逗你开心
<8-7,Amy>but I am being a delight here.

252
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,620
<8-7,Amy>而你却觉得待不下去了
<8-7,Amy>And you're not holding up your end of the evening.

253
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:26,140
<8-8,Leonard>不好意思  只是这场婚礼让我想起
<8-8,Leonard>Oh, sorry. This wedding just reminds me

254
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:29,830
<8-8,Leonard>我那所谓的远在天边的女朋友
<8-8,Leonard>of my kinda-sorta girlfriend 9,000 miles away.

255
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:32,590
<8-9,Amy>我那个所谓的男朋友  现在正沉迷于玩具火车中
<8-9,Amy>I have a kinda-sorta boyfriend who's playing with a model train right now,

256
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:34,760
<8-9,Amy>我还没跟你吐槽呢
<8-9,Amy>you don't hear me bitching about it.

257
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,000
<8-9,Amy>莱纳德  友情提示一下  装忧郁
<8-9,Amy>Leonard, a word of advice-- moody self-obsession

258
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,970
<8-9,Amy>只适合那些玩吉他
<8-9,Amy>is only attractive in men who can play guitar

259
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,720
<8-9,Amy>跟身高比你有优势的男生
<8-9,Amy>and are considerably taller than you.

260
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,110
<8-10,Leonard>我不忧郁
<8-10,Leonard>I'm not moody.

261
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:48,560
<8-10,Leonard>我很风趣
<8-10,Leonard>I'm fun.

262
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,940
<8-11,Amy>那你有什么证据证明吗
<8-11,Amy>You have any evidence to support that statement?

263
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,280
<8-12,Leonard>我就和你一样风趣
<8-12,Leonard>Well, hey, I'm just as much fun as you are.

264
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,140
<8-13,Amy>是吗  你会在手指上画个小胡子
<8-13,Amy>Really? Are you willing to draw a mustache on your finger

265
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:59,570
<8-13,Amy>用来活跃气氛吗
<8-13,Amy>as a conversational icebreaker?

266
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,100
<8-13,Amy>我就会
<8-13,Amy>I am.

267
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,560
<8-14,Leonard>好吧  你有什么建议
<8-14,Leonard>Okay, fine, what do you suggest?

268
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:10,850
<8-15,Amy>我们刚刚大吃了一顿
<8-15,Amy>We just had a lovely meal,

269
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:14,050
<8-15,Amy>而现在乐队正嗨得火热
<8-15,Amy>the band... is on fire...

270
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,360
<8-15,Amy>你旁边是位漂亮的女士
<8-15,Amy>and you're sitting next to a beautiful woman

271
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,320
<8-15,Amy>还浓妆艳抹地涂得像个妓女
<8-15,Amy>wearing whorish makeup.

272
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,780
<8-15,Amy>我们干嘛不去跳个舞
<8-15,Amy>Why don't we head out on the dance floor

273
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:24,430
<8-15,Amy>看我能不能跳得一身湿
<8-15,Amy>and see if I can sweat through these dress shields.

274
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:27,830
<8-16,Leonard>再强调一下  我真的不擅长跳舞
<8-16,Leonard>Once again, I-I'm really not much of a dancer.

275
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:29,480
<8-17,Amy>别担心
<8-17,Amy>Don't worry...

<9-4,Howard>Yeah, she sometimes has problems doing her business. Hang on.

283
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:18,790
<9-4,Howard>妈  放弃吧
<9-4,Howard>Ma, give up!

284

00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,460
<9-10,Howard>没事的  亲爱的
<9-10,Howard>Oh, come on, honey.

<9-10,Howard>她只是坐那看杂志罢了
<9-10,Howard>She's just sitting in there reading a magazine.

294
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:44,850
<9-10,Howard>你什么都看不到的
<9-10,Howard>You can't see anything.

295
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,910
<9-10,Howard>我向来都是直接进去的
<9-10,Howard>I go in all the time.

296
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,450
<9-11,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>哈哈  "鹰"总算降落了
<9-11,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>Ha! The eagle has landed!

00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:57,680
<9-12,Howard>而且是降落在"大海"中
<9-12,Howard>And we have splashdown.

299
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,760
<9-12,Howard>稍等下啊  我去点蜡烛
<9-12,Howard>Wait here, I'm gonna go light a candle.

300
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,110
<9-12,Howard>然后我们来激情爱爱
<9-12,Howard>And then we make passionate love.

301
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:14,400
<10-1,Amy>快了  马上到了
<10-1,Amy>There we go, last floor.

302
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,800
<10-2,Leonard>我真不明白怎么回事
<10-2,Leonard>I just can't figure out what happened.

303
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,580
<10-2,Leonard>我把左腿放进去  再拿出来
<10-2,Leonard>I put my left leg in, I took my left leg out,

304
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:22,750
<10-2,Leonard>再放进去  然后什么东西就噼啪乱响
<10-2,Leonard>I put my left leg in, and something just snapped.

305
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,890
<10-3,Amy>变戏法不适合你这老胳膊老腿了
<10-3,Amy>The hokey pokey is a young man's game.

306
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:28,300
<10-4,Leonard>今晚真的很开心
<10-4,Leonard>I did have a great time.

307
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,810
<10-4,Leonard>谢谢你提醒我
<10-4,Leonard>Thank you for reminding me

308
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:32,210
<10-4,Leonard>偶尔找找乐子也是可以的
<10-4,Leonard>it's okay to have fun once in a while.

309
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:33,430
<10-5,Amy>不客气
<10-5,Amy>You're welcome.

310
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:35,370
<10-6,Leonard>再谢谢你掰下冰天鹅的头
<10-6,Leonard>And also for breaking the head off the ice swan

311
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:38,310
<10-6,Leonard>让我敷着拉伤的腹股沟
<10-6,Leonard>so I could hold it against my pulled groin.

312
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,120
<10-7,Amy>我擅长空间推理
<10-7,Amy>I excel at spatial reasoning,

313
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,070
<10-7,Amy>当时预感到天鹅脖子那优美的弧度
<10-7,Amy>and I had a hunch that the graceful slope of its neck

314
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:44,650
<10-7,Amy>能恰好做你生殖器的支架
<10-7,Amy>would cradle your genitals nicely.

315
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,260
<10-8,Leonard>明白  再次感谢
<10-8,Leonard>Well, okay. Again, thank you.

316
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,740
<10-9,Amy>再次不用谢
<10-9,Amy>And again, you're welcome.

317

<10-10,Leonard>想进来喝杯茶吗
<10-10,Leonard>Want to come in, have a cup of tea?

318
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,890
<10-11,Amy>不用了  谢谢  我该回家了
<10-11,Amy>No, thanks. I'm gonna head home.

319
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:58,360
<10-12,Leonard>好吧  晚安
<10-12,Leonard>'Kay. Well, good night.

320
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,980
<10-13,Amy>晚安

<10-14,Penny>小米  嗨  婚礼怎样
<10-14,Penny>Ames, hi. How was the wedding?

322
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:14,190
<10-15,Amy>棒极了  直到我不小心让莱纳德爱上我
<10-15,Amy>Great. Until I accidentally made Leonard fall in love with me.

323
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,000
<10-16,Penny>进来吧  我们得聊聊
<10-16,Penny>Come in, let's talk.

324
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:22,810
<10-16,Penny>想来杯酒吗
<10-16,Penny>Do you want a glass of wine?

325
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:24,740
<10-17,Amy>酒就是我陷入此困境的罪魁之一
<10-17,Amy>Wine is one of the reasons I'm in this fix.

326
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:27,020
<10-17,Amy>还有个祸首就是这该死的骨盆
<10-17,Amy>That and this dang pelvis.

327
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,400
<10-18,Penny>好吧  抱歉  到底怎么回事
<10-18,Penny>Okay, I'm sorry, what exactly happened?

328
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,420
<10-19,Amy>这是不可避免的
<10-19,Amy>The inevitable--

329
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,680
<10-19,Amy>他思念女友  孤独又脆弱
<10-19,Amy>he was lonely and vulnerable from missing his girlfriend,

330
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,550
<10-19,Amy>而我迷人又支持他
<10-19,Amy>while I was charming, supportive

331
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,130
<10-19,Amy>还有  面对现实吧  穿着这身裙子
<10-19,Amy>and, let's face it, in this dress,

332
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:41,170
<10-19,Amy>我就是麦当娜和浪女的绝妙组合
<10-19,Amy>the perfect combination of Madonna and whore.

333
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,580
<10-20,Penny>天哪  他对你下手了吗
<10-20,Penny>Oh, God, did he make a move on you?

334
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,940
<10-21,Amy>没  但这只是时间问题
<10-21,Amy>No, but it's only a matter of time.

335
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,040
<10-21,Amy>我怎么会没早料到呢
<10-21,Amy>How could I have not seen this coming?

336
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,050
<10-21,Amy>现在我得伤了这小糊涂虫的心了
<10-21,Amy>Now I'm gonna have to break the little sad sack's heart.

337
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:55,550
<10-22,Penny>没事  我相信他挺得过去
<10-22,Penny>Yeah, I'm sure he'll be okay.

338
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,360
<10-23,Amy>佩妮  我最多只是知道
<10-23,Amy>Oh, Penny, much as I would treasure knowing that

339
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,240
<10-23,Amy>我们俩被同一个男人玷污了
<10-23,Amy>the two of us had been defiled by the same man,

340
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,670
<10-23,Amy>莱纳德完全提不起我的性致
<10-23,Amy>Leonard just doesn't get my motor running.

341
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,770
<10-24,Penny>那你想怎么做呢
<10-24,Penny>So, um, what are you gonna do?

342
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:10,820
<10-24,Penny>你想让我去告诉莱纳德  让他好受点吗
<10-24,Penny>Do you want me to talk to Leonard, let him down easy?

343
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:13,050
<10-25,Amy>不  就让他痴心妄想一晚吧
<10-25,Amy>No. I'll let him have tonight.

344
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:14,510
<10-25,Amy>然后明天早上
<10-25,Amy>Then in the morning,

345
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:15,790
<10-25,Amy>我会给他发电邮  让他知道
<10-25,Amy>I'll send him an e-mail letting him know

346
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:18,620
<10-25,Amy>这具身体无法成为他的极乐仙境
<10-25,Amy>this body is never gonna be his wonderland.

347
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:23,310
<10-25,Amy>老实说  你的机会还比他大呢
<10-25,Amy>I mean, frankly, you've got a better shot than he does.

348
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,140
<10-25,Amy>莱纳德
<10-25,Amy>Leonard.

<11-1,Sheldon>Half the size of H-O.

354
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,540
<11-1,Sheldon>看  正好能放我嘴里
<11-1,Sheldon>Look, it fits in my mouth.

<11-2,Leonard>看来你今晚过得很愉快

<11-5,Sheldon>What exactly do you mean by that?
