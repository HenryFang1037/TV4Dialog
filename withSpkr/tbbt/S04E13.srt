6
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:20,380
<1-2,Sheldon>比如  "谁把狗放出来了"
<1-2,Sheldon>as "Who let the dogs out?"

7
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:22,380
<1-2,Sheldon>还有"他们过得如何"

00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:40,350

100
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:43,350
<3-6,Penny>你和谢尔顿要共住一间房吗
<3-6,Penny>are you and Sheldon going to be sharing a room?

101
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,280
<3-7,Amy>不  我们讨论过了
<3-7,Amy>No, we discussed it.

102
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,540
<3-7,Amy>一致认为  我们不想因为太了解对方
<3-7,Amy>We decided we didn't want to jeopardize our relationship

103
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,480
<3-7,Amy>而损害了我们的关系
<3-7,Amy>by getting to know each other too well.

104
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:52,800
<3-8,Sheldon>确实  没有比熟知对方的如厕规律
<3-8,Sheldon>Indeed. Nothing sours a friendship more

105
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,210
<3-8,Sheldon>更破坏友情的事了
<3-8,Sheldon>than over-familiarity with someone's toilet routine.

106
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,500
<3-9,Leonard>我深表赞同
<3-9,Leonard>I can vouch for that.

112
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,600
<3-14,Amy>另外  旅行会让我便秘
<3-14,Amy>And FYI, travel makes me constipated

<6-1,Penny>也不是啥"汽车旅行之王"啦
<6-1,Penny>It's not technically "Road Trip God""

158
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:04,160
<6-2,Howard>是旅途监督员
<6-2,Howard>it's Travel Supervisor.

159
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,500
<5-14,Sheldon>尽管汽车旅行之王听着更拉风一些
<5-14,Sheldon>Although Road Trip God does have a certain ring to it.

160

<5-15,Penny>What's he going to do?

<6-1,Penny>真不敢相信  你们就眼看着他把我轰出来
<6-1,Penny>I can't believe you let him kick me out of the car.

<6-2,Howard>我们敢怎样啊  他是旅程监督人
<6-2,Howard>What could we do? He's the Travel Supervisor.

<8-9,Howard>I mean, there's nothing I can do here

221
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:10,570
<8-9,Howard>更..."给力"一点

227
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:26,650
<8-12,Bernadette>你不能这么想
<8-12,Bernadette>You can't think that way.

<8-16,Bernadette>等等  什么叫"我这种女孩"
<8-16,Bernadette>Wait a minute, "A girl like me"? What's that mean?

237
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,710
<8-20,Bernadette>配不上格伦吗

<9-5,Amy>你同意弗洛依德的"阴茎嫉妒"理论吗

249
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,570
<9-6,Penny>呃  我还真没想过
<9-6,Penny>Um, I never really thought about it.

00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:37,130
<9-6,Penny>怎么了
<9-6,Penny>Why?

251
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:39,420
<9-7,Amy>有时候我觉得长一根挺不错的

<9-9,Amy>我们的内部下水系统太难伺候了
<9-9,Amy>our internal plumbing is extremely high maintenance.

256
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,880
<9-10,Penny>我也没怎么想过这个
<9-10,Penny>Again, I've never given it much thought.

267
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,530
<9-18,Amy>我跟佩妮完全不介意睡一张床
<9-18,Amy>Penny and I are perfectly comfortable sharing a bed.

268
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:20,940
<9-19,Penny>不介意吗

<9-22,Amy>I'm prone to night terrors

273
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,170
<9-22,Amy>所以如果我睁眼乱踢或尖叫  别慌
<9-22,Amy>so when I wake up kicking and screaming, don't panic.

274
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:33,850
<9-22,Amy>把我按倒抚摸我的头发  就会没事的
<9-22,Amy>Just pin me down and stroke my hair, and I'll be fine.

<10-11,Penny>我们得充分利用这个情况

356
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:54,450
<13-1,Sheldon>我的神呐  是吧
<13-1,Sheldon>OMG, right?

357
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,710
<13-1,Sheldon>也许这个笑话对于在座各位有点儿太弱智了
<13-1,Sheldon>Perhaps that joke was a little too hippie-dippy for this crowd.

358
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:03,060
<13-1,Sheldon>好了  我们开始致开幕词
<13-1,Sheldon>All right then, we'll begin with opening remarks.

359
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:06,500
<13-1,Sheldon>罗斯顿考斯基小姐  你愿意抛砖引玉
<13-1,Sheldon>Miss Rostenkowski, would you like to start us off

360
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:08,340
<13-1,Sheldon>谈谈你对于
<13-1,Sheldon>by discussing your assessment

361
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:11,230
<13-1,Sheldon>科学对社会的责任的看法吗
<13-1,Sheldon>of science's responsibility to society?

362
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,160
<13-1,Sheldon>好的
<13-1,Sheldon>Sure.

363
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:14,450
<13-2,Bernadette>我认为  每一个自然学科
<13-2,Bernadette>I think all branches of science

364
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,400
<13-2,Bernadette>在今天都需要谨慎发展
<13-2,Bernadette>have to move cautiously these days.

365
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,690
<13-2,Bernadette>能毁灭世界的
<13-2,Bernadette>It's not just giant nuclear weapons

366
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:20,260
<13-2,Bernadette>并不只有大型的核武器
<13-2,Bernadette>that can destroy the world.

367
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:22,100
<13-2,Bernadette>作为一名微生物学家  我可以告诉你
<13-2,Bernadette>As a microbiologist, I can tell you

368
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:26,440
<13-2,Bernadette>即使是最微小的微生物也能让你尸骨无存
<13-2,Bernadette>even the tiniest organisms can still tear you a new one.

369
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:31,120
<13-3,Howard>有意思
<13-3,Howard>Interesting.

370
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,800
<13-3,Howard>我觉得在座各位需要了解我同事的一点
<13-3,Howard>I think what you might need to know about my colleague

371
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,940
<13-3,Howard>就是尽管她声称
<13-3,Howard>is that though she claims

372
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:39,170
<13-3,Howard>她最感兴趣的领域是细小的微生物
<13-3,Howard>her field of interest is tiny organisms

373
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:42,150
<13-3,Howard>她显然在我们可以认为是大型武器的东西上
<13-3,Howard>she certainly has spent her fair share of time

374
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:46,280
<13-3,Howard>花了相当多的时间
<13-3,Howard>around what we can assume was pretty massive weaponry.

375
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,840
<13-4,Bernadette>我认为沃罗威茨先生需要记住一点
<13-4,Bernadette>I think Mr. Wolowitz needs to keep in mind

376
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,860
<13-4,Bernadette>那就是过去的事情已经过去了
<13-4,Bernadette>that the past is the past.

377
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:56,220
<13-4,Bernadette>但他应该知道我是那种
<13-4,Bernadette>But he should know that I am the kind of girl

378
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:59,800
<13-4,Bernadette>让任何"大型导弹"趋之若鹜的女孩
<13-4,Bernadette>who could get all the giant missiles she wants.

379
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,940
<13-5,Amy>我们在讨论女性对阴茎的渴求吗
<13-5,Amy>Are we talking about women wanting penises?

380
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,680
<13-5,Amy>因为我想插一句嘴
<13-5,Amy>Because I'd like to weigh in.

381
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,790
<13-6,Sheldon>库萨帕里博士  你想说几句吗
<13-6,Sheldon>Dr. Koothrappali, would you care to join the conversation?

382
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,220
<13-7,Raj>当然  我有两点要讲
<13-7,Raj>Certainly. I'd like to raise two points.

383
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:23,950
<13-7,Raj>第一  我觉得他们确实在讨论小弟弟
<13-7,Raj>Number one, I think they are talking about penises.

384
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,120
<13-7,Raj>第二  这桔汁他妈的香槟太他妈的爽了
<13-7,Raj>And number two, these mimosas are kicking my little brown ass.

385
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,300
<13-8,Leonard>我真他妈的想他妈的踹你
<13-8,Leonard>I'd like to kick your little brown ass.

386
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,380
<13-9,Raj>我干啥了
<13-9,Raj>What did I do?

387
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,830
<13-9,Raj>我不知道诶
<13-9,Raj>Oh, I don't know.

388
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,590
<13-10,Leonard>也许当你走进一间酒店房间
<13-10,Leonard>Maybe when you walk into a hotel room

389
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:42,840
<13-10,Leonard>看见一哥们儿跟女朋友重归于好时
<13-10,Leonard>and you see a guy getting back together with his girlfriend

390
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,990
<13-10,Leonard>你应该考虑做点儿别的什么
<13-10,Leonard>you should consider doing something other

391
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:47,620
<13-10,Leonard>而不是爬到旁边的床上
<13-10,Leonard>than crawling into the adjoining bed.

392
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,700
<13-11,Raj>是啊  你说了不能看《BJ单身日记》的
<13-11,Raj>I did. You said no Bridget Jones.

393
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,630
<13-12,Penny (voice)>我俩没有重归于好
<13-12,Penny (voice)>We weren't getting back together!

394
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:55,500
<13-12,Penny (voice)>只是一夜风流而已
<13-12,Penny (voice)>It was a one-time thing!

395
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:57,340
<13-13,Sheldon>对不起
<13-13,Sheldon>Excuse me.

396
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:59,180
<13-13,Sheldon>我们现在不接受
<13-13,Sheldon>We're not taking comments or questions

397
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,070
<13-13,Sheldon>观众的评论和提问
<13-13,Sheldon>from the audience just yet.

398
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,860
<13-14,Penny(voice)>闭嘴吧  谢尔顿
<13-14,Penny(voice)>Oh, shut up, Sheldon!

399
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:05,000
<13-15,Amy>-嗨  闺蜜  -嗨
<13-15,Amy>- Hi, bestie.  - Hi.

400
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,660
<13-17,Sheldon>好吧  我们为什么不试着重回正题呢
<13-17,Sheldon>All right, why don't we see if we can bring this back to topic.

401
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,280
<13-18,Howard>让我来问问你吧  妮妮
<13-18,Howard>Let me ask you something, Bernie.

402
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,620
<13-19,Sheldon>看样子不行
<13-19,Sheldon>I guess not.

403
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,000
<13-20,Howard>如果你碰到了我酷似安吉丽娜·朱莉的
<13-20,Howard>How would you feel if you met my ex-girlfriend

404
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,620
<13-20,Howard>前女友  你会作何感受
<13-20,Howard>and she was like Angelina Jolie?

405
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:21,270
<13-21,Bernadette>拜托  霍华德  别做梦了
<13-21,Bernadette>Oh, come on, Howard, be realistic.

406
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,420
<13-22,Howard>怎么  如此英俊的我难道钓不到安吉丽娜·朱莉吗
<13-22,Howard>What, I'm not hot enough for Angelina Jolie?

407
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,320
<13-23,Raj>我想插句嘴
<13-23,Raj>I'd like to weigh in here.

408
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:32,490
<13-23,Raj>确实钓不到
<13-23,Raj>No.

409
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,570
<13-24,Sheldon>好吧  我们不如开始进入
<13-24,Sheldon>All right, why don't we open it up

410
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:37,990
<13-24,Sheldon>观众的问答环节吧
<13-24,Sheldon>to Q&A from the audience?

411
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:38,910
<13-25,Penny (voice)>好  我有问题
<13-25,Penny (voice)>Yeah, I have a question.

412
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:40,720
<13-25,Penny (voice)>有谁今晚能带我离开这鬼地方
<13-25,Penny (voice)>Is there anybody who can get me the hell out of here

413
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,700
<13-25,Penny (voice)>回洛杉矶
<13-25,Penny (voice)>and back to Los Angeles tonight?

<13-26,Glenn (voice)>我今晚开车回洛城
<13-26,Glenn (voice)>I'm driving back to L.A. tonight.

415
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:51,520
<13-27,Bernadette>佩妮  那是格伦  格伦  那是佩妮
<13-27,Bernadette>Penny, that's Glenn. Glenn, that's Penny.

416
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,580
<13-27,Bernadette>不要
<13-27,Bernadette>No!

417
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,310
<13-27,Bernadette>红1号呼叫红5号
<13-27,Bernadette>Red Leader to Red Five.

418
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:06,330
<13-27,Bernadette>红1号呼叫红5号
<13-27,Bernadette>Red Leader to Red Five.

419
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:09,940
<14-1,Sheldon (voice)>谁想玩个小游戏
<14-1,Sheldon (voice)>Anybody up for a little game?

420
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,790
<14-1,Sheldon (voice)>我心里想的是
<14-1,Sheldon (voice)>I spy with my little eye...

421
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,440
<14-1,Sheldon (voice)>一种非铁金属
<14-1,Sheldon (voice)>a nonferrous metal.

422
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,780
<15-1,Sheldon>估计是超出接收范围了
<15-1,Sheldon>Must be out of range.

423
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,430
<15-2,Amy>莱纳德  我能问你个问题吗
<15-2,Amy>Leonard, can I ask you a question?

424
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,480
<15-3,Leonard>问吧
<15-3,Leonard>Sure.

425
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:32,650
<15-4,Amy>你这么生气是不是因为你的前任女友
<15-4,Amy>Are you bothered by the fact that your former girlfriend

426
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:34,160
<15-4,Amy>和一位可能是我这辈子见过的
<15-4,Amy>left the symposium with what is probably

427
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:36,640
<15-4,Amy>最帅的男人一起离开研讨会了
<15-4,Amy>the most beautiful man I've ever seen in my life?

428
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:40,250
<15-5,Leonard>不是  你为啥这么问
<15-5,Leonard>No. Why do you ask?

429
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:43,600
<15-6,Amy>因为我们的时速达到了120英里[约193公里]
<15-6,Amy>Because we're going 120 miles per hour.

430
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:47,870
<15-7,Sheldon>好吧  如果没人想猜的话
<15-7,Sheldon>All right, if no one's going to guess...

431
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:51,570
<15-7,Sheldon>其实我想的是几英里前我们经过的
<15-7,Sheldon>I was spying the aluminum rims on the police car

432
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:53,540
<15-7,Sheldon>那辆警车的铝制轮缘
<15-7,Sheldon>we passed a few miles back.
