1
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:07,640
<1-1,Leonard>我只是想说  一部像样的《绿巨人》
<1-1,Leonard>All I'm saying is, if they took all the money they spent

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,100
<1-1,Leonard>让电影公司砸了不少钱
<1-1,Leonard>trying to make a decent Hulk movie,

3
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,550
<1-1,Leonard>他们完全可以拿这笔钱  造一个真正的绿巨人出来
<1-1,Leonard>they could probably just make an actual Hulk.

4
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:15,150
<1-2,Sheldon>这观点真是聪明又有趣
<1-2,Sheldon>That is apt and amusing.

5
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,820
<1-2,Sheldon>我应该跟艾米·菲拉·福勒分享
<1-2,Sheldon>I think I shall share that with Amy Farrah Fowler.

6
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,420
<1-2,Sheldon>她一定会欣赏你的妙语连珠
<1-2,Sheldon>She'll appreciate the witticism.

7
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,300
<1-3,Leonard>不敢当
<1-3,Leonard>Thank you.

8
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,340
<1-4,Sheldon>这同时也能改善你在她心目中的最初印象
<1-4,Sheldon>It'll also help improve her initial impression of you.

9
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,490
<1-5,Leonard>你们俩最近如何
<1-5,Leonard>So what's going on with you two?

10
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:31,320
<1-6,Sheldon>状态一直维持不变
<1-6,Sheldon>Well, the status is as it always was.

11
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,000
<1-6,Sheldon>她是位女生  她也是位朋友
<1-6,Sheldon>She's a girl. She's a friend.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,010
<1-6,Sheldon>但她不是我的
<1-6,Sheldon>She is not my--

13
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:35,620
<1-6,Sheldon>请原谅我做这个动作
<1-6,Sheldon>please forgive me for doing this--

14
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,320
<1-6,Sheldon>"女朋友"
<1-6,Sheldon>"Girlfriend."

15
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:39,580
<1-7,Leonard>好吧  好吧
<1-7,Leonard>Right, right.

16
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,970
<1-7,Leonard>所以你们一直保持在发短信和发邮件的阶段吗
<1-7,Leonard>So you're still just texting and emailing?

17
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,410
<1-7,Leonard>你难道一点也不想跟她呆在一起吗  比如
<1-7,Leonard>You don't feel any need to hang out with her, you know--

18
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:46,090
<1-7,Leonard>呆在一个房间也好啊
<1-7,Leonard>be in the same room?

19
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:48,600
<1-8,Sheldon>莱纳德  你是我最好的朋友
<1-8,Sheldon>Leonard, you are my best friend.

20
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,490
<1-8,Sheldon>我认识你整整七年了
<1-8,Sheldon>I've known you for seven years,

21
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:53,870
<1-8,Sheldon>而我却还难以忍受  咱俩同坐在一个沙发上这个事实
<1-8,Sheldon>and I can barely tolerate sitting on the couch with you.

22
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,050
<1-8,Sheldon>你就可以想象得到
<1-8,Sheldon>Imagine my attitude regarding

23
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:59,710
<1-8,Sheldon>我对与艾米·菲拉·福勒长时间身体接触的态度了
<1-8,Sheldon>prolonged physical proximity to Amy Farrah Fowler.

24
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,610
<1-9,Leonard>明白了
<1-9,Leonard>Got it.

25
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:03,690
<1-10,Sheldon>我感觉你有意见
<1-10,Sheldon>I sense judgment on your part.

26
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,490
<1-10,Sheldon>没有  哪有
<1-10,Sheldon>No, no.

27
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,390
<1-11,Leonard>或许有那么一点儿吧
<1-11,Leonard>Maybe a little.

28
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:12,240
<1-12,Sheldon>我可以认为你的批评是基于嫉妒吗
<1-12,Sheldon>May I suggest that your criticism is based on jealousy.

29
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,960
<1-13,Leonard>嫉妒  有什么值得让我嫉妒的
<1-13,Leonard>Jealousy? What do I have to be jealous of?

30
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,740
<1-14,Sheldon>我与一位女性有一段运行良好且令人满意的关系
<1-14,Sheldon>I have a functioning and satisfying relationship with a female.

31
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,390
<1-14,Sheldon>而你没有
<1-14,Sheldon>You have none.

32
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:24,700
<1-15,Leonard>被你说中了
<1-15,Leonard>Oh, right. That.

33
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,080
<1-16,Sheldon>嫉妒是一个丑陋的  眼发绿光的怪物
<1-16,Sheldon>Jealousy is an ugly green-eyed monster--

34
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,460
<1-16,Sheldon>跟绿巨人浩克一样
<1-16,Sheldon>not unlike the Hulk--

35
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:31,240
<1-16,Sheldon>随便说一下  人家也是有女朋友的
<1-16,Sheldon>who, by the way, also has a girlfriend.

36
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,650
<1-16,Sheldon>在这段重播里  妮弗·康纳利
<1-16,Sheldon>In this iteration, Jennifer Connelly,

37
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:36,200
<1-16,Sheldon>或许你记得的版本是《美丽心灵》里
<1-16,Sheldon>whom you may recall as the girlfriend of Russell Crowe

38
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,430
<1-16,Sheldon>罗素·克洛的女朋友
<1-16,Sheldon>in A Beautiful Mind,

39
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:40,360
<1-16,Sheldon>说不定都和绿巨人共赴巫山了
<1-16,Sheldon>a feel-good romp if there ever was one.

40
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:43,570
<1-17,Leonard>我才没有嫉妒
<1-17,Leonard>I'm not jealous.

41
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,820
<1-18,Sheldon>莱纳德一点儿也不嫉妒
<1-18,Sheldon>Leonard not jealous.

42
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,010
<1-18,Sheldon>生活大爆炸
<1-18,Sheldon>第四季第五集

43
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,920
<2-1,Sheldon>我刚想到一件事
<2-1,Sheldon>You know, it just occurred to me,

44
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,280
<2-1,Sheldon>如果存在千万个平行宇宙
<2-1,Sheldon>if there are an infinite number of parallel universes,

45
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,070
<2-1,Sheldon>在其中的一个  那里很可能有一位谢尔顿
<2-1,Sheldon>in one of them, there's probably a Sheldon

46
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:25,080
<2-1,Sheldon>他根本不相信有平行宇宙的存在
<2-1,Sheldon>who doesn't believe parallel universes exist.

47
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,880
<2-2,Leonard>很可能  你的重点是什么
<2-2,Leonard>Probably. What's your point?

48
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,750
<2-3,Sheldon>没重点
<2-3,Sheldon>No point.

49
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:29,920
<2-3,Sheldon>这只是让千万个我中的某我
<2-3,Sheldon>It's just one of the things

50
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,470
<2-3,Sheldon>发笑的理由之一
<2-3,Sheldon>that makes one of the mes chuckle.

51
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,350
<2-3,Sheldon>莱纳德  什么事会让你发笑
<2-3,Sheldon>What makes you chuckle, Leonard?

52
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:38,670
<2-4,Leonard>最近吗
<2-4,Leonard>Hmm, recently?

53
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:39,880
<2-4,Leonard>不是很多
<2-4,Leonard>Not much.

54
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,870
<2-5,Sheldon>是因为那场争端吗  起因于
<2-5,Sheldon>Is it because of the conflict that arises

55
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,210
<2-5,Sheldon>你极其需要与一个女人建立对偶关系
<2-5,Sheldon>from your desperate need to pair-bond with a woman,

56
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:46,640
<2-5,Sheldon>而显然所有的女性做出的决定
<2-5,Sheldon>and the apparent collective decision of all womankind

57
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,860
<2-5,Sheldon>都是否决了你
<2-5,Sheldon>to deny you that opportunity?

58
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,740
<2-6,Leonard>呃
<2-6,Leonard>Um...

59
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,580
<2-6,Leonard>你还是把嘴闭上吧
<2-6,Leonard>Shut up.

60
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,010
<2-7,Sheldon>当我爷爷过世之后
<2-7,Sheldon>You know, when my grandfather died,

61
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,800
<2-7,Sheldon>剩奶奶独自一人  我妈妈就安排
<2-7,Sheldon>and Meemaw was alone, my mom arranged for her

62
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,720
<2-7,Sheldon>让她一周去三次活动中心
<2-7,Sheldon>to visit a center three times a week

63
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,960
<2-7,Sheldon>在那里  她可以与同样孤独的人交流
<2-7,Sheldon>where she could socialize with other lonely people.

64
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,580
<2-7,Sheldon>这个安排非常好
<2-7,Sheldon>It's very nice.

65
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:10,370
<2-7,Sheldon>他们讨论时事  玩桥牌  吃热乎乎的饭
<2-7,Sheldon>They discuss current events, play bridge, get a hot meal.

66
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:11,960
<2-8,Leonard>听起来不错
<2-8,Leonard>That sounds lovely.

67
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,890
<2-9,Sheldon>如果你喜欢玩桥牌的话
<2-9,Sheldon>It is if you like bridge.

68
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,980
<2-9,Sheldon>你喜欢玩桥牌吗  莱纳德
<2-9,Sheldon>Do you like bridge, Leonard?

69
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:20,260
<2-10,Leonard>谢尔顿  我只是现在没有人约会而已
<2-10,Leonard>Sheldon, I'm just not dating someone right now.

70
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,760
<2-10,Leonard>不用把我送到老年活动中心吧
<2-10,Leonard>I don't need to go to a senior center.

71
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,320
<2-11,Sheldon>奶奶一开始也是拒绝  但后来她欲罢不能
<2-11,Sheldon>Meemaw resisted at first, but now she loves it.

72
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,330
<2-12,Leonard>好  如果我最近还没碰到合适的人
<2-12,Leonard>Fine. If I don't meet someone soon,

73
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:31,120
<2-12,Leonard>你就把我送去养老院得了
<2-12,Leonard>you can put me in a home.

74
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:32,990
<2-13,Sheldon>那不是养老院
<2-13,Sheldon>It's not a home.

75
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:35,580
<2-13,Sheldon>是老年人活动中心
<2-13,Sheldon>It's a senior center.

76
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,230
<2-13,Sheldon>我们绝不会把奶奶送到养老院
<2-13,Sheldon>We'd never put Meemaw in a home!

77
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:40,470
<3-1,Leonard>嗨  大家好啊
<3-1,Leonard>Hey, guys.

78
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,850
<3-2,Howard>-嗨  -嗨
<3-2,Howard>- Hey.  - Hey.

79
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:44,830
<3-4,Sheldon>我屈服于社交的压力  跟你们打声招呼吧
<3-4,Sheldon>All right, I'll bow to social pressure: Hey!

80
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:49,460
<3-5,Howard (phone rings)>抱歉  我女朋友伯纳黛特打来的
<3-5,Howard (phone rings)>Excuse me. That's my girlfriend, Bernadette.

81
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,070
<3-5,Howard (phone rings)>我给她设了专门的铃声
<3-5,Howard (phone rings)>I assigned her her own ringtone--

82
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:53,080
<3-5,Howard (phone rings)>用的“四顶尖”唱的《伯纳黛特》
<3-5,Howard (phone rings)>"Bernadette," By The Four Tops.

83
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,180
<3-5,Howard (phone rings)>伯纳黛特  你好啊
<3-5,Howard (phone rings)>Hello, Bernadette.

84
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:59,110
<3-6,Raj>我给他打电话时  铃声是"褐眼女孩"
<3-6,Raj>When I call him, his phone plays "Brown Eyed Girl."

85
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,390
<3-6,Raj>现在回想起来  好像不是那么好了
<3-6,Raj>Which, now that I think about it, is not so good.

86
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,750
<3-7,Leonard>你应该意识到  他是在炫耀他有女朋友而咱们没有
<3-7,Leonard>You realize he's just rubbing our noses in the fact

87
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,760
<3-7,Leonard>故意让咱们不爽
<3-7,Leonard>that he has a girlfriend, and we don't.

88
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,550
<3-8,Rai>你是说  你没有吧
<3-8,Rai>You mean, you don't.

89
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:11,460
<3-9,Leonard>连你都有女朋友了
<3-9,Leonard>You have a girlfriend?

90
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,270
<3-9,Leonard>你怎么会有女朋友呢
<3-9,Leonard>How could you have a girlfriend?

91
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:13,530
<3-9,Leonard>你在女人面前连话都说不出来
<3-9,Leonard>You can't even speak to women.

92
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:16,500
<3-10,Raj>送你两个字  聋女
<3-10,Raj>Two words-- deaf chick.

93
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,210
<3-10,Raj>所以我说不说话都没关系
<3-10,Raj>It doesn't matter if I can't talk,

94
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:21,170
<3-10,Raj>因为她根本听不见
<3-10,Raj>because she can't hear me.

95
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:22,730
<3-11,Leonard>什么
<3-11,Leonard>What?

96
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,520
<3-12,Raj>这是她的原话
<3-12,Raj>That's what she said.

97
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,640
<3-13,Leonard>很好  你有女朋友  霍华德有女朋友
<3-13,Leonard>Great. You have a girlfriend, Howard's got a girlfriend,

98
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,860
<3-14,Sheldon>-谢尔顿有女  -错错错错
<3-14,Sheldon>- Sheldon's got a girl... - No, no, no, no!

99
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:30,990
<3-15,Leonard>女性朋友
<3-15,Leonard>...who's a friend.

100

<3-16,Sheldon>多谢
<3-16,Sheldon>Thank you.

101
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,530
<3-17,Leonard>你呢  斯图特
<3-17,Leonard>What about you, Stuart?

102
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:35,880
<3-17,Leonard>你有女朋友了吗

103
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,980
<3-18,Stuart>有了  有了
<3-18,Stuart>Oh, yeah. Yeah.

104
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,760
<3-18,Stuart>我们是在动漫大会上相遇的
<3-18,Stuart>I met her at Comic-Con,

105
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,100
<3-18,Stuart>那里是全世界唯一一个地方
<3-18,Stuart>the one place in the world where saying

106
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,430
<3-18,Stuart>可以用"我有一家漫画书屋"
<3-18,Stuart>"I own a comic bookstore"

107
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:43,580
<3-18,Stuart>作为真正的开场白
<3-18,Stuart>is an actual pickup line.

108
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,710
<3-19,Leonard>哇哦  恭喜你
<3-19,Leonard>Oh. Well, good for you.

109
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:47,740
<3-20,Stuart>其实她很可怕
<3-20,Stuart>Not really. She's horrible.

110
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:49,650
<3-20,Stuart>当她想做爱的时候
<3-20,Stuart>When she wants to have sex,

111
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:52,610
<3-20,Stuart>她会穿上她超大号的神奇女侠装  然后大喊
<3-20,Stuart>she puts on her plus-size Wonder Woman costume and shouts,

112
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:55,580
<3-20,Stuart>"谁想坐一下我的隐形飞机"
<3-20,Stuart>"Who wants to take a ride in my invisible plane?"

113
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,730
<3-21,Leonard>你为什么不直接跟她分手呢
<3-21,Leonard>Why don't you just break up with her?

114
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,370
<3-22,Stuart>不  我做不到
<3-22,Stuart>No, no, I can't.

115
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:01,940
<3-23,Leonard>为什么
<3-23,Leonard>Why not?

116
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,500
<3-24,Stuart>因为分手后  我形影单只  像你一样
<3-24,Stuart>'Cause then I'd be alone, like you.

117
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:08,650
<3-25,Raj>兄弟  你为什么不让沃罗威茨
<3-25,Raj>Dude, why don't you just invoke

118
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:10,410
<3-25,Raj>履行女友条例呢
<3-25,Raj>your girlfriend pact with Wolowitz?

119
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,250
<3-26,Leonard>因为我用不着他女朋友
<3-26,Leonard>Because I don't need his girlfriend

120
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,110
<3-26,Leonard>介绍一个女朋友给我
<3-26,Leonard>to set me up with one of her girlfriends.

121
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:18,260
<3-26,Leonard>我完全有能力自己找一个女朋友
<3-26,Leonard>I'm perfectly capable of finding a girl on my own.

122
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,760
<3-27,Raj>莱纳德  你让我想到
<3-27,Raj>Oh, Leonard, you remind me

123
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,450
<3-27,Raj>一个古老的搞笑故事
<3-27,Raj>of the funny old story about a man

124
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:24,710
<3-27,Raj>是讲一个男人拿着一叠
<3-27,Raj>who walks into a women's correctional institution

125
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:26,100
<3-27,Raj>女囚犯的释放许可
<3-27,Raj>with a stack of paperwork

126
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,690
<3-27,Raj>走进女子监狱
<3-27,Raj>that will allow the female convicts to go free.

127
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:30,360
<3-28,Leonard>你是想说  我即使拿着赦令
<3-28,Leonard>You're saying I couldn't get laid

128
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,260
<3-28,Leonard>走进女子监狱  也没人会跟我上床
<3-28,Leonard>in a women's prison with a handful of pardons.

129
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:36,400
<3-29,Raj>你到底还让不让我讲这个故事了
<3-29,Raj>Are you going to let me tell the story or not?

130
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,170
<3-29,Raj>莱纳德
<3-29,Raj>Leonard?

131
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:43,720
<4-1,Sheldon>你在睡觉吗
<4-1,Sheldon>Are you sleeping?

132
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,530
<4-2,Leonard>没有
<4-2,Leonard>No.

133
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:45,710
<4-3,Sheldon>你病了吗
<4-3,Sheldon>Are you ill?

134
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:46,920
<4-4,Leonard>没有
<4-4,Leonard>No.

135
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,820
<4-5,Sheldon>你还为你的寂寞和无人疼爱
<4-5,Sheldon>Are you still depressed

136
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,050
<4-5,Sheldon>而郁郁寡欢吗
<4-5,Sheldon>because you're alone, and no one loves you?

137
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,450
<4-6,Leonard>不知道  也许吧
<4-6,Leonard>I don't know. Maybe.

138
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:54,710
<4-7,Sheldon>我想让你知道  我由衷地关心
<4-7,Sheldon>I want you to know that I'm genuinely concerned

139
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:56,330
<4-7,Sheldon>你的身体健康
<4-7,Sheldon>about your well-being.

140
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,270
<4-8,Leonard>-谢谢  -不用客气
<4-8,Leonard>- Thank you.  - You're welcome.

141
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:01,450
<4-9,Sheldon>但是你还是没有理由把脚放在我的位子上
<4-9,Sheldon>But it's still no reason to have your feet in my spot.

142
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,520
<4-10,Amy (on webcam)>我可以说说我的看法吗
<4-10,Amy (on webcam)>May I offer an observation?

143
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:10,420
<4-11,Leonard>搞什么  她在这多久了
<4-11,Leonard>What the hell? How long has she been here?

144
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,400
<4-12,Sheldon>打我们从漫画店回来开始
<4-12,Sheldon>Since we got home from the comic bookstore.

145
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,170
<4-13,Leonard>那是两小时前的事了
<4-13,Leonard>That was two hours ago.

146
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:15,570
<4-14,Sheldon>根据你的建议
<4-14,Sheldon>As per your suggestion,

147
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:16,710
<4-14,Sheldon>我们正在相处
<4-14,Sheldon>we're hanging out.

148
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:17,810
<4-14,Sheldon>老实说  我都不知道
<4-14,Sheldon>Quite frankly, I don't see

149
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,500
<4-14,Sheldon>你有什么好大惊小怪的
<4-14,Sheldon>what all the hoopla's about.

150
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,810
<4-14,Sheldon>继续说  艾米
<4-14,Sheldon>Go on, Amy.

151
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:22,940
<4-15,Amy>从神经生物学的角度看  莱纳德
<4-15,Amy>From a neurobiological standpoint, Leonard,

152
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:23,680
<4-15,Amy>你之所以独身
<4-15,Amy>you may be alone

153
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,500
<4-15,Amy>可能是由于你的心理状态
<4-15,Amy>because your psychological state is causing

154
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,920
<4-15,Amy>导致你的身体散发出绝望的味道
<4-15,Amy>an actual pheromone-based stink of desperation.

155
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,580
<4-16,Sheldon>你知道这个理论吗  莱纳德
<4-16,Sheldon>Did you know that, Leonard?

156
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,760
<4-18,Sheldon>-不知道  -我就知道
<4-18,Sheldon>- No.  - I did.

157
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:36,320
<4-19,Amy>我知道有些人在公共聚集场所
<4-19,Amy>I understand that some people find mates

158
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,320
<4-19,Amy>像是酒吧或是小酒馆里寻找伴侣
<4-19,Amy>in social gathering places such as bars or taverns.

159
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,950
<4-19,Amy>你到酒吧或是酒馆试过吗
<4-19,Amy>Have you tried a bar or tavern?

160
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:43,200
<4-20,Leonard>没有  我才不要去酒吧里泡妞呢
<4-20,Leonard>No, I'm not gonna try to pick up a woman in a bar.

161
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,450
<4-21,Sheldon>明智的决定  听我分析  艾米
<4-21,Sheldon>Wise decision. You see, Amy,

162
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:49,110
<4-21,Sheldon>想要在酒吧成功找到伴侣  是要靠
<4-21,Sheldon>success at a bar is based on classic male attributes

163
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:52,240
<4-21,Sheldon>典型的男性特质的  像是身高  力量
<4-21,Sheldon>such as height, strength, attractiveness,

164
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,950
<4-21,Sheldon>魅力  还有喝酒和投飞镖的能力
<4-21,Sheldon>the ability to hold one's liquor and throw darts --

165
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,320
<4-21,Sheldon>或是边喝酒边投飞镖的能力
<4-21,Sheldon>separately or together.

166
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,630
<4-21,Sheldon>而莱纳德不具备其中的任何一点特质
<4-21,Sheldon>Leonard has none of these attributes,

167
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:00,210
<4-21,Sheldon>对吧  莱纳德
<4-21,Sheldon>right, Leonard?

168
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,350
<4-22,Leonard>没错
<4-22,Leonard>Right.

169
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,770
<4-23,Amy>并不是在所有吧都要这样的
<4-23,Amy>That's not true of all bars.

170
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:07,190
<4-23,Amy>比如说果汁吧
<4-23,Amy>Juice bars, for example.

171
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,300
<4-24,Sheldon>说得好  艾米
<4-24,Sheldon>Oh! Good point, Amy.

172
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,050
<4-24,Sheldon>在这个前提下
<4-24,Sheldon>Yeah, building on your premise,

173
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:13,470
<4-24,Sheldon>莱纳德可以经常光顾寿司吧
<4-24,Sheldon>Leonard could frequent sushi bars,

174
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:15,390
<4-24,Sheldon>沙拉吧  生蚝吧
<4-24,Sheldon>salad bars, oyster bars,

175
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:17,630
<4-24,Sheldon>还有苹果天才吧  你在干吗
<4-24,Sheldon>the Apple Genius Bar...what are you doing?

176
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,420
<4-25,Leonard (exiting the apartment)>继续说吧  我听着呢
<4-25,Leonard (exiting the apartment)>Keep going. I'm listening.

177
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,030
<4-26,Amy>真没礼貌
<4-26,Amy>That was rude.

178
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:24,510
<4-27,Sheldon>他总是这样
<4-27,Sheldon>He does it all the time.

179
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:27,560
<4-27,Sheldon>他就是社交无能的集合体
<4-27,Sheldon>He's a cornucopia of social awkwardness.

180
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,730
<4-28,Amy>集合体
<4-28,Amy>Cornucopia.

181
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:31,010
<4-28,Amy>多么甜美流畅的词呀
<4-28,Amy>What a mellifluous word.

182
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:32,910
<4-29,Sheldon>就把这个词定为今日美词吧
<4-29,Sheldon>Let's make that our word of the day.

183
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:35,910
<4-30,Amy>同意  明天开始用"甜美流畅"
<4-30,Amy>Agreed. And we'll use mellifluous tomorrow.

184
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,160
<4-31,Sheldon>我要去排空一下我的膀胱
<4-31,Sheldon>Well, I have to void my bladder.

185
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,310
<4-31,Sheldon>跟你一起相处很愉快
<4-31,Sheldon>It was nice spending this time with you.

186
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:42,380
<4-31,Sheldon>等一下
<4-31,Sheldon>Wait.

187
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:43,930
<4-32,Amy>我有个请求
<4-32,Amy>I have a request.

188
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:44,790
<4-33,Sheldon>什么请求

189
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:46,590

00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:47,680
<4-35,Sheldon>知道了
<4-35,Sheldon>I see.

191
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,290
<4-35,Sheldon>我回头答复你好吗
<4-35,Sheldon>Can I get back to you on that?

<4-42,Leonard>艾米只是你的女性朋友吗
<4-42,Leonard>that Amy is a girl who's your friend,

207
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,920
<4-42,Leonard>而不是你的女朋友

208
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,270
<4-44,Leonard>-嗯  -你以后就不能再这么说咯

210
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,600
<4-46,Leonard>她很显然

211
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,980
<4-46,Leonard>想要你们的关系更进一步
<4-46,Leonard>to take your relationship to the next level.

00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,490
<4-47,Sheldon>我不想更进一步
<4-47,Sheldon>I don't want the next level.

<4-48,Leonard>Well, how am I supposed to fix it?

217
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:43,070
<4-49,Sheldon>很简单  你想要女朋友

00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:44,610
<4-49,Sheldon>艾米想要当别人的女朋友

<4-50,Leonard>你都疯的
<4-50,Leonard>That is insane.

221
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:50,760
<4-51,Sheldon>没错  不会成功的
<4-51,Sheldon>You're right. It would never work.

222
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,580
<4-51,Sheldon>艾米觉得你很乏味
<4-51,Sheldon>Amy finds you tedious.

<4-52,Leonard>好吧  祝你好运
<4-52,Leonard>Okay, good luck.

<4-53,Sheldon>Wait! What am I supposed to do?

225
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:59,890
<4-54,Leonard>你有没有想过跟她分享你的感受
<4-54,Leonard>Well, have you considered telling her how you feel?

226
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:02,380
<4-55,Sheldon>莱纳德  我是物理学家  不是嬉皮士
<4-55,Sheldon>Leonard, I'm a physicist, not a hippie.

227
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:05,980
<4-56,Leonard>好吧  让我想想
<4-56,Leonard>All right, well, let me see

228
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:08,940
<4-56,Leonard>看我能不能用物理现象解释给你听
<4-56,Leonard>if I can explain your situation using physics.

229
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,040
<4-56,Leonard>如果说你被绑在
<4-56,Leonard>What would you be

230
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,060
<4-56,Leonard>一个围绕轴心成螺旋状的
<4-56,Leonard>if you were attached to another object

231
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:16,610
<4-56,Leonard>倾斜平面上的话  你的下场会是什么
<4-56,Leonard>by an inclined plane wrapped helically around an axis?

232
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:18,510
<4-57,Sheldon>拧一块儿了[也有完蛋的意思]
<4-57,Sheldon>Screwed.

233
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:22,750
<4-58,Leonard>懂了吧
<4-58,Leonard>There you go.

234
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:27,000
<4-58,Leonard>艾米说的没错
<4-58,Leonard>Amy's right.

235
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,930
<4-59,Sheldon>他真没劲儿
<4-59,Sheldon>He is tedious.

236
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:36,890
<5-1,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>霍华德  去开门
<5-1,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>Howard, get the door!

237
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:40,180
<5-2,Howard (off)>你干嘛不去
<5-2,Howard (off)>Why can't you get it?

238
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:45,100
<5-3,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>你知道我在为准备结肠镜检查浣肠
<5-3,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>You know I'm doing a bowel cleanse for my colonoscopy!

239
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:50,680
<5-3,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>我这里就像个大头朝下的火山
<5-3,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>I'm like an upside-down volcano here.

00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,870
<5-4,Howard>但愿你没听到

242
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:57,900
<5-5,Leonard>火山什么的吗  没听到
<5-5,Leonard>The volcano thing? No.

243
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,110
<5-6,Howard>怎么穿了这么一件T恤
<5-6,Howard>What's with the T-shirt?

244
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:01,600
<5-6,Howard>现在在苹果专卖店打工了吗
<5-6,Howard>You working at the Apple store now?

245
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,100
<5-7,Leonard>不是啦  就是随便穿的
<5-7,Leonard>No, it's just something I threw on.

246
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,550
<5-8,Howard>你的衣服我都认得
<5-8,Howard>I know all your shirts.

247
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:07,240
<5-8,Howard>你没这件
<5-8,Howard>That's not one of them...

248
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,800
<5-8,Howard>你假装在天才咨询吧工作
<5-8,Howard>You were pretending to work at the Genius Bar

249
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,000
<5-8,Howard>借机泡妞是不是
<5-8,Howard>to pick up women, weren't you?

250
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,580
<5-8,Howard>是
<5-8,Howard>Yeah.

251
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:16,480
<5-9,Leonard>我发现原来他们只管看着iPod
<5-9,Leonard>Turns out, they guard the iPods,

252
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,400
<5-9,Leonard>没人管这些T恤
<5-9,Leonard>but they don't guard the shirts.

253
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,530
<5-10,Howard>那成果如何
<5-10,Howard>So, how'd it go?

254
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:21,940
<5-11,Leonard>本来挺顺利的
<5-11,Leonard>It was going well.

255

<5-11,Leonard>我给个辣妹展示
<5-11,Leonard>I was showing this super hot girl

<5-11,Leonard>经理起了疑心  长话短说吧
<5-11,Leonard>The manager got suspicious, and, well, long story short,

258
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,580
<5-11,Leonard>那商场里真的有个小号房
<5-11,Leonard>they really do have a little jail in the mall.

259
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:35,630
<5-12,Howard>听哥句劝  千万别贴上假胡子接着回去装
<5-12,Howard>Just FYI, don't try to go back with a fake mustache.

260
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:37,220
<5-12,Howard>他们虽然不天才
<5-12,Howard>I mean, they may not really be geniuses,

261
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,410
<5-12,Howard>却能立马看出你是装的
<5-12,Howard>but they see right through that.

262
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:43,000
<5-13,Leonard>我申请调用女友约定  霍华德
<5-13,Leonard>I want to invoke the girlfriend pact, Howard.

263
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,160
<5-14,Howard>你这么饥渴
<5-14,Howard>You that desperate?

264
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,510
<5-15,Leonard>也不是  我就是想像你一样
<5-15,Leonard>No, I just... I want what you have.

265
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:48,440
<5-15,Leonard>你懂的  身边有个女人
<5-15,Leonard>You know, I want a woman in my life.

266
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,110
<5-16,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>天呐
<5-16,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>Holy Moses,

267
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:54,140
<5-16,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>菊花到底能灌进多少液体啊
<5-16,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>how much liquid can be in one tokus?

268
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,700
<5-17,Leonard>明确一下  我说的是伯纳黛特不是你妈
<5-17,Leonard>To be clear, I meant like Bernadette, not your mother.

269
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,320
<5-18,Howard>我明白你的意思
<5-18,Howard>Yeah, I know what you mean.

270
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,370
<6-1,Leonard>我要去见伯纳黛特的朋友了
<6-1,Leonard>Well, I'm off to meet Bernadette's friend.

271
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:08,640
<6-1,Leonard>我看起来咋样
<6-1,Leonard>How do I look?

272
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,940
<6-2,Sheldon>就好像《人体异形》里
<6-2,Sheldon>As if one of the plants

273
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:14,510
<6-2,Sheldon>某植物复制出来的你
<6-2,Sheldon>from Invasion of the Body Snatchers duplicated you in every way,

274
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:17,060
<6-2,Sheldon>不过是海量发胶版的
<6-2,Sheldon>only with an absurd amount of hair gel.

275
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:19,530
<6-3,Leonard>你在干嘛呢
<6-3,Leonard>What are you working on?

276
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:22,490
<6-4,Sheldon>我在清除我的网络足迹
<6-4,Sheldon>I'm removing my digital footprint from the Internet

277
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:24,620
<6-4,Sheldon>这样艾米·菲拉·福勒就找不到我了
<6-4,Sheldon>so Amy Farrah Fowler can't find me

278
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:27,220
<6-4,Sheldon>也就没法逼我见她妈了
<6-4,Sheldon>and compel me to meet her mother. Ah.

279
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:28,640
<6-5,Leonard>你是在玩儿失踪啊
<6-5,Leonard>You're going off the grid.

280
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,810

286
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,210
<6-9,Leonard>她直接过来怎么办
<6-9,Leonard>What if she just comes over?

287
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:44,350
<6-10,Sheldon>她找不到的

00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,440
<10-4,Amy>我请你去见我母亲这事
<10-4,Amy>I believe a misunderstanding may have occurred

385
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,420
<10-4,Amy>我想你可能有点误会
<10-4,Amy>when I asked you to meet my mother.

386
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,280
<10-5,Sheldon>我没误会
<10-5,Sheldon>No misunderstanding.

387
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:51,200
<10-5,Sheldon>我了解到那个要求意味着什么
<10-5,Sheldon>I've learned what that request actually means,

388
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,510
<10-5,Sheldon>我不想变成一个斜面绕轴
<10-5,Sheldon>and I don't want to be joined to another object

390
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:00,360
<10-6,Amy>谁说你完蛋了
<10-6,Amy>In what way are you screwed?

391
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:03,850
<10-6,Amy>我只是想把你当作男友介绍给我妈
<10-6,Amy>All I want to do is present you as my boyfriend to my mother

392
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:06,770
<10-6,Amy>让她相信我在恋爱  好让她放心
<10-6,Amy>so she'll be satisfied that I'm in a relationship.

393
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,200
<10-7,Sheldon>这么说我们是要做戏咯
<10-7,Sheldon>So we'd be perpetrating a ruse?

394
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,930
<10-8,Amy>一点没错
<10-8,Amy>Precisely.

395
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:14,250
<10-9,Sheldon>你没有无可救药地爱上我吗
<10-9,Sheldon>And you haven't fallen hopelessly in love with me?

396
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,090
<10-10,Amy>别傻了
<10-10,Amy>Don't be absurd.

397
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,820
<10-10,Amy>在我看来  爱情关系
<10-10,Amy>I find the notion of romantic love

398
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,620
<10-10,Amy>是种毫无必要的文化构造
<10-10,Amy>to be an unnecessary cultural construct

399
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:23,240
<10-10,Amy>对人类关系毫无价值可言
<10-10,Amy>that adds no value to human relationships.

400
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,450
<10-11,Sheldon>艾米·菲拉·福勒  这是我听过的
<10-11,Sheldon>Amy Farrah Fowler, that's the most pragmatic thing

401
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:28,720
<10-11,Sheldon>最务实的话了
<10-11,Sheldon>anyone has ever said to me.

402
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:31,440
<10-12,Amy>既然误会已经澄清了
<10-12,Amy>I trust this clarification allows us to return

403
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,760
<10-12,Amy>我们该回到男性朋友和女性朋友关系了吧
<10-12,Amy>to boy-slash-friend-slash-girl-slash-friend status.

404
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,190
<10-13,Sheldon>当然
<10-13,Sheldon>Of course.

405
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:38,630
<10-13,Sheldon>想和我一起去吃中餐么
<10-13,Sheldon>Would you like to join me for Chinese food?

406
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:40,950
<10-14,Amy>拜托  谢尔顿  别逼我
<10-14,Amy>Sheldon, please, you're suffocating me.

407
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:44,590
<10-15,Sheldon>不好意思
<10-15,Sheldon>My apologies.

408
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:47,150
<10-16,Amy>-晚安  艾米  -晚安  谢尔顿
<10-16,Amy>- Good night, Amy. - Good night, Sheldon.

409
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,590
<11-1,Howard>别这样  给她个机会
<11-1,Howard>Come on, just give her a chance.

410
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:52,050
<11-1,Howard>也许你会慢慢喜欢上她
<11-1,Howard>Maybe she'll grow on you.

411
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:56,150
<11-2,Leonard>也可能她最终成功扯下了我的蛋蛋
<11-2,Leonard>or maybe she'll finally succeed in ripping my nuts off.

412
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,430
<11-2,Leonard>毕竟还有93种办法她没尝试过呢
<11-2,Leonard>There are still 93 ways she hasn't tried yet.

413
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,020
<11-2,Leonard>听着  霍华德  谢谢你的好意
<11-2,Leonard>Look, H-Howard, I appreciate the effort,

414
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:05,610
<11-2,Leonard>但这是我经历过的最烂一次约会了
<11-2,Leonard>but this is, like, the worst date of my life.

415
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:06,990
<11-3,Howard>真的假的
<11-3,Howard>Seriously?

416
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:10,530
<11-3,Howard>我被个在犹太交友网上的准变性人给抢了
<11-3,Howard>I was once robbed by a pre-op transsexual I met on J-Date,

417
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:13,350
<11-3,Howard>这种约会甚至都排不进我的最烂前十
<11-3,Howard>and that didn't even crack my top ten.

418
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:17,370
<11-4,Leonard>我觉得区别在于  我懂得自重
<11-4,Leonard>I guess the difference is, I have some self-respect.

419
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:19,490
<11-5,Howard>我怎么不记得你有
<11-5,Howard>Not that I've ever seen.

420
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,800
<11-6,Leonard>最近才有的
<11-6,Leonard>It's relatively new.

421
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:23,080
<11-6,Leonard>我只是认识到
<11-6,Leonard>I just know that

422
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,400
<11-6,Leonard>我不想就为了能有个女友
<11-6,Leonard>I'm not gonna spend time with someone I don't like

423
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,380
<11-6,Leonard>而和不喜欢的女生在一起
<11-6,Leonard>simply to have a girlfriend.

424
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,880
<11-6,Leonard>我一个人也挺好
<11-6,Leonard>I'm okay on my own.

425
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,560
<11-7,Joy>好消息  我的胃腾够空间来吃甜食了
<11-7,Joy>Good news-- I made lots of room for dessert.

426
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:36,130
<11-8,Leonard>听着  乔伊  很高兴认识你  但...
<11-8,Leonard>Look, uh, Joy, it was nice to meet you, but...

<11-9,Joy>我也是  你下周末有空么
<11-9,Joy>Yeah, you, too. Hey, you got anything for next weekend?

<11-9,Joy>我表兄结婚  我要带个伴去
<11-9,Joy>I need a date for my cousin's wedding.

429
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,320
<11-10,Leonard>你在约我出去吗
<11-10,Leonard>You're asking me out?

430
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:42,940
<11-10,Leonard>是啊
<11-10,Leonard>Yeah.

431
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,100
<11-11,Joy>酒啊什么的免费畅饮哦
<11-11,Joy>And it's an open bar,

432
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,810
<11-11,Joy>说不定可以酒后那什么一下
<11-11,Joy>so I'll probably be giving it away.

433
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,500
<11-12,Leonard>我很期待
<11-12,Leonard>I look forward to it.

434
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,180
<12-1,Mrs Fowler (on webcam)>我也很高兴认识你  谢尔顿
<12-1,Mrs Fowler (on webcam)>It's nice to meet you, too, Sheldon.

435
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:03,460
<12-1,Mrs Fowler (on webcam)>艾米告诉我她有个男友时
<12-1,Mrs Fowler (on webcam)>I honestly didn't believe Amy

436
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:06,070
<12-1,Mrs Fowler (on webcam)>我真的难以置信
<12-1,Mrs Fowler (on webcam)>when she told me she had a boyfriend.

437
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:08,530
<12-2,Sheldon>我向你保证  我是有血有肉的真人
<12-2,Sheldon>I assure you I'm quite real.

438
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:12,120
<12-2,Sheldon>我和你女儿有着常规性交行为
<12-2,Sheldon>and I'm having regular intercourse with your daughter.

439
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:14,890
<12-3,Mrs Fowler>啥
<12-3,Mrs Fowler>What?

440
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:16,160
<12-3,Mrs Fowler>是的
<12-3,Mrs Fowler>Oh, yes.

441
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,050
<12-4,Sheldon>我们就如同发情期的野生动物
<12-4,Sheldon>We're like wild animals in heat.

442
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:22,330
<12-4,Sheldon>我们居然还完好无损  真是奇迹
<12-4,Sheldon>It's a wonder neither of us has been hurt.

443
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:26,660
<12-5,Mrs Fowler>艾米  他在说什么
<12-5,Mrs Fowler>Amy... what is he saying?

444
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,330
<12-6,Amy>你希望我交个男友  妈妈
<12-6,Amy>You wanted me to have a boyfriend, Mother.

445
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:30,410
<12-6,Amy>这就是我的男友
<12-6,Amy>Well, here he is.

446
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,870
<12-6,Amy>现在我得下线了
<12-6,Amy>Have to sign off now.

447
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:38,150
<12-6,Amy>我对谢尔顿的欲望已让我的花径颤抖
<12-6,Amy>My hunger for Sheldon is stirring in my loins.

448
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,840
<12-7,Sheldon>是的  我是时候该去
<12-7,Sheldon>Oh, yes, it's time for me to make love

449
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,630
<12-7,Sheldon>你女儿的阴道里做爱一番了
<12-7,Sheldon>to your daughter's vagina.

450
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:49,780
<12-9,Amy>多谢  谢尔顿  效果不错
<12-9,Amy>Thank you, Sheldon, that went very well.

451
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,640
<12-9,Amy>同感
<12-9,Amy>Agreed.

452
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,560
<12-10,Sheldon>艾米  我禁不住这样想
<12-10,Sheldon>Amy, I find myself wondering

453
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,890
<12-10,Sheldon>我们在交往过程中
<12-10,Sheldon>if we should actually engage in coitus

454
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:58,730
<12-10,Sheldon>至少该真的性交一次试试
<12-10,Sheldon>at least one time in our relationship.

455
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,210
<12-10,Sheldon>逗你玩
<12-10,Sheldon>Bazinga.

456
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:05,630
<12-10,Sheldon>该睡觉了  你也该走了
<12-10,Sheldon>Bedtime. Please show yourself out.
