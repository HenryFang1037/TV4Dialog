17
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:57,090
<1-1,Raj>然后我去了剑桥  超美妙的时光
<1-1,Raj>So then I went to Cambridge, which was wonderful

18
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:57,340
<1-1,Raj>不只是因为那是名校
<1-1,Raj>not only because it's a good school

19
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:01,580
<1-1,Raj>是因为那里看起来超像霍格沃茨的呢
<1-1,Raj>but because it totally looks like Hogwarts.

21
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,670
<1-1,Raj>我就是在那里爱上了天文学
<1-1,Raj>That's where I fell in love with astronomy,

22
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:07,180
<1-1,Raj>我现在是任职于加州理工的天体物理学家
<1-1,Raj>and now I'm an astrophysicist at Caltech,

23
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,200
<1-1,Raj>所以也可以这么说...
<1-1,Raj>so I guess you could say, uh,

24
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,700
<1-1,Raj>拉杰是我名  星辰是我命
<1-1,Raj>Raj is my name and stars are my game.

25
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,820
<1-1,Raj>我还有押韵命哦
<1-1,Raj>And rhyming is also my game.

26
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:19,420
<1-1,Raj>可以算是"一杰两命"
<1-1,Raj>So, uh, two games.

27
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,530
<1-1,Raj>好啦  我自己的事情说够了
<1-1,Raj>Uh, anyway, that-that's enough about me.

28
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:23,910
<1-1,Raj>我想听听关于你的一切
<1-1,Raj>I want to hear everything about you.

29
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,960
<1-2,Girl>我要去一趟厕所
<1-2,Girl>I have to go to the bathroom.

30
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:29,350
<1-2,Girl>我也会去厕所
<1-2,Girl>I go to the bathroom, too.

31
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,280
<1-3,Raj>虽然有时候频繁到我都不好意思说了
<1-3,Raj>Sometimes more frequently than I care to admit.

32
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,150
<1-3,Raj>不过我给医生检查过了  一切正常
<1-3,Raj>Oh, I've had it checked out, it's nothing.

33
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:40,450
<1-3,Raj>也太顺利了吧
<1-3,Raj>This is going great!

34
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,670
<1-3,Raj>能帮我的印度茶续杯吗
<1-3,Raj>Can I have a refill on my chai tea?

35
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,100
<1-3,Raj>太好了
<1-3,Raj>Yes...

36
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,290
<1-3,Raj>感觉就十分有戏啊
<1-3,Raj>I have a good feeling about this.

37
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,960
<1-3,Raj>早知道就买好套套了
<1-3,Raj>I should have bought condoms.

38
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,220
<1-3,Raj>生活大爆炸
<1-3,Raj>第六季  第十七集

39
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:25,650
<1-3,Raj>您好  我是谢尔顿·库珀博士
<1-3,Raj>Hello, I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

40
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,080
<2-1,Sheldon>欢迎收看由谢尔顿·库珀出品的《有趣的旗帜》
<2-1,Sheldon>Welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents: Fun with Flags.

41
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,830
<2-1,Sheldon>在此对本集节目的延误出品致歉
<2-1,Sheldon>My apologies that this episode is coming late.

42
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:39,530
<2-1,Sheldon>上周我曾拍摄了"黑人历史月"纪念集
<2-1,Sheldon>I did shoot one last week, in honor of Black History Month,

43
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:41,180
<2-1,Sheldon>但后来受到我室友的提点
<2-1,Sheldon>but I was informed by my roommate

44
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:44,160
<2-1,Sheldon>我在节目中对乔治·华盛顿·卡弗的精湛描述
<2-1,Sheldon>that my spot-on portrayal of George Washington Carver

45
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:46,990
<2-1,Sheldon>乔治·华盛顿·卡弗  黑人  美国教育家  植物学家
<2-1,Sheldon>农业化学家  对美国农业有巨大贡献

46
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,990
<2-1,Sheldon>会有人觉得带有"严重种族歧视"
<2-1,Sheldon>could be considered "wildly racist."

47
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:51,050
<2-1,Sheldon>我的心一直与所有的
<2-1,Sheldon>My heart goes out to the members

48
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:52,900
<2-1,Sheldon>非裔美国人群体同在
<2-1,Sheldon>of the African-American community,

49
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:56,190
<2-1,Sheldon>我们都是受所谓"高层"压迫的苦命人
<2-1,Sheldon>who, like me, have been kept down by The Man.

50
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:02,470
<2-1,Sheldon>《有趣的旗帜》不只是给旗帜狂热爱好者看的
<2-1,Sheldon>Now, Fun with Flags is not just for the flag aficionado;

51
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,890
<2-1,Sheldon>也十分适合新晋旗帜迷
<2-1,Sheldon>it's also for the flag novice,

52
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:06,360
<2-1,Sheldon>因此请了位特别嘉宾
<2-1,Sheldon>so, to help me with that,

53
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,760
<2-1,Sheldon>大家欢迎我的朋友  邻居  旗帜界处女
<2-1,Sheldon>please welcome my friend, neighbor, and flag virgin--

54
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,940
<2-1,Sheldon>不是现实生活的处女
<2-1,Sheldon>yeah, not a real virgin.

55
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,790
<2-4,Penny>她有过多次交媾经验了
<2-4,Penny>She's had coitus many times.

56
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:20,950
<2-1,Sheldon>有时就在本人听得见的范围里交媾呢
<2-1,Sheldon>Sometimes within earshot of this flag enthusiast.

57
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:24,330
<2-1,Sheldon>有次还是在本人在看《超人特工队》的时候
<2-1,Sheldon>Once while he was trying to watch The Incredibles.

58
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,050
<2-2,Penny>佩妮
<2-2,Penny>Penny.

59
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:30,190
<2-2,Penny>你好啊
<2-2,Penny>Hello.

60
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,760
<2-3,Sheldon>佩妮  我知道
<2-3,Sheldon>So, Penny, I understand

61
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,120
<2-3,Sheldon>你对旗帜有相当浓厚的兴趣  对吗
<2-3,Sheldon>you would like to learn more about flags.

62
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,560
<2-4,Penny>对啊  我有过太多次
<2-4,Penny>Yeah, I can't tell you how many times

63
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,670
<2-4,Penny>参加派对时  别人在大聊特聊旗帜
<2-4,Penny>I've been at a party where everyone's talking about flags

64
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:39,380
<2-4,Penny>而我却完全插不上话的经验了
<2-4,Penny>and I just couldn't join in. Yeah.

65
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:43,020
<2-5,Sheldon>那你来这里就对啦
<2-5,Sheldon>Well, you came to the right place.

66
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:48,240
<2-6,Penny>抱歉  我们能暂停一下下嘛
<2-6,Penny>Uh, I'm sorry, can we just pause for a minute?

67
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,720
<2-7,Sheldon>怎么了
<2-7,Sheldon>What's wrong?

68
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,540
<2-8,Penny>我只是觉得如果你对着我说话
<2-8,Penny>I just think it might look more natural

69
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,680
<2-8,Penny>会比你对着摄影机说话更自然
<2-8,Penny>if you talked to me instead of the camera,

70
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,460
<2-8,Penny>这样看起来更像在轻松聊天
<2-8,Penny>you know, like, like a real conversation.

71
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,810
<2-8,Penny>我们在表演课上有教过这个
<2-8,Penny>It's something we work on in my acting class.

72
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:01,250
<2-9,Sheldon>有意思
<2-9,Sheldon>Interesting.

73
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,720
<2-9,Sheldon>有些人在评语栏就有留言过
<2-9,Sheldon>A few people in the comments section have said

74
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,020
<2-9,Sheldon>说我的教学像机器人
<2-9,Sheldon>that my delivery is robotic.

75
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:10,520
<2-9,Sheldon>我一直以为是在称赞我
<2-9,Sheldon>Perhaps that isn't the compliment it sounds like.

76
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,150
<2-10,Penny>我们再试一遍吧  这一次
<2-10,Penny>Yeah, let's try it again, and maybe, this time,

77
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:15,250
<2-10,Penny>也多注意一下你的肢体语言
<2-10,Penny>you could work on your body language a bit.

78
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,060
<2-10,Penny>当你这样弯腰驼背
<2-10,Penny>You know, when you're all hunched like that,

79
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,400
<2-10,Penny>会像是拒观众于千里之外
<2-10,Penny>you're shutting the audience out,

80
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,740
<2-10,Penny>如果你放松  肢体张开
<2-10,Penny>but when you're relaxed and open,

81
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,550
<2-10,Penny>会像是欢迎大家进入
<2-10,Penny>you're inviting them in.

82
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:24,510
<2-10,Penny>有道理
<2-10,Penny>Right.

83
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,280
<2-11,Sheldon>那我该用哪一种呢
<2-11,Sheldon>And which one do I want?

84
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,020
<2-12,Penny>欢迎大家那种啊
<2-12,Penny>Let's try open.

85
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,740
<2-13,Sheldon>我们的好友  旗帜  教过我的一件事就是
<2-13,Sheldon>If our friend, the flag, has taught me anything,

86
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,000
<2-13,Sheldon>向着风指引你的方向飘
<2-13,Sheldon>it's to go where the wind takes you.

87
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,520
<2-13,Sheldon>不过要先确保自身良好地固定在旗杆上
<2-13,Sheldon>As long as you remain firmly attached to a rigid pole.

88
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:40,330
<2-13,Sheldon>开始
<2-13,Sheldon>And... action.

89
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:52,000
<2-13,Sheldon>佩妮
<2-13,Sheldon>So, Penny...

90
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,970
<2-13,Sheldon>哪些对旗帜的疑问会让你夜不成寐呢
<2-13,Sheldon>what sort of flag questions keep you awake at night?

91
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:03,210
<2-14,Penny>我是内布拉斯加州人
<2-14,Penny>Um, well, I'm from Nebraska.

92
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:05,650
<2-14,Penny>不如你给我讲讲我们的州旗
<2-14,Penny>So what can you tell me about the state flag?

93
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:07,450
<2-15,Sheldon>天啊  佩妮
<2-15,Sheldon>Gosh, Penny...

94
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:10,260
<2-15,Sheldon>你今早早餐吃了啥啊
<2-15,Sheldon>what'd you have for breakfast?

95
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:13,190
<2-15,Sheldon>喝了一杯"超棒问题果汁"吗
<2-15,Sheldon>A big glass of good question juice?

96
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:17,580
<2-15,Sheldon>内布拉斯加州的州旗面就只是州徽
<2-15,Sheldon>The Nebraska state flag is simply the state seal

97
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,670
<2-15,Sheldon>印在蓝底上
<2-15,Sheldon>on a field of blue.

98
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,290
<2-15,Sheldon>打开腿  欢迎大家进来
<2-15,Sheldon>Spread your legs; invite them in.

99
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:41,400
<3-1,Howard>相信我  绝对不对劲
<3-1,Howard>I'm telling you, something's wrong.

100
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,010
<3-1,Howard>拉杰碰到麻烦的时候  我都会有感应
<3-1,Howard>I can always feel it when Raj is in trouble.

101
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,470
<3-2,Bernadette>天啊  我们结婚前  你们俩是有多亲密啊
<3-2,Bernadette>Geez, how close were you guys before we got married?

102
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:48,710
<3-3,Leonard>不要知道比较好
<3-3,Leonard>Don't look under that rock.

103
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,260
<3-4,Howard>-拉杰  你没事吧  -你在家吗
<3-4,Howard>- Raj, you okay? - You in there?

104
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,470
<3-5,Raj (off)>走开啦
<3-5,Raj (off)>Go away!

105
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,730
<3-6,Leonard>兄弟  开门嘛
<3-6,Leonard>Come on, buddy, open up.

106
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,330
<3-7,Howard>我们都很担心你
<3-7,Howard>We're worried about you.

107
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:59,380
<3-8,Raj (off)>就因为我没去上班
<3-8,Raj (off)>Oh, just because I stopped going to work

108
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:02,580
<3-8,Raj (off)>然后又不接电话  你们就觉得我出事了吗
<3-8,Raj (off)>and answering my phone you think something bad happened?

109
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,830
<3-8,Raj (off)>也可能是发生了好事啊
<3-8,Raj (off)>Maybe something good happened.

110
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,810
<3-9,Bernadette>那有好事发生了吗
<3-9,Bernadette>Did something good happen?

111
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:08,430
<3-10,Raj (off)>当然没有
<3-10,Raj (off)>Of course not!

112
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,540
<3-10,Raj (off)>好事从不发生在我身上
<3-10,Raj (off)>Nothing good ever happens!

113
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:18,740
<3-12,Raj>怎么
<3-12,Raj>What?

114
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,910
<3-13,Leonard>没事  就是感叹下
<3-13,Leonard>Nope, just-just... whoa.

115
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,170
<3-14,Bernadette>里面一股恶臭味
<3-14,Bernadette>It smells pretty ripe in here.

116
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:33,580
<3-14,Bernadette>光是用眼睛都可以感觉到
<3-14,Bernadette>You kind feel it in your eyes.

117
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:36,220
<3-15,Leonard>拉杰  发生什么事了
<3-15,Leonard>Raj, what's going on?

118
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:39,490
<3-16,Raj>我又被一个女人羞辱了
<3-16,Raj>I was humiliated by yet another woman.

119
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:41,210
<3-17,Howard>你没有杀死她  然后碎尸吧
<3-17,Howard>You didn't kill her and chop her up--

120
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,910
<3-17,Howard>屋里的味道不是尸臭  对吧
<3-17,Howard>that's not what we're smelling, right?

121
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:44,770
<3-17,Howard>不是
<3-17,Howard>No.

122
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,580
<3-18,Raj>我带她去喝咖啡
<3-18,Raj>I took her for coffee,

123
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,620
<3-18,Raj>结果她为了摆脱我
<3-18,Raj>and she snuck out the bathroom window

124
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,930
<3-18,Raj>从厕所的窗户溜走了
<3-18,Raj>to get away from me.

125
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:51,810
<3-19,Bernadette>可怜的小宝贝
<3-19,Bernadette>Oh, you poor baby.

126
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:53,100
<3-20,Raj>我去看了
<3-20,Raj>I went and looked.

127
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,530
<3-20,Raj>那个窗户又高又小
<3-20,Raj>It was a high and tiny window.

128
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,340
<3-20,Raj>她一定是想逃到了极点
<3-20,Raj>She must have been very motivated.

129
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:02,730
<3-21,Howard>我很遗憾  那太伤人了  但拜托
<3-21,Howard>I'm sorry. That's awful, but come on.

130
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:04,660
<3-21,Howard>你得放下这件事
<3-21,Howard>you got to shake it off.

131
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,740
<3-22,Leonard>对啊  你不能窝在公寓里
<3-22,Leonard>Yeah, you can't stay in your apartment

132
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,270
<3-22,Leonard>就此度过余生吧
<3-22,Leonard>for the rest of your life.

133
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,550
<3-22,Leonard>为什么不能
<3-22,Leonard>Why not?

134
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,700
<3-23,Raj>有网上购物和隔天送达
<3-23,Raj>With online shopping and overnight delivery,

135
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,460
<3-23,Raj>我要什么有什么
<3-23,Raj>I can get anything I want.

136

148
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:36,980

<11-4,Amy>but you throw their own feces back at them

320
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:17,860
<11-4,Amy>就突然之间"不专业"了
<11-4,Amy>and suddenly you're "unprofessional."

<11-5,Leonard>真是抱歉

<12-1,Raj>谁会说"等下"啊
<12-1,Raj>Oh, who says "just a sec"?

<12-4,Girl>不用了  我马上就走
<12-4,Girl>Oh, no, I can't stay.

346
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:49,030
<12-6,Girl>我只是想说
<12-6,Girl>I just wanted to say...

347
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:51,380
<12-6,Girl>抱歉我从咖啡店逃走了
<12-6,Girl>I'm sorry for running out of the coffee shop.

348
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,720
<12-6,Girl>那样做太不像话了
<12-6,Girl>That wasn't cool.

349
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,060
<12-6,Girl>所以
<12-6,Girl>So, uh...

350
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,630
<12-6,Girl>是的
<12-6,Girl>Yeah.

00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:59,730
<12-7,Raj>等等
<12-7,Raj>Wait.

353
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:04,490
<12-7,Raj>至少能告诉我  哪里出错了吗
<12-7,Raj>Can you at least tell me what went wrong?

354
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,460
<12-7,Raj>没事的  什么原因我都能接受
<12-7,Raj>It's okay. I can take anything.

355
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,610
<12-7,Raj>除非是说我做的事
<12-7,Raj>Unless it's something I did,

356
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:08,620
<12-7,Raj>说的话  或是我这人怎样
<12-7,Raj>or said, or am.

357
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,390
<12-7,Raj>这些原因会让我发火的
<12-7,Raj>'Cause those are, like, my buttons.

358
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:15,060
<12-8,Girl>不是这些原因
<12-8,Girl>No, it's not any of that.

359
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,220
<12-8,Girl>只是
<12-8,Girl>It's just...

360
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:18,560
<12-8,Girl>我在陌生人周围
<12-8,Girl>I kind of have a hard time

361
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,780
<12-8,Girl>会感觉非常不自在
<12-8,Girl>around people I don't know.

362
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,030
<12-11,Raj>真的吗
<12-11,Raj>Really?

363
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:22,930
<12-12,Girl>那你那晚
<12-12,Girl>Then what were you doing

364
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:24,950
<12-9,Raj>为什么会去漫画店
<12-9,Raj>at the comic book store that night?

365
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,720
<12-10,Girl>我在尝试强迫自己
<12-10,Girl>I've been trying to force myself into situations

366
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,810
<12-10,Girl>面对我不喜欢的环境
<12-10,Girl>that I'm not comfortable with.

367
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:31,930
<12-10,Girl>我在商店橱窗上看到宣传单
<12-10,Girl>I saw the flyer in the store window,

368
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:34,060
<12-10,Girl>我强迫自己去的
<12-10,Girl>and I made myself go in.

369
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,970
<12-10,Girl>我压根连个漫画粉都不是
<12-10,Girl>I don't even like comic books.

370
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:37,270
<12-11,Raj>我也不喜欢
<12-11,Raj>Yeah, me neither.

371
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:38,380
<12-12,Girl>那你为什么要去
<12-12,Girl>Then what were you doing there?

372
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,160
<12-13,Raj>我说谎了  我爱漫画书
<12-13,Raj>I lied. I love them.

373
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:44,740
<12-13,Raj>我这样说只是希望你愿意和我约会
<12-13,Raj>I only said that so you'd go out with me.

374
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,770
<12-14,Girl>你还是不要和我约会为妙
<12-14,Girl>Oh, you don't want to do that.

375
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:48,600
<12-14,Girl>我不能算是个正常人
<12-14,Girl>I'm kind of broken.

376
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,750
<12-15,Raj>太好了
<12-15,Raj>That's great.

377
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:50,880
<12-15,Raj>我也不正常
<12-15,Raj>I'm broken, too.

378
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,830
<12-16,Girl>你不是的
<12-16,Girl>Oh, no, you're not.

379
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:52,890
<12-17,Raj>我相当不正常
<12-17,Raj>Oh, I totally am.

380

<13-3,Penny>我觉得你是个非常有奉献精神的人
<13-3,Penny>I think you have a great capacity for devotion.

400
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:56,700
<13-3,Penny>她去世后你会孤单对吗
<13-3,Penny>You'll be lonely when she passes on, won't you?

401
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,850
<13-3,Penny>我明白这种感觉
<13-3,Penny>I understand what that is.

402
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:01,800
<13-4,Actor>孤单的感觉吗

405
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:08,560
<13-6,Sheldon>什么时候才能演到有轨电车啊
<13-6,Sheldon>But when do they get to the part about streetcars?

406
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:14,640
<13-7,Penny (as Blanche)>在我很小的时候
<13-7,Penny (as Blanche)>...when I was a very young girl.

407
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,750
<13-7,Penny (as Blanche)>我16岁时  发现了

<13-7,Penny (as Blanche)>一下子
<13-7,Penny (as Blanche)>All at once,

410
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,460
<13-7,Penny (as Blanche)>一切来得太突然了
<13-7,Penny (as Blanche)>and much, much too completely.

411
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:28,110
<13-7,Penny (as Blanche)>就好像你突然将明亮的灯光
<13-7,Penny (as Blanche)>It was like you suddenly turned a blinding light

412
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:31,660
<13-7,Penny (as Blanche)>照到总是一半处于黑暗中的东西一样
<13-7,Penny (as Blanche)>on something that had always been half a shadow.

413
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:35,290
<13-7,Penny (as Blanche)>于是我的生活发生了天翻地覆的变化
<13-7,Penny (as Blanche)>That's how it struck the world for me.

414
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,340
<13-7,Penny (as Blanche)>但我是不幸的
<13-7,Penny (as Blanche)>But I was unlucky.

415
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:40,610
<13-7,Penny (as Blanche)>被欺骗了
<13-7,Penny (as Blanche)>Deluded.

00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:44,930
<13-10,Amy>咱们的佩妮是大明星
<13-10,Amy>Our Penny's a star.

419
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:48,360
<13-11,Sheldon>她怎么能记住那么多台词
<13-11,Sheldon>How can she remember all those lines,

420
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,000
<13-11,Sheldon>但作为服务员  却不记得
<13-11,Sheldon>but as a waitress, she can't remember

421
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,930
<13-11,Sheldon>我的汉堡是不要加番茄的
<13-11,Sheldon>"no tomato" on my hamburger?
