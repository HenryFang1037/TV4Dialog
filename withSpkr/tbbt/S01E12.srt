1
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,310
<1-1,Sheldon>关于瞬间转移有一个问题
<1-1,Sheldon>Here's the problem with teleportation.

2
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:14,510
<1-2,Leonard>折磨我吧
<1-2,Leonard>Lay it on me.

3
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,630
<1-3,Sheldon>假设我们可以发明一个设备
<1-3,Sheldon>Assuming a device could be invented

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,480
<1-3,Sheldon>它能在某一地点
<1-3,Sheldon>Which would identify the quantum state of matter

5
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:20,220
<1-3,Sheldon>确定某一个体的量子结构
<1-3,Sheldon>Of an individual in one location

6
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:23,760
<1-3,Sheldon>并把其图像传送到另一地点再重新拼接到一起
<1-3,Sheldon>And transmit that pattern to a distant location for reassembly,

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,820
<1-3,Sheldon>你便用不着传送这个个体
<1-3,Sheldon>You would not have actually transported the individual.

8
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:28,050
<1-3,Sheldon>你就能在某一地点摧毁他
<1-3,Sheldon>You would have destroyed him in one location

9
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:30,470
<1-3,Sheldon>然后在另一地点重造他
<1-3,Sheldon>And recreated him in another.

10
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:33,860
<1-4,Leonard>真神奇啊
<1-4,Leonard>How about that.

11
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,720
<1-5,Sheldon>就我个人来说  我永远都不会用传送器
<1-5,Sheldon>Personally, I would never use a transporter,

12
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:38,810
<1-5,Sheldon>因为原本的谢尔顿
<1-5,Sheldon>Because the original sheldon would have to be

13
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,880
<1-5,Sheldon>一定要被分解才能创造一个新的谢尔顿
<1-5,Sheldon>Disintegrated in order to create a new sheldon.

14
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:44,400
<1-6,Leonard>新的谢尔顿在任一方面
<1-6,Leonard>Would the new sheldon be in any way

15
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:46,880
<1-6,Leonard>会比旧的谢尔顿好吗
<1-6,Leonard>An improvement on the old sheldon?

16
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,280
<1-7,Sheldon>不会  还是一模一样的
<1-7,Sheldon>No, he would be exactly the same.

17
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:52,110
<1-8,Leonard>这就是个问题
<1-8,Leonard>That is a problem.

18
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:54,320
<1-9,Sheldon>你也看出问题来了吧
<1-9,Sheldon>So you see it too.

19
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:55,600
<1-10,Dr Gablehouser (arriving)>霍夫斯塔德博士
<1-10,Dr Gablehouser (arriving)>Dr. hofstadter.

20
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:56,790
<1-10,Dr Gablehouser (arriving)>库珀博士
<1-10,Dr Gablehouser (arriving)>Dr. cooper.

21
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,360
<1-10,Dr Gablehouser (arriving)>盖博豪瑟博士
<1-10,Dr Gablehouser (arriving)>Dr. gablehauser. dr. gablehauser.

22
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:00,820
<1-12,Gablehouser>先生们  允许我向你们介绍丹尼斯·金
<1-12,Gablehouser>Gentlemen, I'd like you to meet dennis kim.

23
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:04,110
<1-12,Gablehouser>丹尼斯可是非常吃香的准博士
<1-12,Gablehouser>Dennis is a highly sought-after doctoral candidate,

24
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:06,000
<1-12,Gablehouser>我们希望他能在这里完成他的研究生论文
<1-12,Gablehouser>And we're hopingto have him do his graduate work here.

25
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:07,530
<1-13,Leonard>研究生论文  非常不错啊
<1-13,Leonard>Graduate work. very impressive.

26
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:09,580
<1-14,Gablehouser>而他只有15岁而已
<1-14,Gablehouser>And he's only 15 years old.

27
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:13,440
<1-15,Sheldon>不错嘛  我14岁就开始我的研究生学业
<1-15,Sheldon>Not bad-- i, myself, started graduate school at 14.

28
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,340
<1-16,Dennis>我浪费了一年  因为我和家人
<1-16,Dennis>Well, I lost a year while my family

29
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:17,690
<1-16,Dennis>从地道逃出朝鲜花了一年时间
<1-16,Dennis>Was tunneling out of north korea.

30
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:22,530
<1-17,Leonard>金发球占先(网球术语)
<1-17,Leonard>Advantage Kim.

31
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:23,880
<1-18,Gablehouser>我想你们能
<1-18,Gablehouser>I thought maybe you boys

32
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:25,140
<1-18,Gablehouser>带丹尼斯到处转转
<1-18,Gablehouser>Could show dennis around.

33
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:26,170
<1-18,Gablehouser>让他看看为什么这里会是
<1-18,Gablehouser>Let him see why we're

34
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,610
<1-18,Gablehouser>全国最好的物理研究所
<1-18,Gablehouser>The best physics research facility in the country.

35
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:29,880
<1-19,Dennis>我已经知道你们不是了
<1-19,Dennis>I already know you're not.

36
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,730
<1-19,Dennis>你们没有OSG联盟的计算机
<1-19,Dennis>You don't have an open science grid computer

37
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,470
<1-19,Dennis>或是自由电子激光器  并且这里的
<1-19,Dennis>Or a free electron laser, and the string theory research

38
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,200
<1-19,Dennis>弦理论研究也已经是强弩之末
<1-19,Dennis>Being done here is nothing but a dead end.

39
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:37,940
<1-20,Sheldon>不好意思  那正是我的研究项目
<1-20,Sheldon>Excuse me, that is my research,

40
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,860
<1-20,Sheldon>从任何角度来说都还不是强弩之末
<1-20,Sheldon>And it is by no means a dead end.

41
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,730
<1-21,Dennis>很明显你现在还没发现
<1-21,Dennis>Well, obviously you don't see it yet,

42
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,710
<1-21,Dennis>不过相信我  有一天你会的
<1-21,Dennis>But trust me, you will.

43
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:47,470
<1-22,Gablehouser>丹尼斯  我们已经讨论过这些了
<1-22,Gablehouser>Dennis, we've discussed this.

44
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,040
<1-22,Gablehouser>我们正在更新我们的设备
<1-22,Gablehouser>We're in the process of updating our equipment,

45
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:52,220
<1-22,Gablehouser>我们欢迎你加入我们一起研究
<1-22,Gablehouser>And we welcome your input on our research goals,

46
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:54,150
<1-22,Gablehouser>并且我们已经同意说即使你想
<1-22,Gablehouser>And we've agreed to look the other way if you want

47
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,170
<1-22,Gablehouser>花20%你吸引来的助学金
<1-22,Gablehouser>To use up to 20% of the grant money you attract

48
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,840
<1-22,Gablehouser>把你的爷爷从平壤偷渡过来
<1-22,Gablehouser>To smuggle your grandfather out of pyongyang.

49
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,410
<1-22,Gablehouser>我们要留下他  孩子们
<1-22,Gablehouser>We want him here, boys.

50
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:03,580
<1-22,Gablehouser>看你们了
<1-22,Gablehouser>Make it happen.

51
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,330
<1-23,Leonard>是的  先生
<1-23,Leonard>Yes, sir.

52
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,450
<1-24,Sheldon>你尽管放心
<1-24,Sheldon>You can count on us.

53
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,260
<1-24,Sheldon>看我们的
<1-24,Sheldon>We're on it.

54
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,560
<1-24,Sheldon>你说"强弩之末"到底是什么意思?
<1-24,Sheldon>What the hell do you mean, "dead end"?

55
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,270
<1-25,Dennis>我的意思是  虚真空上的全部地表
<1-25,Dennis>I mean, the whole landscape of false vacuums

56
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,840
<1-25,Dennis>在弦理论里相当于
<1-25,Dennis>In string theory could be as large as ten

57
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:14,360
<1-25,Dennis>其10到500次幂的大小
<1-25,Dennis>To the five hundredth power.

58
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:17,760
<1-25,Dennis>再说  看  巧克力奶
<1-25,Dennis>In addition-- ooh, look, chocolate milk.

59
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:22,410
<1-26,Sheldon>我有了不祥的预感
<1-26,Sheldon>I sense a disturbance in the force.

60
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:25,050
<1-27,Leonard (in a Yoda voice)>我感到很不妙啊
<1-27,Leonard (in a Yoda voice)>A bad feeling I have about this.

65
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,900
<2-1,Leonard>丹尼斯  你来美国多长时间了?
<2-1,Leonard>So, dennis, how long have you been in america?

66
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:54,970
<2-2,Dennis>一年半了
<2-2,Dennis>A year and a half.

67
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:55,700
<2-3,Leonard>真的啊
<2-3,Leonard>No kidding.

68
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:56,820
<2-3,Leonard>你英文说得很好啊
<2-3,Leonard>You speak english really well.

69
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:58,450
<2-4,Dennis>你也是
<2-4,Dennis>So do you.

70
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,680
<2-4,Dennis>就是你好像老喜欢
<2-4,Dennis>Except for your tendency to end

71
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:03,160
<2-4,Dennis>把介词放在句尾
<2-4,Dennis>Sentences with prepositions.

72
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,720
<2-5,Leonard>你说什么在?
<2-5,Leonard>What are you talking about?

73
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:08,890
<2-6,Dennis>例如这句
<2-6,Dennis>That.

74
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,410
<2-7,Sheldon>他没说错
<2-7,Sheldon>He's not wrong.

75
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:12,990
<2-7,Sheldon>好吧
<2-7,Sheldon>All right...

76
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,280
<2-7,Sheldon>这就是我的办公室
<2-7,Sheldon>And this is my office.

77
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:15,240
<2-8,Dennis>这是参观的一部分吗
<2-8,Dennis>Is this part of the tour?

78
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,110
<2-9,Sheldon>不是  再见
<2-9,Sheldon>Nope. good-bye.

79
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:20,010
<2-10,Leonard>别这样  谢尔顿  我们还没带他看过什么地方呢
<2-10,Leonard>Come on, sheldon, we've hardly shown him anything.

80
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,520
<2-10,Leonard>好吧
<2-10,Leonard>All right.

81
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:22,950
<2-11,Sheldon>这是我的书桌
<2-11,Sheldon>This is my desk.

82
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,030
<2-11,Sheldon>这些是我的书  这是我的门
<2-11,Sheldon>These are my books; this is my door.

83
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,550
<2-11,Sheldon>出去请随手关门  再见
<2-11,Sheldon>Please close it behind you. good-bye.

84
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,110
<2-12,Dennis>看来你在做关于
<2-12,Dennis>Looks like you're doing work

85
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,440
<2-12,Dennis>量子循环的修正
<2-12,Dennis>In quantum loop corrections.

86
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:32,470
<2-13,Sheldon>观察力很敏锐
<2-13,Sheldon>Keen observation.

87
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,250
<2-13,Sheldon>再见
<2-13,Sheldon>Good-bye.

88
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,700
<2-14,Dennis>你知道你是哪儿错了  是吧
<2-14,Dennis>You see where you went wrong, don't you?

89
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,460
<2-15,Sheldon>里奥纳德
<2-15,Sheldon>Leonard?

90
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,070
<2-16,Leonard>什么
<2-16,Leonard>Yeah?

91
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,040
<2-17,Sheldon>带他出去
<2-17,Sheldon>Get him out.

92
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:42,840
<2-17,Sheldon>走吧  丹尼斯
<2-17,Sheldon>Come on, dennis.

93
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:44,040
<2-18,Leonard>我带你去娱乐室
<2-18,Leonard>I'll show you the recreation center.

94
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,390
<2-18,Leonard>那里有些健身器材
<2-18,Leonard>They've got nautilus equipment.

95
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,840
<2-19,Dennis>你看我像练举重的人吗
<2-19,Dennis>Do I look like I lift weights?

96
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,370
<2-20,Leonard>举不了很重吧
<2-20,Leonard>Not heavy ones.

97
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,530
<2-21,Dennis>令我吃惊的是你竟然没考虑
<2-21,Dennis>It's startling to me you haven't considered

98
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:55,590
<2-21,Dennis>洛伦兹不变量和场论步骤
<2-21,Dennis>A lorentz invariant or field theory approach.

99
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,340
<2-22,Sheldon>你认为我没考虑吗
<2-22,Sheldon>You think I haven't considered it?

100
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:59,520
<2-22,Sheldon>你真的认为我没考虑过吗
<2-22,Sheldon>You really think I haven't considered it?

101
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,380
<2-23,Dennis>你考虑到了吗
<2-23,Dennis>Have you considered it?

102
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,350
<2-24,Sheldon>带他出去  里奥纳德
<2-24,Sheldon>Get him out, leonard.

103
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,760
<2-25,Leonard>走吧  丹尼斯
<2-25,Leonard>Come on, dennis.

104
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,970
<2-25,Leonard>我带你参观辐射研究室
<2-25,Leonard>I'll show you the radiation lab.

105
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,200
<2-26,Dennis>哇  你赢了史蒂文森奖?
<2-26,Dennis>Wow, you won the stevenson award?

106
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:11,130
<2-26,Dennis>是的
<2-26,Dennis>Yes.

107
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:14,560
<2-27,Sheldon>事实上  我是历史上年纪最小的获奖人
<2-27,Sheldon>In fact, I am the youngest person ever to win it.

108
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:16,710
<2-28,Dennis>真的吗  几岁?
<2-28,Dennis>Really? how old?

109
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,670
<2-29,Sheldon>14岁半
<2-29,Sheldon>Fourteen and a half.

110
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,580
<2-30,Dennis>那你"曾是"历史上年纪最小的获奖人
<2-30,Dennis>Hm, you were the youngest person ever to win it.

111
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:25,600
<2-31,Leonard>是不是感觉像看着一面
<2-31,Leonard>It's like looking into an obnoxious

112
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:28,320
<2-31,Leonard>另人讨厌的镜子?
<2-31,Leonard>Little mirror, isn't it?

113
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,480
<3-1,Penny (to Raj)>这个真的很好吃吧
<3-1,Penny (to Raj)>This is really delicious, isn't it?

114
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,870
<3-1,Penny (to Raj)>仍旧只有醉了的时候才能跟我说话  是吧
<3-1,Penny (to Raj)>Still can't talk to me unless you're drunk, huh?

115
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:46,150
<3-1,Penny (to Raj)>亲爱的  你被伤害得太深了
<3-1,Penny (to Raj)>Oh, sweetie, you are so damaged.

116
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:49,600
<3-2,Howard>我也被伤害了
<3-2,Howard>Hey, I'm damaged, too.

117
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,190
<3-2,Howard>给霍华德一个拥抱怎样?
<3-2,Howard>How about a hug for howie?

118
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,390
<3-3,Penny>当然可以  拉杰  抱抱霍华德
<3-3,Penny>Sure. raj, hug howard.

119
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,130
<3-5,Leonard>有什么事要和大家分享吗
<3-5,Leonard>Something you'd like to share?

120
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:05,320
<3-5,Leonard>可能是  一个悲情故事?
<3-5,Leonard>A tale of woe, perhaps?

121
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,080
<3-5,Leonard>15岁
<3-5,Leonard>Fifteen years old.

122
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:11,090
<3-6,Sheldon>丹尼斯·金才15岁就已经能纠正我的研究成果了
<3-6,Sheldon>Dennis Kim's 15 years old, and he's already correcting my work.

123
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,910
<3-6,Sheldon>今天  我从沃尔夫冈·阿玛多伊斯·莫扎特变成了...
<3-6,Sheldon>Today, I went from being wolfgang amadeus mozart, to...

124
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,310
<3-6,Sheldon>你知道  另一个人
<3-6,Sheldon>You know, that other guy.

125
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,320
<3-7,Howard>安东尼奥·萨利埃雷?(想除掉莫扎特的人)
<3-7,Howard>Antonio salieri?

126
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:22,040
<3-8,Sheldon>天呐  现在就连你也比我聪明了
<3-8,Sheldon>Oh god, now even you're smarter than me.

127
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,450
<3-9,Howard>谢尔顿  你要知道
<3-9,Howard>You know, sheldon, you don't have

128
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,980
<3-9,Howard>你并没有那么多朋友
<3-9,Howard>So many friends that you can afford

129
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,120
<3-9,Howard>可以留给你来侮辱
<3-9,Howard>To start insulting them.

130
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,810
<3-10,Leonard>吃饭吧  谢尔顿  你会感觉好点的
<3-10,Leonard>Just eat, sheldon, you'll feel better.

131
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,330
<3-11,Sheldon>还浪费食物干吗
<3-11,Sheldon>Why waste food?

132
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,860
<3-11,Sheldon>在德州  如果一只奶牛没奶了
<3-11,Sheldon>In texas, when a cow goes dry,

133
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,960
<3-11,Sheldon>他们就不继续喂它了  他们会把它带出去
<3-11,Sheldon>They don't keep feeding it, they just take her out

134
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:37,120
<3-11,Sheldon>对准脑门来一枪
<3-11,Sheldon>And shoot her between the eyes.

135
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,680
<3-12,Penny>我糊涂了
<3-12,Penny>I'm confused.

136
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:41,050
<3-12,Penny>谢尔顿没奶了?
<3-12,Penny>Did sheldon stop giving milk?

137
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:44,090
<3-13,Leonard>你不能被这么个小孩给惹毛啊
<3-13,Leonard>You can't let this kid get to you.

138
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,280
<3-13,Leonard>你一直都知道有一天会出现个人
<3-13,Leonard>You always knew that someday someone would come along

139
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:47,610
<3-13,Leonard>既比你年轻又比你聪明
<3-13,Leonard>Who was younger and smarter.

140
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,520
<3-14,Sheldon>没错  但我设想的是在我死了
<3-14,Sheldon>Yes, but I assumed I would've been dead

141
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:51,180
<3-14,Sheldon>几百年后  并且他的名字旁边
<3-14,Sheldon>Hundreds of years and that there'd be

142
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:54,470
<3-14,Sheldon>会有个星号  因为他是个半机械人
<3-14,Sheldon>An asterisk by his name because he'd be a cyborg.

143
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,960
<3-15,Penny>这么说你现在有了个小小的竞争对手
<3-15,Penny>So you've got a little competition.

144
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:58,800
<3-15,Penny>我真不明白这有什么严重的
<3-15,Penny>I really don't see what the big deal is.

145
00:05:58,810 --> 00:05:59,950
<3-16,Sheldon>你当然不明白
<3-16,Sheldon>Well, of course you don't.

146
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,550
<3-16,Sheldon>你从来没有成为顶尖过
<3-16,Sheldon>You've never excelled at anything.

147
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,610
<3-17,Penny>我不明白  最开始
<3-17,Penny>I don't understand-- exactly how

148
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,940
<3-17,Penny>他怎么会交到任何朋友的?
<3-17,Penny>Did he get any friends in the first place?

149
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,840
<3-18,Howard>因为我们喜欢里奥纳德
<3-18,Howard>We liked leonard.

150
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:14,810
<3-19,Leonard>你现在想怎么样  谢尔顿  放弃吗
<3-19,Leonard>Well, what are you gonna do, sheldon, just give up?

151
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,160
<3-19,Leonard>是的
<3-19,Leonard>Yes.

152
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:17,580
<3-20,Sheldon>当他花了一辈子所完成的成果
<3-20,Sheldon>It's what a rational person does

153
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:19,660
<3-20,Sheldon>被一个刚过青春期的亚洲神童否决时
<3-20,Sheldon>When his entire life's work is invalidated

154
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:22,440
<3-20,Sheldon>任何理性的人都会这么做
<3-20,Sheldon>By a postpubescent asian wunderkind.

155
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:25,090
<3-20,Sheldon>他停止他徒劳的努力
<3-20,Sheldon>He ceases his fruitless efforts,

156
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,930
<3-20,Sheldon>他捐献他的身体给科学研究
<3-20,Sheldon>He donates his body to scientific research,

157
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,900
<3-20,Sheldon>现在他等待死亡
<3-20,Sheldon>And he waits to die.

158
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,480
<3-21,Penny>我现在又糊涂了
<3-21,Penny>You know, I'm confused again.

159
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:34,010
<3-21,Penny>是他要等死呢  还是我们可以
<3-21,Penny>Is he waiting, or do we get

160
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,240
<3-21,Penny>对准他脑门来一枪?
<3-21,Penny>To shoot him between the eyes?

161
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,400
<4-2,Leonard>我决定了  你说的对
<4-2,Leonard>I've decided you're right.

162
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:44,200
<4-3,Sheldon>我的事业还没有完结
<4-3,Sheldon>My career is not over.

163
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:45,080
<4-4,Leonard>好极了!
<4-4,Leonard>Great!

164
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:46,630
<4-5,Sheldon>但既然丹尼斯·金
<4-5,Sheldon>But since the arrival of dennis kim

165
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,260
<4-5,Sheldon>已经诠释了我的研究是徒劳的
<4-5,Sheldon>Has rendered my research pointless,

166
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:50,840
<4-5,Sheldon>那我需要找些别的东西来研究
<4-5,Sheldon>I just have to find something else to focus on.

167
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:51,790
<4-6,Leonard>好极了!
<4-6,Leonard>Great!

168
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,240
<4-7,Sheldon>所以我决定我要跟你合作
<4-7,Sheldon>So I've decided I'm going to collaborate with you.

169
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,580
<4-8,Leonard>"好极了"
<4-8,Leonard>Great.

170
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:02,310
<4-9,Sheldon>你现在具体在做什么?
<4-9,Sheldon>So what exactly is it you do?

171
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,470
<4-9,Sheldon>我知道你常常说起
<4-9,Sheldon>I know you chatter on about it all the time,

172
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,700
<4-9,Sheldon>但我从没怎么注意听
<4-9,Sheldon>But I've never really paid attention.

173
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,500
<4-10,Leonard>好  现在我在设计一个实验
<4-10,Leonard>Okay, well, right now I'm designing an experiment

174
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:11,510
<4-10,Leonard>来研究海平面上宇宙辐射的软性分立
<4-10,Leonard>To study the soft component of cosmic radiation

175
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,460
<4-10,Leonard>但是我真的不需要任何帮助
<4-10,Leonard>At sea level, but I really don't need any help.

176
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:15,330
<4-11,Sheldon>你肯定需要
<4-11,Sheldon>Oh, sure you do.

177
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:17,710
<4-11,Sheldon>看原理图  这个东西是什么?
<4-11,Sheldon>Now, see, what's this here in the schematic?

178
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,990
<4-11,Sheldon>那个是激光阵列吗
<4-11,Sheldon>Is that a laser array?

179
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,220
<4-12,Leonard>是的
<4-12,Leonard>Yes. now, hm...

180
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,740
<4-13,Sheldon>如果你用氩激光器而不是氦氖
<4-13,Sheldon>What happens if you use argon lasers

181
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,420
<4-13,Sheldon>会怎么样?
<4-13,Sheldon>Instead of helium-neon?

182
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,900
<4-14,Leonard>那样就会爆炸
<4-14,Leonard>It would blow up.

183
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:31,170
<4-15,Sheldon>你肯定吗  比较肯定
<4-15,Sheldon>Are you sure? pretty sure.

184
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,830
<4-17,Sheldon>"比较肯定"可不是很科学
<4-17,Sheldon>"pretty sure" is not very scientific.

185
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,280
<4-17,Sheldon>你平常都这样吗?
<4-17,Sheldon>Is this how you normally work?

186
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:36,980
<4-17,Sheldon>只是预感和猜测结果?
<4-17,Sheldon>Just hunches and guesses and stuff?

187
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:40,350
<4-18,Leonard>好了  谢尔顿  我理解你现在
<4-18,Leonard>Okay, sheldon, I understand that you're

188
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,020
<4-18,Leonard>正经历着事业上的小小危机
<4-18,Leonard>Going through a bit of a career crisis,

189
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,730
<4-18,Leonard>你在寻找一些其他的领域
<4-18,Leonard>You're searching for some other area

190
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,960
<4-18,Leonard>让你可以感觉自己有价值并有建设性
<4-18,Leonard>Where you can feel valuable and productive,

191
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:47,160
<4-18,Leonard>但是我需要告诉你一些事
<4-18,Leonard>But I need to tell you something,

192
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:48,620
<4-18,Leonard>你希望你仔细听清楚
<4-18,Leonard>And I want you to listen carefully.

193
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:49,520
<4-19,Sheldon>好吧
<4-19,Sheldon>All right.

194
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:51,670
<4-20,Leonard>走开
<4-20,Leonard>Go away.

195
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,870
<4-21,Sheldon>如果你担心会和我共享这荣誉的话
<4-21,Sheldon>If you're concerned about sharing credit with me,

196
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,240
<4-21,Sheldon>你的名字可以放在前面...我走
<4-21,Sheldon>Your name can go first-- I'm going.

197
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:05,540
<5-1,Howard (into phone)>是个小的  褐色的袋子  妈!
<5-1,Howard (into phone)>It's a small, brown paper bag, ma!

198
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:07,630
<5-1,Howard (into phone)>我现在正瞅着呢
<5-1,Howard (into phone)>I'm looking in it right now.

199
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:09,920
<5-1,Howard (into phone)>我骗你干嘛?
<5-1,Howard (into phone)>Why would I make that up?

200
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:12,770
<5-1,Howard (into phone)>里面根本就没有巧克力点心
<5-1,Howard (into phone)>There's no ding dong in it.

201
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,090
<5-1,Howard (into phone)>明天给我两份点心有什么用  我今天又吃不到
<5-1,Howard (into phone)>How are two ding dongs tomorrow gonna help me today?

202
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:22,090
<5-1,Howard (into phone)>那么...
<5-1,Howard (into phone)>So...

203
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,060
<5-2,Sheldon (entering)>这就是工程是吧
<5-2,Sheldon (entering)>This is engineering, huh?

204
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,870
<5-3,Howard (into phone)>我一会再跟您说
<5-3,Howard (into phone)>I'll talk to you later.

205
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,370
<5-2,Sheldon (entering)>工程
<5-2,Sheldon (entering)>Engineering.

206
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,440
<5-4,Sheldon>由这些杰出的半职业的工人
<5-4,Sheldon>Where the noble semiskilled laborers

207
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:32,350
<5-4,Sheldon>来完成那些思考和梦想者的设想
<5-4,Sheldon>Execute the vision of those who think and dream.

208
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,670
<5-4,Sheldon>好啊  科学小矮人
<5-4,Sheldon>Hello, oompah loompahs of science.

209
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,170
<5-5,Howard>谢尔顿  你来这里做什么
<5-5,Howard>Sheldon, what are you doing here?

210
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,980
<5-6,Sheldon>我就过来打声招呼
<5-6,Sheldon>I just came by to say hello.

211
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,610
<5-7,Howard>我在这个研究室工作了3年
<5-7,Howard>I've been in this lab for three years.

212
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,070
<5-6,Sheldon>你从来没到这里来打过招呼
<5-6,Sheldon>You've never come by to say hello.

213
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,150
<5-8,Sheldon>因为在此之前  我有更重要的事要做
<5-8,Sheldon>Well, up until now, I've had better things to do.

214
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:50,860
<5-8,Sheldon>我们今天要做什么?
<5-8,Sheldon>So, what are we making today?

215
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:53,210
<5-9,Howard>一个小的支撑有效载荷结构
<5-9,Howard>A small payload support structure

216
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,230
<5-9,Howard>提供给欧洲的科学实验方案
<5-9,Howard>For a european science experimental package

217
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,900
<5-9,Howard>这个会装在下一艘太空船里
<5-9,Howard>That's going up on the next space shuttle.

218
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:58,900
<5-10,Sheldon>真的?  这东西怎么工作?
<5-10,Sheldon>Really? how does it work?

219
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,470
<5-11,Howard>当完成之后  这个将会放在
<5-11,Howard>When this is done, it will be attached

220
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,570
<5-11,Howard>有效载重舱上  还有传感器
<5-11,Howard>To the payload bay, and the sensor apparatus

221
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,480
<5-11,Howard>也会被装上
<5-11,Howard>Will rest on it.

222
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,980
<5-12,Sheldon>就是个架子
<5-12,Sheldon>So it's a shelf.

223
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,830
<5-13,Howard>不是  你不明白  在加速过程中
<5-13,Howard>No, you don't understand-- during acceleration,

224
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,150
<5-13,Howard>它需要保持完全的水平并且提供...
<5-13,Howard>It needs to stay perfectly level and provide...

225
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,370
<5-13,Howard>好吧  它就是个架子
<5-13,Howard>Yeah, okay, it's a shelf.

226
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:21,090
<5-14,Sheldon>我注意到了你用的是钛
<5-14,Sheldon>Now, I notice you're using titanium.

227
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,870
<5-14,Sheldon>你有否考虑过用碳纳米管?
<5-14,Sheldon>Did you give any consideration to carbon nanotubes?

228
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,630
<5-14,Sheldon>它们更轻  更便宜  并且具有两倍的抗张强度
<5-14,Sheldon>They're lighter, cheaper, and have twice the tensile strength.

229
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,850
<5-14,Sheldon>谢尔顿
<5-14,Sheldon>Sheldon,

230
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,570
<5-15,Howard>我办公室里有这么张证书
<5-15,Howard>There's a diploma in my office

231
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:32,440
<5-15,Howard>上面写着我获得了工程硕士学位
<5-15,Howard>That says I have a master's in engineering.

232
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:33,720
<5-16,Sheldon>并且这里还有张你妈妈给你写的字条
<5-16,Sheldon>And you also have a note from your mother

233
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:36,070
<5-16,Sheldon>上面写着  "我爱你  小水泡"
<5-16,Sheldon>That says, "i love you, bubula."

234
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:39,910
<5-16,Sheldon>但是哪个都不是能证明
<5-16,Sheldon>But neither of those is a cogent argument

235
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,160
<5-16,Sheldon>钛比纳米管好的有力论点
<5-16,Sheldon>For titanium over nanotubes.

236
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:43,950
<5-17,Howard>-谢尔顿  -干吗
<5-17,Howard>Sheldon? yes?

237
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,240
<5-19,Howard>走开!
<5-19,Howard>Go away!

238
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:49,050
<5-20,Sheldon>里奥纳德叫你这么说的吗
<5-20,Sheldon>Did leonard tell you to say that?

239
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:51,510
<5-21,Howard>不是  我自己想出来的
<5-21,Howard>No, I thought of it all by myself.

240
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:56,070
<5-22,Sheldon>不能这么巧吧
<5-22,Sheldon>That can't be a coincidence.

241
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,230
<5-22,Sheldon>这里肯定有些因果的联系我没想到
<5-22,Sheldon>There must be some causal link I'm missing.

242
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:04,390
<6-1,Raj>走开!
<6-1,Raj>Go away!

243
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,840
<6-2,Sheldon>真是奇怪  真是奇怪
<6-2,Sheldon>Curiouser and curiouser.

244
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,170
<7-1,Howard (entering)>他在这吗
<7-1,Howard (entering)>Is he here?

245
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:22,310
<7-2,Leonard>如果他在  我就不会在了
<7-2,Leonard>If he were, I wouldn't be.

246
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,240
<7-3,Raj>你知道他干了什么吗
<7-3,Raj>Do you know what he did?

247
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,610
<7-3,Raj>他看着我做了10分钟
<7-3,Raj>He watched me work for ten minutes,

248
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,090
<7-3,Raj>然后开始设计一个可以
<7-3,Raj>And then started to design a simple piece

249
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,430
<7-3,Raj>取代我的简易软件
<7-3,Raj>Of software that could replace me.

250
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:32,530
<7-4,Leonard>这有可能吗
<7-4,Leonard>Is that even possible?

251
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,580
<7-5,Raj>他确实做到了
<7-5,Raj>As it turns out, yes.

252
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:38,100
<7-6,Howard>里奥纳德  我们需要干点什么了
<7-6,Howard>Something's got to be done about him, leonard.

253
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:39,120
<7-6,Howard>什么呢?
<7-6,Howard>Like what?

254
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:40,610
<7-7,Leonard>他永远都不可能接受
<7-7,Leonard>He'll never be able to cope with the fact

255
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,350
<7-7,Leonard>一个15岁的小孩比他更聪明
<7-7,Leonard>That some 15-year-old kid is smarter

256
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,810
<7-7,Leonard>比他更有成就
<7-7,Leonard>And more accomplished than he is.

257
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,450
<7-8,Raj>如果这个小孩发生了什么意外
<7-8,Raj>Well, what if something were to happen to this boy

258
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,980
<7-8,Raj>然后再也不会对谢尔顿造成威胁呢
<7-8,Raj>So he was no longer a threat to sheldon?

259
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,700
<7-9,Howard>那我们的问题就解决了
<7-9,Howard>Then our problem would be solved.

260
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,040
<7-10,Leonard>等等  你们是在讨论谋杀丹尼斯·金吗
<7-10,Leonard>Hang on, are we talking about murdering dennis kim?

261
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,570
<7-10,Leonard>我不是说不行
<7-10,Leonard>I'm not saying no.

262
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:01,670
<7-11,Howard>我们不必做这么绝
<7-11,Howard>We don't have to go that far.

263
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,260
<7-11,Howard>还是有其他办法的
<7-11,Howard>There are other means available.

264
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:05,740
<7-12,Raj>我们不能遣送他回朝鲜
<7-12,Raj>We can't send him back to north korea.

265
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:07,860
<7-12,Raj>他知道怎么逃出来
<7-12,Raj>He knows how to get out.

266
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,850
<7-13,Howard>我们唯一要做的是
<7-13,Howard>The only thing we need to do

267
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,800
<7-13,Howard>让这个小孩的关注点发生偏移
<7-13,Howard>Is make this kim kid lose his focus.

268
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:13,830
<7-14,Leonard>不可能
<7-14,Leonard>Won't happen.

269
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,090
<7-14,Leonard>他除了物理以外什么都没有兴趣
<7-14,Leonard>He is not interested in anything but physics.

270
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,350
<7-15,Howard>生物怎么样?
<7-15,Howard>What about biology?

271

<7-17,Howard>什么?  你知道  性(双关语)
<7-17,Howard>What? you know, biology.

272
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,190
<7-17,Howard>只有这件事可以完全让顶级头脑
<7-17,Howard>The one thing that can completely derail

<7-18,Leonard>霍华德  他才15岁
<7-18,Leonard>Howard, he's 15.

275
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:26,650
<7-19,Howard>是的  怎么了
<7-19,Howard>Yeah, so?

<7-19,Howard>And my grade point average fell from a 5.0 to a 1.8.

278
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,470

00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:55,770
<10-18,Leonard>比如?
<10-18,Leonard>Like what?

357
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:58,540
<10-18,Leonard>我们可不能把15岁的女孩弄醉
<10-18,Leonard>We can't get 15-year-old girls drunk.

358
00:14:58,710 --> 00:14:59,290
<10-19,Howard>我们能啊
<10-19,Howard>Or can we?

359
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,270
<10-20,Leonard>不  我们不能
<10-20,Leonard>No, we can't.

360
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,010
<10-21,Howard>我想你不是说"我们不能"
<10-21,Howard>I don't think you mean "we can't."

361
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,900
<10-21,Howard>而是说"我们不应该"
<10-21,Howard>I think you mean "we shouldn't."

362
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:07,740
<10-22,Sheldon>霍华德  你是个犹太人
<10-22,Sheldon>Hey, howard, you're a jew.

363
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:09,450
<10-22,Sheldon>如果有另外一面哭墙
<10-22,Sheldon>If there was another wailing wall

364
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,040
<10-22,Sheldon>和在耶路撒冷的一模一样
<10-22,Sheldon>Exactly like the one in jerusalem

365
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:13,790
<10-22,Sheldon>不过比较靠近炸玉米卷摊和卖便宜处方药的药店
<10-22,Sheldon>But close to taco stands and cheap prescription drugs,

366
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,230
<10-22,Sheldon>你还会对着那面墙哀哭吗
<10-22,Sheldon>Would you still be able to wail at it?

367
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:20,610
<10-22,Sheldon>好吧  又是我没事找事
<10-22,Sheldon>Okay, it's definitely me.

368
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,000
<10-23,Leonard>我们不能等着老天来决定了
<10-23,Leonard>Okay, we cannot leave this to chance.

369
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:25,470
<10-23,Leonard>咱们来挑个女孩
<10-23,Leonard>Let's pick a girl and figure out

370
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,980
<10-23,Leonard>然后琢磨下怎么让她和丹尼斯搞到一起
<10-23,Leonard>How to get her together with dennis.

371
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:30,230
<10-24,Raj>对  那个怎么样?
<10-24,Raj>Okay, how about that one?

372
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,820
<10-24,Raj>我对这一类的太了解了
<10-24,Raj>Uh-uh. I know the type.

373
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:34,240
<10-25,Howard>拉拉队长  学生会干事  总是跟运动员约会
<10-25,Howard>Cheerleader, student council, goes out with the jocks,

374
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,320
<10-25,Howard>甚至看都不会看那些天才班里的人
<10-25,Howard>Won't even look at anybody in the gifted program.

375
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:37,750
<10-25,Howard>之后如果  你苦苦哀求她两年
<10-25,Howard>And if, after two years of begging,

376
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,880
<10-25,Howard>她终于愿意跟你约会
<10-25,Howard>She does agree to go out with you,

377
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:39,780
<10-25,Howard>结果却也是一个事先设计好的骗局
<10-25,Howard>It turns out to be a setup and you're in the backseat

378
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,340
<10-25,Howard>你光着屁股坐在你妈汽车的后座上时
<10-25,Howard>Of your mom's car with your pants off

379
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:44,170
<10-25,Howard>会有整个橄榄球队队员过来嘲笑你的...
<10-25,Howard>While the whole football team laughs at y...

380
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:47,950
<10-26,Raj>你在哭吗
<10-26,Raj>Are you crying?

381
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,500
<10-27,Howard>没有  有点过敏罢了
<10-27,Howard>No, I have allergies.

382
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:54,660
<10-28,Raj>好吧  那这个怎么样?
<10-28,Raj>Okay, um, oh, hey, how about her?

383
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,670
<10-29,Leonard>可以  如果他想帮她写个几年作业
<10-29,Leonard>Sure, if he wants to spend a couple years

384
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,450
<10-29,Leonard>而那些时候她通常已经用白俄罗斯人(一种鸡尾酒)
<10-29,Leonard>Doing her homework while she drinks herself

385
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,910
<10-29,Leonard>把自己灌得不省人事了
<10-29,Leonard>Into a stupor with nonfat white russians.

386
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,010
<10-29,Leonard>而你还得扶着她的头从厕所出来
<10-29,Leonard>And you're the one holding her head

387
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,470
<10-29,Leonard>她会一边吐一边告诉你说
<10-29,Leonard>Out of the toilet while she's puking

388
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,800
<10-29,Leonard>真希望"男的都像你这样"
<10-29,Leonard>And telling you she wishes "more guys were like you."

389
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:08,880
<10-29,Leonard>然后她会拿着你帮她写的论文顺利地进入康奈尔大学
<10-29,Leonard>And then she gets into cornell because you wrote her essay

390
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:10,710
<10-29,Leonard>当你某个周末开车去找她的时候
<10-29,Leonard>For her and you drive up to visit her one weekend

391
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,190
<10-29,Leonard>她却会装出一副好像从来都不认识你的样子
<10-29,Leonard>And she acts like she doesn't even know you.

392
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,250
<10-30,Raj>算了  这个也不行
<10-30,Raj>Okay, so not her, either.

393
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,160
<10-30,Raj>那个怎么样?
<10-30,Raj>Oh, hey, how about her?

394
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:22,700
<10-31,Howard>有点意思  长得不错
<10-31,Howard>Oh, interesting, kind of pretty,

395
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:25,230
<10-31,Howard>有点胖乎乎  因此很可能不那么孤傲
<10-31,Howard>A little chubby, so probably low self-esteem.

396
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,420
<10-32,Leonard>我看就是她了
<10-32,Leonard>I think that's our girl.

397
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:28,220
<10-32,Leonard>咱们谁过去跟她搭话
<10-32,Leonard>One of us should go talk to her.

398
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,970
<10-33,Raj>我不可能跟她搭话  你去吧
<10-33,Raj>I can't talk to her-- you do it.

399
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,260
<10-34,Leonard>我怎么可能就这么过去跟她搭话
<10-34,Leonard>I can't just go up and talk to her.

400
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:34,090
<10-34,Leonard>霍华德  你去吧
<10-34,Leonard>Howard, you talk to her.

401
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,870
<10-35,Howard>不好说  一旦让她瞄到我的话
<10-35,Howard>I don't know, she'll never go for the kid

402
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,990
<10-35,Howard>她肯定不会去找那小孩了
<10-35,Howard>Once she gets a peek at this.

403
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,770
<10-36,Raj>知道吗  如果在印度  这就简单多了
<10-36,Raj>You know, if we were in india, this would be simpler.

404
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,990
<10-36,Raj>跟她父亲谈五分钟  20头山羊  一台笔记本电脑
<10-36,Raj>Five minutes with her dad, 20 goats and a laptop,

405
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,840
<10-36,Raj>一切搞定
<10-36,Raj>And we'd be done.

406
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:47,250
<10-37,Leonard>可我们不在印度啊
<10-37,Leonard>Well, we're not in india.

407
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,110
<10-38,Raj>好啊  那我们看看你要怎么办
<10-38,Raj>All right, why don't we do it your way then?

408
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:49,920
<10-38,Raj>我们安排这个女孩搬到
<10-38,Raj>We'll arrange for this girl

409
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:51,510
<10-38,Raj>与丹尼斯只有一走廊之隔的地方
<10-38,Raj>To move in across the hall from dennis

410
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,780
<10-38,Raj>让他可以像哈巴狗一样几个月不停地为她倾倒
<10-38,Raj>So he can pathetically moon over her for months on end.

411
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:57,450
<10-39,Leonard>好  那确实没有道理
<10-39,Leonard>Okay, that was uncalled for.

412
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,310
<10-40,Raj>是你先开始的  哥们
<10-40,Raj>You started it, dude.

413
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:03,210
<10-41,Gablehouser>请大家听我说好吗
<10-41,Gablehouser>Could I have everyone's attention, please?

414
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:06,630
<10-41,Gablehouser>这是一个多么美妙的场合
<10-41,Gablehouser>What a wonderful occasion this is,

415
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,420
<10-41,Gablehouser>我们十分幸运能有机会
<10-41,Gablehouser>And how fortunate that it should happen to fall

416
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:10,720
<10-41,Gablehouser>来参加"带你女儿来工作"日
<10-41,Gablehouser>On take your daughter to work day.

421
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:23,350

<10-43,Gablehouser>Was not only the valedictorian at stanford university,

422
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,860
<10-43,Gablehouser>他更是极具声望的史蒂文森奖
<10-43,Gablehouser>He is also the youngest recipient

423
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:28,310
<10-43,Gablehouser>有史以来最年轻的获得者
<10-43,Gablehouser>Of the prestigious stevenson award.

424
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,890
<10-44,Sheldon>直到纪录被半机械人打破前最年轻的
<10-44,Sheldon>Youngest till the cyborgs rise up!

425
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:33,750
<10-45,Gablehouser>现在  废话不多说
<10-45,Gablehouser>And now, without any further ado,

00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,370
<10-48,Dennis>算了吧  谢了
<10-48,Dennis>No, thanks.

434
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:52,240
<10-48,Dennis>我得跟爱玛去趟购物中心
<10-48,Dennis>I'm going to the mall with emma.

00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,580
<10-50,Leonard>那孩子搞到了一个
<10-50,Leonard>The kid got a girl.

436
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,390
<10-51,Raj>难以置信
<10-51,Raj>Unbelievable.

437
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:05,640
<10-52,Howard>你们谁看到他是怎么做的了吗
<10-52,Howard>Did anyone see how he did it?

438

<10-53,Sheldon (to Gablehouser)>别担心  看我的
<10-53,Sheldon (to Gablehouser)>Don't worry, I've got this.

441
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,950
<10-53,Sheldon (to Gablehouser)>因为他的年幼和无知
<10-53,Sheldon (to Gablehouser)>By virtue of his youth and naivete,

442
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,100
<10-53,Sheldon (to Gablehouser)>被人类交往中一种神秘的需求所俘虏时
<10-53,Sheldon (to Gablehouser)>Has fallen prey to the inexplicable need

443
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:20,240
<10-53,Sheldon (to Gablehouser)>请允许我插两句
<10-53,Sheldon (to Gablehouser)>For human contact, let me step in

445
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:26,170
<10-53,Sheldon (to Gablehouser)>而那些人际关系的种种将会继续困惑
<10-53,Sheldon (to Gablehouser)>And that social relationships will continue to baffle

446
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:28,290
<10-53,Sheldon (to Gablehouser)>并且排斥我
<10-53,Sheldon (to Gablehouser)>And repulse me.

<10-53,Sheldon (to Gablehouser)>谢谢
<10-53,Sheldon (to Gablehouser)>Thank you.

448
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:33,950
<10-54,Howard>他回来了
<10-54,Howard>He's back.

449
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,390
<10-55,Leonard>是啊  任务完成了
<10-55,Leonard>Yeah, mission accomplished.

450
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,200
<10-56,Raj>别提这任务了
<10-56,Raj>Forget the mission.

451
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:39,350
<10-56,Raj>那小屁孩自己是怎么吊上马子的?
<10-56,Raj>How did that little yutz get a girl on his own?

452
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:41,790
<10-57,Howard>我想现在已经不是我们年轻时的那个时代了
<10-57,Howard>I guess times have changed since we were young.

453
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,390
<10-57,Howard>天才也性感了
<10-57,Howard>Smart is the new sexy.

454
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,380
<10-58,Leonard>那为什么我们每天晚上还是孤身一人回家?
<10-58,Leonard>Then why do we go home alone every night?

455
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:48,050
<10-58,Leonard>我们也还是天才啊
<10-58,Leonard>We're still smart.

456
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,830
<10-59,Raj>也许我们太天才了
<10-59,Raj>Maybe we're too smart.

457
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,080
<10-59,Raj>天才到了物极必反的地步
<10-59,Raj>So smart it's off-putting.

458
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:55,070
<10-60,Howard>是  说得没错
<10-60,Howard>Yeah, let's go with that.

459
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,170
<10-60,Howard>简直不敢相信
<10-60,Howard>Unbelievable.

460
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,340
<11-1,Howard>我制造的元件
<11-1,Howard>Components I built

461
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:03,610
<11-1,Howard>已经用在了国际空间站上  而我只得到了一张
<11-1,Howard>Are on the international space station and I get a ticket

462
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,840
<11-1,Howard>公园里发射模型火箭的门票
<11-1,Howard>For launching a model rocket in the park.

463
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:06,840
<11-2,Leonard>我不知道这张票对于
<11-2,Leonard>I don't know if the ticket was

464
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:08,210
<11-2,Leonard>来这里发射是不是那么重要
<11-2,Leonard>So much for the launch as it was

465
