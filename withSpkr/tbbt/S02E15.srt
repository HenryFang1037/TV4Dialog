8
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,500
<1-1,Penny>伙计们  拜托
<1-1,Penny>Fellas, please.

9
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,760
<1-2,Howard>佩妮  别这样
<1-2,Howard>Penny, come on.

10
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:33,500
<1-2,Howard>我们刚润好嗓子
<1-2,Howard>We were just finding our sound.

11
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,130
<1-3,Penny>确实
<1-3,Penny>You found it.

12
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:38,560
<1-3,Penny>听起来就像被割草机碾过的猫叫
<1-3,Penny>It's the sound of a cat being run over by a lawn mower.

13
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,330
<1-4,Leonard (entering on the phone)>我真的很忙
<1-4,Leonard (entering on the phone)>I'm really very busy.

14
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,700
<1-4,Leonard (entering on the phone)>有没有办法延期
<1-4,Leonard (entering on the phone)>Is there any way that we can put this off

15
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,760
<1-4,Leonard (entering on the phone)>好让我有时间准备
<1-4,Leonard (entering on the phone)>until I have more time to prepare?

16
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:46,400
<1-4,Leonard (entering on the phone)>当然
<1-4,Leonard (entering on the phone)>Of course.

17
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:49,000
<1-4,Leonard (entering on the phone)>但你知道我害怕
<1-4,Leonard (entering on the phone)>But, uh, you understand my trepidation.

18
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:49,900
<1-5,Penny>怎么回事
<1-5,Penny>What's that about?

19
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,300
<1-6,Howard>没头绪
<1-6,Howard>Not a clue.

20
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,500
<1-7,Leonard>不能推迟到春季吗
<1-7,Leonard>Can't we just postpone it till the spring?

21
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,060
<1-7,Leonard>或者明年夏天
<1-7,Leonard>Maybe next summer?

22
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:57,130
<1-8,Sheldon>这个很容易推断
<1-8,Sheldon>This should be fairly easy to deduce.

23
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,330
<1-8,Sheldon>他用左耳听电话
<1-8,Sheldon>He's holding the phone to his left ear.

24
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,230
<1-8,Sheldon>耳朵受同侧脑半球控制  他在用理性
<1-8,Sheldon>Ears do not cross hemispheres, so he's using the analytical

25
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,300
<1-8,Sheldon>而不是感性的大脑半球  表明
<1-8,Sheldon>rather than the emotional side of the brain, suggesting that

26
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,960
<1-8,Sheldon>他与来电方无私人感情
<1-8,Sheldon>he has no personal relationship with the caller.

27
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:10,960
<1-9,Leonard>不  我没发现有这么久了
<1-9,Leonard>No, I didn't realize it had been so long.

28
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:14,330
<1-9,Leonard>当然  我看也没别的选择了 只好硬着头皮上了
<1-9,Leonard>Sure, I guess there's no other choice but to just go ahead and do it.

29
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,430
<1-10,Sheldon>他提到的是他以前做过的事
<1-10,Sheldon>He's referring to an activity he has done before.

30
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,530
<1-10,Sheldon>令人不爽  还得反复做
<1-10,Sheldon>It's unpleasant and needs to be repeated.

31
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,830
<1-10,Sheldon>这就说明是某种
<1-10,Sheldon>This suggests some sort of

32
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:24,100
<1-10,Sheldon>侵入性医学检查  很可能是结肠镜检查
<1-10,Sheldon>invasive medical test, like perhaps a colonoscopy.

33
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,730
<1-11,Leonard>没别的选择吗
<1-11,Leonard>Aren't there any other options?

34
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,100
<1-11,Leonard>空间不大
<1-11,Leonard>There's not a lot of room.

35
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,360
<1-11,Leonard>会很不舒服的
<1-11,Leonard>It's gonna be uncomfortable.

36
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:29,530
<1-12,Sheldon>没错  没错
<1-12,Sheldon>Yes, yes.

37
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,700
<1-12,Sheldon>绝对是结肠镜检查
<1-12,Sheldon>I'm definitely going with colonoscopy.

38
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,760
<1-13,Leonard>好的  拜
<1-13,Leonard>Okay, bye.

39
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:40,560
<1-13,Leonard>我母亲要来了
<1-13,Leonard>My mother's coming to visit.

40
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,530
<1-14,Howard>怎么样  你说对了
<1-14,Howard>How about that, you were right.

41
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:17,110
<2-1,Penny>电梯故障了
<2-1,Penny>It's out of order.

42
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,420
<2-2,Woman>知道  我看到提示了
<2-2,Woman>Yes, I can read the sign.

43
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,060
<2-2,Woman>我在思考其含义
<2-2,Woman>I'm just pondering the implications.

44
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:26,500
<2-3,Penny>含义就是电梯坏了
<2-3,Penny>I think it implies that the elevator doesn't work.

45
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,500
<2-3,Penny>再说一次  我看到提示了
<2-3,Penny>Again, I can read the sign.

46
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,830
<2-4,Woman>但提示和带子上都积了一层灰
<2-4,Woman>But the sign and the tape are coated with a layer of dust,

47
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,460
<2-4,Woman>表明电梯不能用
<2-4,Woman>which indicates that the elevator has been nonfunctional

48
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,000
<2-4,Woman>有好长时间了
<2-4,Woman>for a significant amount of time.

49
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:41,030
<2-4,Woman>这就说明要么这楼的 24到36户人家  我假设的
<2-4,Woman>Which suggests either a remarkable passivity among the, I assume,

50
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,400
<2-4,Woman>基于邮箱的个数
<2-4,Woman>24 to 36 residents of this building,

51
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,000
<2-4,Woman>和典型的城市人口密度得出的
<2-4,Woman>based on the number of mailboxes

52
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,660
<2-4,Woman>都特别懒散
<2-4,Woman>and given typical urban population density

53
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:51,060
<2-4,Woman>要么都同时产生功能性错觉
<2-4,Woman>or a shared delusion of functionality.

54
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,900
<2-5,Penny>你一定是莱纳德的母亲
<2-5,Penny>You must be Leonard's mother.

55
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:59,300
<2-6,Leonard’s Mother>我不确定我一定是  但没错
<2-6,Leonard’s Mother>Oh, I don't know if I must be, but yes.

56
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,700
<2-7,Penny>我是佩妮  他的邻居
<2-7,Penny>Uh, I'm Penny. I'm his neighbor.

57
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,400
<2-8,Leonard’s Mother>贝芙莉·霍夫斯塔德博士
<2-8,Leonard’s Mother>Oh, Dr. Beverly Hofstadter.

58
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,100
<2-9,Penny>很高兴认识你
<2-9,Penny>Oh, nice to meet you.

59
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:08,260
<2-10,Beverley>你喜欢握手  有趣
<2-10,Beverley>Oh, you're a hand shaker. Interesting.

60
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:10,400
<2-11,Penny>跟我来吧
<2-11,Penny>Uh, why don't you come with me.

61
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,160
<2-11,Penny>-我带你去他公寓  -好的
<2-11,Penny>I'll walk you to the apartment. Oh, all right.

62
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:15,330
<2-12,Beverley>路上可以寒暄寒暄吗
<2-12,Beverley>Would you like to exchange pleasantries on the way?

63
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,660
<2-13,Penny>当然  我想可以
<2-13,Penny>Yeah, sure, I guess.

64
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,160
<2-14,Beverley>好的  你先说
<2-14,Beverley>All right, you start.

65
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:20,000
<2-14,Beverley>好的
<2-14,Beverley>Okay.

66
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,330
<2-15,Penny>我总是很好奇
<2-15,Penny>You know, I've always been curious.

67
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,960
<2-15,Penny>莱纳德小时候什么样子
<2-15,Penny>What was Leonard like when he was little?

68
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,260
<2-16,Beverley>我猜你是说年幼时
<2-16,Beverley>Oh, I think you mean young.

69
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:26,630
<2-16,Beverley>他一直很小[个子矮小]
<2-16,Beverley>He's always been little.

70
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,630
<2-17,Penny>好的
<2-17,Penny>Right, okay.

71
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,060
<2-17,Penny>他年幼时什么样子
<2-17,Penny>What was he like when he was young?

72
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:31,060
<2-18,Beverley>你得说得更具体些
<2-18,Beverley>You'll have to be more specific.

73
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,260
<2-19,Penny>好的  大约5  6岁时
<2-19,Penny>Um, okay, like, five or six.

74
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,760
<2-19,Penny>5岁
<2-19,Penny>Five.

75
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:43,030
<2-20,Beverley>在那个年纪  他正陷于
<2-20,Beverley>Oh, well, at that age, he was well enmeshed

76
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,000
<2-20,Beverley>被弗洛伊德称之为
<2-20,Beverley>in what Freud would call the phallic stage

77
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,800
<2-20,Beverley>性心理发展的阴茎期
<2-20,Beverley>of psychosexual development.

78
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,960
<2-20,Beverley>当然是过气的理论  但这孩子的确
<2-20,Beverley>An outmoded theory, of course, but the boy did spend

79
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:52,000
<2-20,Beverley>醒着的大部分时间都紧紧地抓着"小弟弟"
<2-20,Beverley>most of his waking hours with a tight grasp on his penis.

80
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
<2-21,Penny>莱纳德提过你以前是精神病医生
<2-21,Penny>Yeah, Leonard mentioned you were a psychiatrist.

81
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,360
<2-22,Beverley>是我的学位之一
<2-22,Beverley>Well, that is one of my degrees.

82
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:59,400
<2-22,Beverley>我的主修是神经系统学
<2-22,Beverley>My primary field is neuroscience.

83
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,430
<2-23,Penny>我是个演员
<2-23,Penny>Well, I'm an actress.

84
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,760
<2-24,Beverley>为什么
<2-24,Beverley>Why?

85
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:11,330
<2-25,Penny>什么为什么
<2-25,Penny>What do you mean why?

86
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,900
<2-26,Beverley>有研究表明很多从事
<2-26,Beverley>Well, there are studies that suggest that many who go into

87
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:17,760
<2-26,Beverley>演艺事业的人都受外界认同的煎熬
<2-26,Beverley>the performing arts suffer from an external locus of identity.

88
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,730
<2-27,Penny>我不知道那是什么意思
<2-27,Penny>Yeah, I don't know what that means.

89
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,330
<2-28,Beverley>就是说只有别人看重你时 你才看重自己
<2-28,Beverley>Well, it means you value yourself only as others value you,

90
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,200
<2-28,Beverley>一般是童年情感需要得不到满足的结果
<2-28,Beverley>which is often the result of unmet childhood emotional needs.

91
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:35,760
<2-29,Penny>我有个很棒的童年
<2-29,Penny>Oh, well, I had a wonderful childhood.

92
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,830
<2-30,Beverley>和我说说
<2-30,Beverley>Tell me about it.

93
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,160
<2-31,Penny>我知道我爸爸想要个男孩
<2-31,Penny>I know my dad wanted a boy.

94
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:47,400
<2-31,Penny>我就拼命让自己变成运动能手
<2-31,Penny>I-I just, I tried being good at sports,

95
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,900
<2-31,Penny>但我讨厌脏兮兮的
<2-31,Penny>but I hated getting dirty!

96
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,960
<2-32,Beverley>之后  我猜  你进入青春期
<2-32,Beverley>And then, I'm assuming, you entered adolescence.

97
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:57,500
<2-33,Penny>在我戴上少女乳罩前  他一直称我为强击手
<2-33,Penny>He called me Slugger until I got my first training bra.

98
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,530
<2-33,Penny>之后就不再和我一起打球
<2-33,Penny>And then he just stopped playing catch with me.

99
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,900
<2-33,Penny>我也不再是强击手了
<2-33,Penny>I wasn't Slugger anymore.

100
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,000
<2-33,Penny>你母亲来了
<2-33,Penny>Your mother's here!

101
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,700
<2-34,Beverley>如果你想和那女孩性交
<2-34,Beverley>If you want to have intercourse with that girl,

102
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,630
<2-34,Beverley>查一下她父亲用哪种古龙水就行
<2-34,Beverley>find out what kind of cologne her fathore.

103
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:24,330
<2-35,Leonard>妈妈  很高兴见到您
<2-35,Leonard>Good to see you, Mother.

104
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,530
<3-1,Leonard>妈妈  您的茶沏好了
<3-1,Leonard>Here's your tea, Mother.

105
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,860
<3-2,Beverley>-乌龙茶  -是的
<3-2,Beverley>- Oolong? - Yes.

106
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,300
<3-4,Beverley>-散装的  不是茶包  -是的
<3-4,Beverley>- Loose, not bagged? - Yes.

107
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,700
<3-7,Leonard>-泡了三分钟  -是的
<3-7,Leonard>- Steeped three minutes? - Yes.

108
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,130
<3-8,Beverley>-百分之二的牛奶  -是的
<3-8,Beverley>- Two-percent milk? - Yes.

109
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,560
<3-11,Leonard>-分别加热  -是的
<3-11,Leonard>- Warmed separately? - Yes.

110
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:35,860
<3-12,Beverley>-一勺糖  -是的
<3-12,Beverley>- One teaspoon sugar? - Yes.

111
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:36,860
<3-14,Beverley>-粗糖  -是的
<3-14,Beverley>- Raw sugar? - Yes.

112
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,800
<3-16,Beverley>已经凉了
<3-16,Beverley>It's cold.

113
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:46,730
<3-17,Leonard>我重头再来
<3-17,Leonard>I'll start again.

114
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:49,900
<3-18,Sheldon>我也觉得他有问题
<3-18,Sheldon>I have the same problem with him.

115
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,530
<3-18,Sheldon>我的理论是他不够专注
<3-18,Sheldon>My theory is that his lack of focus

116
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,830
<3-18,Sheldon>因为性欲过剩
<3-18,Sheldon>stems from an over-developed sex drive.

117
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,000
<3-19,Beverley>我真不知道他是从哪遗传的
<3-19,Beverley>Oh, I don't know where he would've gotten that.

118
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,100
<3-19,Beverley>在我和他父亲圆满的婚姻之余
<3-19,Beverley>Aside from a pro forma consummation of our marriage,

119
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:07,500
<3-19,Beverley>我们只为了生育下一代 而进行性行为
<3-19,Beverley>his father and I only had intercourse for the purposes of reproduction.

120
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,300
<3-20,Sheldon>这种安排太有效率了
<3-20,Sheldon>That seems a fairly efficient arrangement.

121
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,700
<3-21,Beverley>我们也这么认为
<3-21,Beverley>Yes, we think so.

122
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,130
<3-21,Beverley>我们都因此发表了论文
<3-21,Beverley>We've both done papers on it.

123
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,700
<3-21,Beverley>我的论文是从神经系统科学的角度写的
<3-21,Beverley>Mine from the neuroscientific point of view

124
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,830
<3-21,Beverley>他父亲是从人类学的角度
<3-21,Beverley>and his from an anthropological.

125

143
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:07,300
<3-33,Leonard>能谈谈不这么私人的吗
<3-33,Leonard>Maybe something less personal.

144
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,600
<3-34,Beverley>你叔叔弗洛德死了
<3-34,Beverley>Your Uncle Floyd died.

00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,960
<3-36,Beverley>我得去排尿了
<3-36,Beverley>I have to urinate.

149
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:26,860
<3-37,Sheldon>真是个超赞的女人
<3-37,Sheldon>What a remarkable woman.

150
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:30,930
<3-38,Leonard>我也觉得你们会很投缘
<3-38,Leonard>Yeah, I-I thought you guys might hit it off.

151
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,030
<3-39,Sheldon>我真嫉妒你的童年生活
<3-39,Sheldon>I envy you your childhood.

152
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,460
<3-40,Leonard>真不想告诉你  我童年唯一的美好回忆
<3-40,Leonard>I hate to tell you, but the only warm memories

153

<3-40,Leonard>都是和我叔叔弗洛德在一起的
<3-40,Leonard>I have of my childhood are of my Uncle Floyd.

154
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,030
<3-41,Sheldon>你记错了吧
<3-41,Sheldon>You're clearly misremembering.

155
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,130
<3-41,Sheldon>你母亲聪明绝顶
<3-41,Sheldon>Your mother is brilliant,

156
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,230
<3-41,Sheldon>具有高超的分析力和洞察力
<3-41,Sheldon>analytical, insightful.

157
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,930
<3-41,Sheldon>我打赌就算你不肯吃汤菜
<3-41,Sheldon>And I'm betting she never hit you with a Bible because

158
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,100
<3-41,Sheldon>她也不会用圣经打你
<3-41,Sheldon>you wouldn't eat your Brussels sprouts.

159
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,360
<3-42,Leonard>谢尔顿  你对你母亲的评价有失偏颇
<3-42,Leonard>Sheldon, you don't give your mother enough credit.

160
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,230
<3-42,Leonard>她是个有爱心的人
<3-42,Leonard>She's warm, she's loving,

161
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,100
<3-42,Leonard>她不会在你脑袋上贴上电极
<3-42,Leonard>she doesn't glue electrodes to your head

162
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:59,000
<3-42,Leonard>当你学着上厕所时测量你的脑电波
<3-42,Leonard>to measure your brain waves while potty training.

163
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,530
<3-43,Sheldon>你很幸运
<3-43,Sheldon>You were lucky.

164
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,360
<3-43,Sheldon>我小的时候  如果想做脑电图扫描
<3-43,Sheldon>When I was a kid, if I wanted an EEG,

165
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:04,900
<3-43,Sheldon>我不得不自己贴电极
<3-43,Sheldon>I had to attach my own electrodes.

166
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,630
<4-1,Howard>霍夫斯塔德博士
<4-1,Howard>So, Dr. Hofstadter,

167
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,060
<4-1,Howard>莱纳德很少谈及
<4-1,Howard>Leonard rarely talks about

168
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:13,960
<4-1,Howard>他成就颇高的姐姐和弟弟
<4-1,Howard>his incredibly successful brother and sister.

169
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,630
<4-2,Leonard>拜托  霍华德  别提这个了
<4-2,Leonard>Please, don't go there, Howard.

170
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,200
<4-3,Howard>我了解到
<4-3,Howard>I understand that,

171
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:22,600
<4-3,Howard>不像莱纳德  他们 都是各自领域的权威人物
<4-3,Howard>unlike Leonard, they're at the top of their respective fields.

172
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:25,700
<4-4,Leonard>你个烂人
<4-4,Leonard>Boy, you suck.

173
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,360
<4-5,Beverley>莱纳德的弟弟迈克尔
<4-5,Beverley>Well, Leonard's younger brother, Michael,

174
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:29,530
<4-5,Beverley>是哈佛的法学终身教授
<4-5,Beverley>is a tenured law professor at Harvard,

175
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,800
<4-5,Beverley>他的姐姐刚刚成功地
<4-5,Beverley>and his sister just successfully grew

176
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:34,860
<4-5,Beverley>在一只青春期的长臂猿体内植入人类胰脏
<4-5,Beverley>a human pancreas in an adolescent gibbon.

177
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:38,300
<4-6,Howard>她很快就能治愈糖尿病了
<4-6,Howard>So, she's close to curing diabetes?

178
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,560
<4-7,Beverley>在一只十几岁的长臂猿体内植入胰脏还有别的原因么
<4-7,Beverley>Why else would you grow a pancreas in a teenaged gibbon?

179
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:44,530
<4-8,Howard>你一定很为他们骄傲吧
<4-8,Howard>Wow, you must be very proud.

180
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,530
<4-8,Howard>为什么
<4-8,Howard>Why?

181
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,060
<4-9,Beverley>又不是我的成就
<4-9,Beverley>They're not my accomplishments.

182
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:50,300
<4-9,Beverley>我得去排尿了
<4-9,Beverley>I have to urinate.

183
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:55,630
<4-10,Leonard>你为什么这么做
<4-10,Leonard>Why are you doing this?

184
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,800
<4-11,Howard>你知道游戏规则
<4-11,Howard>You know the rules.

185
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:59,530
<4-11,Howard>你带母亲来上班  就等着受罪吧
<4-11,Howard>You brought your mom to work-- you must suffer.

186
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,300
<4-12,Sheldon>莱纳德  我不知道
<4-12,Sheldon>Leonard, I had no idea

187
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,800
<4-12,Sheldon>你兄妹的成就都比你高这么多
<4-12,Sheldon>your siblings were so much more successful than you.

188
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,430
<4-13,Raj>你就像是霍夫斯塔德家族里的怪物查查比[星战里的马脸怪物]
<4-13,Raj>Yeah, you're like the Jar Jar Binks of the Hofstadter family.

189
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:15,260
<4-14,Howard>我觉得[模仿查查比的牙买加口音] 你看起来好悲哀
<4-14,Howard>Oh, meesa think yousa lookin' so so sad.

190
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:19,260
<4-15,Leonard>我的朋友不该嘲笑我
<4-15,Leonard>You know, rather than mock me, my friends might realize

191
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:22,160
<4-15,Leonard>应该懂得我有多难  尽力帮我
<4-15,Leonard>that this is difficult and try to help me through it.

192
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:24,700
<4-16,Raj>我觉得嘲笑你更有趣
<4-16,Raj>Nope, I think mocking you is more fun.

193
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,730
<4-17,Howard>下一次  看你还带不带妈妈来上班
<4-17,Howard>Next time, don't yousa bring mama to work.

194
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,760
<4-17,Howard>如何
<4-17,Howard>Okee-day?

195
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:33,260
<4-18,Leonard>很快嘛
<4-18,Leonard>That was fast.

196
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:34,930
<4-19,Beverley>中间的坑被人占了
<4-19,Beverley>Oh, the middle stall was occupied.

197
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,460
<4-19,Beverley>我得一会再去
<4-19,Beverley>I'll have to try again later.

198
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,800
<4-20,Sheldon>非常能理解
<4-20,Sheldon>That's totally understandable.

199
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,830
<4-20,Sheldon>排空膀胱  就好像搞房地产
<4-20,Sheldon>In bladder voiding, as in real estate,

200
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,630
<4-20,Sheldon>地点最重要
<4-20,Sheldon>it's location, location, location.

201
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,030
<4-21,Beverley>说到哪了
<4-21,Beverley>So, where were we?

202
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:49,200
<4-22,Leonard>霍华德还和老妈住在一起   而拉杰不喝醉 就不会和女人说话
<4-22,Leonard>Howard lives with his mother and Raj can't speak to women unless he's drunk.

203
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,860
<4-22,Leonard>说吧
<4-22,Leonard>Go.

204
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,330
<4-23,Beverley>很吸引人
<4-23,Beverley>That's fascinating.

205
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,260
<4-23,Beverley>选择性缄默症非常稀有
<4-23,Beverley>Selective mutism is quite rare.

206
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,760
<4-23,Beverley>另一方面  一个成年犹太男性
<4-23,Beverley>On the other hand, an adult Jewish male

207
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,260
<4-23,Beverley>和母亲同住已经普遍到
<4-23,Beverley>living with his mother is so common

208
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:03,360
<4-23,Beverley>近似于社会学的陈词滥调了
<4-23,Beverley>it borders on sociological cliché.

209
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:07,160
<4-24,Howard>只是暂时的  我有付房租
<4-24,Howard>It's just temporary; I pay rent.

210
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:09,800
<4-25,Leonard>他现在的房间就是以前放婴儿床的
<4-25,Leonard>He lives in the same room where his bassinet was.

211
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,500
<4-26,Beverley>无论是选择性缄默症
<4-26,Beverley>You know, both selective mutism

212
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,960
<4-26,Beverley>还是无法离开母亲独自生活
<4-26,Beverley>and an inability to separate from one's mother

213
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,260
<4-26,Beverley>都可能是源于对女性的病理性恐惧
<4-26,Beverley>can stem from a pathological fear of women.

214
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:17,830
<4-26,Beverley>这或许可以解释为何
<4-26,Beverley>It might explain why

215
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,530
<4-26,Beverley>你们俩建立一段同性恋代替性婚姻关系
<4-26,Beverley>the two of you have created an ersatz homosexual marriage

216
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,360
<4-26,Beverley>来满足自己对亲密关系的饥渴
<4-26,Beverley>to satisfy your need for intimacy.

217
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,460
<4-27,Howard>你说什么
<4-27,Howard>Say what?

218
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,400
<4-27,Howard>那不是等于我说的嘛
<4-27,Howard>That's basically what I just said.

219
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:37,860
<4-28,Leonard>你带你"老公"一起工作
<4-28,Leonard>You brought your husband to work.

220
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:39,330
<4-28,Leonard>你知道游戏规则
<4-28,Leonard>You know the rules.

221
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,030
<4-28,Leonard>我觉得你们现在看起来也很悲哀  对吧
<4-28,Leonard>Meesa thinking yousa looking pretty sad now too, betcha, betcha.

222
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,060
<4-28,Leonard>莱纳德  已经1点了
<4-28,Leonard>Leonard, it's 1:00.

223
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:49,300
<4-29,Beverley>1点不是要带我参观你的实验室吗
<4-29,Beverley>Weren't you going to show me your laboratory at 1:00?

224
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,660
<4-30,Leonard>别急  妈妈
<4-30,Leonard>There's no hurry, Mother.

225
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:52,400
<4-30,Leonard>再说一点他们之间的"地下恋情"
<4-30,Leonard>Tell them more about their secret love for each other.

226
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,200
<4-30,Leonard>但已经1点了
<4-30,Leonard>But it's 1:00.

227
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,560
<4-31,Beverley>你应该在1点带我去参观你的实验室
<4-31,Beverley>You were going to show me your laboratory at 1:00.

228
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:57,660
<4-32,Sheldon>她的理由无懈可击
<4-32,Sheldon>Her reasoning is unassailable.

229
00:10:57,730 --> 00:10:59,700
<4-32,Sheldon>已经1点了
<4-32,Sheldon>It is 1:00.

230
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:03,330
<4-33,Leonard>好吧  咱们走
<4-33,Leonard>Fine. Let's go.

231
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:07,100
<4-33,Leonard>你肯定会觉得我的工作很有趣
<4-33,Leonard>I think you'll find my work pretty interesting.

232
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,260
<4-33,Leonard>我正在尝试复制意大利人从碘化钠晶体里
<4-33,Leonard>I'm attempting to replicate the dark matter signal

233
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:12,030
<4-33,Leonard>找到的暗物质信号
<4-33,Leonard>found in sodium iodide crystals by the Italians.

234
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,860
<4-34,Beverley>没有原创性研究
<4-34,Beverley>So, no original research?

235
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:15,400
<4-35,Leonard>没有
<4-35,Leonard>No.

236
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,760
<4-36,Beverley>那我去看还有什么意义
<4-36,Beverley>Well, what's the point of my seeing it?

237
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:20,630
<4-36,Beverley>我直接看意大利人的报导不就行了
<4-36,Beverley>I could just read the paper the Italians wrote.

238
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:23,960
<4-37,Howard>强烈声明
<4-37,Howard>Just for the record,

239
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:27,100
<4-37,Howard>我们没有什么同性恋代替性关系
<4-37,Howard>we're not in an ersatz homosexual relationship.

240
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,830
<4-38,Raj>你刚怎么不跟她说
<4-38,Raj>Well, then why didn't you say that to her?

241
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,140
<4-39,Howard>为什么这老是我的责任
<4-39,Howard>Why is it always my responsibility?

242
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,080
<4-40,Raj>并非老是你的责任
<4-40,Raj>It's not always your responsibility.

243
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:37,180
<4-40,Raj>我保证  这和你上周在漫画书店干的事情没两样
<4-40,Raj>I swear, this is the same thing you did at the comic book store last week.

244
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:42,740
<4-41,Howard>难以置信你会提起这件事
<4-41,Howard>I can't believe you're bringing that up.

245
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,640
<4-42,Raj>才不是我提的  是你才对
<4-42,Raj>I didn't bring it up. You did.

246
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:47,910
<4-43,Howard>我们以后再说
<4-43,Howard>We'll talk about this later.

247
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:50,680
<4-44,Raj>你老这么糊弄我  从来没这么做过
<4-44,Raj>You always say that, but we never do.

248
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:58,340
<4-45,Sheldon>你们居然去漫画书店不带上我
<4-45,Sheldon>You went to the comic book store without me.

249
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:07,080
<5-2,Leonard>你有酒吗
<5-2,Leonard>You got alcohol?

250
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,410
<5-3,Penny>-你老妈还没走  -没错
<5-3,Penny>Your mom still here? Yep.

251
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,080
<5-5,Penny>进来吧
<5-5,Penny>Come on in.

252
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,040
<5-5,Penny>等等  她不会来这儿找你吧
<5-5,Penny>Wait, wait, she's not gonna come here looking for you, is she?

253
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:17,210
<5-6,Leonard>别担心  她拖了谢尔顿去医院做脑扫描
<5-6,Leonard>Relax. She took Sheldon to the hospital to get a brain scan.

254
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,210
<5-7,Penny>天啊  怎么了
<5-7,Penny>Oh, my God. What happened?

255
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,040
<5-8,Leonard>没什么  老妈喜欢观察大脑
<5-8,Leonard>Nothing. Mother likes looking at brains

256
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,980
<5-8,Leonard>谢尔顿则想做脑扫描
<5-8,Leonard>and Sheldon likes getting his brain scanned.

257
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,480
<5-9,Penny>一个愿打  一个愿挨
<5-9,Penny>Geez, what a fun couple.

258
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,240
<5-10,Leonard>她只在这儿呆了一天半
<5-10,Leonard>She's only been here a day and a half

259
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:31,080
<5-10,Leonard>我已经开始认真考虑把酒精中毒
<5-10,Leonard>and I'm seriously considering alcoholism

260
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,540
<5-10,Leonard>作为我下半生的事业
<5-10,Leonard>as a new career path.

261
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:35,340
<5-11,Penny>我昨天只和她聊了5分钟
<5-11,Penny>Hey, I talked to her for five minutes yesterday

262
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:37,610
<5-11,Penny>就一直处于半醉状态
<5-11,Penny>and I've been half bombed ever since.

263
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,580
<5-12,Leonard>你不能让她进驻你的大脑
<5-12,Leonard>You can't let her get into your head.

264
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,180
<5-13,Penny>我的大脑  那你的呢
<5-13,Penny>My head, what about yours?

265
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,340
<5-14,Leonard>已经太迟了
<5-14,Leonard>It's too late for me.

266
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:46,780
<5-14,Leonard>我的大脑就是她的避暑山庄
<5-14,Leonard>My head is her summer house.

267
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:49,540
<5-15,Penny>可她并没有错
<5-15,Penny>She was right, you know.

268
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:52,610
<5-15,Penny>外界对我的认同都写在脸上了
<5-15,Penny>The locus of my identity is totally exterior to me.

269
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,110
<5-16,Leonard>已经被她洗脑了  你好  老妈
<5-16,Leonard>Oh, yeah, there she is. Hi, Mom.

270
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,540
<5-17,Penny>你知道我整个早上去哪了吗
<5-17,Penny>I mean, do you know where I was all morning?

271
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:01,310
<5-17,Penny>和50个金发美女抢试镜
<5-17,Penny>Auditioning with 50 other blondes

272
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,910
<5-17,Penny>为了一个愚蠢的抗抑郁药广告
<5-17,Penny>for some stupid antidepressant commercial.

273
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,510
<5-17,Penny>为了什么
<5-17,Penny>And for what?

274
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:08,680
<5-17,Penny>就为了最终得到我爸的认可
<5-17,Penny>So I'll finally get my daddy's approval?

275
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:09,940
<5-18,Leonard>你抢到那个角色了吗
<5-18,Leonard>Did you get the part?

276
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:13,510
<5-19,Penny>没有  他们说我太活泼了
<5-19,Penny>No, they said I was too perky.

277
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:19,180
<5-20,Leonard>你想谈谈没有亲情的生活
<5-20,Leonard>You want to talk about not getting love from a parent.

278
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,040
<5-20,Leonard>你知道我的小时候
<5-20,Leonard>You know what I used to do when I was little

279
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:23,610
<5-20,Leonard>想获得人体接触做了什么吗
<5-20,Leonard>to have some sensation of human contact?

280
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,140
<5-21,Penny>知道  你死抓着"小弟弟"不放
<5-21,Penny>Yeah, you grabbed your penis and wouldn't let go.

281
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,340
<5-21,Penny>你老妈告诉我的
<5-21,Penny>Your mother told me.

282
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:34,610
<5-22,Leonard>不出所料
<5-22,Leonard>Of course she did.

283
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,280
<5-22,Leonard>但我想说的不是这个
<5-22,Leonard>Anyway, that's not what I was gonna say.

284
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:40,840
<5-22,Leonard>我10岁时 造了一个"拥抱机"
<5-22,Leonard>When I was ten years old, i built a hugging machine.

285
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:43,010
<5-23,Penny>"拥抱机"
<5-23,Penny>A hugging machine?

286
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,580
<5-24,Leonard>对  我找了个裁缝用的假人
<5-24,Leonard>Yeah. I got a dressmaker's mannequin,

287
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,380
<5-24,Leonard>在里面塞一条电热毯
<5-24,Leonard>I stuffed it with an electric blanket

288
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,340
<5-24,Leonard>就能有温度  还装了两只无线电控制的手臂
<5-24,Leonard>so it would be warm, and built two radio-controlled arms

289
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:52,480
<5-24,Leonard>能抱我  拍我的背
<5-24,Leonard>that would hug me and pat my back.

290
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,510
<5-25,Penny>好悲哀
<5-25,Penny>Oh, that is so sad.

291
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,610
<5-26,Leonard>-你知道最悲哀的是什么吗  -什么
<5-26,Leonard>You know what the saddest part was? What?

292
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,510
<5-28,Leonard>我爸爸常把它借过去
<5-28,Leonard>My father used to borrow it.

293
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:05,740
<6-1,Beverley>你的扫描资料会对我的研究非常有帮助
<6-1,Beverley>Your scan data will be very helpful to my research.

294
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:07,540
<6-1,Beverley>你有一颗非比寻常的大脑
<6-1,Beverley>You have a remarkable brain.

295
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:10,310
<6-2,Sheldon>必须的
<6-2,Sheldon>I know.

296
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,240
<6-2,Sheldon>虽然我不喜欢我的右额叶
<6-2,Sheldon>Although I've always hated

297
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:15,680
<6-2,Sheldon>在X光片上的效果
<6-2,Sheldon>how my right frontal lobe looks in pictures.

298
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,580
<6-3,Beverley>男人抱怨最多的
<6-3,Beverley>Common complaint among men.

299
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,810
<6-3,Beverley>总嫌东西不够大
<6-3,Beverley>Nothing's ever big enough.

300
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,580
<6-3,Beverley>除非是个肿瘤
<6-3,Beverley>Except when they get a tumor.

301
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,680
<6-3,Beverley>你就不会听到这种抱怨了
<6-3,Beverley>Then you never hear the end of it.

302
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:27,840
<6-4,Sheldon>希望改日能看看你的脑扫描
<6-4,Sheldon>I'd love to see a scan of your brain sometime.

303
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,180
<6-5,Beverley>我会发个链接给你
<6-5,Beverley>Oh, I'll send you a link,

304
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,340
<6-5,Beverley>但就生理学来说  我的脑扫描相当无趣
<6-5,Beverley>but its physiology is fairly unimpressive.

305
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:33,340
<6-6,Sheldon>真难以置信
<6-6,Sheldon>Oh, I can't believe that.

306
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:35,780
<6-7,Beverley>你不愿接受经验实据
<6-7,Beverley>Your unwillingness to accept empirical evidence

307
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,740
<6-7,Beverley>说明一种奉承之举
<6-7,Beverley>suggests an attempt at flattery.

308
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:41,410
<6-8,Sheldon>我抱歉
<6-8,Sheldon>My apologies.

309
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,240
<6-8,Sheldon>我和你儿子住在一起太久了
<6-8,Sheldon>I've been living with your son too long.

310
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:45,440
<6-8,Sheldon>染了些坏习惯
<6-8,Sheldon>Gotten into some bad habits.

311
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,240
<6-9,Beverley>可以理解
<6-9,Beverley>Understandable.

312
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:50,680
<6-10,Sheldon>-能给你沏杯茶吗  -我怀疑你的能力
<6-10,Sheldon>Can I make you a cup of tea? I doubt it,

313
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:53,680
<6-11,Beverley>不过有机会的人只有你了
<6-11,Beverley>but if anyone has a chance, it's probably you.

314
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,580
<6-12,Sheldon>和你呆在一起很舒服
<6-12,Sheldon>I feel very comfortable around you.

315
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,040
<6-13,Beverley>我也有同感
<6-13,Beverley>I feel very comfortable around you, too.

316
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,440
<6-14,Sheldon>令人吃惊
<6-14,Sheldon>It's surprising

317
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:07,380
<6-14,Sheldon>因为我通常跟任何人在一起都觉得
<6-14,Sheldon>because I generally don't feel comfortable around,

318
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,780
<6-14,Sheldon>不舒服
<6-14,Sheldon>well, anyone.

319
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,710
<6-15,Beverley>我也是
<6-15,Beverley>Nor I.

320
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:14,910
<6-16,Sheldon>像我们这么独特的两个人
<6-16,Sheldon>What are the odds that two individuals

321
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,610
<6-16,Sheldon>通过像你儿子这样的庸人
<6-16,Sheldon>as unique as ourselves would be connected

322
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,310
<6-16,Sheldon>而联系上的几率有多大
<6-16,Sheldon>by someone as comparatively workaday as your son?

323
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:24,110
<6-17,Beverley>那是个修辞学观点呢
<6-17,Beverley>Is that a rhetorical point

324
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:27,240
<6-17,Beverley>还是你想算算
<6-17,Beverley>or would you like to do the math?

325
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:29,780
<6-18,Sheldon>我想算一算
<6-18,Sheldon>I'd like to do the math.

326
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:34,340
<6-19,Beverley>我也想
<6-19,Beverley>I'd like that, too.

327
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:52,710
<7-1,Penny>好了  这次
<7-1,Penny>Okay, now this time, Uh-huh.

328
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:57,380
<7-3,Penny>你要舔掉我脖子的盐
<7-3,Penny>you're gonna lick the salt...off my neck...

329
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,740
<7-3,Penny>喝一杯
<7-3,Penny>...do the shot...

330
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,680
<7-3,Penny>再咬一口酸橙
<7-3,Penny>...and then bite the lime.

331
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:14,110
<7-4,Leonard>抱歉  "舔"后的我都没听到
<7-4,Leonard>I'm sorry, I didn't hear anything after "lick."

332
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:18,340
<7-5,Penny>脖子  酒  酸橙
<7-5,Penny>Neck, shot, lime.

333
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:28,040
<7-5,Penny>好了  酒  酸橙
<7-5,Penny>Okay, shot, lime.

334
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:29,640
<7-5,Penny>对
<7-5,Penny>Right.

335
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,410
<7-6,Leonard>酸橙在哪
<7-6,Leonard>Where's the lime?

336
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:43,980
<7-6,Leonard>我们一起吃
<7-6,Leonard>Oh, okay, we're sharing.

337
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:03,580
<8-1,Sheldon>你觉得怎样
<8-1,Sheldon>So, what do you think?

338
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,380
<8-2,Beverley>我被深深吸引了
<8-2,Beverley>I'm very tempted.

339
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:11,310
<8-2,Beverley>我只是不确定和我儿子的室友 是否合适
<8-2,Beverley>I'm just not sure it's appropriate with my son's roommate.

340
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,410
<8-3,Sheldon>通常  我也会有同感
<8-3,Sheldon>Normally, I'd feel the same way.

341
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,310
<8-3,Sheldon>不过从我们身上的一切来看
<8-3,Sheldon>But based on everything I've observed about us,

342
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:20,140
<8-3,Sheldon>我无法自持地推测我们俩会很适合
<8-3,Sheldon>I can't help but speculate we'd be very good together.

343
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:22,710
<8-4,Beverley>确实  我也这样觉得
<8-4,Beverley>True. I've had a similar observation.

344
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:27,780
<8-4,Beverley>绝对是我和我老公都没做过的事
<8-4,Beverley>It's certainly something I could never do with my husband.

345
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:31,440
<8-5,Sheldon>第一次尝试时我也很犹豫
<8-5,Sheldon>I was hesitant the first time I tried it,

346
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:34,340
<8-5,Sheldon>但我体验了一次未曾料到的
<8-5,Sheldon>but I experienced an unanticipated

347
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:37,910
<8-5,Sheldon>大量的安多芬[能产生快感]释放
<8-5,Sheldon>and remarkable release of endorphins.

348
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,110
<8-5,Sheldon>非常令人满意
<8-5,Sheldon>It's quite satisfying.

349
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,810
<8-6,Beverley>我明白你的用意
<8-6,Beverley>I see what you're doing.

350
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:48,510
<8-6,Beverley>你很想对我做神经学研究
<8-6,Beverley>You're appealing to the neuroscientific researcher in me.

351
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:52,510
<8-7,Sheldon>你完全看穿我了  不是吗
<8-7,Sheldon>You see right through me, don't you?

352
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:55,080
<8-8,Beverley>只能在电脑断层扫描仪上
<8-8,Beverley>Only when you're in a CAT scanner.

353
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:07,410
<9-1,Leonard>梦想就要成真了
<9-1,Leonard>This is actually gonna happen.

354
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,740
<9-2,Penny>亲爱的  嘘  嘘  嘘
<9-2,Penny>Honey, shush, shush, shush, shush, shush.

355
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:13,110
<9-3,Leonard>你嘘嘘  我开心  我想说
<9-3,Leonard>You shush, I'm happy. I want to talk about it.

356
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,840
<9-3,Leonard>你知道我妈会说什么吗
<9-3,Leonard>You know what my mother would say about this?

357
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:17,110

<9-3,Leonard>and I was not loved by my mother,

359
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:22,280
<9-3,Leonard>做爱是我们弥补儿时没有得到的 亲密关系的方法
<9-3,Leonard>that having sex is our way of making up for the intimacy we didn't get as children.

<9-5,Leonard>前戏吗
<9-5,Leonard>Foreplay?

363
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:34,040
<9-6,Penny>也就是说 你不是在和我做爱
<9-6,Penny>So you're saying you're not having sex with me,

364
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:35,880
<9-6,Penny>是和你妈做爱吗

<10-1,Penny>Get out!

369

<11-2,Beverley>那又不是我能控制的
<11-2,Beverley>That's not really in my control, is it?
