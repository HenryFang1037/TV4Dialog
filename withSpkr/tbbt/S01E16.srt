<1-1,Penny>伙计们  伙计们
<1-1,Penny>Hey, guys. guys.

4
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:11,800
<1-1,Penny>有几个女服务生要我来问你们一声
<1-1,Penny>Some of the other waitresses wanted me to ask you something.

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,960
<1-2,Leonard>这个叫"Tresling"  它是将掰手腕需要的力量
<1-2,Leonard>It's called Tresling. It combines the physical strength of arm wrestling

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,560
<1-3,Howard>与玩俄罗斯方块需要的头脑敏捷度相结合的终极运动
<1-3,Howard>with the mental agility of Tetris into the ultimate spots.

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,690
<1-3,Howard>是  很棒
<1-3,Howard>Yeah, that's terrific.

8
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:22,300
<1-4,Penny>但她们是要我来问  你们是否可以打住了
<1-4,Penny>but they wanted me to ask you to cut it the hell out.

9
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:24,940
<1-4,Penny>好  来吧  大伙  来了
<1-4,Penny>Great. Come here, guys. Come on.

10
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:29,220
<1-4,Penny>祝你生日快乐
<1-4,Penny>Happy birthday to you.

11
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,140
<1-5,Sheldon>我们还是结束吧  打成平手  俄罗斯方块你赢了
<1-5,Sheldon>We might as well stop. It's a stalemate. You're beating me in Tetris,

12
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,770
<1-5,Sheldon>你的上肢力量就跟个同性恋差不多
<1-5,Sheldon>but you've got the upper body strength of a Keebler elf.

13
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,820
<1-6,Raj>同性恋?  我现在就干你
<1-6,Raj>Keebler elf? I've got your Keebler elf right here.

14
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:44,150
<1-6,Raj>好  打成平手
<1-6,Raj>Okay, it's a stalemate.

15
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:48,080
<1-7,Penny>里奥纳德  礼拜六我们会
<1-7,Penny>So, leonard, will we be seeing you

16
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,180
<1-7,Penny>在这里看到你和你的免费生日奶酪蛋糕吗
<1-7,Penny>on saturday for your free birthday cheesecake?

17
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:51,110
<1-8,Sheldon>他不能吃奶酪蛋糕
<1-8,Sheldon>He can't eat cheesecake.

18
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:52,550
<1-8,Sheldon>他乳糖过敏的
<1-8,Sheldon>He's lactose intolerant.

19
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:53,930
<1-9,Penny>好  那可以要胡萝卜蛋糕
<1-9,Penny>Okay, he can have carrot cake.

20
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:55,270
<1-10,Sheldon>那蛋糕上面装饰的奶油奶酪呢
<1-10,Sheldon>What about the cream cheese frosting?

21
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:56,620
<1-11,Penny>他可以掰下来不吃
<1-11,Penny>He can scrape it off.

22
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:59,300
<1-12,Leonard>不提蛋糕了
<1-12,Leonard>Forget about the cake.

23
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,240
<1-12,Leonard>你怎么会知道礼拜六我生日?
<1-12,Leonard>How do you know that my birthday's saturday?

24
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,670
<1-13,Penny>我占卜过你的星座  还记得?
<1-13,Penny>I did your horoscope, remember?

25
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:03,820
<1-13,Penny>我还想占卜你们每一个的
<1-13,Penny>I was going to do everybody's,

26
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:06,560
<1-13,Penny>直到被谢尔顿那典型且神经兮兮的理论所打断
<1-13,Penny>Until sheldon went on one of his typical psychotic rants.

27
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:08,200
<1-13,Penny>正式申明下
<1-13,Penny>For the record,

28
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,670
<1-14,Sheldon>那"神经兮兮的理论"是贝尔特拉姆·福尔
<1-14,Sheldon>"that psychotic rant" was a concise summation

29
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:13,600
<1-14,Sheldon>所做研究的简要概括
<1-14,Sheldon>Of the research of bertram forer, who in 1948,

30
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,560
<1-14,Sheldon>他于1948年通过精心设计的实验
<1-14,Sheldon>Proved conclusively through meticulously designed

31
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,260
<1-14,Sheldon>结论性地证明占星术只不过
<1-14,Sheldon>Experiments that astrology is nothing

32
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:19,260
<1-14,Sheldon>是伪科学的噱头
<1-14,Sheldon>but pseudo-scientific hokum.

33
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,090
<1-15,Penny>叽里呱啦叽里呱啦  典型的金牛座
<1-15,Penny>Blah, blah, blah. typical taurus.

34
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:24,150
<1-15,Penny>说真的  我们是不是周六见?
<1-15,Penny>So, seriously. are we going to see you saturday?

35
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,150
<1-17,Penny>-我想不是吧  -为什么?
<1-17,Penny>Uh, I don't inink so. why not?

36
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:27,440
<1-18,Leonard>我不庆祝生日的
<1-18,Leonard>I don't celebrate my birthday.

37
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,980
<1-19,Penny>开玩笑  你不会的
<1-19,Penny>Shut up. yeah, you do.

38
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,370
<1-20,Leonard>这没什么大不了  我一直都是这样的
<1-20,Leonard>It's no big deal; it's just the way I was raised.

39
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,770
<1-20,Leonard>我父母只会在我取得成就的时候庆祝
<1-20,Leonard>My parents focused on celebrating achievements,

40
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:35,040
<1-20,Leonard>而被逐出产道
<1-20,Leonard>And being expelled from a birth canal

41
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:37,040
<1-20,Leonard>显然不算其中一项
<1-20,Leonard>was not considered one of them.

42
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,640
<1-21,Penny>这太可笑了
<1-21,Penny>That's so silly.

43
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,720
<1-22,Sheldon>事实上  这还是一篇有理有据的文章
<1-22,Sheldon>It's actually based on very sound theories.

44
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,550
<1-22,Sheldon>他母亲发表在报纸上的
<1-22,Sheldon>His mother published a paper on it.

45
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:44,670
<1-23,Penny>这篇文章什么标题
<1-23,Penny>Well, what was it called?

46
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,270
<1-23,Penny>"我讨厌我儿子  因此他不能吃蛋糕"?
<1-23,Penny>"i hate my son and that's why he can't have cake"?

47
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:49,660
<1-24,Sheldon>显然易见  这是正确的
<1-24,Sheldon>It was obviously effective.

48
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:52,100
<1-24,Sheldon>里奥纳德长大后现在是一位实验物理学家
<1-24,Sheldon>Leonard grew up to be an experimental physicist.

49
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,750
<1-24,Sheldon>也许如果她还不让他过圣诞节
<1-24,Sheldon>Perhaps if she'd also denied him christmas,

50
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,290
<1-24,Sheldon>他还会更出色些
<1-24,Sheldon>he'd be a little better at it.

51
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:57,820
<1-25,Leonard>谢谢
<1-25,Leonard>Thank you.

52
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,970
<1-26,Howard>我很爱过生日
<1-26,Howard>Well, I love birthdays.

53
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:02,870
<1-26,Howard>起床后早饭是妈妈特制的法式吐司
<1-26,Howard>Waking up to mom's special french toast breakfast,

54
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,500
<1-26,Howard>戴上生日王冠
<1-26,Howard>Wearing the birthday king crown,

55
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,500
<1-26,Howard>和朋友们玩激光枪捉人
<1-26,Howard>playing laser tag with all my friends...

56
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,370
<1-27,Penny>是吗  看见不?
<1-27,Penny>Yeah, see?

57
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:08,790
<1-27,Penny>那才是孩子们该干的
<1-27,Penny>That's what kids should have.

58
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:10,680
<1-28,Howard>事实上  这是在去年
<1-28,Howard>Actually, that was last year.

59
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,720
<1-29,Penny>这么说你真的从来没开过生日派对?
<1-29,Penny>So you really never had a birthday party?

60
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,400
<1-30,Leonard>没错  但没问题啊
<1-30,Leonard>No, but it was okay.

61
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,450
<1-30,Leonard>我小时候
<1-30,Leonard>I mean, when I was little,

62
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:21,960
<1-30,Leonard>还想父母可能会改变主意
<1-30,Leonard>I'd think maybe my parents would change

63
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,470
<1-30,Leonard>然后办个派对给我个惊喜
<1-30,Leonard>Their mind and surprise me with a party.

64
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:26,000
<1-30,Leonard>有一次生日  我上完大提琴课回来
<1-30,Leonard>Like this one birthday I came home from my cello

65
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,810
<1-30,Leonard>看见外面停着许多陌生的轿车
<1-30,Leonard>Lesson and I saw a lot of strange cars parked out front.

66
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:29,570
<1-30,Leonard>我走到门外时
<1-30,Leonard>When I got to the door,

67
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:30,770
<1-30,Leonard>听得见里面人在细声细语
<1-30,Leonard>I could hear people whispering

68
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,770
<1-30,Leonard>还闻到了表兄的巧克力蛋糕
<1-30,Leonard>and I could smell german chocolate cake,

69
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:34,260
<1-30,Leonard>那是我的最爱
<1-30,Leonard>Which is my favorite.

70
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:36,180
<1-31,Penny>然后呢?
<1-31,Penny>And?

71
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,500
<1-32,Leonard>结果是我祖父去世了
<1-32,Leonard>It turns out my grandfather had died.

72
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:42,240
<1-33,Penny>天呐  那太糟糕了
<1-33,Penny>Oh, my god. that's terrible.

73
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,490
<1-34,Leonard>那次倒有点生日派对的意思
<1-34,Leonard>Well, it was kind of like a birthday party.

74
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,440
<1-34,Leonard>所有的亲戚都来了  也有蛋糕  所以...
<1-34,Leonard>I got to see all my cousins, and there was cake, so...

75
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,430
<1-35,Penny>这是我听过的最可怜的事了
<1-35,Penny>That's the saddest thing I've ever heard.

76
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,430
<1-35,Penny>是吗?
<1-35,Penny>You think?

77
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:55,100
<1-36,Howard>继续  告诉她你高中毕业舞会的事
<1-36,Howard>Go ahead, tell her about your senior prom.

82
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,880
<1-36,Howard>天才也性感 第一季 第16集
<1-36,Howard>The Big Bang Theory S01E16

83
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:24,210
<2-1,Howard (voice from inside)>叫他们千万别忘了...不放花生
<2-1,Howard (voice from inside)>Make sure they remember-- no peanuts.

84
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:26,200
<2-2,Leonard>霍华德  城里每家泰国餐馆
<2-2,Leonard>Howard, every thai restaurant in town

85
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,570
<2-2,Leonard>都知道你不能吃花生
<2-2,Leonard>knows you can't eat peanuts.

86
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,610
<2-2,Leonard>他们看到我进去都直接说  "不放花生男来了!"
<2-2,Leonard>When they see me coming, they go, "ah, no-peanut boy!"

87
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,280
<2-3,Sheldon (answering)>好  潘妮
<2-3,Sheldon (answering)>Hello, penny.

88
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,390
<2-3,Sheldon (answering)>里奥纳德刚走
<2-3,Sheldon (answering)>Leonard just left.

89
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,960
<2-4,Penny>我知道  我来跟你说呢
<2-4,Penny>I know. I want to talk to you.

90
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,490
<2-5,Sheldon>我们可以说什么?
<2-5,Sheldon>What would we talk about?

91
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,390
<2-5,Sheldon>就我所知我们没有什么共同语言
<2-5,Sheldon>We have no overlapping areas of interest I'm aware of.

92
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,200
<2-5,Sheldon>你知道  我对闲谈没兴趣
<2-5,Sheldon>As you know, I don't care for chitchat.

93
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:54,900
<2-6,Penny>你先让我进去好吗
<2-6,Penny>Can you just let me in?

94
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,490
<2-7,Sheldon>没问题  但我不认为这是什么有效的努力
<2-7,Sheldon>Well, all right, but I don't see this as a promising endeavor.

95
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,420
<2-8,Penny>好  直接说吧
<2-8,Penny>Okay, here's the deal.

96
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,930
<2-8,Penny>我们要在周六给里奥纳德
<2-8,Penny>We are going to throw leonard a kick-ass

97
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:03,610
<2-8,Penny>办个超级惊喜的生日派对
<2-8,Penny>Surprise party for his birthday on saturday.

98
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:04,870
<2-9,Sheldon>我不赞同
<2-9,Sheldon>I hardly think so.

99
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,060
<2-9,Sheldon>里奥纳德说得很清楚他不想要派对
<2-9,Sheldon>Leonard made it very clear he doesn't want a party.

100
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:09,270
<2-10,Howard>有人说..."派对"?
<2-10,Howard>Did someone say... "party"?

101
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:13,950
<2-11,Penny>他根本不知道他想要  因为他从来没有过
<2-11,Penny>He just doesn't know he wants one 'cause he's never had one.

102
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,080
<2-12,Howard>这倒是可能的  但申明一下
<2-12,Howard>I suppose that's possible, but for the record,

103
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,610
<2-12,Howard>我从来没玩过3P  但我仍知道我想玩
<2-12,Howard>I've never had a threesome and yet I still know I want one.

104
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:22,150
<2-12,Howard>霍华德
<2-12,Howard>Howard,

105
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:24,140
<2-13,Penny>区别在这儿...里奥纳德享受一次生日派对
<2-13,Penny>Here's the difference-- the possibility exists that

106
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:27,190
<2-13,Penny>还有可能在地狱毁灭之前发生
<2-13,Penny>Leonard could have a birthday party before hell freezes over.

107
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,230
<2-14,Howard>好吧  如果我真的玩3P了  我不会叫你的
<2-14,Howard>Fine. if I do have a threesome, you can't be part of it.

108
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,540
<2-14,Howard>我开个玩笑啦  你可以加入的
<2-14,Howard>I'm just kidding. yes, you can.

109
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:40,330
<2-14,Howard>你可以带个朋友来吗
<2-14,Howard>Can you bring a friend.

110
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:43,330
<2-15,Sheldon>生日派对真是个馊主意
<2-15,Sheldon>I think a birthday party's a terrible idea.

111
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:46,200
<2-15,Sheldon>我真嫉妒里奥纳德从小到大能免于这份痛苦
<2-15,Sheldon>I envy leonard for growing up without that anguish.

112
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,040
<2-16,Penny>痛苦?!
<2-16,Penny>Anguish?!

113
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,470
<2-17,Sheldon>年复一年
<2-17,Sheldon>Year after year,

114
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:51,400
<2-17,Sheldon>我都得忍受戴滑稽帽子的痛苦
<2-17,Sheldon>I had to endure wearing comical hats while being

115
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,180
<2-17,Sheldon>然后被迫走到那又挤又满是汗臭的快乐城堡里
<2-17,Sheldon>Forced into the crowded, sweaty hell of bouncy castles.

116
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,090
<2-17,Sheldon>更别提要把我眼睛遮住  转几圈走到一个奇怪的熊那里
<2-17,Sheldon>Not to mention being blindfolded and being spun toward a

117
00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:00,770
<2-17,Sheldon>被其他小孩子嘲笑我没有方向感
<2-17,Sheldon>Grotesque illess donkey as the other children mocked my disorientation.

118
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,060
<2-18,Penny>亲爱的
<2-18,Penny>Okay, sweetie,

119
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:07,320
<2-18,Penny>我知道你有一些非专业人士无法治愈的伤疤
<2-18,Penny>I understand u have scars that no nonprofeioional can heal, but,

120
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,330
<2-18,Penny>但是无论如何  我们都要给里奥纳德开个生日派对
<2-18,Penny>Nevertheless, we're going to throw leonard a birthday party.

121
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:11,940
<2-19,Sheldon>我有没有说清楚我特别不喜欢跳舞
<2-19,Sheldon>Have I pointed out that I'm extremely uncomforblble with dancing,

122
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,990
<2-19,Sheldon>很吵的音乐  和其他大多由酒精引起的无聊举动?
<2-19,Sheldon>Loud music and most other forms of alcohol-induced frivolity?

123
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:18,110
<2-20,Penny>无论如何  我们...
<2-20,Penny>Nevertheless, we're...

124
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,820
<2-21,Sheldon>另外  我真觉得里奥纳德并不想...
<2-21,Sheldon>In addition, I really don't think that leonard wtsts...

125
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,310
<2-22,Penny>要么你帮我开派对  要么  上帝啊
<2-22,Penny>You either you help me throw leonard a birtayay party or, so help me god,

126
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:24,640
<2-22,Penny>我会到你的卧室里把你最值钱的
<2-22,Penny>I will go into your bedroom and unbag all of your most valuable,

127
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,860
<2-22,Penny>全新漫画书都倒出来
<2-22,Penny>Mint-condition comic books.

128
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,330
<2-22,Penny>然后在其中一本...你不会知道是哪本
<2-22,Penny>And on one of them-- you won't know which--

129
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:30,050
<2-22,Penny>-我会在上面用墨水画一个小小的笑脸  -你不能这么做
<2-22,Penny>I'll draw a tiny happy face in ink. you can't do that.

130
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:35,730
<2-23,Sheldon>如果你在一本全新的漫画书上做标记  那就不是全新的了
<2-23,Sheldon>If you make a mark in a mint comic book, it's no longer mint.

131
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,820
<2-24,Penny>谢尔顿  你懂啥叫勒索吗?
<2-24,Penny>Sheldon, do you understand the concept of blackmail?

132
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,150
<2-25,Sheldon>当然  我明白  噢...
<2-25,Sheldon>Well, of course, i... oh.

133
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,020
<2-25,Sheldon>我有个想法
<2-25,Sheldon>Yeah, I have an idea.

134
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,650
<2-25,Sheldon>我们来给里奥纳德开一个超级生日派对吧
<2-25,Sheldon>Let's throw leonard a kick-ass birthday party.

135
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,470
<3-1,Sheldon>这不是敲门密码
<3-1,Sheldon>That's not the secret knock.

136
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,710
<3-1,Sheldon>这才是敲门密码
<3-1,Sheldon>This is the secret knock.

137
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,240
<3-2,Howard>有什么区别啊?
<3-2,Howard>what difference does it make?

138
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,430
<3-3,Sheldon>设置敲门密码的所有意义就在于建立一种
<3-3,Sheldon>The whole point of a secret knock is to establish a

139
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:22,310
<3-3,Sheldon>非语言信号来验证某人的同行者身份的办法
<3-3,Sheldon>Non-verbal signal to verify the identity of one's co-conspirators.

140
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:23,770
<3-4,Penny>是不是拉杰和霍华德?
<3-4,Penny>Is that raj and howard?

141
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:25,470
<3-5,Sheldon>可能  但是还没有核对
<3-5,Sheldon>Possibly, but unverified.

142
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,730
<3-6,Howard>让我们进去不
<3-6,Howard>Will you just let us in.

143
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:30,220
<3-7,Sheldon>你很幸运  这并不是核反应堆
<3-7,Sheldon>Luckily for you, this is not a nuclear reactor.

144
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,810
<3-8,Penny>你们准备了什么生日礼物?
<3-8,Penny>So what'd you get the birthday boy?

145
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:34,620
<3-9,Howard>拉杰给他买了一个特别赞的
<3-9,Howard>Well, raj got him an awesome,

146
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,510
<3-9,Howard>限量版黑暗武士的雕塑
<3-9,Howard>Limited edition dark knight sculpture

147
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:38,020
<3-9,Howard>是出自阿列克斯·罗丝版本授权的蝙蝠侠
<3-9,Howard>Based on alex ross's definitive batman.

148
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,880
<3-9,Howard>而我送给他这份完美的  有费曼亲笔签名的
<3-9,Howard>And I got him this amazing autographed copy

149
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,750
<3-9,Howard>关于物理学演讲的拷贝
<3-9,Howard>Of the feynman lectures on physics.

150
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:43,350
<3-10,Penny>太棒了
<3-10,Penny>Nice.

151
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:44,760
<3-10,Penny>我要送他一件毛衣
<3-10,Penny>I got him a sweater.

152
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,810
<3-11,Howard>他可能会喜欢吧
<3-11,Howard>Okay, well, he might like that.

153
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:49,430
<3-11,Howard>我见过他感到冷的
<3-11,Howard>I've seen him get chilly.

154
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,400
<3-12,Penny>谢尔顿  我没有看到你的礼物啊
<3-12,Penny>Sheldon, I didn't see your present.

155
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,090
<3-13,Sheldon>因为我没有带礼物来
<3-13,Sheldon>That's because I didn't bring one.

156
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,270
<3-15,Howard>-为什么啊?  -别问
<3-15,Howard>Why not? don't ask.

157
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:58,720
<3-16,Sheldon>整个送礼物的机制是没有意义的
<3-16,Sheldon>The entire institution of gift-giving makes no sense.

158
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,160
<3-17,Howard>-太迟了  -比如说我花50美元给你买礼物
<3-17,Howard>Too late. let's say I go out and I spend $50 on you.

159
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,560
<3-18,Sheldon>我得费尽心思想你需要什么  这是件很艰苦的事情
<3-18,Sheldon>It's a laborious activity because I have to imagine what you need,

160
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,940
<3-18,Sheldon>而且你知道你需要什么
<3-18,Sheldon>Whereas you know what you need.

161
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:10,280
<3-18,Sheldon>现在  我们把事情简化  直接给你50美元
<3-18,Sheldon>Now, I could simplify things-- just give you the $50 directly,

162
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,450
<3-18,Sheldon>然后我生日的时候你给我50美元  这样继续下去
<3-18,Sheldon>And then you could give me $50 on my birthday, and so on,

163
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:16,910
<3-18,Sheldon>直到我们其中一个死了  留下个比你富50美元的老人
<3-18,Sheldon>Until one of us dies, leaving the other one old and $50 richer.

164
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,130
<3-18,Sheldon>我问问你  这样有意义吗
<3-18,Sheldon>And I ask you, is it worth it?

165
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,980
<3-19,Howard>叫你别问的
<3-19,Howard>Told you not to ask.

166
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:26,440
<3-20,Penny>谢尔顿  你是他朋友啊
<3-20,Penny>Well, sheldon, you're his friend.

167
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,270
<3-20,Penny>朋友之间就是互送礼物的
<3-20,Penny>Friends give each other presents.

168
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,900
<3-21,Sheldon>我同意你的论据  但不同意你的论点
<3-21,Sheldon>I accept your premise; I reject your conclusion.

169
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:36,810
<3-22,Howard>你试试告诉他这是一个没得选择的社交习俗
<3-22,Howard>Try telling him it's a non-optional social convention.

170
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:37,610
<3-23,Penny>什么?
<3-23,Penny>What?

171
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:38,730
<3-24,Howard>照我说的做
<3-24,Howard>Just do it.

172
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,290
<3-25,Penny>这是一个没得选择的...
<3-25,Penny>It's a non-optional...

173
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:45,130
<3-25,Penny>社交习俗
<3-25,Penny>Social convention.

174
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,310
<3-26,Sheldon>那倒是
<3-26,Sheldon>Oh. fair enough.

175
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,550
<3-27,Howard>他很有规则性的
<3-27,Howard>He came with a manual.

176
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,020
<3-28,Sheldon>提问  我怎么在派对之前
<3-28,Sheldon>Question-- how am I going to get leonard

177
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:56,890
<3-28,Sheldon>给里奥纳德准备一份礼物?
<3-28,Sheldon>a present before the party?

178
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,930
<3-28,Sheldon>我不会开车而且在步行范围内
<3-28,Sheldon>I don't drive and the only things available within

179
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:01,070
<3-28,Sheldon>能去的只有一家泰国菜餐馆和一个加油站
<3-28,Sheldon>Walking distance are a thai restaurant and a gas station.

180
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:03,360
<3-28,Sheldon>我看我能打包一份
<3-28,Sheldon>I suppose I could wrap up an order of

181
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,510
<3-28,Sheldon>脆炸米粉再加一些刮奖券
<3-28,Sheldon>Mee krob and a couple of lottery scratchers.

182
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:10,060
<3-29,Penny>我们这么办  我开车带谢尔顿去买礼物
<3-29,Penny>Okay let's do this-- I will drive sheldon to get a present.

183
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,940
<3-29,Penny>霍华德  你得让里奥纳德离开房间两小时
<3-29,Penny>And howard, you need to get rid of leonard for about two hours.

184
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:12,560
<3-30,Howard>没问题
<3-30,Howard>No problem.

185
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,890
<3-31,Penny>然后拉杰  你把东西搬到对面
<3-31,Penny>And then, raj, you bring the stuff

186
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,590
<3-31,Penny>然后开始布置
<3-31,Penny>across the hall and start setting up.

187
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,990
<3-32,Howard (after Raj whispers in his ear)>如果有客人来了怎么办?
<3-32,Howard (after Raj whispers in his ear)>What if guests show up?

188
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:20,290
<3-33,Penny>招待他们
<3-33,Penny>Entertain them.

189
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,230
<3-34,Howard>要是是女客人怎么办?
<3-34,Howard>What if they're women?

190
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,940
<3-35,Penny>一直盯着她们  让她们觉得不舒服
<3-35,Penny>Stare at them and make them feel uncomfortable.

191
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:40,010
<4-3,Howard>你还好吗
<4-3,Howard>How's it goin'?

192
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:41,000
<4-4,Leonard>很好
<4-4,Leonard>Fine.

193
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:45,860
<4-5,Howard>听着  新艺术影院正在放映
<4-5,Howard>So listen, the nuart is showing the revised,

194
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,860
<4-5,Howard>最终修订版的银翼杀手
<4-5,Howard>Definitive cut of blade runner.

195
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,810
<4-6,Leonard>看过了
<4-6,Leonard>Seen it.

196
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:52,080
<4-7,Howard>不  你看的是25周年的最终版本
<4-7,Howard>No, you've seen the 25th anniversary final cut.

197
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,780
<4-7,Howard>而这个版本有八秒钟以前没看过的片断
<4-7,Howard>This one has eight seconds of previously unseen footage.

198
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,810
<4-7,Howard>他们说这会完全改变电影的基调
<4-7,Howard>They say it completely changes the tone of the film.

199
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,130
<4-8,Leonard>算了
<4-8,Leonard>Uh... pass.

200
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,470
<4-8,Leonard>来吧
<4-8,Leonard>Come on.

201
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:04,750
<4-9,Howard>之后还有与哈里斯·福特替身的问答
<4-9,Howard>Afterwards, there's a q & a with harrison ford's body double.

202
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:08,240
<4-10,Leonard>听着  我正在打光晕生命之战呢
<4-10,Leonard>Look, I'm in the halo battle of my life here.

203
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,720
<4-10,Leonard>这是个在哥本哈根的小孩  他没有免疫系统
<4-10,Leonard>There's this kid in copenhagen-- he has no immune system,

204
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,660
<4-10,Leonard>所以他24小时加7天不停地坐着打光晕
<4-10,Leonard>So all he does is sit in his bubble and play halo 24-seven.

205
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:16,360
<4-11,Howard>你不能找别的时间跟他玩?
<4-11,Howard>Can't you play him some other time?

206
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,400
<4-12,Leonard>如果你相信他的医生那就不能
<4-12,Leonard>Not if you believe his doctors.

207
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,880
<4-13,Howard>天啊  闻到煤气味吗
<4-13,Howard>Oh, my god, do you smell gas?

208
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:25,900
<4-14,Leonard>没有
<4-14,Leonard>No.

209
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:26,650
<4-15,Howard>确实没有
<4-15,Howard>Yeah, no.

210
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:34,140
<5-1,Penny>那边有DVD播放机
<5-1,Penny>You know, they have dvds over there.

211
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,430
<5-2,Sheldon>是  但这里有DVD刻录机
<5-2,Sheldon>Yes, but they have dvd burners over here.

212
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:40,400
<5-2,Sheldon>里奥纳德需要一个DVD刻录机
<5-2,Sheldon>leonard needs a dvd burner.

213
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,780
<5-3,Penny>谢尔顿  礼物不应该是一个人所需要的
<5-3,Penny>Sheldon, a gift shouldn't be something someone needs,

214
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,040
<5-3,Penny>而应该是一件有趣的东西
<5-3,Penny>It should be something fun.

215
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,870
<5-3,Penny>一件他们不会买给自己的东西
<5-3,Penny>You know, something they wouldn't buy for themself.

216
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:49,010
<5-4,Sheldon>你意思说比如一件毛衣?
<5-4,Sheldon>You mean like a sweater?

217
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,780
<5-5,Penny>那件毛衣很有趣的
<5-5,Penny>It's a fun sweater.

218
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:56,030
<5-5,Penny>上面有一个醒目的几何图案
<5-5,Penny>It's got a bold geometric print.

219
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:58,900
<5-6,Sheldon>-是几何学使它变得有趣?  -好吧...
<5-6,Sheldon>Is it the geometry that makes it fun? okay...

220
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:02,520
<5-7,Penny>重点是我们关心某个人的表达方式之一
<5-7,Penny>The point is one of the ways we show we care about people is

221
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,620
<5-7,Penny>可以是通过把想法和想象力赋予到送他的礼物中
<5-7,Penny>By putting thought and imagination into the gifts we give them.

222
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,830
<5-8,Sheldon>我明白了
<5-8,Sheldon>Okay, I see.

223
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:10,690
<5-8,Sheldon>-所以不能是DVD刻录机了  -没错
<5-8,Sheldon>So, not a dvd burner exactly.

224
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:12,270
<5-10,Sheldon>一件他不会买给自己的东西
<5-10,Sheldon>Something he wouldn't buy for himself.

225
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:14,530
<5-10,Sheldon>一件有趣的东西  一件像...
<5-10,Sheldon>Something fun. something like...

226
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,870
<5-10,Sheldon>802-11n无线路由器
<5-10,Sheldon>An 802-11n wireless router!

227
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:22,890
<6-1,Leonard>来吧  哥本哈根男孩
<6-1,Leonard>Here you go, copenhagen boy.

<6-1,Leonard>尝尝汉斯·克里斯蒂安手雷的滋味吧
<6-1,Leonard>How about a taste of hans christian hand grenade?

229
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,880
<6-1,Leonard>那肯定感觉不好
<6-1,Leonard>Oh, that could not feel good.

230
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:34,850
<6-1,Leonard>来啊  来...
<6-1,Leonard>Come on, come...

231

<6-1,Leonard>来啊  来啊
<6-1,Leonard>Come on. come on.

233
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,000
<6-1,Leonard>尝尝这个!
<6-1,Leonard>Take that!

234
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,070
<6-3,Leonard>怎么了?
<6-3,Leonard>What's the matter?

235
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:53,830
<6-4,Howard>这个格兰诺拉燕麦卷里面有花生!
