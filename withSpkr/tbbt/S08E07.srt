1
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:05,510
<1-1,Bernadette>最近在研究什么呢
<1-1,Bernadette>So, what are you working on these days?

2
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:07,450
<1-2,Amy>我在研究单细胞生物
<1-2,Amy>I'm studying one-celled organisms

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:09,060
<1-2,Amy>试图从它们身上找到
<1-2,Amy>to try and find the neurochemicals

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,060
<1-2,Amy>引发羞愧感的神经化学物质
<1-2,Amy>that lead to the feeling of shame.

5
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:13,870
<1-3,Bernadette>单细胞生物会有什么需要感到羞耻的事啊
<1-3,Bernadette>What would a one-celled organism have to be embarrassed about?

6
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:17,260
<1-4,Penny>跟人类一样  车震完没穿内衣裤下车
<1-4,Penny>Same as all of us, getting out of a car without underwear.

7
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:19,950
<1-5,Bermadette>说到内衣
<1-5,Bermadette>Speaking of underwear,

8
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:21,680
<1-5,Bermadette>我有件挺有意思的事
<1-5,Bermadette>I have some interesting news...

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,730
<1-6,Penny>如果是华仔偶尔会穿你的内衣
<1-6,Penny>Okay, if it's sometimes Howie wears yours,

10
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:25,840
<1-6,Penny>那莱纳德已经告诉过我们了
<1-6,Penny>Leonard already told us.

11
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:28,990
<1-7,Bernadette>他只是在搞笑
<1-7,Bernadette>He was being funny.

12
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,650
<1-7,Bernadette>我挺确定
<1-7,Bernadette>I'm pretty sure.

13
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,660
<1-7,Bernadette>总之  我受邀参与一篇关于加州
<1-7,Bernadette>Anyway, I was asked to be a part of a magazine article

14
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,890
<1-7,Bernadette>最性感的50名女性科学家的杂志专题
<1-7,Bernadette>about the 50 sexiest female scientists in California.

15
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:40,160
<1-7,Bernadette>挺酷的吧
<1-7,Bernadette>Isn't that cool?

16
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,570
<1-8,Amy>我觉得很恶心
<1-8,Amy>I think it's awful.

17
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:42,990
<1-9,Penny>你怎么会这么说
<1-9,Penny>Why would you say that?

18
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:45,920
<1-10,Amy>伯纳黛特是一位成功的微生物学家
<1-10,Amy>Bernadette is a successful microbiologist.

19
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,580
<1-10,Amy>人们应该赞美她的科研成果  而非长相
<1-10,Amy>She should be celebrated for her achievements, not her looks.

20
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:50,570
<1-10,Amy>参与这种杂志专题  人们会怎么想
<1-10,Amy>I mean, what kind of message does that send?

21
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:54,230
<1-11,Penny>人们大概会想  "快看这童颜科学家的巨乳"
<1-11,Penny>I think the message is-- "Check out the rack on that scientist."

22
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:59,550
<1-12,Bernadette>为什么就不能被认为是智慧与美貌并存的呢
<1-12,Bernadette>Why can't someone be thought of as both smart and pretty?

23
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,760
<1-13,Amy>我只是不觉得一位职场女性需要靠
<1-13,Amy>I just don't think a professional woman should have

24
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,510
<1-13,Amy>展现自己女性象征来获得成功
<1-13,Amy>to flaunt her sexuality in order to get ahead.

25
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:05,630
<1-14,Penny>这有什么大不了的啊
<1-14,Penny>Okay, what's the big deal?

26
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:07,290
<1-14,Penny>如果那能帮我多卖点药给医生
<1-14,Penny>Look, if it helps me make a sale with a physician,

27
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,070
<1-14,Penny>我觉得跟人家调情一下也无妨
<1-14,Penny>I don't think it hurts to flirt a little.

28
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:11,880
<1-14,Penny>比如他说笑话就笑一笑  碰碰他们的手臂
<1-14,Penny>I mean, laugh at their joke, touch their arm,

29
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,100
<1-14,Penny>下车前冷气开超强  激凸一下
<1-14,Penny>maybe crank up the AC in the car beforehand, you know,

30
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,190
<1-14,Penny>见医生管用
<1-14,Penny>to wake up the girls.

31
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:20,000
<1-15,Amy>可能在销售业界里有不同之处
<1-15,Amy>Maybe it's different in the world of sales,

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
<1-15,Amy>但在科学界  女性本来就已经
<1-15,Amy>but it's already hard enough for women

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,620
<1-15,Amy>很难被人认真公平对待了
<1-15,Amy>to be taken seriously in science.

34
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:26,320
<1-16,Bernadette>我本来还对参与文章这事挺激动
<1-16,Bernadette>I was kind of excited about the article,

35
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,960
<1-16,Bernadette>现在被你说得好难过
<1-16,Bernadette>but now you're making me feel bad.

36
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,040
<1-17,Penny>我觉得你想做什么就去做
<1-17,Penny>No, I think you should do whatever you want.

37
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,940
<1-17,Penny>当年如果有时尚杂志刊载女性科学家照片
<1-17,Penny>You know, maybe if fashion magazines had female scientists in them,

38
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:35,930
<1-17,Penny>说不定我也去当理论物理学家了
<1-17,Penny>I would've become a theoretical physicist.

39
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:39,830
<1-17,Penny>少在那边互相偷笑了
<1-17,Penny>Stop smirking at each other.

46
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:15,020
<2-1,Man with Flowers>多谢
<2-1,Man with Flowers>Thank you.

47
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:17,240
<2-1,Man with Flowers>是我该谢你
<2-1,Man with Flowers>No, thank you.

48
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,140
<2-2,Sheldon>送货员是我们国家贸易界的
<2-2,Sheldon>Delivery men are the unsung foot soldiers

49
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,020
<2-2,Sheldon>无名英雄
<2-2,Sheldon>of our nation's commerce.

50
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,230
<2-2,Sheldon>因为有你这样的人
<2-2,Sheldon>It's because of people like you,

51
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:27,600
<2-2,Sheldon>像我这样的人才可以尽少接触人
<2-2,Sheldon>people like me can limit our human contact.

52
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:31,840
<2-2,Sheldon>我很想与你握手  但你懂的...
<2-2,Sheldon>I'd shake your hand, but, well, you know.

53
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,180
<2-3,Man>我不是送货员  我是名医生
<2-3,Man>I'm not a delivery man, I-I'm a doctor.

54
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,920
<2-3,Man>虽然我也常常
<2-3,Man>Although I do often deliver

55
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,600
<2-3,Man>亲自给病人送结果很不妙的活检报告
<2-3,Man>alarming biopsy results to my patients.

56
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:43,840
<2-4,Sheldon>你真幽默
<2-4,Sheldon>That's humorous.

57
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:46,700
<2-5,Man>呵呵
<2-5,Man>All right.

58
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:52,320
<2-6,Sheldon>我猜你一定常让病人满身缝补[捧腹大笑]
<2-6,Sheldon>Yeah, I-I bet you leave your patients in stitches.

59
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:57,050
<2-6,Sheldon>我这也是幽默
<2-6,Sheldon>That was also humorous.

60
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:59,890
<2-7,Man>呵呵
<2-7,Man>All right.

61
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:04,070
<2-8,Sheldon>你手里拿着花
<2-8,Sheldon>Are you bringing flowers to a patient

62
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:07,290
<2-8,Sheldon>是为了安慰得了不治之症的病人吗
<2-8,Sheldon>to cushion the blow of a terminal diagnosis?

63
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,770
<2-8,Sheldon>刚才不是笑话
<2-8,Sheldon>That wasn't a joke.

64
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:16,850
<2-8,Sheldon>呵呵
<2-8,Sheldon>All right.

65
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:20,280
<2-9,Man>这花是要送给一位
<2-9,Man>These are actually for a nice woman

66
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,400
<2-9,Man>打来我办公室推销的好姑娘
<2-9,Man>who makes sales calls to my office.

67
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,010
<2-10,Sheldon>你知道有送货员可以代劳这种事吗
<2-10,Sheldon>You know, they have delivery people that will do that for you.

68
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,580
<2-11,Man>我是想靠着
<2-11,Man>I was hoping to impress her

69
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,190
<2-11,Man>网上人肉她搜到的资料
<2-11,Man>by tracking her down on the Internet

70
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:35,180
<2-11,Man>直接来到她家门口给她一个惊喜
<2-11,Man>and then showing up unannounced at her door.

71
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:38,850
<2-12,Sheldon>付出额外的努力
<2-12,Sheldon>Making the extra effort.

72
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,370
<2-12,Sheldon>给你按个赞
<2-12,Sheldon>Good for you.

73
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,330
<2-13,Leonard>时间刚刚好  晚餐刚刚到
<2-13,Leonard>Great timing, food just got here.

74
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:53,060
<2-14,Sheldon>-泰国菜吗  -是的
<2-14,Sheldon>- Ooh, Siam Palace? - Yes.

75
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,850
<2-16,Sheldon>-泰式炒面与鸡肉沙爹  -有的
<2-16,Sheldon>- Uh, mee krob and chicken satay? - Yes.

76
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:57,330
<2-17,Leonard>-多加花生酱了吗  -没  我的给你好了
<2-17,Leonard>- Uh, extra peanut sauce? - No, but you can have mine.

77
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:58,990
<2-18,Sheldon>好吧  也行
<2-18,Sheldon>Eh, well, very well.

78
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:03,250
<2-20,Sheldon>既然说到了分享你的东西
<2-20,Sheldon>Oh, and on the topic of sharing things that are yours,

79
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,340
<2-20,Sheldon>有个穿着绅士的访客
<2-20,Sheldon>there is a gentleman caller

80
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,700
<2-20,Sheldon>就在我们说话的这会  带着花找你未婚妻
<2-20,Sheldon>bringing flowers to your fiancee as we speak.

81
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,130
<2-20,Sheldon>什么
<2-20,Sheldon>What?

82
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:13,480
<2-21,Leonard>你怎么不一进门就说呢
<2-21,Leonard>Why didn't you say that first?

83
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,380
<2-22,Sheldon>那你为什么没多加花生酱呢
<2-22,Sheldon>Why didn't you get extra peanut sauce?

84
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,210
<2-22,Sheldon>要斗嘴谁怕谁
<2-22,Sheldon>We can both play this game.

85
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:21,030
<2-23,Leonard>请问你有事吗
<2-23,Leonard>Can I help you?

86
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:22,230
<2-24,Man>你好
<2-24,Man>Oh, hi.

87
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:24,040
<2-24,Man>请问佩妮住这里吗
<2-24,Man>Uh, does Penny live here?

88
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,280
<2-25,Leonard>我能问为什么找她吗
<2-25,Leonard>May I ask why?

89
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:30,900
<2-26,Man>我是在我办公室认识她的  她对我抛媚眼
<2-26,Man>I-I met her at my office, she winked at me.

90
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:37,760
<2-26,Man>我来是希望跟她继续发展
<2-26,Man>I-I came hoping to initiate a romantic relationship.

91
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,800
<2-27,Leonard>我敢确定她没对你抛媚眼
<2-27,Leonard>Look, I'm pretty sure she didn't wink at you.

92
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,200
<2-28,Man>她绝对有
<2-28,Man>Oh, she did.

93
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,770
<2-28,Man>动作很勾人  像这样
<2-28,Man>Seductively, like this.

94
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,490
<2-28,Man>然后她摸了我的手臂足足两大秒
<2-28,Man>And then she touched my arm for two Mississippis.

95
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,570
<2-28,Man>像这样  一大秒  两...
<2-28,Man>Like, you know, one Mississippi, two...

96
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:58,280
<2-29,Leonard>我懂了  我懂了
<2-29,Leonard>I got it, I got it.

97
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:01,710
<2-29,Leonard>听我说
<2-29,Leonard>Listen, um...

98
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:04,350
<2-29,Leonard>我想这中间一定是有什么误会
<2-29,Leonard>I think there's been a misunderstanding.

99
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:07,060
<2-29,Leonard>佩妮是我的未婚妻
<2-29,Leonard>See, Penny is my fiancee.

100
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,790
<2-31,Raj>真的吗
<2-31,Raj>Really?

101
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:13,620
<2-30,Man>我从未看见她手上有戴订婚戒啊
<2-30,Man>I've never seen her wear an engagement ring.

102
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,580
<2-31,Raj>真的吗
<2-31,Raj>Really?

103
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,940
<2-32,Man>所以我可以推测
<2-32,Man>So, am I to presume

104
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:24,890
<2-32,Man>她挑逗我只是销售技巧的一种罢了
<2-32,Man>that her flirtation was just a sales technique?

105
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:26,370
<2-33,Leonard>应该是
<2-33,Leonard>I think so.

106
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,890
<2-34,Man>我什么时候才学精啊
<2-34,Man>When will I learn?

107
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:33,570
<2-34,Man>宠物店可爱女店员事件又重演了
<2-34,Man>It's just like the cute girl at the pet store all over again.

108
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:35,700
<2-35,Leonard>你说什么
<2-35,Leonard>Excuse me?

109
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:39,140
<2-35,Leonard>那个女孩摸了我的胳膊五大秒
<2-35,Leonard>Oh, uh, she touched my arm for five Mississippis,

110
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:42,810
<2-36,Man>我就花了两千美元买了一个鬣蜥的生态箱
<2-36,Man>and I bought a $2,000 iguana habitat.

112
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:48,620
<2-36,Man>不过她一直很忙  总是没时间来我家看
<2-36,Man>Which she was always too busy to come over and see.

113
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:51,980
<2-36,Man>这花你送给佩妮吧
<2-36,Man>You give these to Penny.

114
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,440
<2-36,Man>你是一个幸运的男人
<2-36,Man>You're, you're a lucky man.

115
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,100
<2-36,Man>谢谢
<2-36,Man>Thank you.

116
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,410
<2-37,Leonard>抱歉
<2-37,Leonard>Sorry.

117
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,720
<2-38,Man>这张卡片还是不要给她看了
<2-38,Man>You probably don't want her to see this.

118
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,980
<2-38,Man>里面有点过于"图文并茂"了
<2-38,Man>It's unnecessarily graphic.

119
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,090
<2-39,Sheldon>等等  医生
<2-39,Sheldon>Hold on, Doctor.

120
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:10,900
<2-39,Sheldon>莱纳德  你的社交礼仪呢
<2-39,Sheldon>Leonard, where are your social skills?

121
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,840
<2-39,Sheldon>这位先生显然很难过
<2-39,Sheldon>This man is clearly upset.

122
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,910
<2-39,Sheldon>我们应该邀他进屋喝一杯热饮
<2-39,Sheldon>We should invite him in for a hot beverage.

123
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,280
<2-40,Leonard>可是他想泡佩妮啊
<2-40,Leonard>He tried to score with Penny.

124
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,580
<2-41,Sheldon>这俩以前也是啊  现在不还跟我们一起吃饭吗
<2-41,Sheldon>So have these two, and they're having dinner with us.

125
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,560
<3-1,Amy>今天工作如何
<3-1,Amy>So, how was work today?

126
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,610
<3-2,Bernadette>还行  你一定会很高兴得知
<3-2,Bernadette>It was fine, but you'll be happy to know

127
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:35,960
<3-2,Bernadette>性感科学家这篇文章取消了
<3-2,Bernadette>they pulled the sexy scientists article.

128
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,310
<3-3,Amy>发生什么事了
<3-3,Amy>What happened?

129
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,460
<3-3,Amy>我也不知道
<3-3,Amy>I don't know.

130
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,840
<3-4,Bernadette>杂志社就取消了照片拍摄
<3-4,Bernadette>They just canceled the photo shoot

131
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,060
<3-4,Bernadette>还说他们要重新考虑一下
<3-4,Bernadette>and said they're rethinking it.

132
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,040
<3-5,Amy>真是太遗憾了
<3-5,Amy>Well, I'm really sorry,

133
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,010
<3-5,Amy>但我认为这是一件好事
<3-5,Amy>but I think it's for the best.

134
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,930
<3-5,Amy>你会想人们关注你的科研成就
<3-5,Amy>You want people focusing on your achievements,

135
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:50,610
<3-5,Amy>而不是盯着某本杂志上的你的咪咪
<3-5,Amy>not staring at your breasts in some magazine.

136
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:51,490
<3-5,Amy>大概吧
<3-5,Amy>I guess.

137
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:53,570
<3-6,Bernadette>上杂志也没那么重要
<3-6,Bernadette>It's really not that important.

138
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,530
<3-6,Bernadette>喂  我眼睛在这呢
<3-6,Bernadette>Hey, up here.

139
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,520
<3-7,Amy>抱歉  说到了就忍不住看一下
<3-7,Amy>Sorry, we're... we were talking about them.

140
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:05,880
<3-7,Amy>听着  我本来不打算说的
<3-7,Amy>So, look, I-I wasn't going to say anything,

141
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,340
<3-7,Amy>但既然你对于文章被取消没意见
<3-7,Amy>but since you seem to be okay with the article being canceled,

142
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,140
<3-7,Amy>我要向你坦白件事
<3-7,Amy>I have a little confession.

143
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:12,340
<3-7,Amy>文章取消是因为我
<3-7,Amy>I'm the reason it was pulled.

144
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:14,280
<3-8,Bernadette>什么  怎么回事
<3-8,Bernadette>What? How?

145
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,910
<3-9,Amy>我给杂志社的编辑
<3-9,Amy>I sent the editors of the magazine

146
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:17,970
<3-9,Amy>发了一封严厉斥责的电邮
<3-9,Amy>a pretty scathing e-mail.

147
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,660
<3-10,Bernadette>艾米  你说了什么
<3-10,Bernadette>Amy, what did you say?

148
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,000
<3-11,Amy>我只是简单指出
<3-11,Amy>I simply pointed out

149
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,960
<3-11,Amy>他们绝对不会考虑做一篇关于
<3-11,Amy>that they would never consider doing an article

150
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,240
<3-11,Amy>男性科学家性感指数排名的文章
<3-11,Amy>ranking male scientists on their sexuality,

151
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,280
<3-11,Amy>更不会刊登他们不同程度宽衣解带的照片
<3-11,Amy>let alone showing them in various stages of undress.

152
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,300
<3-12,Bernadette>因为没人会想看奈尔·德葛拉司·泰森
<3-12,Bernadette>Because no one wants to see Neil deGrasse Tyson

154
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,570
<3-12,Bernadette>湿身在一辆保时捷的引擎盖上弯腰撅屁股
<3-12,Bernadette>in a wet T-shirt, bent over the hood of a Porsche.

155
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,110
<3-13,Amy>这没什么两样
<3-13,Amy>Well, it doesn't make a difference,

156
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:39,340
<3-13,Amy>反正杂志社也认为这的确不得体
<3-13,Amy>because they agreed it was in bad taste,

157
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:41,860
<3-13,Amy>现在你也这么认为  所以...
<3-13,Amy>and now you agree, so...

158
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:44,300
<3-13,Amy>艾米成功挽救大局
<3-13,Amy>Amy saves the day.

159
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,210
<3-14,Bernadette>错  事实是你嫉妒我
<3-14,Bernadette>No, what happened was you got jealous,

160
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:50,050
<3-14,Bernadette>所以你夺走了我宣传自己的机会
<3-14,Bernadette>so you took away a chance for me to get some publicity.

161
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:51,730
<3-15,Amy>但那是负面宣传
<3-15,Amy>But it was bad publicity.

162
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:53,940
<3-16,Bernadette>负不负面我说了算  关你屁事
<3-16,Bernadette>That's for me to decide, not you.

163
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,460
<3-17,Amy>我不同意
<3-17,Amy>I disagree.

164
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:59,410
<3-17,Amy>我认为你的所作所为  会影响我们所有女性科学家
<3-17,Amy>As a female scientist, I think what you do affects all of us.

165
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:01,890
<3-18,Bernadette>我认为你不喜欢人们展现性感的一面
<3-18,Bernadette>And I think you don't like people expressing their sexuality

166
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:04,680
<3-18,Bernadette>因为没人会要求你展现
<3-18,Bernadette>because no one wants you to express yours.

167
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:08,050
<3-18,Bernadette>艾米  非常对不起
<3-18,Bernadette>Oh, Amy, I'm so sorry.

168
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:09,690
<3-18,Bernadette>我说的太过分了
<3-18,Bernadette>That was over the line.

169
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:11,890
<3-19,Amy>祝你有个愉快的夜晚
<3-19,Amy>You have a nice night.

170
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:12,970
<3-20,Bernadette>拜托别走
<3-20,Bernadette>Please don't go.

171
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:16,270
<3-20,Bernadette>在我没有恶意攻击你前  错的人一直是你啊
<3-20,Bernadette>Up until my vicious attack, you were the one in the wrong.

172
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,220
<4-1,Sheldon>医生  请喝
<4-1,Sheldon>Here you go, Doctor.

173
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:24,140
<4-1,Sheldon>紅木槿活力茶  加一勺蜂蜜
<4-1,Sheldon>Red Zinger with one teaspoon of honey.

174
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:24,960
<4-1,Sheldon>谢谢
<4-1,Sheldon>Thank you.

175
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,090
<4-2,Man>这《星际迷航》的杯子不错
<4-2,Man>Neat Star Trek mug.

176
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:30,280
<4-2,Man>其实我有一把来自老版电视剧的光枪
<4-2,Man>I actually have one of the phasers from the original TV show.

177
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,570
<4-3,Raj>酷
<4-3,Raj>Oh, cool.

178
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:32,930
<4-4,Howard>你怎么搞到的
<4-4,Howard>How'd you get that?

179
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:36,020
<4-5,Man>简单  吉恩·罗登贝瑞要做结扎手术
<4-5,Man>Oh, easy, Gene Roddenberry needed a vasectomy.

180
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,780
<4-6,Sehldon>等一下
<4-6,Sehldon>Wait a minute.

181
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:41,950
<4-6,Sehldon>你居然切掉了《星际迷航》之父的输精管
<4-6,Sehldon>You've snipped Gene Roddenberry's vas deferens?

182
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:43,870
<4-7,Man>是的
<4-7,Man>Yes.

183
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:47,420
<4-8,Howard>他真是去了"前人未至之境"啊
<4-8,Howard>Wow, he really went where no man has gone before.

184
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:47,420
<4-8,Howard>源自《星际迷航：原初系列》开场导语中的一句短语
<4-8,Howard>Where no man has gone before

185
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,520
<4-9,Man>我不喜欢吹嘘  但你们要知道
<4-9,Man>I don't like to brag, but, uh, you see,

186
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:57,610
<4-9,Man>我是专门帮明星们看尿路的医生
<4-9,Man>I'm kind of the doctor to the stars' urinary tracts.

187
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,660
<4-11,Man>你们想看詹姆斯·卡梅隆的肾结石吗
<4-11,Man>Uh, you, you want to see James Cameron's kidney stone?

188
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,860
<4-11,Man>好莱坞著名导演  因自编自导科幻电影《终结者》成名
<4-11,Man>也是《泰坦尼克号》与《阿凡达》的导演

189
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,010
<4-13,Man>他把石头排出之后超开心
<4-13,Man>He was so happy after he passed it,

190
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:16,650
<4-13,Man>还送了我一个终结者模型
<4-13,Man>he gave me a Terminator.

191
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:18,390
<4-14,Leonard>真是太不可思议了
<4-14,Leonard>That is amazing.

192
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,180
<4-14,Leonard>你从什么时候开始收藏的
<4-14,Leonard>How long have you been collecting?

193
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,480
<4-15,Man>从我小时候就开始了
<4-15,Man>Ever since I was a kid,

194
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,270
<4-15,Man>但之前都是玩票性质的
<4-15,Man>but, uh, I didn't really get serious

196
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:27,660
<4-15,Man>直到威廉·夏特纳膀胱感染  我才开始认真收藏
<4-15,Man>until William Shatner's bladder infection.

197
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,420
<4-16,Sheldon>你又得到什么好处  快说说
<4-16,Sheldon>What'd you get? What'd you get?

198
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,600
<4-17,Man>他说那是《星际迷航》里的毛毛球
<4-17,Man>Well, he said it was a tribble.

199
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,690
<4-17,Man>但其实也可能只是假发
<4-17,Man>It could be a toupee,

200
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:34,750
<4-17,Man>反正不管是哪样  都蛮酷的
<4-17,Man>but either way, it's pretty cool.

201
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,890
<4-18,Raj>我超想去看你的藏品
<4-18,Raj>I-I would love to see your collection.

202
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:40,290
<4-19,Man>随时欢迎
<4-19,Man>Anytime.

203
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:42,050
<4-19,Man>我有一些很酷的收藏
<4-19,Man>Uh, I've got some cool stuff.

204
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:43,070
<4-19,Man>我最初开始收藏时
<4-19,Man>When I first started,

205
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:45,000
<4-19,Man>我以为这会是结识女性的好方法
<4-19,Man>I thought it would be a good way to meet women,

206
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,740
<4-20,Howard>但结果...你们懂的
<4-20,Howard>but, well, you know...

207
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,280
<4-21,Raj>-当然懂  -太懂了
<4-21,Raj>- Sure. - Preach.

208
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:53,890
<4-22,Man>我能问你一个私人问题吗
<4-22,Man>Can I ask you a personal question?

209
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,160
<4-23,Leonard>问吧
<4-23,Leonard>Sure.

210
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:59,700
<4-24,Man>你和我基本上是一类人
<4-24,Man>Um, I mean, you're a guy like me,

211
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,760
<4-24,Man>你是怎么追到佩妮这类的上等妞
<4-24,Man>so how'd you get a girl like Penny?

212
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:06,620
<4-25,Leonard>就是...
<4-25,Leonard>Well, you know, just...

213
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:09,310
<4-25,Leonard>做自己  真的
<4-25,Leonard>being myself, really.

214
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:10,630
<4-25,Leonard>少来
<4-25,Leonard>Oh, please!

215
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:12,330
<4-26,Sheldon>我来告诉他是怎么做到的
<4-26,Sheldon>You know, I'll tell you how he did it.

216
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:15,920
<4-26,Sheldon>绵延不绝  永无休止地纠缠
<4-26,Sheldon>Implacable, relentless badgering.

217
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,970
<4-26,Sheldon>用泌尿学术语来说
<4-26,Sheldon>In urology terms,

218
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:20,910
<4-26,Sheldon>他就像是耐药性葡萄球菌
<4-26,Sheldon>he was a drug-resistant staph infection.

219
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:24,520
<4-26,Sheldon>而她是摆脱不了葡萄球菌感染的尿道
<4-26,Sheldon>And she was a urethra that could not shake him.

220
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,860
<4-27,Leonard>我可不会称自己是一种感染
<4-27,Leonard>I don't know that I'd call myself an infection.

221
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,640
<4-28,Howard>英勇的男人回先为
<4-28,Howard>A gallant man would defend

222
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,620
<4-28,Howard>被称为"尿道"的未婚妻辩护
<4-28,Howard>his fiancee for being called a urethra.

223
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,910
<4-29,Leonard>我们能换个话题吗
<4-29,Leonard>Can we please change the subject?

224
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,490
<4-31,Raj>貌似天不遂人愿啊
<4-31,Raj>Well, that didn't go your way.

225
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:46,470
<4-32,Penny>乐维斯医生  你在这里做什么
<4-32,Penny>Dr. Lorvis, what are you doing here?

226
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:49,020
<4-33,Dr Lorvis>其实我是来找你的
<4-33,Dr Lorvis>Uh, well, actually I came to see you.

227
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,240
<4-34,Penny>是吗  为什么
<4-34,Penny>Really? Why?

228
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:52,690
<4-35,Leonard>这问题问在点子上了
<4-35,Leonard>Ah, that's a good question.

229
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:56,410
<4-35,Leonard>貌似某人没有戴订婚戒
<4-35,Leonard>Apparently someone was being awfully flirty

230
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:58,090
<4-35,Leonard>而且整天跟人眉来眼去
<4-35,Leonard>while not wearing their engagement ring,

231
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,590
<4-35,Leonard>所以招惹了那人来到这里
<4-35,Leonard>causing another someone to show up here

232
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:01,690
<4-35,Leonard>因为他以为某人还单身
<4-35,Leonard>thinking the first someone might be available.

233
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:03,280
<4-36,Sheldon>别说得这么复杂
<4-36,Sheldon>Oh, God. Don't make it so hard on her.

234
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:06,500
<4-36,Sheldon>某人指的是不忠的你
<4-36,Sheldon>Look, the first someone is the deceitful you.

235
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,380
<4-36,Sheldon>那人指的是
<4-36,Sheldon>The second someone

236
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:11,080
<4-36,Sheldon>可爱的乐维斯医生
<4-36,Sheldon>is the delightful Dr. Lorvis.

237
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:13,510
<4-37,Penny>这太尴尬了
<4-37,Penny>Oh, this is very embarrassing.

238
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,030
<4-37,Penny>乐维斯医生  真的很抱歉
<4-37,Penny>Dr. Lorvis, I am so sorry.

239
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:17,520
<4-37,Penny>我不是故意让你误会的
<4-37,Penny>I did not mean to lead you on.

240
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:20,770
<4-38,Dr Lorvis>你把手放在我的胳膊上有两大秒呢
<4-38,Dr Lorvis>You touched my arm for two Mississippis.

241
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:25,070
<4-39,Penny>怪不得你嘴里叨念着几大秒呢
<4-39,Penny>That's why you were mumbling "Mississippi."

242
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:26,950
<4-40,Leonard>我们能借一步说话吗
<4-40,Leonard>Can we talk in private?

243
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:28,090
<4-41,Penny>好的  走吧
<4-41,Penny>Please, yes.

244
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:29,370
<4-42,Leonard>我马上就回来
<4-42,Leonard>I'll be right back.

245
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:35,590
<4-43,Sheldon>你还经手过哪些名人的生殖器
<4-43,Sheldon>So what other celebrity genitalia have you handled?

246
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,450
<4-44,Leonard>怎么回事
<4-44,Leonard>So, uh, what's the deal?

247
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:40,500
<4-44,Leonard>你上班就不戴订婚戒吗
<4-44,Leonard>You take off your ring when you go to work?

248
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,830
<4-45,Penny>什么  没有这回事
<4-45,Penny>What? No! No!

249
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:43,880
<4-45,Penny>我就是戴在另外一只手上
<4-45,Penny>I just put it on the other hand and...

250
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:46,110
<4-45,Penny>再把戒指转个圈
<4-45,Penny>turn it around.

251
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:48,590
<4-45,Penny>然后把手放在口袋里
<4-45,Penny>Keep that hand in my pocket.

252
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,160
<4-46,Leonard>为什么
<4-46,Leonard>Why?

253
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,090
<4-47,Penny>这有什么好奇怪的
<4-47,Penny>Well, what do you mean why?

254
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:52,190
<4-47,Penny>如果医生认为我是单身
<4-47,Penny>Look, I make more sales

255
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:53,580
<4-47,Penny>我就能卖得更多
<4-47,Penny>if these doctors think I'm single.

256
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,330
<4-47,Penny>我做服务员的时候也做过同样的事
<4-47,Penny>I did the same kind of thing as a waitress.

257
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:57,740
<4-47,Penny>我想问的是  他在你的公寓里做什么
<4-47,Penny>The real question is, what is he doing in your apartment?

258
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,050
<4-48,Leonard>他不高兴
<4-48,Leonard>Oh, he was upset.

259
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:02,380
<4-48,Leonard>谢尔顿就请他进屋喝热饮
<4-48,Leonard>So Sheldon invited him in for a hot beverage.

260
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,050
<4-49,Penny>你没意见吗
<4-49,Penny>You were okay with that?

261
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:05,640
<4-50,Leonard>有  我也很不高兴
<4-50,Leonard>No. I got upset!

262
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,310
<4-50,Leonard>然后谢尔顿也给了我一杯热饮
<4-50,Leonard>And Sheldon made me a beverage, too.

263
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,210
<4-51,Penny>他突然出现在我门前
<4-51,Penny>Okay, he just showed up at my door.

264
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:11,840
<4-51,Penny>你不觉得有点奇怪吗
<4-51,Penny>Don't you think that's a little weird?

265
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,380
<4-52,Leonard>是有点  不过他没有恶意
<4-52,Leonard>A little, but... he's basically harmless.

266
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:16,390
<4-52,Leonard>-他其实人挺好的  -好吧
<4-52,Leonard>- He's actually kind of a nice guy. - Okay.

267
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:18,210
<4-53,Penny>总之  我的公司不允许我
<4-53,Penny>Whatever, look, my company does not allow me

268
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:19,840
<4-53,Penny>私下和医生有接触
<4-53,Penny>to socialize with doctors outside of work.

269
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,100
<4-53,Penny>你得赶走他
<4-53,Penny>You got to get rid of him.

270
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,810
<4-54,Leonard>为什么要我去赶走他
<4-54,Leonard>Why am I the one that has to get rid of him?

271
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:25,170
<4-55,Penny>我不能去  他是我最好的客户
<4-55,Penny>I can't do it! He's my best client!

272
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:27,720
<4-56,Leonard>好吧  我来赶走他
<4-56,Leonard>All right, I'll get rid of him.

273
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,910
<4-56,Leonard>不过这次算你欠我的
<4-56,Leonard>But you owe me one.

274
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:32,130
<4-57,Raj>我们要去奥利佛家欣赏他的收集品
<4-57,Raj>Hey, we're going to Oliver's house to see his collection.

275
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:32,800
<4-57,Raj>你要和我们一起去吗
<4-57,Raj>You want to go with us?

276
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,420
<4-58,Leonard>好的
<4-58,Leonard>Yeah, sure.

277
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,810
<4-58,Leonard>你欠我的

278
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,030
<5-1,Leonard>我的上帝啊
<5-1,Leonard>Oh, my God!

279
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,390
<5-2,Sheldon>莱纳德  我错了
<5-2,Sheldon>Leonard, I was wrong.

280
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:56,600
<5-2,Sheldon>天堂真的存在
<5-2,Sheldon>Heaven does exist.

281
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:59,210
<5-2,Sheldon>而天堂就在谢奥区
<5-2,Sheldon>And it's in the basement of a urologist's house

282
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:01,260
<5-2,Sheldon>一个泌尿科医生的地下室里
<5-2,Sheldon>in Sherman Oaks.

283
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:05,940
<5-3,Dr Lorvis>欢迎来到我的"孤独堡垒"
<5-3,Dr Lorvis>Welcome to my Fortress of Solitude.

<5-6,Howard>我想我刚背叛了我的妻子[高潮了]
<5-6,Howard>Oh, I think I just cheated on my wife.

289
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,860
<5-7,Raj>这是电影《地狱男爵》里的那把枪吗
<5-7,Raj>The gun from Hellboy?

290
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:25,640
<5-8,Dr Lorvis>对

<5-10,Dr Lorvis>在一个拍卖上买回来的
<5-10,Dr Lorvis>Bought it at auction.

293
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:30,080
<5-11,Raj>我还期望听到男主角
<5-11,Raj>Oh, I was hoping for a juicy tidbit

294
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,700
<5-11,Raj>朗·普尔曼的蛋蛋奇闻呢
<5-11,Raj>about Ron Perlman's testicles.

295
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:36,770
<5-12,Woman’s voice (off)>奥利佛  我要去玩宾果了
<5-12,Woman’s voice (off)>Oliver! I'm going to play bingo!

<5-14,Howard>真可怜  对吧
<5-14,Howard>Yikes, right?

00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:47,170
<5-15,Raj>我不知道该如何回答
<5-15,Raj>Yeah, I'm not quite sure how to respond.

300
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,290
<5-16,Leonard>大金刚
<5-16,Leonard>Wow, Donkey Kong!

301
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:52,690
<5-16,Leonard>这是我小时候最爱的游戏
<5-16,Leonard>This-this was my game when I was a kid!

302
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:55,070
<5-17,Sheldon>因为这是一个美丽的金发女孩
<5-17,Sheldon>Because it's a story of a pretty blonde girl

303
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:58,760
<5-17,Sheldon>被一个畸形的矮小男人不停追逐的故事吗
<5-17,Sheldon>tirelessly pursued by a small, oddly-shaped man?

304
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,350
<5-18,Leonard>不是  因为我喜欢
<5-18,Leonard>No, because I liked it.

305
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:05,330
<5-19,Sheldon>干嘛一说就炸毛
<5-19,Sheldon>Well, now, don't get defensive.

306
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:08,710
<5-19,Sheldon>你是有点畸形  不过你追到女孩了啊
<5-19,Sheldon>You're oddly-shaped, but you got the girl.

307
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:12,140
<5-20,Dr Lorvis>我注意到莱纳德
<5-20,Dr Lorvis>So, I've noticed Leonard gets teased a lot

308
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:14,320
<5-20,Dr Lorvis>因为和佩妮的感情经常被取笑
<5-20,Dr Lorvis>about his relationship with Penny.

309
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,660
<5-21,Sheldon>是的  如果你也想加入
<5-21,Sheldon>Yes. If you'd like to join in,

310
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:20,970
<5-21,Sheldon>我们一般以爱得好蠢注定失败为开头
<5-21,Sheldon>the premise is their love seems unlikely and doomed to failure.

311
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,470
<5-22,Dr Lorvis>所以你觉得她很快会单身吗
<5-22,Dr Lorvis>So, you think she'll be single soon?

312
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:26,390
<5-23,Sheldon>如果你想加入那个阵营
<5-23,Sheldon>Oh, if you want to get in on the pool,

313
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:27,760
<5-23,Sheldon>一切都太晚了
<5-23,Sheldon>you're too late...

314
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,700
<5-23,Sheldon>那里已经人满为患
<5-23,Sheldon>All the squares have been purchased.

315
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,520
<5-23,Sheldon>有意思
<5-23,Sheldon>Interesting.

316
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,180
<5-24,Dr Lorvis>抱歉  我还有点事要办
<5-24,Dr Lorvis>Excuse me, I have to take care of something.

317
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,630
<5-25,Sheldon>莱纳德  身为你的朋友
<5-25,Sheldon>Leonard, as your friend I feel

318
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:49,160
<5-25,Sheldon>-有件事我必须要告诉你  -什么
<5-25,Sheldon>- I should tell you something. - What?

319
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,950
<5-27,Sheldon>我还在气那个花生酱的事
<5-27,Sheldon>I'm still upset about that peanut sauce.

320
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,160
<6-1,Dr Lorvis>请不要关门好吗
<6-1,Dr Lorvis>Oh, could you hold the door?

321
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,190
<6-2,Amy>-好美的花  -谢谢
<6-2,Amy>- Nice flowers. - Thank you.

322
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,300
<6-3,Dr Lorvis>是送给一个姑娘的
<6-3,Dr Lorvis>They're for a girl.

323
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:03,270
<6-3,Dr Lorvis>我要绵延不绝永无休止地纠缠她
<6-3,Dr Lorvis>Uh, I'm being implacable and relentless.

324
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,800
<6-4,Amy>这姑娘真幸运啊
<6-4,Amy>Isn't she lucky?

325
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,230
<6-5,Dr Lorvis>她给我的信号暧昧不明
<6-5,Dr Lorvis>She keeps sending me mixed signals.

326
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:12,800
<6-5,Dr Lorvis>但我...我想我俩追求的东西是一样的
<6-5,Dr Lorvis>But I-I think we both want the same thing.

327
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,790
<6-6,Amy>追求什么
<6-6,Amy>What's that?

328
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:15,740
<6-7,Dr Lorvis>无条件的爱
<6-7,Dr Lorvis>Unconditional love.

329
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,390
<6-8,Amy>谁不想要这个呢
<6-8,Amy>I guess that's all anybody wants.

330
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:19,610
<6-9,Dr Lorvis>没错
<6-9,Dr Lorvis>I guess so.

331
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:22,930
<6-10,Amy>祝你成功
<6-10,Amy>Well, I hope you get it.

332
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:25,570
<6-11,Dr Lorvis>一大秒  两大秒
<6-11,Dr Lorvis>One Mississippi, two Mississippi.

333
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:35,480
<7-1,Leonard>下一局我们换着头盔玩吧
<7-1,Leonard>Next game, let's switch helmets.

334
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:38,480
<7-2,Sheldon>不要  我戴你那个头盔好蠢
<7-2,Sheldon>No, I'd look silly in that helmet.

335
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:45,810
<7-2,Sheldon>我不能收你的花
<7-2,Sheldon>I-I can't take these.

336
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:46,870
<8-1,Amy>为什么啊
<8-1,Amy>Well, why not?

337
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:48,320
<8-2,Dr Lorvis>你我追求的目标一致
<8-2,Dr Lorvis>I mean, you want what I want.

338
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,210
<8-2,Dr Lorvis>我俩一起拥有过美好的两大秒时间
<8-2,Dr Lorvis>And we had two wonderful Mississippis.

339
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,480
<8-3,Amy>那另一个姑娘怎么办
<8-3,Amy>But what about the other girl?

340
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,400
<8-4,Dr Lorvis>好吧
<8-4,Dr Lorvis>Oh, right.

341
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:59,950
<8-4,Dr Lorvis>我会告诉她只做朋友
<8-4,Dr Lorvis>I'll tell her we should just be friends.

342
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:07,590
<8-5,Penny>乐维斯医生
<8-5,Penny>Dr. Lorvis?

343
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:10,370
<8-6,Dr Lorvis>佩妮  我们还是当朋友吧
<8-6,Dr Lorvis>Penny, we should just be friends.

344
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:13,970
<8-6,Dr Lorvis>你高兴了吧
<8-6,Dr Lorvis>Happy?

345
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:25,090
<9-1,Raj>你觉得这玩意会咬人吗
<9-1,Raj>You think he bites?

346
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,840
<9-2,Howard>把你的头伸进去试试看吧
<9-2,Howard>Stick your hand in there and find out.

347
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,550
<9-3,Raj>上次在动物乐园看山羊时你就骗过我
<9-3,Raj>You fooled me with that goat at the petting zoo.

348
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:33,470
<9-3,Raj>这次休想再骗到我
<9-3,Raj>You will not fool me again.

349
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,830
<9-4,Leonard>乐维斯医生去哪儿了
<9-4,Leonard>I wonder where Dr. Lorvis is.

350
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,250
<9-4,Leonard>他离开好一会儿了
<9-4,Leonard>He's been gone a while.

351
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:41,320
<9-5,Raj>也许是在陪他妈咪玩宾果游戏吧
<9-5,Raj>Maybe he's playing bingo with his mommy.

352
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:45,880
<9-6,Howard>都成年了还这么粘父母  真可悲
<9-6,Howard>It's sad how some guys can't cut the apron strings.

353
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,480
<9-7,Raj>你说这话是特么在逗我吧
<9-7,Raj>Okay, now you're messing with me.

354
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:53,930
<9-8,Leonard>各位  我们被锁这里了
<9-8,Leonard>Uh, guys, we're locked in here.

355
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:57,150
<9-9,Sheldon>今天的好事真是一件接一件啊
<9-9,Sheldon>Oh, this day just keeps getting better!

356
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:04,180
<10-1,Penny>所以你就把他们留在家里玩游戏吗
<10-1,Penny>So, you just left them alone playing games in your house?

357
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:06,130
<10-2,Dr Lorvis>他们玩得挺开心的
<10-2,Dr Lorvis>Well, they seemed happy and...

358
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,130
<10-2,Dr Lorvis>这样我们也有更多时间
<10-2,Dr Lorvis>I thought that would give me time

359
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:10,760
<10-2,Dr Lorvis>能更深入了解彼此
<10-2,Dr Lorvis>for you and I to get to know each other better.

360
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,390
<10-2,Dr Lorvis>这都是遇见你之前的事了
