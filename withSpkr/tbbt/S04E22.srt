1
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:09,420
<1-1,Amy>我不得不说  佩妮  这真有意思
<1-1,Amy>I must say, Penny, this is great fun.

2
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,230
<1-2,Penny>很高兴你玩得这么嗨
<1-2,Penny>Glad you're enjoying yourself.

3
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:13,490
<1-3,Amy>认识你和伯纳黛特前  我的洗手间之旅
<1-3,Amy>Until I met you and Bernadette, my trips to the bathroom

4
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:16,150
<1-3,Amy>只有排泄这一个主题
<1-3,Amy>had been entirely focused on elimination.

5
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:19,560
<1-3,Amy>现在又多了社交功能
<1-3,Amy>Now they have a delightful social aspect.

6
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,460
<1-4,Bernadette>艾米  你之前肯定跟别的女生
<1-4,Bernadette>Amy, you must've been in the bathroom

7
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:23,540
<1-4,Bernadette>一起上过卫生间吧
<1-4,Bernadette>with other women before.

8
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:26,760
<1-5,Amy>当然咯
<1-5,Amy>Of course I have.

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,660
<1-5,Amy>但之前都是陌生人  而且在我
<1-5,Amy>But they were strangers and seemed off-put

10
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:31,350
<1-5,Amy>跟她们隔着小间闲聊时都很不高兴
<1-5,Amy>when I engaged in friendly stall-to-stall chit-chat.

11
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:33,950
<1-6,Bernadette>有些女生不喜欢在没穿内裤时
<1-6,Bernadette>Some women don't like to get chummy

12
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,730
<1-6,Bernadette>被人套近乎
<1-6,Bernadette>when their panties are down.

13
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:39,350
<1-7,Amy>你在里面没事吧  闺蜜
<1-7,Amy>You okay in there, bestie?

14
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:40,630
<1-8,Penny>我没事
<1-8,Penny>I'm fine...

15
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:41,970
<1-9,Amy>我这么问你是因为很多人
<1-9,Amy>The reason I ask is that many people

16
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:43,590
<1-9,Amy>都会"膀胱羞涩"
<1-9,Amy>experience bladder shyness;

17
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,180
<1-9,Amy>就是在聊天的时候没法小...
<1-9,Amy>the inability to pass uri...

18
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,150
<1-10,Penny>喂  我说了我没事了  住嘴吧
<1-10,Penny>Yeah, I said I'm fine. Stop talking to me.

19
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:50,220
<1-11,Amy>她小便的时候总是这么凶吗
<1-11,Amy>She always this crabby when she urinates?

20
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,070
<1-12,Bernadette>其实我俩没那么铁
<1-12,Bernadette>We're really not that close.

21
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,560
<1-13,Penny>去他娘的  待会儿再说吧
<1-13,Penny>Screw it. I'll go later.

22
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,750
<1-14,Amy>那我待会儿还来陪你
<1-14,Amy>And I'll be right by your side.

23
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:01,710
<2-1,Bernadette>我有没有跟你说过普丽娅邀请了
<2-1,Bernadette>Did I tell you Priya invited

24
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,840
<2-1,Bernadette>我和霍华德去跟她和莱纳德一起吃饭
<2-1,Bernadette>me and Howard to have dinner with her and Leonard?

25
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,300
<2-2,Penny>哦  不错啊
<2-2,Penny>Oh, that's nice.

26
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,510
<2-2,Penny>非也非也
<2-2,Penny>No, it's not.

27
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:08,830
<2-3,Amy>她在耍花招
<2-3,Amy>It's a strategic maneuver.

28
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:11,050
<2-3,Amy>莱纳德的新女友在检验伯纳黛特
<2-3,Amy>Leonard's new girlfriend is testing Bernadette's loyalty

29
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:13,190
<2-3,Amy>对你和咱们的忠心呢
<2-3,Amy>to you and the group.

30
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:14,550
<2-3,Amy>那个贱人真狡猾啊
<2-3,Amy>That bitch is crafty.

31
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,150
<2-4,Bernadette>-真的吗  -当然
<2-4,Bernadette>- You think? - Of course.

32
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:21,490
<2-5,Amy>猎豹是怎么对付牛羚群的
<2-5,Amy>How does the cheetah attack a herd of wildebeests?

33
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:23,360
<2-5,Amy>追杀最弱小的成员
<2-5,Amy>By going after its weakest member.

34
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,340
<2-6,Bernadette>为啥我是最弱小的
<2-6,Bernadette>Well, what makes me the weakest member?

35
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:31,060
<2-7,Amy>因为你总轻信别人  而且身材瘦小
<2-7,Amy>Your trusting nature coupled with your teeny-tiny body.

36
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:34,710
<2-7,Amy>你要是在塞伦盖蒂连一分钟都撑不到
<2-7,Amy>You wouldn't last a minute on the Serengeti.

38
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:36,960
<2-8,Penny>好吧  艾米  你这是在犯傻
<2-8,Penny>Okay, Amy, you're being silly.

39
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,320
<2-8,Penny>谁跟谁一起吃饭我才不在乎呢
<2-8,Penny>I'm not concerned about who hangs out with who.

40
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,620
<2-8,Penny>而且我肯定对莱纳德那个
<2-8,Penny>And I certainly don't have a problem

41
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,580
<2-8,Penny>总是化妆太浓的新女友没啥意见
<2-8,Penny>with Leonard's new girlfriend who wears way too much makeup.

42
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:46,970
<2-8,Penny>呜  这鞋好漂亮
<2-8,Penny>Ooh, these are cute.

43
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:48,270
<2-8,Penny>当然我要是买下的话
<2-8,Penny>Of course if I buy them,

44
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:51,290
<2-8,Penny>我就得给同性恋夫妇当代孕妈妈了
<2-8,Penny>I'll have to rent my womb out to a gay couple.

45
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,110
<2-9,Bernadette>无所谓了  我跟她说我去不了
<2-9,Bernadette>It doesn't matter. I'm going to tell her we can't make it.

46
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:57,900
<2-10,Amy>不行  你一定要去
<2-10,Amy>Oh, no. You have to go.

47
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:58,810
<2-11,Bernadette>我不懂了
<2-11,Bernadette>I don't understand.

48
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:01,280
<2-11,Bernadette>我以为我是那只瘦小的牛羚
<2-11,Bernadette>I thought I was a teeny-tiny wildebeest.

49
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:05,270
<2-12,Amy>没错  而且你还在用草莓香味的香波
<2-12,Amy>You are-- with hair that smells like strawberries.

50
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:07,370
<2-12,Amy>我们要充分利用这一点
<2-12,Amy>And we're going to use that to our advantage.

51
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:08,790
<2-13,Penny>打住  你到底在说什么
<2-13,Penny>Wait. What are you talking about?

52
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:10,860
<2-14,Amy>只要接受了邀请  伯纳黛特就成了
<2-14,Amy>By accepting the invitation, Bernadette becomes

53
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,180
<2-14,Amy>敌营里的双面间谍
<2-14,Amy>a double agent inside the enemy camp.

54
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,830
<2-14,Amy>她可以洞悉普丽娅的诡计
<2-14,Amy>She could ferret out Priya's tactics,

55
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:15,930
<2-14,Amy>找到她的弱点
<2-14,Amy>identify her weaknesses

56
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:18,280
<2-14,Amy>并能提供假情报  比如
<2-14,Amy>and feed her false information, such as:

57
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,040
<2-14,Amy>莱纳德是地下斗鸡比赛的常客
<2-14,Amy>Leonard's no stranger to back-alley cockfights.

58
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:24,620
<2-15,Bernadette>不知道啊  我不怎么会撒谎的
<2-15,Bernadette>I don't know. I'm not a very good liar.

59
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:27,200
<2-15,Bernadette>在天主学校时就被罚得不敢撒谎了
<2-15,Bernadette>They kind of whup that out of you in Catholic school.

60
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,900
<2-16,Amy>别担心  我来教你
<2-16,Amy>Don't worry. I'll teach you.

61
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,170
<2-16,Amy>我在童子军里待了两年
<2-16,Amy>I did two years of Cub Scouts

62
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:33,100
<2-16,Amy>都没让他们发现我是女生
<2-16,Amy>before they found out I was a girl.

63
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:37,280
<2-17,Penny>好吧  我不认识你们
<2-17,Penny>Okay, I don't know you people.

64
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,720
<2-17,Penny>我只是个天真的女生
<2-17,Penny>I'm just an innocent woman wondering

65
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,410
<2-17,Penny>不知这家鞋店能否用德士古加油卡
<2-17,Penny>if this shoe store will take my Texaco card.

66
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:45,720
<2-18,Amy>你觉得在你的双峰之间藏一个
<2-18,Amy>How do you feel about concealing a recording device

67
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,930
<2-18,Amy>录音设备怎么样
<2-18,Amy>in the cleavage of your ample bosom?

68
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:51,560
<2-19,Bernadette>我双峰之间容不下任何东西
<2-19,Bernadette>I don't want anything in my ample bosom.

69
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,670
<2-20,Amy>来嘛  小草莓  为咱们牺牲一下呗
<2-20,Amy>Come on, Strawberries. Take one for the team.

70
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,880
<2-20,Amy>生活大爆炸
<2-20,Amy>第四季第二十二集

71
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:23,340
<3-1,Leonard>-好  待会儿见  -好消息
<3-1,Leonard>- Okay, see you later. - Good news.

72
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:27,100
<3-2,Sheldon>我终于设计出了三人象棋
<3-2,Sheldon>I finally have a handle on my idea for three-person chess.

73
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:30,030
<3-3,Leonard>确实是好消息  拜拜
<3-3,Leonard>That is good news. Bye.

74
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,400
<3-4,Sheldon>你知道我是怎么解决
<3-4,Sheldon>Uh, do you know how I solved

75
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,960
<3-4,Sheldon>交战区域中心对称这个问题的吗
<3-4,Sheldon>the balanced center combat-area problem?

76
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,990
<3-4,Sheldon>很简单
<3-4,Sheldon>Five words:

77
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:39,960
<3-4,Sheldon>四边形向三角形的过渡镶嵌
<3-4,Sheldon>transitional quadrilateral to triangular tessellation.

78
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,540
<3-5,Leonard>这  这个很赞
<3-5,Leonard>That... that's brilliant.

79
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,870
<3-6,Sheldon>我就说嘛
<3-6,Sheldon>It's what I do.

80
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:47,610
<3-6,Sheldon>等下  还有哈
<3-6,Sheldon>But wait, there's more.

81
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:50,780
<3-6,Sheldon>我还发明了两个新棋子
<3-6,Sheldon>I also invented two new chess pieces.

82
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:54,420
<3-6,Sheldon>毒蛇  和老妇
<3-6,Sheldon>The serpent... and the old woman.

83
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,720
<3-7,Leonard>好吧  现在我非得问了  这俩怎么玩
<3-7,Leonard>Okay, now I have to ask. What do they do?

84
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,710
<3-8,Sheldon>当毒蛇经过对方的棋子时
<3-8,Sheldon>When the serpent slithers to an opposing player's piece,

85
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,800
<3-8,Sheldon>那个棋子就算中毒了
<3-8,Sheldon>that piece is considered poisoned

86
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,310
<3-8,Sheldon>再走两步之后就会死掉
<3-8,Sheldon>and will die after two more moves.

87
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,970
<3-9,Leonard>好吧
<3-9,Leonard>All right.

88
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:14,550
<3-10,Sheldon>除非  它能及时赶到老妇身边
<3-10,Sheldon>Unless... it gets to the old woman in time,

89
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:17,380
<3-10,Sheldon>这样的话她就能吸出毒液
<3-10,Sheldon>in which case she sucks out the poison,

90
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:21,160
<3-10,Sheldon>并且自己变成太后
<3-10,Sheldon>turning her into the Grand Empress:

91
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:25,000
<3-10,Sheldon>老妇同时集合了
<3-10,Sheldon>a piece combining the power

92
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,050
<3-10,Sheldon>马  后和毒蛇三者的功效
<3-10,Sheldon>of the Knight, Queen and Serpent.

93
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:30,350
<3-11,Leonard>妙极了
<3-11,Leonard>Elegant.

94
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:32,030
<3-12,Sheldon>那是因为简单才妙
<3-12,Sheldon>That's because it's simple.

95
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,930
<3-13,Leonard>好  很期待和你杀一局哦
<3-13,Leonard>Okay, well, I look forward to playing with you.

96
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:37,980
<3-14,Sheldon>还有
<3-14,Sheldon>And...

97
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,540
<3-15,Leonard>还有啥
<3-15,Leonard>And what?

98
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,670
<3-16,Sheldon>第三个人啊
<3-16,Sheldon>And a third person.

99
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:44,090
<3-16,Sheldon>这是三人象棋嘛
<3-16,Sheldon>It's three-person chess.

100
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:45,590
<3-16,Sheldon>我不得不说  自从你开始
<3-16,Sheldon>I must say, ever since you started

101
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:49,640
<3-16,Sheldon>定期交媾之后  你的脑子就没那么好使了
<3-16,Sheldon>having regular intercourse, your mind has lost its keen edge.

102
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,780
<3-16,Sheldon>你应该采取点儿措施的
<3-16,Sheldon>You should reflect on that.

103
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,020
<3-17,Leonard>抱歉  可爱因斯坦性生活也很频繁啊
<3-17,Leonard>Excuse me, but Einstein had a pretty busy sex life.

104
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:59,860
<3-18,Sheldon>所以他没能把引力和其它力统一起来
<3-18,Sheldon>Yes, and he never unified gravity with the other forces.

105
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,930
<3-18,Sheldon>他要是不这么乱搞
<3-18,Sheldon>If he hadn't been such a hound dog,

106
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:04,110
<3-18,Sheldon>我们早就有时光机器了
<3-18,Sheldon>we'd all have time machines.

107
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:06,910
<3-19,Leonard>知道了  拜
<3-19,Leonard>Got it. Bye.

108
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,590
<3-20,Sheldon>你知道哥是对的
<3-20,Sheldon>You know I'm right.

109
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,640
<3-21,Leonard (outside apartment)>他的病情又加重了
<3-21,Leonard (outside apartment)>I think he's getting worse.

110
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,060
<3-22,Amy>嗷  我的跖骨在哀嚎
<3-22,Amy>Oh, my metatarsal are barking.

111
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:24,790
<3-24,Amy>-你还好吗  -没事
<3-24,Amy>- You okay? Yeah, yeah.

112
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,540
<3-24,Amy>我只是穿了双新鞋而已
<3-24,Amy>I'm just breaking in some new shoes.

113
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,590
<3-25,Leonard>-很漂亮  -谢谢
<3-25,Leonard>- Very pretty. - Thank you.

114
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:29,940
<3-26,Amy>你知道女人穿高跟鞋
<3-26,Amy>Did you know that women wear high heels

115
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,270
<3-26,Amy>是为了更加前凸后翘吗
<3-26,Amy>to make the buttocks and breasts more prominent?

116
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,390
<3-27,Leonard>还真没这么想过
<3-27,Leonard>Hadn't really thought about it.

117
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,910
<3-28,Amy>瞧
<3-28,Amy>Look.

118
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:42,370
<3-29,Leonard>呃  没错  相当...翘
<3-29,Leonard>Uh, sure. Very... prominent.

119
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,030
<3-30,Amy>拜托  莱纳德  别乱瞟了
<3-30,Amy>Please, Leonard, don't leer,

<3-34,Amy>我在商场听说的
<3-34,Amy>I heard it at the mall,

126
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:53,480
<3-34,Amy>当时正和闺蜜们一起血拼
<3-34,Amy>when I was shopping with my girlfriends,

127
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,630

<4-2,Leonard>拉杰  你要和我们共进晚餐吗
<4-2,Leonard>Hey, Raj, will you be joining us for dinner?

131
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,900
<4-3,Raj>孤家寡人跟两对甜蜜鸳鸯掺和吗
<4-3,Raj>The lonely guy and the two happy couples?

132
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,220
<4-3,Raj>我还不如找个猥琐男
<4-3,Raj>I'd rather get a prostate exam

133
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:22,880
<4-3,Raj>帮我做前列腺检查直到他断指呢
<4-3,Raj>from a leper who walks away with nine fingers.

134
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:26,350
<4-4,Priya>你能不能不要顾影自怜了
<4-4,Priya>Oh, would you please stop feeling sorry for yourself?

135
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,830
<4-5,Raj>我也是迫于无奈
<4-5,Raj>I have to feel sorry for myself.

136
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,530
<4-5,Raj>因为我是唯一关心自己的人
<4-5,Raj>I'm the only one who cares.

137
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:32,690
<4-5,Raj>就像我是唯一愿意和自己做爱的人一样
<4-5,Raj>Just like I'm the only one who'll have sex with me.

138
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:36,060
<4-6,Leonard>你怎么能在你妹妹面前说这种话
<4-6,Leonard>Really? In front of your sister?

139
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,400
<4-7,Priya>我们从小住在一个房间
<4-7,Priya>We shared a room growing up.

140
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,630
<4-7,Priya>我都听习惯了
<4-7,Priya>This is not news to me.

<4-8,Raj>失陪了  我要去街上独自闲逛一会
<4-8,Raj>Excuse me. I'm going to go wander the streets alone.

142
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:45,200
<4-8,Raj>无人关注  无人需要  无人爱怜
<4-8,Raj>Invisible, unwanted and unloved.

143
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,620
<4-8,Raj>都市里的一剪孤影  无牵无挂
<4-8,Raj>A pathetic shadow in a city with no heart.

144
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:52,980
<4-8,Raj>我忘穿防风夹克了  外面怪冷的
<4-8,Raj>I forgot my windbreaker. It'chilly.

145
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:59,520
<5-1,Amy>我就不明白了  新鞋就这样穿的吗
<5-1,Amy>I don't understand. Is this a way to break in new shoes?

146
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:02,630
<5-2,Penny>不  但这对小宝贝一旦沾地
<5-2,Penny>No. Once these puppies touch the ground

147
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,960
<5-2,Penny>就属于我了  我就要穿着它们
<5-2,Penny>they're mine, and I'll have to wear them

00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,490
<5-2,Penny>在好莱坞大道徘徊
<5-2,Penny>walking up and down Hollywood Boulevard

149
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:07,260
<5-2,Penny>好让它们物有所值
<5-2,Penny>in order to pay them off.

150
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:11,560
<5-2,Penny>美啦  美啦  美啦
<5-2,Penny>Pretty, pretty, pretty.

156
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,700
<5-6,Penny>你不至于吧
<5-6,Penny>Hey. Seriously?

157
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,130
<5-6,Penny>你高中没玩够这种小团体把戏吗
<5-6,Penny>Didn't you get enough of this cliquey crap in high school?

158
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:35,200
<5-7,Amy>我倒也想  但组小团体是需要朋友的
<5-7,Amy>I wish. A clique requires friends.

159
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,690
<5-7,Amy>-而我却没有  -一个都没有吗
<5-7,Amy>- I didn't have any. - None?

160
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:40,050
<5-9,Amy>我以前会把午餐带到保全室

161
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:41,460
<5-9,Amy>和清洁工一起吃
<5-9,Amy>and eat with the janitor.

162
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,710
<5-9,Amy>那种感觉很好  直到他老婆骂我"贱货"
<5-9,Amy>It was nice until his wife called me a puta

163
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:46,210
<5-9,Amy>将我拒之门外
<5-9,Amy>and made me stop.

164

00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,540
<5-9,Amy>是牛羚发来的
<5-9,Amy>It's the wildebeest.

166
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:57,030
<5-9,Amy>普丽娅刚刚挖苦了一番你的演艺事业
<5-9,Amy>Priya just made a snide comment about your acting career.

167
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:59,100
<5-10,Penny>她都说什么了
<5-10,Penny>W-What the hell did she say?

168
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,820
<5-11,Amy>她认为  了不起的是你勇于追梦
<5-11,Amy>She thinks it's cool you're following your dream,

169
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,550
<5-11,Amy>不管这有多难
<5-11,Amy>no matter what.

170
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,790
<5-12,Penny>贱人!
<5-12,Penny>That bitch!

171
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:09,470
<5-13,Amy>你想怎么应对
<5-13,Amy>How do you want to handle it?

172
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:10,750
<5-14,Penny>呃  好吧
<5-14,Penny>Um, okay.

173
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,390
<5-14,Penny>让伯纳黛特告诉普丽娅
<5-14,Penny>Tell Bernadette to tell Priya that

174
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:14,230
<5-14,Penny>我在去布拉格的路上
<5-14,Penny>I'm on my way to Prague

175
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:16,760
<5-14,Penny>准备去和安吉丽娜·朱莉拍电影
<5-14,Penny>to shoot a movie with Angelina Jolie.

176
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,860
<5-14,Penny>明白
<5-14,Penny>Got it.

177
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,080
<5-15,Amy>是3D电影吗
<5-15,Amy>Is it going to be in 3-D?

178
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,110
<5-16,Penny>什么  无所谓  这个不重要
<5-16,Penny>What? I don't know. It doesn't matter.

179
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,280
<5-17,Amy>还是说3D电影吧
<5-17,Amy>I'm gonna say 3-D.

180
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,700
<5-17,Amy>可以让她知道制片方对电影很有信心
<5-17,Amy>That'll let her know the studio has faith in it.

181
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,510
<6-1,Leonard>开什么玩笑  竟然是3D的
<6-1,Leonard>You're kidding. 3-D?

182
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,230
<6-2,Bernadette>听说是这样的
<6-2,Bernadette>That's what I hear.

183
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:37,960
<6-3,Howard>那制片方一定对电影很有信心
<6-3,Howard>Then the studio must have real faith in it.

184
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,080
<6-4,Leonard>她为什么没告诉我呢
<6-4,Leonard>Wonder why she didn't tell me.

185
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,340
<6-5,Priya>你最近经常和你的前女友接触吗
<6-5,Priya>Have you been spending time with your ex-girlfriend?

186
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,680
<6-6,Leonard>没有
<6-6,Leonard>No...

187
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,650
<6-7,Priya>那她没告诉你有什么好奇怪的
<6-7,Priya>Then why are you surprised she didn't tell you?

188
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:52,280
<6-8,Leonard>与其说是"奇怪"
<6-8,Leonard>Well, it's not as much "surprised" as...

189
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:56,550
<6-8,Leonard>不如说是  另一种感觉
<6-8,Leonard>you know... uh... the other thing.

190
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,040
<6-9,Priya>什么感觉
<6-9,Priya>What other thing?

191
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,470
<6-10,Leonard>如果你  呃
<6-10,Leonard>Well, if you... uh...

192
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:06,100
<6-10,Leonard>我不
<6-10,Leonard>I don't... oh...

193
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,910
<6-11,Howard>我想说的是哪个词来着
<6-11,Howard>What's the word I'm looking for?

194
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:11,290
<6-11,Howard>我不会帮你的  看你的囧样太欢乐了
<6-11,Howard>I'm not going to help you. This is hilarious.

195
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:15,900
<6-12,Bernadette>她还在和宇航员谈恋爱
<6-12,Bernadette>She's also dating an astronaut.

196
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:19,830
<6-13,Priya>哇哦  这么厉害啊
<6-13,Priya>Wow. That's very impressive.

197
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:23,180
<6-14,Bernadette>是啊  但莱纳德也很厉害啊
<6-14,Bernadette>Yeah. But Leonard's impressive, too.

198
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,470
<6-14,Bernadette>谢谢
<6-14,Bernadette>Thank you.

199
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,630
<6-15,Leonard>糊涂
<6-15,Leonard>"Befuddled."

200
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:34,340
<6-15,Leonard>"糊涂"这个词很合适
<6-15,Leonard>The word I was looking for was "befuddled."

201
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:43,940
<7-1,Sheldon>马走到老妇...
<7-1,Sheldon>Knight to Old Woman...

202
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:49,390
<7-1,Sheldon>6又1/3位置
<7-1,Sheldon>six-and-a-third.

203
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:58,090
<7-1,Sheldon>妙棋
<7-1,Sheldon>Brilliant move.

204
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:05,000
<7-1,Sheldon>多谢夸奖
<7-1,Sheldon>Thank you.

205
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,680
<7-1,Sheldon>两位失陪一下
<7-1,Sheldon>Will the two of you excuse me?

206
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:18,000
<7-2,Raj>抱抱我吧
<7-2,Raj>I need a hug.

207
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,910
<7-3,Sheldon>抱歉  我家有客人
<7-3,Sheldon>Sorry, I have company.

208
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,100
<7-4,Raj>拜托  谢尔顿  开开门
<7-4,Raj>Come on, Sheldon, open the door.

209
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:32,140
<7-5,Sheldon>我不想抱你
<7-5,Sheldon>I don't want to hug you.

210
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,220
<7-6,Raj>我也不想抱你
<7-6,Raj>I don't want to hug you, either.

211
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:36,060
<7-6,Raj>我只是感觉很郁闷[蓝色]
<7-6,Raj>I was just feeling blue.

212
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,480
<7-7,Sheldon>蓝色  就是郁闷的意思
<7-7,Sheldon>Blue, as in depressed.

213
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,930
<7-8,Raj>还没郁闷到孤独的地步
<7-8,Raj>Well, not so much depressed as lonely.

214
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:43,240
<7-9,Sheldon>我不知道孤独是什么颜色
<7-9,Sheldon>I don't know what color lonely is.

215
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,860
<7-11,Sheldon>-什么  -红色代表愤怒
<7-11,Sheldon>- What? - Red is angry;

216
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,290
<7-11,Sheldon>黄色代表惊恐
<7-11,Sheldon>yellow is frightened;

217
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:50,380
<7-11,Sheldon>绿色代表嫉妒  蓝色代表忧郁
<7-11,Sheldon>green is jealous; and blue is depressed.

218
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:53,560
<7-11,Sheldon>没准咱可以找个颜色来代表孤独
<7-11,Sheldon>Perhaps we can assign a color to lonely.

219
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:57,320
<7-12,Raj>橙色跟啥都不押韵  没准橙色也觉得挺孤独的
<7-12,Raj>Nothing rhymes with orange. It's probably lonely.

220
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:00,840
<7-13,Sheldon>好吧  进来吧
<7-13,Sheldon>All right. Come in.

221
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,630
<7-13,Sheldon>你看起来的确挺橙挺孤独的
<7-13,Sheldon>You look positively orange with loneliness.

222
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,440
<7-13,Sheldon>不行  说起来还是不顺嘴
<7-13,Sheldon>No, I don't see that catching on at all.

223
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:09,050
<7-14,Raj>你在干嘛呢
<7-14,Raj>What are you doing?

224
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:11,060
<7-15,Sheldon>我在研究我的三人国际象棋
<7-15,Sheldon>I'm working on my three-person chess game.

225
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,870
<7-16,Raj>真酷  我能一起玩吗
<7-16,Raj>Oh, cool. Can I play?

226
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,580
<7-15,Sheldon>这是三人象棋
<7-15,Sheldon>It's three-person chess.

227
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,170
<7-17,Sheldon>你带朋友来了吗
<7-17,Sheldon>Did you bring a friend?

228
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:20,950
<7-18,Raj>没
<7-18,Raj>No.

229
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:23,570
<7-19,Sheldon>那我就只好请你思考一下
<7-19,Sheldon>Then as a mental exercise I invite you

230
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:25,810
<7-19,Sheldon>为啥咱俩人
<7-19,Sheldon>to figure out why the two of us

231
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,880
<7-19,Sheldon>没法玩三人象棋了
<7-19,Sheldon>can't play three-person chess.

232
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,540
<7-19,Sheldon>这家伙够迷糊的吧
<7-19,Sheldon>Can you believe this guy?

233
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:36,650
<7-19,Sheldon>然而鉴于人际交往的需要
<7-19,Sheldon>Social protocol does, however,

234
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:38,510
<7-19,Sheldon>我应该在你孤独的时候
<7-19,Sheldon>require me to bring you a hot beverage

235
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:39,730
<7-19,Sheldon>给你来杯热饮
<7-19,Sheldon>in your time of need.

236
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:40,800
<7-20,Raj>不用了  谢谢  我没事
<7-20,Raj>No, thank you. I'm fine.

237
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,660
<7-21,Sheldon>你没的选择
<7-21,Sheldon>It's not optional.

238
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:46,530
<7-21,Sheldon>我们家没茶了  但愿你喜欢牛肉汤
<7-21,Sheldon>We're out of tea. I hope you like bouillon.

239
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:49,350
<7-22,Raj>我猜你大概在琢磨
<7-22,Raj>I, uh, I guess you're probably wondering

240
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:50,520
<7-22,Raj>我为什么会这么郁闷
<7-22,Raj>what's got me down.

241
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,370
<7-23,Sheldon>实际上我在琢磨
<7-23,Sheldon>Actually, I was wondering

242
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:55,070
<7-23,Sheldon>我能不能再加一个新的棋子
<7-23,Sheldon>if I could add a third new chess piece.

243
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:58,300
<7-23,Sheldon>你觉得我加个乔伊王子怎么样
<7-23,Sheldon>How do you think people would feel about Prince Joey--

244
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:02,310
<7-23,Sheldon>他是国王弱智但却心地善良的表弟
<7-23,Sheldon>the king's feeble-minded but well-meaning cousin?

245
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,420
<7-24,Raj>我就快三十岁了
<7-24,Raj>I'm going to be 30 years old,

246
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,550
<7-24,Raj>但我却找不到一个爱我的人
<7-24,Raj>and I have no one in my life to love me.

247
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,360
<7-24,Raj>我真是没救了  我不喝酒的话
<7-24,Raj>I'm such a basket case, I can't even talk to a woman

248
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,600
<7-24,Raj>都没法开口跟女人讲话
<7-24,Raj>without having alcohol in my body.

249
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:13,350
<7-25,Sheldon>乔伊王子有趣的地方就在于
<7-25,Sheldon>The fun thing about Prince Joey

250
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:17,600
<7-25,Sheldon>他每动一次  就有百分之二十的几率
<7-25,Sheldon>is every time he moves, there's a one-in-five chance

251
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,570
<7-25,Sheldon>会自杀
<7-25,Sheldon>he'll kill himself.

252
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,760
<7-26,Raj>谢尔顿  听我说
<7-26,Raj>Sheldon, listen to me.

253
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,760
<7-26,Raj>我要做个重大的决定  而我很害怕
<7-26,Raj>I have a big decision to make, and I'm scared.

254
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,200
<7-27,Sheldon>很黄很害怕  说吧
<7-27,Sheldon>Yellow. Go ahead.

255
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:29,410
<7-28,Raj>我在药学院的一个朋友
<7-28,Raj>A friend at the School of Pharmacology

256
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:31,080
<7-28,Raj>给了我这些他们正在测试的药
<7-28,Raj>gave me these new pills they're testing.

257
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,490
<7-28,Raj>他说这将是治疗社交焦虑障碍领域的
<7-28,Raj>He says it's the next big thing

258
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:34,330
<7-28,Raj>又一奇迹
<7-28,Raj>for social anxiety disorder.

259
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:36,770
<7-29,Sheldon>有意思  这药是什么成分的
<7-29,Sheldon>Fascinating. What's in it?

260
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:37,650
<7-30,Raj>我也不知道
<7-30,Raj>I'm not sure.

261
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:39,950
<7-30,Raj>某种β受体阻断剂跟从牛的尿液中
<7-30,Raj>Some sort of beta-blocker attached to a molecule

262
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:42,440
<7-30,Raj>提取的分子的混合物
<7-30,Raj>extracted from the urine of cows.

263
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:44,690
<7-31,Sheldon>我喜欢牛
<7-31,Sheldon>I like cows.

264
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,460
<7-32,Raj>这不是重点
<7-32,Raj>That's not the point.

265
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:48,420
<7-33,Sheldon>你怎么想不重要  继续说吧
<7-33,Sheldon>It was its own point. Go on.

266
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,500
<7-34,Raj>我是个科学家
<7-34,Raj>I'm a scientist.

267
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,000
<7-34,Raj>我靠我的思考能力吃饭
<7-34,Raj>My ability to think is my bread and butter.

268
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,620
<7-34,Raj>我怕我吃了这个药以后  可能会丧失那些
<7-34,Raj>I'm afraid if I take this, I might lose

269
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,740
<7-34,Raj>让我在我的领域里
<7-34,Raj>that special, unique something

270
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:59,230
<7-34,Raj>如此成功的特质
<7-34,Raj>that makes me so successful in my field.

271
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:02,650
<7-35,Sheldon>拉杰  我有幸
<7-35,Sheldon>Rajesh, I've had the privilege

272
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:05,740
<7-35,Sheldon>跟你一起共事了多年
<7-35,Sheldon>of working alongside you for many years.

273
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,380
<7-35,Sheldon>我建议你就跟吃糖豆一样
<7-35,Sheldon>My recommendation is that

274
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:10,080
<7-35,Sheldon>把这些药都吞了吧
<7-35,Sheldon>you gobble these up like Tic Tacs.

275
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:18,290
<8-1,Howard>好吧  我还在琢磨这事呢
<8-1,Howard>Okay, I'm still trying to work this out.

276
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:21,600
<8-1,Howard>佩妮是怎么搭上一个宇航员的
<8-1,Howard>How did Penny meet an astronaut?

277
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,460
<8-1,Howard>我也不知道
<8-1,Howard>I don't know.

278
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,880
<8-2,Bernadette>就正常这么搭上的呗
<8-2,Bernadette>The regular way people meet astronauts.

279
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,960
<8-3,Howard>宇航员大多都住在德克萨斯州呀
<8-3,Howard>Most of those guys live in Texas.

280
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,550
<8-4,Bernadette>显然这哥们儿不住那儿
<8-4,Bernadette>Obviously, this one doesn't.

281
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,870
<8-5,Howard>好吧
<8-5,Howard>Okay.

282
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,520
<8-6,Bernadette>莱纳德住在美国  而普丽娅是印度来的
<8-6,Bernadette>Leonard lives here. Priya's from India.

283
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,900
<8-6,Bernadette>结果不也认识了嘛  霍华德  你搞什么
<8-6,Bernadette>People meet, Howard. God!

284
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:39,940
<8-7,Howard>好吧
<8-7,Howard>Fine.

285
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,340
<8-8,Bernadette>你也认识过不少宇航员
<8-8,Bernadette>You've met lots of astronauts,

286
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:43,560
<8-8,Bernadette>我可从来都没拷问你是怎么认识的
<8-8,Bernadette>and I've never grilled you about that.

287
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,690
<8-8,Bernadette>谢谢你以怨报德
<8-8,Bernadette>I'd thank you to extend me the same courtesy.

288
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,750
<8-9,Howard>我没拷问你  我只是好奇而已
<8-9,Howard>I'm not grilling you; I was just curious.

289
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:54,630
<8-10,Leonard>我还在琢磨她居然要出演大片这件事呢
<8-10,Leonard>I still can't get over the fact that she got a big movie part.

290
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:59,150
<8-10,Leonard>倒不是因为我在乎我前女友的事  我真不在乎
<8-10,Leonard>Not that I care what my ex-girlfriend's up to, 'cause I don't.

291
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:03,150
<8-11,Bernadette>也许她就是在片场认识那个宇航员的呢
<8-11,Bernadette>Maybe that's where she met the astronaut, all right?

292
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:05,210
<8-12,Priya>不好意思  可是宇航员
<8-12,Priya>I'm sorry. What would an astronaut be doing

293
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:06,870
<8-12,Priya>跑到片场去干嘛呀
<8-12,Priya>working on a movie?

294
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,590
<8-13,Bernadette>他是顾问
<8-13,Bernadette>He's a consultant.

295
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,680
<8-14,Leonard>你不是说这部电影是关于十八世纪的维也纳的吗
<8-14,Leonard>I thought the movie was about 18th-century Vienna.

296
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,880
<8-15,Bernadette>他就不能有点业余爱好吗
<8-15,Bernadette>He can't have a hobby?!

297
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,450
<8-15,Bernadette>失陪一下  我要去洗手间了
<8-15,Bernadette>Excuse me, I have to pee.

298
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:23,130
<8-15,Bernadette>你们是不是觉得这件事也很不可思议
<8-15,Bernadette>Or is that implausible, as well?!

299
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:30,130
<8-16,Howard>两对情侣一起玩就是好  对吧
<8-16,Howard>It's nice to have another couple to hang with, isn't it?

300
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,570
<9-1,Penny (to the shoes)>好了  宝贝儿  你们得回家了
<9-1,Penny (to the shoes)>All right, guys, you have to go back.

301
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:34,980
<9-1,Penny (to the shoes)>我可负担不起你们
<9-1,Penny (to the shoes)>I can't afford you.

302
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:38,570
<9-1,Penny (to the shoes)>不  别抛弃我们  我们爱你
<9-1,Penny (to the shoes)>No, don't send us away; we love you.

303
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:43,840
<6-14,Bernadette>我也爱你们  但你们比我的房租还贵
<6-14,Bernadette>I love you, too, but you cost more than my rent.

304
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,310
<6-14,Bernadette>但是佩妮  你穿上我们之后很漂亮呀
<6-14,Bernadette>But, Penny, you look so good in us.

305
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:49,770
<9-1,Penny (to the shoes)>该死的  鞋说的对
<9-1,Penny (to the shoes)>Damn it, the shoes are right.

306
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:53,410
<9-2,Amy>天啊  佩妮  你还是真是鬼点子多多呀
<9-2,Amy>Good golly, Penny, your whimsy is boundless.

307
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:59,950
<9-2,Amy>进展如何了  牛羚
<9-2,Amy>What do you got for me, wildebeest?

308
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:02,340
<9-3,Bernadette (in Raj’s bathroom)>我觉得他们在逼问我
<9-3,Bernadette (in Raj’s bathroom)>I think they're on to me.

309
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,450
<9-3,Bernadette (in Raj’s bathroom)>这故事开始漏洞百出了
<9-3,Bernadette (in Raj’s bathroom)>The story's starting to fall apart.

310
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:06,410
<9-4,Amy>冷静点  没事的
<9-4,Amy>Calm down. Everything's going to be okay.

311
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:08,090
<9-4,Amy>我们或许得杀她灭口了
<9-4,Amy>We may have to kill her.

312
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,450
<9-4,Amy>伯纳黛特  我开免提了
<9-4,Amy>Bernadette, I'm putting you on speakerphone.

313
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:13,270
<9-4,Amy>你在哪呢
<9-4,Amy>Where are you now?

314
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:14,320
<9-5,Bernadette>在洗手间
<9-5,Bernadette>In the bathroom.

315
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,260
<9-6,Amy>不错嘛
<9-6,Amy>Oh, look at this,

316
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:17,810
<9-6,Amy>又一次经典的洗手间对话
<9-6,Amy>another one of our classic bathroom gabfests.

317
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,410
<9-6,Amy>到底是怎么回事
<9-6,Amy>What's the problem?

318
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:21,210
<9-7,Bernadette>他们在问我
<9-7,Bernadette>They're just asking me

319
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:23,510
<9-7,Bernadette>一堆我回答不上来的问题
<9-7,Bernadette>all sorts of questions I can't answer.

320
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:25,250
<9-8,Amy>那就换话题呀
<9-8,Amy>Just change the subject.

321
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,220
<9-9,Bernadette>我想我应该可以让他们继续聊
<9-9,Bernadette>I suppose I could get them back to talking about Leonard

322
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,600
<9-9,Bernadette>莱纳德去印度见普丽娅父母的事
<9-9,Bernadette>going to India to meet Priya's parents.

323
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:31,300
<9-10,Penny>什么
<9-10,Penny>What?!

324
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,570
<9-11,Bernadette>他们好像说今年夏天一起去印度
<9-11,Bernadette>They said something about going there this summer.

325
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:35,310
<9-12,Penny>什么  他们要订婚吗
<9-12,Penny>What, are they getting engaged?

326
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:38,200
<9-13,Bernadette>我不知道  我忙着自圆其说呢
<9-13,Bernadette>I don't know. I was too busy covering my heinie

327
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,680
<9-13,Bernadette>都是艾米说什么宇航员害的
<9-13,Bernadette>on Amy's stupid astronaut story!

328
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:43,580
<9-14,Amy>什么宇航员
<9-14,Amy>What astronaut story?

329
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,740
<9-15,Bernadette>你短信说佩妮在跟个宇航员约会
<9-15,Bernadette>You texted me Penny's dating an astronaut.

330
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,510
<9-16,Amy>我发的是"建筑师"  真好玩
<9-16,Amy>I texted "architect." That's amusing.

331
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:49,460
<9-16,Amy>肯定是自动纠错帮我改的
<9-16,Amy>Auto-correct must've changed it.

332
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,390
<9-17,Bernadette>是啊  太好笑了
<9-17,Bernadette>Yeah, it's hysterical.

333
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,040
<9-18,Penny>好吧  反正别提宇航员的事了
<9-18,Penny>All right, look, just forget about the astronaut.

334
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,370
<9-19,Amy>是建筑师  你上哪去认识宇航员
<9-19,Amy>Architect. Where would you have met an astronaut?

335
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,180
<9-20,Penny>一定要问去印度怎么回事就好了
<9-20,Penny>Look, just find out what's up with this trip to India.

336
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,590
<9-21,Bernadette>我再也不想干这事了
<9-21,Bernadette>I don't want to do this anymore!

337
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,280
<9-22,Penny>你敢
<9-22,Penny>Don't you quit on us!

338
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,580
<9-23,Howard (knocking on bathroom door)>妮妮  你没事吧
<9-23,Howard (knocking on bathroom door)>Bernie, you okay?

339
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:12,070
<9-24,Bernadette (screaming)>原来是个建筑师
<9-24,Bernadette (screaming)>It was an architect!
