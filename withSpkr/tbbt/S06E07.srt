23
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,750
<1-5,Amy>威尔  你有点太呆板了
<1-5,Amy>Wil, that was a little wooden.

24
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:07,700
<1-6,Wil>呆板吗
<1-6,Wil>Wooden?

25
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,250
<1-7,Amy>别担心  也没那么烂
<1-7,Amy>Don't worry, it wasn't terrible.

<1-7,Amy>但这次可以像正常人一样说话吗
<1-7,Amy>Just, this time, try to say it the way people sound.

<1-10,Sheldon>威尔  你将从哪一面旗帜开始介绍呢
<1-10,Sheldon>So, Wil, what do you have for us first?

32
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:26,180
<1-22,Sheldon>这面旗非常有意思
<1-22,Sheldon>Well, this is an exciting one.

33
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,710
<1-23,Wil>这是星际联邦的旗帜
<1-23,Wil>This is the flag of the United Federation of Planets.

34
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,750
<1-20,Wil>-这面旗有趣的地方在于...  -停
<1-20,Wil>- Now what's interesting about this flag... - Cut.

35
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:33,760
<1-17,Amy>又怎么了
<1-17,Amy>What was wrong with that?

36
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,600
<1-14,Amy>这节目叫"有趣"的旗帜
<1-14,Amy>It's called "Fun with Flags."

37
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,550
<1-14,Amy>不是有人死了在降半旗哀悼
<1-14,Amy>They're not at half-mast, nobody died.

38
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:40,210
<1-14,Amy>欢乐喜庆点好不好
<1-14,Amy>Let's try and keep it upbeat.

39
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,340
<1-15,Wil>我无意冒犯
<1-15,Wil>Um, no offense,

40
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,020
<1-15,Wil>但我从小就开始演戏
<1-15,Wil>but I've been acting since I was a kid.

41
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,440
<1-15,Wil>上个网络节目
<1-15,Wil>I think I can handle a Web show

42
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,670
<1-15,Wil>我应该不需要人家教
<1-15,Wil>without a lot of direction.

43
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:48,730
<1-15,Wil>此话不假
<1-15,Wil>It's true.

44
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:50,810
<1-16,Sheldon>在1982年  威尔就替卡通电影
<1-16,Sheldon>In 1982, Wil played the voice

45
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:53,400
<1-16,Sheldon>《勇敢鼠妈妈》里的一角配音了
<1-16,Sheldon>of Martin the mouse in The Secret of NIMH.

46
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,930
<1-16,Sheldon>你感动了我
<1-16,Sheldon>You moved me.

47
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,730
<1-17,Amy>原谅我的吹毛求疵
<1-17,Amy>You'll have to forgive me.

48
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:00,810
<1-17,Amy>我第一次当导演  只想尽善尽美
<1-17,Amy>This is my first time directing, I just want it to be good.

49
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,270
<1-18,Wil>-我也是  -很好
<1-18,Wil>- So do I. - Great.

50
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,710
<1-19,Amy>那这次就请你
<1-19,Amy>So, this time let's try

51
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,940
<1-19,Amy>像个真男孩  而非小木偶
<1-19,Amy>more real boy, less Pinocchio.

52
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,640
<1-19,Amy>开拍
<1-19,Amy>And action.

53
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,060
<1-20,Wil>停
<1-20,Wil>And cut.

54
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:13,170
<1-20,Wil>你知道我是无偿友情客串的吧
<1-20,Wil>You realize that I'm doing this for free, right?

55
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:17,340
<1-21,Amy>但目前为止  无偿都有点不值回票价呢
<1-21,Amy>Yes. And so far, we're still not getting our money's worth.

56
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,880
<1-21,Amy>再来一次
<1-21,Amy>Let's try it again.

57
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:23,580
<1-21,Amy>大家开开心心
<1-21,Amy>Everybody's having fun.

58
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:26,060
<1-21,Amy>开拍
<1-21,Amy>And action.

59
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,620
<1-22,Sheldon>威尔
<1-22,Sheldon>So, Wil...

60
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,290
<1-22,Sheldon>你要先介绍哪面旗帜呢
<1-22,Sheldon>...what do you have for us first?

61
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:41,850
<1-23,Wil>这面旗十分有意思哦
<1-23,Wil>Well, this is an exciting one.

62
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:43,350
<1-23,Wil>这面旗
<1-23,Wil>This is the flag

63
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:45,520
<1-23,Wil>可是星际联邦的旗帜
<1-23,Wil>of the United Federation of Planets.

64
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,700
<1-24,Amy>停
<1-24,Amy>Cut.

65
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:50,370
<1-25,Wil>有问题吗  "新手"导演
<1-25,Wil>Problem, first-time director?

66
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,700
<1-26,Sheldon>我是没发现啦
<1-26,Sheldon>Oh, none that I could see.

67
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,630
<1-26,Sheldon>我只觉得你跟我一样热爱旗子
<1-26,Sheldon>I saw a man who loved flags almost as much as I do.

68
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,660
<1-26,Sheldon>都起鸡皮疙瘩了
<1-26,Sheldon>I got goose bumps.

69
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,240
<1-27,Amy>他故意夸张演出
<1-27,Amy>He was overacting on purpose.

70
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,160
<1-28,Sheldon>真的吗
<1-28,Sheldon>Really?

71
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,910
<1-28,Sheldon>让我想起电影里寇克船长小时候呢
<1-28,Sheldon>He reminded me of a young William Shatner.

72
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,030
<1-29,Wil>谢尔顿  我很乐意上你节目
<1-29,Wil>Listen, Sheldon, I'm really happy to do this for you,

73
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:09,380
<1-29,Wil>但她要在这当找茬精的话  那就算了吧
<1-29,Wil>but not if she's gonna be a huge pain in the ass the whole time.

74
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,120
<1-30,Amy>他这么说我  你居然没意见吗
<1-30,Amy>You gonna let him speak to me like that?

75
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,720
<1-30,Amy>这个嘛...
<1-30,Amy>Well...

76
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,910
<1-31,Sheldon>你是我女朋友
<1-31,Sheldon>you're my girlfriend

77
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,920
<1-31,Sheldon>我不想你不高兴
<1-31,Sheldon>and I don't want you to be upset.

78
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,800
<1-31,Sheldon>但威尔·惠顿也是我朋友
<1-31,Sheldon>Then again, Wil Wheaton's my friend

79
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,110
<1-31,Sheldon>我也不想他不高兴
<1-31,Sheldon>and I don't want him to be upset.

80
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:27,200
<1-31,Sheldon>真是进退两难啊
<1-31,Sheldon>This is a sticky wicket.

81
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:30,070
<1-31,Sheldon>你有什么看法
<1-31,Sheldon>What do you think?

82
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:32,920
<1-32,Amy>我们去一边谈谈
<1-32,Amy>Can I speak to you for a second?

83
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,710
<1-33,Sheldon>我马上回来
<1-33,Sheldon>I'll be right back.

84
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:37,170
<1-33,Sheldon>欢迎你"自娱自乐"
<1-33,Sheldon>Feel free to play with yourself.

85
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:45,620
<1-34,Amy>我不管他是不是你朋友
<1-34,Amy>I don't care for your friend,

86
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,220
<1-34,Amy>他对我出言不逊
<1-34,Amy>he's being rude to me.

87
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,560
<1-34,Amy>你得叫他滚蛋
<1-34,Amy>You need to ask him to leave.

88
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:51,550
<1-35,Sheldon>艾米  你怎么能叫他滚蛋呢
<1-35,Sheldon>Amy, I can't just ask Wil Wheaton to leave.

89
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,570
<1-35,Sheldon>他好歹也是个二线明星
<1-35,Sheldon>He's a minor celebrity.

90
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:57,350
<1-35,Sheldon>只需费点唇舌解释  人们还是能认出他的
<1-35,Sheldon>Once you explain who he is, many people recognize him.

91
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,440
<1-36,Amy>行  那我走可以了吧
<1-36,Amy>Fine. Then maybe I should go.

92
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,880
<1-37,Sheldon>真的吗  那问题就能迎刃而解了
<1-37,Sheldon>Could you? That would solve everything.

93
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,650
<1-37,Sheldon>你最好了
<1-37,Sheldon>You are the best.

94
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:08,590
<1-37,Sheldon>今晚晚餐见吗
<1-37,Sheldon>I'll see you at dinner tonight?

95
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,820
<1-38,Amy>你不会想跟你的好友威尔
<1-38,Amy>You sure you wouldn't rather have dinner

96
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,050
<1-38,Amy>一起共进晚餐吗
<1-38,Amy>with your friend Wil Wheaton?

97
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:13,050
<1-39,Sheldon>细想一下  我还真想呢
<1-39,Sheldon>Come to think of it, I would!

98
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:17,240
<1-39,Sheldon>小妞你今天棒呆啦
<1-39,Sheldon>You, little lady, are on fire.

100
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:45,870
<2-1,Bernadette>每次来吃晚饭
<2-1,Bernadette>Every time we eat dinner here,

101
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:48,230
<2-1,Bernadette>你妈妈都不让我帮忙洗碗
<2-1,Bernadette>your mother refuses to let me help with the dishes.

102
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,010
<2-1,Bernadette>别往心里去  她想自己洗碗
<2-1,Bernadette>Don't take it personally. She likes doing them by herself

103
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:53,850
<2-2,Howard>单纯是怕被别人看她偷舔碗盘
<2-2,Howard>so she can lick the plates with no one looking.

104
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,670
<2-3,Bernadette>准备好要回去了吗
<2-3,Bernadette>You ready to go?

105
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:59,820
<2-4,Howard>行  我拿几件洗好的高领衣就走
<2-4,Howard>Yeah, let me just grab a couple of fresh turtlenecks.

106
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,820
<2-5,Bernadette>咱们家那么多地方  干嘛还要把东西
<2-5,Bernadette>I don't understand why you keep your stuff here

107
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,620
<2-5,Bernadette>统统都留在这里啊
<2-5,Bernadette>when there's plenty of room at home.

108
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,280
<2-6,Howard>哪有这回事
<2-6,Howard>What are you talking about?

109
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,210
<2-6,Howard>我就留了几件外套
<2-6,Howard>All I have here is a few sweaters,

110
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:10,180
<2-6,Howard>书  银行东西  电脑
<2-6,Howard>books, bank stuff, computers,

111
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:13,250
<2-6,Howard>信件  收藏品  药物跟电动除毛机
<2-6,Howard>mail, collectibles, medicine and my electric body groomer.

112
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,640
<2-6,Howard>我的格子纹小围脖
<2-6,Howard>Ooh, there's my plaid dickie.

113
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,710
<2-6,Howard>我在二手店花五毛钱买到的呢
<2-6,Howard>Oh, got this at the Goodwill store for 50 cents.

114
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:21,630
<2-6,Howard>不敢相信吧
<2-6,Howard>Can you believe it?

115
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,100
<2-7,Bernadette>感觉就值这个价呀
<2-7,Bernadette>50 cents sounds right.

116
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:29,630
<2-7,Bernadette>走吧
<2-7,Bernadette>Let's go.

117
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:30,890
<2-8,Howard>有点晚了呢
<2-8,Howard>You know, it's kinda late.

118
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:32,490
<2-8,Howard>何不干脆在这里过夜
<2-8,Howard>Why don't we just spend the night here?

119
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:34,090
<2-9,Bernadette>因为我们不住在这里啊
<2-9,Bernadette>Because we don't live here.

120
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:35,360
<2-10,Howard>我知道
<2-10,Howard>I know.

121
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,360
<2-11,Bernadette>你真知道吗  你自己说
<2-11,Bernadette>Do you? You said when you got back from space

122
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,890
<2-11,Bernadette>从太空回来后就搬进我公寓
<2-11,Bernadette>you were gonna move into my apartment,

123
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:40,530
<2-11,Bernadette>但半数时间我们都住这里
<2-11,Bernadette>but half the time we stay here.

124
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,800
<2-12,Howard>才没有呢
<2-12,Howard>That's not true.

125
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,710
<2-13,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>霍华德  我要洗衣服了
<2-13,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>Howard, I'm doing laundry!

126
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:47,100
<2-13,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>有什么需要我帮你洗的吗
<2-13,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>You want me to put anything in for you?!

127
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,030
<2-14,Howard>篮子里有我的内裤  拿去洗吧
<2-14,Howard>There's some underwear in the hamper!

128
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,500
<2-15,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>非常好  我刚好要试试新去渍棒
<2-15,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>Oh, good! I got that new stain stick to try out!

129
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:59,820
<2-16,Howard>谢谢你做我"两周前"要求的事啊
<2-16,Howard>Thank you! I only put it on the list two weeks ago!

130
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,680
<2-16,Howard>好吧  我懂你意思了
<2-16,Howard>Okay, I see what you're getting at.

131
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,700
<2-16,Howard>要不这周末吧
<2-16,Howard>How about this weekend

132
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:11,820
<2-16,Howard>我把所有东西都打包搬回咱家
<2-16,Howard>I'll box up all my things and move them to our place.

133
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,320
<2-17,Bernadette>谢谢
<2-17,Bernadette>Thank you.

134
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,960
<2-18,Howard>这两把光剑放在我们客厅肯定很帅
<2-18,Howard>The lightsabers are gonna look great in the living room.

135
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,330
<2-19,Bernadette>放衣柜里也不错  到时候决定吧
<2-19,Bernadette>Or in the closet. We can decide later.

136
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,090
<2-20,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>霍华德  帮帮忙
<2-20,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>Howard, help!

137
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:24,390
<2-20,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>我的手卡在食物垃圾处理机里了
<2-20,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>My hand's stuck in the garbage disposal!

138
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:28,130
<2-21,Howard>那你把手里抓着不放的食物放开啊
<2-21,Howard>Let go of whatever piece of food you're holding!

139
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,700
<2-22,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>你不是吧
<2-22,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>Are you kidding?!

140
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:32,880
<2-22,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>是一根完好无缺的好鸡腿呢
<2-22,Mrs Wolowitz (off)>It's a perfectly good chicken leg!

141
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:38,510
<3-1,Leonard>某人像个大男孩一样  夜游晚归哦
<3-1,Leonard>Hey, look who's out after dark, like a big boy.

142
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:42,300
<3-2,Sheldon>我跟威尔·惠顿去共进晚餐了
<3-2,Sheldon>I was out raising heck with Mr. Wil Wheaton.

143
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,620
<3-2,Sheldon>再让我们吃个四小时
<3-2,Sheldon>Four hours more and we would have

144
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,800
<3-2,Sheldon>就能吃垮"家乡"自助餐厅了
<3-2,Sheldon>closed down the HomeTown Buffet.

145
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:49,130
<3-3,Leonard>-你不是跟艾米有约了吗  -是啊
<3-3,Leonard>- I thought you had plans with Amy. - Yeah, I did,

146
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:53,020
<3-4,Sheldon>但威尔说艾米是找茬精
<3-4,Sheldon>but then Wil called Amy a pain in the A-S-S.

147
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:54,960
<3-4,Sheldon>她就不爽走人了
<3-4,Sheldon>She got huffy and left,

148
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,780
<3-4,Sheldon>然后我就跟威尔一起去吃晚饭了
<3-4,Sheldon>then Wil and I headed out to dinner.

149
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:00,100
<3-4,Sheldon>"家乡"自助餐厅  真的有家乡味呢
<3-4,Sheldon>That place really did remind me of my hometown.

150
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:04,310
<3-4,Sheldon>因为我家乡也有一家"家乡"自助餐厅
<3-4,Sheldon>Because there we also have a HomeTown Buffet.

151
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:08,070
<3-5,Leonard>等等  威尔跟艾米吵架啦
<3-5,Leonard>Hold on. Wil and Amy had an argument?

152
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:10,300
<3-6,Sheldon>对啊  挺剑拔弩张的
<3-6,Sheldon>Yes, quite the kerfuffle.

153
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,320
<3-7,Leonard>然后艾米火大走人啦
<3-7,Leonard>Then Amy got mad and left?

154
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,090
<3-8,Sheldon>夺门而出  一去不返
<3-8,Sheldon>Walked right out the door.

155
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:15,460
<3-9,Leonard>然后你...
<3-9,Leonard>And you...?

156
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:18,700
<3-10,Sheldon>跟威尔开心地吃了顿好价钱的晚饭
<3-10,Sheldon>Enjoyed a delightful dinner at a reasonable price.

157
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,710
<3-10,Sheldon>餐厅经理认出了威尔
<3-10,Sheldon>The manager recognized Wil

158
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:24,400
<3-10,Sheldon>同意让我们坐在冰酸奶机旁呢
<3-10,Sheldon>and let us sit right next to the frozen yogurt machine.

159
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:26,220
<3-10,Sheldon>正旁边哦
<3-10,Sheldon>Right next to it!

160
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,170
<3-10,Sheldon>比我现在跟你的距离还近呢
<3-10,Sheldon>I was closer to it than I am to you right now.

161
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,360
<3-11,Leonard>兄弟  艾米可能在不高兴哦
<3-11,Leonard>Buddy, I think Amy might be upset.

162
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:35,710
<3-12,Sheldon>为啥啊
<3-12,Sheldon>Why's that?

163
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:37,490
<3-13,Leonard>你的朋友对她出言不逊
<3-13,Leonard>Because your friend was rude to her,

164
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,700
<3-13,Leonard>你还跟他一起去吃晚饭
<3-13,Leonard>and then you went to dinner with him.

165
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,820
<3-14,Sheldon>这不就是我刚才说的而已吗
<3-14,Sheldon>You're just repeating what I said.

166
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:45,200
<3-14,Sheldon>你这只乳糖不耐症的学舌鹦鹉
<3-14,Sheldon>It's like living with a lactose-intolerant parrot.

167
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,610
<3-15,Leonard>听我的  打给她吧
<3-15,Leonard>Trust me, call her.

168
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:53,640
<3-16,Sheldon>行  你没跟我们一起吃晚餐  真可惜
<3-16,Sheldon>Fine. It's a shame you didn't go to dinner with us,

169
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,130
<3-16,Sheldon>因为你等下就只能尝到
<3-16,Sheldon>because the buffet you're about to enjoy

170
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:56,930
<3-16,Sheldon>屈辱的滋味了
<3-16,Sheldon>only serves humble pie,

171
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:59,620
<3-16,Sheldon>跟冰酸奶的味道完全不能比哦
<3-16,Sheldon>a dessert much less tasty than frozen yogurt.

172
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,400
<3-16,Sheldon>当时就坐这么近
<3-16,Sheldon>I was this close.

173
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,060
<3-17,Amy (on skype)>有何贵干
<3-17,Amy (on skype)>What?

174
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:08,710
<3-18,Sheldon>跟你说个笑话
<3-18,Sheldon>You'll appreciate this.

175
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:11,540
<3-18,Sheldon>莱纳德脑子抽风  说你在气我
<3-18,Sheldon>Leonard has some ridiculous notion that you're mad at me.

176
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,310
<3-18,Sheldon>告诉他没这回事
<3-18,Sheldon>Tell him you're not mad at me.

177
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,680
<3-18,Sheldon>说吧  给他个痛快
<3-18,Sheldon>Go ahead, set him straight.

178
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,670
<3-19,Amy>我是气你啊  谢尔顿
<3-19,Amy>I'm mad at you, Sheldon.

179
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,860
<3-20,Sheldon>吃根巧克力棒吧
<3-20,Sheldon>Eat one of your Luna bars.

180
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,890
<3-20,Sheldon>女人常以为自己在愤怒
<3-20,Sheldon>Very often when women think they're angry,

181
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:25,680
<3-20,Sheldon>其实只是肚子饿而已啦
<3-20,Sheldon>they're really just hungry.

182
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,480
<3-21,Amy>我不饿
<3-21,Amy>I'm not hungry.

183
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,330
<3-21,Amy>你朋友羞辱我  你也不干嘛
<3-21,Amy>Your friend insulted me, and you didn't do anything.

184
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:35,590
<3-22,Sheldon>对啊  我什么都没干啊
<3-22,Sheldon>Precisely, I didn't do anything.

185
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:40,000
<3-22,Sheldon>某人是不是该仔细想想自己在说啥啊
<3-22,Sheldon>Now does someone feel like checking her emotional math?

186
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,910
<3-23,Leonard>继续吧兄弟  我看好你哦
<3-23,Leonard>Keep going, buddy, you're doing great.

187
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,230
<3-24,Amy>谢尔顿  我是你女朋友
<3-24,Amy>Sheldon, I'm your girlfriend,

188
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:47,070
<3-24,Amy>你应该帮我的才对啊
<3-24,Amy>and you should have taken my side.

189
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:50,300
<3-24,Amy>就这样吧  我说完了  晚安
<3-24,Amy>That's it. End of story. Good night.

190
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:56,800
<3-25,Sheldon>哎哟  艾米在生气  莱纳德说得对
<3-25,Sheldon>Wow, Amy's mad and Leonard was right.

191
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,710
<3-25,Sheldon>今天真不可思议
<3-25,Sheldon>What a weird day.

192
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,290
<4-1,Penny>抱歉  让你们等这么久
<4-1,Penny>Hey. Sorry this took so long.

193
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:05,280
<4-1,Penny>你以前也在这打工过  你懂得
<4-1,Penny>But you used to work here, you know how it is.

194
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,580
<4-2,Bernadette>厨房又出事了吗
<4-2,Bernadette>Kitchen slammed again?

195
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,970
<4-3,Penny>是我只是个烂服务生  忘了吗
<4-3,Penny>No, I'm a terrible waitress, remember?

196
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,840
<4-4,Bernadette>你明天要搬家
<4-4,Bernadette>So, is there anything I can do

197
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,400
<4-4,Bernadette>我有什么能帮你的吗
<4-4,Bernadette>to help you with the move tomorrow?

198
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:14,740
<4-5,Howard>正好你提到此事
<4-5,Howard>Now that you mention it,

199
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:17,850
<4-5,Howard>我觉得明天不是一个搬家的好日子
<4-5,Howard>I was thinking tomorrow might not be great.

200
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:21,200
<4-6,Bernadette>-你又有什么借口了  -没借口
<4-6,Bernadette>- What's your excuse this time? - No excuse.

201
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,580
<4-7,Howard>只是呢  我是犹太人嘛  严格来说
<4-7,Howard>It's just, you know, I'm Jewish, and technically,

202
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:26,420
<4-7,Howard>安息日的时候我们得休息  不适合搬家
<4-7,Howard>we're not supposed to drive or carry anything on the Sabbath.

203
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,380
<4-7,Howard>怪神别怪我啊
<4-7,Howard>So this one's on God.

204
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,030
<4-8,Bernadette>要想赖神跟习俗可以
<4-8,Bernadette>That might be a little more convincing

205
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:34,590
<4-8,Bernadette>但你满嘴猪肉起司汉堡  谁信啊[犹太人不吃猪肉]
<4-8,Bernadette>if you didn't have a mouthful of bacon cheeseburger.

206
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,440
<4-9,Howard>我不是一个忠实信徒嘛
<4-9,Howard>My religion's kinda loosey-goosey.

207
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,510
<4-9,Howard>简单来说  只要乖乖牺牲包皮[割礼]
<4-9,Howard>Basically, as long as you got your schmekel clipped

208
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:41,540
<4-9,Howard>不戴十字架也没事啦
<4-9,Howard>and don't wear a cross, you're good.

209
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,470
<4-10,Bernadette>华仔  你答应过我会搬家的
<4-10,Bernadette>Howie, you promised you'd move.

210
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:46,550
<4-11,Howard>我会啊
<4-11,Howard>And I will.

211
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,270
<4-12,Penny>-谁信啊  -我真的会搬
<4-12,Penny>- Yeah, right. - I will.

212
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:50,510
<4-13,Howard>我怎么可能会一辈子都赖在
<4-13,Howard>I'm obviously not going to live in my mother's house

213
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:53,320
<4-13,Howard>我妈的家里不走呢  又不是小孩
<4-13,Howard>for the rest of my life. I'm not a child.

214
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,550
<4-14,Penny>我见过她帮你拍嗝
<4-14,Penny>I've seen her burp you.

215
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,720
<4-15,Howard>她不是帮我拍饱嗝
<4-15,Howard>She did not burp me.

216
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,780
<4-15,Howard>只是她拍我的背  我刚好打了个嗝
<4-15,Howard>She was patting me on the back, and I happened to burp.

217
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:07,990
<4-15,Howard>你不用去招待其他客人吗
<4-15,Howard>Don't you have other tables you should be waiting on?

218
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:10,930
<4-16,Penny>要啊  但我也说了  我是个烂服务员
<4-16,Penny>Yeah, but I told you, I'm not good at my job.

219
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,280
<4-16,Penny>伯纳黛特  相信我
<4-16,Penny>Bernadette, listen to me.

220
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,610
<4-16,Penny>他死也不会搬走
<4-16,Penny>He is never gonna leave.

221
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:15,190
<4-17,Bernadette>我开始觉得你是对的
<4-17,Bernadette>I'm starting to think you're right.

222
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,910
<4-18,Howard>好吧  我受够了
<4-18,Howard>All right, I've had enough of this.

223
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:19,470
<4-18,Howard>我是个成年人  我有成功的事业
<4-18,Howard>I'm a grown man, I have a successful career.

224
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,980
<4-18,Howard>看在上帝的份上  我还去过太空呢
<4-18,Howard>For the love of God, I've been to space!

225
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,680
<4-18,Howard>当我准备好时  我就会搬出去住
<4-18,Howard>I will move out when I'm ready,

226
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,150
<4-18,Howard>我不需要任何人没完没了地烦我
<4-18,Howard>and I don't need anyone badgering me into it!

227
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:28,930
<4-19,Penny>哎哟  我先告辞了
<4-19,Penny>Wow, excuse me.

228
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,010
<4-20,Howard>那话只是冲她说的
<4-20,Howard>That was just for her benefit.

229
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:34,310
<4-20,Howard>我明天就搬  我爱你  别离开我
<4-20,Howard>I'll move tomorrow. I love you. Don't leave me.

230
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:39,960
<5-1,Sheldon>艾米
<5-1,Sheldon>Amy.

231
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:41,770
<5-1,Sheldon>艾米
<5-1,Sheldon>Amy.

232
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,150
<5-1,Sheldon>愤怒的艾米
<5-1,Sheldon>Angry Amy.

233
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:47,690
<5-2,Amy>有何贵干
<5-2,Amy>What?

234
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:49,960
<5-3,Sheldon>我考虑了一下之前发生的事
<5-3,Sheldon>I've been thinking about what happened,

235
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,250
<5-3,Sheldon>我希望这个礼物
<5-3,Sheldon>and I hope this gift

236
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,090
<5-3,Sheldon>能让事态缓和点
<5-3,Sheldon>will make things better.

238
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,190
<5-4,Amy>我为何需要这个
<5-4,Amy>Why would I want this?

239
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:03,030
<5-5,Sheldon>首先  不客气
<5-5,Sheldon>First of all, you're welcome.

240
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:07,300
<5-5,Sheldon>再者  如果你不熟悉威尔·惠顿的作品
<5-5,Sheldon>Furthermore, not being familiar with Wil Wheaton's body of work

241
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,550
<5-5,Sheldon>你就不可能意识到
<5-5,Sheldon>there was no way for you to know

242
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:11,080
<5-5,Sheldon>你曾对这样的一位国家瑰宝出言不逊
<5-5,Sheldon>you were being rude to a national treasure.

243
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:15,180
<5-5,Sheldon>准备迎接130小时的"早知道就听你"的吧
<5-5,Sheldon>Get ready for 130 hours of "I told you so."

244
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,380
<5-5,Sheldon>好吧  由我来告诉你都演了些什么

250
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,820
<5-5,Sheldon>她要爱不释手了
<5-5,Sheldon>She's hooked.

251
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:54,250
<6-1,Raj>一个时代的终结啊
<6-1,Raj>An end of an era.

252
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:58,120
<6-2,Howard>唉  真希望这些墙能诉说衷肠
<6-2,Howard>Boy, if these walls could talk.

253
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,230
<6-3,Leonard>那这些墙会说"为何他这么喜欢自摸"
<6-3,Leonard>They'd say, "Why does he touch himself so much?"

254
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,800
<6-3,Leonard>是啊
<6-3,Leonard>Yeah.

255
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,760
<6-4,Howard>真不敢相信今后将不住这里了
<6-4,Howard>I can't believe I'm not going to live here anymore.

256
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:18,300
<6-4,Howard>这里一直都是我的卧室
<6-4,Howard>This has always been my bedroom.

257
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:21,600
<6-4,Howard>那里就是我妈以前测量我身高的地方
<6-4,Howard>Right here is where my mom used to mark my height.

258
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,300
<6-5,Leonard>真的哎
<6-5,Leonard>Oh, yeah.

264
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,480
<6-6,Howard>我还记得我五岁那年
<6-6,Howard>I remember when I was five,

265
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:38,450
<6-6,Howard>拿着我的万圣节糖果躲在这个桌子下面
<6-6,Howard>hiding under this desk with all my Halloween candy.

266
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:39,880
<6-6,Howard>吃了一些M&M花生糖豆
<6-6,Howard>Had some Peanut M&M'S,

267
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:43,080
<6-6,Howard>迎来了我第一次过敏性休克
<6-6,Howard>went into my first anaphylactic shock

268
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,250
<6-6,Howard>然后被送去医院
<6-6,Howard>and had to be rushed to the hospital.

269
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,200
<6-6,Howard>回到家后  吃花生士力架来欢庆康复
<6-6,Howard>Came home, celebrated with a Snickers,

270
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,750
<6-6,Howard>紧接着又迎来第二次过敏性休克
<6-6,Howard>went into my second anaphylactic shock.

271
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:54,410
<6-7,Raj>你什么时候发现对坚果过敏的
<6-7,Raj>When did you figure out you were allergic to nuts?

272
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:56,800
<6-8,Howard>大概在第三次吃杏仁巧克力时吧
<6-8,Howard>Sometime around the third Almond Joy.

273
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,120
<6-8,Howard>好吧
<6-8,Howard>Okay.

274
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,070
<6-9,Leonard>要开始把这些东西搬上货车吗
<6-9,Leonard>You want to start loading this stuff into the truck?

275
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:03,110
<6-10,Howard>好  搬吧
<6-10,Howard>Yeah, I guess.

276
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:05,140
<6-10,Howard>能帮我个忙吗
<6-10,Howard>Hey, would you do me a favor?

277
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,060
<6-10,Howard>你们先走
<6-10,Howard>Go on ahead.

278
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:10,680
<6-10,Howard>我只想在旧居里再独享这最后一刻
<6-10,Howard>I just want one last moment alone in my old room.

279
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,640
<6-11,Leonard>我们才不要站在搬家货车边上等着
<6-11,Leonard>We're not standing outside by the U-Haul

280
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,770
<6-11,Leonard>你在这自摸爽完一发
<6-11,Leonard>while you fondle yourself.

281
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,180
<6-12,Howard>好吧  一起走吧
<6-12,Howard>Fine, let's go.

282
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:28,300
<7-1,Penny>什么风把你吹来了
<7-1,Penny>What brings you in?

283
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,040
<7-2,Sheldon>佩妮  如果你不介意
<7-2,Sheldon>Penny, if you wouldn't mind,

284
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,370
<7-2,Sheldon>我想跟你谈谈女生
<7-2,Sheldon>I'd like to have a conversation about girls.

285
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,800
<7-3,Penny>我早预感到我们迟早会聊到的
<7-3,Penny>I had a feeling we'd have a talk like this sooner or later.

286
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,040
<7-3,Penny>你某个奇怪的地方终于长毛了吗
<7-3,Penny>Are you finally getting fuzz in weird places?

287
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,250
<7-3,Penny>佩妮  拜托
<7-3,Penny>Penny, please,

288
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,930
<7-4,Sheldon>我现在进退两难
<7-4,Sheldon>I'm on the horns of a relationship dilemma.

289
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:48,560
<7-4,Sheldon>同时声明  我到19岁那年
<7-4,Sheldon>And for the record, I had a full pubis of hair

290
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,590
<7-4,Sheldon>就已经长完了浓密的阴毛
<7-4,Sheldon>by the time I was 19.

291
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:53,570
<7-5,Penny>同时我也声明...
<7-5,Penny>And for the record...

292
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,510
<7-5,Penny>你打算喝点什么
<7-5,Penny>So what are you drinking?

293
00:13:58,510 --> 00:13:59,960
<7-6,Sheldon>今天超不顺
<7-6,Sheldon>Well, it's been a rough day.

294
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,580
<7-6,Sheldon>我通常喝甘菊茶
<7-6,Sheldon>I usually go chamomile tea,

295
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,480
<7-6,Sheldon>但我觉得喝那个没用了
<7-6,Sheldon>but I don't think that's going to cut it.

296
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,390
<7-7,Penny>你可以来一杯长岛冰茶呀
<7-7,Penny>You could have a Long Island Iced Tea.

297
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:12,050
<7-8,Sheldon>那个能舒缓我的神经吗
<7-8,Sheldon>Will that calm my nerves?

298
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:16,060
<7-9,Penny>好几次把我舒缓到裤子都"没了"
<7-9,Penny>It's calmed the pants off me a couple of times.

299
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,200
<7-10,Sheldon>来一杯
<7-10,Sheldon>Sold.

300
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,690
<7-11,Penny>你那巫师得来的心脏让你陷入麻烦了吗
<7-11,Penny>So, the heart you got from the wizard giving you trouble?

301
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:26,150
<7-12,Sheldon>问题不在我这  佩妮
<7-12,Sheldon>The trouble isn't with me, Penny,

302
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,690
<7-12,Sheldon>而在你们女人身上
<7-12,Sheldon>it's with your gender.

303
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:29,130
<7-12,Sheldon>总有一天  科学家们会发现
<7-12,Sheldon>Someday, scientists will discover

304
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:31,100
<7-12,Sheldon>女性的第二条X染色体除了胡说
<7-12,Sheldon>that second X chromosome contains nothing

305
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,230
<7-12,Sheldon>和废话之外  其他一无所有
<7-12,Sheldon>but nonsense and twaddle.

306
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,240
<7-13,Penny>是啊  艾米告诉我发生了什么事
<7-13,Penny>Yeah, Amy told me what happened.

307
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,480
<7-13,Penny>听着  道歉就行
<7-13,Penny>Look, just apologize.

308
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,150
<7-13,Penny>它会融解她的废话
<7-13,Penny>It'll warm her twaddle.

309
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,330
<7-14,Sheldon>那顶多治标不治本
<7-14,Sheldon>It's a band-aid at best.

310
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:46,100
<7-14,Sheldon>核心问题在于艾米和威尔互相讨厌
<7-14,Sheldon>The core problem is that Amy and Wil do not like each other.

311
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:49,830
<7-14,Sheldon>这点很莫名其妙  因为他们都为我痴狂
<7-14,Sheldon>Which is baffling because they're both crazy about me.

312
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:51,800
<7-14,Sheldon>我也喜欢他们俩
<7-14,Sheldon>And I like them,

313
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,360
<7-14,Sheldon>这表明他们是聪明人  并且还喜欢
<7-14,Sheldon>which indicates they're bright and interesting

314
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,530
<7-14,Sheldon>或曾演过《星际迷航》
<7-14,Sheldon>and/or were on Star Trek.

315
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,230
<7-15,Penny>亲爱的  你不能逼别人互相喜欢
<7-15,Penny>Honey, you can't make people like each other.

316
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:01,530
<7-15,Penny>非也
<7-15,Penny>Not true.

317
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,390
<7-16,Sheldon>莱纳德让我喜欢你
<7-16,Sheldon>Leonard made me like you.

318
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:05,780
<7-16,Sheldon>不瞒你说  这事可不容易啊
<7-16,Sheldon>And let me tell you, that was a hard row to hoe.

319
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,750
<7-16,Sheldon>干杯吧  姐们
<7-16,Sheldon>Cheers, pal.

320
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:16,610
<7-16,Sheldon>好家伙  这可真是一杯无与伦比的饮品
<7-16,Sheldon>Boy, that is a treat that's hard to beat.

321
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:21,020
<7-16,Sheldon>快让疯帽先生来吧  我要开个茶话会
<7-16,Sheldon>Get the Mad Hatter on the horn, I'm having a tea party.

323
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:28,620
<7-17,Penny>你或许该慢慢喝
<7-17,Penny>You might want to pace yourself.

324
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,430
<7-18,Sheldon>我常喝茶啦
<7-18,Sheldon>I drink tea all the time.

325
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,990
<7-18,Sheldon>我懂我在干嘛
<7-18,Sheldon>I think I know what I'm doing.

326
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,680
<7-19,Penny>我没资格批评一位长齐阴毛的人啊
<7-19,Penny>Far be it from me to criticize a man with a full pubis.

327
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:41,310
<7-19,Penny>谢尔顿  问题不在威尔·惠顿这  好吗
<7-19,Penny>Look, Sheldon, your problem is not Wil Wheaton, okay?

328
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:43,580
<7-19,Penny>你的问题在于你对待艾米的方式
<7-19,Penny>Your problem is the way you treated Amy.

329
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,550
<7-20,Sheldon>我的问题是我的茶喝光了
<7-20,Sheldon>My problem is I'm out of tea.

330
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,640
<7-21,Penny>拜托  有人对你女友出言不逊
<7-21,Penny>Come on, someone insulted your girlfriend

331
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,970
<7-21,Penny>你却听之任之
<7-21,Penny>and you just let him do it.

332
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:54,100
<7-21,Penny>我还以为德州爷们会为女友挺身而出呢
<7-21,Penny>I thought you Texas guys stood up for your womenfolk.

333
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,660
<7-22,Sheldon>得了吧  佩妮
<7-22,Sheldon>Penny, please,

334
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:59,030
<7-22,Sheldon>我可比头脑简单的乡野村夫有教养
<7-22,Sheldon>I think I've evolved beyond my simple rustic upbringing.

335
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:00,080
<7-23,Penny>抱歉
<7-23,Penny>Sorry.

336
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,380
<7-24,Sheldon>不过话说回来
<7-24,Sheldon>On the other hand,

337
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:04,190
<7-24,Sheldon>那个卑鄙小人敢对我女人口出狂言
<7-24,Sheldon>that low-down polecat done wronged my woman.

338
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:09,470
<7-25,Penny>"长岛"的酒劲上来了  德州仔
<7-25,Penny>Welcome to Long Island, Tex.

339
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,500
<7-26,Sheldon>艾米不应该被这样对待
<7-26,Sheldon>Amy deserves better.

340
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,680
<7-26,Sheldon>我们买绅士什锦果仁时
<7-26,Sheldon>You know, when we buy the Planter's deluxe mix,

341
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,570
<7-26,Sheldon>她会帮我先吃光巴西坚果
<7-26,Sheldon>she eats all the Brazil nuts

342
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:19,360
<7-26,Sheldon>这样我就不用看到它们
<7-26,Sheldon>so I don't have to look at them.

343
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:23,530
<7-26,Sheldon>她是独一无二的圣人与松鼠结合体
<7-26,Sheldon>She's a unique blend of saint and squirrel.

344
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,970
<7-27,Penny>对  她是的
<7-27,Penny>Yeah, that she is.

345
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:26,870
<7-27,Penny>给你
<7-27,Penny>Here you go.

346
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:28,990
<7-28,Sheldon>我无情麻木又自我
<7-28,Sheldon>I'm a callous egomaniac.

347
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:30,420
<7-28,Sheldon>她会离开我的
<7-28,Sheldon>She's gonna leave me.

348
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:31,580
<7-29,Penny>她不会的
<7-29,Penny>No, she won't.

349
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:33,600
<7-30,Sheldon>对  她不会的  我这么棒的男人
<7-30,Sheldon>No, she won't. I'm great.

350
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:47,410
<8-1,Howard>好了  现在
<8-1,Howard>Okay, I have now

351
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:50,120
<8-1,Howard>我正式搬出了我母亲大人的家
<8-1,Howard>officially moved out of my mother's house.

352
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,980
<8-1,Howard>现在我生活中唯一会在浴室
<8-1,Howard>You are now the only woman in my life

353
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,920
<8-1,Howard>撞见的裸女就剩你啦
<8-1,Howard>who I'll see naked in the bathroom.

354
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,760
<8-2,Bernadette>我知道这不容易
<8-2,Bernadette>I know this wasn't easy.

355
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,040
<8-2,Bernadette>你还好吗
<8-2,Bernadette>You doing okay?

356
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,240
<8-3,Howard>我没事
<8-3,Howard>Oh, I'm fine.

357
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,550
<8-3,Howard>我只是担心我妈
<8-3,Howard>It's just her I'm worried about.

358
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:03,090
<8-4,Bernadette>她不会有事的
<8-4,Bernadette>Aw, she'll be okay.

359
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:05,020
<8-4,Bernadette>-她是成年人  -我知道
<8-4,Bernadette>- She's a grown woman. - I know.

360
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:07,090
<8-5,Howard>只是我爸离开后
<8-5,Howard>It's just ever since my dad left,

361
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:09,620
<8-5,Howard>我就觉得  我对她有责任
<8-5,Howard>I've felt responsible for her.

362
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:12,160
<8-6,Bernadette>这对一个孩子来说责任太重了
<8-6,Bernadette>That's a lot for a kid to deal with.

363
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,290
<8-7,Howard>她总是很伤心
<8-7,Howard>She was just so sad all the time.

364
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:18,610
<8-7,Howard>我是唯一可以令她开心起来的人
<8-7,Howard>Yeah, I was the only person who could cheer her up.

365
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:21,100
<8-7,Howard>我还有"本与杰瑞"牌冰淇淋
<8-7,Howard>Well, me and Ben and Jerry.

366
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,020
<8-8,Bernadette>她很幸运能有你的陪伴
<8-8,Bernadette>She's lucky you were there.

367
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,870
<8-9,Howard>因为她  我才学魔术的
<8-9,Howard>You know, she's why I first got into magic.

368
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:31,130
<8-9,Howard>我会表演给她看
<8-9,Howard>I would do little shows for her,

369
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:34,750
<8-9,Howard>挂上床单  好像幕布一样
<8-9,Howard>hang up a bedsheet like it was a curtain,

370
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,630
<8-9,Howard>戴上礼帽  穿上披风
<8-9,Howard>put on a top hat and cape.

371
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:38,740
<8-9,Howard>表演中
<8-9,Howard>And part way through the act,

372
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:42,420
<8-9,Howard>我会说我需要从观众中请一位志愿者
<8-9,Howard>I would say I needed a volunteer from the audience

373
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:45,220
<8-9,Howard>做我美丽的助手
<8-9,Howard>to be my beautiful assistant

374
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:47,990
<8-9,Howard>邀请她上台
<8-9,Howard>and invite her up on stage.

375
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:51,730
<8-9,Howard>我依然记得她当时笑的样子
<8-9,Howard>I can still remember the way she'd smile.

376
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:54,330
<8-9,Howard>在那短暂的几分钟里  她...
<8-9,Howard>For a few minutes, she'd...

377
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:57,400
<8-9,Howard>忘了自己有多孤单
<8-9,Howard>forget how lonely she was.

378
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,550
<8-10,Bernadette>见鬼  走吧
<8-10,Bernadette>Aw, crap. Let's go.

00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,730
<8-14,Bernadette>在你告诉我那个
<8-14,Bernadette>Well, you should've thought of that

384
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:14,170
<8-14,Bernadette>傻逼催泪魔术故事前就该想到这点了
<8-14,Bernadette>before you told me the stupid magic trick story.

<8-15,Howard>我们不能谈谈吗
