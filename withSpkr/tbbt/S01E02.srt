1
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:05,590
<1-1,Leonard>给  泰国炒面  不加花生
<1-1,Leonard>Here we go. pad thai,no peanuts.

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:06,970
<1-2,Howard>里面有花生油吗
<1-2,Howard>But does it have peanut oil?

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:08,360
<1-3,Leonard>我不太清楚
<1-3,Leonard>I'm not sure.

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:11,270
<1-3,Leonard>大家都盯着点霍华德以防他肿起来
<1-3,Leonard>Everyone keep an eye on howard in case he starts to swell up.

5
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:15,690
<1-4,Sheldon>既然现在没蜜蜂出没  你可以用我的肾上腺素
<1-4,Sheldon>Since it's not bee season,you can have my epinephrine.

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,720
<1-5,Raj>-有筷子吗  -不需要  这是泰国菜
<1-5,Raj>-are there any chopsticks. -no need. this is thai food.

7
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:20,050
<1-7,Leonard>开始了
<1-7,Leonard>Here we go.

8
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:23,020
<1-8,Sheldon>泰国在19世纪后半期才有叉子
<1-8,Sheldon>Thailand has had the fork since the latter half of the 19th century.

9
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:25,440
<1-8,Sheldon>有趣的是他们不直接把叉子放在嘴里
<1-8,Sheldon>Interestingly  they don't put the fork in their mouth--

10
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:28,780
<1-8,Sheldon>而是用叉子来把食物放在勺子里然后用勺子放到嘴里
<1-8,Sheldon>They use it to put the food on a spoon which then goes into their mouth.

11
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,810
<1-9,Leonard>跟他要个餐巾  我量你也不敢
<1-9,Leonard>Ask him for a napkin. I dare you.

12
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:34,970
<1-9,Leonard>我去开
<1-9,Leonard>I'll get it.

13
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,260
<1-10,Howard>我脸肿了吗  我觉得我脸肿了
<1-10,Howard>Do I look puffy? I feel puffy.

14
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:40,620
<1-12,Leonard>-嘿  里奥纳德  -嘿  潘妮
<1-12,Leonard>-hey,leonard. -oh,hi,penny.

15
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,740
<1-13,Penny>-我有打扰吗  -没有
<1-13,Penny>-am I interrupting? -no.

16
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,160
<1-15,Sheldon (off)>霍华德  你没肿
<1-15,Sheldon (off)>you're not swelling,howard.

17
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:46,100
<1-16,Howard (off)>看看我的手指  他们看起来象维也纳香肠
<1-16,Howard (off)>Look at my fingers. they're like vienna sausages.

18
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,440
<1-17,Penny>-听起来你好象有客人  -他们总在
<1-17,Penny>-sounds like you have company. -they're not going anywhere.

19
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,450
<1-18,Leonard>你下班了  太好了  工作怎么样
<1-18,Leonard>So,you're coming home from work. that's great. how was work?

20
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,370
<1-19,Penny>那是卖芝士蛋糕的
<1-19,Penny>You know,it's a cheesecake factory.

21
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:57,320
<1-19,Penny>客人点芝士蛋糕  我给他们端过去
<1-19,Penny>People order cheesecake and I bring it to them.

22
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:02,420
<1-20,Leonard>这和碳水化合物传送系统有点象
<1-20,Leonard>So you kind of act like a carbohydrate delivery system.

23
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,800
<1-21,Penny>是  随便你怎么叫  反正拿的工资最低
<1-21,Penny>Yeah. call it whatever you want,I get minimum wage.

24
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,470
<1-21,Penny>我想问一下你能不能帮我点忙...
<1-21,Penny>I was wondering if you could help me out with something.

25
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,480
<1-22,Leonard>好的
<1-22,Leonard>yes.

26
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,970
<1-23,Penny>好的  明天会有人给我送家具
<1-23,Penny>Great. I'm having some furniture delivered tomorrow

27
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:17,450
<1-23,Penny>我可能不在  所以...
<1-23,Penny>and I may not be here,so...

28
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,640
<1-25,Penny>好啊
<1-25,Penny>Hello.

29
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:27,750
<1-26,Howard>-什么  -有没有人用优美的俄语跟你说过
<1-26,Howard>-i'm sorry? -haven't you ever been told

30
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,030
<1-26,Howard>你是多么的漂亮吗
<1-26,Howard>How beautiful you are in flawless russian?

31
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:30,640
<1-27,Penny>没有
<1-27,Penny>No,I haven't.

32
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:31,820
<1-28,Howard>你会习惯的
<1-28,Howard>Get used to it.

33
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,540
<1-29,Penny>我可能不会
<1-29,Penny>Yeah. I probably won't.

34
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,870
<1-29,Penny>-嘿  谢尔顿  -嘿
<1-29,Penny>-hey,sheldon. -hi.

35
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,110
<1-31,Penny>嘿  拉杰
<1-31,Penny>Hey,raj.

36
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,810
<1-31,Penny>还是不跟我说话
<1-31,Penny>Still not talking to me,huh?

37
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:44,100
<1-32,Sheldon>他不是故意和你过不去  这是他的老毛病了
<1-32,Sheldon>Don't take it personally,it's his pathology.

38
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:45,490
<1-32,Sheldon>他不能跟女人说话
<1-32,Sheldon>He can't talk to women.

39
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,810
<1-33,Howard>他不能跟漂亮女人说话
<1-33,Howard>He can't talk to atractive woman,or in your case,

40
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,110
<1-33,Howard>或者就是象你这样有迷人芝士蛋糕味的女神
<1-33,Howard>A cheesecake-scented goddess.

41
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:52,780
<1-34,Leonard>明天会有人来送家具?
<1-34,Leonard>So there's gonna be some furniture delivered?

42
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,000
<1-35,Penny>是的  如果送来的时候我不在
<1-35,Penny>Yeah. If it gets here and I'm not here,could you sign

43
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:56,830
<1-35,Penny>你能帮我签收一下然后放到我房间吗
<1-35,Penny>And have them put it in my apartment?

44
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,060
<1-36,Leonard>没问题
<1-36,Leonard>No problem.

45
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:00,130
<1-37,Penny>太好了  这是备用钥匙  谢谢
<1-37,Penny>Great. here's my spare key. thank you.

46
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,550
<1-38,Leonard>潘妮  等等
<1-38,Leonard>Penny,wait.

47
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:08,300
<1-40,Leonard>如果你没什么安排的话
<1-40,Leonard>If you don't have any other plans,do you want to join us

48
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:12,050
<1-40,Leonard>你想一起吃点泰国菜看个超人电影马拉松吗
<1-40,Leonard>For thai food and a superman movie marathon?

49
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:15,270
<1-41,Penny>马拉松?  到底有多少部超人电影啊
<1-41,Penny>A marathon? how many superman movies are there?

50
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,010
<1-42,Sheldon>你是开玩笑的  对不对
<1-42,Sheldon>You're kidding,right?

51
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:21,000
<1-43,Penny>我比较喜欢露易丝·莱恩从飞机上掉下来
<1-43,Penny>I do like the one where lois lane falls from the helicopter

52
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,640
<1-43,Penny>超人俯冲下去接住她的那部  那是第几部
<1-43,Penny>And superman swooshes down and catches her. which one was that?

53
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,140
<1-44,Leonard,Sheldon and Howard together>第一部
<1-44,Leonard,Sheldon and Howard together>One.

54
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:28,750
<1-45,Sheldon>你知道那个场景完全不符合科学吧
<1-45,Sheldon>You realize that scene was rife with scientific inaccuracy.

55
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,970
<1-46,Penny>是的  我知道  人不能飞
<1-46,Penny>Yes,I know,men can't fly.

56
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,670
<1-47,Sheldon>不  不  假设人能飞
<1-47,Sheldon>No. let's assume that they can.

57
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:35,620
<1-47,Sheldon>露易丝·莱恩从高空往下掉
<1-47,Sheldon>Lois lane is falling,

58
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,410
<1-47,Sheldon>以每秒32英尺的初速度做自由落体加速
<1-47,Sheldon>Accelerating at an initial rate of 32 feet per second per second.

59
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:41,610
<1-47,Sheldon>超人俯冲下来用两个钢筋一样的手臂想要接住她
<1-47,Sheldon>Superman swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel.

60
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:45,250
<1-47,Sheldon>此时莱恩小姐在以每小时120公里的速度往下掉
<1-47,Sheldon>Miss lane,who is now traveling At approximately 120 miles an hour

61
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:48,340
<1-47,Sheldon>碰到钢筋手臂  立马被劈成三半
<1-47,Sheldon>Hits them and is immediately sliced into three equal pieces.

62
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:53,880
<1-48,Leonard>但是如果超人也达到那个速度然后减速
<1-48,Leonard>Unless superman matches her speed and decelerates.

63
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,340
<1-49,Sheldon>还有时间吗  先生  她离地面两尺高
<1-49,Sheldon>In what space,sir? she's two feet above the ground.

64
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:00,670
<1-49,Sheldon>如果他真的爱她的话  他应该让她掉在马路上
<1-49,Sheldon>Frankly,if he really loved her,he'd let her hit the pavement.

65
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,230
<1-49,Sheldon>那还比较仁慈
<1-49,Sheldon>It'd be a more merciful death.

66
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:07,170
<1-50,Leonard>你的全部论证都是建立在
<1-50,Leonard>Excuse me,your entire argument is predicated on the assumption

67
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,470
<1-50,Leonard>超人的飞行有惊人的冲击力的基础上
<1-50,Leonard>That superman's flight is a feat of strength.

68
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,780
<1-51,Sheldon>听到你自己说的了么
<1-51,Sheldon>Are you listening to yourself? it is well established

69
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:13,460
<1-50,Leonard>很明显他的飞行有无限的冲击力
<1-50,Leonard>That his flight is a feat of strength.

70
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,860
<1-51,Sheldon>这是他能跃过大厦的能力的延伸
<1-51,Sheldon>It is an extension of his ability to leap tall buildings,

71
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:18,430
<1-51,Sheldon>也是吸收来自太阳的能力
<1-51,Sheldon>An ability he derives from exposure to earth's yellow sun.

72
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,260
<1-52,Howard>那他晚上怎么也能飞
<1-52,Howard>And how does he fly at night?

73
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:22,720
<1-53,Sheldon>月亮反射的太阳光
<1-53,Sheldon>A combination of the moon's solar reflection

74
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,420
<1-53,Sheldon>结合氪星球皮肤细胞储存的能量
<1-53,Sheldon>And the energy-storage capacity of kryptonian skin cells.

75
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,660
<1-54,Penny>我去洗澡了
<1-54,Penny>I'm just gonna go wash up.

76
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:32,140
<1-55,Leonard>我有2600本漫画  我打赌
<1-55,Leonard>I have 2,600 comic books in there. I challenge you

77
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:34,610
<1-55,Leonard>你找不到任何有关氪星球皮肤细胞的线索
<1-55,Leonard>To find a single reference to kryptonian skin cells.

78
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,000
<1-56,Sheldon>接受挑战
<1-56,Sheldon>Challenge accepted.

79
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:41,320
<1-56,Sheldon>我们被锁在外面了
<1-56,Sheldon>We're locked out.

80
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:43,710
<1-57,Raj>还有  那个美女走了
<1-57,Raj>Also,the pretty girl left.

86
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:12,810
<2-1,Leonard>她的公寓在四楼但是电梯坏了所以你得...
<2-1,Leonard>ok.Her apartment's on the fourth floor but the elevator's broken,so...

87
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,350
<2-1,Leonard>你就那么走了?  好的  谢谢
<2-1,Leonard>You're just gonna be done? okay. cool. thanks

88
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,480
<2-1,Leonard>那我们就自己搬上去
<2-1,Leonard>We'll just bring it up ourselves.

89
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,010
<2-2,Sheldon>我非常不同意
<2-2,Sheldon>I hardly think so.

90
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,440
<2-3,Leonard>为什么
<2-3,Leonard>Why not?

91
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,550
<2-4,Sheldon>我们没有手推车
<2-4,Sheldon>Well,we don't have a dolly,

92
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:28,180
<2-4,Sheldon>也没有吊装带或者胸大肌
<2-4,Sheldon>Or lifting belts or any measurable upper-body strength.

93
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:31,370
<2-5,Leonard>我们不需要力气  我们是物理学家
<2-5,Leonard>We don't need strength--we're physicists.

94
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:34,140
<2-5,Leonard>我们是阿基米德的传人
<2-5,Leonard>We are the intellectual descendants of archimedes.

95
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,520
<2-5,Leonard>给我一个支点  我可以撬动地球
<2-5,Leonard>Give me a fulcrum and a lever and I can move the earth.

96
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:38,530
<2-5,Leonard>只需要...  我弄不动  我弄不动
<2-5,Leonard>It's just a matter of... I don't have this.

97
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:42,090
<2-6,Sheldon>阿基米德肯定非常自豪
<2-6,Sheldon>Archimedes would be so proud.

98
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,420
<2-7,Leonard>你有什么主意吗
<2-7,Leonard>Do you have any ideas?

99
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:53,750
<2-8,Sheldon>是的  但都需要绿灯侠和魔戒
<2-8,Sheldon>Yes,but they all involve a green lantern and a power ring.

100
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,140
<2-9,Leonard>-慢点  -慢点
<2-9,Leonard>Easy... easy.

101
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,140
<2-9,Leonard>好的
<2-9,Leonard>Ok.

102
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:06,160
<2-9,Leonard>现在有了个斜面
<2-9,Leonard>Now we've got an inclined plane. the force required to lift

103
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:08,390
<2-9,Leonard>拉力由于楼梯的正弦角而减少了...
<2-9,Leonard>Is reduced by the sine of the angle of the stairs,

104
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,100
<2-9,Leonard>角度大约是30度  那就减少了差不多一半
<2-9,Leonard>Call it 30 degrees,so,about half.

105
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:11,870
<2-10,Sheldon>正好一半
<2-10,Sheldon>Exactly half.

106
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,100
<2-10,Sheldon>正好一半
<2-10,Sheldon>Exactly half.

107
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:17,810
<2-11,Leonard (snarkily)>推吧
<2-11,Leonard (snarkily)>Let's push.

108
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:23,760
<2-11,Leonard (snarkily)>看  动了  很简单
<2-11,Leonard (snarkily)>See,it's moving,this is easy.

109
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:25,640
<2-11,Leonard (snarkily)>数学里都证明了
<2-11,Leonard (snarkily)>It's all in the math.

110
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,020
<2-12,Sheldon>-转角的公式是什么  -什么
<2-12,Sheldon>-what's your formula for the corner? -what?

111
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:36,600
<2-12,Sheldon>好的  没问题
<2-12,Sheldon>Okay,no problem.

112
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,620
<2-13,Leonard>上来  帮我拉上来然后拐弯
<2-13,Leonard>Just come up here,help me pull and turn.

113
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:46,040
<2-14,Sheldon>重力  太没良心了
<2-14,Sheldon>Ah,gravity,thou art a heartless bitch.

114
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,960
<2-15,Sheldon>你知道我们花这么大的力气
<2-15,Sheldon>You do understand that our efforts here will in no way increase the odds

115
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:54,060
<2-15,Sheldon>一点也不会增加你和这个女人性交的几率
<2-15,Sheldon>Of you having sexual congress with this woman.

116
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,830
<2-16,Leonard>男人为女人做事不是为了做爱
<2-16,Leonard>Men do things for women without expecting sex.

117
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,070
<2-17,Sheldon>那是刚做完爱的男人
<2-17,Sheldon>Those would be men who just had sex.

118
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,750
<2-18,Leonard>我这么做是为了做个好邻居
<2-18,Leonard>I'm doing this to be a good neighbor.

119
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:07,180
<2-18,Leonard>再说也不会减少几率
<2-18,Leonard>In any case,there's no way it could lower the odds.

128
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,480
<4-4,Leonard>潘妮这也就是有一点点乱
<4-4,Leonard>So penny's a little messy.

129
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:35,200
<4-4,Leonard>一点点乱?
<4-4,Leonard>A little messy?

130

<4-5,Sheldon>曼德尔布罗特集合才叫一点点乱
<4-5,Sheldon>The mandelbrot set of complex numbers is a little messy.

131
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,660
<4-5,Sheldon>这完全是一塌糊涂
<4-5,Sheldon>This is chaos.

132
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:41,390
<4-5,Sheldon>问一下
<4-5,Sheldon>Excuse me.

<4-5,Sheldon>跟我解释下托盘餐具放在沙发上
<4-5,Sheldon>Explain to me an organizational system

134
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,750
<4-5,Sheldon>这算哪门子组织系统
<4-5,Sheldon>Where a tray of flatware on a couch is valid.

135
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,540
<4-5,Sheldon>我刚才有提到过这是沙发
<4-5,Sheldon>I'm just inferring this is a couch

136
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:50,570
<4-5,Sheldon>因为证据表明咖啡桌上
<4-5,Sheldon>Because the evidence suggests the coffee table

00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,110
<4-5,Sheldon>正在举办小型二手货贩卖
<4-5,Sheldon>Is having a tiny garage sale.

138
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:55,840
<4-6,Leonard>你有没有想过并不是世界上所有的人
<4-6,Leonard>Did it ever occur to you that not everyone has

139
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:58,200
<4-6,Leonard>都有那种强迫症
<4-6,Leonard>The compulsive need to sort,organize and label

140

<4-6,Leonard>要把身边的东西都按顺序排好贴上标签?
<4-6,Leonard>The entire world around them?

142
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,290
<4-8,Leonard>他们不是那样的
<4-8,Leonard>Well,they don't.

143
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:06,250
<4-8,Leonard>你可能不太相信
<4-8,Leonard>Hard as it may be for you to believe,

<4-8,Leonard>大多数人不会把早餐麦片按纤维含量的顺序排列

145
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,910
<4-9,Sheldon>但是我相信我们都觉察到那有时候很管用
<4-9,Sheldon>Excuse me,but I think we've both found that helpful at times.

146
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,410
<4-10,Leonard>-快点  该走了  -等等
<4-10,Leonard>-come on,we should go. -hang on.

<4-14,Leonard>This is not your home.

149
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,400
<4-15,Sheldon>这谁的家都不是  这是一团乱熵(熵越大  系统越无序)
<4-15,Sheldon>This is not anyone's home. this is a swirling vortex of entropy.

150
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:34,750
<4-16,Leonard>当那个异性装扮癖者住在这的时候你可没关心他怎么布置的这个地方
<4-16,Leonard>When the transvestite lived here,you didn't care how he kept the place.

151
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,430
<4-17,Sheldon>那是因为太完美无暇了
<4-17,Sheldon>Because it was immaculate.

152

<4-17,Sheldon>你打开那个男人的衣柜
<4-17,Sheldon>I mean,you opened that man's closet,

00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,890
<4-18,Leonard>你开他的衣柜干吗
<4-18,Leonard>What were you doing in his closet?

<4-19,Sheldon>我帮他拉电缆装网络摄象头
<4-19,Sheldon>I helped him run some cable for a web cam.

176
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:23,180
<5-1,Leonard>你疯了吗
<5-1,Leonard>Are you insane?

177
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,170
<5-1,Leonard>你不能在半夜
<5-1,Leonard>You can't just break into a woman's apartment

178
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,920
<7-1,Leonard>闯进一个女人的公寓  打扫
<7-1,Leonard>In the middle of the night and clean.

179
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,590
<7-2,Sheldon>我别无选择  我睡不着
<7-2,Sheldon>I had no choice. I couldn't sleep knowing

180
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,730
<7-3,Leonard>想到在我卧室外面是我们的客厅
<7-3,Leonard>That just outside my bedroom was our living room,

181
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:33,970
<7-4,Sheldon>在我们客厅外面是走廊
<7-4,Sheldon>And just outside our living room was that hallway,

182
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:36,940
<7-4,Sheldon>和走廊这边就是...这个样子
<7-4,Sheldon>And immediately adjacent to the hallway was... this.

183
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:41,020
<7-5,Leonard>你有没有意识到如果潘妮醒过来
<7-5,Leonard>Do you realize that if penny wakes up,

184
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:43,990
<7-5,Leonard>我们根本无法合理的解释为什么在这
<7-5,Leonard>There is no reasonable explanation as to why we're here.

185
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:46,730
<7-6,Sheldon>我刚给了个你合理的解释
<7-6,Sheldon>I just gave you a reasonable explanation.

186
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,860
<7-7,Leonard>没  没  你只是给了个解释
<7-7,Leonard>No,no,you gave me an explanation.

187
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,300
<7-7,Leonard>它的合理性要由你的陪审团来决定
<7-7,Leonard>Its reasonableness will be determined by a jury of your peers.

188
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,610
<7-8,Sheldon>搞笑  我哪来的陪审团
<7-8,Sheldon>Don't be ridiculous. I have no peers.

189
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,030
<7-9,Leonard>我们得赶快离开这
<7-9,Leonard>We have to get out of here.

190
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:04,840
<7-10,Sheldon>你应该用低音区说话
<7-10,Sheldon>You might want to speak in a lower register.

<7-11,Leonard>什么

00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:10,600
<7-12,Sheldon>对高音区的噪音非常敏感
<7-12,Sheldon>To high-pitched noises while they sleep

194
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,780
<7-12,Sheldon>所以她们才能在婴儿哭的时候醒来
<7-12,Sheldon>So that they'll be roused by a crying baby.

195
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,470
<7-12,Sheldon>如果你不想吵醒她
<7-12,Sheldon>If you want to avoid waking her,

196
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:16,360
<7-12,Sheldon>就用低音区说话
<7-12,Sheldon>Speak in a lower register.

197
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,600
<7-13,Leonard>那太荒谬了
<7-13,Leonard>That's ridiculous!

<7-13,Leonard>不对

<8-3,Sheldon>虽然时间不长但是睡眠质量很好
<8-3,Sheldon>Granted,not long,but just deeply and well.

209
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:10,110
<8-4,Leonard>我一点也不感到奇怪
<8-4,Leonard>I'm not surprised.

210

<8-6,Leonard>You think?

214
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:22,050
<8-7,Sheldon>就算是吧  我的方法可能有点唐突
<8-7,Sheldon>Granted,my methods may have been somewhat unorthodox,

215
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:25,000
<8-7,Sheldon>但是我认为这能很好的提高潘妮的生活质量
<8-7,Sheldon>But I think the end result will be a measurable enhancement

00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:27,520
<8-7,Sheldon>你说的对
<8-7,Sheldon>-to penny's quality of life -you've convinced me.

<8-24,Sheldon>Really more to organize. you're not actually dirty,per se.

238
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:26,320
<8-25,Penny>把钥匙还给我
<8-25,Penny>Give me back my key.

239
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:29,010
<8-26,Leonard>我非常抱歉
<8-26,Leonard>I'm very,very sorry.

240
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:31,100
<8-27,Penny>你知道这有多么的恐怖吗
<8-27,Penny>Do you understand how creepy this is?

241
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,460
<8-28,Leonard>是的  我们昨晚讨论了好久
<8-28,Leonard>Oh,yes,we discussed it at length last night.

242
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:36,080
<8-29,Penny>在我的房间  在我睡觉的时候
<8-29,Penny>In my apartment,while I was sleeping?!

243
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:39,360
<8-30,Sheldon>还有打呼  可能是有点鼻窦感染
<8-30,Sheldon>And snoring. and that's probably just a sinus infection.

244
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,030
<8-30,Sheldon>但也有可能是睡眠呼吸暂停综合症
<8-30,Sheldon>But it could be sleep apnea.

245
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,140
<8-30,Sheldon>你可能需要看一下耳鼻喉科医师
<8-30,Sheldon>You might want to see an otolaryngologist.

246
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,080
<8-30,Sheldon>喉科医生
<8-30,Sheldon>A throat doctor.

247
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:51,720
<8-31,Penny>哪种医生能把鞋从屁股上取下来
<8-31,Penny>And what kind of doctor removes shoes from asses?

248
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,190
<8-32,Sheldon>那要取决于深度
<8-32,Sheldon>Depending on the depth,

249
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:57,010
<8-32,Sheldon>要么是...直肠科医师
<8-32,Sheldon>That's either a... proctologist

250
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,670
<8-32,Sheldon>要么是外科医生
<8-32,Sheldon>Or a general surgeon.

251
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,070
<8-32,Sheldon>讽刺
<8-32,Sheldon>sacasm

252
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,070
<8-33,Penny>天啊
<8-33,Penny>god

253
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:11,440
<8-34,Leonard>潘妮  我认为你现在的感觉非常正常
<8-34,Leonard>penny I think what you're feeling

254
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,540
<8-34,Leonard>也许等你没这么感觉...
<8-34,Leonard>Is perfectly valid and maybe a little bit later

255
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:16,770
<8-34,Leonard>因为没别的词了  被侵犯
<8-34,Leonard>When you're feeling a little less... for lack of a better word--violated,

256
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,530
<8-34,Leonard>我们可以好好谈一下
<8-34,Leonard>Maybe we can talk about this some more.

257
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:20,970
<8-35,Penny>-离我远点  -好的  那是另一个办法
<8-35,Penny>-stay away from me. -sure,that's another way to go.

258
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,390
<8-36,Leonard>潘妮  潘妮  等等
<8-36,Leonard>Penny,penny! hold on

259
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,070
<8-37,Sheldon>先声明
<8-37,Sheldon>Just to clarify,

260
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:27,690
<8-37,Sheldon>因为你走后我们肯定会讨论
<8-37,Sheldon>Because there will be a discussion when you leave,

261
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:31,040
<8-37,Sheldon>你是只对我们在你睡觉的时候
<8-37,Sheldon>Is your objection solely to our presence

262
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,970
<8-37,Sheldon>进入你的房间反感呢
<8-37,Sheldon>In the apartment while you were sleeping,

263
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:37,470
<8-37,Sheldon>还是你对我们强加的整理体系也感到反感?
<8-37,Sheldon>Or do you also object to the imposition of a new organizational paradigm.

264
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,990
<8-37,Sheldon>那可真有点呆若木鸡啊
<8-37,Sheldon>Well,that was a little non-responsive.

265
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:49,650
<8-38,Leonard>你现在马上把自己送过去道歉
<8-38,Leonard>You are going to march yourself over there right now and apologize.

266
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:55,750
<8-38,Leonard>有什么好笑的
<8-38,Leonard>What's funny?

267
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:57,780
<8-39,Sheldon>那不是讽刺吗
<8-39,Sheldon>That wasn't sarcasm?

268
00:13:58,050 --> 00:13:59,780
<8-40,Leonard>不是
<8-40,Leonard>No

269
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:03,150
<8-41,Sheldon>天啊  你今天真是一塌糊涂
<8-41,Sheldon>Boy,you are all over the place this morning.

270
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:09,930
<8-41,Sheldon>我有一个硕士两个博士  我不应该做这个
<8-41,Sheldon>I have a master's and two ph.d.s,I should not have to do this.

271
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,280
<8-42,Penny (opening door)>干吗
<8-42,Penny (opening door)>What?!

272
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,170
<8-43,Sheldon>我为昨晚的事感到非常抱歉
<8-43,Sheldon>I am truly sorry for what happened last night.

273
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,860
<8-43,Sheldon>责任全在我
<8-43,Sheldon>I take full responsibility.

274
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:19,840
<8-43,Sheldon>我希望这不会影响你对里奥纳德的看法
<8-43,Sheldon>And I hope that it won't color your opinion of leonard,

275
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:23,550
<8-43,Sheldon>他不仅是个非常好的人而且我还听说
<8-43,Sheldon>Who is not only a wonderful guy,but also,I hear,

276
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,490
<8-43,Sheldon>是个非常完美的情人
<8-43,Sheldon>A gentle and thorough lover.

277
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,580
<8-43,Sheldon>我能做的都做了
<8-43,Sheldon>I did what I could.

278
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,380
<8-43,Sheldon>嘿  拉杰
<8-43,Sheldon>Hey,raj.

279
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:51,850
<9-1,Penny>嘿
<9-1,Penny>Hey,listen.

280
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:54,730
<9-1,Penny>我不知道你听说昨晚里奥纳德和谢尔顿干的事了没有
<9-1,Penny>I don't know if you heard about what happened last night.

281
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,310
<9-1,Penny>但是我感到非常气愤
<9-1,Penny>But I'm really upset about it.

282
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:58,640
<9-1,Penny>他们不请自入的进了我的房间
<9-1,Penny>I mean,they just... they let themselves into my place

283
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:01,020
<9-1,Penny>然后他们把房子打扫了一遍  你相信吗
<9-1,Penny>And then they cleaned it. can you even believe that?

284
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,360
<9-1,Penny>太诡异了
<9-1,Penny>How weird is that?

285
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:04,450
<9-2,Raj (internally, while Penny continues to talk)>她离我好近
<9-2,Raj (internally, while Penny continues to talk)>She's standing very close to me.

286
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:07,530
<9-2,Raj (internally, while Penny continues to talk)>她闻起来真香
<9-2,Raj (internally, while Penny continues to talk)>Oh,my,she does smell good.

287
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,730
<9-2,Raj (internally, while Penny continues to talk)>是什么  香草味的吗
<9-2,Raj (internally, while Penny continues to talk)>What is that,vanilla?

288
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:12,230
<9-3,Penny>在我们那
<9-3,Penny>You know,where I come from,

289
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:15,360
<9-3,Penny>如果有人晚上闯入你的家  你可以开枪  知道吗
<9-3,Penny>If someone comes into your house at night,you shoot. okay?

290
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:16,850
<9-3,Penny>不仅仅是打伤
<9-3,Penny>And you don't shoot to wound.

291
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,860
<9-3,Penny>我妹妹对她老公开了次枪
<9-3,Penny>I mean,all right,my sister shot her husband,

292
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,740
<9-3,Penny>但是那是次意外  他们都喝醉了
<9-3,Penny>But it was an accident,they were drunk.

293
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:23,160
<9-3,Penny>我在说什么来着
<9-3,Penny>Wait,what was I saying?

294
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,490
<9-4,Raj (internally)>她可真罗嗦啊
<9-4,Raj (internally)>She's so chatty.

295
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:30,360
<9-4,Raj (internally)>也许我父母是对的  我应该找个印度女孩
<9-4,Raj (internally)>maybe my parents are right. Maybe I'd be better off with an indian girl.

296
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:32,190
<9-4,Raj (internally)>我们有相同的文化背景
<9-4,Raj (internally)>We'd have the same cultural background

297
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:35,370
<9-4,Raj (internally)>我老婆就可以给我孩子唱
<9-4,Raj (internally)>And my wife could sing to my children the same lullabies my mother sang

298
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:35,740
<9-4,Raj (internally)>我妈妈经常给我唱的那首摇篮曲
<9-4,Raj (internally)>To me.

299
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,830
<9-5,Penny>虽然他们是好意  但是我...
<9-5,Penny>It's obvious that they meant well,but...

300
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:40,730
<9-5,Penny>我现在过的很不好  我说过我和我男朋友分手了
<9-5,Penny>I'm having a really rough time. like i said I broke up with my boyfriend

301
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:42,410
<9-5,Penny>我有点乱了阵脚
<9-5,Penny>And...

302
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:50,600
<9-6,Penny>虽然我认识的大部分男人都是混蛋
<9-6,Penny>i mean Just because most of the men I've known in my life happen to be jerks,

303
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:53,580
<9-6,Penny>并不意味着里奥纳德和谢尔顿也是
<9-6,Penny>Doesn't mean I should just assume leonard and sheldon are.

304
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:54,840
<9-6,Penny>是吧
<9-6,Penny>Right?

305
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:57,800
<9-7,Raj (internally)>她问了我个问题  我或许应该点头
<9-7,Raj (internally)>She asked me a question. I should probably nod.

306
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,780
<9-8,Penny>我也是这么想的
<9-8,Penny>That's exactly what I thought.

307
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:04,180
<9-8,Penny>谢谢你的倾听  你太可爱了
<9-8,Penny>Thank you for listening. you're a doll.

308
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,000
<9-9,Raj (internally)>转动胯部
<9-9,Raj (internally)>Turn your pelvis.

309
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:24,240
<10-1,Howard (jumping off game mat)>拿张餐巾吧  兄弟  你刚被伺候了
<10-1,Howard (jumping off game mat)>Grab a napkin,homie. you just got served.

310
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,930
<10-2,Leonard>算了  你赢了
<10-2,Leonard>It's fine.you win.

311
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:31,880
<10-3,Howard>他怎么了
<10-3,Howard>What's his problem?

312
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:34,570
<10-4,Sheldon>他的假想女朋友和他分手了
<10-4,Sheldon>His imaginary girlfriend broke up with him.

313
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:37,570
<10-5,Howard>经历过
<10-5,Howard>Been there.

314
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:42,430
<10-6,Raj (entering)>抱歉我现在才来
<10-6,Raj (entering)>Hello. Sorry I'm late,

315
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:44,850
<10-6,Raj (entering)>但是我在走廊里和潘妮聊天来着
<10-6,Raj (entering)>But I was in the hallway,chatting up penny.

316
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:48,850
<10-7,Howard>真的假的  你拉杰·库萨帕里和潘妮说话了?
<10-7,Howard>Really? you,rajesh koothrappali,spoke to penny?

317
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,890
<10-8,Raj>实际上我说的比哑巴还少
<10-8,Raj>Actually,I was less the chatter than the chat-ee.

318
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,710
<10-9,Leonard>她说什么了  她还生我的气吗
<10-9,Leonard>What did she say? is she still mad at me?

319
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,390
<10-10,Raj>刚开始她是很生气
<10-10,Raj>Well,she was upset at first,

320
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,090
<10-10,Raj>可能是因为她姐姐用枪射了某个人
<10-10,Raj>But probably because her sister shot somebody.

321
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:03,210
<10-10,Raj>然后好象说了点关于你的事
<10-10,Raj>But then there was something about you,

322
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,750
<10-10,Raj>然后她抱了下我
<10-10,Raj>And then she hugged me.

323
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,700
<10-11,Howard>她抱你了?  她怎么抱你的?
<10-11,Howard>She hugged you? how'd she hug you?

324
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:18,140
<10-11,Howard>那个香水是她身上的吗
<10-11,Howard>Is that her perfume I smell?

325
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,990
<10-12,Raj>非常醉人  是不是
<10-12,Raj>Intoxicating,isn't it?

326
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:39,870
<11-2,Leonard>好啊
<11-2,Leonard>Hi.

327
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,260
<11-3,Penny>你在干吗
<11-3,Penny>What's going on?

328
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:46,910
<11-3,Penny>是这样的
<11-3,Penny>Here's the thing.

329
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:56,020
<11-4,Leonard>潘妮  就象奥本海默
<11-4,Leonard>"penny,just as oppenheimer came to regret his contributions

330
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:57,690
<11-4,Leonard>后悔发明了原子弹一样
<11-4,Leonard>"to the first atomic bomb,

331
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:00,160
<11-4,Leonard>我也后悔了我的加入
<11-4,Leonard>"so too I regret my participation in what was,

332
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,380
<11-4,Leonard>至少是次错误的判断
<11-4,Leonard>"at the very least,an error in judgment.

333
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,070
<11-4,Leonard>一个伟大的实验的标志就是
<11-4,Leonard>"the hallmark of the great human experiment

334
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:08,230
<11-4,Leonard>敢于承认自己犯下的错误
<11-4,Leonard>"is the willingness to recognize one's mistakes.

335
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,730
<11-4,Leonard>有些错误  象居里夫人发现了镭
<11-4,Leonard>"some mistakes,such as madam curie's discovery of radium,

336
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,750
<11-4,Leonard>后来被证明有很大的科学研究价值
<11-4,Leonard>"turned out to have great scientific potential,

337
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:14,420
<11-4,Leonard>尽管她后来死于
<11-4,Leonard>"even though she would later die a slow,

338
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:16,190
<11-4,Leonard>漫长而痛苦的放射线危害
<11-4,Leonard>"Painful death from radiation poisoning.

339
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:21,190
<11-4,Leonard>还有另一个例子 埃博拉研究...
<11-4,Leonard>Another example,from the field of ebola research..."

340
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,220
<11-4,Leonard>里奥纳德  我们之间没事了
<11-4,Leonard>Leonard,we're okay.

<12-5,Penny>各位  我是在农场长大的
<12-5,Penny>You guys,seriously,I grew up on a farm,okay?

344
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:57,350
<12-5,Penny>我12岁的时候自己装起来了个拖拉机发动机
<12-5,Penny>I rebuilt a tractor engine when I was,like,12.

345
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,870
<12-5,Penny>我想我能装个廉价的瑞典电视柜
<12-5,Penny>I think I can put together a cheap,swedish media center.

346
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:02,950
<12-6,Leonard>还是我们来  这是我们唯一能做的  鉴于...
<12-6,Leonard>No,please. we insist. it's the least we can do,considering.

347
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:04,440
<12-7,Sheldon>鉴于什么
<12-7,Sheldon>Considering what?

348
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,450
<12-7,Sheldon>这个地方看起来有多么漂亮?
<12-7,Sheldon>How great this place looks?

349
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,900
<12-8,Howard (across room with Raj)>-我就担心这个  -怎么了
<12-8,Howard (across room with Raj)>-oh,boy. I was afraid of this. -what?
