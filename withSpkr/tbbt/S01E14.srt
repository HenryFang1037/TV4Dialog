1
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:06,420
<1-1,Sheldon>这三明治真是个彻底的失败品
<1-1,Sheldon>This sandwich is an unmitigated disaster.

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,510
<1-1,Sheldon>我点的是火鸡和烤牛肉
<1-1,Sheldon>I asked for turkey and roast beef

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:10,450
<1-1,Sheldon>全麦上放生菜和芝士
<1-1,Sheldon>With lettuce and swiss on whole wheat.

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:11,250
<1-2,Raj>那他们给你的什么?
<1-2,Raj>What did they give you?

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:12,480
<1-2,Raj>火鸡和烤牛肉
<1-2,Raj>Turkey and roast beef

6
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:15,280
<1-3,Sheldon>全麦上放的芝士和生菜
<1-3,Sheldon>With swiss and lettuce on whole wheat.

9
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:23,280
<1-3,Sheldon>东西确实一样  但是顺序不对啊
<1-3,Sheldon>It's the right ingredients, but in the wrong order.

10
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,610
<1-3,Sheldon>一个合格的三明治
<1-3,Sheldon>In a proper sandwich,

11
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,510
<1-3,Sheldon>它的芝士要紧贴着面包
<1-3,Sheldon>The cheese is adjacent to the bread

12
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:30,580
<1-3,Sheldon>这样会提供给生菜一个有水分的屏障
<1-3,Sheldon>To create a moisture barrier against the lettuce.

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,380
<1-3,Sheldon>他们可能带着这玩意过了一趟洗车房
<1-3,Sheldon>They might as well have dragged this thing through a car wash.

14
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,350
<1-4,Leonard>不太可能吧
<1-4,Leonard>I don't believe it.

15
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,250
<1-5,Sheldon>我知道  这是很基本的烹饪知识
<1-5,Sheldon>I know. it's basic culinary science.

16
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,380
<1-6,Leonard>有人拍卖了一个原版电影里用过的时间机器道具
<1-6,Leonard>Some guy is auctioning off a miniature time machine prop

17
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,980
<1-6,Leonard>但竟然没人竞拍
<1-6,Leonard>From the original film, and no one is bidding on it.

18
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,910
<1-7,Howard>电影"时间机器"里的时间机器?
<1-7,Howard>A time machine from the movie the time machine?

19
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,780
<1-8,Leonard>不  是"苏菲的选择"里的时间机器
<1-8,Leonard>No. a time machine from sophie's choice.

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,310
<1-9,Raj>厉害  苏菲在电影里是用过一个时间机器
<1-9,Raj>Boy, sophie could have used a time machine in that movie.

21
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,610
<1-9,Raj>你见过吗?  挺刚猛啊
<1-9,Raj>Did you see it? it's rough.

22
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,710
<1-10,Howard>酷毙了
<1-10,Howard>Oh, that's cool.

23
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:59,750
<1-12,Raj>只要800美金?
<1-12,Raj>It's only $800?

24
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,210
<1-13,Leonard>没错  那是我出的价钱
<1-13,Leonard>Yeah. and that's my bid.

25
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:02,550
<1-14,Sheldon>你出价800美元?
<1-14,Sheldon>You bid $800?

26
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,210
<1-15,Leonard>我没多想一时定下的嘛
<1-15,Leonard>It was a spur-of-the-moment thing.

27
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:05,710
<1-15,Leonard>我想它怎么都会飙到上千的
<1-15,Leonard>I figured it would go for thousands,

28
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:07,610
<1-15,Leonard>我只是想参与一下而已
<1-15,Leonard>And I just wanted to be a part of it.

29
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:09,750
<1-16,Sheldon>拍卖还剩30秒就结束了
<1-16,Sheldon>There's only 30 seconds left in the auction.

30
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:10,910
<1-17,Howard>你有800美金吗?
<1-17,Howard>Do you have $800?

31
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:13,280
<1-18,Leonard>撼动不了这台小型时间机器
<1-18,Leonard>Not to blow on a miniature time machine.

32
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,550
<1-19,Howard>别担心  一般大家都是
<1-19,Howard>Well, don't worry. the way these things work

33
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,010
<1-19,Howard>等到最后一秒钟
<1-19,Howard>Is people wait until the last second to bid,

34
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:17,850
<1-19,Howard>然后突然杀进来把它拍走  这就叫淘宝
<1-19,Howard>And then they swoop in and get it. it's called sniping.

35
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,080
<1-20,Raj>15秒
<1-20,Raj>15 seconds.

36
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,650
<1-21,Leonard>快点啊  淘宝人
<1-21,Leonard>Come on, snipers.

37
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,350
<1-22,Raj>10  9  8...
<1-22,Raj>Ten, nine, eight...

38
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,980
<1-23,Leonard>你的淘宝人呢?
<1-23,Leonard>Where are your snipers?

39
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,910
<1-24,Raj>5  淘啊
<1-24,Raj>Five... snipe.

40
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:28,910
<1-27,Leonard>4  淘啊
<1-27,Leonard>Four... snipe.

41
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:29,980
<1-28,Raj>3  淘啊
<1-28,Raj>Three... snipe!

42
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,050
<1-25,Leonard>2  淘啊
<1-25,Leonard>Two... snipe!

43
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,510
<1-28,Raj>1
<1-28,Raj>One...

44
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:34,480
<1-31,Leonard>祝贺你
<1-31,Leonard>Congratulations!

45
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,150
<1-34,Raj>你光荣地成为这台小型时间机器的主人了
<1-34,Raj>You are the proud owner of a miniature time machine!

46
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:40,180
<1-35,Howard>你个幸运的家伙
<1-35,Howard>You lucky duck.

47
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,350
<2-1,Sheldon>我想不通怎么没人竞拍了
<2-1,Sheldon>I wonder why no one else bid.

48
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,780
<1-36,Sheldon>这是部经典高科技电影里很有纪念意义的东西啊
<1-36,Sheldon>This is a classic piece of sci-fi movie memorabilia.

49
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,680
<1-37,Leonard>我知道  可我仍然没钱买它
<1-37,Leonard>Yeah, I know! I still can't afford it.

50
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:47,980
<1-38,Howard>要不我们一起凑钱吧?
<1-38,Howard>Why don't we share it?

51
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,410
<1-38,Howard>我们每人出200
<1-38,Howard>We'll each put in 200 bucks, and we'll

52
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:51,180
<1-38,Howard>然后我们轮流把它放家里
<1-38,Howard>Take turns having it in our house.

53
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,280
<1-39,Raj>一个时间共享的时间机器
<1-39,Raj>A time-share time machine.

54
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,680
<1-39,Raj>我同意  谢尔顿?
<1-39,Raj>I'm in. sheldon?

55
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,780
<1-40,Sheldon>还用你问吗?
<1-40,Sheldon>Need you ask?

56
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,250
<2-1,Sheldon>可我还是不明白怎么就没人出价
<2-1,Sheldon>I still don't understand why no one else bid.

57
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,350
<2-1,Sheldon>我明白为什么没人出价了
<2-1,Sheldon>I understand why no one else bid.

60
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,450
<2-1,Sheldon>那单子上确实有写是小型的吗?
<2-1,Sheldon>Did the listing actually say "miniature"?

61
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,410
<3-1,Raj>我也在想
<3-1,Raj>I just assumed.

62
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:51,450
<3-2,Leonard>谁会800块就卖一个完整尺寸的时间机器啊?
<3-2,Leonard>Who sells a full-size time machine for $800?

63
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:56,010
<3-3,Sheldon>在文氏图中  可能是一个在"不想要我的时间机器"
<3-3,Sheldon>In a venn diagram, that would be an individual located

64
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:57,380
<3-3,Sheldon>和"急需800块钱"两区间
<3-3,Sheldon>Within the intersection of the sets "no longer want my time machine"

65
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,550
<3-3,Sheldon>取交集的人
<3-3,Sheldon>And "need $800."

66
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,980
<3-4,Howard>这个价钱的确非常低了
<3-4,Howard>It's actually a tremendous bargain.

67
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,050
<3-4,Howard>就算加上运费
<3-4,Howard>Even with shipping, it works out

68
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,980
<3-4,Howard>算下来平均每磅不到4美金呢
<3-4,Howard>To less than four dollars a pound.

69
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,610
<3-5,Raj>调味酱稣虾是12块5
<3-5,Raj>Cocktail shrimp are $12.50.

70
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:13,280
<3-6,Leonard>我们怎么把这玩意弄上楼?
<3-6,Leonard>How are we going to get it upstairs?

71
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,210
<3-7,Howard>如果把这个盘子取下来
<3-7,Howard>If we take the dish off,

72
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,710
<3-7,Howard>应该能放进电梯里
<3-7,Howard>It might fit in the elevator.

73
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:20,780
<3-8,Leonard>对  可是电梯都坏了2年了
<3-8,Leonard>Yes, but the elevator has been broken for two years.

74
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,110
<3-9,Sheldon>我曾经想问过你
<3-9,Sheldon>I've been meaning to ask you.

75
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:24,280
<3-9,Sheldon>你说我们是不是该打个电话呢
<3-9,Sheldon>Do you think we should make a call about that?

76
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,250
<3-10,Howard>没必要
<3-10,Howard>Not necessary.

77
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,980
<3-10,Howard>我是工程学硕士
<3-10,Howard>I have a master's in engineering.

78
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,710
<3-10,Howard>我闭眼都能远程修复卫星
<3-10,Howard>I remotely repair satellites on a regular basis.

79
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:35,250
<3-10,Howard>我还能检修航天飞机载弹头
<3-10,Howard>I troubleshoot space shuttle payloads.

80
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:38,710
<3-10,Howard>当火星探测器开始向左行驶时
<3-10,Howard>When the mars rover started pulling to the left, I performed

81
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:43,150
<3-10,Howard>我在6200万英里以外进行用户接口联合
<3-10,Howard>A front-end alignment from 62 million miles away.

82
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,880
<3-10,Howard>不  这宝贝已经坏了
<3-10,Howard>No. that baby's broken.

83
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,950
<4-1,Leonard>加油啊  伙计们  用力推!
<4-1,Leonard>Come on, guys! push!

84
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,350
<4-2,Howard (off)>如果我再用力
<4-2,Howard (off)>If I push any harder,

85
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,480
<4-2,Howard (off)>就快把结肠给"分娩"出来了
<4-2,Howard (off)>I'm going to give birth to my colon.

86
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,410
<4-3,Raj (off)>我手指都快没知觉了  快点!
<4-3,Raj (off)>I can't feel my fingers. hurry up!

87
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:06,480
<4-4,Sheldon>不管多快
<4-4,Sheldon>It's the same amount of work

88
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,810
<4-4,Sheldon>工作量都是一样的
<4-4,Sheldon>No matter how fast you go.

89
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:08,980
<4-4,Sheldon>基本的物理原理
<4-4,Sheldon>Basic physics.

90
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:09,810
<4-5,Raj>-谢尔顿?  -干嘛?
<4-5,Raj>Sheldon? yeah?

91
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,810
<4-7,Raj>如果我的手指以后还能用
<4-7,Raj>If my fingers ever work again,

92
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:14,310
<4-7,Raj>我想我的中指以后有活干了
<4-7,Raj>I've got a job for the middle one.

93
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:15,810
<4-8,Penny (coming out of her apartment)>好  各位
<4-8,Penny (coming out of her apartment)>Oh. hey, guys.

94
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:17,110
<4-9,Leonard (letting go of time machine, as does Sheldon)>你好  潘妮
<4-9,Leonard (letting go of time machine, as does Sheldon)>Oh. hi, penny.

95
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,180
<4-9,Leonard (letting go of time machine, as does Sheldon)>休息一会吧
<4-9,Leonard (letting go of time machine, as does Sheldon)>Take a break, guys.

96
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,880
<4-10,Penny>你们在干什么
<4-10,Penny>What are you doing?

97
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,350
<4-11,Leonard>我们在...搬点东西上来
<4-11,Leonard>We're just, you know, moving something upstairs.

98
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,350
<4-12,Penny>什么东西
<4-12,Penny>What is it?

99
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,010
<4-13,Leonard>就是个...时间机器
<4-13,Leonard>Just... you know. time machine.

100
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,610
<4-14,Penny>好的  不错  但我要赶去工作了  所以...
<4-14,Penny>Yeah. okay. neat. but I really got to get to work.

101
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,480
<4-15,Leonard>-再给我们几分钟  -我等不了几分钟
<4-15,Leonard>Just give us a few minutes. I don't have a few minutes.

102
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,680
<4-16,Penny>我已经晚了
<4-16,Penny>I'm running really late.

103
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,580
<4-17,Sheldon>我有个简单的办法
<4-17,Sheldon>Then, I have a simple solution.

104
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,850
<4-17,Sheldon>去到楼顶  跳到另一栋楼顶上
<4-17,Sheldon>Go up to the roof. hop over to the next building.

105
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,280
<4-17,Sheldon>中间离得不远
<4-17,Sheldon>There's a small gap--

106
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,180
<4-17,Sheldon>如果你容易晕就别往下看
<4-17,Sheldon>Don't look down if you're subject to vertigo--

107
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,350
<4-17,Sheldon>然后走他们的楼梯井
<4-17,Sheldon>And use their stairwell.

108
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,950
<4-18,Penny>你逗我玩呢  是吧?
<4-18,Penny>You're joking, right?

109
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,010
<4-19,Sheldon>跟头晕有关的东西我从不开玩笑
<4-19,Sheldon>Oh, I never joke when it comes to vertigo.

110
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,650
<4-20,Penny>该死  好吧  我去房顶看看
<4-20,Penny>Damn. okay, I'll just take the roof.

111
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,550
<4-21,Leonard>如果你能等我们把时间机器都弄好了
<4-21,Leonard>Hey, if you wait for us to set up the time machine,

112
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,610
<4-21,Leonard>我可以把你送回到昨天上班时
<4-21,Leonard>I can drop you off at work yesterday.

113
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,880
<4-21,Leonard>时光旅行  开个玩笑...别介意
<4-21,Leonard>Time travel joke. it's not... never mind.

114
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,310
<4-22,Sheldon>从它的用途来看  我觉得还是挺好笑的
<4-22,Sheldon>For what it's worth, I thought it was humorous.

115
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,710
<4-23,Leonard>还是接着搬吧
<4-23,Leonard>Let's just do this.

116
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:14,150
<4-23,Leonard>兄弟们准备好推了没?
<4-23,Leonard>You guys ready to push?

117
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,410
<4-24,Raj>马上
<4-24,Raj>In a minute.

118
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:18,450
<4-24,Raj>霍华德到外面去吐了
<4-24,Raj>Howard stepped outside to throw up.

119
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,950
<5-1,Sheldon>我不懂你到底在担心什么
<5-1,Sheldon>I don't know what you were worried about.

120
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,850
<5-1,Sheldon>我觉得他放在房间里肯定能行
<5-1,Sheldon>I think it really works in the room.

121
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,080
<5-1,Sheldon>是啊
<5-1,Sheldon>Yeah.

122
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,910
<5-2,Leonard>这绝对是我拥有过的
<5-2,Leonard>It is by far the coolest thing

123
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,250
<5-2,Leonard>最酷的东西
<5-2,Leonard>I have ever owned.

124
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:35,110
<5-3,Sheldon>那个载着演员罗德·泰勒
<5-3,Sheldon>The exact time machine that carried actor rod taylor

125
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:36,510
<5-3,Sheldon>从维多利亚时代的英格兰
<5-3,Sheldon>From victorian england

126
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:38,450
<5-3,Sheldon>到临近未来世界末日的时间机器
<5-3,Sheldon>Into the post-apocalyptic future,

127
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,680
<5-3,Sheldon>那个社会分裂成两个派系
<5-3,Sheldon>Where society had splintered into the two factions

128
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,280
<5-3,Sheldon>居住在地下的"莫洛克"
<5-3,Sheldon>The subterranean morlocks, who survived by feasting

129
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,280
<5-3,Sheldon>他们靠吃住在地表的"埃洛依"维生
<5-3,Sheldon>On the flesh of the gentle surface-dwelling eloi.

130
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:50,480
<5-4,Howard>真是性感的万人迷啊
<5-4,Howard>Talk about your chick magnets.

131
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,710
<5-4,Howard>是  没错
<5-4,Howard>Oh, yeah.

132
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,850
<5-5,Raj>那个住我旁隔壁的家伙总是
<5-5,Raj>The guy who lives next to me is always like,

133
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,450
<5-5,Raj>"我的阳台上有个水流按摩浴缸
<5-5,Raj>"i have a jacuzzi on my balcony.

134
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,410
<5-5,Raj>我的阳台上有个水流按摩浴缸"
<5-5,Raj>I have a jacuzzi on my balcony."

135
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:00,880
<5-5,Raj>可等着看我告诉他
<5-5,Raj>But wait until I tell him,

136
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,310
<5-5,Raj>"我的阳台上有一台时间机器
<5-5,Raj>"i've got a time machine on my balcony.

137
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,050
<5-5,Raj>把泳裤裹裹紧吧  按摩浴缸"
<5-5,Raj>Stuff that in your speedo, jacuzzi bob."

138
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,350
<5-6,Sheldon>先生们  我知道我们说好是轮流拥有它
<5-6,Sheldon>Gentlemen, I know we said we'd take turns,

139
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,480
<5-6,Sheldon>但我想你们会认同说
<5-6,Sheldon>But I think you'll agree

140
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,880
<5-6,Sheldon>实际上就意味着它是留在这儿的
<5-6,Sheldon>That practicality dictates it remain here.

141
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,450
<5-7,Howard>你不能就这么独吞了
<5-7,Howard>You can't just keep it here.

142
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:16,710
<5-7,Howard>假如我碰到个小妞然后跟她说
<5-7,Howard>What if I meet a girl and say,

143
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:18,280
<5-7,Howard>"你想上去看看我的时间机器吗
<5-7,Howard>"you want to come up and see my time machine?

144
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,550
<5-7,Howard>它在我朋友家里"
<5-7,Howard>It's at my friends' house."

145
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,480
<5-7,Howard>多丢人啊!
<5-7,Howard>How lame is that?

146
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,210
<5-8,Raj>-他说的对  -好吧
<5-8,Raj>He's got a point. all right,

147
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:25,650
<5-9,Sheldon>我觉得我们该订些基本原则
<5-9,Sheldon>I think we're going to need some ground rules; in addition

148
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,250
<5-9,Sheldon>除了"进时间机器禁止穿鞋"
<5-9,Sheldon>To the expected "no shoes in the time machine,"

149
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,150
<5-9,Sheldon>以及"时间机器内禁止饮食"
<5-9,Sheldon>And "no eating in the time machine,"

150
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,010
<5-9,Sheldon>我还建议"进时间机器
<5-9,Sheldon>I propose we add "pants must be worn

151
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:33,610
<5-9,Sheldon>必须要穿裤子'
<5-9,Sheldon>At all times in the time machine."

152
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,810
<5-10,Leonard>赞成!
<5-10,Leonard>Seconded.

153
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,510
<5-11,Howard>我还准备在里面放条毛巾呢
<5-11,Howard>I was going to put down a towel.

154
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,180
<5-12,Raj>我还是希望它能放在我的阳台上
<5-12,Raj>I still want it on my balcony.

155
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,610
<5-12,Raj>我说我们就两月轮一次(或一月轮两次)吧
<5-12,Raj>I say we move it on a bi-monthly basis.

156
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:46,780
<5-13,Leonard>是啊  听上去挺公平
<5-13,Leonard>Yeah, that sounds fair.

157
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,750
<5-14,Sheldon>等等  两月轮一次很模棱两可啊
<5-14,Sheldon>Hold on, bi-monthly is an ambiguous term.

158
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,750
<5-14,Sheldon>意思是每两月搬一次还是每个月搬两次?
<5-14,Sheldon>Do you mean move it every other month or twice a month?

159
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,150
<5-15,Raj>-一月两次  -那就不行
<5-15,Raj>Twice a month. then no.

160
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,650
<5-17,Raj>那好  两月一次
<5-17,Raj>Okay, every other month.

161
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:54,850
<5-18,Sheldon>还是不行
<5-18,Sheldon>No.

162
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,610
<5-19,Leonard>谢尔顿  你不能这么自私!
<5-19,Leonard>Sheldon, you can't be selfish.

163
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:00,110
<5-19,Leonard>我们都付了钱  所以它是大家的
<5-19,Leonard>We all paid for it, so it belongs to all of us.

164
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:02,110
<5-19,Leonard>现在快让开  别挡着我进我的时间机器
<5-19,Leonard>Now get out of the way so I can sit in my time machine.

165
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,980
<5-19,Leonard>好的  我设置时间到1876年3月10日
<5-19,Leonard>Okay, I am setting the dials for march 10, 1876.

166
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,780
<5-20,Howard>好主意  亚历山大·格雷厄姆·贝尔
<5-20,Howard>Good choice, alexander graham bell

167
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,880
<5-20,Howard>发明了电话并打给了沃森博士
<5-20,Howard>Invents the telephone and calls out for dr. watson.

168
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,850
<5-21,Sheldon>等等  我也想看看这个场面
<5-21,Sheldon>Wait a minute. I'd want to see that, too.

169
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,380
<5-22,Leonard>轮到你的时候  随你想干嘛
<5-22,Leonard>So when it's your turn, you can.

170
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,280
<5-23,Sheldon>不过如果我们都去同一个时间点
<5-23,Sheldon>But if we all go back to the same point in time,

171
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,250
<5-23,Sheldon>贝尔的实验室就太挤了
<5-23,Sheldon>Bell's lab is going to get very crowded.

172
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,380
<5-23,Sheldon>他就会知道有大事发生了
<5-23,Sheldon>He'll know something's up.

173
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,510
<5-24,Raj>而且时间机器不会进行空间上的位移
<5-24,Raj>Also since the time machine doesn't move in space,

174
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:35,050
<5-24,Raj>所以你会"降临"在1876年的帕萨迪纳
<5-24,Raj>You'll end up in 1876 pasadena.

175
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,980
<5-25,Howard>即使你降临在了波士顿  你又能干嘛呢
<5-25,Howard>And even if you can make it to boston, what are you going to do?

176
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,150
<5-25,Howard>敲贝尔的门跟贝尔夫人说
<5-25,Howard>Knock on the door and say to mrs. bell,

177
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,780
<5-25,Howard>"嘿  贝尔夫人  我是你老公的疯狂粉丝
<5-25,Howard>"hey, mrs. bell. big fan of your husband.

178
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,550
<5-25,Howard>我能进来参观他发明电话吗?"
<5-25,Howard>Can I come in and watch him invent the telephone?"

179
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,710
<5-26,Raj>贝尔夫人是个聋子
<5-26,Raj>Mrs. bell was deaf.

180
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,050
<5-26,Raj>她甚至不会听到你敲门
<5-26,Raj>She's not even going to hear you knock.

181
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:47,880
<5-27,Sheldon>我有个办法
<5-27,Sheldon>I have a solution.

182
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:51,150
<5-27,Sheldon>首先去到未来弄一个隐身装置
<5-27,Sheldon>First, go into the future and obtain a cloaking device.

183
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,180
<5-28,Raj>多远的未来?
<5-28,Raj>Ooh, how far into the future?

184
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,350
<5-29,Sheldon>如果我没记错的话
<5-29,Sheldon>If I remember correctly,

185
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,210
<5-29,Sheldon>柯克舰长会在星际纪年5027.3
<5-29,Sheldon>Captain kirk will steal a cloaking device

186
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:58,210
<5-29,Sheldon>从罗姆兰偷走一个隐身装置(出自"星际迷航"系列)
<5-29,Sheldon>From the romulans on stardate 5027.3,

187
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:01,680
<5-29,Sheldon>之后被'先锋联盟舰队'于2328年1月10日所截获
<5-29,Sheldon>Which would be january 10, 2328 by pre-federation reckoning.

188
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:08,280
<5-30,Leonard>好吧  那我把时间设到2328年1月10日
<5-30,Leonard>Okay, I am setting the dials for january 10, 2328.

189
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,780
<5-30,Leonard>向未来  出发
<5-30,Leonard>Here we go into the future.

190
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,280
<5-30,Leonard>真有意思
<5-30,Leonard>That was fun.

191
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:35,810
<5-31,Raj>轮到我了
<5-31,Raj>My turn!

192
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,980
<5-32,Penny (entering)>首先
<5-32,Penny (entering)>Okay, first of all,

193
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,480
<5-32,Penny (entering)>那段你声称仅三英尺宽的距离
<5-32,Penny (entering)>What you call a gap was nearly three feet wide.

194
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,310
<5-32,Penny (entering)>-让我滑倒摔伤了我的膝盖  -你还好吧?
<5-32,Penny (entering)>I slipped and skinned my knee. are you okay?

195
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,350
<5-34,Penny>其次  那扇通往旁边那幢楼的
<5-34,Penny>Second of all, the door to the stairwell

196
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,610
<5-34,Penny>楼梯井门是锁着的
<5-34,Penny>Of the other building was locked,

197
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:49,080
<5-34,Penny>所以我不得不从防火梯下楼
<5-34,Penny>So I had to go down the fire escape,

198
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,210
<5-34,Penny>可那只是到三楼的
<5-34,Penny>Which ends on the third floor,

199
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:51,850
<5-34,Penny>逼我只能从一个"可爱"的亚美尼亚家庭
<5-34,Penny>Forcing me to crawl through the window

200
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,510
<5-34,Penny>的窗户爬了进去
<5-34,Penny>Of a lovely armenian family

201
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:55,880
<5-34,Penny>他们还强留了我吃午饭
<5-34,Penny>Who insisted I stay for lunch.

202
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,780
<5-35,Leonard>听起来还不坏嘛
<5-35,Leonard>That doesn't sound too bad.

203
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,480
<5-36,Penny>那是整整八斤羔羊肉
<5-36,Penny>It was eight courses of lamb,

204
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,210
<5-36,Penny>他们还试图撮合我和他们的儿子
<5-36,Penny>And they tried to fix me up with their son.

205
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:04,950
<5-38,Penny>-对不起  -还没完呢
<5-38,Penny>I'm sorry. not done.

206
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,380
<5-38,Penny>等我终于好不容易
<5-38,Penny>By the time I finally

207
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,780
<5-38,Penny>赶到那里上班  他们已经把我的班给换了
<5-38,Penny>Got to work, they'd given my shift away.

208
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,980
<5-38,Penny>是啊  没错
<5-38,Penny>Yeah, that's right.

209
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,280
<5-38,Penny>我损失了一整天的工资  就因为这个
<5-38,Penny>I lost an entire day's pay thanks to this.

210
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,150
<5-39,Sheldon>-这个...  -时间机器
<5-39,Sheldon>This... time machine.

211
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,580
<5-40,Leonard>灯会一闪一闪  托盘还会转  你想不想试试?
<5-40,Leonard>The lights flash and the dish spins. you want to try it?

212
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,950
<5-40,Leonard>才不!
<5-40,Leonard>No!

213
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,850
<5-41,Penny>我才不想试试!
<5-41,Penny>I don't want to try it!

214
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,510
<5-41,Penny>天哪  你们都已经是成年人了!
<5-41,Penny>My god, you are grown men!

215
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,250
<5-41,Penny>你们怎么能浪费生命
<5-41,Penny>How can you waste your lives with these

216
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:28,080
<5-41,Penny>整天弄这些蠢玩具和傻戏服
<5-41,Penny>Stupid toys and costumes

217
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,080
<5-41,Penny>还有漫画书还有...那个?!
<5-41,Penny>And comic books and... and now that?!

218
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,880
<5-42,Sheldon>-那个...  -再次提醒  时间机器
<5-42,Sheldon>That... again. time machine.

219
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:36,880
<5-43,Penny>拜托  那才不是什么时间机器
<5-43,Penny>Oh, please, it's not a time machine.

220
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,080
<5-43,Penny>这顶多就是看上去像艾尔顿·约翰
<5-43,Penny>If anything, it looks like something

221
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,510
<5-43,Penny>驶过大沼泽地的代步工具
<5-43,Penny>Elton john would drive through the everglades.

222
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:48,310
<5-44,Sheldon>这个只能在时间上移动
<5-44,Sheldon>It only moves in time.

223
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:51,710
<5-44,Sheldon>这个在沼泽地里会比无用更无用
<5-44,Sheldon>It would be worse than useless in a swamp.

224
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,310
<5-45,Penny>可悲!  你们这群人!
<5-45,Penny>Pathetic! all of you!

225
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:00,380
<5-45,Penny>可悲到了极点!
<5-45,Penny>Completely pathetic!

226
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,750
<5-45,Penny>该我了
<5-45,Penny>My turn.

227
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,710
<6-1,Sheldon>里奥纳德  现在可是凌晨2点
<6-1,Sheldon>Leonard, it's 2:00 in the morning.

228
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:29,250
<6-2,Leonard>怎么了
<6-2,Leonard>So?

229
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,610
<6-2,Leonard>该我了
<6-2,Leonard>So it's my turn.

230
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,750
<6-3,Sheldon>你为什么把时间设在前天?
<6-3,Sheldon>Why did you set it for the day before yesterday?

231
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,750
<6-4,Leonard>因为我想回到那天
<6-4,Leonard>Because I want to go back and keep myself

232
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,280
<6-4,Leonard>阻止自己买时间机器
<6-4,Leonard>From getting a time machine.

233
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,080
<6-5,Sheldon>这做不到  如果你想在过去
<6-5,Sheldon>You can't. if you were to prevent yourself

234
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,310
<6-5,Sheldon>阻止自己买时间机器
<6-5,Sheldon>From buying it in the past,

235
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:45,180
<6-5,Sheldon>你就不可能现在拥有一台时间机器
<6-5,Sheldon>You would not have it available in the present

236
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,410
<6-5,Sheldon>然后利用它回到过去
<6-5,Sheldon>To travel back and stop yourself

237
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:48,580
<6-5,Sheldon>阻止自己买它  所以你仍然会拥有它
<6-5,Sheldon>From buying it. ergo, you would still have it.

238
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,810
<6-5,Sheldon>这是典型的时间旅行低级错误
<6-5,Sheldon>This is a classic rookie time-travel mistake.

239
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:57,550
<6-6,Leonard>我可以回到过去让你闭嘴吗?
<6-6,Leonard>Can I go back and prevent you from explaining that to me?

240
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,080
<6-7,Sheldon>同样的低级错误
<6-7,Sheldon>Same paradox.

241
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,710
<6-7,Sheldon>如果你想回到过去
<6-7,Sheldon>If you were to travel back in time

242
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:02,110
<6-7,Sheldon>比如说  把我打晕
<6-7,Sheldon>And, say, knock me unconscious,

243
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:03,580
<6-7,Sheldon>那就不会有现在的对话
<6-7,Sheldon>You would not then have the conversation

244
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,050
<6-7,Sheldon>来把你激怒  让你想回到过去
<6-7,Sheldon>That irritated you, motivating you

245
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:07,380
<6-7,Sheldon>并且把我打晕
<6-7,Sheldon>To go back and knock me unconscious.

246
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,110
<6-8,Leonard>如果我现在想把你打晕呢?
<6-8,Leonard>What if I knocked you unconscious right now?

247
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,780
<6-9,Sheldon>那也改变不了过去
<6-9,Sheldon>It won't change the past.

248
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,580
<6-10,Leonard>不过会让我现在好受很多
<6-10,Leonard>But it'd make the present so much nicer.

249
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,080
<6-11,Sheldon>你有什么事心烦吗
<6-11,Sheldon>Are you upset about something?

250
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,110
<6-12,Leonard>你从哪看出来的
<6-12,Leonard>What was your first clue?

251
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:26,750
<6-13,Sheldon>有很多地方
<6-13,Sheldon>Well, it was a number of things.

252
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,080
<6-13,Sheldon>首先  你睡得很晚
<6-13,Sheldon>First, the late hour.

253
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,410
<6-13,Sheldon>其次  你的言行似乎没有活力
<6-13,Sheldon>Then your demeanor seems very low-energy,

254
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,210
<6-13,Sheldon>再加上你很易怒
<6-13,Sheldon>Plus your irritability.

255
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,210
<6-14,Leonard>是的  我很心烦!
<6-14,Leonard>Yes, I'm upset!

256
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,210
<6-15,Sheldon>我一般可不大了解这些的
<6-15,Sheldon>I don't usually pick up on those things.

257
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,440
<6-15,Sheldon>我不赖啊
<6-15,Sheldon>Good for me.

258
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,810
<6-16,Leonard>是啊  你不赖
<6-16,Leonard>Yeah, good for you.

259
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:43,070
<6-17,Sheldon>等等
<6-17,Sheldon>Oh, wait.

260
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:47,270
<6-17,Sheldon>你想聊聊为什么事心烦吗?
<6-17,Sheldon>Did you want to talk about what's bothering you?

261
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,540
<6-18,Leonard>不知道  可以吧
<6-18,Leonard>I don't know. maybe.

262
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,340
<6-19,Sheldon>哇  我今晚真是太强了
<6-19,Sheldon>Wow. I'm on fire tonight.

263
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,140
<6-20,Leonard>...是这样
<6-20,Leonard>Uh... here's the thing.

264
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:02,640
<6-20,Leonard>像潘妮这样的女孩是不会和玩时间机器的人在一起的
<6-20,Leonard>Girls like penny never end up with guys who own time machines.

265
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,510
<6-21,Sheldon>我不同意
<6-21,Sheldon>I disagree.

266
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,840
<6-21,Sheldon>你追求潘妮失败的经历
<6-21,Sheldon>Your inability to successfully woo penny

267
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,140
<6-21,Sheldon>是要远远早于得到时间机器的日期的
<6-21,Sheldon>Long predates your acquisition of the time machine.

268
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,810
<6-21,Sheldon>这个失败是显而易见的
<6-21,Sheldon>That failure clearly stands on its own.

269
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,010
<6-22,Leonard>多谢指出
<6-22,Leonard>Thanks for pointing it out.

270
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,040
<6-23,Sheldon>此外  你的前提是有瑕疵的
<6-23,Sheldon>In addition, your premise is flawed.

271
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,970
<6-23,Sheldon>在原版电影中  罗德·泰勒就是用时间机器
<6-23,Sheldon>In the original film, rod taylor got yvette mimieux

272
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:23,570
<6-23,Sheldon>得到了伊薇特·米米亚克斯(电影女主角)
<6-23,Sheldon>With that very time machine.

273
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:26,370
<6-23,Sheldon>回到未来  马帝·麦克佛莱得到了机会
<6-23,Sheldon>In back to the future, marty mcfly got the opportunity

274
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:28,910
<6-23,Sheldon>和他魅力十足的年轻妈妈鬼混
<6-23,Sheldon>To hook up with his extremely attractive young mother.

275
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,840
<6-24,Leonard>那些都是电影
<6-24,Leonard>Those are movies.

276
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,340
<6-25,Sheldon>当然都是电影
<6-25,Sheldon>Of course they're movies.

277
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,410
<6-25,Sheldon>你难道指望我举出个现实版
<6-25,Sheldon>Were you expecting me to come up with an example

278
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:39,270
<6-25,Sheldon>时间机器的例子吗?
<6-25,Sheldon>Involving a real-life time machine?

279
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,040
<6-25,Sheldon>荒谬
<6-25,Sheldon>That's absurd.

280
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,870
<6-25,Sheldon>加油啊  伙计们  用力推!
<6-25,Sheldon>Come on, guys, push!

281
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:47,570
<6-25,Sheldon>如果我再用力
<6-25,Sheldon>If I push any harder,

282
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,540
<7-1,Leonard>就快把结肠给"分娩"出来了
<7-1,Leonard>I'm going to give birth to my colon.

283
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,140
<7-2,Howard (off)>好  各位
<7-2,Howard (off)>Oh, hey, guys.

284
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,140
<7-3,Penny (coming out of her apartment)>你好  潘妮
<7-3,Penny (coming out of her apartment)>Oh. hi, penny.

285
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,470
<7-4,Leonard (letting go of time machine, as does Sheldon)>休息一会吧
<7-4,Leonard (letting go of time machine, as does Sheldon)>Take a break, guys!

286
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:00,170
<7-5,Penny>你们在干什么
<7-5,Penny>What are you doing?

287
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:04,010
<7-6,Leonard>你知道  就是搬搬时间机器
<7-6,Leonard>Oh, you know, just moving a time machine.

288
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:06,840
<7-7,Penny>好的  不错  但我要赶去工作了  所以...
<7-7,Penny>Yeah. okay, neat, but I really gotta get to work, so...

289
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,570
<7-7,Penny>没问题
<7-7,Penny>No problem.

290
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:15,870
<7-8,Leonard>坚持一下
<7-8,Leonard>Hang on.

291
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:19,510
<7-9,Penny>但是...你的时间机器怎么办
<7-9,Penny>But... what about your time machine?

292
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,910
<7-10,Leonard>有些事情比玩具更重要
<7-10,Leonard>Some things are more important than toys.

293
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,370
<7-11,Penny>我好害怕
<7-11,Penny>I'm scared.

294
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:35,040
<7-12,Leonard>不要害怕  宝贝  有我在
<7-12,Leonard>Don't worry, baby. I've got you.

295
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,240
<7-13,Penny>哦  里奥纳德
<7-13,Penny>Oh, leonard.

296
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,410
<7-14,Sheldon>仍旧该我了
<7-14,Sheldon>It's still my turn.

297
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,640
<8-1,Sheldon>你干什么
<8-1,Sheldon>What are you doing?

298
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:08,010
<8-2,Leonard>把我收集的所有东西打包
<8-2,Leonard>I'm packing up all my collectibles

299
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:10,410
<8-2,Leonard>然后带下去卖给漫画书店
<8-2,Leonard>And taking them down to the comic book store to sell.

300
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,810
<8-3,Sheldon>真的有必要吗
<8-3,Sheldon>Was that really necessary?

301
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,940
<8-3,Sheldon>如果需要钱  你随时可以卖血啊
<8-3,Sheldon>If you need money, you can always sell blood.

302
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,140
<8-3,Sheldon>还有精液
<8-3,Sheldon>And semen.

303
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,110
<8-4,Leonard>这和钱无关
<8-4,Leonard>This is not about money.

304
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,270
<8-5,Raj (entering)>我们带了吃的
<8-5,Raj (entering)>We brought food!

305
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:26,470
<8-6,Howard>熏鲑鱼和硬面包圈  时间旅人的早餐
<8-6,Howard>Lox and bagels, the breakfast of time-travelers.

306
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:27,740
<8-7,Leonard>棒极了
<8-7,Leonard>Terrific.

307
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,310
<8-7,Leonard>有人想要买我时间机器里的股份吗
<8-7,Leonard>Does anyone want to buy my share of the time machine?

308
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,040
<8-8,Raj>怎么
<8-8,Raj>Why?

309
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,440
<8-9,Leonard>我不想再要了
<8-9,Leonard>I don't want it anymore.

310
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,440
<8-8,Raj>为什么
<8-8,Raj>Why?

311
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,040
<8-11,Leonard>...私人原因
<8-11,Leonard>Just... personal reasons.

312
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,910
<8-12,Sheldon>我蜘蛛侠一般的嗅觉告诉我
<8-12,Sheldon>My spidey sense tells me

313
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,240
<8-12,Sheldon>这和潘妮有关
<8-12,Sheldon>This has something to do with penny.

314
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,640
<8-13,Leonard>听着
<8-13,Leonard>Look,

315
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,940
<8-13,Leonard>-你们到底想不想要买股份?  -我给你
<8-13,Leonard>Do you want to buy me out or not? I'll give you

316
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,570
<8-14,Raj>100美元  这样我就是半个拥有者了
<8-14,Raj>A hundred dollars, which will make me half-owner

317
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:43,870
<8-14,Raj>然后我们把它放到我的阳台上去
<8-14,Raj>And we'll put it on my balcony.

318
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:45,170
<8-15,Howard>去你的阳台
<8-15,Howard>Screw his balcony.

319
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:46,970
<8-15,Howard>我给你120美元  我要放到我的车库
<8-15,Howard>I'll give you $120 and we'll put it in my garage.

320
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:48,970
<8-16,Leonard>我的股份当时是200美金
<8-16,Leonard>I paid $200 for my share.

321
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:50,210
<8-17,Raj>小子  大家都知道
<8-17,Raj>Dude, everybody knows

322
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:51,640
<8-17,Raj>时间机器会因为转让
<8-17,Raj>A time machine loses half its value

323
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,140
<8-17,Raj>而贬低一半的价值
<8-17,Raj>The minute you drive it off the lot.

324
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,310
<8-18,Sheldon>我付200
<8-18,Sheldon>I'll go for $200.

325
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,940
<8-18,Sheldon>让时间机器就呆在原地
<8-18,Sheldon>That time machine stays right where it is.

326
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,510
<8-19,Raj>我付300
<8-19,Raj>$300 and I'll throw in

327
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,010
<8-19,Raj>我要打造最初的1973年的星战飞船
<8-19,Raj>My original 1979 mattel millennium falcon

328
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,740
<8-19,Raj>并使之兼具真正的光速和声效
<8-19,Raj>With real light speed sound effects.

329
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,370
<8-20,Leonard>不  不再要玩具和动作模型了
<8-20,Leonard>No. no more toys or action figures

330
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:09,870
<8-20,Leonard>也不要道具  复制品  戏服还有机器人
<8-20,Leonard>Or props or replicas or costumes or robots

331
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:11,510
<8-20,Leonard>也不要达斯·维德的变声工具了
<8-20,Leonard>Or darth vader voice changers.

332
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,240
<8-20,Leonard>我不想再要所有这些了
<8-20,Leonard>I'm getting rid of all of it.

333
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,410
<8-21,Howard>你不能这么做
<8-21,Howard>You can't do that.

334
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:15,740
<8-21,Howard>看看你收集的这些吧
<8-21,Howard>Look what you've created here.

335
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,040
<8-21,Howard>这就像是封闭的电脑狂人
<8-21,Howard>It's like nerdvana.

336
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,010
<8-22,Raj>更重要的是
<8-22,Raj>More importantly,

337
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,940
<8-22,Raj>你有达斯·维德的变声工具?
<8-22,Raj>You have a darth vader voice changer?

338
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,470
<8-23,Leonard>不会再有了
<8-23,Leonard>Not for long.

339
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:28,640
<8-24,Raj>我有权要求那"Golden Age Flash"(一部漫画)
<8-24,Raj>Oh, I call dibs on the golden age flash.

340
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:29,870
<8-25,Howard>等等  我要靠它来
<8-25,Howard>Hang on. I need that

341
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:31,540
<8-25,Howard>集全"正义联盟"(一部漫画)
<8-25,Howard>To complete my justice society of america collection.

342
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,710
<8-26,Raj>太遗憾了  我有权要求了
<8-26,Raj>Too bad. I called dibs.

343
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,070
<8-28,Raj>-你不能这么有权要求的  -我既可以也叫了
<8-28,Raj>You can't just call dibs. I can and I did.

344
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:35,410
<8-28,Raj>去维基百科查查"有权要求"吧
<8-28,Raj>Look up "dibs" in wikipedia.

345
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,010
<8-29,Sheldon>在竞价战中是没有有权要求的
<8-29,Sheldon>Dibs doesn't apply in a bidding war.

346
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,670
<8-29,Sheldon>这不是竞价战
<8-29,Sheldon>It's not a bidding war.

347
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:43,270
<8-30,Leonard>我全部要卖给楼下漫画书店的拉里
<8-30,Leonard>I'm selling it all to larry down at the comic book store.

348
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:44,510
<8-31,Raj>为什么是拉里  拉力有权要求了?
<8-31,Raj>Why larry? did larry call dibs?

349
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,970
<8-32,Howard>你能不能别提有权要求了?!
<8-32,Howard>Will you forget dibs?!

350
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:47,310
<8-33,Leonard>就这整套东西
<8-33,Leonard>He offered me a fair price

351
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,470
<8-33,Leonard>他提了个合理的价钱
<8-33,Leonard>For the whole collection.

352
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:50,040
<8-34,Sheldon>多少?  我给同样价钱
<8-34,Sheldon>What's the number? I'll match it.

353
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,810
