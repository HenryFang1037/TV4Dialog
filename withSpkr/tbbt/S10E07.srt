21
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:54,710
<1-11,Amy>各位观众可能注意到了  节目其中一个改变
<1-11,Amy>As you may notice, just one of the changes around here

22
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:56,790
<1-11,Amy>是多了驻场乐队
<1-11,Amy>is our new house band.

23
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:03,100
<1-12,Sheldon>还没搞清谁主谁次的乐队
<1-12,Sheldon>Who haven't learned their place yet.

24
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:08,910
<1-13,Amy>另一个改变是  我们在不同公寓给大家做直播
<1-13,Amy>We're also coming to you live from a different apartment.

25
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:12,340
<1-14,Sheldon>我与富勒博士在她的公寓遭水灾后
<1-14,Sheldon>Dr. Fowler and I began an experiment in living together

26
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,780
<1-14,Sheldon>开始了一段同居实验
<1-14,Sheldon>after her apartment became water damaged.

27
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,120
<1-14,Sheldon>这里是我们好友佩妮的公寓
<1-14,Sheldon>This is our friend Penny's place.

28
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,890
<1-14,Sheldon>你们可还记得她上过
<1-14,Sheldon>You may remember her from our episode

29
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:22,360
<1-14,Sheldon>"旗帜与不懂旗帜的人们"那一集
<1-14,Sheldon>"Flags and the People Who Don't Understand Them."

30
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:25,550
<1-15,Amy>本着同居生活的精神
<1-15,Amy>So, in the spirit of cohabitation,

31
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:28,710
<1-15,Amy>本集的主题将是两个地区
<1-15,Amy>the theme of today's episode is flags of two regions

32
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,480
<1-15,Amy>合二为一后的旗帜
<1-15,Amy>coming together as one.

33
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:34,260
<1-15,Amy>比如圣基茨和尼维斯[加勒比海岛国]
<1-15,Amy>Such as the flag of St. Kitts and Nevis.

34
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,970
<1-16,Sheldon>咱们来把"圣"余袖子卷起  好好认识"尼"吧
<1-16,Sheldon>So, let's roll up our "Sleevis" and get to know Nevis.

35
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:45,130
<1-16,Sheldon>这音效不错  但下次先问过我同意
<1-16,Sheldon>Well, I-I like that, but next time check with me.

36
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,020
<2-1,Amy>你们知道这旗子
<2-1,Amy>Did you know that the flag

37
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:50,220
<2-1,Amy>是由一位名叫埃德里切·路易斯的学生所设计...
<2-1,Amy>was designed by a student named Edrice Lewis...

38
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,060
<2-2,Penny>真不敢相信我会说这话
<2-2,Penny>I can't believe I'm saying this,

39
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,880
<2-2,Penny>但我们能转台看个新闻之类的吗
<2-2,Penny>but can we watch the news or something?

40
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:57,510
<2-3,Leonard>很有爱啊  他们很享受同居生活
<2-3,Leonard>It's cute, they're having fun living together.

41
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:00,150
<2-4,Penny>不知道她公寓修好后  他们打算怎么办
<2-4,Penny>Yeah, I wonder what they're gonna do when her apartment's ready.

42
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,110
<2-5,Bernadette>其实已经修好好几周了
<2-5,Bernadette>Actually, it's been ready for weeks.

43
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:03,330
<2-6,Leonard>你这话什么意思
<2-6,Leonard>What do you mean?

44
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:04,820
<2-7,Bernadette>工人提前完工
<2-7,Bernadette>Well, they finished the work early,

45
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,330
<2-7,Bernadette>但她一直告诉谢尔顿进度严重落后
<2-7,Bernadette>but she's been telling Sheldon they're behind schedule.

46
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:09,460
<2-8,Leonard>所以她就这么一直在骗他啊
<2-8,Leonard>So, she's just been lying to him?

47
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,110
<2-9,Penny>你也骗过谢尔顿啊
<2-9,Penny>Well, you've lied to Sheldon.

48
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:12,660
<2-10,Leonard>但我骗他是为了让他滚蛋
<2-10,Leonard>Yeah, but to make him leave,

49
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,830
<2-10,Leonard>不是骗他留下啊
<2-10,Leonard>not to make him stay.

50
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:20,880
<2-11,Sheldon>布达与佩斯融合成了布达佩斯
<2-11,Sheldon>Buda and Pest united to form Budapest.

51
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:20,880
<2-11,Sheldon>以前俩城市分别在多瑙河两岸  后来合而为一
<2-11,Sheldon>现在是匈牙利首都

52
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,790
<2-11,Sheldon>这就是为什么布达佩斯
<2-11,Sheldon>And that's why Budapest

53
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:25,260
<2-11,Sheldon>棒棒"达"
<2-11,Sheldon>is the "Budabest."

54
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,210
<2-11,Sheldon>上音效
<2-11,Sheldon>Now.

55
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:28,880
<2-12,Howard>好...
<2-12,Howard>Oh, right.

<3-1,Sheldon>Thank you for your services, gentlemen.

66
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:02,450

<3-1,Sheldon>Now, I'm hoping to broaden our audience

67
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:05,160
<3-1,Sheldon>能帮我们扩大观众群
<3-1,Sheldon>with your youthful rock and roll music.

68
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:09,340
<3-2,Howard>你还觉得自己有观众群  真是又萌又好笑
<3-2,Howard>Aw, you think you have an audience, that's funny.

69
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:12,720
<3-3,Raj>没工钱吗  屁都没吗
<3-3,Raj>We don't get paid? Nothing?

70
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,110
<3-3,Raj>连个三明治工餐都没有吗
<3-3,Raj>Not even a sandwich?

71
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:19,020
<3-4,Amy>要到晚饭时间了
<3-4,Amy>It's almost dinner time.

72
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,830
<3-4,Amy>有什么想吃的吗
<3-4,Amy>You in the mood for anything?

73
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:23,150
<3-5,Sheldon>我们可以去吃你公寓附近的泰国餐馆
<3-5,Sheldon>Yeah, we could get Thai food near your apartment

74
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:25,890
<3-5,Sheldon>顺便经过去看看修缮进度
<3-5,Sheldon>and then drop in and check on the progress.

75
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:30,140
<3-6,Amy>你会后悔的  那里可是工地
<3-6,Amy>Oh, you don't want do that, it's a construction zone.

76
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:31,960
<3-7,Sheldon>哪又怎么了
<3-7,Sheldon>So?

77
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:35,670
<3-8,Amy>工人会乱扔钉子乱露股沟  你不是怕有人这样吗
<3-8,Amy>Well, what about your fear of stray nails and butt cracks?

78
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,810
<3-9,Sheldon>我害怕的是踩到钉子
<3-9,Sheldon>I am terrified of stepping on a nail

79
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:41,130
<3-9,Sheldon>还有跌倒脸摔进股沟中
<3-9,Sheldon>and falling into a butt crack.

80
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,600
<3-10,Amy>所以晚餐到底怎么样
<3-10,Amy>Anyway, how about dinner?

81
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,620
<3-11,Sheldon>你要是愿意
<3-11,Sheldon>You know, if you'd like,

82
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:48,420
<3-11,Sheldon>我可以打给你的房东替你抱怨啊
<3-11,Sheldon>I could call your landlord and complain.

83
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,370
<3-12,Amy>谢谢  但是不用这样啦
<3-12,Amy>Thanks, but you don't have to.

84
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:53,390
<3-13,Sheldon>没事的  我可是抱怨投诉大师
<3-13,Sheldon>Oh, I don't mind, I'm very good at complaining.

85
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:56,200
<3-13,Sheldon>如果有奥林匹克投诉赛  我就会抱怨
<3-13,Sheldon>If it were an Olympic sport, I'd complain about

86
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,260
<3-13,Sheldon>这是什么傻逼运动  然后带着金牌回国
<3-13,Sheldon>what a stupid sport it is and then I'd take home the gold.

87
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,140
<3-14,Amy>有意思
<3-14,Amy>Good stuff.

88
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:05,290
<3-14,Amy>所以晚餐到底吃什么
<3-14,Amy>So, uh, what about dinner?

89
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,150
<3-15,Sheldon>是我的错觉
<3-15,Sheldon>Is it me

90
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,990
<3-15,Sheldon>还是你一直故意在转移主题
<3-15,Sheldon>or are you purposely changing the subject?

91
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,470
<3-15,Sheldon>才没有
<3-15,Sheldon>No.

92
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,450
<3-16,Amy>说到主题这件事
<3-16,Amy>And on the subject of subjects,

93
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:16,340
<3-16,Amy>你用的"主题"这个词  跟平常我们说到的
<3-16,Amy>is your use of the word "subject" the same or different

94
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:19,900
<3-16,Amy>一国之主的臣民[同词]是一样的吗
<3-16,Amy>as when we speak about the subject of a king?

95
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,350
<3-17,Sheldon>我感觉到你还在转移话题
<3-17,Sheldon>I have a feeling you're still doing it.

96
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,420
<3-17,Sheldon>但我觉得这个主题我无法抗拒
<3-17,Sheldon>But I find that topic irresistible, so,

97
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,910
<3-17,Sheldon>所以说  在古代的美索不达米亚
<3-17,Sheldon>now, in ancient Mesopotamia,

98
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:33,200
<3-17,Sheldon>一国之主把人民视为他的财产
<3-17,Sheldon>the king referred to the people as his property.

99
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,370
<4-1,Howard>我是说真的
<4-1,Howard>I'm serious,

100
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:38,780
<4-1,Howard>美国喷气推进实验室真的在研究
<4-1,Howard>JPL's actually developing a robot arm

101
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:41,690
<4-1,Howard>能在小星星砸到地球前就抓住它的机械手臂
<4-1,Howard>that could grab an asteroid before it hits us.

102
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:44,880
<4-2,Leonard>所以他们拯救地球免于受末日般灾害的计划
<4-2,Leonard>So their plan for saving the Earth from Armageddon

103
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,740
<4-2,Leonard>就是希望一帮书呆科学家能接住球吗
<4-2,Leonard>is hoping a bunch of scientists can catch a ball?

104
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:52,380
<4-3,Raj>如果都是要死  我还吃这么健康干嘛
<4-3,Raj>If we're all gonna die, why am I eating so much kale?

105
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,130
<4-4,Leonard>你静得出奇  怎么了吗
<4-4,Leonard>You're awful quiet, everything okay?

106
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,530
<4-5,Sheldon>我有点担心艾米
<4-5,Sheldon>I'm concerned about Amy.

107
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:01,400
<4-5,Sheldon>她最近有点怪怪的
<4-5,Sheldon>She's acting a bit odd lately.

108
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,940
<4-6,Howard>我  我就有点好奇
<4-6,Howard>Oh. Well, j-just out of curiosity,

109
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:06,670
<4-6,Howard>什么对你来说能算怪呢
<4-6,Howard>what registers as odd to you?

110
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:11,940
<4-6,Howard>她的行为举止
<4-6,Howard>Her behavior.

111
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:15,050
<4-7,Sheldon>我总觉得她有事情瞒着我
<4-7,Sheldon>No, I have the feeling that she's hiding something.

112
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,500
<4-8,Leonard>要我就不会担心这个
<4-8,Leonard>I wouldn't worry about it.

113
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,570
<4-8,Leonard>她可能只是工作上有些烦心事
<4-8,Leonard>She's probably just distracted by work.

114
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:20,370
<4-9,Sheldon>不管是什么事  这弄得我很闹心
<4-9,Sheldon>Well, whatever it is, it's troubling me.

115
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:22,270
<4-9,Sheldon>我吃不下  睡不着
<4-9,Sheldon>And I can't eat, I can't sleep.

116
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:25,850
<4-9,Sheldon>更别提我始终一贯的排便时间
<4-9,Sheldon>And don't even ask about the consistency of my bowel movements.

117
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:29,930
<4-10,Howard>你们听见啦  大伙们  不要提
<4-10,Howard>You heard him, guys, don't ask.

118
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,540
<4-11,Sheldon>她为什么要对我有所隐瞒
<4-11,Sheldon>Why would she keep something from me, you know?

119
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,110
<4-11,Sheldon>我连自己的肉体都跟那女人分享了
<4-11,Sheldon>I shared my body with that woman.

120
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:37,900
<4-11,Sheldon>还有收费视频网站的密码
<4-11,Sheldon>And my Netflix password.

121
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:42,800
<4-11,Sheldon>她害我推荐列表里出现了爱情烂片
<4-11,Sheldon>They recommended Stella Got Her Groove Back because of her.

122
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:44,610
<4-12,Leonard>兄弟  听我说
<4-12,Leonard>Buddy, buddy, listen,

123
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,280

<4-12,Leonard>nothing bad is going on,

124
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,120
<4-12,Leonard>她只是...
<4-12,Leonard>she just...

125
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,640
<4-12,Leonard>她只是不想让你知道  其实她的公寓
<4-12,Leonard>she just didn't want you to know that the work on her apartment

126
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,430
<4-12,Leonard>已经在几周前完工了
<4-12,Leonard>was finished a couple weeks ago.

127
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,330
<4-13,Sheldon>我不明白
<4-13,Sheldon>I don't understand.

128
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:57,390
<4-14,Leonard>她喜欢跟你住在一起
<4-14,Leonard>She's enjoying living with you

129
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:00,090
<4-14,Leonard>不想提早结束搬回去
<4-14,Leonard>and she didn't want it to end early.

130
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:02,710
<4-15,Sheldon>所以她欺骗我
<4-15,Sheldon>So, she's deceiving me

131
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:05,130
<4-15,Sheldon>是为了能跟我多待一段时间
<4-15,Sheldon>in order to spend more time with me.

132
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:06,380
<4-16,Leonard>是的
<4-16,Leonard>Yes.

133
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,740
<4-17,Sheldon>我真是既开心又伤心呀
<4-17,Sheldon>Well, I feel both flattered and hurt.

134
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:11,950
<4-17,Sheldon>就像别人说我长得像
<4-17,Sheldon>Like when people say I look like

135
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:15,280
<4-17,Sheldon>《圣诞夜惊魂》里面那个骷髅人
<4-17,Sheldon>that skeleton from Nightmare Before Christmas.

137
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,060
<4-18,Raj>天啊  终于知道你像谁了
<4-18,Raj>Oh my God, that's who you look like.

138
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,050
<4-19,Leonard>谢尔顿  没什么大不了的
<4-19,Leonard>Sheldon, this is not a big deal.

139
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,800
<4-19,Leonard>只是一个善意的小谎言  人人都会这样
<4-19,Leonard>It's a little white lie, everyone does it.

140
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,620
<4-20,Raj>我就不会
<4-20,Raj>Not me,

141
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:27,660
<4-20,Raj>我在所有感情里都是百分之百的诚实
<4-20,Raj>I'm a 100% honest in all of my relationships.

142
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,060
<4-21,Howard>单身狗的生活有多凄惨来着
<4-21,Howard>And how single are you right now?

143
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:33,590
<4-22,Raj>独自坐在马桶上吃蛋糕的那种凄惨
<4-22,Raj>Eating-cake-on-the-toilet single.

144
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:37,350
<4-23,Sheldon>我无法容忍感情里出现欺骗
<4-23,Sheldon>Well, I won't tolerate deception in my relationship.

145
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:39,440
<4-23,Sheldon>我无别选择  唯有跟她对质
<4-23,Sheldon>I have no choice but to confront her.

146
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,350
<4-24,Howard>千万别  你手里握着一张王牌啊
<4-24,Howard>Don't do that, you've got gold here.

147
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:44,370
<4-24,Howard>先收好了  等哪天换你做错事了
<4-24,Howard>Hang onto it until you're in trouble

148
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:47,440
<4-24,Howard>然后你就...  把这事甩她脸上
<4-24,Howard>and then... throw it in her face.

149
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,390
<4-25,Leonard>什么  你为什么要教他这个
<4-25,Leonard>What? Why would you tell him that?

150
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:51,010
<4-25,Leonard>这个建议太烂了
<4-25,Leonard>That's terrible advice.

151
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:54,290
<4-26,Howard>所以你不会想抓住佩妮的任何把柄吗
<4-26,Howard>So you wouldn't want to have anything on Penny?

152
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:56,220
<4-27,Leonard>当然不想
<4-27,Leonard>Well, of course not.

153
00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:00,110
<4-28,Howard>那么假设我现在手握一些把柄...
<4-28,Howard>So, if I actually know something right now...

154
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:01,820
<4-28,Howard>我还真有呢...
<4-28,Howard>and I do...

155
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:04,860
<4-28,Howard>你不会想要我告诉你吗
<4-28,Howard>...you don't want me to tell you?

156
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:08,120
<4-29,Leonard>不想
<4-29,Leonard>Pfft, no.

157
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,160
<4-30,Howard>我知道你内心是"想"的
<4-30,Howard>I'll take that as a "Yes."

158
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:14,010
<4-30,Howard>她正悄悄地把你的藏品收起来
<4-30,Howard>She's secretly been moving your collectibles into storage

159
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:16,280
<4-30,Howard>一次收一点  而你一直没察觉
<4-30,Howard>a little at a time and you haven't noticed.

160
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,560
<4-31,Leonard>开什么玩笑
<4-31,Leonard>Are you kidding me?

161
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,230
<4-32,Howard>是这样的  我都知道好几周了
<4-32,Howard>See, I've known that for weeks,

162
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,540
<4-32,Howard>但我一直在等  等一个时机
<4-32,Howard>but, you know, I waited till the moment

163
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:24,920
<4-32,Howard>一个会让他最痛苦的时机
<4-32,Howard>when it would cause him the most pain.

164
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:32,830
<5-1,Leonard>超人没了  帝国突击队没了
<5-1,Leonard>Superman's gone, my stormtrooper's gone.

165
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:35,980
<5-2,Sheldon>你的每日克林贡语日历也没了
<5-2,Sheldon>Your Klingon word-of-the-day calendar's gone.

166
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,550
<5-3,Leonard>我真想用克林贡语骂"靠"
<5-3,Leonard>I'd say "damn it" in Klingon,

167
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:40,250
<5-3,Leonard>但那个词是在下个月的日历上
<5-3,Leonard>but that wasn't until next month.

168
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,440
<5-4,Sheldon>是"酷瓦克"
<5-4,Sheldon>It's "Khoo-vakh."

169
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,120
<5-4,Sheldon>"酷瓦克"
<5-4,Sheldon>Khoo-vakh!

170
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,030
<5-5,Leonard>她把我的沃尔多收起来了
<5-5,Leonard>She took my Where's Waldo.

172
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,410
<5-6,Sheldon>不  他在那边
<5-6,Sheldon>Well, no, no, he's over there.

173
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:48,740
<5-7,Leonard>对哦  在那里
<5-7,Leonard>Oh, yeah, there he is.

174
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:54,850
<5-7,Leonard>你的公寓到底是什么回事呀
<5-7,Leonard>So, what's the deal with your apartment?

175
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:57,130
<6-1,Penny>为什么要修这么久
<6-1,Penny>Why's it taking so long?

176
00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:00,100
<6-2,Amy>干板墙的问题
<6-2,Amy>Um, it was a drywall problem.

177
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,980
<6-3,Penny>不会吧  怎么了
<6-3,Penny>Oh, no, what happened?

178
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:05,360
<6-4,Amy>干板墙湿了
<6-4,Amy>Well, the drywall got wet,

179
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,220
<6-4,Amy>没人会想要湿的干板墙
<6-4,Amy>and you do not want wet drywall

180
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:12,200
<6-4,Amy>因为干板墙湿了  它会变成...
<6-4,Amy>because when drywall gets wet, it's really more...

181
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,010
<6-5,Penny>湿墙吗
<6-5,Penny>Wet wall?

182
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,840
<6-6,Amy>或是潮湿的墙  反正都不好
<6-6,Amy>Or damp wall, just as bad. Mm.

183
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:22,410
<6-7,Penny>那干嘛不直接多弄点干板墙就好啦
<6-7,Penny>So why don't they just get more drywall?

184
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:25,020
<6-8,Amy>工人去买了
<6-8,Amy>Well, they went to get some,

185
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:28,240
<6-8,Amy>但卖墙的那个女人说
<6-8,Amy>but the woman at the wall store

186
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,870
<6-8,Amy>墙面正在打折  让工人们等等
<6-8,Amy>said it was going on sale and they should wait

187
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:33,560
<6-9,Penny>-因为...  -你扯够了没
<6-9,Penny>- because the savings... - Okay, are you done?

188
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,660
<6-9,Penny>伯纳黛特告诉我你的公寓已经完工了
<6-9,Penny>Bernadette told me your apartment's ready.

189
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:39,230
<6-10,Amy>本来在湿墙那里我就想打住  可你一直问问问
<6-10,Amy>I was done at wet wall, but you wouldn't let it go.

190
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:42,390
<6-11,Penny>谢尔顿真的相信你扯的屁话吗
<6-11,Penny>But is Sheldon really believing all this crap?

191
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:44,950
<6-12,Amy>他开始质疑  但我故意朝他打喷嚏
<6-12,Amy>Well, he started to question it, but then I fake sneezed on him

192
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:46,880
<6-12,Amy>他赶紧冲去洗澡了
<6-12,Amy>and he ran to take a shower.

193
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:50,270
<6-12,Amy>拜托别说了  我已经很内疚
<6-12,Amy>Please don't say anything, I feel terrible about this.

194
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,880
<6-13,Penny>别担心  我不会
<6-13,Penny>Oh, don't worry, I won't.

195
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,520
<6-14,Amy>谢谢
<6-14,Amy>Thanks.

196
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,630
<6-15,Penny>-"卖墙那个女人"  -别问了
<6-15,Penny>- "The woman at the wall store?" - Let it go!

197
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:02,600
<7-1,Sheldon>你会当面质问佩妮这事吗
<7-1,Sheldon>Are you going to confront Penny?

198
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,110
<7-2,Leonard>最后肯定会啊
<7-2,Leonard>Eventually, I guess.

199
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,450
<7-2,Leonard>尽管我有点好奇她觉得自己可以
<7-2,Leonard>Although, I am kind of curious how long she thinks

200
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:09,290
<7-2,Leonard>这样悄悄藏我东西多久不被我发现
<7-2,Leonard>she can keep hiding my stuff without me knowing.

201
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:13,480
<7-3,Sheldon>或许不跟她们对质
<7-3,Sheldon>You know, perhaps instead of confronting them,

202
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:17,120
<7-3,Sheldon>我们可以看看她们这张谎言网可以织多大
<7-3,Sheldon>we should see how far they're willing to spin their tangled webs.

203
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,450
<7-3,Sheldon>就像以前放在你桌面上的
<7-3,Sheldon>Like that Spider-Man action figure

204
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:20,540
<7-3,Sheldon>蜘蛛侠活动人偶
<7-3,Sheldon>that used to be on your desk.

205
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:23,050
<7-4,Leonard>天啊  我真是瞎了眼
<7-4,Leonard>Oh, my God, I'm going blind.

206
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,490
<7-5,Penny>饭买回来啦
<7-5,Penny>Hi. Food's here.

207
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,910
<7-7,Sheldon>太好了
<7-7,Sheldon>Excellent.

208
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,830
<7-7,Sheldon>我好饿啊
<7-7,Sheldon>I'm very hungry.

209
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:33,110
<7-7,Sheldon>说到这事
<7-7,Sheldon>Yeah, speaking of which,

210
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:35,350
<7-7,Sheldon>你的公寓是怎么回事
<7-7,Sheldon>what's going on with your apartment?

211
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,650
<7-8,Amy>工人还在修啊
<7-8,Amy>Oh, uh, they're still working on it.

212
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:40,120
<7-9,Sheldon>有意思
<7-9,Sheldon>Interesting.

213
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,220
<7-9,Sheldon>非常有意思
<7-9,Sheldon>Very interesting.

214
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,990
<7-10,Penny>是啊  我们去买饭的时候特地跑去看了
<7-10,Penny>Yeah, we swung by her apartment on the way to the restaurant,

215
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:48,370
<7-10,Penny>估计还有一段时间才能修好
<7-10,Penny>and they're gonna be fixing it for a while.

216
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:51,400
<7-11,Sheldon>等等  你去看她公寓了吗
<7-11,Sheldon>Wait, uh... you saw her apartment?

217
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,310
<7-12,Penny>是啊  离修好还远呢
<7-12,Penny>I did, still a mess.

218
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,290
<7-13,Sheldon>-莱纳德  -怎么了
<7-13,Sheldon>- Leonard? - Yeah?

222
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:16,110
<7-17,Amy>你为什么要说克林贡语
<7-17,Amy>W-Why are you speaking Klingon?

223
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:18,510
<7-18,Sheldon>那你为什么要说英语
<7-18,Sheldon>Why are you speaking English?

224
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,800
<7-19,Amy>你们太荒谬了
<7-19,Amy>This is ridiculous.

225
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,220
<7-19,Amy>佩妮  你还记得我以前教过你儿童游戏语吗
<7-19,Amy>Penny, do you remember when I taught you Ubbi Dubbi?

231
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,050
<7-23,Sheldon>你们不准说鸟语
<7-23,Sheldon>Oh, wait, stop that.

232
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,420
<7-24,Amy>你才不准说外星语呢
<7-24,Amy>You stop that.

236
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:49,670
<7-26,Leonard>够了  你们这几个
<7-26,Leonard>Okay. That's enough. You know what?

237
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:52,430
<7-27,Sheldon>到底是怎么回事
<7-27,Sheldon>What is going on?

238
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:55,580
<7-29,Leonard>好吧  我告诉谢尔顿艾米的公寓已经修好了
<7-29,Leonard>Fine, I told Sheldon that her apartment's been finished,

239
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,740
<7-29,Leonard>可你刚才却说没修好
<7-29,Leonard>but then you just said it's not,

240
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,550
<7-29,Leonard>所以我现在也搞糊涂了
<7-29,Leonard>so now I'm all confused.

241
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,920
<7-30,Amy>佩妮只是在帮我打掩护而已
<7-30,Amy>Penny was just covering for me.

242
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,940
<7-30,Amy>我的公寓已经修好整整两周了
<7-30,Amy>My place has been ready for two weeks.

243
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,160
<7-31,Sheldon>你怎么能骗我呢
<7-31,Sheldon>How could you lie to me?

244
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,380
<7-32,Penny>她只是喜欢跟你住在一起
<7-32,Penny>Uh, she's enjoyed living with you.

245
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:07,220
<7-32,Penny>这就叫陷入爱河
<7-32,Penny>It's called being in love.

246
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,530
<7-33,Leonard>那么你偷偷处理掉老公的私人物品
<7-33,Leonard>Mm-hmm, and what's it called when you secretly get rid

247
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:10,990
<7-33,Leonard>这种行为又叫什么
<7-33,Leonard>of all your husband's stuff?

248
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:13,050
<7-34,Penny>啥...这不是真的
<7-34,Penny>Wha... That is not true!

249
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:14,900
<7-35,Leonard>博纳黛特告诉霍华德  霍华德又告诉我了
<7-35,Leonard>Bernadette told Howard, Howard told me.

250
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,550
<7-35,Leonard>再说我自己能看出来东西都不见了
<7-35,Leonard>Plus, I can see all my stuff is gone!

251
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:20,480
<7-36,Penny>比起我来  你更相信你朋友  朋友的老婆
<7-36,Penny>Oh, so, you believe your friend, and your friend's wife

252
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,140
<7-36,Penny>还有你自己的眼睛吗
<7-36,Penny>and your own eyes over me?

253
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,400
<7-37,Leonard>你真的以为我不会发现我的东西不见了吗
<7-37,Leonard>You really didn't think I'd notice my stuff was missing?

254
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,710
<7-38,Penny>你注意到你的钥匙链了吗
<7-38,Penny>Uh, did you notice your key chain?

255
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,960
<7-39,Leonard>人家的蝙蝠侠呢

376
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:44,950
<11-5,Leonard>你得踏过我穿露屁皮裤的尸体
<11-5,Leonard>Over my assless chaps you will.

377
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,990
<11-6,Howard>这事情没那么复杂
<11-6,Howard>This isn't complicated.

378
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:49,100
<11-6,Howard>你爱不爱艾米
<11-6,Howard>Do you love Amy?

379

380
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,830
<11-8,Raj>你喜欢和她一起住吗
<11-8,Raj>Do you like living with her?

381
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:52,880
<11-9,Sheldon>喜欢
<11-9,Sheldon>Yes.

382
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,610
<11-10,Leonard>现在你明白该怎么办了吧
<11-10,Leonard>Do you know what you need to do now?

383
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,490
<11-11,Sheldon>明白该靠我自己想清楚
<11-11,Sheldon>Apparently, figure this out on my own

384
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:59,430
<11-11,Sheldon>因为你们一点屁忙都帮不上
<11-11,Sheldon>'cause you guys are no help at all.

385
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:24,250
<12-3,Amy>你在干什么
<12-3,Amy>What are you doing?

386

<12-4,Sheldon>我在当布里丹之驴
<12-4,Sheldon>I'm just contemplating Buridan's donkey.

387
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,130
<12-5,Amy>我懂了
<12-5,Amy>I understand.

388
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:31,950
<12-5,Amy>那我不打扰你了
<12-5,Amy>I'll leave you be.

389
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,410
<12-6,Sheldon>怎么  你懂这个哏吗
<12-6,Sheldon>What, you're familiar with the reference?

390
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:37,740
<12-6,Sheldon>当然
<12-6,Sheldon>Of course.

391
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:40,300
<12-7,Amy>让·布里丹提出的一个哲学论点
<12-7,Amy>Jean Buridan proposed a philosophical thesis

<12-7,Amy>放在两捆完全相同的草料正中间
<12-7,Amy>placed between two equidistant bales of hay

394
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:46,020
<12-7,Amy>会因无法做决定而卡在原地
<12-7,Amy>would be paralyzed by indecision

395
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,900
<12-7,Amy>最终活活饿死
<12-7,Amy>and would starve to death.

396
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:54,350
<12-8,Sheldon>就是这样
<12-8,Sheldon>Exactly.

397
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,940
<12-9,Amy>我不希望你活活饿死  所以
<12-9,Amy>Well, I wouldn't want you to starve to death, so...

398
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,510
<12-9,Amy>给你根茄子
<12-9,Amy>...here's an eggplant.

<12-11,Amy>知道吗  有人说布里丹
<12-11,Amy>You know, some people believe that Buridan

401
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,010
<12-11,Amy>是抄袭亚里士多德
<12-11,Amy>was plagiarizing Aristotle.

402
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:11,550
<12-12,Sheldon>是吗
<12-12,Sheldon>Really?

403
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,660
<12-13,Amy>不过在亚里士多德的例子里
<12-13,Amy>Although, in Aristotle's example,

404
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:16,170
<12-13,Amy>说的是一个口渴与饥饿程度相等的人
<12-13,Amy>he proposed an equally hungry and thirsty man

405
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:18,270
<12-13,Amy>在食物和水之间犹豫不决
<12-13,Amy>caught between food and drink.

406
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:20,720
<12-14,Sheldon>不知道这和十二世纪的
<12-14,Sheldon>Yeah, I wonder if that's related

407
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,840
<12-14,Sheldon>波斯哲学家安萨里提出的
<12-14,Sheldon>to the 12th century Persian philosopher, al-Ghazali

408
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,650
<12-14,Sheldon>一个男人在两个小妞中犹豫不决有没有关系
<12-14,Sheldon>and his story of a man caught between two dates.

409
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:30,150
<12-15,Amy>你是在说安萨里是亚里士多德派的吗
<12-15,Amy>Are you suggesting al-Ghazali was Aristotelian?

410
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:33,700
<12-15,Amy>可他是最反对亚里士多德哲学的人
<12-15,Amy>'Cause if anything, he was anti-Aristotelian.

411
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,920
<12-15,Amy>安萨里反亚里士多德吗
<12-15,Amy>Al-Ghazali was anti-Aristotelian?

412
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,820
<12-16,Sheldon>天啊  真是知人知面不知心啊
<12-16,Sheldon>Boy, you think you know a guy.

415
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:58,310
<13-3,Penny>我知道可能有点过了
<13-3,Penny>I-I know I went a little overboard.

416
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,460
<13-3,Penny>我们随时可以改回去
<13-3,Penny>We can always dial it back.
