<3-1,Sheldon>目的是为了保住王位
<3-1,Sheldon>in order to preserve his throne.

43
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:34,670
<3-1,Sheldon>理所当然的  你  他的文化继承者
<3-1,Sheldon>Surely, you, his cultural descendant,

60
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,870
<3-12,Penny>我在浴缸里滑倒了
<3-12,Penny>I slipped in the shower,

61
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:28,600
<3-12,Penny>我觉得肩膀好像脱臼了
<3-12,Penny>and I think I dislocated my shoulder.

62
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:31,400
<3-13,Sheldon>这不奇怪
<3-13,Sheldon>Not surprising.

63
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,530
<3-13,Sheldon>你没有装防滑垫或者防滑贴纸
<3-13,Sheldon>You have no safety mat or adhesive stickers

64
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,500
<3-13,Sheldon>来抵消浴缸表面的
<3-13,Sheldon>to allow for purchase on a surface

65
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:38,130
<3-13,Sheldon>很低的静摩擦系数
<3-13,Sheldon>with a low coefficient of static friction.

66
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,230
<3-14,Penny>什么
<3-14,Penny>What?

67
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,630
<3-15,Sheldon>浴缸都很滑的
<3-15,Sheldon>Tubs are slippery.

68
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,930
<3-16,Penny>我知道  我滑倒了
<3-16,Penny>I know. I slipped.

00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,970
<3-17,Sheldon>我有一个系列的古怪鸭贴纸
<3-17,Sheldon>I have a series of whimsical duck stickers

70
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:49,030
<3-17,Sheldon>贴在我的浴缸底部
<3-17,Sheldon>on the bottom of my tub.

71
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,170
<3-18,Penny>好吧  无论如何
<3-18,Penny>Yeah, okay, whatever.

72
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,000
<3-18,Penny>你能把水关掉再扶我起来吗
<3-18,Penny>Will you just turn the water off and help me up?

73
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:54,970
<3-19,Sheldon>他们都撑着伞的
<3-19,Sheldon>They're holding umbrellas.

74
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,700
<3-20,Penny>什么
<3-20,Penny>What?

75
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,230
<3-21,Sheldon>我浴缸里的鸭子
<3-21,Sheldon>The ducks in my tub.

76
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:02,330
<3-23,Sheldon>它们怪就怪在这些鸭子既没有需要
<3-23,Sheldon>They're whimsical because ducks have neither a need for,

77
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,700
<3-23,Sheldon>也没有能力来使用雨伞
<3-23,Sheldon>nor the ability to use, umbrellas.

78
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:07,130
<3-24,Penny>上帝啊  我得去急救中心了
<3-24,Penny>Oh, my God. I got to go to the emergency room.

79
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,430
<3-25,Sheldon>如果你确定你的右上膊骨
<3-25,Sheldon>Well, assuming you're correct that your right humerus

80
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,100
<3-25,Sheldon>不再固定在肩臼上
<3-25,Sheldon>is no longer seated in the glenoid socket,

81
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:13,770
<3-26,Penny>-我当然认为你该去急救中心  -你能车我去吗
<3-26,Penny>- I would certainly think so.  - Okay, can you drive me?

82
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,230
<3-27,Sheldon>我不开车的
<3-27,Sheldon>I don't drive.

83
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,370
<3-28,Penny>但我开不了
<3-28,Penny>Well, I can't drive!

84
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:19,230
<3-29,Sheldon>看来我们到达了一个僵局
<3-29,Sheldon>Well, it seems we've reached an impasse.

85
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,800
<3-31,Sheldon>我可以帮你叫辆的士或者救护车
<3-31,Sheldon>I could call you a cab or an ambulance.

86
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,470
<3-32,Penny>不 不 不  我等不及了
<3-32,Penny>No, no, no. I can't wait that long.

87
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:25,830
<3-32,Penny>你必须得帮我  求你了
<3-32,Penny>You got to help me, please.

88
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,870
<3-33,Sheldon>好的  不能让人说谢尔顿·李·库珀
<3-33,Sheldon>All right. Let it never be said that Sheldon Lee Cooper

89
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:31,970
<3-33,Sheldon>是个无视陷入困境的少女的人
<3-33,Sheldon>ignored the pleas of a damsel in distress.

90
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:33,800
<3-34,Penny>没人这么说  快走吧
<3-34,Penny>No one's saying that. Let's go.

91
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,530
<3-35,Sheldon>因没买99美分的防滑鸭子
<3-35,Sheldon>Well, it does seem rather ironic

92
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,700
<3-35,Sheldon>而导致两个人都可能死于惨烈的车祸
<3-35,Sheldon>that for want of 99-cent adhesive ducks,

93
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:40,000
<3-35,Sheldon>这看上去真是非常讽刺
<3-35,Sheldon>we both might die in a fiery car crash.

94
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,700
<4-1,Leonard>我真希望佩妮不用去工作
<4-1,Leonard>I wish Penny didn't have to work.

95
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:44,830
<4-1,Leonard>她喜欢野营
<4-1,Leonard>She loves camping.

96
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,430
<4-2,Raj>是啊  那就太好了
<4-2,Raj>Yeah, that would have been great.

97
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,130
<4-2,Raj>你和佩妮在帐篷里做爱
<4-2,Raj>You and Penny having sex in the tent

98
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:51,000
<4-2,Raj>而我则坐在外面看霍华德拿仙人掌爆菊
<4-2,Raj>while I sit out here and watch Howard hump a cactus.

99
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,630
<4-3,Howard>好的  我已经尽力侦查了
<4-3,Howard>Okay, the best I can tell,

100
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,230
<4-3,Howard>附近还有8个野营地
<4-3,Howard>there are eight other campsites nearby.

101
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,670
<4-3,Howard>大多都是像我们这样的科学呆子
<4-3,Howard>Mostly science nerds like us,

102
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:01,800
<4-3,Howard>不过山脊另一边
<4-3,Howard>but just over yon ridge are two

<4-3,Howard>有两位不无魅力的中学老师
<4-3,Howard>not unattractive middle school teachers

104
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,500
<4-3,Howard>浑身散发着绝望主妇的气息
<4-3,Howard>who reek of desperation.

105
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:07,470
<4-4,Raj>太好了
<4-4,Raj>Wow. Wonderful.

106
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:09,200
<4-4,Raj>-她们多大  -我不知道
<4-4,Raj>- How old are they? - I don't know.

109
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:17,300
<4-6,Raj>天然的节育控制
<4-6,Raj>Nature's birth control.

110
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:18,470
<4-7,Leonard>拜托
<4-7,Leonard>Come on.

111
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:20,230
<4-7,Leonard>你们不会这么饥渴吧
<4-7,Leonard>You guys can't be that hard up.

112
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,370
<4-9,Raj>-我饥渴  -我也是
<4-9,Raj>- I am. - Yeah, me, too.

113
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:25,730
<4-10,Howard>看  她们还送了点自制曲奇给我们
<4-10,Howard>Look-- they gave me homemade cookies.

114
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,770
<4-11,Leonard>当然会给
<4-11,Leonard>Of course, they did.

115
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,430
<4-11,Leonard>老奶奶都这样
<4-11,Leonard>That's what grandmothers do.

116
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,070
<4-12,Raj>那我们还等什么
<4-12,Raj>So, what are we waiting for?

117
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:31,170
<4-13,Howard>悠着点
<4-13,Howard>Relax.

118
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,970
<4-13,Howard>我说等她们打完盹
<4-13,Howard>I said we'd stop by a little later

119
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,100
<4-13,Howard>我们再过去
<4-13,Howard>after they have their nap.

120

<4-14,Raj>好主意

137
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,100
<5-3,Sheldon>以防发生意外
<5-3,Sheldon>in case one is in an accident.

00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:23,200
<5-4,Penny>我已经发生意外了
<5-4,Penny>One was already in an accident.

139
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,870
<5-5,Sheldon>那不表示不会再发生意外
<5-5,Sheldon>That doesn't mean one won't be in another,

140
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:26,300
<5-5,Sheldon>尤其是我开车的情况下

166
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:28,670
<5-23,Sheldon>感觉不像手臂
<5-23,Sheldon>It doesn't feel like an arm.

167
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:31,570
<5-24,Penny>那你是不是该放手了
<5-24,Penny>Then, maybe you should let it go.

<6-1,Leonard>Stars are pretty, aren't they?

170
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:54,630

<6-2,Howard>Up above the world so high.

171
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:58,200
<6-2,Howard>像天上的小钻石
<6-2,Howard>Like little diamonds in the sky.

<6-3,Raj>You should... you should write that down

174
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,070
<6-3,Raj>免得被人山寨了
<6-3,Raj>before someone steals it.

175
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:07,170
<6-4,Howard>流星雨什么时候来
<6-4,Howard>So, when do the meteors get here?

<6-4,Howard>不是流星雨来这里
<6-4,Howard>The meteors don't get here.

177
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:10,930
<6-5,Raj>是地球走到他们的轨道上了

180
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:20,570
<6-6,Leonard>移动得太快
<6-6,Leonard>It's moving too fast.

181
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,300
<6-6,Leonard>拉杰  让地球慢点
<6-6,Leonard>Raj, slow it down.

00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,030
<6-11,Raj>笑你的美国口音
<6-11,Raj>It's your American accent.

187
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,600
<6-11,Raj>你说的话都很傻逼
<6-11,Raj>Everything you say sounds stupid.

00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:52,970
<6-11,Raj>星星多漂漂啊
<6-11,Raj>"Stars are pretty, aren't they?"

189
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:04,330
<7-1,Sheldon>为准确起见  我得告诉你
<7-1,Sheldon>For the record, I should let you know

00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:08,000
<7-1,Sheldon>这是我第一次开真的汽车
<7-1,Sheldon>this is my first time driving an actual motor vehicle.

00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:17,770
<7-5,Sheldon>-那就行  -但效果不太好
<7-5,Sheldon>- Good. - Didn't work out well.

<7-6,Penny>-行了  能开了吗  -等一下
<7-6,Penny>- All right, can we please go? - One moment.

196
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,730
<7-7,Sheldon>驾驶培训书里说
<7-7,Sheldon>According to my driver's ed book,

197
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,900
<7-7,Sheldon>侧视镜的正确角度是
<7-7,Sheldon>the side mirror is properly adjusted

198
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:26,170
<7-7,Sheldon>调到能在镜子的右下角
<7-7,Sheldon>when the driver's door handle

200
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:28,870
<7-7,Sheldon>看到门拉手了
<7-7,Sheldon>There's the handle.

201
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:30,270
<7-7,Sheldon>不不  太过了
<7-7,Sheldon>Oh, no, too far.

202
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:33,000
<7-7,Sheldon>往回一点点
<7-7,Sheldon>Bringing it back.

203
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:34,370
<7-7,Sheldon>这才正好
<7-7,Sheldon>Optimized.

204
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:36,070
<7-9,Sheldon>好  调整副驾驶座
<7-9,Sheldon>Now, where is the switch

205
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:38,200
<7-9,Sheldon>后视镜的调节器呢
<7-9,Sheldon>to adjust the passenger side mirror?

206
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:40,130
<7-8,Penny>就在这里
<7-8,Penny>It's right there.

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,970
<7-9,Sheldon>副驾驶座的后视镜在哪儿呢
<7-9,Sheldon>Where is the passenger side mirror?

208
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,170
<7-10,Penny>在好莱坞的停车场时被撞掉了
<7-10,Penny>In a parking lot in Hollywood.

00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:49,430
<7-10,Penny>-行行好  我们能走了吗  -好
<7-10,Penny>- Now, can we please go? - Yes.

210
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,800
<7-11,Sheldon>先等我调整好座椅
<7-11,Sheldon>As soon as I adjust my seat.

211
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,100
<7-11,Sheldon>噢  老天
<7-11,Sheldon>Oh, dear.

212
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:04,030
<7-11,Sheldon>我又得重来一次
<7-11,Sheldon>I'm going to have to start again.

213
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:14,930
<8-1,Raj>如果我会说兔子的语言
<8-1,Raj>If I could speak the language of rabbits,

214

<8-1,Raj>那就太美妙了  我将成为兔王
<8-1,Raj>that will be amazed, I will be their king.

215
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:23,100
<8-2,Leonard>我讨厌我的名字
<8-2,Leonard>I hate my name.

216
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:27,430
<8-2,Leonard>读起来像个呆子
<8-2,Leonard>It has "nerd" in it.

217
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:33,500
<8-2,Leonard>莱呆子
<8-2,Leonard>Len-nerd.

218
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:36,870
<8-3,Howard>我的第一次是和我的表姐珍妮
<8-3,Howard>I lost my virginity to my cousin Jeanie.

219
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,570
<8-4,Raj>我会仁慈地对待我的兔民们
<8-4,Raj>I would be kind to my rabbit subjects.

220
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,100
<8-4,Raj>当然只是开始而已
<8-4,Raj>At first.

221
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:48,830
<8-5,Leonard>知道什么才叫酷名吗
<8-5,Leonard>You know what's a cool name?

222
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,370
<8-5,Leonard>安杰洛
<8-5,Leonard>Angelo.

223
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:54,770
<8-5,Leonard>有天使又有洁露果子冻
<8-5,Leonard>That has angel and Jell-O in it.

224
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:57,900
<8-6,Howard>那是在我穆雷舅舅的葬礼上
<8-6,Howard>It was my Uncle Murray's funeral.

225
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:00,400
<8-6,Howard>我们在芭芭拉阿姨的房子后面
<8-6,Howard>We were all back at my Aunt Barbara's house.

226
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:02,870
<8-6,Howard>透过一条腌鲱鱼  我们四目相接
<8-6,Howard>Our eyes locked over the pickled herring.

227
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:04,930
<8-6,Howard>我们本来没想着会发生关系的
<8-6,Howard>We never meant for it to happen.

228
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:09,500
<8-7,Raj>一天  我为法国总统举办了一场盛大舞会
<8-7,Raj>One day, I hold a great ball for the President of France,

229
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:11,700
<8-7,Raj>但是兔民们  因为憎恨我而没来捧场
<8-7,Raj>but the rabbits-- they hate me and don't come.

230
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:14,670
<8-7,Raj>我极为尴尬  于是我逼它们眼睁睁地看着
<8-7,Raj>I am embarrassed, so I eat all the lettuce in the world

231
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:16,730
<8-7,Raj>我吃光世界上所有的莴苣
<8-7,Raj>and make them watch.

232
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:20,030
<8-8,Leonard>别人可以昵称我安吉
<8-8,Leonard>People could call me Angie.

233
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:25,300
<8-8,Leonard>(史泰龙状)  哟  安吉  最近咋样
<8-8,Leonard>: Yo, Angie, how's it goin'?

234
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:28,470
<8-9,Howard>直到如今  每次一看到腌鲱鱼
<8-9,Howard>To this day, I can't look at pickled herring

235
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:31,530
<8-9,Howard>就会忍不住尴尬性奋
<8-9,Howard>without being aroused and ashamed.

236
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,130
<8-9,Howard>噢  珍妮阿姐
<8-9,Howard>Oh! Cousin Jeanie.

237
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:42,830
<9-1,Penny>你就不能开快点吗
<9-1,Penny>Could you please drive a little faster?

238
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,630
<9-2,Sheldon>我觉得已经够快了
<9-2,Sheldon>Oh, I think we're going sufficiently fast.

239
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,600
<9-2,Sheldon>什么情况
<9-2,Sheldon>What's that?

240
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,670
<9-3,Penny>没事  引擎时不时会这样
<9-3,Penny>Nothing. The engine does that sometimes.

241
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:51,830
<9-4,Sheldon>没事才怪
<9-4,Sheldon>It can't be nothing.

242
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,000
<9-4,Sheldon>检查引擎指示灯都亮了
<9-4,Sheldon>The check engine light is on.

243
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:54,400
<9-4,Sheldon>我们得去服务站
<9-4,Sheldon>We need to find a service station.

<9-5,Penny>自我买回这辆车  这灯就一直亮着
<9-5,Penny>No. The light has been on since I bought the car.

245
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,100
<9-6,Sheldon>那就更应该去了
<9-6,Sheldon>All the more reason

246
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:00,900
<9-6,Sheldon>趁这车爆炸之前  找维修师来处理
<9-6,Sheldon>to consult with a mechanic before it explodes.

247
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,200
<9-7,Penny>爆炸个鬼啊
<9-7,Penny>It's not going to explode.

00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:06,770
<9-7,Penny>曲速前进  史波克长官
<9-7,Penny>Warp speed ahead, Mr. Spock.

250
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:10,870
<9-8,Sheldon>史波克不是企业号的驾驶员
<9-8,Sheldon>Mr. Spock did not pilot the Enterprise.

251
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,600
<9-8,Sheldon>他是科学官  还有我保证
<9-8,Sheldon>He was the science officer, and I guarantee you that

252
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:16,200
<9-8,Sheldon>只要他看到企业号的检查引擎指示灯
<9-8,Sheldon>if he ever saw the Enterprise's check engine light blinking,

253
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:19,000
<9-8,Sheldon>闪那么一下  他会立刻下令靠边停
<9-8,Sheldon>he would pull the ship over immediately.

254
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:22,430
<9-9,Penny>老天  我的手臂完了
<9-9,Penny>Oh, God, I'm gonna lose the arm.

255
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,630
<9-10,Sheldon>红灯
<9-10,Sheldon>Oh, well, red light.

256
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,800
<9-10,Sheldon>先松开油门
<9-10,Sheldon>Release accelerator

257
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:29,930
<9-10,Sheldon>然后要慢慢地踩刹车
<9-10,Sheldon>and slowly apply... the... brake.

258
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:34,530
<9-10,Sheldon>搞定
<9-10,Sheldon>Nailed it.

259
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,630
<9-10,Sheldon>趁现在空着  能问你个问题吗
<9-10,Sheldon>While we have a moment, may I ask you a question?

260
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,030
<9-11,Penny>说
<9-11,Penny>What?

261
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,400
<9-12,Sheldon>你为什么在右屁股上
<9-12,Sheldon>Why do you have the Chinese character for soup

<9-12,Sheldon>纹了个中国字"汤"的纹身
<9-12,Sheldon>tattooed on your right buttock?

263
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:48,200
<9-13,Penny>那不是"汤"
<9-13,Penny>It's not soup.

264
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,500
<9-13,Penny>是"勇"
<9-13,Penny>It's courage.

265
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:50,970
<9-14,Sheldon>才不是
<9-14,Sheldon>No, it isn't.

266
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:53,200
<9-14,Sheldon>但我猜想  要表现出对汤的热忱
<9-14,Sheldon>But I suppose it does take courage

267
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:57,030
<9-14,Sheldon>还真是需要不少勇气
<9-14,Sheldon>to demonstrate that kind of commitment to soup.

268
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,970
<9-15,Penny>你怎么会看到
<9-15,Penny>How did you see it?

<9-16,Sheldon>不好意思
<9-16,Sheldon>Sorry.

271
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:04,930

00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,930
<13-2,Penny>等等  你得哄我上床睡觉啊
<13-2,Penny>Wait.You have to help me get into bed.

362
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:43,430
<13-2,Penny>谢尔顿哄我睡觉
<13-2,Penny>Sheldon has to get me into bed.

363
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:48,130
<13-2,Penny>我猜你怎么都想不到我会说这话
<13-2,Penny>Bet you never thought I'd say that.

364
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,200
<13-2,Penny>是啊
<13-2,Penny>Yes.

365
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,460
<13-3,Sheldon>你服下的药物副作用有无限可能
<13-3,Sheldon>The charm of your drug-addled candor knows no bounds.

366
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:00,600
<13-4,Penny>都说你跟个奇怪的机器人一样
<13-4,Penny>You know, people think you're this weird robot man

367
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:04,060
<13-4,Penny>一直都很烦人  说得一点没错
<13-4,Penny>who's so annoying all the time, and you totally are.

368
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:08,530
<13-4,Penny>但现在你就像电影《瓦力》里结局那样
<13-4,Penny>But then it's like that movie Wall-E at the end.

369
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,600
<13-4,Penny>充满了爱心
<13-4,Penny>You're so full of love,

370
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:13,000
<13-4,Penny>简直能拯救整个一株植物
<13-4,Penny>and you can save a plant

371
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:16,730
<13-4,Penny>拯救那些陷入滑滑椅不能自拔的肥佬
<13-4,Penny>and get fat people out of the floaty chairs.

372
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,460
<13-5,Sheldon>你这个比喻相当不伦不类
<13-5,Sheldon>That's a fairly labored metaphor,

373
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:21,900
<13-5,Sheldon>不过对这故事隐含的观点  我很欣赏
<13-5,Sheldon>but I appreciate the sentiment behind it.

374
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,130
<13-6,Penny>唱"乖乖猫"给我听
<13-6,Penny>Sing "Soft Kitty" to me.

375
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:30,760
<13-7,Sheldon>"乖乖猫"是唱给生病的人的
<13-7,Sheldon>"Soft Kitty" is for when you're sick.

376
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,000
<13-7,Sheldon>你又没生病
<13-7,Sheldon>You're not sick.

377
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:35,300
<13-8,Penny>我受伤了还服了药  就相当于生病
<13-8,Penny>Injured and drugged is a kind of sick.

378
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:50,600
<13-9,Sheldon (singing)>乖乖猫  暖暖猫  小小毛绒球
<13-9,Sheldon (singing)>Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur...

379
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:51,900
<13-9,Sheldon (singing)>等等
<13-9,Sheldon (singing)>Wait, wait.

380
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,960
<13-10,Penny>我们来唱和声吧
<13-10,Penny>Let's sing it as a round.

381

<13-9,Sheldon (singing)>我唱到这儿你该加进来唱了
<13-9,Sheldon (singing)>So, that's where you come in.

384
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,830
<13-10,Penny>我再从头唱起
<13-10,Penny>I'll start over.

385
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:15,000
<13-9,Sheldon (singing)>乖乖猫  暖暖猫  小小毛绒球
<13-9,Sheldon (singing)>Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur...

386
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,060
<13-10,Penny>谢尔顿  我有一整晚跟你耗哦
<13-10,Penny>I've got all night, Sheldon.

387

<13-9,Sheldon (singing)>乖乖猫  暖暖猫  小小毛绒球
<13-9,Sheldon (singing)>Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur...

<13-9,Sheldon (singing)>乖乖猫  暖暖猫  小小毛绒球
<13-9,Sheldon (singing)>Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur...

389
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,930
<13-10,Penny>快乐猫  瞌睡猫
<13-10,Penny>Happy kitty, sleepy kitty

390
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,300
<13-10,Penny>快乐猫  瞌睡猫
<13-10,Penny>Happy kitty, sleepy kitty

391
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,200
<13-10,Penny>呜  呜  呜[猫满足时呜呜的叫声]
<13-10,Penny>Purr, purr, purr

392
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:39,460
<13-10,Penny>呜  呜  呜
<13-10,Penny>Purr, purr, purr.

393
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,760
<14-1,Raj>第二天早上  他醒了过来
<14-1,Raj>...And the next morning when he woke up,

394
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:52,130
<14-1,Raj>翻了个身  他意识到...
<14-1,Raj>he rolled over and realized...

395
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,730
<14-1,Raj>那是她表妹
<14-1,Raj>...she was his cousin.

396
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,260
<14-2,Howard>还是不好笑
<14-2,Howard>That's still not funny.

397
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,530
<14-2,Howard>还是不好笑
<14-2,Howard>That's still not funny.

398
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:15,000
<14-4,Howard>再说她是我的远房表妹
<14-4,Howard>And she was my second cousin.

399
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,630
<14-4,Howard>再说她是我的远房表妹
<14-4,Howard>And she was my second cousin.

400
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,200
<14-6,Howard>你真是脑残
<14-6,Howard>You're a real douche.

401
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,660
<14-7,Raj>随你说好了  反正你跟自个儿表妹上床了
<14-7,Raj>Who cares? You slept with your cousin.
