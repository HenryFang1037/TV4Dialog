<1-5,Sheldon>肯尼亚衰落  乌干达雄起

<1-11,Sheldon>你说得对  我的错
<1-11,Sheldon>You're right. My apologies.

00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:57,460
<1-12,Leonard>你们俩在玩什么鬼游戏呢
<1-12,Leonard>What the hell are you guys playing?

00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,200
<1-13,Sheldon>这是我们发明的一个游戏
<1-13,Sheldon>It's a game we invented.

<1-13,Sheldon>我们称它为"反事实游戏"

<1-14,Amy>We postulate an alternate world that differs from ours

<1-15,Sheldon>本游戏适合8至80岁人士

<1-15,Sheldon>Join us.

27

<1-17,Sheldon>你走运了  这道简单
<1-17,Sheldon>You're in luck, this is an easy one.

31
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:21,290
<1-17,Sheldon>在一个人类被高智商巨形海狸统治的世界中
<1-17,Sheldon>In a world where mankind is ruled by a giant intelligent beaver,

32
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:23,750
<1-17,Sheldon>哪种食物再也吃不到了
<1-17,Sheldon>what food is no longer consumed?

33
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:28,660
<1-18,Leonard>BLT[培根生菜番茄三明治]吗  其中B代表海狸
<1-18,Leonard>Uh... a BLT where the "B" stands for beaver?

34
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:29,890
<1-18,Leonard>我也说不准
<1-18,Leonard>I don't know.

<1-20,Leonard>我能答出来的  让我想想
<1-20,Leonard>I can figure this out. Let's see.

38
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,600
<1-20,Leonard>海狸以树皮喂食
<1-20,Leonard>Um, well, beavers eat tree bark.

39
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,010
<1-20,Leonard>我唯一了解的人类用得着树皮的食物是肉桂
<1-20,Leonard>The only tree bark I know that humans consume is cinnamon.

40
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:44,310
<1-20,Leonard>所以我说是肉桂
<1-20,Leonard>So, I'll say cinnamon.

41
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,340
<1-21,Sheldon>错误
<1-21,Sheldon>Incorrect.

42
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:48,850
<1-21,Sheldon>答案很明显是芝士丹麦酥
<1-21,Sheldon>Obviously, the answer is cheese Danish.

43
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:50,180
<1-22,Leonard>你说啥
<1-22,Leonard>What?

44
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,920
<1-22,Leonard>在一个被巨形海狸统治的世界中
<1-22,Leonard>In a world ruled by a giant beaver,

<1-23,Amy>人类为取悦海狸的统治会修建许多水坝

<1-23,Amy>哥本哈根因地势低洼会遭遇洪灾
<1-23,Amy>The low-lying city of Copenhagen is flooded.

47
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,860
<1-23,Amy>数万人会死去
<1-23,Amy>Thousands die.

48
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:03,930
<1-23,Amy>更毁灭的是  丹麦人却从未以自己的名字给糕点命名
<1-23,Amy>Devastated, the Danes never invent their namesake pastry.

49
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:07,930
<1-23,Amy>怎么会有人连这个都想不到呢
<1-23,Amy>How does one miss that?

50
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,300
<1-24,Leonard>这太荒谬了
<1-24,Leonard>This is ridiculous.

51
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,840
<1-24,Leonard>你们这是在捏造答案
<1-24,Leonard>You're just making stuff up.

52
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,170
<1-25,Amy>他输的时候总这样吗
<1-25,Amy>Is he always like this when he loses?

53
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:16,570
<1-26,Sheldon>那当然了
<1-26,Sheldon>Oh, yes.

54
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:20,410
<1-26,Sheldon>你要是能目睹08年讨论巨形野牛时的景象就好了
<1-26,Sheldon>You should've been here for the great giant tantrum of 2008.

55
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:24,480
<1-27,Leonard>你掀的桌子  自己清楚
<1-27,Leonard>You bumped the table and you know it.

56
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,520
<1-28,Amy>或许我们应该玩个更适合他能力的游戏
<1-28,Amy>Perhaps it would be kinder to play a game more suited to his abilities.

57
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,330
<1-28,Amy>等会儿你躲猫猫的时候  我们会闭眼数到10
<1-28,Amy>We'll close our eyes and count to ten while you hide.

58
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,800
<1-29,Leonard>我回屋了
<1-29,Leonard>I'm going to my room.

59
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,660
<1-30,Amy>很好  莱纳德
<1-30,Amy>Very good, Leonard.

60
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:42,030
<1-30,Amy>但下次你藏哪里无需提前告诉我们
<1-30,Amy>But next time, don't tell us where you're hiding.

61
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:05,410
<1-30,Amy>生活大爆炸
<1-30,Amy>第四季第三集

62
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:14,500
<2-1,Leonard>你们看到《美国物理学报》关于超固体的论文了吗
<2-1,Leonard>Did you guys see the paper in The American Physics Journal on supersolids?

63
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,360
<2-1,Leonard>挺有趣的
<2-1,Leonard>It's pretty interesting.

64
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,940
<2-1,Leonard>这个人从假说...
<2-1,Leonard>This guy's working from a hypothesis where...

65
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,940
<2-2,Raj>剧透警报  剧透警报

<2-4,Raj>-咋了  -别提前爆料
<2-4,Raj>- What?  - Don't ruin it for me, man.

67
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:23,540
<2-4,Raj>我为了边蹲便壶边看把PDF文件都打出来了
<2-4,Raj>I printed out a PDF to read on the potty.

68
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,650
<2-5,Howard>便壶  你多大了  五岁吗
<2-5,Howard>On the potty? What are you, five?

69

<2-6,Raj>就是便便的地方嘛  不然你说该叫什么
<2-6,Raj>It's a potty. What do you call it?

70
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:28,650
<2-7,Howard>厕所
<2-7,Howard>Toilet.

71
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,780
<2-8,Raj>晚饭桌上这么叫不觉得有点粗俗了吗
<2-8,Raj>That's a little vulgar for the dinner table, don't you think?

72
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:32,890
<2-9,Howard>那"便壶"就不俗了吗
<2-9,Howard>Oh, and "potty" is okay?

73
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:35,020
<2-10,Raj>"便壶"多纯真  多可爱啊
<2-10,Raj>"Potty" is innocent. "Potty" is adorable.

74
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,790
<2-11,Howard>那你去便便的地方干啥  嘘嘘吗
<2-11,Howard>What do you do in the potty, wee-wee?

75
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:40,130
<2-12,Raj>如果我不必"嘣嘣"[大便]的话
<2-12,Raj>If I don't have to boom-boom.

76
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:42,500
<2-12,Raj>各位好
<2-12,Raj>Greetings.

77
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,670
<2-13,Sheldon>你们都记得艾米·菲拉·福勒吧
<2-13,Sheldon>You all remember Amy Farrah Fowler.

78
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:45,870
<2-15,Howard>-见到你很高兴  -你好
<2-15,Howard>- Nice to see you.  - Hello.

79
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,400
<2-17,Sheldon>抱歉我们迟到了
<2-17,Sheldon>Sorry we're late.

80
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,970
<2-18,Amy>对此我必须得承担责任
<2-18,Amy>I must take responsibility.

81
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,640
<2-18,Amy>我不得不半路上买点女性卫生用品
<2-18,Amy>I had to stop for feminine hygiene supplies.

82
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,810
<2-20,Leonard>-这样啊  -了解
<2-20,Leonard>- Aha.  - Okay.

83
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,970
<2-21,Sheldon>我认为她正在经期当中
<2-21,Sheldon>I believe she's experiencing her menses.

84
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,010
<2-22,Amy>实际上  还没到时候
<2-22,Amy>Actually, I'm not.

85
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:57,980
<2-22,Amy>但为了避免意外  我得时刻带着卫生巾
<2-22,Amy>In order to avoid surprises, I wear them all the time.

86
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,180
<2-23,Leonard>-理解  -非常了解
<2-23,Leonard>- Aha.  - Okay.

87
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,550
<2-24,Howard>厕所现在听起来顺耳多了是吧
<2-24,Howard>"Toilet's" sounding pretty good now, huh?

88
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:05,990
<2-25,Penny>瞧啊  这不是谢米嘛
<2-25,Penny>Hey, look, it's Shamy.

89
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:07,320
<2-26,Amy>谢米
<2-26,Amy>Shamy?

90
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,490
<2-27,Sheldon>一个幼稚地混合我们名字的做法而已
<2-27,Sheldon>A juvenile amalgamation of our names.

91
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:13,030
<2-27,Sheldon>谢尔顿  艾米  "谢米"
<2-27,Sheldon>Sheldon, Amy-- Shamy.

92
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:14,360
<2-27,Sheldon>这样啊
<2-27,Sheldon>Oh.

93
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,400
<2-28,Amy>我不喜欢  以后别这么叫了
<2-28,Amy>I don't like that. Don't do that.

94
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,500
<2-29,Penny>好吧  有什么新鲜事吗
<2-29,Penny>All righty. What's new?

95
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,300
<2-30,Amy>我刚才得知你称呼我们为"谢米"
<2-30,Amy>Well, just recently, I learned that you refer to us as Shamy,

96
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,300
<2-30,Amy>而我并不喜欢
<2-30,Amy>and I don't like that.

97
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:27,940
<2-31,Penny>我了解了  但我想问的其实是你生活上的新鲜事
<2-31,Penny>I got it. But what I was going for was, you know, how's your life?

98
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,740
<2-32,Amy>跟普通人没什么两样
<2-32,Amy>Like everybody else's.

99
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:32,880
<2-32,Amy>经历着万物的成长  衰败和最终的死亡
<2-32,Amy>Subject to entropy, decay and eventual death.

100
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,550
<2-32,Amy>谢谢你的问候
<2-32,Amy>Thank you for asking.

101
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,350
<2-32,Amy>为何她还没有给我们点餐呢
<2-32,Amy>Why is she not taking our order?

102
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,550
<2-33,Sheldon>我应该提前通知你的
<2-33,Sheldon>I should've warned you,

103
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:42,020
<2-33,Sheldon>如果想在这里用餐前  必须要经历连串
<2-33,Sheldon>one has to navigate a labyrinth of social nonsense

104
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,690
<2-33,Sheldon>繁杂而无用的寒暄
<2-33,Sheldon>before one can be fed here.

105
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:46,730
<2-34,Amy>是吗  我以为既然起名叫芝士"工厂"
<2-34,Amy>Really? I assumed an establishment called

106
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:49,530
<2-34,Amy>做事就能更有效率呢
<2-34,Amy>the Cheesecake Factory would function more efficiently.

107
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:50,830
<2-35,Sheldon>那是它们诱骗你来的伎俩
<2-35,Sheldon>It's how they lure you in.

108
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:53,100
<2-35,Sheldon>我想这应该称为"诱饵推销法"
<2-35,Sheldon>I believe it's called "bait and switch."

109
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:55,970
<2-36,Penny>好吧  我还是遁走好了
<2-36,Penny>Okay, I'm just gonna walk away,

110
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:58,070
<2-36,Penny>因为  我不想待在这了
<2-36,Penny>'cause... I don't want to be here.

111
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:04,010
<2-37,Leonard>这真不错啊
<2-37,Leonard>So, this is nice.

112
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:05,850
<2-37,Leonard>我们第一次齐聚一堂来吃顿饭
<2-37,Leonard>First time we've all gotten together to eat.

113
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:09,150
<2-38,Amy>你说得对  他果然在进行无聊的饭前寒暄
<2-38,Amy>You're right, he's a festival of humdrum chitchat.

114
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:12,120
<2-39,Leonard>好吧  我没辙了
<2-39,Leonard>Okay, that's all I got.

115
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,390
<2-39,Leonard>霍华德  你上
<2-39,Leonard>Howard, you're up.

116
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:17,890
<2-40,Howard>谈谈你的工作吧  艾米
<2-40,Howard>Um... tell us about your work, Amy.

117
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:19,590
<2-41,Amy>我怀疑你听不听得懂
<2-41,Amy>I doubt you'd understand.

118
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:22,330
<2-41,Amy>谢尔顿告诉我你只有个硕士学位
<2-41,Amy>Sheldon tells me you only have a master's degree.

119
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:26,730
<2-42,Howard>拉杰  你有没有问题问艾米
<2-42,Howard>Raj, do you have any questions for Amy?

120
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:33,140
<2-43,Amy>我很好奇  我们怎么不单独吃饭
<2-43,Amy>I'm curious as to why we're not eating alone.

121
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,210
<2-44,Sheldon>他们离不开我
<2-44,Sheldon>They can't function without me.

122
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:40,050
<2-44,Sheldon>我是凝聚这个小团体的粘合剂
<2-44,Sheldon>I'm the social glue that holds this little group together.

123
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:41,520
<2-44,Sheldon>不用谢我
<2-44,Sheldon>You're welcome.

124
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,790
<3-1,Leonard>我能跟你谈谈你的女朋友吗
<3-1,Leonard>Listen, can I talk to you about your girlfriend?

125
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:48,590
<3-2,Sheldon>她不是我的女朋友
<3-2,Sheldon>She's not my girlfriend.

126
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:50,520
<3-2,Sheldon>她是女生  也是我朋友
<3-2,Sheldon>She's a girl and she's my friend,

127
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:54,260
<3-2,Sheldon>但绝对没有触摸或不洁的交换唾液
<3-2,Sheldon>but there's no touching or unsanitary exchange of saliva.

128
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,130
<3-3,Leonard>明白
<3-3,Leonard>Got it.

129
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:59,100
<3-4,Sheldon>不过  倒是有一次
<3-4,Sheldon>Although, for the record, on one occasion,

130
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,740
<3-4,Sheldon>她舔了一下拇指  然后帮我抹掉
<3-4,Sheldon>she licked her thumb to remove raspberry jelly

131
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,600
<3-4,Sheldon>嘴角上的树莓果冻
<3-4,Sheldon>from the corner of my mouth.

132
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:06,010
<3-4,Sheldon>我们今天都为此后悔不已
<3-4,Sheldon>It's an action we both regret to this day.

133
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:07,110
<3-5,Leonard>明白
<3-5,Leonard>Uh-huh.

134
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:09,440
<3-5,Leonard>不过  我觉得她不太适合
<3-5,Leonard>Anyway, I'm not sure she's the best fit

135
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,080
<3-5,Leonard>我们这个  怎么说呢  反抗军[星球大战]
<3-5,Leonard>for our little-- how should we call it-- rebel alliance.

136
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,480
<3-6,Sheldon>我一直不认同反抗军
<3-6,Sheldon>Oh, I never identified with the rebel alliance.

137
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,890
<3-6,Sheldon>尽管他们想建造死亡星球
<3-6,Sheldon>Despite their tendency to build Death Stars,

138
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:21,150
<3-6,Sheldon>我一直支持银河帝国
<3-6,Sheldon>I've always been more of an empire man.

139
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,090
<3-7,Leonard>那不是我想说的
<3-7,Leonard>Yeah, not my point.

140
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:25,330
<3-8,Sheldon>我知道你想说什么
<3-8,Sheldon>I know what your point is.

141
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:27,360
<3-8,Sheldon>你们被艾米的智慧吓着了
<3-8,Sheldon>You're intimidated by Amy's intellect.

142
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,830
<3-8,Sheldon>我只能说  振作点
<3-8,Sheldon>To that I say, buck up.

143
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:32,130
<3-9,Leonard>我直接说吧
<3-9,Leonard>Okay, let me just get right to it.

144
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:35,470
<3-9,Leonard>艾米很爱批评人  假正经  而且
<3-9,Leonard>Amy is judgmental, sanctimonious and frankly...

145
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:38,740
<3-9,Leonard>很讨人厌
<3-9,Leonard>just obnoxious.

146
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,510
<3-10,Sheldon>那又如何
<3-10,Sheldon>So?

147
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,880
<3-11,Leonard>我们已经要忍受这样一个你了
<3-11,Leonard>So we already have you for all that.

148
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,480
<3-12,Sheldon>你这是建议我停止和艾米交往吗
<3-12,Sheldon>Are you suggesting I terminate my relationship with Amy?

149
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,880
<3-13,Leonard>不  当然不是
<3-13,Leonard>No, no, of course not.

150
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,990
<3-13,Leonard>只是去别的地方交往
<3-13,Leonard>Just have your relationship someplace else.

151
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:55,590
<3-14,Sheldon>那我可得指出  我忍气吞声整整八个月
<3-14,Sheldon>May I point out that for eight long months,

152
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:58,460
<3-15,Leonard>忍受你女朋友在咱家
<3-15,Leonard>I suffered in silence as your female companion

153
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:03,530
<3-14,Sheldon>大声唱跑调的乡村音乐
<3-14,Sheldon>filled our apartment with her off-key country music caterwauling,

154
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:07,210
<3-14,Sheldon>毫不知羞地在咱客厅
<3-14,Sheldon>the unappetizing spectacle of her grinding a pumice stone

155
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:10,270
<3-14,Sheldon>用浮石磨长满老茧的脚
<3-14,Sheldon>against her calloused feet in our living room,

156
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:12,250
<3-14,Sheldon>一夜接一夜地看
<3-14,Sheldon>and night after night of uninformative

157
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:16,210
<3-14,Sheldon>毫无内涵的电视剧《泽西海滩》
<3-14,Sheldon>TV documentaries about the Jersey Shore.

158
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:20,510
<3-15,Leonard>忍气吞声
<3-15,Leonard>Suffered in silence?

159
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,520
<3-15,Leonard>没错
<3-15,Leonard>Yes.

160
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:26,790
<3-16,Sheldon>我希望你也能这么做
<3-16,Sheldon>And I'd thank you to do the same.

161
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,720
<3-17,Leonard>有没有搞错  忍气吞声
<3-17,Leonard>Reall-- Silence?!

162
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,400
<4-1,Raj>落基山脉清凉的泉水
<4-1,Raj>Nothing makes beer taste better

163
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,300
<4-1,Raj>最能带出啤酒的味道
<4-1,Raj>than cool clear Rocky Mountain spring water.

164
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,400
<4-1,Raj>话说  落基山脉在哪啊
<4-1,Raj>Where are the Rocky Mountains, anyway?

165
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:47,070
<4-2,Howard>费城[实际不是]
<4-2,Howard>Philadelphia.

166
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,110
<4-2,Howard>真的吗
<4-2,Howard>Really?

167
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,540
<4-3,Raj>我以为在西部呢
<4-3,Raj>I thought they were out West someplace.

168
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,680
<4-4,Howard>这样想  拉杰
<4-4,Howard>Think about it, Raj.

169
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:54,050
<4-4,Howard>电影《洛奇》的故事发生在哪里
<4-4,Howard>Where did the movie Rocky take place?

170
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:56,620
<4-4,Howard>费城
<4-4,Howard>Philadelphia.

171
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,590
<4-5,Raj>我明白了
<4-5,Raj>Okay, now I get it.

172
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:01,150
<4-6,Penny>这就是咱的计划吗
<4-6,Penny>So this is the plan?

173
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,610
<4-6,Penny>从今天起
<4-6,Penny>From now on,

174
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:05,290
<4-6,Penny>我们就藏这里躲避谢米吗
<4-6,Penny>we're just gonna hide out in here to avoid the Shamy?

175
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:06,890
<4-7,Raj>我觉得这里很舒服
<4-7,Raj>I'm very comfortable here.

176
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:11,430
<4-7,Raj>佩妮亲爱的  再给我来一剂"万灵弹"吧
<4-7,Raj>Penny, dear, why don't you shoot another silver bullet my way?

177
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:13,470
<4-8,Penny>自己拿去
<4-8,Penny>Get one yourself.

178
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:16,740
<4-9,Raj>某人吃了泼妇药哦
<4-9,Raj>Ooh, somebody's been taking bitchy pills.

179
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:20,370
<4-10,Penny>老天  他喝了酒真混蛋
<4-10,Penny>God, he's an ass when he drinks.

180
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,740
<4-10,Penny>他没喝酒也混蛋
<4-10,Penny>Oh, he's an ass when he doesn't.

181
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,940
<4-11,Howard>你只是没听到
<4-11,Howard>You just don't hear it.

182
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:26,880
<4-12,Leonard>我们得考虑谢米恋
<4-12,Leonard>Think we need to start entertaining the possibility

183
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,750
<4-12,Leonard>发展数年的可能性
<4-12,Leonard>that the Shamy could go on for years.

184
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,450
<4-13,Raj>那样的话  佩妮得装卫星电视
<4-13,Raj>Well, if that's the case, Penny will have to get satellite TV

185
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:34,150
<4-13,Raj>而且每周吸一吸灰尘
<4-13,Raj>and maybe once a week run a vacuum through this place.

186
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,190
<4-14,Penny>你不是要跟谢尔顿谈吗
<4-14,Penny>I thought you were going to talk to Sheldon.

187
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:42,060
<4-16,Penny>-谈了  -他怎么说
<4-16,Penny>- I did.  - Well, what'd he say?

188
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:44,200
<4-17,Leonard>他指出他过去有点必须
<4-17,Leonard>Well, he pointed out that he kinda sorta had to...

189
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,670
<4-17,Leonard>忍受你
<4-17,Leonard>put up with you.

190
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,630
<4-18,Penny>有点必须
<4-18,Penny>Kinda sorta had to?

191
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,940
<4-19,Leonard>我没同意他的说法
<4-19,Leonard>I didn't agree with him.

192
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:49,940
<4-20,Penny>你帮我反驳了吧
<4-20,Penny>Well, you defended me, right?

193
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,770
<4-21,Leonard>我试了  不过
<4-21,Leonard>I tried, but...

194
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:59,600
<4-21,Leonard>他说的理由太充分了
<4-21,Leonard>...he made a fairly well-reasoned argument.

195
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,870
<4-22,Howard>你磨得不对
<4-22,Howard>You're not doing that right.

196
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:03,870
<4-23,Penny>什么
<4-23,Penny>What?

197
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,100
<4-24,Howard>给我
<4-24,Howard>Gimme.

198
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:06,340
<4-26,Howard>-不要  -相信我
<4-26,Howard>- No.  - Trust me.

199
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:09,040
<4-27,Penny>-不要  -我一直帮我妈磨脚
<4-27,Penny>- No!  - I do this for my mom all the time.

200
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,210
<4-27,Penny>看到没
<4-27,Penny>See?

201
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:14,350
<4-28,Howard>要顺着纹路摩
<4-28,Howard>With the grain.

202
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:16,950
<4-29,Penny>哇  确实好很多
<4-29,Penny>Wow, that is better.

203
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:19,390
<4-30,Howard>改天  你要是得了静脉曲张
<4-30,Howard>And someday, when you have varicose veins,

204
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:21,290
<4-30,Howard>我再教你怎么推拿
<4-30,Howard>I'll show you how to massage them.

205
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,270
<5-1,Raj>天呐  没有下次了
<5-1,Raj>Oh, God, never again.

206
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:31,240
<5-2,Leonard>你的"没有下次"应该是指不再
<5-2,Leonard>I assume by "never again," you mean never again will you drink

207
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,640
<5-2,Leonard>喝完佩妮的啤酒后跑去加油站
<5-2,Leonard>all of Penny's beer, then run down to the gas station

208
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,840
<5-2,Leonard>买两瓶40s啤酒  一盒肉条
<5-2,Leonard>for a couple of 40s, a box of Slim Jims

209
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:39,780
<5-2,Leonard>还有最新一期的《孟买美妞翘臀》吧
<5-2,Leonard>and the latest issue of Bombay Badonkadonks.

210
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:42,950
<5-3,Raj>人家想家了嘛
<5-3,Raj>I was homesick.

211
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:45,050
<5-4,Howard>当晚最精彩的就是你展示
<5-4,Howard>The highlight of the evening was when you showed us

212
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:47,150
<5-4,Howard>你的宝莱坞霹雳舞技
<5-4,Howard>your Bollywood break dancing skills.

213
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:56,900
<5-5,Raj>你这样很没礼貌
<5-5,Raj>That's very offensive.

214
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,000
<5-6,Howard>没错  我们当时也这么想
<5-6,Howard>Yeah, we all thought so.

215
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,300
<5-7,Leonard>晕
<5-7,Leonard>Oh, no.

216
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,300
<5-8,Howard>怎么了
<5-8,Howard>What?

217
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,670
<5-9,Leonard>约翰和洋子来了[列侬夫妇]
<5-9,Leonard>It's John and Yoko.

218
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:07,410
<5-10,Howard>更像洋子和洋子
<5-10,Howard>More like Yoko and Yoko.

219
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:09,110
<5-11,Sheldon>大家好
<5-11,Sheldon>Greetings. Hey.

220
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,030
<5-13,Sheldon>我带了艾米来
<5-13,Sheldon>I brought Amy here

221
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:12,270
<5-13,Sheldon>看看我的工作
<5-13,Sheldon>to show her some of the work I'm doing.

222
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:14,670
<5-14,Amy>对于理论工作来说  很不错了
<5-14,Amy>It's very impressive, for theoretical work.

223
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,810
<5-15,Sheldon>我好像察觉出一点屈就的意味
<5-15,Sheldon>Do I detect a hint of condescension?

224
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:21,010
<5-16,Amy>抱歉  我说得太间接了吗
<5-16,Amy>I'm sorry, was I being too subtle?

225
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,450
<5-16,Amy>我是指跟神经生物学
<5-16,Amy>I meant compared to the real-world applications

226
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:26,480
<5-16,Amy>在现实中的应用相比  理论物理就是
<5-16,Amy>of neurobiology, theoretical physics is--

227
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,680
<5-16,Amy>怎么说好呢  小巫见大巫
<5-16,Amy>what's the word I'm looking for?-- hmm, cute.

228
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:34,390
<5-18,Sheldon>你这是暗指神经生物学家的成就
<5-18,Sheldon>Are you suggesting the work of a neurobiologist

229
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:37,760
<5-18,Sheldon>例如巴宾斯基  能上升到物理学家
<5-18,Sheldon>like Babinski could ever rise to the significance

231
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,100
<5-18,Sheldon>例如克拉克·麦克斯韦或狄拉克的层面
<5-18,Sheldon>of a physicist like Clark Maxwell or Dirac?

233
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,800
<5-19,Amy>直截了当地说
<5-19,Amy>I'm stating it outright.

234
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,800
<5-19,Amy>巴宾斯基把狄拉克当早餐
<5-19,Amy>Babinski eats Dirac for breakfast

235
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,700
<5-19,Amy>再排泄出克拉克·麦克斯韦
<5-19,Amy>and defecates Clarke-Maxwell.

236
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,710
<5-20,Sheldon>你给我收回那话
<5-20,Sheldon>You take that back.

237
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,580
<5-21,Amy>绝不
<5-21,Amy>Absolutely not.

238
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,810
<5-21,Amy>我和同事们正在绘制
<5-21,Amy>My colleagues and I are mapping

239
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:57,780
<5-21,Amy>神经基质  有利于
<5-21,Amy>the neurological substrates that subserve

240
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:58,950
<5-21,Amy>促进全球信息处理
<5-21,Amy>global information processing,

241
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:01,050
<5-21,Amy>这种研究既要求认知推理
<5-21,Amy>which is required for all cognitive reasoning,

242
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:04,750
<5-21,Amy>也包括科学探索  由此事实可见
<5-21,Amy>including scientific inquiry, making my research ipso facto

243
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,090
<5-21,Amy>我的研究在认知序列上更高一层
<5-21,Amy>prior in the ordo cognoscendi.

244
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:08,790
<5-21,Amy>这就说明比他的研究更高级
<5-21,Amy>That means it's better than his research,

245
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,790
<5-21,Amy>由此可推  当然也胜过你们
<5-21,Amy>and by extension, of course, yours.

246
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:15,600
<5-22,Leonard>不好意思  我的大脑
<5-22,Leonard>I'm sorry, I'm-I'm still trying

247
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,900
<5-22,Leonard>还停留在理解排泄克拉克·麦克斯韦上
<5-22,Leonard>to work on the defecating Clark Maxwell, so...

248
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:24,440
<5-23,Sheldon>不好意思  但是统一场理论
<5-23,Sheldon>Excuse me, but a grand unified theory,

249
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,010
<5-23,Sheldon>在一定程度上解释了万物
<5-23,Sheldon>insofar as it explains everything,

250
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:30,080
<5-23,Sheldon>由此事实可见  也能解释神经生物学
<5-23,Sheldon>will ipso facto explain neurobiology.

251
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,680
<5-24,Amy>是没错  但要是我成功了
<5-24,Amy>Yes, but if I'm successful,

252
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,180
<5-24,Amy>我就能绘制和再现你演算出
<5-24,Amy>I will be able to map and reproduce your thought processes

253
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:36,090
<5-24,Amy>统一场理论的思维加工过程
<5-24,Amy>in deriving a grand unified theory,

254
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:38,950
<5-24,Amy>因此  你的结论也得纳入我的范式
<5-24,Amy>and therefore, subsume your conclusions under my paradigm.

255
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,490
<5-25,Sheldon>那是卑劣的心理主义
<5-25,Sheldon>That's the rankest psychologism,

256
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:44,890
<5-25,Sheldon>早在19世纪90年代就被费雷格
<5-25,Sheldon>and was conclusively revealed as hogwash

257
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,030
<5-25,Sheldon>板上钉钉为是胡言乱语
<5-25,Sheldon>by Gottlob Frege in the 1890s!

258
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:50,130
<5-26,Amy>看来我们陷入了僵局
<5-26,Amy>We appear to have reached an impasse.

259
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:51,800
<5-27,Sheldon>同意
<5-27,Sheldon>I agree.

260
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,440
<5-27,Sheldon>我决定立即终止我俩的关系
<5-27,Sheldon>I move our relationship terminate immediately.

261
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,440
<5-28,Amy>赞同
<5-28,Amy>Seconded.

262
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,540
<5-29,Sheldon>还有异议吗
<5-29,Sheldon>There being no objections...

263
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,980
<5-31,Sheldon>那么立即执行
<5-31,Sheldon>...the motion carries.

264
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,950
<5-31,Sheldon>日安  艾米·菲拉·福勒
<5-31,Sheldon>Good day, Amy Farrah Fowler.

265
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:06,950
<5-32,Amy>日安  谢尔顿·库珀
<5-32,Amy>Good day, Sheldon Cooper.

266
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,960
<5-33,Howard>女人哈
<5-33,Howard>Women, huh?

267
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,490
<5-33,Howard>没法和她们过日子
<5-33,Howard>Can't live with them,

268
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:17,890
<5-33,Howard>也没法反驳她们的各种假设
<5-33,Howard>can't successfully refute their hypotheses.

269
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:20,060
<5-34,Sheldon>上帝保佑
<5-34,Sheldon>Amen to that.

270
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,970
<6-1,Penny>好呀  谢尔顿
<6-1,Penny>Hey, Sheldon.

271
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:29,610
<6-2,Sheldon>你好
<6-2,Sheldon>Hello.

272
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:33,340
<6-3,Penny>听说你和艾米分手了
<6-3,Penny>I hear you broke up with Amy.

273
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:37,780
<6-3,Penny>说"分手"的话就说明她是我女朋友
<6-3,Penny>A breakup would imply she was my girlfriend.

274
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,380
<6-4,Sheldon>她是个女孩  曾经是我朋友
<6-4,Sheldon>She was a girl who was my friend

275
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:42,820
<6-4,Sheldon>现在她还是个女孩  但不是我朋友了
<6-4,Sheldon>who is now a girl who is not my friend.

276
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:46,420
<6-5,Penny>听着像史上最烂乡村民谣
<6-5,Penny>Wow. That's like the worst country song ever.

277
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,690
<6-5,Penny>你感觉如何
<6-5,Penny>So, how are you doing?

278
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,960
<6-6,Sheldon>什么感觉
<6-6,Sheldon>Regarding what?

279
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,100
<6-7,Penny>和艾米分手
<6-7,Penny>Amy.

280
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,200
<6-8,Sheldon>我不懂
<6-8,Sheldon>I don't follow.

281
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:00,440
<6-9,Penny>分手...不管你怎么叫  总是很难受的
<6-9,Penny>Well, breakups-- or whatever the hell this is-- can be tough.

282
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,440
<6-10,Sheldon>佩妮  放心  我没事
<6-10,Sheldon>Penny, I assure you, I'm fine.

283
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,610
<6-10,Sheldon>我和艾米只是纯粹智力上的关系
<6-10,Sheldon>My relationship with Amy was purely intellectual,

284
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:08,050
<6-10,Sheldon>没有丝毫感情色彩
<6-10,Sheldon>There were no emotional bonds,

285
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:10,380
<6-10,Sheldon>所以我也没有任何痛苦
<6-10,Sheldon>the severing of which would cause me any discomfort.

286
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:13,050
<6-10,Sheldon>这段关系只是失去效用罢了
<6-10,Sheldon>The relationship simply outlived its utility,

287
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:16,020
<6-10,Sheldon>我也像从前一样继续生活
<6-10,Sheldon>and I'm continuing on with my life as before.

288
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,920
<6-11,Penny>好吧  不错
<6-11,Penny>Okay. Good.

289
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,760
<6-12,Sheldon>我得先走了  要去买一只小猫咪
<6-12,Sheldon>Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to buy a pussycat.

290
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,630
<7-1,Leonard>这事儿必须跟你们说一下
<7-1,Leonard>I gotta tell you guys,

291
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,200
<7-2,Howard>我有点担心谢尔顿
<7-2,Howard>I'm a little worried about Sheldon.

292
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,030
<7-2,Howard>我们都有点担心谢尔顿
<7-2,Howard>We're all a little worried about Sheldon.

293
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,070
<7-3,Leonard>我是说自从谢米恋搁浅后
<7-3,Leonard>No, I mean since the Shamy hit a reef.

294
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:35,340
<7-4,Howard>我还以为你是一概而论呢
<7-4,Howard>Oh, I thought you were just making a generalization:

295
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,770
<7-4,Howard>"我担心谢尔顿  可能他某天"
<7-4,Howard>"You know, I'm worried about Sheldon

296
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,980
<7-4,Howard>会因为在咖啡馆吃不到酸橙果冻
<7-4,Howard>"someday setting off a low-yield nuclear device

297
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,710
<7-4,Howard>就去引爆一个低爆炸力核装置
<7-4,Howard>because the cafeteria ran out of lime Jell-O."

298
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:44,110
<7-5,Raj>搁浅是啥意思
<7-5,Raj>What does "hit a reef" mean?

299
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,650
<7-6,Leonard>一拍两散
<7-6,Leonard>Uh, went splitsville.

300
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:46,650
<7-7,Raj>啥
<7-7,Raj>Pardon?

301
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:49,220
<7-8,Leonard>就是"屎了"
<7-8,Leonard>Turned to boom-boom.

302
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:53,460
<7-10,Leonard>我觉得谢尔顿真的很想念艾米
<7-10,Leonard>I think Sheldon really misses Amy.

303
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:57,730
<7-11,Howard>你该把你的那本《孟买美妞翘臀》借给他
<7-11,Howard>You should lend him your copy of Bombay Badonkadonks.

304
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:59,900
<7-12,Leonard>他找了只猫作伴
<7-12,Leonard>He got a cat to keep him company.

305
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:00,900
<7-13,Raj>不是吧
<7-13,Raj>You're kidding.

306
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,170
<7-14,Leonard>他上哪儿都带着
<7-14,Leonard>He takes it everywhere:

307
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:04,000
<7-14,Leonard>不管是卧室还是洗手间
<7-14,Leonard>to bed, to the bathroom.

308
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,970
<7-15,Raj>他带猫咪用便壶吗
<7-15,Raj>He takes the kitty to the potty?

309
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,570
<7-16,Howard>我们不是说好不用这词儿了么
<7-16,Howard>I thought we discussed the P-word.

310
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:10,140
<7-17,Raj>别想着改变我  老兄
<7-17,Raj>Don't try to change me, dude.

311
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,140
<7-17,Raj>哥就是哥
<7-17,Raj>I am what I am.

312
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:15,450
<7-18,Sheldon>先生们
<7-18,Sheldon>Oh, gentlemen.

313
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:17,510
<7-19,Howard>不给我们介绍下
<7-19,Howard>Hey. Aren't you going to introduce us

314
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,180
<7-19,Howard>你的小伙伴吗
<7-19,Howard>to your little friend?

315
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,650
<7-19,Howard>不好意思
<7-19,Howard>My apologies.

316
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:25,420
<7-20,Sheldon>拉杰  霍华德  这位是罗伯特·奥本海默博士
<7-20,Sheldon>Raj, Howard, I'd like you to meet Dr. Robert Oppenheimer.

317
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:28,690
<7-22,Raj>你好
<7-22,Raj>Hello. Hi.

318
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:29,960
<7-22,Raj>失陪一下
<7-22,Raj>Now, if you'll excuse me,

319
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:33,500
<7-23,Sheldon>原子弹之父现在要来一碟牛奶
<7-23,Sheldon>the father of the atomic bomb wants a saucer of milk.

320
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:37,600
<7-24,Howard>我懂了  的确该担心谢尔顿
<7-24,Howard>Okay, I get it. We're worried about Sheldon.

321
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,070
<7-25,Leonard>是吧
<7-25,Leonard>Yeah.

322
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:43,910
<7-25,Leonard>回来了
<7-25,Leonard>Hey.

323
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:46,440
<8-1,Leonard>不是吧
<8-1,Leonard>Oh, no.

324
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,050
<8-2,Sheldon>奥本海默太孤单了
<8-2,Sheldon>Robert Oppenheimer was lonely.

325
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:52,580
<8-3,Leonard>所以你要把整个曼哈顿计划的人都找来吗
<8-3,Leonard>So you decided to get the whole Manhattan Project?

327
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:55,620
<8-4,Sheldon>对  这位是恩里科·费米  理查德·费曼
<8-4,Sheldon>Yes. This is Enrico Fermi, Richard Feynman,

328
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:56,690
<8-4,Sheldon>爱德华·泰勒
<8-4,Sheldon>Edward Teller,

329
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:58,020
<8-4,Sheldon>奥托·弗里希
<8-4,Sheldon>Otto Frisch

330
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,890
<8-4,Sheldon>还有犀利哥
<8-4,Sheldon>and Zazzles.

331
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:01,990
<8-5,Leonard>什么鬼名字
<8-5,Leonard>Zazzles?

332
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:04,830
<8-6,Sheldon>我本想给他取名为赫尔曼·冯·赫尔姆霍兹
<8-6,Sheldon>I was going to name him Hermann von Helmholtz,

333
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:07,360
<8-6,Sheldon>但他实在太犀利了
<8-6,Sheldon>but he's so zazzy.

334
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,540
<8-7,Leonard>好吧  我们得谈谈
<8-7,Leonard>Okay, we need to talk.

335
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,770
<8-8,Sheldon>谈什么
<8-8,Sheldon>About what?

336
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:15,410
<8-9,Leonard>猫呗  谢尔顿
<8-9,Leonard>Cats, Sheldon.

337
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:17,410
<8-9,Leonard>显然艾米走后  你很难受
<8-9,Leonard>You're clearly upset about Amy being gone,

338
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:20,110
<8-9,Leonard>所以你想用一堆猫来代替她
<8-9,Leonard>and you're trying to replace her with a bunch of cats.

339
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:21,710
<8-10,Sheldon>-一群猫  -啥
<8-10,Sheldon>- Clowder. - What?

340
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:25,080
<8-12,Sheldon>不用一堆  而要用一群  或者是一窝子
<8-12,Sheldon>A group of cats is a clowder. Or a glaring.

341
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,120
<8-13,Leonard>好吧  我懂了
<8-13,Leonard>Okay, yeah, fine.

342
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,820
<8-14,Sheldon>既然我们现在与猫为伍
<8-14,Sheldon>It's the kind of thing you ought to know

343
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,490
<8-14,Sheldon>我觉得有必要给你扫盲一下
<8-14,Sheldon>now that we have one.

344
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:32,760
<8-15,Leonard>很好很强大  我的意思是
<8-15,Leonard>Terrific. My point is, you need to face up

345
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,730
<8-15,Leonard>你得坦然面对这次分手
<8-15,Leonard>to what you're feeling with this breakup.

346
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:35,960
<8-16,Sheldon>这不是分手
<8-16,Sheldon>It wasn't a breakup.

347
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,860
<8-16,Sheldon>那样的话就说明她是我女朋友
<8-16,Sheldon>A breakup would imply that Amy was my girlfriend.

348
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:40,400
<8-17,Leonard>好吧  我知道了  她不是你女朋友
<8-17,Leonard>Okay, I got it, I got it; she's not your girlfriend.

349
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,770
<8-17,Leonard>听我说
<8-17,Leonard>Now listen to me.

350
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:45,340
<8-17,Leonard>我知道孤单一人的感觉
<8-17,Leonard>I know about loneliness.

351
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,670
<8-17,Leonard>也明白要借其它事物来寻求安慰
<8-17,Leonard>I know about trying to replace someone with other stuff.

352
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:50,570
<8-17,Leonard>我那会和佩妮分手后  我又重新开始拉大提琴
<8-17,Leonard>When I broke up with Penny, I got back into my cello,

353
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,680
<8-17,Leonard>还搭了不少模型火箭
<8-17,Leonard>I built a bunch of model rockets,

354
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:57,210
<8-17,Leonard>我还买了举重手套和五磅重的哑铃
<8-17,Leonard>I got those weightlifting gloves and that five-pound dumbbell.

355
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:00,580
<8-18,Sheldon>你那不叫分手  是佩妮甩了你
<8-18,Sheldon>You didn't break up, she dumped you.

356
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:02,520
<8-19,Leonard>她才没甩了我
<8-19,Leonard>She didn't dump me.

357
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,920
<8-19,Leonard>这是互相的
<8-19,Leonard>It was mutual!

358
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,590
<8-20,Sheldon>我就在场  是她甩了你
<8-20,Sheldon>I was there. She dumped you.

359

00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:10,890
<8-21,Leonard>她就跟几十只猫一起住
<8-21,Leonard>She had dozens of them.

363
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,360
<8-21,Leonard>你知道她死后怎么样了吗  猫把她给吃了
<8-21,Leonard>And do you know what happened after she died? They ate her.

364
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,030
<8-22,Sheldon>不用再跟说服我喜欢猫了  莱纳德
<8-22,Sheldon>You don't have to sell me on cats, Leonard.

00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,270
<8-22,Sheldon>我已经喜欢了

368
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:28,910
<8-22,Sheldon>这可一点都不喜人
<8-22,Sheldon>Well, that's not fancy at all.

00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,930
<9-7,Leonard>不  不是那样的

380
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,670
<9-7,Leonard>但有些事  请你作好心理准备

<9-8,Mrs Cooper>没什么能让我吃惊的了
<9-8,Mrs Cooper>There's nothing he can do that'll surprise me.

<9-15,Mrs Cooper>你养了很多猫
<9-15,Mrs Cooper>You got a lot of cats

393
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,480
<9-15,Mrs Cooper>还给它们起了可爱的犹太名字
<9-15,Mrs Cooper>and you gave 'em cute Jewish names.

394
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,350
<9-16,Sheldon>你来这干嘛
<9-16,Sheldon>What are you doing here?

395
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:36,580
<9-17,Mrs Cooper>莱纳德打电话给我的
<9-17,Mrs Cooper>Leonard called.

396
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:39,820
<9-17,Mrs Cooper>他说你为伊人消得人憔悴
<9-17,Mrs Cooper>And he said that you were pining for a young lady.

397
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,620
<9-18,Sheldon>那太可笑了
<9-18,Sheldon>Oh, that's preposterous.

398
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,650
<9-18,Sheldon>我才没有为谁憔悴
<9-18,Sheldon>I'm not pining over anyone.

399
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:46,760
<9-19,Mrs Cooper>哦小羊排  我的说法或许不合适
<9-19,Mrs Cooper>Oh, lambchop, we can quibble what to call it,

400
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:50,330
<9-19,Mrs Cooper>但我们都同意  这事儿让人毛骨悚然
<9-19,Mrs Cooper>but I think we can both agree it's creepy.

401
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:52,430
<9-20,Sheldon>我才不同意
<9-20,Sheldon>I do not agree.

402
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:54,800
<9-20,Sheldon>猫是很好的伙伴
<9-20,Sheldon>Cats make wonderful companions.

403
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:59,070
<9-20,Sheldon>不会跟你吵  也不会质疑你的才智权威
<9-20,Sheldon>They don't argue or question my intellectual authority,

404
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,940
<9-20,Sheldon>还有这个小家伙
<9-20,Sheldon>and this little guy here,

405
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:04,210
<9-20,Sheldon>你们会发现它实在太犀利了
<9-20,Sheldon>I think you'll find to be quite zazzy.

406
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:08,980
<9-21,Mrs Cooper>你真该早点打给我的
<9-21,Mrs Cooper>You should have called sooner.

<10-5,Mrs Cooper>我打给她的
<10-5,Mrs Cooper>I called her.

412
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:23,930
<10-6,Amy>你妈妈认为
<10-6,Amy>Your mother thinks

413
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:25,900
<10-6,Amy>你可能正因我失魂落魄
<10-6,Amy>you might be losing your mind over me.

414
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,530
<10-6,Amy>作为神经生物学家  我很好奇
<10-6,Amy>As a neurobiologist, I was curious.

415
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:32,240
<10-7,Sheldon>放心  我心智完全正常
<10-7,Sheldon>Well, rest assured, I am in full possession of my faculties.

416
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,340
<10-8,Leonard (pretending to sneeze)>25只猫
<10-8,Leonard (pretending to sneeze)>25 cats!

417
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:38,640
<10-9,Mrs Cooper>上帝保佑你  亲爱的
<10-9,Mrs Cooper>Oh, God bless you, dear.

418
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,010
<10-9,Mrs Cooper>谢尔顿  坐下  我们谈谈
<10-9,Mrs Cooper>Sheldon, sit down. Let's talk.

419
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:43,810
<10-10,Sheldon>好吧  但不许骗我
<10-10,Sheldon>All right, but you're not fooling me.

420
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,050
<10-10,Sheldon>每次你说我们谈谈
<10-10,Sheldon>Whenever you say we have to talk,

421
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:46,280
<10-10,Sheldon>都只许你说我听
<10-10,Sheldon>it means you want me to listen.

422
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,280
<10-11,Mrs Cooper>那就闭嘴
<10-11,Mrs Cooper>Then stop talking.

423
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:49,090
<10-12,Sheldon>是  长官
<10-12,Sheldon>Yes, ma'am.

424
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:51,190
<10-13,Mrs Cooper>我找艾米过来的原因
<10-13,Mrs Cooper>Now, the reason I called Amy over was

425
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:53,760
<10-13,Mrs Cooper>是想看看她是哪种人
<10-13,Mrs Cooper>to find out what type of person she is.

426
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,430
<10-13,Mrs Cooper>跟她聊了一会后
<10-13,Mrs Cooper>And after chatting a bit,

427
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:57,760
<10-13,Mrs Cooper>我不得不说  虽然她是个
<10-13,Mrs Cooper>I have to say that while she is a

428
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,270
<10-13,Mrs Cooper>绝对  特殊的女士
<10-13,Mrs Cooper>perfectly unique young woman,

429
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:04,770
<10-13,Mrs Cooper>你们俩完全不适合对方
<10-13,Mrs Cooper>you two are definitely not suited for each other.

430
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:07,570
<10-14,Sheldon>这结论真奇怪
<10-14,Sheldon>That's a peculiar conclusion.

431
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:10,040
<10-14,Sheldon>不管以任何标准来衡量  艾米都比我认识的任何人
<10-14,Sheldon>By any standard, Amy is more similar to me

432
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,340
<10-14,Sheldon>跟我更像
<10-14,Sheldon>than anyone I've ever met.

433
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:14,140
<10-15,Mrs Cooper>抱歉谢利  我看不出来
<10-15,Mrs Cooper>Oh, I'm sorry, Shelly, I can't see it.

434
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:17,050
<10-16,Sheldon>你看不看得出来没关系
<10-16,Sheldon>Well, whether you see it or not is irrelevant.

435
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:19,050
<10-16,Sheldon>我也看不到亚原子粒子
<10-16,Sheldon>I can't see subatomic particles,

436
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:20,920
<10-16,Sheldon>但不论任何  它们就是存在的
<10-16,Sheldon>but nevertheless, they're there.

437
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,020
<10-17,Amy>绝妙的观点
<10-17,Amy>Excellent point.

438
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,750
<10-18,Sheldon>且是物理学观点
<10-18,Sheldon>A physics point.

439
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,290
<10-19,Amy>讲得好
<10-19,Amy>Touche

440
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,630
<10-20,Mrs Cooper>别卖弄拉丁话了
<10-20,Mrs Cooper>Well, putting aside the pig Latin,

441
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:30,460
<10-20,Mrs Cooper>很高兴看到
<10-20,Mrs Cooper>it's a good thing that

442
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,430
<10-20,Mrs Cooper>你们决定分手
<10-20,Mrs Cooper>you two decided to end the relationship

443
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:34,870
<10-20,Mrs Cooper>就省得我来拆散你们了
<10-20,Mrs Cooper>so I didn't have to end it for you.

444
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:38,900
<10-21,Sheldon>艾米  再三考虑之后
<10-21,Sheldon>Amy, after consideration,

445
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,100
<10-21,Sheldon>我觉得我们可能决定得太草率了
<10-21,Sheldon>I believe we may have acted rashly.

446
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,970
<10-21,Sheldon>我建议我们重新开始
<10-21,Sheldon>I propose we resume our relationship

447
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:45,480
<10-21,Sheldon>并尝试解决双方差异的障碍
<10-21,Sheldon>and attempt to resolve our differences.

448
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,410
<10-22,Amy>除非你认可  我俩之间
<10-22,Amy>I'll agree to that only if you'll stipulate

449
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:49,510
<10-22,Amy>80%的障碍都是你造成的
<10-22,Amy>that 80% of our difficulties were caused by you.

450
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:51,320
<10-23,Sheldon>-我只认可占40%  -你占65%
<10-23,Sheldon>- I'll go as high as 40. - Sixty-five.

451
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,850
<10-25,Sheldon>成交
<10-25,Sheldon>Done.

452
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:54,850
<10-25,Sheldon>你明白我们继续的话
<10-25,Sheldon>You understand that moving forward,

453
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:58,320
<10-25,Sheldon>我们得面对我妈并不认可你的现实
<10-25,Sheldon>we deal with the fact that my mother does not approve of you?

454
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,290
<10-26,Amy>我明白  我发现扮演个
<10-26,Amy>I do. I find being cast

455
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:03,990
<10-26,Amy>坏女孩的角色  竟让我很兴奋
<10-26,Amy>in the role of bad girl oddly titillating.

456
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:07,400
<10-27,Sheldon>想看看我的猫吗
<10-27,Sheldon>Would you like to see my cats?

457
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,530
<10-28,Amy>想  我喜欢猫
<10-28,Amy>I would. I love cats.

458
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:10,870
<10-28,Amy>它们是独善其身的典范
<10-28,Amy>They're the epitome of indifference.

459
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:14,670
<10-29,Sheldon>你会发现犀利哥有点烦人
<10-29,Sheldon>Ah, then you may find Zazzles a little cloying.

460
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,540
<10-30,Leonard>我可算看出来了
<10-30,Leonard>I saw what you did there.

461
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:19,610
<10-31,Mrs Cooper>他一向自以为聪明
<10-31,Mrs Cooper>He thinks he's such a smarty pants.

462
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:21,010
<10-31,Mrs Cooper>其实跟其他人没什么不同
<10-31,Mrs Cooper>He's no different from any man.

463
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:22,930
<10-31,Mrs Cooper>你让他们别去做什么
<10-31,Mrs Cooper>You tell 'em not to do something,

464
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,350
<10-31,Mrs Cooper>他们就想做什么
<10-31,Mrs Cooper>certainly that's all  they want to do.

465
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:25,850
<10-31,Mrs Cooper>要不是我让我弟弟矮胖墩
<10-31,Mrs Cooper>If I hadn't told my brother Stumpy

466
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,820
<10-31,Mrs Cooper>别用手去清理碎木机
<10-31,Mrs Cooper>not to clear out the wood chipper by hand,

467
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,390
<10-31,Mrs Cooper>他就不会有这外号  还是爱德华了
<10-31,Mrs Cooper>we'd still be calling him Edward.

468
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,160
<10-31,Mrs Cooper>还有  你坐着别动
<10-31,Mrs Cooper>Now, don't you move.

469
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,760
<10-31,Mrs Cooper>我来把菜搬过来
<10-31,Mrs Cooper>I'll bring over all the food.

470
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,860
<10-32,Leonard>不不不  我来就行
<10-32,Leonard>No, no, no, I can do it.

471
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,860
<10-33,Mrs Cooper>真是太给力了
<10-33,Mrs Cooper>Well, isn't that sweet?

472
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,630
<11-1,Sheldon>谢谢你  艾米
<11-1,Sheldon>Thank you, Amy.

473
