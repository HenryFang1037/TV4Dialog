1
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:06,030
<1-1,Raj>《阿凡达》的人物在潘多拉性交时
<1-1,Raj>Okay in Avatar when they have sex in Pandora

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,630
<1-1,Raj>会连接双方的马尾辫  可以推测
<1-1,Raj>they hook up their ponytails, so we know their ponytails

3
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:11,220
<1-1,Raj>马尾辫类似于他们的生殖器
<1-1,Raj>are like their junk.

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,850
<1-2,Howard>那又怎样
<1-2,Howard>Yeah... so?

5
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:15,020
<1-3,Raj>他们骑马或骑鸟的时候
<1-3,Raj>So, when they ride horses and fly on the birds,

6
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:16,390
<1-3,Raj>也会用到马尾辫
<1-3,Raj>they also use their ponytails.

7
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:17,590
<1-4,Howard>你到底想说什么
<1-4,Howard>What's your point?

8
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,480
<1-5,Raj>也就是说  如果我是马或者鸟
<1-5,Raj>My point is, if I were a horse or a bird,

9
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,230
<1-5,Raj>我在詹姆斯·卡梅隆身边会相当紧张
<1-5,Raj>I'd be very nervous around James Cameron.

10
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27,500
<1-6,Sheldon>你对虚构情节如此着迷 实在让我费解
<1-6,Sheldon>It amazes me how you constantly obsess over fictional details

11
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:30,470
<1-6,Sheldon>现实世界中还有很多 重要的事等着你呢
<1-6,Sheldon>when there are more important things in the real world to worry about.

12
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:34,040
<1-6,Sheldon>比如  威廉·夏特纳怎么没出演 新的《星际迷航》电影
<1-6,Sheldon>For example, why wasn't William Shatner in the new Star Trek movie?

13
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:37,410
<1-7,Leonard>谢尔顿 我刚走过行政办公室时
<1-7,Leonard>Hey, Sheldon. I was up in the administration office,

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,110
<1-7,Leonard>无意中听到了 今年大学科学奖
<1-7,Leonard>and I happened to overhear the name of the winner

15
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:42,480
<1-7,Leonard>得奖人的名字
<1-7,Leonard>of this year's Chancellor's Award for Science.

16
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,550
<1-8,Sheldon>你又想趁机打击我
<1-8,Sheldon>And you want to rub my nose in the fact

17
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,420
<1-8,Sheldon>我的成就又被无视了吧
<1-8,Sheldon>that my contributions are being overlooked again?

18
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:49,120
<1-8,Sheldon>我就是理论物理界的威廉·夏特纳
<1-8,Sheldon>I am the William Shatner of theoretical physics.

19
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:51,520
<1-8,Sheldon>好吧  我配合你
<1-8,Sheldon>All right, I'll play.

20
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,690
<1-8,Sheldon>他们今年选了哪个 自以为是 狂妄自大的骗子
<1-8,Sheldon>What self-important, preening fraud are they honoring this year?

21
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:57,260
<1-9,Leonard>我真高兴你这么问  那个人就是你
<1-9,Leonard>Oh, I'm so glad you asked it like that. You.

22
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,300
<1-11,Leonard>-我得奖了  -你得奖了
<1-11,Leonard>- I won?  - You won.

23
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:03,740
<1-10,Sheldon>我得奖啦
<1-10,Sheldon>I won!

24
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:05,540
<1-12,Sheldon>太让我感到意外了
<1-12,Sheldon>This is astonishing.

25
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:08,140
<1-12,Sheldon>不是意外得了奖  没人比我更有资格
<1-12,Sheldon>Not that I won the award-- no one deserves it more.

26
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:11,680
<1-12,Sheldon>其实  我说错了 根本不意外  得奖是意料中的事
<1-12,Sheldon>Actually, I guess I misspoke. It's not astonishing; more like inevitable.

27
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,250
<1-12,Sheldon>我不知道该先做什么 要不先通知我妈
<1-12,Sheldon>I'm not sure what to do first. Maybe I should call my mother.

28
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:19,960
<1-12,Sheldon>我知道啦  做个自访 然后放到网上去
<1-12,Sheldon>Wait! I know-- I'm going to conduct an interview with myself and post it online.

29
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:24,150
<1-13,Raj>真替他高兴
<1-13,Raj>Well, good for him.

30
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:27,060
<1-14,Howard>对  理论物理界的威廉·夏特纳
<1-14,Howard>Yeah, the one thing the William Shatner

31
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:31,160
<1-14,Howard>最需要的就是自我膨胀
<1-14,Howard>of theoretical physics needed was an ego boost.

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,600
<1-14,Howard>生活大爆炸
<1-14,Howard>第三季第十八集

33
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,630
<2-1,Howard>那支长矛逼真得 就像要直接穿过咱的头啊
<2-1,Howard>Didn't it look like that spear was going to go right through your skull?

34
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,100
<2-2,Raj>才怪
<2-2,Raj>No.

35
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,090
<2-3,Leonard>你不买7-11的Slurpee[饮料名] 就没眼镜戴
<2-3,Leonard>Hey, you didn't want a Slurpee at 7-Eleven, you don't get glasses.

36
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,980
<2-4,Sheldon (phone rings)>肯定又是打给我道贺的
<2-4,Sheldon (phone rings)>Oh, that will be another congratulatory call for me.

37
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:31,710
<2-4,Sheldon (phone rings)>请静音
<2-4,Sheldon (phone rings)>Uh, mute, please.

38
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,950
<2-5,Howard>等等  火焰箭呢
<2-5,Howard>Wait, wait. Hang on-- flaming arrow.

39
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,650
<2-6,Sheldon>喂
<2-6,Sheldon>Hello?

40
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:41,490
<2-6,Sheldon>莫顿校长  你好
<2-6,Sheldon>Oh, Chancellor Morton, how are you, sir?

41
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:46,630
<2-6,Sheldon>对  我在等你的电话 三年前就开始了
<2-6,Sheldon>Yes, I was expecting your call. Three years ago.

42
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,160
<2-6,Sheldon>我明白
<2-6,Sheldon>I see.

43
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,170
<2-6,Sheldon>等等  如果我不想做演讲呢
<2-6,Sheldon>Wait. What happens if I choose not to give a speech?

44
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,840
<2-6,Sheldon>嗯
<2-6,Sheldon>Uh-huh.

45
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:56,470
<2-6,Sheldon>如果我不想放弃奖项呢
<2-6,Sheldon>And if I don't want to forfeit the award?

46
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,540
<2-6,Sheldon>好  您现在是箭在弦上  不得不发
<2-6,Sheldon>Well, you've got that tied up in a neat little bow.

47
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,610
<2-6,Sheldon>好吧
<2-6,Sheldon>All right.

48
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:03,210
<2-6,Sheldon>谢谢
<2-6,Sheldon>Thank you.

49
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,080
<2-7,Leonard>有状况
<2-7,Leonard>Problem.

50
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,550
<2-7,Leonard>咋了
<2-7,Leonard>What?

51
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:09,280
<2-8,Sheldon>他们要我在宴会上做演讲
<2-8,Sheldon>They expect me to give a speech at the banquet.

52
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,890
<2-8,Sheldon>我不会做演讲
<2-8,Sheldon>I can't give a speech.

53
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:15,790
<2-9,Howard>不  你弄错了 你一直都滔滔不绝
<2-9,Howard>Well, no, you're mistaken. You give speeches all the time.

54
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:20,960
<2-9,Howard>你是不会闭嘴
<2-9,Howard>What you can't do is shut up.

55
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,030
<2-10,Raj>看电影前
<2-10,Raj>Yeah, before the movie,

56
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,460
<2-10,Raj>你说了20分钟为啥鳄梨酱变棕色了
<2-10,Raj>you did 20 minutes on why guacamole turns brown.

57
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:28,470
<2-10,Raj>你说话的时候  它就变棕色了
<2-10,Raj>It turned brown while you were talking.

58
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:32,470
<2-11,Sheldon>我在小群体面前能自如讲话
<2-11,Sheldon>I am perfectly comfortable speaking to small groups.

59
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:34,640
<2-11,Sheldon>但没法在大群体面前演讲
<2-11,Sheldon>I cannot speak to large crowds.

60
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,150
<2-12,Leonard>你的大群体怎么定义
<2-12,Leonard>What, to you, is a large crowd?

61
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,650
<2-13,Sheldon>大到能把我踩死的那种
<2-13,Sheldon>Any group big enough to trample me to death.

62
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:44,050
<2-13,Sheldon>按经验估计是36个成人或70个儿童
<2-13,Sheldon>General rule of thumb is 36 adults or 70 children.

63
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:47,090
<2-14,Penny>谢尔顿  恭喜恭喜
<2-14,Penny>Sheldon, congratulations.

64
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,760
<2-14,Penny>从店里给你带了芝士蛋糕
<2-14,Penny>Brought you a cheesecake from work.

65
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,260
<2-14,Penny>这是给你庆祝得奖的
<2-14,Penny>You know, 'cause of your award,

66
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:52,090
<2-14,Penny>不是因为小工对着它打了喷嚏
<2-14,Penny>not because a busboy sneezed on it.

67
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,930
<2-15,Sheldon>-我不接受奖项了  -为什么
<2-15,Sheldon>- I'm not accepting the award.  - Why not?

68
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:01,470
<2-17,Howard>因为伟大的谢尔顿居然会怯场
<2-17,Howard>Turns out the great Sheldon Cooper has stage fright.

69
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,640
<2-18,Penny>那也没有理由退出啊
<2-18,Penny>That's no reason to back out.

70
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:05,640
<2-18,Penny>我以前在高中时 得了个很大的奖
<2-18,Penny>You know, I once got a pretty big honor in high school,

71
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,080
<2-18,Penny>而我很怕面对一大群人
<2-18,Penny>and I was terrified about appearing in front of a big crowd,

72
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:10,280
<2-18,Penny>但我挺过来了  知道吗
<2-18,Penny>but I went through with it, and you know what?

73
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,180
<2-18,Penny>作为玉米皇后团的成员之一
<2-18,Penny>The world looked pretty darn good

74
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,880
<2-18,Penny>坐在福特F150后面放的干草堆上
<2-18,Penny>sitting on a haystack in the back of a Ford F-150

75
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,950
<2-18,Penny>那是相当的风光啊
<2-18,Penny>as a member of the Corn Queen's court.

76
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:20,990
<2-19,Sheldon>谢谢
<2-19,Sheldon>Thank you.

77
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,320
<2-19,Sheldon>我会牢记在心的
<2-19,Sheldon>Yeah, I'll bear that in mind

78
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,990
<2-19,Sheldon>如果我被提名乡巴佬和平奖的话
<2-19,Sheldon>if I'm ever nominated for the Hillbilly Peace Prize.

79
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,600
<2-20,Leonard>谢尔顿  你小题大做了
<2-20,Leonard>Sheldon, you're being ridiculous.

80
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:30,630
<2-21,Sheldon>是吗
<2-21,Sheldon>Am I?

81
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:31,970
<2-21,Sheldon>我给你们讲个故事
<2-21,Sheldon>Let me tell you a story.

82
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,670
<2-22,Howard>咱现在就需要70个儿童
<2-22,Howard>Where's 70 children when you need them?

83
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:40,510
<2-23,Sheldon>我14岁时以Summa cum laude的成绩从大学毕业
<2-23,Sheldon>I was 14 and graduating summa cum laude from college.

84
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:43,850
<2-23,Sheldon>Summa cum laude在拉丁语里是指最高荣誉
<2-23,Sheldon>"Summa cum laude" is Latin for "with highest honors."

85
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,520
<2-24,Penny>你要是能跳过 没人问的东西就好了
<2-24,Penny>I just love how you always skip over the part where no one asks.

86
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:51,020
<2-25,Sheldon>我要在毕业典礼上做致词
<2-25,Sheldon>I was valedictorian and expected to give an address.

87
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,290
<2-25,Sheldon>我到现在还记得当时
<2-25,Sheldon>Even now, I can remember that moment

88
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,490
<2-25,Sheldon>我走上讲台  看着人群
<2-25,Sheldon>when I walked up to the podium and looked out at the crowd.

89
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,490
<2-25,Sheldon>台下数以千计的人
<2-25,Sheldon>There must have been thousands of people.

90
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:00,730
<2-25,Sheldon>我的心开始剧烈跳动
<2-25,Sheldon>My heart started pounding in my chest.

91
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,300
<2-25,Sheldon>然后开始大口呼气
<2-25,Sheldon>I began to hyperventilate.

92
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:05,970
<2-25,Sheldon>视力渐渐模糊  还没来得及...
<2-25,Sheldon>My vision became blurry, and before I knew it...

93
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,940
<2-25,Sheldon>晕啊
<2-25,Sheldon>Oh, dear.

94
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:09,540
<2-26,Penny>老天
<2-26,Penny>Oh, my God.

95
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:10,610
<2-27,Leonard>谢尔顿
<2-27,Leonard>Sheldon?

96
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,170
<2-27,Leonard>谢尔顿  你没事吧
<2-27,Leonard>Sheldon, are you okay?

97
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:14,210
<2-28,Sheldon>表踩我啊
<2-28,Sheldon>Don't trample me.

98
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,610
<3-1,Sheldon>拜托  妈妈
<3-1,Sheldon>Come on, Mother.

99
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,650
<3-1,Sheldon>你知道我为啥不接受奖项
<3-1,Sheldon>You know why I can't accept the award.

100
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:24,850
<3-1,Sheldon>恕我直言  我不觉得祈祷会有用
<3-1,Sheldon>With all due respect, I don't think praying will help.

101
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:28,960
<3-1,Sheldon>没  我没听过那首 "主啊  请掌控这命运之轮"
<3-1,Sheldon>No, I have not heard the song, "Jesus, Take the Wheel."

102
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:32,960
<3-1,Sheldon>不用不用 你不需要唱给我听
<3-1,Sheldon>No, no... You don't need to start singing it.

103
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,160
<3-1,Sheldon>好  我会在iTunes上下载的  妈妈
<3-1,Sheldon>Yes, I'll buy it on the iTunes, Mother.

<3-1,Sheldon>再见  妈妈
<3-1,Sheldon>Good-bye, Mother.

<3-6,Sheldon>我深表怀疑
<3-6,Sheldon>Oh, I doubt that.

112
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,090
<3-6,Sheldon>我比你们智商都高 我都没想出办法呢
<3-6,Sheldon>I haven't figured out a way, and I'm much smarter than all of you.

113
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:06,400
<3-7,Penny>是的  可我们几个的智商加起来肯定比你高
<3-7,Penny>Yes, but you're not smarter than all of us put together.

114
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:09,500
<3-8,Sheldon>不好意思 还是我高
<3-8,Sheldon>Oh, I'm sorry. That is what I meant.

<3-10,Leonard>We can help you. We can be your team.

117
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:18,740
<3-10,Leonard>就像  X教授和X战警
<3-10,Leonard>Like, uh, Professor Xavier and his X-Men.

118
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:25,110
<3-11,Sheldon>我确实挺喜欢《X战警》
<3-11,Sheldon>I do like the X-Men.

119
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:27,350
<3-12,Penny>我看过《X战警》吗
<3-12,Penny>Did I see X-Men?

120
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,990
<3-13,Leonard>看过啊  我们上周才看的 你还说你喜欢呢
<3-13,Leonard>Yeah, we watched it last week. You said you liked it.

121
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,720
<3-14,Penny>亲爱的  说话又不用付钱
<3-14,Penny>Oh. I say a lot of things, sweetie.

122
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:35,590
<3-14,Penny>怎么样啊  谢尔顿
<3-14,Penny>So, how about it, Sheldon?

123
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:37,060
<3-14,Penny>不好说
<3-14,Penny>I don't know.

124
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:40,560
<3-15,Sheldon>如果你们是X战警  那你们的超能力是什么
<3-15,Sheldon>If you're my X-Men, what are your powers?

125
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,400
<3-16,Penny>这个  我会带你去购物 帮你选一套超赞的西装
<3-16,Penny>Okay. Well, I am going to take you shopping, get you a nice suit.

126
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,800
<3-16,Penny>能让你更自信
<3-16,Penny>Might give you more confidence.

127
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,000
<3-17,Sheldon>确切来说这不叫变异  光凭这点你不可能
<3-17,Sheldon>That's not exactly a mutation that would get you

128
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,380
<3-17,Sheldon>进到X教授专为天赋异禀的年轻人开设的学校
<3-17,Sheldon>into Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters,

129
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:50,940
<3-17,Sheldon>不过继续
<3-17,Sheldon>but go on.

130
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,240
<3-17,Sheldon>莱纳德
<3-17,Sheldon>Leonard?

131
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,310
<3-18,Leonard>我可以对你进行心理分析
<3-18,Leonard>I thought I could try to analyze you

132
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:56,350
<3-18,Leonard>然后找出让你如此焦虑的根源
<3-18,Leonard>and get to the root of your anxiety.

133
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:59,720
<3-19,Sheldon>你凭什么觉得你能读懂我的内心呢
<3-19,Sheldon>What qualifies you to attempt to understand my mind?

134
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,280
<3-20,Leonard>我妈是一位杰出的精神病专家
<3-20,Leonard>My mother is a highly regarded psychiatrist,

135
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,550
<3-20,Leonard>而且自从她指责我过于依赖母乳开始
<3-20,Leonard>and I've been in therapy ever since she accused me

136
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:08,090
<3-20,Leonard>我就一直在接受治疗
<3-20,Leonard>of breast-feeding codependently.

137
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,430
<3-21,Howard>拉杰说他可以教你
<3-21,Howard>Raj says he can teach you...

138
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,430
<3-21,Howard>什么名字来着
<3-21,Howard>What did you call it?

139
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:17,730
<3-21,Howard>我记不住  一些扯淡的印度冥想
<3-21,Howard>I don't know-- some Indian meditation crap.

140
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:24,050
<3-22,Sheldon>明白了 由于前三位的水准 都严重不靠谱
<3-22,Sheldon>I see. Well, I assume, since the rest of you have set the bar so low,

141
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:26,440
<3-22,Sheldon>我想你们是把最睿智的办法放到了最后
<3-22,Sheldon>you're saving the most impressive contribution for last.

142
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,880
<3-22,Sheldon>说吧  霍华德 惊我一下
<3-22,Sheldon>Go ahead, Howard. Dazzle me.

143
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:34,620
<3-23,Howard>我的超能力就是我可以
<3-23,Howard>My power is the ability to pretend

144
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:38,550
<3-23,Howard>假装我很在意你这尿频尿急类的鬼问题
<3-23,Howard>like I give a damn about your piddily-ass problems.

145
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:46,030
<3-23,Howard>而且我能一直装下去  伙计
<3-23,Howard>And that's 24-seven, buddy.

146
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:50,170
<3-24,Sheldon>我很感激你如此做作
<3-24,Sheldon>And I appreciate the pretense.

147
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,570
<3-25,Penny>怎么样啊  谢尔顿
<3-25,Penny>So, what do you say, Sheldon?

148
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,270
<3-25,Penny>我们是你的X战警吗
<3-25,Penny>Are we your X-Men?

149
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,470
<3-25,Penny>不是
<3-25,Penny>No.

150
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:58,870
<3-26,Sheldon>X战警这名字来源于X教授的姓氏
<3-26,Sheldon>The X-Men were named for the "X" in Charles Xavier.

151
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:03,250
<3-26,Sheldon>既然我叫谢尔顿·库珀  那你们就是C战警(与精液谐音)
<3-26,Sheldon>Since I am Sheldon Cooper, you will be my C-Men.

152
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,420
<3-27,Howard>这名字可不怎么好听
<3-27,Howard>Oh, that's not a good name.

153
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,770
<4-1,Raj>好了  谢尔顿 我将引导你进行
<4-1,Raj>Okay, Sheldon. I'm going to be leading you

154
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:20,980
<4-1,Raj>一系列的冥想练习
<4-1,Raj>through a series of meditation exercises.

155
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:24,280
<4-1,Raj>这些方法是从古代印度大师那里
<4-1,Raj>These methods come from the ancient gurus of India

156
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:27,480
<4-1,Raj>传承下来的  也帮我克服了自己的恐惧
<4-1,Raj>and have helped me overcome my own fears.

157
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:31,320
<4-2,Sheldon>可你还是不敢和女人说话
<4-2,Sheldon>And yet, you can't speak to women.

158
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,790
<4-3,Raj>确实  不过托冥想的福  我可以和女人
<4-3,Raj>True, but thanks to meditation, I am able to stay

159
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,280
<4-3,Raj>呆在同一房间  而且不会被吓到尿裤子
<4-3,Raj>in the same room with them without urinating.

160
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:42,960
<4-3,Raj>现在  闭上双眼
<4-3,Raj>Now... close your eyes.

161
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,900
<4-4,Sheldon>好的  不过不许打我
<4-4,Sheldon>Okay, but don't punch me.

162
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,270
<4-5,Raj>什么
<4-5,Raj>What?

163
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,540
<4-6,Sheldon>小时候  我姐姐会对我说
<4-6,Sheldon>When I was little, my sister would say to me,

164
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,440
<4-6,Sheldon>"闭上双眼  惊喜出现"
<4-6,Sheldon>"Close your eyes, you'll get a surprise,"

165
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:53,240
<4-6,Sheldon>然后她就会给我一拳
<4-6,Sheldon>and then she'd punch me.

166
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,080
<4-7,Raj>我不会打你的
<4-7,Raj>I'm not going to punch you.

167
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:57,050
<4-8,Sheldon>我姐姐以前也这么说的
<4-8,Sheldon>That's what my sister used to say.

168
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,550
<4-9,Raj>你到底还练不练了
<4-9,Raj>Do you want to do this or not?

169
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,350
<4-10,Sheldon>抱歉  请继续
<4-10,Sheldon>I'm sorry. Proceed.

170
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,050
<4-10,Sheldon>好的
<4-10,Sheldon>All right.

171
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:06,890
<4-11,Raj>想象你正身处一个 最有家的感觉的地方
<4-11,Raj>Imagine yourself in the one place you feel most at home.

172
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,260
<4-11,Raj>是哪里呢
<4-11,Raj>Where is that?

173
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:11,230
<4-12,Sheldon>模拟城市[一款游戏]
<4-12,Sheldon>Sim City.

174
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:15,930
<4-12,Sheldon>更确切地说  是我设计的模拟城市
<4-12,Sheldon>More specifically, the Sim City I designed--

175
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:18,000
<4-13,Raj>谢尔顿奥波利斯
<4-13,Raj>Sheldonopolis.

176
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:20,470
<4-13,Raj>好的  你身处谢尔顿奥波利斯
<4-13,Raj>Okay, you're in Sheldonopolis.

177
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,200
<4-14,Sheldon>确切的地点是哪
<4-14,Sheldon>Where exactly?

178
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,340
<4-14,Sheldon>谢尔顿广场  谢尔顿之塔
<4-14,Sheldon>Sheldon Square? Sheldon Towers?

179
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:28,010
<4-14,Sheldon>还是人称谢尔顿勇士之家的谢尔顿运动场
<4-14,Sheldon>Sheldon Stadium, home of the Fighting Sheldons?

180
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,510
<4-15,Raj>随你喜欢
<4-15,Raj>Whatever you like.

181
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:32,280
<4-16,Sheldon>不是说你引导我冥想吗
<4-16,Sheldon>I thought this was supposed to be a guided meditation.

182
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:35,120
<4-17,Raj>好吧  你在谢尔顿广场
<4-17,Raj>Fine. You're in Sheldon Square.

183
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,320
<4-18,Sheldon>是吗  这个季节吗
<4-18,Sheldon>Really? This time of year?

184
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:37,720
<4-18,Sheldon>那可有点冷
<4-18,Sheldon>It's a bit nippy.

185
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,790
<4-19,Raj>那就穿件毛衣
<4-19,Raj>Then, put on a sweater.

186
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,720
<4-20,Sheldon>那我可以去市中心的
<4-20,Sheldon>Suppose I could run downtown

187
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,030
<4-20,Sheldon>谢尔玛买一件
<4-20,Sheldon>and pick up something at Shel-Mart.

188
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,000
<4-21,Raj>随便啊  去买件毛衣就是了
<4-21,Raj>Yeah, whatever. Just go buy a sweater.

189
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:49,330
<4-22,Sheldon>好处就是谢尔玛是我开的
<4-22,Sheldon>You know, the nice thing about Shel-Mart is I own it,

190
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:51,770
<4-22,Sheldon>所以我买东西85折
<4-22,Sheldon>so I get a 15% discount.

191
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,440
<4-23,Raj>还不都你说了算 痛快拿件毛衣就行了
<4-23,Raj>You own the damn thing. Just take a freaking sweater!

192
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,640
<4-24,Sheldon>上一季度我根本没有盈利
<4-24,Sheldon>Look, I didn't turn a profit last quarter

193
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:00,640
<4-24,Sheldon>就是因为我肆无忌惮地拿东西不给钱
<4-24,Sheldon>by taking product off the shelves willy-nilly.

194
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,410
<4-25,Raj>好吧
<4-25,Raj>All right.

195
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:07,450
<4-25,Raj>你买了件毛衣  现在你在谢尔顿广场
<4-25,Raj>You've paid for a sweater, and you're in Sheldon Square.

196
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,850
<4-25,Raj>等等
<4-25,Raj>Hang on.

197
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,760
<4-26,Sheldon>是开衫的  我得扣上扣子
<4-26,Sheldon>It's a cardigan. I have to button it.

198
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,030
<4-26,Sheldon>不会吧
<4-26,Sheldon>Oh, no.

199
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,190
<4-27,Raj>又怎么了
<4-27,Raj>What now?

200
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:22,230
<4-28,Sheldon>一个类似哥斯拉的怪物正在接近城市
<4-28,Sheldon>A Godzilla-like monster is approaching the city.

201
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,570
<4-28,Sheldon>我得把我的市民转移到安全区
<4-28,Sheldon>I have to get my people to safety.

202
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,770
<4-28,Sheldon>谢尔顿奥波利斯的市民们  我是你们的市长
<4-28,Sheldon>People of Sheldonopolis, this is your mayor.

203
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,040
<4-28,Sheldon>跟着我
<4-28,Sheldon>Follow me.

204
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:32,670
<4-28,Sheldon>小孩子要是跑不了  就别管他们了
<4-28,Sheldon>If the children can't run, leave them behind.

205
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:37,550
<4-28,Sheldon>哎哟妈呀  模拟恐怖效果贼棒
<4-28,Sheldon>Oh, the simulated horror!

206
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,590
<4-28,Sheldon>拉杰
<4-28,Sheldon>Raj?

207
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,960
<4-28,Sheldon>我就知道
<4-28,Sheldon>Just as I suspected.

208
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:54,600
<4-28,Sheldon>什么冥想不过是噱头
<4-28,Sheldon>Meditation is nothing but hokum.

209
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:02,710
<5-1,Sheldon>我相当质疑你的说法
<5-1,Sheldon>I question your premise.

210
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,950
<5-1,Sheldon>要防止我在满屋子人面前晕倒
<5-1,Sheldon>How is a new suit going to prevent me

211
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,250
<5-1,Sheldon>买套新西装有个毛用了
<5-1,Sheldon>from passing out in front of a ballroom full of people?

212
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,250
<5-1,Sheldon>那会让你充满自信
<5-1,Sheldon>It'll give you confidence.

213
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:10,950
<5-2,Penny>只要我倍感压力时
<5-2,Penny>You know, sometimes when I'm feeling all stressed out

214
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:13,250
<5-2,Penny>我就会去买件可爱上衣
<5-2,Penny>about something, I go out and buy a cute top

215
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:16,390
<5-2,Penny>或漂漂裙裙  如此一来就会容光焕发
<5-2,Penny>or a fun skirt and I have a whole new outlook on life.

216
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:20,230
<5-3,Sheldon>你傻的啊  难道你没意识到 你只是换了皮囊  内压犹在啊
<5-3,Sheldon>Don't you eventually realize you're just the same stressed out person

217
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,330
<5-3,Sheldon>穿可爱上装和漂漂裙裙有啥用
<5-3,Sheldon>in a cute top or a fun skirt?

218
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,030
<5-4,Penny>是的  所以还要买鞋子
<5-4,Penny>Yeah, that's when I buy shoes.

219
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,700
<5-4,Penny>我们来选选
<5-4,Penny>Now, let's see what we've got.

220
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,270
<5-4,Penny>这件帅气
<5-4,Penny>This is nice.

221
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:34,180
<5-5,Sheldon>这件就一个颜色
<5-5,Sheldon>It's only one color.

222
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:35,540
<5-6,Penny>是啊  咋了
<5-6,Penny>Yeah, so?

223
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:38,750
<5-7,Sheldon>就一个颜色还这么贵  岂不是亏了
<5-7,Sheldon>That's a lot of money for only one color.

224
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:39,780
<5-7,Sheldon>好吧
<5-7,Sheldon>Fine.

225
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,620
<5-8,Penny>你自己选自己喜欢的
<5-8,Penny>Why don't you pick out what you like.

226
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:47,190
<5-8,Penny>这件很犀利
<5-8,Penny>This is pretty sharp.

227
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:55,560
<6-1,Penny>不 没门儿
<6-1,Penny>No. You're wrong.

228
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:58,670
<5-4,Penny>这件够劲
<5-4,Penny>This is great.

229
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:02,000
<5-4,Penny>我六岁时也有件差不多样式的
<5-4,Penny>I had a suit like this when I was six.

230
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,980
<5-4,Penny>好吧  这件绝对无可挑剔
<5-4,Penny>Okay, I think we have a winner.

231
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,550
<7-1,Penny>靠  你哪儿弄来的这件
<7-1,Penny>Where the hell'd you find that?

232
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,920
<7-2,Sheldon>舞会礼服柜台
<7-2,Sheldon>In the prom department.

233
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:16,320
<7-3,Penny>这也太可笑了
<7-3,Penny>It's ridiculous.

234
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:20,260
<7-4,Sheldon>玉米皇后团前团员没资格说这话吧
<7-4,Sheldon>Says the former member of the Corn Queen's Court.

235
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:23,760
<7-5,Penny>去试试这件再说
<7-5,Penny>Please just try this one on.

236
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:28,660
<7-6,Sheldon>好吧 现在不管我穿啥 和之前的相比都只能相形见拙了
<7-6,Sheldon>Okay. But anything I put on now is only going to suffer in comparison.

237
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:38,010
<7-6,Sheldon>这太荒唐了 简直像个小丑
<7-6,Sheldon>This is absurd. I look like a clown.

238
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:44,610
<8-1,Leonard>谢尔顿
<8-1,Leonard>So, Sheldon...

239
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,350
<8-1,Leonard>你最近如何
<8-1,Leonard>...how you doing?

240
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:51,990
<8-2,Sheldon>你就这样开始心理治疗吗
<8-2,Sheldon>That's how you start a psychotherapy session?

241
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,320
<8-2,Sheldon>居然问这种蠢问题
<8-2,Sheldon>"How am I doing?"

242
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,820
<8-2,Sheldon>我本来满心期待进行一场
<8-2,Sheldon>I was promised a riverboat journey

243
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:58,090
<8-2,Sheldon>对自我潜意识的探寻之旅
<8-2,Sheldon>into the jungles of my subconscious.

244
00:12:58,130 --> 00:12:59,990
<8-2,Sheldon>结果呢  我都听到什么鬼问题啊
<8-2,Sheldon>Instead, I get the same question I hear

245
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:03,160
<8-2,Sheldon>拉尔夫餐厅切香肠的女招待都问得出来
<8-2,Sheldon>from the lady who slices my bologna at Ralph's.

246
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,230
<8-3,Leonard>抱歉  我重来
<8-3,Leonard>I'm sorry, I'll start again.

247
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:10,370
<8-4,Sheldon>我还是说说我的梦境吧 对你有帮助吗
<8-4,Sheldon>Would it be helpful to you if I told you about my dreams?

248
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:12,370
<8-5,Leonard>我也不知道  也许吧
<8-5,Leonard>Um, I don't know, maybe.

249
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:17,180
<8-6,Sheldon>我最近做了个梦 梦到我变成了巨人
<8-6,Sheldon>I recently had a dream that I was a giant.

250
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:19,750
<8-6,Sheldon>但周围的东西还是原来的比例
<8-6,Sheldon>But everything around me was to scale,

251
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,880
<8-6,Sheldon>所以相比之下没什么差别
<8-6,Sheldon>so it all looked normal.

252
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:29,190
<8-7,Leonard>既然周围东西都没什么变化 你怎么知道自己变成了巨人
<8-7,Leonard>How did you know you were a giant if everything was to scale?

253
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:32,760
<8-8,Sheldon>我穿着条型号为一百万的裤子
<8-8,Sheldon>I was wearing size a million pants.

254
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,900
<8-9,Leonard>我们还是来自由谈话吧
<8-9,Leonard>Why don't we just talk?

255
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:41,540
<8-10,Sheldon>自由谈话疗法 经典精神分析疗法  不错
<8-10,Sheldon>The talking cure. Classical Freudian. Good choice.

256
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,540
<8-10,Sheldon>我补充一点可能会有所帮助
<8-10,Sheldon>If it will help speed things along,

257
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:47,080
<8-10,Sheldon>我做标准罗夏墨迹测验的结果是
<8-10,Sheldon>uh, my answers to the standard Rorschach ink blot test are:

259
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:52,080
<8-10,Sheldon>图A  蝙蝠  图B  蝙蝠 图C  蝙蝠
<8-10,Sheldon>A) a bat, B) a bat, c) a bat,

260
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:57,520
<8-10,Sheldon>图D  我爸想用皮下注射器杀死我妈
<8-10,Sheldon>and D) my father killing my mother with a hypodermic needle.

261
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,720
<8-11,Leonard>还是我来说吧
<8-11,Leonard>Why don't I just start?

262
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:05,460
<8-11,Leonard>这种事时有发生 人们难以接受一项荣誉
<8-11,Leonard>Sometimes people have trouble accepting accolades

263
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:09,330
<8-11,Leonard>那是因为在潜意识中 他们自觉不配拥有
<8-11,Leonard>if, on a subconscious level, they don't feel they deserve them.

264
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:11,530
<8-11,Leonard>会不会你的原因也是如此呢
<8-11,Leonard>Do you think maybe that's what's happening here?

265
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:14,100
<8-12,Sheldon>真的假的  莱纳德
<8-12,Sheldon>Really, Leonard?

266
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:18,040
<8-12,Sheldon>你是想把阿德勒学说中的
<8-12,Sheldon>You're just going to try to recycle Adler's doctrine

267
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:19,470
<8-12,Sheldon>自卑情结套用在我身上吗
<8-12,Sheldon>of the inferiority complex?

268
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:22,510
<8-12,Sheldon>这连拉尔夫餐厅的女招待都知道
<8-12,Sheldon>I could probably get that from the woman at Ralph's.

269
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:25,950
<8-12,Sheldon>说不定她还会白送我芝士呢
<8-12,Sheldon>And she'd let me taste some pieces of cheese for free.

270
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,880
<8-13,Leonard>但这可能是问题所在
<8-13,Leonard>But it could be part of your problem.

271
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,280
<8-13,Leonard>我举个例子吧
<8-13,Leonard>Let me give you an example.

272
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,890
<8-13,Leonard>我8岁时
<8-13,Leonard>When I was eight,

273
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,090
<8-13,Leonard>我的一个项目  "古典音乐有助青豆生长"
<8-13,Leonard>I won a ribbon at the science fair

274
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,760
<8-13,Leonard>在科技展上得了奖  授予了我一条勋带
<8-13,Leonard>for my project, "Do Lima Beans Grow Better to Classical Music."

275
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:39,030
<8-13,Leonard>但我妈妈却说
<8-13,Leonard>But my mother pointed out

276
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,960
<8-13,Leonard>这和我哥哥以前的研究  "摇滚乐有害于青豆生长"
<8-13,Leonard>that it was just a rehash of my brother's earlier

277
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,930
<8-13,Leonard>根本没差  只不过换汤不换药
<8-13,Leonard>"Do Lima Beans Grow Worse to Rock 'n' Roll."

278
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:50,170
<8-13,Leonard>我倍受打击  于是把勋带退了回去
<8-13,Leonard>I felt so guilty, I gave the ribbon back.

279
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:52,740
<8-14,Sheldon>你感觉如何
<8-14,Sheldon>And how did that make you feel?

280
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,710
<8-15,Leonard>糟透了
<8-15,Leonard>Terrible.

281
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,650
<8-15,Leonard>对那个研究我付出了很多心血
<8-15,Leonard>I worked really hard on that project.

282
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,080
<8-15,Leonard>我整晚都不睡  就对着青豆芽
<8-15,Leonard>I stayed up all night singing the clown's aria from Pagliacci

283
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,920
<8-15,Leonard>唱《丑角》里的咏叹调[莱昂卡瓦洛作曲]
<8-15,Leonard>to a lima bean sprout.

284
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:07,390
<8-16,Sheldon>继续说
<8-16,Sheldon>Go on.

285
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,390
<8-17,Leonard>这又不是我的错
<8-17,Leonard>It wasn't my fault.

286
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:11,990
<8-17,Leonard>我不知道我哥的研究
<8-17,Leonard>I had never seen my brother's project.

287
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:14,200
<8-17,Leonard>我妈之前本可以告诉我
<8-17,Leonard>And my mother could've told me before

288
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:17,430
<8-17,Leonard>她却在颁奖典礼上当着众人面说出来
<8-17,Leonard>instead of at the ceremony in front of everyone.

289
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:22,840
<8-18,Sheldon>这么说 你很生你母亲的气咯
<8-18,Sheldon>So, I hear you saying you're angry with your mother.

290
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:25,940
<8-19,Leonard>当然气  我恨死她了
<8-19,Leonard>Damn right, I'm angry with my mother.

291
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:34,120
<8-19,Leonard>行行好嘛  我那会儿才8岁
<8-19,Leonard>For God's sake, I was eight years old.

292
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:36,020
<8-19,Leonard>她却这么当众羞辱我
<8-19,Leonard>She humiliated me.

293
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:38,920
<8-19,Leonard>就是在那之后  我又开始尿床
<8-19,Leonard>That's when the bed-wetting started again.

294
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,590
<8-20,Sheldon>多谢了  莱纳德
<8-20,Sheldon>Thank you, Leonard.

295
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,160
<8-21,Leonard>谢什么啊
<8-21,Leonard>For what?

296
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:45,960
<8-22,Sheldon>像你这样受了如此打击
<8-22,Sheldon>If someone as damaged as you

297
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:48,360
<8-22,Sheldon>还能每天早上从床上爬起来
<8-22,Sheldon>can find his way to crawl out of bed each morning,

298
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,870
<8-22,Sheldon>我想小小一个颁奖典礼  应该不成问题
<8-22,Sheldon>I think I can face a simple award ceremony.

299
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:56,370
<8-23,Leonard>等等  就这样吗 不是该有一整个小时的吗
<8-23,Leonard>Wait, that's it? I thought we had a whole hour!

300
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:01,840
<9-1,Leonard>女士们先生们  晚上好 我是莱纳德·霍夫斯塔德博士
<9-1,Leonard>Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Dr. Leonard Hofstadter,

301
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,850
<9-1,Leonard>很荣幸向各位隆重介绍
<9-1,Leonard>and it is my very great honor to introduce

302
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:06,750
<9-1,Leonard>本年度大学科学奖得主
<9-1,Leonard>the winner of this year's Chancellor's award for Science

303
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:09,580
<9-1,Leonard>我的好友谢尔顿·库珀博士
<9-1,Leonard>and my good friend, Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

304
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:12,890
<9-1,Leonard>但在此之前
<9-1,Leonard>But before I do,

305
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,320
<9-1,Leonard>请允许我先宣读下谢尔顿母亲的来信
<9-1,Leonard>I'd like to share with you a letter from Sheldon's mother,

306
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,990
<9-1,Leonard>很遗憾她今晚未能亲临
<9-1,Leonard>who couldn't be here tonight.

307
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:21,660
<9-1,Leonard>很温馨了  是吧  他妈妈给他写了封信
<9-1,Leonard>Isn't that nice? His mother sent him a letter.

308
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:26,570
<9-1,Leonard>他为自己儿子感到自豪  真想知道那会是什么感觉...
<9-1,Leonard>She's proud of him. I wonder what that feels like...

309
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:34,070
<9-1,Leonard>亲爱的谢利  她都是这么叫他的  谢利  这是个昵称
<9-1,Leonard>"Dear Shelly." that's what she calls him. Shelly-- it's a pet name.

310
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:37,610
<9-1,Leonard>知道我妈给我取的什么昵称吗  莱纳德
<9-1,Leonard>You know what my mother's pet name for me is? Leonard.

311
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:43,080
<9-1,Leonard>我又离题了
<9-1,Leonard>But I digress.

312
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,150
<9-1,Leonard>亲爱的谢利...
<9-1,Leonard>"Dear Shelly..."

313
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:46,090
<9-2,Sheldon>天哪
<9-2,Sheldon>Oh, dear.

314
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,090
<9-3,Penny>你怎么了
<9-3,Penny>What's the matter?

315
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,290
<9-4,Sheldon>我有点晕
<9-4,Sheldon>I'm getting dizzy.

316
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,620
<9-5,Raj>别担心
<9-5,Raj>Don't worry.

317
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:52,430
<9-5,Raj>你的C战警们(精液 semen)都守护着你
<9-5,Raj>You're surrounded by your C-Men.

318
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,960
<9-6,Sheldon>我做不到
<9-6,Sheldon>I can't do this.

319
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,360
<9-6,Sheldon>我要晕倒了
<9-6,Sheldon>I'm going to faint.

320
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,430
<9-7,Penny>给  喝点这个  能让你放松
<9-7,Penny>Here, drink this.It'll relax you.

321
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,460
<9-8,Sheldon>酒吗
<9-8,Sheldon>Alcohol?

322
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,270
<9-8,Sheldon>-我不喝酒的  -好吧  那你晕吧
<9-8,Sheldon>- I don't drink alcohol. - Fine, faint.

323
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:09,510
<9-10,Sheldon>没觉得有何不同  这酒根本没用
<9-10,Sheldon>I don't feel different.This alcohol is defective.

324
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:12,780
<9-11,Penny>给  看这个有没有用
<9-11,Penny>Here, see if this one works.

325
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:19,920
<9-12,Leonard (still talking)>首先 那是完全不同的实验主题
<9-12,Leonard (still talking)>First of all, the projects were totally different.

326
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:23,090
<9-12,Leonard (still talking)>我的实验证明  培植青豆时  给它们放古典乐
<9-12,Leonard (still talking)>I was showing that classical music nurtures lima beans

327
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,460
<9-12,Leonard (still talking)>能促进它们生长  但我妈根本不听我的
<9-12,Leonard (still talking)>and makes them grow, but my mother didn't hear me.

328
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:29,300
<9-12,Leonard (still talking)>想知道精心培育能不能促进成长吗
<9-12,Leonard (still talking)>If you'd like to look at the relationship between nurturing and growth,

329
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:33,660
<9-12,Leonard (still talking)>我想郑重指出  我哥哥比我高了整整八英寸[20cm]
<9-12,Leonard (still talking)>I'd like to point out that my brother is eight inches taller than me.

330
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,700
<9-13,Sheldon>我准备好了
<9-13,Sheldon>I'm ready.

331
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,440
<9-13,Sheldon>对了
<9-13,Sheldon>right.

332
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:43,210
<9-14,Leonard>女士们先生们  欢迎我们的贵宾  谢尔顿·库珀博士
<9-14,Leonard>Ladies and gentlemen, our guest of honor Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

333
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:49,510
<9-15,Sheldon>谢了小矮人  下面我接手就行了
<9-15,Sheldon>Thanks, shorty, I'll take it from here.

334
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:52,250
<9-15,Sheldon>好了  大家准备好来点乐子了吗
<9-15,Sheldon>All right, you people ready to have some fun?

335
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,850
<9-15,Sheldon>你们都对微积分有基本认识
<9-15,Sheldon>You have a basic understanding of differential calculus

336
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:57,050
<9-15,Sheldon>并至少学过一年代数拓扑吧
<9-15,Sheldon>and at least one year of algebraic topology?

337
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:58,990
<9-15,Sheldon>好吧  下面是笑话时间
<9-15,Sheldon>Well, then here come the jokes.

339
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,260
<9-15,Sheldon>鸡为什么要穿过默比乌斯带
<9-15,Sheldon>Why did the chicken cross the Mobius strip?

340
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,200
<9-15,Sheldon>为了回到同一侧  逗你玩呢
<9-15,Sheldon>To get to the same side-- bazinga!

341
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:11,600
<9-15,Sheldon>还有  一个中子走进家酒吧问道 酒多少钱一杯
<9-15,Sheldon>All right, a neutron walks into a bar and asks, "How much for a drink?"

342
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,740
<9-15,Sheldon>酒保回答  你买吗  免费(无电荷)
<9-15,Sheldon>The bartender says, "For you, no charge."

343
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,710
<9-15,Sheldon>有人在吗
<9-15,Sheldon>Hello?

344
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:22,710
<9-15,Sheldon>我知道你们在的
<9-15,Sheldon>I know you're out there.

345
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:27,050
<9-15,Sheldon>能听到你们代谢氧气  排出二氧化碳的声音
<9-15,Sheldon>I can hear you metabolizing oxygen and expelling carbon dioxide.

346

<9-15,Sheldon>I kid the geologists, of course,

352
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:44,740
<9-15,Sheldon>那只是因为我压根就没把那当回事儿

381
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:16,360
<10-7,On-screen Sheldon>仅仅用三维的思考方式  会限制我们的想象力
<10-7,On-screen Sheldon>It is only three dimensional thinking that limits our imagination.

386
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:32,680
<10-7,On-screen Sheldon>就能通过第四维度
<10-7,On-screen Sheldon>we could move our pants around our bodies

00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:35,910
<10-7,On-screen Sheldon>让裤子绕着身体转圈
<10-7,On-screen Sheldon>through the fourth dimension

388
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:39,920
<10-7,On-screen Sheldon>以后就再没脱裤子这么一说了
<10-7,On-screen Sheldon>and our days of dropping trousers would be over.

00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,120
<10-8,Sheldon>天哪
<10-8,Sheldon>Oh, Lord...
