<1-6,Monica>- What's the matter, honey? - My hand feels weird.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,930
<1-8,Monica>大概因为我订婚了
<1-8,Monica>I guess it's because I'm engaged!

11
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:37,070
<1-16,Ross>听我一句  作为一个大老爷们儿
<1-16,Ross>Take it from me. As a grown boy,

12
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,600
<1-16,Ross>你只需要按时出席婚礼并说对名字即可
<1-16,Ross>all you have to do is show up and try to say the right name.

13
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,370
<1-18,Chandler>-天啊那是什么  -天  婚礼手册
<1-18,Chandler>- What in God's name is that? - Oh, my God, the wedding book?

<1-19,Ross>4年级以后就没见过它啊
<1-19,Ross>I haven't seen that since fourth grade.

15
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,260
<1-20,Monica>这本手册里面有所有信息
<1-20,Monica>This baby has got everything.

16
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,310
<1-20,Monica>就拿婚礼地点举例吧
<1-20,Monica>Take, you know, locations, for instance,

17
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,290
<1-20,Monica>首先按照字母顺序排列  再按地理位置排
<1-20,Monica>first organized alphabetically, then geographically...

18
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,830
<1-20,Monica>再按占地面积排
<1-20,Monica>...then by square footage.

19
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,800
<1-21,Phoebe>好聪明
<1-21,Phoebe>That is so smart.

20
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,470
<1-21,Phoebe>别掺和  赶紧走
<1-21,Phoebe>Break it off. Break it off now.

32
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,250
<2-1,Ross>这可以充分证明
<2-1,Ross>That conclusively proves...

33
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:54,950
<2-1,Ross>《侏罗纪公园》的灵感是我先有的
<2-1,Ross>...that I had the idea for Jurassic Park first.

34
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,110
<2-1,Ross>我们来看看
<2-1,Ross>Let's take a look...

35
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,680
<2-3,Ross>菲比  你来干什么
<2-3,Ross>Phoebe, what are you doing here?

36
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,790
<2-4,Phoebe>我有事和你说  很紧急
<2-4,Phoebe>I need to talk to you. It's urgent.

37
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,450
<2-4,Phoebe>有关莫妮卡和钱德
<2-4,Phoebe>It's about Monica and Chandler.

38
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:06,090
<2-5,Ross>我的天  当然
<2-5,Ross>Oh, my God. Of course.

39
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:09,090
<2-5,Ross>我失陪一下
<2-5,Ross>Would you please excuse me for a moment?

40
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:12,930
<2-5,Ross>你们知道彼此从哪儿来的吗   何不
<2-5,Ross>Do you know each other's hometowns? Why don't you...?

41
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,270
<2-5,Ross>怎么回事
<2-5,Ross>What's going on?

42
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,180
<2-6,Phoebe>没什么  但是
<2-6,Phoebe>Well, not much. But...

43
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:20,070
<2-6,Phoebe>我想他们刚订婚
<2-6,Phoebe>I was just thinking that since they just got engaged...

44
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,570
<2-6,Phoebe>应该多给他们一些独处的时间
<2-6,Phoebe>...it would be nice if they have privacy.

45
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:26,440
<2-6,Phoebe>我可以搬去你家住几天吗
<2-6,Phoebe>So could I just move in with you for a couple days?

46
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:33,080
<2-7,Ross>好  但莫妮卡和钱德勒怎么了
<2-7,Ross>Okay, sure. But what's wrong with Monica and Chandler?

47
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:35,490
<2-8,Phoebe>没事  怎么了
<2-8,Phoebe>Nothing. Why?

48
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,250
<2-9,Ross>你说很紧急的
<2-9,Ross>Phoebe, you said it was urgent.

49
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:42,630
<2-10,Phoebe>是啊  我的电影5分钟后要开演了
<2-10,Phoebe>Yeah, it is. My movie starts in, like, five minutes.

50
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:49,970
<2-11,Ross>你知道我有一屋子的学生在这儿吗
<2-11,Ross>Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?

51
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,770
<2-12,Phoebe>抱歉  我太失礼了
<2-12,Phoebe>Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so rude.

52
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:55,940
<2-12,Phoebe>有人想要一起去看电影吗
<2-12,Phoebe>Does anyone want to come to the movies?

53
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,120
<3-1,Monica>我还没和我爸妈讲清楚预算
<3-1,Monica>I haven't cleared the budget with my parents...

54
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,480
<3-1,Monica>不过音乐部份的安排这样好不好
<3-1,Monica>...but tell me how this is for music,

55
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,950
<3-3,Monica>入场时用弦乐四重奏
<3-3,Monica>A string quartet for the processional,

56
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,450
<3-5,Monica>鸡尾酒会时安排爵士乐三重奏
<3-5,Monica>a jazz trio for cocktails...

57
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,960
<3-5,Monica>跳舞时用湾市摇滚
<3-5,Monica>...the Bay City Rollers for dancing...

58
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,100
<3-5,Monica>慢着  那是我六年级婚礼的计划
<3-5,Monica>Wait, that was for my sixth grade wedding.

59
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,380
<3-6,Chandler>怎样都不会成行了
<3-6,Chandler>You couldn't get them anyway.

60
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,900
<3-6,Chandler>伊恩不演出了  德瑞克
<3-6,Chandler>Lan doesn't even play anymore and Derek...

61
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,340
<3-6,Chandler>我不该知道德瑞克这个人的
<3-6,Chandler>Derek is a name I shouldn't know.

62
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:28,200
<3-7,Joey>莫妮卡  有抱起来更舒服一点的枕头吗
<3-7,Joey>Mon, do you have another pillow, something a little snugglier?

63
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,610
<3-8,Chandler>你为什么不回去你家  要在这里睡
<3-8,Chandler>Why are you napping over here instead of at your place?

64
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,910
<3-9,Joey>-因为阿鸭 -什么  阿鸭
<3-9,Joey>- The duck. - What... the duck?

65
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,480
<3-10,Rachel>那该死的阿鸭又做了什么
<3-10,Rachel>What the hell did the damn duck do now?

66
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:41,810
<3-11,Joey>它没有到处吐
<3-11,Joey>Well, he did not get sick somewhere in there...

67
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,320
<3-11,Joey>它立刻被发现  并妥当处理干净了
<3-11,Joey>...and it was immediately found and properly cleaned up.

68
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,230
<3-12,Chandler>我可以看吗
<3-12,Chandler>Do I get to look at this book...

69
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:51,700
<3-12,Chandler>还是只有婚礼相关人员可以看
<3-12,Chandler>...or is it just for people involved in the wedding?

70
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,660
<3-13,Monica>你当然可以看  我也需要你的意见
<3-13,Monica>Of course you can look at it. I want your opinion too.

71
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:56,970
<3-14,Chandler>来
<3-14,Chandler>Here you go.

72
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:59,730
<3-15,Monica>-桌子中间的花饰呢  -花饰
<3-15,Monica>- What about centerpieces? - Centerpieces!

73
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:03,000
<3-16,Chandler>-玫瑰还是百合  -绝对玫瑰
<3-16,Chandler>- Roses or lilies? - Definitely roses.

74
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:09,380
<3-17,Monica>更有婚礼气氛
<3-17,Monica>I think they're more "Wedding-y."

75
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,450
<3-18,Chandler>但明显应该选百合
<3-18,Chandler>But lilies are the clear choice.

76
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:16,320
<3-19,Monica>天啊  心有灵犀
<3-19,Monica>Oh, my God, it's like one mind.

77
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:22,260
<3-21,Joey>各位  各位  让我休息好不好
<3-21,Joey>Guys, guys, you gotta let me nap.

78
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:25,000
<3-21,Joey>不然我会脾气不好
<3-21,Joey>I'm gonna get cranky.

79
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:29,400
<3-22,Rachel>乔伊  走廊对面有极舒服的沙发
<3-22,Rachel>Joey, there's a perfectly good couch across the hall.

80
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,910
<3-23,Joey>是很不错
<3-23,Joey>Yes, it is perfectly good...

81
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:35,610
<3-23,Joey>但阿鸭没在上面吐过
<3-23,Joey>...and it is not one of the places the duck got sick.

82
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,700
<3-24,Rachel>什么
<3-24,Rachel>What?

83
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:42,220
<3-26,Rachel>-我要走了 -乔伊  阿鸭到底做了什么
<3-26,Rachel>- All right, I'm gonna go. - Joey, what did the duck do?

84
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,420
<3-27,Joey>我不知道  但它没吃你的面霜
<3-27,Joey>I don't know, but he did not eat your face cream.

85
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:00,440
<4-1,Joey>小朋友  你觉得如何
<4-1,Joey>Hey, little buddy. How you feeling?

86
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,500
<4-1,Joey>那面霜里到底有什么
<4-1,Joey>What the hell is in that face cream?

87
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,320
<4-1,Joey>好软
<4-1,Joey>That's so soft.

88
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:27,120
<4-1,Joey>有枕头套耶
<4-1,Joey>Pillowcases!

89
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:46,650
<4-1,Joey>"柔达看着扫烟囱的人 她的父亲是个传教士"
<4-1,Joey>"Zelda looked at the chimney sweep. Her father, the vicar..."

<4-1,Joey>她欲火中烧
<4-1,Joey>Her loins were burning.

93

<4-1,Joey>She threw caution to the wind and reached out and grabbed his..."

<6-13,Rachel>顺便说一句

<8-12,Mrs. Geller>-什么  -杰克你说  我开不了口
<8-12,Mrs. Geller>- What? - You tell her, Jack. I can't do it.

<8-13,Monica>你们有莫妮卡婚礼基金  对吧
<8-13,Monica>You have the Monica wedding fund, don't you?

<9-1,Monica>你用我的婚礼基金买海滩别墅了
<9-1,Monica>I can't believe it you spent my wedding fund on the beach house?

155
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:30,060
<9-2,Mrs. Geller>对不起  我们以为
<9-2,Mrs. Geller>We're sorry honey. We assumed...

156
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:33,130
<9-2,Mrs. Geller>如果你30岁以后结婚  你会自己付钱
<9-2,Mrs. Geller>...that if you got married after 30 you'd pay for it yourself.

157
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,960
<9-3,Monica>你们买海滩别墅时我才23岁
<9-3,Monica>You bought the beach house when I was 23.

158
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:38,490
<9-4,Mr. Geller>你在海滩享受了7年好时光
<9-4,Mr. Geller>So you've had seven years of beach fun...

159
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:40,960
<9-4,Mr. Geller>宝贝儿  那可是无价的
<9-4,Mr. Geller>...and you can't put a price on that sweetie.

00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:45,470
<9-5,Mrs. Geller>我们很抱歉
<9-5,Mrs. Geller>We really do feel bad about this.

161
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,510
<9-6,Mr. Geller>你和理查德交往的时候我们又开始存钱了
<9-6,Mr. Geller>We saved again when you dated Richard...

162
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,410
<9-6,Mr. Geller>后来你们分手了  我们就重新装修了厨房
<9-6,Mr. Geller>...then that went to hell, so we redid the kitchen.

163
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,770
<9-7,Monica>那我和钱德勒约会的时候呢
<9-7,Monica>What about me dating Chandler?

164
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:57,320
<9-8,Mrs. Geller>我们没觉得他会向你求婚
<9-8,Mrs. Geller>It was Chandler. We didn't think he'd propose.

165
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:02,290
<9-9,Chandler>明显刚吃饭时  我的酒喝得不够
<9-9,Chandler>Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal.

<9-10,Monica>我不相信我的婚礼基金竟然没了
<9-10,Monica>I can't believe there's no money for my wedding.

<9-11,Mrs. Geller>我们本来还有钱  要不是你爸
<9-11,Mrs. Geller>We might still have some money, if your father hadn't tried...

<9-11,Mrs. Geller>在网上卖冰毒的话
<9-11,Mrs. Geller>...to sell ice over the Internet.

169
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,690
<9-12,Mr. Geller>那看起来很简单
<9-12,Mr. Geller>It seemed like such a simple idea.

170
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,500
<9-13,Mrs. Geller>是愚蠢  杰克  不是简单是愚蠢
<9-13,Mrs. Geller>Stupid, Jack. The word is stupid.

00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:28,060
<12-13,Rachel>因为第一本在我们交往时被翻烂了
<12-13,Rachel>wore out my first copy when I was with you.

<12-17,Phoebe>我的按摩客户  亚瑟
<12-17,Phoebe>My massage client, Arthur.

248
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:55,290
<12-17,Phoebe>他女儿说我的一个员工
<12-17,Phoebe>His daughter said some guy that worked for me...

249
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,420
<12-17,Phoebe>替他做了很奇怪的按摩
<12-17,Phoebe>...gave him a really weird massage.

250
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:00,530
<12-18,Ross>我做了很专业的按摩
<12-18,Ross>I gave him an extremely professional massage.

251
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:04,120
<12-19,Phoebe>他说你用木汤匙戳他
<12-19,Phoebe>He said you poked at him with wooden spoons.

252
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:07,100
<12-20,Ross>好吧  不是传统的按摩
<12-20,Ross>Okay, so it wasn't a traditional massage.

253
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:10,430
<12-20,Ross>可是我有用筷子为他指压按摩
<12-20,Ross>But I did give him acupressure with a pair of chopsticks...

254
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,840
<12-20,Ross>并温和地用抹布给他去了角质
<12-20,Ross>...and I gently exfoliated him with a mop.

255
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:20,850
<12-21,Phoebe>他再也不会来了 你害我一星期少进帐八十元
<12-21,Phoebe>Well, he's never coming back. You just cost me $80 a week.

256
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:24,310
<12-22,Ross>是你的错  你没更改他约的时间
<12-22,Ross>This is your fault. You didn't move his appointment.

257
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:27,420
<12-23,Phoebe>我的错  你不必替他按摩的
<12-23,Phoebe>Oh, it's my fault? You didn't have to massage him.

258
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:28,680
<12-23,Phoebe>你可以打发他走的
<12-23,Phoebe>You could've sent him away.

259
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,980
<12-23,Phoebe>你不用拿玩具唐卡车在他背上滚来滚去的
<12-23,Phoebe>You could've not rolled Tonka trucks up and down his back.

260
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:36,290
<12-24,Ross>他说他很喜欢的
<12-24,Ross>He said he liked that!
