<1-3,Rachel>Do you wanna come?

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,850
<1-4,Phoebe>好啊  他挺性感的

00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,850
<1-5,Rachel>不  我也会去
<1-5,Rachel>Oh, no, I'll be there too.

5
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:17,650
<1-6,Phoebe>行  那么我们得想个暗号
<1-6,Phoebe>Okay. So we'll come up with some kind of signal.

6
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:19,770
<1-6,Phoebe>如果一切进行顺利  你可以离开
<1-6,Phoebe>If it's going well, you can take off.

7
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:22,710
<1-7,Rachel>不  我是要你过去陪我
<1-7,Rachel>No, I just need you there for support.

8
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:24,500
<1-7,Rachel>我还没有告诉他我怀孕了
<1-7,Rachel>I haven't told him that I'm pregnant yet.

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,090
<1-8,Phoebe>为什么
<1-8,Phoebe>Oh. Why not?

10
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:27,530
<1-9,Rachel>因为我知道他会气炸了
<1-9,Rachel>Because I know he's gonna flip out,

11
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:29,470
<1-9,Rachel>我讨厌他生气的样子
<1-9,Rachel>and I hate it when he's angry.

12
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:32,530
<1-10,Phoebe>瑞秋  这跟《爸爸别说教》如出一辙
<1-10,Phoebe>Rachel, this is all so "Papa Don't Preach."

14
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:34,720
<1-10,Phoebe>不  菲比  等一下  他非常严厉
<1-10,Phoebe>No, Phoebe, wait. He's a scary guy.

15
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:36,110
<1-11,Rachel>有次他抓到我抽烟
<1-11,Rachel>I mean, one time he caught me smoking.

16
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:37,890
<1-11,Rachel>他说如果他再看到我抽烟
<1-11,Rachel>He said if he ever saw me doing that again,

17
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,130
<1-11,Rachel>他就逼我把一整包烟吃掉
<1-11,Rachel>he'd make me eat the entire pack.

18
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,560
<1-12,Phoebe>那我一定得去
<1-12,Phoebe>Wow. Well, I will be there.

19
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:45,730
<1-13,Rachel>天啊  我不会让那个男人逼你把宝宝吃掉
<1-13,Rachel>Gosh, I'm not gonna let that man make you eat your baby!

20
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,380
<1-14,Phoebe>那个家伙是谁  我想我认识他
<1-14,Phoebe>Hey, who is that guy? I think I know him.

21
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:54,220
<1-15,Monica>-才怪  -你怎么会认识
<1-15,Monica>- No, you don't. - No, you don't.

22
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,480
<1-16,Rachel>天啊
<1-16,Rachel>Oh, my God!

23
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,830
<1-17,Phoebe>莫妮卡  他是你单身女郎派对上的脱衣舞男
<1-17,Phoebe>Monica, he's the stripper from your bachelorette party!

24
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,110
<1-18,Chandler>什么
<1-18,Chandler>Her what?

25
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:07,460
<1-19,Phoebe>你的秘密单身女郎派对
<1-19,Phoebe>Your secret bachelorette party.

26
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,220
<1-20,Chandler>你办了单身女郎派对
<1-20,Chandler>You had a bachelorette party?

27
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:12,500
<1-21,Phoebe>她用牙解开了他的丁字裤
<1-21,Phoebe>She untied his G-string with her teeth.

28
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:15,760
<1-21,Phoebe>谁快让我住嘴
<1-21,Phoebe>Somebody stop me!

29
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:20,220
<1-22,Chandler>我们不是说好不办单身汉或单身女郎派对吗
<1-22,Chandler>I thought we weren't having bachelor, bachelorette parties.

30
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,370
<1-22,Chandler>我们都觉得这个传统很愚蠢
<1-22,Chandler>We agreed that it's a silly tradition.

31
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:24,270
<1-23,Joey>那个传统棒极了
<1-23,Joey>It's a grand tradition!

32
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:27,650
<1-24,Monica>抱歉  她们给了我一个大惊喜
<1-24,Monica>I'm sorry. They surprised me.

33
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:29,260
<1-24,Monica>我真的没有办法
<1-24,Monica>There was nothing I could do.

34
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,590
<1-25,Rachel>你可以用手解嘛
<1-25,Rachel>Well, you could've untied it with your hands.

35
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:34,180
<1-26,Joey>这太不公平了
<1-26,Joey>This is so unfair.

36
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:37,150
<1-26,Joey>我非常想帮我最好的朋友办单身汉派对
<1-26,Joey>The one thing I wanted was to throw my best friend a bachelor party...

37
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:38,720
<1-26,Joey>却不能那么做
<1-26,Joey>...but I wasn't allowed to.

38
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,540
<1-26,Joey>我们只能一起去吃牛排
<1-26,Joey>All we got was a stupid steak dinner.

39
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,310
<1-27,Chandler>女服务生跟你回家睡了
<1-27,Chandler>You went home with the waitress.

40
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:46,050
<1-28,Joey>对  那一晚真的很美妙
<1-28,Joey>Yeah, that was a pretty good night.

41
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,310
<1-29,Chandler>我不敢相信你没有告诉我
<1-29,Chandler>I can't believe you didn't tell me.

42
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,620
<1-29,Chandler>你知道婚姻的两大支柱
<1-29,Chandler>You know that the two pillars of marriage

43
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,880
<1-29,Chandler>是公开跟诚实
<1-29,Chandler>are openness and honesty.

44
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,320
<1-30,Monica>我就知道送你那本书
<1-30,Monica>I knew giving you that book

45
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,660
<1-30,Monica>总有一天我自己会遭报应
<1-30,Monica>was gonna come back and bite me in the ass.

57
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:42,730
<2-1,Dr. Green>我帮大家点摩洛哥鸡肉怎么样
<2-1,Dr. Green>How about I order everyone the Moroccan chicken?

58
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,880
<2-2,Phoebe>我不吃肉
<2-2,Phoebe>Oh, I don't eat meat.

59
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,420
<2-3,Dr. Green>那是鸡肉
<2-3,Dr. Green>It's chicken!

60
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:49,170
<2-4,Phoebe>那个我也不吃
<2-4,Phoebe>I don't eat that either.

61
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:51,210
<2-5,Dr. Green>我一直都搞不懂你们女同志
<2-5,Dr. Green>I never understand you lesbians.

62
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:56,500
<2-5,Dr. Green>宝贝  告诉我  你最近怎么样
<2-5,Dr. Green>So, baby, tell me, what's new with you?

63
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,130
<2-6,Rachel>事实上...
<2-6,Rachel>Well, actually...

64
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:00,070
<2-7,Waiter>您的74年拉费红酒  先生
<2-7,Waiter>Your '74 Lafite, sir.

65
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:00,970
<2-7,Waiter>74年
<2-7,Waiter>'74?

66
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:03,490
<2-8,Dr. Green>我点的是75年的  那一年的酒味道醇美
<2-8,Dr. Green>I ordered the '75. That's a magnificent wine.

67
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,450
<2-8,Dr. Green>74年的酒烂透了
<2-8,Dr. Green>The '74 is sewage!

68
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,720
<2-8,Dr. Green>你为什么要给我上那么烂的酒
<2-8,Dr. Green>Why would you bring me sewage?

69
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,270
<2-8,Dr. Green>这个问题很难吗
<2-8,Dr. Green>Is that a hard question?

70
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,700
<2-8,Dr. Green>你是白痴吗  所以你才会来当服务生
<2-8,Dr. Green>Are you an idiot? Is that why you're a waiter?

71
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:15,720
<2-9,Waiter>这就是我告诉经理今晚不想为你服务的原因
<2-9,Waiter>This is why I told the manager i wouldn't wait on you tonight.

72
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,130
<2-10,Dr. Green>少来了  别那么幼稚
<2-10,Dr. Green>Oh, come on. Don't be such a baby.

73
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:24,480
<2-11,Rachel>你应该注意到了他真的很吓人
<2-11,Rachel>In case you didn't notice, that is a scary man.

74
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,770
<2-12,Phoebe>但他说得对  74年的酒真的很难喝
<2-12,Phoebe>He's right, though. The '74 is absolute piss.

75
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,580
<2-13,Rachel>这是个天大的错误  菲比
<2-13,Rachel>This was such a huge mistake.

76
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,740
<2-13,Rachel>我不敢告诉他  菲比  我做不到
<2-13,Rachel>I can't tell him, Phoebe. I can't. I can't. I can't.

77
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,690
<2-14,Phoebe>-瑞秋...  -没事  这样吧
<2-14,Phoebe>- Rachel... - No, it's okay. This is what's gonna happen.

78
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:38,050
<2-15,Rachel>我再等上几年
<2-15,Rachel>I'm gonna wait a couple of years,

79
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:41,070
<2-15,Rachel>然后宝宝会告诉他
<2-15,Rachel>and then the baby will tell him.

80
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,790
<2-16,Phoebe>怎么  让他拿宝宝撒气吗
<2-16,Phoebe>Why? So he can get mad at the baby?

81
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:47,120
<2-17,Rachel>那就是宝宝要解决的问题了
<2-17,Rachel>Hey, that is the baby's problem.

82
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,320
<2-17,Rachel>服务生没问题吧

<3-17,Chandler>...but you're really going down different ones.

128
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,780
<3-18,Joey>我要把那本书抢过来  拿它把你打死
<3-18,Joey>I'm gonna take that book and I'm gonna beat you to death with it.

129
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,670
<3-19,Monica>天啊  你一定会爱死我的
<3-19,Monica>Oh, my God, you are gonna love me so much.

130
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:35,250
<3-19,Monica>关于单身女郎派对的事  我真的很过意不去
<3-19,Monica>I felt bad about the bachelorette party thing...

131
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:38,400
<3-19,Monica>所以今晚你要办单身汉派对
<3-19,Monica>...so tonight you're gonna have a bachelor party.

132
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,070
<3-20,Chandler>什么
<3-20,Chandler>What?

133
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,750
<3-21,Monica>我在餐厅的同事给了我一个电话号码
<3-21,Monica>I got this number from this guy at work

134
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,370
<3-21,Monica>我雇了一个脱衣舞娘来跳舞给你看
<3-21,Monica>and I hired a stripper to come dance for you.

135
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:47,270
<3-21,Monica>我可以进太太名人堂了吧
<3-21,Monica>Am I going in the wife hall of fame or what?

136
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,910
<3-22,Chandler>亲爱的  这太疯狂了  我不要脱衣舞娘
<3-22,Chandler>Honey, that's crazy. I don't want a stripper.

137
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,720
<3-23,Joey>你能让她说完吗
<3-23,Joey>Will you let the lady talk?

138
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:56,120
<3-24,Monica>来吧  一定会很好玩的
<3-24,Monica>Come on, it'll be fun.

139
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,760
<3-24,Monica>这样会让我觉得好过一点
<3-24,Monica>It'll make me feel so much better.

140
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:02,110
<3-25,Chandler>听着  我很感激  但这样有点奇怪
<3-25,Chandler>Look, I appreciate it, but it's a little creepy.

141
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:03,740
<3-25,Chandler>我已经不是单身汉了
<3-25,Chandler>I'm not a bachelor anymore.

142
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,340
<3-26,Monica>别把它当成是单身汉派对
<3-26,Monica>Don't think of it as a bachelor party.

143
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:08,720
<3-26,Monica>把它当成是结婚两个月的礼物
<3-26,Monica>Think of it as a two-month anniversary present.

144
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,470
<3-27,Ross>当然  结婚一年是纸婚
<3-27,Ross>Sure. One year is paper,

145
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:13,010
<3-27,Ross>两个月的话可以看艳舞
<3-27,Ross>but two months is lap dance.

146
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,040
<3-28,Monica>拜托  我觉得好过意不去
<3-28,Monica>Please, I feel so bad.

147
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,350
<3-28,Monica>就去看看那个辣妹脱光衣服吧
<3-28,Monica>Just watch the hot woman get naked!

148
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:22,150
<3-29,Chandler>-好吧  但我这么做是为了你  -太帅了
<3-29,Chandler>- Fine, but I'm only doing this for you. - Yeah!

149
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:24,880
<3-31,Chandler>还有乔伊
<3-31,Chandler>And Joey.

150
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:27,890
<3-32,Monica>谢谢  你还想邀请谁
<3-32,Monica>Thank you. Who else do you wanna invite?

151
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:31,430
<3-33,Chandler>光罗斯跟乔伊就够丢脸了
<3-33,Chandler>No, no, no. Just Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough.

152
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:35,250
<3-34,Ross>抱歉  我没办法去  今晚我跟蒙娜有约
<3-34,Ross>Actually, sorry, I can't even make it. I'm seeing Mona tonight.

153
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,110
<3-35,Chandler>谁会为了假单身汉派对
<3-35,Chandler>I understand: who would cancel an actual date

154
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,000
<3-35,Chandler>取消真正的约会
<3-35,Chandler>just to go to a fake bachelor party?

155
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,560
<3-36,Joey>抱歉  我得取消今晚的约会  宝贝
<3-36,Joey>I'm sorry. I gotta cancel tonight, baby.

156
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,560
<4-1,Phoebe>抱歉我无法参加你想像出来的婚礼
<4-1,Phoebe>I'm sorry I won't make it to your imaginary wedding,

157
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,710
<4-1,Phoebe>那天我很忙
<4-1,Phoebe>but I'm busy that day.

158
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,090
<4-1,Phoebe>我得参加独角兽受洗礼跟小精灵的戒酒会
<4-1,Phoebe>I already have a unicorn baptism and a leprechaun bar mitzvah.

159
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:02,740
<4-2,Rachel>我知道  我乱了方寸
<4-2,Rachel>I know, I know. I panicked. I panicked.

160
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,260
<4-2,Rachel>我不想让他对着我大叫
<4-2,Rachel>I didn't want him to start yelling at me

161
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:07,690
<4-2,Rachel>把我当成74年拉图红酒
<4-2,Rachel>like I was some '74 Latour.

162
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:09,130
<4-2,Rachel>是拉费
<4-2,Rachel>It's Lafite.

163
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:13,000
<4-3,Phoebe>74年拉图红酒喝起来真的很不错
<4-3,Phoebe>The '74 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely.

164
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:18,780
<4-4,Rachel>好吧  他来了  我得告诉他  我会很坚强
<4-4,Rachel>All right, here he comes. I'm gonna tell him. I'm gonna be strong.

165
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:21,160
<4-5,Dr. Green>我刚刚给一个朋友打了电话
<4-5,Dr. Green>I just called a friend of mine.

166
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,610
<4-7,Dr. Green>我应该我可以在这么短的时间内
<4-7,Dr. Green>I think I may be able to book The Plaza

167
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:25,380
<4-7,Dr. Green>订到广场饭店
<4-7,Dr. Green>on short notice.

<4-7,Dr. Green>广场饭店
<4-7,Dr. Green>The Plaza?

170
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,640
<4-8,Rachel>爸爸
<4-8,Rachel>Oh, Daddy!

171
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:37,350
<4-8,Rachel>爸爸  我得跟你谈一谈  请坐
<4-8,Rachel>Right. Daddy, I need to talk to you. Please sit down.

<4-10,Rachel>-罗斯跟我不会结婚  -什么
<4-10,Rachel>- Ross and I aren't getting married. - What?

00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:45,560
<4-12,Rachel>-对不起  爸爸  -我不敢相信
<4-12,Rachel>- I'm sorry, Daddy. - I don't believe this!

176
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,190
<4-14,Rachel>爸爸  请保持冷静
<4-14,Rachel>Daddy, stay calm, please.

177

<4-15,Dr. Green>保持冷静  你叫我怎么保持冷静
<4-15,Dr. Green>Stay calm? How do you expect me to stay calm?

178
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:53,020
<4-15,Dr. Green>我完全无法接受  瑞秋  我要知道为什么
<4-15,Dr. Green>This is unacceptable, Rachel. And I wanna know why!

179
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:56,110
<4-15,Dr. Green>因为那个混蛋不愿意娶你吗
<4-15,Dr. Green>Is it because that punk Ross won't marry you?

180
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:59,460
<4-16,Rachel>-是那样吗  -对  他说我是瑕疵品
<4-16,Rachel>- That's it. Is that it? - Yes. He says I'm damaged goods.

181
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,070
<5-1,Joey>快结婚了  你很紧张吧
<5-1,Joey>So, you nervous about getting married?

182
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:15,860
<5-2,Chandler>你这是搞什么名堂
<5-2,Chandler>What are you doing?

183
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:20,240
<5-3,Joey>我们假装这是你结婚前的单身汉派对
<5-3,Joey>Let's pretend it's a real bachelor party, before your wedding.

184
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,310
<5-3,Joey>那样比较好玩
<5-3,Joey>It'll be more fun.

185
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:25,140
<5-4,Chandler>好吧  我不敢相信明天是我的大喜之日
<5-4,Chandler>All right. I can't believe tomorrow's the big day.

186
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,630
<5-5,Joey>知道你再也没法跟别的女人在一起
<5-5,Joey>How's it feel knowing you're never gonna

187
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,460
<5-5,Joey>你有什么感觉
<5-5,Joey>be with another woman again?

188
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,530
<5-5,Joey>知道你每天醒过来都会看到同一张脸
<5-5,Joey>Knowing you're gonna have to wake up to the same face every day...

189
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:38,390
<5-5,Joey>直到死神来拯救你
<5-5,Joey>...until you finally have the sweet release of death.

190
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,570
<5-6,Chandler>你说得对  这样比较好玩
<5-6,Chandler>You're right. This is more fun.

191
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,710
<5-7,Joey>她来了  快点
<5-7,Joey>That's her! Okay, come on!

<5-13,Joey>乔伊·崔比安尼  你的头号仰慕者
<5-13,Joey>Joey Tribbiani. Big fan.

196
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,180
<5-15,Chandler>-那是卧室吗  -对  就在那边
<5-15,Chandler>- Is that a bedroom? - Yeah, right over there.

197
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,840
<5-16,Stripper>好吧  你准备好就进来
<5-16,Stripper>All right. Whenever you're ready.

198
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,010
<5-17,Chandler>那好奇怪
<5-17,Chandler>That was weird.

199
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:21,550
<5-18,Joey>-她为什么要到卧室去  -我等着呢
<5-18,Joey>- Why would she go in the bedroom? - I'm waiting.

00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:40,820
<6-1,Mona>我喜欢你家  这玩意从哪里来的
<6-1,Mona>I love your place. Where is this guy from?

202
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:44,950
<6-2,Ross>那是在加尔各答买的18世纪印度工艺品
<6-2,Ross>That's an 18th-century Indian artifact from Calcutta.

203
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:51,110
<6-3,Mona>原来你不只喜欢研究恐龙
<6-3,Mona>So you're more than just dinosaurs.

204
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:53,140
<6-4,Ross>我涉猎很广的
<6-4,Ross>So much more.

205
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,210
<6-5,Mona>天啊  我很抱歉
<6-5,Mona>Oh, my God! I am so sorry!

206
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:04,050
<6-6,Ross>算了  那是在一号码头商店买的
<6-6,Ross>Forget it. It's from Pier 1.

207
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,460
<6-6,Ross>抱歉
<6-6,Ross>Sorry.

208
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,010
<6-7,Dr. Green>你以为你可以搞大我女儿的肚子
<6-7,Dr. Green>You think you can knock up my daughter

209
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,830
<6-7,Dr. Green>然后不娶她吗
<6-7,Dr. Green>and then not marry her?

210
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,770
<6-7,Dr. Green>我要杀了你
<6-7,Dr. Green>I'm gonna kill you!

211
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,600
<6-8,Ross>事实上  我现在真的很不方便
<6-8,Ross>You know, this is actually not a great time for me.

212
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:35,720
<7-1,Dr. Green>快解释给我听  盖勒
<7-1,Dr. Green>So come on. Explain yourself, Geller.

213
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,790
<7-1,Dr. Green>你先让我的瑞秋怀孕
<7-1,Dr. Green>First, you get my Rachel pregnant.

214
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:39,110
<7-2,Mona>你让瑞秋怀孕了
<7-2,Mona>You got Rachel pregnant?

215
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:40,270
<7-3,Ross>-谁干的  -就是你
<7-3,Ross>- Who did? - You did!

216
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,440
<7-4,Dr. Green>是的
<7-4,Dr. Green>Yes.

217
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:46,950
<7-5,Ross>没错  但那是一夜情  那毫无意义
<7-5,Ross>Yes, I did, but it was a one-night thing. It meant nothing.

218
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:50,700
<7-6,Dr. Green>真的吗  我女儿对你来说毫无意义
<7-6,Dr. Green>Oh? Really? That's what my daughter means to you, nothing?

219
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,040
<7-7,Ross>不是的  她对我来说意义重大
<7-7,Ross>No, sir. She means a lot to me.

220
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,890
<7-7,Ross>我在乎...我爱瑞秋
<7-7,Ross>I care... I love Rachel.

221
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:56,840
<7-9,Ross>-什么  -但不是那种爱
<7-9,Ross>- What? - But not that way.

222
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:00,950
<7-9,Ross>我没有爱上她  我把她当成朋友
<7-9,Ross>I'm not in love with her. I love her like a friend.

223
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:02,220
<7-10,Dr. Green>你就是那样对待朋友的吗
<7-10,Dr. Green>Really? That's how you treat a friend,

224
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,450
<7-10,Dr. Green>你搞大她的肚子又不肯娶她
<7-10,Dr. Green>you get her in trouble and refuse to marry her?

225
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:08,620
<7-11,Ross>我有跟她求婚  但我不是真心的
<7-11,Ross>Hey, I offered to marry her. But I didn't want to.

226
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,780
<7-12,Mona>为什么  因为你想跟这个荡妇鬼混
<7-12,Mona>Well, why not? So you could spend your time with this tramp?

227
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:14,900
<7-14,Dr. Green>荡妇
<7-14,Dr. Green>Tramp?

228
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,740
<7-15,Mona>抱歉
<7-15,Mona>I'm sorry.

229
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,410
<7-16,Ross>格林医生  蒙娜  蒙娜  格林医生
<7-16,Ross>Dr. Green, Mona. Mona, Dr. Green.

230
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:23,170
<8-1,Chandler>我不敢相信里面有个脱光衣服的妓女
<8-1,Chandler>I can't believe there is a naked hooker in there!

231
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:27,040
<8-2,Joey>或许她是妓女兼脱衣舞娘...
<8-2,Joey>Wait, wait. Maybe she's a hooker and a stripper...

232
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,840
<8-2,Joey>但她会搞不清楚该做什么
<8-2,Joey>...but she got confused about what's she supposed to do.

233
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,130
<8-3,Chandler>有可能  技术上来说她确实脱光了衣服
<8-3,Chandler>Could be. I mean, technically, she did strip.

234
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:34,820
<8-3,Chandler>只是我们错过了
<8-3,Chandler>We just missed it.

235
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,510
<8-3,Chandler>小姐
<8-3,Chandler>Ma'am?

236
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:42,940
<8-3,Chandler>你也是脱衣舞娘吗
<8-3,Chandler>Are you also a stripper?

237
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:46,920
<8-4,Hooker>不是  但我可以假装  那得另外收钱
<8-4,Hooker>No, but I can pretend to strip. But that's gonna cost extra.

238
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,930
<8-4,Hooker>这是另外收钱的项目  手拷  鞭打...
<8-4,Hooker>Okay, here's the extras: Handcuffs, spanking...

239
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,180
<8-5,Joey>或许莫妮卡是在跟你开玩笑
<8-5,Joey>Maybe Monica's playing a joke on you.

240
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:58,900
<8-5,Joey>帮自己老公找妓女  那真的很好笑
<8-5,Joey>You know? Getting her own husband a hooker. That's pretty funny.

241
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:03,580
<8-6,Chandler>是很好笑  或许我生日的时候她会去杀人
<8-6,Chandler>That is funny. Maybe for my birthday she'll murder someone.

242
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,360
<8-7,Joey>我敢说罗斯也知情
<8-7,Joey>I'll bet Ross was in on it too.

243
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,230
<8-7,Joey>他"刚好"很忙
<8-7,Joey>I mean, he was "conveniently" busy.

244
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:11,330
<8-8,Hooker>你不介意我抽烟吧
<8-8,Hooker>Do you mind if I smoke in here?

245
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:13,010
<8-9,Chandler>你还是不要...
<8-9,Chandler>Actually, I'd rather...

246
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,410
<8-9,Chandler>抽吧  反正我们也会烧掉那个房间
<8-9,Chandler>Yeah, go ahead. We're gonna have to burn that room down anyway.

247
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:21,640
<9-1,Mona>你为什么一直没有告诉我
<9-1,Mona>How could you have kept all this from me?

248
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,440
<9-2,Ross>我打算告诉你  但是...
<9-2,Ross>I was going to tell you, but...

249
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,640
<9-3,Dr. Green>但是什么  你以为你可以得到你要的
<9-3,Dr. Green>But what? You figure you'd get what you wanted,

250
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,310
<9-3,Dr. Green>然后像甩了瑞秋一样甩掉她
<9-3,Dr. Green>then you'd dump her like you did Rachel.

251
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:31,380
<9-4,Ross>我没有甩掉瑞秋  我们也没有在一起
<9-4,Ross>Hey, I did not dump Rachel. Nor are we still together.

252
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,480
<9-4,Ross>我可以...
<9-4,Ross>Can I...?

253
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:40,830
<9-4,Ross>让答录机接吧
<9-4,Ross>Why don't we just let the machine get that.

254
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,860
<9-5,Joey>罗斯  我是乔伊  这里有个妓女
<9-5,Joey>Hey, Ross, it's Joey. There's a hooker over here...

255
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:47,270
<9-5,Joey>我们想或许你知情
<9-5,Joey>...and we thought maybe you'd know something about it.

256
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,760
<9-6,Ross>不
<9-6,Ross>No! No! No!

257
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:54,420
<9-6,Ross>不  我需要躺一下
<9-6,Ross>No! I need to lie down.

258
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:01,660
<10-1,Stu>今晚是单身汉派对之夜
<10-1,Stu>So, tonight's the night of the big bachelor party?

259
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,640
<10-2,Monica>对  谢谢你给我那个女孩的电话号码
<10-2,Monica>Yeah. Thanks for giving me that girl's number.

260
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,190
<10-3,Stu>别客气  这是给谁办的派对
<10-3,Stu>No problem. Say, who's the party for?

261
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:09,170
<10-5,Stu>-我老公  -你帮你老公雇了一个妓女
<10-5,Stu>- For my husband. - You hired your husband a hooker?

262
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,580
<10-7,Stu>-她是脱衣舞娘  -不  她是妓女
<10-7,Stu>- She's a stripper. - No, she's a hooker.

263
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,280
<10-8,Monica>他们有时也这样称呼脱衣舞娘吗
<10-8,Monica>Is that what they call strippers sometimes?

264
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,020
<10-9,Stu>因为她们本身就是妓女
<10-9,Stu>When they're hookers.

265
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,620
<10-10,Monica>天啊  史都  我不敢相信你会这么做
<10-10,Monica>Oh, my God. Stu, I can't believe you did this.

266
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,670
<10-10,Monica>你确定她是妓女吗
<10-10,Monica>Now, you're absolutely sure she's a hooker?

267
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,400
<10-11,Stu>如果不是的话  那她就是我约过
<10-11,Stu>It's either that, or she's just the best,

268
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,900
<10-11,Stu>技术最好  价钱最贵的女孩
<10-11,Stu>most expensive date I ever had.

269
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,150
<11-1,Joey>或许她是故意帮你雇了个妓女
<11-1,Joey>Maybe she meant to get you a hooker.

270
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:36,290
<11-2,Chandler>她为什么要那么做
<11-2,Chandler>Why would she do that?

271
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:38,400
<11-3,Joey>或许她要你好好学一学
<11-3,Joey>Maybe she wants you to learn something.

272
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:44,960
<11-3,Joey>你在床上有表现不好的方面吗
<11-3,Joey>Is there anything you're really bad at, you know, sexually?

273
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,940
<11-4,Chandler>这个单身汉派对简直烂到家了
<11-4,Chandler>This is the worst bachelor party ever.

274
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:53,520
<11-5,Hooker>-你们怎么那么久  -再过一分钟就好
<11-5,Hooker>- What's taking you boys so long? - In a minute!

275
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,750
<11-7,Chandler>"一分钟"  一分钟内会发生什么事
<11-7,Chandler>"In a minute"? What's gonna happen in a minute?

276
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,710
<11-8,Joey>好吧  或许你该去请她离开
<11-8,Joey>All right. Maybe you should ask her to leave.

277
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:02,230
<11-10,Joey>-为什么是我  -这是你的单身汉派对
<11-10,Joey>- Why me? - Hey, it's your bachelor party.

278
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:04,220
<11-11,Chandler>所以应该是你去说
<11-11,Chandler>Which is why you should do it.

279
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,590
<11-12,Joey>我不要  你去
<11-12,Joey>I don't want to. You do it.

280
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:06,740
<11-13,Chandler>-你去  -你去
<11-13,Chandler>- You do it. - You do it.

281
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,210
<11-14,Joey>好吧  剪刀石头布
<11-14,Joey>All right. Rock, paper, scissors

282
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:10,150
<11-15,Chandler>决定谁去请那个妓女离开
<11-15,Chandler>for who has to tell the whore to leave.

283
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:15,490
<11-15,Chandler>怎么了
<11-15,Chandler>What?

284
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,680
<11-16,Joey>我想念这种日子
<11-16,Joey>I miss this.

285
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,170
<11-17,Chandler>我觉得我们以前根本没做过这种事
<11-17,Chandler>I don't think we've actually done this before.

286
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:23,800
<11-18,Joey>不  我想念跟你鬼混的日子
<11-18,Joey>No, I miss hanging out with you.

287
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:27,510
<11-19,Chandler>-我们还是混在一起  -跟以前不一样了
<11-19,Chandler>- We still hang out. - Not like we used to.

288
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:30,470
<11-20,Joey>还记得吗  你跟我我们以前老是黏在一起
<11-20,Joey>Remember? You and me, we used to be inseparable.

289
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:35,540
<11-20,Joey>现在一切都变得不一样了
<11-20,Joey>You know, now it's like things are different.

290
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:40,150
<11-21,Chandler>的确不一样了  我结婚了
<11-21,Chandler>Well, you know, things are different. I'm married now.

<12-5,Ross>我不在乎你爸  我在乎蒙娜
<12-5,Ross>I don't care about your dad. I care about Mona.

310
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:52,230
<12-5,Ross>当时她在场  都快气疯了
<12-5,Ross>She was there and now she's totally freaked out!

00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,890
<13-2,Mona>很好  你也在
<13-2,Mona>Oh, good. You're here.

320
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,880
<13-2,Mona>我还担心今天过来会闹得不痛快
<13-2,Mona>And I was worried that it was going to be uncomfortable.

321
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:30,080
<13-3,Rachel>不  蒙娜  听我说
<13-3,Rachel>No, Mona, just hear me out.

322
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,040
<13-3,Rachel>首先我很抱歉  我爸对你大叫
<13-3,Rachel>First of all, I am so sorry about my father yelling at you.

323
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,600
<13-3,Rachel>但我听说你控制住了自己的脾气
<13-3,Rachel>But I heard that you held your own.

324
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:37,640
<13-3,Rachel>你得告诉我你是怎么做到的
<13-3,Rachel>You have to tell me how you did that.

325
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:39,570
<13-4,Ross>-说重点  -好吧
<13-4,Ross>- Focus. - Okay.

326
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,140
<13-5,Rachel>罗斯跟我以前交往过
<13-5,Rachel>Yes, Ross and I used to date.

327
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:47,240
<13-5,Rachel>我们的确有宝宝了
<13-5,Rachel>And yes, we are gonna have a baby.

328
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:51,380
<13-5,Rachel>但我们绝对不可能复合
<13-5,Rachel>But we are definitely not getting back together.

329
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:52,920
<13-6,Mona>我怎么能相信你的话
<13-6,Mona>How can I be sure of that?

330
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,460
<13-7,Rachel>因为我们把彼此逼疯了
<13-7,Rachel>Because we drove each other crazy.

331
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,850
<13-8,Ross>他占有欲很强  爱吃醋
<13-8,Ross>He was possessive, he was jealous.

332
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:01,070
<13-9,Rachel>他从来都放不下那些小事
<13-9,Rachel>He could never just let the little things go.

333
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,580
<13-10,Ross>我还要跟这个女人交往呢
<13-10,Ross>Trying to date this woman.

334
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:08,800
<13-11,Rachel>但那都比不上他的温柔体贴
<13-11,Rachel>None of that compared to how kind and gentle...

335
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,270
<13-11,Rachel>无微不至
<13-11,Rachel>...and thoughtful he is.

336
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,950
<13-12,Ross>或许你不该碰我
<13-12,Ross>You probably shouldn't touch me.

337
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:18,020
<13-13,Mona>我不想介入这么复杂的事
<13-13,Mona>I don't wanna get in the middle of something so complicated.

338
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:19,300
<13-14,Rachel>我明白  但是蒙娜
<13-14,Rachel>I get it, but, Mona,

339
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,990
<13-14,Rachel>哪段感情不复杂呢
<13-14,Rachel>what relationship is not complicated?

340
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:24,970
<13-14,Rachel>我们都有自己的包袱  你也一样
<13-14,Rachel>We all have our baggage. You must too.

341
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:27,060
<13-14,Rachel>不然你为什么还是单身呢
<13-14,Rachel>Why else would you still be single?

342
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:30,070
<13-14,Rachel>我得走了
<13-14,Rachel>I'm so gonna leave right now.

343
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:36,370
<13-15,Ross>我应该为你把门开着吗
<13-15,Ross>Should I leave this open for you too?

344
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:40,610
<13-16,Mona>我还不确定  你为什么不告诉我
<13-16,Mona>I'm not sure yet. Why didn't you just tell me about all this?

345
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:41,850
<13-17,Ross>因为我跟瑞秋之间的事
<13-17,Ross>Because what's going on with Rachel

346
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:44,200
<13-17,Ross>跟我对你的感觉没有关系
<13-17,Ross>has nothing to do with how I feel about you.

347
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,710
<13-18,Mona>你还是应该告诉我
<13-18,Mona>You still should have told me.

348
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:47,930
<13-18,Mona>我知道  我打算那么做
<13-18,Mona>I know, and I was going to, but...

349
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:52,300
<13-19,Ross>但我想最好  还是让瑞秋的爸爸来告诉你
<13-19,Ross>I thought it was better that you heard it from Rachel's father.

350
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:56,580
<13-19,Ross>我犯了个错误...
<13-19,Ross>I made a mistake...
