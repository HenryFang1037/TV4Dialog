<2-5,Monica>我已经有一台了
<2-5,Monica>I already have one.

42
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:13,920
<2-6,Phoebe>除非有人借走了你那台  还丢在了妇产科医生那
<2-6,Phoebe>Unless someone borrowed it and left it at the gynecologist.

<2-12,Monica>是那个我外婆临死前让我发誓
<2-12,Monica>The one my grandma made me swear on her deathbed...

49
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:39,080
<2-13,Phoebe>一定不能外传的食谱吗
<2-13,Phoebe>...that I would never let out of our family?

50
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:42,910
<2-14,Chandler>快死的人都会胡言乱语
<2-14,Chandler>Dying people say the craziest things.

51
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,740
<2-15,Monica>多年来我一直想得到它
<2-15,Monica>I've wanted it for years.

00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,830
<2-15,Monica>我要做给我的孩子吃
<2-15,Monica>I was gonna make cookies for my children.

<2-16,Phoebe>真是割我心头肉啊  好吧
<2-16,Phoebe>Break my heart. Oh, all right.

54
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:53,120
<2-17,Monica>我即将成为

<2-18,Chandler>看来我们的孩子会是胖子
<2-18,Chandler>Our kids are gonna be fat, aren't they?

57
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,270
<2-19,Joey>啊喂

<2-21,Joey>-船上玩得怎么样  -出海真不错啊
<2-21,Joey>- How's the boat? - I'm getting into this sailing stuff.

59
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,280
<2-22,Monica>这次你终于驾船驶出码头了
<2-22,Monica>You finally took it out of the marina?

60
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:09,320
<2-23,Joey>我为什么要那么做
<2-23,Joey>Why would I do that?

61
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,880
<2-23,Joey>我找了3个人才把它送进码头
<2-23,Joey>It took three guys to get the thing in there.

62
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:15,810
<2-24,Phoebe>如果你不想开它出海 你在船上都做些什么呢
<2-24,Phoebe>If you don't sail it, what do you do on it?

63
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,820
<2-25,Joey>光是坐在那里就很舒服了
<2-25,Joey>It's a great place to just sit...

64
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,520
<2-25,Joey>我什么都不做  就喝啤酒吃薯片
<2-25,Joey>...hang around, drink a few beers, eat some chips.

65
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:26,330
<2-26,Chandler>恭喜你终于找到可以做这些事的地方了
<2-26,Chandler>It's good that you finally have a place to do that.

66
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:29,400
<2-27,Rachel>如果你想  我可以教你驾船
<2-27,Rachel>I could teach you to sail if you want.

67
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,900
<2-28,Joey>-你会驾船  -我从小就开始驾船了
<2-28,Joey>- You could? - I've been sailing my whole life.

68
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:35,200
<2-29,Rachel>我十五岁时  我爸送我一艘船
<2-29,Rachel>When I was 15, my dad bought me my own boat.

69
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,840
<2-30,Phoebe>-你有一艘船   -不行吗  他想要安慰我
<2-30,Phoebe>- Your own boat? - He was trying to cheer me up.

70
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:40,710
<2-31,Rachel>我的小马生病了
<2-31,Rachel>My pony was sick.

71
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,420
<3-1,Chandler>-你知道我在想什么吗   -什么
<3-1,Chandler>- You know what I was thinking? - What?

72
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,990
<3-3,Chandler>没事  就是想这么做
<3-3,Chandler>Nothing, I just like to go like this.

73
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,300
<3-4,Ross>-今晚你要做什么   -你有讲座吗
<3-4,Ross>- What are you doing tonight? - Do you have a lecture?

74
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:04,700
<3-7,Chandler>-没啊  怎么  -那我闲得很  怎么了
<3-7,Chandler>- No, why? - Then, free as a bird. What's up?

75
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,740
<3-8,Ross>我爸想约你去打壁球
<3-8,Ross>My dad wants to know if you want to play racquetball.

76
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,700
<3-9,Monica>太棒了  爸一定很喜欢你
<3-9,Monica>That's great! Dad must like you!

77
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,610
<3-9,Monica>他从来不会约人去打壁球
<3-9,Monica>He doesn't ask just anyone to play.

78
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:14,080
<3-10,Ross>他没说是你  就是要找"钱西"
<3-10,Ross>He didn't ask for you. He asked for "Chauncey."

79
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:16,580
<3-10,Ross>我觉得应该是你
<3-10,Ross>I assumed he meant you.

80
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,680
<3-11,Chandler>你纠正他了吗
<3-11,Chandler>Did you correct him?

81
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,440
<3-12,Ross>没有  我觉得那样子比较好玩
<3-12,Ross>No, I thought it would be more fun this way.

82
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,360
<3-13,Monica>酷了  或许你们每周都该一起打球
<3-13,Monica>Cool! Maybe you could do this every week.

83
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:26,850
<3-14,Ross>你也可以坐在走廊上
<3-14,Ross>Or you could sit on the porch...

84
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:29,220
<3-14,Ross>确定没人偷垃圾桶
<3-14,Ross>...and make sure no one steals the trashcans.

85
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,960
<3-14,Ross>这也是他每周的行程之一
<3-14,Ross>He does that every week too.

86
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:37,130
<3-15,Monica>但你得让他赢  他最讨厌输了
<3-15,Monica>Just so you know, you have to let him win. He hates to lose.

87
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,770
<3-18,Chandler>或许我该用左手打球
<3-18,Chandler>Maybe I'll play with my left hand.

88
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,270
<3-19,Ross>你不就是左撇子吗
<3-19,Ross>You're not a lefty?

89
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,410
<3-20,Chandler>有人认识我吗
<3-20,Chandler>Does anybody know me?

90
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:51,440
<3-21,Monica>怎么了
<3-21,Monica>What's wrong?

91
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,090
<3-22,Phoebe>我刚到以前的公寓拿饼干食谱
<3-22,Phoebe>I went to my old apartment to get the cookie recipe...

92
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:57,780
<3-22,Phoebe>一场愚蠢的大火把它烧了
<3-22,Phoebe>...and that stupid fire burned it up!

93
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:01,860
<3-23,Monica>不  你为什么没有影印一份放在防火的盒子里
<3-23,Monica>No! Why didn't you make a copy and keep it in a fireproof box...

94
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,090
<3-23,Monica>并将其放在离原版至少一百码的地方呢
<3-23,Monica>...and keep it at least 100 yards away from the original?

95
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:13,400
<3-24,Phoebe>因为我很正常
<3-24,Phoebe>Because I'm normal.

96
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,740
<3-24,Phoebe>那是我外婆留给我的唯一遗产
<3-24,Phoebe>That was the one legacy my grandmother left me.

97
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,780
<3-24,Phoebe>我也知道你想要它当订婚礼物
<3-24,Phoebe>And I know you wanted it as an engagement present.

98
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:23,140
<3-25,Ross>我们得送你们订婚礼物
<3-25,Ross>We have to get you an engagement present?

99
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,380
<3-26,Chandler>别担心
<3-26,Chandler>Don't worry about it.

100
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:28,110
<3-27,Ross>可没人送我订婚礼物
<3-27,Ross>No one got me an engagement present.

101
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:32,280
<3-27,Ross>我没有食谱  但这个给你
<3-27,Ross>I don't have the recipe, but here.

102
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:34,960
<3-28,Phoebe>祝你们健康快乐
<3-28,Phoebe>I wish you health and happiness.

103
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:37,690
<3-29,Chandler>一块放了很久的饼干
<3-29,Chandler>An old cookie?

104
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,470
<3-30,Monica>不列出礼物清单 就是会发生这种事
<3-30,Monica>This is what happens when you don't register for gifts.

105
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:47,470
<3-31,Phoebe>我做了一些饼干冷冻了起来  这是最后一块
<3-31,Phoebe>I made a batch and froze it. This is the only one left.

106
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:48,940
<3-32,Chandler>我们不能收
<3-32,Chandler>We can't accept this.

107
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,130
<3-33,Phoebe>为什么
<3-33,Phoebe>Why not?

108
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:53,140
<3-34,Chandler>因为它很恶心
<3-34,Chandler>Because it's gross.

109
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:57,110
<3-35,Monica>等一下  我想我可用这块饼干猜出整个食谱
<3-35,Monica>No, wait. I think I can figure out the recipe from this cookie.

110
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,010
<3-35,Monica>我在工作时常常这么做
<3-35,Monica>I do this at work all the time.

111
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:00,410
<3-37,Monica>-真的吗  -我想我可以做到
<3-37,Monica>- Really? - I think so!

112
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,220
<3-38,Chandler>好吧罗斯  我们欠你一份礼物
<3-38,Chandler>Okay, Ross, we owe you a present.

113
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,830
<3-39,Ross>是两份  我订过两次婚
<3-39,Ross>Two! I've been engaged twice.

114
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,300
<4-1,Joey>快来看看这个小丑
<4-1,Joey>Look at this clown.

115
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:23,810
<4-1,Joey>他以为他拿了个大点儿的球  就能主宰整条河了
<4-1,Joey>He thinks he got a bigger ball, so he can take up the whole river.

116
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,710
<4-1,Joey>闪开  混球
<4-1,Joey>Get out of the way, jackass!

117
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,140
<4-1,Joey>话说回来谁会把自己的船命名为海岸防卫队的
<4-1,Joey>Who names their boat Coast Guard, anyway?

118
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:35,550
<4-2,Rachel>他们就是海岸防卫队
<4-2,Rachel>That is the Coast Guard.

119
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,850
<4-3,Joey>他们在这里做什么
<4-3,Joey>What are they doing here?

120
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:39,250
<4-3,Joey>海岸在那边
<4-3,Joey>The coast is all the way over there.

121
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,650
<4-4,Rachel>乔伊  别管那些船
<4-4,Rachel>Joey, just ignore the boats.

122
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,090
<4-4,Rachel>-我们的课还没有上完  -好吧
<4-4,Rachel>- We're not finished with our lesson. - All right.

<4-6,Rachel>我要帮你复习一下基本要点
<4-6,Rachel>I'm gonna go over the basic points one more time, you ready?

124
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:48,730

126
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,200
<4-7,Joey>我想把船开到那一船女孩旁边去
<4-7,Joey>I want to go over there where that boatload of girls is.

127
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:57,230
<4-8,Rachel>是这样是吗  你只不过想
<4-8,Rachel>Is that what you wanna do? You want to give...

128
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,470
<4-8,Rachel>和那些性感姑娘打个招呼

<4-9,Joey>-船上的绳子  -错了
<4-9,Joey>- Boat rope? - Wrong!

134
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:21,130
<4-12,Rachel>不  如果我说我们要转向了  你该怎么办
<4-12,Rachel>No. What do you do if I say we're coming about?

135
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,270
<4-13,Joey>我说"再来一下"
<4-13,Joey>I say, "Come again?"

136
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,500
<4-13,Joey>我知道  这一题我会
<4-13,Joey>I know this one. I know this one.

137

<4-14,Rachel>时间到  现在你死了
<4-14,Rachel>Time's up. Now you're dead.

138
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,010
<4-15,Joey>也聋了
<4-15,Joey>And deaf!

139
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:34,150
<4-16,Rachel>你继续开玩笑吧
<4-16,Rachel>You go on and make your little jokes.

140
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,870
<4-16,Rachel>如果你不知道如何航海
<4-16,Rachel>If you don't know what you're doing...

141
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,380
<4-16,Rachel>就会没命  你听懂了吗水手
<4-16,Rachel>...you will die. Am I getting through to you, sailor?

142
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,450
<4-18,Rachel>-懂了  -别只是说你懂了
<4-18,Rachel>- Yes. - Don't just say yes.

143
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,150
<4-18,Rachel>这不是游戏  你很可能会受伤
<4-18,Rachel>This isn't a game. You could get hurt out here!

144
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:48,220
<4-18,Rachel>你想集中注意力听我说话呢  还是想死呢
<4-18,Rachel>Do you want to pay attention, or do you want to die?

145
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:54,300
<4-19,Joey>我想从船上打电话给钱德勒
<4-19,Joey>I want to make a ship-to-shore call to Chandler.

146
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,580
<5-1,Monica>-我吃到了肉豆蔻  -真的吗
<5-1,Monica>- I definitely taste nutmeg. - You do?

147
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:09,250
<5-3,Monica>你没吃到吗   那就是
<5-3,Monica>You don't? Well, that's the difference...

148
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:11,610
<5-3,Monica>专家跟外行人的不同
<5-3,Monica>...between a professional and a layman.

149
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:14,980
<5-4,Phoebe>没错  专家还很傲慢
<5-4,Phoebe>That and arrogance.

150
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,180
<5-5,Joey>嗨
<5-5,Joey>Hey.

151
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:19,950
<5-6,Monica>出海好玩吗
<5-6,Monica>Hey. How was sailing?

152
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,650
<5-7,Joey>我不想谈这件事
<5-7,Joey>I don't want to talk about it.

153
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:25,590
<5-7,Joey>你们至少可以留一整块饼干给我
<5-7,Joey>You could've at least saved me a cookie.

154
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,630
<5-9,Joey>女人太恶劣了
<5-9,Joey>Women are mean!

155
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,600
<5-10,Phoebe>我不敢相信
<5-10,Phoebe>I can't believe that.

156
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:41,180
<5-10,Phoebe>现在我外婆的遗产只剩下
<5-10,Phoebe>Now the only thing left of my grandmother's legacy is...

157
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,940
<5-10,Phoebe>这块碎屑
<5-10,Phoebe>...this crumb.

158
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:47,720
<5-10,Phoebe>祝你们白头偕老  婚姻美满
<5-10,Phoebe>I wish you a long and happy marriage.

00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:55,390
<5-13,Ross>我玩得很开心
<5-13,Ross>Well, I had a great time.

161
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,990
<5-13,Ross>但是钱西
<5-13,Ross>Chauncey, on the other hand...

162
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,190
<5-14,Chandler>我来说我来说
<5-14,Chandler>I will tell the story.

163
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:03,530
<5-14,Chandler>本来挺好  我让他赢  相处甚欢
<5-14,Chandler>It was going great. I let him win, we were bonding...

164
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,630
<5-14,Chandler>甚至说我可以叫他爸爸
<5-14,Chandler>...he even said I could call him Dad.

165
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,640
<5-15,Ross>他要你别叫他什么
<5-15,Ross>And what did he ask you not to call him?

166
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,040
<5-16,Chandler>爹地
<5-16,Chandler>Daddy.

167
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:13,180
<5-16,Chandler>事情是这样的
<5-16,Chandler>Look, here's the story.

168
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:18,540
<5-16,Chandler>我们打完球  决定去蒸气浴
<5-16,Chandler>We had just finished playing, and we were gonna take a steam.

169
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:19,840
<5-16,Chandler>我走进蒸汽室
<5-16,Chandler>I walk into the room...

170
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:22,110
<5-16,Chandler>里面雾气弥漫
<5-16,Chandler>...and it's really steamy.

171
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:27,850
<5-16,Chandler>于是我拿下眼镜  悲剧发生了
<5-16,Chandler>So I take off my glasses, and that's when it happened.

172
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,120
<6-1,Chandler>你们在哪
<6-1,Chandler>Guys?

173
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:32,230
<6-3,Mr. Geller>-这边  -坐这吧孩子
<6-3,Mr. Geller>- Over here. - Have a seat, son.

174
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,490
<6-3,Mr. Geller>嘿
<6-3,Mr. Geller>Hey!

175
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,460
<7-1,Monica>-我的天啊我简直不敢相信  -我知道
<7-1,Monica>- Oh, my God! I can't believe it. - I know.

176
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:55,160
<7-2,Chandler>你给我爸跳大腿舞
<7-2,Chandler>You gave my father a lap dance.

177
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,090
<7-3,Monica>他们为什么要把那里弄的雾气弥漫
<7-3,Monica>Why do they put so much steam in there?

178
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:07,400
<7-4,Chandler>不那么做的话  那里只能叫做"房间"
<7-4,Chandler>Because otherwise they'd have to call it the "Room" Room.

179
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:12,970
<7-5,Ross>为什么   为什么会发生那种事
<7-5,Ross>Why? Why did that have to happen?

180
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,410
<7-6,Chandler>别这样  那没有什么大不了的
<7-6,Chandler>Come on, it's not that big a deal.

181
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,980
<7-7,Phoebe>那没有什么大不了的
<7-7,Phoebe>Not that big a deal?

182
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,620
<7-8,Chandler>那种触摸的感觉
<7-8,Chandler>There was touching of things.

183
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,980
<7-9,Ross>我知道你想和我爸搞好关系
<7-9,Ross>I know you wanted to bond with my dad...

184
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,390
<7-9,Ross>但你一定要从他那个地方开始吗
<7-9,Ross>...but did you have to bond to that part?

185
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,390
<7-10,Monica>我相信爸不会在乎的
<7-10,Monica>I'm sure Dad doesn't care.

186
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,120
<7-10,Monica>或许他会觉得很好笑
<7-10,Monica>He probably thought it was funny.

187
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,130
<7-10,Monica>会把这个故事讲好多年
<7-10,Monica>He'll be telling this story for years.

188
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:38,130
<7-11,Chandler>我就是不希望他把这个故事讲好多年
<7-11,Chandler>I don't want him to tell this story for years.

189
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,740
<7-12,Ross>他会的
<7-12,Ross>Oh, but he will.

190
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:42,950
<7-12,Ross>他还在讲
<7-12,Ross>He still tells the story

191
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:45,640
<7-12,Ross>莫妮卡试图逃出减肥营的故事
<7-12,Ross>about how Monica tried to escape from fat camp.

192
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,610
<7-13,Monica>我才没有
<7-13,Monica>I wasn't escaping.

193
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,080
<7-14,Ross>那你怎么会被卡在铁丝网上的
<7-14,Ross>Then how'd you get caught in the barbed wire?

194
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,950
<7-15,Monica>我想要救一只松鼠
<7-15,Monica>I was trying to help out a squirrel.

195
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,950
<7-16,Ross>你想吃掉它
<7-16,Ross>You were trying to eat it.

196
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,120
<7-17,Chandler>如果那是你爸打来告诉你这件事
<7-17,Chandler>If that is your father calling to tell this story...

197
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:04,090
<7-17,Chandler>我们就不结婚了
<7-17,Chandler>...then the marriage is off!

198
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,660
<7-18,Monica>得了啦  喂
<7-18,Monica>Come on. Hello.

199
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:09,730
<7-18,Monica>对不起  你打错电话了
<7-18,Monica>I'm sorry, you have the wrong number.

200
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:11,870
<7-18,Monica>我待会回你电话  爸  我爱你
<7-18,Monica>I'll call you later, Dad. I love you.

201
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,150
<8-1,Chandler>我要去见你爸
<8-1,Chandler>I'm off to see your dad.

202
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,380
<8-2,Ross>你不会穿太多了吗
<8-2,Ross>Aren't you a little overdressed?

203
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,840
<8-3,Rachel>记得拿小费
<8-3,Rachel>You better make sure he tips you this time.

204
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,100
<8-4,Chandler>我想说服他
<8-4,Chandler>I figured I would try to

205
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:32,250
<8-4,Chandler>别再提那件事
<8-4,Chandler>convince him not to tell the story anymore...

206
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:35,360
<8-4,Chandler>我想最好的办法就是跟他面对面谈一谈
<8-4,Chandler>...and I figured the best way to do that was face to face.

207
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:38,120
<8-4,Chandler>我说的"面"指的不是他的大腿
<8-4,Chandler>And by "Face," I don't mean his lap.

208
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,200
<8-4,Chandler>而对的那个"面"  也不是我的屁股
<8-4,Chandler>And by "Face," I don't mean my ass.

210
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:49,370
<8-6,Rachel>我不知道  他们可没有送我们礼物
<8-6,Rachel>I don't know. You know, they didn't get us anything.

211
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,200
<8-7,Ross>谢谢
<8-7,Ross>Thank you!

212
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,340
<8-8,Joey>嘿
<8-8,Joey>Hey.

213
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:56,080
<8-9,Ross>你好啊
<8-9,Ross>Well, hello.

214
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,180
<8-10,Rachel>我们什么时候再出航  伙伴
<8-10,Rachel>So when are we getting back out on the water, matey?

215
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:03,580
<8-11,Joey>我不知道水手是怎么说的  但我死都不要
<8-11,Joey>I don't know the boat way to say this, but never!

216
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:06,550
<8-12,Rachel>为什么
<8-12,Rachel>Why not?

217
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:09,160
<8-13,Joey>因为你在船上很刻薄
<8-13,Joey>Because you're mean on the boat.

218
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,590
<8-14,Rachel>我只是想教会你
<8-14,Rachel>I was just trying to teach you.

219
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:14,230
<8-15,Joey>我学会了  瑞秋很刻薄
<8-15,Joey>Well, lesson learned. Rachel is mean.

220
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,330
<8-16,Ross>对对对
<8-16,Ross>Yep, yep, yep.

221
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,570
<8-16,Ross>我还记得她驾驶她爸的船带我出海
<8-16,Ross>I remember when she took me out on her dad's boat.

222
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,710
<8-16,Ross>她完全不让我插手
<8-16,Ross>She wouldn't let me help at all.

223
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,880
<8-17,Rachel>对不起  我想要你帮我
<8-17,Rachel>Excuse me, I wanted you to help.

224
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,310
<8-17,Rachel>但你连动都动不了
<8-17,Rachel>But you couldn't move...

225
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:30,520
<8-17,Rachel>为你穿了三件救生衣
<8-17,Rachel>...because you were wearing three life jackets.

226
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,580
<8-18,Ross>你得保持对大海的敬畏之心
<8-18,Ross>You have to respect the sea.

227
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,820
<8-19,Rachel>乔伊  如果你觉得我很刻薄  对不起
<8-19,Rachel>Joey, I'm sorry if you thought that was mean.

228
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:41,080
<8-19,Rachel>但我告诉你  那不是刻薄
<8-19,Rachel>But I tell you, that was not mean.

229
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,230
<8-19,Rachel>我爸才刻薄  以前在船上 他总会对我大吼大叫
<8-19,Rachel>My father is mean. He used to always yell at me on the boat.

230
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:48,560
<8-19,Rachel>那真的很可怕  我只是想当个称职的老师
<8-19,Rachel>It was horrible. I was being a really good teacher.

231
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:51,640
<8-20,Joey>好老师会说"放下那罐啤酒  猪头"吗
<8-20,Joey>Does a good teacher say, "Put down the beer, pinead!"

232
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:55,900
<8-21,Rachel>好学生会在上第一堂课时喝掉七罐啤酒
<8-21,Rachel>Does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson?

233
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,640
<8-22,Joey>是六罐半
<8-22,Joey>Six and a half.

234
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:00,150
<8-22,Joey>你把最后一罐从我手里打翻了  记得吗
<8-22,Joey>You knocked the last one out of my hand, remember?

235
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,280
<8-23,Rachel>我不希望你被船杆打中
<8-23,Rachel>I didn't want you to get hit by the boom.

236
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,850
<8-24,Joey>它的确打中我了
<8-24,Joey>Well, it hit me anyway.

237
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:07,250
<8-24,Joey>如果我能喝完最后一罐啤酒或许就不会那么痛
<8-24,Joey>It would have hurt a lot less if I had finished that last beer.

238
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:13,390
<8-25,Rachel>对不起  我会试着小声点不再对你大吼大叫
<8-25,Rachel>I'm sorry. I will try to tone it down and stop yelling.

239
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:15,460
<8-26,Joey>不会再颐指气使了吗
<8-26,Joey>No bossing me around?

240
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,460
<8-27,Rachel>-不会了  -会很和蔼吗
<8-27,Rachel>- I won't boss you around. - And be nice?

241
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,360
<8-27,Rachel>-会很和蔼  -不穿上衣
<8-27,Rachel>- I'll be nice. - You'll be topless?

242
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:22,920
<8-27,Rachel>-乔伊  -你不是想让我好好学嘛
<8-27,Rachel>- Joey! - You want me to learn?

243
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:32,380
<9-1,Monica>这是第二十二批 或许它们会有你外婆的神髓
<9-1,Monica>Here's batch 22. Maybe these are like your grandma's.

244
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:35,480
<9-1,Monica>我放了一些桔子皮  没有放肉豆蔻
<9-1,Monica>This has a bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.

245
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,380
<9-2,Ross>试吃吧
<9-2,Ross>Let's give it a shot.

246
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,310
<9-3,Monica>自从九年级后我再也没做过这么多饼干
<9-3,Monica>I haven't made so many cookies since 9th grade.

247
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,110
<9-4,Phoebe>那时候为什么做  饼干义卖吗

<9-10,Ross>对  第17批确实好吃
<9-10,Ross>Oh, yeah, batch 17 was good.

254
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:03,430
<9-10,Ross>我可不喜欢第16批
<9-10,Ross>I did not like batch 16.

255
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,540
<9-10,Ross>我没事
<9-10,Ross>I'm okay.

<9-11,Phoebe>第17批还有剩吗  我们可以研究那些啊
<9-11,Phoebe>Any more from the good batch? We could work off those.

260
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:36,230
<10-1,Rachel>现在你要站到左舷去
<10-1,Rachel>I just need you to step to the portside.

00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:44,070
<10-1,Rachel>还记得左舷是哪一边吗

264
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:52,590
<10-5,Rachel>是左亲爱的  但没关系  那一题太难了
<10-5,Rachel>It's left, sweetie, but that's okay. That's a tough one.

265
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:54,220
<10-6,Joey>干嘛不直接说左边呢
<10-6,Joey>Why not just say left?

266
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,190
<10-7,Rachel>好  左边

269
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:06,160
<10-10,Joey>看到没   你又在大吼大叫了
<10-10,Joey>You're yelling again. See that?

270
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:10,330
<10-11,Rachel>不我很小声  语气充满了爱意 我没有大吼大叫
<10-11,Rachel>Oh, no, no. Very quiet. Said with love, no yelling.

271
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,850
<10-11,Rachel>你知道吗   既然我已经坐在这里
<10-11,Rachel>You know what? Since I'm here,

272
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:17,480
<10-12,Joey>我要在左舷喝一罐啤酒
<10-12,Joey>I'm gonna have a beer on the portside.

273
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,480
<10-12,Joey>你看到我刚刚做了什么吗
<10-12,Joey>See what I did there?

274
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:27,230
<10-13,Rachel>风有点大  麻烦你把船绳拉紧
<10-13,Rachel>We're luffing a little. Can you tighten up the Cunningham?

275
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:31,520
<10-14,Joey>你说了一堆我听不懂的话
<10-14,Joey>You just said a bunch of stuff I don't know.

276
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:34,430
<10-15,Rachel>乔伊  别这样  我刚刚才教过你
<10-15,Rachel>Joey, come on! We just went over this.

277
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,600
<10-16,Joey>你教我的时候  有只鸟  嘴巴里
<10-16,Joey>We did that when that bird...

278
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,890
<10-16,Joey>叨着鱼飞过去
<10-16,Joey>...flew over with the fish in his mouth.

279
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,800
<10-16,Joey>你看到了吗   那真的很恶心
<10-16,Joey>Did you see it? It was gross.

<10-17,Rachel>我没有看到鸟或鱼
<10-17,Rachel>I did not see the bird or the fish!

282
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,880
<10-17,Rachel>我没有看到 因为我忙着教你驾驶船只
<10-17,Rachel>I did not, because I was trying to teach you how to sail a boat.

283
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,920
<10-17,Rachel>很明显那是不可能的任务
<10-17,Rachel>Which obviously is an impossible thing to do.

284
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,220
<10-18,Joey>你在大吼大叫  而且你没有脱掉上衣

<10-25,Rachel>我没有  我只是在离你比较近的地方大吼大叫
<10-25,Rachel>No, I'm not yelling at you. I'm just yelling near you.

337
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,290
<11-17,Monica>研究那份食谱
<11-17,Monica>...two days figuring out that recipe.

338

342
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:21,910
<12-1,Chandler>如果你可以不把那件事说出去 我会觉得舒服一点
<12-1,Chandler>I'd feel better if you didn't tell what happened.

343
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:24,980
<12-1,Chandler>我觉得很不好意思
<12-1,Chandler>I'm a little embarrassed about it.

344
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:27,150
<12-2,Mr. Geller>我完全理解
<12-2,Mr. Geller>I understand completely.

345
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:28,570
<12-2,Mr. Geller>最可怕的事
<12-2,Mr. Geller>Nothing's scarier

346
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:31,090
<12-2,Mr. Geller>莫过于在岳父母面前丢脸了
<12-2,Mr. Geller>than embarrassing yourself in front of your in-laws.

347
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,650
<12-2,Mr. Geller>事实上
<12-2,Mr. Geller>As a matter of fact,

348
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:35,560
<12-2,Mr. Geller>事实上我开始跟朱迪交往时  我根本就没有工作
<12-2,Mr. Geller>when I started dating Judy, I was unemployed.

349
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,060
<12-2,Mr. Geller>她爸问我是干什么工作的
<12-2,Mr. Geller>Her father asked me what I did for a living.

350
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,060
<12-2,Mr. Geller>我说我是律师
<12-2,Mr. Geller>I said I was a lawyer.

351
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,730
<12-3,Chandler>-他们发现事实后你怎么办  -他们一直都没有发现
<12-3,Chandler>- What'd you do when they found out? - They never did.

352
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:46,740
<12-4,Mr. Geller>如果你看到我给他们提供法律意见 点头附和就好
<12-4,Mr. Geller>So if you ever see me giving them legal advice, just nod along.

353
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:49,440
<12-4,Mr. Geller>我们可以进去了吗
<12-4,Mr. Geller>Shall we?

354
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,390
<12-5,Chandler>我猜这里得穿泳装才能进来
<12-5,Chandler>So, I guess we wear swimsuits in here.

355
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:23,090
<13-1,Rachel>乔伊  虽然我不愿意我也得承认
<13-1,Rachel>Well, Joey, I hate to admit it...

356
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:25,420
<13-1,Rachel>你的航海方式  真的有趣多了
<13-1,Rachel>...your way of sailing is a lot more fun.

357
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,480
<13-2,Joey>你为什么不拉一下那条绳子
<13-2,Joey>Why don't you give a pull on that rope?

358
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:33,180
<13-3,Rachel>我们没有要出海
<13-3,Rachel>We're not sailing.

359
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:35,950
<13-4,Joey>-就拉一下  -好吧
