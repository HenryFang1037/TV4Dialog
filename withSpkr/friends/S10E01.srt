<1-8,Ross>我们想去吃点东西  所以如果你们也想...
<1-8,Ross>And then we're gonna grab some food. So if you want--

<1-11,Phoebe>Sounds like he's with someone.

13
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,130
<1-12,Chandler>也可能就他自己
<1-12,Chandler>He could be alone.

14
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:42,990
<1-12,Chandler>今天早上我听见他做俯卧撑
<1-12,Chandler>This morning I heard him do pushups

15
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,530
<1-12,Chandler>后来还跟他的三头肌说话
<1-12,Chandler>and then talk to his triceps.

16
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,870
<1-13,Monica>等等  菲比是对的

00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:04,640
<1-16,Monica>天呐  是查莉
<1-16,Monica>Oh, my God, that's Charlie!

21
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,620
<1-17,Chandler>她背着乔伊和罗斯乱搞
<1-17,Chandler>She's cheating on Joey with Ross!

<1-18,Phoebe>那个尖酸刻薄的大只荡妇
<1-18,Phoebe>Oh, that tart! Floozy! Giant!

00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:20,030
<1-21,Monica>我意思是这不是最好的偷听方法
<1-21,Monica>I'm not sure it's the best way  to hear everything.

27
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:21,030
<1-21,Monica>给我个玻璃杯

00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,810
<2-55,Phoebe>墙这边  只能听不许说话
<2-55,Phoebe>This is the listening side of the wall.

136
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,430
<2-56,Ross>然后她告诉我
<2-56,Ross>Then she told me

137
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,910
<2-56,Ross>她和乔伊已经分手了
<2-56,Ross>that she and Joey had broken up

138
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,460
<2-56,Ross>某程度上是因为她喜欢我
<2-56,Ross>and part of the reason was she had feelings for me.

139
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,000
<2-57,Rachel>是吧  好
<2-57,Rachel>Right. Yeah.

140
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:00,290
<2-58,Ross>你知道我碰到查莉的那天
<2-58,Ross>You know I've wanted to ask Charlie out

141
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:01,430
<2-58,Ross>就想跟她约会
<2-58,Ross>since the day I met her.

142
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,920
<2-59,Rachel>噢  我明白...
<2-59,Rachel>Oh, I know, I know.

143
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,670
<2-59,Rachel>我知道你这些天来很难过
<2-59,Rachel>That's been really hard for you.

144
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:08,170
<2-60,Ross>总之  事情一件接一件
<2-60,Ross>Anyway, one thing led to another, and...

145
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:10,600
<2-60,Ross>还没反应过来  我们已经在接吻了
<2-60,Ross>...before you know it, we were kissing.

146
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:13,200
<2-60,Ross>你觉得乔伊会多生气
<2-60,Ross>How angry do you think Joey's gonna be?

147
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,700
<2-61,Rachel>这很难说  罗斯
<2-61,Rachel>That is hard to say, Ross.

148
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,610
<2-61,Rachel>这很难说
<2-61,Rachel>That is hard to say.

149
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,190
<2-62,Ross>我要去找他了
<2-62,Ross>I gotta find him.

150
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,580
<2-62,Ross>他一定就在这什么地方
<2-62,Ross>He's gotta be here someplace.

151
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,050
<2-63,Rachel>就是啊
<2-63,Rachel>You would think.

152
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,050
<2-64,Rachel>乔伊
<2-64,Rachel>Joey?

153
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,720
<2-65,Joey>-他走了吗  -你怎么做到的
<2-65,Joey>- Is he gone?  - How are you doing this?

154
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,640
<2-67,Joey>怎么  你们
<2-67,Joey>What? Hey!

155
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,960
<2-68,Rachel>你们怎么...  这是怎么回事
<2-68,Rachel>What are you--? What is this?

156
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:40,230
<2-68,Rachel>你们一直在偷听吗
<2-68,Rachel>Have you been listening this entire time?

157
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,370
<2-68,Rachel>对
<2-68,Rachel>Yeah!

158
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,430
<2-69,Phoebe>那  这又是怎么回事
<2-69,Phoebe>Now, what is this?

159
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,980
<2-69,Phoebe>这是怎么回事  这么说吧
<2-69,Phoebe>What is this? Well, let's see.

160
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,080
<2-70,Rachel>我们吻了十分钟
<2-70,Rachel>We kissed for 10 minutes...

161
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:49,790
<2-70,Rachel>然后和朋友说这件事
<2-70,Rachel>...and now we're talking to our friends about it,

162
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,700
<2-70,Rachel>只有六年级学生才这样
<2-70,Rachel>so I guess this is sixth grade.

163
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,520
<2-71,Phoebe>不  你们想过这会使
<2-71,Phoebe>No, no. Have you thought about

164
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,160
<2-71,Phoebe>事情变得多复杂吗
<2-71,Phoebe>how complicated this could get?

165
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:57,330
<2-71,Phoebe>罗斯怎么办
<2-71,Phoebe>What about Ross?

166
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:58,870
<2-72,Joey>可他现在跟查莉在一起
<2-72,Joey>Look, he's with Charlie now.

167
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,390
<2-73,Monica>对  可他想在正式开始之前
<2-73,Monica>Yeah, but he wants to talk to you

168
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,220
<2-73,Monica>先和你说一下
<2-73,Monica>before anything really happens with her.

169
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,140
<2-73,Monica>作为朋友
<2-73,Monica>And as his friend,

170
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:03,960
<2-73,Monica>你们不觉得
<2-73,Monica>I mean, don't you think

171
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,360
<2-73,Monica>你们也应该这么做吗
<2-73,Monica>he deserves the same from you?

172
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:12,320
<2-74,Joey>你太讨厌了  姓盖勒的
<2-74,Joey>You're a pain in my ass, Geller.

<2-75,Rachel>Look, we appreciate all the advice...

175
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,840
<2-75,Rachel>但这是我和乔伊之间的事
<2-75,Rachel>...but this is between Joey and me.

176
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,460
<2-75,Rachel>我们能处理

184

<4-54,Phoebe>偶尔也喜欢
<4-54,Phoebe>We also appreciate gentle spanking

372
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,740
<4-54,Phoebe>被轻柔地打屁股
<4-54,Phoebe>once in a while, just FYl.

373
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:30,510
<4-55,Mike>还有一件事
<4-55,Mike>One more thing.

374
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:34,060
<4-55,Mike>在我的咖啡台上有张宝宝的照片
<4-55,Mike>There might be a picture of Precious on my coffee table.

375
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,790
<4-56,Phoebe>她叫宝宝
<4-56,Phoebe>Her name's Precious?

376
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:37,780
<4-56,Phoebe>她是纯种的吗
<4-56,Phoebe>Is she a pure breed,

377
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,530
<4-56,Phoebe>还是你在动物收容所捡来的
<4-56,Phoebe>or did you pick her up at the pound?

378
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:43,030
<4-57,Mike>总之  我只想提醒你一下
<4-57,Mike>Any way, I just want to give you a heads up.

379
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,330
<4-58,Phoebe>好  如果她不高兴了
<4-58,Phoebe>Okay. And if she gets upset.

380
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,240
<4-58,Phoebe>记得挠挠她的肚子
<4-58,Phoebe>...just scratch her tummy

381
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:47,980
<4-58,Phoebe>逗她高兴
<4-58,Phoebe>and give her a liver snap.

382
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:59,780
<4-59,Precious>嗨  我是宝宝  你是谁
<4-59,Precious>Hi. I'm Precious. Who are you?

383
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,220
<4-60,Phoebe>-我是菲比  -菲比
<4-60,Phoebe>- I'm Phoebe.  - Phoebe?

384
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:05,370
<4-61,Precious>迈克的前女友菲比
<4-61,Precious>Mike's ex-girlfriend, Phoebe?

385
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,500
<4-61,Precious>他的一生挚爱  那个菲比
<4-61,Precious>The love of his life? That Phoebe?

386
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,940
<4-63,Monica>我真想让同事们快点看看这个
<4-63,Monica>Oh, I can't wait for everyone at work to see these!

387
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,070
<4-64,Chandler>明天晚上你才回去工作  是吗
<4-64,Chandler>You go back to work tomorrow night?

388
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:21,590
<4-65,Monica>对
<4-65,Monica>Yeah.

389
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,820
<4-66,Chandler>那么如果你想让他们看
<4-66,Chandler>So if you want people to see them...

390
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:26,770
<4-66,Chandler>也就是说你破晓前不会把他们解下啦
<4-66,Chandler>...you're not having them taken out, say, at the break of dawn?

391
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,580
<4-67,Monica>如果我解下来了
<4-67,Monica>Well, if I had them taken out,

392
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,320
<4-67,Monica>我就不能这么做了
<4-67,Monica>then I wouldn't be able to do this.

393
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,520
<4-67,Monica>你很喜欢  对吧
<4-67,Monica>You like that, right?

394
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:48,430
<4-68,Chandler>你唱什么呢
<4-68,Chandler>What are you singing?

395
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:50,590
<4-69,Monica>《十全十美》里的波利乐舞曲
<4-69,Monica>It's "Bolero" from 10.

396
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,440
<4-70,Chandler>那是《现代启示录》里的《狂热的瓦格纳》
<4-70,Chandler>It's "Ride of the Valkyries" from Apocalypse Now.

397
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,390
<4-70,Chandler>是这样  梳辫子是
<4-70,Chandler>Here's the thing. The cornrows were

398
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,680
<4-70,Chandler>用来解决你头发的卷曲问题的
<4-70,Chandler>a solution to your frizzy-hair problem.

399
00:20:58,730 --> 00:20:59,610
<4-70,Chandler>现在到家了
<4-70,Chandler>Now that we're home,

400
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:01,020
<4-70,Chandler>没有那样的困扰了
<4-70,Chandler>you don't have that problem.

401
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,300
<4-70,Chandler>所以如果你考虑一下...
<4-70,Chandler>If you think about it...

402
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,580
<4-70,Chandler>我讨厌他们
<4-70,Chandler>I hate them.

403
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:07,410
<4-71,Monica>什么  你说过你喜欢的
<4-71,Monica>What? You said you liked them.

404
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:09,400
<4-72,Chandler>我说过吗  我们回想一下
<4-72,Chandler>Did l? Let's refresh.

405
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:10,620
<4-72,Chandler>我想我的原话是
<4-72,Chandler>I believe what I said was

406
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,450
<4-72,Chandler>"我可以看见你的头皮"
<4-72,Chandler>that I could see your scalp.

407
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:15,720
<4-73,Monica>好吧  虽然你不喜欢
<4-73,Monica>Well, fine. So you don't like them.

408
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,940
<4-73,Monica>可其他人都喜欢
<4-73,Monica>Everybody else does.

409
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:19,740
<4-74,Chandler>再一次  让我们回到那次旅游
<4-74,Chandler>Again, let's journey back.

410
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:22,250
<4-74,Chandler>我记得瑞秋说的是
<4-74,Chandler>As I recall, Rachel said

411
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:25,030
<4-74,Chandler>她以前从没注意过你的头骨的形状
<4-74,Chandler>she had never noticed the shape of your skull before.

412
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,930
<4-74,Chandler>还有乔伊...
<4-74,Chandler>And Joey?

413
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:29,780
<4-74,Chandler>乔伊当时看不出你有什么不一样
<4-74,Chandler>Well, Joey didn't realize there was anything different.

414
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:32,300
<4-75,Monica>我不管  我喜欢这样
<4-75,Monica>You know what? I don't care.

415
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,300
<4-75,Monica>喜欢它  而且我要留着它
<4-75,Monica>I like it like this, and I'm gonna keep it.

416
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:35,130
<4-75,Monica>你嫉妒是
<4-75,Monica>You're just jealous

417
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:37,270
<4-75,Monica>因为你的头发不能这么做
<4-75,Monica>because your hair can't do this.

418
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:43,680
<4-76,Chandler>-敲在你的牙上了  -还有眼睛
<4-76,Chandler>- Get yourself in the tooth? - And the eye.

419
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:56,200
<4-78,Ross>她来了  艾玛
<4-78,Ross>Hi! There she is! Hi, Emma.

420
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,990
<4-78,Ross>天呐  我想死你了
<4-78,Ross>Oh, my God, I missed you.

<4-78,Ross>艾玛  我真是太想你了
<4-78,Ross>Oh, Emma, I missed you so much. Hi.

<4-78,Ross>你和外婆过得开心吗  呃
<4-78,Ross>Did you have a good time with Grandma Green? Huh?

423
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:07,470
<4-78,Ross>她喋喋不休的时候
<4-78,Ross>Did she give you a bottle of antidepressants again

424
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:09,500
<4-78,Ross>给你抗抑郁药了吗
<4-78,Ross>to use as a rattle?

425
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,010
<4-79,Rachel>只有一次  罗斯
<4-79,Rachel>That was one time, Ross,

426
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:14,690
<4-79,Rachel>而且只有5毫克
<4-79,Rachel>and they were only, like, five milligrams.

427

<4-86,Ross>大瓶的洗发液破了
<4-86,Ross>Oh, major shampoo explosion!

<4-88,Ross>还沾得到处都是
<4-88,Ross>Oh, it's all over everything!

438

<4-88,Ross>Why? Why me?

439
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:56,060
<4-89,Rachel>因为你拿了300瓶洗发液

00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,040
<4-92,Ross>这个更难清理
<4-92,Ross>It's even harder to clean!

445
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,590
<4-92,Ross>为什么
<4-92,Ross>Why?

446
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:17,370
<4-92,Ross>为什么坏事总是落到好人的头上

00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:22,560
<4-93,Rachel>好吧  很显然我来得不是时候

<4-95,Phoebe>好了  迈克已经回来了
<4-95,Phoebe>All right, so Mike's on his way over.

451
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,790
<4-95,Phoebe>你以为你们在这儿见
<4-95,Phoebe>You thought you were meeting here,

452
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,270
<4-95,Phoebe>他却以为在餐馆见面
<4-95,Phoebe>he thought at the restaurant, so....

453
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,440
<4-95,Phoebe>谁对谁错不重要
<4-95,Phoebe>It doesn't matter who's right or wrong.

454
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:41,900
<4-95,Phoebe>重要的是我要走了
<4-95,Phoebe>The point is, I'm gonna take off.

455
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,680
<4-96,Precious>你告诉我到底发生了什么之前
<4-96,Precious>Wait. I'm not letting you leave

456
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:46,310
<4-96,Precious>我不会让你走的
<4-96,Precious>until you tell me what's going on here.

457
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:46,840
<4-96,Precious>我是说
<4-96,Precious>I mean...

458
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:49,360
<4-96,Precious>你们和好了还是怎么的
<4-96,Precious>...are you guys getting back together or something?

459

<4-97,Phoebe>苏茜  我能叫你苏茜吗
<4-97,Phoebe>Susie-- Can I call you Susie?

461
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,590
<4-98,Precious>我叫宝宝
<4-98,Precious>My name is Precious.

462
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,070
<4-99,Phoebe>我可叫不出口
<4-99,Phoebe>I can't say that.

463
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,070
<4-99,Phoebe>苏茜  跟你直说了吧
<4-99,Phoebe>Susie, I'm gonna be straight with you.

464
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:10,340
<4-99,Phoebe>迈克跟我确实和好了
<4-99,Phoebe>Mike and I are back together.

465
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,780
<4-99,Phoebe>并且不幸的是
<4-99,Phoebe>And unfortunately...

466
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:15,490
<4-99,Phoebe>这样就要终结你们的关系
<4-99,Phoebe>...that effectively ends your relationship with him.

467
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,640
<4-99,Phoebe>并且他对此感到很抱歉
<4-99,Phoebe>He's very sorry about that,

468
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:21,740
<4-99,Phoebe>并祝你好运
<4-99,Phoebe>and wishes you the best luck in all your endeavors.

469
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:26,890
<4-100,Precious>我无法相信  为什么
<4-100,Precious>I just can't believe this. Why?

470
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,660
<4-101,Phoebe>这个我也不知...
<4-101,Phoebe>Well, I don't--

471
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:29,560
<4-102,Precious>他为什么这么做
<4-102,Precious>Why would he do this?

472
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:30,790
<4-102,Precious>我做错什么了
<4-102,Precious>What's wrong with me?

473
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:32,370
<4-103,Phoebe>没有  你什么也没做错
<4-103,Phoebe>There's nothing wrong with you.

474
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,660
<4-104,Precious>那我现在到底该怎么办
<4-104,Precious>What the hell am I supposed to do now?

475
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:37,300
<4-105,Phoebe>可恶  女人  振作起来
<4-105,Phoebe>Damn it, woman! Pull yourself together!

476
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:41,110
<4-105,Phoebe>看在上帝的份上  保持你的尊严
<4-105,Phoebe>Have some pride, for the love of God!

477
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:47,610
<4-106,Phoebe>好吧  你好象不喜欢苦涩的爱情
<4-106,Phoebe>Okay, not a fan of the tough love.

478
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,040
<4-106,Phoebe>我真不敢相信
<4-106,Phoebe>I just can't believe

479
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:52,630
<4-107,Precious>迈克竟然没有给我一点暗示
<4-107,Precious>that Mike didn't give me any warning.

480
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,540
<4-108,Phoebe>他之前也不知道
<4-108,Phoebe>He didn't know.

481
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:56,990
<4-108,Phoebe>他也不是计划来巴巴多斯
<4-108,Phoebe>He wasn't planning on coming to Barbados

482
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:58,080
<4-108,Phoebe>向我求婚的
<4-108,Phoebe>and proposing to me.

483
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,520
<4-109,Precious>他向你求婚了
<4-109,Precious>He proposed to you?

484
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:03,360
<4-109,Precious>这真是史上最糟糕的生日了
<4-109,Precious>This is the worst birthday ever!

485
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:09,930
<4-109,Precious>听着  宝宝...
<4-109,Precious>Look, Precious...

486
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:14,770
<4-110,Phoebe>你不值得为迈克伤心
<4-110,Phoebe>Mike's not worth this.

487
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:16,770
<4-110,Phoebe>你是个迷人聪明的女孩
<4-110,Phoebe>You're an attractive intelligent woman...

488
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:19,320
<4-110,Phoebe>面对现实吧  迈克太不是东西了
<4-110,Phoebe>...and let's face it, Mike's kind of a wang.

489
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:23,340
<4-110,Phoebe>他向我求婚的同时还跟你在一起
<4-110,Phoebe>He proposed to me while he was still seeing you.

490
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:26,370
<4-110,Phoebe>他居然想在你生日的时候跟你分手
<4-110,Phoebe>He was gonna break up with you on your birthday?

491
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:28,370
<4-110,Phoebe>我本来也不想炫耀
<4-110,Phoebe>I don't like to kiss and tell,

492
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:31,290
<4-110,Phoebe>不过这个周末他对你不忠的太多了
<4-110,Phoebe>but he cheated on you a lot this weekend.

493
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,570
<4-111,Precious>天呐  可能你说对了
<4-111,Precious>Oh, my God, you know, maybe you're right.

494
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:34,970
<4-111,Precious>可能我并不需要他
<4-111,Precious>Maybe I don't need him.

495
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:37,590
<4-111,Precious>我应该受到尊重
<4-111,Precious>I deserve to be treated with respect.

496
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,140
<4-112,Precious>去你的  迈克
<4-112,Precious>Screw you, Mike.

497
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:42,020
<4-112,Precious>你这个胆怯的杂种
<4-112,Precious>You're a coward and a bastard,

498
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:43,850
<4-112,Precious>我希望你烂死在地狱里
<4-112,Precious>and I hope you rot in hell!

499
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,970
<4-113,Phoebe>不用谢我
<4-113,Phoebe>You're welcome.

500
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:58,650
<5-1,Chandler>亲爱的  你在里面好久了
<5-1,Chandler>Honey? You've been in there for a long time.

501
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:00,630
<5-1,Chandler>没事吧
<5-1,Chandler>Is everything okay?

502
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:02,870
<5-2,Monica>不
<5-2,Monica>Not really.

503
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:06,660
<5-3,Monica>我有点问题
<5-3,Monica>I have a problem.

504
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:10,730
<5-4,Chandler>是吗  怎么了
<5-4,Chandler>Really? What happened?

505
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:15,850
<5-5,Monica>好吧  我唱着《女人不哭》跳舞...
<5-5,Monica>Well, I was dancing around and singing "No Woman, No Cry" ...

506
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:19,800
<5-5,Monica>然后就挂住了
<5-5,Monica>...and I got stuck.

507
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,660
<5-6,Chandler>一点都动不了了
<5-6,Chandler>You can't move at all?

508
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:24,220
<5-7,Monica>噢  我可以动...
<5-7,Monica>Oh, I can move.

509
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,200
<5-8,Chandler>如果我解开你
<5-8,Chandler>If I untangle you,

510
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:33,840
<5-8,Chandler>你会解开这个稻穗头
<5-8,Chandler>will you please get rid of the cornrows?

511
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:35,280
<5-9,Monica>好吧
<5-9,Monica>I guess so.

512
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:39,440
<5-10,Chandler>有些看起来有磨痕了
<5-10,Chandler>Some of these look a little frayed.

513
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:41,860
<5-11,Monica>对  我本来想咬开的
<5-11,Monica>Yeah, I tried to gnaw myself free.

514
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:47,520
<5-13,Rachel>-嗨  -嗨
<5-13,Rachel>- Hey. - Hi.

515
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:51,390
<5-14,Joey>-怎么样  你跟罗斯说了吗  -没有  我想说
<5-14,Joey>- So? Did you tell Ross?  - Well, I tried...

516
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,210
<5-15,Rachel>但他的洗发液出事故了
<5-15,Rachel>...but then he had a shampoo-related emergency.

517
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:58,170
<5-15,Rachel>-所以我想该轮到你去了  -不...
<5-15,Rachel>- So I guess now it's your turn again.  - No...

518
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,940
<5-16,Joey>最好是你去告诉他
<5-16,Joey>I think it's better if you tell him.

519
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:01,760
<5-16,Joey>女人来说容易些
<5-16,Joey>You know, it's easier for a woman.

520
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:04,780
<5-16,Joey>你知道  如果他抓狂了  你就可以
<5-16,Joey>That way, you know, if he gets mad, all you have to do is go

521
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:06,920
<5-16,Joey>我不是有意的
<5-16,Joey>I didn't mean it.

522
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,980
<5-16,Joey>我太抱歉了

<5-18,Joey>好吧...这样怎么样  明天...
<5-18,Joey>Alright, alright, okay, uhm... How about this? Tomorrow...

525
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,200
<5-18,Joey>明天我们一起去
<5-18,Joey>Tomorrow we'll both go

526
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,260
<5-18,Joey>一起告诉他
<5-18,Joey>and we'll tell him together.

527
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:27,660
<5-19,Rachel>好吧  听起来公平些
<5-19,Rachel>Okay, that sounds fair.

528
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:29,550
<5-19,Rachel>可这样我们又不能...
<5-19,Rachel>That just means, once again, we can't--

00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:30,470
<5-19,Rachel>我知道...
<5-19,Rachel>I know...

530

531
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,420
<5-20,Joey>我们有自制力
<5-20,Joey>I mean, we can control ourselves.

532
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,720
<5-20,Joey>我们不是动物啊
<5-20,Joey>We're not animals.

533

<5-21,Rachel>-当然  我们可以等  -是啊
<5-21,Rachel>- No! Of course, we can wait.  - Yeah.

534
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:42,070
<5-21,Rachel>那么我想该说晚安了
<5-21,Rachel>All right, so I guess that means good night then.
