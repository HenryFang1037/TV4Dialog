64
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:12,200
<2-22,Rachel>因为金会发飙  她本来就不太喜欢我

<2-25,Ross>Maybe it's a universal thing.

68
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:21,220
<2-26,Joey>或许因为现在是上班时间

<11-10,Kim>给我听着
<11-10,Kim>Listen to me...

246
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:08,350
<11-10,Kim>要是你以为跟拉夫上床  就能坐上我的位子
<11-10,Kim>If you think sleeping with Ralph is going to get you my job.

247
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:10,150
<11-10,Kim>你就错了
<11-10,Kim>You are sadly mistaken.

248
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:12,500
<11-11,Rachel>我不想坐你的位子  真的
<11-11,Rachel>l don't want your job. l don't.

249
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:15,140
<11-11,Rachel>这真是天大的误会  我没跟他亲热
<11-11,Rachel>This is such a mistake. l didn't make out with him.

250
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:17,180
<11-11,Rachel>没人跟他亲热
<11-11,Rachel>Nobody made out with him.

251
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,250
<11-11,Rachel>我昨天没用我的卡
<11-11,Rachel>l didn't use my keycard yesterday.

<11-11,Rachel>我都不知道怎么用
<11-11,Rachel>l don't even know how to use my keycard.

<11-13,Kim>Yeah. Nothing happened.

255
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:49,520
<11-13,Kim>刚才的性张力都要一触即发了
<11-13,Kim>You could cut the sexual tension in here with a knife.

256
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:58,900
<12-1,Hillary>之后我也只能去当厨师
<12-1,Hillary>And after that, what could l do except become a chef?

257
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:03,370
<12-3,Hillary>我希望将来能自己开家餐厅
<12-3,Hillary>And someday soon, I hope to open my own restaurant.

<12-5,Hillary>You know, you're a really great listener.

259
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:11,670
<12-5,Hillary>我交往过的男人多半讲个不停
<12-5,Hillary>Most guys l go out with, they talk and talk.

260
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:17,230
<12-7,Hillary>听到后来  真想叫他们闭嘴
<12-7,Hillary>After a while it's like, shut your mouth, you know?

261
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:21,820
<12-8,Ross>我可能说太多了
<12-8,Ross>I've probably been talking too much.

<13-8,Chandler>你还挂穿得一朵花的宝宝照片
<13-8,Chandler>You've got a picture of a baby dressed like flowers!

283
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,390
<13-8,Chandler>这不是乔伊

<13-9,Joey>那是一个名摄影师画的
<13-9,Joey>And that happens to be a picture by a famous artist

<13-11,Joey>你怎么这么说  好过分哦
<13-11,Joey>Why would you say that? That's just mean.

291
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,950
<13-12,Chandler>我惹你生气了  我说了什么
<13-12,Chandler>Now l've upset you? What did l say?

292
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,250
<13-13,Joey>不是你说了什么  而是你的口气
<13-13,Joey>lt's not what you said. lt's the way you said it.

293
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,420
<13-13,Joey>我的天

295
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,240
<14-1,Rachel>现在她觉得是我跟他亲热
<14-1,Rachel>So now, she thinks that I made out with him

296
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,360
<14-1,Rachel>是为了夺她的位
<14-1,Rachel>and I did it to get her job.

297
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,990
<14-2,Phoebe>-你怎么不跟她说实话  -我说了
<14-2,Phoebe>- Why didn't you just tell the truth? - l did.

298
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:19,960
<14-3,Rachel>但是她觉得不会有人蠢到
<14-3,Rachel>But she doesn't think anyone would be stupid enough

299
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:23,250
<14-3,Rachel>把影印小弟当成拉夫·劳伦
<14-3,Rachel>to confuse Kenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren.

300
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:28,100
<14-4,Phoebe>如果肯尼才是公司的幕后老板呢
<14-4,Phoebe>What if Kenny were the real brains behind the whole company?

301
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,920
<14-4,Phoebe>搞不好拉夫·劳伦
<14-4,Phoebe>You know? What if Kenny hired that Ralph guy

302
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,360
<14-4,Phoebe>只是肯尼请来当幕前的人
<14-4,Phoebe>to be the pretty front man, huh?

303
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,990
<14-4,Phoebe>她想过这个问题吗
<14-4,Phoebe>Did she ever think of that?

304
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,200
<14-5,Rachel>你今天跟肯尼约会了吧
<14-5,Rachel>You were with Kenny today, weren't you?

305
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,190
<14-6,Phoebe>只有一下下而已
<14-6,Phoebe>Just for a second.

306
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,270
<14-7,Rachel>菲比  我该怎么办
<14-7,Rachel>Phoebe, what am l gonna do?

307
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:48,870
<14-8,Phoebe>你只好跟拉夫·劳伦上床了
<14-8,Phoebe>The only thing you can do. Sleep with Ralph Lauren.

308
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,470
<14-8,Phoebe>我才不跟拉夫·劳伦上床
<14-8,Phoebe>l'm not gonna sleep with Ralph Lauren.

309
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,750
<14-9,Rachel>我可以  但是我不会
<14-9,Rachel>l mean, l could, but l wouldn't.

310
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,110
<14-10,Phoebe>那跟肯尼上床吧
<14-10,Phoebe>Sleep with Kenny.

311
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:05,120
<14-10,Phoebe>-那样对我也没好处  -好处可大了
<14-10,Phoebe>- That wouldn't help me. - Oh, yes, it would.

312
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,420
<15-1,Hillary>今晚我真的很开心
<15-1,Hillary>l've had a really good time tonight.

313
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:14,210
<15-3,Hillary>我很少第一次约会  就感到如此心有灵犀
<15-3,Hillary>You know, l rarely connect with someone this much on the first date.

314
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:18,000
<15-4,Ross>我也是
<15-4,Ross>Me neither.

<15-6,Ross>我只是喜欢闻那味道
<15-6,Ross>l just like the smell.

318
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:34,680
<15-7,Hillary>你好好笑
<15-7,Hillary>You make me laugh.

319
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,380
<15-9,Hillary>要不要去沙发上坐一下
<15-9,Hillary>Would you like to move to the couch?

320
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,830
<15-10,Ross>或许我该把灯光调暗一点
<15-10,Ross>Maybe l'll just turn down the lights a little?

321
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:50,690
<15-12,Ross>干脆关灯如何
<15-12,Ross>How about all the way?

322

<16-3,Rachel>l'm sorry that l lied to you before.

340
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:01,130
<16-3,Rachel>你猜得没错
<16-3,Rachel>You were right.

341
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:04,750
<16-3,Rachel>拉夫和我交往过  但已经结束了
<16-3,Rachel>Ralph and l were an item, but we're not anymore.

344
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:13,240
<16-5,Rachel>他说"瑞秋  我不能这样"
<16-5,Rachel>He said, "Rachel, l can't do this.

345
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,580
<16-5,Rachel>"虽然你是个很美
<16-5,Rachel>Even though you're a very, very...

348
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:26,460
<16-5,Rachel>不知为何他还说  "你永远也不会升职"
<16-5,Rachel>But he said, "And you will never get promoted...

349
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:30,640
<16-5,Rachel>尤其不可能高于金  她是拉夫·劳伦体系
<16-5,Rachel>...especially not above Kim, who is an integral cog...

350
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,670
<16-5,Rachel>最不可或缺的重要人物"
<16-5,Rachel>...in the Ralph Lauren machine."

<16-7,Kim>Oh, my God.

354
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:04,540
<16-7,Kim>他看你的眼神好冷酷
<16-7,Kim>He gave you the coldest look l've ever seen.

355
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,550
<16-7,Kim>仿佛对你恨之入骨
<16-7,Kim>lt's like he hates you!

356
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:08,400
