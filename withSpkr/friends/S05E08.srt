<1-1,Rachel>莫妮卡  这真是史上最棒的感恩节大餐
<1-1,Rachel>Oh Monica that was the best Thanksgiving dinner ever!

2
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,860
<1-1,Rachel>太好吃了  你把我们撑死了
<1-1,Rachel>They're so good. I think you killed us.

3
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,140
<1-2,Ross>我连一口都吃不下了
<1-2,Ross>I couldn't possibly eat another bite.

4
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:19,960
<1-3,Joey>我要吃点甜的
<1-3,Joey>I need something sweet.

5

<1-4,Phoebe>-有人想看电视吗  -好的
<1-4,Phoebe>- Does anyone wanna watch TV? - Yeah, sure.

00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,230
<1-5,All>莫妮卡  你的遥控器坏了
<1-5,All>Monica your remote doesn't work.

7
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,270
<1-7,Monica>菲比  你得把它拿起来对准
<1-7,Monica>Phoebe, you have to lift it and point.

8
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:36,370
<1-8,Phoebe>这样啊  算了
<1-8,Phoebe>Oh. Aw, forget it.

9
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:39,800
<1-9,Rachel>你们知道我们应该玩什么吗
<1-9,Rachel>Yeah, you know what we should all do?

10
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:40,800
<1-9,Rachel>我们应该来玩
<1-9,Rachel>We should play that game

11
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:43,200
<1-9,Rachel>感恩告白游戏
<1-9,Rachel>where everyone says one thing that they're thankful for.

12
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:47,860
<1-10,Joey>我来  我要感谢今年的秋天这么美
<1-10,Joey>Ooh-ooh, I! I am thankful for this beautiful fall we've been having.

13
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:49,300
<1-12,Chandler>说得真好  乔伊
<1-12,Chandler>That's sweet, Joey.

14
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,560
<1-13,Joey>那天我在等公车
<1-13,Joey>Yeah, the other day I was at the bus-stop

15
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:55,070
<1-13,Joey>突然吹来一阵秋风
<1-13,Joey>and this lovely fall breeze came in out of nowhere

16
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,050
<1-13,Joey>把一个女生的裙子吹了起来
<1-13,Joey>and blew this chick's skirt right up.

17
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:02,150
<1-13,Joey>对了  我还要感谢丁字裤
<1-13,Joey>Oh! Which reminds me, I'm also thankful for thongs.

33
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:55,200
<2-1,Joey>与其说它是内裤
<2-1,Joey>I mean, it's not so much an underpant

34
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,330
<2-1,Joey>不如说是一种伟大工程
<2-1,Joey>as it is a feat of engineering.

35
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,040
<2-1,Joey>真是太不可思议了
<2-1,Joey>I mean, it's amazing

36
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,700
<2-1,Joey>料子那么少效果却那么大
<2-1,Joey>how much they can do with so little material!

37
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,030
<2-1,Joey>还会戏弄你  会让你想
<2-1,Joey>And the way they play with your mind!

38
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:07,430
<2-1,Joey>"有穿吗"  "没穿吗"
<2-1,Joey>Is it there? Is it not there?

39
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,400
<2-2,Chandler>你知道你还在胡言乱语吗
<2-2,Chandler>Are you aware that you're still talking?

40
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:15,280
<2-3,Monica>有没有人要感谢丁字裤以外的东西
<2-3,Monica>Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?

41
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,150
<2-4,Ross>我不知道要感谢什么好
<2-4,Ross>Huh, I don't know what to pick.

42
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,530
<2-4,Ross>是离婚呢  还是感谢被赶出来
<2-4,Ross>Am I more thankful for my divorce or my eviction?

43
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:23,570
<2-5,Phoebe>哇  我还以为你会没得谢呢
<2-5,Phoebe>Wow! See, and I didn't think you'd be able to come up with anything.

44
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,990
<2-6,Ross>抱歉  这是最惨的一次感恩节
<2-6,Ross>I'm sorry. It's just that this is the worse Thanksgiving ever.

45
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,850
<2-7,Chandler>不  我才是悲惨感恩节盟主
<2-7,Chandler>No-no-no!  am the king of bad Thanksgivings.

46
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,770
<2-7,Chandler>你不能挟失败的婚姻空降
<2-7,Chandler>You can't just swoop in here with your bad marriage

47
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,030
<2-7,Chandler>抢了我的宝座
<2-7,Chandler>and take that away from me.

48
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:37,830
<2-8,Rachel>你不会又想细说一遍
<2-8,Rachel>Oh, you're not gonna tell the whole story

49
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,510
<2-8,Rachel>你爸妈离婚的事吧
<2-8,Rachel>about how your parents got divorced again are you?

50
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,640
<2-10,Joey>-不要讲了  -别这样嘛  我想听
<2-10,Joey>- Oh God, no. - Oh, come on! I wanna hear it!

51
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,890
<2-10,Joey>没有钱德勒扫兴就不算感恩节了
<2-10,Joey>It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler bumming us out!

52
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,800
<2-11,Chandler>这跟游行一样  是一项传统
<2-11,Chandler>It's a tradition, like the parade.

53
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:54,880
<2-11,Chandler>如果游行也出柜离家
<2-11,Chandler>If the parade decided it was gay, moved out,

54
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,630
<2-11,Chandler>抛妻弃子的话
<2-11,Chandler>and abandoned its entire family.

56
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:01,880
<3-1,Mrs. Bing>钱德勒  亲爱的
<3-1,Mrs. Bing>Now Chandler dear,

57
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:04,280
<3-1,Mrs. Bing>爸爸和我要离婚
<3-1,Mrs. Bing>just because your father and I are getting a divorce

58
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:06,420
<3-1,Mrs. Bing>并不代表我们不爱你
<3-1,Mrs. Bing>it doesn't mean we don't love you.

59
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,190
<3-1,Mrs. Bing>只是代表  他上床的对像是男仆不是我
<3-1,Mrs. Bing>It just means he would rather sleep with the house-boy than me.

60
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:17,130
<3-2,The Housekeeper>小少爷还要火鸡吗
<3-2,The Housekeeper>More turkey Mr. Chandler?

61
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,690
<3-2,The Housekeeper>你说得对  你的更惨
<3-2,The Housekeeper>You're right. Yours is worse.

62
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:25,300
<3-2,The Housekeeper>你是悲惨感恩节盟主
<3-2,The Housekeeper>You are the king of bad Thanksgivings.

63
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:27,720
<4-1,Ross>不一定  我有一次更惨
<4-1,Ross>I don't know about that. I've got one that's worse.

64
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:30,490
<4-2,Phoebe>是吗  会惨过"小少爷还要火鸡"吗
<4-2,Phoebe>Really? Worse than, "More turkey Mr. Chandler?"

65
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,830
<4-3,Chandler>小少爷跟仆人有仇吗
<4-3,Chandler>Oh, did the little rich boy have a problem with the butler?

66
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,250
<4-4,Phoebe>是的  我的更惨
<4-4,Phoebe>Yes, mine's worse!

68
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:46,790
<4-4,Phoebe>还要绷带  还要绷带
<4-4,Phoebe>More bandages! More bandages!

<4-4,Phoebe>能不能再给我拿一些绷带进来
<4-4,Phoebe>Please, can I get some more bandages in here!

70
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,160
<5-1,Past Life Phoebe>这个人快死了
<5-1,Past Life Phoebe>This man is dying!

71
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,740
<5-1,Past Life Phoebe>不是吧

73
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:07,300
<6-1,Ross>今生是吧  好的  那钱德勒的比较惨
<6-1,Ross>Oh, this life! Oh okay no, Chandler's is worse.

74
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:11,590
<6-2,Phoebe>记得前世的事一定很酷
<6-2,Phoebe>Man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like that!

75
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,600
<6-3,Joey>我都没有前世的记忆
<6-3,Joey>I don't have any past life memories.

76

<8-2,Joey>白痴的不只是我
<8-2,Joey>Hey, I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot. All right?

119
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:54,090
<8-2,Joey>罗斯有一次想说冬南瓜
<8-2,Joey>Remember when Ross tried to say, "Butternut squash?"

120
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:57,350
<8-2,Joey>结果讲成了南冬瓜
<8-2,Joey>And it came out, "Squatternut buash?"

121
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:01,730
<8-3,Ross>的确一样白痴
<8-3,Ross>Yeah that's the same.

122
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,010
<8-4,Monica>是的  那就是我最惨的感恩节
<8-4,Monica>That's it. That's my worse Thanksgiving.

123
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:09,080
<8-5,Phoebe>等等  瑞秋说的不可能是那次
<8-5,Phoebe>Oh wait! That can't be the one Rachel's talking about.

124
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:10,770
<8-5,Phoebe>她根本不知道那件事
<8-5,Phoebe>She didn't even know that happened.

125
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,750
<8-6,All>你说的到底是哪一次
<8-6,All>So which one was it? Which one?

126
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,500
<8-7,Monica>我真的不想提这件事
<8-7,Monica>Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story.

127
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:18,520
<8-8,Chandler>讲嘛  莫妮卡  重温悲惨的回忆
<8-8,Chandler>Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain

128
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:20,760
<8-8,Chandler>变得郁闷  是感恩节的精神所在
<8-8,Chandler>and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about.

129
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:25,610
<8-8,Chandler>至少我觉得是  当然了还有印第安原住民
<8-8,Chandler>Y'know, for me anyway. And of course, the Indians.

130
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:28,920
<8-9,Monica>听着  在座所有人
<8-9,Monica>Look umm, of all people,

131
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,610
<8-9,Monica>最不希望我提的绝对是你
<8-9,Monica>you do not want me to tell this story!

132
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,680
<8-9,Monica>什么意思
<8-9,Monica>What is that supposed to mean?

133
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:35,310
<9-1,Mrs. Geller>莫妮卡  应该是瑞秋来了
<9-1,Mrs. Geller>Monica! I think Rachel's here!

135
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,880
<9-2,Monica>我来开

<12-27,Rachel>他的口水流了满地
<12-27,Rachel>He was just drooling all over you.

269
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,550
<12-27,Rachel>感觉一定很过瘾
<12-27,Rachel>That must've felt so great!

270
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,480
<12-28,Monica>一点也不过瘾

273
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:09,110
<12-30,Monica>但我还是觉得没报到仇
<12-30,Monica>Y'know I still don't feel like I got him back, y'know?

274
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,010
<12-30,Monica>我想狠狠的羞辱他
<12-30,Monica>I just want to humiliate him.

275
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:13,280
<12-30,Monica>我想让他光着身体
<12-30,Monica>I wanna, I want him to be like naked

276
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:15,440
<12-30,Monica>再指着他大笑
<12-30,Monica>and then I'm going to point at him and laugh!

277
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:20,330
<12-31,Rachel>好  说不定可以做到
<12-31,Rachel>Okay,  we may be able to do.

278
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:22,690
<12-32,Monica>怎么做
<12-32,Monica>How?

279
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:26,530
<12-33,Rachel>男人要做爱之前都会脱光衣服
<12-33,Rachel>Well guys tend to get naked before they're gonna have sex.

280
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,090
<12-33,Rachel>什么
<12-33,Rachel>What?!

281
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:30,810
<12-34,Monica>我这么努力瘦这么多
<12-34,Monica>I mean, I didn't work this hard and-and-and lose all this weight

282
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:33,250
<12-34,Monica>可不是为了把"花"给他那种人
<12-34,Monica>so that I can give my flower to someone like him!

283
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,720
<12-35,Rachel>第一  你再那样讲
<12-35,Rachel>Okay, first of all, if you keep calling it that,

284
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,060
<12-35,Rachel>保证没有人会要
<12-35,Rachel>no one's gonna ever take it.

285
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:42,470
<12-35,Rachel>第二  又不是要你来真的
<12-35,Rachel>Then, second of all you're not actually gonna have sex with him!

286
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,800
<12-35,Rachel>只是要你误导他
<12-35,Rachel>You're just gonna make him think that you are.

287
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,360
<12-38,Monica>等他脱光了  我就把他赶出去
<12-38,Monica>And when he's naked I can throw him out in the front yard

288
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:53,860
<12-38,Monica>锁上门  让所有的邻居耻笑他
<12-38,Monica>and lock the door and all the neighbors will just humiliate him!

289
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:56,550
<12-39,Rachel>那你就绝对报了仇
<12-39,Rachel>Then, you will definitely get him back!

290
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,790
<12-40,Monica>我要怎么误导他呢
<12-40,Monica>Okay, so how do I make him think I wanna have sex with him?

291
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,260
<12-41,Rachel>你这样做
<12-41,Rachel>Okay, oh, here's what you do.

292
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,350
<12-41,Rachel>假装什么都能让你兴奋
<12-41,Rachel>Just act like everything around you turns you on.

293
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:09,080
<12-42,Monica>什么意思
<12-42,Monica>What do you mean?

294
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:11,040
<12-43,Rachel>就是什么都很挑逗
<12-43,Rachel>Well, like anything can be sexy.

295

298
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,740
<12-43,Rachel>或是把它放在腿边
<12-43,Rachel>Or I can bring it down to my side

299
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:31,780
<12-43,Rachel>边从手指中滑过  边跟他说话
<12-43,Rachel>and bring it through my fingers while I talk to him.

341
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,740
<14-1,Chandler>这就是我断趾的原因吗  因为我说你肥
<14-1,Chandler>That's why I lost my toe?! Because I called you fat?!
