<1-5,Ben>-谢谢爸爸  -只有一个爸爸  两个妈妈
<1-5,Ben>- Thanks, Daddy. - No, no. One daddy, two mommies.

<1-6,Ross>- All right, it's all yours. - Okay, okay.

5
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,500
<1-8,Ross>好样的  好样的
<1-8,Ross>There you go, there you go.

6
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:26,690
<1-9,Phoebe>本的第一辆两轮自行车  太激动人心了
<1-9,Phoebe>Wow, Ben's first big-kid's bike. This is so exciting!

7
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,840
<1-10,Monica>我还记得我学骑车的时候
<1-10,Monica>Oh, yeah, I remember mine.

8
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,570
<1-10,Monica>我6岁的生日  我爸爸带我去公园
<1-10,Monica>It was my sixth birthday. My dad took me to the park...

9
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:35,240
<1-10,Monica>-坐上脚踏车  它就垮了  -没错
<1-10,Monica>- ...and I got on it, and it bent. - Yeah.

10
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,910
<1-12,Phoebe>-我从来没有属于自己的脚踏车  -什么
<1-12,Phoebe>- I never had a bike of my own. - What?

11
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,920
<1-13,Ross>我们家很穷
<1-13,Ross>We didn't have a lot of money.

12
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,850
<1-14,Phoebe>但对街的女孩有一辆最酷的脚踏车
<1-14,Phoebe>But the girl across the street had the best bike.

13
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:45,480
<1-14,Phoebe>它是粉红色的
<1-14,Phoebe>It was pink, and it had

14
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,490
<1-14,Phoebe>手挂着五颜六色的流苏
<1-14,Phoebe>rainbow-colored tassels hanging off the handles...

15
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,730
<1-14,Phoebe>还有铃档  一个白色的车筐
<1-14,Phoebe>...and a bell and this big, white wicker basket...

16
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,960
<1-14,Phoebe>上面还有塑料小雏菊
<1-14,Phoebe>...with those plastic daisies stuck on.

17
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,770
<1-15,Chandler>听起来很像是我的第一辆脚踏车
<1-15,Chandler>That sounds like my first bike.

18
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,000
<1-15,Chandler>我爸把他旧的脚踏车送给我
<1-15,Chandler>My dad gave me his old one.

19
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:04,340
<1-17,Monica>-那姑娘让你骑她的车吗  -不
<1-17,Monica>- Did the girl ever let you ride it? - No.

20
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,940
<1-18,Phoebe>但她把装脚踏车的纸箱送给我
<1-18,Phoebe>But she gave me the box that it came in.

21
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:10,540
<1-18,Phoebe>纸箱前面印了脚踏车的照片
<1-18,Phoebe>It had a picture of the bike on the front.

22
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,770
<1-18,Phoebe>我可以坐在上面
<1-18,Phoebe>So I would sit on it,

23
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:15,050
<1-18,Phoebe>我继父会拖着我在后院跑
<1-18,Phoebe>and my stepdad would drag me around the backyard.

24
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,570
<1-19,Ross>太不公平了
<1-19,Ross>That is so unfair.

25
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:20,150
<1-20,Phoebe>挺公平的  我也会拖着他跑
<1-20,Phoebe>Not really, I got to drag him around too.

37
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,200
<2-1,Chandler>你们在干什么
<2-1,Chandler>Hey, what are you guys doing?

38
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,490
<2-3,Monica>给邻居做万圣节的糖果
<2-3,Monica>Making holloween candies for the neighbors.

39
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:11,000
<2-4,Chandler>抱歉  你说谁
<2-4,Chandler>I'm sorry, who?

40
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,630
<2-5,Monica>我要在门上挂一个篮子
<2-5,Monica>I'm gonna hang a basket on the door.

41
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,810
<2-5,Monica>邻居经过就可以拿块糖
<2-5,Monica>When the neighbors walk by, they can take a piece.

42
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:21,700
<2-6,Chandler>-我们又不认识他们  -我认识
<2-6,Chandler>- But we don't know the neighbors. - I do.

43
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,820
<2-7,Joey>有一个长着小胡子的男人
<2-7,Joey>There's, let's see, the guy with the mustache...

<2-7,Joey>还有一个不喜欢被叫做"锈哥"的红头发男人
<2-7,Joey>...and a red-haired guy who does not like to be called Rusty.

46
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:36,080
<2-8,Monica>这就是我要做糖果的原因
<2-8,Monica>See, this is exactly why I'm making this candy.

47
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,050
<2-8,Monica>改善邻里关系  了解邻居背景
<2-8,Monica>We can learn their names and get to know our neighbors.

48
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,620
<2-9,Chandler>我们搬家不是更快
<2-9,Chandler>Wouldn't it be easier if we just moved?

<2-13,Monica>Where you can make out with your assistant.

53
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,860
<2-14,Rachel>那没有什么大不了的
<2-14,Rachel>It's not a big deal.

54
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:58,730
<2-14,Rachel>我们彻夜未眠
<2-14,Rachel>We stayed up all night

55
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:01,100
<2-14,Rachel>就为了保证我们的交往无后顾之忧
<2-14,Rachel>creating a plan so that us dating won't be a problem.

<2-16,Rachel>...be a problem.

60
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,610
<2-17,Monica>这就是你们彻夜未眠想出的方法
<2-17,Monica>It took you all night to come up with that plan?

61

<4-9,Joey>也许有人很喜欢吃也不一定
<4-9,Joey>Something might have happened to have a huge chunk of it.

00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,490
<5-12,Gary>你在这栋住吗
<5-12,Gary>You live in this building?

130
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,560
<5-14,Gary>我觉得我应该记得你才对
<5-14,Gary>Seems like I'd remember you.

131
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:25,640
<5-15,Chandler>晚安  盖瑞
<5-15,Chandler>Night, Gar.

132
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:40,420
<6-1,Rachel>你看了你的评估表吗
<6-1,Rachel>So did you read your evaluation yet?

133
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,960
<6-2,Tag>上面标着"机密"
<6-2,Tag>No, it was marked "Confidential."

134
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,220
<6-2,Tag>所以我送去人力资源部了
<6-2,Tag>I just sent it to human resources.

135
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,420
<6-3,Rachel>你开玩笑的对吧
<6-3,Rachel>Please, you're kidding, right?

136
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,500
<6-3,Rachel>那是为了开你玩笑写的
<6-3,Rachel>I wrote that one as a joke for you.

137
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:54,600
<6-4,Tag>人力资源部能看喜欢吗
<6-4,Tag>A joke they would appreciate?

138
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:57,180
<6-6,Tag>我不这么觉得
<6-6,Tag>I'm thinking, no.

139
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:02,250
<6-7,Rachel>-你说了什么  -我说你吻技高超
<6-7,Rachel>- What did you say? - I said you were a good kisser...

140
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:06,780
<6-7,Rachel>还有我喜欢你那小屁屁
<6-7,Rachel>...and that I liked your teeny, tiny tushy.

141
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,950
<6-8,Tag>不  别提我的屁股啊
<6-8,Tag>No, not my tushy.

142
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,280
<6-9,Rachel>后面更糟
<6-9,Rachel>It gets worse.

143
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:13,650
<6-9,Rachel>你的积极性  我写
<6-9,Rachel>About your initiative, I wrote:

144
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:17,190
<6-9,Rachel>"无需监督  他就可解开我的内衣搭钩"
<6-9,Rachel>"He was able to unook my bra with minimal supervision."

145
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:23,060
<6-9,Rachel>表现不佳的方面  我写"千万不要啊"
<6-9,Rachel>Under problems with performance, I wrote, "Dear God, I hope not."

146
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:27,730
<6-9,Rachel>之后我画了一些笑脸
<6-9,Rachel>And then... and then I drew a little smiley face.

147
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:31,170
<6-9,Rachel>还画了幅小春宫图
<6-9,Rachel>And then a small pornographic sketch.

148
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,260
<7-1,Monica>你送菲比脚踏车真的太贴心了
<7-1,Monica>That is so sweet of you to get Phoebe that bike.

149
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,760
<7-1,Monica>我听到那个故事时  差点就哭了
<7-1,Monica>When I heard the story, I almost cried.

150
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:47,520
<7-2,Joey>差点哭了
<7-2,Joey>Almost cried, huh?

151
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,130
<7-2,Joey>你听到了吗 钱德勒  "差点"哭了
<7-2,Joey>Hear that, Chandler? "Almost" Cried.

152
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:54,630
<7-3,Chandler>只要有人提到《泰坦尼克》你每次都会哭
<7-3,Chandler>Hey, you cry every time somebody talks about Titanic.

153
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,400
<7-4,Joey>他们两个只有彼此
<7-4,Joey>Those two had only each other.

154
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,070
<7-5,Ross>菲比很喜欢那脚踏车对吧
<7-5,Ross>Phobe really likes the bike, huh?

155
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:02,870
<7-6,Monica>我看到她推着它在街边走
<7-6,Monica>Oh, yeah. I saw her walking it down the street the other day.

156
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,140
<7-6,Monica>她的篮子里面还有花  那真的很美
<7-6,Monica>She had these flowers in the basket. It was so cute.

157
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:09,140
<7-7,Joey>早上我看见她推着它在公园散步
<7-7,Joey>I saw her this morning, walking it by the park.

158
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,080
<7-8,Ross>慢着  她推着脚踏车走
<7-8,Ross>Wait, she was walking the bike?

159
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:13,950
<7-8,Ross>两次都是
<7-8,Ross>Both times?

160
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,420
<8-1,Joey>-菲比  -嗨
<8-1,Joey>- Hey, Pheebs. - Oh, hi!

<8-5,Ross>菲比  你会骑脚踏车吧
<8-5,Ross>Pheebs, you do know how to ride a bike, don't you?

163
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,630
<8-6,Phoebe>当然
<8-6,Phoebe>Of course.

164
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:33,810
<8-7,Monica>我们能看你骑脚踏车吗
<8-7,Monica>Can we see you ride it?

165
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,630
<8-7,Monica>好

00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,590
<8-8,Phoebe>看
<8-8,Phoebe>See?

167
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,560
<9-1,Monica>我早就跟你说不要跟助理交住
<9-1,Monica>I told you not to get involved with your assistant.

168
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:06,130
<9-1,Monica>纸包不住火的
<9-1,Monica>There's no such thing as a secret when it comes to affairs.

169
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:09,120
<9-1,Monica>你听到了吗   钱德勒
<9-1,Monica>Did you hear that, Chandler?

170
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:11,300
<9-1,Monica>纸包不住火
<9-1,Monica>No such thing.

171
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:15,700
<9-2,Chandler>怎么了  我在吃糖
<9-2,Chandler>What happened? I'm just eating candy.

172
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:18,890
<9-3,Rachel>或许没有那么糟糕
<9-3,Rachel>Maybe it's not that bad.

173
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:21,310
<9-3,Rachel>他们可能看不懂我的意思
<9-3,Rachel>They might not take it the way I meant it.

174
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:25,240
<9-4,Chandler>当然了  因为"小屁屁"有屁股
<9-4,Chandler>Absolutely, you know? Because "Tushy" Can mean both ass...

175
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,010
<9-4,Chandler>和努力工作的员工的意思
<9-4,Chandler>...and good worker.

176
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,910
<9-5,Rachel>我得把评估表拿回来
<9-5,Rachel>I just gotta get the thing back.

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,990
<9-8,Joey>看上去像这幅吗
<9-8,Joey>Might it have looked a little like this?

179
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,160
<9-9,Rachel>天啊  乔伊
<9-9,Rachel>Oh, my God, Joey!

00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:42,370
<9-10,Chandler>-你是怎么了  -天啊
<9-10,Chandler>- What is the matter with you? - God!

181
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:48,000
<9-12,Joey>买不起成人光碟前  这点天赋还挺有用的
<9-12,Joey>This little talent came in handy before I could afford porn.

182
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:55,840
<9-13,The Woman>对不起  我知道现在是休息时间

<9-18,Monica>有人说
<9-18,Monica>Some people have said

190
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:19,360
<9-18,Monica>那是"天上掉下的礼物"  但无所谓了
<9-18,Monica>it's "Little drops of heaven. " But whatever.

<9-21,Chandler>Isn't she the woman who lives below you and has sex really loud?

<9-22,Monica>仅此一次

<9-29,Chandler>你知道什么才会有用吗  别再做糖果了
<9-29,Chandler>You know what would work? Stop making candy.

00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,980
<9-31,Chandler>你是说他们喜欢你
<9-31,Chandler>You mean they like you.

202
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,400
<9-32,Monica>也许
<9-32,Monica>Maybe.

203
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,270
<9-33,Chandler>所以你才当厨师是吧  好让人们喜欢你
<9-33,Chandler>Is that why you became a chef, so people would like you?

204
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,270
<9-34,Monica>你真想讨论
<9-34,Monica>You want to talk about

<10-2,Phoebe>Wait, this seat is really uncomfortable.

210
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,260
<10-2,Phoebe>也许开始练习前  我们可以去换一个
<10-2,Phoebe>Maybe before we start we should just get another one.

211
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,900
<10-2,Phoebe>也许飞机座椅和懒人椅都行
<10-2,Phoebe>Perhaps like an airplane seat, or a beanbag chair!

212
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:32,000
<10-3,Ross>你逃不掉的  你得学骑车
<10-3,Ross>You can't get out of this. You have to learn how to ride a bike.

213
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:35,110
<10-4,Phoebe>为什么  我为什么必须得学
<10-4,Phoebe>Why? Why do I have to learn?

<10-6,Phoebe>-以防万一  -防哪种万一
<10-6,Phoebe>- Well, in case of an emergency. - What kind of emergency?

215
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,360
<10-7,Ross>万一一个人走过来
<10-7,Ross>Well, what if a man comes along

216
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,180
<10-7,Ross>拿枪指着你的头说
<10-7,Ross>and puts a gun to your head and says:

217
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:48,050
<10-7,Ross>"快骑车否则"
<10-7,Ross>"You ride this bike or I'll...

218
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,760
<10-7,Ross>"否则我就开枪"呢
<10-7,Ross>I'll shoot you."

219
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:53,530
<10-8,Phoebe>我会按铃分散他的注意力
<10-8,Phoebe>I would ring the bell to distract him.

220
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:57,390
<10-8,Phoebe>然后我会用中国飞镖把那个家伙敲昏
<10-8,Phoebe>Then I would knock the gun away with a Chinese throwing star.

221
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:01,800
<10-9,Ross>菲比  快坐上脚踏车

236
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:03,990
<11-1,Ross>外面有人要糖吃
<11-1,Ross>Hey, there's some people outside asking about candy.

<11-4,Monica>你会打乱我的流程
<11-4,Monica>I don't need nobody messing with the system!

240
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:17,160
<11-5,Ross>还有  婚礼前一周

<12-2,Ross>我很抱歉  我放了手
<12-2,Ross>Look, I'm really sorry I let go of the bike.

244
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:39,760
<12-3,Phoebe>我可能会没命的
<12-3,Phoebe>I could've been killed, you know.

245
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,530
<12-4,Ross>我知道
<12-4,Ross>I know, I know.

246
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:47,400
<12-4,Ross>但你能再试一次吗
<12-4,Ross>But can we please try it again?

247
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,010
<12-4,Ross>你只差一点就成功了  菲比
<12-4,Ross>I mean, you were so close, Phoebe.

248
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:52,770
<12-5,Phoebe>我很乐意
<12-5,Phoebe>Well, I would love to...

249
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:56,780
<12-5,Phoebe>但脚踏车被偷了  警察找不到嫌犯
<12-5,Phoebe>...but the bike got stolen and the police have no suspects.

250
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:04,520
<12-6,Ross>-菲比  -什么
<12-6,Ross>- Phoebe. - What?

251
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,460
<12-7,Phoebe>怎么会这样
<12-7,Phoebe>What the hell?

252
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:12,020
<12-7,Phoebe>你知道吗
<12-7,Phoebe>All right, you know what?

253
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:15,360
<12-8,Ross>如果你不学骑车  那我很抱歉
<12-8,Ross>If you won't learn how to ride, then I'm sorry...

254
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:17,600
<12-8,Ross>-我得把它收回去  -什么  为什么
<12-8,Ross>...I have to take it back. - What? Why?

255
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:21,170
<12-9,Phoebe>因为
<12-9,Phoebe>Because it's...

256
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,440
<12-10,Ross>就像你买了这把吉他
<12-10,Ross>It'd be like you having this guitar...

257
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,440
<12-10,Ross>却从来不弹它
<12-10,Ross>...and never playing it.

258
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,580
<12-10,Ross>这吉他希望被弹
<12-10,Ross>Okay, this guitar wants to be played.

259
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:33,910
<12-10,Ross>这辆脚踏车希望被骑
<12-10,Ross>And this bike wants to be ridden.

260
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:36,420
<12-10,Ross>如果你不骑它
<12-10,Ross>And if you don't ride it...

261
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:40,720
<12-10,Ross>你就是在扼杀它的灵魂
<12-10,Ross>...you're killing its spirit.

262
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,100
<12-10,Ross>脚踏车
<12-10,Ross>The bike...

263
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,700
<12-10,Ross>快死了
<12-10,Ross>...is dying.

264
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,380
<12-11,Phoebe>如果你这么在乎
<12-11,Phoebe>All right. If you care enough

265
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:55,230
<12-11,Phoebe>不惜满嘴胡言  那好吧
<12-11,Phoebe>to make up that load of crap, okay.

266
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:57,130
<12-12,Ross>很好
<12-12,Ross>Great, great.

267
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,610
<12-12,Ross>脚踏车会很开心的
<12-12,Ross>You're making the bike very happy.

268
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,080
<12-13,Phoebe>好吧  罗斯
<12-13,Phoebe>Okay, Ross.

269
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:07,820
<12-13,Phoebe>拜托请别死
<12-13,Phoebe>Please don't die!

270
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:13,980
<13-1,Rachel>我们得在他们看到评估表前把它拿回来
<13-1,Rachel>To get the evaluation before they see it...

271
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:18,760
<13-1,Rachel>我们得溜进塞纳的办公室  他10点后才会来
<13-1,Rachel>...we gotta get into Zelner's office. He doesn't get in until 10.

272
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:20,430
<13-1,Rachel>但他的助理贝蒂一大早
<13-1,Rachel>But his assistant, Betty,

273
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:22,990
<13-1,Rachel>就会到办公室吃早餐
<13-1,Rachel>comes in early to eat breakfast at her desk.

274
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:26,470
<13-2,Tag>-那还挺悲凉的  -贝蒂是挺悲凉的
<13-2,Tag>- That's kind of sad. - Yeah, well, Betty's kind of sad.

275
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,640
<13-3,Rachel>所以我相信我可以用这些巧克力把她引开
<13-3,Rachel>Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates.

276
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:34,310
<13-3,Rachel>我引开她后  你就进去
<13-3,Rachel>While I distract her, you go in.

277
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,880
<13-4,Tag>-我知道了  -行动吧
<13-4,Tag>- Got it. - Let's roll.

278
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:39,680
<13-6,Mr. Zelner>瑞秋  你有空吗
<13-6,Mr. Zelner>Hello, Rachel. You got a minute?

279
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:43,220
<13-7,Rachel>当然塞纳先生  为您  什么都有
<13-7,Rachel>Yeah, sure, Mr. Zelner. For you? Anything. Minute.

280
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:45,260
<13-7,Rachel>很好
<13-7,Rachel>Okay, great.

281
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:47,090
<13-7,Rachel>计划中止
<13-7,Rachel>Abort the plan.

282
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,560
<13-8,Mr. Zelner>我要和你们俩同时谈话
<13-8,Mr. Zelner>Actually, I'd like to speak to both of you.

283
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,230
<13-8,Mr. Zelner>好
<13-8,Mr. Zelner>Okay.

284
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:57,800
<13-9,Rachel>你要点什么东西吗  巧克力
<13-9,Rachel>Well, can we get you anything, Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates.

285
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:02,110
<13-10,Mr. Zelner>不谢谢  但可以给贝蒂
<13-10,Mr. Zelner>No, thanks, but I'll give these to Betty.

286
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:06,810
<13-10,Mr. Zelner>我看过你对泰格做的评估表
<13-10,Mr. Zelner>So I read your evaluation of Tag.

287
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:10,420
<13-10,Mr. Zelner>或许我该叫他的全名泰格"小可爱"琼斯
<13-10,Mr. Zelner>Or to use his full name, Tag "Sweet Cheeks" Jones?

288
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,420
<13-10,Mr. Zelner>你们之间有什么吗
<13-10,Mr. Zelner>Is something going on with you two?

289
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:20,050
<13-11,Rachel>你能想象如果我们俩约会吗
<13-11,Rachel>Oh, my God, can you imagine if there was?

290
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:25,390
<13-11,Rachel>会有什么后果啊
<13-11,Rachel>I mean, what would happen exactly?

291
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:29,060
<13-12,Mr. Zelner>我一定得上报
<13-12,Mr. Zelner>Well, I'd be forced to file a report.

292
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:31,970
<13-12,Mr. Zelner>得找法律部咨询
<13-12,Mr. Zelner>I'd have to consult with the legal department.

293
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:35,470
<13-12,Mr. Zelner>你们在公司的未来可能会受到影响
<13-12,Mr. Zelner>And your future at the company would be in jeopardy.

294
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:38,200
<13-13,Rachel>-就  -塞纳先生
<13-13,Rachel>- Well... - Mr. Zelner...

295
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:41,080
<13-14,Tag>那份评估表是我写的
<13-14,Tag>I filled in that evaluation.

296
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,610
<13-15,Rachel>-哦  不对  -是的
<13-15,Rachel>- Oh, no... - Yeah, yeah.

297
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,880
<13-16,Tag>我以为这会很好玩
<13-16,Tag>I thought it would be funny.

298
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:48,990
<13-17,Mr. Zelner>你写着你有可爱的小屁屁
<13-17,Mr. Zelner>You wrote that you have a cute tushy?

299
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:54,220
<13-18,Tag>对  我的幽默感很奇怪
<13-18,Tag>Yes. I have a weird sense of humor.

300
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,990
<13-18,Tag>很奇怪地我以自己的屁股为荣
<13-18,Tag>And I'm kind of strangely proud of my butt.

301
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:00,660
<13-19,Mr. Zelner>开这种玩笑太危险了  泰格
<13-19,Mr. Zelner>It's kind of a risky joke, Tag.

302
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:04,000
<13-19,Mr. Zelner>这到底是在画什么   我看不懂
<13-19,Mr. Zelner>What is this drawing? I can't figure it out.

303
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:07,540
<13-20,Rachel>它倒过来了  你得  那不重要
<13-20,Rachel>It's upside down, you gotta... It doesn't matter.

304
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,440
<13-20,Rachel>我不是没有幽默感
<13-20,Rachel>It's not like I don't have a sense of humor.

305
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:15,240
<13-21,Mr. Zelner>我甚至很喜欢写打油诗
<13-21,Mr. Zelner>Hell, I even enjoy a naughty limerick every now and then.

306
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:19,510
<13-21,Mr. Zelner>但时间跟地点是很重要的
<13-21,Mr. Zelner>There's a time and a place.

307
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,250
<13-21,Mr. Zelner>除非你现在有写打油诗的灵感
<13-21,Mr. Zelner>Unless you have a limerick right now.

308
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:30,590
<13-21,Mr. Zelner>没有吗  好吧  你知道我的传真机号码
<13-21,Mr. Zelner>No? Okay. Well, you've got my fax number.

309
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,230
<13-22,Rachel>我不敢相信你会那么做  那太贴心了
<13-22,Rachel>I can't believe you did that. That was sweet.

310
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:44,210
<13-24,Rachel>-别担心  -你可能会丢掉工作
<13-24,Rachel>- Don't worry about it. - You could've lost your job.

311
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:47,750
<13-25,Tag>开什么玩笑  有着如此翘臀肯定能找到工作
<13-25,Tag>Are you kidding me? With this cute butt, I'd find work.

312
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:51,920
<13-26,Rachel>谢谢  你太棒了
<13-26,Rachel>Thank you, you're great.

313
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:55,920
<13-28,Rachel>-你知道吗  -什么
<13-28,Rachel>- You know what? - What?

314
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,990
<13-29,Tag>我很有成就感
<13-29,Tag>I feel great.

315
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:00,490
<13-29,Tag>事实上
<13-29,Tag>In fact...

316
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:06,920
<13-29,Tag>什么
<13-29,Tag>What?

317
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:10,940
<13-30,Rachel>我花了好久才整理好
<13-30,Rachel>It's just... It took me so long to get that desk organized.

318
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,000
<13-31,Tag>抱歉
<13-31,Tag>I'm sorry.

319
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:16,140
<13-32,Rachel>看到啦
<13-32,Rachel>There it is.

320
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,220
<14-1,Chandler>这是闹哪样啊
<14-1,Chandler>What is going on?

321
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,820
<14-2,The Man>我们在等糖果  把糖果拿出来
<14-2,The Man>We're waiting for the candy. Bring out the candy!

<14-3,Joey>小姐  把糖果拿出来
<14-3,Joey>Yeah, lady, give us candy!

323
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:37,990
<14-5,Joey>乔伊
<14-5,Joey>Joey!

324
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,060
<14-6,Chandler>-怎么了  -你在干嘛
<14-6,Chandler>- What's up, buddy? - What are you doing?

325
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:44,360
<14-7,Joey>等着那糖
<14-7,Joey>Waiting to get candy.

326
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:46,670
<14-8,Chandler>进来
<14-8,Chandler>Get in here.

327
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:50,280
<14-8,Chandler>你不能在这抽烟
<14-8,Chandler>Hey, and you cannot smoke in here.

328
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:55,150
<14-8,Chandler>圣诞快乐
<14-8,Chandler>Merry Christmas.

329
00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:00,580
<14-9,Monica>糖果马上就到  巧克力还需15分钟放凉
<14-9,Monica>The candy is coming! I need another 15 minutes for the chocolate to cool.

330
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,650
<14-10,All>大家伙儿  保持安静
<14-10,All>All right, everybody, just be quiet.

331
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:06,750
<14-11,Chandler>安静  安静  小声点儿
<14-11,Chandler>Be quiet! Be quiet! Pipe down!

332
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,090
<14-11,Chandler>你们都有什么毛病
<14-11,Chandler>What is the matter with you people?

333
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,520
<14-11,Chandler>这个女人想为大家
<14-11,Chandler>This woman was trying to

334
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,810
<14-11,Chandler>做点好事
<14-11,Chandler>do a nice thing for you.

335
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:16,260
<14-11,Chandler>她做糖果是为了认识你们
<14-11,Chandler>She was making candy so she could get to know all of you.

336
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,940
<14-11,Chandler>但我打赌你们没一个人知道她的名字
<14-11,Chandler>And I'll bet that not one of you can tell me her name.

337
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:21,610
<14-11,Chandler>我说对了吧
<14-11,Chandler>Am I right?

338
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,290
<14-12,The Man>糖果小姐
<14-12,The Man>Candy Lady?

339
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,930
<14-13,Chandler>才不是"糖果小姐"
<14-13,Chandler>No, not "Candy Lady."

340
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,170
<14-14,Joey>如果我们知道了  我们能拿糖果吗
<14-14,Joey>If we know it, can we have candy?

341
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,070
<14-14,Joey>行了
<14-14,Joey>All right, you know what?

342
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:36,830
<14-15,Chandler>随便吧  你们毁了这一切
<14-15,Chandler>Forget it, you've ruined it.

<14-15,Chandler>回家吧  你们毁了这一切
<14-15,Chandler>Go home. You've ruined it.

344
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:43,070
<14-16,Joey>都是你们的错  你们毁了这一切
<14-16,Joey>That's all wrong! You guys ruined everything. You ruined it!

00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,280
<14-18,Chandler>-谢谢  -不客气
<14-18,Chandler>- Thank you. - You're welcome.

346
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,450
<14-19,Monica>你抽烟了
<14-19,Monica>Did you smoke?

347
00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:01,560
<14-20,Chandler>没啊  老烟枪女士直接喷了烟到我嘴里
<14-20,Chandler>No, smokes-a-lot lady blew smoke directly into my mouth.

348
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:03,930
<14-20,Chandler>你还好吗
<14-20,Chandler>Are you okay?

349
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:06,760
<14-21,Monica>我没事  但刚刚真的有点可怕
<14-21,Monica>Fine, but it was really scary for a while.

350
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:10,060
<14-21,Monica>有人会将恐吓纸条塞到门缝下
<14-21,Monica>Someone slipped a threatening note under the door!

351
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:14,210
<14-22,Joey>我很抱歉  我的暴力倾向发作了
<14-22,Joey>Oh, yeah. Sorry about that. Mob mentality or whatever.

352
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:27,970
<15-1,Phoebe>我简直不敢相信我办到了  我会骑车了
<15-1,Phoebe>I can't believe it. I did it. I rode a bike!

353
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:31,310
<15-1,Phoebe>从来没觉得我能学会  谢谢
<15-1,Phoebe>I never thought I'd be able to do that. Thank you.

354
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:33,880
