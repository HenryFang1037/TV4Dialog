00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,540
<1-4,Monica>不行  从甜甜嘴事件我们已经学到教训了

00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:37,880
<2-7,Monica>我跟你说  记得不要送花给她
<2-7,Monica>All right, listen let me tell you, do not get her flowers. Okay?

18
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:39,670
<2-7,Monica>因为花谢了她会哭
<2-7,Monica>Because y'know, she cries when they die,

19
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,120
<2-7,Monica>还会帮花办葬礼之类的
<2-7,Monica>and there's the whole funeral...

<2-11,Monica>盖瑞要请你搬去跟他住
<2-11,Monica>Gary's gonna ask you to move in with him!!

24
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:56,360
<2-12,Phoebe>什么  真的吗
<2-12,Phoebe>What?! Really?!

25
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:57,670
<2-13,Monica>他刚才在吧台告诉我的
<2-13,Monica>He just told me at the counter.

26
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,190
<2-13,Monica>他要我保证不说出去  但我实在是憋不住了
<2-13,Monica>He made me promise not to tell, but I couldn't hold it in any longer!

27
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:02,340
<2-14,Phoebe>我不敢相信
<2-14,Phoebe>I can't believe this!

28
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:05,100
<2-15,Chandler>对  因为太快了  太快太快了
<2-15,Chandler>Right, because it's fast. Because, it's so fast. It's fast!

29
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,170
<2-16,Monica>别激动  是菲比  又不是你
<2-16,Monica>Relax! It's Phoebe! Not you!

30
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,410
<2-17,Chandler>菲比  很厉害  有一套
<2-17,Chandler>Oh! Good for you Pheebs, way to go!

31
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:14,270
<2-18,Phoebe>不过真的是太快了  不是吗
<2-18,Phoebe>No, but it is fast. Isn't it?

32
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:15,340
<2-19,Monica>不会
<2-19,Monica>No.

33
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,810
<2-20,Phoebe>我是很喜欢他  但我还没准备好要同居
<2-20,Phoebe>I like him a lot but I don't think I'm ready for this!

34
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:18,710
<2-21,Chandler>那你打算怎么办
<2-21,Chandler>So, what are you gonna do?

35
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,950
<2-22,Phoebe>不知道  兵来将挡  干脆你去跟他谈
<2-22,Phoebe>I don't know. I'll just handle it-I'll ask you to talk to him!

36
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,340
<2-23,Chandler>我  为何是我
<2-23,Chandler>Me?! Why me?

37
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:26,700
<2-24,Phoebe>因为你怕死了给承诺
<2-24,Phoebe>Because you are so afraid of commitment!

38
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,800
<2-24,Phoebe>你去跟他说说  让他跟你一样怕
<2-24,Phoebe>You talk to him, make him scared like you!

39
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,360
<2-24,Phoebe>让他成为一个男人
<2-24,Phoebe>Make him a...man!

40
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,620
<2-25,Chandler>我会去试试  但我不确定会多有用
<2-25,Chandler>I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it would do, y'know?

41
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:34,650
<2-25,Chandler>因为比起以前
<2-25,Chandler>Because I'm a lot less afraid

42
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,780
<2-25,Chandler>我现在已经没那么害怕承诺了
<2-25,Chandler>of commitment than I used to be.

43
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,510
<2-26,Monica>我好感动
<2-26,Monica>That is so sweet!

44
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,380
<2-27,Chandler>还是很怕  我会搞定的  没问题
<2-27,Chandler>Still terrified, I'll take care of it. No problem.

61
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:44,470
<3-2,Ross>是啊  所以才叫斯塔滕"岛"
<3-2,Ross>Uh-huh, that's why they call it Staten Island.

62
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,790
<3-3,Joey>我还以为跟长岛一样不是岛呢
<3-3,Joey>Ohhh. I thought it was like Long Island.

<3-4,Ross>长岛也是岛
<3-4,Ross>Also an island.

70
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,140
<3-9,Joey>我怕坏了好事才没说
<3-9,Joey>but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.

71
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,900
<3-10,Ross>我们还真会丢接球呢
<3-10,Ross>Wow! We are pretty good at this!

00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,500
<5-7,Chandler>我们或许应该聊聊
<5-7,Chandler>maybe, we should have a talk.

138
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:24,400
<5-9,Chandler>你在发什么神经
<5-9,Chandler>Are you insane?

139
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:25,420
<5-9,Chandler>如果你和菲比同居
<5-9,Chandler>If you live with Phoebe,

140
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,980
<5-9,Chandler>你们两个就会住在一起了

<5-18,Gary>我想要尽量多跟她在一起
<5-18,Gary>I just-I wanna be around her as much as I can.

158
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,960
<5-19,Chandler>怪了  这事你说出来感觉就没那么恐怖了
<5-19,Chandler>Wow, y'know when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary.

<5-20,Gary>你懂我的意思吧
<5-20,Gary>See you know what I'm talking about, right?

<6-1,Ross>How did it get there?!

170
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:40,520
<6-2,Joey>或许这个游戏应该安静一点
<6-2,Joey>Maybe this should be more of a quiet game.

<6-20,Rachel>恭喜了  真是浪费时间的好办法
<6-20,Rachel>Oh, wow! Congratulations, that's quite a waste of time.

<6-21,Monica>-瑞秋  -怎么了

<6-24,Rachel>是我的猫
<6-24,Rachel>Well, it's my cat.

197
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,490
<6-25,Monica>什么

00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,530
<6-26,Rachel>对了  我养了一只猫

00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,730
<6-27,Monica>我不想养猫
<6-27,Monica>I don't want a cat!

200
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,890
<6-28,Joey>别担心  那不是猫
<6-28,Joey>Oh, don't worry, it's not a cat.

201
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:51,590
<6-29,Ross>没错
<6-29,Ross>Yeah.

202
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:56,880
<6-30,Rachel>这只猫跟我奶奶养过的猫完全不一样
<6-30,Rachel>You guys this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat.

203
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:59,470
<6-30,Rachel>既不讨人喜欢  也不可爱
<6-30,Rachel>I mean, it's not sweet, it's not cute,

204
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,730
<6-30,Rachel>我在地上拉着线逗它玩
<6-30,Rachel>I even dragged that little string on the ground,

205
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:04,620
<6-30,Rachel>它竟然发飙  把我抓得乱七八糟
<6-30,Rachel>and it just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me.

206
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:07,890
<6-30,Rachel>我知道这听来很疯狂  但我发誓
<6-30,Rachel>And I swear, I know this sounds crazy,

207
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:10,300
<6-30,Rachel>这只猫每次冲我发出嘶嘶声
<6-30,Rachel>but every time this cat hisses at me

208
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,810
<6-30,Rachel>我知道它都在说"瑞秋"
<6-30,Rachel>I know it's saying, "Rachel!"

209
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:22,500
<6-31,Ross>不及花一千块买一只猫疯狂
<6-31,Ross>Doesn't sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat.

210
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:26,150
<6-32,Monica>你欠我三百块不还  还拿一千块去买猫
<6-32,Monica>What?! You paid a thousand dollars for a cat when you owe me 300!!

211
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,180
<6-33,Rachel>我本来打算让你跟它玩的
<6-33,Rachel>Well, I was gonna let you play with it.

212
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,050
<7-2,Phoebe>你跟盖瑞聊过同居的事没
<7-2,Phoebe>Hmm, did you talk to Gary about the moving in thing?

213
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,380
<7-3,Chandler>聊过了  我觉得你应该答应
<7-3,Chandler>Yes I did, and I think you should do it.

214
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,360
<7-4,Phoebe>什么
<7-4,Phoebe>What?!

215
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,800
<7-5,Chandler>他很棒
<7-5,Chandler>He's a great guy, y'know?

216
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:46,890
<7-5,Chandler>他也很爱你  你非常幸运
<7-5,Chandler>And he loves you a lot, you are a very lucky lady.

217
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,290
<7-6,Phoebe>你真没用
<7-6,Phoebe>You are useless!

218
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:53,500
<7-6,Phoebe>害怕承诺是你唯一会做的事
<7-6,Phoebe>Freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do!

219
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:56,280
<7-6,Phoebe>你连唯一会做的都做不好  天啊
<7-6,Phoebe>The one thing! And you can't even do that right! God!

220
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,170
<7-6,Phoebe>抱歉
<7-6,Phoebe>I'm sorry.

221
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,690
<7-7,Chandler>换作我都愿意和他同居
<7-7,Chandler>If you ask me, I'd move in with him.

222
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,600
<7-8,Phoebe>天啊  你滚吧  没用鬼
<7-8,Phoebe>God! Ooh! Get out of here, good for nothing.

223
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:08,170
<7-9,Gary>钱德勒
<7-9,Gary>Hey Chandler.

224

<7-10,Chandler>小盖

00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,870
<7-11,Gary>亲爱的

<7-11,Gary>-能不能先聊一下  -好啊
<7-11,Gary>- Hi, can I talk to you for a second? - Yeah! Okay.

<7-13,Gary>你今天很美
<7-13,Gary>You look very pretty today.

228
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,060
<7-14,Phoebe>谢谢
<7-14,Phoebe>Thanks! Okay.

229
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,480
<7-15,Gary>是这样的
<7-15,Gary>Here's the thing.

230
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:27,320
<7-16,Phoebe>我很想让这段关系更进一步
<7-16,Phoebe>Y'know I really want to move this relationship forward.

231
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,710
<7-18,Phoebe>因为  不更进一步
<7-18,Phoebe>Because if you're not moving forward, y'know

232
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,910
<7-19,Gary>就会不进则退
<7-19,Gary>you're just moving backwards.

233
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,350
<7-20,Phoebe>不对
<7-20,Phoebe>No that's not true.

234
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,630
<7-20,Phoebe>如果不进  就是静止不动
<7-20,Phoebe>If you're not moving forward, you're just staying still.

235
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,600
<7-20,Phoebe>静止不动是很好的  你看
<7-20,Phoebe>And staying still is good. Watch this.

236
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:43,150
<7-21,Gary>菲比  我要你搬来和我一起住
<7-21,Gary>Phoebe, I want you to move in with me.

237
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:45,550
<7-23,Gary>你好贴心
<7-23,Gary>That is so sweet.

238
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,810
<7-24,Phoebe>但你不觉得太快了些吗
<7-24,Phoebe>But don't you think it's a little too soon?

239
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:51,470
<7-24,Phoebe>我们彼此还有太多地方不了解
<7-24,Phoebe>I mean there's so much we don't know about each other.

240
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,600
<7-25,Gary>好吧  我懂了
<7-25,Gary>Oh. Oh-oh-okay, I get it.

241
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:02,080
<7-26,Phoebe>我只是不希望我们操之过急
<7-26,Phoebe>I just-I don't want us to jump into something we're not ready for.

242
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,450
<7-27,Gary>我不想搞砸我们现在所拥有的
<7-27,Gary>I really don't want to mess up what we have.

243
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,760
<7-28,Phoebe>我只是担心同居会铸成大错
<7-28,Phoebe>I'm just-I'm worried it's gonna be a big mistake.

244
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:17,960
<7-29,Gary>所以我的答案是我答应
<7-29,Gary>Which is why my answer is yes!

245
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,580
<7-31,Gary>真的吗

00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:23,310
<7-32,Phoebe>是啊  我好快乐
<7-32,Phoebe>Uh-huh! I'm so...happy.

00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:32,360
<8-1,Ross>莫妮卡  别丢那么大力
<8-1,Ross>Monica! Stop throwing it so hard!

<8-2,Chandler>四个小时  你们就这样丢了四个小时
<8-2,Chandler>Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?

00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,760
<8-5,Monica>不行  不行
<8-5,Monica>No-no! Don't do it! Don't!

253
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:46,940
<8-6,Chandler>什么
<8-6,Chandler>What?

254
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,800
<8-7,Monica>他是手滑大王
<8-7,Monica>He's a dropper!

255
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:53,700
<8-8,Joey>对  没错
<8-8,Joey>Oh yeah, that's right!

256
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:56,100
<8-9,Chandler>我才不是手滑大王
<8-9,Chandler>I'm not a dropper!

257
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,480
<8-10,Ross>这其实是三个人的游戏
<8-10,Ross>It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?

258
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:02,600
<8-11,Chandler>还不就是你丢我接
<8-11,Chandler>It's throwing and catching!

259
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:04,360
<8-12,Ross>好吧
<8-12,Ross>All right.

260
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,020
<8-13,Chandler>好大力哦
<8-13,Chandler>Oh! Oh! That's so hard.

261
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,560
<8-14,Joey>别紧张  那不是猫
<8-14,Joey>Whoa-whoa you guys, it's not a cat!

262
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:24,500
<8-15,Monica>我的天啊
<8-15,Monica>Oh my-Oh good God!

263
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:27,110
<8-16,Rachel>我放弃了  我不知道要怎么处理
<8-16,Rachel>I give up you guys, I don't know what I'm going to do with this thing!

264
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:31,030
<8-17,Ross>送它进烤箱也没用吗
<8-17,Ross>Baking it didn't help, huh?

265
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,860
<8-18,Monica>把它送回你买的地方呢
<8-18,Monica>So, why don't you just take it back to where you got it?

266
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,850
<8-19,Rachel>我试过了  他们不收
<8-19,Rachel>I tried! They won't take her back.

267
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,820
<8-20,Chandler>或许是因为它是反基督的爪牙
<8-20,Chandler>Maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-Christ.

268
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:45,470
<8-21,Monica>瑞秋  店家为什么不收
<8-21,Monica>Rach, why won't they take it back?

269
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,250
<8-22,Rachel>他们说要收回可以  但只退我店里的购物券
<8-22,Rachel>Well, they said would but they would only give me store credit.

270
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,150
<8-22,Rachel>我要拿来买什么  一千只普通的猫不成
<8-22,Rachel>I mean, what am I going to do, get a thousand regular cats?

271
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:54,090
<8-23,Monica>那就先留在家里
<8-23,Monica>Look, if you want you can keep it at our place

272
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:55,070
<8-23,Monica>直到你找到处理的方法
<8-23,Monica>until you find out what to do with it.

273
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:57,760
<8-24,Rachel>莫妮卡  那不是重点  我破费一千块
<8-24,Rachel>No Mon that's not the point. I'm out a thousand dollars,

274
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:59,600
<8-24,Rachel>搞得全身都是抓痕
<8-24,Rachel>I'm all scratched up,

275
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,550
<8-24,Rachel>还跟长得像手的蠢猫困在一起
<8-24,Rachel>and I'm stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand!

276
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:09,380
<8-25,Monica>天啊  那只猫害我流眼泪了
<8-25,Monica>Oh my God, the cat's made my eyes water!

277
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:10,870
<8-25,Monica>别丢球给我
<8-25,Monica>Don't-don't throw it to me!

278
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,210
<8-25,Monica>我的视力受损
<8-25,Monica>My vision's been compromised!!

279
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:19,080
<8-25,Monica>天啊  好了  现在好了
<8-25,Monica>Oh God! Okay. Okay. It's okay.

280
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,450
<8-25,Monica>刚才好险
<8-25,Monica>Man, that was close.

281
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,020
<8-26,Chandler>是啊  你差点就反应太大了
<8-26,Chandler>Yeah, you almost overreacted to something.

282
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,590
<8-29,Gary>我们有个好消息
<8-29,Gary>We have great news!

283
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,100
<8-30,Phoebe>我们要同居了  是不是很棒
<8-30,Phoebe>We're moving in together! Isn't it great! Yay!

284
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,490
<8-31,All>恭喜

285
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:34,740
<8-32,Phoebe>是啊  我好激动
<8-32,Phoebe>I know, I'm so excited!

286
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:35,380
<8-33,Gary>我也是
<8-33,Gary>So am I!

287
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:36,760
<8-34,Phoebe>你才没有我激动
<8-34,Phoebe>Well, you're not more excited than I am!

288
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:38,460
<8-34,Phoebe>不可能  我是最激动的
<8-34,Phoebe>No way! I'm the most excited!

289
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,260
<8-35,Gary>好  晚点在局里见
<8-35,Gary>Okay, I'll see you at the station later.

290
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:44,100
<8-36,Phoebe>好  晚点见  别忘了同居的事哦
<8-36,Phoebe>Okay, yeah, I'll see you later! Don't forget about the moving in!

291
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,620
<8-38,Monica>你要搬去跟他住  怎么了
<8-38,Monica>So you're moving in with him. What happened?

292
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,290
<8-39,Phoebe>看他伤心成那样  我不忍心拒绝他
<8-39,Phoebe>I couldn't tell him no. He got so sad.

293
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,110
<8-39,Phoebe>或许这样挺好
<8-39,Phoebe>Maybe it'll be all right.

294
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,980
<8-39,Phoebe>我真的很喜欢他
<8-39,Phoebe>I do really like him a lot

295
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:56,450
<8-39,Phoebe>同居八成也是迟早的事
<8-39,Phoebe>and probably do it eventually anyway

296
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,420
<8-39,Phoebe>想想也可以省下不少邮票钱
<8-39,Phoebe>and plus, think of all the money I'll save on stamps.

297
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:02,300
<8-40,Monica>怎么着  你常写信给他
<8-40,Monica>Why, do you write him a lot?

298
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:04,470
<8-41,Phoebe>不是  只是我听说同居的人
<8-41,Phoebe>No, I just heard when people live together,

299
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,030
<8-41,Phoebe>会分担邮票的费用  不是吗
<8-41,Phoebe>they split the cost of stamps. Don't they?

300
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,140
<8-42,All>-是啊  -没错

<9-15,Gary>'Cause uh, this is today's Post

322
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:25,070
<9-15,Gary>我找到了这些租屋广告
<9-15,Gary>and uh, these are the listings I found.

323
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:27,320
<9-15,Gary>布鲁克林高地  两房
<9-15,Gary>Brooklyn Heights, two bedroom.

324
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:28,850
<9-15,Gary>布鲁克林高地  一房
<9-15,Gary>Brooklyn Heights, one bedroom.

325
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,620
<9-15,Gary>全是布鲁克林高地
<9-15,Gary>Brooklyn Heights,  Brooklyn Heights,  Brooklyn Heights!

326
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:34,080
<9-16,Phoebe>这些是要出租的吗
<9-16,Phoebe>Are these for rent!

327
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,600
<9-16,Phoebe>我以为他们是在炫耀自己的房子有多棒
<9-16,Phoebe>I thought people were just bragging!

328
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,050
<9-17,Gary>我来告诉你我的想法
<9-17,Gary>Let me tell you what I think might be going on.

329
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,020
<9-17,Gary>不要看桌子  看着我
<9-17,Gary>No-no-no, don't look at the table. Look at me.

330
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,650
<9-17,Gary>我认为一个男生邀请一个女生同居
<9-17,Gary>Okay, I think somebody asked someone to move in with them.

331
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,160
<9-17,Gary>女生本来说好  现在反悔了
<9-17,Gary>And I think someone said, "Yes" but now she's having doubts

332
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:51,390
<9-17,Gary>因为女生觉得这样太快了
<9-17,Gary>because things are moving to fast for someone.

333
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,380
<9-17,Gary>你觉得是不是这样
<9-17,Gary>Does that sound at all possible to you?

334
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:58,210
<9-18,Phoebe>对  好  我就是那个女生
<9-18,Phoebe>Yes. Yes! Fine! I am someone!

335
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:03,120
<9-18,Phoebe>你要我说老实话  我是不确定
<9-18,Phoebe>You want me to say it? I have doubts!

336
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,720
<9-19,Gary>对不起
<9-19,Gary>I'm sorry!

337
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,440
<9-20,Phoebe>菲比
<9-20,Phoebe>Phoebe.

338
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,390
<9-21,Gary>菲比  你有这种感觉也没关系
<9-21,Gary>Phoebe, it's okay that you feel this way.

339
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,310
<9-21,Gary>这真的是很快
<9-21,Gary>I mean it is soon.

340
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,030
<9-21,Gary>我们对彼此还有许多地方不了解
<9-21,Gary>And there's a lot of things we don't know about each other,

341
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,300
<9-21,Gary>我只是觉得
<9-21,Gary>and I just figure that

342
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,380
<9-21,Gary>我知道的你  我都很喜欢
<9-21,Gary>everything I know about you I really like.

343
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:19,620
<9-21,Gary>我还不知道的  就等同居后
<9-21,Gary>And the things I don't know, I get to learn about at someplace

344
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,660
<9-21,Gary>再慢慢了解
<9-21,Gary>with both our names on the mailbox.

345
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:24,350
<9-22,Phoebe>那样好甜蜜哦
<9-22,Phoebe>That's so sweet.

346
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,580
<9-23,Gary>亲爱的  但这些都不重要
<9-23,Gary>Sweethart, but none of that matters

347
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:28,860
<9-23,Gary>如果你觉得太快
<9-23,Gary>if it's too soon for you.

348
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:30,530
<9-23,Gary>没关系的  我们不用现在就同居
<9-23,Gary>It's fine! We don't have to move in together.

349
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,040
<9-23,Gary>我只要你快乐
<9-23,Gary>I just-I want you to be happy.

350
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,740
<9-24,Phoebe>跟你同居会让我快乐的
<9-24,Phoebe>Living with you would make me happy.

351
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,310
<9-25,Gary>菲比  你不用这样说
<9-25,Gary>Phoebe, you don't have to say that.

352
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,030
<9-26,Phoebe>不  我很想跟你住在一起  我要跟你同居
<9-26,Phoebe>No, I really wanna live with you! I wanna move in with you!

353
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,210
<9-27,Gary>你确定吗
<9-27,Gary>Are you sure?

354
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,690
<9-28,Phoebe>对  百分之百确定
<9-28,Phoebe>Yes. Definitely! Yes!

355

<9-30,Phoebe>镜子后面的人  你看个什么劲啊
<9-30,Phoebe>Hey you! Behind the glass! Who are you looking at!

00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,710
<9-30,Phoebe>我每次进来这种房间
<9-30,Phoebe>I've always wanted to say that everytime

360
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,210
<9-30,Phoebe>都想说这句话  虽然我从没进来过
<9-30,Phoebe>when I was in one of these rooms, which was never!

<10-2,Rachel>这不是宝宝  这是猫
<10-2,Rachel>It's not a baby! It's a cat!

375
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:41,140
<10-5,Rachel>有可能  我正考虑要养猫
<10-5,Rachel>Maybe. I was thinking about getting a cat,

376
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:42,940
<10-6,Rachel>我正好要去流浪动物之家
<10-6,Rachel>I was just going to go to the shelter but...

377
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,180
<10-6,Rachel>好吧  就它了
<10-6,Rachel>Okay, why not?

378
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,780
<10-6,Rachel>太好了  总共是两千块
<10-6,Rachel>Oh, terrific! That'll be $2,000.

379
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:48,540
<10-6,Rachel>什么
<10-6,Rachel>What?!

380
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:49,710
<10-7,Rachel>好吧  一千
<10-7,Rachel>Okay, a thousand.

381
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:52,210
<12-1,Monica>我以为你是要我认养你的猫
<12-1,Monica>I thought you wanted to adopt your cat.

382
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,710
<10-7,Rachel>是啊  不过这不只是猫
<10-7,Rachel>Well, I do, but you're just gonna have to actually look at this

383
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,850
<10-8,Rachel>更是一项投资
<10-8,Rachel>as more of an investment than a cat.

384
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,970
<10-8,Rachel>好吧  我要的只是猫
<10-8,Rachel>Okay, yeah, I just wanted a cat.

385
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:04,860
<10-9,Rachel>你显然是砍价高手
<10-9,Rachel>Obviously you know how to haggle,

386
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:07,130
<10-9,Rachel>所以我就不唬弄你了
<10-9,Rachel>so I'm not gonna try and take you on. Okay?

387
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:09,910
<10-9,Rachel>算你八百  我也不报警了
<10-9,Rachel>So $800 and I don't call the cops which I should

388
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,170
<10-9,Rachel>因为你这根本是在抢劫
<10-9,Rachel>because you're robbing me blind! Blind!

389
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:16,880
<10-9,Rachel>把钱留下猫带走  溜之大吉吧  可恶
<10-9,Rachel>Just take cat, leave the money, and run away! Run away!  Damn it!

390
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:20,700
<10-9,Rachel>死猫  你起码也笑一下嘛
