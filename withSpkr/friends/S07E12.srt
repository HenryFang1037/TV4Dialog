<6-2,Monica>With a wok?

92
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,640

98
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:22,930
<6-5,Chandler>像我们第一次约会时那样  会很有趣的
<6-5,Chandler>Like we did when we were first going out. It'd be fun.

99
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,970
<6-6,Monica>-听起来是很有意思  -对
<6-6,Monica>- Okay, that does sound fun. - Yeah.

<7-8,Tag>Like what?

115
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:23,120
<7-9,Rachel>像是你把电话放在裤子里

00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,130
<7-9,Rachel>泰格  我认真的  这不好笑

<7-11,Rachel>"今天一定要寄出"
<7-11,Rachel>"Must go out today,"

121
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,510
<7-11,Rachel>还在"今天"下面划了三道
<7-11,Rachel>And I underlined "Today" Three times.

122
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:41,340
<7-11,Rachel>我还在角落画了一颗心
<7-11,Rachel>Then I put a little heart in the corner

123
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:44,210
<7-11,Rachel>因为我不想太颐指气使
<7-11,Rachel>because I didn't wanna seem too bossy.

<7-14,Tag>不  我会看到你很窘迫
<7-14,Tag>No, I'd see you looking embarrassed

128
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:55,720
<7-14,Tag>因为合约就不在我办公桌上
<7-14,Tag>because they are not on my desk.

129
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:57,950
<7-15,Rachel>也许我会因为你用裤裆接电话
<7-15,Rachel>Maybe I'd look embarrassed

130
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:00,630
<7-15,Rachel>所以才看起来很窘迫
<7-15,Rachel>because you're talking on the phone with your crotch.

131
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,730
<7-16,Tag>你想现在去办公室吗
<7-16,Tag>You want to go to the office now?

132
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:07,130
<7-17,Rachel>很晚了  我们别去办公室了
<7-17,Rachel>Come on, it's late. We're not going down to the office.

133
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:11,140
<7-18,Tag>我理解  我也不想被证明自己是错的
<7-18,Tag>Yeah, I understand. I wouldn't want to be proved wrong either.

134
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:13,610
<7-19,Rachel>好  拿上你的外套
<7-19,Rachel>All right, get your coat!

135
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:18,840
<7-19,Rachel>你什么时候解开的  不错啊
<7-19,Rachel>Oh! When did you unook this? Nice work!

136
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:29,860
<8-1,Joey>下不去了  卡住了
<8-1,Joey>It won't go down any further. It's stuck.

137
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,590
<8-2,Ross>我们只有跳下去
<8-2,Ross>We're just gonna have to jump.

138
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,160
<8-2,Ross>我们一定要确定着陆在
<8-2,Ross>Now, we're gonna have to make sure to land...

139
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,770
<8-2,Ross>那块冰的右边  好吗
<8-2,Ross>...to the right of that patch of ice, okay?

140
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:44,670
<8-2,Ross>不要撞到旁边的垃圾桶
<8-2,Ross>Not hit the dumpster on the other side.

141
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:50,720
<8-2,Ross>试着避开中间那棕红色的奇怪东西
<8-2,Ross>And try to avoid that weird brownish-red stuff in the middle.

142
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:54,480
<8-2,Ross>当你到下面以后
<8-2,Ross>So when you get down there...

143
00:09:56,460 --> 00:10:01,360
<8-2,Ross>你去屋顶开门让我进去
<8-2,Ross>...you go up to the roof and you let me in.

144
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,950
<8-3,Joey>-慢着  必须得我跳  -没事啦
<8-3,Joey>- Wait a minute. I have to do it? - You'll be fine.

145
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:07,830
<8-4,Ross>就像蹦极一样
<8-4,Ross>It'll be just like bungee jumping, you know?

146
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:12,200
<8-4,Ross>但你就是不会弹上来罢了
<8-4,Ross>But instead of bouncing back up, you won't.

147
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:17,640
<8-5,Joey>要是我的头撞到水泥地了呢
<8-5,Joey>Well, what if I smack my head on the concrete?

148
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:21,370
<8-6,Ross>乔伊  我不想骗你  是有这个可能的
<8-6,Ross>Well, I'm not gonna lie to you, Joey. It's a possibility.

149
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:28,010
<8-7,Joey>我不知道  我们扔硬币决定谁去
<8-7,Joey>I don't know. Tell you what, let's flip to see who does it.

150
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:31,190
<8-7,Joey>-到空中再说你要哪一面  -好
<8-7,Joey>- You call it in the air, all right? - Oh, all right.

151
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,730
<8-8,Ross>-你能看见是哪一面吗  -看不到
<8-8,Ross>- Can you see what it is? - No.

152
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:42,230
<8-10,Ross>-你小心一点  -罗斯 不要这样
<8-10,Ross>- Okay. Well, you be careful. - No, Ross, stop it.

153
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,560
<8-11,Joey>我不跳
<8-11,Joey>I'm not jumping.

154
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:45,860
<8-11,Joey>我明天还有试镜
<8-11,Joey>Look, I have an audition tomorrow,

155
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,900
<8-11,Joey>如果摔断腿就不能去了
<8-11,Joey>and I can't go if I break my leg.

156
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:50,570
<8-12,Ross>我也不跳  我可是有儿子的人
<8-12,Ross>Well, I'm not jumping. I have a son.

157
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:52,740
<8-12,Ross>我死了他就没爸了
<8-12,Ross>He won't have a father if I die.

158
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:54,850
<8-13,Joey>看来我们平手
<8-13,Joey>So it looks like we're even.

159
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:02,880
<9-1,Phoebe>好  这条线
<9-1,Phoebe>Okay, so this wire...

160
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:07,060
<9-1,Phoebe>接着这条线  插到这儿
<9-1,Phoebe>...is connected to this wire, which plugs into here.

161
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:11,860
<9-1,Phoebe>想让哔声停止  我只要
<9-1,Phoebe>Okay, so to get the beeping to stop, all I have to do...

<9-1,Phoebe>Okay. Feel free to look...

168
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:58,990
<11-1,Tag>不过我告诉你  合约没在这张桌上
<11-1,Tag>...but I'm telling you, those contracts are not on this desk.

169
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:01,790
<11-2,Rachel>你怎么可能知道  你看看有多乱泰格
<11-2,Rachel>How could you possibly know? Look at this mess, Tag.

170
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:05,160
<11-2,Rachel>我告诉过你了  要有条理一点
<11-2,Rachel>This is what I'm talking about. You have to be more organized.

171
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,320
<11-2,Rachel>有报纸  有杂志
<11-2,Rachel>You've got newspapers, you've got magazines, you... Oh!

172
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,270
<11-2,Rachel>这小妞是谁
<11-2,Rachel>And who's this chippy?

173
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:15,130
<11-2,Rachel>对你来说太幼稚一点  随便啦
<11-2,Rachel>A little young for you, Tag, but whatever.

174
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,470
<11-3,Tag>是我妹
<11-3,Tag>That's my sister.

175
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,310
<11-4,Rachel>真的  牙套好可爱
<11-4,Rachel>Really? Very cute braces.

176
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:24,410
<11-4,Rachel>无所谓啦  关键在于  开始找吧
<11-4,Rachel>Anyway, you know what? The point is, Tag, start looking...

177
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:27,880
<11-4,Rachel>你会在你桌上找到那合约
<11-4,Rachel>...because you're gonna find those contracts on your desk.

178
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:33,520
<11-5,Tag>你觉得你是什么时候给我的  上午还是下午
<11-5,Tag>So when do you imagine you gave them to me? Morning or afternoon?

179
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:37,890
<11-6,Rachel>下午  塞纳先生午饭后来我这里了一趟
<11-6,Rachel>In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch...

180
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:41,560
<11-6,Rachel>他把合约放在我桌上  然后我贴了即时贴
<11-6,Rachel>...he put them on my desk, and then I put a Post-it on it...

181
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,660
<11-6,Rachel>写着
<11-6,Rachel>...that said:

182
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,900
<11-6,Rachel>"今天一定要寄出"
<11-6,Rachel>"Must go out today."

183
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,740
<11-6,Rachel>请你继续找  好吗
<11-6,Rachel>So you just keep looking in there, all right?

184
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:01,100
<12-1,Tag>不在这里
<12-1,Tag>They're not here.

185
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:03,800
<12-2,Rachel>奇怪
<12-2,Rachel>Puzzler.

186
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,000
<12-2,Rachel>真奇怪
<12-2,Rachel>Bit of a puzzle.

187
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,260
<12-2,Rachel>你去影印室找一找
<12-2,Rachel>Why don't you check the copy room.

188
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,240
<12-2,Rachel>也许你落在那了
<12-2,Rachel>Maybe you left the contracts in there.

189
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:16,310
<12-3,Tag>-我怎么可能放在那儿  -我不知道
<12-3,Tag>- How could I have left them there? - I don't know.

190
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,980
<12-4,Rachel>你的私处怎么可能打电话
<12-4,Rachel>How can your genitals make phone calls?

191
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:23,490
<12-4,Rachel>这并非完美世界  去找找行吗
<12-4,Rachel>Okay? It's not a perfect world. Just go, please?

192
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,320
<12-6,Rachel>-行  -谢谢

00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,830
<13-4,Chandler>我希望你不是想要打扫客厅
<13-4,Chandler>I hope you're not thinking about cleaning the living room.

<14-1,Joey>我饿死了  晚饭的时候我都吃了些什么啊
<14-1,Joey>Man, I'm starving. What the hell was I thinking at dinner?

<14-1,Joey>"要汤还是沙拉"  当然永远都是两者都要
<14-1,Joey>"Do you want soup or salad?" Both, always order both.

204
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:34,190
<14-2,Ross>我看了半天  我想没人在家
<14-2,Ross>You know, I'm looking, and I don't think anyone's home here.

205
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:37,060
<14-2,Ross>我们应该打破玻璃
<14-2,Ross>I say we just break the window...

206
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,520
<14-2,Ross>爬进去
<14-2,Ross>...crawl through...

207
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:41,100
<14-2,Ross>过会再解释
<14-2,Ross>...and you know, explain later.

208
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:43,200
<14-4,Ross>-没人在家  -应该没人
<14-4,Ross>- No one's home? - I don't think so.

209
