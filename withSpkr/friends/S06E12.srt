00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:06,150
<1-1,Ross>你们一定不敢不信

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,720
<1-3,Ross>我不知道《花花公子》也登笑话
<1-3,Ross>I didn't know they print jokes.

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:18,230
<1-3,Ross>他们有笑话  专访  扎实的新闻报导
<1-3,Ross>They print jokes, interviews, hard-hitting journalism.

6
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:19,990
<1-3,Ross>并非只有裸女图片
<1-3,Ross>It's not just about the pictures.

7
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:22,730
<1-4,Monica>当年妈不信你  现在我们也不可能会信

12
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,180
<1-8,Chandler>-什么  -这则笑话是我编的
<1-8,Chandler>- What? - I made that joke up.

<1-13,Rachel>那则很好笑
<1-13,Rachel>Man, that one is funny.

20
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,400
<1-14,Chandler>莫妮卡  你记得我跟你说过那则笑话吧

24
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:13,160

<1-18,Ross>But if it makes you feel any better,

25
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,540
<1-18,Ross>或者这样你会好过点
<1-18,Ross>they don't print the name.

26
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:17,040
<1-18,Ross>所以是谁的并不重要  对吧
<1-18,Ross>So it doesn't really matter who gets credit.

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,460
<1-19,Chandler>大概吧

126
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,780
<4-18,Joey>因而我必须尽量避免奢侈行为
<4-18,Joey>I've had to cut down on some luxuries like...

127
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,430
<4-18,Joey>像付帐之类的
<4-18,Joey>...paying for stuff, so....

<5-1,Monica>I mean, she tried to back out of it, but it was obvious.

142
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:04,260
<5-1,Monica>她选瑞秋

153
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,370
<5-10,Chandler>也许是罗斯爬进我的脑袋
<5-10,Chandler>Maybe it's the sound of Ross climbing into my brain

154
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:40,200
<5-10,Chandler>窃取我的思绪
<5-10,Chandler>to steal my thoughts.

00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,920
<5-17,Monica>我们前两天的欢乐时光
<5-17,Monica>we had at my place the other day.

163
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:15,270
<5-17,Monica>就是你选瑞秋不选我那次
<5-17,Monica>Remember? When you picked Rachel over me?

00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,500
<5-17,Monica>蛮好玩的

<5-19,Monica>-是挺好玩的  -一点也不好玩
<5-19,Monica>- lt was kind of funny. - lt wasn't funny at all!

166
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:24,010
<5-19,Monica>你为什么选她
<5-19,Monica>Why would you do that?

167
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,180
<5-19,Monica>为什么不选我

<5-19,Monica>好
<5-19,Monica>Fine.

169
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:32,260
<5-20,Phoebe>我之所以比较倾向瑞秋
<5-20,Phoebe>The reason that I was leaning a little bit more toward Rachel than you

170
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,160
<5-20,Phoebe>是因为你...
<5-20,Phoebe>...is just, you know, you're...

171
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:35,920
<5-20,Phoebe>有点难搞
<5-20,Phoebe>...kinda high maintenance

174
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,600
<5-21,Monica>你觉得我难搞
<5-21,Monica>You think I'm high maintenance?

<5-21,Monica>No, you're right, you're easygoing.

178
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:54,290
<5-22,Phoebe>你只是没有瑞秋那么好相处
<5-22,Phoebe>You're just not as easygoing as Rachel.

179
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:57,820
<5-22,Phoebe>她比较有弹性  比较圆滑
<5-22,Phoebe>She's just more flexible and-and mellow.

180
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:58,590
<5-22,Phoebe>就这样
<5-22,Phoebe>That's all.

181

<5-23,Rachel>每个人都不一样
<5-23,Rachel>Well, people are different.

00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,080
<5-24,Phoebe>瑞秋什么都好
<5-24,Phoebe>Rachel will do whatever you want.

183
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,890
<5-24,Phoebe>怎么欺负她都行
<5-24,Phoebe>You can just walk all over her.

<7-17,Monica>-乔伊  你在这里打工吗  -没有

<8-1,Monica>你为什么不告诉我们  你在这里工作
<8-1,Monica>Why didn't you tell us you work here?

223
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,840
<8-2,Joey>这件事蛮尴尬的
<8-2,Joey>It's kind of embarrassing.

<8-2,Joey>我之前是演员  现在是服务员
<8-2,Joey>I mean, I was an actor, now I'm a waiter.

225
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:11,650
<8-2,Joey>这有点背道而驰
<8-2,Joey>It's supposed to go the other direction.

226
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:15,400
<8-3,Chandler>就象你的围裙  它现在成了个披风
<8-3,Chandler>So's your apron. You're wearing it like a cape.

227
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:19,810
<8-4,Joey>这份工作很简单  薪水很高
<8-4,Joey>I mean, the job's easy and the money's good, you know?

228
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:21,860
<8-4,Joey>反正我都在这混

229
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,930
<8-4,Joey>干脆赚个钱呗
<8-4,Joey>I might as well get paid for it, right?

230
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,550
<8-4,Joey>只是要招呼你们感觉很怪
<8-4,Joey>I just feel kind of weird serving you guys, you know?

231
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:28,880
<8-4,Joey>会好起来的
<8-4,Joey>It'll be great.

232
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,550
<8-5,Rachel>乔伊  我也做过  其实也还好啊
<8-5,Rachel>Come on, Joey, I did it and it was fine.

233
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:33,310
<8-6,Ross>对啊  怎么会怪
<8-6,Ross>Why would it be weird?

234
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,530
<8-6,Ross>乔伊  给我来杯咖啡
<8-6,Ross>Hey, Joey? Can I get some coffee?

235
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,750
<8-7,Joey>好吧  确实没那么怪
<8-7,Joey>Okay, I guess it doesn't seem that weird.

236
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,690
<8-8,Ross>我说真的  我早就点了  现在还没端来
<8-8,Ross>Seriously, I-I asked you before and you still haven't gotten it.

237
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:46,450
<8-9,Joey>现在又变怪了
<8-9,Joey>See, now it's weird again.

238

<8-10,Chandler>你来这里工作是好事
<8-10,Chandler>I think it's great that you work here.

00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:19,820
<8-11,Rachel>有人对你不客气  就朝松饼打喷嚏
<8-11,Rachel>And if anyone is ever rude to you, sneeze muffin.

<8-12,Joey>不如你们先行退下  好让我招待几个新顾客
<8-12,Joey>How about clearing out so I can get some new customers?

253
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:33,450
<8-12,Joey>有流动才有商机
<8-12,Joey>It's all about turnover.

260
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,190

261
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,480
<9-3,Monica>或许瑞秋是有点没个性
<9-3,Monica>And maybe Rachel is a little bit of a pushover.

262
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,360
<9-3,Monica>但你知道我们觉得你是什么吗
<9-3,Monica>But you know what we decided you are?

269
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:26,960
<9-10,Rachel>那我没个性也无所谓
<9-10,Rachel>Yeah. And I am okay with being a pushover.

<11-4,Ross>我们再吵也吵不出结果
<11-4,Ross>You know, I don't think we're gonna settle this.

304

<11-5,Chandler>-让莫妮卡决定吧  -好
<11-5,Chandler>- Let's have Monica decide. - Yeah.

308
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:28,950
<11-12,Monica>为什么要我决定
<11-12,Monica>Why do I have to?

309
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:30,900
<11-13,Chandler>因为你才能客观公正
<11-13,Chandler>You're the only one that can be fair.

310
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,590
<11-15,Monica>我没法公正  你是我的男朋友
<11-15,Monica>I can't be fair. You're my boyfriend.

311
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:35,920
<11-16,Ross>但我是你哥哥  我们是家人
<11-16,Ross>Yeah. But I'm your brother. We're family.

312
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,960
<11-16,Ross>世上最重要的就是亲情
<11-16,Ross>That's the most important thing in the world.

313
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,760
<11-17,Chandler>不要想左右她
<11-17,Chandler>Don't try to sway her.

314
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:47,000
<11-17,Chandler>只有我能让你生小孩
<11-17,Chandler>I'm your only chance to have a baby.

315
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:52,120
<11-17,Chandler>-我们开始吧  -好的
<11-17,Chandler>- Okay, let's go. - All right.

<11-18,Ross>我们会分别说出这个笑话的由来
<11-18,Ross>Okay. We'll each tell you how we came up with the joke

317
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:00,230
<11-18,Ross>你再决定谁说的是实话  当然是我
<11-18,Ross>...then you decide which one of us is telling the truth. Me.

318
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:02,280
<11-19,Monica>-钱德勒  你先  -好
<11-19,Monica>- Chandler, you go first. - Okay.

319
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,620
<11-20,Chandler>好  我是两个月前
<11-20,Chandler>I thought of the joke two months ago

320
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,060
<11-20,Chandler>跟史提夫吃饭时想到的
<11-20,Chandler>at lunch with Steve.

321
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,480
<11-21,Monica>慢着  就是圣诞节那家伙吗
<11-21,Monica>Oh, wait, is he the guy I met at Christmas?

322
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,760
<11-22,Chandler>让我说完好吗
<11-22,Chandler>Can I finish my story?!

323
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,210
<11-23,Monica>你要我选你吗
<11-23,Monica>You want me to pick you?

324
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:14,960
<11-24,Ross>我绝对不会像那样凶你
<11-24,Ross>See, I would never snap at you like that.

325
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,120
<11-24,Ross>二个孩子
<11-24,Ross>Two babies.

326
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,320
<11-25,Monica>-请继续  -好
<11-25,Monica>- Continue. - Okay.

327
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,610
<11-26,Chandler>史提夫说他去看医生
<11-26,Chandler>So Steve said he had to go to the doctor.

328
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:29,260
<11-26,Chandler>他的医生姓侯
<11-26,Chandler>And Steve's doctor's name is Doctor Homey.

329
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,670
<11-26,Chandler>我当时问他  "是猴子医生吗"
<11-26,Chandler>So I said, "Dr. Monkey?"

330
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:34,890
<11-26,Chandler>所以才会有猴子医生这个笑话
<11-26,Chandler>And that is how the whole Dr. Monkey thing came up.

331
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,460
<11-27,Ross>你开什么玩笑
<11-27,Ross>Are you kidding?

332
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:43,920
<11-27,Ross>我是念进化论的
<11-27,Ross>Okay, look, I study evolution.

333
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,610
<11-27,Ross>记得吧  进化论
<11-27,Ross>Remember? Evolution.

334
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:47,340
<11-27,Ross>猴子进化成人
<11-27,Ross>Monkey into man.

335
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,970
<11-27,Ross>况且我是博士
<11-27,Ross>Plus, I'm a doctor. And...

336
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:52,250
<11-27,Ross>我还养过猴子
<11-27,Ross>...l had a monkey.

337
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:56,350
<11-27,Ross>我是猴子博士
<11-27,Ross>I'm Dr. Monkey!

338
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,460
<11-28,Chandler>这点我不跟你争
<11-28,Chandler>I'm not arguing with that.

339
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:03,820
<11-29,Monica>好  可以了  我决定好了
<11-29,Monica>All right, I've heard enough. I've made my decision.

340
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,100
<11-29,Monica>-好的  如何  -说吧
<11-29,Monica>- Okay, so what- - ? - Do tell.

341
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,130
<11-30,Monica>你们两个都是白痴
<11-30,Monica>You are both idiots.

342
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:10,660
<11-30,Monica>那个笑话不但不好笑
<11-30,Monica>It's not funny.

343
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,340
<11-30,Monica>还冒犯了女性
<11-30,Monica>And it's offensive to women.

344
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:14,910
<11-30,Monica>还有医生  还有猴子
<11-30,Monica>And doctors. And monkeys.

345
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:18,370
<11-30,Monica>你们不该争笑话是谁的
<11-30,Monica>You shouldn't argue over who gets credit.

346
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,800
<11-30,Monica>你们应该去争是谁
<11-30,Monica>You should argue over who gets blamed

347
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,660
<11-30,Monica>让这世界受这种罪
<11-30,Monica>for inflicting this horrible joke on the world.

348
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:25,150
<11-30,Monica>别再争了
<11-30,Monica>Now, let it go.

349
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:27,410
<11-30,Monica>那个笑话烂透了
<11-30,Monica>The joke sucks.

350
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,860
<11-32,Chandler>-那是你的笑话  -才不是
<11-32,Chandler>- lt's your joke. - lt is not.

351
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:54,100
<12-1,Monica>-钱德勒  你在这里啊  -你好
<12-1,Monica>- Oh, my God, Chandler, there you are. - Hi.

352
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,840
<12-3,Monica>是菲比和瑞秋
<12-3,Monica>Hey, it's Phoebe and Rachel.

353
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:58,250
<12-3,Monica>你要不要告诉她们
<12-3,Monica>Hey, why don't you tell them

354
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,550
<12-3,Monica>你刚才说的话
<12-3,Monica>what you were telling me earlier

355
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:01,900
<12-3,Monica>说我并不难搞
<12-3,Monica>about me not being high maintenance?

356
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:08,470
<12-4,Chandler>莫妮卡是个自信沉着的女性
<12-4,Chandler>Monica is a self- sufficient, together lady.

357
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:13,360
<12-4,Chandler>跟她在一起就像在度假
<12-4,Chandler>Being with her has been like being on a vacation.

358
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,850
<12-4,Chandler>至于所谓的难搞
<12-4,Chandler>And what may be perceived as high maintenance...

359
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:21,770
<12-4,Chandler>只是注重小细节
<12-4,Chandler>is merely attention to detail

360
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:23,070
<12-4,Chandler>和...
<12-4,Chandler>...and...

361
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,510
<12-4,Chandler>心灵的慷慨
<12-4,Chandler>generosity of spirit.

362
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:29,840
<12-5,Rachel>哇  不得不说
<12-5,Rachel>Wow. You know what?

363
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,080
<12-5,Rachel>这真是我听过最棒的假话
<12-5,Rachel>That is the best fake speech I think I've ever heard.

364
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:35,050
<12-6,Phoebe>真的  我听过更棒的
<12-6,Phoebe>Really? I've heard better.

365
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,980
<12-7,Monica>等等  那是他自己说的
<12-7,Monica>Wait, he came up with that himself.

366
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:39,170
<12-7,Monica>告诉她们  钱德勒
<12-7,Monica>Tell them, Chandler.

367
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:42,710
<12-8,Chandler>我已经词穷了  我可以复述一遍吗
<12-8,Chandler>I'm out of words. Should I just say the whole thing again?

368
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:44,880
<12-9,Monica>我一点也不难搞
<12-9,Monica>Look, I am not high maintenance!

369
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,830
<12-9,Monica>我不是  钱德勒
<12-9,Monica>I am not. Chandler!

370
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,560
<12-10,Chandler>你是有点难搞
<12-10,Chandler>You're a little high maintenance.

371
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,930
<12-11,Monica>你上我的黑名单了
<12-11,Monica>You are on my list!

372
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:57,540
<12-9,Monica>对不起  但是你并不
<12-9,Monica>Look, I'm sorry, but you're not- -

373
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:00,540
<12-10,Chandler>你并不好相处  但你很热情
<12-10,Chandler>You're not easygoing, but you're passionate.

374
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:02,040
<12-11,Monica>这样很好
<12-11,Monica>And that's good.

375
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,620
<12-12,Chandler>当你为小事不高兴时
<12-12,Chandler>And when you get upset about little things,

376
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,280
<12-12,Chandler>我会恰如其分地
<12-12,Chandler>I think that I'm pretty good at

00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,520
<12-12,Chandler>那样也很好
<12-12,Chandler>That's good too.

379
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,680
<12-12,Chandler>所以她们说你难搞也行
<12-12,Chandler>They say you're high maintenance...

380
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,320
<12-12,Chandler>但没关系  因为我喜欢...
<12-12,Chandler>...but it's okay, because I like...

381
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:18,030
<12-12,Chandler>搞定你
<12-12,Chandler>maintaining you.

382
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:27,740
<12-13,Monica>我可没叫他说这些
<12-13,Monica>I didn't even tell him to say that.

00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:34,670
<12-14,Chandler>-你从黑名单除名了  -我除名了
<12-14,Chandler>- Alright. You're off my list. - I'm off the list.

<13-2,Monica>Phoebe?

385
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,750
<12-15,Monica>你不找我当女朋友也没关系
<12-15,Monica>It's okay that you don't want me to be your girlfriend.

386
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,720
<12-15,Monica>因为我有最棒的男朋友
<12-15,Monica>I have the best boyfriend.

387
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:47,680
<12-16,Phoebe>我突然觉得你好迷人
<12-16,Phoebe>You know, suddenly I find you very attractive.

388
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,360
<12-17,Chandler>兄弟  试镜结果如何

396
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,230

<12-22,Rachel>他大白天扔下工作去办私事
<12-22,Rachel>He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand
