3
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,810
<1-3,Joey>就算我知道内幕
<1-3,Joey>Look, just because I know about you two

4
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:17,070
<1-3,Joey>也不代表我喜欢看你们亲热
<1-3,Joey>doesn't mean I like looking at it.

<1-5,Joey>如果要我假装不知道你们的事
<1-5,Joey>Okay, look, if I have to pretend to I don't know about you two...

9
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:36,720
<1-5,Joey>你们就得假装你们之间没什么
<1-5,Joey>then you two are gonna have to pretend there's nothing to know about.

<1-7,Monica>-好的  抱歉  -抱歉

33
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,340
<2-5,Phoebe>一年前我连家人都没有
<2-5,Phoebe>A year ago I didn't even have a family,

00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,090
<2-8,Phoebe>我妈为什么送我毛皮大衣
<2-8,Phoebe>Why would my mother send me a fur?

00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:22,110
<2-8,Phoebe>她完全不了解我吗
<2-8,Phoebe>Doesn't she know me but at all?

<2-8,Phoebe>我已经有了非常好的大衣
<2-8,Phoebe>Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat

42
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:29,350
<2-9,Chandler>只不过是九岁的菲律宾童工
<2-9,Chandler>Yeah, just some 9-year-old Filipino kids

43
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:32,600
<2-9,Chandler>为了时薪一毛二卖命做的
<2-9,Chandler>who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour.

00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:37,400
<2-9,Chandler>没这种事  我胡说的
<2-9,Chandler>That didn't happen, I made that up!

45
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,830
<2-11,Gunther>罗斯  你不能在这里贴广告
<2-11,Gunther>Ross, Ross, you can't put up flyers in here.

46
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:47,150
<2-12,Ross>为什么  别人都可以
<2-12,Ross>How come? Everybody else does.

47
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,870
<2-13,Gunther>你不可以
<2-13,Gunther>You can't.

48
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,010
<2-14,Monica>那是什么东西
<2-14,Monica>What is that?

49
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,080
<2-15,Ross>我要处理掉一些东西
<2-15,Ross>I'm getting rid of some things.

50
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,960
<2-16,Monica>这是你全部家当
<2-16,Monica>This is all of your things.

51
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,340
<2-17,Ross>对  没错
<2-17,Ross>Yes, it is.

52
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:07,040
<2-17,Ross>这很好  艾蜜莉说我们应该都换成新的
<2-17,Ross>It's good. Emily thinks we should get all new stuff.

53
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,860
<2-17,Ross>只属于我们的  全新的东西
<2-17,Ross>Stuff that's just ours. Together. Brand new.

54
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:10,790
<2-18,Monica>所以这是
<2-18,Monica>So basically, this is a

55
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:13,190
<2-18,Monica>"瑞秋碰过的家具"大拍卖
<2-18,Monica>getting-rid-of-everything-Rachel-ever-touched sale.

<2-20,Gunther>I'll take it all.

58
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,870
<2-21,Joey>罗斯  你不反对吗
<2-21,Joey>Ross, you're okay with that?

59
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:22,970
<2-22,Ross>只要一切顺着艾蜜莉
<2-22,Ross>Look, if I can just do what Emily wants and

60
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,970
<2-22,Ross>等她来纽约后就没事了
<2-22,Ross>get her to New York, I'm sure everything will be fine.

61
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:28,180
<2-23,Chandler>但是这么做太极端了吧
<2-23,Chandler>Okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme?

62
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,850
<2-24,Ross>想想我做过的事情  还能怪她吗
<2-24,Ross>After what I did, can you blame her?

63
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:32,650
<2-25,Phoebe>我的天  你已经算轻松了
<2-25,Phoebe>Oh my God! You got off easy!

64
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:35,610
<2-25,Phoebe>我朋友席薇的丈夫在床上喊错名字后
<2-25,Phoebe>When my friend Silvie's husband said someone else's name in bed,

65
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:38,190
<2-25,Phoebe>她诅咒他并把他的小弟弟弄成了绿色
<2-25,Phoebe>she cursed him and turned his thingy green.

66
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:47,180
<2-26,Joey>他这是做什么
<2-26,Joey>What is he doing?

67
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:51,550
<2-26,Joey>艾蜜莉觉得罗斯的家具会染上瑞秋的虱子吗
<2-26,Joey>Emily thinks Ross' furniture has got Rachel cooties?

68
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:53,720
<2-27,Monica>别激动  乔伊
<2-27,Monica>Calm down, Joey.

69
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,020
<2-28,Joey>不  事情都搞得乱七八糟了
<2-28,Joey>No! Everything's gettin' all messed up, y'know?

70
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,630
<2-28,Joey>艾蜜莉不准罗斯见瑞秋
<2-28,Joey>Emily won't let Ross see Rachel.

71
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,390
<2-28,Joey>可是我们会继续见瑞秋
<2-28,Joey>we're not gonna stop seeing Rachel,

72
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:03,260
<2-28,Joey>因此  罗斯再也不能见我们
<2-28,Joey>hence Ross stops seeing us!

73
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:05,750
<2-29,Phoebe>我讨厌这样  一切都变了
<2-29,Phoebe>I hate this. Everything's changing.

74
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,760
<2-30,Chandler>我们失去了罗斯  乔伊还会用"因此"
<2-30,Chandler>I know we're losing Ross. Joey said "hence."

75
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:16,390
<2-31,Monica>我也不高兴  但是如果罗斯能开心
<2-31,Monica>I'm not happy about this either, but if Ross says he's happy...

76
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,350
<2-31,Monica>我们就不该说出
<2-31,Monica>then we're just gonna have to keep

77
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:20,610
<2-31,Monica>自己对艾蜜莉的不满
<2-31,Monica>our feelings about Emily to ourselves.

78
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:22,220
<2-31,Monica>你同意吗
<2-31,Monica>Are you cool with that?

79
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,700
<2-31,Monica>不
<2-31,Monica>No!

80
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,710
<2-32,Joey>不过你们知道  我是演员
<2-32,Joey>But, you know, I'm an actor.

81
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:29,550
<2-32,Joey>我可以装得无所谓
<2-32,Joey>I'll act cool.

88
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:55,270
<3-4,Monica>就在杀虫剂下面
<3-4,Monica>Right underneath the can of bug bomb.

89
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,510
<3-4,Monica>看来放置厨具最好的地方
<3-4,Monica>I wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food

00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,830
<4-6,Ross>不  只是有点突然
<4-6,Ross>No, it's just a bit sudden.

100
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:41,010
<4-6,Ross>非常好  我也全力赞成

102
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,180
<4-7,Joey>怎么了  罗斯
<4-7,Joey>What's the matter, Ross?

103
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:50,780
<4-8,Ross>没事  其实
<4-8,Ross>Nothing. No, actually...

104
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:52,720
<4-8,Ross>是好消息
<4-8,Ross>...great news!

105
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,960
<4-8,Ross>我刚跟艾蜜莉通完电话
<4-8,Ross>I just got off the phone with Emily

106
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:58,250
<4-8,Ross>看来我要搬家了
<4-8,Ross>and it looks like I'm moving to a new apartment.

107
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:01,800
<4-9,Phoebe>为什么
<4-9,Phoebe>Why?

108
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:04,730
<4-10,Ross>她认为  而且我也同意
<4-10,Ross>Her thought is, and I agree...

109
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:09,230
<4-10,Ross>既然要换新家具  干脆换间公寓
<4-10,Ross>...fresh new furniture, why not a fresh new apartment?

110
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,340
<4-10,Ross>她表弟有间房子要转租
<4-10,Ross>Her cousin has a place to sublet.

111
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:14,340
<4-10,Ross>一边可以看到河  一边可以看到哥伦比亚县
<4-10,Ross>It's got a view of the river on one side and Columbia on the other.

112
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,810
<4-11,Joey>那是郊区  要转三次火车
<4-11,Joey>That's way uptown! That's three trains away...

113
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:18,450
<4-11,Joey>太棒了
<4-11,Joey>...which is great!

114
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,940
<4-11,Joey>我喜欢搭火车
<4-11,Joey>I love to ride that rail.

115
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,320
<4-12,Chandler>你真的同意吗
<4-12,Chandler>So you're really okay with this?

116
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:27,220
<4-13,Ross>是的  离上班地点是有点远
<4-13,Ross>Yes! Yes! I mean it's-it's kinda far from work,

117
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:31,630
<4-13,Ross>但是我坐车时可以做很多事
<4-13,Ross>...but I'll get so much done on the commute.

118
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,530
<4-13,Ross>她算是送了我一份大礼  那就是时间
<4-13,Ross>I've been given the gift of time.

119
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:38,660
<4-14,Chandler>有意思  上次圣诞节我得到很多空间
<4-14,Chandler>That's so funny. Last Christmas I got the gift of space.

120
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,760
<4-14,Chandler>两样加起来就有个小宇宙了
<4-14,Chandler>We should get them together and make a continuum.

121
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:48,300
<4-15,Joey>现在还要搬家
<4-15,Joey>Now he's moving?

122
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:51,410
<4-15,Joey>艾蜜莉到底想对他怎么样
<4-15,Joey>Man, what is Emily doing to him?

123
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,640
<4-15,Joey>他又不在这里
<4-15,Joey>He's not even here!

124
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,510
<4-16,Rachel>大家听我们说
<4-16,Rachel>You guys! You guys!

125
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,850
<4-17,Monica>我们刚刚去储藏室
<4-17,Monica>We were, we were just in the storage area

126
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:01,550
<4-17,Monica>看到一个很可怕的人
<4-17,Monica>and we saw this really creepy man!

127
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,990
<4-18,Rachel>眼神凶残  全身毛茸茸
<4-18,Rachel>It was this crazy-eyed, hairy beast-man.

128
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:08,560
<4-18,Rachel>就像大脚怪或是喜马拉雅山雪人
<4-18,Rachel>It was like a Big Foot or a yeti or something.

129
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,270
<4-19,Monica>他拿着斧头向我们走来
<4-19,Monica>And he came at us with an axe,

130
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,410
<4-19,Monica>瑞秋只好拿杀虫剂喷他
<4-19,Monica>so Rachel had to use a bug bomb on him!

131
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:16,040
<4-20,Rachel>我拉开拉环拼命喷他
<4-20,Rachel>I pulled the tab and I just fogged his yeti ass.

132
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,490
<4-21,Joey>-深色头发  满脸胡须  -是的
<4-21,Joey>- Like, dark hair, bushy beard? - Yeah.

00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,570
<4-23,Joey>你们喷的是丹尼
<4-23,Joey>Yeah, you fogged Danny.

134
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:28,070
<4-24,Rachel>拜托  才没有喷丹尼
<4-24,Rachel>Please! We did not fog Danny.

135
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,680
<4-24,Rachel>丹尼是谁
<4-24,Rachel>Who's Danny?

136
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,470
<4-25,Joey>丹尼刚搬到楼下
<4-25,Joey>Danny just moved in downstairs.

137
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:35,680
<4-25,Joey>他去了安第斯山四个月才刚回国
<4-25,Joey>Yeah, he just got back from like this four-month trek in the Andes.

138
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,580
<4-25,Joey>他人很好
<4-25,Joey>Nice fella.

139
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,720
<4-26,Monica>什么人很好  每次我们喷谁
<4-26,Monica>He's nice. He's nice. You know, you always...

140
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,020
<4-26,Monica>你就帮他说话
<4-26,Monica>...stick up for the people we fog.

141
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,650
<5-1,Danny>-什么事  -你好
<5-1,Danny>- Yeah? - Hi.

142
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:58,710
<5-2,Rachel>你大概不记得了  我们就是之前喷你的人
<5-2,Rachel>You might not remember us, but we're the girls that fogged you.

143
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,610
<5-3,Monica>我们很抱歉喷到你
<5-3,Monica>We're really sorry we fogged you.

144
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:03,890
<5-4,Danny>好的
<5-4,Danny>Okay.

145
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:13,630
<5-5,Rachel>我们只是要告诉你  我们不是故意的
<5-5,Rachel>Just so you know, we didn't mean to fog you.

146
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:16,160
<5-5,Rachel>我们以为你是雪人或者怪物
<5-5,Rachel>We actually thought you were like a yeti or something.

147
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,040
<5-6,Danny>好的
<5-6,Danny>Okay.

148
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:24,690
<5-7,Danny>什么事
<5-7,Danny>Yes?

149
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:26,930
<5-8,Rachel>抱歉打扰你
<5-8,Rachel>Sorry to bother you,

150
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:30,500
<5-8,Rachel>但我们无法接受你接受道歉的态度
<5-8,Rachel>but I don't think we can accept your acceptance of our apology.

151
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,220
<5-8,Rachel>听起来一点也不真心
<5-8,Rachel>It just doesn’t really seem like you mean it.

152
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:35,430
<5-10,Danny>好的
<5-10,Danny>Okay.

153
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,490
<5-11,Monica>这家伙真没礼貌
<5-11,Monica>That guy is so rude!

154
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:43,880
<5-12,Rachel>没错  他哪里有病
<5-12,Rachel>Really! What is with that guy?

155
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,790
<5-12,Rachel>换作我喷你  你早就原谅我了
<5-12,Rachel>You'd forgive me if I fogged you.

156
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,510
<5-13,Monica>其实你有喷到一点点
<5-13,Monica>You did, a little bit.

157
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:51,600
<5-14,Rachel>天啊  亲爱的  我很抱歉
<5-14,Rachel>Oh, my God, honey. I'm so sorry.

158
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,090
<5-15,Monica>-我完全不介意  -真的吗
<5-15,Monica>- I totally forgive you. - Really?

159
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,980
<6-3,Phoebe>你知道我那个开火葬场的朋友克里斯吧
<6-3,Phoebe>So listen. You know my friend Chris who owns the crematorium?

160
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,950
<6-4,Monica>火葬场克里斯  当然知道
<6-4,Monica>Crematorium Chris? Sure.

161
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,350
<6-5,Phoebe>他说他愿意免费帮我烧毛皮大衣
<6-5,Phoebe>He said he would cremate my fur coat for free...

162
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:15,760
<6-5,Phoebe>只要我介绍下个挂掉的朋友去那里火化就行
<6-5,Phoebe>...if I bring in the next person I know who dies.

163
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:20,280
<6-6,Rachel>天啊
<6-6,Rachel>Oh, my God!

164
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,420
<6-6,Rachel>天啊  好漂亮的毛皮大衣
<6-6,Rachel>Oh, my God. Look at these pelts!

165
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,970
<6-7,Monica>别太喜欢  她要烧掉
<6-7,Monica>Don't get too attached. She's having it cremated.

166
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:32,120
<6-8,Rachel>菲比  亲爱的  我知道你怪怪的
<6-8,Rachel>Uhh, Phoebe, honey, honey, I know you're quirky

167
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,470
<6-8,Rachel>大家平时也欣赏你这点
<6-8,Rachel>and I get a big kick out of it, we all do actually.

168
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:36,970
<6-8,Rachel>但是你毁掉这么棒的大衣
<6-8,Rachel>But if you destroy a coat like this...

169
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:40,340
<6-8,Rachel>实在是有违天理
<6-8,Rachel>...that is like a crime against nature.

170
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:43,010
<6-8,Rachel>说错了  是时尚不容
<6-8,Rachel>Not nature. Fashion!

171
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,880
<6-9,Phoebe>这叫做时尚
<6-9,Phoebe>This is fashion?

172
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:48,360
<6-9,Phoebe>原来对你来说  尸体就是时尚
<6-9,Phoebe>So to you, death is fashion?

173
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,630
<6-9,Phoebe>实在有意思
<6-9,Phoebe>That's really funny.

174
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,600
<6-9,Phoebe>接下来菲比
<6-9,Phoebe>Here's Phoebe...

175
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:55,030
<6-9,Phoebe>为各位展示最流行的毛茸茸尸体
<6-9,Phoebe>...sporting cutting-edge hairy carcass...

176
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:59,630
<6-9,Phoebe>这些动物死在寒冷俄罗斯的捕兽夹下
<6-9,Phoebe>...from, you know, the steel traps of wintry Russia.

177
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,900
<6-9,Phoebe>你们真认为好看吗
<6-9,Phoebe>You really think this looks good?

178
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,200
<6-9,Phoebe>因为我觉得不赖
<6-9,Phoebe>Because I do!

179
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:14,210
<7-1,Ross>我知道  我也想你  真希望快点见到你
<7-1,Ross>I know, I miss you too. I can't wait to see you.

180
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:15,940
<7-1,Ross>我爱你  再见
<7-1,Ross>I love you. Bye.

181
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,140
<7-2,Chandler>这是什么  石头吗
<7-2,Chandler>What is in here, rocks?

182
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:21,650
<7-3,Ross>不  我收集的化石样本
<7-3,Ross>No, it's my collection of fossil samples.

183
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:23,720
<7-4,Chandler>就是石头嘛
<7-4,Chandler>So, rocks.

184
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,660
<7-5,Ross>我一定会想念这里的
<7-5,Ross>I'm really gonna miss this apartment.

185
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:39,470
<7-5,Ross>小本就在那边学会走路的
<7-5,Ross>You know, Ben took his first steps right over there.

186
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,840
<7-6,Joey>记不记得我上次撞到这里
<7-6,Joey>Remember when I ran into this thing and

187
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,930
<7-6,Joey>然后昏倒了
<7-6,Joey>it kinda knocked me out a little?

188
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,150
<7-7,Ross>我很喜欢这间公寓
<7-7,Ross>I love this place.

189
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,720
<7-7,Ross>老实说  我真希望别搬家
<7-7,Ross>To tell the truth, I wish I didn't have to move.

190
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:56,090
<7-8,Joey>你的意思是  搬家让你不开心
<7-8,Joey>Are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?

191
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:59,540
<7-9,Ross>如果艾蜜莉给我选择的机会
<7-9,Ross>If Emily gave me a choice...

192
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,090
<7-10,Joey>你本来就有机会
<7-10,Joey>You do have a choice!

193
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:05,380
<7-10,Joey>罗斯  你为什么要听她的  你疯了吗
<7-10,Joey>Ross, why are you listening to her? Are you crazy?

194
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:07,040
<7-11,Ross>怎么了
<7-11,Ross>What?

195
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,160
<7-12,Joey>艾蜜莉这些要求太过分  她根本就是...
<7-12,Joey>It's not right what Emily wants you to do. She's totally...

196
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,540
<7-12,Joey>不要再掐我了
<7-12,Joey>Stop pinching me!

197
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:15,570
<7-12,Joey>你们都说只要罗斯快乐
<7-12,Joey>Look, now you guys said I only had to keep my mouth shut

198
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:18,010
<7-12,Joey>我就不该说  对吗
<7-12,Joey>as long as Ross was happy, right?

199
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:21,750
<7-12,Joey>可是他刚说他不是很开心
<7-12,Joey>He just told me that he's not entirely happy.

200
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,500
<7-13,Ross>这是怎么回事
<7-13,Ross>What's going on?

201
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,790
<7-14,Joey>我们都讨厌艾蜜莉
<7-14,Joey>We all hate Emily!

202
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,800
<7-15,Phoebe>不
<7-15,Phoebe>No!

203
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,040
<7-16,Monica>不  罗斯  我们不讨厌艾蜜莉
<7-16,Monica>No, Ross, we do not hate Emily.

204
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,560
<7-16,Monica>我们只是认为你为了讨她开心
<7-16,Monica>We just think that you're having to sacrifice...

205
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,470
<7-16,Monica>牺牲的太多
<7-16,Monica>...a whole lot to make her happy.

206
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:39,630
<7-17,Joey>没错
<7-17,Joey>Yeah.

207
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:44,160
<7-18,Chandler>大家都认为她有点不可理喻
<7-18,Chandler>We just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable.

208
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,370
<7-19,Joey>对  就是不可理喻
<7-19,Joey>Yes, unreasonable.

209
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,670
<7-19,Joey>不可理喻
<7-19,Joey>Unreasonable?

210
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:53,140
<12-12,Rachel>等你们谁结婚了  我们再讨论这个问题吧
<12-12,Rachel>How about we have this conversation when one of you guys gets married!

211
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,610
<12-13,All>你们根本不知道如何维持婚姻
<12-13,All>You have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work.

212
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:59,950
<12-14,Rachel>婚姻就是互相妥协  永远都会开心吗  不会
<12-14,Rachel>It's about compromise. Do you always like it? No.

213
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:01,350
<12-15,Ross>但是你愿意吗  愿意
<12-15,Ross>Do you do it? Yes.

214
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:04,980
<12-16,Rachel>因为婚姻不是只有欢笑  快乐  梦幻
<12-16,Rachel>Because it's not all laughing, happy, candy in the sky...

215
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:07,180
<12-17,Joey>一天到晚上咖啡馆喝咖啡
<12-17,Joey>drinking coffee at Central Perk all the time!

216
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,460
<12-18,Rachel>婚姻是现实生活  知道吗
<12-18,Rachel>It's real life, okay?

217
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:11,160
<12-18,Rachel>婚姻只适合成年人
<12-18,Rachel>It's what grownups do.

218
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,840
<8-1,Phoebe>他说得有道理
<8-1,Phoebe>I think he's right.

219
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,700
<8-1,Phoebe>你们泡咖啡馆的时间太长了
<8-1,Phoebe>You guys hang out at the coffee house way too much.

220
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,390
<9-1,Monica>-我对罗斯很抱歉  -我知道
<9-1,Monica>- I feel so guilty about Ross. - I know.

221
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:34,250
<9-3,Joey>我觉得似乎都怪我
<9-3,Joey>I kind of feel like it's my fault.

222
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,190
<9-4,Chandler>似乎
<9-4,Chandler>Kind of?

223
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:42,050
<9-4,Chandler>要不是你大嘴巴  也不会有这种下场
<9-4,Chandler>If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.

224
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:44,770
<9-5,Joey>我最近知道的秘密太多
<9-5,Joey>I'm keeping so many things to myself these days,

225
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:46,730
<9-5,Joey>总有说漏嘴的时候
<9-5,Joey>something was bound to slip out!

226
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,020
<9-6,Chandler>你说出真实想法其实很勇敢
<9-6,Chandler>I think it's very brave what you said.

227
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:56,640
<9-7,Phoebe>我坐不住了  我得去走走
<9-7,Phoebe>I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places.

228
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,460
<9-8,Chandler>菲比  你怎么还穿那件大衣
<9-8,Chandler>Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat?

229
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,390
<9-8,Chandler>你不是很关心动物的权益吗
<9-8,Chandler>How about the whole animal rights thing?

230
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,710
<9-9,Phoebe>我最近看了一些书  告诉你们
<9-9,Phoebe>I've been reading up, and for your information...

231
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:06,770
<9-9,Phoebe>貂不是好动物
<9-9,Phoebe>...minks aren't very nice.

232
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:11,740
<9-9,Phoebe>好吧  我承认  我喜欢这件大衣
<9-9,Phoebe>Okay, I admit it. I love this coat, okay?

233
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:14,530
<9-9,Phoebe>这是裹在我身上最棒的东西
<9-9,Phoebe>It's the best thing I ever had wrapped around me,

234
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:16,350
<9-9,Phoebe>菲尔·亨特利都不够好
<9-9,Phoebe>including Phil Huntley.

235
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:20,280
<9-9,Phoebe>还记得菲尔·亨特利吗  他帅呆了
<9-9,Phoebe>Remember Phil Huntley? He was fine.

236
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:31,880
<10-1,Rachel>你好

<10-3,Rachel>Yeti? Danny?

239
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,360
<10-4,Danny>我得剪头发因为
<10-4,Danny>I had to cut my hair to get rid of...

240
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,510
<10-4,Danny>杀虫剂的味道洗不掉
<10-4,Danny>...the fogger smell.

241
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,280
<10-5,Rachel>抱歉  我本来绝对不会乱喷的
<10-5,Rachel>Listen, I'm so sorry. I would have never fogged you...

242
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:58,010
<10-5,Rachel>要不是你的样子实在...
<10-5,Rachel>...if you hadn't looked so... You know...

243
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:02,250
<10-6,Danny>当然  有些人只会以貌取人
<10-6,Danny>Absolutely. Some people are just into appearances.

244
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,500
<10-7,Rachel>什么
<10-7,Rachel>What?

245
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,750

00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,090
<10-9,Rachel>等等  什么无所谓
<10-9,Rachel>No-no-no! That is not cool!

247
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:08,720
<10-9,Rachel>你根本不认识我
<10-9,Rachel>You don't even know me.

248
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:12,620
<10-10,Danny>你提着一堆购物袋  还有购物目录
<10-10,Danny>Come on, you got the shopping bags and the Sack's catalog.

249
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:16,060
<10-11,Rachel>你以为这样就能看透我吗
<10-11,Rachel>So from that you think you've got me all figured out?

250
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:17,760
<10-11,Rachel>才怪
<10-11,Rachel>Well, you don't.

251
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,270
<10-11,Rachel>搞不好我的袋子里装满给贫困儿童的玩具
<10-11,Rachel>You know, I could have toys for underprivileged kids in here.

252
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,370
<10-12,Danny>是吗
<10-12,Danny>Do you?

253
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:28,340
<10-13,Rachel>如果他们喜欢拿紧身裤当玩具的话
<10-13,Rachel>You know, if kids like to play with capri pants.

254
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:31,010
<10-21,Rachel>好的
<10-21,Rachel>Okay.

255
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:34,080
<10-22,Danny>不准你再说这话  很刺耳
<10-22,Danny>Stop saying that. I hate that!

256
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,490
<10-21,Rachel>好的
<10-21,Rachel>Okay.

257
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:49,300
<10-16,Danny>好吧  我当时是以貌取人了
<10-16,Danny>Fine. I judged you. I made a snap judgment.

258
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:51,760
<10-17,Rachel>可是你也一样  而且更糟糕
<10-17,Rachel>But you did it too, and you are worse

259
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,520
<10-17,Rachel>你只相信愚蠢的第一印象
<10-17,Rachel>because you are sticking to your stupid snap judgement!

260
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,440
<10-17,Rachel>甚至都不肯
<10-17,Rachel>You can't even open up your mind

261
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,050
<10-17,Rachel>反省自己对不对
<10-17,Rachel>for a second to see if you might be wrong!

262
00:14:58,050 --> 00:14:59,790
<10-17,Rachel>你有什么资格说别人
<10-17,Rachel>What does that say about you?

263
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,550
<10-18,Danny>对面那家披萨店好吃吗
<10-18,Danny>That pizza place across the street any good?

264
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,490
<10-19,Rachel>什么
<10-19,Rachel>What?

265
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:05,950
<10-20,Danny>我饿了  你要不要去吃披萨
<10-20,Danny>I'm hungry. You want some pizza?

266
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,540
<10-20,Danny>你还想骂人也可以继续吼
<10-20,Danny>You can keep yelling if there's more.

267
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,700
<10-21,Rachel>好的  好的
<10-21,Rachel>Okay. Okay.

268
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,210
<10-22,Danny>不准说这话  很刺耳
<10-22,Danny>Stop saying that. I hate that.

00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:19,860
<11-1,Chandler>罗斯
<11-1,Chandler>Ross.

270
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:22,950
<11-2,Phoebe>-你还在生我们的气吗  -是的
<11-2,Phoebe>- Are you still mad at us? - Yep.

271
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:25,000
<11-4,Phoebe>很好  我写了一首"很抱歉"的歌
<11-4,Phoebe>Good! We have an "I'm Sorry" song.

272
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,270
<11-5,Ross>告诉你们  我现在心情不好
<11-5,Ross>You know what? I'm not in the mood.

273

<11-6,Joey>我很难过  你的生活发生巨大改变
<11-6,Joey>I feel really bad. You're going through all this stuff...

275
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:37,240
<11-6,Joey>我却乱讲话
<11-6,Joey>...and I just acted like a jerk.

276
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:41,380
<11-8,Phoebe>-我们都很抱歉  -你说出歌词了
<11-8,Phoebe>- We are so sorry. - You're kinda stepping on the song.

277
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:46,150
<11-9,Joey>我们实在太离谱了  其实我们都是支持你的
<11-9,Joey>We were way out of line, all right? We totally support you.

278
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,420
<11-10,Monica>无论你做什么决定  我们都赞成
<11-10,Monica>Whatever you decide, whatever you do.

279
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:51,690
<11-11,Phoebe>歌词被你们说完了
<11-11,Phoebe>Now you're just taking lines out of the song.

280
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,810
<11-12,Ross>我已经够难过了
<11-12,Ross>This is hard enough, okay?

290
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:19,090
<11-16,Phoebe>这又不是用导盲犬的皮做的
<11-16,Phoebe>It's not like I'm wearing a seeing-eye dog coat!

291
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:25,340
<12-1,Joey>罗斯  我知道今天我为什么
<12-1,Joey>You know, Ross, I think I kind of understand

292
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,420
<12-1,Joey>突然爆发了
<12-1,Joey>why I lost it today.

293
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:29,420
<12-2,Ross>是吗

<12-3,Joey>...I'm an actor, right?

296
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:36,830
<12-3,Joey>所以我的情绪比较丰富
<12-3,Joey>So I got to keep my emotions right at the surface.

297
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,430
<12-3,Joey>生活中要处理的问题太多了  你懂吗
<12-3,Joey>I got a lot of balls in the air, you know?

298
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,990
<12-3,Joey>我这种人的生活实在不容易
<12-3,Joey>It's tough. Guys like me,

299
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:47,270
<12-3,Joey>到处流浪  孤孤单单
<12-3,Joey>you wander around, you're alone.

310
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:18,160

<12-14,Rachel>If Emily knew I was here having dinner with you,

311
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,270
<12-14,Rachel>她会抓狂的  你知道的
<12-14,Rachel>she'd flip out. You know it.

<12-23,Monica>This is so weird. I just realized this

325
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,780
<12-23,Monica>这可能是大家最后一次在一起玩了
<12-23,Monica>might be the last time we'll all be hanging out together.

326
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,790
<12-24,Joey>他似乎也知道了
<12-24,Joey>It's almost as if he knew.

<12-30,Joey>我不知道这里有谁
<12-30,Joey>Well, I don't know about who's here...

337
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:56,790
<12-30,Joey>不过瑞秋肯定不在
<12-30,Joey>but I can tell you for damn sure who’s not here and that's Rachel!!

338
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:02,890
<12-31,Emily>最好是这样  罗斯应该很清楚了
<12-31,Emily>I should hope not- Ross knows better than that by now-

339
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,970
<12-32,Ross>你知道吗  其实瑞秋也在
<12-32,Ross>You know what? Rachel is here.

340
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,900
<12-33,Emily>她也在
<12-33,Emily>She's there?

00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:18,780
<12-36,Emily>罗斯  切掉免提
<12-36,Emily>Ross, take me off speakerphone.

344
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:22,980
<12-37,Ross>你怎么可以这样对我
<12-37,Ross>How could you do this to me?

345
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:26,490
<12-38,Emily>我以为我已经把瑞秋的事说得够清楚了
<12-38,Emily>I thought I made my feelings about Rachel perfectly clear.

346
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:30,720
<12-39,Ross>艾蜜莉  我只是跟朋友吃饭
<12-39,Ross>Emily, I'm just having dinner with my friends, okay?

347
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,040
<12-40,Emily>很明显你就是喜欢跟她粘在一起
<12-40,Emily>You obviously can't keep away from her.

348
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,540
<12-41,Ross>艾蜜莉  你太夸张了
<12-41,Ross>Emily, that's ridiculous.

349
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,980
<12-41,Ross>我愿意为你搬家
<12-41,Ross>Look, I'm moving for you.

350
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:39,380
<12-41,Ross>愿意为你不见朋友
<12-41,Ross>I'm cutting friends out of my life for you.

351
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:43,070
<12-41,Ross>求求你赶快搭飞机来纽约  好吗
<12-41,Ross>Please, just get on the plane and come to New York, okay?

352
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:46,080
<12-41,Ross>你会知道我只想跟你在一起
<12-41,Ross>You’ll see you're the only person I want to be with.

353
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,350
<12-42,Emily>我过去之后就不会这么紧张了
<12-42,Emily>I'll feel better when I'm there,

354
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:50,810
<12-42,Emily>可以随时知道你在哪里
<12-42,Emily>and I can know where you are all the time.

355
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:56,930
<12-43,Ross>你不可能永远随时掌握我的行踪
<12-43,Ross>You can't know where I am all the time.

356
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:02,200
<12-43,Ross>如果你不信任我  我们的婚姻永远不会幸福
<12-43,Ross>This marriage will never work if you don't trust me.

357
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,710
<12-44,Emily>你说得对
<12-44,Emily>You're right.

358
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:10,030
<12-45,Ross>那么  你能相信我吗
<12-45,Ross>So, can you trust me?

359
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:16,670
<12-46,Emily>不相信
<12-46,Emily>No.

360
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,410
<13-1,Joey>好像很顺利
<13-1,Joey>I think it's going okay.

361
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,030
<13-1,Joey>他好像在微笑
<13-1,Joey>Looks like he's smiling.

362
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:27,140
<13-2,Monica>你怎么知道  你只能看到他的后脑勺
<13-2,Monica>How can you tell? You can only see the back of his head!

363
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,560
<13-2,Monica>当然看得出来
<13-2,Monica>You can totally tell!

364
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,400
<14-3,Joey>你们看
