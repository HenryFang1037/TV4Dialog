00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:06,670
<1-2,Rachel>-室友早  -早
<1-2,Rachel>- Morning, roomie.  - Hey!

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,220
<1-2,Rachel>你今天早上终于记得穿衣服了
<1-2,Rachel>You remembered to put clothes on this morning.

3
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,120
<1-3,Joey>事不过五嘛
<1-3,Joey>Fifth day's a charm.

4
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:15,650
<1-4,Rachel>乔伊  能搬回来真好
<1-4,Rachel>Oh Joey, it's so great to be back here.

5
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,690
<1-4,Rachel>你真帮了我跟艾玛一个大忙
<1-4,Rachel>You're making it so easy on me and Emma.

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,430
<1-5,Joey>你能回来也很好
<1-5,Joey>It's great having you back.

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,880
<1-5,Joey>要待多久就待多久
<1-5,Joey>Stay as long as you want.

8
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,120
<1-5,Joey>就是她什么时候才不会
<1-5,Joey>And when does she stop

9
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:24,240
<1-5,Joey>整宿的哭呢
<1-5,Joey>crying all night?

10
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:29,870
<1-6,Ross>你居然没有光着屁股
<1-6,Ross>Hey! You're not naked.

11
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:34,300
<1-6,Ross>瑞秋  你今晚什么时候回来
<1-6,Ross>Rach, when will we expect to see you tonight?

12
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,290
<1-7,Rachel>我大概六点回来吧
<1-7,Rachel>I probably be back around 6.

13
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:38,250
<1-7,Rachel>她在房间里呢  已经收拾好了
<1-7,Rachel>But she's in the bedroom, all ready to go.

14
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,990
<1-7,Rachel>可她又睡着了  所以
<1-7,Rachel>But she did fell back to sleep, so

15
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,670
<1-8,Joey>她可能因为昨晚忙着
<1-8,Joey>She's probably exhausted from

16
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,420
<1-8,Joey>制造美妙的哭声累坏了
<1-8,Joey>all that adorable screaming she did last night.

17
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:45,930
<1-9,Rachel>-再见  -再见
<1-9,Rachel>- Bye.  - Bye.

18
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:49,690
<1-10,Ross>希望艾玛没有给你带来太多麻烦
<1-10,Ross>Hey, I hope Emma isn't making it too hard on you.

19
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,260
<1-11,Joey>没  一切都很好
<1-11,Joey>No, hey, it's been great.

20
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,980
<1-12,Ross>我得跟你说  虽然瑞秋住在这
<1-12,Ross>I just want you to know that with Rachel staying here...

21
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:58,400
<1-13,Joey>但是我之前对她的感觉  已经没了
<1-13,Joey>all my feelings from before are totally over.

22
00:00:58,450 --> 00:00:59,930
<1-13,Joey>即使本来还有
<1-13,Joey>And even if they weren't

23
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:02,260
<1-13,Joey>当你看到一个女人用吸奶器
<1-13,Joey>when you walk in on a woman using a breast pump

24
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:04,150
<1-14,Ross>-是啊  效果显著  -哇
<1-14,Ross>- Yeah, that'll do it.  - Wow!

25
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,680
<1-15,Joey>那你怎样呢
<1-15,Joey>So how are you?

26
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:09,990
<1-16,Ross>-不错啊  -真的吗
<1-16,Ross>- I'm okay.  - Really?

27
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,190
<1-17,Joey>当然  要是问我  有没有希望过
<1-17,Joey>Sure. I mean, do I wish

28
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:14,410
<1-18,Ross>可以和瑞秋幸福地生活在一起
<1-18,Ross>me and Rachel living together would have worked out?

29
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,410
<1-18,Ross>当然有
<1-18,Ross>Of course. You know, I'm disappointed,

30
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:18,330
<1-18,Ross>我只是有点失望  可毕竟这又不是离婚
<1-18,Ross>but it's not like it's a divorce.

31
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:20,860
<1-19,Joey>事实上这…
<1-19,Joey>Well, actually it

32
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:22,960
<1-20,Ross>这不是离婚  这不是离婚
<1-20,Ross>It's not a divorce. It is not a divorce!

33
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:28,210
<1-20,Ross>反正我跟瑞秋  都应该过自己的新生活了
<1-20,Ross>Anyway, I think Rachel and I need to get on with our lives.

34
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,760
<1-20,Ross>或许应该开始跟其他人交往
<1-20,Ross>Maybe start seeing other people.

35
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,420
<1-21,Joey>哇  真的吗
<1-21,Joey>Wow. Really?

36
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:34,960
<1-22,Ross>当然  为何不呢
<1-22,Ross>Sure, why not?

37
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:37,160
<1-22,Ross>其实  你认不认识适合我的人
<1-22,Ross>In fact, if you know anyone that'd be good for me...?

38
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:38,790
<1-23,Joey>当然  我认识很多女生
<1-23,Joey>Sure. I know lots of girls.

39
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,390
<1-24,Ross>想到谁了  说个名字
<1-24,Ross>Any names come to mind?

40
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,830
<1-25,Joey>还要名字
<1-25,Joey>Names?

52
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,090
<2-2,Joey>我正要吃东西  你要吗
<2-2,Joey>I was about to eat. Want something?

53
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:28,590
<2-3,Phoebe>有什么
<2-3,Phoebe>What you got?

54
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:33,760
<2-4,Joey>我看看  有豆泥 胡萝卜泥…
<2-4,Joey>Okay, let's see, we got strained peas, strained carrots...

55
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:36,500
<2-4,Joey>梅子泥  还没有试过这个
<2-4,Joey>strained plums. We haven't tried that yet!

56
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:37,700
<2-4,Joey>好棒
<2-4,Joey>Goody!

57
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,560
<2-5,Phoebe>谢谢
<2-5,Phoebe>Thanks.

58
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:44,230
<2-5,Phoebe>跟瑞秋重新住一起感觉如何
<2-5,Phoebe>So how is it living with Rachel again?

59
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,100
<2-5,Phoebe>当然  除了有很多好吃的之外
<2-5,Phoebe>I mean, apart from the great food?

60
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,660
<2-6,Joey>很好  很好  只是...
<2-6,Joey>I'm fine, I'm fine. It's just....

61
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,660
<2-6,Joey>她跟罗斯之间真的是很诡异
<2-6,Joey>It's just weird what's happening with her and Ross.

62
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:54,290
<2-6,Joey>昨天他居然要我介绍女生给他
<2-6,Joey>Yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody.

63
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,990
<2-7,Phoebe>瑞秋也问我有没有男生可以介绍给她
<2-7,Phoebe>Rachel asked me if I knew anyone for her too.

64
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,220
<2-8,Joey>-他们为什么要这样呢  -不知道
<2-8,Joey>- Why are they doing this?  - I don't know.

65
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:01,870
<2-9,Phoebe>他们彼此再适合不过了  真是神经
<2-9,Phoebe>They're so perfect for each other. It's crazy.

66
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,270
<2-10,Joey>你知道什么才神经  这些罐子是怎样
<2-10,Joey>You know what's crazy?

67
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,750
<2-10,Joey>才两口就没了
<2-10,Joey>These jars. It's like two bits in here?

68
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,680
<2-11,Phoebe>真希望他们可以发现  他俩是天生一对
<2-11,Phoebe>I just wish they'd realize they should be together.

69
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:14,860
<2-12,Joey>他们又住在一起的时候
<2-12,Joey>I know, I know. When they moved in together,

70
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,560
<2-12,Joey>我以为事情就解决了
<2-12,Joey>I figured that's where things were headed.

71
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,910
<2-13,Phoebe>我知道  他们应该是一家人
<2-13,Phoebe>I know. They should be a family.

72
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,910
<2-13,Phoebe>结婚生更多的小孩
<2-13,Phoebe>They should marry and have more children.

73
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:22,480
<2-14,Joey>是啊  还该把其中一个取名叫乔伊
<2-14,Joey>Yes. And they should name one of their kids Joey.

74
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:25,560
<2-14,Joey>我或许不会有小孩
<2-14,Joey>I may not have kids.

75
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:27,470
<2-14,Joey>总是要有人帮我把我的姓传下去
<2-14,Joey>Someone's gotta carry on the family name.

76
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,890
<2-15,Phoebe>或许他们一旦开始跟别人约会
<2-15,Phoebe>You know what? Maybe once they start dating

77
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,280
<2-15,Phoebe>知道别人是怎样的
<2-15,Phoebe>and see what's out there

78
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:36,330
<2-15,Phoebe>他们就会发现彼此是多么适合
<2-15,Phoebe>they'll realize how good they are for each other.

79
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:39,010
<2-16,Joey>因为他俩真是绝配啊
<2-16,Joey>Yeah, because it is slim pickings.

80
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:42,580
<2-16,Joey>我昨晚约会的女生遭透了  讨厌
<2-16,Joey>I had this date last night. Yuck!

81
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,190
<2-16,Joey>但我们说话小声点  她还在房间里
<2-16,Joey>But we should probably keep it down, she's still in the bedroom.

82
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,680
<2-17,Phoebe>那我们该怎么办
<2-17,Phoebe>So, what are we gonna do?

83
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,880
<2-17,Phoebe>难道真要帮他们介绍别人吗
<2-17,Phoebe>Are we just gonna set them up with people?

84
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:54,890
<2-18,Joey>那只会使他们渐行渐远
<2-18,Joey>I know, that just pushes them further and further apart.

85
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:57,410
<2-19,Phoebe>我知道要怎么做了
<2-19,Phoebe>I know what we can do.

86
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,730
<2-19,Phoebe>我们帮罗斯跟瑞秋介绍糟糕的约会对象
<2-19,Phoebe>We could set Ross and Rachel up on horrible dates...

87
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:02,140
<2-19,Phoebe>可以使他们意识到彼此才是归宿
<2-19,Phoebe>so they'll realize how good they are together.

88
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,560
<2-20,Joey>-真是好计划  -没错
<2-20,Joey>- That's a great plan.  - Yeah.

89
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:06,150
<2-21,Phoebe>你知道最棒的是什么吗
<2-21,Phoebe>You know what the best part of it is?

90
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,670
<2-21,Phoebe>我终于可以用到计划笑声了
<2-21,Phoebe>I get to do my plan laugh.

91
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:17,500
<2-22,Joey>停  不要那么大声  不要吵醒那个谁
<2-22,Joey>Okay, shh! Not so loud. We don't want to wake up

92
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:34,870
<3-3,Rachel>你们今晚没事  对吗
<3-3,Rachel>Hi. You guys aren't doing anything tonight, are you?

93
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,710
<3-4,Chandler>你凭什么这么以为呢
<3-4,Chandler>See, now, why would you assume that?

94
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,710
<3-4,Chandler>就因为我们是已婚吗
<3-4,Chandler>Just because we're married?

95
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:42,240
<3-4,Chandler>我要让你知道 我们可是非常时髦又充实的
<3-4,Chandler>I mean, I will have you know that we are very hip, happening people.

96
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:44,720
<3-4,Chandler>现在  不好意思
<3-4,Chandler>Now if you'll excuse me,

97
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,440
<3-4,Chandler>我要继续读报上的讣告了
<3-4,Chandler>I have to get back to reading the obituaries.

98
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,600
<3-5,Rachel>我就是问问  因为今晚我需要人帮我带艾玛
<3-5,Rachel>I was just asking because I need someone to watch Emma tonight.

99
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:53,650
<3-6,Monica>我们当然帮你带  你要干什么去
<3-6,Monica>Sure we'll do it. What are you up to?

100
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,020
<3-7,Rachel>菲比帮我安排一个约会
<3-7,Rachel>Well, Phoebe set me up on a date.

101
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:56,740
<3-8,Monica>我的天
<3-8,Monica>Oh, my God.

102
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,410
<3-10,Rachel>怎么了  有什么不对吗
<3-10,Rachel>Why? What's the big deal?

103
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,980
<3-11,Monica>我以为你跟罗斯是...
<3-11,Monica>I figured because you and Ross are--

104
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,690
<3-12,Rachel>是怎样  一年半前上过床吗
<3-12,Rachel>What? Slept together a year and a half ago?

105
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,730
<3-12,Rachel>是啊  我已经好了
<3-12,Rachel>Yeah, I'm all set.

106
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:08,620
<3-13,Chandler>我觉得你去约会是件好事
<3-13,Chandler>I think it's great you're going on a date.

107
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,180
<3-13,Chandler>听起来很健康
<3-13,Chandler>It sounds healthy.

108
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:11,290
<3-13,Chandler>你也有你的需要
<3-13,Chandler>I mean, you have needs.

109
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,720
<3-13,Chandler>放手拥抱你的女性特质吧
<3-13,Chandler>Embrace your womanhood.

110
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:15,730
<3-14,Monica>你要找工作吗
<3-14,Monica>You want a job?

111
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,020
<3-14,Monica>少看欧普拉  多投简历去
<3-14,Monica>Turn off Oprah and send out  resume.

112
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,190
<3-15,Rachel>我大概七点带她过来好吗
<3-15,Rachel>I'll bring her by around 7, okay?

113
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:22,710
<3-16,Monica>没问题
<3-16,Monica>That's perfect.

114
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,500
<3-17,Rachel>你们会过很开心的
<3-17,Rachel>You guys are gonna have so much fun.

115
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:26,780
<3-17,Rachel>她现在正是可爱的时候
<3-17,Rachel>She's at such a cute age.

116
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:29,510
<3-17,Rachel>几件事注意一下  现在她会吃固体食物了
<3-17,Rachel>A couple things. Now that she eats solid food,

117
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,570
<3-17,Rachel>所以会按时排便
<3-17,Rachel>she poops around the clock.

118
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,270
<3-17,Rachel>还有小心你的头发  她喜欢抓着不放
<3-17,Rachel>And watch out for your hair because she likes to grab it.

119
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,720
<3-17,Rachel>她这个年龄阶段
<3-17,Rachel>She's also in this phase

120
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:37,690
<3-17,Rachel>还会在你离开房间的时候拼命尖叫  但是...
<3-17,Rachel>where if you leave the room, she screams, but....

121
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,930
<3-17,Rachel>谢啦  祝你们玩得开心
<3-17,Rachel>Thanks, you guys. Have fun.

122
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,710
<3-18,Chandler>突然间  我希望读到讣告里有自己的名字
<3-18,Chandler>Suddenly I wish I was reading my own name.

123
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:52,190
<4-2,Joey>乔伊  我好兴奋
<4-2,Joey>Joey, hey. I'm so excited.

124
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,550
<4-3,Phoebe>我给瑞秋找了一个最糟糕的男人
<4-3,Phoebe>I set Rachel up with the worst guy.

125
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,030
<4-4,Joey>好的  他怎么样
<4-4,Joey>All right. Who is he?

126
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,720
<4-5,Phoebe>是我按摩过的一个男客户  按摩时
<4-5,Phoebe>It's a guy I used to massage. By ''massage'' ...

127
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:01,190
<4-5,Phoebe>我得按住他  让他不能转身露鸟
<4-5,Phoebe>I mean hold down so he wouldn't turn over and flash me.

128
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:05,770

<4-23,Phoebe>Ross gets stood up,

154
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:15,650
<4-23,Phoebe>之后  他们会意识到对方有多么好
<4-23,Phoebe>and then they'll realize how good they have it together.

00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,590
<4-24,Joey>是的  好计划

<8-7,Rachel>我好想吃这家的鸡肉
<8-7,Rachel>I'm real excited about that chicken.

247
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:04,890
<8-8,Steve>我也不风趣
<8-8,Steve>I'm not funny, either.

248
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:08,030
<8-8,Steve>所以如果你是在想
<8-8,Steve>So if you were thinking,

00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,030
<8-8,Steve>"他长得不怎么样"
<8-8,Steve>"Well, he's not that good-looking..."

250
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,860
<8-8,Steve>"但也许他是个幽默的人"
<8-8,Steve>"but maybe we'll have some laughs,''

251
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:13,750
<8-8,Steve>那你就错了

<8-9,Rachel>等等  菲比告诉我
<8-9,Rachel>Hey, now, wait a minute, Phoebe told me

00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,330
<8-12,Rachel>真的啊  工作怎么样
<8-12,Rachel>Really? What's that like?

259
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,210
<8-13,Steve>做一个你痛恨  又赚不到钱的工作
<8-13,Steve>It's really fulfilling doing something

260
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,820
<8-13,Steve>真是非常充实啊
<8-13,Steve>you hate for no money.

<8-14,Rachel>别这样  别这样  史提夫
<8-14,Rachel>Now, come on. Come on, Steve.

<9-2,Rachel>我一定要追杀到你  然后把你给剁了
<9-2,Rachel>I'm going to hunt you down and kill you.

271

<9-3,Phoebe>嘿  瑞秋
<9-3,Phoebe>Hey, Rach!

272
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,960
<9-3,Phoebe>这真是史上最烂的约会
<9-3,Phoebe>This is the worst date ever!

273
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:47,320
<9-4,Rachel>你怎么给我介绍这么个怪胎
<9-4,Rachel>How could you set me up with this creep?

274

<9-5,Phoebe>听着  你说的可是

<9-6,Rachel>我才不管  这人简直就是个恶梦
<9-6,Rachel>I don't care. This guy is a nightmare.

277
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,380
<9-7,Phoebe>好了  他只在嗑完药的时候
<9-7,Phoebe>All right, so he gets a little crazy

278
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:56,440
<9-7,Phoebe>才有点失常
<9-7,Phoebe>when he's stoned.

279
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:00,360
<9-8,Rachel>他没嗑药
<9-8,Rachel>He's not stoned.

280
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,000
<9-9,Phoebe>他有出去抽烟吗
<9-9,Phoebe>Did he go out for a cigarette?

281
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:05,340
<9-10,Rachel>-有啊  四次  -我亲爱的甜姐儿瑞秋
<9-10,Rachel>- Yeah. Four times.  - My dear, sweet Rach.

282
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,630
<9-11,Phoebe>我们的计划奏效了
<9-11,Phoebe>Well, our plan is working.

283
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,850
<9-12,Phoebe>瑞秋现在如坐针毡
<9-12,Phoebe>Rachel's having a miserable time...

284
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:14,350
<9-12,Phoebe>而罗斯被人放了鸽子
<9-12,Phoebe>and Ross is stood up somewhere at a restaurant

285
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,260
<9-12,Phoebe>正在某家餐厅里呆坐
<9-12,Phoebe>all alone.

286
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:17,560
<9-13,Joey>他们很快就会重归于好
<9-13,Joey>Pretty soon they'll be back together.

287
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:19,490
<9-14,Phoebe>等到大家发现我们做的好事时
<9-14,Phoebe>By the time anyone's figured out what we've done,

288
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,390
<9-14,Phoebe>我们早就在阳光普照的墨西哥了
<9-14,Phoebe>we'll be in sunny Mexico.

289
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:26,220
<9-14,Phoebe>等等  这是另一个计划的结局
<9-14,Phoebe>Oh, wait, that's the end of a different plan.

290
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,580
<10-1,Monica>她睡着了  钱德勒
<10-1,Monica>She's asleep. Chandler?

291
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,580
<10-2,Monica>你在做什么呢
<10-2,Monica>What are you doing?

292
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:36,920
<10-3,Chandler>艾玛也这样做啊
<10-3,Chandler>Emma was doing it.

293
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,130
<10-4,Monica>她睡着了
<10-4,Monica>She's asleep.

294
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:43,100
<10-5,Chandler>她睡了  那就表示我们可以…

295
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,020
<10-6,Monica>是的  但是我们动作必须要快
<10-6,Monica>Yes. But we have to be fast.

296
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:46,800
<10-6,Monica>好的  我尽量
<10-6,Monica>Oh, okay, I'll try.

<10-7,Chandler>And you can't make any noise.

298
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51,130
<10-8,Monica>好啦  我尽量
<10-8,Monica>Okay, I'll try.

<10-11,Joey>卧房的门怎么关了
<10-11,Joey>Why is the bedroom door closed?

305
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:27,530
<10-12,Joey>在照顾哇哇的时候
<10-12,Joey>You can't have S-E-X

306
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:30,210
<10-12,Joey>怎么能上床啊
<10-12,Joey>when you're taking care of a B-A-B-I-E.

307
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:40,330
<11-1,Waiter>有个坏消息  那个中国人走了
<11-1,Waiter>I've got bad news. The Chinese guy left.

308
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:44,010
<11-2,Ross>命里有时终须有

00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,240
<11-2,Ross>命里无时莫强求

<11-6,Ross>你在干嘛  是要让他留下来吗
<11-6,Ross>What are you doing? Are you trying to get him to stay?

319
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:14,770
<11-6,Ross>你不能这样做
<11-6,Ross>You can't do that.

320
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:15,980
<11-7,Waiter>不要多管闲事好吗
<11-7,Waiter>Just get out of here, okay?

<11-8,Ross>很抱歉  这是怎么回事
<11-8,Ross>I'm sorry, what's going on?

322
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:22,440
<11-9,Waiter>服务生们都在打赌
<11-9,Waiter>Okay, the waiters have a little pool going.

323
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:24,140
<11-9,Waiter>赌你会等多久
<11-9,Waiter>We have a bet on how long it'll take

324
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:27,060
<11-9,Waiter>才会放弃回家去
<11-9,Waiter>before you give up and go home.

325
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:29,950
<11-9,Waiter>什么
<11-9,Waiter>What?!

326
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:34,370
<11-10,Ross>你竟然拿我的痛苦来赢钱
<11-10,Ross>You're making money off my misery?

327
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,540
<11-11,Waiter>只要你待到九点二十的话  我就赢了
<11-11,Waiter>Well, if you stay till 9:20, I am.

328
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,870
<11-12,Ross>太离谱了
<11-12,Ross>This is unbelievable.

329
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:42,090
<11-12,Ross>我一生从未被如此羞辱过
<11-12,Ross>I have never been so insulted in my life.

330
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,250
<11-12,Ross>现在  如果你帮我把蟹肉饼打包
<11-12,Ross>Now, if you'll wrap up my free crab cakes,

331
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,770
<11-12,Ross>我就马上离开

00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,400
<12-1,Monica>真是奇怪
<12-1,Monica>Well, that was weird.

333

<12-1,Monica>你倒是很大声  反而我倒是挺快的
<12-1,Monica>You were loud and I was fast.

334
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,430
<12-2,Chandler>我觉得我们这一次会成功
<12-2,Chandler>I think we may have really done it this time.

335
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:58,300
<12-3,Monica>都等不及去作验孕测试
<12-3,Monica>I wish l didn't have to wait to take a pregnancy test.

336
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:01,060
<12-4,Chandler>你可能需要再多买一些
<12-4,Chandler>You may want to get some more of those too.

337
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:05,360
<12-6,Monica>艾玛呢
<12-6,Monica>Where's Emma?

<12-7,Chandler>我跟你一起在里面滚床单呢
<12-7,Chandler>I was in there canoodling you.

<12-8,Monica>Okay. Okay. I'm sure that Rachel came home early

342
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,530

<12-10,Monica>You better hope we're pregnant...

345
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:22,220
<12-10,Monica>因为无论如何

<12-10,Monica>我们都得有个孩子还给瑞秋

<13-1,Steve>不敢相信我在你面前哭了
<13-1,Steve>I can't believe I'm crying in front of you.

348
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:33,350
<13-1,Steve>你一定觉得我很可悲
<13-1,Steve>You must think I'm so pathetic.

349

<13-2,Rachel>不  不  不  我欣赏会哭的男人
<13-2,Rachel>No, no, no, I admire a man who can cry.

<13-14,Monica>她爱死我的激情演出了
<13-14,Monica>She loves it when I'm dramatic.

364
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:26,880
<13-15,Monica>你为什么要带走她
<13-15,Monica>Why the hell did you take her?

365
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:28,710
<13-16,Joey>因为你们两个在做爱
<13-16,Joey>Because you two were having sex!

366
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:33,710
<13-17,Monica>-不  我们没有  -别对我说谎
<13-17,Monica>- No, we weren't.  - Don't you lie to me.

367
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:36,010
<13-18,Joey>我从钱德勒的头发就可以看出来
<13-18,Joey>I can tell by Chandler's hair.

368
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:38,490
<13-18,Joey>你也太懒了  就不能有一次在上面吗
<13-18,Joey>You are so lazy. Can't you get on top for once?

<13-19,Chandler>莫妮卡正在排卵
<13-19,Chandler>Monica's ovulating.

372
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,670
<13-20,Joey>艾玛就在隔壁
<13-20,Joey>It's unacceptable that you'd have sex

373
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:51,910
<13-20,Joey>你们居然在里面做爱  不能接受
<13-20,Joey>with Emma in the next room.

374
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,170
<13-20,Joey>我必须要告诉瑞秋这件事
<13-20,Joey>I'll have to tell Rachel about this.

<13-22,Monica>拜托不要  她会杀了我们的
<13-22,Monica>Please don't. She will kill us.

<13-23,Joey>我一定要  除非…
<13-23,Joey>Hey, I gotta. Unless....

377
00:18:58,510 --> 00:18:59,440
<13-24,Monica>除非怎样
<13-24,Monica>Unless what?

378
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,240
<13-25,Joey>除非你们把第一个小孩
<13-25,Joey>Unless you name

379
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:02,810
<13-25,Joey>取名叫乔伊
<13-25,Joey>your first-born child Joey.

00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:06,620
<13-26,Chandler>什么  为什么
<13-26,Chandler>What? Why?

381
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:08,110
<13-27,Joey>我可能永远都不会有小孩
<13-27,Joey>Hey, I may never have kids...

382
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,240
<13-27,Joey>总是要有人帮我延续香火
<13-27,Joey>and somebody's gotta carry on

383
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:10,160
<13-27,Joey>用我家的姓吧

00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:14,930
<13-28,Chandler>你姓崔比安尼
<13-28,Chandler>Your family name is Tribbiani.

385
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,090
<13-28,Chandler>我差点就被你骗到了
<13-28,Chandler>You almost had me.

386
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:32,760
<14-1,Rachel>听着...
<14-1,Rachel>Look...

387
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:35,690
<14-2,Steve>虽然我知道问也是白问
<14-2,Steve>I think I know the answer to this question,

388
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:36,470
<14-2,Steve>但是…
<14-2,Steve>but...

389
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:40,320
<14-2,Steve>你想要跟我做爱吗
<14-2,Steve>would you like to make love to me?

390
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,620
<14-3,Rachel>真的  真的不想
<14-3,Rachel>Really, really not.

391
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:52,130
<14-4,Steve>只不过是问问
<14-4,Steve>It's just as well.

392
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,270
<14-4,Steve>反正也起不来
<14-4,Steve>It doesn't work anyway.

393
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:05,690
<14-5,Rachel>好吧  那就这样  晚安  史提夫
<14-5,Rachel>All right, well, that's good to know. Good night, Steve.

394
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:17,860
<15-1,Ross>怎么了
<15-1,Ross>Hey, what's wrong?

395
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,700
<15-2,Rachel>我刚度过糟糕的一晚
<15-2,Rachel>I just had a rough night.

396
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,350
<15-3,Ross>要蟹肉饼吗
<15-3,Ross>Crab cake?

397
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,660
<15-5,Ross>发生什么事了
<15-5,Ross>Well, what happened?

398
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:28,650
<15-6,Rachel>跟你聊这件事真的是有点奇怪 但是…
<15-6,Rachel>This is kind of weird to talk to you about this, but--

399
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,460
<15-7,Ross>莫妮卡跟我说你去约会了
<15-7,Ross>Monica told me you had a blind date.

400
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:33,300
<15-8,Rachel>-是啊 -我也是
<15-8,Rachel>- Yeah.  - I did too.

401
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,120
<15-10,Rachel>但是如果对方没有出现
<15-10,Rachel>But is it technically a date

402
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:37,930
<15-11,Ross>那到底算不算是约会呢
<15-11,Ross>if the other person doesn't show up?

403
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:43,090
<15-12,Rachel>你是不是觉得  她看到你就走了
<15-12,Rachel>Oh, no. Do you think she walked in, saw you and left?

404
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:49,200
<15-13,Ross>大家为什么一直这样说
<15-13,Ross>Why does everyone keep saying that?

405
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,760
<15-14,Rachel>我可以让你好过点
<15-14,Rachel>If it makes you feel any better,

406
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:53,790
<15-14,Rachel>我真希望我的对象没有出现
<15-14,Rachel>I wish my date hadn't shown up.

407
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,730
<15-15,Ross>那么糟吗
<15-15,Ross>That bad?

408
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:56,960
<15-16,Rachel>他是做T恤的
<15-16,Rachel>Well, he makes T-shirts for a living...

409
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,620
<15-16,Rachel>而且他认为送这样的礼物给我是…
<15-16,Rachel>...and he thought it would be appropriate to give me...

410
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:02,900
<15-16,Rachel>很适当的
<15-16,Rachel>this.

411
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,890
<15-17,Ross>"女性身体检查官"
<15-17,Ross>''Female Body Inspector''?

413
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,920
<15-17,Ross>这是什么尺寸的
<15-17,Ross>What size is that?

414
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:14,210
<16-1,Phoebe>等等  所以他们要
<16-1,Phoebe>Now wait a minute. So they're gonna

415
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:15,800
<16-1,Phoebe>把第一个孩子取名叫乔伊
<16-1,Phoebe>name their first child Joey?

416
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:17,050
<16-3,Phoebe>那我要怎样才能
<16-3,Phoebe>How do I get them

417
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,220
<16-3,Phoebe>让他们把第二个孩子
<16-3,Phoebe>to name the next one

418
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:19,080
<16-3,Phoebe>以我的名字取名呢
<16-3,Phoebe>after me?

419
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:20,690
<16-4,Joey>很简单  你只要
<16-4,Joey>It's easy. You just walk in

420
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:21,870
<16-4,Joey>在他们做爱时走进去就行了
<16-4,Joey>on them having sex.

421
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:25,460
<16-5,Phoebe>那他们已经欠我三个菲比了
<16-5,Phoebe>Oh, so they owe me, like, three Phoebes.

422
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:29,910
<16-6,Phoebe>我的天  瞧  那是罗斯跟瑞秋
<16-6,Phoebe>Oh, my God! Look, it's Ross and Rachel!

423
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,790
<16-6,Phoebe>计划奏效了
<16-6,Phoebe>The plan is working!

424
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:34,460
<16-7,Phoebe>别再做那个计划笑声了
<16-7,Phoebe>Don't do the plan laugh.

425
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,470
<17-1,Ross>我们几个月以来的第一次约会
<17-1,Ross>The first dates we've had in months,

426
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,550
<17-1,Ross>结果却都这么惨
<17-1,Ross>and they were both such disasters.

427
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,610
<17-2,Rachel>你想啊  有点奇怪...
<17-2,Rachel>You know, it is weird...

428
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:49,030
<17-2,Rachel>菲比帮我安排一个很烂的约会
<17-2,Rachel>...that Phoebe would set me up on a date that was awful...

429
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:50,790
<17-2,Rachel>而在同一晚
<17-2,Rachel>...on the same night

430
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,430
<17-2,Rachel>乔伊帮你安排了一个
<17-2,Rachel>Joey set you up on a date

431
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,030
<17-2,Rachel>根本没有人出现的约会
<17-2,Rachel>that didn't even show.

432
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:56,510
<17-2,Rachel>等一下
<17-2,Rachel>Wait a minute.

433
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:00,670
<17-3,Ross>你不会认为这是故意的吧
<17-3,Ross>You don't think it was intentional?

434
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:03,250
<17-3,Ross>我是说  这实在太愚蠢了
<17-3,Ross>I mean, that's just stupid.

435
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,950
<17-3,Ross>我们真是天才
<17-3,Ross>We're geniuses.

<18-1,Joey>瞧瞧他们  合得不得了
<18-1,Joey>Look at them! They're really bonding.

00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:11,310
<18-2,Phoebe>再度坠入爱河了
<18-2,Phoebe>They're falling in love all over again.

438
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:14,670
<18-3,Phoebe>他们看到我们了
<18-3,Phoebe>Oh, they see us.

439
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,160
<18-3,Phoebe>他们看起来很生气
<18-3,Phoebe>Oh, they look mad.

440
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,140
<18-3,Phoebe>他们知道了
<18-3,Phoebe>They figured it out.

441
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:20,090
<18-3,Phoebe>他们过来了  快跑
<18-3,Phoebe>They're coming. Run!

00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:22,030
<18-5,Phoebe>-跑去哪  -墨西哥
<18-5,Phoebe>- Where?  - Mexico!

00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,440
<19-1,Joey>谁敢相信她们居然还没有出现
<19-1,Joey>Can you believe they're still not here?

00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:33,840
<19-2,Ross>是啊  四人约会
<19-2,Ross>I know. A double blind date

445
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:35,390
<19-2,Ross>我们竟然一起被放鸽子
<19-2,Ross>and we both get stood up.

446
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,900
<19-2,Ross>太倒霉了
<19-2,Ross>What are the chances?

447
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:40,030
<19-3,Joey>对啊  我好难过啊
<19-3,Joey>I know, I'm so bummed.

448
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:42,950
<19-3,Joey>现在可以上免费的蟹肉饼了吗
<19-3,Joey>Could we have our free crab cakes now?

449
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:47,370
<19-5,Joey>-什么  -我们被放鸽子了
<19-5,Joey>- What?  - We've been stood up.

00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:53,820
<19-6,Waiter>今晚没有人拿你们打赌
<19-6,Waiter>Nobody's betting on you tonight.

453
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:55,510
<19-6,Waiter>不过我们倒是在赌
<19-6,Waiter>Although we do have a pool going to see

454
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,940
<19-6,Waiter>看那个男的多久才会哭出来
<19-6,Waiter>how long it takes that guy to cry.
