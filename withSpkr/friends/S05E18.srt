<1-13,Ross>Well, it's not for sure but umm,

12
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,140
<1-13,Ross>我们在公园里遇到一个人
<1-13,Ross>we met this guy in the park who

13
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:34,730
<1-13,Ross>他觉得本很可爱
<1-13,Ross>thought Ben was really cute--

14
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:37,010
<1-13,Ross>这也是事实啦  总之
<1-13,Ross>y'know, which he is--so umm anyhoo,

15
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,790
<1-13,Ross>他留了张名片  要我们带本
<1-13,Ross>he uh, he gave us his card and told us to bring him down

16
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,840
<1-13,Ross>去参加广告试镜
<1-13,Ross>for this commercial he's auditioning.

17
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,890
<1-14,Joey>这个人是本地最大的广告选角导演
<1-14,Joey>This guy is like the biggest commercial casting director in town!

18
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,210
<1-14,Joey>本去公园随便散个步  就有试镜自动送上门
<1-14,Joey>Ben takes one lousy walk in the park and gets an audition!!

19
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,170
<1-14,Joey>我是说  本  真有你的
<1-14,Joey>I mean, way to go Ben!

20
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,260
<1-14,Joey>那个公园我都去烂了
<1-14,Joey>Man! I've been in that park a million times

21
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,950
<1-14,Joey>从来没人主动找我去试镜
<1-14,Joey>and no one offered me an audition.

22
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:04,870
<1-15,Ross>真的很神奇  我们只是在陪本玩荡秋干
<1-15,Ross>I know, it's crazy! We were just pushing Ben on the swings...

23
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,810
<1-16,Joey>我每次都在玩荡秋千啊
<1-16,Joey>I'm always on the swings!

24
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:10,350
<1-16,Joey>我是哪里做错了
<1-16,Joey>What am I doing wrong?!

25
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:12,780
<1-17,Chandler>荡秋千
<1-17,Chandler>That.

41
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:06,320
<2-1,Rachel>我要走了  祝我好运
<2-1,Rachel>Okay, gotta go! Wish me luck!

42
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,420
<2-2,Joey>祝你好运
<2-2,Joey>Luck!

43
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:09,010
<2-3,Chandler>瑞秋  既然现在你在拉夫·劳伦上班
<2-3,Chandler>Hey Rach, now that you're working at Ralph Lauren,

44
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,800
<2-3,Chandler>能不能帮我带几件马球衫回来
<2-3,Chandler>can you bring me back some of those polo shirts?

45
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:11,810
<2-4,Rachel>知道吗
<2-4,Rachel>Uh well, y'know what?

46
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:15,390
<2-4,Rachel>第一天上班就偷公司东西  我可能下不了手
<2-4,Rachel>I don't think if I feel comfortable stealing on my very first day...

47
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:20,090
<2-5,Chandler>不愿意慷公司之慨  有意思
<2-5,Chandler>Unwilling to steal from work, interesting.

48
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:23,510
<2-6,Monica>就算有人能拿免费的  那也非我莫属
<2-6,Monica>Besides, if anybody's gonna get free stuff, it's gonna be me.

49
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,880
<2-7,Rachel>好了  各位  祝我好运吧
<2-7,Rachel>Okay guys, way to wish me luck!

00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,330
<2-8,All>祝你好运  给他们瞧瞧厉害
<2-8,All>Good luck! Go get 'em!

51
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:30,970
<2-9,Phoebe>好了  来讨论下帮瑞秋庆生的事
<2-9,Phoebe>Okay, let's discuss Rachel's birthday.

52
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,450
<2-9,Phoebe>我建议在周末办惊喜派对
<2-9,Phoebe>I say we throw a surprise party this weekend.

53
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,890
<2-10,Joey>可是一个月后才是她生日啊
<2-10,Joey>Whoa-whoa, but her birthday isn't like for another month.

54
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,010
<2-11,Phoebe>是没错  但在生日当天开派对
<2-11,Phoebe>Yeah but if we throw her a party on her birthday,

55
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,380
<2-11,Phoebe>那就不惊喜啦
<2-11,Phoebe>then it's not a surprise.

56
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,230
<2-12,Monica>好主意
<2-12,Monica>I think it's a great idea.

57
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,940
<2-12,Monica>我们办个晚宴  只邀请好朋友过来
<2-12,Monica>Yeah, we could have a dinner party and just invite her close friends.

58
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:47,620
<2-13,Joey>罗斯  我们要帮瑞秋办惊喜派对
<2-13,Joey>Ross!! We're having a surprise party for Rachel!!

59
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:48,680
<2-14,Ross>好
<2-14,Ross>Okay!!

60
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:49,420
<2-15,Joey>搞定
<2-15,Joey>Done.

61
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,900
<2-16,Phoebe>好的  你想我们合办吗
<2-16,Phoebe>Okay, great so do you want to do it together?

62
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,330
<2-17,Monica>乐意之至
<2-17,Monica>I would love to do it together!

63
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,210
<2-18,Joey>她们要一起办哦
<2-18,Joey>They're gonna do it together.

64
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,000
<2-19,Chandler>兄弟  这位可是我女朋友
<2-19,Chandler>Dude! That's my girlfriend!

65
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,680
<2-20,Joey>所以我就得闭嘴吗
<2-20,Joey>What, so I gotta shut it down now?

66
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,910
<2-21,Ross>好了  我得走了
<2-21,Ross>All right, I gotta take off.

67
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,850
<2-21,Ross>我要接本去参加大试镜
<2-21,Ross>I'm picking up Ben then we're off to the big audition.

68
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,930
<2-22,Monica>看到有演员假装是本的父亲
<2-22,Monica>It's gonna be weird to watch some actor

69
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,340
<2-22,Monica>那种感觉一定很怪
<2-22,Monica>pretending to be Ben's dad.

70
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:16,930
<2-23,Ross>是啊
<2-23,Ross>Yeah.

71
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,820
<2-24,Chandler>怪过看他的两个妈妈亲热吗
<2-24,Chandler>Weirder than seeing his two moms make out?

72
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:23,710
<2-25,Joey>爸爸  广告里面有爸爸吗
<2-25,Joey>Whoa-whoa dad? There's a dad in the commercial?

73
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,710
<2-26,Ross>是啊  本和爸爸喝汤  演得很陶醉的样子
<2-26,Ross>Yeah the dad and Ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it.

74
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,430
<2-27,Joey>或许我可以跟你们一起去
<2-27,Joey>Whoa, hey, maybe I'll go down there with ya

75
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,230
<2-27,Joey>搞不好能试镜演那个爸爸
<2-27,Joey>and see if I can get an audition to play the dad.

76
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,990
<2-27,Joey>扮演本的爸爸  自然是我这教父最适合了
<2-27,Joey>I mean who better to play Ben's father than his godfather.

77
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,120
<2-28,Ross>你不是本的教父
<2-28,Ross>You're not his godfather.

78
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:34,830
<2-28,Ross>什么
<2-28,Ross>What?!

79
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,710
<2-29,Joey>你在开玩笑吗
<2-29,Joey>Are you kidding?!

80
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:41,870
<2-30,Ross>当然是啊
<2-30,Ross>Of course I am!

81
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,160
<2-30,Ross>我们走吧  教父
<2-30,Ross>Okay, let's go godfather.

82
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:46,250
<2-31,Joey>好的
<2-31,Joey>All right!

83
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,690
<3-1,Joey>我获选了  他们让我试镜
<3-1,Joey>Hey! I'm in, they're gonna let me audition!

84
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,050
<3-2,Ross>真的  太棒了
<3-2,Ross>Really? That's great!

85
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,700
<3-3,Joey>就是  选角导演中有个女的
<3-3,Joey>I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies

86
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,390
<3-3,Joey>看过我的演出  所以我离她离得远远的
<3-3,Joey>has actually seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her...

87
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,910
<3-4,Carol>那个孩子看起来很眼熟
<3-4,Carol>Hey, that kid looks familiar.

88
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,420
<3-5,Joey>是啊  他拍过一堆广告
<3-5,Joey>Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials.

89
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,950
<3-5,Joey>有麦片广告  游戏机广告
<3-5,Joey>I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks, Playstation,

90
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,730
<3-5,Joey>还帮电话公司拍过广告
<3-5,Joey>and that one for the phone company.

91
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:13,940
<3-5,Joey>他演得实在是太好了
<3-5,Joey>In fact he was so good in that one,

92
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:16,090
<3-5,Joey>我索性跟着换了电话公司
<3-5,Joey>he actually convinced me to switch phone companies.

93
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,230
<3-5,Joey>钱德勒因此还气得半死
<3-5,Joey>Chandler was mad....

94
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:22,100
<3-6,Ross>不过他这次休想拿到这角色
<3-6,Ross>Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one.

95
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:24,090
<3-6,Ross>因为本比他可爱多了
<3-6,Ross>Ben is way cuter than that kid.

96
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,750
<3-6,Ross>看就知道  看看你
<3-6,Ross>I mean look at him, look at you,

97
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,670
<3-6,Ross>很好
<3-6,Ross>That's great.

98
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,360
<3-7,Joey>如果我能演本的爸爸是不是很棒
<3-7,Joey>Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad?

99
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:38,340
<3-8,Ross>乔伊  你跟本一点都不像
<3-8,Ross>Joey, you look nothing like Ben.

100
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,180
<3-9,Joey>比你跟他像多了
<3-9,Joey>I look more like him than you do!

101
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:46,930
<3-10,Carol>我跟你还没熟到那个程度
<3-10,Carol>Y'know, I don't really know you well enough for you to do that.

102
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,690
<4-1,Kim>现在是最后的二选一
<4-1,Kim>So it's down to these two,

103
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:58,140
<4-1,Kim>南茜  我知道你喜欢这一个  我也喜欢
<4-1,Kim>Nancy I know you like this one and I think I agree.

104
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,330
<4-1,Kim>瑞秋  你觉得呢
<4-1,Kim>Rachel, what do you think?

105
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:02,240
<4-2,Rachel>那个是很漂亮
<4-2,Rachel>Well umm, that one is pretty but uh,

106
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:05,590
<4-2,Rachel>但我超爱这个的质料  抱歉了
<4-2,Rachel>I just, I just love this fabric  Sorry.

107
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,690
<4-3,Kim>不用抱歉  提供意见是你的职责
<4-3,Kim>Oh don't be sorry, that's part of your job here to give your opinions

108
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,860
<4-3,Kim>功劳归我  开玩笑的
<4-3,Kim>and then I take credit for them--I'm kidding.

109
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:15,240
<4-4,Nancy>她是在开玩笑  但下次可别跟她唱反调了
<4-4,Nancy>She is kidding, but don't ever disagree with her again.

110
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:16,660
<4-4,Nancy>这次换我开玩笑了
<4-4,Nancy>Okay, now I'm kidding!

111
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:19,380
<4-5,Rachel>这个办公室真有趣
<4-5,Rachel>Oh, what a fun office.

112
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,150
<4-6,Kim>我不知道要选哪一个
<4-6,Kim>I don't know which one,

113
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,760
<4-6,Kim>不过先来根烟倒是真的
<4-6,Kim>but I do know I need a cigarette.

114
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:26,770
<4-6,Kim>不如我们出去休息一下
<4-6,Kim>So what do you say we take a break, we go outside,

115
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,810
<4-6,Kim>等回来之后再解决
<4-6,Kim>and we'll figure this out when we come back?

116
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:33,420
<4-7,Kim>瑞秋  你抽烟吗
<4-7,Kim>Rachel? Do you smoke?

117
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,310
<4-8,Rachel>不抽  我爸是医生
<4-8,Rachel>Oh no, my dad's a doctor

118
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,700
<4-8,Rachel>老跟我说些恐怖的故事
<4-8,Rachel>and he would always tell me just horror stories......

119
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,830
<4-8,Rachel>说那些妖魔鬼怪
<4-8,Rachel>about ghosts and goblins

120
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,420
<4-8,Rachel>完全赞同公主抽烟
<4-8,Rachel>who totally supported the princess's right to smoke.

121
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,020
<5-1,Rachel>她们在抽烟的时候
<5-1,Rachel>...and then they came back from smoking

122
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:59,830
<5-1,Rachel>就背着我做出了决定
<5-1,Rachel>and they had made all of the decisions without me!

123
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,900
<5-2,Monica>这样太不公平了
<5-2,Monica>That doesn't seem fair.

124
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,500
<5-3,Rachel>就是  好像我被惩罚了
<5-3,Rachel>I know! It's like I'm being punished

125
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:05,280
<5-3,Rachel>就因为我没有恶心又伤身的抽烟习惯
<5-3,Rachel>for not having this disgusting, poisoning habit!

126
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,910
<5-4,Chandler>对  抽烟最棒了
<5-4,Chandler>Yeah, it is the best.

127
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,170
<5-5,Rachel>万一这种事没完没了怎么办
<5-5,Rachel>I mean what if this keeps happening?

128
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:13,160
<5-5,Rachel>她们在外头抽烟做决定
<5-5,Rachel>Y'know, they'll-they'll be outside smoking, making all the decisions

129
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:16,740
<5-5,Rachel>我只能在办公室里呼吸愚蠢的新鲜空气
<5-5,Rachel>and I'll just be up in my office breathing my stupid clean air,

130
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,060
<5-5,Rachel>等到了哪天
<5-5,Rachel>y'know? And then when the day comes

131
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:20,220
<5-5,Rachel>金姆要选人升职时
<5-5,Rachel>when Kim wants to promote one of us,

132
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:23,540
<5-5,Rachel>她会选谁  我还是乌烟瘴气的抽烟女
<5-5,Rachel>who do you think she's gonna pick? Me or Smokey Smokerson?

133

<5-36,Joey>Yeah, I had to teach Ross my bit

176
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:19,790
<5-36,Joey>因为我没有过关

<6-2,Rachel>我就想来这里  呼吸下新鲜空气
<6-2,Rachel>so I just thought I would come out here and get some fresh air.

182
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:44,330

195
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,130
<6-12,Nancy>我还以为你不抽烟呢
<6-12,Nancy>I thought you didn't smoke.

196
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:15,500
<6-13,Rachel>我以为你们是说大麻烟
<6-13,Rachel>Oh, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes,

197
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,890
<6-13,Rachel>毒品那种
<6-13,Rachel>Y'know what I mean, like dubbies?

198
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,430
<6-13,Rachel>我还纳闷
<6-13,Rachel>And I actually, I thought to myself,

199
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,490
<6-13,Rachel>她们是疯了不成
<6-13,Rachel>"Wow, those guys are crazy!"

200
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,050
<6-13,Rachel>这种正常烟  我自己天天都抽
<6-13,Rachel>But no, I actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time.

201
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,190
<6-14,Kim>我们很嗨
<6-14,Kim>We get high.

202
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,900
<6-15,Rachel>我也是

203
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,760
<6-16,Kim>开玩笑的

204
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,180
<6-15,Rachel>我也是
<6-15,Rachel>Oh, me too.

205
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,200
<7-1,Ross>老天  这真是折磨人
<7-1,Ross>Oh God, this is so nerve wracking!

206
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,250
<7-1,Ross>你是怎么习惯的
<7-1,Ross>How-how do you do this?

207
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,290
<7-2,Joey>遗憾的是  我得到的复试机会不多
<7-2,Joey>Well, unfortunately, I don't get many callbacks so...

208
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:50,260
<7-3,Carol>我们在试镜之后被留下来
<7-3,Carol>Is it a good sign that they asked us

209
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:52,020
<7-3,Carol>这是好现象吗
<7-3,Carol>to hang around after the audition?

210
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:52,970
<7-4,Joey>天知道
<7-4,Joey>Who knows?

211
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:58,000
<7-5,The Casting Director>最后入围的是
<7-5,The Casting Director>Okay uh, we have narrowed it down

212
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:01,600
<7-5,The Casting Director>雷蒙  本  凯尔和乔伊
<7-5,The Casting Director>to Raymond, Ben, Kyle, and Joey.

213
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:03,390
<7-5,The Casting Director>其余的人  辛苦了谢谢
<7-5,The Casting Director>The rest of you, thank you very much.

214
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,100
<7-6,Ross>好耶  我就知道

215
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,690
<7-6,Ross>拜拜

00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,660
<7-6,Ross>回见了
<7-6,Ross>Later!

218
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:18,160
<7-7,Joey>太棒了  我有可能饰演本的爸爸
<7-7,Joey>Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben's dad!

219
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:20,540
<7-9,The Casting Director>事实上那是不可能的
<7-9,The Casting Director>Actually, that can't happen.

220
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:22,600
<7-9,The Casting Director>因为你们长得太不像了
<7-9,The Casting Director>Yeah because you all have such different looks,

221
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:25,390
<7-9,The Casting Director>所以你和雷蒙一组  凯尔和本是一组
<7-9,The Casting Director>we're putting you with Raymond and Kyle with Ben.

222
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,950
<7-9,The Casting Director>最后是两组二选一
<7-9,The Casting Director>So it'll be either you two  or you two.

223
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:34,430
<7-10,Joey>要命  这样就有点尴尬了
<7-10,Joey>Man, this is gonna be kinda weird.

224
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,830
<7-11,Ross>真的是
<7-11,Ross>Yeah, it is.

225
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:38,040
<7-12,Kyle>对  一定会很尴尬
<7-12,Kyle>Yeah. It's gonna be weird.

226
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:42,690
<7-13,Ross>因为我们是最好的朋友
<7-13,Ross>No, we-we're gonna be like best friends,

227
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,320
<7-13,Ross>所以才会尴尬
<7-13,Ross>that's why it's gonna be weird.

228
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:47,760
<7-14,Kyle>原来如此  我只是答腔而已
<7-14,Kyle>Oh, oh, I thought we were just talking.

229
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,940
<8-3,Phoebe>瑞秋生日派对前  这些东西放这里好吗
<8-3,Phoebe>Is it okay if I leave this stuff here 'til Rachel's birthday party?

230
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:01,310
<8-4,Chandler>当然可以  里头是什么
<8-4,Chandler>Ah sure. What's in 'em?

231
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,420
<8-5,Phoebe>杯子
<8-5,Phoebe>Umm, cups.

232
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:06,770
<8-6,Chandler>很好  因为我们替瑞秋准备了八百加仑的水
<8-6,Chandler>Oh good, because uh we got Rachel 800 gallons of water.

233
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:10,010
<8-7,Ross>老实说  这些杯子还真不少
<8-7,Ross>Seriously that's a lot of cups.

234
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:12,830
<8-8,Phoebe>对  这是因为我负责杯子和冰块
<8-8,Phoebe>Yeah well, that's 'cause I'm in charge of cups and ice,

235
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,570
<8-8,Phoebe>莫妮卡一定会后悔莫及
<8-8,Phoebe>and Monica is gonna rue the day

236
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:17,030
<8-8,Phoebe>她要我负责杯子和冰块
<8-8,Phoebe>that she put me in charge of cups and ice.

237
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,640
<8-9,Chandler>我也后悔过一次  除了后悔没做别的
<8-9,Chandler>Y'know I rued the day once...didn't get a whole lot else done.

238
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,740
<8-10,Phoebe>好吧  该把其它杯子搬上来了
<8-10,Phoebe>Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups.

239
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,300
<8-11,Joey>-乔伊  -菲比
<8-11,Joey>- Hi, Joey. - Hey, Pheebs.

240
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:34,160
<8-12,Ross>罗斯  你在这里正好
<8-12,Ross>Ross good, I'm uh glad you're here.

241
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:35,750
<8-13,Joey>我有事要跟你说
<8-13,Joey>I wanna talk to you about something.

242
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:37,690
<8-14,Ross>怎么了
<8-14,Ross>What's up?

243
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:41,020
<8-15,Joey>我一直在想这次拍广告的事
<8-15,Joey>Well, I've been thinking about this whole commercial thing,

244
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:44,650
<8-15,Joey>我和本要硬碰硬  互相竞争
<8-15,Joey>y'know me going up against Ben, the two of us competing,

245
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,520
<8-15,Joey>这样不会有好结果
<8-15,Joey>and that can't lead to anything good.

246
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:50,160
<8-15,Joey>我想我还是退出好了
<8-15,Joey>So, I think I'm just gonna step aside.

247
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,480
<8-15,Joey>告诉他们我不去试镜了
<8-15,Joey>I'm gonna tell them that I won't audition.

248
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:57,990
<8-16,Ross>乔伊  太好了  多谢
<8-16,Ross>Wow, uh, Joey that's-that's great. Thanks man.

249
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:06,700
<8-17,Joey>就这样  你真要让我这样做吗
<8-17,Joey>That's it? You're-you're gonna let me do this?!

250
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,090
<8-17,Joey>这可是事关我的职业生涯
<8-17,Joey>This-this is my career we're talking about here!

00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:10,640
<8-18,Ross>可是你刚...

252
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:13,550
<8-19,Joey>我是要套你说出让本退出
<8-19,Joey>I just said that so you wouldn't let Ben do it!

253
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,830
<8-19,Joey>罗斯  如果真有人要退出  那也应该是本
<8-19,Joey>Look Ross, if anyone should step aside it should be Ben!

254
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,410
<8-20,Ross>什么
<8-20,Ross>What?!

255

258
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,090
<8-23,Ross>本为什么应该退出
<8-23,Ross>Why should Ben step aside?

259
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:35,340
<8-23,Ross>这原本就是他的试镜
<8-23,Ross>It was his audition in the first place!

260
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:39,530
<8-23,Ross>你是跟过去的  就像是跟班老爹
<8-23,Ross>You-you just tagged along! You're like the uh, tag-a-long dad.

261
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,320
<8-24,Joey>起码我有顾虑到本的感受
<8-24,Joey>At least I care about his feelings!

262
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:42,590
<8-25,Ross>什么
<8-25,Ross>What?!

263
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,900
<8-26,Joey>你知道万一他没通过试镜  会有多难过吗
<8-26,Joey>Do you know how hard this is gonna be on him when he doesn't get it?

264
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,240
<8-27,Ross>那他又为什么不会通过呢
<8-27,Ross>And why wouldn't he get it?

265
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:50,130
<8-27,Ross>得了吧
<8-27,Ross>Oh, come on!

282
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:36,830
<9-6,Rachel>因为那里的人全都在抽烟
<9-6,Rachel>Well-well that's 'cause I went down there and they were all smoking.

283
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,490
<9-6,Rachel>这其实是成功的味道
<9-6,Rachel>This is actually the smell of success.

284
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,780
<9-7,Chandler>不过有点怪怪的

00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,900
<12-4,Kim>完全没用
<12-4,Kim>Yeah. That didn't work out.

369
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:15,370
<12-5,Nancy>瑞秋  我们有试着戒烟  但实在是太难了
<12-5,Nancy>Rachel we tried to quit, but it was too hard!

370

<12-6,Rachel>你们开始抽烟
<12-6,Rachel>Well y'know if you, if you started smoking again

<12-7,Kim>Don't you give up!

375
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:23,680
<12-7,Kim>所以我们才没跟你说
<12-7,Kim>That's why we didn't tell you

376
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,630
<12-7,Kim>我们不想拖你下水
<12-7,Kim>and we're not gonna drag you down with us.

00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:28,120
<12-8,Rachel>等等  别这样  拖我下水吧
<12-8,Rachel>Oh wait, no-no-no! Drag me down. Drag-drag me down.

381
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:34,780
<12-9,Kim>若被我发现你抽烟  我一定炒你鱿鱼
<12-9,Kim>In fact, if I catch you with a cigarette, you're fired.

382
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:35,670
<12-9,Kim>走吧  离开这里
<12-9,Kim>So go on, get out of here!

00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,260
<13-16,Rachel>真是怪怪的
<13-16,Rachel>This is so weird.

409
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,930
<13-17,Phoebe>杯子是我负责的
<13-17,Phoebe>I was in charge of cups.

410
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:11,480
<13-18,Rachel>那就没那么怪了
<13-18,Rachel>Oh, okay, not so weird.

411
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:20,640
<14-3,Ross>我很遗憾你试镜不顺利
<14-3,Ross>Listen man, uh, I'm sorry the audition didn't go so well.

412
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:22,590
<14-4,Joey>是哦
<14-4,Joey>Yeah right!

413
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,780
<14-5,Ross>乔伊  我是真的很遗憾
<14-5,Ross>No really, I-I am Joey! I feel bad!

414
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:29,390
<14-6,Joey>罗斯  你用不着遗憾
<14-6,Joey>Yeah? Well look Ross, you don't have to. Okay?

415
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,250
<14-6,Joey>是我自己差劲  怨不得你
<14-6,Joey>It's not your fault I suck.

416
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:34,590
<14-6,Joey>连"面汤"都说不好还算哪门子的演员
<14-6,Joey>I mean what kind of an actor can't even say, "Hmm, noodle soup."

417
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,420
<14-6,Joey>你知道吗
<14-6,Joey>Yeah y'know what?

418
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:43,920
<14-7,Ross>或许你搞砸了试镜  不是因为你差劲
<14-7,Ross>Maybe-maybe you didn't mess up your audition because you suck,

419
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:47,330
<14-7,Ross>或许你搞砸了试镜
<14-7,Ross>maybe you messed up because you care

420
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:50,400
<14-7,Ross>是因为你更在意你的教子
<14-7,Ross>more about uh, your godson.

421
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,660
<14-8,Joey>什么意思
<14-8,Joey>What you do mean?

422
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,530
<14-9,Ross>我认为  在潜意识里
<14-9,Ross>I think, sub-consciously...

423
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:54,980
<14-10,Joey>等等  我听不懂
<14-10,Joey>Wait-whoa-whoa, you lost me.

424
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,430
<14-11,Ross>我觉得在某种程度上
<14-11,Ross>I think on some level,

425
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:05,600
<14-11,Ross>你搞砸了自己的试镜
<14-11,Ross>you-you sabotaged your own audition

426
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:07,920
<14-11,Ross>好让本拿到那个角色
<14-11,Ross>so that Ben would get the part.

427
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:12,860
<14-12,Joey>你的说法比我的好多了
<14-12,Joey>Well, you're way sounds a lot better than mine.

428
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:18,820
<14-12,Joey>-对  不是我演技烂  -不是
<14-12,Joey>- Yeah. Yeah! It's not that I'm a bad actor... - No!

429
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:22,840
<14-14,Joey>只是我  太在意小本了
<14-14,Joey>No, it's just ah, I care so damn much about little Ben

430
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:26,590
<14-14,Joey>看到他成功对我来说更重要
<14-14,Joey>that uh, it was more important to see him succeed.

431
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,460
<14-15,Ross>就是这样  谢谢你
<14-15,Ross>There you go. Thank you!

432
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:30,910
<14-16,Joey>-谢谢你  那他拿到角色没  -没有
<14-16,Joey>- Thank you! So, did-did he get it? - No.

433
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:32,230
<14-16,Joey>你又能怎么样
<14-16,Joey>Eh, what are you gonna do?

434
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:41,310

440
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:52,490
<15-4,Kim>他担心一个人出差
<15-4,Kim>and he wondered if one person would be enough

441
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:53,970
