<4-20,Ross>My life is an embarrassment.

132
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:18,290
<4-20,Ross>我应该去住在别人的楼梯底下
<4-20,Ross>l should  just go live under somebody's stairs.

133
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,130
<4-21,Phoebe>罗斯  根本没那么严重
<4-21,Phoebe>Ross, it's not that big a deal!

134
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,230
<4-21,Phoebe>离婚三次又怎样
<4-21,Phoebe>So you'll been divorced three times,

135
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:25,340
<4-21,Phoebe>你还是一样能有生活  会去约会...
<4-21,Phoebe>you'll still have a life, you'll go on dates--

136
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,790
<4-21,Phoebe>才不会
<4-21,Phoebe>No, no, l won't.

137
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:29,830
<4-22,Ross>我的约会指数降到谷底
<4-22,Ross>l'll be at the bottom of the dating barrel now.

138
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:32,810
<4-22,Ross>比我低的只有离婚四次的人
<4-22,Ross>The only guys below me will be Four-Divorce Guy...

139
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,080
<4-22,Ross>杀人犯和...
<4-22,Ross>...Murderer Guy...

140
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:36,640
<4-22,Ross>地质学家
<4-22,Ross>...and geologists.

141
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:40,450
<4-23,Phoebe>罗斯  你别傻了
<4-23,Phoebe>Ross, you're being ridiculous. Okay?

142
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:42,520
<4-23,Phoebe>你可爱聪明又体帖
<4-23,Phoebe>You are cute and smart and sweet.

143
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,720
<4-23,Phoebe>这比离婚三次重要多了
<4-23,Phoebe>And that is much more important than three stupid divorces.

144
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,220
<4-23,Phoebe>是吗
<4-23,Phoebe>Oh, yeah?

00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,960
<4-24,Ross>你交过离婚三次的男朋友吗
<4-24,Ross>Have you dated anyone who's been divorced three times?

146
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,660
<4-25,Phoebe>这样问不公平
<4-25,Phoebe>That's not really fair, you know?

147
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,430
<4-25,Phoebe>离过三次婚的人  通常都六十岁了
<4-25,Phoebe>Most guys that have been divorced three times are like 60.

148
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:57,260
<4-25,Phoebe>罗斯  只有你自己在意
<4-25,Phoebe>Ross, nobody cares about this except you.

149
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:00,790
<4-25,Phoebe>什么没面子都是你在想像
<4-25,Phoebe>This embarrassment thing is all in your head.

<5-2,Ross>And if you wait right here,  l'll go get Ross.

154
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,200
<5-2,Ross>我还以为你是瑞秋
<5-2,Ross>Thought you were Rachel.

155
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,000
<6-1,Chandler>我哪里露出破绽了

<6-10,Rachel>你以为自己终于受重视了
<6-10,Rachel>Y'know, you think you're finally making progress at work

167
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,550
<6-10,Rachel>结果老板却叫你瑞蔻儿
<6-10,Rachel>then your boss calls you Racquel.

168
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:52,650
<6-11,Chandler>我进公司前四年
<6-11,Chandler>Hey listen, for the first four years of my work

172
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,890
<6-12,Rachel>当然不会有人纠正她
<6-12,Rachel>so of course no one else wants to correct her,

173
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:10,810
<6-12,Rachel>于是大家都叫我瑞蔻儿
<6-12,Rachel>so everyone else is calling me Raquel!

<6-12,Rachel>到了下班前

<7-9,Phoebe>lt's just that he's obviously still in love with this Rachel girl.

<7-9,Phoebe>She said, "He's obviously still  in love with this Rachel girl."

223
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,250
<7-10,Ross>这话太扯了

230
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,610
<7-12,Ross>喝那么多我连乔伊都会娶
<7-12,Ross>l would've married Joey with that amount of alcohol.

231
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,270
<7-13,Phoebe>你能娶到乔伊已经算很好了
<7-13,Phoebe>You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani!

<7-14,Ross>很抱歉  但是你们错了
<7-14,Ross>l'm sorry, but you guys are wrong.

234
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,920
<7-15,Phoebe>没错  他以此为藉口
<7-15,Phoebe>Yes, and now he's using this three divorces reason

235
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,140
<7-15,Phoebe>说自己不想离婚  其实因为他爱她
<7-15,Phoebe>because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her.

236
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:12,090
<7-15,Phoebe>我必须说  梅格  干得好

242
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,670
<7-16,Ross>因为我一点也不爱她

00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,810
<7-16,Ross>一点也不爱

328
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:09,700
<10-15,Russell>你们当时神智不清

330
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:15,090
<10-17,Russell>你和瑞秋得向法官说明
<10-17,Russell>And we'll need you and Rachel  to testify before a judge.

331
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,790
<10-18,Ross>不能不找她吗
<10-18,Ross>There's no way to do this without her?

332
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:25,130
<10-18,Ross>我已经告诉她事情都办妥了

335
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,850
<10-19,Russell>才能办理注销

336
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,580
<10-20,Ross>那找一个长得像瑞秋的人呢
<10-20,Ross>What about someone  who looks like Rachel?

00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,150
<10-20,Ross>我会考虑接受治疗
<10-20,Ross>l will think about the therapy.

338
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:54,200
<11-2,Monica>我想我们应该开始分东西了
<11-2,Monica>So l was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff.

339
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,270
<11-3,Rachel>好
<11-3,Rachel>Okay.

341
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:02,430
<11-4,Monica>我是说你搬走我们分开的事
<11-4,Monica>Dragging out the long process of you moving out...

<11-6,Monica>这个呢  这个要归谁
<11-6,Monica>What about this? Who gets this?

345
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:18,380
<11-6,Monica>我不知道我想不想要  它有太多回忆
<11-6,Monica>l don't know if l want it because  it might be too many memories.

346
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:21,580
<11-7,Rachel>-那是什么啊  -我不知道
<11-7,Rachel>- What the hell is that?  - l don't know.

347
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:28,000
<11-8,Monica>瑞秋  大盘子呢  我要你留着大盘子
<11-8,Monica>Hey, Rachel, Howa about the big plate, I want you to have the big plate.

00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:35,370
<11-10,Monica>让你想起我的物件
<11-10,Monica>Something to remember me by.

350
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:39,300
<11-11,Rachel>你又不是快死了  我只是要搬出去
<11-11,Rachel>Mon, you're not dying. l'm just moving out.

00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,750
<11-11,Rachel>我们还是会天天见面
<11-11,Rachel>We're gonna see each other all the time.

352
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,910
<11-12,Monica>但这是个大转变
<11-12,Monica>But still, it's a big change.

353
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:49,380
<11-12,Monica>甚至像是一个时代的结束
<11-12,Monica>The end of an era, you might say.

354
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:54,120
<11-13,Rachel>你还好吗  眼睛都没眨
<11-13,Rachel>Are you okay? You're not blinking.

355
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:59,520
<11-14,Monica>我很好  我只是在想一个时代要结束了
<11-14,Monica>l'm fine. l was thinking about how it's an end of an era.

356
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,560
<11-14,Monica>好吧
<11-14,Monica>Oh, all right.

357
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,570
<11-15,Rachel>但老实说  六年应该称不上一个时代
<11-15,Rachel>But y’know I gotta say, l don't think six years counts as an era.

358
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:10,710
<11-16,Monica>一个时代就是一段重要的日子
<11-16,Monica>An era is defined as a significant period of time.

359
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:14,340
<11-16,Monica>我觉得重要  或许你不觉得重要
<11-16,Monica>lt was significant for me. Maybe it wasn't significant to you!

360
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:17,950
<11-17,Rachel>-你是怎么了  -你才怎么了
<11-17,Rachel>- What is the matter with you?  - What is the matter with you?!

361
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:20,980
<11-18,Monica>你为什么没有更不开心
<11-18,Monica>Why aren't you more upset?

362
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:24,280
<11-18,Monica>我们要分开了  难道你不难过吗
<11-18,Monica>Aren't you gonna be sad that we're not living together any more?

363
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,490
<11-18,Monica>你都不会想我吗
<11-18,Monica>Aren't you gonna miss me at all?
