<2-3,Joey>我刻在街角的提款机上
<2-3,Joey>Uh, I scratched it on the ATM machine down on the corner.

<2-5,Joey>No! Because he didn't believe in my movie!

12
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,220
<2-5,Joey>他大错特错  这次的电影是真的
<2-5,Joey>Which is a big mistake because it is real! Real!

13
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:36,170
<2-5,Joey>我这星期都试着跟他道歉
<2-5,Joey>Y'know what? I have been trying to apologize to him all week!

14
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:37,690
<2-5,Joey>若他不让我在电话上说
<2-5,Joey>If he's not gonna let me do it on the phone,

00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:10,980
<14-3,Phoebe>没关系啦

45
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,170
<14-3,Phoebe>你怎么那么晚
<14-3,Phoebe>What the hell took you so long?

46
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:19,400
<14-4,Monica>不许你跟钱德勒说  我遇见了理查德
<14-4,Monica>Okay, you can not tell Chandler. Okay? That I ran into Richard.

47
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:20,250
<14-5,Phoebe>哪个理查德
<14-5,Phoebe>Which Richard?

48
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:20,930
<14-6,Monica>那个理查德
<14-6,Monica>The Richard.

49
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,620
<14-7,Phoebe>理查德·西蒙斯  天啊(减重专家)
<14-7,Phoebe>Richard Simmons?! Oh my God!

50
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:27,060
<14-8,Monica>不是啦  是我前男友理查德
<14-8,Monica>Noo! My ex-boyfriend Richard!

51
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,100
<14-8,Monica>个子高高有胡子那个
<14-8,Monica>Y'know the tall guy, moustache?

52
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,610
<14-9,Phoebe>好吧  这就说得过去了  情况如何
<14-9,Phoebe>Oh! Okay, that actually makes more sense. So how was it?

53
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,030
<14-10,Monica>好极了  我们先是闲聊
<14-10,Monica>It was, it was really nice. We started talking and I-

54
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,650
<14-10,Monica>后来一起吃了个午饭
<14-10,Monica>I ended up having lunch with him.

55
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:40,030
<14-11,Phoebe>怪了  我有梦到你跟理查德吃饭
<14-11,Phoebe>That is so weird! I had a dream that you'd have lunch with Richard.

56
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:40,610
<14-12,Monica>真的
<14-12,Monica>Really?

57
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,540
<14-13,Phoebe>不过是跟理查德·西蒙斯啦  你继续说
<14-13,Phoebe>But again, Richard Simmons. Go on.

58
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:46,380
<14-14,Monica>奇怪的是  虽然他很棒
<14-14,Monica>The strange part was, he was really nice,

59
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:49,490
<14-14,Monica>也很帅  但是我对他完全没感觉了
<14-14,Monica>umm and he looks great, but I didn't feel anything at all!

60
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,680
<14-15,Phoebe>那为什么不能跟钱德勒说
<14-15,Phoebe>Ooh! So now why can't we tell Chandler?

61
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:53,650
<14-16,Monica>他听了一定会发神经
<14-16,Monica>Because it would totally freak him out

62
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:54,990
<14-16,Monica>明天就是我们的周年纪念
<14-16,Monica>and tomorrow's our anniversary.

63
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,360
<14-16,Monica>我不想搞砸
<14-16,Monica>I just don't want anything to spoil that.

64
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,900
<14-17,Phoebe>不敢相信你们交往一年了
<14-17,Phoebe>Oh, I can't believe you guys lasted a whole year!

65
00:02:58,900 --> 00:02:59,600
<14-18,Monica>就是
<14-18,Monica>I know.

66
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,590
<14-19,Phoebe>我欠瑞秋二十块
<14-19,Phoebe>Wow! I owe Rachel 20 bucks!

67
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,310
<14-20,Monica>什么
<14-20,Monica>What?

68
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,010
<14-21,Phoebe>那是完全不相干的赌局啦
<14-21,Phoebe>On a totally different bet.

69
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,100
<14-23,Monica>一周年纪念日快到了
<14-23,Monica>It's almost our anniversary!

70
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,940
<14-24,Chandler>我知道  你相信吗
<14-24,Chandler>I know. Can you believe it?

71
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:15,300
<14-24,Chandler>一年前的今天  我还只是你烦人的朋友钱德勒
<14-24,Chandler>One year ago today I was just your annoying friend Chandler.

72
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,300
<14-25,Phoebe>现在你只是我的烦人朋友钱德勒
<14-25,Phoebe>Awww! Now you're just my annoying friend Chandler.

84
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,040
<14-35,Monica>不用
<14-35,Monica>No.

85
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,880
<14-36,Chandler>这是很棒  但乔伊说了不要我们过去
<14-36,Chandler>Okay this is great, but Joey said he didn't want any of us out there.

86
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:03,980
<14-37,Monica>他只是怕麻烦我们而已
<14-37,Monica>Oh, he just doesn't want us to go through any trouble.

87
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:06,870
<14-37,Monica>到时我们突然出现  他一定超兴奋的
<14-37,Monica>Think of how excited he'll be when we go out and surprise him!

96
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,920
<14-45,Phoebe>少来  休想像上次伦敦那样把我甩掉
<14-45,Phoebe>Oh please, you are not gonna ditch again like you did with London.

97
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:33,830
<14-46,Monica>菲比  哪有甩掉  当时你怀了三胞胎
<14-46,Monica>Ditch you? Phoebe, you were pregnant with the triplets!

98
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,430

<14-53,Phoebe>你当然可以请几天假
<14-53,Phoebe>Of course you can take a couple days off work

<14-55,Ross>我盼了一年才盼到
<14-55,Ross>I've been waiting like a year for this.

109
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,700
<14-58,Chandler>瑞秋  不如我们周六再飞过去
<14-58,Chandler>So Rach, maybe you and I can fly out together Saturday.

110
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,310
<14-60,Chandler>听起来很可行
<14-60,Chandler>That sounds great.

111
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,040
<14-63,Ross>-那我打电话去订票  -好的
<14-63,Ross>- Yeah? All right I'll call the airlines. - Okay.

112
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,740
<14-64,Rachel>其实想起来很不赖
<14-64,Rachel>Yeah, that would be nice actually,

113
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,540
<14-64,Rachel>我可以独自在公寓过一晚
<14-64,Rachel>to have the apartment to myself for a night.

114
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,830
<14-65,Phoebe>对  你可以脱光光到处走
<14-65,Phoebe>Oh yeah, so you can walk around naked.

115
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,740
<14-66,Rachel>不是  我可以自己一个人
<14-66,Rachel>No! So I can be by myself. Y'know?

116
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,120
<14-66,Rachel>享受下独处的时光
<14-66,Rachel>Have a little alone time.

117
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:25,800
<14-67,Phoebe>脱光光的独处时光
<14-67,Phoebe>Naked alone time.

118
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:28,080
<14-68,Rachel>菲比  我一个人独处
<14-68,Rachel>No! Phoebe just because I'm alone

119
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,640
<14-68,Rachel>并不表示我就想脱光光到处走
<14-68,Rachel>doesn't mean I wanna walk around naked.

120
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,690
<14-68,Rachel>你自己一个人住  你也不会脱光光到处走啊
<14-68,Rachel>I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked.

121
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:35,440
<14-69,Phoebe>你以为我为何老半天才应门
<14-69,Phoebe>Uh-huh! Why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door?

122
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,780
<15-1,Phoebe>迄今为止
<15-1,Phoebe>So, so far

123
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:46,640
<15-1,Phoebe>比起伦敦之行  赌城之行是好还是差
<15-1,Phoebe>is this trip to Las Vegas better or worse than the trip to London?

124
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:49,460
<15-2,Chandler>菲比  到现在为止都差不多
<15-2,Chandler>So it's pretty much the same Pheebs.

125
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:53,600
<15-3,Phoebe>那我给你们糖果之后呢
<15-3,Phoebe>Okay, what about after I give you these candies?
