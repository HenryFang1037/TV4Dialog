1
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:07,150
<1-1,Ross>-大家感恩节快乐 -不
<1-1,Ross>- Hey, everybody. Happy Thanksgiving. - No, no, no.

2
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:10,190
<1-3,Ross>不能让大家知道今年有感恩节吗
<1-3,Ross>What are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year?

3
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,520
<1-4,Chandler>我们正在玩一个游戏
<1-4,Chandler>We're playing a game I learned at work.

4
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:15,290
<1-4,Chandler>你得在六分钟内写出美国各州州名
<1-4,Chandler>You have to name all the states in six minutes.

5
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:18,130
<1-5,Ross>什么   那太容易了
<1-5,Ross>What? That's like insanely easy.

6
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:20,930
<1-6,Chandler>事实上这个游戏很难  你总是会漏掉一个
<1-6,Chandler>It's harder than it sounds. You always forget at least one.

7
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:24,300
<1-6,Chandler>某些人会漏掉十四个
<1-6,Chandler>Or, in some cases, 14.

8
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:28,310
<1-7,Monica>这大蠢了  我没有跟任何人玩
<1-7,Monica>It's stupid and I wasn't playing against people,

9
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:30,040
<1-7,Monica>所以技术上来说我没输
<1-7,Monica>so technically, I didn't lose.

10
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:32,280
<1-8,Ross>你忘了十四个
<1-8,Ross>You forgot 14 states?

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,850
<1-9,Monica>没有人在乎达科他州
<1-9,Monica>Nobody cares about the Dakotas!

12
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:37,680
<1-10,Chandler>好了  时间到
<1-10,Chandler>Okay, time's up.

13
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,290
<1-11,Rachel>好了  我写出四十八州
<1-11,Rachel>All right, I got 48.

14
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:40,980
<1-12,Chandler>还不错  菲比
<1-12,Chandler>That's not bad. Pheebs?

15
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:42,890
<1-13,Phoebe>我厌倦了写州名
<1-13,Phoebe>I got tired of naming states,

16
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:45,290
<1-13,Phoebe>所以决定写出各种芹菜的名字
<1-13,Phoebe>so I decided to list the types of celery.

17
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:49,460
<1-13,Phoebe>我写了一个普通芹菜
<1-13,Phoebe>And I have one, regular celery.

18
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:54,670
<1-14,Chandler>瑞秋写出四十八州  菲比在...
<1-14,Chandler>So Rachel's got 48, and Phoebe has the lead in...

19
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:57,570
<1-14,Chandler>蔬菜名称方面称霸   乔伊呢
<1-14,Chandler>...vegetables. Joey?

20
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:01,070
<1-15,Joey>跟钱德勒愚蠢州名游戏的新冠军打声招呼吧
<1-15,Joey>Say hello to the new champ of Chandler's dumb states game.

21
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,310
<1-16,Ross>-哇你写了几个  -56个
<1-16,Ross>- Wow, how many you got? - Fifty-six.

33
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,380
<2-1,Joey>新英格兰为什么不是一个州
<2-1,Joey>Hey, how is New England not a state?

34
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:50,750
<2-1,Joey>他们有运动代表队
<2-1,Joey>They have a sports team.

35
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:55,890
<2-2,Chandler>南奥勒冈有运动代表队吗
<2-2,Chandler>Does South Oregon have a sports team?

36
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,690
<2-2,Chandler>你说的也有道理啦
<2-2,Chandler>There you go.

37
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,690
<2-2,Chandler>为什么多了一套餐具
<2-2,Chandler>How come we have one extra place setting?

38
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,400
<2-2,Chandler>你邀了你的助理过来
<2-2,Chandler>You invited your assistant.

39
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:06,330
<3-1,Rachel>对了  抱歉  泰格不来了
<3-1,Rachel>Oh, right, sorry. Tag's not coming.

40
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:09,400
<3-2,Monica>他女朋友来了  所以他得去陪她过感恩节
<3-2,Monica>His girlfriend came into town, so he's spending Thanksgiving with her.

41
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,630
<3-3,Rachel>你为什么没有告诉我
<3-3,Rachel>Why didn't you tell me?

42
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,140
<3-4,Monica>我帮他做了专属的红薯南瓜
<3-4,Monica>I made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin.

43
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,440
<3-5,Rachel>我本来想说  但我想
<3-5,Rachel>I was going to, but then I figured...

44
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,910
<3-5,Rachel>你做的菜既好吃  又好看
<3-5,Rachel>...your food is so delicious and perfect...

45
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:24,450
<3-5,Rachel>我想多吃一点你做的南瓜
<3-5,Rachel>...you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.

46
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,990
<3-6,Monica>你会觉得你转得太假  我会不相信
<3-6,Monica>You'd think I wouldn't enjoy

47
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:29,750
<3-6,Monica>但我还是觉得很高兴
<3-6,Monica>that because it is so fake, but I still do.

48
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,720
<3-7,Phoebe>普通芹菜
<3-7,Phoebe>Regular celery!

49
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,760
<3-7,Phoebe>我已经写了
<3-7,Phoebe>I already have that.

50
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,420
<3-8,Ross>好了
<3-8,Ross>Done...

51
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,730
<3-8,Ross>时间还剩下很多
<3-8,Ross>...with time to spare.

52
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,420
<3-9,Chandler>这可能是新世界记录本
<3-9,Chandler>This may be a new world's record.

53
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,600
<3-10,Ross>我讨厌对你们说教
<3-10,Ross>I hate to lecture you guys...

54
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:49,470
<3-10,Ross>一群受过良好教育的成年人
<3-10,Ross>...but it's disgraceful that a group of well-educated adults...

55
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:54,380
<3-10,Ross>跟乔伊  无法写出全部的州名真是太丢脸了
<3-10,Ross>...and Joey, can't name all the states.

56
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,630
<3-10,Ross>你们看过地图  或是圆圆的
<3-10,Ross>You ever see a map, or one of those round,

57
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,990
<3-10,Ross>而且色彩鲜艳叫做"地球仪"的东西吗
<3-10,Ross>colorful things called a "Globe"?

58
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:04,260
<3-11,Chandler>麦哲伦先生   你只答对了46个州
<3-11,Chandler>Magellan? You got 46 states.

59
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:08,130
<3-12,Ross>- 什么  那是不可能的  -46个州
<3-12,Ross>- What? That's impossible. - Forty-six.

60
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,770
<3-13,Joey>现在是谁枉费良好教育了  漏了十个州先生
<3-13,Joey>Well, who's well-educated now, Mr. L-Forgot-Ten-States?

61
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,830
<3-14,Monica>我要借用乔伊的烤箱
<3-14,Monica>I'm going to go turn on Joey's oven.

62
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:19,070
<3-14,Monica>拜托看好他  别让乔伊偷吃东西
<3-14,Monica>Please, watch him. Do not let Joey eat any of the food.

63
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,940
<3-15,Chandler>我只有一个人
<3-15,Chandler>I am only one man.

64
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:25,740
<3-16,Ross>-好了  时间到  -再给我一分钟
<3-16,Ross>- Okay, time is up. - Now, just give me another minute.

65
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:29,110
<3-17,Chandler>如果现在想不出来你永远都想不出来  好吗
<3-17,Chandler>If you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay?

66
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,250
<3-17,Chandler>这才是这个游戏的魅力所在
<3-17,Chandler>That is the beauty of this game.

67
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,350
<3-17,Chandler>它会让你想要杀了自己
<3-17,Chandler>It makes you want to kill yourself.

68
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,850
<3-18,Ross>这太疯狂了  我可以的
<3-18,Ross>This is crazy. I can do this.

69
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:39,530
<3-18,Ross>好吧  我能在吃晚餐前写出五十州的州名
<3-18,Ross>All right, I bet I can get all 50 before dinner.

70
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,990
<3-19,Chandler>好吧  但你写不出来就不能吃晚餐
<3-19,Chandler>Okay, but if you can't, no dinner.

71
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:43,600
<3-20,Ross>就这么说定了
<3-20,Ross>You're on.

72
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,930
<3-21,Joey>别偷看我写的答案
<3-21,Joey>Don't look at my list,

73
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,460
<3-21,Joey>里面可是有很多你写不出来的州名
<3-21,Joey>because there's a lot on there that you don't have.

74
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,300
<3-22,Monica>你知道你的烤箱坏了吗
<3-22,Monica>Did you know your oven doesn't work?

75
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:55,380
<3-23,Joey>装满外送菜单的抽屉没坏吧
<3-23,Joey>The drawer full of takeout menus is okay, right?

76
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:57,880
<3-24,Monica>罗斯  我要借用你的烤箱
<3-24,Monica>Ross, I'm gonna use yours.

77
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:01,550
<3-26,Monica>钱德勒  快来帮我
<3-26,Monica>Chandler, give me a hand.

78
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:03,470
<3-27,Chandler>乔伊  别让罗斯
<3-27,Chandler>Joey, do not let Ross

79
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,990
<3-27,Chandler>偷看地图或任何一个你家的地球仪
<3-27,Chandler>look at maps or any of the globes in your apartment.

80
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:10,160
<3-28,Joey>别担心  那又不是美国的地球仪
<3-28,Joey>Don't worry. It's not a globe of the United States.

81
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:20,500
<4-1,Phoebe>我要去散步
<4-1,Phoebe>I'm gonna go out and take a walk.

82
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:23,000
<4-2,Ross>菲比  你的包包为什么在动
<4-2,Ross>Phoebe, why is your bag moving?

83
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:25,770
<4-4,Rachel>-才没有  -它真的在动
<4-4,Rachel>- Oh, it's not. - Seriously, it's moving.

84
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:29,470
<4-6,Phoebe>-里面装了什么东西   -只是我的棒针而己
<4-6,Phoebe>- What the hell's in there? - It's just my knitting. That's all.

85
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:37,380
<4-6,Phoebe>对  我织了这个
<4-6,Phoebe>Yes, I knit this.

86
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,520
<4-6,Phoebe>我真的很厉害
<4-6,Phoebe>I'm very good.

87
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:48,360
<4-6,Phoebe>罗斯的公寓很好  为什么我们从不来这里玩
<4-6,Phoebe>Ross' apartment is nice. How come we don't hang out here?

88
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,360
<5-1,Monica>或许是因为它有怪味道
<5-1,Monica>Maybe because it smells a weird.

89
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,830
<5-2,Chandler>有点像是放久的南瓜昧
<5-2,Chandler>It's like old pumpkins or something.

90
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:56,360
<5-4,Chandler>-那是我的派  -这个味道好香
<5-4,Chandler>- That's my pie. - Which smells delicious.

00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,880
<5-5,Monica>-哎呀  -怎么了
<5-5,Monica>- Uh-oh. Uh-oh. - What?

92
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,050
<5-6,Chandler>我们让乔伊跟食物独处
<5-6,Chandler>We left Joey alone with the food.

93
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,510
<5-7,Monica>没错  我就知道
<5-7,Monica>Yep, yep, I knew it.

<7-20,Monica>我也希望能留它在这里  但钱德勒对狗过敏
<7-20,Monica>I wish he could stay here, but Chandler's allergic.

129
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:09,250
<7-21,Chandler>我对狗严重过敏  好吗
<7-21,Chandler>Extremely allergic, okay?

130
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,680
<7-21,Chandler>只要我一靠近狗  超过五分钟
<7-21,Chandler>If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than five minutes...

131
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,520
<7-21,Chandler>我的气管会闭合
<7-21,Chandler>...my throat will just close up.

132
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:19,250
<7-22,Phoebe>真是奇怪  这只狗在这里住了三天
<7-22,Phoebe>That's odd. This dog's been living here for the past three days.

133
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:26,670
<7-23,Chandler>真的吗
<7-23,Chandler>Really?

134
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,690
<7-24,Monica>如果它在这里住了那么久
<7-24,Monica>If he's been here that long...

135
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,650
<7-24,Monica>你一点反应都
<7-24,Monica>...and you haven't had a reaction,

136
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:33,270
<7-24,Monica>没有或许你对它不会过敏
<7-24,Monica>maybe you're not allergic to it.

137
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,070
<7-25,Chandler>它还是得离开  好吗
<7-25,Chandler>It still has to go, right?

138
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,440
<7-27,Chandler>为什么
<7-27,Chandler>Why?

139
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:40,410
<7-28,Joey>-好吧  我...  -别那么做
<7-28,Joey>- Okay, it's... - Don't do it!

140
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:44,390
<7-29,Monica>-别做什么   -我非说不可
<7-29,Monica>- Don't do what? - I have to.

141
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,890
<7-30,Chandler>好吗  是时候了
<7-30,Chandler>Okay? It's time.

142
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,730
<7-30,Chandler>好吧  我讨厌狗
<7-30,Chandler>Okay, I hate dogs.

143
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,900
<7-32,Phoebe>-什么  -太疯狂了 -为什么  -疯了吧
<7-32,Phoebe>- What?! - That's crazy? - Why? -Are you out of your mind?

144
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:57,930
<7-34,Phoebe>我早跟你说过了
<7-34,Phoebe>Told you.

145
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:04,210
<7-36,Chandler>它们很需要关注
<7-36,Chandler>They are needy...

146
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:07,310
<7-36,Chandler>喜欢乱跳  你不知道它们在想什么
<7-36,Chandler>...jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking...

147
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:10,010
<7-36,Chandler>那把我吓得半死
<7-36,Chandler>...and that scares me a little bit.

148
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:13,310
<7-37,Ross>你说得对  它们很可怕
<7-37,Ross>You're right. They are scary.

149
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,920
<7-37,Ross>它缸吃掉了放在我手上的点心
<7-37,Ross>She just ate a treat out of my hand!

150
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,510
<7-38,Rachel>等一下  所有狗你都不喜欢
<7-38,Rachel>Wait. Do you not like all dogs?

151
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,160
<7-38,Rachel>连小狗都不喜欢
<7-38,Rachel>I mean, not even puppies?

152
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,950
<7-39,Chandler>这里有小狗吗
<7-39,Chandler>Is there a puppy here?

153
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:28,360
<7-40,Tag>-你不喜欢小狗   -你是新来的
<7-40,Tag>- You don't like puppies? - Okay, you are new.

154
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,170
<7-41,Chandler>听着  钱德勒  我跟你说过
<7-41,Chandler>Look, Chandler, I told you.

155
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,740
<7-42,Joey>别跟其他人说你不喜欢狗
<7-42,Joey>Never tell anyone about this dog thing.

156
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:38,910
<7-42,Joey>这就像罗斯不喜欢冰淇淋
<7-42,Joey>It's like Ross not liking ice cream.

157
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:43,770
<7-43,Phoebe>-你不喜欢冰淇淋  -它太冰了
<7-43,Phoebe>- You don't like ice cream? - It's too cold!

158
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,910
<7-45,Chandler>狗让我觉得很不舒服
<7-45,Chandler>It's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable.

159
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,610
<7-46,Ross>我的牙齿被冰得好痛
<7-46,Ross>Hurts my teeth.

160
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:52,750
<7-47,Chandler>我不想这么说  我不希望你们讨厌我
<7-47,Chandler>I don't wanna say this, and I don't want you guys to hate me...

161
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:56,620
<7-47,Chandler>我不能待在这只狗的周围  行
<7-47,Chandler>...but I don't think I can be around that dog anymore, okay?

162
00:08:56,890 --> 00:09:00,260
<7-47,Chandler>不是那只狗走  就是我走
<7-47,Chandler>So either the dog goes or I go.

163
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,800
<7-47,Chandler>我的天啊
<7-47,Chandler>Oh, my God!

164
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,840
<7-48,Ross>我怎么可能答不出来
<7-48,Ross>How can I not get this?

165
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,610
<7-48,Ross>我是大学教授  SAT考试考了1450分
<7-48,Ross>I'm a college professor. I got 1450 on my SATs.

166
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,250
<7-49,Monica>是1250分才对
<7-49,Monica>Twelve-fifty.

167
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,410
<7-50,Ross>该死  我忘了你在这里
<7-50,Ross>Damn, I forgot you were here.

168
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:26,310
<7-51,Phoebe>我们得把克朗克送到罗斯家
<7-51,Phoebe>We're gonna take Klunkers to Ross'.

169
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:27,780
<7-51,Phoebe>马上就回来
<7-51,Phoebe>We'll be back in a minute.

170
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,860
<7-52,Rachel>在你们离开前我能问你们一个问题吗
<7-52,Rachel>Before you go, can I ask you a question?

171
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:32,860
<7-54,Rachel>如果一个男人跟女朋友分手了
<7-54,Rachel>When a guy breaks up with his girlfriend...

172
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,530
<7-54,Rachel>我得等多久才能采取行动
<7-54,Rachel>...what is an appropriate amount of time

173
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:37,160
<7-54,Rachel>才能采取行动
<7-54,Rachel>to wait before you make a move?

174
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:39,030
<7-55,Phoebe>我想是一个月
<7-55,Phoebe>I'd say about a month.

175
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,330
<7-56,Monica>真的吗   我觉得是三到四个月
<7-56,Monica>Really? I'd say three to four.

176
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,530
<7-57,Joey>半小时
<7-57,Joey>Half-hour.

177
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,240
<7-58,Rachel>真有趣
<7-58,Rachel>Interesting.

178
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:50,880
<7-59,Monica>但他是你的助理  我劝你别那么做
<7-59,Monica>When it's your assistant, I'd say never.

179
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:54,680
<7-60,Joey>瑞秋  问题是他喜欢你吗
<7-60,Joey>All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you?

180
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:58,840
<7-60,Joey>如果他不喜欢你  那这都对牛放屁
<7-60,Joey>Because if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo point.

181
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,250
<7-61,Rachel>对牛"放屁"
<7-61,Rachel>A "Moo" Point?

182
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:08,260
<7-62,Joey>对  牛不知道你做了什么
<7-62,Joey>Yeah. It's like a cow's opinion.

183
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:11,790
<7-62,Joey>那不重要
<7-62,Joey>It just doesn't matter.

184
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:15,770
<7-62,Joey>那是在"放屁"
<7-62,Joey>It's "Moo."

185
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:24,250
<7-63,Rachel>是我跟他同居太久
<7-63,Rachel>Have I been living with him for too long,

186
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,770
<7-63,Rachel>还是他的话真的有道理
<7-63,Rachel>or did that all just make sense?

187
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,080
<7-64,Monica>别听乔伊的
<7-64,Monica>Don't listen to Joey.

188
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,270
<7-64,Monica>好吧  看看他的样子
<7-64,Monica>Okay, would you look at him?

189
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,270
<7-64,Monica>他很沮丧  家人又不在身边
<7-64,Monica>He's obviously depressed. He's away from his family.

190
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:34,820
<7-64,Monica>他和陌生人一起过感恩节
<7-64,Monica>He is spending his Thanksgiving with strangers.

191
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,640
<7-64,Monica>现在他需要你这个朋友
<7-64,Monica>What he needs right now is for you to be his friend.

192
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,920
<7-65,Rachel>你说得对  对不起  谢谢
<7-65,Rachel>You're right. I'm sorry. Thank you.

193
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,890
<7-65,Rachel>好吧  我会那么做的
<7-65,Rachel>Okay, that's what I'm going to do.

194
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:44,100
<7-66,Joey>很好  照她们的话去做
<7-66,Joey>Fine, take their advice.

195
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:45,840
<7-66,Joey>反正没有人会听我的话
<7-66,Joey>No one ever listens to me.

196
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:49,530
<7-66,Joey>只要包装好看  没有人会在乎内容
<7-66,Joey>When the package is this pretty, no one cares what's inside.

197
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,850
<8-1,Rachel>-嘿  -嘿
<8-1,Rachel>- Hey. - Hey.

198
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,610
<8-3,Rachel>你还好吧
<8-3,Rachel>How you holding up?

199
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,510
<8-4,Tag>还可以
<8-4,Tag>Not bad.

200
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,020
<8-5,Rachel>-关于你女朋友的事我很遗憾  -谢谢
<8-5,Rachel>- I'm sorry about your girlfriend. - Thanks.

201
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,850
<8-7,Rachel>你们在一起很久了吗
<8-7,Rachel>Were you guys together a long time?

202
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:09,490
<8-8,Tag>1年了  总是分分合合的
<8-8,Tag>A year, on and off.

203
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,170
<8-8,Tag>我以为我们会相守一生 现在我不会那么想了
<8-8,Tag>I kind of thought we'd end up together. I don't anymore.

204
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,890
<8-9,Rachel>-因为她跟你分手了  -对
<8-9,Rachel>- Now that she broke up with you. - Yeah.

205
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:18,800
<8-11,Rachel>这真的很奇怪
<8-11,Rachel>It's weird.

206
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:20,800
<8-12,Tag>我以前总以为
<8-12,Tag>I used to assume that I would

207
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,440
<8-12,Tag>我会遇见一个人坠入爱河  过着幸福的生活
<8-12,Tag>meet someone and fall in love and be happy.

208
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,530
<8-12,Tag>好像很自然而然
<8-12,Tag>That all that was just a given.

209
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:27,710
<8-12,Tag>最近我会想如果不是那样呢
<8-12,Tag>Lately, it's like, what if it's not?

210
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,210
<8-12,Tag>你有那种感觉吗
<8-12,Tag>Do you ever have that feeling?

211
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:31,940
<7-52,Rachel>没
<7-52,Rachel>No.

212
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:33,610
<7-53,Monica>好吧  有
<7-53,Monica>Yeah.

213
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:36,960
<8-13,Rachel>我常有这感觉  一直都有  那真的很可怕
<8-13,Rachel>All the time. Constantly. It's terrifying.

214
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:40,460
<8-14,Tag>但后来我想通了一定会有那个人的
<8-14,Tag>But, you know, then I figure, it has to work out.

215
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,450
<8-14,Tag>为什么
<8-14,Tag>Why?

216
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,290
<8-15,Rachel>因为一定有的
<8-15,Rachel>Because it has to.

217
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,010
<8-16,Tag>你真的什么都知道  对吧
<8-16,Tag>You really have all the answers, don't you?

218
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:50,070
<8-17,Rachel>没错  我真的什么都知道
<8-17,Rachel>No, no, I do. I really do.

219
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,520
<8-18,Tag>谢谢你陪我聊天
<8-18,Tag>Thanks for talking to me.

220
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,940
<8-18,Tag>别这样  这不是上司的工作吗
<8-18,Tag>Come on, what are bosses for?

221
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,540
<8-19,Rachel>快来抱一下吧
<8-19,Rachel>Hug it out.

222
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:00,240
<8-20,Joey>好了  他也喜欢你
<8-20,Joey>All right, he likes you back.

223
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:05,320
<8-20,Joey>我说过你该表白的
<8-20,Joey>Told you, you should go for it.

224
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,950
<8-21,Tag>什么
<8-21,Tag>What?

225
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,520
<8-22,Joey>下面的噪音有没有盖过那句话
<8-22,Joey>Street noise drown any of that out?

226
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,320
<8-22,Joey>没有吗   待会见
<8-22,Joey>No? See you later.

227
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:17,590
<8-22,Joey>好吧
<8-22,Joey>Okay.

228
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:25,280
<9-1,Tag>刚刚乔伊说了什么   我也喜欢你
<9-1,Tag>What did Joey say? I like you back?

229
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:27,920
<9-2,Rachel>你知道的  他
<9-2,Rachel>You know... Well, see... He...

230
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:33,850
<9-2,Rachel>乔伊知道我对我的背没信心
<9-2,Rachel>Joey knows that I'm very insecure about my back.

231
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,360
<9-2,Rachel>刚刚你在抱我
<9-2,Rachel>And you were hugging me...

232
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,730
<9-2,Rachel>很明显地你不讨厌它  没错
<9-2,Rachel>...so, obviously, you are not repulsed by it. Yeah!

233
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:46,530
<9-3,Tag>-那根本就说不通  -说不通吗
<9-3,Tag>- Wait, that doesn't make any sense. - No?

234
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:52,240
<9-4,Rachel>好吧  事实是这样的
<9-4,Rachel>All right, here's the truth.

235
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:55,920
<9-4,Rachel>乔伊会那么说
<9-4,Rachel>Joey said what he said...

236
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,450
<9-4,Rachel>因为我被你吸引
<9-4,Rachel>...because I'm attracted to you.

237
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:03,620
<9-5,Tag>对  我承认
<9-5,Tag>Yeah, I admit it.

238
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:05,780
<9-5,Tag>我暗恋你
<9-5,Tag>I have a crush on you.

239
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:09,060
<9-6,Rachel>我知道那很疯狂  因为我们是同事
<9-6,Rachel>I know that's crazy because we work together...

240
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,960
<9-6,Rachel>我们之间不该发生任何事
<9-6,Rachel>...and nothing could ever happen.

241
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,640
<9-6,Rachel>我一点都不想吓到你
<9-6,Rachel>The last thing I wanted to do was freak you out...

242
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:16,840
<9-6,Rachel>或是让你觉得不自在
<9-6,Rachel>...or make you feel uncomfortable.

243
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,930
<9-6,Rachel>所以我认为
<9-6,Rachel>Which is why it would be really great

244
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:21,570
<9-6,Rachel>你最好快说句话

<9-7,Tag>我的天啊  那些家伙在偷我的车

<9-10,Rachel>你有话要跟我说吗
<9-10,Rachel>Do you have anything else you want to get off your chest?

250
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:35,990
<9-11,Tag>我简直不敢相信
<9-11,Tag>I can't believe this.

251
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:40,060
<9-12,Rachel>我们还有时间  他们还没上车
<9-12,Rachel>We still have time to talk, and they're not even in the car yet.

252
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,230
<9-12,Rachel>好吧  上车了
<9-12,Rachel>Look, there they go.

253
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,600
<10-1,Monica>好了  菲比  或许我们该回去了
<10-1,Monica>Okay, Phoebe. We should probably go back now.

254
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,500
<10-2,Phoebe>求求你别离开我  我会很寂寞的
<10-2,Phoebe>Please, don't leave me. I'll be lonely.

255
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:52,630
<10-3,Monica>别说了
<10-3,Monica>Stop it. Stop.

256

<10-3,Monica>-我们走吧  我们可以很坚强的  -好吧
<10-3,Monica>- Okay, let's go. We can be strong. - Yeah, okay.

257
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:02,580
<10-5,Monica>你听到了吗   它在叫"莫妮卡"
<10-5,Monica>Did you hear that? She said, "Monica."

258
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:06,180
<10-5,Monica>我不能丢下它
<10-5,Monica>I can't leave her.

259
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:09,480
<10-6,Phoebe>我们偷偷把狗带回去  钱德勒不会发现的
<10-6,Phoebe>We could sneak the dog back in, and Chandler wouldn't even know.

260
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:10,680
<10-7,Monica>那是行不通的
<10-7,Monica>That's not gonna work.

261
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:14,120
<10-8,Phoebe>我把小狗藏在房间里三天  钱德勒完全不知道
<10-8,Phoebe>I had that dog for three days, and Chandler had no idea.

262
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,760
<10-8,Phoebe>他没有那么聪明
<10-8,Phoebe>He's not so smart.

263
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:18,530
<10-9,Monica>我也不知道
<10-9,Monica>Hey. I didn't know either.

264
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:20,150
<10-10,Phoebe>对  但你觉得
<10-10,Phoebe>Yeah, but you kind of

265
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:23,100
<10-10,Phoebe>怪怪的  对吧
<10-10,Phoebe>knew that something was going on, didn't you?

266
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:25,040
<10-11,Monica>没错  我知道
<10-11,Monica>Yeah, I knew.

00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:40,010
<11-4,Chandler>你怎么知道
<11-4,Chandler>How did you know?

270
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:46,220
<11-5,Ross>它怎么又回来了
<11-5,Ross>Hey, what's she doing back here?

271
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:49,360
<11-6,Monica>别激动罗斯  它不是冰淇淋做的
<11-6,Monica>Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream.

272
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:54,430
<11-7,Ross>菲比  我照位置将各州州名排好
<11-7,Ross>Hey, look, Phoebe. I laid out the states geographically.

273
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,040
<11-8,Phoebe>没时间谈这件事了
<11-8,Phoebe>We don't have time for this.

274
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,940
<11-8,Phoebe>我们不能让钱德勒靠近我房间
<11-8,Phoebe>We have to keep him away from my room.

275
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:02,080
<11-10,Phoebe>-对  但是  -所以我们没有时间了
<11-10,Phoebe>- Yeah, but, look what... - This is what we do not have time for!

278
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,480
<11-13,Chandler>为什么
<11-13,Chandler>Why not?

279
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,990
<11-14,Ross>莫妮卡大哭
<11-14,Ross>Monica's crying.

280
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:21,330
<11-14,Ross>关于克朗克的事她非常难过
<11-14,Ross>She's very upset about this whole Klunkers thing.

<11-15,Chandler>-我应该进去的  -不
<11-15,Chandler>- Well, I should go in there. - No, no.

283
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:32,540
<11-17,Chandler>-为什么   -因为是你把那只狗赶走的
<11-17,Chandler>- Why not? - Because you sent away the dog.

284
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:36,040
<11-19,Chandler>-那太可笑了  -是吗
<11-19,Chandler>- That's ridiculous. - Oh, is it? Is it?!

285
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:42,840
<11-20,Ross>莫妮卡跟我小时候 我们养了一只狗叫路佛
<11-20,Ross>Look, when Monica and I were kids, we had a dog named Rover.

286
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:46,920
<11-20,Ross>有一天我爸决定他不喜欢狗
<11-20,Ross>And one day, my dad decides he doesn't like dogs.

287
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,080
<11-20,Ross>莫妮卡跟她的朋友菲丽丝

<11-20,Ross>把狗送走
<11-20,Ross>...take away the dog,

289
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,030
<11-20,Ross>那是我们 最后一次见到它  好吗
<11-20,Ross>and that was the last time we ever saw him. See?

290
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:59,030
<11-20,Ross>这次也一样
<11-20,Ross>This is just like that...

291
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:03,140
<11-20,Ross>只不过有些细节不一样
<11-20,Ross>...only with a few details changed.

<11-22,Chandler>- What's the matter? - Monica's upset because of Klunkers.

295
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:21,250
<11-23,Joey>所以呢   把狗抱回来你会成为大英雄的
<11-23,Joey>So? Bring the dog back. You're a hero.

296
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:25,220
<11-24,Chandler>对  我可以当大英雄 我可以那么做
<11-24,Chandler>Yeah, I could be a hero. I could do that.

297
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,660
<11-24,Chandler>万一它攻击我呢
<11-24,Chandler>What if it attacks me?

298
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:30,930
<11-25,Joey>钱德勒  它就像只大沙鼠
<11-25,Joey>Chandler, it's like a big gerbil.

299
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,230
<11-26,Chandler>你居然不害怕吗
<11-26,Chandler>And that doesn't scare you?

300
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,970
<11-27,Joey>罗斯  你需要帮忙吗

00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,310
<11-32,Rachel>我知道我吓坏他了
<11-32,Rachel>I know that I freaked him out.

311
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,420
<11-33,Joey>如果你是那种语气  他一定吓坏了
<11-33,Joey>If you said it like that, you did.

312
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:29,550
<11-34,Phoebe>钱德勒在吗
<11-34,Phoebe>Hey, is Chandler here?

<12-7,Monica>- What? Why would...? - Wait and see.

322
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,180
<12-8,Phoebe>或许我们会  或许我们不会
<12-8,Phoebe>Maybe we will, maybe we won't.

323
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,620
<12-8,Phoebe>我跑到罗斯家
<12-8,Phoebe>Okay, I went over to Ross' apartment

324
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,760
<12-9,Chandler>想帮你把克朗克抱回来
<12-9,Chandler>to bring back Klunkers for you...

325
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:10,650
<12-9,Chandler>我忘了关门  它一定是跑出去了
<12-9,Chandler>...and I left the door open, and she must've gotten out.

326
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,700
<12-9,Chandler>我到处找过
<12-9,Chandler>And I looked everywhere,

327
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:15,390
<12-9,Chandler>找遍整栋公寓  包括屋顶
<12-9,Chandler>all over the apartment, including the roof.

328
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:19,570
<12-9,Chandler>对了  罗斯你邻居在屋顶上种大麻
<12-9,Chandler>Which, FYI, Ross, one of your neighbors, growing weed.

329
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:22,870
<12-9,Chandler>我找不到它
<12-9,Chandler>I couldn't find him...

330
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:27,040
<12-9,Chandler>我真的很抱歉
<12-9,Chandler>...and I am so, so, so sorry.

331
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,840
<12-9,Chandler>但我知道怎么样能让大家忘记痛苦[大麻]
<12-9,Chandler>But I do know where we can all go ease the pain.

332
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:36,620
<12-10,Phoebe>我们有好消息  看看谁回来了
<12-10,Phoebe>We have good news. Look who's back!

333

<12-12,Chandler>克朗克  我的天啊
<12-12,Chandler>Klunkers. Oh, my God!

334
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:46,420
<12-13,Monica>-它是自己跑回来的  -这是感恩节奇迹
<12-13,Monica>- She came back all by herself. - It's a Thanksgiving miracle.

335
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:50,700
<12-15,Chandler>真高兴能见到你
<12-15,Chandler>It is so good to see you.

336
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,030
<12-16,Phoebe>它从罗斯家跑了回来
<12-16,Phoebe>She came all the way back from Ross' building.

337
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:56,000
<12-16,Phoebe>它一定遇到很多事
<12-16,Phoebe>The things she must've seen.

338
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,370
<12-16,Phoebe>它爬上消防梯
<12-16,Phoebe>She climbed up the fire escape...

339
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:01,240
<12-16,Phoebe>用它的小脚拍打窗户
<12-16,Phoebe>...and she tapped on the window with her teeny, little paw,

340
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,310
<12-16,Phoebe>我们跑去开窗让它进来
<12-16,Phoebe>and we ran to let her in.

341
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,080
<12-16,Phoebe>我说的太过火了  对吧
<12-16,Phoebe>I went too far, didn't I?

342
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:10,010
<12-16,Phoebe>我该在哪里停下呢
<12-16,Phoebe>When should I have stopped?

343
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:19,930
<12-17,Ross>也许就因为美国没有五十个州  所以才这么难
<12-17,Ross>Okay, maybe this is so hard because there aren't 50 states.

344
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:25,240
<12-17,Ross>我得告诉你一件事我写出四十九个州的州名
<12-17,Ross>Let me tell you something. I have 49 states...

345
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,530
<12-17,Ross>没有其他州了
<12-17,Ross>...and there are no more!

346
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,810
<12-17,Ross>我想我应该可以吃点东西了
<12-17,Ross>I think I should be able to eat something.

347
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,040
<12-18,Chandler>随便你
<12-18,Chandler>It's up to you.

<12-20,Tag>我得到警局去  指认嫌犯的照片
<12-20,Tag>I gotta go down to the police station and look at mug shots.

<12-22,Tag>谢谢你邀请我来这里
<12-22,Tag>Thanks for having me over.

<12-23,Ross>Tag, you're going?

352
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:51,830
<12-23,Ross>我们还没有机会好好谈一谈
<12-23,Ross>We didn't even get a chance to talk.

353
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,460
<12-23,Ross>你说你是哪一州的人
<12-23,Ross>So where did you say you're from again?

354
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:57,130
<12-25,Ross>-科罗拉多州  -你真是没用
<12-25,Ross>- Colorado. - What good are you?

355
