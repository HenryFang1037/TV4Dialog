00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,970
<1-3,Joey>嘿  罗斯  瞧我的

5
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:17,740
<1-4,Chandler>你在做什么呢

6
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:19,200
<1-5,Ross>你看过这个吗
<1-5,Ross>Have you seen this?

7
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,420
<1-5,Ross>这是我们大学校友会的新网站
<1-5,Ross>It's our new alumni website for college.

8
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,020
<1-5,Ross>你可以发布状态
<1-5,Ross>You can post messages for people,

9
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:25,320
<1-5,Ross>让大家知道你的近况
<1-5,Ross>let everyone know what you're up to.

10
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,560
<1-6,Chandler>太好了  一个更快速方式
<1-6,Chandler>Oh, great. A faster way to tell people

11
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:29,230
<1-6,Chandler>昭告大家  我失业又没小孩
<1-6,Chandler>that I'm unemployed and childless.

12
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,100
<1-7,Ross>知道大家的近况挺有意思的
<1-7,Ross>It's actually interesting to find out what people are doing.

13
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:34,830
<1-7,Ross>记得艾卓雅·里奇吗
<1-7,Ross>Remember Andrea Rich?

14
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,810
<1-8,Chandler>不肯跟你上床的那个高个子女生吗
<1-8,Chandler>That tall girl that wouldn't sleep with you?

15
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:39,430
<1-9,Ross>她的网络公司倒闭了
<1-9,Ross>Well, her Internet company went under,

16
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,800
<1-9,Ross>还在游艇事故里失去一只耳朵
<1-9,Ross>and she lost an ear in a boating accident.

17
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,990
<1-10,Chandler>我敢说她现在一定会跟你上床了
<1-10,Chandler>Bet she'd sleep with you now.

18
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,730
<1-11,Ross>不行  我已经发邮件问过她了
<1-11,Ross>No, I already e-mailed her.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,510
<1-12,Chandler>让我看看  你给自己写的什么
<1-12,Chandler>Let me see what you wrote about yourself.

20
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:57,010
<1-12,Chandler>古生物学博士  有两个小孩
<1-12,Chandler>Doctor of paleontology, two kids.

21
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,660
<1-12,Chandler>等等  你跟卡罗尔分开的原因
<1-12,Chandler>Wait a second. You split with Carol

22
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,130
<1-12,Chandler>是因为兴趣不同吗
<1-12,Chandler>because you had different interests?

23
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,410
<1-12,Chandler>我认为你跟她分开的原因
<1-12,Chandler>I think you split with Carol

24
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,370
<1-12,Chandler>是因为某个兴趣相同
<1-12,Chandler>because you had one very similar interest.

25
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,530
<1-13,Ross>我等一下再写好了  去拿件外套
<1-13,Ross>I'm gonna finish this later, okay? Let me just grab my coat.

26
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:10,900
<1-14,Joey>好的
<1-14,Joey>Okay!

27
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:17,350
<1-15,Ross>怎样  你花了两分钟就能学会吗
<1-15,Ross>What, did you think you learned how to do it in the last two minutes?

28
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,550
<1-16,Chandler>或许  我们可以帮他写完
<1-16,Chandler>Maybe we finish this for him.

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,370
<1-16,Chandler>同时  我在实验室里克隆出一只恐龙
<1-16,Chandler>Also, I cloned a dinosaur in my lab.

30
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,670
<1-16,Chandler>她现在是我的女朋友了
<1-16,Chandler>She is now my girlfriend.

31
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,640
<1-16,Chandler>我不在乎世俗的眼光
<1-16,Chandler>I don't care what society says,

32
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:42,060
<1-16,Chandler>它给了我最棒的性生活
<1-16,Chandler>it's the best sex I've ever had.

33
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:45,050
<1-16,Chandler>然后  发布
<1-16,Chandler>And send.

34
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,570
<1-17,Joey>不  你怎么能这么对他
<1-17,Joey>No, no-- You can't do that to him.

<1-18,Ross>-好了  我们走  -老兄
<1-18,Ross>- All right, let's go.  - Dude!

36
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:52,230
<1-20,Ross>我想你很清楚的证明了
<1-20,Ross>I think you made it clear you can't be trusted

37
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,150
<1-20,Ross>不能让你在室内碰球
<1-20,Ross>with the ball inside the house.

38
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:03,360
<1-21,Joey>然后  发布
<1-21,Joey>And send.

50
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,720
<2-1,Rachel>嘿  篮球打得怎么样

51
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:47,850

<2-2,Joey>It was fun.

52
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,270
<2-2,Joey>一直玩到钱德勒的眼睛被手指戳到
<2-2,Joey>Right up until Chandler got a finger in the eye.

53
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,030
<2-3,Rachel>哦  天啊  是谁弄的
<2-3,Rachel>Oh, no! Who did that?

54
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,450
<2-3,Rachel>钱德勒自己
<2-3,Rachel>Chandler. Yeah.

55
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,450
<2-4,Joey>嘿

56
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,090
<2-4,Joey>-瑞秋  -怎样
<2-4,Joey>- Rach?  - Yeah?

57
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,280
<2-4,Joey>哈格吉为什么会在艾玛的婴儿车里
<2-4,Joey>What's Huggsy doing in the crib with Emma?

58
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,990
<2-5,Rachel>她到处爬的时候看到了
<2-5,Rachel>She was just crawling around and found him,

59
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,580
<2-5,Rachel>所以我就让他们一起睡觉觉
<2-5,Rachel>so I just let her sleep with him.

60
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:11,630
<2-5,Rachel>-没关系吧  -当然  没关系
<2-5,Rachel>- That's all right, isn't it?  - Of course. Yeah.

61
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,560
<2-6,Joey>只是填充玩具而已
<2-6,Joey>It's a stuffed animal, you know?

62
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,980
<2-6,Joey>是给小孩玩的  不是给大人的
<2-6,Joey>It's for kids. Not for adults.

63
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:17,990
<2-6,Joey>这点我知道
<2-6,Joey>I know that.

64
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:21,850
<2-7,Rachel>乔伊  你确定吗  我知道你很爱他
<2-7,Rachel>Joey, you're sure? I mean, I know how much you love him.

65
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,750
<2-8,Joey>瑞秋  我们说清楚
<2-8,Joey>Rachel, let's be clear on this, okay?

66
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,370
<2-8,Joey>我没有很爱他
<2-8,Joey>I do not love Huggsy.

67
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,360
<2-8,Joey>我只是以正常的程度喜欢他
<2-8,Joey>I like him a normal amount.

68
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:33,910
<2-9,Rachel>好吧  但是艾玛爱死他了
<2-9,Rachel>All right. Well, Emma loves him.

69
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:36,450
<2-10,Joey>是啊  能不爱嘛  他那么好
<2-10,Joey>Yeah. Well, why wouldn't she? He's a wonderful person!

70
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,990
<3-2,Monica>-嗨  -嘿  菲比  你还好吗
<3-2,Monica>- Hi.  - Hey, Phoebe. How you doing?

71
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:48,740
<3-3,Phoebe>-你感觉好点了吗  -分手真是难受
<3-3,Phoebe>- You feeling better?  - Breaking up sucks.

72
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:52,150
<3-3,Phoebe>-我真的好想迈克  -真遗憾
<3-3,Phoebe>- Oh, I really miss Mike.  - Oh, I'm so sorry.

73
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,380
<3-5,Phoebe>我已经试过所有疗伤法了
<3-5,Phoebe>I've tried everything to feel better.

74
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,920
<3-5,Phoebe>甚至还想要写首歌
<3-5,Phoebe>I even tried writing a song about it...

75
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,330
<3-5,Phoebe>但是我不想出任何韵律  可以配这个调的
<3-5,Phoebe>but I can't think of anything that rhymes with:

76
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,740
<3-5,Phoebe>莫妮卡  我需要你帮我渡过这段时期
<3-5,Phoebe>Hey, Monica, I'm gonna need your help getting through this.

77
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:07,950
<3-6,Chandler>你不需要我帮忙吗
<3-6,Chandler>You're saying you're not gonna need my help?

78
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,090
<3-7,Phoebe>暂不  当我准备好
<3-7,Phoebe>No. When I get to the point where I'm ready...

79
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,920
<3-7,Phoebe>要听糗死迈克笑话时
<3-7,Phoebe>...to hear cruel, mocking jokes about Mike,

80
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:13,160
<3-7,Phoebe>我会来找你的
<3-7,Phoebe>I'm gonna come to you.

81
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,700
<3-8,Chandler>很好  因为我已经想出三个了
<3-8,Chandler>Oh, good, because I've already thought of three.

82
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,050
<3-8,Chandler>四个  我刚刚又想出第四个
<3-8,Chandler>Four! I just thought of a fourth!

83
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:21,750
<3-9,Phoebe>好了  我知道我的决定是正确的
<3-9,Phoebe>Okay. I mean, I know I did the right thing.

84
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,520
<3-9,Phoebe>迈克再也不想结婚
<3-9,Phoebe>Mike never wants to get married...

85
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:26,170
<3-9,Phoebe>而我也不陷进一段没有未来的感情
<3-9,Phoebe>...and I shouldn't be in a relationship that has no future.

86
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:29,380
<3-9,Phoebe>但没多久  我就会很想他
<3-9,Phoebe>But pretty soon, I'm gonna miss him so much...

87
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,520
<3-9,Phoebe>很想再见到他
<3-9,Phoebe>...I'm gonna want to see him again,

88
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,520
<3-9,Phoebe>到时候你一定要阻止我
<3-9,Phoebe>and you have to stop me.

89
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:33,880
<3-10,Monica>好的  没问题
<3-10,Monica>Okay, you got it.

90
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,860
<3-11,Phoebe>除非… 我是不是太小题大做了
<3-11,Phoebe>Unless.... Am I being too crazy about this?

91
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,120
<3-11,Phoebe>好吧  就算没有未来又如何
<3-11,Phoebe>All right, so there's no future.

92
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:44,250
<3-11,Phoebe>那不表示我们不会快乐啊
<3-11,Phoebe>But that doesn't mean we still can't have fun.

93
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:47,680
<3-11,Phoebe>算了  就当我没说过
<3-11,Phoebe>You know what? Forget what I said.

94
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:48,310
<3-11,Phoebe>真的吗
<3-11,Phoebe>Really?

95
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,780
<3-12,Monica>好吧  如果你想的话
<3-12,Monica>All right, if that's what you want.

96
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,890
<3-13,Phoebe>那是个测试  你没及格
<3-13,Phoebe>That was a test, and you just failed.

97
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:56,180
<3-14,Monica>该死的  新手才会犯的错
<3-14,Monica>Damn it! Rookie mistake!

98
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,180
<3-15,Ross>我和恐龙做爱
<3-15,Ross>I have sex with dinosaurs?

99
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,390
<3-16,Chandler>我好像有所耳闻
<3-16,Chandler>I believe I read that somewhere.

100
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,980
<3-17,Ross>不只不好笑
<3-17,Ross>Not only is it not funny,

101
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:12,860
<3-17,Ross>而且从生理角度上这不可能  好吗
<3-17,Ross>it's physically impossible! Okay?

102
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:13,840
<3-17,Ross>由于物种不同
<3-17,Ross>Depending on the species,

103
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:15,720
<3-17,Ross>我必须要有六尺长的…
<3-17,Ross>I'd have to have a 6-foot-long--

104
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:16,820
<3-17,Ross>这一点儿不好笑
<3-17,Ross>It's not funny!

105
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,010
<3-18,Chandler>对此我保留反对意见
<3-18,Chandler>I respectfully disagree.

106
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,060
<3-19,Ross>你竟然在我的校友主页上
<3-19,Ross>I can't believe you put that

107
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:24,210
<3-19,Ross>写这些东西
<3-19,Ross>on my alumni page.

108
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,450
<3-20,Chandler>谁在乎呢  没人会去看的
<3-20,Chandler>Who cares? Nobody reads those.

109
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:27,150
<3-21,Ross>最好没有
<3-21,Ross>You better hope not...

110
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,620
<3-21,Ross>因为我刚刚看了你主页上发布的消息
<3-21,Ross>...because I just read what you put on your page today.

111
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:30,500
<3-22,Chandler>我没有主页
<3-22,Chandler>I don't have a page.

112
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,810
<3-23,Ross>哦  对此我保留反对意见
<3-23,Ross>Oh, I respectfully disagree!

113
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,900
<4-1,Joey>瞧瞧你  甜美天真的样子
<4-1,Joey>Look at you. All sweet and innocent,

114
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,290
<4-1,Joey>睡得像天使一样
<4-1,Joey>sleeping like an angel.

115
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:58,450
<4-1,Joey>被困在艾玛的肥手里
<4-1,Joey>With Emma's chubby little hands wrapped around you.

116
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,930
<4-1,Joey>没关系  艾玛  你继续睡
<4-1,Joey>It's okay, Emma. You stay asleep.

117
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,820
<4-2,Rachel>不要靠近婴儿床  我有武器
<4-2,Rachel>Step away from the crib! I have a weapon!

118
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:10,980
<4-3,Joey>没关系  瑞秋  是我
<4-3,Joey>It's okay! It's okay, Rach! It's me!

119
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:12,830
<4-3,Joey>快把发卷放下
<4-3,Joey>Put down the scrunchie.

120
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:15,090
<4-4,Rachel>你在干嘛
<4-4,Rachel>What are you doing?

121
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:16,500
<4-5,Joey>我听到艾玛这有声音
<4-5,Joey>Well, I heard Emma stirring...

122
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,540
<4-5,Joey>所以我过来确定一下
<4-5,Joey>...so I came in to make sure

123
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:19,840
<4-5,Joey>让她可以抓到哈格吉
<4-5,Joey>she could reach Huggsy.

124
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,240
<4-6,Rachel>谢谢  反正醒了  我要去上厕所
<4-6,Rachel>Oh, thanks. All right, well, now that I'm up, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

125
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:28,580
<4-7,Joey>好的  拿去  亲爱的
<4-7,Joey>Okay, there you go, sweetie.

126
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:30,490
<4-7,Joey>这事没完
<4-7,Joey>This isn't over!

127
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,150
<5-1,Monica>等等  为什么罗斯要跟班里每个人说
<5-1,Monica>Wait a second. Why would Ross tell everyone in your class

128
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,380
<5-1,Monica>你始终就是个同性恋
<5-1,Monica>that you are ''as gay as the day is long''?

129
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,100
<5-2,Chandler>因为我告诉大家  他跟恐龙上床
<5-2,Chandler>Because I told everyone he slept with dinosaurs.

130
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:50,000

<7-11,Joey>但他们是一样的啊

00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:52,680
<8-20,Monica>不然分手就更难了
<8-20,Monica>It's gonna make getting over each other harder.

248
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:53,910
<8-21,Phoebe>如果我们什么都不做
<8-21,Phoebe>Not if nothing happens.

249
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,800
<8-21,Phoebe>像朋友一样相处不行吗
<8-21,Phoebe>Why can't we just hang out as friends?

250
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,800
<8-22,Monica>当然可以  如果你们只是朋友
<8-22,Monica>Sure. If you're just gonna hang out as friends,

251
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:02,220
<8-22,Monica>那我也可以加入
<8-22,Monica>then maybe I'll join you.

252
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:04,100
<8-22,Monica>我是你的朋友  也是迈克的朋友
<8-22,Monica>You know, I'm your friend and Mike's friend.

253
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:09,490
<8-23,Phoebe>坐下吧
<8-23,Phoebe>Sit down.

254
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,340
<8-24,Monica>给朋友让个位置
<8-24,Monica>Make room for your friend.

255
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:27,360
<8-25,Mike>你过得好不好
<8-25,Mike>So how have you been?

256
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,110
<8-26,Monica>我还挺不错的

257
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,170
<8-27,Mike>你真的很美
<8-27,Mike>You look really beautiful.

00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:38,100
<8-28,Phoebe>谢谢  你看起来也不错
<8-28,Phoebe>Thanks. You look good too.

259
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:41,860
<8-29,Monica>不对  这太危险了  说话注意点
<8-29,Monica>No, no, no. This is dangerous territory. Keep it clean.

260
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,690
<8-30,Phoebe>钢琴弹得怎么样了
<8-30,Phoebe>So how's the piano playing going?

261
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:48,320
<8-31,Mike>我最近弹了许多情歌
<8-31,Mike>Actually, I've been playing a lot of love songs lately.

262
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:52,390
<8-32,Phoebe>-我好想你  -我也想你
<8-32,Phoebe>- I've missed you.  - I've missed you too.

263
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,500
<8-33,Monica>来这的路上
<8-33,Monica>You know, on the way over here,

264
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:00,190
<8-33,Monica>我看到一个酒鬼吐了一地
<8-33,Monica>I saw this drunk guy throw up.

265
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,060
<8-33,Monica>然后一只鸽子还去吃
<8-33,Monica>And then a pigeon ate it.

266
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,670
<8-33,Monica>嘿  罗斯
<8-33,Monica>Hey. Ross.

267
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:13,210
<9-1,Chandler>听着  我想跟你道歉
<9-1,Chandler>Look, I just wanted to apologize.

268
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,400
<9-1,Chandler>别告诉我  你真的在做我的同志照
<9-1,Chandler>Don't tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me.

269
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,070
<9-2,Ross>瞧瞧这个
<9-2,Ross>Check this out.

270
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:23,150
<9-3,Chandler>原来如果我有健身  就是这样的啊
<9-3,Chandler>So that's what I'd look like if I worked out.

271
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:26,960
<9-3,Chandler>而且还是警察先生为我服务
<9-3,Chandler>And was being serviced by a policeman.

272
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,520
<9-3,Chandler>你不会真的发出去吧
<9-3,Chandler>You're not gonna actually send these out, are you?

273
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:34,320
<9-4,Ross>不会了  因为你"罗斯死了" 的笑话
<9-4,Ross>Actually, I don't need to, because your little ''Ross is dead'' joke

274
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:35,030
<9-4,Ross>根本没效果
<9-4,Ross>didn't work.

275
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,960
<9-4,Ross>好吗  根本就没有人回应
<9-4,Ross>Okay? There were no responses.

276
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:38,700
<9-4,Ross>网上没人发布任何东西
<9-4,Ross>Nobody posted anything on the website,

277
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:39,790
<9-4,Ross>没人打电话给我父母
<9-4,Ross>nobody called my parents,

278
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,760
<9-4,Ross>该笑话你才对
<9-4,Ross>so the joke is on you.

279
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:44,000
<9-4,Ross>没人打电话  没人写信
<9-4,Ross>Nobody called, nobody wrote anything,

280
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,860
<9-4,Ross>没人在乎我死了
<9-4,Ross>nobody cares that I'm dead.

281
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:52,040
<9-4,Ross>哦  我的天啊
<9-4,Ross>Oh, my God.

282
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:54,420
<9-4,Ross>没有人在乎我死了吗
<9-4,Ross>Nobody cares that I'm dead?

283
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:56,390
<9-5,Chandler>哦  别这样  你知道不是那样的
<9-5,Chandler>Oh, come on, you know that's not true.

284
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,890
<9-6,Ross>说什么  你不过发布个出柜的消息
<9-6,Ross>What are you talking about? You get 60 responses...

285
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,780
<9-6,Ross>就有六十个回复
<9-6,Ross>just for coming out of the closet.

286
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:04,000
<9-6,Ross>我连一个回复都没有  我可是死了
<9-6,Ross>I didn't get one response, and I'm dead!

287
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:07,830
<9-7,Chandler>嗯  同志社团比死人社团话多
<9-7,Chandler>Well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community.

288
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:12,690
<9-8,Ross>不敢相信  连我地质学搭档都没有回复
<9-8,Ross>I can't believe this. Not even my geology lab partner.

289
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,470
<9-8,Ross>以前都是我罩他的
<9-8,Ross>And I carried that guy!

290
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,980
<9-9,Chandler>我们重新想一下  好吧
<9-9,Chandler>Look, let's think about this, okay?

291
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:19,200
<9-9,Chandler>大家在这悲伤的时刻
<9-9,Chandler>You think people are gonna disturb your family

292
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,290
<9-9,Chandler>忍心打扰你的家人吗
<9-9,Chandler>at this tragic time?

293
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:23,360
<9-9,Chandler>有人会在网站上张贴哀悼辞吗
<9-9,Chandler>That people are gonna post condolences on a website?

294
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:25,450
<9-9,Chandler>不是说大家不在乎
<9-9,Chandler>This isn't about people not caring.

295
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:29,660
<9-9,Chandler>而是没有合适的渠道悼念
<9-9,Chandler>This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief.

296
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:33,220
<9-10,Ross>-说的对  的确没有合适的渠道  -没错
<9-10,Ross>- You're right. There isn't a decent outlet.  - Right.

297
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:36,930
<9-11,Chandler>你要是办追悼会   我肯定很多人会来的
<9-11,Chandler>I'm sure if you had a funeral or memorial service, tons of people would come.

298
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:39,940
<9-12,Ross>就是这样
<9-12,Ross>Exactly!

299
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,580
<9-12,Ross>罗斯  你要干嘛
<9-12,Ross>Ross, what are you doing?

300
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:46,650
<9-13,Chandler>你要帮自己办追悼会
<9-13,Chandler>You're having a memorial service for yourself?

301
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:50,310
<9-14,Ross>不  那得多傻  是你帮我办的
<9-14,Ross>No, that would be stupid. You're having it for me.

302
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:52,910
<9-15,Chandler>罗斯  不要发出去  不要发…
<9-15,Chandler>Ross, don't press send. Don't press--

303
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,860
<9-16,Ross>不  太迟了  已经发了
<9-16,Ross>No, too late. Too late. It's sent.

304
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:58,320
<9-16,Ross>对不起  还有你跟警察先生的照片
<9-16,Ross>Sorry, so is that picture of you and the policeman.

305
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,890
<10-1,Rachel>我刚要哄艾玛睡一下
<10-1,Rachel>I'm trying to put Emma down for a nap.

306
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:03,940
<10-1,Rachel>你有看到哈格吉吗
<10-1,Rachel>Have you seen Huggsy?

307
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:05,700
<10-2,Joey>原版的还是不好的那个
<10-2,Joey>Original or crappy?

308
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,950
<10-4,Joey>-原版的  -没有  抱歉  没有看到
<10-4,Joey>- Original.  - No. Sorry. Haven't seen him.

309
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:12,290
<10-5,Rachel>那你床单下面那个鼓包是什么
<10-5,Rachel>Then what's that big lump under your covers?

310
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:15,580
<10-6,Joey>是莫妮卡  行了吗
<10-6,Joey>It's Monica, okay?

311
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:17,730
<10-7,Rachel>那才不是莫妮卡
<10-7,Rachel>That's not Monica!

312
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:20,330
<10-8,Joey>好啦  没关系  是原版的哈格吉
<10-8,Joey>All right, fine! It's original Huggsy!

313
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:24,170
<10-8,Joey>我知道艾玛要他
<10-8,Joey>I know Emma wants him,

314
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,490
<10-8,Joey>但他是我的  而我需要他
<10-8,Joey>but he's mine and I need him.

315
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,090
<10-10,Joey>她真不讲理
<10-10,Joey>She's being unreasonable.

316
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,590
<10-11,Rachel>乔伊  艾玛爱那个蠢企鹅是有原因的
<10-11,Rachel>Joey, there is a reason that Emma loves that stupid penguin so much!

317
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,060
<10-11,Rachel>别捂他耳朵
<10-11,Rachel>Oh, don't cover its ears!

318
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:38,550
<10-11,Rachel>因为这会让她想起乔伊叔叔
<10-11,Rachel>It's because it reminds her of her Uncle Joey.

319
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,130
<10-12,Joey>-真的  -当然
<10-12,Joey>- It does?  - Yeah.

320
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:43,260
<10-13,Rachel>她喜欢抱着他
<10-13,Rachel>And she's comforted by him

321
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:46,280
<10-13,Rachel>是因为她是非常爱乔伊叔叔
<10-13,Rachel>because she loves her Uncle Joey so much.

322
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:49,800
<10-14,Joey>-真的  她爱我  -当然啦
<10-14,Joey>- Really? She loves me?  - Oh, yeah.

323
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:51,530
<10-15,Rachel>但是你知道吗
<10-15,Rachel>But you know what?

324
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,490
<10-15,Rachel>如果你需要哈格吉  没关系
<10-15,Rachel>If you need Huggsy, don't worry.

325
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:56,490
<10-15,Rachel>艾玛会谅解的  我不会  但又怎样
<10-15,Rachel>Emma will totally understand. I won't, but whatever.

326
00:16:56,630 --> 00:17:00,380
<10-16,Joey>好的  等等  瑞秋  我是说如果…
<10-16,Joey>Okay, wait a minute, Rach. I mean, if....

327
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:04,100
<10-16,Joey>如果艾玛那么喜欢哈格吉  那么…
<10-16,Joey>If Huggsy means that much to Emma, then....

328
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,540
<10-16,Joey>嗯  就给她吧
<10-16,Joey>Well, she can have him.

329
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:10,000
<10-17,Rachel>亲爱的  我就知道乔伊叔叔最好了
<10-17,Rachel>Oh, sweet, I knew Uncle Joey would step up.

330
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:12,580
<10-17,Rachel>瞧  艾玛  瞧瞧是谁回来了
<10-17,Rachel>Look, Emma. Look who's back.

331
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:14,070
<10-18,Joey>不  算了  我做不到
<10-18,Joey>No, forget it! Forget it! I can't do it!

332
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:17,310
<10-19,Rachel>你…你要把哈格吉从一个小孩手上抢走
<10-19,Rachel>Are you--? You're gonna take Huggsy away from a little child?

333
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:17,860
<10-20,Joey>要不然你认为
<10-20,Joey>How do you think

334
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,960
<10-20,Joey>我当初怎么拿到哈格吉的
<10-20,Joey>I got him in the first place?

335
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:25,030
<11-1,Monica>好了  你们两个  我要去上厕所
<11-1,Monica>All right, you two. I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

336
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,480
<11-1,Monica>希望我不在的时候  不要发生什么事
<11-1,Monica>I don't want anything going on while I'm gone.

337
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,440
<11-1,Monica>有几件事你们可以讨论
<11-1,Monica>Here's a few things you can discuss:

338
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,090
<11-1,Monica>黏液  真菌  还可以想象我跟罗斯乱搞
<11-1,Monica>Mucus, fungus, and the idea of me and Ross doing it.

339
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,660
<11-1,Monica>我真的好想你
<11-1,Monica>I've missed you so much.

340
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:40,490
<11-2,Mike>我不会要求你复合
<11-2,Mike>I won't ask you to get back together.

341
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,550
<11-2,Mike>我知道我们要的是不同的东西 但…
<11-2,Mike>I know we want different things, but....

342
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:44,490
<11-2,Mike>我只想和你再多待一个晚上
<11-2,Mike>Just to be with you one more night.

343
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,690
<11-3,Phoebe>我也想要
<11-3,Phoebe>I want that too.

344
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,750
<11-3,Phoebe>但是那不是会让我们更痛苦吗
<11-3,Phoebe>But is that gonna make it too hard?

345
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,600
<11-4,Mike>还能比现在更痛苦吗
<11-4,Mike>It can't be any harder than this.

346
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:51,640
<11-4,Mike>如果我知道
<11-4,Mike>I mean, if  had known the last time I saw you

347
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:53,390
<11-4,Mike>上次是见你的最后一面  我…
<11-4,Mike>would be the last time, I--

348
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,240
<11-4,Mike>我会努力记住你的脸
<11-4,Mike>I would have stopped to memorize your face,

349
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:57,580
<11-4,Mike>你的一举一动
<11-4,Mike>the way you moved.

350
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:58,790
<11-4,Mike>你的所有
<11-4,Mike>Everything about you.

351
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,030
<11-4,Mike>如果我知道  上次是最后一次吻你…
<11-4,Mike>If I had known the last time I kissed you would be the last time...

352
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:05,770
<11-4,Mike>那我永远都不会停下来
<11-4,Mike>I never would have stopped.

353
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,700
<11-5,Monica>亲他  你个傻瓜
<11-5,Monica>Kiss him, you fool!

<11-7,Monica>-什么  -你没有听到他说什么吗
<11-7,Monica>- What?  - Didn't you hear that speech?

355
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:15,650
<11-7,Monica>如果你再不亲他  我就上了
<11-7,Monica>If you don't kiss him, then I will.

356
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:18,450
<11-8,Phoebe>我好想你
<11-8,Phoebe>I missed you so much.

<11-12,Mike>我请他看着我  远离你
<11-12,Mike>I asked him to keep me away from you.

360
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:33,290
<11-13,Monica>我也在帮菲比做同样的事
<11-13,Monica>Hey, that's what I'm doing for Phoebe.

361
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,270
<11-14,Manny>看来你做得还真差
<11-14,Manny>Well, you're not doing a very good job.

362
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:38,510
<11-16,Manny>-你说什么  -这个吻怎么回事
<11-16,Manny>- Excuse me?  - What's with the kissing?

363
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,350
<11-17,Monica>至少我知道我管的人在哪儿
<11-17,Monica>Hey, at least I knew where my guy was.

364
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,480
<11-18,Manny>是啊  感谢上帝
<11-18,Manny>Yeah, thank God

365
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:44,550
<11-18,Manny>有你在这里监看他们亲吻
<11-18,Manny>you were here to oversee all the kissing.

366
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,710
<11-19,Monica>你没有听到他说的话
<11-19,Monica>You didn't hear the speech.

367
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:48,530
<11-20,Manny>我听到了
<11-20,Manny>I've heard the speech.

368
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:50,970
<11-20,Manny>如果他知道那是最后一次…
<11-20,Manny>If he knew it was gonna be the last time--

369
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:53,440
<11-21,Monica>那很感人的  是你太无情了
<11-21,Monica>Hey, it was very moving. You're just heartless!

370
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:55,940
<11-22,Manny>-你太软弱了  -你太奇怪了
<11-22,Manny>- You're weak!  -You're weird!

371
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:57,500
<11-24,Manny>你裤子拉链没拉
<11-24,Manny>Your pants are undone.

372
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:02,280
<11-25,Monica>他们呢
<11-25,Monica>Where'd they go?

373
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:06,920
<11-26,Manny>-该死的  -我们搞砸了
<11-26,Manny>- Damn it.  - Well, we blew it.

374
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:09,360
<11-28,Manny>我只能怪我自己
<11-28,Manny>I blame myself.

375
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:11,900
<11-29,Monica>而我也只能怪你
<11-29,Monica>And I blame you too.

376
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,030
<12-1,Ross>已经一个小时了
<12-1,Ross>It's been an hour,

377
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,500
<12-1,Ross>我同学竟然一个都没来
<12-1,Ross>and not one of my classmates has shown up?

378
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:24,190
<12-1,Ross>我告诉你  要是我真的死了
<12-1,Ross>I tell you, when I actually die,

379
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,420
<12-1,Ross>有些人一定会被鬼缠死的
<12-1,Ross>some people are gonna get seriously haunted.

380
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:31,440
<12-2,Chandler>来了  有人来了
<12-2,Chandler>There you go. Someone came.

381
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:33,500
<12-3,Ross>好了  好了  我躲起来了
<12-3,Ross>Okay. Okay. I'm gonna go hide.

382
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,360
<12-3,Ross>太兴奋了  我第一个追悼者
<12-3,Ross>This is so exciting. My first mourner!

383
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,470
<12-4,Monica>嗨  很高兴你能够来
<12-4,Monica>Hi. Glad you could come.

384
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,200
<12-5,Chandler>请进
<12-5,Chandler>Please come in.

385
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,510
<12-6,Tom>你是钱德勒·宾吧
<12-6,Tom>Hi. You're Chandler Bing, right?

386
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,050
<12-6,Tom>我是汤姆·高登  是你班上的同学
<12-6,Tom>I'm Tom Gordon. I was in your class.

387
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,260
<12-7,Chandler>哦  是的  是的  我来帮你拿外套
<12-7,Chandler>Oh, yes. Yes, let me take your coat.

388
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:55,160
<12-8,Tom>谢谢  罗斯的事我很遗憾  真是…
<12-8,Tom>Thanks. I'm so sorry about Ross, it's....

389
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:57,470
<12-9,Chandler>没关系  至少他去世时正在做喜欢的事
<12-9,Chandler>No, at least he died doing what he loved.

390
00:19:58,090 --> 00:19:59,380
<12-9,Chandler>看大胖子
<12-9,Chandler>Watching blimps.

391
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,500
<12-10,Ross>那是谁
<12-10,Ross>Who is it?

392
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:08,400
<12-11,Chandler>你认识一个叫汤姆·高登的吗
<12-11,Chandler>You know some guy, Tom Gordon?

393
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:09,640
<12-12,Ross>我不记得他了
<12-12,Ross>I don't remember him.

394
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:12,720
<12-12,Ross>但是  我启发过太多人了
<12-12,Ross>But then again, I touched so many lives.

395
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:17,700
<12-13,Monica>那你跟罗斯很熟吗
<12-13,Monica>So did you know Ross well?

396
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,960
<12-14,Tom>不算认识
<12-14,Tom>Actually, I barely knew him.

397
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:21,060
<12-14,Tom>我来是因为听到钱德勒的事
<12-14,Tom>I came because I heard Chandler's news.

398
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:22,660
<12-14,Tom>他有对象了吗
<12-14,Tom>Do you know if he's seeing anyone?

399
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,430
<12-15,Monica>是的  他有  就是我
<12-15,Monica>Yes, he is. Me.

400
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,240
<12-15,Monica>什么  你是说…
<12-15,Monica>What? You mean--?

401
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:35,840
<12-16,Tom>我可以问你一个私人问题吗
<12-16,Tom>Can I ask you a personal question?

402
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:38,390
<12-16,Tom>你是怎么把胡子刮得这么干净的
<12-16,Tom>How do you shave your beard so close?

403
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,210
<12-17,Chandler>好了  小汤姆  你哀悼得够了
<12-17,Chandler>Okay, Tommy! That's enough mourning for you.

404
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:45,670
<12-17,Chandler>走吧  再见  好了
<12-17,Chandler>Here we go. Bye-bye. All right.

405
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:49,420
<12-18,Tom>-听着  打电话给我  -好的
<12-18,Tom>- Hey, listen. Call me.  - Okay.

406
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,960
<12-20,Ross>没人关心我的死活吗
<12-20,Ross>I'm dead and no one cares?

407
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,460
<12-21,Monica>我看起来像男人吗
<12-21,Monica>I look like a man?

408
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:00,830
<12-22,Chandler>拜托  荒谬的问题  一次一个就好
<12-22,Chandler>Please, one ridiculous problem at a time.

409
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:03,950
<12-23,Ross>这并不荒谬  你看嘛  根本没有人来
<12-23,Ross>This isn't ridiculous. Look around, no one's here.

410
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,750
<12-24,Chandler>你只给他们一天的时间
<12-24,Chandler>You gave them one day's notice.

411
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,260
<12-24,Chandler>又不是每个人天天都上网
<12-24,Chandler>Not everyone checks the website every day.

412
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:10,500
<12-24,Chandler>而有莫妮卡  或许因为你的站像
<12-24,Chandler>And Monica, it's probably the way you stand!

413
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:13,910
<12-24,Chandler>你说的可能对
<12-24,Chandler>I guess you're right.

414
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,960
<12-25,Ross>但是  总该要有人看到啊
<12-25,Ross>Still, somebody must have seen it.

415
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,530
<12-25,Ross>我在学校上了四年
<12-25,Ross>I went to that school for four years

416
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,230
<12-25,Ross>竟然没有影响到任何人
<12-25,Ross>and I didn't have an impact on anyone?

417
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:23,700
<12-26,Chandler>嗯  不是那样的  你有影响到我啊
<12-26,Chandler>Well, that's not true. You had an impact on me.

418
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,550
<12-26,Chandler>已经十五年了
<12-26,Chandler>I mean, it's 15 years later

419
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,860
<12-26,Chandler>我们依旧是最要好的朋友
<12-26,Chandler>and we're still best friends.

420
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,570
<12-26,Chandler>对你来说  这不算什么吗
<12-26,Chandler>Doesn't that count for something?

421
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:35,990
<12-27,Ross>太好了  更多狂野男孩来找钱德勒了
<12-27,Ross>Oh, great, more party boys for Chandler.

422
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:40,040
<12-28,Chandler>我敢说一定是来看你的  去躲起来
<12-28,Chandler>I'm sure it's somebody for you. Now go hide.

423
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:48,100
<12-29,Kori>嗨  我来参加罗斯·盖勒的追悼会
<12-29,Kori>Hi. I'm here for Ross Geller's memorial service.

424
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:51,910
<12-30,Chandler>-可芮  可芮·薇丝顿  -是的
<12-30,Chandler>- Kori? Kori Weston?  - Yeah.

425
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,990
<12-32,Chandler>-你可真漂亮  -你是谁呢
<12-32,Chandler>- You look amazing.  - And you are?

426
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,160
<12-33,Kori>钱德勒  钱德勒·宾
<12-33,Kori>Chandler. Chandler Bing.

427
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:58,570
<12-34,Chandler>而且我不是同志  我一点都不是
<12-34,Chandler>And I'm not gay. I'm not gay at all.

428
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:00,980
<12-35,Monica>但你是已婚的
<12-35,Monica>You are married, though.

429
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:04,270
<12-36,Chandler>别听这哥们的  他只是心情很差
<12-36,Chandler>Don't listen to him. He's in a really bad mood.

430
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:12,150
<12-37,Kori>我不敢相信罗斯去世了  太难过了
<12-37,Kori>I can't believe that Ross is gone. It is just so sad.

431
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:14,390
<12-38,Chandler>我不知道罗斯跟你很熟
<12-38,Chandler>I didn't know Ross and you were so close.

432
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,860
<12-39,Kori>并没有  但我们一起上过课  他
<12-39,Kori>Oh, we weren't. But we had one class together.

433
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:18,470
<12-39,Kori>是个很棒的人
<12-39,Kori>He was such a great guy.

434
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,540
<12-39,Kori>每次谈到科学都激情四射
<12-39,Kori>And he talked so passionately about science.

435
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,710
<12-39,Kori>我一直记得他
<12-39,Kori>I always remembered him.

436
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:25,790
<12-40,Chandler>我肯定这话对他很重要
<12-40,Chandler>I'm sure that would mean a lot to him.

437
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:27,830
<12-40,Chandler>而且如果天堂有一扇门
<12-40,Chandler>And if heaven has a door...

438
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:31,680
<12-40,Chandler>我敢说  他一定耳朵贴着门专心在听
<12-40,Chandler>...I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently.

439
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,310
<12-41,Kori>我好多次都想打电话约他出去
<12-41,Kori>I thought so many times about calling him and asking him out.

440
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:39,680
<12-41,Kori>大概我再也没有机会了
<12-41,Kori>I guess I really missed my chance.

441
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,640
<12-41,Kori>不  你还有机会
<12-41,Kori>No, you didn't!

442
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,770
<12-42,Ross>我还活着
<12-42,Ross>I'm still alive!

443
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,740
<12-42,Ross>可芮  我知道你很惊讶
<12-42,Ross>Kori, I know this is a big surprise for you.

444
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:51,000
<12-42,Ross>说来话长
<12-42,Ross>It's a long story.

445
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:52,660
<12-42,Ross>但是你刚说的话
<12-42,Ross>But the things you just said

446
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:54,450
<12-42,Ross>让我这一天变得很美好
<12-42,Ross>really made my day.

447
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,720
<12-42,Ross>你能来  对我意义重大
<12-42,Ross>The fact that you're here means more to me...

448
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:59,380
<12-42,Ross>比房间都挤满了人还要好
<12-42,Ross>...than if this room were filled with people.

449
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:02,610
<12-43,Kori>你这变态  谁会做这种事
<12-43,Kori>You sick freak! Who does that?

450
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,330
<12-43,Kori>不敢相信我还喜欢过你
<12-43,Kori>I can't believe I had a crush on you.

451
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:11,030
<12-44,Ross>你们有听到吗
<12-44,Ross>Did you hear that?

452
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,680
<12-44,Ross>可芮·薇丝顿喜欢过我
<12-44,Ross>Kori Weston had a crush on me!

453
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:25,370
<13-1,Ross>没啦  妈  我没死
<13-1,Ross>No, Mom, I am not dead.

454
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:29,700
<13-1,Ross>我知道这种事情不能开玩笑
<13-1,Ross>I know it's not something to kid about.

455
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,990
<13-1,Ross>只是我跟钱德勒之间的恶作剧
<13-1,Ross>It was just a practical joke between Chandler and me,

456
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,660
<13-1,Ross>已经结束了  好吗
<13-1,Ross>but it's over, okay?

457
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:37,580
<13-1,Ross>不会的  即使我死了
<13-1,Ross>Actually, no. Even if I had died,

458
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:39,540
<13-1,Ross>你也不会后继无人的
<13-1,Ross>you would not be left childless.

459
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:42,780
<13-1,Ross>莫妮卡
<13-1,Ross>Monica?
