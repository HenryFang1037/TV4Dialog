1
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,680
<1-2,Ross>-伙计们  你们猜怎么了  -什么
<1-2,Ross>- Guys, guess what? - What?

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,630
<1-3,Monica>我知道时间紧迫  但我们决定要办万圣节派对
<1-3,Monica>I know it's last minute, but we decided to have a Halloween party.

3
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:10,060
<1-4,Phoebe>-很好  -太棒了
<1-4,Phoebe>- Good! - Great!

4
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:13,710
<1-5,Monica>-所有人都得变装  -我没办法参加
<1-5,Monica>- And everybody has to wear costumes. - I can't make it.

5
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,120
<1-5,Monica>少来了  一定会很好玩的
<1-5,Monica>Come on, it'll be fun.

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,910
<1-6,Ross>我会去的
<1-6,Ross>I'll be there.

7
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,510
<1-6,Ross>反正那天上课时我也要变装
<1-6,Ross>I have to wear a costume to my classes that day anyway.

8
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,050
<1-7,Rachel>你不会打扮成恐龙吧
<1-7,Rachel>Tell me you're not gonna dress like a dinosaur.

9
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,520
<1-8,Ross>我怎么会连续两年的扮相一样
<1-8,Ross>Not two years in a row.

10
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,860
<1-9,Joey>我会去的  但我不会变装
<1-9,Joey>I'll come to the party, but I'm not dressing up.

11
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:32,950
<1-10,Monica>你得变装才行
<1-10,Monica>You have to.

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,600
<1-11,Joey>不行  万圣节太愚蠢了
<1-11,Joey>No way. Halloween is so stupid.

13
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,160
<1-11,Joey>变装  假装自己是另一个人
<1-11,Joey>Dressing up, pretending to be someone you're not.

14
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:40,610
<1-12,Chandler>你可是个演员
<1-12,Chandler>You're an actor.

15
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:44,250
<1-13,Monica>罗斯  你会带蒙娜来吗
<1-13,Monica>Ross, are you gonna bring Mona?

16
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,990
<1-14,Ross>我会的
<1-14,Ross>Yeah, I think I will.

17
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:48,020
<1-15,Joey>-你在婚礼上认识的那个漂亮女孩  -对
<1-15,Joey>- The hot girl from their wedding? - Yeah.

18
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:50,380
<1-16,Ross>我给她出几个变装的点子
<1-16,Ross>If she needs any ideas for costumes,

19
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:52,820
<1-17,Joey>她可以扮成比基尼模特
<1-17,Joey>she could be a bikini model...

20
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,620
<1-17,Joey>或风骚护士  或性感啦啦队长
<1-17,Joey>...or a slutty nurse, or a sexy cheerleader.

21
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:59,330
<1-17,Joey>或是《德州电锯杀人狂》里的皮脸
<1-17,Joey>Or Leatherface from Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

22
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:02,860
<1-17,Joey>不  还是风骚的皮脸好了
<1-17,Joey>No, no, no! Slutty Leatherface.

23
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,320
<1-18,Phoebe>乔伊不是也在婚礼上跟她眉来眼去的吗
<1-18,Phoebe>Now, wasn't Joey hitting on her at the wedding too?

24
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,210
<1-19,Ross>没错  他确实对她有意思
<1-19,Ross>That's right, he was hitting on her.

25
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:14,500
<1-19,Ross>而我把到了她  我猜最优质的男人才能赢
<1-19,Ross>And I got her. I guess the better man won.

26
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,490
<1-19,Ross>拜托  别把她抢走
<1-19,Ross>Please don't take her from me.

38
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:01,950
<1-19,Ross>厄休拉
<1-19,Ross>Ursula!

00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,900
<2-1,Phoebe>等一下  是我  菲比
<2-1,Phoebe>Wait. It's me, Phoebe.

40

<2-2,Ursula>I thought there was a mirror there. Okay. Bye.

41
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,500
<2-3,Phoebe>等一下
<2-3,Phoebe>Wait a second!

00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,220
<2-3,Phoebe>你最近有什么情况
<2-3,Phoebe>So, what's new with you?

43
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:17,020
<2-4,Ursula>没什么  下星期我就要结婚了
<2-4,Ursula>Nothing. I'm getting married next week.

44
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,100
<2-5,Phoebe>什么
<2-5,Phoebe>What?

45
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:21,700
<2-6,Ursula>婚礼很简单  我们只邀请家人观礼
<2-6,Ursula>It'll be a small ceremony. Just family.

46
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,470

<2-8,Ursula>Wait. If you want to come,

50
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,930
<2-8,Ursula>我猜应该没关系
<2-8,Ursula>I guess that'd be okay.

51
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:35,140
<2-9,Phoebe>-真的吗  -当然
<2-9,Phoebe>- Really? - Sure.

52
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:37,470
<2-10,Ursula>你可以当我"那一天"的妹妹

<2-12,Ursula>我今晚要去餐馆上班

<3-3,Rachel>买心爱洋装的女人
<3-3,Rachel>on a dress she wants to wear...

65
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:21,290

<3-62,Eric>你妈妈在这里吗  我可以打她的屁股
<3-62,Eric>Uh, is your mother here? Maybe I can give her a little slap on the butt.

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,730
<3-64,Eric>跟你说话的功夫  汗还在不断往外冒
<3-64,Eric>Now I'm saying, "Look at me," I'm getting even sweatier.

00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:26,970
<3-75,Phoebe>也比三年级好
<3-75,Phoebe>and definitely better than third grade.

153
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:29,890
<3-75,Phoebe>三年级的尔虞我诈  勾心斗角
<3-75,Phoebe>With all the politics and the mind games.

<3-87,Joey>-当然是猫女  -是吧
<3-87,Joey>- Catwoman, hands down. - Yeah.

164
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:12,490
<3-89,Joey>但你跟菲比  我赌菲比会赢
<3-89,Joey>Between you and Phoebe ? I'd give the edge to Phoebe.

165
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,920
<3-90,Monica>-什么  真的吗  -你开什么玩笑
<3-90,Monica>- What? Really? - You kidding?

<3-91,Joey>菲比在街上混过  好吗
<3-91,Joey>Phoebe lived on the street, okay?

167
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:19,530
<3-91,Joey>而且她生起气来跟疯婆子一样
<3-91,Joey>Plus, she's got a crazy temper.

168
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,930
<3-91,Joey>她没有站在我后面吧
<3-91,Joey>She's not right behind me, is she?

169
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,000
<3-92,Monica>不  你很安全

<3-94,Monica>用拳打我这里  用全力
<3-94,Monica>Punch me right here, as hard as you can!

173
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:36,790
<3-95,Joey>别激动  你为什么这么当真呢
<3-95,Joey>Will you relax?! What are you taking this so seriously for?

174
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:39,070
<3-95,Joey>-那不重要  -真的吗
<3-95,Joey>- It doesn't matter. - Really?

175
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:43,090
<3-96,Monica>如果我说罗斯或钱德勒能打倒你呢
<3-96,Monica>What if I told you Ross or Chandler could beat you up?

176
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,080
<3-97,Joey>我会说"姑娘  别闹了"
<3-97,Joey>I would say, "Woman, please."

<3-98,Phoebe>通常我不喜欢爱流汗的男人
<3-98,Phoebe>Normally, I don't like sweaty guys.

180
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:59,580
<3-98,Phoebe>但我愿意帮他擦汗
<3-98,Phoebe>But I could just mop him up.

181
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:02,810
<3-99,Monica>-天啊  菲比  -怎么了
<3-99,Monica>- Oh, my God, Phoebe? - What?

276
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,660
<8-1,Monica>你强大的内心才是我最看重的
<8-1,Monica>It's the strength you have inside that means the most to me.

<8-1,Monica>你既忠心又老实  而且还为人正直

<9-3,Phoebe>You know, the only reason he's marrying you

282
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,130
<9-4,Ursula>是因为他以为你说的话都是真的
<9-4,Ursula>is because he thinks the things you were saying were true.

283
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:25,000
<9-5,Phoebe>-有可能是真的  -但你在说慌

<9-30,Ross>蒙娜就站在那里

<9-46,Phoebe>我不能让你这么被骗下去了  她在说谎
<9-46,Phoebe>Okay, I can't let you do this. She's lying to you.

335
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:32,490
<9-48,Phoebe>好吧  不是祈祷团
<9-48,Phoebe>Okay. Yeah, not a prayer chain.

<9-48,Phoebe>但看起来像是银行的平面图
<9-48,Phoebe>But what looks like a detailed drawing of a bank floor plan.

337
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:42,780
<9-48,Phoebe>这是她在餐厅当女服务生的名牌
<9-48,Phoebe>Okay, here's the name tag from where she works as a waitress.

338
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:45,000
<9-48,Phoebe>她不是老师  是女服务生
<9-48,Phoebe>Not a teacher, a waitress.

339
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,850
<9-48,Phoebe>这是她的驾照
<9-48,Phoebe>All right, here's her driver license,

340
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:48,800
<9-48,Phoebe>她总是在年龄上撤慌
<9-48,Phoebe>this oughta be good, she always lies about this.

341
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:52,330
<9-49,Eric>-她跟你说她几岁了  -她说自己25岁
<9-49,Eric>- How old did she say she was? - She told me she was 25.

<9-50,Phoebe>记住  我比她年轻一分钟
<9-50,Phoebe>Just remember, I'm a minute younger.

344
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:04,010
<9-51,Eric>我太笨了
<9-51,Eric>I am so stupid.

345
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:06,220
<9-51,Eric>她当然是在撒谎
<9-51,Eric>Of course she was lying!

346
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:07,970
<9-51,Eric>她不是老师  根本就没有

00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:16,760
<9-52,Phoebe>不  你不笨
<9-52,Phoebe>No, you're not stupid.

349
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,190
<9-53,Eric>我也不聪明
<9-53,Eric>I'm not smart.

350
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:28,140
<9-53,Eric>我只是想冲动一把
<9-53,Eric>I just wanted so much to be impulsive for once.

351
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:29,920
<9-53,Eric>找点浪漫
<9-53,Eric>To be romantic.

352
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:32,730
<9-54,Phoebe>很好  你想要冲动跟浪漫  这样没错
<9-54,Phoebe>That's good. You should be impulsive and you should be romantic.

353
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:36,130
<9-54,Phoebe>只是你找错了对象
<9-54,Phoebe>Just... you did it with the wrong person.

354
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:42,630
<9-55,Eric>-什么  -真的很奇怪  你们长得那么像
<9-55,Eric>- What? - It's weird, two people look so much alike.

355
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:44,420
<9-55,Eric>心地却完全不同
<9-55,Eric>And so different.
