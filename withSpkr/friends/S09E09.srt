<1-10,Joey>Maybe Michael Jordan will dive for the ball

16
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:48,480
<1-10,Joey>然后用他的膝盖撞断我的下巴
<1-10,Joey>and break my jaw with his knee!

<1-11,Chandler>真是太酷了  我来告诉莫妮卡

22
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:01,890
<1-14,Monica>但是明晚是我唯一
<1-14,Monica>But tomorrow night's the only night

23
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:03,110
<1-14,Monica>不用上班的晚上
<1-14,Monica>I get off from the restaurant.

24
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,160
<1-14,Monica>如果你去看球赛
<1-14,Monica>If you go to the game,

00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,380
<1-14,Monica>我们会有一星期没有办法在一起
<1-14,Monica>we won't have a night together for another week.

<1-15,Chandler>但是亲爱的  那是场边座位
<1-15,Chandler>But honey,it's courtside!

00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:09,420
<1-15,Chandler>啦啦队就在正前
<1-15,Chandler>The cheerleaders will be right in..

28
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,990
<1-15,Chandler>这样可不能说服你
<1-15,Chandler>That's not the way to convince you.

29
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,680
<1-16,Monica>我不想要成为那种老婆  老是说
<1-16,Monica>I don't wanna be one of those wives that says:

30
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:18,760
<1-16,Monica>"你不能去看球赛  你要陪我"
<1-16,Monica>"You can't go to the game. You have to spend time with me."

31
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:21,290
<1-16,Monica>所以如果你自己能够意识到
<1-16,Monica>So if you could just realize it on your own..

32
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,890
<1-17,Chandler>我知道  你说的对
<1-17,Chandler>I know. You're right.

<1-17,Chandler>我也想要见到你
<1-17,Chandler>I wanna see you too.

34
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,750
<1-17,Chandler>我得要想想怎么告诉乔伊
<1-17,Chandler>I gotta figure out a way to tell Joey.

00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,160
<1-17,Chandler>他是满心期待着
<1-17,Chandler>He's looking forward to this.

36

<1-18,Monica>告诉他你很久没有见到老婆了
<1-18,Monica>Tell him you haven't seen your wife in a long time.

37
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,960
<1-18,Monica>告诉他长距离关系
<1-18,Monica>Tell him that having a long-distance relationship

38
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,570
<1-18,Monica>是很难维系的
<1-18,Monica>is really difficult.

39
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:38,540
<1-18,Monica>告诉他我们有限的相处时间
<1-18,Monica>Tell him that what little time we have together

40
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,310
<1-18,Monica>是很宝贵的
<1-18,Monica>is precious.

41

104
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,220
<3-5,Chandler>我里面穿的也跟你一样  所以
<3-5,Chandler>I'm wearing the same thing underneath,so..

105
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,200
<3-7,Chandler>你知道我的意思吗
<3-7,Chandler>You see what I mean?

106
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:58,520
<3-8,Joey>嘿  为什么你的门是锁着的
<3-8,Joey>Hey! How come your door's locked?

00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,010
<3-9,Monica>-等一下  -不不不
<3-9,Monica>- Just a second! - No,no,no!

108
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:01,950
<3-9,Monica>不能让乔伊看到我在这里
<3-9,Monica>Joey can't know I'm here.

109
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:02,500
<3-10,Monica>为什么不能
<3-10,Monica>Why not?

110
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,480
<3-11,Chandler>因为我不知道怎么告诉他
<3-11,Chandler>Because I didn't know how to tell him that

111
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,610
<3-11,Chandler>我不能去看尼克斯队的球赛
<3-11,Chandler>I couldn't go to the Knicks game..

112
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:07,260
<3-11,Chandler>所以我跟他说我要留在塔尔萨
<3-11,Chandler>so I told him I had to stay in Tulsa.

113
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,610
<3-12,Monica>所以你跟他说谎
<3-12,Monica>So you lied to him?

114
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:12,480
<3-13,Chandler>说谎比费口舌解释要好太多了
<3-13,Chandler>It's always better to lie than to have the complicated discussion.

115
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,810
<3-13,Chandler>除了跟你之外
<3-13,Chandler>Except with you.

116
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:20,210
<3-14,Joey>嘿  开门  是怎么回事
<3-14,Joey>Hey,open the door! What's going on?

117
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,930
<3-14,Joey>-你在干么  -嗨
<3-14,Joey>- What are you..? - Hi.

118
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,630
<3-15,Joey>你为什么穿成这样呢
<3-15,Joey>Why are you dressed like that?

119
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:32,780
<3-16,Monica>因为钱德勒几天以后就要回来了
<3-16,Monica>Because Chandler's gonna be home in a couple of days..

120
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,320
<3-16,Monica>所以我觉得自己可以...
<3-16,Monica>so I thought I would just,

121
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,470
<3-16,Monica>先  练习一下妩媚的技巧
<3-16,Monica>you know,practice the art of seduction.

122
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,160
<3-17,Joey>我刚刚好像听到有男人的声音
<3-17,Joey>I thought I heard a man's voice before.

123
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,090
<3-18,Monica>没有  我只是在扮钱德勒说话
<3-18,Monica>No,I was just doing Chandler's side of the conversation.

124
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:42,680
<3-18,Monica>你知道的  就像是
<3-18,Monica>You know,like,

125
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,210
<3-18,Monica>"嗨  我看起来如何"
<3-18,Monica>"Hi,how do I look?"

126
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:47,900
<3-18,Monica>"真性感  我还能比现在更性奋吗"
<3-18,Monica>"Really sexy. Could I be any more turned on?"

127
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:48,680
<3-18,Monica>明白吗
<3-18,Monica>You know?

128
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,950
<3-19,Joey>好的  等一下

00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,180
<3-36,Chandler>有那个必要吗
<3-36,Chandler>Is that really necessary?

<4-2,Ross>Although,it's actually a lager.

164
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,100
<4-3,Mike>那普通啤酒跟窖藏啤酒有什么不同呢

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,250
<5-1,Phoebe>坐在一起讨论你跟罗斯的事吗
<5-1,Phoebe>sitting around talking about you and Ross?

<5-4,Rachel>我是说  好长时间都无事发生
<5-4,Rachel>I mean,for a long time,nothing.

175
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:40,640
<5-4,Rachel>但是  事实上  就在你来接我之前
<5-4,Rachel>But you know,actually,right before you picked me up..

176
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:43,370
<5-4,Rachel>罗斯跟我有个小小的"火花"
<5-4,Rachel>Ross and I had a little thing.

00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:50,350
<5-6,Rachel>他先是告诉我  他喜欢我的样子
<5-6,Rachel>Well,first he told me he liked how I looked.

180
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:53,360
<5-6,Rachel>然后我们来了个小小的
<5-6,Rachel>And then we had a little..

181
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,450
<5-7,Phoebe>眼神接触
<5-7,Phoebe>eye contact.

182
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,090
<5-7,Phoebe>眼神接触

<5-10,Rachel>这些是吧台最后那两位先生请的
<5-10,Rachel>these are from the two gentlemen at the end of the bar.

186
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,900
<5-10,Rachel>我们应该回请他们什么的吗
<5-10,Rachel>Should we send them something back?

187
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,690
<5-11,Phoebe>我们请他们吃土豆泥好了
<5-11,Phoebe>Let's send them mashed potatoes!

<5-12,Rachel>不  等等  别那么做
<5-12,Rachel>No,wait! Don't do that!

189
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,720
<5-12,Rachel>那样他们就会认为他们可以过来
<5-12,Rachel>That'll make them think they can come over.

190
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,900
<5-13,Phoebe>所以呢  过来又如何呢
<5-13,Phoebe>So,what if they do?

191
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:20,650
<5-14,Rachel>我们不是来这里钓男人的
<5-14,Rachel>We're not here to meet guys.

00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,270
<5-15,Phoebe>只是玩玩而已
<5-15,Phoebe>We're just having fun.

195
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:33,510
<5-15,Phoebe>不是每件事都得发展到眼神接触地步的
<5-15,Phoebe>You know,not everything has to go as far as eye contact.

196
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,190
<6-1,Monica>钱德勒  你得告诉乔伊

<6-2,Chandler>Isn't it better for him to think you're cheating on me..

199
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,400
<6-2,Chandler>总比他认为我在欺骗他好吧
<6-2,Chandler>than for him to think I'm cheating on him?

00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,240
<6-4,Chandler>好了  我有个计划

00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,360
<7-17,Phoebe>那罗斯怎么办  你们的小火花呢
<7-17,Phoebe>But what about Ross? What about your moment?

248
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,330
<7-17,Phoebe>-你不想跟他谈谈吗  -不想
<7-17,Phoebe>- Don't you wanna talk to him? - No.

249
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,790
<7-18,Rachel>不想  因为我非常清楚
<7-18,Rachel>No,because I know exactly

250
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:24,640
<7-18,Rachel>谈话的结果会是怎样
<7-18,Rachel>how the conversation's gonna go.

251
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:26,110
<7-18,Rachel>"嘿  罗斯
<7-18,Rachel>"Hey,Ross,you know,

252
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:27,840
<7-18,Rachel>我觉得我们刚刚有点小火花"
<7-18,Rachel>I think we had a moment before."

253
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:31,320
<7-18,Rachel>"是啊  我也这么认为"
<7-18,Rachel>"Yeah. Me too."

254
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:33,050
<7-17,Phoebe>"但是我不太确定
<7-17,Phoebe>"Well,but I'm not sure

255
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:34,850
<7-17,Phoebe>我是不是想再更进一步"
<7-17,Phoebe>I really want to do anything about it."

256
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:38,190
<7-17,Phoebe>"是啊  我也不确定"
<7-17,Phoebe>"Yeah. Me neither."

257
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,120
<7-18,Rachel>我们是不是就住在一起
<7-18,Rachel>"Should we just live together..

258
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,360
<7-18,Rachel>然后不要告诉彼此  我们互相的感受
<7-18,Rachel>and not tell each other how we're feeling?"

259
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:45,470
<7-19,Phoebe>"是啊  我没意见"
<7-19,Phoebe>"Yeah,that works for me."

260
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,140
<7-19,Phoebe>是啊  我懂你的意思
<7-19,Phoebe>Yeah,I see what you mean.

261
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:52,570
<7-19,Phoebe>对了  你模仿罗斯真像
<7-19,Phoebe>By the way,nice Ross imitation.

262
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,300
<7-21,Phoebe>但你模仿的瑞秋不够爱发牢骚
<7-21,Phoebe>Your Rachel wasn't whiny enough.

263
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:55,980
<7-21,Phoebe>-嗯嘿  -好多了
<7-21,Phoebe>- Well.. Hey! - Better.

264
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:01,310
<7-22,Rachel>重点是我或许应该停止等待
<7-22,Rachel>The point is maybe I should just stop waiting around

265
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:02,570
<7-22,Rachel>跟罗斯之间的小火花
<7-22,Rachel>for moments with Ross.

266
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,950
<7-22,Rachel>我是说  我要继续过我自己的生活了
<7-22,Rachel>You know? I should just move on with my life.

267
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:08,420
<7-23,Phoebe>真的  你要放弃罗斯了
<7-23,Phoebe>So really,you're moving on from Ross?

268
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:11,560
<7-24,Rachel>我不知道  我得现在就做决定吗
<7-24,Rachel>I don't know. Do I have to decide right now?

269
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:13,440
<7-25,Phoebe>你好像已经做了
<7-25,Phoebe>You kind of just did.

270
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,700
<7-25,Phoebe>那男的今晚会打电话给你
<7-25,Phoebe>That guy is gonna call you tonight.

271
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,360
<7-26,Rachel>罗斯会接起电话
<7-26,Rachel>Ross will pick up the phone,

272
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,860
<7-25,Phoebe>那传达的讯息已经很明显了
<7-25,Phoebe>and that's a pretty clear message.

273
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:19,760
<7-25,Phoebe>噢  天啊  罗斯
<7-25,Phoebe>Oh,my God,Ross!

274
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:22,060
<7-26,Rachel>罗斯会接起电话
<7-26,Rachel>Ross is gonna pick up the phone.

275
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,980
<7-26,Rachel>我得拿回我的电话号码
<7-26,Rachel>I have to get my number back.

276
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:25,260
<7-26,Rachel>噢  天啊  他走了
<7-26,Rachel>Oh,my God,he's gone!

277
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:27,120
<7-26,Rachel>"我得拿回我的电话号码
<7-26,Rachel>"Oh,I have to get my number back!

278
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,000
<7-26,Rachel>噢  天啊  他走了"模仿的真棒
<7-26,Rachel>Oh,my God! He's gone!" Dead on.

279
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:47,060
<8-1,Ross>-我想我该走了  -这么快吗
<8-1,Ross>- You know,I'm gonna take off. - So soon?

280
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:49,600
<8-2,Mike>-是啊  -好的
<8-2,Mike>- Yeah. - Okay.

281
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:52,290
<8-3,Ross>嗯  谢谢你带啤酒过来
<8-3,Ross>Well,thanks.. Thanks for the beer.

282
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:53,670
<8-4,Mike>你是说窖藏啤酒吧
<8-4,Mike>You mean lager?

283
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:56,130
<8-5,Ross>是啊  快乐时光
<8-5,Ross>Yeah. Good times.

284
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:12,050
<8-6,Mike>-喂  -嘿  麦克  是我
<8-6,Mike>- Hello? - Hey,Mike,it's me.

285
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,150
<8-6,Mike>听着  罗斯在你旁边吗
<8-6,Mike>Listen,is.. Is Ross near you?

286
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,880
<8-7,Mike>不在  我刚走
<8-7,Mike>No,I just left.

287
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:17,610
<8-8,Phoebe>你得再回去
<8-8,Phoebe>Well,you have to go back in.

288
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:23,010
<8-9,Mike>什么  回去  回到时光暂停之地吗
<8-9,Mike>What? Go back? To the land where time stands still?

289
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,350
<8-9,Mike>我很抱歉  亲爱的  但是
<8-9,Mike>I'm so sorry,honey,but..

290
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,890
<8-10,Phoebe>瑞秋把自己的号码给了一个男人
<8-10,Phoebe>Okay,Rachel gave this guy her number..

291
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:30,210
<8-10,Phoebe>她不希望罗斯去接电话
<8-10,Phoebe>and she doesn't want Ross to answer the phone.

292
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:32,630
<8-10,Phoebe>所以你必须拦截他所有的电话
<8-10,Phoebe>So you have to intercept all his calls.

293
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,920
<8-11,Mike>我不能那样做
<8-11,Mike>I can't do that!

294
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:37,120
<8-11,Mike>-他说他不能那样做  -电话给我
<8-11,Mike>- He says he can't do that. - Give me the phone.

295
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,070
<8-12,Rachel>麦克  听着
<8-12,Rachel>Hi,Mike. Hi,listen,

296
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:40,850
<8-12,Rachel>我知道这个要求很过分
<8-12,Rachel>I know that this is a lot to ask,

297
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:42,250
<8-12,Rachel>但是你知道吗  如果你照做
<8-12,Rachel>but you know what? If you do this,

298
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:46,510
<8-12,Rachel>菲比会做一切你想要她做的事
<8-12,Rachel>Phoebe will do anything you want.

299
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,200
<8-12,Rachel>真的  我说得是很下流的事
<8-12,Rachel>Seriously,I'm talking dirty stuff.

300
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,090
<8-12,Rachel>喂
<8-12,Rachel>Hello?

301
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:52,440
<8-13,Phoebe>嗨  我替她道歉
<8-13,Phoebe>Hi,I'm sorry about her.

302
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:54,950
<8-13,Phoebe>但事实上  关于下流的事  她说的没错
<8-13,Phoebe>But actually,she wasn't wrong about the dirty stuff.

303
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,510
<8-14,Mike>好了  我照做
<8-14,Mike>All right,I'll do it.

304
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:03,390
<8-14,Mike>但说真的  能有多下流呢
<8-14,Mike>But really,how much dirtier can it get?

305
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,130
<8-14,Mike>噢  麦克
<8-14,Mike>Oh,Mike.

306
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:10,030
<8-15,Mike>再见
<8-15,Mike>Bye.

307
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:15,800
<8-15,Mike>嘿  老兄
<8-15,Mike>Hey,buddy.

308
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,470
<8-17,Mike>-我可以回来吗  -为什么
<8-17,Mike>- Can I come back in? - Why?

309
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,420
<8-17,Mike>我只是在想  我们
<8-17,Mike>Well,I was just thinking about

310
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:29,130
<8-17,Mike>还有很多东西可以聊
<8-17,Mike>how much more we have to talk about.

311
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:33,680
<8-17,Mike>但是你都走了
<8-17,Mike>But you left.

312
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,820
<9-1,Joey>你倒是挺快的
<9-1,Joey>That didn't take long.

313
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:42,750
<9-1,Joey>你不是说塔尔萨到这里要飞三小时吗
<9-1,Joey>I thought you said Tulsa was,like,a three-hour flight?

314
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:48,170
<9-1,Joey>你忘了把时差算进去了
<9-1,Joey>Well,you're forgetting about the time difference.

315
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,970
<9-2,Chandler>钱德勒  你回来了
<9-2,Chandler>Chandler,you're home!

316
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:03,040
<9-2,Chandler>没错  你老公回来了
<9-2,Chandler>That's right! Your husband's home!

317
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,740
<9-2,Chandler>所以现在性爱派对可以停止了
<9-2,Chandler>So now the sex can stop!

318
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:12,070
<9-3,Monica>你在说什么
<9-3,Monica>What are you saying?

319
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,150
<9-4,Chandler>乔伊说你跟另一个男人在一起
<9-4,Chandler>Joey said you're here with another man!

320
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:16,000
<9-5,Monica>这里根本没有男人
<9-5,Monica>There's no man in here!

321
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,080
<9-5,Monica>你怎么敢这样诬赖我
<9-5,Monica>How dare you accuse me of that!

322
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:22,880
<9-6,Joey>好吧  那或许你不介意
<9-6,Joey>All right. Then maybe you won't mind

323
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,190
<9-6,Joey>我和我的朋友到处看看
<9-6,Joey>if me and my friend take a look around.

324
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:30,780
<9-6,Joey>他在做什么
<9-6,Joey>What's he doing?

325
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:34,520
<9-6,Joey>我把枕头做成人形在床上
<9-6,Joey>I arranged some pillows on the bed to look like a guy.

326
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,710
<9-7,Chandler>卧室没有人
<9-7,Chandler>Bedroom's clear.

327
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:41,000
<9-7,Chandler>不过你们可能需要换新的枕头了
<9-7,Chandler>Although you might need some new pillows.

328
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,300
<9-7,Chandler>好了  那我去检查客房
<9-7,Chandler>All right,well,I'll check the guest room.

329
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:54,210
<9-7,Chandler>我为什么闻到男人的古龙水味
<9-7,Chandler>Why do I smell men's cologne?

330
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,610
<9-7,Chandler>我想那是你的味道
<9-7,Chandler>I think that's you.

331
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:01,850
<9-8,Chandler>噢  对噢
<9-8,Chandler>Oh,yeah.

332
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:04,260
<9-8,Chandler>我刚刚才用杂志磨擦到自己身上
<9-8,Chandler>I rubbed a magazine on myself earlier.

333
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:07,990
<9-8,Chandler>里面没有人  乔伊
<9-8,Chandler>There's nobody here,Joe.

334
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,820
<9-9,Joey>我想也没有
<9-9,Joey>I guess not.

335
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,300
<9-10,Monica>我不敢相信你认为我会有外遇
<9-10,Monica>I can't believe you thought I was cheating.

336
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,640
<9-10,Monica>你要对我道歉
<9-10,Monica>You owe me an apology.

337
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:17,000
<9-11,Joey>你说的对  莫妮卡  我很抱歉
<9-11,Joey>You're right. Monica, I'm so sorry.

338
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:17,960
<9-11,Joey>你是无心之失
<9-11,Joey>It's an honest mistake.

339
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,630
<9-11,Joey>可能发生在任何人身上的  再见
<9-11,Joey>It could happen to anybody. See you.

340
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:22,610
<9-11,Joey>等一下  等一下
<9-11,Joey>Wait a minute,wait a minute.

341
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,660
<9-11,Joey>如果你才刚从塔尔萨回来
<9-11,Joey>If you just got back from Tulsa,

342
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,350
<9-11,Joey>你的行李怎么会比你先到
<9-11,Joey>how did your suitcase beat you here?

343
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,050
<9-11,Joey>我从防火梯爬了下去
<9-11,Joey>I climbed down the fire escape,

344
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:34,020
<9-11,Joey>你就不能把这个藏到衣橱里吗
<9-11,Joey>and you can't put that in the closet?

345
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:40,890
<9-11,Joey>所以  除了发酵过程不同之外
<9-11,Joey>So,with the exception of the fermentation process..

346
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:44,460
<9-11,Joey>啤酒跟麦酒基本上是相同的东西
<9-11,Joey>beer and ale are basically the same thing.

347
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:48,060
<10-1,Mike>真引人入胜  不是吗
<10-1,Mike>Fascinating,isn't it?

348
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,700
<10-2,Ross>或许你应该查一下"引人入胜"的意思
<10-2,Ross>Maybe you should look up "fascinating."

349
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,910
<10-3,Mike>我来接
<10-3,Mike>I'll get it!

350
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:03,650
<10-3,Mike>嗨  罗斯家  我是麦克
<10-3,Mike>Hello? Ross' place. Mike speaking.

351
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:07,290
<10-3,Mike>要找你的
<10-3,Mike>It's for you.

352
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:14,560
<10-3,Mike>我不懂刚刚发生的事
<10-3,Mike>I don't understand what just happened here.

353
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:18,630
<10-3,Mike>是怎么回事
<10-3,Mike>What's going on?

354
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,930
<11-1,Joey>我很抱歉
<11-1,Joey>I'm sorry.

355
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,490
<11-2,Chandler>我跟你说我会留在塔尔萨是因为
<11-2,Chandler>I told you I was in Tulsa because

356
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:24,680
<11-2,Chandler>今晚我想要跟莫妮卡在一起
<11-2,Chandler>I wanted to spend the night with Monica..

357
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:28,240
<11-2,Chandler>我说不清  我以为你会不谅解
<11-2,Chandler>and I didn't know.. I didn't think you'd understand.

358
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:31,060
<11-3,Joey>你以为我笨到会不谅解
<11-3,Joey>You think I'm too dumb to understand

359
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:33,110
<11-3,Joey>老公想要跟老婆在一起吗
<11-3,Joey>a husband needs to be with his wife?

360
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,410
<11-3,Joey>你以为我就像
<11-3,Joey>You think I'm,like..

361
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:41,020
<11-4,Monica>-乔伊  -怎样
<11-4,Monica>- Joey? - Yeah.

362
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,030
<11-5,Joey>我不知道该说什么
<11-5,Joey>I don't know what to say.

363
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:44,570
<11-6,Monica>我们不应该欺骗你的
<11-6,Monica>We shouldn't have lied to you.

364
