61
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:29,270

<3-15,Joey>我不是你的男朋友

00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,520
<3-18,Monica>你是说我很臭吗
<3-18,Monica>Are you saying I smell bad?

66
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:43,480
<3-19,Joey>不是  你有一股青草香
<3-19,Joey>No! No, you smell like a meadow.

<3-21,Chandler>乔伊上次去青草地
<3-21,Chandler>Oh, y'know what? The last time Joey went to a meadow,

00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:55,520
<3-21,Chandler>他老娘被猎人射杀了
<3-21,Chandler>his mother was shot by a hunter.

71
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:15,240
<4-2,Ross>我还是不确定
<4-2,Ross>Yeah, I still don't know.

72
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:18,270
<4-2,Ross>抱歉  我只是想买到理想的沙发
<4-2,Ross>I'm sorry I just wanna make sure that I bought the right couch.

73
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,950
<4-2,Ross>我希望这张沙发能表示
<4-2,Ross>I need a couch that says,

74
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,740
<4-2,Ross>"欢迎你们  小朋友"
<4-2,Ross>"Kids welcome here."

75
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:26,140
<4-2,Ross>同时也能让人觉得  "来我身边吧"
<4-2,Ross>But that also says,  "Come here to me!"

76
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:32,020
<4-3,Rachel>什么  你对小朋友说那种话吗
<4-3,Rachel>What?! You say that to kids?!!

77
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:37,750
<4-4,Ross>不是  "来我身边吧"是对女士们说的
<4-4,Ross>No! No! No! The "Come here to me" is y'know for the ladies.

78
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:43,060
<4-5,Rachel>罗斯  这是张好沙发  但不是神奇沙发
<4-5,Rachel>Ross, honey, it's a nice couch. It's not a magic couch.

84
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:54,550
<4-9,Ross>送货费几乎跟沙发价格一样贵
<4-9,Ross>The delivery charge is almost as much as the couch!

85
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,020
<4-10,Rachel>太荒谬了
<4-10,Rachel>Wait! No, that's ridiculous.

147
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,710
<7-4,Chandler>但假扮警察很严重
<7-4,Chandler>Okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing.

162
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:07,120
<7-16,Chandler>马丁·路德金也这么说还得了
<7-16,Chandler>Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if Martin Luther King had said that?

<7-18,Chandler>你梦到我正在交往的女孩
<7-18,Chandler>You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing?!

<7-18,Chandler>他的女朋友多少次了
<7-18,Chandler>I've dreamt about a girl that he was seeing.

169
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:25,290
<7-18,Chandler>总之我们在谈你的梦
<7-18,Chandler>Anyway we're talking about your dream.

<7-19,Joey>Don't worry, there wasn't any sex in it or anything.

172
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,560
<7-19,Joey>自从发现你们的事后
<7-19,Joey>I haven't dreamt about her like that

173
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:34,000
<7-19,Joey>我就不对她做那种梦了
<7-19,Joey>since I found out about you two--ish.

174
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:40,350
<7-20,Monica>那你梦到什么
<7-20,Monica>What was the dream about?

175
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:42,490
<7-21,Joey>好吧
<7-21,Joey>Well, okay.

176
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:47,290
<7-21,Joey>你是我的女朋友  我们在填字谜
<7-21,Joey>You were my girlfriend and we were doing the crossword puzzle.

177
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,060
<7-21,Joey>就像你们昨晚那样
<7-21,Joey>Y'know like you guys were doing last night.

178
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:52,220
<7-21,Joey>就这样  我爱上莫妮卡了  我会搬走
<7-21,Joey>So, that's it. I'm in love with Monica and I'll be moving out.

179
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:53,930
<7-22,Monica>乔伊  等等
<7-22,Monica>Wait, Joey! Joey!

180
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:56,700
<7-22,Monica>那并不代表你爱我
<7-22,Monica>That doesn't mean that-that you're in love with me!

181
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:58,240
<7-23,Joey>不是吗
<7-23,Joey>It-it doesn't?

182
00:09:58,290 --> 00:09:59,370
<7-24,Monica>可能有很多含义
<7-24,Monica>No, it can mean anything.

183
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:01,520
<7-25,Chandler>例如  你突然眼红
<7-25,Chandler>Like uh, all of the sudden you're jealous

184
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:03,370
<7-25,Chandler>我成为这里的猛男
<7-25,Chandler>because I've become the apartment stud.

185
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:06,770
<7-26,Joey>听起来比较像你的梦  老兄
<7-26,Joey>That kinda sounds like your dream dude.

186
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:12,260
<7-27,Monica>或许你看到我和钱德勒
<7-27,Monica>Or, it could mean that-that you saw Chandler and me together

187
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:13,870
<7-27,Monica>在一起很亲密
<7-27,Monica>and we y'know were being close and stuff

188
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,560
<7-27,Monica>你也想跟别人拥有这种关系
<7-27,Monica>and then you just want to have that with someone too.

189
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:19,030
<7-28,Joey>我在梦里的确很享受那种亲密
<7-28,Joey>In the dream I did enjoy the closeness.

190
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,900
<7-29,Monica>你对莫妮卡有兴趣吗
<7-29,Monica>are you attracted to Monica?

191
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,890
<7-30,Chandler>就说此时此刻吧  你对莫妮卡有兴趣吗
<7-30,Chandler>Right here, right now, are you attracted to her?

192
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:28,400
<7-31,Joey>没有
<7-31,Joey>Not really.

193
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:29,570
<7-32,Chandler>这就对了
<7-32,Chandler>Well there you have it!

194
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,500
<7-33,Monica>当然啦  我穿得这么休闲
<7-33,Monica>Well sure! I'm just wearing sweats!

195
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,310
<7-33,Monica>但这是好事  你不是爱我
<7-33,Monica>But that's good that you're not in love with me,

196
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,510
<7-33,Monica>你只是想交个女朋友
<7-33,Monica>because you just want a girlfriend!

197
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,390
<7-34,Joey>我觉得不是交女朋友的问题
<7-34,Joey>No, I don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend.

198
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,840
<7-34,Joey>我可以找个女朋友
<7-34,Joey>Y'know? I mean, yeah, I can get a girlfriend!

199
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:46,670
<7-34,Joey>我们可以坐在那里填字谜
<7-34,Joey>Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords,

200
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,100
<7-34,Joey>但我们会拥有
<7-34,Joey>but y'know are we ever going to have

201
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,640
<7-34,Joey>你们那种亲密吗
<7-34,Joey>y'know the closeness like-like you guys have?

202
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:53,310
<7-35,Chandler>莫妮卡和我在恋爱前就是朋友
<7-35,Chandler>Well y'know, Monica and I were friends before we started dating.

203
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,790
<7-35,Chandler>也许关键在这里
<7-35,Chandler>So maybe-maybe that's it?

204
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,960
<7-36,Joey>先做朋友  有意思
<7-36,Joey>Friends first? That's interesting.

205
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,200
<7-37,Monica>你们都事后当朋友吗
<7-37,Monica>You become friends after?

<9-6,Joey>那种关系实在很不错
<9-6,Joey>Yeah that's not such a bad situation they got going over there.

250
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,330
<9-6,Joey>我也想自己弄一段
<9-6,Joey>I'm thinking of getting me one of those.

251
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,060
<9-7,Rachel>乔伊  你想说什么
<9-7,Rachel>What's up Joe?

252
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:55,420
<9-8,Joey>我觉得他们感觉会那么好
<9-8,Joey>Well, the reason I think Monica and Chandler are so great...

253
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,690
<9-10,Joey>是因为他们是先做朋友
<9-10,Joey>...is because they were friends first.

254
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:00,570
<9-10,Joey>于是我问自己  谁是我朋友
<9-10,Joey>Y'know? So I asked myself, "Who are my friends?"

255
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:04,390
<9-10,Joey>你和菲比  而我先遇见你  所以...
<9-10,Joey>You and Phoebe, and I saw you first. So...

256
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,220
<9-11,Rachel>你在说什么
<9-11,Rachel>What are you saying?

257
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:12,130
<9-12,Joey>我是说也许你我可以更进一步
<9-12,Joey>I'm saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch.

258
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:21,100
<9-13,Rachel>亲爱的  我真是受宠若惊
<9-13,Rachel>Y'know honey, umm, as uh, as flattered as I am that uh,

259
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:22,800
<9-13,Rachel>你先遇见我
<9-13,Rachel>you saw me first,

260
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:28,390
<9-13,Rachel>但我不觉得我们应该更进一步
<9-13,Rachel>uhh, I just, I-I don't think we should be cranking anything up.

261
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,030
<9-14,Joey>我会对你很好的
<9-14,Joey>I'll treat you real nice.

262
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:41,030
<9-15,Rachel>你知道吗
<9-15,Rachel>Yeah, well, y'know umm...

263
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:45,770
<9-15,Rachel>我觉得先做朋友再交往
<9-15,Rachel>No honey, listen I think it's a great idea to become friends

264
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,410
<9-15,Rachel>是一个很好的想法
<9-15,Rachel>with someone before you date them,

265
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:50,010
<9-15,Rachel>但你应该先去认识一个人
<9-15,Rachel>but I think the way you do it is y'know you meet someone,

266
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:53,260
<9-15,Rachel>跟她做朋友  建立基础
<9-15,Rachel>become their friend, build a foundation,

267
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:55,060
<9-15,Rachel>再约她出去
<9-15,Rachel>then you ask them out on a date.

268
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,730
<9-15,Rachel>别对现有的朋友下手
<9-15,Rachel>Don't hit on your existing friends!

269
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,410
<9-16,Joey>那不是要很久吗
<9-16,Joey>Won't-won't that take longer?

270
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:06,490
<9-17,Rachel>没错  但是一旦找到
<9-17,Rachel>Yeah. Yeah. Oh, but once you find it,

271
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,300
<9-17,Rachel>等待就是值得的
<9-17,Rachel>ohh it's so worth the wait.

272
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:12,620
<9-18,Joey>我懂  我懂
<9-18,Joey>Yeah. I understand. I understand.

273
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,690
<9-18,Joey>真希望先遇见菲比
<9-18,Joey>Man, I wish I saw Phoebe first!

274
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:22,110
<10-1,Ross>来我身边吧
<10-1,Ross>Come here to me.

275
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:25,500

277
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:31,110
<10-2,Rachel>我带援军来了
<10-2,Rachel>I brought reinforcements.

278
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,010
<10-3,Ross>太好了  是乔伊吗
<10-3,Ross>Oh great! What, you brought Joey?

279
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,800

<10-4,Rachel>Well, I brought the next best thing.

<10-6,Ross>Chandler?! You brought Chandler?!

281
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:40,280
<10-6,Ross>只差一点的是莫妮卡
<10-6,Ross>The next best thing would be Monica!

282
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:45,180
<10-7,Chandler>我应该要不爽  但莫妮卡真的壮得可怕
<10-7,Chandler>Y'know, I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong, so...

283
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:49,310
<10-8,Ross>我画了一张搬运草图
<10-8,Ross>Look, I-I drew a sketch about how we're gonna do it. Okay

<10-12,Ross>不  那是我的手臂
<10-12,Ross>No! That's-that's my arm!

349
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,740

<12-15,Phoebe>我不在就太好了
<12-15,Phoebe>I would love it if I weren't here!
