<11-10,Ross>我今天跟珍妮斯在一起很开心
<11-10,Ross>but, I just had a great day with Janice!

<11-13,Ross>I mean I talked for hours.

265
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:58,060
<11-13,Ross>当有人专心听你倾诉时

<11-16,Phoebe>那才不是饼干  只是馊馄饨
<11-16,Phoebe>Hey-hey that's not a Nutter-Butter, that's just an old Wonton!

<11-18,Phoebe>-很难判定  -是啊
<11-18,Phoebe>- Ohh, tough call. - Yeah.

272
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,680
<12-1,Doug>说真的  我坚信
<12-1,Doug>But seriously, I strongly believe

00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,190
<12-4,Chandler>我要一点点糖
<12-4,Chandler>Just a little bit of sugar.

278
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,470
<12-5,Doug>那就让莫妮卡把手指伸进去
<12-5,Doug>Well, maybe I'll bring it out and have Monica stick her finger in it.

279
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,080
<12-5,Doug>应该就会甜了
<12-5,Doug>That oughta sweeten it up, huh?

280
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:43,490
<12-6,Monica>你那样笑怎么不会头痛
<12-6,Monica>How does that laugh not give you a headache?

281
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:44,610
<12-7,Chandler>久了就习惯了
<12-7,Chandler>Oh, you get used to it.

282
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,190
<12-8,Monica>我不觉得我会习惯
<12-8,Monica>Y'know, I-I-I don't think that I can.

283
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,980
<12-8,Monica>希望你别介意  我以后不会陪你应酬了
<12-8,Monica>So if you don't mind, maybe this will be it for me on the work things.

284
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:51,470
<12-9,Chandler>上司说笑话我就笑  这有什么啊
<12-9,Chandler>So I laugh at my boss's jokes, what's the big deal?

285
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,370
<12-10,Monica>如果能跟我尊敬的男友在一起
<12-10,Monica>I'd rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy

286
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:58,210
<12-10,Monica>我干嘛陪一个没尊严的马屁精
<12-10,Monica>when I can be hanging out with my boyfriend who I actually respect.

287
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,720
<12-12,Doug>我得为卡拉煮的咖啡道歉
<12-12,Doug>Uh, I gotta apologize for Kara's coffee.

288
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:06,640
<12-12,Doug>我真同情这咖啡  如果打架的话
<12-12,Doug>Y'know, I feel sorry for it if it ever got in a fight,

289
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:08,870
<12-12,Doug>完全没能力自卫(not strong指咖啡不够浓)
<12-12,Doug>it's not strong enough to defend itself.

290
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:14,820
<12-12,Doug>宾  你听到我的话了吗
<12-12,Doug>Did you hear what I said Bing?

291
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:16,610
<12-13,Chandler>什么

292
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:20,200
<12-14,Doug>那个笑话啊  你是怎么了
<12-14,Doug>The joke Bing. What's the matter with you?

293
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,990
<12-15,Chandler>我只是觉得不好笑
<12-15,Chandler>Well, I-I just didn't think it was funny sir.

294
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,870
<12-16,Doug>你说什么
<12-16,Doug>Excuse me?

295
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,280
<12-17,Chandler>我只是...
<12-17,Chandler>Well, I just...

296
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:31,270
<12-18,Monica>亲爱的  我觉得你没听懂
<12-18,Monica>Honey, I just don't think that you understood the joke.

297
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,150
<12-19,Chandler>是吗
<12-19,Chandler>Really?

298
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,710
<12-20,Monica>真的很有趣
<12-20,Monica>Yeah! I mean it was really funny,

299
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,370
<12-20,Monica>只是你没明白
<12-20,Monica>I-I just don't think you got it.

300
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:41,060
<12-20,Monica>卡拉煮的咖啡很淡
<12-20,Monica>You see Kara's coffee is-is-is weak tasting,

301
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:45,670
<12-20,Monica>但道格是用双关说它很虚弱
<12-20,Monica>okay? But-but what Doug did was-was imply that it was weak physically.

302
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,710
<12-20,Monica>现在你懂了吗
<12-20,Monica>You get it now honey?

303
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,700
<12-21,Chandler>我懂了
<12-21,Chandler>I think I do!

304
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,330
<12-21,Chandler>谢谢你  莫妮卡

00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,320
<12-23,Chandler>咖啡打架
<12-23,Chandler>Coffee in a fight!

<14-3,Chandler>但我们还没准备好告诉大家
<14-3,Chandler>But we're not ready to tell yet!

318

<14-4,Monica>我知道  只是从中学到现在
<14-4,Monica>I know! It's just that...ever since high school

319
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:57,340

348
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:00,760
<15-9,Janice>你的工作没了
<15-9,Janice>And then you lose your job!

349
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:02,870
<15-9,Janice>你的前妻很快就再婚
<15-9,Janice>And then your ex-wife gets married so fast!

<15-11,Janice>我们俩没戏唱了
<15-11,Janice>the sun has set on our day in the sun.

<15-14,Ross>我没听错吧
<15-14,Ross>Let-let me make sure I'm hearing this right,
