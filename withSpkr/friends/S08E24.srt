1
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:07,730
<1-1,Chandler>我们该告诉瑞秋
<1-1,Chandler>Should we tell Rachel

2
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:10,360
<1-1,Chandler>她隔壁就有一间单人待产室吗
<1-1,Chandler>there's an empty private room right next door to hers?

3
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:14,610
<1-2,Monica>可以啊  或者我们可以在这里做爱
<1-2,Monica>We could. Or we could have sex in it.

4
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:20,040
<1-3,Chandler>让我边脱裤子边想吧
<1-3,Chandler>Well, let me think about that while I remove my pants!

5
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:25,240
<1-4,Monica>好了  先生  为我播种吧
<1-4,Monica>Okay, mister! Fertilize me!

6
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,090
<1-5,Monica>那是珍妮丝的声音吗
<1-5,Monica>Does that sound like Janice?

7
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:41,770
<1-6,Chandler>如果不是她  那就是个很像她的人
<1-6,Chandler>If it's not, then there's two of them.

8
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:45,450
<1-6,Chandler>而那表示世界末日到了
<1-6,Chandler>And that would mean it's the end of the world!

20
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,220
<2-3,Chandler>我不敢相信要拖这么久 你还好吗
<2-3,Chandler>I can't believe this is taking so long. How you doing?

21
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,990
<2-4,Rachel>还不错  你知道想使劲把圣柏纳犬
<2-4,Rachel>Not bad. You know that feeling, when you trying to

22
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:37,790
<2-5,Monica>从屁股里拉出来的感觉吗
<2-5,Monica>blow a Saint Bernard out your ass?

23
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,790
<2-6,Rachel>真是太奇怪了  我好像听到...
<2-6,Rachel>Weirdest thing. Did I hear...?

24
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,360
<2-7,Chandler>天啊  是真的
<2-7,Chandler>Mother of God, it's true!

25
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:50,210
<2-8,Janice>钱德勒`宾
<2-8,Janice>Chandler Bing!

26
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,150
<2-9,Chandler>珍妮丝
<2-9,Chandler>Janice.

27
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:54,360
<2-10,Ross>不只是那样  珍妮丝要生了
<2-10,Ross>Not just Janice. Janice in labor.

28
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,790
<2-10,Ross>她在经历阵痛什么的
<2-10,Ross>Contracting and everything.

29
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:01,060
<2-11,Janice>生孩子对我来说很容易  我的骨盆很宽
<2-11,Janice>Oh, this should be easy. I have a very wide pelvis.

30
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:03,250
<2-11,Janice>你应该记得  钱德勒
<2-11,Janice>You remember, Chandler.

31
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:09,200
<2-12,Chandler>珍妮丝  我都不知道你怀孕了
<2-12,Chandler>Janice, I didn't even know you were pregnant.

32
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,940
<2-12,Chandler>你偷走了哪个笨蛋的"精"华
<2-12,Chandler>Who's the unwitting human whose essence you've stolen?

33
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,690
<2-12,Chandler>是你
<2-12,Chandler>It's you.

34
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:19,310
<2-13,Janice>这是你的孩子
<2-13,Janice>This is yours.

35
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,340
<2-14,Chandler>什么
<2-14,Chandler>What?

36
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,480
<2-15,Janice>看他有多紧张
<2-15,Janice>Look how nervous he gets!

37
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,990
<2-15,Janice>我们都好几年没上过床了
<2-15,Janice>We haven't slept together in years!

38
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,990
<2-16,Chandler>那可真搞笑  会痛吗  生孩子会痛吗
<2-16,Chandler>That's funny. Does it hurt ? Does the labor hurt?

39
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,190
<3-1,Phoebe>好吧  我想到一个
<3-1,Phoebe>Okay, I've got one for you.

40
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,740
<3-1,Phoebe>如果非吃不可  你要吃哪一个
<3-1,Phoebe>If you had to, which would you rather eat?

41
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,910
<3-1,Phoebe>千里眼的小狗还是会说话的猩猩
<3-1,Phoebe>A Seeing Eye dog or a talking gorilla?

42
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:49,050
<3-2,Cliff>我要选会说话的猩猩
<3-2,Cliff>I'd have to say the talking gorilla.

43
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:53,290
<3-2,Cliff>因为至少我可以跟它解释是你逼我吃掉它的
<3-2,Cliff>Because at least I could explain to him that you're making me eat him.

44
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,630
<3-3,Phoebe>-某人念过大学哦  -对
<3-3,Phoebe>- Oh. Somebody went to college. - Yeah.

45
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,960
<3-3,Phoebe>怎么了  对不起
<3-3,Phoebe>Wow. What is it? I'm sorry.

46
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:04,060
<3-4,Cliff>对不起  我的脚好痒
<3-4,Cliff>I'm sorry. My foot itches like crazy.

47
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,610
<3-5,Phoebe>让我来吧
<3-5,Phoebe>Oh. I'll get it.

48
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,140
<3-6,Cliff>通常我跟女人混熟之后
<3-6,Cliff>I usually get to know a girl better

49
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,990
<3-6,Cliff>才会让她用汤匙帮我搔痒
<3-6,Cliff>before I let her spoon me.

50
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:15,410
<3-7,Phoebe>别激动  我们又不是要用"插"子
<3-7,Phoebe>Relax. It's not like we're forking.

51
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,330
<4-1,Rachel>这都第五个了  罗期
<4-1,Rachel>Oh, that's five, Ross.

52
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:28,160
<4-1,Rachel>五个女人生了五个孩子
<4-1,Rachel>Five women have had five babies...

53
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:30,550
<4-1,Rachel>我还是没生
<4-1,Rachel>...and I have had no babies.

54
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:33,260
<4-1,Rachel>她为什么不肯出来
<4-1,Rachel>Why doesn't she want to come out?

55
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,750
<4-2,Ross>你知道我在想什么吗
<4-2,Ross>You know what I think it is?

56
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:38,460
<4-2,Ross>我想九个月来
<4-2,Ross>I think you made such a nice home for her

57
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:41,850
<4-2,Ross>她在你的身体里住得很舒服  所以不想离开
<4-2,Ross>over the last nine months that she just doesn't want to leave.

58
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:46,380
<4-3,Rachel>你甚至在瞎掰哄我
<4-3,Rachel>Look at you making up crap for me.

59
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,930
<4-3,Rachel>-天啊  -好吧
<4-3,Rachel>- Oh, God. - Okay. Okay.

60
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:54,840
<4-4,Dr. Long>21个小时了  你简直是英雄
<4-4,Dr. Long>Twenty-one hours. You're a hero.

61
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,540
<4-5,Rachel>医生  你得想想办法  给我用药吧
<4-5,Rachel>Doctor, you gotta do something! Get me drugs...

62
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,410
<4-5,Rachel>或是放火把她熏出来
<4-5,Rachel>...or light a fire up in there and just smoke it out!

63
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:06,360
<4-6,Dr. Long>事实上  我想你可以进产房了
<4-6,Dr. Long>Actually, I think you're ready to go to the delivery room.

64
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:07,970
<4-7,Rachel>什么
<4-7,Rachel>What?

65
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:11,070
<4-8,Dr. Long>开了10公分了  你快当妈妈了
<4-8,Dr. Long>Ten centimeters. You're about to become a mom.

66
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:15,070
<4-8,Dr. Long>天啊  好吧
<4-8,Dr. Long>Oh, my God. Okay.

67
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:18,100
<4-9,Rachel>打败你了  逊鬼
<4-9,Rachel>Beat you, sucker!

68
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:31,240
<5-3,Cliff>天啊  他就是刚刚来看过我的医生
<5-3,Cliff>Oh, my God! That's the doctor who was in my room before.

69
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,320
<5-4,Phoebe>好吧  幻想先生
<5-4,Phoebe>Okay, Mr. Percocet.

70
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:41,160
<5-5,Cliff>我跟你说  电视里的那个人刚刚来过
<5-5,Cliff>I'm telling you, the guy from that show was here..

71
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,610
<5-5,Cliff>还问了我一堆怪问题
<5-5,Cliff>in my room asking me all these weird questions.

72
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:47,720
<5-6,Phoebe>克利夫  你真的相信电视明星
<5-6,Phoebe>Cliff, do you really believe that a character from a TV show

73
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,390
<5-6,Phoebe>来过你的房间
<5-6,Phoebe>was here in your room?

74
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,330
<5-7,Joey>瑞秋要生了
<5-7,Joey>Rachel's having her baby!

75
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:56,730
<5-8,Cliff>就是他  你认识他吗
<5-8,Cliff>That's him! You know him?

76
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,030
<5-9,Phoebe>好吧  我...好吧
<5-9,Phoebe>Okay. Okay. I... Okay.

77
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,240
<5-9,Phoebe>我派我朋友乔伊来调查你
<5-9,Phoebe>I sent my friend, Joey, in here to find out stuff about you.

78
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,830
<5-9,Phoebe>如果有帮助的话
<5-9,Phoebe>If it... You know, if it helps,

79
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:09,140
<5-9,Phoebe>我们觉得你是个好人
<5-9,Phoebe>you came off great.

80
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:11,820
<5-9,Phoebe>比现在的我好多了
<5-9,Phoebe>A lot better than I'm coming off right now.

81
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:17,200
<5-10,Cliff>我不敢相信你要他假扮医生
<5-10,Cliff>I don't believe this. You got him to pretend he was some fake doctor?

82
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,120
<5-11,Joey>假扮  对不起  看这里
<5-11,Joey>Fake? Excuse me? Hello?

83
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:24,630
<5-12,Cliff>你还要我以为自己疯了
<5-12,Cliff>And then you tried making me think I was crazy?

84
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:28,170
<5-13,Phoebe>那样是不对的  我非常抱歉
<5-13,Phoebe>Right. That was wrong. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

85
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,950
<5-13,Phoebe>那只是因为我非常喜欢你
<5-13,Phoebe>It's just that I liked you so much.

86
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:32,720
<5-13,Phoebe>我们能重新开始吗
<5-13,Phoebe>Can we just start over?

87
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,300
<5-14,Cliff>我觉得不行
<5-14,Cliff>I don't think so.

88
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:39,240
<5-15,Joey>我可以说话吗  你跟我透露了很多你的私事
<5-15,Joey>If I may? You told me a lot of personal stuff about you, right?

89
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,940
<5-15,Joey>或许你应该知道一些关于她的私事
<5-15,Joey>Now, maybe it would help if you knew some personal stuff about her.

90
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:47,820
<5-15,Joey>她曾跟男同志冰舞选手结婚
<5-15,Joey>She was married to a gay ice dancer.

91
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:53,430
<5-15,Joey>她帮她弟弟生下三胞胎
<5-15,Joey>She gave birth to her brother's triplets.

92
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:58,840
<5-15,Joey>她的双胞胎姐姐曾是A片女优
<5-15,Joey>Her twin sister used to do porn.

93
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,860
<5-16,Phoebe>-乔伊  你简直是越抹越黑  -对
<5-16,Phoebe>- Joey, we're trying to dial down the crazy. - Right.

94
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,930
<5-17,Joey>我们对彼此并不太了解
<5-17,Joey>We don't really know each other,

95
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:10,270
<5-18,Phoebe>要忘记这次相遇很容易
<5-18,Phoebe>so it'd be easy to forget about this...

96
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:12,980
<5-18,Phoebe>但我们对彼此都有感觉
<5-18,Phoebe>...but there's something between us.

97
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,290
<5-18,Phoebe>我不知道你是怎么样...
<5-18,Phoebe>I don't know about you...

98
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:16,500
<5-18,Phoebe>但我不常有这种奇妙邂逅
<5-18,Phoebe>...but that doesn't happen to me a lot.

99
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,190
<5-19,Cliff>-我也是  -我也是
<5-19,Cliff>- It doesn't happen to me either. - Me neither!

100
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:30,420
<6-1,Dr. Long>用力  你得再用力五秒
<6-1,Dr. Long>Push. Push. We're gonna push for five more seconds.

<6-3,Dr. Long>下一次阵痛是20秒后
<6-3,Dr. Long>The next contraction should be in about 20 seconds.

104
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:42,330
<6-5,Ross>-我没办法再用力了  -你表现得很好
<6-5,Ross>- I can't push any more! - You're doing great.

105
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:45,210
<6-6,Rachel>天啊  这根本就不到20秒嘛
<6-6,Rachel>Oh, God! Twenty seconds, my ass!

106
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:47,890
<6-7,Dr. Long>来吧  继续用力
<6-7,Dr. Long>Here we go. Okay, keep pushing.

<6-1,Dr. Long>-来吧  -用力  等一下
<6-1,Dr. Long>- Come on. - Push. Wait.

108
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:50,880
<6-7,Dr. Long>我看到了什么
<6-7,Dr. Long>I see something.

109
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,670
<6-8,Ross>什么  真的吗  我的天啊
<6-8,Ross>What, you do? You do? Oh, my God!

110
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:56,920
<6-9,Rachel>-别说"我的天啊"  什么  -那是什么
<6-9,Rachel>- Don't say "Oh, my God!" What?! - What is that?

<6-11,Dr. Long>宝宝的屁股  她倒位了
<6-11,Dr. Long>The baby's buttocks. She's breech.

00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:02,930
<6-12,Ross>-我还以为她有两个头  -天啊
<6-12,Ross>- I thought she had two heads. - Oh, God!

113
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:05,700
<6-13,Rachel>她没事吧
<6-13,Rachel>Is she gonna be okay?

<6-14,Dr. Long>-她没事的  -好吧
<6-14,Dr. Long>- She's gonna be fine. - Okay.

115
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,190
<6-14,Dr. Long>她的胎位不正
<6-14,Dr. Long>She's in a more difficult position,

116
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:10,680
<6-14,Dr. Long>你得更加用力才行
<6-14,Dr. Long>so you have to push harder now, go, push.

117
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,880
<6-15,Ross>-好吧  -就是那样  用力
<6-15,Ross>- Okay. - That's it. Push. Push.

<6-17,Rachel>抱歉  我办不到
<6-17,Rachel>I'm sorry, I can't! I can't!

<6-21,Rachel>我不知道咋办  拜托  帮我用力吧
<6-21,Rachel>I had no idea. Please, you do it for me!

122
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:25,850
<6-22,Ross>来吧  再来一次
<6-22,Ross>Let's go. One more time.

<6-22,Ross>最后一次  准备好了吗
<6-22,Ross>One final push, ready?

<7-8,Chandler>It's incredible. I mean, one minute she's inside you...

155
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:59,260
<7-8,Chandler>而47小时后  她就出生了

00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:23,220
<7-12,Phoebe>我可以捏碎你的小脑袋
<7-12,Phoebe>Oh, I could squeeze your little head.

161
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,100

163
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,110
<7-14,Rachel>没事  我只是禁不住要哭
<7-14,Rachel>Nothing. I just can't stop crying.

164
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:34,930
<7-15,Ross>医生说这很正常  都是荷尔蒙害的
<7-15,Ross>The doctor said it's completely normal, with all the hormones,

165
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:36,440
<7-15,Ross>而且你一直都没睡觉
<7-15,Ross>plus you're sleep-deprived.

166
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,790
<7-16,Rachel>你们也都没睡
<7-16,Rachel>So. You guys are all sleep-deprived.

167
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:43,250
<7-16,Rachel>我怎么没见你们因为拖鞋穿错脚就哭哭啼啼
<7-16,Rachel>I don't see you weeping because you put your slippers on the wrong feet.

168
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:46,150
<7-17,Joey>天啊
<7-17,Joey>Oh, God.

169
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:50,040
<7-18,Rachel>-现在怎么了  -我又想起那事了
<7-18,Rachel>- What's the matter now? - I was reliving it.

170
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:54,170
<7-20,Chandler>你们帮她取好名字了吗
<7-20,Chandler>Do you know what you're gonna call her yet?

171
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:57,350
<7-21,Phoebe>等一下  她不是叫小姑娘吗
<7-21,Phoebe>Wait, it's not gonna be Baby Girl?

172
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,620
<7-21,Phoebe>我觉得那个名字很有创意
<7-21,Phoebe>I thought that was so original.

173
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,060
<7-22,Ross>事实上我们正在考虑两个名字
<7-22,Ross>Actually, we've narrowed it down to two names.

174
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:06,190
<7-23,Rachel>你知道吗  两个名字我都很喜欢
<7-23,Rachel>And you know what? I love them both.

175
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:09,430
<7-23,Rachel>你选哪个  我们就用哪个
<7-23,Rachel>So why don't you just pick one, and that'll be it.

176
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,850
<7-24,Ross>好吧  大伙们...
<7-24,Ross>Okay. Everyone...

177
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:19,860
<7-24,Ross>她是伊莎贝拉
<7-24,Ross>...this is Isabella.

178
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:22,910
<7-24,Ross>-嗨  伊莎贝拉  -嗨
<7-24,Ross>- Hi, Isabella! - Hi.

179
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,510
<7-25,Rachel>怎么了
<7-25,Rachel>What?

180
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:31,210
<7-25,Rachel>听着不像她的名字
<7-25,Rachel>That's not her name.

181
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:35,180
<7-25,Rachel>抱歉  她感觉上不像伊莎贝拉
<7-25,Rachel>I'm sorry, she just doesn't feel like an Isabella.

182
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:37,570
<7-27,Joey>-另一个名字是什么  -迪莉拉
<7-27,Joey>- What was the other one? - Delilah.

183
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:41,730
<7-29,Rachel>太棒了  突然间她就成了圣经时代的妓女
<7-29,Rachel>Oh, great! Suddenly she sounds like a biblical whore.

184
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,640
<7-30,Ross>那我们还是叫她小姑娘吧
<7-30,Ross>So I guess we're back to Baby Girl.

185
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,170
<7-32,Rachel>我们该怎么办
<7-32,Rachel>What are we gonna do?

186
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:54,330
<7-33,Monica>没关系  你们会想到好名字的
<7-33,Monica>It's okay. You'll find a name.

187
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:55,460
<7-34,Ross>你说得倒容易
<7-34,Ross>Easy for you to say.

188
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:58,080
<7-34,Ross>你已经知道你的孩子要叫什么名字了
<7-34,Ross>You already know what your kids' names will be.

189
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:02,700
<7-36,Monica>-是吗  -我14岁时就帮他们取好了名字
<7-36,Monica>- You do? - Yeah, I had them picked out since I was 14.

190
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,830
<7-37,Chandler>不  你的宝宝会以点心
<7-37,Chandler>Oh, no, it's gonna be named after some snack

191
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:07,030
<7-37,Chandler>或烘烤食物的名字来命名吧
<7-37,Chandler>or baked good, isn't it?

192
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,030
<7-38,Rachel>告诉我们你想了什么名字
<7-38,Rachel>Well, tell us, what are they?

<7-39,Monica>Okay. If it's a boy, it's Daniel.

194
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,460
<7-40,Rachel>-如果是女孩呢  -我不想说
<7-40,Rachel>- And if it's a girl? - I don't wanna say.

195
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:23,400
<7-42,Rachel>少来了  告诉我们  我们不会抢走的
<7-42,Rachel>Oh, stop. Tell us. We're not gonna want it.

00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:44,250
<7-45,Monica>-拿去吧  -什么
<7-45,Monica>- Take it. - What?

200
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,480
<7-47,Monica>她很适合叫艾玛
<7-47,Monica>She's clearly an Emma.

201
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,440
<7-48,Rachel>亲爱的  但你很喜欢那个名字
<7-48,Rachel>Oh, honey, but you love that name.

00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:52,730
<7-49,Monica>对  但我更爱你
<7-49,Monica>Yeah, but I love you more.

203
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:59,560
<7-49,Monica>而且什么名字都跟宾不配  所以我是死定了
<7-49,Monica>Besides, nothing goes with Bing. So I'm screwed.

204
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:08,210
<7-49,Monica>艾伦·利普曼·古拉尼克
<7-49,Monica>Aaron Lipman-Guralnick

206
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:23,200
<9-1,Janice>看到他会说不出话来  对吧
<9-1,Janice>Wow, he kind of takes your breath away, doesn't he?

207
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,360
<9-2,Rachel>他是个好男人
<9-2,Rachel>He's a keeper.

00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:30,000
<9-3,Janice>-你觉得如何  -我很好

<9-5,Janice>我真的很佩服你所做的一切
<9-5,Janice>Can I just say I really admire what you're doing.

210
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,410
<9-5,Janice>你要自己抚养她
<9-5,Janice>Just raising her all alone.

211
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:41,710
<9-6,Rachel>我不是一个人  我有罗斯
<9-6,Rachel>I'm not doing it alone. I have Ross.

212
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:44,100
<9-7,Janice>现在是的
<9-7,Janice>Sure. Now.

213
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:47,450
<9-7,Janice>如果他结识别人结了婚  到时你该怎么办
<9-7,Janice>But what happens when he meets somebody else and gets married?

214
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:50,440
<9-8,Rachel>他会离婚的  他可是罗斯
<9-8,Rachel>Well, then he gets a divorce. It's Ross.

215
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,550
<9-9,Janice>我得告诉你  瑞秋  听珍妮丝的话
<9-9,Janice>I'm telling you, Rachel, listen to Janice.

216
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:58,960
<9-9,Janice>男人都说他们会陪你
<9-9,Janice>They all say they're gonna be there,

217
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,610
<9-9,Janice>但他们会成立自己的家庭
<9-9,Janice>until they start their real family.

218
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:06,720
<9-10,Rachel>罗斯不会那么做的
<9-10,Rachel>That's never gonna happen with Ross.

219
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,450
<9-11,Janice>以前我也相信我前夫不会那样
<9-11,Janice>That's what I thought about my first husband.

220
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:10,900
<9-11,Janice>现在如果孩子能跟她爸  双胞胎和隆胸小姐
<9-11,Janice>Now, I'm lucky if my kid gets to spend a weekend with her father...

221
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,550
<9-11,Janice>共度周末  我就谢天谢地了
<9-11,Janice>and the twins and little Miss New Boobs.

222
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:16,710
<9-12,Rachel>真的吗
<9-12,Rachel>Really?

223
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,700
<9-13,Janice>我也不想跟你说这种话
<9-13,Janice>I hate to be the one to say it...

224
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:24,200
<9-13,Janice>但你们两个人得靠自己
<9-13,Janice>...but, honey, you two are on your own.

225
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:29,600
<9-13,Janice>这个...  你知道的  这...
<9-13,Janice>Well, that's... You know, that's...

226
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,220
<9-14,Rachel>我们已经单独相处了20分钟
<9-14,Rachel>We've been alone for the last 20 minutes

227
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,080
<9-14,Rachel>没出什么问题
<9-14,Rachel>and we're doing okay.

228
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:37,010
<9-14,Rachel>也许我们不必靠自己
<9-14,Rachel>Besides, you know what? Maybe we won't be alone.

229
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:41,960
<9-14,Rachel>因为最近我跟罗斯之间擦出了火花
<9-14,Rachel>Because lately things have been happening between me and Ross.

230
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:47,110
<9-14,Rachel>我来医院前  我们还接了吻
<9-14,Rachel>And right before I went into labor, we had this kiss. You know?

231
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,850
<9-14,Rachel>或许我们会再续前缘
<9-14,Rachel>So it might be the beginning of something.

232
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:56,260
<9-15,Ross>-嗨  珍妮丝  -嗨
<9-15,Ross>- Hey, Janice. - Oh, hi.

<9-18,Janice>-艾伦  那是你未来的岳父  -不
<9-18,Janice>- Say hello to Aaron, your future son-in-law. - Oh, no.

235
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:08,970
<9-20,Janice>-我让你们一家人好好独处  -好吧
<9-20,Janice>- I'm gonna leave you three alone. - Okay.

236
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:13,190
<9-22,Janice>天啊  你看到那孩子的鼻子了吗
<9-22,Janice>Man, you see the kid on that nose?

237
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,290
<9-24,Rachel>你知道我刚刚在想什么吗
<9-24,Rachel>You know what I was thinking about?

238
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:26,000
<9-26,Rachel>我们出门前的那个吻
<9-26,Rachel>That kiss before we left the apartment.

239
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:28,690
<9-26,Rachel>那不只是普通的一吻  对吧
<9-26,Rachel>That was something, huh?

240
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,720
<9-27,Ross>对  没错
<9-27,Ross>Yeah. Yeah, it really was.

241
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,220
<9-27,Ross>但我们得小心点
<9-27,Ross>But we... We gotta be careful.

242
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,320
<9-27,Ross>我们...你知道的  我们不能让历史重演
<9-27,Ross>We... You know, we can't let that happen again, you know?

243
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,300
<9-28,Rachel>对
<9-28,Rachel>Right.

244
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:45,690
<9-29,Ross>我们不希望重蹈覆辙  对吧
<9-29,Ross>We don't want to go down that road, do we?

245
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:49,630
<9-30,Rachel>对  所以我才会跟你提这件事
<9-30,Rachel>No, of course not. That's why I brought it up.

246
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:55,690
<9-30,Rachel>医院没有汽水吗
<9-30,Rachel>They didn't have any sodas?

247
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:57,840
<9-30,Rachel>天啊  对不起
<9-30,Rachel>Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

248
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:01,270
<9-31,Ross>我忙着跟护士说话  完全忘了这事
<9-31,Ross>I was talking to this nurse. Completely forgot.

249
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:05,790
<9-32,Rachel>现在就已经开始了
<9-32,Rachel>And so it begins.

250
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:14,590
<10-1,Phoebe>她在里面吗
<10-1,Phoebe>She in there?

251
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:17,850
<10-2,Ross>对  护士正把她放在床上  那就是她
<10-2,Ross>Yeah. She's putting her down now. That's her.

252
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,700
<10-4,Ross>快看艾玛
<10-4,Ross>Look. Look at Emma.

253
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,030
<10-5,Phoebe>我不知道她长得更像你还是瑞秋
<10-5,Phoebe>I can't decide who she looks more like, you or Rachel.

254
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,090
<10-6,Ross>什么  开什么玩笑
<10-6,Ross>Oh, what, are you kidding?

255
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:26,690
<10-6,Ross>她美极了  完全遗传瑞秋
<10-6,Ross>She's gorgeous! It's all Rachel.

256
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:33,680
<10-7,Phoebe>对不起  这是我最后一次问你
<10-7,Phoebe>I'm sorry. For the last time,

257
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,950
<10-7,Phoebe>你们两个为什么不结婚
<10-7,Phoebe>why aren't you two together again?

258
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,920
<10-7,Phoebe>我知道因为你们没有到那个程度
<10-7,Phoebe>No, I know. Because you're not in that place.

259
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,070
<10-7,Phoebe>其实也没什么  但事实上你们绝对到了
<10-7,Phoebe>Which would be fine, except you totally are.

260
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,330
<10-8,Ross>情况很复杂  好吗
<10-8,Ross>It's complicated, okay?

261
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,410
<10-9,Phoebe>对  这话没错
<10-9,Phoebe>Yeah, that's true.

262
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:53,350
<10-9,Phoebe>你一直都爱着她  你们生了一个孩子
<10-9,Phoebe>You love her, you always have, you have a child together.

263
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:55,310
<10-9,Phoebe>谁知道你们该不该结婚
<10-9,Phoebe>There's no right answer.

264
00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:00,180
<10-10,Ross>我们曾经交往过  后来分手
<10-10,Ross>Look, we've been together. And then apart.

265
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:02,470
<10-10,Ross>复合后又分手
<10-10,Ross>And then together, and then apart.

266
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,730
<10-10,Ross>现在我们生了一个孩子
<10-10,Ross>And now we have a baby.

267
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:11,890
<10-10,Ross>如果我们又复合  结果还是分手
<10-10,Ross>It's just, if we got together again and it didn't work out...

268
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:15,550
<10-10,Ross>我不能对艾玛做那种事
<10-10,Ross>I could never do that to Emma.

269
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:21,280
<10-10,Ross>她来到这个世界上  觉得每件事都...
<10-10,Ross>I mean, she came into this world thinking everything...

270
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,530
<10-10,Ross>我怎么也这样了
<10-10,Ross>Now me.

271
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:27,110
<10-10,Ross>难道他们在水里放了催泪剂吗
<10-10,Ross>What, do they put something in the water in this place?

272
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:32,090
<10-10,Ross>瑞秋跟我现在过得很好
<10-10,Ross>It's just, Rachel and I, we're doing really well right now.

273
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,960
<10-11,Phoebe>我知道
<10-11,Phoebe>I know. I know. I know.

274
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,110
<10-11,Phoebe>如果你想更进一步  可能会毁掉现在的美好
<10-11,Phoebe>I know. If you try to make it more, you might wreck it.

275
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:38,310
<10-12,Ross>-没错  -对
<10-12,Ross>- Yeah, exactly. - Right.

276
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:44,540
<10-13,Phoebe>或者你可以得到你从15岁开始就梦想的生活
<10-13,Phoebe>Or you might get everything you've wanted since you were 15.

277
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:59,000
<11-1,Joey>我看到一个女人同时在喂双胞胎母乳
<11-1,Joey>I saw a woman breast-feeding twins at the same time.

278
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:01,460
<11-1,Joey>真的很像怪胎秀
<11-1,Joey>It is like a freak show up here.

279
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:04,950
<11-2,Rachel>-怎么了  -没事
<11-2,Rachel>- What's the matter? - Nothing.

280
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:06,820
<11-3,Joey>怎么了
<11-3,Joey>What is it? Hey.

281
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:08,190
<11-4,Rachel>真的没事  我...
<11-4,Rachel>Really, it's nothing. I'm...

282
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,220
<11-5,Joey>瑞秋  别这样  怎么了
<11-5,Joey>Rach, come on. What?

283
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:17,340
<11-6,Rachel>我一直在想我跟宝宝要怎么独自生活下去
<11-6,Rachel>I've just been thinking about how my baby and I are gonna be all alone.

284
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:20,300
<11-7,Joey>你在说什么  罗斯呢
<11-7,Joey>What are you talking about alone? What about Ross?

285
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:23,290
<11-8,Rachel>拜托  他会成立自己的家庭
<11-8,Rachel>Please. He'll be with his real family.

286
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:26,120
<11-8,Rachel>双胞胎跟隆胸小姐
<11-8,Rachel>The twins and little Miss New Boobs.

287
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:29,310
<11-9,Joey>难道我瞅了那女人这么久  这都啥时候的事
<11-9,Joey>Okay, how long was I watching that woman?

288
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,840
<11-10,Rachel>我只是说...
<11-10,Rachel>I'm just saying that, you know...

289
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:36,310
<11-10,Rachel>有一天罗斯会认识别的女人
<11-10,Rachel>...someday Ross is gonna meet somebody...

290
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,080
<11-10,Rachel>他会拥有自己的生活
<11-10,Rachel>...and he's gonna have his own life.

291
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,260
<11-10,Rachel>对吧
<11-10,Rachel>Right?

292
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,850
<11-11,Joey>你说得对
<11-11,Joey>Yeah, I guess so.

293
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:50,480
<11-12,Rachel>我没想到我要独自抚养这个宝宝
<11-12,Rachel>I just never thought I'd be raising this baby all by myself.

294
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,350
<11-12,Rachel>真的很傻吧
<11-12,Rachel>That's pretty dumb, huh?

295
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:56,130
<11-13,Joey>你得听我说  听着
<11-13,Joey>Hey, you listen to me. Listen to me.

296
00:19:57,050 --> 00:20:01,100
<11-13,Joey>你永远都不会孤立无援
<11-13,Joey>You are never, ever gonna be alone.

297
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:05,270
<11-13,Joey>我发誓我不会让那种事发生
<11-13,Joey>Okay? I promise I won't let that happen.

298
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:09,260
<11-13,Joey>乔伊
<11-13,Joey>Joey.

299
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:12,110
<11-14,Rachel>亲爱的  没有你我该怎么办
<11-14,Rachel>Oh, sweetie, what would I do without you?

300
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,950
<11-15,Joey>你不必担心  好吗
<11-15,Joey>You don't have to worry about that, okay?

301
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:23,710
<11-16,Rachel>你能再帮我拿盒面纸来吗
<11-16,Rachel>Could you grab me my other box of tissues?

302
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:26,750
<11-16,Rachel>-就在罗斯的外套下面  -没问题
<11-16,Rachel>- They're right on the chair under Ross' coat. - Sure.

303
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:37,750
<11-19,Joey>我的天啊
<11-19,Joey>Oh, my God!

304
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:40,910
<11-20,Rachel>乔伊
<11-20,Rachel>Joey?

305
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:45,020
<11-20,Rachel>我的天啊
<11-20,Rachel>Oh, my God.

306
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,620
<11-20,Rachel>好吧
<11-20,Rachel>Okay.

307
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:30,760
<11-20,Rachel>-刚刚简直太销魂了  -我知道
<11-20,Rachel>- That was amazing.  - I know.

308
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:35,640
<11-20,Rachel>你知不知道我们很可能
<11-20,Rachel>Hey, do you realize that

309
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:38,400
<11-20,Rachel>已经永远地改写了我们的生活
<11-20,Rachel>we may have just changed our lives forever?

310
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:40,550
<11-20,Rachel>我们可能已经开始组建了自己的家庭
<11-20,Rachel>We may have started our family.

311
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:42,790
<11-20,Rachel>九个月后我们可能会来这里...
<11-20,Rachel>In nine months we could be here...

312
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:44,780
<11-20,Rachel>生下我们的孩子
<11-20,Rachel>...having our own baby.

313
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,510
<11-20,Rachel>如果不行  我们就得在桶上做了
<11-20,Rachel>And if not, we got to do it on a bucket.
