<5-5,Rachel>Better not be about the apartment pants.

211
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,610
<5-5,Rachel>我刚刚向老板汇报了这个创意

00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:58,060
<5-8,Phoebe>-什么  -应该是没什么吧
<5-8,Phoebe>- What? - l mean, it's probably nothing.

<5-8,Phoebe>我只是想提醒你  他们或许会有什么
<5-8,Phoebe>But l wanted to warn you that there might be something there.

00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:03,630
<5-9,Rachel>-罗斯跟吉尔吗  -对
<5-9,Rachel>- With Ross and Jill? - Yeah.

231
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:41,090
<5-17,Rachel>而且吉尔有她的行动自由
