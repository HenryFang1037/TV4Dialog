<5-11,Chandler>电影公司招待的饭店大套房吗
<5-11,Chandler>Is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite?

212
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:32,190
<5-12,Joey>不是  这是独立制片的电影
<5-12,Joey>Uh no, not really. It's an independent film y'know?

213
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,420
<5-12,Joey>没有大预算
<5-12,Joey>So we don't have a real big budget.

214
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:34,960
<5-12,Joey>我想我就住你房间好了
<5-12,Joey>I figured I'd just stay in your room.

215
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,690
<5-13,Chandler>了解  但等你拿到片酬之后
<5-13,Chandler>I see, but once you get your first paycheck

216
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,410
<5-13,Chandler>你就有饭店大套房住了  对吗
<5-13,Chandler>you'll be springing a big hotel suite, right?

217
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,540
<5-13,Chandler>主演电影的片酬一定不少吧
<5-13,Chandler>I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?

218
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:43,570
<5-14,Joey>是啊  我算给你听
<5-14,Joey>Oh yeah! Check this out.

219
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,800
<5-14,Joey>《快门速度》每赚一块钱
<5-14,Joey>For every dollar Shutter Speed makes,

220
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:48,380
<5-14,Joey>就有一分落入乔伊的腰包
<5-14,Joey>one penny of it goes right in Joey's pocket.

221
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:52,520
<5-15,Chandler>所以电影赚钱你才有钱拿
<5-15,Chandler>So you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?

222
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,240
<5-16,Joey>你不知道这电影的情节吗
<5-16,Joey>Did you not hear the plot of the movie?

<5-16,Joey>"She's been dead for ten years."

224
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:01,650
<5-16,Joey>我就快变成百万富翁了

<6-36,Chandler>在桥上不能随便停车
<6-36,Chandler>You're not actually supposed to stop on the bridge.

00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:46,540
<6-37,Joey>-滚啦  -好啦

<7-2,Phoebe>No.

321
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:07,170
<7-3,Ross>你生我的气是因为我说你写字像小孩
<7-3,Ross>Are you angry at me because I said your handwriting is childlike?

322
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,940
<7-4,Phoebe>不是  这样才特别啊

00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:13,360
<7-5,Monica>因为他老爱纠正别人的语法
<7-5,Monica>Umm, is it because he's always correcting people's grammar?

325
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:16,770
<7-5,Monica>什么要用"谁"的宾格啦  有时候就是"谁"啦
<7-5,Monica>Whom! Whom! Sometimes it's who!

<7-6,Ross>是吗  有时候是
<7-6,Ross>Yeah? Sometimes it's...

327
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:24,770
<7-7,Rachel>是不是你玩棋盘游戏赢了他
<7-7,Rachel>Oh, did you beat him at a board game?

328
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,440
<7-7,Rachel>他开始居于劣势就会变得孩子气
<7-7,Rachel>He turns into such a baby when he starts to lose.

329
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:28,670
<7-8,Ross>好  我孩子气

<7-11,Monica>Chandler! What are you doing here?

332
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,310
<7-12,Ross>乔伊在华盛顿大桥上把我赶下车
<7-12,Ross>Joey kicked me out of the car on the George Washington bridge!

<7-15,Chandler>不知道  他突然发飙
<7-15,Chandler>I don't know! He went crazy!

335
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:41,780
<7-15,Chandler>我们在玩那个快问
<7-15,Chandler>Y'know, we were playing that game where you-you ask a question

336
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:43,180
<7-15,Chandler>快答的游戏
<7-15,Chandler>and you answer it really fast.

337
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:46,100
<7-16,Phoebe>没有我在场监督绝对不能玩那个游戏
<7-16,Phoebe>That game should not be played without my supervision.

338
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:49,760
<7-16,Phoebe>我不知道他干嘛气成那样
<7-16,Phoebe>Well, I don't know what mad him so mad,

339
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:51,180
<7-17,Chandler>我只是说
<7-17,Chandler>y'know? All I said was that uh,

340
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:53,030
<7-17,Chandler>我不觉得这次是他翻身的机会
<7-17,Chandler>I didn't think this wasn't gonna be his big break,

341
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,990
<7-17,Chandler>这部电影帮不了他
<7-17,Chandler>that this movie wasn't going to do anything for him,

342
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,260
<7-17,Chandler>是不是真有电影觉得都很悬
<7-17,Chandler>and that uh, y'know it didn't sound like a real movie--

343
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:59,440
<7-17,Chandler>好吧  他该把我推下桥才对
<7-17,Chandler>Okay, he should've pushed me off of the bridge.

344
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:01,490
<7-18,Phoebe>你袋子里是什么
<7-18,Phoebe>What's in the bag?

345
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,420
<7-19,Chandler>我猜想你们大家也会对我不爽
<7-19,Chandler>Oh, I figured you guys would all be mad at me.

346
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,910
<7-19,Chandler>所以我在路边捡了些礼物
<7-19,Chandler>So I got you some gifts that I found on the side of the road.

<8-33,Monica>Damn! It's empty!

379
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,330

386
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:52,230
<9-2,Monica>他很难过
<9-2,Monica>Y'know he's really upset about it.

387
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,530
<9-3,Joey>等他知道他毛衣背心的下场
<9-3,Joey>Not as upset as he's gonna be

388
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,650
<9-3,Joey>他一定会更难过
<9-3,Joey>when he finds out what I did with his sweater vests!

389
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:00,610
<9-4,Monica>你把他的毛衣背心怎么了
<9-4,Monica>What did you do to his sweater vests?

390
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:03,390
<9-5,Joey>这么说吧  在俄亥俄州有一伙打扮亮丽的狗
<9-5,Joey>Let's just say there's a well-dressed pack of dogs in Ohio.

391
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,880
<9-5,Joey>莫妮卡  菲比在吗
<9-5,Joey>Hey Monica listen is-is Phoebe there?

392
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:09,690
<9-5,Joey>我有车子的事要问她
<9-5,Joey>I gotta ask her something about the car.

393
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:10,980
<9-6,Monica>她在  你等等
<9-6,Monica>Yeah, she's here. Hold on a second.

394
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:12,690
<9-7,Phoebe>好啊  哥们
<9-7,Phoebe>Hey, dude!

395
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:15,090
<9-8,Joey>菲比  有个木盒
<9-8,Joey>Hey Pheebs! Listen, this wooden box

396
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:17,290
<9-8,Joey>不停地从座位底下滑出来  装的什么
<9-8,Joey>keeps sliding out from under the seat. What-what is it?

397
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:18,460
<9-9,Phoebe>那是我外婆
<9-9,Phoebe>Oh that's my grandma.

398
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:24,830
<9-9,Phoebe>乔伊  谢谢你  她玩得很开心
<9-9,Phoebe>And thanks Joey she's having a really great time.

399
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,280
<9-10,Chandler>是乔伊吗  我要跟他说
<9-10,Chandler>Is that Joey? Is that Joey? Let me talk to him! I wanna talk to him!

400
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:31,350
<9-11,Phoebe>乔伊  钱德勒在这里  他想...
<9-11,Phoebe>Okay Joey? Chandler's here, he was wondering...

401
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:35,030
<9-11,Phoebe>我想他硬币正好用完了
<9-11,Phoebe>Okay, I guess he ran out of change.

402
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:37,710
<9-12,Chandler>他连话都不想跟我说
<9-12,Chandler>Y'know, he won't even talk to me.

403
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,040
<9-12,Chandler>这样我要怎么跟他道歉
<9-12,Chandler>How am I going to apologize to him if he won't even talk to me?

404
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,160
<9-13,Monica>或许你应该寄点东西给他
<9-13,Monica>Well, maybe you should send him something.

405
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:44,720
<9-13,Monica>等他到了赌城  就知道你想表达歉意了
<9-13,Monica>So that when he gets to Las Vegas he'll know that you're sorry.

406
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:48,740
<9-14,Chandler>好主意  上哪儿找黄片篮呢
<9-14,Chandler>That's a good idea. I wonder where I could get a basket of porn...

407
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,170
<9-15,Phoebe>不要  不要用黄片道歉啦
<9-15,Phoebe>No, don't-don't say I'm sorry with porn!

408
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:53,990
<9-16,Chandler>是吗
<9-16,Chandler>Really?

409
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,860
<9-17,Phoebe>你应该寄一条烟过去
<9-17,Phoebe>Y'know what you should send him? A cartoon of cigarettes.

410
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:59,060
<9-17,Phoebe>他可以用来换取保护
<9-17,Phoebe>'Cause that why he could trade it for protection.

411
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:01,220
<9-17,Phoebe>错了  监狱里才是这样
<9-17,Phoebe>No. That's prison.

412
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:07,240
<9-18,Ross>菲比  我知道要怎么找出原因
<9-18,Ross>Okay Pheebs, I know how we're going to figure this out.

413
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:09,450
<9-18,Ross>好的  什么都不要想
<9-18,Ross>Okay, clear your mind

414
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:13,330
<9-18,Ross>想到什么就直接回答  好了吗
<9-18,Ross>and answer the first thing that comes into your head. Okay?

415
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:16,350
<9-20,Ross>你更喜欢什么  植物还是动物
<9-20,Ross>What do you like better flora or fauna?

416
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,180
<9-21,Phoebe>动物
<9-21,Phoebe>Fauna.

417
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,430
<9-22,Ross>你想当谁  西蒙还是葛芬柯(二人演唱组合)
<9-22,Ross>Who would you rather be Simon or Garfunkle?

418
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:18,990
<9-23,Phoebe>葛芬柯
<9-23,Phoebe>Garfunkle.

419
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:19,740
<9-24,Ross>你为何生我的气
<9-24,Ross>Why are you mad at me?

420
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:21,410
<9-25,Phoebe>因为你说我很无趣
<9-25,Phoebe>You said I was boring--Ohh!

421
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,940
<9-26,Ross>我何时说过你无趣了
<9-26,Ross>When did I say you were boring?!

422
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:29,280
<9-27,Phoebe>天啊  我想起来了  我们下国际象棋那次
<9-27,Phoebe>Oh my God, I remember now! We were playing chess!

423
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:32,570
<9-28,Ross>菲比  我和你从没下过国际象棋
<9-28,Ross>Phoebe! You and I have never played chess!

424
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:35,630
<9-29,Phoebe>有啦  记得冰冻湖那次吗
<9-29,Phoebe>Oh, come on! Yes, remember that time on the frozen lake?

425
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,900
<9-29,Phoebe>我们下国际象棋  你说我很无趣
<9-29,Phoebe>We were playing chess, you said I was boring,

426
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,830
<9-29,Phoebe>然后你脱下面具  变成了卡梅隆·迪亚兹
<9-29,Phoebe>and then you took off your energy mask and you were Cameron Diaz!

427
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,220
<9-29,Phoebe>好吧  这有可能是梦境
<9-29,Phoebe>Okay, there's a chance this may have been a dream.
