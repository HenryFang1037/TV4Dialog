00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,090
<6-7,Monica>忘记地铁那个蠢妞

00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,330
<6-8,Rachel>那女生的确傻里傻气
<6-8,Rachel>She was kinda stupid.

159
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,730
<7-3,Joey>我认为这个角色很"多疑"
<7-3,Joey>Because I think this character is going to be suspicious about stuff.

160
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,350
<7-4,Chandler>太好了
<7-4,Chandler>Yes!

<7-7,Joey>Don't stop! Move the bowl further away!

165
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:26,250
<7-7,Joey>这么近连罗斯都投得进
<7-7,Joey>Ross could make that shot!

166
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:35,760
<7-8,Joey>你水平很臭  不过至少在玩男人的游戏了
<7-8,Joey>Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now.

167
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:37,760
<7-9,Chandler>想玩吗
<7-9,Chandler>You wanna play?

<7-10,Joey>And I have to write five whole pages

170
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,720
<7-10,Joey>就赶不上他的计划了

<7-11,Chandler>那先玩三十分钟
<7-11,Chandler>Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes

172
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:47,530
<7-11,Chandler>然后写到他回来
<7-11,Chandler>and then write until he gets home.

173
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:49,140
<7-11,Chandler>好
<7-11,Chandler>All right!

<11-22,Rachel>But, I guess that's normal?

250
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:14,170
<11-23,Monica>我们现在不会这样了
<11-23,Monica>We don't, we don't wrestle now.

251
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,250
<11-24,Ross>自从我强过你就不打了
<11-24,Ross>Yeah, not since I got too strong for you.

252
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,850
<11-25,Monica>-强过我  -是的
<11-25,Monica>- Too strong for me? - Yeah.

253
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,680
<11-26,Ross>你现在要比划一下吗
<11-26,Ross>You wanna go right now?

254
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:27,280
<11-27,Monica>我可以立刻打败你  信不信
<11-27,Monica>'Cause I'll take you right now, buddy! You wanna go?

255
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:30,440
<11-28,Ross>没问题
<11-28,Ross>Oh fine.

256
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:35,350
<11-29,Monica>预备  开打
<11-29,Monica>Ready? Wrestle!

257
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:42,280
<11-30,Rachel>知道吗
<11-30,Rachel>Okay, y'know what uh,

258
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:44,410
<11-30,Rachel>非常好  你们帮了大忙  多谢
<11-30,Rachel>actually, that's great. That helps a lot. Thanks.

259
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,970
<12-1,Chandler>兄弟们  赶快走
<12-1,Chandler>Guys, come on! Let's go!

260
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,900
<12-1,Chandler>冰球比赛再过二十分钟就开始了  快走  乔伊
<12-1,Chandler>The puck drops in 20 minutes! Come on, Joe!

261
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:54,510
<12-2,Ross>乔伊不能去
<12-2,Ross>Joey's not going.

262
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,630
<12-3,Joey>我还没写完五页
<12-3,Joey>I didn't finish my five pages.

263
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:00,040
<12-4,Chandler>明天再写不就成了
<12-4,Chandler>Well, why can't you do them tomorrow?

264
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:03,000
<12-5,Ross>因为他明天要修改昨天的五页
<12-5,Ross>Because tomorrow he's redoing yesterday's pages.

265
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,620
<12-6,Joey>我昨天写的有待改进
<12-6,Joey>Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work.

266
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,890
<12-7,Chandler>别再逼他了  行吗
<12-7,Chandler>Why don't you cut him a little slack? Okay?

267
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:11,340
<12-7,Chandler>让他放松可能会写得更好
<12-7,Chandler>Maybe if he relaxes a little bit, he'll get some work done.

268
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:16,260
<12-8,Ross>他已经够放松的了  这要感谢你和大火球
<12-8,Ross>I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you and Fireball.

269
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,370
<12-9,Joey>兄弟  如果你认为大火球很轻松
<12-9,Joey>Dude, if you think Fireball's relaxing,

270
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,920
<12-9,Joey>显然你没玩过
<12-9,Joey>you've obviously have never played.

271
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:24,010
<12-10,Chandler>你这样对待乔伊
<12-10,Chandler>The only reason you're doing this to Joey

272
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,120
<12-10,Chandler>是因为你自己没事做
<12-10,Chandler>is because you're bored.

273
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:27,000
<12-10,Chandler>又不是乔伊害你失业的
<12-10,Chandler>Okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed.

274
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:30,090
<12-11,Ross>我不是失业  只是休假
<12-11,Ross>I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!

275
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,650
<12-12,Joey>你们别吵架
<12-12,Joey>Come on look guys, don't fight.

276
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:36,550
<12-13,Ross>我之所以这么做  是因为我是乔伊的朋友
<12-13,Ross>And the reason I'm doing this is because I am Joey's friend.

277
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,570
<12-13,Ross>如果你也是他朋友  就该学学我
<12-13,Ross>And if you were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing.

278
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:42,110
<12-14,Chandler>当朋友就得这么混帐吗
<12-14,Chandler>Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?

279
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,750
<12-15,Ross>要是真如你所说  你可真是我第一号好友
<12-15,Ross>If it does? Then you're an amazing friend of mine.

280
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,980
<12-15,Ross>别吵了
<12-15,Ross>Hey-hey guys, hey!

281
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:48,710
<12-16,Joey>大家玩场大火球友谊赛来解决吧
<12-16,Joey>How about we settle this over a friendly game of Fireball? Huh?

282
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,270
<12-16,Joey>我去拆掉烟雾报警器
<12-16,Joey>I'll go unhook the smoke detectors!

283
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,650
<12-17,Ross>现在来个了结
<12-17,Ross>How about we settle this right now!

284
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:56,860
<12-17,Ross>好了  谁也别想去看比赛
<12-17,Ross>There! Now, no one's going to the game.

285
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,300
<12-18,Chandler>票是我花钱买的
<12-18,Chandler>I paid for those tickets!

286
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:01,800
<12-19,Ross>不是  你总说会掏钱  可从没兑现过
<12-19,Ross>No you didn't. You said you would, but you never did!

287
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:02,550
<12-20,Chandler>是的
<12-20,Chandler>Oh yeah!

288
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:12,130
<13-1,Danny>我们终于爬到了山顶
<13-1,Danny>...so we finally get to the top of the mountain

289
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:15,790
<13-1,Danny>而这个笨蛋  居然忘了带相机
<13-1,Danny>and airhead here forgets the camera!

290
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:18,450
<13-2,Joey>我也做过这样的傻事
<13-2,Joey>Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time.

291
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:22,060
<13-3,Chandler>什么时候的事
<13-3,Chandler>When did that happen to you?!

292
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:25,860
<13-4,Joey>记得吗  我们在公园慢跑
<13-4,Joey>Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park

293
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:28,490
<13-4,Joey>碰到只可爱的小鸟  我想拍张照片
<13-4,Joey>and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a picture-

294
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,570
<13-4,Joey>可竟然没带相机
<13-4,Joey>I didn't have my camera!

295
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:33,000
<13-5,Chandler>首先  追油炸饼小贩可不是慢跑
<13-5,Chandler>First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging.

296
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:37,630
<13-6,Krista>超好吃  你一定要吃一口
<13-6,Krista>Oh, this is so good you have got to try it.

297
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:51,610
<13-7,Danny>糟糕  裤子弄脏了
<13-7,Danny>Oh, damn! I got it on my pants.

298
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,740
<13-8,Krista>我来擦
<13-8,Krista>Here, I'll get it.

299
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,790
<13-9,Krista>最好上楼换条裤子  否则以后洗不掉
<13-9,Krista>We'd better take these pants off upstairs or that stain's gonna set.

300
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,590
<13-10,Danny>是的  今晚和你约会我打算穿这个
<13-10,Danny>Yep. I'm gonna wear these on our date tonight.

301
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,600
<13-11,Rachel>真好
<13-11,Rachel>Oh, great!

302

<13-15,Joey>Yeah, wow, sorry Rach.

306
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:18,300
<13-16,Chandler>我不相信他们是兄妹
<13-16,Chandler>I don't believe they're brother and sister.

307
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,880
<13-17,Joey>他们是兄妹吗
<13-17,Joey>They're brother and sister!!!

309
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,680
<14-1,Phoebe>等一下  手张开给我检查
<14-1,Phoebe>Wait a minute, open up your hand; let me take a look.

<14-1,Phoebe>What's this? A Canadian coin?

313

<14-2,Phoebe>Set it down over there and then you can make a contribution!

316
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:57,740
<14-2,Phoebe>少装一副可怜兮兮的样子
<14-2,Phoebe>And you can leave the hurt bunny look over there too!

317
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:02,620
<14-2,Phoebe>嗨  鲍伯  不是叫你走开了吗
<14-2,Phoebe>Hi Bob! I thought I told you to get outta here!

<14-3,Bob>我们会把你派到显略低调的地方
<14-3,Bob>and uh, we're gonna move you to a less high-profile spot.

320

<14-5,Bob>-什么  -以后这里由金洁负责
<14-5,Bob>- What?! - Umm, Ginger's gonna take over this corner.

00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,220
<14-6,Phoebe>这个小妞没法混这里
<14-6,Phoebe>That chick can't handle my corner.

322
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:19,910
<14-7,Bob>你不走  我们就得赶你走
<14-7,Bob>Look, either you leave, or we remove you.

323
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:21,790
<14-7,Bob>好
<14-7,Bob>Fine.

324
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:31,160
<14-8,Phoebe>劝你一句  注意那个臭婆娘
<14-8,Phoebe>All right, I'll give you one pointer. Look out for that bitch.

325
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:43,620
<15-1,Danny>瑞秋  不是约七点吗
<15-1,Danny>Oh, hey Rach! I thought we said seven?

<15-2,Rachel>Yeah uh, y'know what uh, let's skip it.

327
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:48,190
<15-3,Danny>什么  为什么
<15-3,Danny>What?! Why?!

328
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,670
<15-4,Rachel>你们兄妹似乎...
<15-4,Rachel>Umm, you-you and your sister seem to have

329
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,210
<15-4,Rachel>非常要好
<15-4,Rachel>umm, a very special bond, and...

330
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:56,350
<15-5,Danny>这下可好  又是这句话
<15-5,Danny>Oh great! That special bond again!

331
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,620
<15-5,Danny>我跟我妹感情好
<15-5,Danny>Why do women have such a problem

332
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:01,630
<15-5,Danny>为什么总让女人看不顺眼呢
<15-5,Danny>with the fact that I'm close with my sister?

333
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,980
<15-6,Rachel>我不知道  听着
<15-6,Rachel>Well, okay, look. I don't know, listen,

334
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:04,380
<15-6,Rachel>我不知道具体情况  但是
<15-6,Rachel>I don't know what's going on here but let's...

335
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:05,760
<15-7,Danny>你有兄弟吗
<15-7,Danny>Do-do you, do you have brothers?

336
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:07,670
<15-8,Rachel>没  我有两个妹妹
<15-8,Rachel>No, I have two sisters.

337
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,730
<15-8,Rachel>其中一个很像男人婆
<15-8,Rachel>But one of them has a very masculine energy.

338
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,110
<15-9,Danny>你们要好吗
<15-9,Danny>Are you close with them?

339
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,240
<15-10,Rachel>不  她们不是什么好人
<15-10,Rachel>No-no, they're not very nice people.

340
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:19,730
<15-11,Danny>听我说  我很喜欢你
<15-11,Danny>Okay, listen, I really like you. Okay?

341
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,200
<15-11,Danny>我觉得我们可以顺利交住下去
<15-11,Danny>I think this can go somewhere.

342
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,230
<15-11,Danny>我跟家人感情深厚
<15-11,Danny>So what if I'm close to my family,

343
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,060
<15-11,Danny>你就为了这点不理我吗
<15-11,Danny>are you gonna let that stand in the way of us?

344
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,730
<15-12,Rachel>我也不知道
<15-12,Rachel>Well, uh, I-I don't know.

345
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,660
<15-12,Rachel>听你这么说也有道理
<15-12,Rachel>See when-when you put it that way y'know it does sort of...

346
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:33,830
<15-13,Krista>丹尼  快点  洗澡水快凉了
<15-13,Krista>Danny! Hurry up! The bath is getting cold!

<16-1,Chandler>街上有小孩在玩耍
<16-1,Chandler>There's some kids playing in the street,

349
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,040
<16-1,Chandler>你要不要去叫他们写作业  毁了他们的一天
<16-1,Chandler>you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day?

350
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:54,660
<16-2,Ross>如果他们手边有球  你就可以插上剃刀
<16-2,Ross>Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it

351
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:57,790
<16-2,Ross>教他们玩新游戏  "把球缝补好"
<16-2,Ross>and teach them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball.

352
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:02,960
<16-3,Joey>兄弟们  我整个早上都待在图书馆
<16-3,Joey>Hey guys! I was at the library all morning

<16-6,Joey>不行  门票被罗斯撕掉了
<16-6,Joey>No dude, Ross tore up the tickets!

356
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,360
<16-7,Ross>看来没有让你分心的事情
<16-7,Ross>I guess when you don't have so many distractions,

357
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,460
<16-7,Ross>就比较容易专心吧
<16-7,Ross>it's easier for you to focus. Huh?

358
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:25,130
<16-8,Chandler>没人整天跟在你屁股后面说三道四
<16-8,Chandler>Yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck

359
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,600
<16-8,Chandler>也比较得心应手吧
<16-8,Chandler>all the live long day!!

360
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,800
<16-9,Joey>随你们说吧
<16-9,Joey>Yeah, well, that's fine,

361
