9
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,240
<1-10,Monica>那是你乱编的名字吗
<1-10,Monica>Honey, is that something you're making up?

10
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:33,410
<1-10,Monica>不  真有这个奖

<1-11,Joey>瑞秋  我被提名肥皂奖了
<1-11,Joey>Hey, Rach! I'm up for a Soapie!

<1-13,Joey>谢谢  我知道该带谁参加颁奖典礼了
<1-13,Joey>Thank you! I guess we know who I'll take to the awards!

16
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:54,460
<1-14,Rachel>别跟我开这种玩笑  各路明星都会去吗
<1-14,Rachel>Stop that! Don't kid about that! Will all the stars be there?

00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:56,570
<1-15,Joey>很多明星都说他们会去

<1-17,Monica>-那就换我去吧  -不行

<1-18,Rachel>你都要结婚了  我就只能靠颁奖礼乐呵乐呵了
<1-18,Rachel>You're getting married. This is all I have.

32
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,780
<2-1,Ross>恩斯特·穆伯拉特首先猜测
<2-1,Ross>And it was Ernst Muhlbrat who first hypothesized

33
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:54,010
<2-1,Ross>迅猛龙受到威胁时  会把颈部肌肉张开
<2-1,Ross>that the Velociraptor, when threatened, would expand it's collar

34
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:56,530
<2-1,Ross>发出尖锐的叫声...
<2-1,Ross>and emit a high-pitched noise...

35
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:58,760
<2-1,Ross>将敌人吓跑
<2-1,Ross>...to frighten off predators.

36
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,230
<2-2,Lewis>路易斯  什么事
<2-2,Lewis>Yes, Mr. Lewis?

37
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:02,440
<2-2,Lewis>什么样的叫声
<2-2,Lewis>What kind of noise?

38
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:07,230
<2-3,Ross>就是一种尖锐  骇人的声音
<2-3,Ross>Just a high-pitched, intimidating noise.

39
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,970
<2-4,Lewis>那到底是什么样子
<2-4,Lewis>But like how?

40
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:12,660
<2-5,Ross>我们并不确定
<2-5,Ross>Well, we don't know for sure.

41
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:17,240
<2-5,Ross>但我想  应该是这样的
<2-5,Ross>But in my head, it sounded something like this:

42
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:33,940
<2-5,Ross>当然  这只是种猜侧
<2-5,Ross>Of course, this is just conjecture.

43
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:39,560
<2-5,Ross>好了  今天的课上到这里
<2-5,Ross>Okay. That's all for today.

44
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:43,460
<2-5,Ross>摩斯  我能跟你谈谈吗
<2-5,Ross>Mr. Morse, can I see you for a moment?

45
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:47,650
<2-6,Morse>什么事  教授
<2-6,Morse>Yes, sir?

46
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:51,300
<2-7,Ross>我得跟你谈谈你的期中考成绩
<2-7,Ross>Mr. Morse, I need to talk to you about your midterm exam.

47
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,990
<2-7,Ross>-恐怕我得把你当掉  -为什么
<2-7,Ross>- I'm afraid I had to fail you. - Why?

48
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,410
<2-9,Ross>你得答对69%才能及格
<2-9,Ross>Well, you need 60% to pass.

49
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:01,450
<2-10,Morse>-我的分数是多少  -七分
<2-10,Morse>- What did I get? - Seven.

50
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,720
<2-12,Morse>那可不太理想
<2-12,Morse>That's not so good.

51
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:07,200
<2-12,Morse>对  很不理想
<2-12,Morse>No, no, it's not.

52
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,590
<2-13,Ross>奈德  到底发生了什么事
<2-13,Ross>What happened, Ned?

53
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,990
<2-14,Morse>希望你可以饶我一次
<2-14,Morse>Maybe you can cut me some slack.

54
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,370
<2-14,Morse>我恋爱了
<2-14,Morse>I'm sort of in love.

55
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:18,420
<2-15,Ross>抱歉  但那不是我的问题
<2-15,Ross>I'm sorry, but that's really not my problem.

56
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:20,670
<2-16,Morse>我爱上了你
<2-16,Morse>I'm in love with you.

57
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,260
<2-17,Ross>那好像跟我有一点关系
<2-17,Ross>That brings me in the loop a little.

58
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,760
<2-18,Morse>所以我才会考那么烂
<2-18,Morse>That's why I did so bad on this test.

59
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,920
<2-18,Morse>我没办法专心上课
<2-18,Morse>I'm having a hard time concentrating.

60
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,020
<2-18,Morse>你站在讲台上讲课的时候...
<2-18,Morse>When you're up there and you're teaching...

61
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,880
<2-18,Morse>表情是那么地严肃...
<2-18,Morse>...and your face gets all serious...

62
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,990
<2-18,Morse>你看起来好帅
<2-18,Morse>You look so good.

63
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,720
<2-18,Morse>当你穿着紧身高领毛衣的时候
<2-18,Morse>When you wear that tight little turtleneck sweater...

64
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,280
<2-18,Morse>好了
<2-18,Morse>Okay.

65
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,360
<2-19,Ross>我是你的老师  对不起
<2-19,Ross>I'm your teacher. I'm sorry.

66
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,110
<2-19,Ross>你是学生
<2-19,Ross>You're a student.

67
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:53,640
<2-19,Ross>而且我喜欢女人
<2-19,Ross>And I like women.

68
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:57,210
<2-19,Ross>虽然有人在椅背上不是这么写的
<2-19,Ross>In spite of what may be written on the backs of these chairs.

69
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,260
<2-19,Ross>天啊
<2-19,Ross>Oh, my god.

70
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:05,830
<3-1,Phoebe>吧台那个男人在看你
<3-1,Phoebe>That guy at the counter's totally checking you out.

71
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:06,960
<3-2,Monica>真的吗
<3-2,Monica>Really?

72
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:11,450
<3-2,Monica>-天啊  他真的好帅  -上吧
<3-2,Monica>- Oh, my God, he's really cute! - Go for it.

73
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,290
<3-4,Monica>菲比  我订婚了
<3-4,Monica>Phoebe, I'm engaged.

74
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:17,100
<3-5,Phoebe>我建议你去问他要电话号码  以防万一
<3-5,Phoebe>I'm just saying, get his number, just in case.

75
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:22,560
<3-5,Phoebe>说不定钱德勒发生意外  丧失了性能力
<3-5,Phoebe>But if Chandler's in an accident and can't perform sexually...

76
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,760
<3-5,Phoebe>他想让你找个情人
<3-5,Phoebe>...he'd want you to take a lover

77
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,280
<3-5,Phoebe>帮他满足你的生理需求
<3-5,Phoebe>to satisfy needs he'd no longer fulfill.

78
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,660
<3-7,Monica>我能跟你说句话吗
<3-7,Monica>Can I just tell you something?

79
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:38,620
<3-7,Monica>我真的受宠若惊  但我订婚了
<3-7,Monica>I'm very flattered, but I'm engaged.

80
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:42,580
<3-8,The Cute Guy>这话说来有点难为情
<3-8,The Cute Guy>This is kind of embarrassing.

81
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:45,660
<3-8,The Cute Guy>事实上  我是想跟你朋友说话
<3-8,The Cute Guy>I actually came over to talk to your friend.

82
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,060
<3-9,Monica>你确实应该觉得难为情
<3-9,Monica>You should be embarrassed.

83
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,410
<3-10,The Cute Guy>我还以为你知道我是在看你
<3-10,The Cute Guy>I thought you knew I was looking at you.

84
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:57,710
<3-11,Phoebe>我知道  不过耍她真的很好玩
<3-11,Phoebe>I did, but that was really fun.

85
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:03,350
<3-11,Phoebe>"得奖的是...乔伊·崔比安尼"
<3-11,Phoebe>"The winner is... Joey Tribbiani!"

86
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:11,660
<4-1,Joey>我真的没想到我会得奖...
<4-1,Joey>"I honestly never expected this.

87
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:14,910
<4-1,Joey>我没有准备演讲稿...
<4-1,Joey>I didn't prepare a speech.

88
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:19,530
<4-1,Joey>我要谢谢我的父母  他们一直支持我...
<4-1,Joey>I'd like to thank my parents, who've always been there for me.

89
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:21,330
<4-1,Joey>我还要谢谢我的朋友
<4-1,Joey>Also like to thank my friends,

90

00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,630
<4-2,Rachel>-我才排第四  -天啊
<4-2,Rachel>- I'm fourth? - Jeez!

92
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:31,620
<4-2,Rachel>瞧你啊  拿着枫糖瓶当奖杯
<4-2,Rachel>Look at you with your maple syrup award!

93
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:33,920
<4-3,Joey>拜托你别把这事告诉别人
<4-3,Joey>Maybe you don't tell anyone about this?

94
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:38,140
<4-4,Rachel>那没什么大不了  我也会拿洗发水瓶当奖杯
<4-4,Rachel>It's not a big deal. I do that too, with my shampoo bottle.

95
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,430
<4-5,Joey>-真的吗  -没错
<4-5,Joey>- Really? - Yeah.

96
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,620
<4-7,Joey>-你假装自己得了什么奖  -葛莱美奖
<4-7,Joey>- What award are you practicing for? - Grammy.

97
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:45,580
<4-8,Rachel>我是最佳新进艺人
<4-8,Rachel>For Best New Artist.

98
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,220
<4-9,Joey>肥皂奖的人今天打电话给我
<4-9,Joey>Listen. The Soapies people called today.

99
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,700
<4-9,Joey>我还得上台颁奖
<4-9,Joey>I also get to present an award.

100
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:55,700
<4-10,Rachel>所以就算你没得奖  你也有机会上台
<4-10,Rachel>That's great. So you'll get on stage even if you don't win.

101
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:01,740
<4-12,Rachel>-你觉得我不会得奖  -你当然会得奖
<4-12,Rachel>- You don't think I'll win? - Of course I do.

102
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:05,220
<4-13,Joey>但最受欢迎死而复生奖
<4-13,Joey>But Favorite Returning Character?

103
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,270
<4-14,Rachel>那个奖项竞争很激烈
<4-14,Rachel>That's a tough category, Joey.

104
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:10,800
<4-14,Rachel>你要跟一个火葬了之后还能活过来的人竞争
<4-14,Rachel>You're up against the guy who survived his own cremation.

105
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:14,720
<4-15,Joey>不  我知道自己或许不会得奖  只是...
<4-15,Joey>No, I know I might not win. But it's just...

106
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:18,220
<4-15,Joey>我从来没有被提过名  我真的很想得奖
<4-15,Joey>I've never been nominated before. I want it so much.

107
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,000
<4-16,Rachel>或许你会得奖
<4-16,Rachel>You'll probably get it.

108
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,350
<4-16,Rachel>但你应该开始练习"输得起"的表情了
<4-16,Rachel>But you should start practicing your "gracious-loser" face.

109
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,420
<4-16,Rachel>当摄影机拍到你时  你得表现出失望的样子
<4-16,Rachel>When the cameras are on you, you want to look disappointed.

110
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,670
<4-16,Rachel>但也要摆出对方是实至名归的表情
<4-16,Rachel>But also that your colleague deserved to win.

111
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:31,640
<12-4,Joey>就像这样
<12-4,Joey>It's sort of like:

112
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:37,450
<12-5,Rachel>你知道吗
<12-5,Rachel>You know?

113
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:39,860
<4-19,Joey>你也练习过自己没得到葛莱美奖的情况
<4-19,Joey>You practice losing the Grammys too?

114
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,780
<4-20,Rachel>不  我是葛莱美奖的常胜军
<4-20,Rachel>No, at the Grammys, I always win.

115
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,420
<5-2,Monica>你跟杰克约会还顺利吗
<5-2,Monica>How'd your date go with Jake?

116
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:54,430
<5-3,Phoebe>很不错  我们整晚一直注视着彼此
<5-3,Phoebe>Great. We couldn't keep our eyes off each other all night.

117
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,980
<5-3,Phoebe>每隔一阵子
<5-3,Phoebe>Every once in a while,

118
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:59,730
<5-3,Phoebe>他就会靠过来轻抚我的头发跟脖子
<5-3,Phoebe>he'd lean over, stroke my hair, then touch my neck.

119
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:02,390
<5-4,Monica>住手  菲比  你害得我好痒
<5-4,Monica>Stop it, Phoebe. You're getting me all tingly.

120
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:06,460
<5-5,Phoebe>我心里一直在想  他要吻我了吗
<5-5,Phoebe>All I could think of was, is he gonna kiss me? Is he gonna kiss me?

121
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,210
<5-6,Monica>他吻了你吗
<5-6,Monica>Did he?

122
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:09,570
<5-7,Phoebe>我是个淑女  绝不会泄露这种私事
<5-7,Phoebe>I'm a lady, Monica. I don't kiss and tell.

123
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:11,930
<5-7,Phoebe>但这个吻痕说明了一切
<5-7,Phoebe>But this hickey speaks for itself.

124
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:14,070
<5-8,Monica>好了  我知道了
<5-8,Monica>Okay, I got it. I got it.

125
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:15,950
<5-9,Phoebe>我真的好喜欢他
<5-9,Phoebe>I like him so much,

126
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,430
<5-9,Phoebe>我今天像是喝了十杯酒那么飘飘欲仙

<5-10,Monica>我开始跟钱德勒约会后再也没有那样的感觉了
<5-10,Monica>I haven't had that feeling since I first went out with Chandler.

<5-12,Monica>不  男人会说"我永远都不能再跟别人上床"
<5-12,Monica>No, a guy would say, "I'll never get to sleep with anyone else."

138
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:01,320
<6-2,Joey>所以你才要帮我打领带吗
<6-2,Joey>Is that why you wanted to tie my tie?

139
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:07,310
<6-3,Ross>我班上的学生说他爱上我了
<6-3,Ross>There's a kid in my class who said he's in love with me.

142
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:18,330
<6-7,Ross>我班上有个男学生暗恋我
<6-7,Ross>There's a guy in one of my classes who has a crush on me.

143
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:19,580
<6-8,Rachel>-真的吗  -对
<6-8,Rachel>- Really? - Yeah, I don't know.

<6-9,Ross>去年是伊莉莎白  现在又是这个孩子...
<6-9,Ross>Last year, Elizabeth, now this kid...

145
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:26,490
<6-9,Ross>这是怎么回事  难道我散发出...
<6-9,Ross>What is it? Am I giving out some kind of...

146
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,430
<6-9,Ross>性感教授的气质吗

00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,960
<6-10,Rachel>现在没看出来
<6-10,Rachel>Not right now.

148
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,550
<6-11,Ross>重点是我的天生丽质害他挂了期中考试
<6-11,Ross>The point is, my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm.

149
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:42,070
<6-12,Rachel>我为那孩子感到可惜
<6-12,Rachel>Now I feel bad for the kid.

150

<6-12,Rachel>我也曾经暗恋过老师  真的很难受
<6-12,Rachel>I had a crush on a teacher once, and it was so hard.

151
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:47,120
<6-12,Rachel>我没办法专心上课
<6-12,Rachel>I couldn't concentrate.

152
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,690
<6-12,Rachel>每次他看着我  我都会脸红
<6-12,Rachel>I blushed every time he looked at me.

230
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:43,100
<12-12,Joey>如果我把它摆在那里

231
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,310
<12-12,Joey>大家就会看到  以为我真的得奖了

<12-15,Rachel>这样把奖杯拿回家没有意义
<12-15,Rachel>You don't want to win an award this way.

<12-18,Joey>If I can't have it, you can't have it!

242
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,130
<13-1,Lewis>盖勒教授
<13-1,Lewis>Professor Geller?

243
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,800
<13-2,Ross>路易斯  有什么事吗
<13-2,Ross>Yes, Mr. Lewis? How can I help you?

244
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,000
<13-3,Lewis>我知道我的期中考试没有考好
<13-3,Lewis>I know I didn't do well on my midterms and stuff.

245
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,960
<13-3,Lewis>但我希望你能帮我改成绩
<13-3,Lewis>But I was hoping you could change my grade.

246
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:48,340
<13-4,Ross>我为什么要帮你改
<13-4,Ross>And why, exactly, would I do that?

247
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,800
<13-5,Lewis>因为我爱上你了
<13-5,Lewis>Because I'm in love with you.

248
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:54,660
<13-6,Ross>什么
<13-6,Ross>What?

249
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:59,660
<13-7,Lewis>对  我爱上你了
<13-7,Lewis>Yeah. I'm all in love with you and stuff.

250
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,250
<13-7,Lewis>-你可以帮我改成绩吗  -不行
<13-7,Lewis>- So could you change my grade? - No!

251
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:07,460
<13-9,Lewis>为什么  你都帮奈德改了
<13-9,Lewis>Why not? You changed Ned's grade.

252
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:11,940
<13-10,Ross>那不一样  因为他真的爱上我了
<13-10,Ross>That's different. Because he was actually in love with me.

253
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:15,360
<13-11,Lewis>不  他才没有  他只是在耍你
<13-11,Lewis>No, he's not! He's totally yanking your chain.

254
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,160
<13-11,Lewis>他已经用这一招对付过其他三个教授了
<13-11,Lewis>He's done this with three other teachers.

255
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,970
<13-13,Lewis>-什么  -他有女朋友
<13-13,Lewis>- What? - He's got a girlfriend.

256
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:26,880
<13-14,Ross>我不敢相信有人会为了成绩出此下策
<13-14,Ross>I can't believe someone would do that for a grade.

257
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:28,310
<13-15,Lewis>就是嘛
<13-15,Lewis>I know.

258
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,940
<13-15,Lewis>太不厚道了
<13-15,Lewis>It's awful.

259
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,480
<13-15,Lewis>我爱你
<13-15,Lewis>I love you.

260
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:39,060
<14-1,Monica>你看到钱德勒了吗
<14-1,Monica>- Have you seen Chandler? - No, why?

261
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:42,570
<14-3,Monica>我一直在想我将要失去的一切
<14-3,Monica>I keep thinking about all the things I won't have.

262
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:45,210
<14-3,Monica>我很惶恐  我不知道该怎么办
<14-3,Monica>It's freaking me out. I don't know what to do about it.

263
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,800
<14-4,Phoebe>别担心
<14-4,Phoebe>Don't sweat it.

264
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:48,690
<14-4,Phoebe>钱德勒不在
<14-4,Phoebe>Chandler's not around,

265
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:50,650
<14-4,Phoebe>别管那么多规矩
<14-4,Phoebe>so go ahead and get it out of your system.

266
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,290
<14-4,Phoebe>那个男的很帅
<14-4,Phoebe>That guy's cute.

267
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,680
<14-5,Monica>别这样  我是认真的
<14-5,Monica>Phoebe, come on, I'm serious.

268
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:58,250
<14-5,Monica>我得跟他谈谈这件事
<14-5,Monica>I've got to talk to him about this.

269
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,930
<14-6,Phoebe>这种事怎么能跟他谈呢
<14-6,Phoebe>That's the last thing you want to do.

270
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:04,280
<14-8,Phoebe>-为什么  -因为你要嫁给他了
<14-8,Phoebe>- Why? - Because you're marrying him!

271
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:06,980
<14-9,Monica>你得帮帮我
<14-9,Monica>You gotta help me out here.

272
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:10,940
<14-10,Phoebe>我从来没有订过婚  也没有结过婚
<14-10,Phoebe>I've never been engaged. I've never really been married.

273
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,280
<14-10,Phoebe>我只能告诉你我妈告诫我的话
<14-10,Phoebe>I can only tell you what my mother told me.

274
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:18,640
<14-10,Phoebe>当你对一段关系有疑惑  害怕或焦虑时
<14-10,Phoebe>When you have doubts or fears or anxieties about a relationship...

275
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,420
<14-10,Phoebe>别跟你的丈夫沟通这些问题
<14-10,Phoebe>...don't communicate them to your husband.

276
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:27,080
<14-11,Monica>我不能跟我要共度一生的男人...
<14-11,Monica>I'm not supposed to share my doubts and fears...

277
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,540
<14-11,Monica>分享我的疑惑跟恐惧
<14-11,Monica>...with the guy I'm spending the rest of my life with?

278
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,820
<14-12,Phoebe>没错  就是那样
<14-12,Phoebe>That is correct. Yes.

279
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:35,260
<14-12,Phoebe>你应该把那件事放在心里...
<14-12,Phoebe>You're supposed to put all that stuff in a little box in your mind...

280
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,290
<14-12,Phoebe>永不再提
<14-12,Phoebe>...and lock it up tight.

281
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,400
<14-13,Monica>-那是你妈告诫你的  -对
<14-13,Monica>- Your mother told you this? - Yes.

282
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,300
<14-14,Phoebe>那个结过很多次婚
<14-14,Phoebe>The woman who married a bunch of times

283
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,480
<14-15,Monica>在你十三岁时就自杀的女人
<14-15,Monica>and killed herself when you were 13?

284
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,420
<14-15,Monica>我的天啊  你说得对
<14-15,Monica>Oh, my God, you're right.

285
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:50,590
<14-16,Phoebe>快去告诉钱德勒  快点  免得太迟了
<14-16,Phoebe>Go! Go tell Chandler. Hurry, before it's too late!

286
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:55,570
<14-16,Phoebe>等一下  这表示放荡是得不到真爱的吗
<14-16,Phoebe>Wait! Does this also mean that putting out doesn't get you love?

287
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:04,180
<15-1,Rachel>-我就要见到杰西卡·艾什莉了  -等一下
<15-1,Rachel>- I cannot believe I'm gonna meet Jessica Ashley! - Wait, wait.

00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:32,230

<15-11,Jessica Ashley>Do you have any idea what this means?

298
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:38,460
<15-12,Joey>你不把奖杯摆在柜子里吗
<15-12,Joey>That's it? You're not gonna put it on your shelf or anything?

299
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:41,130
<15-13,Jessica Ashley>不  只有真正的奖杯才配摆在柜子里
<15-13,Jessica Ashley>No, I try to save that for real awards.

300
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:42,920
<15-13,Jessica Ashley>失陪
<15-13,Jessica Ashley>Now if you'll excuse me?

<16-1,Monica>Honey? As we get closer to the wedding...

304
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:03,690
<16-1,Monica>你有什么事想跟我分享吗
<16-1,Monica>...is there anything you'd like to talk about and share?

305
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:07,730
<16-2,Chandler>好吧  我觉得桌上的装饰物太大了
<16-2,Chandler>Okay. I think the centerpieces are too big.

306
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:10,010
<16-3,Monica>才没有  装饰物尺寸刚刚好
<16-3,Monica>You're wrong. The centerpieces are fine.

307
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:14,170
<16-3,Monica>你曾经害怕过吗
<16-3,Monica>Do you ever get scared at all?

308
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,150
<16-4,Chandler>有一点  那玩意真的很大
<16-4,Chandler>Kind of. They're really big.

309
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:19,570
<16-5,Monica>你不害怕自己
<16-5,Monica>Doesn't it ever freak you out

310
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:23,230
<16-5,Monica>没办法再结识新的伴侣吗
<16-5,Monica>that you'll never be with anybody new again?

311
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:25,470
<16-6,Chandler>什么
<16-6,Chandler>What?

312
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:28,620
<16-6,Chandler>我非常爱你
<16-6,Chandler>I love you so much.

313
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:33,550
<16-7,Monica>我一想到不会再有心动的感觉就觉得难过
<16-7,Monica>Sometimes it bothers me that I'll never have that feeling.

314
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,730
<16-7,Monica>当你刚刚认识一个人
<16-7,Monica>When you meet someone for the first time

315
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:39,950
<16-7,Monica>会觉得新鲜刺激  你知道那种心动的感觉吗
<16-7,Monica>...and it's new and exciting. You know that rush?

316
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:41,450
<16-7,Monica>不
<16-7,Monica>No.

317
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,230
<16-8,Chandler>不  当我刚刚认识一个人...
<16-8,Chandler>No, when I first meet somebody...

318
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:49,650
<16-8,Chandler>我会觉得慌张  焦虑  满头大汗
<16-8,Chandler>...it's mostly panic, anxiety and a great deal of sweating.

319
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,500
<16-9,Monica>好吧  但你是男人
<16-9,Monica>Okay. But you're a guy.

320
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:57,820
<16-9,Monica>你不害怕你永远不能再跟别人上床吗
<16-9,Monica>Does it not freak out that you'll never sleep with anybody else?

321
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,980
<16-10,Chandler>不能跟别人上床  不
<16-10,Chandler>Sleeping with somebody, no.

322
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,330
<16-10,Chandler>我害怕的是焦虑  慌张  满头大汗
<16-10,Chandler>Anxiety, panic and, I'm afraid, even more sweating.

323
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,090
<16-11,Monica>即使是我跟在一起
<16-11,Monica>Even with me?

324
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:08,800
<16-12,Chandler>我们刚开始交往的六个月
<16-12,Chandler>I was dangerously dehydrated

325
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,550
<16-12,Chandler>我严重脱水
<16-12,Chandler>the first six months of our relationship.

326
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,230
<16-12,Chandler>对我来说
<16-12,Chandler>For me, the rush is knowing

327
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:18,500
<16-12,Chandler>一想到我们会共度余生就觉得心动
<16-12,Chandler>that we'll be together the rest of our lives.

328
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:22,060
<16-14,Chandler>-真的吗  -对
<16-14,Chandler>- Really? - Well, yeah.

329
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,690
<16-14,Chandler>但知道你有这些想法
<16-14,Chandler>But now that I know that you're having these thoughts,

330
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:27,560
<16-14,Chandler>我又找回了慌张  焦虑跟...
<16-14,Chandler>we're back to panic, anxiety and...

331
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,280
<16-14,Chandler>我真的需要喝点运动饮料
<16-14,Chandler>...I'll definitely need some kind of sports drink.

332
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:36,070
<16-15,Monica>过来  你不必担心
<16-15,Monica>Come here. Oh, you don't have to worry.

333
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:39,160
<16-15,Monica>而且你知道吗
<16-15,Monica>Besides, you know what?

334
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,400
<16-15,Monica>跟你在一起  我一定会惊喜不断
<16-15,Monica>I'll have a lot of new things with you.

335
