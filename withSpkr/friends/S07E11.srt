1
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:08,310
<1-3,Chandler>你得试试这块芝士蛋糕
<1-3,Chandler>You have got to try this cheesecake.

2
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,280
<1-4,Rachel>我不是那么喜欢吃甜食
<1-4,Rachel>You know, I'm not that much of a sweet tooth...

3
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:14,810
<1-4,Rachel>天啊  好香浓
<1-4,Rachel>Oh, my God, it's so creamy!

4
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:18,190
<1-4,Rachel>那是我吃过最棒的芝士蛋糕
<1-4,Rachel>That's the best cheesecake I've ever had!

5
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,120
<1-4,Rachel>你在哪里买
<1-4,Rachel>Where did you get this?

6
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:22,610
<1-5,Chandler>我回家时它就已经放在门口了
<1-5,Chandler>It was at the front door when I got home.

7
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:24,340
<1-5,Chandler>有人寄给我们的
<1-5,Chandler>Somebody sent it to us.

8
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:27,360
<1-6,Rachel>你不是收件人
<1-6,Rachel>This isn't addressed to you.

9
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:30,860
<1-6,Rachel>收件人是楼下的布雷曼太太
<1-6,Rachel>This is addressed to Mrs. Braverman downstairs!

10
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,630
<1-6,Rachel>小偷
<1-6,Rachel>Thief!

11
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,940
<1-7,Chandler>我没看收件人姓名就打开了盒子
<1-7,Chandler>I didn't read the box before I opened it...

12
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,800
<1-7,Chandler>盒子已经打开了就无法退还
<1-7,Chandler>...and you can't return a box after you opened it!

13
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:42,140
<1-9,Chandler>-为什么  -因为太好吃了
<1-9,Chandler>- Why not? - Because it's too delicious!

14
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,370
<1-10,Rachel>你偷了人家的蛋糕  这是不对的
<1-10,Rachel>You stole this cheesecake. That's wrong.

15
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:48,750
<1-11,Chandler>不  没关系的
<1-11,Chandler>No, it'll be okay

16
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,210
<1-11,Chandler>因为布雷曼太太会免费再收到一个
<1-11,Chandler>because Mrs. Braverman will send away for a free one.

17
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:53,190
<1-11,Chandler>那可是双赢
<1-11,Chandler>That way, we all win.

18
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:57,350
<1-11,Chandler>唯一的输家是大型芝士蛋糕店
<1-11,Chandler>The only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate...

19
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,100
<1-11,Chandler>"小妈妈的面包店"
<1-11,Chandler>..."Mama's Little Bakery."

20
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,690
<1-11,Chandler>我觉得好难过
<1-11,Chandler>I feel terrible.

21
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:05,400
<1-11,Chandler>我是个大坏蛋
<1-11,Chandler>I'm a horrible, horrible person.

22
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,400
<1-12,Rachel>我很抱歉  什么
<1-12,Rachel>I'm sorry, what?

34
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,410
<2-1,Joey>我得走了  我今天工作很忙
<2-1,Joey>I should get going. Big day at work.

35
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:54,720
<2-1,Joey>你们知道我怎么会昏迷不醒吗
<2-1,Joey>You know how I'm in a coma?

36
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:58,990
<2-1,Joey>今天他们帮我做检查  结果发现我没有脑死
<2-1,Joey>Today they do a test on me and it turns out I'm not brain-dead.

37
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:00,990
<2-2,Chandler>所以
<2-2,Chandler>So...

38
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,790
<2-3,Joey>机灵鬼先生
<2-3,Joey>Mr. Smarty Pants.

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,400
<2-3,Joey>是我演的角色没有脑死
<2-3,Joey>It's just my character that's not brain-dead.

40
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:08,300
<2-3,Joey>菲比  今晚的事没取消吧
<2-3,Joey>Pheebs, still on for tonight?

41
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,810
<2-5,Joey>-没啊  -那8点见
<2-5,Joey>- Absolutely. - I'll see you at 8.

42
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:12,600
<2-7,Chandler>8点要干嘛
<2-7,Chandler>What's at 8?

43
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:14,560
<2-8,Phoebe>我和乔伊有约
<2-8,Phoebe>We have dinner plans with Joey.

44
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,720
<2-8,Phoebe>我们一月聚一次  八卦一下剩下的人
<2-8,Phoebe>We get together about once a month to discuss the rest of you.

45
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:21,150
<2-9,Ross>我还真的不知道
<2-9,Ross>Wow! Did not know that.

46
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:23,910
<2-9,Ross>我能说你今天看起来很漂亮吗
<2-9,Ross>May I say how lovely you look today?

47
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,180
<2-10,Phoebe>注意到了啊
<2-10,Phoebe>Duly noted.

48
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:27,970
<2-11,Ross>明天
<2-11,Ross>So for tomorrow,

49
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:30,760
<2-11,Ross>你要租辆车一起开过去吗
<2-11,Ross>do you want to rent a car and drive down together?

50
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:32,370
<2-12,Monica>你在说什么
<2-12,Monica>What are you talking about?

51
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:34,560
<2-13,Ross>芬妮表妹的婚礼  明晚
<2-13,Ross>Cousin Frannie's wedding. Tomorrow night.

52
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:38,000
<2-14,Monica>你被邀请了
<2-14,Monica>You were invited?

53
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,700
<2-15,Ross>没啊
<2-15,Ross>No.

54
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,210
<2-15,Ross>天啊  我简直不敢相信
<2-15,Ross>Oh, my God, I can't believe this.

55
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,840
<2-16,Monica>我以为他们只邀请了爸跟妈
<2-16,Monica>I thought only Mom and Dad were invited.

56
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,210
<2-16,Monica>七岁到九岁  芬妮跟我形影不离
<2-16,Monica>From the ages of 7 to 9, Frannie and I were inseparable.

57
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:54,250
<2-17,Chandler>或许九岁后  芬妮交了新朋友
<2-17,Chandler>Maybe since the age of 9, Frannie's made some new friends.

58
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:58,820
<2-18,Ross>大概是误会吧  我去给雪儿阿姨打电话
<2-18,Ross>It's probably just a mistake. Let me call Aunt Cheryl.

59
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:02,190
<2-18,Ross>或许他们邀请你了  只是请贴寄丢了
<2-18,Ross>Maybe you are invited and the invitation got lost in the mail.

60
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:05,450
<2-19,Monica>你可以打电话告诉她  我们小时候
<2-19,Monica>You call her and tell her that when we were kids...

61
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:08,960
<2-19,Monica>她的宝贝芬妮好几次想脱光我的衣服
<2-19,Monica>...her precious Frannie tried to undress me several times.

62
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,800
<2-19,Monica>要不是我阻止了她  她也结不了婚
<2-19,Monica>If I hadrt stopped her, there wouldn't be a wedding to go to.

63
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,770
<2-20,Ross>她也想脱我的衣服
<2-20,Ross>She tried to undress me too.

64
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:19,070
<2-21,Chandler>我以前会帮葛兰表弟脱衣服
<2-21,Chandler>I used to undress my cousin Glenn.

65
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:30,340
<3-1,Phoebe>乔瑟夫·弗朗西斯·崔比安尼  你回家了吗
<3-1,Phoebe>Joseph Francis Tribbiani, are you home yet?

66
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,680
<3-2,Rachel>我想他还没有回家  怎么了
<3-2,Rachel>I think he's still out. What's wrong?

67
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:35,290
<3-3,Phoebe>我告诉你  瑞秋·凯伦·格林
<3-3,Phoebe>I'll tell you, Rachel Karen Greene.

<3-3,Phoebe>我跟乔伊有约  他留了这张字条给我
<3-3,Phoebe>I had plans with Joey, and he left me this note.

69
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,230
<3-4,Rachel>"菲比  去不了了  有约会  再聊"
<3-4,Rachel>"Pheebs, can't make it. Got a date. Talk to you later.

70
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,100
<3-4,Rachel>"老爹"
<3-4,Rachel>Big Daddy."

71
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,890
<3-5,Phoebe>-"老爹"  -最近我们在试这个昵称
<3-5,Phoebe>- "Big Daddy"? - That's a nickname we were trying out.

72
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:50,340
<3-6,Ross>你知道永不会重复的昵称是什么吗
<3-6,Ross>You know what nickname never caught on?

73
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,800
<3-6,Ross>"罗斯原子人"
<3-6,Ross>"The Ross-a-tron."

74
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,270
<3-8,Phoebe>约瑟夫·弗兰斯西回来了
<3-8,Phoebe>Here's Joseph Francis!

75
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:01,850
<3-9,Joey>你叫我中间名做什么
<3-9,Joey>Wait, what are you middle-naming me for?

76
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,510
<3-9,Joey>我留条了
<3-9,Joey>I left you a note.

77
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:06,270
<3-10,Phoebe>那不是放我鸽子的好理由
<3-10,Phoebe>That doesn't give you the right to ditch me!

78
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:07,220
<3-11,Joey>如果你有机会打炮
<3-11,Joey>You can cancel plans

79
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:10,150
<3-11,Joey>当然可以取消跟朋友的约会
<3-11,Joey>with friends if there's a possibility for sex.

80
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,310
<3-12,Ross>他说的对  这是规则
<3-12,Ross>He's right. That is the rule.

81
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,840
<3-13,Phoebe>我不接受这规则
<3-13,Phoebe>I don't accept it this rule.

<3-13,Phoebe>我们约好后  我期待你会出现
<3-13,Phoebe>When we make plans, I expect you to show up.

83
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,420
<3-13,Phoebe>我不是你泡到妞前打发时间的代替品
<3-13,Phoebe>I'm not a way to kill time till you meet someone better.

84
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:23,250
<3-13,Phoebe>男女朋友来来去去
<3-13,Phoebe>Boyfriends and girlfriends will come and go,

85
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,140
<3-13,Phoebe>但朋友是一辈子的
<3-13,Phoebe>but this is for life.

86
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,590
<3-14,Joey>我很抱歉  我不知道这对你来说那么重要
<3-14,Joey>I'm so sorry. I had no idea it would bother you this much.

87
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,170
<3-15,Phoebe>是很重要
<3-15,Phoebe>Well, it does.

88
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:33,530
<3-16,Joey>我能弥补吗
<3-16,Joey>Well, can I make it up to you?

<3-16,Joey>抱歉

00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:43,020
<3-17,Phoebe>好吧  你说服了我
<3-17,Phoebe>Okay, you wore me down.

92
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:49,100
<3-18,Ross>既然你在那边  拿瓶啤酒给"罗斯原子人"
<3-18,Ross>While you're over there, how about a beer for "The Ross-a-tron"?

93
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:52,250
<3-19,Joey>"罗斯..."  那名字又回来了
<3-19,Joey>"Ross..." Is that back?

94
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,870
<4-2,Chandler>又有芝士蛋糕
<4-2,Chandler>The other cheesecake came.

95
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:02,510
<4-2,Chandler>他们又把它送到这里来
<4-2,Chandler>They delivered it here again.

96
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:06,210
<4-3,Rachel>把它送到楼下去  有什么问题
<4-3,Rachel>Just bring it downstairs. What's the problem?

97
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,400
<4-4,Chandler>我不知道该怎么说再见
<4-4,Chandler>I can't seem to say goodbye.

98
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:09,940
<4-5,Rachel>你认真的吗
<4-5,Rachel>Are you serious?

99
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:13,410
<4-5,Rachel>两天前我们吃掉一整个蛋糕  你还想再吃
<4-5,Rachel>We ate an entire cake two days ago and you want more?

100
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:16,280
<4-6,Chandler>我已经忘记它的味道了
<4-6,Chandler>Well, I've forgotten what it tastes like.

101
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,420
<4-7,Rachel>是芝士蛋糕  很好吃
<4-7,Rachel>It was cheesecake. It was fine.

102
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:23,530
<4-7,Rachel>饼干底很酥软  又香又浓
<4-7,Rachel>It had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust...

103
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:26,560
<4-7,Rachel>外加上浓郁的
<4-7,Rachel>...with a very rich...

104
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,730
<4-7,Rachel>但不油腻的轻奶油芝士
<4-7,Rachel>...yet light cream cheese filling.

105
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:35,410
<4-7,Rachel>我口水直下三千尺啊
<4-7,Rachel>Wow, my whole mouth just filled with saliva.

106
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:39,040
<4-8,Chandler>你知道吗  忘了它  我们只是饿了
<4-8,Chandler>Know what? Forget it. We're just hungry.

107
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,740
<4-8,Chandler>我们没有吃午餐  所以头昏脑胀
<4-8,Chandler>We haven't had lunch. We're just lightheaded.

108
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:45,470
<4-8,Chandler>我们去吃午餐  忘了那个芝士蛋糕吧
<4-8,Chandler>So let's go have lunch and forget about the cheesecake.

109
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,120
<4-9,Rachel>我们得把它还回去  才不会被诱惑
<4-9,Rachel>We'll drop it downstairs so we're not tempted.

110
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,960
<4-10,Chandler>想去哪吃
<4-10,Chandler>Where do you want to eat?

111
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,590
<4-11,Rachel>小妈妈面包店  伊利诺伊州芝加哥
<4-11,Rachel>Mama's Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinoise.

112
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,290
<5-1,Joey>梅尔·多米死了
<5-1,Joey>Mel Torme died.

113
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,120
<5-2,Monica>乔伊  那是一年前的报纸
<5-2,Monica>Joey, that paper's like a year old.

114
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:05,830
<5-3,Joey>那就说明山姆杂货铺的大减价也结束了
<5-3,Joey>Does that mean the Sam Goody's sale is over?

115
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:11,940
<5-6,Monica>雪儿阿姨那边有回音了
<5-6,Monica>So I finally heard back from Aunt Cheryl...

116
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,700
<5-7,Ross>很显然这不是误会
<5-7,Ross>...and apparently it wasn't a mistake.

117
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,710
<5-8,Monica>座位很有限
<5-8,Monica>There's limited seating...

118
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:21,680
<5-8,Monica>座位有限  我这么瘦小
<5-8,Monica>Limited seating? I am just one tiny person!

119
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,510
<5-9,Ross>对  但是她不知道
<5-9,Ross>Yeah, but she doesn't know that.

120
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:27,320
<5-9,Ross>她看到你
<5-9,Ross>I mean, the last time she saw you...

121
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:28,990
<5-9,Ross>你会把
<5-9,Ross>...you'd have turned one

122
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:31,620
<5-9,Ross>婚礼用的小椅子压垮
<5-9,Ross>of those little wedding chairs into kindling.

123
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:36,130
<5-10,Monica>"座位有限"  真是个烂借口
<5-10,Monica>"Limited seating." That's such a lame excuse.

124
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,900
<5-10,Monica>那不是她不邀请我的原因
<5-10,Monica>That's not the reason she's not inviting me.

125
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:41,070
<5-11,Ross>有什么大不了的呢
<5-11,Ross>What's the big deal?

126
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,970
<5-11,Ross>我没办法观礼  只能去吃喜酒
<5-11,Ross>I wasn't invited to the ceremony, just the reception.

127
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:45,110
<5-11,Ross>如果能让你好受点的话
<5-11,Ross>If it makes you feel any better,

128
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:47,610
<5-11,Ross>琼恩和我出现下
<5-11,Ross>Joan and I will just make an appearance...

129
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:51,150
<5-11,Ross>就提早离开  以示抗议好了
<5-11,Ross>...and then we'll leave early as a sign of protest.

<5-13,Ross>And despite what some people say, not broad-backed.

<12-4,Rachel>我们是甜食小贼  我们不受法律掌控
<12-4,Rachel>We're dessert stealers. We're living outside the law.

296
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,140
<12-5,Chandler>我不能让你跟芝士蛋糕独处
<12-5,Chandler>I don't trust you with this cake.

<13-3,Chandler>That's not fair. You had some.

302
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:46,620
<13-4,Rachel>我想莫妮卡一定想知道

308
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:07,310
<13-7,Chandler>或者我该量一下
<13-7,Chandler>Maybe if I measure it...
