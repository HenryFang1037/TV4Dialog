147
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:41,800
<8-3,Chandler>因为你等了这么久

<11-23,Joey>你跟她们两个都有做吧

325
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:05,920
<15-11,Rachel>婚誓对你们来说是个屁吗
<15-11,Rachel>Do wedding vows mean squat to you people?

326
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,390
<15-11,Rachel>为什么我们一说要出门  砰
<15-11,Rachel>Why is it that the second we tell you we are going out of town...

327
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:13,650
<15-11,Rachel>你们就跟邻居的遛狗小妹上床
<15-11,Rachel>...bam, there you are in bed with the neighbor's dog- walker?

00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,930
<15-13,Rachel>我说真的
<15-13,Rachel>No, seriously. Seriously.

330
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:26,030
<15-13,Rachel>婚姻的神圣性死哪儿去了
<15-13,Rachel>What has happened to the sanctity of marriage?

331
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:28,530
<15-14,Ross>你昨晚不是才在乔伊家厮混吗
<15-14,Ross>Didn't you spend last night at Joey's?

332
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:30,670
<15-15,Rachel>你是谁呀  侦探吗
<15-15,Rachel>What are you, a detective?

333
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:35,390
<15-16,Ross>我不知道你和你丈夫怎么了...
<15-16,Ross>Look, l don't know what's going on with you and your husband...

334
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:38,920
<15-16,Ross>也希望那位遛狗小妹已经成年
<15-16,Ross>...and what is hopefully an adult dog- walker.

335
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:43,990
<15-16,Ross>但我要说不是全天下的男人都那样
<15-16,Ross>Look, can l just say, not all men are like that.

336
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,490
<15-18,Ross>有些男人愿意尽全力
<15-18,Ross>There are men who'll do whatever it takes

337
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:47,850
<15-18,Ross>只希望能挽回婚姻
<15-18,Ross>to make their marriage work.

338
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:50,630
<15-18,Ross>有些男人甚至愿意退到一边
<15-18,Ross>And there are some men who will stand by and watch...

339
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:54,730
<15-18,Ross>看老婆跟健身房刚认识的女人"2P"
<15-18,Ross>as their wives engage in what can only be described as a "twosome".

340
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,060
<15-18,Ross>火热得好像旁若无人
<15-18,Ross>...with some woman she barely knows from the gym!

341
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,110
<15-19,Rachel>这些男人是谁啊
<15-19,Rachel>Who are these men?

<15-20,Ross>就是我认识的一个人
<15-20,Ross>Just men. A guy l know.

343
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:06,520
<15-21,Rachel>你可能要告诉他
<15-21,Rachel>Well, you might want to tell him

344
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,920
<15-21,Rachel>听起来他的老婆
<15-21,Rachel>it sounds like his wife...

345
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:11,000
<15-21,Rachel>是同性恋
<15-21,Rachel>...is gay.

348
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:24,430
<15-22,Ross>天啊
<15-22,Ross>Oh, my God.

349
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:28,120
<15-22,Ross>她是典型的同性恋
<15-22,Ross>She is so gay!

00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,850
<15-22,Ross>我真不敢相信

<15-23,Rachel>已婚者的"黄道吉日"啊
<15-23,Rachel>Good day for married people, huh?

<15-25,Rachel>很遗憾你老婆是同性恋
<15-25,Rachel>l'm sorry your wife is gay.

354
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,910
<15-25,Rachel>看来女人也没那么好
<15-25,Rachel>l guess women aren't that great either, uh?

<15-26,Ross>去告诉我老婆啊

361
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,300
<16-6,Monica>你为什么要这样
<16-6,Monica>Why would you do that?

362
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,540
<16-7,Chandler>因为你不该和他在一起
<16-7,Chandler>Because you shouldn't be with him.

363
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,720
<16-7,Chandler>你应该和我在一起
<16-7,Chandler>You should be with me.

<16-9,Chandler>昨晚那件事不能过了就算了
<16-9,Chandler>Look, things like last night, they don't just happen, you know.

367
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,680
<16-9,Chandler>至少对我意义重大
<16-9,Chandler>At least not to me.

368
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,790
<16-9,Chandler>我跟另外两个女人在一起时
<16-9,Chandler>l mean, with the other two women...
