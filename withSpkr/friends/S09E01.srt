<3-11,Phoebe>那些亚美尼亚人都不看电视  反而在看你
<3-11,Phoebe>That Armenian family was watching you instead of the TV.

69
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,720
<3-11,Phoebe>这倒提醒了我

<3-14,Joey>兄弟  我刚做了一件很恶劣的事

73
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:58,380
<3-15,Chandler>是你放的屁吗  我以为是杰克
<3-15,Chandler>That was you? I thought it was Jack.

00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:00,890
<3-16,Joey>不  那确实是杰克放的
<3-16,Joey>No,no. That was Jack.

<3-16,Joey>瑞秋以为我向她求婚
<3-16,Joey>Rachel thinks I asked her to marry me.

76
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:04,880
<3-17,Chandler>什么  她为什么会那样以为呢
<3-17,Chandler>What? Why does she think that?

77
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,940
<3-18,Joey>因为当时看着确实像那么回事儿
<3-18,Joey>Because it kind of looked like I did.

78
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:10,170
<3-19,Chandler>再问一次  什么
<3-19,Chandler>Again,what?

79
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,560
<3-20,Joey>好啦  我当时单膝跪在地上
<3-20,Joey>Okay,I was down on one knee

80
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,520
<3-20,Joey>手中拿着戒指...
<3-20,Joey>with the ring in my hand..

81
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,640
<3-21,Chandler>是个男人都会偶尔那样练习一下的
<3-21,Chandler>As we all are at some point during the day.

82
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,910
<3-22,Joey>那不是我的戒指  是从罗斯的夹克掉出来的
<3-22,Joey>It wasn't my ring. It fell out of Ross' jacket..

83
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,480
<3-22,Joey>当我蹲下去要把它捡起来时
<3-22,Joey>and when I knelt down to pick it up,

84
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,120
<3-22,Joey>瑞秋以为我是在求婚
<3-22,Joey>Rachel thought I was proposing.

85
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,550
<3-23,Chandler>罗斯准备了戒指  他要求婚吗
<3-23,Chandler>Ross had a ring? And he was gonna propose?

86
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:28,680
<3-24,Joey>-我想是吧  -而你抢在他之前先做了
<3-24,Joey>- I guess. - And you did it first?

87
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:29,880
<3-25,Chandler>他会痛不欲生的
<3-25,Chandler>This is gonna kill him.

88
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:32,730
<3-25,Chandler>你知道他有多爱向人求婚
<3-25,Chandler>You know how much he loves to propose.

89
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,060
<3-26,Joey>我知道  我知道  真是太糟糕了
<3-26,Joey>I know. I know. It's awful.

90
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,850
<3-27,Chandler>那她说了些什么
<3-27,Chandler>Well,what did she say?

91
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,650
<3-28,Joey>她说"我愿意"
<3-28,Joey>She said,"Yes."

92
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:42,420
<3-29,Chandler>罗斯知道吗
<3-29,Chandler>Does Ross know?

93
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,780
<3-30,Joey>我的天啊 我该怎么告诉他呢
<3-30,Joey>Oh,my God. What the hell am I gonna tell him?

94
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,080
<3-31,Chandler>或许你根本什么都不用告诉他
<3-31,Chandler>Maybe you don't have to tell him anything.

95
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,000
<3-32,Joey>我喜欢  甚合我意
<3-32,Joey>I like that. Yeah.

96
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,050
<3-33,Chandler>如果你先去跟瑞秋解释清楚
<3-33,Chandler>If you clear things up with Rachel,

97
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:52,550
<3-33,Chandler>罗斯就永远不需要知道了
<3-33,Chandler>Ross never needs to find out.

98
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:53,360
<3-33,Chandler>但你必须赶快行动
<3-33,Chandler>But you have to do it now

99
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,370
<3-33,Chandler>别等他发现  然后痛扁你
<3-33,Chandler>before he hears about it and kicks your ass.

100
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:57,720
<3-34,Joey>好吧  我们别扯得太远

00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:03,650
<4-16,Phoebe>他走了  你的未婚夫
<4-16,Phoebe>There he goes. Your fiance.

134
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:07,110
<4-17,Rachel>我想是吧
<4-17,Rachel>I guess so.

135
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,380
<4-18,Phoebe>不过他会在睡着的时候自摸
<4-18,Phoebe>Although he does play with himself in his sleep.

136
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,650
<4-19,Rachel>我一点也不惊讶
<4-19,Rachel>I can't say I'm surprised.

137
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,900
<5-1,Ross>爸  你在做什么
<5-1,Ross>Dad,what are you doing?

138
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,920
<5-2,Mr. Geller>有两个人在里面做爱
<5-2,Mr. Geller>There are people in there having sex.

139
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,850
<5-3,Joey>不可能是我  我人站在这里
<5-3,Joey>It can't be me. I'm standing right here.

140
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,170
<5-4,Mr. Geller>-想要偷看吗  -不要
<5-4,Mr. Geller>- Wanna peek? - No!

141
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:30,760
<5-6,Mr. Geller>别这样
<5-6,Mr. Geller>Come on.

142
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,230
<5-7,Ross>你知道吗  我讨厌妈不在你身边的时候
<5-7,Ross>You know what? I don't like you without Mom.

143
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,080
<5-6,Mr. Geller>走吧
<5-6,Mr. Geller>Come on.

144
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:39,130
<5-8,Joey>我们不偷看吗
<5-8,Joey>We're not peeking?

145
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:43,430
<5-9,Mr. Geller>我还是要偷看
<5-9,Mr. Geller>Well,I'm peeking.

146
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,780
<5-9,Mr. Geller>我的天啊
<5-9,Mr. Geller>Oh,my God!

147
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:51,220
<5-10,Chandler>你好先生  你认识莫妮卡的
<5-10,Chandler>Hello,sir. You know Monica.

148
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,340
<6-1,Joey>-嘿  可以进来吗  -当然可以
<6-1,Joey>- Hey,is it okay to come in? - Of course.

149
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:12,530
<6-2,Rachel>乔伊  瞧这戒指  我...
<6-2,Rachel>Joey,this ring, I..

150
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:15,220
<6-2,Rachel>真是太美了  我好喜欢
<6-2,Rachel>It's beautiful. I love it.

151
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,150
<6-3,Joey>是啊  听着  瑞秋
<6-3,Joey>Yeah. Look, Rach,

152
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:19,500
<6-3,Joey>有件事我必须要告诉你
<6-3,Joey>there's something I gotta tell you.

153
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,040
<6-5,Nurse>你准备好要再试喂母乳了吗
<6-5,Nurse>Are you ready to try nursing again?

154
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,750
<6-6,Rachel>是啊  嗨  艾玛
<6-6,Rachel>Yeah. Hi,Emma.

155
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,120
<6-6,Rachel>你觉得她为什么不吸我的奶呢
<6-6,Rachel>Why do you think she won't take my breast?

156
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,650
<6-7,Nurse>没关系的  婴儿需要一点时间适应
<6-7,Nurse>It's all right. It takes babies a while to get it.

157
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:33,570
<6-7,Nurse>-不过别担心  她会吸的  -好吧
<6-7,Nurse>- But don't worry,it'll happen. - Okay.

158
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:38,920
<6-9,Rachel>来吧  亲爱的  你可以办得到的
<6-9,Rachel>Okay,sweetie,you can do it.

159
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,470
<6-9,Rachel>张开嘴巴  然后把它放到嘴里
<6-9,Rachel>Just open up and put it in your mouth.

160
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:43,360
<6-10,Joey>救命啊  上帝
<6-10,Joey>Dear Lord.

161
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:48,080
<6-11,Rachel>我很抱歉  亲爱的  你刚想说什么
<6-11,Rachel>I'm sorry,honey,what were you saying?

162
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:49,750
<6-12,Joey>噢  对  听着  我想...
<6-12,Joey>Yeah,look,I think that..

163
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,580
<6-13,Rachel>瞧  她又转开了
<6-13,Rachel>Look! She's pulling away again.

164
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:55,720
<6-13,Rachel>会不会是我的乳头对她而言太大了呢
<6-13,Rachel>Do you think my nipples are too big for her mouth?

165
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:00,960
<6-13,Rachel>她像是被吓到了
<6-13,Rachel>She looks scared.

166
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,130
<6-13,Rachel>她看起来是不是像被吓到了呢
<6-13,Rachel>Doesn't she look scared?

167
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:04,480
<6-14,Joey>你知道的  我跟她又不是很熟
<6-14,Joey>You know,I don't really know her.

168
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:08,630
<6-15,Nurse>我们试试看按摩胸部来刺激乳汁分泌
<6-15,Nurse>Why don't we try massaging the breast to stimulate the flow?

169
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:11,190
<6-16,Joey>-好的  -你在玩我吗
<6-16,Joey>- Okay. - Are you kidding me?

170
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:14,220
<6-16,Joey>真是好沮丧
<6-16,Joey>This is so frustrating.

171
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,100
<6-17,Rachel>她为什么不喜欢我的乳房呢
<6-17,Rachel>Why doesn't she want my breast?

172
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,600
<6-18,Joey>我不知道  或许她发疯了
<6-18,Joey>I don't know! Maybe she's crazy!

173
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:24,350
<7-1,Phoebe>-嘿  等一下 -嗨
<7-1,Phoebe>- Hey,wait up. - Hi.

174
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,190
<7-3,Phoebe>恭喜了
<7-3,Phoebe>Congratulations.

175
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,870
<7-3,Phoebe>我不想在乔伊面前说出来
<7-3,Phoebe>I didn't want to say anything in front of Joey.

176
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,350
<7-3,Phoebe>因为我不清楚他是否已经知道
<7-3,Phoebe>I didn't know if he knew.

177
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:30,720
<7-4,Ross>知道什么  我们有了个孩子吗
<7-4,Ross>What? That we had a baby?

178
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:32,970
<7-4,Ross>我们别太低估他的消息灵通度了
<7-4,Ross>Now let's give him a little credit.

179
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:37,020
<7-4,Ross>虽然他之前才吃了一个塑料水果
<7-4,Ross>Although he did eat a piece of plastic fruit earlier.

180
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:40,180
<7-5,Phoebe>不  我是说你跟瑞秋订婚的事
<7-5,Phoebe>No,no,that you and Rachel are engaged.

181
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,720
<7-6,Ross>-什么  -噢  那是秘密吗
<7-6,Ross>- What? - Oh,it's a secret?

182
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:48,310
<7-7,Phoebe>太棒了  我们很久都没有玩秘密游戏了
<7-7,Phoebe>Goody. Yes! We haven't done the secret thing in a long time.

183
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,600
<7-8,Ross>菲比  没有什么秘密  好吗
<7-8,Ross>Phoebe,there is no secret,okay?

184
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,400
<7-8,Ross>我都没有求婚
<7-8,Ross>I didn't propose.

185
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:53,590
<7-9,Phoebe>你在说谎吗
<7-9,Phoebe>Are you lying?

186
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:54,480
<7-9,Phoebe>是不是又跟上次一样
<7-9,Phoebe>Is this like that time

187
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,180
<7-9,Phoebe>你要骗我们你是医生[博士]
<7-9,Phoebe>you tried to convince us you were a doctor?

188
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:04,390
<7-10,Ross>我的确是博士
<7-10,Ross>I am a doctor!

189
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:09,130
<7-10,Ross>算了  我要自己去跟瑞秋谈
<7-10,Ross>You know what? I'm just gonna go and talk to Rachel myself.

190
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,060
<7-11,Phoebe>好吧  我也去
<7-11,Phoebe>All right. Well,me too.

191
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,020
<7-11,Phoebe>要不要叫醒她
<7-11,Phoebe>Well,should we wake her up?

192
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:17,140
<7-12,Ross>不  别这样  让她睡
<7-12,Ross>No. No. Come on,let her sleep.

193
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:21,150
<7-13,Phoebe>-她真的是累坏了  -而且真的是订婚了
<7-13,Phoebe>- She's so exhausted. - And so engaged.

194
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:36,810
<7-14,Ross>我的天  她以为我们订婚了
<7-14,Ross>Oh,my God. She thinks we're engaged!

195
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:40,290
<7-14,Ross>为什么  她为什么认为我们订婚了呢
<7-14,Ross>Why? Why,why would she think we're engaged?

196
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:43,620
<7-15,Phoebe>或许是因为你给了她订婚戒指吗
<7-15,Phoebe>Perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring?

197
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,890
<7-15,Phoebe>话说  罗斯  博士应该要是很聪明的
<7-15,Phoebe>You know,Ross,doctors are supposed to be smart.

198
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:50,150
<7-16,Ross>-我没有给她那个戒指  -你没有吗
<7-16,Ross>- I didn't give her that ring. - You didn't?

199
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,960
<7-19,Phoebe>-没有   -那是谁的戒指呢
<7-19,Phoebe>- No! - So whose ring is it?

200
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,600
<7-20,Ross>是我的
<7-20,Ross>It's mine.

201
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:58,090
<7-21,Phoebe>-那是订婚戒指吗  -是啊
<7-21,Phoebe>- Is it an engagement ring? - Yes.

202
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,000
<7-23,Phoebe>-但是你并没有拿给她  -没有
<7-23,Phoebe>- But you didn't give it to her? - No.

203
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,640
<7-24,Ross>-但你本来是要求婚的  -不是
<7-24,Ross>- But you were going to propose? - No!

204
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:05,500
<7-26,Ross>我可能对这件事没兴趣了
<7-26,Ross>I might be losing interest in this.

205
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:10,170
<7-28,Ross>听着  我妈给我那个戒指...
<7-28,Ross>Look. Look,my mom gave me that ring..

206
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:12,470
<7-28,Ross>是因为她要我跟瑞秋求婚
<7-28,Ross>because she wanted me to propose to Rachel.

207
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:14,260
<7-28,Ross>但是我只想要知道...
<7-28,Ross>But all I wanted to do was see..

208
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:18,810
<7-28,Ross>她是否愿意再重新开始
<7-28,Ross>if she maybe,kind of wanted to start things up again.

209
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:21,810
<7-29,Phoebe>不温不火的恋爱感觉真美好
<7-29,Phoebe>What beautiful lukewarm sentiment.

210
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,230
<7-29,Phoebe>听着  我不想要冲动行事
<7-29,Phoebe>Look. I didn't want to rush into anything.

211
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:26,040
<7-30,Ross>似乎她也不想要那样
<7-30,Ross>It seemed like she didn't want to either.

212
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,140
<7-30,Ross>但我不明白怎么会变成现在的状况
<7-30,Ross>But I don't understand how any of this happened.

213
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,820
<7-30,Ross>难道是她在我的夹克里找到戒指
<7-30,Ross>What,did she find the ring in my jacket,

214
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,480
<7-30,Ross>然后就认为我要求婚
<7-30,Ross>assume I was gonna propose..

215
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:36,650
<7-30,Ross>便急着戴上戒指  向大家宣布吗
<7-30,Ross>throw it on and just start telling people?

216
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,900
<7-31,Phoebe>不  她说你有向她求婚
<7-31,Phoebe>No,no. She said you actually proposed to her.

217
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:43,970
<7-31,Phoebe>我没有  我没有求婚
<7-31,Phoebe>Well,I didn't! I didn't propose!

218
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,270
<7-32,Ross>除非...
<7-32,Ross>Unless..

219
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,010
<7-32,Ross>我有吗
<7-32,Ross>Did I?

220
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:59,030
<7-32,Ross>我已经40个小时没睡觉...
<7-32,Ross>I haven't slept in 40 hours and..

221
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:05,480
<7-32,Ross>那听起来的确像是我会做的事
<7-32,Ross>It does sound like something I would do.

222
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,490
<8-1,Chandler>听着  我们不能永远躲在这里
<8-1,Chandler>Look,we can't stay in here forever.

223
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,280
<8-2,Monica>我只是不敢相信我爸看到我们在做爱
<8-2,Monica>It's just,I still can't believe that my dad saw us having sex.

224
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,230
<8-2,Monica>我的钢琴独奏会他都一次没去过
<8-2,Monica>He didn't make it to one of my piano recitals,

225
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,070
<8-2,Monica>但他却看到这个
<8-2,Monica>but this he sees!

226
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:29,160
<8-3,Chandler>没关系的  我们都是大人了
<8-3,Chandler>This is okay. We're all adults here.

227
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,120
<8-3,Chandler>没有什么好丢人的
<8-3,Chandler>There's nothing to be ashamed of.

228
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,750
<8-3,Chandler>现在  我们把内裤放到口袋里
<8-3,Chandler>Now,let's put our underwear in our pockets

229
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,650
<8-3,Chandler>然后大胆走出去
<8-3,Chandler>and walk out the door.

230
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,520
<8-4,Monica>嗨  爸
<8-4,Monica>Hi,Dad.

231
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,860
<8-4,Monica>我还是可以叫你爸  对吧
<8-4,Monica>I can still call you that,right?

232
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:49,070
<8-5,Mr. Geller>当然  我永远都是你爸
<8-5,Mr. Geller>Of course. I'll always be your dad.

233
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,150
<8-6,Chandler>我只想让你知道
<8-6,Chandler>I just want you to know that

234
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:54,600
<8-6,Chandler>你刚刚目击的行为  并非是为了爽而已
<8-6,Chandler>what you witnessed in there,that wasn't for fun.

235
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:59,600
<8-8,Chandler>-不爽吗  -为什么  为什么你...
<8-8,Chandler>- It wasn't fun? - Why,why,why would you..?

236
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:02,810
<8-8,Chandler>我只是不想让你认为
<8-8,Chandler>Look,I just don't want you to think..

237
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:05,610
<8-8,Chandler>我们像动物一样  随地交配撒欢
<8-8,Chandler>that we're animals who do it whenever we want.

238
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:07,400
<8-8,Chandler>我没那样想
<8-8,Chandler>Well,I don't think that.

239
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,990
<8-9,Mr. Geller>在今天之前  我从未想过你们会做爱
<8-9,Mr. Geller>Before today,I never thought of you two having sex at all.

240
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:13,700
<8-9,Mr. Geller>之前的想法要单纯的多
<8-9,Mr. Geller>It was a simpler time.

241
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:18,290
<8-10,Monica>事实是  爸  我们正在努力
<8-10,Monica>The truth is,Dad,we're trying.

242
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:21,040
<8-12,Monica>-什么  -是啊  我们正在努力弄大肚子
<8-12,Monica>- What? - Yeah,we're trying to get pregnant.

243
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,340
<8-13,Mr. Geller>我的天啊  真是太好了
<8-13,Mr. Geller>Oh,my God,this is so exciting.

244
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:26,100
<8-13,Mr. Geller>快进去继续"努力"  我来看门
<8-13,Mr. Geller>Well,get back in there! I'll guard the door!

245
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:28,850
<8-14,Monica>没关系  爸  我们可以等会儿再说
<8-14,Monica>That's okay,Dad,we can wait until later.

246
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,630
<8-15,Mr. Geller>我可不同意 你不是正在排卵吗
<8-15,Mr. Geller>I don't think so. Aren't you ovulating?

247
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:33,210
<8-16,Monica>爸
<8-16,Monica>Daddy!

248
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:35,400
<8-17,Mr. Geller>你要把握时机  小公主
<8-17,Mr. Geller>You gotta get at it,princess.

249
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,620
<8-17,Mr. Geller>当年你妈跟我试着要怀你的时候
<8-17,Mr. Geller>When your mother and I were trying to conceive you..

250
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:40,390
<8-17,Mr. Geller>只要她在排卵  我们就做
<8-17,Mr. Geller>whenever she was ovulating,bam,we did it!

251
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:42,620
<8-17,Mr. Geller>所以我现在臀部都落下了病根
<8-17,Mr. Geller>That's how I got my bad hip.

252
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,450
<8-18,Chandler>真好笑   你们的对话简直
<8-18,Chandler>That's funny. This conversation's

253
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:46,900
<8-18,Chandler>让我的脑袋像被子弹打穿一样
<8-18,Chandler>how I got the bullet hole in my head.

254
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:49,670
<8-19,Mr. Geller>有一次我把膝盖架到洗手台上
<8-19,Mr. Geller>This one time I had my knee on the sink,

255
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:51,000
<8-19,Mr. Geller>而你妈...
<8-19,Mr. Geller>and your mother, she was..

256
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,850
<8-20,Monica>我想我们不需要知道
<8-20,Monica>I don't think we need to hear

257
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:55,000
<8-20,Monica>你跟我妈的特殊体位
<8-20,Monica>the specific positions you and Mom had.

258
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,800
<8-21,Mr. Geller>没错  现在的问题是你们的体位
<8-21,Mr. Geller>You're right. This is about your positions.

259
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,370
<8-21,Mr. Geller>我刚看到你们在更衣室里
<8-21,Mr. Geller>Now,what I saw in the closet

260
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:04,260
<8-21,Mr. Geller>采用的并非是最佳受孕体位
<8-21,Mr. Geller>is not the optimum position..for conceiving a child.

261
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,920
<8-21,Mr. Geller>虽然那感觉可能会很爽
<8-21,Mr. Geller>Although it might feel good.

262
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,870
<8-22,Monica>我现在感觉非常不爽
<8-22,Monica>I don't feel good right now.

263
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,090
<8-23,Mr. Geller>但是快感是很重要的
<8-23,Mr. Geller>But pleasure is important,

264
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:12,880
<8-23,Mr. Geller>而且如果女人达到高潮  受孕会更容易
<8-23,Mr. Geller>and it helps if the woman has an orgasm.

265
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:16,280
<8-23,Mr. Geller>你能完成任务吗  猛男
<8-23,Mr. Geller>You up to the task,sailor?

266
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:28,470
<9-2,Rachel>我需要告诉你一件事
<9-2,Rachel>Oh,I need to tell you something.

267
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:29,990
<9-3,Monica>现在正是时候
<9-3,Monica>Well,now's a good time.

268
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:32,400
<9-3,Monica>我正要去把我的耳朵切掉
<9-3,Monica>I'm on my way to have my ears cut off.

269
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,530
<9-4,Rachel>乔伊要我嫁给他
<9-4,Rachel>Joey asked me to marry him.

<9-9,Monica>It's so inappropriate. No,it is worse than that.

276
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,830
<9-9,Monica>简直是有违道德  简直
<9-9,Monica>It is wrong. It's...

277
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:53,310
<9-9,Monica>钻戒比我的大多了
<9-9,Monica>It is bigger than mine!

<10-1,Chandler>你还没告诉瑞秋你当时不是在求婚吗
<10-1,Chandler>You still haven't told Rachel you weren't proposing?

344
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:29,110
<11-31,Joey>然后你就以为我是在求婚
<11-31,Joey>and you thought I was proposing.

345
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:33,700
<11-32,Rachel>但是你嘴里说着"嫁给我好吗"

<11-36,Rachel>你为什么不早点说呢
<11-36,Rachel>Why didn't you tell me that before?

350
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,460
<11-37,Joey>我也想啊  但是一直有人进来打断
<11-37,Joey>Well,I tried.. but people kept coming in,

351
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:52,020
<11-37,Joey>然后你又露出胸部
<11-37,Joey>and then you took your breast out.

352
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:57,410
<11-38,Ross>你看到她的胸部了
<11-38,Ross>You saw her breast?

353
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:01,140
<11-39,Joey>我待会再告诉你  冷静点
<11-39,Joey>I'll tell you about it later. Be cool.

354
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:06,070
<11-40,Rachel>那乔伊你拿个戒指搞什么
<11-40,Rachel>Then Joey, what the hell were you doing with an engagement ring?

355
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:09,160
<11-41,Joey>那不是我的戒指  是罗斯的
<11-41,Joey>It wasn't my ring! It's Ross' ring.

356
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,300
<11-41,Joey>正因此我才觉得好内疚  瑞秋
<11-41,Joey>That's why I felt so bad, Rach,

357
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,770
<11-42,Ross>因为他本来是打算求婚的
<11-42,Ross>because he was gonna propose.

358
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:15,290
<11-42,Ross>什么
