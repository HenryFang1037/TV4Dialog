00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:06,180
<1-1,Ross>你答应要嫁给乔伊
<1-1,Ross>You said you'd marry Joey?

2
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:09,010
<1-2,Rachel>你要知道我当时可是累坏了
<1-2,Rachel>Okay,you have to realize,I was exhausted,

3
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:10,160
<1-2,Rachel>很情绪化
<1-2,Rachel>I was emotional.

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,940
<1-2,Rachel>任何人求婚  我都会答应的
<1-2,Rachel>I would have said yes to anybody.

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,990
<1-2,Rachel>就像上次你向我求婚一样
<1-2,Rachel>Like that time when you and I got married.

6
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:18,820
<1-2,Rachel>我控制不了自己
<1-2,Rachel>I'm not helping.

7
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:23,590
<1-3,Ross>你才刚生下我们的小孩  却答应要嫁给他
<1-3,Ross>So you said yes to him,and you just had our baby?

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,130
<1-4,Rachel>没错  而且按照习俗
<1-4,Rachel>That is right. And traditionally,

9
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,520
<1-4,Rachel>父亲应该要送母亲一个礼物的
<1-4,Rachel>the daddy gives the mommy a present.

10
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,420
<1-4,Rachel>但是我不打算跟你计较
<1-4,Rachel>But I am prepared to let that go.

11
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,460
<1-5,Ross>所以当我过来看看
<1-5,Ross>So when I came here to see

12
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,660
<1-5,Ross>你是否愿意重新来过
<1-5,Ross>if you wanted to maybe start things up again..

13
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,950
<1-5,Ross>你已经跟我最好的朋友订婚了
<1-5,Ross>you were engaged to my best friend?

14
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,010
<1-5,Ross>是吗
<1-5,Ross>Really?

15
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,810
<1-6,Rachel>我以为钱德勒才是你最好的朋友
<1-6,Rachel>I thought Chandler was your best friend.

16
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:47,010
<1-7,Ross>钱德勒是我的老朋友

00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:56,190
<1-10,Ross>瑞秋答应要嫁给你
<1-10,Ross>Rachel said she'd marry you?

20
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:59,600
<1-11,Joey>我走错房间了  不好意思

38
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,830
<2-1,Monica>所以我要说你挑的标语大部分都是很棒的
<2-1,Monica>So I'll say most of the signs you bought are good.

39
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,290
<2-2,Phoebe>不  "恭喜生女儿"的标语卖完了
<2-2,Phoebe>No,they ran out of "It's a Girl!"

40
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,950
<2-2,Phoebe>但是我可以处理一下的

00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:42,220
<2-8,Chandler>今天的大型部门会议

54
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,460
<2-8,Chandler>我越是担心  越是没有办法入睡
<2-8,Chandler>The more I worried,the more I couldn't sleep.

55
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,710
<2-8,Chandler>你知道的  我会想
<2-8,Chandler>You know,and then I was,like,

<2-8,Chandler>无论我怎么试  就是睡不着
<2-8,Chandler>No matter what I did,I couldn't fall asleep.

60
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:55,300
<2-9,Joey>你知道你应该做什么吗
<2-9,Joey>You know what you should've done?

61

<2-9,Joey>对你自己讲那个小故事

<2-15,Rachel>一个挤爆整间公寓的大黑猩猩娃娃
<2-15,Rachel>A giant,stuffed gorilla that takes up the entire apartment.

68
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,110
<2-15,Rachel>真搞不懂有些人在想
<2-15,Rachel>What are people think..?

<2-16,Joey>嘿  罗斯在哪呢
<2-16,Joey>Hey,so where's Ross?

71

<2-17,Rachel>他在楼下把东西搬出计程车
<2-17,Rachel>He's downstairs getting the stuff out of the cab.

72
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:33,560
<2-18,Joey>他还在气我们两个吗
<2-18,Joey>Is he still mad at us?

73
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,570
<2-19,Rachel>气你多过气我
<2-19,Rachel>Well,you more than me.

74
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,310
<2-19,Rachel>他总不能太生我的气
<2-19,Rachel>But he can't stay too mad at me.

75
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,740
<2-19,Rachel>我才刚生下他的小孩耶
<2-19,Rachel>I mean,I just had his baby.

76
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,540
<2-20,Joey>太不公平了  我又不会生
<2-20,Joey>That's not fair. I can't do that.

77
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,410
<2-21,Rachel>我不知道他上来时 你应不应该在场
<2-21,Rachel>I'm not sure you should be here when he comes up.

78
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:44,910
<2-22,Joey>那正是我所担心的
<2-22,Joey>Say that's what I was afraid of.

79
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,010
<2-22,Joey>我也不认为我该在场
<2-22,Joey>I didn't think I should be here either.

80
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:48,050
<2-22,Joey>但某人说罗斯现在该已经释怀了
<2-22,Joey>But somebody said he'd be over it.

81
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:49,010
<2-23,Chandler>嘿  我怎么会知道呢
<2-23,Chandler>Hey,what do I know?

82

<2-23,Chandler>我只想买个更大一点的黑猩猩
<2-23,Chandler>I wanted to get a bigger gorilla.

83

88
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,120
<3-2,Ms. McKenna>但是为了不让你们觉得无趣
<3-2,Ms. McKenna>But instead of boring you..

<7-8,Joey>事实上  没必要

<7-11,Ross>捡起我祖母的戒指
<7-11,Ross>picked up my grandmother's ring

186
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:39,030
<7-13,Ross>但你为什么没告诉我呢
<7-13,Ross>But why couldn't you tell me?

<8-24,Monica>我连歌舞剧《俄克拉荷马州》 都不想看
<8-24,Monica>I don't even want to see the musical Oklahoma.

256
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,410
<8-25,Chandler>不是吧  "噢  美妙的早晨"

<8-26,Monica>你是在说我们要搬去俄克拉荷马州
<8-26,Monica>Are you trying to tell me we're moving to Oklahoma

259
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,290
<8-26,Monica>还是说你是同性恋
<8-26,Monica>or that you're gay?

260
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,200
<8-26,Monica>好吧  那些都没关系
<8-26,Monica>All right,not that this matters,

261
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,980
<8-26,Monica>但至少他们有帮你大幅加薪吧
<8-26,Monica>but did they at least offer you a huge raise?

262
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:12,980
<8-27,Chandler>没有  但是他们会帮我们租一辆福克斯汽车
<8-27,Chandler>No. But they are going to lease us a Ford Focus.

<8-30,Monica>她以为是她要搬到塔尔萨
<8-30,Monica>She thought she was moving to Tulsa.

00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,030
<9-1,Chandler>请问您现在有空吗

<9-1,Chandler>我想我不能去塔尔萨了
<9-1,Chandler>I don't think I can move to Tulsa.

00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,560
<9-3,Chandler>我在今早的会议上睡着了
<9-3,Chandler>I kind of fell asleep in the meeting this morning.

271
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,070
<9-3,Chandler>所以当我说我可以搬到塔尔萨时
<9-3,Chandler>So when I said I'd move to Tulsa,

272
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:47,930
<9-3,Chandler>我根本不知道我在说什么
<9-3,Chandler>I didn't really know what I was saying.

<9-4,Ms. McKenna>你睡着了
<9-4,Ms. McKenna>You fell asleep?

274
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,510
<9-5,Chandler>但那是因为我整晚
<9-5,Chandler>But only because I was up all night

275
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,830
<9-5,Chandler>为会议担心而失眠
<9-5,Chandler>worried about this meeting.

276
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:53,410
<9-5,Chandler>是不是很好笑呢
<9-5,Chandler>Isn't that funny?

277
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,900
<9-5,Chandler>很讽刺  不好笑是吧  好吧
<9-5,Chandler>Irony. Not a fan? All right.

278
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,250
<9-5,Chandler>好吧  事情是这样的
<9-5,Chandler>See,here's the thing.

<9-5,Chandler>我回家告诉我老婆塔尔萨的事
<9-5,Chandler>I went home and told my wife about Tulsa,

280
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:05,140
<9-5,Chandler>但是她不想去
<9-5,Chandler>and she won't go.

281
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,850
<9-5,Chandler>至于我  我爱死塔尔萨了

00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,820
<10-22,Ross>我也这样想过

<10-23,Joey>别这样  罗斯  那根本没什么
<10-23,Joey>Come on,Ross,that didn't mean anything.

00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,770
<10-23,Joey>她当时刚生完孩子
<10-23,Joey>She'd just had the baby.

329
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:48,740
<10-23,Joey>很恐惧要独自承担未来的重任
<10-23,Joey>She was freaked out about doing it alone.

330
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,660
<10-23,Joey>任何人求婚  她都会答应的
<10-23,Joey>She would have said yes to anybody.

333
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,920
<10-26,Ross>所以我不想做一个随便的存在

334
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,920
<10-27,Joey>其实  现在这样也比较好
<10-27,Joey>You know what? It's better this way anyway.

335
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,850
<10-28,Ross>我不知道我在想什么
<10-28,Ross>I don't know what I was thinking,

336
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:08,140
<10-28,Ross>再回到之前的关系
<10-28,Ross>going down that road again with us.

337
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:12,360
<10-28,Ross>如果我们只是一起生养孩子的朋友
<10-28,Ross>It's just much easier if we're just friends

338
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,150
<10-28,Ross>一切要简单得多
<10-28,Ross>who have a kid.

00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:16,240
<10-30,Ross>-真的吗 -是啊

341
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:20,340
<10-32,Ross>是啊  那本来就是我们的计划
<10-32,Ross>Yes. That's what we always planned.

00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,040
<10-32,Ross>如果你有计划  就应该照计划执行
<10-32,Ross>And if you have a plan,you should stick to it.

343
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,650
<10-32,Ross>那就是计划的意义  不是吗
<10-32,Ross>That's why they call them plans. Hello?
