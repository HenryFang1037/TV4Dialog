1
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:05,440
<1-1,Monica>-嗨  -嗨
<1-1,Monica>- Hey, guys. - Hey.

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:06,860
<1-2,Rachel>-嗨  -嗨
<1-2,Rachel>- Hi. - Hey.

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,320
<1-4,Monica>我们有点事和你们谈谈
<1-4,Monica>We need to talk about something.

4
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:10,690
<1-5,Chandler>我们觉得
<1-5,Chandler>Yeah. We don't feel like

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,390
<1-5,Chandler>今年我们不能再作东感恩节晚餐了
<1-5,Chandler>we can host Thanksgiving this year.

6
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,330
<1-8,Ross>-什么... -你是在开玩笑吧
<1-8,Ross>- What... - Are you kidding?

7
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:17,380
<1-9,Chandler>连带工作  还有领养孩子的压力
<1-9,Chandler>Well, it's just with work and the stress of adoption...

8
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,370
<1-5,Chandler>我们只是觉得没有精力弄了
<1-5,Chandler>...we don't feel like we have the energy.

9
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:20,570
<1-9,Chandler>而且每年都让我们受累
<1-9,Chandler>Plus, we don't think it's fair

10
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:22,970
<1-9,Chandler>这不公平
<1-9,Chandler>that every year the burden falls on us.

11
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:25,930
<1-10,Ross>这口气不像你啊
<1-10,Ross>That doesn't sound like you.

12
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,400
<1-10,Ross>这像是莫妮卡的话
<1-10,Ross>That's Monica talking.

13
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,060
<1-11,Chandler>不  不  这是我们两个人的决定
<1-11,Chandler>No, no, we made this decision together.

14
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:36,140
<1-12,Ross>你把她放你嘴里的话  又说了一遍
<1-12,Ross>She's putting words in your mouth.

15
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:38,250
<1-13,Joey>你不应该把话放到我们口中
<1-13,Joey>Don't you put words in people's mouths.

16
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,060
<1-13,Joey>而是把火鸡放到我们口中
<1-13,Joey>You put turkey in people's mouths.

17
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:42,590
<1-14,Rachel>我真不敢相信
<1-14,Rachel>I can't believe this.

18
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,740
<1-14,Rachel>这可是艾玛的第一个感恩节
<1-14,Rachel>This is Emma's first Thanksgiving.

19
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:46,110
<1-15,Monica>才不是...
<1-15,Monica>No, it's not.

20
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,450
<1-16,Rachel>不是吗  她什么时候出生的
<1-16,Rachel>It's not? When was she born?

21
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:51,750
<1-17,Phoebe>我个人认为
<1-17,Phoebe>Well, personally,

22
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,920
<1-17,Phoebe>你们是应该休息一下子了
<1-17,Phoebe>I think it's great you're giving yourself a break.

23
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,320
<1-18,Monica>谢谢  菲比
<1-18,Monica>Thank you, Pheebs.

24
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:56,760
<1-19,Phoebe>不客气  这样倒好
<1-19,Phoebe>Sure. It's just as well.

25
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:58,380
<1-19,Phoebe>我是说  去年的晚餐也没那么好
<1-19,Phoebe>I mean, last year wasn't very good.

26
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:00,040
<1-19,Phoebe>她已江郎才尽  今年不会更好了
<1-19,Phoebe>I think she's losing her touch.

27
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,650
<1-20,Monica>什么  你大错特错了  女士
<1-20,Monica>What? You are way off, lady.

28
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,230
<1-20,Monica>是么  真的吗  是么
<1-20,Monica>Am l? Really? Am l?

29
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,150
<1-21,Phoebe>那你就再做一次感恩节大餐
<1-21,Phoebe>Well, why don't you cook Thanksgiving dinner

30
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,450
<1-21,Phoebe>证明我错了
<1-21,Phoebe>and prove me wrong.

31
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,600
<1-21,Phoebe>你好好想想
<1-21,Phoebe>Well, think about it.

32
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:13,810
<1-21,Phoebe>你这是在跟去年的你比拼
<1-21,Phoebe>You'd be trying to top what you did last year.

33
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,580
<1-21,Phoebe>你是在和...自己竞争
<1-21,Phoebe>You'd be in competition with yourself.

34
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:19,800
<1-22,Monica>大爱啊
<1-22,Monica>That's my favorite kind.

35
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:22,740
<1-22,Monica>好吧  今年我们继续
<1-22,Monica>Okay, we are doing this.

36
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:25,550
<1-23,Chandler>别让自己这么容易被左右
<1-23,Chandler>Don't let yourself get manipulated this way.

37
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,950
<1-24,Monica>不关你的事  钱德勒
<1-24,Monica>Stay out of this, Chandler.

38
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,090
<1-24,Monica>这是"我"和"我"之间的事情
<1-24,Monica>This is between me and me.

39
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:31,940
<1-25,Chandler>这件事
<1-25,Chandler>We are supposed to

40
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:33,530
<1-25,Chandler>我们应该一起决定啊
<1-25,Chandler>make these decisions together.

42
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:37,170
<1-25,Chandler>还记得我给你录的菲尔医生怎么说的么
<1-25,Chandler>Did you not watch the Dr. Phil I taped for you?

58
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,070
<2-2,Rachel>-嗨  -嗨  感恩节快乐
<2-2,Rachel>- Hey. - Hi. Happy Thanksgiving.

<2-4,Monica>You guys, I ordered some chocolate pies

61
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,400
<2-4,Monica>订了些巧克力派
<2-4,Monica>from that bakery on Bleeker.

62
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:42,450
<2-4,Monica>你们能帮我去取回来么
<2-4,Monica>Could you pick them up for me?

63
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,260
<2-5,Phoebe>你不自己作派吗
<2-5,Phoebe>You're not making the pies?

00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,760
<2-6,Monica>不  我不做巧克力派的
<2-6,Monica>I don't make chocolate pies.

65
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:46,710
<2-6,Monica>我小时候
<2-6,Monica>When I was younger,

66
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,870
<2-6,Monica>参加过一个吃派比赛
<2-6,Monica>I entered this pie-eating contest.

67
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:49,910
<2-6,Monica>吃得太多了
<2-6,Monica>I ate so many

68
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,610
<2-6,Monica>导致我一想就恶心
<2-6,Monica>that the thought of them makes me sick.

69
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,490
<2-7,Rachel>那你赢了没有
<2-7,Rachel>Did you at least win the contest?

<2-17,Phoebe>And compared to Emma,

87

91
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,600
<2-20,Rachel>难道我们只是为了一个奖杯
<2-20,Rachel>just the idea of pitting one baby against another...

92
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:42,850
<2-20,Rachel>就把孩子们比来比去
<2-20,Rachel>...l mean, you know,

93
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,890
<2-20,Rachel>决定谁更漂亮
<2-20,Rachel>and judging who's cuter just for a trophy...

94
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:45,960
<2-21,Rachel>还有一千块奖金
<2-21,Rachel>And a thousand dollars.

<2-22,Rachel>对了  千万别告诉罗斯
<2-22,Rachel>Oh, please, do not tell Ross.

97
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:53,650
<2-22,Rachel>他还是相信
<2-22,Rachel>He still believes that

98
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,460
<2-22,Rachel>内在的东西才重要
<2-22,Rachel>what's on the inside is important.

<3-17,Monica>You start by washing these.

138
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,240
<3-17,Monica>别用洗涤剂
<3-17,Monica>Not with soap!

139
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,980
<3-18,Chandler>你肯定没吃过我沐浴液洗过的土豆
<3-18,Chandler>You obviously haven't tasted my Palmolive potatoes.

140
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:47,930
<3-19,Ross>嘿  猜猜乔伊拿到了什么
<3-19,Ross>Hi. Hey, guess what Joey has.

141
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,960
<3-20,Joey>三张今天纽约流浪者的票
<3-20,Joey>Three tickets to today's Rangers game!

142
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:51,930
<3-21,Ross>兄弟  我是让他猜的
<3-21,Ross>Dude, I wanted him to guess.

143
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,940
<3-23,Chandler>哦  天哪
<3-23,Chandler>Oh, my God.

144
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:55,680
<3-24,Joey>是啊  而且都是好座位哦
<3-24,Joey>Yeah, they're great seats too.

145
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:56,520
<3-25,Ross>猜猜什么位置
<3-25,Ross>Guess where they are.

146
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:57,420
<3-26,Joey>正中间
<3-26,Joey>Center ice.

147
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,700
<3-27,Ross>我是不是和你有什么过节
<3-27,Ross>Did I do something to you?

148
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:05,450
<3-28,Chandler>比赛一点开始
<3-28,Chandler>The game's at 1.

149
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:06,140
<3-29,Ross>怎样
<3-29,Ross>So?

150
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,920
<3-30,Chandler>晚饭四点开始  我们赶不回来的
<3-30,Chandler>Dinner's at 4. We'll never make it back.

151
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:09,210
<3-31,Joey>那我们就提前退场
<3-31,Joey>So we'll leave before it's over.

152
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,030
<3-31,Joey>我们会准时回来的
<3-31,Joey>We'll be back in time.

153
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:10,880
<3-31,Joey>你现在这么说
<3-31,Joey>You said that now.

154
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:13,140
<3-32,Chandler>可是到时候必定要花很多时间回来的
<3-32,Chandler>But it could take us a long time to get back home.

155
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,480
<3-32,Chandler>另外乔伊可能会迷路
<3-32,Chandler>Plus, Joey could get lost

156
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:16,800
<3-32,Chandler>他们还得喊我们把他领会来
<3-32,Chandler>and they could have to page us to go pick him up.

157
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,570
<3-33,Joey>老兄  事不过三
<3-33,Joey>Dude, two times that happened!

158
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,670
<3-34,Chandler>莫妮卡为了做晚饭忙了一整天
<3-34,Chandler>Look, Monica's been working hard all day.

159
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,550
<3-34,Chandler>她一开始的时候是不想做的
<3-34,Chandler>She didn't want to host in the first place.

160
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,630
<3-34,Chandler>我们不该去的
<3-34,Chandler>We shouldn't go.

161
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:29,130
<3-35,Ross>他说得没错儿
<3-35,Ross>He's right, man.

162
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,450
<3-36,Joey>好吧  那么四点钟见
<3-36,Joey>Yeah, I guess. So we'll see you at 4.

163
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,070
<3-36,Joey>嗯
<3-36,Joey>Okay.

164
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,210
<3-37,Chandler>准备好品尝
<3-37,Chandler>And get ready to taste

165
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,080
<3-37,Chandler>我的特制酸梅酱哦
<3-37,Chandler>my very special cranberries.

166
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:38,630
<3-37,Chandler>或者  应该叫做"钱式酸梅"
<3-37,Chandler>Or should I say "Chan-berries"?

167
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,570
<3-38,Joey>伙计  你真够搞笑的
<3-38,Joey>That's some gentle comedy, dude.

168
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,180
<3-39,Ross>我们还是要去看比赛的  对吧
<3-39,Ross>We're still going to the game, right?

169
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:48,980
<4-1,Host>是的
<4-1,Host>Yeah.

170
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:58,520
<4-2,Phoebe>嘿
<4-2,Phoebe>Hey.

171
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:00,230
<4-3,Rachel>菲比  我想走了
<4-3,Rachel>Phoebe, listen, I think we gotta go.

172
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,810
<4-3,Rachel>这地方让我坐立不安
<4-3,Rachel>This place is freaking me out.

173
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,270
<4-3,Rachel>你看到那边那个人了么
<4-3,Rachel>I've been watching this guy over there.

174
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,930
<4-3,Rachel>我可不认为他带来的是个孩子
<4-3,Rachel>I don't think he came with a kid.

175
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:07,510
<4-4,Phoebe>但你现在不能离开啊
<4-4,Phoebe>But we can't leave now.

176
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,060
<4-4,Phoebe>有一个叫黑利的小孩
<4-4,Phoebe>There was this one baby, Haley,

177
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:09,980
<4-4,Phoebe>是夺冠的大热门
<4-4,Phoebe>who was favored to win...

178
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,130
<4-4,Phoebe>得了哮喘  不得不待在家里
<4-4,Phoebe>...she got croup, so she had to stay home.

179
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,910
<4-4,Phoebe>这次比赛才大开方便之门  家长们
<4-4,Phoebe>This competition just blew wide-open, folks.

180
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,910
<4-5,Rachel>菲比  这太奇怪了
<4-5,Rachel>Phoebe, it's just too weird.

181
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,590
<4-5,Rachel>我看见一个一岁的小孩穿连裤袜
<4-5,Rachel>I just saw a 1 -year-old with pantyhose on.

182
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,010
<4-6,Phoebe>我知道  我们准备的确实不够充分
<4-6,Phoebe>Oh, I know. We should've been more prepared.

183
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:26,680
<4-6,Phoebe>没事儿  我觉得
<4-6,Phoebe>It's okay. Now, the way I see it,

184
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:29,170
<4-6,Phoebe>咱们最有力的竞争对手是卡梅伦
<4-6,Phoebe>our real competition now is Cameron.

185
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,210
<4-6,Phoebe>天呐  她的衣服被脱掉了
<4-6,Phoebe>My God, they just took her sweater off.

187
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,390
<4-6,Phoebe>看他的手臂  你好  米其林先生
<4-6,Phoebe>Look at those arms. Hello, Michelin Man.

188
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,780
<4-6,Phoebe>菲比
<4-6,Phoebe>Phoebe, come on.

189
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,610
<4-7,Rachel>已经都三点了
<4-7,Rachel>You know what, it's already 3:00.

190
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,300
<4-7,Rachel>他们还没有评审到艾玛这一组
<4-7,Rachel>They haven't even gotten to Emma's group yet.

191
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:40,750
<4-7,Rachel>我们该走了  回去吃饭
<4-7,Rachel>We got dinner.

192
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,240
<4-8,Phoebe>但是艾玛的条件都具备了
<4-8,Phoebe>But Emma's got what it takes.

193
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,520
<4-8,Phoebe>她一定能走到最后
<4-8,Phoebe>She could go all the way!

194
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:48,360
<4-9,Rachel>菲比  冷静点
<4-9,Rachel>Phoebe, you have to calm down.

195
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:49,780
<4-9,Rachel>好吧
<4-9,Rachel>Okay.

196
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,460
<4-10,Phoebe>瑞秋  三州交界地区
<4-10,Phoebe>Rachel, the hottest babies in the tri-state area

00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:55,840
<4-10,Phoebe>最漂亮的宝贝们都在这里了
<4-10,Phoebe>are in this room right now.

198
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:59,240
<4-10,Phoebe>而我听见一个评审说
<4-10,Phoebe>I overheard a judge say

199
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:01,280
<4-10,Phoebe>没人比得过艾玛
<4-10,Phoebe>that not one of them holds a candle to Emma.

200
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:03,050
<4-11,Rachel>-真的么  -没错
<4-11,Rachel>- Really? - Yeah.

201
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,720
<4-12,Phoebe>你听见他们这么说
<4-12,Phoebe>You heard him say that?

202
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:05,510
<4-14,Phoebe>对
<4-14,Phoebe>Yeah.

203
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:08,100
<4-15,Rachel>好吧  那就让我们
<4-15,Rachel>All right. Okay. All right,

204
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:10,320
<4-15,Rachel>给其他的孩子们一点悲惨的回忆
<4-15,Rachel>let's give these babies something to cry about.

205
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:13,000
<4-16,Phoebe>太好了  开工吧
<4-16,Phoebe>Good. Let's get down to business.

206
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:14,230
<4-16,Phoebe>艾玛需要化妆
<4-16,Phoebe>Emma needs some makeup.

207
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,360
<4-17,Rachel>什么
<4-17,Rachel>What?

208
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:18,070
<4-18,Phoebe>不化妆跟其它孩子比起来会逊色三分的
<4-18,Phoebe>She's gonna look washed-out next to the others.

209
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,520
<4-19,Rachel>菲比  我不会让你给我的孩子化妆的
<4-19,Rachel>No, Phoebe, I'm not letting you put makeup on my baby.

210
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:21,290
<4-20,Phoebe>为什么不
<4-20,Phoebe>Why not?

211
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,710
<4-21,Rachel>因为我已经给她化过了
<4-21,Rachel>Because I already did.

212
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:33,780
<5-1,Joey>太逊了  快下场吧  你个白痴
<5-1,Joey>You suck! Get off the ice, you idiot!

213
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:37,010
<5-2,Ross>-太精彩了  -没错  耶
<5-2,Ross>- What a game. - I know. Yeah.

214
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:39,500
<5-4,Ross>钱德勒错过了这场比赛真遗憾啊
<5-4,Ross>I can't believe Chandler's missing this.

215
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:40,870
<5-5,Joey>我也替他觉得遗憾
<5-5,Joey>I'm sorry he's not here.

216
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:41,810
<5-5,Joey>但我不得不说
<5-5,Joey>But I gotta say,

217
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,250
<5-5,Joey>我真的很喜欢这个"玉米片"座
<5-5,Joey>I am really enjoying nacho chair.

218
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:46,940
<5-6,Ross>嗯  要是你不总是把我的手打开
<5-6,Ross>Yeah, I'd probably enjoy it more

219
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,900
<5-6,Ross>我也许会更喜欢些
<5-6,Ross>if you didn't keep batting my hand away.

220
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,080
<5-7,Joey>这位置太棒了
<5-7,Joey>These seats are great.

221
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:54,080
<5-7,Joey>是啊  没错
<5-7,Joey>I know, I know.

222
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:56,360
<5-8,Ross>上次在这看假期冰上节目
<5-8,Ross>When I was here for "Holidays on lce" ...

223
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,350
<5-8,Ross>座位太远了
<5-8,Ross>...l was sitting so far away,

224
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,770
<5-8,Ross>关颖珊根本就看不到我举的条幅
<5-8,Ross>Michelle Kwan couldn't read my banner.

226
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,310
<5-9,Joey>我们该走了啦
<5-9,Joey>We'd better get going.

227
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:05,740
<5-9,Joey>现在不走  回去吃饭就晚了
<5-9,Joey>If we don't leave now, we're gonna be late.

228
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,390
<5-10,Ross>可比赛太精彩了
<5-10,Ross>But it's a tie game.

229
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,770
<5-10,Ross>回去晚点应该可以吧
<5-10,Ross>So we're a little late.

230
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,190
<5-10,Ross>女生们会在那的
<5-10,Ross>The girls will be there.

231
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,320
<5-10,Ross>再进一个球再走啦
<5-10,Ross>Let's just stay for one more goal.

232
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:13,990
<5-12,Ross>-不好吧  -再有人打一架
<5-12,Ross>- I don't know. - One more fight.

233
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,250
<5-12,Ross>-好吧  -好吧
<5-12,Ross>- Okay. - Okay.

234
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,910
<6-1,Monica>大家都哪里去了
<6-1,Monica>Where is everybody?

00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,120
<6-1,Monica>他们迟到了45分钟
<6-1,Monica>They're 45 minutes late.

236
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,800
<6-2,Chandler>我真不敢相信他们还没来
<6-2,Chandler>I can't believe they're not here.

237
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:26,310
<6-2,Chandler>我那么辛苦这一天是为了什么
<6-2,Chandler>I slave and I slave for what?

238
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,550
<6-2,Chandler>他们毁了我的酸梅酱日
<6-2,Chandler>They've ruined Cranberry Day.

239
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,150
<7-2,Ross>我们迟到了多久
<7-2,Ross>How late are we?

240
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:33,990
<7-3,Joey>45分钟

<7-4,Ross>- Here. - Okay.

242
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:38,930
<7-5,Joey>瑞秋和菲比应该已经到了
<7-5,Joey>Rachel and Phoebe are already there,

243
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,180
<7-5,Joey>所以他们可能已经开始了
<7-5,Joey>so they probably started without us.

244
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:41,520
<7-5,Joey>我们溜进去
<7-5,Joey>We could just slip in,

245
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:42,990
<7-5,Joey>这样谁都不会注意我们的
<7-5,Joey>and no one needs to know where we were.

246
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:47,480
<7-6,Ross>你不把这个泡沫大手指扔掉么
<7-6,Ross>You may want to lose the foam finger.

247
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:49,440
<7-7,Joey>哦  才不呢
<7-7,Joey>Oh, no, no, no.

248
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,190
<7-7,Joey>你只是想把它套在你手上
<7-7,Joey>You just want to put it on your hand.

249
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:57,120
<7-9,Phoebe>你们没在里面
<7-9,Phoebe>You're not at Thanksgiving?

<7-13,Rachel>What are you doing here?

252
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:01,880
<7-14,Ross>我们也迟到了
<7-14,Ross>We're late too.

253
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:03,840
<7-15,Joey>我们本以为我们可以迟到
<7-15,Joey>We figured we could be late

254
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:05,460
<7-15,Joey>因为你们会准时到
<7-15,Joey>because you'd be on time.

255
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:07,720
<7-16,Phoebe>别用这个指着我  姓崔的
<7-16,Phoebe>Don't point that thing at me, Tribbiani.

<7-17,Ross>那...里面没人
<7-17,Ross>So nobody's here?

257
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,550
<7-17,Ross>莫妮卡会杀了我们的
<7-17,Ross>Monica's gonna kill us.

258
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,780
<7-18,Joey>你们到什么地方去了

266
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:35,650
<7-24,Ross>纽约区超级无敌小可爱
<7-24,Ross>"Grand Supreme Little Darling, New York Division"?

267
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,070
<7-25,Rachel>那便是我
<7-25,Rachel>That's me.

268
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,980
<7-26,Ross>你们让艾玛参加了选美比赛
<7-26,Ross>You entered Emma in a beauty pageant?

269
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:46,050
<7-27,Phoebe>而且看起来她还给她化了妆
<7-27,Phoebe>And it looks like she put makeup on her.

270
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,580
<7-28,Joey>等等...
<7-28,Joey>Wait a second...

271
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:51,340
<7-28,Joey>我好像在什么地方见过这身牛仔...
<7-28,Joey>Where have I seen that cowgirl outfit before?

272
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,750
<7-28,Joey>无法置信
<7-28,Joey>I can't believe this.

<7-29,Ross>她是我们的女儿
<7-29,Ross>She's our daughter.

274
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,660
<7-29,Ross>你把她当成观赏狗一样
<7-29,Ross>That you would treat her like some kind of show dog

275
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:58,890
<7-29,Ross>不可饶恕
<7-29,Ross>is inexcusable.

276
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,480
<7-30,Rachel>她为我们赢得了一千美元
<7-30,Rachel>She won a thousand dollars.

<7-31,Ross>So this is an annual thing?

<7-32,Joey>That's Alicia May Emory's outfit!

00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,390
<7-33,Phoebe>伙计们  有人在里面
<7-33,Phoebe>Guys, there are people in there

280
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,880

<7-33,Phoebe>who are not getting any happier.

281
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,220
<7-34,Ross>我们该怎么办
<7-34,Ross>What are we gonna do?

282
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,400
<7-35,Rachel>我不知道  你们想办法
<7-35,Rachel>I don't know, you guys figure it out.

283
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:17,630
<7-35,Rachel>我先把艾玛送回去睡觉
<7-35,Rachel>I gotta put Emma down for a nap.

00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,380
<7-37,Phoebe>好吧  我们该怎么说
<7-37,Phoebe>All right, what are we gonna say?

287
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:27,040
<7-38,Ross>我们可以说  我们被抢劫了
<7-38,Ross>We'll say that we were mugged.

288
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:28,980
<7-38,Ross>当有人被抢了的时候
<7-38,Ross>You can't get mad at someone

289
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,230
<7-38,Ross>你怎么还会生他气
<7-38,Ross>who's been mugged.

290
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,380
<7-39,Phoebe>不错  但你看起来不像被抢过
<7-39,Phoebe>Good. But you don't look like you were mugged.

291
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:33,850
<7-40,Joey>不像  这样才像

00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:43,350
<8-1,Monica>你有没有听到什么
<8-1,Monica>Do you hear something?

294
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:51,310
<8-2,Chandler>-他们都在外面  -让我看看
<8-2,Chandler>- They're out there. - Let me see.

295
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:54,180
<8-2,Chandler>我真不敢相信
<8-2,Chandler>I can't believe this.

296
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:55,280
<8-3,Monica>他们迟到了一小时
<8-3,Monica>They're an hour late,

297
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:57,250
<8-3,Monica>还在那里聊天
<8-3,Monica>and they're just standing there talking.

298
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,790
<8-4,Chandler>一切都乱套了
<8-4,Chandler>Everything's so distorted.

299
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,200
<8-4,Chandler>乔伊有只大手
<8-4,Chandler>It looks like Joey has a giant hand.

300
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,590
<8-4,Chandler>上面写"流浪者"
<8-4,Chandler>That says "Rangers" on it.

301
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,200
<8-4,Chandler>他们去看比赛了
<8-4,Chandler>They went to the game.

302
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:12,040
<8-5,Monica>这下我饶不了他们
<8-5,Monica>Oh, they are in for a world of pain.

303
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,630
<8-6,Chandler>罗斯的衬衫撕坏了
<8-6,Chandler>Ross' shirt is torn.

304
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,700
<8-7,Monica>他们不但迟到  而且衣衫不整
<8-7,Monica>They're late and they're sloppy.

305
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,510
<8-7,Monica>好了  艾玛睡下了
<8-7,Monica>All right, Emma's napping.

306
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,880
<9-1,Rachel>你的衬衫怎么了
<9-1,Rachel>What happened to your shirt?

307
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:24,020
<9-2,Ross>我被抢了
<9-2,Ross>I got mugged,

308
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:25,770
<9-2,Ross>他们还抢走了我的口袋
<9-2,Ross>and they stole my pocket.

309
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:30,560
<9-3,Phoebe>我们是在找借口
<9-3,Phoebe>We're just trying to figure out an excuse.

310
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,090
<9-3,Phoebe>这样如何
<9-3,Phoebe>How about this?

311
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:34,240
<9-3,Phoebe>我们可以说
<9-3,Phoebe>We could say that

312
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:36,230
<9-3,Phoebe>莫妮卡告诉我们是5点  而不是4点
<9-3,Phoebe>Monica told us 5:00, not 4:00.

313
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,690
<9-3,Phoebe>这样我们就没迟到而且很准时
<9-3,Phoebe>That way we're right on time.

314
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:42,250
<9-3,Phoebe>或者  我们可以在房间里藏些迷药
<9-3,Phoebe>Or we could plant PCP in the apartment

315
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,010
<9-3,Phoebe>打电话让警察把她抓了
<9-3,Phoebe>and call the cops on her.

316
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:46,980
<9-4,Ross>嗯  这的确是个
<9-4,Ross>That would be a good way

317
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:49,530
<9-4,Ross>下迷药的好办法
<9-4,Ross>to get rid of all the PCP we have lying around.

318
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,570
<9-5,Rachel>你可以就说她说的是5点
<9-5,Rachel>We'll just say that she said it was 5:00.

319
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:53,710
<9-5,Rachel>保持自然些
<9-5,Rachel>We'll just act casual.

320
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,750
<9-5,Rachel>所以我们根本没有迟到
<9-5,Rachel>We're not late, we're right on time.

321
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,600
<9-6,Ross>"我们知道你们在外面"
<9-6,Ross>"We know you're out there."

322
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:08,670
<9-7,Joey>你觉得这是谁写的
<9-7,Joey>Who do you think it's from?

323
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:20,760
<9-8,Rachel>天啊  糟了  简直太糟了
<9-8,Rachel>Oh, God, this is bad. This is so bad.

324
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:23,120
<9-9,Ross>好吧  让我们进去面对他们吧
<9-9,Ross>Well, let's just go in there and face them.

325
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:24,350
<9-10,Phoebe>我不要先进去
<9-10,Phoebe>I'm not going in first.

326
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,920
<9-10,Phoebe>莫妮卡前额上的青筋肯定快爆裂了
<9-10,Phoebe>I bet that vein on Monica's forehead is popping like crazy.

327
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:29,960
<9-11,Joey>我也讨厌啊
<9-11,Joey>I hate that thing.

328
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:32,010
<9-11,Joey>那张脸就像扭曲的闪电一样
<9-11,Joey>It's like a bolt of lightning.

329
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,750
<9-12,Rachel>我有主意了
<9-12,Rachel>I have an idea.

<9-12,Rachel>我们可以玩石头剪子布
<9-12,Rachel>Why don't we play Rock, Paper, Scissors,

331
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,660
<9-12,Rachel>输了的先进去
<9-12,Rachel>and whoever loses, goes in first.

332
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,610
<9-12,Rachel>-好吧  我参加  -准备
<9-12,Rachel>- All right, I'm in. - Ready.

<9-21,Ross>When they're having sex

344
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,170

<10-1,Monica>The turkey's dried out and the stuffing's all soggy.

<14-2,Chandler>她的血管涨到前所未有的大
<14-2,Chandler>The vein is bigger than I've ever seen it!

00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,140
<14-2,Chandler>我们可以直接把门打开
<14-2,Chandler>We can just unlock the door.

386
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,810
<17-1,Rachel>我不觉得这是个好主意
<17-1,Rachel>I don't know if that's a good idea.

387
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,490
<17-2,Phoebe>他们明显不想和我们在一起
<17-2,Phoebe>They don't wanna be with us.

00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:01,670
<17-3,Rachel>不想在一起也要在一起

451
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:31,130
<17-37,Chandler>你的话可能更可信点
<17-37,Chandler>if you weren't drooling.

<17-38,Rachel>哦  原来是你的口水
