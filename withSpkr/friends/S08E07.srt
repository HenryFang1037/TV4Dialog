1
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,090
<1-2,Chandler>天啊  你打扫过了
<1-2,Chandler>Oh, my God, you cleaned!

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,470
<1-3,Monica>瞧这地板  你还擦了窗户
<1-3,Monica>Look at these floors! You did the windows!

3
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:14,700
<1-3,Monica>我跟你提了好几个月  你真的打扫了
<1-3,Monica>I have been begging you for months! And you did, you cleaned.

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,580
<1-3,Monica>看来唠叨还是有用的
<1-3,Monica>And nagging works!

5
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:19,750
<1-4,Chandler>不  事实上这不是我干的
<1-4,Chandler>No, I didn't actually do this.

6
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,580
<1-5,Monica>不是吧  我又梦游打扫了吗
<1-5,Monica>Oh, no. Was I cleaning in my sleep again?

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,690
<1-6,Chandler>不  也不是你
<1-6,Chandler>No, it wasn't you.

8
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:28,300
<1-8,Chandler>-那么是谁  -我请了一个女佣  耶
<1-8,Chandler>- Well, then, who? - I got a maid. Yay!

9
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:33,400
<1-9,Monica>我希望你所说的"女佣"是指"情妇"
<1-9,Monica>I hope by "maid" you mean "mistress"

10
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,820
<1-9,Monica>因为如果有其他女人在打扫咱家房子的话
<1-9,Monica>because if some other woman was cleaning...

11
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,260
<1-10,Chandler>亲爱的  我知道你不喜欢让出控制权
<1-10,Chandler>Now, honey, I know you don't like to relinquish control.

12
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:42,000
<1-11,Monica>"让出"就是"失去"的委婉说法吧
<1-11,Monica>"Relinquish" is just a fancy word for "lose."

13
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,320
<1-12,Chandler>她人真的很棒
<1-12,Chandler>She's really nice, okay?

14
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,700
<1-12,Chandler>她还说她喜欢你摆放海绵的方式
<1-12,Chandler>And she mentioned that she adored the way you arranged the sponges.

15
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:51,920
<1-13,Monica>她真的那么说了吗
<1-13,Monica>Did she really say that?

16
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,760
<1-14,Chandler>对  我记得很清楚  因为我以为她在开玩笑
<1-14,Chandler>Yes, I distinctly remember because I thought it was a joke.

17
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:57,480
<1-14,Chandler>给她一个机会  好吗
<1-14,Chandler>Now, just give her a chance, okay?

18
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,950
<1-15,Monica>好吧  我办得到
<1-15,Monica>Fine, I can do it.

19
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:03,130
<1-16,Chandler>怎么了
<1-16,Chandler>What's the matter?

20
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,090
<1-17,Monica>通常我一焦虑就会打扫
<1-17,Monica>Usually when I'm this anxious, I clean.

32
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:53,010
<2-1,Phoebe>是谁的手机在响  吵死了
<2-1,Phoebe>Whose cell phone is that? It's just so annoying.

33
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:53,830
<2-1,Phoebe>走到哪里都会发生这种事
<2-1,Phoebe>Everywhere you go.

34
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:55,810
<2-2,Ross>我想声音是从你的包包里传出来的
<2-2,Ross>I think it's coming from your bag.

35
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:00,670
<2-3,Phoebe>从来没有人会打电话给我
<2-3,Phoebe>I never get calls!

36
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,980
<2-3,Phoebe>喂
<2-3,Phoebe>Hello?

37
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:07,660
<2-4,Eric>嗨  我是万圣节派对上的艾力克
<2-4,Eric>Hi, it's Eric, from the Halloween party.

38
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,010
<2-4,Eric>厄休拉的未婚夫
<2-4,Eric>Ursula's fiance.

39
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:12,230
<2-5,Phoebe>天啊  艾力克  嗨
<2-5,Phoebe>Oh, my God, Eric, hi!

40
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,820
<2-5,Phoebe>等一下  你怎么知道我的电话号码
<2-5,Phoebe>Wait, how'd you get this number?

41
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:17,170
<2-6,Eric>我有个警察朋友  他帮我查到的
<2-6,Eric>I have a friend who's a cop, and he got it for me.

42
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:21,490
<2-7,Phoebe>这严重侵犯了我的权利  但却让人又惊又喜
<2-7,Phoebe>Wow. What an incredible violation and wonderful surprise!

43
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:24,420
<2-8,Eric>我想告诉你
<2-8,Eric>Listen, I just... I thought you should know

44
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:25,910
<2-8,Eric>我跟厄休拉分手了
<2-8,Eric>I broke up with Ursula.

45
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:28,310
<2-9,Phoebe>是吗  他办到了
<2-9,Phoebe>Oh, you did? He did it, he did it!

46
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:31,300
<2-10,Rachel>-他做了什么  -我在讲电话
<2-10,Rachel>- What did he do? - I'm talking!

47
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,520
<2-11,Phoebe>总之我很好奇
<2-11,Phoebe>Anyway, I was wondering

48
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:39,350
<2-12,Eric>你平时吃不吃午餐
<2-12,Eric>if you were the sort of person who eats lunch?

49
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,270
<2-13,Phoebe>你是在约我吗
<2-13,Phoebe>Are you asking me out?

50
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:44,110
<2-13,Phoebe>因为那样会很奇怪
<2-13,Phoebe>Because it'd be kind of weird

51
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:46,330
<2-13,Phoebe>你刚刚才跟我姐姐分手
<2-13,Phoebe>since you just broke up with my sister.

52
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:51,530
<2-14,Eric>好吧  抱歉
<2-14,Eric>Yeah, okay. I'm sorry.

53
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:52,360
<2-14,Eric>-再见  -不  等一下
<2-14,Eric>- Bye. - No, no. Wait!

54
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:55,080
<2-15,Phoebe>我那么说是希望你觉得我是个好人
<2-15,Phoebe>I was just saying that so you'd think I was a good person.

55
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,360
<2-15,Phoebe>努力争取我吧
<2-15,Phoebe>Fight for me.

56
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:03,460
<2-16,Eric>我不会轻易接受你的拒绝
<2-16,Eric>I won't take "no" for an answer.

57
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,730
<2-17,Phoebe>虽然表现不太好  但我们可以边吃午餐边练习
<2-17,Phoebe>Not great, but we can work on it at lunch.

58
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:09,320
<2-17,Phoebe>我可以在两小时内赶到你家
<2-17,Phoebe>I can be at your apartment in two hours.

59
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:12,230
<2-18,Eric>太棒了  你怎么知道我住在哪里
<2-18,Eric>Great. How do you know where I live?

60
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:13,670
<2-19,Phoebe>我也有朋友
<2-19,Phoebe>I've got friends too.

61
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,560
<2-19,Phoebe>-好吧  再见  -再见
<2-19,Phoebe>- Okay, bye. - Bye.

62
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:19,630
<2-20,Eric>天啊  我要跟艾力克约会了
<2-20,Eric>Oh, my God, I'm going out with Eric!

63
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:22,090
<2-21,Phoebe>今天比我想像中
<2-21,Phoebe>This day is really gonna be so much better

64
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,040
<2-21,Phoebe>还要美好
<2-21,Phoebe>than I thought it was gonna be.

65
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:26,510
<2-21,Phoebe>罗斯  我没办法跟你吃午餐了
<2-21,Phoebe>Oh, Ross, I can't make lunch.

66
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:33,220
<2-22,Ross>很明显我午餐时间有空
<2-22,Ross>So apparently I'm available for lunch.

67
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:36,360
<2-23,Rachel>不行  我很忙  我在找房子
<2-23,Rachel>I can't. I'm busy. I'm apartment hunting.

68
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,870
<2-24,Ross>你要搬家
<2-24,Ross>You're moving?

69
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:40,800
<2-25,Rachel>孩子生下来后我不可能跟乔伊一起住
<2-25,Rachel>I can't live with Joey once the baby comes.

70
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:42,930
<2-25,Rachel>我不希望我的孩子会说的第一句话是
<2-25,Rachel>I don't want my child's first words to be,

71
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,400
<2-25,Rachel>"你好吗"
<2-25,Rachel>"How you doing?"

72
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,850
<2-26,Ross>乔伊知道你要搬家吗
<2-26,Ross>So does Joey know you're moving?

73
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:51,880
<2-27,Rachel>我还没有跟他谈  但我知道他会觉得如释重负
<2-27,Rachel>I haven't discussed it with him, but I know he'll be relieved.

74
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,930
<2-27,Rachel>上星期他带了一个女孩回家
<2-27,Rachel>Last week, he brought this girl over,

75
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:56,950
<2-27,Rachel>我跟她谈晨吐的问题
<2-27,Rachel>and I talked to her about morning sickness.

76
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,710
<2-27,Rachel>还把我怀孕纪念册的照片拿给她看
<2-27,Rachel>Then I showed her pictures from my pregnancy book.

77
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:02,660
<2-28,Ross>-内容不会很色情吧  -不太会
<2-28,Ross>- That's not really porn? - Not so much.

78
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,910
<2-30,Ross>既然你在找房子
<2-30,Ross>You know what? If you're looking for a place,

79
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,690
<2-30,Ross>今早我在电梯里听说
<2-30,Ross>I just heard in the elevator this morning

80
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:10,030
<2-30,Ross>我住的公寓里有个女住户过世了
<2-30,Ross>that a woman in my building died.

81
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:13,360
<2-31,Rachel>天啊  她年纪很老了吗
<2-31,Rachel>Oh, my God. Was she old?

82
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,060
<2-31,Rachel>她的公寓景观好吗
<2-31,Rachel>Does she have a view?

83
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,810
<2-32,Ross>我不知道  但那样一定会很棒
<2-32,Ross>I don't know, but how great would that be?

84
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,610
<2-32,Ross>你搬到我的公寓里来
<2-32,Ross>You living in my building?

85
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:24,890
<2-32,Ross>我可以照顾宝宝  想过去就过去...
<2-32,Ross>I could take care of the baby, I could come over whenever I want...

86
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,690
<2-32,Ross>当然得先得到你的允许
<2-32,Ross>...with your permission.

87
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,790
<2-34,Ross>那就太好了  我们能去看看吗
<2-34,Ross>That really would be great. Well, can we see it?

88
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,380
<2-35,Rachel>或许我们不该那么做
<2-35,Rachel>Maybe we shouldn't.

89
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,840
<2-35,Rachel>毕竟她今天早上才过世
<2-35,Rachel>I mean, if she just died this morning out of respect.

90
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,700
<2-36,Ross>对  你说得对
<2-36,Ross>Yeah. No. No, you're right.

91
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,590
<2-37,Rachel>-我们去吧  -好啊
<2-37,Rachel>- Shall we? - Yeah.

92
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:53,750
<2-37,Rachel>有什么事吗
<2-37,Rachel>Yes?

93
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,830
<3-1,Ross>嗨  我是罗斯·盖勒  住在这栋公寓里
<3-1,Ross>Hi. I'm Ross Geller. I live in the building.

94
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,590
<3-2,Rachel>我是瑞秋  我很喜欢这栋公寓
<3-2,Rachel>And I'm Rachel, an admirer of the building.

95
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:05,770
<3-3,Ross>听说佛哈芬太太过世了
<3-3,Ross>I heard about Mrs. Verhoeven passing away,

96
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:08,160
<3-3,Ross>我真的很遗憾
<3-3,Ross>and I am so sorry for your loss.

97
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,410
<3-4,Ross>-她没有过世  -什么
<3-4,Ross>- She didn't pass away. - What?

98
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,190
<3-4,Ross>我妈妈还活着
<3-4,Ross>My mother's still alive.

99
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:14,280
<3-5,Ross>谢天谢地
<3-5,Ross>Oh, thank God!

100
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,810
<3-6,Rachel>她今天早上差点就过世了
<3-6,Rachel>It looked like we were gonna lose her this morning,

101
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:21,160
<3-6,Rachel>但她是个意志力很强的老太婆
<3-6,Rachel>but she's a tough old bird.

102
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:23,870
<3-6,Rachel>你跟她很熟吗
<3-6,Rachel>Are you close with her?

103
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:28,760
<3-7,Ross>当然  我们常常
<3-7,Ross>Of course. She and I would talk all the time...

104
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,290
<3-7,Ross>在洗衣间聊天
<3-7,Ross>...in the laundry room.

105
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,870
<3-7,Ross>你会说荷兰语吗
<3-7,Ross>You speak Dutch?

106
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:38,180
<3-8,Ross>很荣幸见到我母亲的朋友[荷兰语]
<3-8,Ross>I'm very honored to meet a friend of my mother.

107
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:44,340
<3-8,Ross>我会说  但说起来只会让我伤心
<3-8,Ross>You know, I would, but it's just too painful.

108
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,310
<3-9,Rachel>她真的没死
<3-9,Rachel>So she's really not dead.

109
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:51,690
<3-10,Rachel>对  她还在坚持
<3-10,Rachel>No. She's hanging in there.

110
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:57,440
<3-10,Rachel>你能告诉我她是在一房还是两房里坚持吗
<3-10,Rachel>Could you tell me, is she hanging in in a one-bedroom or a two?

111
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:05,520
<4-1,Brenda>宾太太  这个清洁剂太棒了
<4-1,Brenda>Mrs. Bing, this tile cleaner is incredible.

00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,550
<14-2,Monica>你在哪里买的
<14-2,Monica>Where did you get it?

113
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:09,430
<4-1,Brenda>那是我自制的
<4-1,Brenda>Oh, well... I make it myself.

114
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,390
<4-2,Monica>两份的氨水加一份的柠檬汁
<4-2,Monica>It's two parts ammonia and one part lemon juice.

<4-3,Brenda>When I come back, I'll clean behind the refrigerator.

<4-6,Monica>Okay.

122
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,080
<4-7,Chandler>看吧  我告诉过你
<4-7,Chandler>See? I told you.

123
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,170
<4-8,Monica>她偷了我的牛仔裤
<4-8,Monica>She stole my jeans!

124
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,910
<4-9,Chandler>什么
<4-9,Chandler>What?

125
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,970
<4-10,Monica>我找了一个星期  她正穿在身上
<4-10,Monica>I've been looking for them all week, and she is wearing them.

126
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,450
<4-11,Chandler>所以她偷了你的裤子
<4-11,Chandler>So she stole your pants

127
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:50,600
<4-11,Chandler>然后当着你的面穿在身上
<4-11,Chandler>and then came back and wore them in front of you?

128
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:53,750
<4-12,Monica>你不明白吗  这是完美犯罪
<4-12,Monica>Don't you see? It's the perfect crime!

129
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:57,230
<4-13,Chandler>她一定计划了好几年
<4-13,Chandler>She must have been planning this for years!

130
00:06:58,210 --> 00:06:59,600
<4-14,Monica>我会证明给你看
<4-14,Monica>I'll prove it to you, okay.

131
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,900
<4-14,Monica>几周前  我穿着那条牛仔裤
<4-14,Monica>About a week ago I was wearing those jeans

132
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,170
<4-14,Monica>我把钢笔掉在大腿上
<4-14,Monica>and I dropped a pen in my lap,

133
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:04,920
<4-14,Monica>在裆部留下了墨水印子
<4-14,Monica>and it left an ink stain on the crotch.

134
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,450
<4-14,Monica>她回来后
<4-14,Monica>When she comes back,

135
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,840
<4-14,Monica>我就让你看看那个墨水印子
<4-14,Monica>I will find it and show you that stain!

136
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:14,510
<4-15,Chandler>亲爱的  卖那条牛仔裤的公司
<4-15,Chandler>Honey, isn't it possible the company that sold the jeans

137
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:16,840
<4-15,Chandler>难道只做了一条牛仔裤吗
<4-15,Chandler>made more than just the one pair?

138
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:18,990
<4-16,Monica>说得有道理
<4-16,Monica>I guess.

139
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:21,030
<4-17,Chandler>我们应该先找找看
<4-17,Chandler>So should't we give her the benefit of the doubt

140
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:24,580
<4-17,Chandler>再去看她的裆部吧
<4-17,Chandler>before we go snooping around her crotch?

141
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:30,690
<4-18,Monica>好吧  幸好我没告诉她我的秘方
<4-18,Monica>Fine. I'm just glad I didn't give her my secret ingredient.

142
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:33,130
<4-19,Chandler>我真的很好奇你的秘方是什么
<4-19,Chandler>Out of curiosity, what is your secret ingredient?

143
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:34,500
<5-1,Phoebe>你想得美
<5-1,Phoebe>Yeah.

144
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:43,060
<5-2,Eric>请进  我很高兴你能过来
<5-2,Eric>Come in. I'm so glad you're here.

145
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,010
<5-3,Phoebe>对  我也是
<5-3,Phoebe>Yeah. Me too.

146
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,820
<5-3,Phoebe>但不像你那么震惊愤怒
<5-3,Phoebe>Not in the shaky, angry way that you are, though.

147
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,800
<5-4,Eric>抱歉  我刚刚见过厄休拉
<5-4,Eric>Sorry. I just saw Ursula.

148
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,040
<5-4,Eric>我得把订婚戒指拿回来
<5-4,Eric>I had to get the engagement ring back.

149
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:55,950
<5-6,Eric>看到她  让我想起了一切
<5-6,Eric>Just seeing her brought it all back.

150
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,620
<5-6,Eric>那些谎言  还有她是怎么利用我的
<5-6,Eric>All the lies, the way she used me.

151
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,500
<5-6,Eric>我只是...
<5-6,Eric>I just...

152
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:04,090
<5-6,Eric>光是看到她  我就觉得好生气...
<5-6,Eric>I get so angry, just looking at her...

153
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:11,620
<5-7,Phoebe>-我是说看到她的脸  -对
<5-7,Phoebe>- Face. - Yeah. Yeah.

154
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:17,140
<5-8,Eric>抱歉  我看到你的时候
<5-8,Eric>I'm sorry. It's just, when I look at you...

155
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,430
<5-8,Eric>我就像是看到了她
<5-8,Eric>...I see her.

156
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,430
<5-8,Eric>我看到她时
<5-8,Eric>And when I see her,

157
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:25,270
<5-8,Eric>就会觉得很生气
<5-8,Eric>I get a little bit angry.

158
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,830
<5-9,Phoebe>-这样太奇怪了  -等一下
<5-9,Phoebe>- Maybe this is too weird. - Wait.

159
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:34,510
<5-10,Eric>只有我看着你的时候才会觉得生气
<5-10,Eric>There's only a problem when I look at you.

160
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:37,690
<5-10,Eric>我知道了
<5-10,Eric>I got it. I got it.

161
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:41,210
<5-11,Phoebe>不  别把你的眼睛挖出来
<5-11,Phoebe>No, don't tear out your eyes!

162
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:44,270
<5-12,Eric>我只是要把隐形眼镜摘掉
<5-12,Eric>I was just gonna take out my lenses.

163
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:45,960
<5-13,Phoebe>好吧  试试看
<5-13,Phoebe>Oh, yeah. Try that.

164
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:50,670
<5-13,Phoebe>那样子好多了吗
<5-13,Phoebe>So is that better?

165
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:52,870
<5-13,Phoebe>才怪
<5-13,Phoebe>Not really.

166
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:59,470
<5-14,Eric>你看起来很模糊  还是很像厄休拉
<5-14,Eric>You're blurry, but you still look like Ursula.

167
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:00,790
<5-14,Eric>你是"模糊的厄休拉"
<5-14,Eric>You're "Blursula."

168
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:06,420
<5-14,Eric>好吧  等一下  也许
<5-14,Eric>Okay, wait. Maybe...

169
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,920
<5-14,Eric>我暂时不看你
<5-14,Eric>If I just don't look at you for a while.

170
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,590
<5-14,Eric>看吧  很有效果  我一点都不生气了
<5-14,Eric>See? It works. I'm not angry at all anymore.

171
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:18,700
<5-14,Eric>这次约会很成功
<5-14,Eric>This is a great date!

<5-15,Phoebe>我喜欢你  但不应该这么纠结
<5-15,Phoebe>I like you, but it shouldn't be this hard.

00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,580
<5-15,Phoebe>这是我们第一次约会
<5-15,Phoebe>This is our first date.

175
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:33,660
<5-15,Phoebe>第一次约会应该是兴奋刺激  火花四射
<5-15,Phoebe>First dates are supposed to be about excitement and electricity and...

176
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:36,220
<5-15,Phoebe>"他刚刚摸了我的手  他是有意的吗 "
<5-15,Phoebe>..."He just touched my hand, did he mean to touch my hand"

<8-7,Rachel>Yeah. Hopefully across the street.

222
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:35,440
<8-7,Rachel>如果那些荷兰人愿意让出公寓
<8-7,Rachel>If certain Dutch people would just let go.

223
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,650
<8-8,Joey>我希望你留下来
<8-8,Joey>I was kind of hoping you'd stay.

224
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:44,550
<8-9,Rachel>乔伊  我得搬走  这里容不下一个宝宝
<8-9,Rachel>Joey, I have to go. There's no room for a baby here.

225
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,490
<8-9,Rachel>容不下  宝宝也就这么大吧
<8-9,Rachel>No room? It's a baby. It's, like, this big.

226
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:52,430
<8-10,Joey>你可以把他放在这里
<8-10,Joey>You could put it over here.

227
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:57,110
<8-10,Joey>或是这里  很可爱吧
<8-10,Joey>Or we could put it right here. It's cute, right?

228
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:00,640
<8-10,Joey>或是这里  你根本就不会注意到他
<8-10,Joey>Or put it over here. You wouldn't even notice it.

229
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,690
<8-10,Joey>"宝宝在哪里 "  "他就在..."
<8-10,Joey>"Where's the baby?" "Oh, it's right over..."

230
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:08,650
<8-11,Rachel>亲爱的  问题不仅在于要把他放在哪里
<8-11,Rachel>Honey, it's not just a matter of where you put it.

00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,550
<8-11,Rachel>宝宝会让你的生活翻天覆地
<8-11,Rachel>A baby changes everything.

00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:12,310
<8-11,Rachel>他们总是哭个不停
<8-11,Rachel>They cry all the time.

233
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:14,240
<8-11,Rachel>如果你带女孩回家
<8-11,Rachel>Imagine bringing home some girl

234
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,310
<8-11,Rachel>想跟她上床时  宝宝却哭个不停
<8-11,Rachel>and trying to score with a screaming baby around.

235
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:20,340
<8-12,Joey>我可以接受这个挑战  算不上什么难事
<8-12,Joey>I could use a challenge. It's getting pretty easy.

236
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:23,530
<8-13,Rachel>你要我留下来  真的很贴心
<8-13,Rachel>It's so sweet that you want me to stay,

237
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:25,090
<8-13,Rachel>但我不能那么对你
<8-13,Rachel>but I can't do that to you.

238
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,250
<8-13,Rachel>那样会毁了你的生活
<8-13,Rachel>It would disrupt your entire life.

239
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,000
<8-13,Rachel>只是...
<8-13,Rachel>It's just...

240
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,460
<8-14,Joey>我很喜欢跟你一起住
<8-14,Joey>I love living with you so much.

<8-14,Joey>-我希望一切都不必改变  -我知道
<8-14,Joey>- I wish things didn't have to change. - I know.

242
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,540
<8-16,Joey>这件事全怪罗斯
<8-16,Joey>You know, I blame Ross for this.

243
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:44,210
<8-17,Rachel>我也有点怪他
<8-17,Rachel>I do too, a little bit.

244
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:47,550
<8-18,Joey>我会想念你的
<8-18,Joey>I'm gonna miss you.

00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,630
<8-18,Joey>你是我遇过最辣的室友
<8-18,Joey>You're the hottest roommate I ever had.

246
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:01,180
<9-1,Phoebe>不行  我得走了  有人预约我去按摩
<9-1,Phoebe>Oh, no, I have to go. I have a massage appointment.

247
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:02,940
<9-2,Eric>别  留下来  我们继续吧
<9-2,Eric>No, stay here. We'll keep doing this.

248
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,270
<9-2,Eric>我可以付钱给你
<9-2,Eric>I'll pay you.

249
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,790
<9-3,Phoebe>不行  之前我因为这个惹上了大麻烦
<9-3,Phoebe>No, I've gotten in trouble for that before.

250
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,560
<9-3,Phoebe>-待会见  -没问题
<9-3,Phoebe>- I'll see you later? - Absolutely.

251
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,880
<9-4,Eric>我喜欢你的吻技
<9-4,Eric>I love the way you kiss.

252
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:19,110
<9-5,Phoebe>真的吗  那是我最逊的方面
<9-5,Phoebe>Really? That's the thing I'm worst at!

253
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,840
<10-2,Monica>你等着瞧吧
<10-2,Monica>You'll see.

254
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:32,010
<10-3,Chandler>-我觉得布兰达需要加薪  -为什么
<10-3,Chandler>- Hey. I think Brenda needs a raise. - How come?

255
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:34,040
<10-4,Monica>因为我把头放在她的双腿之间
<10-4,Monica>Because I put my head between her legs.

256
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:37,990
<10-5,Chandler>-为了看她的裤子吗  -那是我的裤子
<10-5,Chandler>- To see her pants? - They're my pants!

257
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:39,980
<10-6,Monica>你确定吗  你看到墨水印子了吗
<10-6,Monica>Are you sure? Did you see the stain?

258
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:43,760
<10-8,Monica>没有  我才刚刚就位  就眼前一片漆黑
<10-8,Monica>No. I was getting into position, and then everything went dark.

259
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:48,450
<10-9,Chandler>她没有偷我们的东西  你能不能算了
<10-9,Chandler>She is not stealing from us, okay. Will you let this go?

260
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,480
<10-10,Monica>好吧
<10-10,Monica>Fine.

261
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:58,290
<10-11,Chandler>-她穿着我的胸罩  -天啊
<10-11,Chandler>- She's wearing my bra! - Oh, dear God!

262
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:02,330
<10-12,Monica>我的粉红色小花胸罩  我认得那条肩带
<10-12,Monica>My pink, flowered bra! I recognize the strap!

263
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:05,070
<10-13,Chandler>那你没意识到自己疯了吗
<10-13,Chandler>Yet you don't recognize that you're crazy?

264
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:06,850
<10-14,Monica>我有个计划
<10-14,Monica>Here's the plan.

265
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:09,670
<10-14,Monica>我先离开  你去看布兰达的胸罩
<10-14,Monica>I'm going to leave, and you're gonna look at Brenda's bra.

266
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:10,960
<10-15,Chandler>我也有个计划
<10-15,Chandler>Here's another plan.

267
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:12,570
<10-15,Chandler>不要
<10-15,Chandler>No.

268
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:16,150
<10-16,Monica>本可以由我来做  但她以为我喜欢她
<10-16,Monica>I would do it, but she thinks I'm attracted to her.

269
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:16,930
<10-17,Chandler>为什么
<10-17,Chandler>Why?

270
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,870
<10-18,Monica>你不知道刚刚我的头插到哪里了吗
<10-18,Monica>Did you not hear where my head was?

271
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,680
<10-18,Monica>我们是一帮的  在这件事上应该同进退
<10-18,Monica>Come on, come on. We're a team. We're in this together.

272
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:26,900
<10-19,Chandler>我担心陪审团也会那么认为
<10-19,Chandler>I fear a jury will see it the same way.

273
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,880
<10-20,Monica>就算是为了我
<10-20,Monica>Do this for me.

274
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:32,350
<10-20,Monica>我常抓到你在瞄女人胸部
<10-20,Monica>I catch you looking at womers breasts all the time.

275
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:33,620
<10-21,Chandler>你看到了吗
<10-21,Chandler>You see that?

276
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:35,840
<10-22,Monica>这样难道你看不到吗
<10-22,Monica>Do you see this?

277
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,330
<10-23,Chandler>好吧  我了解你的意思
<10-23,Chandler>All right, yes. Okay. I get your point.

278
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:42,700
<10-23,Chandler>但如果那不是你的胸罩
<10-23,Chandler>But if it's not your bra,

279
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,320
<10-23,Chandler>你能让她接着安心打扫吗
<10-23,Chandler>will you just let the woman clean the apartment?

280
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,810
<10-24,Monica>没问题
<10-24,Monica>Yes. Absolutely.

281
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:48,370
<10-24,Monica>是不是我的你能分辨出来  因为在右罩杯上
<10-24,Monica>You'll know it's mine because on the right cup,

282
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:51,200
<10-24,Monica>蕾丝的部分  有明显的开线
<10-24,Monica>the lacey part, there's a very noticeable rip.

283
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,980
<10-25,Chandler>你需要买新衣服了
<10-25,Chandler>You need new clothes.

284
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:03,140
<11-1,Ross>-她还好吗  -情况看起来不妙
<11-1,Ross>- Hi. How is she? - It's not looking good.

285
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:10,900
<11-2,Ross>我带了一些花过来给她
<11-2,Ross>Well, I brought her some bloemen.

286
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:15,640
<11-2,Ross>你太体贴了  你要跟她送别吗
<11-2,Ross>That's so sweet. Would you like to come in and say goodbye?

287
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,350
<11-3,Ross>那对她来说一定意义重大
<11-3,Ross>I'm sure it would mean a lot to her.

288
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,110
<11-3,Ross>这我还真没想到
<11-3,Ross>Oh, I don't know that it would.

289
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:24,660
<11-4,Ross>-她几乎不记得任何人了  -那么好吧
<11-4,Ross>- Well, her memory is pretty much gone. - All right, then.

290
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,680
<12-4,Eric>欢迎你回来
<12-4,Eric>Welcome back.

291
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:39,830
<12-5,Phoebe>我们要继续吗
<12-5,Phoebe>Shall we pick up from where we left off?

292
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:42,920
<12-6,Eric>今天下午过后  我还没缓过劲来
<12-6,Eric>I don't know. I'm still tired from this afternoon.

293
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,510
<12-7,Phoebe>-为什么  -我们做爱了
<12-7,Phoebe>- Why? - The sex.

294
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:47,490
<12-8,Eric>-什么  -你跟我做爱了
<12-8,Eric>- What sex? - Our sex.

295
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:49,120
<12-9,Phoebe>我们没做爱啊
<12-9,Phoebe>We didn't have sex.

296
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,330
<12-10,Eric>如果我没跟你做爱
<12-10,Eric>If I didn't have sex with you,

297
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:52,960
<12-10,Eric>我一定是跟一个长得跟你很像...
<12-10,Eric>I had sex with somebody that looked an awful lot like...

298
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:58,130
<12-12,Eric>不会吧
<12-12,Eric>Oh, no. Oh, no.

299
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:00,330
<12-12,Eric>不会吧
<12-12,Eric>No, no, no.

300
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:04,200
<12-13,Phoebe>-你跟厄休拉做爱了  -做了一点
<12-13,Phoebe>- You had sex with Ursula? - A little bit.

301
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:07,720
<12-14,Eric>她走进来  我以为她是你  我吻了她...
<12-14,Eric>She walked in, I thought she was you and I kissed her and...

302
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,810
<12-15,Phoebe>你没注意到衣服不一样吗
<12-15,Phoebe>You didn't notice different clothes?

303
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:12,010
<12-16,Eric>我看到你太兴奋了
<12-16,Eric>I was just so excited to see you.

304
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:18,860
<12-17,Phoebe>这真的是太奇怪了
<12-17,Phoebe>You know what? This is too weird.

305
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,830
<12-18,Eric>不会的  我不想失去你
<12-18,Eric>No, it's not. I don't wanna lose you.

306
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:22,140
<12-18,Eric>在做爱的时候
<12-18,Eric>It's like I was saying to Ursula

307
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,680
<12-18,Eric>我以为厄休拉是你  我对她说...
<12-18,Eric>when I was making love to her and I thought she was you...

308
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:26,390
<12-18,Eric>对  那太奇怪了
<12-18,Eric>Yeah. It's too weird.

309
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:30,620
<12-19,Phoebe>那就到此为止吧
<12-19,Phoebe>So I guess this is it.

310
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:32,790
<12-19,Phoebe>好
<12-19,Phoebe>Yeah.

311
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:36,330
<12-20,Eric>或许这是最好的办法
<12-20,Eric>Maybe it's for the best.

312
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:40,210
<12-20,Eric>-你的味道跟她一样  -对  你也是
<12-20,Eric>- You smell just like her. - Yeah, so do you.

313
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:03,190
<13-1,Brenda>-你在做什么  -我在屈伸
<13-1,Brenda>- What are you doing? - I'm leaning.

314
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,170
<13-2,Chandler>我都在这里做屈伸运动
<13-2,Chandler>This is where I lean.

315
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,150
<13-3,Brenda>好吧
<13-3,Brenda>Okay.

316
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:14,490
<13-4,Chandler>-布兰达  有蜜蜂  -什么
<13-4,Chandler>- Brenda, a bee! - What?

317
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,030
<13-6,Chandler>它飞进你上衣里了
<13-6,Chandler>Yes! It's flown into your blouse,

318
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:19,290
<13-6,Chandler>你最好快解开扣子  免得被叮伤
<13-6,Chandler>and you better undo your buttons lest it sting you.

319
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,720
<13-7,Brenda>-我想我知道这是怎么一回事了  -是吗
<13-7,Brenda>- I think I know what's going on here. - You do?

320
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:29,020
<13-9,Brenda>你太太是女同志  我知道你一定很难受
<13-9,Brenda>Look, I know it must be hard that your wife is a lesbian...

321
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:35,190
<13-9,Brenda>但这是不对的  你结婚了
<13-9,Brenda>...but it's wrong. You're married.

322
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:37,990
<13-10,Chandler>-我完全了解  -太好了
<13-10,Chandler>- I totally understand. - Okay, good.

323
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,460
<13-10,Chandler>我能看看你的胸罩吗
<13-10,Chandler>Could I just see your bra?

324
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,920
<14-3,Rachel>-你怎么会有那条牛仔裤  -是你送我的
<14-3,Rachel>- Where'd you get those jeans? - You gave them to me.

325
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,960
<14-4,Monica>-我才没有  -好吧  是我自己拿的
<14-4,Monica>- No, I didn't! - All right, I took them.

326
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,200
<14-5,Rachel>我以为你不会介意
<14-5,Rachel>I figured it'd be okay

327
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:59,000
<14-5,Rachel>因为在裆部的地方有一大块墨水印子
<14-5,Rachel>because you've got a big ink stain on the crotch.

328
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:02,010
<14-6,Monica>不要啊  你也拿走了我的胸罩吗
<14-6,Monica>Oh, no! Did you take my bra too?

329
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:02,950
<14-7,Rachel>什么胸罩
<14-7,Rachel>What bra?

330
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:04,810
<14-8,Monica>有小花的粉红色胸罩
<14-8,Monica>The pink one with the flowers.

331
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:07,110
<14-9,Rachel>你是说你正穿的这件胸罩吗
<14-9,Rachel>You mean the one you're wearing?

332
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,650
<14-10,Brenda>我不干了
<14-10,Brenda>I quit!

333
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:15,700
<14-11,Monica>可以理解
<14-11,Monica>Sounds about right.

334
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,680
<15-1,Rachel>这是什么
<15-1,Rachel>What is this?

335
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:27,280
<15-2,Joey>我只是做一下大致构想
<15-2,Joey>This is just to give you an idea.

336
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,070
<15-2,Joey>我们可以在这里装拉帘  给宝宝留有隐私
<15-2,Joey>We can put screens here so that the baby has privacy...

337
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:34,410
<15-2,Joey>在摇篮上面装个音乐铃
<15-2,Joey>...and maybe a mobile over the crib...

338
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:36,400
<15-2,Joey>这是宝宝监控器
<15-2,Joey>...and here's a baby monitor

339
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,540
<15-2,Joey>宝宝没出生前  我们可以把它当对讲机
<15-2,Joey>which, till the baby comes, we can use as walkie-talkies.

340
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:43,780
<15-3,Rachel>你真的是太体贴了
<15-3,Rachel>You're so sweet!

341
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,680
<15-3,Rachel>天啊  你帮宝宝买了企鹅宝宝
<15-3,Rachel>Oh, my God! And you gave the baby Hugsy!

342
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:58,360
<15-4,Joey>我只是要向你示范宝宝该躺在哪里
<15-4,Joey>That's really just to show where the baby would go.

343
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,930
<15-4,Joey>快把它交给我吧  免得你误会了
<15-4,Joey>Why don't I hold on to him so there's no confusion.

344
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:09,630
<15-5,Rachel>乔伊  宝宝会哭的  那会非常地吵
<15-5,Rachel>Joey, the baby is gonna be crying. It's gonna be loud.

345
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:12,140
<15-6,Joey>-我本身就很吵  -他会整晚不睡
<15-6,Joey>- I'm loud. - It's gonna be up all night.

346
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:14,800
<15-7,Rachel>-我也会  -他会大便
<15-7,Rachel>- I'm up all night. - It's gonna poop.

347
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,420
<15-10,Joey>难道我不是吗
<15-10,Joey>Hello!

348
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,460
<15-11,Rachel>那你带回家的姑娘们怎么办
<15-11,Rachel>What about all the women you wanna bring home?

349
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,030
<15-12,Joey>如果我把一个姑娘带回家
<15-12,Joey>Look. If I'm bringing home a woman

350
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:24,340
<15-12,Joey>她连和宝宝相处都做不到
<15-12,Joey>who can't stand being around a baby...

351
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:26,750
<15-12,Joey>那或许我根本不该跟那个姑娘在一起
<15-12,Joey>...then maybe I don't wanna be with that woman.

352
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:30,650
<15-12,Joey>或许我们该在酒吧的洗手间里做爱
<15-12,Joey>Or maybe we'll do it in the bathroom of the club!

353
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,000
<15-13,Rachel>乔伊  你确定吗
<15-13,Rachel>Joey, are you sure?

354
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,190
<15-14,Joey>对  听着  我知道有时候会很辛苦
<15-14,Joey>Yeah. Look, I know sometimes it'll be hard, okay...

355
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:43,410
<15-14,Joey>但同时也会非常幸福愉快
<15-14,Joey>...but it'll also be really, really great.

356
