<2-2,Rachel>Why don't we just take me and put me with a Manattan in my hand...

67
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,630
<2-2,Rachel>让我和帅哥酒保聊天
<2-2,Rachel>...talking to the cute bartender.

<2-5,Monica>钱德勒  放松  这又不是比赛

81
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,520
<2-12,Monica>你父母会坐在皇后区的家里
<2-12,Monica>...then your parents would be over here at home in Queens.

82
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,890
<2-13,Joey>他们竟然没被邀请
<2-13,Joey>They're not invited?

<2-13,Joey>这太糟糕了  他们一定会很伤心

84
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:44,490
<2-14,Monica>为什么他们会以为自己被邀请了呢
<2-14,Monica>Why would they think they're invited?

85

<2-15,Joey>你问倒我了  我不...
<2-15,Joey>You got me. I don't...

00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,580
<2-23,Monica>好  也许能把他们排进来
<2-23,Monica>All right. Maybe I can fit them in

95
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,610
<2-23,Monica>不过要重新安排位子
<2-23,Monica>if I just do some rearranging.

96
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:19,340
<2-23,Monica>瑞秋可能要坐在吧台
<2-23,Monica>Rachel may actually have to sit at the bar.

97
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,080
<2-24,Rachel>没有问题
<2-24,Rachel>That is not a problem.

98
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:24,020

<4-23,Rachel>我有个大学朋友
<4-23,Rachel>Come on. I had this friend from college ...

157
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:24,510
<4-23,Rachel>我不应该告诉乔伊  有一次...
<4-23,Rachel>...and I made the mistake of telling Joey that one time...

158
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:28,800
<4-23,Rachel>她和我接吻了...
<4-23,Rachel>...she and I, you know, kissed a little bit.

159
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,780
<4-24,Phoebe>是啊  肯定有这么回事
<4-24,Phoebe>Yeah, I'm sure that happened.

160
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,840
<4-25,Rachel>-是真的  -当然

161
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:40,720
<4-27,Joey>真的发生了
<4-27,Joey>Hey. It happened.

162
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:47,010
<4-28,Rachel>是大四那年  有次夏威夷舞会之后
<4-28,Rachel>It was senior year in college. It was after the Sigma Chi luau...

163
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:49,620
<4-28,Rachel>我和梅莉莎喝得大醉
<4-28,Rachel>...and Melissa and I got very drunk.

164
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,960
<4-28,Rachel>结果我们两个接吻了
<4-28,Rachel>And we ended up kissing.

165
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,880
<4-28,Rachel>好几分钟呢
<4-28,Rachel>For several minutes.

166
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,420
<4-29,Phoebe>也就是说她喝了几杯汽酒
<4-29,Phoebe>Which means she had a couple spritzers

167
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,340
<4-29,Phoebe>轻轻吻在脸颊上
<4-29,Phoebe>and a quick peck on the cheek.

168
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,770
<4-30,Joey>你为什么要让我幻灭呢
<4-30,Joey>Why are you taking this away from me?

169
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:04,830
<4-31,Rachel>你为什么就不相信呢
<4-31,Rachel>Why is it so hard for you to believe?

170
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:08,430
<4-32,Phoebe>好吧  我不知道你是同性恋
<4-32,Phoebe>Okay. I just didn't know that you were a lesbian.

171
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:18,040
<4-33,Rachel>我没说我是同性恋
<4-33,Rachel>I'm not saying that I'm a lesbian.

172
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,630
<4-33,Rachel>我只是说那件事真的发生了
<4-33,Rachel>I'm just saying that this happened.

173
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:24,890
<4-34,Phoebe>这件事太狂野了  而你却这么地...
<4-34,Phoebe>It just seems pretty wild. And you're so...

174
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:26,600
<4-35,Rachel>乖宝宝
<4-35,Rachel>...vanilla.

175
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,500
<4-36,Phoebe>乖宝宝  我不是乖宝宝  我做很多疯狂的事
<4-36,Phoebe>Vanilla? I'm not vanilla. I do lots of crazy things.

176
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:36,090
<4-37,Rachel>我喝醉了  在拉斯维加斯结了婚
<4-37,Rachel>I mean, I got drunk and married in Vegas.

177
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:37,480
<4-38,Phoebe>和罗斯而已
<4-38,Phoebe>To Ross.

178
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:40,680
<4-39,Rachel>如果你不相信我...
<4-39,Rachel>If you don't believe me about this,

179
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,870
<4-39,Rachel>今晚就和我一起去吃饭
<4-39,Rachel>why don't you just come with me to dinner tonight

180
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,420
<4-39,Rachel>她会告诉你的
<4-39,Rachel>and she'll tell you.

181
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:47,530
<4-40,Phoebe>好吧  可是我想像不出来
<4-40,Phoebe>Okay, all right. Because I can't picture it.

182
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:49,660
<4-41,Joey>你该看看我脑袋里的画面
<4-41,Joey>You should get inside my head.

183
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:57,960
<5-1,Ross>猜我为你的婚礼搞到了什么
<5-1,Ross>Guess what I got for your wedding?

184
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:01,000
<5-2,Chandler>头像晾衣架  瘦巴巴的女伴
<5-2,Chandler>A freakishly thin date with a hanger for a head?

185
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:06,180
<5-3,Ross>瑞秋替我弄到一件燕尾服  但不是随便一件
<5-3,Ross>Rachel hooked me up with a tux. But not just any tux.

186
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:07,890
<5-3,Ross>是蝙蝠侠穿过的
<5-3,Ross>Batman's tux!

187
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,150
<5-4,Chandler>-什么  -没错
<5-4,Chandler>- What? - That's right.

188
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:12,470
<5-5,Ross>是为方·基默加急赶制的
<5-5,Ross>Made expressly for Val Kilmer,

189
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:14,860
<5-5,Ross>他穿着出演了票房冠军电影...
<5-5,Ross>and worn by him in the hit film...

190
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,580
<5-5,Ross>就是他演的那部蝙幅侠电影
<5-5,Ross>...that Batman film he was in.

191
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,790
<5-6,Chandler>你不能穿那件  我才要穿名人的燕尾服
<5-6,Chandler>You can't wear that. I'm wearing the famous tux.

192
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,790
<5-7,Ross>-詹姆斯·邦德的燕尾服  -怎样
<5-7,Ross>- James Bond's tux! - So?

193
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:25,950
<5-8,Chandler>怎样  如果你穿那件  我就显不出特别了
<5-8,Chandler>So? If you wear that, it'll make mine less special.

194
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,210
<5-9,Ross>你的大喜日子本身还不够特别吗
<5-9,Ross>You need something to make this day special?

195
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:32,050
<5-9,Ross>喂  你拥有最特别的一样
<5-9,Ross>Hello! You have the most special thing of all.

00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:35,750
<5-9,Ross>你要迎娶你最爱的女人
<5-9,Ross>You are marrying the woman you love.

197
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,060
<5-10,Chandler>不要抢走我的风头  拜托
<5-10,Chandler>Please don't take away my cool thing. Please. Pretty please?

198
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:46,660
<5-11,Ross>"拜托"  这可不像007的语气
<5-11,Ross>"Pretty please?" Not very 007.

199
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,170
<5-12,Chandler>那可是我的大喜日子
<5-12,Chandler>Look, it's my wedding day okay?

200
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:51,580
<5-12,Chandler>如果你要结婚  我不会做任何惹你生气的事
<5-12,Chandler>If you were getting married, I'd never do anything to upset you.

201
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,390
<5-13,Ross>我结婚的时候  你和我妹妹上床了
<5-13,Ross>When I got married you slept with my sister.

202
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:55,620
<5-14,Chandler>这点很像007
<5-14,Chandler>That was pretty 007.

203
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,660
<6-2,Monica>真好  你来了  好  我想出办法了
<6-2,Monica>Okay, good, you're here. All right, I figured it out.

204
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,060
<6-2,Monica>我把这两桌的8个人  加上你父母...
<6-2,Monica>I'm gonna take 2 tables of 8, add your parents...

205
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,760
<6-2,Monica>变成3桌6个人
<6-2,Monica>...and make them into 3 tables of 6.

206
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,570
<6-2,Monica>我已经通知了宴会承包方  都搞定了
<6-2,Monica>And I called the caterer. I added two extra meals, we are good to go!

207
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:14,060
<6-3,Joey>他们不来了
<6-3,Joey>Yeah. They're not coming.

208
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:17,680
<6-4,Monica>什么
<6-4,Monica>What?

209
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,760
<6-5,Joey>他们觉得你是因为我才邀请他们的
<6-5,Joey>Somehow, they got the idea that you only invited them because of me.

210
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,120
<6-5,Joey>他们觉得自己不受欢迎
<6-5,Joey>They feel a little unwanted.

211
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,590
<6-6,Monica>太糟糕了  虽然话是没错  但太糟糕了
<6-6,Monica>That's too bad. It's true. But too bad.

212
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:29,550
<6-7,Joey>你可以打电话给我妈
<6-7,Joey>Look, Mon. If you could just call my mom.

213
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,410
<12-7,Chandler>-乔伊  -来嘛
<12-7,Chandler>- Joey. - Come on.

214
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:32,910
<6-8,Monica>告诉她你希望他们参加
<6-8,Monica>Just let her know you really want them to be there.

215
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,250
<6-9,Joey>别忘了  这些年来
<6-9,Joey>Let's not forget, this is a woman

216
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,720
<6-9,Joey>她可送过你不少千层面
<6-9,Joey>who has sent you many lasagnas over the years.

217
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,900
<6-10,Monica>没有啊
<6-10,Monica>No, she hasn't.

218
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:40,510
<6-11,Joey>有些没送到你手里又不是她的错
<6-11,Joey>Is it her fault if some didn't make it to you?

219
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,670
<6-12,Monica>我要说什么
<6-12,Monica>What am I gonna say?

220
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:45,730
<6-12,Monica>告诉她请贴搞乱了
<6-12,Monica>Tell them you mixed up invitations.

221
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:47,630
<6-13,Joey>不  怪邮局好了
<6-13,Joey>No, no, no, blame it on the post office.

222
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:51,210
<6-13,Joey>他们最恨邮局  还有爱尔兰人
<6-13,Joey>They hate the post office. And the Irish.

223
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,970
<6-13,Joey>不过你没理由怪到他们头上
<6-13,Joey>But I don't think you could blame it on them, so...

224
00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:00,400
<6-14,Monica>喂  你好  崔比安尼太太
<6-14,Monica>Hello? Yeah, hi. Mrs. Tribbiani?

<6-14,Monica>我们很多请贴都没寄到
<6-14,Monica>Apparently a bunch of the invitations that we sent weren't delivered.

229
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:15,090
<6-14,Monica>我猜又是可恶的邮局给搞丢了
<6-14,Monica>I guess there was some screw-up at the damn post office.

230
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,630
<6-14,Monica>就是嘛

<7-6,Phoebe>因为瑞吉娜·费兰吉死于酒精中毒
<7-6,Phoebe>...when Regina Phalangie died of alcohol poisoning.

243
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,990
<7-7,Melissa>真是糟糕  一个女孩就毁了整个姐妹会
<7-7,Melissa>Isn't it a shame when one girl ruins it for the whole bunch?

00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,680
<7-8,Rachel>不管了...
<7-8,Rachel>Anyway...

252
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,940
<7-12,Rachel>然后我们接吻了

<8-23,Monica>你要"即兴表演"
<8-23,Monica>You'll "vamp"?

286

<11-3,Rachel>不能让你随便就给抹杀了
<11-3,Rachel>I'm not gonna let you take it away from me.

355
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:20,400
<11-3,Rachel>你要是不记得那件事  你大概会记得这个
<11-3,Rachel>So if you don't remember that, maybe you'll remember this...

356
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:31,400
<11-4,Melissa>天啊  你爱我
<11-4,Melissa>Oh, my God. You love me.

357
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,060
<11-5,Rachel>什么
<11-5,Rachel>What?

358
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:38,090
<11-6,Melissa>我当然记得  这些日子里我一直惦记着
<11-6,Melissa>Of course I remember our kiss. I think about it all the time.

359
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:41,610
<11-6,Melissa>椰子壳的撞击声还在我耳畔萦绕
<11-6,Melissa>I can still hear the coconuts knocking together...

360
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,040
<11-6,Melissa>我不想告诉你
<11-6,Melissa>I just didn't want to tell you,

361
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:48,430
<11-6,Melissa>因为我觉得你不会回应我的爱
<11-6,Melissa>because I didn't think you'd return my love and now that you have...

362
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,660
<11-8,Melissa>看是谁突然变得害羞了
<11-8,Melissa>Look who's being suddenly shy.

363
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,120
<11-8,Melissa>你一定和我有相同的感觉
<11-8,Melissa>You can't tell me you don't feel what I feel.

364
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,380
<11-8,Melissa>如果不是真心  是不会吻得那么好
<11-8,Melissa>Nobody can kiss that good and not mean it.

365
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:05,490
<11-9,Rachel>我就是吻功很好而已
<11-9,Rachel>I'm just a good kisser.

366
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,540
<11-10,Melissa>闭嘴
<11-10,Melissa>Shut up.

367
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:11,040
<11-11,Rachel>对不起
<11-11,Rachel>I'm sorry.

368
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,900
<11-12,Melissa>你不必抱歉
<11-12,Melissa>You don't have to be sorry.

369
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:20,810
<11-12,Melissa>我显然是在开玩笑
<11-12,Melissa>I'm obviously kidding.

370
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,560
<11-12,Melissa>我没爱上你  我没爱上她
<11-12,Melissa>I'm not in love with you. I'm not in love with her.

371
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:28,140
<11-12,Melissa>我没听到椰子壳撞击的声音
<11-12,Melissa>I don't hear coconuts banging together.

372
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:33,860
<11-12,Melissa>我和男友做爱时没有幻想你的模样
<11-12,Melissa>I don't picture your face when I make love to my boyfriend.

373
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,160
<11-12,Melissa>我要走了
<11-12,Melissa>Anyway, I gotta go.

374
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,480
<11-12,Melissa>吻别吧
<11-12,Melissa>A kiss goodbye?

375
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:41,440
<11-12,Melissa>不要  好吧
<11-12,Melissa>No? Okay.

376
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,500
<11-13,Rachel>我不知道会发生...
<11-13,Rachel>I mean, I had no idea that that would...

377
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:03,740
<11-14,Rachel>你这是什么意思
<11-14,Rachel>What the hell was that?

378
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:06,120
<11-15,Phoebe>想看看那姑娘为什么那么纠结
<11-15,Phoebe>Just wanted to see what all the fuss was about.

379
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,840
<11-15,Phoebe>-然后呢  -我经历过更棒的
<11-15,Phoebe>- And? - I've had better.

380
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,170
<12-1,Chandler>我找到一件合身的
<12-1,Chandler>All right. I found one that fits.

381
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:23,180
<12-2,Rachel>是啊  人们常说第23次时常出现奇迹
<12-2,Rachel>Well, you know what they say? 23rd time's a charm.

382
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,980
<12-2,Rachel>看看你  好英俊
<12-2,Rachel>Look at you, all handsome.

383

<12-3,Chandler>-这是谁穿过的  -有什么关系吗
<12-3,Chandler>- Whose is it? - Does it matter?

384
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:35,110
<12-4,Rachel>最重要的是你看来很英俊
<12-4,Rachel>All that matters is that you look so handsome.

385
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,370
<12-3,Chandler>-是谁  -我不想说
<12-3,Chandler>- Whose is it? - I don't want to say.

386
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:45,250
