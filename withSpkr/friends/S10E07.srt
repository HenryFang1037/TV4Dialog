1
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:07,780
<1-3,Ross>嗨  你俩在干什么
<1-3,Ross>Hey, you guys. Hey, what are you doing?

2
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:09,560
<1-4,Mike>筹备婚礼
<1-4,Mike>Figuring out our wedding plans.

3
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,590
<1-5,Chandler>太巧了  我们也正合计这事呢
<1-5,Chandler>Funny. We were doing the same thing.

4
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:17,550
<1-6,Ross>疯了  场地  服装  食品
<1-6,Ross>It's really crazy. The hall, the dress, the food.

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,140
<1-7,Phoebe>没想到结个婚这么贵
<1-7,Phoebe>I had no idea how expensive this was.

6
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:21,400
<1-8,Chandler>是很贵
<1-8,Chandler>Yeah, it is really pricey.

7
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:23,290
<1-8,Chandler>第一次算出结婚费用  我被那个数字吓呆了
<1-8,Chandler>I freaked when I heard the numbers.

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,780
<1-9,Phoebe>结果你们怎么做的
<1-9,Phoebe>So, what did you two do about it?

9
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,160
<1-9,Phoebe>简单
<1-9,Phoebe>It was simple.

10
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:28,290
<1-10,Chandler>我想出了一些省钱方案
<1-10,Chandler>I came up with some cost-cutting solutions...

11
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:31,010
<1-10,Chandler>列了个清单  结果莫妮卡叫我去死
<1-10,Chandler>...wrote out a list, and Monica told me to go to hell.

12
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:33,830
<1-11,Ross>没钱好省的
<1-11,Ross>There's no way around it.

13
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,630
<1-11,Ross>只能接受现实  确实会花很多钱
<1-11,Ross>Just accept that this is gonna cost a lot of money.

14
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,140
<1-12,Mike>听说每年花在结婚上的钱高达400亿
<1-12,Mike>I heard that weddings are, like, a $40 billion-a-year industry.

15
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,990
<1-13,Ross>这其中我贡献过半
<1-13,Ross>Yeah. And I'm responsible for just, like, half of that.

16
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:48,820
<1-14,Phoebe>我觉得这钱应该用在更有意义的事上
<1-14,Phoebe>But really, it does seem like this money could be put to better use.

17
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,100
<1-15,Mike>当真
<1-15,Mike>Are you serious?

18
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,820
<1-16,Phoebe>把婚礼经费
<1-16,Phoebe>Yeah. How would you feel

19
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,570
<1-16,Phoebe>捐献给慈善事业
<1-16,Phoebe>if we gave all the wedding money to charity...

20
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,990
<1-16,Phoebe>我们就到市政厅登个记  如何
<1-16,Phoebe>...and we just got married at City Hall?

21
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,780
<1-17,Mike>这让我越发想娶你了
<1-17,Mike>I think it would make me wanna marry you even more.

22
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,560
<1-18,Ross>不得不说  你们的高姿态  很好
<1-18,Ross>I gotta say, you guys, that's an incredible gesture.

23
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:06,750
<1-19,Chandler>下次你结婚也这么干如何
<1-19,Chandler>Maybe you do that next time you get married.

24
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:12,360
<1-20,Ross>不不不  下次我要在夏威夷斜阳下结婚
<1-20,Ross>No, no, no. The next time's gonna be Hawaii at sunset.

25
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,110
<1-20,Ross>不过下下次可以听取你的意见
<1-20,Ross>But maybe the time after that.

37
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:58,580
<2-3,Joey>-嘿  忙啥呢  -嘿
<2-3,Joey>- Hey. What's going on? - Hey.

38
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,010
<2-4,Chandler>领养中心有人来家访
<2-4,Chandler>Our adoption social worker is coming,

39
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,590
<2-4,Chandler>所以我们在扫除
<2-4,Chandler>so we're cleaning the apartment.

40
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,650
<2-5,Monica>我们
<2-5,Monica>"We"?

41
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:06,860
<2-6,Chandler>你不想我掺和
<2-6,Chandler>You know you don't want me to help.

42
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:08,840
<2-6,Chandler>别现在又说这个
<2-6,Chandler>You can't have it both ways.

43
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:11,620
<2-7,Joey>这个人能决定
<2-7,Joey>Is this the person who decides

44
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,010
<2-7,Joey>你们是否收养一个孩子
<2-7,Joey>whether or not you get a baby?

45
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,700
<2-8,Chandler>差不多  这人来视察我们的生活环境
<2-8,Chandler>Kind of. She's coming by to interview us and see where we live.

46
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,070
<2-9,Monica>我们必须表现得完美
<2-9,Monica>And it has to go perfectly,

47
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,680
<2-9,Monica>若她对我们有丝毫不满
<2-9,Monica>because if she doesn't like something about us

48
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:19,760
<2-9,Monica>她就会让我们进不了
<2-9,Monica>she can keep us off

49
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,130
<2-9,Monica>全国任何一个领养的名单里
<2-9,Monica>every adoption list in the state.

50
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,510
<2-10,Joey>我可以过来友情协力一把
<2-10,Joey>Hey, maybe I should stop by.

51
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,040
<2-10,Joey>她没准爱看肥皂剧
<2-10,Joey>She could be a soap opera fan.

52
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:25,920
<2-10,Joey>小人物认识演艺名流
<2-10,Joey>It's very impressive

53
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:27,650
<2-10,Joey>可以蓬壁生辉呢
<2-10,Joey>when the little people know a celebrity.

54
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,520
<2-11,Chandler>小人物
<2-11,Chandler>"Little people"?

55
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:31,900
<2-12,Joey>名流
<2-12,Joey>"Celebrity."

56
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,240
<2-13,Monica>我觉得我做的差不多了
<2-13,Monica>So I think I'm just about done here.

57
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:38,300
<2-13,Monica>除非你还在哪
<2-13,Monica>Unless you have any bad stuff hidden somewhere,

58
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:40,410
<2-13,Monica>藏了像黄书  香烟什么的
<2-13,Monica>like porn or cigarettes?

59
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:41,810
<2-14,Chandler>什么
<2-14,Chandler>What?

60
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,730
<2-15,Monica>-才没有  -钱德勒
<2-15,Monica>- No. - Chandler.

61
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:49,800
<2-15,Monica>我没有
<2-15,Monica>I don't,

62
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:51,900
<2-16,Chandler>这样玷污人家清白太气人了
<2-16,Chandler>and I'm offended by the insinuation.

63
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:55,500
<2-17,Monica>沙发下没有杂志
<2-17,Monica>So there's not a magazine under the couch...

64
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,750
<2-17,Monica>厕所水箱后没有一包香烟
<2-17,Monica>...or cigarettes taped to the back of the toilet tank...

65
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,070
<2-17,Monica>录象机里没有A片
<2-17,Monica>...or a filthy video in the VCR?

66
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,150
<2-18,Chandler>香烟和杂志我认帐
<2-18,Chandler>I'll admit to the cigarettes and magazine.

67
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,880
<2-18,Chandler>但带子不是我的
<2-18,Chandler>But that tape is not mine.

68
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,520
<2-19,Monica>也不是我的
<2-19,Monica>It isn't mine.

69
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:09,340
<2-20,Joey>我想我们永远不会知道是谁的了
<2-20,Joey>I guess we'll never know whose it is.

70
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:18,920
<3-1,Charity guy>可以帮忙吗
<3-1,Charity guy>May I help you?

71
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:20,150
<3-2,Phoebe>我们来给孩子们
<3-2,Phoebe>Yes. We're here

72
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,830

<3-2,Phoebe>to make a rather sizable donation to the children.

73
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,540

<3-15,Mike>是啊  非常棒
<3-15,Mike>It does. It feels really good.

00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:18,360
<4-4,Rachel>替你难过

97
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:19,740
<4-4,Rachel>没事
<4-4,Rachel>That's okay.

98
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:23,040
<4-5,Ross>美貌的考古学家多的是
<4-5,Ross>I'm sure there are tons of other beautiful paleontologists out there.

00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:23,960
<4-6,Rachel>当然
<4-6,Rachel>Absolutely.

100
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:26,010
<4-7,Ross>只有一个  就是她
<4-7,Ross>There was one. She's it.

101
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:29,080
<4-7,Ross>其他的就好象是桥洞居民一样
<4-7,Ross>All the rest look like they should live under a bridge.

102
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,780
<4-8,Rachel>今天想怎么玩
<4-8,Rachel>So, what are you gonna do today?

103
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:36,140
<4-9,Ross>带艾玛去街心游乐场怎么样
<4-9,Ross>I was thinking of taking Emma to the playground.

104
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:38,130
<4-10,Rachel>天啊  什么
<4-10,Rachel>Oh, my God. What?

105
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:41,600
<4-11,Ross>我又没说
<4-11,Ross>Like I said, I was thinking of

106
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:44,910
<4-11,Ross>带她去武器弹药博物馆
<4-11,Ross>taking Emma to the Museum of Knives and Fire.

107
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,750
<4-12,Rachel>听着  罗斯
<4-12,Rachel>Okay, look, Ross.

108
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,670
<4-12,Rachel>我反对艾玛去游乐场
<4-12,Rachel>I do not want Emma going to the playground.

109
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,660
<4-13,Ross>因为
<4-13,Ross>Because...?

110
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:01,090
<4-14,Rachel>好吧  如果你想知道…
<4-14,Rachel>All right, if you must know, I had a traumatic...

111
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:04,600
<4-14,Rachel>我小时候荡秋千遇险
<4-14,Rachel>...swing incident when I was little.

112
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,230
<4-16,Rachel>-真的  -我才四岁
<4-16,Rachel>- Seriously? - Yes. I was 4 years old.

113
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,950
<4-16,Rachel>我荡秋千
<4-16,Rachel>And I was on the swing...

114
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,130
<4-16,Rachel>突然头发缠到铁链上
<4-16,Rachel>...and then all of a sudden my hair got tangled in the chain.

115
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:16,680
<4-16,Rachel>结果老妈剪掉我一大缕头发
<4-16,Rachel>And to get me out,

116
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:19,820
<4-16,Rachel>才救我出来
<4-16,Rachel>my mom had to cut a big chunk of my hair.

117
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,400
<4-16,Rachel>结果有好几星期头发才长齐
<4-16,Rachel>And it was uneven for weeks.

118
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:32,900
<4-17,Ross>你竟熬了过来
<4-17,Ross>And you made it through that?

119
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,610
<4-17,Ross>简直可以拍成电影
<4-17,Ross>I wonder who's gonna play you in the movie.

120
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:40,970
<4-18,Rachel>你尽管拿我取笑
<4-18,Rachel>Okay, fine, you can make fun of me.

121
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,120
<4-18,Rachel>反正我就是不想艾玛去
<4-18,Rachel>I do not want Emma going there.

123
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,640
<4-18,Rachel>我在想能不能让克莱尔·丹妮丝扮演我
<4-18,Rachel>And I was thinking Claire Danes.

124
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,670
<4-19,Ross>你的悲剧令我同情
<4-19,Ross>Look, I'm sorry to hear about your tragedy.

125
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,920
<4-19,Ross>不过秋千很安全
<4-19,Ross>But the swings are perfectly safe.

126
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:53,420
<4-19,Ross>而且艾玛喜欢荡秋千
<4-19,Ross>And besides, Emma loves them.

127
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:55,420
<4-19,Ross>我们同去  你就知道了
<4-19,Ross>You should come, and you'll see.

128
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:58,230
<4-20,Rachel>秋千速度高达40英里/小时
<4-20,Rachel>Those things go, like, 40 miles an hour.

129
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:00,480
<4-20,Rachel>当你荡到最高处
<4-20,Rachel>And there's that moment when you're at the top...

130
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:04,860
<4-20,Rachel>鬼才知道会不会返回地球
<4-20,Rachel>...when you just don't know if you're gonna return back to Earth.

131
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:09,600
<4-21,Ross>宇宙充满小孩子绕轨道运行

224
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:19,560
<7-6,Phoebe>我们本来不想大办
<7-6,Phoebe>we thought we didn't want.

225
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,060
<7-6,Phoebe>但现在我们改变了主意
<7-6,Phoebe>But it turns out we do.

00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,010
<7-10,Charity guy>不关我事
<7-10,Charity guy>Hey, it's none of my business.

233
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,250
<7-10,Charity guy>也许这是件好事
<7-10,Charity guy>Besides, this is probably a good thing.

234
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,910
<7-10,Charity guy>别把孩子惯坏了
<7-10,Charity guy>We've really been spoiling the children,

<7-11,Phoebe>尤其对于我来说
<7-11,Phoebe>And especially to me.

239
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:54,040
<7-11,Phoebe>我没参加过毕业典礼
<7-11,Phoebe>I didn't have a graduation party.

240
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,520
<7-11,Phoebe>没有毕业舞会
<7-11,Phoebe>And I didn't go to prom.

241
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:59,580
<7-11,Phoebe>在我的16岁生日的时候
<7-11,Phoebe>And I spent my sweet 16 being chased around a tire yard...

242
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,960
<7-11,Phoebe>我被精神病人在一个废旧轮胎场地狂追
<7-11,Phoebe>...by an escaped mental patient

243
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:03,350
<7-11,Phoebe>他还说
<7-11,Phoebe>who, in his own words, wanted to:

244
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,910
<7-11,Phoebe>杀我什么的
<7-11,Phoebe>"Kill me, or whatever."

245
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,720
<7-11,Phoebe>我应当有个隆重的婚礼
<7-11,Phoebe>So I deserve a real celebration.

246
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:12,660
<7-11,Phoebe>我不会让你个流汗男
<7-11,Phoebe>And I'm not gonna let some sweaty little man

00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:14,510
<7-11,Phoebe>弄的我觉得内疚
<7-11,Phoebe>make me feel badly about it.

248
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,810
<7-12,Mike>她也有可能是在说我
<7-12,Mike>She could've been talking about either one of us.

00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:35,790
<8-2,Monica>-请进  -谢谢
<8-2,Monica>- Please come in. - Thank you.

253
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,300
<8-4,Monica>请进  喝点什么
<8-4,Monica>Would you like something to drink?

254
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:38,560
<8-5,Laura>喝水可以了
<8-5,Laura>Water would be fine.

255
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:41,280
<8-6,Monica>你总算来了
<8-6,Monica>We're so glad that you're here.

256
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,440
<8-6,Monica>我们好兴奋  终于开始领养小孩的流程了
<8-6,Monica>We're excited about getting this process started.

257
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:46,990
<8-7,Chandler>因为我们爱小孩  爱得要死
<8-7,Chandler>Because we love kids. Love them to death.

258
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,520
<8-7,Chandler>不是真的要孩子"死"
<8-7,Chandler>Well, not actually to death.

259
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:51,160
<8-7,Chandler>只是这么形容一下
<8-7,Chandler>That's just a figure of speech.

260
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,250
<8-7,Chandler>我们爱孩子  恰当合理
<8-7,Chandler>We love kids the appropriate amount...

261
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,910
<8-7,Chandler>符合法律法规
<8-7,Chandler>...as allowed by law.

262
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,640
<8-8,Laura>-你们家好可爱  -谢谢
<8-8,Laura>- Your place is just lovely. - Thank you.

263
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:04,360
<8-9,Monica>这栋楼的确看起来很卫生
<8-9,Monica>Yes, this building does have a wholesome,

264
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,600
<8-9,Monica>给人家的感觉
<8-9,Monica>family feel to it.

265
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:08,260
<8-10,Laura>我好像来过这里
<8-10,Laura>I feel like I've been here before.

266
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,360
<8-10,Laura>这里还有谁家在申请领养吗
<8-10,Laura>Any other couples in the building adopting?

267
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:12,190
<8-11,Monica>是不是一楼那家
<8-11,Monica>Is that that couple on the first floor?

268
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,450
<8-11,Monica>我们应该比他们先得到孩子
<8-11,Monica>Because we should get a baby before them.

269
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,990
<8-11,Monica>他还想卖毒品给我
<8-11,Monica>That guy tried to sell me drugs.

270
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:19,830
<8-12,Chandler>但其他人都好
<8-12,Chandler>But other than that,

271
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:21,510
<8-12,Chandler>这是栋干净卫生的楼
<8-12,Chandler>wholesome, wholesome building.

272
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:25,150
<8-14,Chandler>怎么
<8-14,Chandler>What?

273
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:28,000
<8-15,Laura>我想起来了为什么我对这楼有记忆了
<8-15,Laura>I realized why I remember this place.

274
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:29,200
<8-16,Monica>真的  怎么回事
<8-16,Monica>Really? What is it?

275
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,230
<8-17,Laura>哦  没什么
<8-17,Laura>Oh, it's nothing.

276
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,060
<8-17,Laura>我和住在这栋楼里的一个男人约会
<8-17,Laura>I went on a date with a guy who lived in this building.

277
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,140
<8-17,Laura>结果无疾而终
<8-17,Laura>It didn't end very well.

278
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,890
<8-18,Monica>那人该不是叫乔伊·崔比安尼吧
<8-18,Monica>That wouldn't, by any chance, be Joey Tribbiani?

279
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:40,550
<8-20,Chandler>-就是他  -当然是他
<8-20,Chandler>- Yes! - Of course it was.

280
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:43,390
<8-21,Laura>良宵过后
<8-21,Laura>We had a great night.

281
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:44,940
<8-21,Laura>他说他再打电话给我
<8-21,Laura>In the morning, he promised he'd call

282
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,020
<8-21,Laura>结果再没联络
<8-21,Laura>and he didn't.

283
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,890
<8-22,Chandler>真他妈混蛋
<8-22,Chandler>Rat bastard!

284
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:50,770
<8-23,Laura>你们该不是他朋友
<8-23,Laura>So you're not friends with him?

285
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:51,700
<8-24,Monica and Chandler>当然不是  不
<8-24,Monica and Chandler>Oh, God, no.

286
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,910
<8-24,Monica and Chandler>当然不是  不
<8-24,Monica and Chandler>No, no, no.

287
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:54,440
<8-24,Monica and Chandler>当然不是
<8-24,Monica and Chandler>No. Nope.

288
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,300
<8-24,Monica and Chandler>不...
<8-24,Monica and Chandler>No...

289
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:55,980
<8-24,Monica and Chandler>不...
<8-24,Monica and Chandler>No...

290
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:56,720
<8-24,Monica and Chandler>不...
<8-24,Monica and Chandler>No...

291
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,350
<8-24,Monica and Chandler>不...
<8-24,Monica and Chandler>No...

292
00:12:58,940 --> 00:12:59,570
<8-24,Monica and Chandler>不...
<8-24,Monica and Chandler>No...

293
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,440
<8-25,Laura>抱歉提到这事
<8-25,Laura>Well, I'm sorry I brought it up.

294
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,810
<8-25,Laura>那么你们当中有人打算待在家里吗
<8-25,Laura>So are either one of you planning on staying at home?

295
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:12,380
<8-26,Joey>有人吗  名人驾到
<8-26,Joey>Hello? Anybody in there order a celebrity?

296
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,570
<8-27,Laura>怎么了
<8-27,Laura>What was that?

297
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:20,560
<8-28,Chandler>过道上乱跑的疯子
<8-28,Chandler>That's just some crazy guy who roams the halls here.

298
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:23,350
<8-28,Chandler>不过他对小孩很慈祥
<8-28,Chandler>He's great with kids, though.

299
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,780
<9-1,Rachel>罗斯  天啊  你还好
<9-1,Rachel>Ross. Oh, my God, are you okay?

300
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:34,400
<9-2,Ross>他妹的
<9-2,Ross>Son of a bitch!

301
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:41,230
<9-2,Ross>别紧张  我又没说F打头那个字
<9-2,Ross>Oh, relax. I didn't say the F-word.

302
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,150
<9-3,Rachel>罗斯  看吧
<9-3,Rachel>Ross, see,

303
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:46,510
<9-3,Rachel>早告诉你了  秋千太邪恶了
<9-3,Rachel>I told you! Those swings are evil!

304
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,830
<9-3,Rachel>就这一次了
<9-3,Rachel>That is it.

305
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,410
<9-3,Rachel>这辈子再也不许
<9-3,Rachel>That's the last time Emma is getting on

306
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,270
<9-3,Rachel>艾玛接近它
<9-3,Rachel>one of those things for her entire life.

307
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:54,010
<9-4,Ross>别这样  不是秋千的错
<9-4,Ross>No, no, no. Okay, it wasn't the swing's fault.

308
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,330
<9-4,Ross>是我错
<9-4,Ross>It was my fault.

309
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,670
<9-4,Ross>还有那孩子的错
<9-4,Ross>And kind of that kid's fault.

310
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:01,360
<9-4,Ross>他还笑呢  算你恨
<9-4,Ross>Who is still laughing. Nice.

311
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,750
<9-5,Rachel>在再有人受伤之前
<9-5,Rachel>Come on. Can we just get out of here

312
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,300
<9-5,Rachel>我们走吧
<9-5,Rachel>before somebody else gets hurt?

313
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:07,280
<9-6,Ross>不  等等  这样吧
<9-6,Ross>No. Wait. Ok, ok. I have an idea.

314
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:08,920
<9-6,Ross>你去荡秋千
<9-6,Ross>I want you to get on the swing...

315
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:12,360
<9-6,Ross>你会发现没什么好担心的
<9-6,Ross>...and you'll see that there's nothing to be afraid of.

316
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:16,820
<9-7,Rachel>我知道你意欲何为了
<9-7,Rachel>I know what this is all about.

317
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:20,140
<9-7,Rachel>你一贯嫉妒我满头秀发
<9-7,Rachel>You've always been jealous of my hair.

318
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,600
<9-8,Ross>这只是想你已经成年了
<9-8,Ross>I just think you're an adult, okay?

319
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:25,740
<9-8,Ross>该克服那些愚蠢的恐惧了
<9-8,Ross>And you should get over your silly fears.

320
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,780
<9-9,Rachel>好  上就上
<9-9,Rachel>All right, fine. I'll do it.

321
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:28,430
<9-10,Ross>好
<9-10,Ross>Good.

322
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,510
<9-11,Rachel>如果你敢抓蜘蛛
<9-11,Rachel>If you hold a spider.

323
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,900
<9-12,Ross>在哪儿  在哪儿
<9-12,Ross>Where?! Where?!

324
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,330
<9-11,Rachel>我说"如果"你敢抓蜘蛛
<9-11,Rachel>If you hold a spider.

325
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:35,830
<9-14,Ross>我听见了
<9-14,Ross>I know.

326
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,060
<10-1,Joey>伙计们  没事吧
<10-1,Joey>Guys, is everything okay?

330
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:56,240
<10-4,Chandler>就是那个叫波特疯子
<10-4,Chandler>Oh, it's just like I said, that crazy...

331
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:59,630
<10-4,Chandler>在过道上跑
<10-4,Chandler>...Bert, roaming the halls.

332
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,330
<10-5,Joey>伙计们
<10-5,Joey>Guys?

333
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,860
<10-6,Monica>接着跑吧  波特
<10-6,Monica>Keep on roaming, Bert!

334
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:06,840
<10-6,Monica>今天我们不看你疯了
<10-6,Monica>We don't want any crazy today!

335
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:08,280
<10-7,Joey>到底怎么了
<10-7,Joey>What's going on?

336
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,850
<10-8,Chandler>我们等会再说  波特  一切都好
<10-8,Chandler>We'll talk later! Bert. Everything's fine!

337
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,940
<11-1,Joey>听起来就是有问题
<11-1,Joey>Everything doesn't sound fine.

338
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,590
<11-2,Laura>他独自一个在外面  不会出事吧
<11-2,Laura>Is he all right out there by himself?

339
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:18,040
<11-3,Chandler>没事  他有监管人
<11-3,Chandler>Oh, yeah. He has a caretaker.

340
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,360
<11-3,Chandler>是他哥
<11-3,Chandler>His older brother...

341
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:21,940
<11-4,Laura>叫欧尼
<11-4,Laura>...Ernie.

342
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,760
<11-4,Laura>波特和欧尼
<11-4,Laura>Bert and Ernie?

344
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,160
<11-5,Chandler>无巧不成书
<11-5,Chandler>You can't make this stuff up.

345
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,480
<12-1,Mike>你没说过你16岁生日时
<12-1,Mike>You never told me about that guy

346
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,990
<12-1,Mike>被男人追杀的故事
<12-1,Mike>and your sweet 16.

347
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:34,520
<12-1,Mike>真可怜
<12-1,Mike>I'm sorry about that.

348
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,060
<12-2,Phoebe>结局还算好
<12-2,Phoebe>Oh, it ended okay.

349
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,910
<12-2,Phoebe>我朋友毙了他
<12-2,Phoebe>One of my friends shot him.

350
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:42,460
<12-3,Mike>至少你会有个体面婚礼
<12-3,Mike>At least you'll get a proper wedding.

351
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,450
<12-3,Mike>你该得的
<12-3,Mike>You really deserve that.

352
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:44,910
<12-4,Phoebe>是的  没错
<12-4,Phoebe>Yeah, I really do.

353
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:47,110
<12-4,Phoebe>知道吗  长这么大我还没风光过
<12-4,Phoebe>You know, I had nothing growing up.

354
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:52,310
<12-4,Phoebe>就像被我剥夺金钱的那些孩子一样
<12-4,Phoebe>Just like the kids I took the money from.

355
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:55,360
<12-5,Mike>不...  看出你苗头了
<12-5,Mike>No... I see where this is going.

356
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,320
<12-5,Mike>别又想让我退回去
<12-5,Mike>Don't make me go back there.

357
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:01,340
<12-6,Phoebe>我不能用这钱办婚事
<12-6,Phoebe>Look, I can't have a wedding with this money now.

358
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:02,590
<12-6,Phoebe>这样就有污点了
<12-6,Phoebe>It's tainted.

359
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,530
<12-7,Mike>好吧  退回就是了
<12-7,Mike>Fine, we'll give the money back.

360
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,800
<12-8,Phoebe>如果慈善捐助处那家伙
<12-8,Phoebe>If that guy at the charity

361
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:08,010
<12-8,Phoebe>又叫咱们难看
<12-8,Phoebe>gives us a hard time...

362
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:11,210
<12-8,Phoebe>我朋友的老枪好久没见过血了
<12-8,Phoebe>...my friend hasn't shot anyone in a really long time.

363
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,950
<13-1,Laura>我想说  这种环境
<13-1,Laura>I must say this seems like

364
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,800
<13-1,Laura>培养小孩似乎很理想
<13-1,Laura>a lovely environment to raise a child in.

365
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:19,080
<13-2,Monica>你尽可以在各种家具
<13-2,Monica>You are welcome to look under

367
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,130

<13-2,Monica>...because, believe me,

368
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,540
<13-2,Monica>绝无黄书和香烟什么的
<13-2,Monica>you won't find any porn or cigarettes under there.

369
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:26,150
<13-3,Laura>在到处看看之前
<13-3,Laura>Before we look around,

370
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,520
<13-3,Laura>让我先检查下我的表
<13-3,Laura>let me make sure

371
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,560
<13-3,Laura>是不是都填好了
<13-3,Laura>I have everything I need up to here.

372
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:37,030
<13-4,Monica>我带你去看看婴儿房
<13-4,Monica>Why don't I show you the baby's room.

373
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:43,620
<13-5,Chandler>你干啥
<13-5,Chandler>What are you doing?

374
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,620
<13-6,Joey>你不让我进来
<13-6,Joey>You wouldn't let me in.

375
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,860
<13-6,Joey>我以为你们出事了
<13-6,Joey>I thought you were in trouble.

376
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:46,740
<13-7,Chandler>才没有
<13-7,Chandler>Well, we're not.

377
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:48,110
<13-8,Joey>但你叫我"波特"
<13-8,Joey>But you called me "Bert."

378
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:51,630
<13-8,Joey>那是"危险"的暗号
<13-8,Joey>That's our code word for danger.

379
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,940
<13-9,Chandler>我们没约定过什么暗号
<13-9,Chandler>We don't have a code word.

380
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:55,680
<13-9,Chandler>没有吗
<13-9,Chandler>We don't?

381
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:58,250
<13-10,Joey>应该约一个
<13-10,Joey>We really should.

382
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,690
<13-10,Joey>从今往后
<13-10,Joey>From now on,

383
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:02,220
<13-10,Joey>"波特"就用来作为遇到危险的暗号
<13-10,Joey>"Bert" will be our code word for danger.

384
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,220
<13-11,Monica>参观完婴儿房
<13-11,Monica>So that was the baby's room.

385
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,820
<13-12,Monica>下面参观哪里
<13-12,Monica>What room should we see next?

386
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:11,120
<13-13,Chandler>除了沙发后面都可以参观
<13-13,Chandler>Any room that isn't behind this couch.

387
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:15,010
<13-14,Monica>有些人不懂他的笑话
<13-14,Monica>Some people don't get him,

388
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,780
<13-14,Monica>但我觉得他真幽默
<13-14,Monica>but I think he's really funny.

389
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:26,390
<13-15,Joey>我不在乎被你粗暴对待
<13-15,Joey>I did not care for that.

390
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,280
<13-16,Chandler>你得回避
<13-16,Chandler>You have to leave.

391
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:31,030
<13-16,Chandler>你和这个社工睡过
<13-16,Chandler>You slept with our social worker

392
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,210
<13-16,Chandler>再没联络她
<13-16,Chandler>and never called her back.

393
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,330
<13-16,Chandler>她还在生你的气
<13-16,Chandler>She is still pissed,

394
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,370
<13-16,Chandler>不能让她见到你
<13-16,Chandler>so she can't see you.

395
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,900
<13-19,Chandler>好  好
<13-19,Chandler>Okay, okay.

<13-22,Chandler>我们不想和你做朋友
<13-22,Chandler>we do not want to be friends with you!

400
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,360
<13-22,Chandler>也不想买你的球棒
<13-22,Chandler>And we don't wanna buy your bat!

401
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:59,320
<13-23,Laura>你来这儿干什么

<13-27,Joey>真不敢相信你竟从来没给我打过电话
<13-27,Joey>I can't believe you never called me.

<13-29,Joey>告诉你  我叫乔伊
