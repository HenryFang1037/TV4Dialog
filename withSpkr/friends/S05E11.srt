<2-7,Chandler>新年愿望是坠机身亡的人
<2-7,Chandler>who's resolution is to plummet to their deaths.

65
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:50,390
<2-8,Phoebe>也许你的愿望应该是不取笑朋友
<2-8,Phoebe>Maybe your resolution should be not make fun of your friends,

66
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,120
<2-8,Phoebe>尤其是很快会免费
<2-8,Phoebe>especially the ones who may soon

<2-8,Phoebe>用自己的飞机载你去欧洲的人
<2-8,Phoebe>be flying you to Europe for free on their own plane.

75
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,560

90
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:59,880
<2-21,Monica>瑞秋  或许你的愿望应该是别那么八卦
<2-21,Monica>Hey Rach, maybe your resolution should be to umm, gossip less.

00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:01,420
<2-22,Rachel>什么  我哪有八卦
<2-22,Rachel>What? I don't gossip!

92
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,820
<2-23,Rachel>或许我偶尔会发现一些事
<2-23,Rachel>Well, maybe sometimes I find out things

93
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:10,570
<2-23,Rachel>或听到一些事  然后转述出去
<2-23,Rachel>or I hear something and I pass that information on

94
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:15,030
<2-23,Rachel>这就像一种公共服务  并不代表我很八卦
<2-23,Rachel>y'know kinda like a public service, it doesn't mean I'm a gossip.

00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,030
<2-23,Rachel>你们会说新闻主播八卦吗
<2-23,Rachel>I mean, would you call Ted Kopel a gossip?

<4-20,Chandler>罗斯这种人通常不穿这种裤子
<4-20,Chandler>See, people like Ross don't generally wear these types of pants.

153
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:00,200
<4-20,Chandler>这种裤子很紧
<4-20,Chandler>You see, they're very tight.

159
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:17,350
