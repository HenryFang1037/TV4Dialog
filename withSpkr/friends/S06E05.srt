13
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,240
<1-10,Ross>好吧  还是不要想好了
<1-10,Ross>Okay, maybe it's best not to think about it.

00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,060
<1-11,Phoebe>这真是不可原谅
<1-11,Phoebe>Okay, his is inexcusable.

110
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:03,360
<5-5,Phoebe>不行  我们各自负责自己的宝宝

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,900
<5-6,Chandler>瞧  你这么说就不对了
<5-6,Chandler>See? That's where you're wrong.

112
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,610
<5-6,Chandler>我们不应该一对一地防守这些娃娃
<5-6,Chandler>We've been playing the babies man-to-man.

113
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:09,640
<5-6,Chandler>我们应该尝试区域联防
<5-6,Chandler>We should really be playing a zone defense.

114
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:13,050
<5-7,Monica>-什么意思  -如果我们各自负责一个区域
<5-7,Monica>- What do you mean? - I just think things'll go a lot smoother

115
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:14,300
<5-8,Chandler>事情会顺利很多
<5-8,Chandler>if we each have a zone, you know.

116
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,580
<5-9,Phoebe>菲比  你可以负责给他们擦洗
<5-9,Phoebe>Phoebe, be in charge of wiping.

119
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,290
<5-8,Chandler>他们那可爱的小模样
<5-8,Chandler>when they put their hands....

120
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,010
<5-8,Chandler>听起来不错
<5-8,Chandler>That sounds great,

121
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:28,740
<5-9,Phoebe>但怎么不是你负责给他们擦洗
<5-9,Phoebe>but you should be in charge of wiping.

122
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,680
<5-10,Chandler>我是个新手
<5-10,Chandler>Okay, l'm a rookie.

123
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,580
<5-10,Chandler>难以承担如此大任
<5-10,Chandler>l should not be in the end zone.

124
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,800
<5-11,Monica>这太有意思了
<5-11,Monica>This is so great.

<5-12,Phoebe>是吗   可这不是我点的菜啊
<5-12,Phoebe>Yeah? Well, this is not what l ordered.

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,770
<7-7,Chandler>他们才不会误食什么
<7-7,Chandler>They are not gonna swallow anything.

185
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:28,630
<7-7,Chandler>你们也太保护过度了吧
<7-7,Chandler>You guys are being way too overprotective.

186
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,000
<7-7,Chandler>我小时候  我妈都把我
<7-7,Chandler>When l was a kid, my mom used to

187
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,740

<7-11,Monica>好可爱喔
<7-11,Monica>Oh, it's so cute.

191
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:43,750
<7-11,Monica>我好奇你是从几岁之后
<7-11,Monica>I wonder what age it is when you stop

192
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,990
<7-11,Monica>才不能把腿举到头上的
<7-11,Monica>being able to both legs behind your head.

193
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,640
<7-12,Phoebe>我现在还可以

00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,230
<7-14,Chandler>我想或许你们说得对
<7-14,Chandler>l thought about it and maybe you're right.

197
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:58,050
<7-14,Chandler>克罗格可能不是个安全的玩具
<7-14,Chandler>Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.

198
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:59,430
<7-15,Monica>知道就好  你为什么改口了
<7-15,Monica>Good. What made you change your mind?

199
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:01,680
<7-16,Chandler>我吞了他的音速爆破枪
<7-16,Chandler>l swallowed his sonic blaster gun.

200
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,680
<7-17,Phoebe>怎么会这样
<7-17,Phoebe>How did that happen?

201
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,210
<7-18,Chandler>我想证明我是对的
<7-18,Chandler>l was trying to prove that l was right, you know.

202
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,850
<7-18,Chandler>结果证实我错了
<7-18,Chandler>And it turns out l was wrong...

203
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,220
<7-18,Chandler>现在它卡在我的喉咙了
<7-18,Chandler>...and now it's lodged in my throat.

204
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:18,270
<7-19,Monica>糟糕  我们这两小时
<7-19,Monica>Damn it! Y'know this whole time

206
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,420
<7-19,Monica>都忘了要照看大孩钱德勒了
<7-19,Monica>...and no one was watching Chandler!

207
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:28,050
<8-1,Judge>两位要申请注销婚姻  是吗
<8-1,Judge>Okay, you are asking the court for an annulment?

208
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:31,380
<8-2,Rachel>是的  法官大人  申请表都填好了
<8-2,Rachel>Yes, Your Honor. Here are our forms, all filled out.

209
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,570
<8-3,Judge>根据申请书所言
<8-3,Judge>So based on your petition...

210
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:36,610
<8-3,Judge>你申请注销的理由是
<8-3,Judge>...you are seeking an annulment on the grounds...

211
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:39,780
<8-3,Judge>"盖勒先生的精神状况不稳定"
<8-3,Judge>...that "Mr. Geller is mentally unstable."

212
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:45,120
<8-4,Ross>是  我精神状况不稳定
<8-4,Ross>Fine. l'm mentally unstable.

213
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,100
<8-5,Judge>另外一个理由是
<8-5,Judge>And based on the fact that

214
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,090
<8-5,Judge>"盖勒先生使用静脉注射毒品"
<8-5,Judge>"Mr. Geller is an intravenous drug user."

215
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:54,000
<8-7,Rachel>-什么  -是的  海洛因与可卡因
<8-7,Rachel>- What? - Yes. Heroin and crack.

217
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:58,440
<8-8,Ross>可卡因根本不是静脉注射毒品
<8-8,Ross>Crack isn't even an intravenous drug.

218
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,260
<8-9,Rachel>你当然懂啊
<8-9,Rachel>Well, you would know.

219
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:04,710
<8-10,Judge>这上面还说
<8-10,Judge>Now, it also says here that you...

220
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:07,910
<8-10,Judge>"你在婚前隐瞒性取向"
<8-10,Judge>..."lied about your sexual preference before marriage."

221
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:08,820
<8-11,Ross>拜托
<8-11,Ross>Oh, come on.

222
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:11,790
<8-12,Rachel>罗斯  我都发现那些杂志了
<8-12,Rachel>Ross, please. l found the magazines.

223
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:16,820
<8-13,Judge>还有你"无法履行夫妻间的义务"
<8-13,Judge>And finally, that you were "unable to consummate the marriage."

224
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,760
<8-13,Judge>这也难怪  你既是同性恋
<8-13,Judge>Well, that makes sense since you're gay

225
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,590
<8-13,Judge>又是瘾君子
<8-13,Judge>and addicted to heroin.

226
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,070
<8-14,Ross>够了  抱歉  这太夸张了
<8-14,Ross>Okay, you know, l'm sorry, this is insane.

227
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:26,980
<8-14,Ross>我既不是瘾君子
<8-14,Ross>l'm not addicted to heroin,

228
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:29,360
<8-14,Ross>也不是同性恋  而且...
<8-14,Ross>l'm not gay and there is no problem...

229
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,540
<8-14,Ross>我绝对有能力履行任何"事情"
<8-14,Ross>...with my ability to consummate anything.

230
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:34,950
<8-14,Ross>我此时此刻就能履行夫妻间的义务
<8-14,Ross>l'll consummate this marriage right here, right now!

231
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,740
<8-15,Judge>没有这个必要
<8-15,Judge>That won't be necessary.

232
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:39,870
<8-16,Ross>我们交往时
<8-16,Ross>And when we were dating,

233
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:42,130
<8-16,Ross>简直就像干柴遇上烈火
<8-16,Ross>we consummated like bunnies.

234
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:45,850
<8-17,Rachel>如果你们曾经认真交往过
<8-17,Rachel>Now if you two were involved in a serious relationship,

235
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:48,140
<8-18,Judge>-这事就不好办了  -罗斯  法官大人
<8-18,Judge>- that really creates a problem. - Ross! Your honor,

236
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:51,320
<8-19,Rachel>请放心  我们两年前就分手了
<8-19,Rachel>Rest assured, that relationship ended two years ago.

237
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:54,870
<8-19,Rachel>可以删掉"干柴遇上烈火"那句吗
<8-19,Rachel>And could you strike "consummated like bunnies" from the record.

238
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,030
<8-20,Judge>这份申请书有任何真话吗
<8-20,Judge>ls there anything in this record that is actually true?

239
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,130
<8-21,Rachel>有  我们确实是在拉斯维加斯结的婚
<8-21,Rachel>Well, yes. We got married in Vegas.

240
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:05,240
<8-21,Rachel>名字应该也没错
<8-21,Rachel>And the names, l think.

241
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,660
<8-22,Judge>从刚才的话听来
<8-22,Judge>Well, based on what l've heard,

242
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,740
<8-22,Judge>你们两位不符合注销资格
<8-22,Judge>you two certainly don't qualify for an annulment.

243
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:11,810
<8-22,Judge>如果你们不想在一起
<8-22,Judge>lf you don't wanna be together,

244
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:13,810
<8-22,Judge>就必须办理离婚手续
<8-22,Judge>you'll have to file for divorce.

245
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:15,440
<8-23,Ross>太好了  你现在高兴了吗

248
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:22,920
<8-24,Rachel>那你那句"干柴遇上烈火"就没有错吗
<8-24,Rachel>What about you and your "consummated like bunnies" nonsense?

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,030
<8-25,Ross>那...  你在打什么呢
<8-25,Ross>What are you typing that for?

250
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:28,610
<8-25,Ross>她说我们不能办注销了
<8-25,Ross>She said we don't get the annulment.

<8-26,Rachel>看见了吧  你居然还不让我跟他离婚
<8-26,Rachel>Okay, do you see what you're keeping me married to?

256
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:44,520
<8-27,Judge>请两位离开我的办公室
<8-27,Judge>You need to get out of my chambers.

<8-28,Rachel>没办成我绝对不走
<8-28,Rachel>and l'm not leaving here until l get one!

260
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:52,100
<8-30,Judge>你们想在牢里过夜吗
<8-30,Judge>Would you like a night in jail?

261
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,940
<8-31,Rachel>耽误您了
<8-31,Rachel>Thank you for your time.

262
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,680
<9-1,Joey>保时捷的主人把车开走了
<9-1,Joey>That Porsche guy took his car back.

263
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,210
<9-2,Chandler>但你捡到了他的衣橱钥匙吗
<9-2,Chandler>But you found the keys to his clothes?

264
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,970
<9-3,Joey>不是  我只是喜欢
<9-3,Joey>No, l just love the way it feels

265
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:30,500
<9-3,Joey>大家误以为我有保时捷的感觉
<9-3,Joey>when everybody thinks l own a Porsche.

266
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,720
<9-4,Monica>别人会因为你穿着这样
<9-4,Monica>And people will think you own a Porsche

267
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,740
<9-4,Monica>-而觉得你有保时捷吗  -当然会啦
<9-4,Monica>- because you're wearing the clothes? - Of Course!

268
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:38,350
<9-5,Joey>只有白痴才会没车  还穿成这样
<9-5,Joey>Only an idiot would wear this stuff if he didn't have the car.

269
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,720
<9-6,Chandler>那倒是
<9-6,Chandler>That is true.

270
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:48,400
<9-7,Phoebe>不过只有天才才会误食音速爆破枪
<9-7,Phoebe>Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.

271
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:50,620
<9-8,Joey>我也误食过
<9-8,Joey>Oh, l've been there.

272
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:55,830
<9-8,Joey>我要去开我的保时捷了
<9-8,Joey>l am gonna go drive my Porsche.

273
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:58,510
<9-9,Monica>乔伊  你知道你没有保时捷吧
<9-9,Monica>Joey, you know you don't actually have one.

274
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:00,780
<9-10,Joey>你干嘛戳穿我  我正在入戏呢
<9-10,Joey>Come on, what are you doing? l'm in character.

275
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,460
<9-10,Joey>你说说她  好吗
<9-10,Joey>Will you talk to her?

276
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,660
<9-11,Chandler>我觉得那玩意儿换位置了  疼死我了
<9-11,Chandler>l think it just moved. lt's poking me.

277
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,740
<9-12,Monica>好吧  够了  我们去挂急诊吧
<9-12,Monica>All right, that's it, we're going to the emergency room.

278
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:11,290
<9-13,Phoebe>不  你不能把宝宝都留给我一个人照顾
<9-13,Phoebe>No, you can't leave me here with them.

279
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:12,440
<9-13,Phoebe>我们正在带孩子呢
<9-13,Phoebe>We're babysitting.

280
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:13,420
<9-13,Phoebe>宝宝都睡了
<9-13,Phoebe>The babies are asleep.

281
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,400
<9-14,Monica>你自己撑一下一定没问题
<9-14,Monica>I'm sure you'll be okay on your own.

282
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,250
<9-15,Phoebe>但你不能把他们都扔给我啊
<9-15,Phoebe>But you can't leave me with them.

283
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,380
<9-15,Phoebe>我们可是一个团队
<9-15,Phoebe>We're a team.

284
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,920
<9-15,Phoebe>我们在打区域联防  他们会三打一欺负我
<9-15,Phoebe>We're playing a zone. They'll triple-team me!

285
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,310
<9-16,Monica>他的喉咙卡了个塑胶玩具
<9-16,Monica>He's got something plastic lodged in his throat,

286
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:25,560
<9-16,Monica>我们非去医院不可
<9-16,Monica>we've got to go to the hospital.

287
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:28,290
<9-17,Phoebe>但医生也帮不了他
<9-17,Phoebe>But a doctor won't be able to help him.

288
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:29,810
<9-17,Phoebe>反正过个七年
<9-17,Phoebe>And it's just gonna...you know,

289
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:33,070
<9-17,Phoebe>塑料就会自动降解了
<9-17,Phoebe>...naturally pass through his system in seven years.

290
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:37,410
<9-19,Phoebe>-那说的是口香糖吧  -我确定是枪
<9-19,Phoebe>- l think that's gum. - l'm pretty sure it's gun.

292
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,620
<9-20,Chandler>-真的很痛  我们走吧  -不行
<9-20,Chandler>- Okay, listen this really hurts. Let's go. - But no!

293
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:44,670
<9-21,Phoebe>男子汉才不会冲去医院
<9-21,Phoebe>A real man wouldn't just run to the hospital.

294
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:47,750
<9-21,Phoebe>别啊  想想克罗格会怎么做
<9-21,Phoebe>No! What would...what would Krog do?

295
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,080
<10-1,Joey>泊车小弟怎么还没把我的保时捷开来
<10-1,Joey>Why isn't that valet back with my Porsche?

296
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,790
<10-2,Passerby>也许因为钥匙在你手上
<10-2,Passerby>Maybe because you've got the keys?

297
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:04,660
<10-4,Rachel>全都是你的错
<10-4,Rachel>That was totally your fault.

298
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:07,110
<10-5,Ross>这能怪我吗  你还威胁法官了呢
<10-5,Ross>My fault? You threatened the judge.

299
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:10,160
<10-6,Rachel>你把书记员的打字纸撕下来
<10-6,Rachel>You ripped the paper out of the court reporter's machine!

300
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:13,200
<10-7,Ross>这是唯一能阻止他打字的方法
<10-7,Ross>That was the only way l could get him to stop typing!

301
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,500
<10-8,Joey>你们好啊  盖勒夫妇
<10-8,Joey>Hi. How are the Gellers?

<10-9,Rachel>Don't call us that.

303
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:25,570
<10-10,Ross>法官不准我们办注销
<10-10,Ross>The judge wouldn't let us get an annulment.

304
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:27,770
<10-10,Ross>现在我们唯有办离婚手续
<10-10,Ross>Now we gotta get a divorce!

305
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:31,070
<10-10,Ross>你这是被保时捷附身了吗
<10-10,Ross>Did a Porsche throw up on you?

306
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,800
<10-10,Ross>是念保时"皆"
<10-10,Ross>lt's "Porsche- a" !

00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,630
<11-1,Phoebe>你们觉得很安心  对吧

314
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:00,050
<2-11,Monica>因为这是莫妮卡的家
<2-11,Monica>Because, let's face it, we're at Monica's.

<12-3,Chandler>我一个人把孩子都带好了
<12-3,Chandler>Okay, l totally took care of the babies all by myself.

<12-4,Phoebe>喂奶  洗澡  哄他们睡觉
<12-4,Phoebe>l fed them, bathed them and put them to bed.

335
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:13,650
<12-5,Chandler>还保护他们躲过龙卷风了吗
<12-5,Chandler>And protected them from a tornado?

336
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:18,890
<12-6,Monica>我的天啊
<12-6,Monica>Oh, my God!

337
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,590
<12-7,Phoebe>对啊  宝宝都睡了

00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:24,340
<12-8,Monica>菲比  这里发生什么了
<12-8,Monica>Phoebe, what happened here?

339
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:27,610
<12-9,Phoebe>我做到了  我一个人照顾宝宝
<12-9,Phoebe>l did it. l took care of the babies all by myself.

340
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:28,950
<12-10,Monica>可我的房子
<12-10,Monica>But my apartment!

341
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:31,940
<12-11,Chandler>是菲比胜利的战场
<12-11,Chandler>Was the setting of Phoebe's triumph.

342
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:33,960
<12-12,Monica>可这一团乱
<12-12,Monica>But the mess!

343
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,280
<12-13,Chandler>这和菲比独自
<12-13,Chandler>ls not as important as the fact that

344
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,490
<12-13,Chandler>照看孩子的辛劳相比  实在不算什么
<12-13,Chandler>Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.

345
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:40,610
<12-13,Chandler>好吧
<12-13,Chandler>Right.

346
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,590
<12-14,Monica>你说得对  我不该大惊小怪
<12-14,Monica>You're right. l shouldn't freak out.

347
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:44,700
<12-14,Monica>等我们有了孩子也会这样
<12-14,Monica>This is what it'll be like when we have babies.

348
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,990
<12-14,Monica>那会是什么时候呢
<12-14,Monica>When's that?

349
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:51,530
<12-15,Chandler>菲比  你看你弄得多乱
<12-15,Chandler>Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!

350
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:01,020
<13-1,Rachel>亲爱的  你总算回来了
<13-1,Rachel>Oh, honey. Thank God you're home.

351
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,820
<13-1,Rachel>我都开始担心了
<13-1,Rachel>l was getting worried.

<13-3,Rachel>还画叉叉呀  真好
<13-3,Rachel>Little X's. Great!

356
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,180
<13-3,Rachel>这样就能将功赎过了
<13-3,Rachel>That makes up for everything.

357
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,990
<13-3,Rachel>老实说
<13-3,Rachel>You know,

00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,810
<13-14,Rachel>罗斯  等一下
<13-14,Rachel>Okay, wait, Ross. Wait a minute.

372
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:14,110
<13-14,Rachel>我有件事要坦白
<13-14,Rachel>l kind of have a little confession.

373
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,720
<13-15,Ross>什么事
<13-15,Ross>What?

374
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,580
<13-16,Rachel>结婚这件事
<13-16,Rachel>Well, you know, this whole marriage thing.

375
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,650
<13-16,Rachel>算是我的主意
<13-16,Rachel>Kind of my idea.

376
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:22,730
<13-17,Ross>你说什么
<13-17,Ross>Excuse me?

377
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:25,060
<13-18,Rachel>还记得我们醉得
<13-18,Rachel>Remember how we were too drunk

378
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:27,840
<13-18,Rachel>什么都想不起来了吗
<13-18,Rachel>to remember anything when we were married?

379
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,790
<13-19,Ross>虽然我不是很想说
<13-19,Ross>l didn't really wanna say anything,

380
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:34,530
<13-20,Rachel>但现在我开始一点点想起来了
<13-20,Rachel>but it just kind of kept coming back to me.

381
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:38,000
<13-20,Rachel>还记得我们当时在赌城  你突然
<13-20,Rachel>And umm, remember we were in the casino and for some reason,

382
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,630
<13-20,Rachel>觉得狂吃葡萄会很好玩吗
<13-20,Rachel>you thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes.

383
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,110
<13-20,Rachel>而我觉得如果我们结婚
<13-20,Rachel>And l thought it would be funnier

384
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:46,050
<13-20,Rachel>会更好玩
<13-20,Rachel>if we got married.

385
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:48,720
<13-20,Rachel>于是我们折衷
<13-20,Rachel>So as a compromise

386
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,430
<13-20,Rachel>先去结婚  然后...
<13-20,Rachel>we decided first to get married and then...

387
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:54,250
<13-20,Rachel>去吃很多葡萄
<13-20,Rachel>...to eat a lot of grapes.

388
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,460
<13-20,Rachel>所以我...
<13-20,Rachel>So, um...

389
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:01,960
<13-21,Ross>很抱歉惹出这些麻烦
<13-21,Ross>Sorry l got us into this whole thing.

390
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:04,970
<13-21,Ross>所以仔细想想
<13-21,Ross>So then, I mean if you think about it...

391
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:08,140
<13-21,Ross>这一切都是你的错咯
<13-21,Ross>...this is all your fault.

392
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,740
<13-22,Rachel>是  不要得寸进尺
<13-22,Rachel>Yeah, don't push it, though.

393
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:16,340
<13-22,Rachel>我想说
<13-22,Rachel>l gotta say...

394
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,470
<13-23,Ross>我知道我跟很多人离过婚
<13-23,Ross>...l know l divorce a lot of women.

395
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:25,620
<13-23,Ross>却从来没想过会跟你离婚
<13-23,Ross>Never thought l'd be divorcing you.

396
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,350
<13-23,Ross>我知道
<13-23,Ross>l know.

397
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:29,410
<13-24,Rachel>我总觉得要是我们结婚
<13-24,Rachel>l always thought if we got married,

398
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:31,460
<13-24,Rachel>就一定会天长地久
<13-24,Rachel>that'd be the one that stuck.

399
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,670
<13-24,Rachel>也不会是秘密结婚
<13-24,Rachel>And it wouldn't be a secret...

400
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,220
<13-24,Rachel>也不会在必胜客吃酒席
<13-24,Rachel>...and we wouldn't have our wedding dinner at Pizza Hut.

401
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,340
<13-25,Ross>我有请客吗

404
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:49,890
<13-27,Ross>这真是我听过最凄凉的事了
<13-27,Ross>That may be the most depressing thing l've heard in my life.

405
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:55,680
<13-27,Ross>我去律师那里送文件
<13-27,Ross>I should probably get these to my lawyer's office.

406
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,790
<13-28,Rachel>罗斯  谢谢你把事情都办妥
