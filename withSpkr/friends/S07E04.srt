147
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,610
<5-6,Phoebe>你得考虑到他们的工作能力
<5-6,Phoebe>You hire them because they're qualified.

181
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:44,460
<6-16,Joey>你坐在漂亮的位于小走廊的办公室里
<6-16,Joey>Sitting up here in your fancy, small-halled building...

182
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:48,590
<6-16,Joey>要大明星在你面前使出浑身解数
<6-16,Joey>...making stars jump through hoops for you.

<6-16,Joey>你知道吗

184
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,360
<6-16,Joey>我就是那个大明星
<6-16,Joey>This is one star whose hoop...

185
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,920
<6-16,Joey>我就是试演的   大明星试演
<6-16,Joey>This is the star the hoop... This hoop...

186
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,670
<6-12,Joey>我是德雷克医生
<6-12,Joey>I was Dr. Drake Ramoray!

187
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,820
<7-1,Rachel>泰格  你在这里做什么

<7-2,Tag>I came to thank you for not laughing in my face yesterday.

189
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:15,510
<7-2,Tag>我注意到你办公室里没有植物
<7-2,Tag>I noticed there aren't any plants,

190
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:17,950
<7-2,Tag>所以就帮你带盆植物过来

194
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,090
<7-4,Tag>我猜我不应该在简历上写"注意力敏锐"
<7-4,Tag>So I guess I shouldn't put "good at noticing stuff" on my resume.

208
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:12,100
<8-3,Chandler>我想这要比听到"该死又是你"要好多了
<8-3,Chandler>Always nicer to hear than, "Oh, crap, you again."

209
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:16,600
<8-6,Monica>甜心  我帮你准备了一个大惊喜

220
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:56,150
<8-19,Ross>那是墨西哥卷饼
<8-19,Ross>Those are tacos.

221
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:58,330
<8-20,Monica>失陪一下  墨西哥先生
<8-20,Monica>Excuse me, Mr. Mexico.

<8-21,Ross>没关系我不吃了  我还是不敢吃那玩意
<8-21,Ross>Either way, I'll pass. Still can't eat those.

223
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,400
<8-21,Ross>什么事那么好笑
<8-21,Ross>What's so funny?

224
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,350
<8-22,Monica>我没有笑
<8-22,Monica>I'm not laughing.

225
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:30,060
<8-23,Ross>你跟她说了
<8-23,Ross>You told her!

226
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:33,560
<8-24,Chandler>南希·汤普森被开除了
<8-24,Chandler>Nancy Thompsors getting fired.

227
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:39,250
<8-25,Ross>好吧  那时我食物中毒

00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,190
<8-25,Ross>我又没得选
<8-25,Ross>It's not like I chose to do it!

229
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:44,770
<8-25,Ross>我又没有说"怎样才会让飞车更好玩"
<8-25,Ross>It's not like I said, "What would make this ride more fun?"

230
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:49,790
<8-26,Monica>对  你说的对  抱歉  我不该笑的
<8-26,Monica>Right. You're right, I'm sorry. I shouldn't be laughing.

00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:52,860
<8-26,Monica>我应该帮你先铺好报纸
<8-26,Monica>I should be laying down papers for you.

<8-27,Ross>-你怎么可以   - 我没得选择  我们要结婚了
<8-27,Ross>- How could you tell you? - I had to. We're getting married.

00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:00,820
<8-28,Chandler>夫妻不能有秘密
<8-28,Chandler>Married couples can't keep secrets from one to another.

234
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,320
<8-29,Ross>我猜莫妮卡应该知道在大西洋城发生的事
<8-29,Ross>I guess Monica should know about Atlantic City.

235
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,540
<8-31,Monica>兄弟
<8-31,Monica>Dude!

236

<8-33,Chandler>你没有听到我说"兄弟"吗
<8-33,Chandler>Did you not hear me say, "Dude!"?

238
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:16,610
<8-34,Ross>有个女孩跟钱德勒抛媚眼
<8-34,Ross>...and this girl is making eyes at Chandler.

239
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:22,300
<8-34,Ross>他走过去  一两分钟后我看到他们在接吻
<8-34,Ross>So he goes over to her and after a minute or two I see them kissing.

240
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,710
<8-34,Ross>现在你在想
<8-34,Ross>Now, I know what you're thinking

241
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:26,950
<8-34,Ross>"他可不是和酒吧里的女人鬼混的男人"
<8-34,Ross>"He's not the type to go to bars and make out with girls."

242
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:29,020
<8-34,Ross>你是对的  他的确不是那种
<8-34,Ross>And you're right. He's not the type of guys...

243
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:32,430
<8-34,Ross>在酒吧里的女人鬼混的男人
<8-34,Ross>...to go to bars and make out with girls.

244
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:36,770

275
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:37,140
<10-5,Ross>或许钱德勒也应该知道你的秘密
<10-5,Ross>Maybe Chandler should know your secrets too.

276

<10-6,Monica>我已经告诉他一切了  你给我闭嘴

289
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,700
<11-1,Joey>这种事怎么会发生在我身上
<11-1,Joey>How could this happen to me?

<11-1,Joey>昨天我演出两部电视剧  今天我什么都没有
<11-1,Joey>Yesterday I had two TV shows. Today I got nothing.

<11-2,Rachel>等一下  《我们的日子》呢
<11-2,Rachel>Wait a minute, what happened to Days of our Lives?

292
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:44,820
<11-3,Joey>他们可能有点生我的气
<11-3,Joey>Well, they might be a little mad at me over there.

293
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:46,790
<11-4,Phoebe>发生了什么事
<11-4,Phoebe>What happened?

294
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:51,520
<11-5,Joey>或许我有点生气  也许我让他们去见鬼了
<11-5,Joey>Well, maybe I got a little upset, and maybe I told them where they could go.

295
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:55,040
<11-6,Rachel>乔伊  你为什么要那么做
<11-6,Rachel>Joey, why would you do that?

296
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,460
<11-7,Joey>因为他们要我试镜

<12-15,Rachel>I know that,

315
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:04,630
<12-15,Rachel>我知道雇用他不是明智之举

00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:02,400
<14-5,Joey>不会的  施特莱克医生擅长施展奇迹

342
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:45,300
<16-2,Ross>我的解释是那个清洁妇勾引我
<16-2,Ross>And in my defense, the cleaning lady came on to me.

351
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:18,020
<16-11,Ross>我们不该把彼此的秘密再告诉其他人
<16-11,Ross>We should keep the stuff we told each other secret from everyone else.

<16-12,Monica>一点都没错
<16-12,Monica>Yeah, definitely.

00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:27,990
<16-13,Ross>太空飞车事件的人去玩了
<16-13,Ross>with people who don't know the Space Mountain story.

00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:32,050
<16-14,Monica>-我建议你别去找菲比  -天啊
<16-14,Monica>- Then I'd steer clear of Phoebe. - Man!
