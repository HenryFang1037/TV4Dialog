1
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,050
<1-2,Monica>我看到保时捷停在前门
<1-2,Monica>I saw the Porsche parked out front.

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:08,250
<1-3,Ross>你能把钥匙借给我一下吗
<1-3,Ross>Can I get the keys?

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,840
<1-3,Ross>我想带那个坏小子去兜个风
<1-3,Ross>Thought I'd take that bad boy out for a spin.

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,030
<1-4,Rachel>等等  罗斯可以开你的保时捷
<1-4,Rachel>Wait a minute! You let Ross drive the Porsche

5
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:15,770
<1-4,Rachel>我问你时  你说只有你自己能开
<1-4,Rachel>and when I ask, you say you're the only one allowed to drive it.

6
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:18,700
<1-5,Monica>他是我哥哥  而且他开车跟乌龟爬一样
<1-5,Monica>He's my brother, plus he drives so slow

7
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:19,660
<1-5,Monica>不会出事的
<1-5,Monica>he could never hurt it.

8
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:22,350
<1-6,Ross>那是辆车子  莫妮卡  又不是火箭飞船
<1-6,Ross>It's a car, Monica, not a rocket ship.

9
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:24,240
<1-7,Monica>罗斯
<1-7,Monica>Whatever, Ross.

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,630
<1-7,Monica>兜完风之后  帮我换一下刹车灯的灯泡
<1-7,Monica>Just replace the bulbs in the brake lights after you're done.

11
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,120
<1-10,Phoebe>我看到保时捷了  莫妮卡  看着很酷
<1-10,Phoebe>Saw the Porsche out there, Mon. Looking good.

12
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,590
<1-11,Joey>我什么时候能再开着它去兜风
<1-11,Joey>When do I get to take that baby out again?

13
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,990
<1-12,Rachel>你让乔伊开保时捷
<1-12,Rachel>You let Joey drive it?

14
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:42,960
<1-13,Phoebe>我从来没开过  一次都没有
<1-13,Phoebe>I've never driven it, okay? Not once.

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,980
<1-13,Phoebe>好吧  只有一次  好吧  我常开着出门
<1-13,Phoebe>Okay, once. Okay, I drive it all the time.

16
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,810
<1-14,Monica>我们的"你可以开它去兜风
<1-14,Monica>Nice work, everybody. So much for the "you-can-drive-it

17
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:52,900
<1-14,Monica>但别告诉瑞秋"计划宣告失败
<1-14,Monica>but-don't-tell-Rachel" plan.

18
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:55,430
<1-15,Rachel>哇  我不敢相信你骗我
<1-15,Rachel>Wow, I can't believe you lied to me.

19
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:56,590
<1-16,Phoebe>交给我来吧
<1-16,Phoebe>I can fix this.

20
00:00:56,630 --> 00:01:00,330
<1-16,Phoebe>莫妮卡  瑞秋认为你满嘴只知道谈婚礼的事
<1-16,Phoebe>Monica, Rachel thinks all you talk about is the wedding.

21
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:05,150
<1-17,Monica>我不会让你开保时捷
<1-17,Monica>Rachel, the reason why I won't let you drive the Porsche

22
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:07,930
<1-17,Monica>因为你是个很差劲的司机
<1-17,Monica>is because you're a terrible driver.

23
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:10,280
<1-17,Monica>好了  这件事跟婚礼无关
<1-17,Monica>There. That wasn't about the wedding.

24
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,560
<1-18,Ross>如果你想开保时捷去兜风
<1-18,Ross>Rach, if you want to go for a ride in the Porsche

25
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,010
<1-18,Ross>我可以载你在街角转一下
<1-18,Ross>I'll be glad to take you for a quick spin around the block.

26
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,120
<1-19,Joey>你接下来几小时都没事吗
<1-19,Joey>Yeah, you got a couple hours?

38
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:01,360
<2-1,Ross>刚才真是痛快
<2-1,Ross>Whew, that was a brisk ride.

39
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,560
<2-2,Rachel>-你开了车篷吧  -飞一般的感觉
<2-2,Rachel>- Take the top down, did you? - Only way to fly.

40
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:08,960
<2-4,Rachel>来嘛  罗斯  把钥匙给我
<2-4,Rachel>Come on, Ross. Give me the keys.

41
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:10,510
<2-4,Rachel>莫妮卡她冤枉我了
<2-4,Rachel>Monica does not know what she's talking about!

42
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:12,360
<2-4,Rachel>我是个很棒的司机
<2-4,Rachel>I'm an excellent driver.

43
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,830
<2-5,Ross>你开车飞快  又不负责任
<2-5,Ross>You're fast and irresponsible.

44
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,670
<2-5,Ross>你的确是个差劲的司机
<2-5,Ross>That adds up to a bad driver.

45
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:20,420
<2-6,Rachel>高中时  这几个特点让我成为啦啦队长
<2-6,Rachel>In high school, that added up to head cheerleader.

46
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:27,040
<2-7,Ross>你看到那个女孩看我的眼神了吗
<2-7,Ross>Did you see the look that girl just gave me?

47
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:31,070
<2-7,Ross>她一定是看到了我开保时捷的模样
<2-7,Ross>She must've seen me cruising in the bad boy.

48
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:34,030
<2-8,Rachel>-她在看你的鸟窝头  -什么
<2-8,Rachel>- She's checking out your beehive. - What?

49
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,510
<2-9,Ross>-把梳子给我  -钥匙给我
<2-9,Ross>- Give me a brush. - Give me the keys.

50
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,430
<2-10,Rachel>-不行  -那我就不给你梳子
<2-10,Rachel>- No way! - Well, no brush.

51
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,550
<2-12,Rachel>好吧  没关系
<2-12,Rachel>Fine. It doesn't matter.

52
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:43,150
<2-13,Ross>如果我没记错
<2-13,Ross>Because if I remember correctly,

53
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:45,950
<2-13,Ross>洗手间地上有一把梳子
<2-13,Ross>there's a comb on the floor of the bathroom.

54
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:03,970
<2-14,Rachel>这是我的赡养费
<2-14,Rachel>Alimony.

55
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:10,940
<3-1,Monica>钱德勒  你爸还没寄回函给我们
<3-1,Monica>Chandler, we still haven't gotten an RSVP from your dad.

56
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,490
<3-2,Chandler>对  或许那是因为我没寄喜贴给他
<3-2,Chandler>Oh, right. Maybe that's because I didn't send him an invitation.

57
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:20,220
<3-3,Monica>他是你爸爸  他应该来参加我们的婚礼
<3-3,Monica>Chandler, he's your father. He should be at our wedding.

58
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,820
<3-4,Chandler>我跟他根本不熟
<3-4,Chandler>I don't even know the man, okay?

59
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,340
<3-4,Chandler>我们关系很疏远  我好几年没跟他见过面了
<3-4,Chandler>We're not that close. I haven't seen him in years.

60
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,830
<3-5,Monica>如果他知道我们没有邀请他呢
<3-5,Monica>What are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn't even asked?

61
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:29,800
<3-6,Chandler>我们的生活圈不一样
<3-6,Chandler>He doesn't have to know! It's not like we run in the same circles.

62
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,030
<3-6,Chandler>我跟你们来往  而他...
<3-6,Chandler>I hang out with you guys and he...

63
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:35,200
<3-6,Chandler>他在拉斯维加斯表演变装秀
<3-6,Chandler>...stars in a drag show in Vegas.

64
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,790
<3-7,Phoebe>我想和他交换生活圈
<3-7,Phoebe>I think I want to trade circles.

65
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,930
<3-8,Chandler>相信我  你也不会想邀请他过来
<3-8,Chandler>Trust me. You don't want him there, either.

66
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:42,560
<3-8,Chandler>到时候没有人会看新娘...
<3-8,Chandler>Nobody will stare at the bride...

67
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,700
<3-8,Chandler>因为新郎的爸爸穿着露背连衣裙
<3-8,Chandler>...when the father of the groom is wearing a backless dress.

68
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,420
<3-9,Monica>那又怎么样
<3-9,Monica>So what?

69
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:50,970
<3-9,Monica>只要他不穿婚纱  我根本不在乎
<3-9,Monica>As long as he's not wearing a white dress and veil, I don't care.

70
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:53,340
<3-10,Phoebe>我得去买点东西
<3-10,Phoebe>I think I need to do some shopping.

00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:20,110
<4-5,Ross>我绝不会让你开这辆车
<4-5,Ross>There's no way I'm letting you drive this car.

76
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:22,310
<4-5,Ross>你为什么不把钥匙还给我
<4-5,Ross>Why don't you just hand over the keys.

<4-6,Rachel>别启动引擎

00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:45,890
<6-10,Chandler>你得想个新说法来形容我的苦痛经历
<6-10,Chandler>You'd have to come up with a new word for what I went through.

130
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,950

<6-14,Chandler>-谁是嘉利巴迪先生  -那很重要吗
<6-14,Chandler>- Who's Mr. Garibaldi? - Does it matter?!

136
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:32,320
<6-15,Monica>你不再是十四岁的孩子  好吗
<6-15,Monica>Chandler, you're not 14 anymore, okay?

137
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,770
<6-15,Monica>你该忘了那些往事
<6-15,Monica>Maybe it's time you let that stuff go.

138
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:37,720
<6-15,Monica>如果他没来参加你的婚礼
<6-15,Monica>If your father is not at your wedding,

143
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,660
<6-19,Monica>你以前又赢过几次
<6-19,Monica>How much did you ever win before?

00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:01,120
<7-2,Phoebe>你知道当你穿着裤子
<7-2,Phoebe>Listen, you know how when you're wearing pants

145
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,650
<7-3,Joey>身体往前倾时  我可以看到你的内裤吗
<7-3,Joey>and you lean forward, I check out your underwear?

146
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:04,740
<7-4,Phoebe>知道
<7-4,Phoebe>Yeah.

147
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,470

<7-5,Joey>我看到他穿着女人的内裤
<7-5,Joey>...I saw that he was wearing women's underwear.

149
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:13,710
<7-6,Phoebe>我知道  那是我的内裤
<7-6,Phoebe>I know. They were mine.

150
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,660
<7-7,Joey>等一下  那样太奇怪了
<7-7,Joey>No, no, wait. That's weird.

151
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,320
<7-8,Phoebe>我们只是闹着玩
<7-8,Phoebe>No, it's not. We were goofing around,

152
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,250
<7-8,Phoebe>我跟他打赌他不敢穿
<7-8,Phoebe>and I dared him to try them on.

153
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:25,480
<7-9,Joey>那真的很奇怪
<7-9,Joey>That's weird!

154
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,990
<7-10,Phoebe>-我正穿着他的内裤  -那还挺性感的
<7-10,Phoebe>- I'm wearing his briefs right now. - That's kind of hot.

155
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:33,030
<7-11,Joey>我也这么觉得  你知道前面那个小洞吗
<7-11,Joey>I think so too. And that little flap?

156
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:35,120
<7-12,Phoebe>刚好可以拿来放我的口红
<7-12,Phoebe>It's great for holding my lipstick.

157
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,700
<7-13,Joey>这种事情我倒没机会知道
<7-13,Joey>I wouldn't know about that.

158
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:48,380
<7-14,Phoebe>杰克说  女人的内裤更舒服
<7-14,Phoebe>Jake says that womers underwear is actually more comfortable.

159
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:51,170
<7-14,Phoebe>他喜欢丝质内裤贴在皮肤上的感觉
<7-14,Phoebe>And he loves how silk feels against his skin.

160
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:52,610
<7-15,Joey>接下来他会说
<7-15,Joey>Next thing you know, he'll be telling you

<7-15,Joey>穿上你的高跟鞋他更婀娜多姿

00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,930
<7-16,Phoebe>杰克没什么不正常的
<7-16,Phoebe>There's nothing wrong with Jake.

164
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,430
<7-16,Phoebe>我担心的是你
<7-16,Phoebe>I'm thinking even more than you.

165
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:04,840
<7-17,Joey>他看起来像是穿着粉红色蕾丝内裤的伐木工人
<7-17,Joey>He looked like a real lumberjack in those pink lacies.

166
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:10,780
<7-18,Phoebe>我是说只有真正相信自己有男子气概的男人
<7-18,Phoebe>I'm just saying only a man completely secure with his masculinity

167
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,670
<7-18,Phoebe>才会穿上女人的内裤
<7-18,Phoebe>could wear women's underwear.

168

<7-18,Phoebe>我敢说你办不到
<7-18,Phoebe>I don't think you could ever do that.

<7-19,Joey>-我很相信自己的男子气概  -随便你
<7-19,Joey>- I am secure with my masculinity. - Okay, whatever.

326
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:30,610
<14-5,Rachel>或许他看到你的手

328
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:40,980

<14-10,Ross>我不知道  但应该没有超过六十英里
<14-10,Ross>No, I don't, but it couldn't have been more than 60.

<14-11,Policeman>你说得对  只有三十七英里
<14-11,Policeman>You're right. It was 37.

334
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,700
<14-12,Ross>你该不会因为我开得太慢而开我罚单吧
<14-12,Ross>You're not gonna give me a ticket for driving too slow, are you?

335
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,930
<14-13,Policeman>没错

<14-17,Ross>你不想想听听我做了什么梦...
<14-17,Ross>You don't want to hear about my dream...

341
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:33,220
<14-17,Ross>警官...

<14-18,Policeman>...Pretty?

343
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:39,620
<14-18,Policeman>是佩坦警官才对
<14-18,Policeman>It's Petty.

344
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:43,830
<14-18,Policeman>我马上帮你开罚单
<14-18,Policeman>I'll be right back with your ticket.

345
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:49,470
<14-19,Rachel>-你有个儿子  -我知道
<14-19,Rachel>- You have a son. - I know. I know.

<15-1,Phoebe>-你觉得好一点了吗  -我好多了
<15-1,Phoebe>- You feel better? - Yeah. Much.

347
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,130
<15-1,Phoebe>听着...
<15-1,Phoebe>Listen...

348
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:04,390
<15-2,Joey>我并不是担心我的男子气概...
<15-2,Joey>Not that I'm insecure about my manood or anything...

349
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:08,840
<15-2,Joey>但我觉得我应该马上去泡个女人
<15-2,Joey>...but I think I need to hook up with a woman right now.

350
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,820

352
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,410
<15-7,Woman>应该不认识
<15-7,Woman>I don't think so.

353
