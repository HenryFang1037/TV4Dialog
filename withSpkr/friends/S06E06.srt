<1-10,Joey>乔伊·崔比安尼不再...
<1-10,Joey>Joey Tribbiani does not take charity...

15
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:42,550
<1-10,Joey>接受施舍
<1-10,Joey>...anymore.

16
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:46,400
<1-11,Chandler>-这不是施舍  乔伊  -不行  别再说了
<1-11,Chandler>- lt's not charity, Joe. - No! Forget it! Okay?

<1-12,Joey>谢谢  但我不想再拿你的钱了
<1-12,Joey>I mean thanks, but I'm done taking money from you.

18
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:50,120
<1-12,Joey>我可以养活自己
<1-12,Joey>All right, I can take care of myself.

19
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,800
<1-12,Joey>-还有什么  说吧  -好吧
<1-12,Joey>- Now, what's next? Come on. - Okay

00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,870
<1-13,Chandler>好  这是电费
<1-13,Chandler>Here's the electric bill.

21
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:57,050
<1-14,Joey>-用个电要这么多钱啊  -对
<1-14,Joey>- This is how much we pay for electric? - Well, yeah.

22
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,690
<1-14,Joey>那其他的帐单之后再看吧
<1-14,Joey>So we'll do the rest of the bills later, then?

34
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,750
<2-1,Phoebe>那乔伊也得搬出去吗
<2-1,Phoebe>So is Joey going to have to give up the apartment?

35
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:46,690
<2-2,Chandler>希望不用
<2-2,Chandler>No, I hope not!

36
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:48,740
<2-2,Chandler>我想给他钱  但是他不收
<2-2,Chandler>I tried to offer him money, but he wouldn't take it.

37
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,200
<2-3,Phoebe>你觉得他需要多少
<2-3,Phoebe>Well, how much do you think he needs?

38
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,920
<2-4,Chandler>我想一千五应该够他活几个月
<2-4,Chandler>I figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, y'know?

39
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,120
<2-4,Chandler>但我得骗他收下
<2-4,Chandler>...but I have to trick him into taking it

40
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,880
<2-4,Chandler>-免得伤害他的自尊  -没错
<2-4,Chandler>- so I don't hurt his pride. - Yeah.

41
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,290
<2-5,Phoebe>你怎么不雇他当演员
<2-5,Phoebe>Why don't you hire him as an actor?

42
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,720
<2-5,Phoebe>你可以叫他扮装演短剧
<2-5,Phoebe>You could have him dress up

43
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,370
<2-5,Phoebe>穿个小裙  怎样都行
<2-5,Phoebe>and put on skits whenever you want.

44
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,990
<2-6,Chandler>那样对自尊"确实"有帮助
<2-6,Chandler>Well, that would help the pride thing.

45
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,220
<2-7,Monica>哇  大美人一个
<2-7,Monica>Wow, you look great!

46
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,270
<2-8,Chandler>明天要不要搬来跟我住

<2-10,Chandler>So, what do you girls have planned for tonight?

49
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:21,370
<2-11,Monica>与其难过
<2-11,Monica>Well, instead of being sad

50
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:23,270
<2-11,Monica>今晚过后我就要和瑞秋分离
<2-11,Monica>that tonight is my last night together with Rachel

51
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:25,530
<2-11,Monica>我们觉得不如去吃饭庆祝...
<2-11,Monica>We thought we'd go out to dinner and celebrate the fact that

52
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:27,170
<2-11,Monica>瑞秋马上要搬去跟菲比住
<2-11,Monica>Rachel's moving in with Phoebe.

<2-12,Phoebe>-还有我的生日  -今天不是你的生日
<2-12,Phoebe>- And also my birthday. - lt's not your birthday.

54
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,930
<2-14,Phoebe>这样讲好恶劣
<2-14,Phoebe>What a mean thing to say!

55
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:35,450
<2-14,Phoebe>换我  就绝不会戳破你
<2-14,Phoebe>I'd never tell you it wasn't your birthday.

56
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:42,060
<2-18,Phoebe>那你们男生有什么节目吗
<2-18,Phoebe>So you guys have anything planned for the big last night?

57
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,660
<2-19,Chandler>与其一起出去玩
<2-19,Chandler>Instead of just hanging out,

58
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,680
<2-19,Chandler>我们决定什么也不做
<2-19,Chandler>we figure we'd do nothing.

59
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,820
<2-20,Ross>今晚是尼克队首战,
<2-20,Ross>Knicks' season opener tonight.

60

00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:53,940
<2-21,Joey>不知道呢  罗斯
<2-21,Joey>I don't know, Ross.

62
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,650
<2-21,Joey>不想听你又说为了成为古生物学家
<2-21,Joey>not if you're gonna talk about how you gave up a career in basketball

63
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:58,030
<2-22,Ross>而放弃打球的事
<2-22,Ross>to become a paleontologist.

64
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:00,070
<2-22,Ross>我的确是放弃了打球人生

<6-9,Phoebe>其实不必这么难过
<6-9,Phoebe>This doesn't have to be so sad, though, you know?

146
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,660
<6-9,Phoebe>或许你们应该停止
<6-9,Phoebe>Maybe instead of just thinking about

147
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,030
<6-9,Phoebe>怀念对方的美好
<6-9,Phoebe>how much you're gonna miss each other,

148
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:06,860
<6-9,Phoebe>转而想想对方的不好
<6-9,Phoebe>you should like think of the things you're not gonna miss.

149
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,990
<6-10,Monica>我觉得没有
<6-10,Monica>I don't think there's anything.

155
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,770
<6-15,Rachel>你从来不准我移动留言笔
<6-15,Rachel>...that you're never allowed to move the phone pen.

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,150
<6-21,Monica>得从睡着在沙发上的你的手背上
<6-21,Monica>if you have to read them off the back of your hand

166
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:03,260
<6-21,Monica>自己读留言不算
<6-21,Monica>after you fall asleep on the couch.

167
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,750
<6-22,Rachel>那你是没接到谁的留言  钱德勒吗
<6-22,Rachel>So you missed a message from who? Chandler?

00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,060
<9-1,Phoebe>记得这双直排轮鞋吗
<9-1,Phoebe>Hey, remember the rollerblades?

<9-5,Phoebe>我有打给她啊

<9-7,Rachel>My God! I can't find a boyfriend.

211
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,250
<9-7,Rachel>干脆杀到对面去
<9-7,Rachel>So I guess I’ll just stumble across the hall

212
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,270
<9-7,Rachel>看到谁就上谁
<9-7,Rachel>and sleep with the first guy I find there!

<9-8,Phoebe>就得快点了
<9-8,Phoebe>if we want to make those dinner reservations.

220
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:15,670
<10-2,Joey>和五百元
<10-2,Joey>...and $500.

221
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,560
<10-3,Chandler>有别的办法可以把钱赢回去
<10-3,Chandler>But there are other ways to win back your money.

222
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,440
<10-3,Chandler>要不要玩二十一点
<10-3,Chandler>How about a little uh, a little Blackjack?

223
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:21,980
<10-4,Joey>我不在行
<10-4,Joey>Nah, not my game.

224
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,690
<10-5,Chandler>好吧  要不这样
<10-5,Chandler>Okay, uh, how about, how about-y'know what?

<10-8,Joey>-我不会玩杯牌  -我教你

<10-20,Joey>Damn, I am good at Cups!

238
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,170
<11-1,Monica>我不要跟她说话
<11-1,Monica>I'm not talking to her.

239
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:10,370
<11-2,Phoebe>总得有人先开口
<11-2,Phoebe>Well, one of you has to take the first step...

240
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:11,350
<11-2,Phoebe>这个人应该是你
<11-2,Phoebe>And it should be you,

241
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:14,190
<11-2,Phoebe>因为她要搬走  她比较难过
<11-2,Phoebe>because she's the one who's leaving. lt's harder for her.

242
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,340
<11-3,Monica>也许吧...
<11-3,Monica>Maybe you're right.

243
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:20,050
<11-3,Monica>但她嘲笑我的留言笔
<11-3,Monica>But she made fun of my phone pen!

244
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,960
<11-4,Phoebe>我知道  我也觉得很过分
<11-4,Phoebe>I know. I took it hard too.

245
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,670
<11-5,Monica>瑞秋  刚才的事我很...
<11-5,Monica>Listen Rachel, I feel bad about what happened- -

00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,860
<15-5,Joey>我连半副杯牌都凑不到  什么都没有
<15-5,Joey>I didn't even get half a cup! Nothing!

362
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,760
<15-6,Chandler>天啊
<15-6,Chandler>Oh, man!

363
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:58,850
<15-7,Joey>他之前也没玩过  我发现重要的一件事
<15-7,Joey>He never played before either. You know what I think?

364
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:02,480
<15-7,Joey>我发现玩杯牌都靠新手的手气
<15-7,Joey>I think beginner's luck is very important in Cups!

365
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:05,600
<15-8,Chandler>好  我们再玩一把  就一把
<15-8,Chandler>All right, let's play one more hand. One more hand.

366
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,410
<15-9,Joey>不要  我一毛钱也输不起了
<15-9,Joey>No, no more! I cannot lose another dime.

367
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:09,580
<15-9,Joey>我是说真的
<15-9,Joey>I'm serious this time.

368
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,080
<15-9,Joey>事实上
<15-9,Joey>In fact, look.

369
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,050
<15-9,Joey>我要送你一样东西
<15-9,Joey>I wanna give you something, okay?

370
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,490
<15-9,Joey>现在先送给你
<15-9,Joey>Let me give it to you now

371
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,530
<15-9,Joey>免得我为了赌债拿去当
<15-9,Joey>before I pawn it for Cups money.

372
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,140
<15-10,Chandler>我要把大白狗送给你
<15-10,Chandler>I want you to have the big, white dog...

373
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:25,020
<15-9,Joey>作为感谢
<15-9,Joey>as a kinda of a, y'know, thank you

374
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,360
<15-9,Joey>你这些年来的照顾
<15-9,Joey>for being such a great roommate.

375
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,060
<15-10,Chandler>我不能收这个雕像  那是你的最爱
<15-10,Chandler>I can't take the big white dog. You love it.

376
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,550
<15-11,Joey>他不是雕像  他是活的
<15-11,Joey>It's "him." Not "it."

377
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:37,040
<15-12,Chandler>要是我跟你买呢
<15-12,Chandler>What if I bought it from you, you know?

378
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,460
<15-12,Chandler>你可以以合理的价格卖给我
<15-12,Chandler>Then your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price.

379
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,490
<15-12,Chandler>一千五如何
<15-12,Chandler>Say $ 1500?

380
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,540
<15-13,Joey>等一下  我知道你想干嘛了
<15-13,Joey>Wait a second. I see what you're trying to do here.

381
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:50,360
<15-13,Joey>你又想塞钱给我
<15-13,Joey>You're trying to give me money again!

382
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,570
<15-14,Chandler>我什么时候塞钱给你了
<15-14,Chandler>When did I try to give you money?

383
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:54,540
<15-15,Joey>之前看帐单的时候
<15-15,Joey>Before, over there,with the bills!

384
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,410
<15-15,Joey>你想施舍我  我说不要
<15-15,Joey>You tried to give me charity, I said no,

385
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:57,930
<15-15,Joey>你也就算了  对吧
<15-15,Joey>you dropped it, okay?

386
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:00,050
<15-15,Joey>然后我们开心度过最后一晚
<15-15,Joey>We had a nice last night together.

387
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:01,650
<15-15,Joey>然后我们说笑  赌钱
<15-15,Joey>We had some fun, we gambled,

388
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:03,690
<15-15,Joey>谁也没塞钱给谁
<15-15,Joey>nobody tried to give anybody any money.

389
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:08,820
<15-15,Joey>结果现在你突然又想来这套
<15-15,Joey>Now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again!

390
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,890
<15-16,Chandler>我只是想帮助你
<15-16,Chandler>I'm trying to help you out, okay?

391
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:12,870
<15-16,Chandler>我只想确定你的生活没问题
<15-16,Chandler>I wanna make sure that you would be okay.

392
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:15,170
<15-17,Joey>我会没问题的  钱德勒  听着
<15-17,Joey>I will be okay. Look Chandler,

393
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:16,510
<15-17,Joey>你不能老觉得
<15-17,Joey>You gotta get it out of your head

394
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:19,540
<15-17,Joey>我无法照顾自己
<15-17,Joey>that I can't take care of myself, okay?

395
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:23,680
<15-17,Joey>我不会怀念你借钱给我
<15-17,Joey>Look, I'm not gonna miss you helping me out with money.

396
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,420
<15-17,Joey>我唯一会怀念的
<15-17,Joey>The only thing I'm gonna miss...

397
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,960
<15-17,Joey>就是你
<15-17,Joey>...is you.

398
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:32,410
<15-17,Joey>现在还有这只狗
<15-17,Joey>And now the dog.

399
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:43,790
<16-1,Monica>-到了打电话给我  好吗  -好
<16-1,Monica>- Call me when you get there, okay? - Okay.

<16-3,Monica>I'm really gonna miss you.

401
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,510
<16-4,Rachel>钥匙要还你
<16-4,Rachel>I have your key.

402
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,760
<16-4,Rachel>拿去  谢谢
<16-4,Rachel>- Here you go. - Thanks.

403
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:05,220
<16-7,Rachel>天啊  我们真傻
<16-7,Rachel>God, this is silly.

404
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,360
<16-7,Rachel>再过几小时又能见面了嘛
<16-7,Rachel>I'll see you in a couple of hours.

405
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:10,430
<16-9,Rachel>房子  再见
<16-9,Rachel>Bye, house.

<16-11,Monica>-再见  -再见
<16-11,Monica>- Byebye. - Bye.

<16-13,Monica>-她真的走了  -我知道
<16-13,Monica>- She really left. - I know.

00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:51,430
<16-15,Monica>-谢谢你  -不客气  室友
<16-15,Monica>- Thank you. - No problem, roomie.

409
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:01,850
<16-17,Monica>-我可以问你一个问题吗  -当然可以
<16-17,Monica>- Can I ask you a question? - Sure.

410
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,780
<16-19,Monica>那只狗怎么会在这里
<16-19,Monica>What the hell is that dog doing here?

411
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:12,320
<17-1,Chandler>我捏造了杯牌游戏  好塞钱给乔伊
<17-1,Chandler>I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.

412
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,680
<17-2,Ross>-现在你想把钱要回去  -没错
<17-2,Ross>- And now you want that money back? - Exactly.

413
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:18,650
<17-4,Ross>钱德勒  你以为我是白痴吗
<17-4,Ross>Chandler, what kind of idiot do you take me for?

414
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:21,900
<17-5,Chandler>没有那种牌  那是我捏造的
<17-5,Chandler>It's not a real game. I made it up.

415
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,580
<17-6,Ross>很遗撼你的钱没了
<17-6,Ross>I'm sorry you lost your money.

416
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,320
<17-6,Ross>但我赢得光明正大
<17-6,Ross>But I won it fair and square.

417
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,900
<17-7,Chandler>游戏是假的
<17-7,Chandler>At a fake game!

418
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:30,630
<17-8,Ross>如果你想赢一点回去
<17-8,Ross>If you wanna try to make some of it back...

419
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:32,690
<17-8,Ross>我愿意陪你玩
<17-8,Ross>...I'd be glad to play you for it.

420
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:34,080
<17-8,Ross>但我必须警告你
<17-8,Ross>But I should warn you.

421
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,490
<17-8,Ross>我是杯牌高手
<17-8,Ross>I am very good at Cups.

422
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:41,200
<17-9,Chandler>好  你上次玩
<17-9,Chandler>Okay, I assume the saucer card came up

423
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,570
<17-9,Chandler>有出现杯盘牌吧
<17-9,Chandler>when you played last.

424
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:43,890
<17-10,Ross>没有
<17-10,Ross>No

425
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:46,860
<17-11,Chandler>看看这次会不会出现
<17-11,Chandler>Let's see if it comes up this time.
