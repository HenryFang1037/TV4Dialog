<2-3,Joey>我家不欢迎你  我讨厌这样
<2-3,Joey>Oh hey, no, you're not welcome. Okay, look, I hate this!

26
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:34,170
<2-3,Joey>你们害我不断出丑
<2-3,Joey>You guys keep embarrassing me!

27
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,970
<2-3,Joey>昨天瑞秋在这边浴室看到你的剃刀
<2-3,Joey>Yesterday, Rachel found your razor in our bathroom

28
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,230
<2-3,Joey>我不知道怎么回答  只好说是我的
<2-3,Joey>and I didn't know what to say, so I said it was mine

29
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,370
<2-3,Joey>我要扮演一个女人
<2-3,Joey>and-and that I was playing a woman in a play.

30
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:46,120
<2-3,Joey>结果还得一不做二不休
<2-3,Joey>And one thing led to another and

31
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:54,700
<2-4,Monica>连脚踝周围都剃光了  那里很难刮
<2-4,Monica>Wow! And around the ankles, y'know that is a tough spot.

32
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:57,210
<2-5,Joey>没错  告诉你们  我不能...
<2-5,Joey>Yeah, it was! All right, listen, I can't...

33
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,450
<2-6,Chandler>我们要说谎也不好受
<2-6,Chandler>All this lying has been hard on us too.

34
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,120
<2-7,Joey>是嘛  我瞧你们上床挺享受的
<2-7,Joey>Oh-oh, yeah-yeah, I bet all the sex makes it easier!

35
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,670
<2-8,Chandler>那倒是
<2-8,Chandler>Well, yeah actually.

36
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,570
<2-9,Monica>我们以后一定会更小心的
<2-9,Monica>We'll try to be more careful okay?

37
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,650
<2-9,Monica>只是  我们不想告诉大家
<2-9,Monica>It's just that, we don't want everyone to know

38
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:13,400
<2-9,Monica>因为我们实在太甜蜜了
<2-9,Monica>because this is going really well,

39
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:16,530
<2-9,Monica>有可能就是保密才能这么顺利
<2-9,Monica>and maybe the reason it's going really well is because it's a secret.

40
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,200
<2-10,Chandler>我知道听起来很怪
<2-10,Chandler>I know it sounds really weird,

41
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,520
<2-10,Chandler>但我们都不太会处理感情问题
<2-10,Chandler>but we're just so bad at relationships.

42
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:21,720
<2-11,Monica>没错  帮帮忙
<2-11,Monica>We are! Help us!

43
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:22,610
<2-12,Chandler>拜托
<2-12,Chandler>Help!

44
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:28,390
<2-13,Joey>好吧  不过你要跟我上床一次
<2-13,Joey>All right! But,  you do it with me once.

45
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:33,680
<2-14,Monica>乔伊
<2-14,Monica>Joey!

00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,310
<2-15,Joey>就知道你不肯

<3-26,Phoebe>You gotta scare people off.

101
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,840
<3-26,Phoebe>这是我在街头流浪时学到的
<3-26,Phoebe>I learned that living on the street.

102
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:27,660
<3-27,Ross>是嘛  你会怎么说  菲比
<3-27,Ross>Really?! So what would you say Pheebs?

103
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:31,570
<3-27,Ross>是不是说  脏爪子少碰我的饭饭
<3-27,Ross>Stuff like uh, "Keep your mitts off my grub?"

104
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,510
<3-28,Chandler>罗斯  你以为菲比在街上演
<3-28,Chandler>Say Ross, when you picture Phoebe living on the street,

105
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,840
<3-28,Chandler>《孤女安妮》吗
<3-28,Chandler>is she surrounded by the entire cast of Annie?

106
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:42,540
<3-29,Phoebe>放上这张纸条就没人敢偷吃了
<3-29,Phoebe>Okay, this will keep them away from your stuff.

107
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,920
<3-31,Monica>菲比  你真狠
<3-31,Monica>Phoebe, you are a bad ass!

108
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:56,080
<3-32,Phoebe>下次再告诉你们  我拿刀捅条子的事
<3-32,Phoebe>Someday I'll tell you about the time I stabbed the cop.

109
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:58,630
<3-32,Phoebe>-菲比  -是他先捅我的
<3-32,Phoebe>- Phoebe? - Well, he stabbed me first!!

110
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:06,790
<3-32,Phoebe>勃朗特姐妹是那个时代的杰出女性
<3-32,Phoebe>The Brontie sisters were really remarkable women for their time.

111
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:08,830
<3-32,Phoebe>她们生活在男权社会
<3-32,Phoebe>They lived in a patriarchal society.

112
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:11,650
<4-1,Rachel>抱歉我迟到了  因为我太晚出门
<4-1,Rachel>Sorry I'm late, but I left late.

113
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:12,990
<4-2,Phoebe>好吧
<4-2,Phoebe>Okay.

114
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,700
<4-3,Rachel>菲比  这本书讲什么的
<4-3,Rachel>So Pheebs, what is the book about?

115
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,320
<4-4,Phoebe>你不是高中时看过吗
<4-4,Phoebe>I thought you said you read it in high school.

116
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:20,430
<4-5,Rachel>后来我想起来  我当时尝试去看
<4-5,Rachel>Well yeah, but then I remembered I started it

117
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,760
<4-5,Rachel>正好碰上啦啦队有活动
<4-5,Rachel>and there was this pep rally and I was,

118
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:24,980
<4-5,Rachel>我又是叠罗汉队形的最上面一个  总之
<4-5,Rachel>I was on top of the pyramid but anyway-

119
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:27,100
<4-5,Rachel>这本书到底讲什么的
<4-5,Rachel>What is this book about?

120
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:31,640
<4-6,Phoebe>讲的是凯瑟琳跟希斯克利夫的爱情悲剧
<4-6,Phoebe>Okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff

121
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:35,290
<4-6,Phoebe>故事发生在英国令人毛骨悚然的荒野
<4-6,Phoebe>and umm, it takes place on like these really creepy moors in England.

122
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:39,400
<4-6,Phoebe>我想这象征着希斯克利夫性格中的野性
<4-6,Phoebe>Which I think represents the wildness of Heathcliff's character.

123
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:41,340
<4-6,Phoebe>我对象征主义很有一套
<4-6,Phoebe>I totally get symbolism.

124
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:45,780
<4-7,The Teacher>这本书的主题是什么
<4-7,The Teacher>How would you characterize the theme of this book,

125
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:48,610
<4-7,The Teacher>看看找谁  瑞秋·格林
<4-7,The Teacher>uh let's see here , Rachel Green?

126
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:57,350
<4-8,Rachel>我得说  这是一个爱情悲剧
<4-8,Rachel>Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story.

127
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,780
<4-9,The Teacher>显而易见
<4-9,The Teacher>Well, that's sort of a given,

128
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:03,200
<4-9,The Teacher>不过没错  还有人补充吗
<4-9,The Teacher>but yes. Anyone else?

129
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,120
<4-10,Rachel>还有  象征主义
<4-10,Rachel>Oh-oh-oh, symbolism!

130
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:10,660
<4-10,Rachel>荒野的环境
<4-10,Rachel>And uh, the-the uh, wildness of the moors,

131
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:13,110
<4-10,Rachel>我认为反映了

185
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,480
<7-4,Joey>这样才能解释内裤  摄像机
<7-4,Joey>That's the only way to explain the underwear and the video camera

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,120
<7-5,Chandler>告诉他们你必须拍黄片
<7-5,Chandler>You can tell them you had to make an adult film

189
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:03,950
<7-5,Chandler>因为你在上黄片课
<7-5,Chandler>for your...adult film class.

<7-7,Chandler>不知道
<7-7,Chandler>Oh-I don't know.

209
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:09,270
<8-8,Ross>你不懂  其实是误会
<8-8,Ross>Oh no, you-you don't understand.

210
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,230

<8-8,Ross>Ugh, this is so silly.

211
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:14,470
<8-8,Ross>一切要从我的三明治说起
<8-8,Ross>Umm, this is all because of a sandwich.

212
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:16,720
<8-9,Dr. Leedbetter>三明治

00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:29,350
<8-10,Ross>我称之为"多汁大帝"
<8-10,Ross>I call it the Moist Maker.

218
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:33,260
<8-10,Ross>有一次我把三明治放在冰箱
<8-10,Ross>Anyway, I-I put my sandwich in the fridge over here...

219
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:35,700
<8-11,Dr. Leedbetter>-你知道吗  -什么
<8-11,Dr. Leedbetter>- Oh, you know what? - What?

<8-15,Dr. Leedbetter>我一时看错  谁都可能拿错
<8-15,Dr. Leedbetter>It was a simple mistake. It could happen to anyone.

223
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:49,370
<8-16,Ross>是吗

<8-16,Ross>Did you confuse it

225
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:56,720
<8-16,Ross>火鸡三明治也有"多汁大帝"吗
<8-16,Ross>with your own turkey sandwich with a Moist Maker?

226
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,040
<8-17,Dr. Leedbetter>没有
<8-17,Dr. Leedbetter>No.

227

<8-18,Ross>Do you perhaps remember

228
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:04,330
<8-18,Ross>上面有张字条
<8-18,Ross>seeing a note on top of it?

229
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:08,760
<8-19,Dr. Leedbetter>我以为那是有人开玩笑或是打油诗
<8-19,Dr. Leedbetter>There may have been a-a joke or a limerick of some kind.

230
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:12,720
<8-20,Ross>上面写着  那是我的三明治
<8-20,Ross>That said it was my sandwich?!

231
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,120
<8-21,Dr. Leedbetter>你别激动
<8-21,Dr. Leedbetter>Now-now calm down.

<11-10,Phoebe>你会以为她是女人  其实不然
<11-10,Phoebe>you'd think she's a woman, but she's not.

249
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,490
<11-10,Phoebe>她是生化人
<11-10,Phoebe>She's a cyborg.

250
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,570
<11-11,Rachel>生化人  就是机器人吗
<11-11,Rachel>A cyborg?! Isn't that like a robot?!

251
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:16,460
<11-12,Phoebe>这本书在当时超级先进
<11-12,Phoebe>Yeah, this book was light years ahead of its time.

252
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:20,950
<11-13,The Teacher>抱歉我迟到了  开始上课吧
<11-13,The Teacher>Sorry I'm late. Let's get started.

253
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,990
<11-13,The Teacher>大家对《简·爱》有何感想
<11-13,The Teacher>So, what did everybody think about Jane Eyre?

254
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,510
<11-14,Phoebe>瑞秋刚跟我讨论过
<11-14,Phoebe>Umm, Rachel and I were just discussing it

255
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,540
<11-14,Phoebe>她有些非常有趣的见解
<11-14,Phoebe>and she actually had some very interesting insights.

256
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,460
<11-15,The Teacher>请说  瑞秋
<11-15,The Teacher>Well, go ahead Rachel.

257
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,760
<11-16,Rachel>谢谢你  菲比
<11-16,Rachel>Uh, thank you Phoebe.

258
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:39,820
<11-16,Rachel>《简·爱》最让我震惊的就是
<11-16,Rachel>Umm, well, what struck me most when reading Jane Eyre

259
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:43,790
<11-16,Rachel>这本书领先于它的时代
<11-16,Rachel>was uh, how the book was so ahead of its time.

260
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:47,340
<11-17,The Teacher>如果你指的是女权主义  这么说也对
<11-17,The Teacher>If you're talking about feminism, I think you're right.

261
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:53,090
<11-18,Rachel>当然有女权主义  不过还有机器人
<11-18,Rachel>Yeah, well, feminism yes, but also the robots.

262
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:03,780
<12-2,Monica>既然上次咱们的小电影没拍成
<12-2,Monica>Okay, so umm, since that video camera thing didn't work out

263
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:09,220
<12-2,Monica>我就先给你来点预告片好了
<12-2,Monica>uh, I thought that I would give you just a little preview.

264
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,140
<12-3,Chandler>你没穿衣服
<12-3,Chandler>You're naked in this picture!

265
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:13,050
<12-4,Monica>我知道
<12-4,Monica>I know.

266
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,310
<12-5,Chandler>罗斯
<12-5,Chandler>Ross.

267
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:29,140
<12-6,Ross>钱德勒
<12-6,Ross>Chandler.

268
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:31,320
<12-6,Ross>莫妮卡
<12-6,Ross>Monica.

269
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,650
<12-7,Monica>罗斯  你没事吧
<12-7,Monica>Ross, are you okay?

270
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:37,650
<12-8,Ross>我很好  今天上班时去看过精神科医生
<12-8,Ross>I'm fine! I saw a psychiatrist at work today.

271
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,380
<12-9,Monica>为什么
<12-9,Monica>Why?!

272
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:41,280
<12-10,Ross>因为我脾气太暴躁
<12-10,Ross>On account of my rage.

273
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:45,460
<12-11,Chandler>而且最近越来越严重
<12-11,Chandler>Which I may say, right now, is out of control.

274
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,090
<12-12,Ross>他让我吃了药
<12-12,Ross>He gave me a pill for it.

275
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,720
<12-13,Monica>-吃药  -是啊
<12-13,Monica>- A pill? - Uh-huh.

276
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:56,420
<12-14,Ross>当医生说我应该请假
<12-14,Ross>Well, when the psychiatrist told me I had to take a leave of absence

277
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:58,290
<12-14,Ross>因为我对上司大吼大叫时
<12-14,Ross>because I yelled at my boss

278
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,930
<12-14,Ross>我又开始暴跳如雷
<12-14,Ross>I started to get worked up again,

279
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,230
<12-14,Ross>所以他要我吃颗镇定药
<12-14,Ross>so he offered me a tranquilizer.

280
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:07,470
<12-14,Ross>我觉得这主意不错  所以就吃了
<12-14,Ross>And I thought was a good idea so, I took it.

281
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:12,630
<12-15,Monica>等等  他们逼你请假吗
<12-15,Monica>Wait a minute, they're making you take time off work?

282
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,470
<12-16,Chandler>而且你也同意吗
<12-16,Chandler>And you're okay with that?

283
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:19,120
<12-17,Ross>我不知道  不工作的话刚开始可能不习惯
<12-17,Ross>I don't know. It's going to be weird not having a job for a while,

284
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:22,610
<12-17,Ross>不过我已经不在乎三明治了
<12-17,Ross>but I, I definitely don't care about my sandwich.

285
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:27,410
<13-1,Rachel>丢死人了
<13-1,Rachel>Ugh, that was so embarrassing!

286
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:30,370
<13-1,Rachel>你竟然还让我不停地说下去
<13-1,Rachel>I can't believe you let me go on and on like that!

287
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:31,910
<13-1,Rachel>对不起
<13-1,Rachel>I'm sorry.

288
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:38,160
<13-2,Phoebe>你把简·爱与机械战警作比较实在太好笑了
<13-2,Phoebe>It was just so funny when you started comparing Jane Eyre to Robocop.

289
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,500
<13-3,Rachel>一点也不好笑
<13-3,Rachel>That was not funny!

290
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:46,270
<13-4,Phoebe>我太生气了  你根本不想好好上课
<13-4,Phoebe>Well, I snapped! Okay? You weren't taking the class seriously.

291
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,640
<13-5,Rachel>菲比  拜托  这有什么了不起的
<13-5,Rachel>Phoebe, come on! What is the big deal?

292
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:51,050
<13-5,Rachel>我以为我们就是一起出去
<13-5,Rachel>I thought this was going to be something we could do together!

293
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,230
<13-5,Rachel>上课打发时间闹着玩
<13-5,Rachel>Y'know, I thought it would be fun!

294
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,960
<13-6,Phoebe>好玩很重要  但是我也想学点东西
<13-6,Phoebe>Well, yeah! Fun is good, but y'know I also wanted to learn.

295
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:58,360
<13-6,Phoebe>大家老说在高中
<13-6,Phoebe>Y'know, people are always talking about

296
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:01,460
<13-6,Phoebe>学东学西  我却没上过高中
<13-6,Phoebe>what they learned in high school and I never went to high school.

297
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:06,520
<13-7,Rachel>所以你真心想上课
<13-7,Rachel>Oh, so you really wanted to learn.

298
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:11,140
<13-7,Rachel>你知道吗  菲比  我只想找点乐子
<13-7,Rachel>Yeah, y'know, Pheebs I just wanted to have fun.

299
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,300
<13-7,Rachel>你知道你该拉谁去吗
<13-7,Rachel>Ohh, you know who you should go with?

300
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:15,920
<14-1,Monica>我知道...
<14-1,Monica>I know! I know! I know!

301
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:20,920
<14-2,The Teacher>莫妮卡  这问题是你问的
<14-2,The Teacher>Monica, you asked the question.

302
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,980
<15-1,Rachel>天啊  这是莫妮卡
<15-1,Rachel>Oh my God! That's Monica!!

305
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,760
<15-4,Ross>怎么啦
<15-4,Ross>What's going on?

306
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:53,710
<15-5,Rachel>乔伊有个秘密偷窥孔
<15-5,Rachel>Joey has got a secret peephole!

307
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:57,310
<15-2,Joey>不不不

<15-7,Rachel>He takes naked pictures of us!

310
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:02,640
<15-7,Rachel>还一边吃鸡块一边看
<15-7,Rachel>And then he eats chicken and looks at them!

311
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,390
<15-8,Rachel>看
<15-8,Rachel>Look!

<15-11,Phoebe>All right, wait! Just wait. Everybody just calm down. Okay?

315
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,460
<15-11,Phoebe>要给我们的老友乔伊一个机会
<15-11,Phoebe>Let's give our friend Joey a chance

316
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,800
<15-11,Phoebe>解释他为何如此变态
<15-11,Phoebe>to explain why he's such a big pervert!

317
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:21,350
<15-12,Joey>我不是变态  好吗
<15-12,Joey>No! I am  a pervert! Okay?

318
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,380

00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:27,980
<15-13,Chandler>我可以帮他解释
<15-13,Chandler>All right, look! Look. I think I can explain this.

320
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,480
<15-14,Joey>谢谢
<15-14,Joey>Thank you!

321
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:32,150
<15-15,Chandler>乔伊是性爱狂
<15-15,Chandler>Joey's a sex addict.

322
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,790
<15-16,Joey>什么  不  我不是
<15-16,Joey>What?!!  No I'm not!!

323
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,770
<15-17,Monica>没关系  很好  很好
<15-17,Monica>It's okay! It's good! It's good.

324
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:41,610
<15-17,Monica>这是一种病
<15-17,Monica>It's a disease!

325
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,680
<15-18,Joey>不  我才不是性爱狂
<15-18,Joey>No! No! I am not a sex addict!

326
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:46,490
<15-19,Monica>你明明就是
<15-19,Monica>Yes you are!

327
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:49,770
<15-19,Monica>这才能解释最近这一连串的事
<15-19,Monica>That's the only way to explain all this stuff!

328
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,380
<15-20,Joey>不  事实不是这样
<15-20,Joey>No it isn't! No, it's not.

329
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,810
<15-20,Joey>你也可以说出真相
<15-20,Joey>Because you can also explain it with the truth!

330
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,690
<15-21,Rachel>什么真相
<15-21,Rachel>Well, what is the truth?

331
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,820
<15-22,Ross>-怎么回事  -到底怎么了
<15-22,Ross>- Yeah, what's going on? - What's going on?

332
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:06,460
<15-24,Joey>我跟莫妮卡上床了
<15-24,Joey>I slept with Monica.

333
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:15,990
<15-25,Chandler>听听大家怎么说
<15-25,Chandler>Well let's....let's see what everybody thinks of that?

334
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:20,930
<15-26,Monica>天啊
<15-26,Monica>Oh no!

335
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:23,360
<15-27,Ross>你跟我老妹上床了
<15-27,Ross>You slept with my sister?

336
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:29,090
<15-28,Joey>对  不过只在伦敦发生过一次
<15-28,Joey>Uh yes, but it was, we just did it once uh, in London.

337
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,360
<15-29,Ross>这会让我开始抓狂
<15-29,Ross>This is not good for my rage.

338
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:38,180
<15-30,Rachel>莫妮卡  这是真的吗
<15-30,Rachel>Monica, is this true?

339
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:39,360
<15-31,Joey>当然是真的
<15-31,Joey>Of course it's true!

340
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:43,790
<15-31,Joey>否则怎么解释最近这些怪事呢
<15-31,Joey>How else would you explain all the weird stuff that's been going on?

341
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,500
<15-32,Monica>对  是真的
<15-32,Monica>Yes it's true.

342
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,110
<15-33,Rachel>如果只发生过一次
<15-33,Rachel>Okay, but if it only happened that one time,

343
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,530
<15-33,Rachel>你的内裤怎么会出现在我们家
<15-33,Rachel>how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day?

344
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,830
<15-34,Joey>那条内裤是我那天在伦敦穿的
<15-34,Joey>That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London.

345
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,970
<15-34,Joey>对不对  莫妮卡
<15-34,Joey>Right Monica?

346
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:09,180
<15-35,Monica>我想留下来  当纪念品
<15-35,Monica>I guess I wanted to keep it  as a souvenir.

347
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,240
<15-36,Ross>天啊  莫妮卡
<15-36,Ross>My God Monica!!

348
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,670
<15-37,Chandler>你确定吗  乔伊
<15-37,Chandler>Are you sure Joe?

349
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:17,860
<15-37,Chandler>你确定你不是性爱狂吗
<15-37,Chandler>Are you sure you're not just a sex addict?

350
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,990
<15-38,Joey>不是  要是有人是性爱狂
<15-38,Joey>No! If anyone's a sex addict here,

351
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:25,020
<15-38,Joey>那也是莫妮卡  没错
<15-38,Joey>it's Monica! Yeah. Yeah.

352
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:28,060
<15-38,Joey>打从伦敦回来后  她就想再勾引我上床
<15-38,Joey>She has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since London!

353
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,690
<15-39,Phoebe>所以她才拍裸照给你
<15-39,Phoebe>So that's why she gave you a naked picture of herself.

354
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:33,990
<15-40,Joey>这样说得通
<15-40,Joey>That makes sense!

355
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:39,030
<15-41,Rachel>-摄像机呢  -莫妮卡你说
<15-41,Rachel>- And the video camera? - Uhh, Monica?

356
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:45,770
<15-43,Monica>我架好摄像机是为了引诱乔伊上钩
<15-43,Monica>I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey.

357
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:50,050
<15-44,Joey>可惜我不吃这套
<15-44,Joey>But sadly I could not be enticed.

358
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:56,630
<15-45,Ross>难以置信  你还真留下了乔伊的内裤吗
<15-45,Ross>Unbelievable! I mean you really kept Joey's underwear?!

359
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,100
<15-45,Ross>为什么  你为什么这么做
<15-45,Ross>Why? Why would you do that?!
