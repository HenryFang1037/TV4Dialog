<4-4,Ross>那不重要

00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,340
<4-8,Chandler>别让她有那些念头
<4-8,Chandler>I don't want you putting any ideas in her head.

<8-14,Steve>because Phoebe's more our kind of people.

244
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:51,460
<8-14,Steve>你考虑一下
<8-14,Steve>Something to think about.

245
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,930
<8-15,Phoebe>是我不好
<8-15,Phoebe>Yeah, okay, my bad.

246
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,330
<9-2,Rachel>哇  你看起来好壮
<9-2,Rachel>Wow! You look, you look...big.

00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,860
<9-3,Joey>谢谢  最近我有健身
<9-3,Joey>Thanks! I've been working out.

248
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:20,370
<9-3,Joey>看得出来我穿了六件毛衣吗
<9-3,Joey>Hey listen, is it obvious that I'm wearing six sweaters?

249
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:25,610
<9-4,Rachel>看得出来  但看不出来为什么
<9-4,Rachel>Uhhh, yeah. But it's not obvious why.

250
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,190
<9-5,Joey>我要跟凯蒂分手
<9-5,Joey>Well look, I'm breaking up with Katie

251
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,070
<9-5,Joey>所以得多加几层防护
<9-5,Joey>so I had to put on some extra padding.

252
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,610
<9-5,Joey>她平常高兴就会打我
<9-5,Joey>Y'know? I mean, if she hits me when she's happy,

253
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,620
<9-5,Joey>现在我要收回乔伊之爱
<9-5,Joey>can you imagine how hard she's gonna hit me

254
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:36,560
<9-5,Joey>她岂不是打得更用力吗
<9-5,Joey>when I tell her I'm taking away the Joey love?

255
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,600
<9-8,Rachel>好可爱的外套
<9-8,Rachel>Hey! Hey, cute jacket!

<9-10,Rachel>是乔伊要你叫痛的吗
<9-10,Rachel>Oh, ow! Did Joey tell you to say that?

258
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,090
<9-11,Katie>你们真是够了
<9-11,Katie>You guys, are too much!

00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,280
<9-13,Katie>乔伊的朋友真棒
<9-13,Katie>Ohh, Joey has the nicest friends!

00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:27,480
<9-17,Katie>乔伊  她踢我
<9-17,Katie>Joey, she just kicked me.

266
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:35,400
<9-18,Joey>你不替我出头吗
<9-18,Joey>Well? Aren't you gonna do something?

267
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:37,830
<9-20,Joey>你最好替我出头
<9-20,Joey>You'd better do something,

268
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:39,860
<9-21,Katie>否则我现在就走人
<9-21,Katie>or I'm gonna walk out that door right now!

269
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,360
<9-21,Katie>你快行动啊

00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,040
<10-2,Phoebe>菲比
<10-2,Phoebe>Phoebe.

272
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,660
<10-3,Ross>菲比  菲比
<10-3,Ross>Phoebe, Phoebe.

273
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:08,720
<10-5,Ross>这真是人间地狱  我要走了
<10-5,Ross>Look, this is a disaster! Can't I please just go?

274
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:10,690
<10-6,Phoebe>不行  我正在帮你说好话
<10-6,Phoebe>No! No! I'm talking you up to people.

275
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,330
<10-6,Phoebe>再等一下下
<10-6,Phoebe>Just give it a little time, all right?

276
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,910
<10-6,Phoebe>放轻松  吃点东西  好吗
<10-6,Phoebe>Relax, get something to eat! Okay?

277
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,930
<10-7,Ross>你跟他们说了我什么
<10-7,Ross>So uh, what did you tell them about me?

278
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,480
<10-8,Phoebe>我说了你和艾蜜莉的事
<10-8,Phoebe>Oh, I was telling them about you and Emily.

279
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:23,990
<10-8,Phoebe>好争取同情心
<10-8,Phoebe>Y'know, try to get some sympathy.

280
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:26,580
<10-10,Phoebe>但讲一讲你成了坏人
<10-10,Phoebe>But somehow you came off as the bad guy.

281
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,180
<10-11,Ross>什么
<10-11,Ross>What?!

282
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:30,060
<10-12,Phoebe>我想我说的方式不对
<10-12,Phoebe>Yeah, I think I told it wrong.

283
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,720
<10-12,Phoebe>我们应该先聊聊
<10-12,Phoebe>Y'know, we should talk about that

284
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:34,950
<10-12,Phoebe>我不太知道前因后果
<10-12,Phoebe>because I don't totally understand what happened there.

285
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:40,120
<10-13,Ross>这个蛋糕真好吃
<10-13,Ross>Ohh, this cake is really good!

286
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:42,270
<10-14,Phoebe>看吧  情况已经在好转了
<10-14,Phoebe>Oh, okay, see? Things are looking up already!

287
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,800
<10-16,All>天哪  有人切了霍华德的蛋糕
<10-16,All>Oh my God! Someone cut Howard's cake!

288
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:51,800
<10-17,Steve>谁会做这种低级的事
<10-17,Steve>Who would do a think like that?

289
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,540
<10-19,Steve>3-B房
<10-19,Steve>3-B!

290
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:04,990
<10-17,Steve>你白吃白喝  扫了大家的兴
<10-17,Steve>Okay, you got your free food! You ruined everyone's fun!

291
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,830
<10-17,Steve>是不是该回家了
<10-17,Steve>Don't you think it's time you went home?!

292
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,840
<10-18,All>快走
<10-18,All>Yeah, leave!

293
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:11,160
<10-19,Steve>滚回3-B去  3-B
<10-19,Steve>Go back to 3-B, 3-B!

294
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:14,940
<10-20,Phoebe>大家冷静一下  冷静下
<10-20,Phoebe>All right, everyone calm down! Everyone calm down!

295
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:17,280
<10-20,Phoebe>我有话要说
<10-20,Phoebe>I have something that I would like to say!

296
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,520
<10-20,Phoebe>这里有谁喜欢罗斯
<10-20,Phoebe>Who here likes Ross?

297
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,750
<10-20,Phoebe>你们当然不喜欢他
<10-20,Phoebe>Of course you don't like him!

298
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,230
<10-20,Phoebe>他不交钱
<10-20,Phoebe>He-he didn't give you any money,

299
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,800
<10-20,Phoebe>我问有谁喜欢他  他自己举手
<10-20,Phoebe>he raised his own hand when I asked, "Who hear likes Ross,"

300
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:36,150
<10-20,Phoebe>他还贴两个姓名牌
<10-20,Phoebe>and he's wearing two nametags!

301
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:42,060
<10-20,Phoebe>老实说  刚开始认识罗斯时
<10-20,Phoebe>I-I'll be honest with you guys, when I first met Ross

302
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,460
<10-20,Phoebe>我一点也不喜欢他
<10-20,Phoebe>I didn't like him at all!

303
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,870
<10-20,Phoebe>但后来了解他后
<10-20,Phoebe>But then once I got to know him

304
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,040
<10-20,Phoebe>我就发现他很好
<10-20,Phoebe>I saw that he's really sweet

305
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,120
<10-20,Phoebe>很关心人  很大方
<10-20,Phoebe>and caring and very generous.

306
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:54,770
<10-20,Phoebe>请不要在还不了解他时
<10-20,Phoebe>I mean, all I'm saying is don't judge Ross

307
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,540
<10-20,Phoebe>就断定他的人品
<10-20,Phoebe>before you get to know him all right?

308
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:59,250
<10-20,Phoebe>我现在很喜欢你们
<10-20,Phoebe>I mean, I like all you guys now,

309
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:02,270
<10-20,Phoebe>但是刚见面时  寇特
<10-20,Phoebe>but when I first meet you y'know Kurt

310
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,220
<10-20,Phoebe>我觉得你是讨厌的酒鬼
<10-20,Phoebe>I thought, y'know abrasive drunk,

311
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:10,240
<10-20,Phoebe>萝拉  笨得令人傻眼
<10-20,Phoebe>umm Lola, mind numbingly stupid!

312
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:16,160
<10-20,Phoebe>还有你们  拜金女配老牛吃嫩草的变态
<10-20,Phoebe>And okay, you guys Gold-digger, cradle robbing perv!

313
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,120
<10-20,Phoebe>你们懂我的意思了吧
<10-20,Phoebe>So, I think you all know what I mean.

314
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:31,210
<11-1,Phoebe>我没想到他们会冲咱们扔东西
<11-1,Phoebe>Obviously I didn't think they were gonna start throwing things.

315
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,580
<11-1,Phoebe>我只是想我一直羞辱他们
<11-1,Phoebe>I just thought if I kept insulting everyone,

316
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:36,340
<11-1,Phoebe>你就会跳出来帮他们
<11-1,Phoebe>you would jump in and defend everyone

317
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:38,200
<11-1,Phoebe>那就可以变成英雄啦
<11-1,Phoebe>and then you could look like the hero.

318
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:42,650
<11-2,Ross>哇  是啊  太深奥了我不明白
<11-2,Ross>Oh wow, yeah! See, I did not get that.

319
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,470
<11-2,Ross>莫妮卡呢  她在哪里  我有话跟她说
<11-2,Ross>Where's Monica?! Where is she? I need to talk to her!

320
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,820
<12-1,Chandler>我有急事  她在吗
<12-1,Chandler>It's urgent! Is she here?

321
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,210
<12-2,Monica>我就是莫妮卡
<12-2,Monica>I'm Monica.

322
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,680
<12-3,Chandler>我有急事要跟你说
<12-3,Chandler>I need to talk to you, it's urgent!

323
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,500
<12-4,Monica>我想了很多我们的事
<12-4,Monica>Okay, I've been doing a lot of thinking about us,

324
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:00,990
<12-5,Chandler>想了你和我的事
<12-5,Chandler>y'know a lot of uhh, us thinking.

325
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:05,700
<12-5,Chandler>我猜只有一个办法
<12-5,Chandler>And uh, well I guess there's only one-one way to do this.

326
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:12,170
<12-6,Monica>你要干什么
<12-6,Monica>Wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing?!

327
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:12,720
<12-7,Chandler>莫妮卡
<12-7,Chandler>Monica...

328
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:14,590
<12-8,Monica>拜托不要
<12-8,Monica>No-no, don't-don't-don't do it!

329
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:17,690
<12-9,Chandler>你愿意嫁给我吗
<12-9,Chandler>Will you marry me?

330
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,500
<12-11,Joey>什么馊主意
<12-11,Joey>What a bad idea!

331
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:24,220
<12-12,Rachel>我不敢看
<12-12,Rachel>Ohhhh, I cannot look at it!

332
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,720
<12-13,Monica>钱德勒  你为什么要这样
<12-13,Monica>Chandler, why are you doing this?

333
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:33,560
<12-14,Chandler>我不知道  但我知道我不怕做这个
<12-14,Chandler>I don't know. But I know I'm not afraid to do this.

334
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,030
<12-15,Monica>钱德勒
<12-15,Monica>Chandler.

335
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,780
<12-16,Chandler>因为我很抱歉吗
<12-16,Chandler>I'm doing this because I'm sorry?

336
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:42,270
<12-17,Monica>你真的觉得
<12-17,Monica>Do you umm, you really think

337
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,720
<12-17,Monica>结婚的最好理由是因为你很抱歉吗
<12-17,Monica>the best reason to get married is because you're sorry?

338
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:46,960
<12-18,Chandler>不  最好的理由是奉子成婚
<12-18,Chandler>No, the best reason to get married is pregnancy.

339
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,120
<12-18,Chandler>"抱歉"大约排第四
<12-18,Chandler>Sorry is pretty much fourth y'know,

340
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:54,850
<12-18,Chandler>排在"准备好了"和"真的想结婚"后面
<12-18,Chandler>behind being ready and actually wanting to get married.

341
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,500
<12-18,Chandler>你愿意做我的妻子吗
<12-18,Chandler>Will you be my wife?

342
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:03,010
<12-19,Monica>钱德勒  你先静下来想想
<12-19,Monica>Chandler, umm, I want you to take just a minute

343
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:06,060
<12-19,Monica>这件事有多荒谬
<12-19,Monica>and I want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds.

344
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,040
<12-20,Chandler>我的确有点希望他们都不在
<12-20,Chandler>Yeah, I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now.

345
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:17,440
<12-21,Monica>亲爱的  这些事都不是我扯出来的
<12-21,Monica>Honey! Do you know that none of that stuff came from me?!

346
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:21,150
<12-21,Monica>我从来没说现在就想结婚生子
<12-21,Monica>I mean I never said I wanted to have babies and get married right now!

347
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,700
<12-22,Chandler>但我真的很乱
<12-22,Chandler>Yeah I know, but I was really confused

348
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,460
<12-22,Chandler>后来又跟他们谈过
<12-22,Chandler>and then I talked to these guys.

349
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,960
<12-23,Monica>离婚两次的人和乔伊
<12-23,Monica>Who? Two divorces and Joey?!

350
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,060
<12-25,Joey>她说得对
<12-25,Joey>She's right y'know.

351
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:34,690
<12-26,Ross>但这种奚落算什么
<12-26,Ross>Yeah, but still, cheap shot!

352
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:40,010
<12-27,Monica>你知道吗  我不是要你
<12-27,Monica>Y'know what? Y'know when I said that I want you to

353
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:42,710
<12-27,Monica>自己想该怎么做吗
<12-27,Monica>deal with this relationship stuff all on your own?

354
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:45,120
<12-27,Monica>你还做不到这一点
<12-27,Monica>Well, you're not ready for that.

355
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:46,660
<12-28,Chandler>我也这么认为
<12-28,Chandler>I didn't think I was!

356
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:56,460
<12-29,Monica>天哪  要是我答应了呢
