00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,580
<7-1,Chandler>魔法之旅就启程了吗

<7-2,Ross>她给我留言说  还想再跟我约会
<7-2,Ross>but she actually left me a message saying she'd like to go out again.

159
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:09,570
<7-4,Ross>我正要打电话给她
<7-4,Ross>In fact, I'll go call her right now.

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,680
<7-18,Ross>但我刚刚发现她也在跟别人约会
<7-18,Ross>But I just found out she's also seeing some other guy.

174
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,410
<7-18,Ross>真的吗
<7-18,Ross>Really?

175
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:02,860
<7-19,Chandler>乔伊  如果你是罗斯  你会怎么做
<7-19,Chandler>Joe, what would you do if you were in Ross' situation?

176
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,840
<7-19,Chandler>我跟他情况差不多
<7-19,Chandler>I sort of am.

<7-20,Joey>跟我约会的姑娘也在跟别人约会
<7-20,Joey>I'm dating this girl who's also seeing another guy.

178
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:09,440
<7-20,Joey>但我一点都不担心
<7-20,Joey>But I'm not worried about it.

179
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:11,040
<7-20,Joey>你不必担心
<7-20,Joey>You shouldn't be.

180
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,270
<7-21,Ross>我可不想当你的竞争者
<7-21,Ross>Believe me, I wouldn't want to be the guy who's up against you.

181
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:19,430
<7-21,Ross>那个蠢蛋一定会输给你的
<7-21,Ross>I mean, that doofus is going to lose.

182
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:24,030
<7-21,Ross>这真的太有意思了
<7-21,Ross>So this is nice.

183
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:29,930
<7-22,Chandler>真希望我能留下来  相信我
<7-22,Chandler>I wish I didn't have to go. Believe me.

00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:32,400
<7-22,Chandler>但可惜我得走了
<7-22,Chandler>But unfortunately I have to.

185
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:34,930
<7-22,Chandler>对了  跟你们约会的姑娘叫什么名字
<7-22,Chandler>By the way, what's the name of the girl you're dating?

186
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:37,270
<7-22,Chandler>-克丽丝汀·莱夫  -再见
<7-22,Chandler>- Kristen Leigh. - Bye.

187
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,410
<8-1,Ross>很明显  我们之中只有一个人
<8-1,Ross>Well, obviously only one of us

188
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:49,100
<8-1,Ross>可以继续跟她约会
<8-1,Ross>can keep dating her.

189
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:52,500
<8-2,Joey>没错  我们该怎么决定
<8-2,Joey>Obviously. So how do we decide?

190
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:56,250
<8-3,Ross>好了  我们得客观地来解决这件事
<8-3,Ross>Well, now, let's look at this objectively.

191
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:58,830
<8-3,Ross>我觉得我该跟她约会
<8-3,Ross>I think I should date her.

192
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:05,380
<8-4,Joey>或是我该跟她约会
<8-4,Joey>Or I'm the one who dates her.

193
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:09,870
<8-5,Ross>真有意思  但听好了 我跟她约会
<8-5,Ross>That's interesting. But check this out. I date her.

194
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,570
<8-6,Joey>好吧  但换个角度来说...
<8-6,Joey>Yeah, I like that but just to go in another direction...

195
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:16,640
<8-7,Ross>好吧  我们是讨论不出结果的
<8-7,Ross>Okay. This can go on for a while.

196
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:19,200
<8-8,Joey>-那么我们该点些吃的  -不  乔伊
<8-8,Joey>- We should order some food, then. - No, Joey.

197
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:24,810
<8-9,Ross>我们何不让她来决定
<8-9,Ross>Look, why don't we just let her decide, okay?

198
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:28,070
<8-9,Ross>我们都再跟她约会一次
<8-9,Ross>We'll each go out with her one more time.

199
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:30,990
<8-9,Ross>看看她比较喜欢谁
<8-9,Ross>And we'll see who she likes best.

200
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,210
<8-10,Joey>听起来很公平
<8-10,Joey>That sounds fair.

201
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:38,210
<8-11,Ross>我可能会带她到新开的法国餐厅吃饭
<8-11,Ross>Maybe I'll take her to that new French restaurant down the street.

202
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:42,340
<8-12,Joey>等一下  我们得对约会费用设下限制
<8-12,Joey>Wait a second. We have to set a spending limit on the date.

203
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:44,970
<8-12,Joey>我没钱带她到高级餐厅吃饭
<8-12,Joey>I don't have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.

204
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:48,650
<8-13,Ross>抱歉  那就是我的约会方式
<8-13,Ross>Well, sorry. That's what I do on dates.

205
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:53,390
<8-14,Joey>看来我得用我的约会方式了
<8-14,Joey>Well, I guess I'll just have to do what I do on dates.

206
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:02,450
<8-15,Ross>-我们来决定费用上限  -好吧
<8-15,Ross>- So let's decide on a spending limit. - Yeah.

207
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,430
<8-16,Joey>一片...
<8-16,Joey>And a slice...

208
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,360
<8-16,Joey>六块钱
<8-16,Joey>...$6?

209
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,430
<8-17,Ross>-我想说一百块  -好吧
<8-17,Ross>- I was thinking more like 100. - Okay.

210
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:20,000
<8-18,Joey>你能借我九十四块吗
<8-18,Joey>Can I borrow $94?

211
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,240
<9-2,Phoebe>我懂  你能帮我拿张面纸吗
<9-2,Phoebe>I know. Can you hand me a tissue?

212
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,140
<9-3,Rachel>你家没有健怡可乐了
<9-3,Rachel>You're out of Diet Coke.

213
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,680
<9-4,Monica>喂
<9-4,Monica>Hello?

214
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:50,230
<9-4,Monica>什么  你说什么
<9-4,Monica>What? You what?

215
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:52,020
<9-4,Monica>你给我听好了  小姐
<9-4,Monica>You listen here, missy!

216
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,330
<9-5,Phoebe>怎么了
<9-5,Phoebe>What?

217
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:57,240
<9-6,Monica>是梅根打来的
<9-6,Monica>That was that girl Megan.

218
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,460
<9-6,Monica>她预定了摇摆国王在我们婚礼那天演出
<9-6,Monica>She booked The Swing Kings on the day of our wedding...

219
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:02,160
<9-6,Monica>还说如果我不把婚纱让给她  就别想要回乐队
<9-6,Monica>...and said I couldn't have them back unless I gave her the dress!

220
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:06,130
<9-7,Phoebe>那么说可以请尸体了
<9-7,Phoebe>Does that mean Carcass is available?

221
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:11,860
<9-8,Monica>我该怎么办  我好喜欢那件婚纱
<9-8,Monica>What am I gonna do? That's the dress! That is the dress!

222
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:16,530
<9-8,Monica>钱德勒喜欢那个乐队  我该怎么办
<9-8,Monica>Chandler wants the band. What do I do?

223
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:20,070
<9-9,Phoebe>-想办法说服他放弃  -怎么说服
<9-9,Phoebe>- Figure out a way to talk him out of it. - How?

224
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,050
<10-1,Joey>你家的卫生纸用完了
<10-1,Joey>You're out of toilet paper!

225
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:32,860
<10-2,Ross>什么事

<10-3,Joey>我要来祝你约会顺利
<10-3,Joey>I wanted to wish you good luck on your date.

00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:38,230
<10-5,Joey>-谢谢  -你们约几点
<10-5,Joey>- Thanks. - What time are you meeting?

<10-6,Ross>我们在葛兰梅西毕斯多餐厅订了八点的位子
<10-6,Ross>We have 8:00 reservations at Grand Merci Bistro.

229
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:44,590
<10-7,Joey>只剩下二十分钟  你最好快去换衣服
<10-7,Joey>That's in 20 minutes. You'd better get dressed.

<10-8,Ross>-我已经换好衣服了  -太好了
<10-8,Ross>- I am dressed. - Oh, well, good.

231
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:51,450
<10-9,Joey>对我来说
<10-9,Joey>For me.

232
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,120
<10-9,Joey>这是什么  你在敷脸
<10-9,Joey>What's this? Did you give yourself a facial?

233
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,350
<10-10,Ross>我的T字区经常出油
<10-10,Ross>I have an oily T-zone.

234
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,420
<10-11,Joey>好吧  兄弟

<10-11,Joey>-你送了花给克丽丝汀  -没错
<10-11,Joey>- You sent Kristen flowers? - That's right.

236
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,670
<10-13,Joey>你花了一百块  你把钱花光了  你完蛋了
<10-13,Joey>You spent $ 100. That's the limit. You're screwed!

237
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,730
<10-14,Ross>我是在约会前送她花
<10-14,Ross>Actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date,

238
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:20,830
<10-14,Ross>所以严格来说
<10-14,Ross>so technically, technically...

239
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,010
<10-14,Ross>我没有犯规

00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:27,630
<10-15,Joey>你真要那么玩吗  我也可以犯规
<10-15,Joey>That's the way it's gonna be? I can break the rules too.

00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,990
<10-16,Ross>-你打算怎么办  -我不知道
<10-16,Ross>- What are you gonna do? - I don't know.

<10-19,Joey>罗斯  我不会放过你的
<10-19,Joey>Ross, I'm not gonna let you get away with this.

245
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,710
<10-20,Ross>-你拿我没什么办法  -我们走着瞧
<10-20,Ross>- I don't think you have much choice. - We'll see!

246
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:37,720
<10-22,Ross>-再见  -再见
<10-22,Ross>- Bye bye! - Bye bye.

247
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,160
<10-23,Joey>只要薄薄地敷一层就好
<10-23,Joey>Hey! So, just a light layer?

248
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,680
<10-24,Ross>对  只要敷这里跟这里
<10-24,Ross>Yeah, just here and there.

249
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:54,570
<11-1,Chandler>乔伊又把肉酱滴在栏杆上了
<11-1,Chandler>Joey got meat sauce on the banister again.

250
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:58,700
<11-2,Phoebe>摇摆音乐太落伍了
<11-2,Phoebe>Swing music is so out.

251
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:01,590
<11-3,Monica>菲比  他得在这个房间里才听得到
<11-3,Monica>Phoebe, he's gotta be in the room for that to work.

252
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,710
<11-4,Chandler>你们到底在说什么
<11-4,Chandler>What are you guys talking about?

253
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:08,260
<11-5,Monica>我们在谈摇摆国王...
<11-5,Monica>We're talking about The Swing Kings...

254
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:11,050
<11-5,Monica>讨论到底该不该请他们来
<11-5,Monica>...and wondering whether they're the right way to go.

255
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:13,900
<11-6,Rachel>有一次我去参加婚礼  请的就是摇摆乐队
<11-6,Rachel>I went to a wedding once where they had swing music...

256
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,630
<11-6,Rachel>两个月后他们就离婚了
<11-6,Rachel>...and two months later, the couple divorced.

257
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:20,550
<11-6,Rachel>我没说这其中有什么必然的联系
<11-6,Rachel>I'm not saying there's any connection here...

258
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:24,620
<11-6,Rachel>但他们告诉我就是为了乐队离的婚
<11-6,Rachel>...but they did tell me that's why they got divorced.

259
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,420
<11-7,Chandler>但我喜欢摇摆音乐
<11-7,Chandler>But I love swing music!

260
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,000
<11-7,Chandler>可摇摆国王实在不敢恭维
<11-7,Chandler>But The Swing Kings?

261
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,630
<11-8,Phoebe>他们烂到有人听他们的演唱都会送命
<11-8,Phoebe>They suck so much that people actually die at their concerts.

262
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,630
<11-8,Phoebe>他们就是活不下去了
<11-8,Phoebe>They just stop living.

263
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:40,250
<11-9,Chandler>可是莫妮卡跟我去听他们演唱会非常开心
<11-9,Chandler>All I know is that when Monica and I went to see them, we had fun.

264
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,230
<11-9,Chandler>其实还有一个原因
<11-9,Chandler>And there's another reason too.

265
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:45,640
<11-10,Rachel>-什么原因  -我不想说
<11-10,Rachel>- Well, what is the other reason? - I don't want to say.

266
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:49,500
<11-12,Rachel>你非说不可  或许这个理由很蠢
<11-12,Rachel>Well, you have to because maybe it's stupid.

267
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:54,650
<11-13,Chandler>莫妮卡跟我随着他们的音乐起舞...
<11-13,Chandler>It's just, while Monica and I were dancing to them...

268
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:58,880
<11-13,Chandler>那是我第一次知道...
<11-13,Chandler>...it was the first time I knew that...

269
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,800
<11-13,Chandler>你就是我想一辈子共舞的女人
<11-13,Chandler>...you were the woman that I wanted to dance all my dances with.

270
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,850
<11-14,Monica>烂理由
<11-14,Monica>Oh, crap.

271
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:21,130
<12-1,Ross>-我们的桌子马上就准备好  -太棒了
<12-1,Ross>- They said our table will be ready in a few minutes. - Oh, great.

272
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:24,270
<12-4,Kristen>-你的背好一点了吗  -没事了
<12-4,Kristen>- Is your back feeling better? - Yeah, that's fine.

273
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,580
<12-5,Ross>我猜肌肉越多...
<12-5,Ross>I guess the more muscles you have...

274
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:30,930
<12-5,Ross>就越容易抽筋
<12-5,Ross>...the more they can spasm out of control.

275
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:35,220
<12-8,Joey>-克丽丝汀  -乔伊
<12-8,Joey>- Kristen? - Joey!

276
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:41,500
<12-9,Kristen>-你来这里做什么  -我喜欢这家餐厅
<12-9,Kristen>- What are you doing here? - I like this place.

277
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:45,480
<12-10,Joey>严格来说  我没有犯规  所以...
<12-10,Joey>And technically, I'm not breaking any rules, so...

278
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:51,150
<12-11,Kristen>罗斯  他是乔伊  乔伊  罗斯
<12-11,Kristen>Well, Ross, this is Joey. Joey, Ross.

<12-13,Ross>我以前有个朋友也叫乔伊
<12-13,Ross>I used to have a friend named Joey.

281
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,000
<12-13,Ross>但我现在跟他绝交了
<12-13,Ross>I don't anymore.

00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:19,470
<12-17,Ross>你上过电视吗
<12-17,Ross>Are you on TV or something?

286
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:21,230
<12-18,Kristen>乔伊不喜欢提这件事...
<12-18,Kristen>Joey doesn't like to talk about it...

287
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:24,200
<12-18,Kristen>但他主演过《我们的日子》
<12-18,Kristen>...but he's one of the stars of Days of Our Lives.

288
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:29,590
<12-19,Ross>没错  你是演了个女人吗
<12-19,Ross>That's right. Don't you play a woman?

289
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,720
<12-20,Joey>一个被困在男人身体里的女人
<12-20,Joey>A woman in a man's body.

290
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,360
<12-21,Ross>这下好多了

00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,850
<12-29,Ross>之后又结了一次
<12-29,Ross>...another time after that.

<12-29,Ross>Joey, have you ever been so hungry on a date...

304
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:31,010
<12-29,Ross>趁女伴去上洗手间偷吃掉她的食物吗
<12-29,Ross>...that when the girl goes to the bathroom, you eat some of her food?

305
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:36,870
<12-30,Kristen>你说是服务生吃掉了我的蟹饼
<12-30,Kristen>You said the waiter ate my crab cake.

306
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:43,390
<12-31,Joey>罗斯  你的第一段婚姻为什么会失败
<12-31,Joey>So, Ross, now why did that first marriage break up?

307
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:48,200
<12-31,Joey>因为你前妻是异性恋  还是因为她是同性恋
<12-31,Joey>Was it because the woman was straight or because she was a lesbian?

308
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:53,330
<12-32,Kristen>-你们认识吗  -不认识
<12-32,Kristen>- Do you two know each other? - No.

309
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,840
<12-33,Joey and Ross>只是罗斯看起来像是那种
<12-33,Joey and Ross>Just seems like Ross is the kind of guy

310
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,700
<12-34,Joey>结婚之后能把半直不弯的女人
<12-34,Joey>who'd marry a woman on the verge of being a lesbian

311
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,960
<12-34,Joey>彻底掰弯的男人
<12-34,Joey>and then push her over the edge.

312
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:09,410
<12-35,Ross>等一下  你拍过性病海报吧
<12-35,Ross>Wait a minute! Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?

313
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:14,640
<12-36,Joey>你跟猴子同床共枕过吧
<12-36,Joey>Have you ever slept in the same bed with a monkey?

314
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,210
<12-37,Ross>别把马修扯进来
<12-37,Ross>You leave Marcel out of this!

315
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:22,430
<12-38,Joey>好吧  你曾经被自己的皮裤卡住过吧
<12-38,Joey>Fine! You ever gotten stuck in a pair of your own leather pants?

316
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,180
<12-39,Ross>你曾经把自己锁在电视柜里过吧   梅毒小子
<12-39,Ross>Have you ever locked yourself in a TV cabinet, VD-boy?

317
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,590
<12-40,Joey>猴子迷
<12-40,Joey>Monkey-lover!

318
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:39,640
<12-41,Joey>你觉得她是什么时候走的
<12-41,Joey>Where do you think we lost her?

319
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,910
<12-42,Ross>可能是说到性病那一段吧
<12-42,Ross>Probably around gonorrhea.

320
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,570
<13-2,Monica>-亲爱的  我回来了  -别进来
<13-2,Monica>- Hi, honey, I'm home! - Don't come in here!

321
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:58,010
<13-3,Chandler>怎么了  你的另一个男朋友在里面吗
<13-3,Chandler>Why, do you have another boyfriend in there or something?

322
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:01,090
<13-4,Monica>不  我们只会在他家胡搞
<13-4,Monica>No. We only mess around at his place.

323
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:05,010
<13-5,Chandler>虽然是我开的头  但我开始心慌了
<13-5,Chandler>It's funny that I started it, but now it's scaring me,

324
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:06,920
<13-5,Chandler>你能出来吗
<13-5,Chandler>so could you come out here, please?

325
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:09,390
<13-6,Monica>不行  我正穿着婚纱
<13-6,Monica>No, I'm wearing a wedding dress.

326
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:11,400
<13-7,Chandler>你买到婚纱了  太棒了
<13-7,Chandler>You got a wedding dress? That's great.

327
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,760
<13-8,Monica>对  但我要退回去
<13-8,Monica>Yeah, but I'm not keeping it.

328
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,340
<13-9,Chandler>那我为什么不能看
<13-9,Chandler>Then why can't I see it?

329
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,560
<13-10,Monica>应该可以
<13-10,Monica>Oh. I guess you can.

330
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:20,720
<13-10,Monica>但我得退回去  所以你绝对不能喜欢
<13-10,Monica>But I have to return it, so you can't like it.

331
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:23,220
<13-11,Chandler>好吧  我发誓我会很讨厌
<13-11,Chandler>Okay, I promise. I'll hate it.

332
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:33,390
<13-11,Chandler>哇  你看起来好丑啊
<13-11,Chandler>Wow. You look hideous.

333
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:35,670
<13-12,Monica>真的吗
<13-12,Monica>Really?

334
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:40,620
<13-13,Chandler>那是我见过最丑的婚纱
<13-13,Chandler>Yeah. That's like the most ugliest dress I've ever seen.

335
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,120
<13-13,Chandler>你为什么要退回去
<13-13,Chandler>Why do you have to return it?

336
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,340
<13-14,Monica>因为很不合身
<13-14,Monica>Because it doesn't really fit.

337
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,560
<13-14,Monica>还有  我订了摇摆国王
<13-14,Monica>Oh, by the way, I booked The Swing Kings.

338
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,130
<13-15,Chandler>太棒了  谢谢
<13-15,Chandler>Oh, that's great. Thanks.

339
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,630
<13-15,Chandler>但那件婚纱  简直丑爆了
<13-15,Chandler>But that dress... I mean it's like... It's terrible.

340
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:57,980
<13-15,Chandler>-我想把它从你身上扯下来  -好吧
<13-15,Chandler>- It makes me want to rip it off you. - Okay.

341
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:00,010
<13-16,Monica>但你不可以弄破
<13-16,Monica>But you can't rip it.

342
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,830
<13-16,Monica>弄破一点也没关系
<13-16,Monica>Well, maybe a little.

343
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:14,340
<14-1,Monica>你们想看看婚礼上的歌曲清单吗
<14-1,Monica>Guys, you want to look at the song list for the wedding?

344
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,730
<14-1,Monica>伙计们
<14-1,Monica>Guys?

345
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,340
<14-2,Chandler>我还以为你会出去一整天
<14-2,Chandler>I thought you were gonna be gone all day.

346
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:21,150
<14-3,Monica>好吧  发生了什么事
<14-3,Monica>All right, what's going on?

347
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,250
<14-4,Monica>对不起
<14-4,Monica>I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

348
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,760
<14-4,Monica>我应该让你们这些小女生独处一下
<14-4,Monica>I should probably leave you girls alone.

349
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:37,310
<14-5,Ross>尽管笑吧  但十分钟后
<14-5,Ross>Laugh all you want, but in 10 minutes,

350
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:39,750
<14-5,Ross>我们的皮肤会变得又白又嫩
<14-5,Ross>we'll have younger-looking skin.

351
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:45,360
<14-6,Joey>她也该敷一下脸
<14-6,Joey>You know, she could use a little...

352
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:49,830
<14-6,Joey>好球  太帅了
<14-6,Joey>Oh, nice shot! Yeah!
