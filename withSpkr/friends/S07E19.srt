63
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,780
<3-2,Joey>这不是部色情电影
<3-2,Joey>It's not like it's porn.

00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,260
<6-7,Ross>凯西现在长什么样子
<6-7,Ross>By the way, what does Cassie even look like now?

128
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:04,340
<6-8,Monica>跟玛丽莲姨妈一模一样
<6-8,Monica>She looks exactly like Aunt Marilyn.

129
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,270
<6-9,Chandler>玛丽莲姨妈会来参加婚礼吗
<6-9,Chandler>This Aunt Marilyn, is she coming to the wedding?

130
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:10,120
<6-10,Monica>你给我小心点
<6-10,Monica>Wafer-thin ice.

131
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:16,960
<7-1,Joey>我回来了
<7-1,Joey>Hey, I'm back.

132
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,690
<7-2,The Casting Director>乔伊
<7-2,The Casting Director>Hi, Joey.

133
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:21,620
<7-3,Joey>我要念同一场戏吗
<7-3,Joey>Will I read the same scene again?

134
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:24,740
<7-4,The Casting Director>我打过电话给你  你今天不用过来的
<7-4,The Casting Director>Actually, I tried to call you. You didn't need to come down here today.

135
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:26,470
<7-5,Joey>真好
<7-5,Joey>Oh, great.

136
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:30,080
<7-5,Joey>我是这个角色的最佳人选
<7-5,Joey>You know I'd have been perfect for this part, but whatever.

137
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,270
<7-5,Joey>你这个错误决定会毁了整部电影  再见
<7-5,Joey>Thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie! Good day!

138
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,020
<7-6,The Casting Director>乔伊  你不需要过来
<7-6,The Casting Director>Joey, you didn't need to come down,

139
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:39,150
<7-6,The Casting Director>因为导演看了你的带子非常喜欢
<7-6,The Casting Director>because the director saw your tape from yesterday and loved it.

140
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:43,370
<7-7,Joey>还有表演
<7-7,Joey>And, scene.

141
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:50,400
<7-7,Joey>很好玩吧  刚刚的即兴表演
<7-7,Joey>Wasn't that fun? We did a little improv there. Yeah!

142
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:52,850
<7-7,Joey>你刚才想说什么
<7-7,Joey>So, you were saying?

143
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:54,610
<7-8,The Casting Director>导演觉得你很适合这个角色
<7-8,The Casting Director>The director thinks you're really right for the part

144
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:56,110
<7-8,The Casting Director>明天想见你
<7-8,The Casting Director>and wants to meet you tomorrow.

145
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:58,170
<7-9,Joey>当然  太好了
<7-9,Joey>Wow! Sure! That's great.

146
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:00,570
<7-10,The Casting Director>你经纪人说你对裸戏没问题
<7-10,The Casting Director>Your agent said you're okay with nudity.

147
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:03,840
<7-11,Joey>是  只要表现得有格调一些
<7-11,Joey>Yeah, sure. As long as it's handled tastefully.

148
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,150
<7-11,Joey>谷仓不要太冷就行
<7-11,Joey>And that barn is not too cold.

149
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,900
<7-12,The Casting Director>好极了  还有一件事
<7-12,The Casting Director>Perfect. There's one more thing.

150
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:14,980
<7-12,The Casting Director>导演希望电影里
<7-12,The Casting Director>It's important to the director

151
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:17,980
<7-12,The Casting Director>每一处细节都还原现实
<7-12,The Casting Director>that everything in the movie's authentic.

152
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:20,910
<7-12,The Casting Director>你和莎拉的性爱场面...
<7-12,The Casting Director>So in your love scene with Sarah...

153
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:25,230
<7-12,The Casting Director>她说自己从没见过非犹太的裸体男子
<7-12,The Casting Director>...she talks about how she's never seen a naked man who wasn't Jewish.

154
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:26,730
<7-13,Joey>所以...
<7-13,Joey>So...

155
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,140
<7-13,Joey>所以...怎么样
<7-13,Joey>So... what?

156
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:35,940
<7-14,The Casting Director>导演坚持出演这个角色的人...
<7-14,The Casting Director>So, the director is insisting that whoever play that part...

157
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:39,960
<7-14,The Casting Director>是正宗的  在人体结构上...
<7-14,The Casting Director>...be authentically, anatomically...

158
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:43,210
<7-14,The Casting Director>不是犹太人  你知道我的意思吗
<7-14,The Casting Director>...not Jewish. You know what I'm saying?

159
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,490
<7-15,Joey>知道
<7-15,Joey>Yes!

160
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:46,610
<7-17,Joey>不知道  什么意思
<7-17,Joey>No. What?

161
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:53,670
<7-18,The Casting Director>那时意大利天主教移民没有...
<7-18,The Casting Director>An Italian Catholic immigrant at this time would not be...

162
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,240
<7-18,The Casting Director>行过受诚礼
<7-18,The Casting Director>Bar mitzvah-ed?

163
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:02,990
<8-1,Monica>-想拿到这个角色  你不能...  -对
<8-1,Monica>- To get this part, you can't be... - No.

164
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:03,950
<8-3,Monica>-可你是  -对
<8-3,Monica>- But you are? - Yeah.

165
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:06,180
<8-5,Monica>-但你告诉他们你不是  -对
<8-5,Monica>- But you told them you weren't? - That's right.

166
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:10,990
<8-7,Monica>真的完全没有了吗
<8-7,Monica>It's definitely all gone?

167
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:12,950
<8-7,Monica>一点努力的余地都没有吗
<8-7,Monica>There's nothing there to work with?

168
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:18,350
<8-7,Monica>你当时是怎么想的
<8-7,Monica>What were you thinking?

169
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:21,000
<8-8,Joey>我不知道  我超想拿到这个角色
<8-8,Joey>I don't know. I really want this part.

170
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,930
<8-8,Joey>他们说不管试镜时被问到什么问题
<8-8,Joey>They tell you no matter what you're asked during an audition,

171
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,400
<8-8,Joey>都回答是
<8-8,Joey>you say yes.

172
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,990
<8-8,Joey>如果要求你骑马  就说你会
<8-8,Joey>Like if they want you to ride a horse, tell them you can.

173
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:30,680
<8-8,Joey>之后再想办法解决
<8-8,Joey>And you just figure out how to do it later.

174
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:35,120
<8-9,Monica>这和学骑马可不一样
<8-9,Monica>Joey, this is not like learning to ride a horse.

175
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,730
<8-9,Monica>这就像是要学会...
<8-9,Monica>This is like learning...

176
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:38,800
<8-9,Monica>长出一件高领毛衣
<8-9,Monica>...to grow a turtleneck.

177
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:47,440
<8-10,Joey>我知道
<8-10,Joey>I know, I know, okay?

178
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:50,610
<8-10,Joey>明天我去见导演的时候
<8-10,Joey>Apparently, tomorrow, when I go meet the director...

179
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:51,830
<8-10,Joey>我必须脱光衣服
<8-10,Joey>I have to take my clothes off

180
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:54,300
<8-10,Joey>让他们看到我身体的全貌
<8-10,Joey>so they can see what my body looks like.

181
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,370
<8-11,Monica>你要怎么办啊
<8-11,Monica>What are you gonna do?

182
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:00,940
<8-12,Joey>我得打给经纪人告诉她我不能接这个角色了
<8-12,Joey>I have to call my agent and tell her I can't do the part.

183
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:03,900
<8-13,Monica>除非...
<8-13,Monica>Unless...

184
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:06,880
<8-14,Joey>除非什么
<8-14,Joey>Unless what?

185
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:11,440
<8-15,Monica>虽说听着疯狂  但我们可能可以做点...
<8-15,Monica>This may sound crazy, but there may be something we could...

186
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,660
<8-15,Monica>造型
<8-15,Monica>...fashion.

187
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,870
<8-17,Monica>-比如呢  -我还没思路
<8-17,Monica>- Like what? - Well, I'm not sure yet, but...

188
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,300
<8-17,Monica>不过我的第一反应是
<8-17,Monica>Off the top of my head, I'm thinking...

189
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,640
<8-17,Monica>双面胶带加某种午餐肉
<8-17,Monica>...double-sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat.

190
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:37,140
<9-1,Phoebe>我有个关于派对主题的好主意
<9-1,Phoebe>I've got a great idea for party favors for the shower.

191
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:41,590
<9-1,Phoebe>找一些红木盒子  刻上每个人的名字
<9-1,Phoebe>Okay, we get mahogany boxes and carve everyone's names in them.

192
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:44,890
<9-1,Phoebe>在里面放上每个人的出生石
<9-1,Phoebe>Then inside is each persors individual birthstone.

193
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,920
<9-3,Phoebe>好  好
<9-3,Phoebe>Okay. Okay.

194
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:53,310
<9-2,Rachel>你来搞定
<9-2,Rachel>You take care of that.

195
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:59,260
<9-2,Rachel>派对就在明天  我们还没有宾客名单
<9-2,Rachel>And meanwhile, the party's tomorrow and we don't have a guest list.

196
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:02,250
<9-3,Phoebe>好吧  我们知道要来的有谁
<9-3,Phoebe>Okay. Who do we know that's coming?

197
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,300
<9-3,Phoebe>有我  你要来吗
<9-3,Phoebe>Me. Are you?

198
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:08,930
<9-6,Rachel>怎么样啊  莫妮卡
<9-6,Rachel>Hey, what's up, Mon?

199
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:12,610
<9-7,Monica>我在替乔伊做东西  可以搜一下你的冰箱吗
<9-7,Monica>I'm making something for Joey. Do you mind I raid your fridge?

200
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,290
<9-8,Rachel>请便
<9-8,Rachel>Have at it.

201
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:19,670
<9-9,Monica>好  火鸡肉  没有用
<9-9,Monica>All right. Turkey? That won't work.

202
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,130
<9-9,Monica>奶酪  没有用
<9-9,Monica>Cheese? That won't work.

203
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:25,970
<9-9,Monica>橄榄面包  希望没用
<9-9,Monica>Olive loaf? I hope that won't work.

204
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:30,370
<9-10,Rachel>你在替他做三明治吗
<9-10,Rachel>Are you making him a sandwich?

205
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:33,370
<9-11,Monica>不  比较像是鸡肉卷
<9-11,Monica>No, it's more like a wrap.

206
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,450
<9-11,Monica>好  我要走了
<9-11,Monica>Okay, so I'm gonna go, guys.

207
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:42,720
<9-13,Monica>你们可以继续讨论要送我什么礼物
<9-13,Monica>So you can get back to deciding on what to get me for a present!

208
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:48,390
<9-14,Rachel>我们还要送她礼物
<9-14,Rachel>We have to get her a present?

209

<9-15,Phoebe>好吧  看我拿到了什么
<9-15,Phoebe>Okay, but look. Look at what I got.

210
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,400
<9-15,Phoebe>她的通讯录  我们的宾客名单
<9-15,Phoebe>It's her address book. We have a guest list.

211
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:00,990
<9-16,Rachel>你好厉害  你从她皮包拿的吗
<9-16,Rachel>Oh, my god. You're amazing. Did you pull that out of her purse?

212
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:04,590
<9-17,Phoebe>还有办派对的启动资金
<9-17,Phoebe>Uh-huh. And a little seed money for the party.

213
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:14,760
<10-1,Ross>凯西
<10-1,Ross>Cassie?

214
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:17,250
<10-2,Cassie>罗斯
<10-2,Cassie>Hey, Ross!

215
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,470
<10-4,Cassie>好久不见
<10-4,Cassie>It's been so long!

216
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,290
<10-4,Cassie>上一次我见到你时
<10-4,Cassie>Last time I saw you...

217
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:27,340
<10-4,Cassie>你还搭着帐篷排队买《绝地归来》的电影票
<10-4,Cassie>...you were setting up your tent in line for Return of the Jedi.

218
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,030
<10-4,Cassie>对
<10-4,Cassie>That's right.

219
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:33,300
<10-5,Ross>所以那天你有看到我了  却装作没看到
<10-5,Ross>So you did see me that day. Because it seemed like you didn't.

220
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,510
<10-6,Cassie>-对不起  -没关系  请进
<10-6,Cassie>- Yeah, sorry about that. - It's okay. Come on in.

221
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,540
<10-8,Cassie>谢谢你让我住在这儿  莫妮卡家不错
<10-8,Cassie>Thanks for letting me stay here. Monica's place was nice.

222
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:46,330
<10-8,Cassie>但她未婚夫一直瞪着我看
<10-8,Cassie>But her fiance sure stares a lot.

223
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:11,830
<10-10,Cassie>天啊  你学钱德勒学得真像
<10-10,Cassie>Oh, my God! You do a great Chandler!

224
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:18,510
<10-11,Ross>我有模仿才能
<10-11,Ross>I have a knack for impressions.

225
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:21,610
<10-12,Cassie>等我们再熟一点  你也可以学[干]我
<10-12,Cassie>Maybe after we get re-acquainted you could do me.

226
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,100
<10-13,Ross>好  不要
<10-13,Ross>Yeah. No!

227
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:35,550
<11-1,Ross>凯西  你的...
<11-1,Ross>Cassie, how you doing on that...

228
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:37,670
<11-1,Ross>热狗吃得怎样了
<11-1,Ross>...hot dog?

229
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,010
<11-2,Cassie>-我吃完了  -感谢上帝
<11-2,Cassie>- I'm all done. - Thank God.

230
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,870
<11-4,Cassie>我们上次一起出去玩
<11-4,Cassie>I guess the last time we hung out was

231
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,390
<11-4,Cassie>是那次我们父母一起租了那座沙滩别墅
<11-4,Cassie>when our parents rented that beach house together.

232
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:53,760
<11-5,Ross>记得我当时骑在你身上
<11-5,Ross>Remember the time I pinned you down

233
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,310
<11-5,Ross>把你胳肢哭了
<11-5,Ross>and tickled you until you cried?

234
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,950
<11-5,Ross>我们现在大了  不能那么闹了
<11-5,Ross>We're probably too old to do that now.

235
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,860
<11-6,Cassie>我一直都记得那个夏天
<11-6,Cassie>I'll always remember that summer.

236
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:07,660
<11-6,Cassie>我就是那时长了这些雀斑
<11-6,Cassie>Because it's when I got all these freckles.

237
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,700
<11-6,Cassie>我一直都记得那个夏天...
<11-6,Cassie>I'll always remember that summer...

238
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:17,020
<11-7,Ross>因为那时我才意识到我们是亲戚
<11-7,Ross>...because that's when I realized that we are related.

239
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,190
<11-8,Cassie>你花了那么久才发现
<11-8,Cassie>It took you that long to figure it out?

240
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:22,440
<11-9,Ross>我是有点反应迟钝
<11-9,Ross>I'm a little slow.

241
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,360
<11-9,Ross>我们的孩子也会这样
