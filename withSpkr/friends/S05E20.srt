00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:19,550
<5-9,Chandler>这是什么道理
<5-9,Chandler>How do you figure that?

136
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,990
<5-10,Ross>醒醒吧  我坐在前座
<5-10,Ross>Hello! I'm in the front seat, okay?

137
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:25,150
<5-10,Ross>我是盖瑞的搭档
<5-10,Ross>I'm Gary's partner!

138
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:28,730
<5-11,Chandler>你说搭档的时候不像警察
<5-11,Chandler>Y'know, when you say partner it doesn't sound cop.

139
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:30,740
<5-11,Chandler>倒像是同志
<5-11,Chandler>It sounds gay.

140
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,310
<5-12,Ross>你眼红
<5-12,Ross>Umm, jealous!

141
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:36,960
<5-13,Gary>麻烦别张扬  我们这是秘密出勤
<5-13,Gary>Hey, do you mind? We're under cover here.

142
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:38,280
<5-14,Ross>好  没问题
<5-14,Ross>Yeah, no problem.

143
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,640
<5-15,Gary>罗斯
<5-15,Gary>Ross!

144
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:43,580
<5-16,Ross>抱歉  好了
<5-16,Ross>Sorry! Sorry! Oh, there!

145
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:50,550
<5-16,Ross>盖瑞  猜我是谁  打电话回家
<5-16,Ross>Hey Gary, who am I? Phone home!

146
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:57,700
<5-17,Chandler>罗斯警官被打入后座  和访客一起了
<5-17,Chandler>Look at Officer Ross riding back here with the visitors.

147
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:00,830
<5-18,Joey>是啊  怎么一回事呢  塞尔皮科警官
<5-18,Joey>Yeah, what's up with that Serpico?

149
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,650
<5-18,Joey>你有想我吗
<5-18,Joey>Are you thinking about me?

150
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,870
<6-1,Emily>一定没有  如果有的话
<6-1,Emily>Of course you're not, but if you are,

151
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:11,670
<6-1,Emily>今晚打给我  好吧  再见
<6-1,Emily>call me tonight. Okay, bye.

152
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,960
<6-2,Monica>不妙
<6-2,Monica>Nooo!

153
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,830
<6-3,Rachel>我知道
<6-3,Rachel>I know!

154
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:22,750
<6-4,Monica>幸好你在这里  我们得把这段留言删掉
<6-4,Monica>Well thank God you were here! I mean, we have to erase that!

155
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,980
<6-5,Rachel>什么  我们不能那样
<6-5,Rachel>What?! We can't do that!

156
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:27,510
<6-6,Monica>非这样不可  万一罗斯听到了
<6-6,Monica>We have too! I mean what if Ross's hears that

157
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,670
<6-6,Monica>回电给她  他们又复合了怎么办
<6-6,Monica>and then calls her back and then they get back together?

158
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,030
<6-6,Monica>你希望那样吗
<6-6,Monica>Is that what you want?

159
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,960
<6-6,Monica>罗斯跟那个控制欲超强
<6-6,Monica>Ross back with that controlling,

160
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,910
<6-6,Monica>神经质的疯子艾蜜莉复合
<6-6,Monica>neurotic, crazy Emily?

161
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,910
<6-6,Monica>那个不让罗斯见你的艾蜜莉
<6-6,Monica>The Emily that wouldn't let him see you?

162
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,720
<6-7,Rachel>不行  万万不可
<6-7,Rachel>Noo! Oh no! No! God no!

163
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:41,500
<6-7,Rachel>罗斯绝对不能和她复合
<6-7,Rachel>He should not get back together with her.

164
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:45,250
<6-7,Rachel>你知我知  就连罗斯都知道
<6-7,Rachel>I know that! You know that! Even Ross knows that!

165
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,210
<6-7,Rachel>但我们还是没权力擅自删掉罗斯的留言
<6-7,Rachel>But that still doesn't give us the right to erase his message!

166
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,370
<6-8,Monica>我是他的妹妹  我爱他
<6-8,Monica>I'm his sister, okay? I love him!

167
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:52,850
<6-8,Monica>不想看他受到伤害
<6-8,Monica>I don't want to see him get hurt!

168
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,140
<6-8,Monica>拜托  我这样还没有权控制...
<6-8,Monica>Come on! Doesn't that give me the right to control him-

169
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,060
<6-8,Monica>帮助他吗
<6-8,Monica>help him?

170
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:02,260
<6-9,Rachel>我觉得需要帮助的不是他
<6-9,Rachel>I don't think he's the one who needs help.

171
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,890
<6-10,Monica>艾蜜莉情绪不稳定
<6-10,Monica>No, look, she's obviously unstable, okay?

172
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,420
<6-10,Monica>她竟然想在结婚当天落跑
<6-10,Monica>I mean she's thinking about running out on her wedding day.

173
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:16,260
<6-10,Monica>好啦  但你看看她让罗斯陷入了什么处境
<6-10,Monica>Okay, fine! But I mean, look at the position she's putting him in!

174
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:17,940
<6-10,Monica>你要罗斯怎么办
<6-10,Monica>What's he gonna do?

175
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,340
<6-10,Monica>难不成在艾蜜莉结婚当天
<6-10,Monica>Ross is gonna run over there on the wedding day

176
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:23,720
<6-10,Monica>跑去破坏婚礼  谁做得出那种事
<6-10,Monica>and break up the marriage?! I mean, who would do that?!

177
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:31,200
<6-10,Monica>好啦  不过这是两码子事
<6-10,Monica>Okay, fine, all right, but that's y'know, it's different!

178
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:34,990
<6-10,Monica>虽然两件事的主角都是一样的
<6-10,Monica>Although it did involve a lot of the same people.

179
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,020
<6-12,Monica>艾蜜莉显然想用变态的笑话
<6-12,Monica>Y'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke

180
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:39,120
<6-12,Monica>来恶整罗斯
<6-12,Monica>she's trying to play on him.

181
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:40,290
<6-13,Rachel>够了  你疯了
<6-13,Rachel>Okay, you are crazy!

182
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:43,730
<6-13,Rachel>她听起来真的很沮丧  你听听
<6-13,Rachel>I'm sorry, but she sounded generally upset! I mean, listen!

183
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:46,120
<6-14,Answering Machine>您的留言已经删除
<6-14,Answering Machine>Your messages have been erased.

184
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:49,300

<6-15,Rachel>Noooooooo!

185
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:53,640
<7-1,Chandler>我们很安全  对吧
<7-1,Chandler>Okay, y'know, we-we're safe right?

186
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:55,370
<7-1,Chandler>不可能会有厄运降临
<7-1,Chandler>I mean nothing bad can go down!

187
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,510
<7-2,Gary>对  不过我倒想起来了  签一下这个
<7-2,Gary>No. But that reminds me,  sign this.

188
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,750

<7-3,Ross>What is it?

189
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,930
<7-4,Gary>没什么  只是断腿或脑袋开花
<7-4,Gary>Oh it's nothing, it just says that you can't sue the city

190
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,960
<7-4,Gary>也不能告到市政府头上
<7-4,Gary>if you scrap your knee or y'know, get your head blown off.

191
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:08,280
<7-5,Chandler>快点哦  我要签
<7-5,Chandler>Oh, hurry up. I want to sign that.

192
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,390
<7-6,Gary>好了  他来了
<7-6,Gary>Okay, here he comes.

193
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:14,970
<7-6,Gary>他在干嘛  搞什么鬼
<7-6,Gary>What is he doing? What the hell is he doing?!

194
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,260
<7-7,Ross>什么  怎么了

197
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,810
<7-10,Gary>他看到我们了  别动  不要看他
<7-10,Gary>Okay, he sees us. Now don't move. Don't look at him.

198
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:39,210
<7-11,Gary>没事的  只是车子逆火
<7-11,Gary>Hey, it's okay. It was just a car backfire.

199
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:43,720
<7-11,Gary>瞧啊  你想用身体掩护朋友
<7-11,Gary>Hey, look at that! You tried to save your buddy.

200
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:47,380
<7-11,Gary>看到没有  看到他的表现了吗
<7-11,Gary>You see that? You see what he did?

206
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:11,420
<8-2,Rachel>等等
<8-2,Rachel>No, wait. Wait.

207

<8-4,Rachel>不是啦  莫妮卡  我们得补救这个
<8-4,Rachel>No, Monica! Monica! We have to fix this!

209
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,000
<8-5,Monica>我们无能为力啊  你已经把留言删掉了
<8-5,Monica>There's nothing we can do. You erased the message!

210
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,430
<8-6,Rachel>我可以老实跟他说啊
<8-6,Rachel>I could tell him about it.

211
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,700
<8-7,Monica>如果你想要这么明理的话
<8-7,Monica>Well, if you're gonna be totally rational about this,

212
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,350
<8-7,Monica>我也争不过你
<8-7,Monica>I can't argue with you! All right?

213
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,330
<8-7,Monica>好啦  你想告诉他就说吧
<8-7,Monica>Fine, if you wanna tell him, tell him.

214
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,060
<8-7,Monica>我不想介入
<8-7,Monica>I just don't want to be a part of it.

215
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,620
<8-8,Rachel>或许又是艾蜜莉打来  说同样的话
<8-8,Rachel>Oh, maybe that's Emily calling back to leave the exact same message.

216
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,090
<8-8,Rachel>罗斯  是你啊
<8-8,Rachel>Hey Ross! It's you!

217
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,740
<8-9,Ross>我只是要你记住这种感觉
<8-9,Ross>I just want you to remember this feeling.

218
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:44,460
<8-9,Ross>活着是一种幸运

<9-1,Gary>有人想见见英雄吗
<9-1,Gary>Hey, anybody want to meet a hero?

225

<9-4,Ross>我们在警车里
<9-4,Ross>Okay, so, we're in the car...

229
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:12,230
<9-5,Gary>慢着

00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:20,750
<9-4,Ross>我们在警车里
<9-4,Ross>Okay, okay, so we're in the car. Right?

233
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,340
<9-8,Ross>突然砰一声  有人开枪
<9-8,Ross>And bang! A shot was fired.

234
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:27,010
<9-8,Ross>乔伊完全不顾自己的安危
<9-8,Ross>And Joey with no regard for his own safety

235
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:29,240
<9-8,Ross>扑到我身上保护我
<9-8,Ross>throws himself on me!

236
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,690
<9-9,Phoebe>天啊  乔伊
<9-9,Phoebe>My God, Joey!

237
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,590
<9-10,Chandler>那是汽车逆火放屁的声音
<9-10,Chandler>It was a car backfire!

238
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,200
<9-11,Ross>对  但是当时他并不知道
<9-11,Ross>Yeah, but-but he didn't know that!

239
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,390
<9-12,Joey>对  我不知道
<9-12,Joey>Yeah, I didn't know that.

240
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:41,460
<9-13,Ross>那很有可能会是子弹的
<9-13,Ross>And it could've just as easily have been a bullet.

241
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,720
<9-14,Gary>乔伊  你有没有想过要当警察
<9-14,Gary>Hey Joe, you ever think about joining the force?

242
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:44,870
<9-14,Gary>警界很需要你这种人
<9-14,Gary>We could use a guy like you.

243
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,420
<9-15,Chandler>听到巨响就吓得跳起来
<9-15,Chandler>Who jumps at loud noises!

244
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:52,370
<9-16,Ross>哇  我今晚有可能丧命的
<9-16,Ross>Wow! I could've died tonight.

245
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,760
<9-17,Chandler>对  如果那部放屁的车把你碾过去的话
<9-17,Chandler>Yeah! If the car that backfired had run over you!

246
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:58,880
<9-17,Chandler>我先回家去了  省得罗斯
<9-17,Chandler>Y'know what, I'm gonna go home before Ross starts rambling

247
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:00,860
<9-18,Ross>大谈人生新发现
<9-18,Ross>about his newfound respect for life.

248
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,670
<9-18,Ross>我的人生的确有了新发现
<9-18,Ross>I do have a newfound respect for life.

249
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:07,110
<9-19,Chandler>我的天
<9-19,Chandler>Oh my God!

250
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,950
<9-20,Gary>亲爱的  你要吃晚餐吗

<9-21,Phoebe>你知道吗
<9-21,Phoebe>Oh, y'know what?

253
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:19,070
<9-21,Phoebe>如果现在听到枪声  我一定会扑到你身上
<9-21,Phoebe>If I heard a shot right now, I'd throw my body on you.

254
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:19,750
<9-21,Phoebe>是吗
<9-21,Phoebe>Oh yeah?

255
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,020
<9-22,Gary>那我们或许应该去治安不好的街区散步
<9-22,Gary>Well maybe you and I should take a walk through a bad neighborhood.

256
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,000
<9-24,Gary>-好的  -好
<9-24,Gary>- Okay! - All right.

257
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:25,280
<9-25,Phoebe>再见
<9-25,Phoebe>Bye!

258
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:26,300
<9-25,Phoebe>再见
<9-25,Phoebe>Bye!

259
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:32,500
<9-27,Joey>罗斯  你别再闹了
<9-27,Joey>Cut it out Ross!

260
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:35,800
<9-27,Joey>我不想在同一天里  救完你又痛扁你一顿
<9-27,Joey>I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day!

261
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:48,850
<10-1,Joey>兄弟  你刚才怎么先闪了
<10-1,Joey>Dude! How come you took off?

262
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,320
<10-2,Chandler>我只是去散步
<10-2,Chandler>Oh, I just went for a walk,

263
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,970
<10-2,Chandler>在客厅里绕来绕去
<10-2,Chandler>around the living room. Whatever...

264
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:55,710
<10-3,Joey>有什么不对吗
<10-3,Joey>Is something wrong?

265
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,860
<10-4,Chandler>没有  我只是累了
<10-4,Chandler>No. No I'm just tired.

266
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:00,210
<10-4,Chandler>走路走累了
<10-4,Chandler>Y'know, from-from the walk.

267
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,110
<10-5,Joey>好吧
<10-5,Joey>Okay.

268
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:07,050
<10-6,Chandler>你扑上去救罗斯  罗斯
<10-6,Chandler>You dove in front of Ross! Ross!

269
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:10,290
<10-7,Joey>原来是这么一回事
<10-7,Joey>That's what this is about!

270
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,530
<10-7,Joey>天啊  你恨罗斯
<10-7,Joey>Oh my God, you hate Ross!

271
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,480
<10-8,Chandler>我没有恨罗斯
<10-8,Chandler>I do not hate Ross!

272
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:19,690
<10-9,Joey>你当然有  我救了他
<10-9,Joey>Of course you do! I saved him!

273
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:21,640
<10-9,Joey>你生我的气  这下全都说得通了
<10-9,Joey>You're mad at me! It all adds up!

274
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,560
<10-9,Joey>你想铲除罗斯
<10-9,Joey>You want Ross out of the picture.

275
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,040
<10-10,Chandler>铲除什么
<10-10,Chandler>What picture?

276
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:27,880
<10-11,Joey>不知道  但是你说的话很不中听
<10-11,Joey>I don't know, but I don't like what I'm hearing!

277
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,650
<10-12,Chandler>我很高兴你在汽车放屁事件中  救了罗斯
<10-12,Chandler>Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire,

278
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,380
<10-12,Chandler>但那如果真的是子弹怎么办
<10-12,Chandler>but it could've been a bullet and you y'know,

279
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:34,870
<10-12,Chandler>你竟然救他不救我
<10-12,Chandler>you didn't try to save me!

280
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:37,890
<10-13,Joey>原来你在气这个
<10-13,Joey>Ohh, you're upset

281
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:40,500
<10-13,Joey>你以为我觉得罗斯比你重要
<10-13,Joey>because you think I chose Ross over you!

282
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:45,090
<10-13,Joey>不是这样的  我知道你能照顾自己
<10-13,Joey>No! I...knew...you could take care of yourself.

283
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:49,180
<10-13,Joey>罗斯需要别人照顾  他不像你我见过大场面
<10-13,Joey>Y'know, I mean Ross, he need help. He's not street like us!

284
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:52,430
<10-14,Chandler>归根结底  你宁愿冒死救罗斯
<10-14,Chandler>When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross

285
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,990
<10-14,Chandler>也不来救我  这才是重点
<10-14,Chandler>before you would for me. That's the bottom line.

286
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,900
<10-15,Joey>不完全是这样  听我说
<10-15,Joey>Well, no, not exactly! All right, look, I,

287
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:05,090
<10-15,Joey>我那不是要救罗斯  明白吗
<10-15,Joey>I wasn't trying to save Ross. Okay?

288
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:08,320
<10-15,Joey>我的三明治在罗斯旁边
<10-15,Joey>My sandwich was next to Ross.

289
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:11,950
<10-15,Joey>懂了吗
<10-15,Joey>All right?

290
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:16,390
<10-15,Joey>我是要救我的三明治
<10-15,Joey>I was, I was trying to save my sandwich.

291
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:19,630
<10-16,Chandler>怕它被枪打到
<10-16,Chandler>From a bullet!

292
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,870
<10-17,Joey>我知道这说来没啥道理
<10-17,Joey>I know it doesn't make much sense...

293
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,310
<10-18,Chandler>岂止没啥道理
<10-18,Chandler>Much sense?!

294
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,480
<10-19,Joey>钱德勒  那是本能反应
<10-19,Joey>Look Chandler, it was instinct!

295
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,950
<10-19,Joey>当时就扑过去了
<10-19,Joey>Okay? I just went for it!

296
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,430
<10-20,Chandler>所以你冒死去救三明治
<10-20,Chandler>So you risked your life, for a sandwich!

297
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:33,030
<10-21,Joey>我知道这听起来很夸张  钱德勒
<10-21,Joey>I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler

298
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:36,720
<10-21,Joey>但这可是世界上最棒的三明治
<10-21,Joey>this is  the greatest sandwich in the world!

299
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,690
<10-22,Chandler>所以你并不觉得罗斯比我重要
<10-22,Chandler>So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me.

300
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,420
<10-23,Joey>是啊  我绝对不会那样
<10-23,Joey>No! I would never do that!

301
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:47,430
<10-23,Joey>你就像是我的亲兄弟
<10-23,Joey>You-you're like my brother!

302
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:49,000
<10-24,Chandler>真的
<10-24,Chandler>Really?!

303
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,600
<10-25,Joey>对  事实上
<10-25,Joey>Yeah! In fact,

304
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,870
<10-25,Joey>为了证明你对我来说有多重要
<10-25,Joey>to prove how much you mean to me,

305
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,490
<10-25,Joey>给你
<10-25,Joey>here.

306
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:02,350
<10-26,Chandler>谢了
<10-26,Chandler>Thanks.

307
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,530
<10-27,Joey>小心点  这不是热狗
<10-27,Joey>No, eh, oh-oi, easy, it's not a hot dog!

308
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:12,820
<10-28,Joey>是不是很好吃
<10-28,Joey>How good is that?

309
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:16,590
<10-30,Joey>看吧
<10-30,Joey>See?

310
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,090
<10-32,Joey>慢着  兄弟  你在干嘛
<10-32,Joey>Oh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing?!

311
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,540
<10-33,Chandler>你不是要证明我对你来说很重要吗
<10-33,Chandler>I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.

312
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:25,580
<10-34,Joey>是啊  用一口来证明  有没搞错
<10-34,Joey>Yeah. With a bite!  Gee-e-e-eez!

313
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,820
<11-2,Ross>瑞秋  你在这里干嘛
<11-2,Ross>Rach, what uh, what are you doing here?

314
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:48,950
<11-3,Rachel>知道吗  你动不动就往我们公寓跑
<11-3,Rachel>Hey! Y'know what? You are in our apartment all the time! Okay?

315
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,720
<11-3,Rachel>我这只是小巫见大巫而已
<11-3,Rachel>This is, this is just a drop in the bucket mister!

316
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:58,390
<11-4,Ross>没关系啦  重点是你来了
<11-4,Ross>Y'know, it-it doesn't matter. The important thing is that you're here.

317
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:02,230
<11-4,Ross>你是我朋友  而你来到了这里
<11-4,Ross>You're my friend, and you're here. Oh!

318
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:10,040
<11-5,Rachel>我有一点点害怕  罗斯  你是怎么了
<11-5,Rachel>Okay, just a little scared. What's going on Ross?

319
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:13,380
<11-6,Ross>今晚发生了最不寻常的事
<11-6,Ross>The most amazing thing happened tonight.

320
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:15,480
<11-6,Ross>我还以为自己要去见阎王了
<11-6,Ross>I thought my number was up.

321
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:19,020
<11-6,Ross>我体验了真正的濒死经历
<11-6,Ross>I had an actual near death experience!

322
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:20,540
<11-7,Rachel>什么  怎么回事
<11-7,Rachel>What?! What? What happened?!

323
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:23,300
<11-8,Ross>我们不是跟盖瑞一起开车巡逻吗
<11-8,Ross>Okay, okay, we were on the ride along with Gary, right?

324
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:25,280
<11-10,Ross>有人冲我开枪
<11-10,Ross>And somebody took a shot at me!

325
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:29,750
<11-11,Rachel>真的吗
<11-11,Rachel>Really?!

326
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,590
<11-13,Rachel>不是  是车子逆火  但是
<11-13,Rachel>No, a car backfired, but

327
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:37,150
<11-10,Ross>我当时以为有人冲我开枪
<11-10,Ross>I thought somebody was taking a shot at me.

328
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,060
<11-12,Ross>瑞秋  我是劫后余生啊
<11-12,Ross>And Rach, I...I survived!

329
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:45,640
<11-12,Ross>我的人生拥有了全新视野
<11-12,Ross>And I was filled with this-this great respect for life.

330
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:48,600
<11-12,Ross>我要真切体验每一刻
<11-12,Ross>Y'know? I-I want to experience every moment.

331
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:51,950
<11-12,Ross>我要把握每一个机会
<11-12,Ross>I want to seize every opportunity.

332
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,660
<11-12,Ross>现在一切都变得好清晰
<11-12,Ross>I-I am seeing everything so-so clearly now.

333
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:57,420
<11-13,Rachel>就因为汽车逆火吗
<11-13,Rachel>Because a car backfired?

334
00:17:58,550 --> 00:17:59,950
<11-14,Ross>好吧  你来这里干嘛
<11-14,Ross>Okay, why are you here?

335
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:06,060
<11-15,Rachel>我不知道这算不算你所谓的"把握今朝"
<11-15,Rachel>Well, I-I-I don't know how this fits into your whole "seizing" thing

336
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:08,690
<11-15,Rachel>不过艾蜜莉今天打了电话给你
<11-15,Rachel>but um, Emily called you today.

337
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:10,750
<11-16,Ross>你跟她说了话
<11-16,Ross>You talked to her?

338
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,170
<11-17,Rachel>没有  她留言了
<11-17,Rachel>No, she left a message.

339
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:14,540
<11-17,Rachel>不过留言被删掉了
<11-17,Rachel>But it-it kinda got erased.

340
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:17,650
<11-17,Rachel>你的答录机有问题
<11-17,Rachel>There's just something wrong with your machine.

341
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,660
<11-18,Ross>那她说了什么
<11-18,Ross>Well, okay, what-what did she say?

342
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:24,330
<11-19,Rachel>说什么对结婚的事有点迟疑
<11-19,Rachel>Well, uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding

343
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:26,610
<11-19,Rachel>说你们分手是个错误
<11-19,Rachel>and did you guys make a mistake breaking up

344
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:29,280
<11-19,Rachel>她要你回电
<11-19,Rachel>and uh, she wants you to call her.

345
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:31,760
<11-20,Ross>哇
<11-20,Ross>Wow!

346
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:35,330
<11-21,Rachel>我跟你说这件事很对吧
<11-21,Rachel>Now, that-that was a good thing that I told you, right?

347
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:38,230
<11-22,Ross>是啊  当然是这样
<11-22,Ross>Huh? Yeah! Yes, of course!

348
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,630
<11-23,Rachel>谢谢你  因为...  抱歉没事了
<11-23,Rachel>Okay. Thank you! Thank you! Because-I'm sorry, all right.

349
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,890
<11-23,Rachel>我要去跟莫妮卡说  我这样做是对的
<11-23,Rachel>I'm gonna go tell Monica that I was right.

350
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:46,880
<11-23,Rachel>你知道吗  她不希望我...  算了
<11-23,Rachel>Because y'know what? She didn't want me-not important.

351
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:50,170
<11-23,Rachel>重点是我是对的  你自己决定
<11-23,Rachel>The point is, I was right. Your decision.

352
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:55,340
<11-23,Rachel>我是对的  你自己决定
<11-23,Rachel>Okay? I was right. Your decision.

353
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:59,520
<11-24,Ross>对  我想我应该回电给艾蜜莉
<11-24,Ross>Right. I guess, I guess I should call Emily.

354
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:01,280
<11-25,Rachel>不对  你的决定不对
<11-25,Rachel>Okay, no, that's not the right decision.

355
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:05,300
<11-25,Rachel>不对  罗斯  你清醒一点
<11-25,Rachel>That's not, that's not right, no Ross-Ross, come on!

356
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:09,540
<11-25,Rachel>我的意思是  那个女人把你给整惨了
<11-25,Rachel>I mean, that woman made you miserable!

357
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:13,830
<11-25,Rachel>罗斯  你真的还想自找麻烦吗
<11-25,Rachel>Okay, Ross, do you really want to get back into that?

358
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:17,880
<11-26,Ross>如果她是在昨天打来的
<11-26,Ross>Okay, look, yesterday I would've even

359
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,580
<11-26,Ross>我压根不会想回电
<11-26,Ross>considered  calling her back,

360
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:23,240
<11-26,Ross>我体验濒死经历的当天
<11-26,Ross>but my ex-wife calls on the same day

361
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:26,250
<11-27,Rachel>我的前妻正好打电话来
<11-27,Rachel>I have a near death experience.

362
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,390
<11-26,Ross>这一定有所含义
<11-26,Ross>I mean, that-that has got to mean something!

363
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,490
<11-27,Rachel>罗斯  那不是濒死经历
<11-27,Rachel>Ugh, Ross! That was not a near death experience!

364
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,720
<11-27,Rachel>就连经历都谈不上
<11-27,Rachel>That was barely an experience!

365
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,120
<11-28,Ross>当时你并不在场
<11-28,Ross>You weren't there!

366
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,280
<11-28,Ross>或许这就是我应该把握的事
<11-28,Ross>Okay, maybe this is something that I-I'm supposed to seize! Y'know?

367
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:43,820
<11-29,Rachel>好吧  你知道吗
<11-29,Rachel>Okay, y'know what?

368
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,560
<11-29,Rachel>或许这无关把握或是不把握
<11-29,Rachel>Maybe, this is not about seizing stuff.

369
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:52,210
<11-29,Rachel>或许这是关于逃避
<11-29,Rachel>Maybe this is about escaping stuff.

370
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:54,480
<11-31,Rachel>就拿今天来说
<11-31,Rachel>I mean, look-look today

371
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:57,540
<11-31,Rachel>你逃过了  死亡
<11-31,Rachel>you escaped death,

372
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,460
<11-31,Rachel>或许这正是给你逃避的机会
<11-31,Rachel>y'know? And maybe this is a chance for you to escape

373
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:05,540
<11-31,Rachel>不去和艾蜜莉复合
<11-31,Rachel>getting back together with Emily?

374
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,680
<11-32,Ross>这还蛮有道理的
<11-32,Ross>That does make sense.

375
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:14,010
<11-32,Ross>因为我要把握住这个机会
<11-32,Ross>Because I do wanna seize some opportunity,

376
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:17,850
<11-32,Ross>不和她见面或联络
<11-32,Ross>but I-I really don't wanna see or talk to her.

377
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:21,280
<11-33,Rachel>这不就结了
<11-33,Rachel>Well, there you go!

378
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:24,140
<11-34,Ross>或许今天就是
<11-34,Ross>Yeah. Maybe today is just,

379
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,430
<11-35,Rachel>"千钧一发"日(字面意是差点打电话)
<11-35,Rachel>close call day.

380
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,550
<11-36,Ross>瑞秋  谢了
<11-36,Ross>Hey, thanks Rach.

381
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,550
<11-37,Rachel>亲爱的  甭客气
<11-37,Rachel>Ohh, honey no problem.

382
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,700
<11-38,Ross>等等  留言灯在闪
<11-38,Ross>Okay. Oh wait-wait-wait! The message is blinking.

383
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,670
<11-38,Ross>或许留言没被删掉
<11-38,Ross>Maybe you didn't erase it.

384
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:41,050
<11-40,Ross>罗斯  是你啊
<11-40,Ross>"Hey Ross, it's you!"

385
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:45,900
<11-40,Ross>这是旧的留言  没什么好听的
<11-40,Ross>Oh yeah, no that's-that's an old message, nobody needs to hear that.

386
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:50,610
<11-42,Ross>莫妮卡有来过吗
<11-42,Ross>Hey umm, was-was Monica here?

387
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:51,440
<11-43,Rachel>有啊
<11-43,Rachel>Yeah.

388
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:53,280
<11-44,Ross>叫她把我的钱还来
<11-44,Ross>Yeah, I want my money back.

389
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:57,770
<11-45,Rachel>是要用来买邮票的吧
<11-45,Rachel>Yeah, uh you-you probably need that for stamps, right?

390
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,360
<12-1,Ross>菲比  盖瑞有真的中枪过吗
<12-1,Ross>Hey Pheebs, has Gary ever been shot at for real?

391
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:11,590
<12-2,Phoebe>有  一次  小小的一次
<12-2,Phoebe>Yes. Once. Yeah, a little.

392
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:13,970
<12-2,Phoebe>算是他自己打的
<12-2,Phoebe>He kinda did it to himself.

393
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,790
<12-2,Phoebe>这故事没什么好讲的
<12-2,Phoebe>It's not really a good story.

394
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,980
<12-3,Ross>不知道我置身枪战会怎样
<12-3,Ross>I wonder how I would react under fire, y'know?

395
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:22,780
<12-3,Ross>不是汽车逆火  是枪林弹雨
<12-3,Ross>And not backfire but-but heavy fire,

396
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,450
<12-3,Ross>好比我在战场上之类的
<12-3,Ross>like I was in a war or something.

397
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,580
<12-4,Monica>我去打仗一定很厉害
<12-4,Monica>Man, I would be great in a war!

398
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:30,670
<12-4,Monica>一定会是很棒的军事领袖
<12-4,Monica>I mean, I really, I think I would make a fantastic military leader.

399
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,310
<12-4,Monica>跟你们这些人比起来
<12-4,Monica>I mean I know I would make General

400
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,310
<12-4,Monica>我一定会最先当上将军
<12-4,Monica>before any of you guys.

401
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:38,110
<12-5,Chandler>在你被自己的部下枪杀前还是之后
<12-5,Chandler>Before or after you were shot by your own troops?

402
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,090
<12-6,Ross>我知道乔伊会在哪里
<12-6,Ross>I know where Joey would be.

403
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:42,410
<12-6,Ross>他一定会在散兵坑里保护大家
<12-6,Ross>He would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.

404
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:45,630
<12-7,Chandler>对  如果那个散兵坑是用三明治围起来的话
<12-7,Chandler>Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.

405
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:48,610
<12-8,Joey>没错  英雄三明治
<12-8,Joey>Yeah, hero sandwiches.

406
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,310
<12-9,Phoebe>你们知道我主张和平
<12-9,Phoebe>Well you all know that I'm a pacifist

407
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,670
<12-9,Phoebe>我对战争没什么兴趣
<12-9,Phoebe>so I'm not interested in war in any way.

408
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,160
<12-9,Phoebe>不过
<12-9,Phoebe>But y'know what?

409
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:58,530
<12-9,Phoebe>等到革命来临的那一天
<12-9,Phoebe>When the revolution comes,

410
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:00,220
<12-9,Phoebe>我一定会把你们消灭光
<12-9,Phoebe>I will have to destroy you all.

411
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:01,700
<12-9,Phoebe>乔伊  你除外
<12-9,Phoebe>Not you Joey.
