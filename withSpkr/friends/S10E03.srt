<2-7,Chandler>她去了一个那种喷雾晒肤俱乐部
<2-7,Chandler>She went to one of those spray-on tan places.

<2-12,Ross>我是说  这看起来不错

00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,700
<2-23,Monica>还学了假惺惺的英国口音

<2-23,Monica>她在我留言机上的留言是这样的
<2-23,Monica>On the machine, this is her message:

<2-24,Chandler>你这是要模仿英国口音
<2-24,Chandler>Are you trying to do a British accent?

<2-21,Monica>when she called me?

75
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:03,050
<2-27,Phoebe>"哦  很抱歉打你的手机"

00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:12,330
<2-28,Monica>我知道  她还老是拿她碰到的
<2-28,Monica>I know. And she always brags about

00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,130
<2-28,Monica>名人来吹牛
<2-28,Monica>all the famous people she's met.

90
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,210
<2-34,Monica>我觉得可以试试
<2-34,Monica>Well, I guess we could try that.

91
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:36,340
<2-34,Monica>不过...有点太苛刻了吧
<2-34,Monica>But it seems so harsh.

92
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:37,740
<2-34,Monica>你这么做过吗
<2-34,Monica>Have you ever done that?

00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,460
<3-73,Joey>我是解胸罩的专家
<3-73,Joey>I'm an expert at taking off bras.

<3-73,Joey>我一只手就能解开
<3-73,Joey>I could do it with one hand.

201
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,420
<3-73,Joey>我闭着眼睛也行
<3-73,Joey>I could do it with my eyes closed.

202
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,930
<3-73,Joey>有一次我只看了一眼
<3-73,Joey>Once I just looked at one...

203
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,540
<3-73,Joey>它自己就开了

00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,400
<3-73,Joey>都怪你的胸罩

00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,450
<3-75,Joey>那就怪你
<3-75,Joey>Then I blame you.

207
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,170
<3-75,Joey>对
<3-75,Joey>Yeah. That's right.

208
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:03,630
<3-75,Joey>是你把我的天赋都打走了
<3-75,Joey>You threw me off with all your slapping.

<3-76,Rachel>好吧  真的很抱歉  乔伊
<3-76,Rachel>Okay, look, I'm really sorry about that, Joey.

210
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:11,030
<3-76,Rachel>有没有可能是某些层面上
<3-76,Rachel>But do you think maybe, on some level,

211
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,000
<3-76,Rachel>你不想脱掉我的胸罩
<3-76,Rachel>you don't want to take off my bra?

212
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,420
<3-77,Joey>我这人没有其它层面
<3-77,Joey>No, I don't have another level.

213
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,980
<3-78,Chandler>等等  有点不对劲
<3-78,Chandler>Hold on. There's something different.

<3-79,Ross>我去了你老婆推荐的地方
<3-79,Ross>I went to that tanning place your wife suggested.

<3-80,Chandler>你是去了太阳那
<3-80,Chandler>Was that place the sun?

216
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:49,160
<3-81,Ross>比你看到的要糟
<3-81,Ross>Oh, and it gets worse.

217
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,200
<3-82,Chandler>天呐  你一个人就能做
<3-82,Chandler>Oh, my God, you can do a duet of

<3-82,Chandler>《黑檀木和象牙》二重唱
<3-82,Chandler>"Ebony and Ivory" all by yourself.

220
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,970
<3-83,Monica>你怎么能搞成这样
<3-83,Monica>How could you mess this up?

221
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:01,930
<3-83,Monica>这很容易呀
<3-83,Monica>It's so easy.

222

<3-83,Monica>你进到小隔间里
<3-83,Monica>You go in the booth,

00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,730
<3-83,Monica>数到五  转身
<3-83,Monica>count to five and turn around.

224
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,190
<3-84,Ross>你是怎么数到五的
<3-84,Ross>How do you count to five?

225
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:07,090
<3-85,Monica>一二三...
<3-85,Monica>One, two, three--

226

<3-89,Rachel>夏威夷热带小姐这是咋了
<3-89,Rachel>What is up with Miss Hawaiian Tropic?

230
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,610
<3-90,Chandler>你和乔伊的约会怎么样
<3-90,Chandler>How was your date with Joey?

231
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:24,280
<3-91,Rachel>嗯  还不错...
<3-91,Rachel>Well, it was good,

232
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,340
<3-91,Rachel>至少在我们回家之前
<3-91,Rachel>until we got back to our apartment.

233
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,450
<3-91,Rachel>后来我们瞎搞
<3-91,Rachel>And then we were fooling around

234
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,440
<3-91,Rachel>他把手放在我的腿上...
<3-91,Rachel>and he started to put his hand up my leg...

235
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:32,120
<3-91,Rachel>可我却不停的打开它
<3-91,Rachel>...and I kept slapping it away.

236
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:33,510
<3-92,Chandler>你不喜欢
<3-92,Chandler>You didn't like that?

237
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:36,990
<3-93,Rachel>不光是我
<3-93,Rachel>Well, it wasn't just me, all right?

238
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,490
<3-93,Rachel>他也吓坏了
<3-93,Rachel>He freaked out too.

239
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:40,380
<3-93,Rachel>他甚至解不开我的胸罩
<3-93,Rachel>He couldn't even undo my bra.

240
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:43,080
<3-94,Monica>真的  有一次他只看了我胸罩一眼
<3-94,Monica>Really? One time he just looked at my bra

241
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:43,970
<3-94,Monica>它就自己开了
<3-94,Monica>and it popped open.

242
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:49,580
<3-95,Rachel>我不知道我们怎么了
<3-95,Rachel>I do not know what's wrong with us.

243
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:52,280
<3-95,Rachel>我们以前接过吻  感觉很好啊
<3-95,Rachel>We've kissed before and that's been great.

244
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:54,340
<3-95,Rachel>可是这次  感觉不同
<3-95,Rachel>But this time it was leading somewhere...

245
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:57,880
<3-95,Rachel>我明白那是乔伊在抚摸我
<3-95,Rachel>...and I was very aware of the fact that it was Joey touching me.

246
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:00,010
<3-96,Monica>你们要永远做朋友了
<3-96,Monica>You guys have been friends forever.

<3-96,Monica>记得你第一次吻罗斯吗
<3-96,Monica>The first time you kissed Ross,

248
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:02,860
<3-96,Monica>那次多奇怪
<3-96,Monica>how weird that was.

249
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:04,360
<3-96,Monica>你不停地笑
<3-96,Monica>You couldn't stop laughing.

250
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,010
<3-96,Monica>可你也过了那个坎
<3-96,Monica>You got through that.

251
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:08,750
<3-97,Rachel>对  是这样...
<3-97,Rachel>Okay. That's true. That's true,

343
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:34,470
<4-54,Phoebe>强迫  还嗓门很高
<4-54,Phoebe>and compulsive and shrill.

344
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,620
<4-55,Monica>我现在仍然这样

350
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,710
<4-58,Phoebe>在我隔离的所有人中

00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,950
<4-58,Phoebe>自己找路又爬回来的
<4-58,Phoebe>who ever clawed her way back in.

353
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,930
<4-59,Monica>因为我斗志旺盛
<4-59,Monica>That's because I'm scrappy.

354

<4-60,Phoebe>对  是的
<4-60,Phoebe>Yeah, you are,

<4-60,Phoebe>that you fought your way back in...

357
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:07,710
<4-61,Monica>因为我不知道没有你该怎么办
<4-61,Monica>...because I don't know what I would do without you.

358
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:10,470
<4-61,Monica>我也不知道没有你该怎么办

00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,970
<4-62,Monica>既然你又给了我一次机会
<4-62,Monica>I mean, you gave me another chance.

361
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,180
<4-62,Monica>我们应该也给阿曼达一个机会
<4-62,Monica>We should do the same for Amanda.

<4-76,Rachel>超越朋友关系  感觉奇怪吗

387
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:03,610
<4-76,Rachel>有点
<4-76,Rachel>Kind of.

401
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:48,170
<4-82,Rachel>他们的反应是那样的
<4-82,Rachel>Just because it happened that way for them

402
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:50,250
<4-82,Rachel>不见得我们也要那样
<4-82,Rachel>doesn't mean it has to for us.

<4-83,Joey>我是说  事情困难
<4-83,Joey>I mean, just because something's difficult

405
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,660
<4-83,Joey>并不意味着你要退却
<4-83,Joey>doesn't mean that you quit.

<4-84,Rachel>-绝对啊  -好吧

408
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,370
<4-85,Joey>直到我们成功
<4-85,Joey>until we do it.

409
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,790
<4-86,Rachel>对  如果不行的话  我们就会
<4-86,Rachel>If not, we'll just be

410
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,300
<4-86,Rachel>成为另一对没有性爱的夫妇
<4-86,Rachel>a couple that never has sex.

411
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:05,580
<4-87,Joey>就这么计划了
<4-87,Joey>That's a plan.

417
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,650
<4-93,Joey>我想或许他们
<4-93,Joey>I guess they weren't

418
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:50,200
<4-93,Joey>不像我们的友谊这么深吧
<4-93,Joey>as good friends as we are.
