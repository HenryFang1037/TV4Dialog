00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:33,750
<1-27,Rachel>他想怎么做都可以
<1-27,Rachel>and he can be as involved as he wants.

<1-28,Joey>听起来很不错
<1-28,Joey>Well, that sounds good.

<1-33,Chandler>Hey, what was that all about?

41
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:53,870
<1-34,Monica>看来现在告诉你也没关系了
<1-34,Monica>Well, I guess there's no harm in telling you now.

42
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:56,210
<1-34,Monica>瑞秋怀了罗斯的孩子
<1-34,Monica>Rachel and Ross are going to have a baby.

43
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:57,400
<1-34,Monica>什么

44
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,600
<1-35,Chandler>我完全不知道  你为什么不告诉我
<1-35,Chandler>I didn't even know that...!Why didn't you tell me?

45
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,510
<1-35,Chandler>我为什么会这用这种声音说话
<1-35,Chandler>Why am I talking like this?

46
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:08,420
<1-36,Monica>我觉得你藏不住秘密
<1-36,Monica>I didn't think you could keep it a secret.

47
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,370
<1-36,Monica>什么
<1-36,Monica>What?!

48
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,990
<1-37,Chandler>我的嘴可严了
<1-37,Chandler>I am an excellent secret-keeper.

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,250
<1-37,Chandler>我一直保守着我们所有的秘密
<1-37,Chandler>I have kept all our secrets.

<1-38,Joey>-什么秘密  -不  乔伊
<1-38,Joey>- What secrets? - No, no, Joey.

51
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:20,580
<1-39,Chandler>我不会告诉你  因为我的嘴很严
<1-39,Chandler>I'm not gonna tell you, because I am an excellent secret-keeper.

52
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,460
<1-40,Joey>-待会你会告诉我  -你已经知道了
<1-40,Joey>- You'll tell me later? - You already know.

64
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,790
<2-1,Phoebe>送别人去度蜜月  真的好浪漫
<2-1,Phoebe>It's so romantic to send people off on their honeymoon.

65
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,900
<2-2,Joey>莫妮卡跟钱德勒结婚了
<2-2,Joey>You know, Monica and Chandler are married.

<2-2,Joey>Ross and Rachel are having a baby.

67
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,790
<2-2,Joey>或许你跟我也该找些事来做
<2-2,Joey>Maybe you and I should do something.

68
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:24,250
<2-3,Phoebe>别急  吾爱  等到合适的时机吧
<2-3,Phoebe>All in good time, my love. All in good time.

69
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,760
<2-3,Phoebe>该死  我把吉他放在他们家了
<2-3,Phoebe>Shoot! I left my guitar in their apartment.

00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,220
<2-3,Phoebe>你待会能帮我开门吧
<2-3,Phoebe>Well, you can let me in later, right?

71
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,570
<2-4,Joey>不行  我没有钥匙
<2-4,Joey>No, I don't have a key.

72
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:33,940
<2-5,Phoebe>他们拿走我的钥匙说是要交给你
<2-5,Phoebe>They took mine to give to you.

73
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:36,290
<2-5,Phoebe>什么  他们拿走我的说是要交给你
<2-5,Phoebe>What? They took mine to give to you.

74
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,260
<2-6,Joey>他们为什么要拿走我们的钥匙
<2-6,Joey>Why would they take away our keys?

75
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:40,730
<2-7,Phoebe>或许他们不信任我们
<2-7,Phoebe>Maybe they don't trust us.

76
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:42,340
<2-8,Joey>不对啊  他们上次出城时
<2-8,Joey>That's not it. They let me keep my key

77
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,920
<2-8,Joey>还让我帮他们保管钥匙
<2-8,Joey>the last time they were out of town.

78
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,730
<2-9,Phoebe>那次你打破番茄酱瓶
<2-9,Phoebe>You mean the time you broke the ketchup bottle

79
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:48,280
<2-9,Phoebe>拿莫妮卡给客人准备的毛巾来清理
<2-9,Phoebe>and cleaned it with Monica's guest towels?

<2-10,Joey>-我洗了毛巾  -才没有
<2-10,Joey>- Hey, I washed those. - No, you didn't.

81
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:54,140
<2-12,Joey>对  那听起来不像我的作风
<2-12,Joey>Yeah, that didn't sound like me.

82
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,200
<2-13,Phoebe>我该怎么办  我真的要用吉他
<2-13,Phoebe>What am I gonna do? I really need my guitar.

<2-16,Joey>崔格先生  我是乔伊·崔比安尼
<2-16,Joey>Hey, Mr. Treeger? It's Joey Tribbiani.

<2-16,Joey>听着  我得去莫妮卡跟钱德勒家
<2-16,Joey>Listen, I need to get into Monica and Chandler's apartment.

88
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,350
<2-16,Joey>有紧急事件
<2-16,Joey>It's an emergency!

89
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:17,680
<2-16,Joey>煤气泄漏  带大蒜面包过来
<2-16,Joey>Gas leak. Oh, and bring garlic bread.

<2-18,Phoebe>-瑞秋找到你了吗  -没有  怎么了
<2-18,Phoebe>- Did Rachel find you? - No, why?

91
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:25,970
<2-20,Phoebe>她在找你
<2-20,Phoebe>She was looking for you.

92
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,780
<2-21,Ross>那我待会再见她
<2-21,Ross>Well, I guess I'll catch up with her later.

93
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:31,840
<2-22,Phoebe>她真的得马上跟你谈
<2-22,Phoebe>She really wanted to talk to you now.

94
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,270
<2-23,Joey>对  似乎是有重要的事
<2-23,Joey>Yeah, it seemed pretty important.

95
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,290
<2-24,Ross>不
<2-24,Ross>Oh, no.

96
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,950
<2-25,Phoebe>怎么
<2-25,Phoebe>What?

97
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:43,270
<2-26,Ross>我想我知道她要跟我谈什么了
<2-26,Ross>I think I might know what this is about.

98
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,010
<2-27,Joey>真的吗
<2-27,Joey>Really?

99
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,340
<2-27,Joey>对
<2-27,Joey>Yeah.

100
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,250
<2-28,Ross>我们答应不会告诉任何人  但是...
<2-28,Ross>We promised we weren't gonna tell anybody this, but...

101
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:57,810
<2-28,Ross>大约一个月前瑞秋跟我上床了
<2-28,Ross>About a month ago, Rachel and I slept together.

102
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,580
<2-29,Phoebe>结果呢
<2-29,Phoebe>And?

103
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,740
<2-30,Ross>我以为你们会大吃一惊
<2-30,Ross>Wow, I thought you'd be a little more shocked.

104
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,730
<2-31,Phoebe>抱歉  结果呢
<2-31,Phoebe>Oh, sorry. And?!

105
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:17,490
<2-32,Ross>我们说只做一次...
<2-32,Ross>Well, we said we'd just do it that one time...

106
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:22,290
<2-32,Ross>我想她现在或许想要跟我复合
<2-32,Ross>...but now I think she may wanna start things up again.

107
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:24,920
<2-33,Joey>我想不是那样的
<2-33,Joey>Yeah, I don't think that's what it is.

108
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:27,970
<2-34,Ross>怎么  不然会是什么事
<2-34,Ross>Why? What else could it be?

109
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,610
<2-35,Joey>我觉得不太舒服
<2-35,Joey>Oh, wow, I don't feel well.

110
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,000
<2-36,Ross>我觉得就是那么一回事
<2-36,Ross>I'm telling you, I'm telling you, that's what it is.

111
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,770
<2-36,Ross>难怪在婚礼上  她看我的眼神怪怪的
<2-36,Ross>No wonder she was looking at me all funny during the wedding.

112
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,920
<2-36,Ross>她什么都没有告诉你们吗
<2-36,Ross>She didn't say anything to you?

113
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:46,270
<2-37,Phoebe>-或许你吃错东西了  -有可能
<2-37,Phoebe>- Maybe it's something you ate. - Could be, yeah.

114
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:50,580
<2-38,Joey>-拜托  去跟瑞秋谈一谈  -好吧
<2-38,Joey>- Please, just go and talk to Rachel. - Yeah, I guess I should.

115
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:56,100
<2-39,Ross>你们知道我领悟到什么事吗
<2-39,Ross>Man, you know what I have to realize?

116
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:00,330
<2-39,Ross>或许我是那种让女人一夜难忘的男人
<2-39,Ross>Maybe I'm not the type of guy women can have just one night with.

117
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:06,310
<2-39,Ross>她们对我永远都觉得不满足
<2-39,Ross>You know, they always seem to want a little bit more.

118
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,980
<2-39,Ross>我应该记住那一点
<2-39,Ross>I should remember that.

119
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,260
<3-1,Ticket Agent>下一位
<3-1,Ticket Agent>Next.

120

<3-2,Monica>他们在接吻  我们先过去吧
<3-2,Monica>They're kissing. Let's just go around them.

121
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,340
<3-3,Chandler>别打扰他们  他们深爱彼此
<3-3,Chandler>Honey, leave them alone. They're in love.

122
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:29,500
<3-4,Monica>我也爱你  不过爱得井然有序
<3-4,Monica>I'm in love too. But in an orderly fashion.

123
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:31,120
<3-1,Ticket Agent>下一位
<3-1,Ticket Agent>Next.

124
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,430
<3-6,Monica>你们能边走边接吻吗
<3-6,Monica>Hi. Can you do that and walk?

125
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:34,990
<3-6,Monica>她说"下一位"了
<3-6,Monica>Because she said, "Next."

126
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:38,490
<3-7,Woman>抱歉  我们没有听到
<3-7,Woman>Sorry, we didn't hear you.

<8-13,Ross>天啊  门是怎么了
<8-13,Ross>Oh, my God! What happened to the door?

244
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:56,950
<8-14,Joey>看来很明显
<8-14,Joey>So it's noticeable, huh?

245
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,460
<8-15,Ross>瑞秋在这里吗  我得跟她谈一谈
<8-15,Ross>Look, is Rachel here? I need to talk to her.

246
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:01,800
<8-16,Phoebe>你们不是谈过了吗
<8-16,Phoebe>Didn't you two already talk?

247
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,220
<8-16,Phoebe>对  但是
<8-16,Phoebe>Yeah, but...

248
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:07,960
<8-17,Ross>听着  你们知道  瑞秋跟我上过床
<8-17,Ross>Okay. Look, you guys know that Rachel and I slept together...

249
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,580
<8-17,Ross>但除此之外还有别的事
<8-17,Ross>...but there's something else.

250
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:13,570
<8-18,Joey>瑞秋怀孕了
<8-18,Joey>Rachel's pregnant.

251
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:16,170
<8-19,Phoebe>-我的老天爷  -天啊  我不敢相信
<8-19,Phoebe>- Holy mother of God! - Oh, my God, I can't believe that!

252
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,930
<8-21,Phoebe>-她怀了我的孩子  -我是第一次听到这件事
<8-21,Phoebe>- With my child. - That is brand-new information!

253
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:31,330
<8-24,Joey>-你们已经知道了对不对  -知道一点
<8-24,Joey>- You already know, don't you? - Little bit.

254
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,140
<8-25,Ross>-你还好吗  -我会没事的
<8-25,Ross>- How you doing? - Okay. I mean, I'll be okay.

255
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:39,090
<8-25,Ross>我觉得自己处理得不够好
<8-25,Ross>It's just, I don't think I handled it very well.

256
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:41,260
<8-26,Joey>-你跟她说了什么  -什么都没说
<8-26,Joey>- What'd you say to her? - Nothing.

257
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:45,290
<8-27,Ross>但我跟安全套公司的客服部门倒是说了不少
<8-27,Ross>But the complaint department at the condom company got an earful.

258
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:49,640
<8-27,Ross>-我一转身才发现她走了  -罗斯
<8-27,Ross>- Then when I turned around, she was gone. - Oh, Ross.

259
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,000
<8-29,Ross>我知道  但我刚刚才发现
<8-29,Ross>I know. But in my defense,

260
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,150
<8-29,Ross>安全套只有97%的避孕率
<8-29,Ross>I just found out that condoms are only, like, 97% effective.

261
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:58,440
<8-30,Joey>-什么  -我得去找她
<8-30,Joey>- What? - I gotta go find her.

262
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,390
<8-31,Ross>等一下  你是认真的吗
<8-31,Ross>Hey. Hold on! Are you serious?

263
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:04,320
<8-32,Joey>所以安全套有3%的机率不起作用
<8-32,Joey>So, like, 3 percent of the time, they don't even work?

264
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:08,330
<8-32,Joey>他们应该在包装上做标示
<8-32,Joey>They should put that on the box!

265
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,370
<8-33,Ross>-他们的确做了标示  -什么
<8-33,Ross>- Evidently, they do. - What?!

266
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,380
<9-1,Monica>我不敢相信我们到这里了
<9-1,Monica>I can't believe we're here.

267
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:26,330
<9-2,Chandler>-开什么玩笑  -怎么
<9-2,Chandler>- You've gotta be kidding. - What?

268
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,910
<9-4,Front Desk Clerk>为了庆祝你们新婚
<9-4,Front Desk Clerk>As a wedding gift to you,

269
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,820
<9-4,Front Desk Clerk>酒店要帮你们升级到蜜月套房
<9-4,Front Desk Clerk>the hotel would like to give you the honeymoon suite.

270
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,540
<9-5,Monica>不  你们一整天都跟我们过不去
<9-5,Monica>No! You have been screwing us all day!

271
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,840
<9-6,Man>-你们是谁  -我们就是你们
<9-6,Man>- Who are you? - We're you.

272
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,920
<9-7,Chandler>只是迟了十秒钟
<9-7,Chandler>Just 10 seconds later!

273
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,600
<9-8,Monica>你们已经抢走头等舱的位置和休息室
<9-8,Monica>You already got the first-class tickets, you got the lounge.

274
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,370
<9-8,Monica>我们也应该得到免费招待
<9-8,Monica>We should get free stuff too!

275
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,480
<9-8,Monica>不光是你们在度蜜月
<9-8,Monica>You're not the only ones on your honeymoon!

276
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:52,770
<9-9,Woman>我们可以把蜜月套房让给你们
<9-9,Woman>You can have the suite if you want.

277
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:55,040
<9-9,Woman>我们不在乎要睡在哪里
<9-9,Woman>We don't care about where we stay.

278
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:57,760
<9-9,Woman>我们来这里纪念我们对彼此的爱
<9-9,Woman>We're here to celebrate our love for each other.

279
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,530
<9-9,Woman>我们不需要免费招待
<9-9,Woman>We don't have to get free stuff.

280
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:01,230
<9-9,Woman>我们只想在一起
<9-9,Woman>We just want to be together.

281
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:06,640
<9-10,Chandler>我们需要免费招待
<9-10,Chandler>We need the stuff.

282
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:11,190
<10-1,Joey>莫妮卡  我是乔伊
<10-1,Joey>Monica, it's Joey. Listen.

283
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:13,730
<10-1,Joey>菲比跟我闻到你家有煤气味
<10-1,Joey>Phoebe and I smell gas coming from your apartment.

284
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:16,830
<10-2,Monica>什么  真的吗  乔伊闻到有煤气味
<10-2,Monica>What? Are you serious? Joey smells gas.

285
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,280
<10-3,Chandler>还有什么新消息
<10-3,Chandler>What else is new?

286
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:21,480
<10-4,Joey>我们想进去看看  但你拿走了我们的钥匙
<10-4,Joey>We'd check it out, but you took our keys.

287
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,690
<10-5,Monica>快想办法进去
<10-5,Monica>Well, do something. Get in there!

288
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:27,250
<10-6,Joey>要怎么办呢  我可以把你家大门撞开
<10-6,Joey>How? I guess I could break down your door.

289
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,650
<10-7,Monica>对  就那么做
<10-7,Monica>Yeah, do that.

290
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:31,440
<10-8,Joey>-你不会怪我们弄坏东西  -不会
<10-8,Joey>- And you won't blame us for any damage? - No.

291
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,860
<10-9,Monica>你在撞门了吗  我没有听到声音  快呀
<10-9,Monica>Are you doing it? I don't hear anything. Come on.

292
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:38,620
<10-10,Joey>好吧  我来撞门了
<10-10,Joey>Okay, I'll break it down.

293
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,540
<10-11,Phoebe>他正在撞门  他要把门撞开了
<10-11,Phoebe>Hi. He's doing it, he's breaking down the door.

294
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:51,440
<10-11,Phoebe>好了  我们进来了
<10-11,Phoebe>Okay, we're in.

295
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,760
<11-1,Nurse>瑞秋  你感觉舒服吗
<11-1,Nurse>Okay, Rachel, are you comfortable?

296
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:00,330
<11-2,Rachel>如果我说很舒服  你会另眼看我吗
<11-2,Rachel>If I said I was, would you judge me?

297
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,550
<11-3,Nurse>医生马上过来帮你照超声波
<11-3,Nurse>The doctor'll be here in a minute to do your sonogram.

298
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:04,740
<11-3,Nurse>好的
<11-3,Nurse>Okay.

299
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:12,410
<11-4,Rachel>天啊  我发誓  如果他们在家具店卖这个
<11-4,Rachel>Oh, man, I swear, if they sold these at Pottery Barn...

300
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:18,290
<11-7,Ross>我们得谈一谈
<11-7,Ross>We need to talk.

301
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:22,940
<11-8,Rachel>现在吗  我现在的姿势有点不雅
<11-8,Rachel>Right now? Because I kind of got an alfresco situation going on over here.

302
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:25,520
<11-9,Ross>拜托  我真的...
<11-9,Ross>Please, I really...

303
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,360
<11-9,Ross>我想为我刚刚的表现向你道歉
<11-9,Ross>I want to apologize for the way I acted earlier today.

304
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,560
<11-10,Rachel>没关系  麻烦你待在床头边
<11-10,Rachel>Okay, Ross. That's fine. Can you stay up near my head?

305
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,320
<11-11,Ross>什么  抱歉
<11-11,Ross>What? Oh, yeah, sorry.

306
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:36,080
<11-11,Ross>我被冲昏头了  我只想到自己
<11-11,Ross>I think I went a little crazy. I was thinking about myself

307
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:37,710
<11-11,Ross>我应该要为你着想
<11-11,Ross>when I should've been thinking about you...

308
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:40,110
<11-12,Rachel>-没关系  待在床头这边  罗斯  -好
<11-12,Rachel>- Okay, head, Ross! Head, Ross! - Right.

309
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:41,760
<11-12,Rachel>我要你知道
<11-12,Rachel>I want you to know that

310
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,950
<11-13,Ross>我会一直陪在你身边  好吗
<11-13,Ross>I'm gonna be there through this whole thing. Okay?

311
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:48,540
<11-13,Ross>来做产检  上拉梅兹呼吸课
<11-13,Ross>The doctor's appointments, the Lamaze classes,

312
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,450
<11-13,Ross>在公寓里为宝宝安装保护措施
<11-13,Ross>baby-proofing the apartment.

313
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:53,590
<11-13,Ross>但我们可以等到婚后再担心那些事
<11-13,Ross>Although, we can worry about that after we get married.

314
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:56,110
<11-15,Ross>-婚后  -对  我想我们应该结婚
<11-15,Ross>- Married? - Well, yeah, I think we should get married.

315
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:58,850
<11-16,Rachel>你一遇到问题就用结婚来解决吗
<11-16,Rachel>Because that's your answer to everything?

316
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,250
<11-17,Ross>不  那么做是对的
<11-17,Ross>No. Because that's the right thing to do.

317
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,360
<11-18,Rachel>或许吧  只要我们相爱
<11-18,Rachel>Yeah, maybe, if you're in love.

318
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,240
<11-18,Rachel>可是罗斯  我们并不相爱  对吧
<11-18,Rachel>But Ross, we are not in love, are we?

319
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:16,040
<11-19,Ross>对  但是你不可能一个人处理这件事
<11-19,Ross>No. But still, I mean, you can't possibly do this alone.

320
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:17,670
<11-20,Rachel>你说什么
<11-20,Rachel>Excuse me?

321
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:22,570
<11-21,Ross>你甚至没办法一个人在餐厅吃饭
<11-21,Ross>Come on, Rach. You can't even eat alone in a restaurant.

322
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:25,240
<11-22,Rachel>-什么  -如果你没办法一个人吃饭
<11-22,Rachel>- What? - I'm just saying if you can't eat by yourself,

323
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,380
<11-23,Ross>你怎么一个人带孩子
<11-23,Ross>how do you expect to have a baby by yourself?

324
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,960
<11-24,Rachel>我可以一个人吃饭
<11-24,Rachel>I can too eat by myself!

325
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,040
<11-25,Ross>你什么时候一个人吃过
<11-25,Ross>When have you ever?

326
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,380
<11-26,Rachel>当某些同桌的人吃完饭
<11-26,Rachel>When certain people leave the table

327
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,610
<11-26,Rachel>我还没有吃完的时候
<11-26,Rachel>and I am not finished!

328
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,660
<11-27,Ross>有些人光喝一碗汤就得花掉两个小时
<11-27,Ross>Well, certain other people take two hours to eat a bowl of soup!

329
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,040
<11-28,Rachel>拜托  是你狼吞虎咽
<11-28,Rachel>Oh, please. You inale your food.

330
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,360
<11-29,Ross>我跟莫妮卡一起长大
<11-29,Ross>I grew up with Monica.

331
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:45,820
<11-29,Ross>不吃快一点的话就没得吃了
<11-29,Ross>If you didn't eat fast, you didn't eat!

332
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:50,830
<11-30,Dr. Long>我打扰你们了吗
<11-30,Dr. Long>Am I interrupting?

333
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,440
<11-31,Rachel>不  朗格医生  请进
<11-31,Rachel>No, Dr. Long. Please come in.

334
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,780
<11-31,Rachel>他是罗斯  孩子的爸爸
<11-31,Rachel>This is Ross. He is the father.

335
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:58,000
<11-32,Ross>但我不是她的丈夫  因为显然她能单独带大孩子
<11-32,Ross>But not the husband, because, evidently, she can do this alone.

336
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,330
<11-33,Dr. Long>很高兴能见到你  我要开始检查了
<11-33,Dr. Long>Nice to meet you. I'll get started on this.

337
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:06,810
<11-34,Ross>你为什么不能承认你需要我
<11-34,Ross>I don't know why you can't admit you need me?

338
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:09,450
<11-35,Rachel>我的确需要你  我需要你站在床头这边
<11-35,Rachel>I do need you. I need you to stay near my head!

339
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:15,170
<11-36,Dr. Long>好吧  看起来很正常
<11-36,Dr. Long>Okay. Everything looks good.

340
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:17,420
<11-36,Dr. Long>银幕上的画面是这样的
<11-36,Dr. Long>Here it is on the screen.

341
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,190
<11-36,Dr. Long>这是你的子宫...
<11-36,Dr. Long>Here's your uterus...

342
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:24,660
<11-36,Dr. Long>宝宝在这里
<11-36,Dr. Long>...and right here is your baby.

343
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:27,270
<11-37,Ross>天啊
<11-37,Ross>Oh, my God.

344
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,170
<11-38,Rachel>它在那里  我看到了
<11-38,Rachel>There it is. I see it.

345
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:38,090
<11-39,Dr. Long>恭喜  我让你们独处一下
<11-39,Dr. Long>Congratulations. I'll give you two a minute.

346
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:39,940
<11-41,Ross>-好吧  -谢谢
<11-41,Ross>- Okay. - Thank you.

347
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:49,610
<11-42,Ross>很神奇吧
<11-42,Ross>Pretty amazing, huh?

348
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,280
<11-43,Rachel>我看不到
<11-43,Rachel>I don't see it!

349
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,560
<11-44,Ross>-什么  -我看不到
<11-44,Ross>- What? What? - I can't see it.

350
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:07,520
<11-46,Ross>但你说你看到了
<11-46,Ross>But you just said that you did.

351
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,910
<11-47,Rachel>我知道  我说谎了
<11-47,Rachel>I know. I lied.

352
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,920
<11-47,Rachel>我不希望她认为我是个很糟糕的母亲
<11-47,Rachel>I didn't want her to think I was a terrible mother.

353
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:13,320
<11-47,Rachel>我连自己的宝宝都看不到
