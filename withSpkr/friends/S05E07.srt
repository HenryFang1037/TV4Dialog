1
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:07,640
<1-1,Chandler>你在看土著裸女吗

00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:23,240
<1-6,Ross>艾蜜莉的表弟把我赶出来了
<1-6,Ross>Emily's cousin kicked me out!

8
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:27,840
<1-9,Ross>老婆的表弟转租公寓给你
<1-9,Ross>Well, when you're subletting an apartment from your wife's cousin

9
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:29,270
<1-9,Ross>当离婚时
<1-9,Ross>and then you get a divorce,

10
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,980
<1-9,Ross>表弟就会突然把房子要回去
<1-9,Ross>sometimes the cousin suddenly wants his apartment back.

11
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:33,710
<1-10,Chandler>他怎么能这么做  你们没签租约吗
<1-10,Chandler>How can he do that? Didn't you sign a lease?

12
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,820
<1-11,Ross>谁跟亲戚租公寓还签租约
<1-11,Ross>Who needs a lease when it's family!

13
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,560
<1-12,Joey>你可以跟我们住
<1-12,Joey>Hey, you can stay with us! We'll take care of ya!

<1-17,Ross>我最近搬来搬去的
<1-17,Ross>Man, I've been moving around so much lately,

21
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:00,240
<1-17,Ross>简直像盲流
<1-17,Ross>I'm beginning to feel like a nomad.

22
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,710
<1-19,Chandler>-怎么了  -他以为你说你像流氓
<1-19,Chandler>- What? - He thought you said gonad.

38
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,490
<2-1,Health Inspector>莫妮卡  假如餐厅都像你这里这么干挣
<2-1,Health Inspector>Wow, Monica, if every restaurant is as clean as yours,

39
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:02,970
<2-1,Health Inspector>我就失业了
<2-1,Health Inspector>I'd have a tough time making a living.

40
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,680
<2-2,Monica>瞧你说的  莱瑞
<2-2,Monica>Oh, Larry.

41
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:07,900
<2-3,Phoebe>卫生稽查员挣佣金的吗
<2-3,Phoebe>Umm, do health inspectors work on commission?

42
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,260
<2-4,Larry>不  是拿贿赂
<2-4,Larry>No, bribes.

43
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,370
<2-5,Phoebe>-可以笑吧  -当然  我只是开玩笑
<2-5,Phoebe>- It's okay to laugh right? - Yeah, I was just kidding.

44
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,250
<2-8,Larry>我去检查厨房地板
<2-8,Larry>I'll check the kitchen floors.

45
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,090
<2-9,Monica>随便查  莱瑞
<2-9,Monica>Okay, knock yourself out, Larry.

46
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:20,450
<2-10,Phoebe>帅气

47
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:22,930
<2-11,Monica>莱瑞吗
<2-11,Monica>Larry?

00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,580
<2-12,Phoebe>我也愿意让他检查我家厨房地板
<2-12,Phoebe>Oh yeah! I'd let him check out my kitchen floors.

49
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,130
<2-13,Larry>98分
<2-13,Larry>A 98.

50
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,750
<2-13,Larry>你没戴厨师帽  所以扣两分
<2-13,Larry>I deducted 2 points because you are not wearing your chef's hat,

51
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,910
<2-13,Larry>因为违反了第五条规定
<2-13,Larry>and that is a Section 5 violation.

52
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:39,030
<2-14,Monica>听着  莱瑞  亲爱的
<2-14,Monica>Uh, look, Larry honey,

53
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,980
<2-14,Monica>第五条是我写的
<2-14,Monica>umm, I wrote the book on Section 5

54
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,620
<2-14,Monica>我知道在厨房
<2-14,Monica>and I know that you don't have to wear your hat

55
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:44,830
<2-14,Monica>才要戴帽子
<2-14,Monica>unless you're in the kitchen.

56
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,050
<2-15,Larry>你的帽子呢
<2-15,Larry>And where is your hat?

57
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,920
<2-16,Monica>在厨房  我进去拿
<2-16,Monica>It's in the kitchen, I'll go get it.

58
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,590
<2-17,Larry>扣两分
<2-17,Larry>Ahh there's the 2 points.

59
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,150
<2-18,Phoebe>你应该好好读读你写的手册
<2-18,Phoebe>Hey, you should really read that book you wrote.

60
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,810
<2-18,Phoebe>你看到帽子在厨房
<2-18,Phoebe>Wow! You saw the hat in the kitchen

61
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,270
<2-18,Phoebe>知道她进去时没戴帽子
<2-18,Phoebe>and you'd know that she'd have to go in there hatless to get it.

62
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:10,680
<2-18,Phoebe>你可以开一档卫生稽查侦探节目了
<2-18,Phoebe>You can have your own health inspector detective show!

63
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:13,380
<2-19,Larry>你过奖了
<2-19,Larry>Oh, I don't know about that.

64
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,530
<2-20,Phoebe>那样我就能当你的助手  叫芳达
<2-20,Phoebe>Yeah, but then I can be you sidekick Vunda.

65
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,190
<2-21,Larry>也许芳达可以给我电话号码
<2-21,Larry>Maybe uh, Vunda could give me her number

66
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,550
<2-21,Larry>我改天约她吃饭
<2-21,Larry>and I can ask her to dinner sometime.

<3-6,Rachel>他还会颓废好一阵子的
<3-6,Rachel>I mean, he's gonna screwed up for a looong time.

00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,590
<3-13,Danny>庆祝搬新家
<3-13,Danny>it's sort of a house warming kind of thing.

00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,460
<3-14,Monica>太好了
<3-14,Monica>Ohh, fun!

96
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,220
<3-18,Danny>再见
<3-18,Danny>Okay, see ya.

97
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,490
<3-19,Monica>看来他的新家不欢迎我们
<3-19,Monica>Well, I guess we won't be warming his house.

98
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:52,230
<3-20,Rachel>好吧  我知道他在玩什么把戏了
<3-20,Rachel>Okay. All right, I see what he's doing!

99
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:56,610
<3-20,Rachel>他不约我  是想让我约他
<3-20,Rachel>He's not asking me out, because he wants me to ask him out.

100
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:58,080
<3-21,Monica>而你不会主动
<3-21,Monica>And you're not gonna do that.

101
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:02,680
<3-22,Rachel>当然  那样他就占上风了
<3-22,Rachel>That's right! 'Cause that would give him the control!

102
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,960
<3-22,Rachel>所以他借"开派对"
<3-22,Rachel>So now he's all ooh, coming up with this whole

103
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:06,590
<3-22,Rachel>为幌子
<3-22,Rachel>I've got a party thing y'know,

104
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,920
<3-22,Rachel>向我发出邀请的信号
<3-22,Rachel>trying to get me to hint around for an invitation.

105
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,070
<3-22,Rachel>可是我当场给他好看
<3-22,Rachel>Blew up in his face, didn't it?

106
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,320
<3-23,Monica>所以他根本没有要办派对吗
<3-23,Monica>So-so there is no party.

107
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:18,420
<3-24,Rachel>有  当然有
<3-24,Rachel>No, there's a party. There's a party.

108
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:20,460
<3-24,Rachel>但是控制权落谁手中
<3-24,Rachel>But the power,

109
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,700
<3-24,Rachel>依然是未知数
<3-24,Rachel>that is still up for grabs.

110
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:23,980
<3-24,Rachel>懂了吗
<3-24,Rachel>You follow me?

111
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,150
<3-25,Monica>应该吧
<3-25,Monica>I think so.

112
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:30,790
<3-25,Monica>你说他喜欢你  所以故意不约你
<3-25,Monica>So, he-he's not inviting you to his party because he likes you.

113
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:31,870
<3-26,Rachel>就是这样
<3-26,Rachel>Exactly.

114
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,210

174
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:57,590
<7-16,Rachel>等着被他邀请参加派对
<7-16,Rachel>than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party.

175
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:01,510
<7-16,Rachel>但是我说不去  所以还是我占上风

228
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:22,990

00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,800
<10-7,Chandler>第七页也没有吗

<10-10,Ross>Oh, I-I don't know, it's kind of expensive for a studio.

235
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:45,260
<10-11,Joey>可是现在就能搬进去  对不对
<10-11,Joey>But it's available now! Isn't it?

<10-17,Ross>分摊下空气净化器的滤芯的费用
<10-17,Ross>maybe chip in on some new air filters for the purifier?

241
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,740
<10-17,Ross>毕竟净化器大家都有用到
<10-17,Ross>I mean after all, we all are using it.

242
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:04,800
<10-18,Chandler>快点走

246
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:30,400
<11-3,Joey>房东真是太聪明了
<11-3,Joey>Somebody was using his head.

247
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:34,130
<11-3,Joey>再看看其它地方

<11-4,Ross>I think this is it.

249
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,410
<11-4,Ross>算了吧  还是再看看别的公寓
<11-4,Ross>I don't know, maybe we should keep looking.

<12-8,Phoebe>我们走吧
<12-8,Phoebe>Okay, let's go!

274
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:25,170
<12-9,Larry>老兄  卫生条款11-B规定
<12-9,Larry>Hey, buddy!  Are you familiar with Section 11-B of the Health Code

275
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:27,720
<12-9,Larry>垃圾应该从后门拿出去
<12-9,Larry>that requires all refuse material been taking out the back exit?

276
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:30,380
<12-10,Gunther>可是那样就得从干洗店绕路
<12-10,Gunther>But then I'd have to go all the way around the dry cleaner place.

277
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:33,340
<12-11,Larry>你宁可方便也不顾卫生吗
<12-11,Larry>Oh, so you're saying you'd choose convenience over health?!

278
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:36,640
<12-12,Phoebe>莱瑞  别这样
<12-12,Phoebe>Okay, stop! Larry, okay,

279
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:41,690
<12-12,Phoebe>你能不能别老想着工作
<12-12,Phoebe>can't you just be Larry and not Larry the health inspector guy?

280
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:44,040
<12-12,Phoebe>一开始还很刺激
<12-12,Phoebe>Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first

281
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:47,570
<12-12,Phoebe>现在简直是哪家餐厅也去不了
<12-12,Phoebe>but now it's like, okay, so where are we gonna eat ever?

282
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:52,200
<12-13,Larry>那我就口头警告他好了
<12-13,Larry>Well, I suppose I could give him a warning.

283
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,610
<12-13,Larry>谢谢
<12-13,Larry>Thank you.

285
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,790
<12-14,Phoebe>要是吃饱饭后你还想抓人
<12-14,Phoebe>Now, if after dinner you still really need to bust someone,

286
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,090
<12-14,Phoebe>我知道有个热狗摊老板喜欢挖鼻子
<12-14,Phoebe>I know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose.

287
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:13,290
<13-1,Joey>搞不好我们做的是好事
<13-1,Joey>Maybe, maybe we did a good thing,

292
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,400
<13-6,Chandler>现在该怎么办
