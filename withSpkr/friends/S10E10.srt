00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:20,840
<1-4,Phoebe>你会放弃哪一样儿
<1-4,Phoebe>what would you give up,

8
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:21,720

13
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,090
<1-7,Monica>她刚才说的性爱
<1-7,Monica>But when she said "sex,"

14
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,470
<1-7,Monica>我没想到是指和你一起的性爱
<1-7,Monica>I wasn't thinking about sex with you.

15
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,020
<1-8,Chandler>好象我还受了很大恩惠似的
<1-8,Chandler>It's like a giant hug.

16
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:39,880
<1-9,Phoebe>罗斯  你呢
<1-9,Phoebe>Ross, how about you?

00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:44,830
<1-11,Phoebe>那如果是性爱和恐龙呢
<1-11,Phoebe>How about sex or dinosaurs?

20
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:50,980
<1-11,Phoebe>老天啊
<1-11,Phoebe>Oh, my God,

21
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,880
<1-12,Ross>这简直就像《苏菲的选择》
<1-12,Ross>it's like Sophie's Choice.

22
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:54,880
<1-13,Rachel>哦  天啊
<1-13,Rachel>Oh, God.

<1-14,Joey>我不知道  这太难取舍了
<1-14,Joey>I don't know, it's too hard.

26
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:06,140
<1-15,Rachel>不行  你必须得选一个
<1-15,Rachel>No, you gotta pick one.

00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:09,510
<1-16,Joey>食物  不  性爱
<1-16,Joey>Food. No, sex.

28
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:12,100
<1-16,Joey>食物  性爱  食物  性爱…
<1-16,Joey>Food. Sex. Food. Sex--

29
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,340

<2-2,Phoebe>哇  真可爱啊
<2-2,Phoebe>Oh, how cute!

44
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,770
<2-4,Phoebe>她看上去就象个洋娃娃
<2-4,Phoebe>She looks just like a little doll.

45
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,540
<2-5,Rachel>不不  那就是个洋娃娃
<2-5,Rachel>Oh, no, that is a doll.

46
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:07,310
<2-6,Phoebe>噢  感谢上帝
<2-6,Phoebe>Oh, thank God,

47
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,780
<2-6,Phoebe>因为我觉得它看上去有点吓人
<2-6,Phoebe>because that thing's really creepy.

48
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:13,300
<2-6,Phoebe>钱德勒在那儿
<2-6,Phoebe>Look, there's Chandler.

49
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,250
<2-6,Phoebe>噢  那个金发女郎是谁
<2-6,Phoebe>Who's the blond?

50
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,090
<2-7,Rachel>她很漂亮
<2-7,Rachel>She's pretty.

51
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,630
<2-8,Phoebe>他有外遇了
<2-8,Phoebe>He's having an affair.

52
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,380
<2-9,Rachel>他才不是有外遇呢
<2-9,Rachel>He is not having an affair!

53
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,450
<2-10,Phoebe>你知道的啦  我在这事儿上面感觉很准的
<2-10,Phoebe>I'm always right about these things.

54
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:23,920
<2-11,Rachel>不  你才没有呢
<2-11,Rachel>No, you're not.

55
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:26,280
<2-11,Rachel>上周你还在想罗斯想把你宰了
<2-11,Rachel>Last week, you thought Ross was trying to kill you.

56
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:27,540
<2-11,Rachel>对不起
<2-11,Rachel>Well, sorry,

57
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:28,610
<2-12,Phoebe>但确实很让人难以相信
<2-12,Phoebe>but it's hard to believe

58
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,490
<2-12,Phoebe>如果不是真的
<2-12,Phoebe>that anyone would tell a story that dull...

59
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,840
<2-12,Phoebe>谁会讲那么无聊的事
<2-12,Phoebe>...just to tell it.

60
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,210
<2-12,Phoebe>我敢发誓他们俩之间肯定有些什么事
<2-12,Phoebe>There's something going on with them.

61
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,610
<2-12,Phoebe>快看  他们俩上了同一部车
<2-12,Phoebe>Look! He's getting into the car with her.

62
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,240
<2-13,Rachel>那并不能说明什么
<2-13,Rachel>That doesn't mean anything.

63
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:42,100
<2-14,Phoebe>是吗  让我们走着瞧
<2-14,Phoebe>Oh, yeah? Well, let's see.

<4-5,Chandler>香水不是我的
<4-5,Chandler>Well, at least the perfume's not mine.

90
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:03,420
<4-5,Chandler>你就应该谢天谢地了
<4-5,Chandler>Be thankful for that.

<4-12,Monica>南茜还说这个价钱非常优惠
<4-12,Monica>And Nancy said it's really underpriced...

100
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:28,750
<4-12,Monica>因为那家伙丢了工作
<4-12,Monica>...because the guy lost his job

101
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,890
<4-12,Monica>不得不搬去跟父母住  所以急于出手

00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,520
<4-16,Monica>我想我们应该买下来
<4-16,Monica>I think we should.

106
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:41,190
<4-17,Chandler>我也这么想
<4-17,Chandler>I do too.

107

<4-21,Chandler>菲比打电话来了
<4-21,Chandler>into Nancy's car.

113
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:53,110
<4-21,Chandler>如果她问起就说我一天都在工作
<4-21,Chandler>If she asks you, I was at work all day.

114
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,870
<4-22,Monica>明白  你打算什么时候跟他们说这件事
<4-22,Monica>Got you. When do we tell them?

115
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,100
<4-23,Chandler>先不告诉  没有十成的把握
<4-23,Chandler>We don't. Not until it's 100 percent.

116
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,630
<4-23,Chandler>干嘛弄得大家都难受
<4-23,Chandler>Why upset everybody over nothing?

117
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,930
<4-24,Monica>嗯  好的
<4-24,Monica>Okay. Right.

118
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:02,310
<4-24,Monica>天啊  这将非常难以开口
<4-24,Monica>Oh, my God, that is gonna be so hard.

119
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,740
<4-25,Chandler>我知道  所以祝你顺利吧
<4-25,Chandler>I know. Good luck with it.

120
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:10,510
<5-1,Ross>我就是不明白钱德勒为什么搞外遇
<5-1,Ross>I just can't see Chandler cheating.

121
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,440
<5-2,Rachel>告诉你们吧  我们一直跟踪他们
<5-2,Rachel>I'm telling you guys, we followed them

122
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:14,140
<5-2,Rachel>到一所位于韦斯特切斯特的房子的外面
<5-2,Rachel>out to a house in Westchester.

123
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:16,150
<5-2,Rachel>他们在里面待了有45分钟
<5-2,Rachel>They went in for 45 minutes,

124
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,700
<5-2,Rachel>出来的时候两人看上去都很高兴
<5-2,Rachel>and then they came out looking pretty happy.

125
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:21,910
<5-2,Rachel>钱德勒
<5-2,Rachel>Chandler?

<5-3,Joey>Forty-five minutes?

127
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,560
<5-3,Joey>肯定有什么地方不对
<5-3,Joey>Well, something's not right.

128
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,710
<5-3,Joey>我不敢相信他这样对莫尼卡
<5-3,Joey>I can't believe he'd do this to Monica.

129
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,160
<5-4,Ross>是啊  而且他们就快有小孩儿了
<5-4,Ross>I know, and with the baby coming?

130
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:34,260
<5-5,Phoebe>那我们该不该告诉莫尼卡
<5-5,Phoebe>So should we tell her?

131
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,070
<5-5,Phoebe>我不知道
<5-5,Phoebe>I don't know.

132
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:38,520
<5-6,Ross>菲比  如果我们看到迈克跟另一个女人在一起
<5-6,Ross>Phoebe, if one of us saw Mike with another woman,

133
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:39,810
<5-6,Ross>我们应不应该告诉你
<5-6,Ross>would you want us to tell you?

134
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,490
<5-7,Phoebe>什么  你看到他跟谁在一起了
<5-7,Phoebe>Why? Who'd you see him with?

135
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,000
<5-8,Ross>没有  我只是说
<5-8,Ross>No one. I'm just saying if we did--

136
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:45,730
<5-9,Phoebe>告诉我你知道些什么
<5-9,Phoebe>Tell me what you know!

00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:47,630
<5-8,Ross>没谁  没有
<5-8,Ross>No one! Nothing!

138
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,350
<5-10,Ross>迈克是个好人  我只是在假设
<5-10,Ross>Mike's a great guy! It was hypothetical!

139
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,850
<5-11,Phoebe>好了  他是个好人
<5-11,Phoebe>All right. He is a good guy.

140
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,800
<5-11,Phoebe>你是对的  他不会搞外遇
<5-11,Phoebe>You're right. He wouldn't cheat.

141
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,190
<5-12,Ross>如果我真看到他跟另一个女人在一起
<5-12,Ross>If I did see him with someone,

142
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,060
<5-12,Ross>我也绝不会
<5-12,Ross>there's no way l--

143
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,590
<5-13,Phoebe >你看见他跟谁在一起了
<5-13,Phoebe >Who did you see him with?

144
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,810
<6-1,Rachel>看看她  多开心啊
<6-1,Rachel>Oh, look at her. So happy.

145
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,100
<6-2,Monica>要是有更小的
<6-2,Monica>If only there were a smaller one

146
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,170
<6-2,Monica>来清理这个该有多好
<6-2,Monica>to clean this one.

147
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,540
<6-3,Joey>钱德勒在吗
<6-3,Joey>Hey, is Chandler here?

148
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:30,950
<6-4,Monica>不在  他去买饭了
<6-4,Monica>No, he's picking up dinner.

149
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,850
<6-4,Monica>怎么了  出什么事了吗
<6-4,Monica>Why? What's up?

150
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:37,570
<6-5,Phoebe>无论发生什么事
<6-5,Phoebe>Look, whatever happens,

151
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,810
<6-5,Phoebe>我们都跟你在一起  我们爱你
<6-5,Phoebe>we're here for you, and we love you.

152
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,350
<6-5,Phoebe>好
<6-5,Phoebe>All right.

153
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,390
<6-6,Ross>我想钱德勒可能有外遇了
<6-6,Ross>Chandler might be having an affair.

154
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,600
<6-7,Monica>什么
<6-7,Monica>What?

155
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:48,400
<6-8,Rachel>菲比和我今天
<6-8,Rachel>Phoebe and I saw Chandler...

156
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:49,830
<6-8,Rachel>在街上
<6-8,Rachel>...with a blond woman today

157
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,770
<6-8,Rachel>看见钱德勒和一个金发女郎在一起
<6-8,Rachel>outside on the street.

158
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,220
<6-8,Rachel>然后我们跟踪他们到了
<6-8,Rachel>And then we followed them

159
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:55,090
<6-8,Rachel>一所位于韦斯特切斯特的房子
<6-8,Rachel>to a house in Westchester.

160
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,640
<6-9,Phoebe>他们一起进去了
<6-9,Phoebe>They went in together.

161
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,100
<6-9,Phoebe>很抱歉
<6-9,Phoebe>I'm so sorry.

162
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,570
<6-10,Monica>我的天啊

<6-10,Monica>我的天啊  这太糟糕了
<6-10,Monica>Oh, my God, that's awful.

164
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:08,910
<6-10,Monica>你们觉得那房子怎么样
<6-10,Monica>What did you think of the house?

165

<6-12,Joey>莫尼卡  你明白
<6-12,Joey>Monica, you understand

167
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,880
<6-12,Joey>我们刚才说的话  对不对
<6-12,Joey>what we're saying, right?

168
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:18,330
<6-13,Monica>明白  当然明白
<6-13,Monica>Yeah. Sure.

169
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,360
<6-13,Monica>明显对我是毁灭性的打击
<6-13,Monica>I mean, I'm devastated, obviously.

170
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,980
<6-13,Monica>你们觉得那附近住人舒服不
<6-13,Monica>Did you think the neighborhood was homey?

171
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:28,080
<6-14,Chandler>嘿
<6-14,Chandler>Hey.

172
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:29,950
<6-15,Joey>你这个狗杂种
<6-15,Joey>You son of a bitch.

173
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:32,910
<6-16,Chandler>只是我自己这么觉得
<6-16,Chandler>Is it me,

174
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,910
<6-16,Chandler>还是我们打招呼的用语
<6-16,Chandler>or have the greetings

175
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,840
<6-16,Chandler>真的在走下坡路

00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,680
<6-17,Monica>他们以为你和她有一腿
<6-17,Monica>They think you're having an affair.

179
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:42,960
<6-18,Rachel>谁是南茜
<6-18,Rachel>Who's Nancy?

180
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:43,830

00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,560
<6-22,Joey>跟一个女人做45分钟那么长
<6-22,Joey>for 45 minutes!

193
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:17,180
<6-26,Rachel>你是说真的
<6-26,Rachel>Are you serious?

194
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,110
<6-27,Monica>当我们发现我们
<6-27,Monica>When we found out

195
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,460
<6-27,Monica>马上就要有小孩儿了
<6-27,Monica>that we were gonna get this baby...

196
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:21,320
<6-27,Monica>我和钱德勒商量过了
<6-27,Monica>...Chandler and I decided

197
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:23,530
<6-27,Monica>我们决定不能在市区抚养我们的小孩儿
<6-27,Monica>we didn't want to raise a kid in the city.

198
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,650
<6-28,Phoebe>所以你们要搬出去
<6-28,Phoebe>So you're-- So you're gonna move?

199
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,300
<6-29,Ross>我的天
<6-29,Ross>Oh, my God.

200
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:31,250
<6-30,Joey>这种事我们总要投票解决吧
<6-30,Joey>Shouldn't we all vote on stuff like this?

201
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:34,990
<6-31,Rachel>在市区里带小孩儿有什么不妥吗
<6-31,Rachel>What is wrong with raising a kid in the city?

202
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,270
<6-31,Rachel>我就这样啊
<6-31,Rachel>I'm doing it.

203
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,520
<6-31,Rachel>罗斯也这样
<6-31,Rachel>Ross is doing it.

205
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:40,020
<6-31,Rachel>莎拉·杰西卡·派克也是这么干的
<6-31,Rachel>Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it!

206
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,610
<6-32,Monica>对你们来说这没什么问题
<6-32,Monica>And that's great for you guys,

207
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,760
<6-32,Monica>但是我们想要给孩子一片草地和一个的秋千
<6-32,Monica>but we want a lawn and a swing set.

208
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:45,910
<6-33,Chandler>还有一条小孩
<6-33,Chandler>A street where our kids

209
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,060
<6-33,Chandler>可以在上面骑单车的马路
<6-33,Chandler>can ride their bikes...

210
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,000
<6-33,Chandler>不时还会有雪糕车经过
<6-33,Chandler>...and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by.

211
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:51,550
<6-34,Ross>所以你们想买一栋50年代的房子
<6-34,Ross>So you want to buy a house in the '50s.

212
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,740
<6-35,Phoebe>你们有没有想过
<6-35,Phoebe>Have you thought about

213
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:55,860
<6-35,Phoebe>你们正放弃什么
<6-35,Phoebe>what you're giving up?

214
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,900
<6-35,Phoebe>你们不能搬出市区  如果...
<6-35,Phoebe>You can't move out of the city. What if--?

215
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,560
<6-35,Phoebe>如果你们想凌晨五点钟吃中餐怎么办
<6-35,Phoebe>What if you want Chinese food at 5 a.m.?

216
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:01,780
<6-35,Phoebe>又或者想买一块
<6-35,Phoebe>Or a fake Rolex

217
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:03,530
<6-35,Phoebe>一下雨就散架的假劳力士怎么办
<6-35,Phoebe>that breaks as soon as it rains?

218
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,180
<6-35,Phoebe>又或者一个电话就能到的
<6-35,Phoebe>Or an Asian hooker

219
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:06,600
<6-35,Phoebe>亚洲应召女郎呢
<6-35,Phoebe>sent right to your door?

220
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:08,870
<6-36,Ross>知道吗
<6-36,Ross>You know what?

221
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,430
<6-36,Ross>如果你们只是想看看房子  没问题
<6-36,Ross>If you want to look for a house, that's okay.

222
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,110
<6-37,Joey>不  不  不  别听他的
<6-37,Joey>No! No, it's not! Don't listen to him.

223
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,190
<6-37,Joey>小心我扁你
<6-37,Joey>I'm gonna thump you.

224
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,690
<6-37,Joey>的确是没问题
<6-37,Joey>It's okay,

225
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,870
<6-38,Ross>因为他们必须得把想搬走的这心情发泄出来
<6-38,Ross>because they have to get it out of their system.

226
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:22,130
<6-38,Ross>你们会发现
<6-38,Ross>Okay? But you're gonna realize

227
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:25,220
<6-38,Ross>这里才是你们真正想要住的地方
<6-38,Ross>this is the only place you want to be.

228
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:28,280
<6-39,Chandler>实际上...
<6-39,Chandler>Actually...

229
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,780
<6-39,Chandler>我们已经找到合我们心意的房子了
<6-39,Chandler>...we already found a house we love.

230
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,230
<6-40,Ross>什么
<6-40,Ross>What?

231
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,580
<6-41,Monica>大约一小时以前
<6-41,Monica>About an hour ago,

232
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:35,250
<6-41,Monica>我们开出了我们的价码
<6-41,Monica>we made an offer.

233
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:42,990
<6-42,Chandler>我想你们现在
<6-42,Chandler>Bet you wish I was having

234
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:44,640
<6-42,Chandler>宁可我有外遇了吧
<6-42,Chandler>an affair now, huh?

235
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,540
<6-43,Ross>你们已经开出价码了
<6-43,Ross>You put an offer on a house?

236
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:54,160
<6-43,Ross>那房子真的很好
<6-43,Ross>It's so sweet.

237
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:55,120
<6-44,Monica>的确是
<6-44,Monica>It really is.

238
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:56,280
<6-44,Monica>那里有一个很大的院子
<6-44,Monica>It has this big yard

239
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,910
<6-44,Monica>一直通到一条小溪
<6-44,Monica>that leads down to this stream.

240
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,970
<6-44,Monica>那里还有很多老枫树
<6-44,Monica>And then there's these old maple trees.

241
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:00,930
<6-45,Phoebe>跟自然环境有什么关系
<6-45,Phoebe>Oh, again with the nature.

242
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,180
<6-45,Phoebe>你们又不是海狸
<6-45,Phoebe>What are you, beavers?

243
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:05,050
<6-46,Chandler>我知道你们一时很难接受我们的决定
<6-46,Chandler>Look, I know this is really hard,

244
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,190
<6-46,Chandler>我们也非常的抱歉
<6-46,Chandler>and we're really sorry.

245
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,570
<6-47,Joey>是不是因为我常不敲门
<6-47,Joey>Is this because I come over here

246
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,540
<6-47,Joey>就过来拿你们的东西吃?
<6-47,Joey>without knocking and eat your food?

247
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:11,520
<6-47,Joey>我可以不那样做
<6-47,Joey>Because I can stop doing that.

248
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,870
<6-47,Joey>我真的可以改
<6-47,Joey>I really, really think I can.

249
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,620
<6-48,Chandler>乔伊  你知道这不是我们要搬出去住的原因
<6-48,Chandler>You know that's not the reason, Joe.

250
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,140
<6-49,Monica>我想如果你们到实地看一看的话
<6-49,Monica>I think if you saw it,

251
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,150
<6-49,Monica>你们会明白的
<6-49,Monica>you'd understand.

252
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,290
<6-49,Monica>你们俩去看过
<6-49,Monica>You guys were there.

253
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,660
<6-49,Monica>那的确很美  不是吗
<6-49,Monica>It's beautiful, isn't it?

254
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,000
<6-50,Rachel>是  确实是很美
<6-50,Rachel>Yeah, it is.

00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:34,670
<7-69,Monica>这是你最后一箱衣服
<7-69,Monica>This is the last box of your clothes.

393
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,050
<7-69,Monica>我会在上面贴个标签
<7-69,Monica>I'm just gonna label it

394
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,500
<7-69,Monica>写"你在想什么"
<7-69,Monica>"What were you thinking?"

395
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:41,480
<7-70,Rachel>有趣  因为我正想到对门去
<7-70,Rachel>I was gonna go across the hall

396
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:43,090
<7-70,Rachel>在钱德勒身上也写上这句话
<7-70,Rachel>and write that on Chandler.

397

<7-71,Phoebe>二位  我不想把事情搞砸
<7-71,Phoebe>Guys, I don't mean to make things worse, but...

398
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,750
<7-71,Phoebe>但是我不想跟瑞秋住在一起了
<7-71,Phoebe>...l don't want to live with Rachel anymore.

00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,620
<7-72,Monica and Rachel>-什么  -什么
<7-72,Monica and Rachel>-What? -What?

400
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:53,720
<7-73,Phoebe>你们对对方太刻薄了
<7-73,Phoebe>You're so mean to each other.

401
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:55,840
<7-73,Phoebe>我也不想像现在这样  弄得跟瑞秋不欢而散
<7-73,Phoebe>I don't wanna end up like that with Rachel.

402
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,140
<7-73,Phoebe>我还是喜欢你
<7-73,Phoebe>I still like you.

403
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:00,140
<7-74,Rachel>菲比  那没关系  因为我不搬了
<7-74,Rachel>That's fine because I'm not moving.

404
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:02,810
<7-75,Monica>菲比  你得跟把她带走
<7-75,Monica>Phoebe, you gotta take her.

405

<7-75,Monica>你知道  我是曾说过一些她的坏话
<7-75,Monica>You know, I know I said some bad stuff...

406
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,270
<7-75,Monica>但是  瑞秋还是有很多优点的
<7-75,Monica>...but Rachel has qualities

407
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,430
<7-75,Monica>这足以让她成为一个好的室友
<7-75,Monica>that make her a good roommate.

408
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,610
<7-75,Monica>她有很多商品目录
<7-75,Monica>She gets tons of catalogs and she folds

409
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:14,320
<7-75,Monica>她会把那些她认为我会喜欢的产品所在页折起来
<7-75,Monica>she folds down the pages of things she thinks I'd like.

410
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:15,850
<7-76,Phoebe>还有呢
<7-76,Phoebe>What else?

411

00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:21,800
<7-77,Monica>她会在镜子上给我留言
<7-77,Monica>...she leaves me notes on the mirror.

413
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,900
<7-78,Rachel>是  我确实这么干
<7-78,Rachel>I do. I do do that.

414
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:25,960
<7-79,Phoebe>很好
<7-79,Phoebe>That's nice.

415
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,300
<7-79,Phoebe>我喜欢在洗手间里有东西读
<7-79,Phoebe>I like having things to read in the bathroom.

416
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:33,490
<7-80,Monica>当我看完书在沙发上睡着的时候
<7-80,Monica>When I fall asleep on the couch...

417
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,360
<7-80,Monica>她会为我盖上毯子
<7-80,Monica>...she covers me with a blanket.

418
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:40,480
<7-81,Rachel>你知道啦  我不想凉着你
<7-81,Rachel>Well, you know, I don't want you to be cold.

419
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:44,820
<7-82,Monica>还有  当我告诉她
<7-82,Monica>And when I told her

420
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:46,570
<7-82,Monica>我要搬过去跟钱德勒一起住的时候
<7-82,Monica>that I was gonna move in with Chandler...

421
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,870
<7-82,Monica>她真的是很支持我
<7-82,Monica>...she was really supportive.

422
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,230
<7-82,Monica>你太好了
<7-82,Monica>You were so great.

423
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,120
<7-82,Monica>你把一件困难的事情变得轻松简单
<7-82,Monica>You made it so easy.

424
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,530
<7-82,Monica>但现在你却要走了
<7-82,Monica>And now you have to leave.

425
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:05,110
<7-82,Monica>而我得和男生住一起
<7-82,Monica>And I have to live with a boy!

00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:24,090
<7-84,Monica>-她真的走了  -我知道
<7-84,Monica>- She really left. - I know.

<7-87,Chandler>-谢谢  -没问题  室友
<7-87,Chandler>- Thank you. - No problem, roomie.

<7-88,Monica>-我能问你一个问题吗  -当然
<7-88,Monica>- Can I ask you a question? - Sure.

429
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,980
<7-90,Monica>那只狗在那儿干什么
<7-90,Monica>What the hell is that dog doing here?

430
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,670
<7-90,Monica>我来说点祝酒词吧
<7-90,Monica>A little toast here. Ding, ding!

431
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:48,610
<7-91,Chandler>我知道这并不是
<7-91,Chandler>I know this isn't exactly

432
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,520
<7-91,Chandler>你们所计划的感恩节
<7-91,Chandler>the kind of Thanksgiving you planned...

433
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:54,080
<7-91,Chandler>但对于我来说  这个节真的是太棒了
<7-91,Chandler>...but for me this has been really great.

434
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:56,140
<7-81,Rachel>知道吗  可能是因为这个节
<7-81,Rachel>You know, I think because

435
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:58,170
<7-91,Chandler>没有人离婚
<7-91,Chandler>it didn't involve divorce...

436
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,600
<7-91,Chandler>吐得一塌糊涂
<7-91,Chandler>...or projectile vomiting.

437
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:03,240
<7-91,Chandler>无论怎样  我只是在想
<7-91,Chandler>Anyway, I think if

438
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:04,180
<7-91,Chandler>如果你们去了韦尔县
<7-91,Chandler>you had gone to Vail...

439
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:06,320
<7-91,Chandler>如果你们和你们的家人在一起
<7-91,Chandler>...or if you had been with your family,

440
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:07,750
<7-91,Chandler>如果你"没有"
<7-91,Chandler>or if you didn't have...

441
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,300
<7-91,Chandler>梅毒什么的
<7-91,Chandler>...syphilis and stuff...

442
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,640
<7-91,Chandler>我们就不可能在一起  对不对
<7-91,Chandler>...we wouldn't be all together.

443
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:16,920
<7-91,Chandler>所以  我想我要说的是
<7-91,Chandler>So I guess what I'm trying to say is...

444
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:19,090
<7-91,Chandler>我很感激你们
<7-91,Chandler>...that I'm very thankful

445
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,890
<7-91,Chandler>因为你们的感恩节计划全砸了
<7-91,Chandler>that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.

446
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:26,350
<7-92,All>-太感人了  -谢啦
<7-92,All>- That's so sweet! - Thank you.

447
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,080
<7-93,Ross>为糟糕的圣诞节干杯
<7-93,Ross>Here's to a lousy Christmas!

448
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:32,690
<7-94,Rachel>也为糟糕的新年
<7-94,Rachel>And a crappy New Year!

451
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,280
<8-1,Rachel>你们就是不能这样做
<8-1,Rachel>You just-- You just can't.

452
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:44,120
<8-2,Joey>瑞秋说得对
<8-2,Joey>Rachel's right.

453
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:45,990
<8-2,Joey>你们俩是属于这里的
<8-2,Joey>This is where you guys belong.

<8-3,Phoebe>是啊  你们肯定不会想住到韦斯特切斯特
<8-3,Phoebe>Yeah.You don't wanna live in Westchester.

455
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,650
<8-3,Phoebe>感觉那是最糟糕的切斯特
<8-3,Phoebe>That's the worst of the Chesters.

456
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:51,770
<8-3,Phoebe>知道吗
<8-3,Phoebe>You know,

457
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,600
<8-4,Ross>有时我独自一人在我的寓所的时候
<8-4,Ross>sometimes when I'm alone in my apartment,

458
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:54,580
<8-4,Ross>望向这边
<8-4,Ross>I look over here...

<8-4,Ross>你们正在吃晚餐

460
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:00,800
<8-4,Ross>看电视或是做着其它什么事
<8-4,Ross>...or watching TV or something...

461
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,610
<8-4,Ross>这会让我感觉好很多
<8-4,Ross>...but it makes me feel better.

462
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,790
<8-4,Ross>你们搬走后  我再望过来的时候
<8-4,Ross>And now when I look over,

465
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,860

<8-4,Ross>They don't make me feel so good.

466
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,710
<8-5,Rachel>是啊  所以别搬了
