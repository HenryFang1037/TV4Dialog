<2-18,Monica>我就知道你听了心里会有疙瘩

266
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:36,290
<3-1,Rachel>这不是在勾引你一夜情
<3-1,Rachel>that this is not an invitation to the physical act of love.

267
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,160
<3-2,Ross>对  真是太爆笑了

270
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,310
<3-5,Rachel>不尽然啦
<3-5,Rachel>No, not really.

271
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,730
<3-7,Rachel>只是我没那么容易觉得丢脸

<3-9,Rachel>No, I don't! Ross,

274
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:58,880
<3-9,Rachel>这是因为我比你更有安全感
<3-9,Rachel>I think I'm just a more secure person than you are.

275
00:14:58,930 --> 00:14:59,670
<3-10,Ross>是吗
<3-10,Ross>Is that so?

279
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,770
<4-1,Joey>在古罗马时代  这不只是顶帽子而已
<4-1,Joey>Hey, y'know in Roman times this was more than just a hat.

283
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:26,430
<4-3,Joey>抹去鞋子上的泥巴
<4-3,Joey>They would use it to get the mud off their shoe.

284
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,530
<4-3,Joey>有时候马肚子会弄脏
<4-3,Joey>And sometimes underneath the horse would get dirty

285
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,480
<4-3,Joey>-把这个戮进去就能...  -乔伊
<4-3,Joey>- so they would stick it right... - Joey, I uh!

<4-5,Joey>那我带你去个好地方
<4-5,Joey>All right well, I'll take you someplace nice then.

<4-5,Joey>今天有个人给我一百块的小费
<4-5,Joey>Look! A guy tipped me a hundred bucks today.

<4-7,Joey>就赢了五千块  你相信吗  五千块
<4-7,Joey>and he won $5,000. Can you believe that? $5,000!

291
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:48,110
<4-8,Chandler>如果我赢了五千  我就去加入健身房
<4-8,Chandler>Y'know, if I won $5,000 I'd join a gym,

292
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,870
<4-8,Chandler>把我的上半身练壮
<4-8,Chandler>y'know build up my upper body

293
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,800
<4-8,Chandler>再用棍子捅理查德的屁股
<4-8,Chandler>and hit Richard from behind with a stick!

294
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:56,510
<4-9,Joey>等等  我何不效法那个人
<4-9,Joey>Wait a minute! Why don't I do what that guy did?

295
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,120
<4-9,Joey>把这一百变成五千
<4-9,Joey>I'll take this $100 and turn it into $5,000!

296
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:01,130
<4-9,Joey>五千再变成够拍电影的钱
<4-9,Joey>And then I'll turn that into enough money

297
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:02,640
<4-9,Joey>那电影就能重新开拍了
<4-9,Joey>to get my movie going again!

298
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,120
<4-10,Chandler>祝你好运了
<4-10,Chandler>Good luck!

299
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:07,370
<4-11,Joey>钱德勒  我不需要好运  我已经想透了
<4-11,Joey>Chandler! I don't need luck. I have thought this through!

300
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,150
<4-12,Chandler>我懂了
<4-12,Chandler>I see.

301
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:19,280
<5-2,Phoebe>不敢相信  今晚真是糟透了
<5-2,Phoebe>I can't believe this! This is like the worst night ever!

302
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:21,730
<5-3,Monica>莫妮卡  你和钱德勒的关系
<5-3,Monica>Y'know Monica you had a minor setback

303
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,200
<5-4,Phoebe>有了小小挫折
<5-4,Phoebe>in your relationship with Chandler.

304
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,210
<5-4,Phoebe>有什么大不了  不过是钱德勒罢了
<5-4,Phoebe>Big deal! It's only Chandler.

305
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:29,010
<5-4,Phoebe>我真的很遗憾
<5-4,Phoebe>I am so sorry.

306
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,580
<5-5,Monica>真离谱  我们吵架的理由太蠢了
<5-5,Monica>This is crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid argument.

307
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:36,490
<5-5,Monica>我根本不想再跟理查德见面了
<5-5,Monica>I don't even wanna see Richard again.

308
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:39,150
<5-6,Phoebe>那就去挽回啊  去找钱德勒
<5-6,Phoebe>So go fix it! Go find Chandler!

309
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:41,600
<5-6,Phoebe>他八成就待在你们的房间里
<5-6,Phoebe>He's probably up in your room!

310
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:43,880
<5-6,Phoebe>跟他说对不起  说你爱他
<5-6,Phoebe>Tell him that you're sorry and that you love him.

341
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:05,430
<9-5,Joey>发牌员的手跟我一模一样
<9-5,Joey>the dealer's hands were exactly like me!

342
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:07,780
<9-5,Joey>就跟照镜子没两样
<9-5,Joey>It-it was like looking at my hands in a mirror!

343
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:12,490
<9-6,Chandler>你确定不是在照镜子吗
<9-6,Chandler>Are you sure you weren't  looking at your hands in a mirror?

344
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,110
<9-7,Joey>你不懂这件事的意义吗
<9-7,Joey>Don't you see what this means?!

345
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,510
<9-7,Joey>我大可忘了那部蠢电影
<9-7,Joey>I can forget about that stupid movie.

348
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,330
<9-9,Joey>我还没有完全想出来
<9-9,Joey>Look, I don't have it all worked out yet,

349
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,230
<9-9,Joey>不过保证很有赚头

<9-11,Joey>Okay, how much would you pay to see this hand twice?

355
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,010
<9-12,Chandler>乔伊  我说不出个价钱
<9-12,Chandler>Y'know, I-I can't really put a price on that Joe.

368
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,780
<9-24,Chandler>或许在跟理查德说话吧
<9-24,Chandler>Yeah, well, she's probably talking to Richard.
