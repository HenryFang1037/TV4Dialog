<1-17,Phoebe>莫妮卡  你为什么告诉大家你没有怀孕
<1-17,Phoebe>Hey, Mon, why'd you tell the guys that you weren't pregnant?

21
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:58,380
<1-18,Monica>因为我本来就没怀

23
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:08,780
<1-19,Phoebe>那是因为我怀孕了

<1-22,Phoebe>I didn't wanna steal your thunder.

28
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,620
<1-23,Monica>于是你就告诉大家我怀孕了
<1-23,Monica>So you told people I was pregnant?

<1-27,Monica>- Why? - Why not?

33
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:37,490
<1-29,Phoebe>我不能说  因为他是名人
<1-29,Phoebe>I can't say because he's famous.

34

<1-30,Rachel>天啊  是哪个名人

<2-1,Photographer>莫妮卡  请你先到旁边
<2-1,Photographer>Monica, if you step away,

61
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,880
<2-8,Phoebe>于是你告诉我莫妮卡怀孕了
<2-8,Phoebe>So instead you told me Monica was pregnant?

62
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,600
<2-9,Rachel>是你说她怀孕了  我只是没反驳你罢了

151
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:51,500

<7-17,Mona>你刚刚给我看时是那样拿的...
<7-17,Mona>See, before, when you showed it to me, you held it that way...

157
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:31,750
<7-18,Ross>我被你误导了
<7-18,Ross>...which was misleading.

158
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,320
<7-18,Ross>你们好
<7-18,Ross>Hello.

159

<8-1,Joey>Will you see if your mom

160
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,200
<8-1,Joey>拿给丹尼斯·菲利浦斯吗
<8-1,Joey>can give my resume to Dennis Phillips?

161
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,150
<8-1,Joey>只要能演百老汇舞台剧  我就什么戏都演过了
<8-1,Joey>If I could get in a Broadway show, then I would've done it all.

162
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:00,190
<8-1,Joey>电影  电视剧跟舞台剧
<8-1,Joey>Film, television and theater.

163
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:01,640
<8-1,Joey>唯一的例外是广播剧
<8-1,Joey>The only thing left would be radio.

164
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:03,380
<8-1,Joey>那是留给丑八怪演的
<8-1,Joey>But that's just for ugly people.

165
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:08,400
<8-2,Chandler>-你穿几号鞋  -11号  11号半
<8-2,Chandler>- What size shoes do you wear? - 11, 11 half.

166
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,830
<8-4,Chandler>我的鞋子太滑没办法跳舞
<8-4,Chandler>Great. My shoes give me a problem on the dance floor.

167
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,540
<8-4,Chandler>你的戏靴能借我吗
<8-4,Chandler>Can I borrow your boots from your costume?

168
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:16,050
<8-5,Joey>我真不知道把靴子丢到哪里去了  抱歉
<8-5,Joey>I don't really even know where I left those. Sorry.

169
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:19,630
<8-6,Chandler>你的脚不可能是11号半
<8-6,Chandler>Those aren't 11 half.

170
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:21,440
<8-7,Joey>好吧  我穿七号的鞋子
<8-7,Joey>Okay, fine, I'm a 7!

171
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:23,850
<8-7,Joey>我的脚出奇的小
<8-7,Joey>I have surprisingly small feet.

172
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:25,850
<8-7,Joey>但其它部份都很大  我可以露给你看
<8-7,Joey>But the rest of me is good. I'll show you.

173
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:31,010
<9-1,Monica>你能相信菲比怀孕了吗
<9-1,Monica>Can you believe Phoebe got pregnant?

174
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:33,890
<9-2,Rachel>现在别谈那件事了
<9-2,Rachel>You know what, honey? Let's not talk about that right now.

175
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:35,210
<9-3,Monica>这可是爆炸性新闻
<9-3,Monica>This is so huge.

176
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:37,560
<9-4,Rachel>没错  但那也没有你的婚礼重要
<9-4,Rachel>Sure, but as big as your wedding?

177
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,700
<9-5,Monica>当然  我的婚礼最重要了
<9-5,Monica>Of course not. Nothing is.

178
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,490
<9-6,Rachel>说句悄悄话  到了这个时代...
<9-6,Rachel>Between me and you, in this day and age...

179
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:46,320
<9-7,Monica>谁会笨到让自己怀孕
<9-7,Monica>...how dumb do you have to be to get pregnant?

180
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,960
<9-8,Rachel>有时候你该做的都做了
<9-8,Rachel>You know? Sometimes you can do everything right.

181
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,070
<9-8,Rachel>双方都戴上了该戴的东西
<9-8,Rachel>Everyone wears what they're supposed to wear...

182
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:53,530
<9-8,Rachel>但有个小家伙还是攻过了城池
<9-8,Rachel>...and one of those little guys just gets through.

183
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:55,680
<9-9,Monica>怎么会呢
<9-9,Monica>How?

184
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,030
<9-10,Rachel>我不知道  或许它们有什么工具
<9-10,Rachel>I don't know. Maybe they have tools.

185
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:03,120
<9-11,Monica>我跟她谈过  她要把孩子生下来
<9-11,Monica>Well, I talked to her, and she's definitely gonna have the baby.

186
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,460
<9-11,Monica>她说她要自己抚养孩子
<9-11,Monica>She said she's gonna raise it on her own.

187
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,550
<9-12,Rachel>或许那真的很勇敢
<9-12,Rachel>Well, maybe that's really brave.

188
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:12,660
<9-13,Monica>或许吧  我只是希望她知道那有多辛苦
<9-13,Monica>Maybe. I just hope she realizes how hard it's gonna be.

189
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:18,470
<9-14,Rachel>或许她没有想那么多
<9-14,Rachel>Maybe she hasn't really thought it through that much.

190
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,360
<9-15,Monica>的确有很多事需要考虑
<9-15,Monica>Well, there's a lot to think about.

191
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,010
<9-15,Monica>她要怎么解决经济问题
<9-15,Monica>How is she gonna handle this financially?

192
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,460
<9-15,Monica>她怎么能应付得了工作
<9-15,Monica>How is she gonna juggle work?

193
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,870
<9-15,Monica>她知道她在未来的18年内
<9-15,Monica>Does she realize she's not gonna have a date again

194
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:31,680
<9-15,Monica>都没法再去约会了吗
<9-15,Monica>for the next, like, 18 years?

195
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,460
<9-16,Rachel>我不知道
<9-16,Rachel>I don't know.

196
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,120
<9-17,Monica>你没事吧
<9-17,Monica>Are you okay?

197
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,220
<9-18,Rachel>我只是想到菲比怀了孕  可怜的菲比
<9-18,Rachel>I'm just thinking about Phoebe. Poor, knocked-up Phoebe.

198
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:48,960
<9-19,Waiter>要喝香槟吗
<9-19,Waiter>Champagne?

199
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:51,120
<9-20,Rachel>好的  谢谢你
<9-20,Rachel>Oh, yes! Thank you very much.

200
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,400
<9-20,Rachel>法国人都是那样喝香槟的
<9-20,Rachel>That's actually how the French drink it.

201
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:17,910
<10-1,Phoebe>我刚刚跟我的情人詹姆斯·布洛林通过电话
<10-1,Phoebe>Well, I just got off the phone with my lover James Brolin.

202
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,290
<10-2,Monica>真的吗
<10-2,Monica>Oh, really?

203
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:23,260
<10-3,Phoebe>他显然娶了一个歌手
<10-3,Phoebe>Yes. Apparently, he is married to some singer.

204
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,760
<10-3,Phoebe>但他说他会为了我离开她
<10-3,Phoebe>But he said he'd leave her for me.

205
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,540
<10-3,Phoebe>我说"詹姆斯·布洛林  你确定吗"
<10-3,Phoebe>And I said, "James, James Brolin, are you sure?"

206
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:31,750
<10-3,Phoebe>詹姆斯·布洛林说...
<10-3,Phoebe>James Brolin said...

207
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,370
<10-4,Monica>怀孕的人是瑞秋
<10-4,Monica>Rachel's really the one who's pregnant?

208
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:34,630
<10-4,Monica>什么
<10-4,Monica>What?!

209
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,250
<10-5,Phoebe>装得那么费劲干嘛
<10-5,Phoebe>Why bother?

210
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,040
<10-6,Monica>-你感觉如何  -我不知道我有什么感觉
<10-6,Monica>- How do you feel? - I don't know. I don't know how I feel.

211
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,390
<10-7,Rachel>一切都发生得太快了
<10-7,Rachel>This is all happening so fast.

212
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:46,910
<10-7,Rachel>我得做出许多我不想做的决定
<10-7,Rachel>I have to make all these decisions that I don't wanna make.

213
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:50,370
<10-7,Rachel>谁快把这玩意拿走
<10-7,Rachel>Someone just take this away from me!

214
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:53,990
<10-8,Phoebe>-冷静点  或许你没有怀孕  -什么
<10-8,Phoebe>- Calm down. Maybe you're not pregnant. - What?!

215
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:55,580
<10-10,Phoebe>我怀三胞胎的时候
<10-10,Phoebe>When I got pregnant with the triplets,

216
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:58,290
<10-10,Phoebe>也验了三次孕才确定
<10-10,Phoebe>I took that test, like, three times just to make sure.

217
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:00,540
<10-11,Monica>对  或许是假警报
<10-11,Monica>Yes. Maybe it's a false positive.

218
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,550
<10-11,Monica>你确定你在验孕棒上尿的方式没错吗
<10-11,Monica>Are you sure you peed on the stick right?

219
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:05,520
<10-12,Rachel>不然我要怎么尿才对
<10-12,Rachel>How many ways are there to do that?

220
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,910
<10-13,Phoebe>我是说在没有百分之百确定前别大惊小怪
<10-13,Phoebe>I'm just saying, don't freak out until you're 100 percent sure.

221
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,330
<10-14,Rachel>好吧  我回家后会再验一次
<10-14,Rachel>All right, I'll take it again when I get home.

222
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:14,600
<10-15,Monica>你可以现在验
<10-15,Monica>You gotta take it now.

223
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,280
<10-15,Monica>就当成送我的礼物吧
<10-15,Monica>Do it as a present to me.

224
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:19,570
<10-16,Rachel>-好吧  谢谢你  -好的
<10-16,Rachel>- Okay, thank you. - Okay.

225
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,600
<10-18,Phoebe>我去帮你买验孕棒
<10-18,Phoebe>I'll run out and get you one.

226
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,370
<10-19,Rachel>你们真是太好了
<10-19,Rachel>You girls are so great.

227
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:24,920
<10-20,Monica>等一下  孩子他爸是谁
<10-20,Monica>Wait a minute. Who's the father?

228
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,170
<10-21,Phoebe>她不肯告诉我们
<10-21,Phoebe>She won't tell us.

229
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:27,750
<10-22,Monica>快说吧  这可是我的婚礼
<10-22,Monica>Come on! It's my wedding.

230
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,410
<10-22,Monica>你可以把这当做是送我的礼物
<10-22,Monica>That could be my present!

231
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:32,060
<10-23,Rachel>我刚刚答应为了你验孕
<10-23,Rachel>I just gave you peeing on a stick.

232
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,030
<10-24,Phoebe>看吧  所以一定要做礼物登记
<10-24,Phoebe>See, this is why you register.

233
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:45,280
<11-1,Ross>又是椅子的声音  好吗  我没放
<11-1,Ross>It was the chair again. Okay? I'm not doing it!

234
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:47,900
<11-1,Ross>这样吧
<11-1,Ross>It was... Look, you know what?

235
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,050
<11-3,Ross>-你想跳舞吗  -好啊
<11-3,Ross>- Would you like to dance? - Sure.

236
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,630
<11-7,Ross>太棒了
<11-7,Ross>Great.

237
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,350
<11-8,Little Girl>-盖勒博士  -我没有放屁
<11-8,Little Girl>- Dr. Geller. - I wasn't farting!

238
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,750
<11-9,Ross>那是我们那一桌玩的小游戏
<11-9,Ross>A little game from our table.

239
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:12,430
<11-10,Little Girl>-什么事  -盖勒博士  你愿意跟我跳舞吗
<11-10,Little Girl>- Yes? - Dr. Geller, will you dance with me?

240
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:19,090
<11-11,Ross>或许待会再说  现在我要跟这位小姐跳舞
<11-11,Ross>Maybe later. Right now, I'm about to dance with this lady.

241
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:20,820
<11-13,Mona>好吧
<11-13,Mona>Okay.

242
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:28,520
<11-14,Ross>除非这位小姐不介意让你插队
<11-14,Ross>Unless this lady wouldn't mind letting you go first.

243

<11-16,Ross>In fact, why don't we try my special way?

246
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:40,010
<11-16,Ross>你可以踩在我的脚上跳舞
<11-16,Ross>You can dance on my feet.

247

<11-18,Ross>-没问题  -是吗  跳上来吧

<11-20,Ross>继续跳
<11-20,Ross>Keep dancing.

250
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:04,980
<12-1,Chandler>世上无人将欣赏到这般舞姿
<12-1,Chandler>And the world will never know.

251
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:08,510
<12-2,Joey>你跟丹尼斯提过我的事了吗
<12-2,Joey>Did you talk to Dennis about me yet?

252
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:10,290
<12-3,Chandler>我跟他提到你非常有天份
<12-3,Chandler>Yes. I told him how talented you were

253
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:12,260
<12-3,Chandler>还有《我们的日子》的事
<12-3,Chandler>and I told him all about Days of our Lives.

254
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:15,640
<12-4,Joey>不不不  你不能把那种事告诉百老汇导演
<12-4,Joey>No, no, no! You don't tell a Broadway guy that!

255
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,650
<12-5,Chandler>现在他会以为我只是个肥皂剧演员
<12-5,Chandler>Now he thinks I'm just a soap actor.

256
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:19,930
<12-5,Chandler>但你不只是肥皂剧演员
<12-5,Chandler>But you're not just a soap actor.

257
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:23,250
<12-5,Chandler>你是长了双小脚的肥皂剧演员
<12-5,Chandler>You are a soap actor with freakishly tiny feet.

258
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,740
<12-7,Little Girl>-谢谢  -不  谢谢你  米兰达
<12-7,Little Girl>- Thank you. - No, thank you, Miranda.

<12-11,Mona>那简直太可爱了
<12-11,Mona>How cute was that?

261
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,960
<12-12,Ross>你在看我们吗
<12-12,Ross>Oh, were you watching?

262
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:46,170
<12-13,Second Girl>下一个能跟我跳吗
<12-13,Second Girl>Can I go next?

264
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,740
<12-15,Mona>好吧  但我要排在她后面
<12-15,Mona>Okay, but I get to hop on after her.

265
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,570
<12-16,Ross>-我一定能"得分" -什么
<12-16,Ross>- I am so gonna score. - What?

266
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,580
<12-18,Ross>我喜欢你的蝴蝶结
<12-18,Ross>I like your bow.

267
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:15,600
<12-19,Joey>我要请大家举杯向莫妮卡及钱德勒致意
<12-19,Joey>I'd like to propose a toast to Monica and Chandler...

268
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,630
<12-19,Joey>他们是全世界最般配的夫妻
<12-19,Joey>...the greatest couple in the world,

269
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,550
<12-19,Joey>也是我最好的朋友
<12-19,Joey>and my best friends.

270
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:22,530
<12-19,Joey>我刚听说他们要结婚时
<12-19,Joey>When I first found out they were getting married,

271
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:25,000
<12-19,Joey>我有点生气
<12-19,Joey>I was... I was a little angry.

272
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,720
<12-19,Joey>我心想"天啊  为什么
<12-19,Joey>I was like, "Why, God? Why?

273
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,800
<12-19,Joey>你为什么要把他们从我身边抢走"
<12-19,Joey>How can you take them away from me!"

274
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,440
<12-19,Joey>然后我回想起我们之间有过的回忆
<12-19,Joey>But then I thought back over all our memories together.

275
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:37,410
<12-19,Joey>快乐的回亿
<12-19,Joey>Some happy memories.

276
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:43,510
<12-19,Joey>还有悲伤的回亿
<12-19,Joey>And there were some sad memories.

277
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,580
<12-19,Joey>对不起
<12-19,Joey>I'm sorry.

278
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:52,200
<12-19,Joey>还有可怕的回亿
<12-19,Joey>And some scared memories.

279
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:03,290
<12-19,Joey>然后我才发现  我永远都会是他们的朋友
<12-19,Joey>And then I realized I'll always be their friend.

280
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:07,090
<12-19,Joey>他们这个朋友会说好几种方言
<12-19,Joey>Their friend who can speak in many dialects...

281
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,430
<12-19,Joey>接受过舞台训练
<12-19,Joey>...and has training in stage combat

282
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:11,770
<12-19,Joey>愿意拍部份裸露的戏份
<12-19,Joey>and is willing to do partial nudity.

283
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,900
<12-19,Joey>敬这对金童玉女
<12-19,Joey>To the happy couple.

284

<12-21,Ross>-谢谢  -刚才跳得很棒  艾许莉

<12-23,Ross>-现在轮到我了吗  -我是下一个
<12-23,Ross>- So, is it my turn now? - I'm next.

<12-30,Ross>你想要做什么  葛特
<12-30,Ross>What are you doing there, Gert?

293
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:01,320
<12-31,Gert>跟其他女孩一样踩在你脚上跳舞
<12-31,Gert>Dancing on your feet like the other girls did it.

<12-33,Gert>你的脚为什么不动
<12-33,Gert>Why aren't you moving your feet?

297
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,190
<12-34,Ross>我在努力了
<12-34,Ross>I'm trying.

298

<12-35,Gert>快一点  你跳得太慢了
<12-35,Gert>Faster. You're not going fast enough.

299
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,120
<12-36,Ross>或许我该踩在你脚上
<12-36,Ross>Maybe I should stand on your feet!

300
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:31,980
<13-1,Joey>你听到我的致词了吗
<13-1,Joey>So did you happen to catch my toast up there?

<13-4,Dennis Phillips>我觉得你不适合这部戏
<13-4,Dennis Phillips>Look, Joey. I don't think you're right for this project.

305
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,330
<13-5,Joey>你这就错了吧
<13-5,Joey>See, that's where you're wrong.

<14-1,Monica>Ready to get back to the dance floor?

313
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,490

<14-4,Chandler>我不希望让别人看到
<14-4,Chandler>For the first time, I didn't want you to be embarrassed

318
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:20,460
<14-4,Chandler>你跟一个跳梁小丑跳舞  丢光了脸
<14-4,Chandler>to be seen on the dance floor with some clumsy idiot.
