21
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:55,360
<1-18,Chandler>什么
<1-18,Chandler>What?

22
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,710
<1-19,Ross>打情骂俏  你不是正要去
<1-19,Ross>The flirting! Aren't you supposed to be going out with,

23
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,600
<1-19,Ross>跟谁来着  跟我妹妹约会吗
<1-19,Ross>I don't know hmm, let's say my sister?!

24
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:02,040
<1-20,Chandler>我没在打情骂俏啊
<1-20,Chandler>I was not flirting.

25
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:04,160
<1-21,Ross>那根本就是打情骂俏
<1-21,Ross>It was totally flirting.

26
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:05,830
<1-8,Chandler>新发型哦
<1-8,Chandler>"Somebody got a haircut "

27
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:11,170
<1-22,Chandler>首先  你模仿得很恐怖
<1-22,Chandler>Okay first of all, the impression, uncanny.

28
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,060
<1-22,Chandler>第二  那不是打情骂俏  只是两个人
<1-22,Chandler>And second, that was not flirting, that was just casual conversation

29
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:16,790
<1-22,Chandler>闲话家常而已
<1-22,Chandler>between two people. That is all.

30
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,440
<1-23,Ross>才怪
<1-23,Ross>Yeah, right.

31
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:20,000
<1-24,Chandler>你要看打情骂俏吗  我示范给你看
<1-24,Chandler>You wanna see flirting? I'll show you flirting.

32
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:22,670
<1-25,Ross>不用了
<1-25,Ross>I'm good.

48
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,920
<2-1,Rachel>我真替乔伊感到骄傲
<2-1,Rachel>I am so proud of Joey,

49
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:19,470
<2-1,Rachel>他竟然参演了《法律与秩序》
<2-1,Rachel>I can't believe he's going to be on Law & Order!

50
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,720
<2-2,Phoebe>可是你不觉得叫《秩序与法律》比较对吗
<2-2,Phoebe>I know. But don't you think that it should be called Order and Law?

51
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:26,660
<2-3,Rachel>不对  得先把人逮捕了才能审讯啊
<2-3,Rachel>No because first they arrest the guy and then they try him.

52
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:28,480
<2-4,Phoebe>我对这点可是窝了一肚子意见
<2-4,Phoebe>Don't get me started on that.

53
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:30,960
<2-5,Chandler>我没在打情骂俏
<2-5,Chandler>I was not flirting.

54
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:33,520
<2-6,Ross>还在纪念日当天  你脸皮真厚
<2-6,Ross>And on your anniversary, for shame!

55
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,140
<2-7,Rachel>怎么了
<2-7,Rachel>What's going on?

56
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,790
<2-8,Ross>钱德勒跟外送辣妹打情骂俏
<2-8,Ross>Chandler was hitting on the hot delivery girl!

57
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,130
<2-9,Chandler>我才没有  老天  闭嘴
<2-9,Chandler>I was not and oh God, shh!

58
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,340
<2-10,Ross>有就是有
<2-10,Ross>Well I'm sorry but you were! Okay?

59
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:45,370
<2-10,Ross>而且就算有谁要跟她搭讪
<2-10,Ross>And besides if anyone should be hitting on her

60
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,420
<2-10,Ross>也应该是单身的男人
<2-10,Ross>it's the guy who's single, the guy that who-

61
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,810
<2-10,Ross>应该是有搞头的人嘛
<2-10,Ross>who-who can do something about it.

62
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:51,680
<2-11,Phoebe>看来有人喜欢披萨外送妹啊
<2-11,Phoebe>Sounds like somebody wants to be Mr. Pizza Delivery Girl.

63
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:56,370
<2-13,Chandler>原来是这样  你喜欢凯特琳
<2-13,Chandler>Is that what this is about? You like Caitlin?

64
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:02,400
<2-14,Rachel>罗斯  我们分手都两年了
<2-14,Rachel>Ross! We broke up two years ago;

65
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,040
<2-14,Rachel>中间你还结过婚
<2-14,Rachel>you've been married since then.

66
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:06,160
<2-14,Rachel>我们各自约会应该没问题吧
<2-14,Rachel>I think it's okay that we see other people.

67
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:11,380
<2-15,Ross>我那天在披萨店看到她
<2-15,Ross>Well, I-I was watching her the other day at the pizza place.

68
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:16,000
<2-17,Ross>她性感又风趣  还有小巧可爱的...
<2-17,Ross>And she's just so sexy and funny and has the cutest little...

69
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:17,810
<2-18,Rachel>三围不用说
<2-18,Rachel>Okay, y'know what? We don't need her measurements.

70
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,970
<2-19,Phoebe>三个都是意式腊肠披萨  罗斯
<2-19,Phoebe>Okay pepperoni, pepperoni, pepperoni, okay Ross,

71
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,490
<2-19,Phoebe>我知道她人美你又爱  但她是不是蠢了点
<2-19,Phoebe>I know she's pretty and you love her, but is she stupid?!

72
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,120
<2-19,Phoebe>她忘了我点的素食披萨
<2-19,Phoebe>She forgot my vegetarian!

73
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:32,580
<2-20,Ross>太完美了  她一定会再来送你的素食披萨
<2-20,Ross>This is perfect! She'll have to come back here with your pizza,

74
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:36,240
<2-20,Ross>到时我就展现出罗斯的魅力
<2-20,Ross>and when she does, I'll turn on the Charm-O-Ross.

75
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,730
<2-20,Ross>我真高兴你不吃肉
<2-20,Ross>Oh I'm so glad you don't eat meat.

76
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,980
<2-21,Phoebe>看吧  吃素对大家都好
<2-21,Phoebe>See? Vegetarianism benefits everyone.

<5-5,Chandler>Oh, I'm so glad we cleared that up.

244
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:26,090
<5-5,Chandler>抱歉  但有些事  是男女有别的
<5-5,Chandler>Look, I'm sorry, but some things are different for men and for women.

245
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,490
<5-6,Monica>继续  教我下什么叫男女有别
<5-6,Monica>Go on, teach me something about men and women.

<5-7,Chandler>好吧  虽然我已经教过你很多了
<5-7,Chandler>Okay, I've already taught you so much already, but whatever.

247
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,960
<5-7,Chandler>你跟男人打情骂俏的时候
<5-7,Chandler>See when you flirt with a guy you think,

248
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,760
<5-7,Chandler>你觉得只是打情骂俏  没啥大不了的
<5-7,Chandler>"I'm just flirting, no big deal."

249
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:36,750
<5-7,Chandler>但对方会觉得
<5-7,Chandler>But the guy is thinking,

250
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,160
<5-7,Chandler>"终于  有人想跟我上床了"
<5-7,Chandler>"Finally! Somebody who wants to sleep with me!"

251
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,750
<5-8,Monica>不可能
<5-8,Monica>No way!

252
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,830
<5-9,Chandler>这是真的
<5-9,Chandler>It's true.

253
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:43,010
<5-10,Monica>真可悲
<5-10,Monica>Well that's pathetic!

254
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,150
<5-11,Chandler>这也是真的
<5-11,Chandler>Again true.

255
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:46,900
<5-12,Monica>男人都这样吗
<5-12,Monica>And this goes for all guys?

256
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:48,090
<5-13,Chandler>醒着的男人都这样
<5-13,Chandler>All guys that are awake.

257
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:51,010
<5-13,Chandler>等我们上床睡觉后
<5-13,Chandler>Then we go to sleep

258
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,490
<5-13,Chandler>世界另一边的男人起床
<5-13,Chandler>and then all the guys from the other end of the world

259
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,430
<5-13,Chandler>继续做一模一样的事
<5-13,Chandler>wake up and behave the exact same way.
