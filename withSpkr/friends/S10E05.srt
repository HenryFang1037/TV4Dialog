00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:08,990
<1-2,Joey>她常吃饼干

<1-3,Rachel>我没喂过她饼干

<1-10,Chandler>但又觉得你可能没兴趣
<1-10,Chandler>We thought you wouldn't be interested.

15
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,060
<1-11,Monica>我们觉得你可能
<1-11,Monica>It's just that we don't think of you

00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:44,940
<1-11,Monica>不擅长跟文字打交道
<1-11,Monica>as really being so much with the words.

00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:08,970
<5-6,Announcer>有人要问一个很特别的问题
<5-6,Announcer>Someone has a special question to ask.

176
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:17,950
<5-7,Phoebe>老套  俗气  丢人现眼
<5-7,Phoebe>How lame. It's so tacky and impersonal.

177
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,100
<5-8,Mike>是吗
<5-8,Mike>Really?

178
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:21,190
<5-9,Phoebe>求婚最烂的招数
<5-9,Phoebe>It's the worst way to propose.

<6-1,Joey>And I think you'll be very, very happy.

182
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:37,720
<6-1,Joey>从来没这么久盯着电脑
<6-1,Joey>It's the longest I ever spent on a computer

183
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:39,040
<6-1,Joey>居然没去看色情站的
<6-1,Joey>without looking at porn.

184
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:43,890
<6-2,Chandler>看不懂
<6-2,Chandler>I don't understand.

185
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:47,720
<6-3,Joey>有些词汇对于你来说太深奥了
<6-3,Joey>Some of the words a little too sophisticated for you?

186
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,030
<6-4,Monica>都讲不通啊
<6-4,Monica>It doesn't make any sense.

187
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:52,320
<6-5,Joey>怎么可能
<6-5,Joey>Well, of course it does.

188
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:55,000
<6-5,Joey>我写得很有学问的  我用的"辞典"
<6-5,Joey>It's smart. I used a thesaurus.

189
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,140
<6-6,Chandler>每个词都用
<6-6,Chandler>On every word?

190
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,030
<6-7,Joey>没错
<6-7,Joey>Yep.

191
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:05,240
<6-8,Monica>这句话原本是啥意思
<6-8,Monica>All right, what was this sentence originally?

192
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:09,280
<6-9,Joey>他们是慷慨热心的好人
<6-9,Joey>"They are warm, nice people with big hearts."

193
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:10,370
<6-10,Chandler>结果变成
<6-10,Chandler>And that became,

194
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:14,640
<6-10,Chandler>他们是潮湿的  给人好感的智人
<6-10,Chandler>"They are humid, prepossessing Homo sapiens...

195
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:17,540
<6-10,Chandler>具有超额尺寸的心脏大动脉
<6-10,Chandler>...with full-sized aortic pumps."

196
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,950
<6-11,Joey>是的  我真心这么想
<6-11,Joey>Yeah. Yeah. And hey, I really mean it, dude.

197
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,190
<6-12,Monica>乔伊  恐怕我们不能用这封信
<6-12,Monica>All right, Joey, I don't think we can use this.

198
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,740
<6-13,Joey>-为什么  -因为你的签名是
<6-13,Joey>- Why not? - Well, because you signed it:

200
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:32,070
<6-14,Monica>袋鼠宝宝  小崔
<6-14,Monica>"Baby Kangaroo Tribbiani."

201
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,720
<6-14,Monica>算了  你还是不要假装有学问
<6-14,Monica>Why don't you stop worrying about sounding smart

202
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:41,100
<6-14,Monica>就用你的本色来写怎么样
<6-14,Monica>and just be yourself.

203
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:43,950
<6-15,Chandler>你不必用"辞典"   要用这里写
<6-15,Chandler>You don't need a thesaurus. Just write from here.

204
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,730
<6-15,Chandler>让它发自你超额尺寸的心脏大动脉
<6-15,Chandler>Your full-sized aortic pump.

205
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:53,560
<7-2,Amy>-艾米  嗨  -我听了你的话
<7-2,Amy>- Amy. Hi. - I took your advice.

<7-2,Amy>-我跟米伦分手了  -太好了
<7-2,Amy>- I left Myron. - Good for you!

208
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:59,640
<7-4,Amy>是啊  我简直是艾琳·布洛科维奇
<7-4,Amy>I know. I'm Erin Brockovich.

209
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,190
<7-5,Rachel>对

<7-5,Rachel>- I'm so proud of you. - Thank you.

211
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,360
<7-6,Amy>我能住你这里吗
<7-6,Amy>So can I stay with you?

212
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:16,100
<7-7,Rachel>艾琳·布洛科维奇不是住她自己家吗
<7-7,Rachel>But Erin Brockovich had her own house.

213
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,360
<7-8,Joey>看谁又来啦
<7-8,Joey>Look who's back.

<8-2,Rachel>她梦中总踢我
<8-2,Rachel>Amy kept kicking me in her sleep,

221
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:45,120
<8-2,Rachel>还嚷嚷  米伦  滚出去
<8-2,Rachel>yelling, "Myron, get off!"

222
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:48,660
<8-3,Joey>我们会把她赶走对吧
<8-3,Joey>But we're getting rid of her, right?

223
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,340
<8-3,Joey>瑞秋  答应我  赶走她
<8-3,Joey>Rachel,please tell me we're getting rid of her?

<8-4,Rachel>-我下不了手  乔伊  -噢  不会吧
<8-4,Rachel>- Joey, I can't do that. - Oh, come on.

225
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:55,100
<8-5,Joey>昨晚我正在干光一个披萨
<8-5,Joey>Last night I was finishing off a pizza,

226
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,210
<8-5,Joey>她就说
<8-5,Joey>and she said

227
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,310
<8-5,Joey>嘴巴爽一秒  屁股胖一生
<8-5,Joey>"A moment on the lips, forever on the hips."

228
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:02,050
<8-5,Joey>在我家不需要这种屁话
<8-5,Joey>I don't need that kind of talk in my house!

229
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:05,400
<8-6,Rachel>乔伊  我知道她难相处
<8-6,Rachel>Joey, look, I know that she's difficult...

230
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:08,100
<8-6,Rachel>但她来这里也不错
<8-6,Rachel>...but I think it's really good that she's here.

231
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:12,110
<8-7,Joey>这样她滚蛋后我们才能更欢喜
<8-7,Joey>Because we'll appreciate it more when she's gone?

232
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:16,410
<8-8,Rachel>不  只是  我刚来这城市的时候
<8-8,Rachel>No, it's just-- Look, when I first moved to this city,

233
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,910
<8-8,Rachel>还不是一样
<8-8,Rachel>I was a lot like her.

234
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,430
<8-8,Rachel>被惯坏  自我中心
<8-8,Rachel>I was spoiled, self-centered.

235
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,600
<8-8,Rachel>你们几个却照顾我
<8-8,Rachel>And you guys really took care of me.

236
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,440
<8-9,Joey>莫妮卡强迫我们来着

238
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:31,630
<8-10,Rachel>如果没有你们
<8-10,Rachel>...because I don't think I would be the person I am today...

239
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,420
<8-10,Rachel>也就没有现在的我
<8-10,Rachel>...if it wasn't for you guys.

240
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:35,240
<8-10,Rachel>我想帮帮艾米

<8-10,Rachel>我可以

<8-14,Amy>宝贝  你总不能给我扒下来

253
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,740
<8-16,Amy>这样的眉毛像哭丧着脸

<9-1,Phoebe>最烂的周年庆
<9-1,Phoebe>I just had the worst anniversary ever.

258
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:27,840
<9-2,Chandler>才不是呢
<9-2,Chandler>I doubt that.

259
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,120
<9-2,Chandler>给她讲讲我们去年怎么过的周年
<9-2,Chandler>Tell her about us last year.

260
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:32,180
<9-3,Monica>我给钱德勒买了一只500块的表
<9-3,Monica>Well, I bought Chandler a $500 watch,

261
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:34,380
<9-3,Monica>而他  给我写了首饶舌歌
<9-3,Monica>and he wrote me a rap song.

262
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:39,010
<9-4,Ross>-真的  -用的办公软件
<9-4,Ross>- Seriously? - Word.

263
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,880
<9-6,Phoebe>我的比你还逊
<9-6,Phoebe>Mine was worse than that.

264
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:44,190
<9-7,Rachel>怎么啦
<9-7,Rachel>Well, what happened?

265
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,270
<9-8,Phoebe>球赛时
<9-8,Phoebe>We were at the game.

266
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,220
<9-8,Phoebe>有人在大屏幕上求婚
<9-8,Phoebe>This guy proposed to his girlfriend on the big screen thing.

267
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,440
<9-9,Rachel>老套
<9-9,Rachel>That is so tacky.

268
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:51,230
<9-9,Rachel>我也是那么说
<9-9,Rachel>Well, that's what I said.

269
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,510
<9-10,Phoebe>结果呢  原来迈克昨晚上就想用
<9-10,Phoebe>But it turns out Mike was planning on

270
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,730
<9-10,Phoebe>这种方式向我求婚
<9-10,Phoebe>proposing to me the same way last night.

271
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:58,060
<9-11,Monica>天  迈克要求婚
<9-11,Monica>Oh, my God. Mike was gonna propose?

272
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:59,030
<9-12,Rachel>大件事
<9-12,Rachel>That's huge.

273
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,190
<9-13,Ross>你想嫁他吗
<9-13,Ross>Do you want to marry him?

274
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,370
<9-14,Phoebe>当然想啦
<9-14,Phoebe>Yeah, I really do. Yes.

275
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:05,610
<9-14,Phoebe>结果我那句话把他堵回去了
<9-14,Phoebe>But after I dumped on the way he was gonna do it...

276
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,290
<9-14,Phoebe>我想他一辈子都不会求婚了
<9-14,Phoebe>...l don't think he'll ever ask again.

277
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:09,730
<9-14,Phoebe>在巴贝多斯我拒绝过他一次了  现在又一次
<9-14,Phoebe>I said no in Barbados, and now this?

278
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,990
<9-15,Chandler>没错  如果我是男人
<9-15,Chandler>She's right. If I were a guy and....

279
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:20,190
<9-15,Chandler>我刚才是不是说  如果我是男人
<9-15,Chandler>Did I just say, "lf I were a guy"?

280
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:23,430
<9-16,Monica>别等他求婚了
<9-16,Monica>You don't need him to propose to you.

281
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,850
<9-16,Monica>主动出击吧
<9-16,Monica>Maybe you could propose to him.

282
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:27,090
<9-17,Phoebe>哦  不知道
<9-17,Phoebe>Oh, I don't know.

283
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:28,970
<9-17,Phoebe>我又不是想嫁想疯了
<9-17,Phoebe>I don't know. Isn't that a little desperate?

284
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,640
<9-18,Monica>我向钱德勒求的婚
<9-18,Monica>I proposed to Chandler.

285
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,480
<9-18,Monica>好吧  继续讲
<9-18,Monica>All right, moving on.

286
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:38,710
<9-19,Chandler>我不觉得你想嫁想疯了
<9-19,Chandler>I don't think it was desperate.

287
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,840
<9-19,Chandler>我觉得你很棒
<9-19,Chandler>It was amazing.

288
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:40,760
<9-20,Monica>谢谢
<9-20,Monica>Thank you.

289
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,090
<9-21,Phoebe>你们都认为我该求婚
<9-21,Phoebe>Well, do you think I should propose?

290
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,340
<9-22,Rachel>那一定很棒
<9-22,Rachel>I think it could be kind of great.

291
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:46,230
<9-22,Rachel>当然
<9-22,Rachel>Absolutely.

292
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,590
<9-23,Ross>世上再没有比求婚
<9-23,Ross>You'll love the feeling.

293
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,740
<9-23,Ross>更美妙的感觉了
<9-23,Ross>There's nothing like it.

294
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:54,790
<9-24,Phoebe>好  那么以何种方式呢
<9-24,Phoebe>Okay. Okay. So how should I do it?

295
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,010
<9-25,Monica>就在球赛的大屏幕上啊
<9-25,Monica>How about at a game on the big screen?

296
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:59,990
<9-26,Rachel>那去体育用品专卖店吧
<9-26,Rachel>How about at a Foot Locker?

297
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:03,950
<9-27,Monica>他既然选择过大屏幕求婚
<9-27,Monica>What? What, he obviously thinks

298
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,190
<9-27,Monica>可见他能接受这种方式
<9-27,Monica>that's a nice way to be proposed to.

299
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,090
<9-27,Monica>而且他也不会起疑心
<9-27,Monica>Plus, he'd never suspect it.

300
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,520
<9-28,Phoebe>有理
<9-28,Phoebe>Yeah, that does make sense.

301
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:12,310
<9-28,Phoebe>你们会喜欢吗
<9-28,Phoebe>Okay, now, would you two like that?

302
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,410
<9-29,Chandler>我喜欢
<9-29,Chandler>Sounds good to me.

303
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,800
<9-29,Chandler>不过男性会怎么想
<9-29,Chandler>But what would a guy think?

304
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:21,160
<9-30,Amy>-奶奶电话  -哇

<9-46,Rachel>Why not?

329
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,530
<9-47,Ross>首先  她老是把我们的孩子喊成"艾拉"
<9-47,Ross>For one thing, she keeps calling her Ella.

<9-52,Rachel>我只是想改造她

00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,350
<9-52,Rachel>这是个好机会
<9-52,Rachel>This is a huge breakthrough for her.

336

<9-52,Rachel>她刚刚主动要求
<9-52,Rachel>She just offered to do something

337

<9-54,Rachel>她宁愿牺牲修眉的时间看孩子
<9-54,Rachel>...she's giving up getting her eyebrows shaped to do this, all right?

341
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:47,680
<9-54,Rachel>你知道这件事
<9-54,Rachel>Do you understand

342
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,040
<9-54,Rachel>对我们女人来说牺牲多重大吗
<9-54,Rachel>how important that is in our world?

343

<9-55,Amy>我不小心听到你们的谈话
