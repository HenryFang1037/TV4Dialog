<1-25,Rachel>我是唯一不觉得她性感的吗  罗斯
<1-25,Rachel>Am I the only one that doesn't think she's hot? Ross?

27
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:21,710
<1-26,Ross>我觉得  她不是没有魅力  但是
<1-26,Ross>I mean,she's not unattractive,but..

28
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:23,140
<1-26,Ross>但是性感嘛

30
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,880
<1-28,Chandler>瑞秋走了  说吧
<1-28,Chandler>Now that Rachel's gone?

31
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,680
<1-29,Rachel>她真性感  我昨晚是哭着入睡的
<1-29,Rachel>So hot,I cried myself to sleep last night.

47
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,250
<2-1,Phoebe>嘿  麦克  秘鲁的首都是哪里
<2-1,Phoebe>Hey,Mike,what's the capital of Peru?

48
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:31,050
<2-2,Mike>-利马  -不是
<2-2,Mike>- Lima. - No.

49
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,030
<2-3,Phoebe>是V开头X结尾的字
<2-3,Phoebe>It starts with a V and ends with an X.

50
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,070
<2-3,Phoebe>然后最好中间有T和O
<2-3,Phoebe>And hopefully with a T-O in the middle.

51
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:41,980
<2-4,Mike>我仔细想想之后
<2-4,Mike>You know,come to think of it,

52
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,970
<2-4,Mike>秘鲁的首都应该叫"VTOX"
<2-4,Mike>the capital of Peru is "Vtox."

53
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,680
<2-4,Mike>-哦  天啊 -怎么了
<2-4,Mike>- Oh,God! - What?

54
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,730
<2-6,Mike>好了  我不想要吓坏你
<2-6,Mike>Okay. I don't want to freak you out or anything..

55
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:52,570
<2-6,Mike>但是我刚在柜子里看到一只老鼠
<2-6,Mike>but I just saw a rat in your cupboard.

56
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:54,850
<2-6,Mike>哦  是哦  那是鲍伯
<2-6,Mike>Oh,yeah. No,that's Bob.

57
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:58,890
<2-7,Mike>是你的宠物鼠吗
<2-7,Mike>Well,he's your pet rat?

58
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:01,950
<2-8,Phoebe>不太算是  只是偶尔会来拜访
<2-8,Phoebe>Well,not so much a pet as,you know,an occasional visitor..

59
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:05,850
<2-8,Phoebe>我有时候会喂他  有点像圣诞老人
<2-8,Phoebe>who I put food out for. Kind of like Santa.

60
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:11,430
<2-8,Phoebe>不过圣诞老人不会在饼干盘里便便
<2-8,Phoebe>Except Santa doesn't poop on the plate of cookies.

61
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,750
<2-9,Mike>你不能在公寓里养老鼠
<2-9,Mike>You can't keep a rat in your apartment.

62
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,410
<2-9,Mike>那很不卫生的
<2-9,Mike>They're extremely unsanitary.

63
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:18,020
<2-9,Mike>它们会传染细螺旋体病或是汉滩病毒
<2-9,Mike>I mean,they transmit leptospirosis and hantavirus.

64
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,860
<2-10,Phoebe>-那是什么  -我不知道
<2-10,Phoebe>What are those? - I don't know..

65
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,340
<2-11,Mike>但听起来可不像是温泉疗养
<2-11,Mike>but they don't sound like spa treatments.

66
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:25,310
<2-11,Mike>-你必须处理掉他  -好啦
<2-11,Mike>- You have to get rid of it. - Okay,fine.

67
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:27,740
<2-12,Phoebe>如果你这么在乎  我会处理掉鲍伯的
<2-12,Phoebe>If it means that much to you,I'll get rid of Bob.

68
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,280
<2-13,Mike>谢谢你
<2-13,Mike>Thank you.

69
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:31,780
<2-14,Phoebe>真奇怪  你觉得他很恶心
<2-14,Phoebe>It's so weird you think he's so gross,

70
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,620
<2-14,Phoebe>却又在吃他的饼干
<2-14,Phoebe>yet you're willing to eat his crackers.

71
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,530
<3-2,Gavin>加文  我想再次跟你道谢
<3-2,Gavin>Gavin,I just want to say thank you again..

74
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:52,390
<3-4,Gavin>道什么歉
<3-4,Gavin>For what?

75
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:54,510
<3-5,Rachel>当我们第一次见面时  你知道的
<3-5,Rachel>When we first met,you know..

76
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:57,940
<3-5,Rachel>我以为你是自负  高傲又讨人厌的人
<3-5,Rachel>I thought you were pompous and arrogant and obnoxious.

77
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,340
<3-6,Gavin>你待会儿又得接着道歉吧
<3-6,Gavin>Is this your first apology?

78
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:02,160
<3-7,Rachel>不  我只是想说
<3-7,Rachel>No,I just mean,you know,

79
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,210
<3-7,Rachel>第一印象通常不是很重要的
<3-7,Rachel>first impressions don't mean anything.

80
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,900
<3-7,Rachel>而我认为你是个好男人
<3-7,Rachel>And I think you're a really good guy.

<3-9,Rachel>我很抱歉  显然
<3-9,Rachel>I'm sorry. Obviously,

86
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:23,420
<3-9,Rachel>海瑟的屁股有更重要的事要对你说
<3-9,Rachel>Heather's ass has something more important to say..

87
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,840
<3-9,Rachel>我先让它说完好了
<3-9,Rachel>so I'll just wait till it's finished.

<3-11,Rachel>-什么  -我正在跟你道歉
<3-11,Rachel>- What? - I was giving you an apology..

89
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,770
<3-11,Rachel>而你一直在打量她
<3-11,Rachel>and you were totally checking her out.

90
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,720
<3-12,Gavin>我没有  我在时装业工作
<3-12,Gavin>I wasn't. I'm in fashion.

91
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,610
<3-12,Gavin>我只是在看她的裙子
<3-12,Gavin>I was looking at her skirt.

92
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:37,010
<3-12,Gavin>貌似是裤子吧  我并没有看清楚
<3-12,Gavin>Or was it pants? I didn't really see

93
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,030
<3-12,Gavin>屁股以下的部位
<3-12,Gavin>what happened below the ass area.

<3-13,Rachel>哇  你真的是  你真恶心
<3-13,Rachel>Wow,you are really.. You're really a creep.

00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:45,510
<3-14,Gavin>就算我是在看她  你又在乎什么呢
<3-14,Gavin>What do you care if I was looking at her?

96
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,660
<3-14,Gavin>你是在忌妒吗

99
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,100
<3-15,Rachel>不要看我的屁股
<3-15,Rachel>Stop looking at my ass!

100
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:59,360
<3-15,Rachel>我只是认为这样的行为是不妥的
<3-15,Rachel>I mean,I just think you are totally inappropriate. Okay?

101
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,310
<3-15,Rachel>这是工作场所  她是你下属
<3-15,Rachel>This is a work environment. She's your subordinate.

102
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:06,010
<3-16,Gavin>但你跟你前助理泰格上床就可以吗
<3-16,Gavin>But it was okay when you slept with your old assistant,Tag?

103
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,420
<3-17,Rachel>那完全不一样  原因有二
<3-17,Rachel>That is totally different for two reasons.

104
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:13,060
<3-17,Rachel>一  我不知道你知道那件事
<3-17,Rachel>One: I didn't know that you knew that.

105
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,690
<3-17,Rachel>二  我不是盯着他屁股看的恶心人
<3-17,Rachel>And two: I wasn't some creep staring at his ass.

106
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:22,620
<3-17,Rachel>我们有很深入  有意义的交往
<3-17,Rachel>We had a.. We had a deep,meaningful relationship.

111
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:41,250
<3-19,Rachel>就叫泰格而已  就像雪儿  或是
<3-19,Rachel>It was just Tag,you know,like Cher or..

112
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:44,090
<3-19,Rachel>摩西

<4-2,Molly>你是说你小时候吗
<4-2,Molly>You mean when you were a baby?

122
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:10,380

<4-3,Joey>Sure.

123
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,950
<4-4,Monica>你可不可以别再盯着她看
<4-4,Monica>Would you stop staring at her?

124
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:17,280
<4-5,Chandler>我没有盯着
<4-5,Chandler>I wasn't staring.

125
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,890
<4-5,Chandler>我是斜眼瞄着
<4-5,Chandler>I was leering.

126
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,290
<4-6,Monica>她有什么了不起的呢
<4-6,Monica>What's the big deal with her?

127
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,550
<4-6,Monica>或许她有很抢眼的魅力
<4-6,Monica>Maybe she's attractive in an obvious kind of way.

128
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,060
<4-7,Ross>是啊  抢眼的魅力最糟糕了
<4-7,Ross>Yeah,obvious beauty's the worst.

129
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:31,830
<4-7,Ross>你知道的  当它就显现在你面前时
<4-7,Ross>You know,when it's right there in your face.

130

<4-7,Ross>我比较喜欢渐渐去发掘一个人的魅力
<4-7,Ross>Me,I like to have to work to find someone attractive.

00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,110
<4-7,Ross>让我感觉像是我辛苦得来的
<4-7,Ross>Makes me feel like I earned it.

<4-8,Chandler>看起来乔伊好像跟她处的不错
<4-8,Chandler>Looks like Joey's doing all right with her.

00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:01,330
<4-12,Monica>你模仿婴儿说话的事

142
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,870
<4-12,Monica>大家不是很喜欢
<4-12,Monica>It's not so good.

143

<4-13,Molly>我觉得挺可爱的
<4-13,Molly>I think it's sweet.

<4-14,Joey>Hey,listen,Joey. About Molly,

146
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:15,470
<4-14,Joey>我希望你不要去动她
<4-14,Joey>I would really prefer if you didn't go after her.

147
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,600
<4-14,Joey>为什么不行
<4-14,Joey>Why not?

148
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,340
<4-15,Rachel>因为我们花了好几个月才找到好保姆
<4-15,Rachel>It took months to find a good nanny.

149
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:23,180
<4-15,Rachel>而我不希望有任何事情让她离开
<4-15,Rachel>And I wouldn't want anything to,you know,drive her away.

150
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,640
<4-16,Joey>所以你认为我只会跟她上床
<4-16,Joey>So you think I'm just gonna sleep with her..

151
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,930
<4-16,Joey>之后就不再打电话给她
<4-16,Joey>and never call her again,

152
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:28,770
<4-16,Joey>让一切都变得很尴尬吗
<4-16,Joey>and things are gonna get uncomfortable?

153
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:30,750
<4-16,Joey>是啊  听起来好像也对
<4-16,Joey>Yeah,that sounds about right.

154
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:34,430
<4-17,Ross>别这样  外面到处都是女人
<4-17,Ross>Come on,there are plenty of other women out there.

155
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:39,070
<4-17,Ross>别打她的主意  不可以碰她
<4-17,Ross>Just forget about her,okay? She's off-limits.

156
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,400
<4-18,Joey>天啊  你为什么要这样说呢
<4-18,Joey>Oh,man! What'd you have to go and say that for?

157
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:44,560
<4-18,Joey>你越说我不可以碰她
<4-18,Joey>Now that you told me I can't have her,

158
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,310
<4-18,Joey>我就越想要她了
<4-18,Joey>makes me want her even more!

159
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,540
<4-19,Ross>-你还是小孩啊  -是的
<4-19,Ross>- What are you,a child? - Yes!

160
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,020
<4-20,Joey>听着  乔伊  别这样  为了我  拜托
<4-20,Joey>Look,Joey,come on now. For me,please.

161
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:57,880
<4-21,Ross>把你的性能量转移到别人身上
<4-21,Ross>Just try to focus your sexual energy on someone else.

162
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,000
<4-22,Joey>好啦

<5-3,Phoebe>- What are you doing? - Setting rattraps.

166
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:20,430
<5-5,Phoebe>要杀鲍伯吗
<5-5,Phoebe>To kill Bob?

167
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:23,610
<5-6,Mike>不是  只是测试一下他脖子有多硬
<5-6,Mike>No. No,to test his neck strength.

168
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:26,180
<5-7,Phoebe>不  我不想杀死他
<5-7,Phoebe>No,I don't want to kill him.

169
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,950
<5-7,Phoebe>我以为我们要活抓他
<5-7,Phoebe>I thought we were gonna capture him..

170
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:30,500
<5-7,Phoebe>然后到乡下把他放生
<5-7,Phoebe>and,you know,set him free in the countryside..

171
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,760
<5-7,Phoebe>让他可以认识友善的负鼠
<5-7,Phoebe>where he could meet a friendly possum..

172
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,610
<5-7,Phoebe>或是爱说笑的猫头鹰
<5-7,Phoebe>and a wisecracking owl.

173
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:37,530
<5-8,Mike>好了  我把捕鼠器丢掉
<5-8,Mike>Okay,okay. I'll throw away the traps.

174
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:39,460
<5-9,Phoebe>好  我会找到鲍伯  我会抓到他的
<5-9,Phoebe>All right,I'll find Bob. I'll get him.

175

<5-9,Phoebe>鲍伯  鲍伯

177
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:50,030
<5-9,Phoebe>等等  我听到他的声音了
<5-9,Phoebe>Wait,I think I hear him.

178
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:56,290
<5-9,Phoebe>天啊  鲍伯生小孩了 鲍伯当妈妈了
<5-9,Phoebe>Oh,my God! Bob had babies! Bob's a mom!

179

<5-10,Mike>我们得替她改名字了
<5-10,Mike>We'll have to think of a new name.

180
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:01,060
<5-11,Phoebe>我不知道  我喜欢"鲍伯"当女生名字
<5-11,Phoebe>I don't know,I kind of like "Bob" for a girl.

181
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,800
<5-12,Mike>不不  我是说我不确定我们
<5-12,Mike>No,no. I mean,I'm not sure that we..

<5-13,Phoebe>天啊  我们杀了鲍伯吗
<5-13,Phoebe>Oh,my God. We killed Bob?

183
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:13,060
<5-14,Mike>或许不是鲍伯  或许只是只老鼠
<5-14,Mike>Well,maybe it wasn't Bob. Maybe it was a mouse.

184
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,390
<5-14,Mike>苏西
<5-14,Mike>Susie?

00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:33,680
<6-2,Ross>确保他跟莫莉之间不会出事吗
<6-2,Ross>make sure nothing happens between him and Molly?

<6-3,Chandler>-你不相信他吗  -不相信
<6-3,Chandler>- You don't trust him? - Well,no.

192
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:39,110
<6-4,Ross>有个听起来很像乔伊声音的女人
<6-4,Ross>Some woman who sounded a lot like Joey

193
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:39,760
<6-4,Ross>之前打电话来
<6-4,Ross>called earlier..

194
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,120
<6-4,Ross>要找她称之为"性感保姆"的女儿
<6-4,Ross>and asked for her daughter,the "hot nanny."

195
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:47,070
<6-5,Chandler>你打算让我长期干预他们吗
<6-5,Chandler>Is this your long-term plan,for me to run interference?

196
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:50,210
<6-5,Chandler>我可能随时都会找到工作的
<6-5,Chandler>Because I could get a job any day now.

197
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:54,160
<6-6,Ross>你在某些方面真是拔尖人才
<6-6,Ross>You do appear right on the cusp of something.

198
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,690
<6-6,Ross>听着  拜托  老兄
<6-6,Ross>Look,come on,man.

199
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:57,760
<6-6,Ross>我确定他一两星期后就会没兴趣了
<6-6,Ross>I'm sure he'll lose interest in a week or two..

200
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:00,590
<6-6,Ross>但是目前  你可以帮我这个忙吗

<6-7,Chandler>好啦  但是如果失败可别怪我哦

202
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:05,720
<6-7,Chandler>因为你也了解  乔伊一旦下定决心
<6-7,Chandler>Because you know once Joey sets his mind on something..

203
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,970
<6-7,Chandler>无论如何  他都会把她搞上手的
<6-7,Chandler>more often than not,he's going to have sex with it.

204
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,530
<6-8,Ross>那我们得要做点什么  不是吗
<6-8,Ross>Well,I mean,we've gotta do something. Okay?

205
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:16,290
<6-8,Ross>她那样的保姆可不是树上凭空长出来的
<6-8,Ross>Nannies like her don't grow on trees.

206
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,460
<6-9,Chandler>-在想像那棵树吗  -是的  没错
<6-9,Chandler>- Picturing that tree? - I am,yes.

207
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:30,520
<7-1,Chandler>你要去哪  乔
<7-1,Chandler>Where you going,Joe?

208

210
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:42,270
<7-4,Joey>事实上  我想要一个人去
<7-4,Joey>Actually,I'd rather be alone.

211
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:45,110
<7-4,Joey>我真的需要理清一些想法
<7-4,Joey>You know,I really need to organize my thoughts.

212
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:48,620
<7-5,Chandler>一"些"想法
<7-5,Chandler>Your thoughts?

213
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,620
<7-5,Chandler>复数的
<7-5,Chandler>Plural?

214
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:55,320
<7-6,Joey>好啦  我只有一个想法
<7-6,Joey>All right,fine. I only have one thought.

215
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:58,160
<7-6,Joey>就是关于那个性感保姆  我必须见到她
<7-6,Joey>It's about the hot nanny! I gotta see her!

216
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:01,700
<7-7,Chandler>恐怕我不能让你去  乔伊
<7-7,Chandler>I'm afraid I can't let you do that,Joe.

217
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,350
<7-8,Joey>你是说我不能见她
<7-8,Joey>Now you're saying I can't see her?

218
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:04,500
<7-8,Joey>你简直让我生不如死
<7-8,Joey>You're killing me!

219
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,370
<7-8,Joey>她就像是禁果  就像是...
<7-8,Joey>She's forbidden fruit! It's like,like..

220
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:11,340
<7-8,Joey>她是公主  而我是马童
<7-8,Joey>like she's the princess and I'm the stable boy.

221
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,800
<7-8,Joey>为什么你要这样
<7-8,Joey>Why are you doing this,huh?

222
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:17,190
<7-8,Joey>是不是罗斯要你别让我过去的呢
<7-8,Joey>Did Ross tell you not to let me go over there?

223
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,040
<7-9,Chandler>没错  事实上的确如此
<7-9,Chandler>Yes,as a matter of fact,he did.

224
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,530
<7-9,Chandler>所以我不能让你过去
<7-9,Chandler>So I can't let you go.

225
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:24,840
<7-10,Joey>有趣  现在出现挡路的了

263
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,680
<8-17,Rachel>为什么你要邀请他
<8-17,Rachel>Why did you invite him?

264
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,050
<8-17,Rachel>我无法忍受那个男的
<8-17,Rachel>I can't stand that guy!

265
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,760
<8-18,Monica>你看起来跟他很好啊
<8-18,Monica>You were being so nice to him.

266
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,390
<8-19,Rachel>我是装出来的
<8-19,Rachel>I was faking it.

267
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:17,090
<8-19,Rachel>你难道看不出来我是装的吗
<8-19,Rachel>Can't you tell when I'm being fake?

268
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,910
<8-20,Rachel>嘿  菲利浦先生  西装真帅
<8-20,Rachel>Hey,Mr. Phillips. Nice suit.

269
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,870
<8-21,Monica>抓到了  装出来的恭维话
<8-21,Monica>Right there. That was so fake!

270
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,990
<8-21,Monica>我真不敢相信  你邀请了加文
<8-21,Monica>I still can't believe you invited Gavin.

271
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,030
<8-21,Monica>他是我最不想见到的人
<8-21,Monica>He is just the last person I want to see.

272
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:41,520
<9-1,Monica>"不用谢我帮你办派对"
<9-1,Monica>You're welcome for the party.

00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:45,610
<9-2,Rachel>我希望他不要出现
<9-2,Rachel>I hope he doesn't show up.

275
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:47,630
<9-2,Rachel>他当然不会  他讨厌我
<9-2,Rachel>Of course he won't,the guy hates me.

276
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:49,830
<9-3,Monica>-是吗  -什么
<9-3,Monica>- Does he? - What?

277
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:53,340
<9-5,Monica>或许他一直惹你生气  是因为喜欢你
<9-5,Monica>Maybe he keeps bothering you so much because he likes you.

278
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:54,960
<9-5,Monica>就像在小学一年级的时候
<9-5,Monica>It's like in first grade

279
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,000
<9-5,Monica>斯库普·郎把我推倒在操场上
<9-5,Monica>when Skippy Lange would always push me on the playground

280
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,850
<9-5,Monica>其实是因为他在暗恋我
<9-5,Monica>because he secretly had a crush on me.

281
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:02,250
<9-6,Rachel>莫妮卡  你以为斯库普喜欢你吗
<9-6,Rachel>Monica,you think Skippy liked you?

282
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,170
<9-6,Rachel>亲爱的  所有的男生都在打赌
<9-6,Rachel>Honey,all those boys had a bet

283
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:06,000
<9-6,Rachel>看他是不是有办法撂倒你
<9-6,Rachel>to see if he could knock you over.

284
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,710
<9-6,Rachel>她睡了  我带她回去
<9-6,Rachel>She's out. I'm gonna take her home.

<9-7,Rachel>男人都觉得她很有魅力  你有发现吗
<9-7,Rachel>Do you see what all the guys see in her?

288
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:21,500
<9-8,Monica>至少不会想踢她下床
<9-8,Monica>Wouldn't kick her out of bed.

289
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,030
<9-8,Monica>我不可以再喝伏特加了
<9-8,Monica>No more vodka for me.

<9-18,Phoebe>你应该知道的  瑞秋  你自己也是母亲
<9-18,Phoebe>You should know that, Rachel, you're a mother.

306
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:17,200
<9-19,Rachel>你把我女儿跟一只老鼠做比较
<9-19,Rachel>Are you comparing my daughter to a rat?

314
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:31,270
<9-22,Phoebe>不是每个人都请得起保姆的
<9-22,Phoebe>Not everyone can afford help.

315
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:41,260
<9-23,Ross>嘿  乔伊跟莫莉去哪了

00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:56,270
<10-1,Joey>所以你瞧  莫莉  人们不了解
<10-1,Joey>So you see,Molly,what people don't understand..

321
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:58,830
<10-1,Joey>演戏也是一门学科
<10-1,Joey>is that acting is a discipline.

322
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:00,550
<10-1,Joey>需要很辛苦的学习和付出
<10-1,Joey>It takes a lot of hard work.

323
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,790
<10-2,Molly>所以你是在哪里学的

<10-5,Joey>莫莉  演戏不是学来的
<10-5,Joey>Molly,people don't study acting.

330
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,920
<10-9,Ross>你以为你接下来会发生什么
<10-9,Ross>What do you think you were gonna do,

331
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,330
<10-9,Ross>在我家沙发上跟她作爱
<10-9,Ross>have sex with her right here on my couch?

332
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:31,960
<10-10,Joey>不  沙发皮会黏住我的屁股
<10-10,Joey>No. The leather sticks to my ass.

333
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:34,380
<10-10,Joey>真不公平
<10-10,Joey>You know, This isn't fair.

334
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,450
<10-10,Joey>你凭什么认为我会跟她上床
<10-10,Joey>What makes you think I'm gonna sleep with her..

335
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:37,880
<10-10,Joey>然后就抛弃她呢
<10-10,Joey>and then blow her off,huh?

336
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,890
<10-10,Joey>你们难道不能敞开心胸接受
<10-10,Joey>Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility

337
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:42,490
<10-10,Joey>或许我是真的喜欢她
<10-10,Joey>that I actually like her..

338
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:44,360
<10-10,Joey>而且想来段真感情
<10-10,Joey>and might want something real?

<10-10,Joey>听着  事实上
<10-10,Joey>Look,the truth is,

340
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:48,700
<10-10,Joey>自从瑞秋之后
<10-10,Joey>I haven't felt this way

341
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,820
<10-10,Joey>我就没有对任何人有过这种感觉了
<10-10,Joey>about anyone since Rachel.

342
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:54,190
<10-10,Joey>好吗  我以为我不会再爱了

<11-1,Phoebe>然后就送他们上床睡觉
<11-1,Phoebe>And then we gotta put them straight to bed.

354
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:54,900
<11-2,Mike>我们什么时候变成了那种
<11-2,Mike>When did we become one of those couples..

355
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,120
<11-2,Mike>生活围绕着老鼠转的小情侣
<11-2,Mike>whose lives revolve around their rats?

356
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,650
<11-3,Phoebe>因为  他们现在是我们的责任了
<11-3,Phoebe>Well,you know what? They're our responsibility now.

358
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,570
<11-4,Mike>要是他们交配后  变成上百只呢
<11-4,Mike>What happens when they mate and there are hundreds?

00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:10,740
<11-5,Phoebe>交配  他们是兄弟姐妹耶

<11-6,Mike>是啊  但是对老鼠可不是问题
<11-6,Mike>Yeah,not such a problem with rats.

361
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,110
<11-6,Mike>他们是"爱上谁就上谁"的那种
<11-6,Mike>No,they're more of a "love the one you're with" kind of animal.

362
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:19,970
<11-6,Mike>才不  真的吗
<11-6,Mike>No. Really?

<11-7,Phoebe>我的天  我们该怎么办呢
<11-7,Phoebe>Oh,my God. What are we gonna do?

365
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:31,120
<11-7,Phoebe>我们有七只老鼠
<11-7,Phoebe>The.. We have seven rats.

366
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:34,540
<11-7,Phoebe>如果七只老鼠的每一只
<11-7,Phoebe>So,what if each of them has seven rats..

367
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:38,030
<11-7,Phoebe>都再生七只  那就是
<11-7,Phoebe>and then each of those has seven rats? That's like..

368
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:44,260
<11-7,Phoebe>我都算不过来了
<11-7,Phoebe>That's math I can't even do!

369
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:47,240
<11-7,Phoebe>我们该怎么办呢
<11-7,Phoebe>What are we gonna do?

370
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,200
<11-8,Mike>嗯  我知道这听起来很疯狂
<11-8,Mike>Well,I know this is gonna sound crazy..

371
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:54,870
<11-8,Mike>但我们可以不让这盒老鼠
<11-8,Mike>but we could not let the box of rats

372
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:56,320
<11-8,Mike>毁了我们的生活
<11-8,Mike>ruin our lives.

373
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:02,210
<11-9,Phoebe>是啊  好吧  我想你说的对
<11-9,Phoebe>Yeah,okay. I guess you're right.

374
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:05,760
<11-9,Phoebe>好了  我们必须送走他们
<11-9,Phoebe>All right,so we should just give them away.

375
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,890
<11-9,Phoebe>但要送给有小孩的好人家
<11-9,Phoebe>But to nice families with children

376
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:11,860
<11-9,Phoebe>还要有低脂全麦饼干
<11-9,Phoebe>and reduced-fat Wheat Thins.

377
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:14,400
<11-9,Phoebe>那些是鲍伯最喜欢的
<11-9,Phoebe>Those were Bob's favorites.

378
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,500
<11-10,Mike>会没事的
<11-10,Mike>It's gonna be okay.

379
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:19,600
<11-11,Phoebe>你一定认为我疯了
<11-11,Phoebe>You must think I'm crazy.

380
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,570
<11-12,Mike>不  我觉得你很善良
<11-12,Mike>No,I think you're sweet.

381
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:25,550
<11-12,Mike>好吧  真的好难
<11-12,Mike>Good. This is just so hard.

382
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:28,910
<11-13,Phoebe>我心里好难割舍
<11-13,Phoebe>It's hard for me to let them go.

383
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:32,340
<11-13,Phoebe>我猜这让我联想起很多往事
<11-13,Phoebe>I guess it just brings back memories,you know..

384
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:35,600
<11-13,Phoebe>就像我怀了我弟的三胞胎
<11-13,Phoebe>from when I gave birth to my brother's triplets

385
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,790
<11-13,Phoebe>最后却抛弃了他们
<11-13,Phoebe>and I had to give them up.

386
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,200
<11-13,Phoebe>我没有告诉过你那件事吗
<11-13,Phoebe>I haven't told you about that yet,have I?

387

<12-7,Gavin>我们不是在说你  我们
<12-7,Gavin>We weren't talking about you. We were..

396

<12-8,Monica>No. No way to recover. No. Okay.

419
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:52,290
<12-20,Rachel>是因为你对我有感觉
