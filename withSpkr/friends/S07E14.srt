<1-20,Rachel>只有我这样吗  是我反应过度吗
<1-20,Rachel>You guys, is it just me? Am I overreacting?

<4-4,Monica>在30岁生日时什么都不做
<4-4,Monica>Doing nothing on your 30th is

60
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,290
<4-4,Monica>总比做蠢事好  像罗斯一样
<4-4,Monica>better than doing something stupid, like Ross.

61
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:36,360
<4-5,Ross>我买东西很实际的

<4-7,Chandler>Wouldrt it be cheaper to just stuff a sock down there?

67
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,540
<4-8,Ross>不是为了那个
<4-8,Ross>That's not what this is about.

<5-1,Rachel>我要在身上打个洞
<5-1,Rachel>I want to get something pierced.

81
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,580
<5-1,Rachel>像是鼻子  舌头  或是别的地方
<5-1,Rachel>Like my nose or my tongue or something.

82
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:01,510
<5-2,Phoebe>真的  那会很痛的

<5-6,Monica>正视事实吧  没有人能真正好好面对
<5-6,Monica>Let's face it, no one handles this well.

90

<5-14,Chandler>不能相信你有件30岁的燕尾服
<5-14,Chandler>And I can't believe you have a tux that's 30 years old.

100
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,630

<8-9,Chandler>我们成功地穿过了客厅  你做的很好
<8-9,Chandler>We made it across the room. You're doing great.

168
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,290
<8-10,Phoebe>怎么回事
<8-10,Phoebe>What's going on?

169
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:09,090
<8-11,Chandler>莫妮卡有一点醉了
<8-11,Chandler>Monica's a little drunk.

170
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,430
<8-12,Phoebe>我喜欢酒醉的莫妮卡
<8-12,Phoebe>Yeah! I love drunk Monica.

171
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:16,200
<8-13,Monica>她比正常的莫妮卡有趣多了
<8-13,Monica>Oh, she's so much more fun than regular Monica.

172
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,540
<8-14,Chandler>她不想让她的父母知道她醉了
<8-14,Chandler>She doesn't want her parents to know she's drunk.

173
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:25,110
<8-14,Chandler>好  好  我们这么做
<8-14,Chandler>All right, all right. Here's what we'll do.

174
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,300
<8-15,Phoebe>我来比她醉得厉害两倍
<8-15,Phoebe>I'll get twice as drunk,

175
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,280
<8-15,Phoebe>就没有人会注意她了
<8-15,Phoebe>then no one will even notice her.

176
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,300
<8-16,Rachel>怎么了
<8-16,Rachel>What's going on?

177
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,430
<8-17,Chandler>莫妮卡醉了
<8-17,Chandler>Monica's wasted.

178
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,240
<8-18,Ross>或许能让这个宴会有点生机
<8-18,Ross>Maybe that will liven up this party.

179
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,310
<8-19,Chandler>你能不能帮她换衣服
<8-19,Chandler>Will you just help her get changed?

180
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:46,980
<8-20,Rachel>照顾酒醉裸体的女人  好像是乔伊的工作
<8-20,Rachel>Taking care of a drunk, naked woman seems like a job for Joey.

181
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:53,920
<9-1,Tag>这是我的礼物
<9-1,Tag>This one's from me.

188
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,670
<9-9,Joey>你们现在是一对  就只送一件礼物了吗
<9-9,Joey>Now that you're a couple, we don't get two gifts?

189
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:21,010
<9-10,Chandler>我上一个生日  你送我一个拥抱
<9-10,Chandler>For my last birthday, you gave me a hug.

190
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,010
<9-10,Chandler>念卡片  念卡片
<9-10,Chandler>Read the card! Read the card!

191
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,160
<9-10,Chandler>"生日快乐"祖母
<9-10,Chandler>"Happy birthday, Grandma.

192
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:35,160
<9-11,Rachel>开始走下坡总比
<9-11,Rachel>It's better to be over the hill...

193
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:37,960
<9-11,Rachel>被埋在坡下要好
<9-11,Rachel>...than buried under it.

194
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:44,130
<9-11,Rachel>我们爱你  莫妮卡和钱德勒  好好笑
<9-11,Rachel>All our love, Monica and Chandler." That's funny.

195
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,740
<9-12,Chandler>不  不  只是一个玩笑
<9-12,Chandler>No, no. That was a joke.

196
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,740
<9-13,Rachel>我知道  我懂了  很好笑
<9-13,Rachel>I know, I get it. It's funny.

197
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,950
<9-14,Chandler>因为你不是祖母
<9-14,Chandler>Because you're not a grandmother.

198
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:55,680
<9-15,Rachel>做为一个祖母  必须结了婚有小孩
<9-15,Rachel>To be a grandma, you have to be married and have children.

199
00:11:55,890 --> 00:12:00,380
<9-15,Rachel>我全都没有  所以真的很好笑
<9-15,Rachel>I don't have any of those things. That's why it's so funny.

200
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,680
<9-16,Monica>你只需要买张卡片而己
<9-16,Monica>All you had to do was buy the card.

201
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:20,770
<10-2,Rachel>为没有先生和小孩就不高兴  是很蠢的
<10-2,Rachel>It was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids.

202
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:23,030
<10-3,Ross>我只需要一个计划
<10-3,Ross>All I really needed was a plan.

203
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,230
<10-4,Rachel>我想生三个小孩
<10-4,Rachel>See, I want to have three kids.

204
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,380
<10-5,Phoebe>你要全部同一个时候生
<10-5,Phoebe>And you want to have them all at the same time,

205
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,500
<10-5,Phoebe>然后把他们给你弟弟
<10-5,Phoebe>and have them for your brother.

206
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:34,040
<10-6,Rachel>我就是说
<10-6,Rachel>As I was saying...

207
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:37,780
<10-6,Rachel>我应该在35岁以前生第一个
<10-6,Rachel>I should have the first one by the time I'm 35.

208
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:40,140
<10-6,Rachel>这样我还有五年
<10-6,Rachel>Which gives me five years.

209
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,860
<10-8,Rachel>如果我35时要生孩子
<10-8,Rachel>If I want a kid when I'm 35,

210
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,300
<10-8,Rachel>我34岁之前都不用怀孕
<10-8,Rachel>I don't have to get pregnant until I'm 34.

211
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:49,000
<10-8,Rachel>普拉达还有四年时间生产孕妇装
<10-8,Rachel>Which gives Prada four years to start making maternity clothes.

212
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:55,740
<10-8,Rachel>我想在怀孕之前至少结婚一年
<10-8,Rachel>But I want to be married for a year before I get pregnant.

213
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:58,010
<10-9,Monica>真的  要那么久
<10-9,Monica>Really? That long?

214
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:05,820
<10-9,Monica>你爱怎么看都行  你就是要娶我了
<10-9,Monica>Look all you want, it's happening.

215
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,270
<10-10,Rachel>我到33岁再结婚就好
<10-10,Rachel>I don't have to get married until I'm 33.

216
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:12,820
<10-10,Rachel>我还有3年
<10-10,Rachel>That's three years, three whole years.

217
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:14,320
<10-10,Rachel>不过  等一下
<10-10,Rachel>Wait a minute, though.

218
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,160
<10-10,Rachel>我需要一年半来筹备婚礼
<10-10,Rachel>I'll need a year and a half to plan the wedding.

219
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:21,370
<10-10,Rachel>我希望能认识这个人一年至一年半
<10-10,Rachel>And I'd like to know the guy for a year, year and a half...

220
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,800
<10-10,Rachel>再订婚
<10-10,Rachel>...before we get engaged.

221
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:28,970
<10-10,Rachel>这表示我必须在30岁时认识这个人
<10-10,Rachel>Which means I need to meet the guy by the time I'm 30.

222
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:34,300
<10-11,Ross>没有问题  因为你才刚满
<10-11,Ross>Which is fine because you just turned...

224
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,550
<10-12,Rachel>不  罗斯  不  有问题
<10-12,Rachel>No, Ross. No, it is not fine.

225
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:43,310
<10-12,Rachel>我应该和我要嫁的对象在一起了
<10-12,Rachel>I should already be with the guy I'm gonna marry.

226
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,320
<10-13,Joey>你可不可以不要跳
<10-13,Joey>Will you quit hogging it?

227
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:01,410
<11-1,Rachel>我告诉你  这就好像看着小鹿学走路
<11-1,Rachel>I'm telling you, it's like watching Bambi learn how to walk.

228
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:04,310
<11-1,Rachel>你醉了
<11-1,Rachel>You're drunk.

229
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:08,240
<11-2,Ross>爸和妈会生气
<11-2,Ross>Mom and Dad are gonna be mad.

230
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:12,320
<11-3,Chandler>也许我有一点醉了
<11-3,Chandler>Maybe I'm a little drunk.

231
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,320
<11-4,Joey>那是蟹饼吗
<11-4,Joey>Are those crab cakes?

232
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:17,910
<11-4,Joey>我不是告诉你  蟹饼一出来立刻拿来给我
<11-4,Joey>Did I not tell you to come straight to me

233
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:20,290
<11-4,Joey>蟹饼一出来立刻拿来给我
<11-4,Joey>when more crab cakes were ready?

234
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,930
<11-5,Chandler>你感觉怎么样
<11-5,Chandler>How you feeling?

235
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,560
<11-6,Monica>你好帅
<11-6,Monica>You are so handsome.

236
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,840
<11-6,Monica>我想在此时此地和你嘿咻
<11-6,Monica>I want to make love to you right here, right now.

237
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:38,440
<11-7,Ross>我希望你不会
<11-7,Ross>I really wish that you wouldn't.

238
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:44,890
<11-8,Chandler>再撑一下  我们就可以带你去睡觉
<11-8,Chandler>All you have to do is just get through a little bit more, then we can put you in bed.

239
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:49,190
<11-8,Chandler>只要微笑  不要和任何人说话
<11-8,Chandler>Just smile and don't talk to anyone.
