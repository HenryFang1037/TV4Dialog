00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,530
<4-5,Phoebe>我丈夫叫汉尼根
<4-5,Phoebe>...and my husband's name is Hannigan.

175
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,580
<4-5,Phoebe>那么应该是"布菲·汉尼根"
<4-5,Phoebe>So is it supposed to be "Buffay-Hannigan"

176
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:18,760
<4-5,Phoebe>还是"汉尼根·布菲"
<4-5,Phoebe>or "Hannigan-Buffay"?

<5-5,Phoebe>Apparently, you can change it to anything.

187
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,390
<5-5,Phoebe>所以我想"好吧

204
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,860
<5-19,Rachel>我老板在同一家餐厅
<5-19,Rachel>My boss was at the same restaurant

206
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,770
<5-19,Rachel>他听见了一切
<5-19,Rachel>...and he heard everything.

207
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,550
<5-19,Rachel>后来他把我叫到他的办公室
<5-19,Rachel>Later, he calls me into his office

208
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,710
<5-19,Rachel>告诉我他要解雇我

209
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,580
<5-19,Rachel>因为我没有团队精神
<5-19,Rachel>...because I'm not a team player.

210
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,500
<5-19,Rachel>然后我说"等等  我有"
<5-19,Rachel>And I said, "Wait a minute. Yes, I am."

269
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,370
<6-8,Monica>我们叫人来检测过房子
<6-8,Monica>We had an inspection

270
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,420
<6-8,Monica>他们什么都没找到
<6-8,Monica>and they didn't find anything.

271
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:44,670
<6-9,Joey>好吧  我想我毫无原因的
<6-9,Joey>Okay. Then I guess I have dry eyes

272
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,030
<6-9,Joey>眼睛干燥喉咙痛
<6-9,Joey>and a scratchy throat for no reason.

273
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,610
<6-10,Monica>或许是因为
<6-10,Monica>Maybe it's because you hung your head

274
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,180
<6-10,Monica>来的一路上
<6-10,Monica>out the window like a dog...

275
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,970
<6-10,Monica>你都像狗一样把头伸到窗外
<6-10,Monica>...the whole ride here.

276
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:53,920
<6-10,Monica>也许是
<6-10,Monica>Maybe.

00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,870
<6-12,Monica>你开什么玩笑
<6-12,Monica>Are you kidding?

281
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,360
<6-13,Joey>我刚才好像在角落看到只蝙蝠
<6-13,Joey>I think I just saw a bat in the corner.

282
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,890
<6-14,Chandler>当你的头伸在车窗外的时候
<6-14,Chandler>When your head was hanging out the window,

283
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:12,150
<6-14,Chandler>没有撞到信箱吧
<6-14,Chandler>it didn't hit a mailbox, did it?

<6-15,Joey>可以有更好的选择
<6-15,Joey>better than this house, you know?

287
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,130
