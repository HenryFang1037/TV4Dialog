<2-18,Chandler>你在暗恋他  为什么还要雇用他
<2-18,Chandler>You have a crush on him, why would you hire him?

<2-19,Rachel>他应该叫我"工作上的太大"
<2-19,Rachel>...he should call me, his "Work-wife."

57

<2-20,Ross>很快的他就可以叫你

<2-21,Rachel>我不会被开除  因为我不会采取行动
<2-21,Rachel>I'm not gonna get fired, because I'm not gonna act on it.

<2-25,Chandler>兄弟  那太惨了

<6-1,Monica>Chandler, what is the matter with your face?

127
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,530
<6-1,Monica>这张照片应该要表达"盖勒和宾要结婚了"
<6-1,Monica>This picture should say, "Geller and Bing to be married,"...

128
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:35,820
<6-1,Monica>而非"英勇女市民勇救溺水弱智"
<6-1,Monica>...not, "Local woman saves drowning moron."

129
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,230
<6-1,Monica>别笑他  他是我的溺水弱智
<6-1,Monica>Hey, don't laugh at him. He's my drowning moron.

130
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:44,570
<6-3,Monica>对了  就是这样  快拍下来
<6-3,Monica>That's it, that's it! Take it, take it!

131
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,510
<6-3,Monica>我喜欢这一张
<6-3,Monica>I like this one.

132
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,550
<6-3,Monica>好像是在说"我爱你  所以我要杀了你"
<6-3,Monica>It seems to say, "I love you and that's why I have to kill you."

133
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,510
<7-1,Ross>不可能每一张都那么糟啊
<7-1,Ross>Can't all be bad.

134
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:02,920
<7-2,Monica>找那张你装出睡眼惺忪的照片
<7-2,Monica>Find the one where you make your bedroom eyes.

135
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,350
<7-2,Monica>这张
<7-2,Monica>There it is.

136
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:08,000
<7-3,Chandler>这是我睡眼惺忪的样子
<7-3,Chandler>Oh, my God, those are my bedroom eyes?

137
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,960
<7-3,Chandler>你为什么要跟我同床共枕
<7-3,Chandler>Why did you ever sleep with me?

138
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,700
<7-4,Monica>你真的想提这件事情吗
<7-4,Monica>Do you really want to pull at that thread?

139
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,370
<7-5,Phoebe>-我真的玩得很开心  -我也是
<7-5,Phoebe>- I'm really having a good time. - Me too.

140
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,480
<7-6,Hums While He Pees>地铁里那人舔了你的脖子真是让人觉得抱歉
<7-6,Hums While He Pees>Sorry that guy on the subway licked your neck.

141
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,220
<7-7,Phoebe>不  没关系  他是我们的朋友
<7-7,Phoebe>No, that's okay. He's a friend.

142
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,580
<7-8,Hums While He Pees>恕我唐突
<7-8,Hums While He Pees>I don't mean to be presumptuous...

143
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:33,810
<7-8,Hums While He Pees>但我有明天国标舞总决赛的门票
<7-8,Hums While He Pees>...but I have tickets to the ballroom-dancing finals tomorrow.

144
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,720
<7-8,Hums While He Pees>就  我
<7-8,Hums While He Pees>Yeah, I...

145
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:40,190
<7-9,Phoebe>我没看半决赛  所以看决赛可能由点迷茫
<7-9,Phoebe>Well, I missed the semifinals, so I think I would just be lost.

146
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,560
<7-10,Hums While He Pees>我知道那真的很无聊
<7-10,Hums While He Pees>I know that it's really lame,

147
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,360
<7-10,Hums While He Pees>但这些票是我的老板给我...
<7-10,Hums While He Pees>but I got these tickets from my boss...

148
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,230
<7-10,Hums While He Pees>不  我的天啊
<7-10,Hums While He Pees>Oh, no, no, no, my God!

149
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,600
<7-11,Phoebe>好了  别大惊小怪  我去就是
<7-11,Phoebe>Okay, don't freak out. I'll go.

<7-12,Hums While He Pees>It's my ex-wife, Whitney.

151
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:55,010
<7-12,Hums While He Pees>我现在没办法面对她  那个女人疯了
<7-12,Hums While He Pees>I cannot deal with her now. That woman is crazy.

152
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:56,810
<7-13,Phoebe>好吧  我知道  等一下
<7-13,Phoebe>Okay, I know. Hold on.

<7-14,Ross>凯尔的前妻惠特妮就在外面
<7-14,Ross>That's Whitney, Kyle's ex-wife, out there.

155
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:06,920
<7-15,Phoebe>你可以把她诱开让我们脱身吗
<7-15,Phoebe>Do you think you could divert her so we could slip out?

156
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:09,180
<7-16,Ross>什么   不
<7-16,Ross>What? No.

157
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:14,320
<7-17,Phoebe>好吧  但我有两张国标舞总决赛的门票
<7-17,Phoebe>Okay, but I have two tickets to the ballroom-dance finals.

158
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:17,430
<7-18,Ross>还是算了  菲比
<7-18,Ross>I don't think so, Pheebs.

159
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,240
<7-18,Ross>好吧  我愿意
<7-18,Ross>All right, I'll do it.

160
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:26,210
<7-18,Ross>-但那只是因为你是我的朋友  -好吧
<7-18,Ross>- But just because you're a friend. - Okay.

161

<8-6,Ross>对不起  但你最好快点离开  菲比
<8-6,Ross>I'm sorry, but you'd better go, Pheebs.

166
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:55,460
<8-7,Phoebe>我只是要谢谢你帮我们诱开凯尔的前妻
<8-7,Phoebe>I just wanted to thank you, though, for diverting Kyle's ex.

167
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:58,610
<8-8,Ross>别客气  待会再谈
<8-8,Ross>You're welcome. We'll talk about it later.

00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,040
<8-11,Whitney>-去吃早餐吧  -好
<8-11,Whitney>- Are you ready for breakfast? - Yep.

170
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:12,480
<8-13,Phoebe>凯尔的前妻    你应该要诱开她不是跟她约会
<8-13,Phoebe>Kyle's ex-wife? You were supposed to divert her, not date her.

171
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:16,960
<8-14,Ross>你能不能等我一下   我得跟这个女人谈一谈
<8-14,Ross>Can you give me a second while I talk to this woman...

172
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,560
<8-14,Ross>而且  她没有在这里过夜
<8-14,Ross>...who, by the way, did not spend the night?

173
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:23,000
<8-15,Whitney>-没问题  -好吧
<8-15,Whitney>- Sure. - Okay.

174
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:28,770
<8-16,Ross>我的确诱开她了 后来我们玩得很开心
<8-16,Ross>I did divert her, and we ended up having a great time, okay?

175
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:30,570
<8-17,Phoebe>你们一起去看国标舞了
<8-17,Phoebe>Watching ballroom dancing?

176
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:33,840
<8-18,Ross>对  那时我们发现我们都很酷
<8-18,Ross>Yes, that's where we realized we were both super-cool people.

177
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:39,150
<8-19,Phoebe>听着  凯尔告诉我她有些缺点
<8-19,Phoebe>Look, Kyle just told me some really bad stuff about her.

178
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:42,010
<8-20,Ross>-譬如说呢   -譬如说她很无情
<8-20,Ross>- Like what? - Like she's really mean...

179
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:44,350
<8-21,Phoebe>她吹毛求疵
<8-21,Phoebe>...and she's overly critical and...

180
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,640
<8-21,Phoebe>她会不经过你的同意
<8-21,Phoebe>She will paint a room a really

181
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,620
<8-21,Phoebe>把房间漆成很明亮的颜色
<8-21,Phoebe>bright color without even checking with you.

182
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,620
<8-22,Ross>好吧
<8-22,Ross>Okay.

183
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:56,120
<8-23,Phoebe>她还会把性当成武器
<8-23,Phoebe>And she uses sex as a weapon.

184
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:57,770
<8-24,Ross>谢谢你的警告
<8-24,Ross>Thank you for warning me.

185
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:02,870
<8-24,Ross>吃早餐时我会注意油漆跟性武器
<8-24,Ross>At breakfast, I'll be on alert for room painting and sex weapons.

186
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,770
<8-25,Phoebe>-你还是要跟她约会   -对
<8-25,Phoebe>- You're still gonna go out with her? - Yeah.

187
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:09,450
<8-27,Phoebe>你没有听到刚刚我说的话吗
<8-27,Phoebe>Well, didn't you hear what I just said?

188
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,680
<8-28,Ross>菲比  少来了  你的消息来源有问题
<8-28,Ross>Pheebs, come on. I mean, consider the source.

189
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:14,350
<8-28,Ross>她的前夫当然会那么说
<8-28,Ross>Of course her ex-husband's gonna say that.

190
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:16,850
<8-28,Ross>现在  请你离开
<8-28,Ross>Now, if you'll excuse me.

191
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:19,350
<8-29,Phoebe>听我说  她疯了
<8-29,Phoebe>Listen to me, she is crazy!

192
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:23,390
<8-30,Whitney>你的门没有隔音功能
<8-30,Whitney>Your door isn't soundproof.

193
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,460
<8-31,Phoebe>看到了吧   她就是爱挑剔
<8-31,Phoebe>You see? Nothing is good enough for her.

194
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,480
<9-2,Rachel>-早安  -嗨  泰格
<9-2,Rachel>- Morning. - Hi, Tag.

195
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,140
<9-2,Rachel>昨晚你跟乔伊玩得开心吗
<9-2,Rachel>Did you have fun with Joey last night?

196
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,250
<9-3,Tag>我们去看纽约队比赛了
<9-3,Tag>Yeah, we went to the Knicks game.

197
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:41,160
<9-4,Rachel>那真的太棒了
<9-4,Rachel>That's nice.

198
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:45,090
<9-5,Tag>然后我们去酒吧玩  他帮我们泡上好多女人
<9-5,Tag>Then we went to a bar, and he hooked us up with all these women.

199
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:51,360
<9-6,Rachel>女人   你是说老女人
<9-6,Rachel>Women? You mean, like old women?

200
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,900
<9-7,Tag>还好吧  30岁左右
<9-7,Tag>Kind of old, like 30.

201
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:04,010
<9-8,Rachel>我以前没办法在酒吧里跟女人聊天
<9-8,Rachel>I never used to be able to just talk to girls in bars...

202
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,480
<9-9,Tag>但昨晚我就拿到了二十个电话号码
<9-9,Tag>...but I got like 20 phone numbers last night.

203
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:11,950
<9-9,Tag>那真的是太棒了
<9-9,Tag>That's great.

204
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,650
<9-10,Rachel>乔伊真的教会你一些事
<9-10,Rachel>Joey must have really taught you some stuff.

205
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,980
<9-11,Tag>一点吧
<9-11,Tag>A little.

206
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,260
<9-13,Tag>你好吗
<9-13,Tag>How you doing?

207

<10-1,Joey>看吧那个笑容非常灿烂  放轻松  自然
<10-1,Joey>See? That's a great smile. Easy, natural.

208
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,740
<10-1,Joey>现在假装我手上拿了照相机
<10-1,Joey>Now pretend I have a camera.

209
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,240
<10-2,Chandler>-你又变了  -我控制不了
<10-2,Chandler>- You're changing it. - I can't help it.

210
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:41,890
<10-3,Joey>你想知道  我都是怎么简历照片的吗
<10-3,Joey>You want to know what I do when I take resume shots?

211
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,060
<10-4,Chandler>跟我借钱拍
<10-4,Chandler>Borrow money from me?

212
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:49,960
<10-5,Joey>对  好吧  首先你得装出自然的样子
<10-5,Joey>Yeah. Okay, first of all, you want to make it look spontaneous.

213
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:54,690
<10-5,Joey>我都是这么做的 我会低头  继续低头
<10-5,Joey>So here's what I do. I look down, look down, keep looking down.

214
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,370
<10-5,Joey>然后抬头
<10-5,Joey>Then I look up.

215
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:00,660
<10-5,Joey>看到没   现在你来试试看
<10-5,Joey>See? Now you try.

216
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,140
<10-5,Joey>低头  低头  继续低头
<10-5,Joey>Look down. You're looking down. Keep looking down.

217
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,400
<10-6,Chandler>你的鞋子上为什么会有果酱
<10-6,Chandler>Why is there jelly on your shoe?

218
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,710
<10-7,Joey>我吃甜甜圈了
<10-7,Joey>I had a doughnut.

219
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:15,680
<10-9,Joey>听说昨晚你跟泰格玩得很开心
<10-9,Joey>So I heard you had some fun with Tag last night.

220
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:17,150
<10-11,Rachel>对  那家伙还不错
<10-11,Rachel>Yeah, that guy's all right.

221
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:21,490
<10-13,Rachel>对  教出另一个"乔伊"你很开心吧
<10-13,Rachel>Yeah, and you had fun teaching him how to be all "Joey."

222
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,560
<10-15,Rachel>-什么   -你懂的  泡妞
<10-15,Rachel>- What? - You know, all the women.

223
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,670
<10-16,Joey>泡妞技巧是学不来的
<10-16,Joey>You can't teach someone to be good with women.

224
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,370
<10-16,Joey>所以我跟钱德勒出去老是泡不到妞
<10-16,Joey>That's why I never had any luck with Chandler.

225
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,070
<10-17,Chandler>我就在这里
<10-17,Chandler>I'm right here.

226
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,680
<10-18,Rachel>你能不能别再跟他一起出去
<10-18,Rachel>Would you mind just not going out with him again?

227
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,220
<10-18,Rachel>就是你跟他一起去泡妞
<10-18,Rachel>Just the idea of you, and he, and all these women...

228
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:48,850
<10-18,Rachel>我知道他是我的助理  我不能跟他约会
<10-18,Rachel>I know he's my assistant, and I can't date him!

229
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:50,820
<10-18,Rachel>但这真的让我很困扰  好吗
<10-18,Rachel>But it just bothers me, all right?

230
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,720
<10-19,Joey>你不能抢走他
<10-19,Joey>No, no, no, you can't take him away from me.

231
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:57,690
<10-19,Joey>我好不容易找了个泡妞搭档
<10-19,Joey>I got a great partner to pick up girls with. Finally!

232
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,130
<10-20,Chandler>我还在这里
<10-20,Chandler>I'm still right here.

233
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:06,460
<10-20,Chandler>至少你可以跟他谈一谈
<10-20,Chandler>Will you at least talk to him...

234
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,480
<10-21,Rachel>告诉他跟一大堆女人约会既空虚
<10-21,Rachel>...and tell him how hollow and

235
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,270
<10-21,Rachel>又得不到满足
<10-21,Rachel>unsatisfying this dating-tons-of-women thing is?

236
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,540
<10-22,Joey>什么
<10-22,Joey>What?

237
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:18,390
<10-23,Rachel>在我不喜欢他之前  我不要他跟任何人约会
<10-23,Rachel>I just don't want him to meet anybody until I'm over my crush.

238
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:19,850
<10-23,Rachel>我会忘记他的
<10-23,Rachel>And I will get over it.

239
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:22,950
<10-23,Rachel>我并不爱他  那只是肉体上的吸引力
<10-23,Rachel>It's not like I love him. It's just physical.

240
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,340
<10-23,Rachel>我常常这样暗恋男人
<10-23,Rachel>I get crushes like this all the time.

241
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,060
<10-25,Chandler>刚认识你时我就暗恋过你
<10-25,Chandler>I had a crush on you at first.

242
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,160
<10-24,Joey>我知道  莫妮卡跟我说过
<10-24,Joey>I know. Monica told me.

243
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:33,130
<10-25,Chandler>我们刚认识时你暗恋过我吗
<10-25,Chandler>Did you have a crush on me when we first met?

244
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,370
<10-26,Rachel>对  有啊
<10-26,Rachel>Yeah, sure.

245
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,780
<10-27,Chandler>难道你们就是看不到我吗
<10-27,Chandler>Can you people not see me?

246
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:48,410
<10-28,Rachel>你能跟他谈谈吗
<10-28,Rachel>Will you talk to him?

247
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:49,860
<10-29,Joey>我不知道  瑞秋
<10-29,Joey>I don't know, Rach.

248
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,450
<10-30,Rachel>我会送你十件拉夫罗兰的衬衫
<10-30,Rachel>I'll give you 10 free Ralph Lauren shirts.

249
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,020
<10-30,Rachel>一件
<10-30,Rachel>One.

250
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:56,880
<10-31,Joey>不  十件  你说十件  你不能反梅
<10-31,Joey>No, 10. You said 10. You can't take that back.

251
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,490
<11-1,Tag>你有事要跟我谈
<11-1,Tag>You wanted to talk to me?

255
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:19,440
<11-4,Joey>泰格  跟太多女人约会是不好的
<11-4,Joey>Tag, there's such a thing as too many women.

256
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:22,340
<11-6,Joey>-真的吗  - 对你来说是的
<11-6,Joey>- Really? - Yeah, for you.

257
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:30,410
<12-2,Chandler>-嘿  你来了  -我来了
<12-2,Chandler>- Hey, there you are- There I am.

258
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:34,170
<12-3,Monica>-你没事吧   -没事  乔伊说我要放松
<12-3,Monica>- You okay? - Yeah, Joey said I needed to relax.

259
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,180
<12-4,Chandler>他给我吃了抗组胺药
<12-4,Chandler>So he gave me an antihistamine.

260
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:37,910
<12-5,Monica>什么
<12-5,Monica>What?

261
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,750
<12-6,Chandler>我搭地铁时睡着了结果到了布鲁克林
<12-6,Chandler>I fell asleep on the subway and went to Brooklyn.

262
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:43,480
<12-6,Chandler>布鲁克林好远
<12-6,Chandler>Brooklyn is far.

263
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:45,890
<12-7,Monica>你在想什么
<12-7,Monica>What were you thinking?

264
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,760
<12-8,Chandler>别担心   因为现在我知道要怎么拍照了
<12-8,Chandler>But don't worry, because I know how to take a picture now.

265
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:53,900
<12-8,Chandler>好了  看吧  低头
<12-8,Chandler>Okay, see. Look down.

266
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,930
<12-8,Chandler>低头
<12-8,Chandler>Look down.

267
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,240
<12-8,Chandler>低头
<12-8,Chandler>Look down.

268
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:05,740
<12-9,Monica>-钱德勒  -怎么了
<12-9,Monica>- Chandler? - Yeah?

269
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:13,920
<13-1,Phoebe>-嗨  -嗨
<13-1,Phoebe>- Hi. - Hi.

270
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:15,550
<13-2,Ross>你跟疯婆子还好吧
<13-2,Ross>How are things going with Crazy?

271
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:18,120
<13-3,Phoebe>她把你的兔子拿去煮了吗
<13-3,Phoebe>Has she cooked your rabbit yet?

272
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:22,430
<13-4,Ross>你听到的只是片面之词  好吗
<13-4,Ross>Listen, you are hearing one side of the story. Okay?

273
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:26,290
<13-4,Ross>还有  她拿了二十份油漆样本给凯尔看
<13-4,Ross>FYI, she must have shown Kyle over 30 paint samples...

274
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,130
<13-4,Ross>之后她才动手漆房间
<13-4,Ross>...before she painted that room.

275
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:32,040
<13-4,Ross>他对每一份样本的反应都是
<13-4,Ross>And his response to each one was,

276
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,410
<13-4,Ross>"我一点都不在乎"
<13-4,Ross>"I don't give a tiny rat's ass."

277
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:37,900
<13-5,Phoebe>或许她该少花点时间在装潢上
<13-5,Phoebe>Maybe she should have spent a little less time decorating...

278
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:40,450
<13-5,Phoebe>多花一点时间在卧室里
<13-5,Phoebe>...and a little more time in the bedroom.

279
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,470
<13-6,Ross>我想我们不会有那样的问题
<13-6,Ross>I don't think we are going to have that problem...

280
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,170
<13-6,Ross>但或许那是因为
<13-6,Ross>...but maybe that's just

281
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,660
<13-6,Ross>我不会吝于付出感情
<13-6,Ross>because I am not emotionally unavailable.

282
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,350
<13-7,Phoebe>你认为他吝于付出感情
<13-7,Phoebe>You think he's emotionally unavailable?

283
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,650
<13-8,Ross>我想有那个可能
<13-8,Ross>I think he can be.

284
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,790
<13-9,Phoebe>如果她没有
<13-9,Phoebe>Maybe he wouldn't be...

285
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:57,430
<13-9,Phoebe>每晚把公事带因家做或许他就不会那样子
<13-9,Phoebe>...if she didn't bring the office home every night.

286
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:00,970
<13-10,Ross>你得原谅她知道该怎么面对她的生活
<13-10,Ross>Excuse her for knowing what she wants to do with her life.

287
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:05,370
<13-11,Phoebe>她的确知道  她在1997年除夕做了什么
<13-11,Phoebe>Well, she certainly knew what she was doing New Year's Eve, 1997.

288
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:09,540
<13-12,Ross>我就知道你会那么说
<13-12,Ross>I knew you were going to throw that in my face!

289
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:13,650
<13-12,Ross>那是三年前的事  她一再地道歉
<13-12,Ross>That was three years ago. She apologized and apologized.

290
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:16,220
<13-12,Ross>你们还想怎么样
<13-12,Ross>What more do you want?

291
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,990
<13-13,Phoebe>我们要找回六年的时光
<13-13,Phoebe>We want the last six years back!

292
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:22,060
<13-14,Ross>我们也是
<13-14,Ross>So do we! So do we!

293
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:28,960
<13-14,Ross>很抱歉让你们看这一幕
<13-14,Ross>I'm sorry you had to see that.

<14-4,Rachel>Another night of bird-dogging the chicas?

298
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:46,210
<14-5,Tag>不  我们坐下来长谈
<14-5,Tag>No, we had a really good talk.

299
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,180
<14-5,Tag>我想我不会再去酒吧泡妞了
<14-5,Tag>I don't think I'm gonna do that bar scene anymore.

300
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:53,360
<14-6,Rachel>我没想到你会那么说
<14-6,Rachel>Wow, I did not see that coming.

301
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,850
<14-7,Tag>那不是真正的我
<14-7,Tag>It's just not really who I am.

302
00:17:56,060 --> 00:18:00,120
<14-7,Tag>我一直都很快乐  我为什么要告诉你这件事
<14-7,Tag>I've always been happier when... Why am I telling you this?

00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,850
<14-7,Tag>-你不会关心这种事不  -我很关心
<14-7,Tag>- You don't care about this stuff. - Yes, I do.

304
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:07,430
<14-8,Rachel>你说到"我一直都很快乐"
<14-8,Rachel>You were saying, "I'm happier when I..."

305
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,190
<14-9,Tag>当我谈恋爱时
<14-9,Tag>When I'm in a relationship.

306
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,700
<14-9,Tag>-我喜欢女朋友陪在身边  -真的吗
<14-9,Tag>- I love having a girlfriend. - Really?

307
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,100
<14-11,Tag>我可以好好宠溺她
<14-11,Tag>Someone I can spoil, you know.

308

00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:24,090
<14-14,Rachel>你相信我们都在寻找完美的另一半吗
<14-14,Rachel>Do you believe there's one perfect person for everyone?

311
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,720
<14-16,Rachel>我开始相信了
<14-16,Rachel>I'm starting to.

312
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:30,730
<14-17,Tag>如果那人已经出现  你应该去争取对吧
<14-17,Tag>If that persors in your life, should you do something about it?

313
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:32,550
<14-18,Rachel>对  当然
<14-18,Rachel>Yes. Hell, yes.

314
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,060
<14-19,Tag>那就这么定了
<14-19,Tag>All right, then, it's settled.

<14-21,Tag>-我要跟我前女友复合  -我愿意
<14-21,Tag>- I'm getting back together with my ex. - I would love to!

317
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,110
<14-24,Rachel>喂
<14-24,Rachel>Hello?

318
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,280
<14-24,Rachel>我应该会谈上一阵子  对不起
<14-24,Rachel>This is gonna be a while. Excuse me.

319
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,110
<14-24,Rachel>好

00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:07,620
<15-1,Ross>天啊

322
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:11,800
<15-2,Phoebe>对不起  吵到你了吗
<15-2,Phoebe>Oh, I'm sorry. Is that annoying?

323
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:14,970
<15-2,Phoebe>说到在床上很自私  惠特妮还好吗
<15-2,Phoebe>And speaking of being selfish in bed, how's Whitney?

324
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:19,610
<15-3,Ross>也许她其实可以很无私
<15-3,Ross>Maybe she wouldn't have to be selfish in bed...

325
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:22,610
<15-3,Ross>如果另一个人知道正确位置的话
<15-3,Ross>...if someone else knew where everything was.

326
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:25,580
<15-4,Phoebe>他的确知道
<15-4,Phoebe>Oh, he knows.

327
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:27,370
<15-4,Phoebe>大部份啦
<15-4,Phoebe>For the most part.

328
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:32,150
<15-5,Kyle>嘿  太好了  你们两个都在
<15-5,Kyle>Oh, hey. Good, you're both here.

329
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:34,280
<15-6,Whitney>我们得谈一谈
<15-6,Whitney>We kind of need to talk.

330
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:36,720
<15-7,Phoebe>-两个人一起  -怎么了
<15-7,Phoebe>- Both of you, together? - What's up?

331
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:41,160
<15-8,Ross>昨晚我到凯尔家拿一些东西
<15-8,Ross>Well, I went over to Kyle's last night to pick up a few things...

332
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,130
<15-9,Whitney>我们回忆了一些往事
<15-9,Whitney>...and we got to reminiscing.

333
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:45,960
<15-10,Kyle>几乎彻谈整晚
<15-10,Kyle>We talked most of the night...

334
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:48,600
<15-10,Kyle>我们明白  我们会这么气对方
<15-10,Kyle>...and realized the reason we're angry with each other...

335
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,830
<15-10,Kyle>是因为我们还对彼此有感觉
<15-10,Kyle>...is because there are still feelings there.

336
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,540
<15-10,Kyle>所以
<15-10,Kyle>So...

337
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:59,810
<15-11,Ross>快说吧  凯尔
<15-11,Ross>Oh, just say it, Kyle!

338
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,350
<15-12,Kyle>我们要重新开始
<15-12,Kyle>We're gonna try again.

339
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:08,650
<15-13,Phoebe>你不是说她爱抱怨常常要人关注她吗
<15-13,Phoebe>What about her whining, and her constant need for attention?

340
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,020
<15-14,Whitney>我会努力调整
<15-14,Whitney>I'm gonna work on that.

341
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:12,520
<15-15,Phoebe>对  因为你很擅长改变
<15-15,Phoebe>Right, because you're so capable of change.

342
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,190
<15-16,Ross>他会边尿边哼歌
<15-16,Ross>You know, he hums when he pees.

343
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:22,430
<15-18,Ross>-我知道  -所以他都尿不准  随便啦
<15-18,Ross>- I do know. - Makes him miss the bowl, but whatever.

344
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:25,440
<15-19,Whitney>我们很抱歉
<15-19,Whitney>We're so sorry.

345
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:30,080
<15-20,Ross>没关系我们不需要你们  我已经忘了这件事
<15-20,Ross>That's all right. We don't need you. I'm over it already.

346
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:33,510
<15-21,Phoebe>对  我根本一点都不在乎
<15-21,Phoebe>Yeah, and I don't even give a tiny rat's ass.

347
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,850
<15-22,Kyle>我们得走了
<15-22,Kyle>Yeah, we're gonna go.

348
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,680
<15-22,Kyle>对不起

00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:47,260
<15-23,Ross>菲比  你没有看错她
<15-23,Ross>Pheebs, you were right about her.

350
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,230
<15-23,Ross>她的确试图把性当成武器
