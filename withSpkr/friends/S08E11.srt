1
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:06,280
<1-3,Rachel>菲比  快看窗边那个男的
<1-3,Rachel>Phoebe. Will you check out that guy by the window.

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,920
<1-4,Phoebe>他矮得出奇
<1-4,Phoebe>He's awfully short.

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,380
<1-4,Phoebe>而且我觉得他在自言自语
<1-4,Phoebe>And I think he's talking to himself.

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,790
<1-4,Phoebe>老实说  他的床上功夫不怎么样
<1-4,Phoebe>And to be completely honest, he's not that good in bed.

5
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:18,290
<1-5,Rachel>我最近是怎么了
<1-5,Rachel>What is wrong with me lately?

6
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:20,770
<1-5,Rachel>我对看到的每个男人都心动
<1-5,Rachel>It's like, every guy I see.

7
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:22,630
<1-5,Rachel>譬如说那个男的
<1-5,Rachel>I mean, look at that guy, for example.

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,360
<1-5,Rachel>他不是我喜欢的那一型
<1-5,Rachel>That's not someone I would be attracted to.

9
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:28,330
<1-5,Rachel>但凭我现在的感觉
<1-5,Rachel>But right now, with the way I'm feeling,

10
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:32,150
<1-5,Rachel>我一心想撕开他的运动裤跟腰包
<1-5,Rachel>all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack.

11
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,770
<1-6,Phoebe>等一下
<1-6,Phoebe>Wait a second!

12
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,190
<1-6,Phoebe>你怀孕大概四个月了吧
<1-6,Phoebe>This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?

13
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:39,210
<1-8,Phoebe>-对  -这再正常不过了
<1-8,Phoebe>- Yeah. - This is completely normal.

14
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:41,840
<1-8,Phoebe>怀孕四个月时  你的荷尔蒙分泌会失控
<1-8,Phoebe>Around the fourth month, your hormones start going crazy.

15
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,290
<1-9,Rachel>-真的吗  你当时也是这样吗  -没错
<1-9,Rachel>- Really? So this has happened to you? - Absolutely! Yeah.

16
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:47,940
<1-10,Phoebe>别忘了我怀的是三胞胎
<1-10,Phoebe>And keep in mind now, I was carrying triplets.

17
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,720
<1-10,Phoebe>从医学上来说  我的欲望要比你强三倍
<1-10,Phoebe>So in medical terms, I was thrice as randy.

18
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,230
<1-11,Rachel>原来是这么一回事
<1-11,Rachel>Wow, this explains so much!

19
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:58,130
<1-11,Rachel>上周末我走遍每一家商店
<1-11,Rachel>Last weekend, I went from store to store,

20
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:00,020
<1-11,Rachel>坐在圣诞老人的大腿上
<1-11,Rachel>sitting on Santas' laps.

21
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,560
<1-12,Phoebe>对  我记得我当时想要从健身房
<1-12,Phoebe>Yeah, I remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout...

22
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,060
<1-12,Phoebe>偷走艾凡德·霍利菲尔德的人形立牌
<1-12,Phoebe>...of Evander Holyfield from a Foot Locker.

24
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,610
<1-14,Phoebe>明天我得去看医生  我到时问问她
<1-14,Phoebe>Well, I go see my doctor tomorrow. I'll ask her about this.

25
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:14,440
<1-15,Rachel>或许她可以开个药给我吃
<1-15,Rachel>Maybe she can give me a pill or something.

26
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,180
<1-16,Phoebe>对  你正是需要吃药  对症"下药"
<1-16,Phoebe>Yeah, that's what you need. A good pill.

38
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:01,460
<2-3,Mona>我把我们到洛克菲勒中心的照片洗出来了
<2-3,Mona>I got our pictures developed from Rockefeller Center.

39
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,600
<2-4,Ross>太棒了  乔伊  你想看我跟蒙娜
<2-4,Ross>Great. Hey, Joey, want to check out pictures

40
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:05,440
<2-4,Ross>去溜冰的照片吗
<2-4,Ross>of me and Mona ice-skating?

41
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,110
<2-5,Joey>换做平常我会想看
<2-5,Joey>Ordinarily, I would love to,

42
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:10,790
<2-5,Joey>但现在我真的好忙
<2-5,Joey>but I am just swamped right now.

43
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:16,910
<2-6,Ross>那个怪怪的咸酥饼小贩
<2-6,Ross>Where are the pictures that

44
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,720
<2-6,Ross>帮我们合拍的照片在哪里
<2-6,Ross>that creepy pretzel vendor took of us together?

45
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,660
<2-7,Mona>对  或许在最后面
<2-7,Mona>Oh, yeah. Probably at the end.

46
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:26,440
<2-7,Mona>天啊  他只拍了我的胸部
<2-7,Mona>Oh, my God! All he took were pictures of my breasts.

47
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,310
<2-8,Joey>我也想看照片
<2-8,Joey>I'm missing picture time!

48
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:36,250
<2-9,Phoebe>她长得也不错耶  罗斯
<2-9,Phoebe>You know, she has a face, Ross.

49
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,620
<2-10,Mona>我们这张合照很不错
<2-10,Mona>- Okay, here's a good one of us.

50
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:44,140
<2-11,Ross>这张真的很棒  看起来很像节日贺卡
<2-11,Ross>Wow, that is a good one! It looks like a holiday card.

51
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:47,830
<2-11,Ross>中间有树  还有溜冰客和雪
<2-11,Ross>With the tree in the middle and the skaters and the snow.

52
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:49,830
<2-12,Mona>每年我都说要寄节日贺卡
<2-12,Mona>Every year, I say I'm gonna send out

53
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,240
<2-12,Mona>但从来都没着手去做
<2-12,Mona>holiday cards and I never do it.

54
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,440
<2-12,Mona>你要跟我一起寄这张卡片吗
<2-12,Mona>Do you want to send this one out together?

55
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:01,400
<2-13,Ross>一起寄我们的合照给大家
<2-13,Ross>Together? Like, to people?

56
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,540
<2-14,Mona>对  "佳节愉快  蒙娜跟罗斯上"
<2-14,Mona>Yeah. "Happy holidays, from Mona and Ross."

57
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,060
<2-14,Mona>一定会很棒  对吧
<2-14,Mona>It'll be cute, okay?

58
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:07,940
<2-15,Ross>好吧
<2-15,Ross>Okay.

59
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,130
<2-16,Mona>我得去上班了

<2-19,Phoebe>Congratulations! You just got married!

63
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,410
<2-21,Ross>我知道  你敢相信吗
<2-21,Ross>I know. Can you believe that?

64
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:25,370
<2-22,Phoebe>抱歉  一张贺卡有什么大不了的
<2-22,Phoebe>I'm sorry. What's the big deal about a holiday card?

65
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:29,330
<2-23,Ross>已婚夫妻跟家人才会一起寄照片
<2-23,Ross>Married couples send out cards. Families send out cards.

66
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:31,330
<2-23,Ross>约会了几个月的情侣
<2-23,Ross>People who have been dating for a couple of months

67
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:32,790
<2-23,Ross>不会一起寄卡片
<2-23,Ross>don't send out cards.

68
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,490
<2-23,Ross>她疯了吗
<2-23,Ross>What is she, crazy?

69
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:36,760
<2-24,Joey>你说的人可是你老婆
<2-24,Joey>That's your wife you're talking about!

70
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:41,680
<3-1,Doug>宾  还有宾太太
<3-1,Doug>Bing! And the Bingette!

71
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:44,750
<3-2,Chandler>-老婆  你记得我老板道格吧  -记得
<3-2,Chandler>- Oh, honey, you remember my boss, Doug. - Yes. Hi.

72
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,610
<3-4,Doug>好消息  我已经离婚了
<3-4,Doug>Hi. So, good news! The divorce is final.

73
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,290
<3-4,Doug>我今天早上签了文件
<3-4,Doug>I signed the papers this a.m.

74
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:51,750
<3-5,Chandler>我不知道你跟卡拉离婚了  我很遗憾
<3-5,Chandler>I didn't know you and Kara divorced. I'm sorry.

75
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:55,280
<3-6,Doug>遗憾  我终于可以脱离苦海了
<3-6,Doug>Sorry? I finally chewed my leg out of that bear trap.

76
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,960
<3-6,Doug>不过还是恭喜你们
<3-6,Doug>Congratulations to you guys, though.

77
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,510
<3-7,Monica>我们感情好着呢
<3-7,Monica>No leg-chewing for us, sir.

78
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,250
<3-8,Doug>等着瞧吧
<3-8,Doug>Well, give it time.

79
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:08,500
<3-8,Doug>你们刚结婚  我刚离婚  该好好庆祝一番
<3-8,Doug>So the divorce, the marriage, we got a lot to celebrate.

80
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,720
<3-8,Doug>我们何不明晚一起吃晚餐
<3-8,Doug>How about we all go out to dinner tomorrow night.

81
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,510
<3-9,Monica>我想不出来我们明晚要做什么事
<3-9,Monica>I can't think of anything we're doing.

82
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,270
<3-9,Monica>为什么我想不出来我们明晚要做什么事
<3-9,Monica>Why can't I think of anything we're doing?

83
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:20,280
<3-10,Doug>那就定在明晚  我六点应该能离开法庭
<3-10,Doug>Tomorrow night it is. I should be out of court by 6.

84
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,530
<3-10,Doug>他们一直拿性骚扰案扔给我
<3-10,Doug>They keep throwing sexual harassment cases at me...

85
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:24,820
<3-10,Doug>我总能把他们打得毫无退路
<3-10,Doug>...and I keep knocking them out of the park!

86
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:27,680
<3-11,Monica>好吧  明天见
<3-11,Monica>Okay, see you tomorrow.

87
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:30,630
<3-11,Monica>你要知道  我们明天不能跟他见面
<3-11,Monica>Just so you know, we're not seeing him tomorrow.

88
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,210
<3-11,Monica>我没办法再跟他共度一个夜晚
<3-11,Monica>I can't spend another evening with that man.

89
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:36,400
<3-11,Monica>你记得他在我们的婚礼上做了什么吗
<3-11,Monica>Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding?

90
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:38,970
<3-13,Monica>-不记得  -那是因为我们没有邀请他
<3-13,Monica>- No. - That's because he wasn't invited.

91
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:42,290
<3-13,Monica>因为他在我们的订婚派对上为非作歹
<3-13,Monica>Because of the way he behaved at our engagement party.

92
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:46,470
<3-14,Chandler>对  小便直接喷中了冰雕  对吧
<3-14,Chandler>Oh, yeah! Urine cuts right through an ice sculpture, doesn't it?

93
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,800
<4-2,Ross>我去过照相馆了  你看
<4-2,Ross>Hi! I went by the photo shop. Take a look.

94
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:59,750
<4-3,Mona>这是卡片的初稿  你觉得怎样
<4-3,Mona>Here is a mockup of our card. What do you think?

95
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:05,110
<4-4,Ross>真的很棒
<4-4,Ross>Wow, that's great.

96
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:07,830
<4-5,Mona>你觉得我们该写上"爱你们的罗斯跟蒙娜"吗
<4-5,Mona>Do you think it should say, "Love, Ross and Mona"?

97
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:11,600
<4-6,Ross>我们还没有对彼此说过"爱"
<4-6,Ross>Well, we haven't said that to each other yet...

98
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,900
<4-6,Ross>但我猜跟其他人说说应该没关系
<4-6,Ross>...but I guess it's okay to say it to other people.

99
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:18,150
<4-7,Mona>你要多少张
<4-7,Mona>How many did you want?

100
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:20,690
<4-7,Mona>-我要100张  -100张
<4-7,Mona>- I'll get 100.- A hundred?

101
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:26,470
<4-8,Ross>那我就要...
<4-8,Ross>Well, I guess I'll take...

102
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,130
<4-8,Ross>蒙娜
<4-8,Ross>Mona?

103
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:35,140
<4-8,Ross>我不确定印卡片这件事妥不妥
<4-8,Ross>I'm not sure about the whole card thing.

104
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:37,060
<4-9,Mona>真的吗  为什么
<4-9,Mona>Really? Why not?

105
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:41,260
<4-10,Ross>我们一起寄节日贺卡
<4-10,Ross>Sending out a holiday card together?

106
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:46,110
<4-10,Ross>我不知道我们之间是不是到那个地步了
<4-10,Ross>I just don't know if we're really quite there yet.

107
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:51,030
<4-11,Mona>我没想到那一点  你说得对
<4-11,Mona>I didn't think of it that way. You're right. You're right.

108
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:57,550
<4-11,Mona>-我能问你一个问题吗  -好啊
<4-11,Mona>- So can I ask you a question? - Yeah.

109
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,830
<4-13,Mona>我们到哪个地步了
<4-13,Mona>Where are we?

110
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:03,180
<4-14,Ross>我们到哪个地步了
<4-14,Ross>You know, like where are we?

111
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:05,580
<4-15,Mona>我们会有什么结局
<4-15,Mona>Where is this relationship going?

112
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:14,050
<4-16,Ross>我喜欢跟你待在一起
<4-16,Ross>I mean, I love spending time with you.

113
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,050
<4-17,Mona>我只是希望我们在往前走
<4-17,Mona>I just hope we're moving forward.

114
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:18,830
<4-17,Mona>我们该谈一谈  你不觉得吗
<4-17,Mona>We should talk about that, don't you think?

115
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,500
<4-18,Ross>我们一起印卡片吧
<4-18,Ross>Let's do the card!

116
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:34,130
<4-20,Ross>-什么  -卡片  我想我们到这个地步了
<4-20,Ross>- What? - The card! I think we're there!

117
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:38,900
<4-21,Mona>好吧  但我还是觉得我们应该谈一谈
<4-21,Mona>Okay. But I still think we should have this conversation.

118
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,770
<4-22,Ross>真的吗
<4-22,Ross>Really? I mean...

119
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:43,570
<4-22,Ross>印了卡片还是要谈吗
<4-22,Ross>Even with the card?

120
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,070
<5-2,Rachel>朗医生今天没办法过来
<5-2,Rachel>Just so you know, Dr. Long can't be here today,

121
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:54,940
<5-3,Nurse>她有事去医院了  辛夫医生会帮你检查
<5-3,Nurse>she was called to the hospital, so Dr. Schiff will be seeing you.

122
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:58,150
<5-3,Nurse>好吧  我能问你一个问题吗
<5-3,Nurse>Oh, okay. Can I ask you a question?

123
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,950
<5-4,Rachel>是我的问题  还是帮我抽血的那个家伙
<5-4,Rachel>Was it me, or was the guy who took my blood sample

124
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,640
<5-4,Rachel>真的很帅
<5-4,Rachel>really cute?

125
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,780
<5-4,Rachel>你知道我在说谁吗
<5-4,Rachel>You know who I'm talking about?

126
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:07,170
<5-4,Rachel>锅盖头  手指满是毛的家伙
<5-4,Rachel>Bowl haircut, hairy fingers?

127
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,620
<5-5,Dr. Schiff>-瑞秋吗  我是辛夫医生  -是啊
<5-5,Dr. Schiff>- Hi, Rachel? I'm Dr. Schiff. - Yes, you are.

128
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:16,920
<5-7,Dr. Schiff>情况如何
<5-7,Dr. Schiff>So, how's it going?

129
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:20,090
<5-8,Rachel>真的很不错  但别谈我了
<5-8,Rachel>It's going really good. But enough about me! Come on.

130
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:23,760
<5-8,Rachel>你是哪里人  你是做哪一行的
<5-8,Rachel>Where are you from? What do you do?

131
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,240
<5-9,Dr. Schiff>-我是医生  -对  我是指...
<5-9,Dr. Schiff>- I'm a doctor. - Right. I meant...

132
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,700
<5-10,Rachel>你有空的时候  你会煮饭或滑雪吗
<5-10,Rachel>...in your spare time. Do you cook? So you ski?

133
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,520
<5-10,Rachel>还是会跟太太或女朋友一起出去玩
<5-10,Rachel>Or just hang out with your wife, or girlfriend?

134
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:38,400
<5-11,Dr. Schiff>我没有太太或女朋友  但我很喜欢滑雪
<5-11,Dr. Schiff>I don't have a wife or a girlfriend, but I do like to ski.

135
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,970
<5-12,Rachel>我也喜欢滑雪  我们简直太有缘了
<5-12,Rachel>I love to ski! How amazing is this?

136
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,650
<5-13,Dr. Schiff>你最近有任何不适症状吗
<5-13,Dr. Schiff>Are you experiencing any discomfort?

137
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:47,570
<5-14,Rachel>不  我非常舒服
<5-14,Rachel>No, I'm very comfortable.

138
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:50,650
<5-15,Dr. Schiff>-放屁会不舒服吗  -不会
<5-15,Dr. Schiff>- Any painful gas? - No!

139
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,820
<5-16,Rachel>辛夫医生  那是哪门子的问题
<5-16,Rachel>No! Shoot, Dr. Schiff! What kind of question is that?

140
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,030
<5-17,Dr. Schiff>好吧  能麻烦你躺下来吗
<5-17,Dr. Schiff>Okay, then. Would you like to lie down on the table?

141
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:03,280
<5-18,Rachel>你想让我躺下来吗
<5-18,Rachel>Would you like me to lie down on the table?

142
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,890
<5-19,Dr. Schiff>抱歉  我们之间是不是有什么情况
<5-19,Dr. Schiff>I'm sorry. Is there something going on here?

143
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:08,490
<5-20,Rachel>你也感觉到了吗
<5-20,Rachel>Do you feel it too?

144
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:17,010
<6-2,Phoebe>门诊看得如何
<6-2,Phoebe>So, how did your doctor's appointment go?

145
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:18,870
<6-2,Phoebe>让我想一想
<6-2,Phoebe>Well, let's see,

146
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:21,240
<6-3,Rachel>今天他们派了一个"帅哥"医生给我
<6-3,Rachel>they gave me "cute boy" doctor today.

147
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:25,820
<6-3,Rachel>检查到一半  我把小指放到他的下巴酒窝里了
<6-3,Rachel>In the middle of the exam, I put my pinkie in his chin dimple.

148
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:29,230
<6-5,Monica>-天啊  -你为什么要那么做
<6-5,Monica>- Oh, my God! - Why did you do that?

149
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,870
<6-6,Phoebe>还记得我怀孕四个月时
<6-6,Phoebe>Remember that little problem

150
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:33,480
<6-6,Phoebe>遇到的那个小问题吗
<6-6,Phoebe>I was having during my fourth month of pregnancy?

151
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,680
<6-7,Monica>对  艾凡德·霍利菲尔德的人形立牌
<6-7,Monica>Oh, yeah! The Evander Holyfield phase.

152
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:40,880
<6-7,Monica>天啊  你当时病急乱投医  甚至朝我扑过来
<6-7,Monica>Oh, man! You were so hard up, you practically came on to me.

153
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,290
<6-8,Phoebe>少做梦了
<6-8,Phoebe>You wish.

154
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,790
<6-9,Monica>如果我真的想要你  完全可以钓到你
<6-9,Monica>Hey, I could have had you if I wanted you.

155
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:48,450
<6-10,Phoebe>是吗  来试试看吧
<6-10,Phoebe>Oh, yeah? Come and get it.

156
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:51,660
<6-11,Rachel>好了  连这段对话都能挑起我的欲望
<6-11,Rachel>Okay, even this is turning me on...

157
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,220
<6-12,Ross>罗斯
<6-12,Ross>Hey, Ross!

158
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,280
<6-13,Rachel>你跟蒙娜还好吧
<6-13,Rachel>How's it going with you and Mona?

159
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,970
<6-13,Rachel>你们还在一起吗
<6-13,Rachel>Are you guys still together?

160
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:05,760
<6-14,Ross>对  我们有所进展  你们会收到我们的卡片
<6-14,Ross>Yeah, we're moving forward. You'll be getting our card.

161
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:09,560
<6-15,Monica>你们要一起寄节日贺卡吗
<6-15,Monica>You're doing a holiday card together?

162
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,130
<6-16,Ross>我们不只要寄节日贺卡
<6-16,Ross>We're not just doing a card.

163
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:13,050
<6-16,Ross>她还要谈一谈
<6-16,Ross>She also wants to have the conversation...

164
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:15,270
<6-16,Ross>我们会有什么结局
<6-16,Ross>...about where the relationship is going.

165
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:16,920
<6-17,Phoebe>女人啊
<6-17,Phoebe>Women!

166
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,560
<6-18,Ross>就是嘛  为什么你们想要谈这种问题
<6-18,Ross>I know! Why do you guys need to have this conversation?

167
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:24,330
<6-18,Ross>懂得自我尊重的男人不会问女人
<6-18,Ross>No self-respecting man would ask a woman,

168
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:25,830
<6-18,Ross>"我们会有什么结局"
<6-18,Ross>"So where is this going?"

169
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,810
<6-19,Rachel>罗斯  你问过我
<6-19,Rachel>Ross, you asked me that.

170
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,190
<6-20,Ross>你像是本合上的书  好吗
<6-20,Ross>You were a closed book, okay?

171
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:32,020
<6-20,Ross>我又不会读心术
<6-20,Ross>I'm not a mind reader!

172
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,830
<6-20,Ross>而且我讨厌谈那种话题
<6-20,Ross>Besides, I hate those conversations.

173
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:38,300
<6-20,Ross>我真的不大会应付那种对话
<6-20,Ross>I'm horrible at them. Really.

174
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,850
<6-20,Ross>或许我需要暗示她
<6-20,Ross>Maybe I need some kind of a gesture...

175
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:43,830
<6-20,Ross>我们的确有进展
<6-20,Ross>...something that says we're moving forward

176
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:45,430
<6-20,Ross>而不必去谈这件事
<6-20,Ross>without having to talk about it.

177
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:47,330
<6-21,Monica>像是请她搬去跟你一起住
<6-21,Monica>Like asking her to move in with you?

178
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,770
<6-22,Ross>这有点过了
<6-22,Ross>Smaller than that.

179
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:53,600
<6-23,Monica>-帮她录集锦录音带  -又欠点火候
<6-23,Monica>- Making her a mix tape? - Bigger than that.

180
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,650
<6-25,Phoebe>给她你家的钥匙
<6-25,Phoebe>Give her a key to your apartment.

181
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:58,480
<6-26,Ross>我们的感情还是更接近送录音带的程度
<6-26,Ross>Hello. We were closer with the mix tape.

182
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,100
<6-27,Monica>你说过"我爱你"吗  你可以说"我爱你"
<6-27,Monica>Have you said, "I love you"? You could say, "I love you."

183
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,400
<6-28,Ross>我觉得我还没有到那个地步
<6-28,Ross>I don't think I'm quite there yet.

184
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,900
<6-28,Ross>但我可以说"我喜欢跟你在一起"
<6-28,Ross>But I could say, "I love spending time with you."

185
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:09,970
<6-29,Phoebe>我们讨厌那句话
<6-29,Phoebe>We hate that.

186
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:11,390
<6-30,Monica>简直就像是被人闪了一巴掌
<6-30,Monica>That is a slap in the face.

187
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:16,610
<6-31,Ross>算了  我还是去跟她谈吧
<6-31,Ross>Forget it. You know what? I'll just have the conversation.

188
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,320
<6-31,Ross>我会说我喜欢我们现在的样子
<6-31,Ross>I'll just say I like things the way they are,

189
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,670
<6-31,Ross>并怀着最好的期待
<6-31,Ross>and hope for the best.

190
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:24,290
<6-31,Ross>你觉得呢  瑞秋
<6-31,Ross>What do you think, Rach?

191
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:28,110
<6-32,Rachel>我想如果这里再冷一点
<6-32,Rachel>I think if it was a little colder in here...

192
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:30,700
<6-32,Rachel>我可以看到你乳头凸显
<6-32,Rachel>...I could see your nipples through that sweater.

193
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:38,140
<7-1,Doug>宾  我们今晚八点出发
<7-1,Doug>Bing? We're all set for tonight, 8:00.

194
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:41,660
<7-2,Chandler>我们去不成了  莫妮卡得上班
<7-2,Chandler>As it turns out, we can't do it. Monica has to work.

195
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,270
<7-3,Doug>我前妻不上班
<7-3,Doug>My ex-wife didn't work.

196
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,940
<7-3,Doug>除非你说回娘家是"上班"
<7-3,Doug>Unless you call turning into her mother "work."

197
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,830
<7-3,Doug>好吧  那就明天晚上吧
<7-3,Doug>Fine. Tomorrow night then.

198
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:55,850
<7-4,Chandler>-她明晚也不能来  -为什么
<7-4,Chandler>- Tomorrow's no good for her, either. - Why not?

199
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:58,300
<7-5,Doug>草地保龄球巡回赛
<7-5,Doug>It's the semifinals...

200
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,510
<7-6,Chandler>要打半决赛
<7-6,Chandler>...of her bocce ball tournament.

201
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,800
<7-7,Doug>发生了什么事  宾
<7-7,Doug>What's going on, Bing?

202
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,660
<7-7,Doug>你老婆不喜欢我吗
<7-7,Doug>Does your wife have a problem with me or something?

203
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,940
<7-8,Chandler>你这话说得太离谱了
<7-8,Chandler>Well, now you're just talking crazy.

204
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:15,770
<7-9,Doug>那我们三个为什么不能一起出去玩
<7-9,Doug>Then why can't the three of us go out together?

205
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:19,860
<7-10,Chandler>因为我们分居了
<7-10,Chandler>Because we split up.

206
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:21,490
<7-10,Chandler>莫妮卡跟我分居了
<7-10,Chandler>Monica and I split up.

207
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,870
<7-10,Chandler>抱着我
<7-10,Chandler>Hold me.

208
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:30,430
<7-11,Doug>天啊  宾  我倒也不觉得诧异
<7-11,Doug>Good God, Bing. Well, I can't say I'm altogether surprised.

209
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:34,900
<7-11,Doug>我看到她看你的眼神  就知道她不爱你
<7-11,Doug>I saw the way she looked at you, and there was no love there.

210
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,860
<7-11,Doug>而她看着我时却充满了爱欲
<7-11,Doug>And the way she looked at me, pure lust.

211
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,920
<7-12,Chandler>在这种时候  只有掐人脖子
<7-12,Chandler>What would really help me through this tough time

212
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,000
<7-12,Chandler>才能让我泄愤  我能掐你吗
<7-12,Chandler>is choking someone. Can I choke you?

213
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:49,800
<7-13,Doug>宾  孩子  我得让你放下这件事
<7-13,Doug>Bing, my boy, we're gonna get you over this.

214
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:51,000
<7-13,Doug>我有个计划
<7-13,Doug>Here's the plan:

215
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,810
<7-13,Doug>拿着你的外套  我们去脱衣舞俱乐部
<7-13,Doug>Grab your coat, we're going to a strip club!

216
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,850
<7-14,Chandler>不  莫妮卡会生气的
<7-14,Chandler>Oh, no! Monica would freak.

217
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,250
<7-14,Chandler>但谁管那个臭女人呢
<7-14,Chandler>But to hell with that bitch!

218
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,340
<8-1,Ross>咖啡来了
<8-1,Ross>Here we go.

219
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:09,340
<8-1,Ross>蒙娜  我们该谈谈
<8-1,Ross>Mona, it's time we had a conversation

220
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:12,550
<8-1,Ross>我们之间的关系了
<8-1,Ross>about where things are with us.

221
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:15,540
<8-2,Mona>是啊  那还是我先提出来的
<8-2,Mona>Yeah, I think I suggested that.

222
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,000
<8-3,Ross>我们简直...
<8-3,Ross>We are so...

223
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,320
<8-3,Ross>我真的很喜欢你
<8-3,Ross>Well, I really like you.

224
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,230
<8-3,Ross>我喜欢跟你在一起
<8-3,Ross>And I love hanging out with you.

225
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:33,700
<8-3,Ross>和你相处  我非常开心
<8-3,Ross>And I'm having a lot of fun.

226
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,310
<8-4,Mona>好吧
<8-4,Mona>Okay.

227
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:45,810
<8-5,Ross>如果只是为了好玩  我们就不必交往了
<8-5,Ross>There's no point in spending time with someone if it's just fun.

228
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:49,490
<8-5,Ross>我们得有结果  对吧
<8-5,Ross>It's gotta be going somewhere, right?

229
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,640
<8-5,Ross>我们会有什么结果
<8-5,Ross>So where is it going?

230
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:01,750
<8-5,Ross>这才是实质性的问题
<8-5,Ross>That's the real question.

231
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:08,280
<8-5,Ross>答案是...
<8-5,Ross>And the answer is...

232
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,420
<8-5,Ross>我们会相处得...
<8-5,Ross>...it's going somewhere...

233
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,690
<8-7,Ross>很开心
<8-7,Ross>...fun.

234
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,890
<8-4,Mona>我知道你在想什么
<8-4,Mona>I know what you're thinking.

235
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:21,630
<8-5,Ross>如果是十年前  还可以找找乐子
<8-5,Ross>Fun was fine for you 10 years ago.

236
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:24,170
<8-5,Ross>但现在你也不年轻了
<8-5,Ross>But you're not getting any younger.

237
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,370
<8-5,Ross>我不是说你  不是你
<8-5,Ross>No! I mean, not you. Not you.

238
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:30,510
<8-5,Ross>你越来越年轻了
<8-5,Ross>You are getting younger!

239
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,530
<8-5,Ross>你每一秒都在变年轻
<8-5,Ross>You're getting younger by the second.

240
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:36,280
<8-5,Ross>你有什么秘诀
<8-5,Ross>What's your secret?

241
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:42,220
<8-6,Mona>抱歉  我们发展到哪一步了
<8-6,Mona>I'm sorry, so where are we?

242
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,330
<8-7,Ross>总而言之...
<8-7,Ross>Well, to sum up...

243

00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:00,280
<8-9,Ross>-好吧...  -但这还远远不够

00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:28,470
<9-1,Rachel>你给了她你家的钥匙
<9-1,Rachel>You gave her a key to your apartment?

251
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:32,220
<9-2,Ross>不仅是那样  我把唯一的钥匙给了她
<9-2,Ross>Not just a key. I gave her the only key!

252
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,330
<9-2,Ross>我现在是个陷入认真感情  无家可归的家伙
<9-2,Ross>I am now a homeless person in a very serious relationship!

<9-19,Rachel>我不会随便跟男人上床
<9-19,Rachel>I won't do it with some random guy!

269
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:41,460
<9-20,Phoebe>好吧  那么你去告诉罗杰
<9-20,Phoebe>Fine! Then you tell Roger,

00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,870
<9-20,Phoebe>因为他真的很期待这场艳遇
<9-20,Phoebe>because he was really looking forward to this!

271
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:05,370
<10-1,Doug>宾  快看那对双胞胎姐妹一起跳舞
<10-1,Doug>Bing! Look at those twin sisters dancing together.

<10-1,Doug>我出钱请她们在你大腿上跳艳舞吧
<10-1,Doug>Let me buy you a lap dance with those girls.

273
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:12,900
<10-2,Chandler>不用了  而且只有一个女孩在跳舞
<10-2,Chandler>That's all right, sir. And that's just one girl.

274
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:18,020
<10-4,Chandler>-宾  这是什么  -那是我的手
<10-4,Chandler>- Bing, what's this? - It's a hand.

275
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:20,550
<10-4,Chandler>用来帮你端酒的工具
<10-4,Chandler>It's a thing you use as a Jack and Coke holder.

276
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,280
<10-5,Doug>不  是婚戒  你得把它丢掉
<10-5,Doug>No. It's a wedding ring. You gotta get rid of it.

277
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,570
<10-5,Doug>我们现在就到东河把它扔下去
<10-5,Doug>We're gonna go to the East River right now and throw it in there!

278
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:27,220
<10-6,Chandler>-不要  -要
<10-6,Chandler>- No! - Yes!

279
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,200
<10-7,Doug>我就那么做了  感觉好很多
<10-7,Doug>I did it, and I felt a lot better!

280
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,150
<10-7,Doug>如果你仍得有准头  甚至可能会打中海鸥
<10-7,Doug>And if you whip it just right you might hit a seagull in the head.

281
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:38,200
<11-1,Ross>好吧  我需要一堆备用钥匙
<11-1,Ross>Okay. I'm gonna need a bunch of extra keys.

282
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,560
<11-1,Ross>很明显  我会毫无理由地把钥匙送人
<11-1,Ross>Apparently, I give them away for no reason at all.

283
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:47,690
<11-2,Mona>罗斯  发生了什么事  你在换锁
<11-2,Mona>Ross, what's going on? You're changing the lock?

284
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:48,760
<11-2,Mona>不是
<11-2,Mona>No.

285
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,780
<11-3,Ross>是那个家伙在换锁
<11-3,Ross>That guy is.

286
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,360
<11-4,Mona>我这就不懂了  你刚把你家的钥匙给我
<11-4,Mona>I don't understand. You give me a key to your apartment,

287
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,230
<11-4,Mona>然后你就把锁换了
<11-4,Mona>and then you change the lock?

288
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:58,760
<11-5,Locksmith>祝你好运  哥们
<11-5,Locksmith>Good luck, buddy.

289
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,520
<11-6,Mona>我以为我们往前迈进了一步
<11-6,Mona>I thought we were moving forward.

290
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:08,080
<11-6,Mona>而现在你却向我发送各种混乱讯息
<11-6,Mona>Now you're sending me all these mixed signals.

291
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:10,150
<11-6,Mona>你到底想告诉我什么
<11-6,Mona>What are you trying to tell me?

292
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:14,020
<11-7,Ross>我想告诉你...
<11-7,Ross>I'm trying to tell you...

293
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:18,190
<11-7,Ross>我帮你录了一卷集锦录音带
<11-7,Ross>...I made you a mix tape.

294
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:22,010
<11-9,Ross>-什么  -我爱你
<11-9,Ross>- What? - I love you.

295
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,400
<11-10,Mona>我喜欢跟你在一起
<11-10,Mona>And I love spending time with you.

296
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,460
<12-1,Chandler>老婆  我回来了
<12-1,Chandler>Hi, honey, I'm home.

297
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,050
<12-2,Monica>从龙舌兰酒工厂回来的
<12-2,Monica>From the tequila factory?

298
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:44,420
<12-3,Chandler>感觉糟透了
<12-3,Chandler>It was awful.

299
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,900
<12-3,Chandler>为了逃避跟道格的晚餐约会
<12-3,Chandler>To get out of going to dinner with Doug,

300
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,920
<12-3,Chandler>我告诉他你跟我分居了
<12-3,Chandler>I told him you and I split up.

301
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,030
<12-3,Chandler>他拖我去脱衣舞俱乐部  还有色情酒吧
<12-3,Chandler>So then he took me to these strip clubs and sleazy bars.

302
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:53,130
<12-3,Chandler>我不肯把婚戒交给他
<12-3,Chandler>When I wouldn't give him my wedding ring,

303
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:55,390
<12-3,Chandler>他就用汽水罐打小鸟
<12-3,Chandler>he threw a soda can at a bird.

304
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:59,880
<12-4,Monica>过来  我可以用嘴巴呼吸
<12-4,Monica>Come here. I can breathe through my mouth.

305
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:03,870
<12-5,Chandler>-亲爱的  -你知道最糟糕的是什么吗
<12-5,Chandler>- Oh, sweetie.- You know what the worst part was?

306
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:06,330
<12-5,Chandler>我预见到了没有你的生活是什么样子
<12-5,Chandler>I got to see what my life would be like without you.

307
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:10,760
<12-5,Chandler>就像是《生活多美好》配上艳舞
<12-5,Chandler>It was like It's a Wonderful Life with lap dances.

308
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,020
<12-5,Chandler>请答应我  你永远不会离开我
<12-5,Chandler>Please promise me that you'll never leave me...

309
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,540
<12-5,Chandler>我们会一起变老
<12-5,Chandler>...that we'll grow old together,

310
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:20,320
<12-5,Chandler>相伴一生
<12-5,Chandler>and be with each other for the rest of our lives.

311
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:22,510
<12-6,Monica>我答应你
<12-6,Monica>I promise.

312
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:26,210
<12-6,Monica>说到相伴一生
<12-6,Monica>Speaking of together,

313
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:28,540
<12-6,Monica>我们今年一起寄节日贺卡吧
<12-6,Monica>how about we send out a holiday card this year?

314
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,320
<12-7,Chandler>我不知道我们是不是到那个地步了
<12-7,Chandler>I don't know if we're there yet.

315
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:38,600
<13-1,Rachel>我想订披萨  我能问你一个问题吗
<13-1,Rachel>I'd like to order a pizza. Can I ask you a question?

316
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:41,230
<13-1,Rachel>今晚是那个金发帅哥外送吗
<13-1,Rachel>Is the cute blond guy delivering tonight?

317
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,450
<13-1,Rachel>长得又酷又时髦的那个
<13-1,Rachel>Very "Abercrombie & Fitch."

<13-2,Joey>-我再打给你  -你在跟谁打电话
<13-2,Joey>- I'll call you back. - Who was that?

319
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,630
<13-3,Rachel>我在订披萨
<13-3,Rachel>It's just the pizza place.

320
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,980
<13-4,Joey>你竟然挂掉了订披萨的电话
<13-4,Joey>You hung up on the pizza place?

321
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,700
<13-4,Joey>我可不会挂掉你朋友的电话
<13-4,Joey>I don't hang up on your friends.

322
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:57,290
<13-5,Rachel>抱歉  今天我过得不顺心
<13-5,Rachel>Sorry, honey, I'm just having a rough day.

323
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:58,540
<13-6,Joey>怎么了
<13-6,Joey>What's wrong?

324
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:01,420
<13-7,Rachel>你不会想听的
<13-7,Rachel>You don't want to hear about it.

325
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:03,080
<13-8,Joey>不然我为什么要问
<13-8,Joey>Then why did I ask?

326
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,830
<13-9,Rachel>这真的很丢脸
<13-9,Rachel>Okay, this is really embarrassing,

327
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:08,180
<13-9,Rachel>但最近自从我怀孕后
<13-9,Rachel>but lately, with this whole pregnancy thing...

328
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,960
<13-9,Rachel>我发现自己...
<13-9,Rachel>...I'm just finding myself...

329
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:13,540
<13-9,Rachel>我该怎么说呢
<13-9,Rachel>How do I put this?

330
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:17,190
<13-9,Rachel>春情大发
<13-9,Rachel>Erotically charged.

331
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,100
<13-10,Joey>那是"性饥渴"的学名吗
<13-10,Joey>Is that college talk for "horny"?

332
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,460
<13-11,Rachel>对  我心中充满了欲望
<13-11,Rachel>Yeah. I have all of these feelings,

333
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,240
<13-11,Rachel>但却不知道该怎么处理
<13-11,Rachel>and I don't know what to do about them.

334
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,950
<13-11,Rachel>我没办法像正常人去约会
<13-11,Rachel>I can't date like a normal person,

335
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:32,180
<13-11,Rachel>这没关系  因为我不需要男朋友
<13-11,Rachel>which is fine because I don't need a relationship.

336
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:36,450
<13-11,Rachel>我只想要一夜情  只有性爱就好
<13-11,Rachel>All I really want is one great night! Just sex.

337
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:39,440
<13-11,Rachel>没有牵绊  不谈恋爱
<13-11,Rachel>No strings attached. No relationship.

338
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,680
<13-11,Rachel>就跟我喜欢的人在一起
<13-11,Rachel>With someone I feel comfortable with,

339
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,100
<13-11,Rachel>他懂得掌握分寸
<13-11,Rachel>and who knows what he's doing.

340
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,170
<13-11,Rachel>只要共度一夜春宵
<13-11,Rachel>For just one great night.

341
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:49,500
<13-11,Rachel>真的就那么难...
<13-11,Rachel>I mean, is that really so hard...

342
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,700
<13-11,Rachel>找到吗
<13-11,Rachel>...to find?

343
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,160
<13-11,Rachel>你今天过得如何
<13-11,Rachel>So how was your day?

344
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:04,200
<13-12,Joey>很好  我看见一只超大的鸽子
<13-12,Joey>Good. I saw a pretty big pigeon.

345
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:13,020
<13-13,Rachel>我还得早起  都快七点了
<13-13,Rachel>Well, I gotta get up early, and it's almost 7:00.

346
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,600
<13-14,Joey>-我得回房了  -晚安
<13-14,Joey>- I gotta go to my room. - Good night!

347
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,920
<13-16,Joey>晚安
<13-16,Joey>Good night!

348
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,970
<13-18,Rachel>-我不能那么做  -我没有要你那么做
<13-18,Rachel>- I can't do it! - I didn't ask you to do it!

349
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:24,320
<13-20,Rachel>-你是瑞秋  -你是乔伊
<13-20,Rachel>- You're Rachel! - You're Joey!

<13-21,Joey>-你是我的朋友  -你也是我的朋友
<13-21,Joey>- You're my friend! - Right back at you.

351
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:30,890
<13-23,Joey>对  而且那样是不对的  怪异又恶劣
<13-23,Joey>Yeah. Plus, it would be wrong, and weird and bad!

352
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:33,500
<13-24,Rachel>太恶劣了  但我不知道你在说什么
<13-24,Rachel>So bad! But I don't know what you're talking about.

353
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,170
<13-24,Rachel>-因为我没要求你做什么事  -我知道
<13-24,Rachel>- Because I didn't ask you to do anything! - I know!

354
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:47,310
<13-26,Joey>-你想做吗  -不想
<13-26,Joey>- You wanna do it? - No!

355
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,470
<13-28,Joey>我也不想  我只是在考验你
<13-28,Joey>Me neither. I'm just testing you!

356
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:51,170
<13-29,Rachel>那这件事就到此为止了
