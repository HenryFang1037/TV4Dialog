57
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,940
<2-13,Chandler>我以为她还会继续和他住在一起
<2-13,Chandler>...I just assumed she'd still be living with him.

58
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:56,810
<2-14,Phoebe>你怎么会觉得她和乔伊住得很开心
<2-14,Phoebe>Why do you think she's having so much fun living with Joey?

00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:59,280
<2-15,Chandler>没什么  除了她
<2-15,Chandler>No reason, except she...

60
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,240
<2-15,Chandler>这么和我说过
<2-15,Chandler>...told me.

61
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:04,150
<2-16,Phoebe>真的  她说她不要和我住
<2-16,Phoebe>Really? She said she didn't want to live with me?

00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:07,080
<2-17,Chandler>没有  她没有这么说
<2-17,Chandler>No. No, she didn't say that.

63
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:09,980
<2-17,Chandler>你该和莫妮卡聊聊了
<2-17,Chandler>I think you should talk to Monica now.

<2-18,Monica>菲比  别担心  我确定她想和你住的
<2-18,Monica>Phoebe, don't worry. I'm sure she wants to live with you.

00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,950
<2-19,Phoebe>你确定  你很肯定
<2-19,Phoebe>You're sure? You're absolutely sure?

66
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:18,530
<2-20,Monica>不  我打赌她大概会
<2-20,Monica>No, but I'll bet she probably does.

67
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:19,860
<2-21,Phoebe>大概会
<2-21,Phoebe>Oh, probably?

68
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,430
<2-21,Phoebe>我可不喜欢这个词
<2-21,Phoebe>I don't like that word.

69
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,300
<2-21,Phoebe>我知道"大概"什么意思  对
<2-21,Phoebe>I know what "Probably" really means. Yeah, yeah.

<2-21,Phoebe>"你妈大概不会自杀"
<2-21,Phoebe>"Oh, your mom probably won't kill herself."

<2-21,Phoebe>我很抱歉  但我不会把所有希望
<2-21,Phoebe>I'm sorry, but I'm not hanging all my hopes...

72
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:36,430
<2-21,Phoebe>都寄于瑞秋"大概"会想和我住上
<2-21,Phoebe>...of Rachel and I living together on "Probably."

73
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:39,270
<2-21,Phoebe>你得自己照顾自己
<2-21,Phoebe>You gotta take care of yourself in this world.

74
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,780
<2-21,Phoebe>历史教训完全没用
<2-21,Phoebe>History teaches us nothing.

75
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:47,110
<2-22,Chandler>"宾"现在就那么怪了吧
<2-22,Chandler>"Bing" doesn't seem so weird now, does it?

<4-2,Monica>I'm sorry. But not that sorry,

81
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,220
<4-2,Monica>因为你不用和他生活
<4-2,Monica>because you don't have to live with it.

<4-4,Chandler>这是因为墨西哥卷的玩笑吗
<4-4,Chandler>Is this because of the burrito thing?

87
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:43,140
<4-6,Chandler>--你得给他钱  -给钱  我就开了个玩笑
<4-6,Chandler>- You need to give him money. - Give him money? It was a joke!

88

<6-2,Chandler>- How do you know so much about this? - I don't know.

<6-4,Chandler>理查德就这么做  是吧
<6-4,Chandler>Richard used to do it, didn't he?

132
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,740
<6-5,Monica>我们本来都应该开始喝汤了
<6-5,Monica>We'd be eating our soup right now.

133
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,080
<6-6,Chandler>小胡子混蛋
<6-6,Chandler>Mustached bastard.

134

<6-8,Chandler>打扰一下
<6-8,Chandler>Excuse me.

137

<7-1,Rachel>我们赶时间  可不可以
<7-1,Rachel>We're in a bit of a hurry. Can we...?

138
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,270
<7-2,Phoebe>所以你喜欢鼓
<7-2,Phoebe>So you like the drums.

139
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:54,420
<7-2,Phoebe>太棒了
<7-2,Phoebe>That's great.

140
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:58,550
<7-2,Phoebe>我还担心鼓会让你的
<7-2,Phoebe>You know, I was worried that they would create maybe...

141
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,780
<7-2,Phoebe>生存环境变得无法忍受
<7-2,Phoebe>...an unbearable living situation.

142
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,050
<7-2,Phoebe>但是显然没有  太好了
<7-2,Phoebe>But, okay, well, apparently not. So, yay!

143

149
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,470
<8-2,Chandler>用硬币绝对没让这事容易点
<8-2,Chandler>Definitely not easier with coins.

150
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,150
<8-3,Joey>-谢谢  -谢谢
<8-3,Joey>- Thank you. - Thank you.

<8-5,Joey>Here. Now I only owe you 49.50.

153
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:47,290
<8-6,Chandler>菲比
<8-6,Chandler>Hey, Pheebs...

154
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,770
<8-7,Phoebe>如果你想送乔伊一份
<8-7,Phoebe>...if you want to get Joey a Christmas present

155
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:51,290
<8-8,Chandler>惊扰四邻的圣诞礼物
<8-8,Chandler>that disrupts the entire building...

156
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:53,550
<8-8,Chandler>为什么不给他买更微妙一点的礼物呢
<8-8,Chandler>...why not get him something more subtle...

157
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:54,930
<8-8,Chandler>比如落锤粉碎机之类的
<8-8,Chandler>...like a wrecking ball...

158
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:58,760
<8-8,Chandler>或是可以再走廊上散播的天花病毒
<8-8,Chandler>...or a vial of smallpox to release in the hallway?

159
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,870
<8-9,Monica>不只是鼓的声音  每5分钟
<8-9,Monica>It's not just the drum noise. Every five minutes...

160
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,800
<8-9,Monica>乔伊把鼓棒丢到空中
<8-9,Monica>...Joey throws his sticks in the air...

161
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:07,540
<8-9,Monica>然后我就会听到"我的眼睛  我的眼睛"
<8-9,Monica>...and I have to hear: "Oh, my eye! Oh, God, my eye!"

162
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:10,340
<8-9,Monica>-烦死人了  -谢谢你
<8-9,Monica>- I mean, it is so annoying. - Yes, thank you.

163
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,980
<8-10,Phoebe>你看  这才是
<8-10,Phoebe>You see, this is

164
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:15,140
<8-10,Phoebe>普通人对于鼓的反应好吗
<8-10,Phoebe>how normal people are supposed to react to drums.

165
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:19,080
<8-11,Monica>菲比  你送乔伊鼓是为了烦瑞秋
<8-11,Monica>Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel...

166
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,820
<8-11,Monica>让她不想和乔伊住
<8-11,Monica>...so she wouldn't want to live there anymore?

167
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:23,990
<8-12,Phoebe>有一点吧
<8-12,Phoebe>Maybe on some level.

168
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,570
<8-12,Phoebe>乔伊  你知道
<8-12,Phoebe>Joey, you know that

169
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:35,700
<9-1,Rachel>你知道你不用丢鼓棒的
<9-1,Rachel>you could just not throw the sticks up in the air.

170
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,900
<9-2,Joey>不扔怎么能算是摇滚乐呢
<9-2,Joey>What is rock 'r roll about that?

171
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:43,080
<9-3,Phoebe>乔伊  送你另一个礼物
<9-3,Phoebe>Hey, Joey, I got you another present.

172
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,850
<9-4,Joey>等一下   先不要告诉我是什么
<9-4,Joey>Hold it! Before you tell me what it is...

173
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,880
<9-4,Joey>是什么
<9-4,Joey>Okay, what is it?

174
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,320
<9-5,Phoebe>是
<9-5,Phoebe>It's a...

175
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:54,860
<9-5,Phoebe>毒蜘蛛
<9-5,Phoebe>...tarantula!

176
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:04,130
<9-5,Phoebe>瑞秋  抱歉  我在想什么
<9-5,Phoebe>God, Rachel, I'm sorry. What was I thinking...

177
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,460
<9-5,Phoebe>送乔伊这么一个恶心可怕的蜘蛛
<9-5,Phoebe>...giving Joey this big, gross, scary spider...

178
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,230
<9-5,Phoebe>还用这么松的笼子
<9-5,Phoebe>...in such a poorly constructed cage?

179
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,540
<9-6,Rachel>你在说什么 我喜欢蜘蛛
<9-6,Rachel>What are you talking about? I love them.

180
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:18,260
<9-6,Rachel>我小时候就有一只
<9-6,Rachel>I had a tarantula when I was a kid.

181
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:20,650
<9-6,Rachel>后来我的猫咪吃掉了它
<9-6,Rachel>But it died because my cat ate it.

182
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,550
<9-6,Rachel>之后我的猫也死了
<9-6,Rachel>And then my cat died.

183
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,710
<9-6,Rachel>乔伊  这不是很酷吗
<9-6,Rachel>But, Joey, isn't this cool?

184
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,760
<9-7,Joey>它在我身上吗  我觉得它在我身上
<9-7,Joey>Is it on me? I feel like it's on me. I got...

185
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:33,250
<9-8,Rachel>不是很可爱吗
<9-8,Rachel>Oh, isn't that adorable?

186
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,560
<9-8,Rachel>乔伊怕蜘蛛
<9-8,Rachel>Joey is afraid of the tarantula.

187
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,170
<9-9,Phoebe>他真可爱
<9-9,Phoebe>He's so adorable.

188
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,560
<9-9,Phoebe>天啊  他太有意思了
<9-9,Phoebe>God, he's just so much fun.

189
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:42,470
<9-9,Phoebe>乔伊最好了  我很高兴你在这住得开心
<9-9,Phoebe>Joey's the best. I'm glad you're having so much fun here.

190
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:43,900
<9-10,Rachel>慢着
<9-10,Rachel>Wait a minute.

191
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,300
<9-10,Rachel>怎么了
<9-10,Rachel>What's the matter?

192
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,630
<9-11,Phoebe>我们公寓可以住了
<9-11,Phoebe>Our apartment is ready.

193
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,420
<9-12,Rachel>那你为什么会生气呢
<9-12,Rachel>And that makes you angry because...?

194
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,240
<9-13,Phoebe>因为你更喜欢和乔伊住
<9-13,Phoebe>Because you'd rather live here with Joey.

195
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:58,180
<9-14,Rachel>-你怎么会这么想  -莫妮卡和钱德勒
<9-14,Rachel>- Where did you get that? - Monica and Chandler...

196
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,760
<9-15,Phoebe>说你在这里很开心

197
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,750
<9-15,Phoebe>很明显架子鼓
<9-15,Phoebe>...and apparently no amount of drums

198
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,660
<9-15,Phoebe>和毒蜘蛛也不会改变你的想法
<9-15,Phoebe>or tarantula is gonna change that.

199
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,970
<9-17,Phoebe>菲比  你送乔伊这些东西
<9-17,Phoebe>Phoebe, did you get all this stuff for Joey...

200
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:12,300
<9-18,Rachel>是让我不想住在这里
<9-18,Rachel>...to try and drive me out of the apartment?

201
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,900
<9-18,Rachel>你还不如送他一条鱼
<9-18,Rachel>You might as well have just gotten him a fish.

202
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,440
<9-18,Rachel>你知道我有多怕鱼
<9-18,Rachel>You know how fish freak me out.

270
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:38,160

303
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:29,610

00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:45,990
<11-48,Ross>是讲述油灯节故事的时候了
<11-48,Ross>...for the story of Hanukkah.

310
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:48,330
<11-48,Ross>很多年以前
<11-48,Ross>Years and years ago...

311
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:52,330
<11-49,Joey>有一群人  叫做玛加伯人
<11-49,Joey>...there were these people called the Maccabees!

312
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:55,000
<11-49,Joey>圣诞快乐
<11-49,Joey>Merry Christmas!

313
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:08,310
<12-1,Rachel>看看这地方
<12-1,Rachel>Oh, wow, look at this place!

314
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,680
<12-2,Phoebe>这太糟糕了
<12-2,Phoebe>Oh, this is terrible.

315
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:14,320
<12-2,Phoebe>他们做了太多改变
<12-2,Phoebe>They've made so many changes...

316
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:17,890
<12-2,Phoebe>我都感觉不到我祖母的存在了
<12-2,Phoebe>...I can't even feel my grandmother's presence anymore.

317
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,590
<12-2,Phoebe>新烛台
<12-2,Phoebe>Oh, new sconces!

318
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,330
<12-4,Phoebe>-天啊  -怎么了
<12-4,Phoebe>- Oh, my God! - What?

319
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,360
<12-5,Rachel>记得你告诉我
<12-5,Rachel>Okay, remember how you told me

320
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,760
<12-5,Rachel>你祖母砌了一道墙
<12-5,Rachel>that your grandmother put up that wall...

321
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,790
<12-5,Rachel>-把这间房隔成两个卧室吗  -是吧
<12-5,Rachel>- ...to make that into two bedrooms? - Yeah.

322
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:32,650
<12-7,Rachel>之后你害怕房东会发现
<12-7,Rachel>And then you are afraid that the landlord might find out...

323
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:34,970
<12-7,Rachel>-然后把墙推倒了  -是吗
<12-7,Rachel>- ...and then tear it down? - Yeah?

324
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:38,410
<12-9,Rachel>你知道我要说什么吗
<12-9,Rachel>Do you really not know where I'm going with this?

325
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,280
<12-9,Rachel>墙不见了  变成一个房间了
<12-9,Rachel>It left. It's one huge room.

326
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,550
<12-10,Phoebe>不
<12-10,Phoebe>Oh, no!

327
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,720
<12-11,Rachel>看见了吧
<12-11,Rachel>See?

328
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,600
<12-12,Phoebe>我们大概要把墙重新砌起来
<12-12,Phoebe>I guess we'll just have to put the wall back up.

329
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:57,100
<12-13,Rachel>-不行  因为有天窗了  -还有天窗
<12-13,Rachel>- You can't, because of the new skylight. - There's a skylight?

330
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:03,240
<12-14,Phoebe>我怎么办  找个其他地方住吗
<12-14,Phoebe>So, what should we do? Should we start looking for a new place?

331
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:08,250
<12-15,Rachel>我能感觉到
<12-15,Rachel>You know, I'm sensing...

332
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:12,390
<12-16,Phoebe>我祖母不高兴看见这些改变
<12-16,Phoebe>...that my grandmother would not be comfortable with that.

333
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,380
<12-16,Phoebe>是吗
<12-16,Phoebe>Oh, yeah?

334
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:18,250
<12-17,Rachel>又能感觉到她了是吧
<12-17,Rachel>Starting to feel her again there, are we?

335
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:20,890
<12-18,Phoebe>-一点点  -是吧
<12-18,Phoebe>- A little bit. Yeah. - Yeah.

336
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,620
<12-19,Rachel>菲比  也许你祖母在说
<12-19,Rachel>Pheebs, is your grandmother

337
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:26,070
<12-19,Rachel>你应该一个人在这住
<12-19,Rachel>maybe saying that you should live here alone?

338
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:28,460
<12-20,Phoebe>你也听到了  你有天赋啊
<12-20,Phoebe>You heard it too? You have the gift.

339
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:32,260
<12-20,Phoebe>菲比  没事的
<12-20,Phoebe>Phoebe, it's okay.

340
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,430
<12-21,Rachel>我喜欢和乔伊住
<12-21,Rachel>I like living with Joey.

341
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,140
<12-22,Phoebe>-你确定吗  -拜托  我讨厌打包
<12-22,Phoebe>- Are you sure? - Please. I hate packing...

342
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,750
<12-23,Rachel>那里离公司比较近
<12-23,Rachel>...it's closer to work.

343
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,920
<12-23,Rachel>我们在一起很开心
<12-23,Rachel>And we do have fun.

344
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:45,610
<12-23,Rachel>虽然我真的会想念和你住在一起的日子
<12-23,Rachel>Although, I'm really gonna miss living with you.

345
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,420
<12-24,Phoebe>-我也是  -我知道
<12-24,Phoebe>- Oh, me too. - I know.

346
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,420
<12-25,Rachel>等一下  你有没有听到
<12-25,Rachel>Oh, wait. Did you hear that?

347
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:54,150
<12-25,Rachel>我听到你祖母说话
<12-25,Rachel>Listen. I'm getting something from your grandmother.

348
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:57,860
<12-25,Rachel>她说既然你要一个人住这里
<12-25,Rachel>She said that since you get to keep the one-bedroom apartment...

349
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:01,430
<12-25,Rachel>你该把那紫色椅子给瑞秋
<12-25,Rachel>...you should give Rachel the purple chair.

350
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:06,270
<12-26,Phoebe>我没有听到
<12-26,Phoebe>No, I do not hear that.

351
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:10,670
<13-1,Ross>奇迹在于那一点点的油
<13-1,Ross>And the miracle was that that little bit of oil...

352
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,720
<13-1,Ross>应该只够烧一天的  却烧了
<13-1,Ross>...that should have lasted just one day, burned for...

353
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,850
<13-2,Ben>-整整八天  -对
<13-2,Ben>- Eight whole days. - That's right.

354
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:20,990
<13-3,Ross>所以我们才要庆祝油灯节  结束
<13-3,Ross>And that's why we celebrate Hanukkah today. The end.

355
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,130
<13-4,Ben>-很好  -对
<13-4,Ben>- Awesome. - Yeah.

356
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,550
<13-6,Chandler>我最喜欢的部份
<13-6,Chandler>My favorite part...

357
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:29,190
<13-6,Chandler>是超人救出全埃及的犹太人
<13-6,Chandler>...was when Superman flew all the Jews out of Egypt.

358
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:37,040
<13-7,Ross>犰狳不是那么喜欢那部份
<13-7,Ross>The armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part.

359
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,270
<13-7,Ross>本  是时候
<13-7,Ross>Okay, Ben, it's time to light...
