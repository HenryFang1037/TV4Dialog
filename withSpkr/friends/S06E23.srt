00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:05,370
<1-1,Chandler>菲比  帮我挑适合莫妮卡的订婚戒指好吗
<1-1,Chandler>Pheebs, would you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica?

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,080
<1-1,Chandler>我都挑花眼了  好难挑喔
<1-1,Chandler>l can't figure this out. It’s so hard!

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,020
<1-1,Chandler>我要选蒂芬尼切割法还是...
<1-1,Chandler>Should l get her a Tiffany cut

<1-1,Chandler>or a princess cut or a...?

5
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:12,240
<1-1,Chandler>被纸割法
<1-1,Chandler>Paper cut!

6
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:15,480
<1-2,Phoebe>你有告诉其他人吗
<1-2,Phoebe>Have you told anyone else?

7
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:16,760
<1-3,Chandler>没有  我没告诉其他人
<1-3,Chandler>No, I dont want to tell anybody else

8
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,610
<1-3,Chandler>因为我怕被莫妮卡发现
<1-3,Chandler>because I don’t want Monica to find out.

9
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:19,900
<1-4,Phoebe>可是你告诉我了
<1-4,Phoebe>You told me.

10
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:22,470
<1-5,Chandler>因为我信任你  你是我的死党之一
<1-5,Chandler>Because l trust you, you’re one of my best friends

11
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:25,540
<1-5,Chandler>而且你在我看戒指目录时闯进来
<1-5,Chandler>and you saw me looking at ring brochures.

12
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,980
<1-6,Phoebe>进房不敲门  再次大有斩获
<1-6,Phoebe>Once again, not knocking pays off.

13
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,910
<1-6,Phoebe>-当时你不是在蹲马桶就更好了  -我有同感
<1-6,Phoebe>- l wish you hadn't been on the toilet. - Me too.

00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,340
<1-8,Joey>-钱德勒  要不要去喝咖啡  -好啊  走吧
<1-8,Joey>- So Chandler, wanna go to the coffeehouse? - Oh, all right.

<1-10,Phoebe>去咖啡馆吧
<1-10,Phoebe>Yeah, coffee house.

16

<1-11,Chandler>太好了  我们正想找你们下去呢
<1-11,Chandler>Oh perfect, we were just gonna see if you wanted to go.

<1-13,Ross>不要  我们要去别家
<1-13,Ross>Oh well, we don’t because we got the other pl-place.

18
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:50,790
<1-15,Ross>真没礼貌
<1-15,Ross>How rude.

19
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:52,720
<1-16,Joey>抱歉  你要吃吗
<1-16,Joey>Oh, I'm sorry. You wanna bite?

31
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,560
<2-1,Phoebe>你和保罗交往得怎样
<2-1,Phoebe>So how are things going with Paul?

32
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:37,400
<2-1,Phoebe>很好
<2-1,Phoebe>Good.

33
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:40,180
<2-2,Rachel>只不过他很内敛
<2-2,Rachel>Although, you know, he's a private guy.

34
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,890
<2-2,Rachel>真想让他稍微敞开心胸  分享心情
<2-2,Rachel>Y’know, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.

35
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,200
<2-2,Rachel>简单
<2-2,Rachel>That's easy.

36
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,720
<2-3,Phoebe>你把想象成打不开的罐子就对了
<2-3,Phoebe>You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that won't open.

37
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,380
<2-4,Rachel>所以你的意思是
<2-4,Rachel>So what are you saying;

38
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:54,830
<2-4,Rachel>我应该拿他去冲热水  然后抓他的头撞桌子吗
<2-4,Rachel>l should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?

39
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:59,510
<2-5,Phoebe>不是  那是逼问真相的手法
<2-5,Phoebe>No that's what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.

40
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,100
<2-6,Paul>-宝贝  我来啦  -你来啦

47
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,550

49
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:36,870
<2-26,Phoebe>是啊  很怪吧
<2-26,Phoebe>Yeah! That was so weird, huh?

50
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:39,610
<2-27,Ross>菲比  为什么要这样
<2-27,Ross>Phoebe, why’d you do it?

51
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,920
<2-28,Phoebe>不是我  是钱德勒
<2-28,Phoebe>l didn't do it. lt was Chandler.

52
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,820
<2-29,Ross>他...他在生你们的气
<2-29,Ross>He's mad at you.

53
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:49,980
<2-30,Phoebe>-为什么  -拜托  你明知故问
<2-30,Phoebe>- What? Why? - Oh, please. l think you know why.

54
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,590
<2-31,Ross>我想不起来了
<2-31,Ross>l can't think of anything.

<2-32,Phoebe>罗斯  你是古生物学家  再往深处探究
<2-32,Phoebe>Come on. You're a paleontologist. Just dig a little deeper.

56
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:01,120

<2-36,Phoebe>他生气就直说嘛  干嘛隐瞒情绪
<2-36,Phoebe>lf he's angry, he really shouldn’t just cover it up.

61
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,380
<2-37,Ross>真希望他能直接告诉我
<2-37,Ross>l wish he'd just tell me the truth.

62
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:19,560
<2-38,Phoebe>想知道真相的话  你可以抓他去冲热水
<2-38,Phoebe>Oh, if that's what you want, then you should run him under hot water

63

<2-38,Phoebe>再抓他的头撞桌子
<2-38,Phoebe>and bang his head against the table.

125
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:48,280
<4-2,Phoebe>送点不一样的
<4-2,Phoebe>Maybe you do something different.

126
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,580
<4-2,Phoebe>例如订婚手镯
<4-2,Phoebe>You know? Maybe you get her an engagement bracelet,

00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,230
<4-2,Phoebe>或是订婚皇冠

<5-7,Ross>送他尼克斯队其他比赛的门票

<6-4,Monica>要让一个男人闭嘴只有两招
<6-4,Monica>l only know of two ways to shut a man up.

188
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,270
<6-4,Monica>其中一招是性爱

<6-5,Rachel>-另一个是什么  -不知道
<6-5,Rachel>- What's the other? - I don’t know,

190
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,650

<6-6,Monica>I've never had to use the other one.

191
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:09,410
<6-6,Monica>只是说做爱的时候  他就不会讲话了
<6-6,Monica>I'm just saying, if we're having sex, he's not talking.

192
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:11,850
<6-7,Rachel>没错  每次都是你在出声
<6-7,Rachel>That's right. You're the talker.

193
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:17,350
<6-7,Rachel>总之这个主意很棒

261
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,270
<10-7,Ross>那我们也不跟他说了
<10-7,Ross>well maybe we don't talk to him at all!

<11-10,Paul>当年那个小家伙上哪了呢
<11-10,Paul>Whatever happened to that little dude?

<11-11,Rachel>我不行了  我听不下去了
<11-11,Rachel>l can't! l cannot listen to any more of this!

287
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:33,670
<11-11,Rachel>你知道谁才会想听这些话吗  心理医师
<11-11,Rachel>Y’know, the only person who would want to listen to this is a mental health professional!

288
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:36,200
<11-11,Rachel>那还是因为他们一小时赚100块
<11-11,Rachel>That's only because they get $ 100 an hour!

289
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:38,790
<11-11,Rachel>你知道我听到现在可以赚多少吗

292
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,710
<11-11,Rachel>在你说个不停的时候
<11-11,Rachel>While you were talking!

293
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:48,810
<11-12,Paul>你居然想扼杀我的情绪  14个小时前
<11-12,Paul>l can't believe you're trying to stifle me when 14 hours ago...

294
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:52,540
<11-12,Paul>我们才发现  那就是我妈的目的
<11-12,Paul>we figured out that's what my mother was trying to do to me!

295
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,360
<11-12,Paul>对不起
<11-12,Paul>l'm sorry.

<11-13,Rachel>我不是想扼杀你的情绪
<11-13,Rachel>l don't mean.... l didn't mean to stifle you.

297
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:02,860
<11-13,Rachel>我只是有点受不了
<11-13,Rachel>This is all just a little overwhelming.

298
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:07,230
<11-14,Paul>瑞秋  对不起
<11-14,Paul>Oh Rachel, l'm so sorry.

299
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:09,830
<11-14,Paul>我不是故意的
<11-14,Paul>l didn't mean to overwhelm you.

300
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:12,940
<11-14,Paul>只不过情绪一发泄
<11-14,Paul>lt's just that when those gates open...

301
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:17,070
<11-14,Paul>就会...不可收拾
<11-14,Paul>...it's hard to close them.

302
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,080
<11-14,Paul>不过现在没事了  真的
<11-14,Paul>But they are closed now. Believe me.

303
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:26,050
<11-15,Rachel>我很高兴你跟我分享你的心情
<11-15,Rachel>l'm so glad. l'm so glad you shared.

00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,920
<11-15,Rachel>那我们要不要...
<11-15,Rachel>So what do you say we....

306
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,390
<11-16,Paul>我求之不得
<11-16,Paul>l'd like that.

307
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:52,740
<12-1,Paul>那真是...太棒了
<12-1,Paul>That was so good!

308
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,760
<13-1,Phoebe>我居然听你的话
<13-1,Phoebe>I can't believe I let you talk me

309
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,260
<13-2,Chandler>买下这枚像是从口香糖贩卖机弄来的戒指
<13-2,Chandler>into buying this stupid gumball machine looking ring!

310
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:13,780
<13-3,Phoebe>它才不像从口香糖贩卖机弄来呢
<13-3,Phoebe>It’s not a stupid gumball machine looking ring!

311
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,030
<13-3,Phoebe>它是枚很漂亮的戒指
<13-3,Phoebe>lt's a beautiful ring!

312
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:16,740
<13-3,Phoebe>它才不漂亮
<13-3,Phoebe>No, it's not.

313
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:18,140
<13-4,Chandler>另一枚戒指
<13-4,Chandler>When l looked at the other ring,

314
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:20,600
<13-4,Chandler>我能想象到她收到时的表情
<13-4,Chandler>l could see Monica's face when I gave it to her, y’know?

315
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,530
<13-4,Chandler>她点头答应的模样
<13-4,Chandler>...and l could see her saying yes.

316
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:24,920
<13-4,Chandler>而这枚戒指怎么看都只是戒指
<13-4,Chandler>When I look at this ring, all I see is a ring!

317
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,360
<13-4,Chandler>只有我超近距离看
<13-4,Chandler>Unless l look at it really closely,

318
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:29,250
<13-4,Chandler>那才能看到我眼睛的摸样
<13-4,Chandler>and then l can see my own eye.

319
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:37,380
<13-4,Chandler>听着  这是我这辈子最重要的一件事
<13-4,Chandler>Look, this is the most important thing I'm gonna do in my life.

320
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,990
<13-4,Chandler>我想做到最完美
<13-4,Chandler>I wanna make sure it's perfect.

321
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,760
<13-5,Phoebe>我们或许能把那枚戒指要回来
<13-5,Phoebe>Maybe we could get the other ring back.

322
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,510
<13-5,Phoebe>我偷听到那个人跟售货员说
<13-5,Phoebe>'Cause I heard the guy tell the jeweler

323
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:45,930
<13-5,Phoebe>他准备求婚的地方
<13-5,Phoebe>where he was going to propose.

324
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:48,470
<13-5,Phoebe>或许我们可以说服他交换什么的
<13-5,Phoebe>So maybe we can get him to trade rings or something.

325
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:49,840
<13-6,Chandler>我不能这么做
<13-6,Chandler>l can't do that.

326
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:53,460
<13-7,Phoebe>你总不能给莫妮卡那枚口香糖戒指吧
<13-7,Phoebe>You certainly can't give her that stupid gumball ring.

327
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:03,150
<14-1,Phoebe>就是他
<14-1,Phoebe>There he is.

328
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:05,000
<14-2,Chandler>好  他还没求婚
<14-2,Chandler>Okay and he hasn’t proposed yet

329
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,400
<14-2,Chandler>因为她手指上没有戴戒指
<14-2,Chandler>because she has no ring on her finger.

330
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:10,620
<14-3,Phoebe>你真行  之后我们应该去当侦探
<14-3,Phoebe>Wow, you're good! After this, we should solve crimes.

331
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,110
<14-4,Chandler>去请他过来
<14-4,Chandler>Okay. Go get him.
