<1-2,Phoebe>快看  太不可思议了
<1-2,Phoebe>Check it out, this is unbelievable!

2
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:10,720
<1-2,Phoebe>乔伊已经憋气将近四分钟啦
<1-2,Phoebe>Joey's been holding his breath for almost four minutes.

3
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,060
<1-3,Joey>伙计  你想闷死我啊
<1-3,Joey>Dude, You trying to kill me?

4
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:22,380
<1-4,Rachel>-菲比  问你件事  -什么事
<1-4,Rachel>- Pheebs, l want to ask you something. -Uh, what?

5
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,540
<1-6,Rachel>看在我要搬出去  而你又这么美丽...
<1-6,Rachel>Since l'm moving out, and you're so beautiful...

6
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:28,180
<1-7,Phoebe>我搬去跟你住如何
<1-7,Phoebe>...how about l move in with you?

7
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:31,340
<1-9,Phoebe>当然好啦  可是狄妮丝怎么办呢
<1-9,Phoebe>That would be great, but what do we do about Denise?

8
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:34,450
<1-11,Phoebe>-谁是狄妮丝  -我的室友啊
<1-11,Phoebe>- Who's Denise? - My roommate.

9
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:35,830
<1-12,Rachel>你有室友啊
<1-12,Rachel>You have a roommate?!

10
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:37,850
<1-13,Phoebe>是啊  人家叫狄妮丝  狄妮丝
<1-13,Phoebe>Yes, Denise. Denise!

11
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,000
<1-14,Joey>菲比  你干嘛这么神秘
<1-14,Joey>What is with the secrecy, Phoebe?

12
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,530
<1-14,Joey>这个狄妮丝如何  可爱吗
<1-14,Joey>What about Denise? She cute?

13
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:47,280
<1-15,Chandler>菲比  我不懂  我们怎么会不知道
<1-15,Chandler>Pheebs, I don't understand. How can you have a roommate

14
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,560
<1-15,Chandler>你有室友这件事呢
<1-15,Chandler>that none of us know about?

15
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,960
<1-16,Phoebe>或许是因为从来没人认真听我说话
<1-16,Phoebe>Maybe because you never listen to anything that l say.

16
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,200
<1-16,Phoebe>我一天到晚提起她  狄妮丝
<1-16,Phoebe>l talk about her all the time. Denise!

17
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:56,680
<1-17,Joey>瑞秋  我在想
<1-17,Joey>Hey, Rach, listen, I was think,

18
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,770
<1-17,Joey>我那里会多一个房间
<1-17,Joey>l'm gonna have an extra room over at my place.

19
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:00,880
<1-18,Rachel>-那倒是  -对啊  你何不搬来跟我住
<1-18,Rachel>- That's true. - Yes. Why don't you move in with me.

20
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:04,400
<1-19,Joey>我们可以谈心到天明  看看电影
<1-19,Joey>It’ll be great! We can like, stay up late talking, and watch movies.

21
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,820
<1-19,Joey>你知道赤裸星期四的规定吧
<1-19,Joey>You know about naked Thursdays, right?

22
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:11,630
<1-20,Rachel>是啊  我想  我还是自己找房子好了
<1-20,Rachel>Yeah, yeah. l think l'll find my own place.

23
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:16,130
<1-21,Chandler>我以为赤裸星期四是我们的专利呢
<1-21,Chandler>l thought naked Thursdays was just our thing, man.

35
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,920
<2-2,Ross>你没去注销你们的婚姻
<2-2,Ross>What did Rachel say when you told her

36
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,550
<2-3,Phoebe>瑞秋怎么说
<2-3,Phoebe>you were still married to her?

37
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,790
<2-4,Ross>那个啊
<2-4,Ross>Oh, that.

38
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,060
<2-4,Ross>她挺能接受的啊
<2-4,Ross>She took it really well.

39
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,030
<2-5,Phoebe>-你没说对吧  -没有
<2-5,Phoebe>- You didn't tell her, did you? - No.

40
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,090
<2-7,Phoebe>就知道你不会说  因为你还爱着她
<2-7,Phoebe>Of course not, because you're in love with her.

41
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,770
<2-7,Phoebe>我并不爱她
<2-7,Phoebe>l am not in love with her.

42
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,070
<2-8,Ross>她正为了搬家的事情伤心呢
<2-8,Ross>She was very upset about having to move out.

43
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,800
<2-8,Ross>所以我没告诉她这件事
<2-8,Ross>So I didn't tell her we were still married,

44
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,140
<2-8,Ross>免得她更不开心
<2-8,Ross>'cause she would only get more upset.

45
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,930
<2-8,Ross>我只是以朋友的身分安慰她
<2-8,Ross>I...l comforted her. As a friend.

46
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:23,310
<2-9,Phoebe>你是怎么个"安慰"法
<2-9,Phoebe>What do you mean "comforted her"?

47
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,580
<2-10,Ross>也没什么  我就抱了抱她
<2-10,Ross>Nothing. l just gave her a hug.

48
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:28,320
<2-11,Phoebe>拥抱正是爱情的经典表现
<2-11,Phoebe>Ah-uh, a classic sign of love, the hug.

49
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:30,890
<2-12,Ross>这也是友情的表现啊
<2-12,Ross>lt's also a sign of friendship.

50
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:33,460
<2-13,Phoebe>没错  但你不是那个意思  痴情男
<2-13,Phoebe>Yeah, not in your case, "Lovey Loverson."

51
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,100
<2-14,Ross>那只是个拥抱
<2-14,Ross>lt was a hug.

52
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,100
<2-15,Phoebe>好吧  那你告诉我
<2-15,Phoebe>All right, just tell me this,

53
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,300
<2-15,Phoebe>你有没有闻她的头发
<2-15,Phoebe>Did you, or did you not, smell her hair?

54
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,380
<2-16,Ross>闻她的头发
<2-16,Ross>Smell her hair?

55
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:43,730
<2-16,Ross>如果有呢
<2-16,Ross>What if l did?

56
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:47,660
<2-17,Phoebe>女性的费洛蒙有九成  是从头部散发
<2-17,Phoebe>Ninety percent of a woman's pheromones come out top of her head.

57
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,820
<2-17,Phoebe>所以女人都比较矮
<2-17,Phoebe>That's why women are shorter.

58
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:53,500
<2-17,Phoebe>好让男人在拥抱时爱上她们
<2-17,Phoebe>So that men will fall in love when they hug them.

59
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:56,640
<2-17,Phoebe>拜托  罗斯  你可是科学家啊
<2-17,Phoebe>Come on, Ross, you're a scientist.

60
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,200
<2-18,Ross>我是以朋友的身分去抱她
<2-18,Ross>l was hugging her as a friend.

61
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,780
<2-18,Ross>又不是我要把脸埋进她的头发里
<2-18,Ross>lt's not my fault, her hair got in my face.

62
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:05,880
<2-18,Ross>是她头发太多  而且有一股...
<2-18,Ross>She's got a lot of it, and it smells all...all...

63
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,640
<2-18,Ross>椰子香
<2-18,Ross>...coconutty.

64
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,200
<2-18,Ross>怎样
<2-18,Ross>What?

65
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,240
<2-18,Ross>那并不代表我对瑞秋有感觉
<2-18,Ross>lt doesn't mean l have feelings for Rachel.

66
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,590
<2-18,Ross>或许让我有感觉的是椰子
<2-18,Ross>Maybe it means l have feelings for coconuts.

67
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:20,580
<2-19,Phoebe>随你怎么说  但你要小心  知道吗
<2-19,Phoebe>Okay, whatever you say. But just be careful, all right?

68
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,160
<2-19,Phoebe>瑞秋的想法和你不同
<2-19,Phoebe>Rachel's not in the same place you are.

69
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,160
<2-20,Ross>好吧  如果这个心情是指爱情
<2-20,Ross>Okay, if the place you're referring to is being in love...

70
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,320
<2-20,Ross>那她的想法和我的一样
<2-20,Ross>...she is in the same place as me,

71
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,940
<2-20,Ross>因为我完全没想法
<2-20,Ross>because l am not in that place.

72
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,900
<2-21,Phoebe>好吧  我没听懂
<2-21,Phoebe>Okay, l didn't understand that.

73
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:35,550
<2-21,Phoebe>不过或许是
<2-21,Phoebe>But you know maybe that's

74
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:38,030
<2-21,Phoebe>因为你讲的是爱的秘语
<2-21,Phoebe>because you were speaking the secret language of love.

75
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:46,280
<3-1,Joey>-伙计  刚才有你的电话  -谁呀
<3-1,Joey>-Dude, some guy just called for you. - Who was it?

76
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,350
<3-2,Chandler>不知道
<3-2,Chandler>l don't know.

77
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:50,150
<3-3,Joey>你怎么不谢我帮你留言  什么人啊
<3-3,Joey>How about "Thanks for taking the message"? Jeez!

78
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,290
<3-4,Monica>听着  等你搬进来后
<3-4,Monica>Hey, listen. You know when you move in...

79
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:55,680
<3-4,Monica>瑞秋的房间就空出来了
<3-4,Monica>...Rachel's room will be empty.

80
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,570
<3-4,Monica>-你想谈谈要怎么利用吗  -当然
<3-4,Monica>- You wanna talk about what to do with it. - Sure.

81
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:01,360
<3-6,Monica>好  我在想我们应该弄个漂亮的客房
<3-6,Monica>Okay, l was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right?

82
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,930
<3-6,Monica>有红木雪橇床
<3-6,Monica>...with a mahogany sleigh bed

83
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:05,620
<3-6,Monica>床头桌上永远插着鲜花
<3-6,Monica>and bedside tables with fresh flowers all the time.

84
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,310
<3-6,Monica>我们可以弄张折叠式的椅子  上面放留言卡
<3-6,Monica>And we can have a roll-top desk with that little comment cards

85
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:10,650
<3-6,Monica>好让客人留言  说他们有多喜欢住在这里
<3-6,Monica>so people could tell us how much they love staying here.

86
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,580
<3-6,Monica>不管怎样  我还没有想太多
<3-6,Monica>Whatever, l really haven't thought about it that much.

87
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:18,250
<3-7,Chandler>我喜欢这个主意  当然喜欢
<3-7,Chandler>Well, l like that idea...obviously.

88
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:20,350
<3-7,Chandler>我在想或许...
<3-7,Chandler>l was thinking maybe...

89
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:22,840
<3-7,Chandler>可以弄个游戏房
<3-7,Chandler>maybe it could be a game room, you know.

90
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,810
<3-7,Chandler>我们可以买旧的游戏机
<3-7,Chandler>I mean you can buy old arcade games,

91
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:28,150
<3-7,Chandler>像太空入侵者和小行星  只要两百元
<3-7,Chandler>like Space lnvaders and Asteroids...for $200.

92
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:30,750
<3-7,Chandler>要买真的  要买大的  超大的
<3-7,Chandler>The real ones. The big, big, big ones!

93
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,480
<3-8,Monica>不要
<3-8,Monica>No.

94
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,590
<3-9,Chandler>你说"不"的意思是  "天啊  钱德勒
<3-9,Chandler>Okay so you mean no as in, "Gee, Chandler,

95
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:38,690
<3-9,Chandler>这个主意很有趣
<3-9,Chandler>what an interesting idea.

96
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:41,860
<3-9,Chandler>我们先讨论再全盘否定"
<3-9,Chandler>Let's discuss it before we reject it competely."

97
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:43,860
<3-9,Chandler>对不起
<3-9,Chandler>l'm sorry.

98
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:48,710
<3-10,Monica>很有趣的主意  可以讨论  但是不行
<3-10,Monica>lnteresting idea. We could talk about it. But no.

99
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:51,640
<3-11,Chandler>没有商量的余地吗
<3-11,Chandler>So that's it?

100
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:55,660
<3-12,Monica>我觉得漂亮的客房不适合放游戏机
<3-12,Monica>l just don't think that arcade games go in a beautiful guest room...

101
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,970
<3-12,Monica>漂亮的客房应该是满屋子古董
<3-12,Monica>the beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.

102
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:59,360
<3-13,Chandler>所以最适合放小行星了
<3-13,Chandler>Which is why Asteroids is perfect.

103
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,330
<3-13,Chandler>那可是最古老的游戏机
<3-13,Chandler>lt's the oldest game.

104
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:05,510
<3-14,Monica>你对漂亮的客房有什么意见吗
<3-14,Monica>What do you have against a beautiful guest room?

105
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,500
<3-15,Chandler>没有  我对漂亮的客房没有任何意见
<3-15,Chandler>Nothing, l don't have anything against a beautiful guest room.

106
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,360
<3-15,Chandler>尤其是我们认识的人
<3-15,Chandler>Especially since everybody that we know

107
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,660
<3-15,Chandler>都住在方圆数公尺内
<3-15,Chandler>lives about 30 seconds away.

108
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,250
<3-16,Monica>你是在讽刺我吗
<3-16,Monica>Are you mocking me?

109
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,970
<3-17,Chandler>不  我才没嘲笑你或你漂亮的客房
<3-17,Chandler>No, l'm not mocking you or your beautiful guest room.

110
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,420
<4-1,Joey>怎么了

<4-2,Chandler>Nothing, Monica and l had a stupid fight.

112
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,180
<4-3,Joey>但你们还是要同居  对吧
<4-3,Joey>But you're still moving in together, right?

113
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,950
<4-3,Joey>我的广告今天都出来了
<4-3,Joey>'Cause my ad came out today.

192
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,720
<7-3,Chandler>才去打游戏的
<7-3,Chandler>because l couldn't get girls.

<7-10,Monica>就是啊
<7-10,Monica>Totally.

214
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,260

<7-19,Chandler>那好  那我就全搬过来
<7-19,Chandler>That's cool. l'll bring them both over.
