48
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:08,030

<2-1,Ross>下载到这种电脑上
<2-1,Ross>and memories into this computer...

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,300
<3-1,Rachel>和生化机器人合体

00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,340
<4-4,Joey>我憋笑憋得好辛苦
<4-4,Joey>lt was so hard not to laugh.

<4-8,Joey>l've got this built-up flirting energy,

144
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,920

<4-15,Joey>l didn't want you to touch me...

153
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:56,740
<4-15,Joey>因为我拉筋拉得全身是汗
<4-15,Joey>...because l'm all sweaty from the workout.

<4-16,Janine>lt's just my thongs are too delicate for the dryer.

<4-17,Phoebe>没错  是我
<4-17,Phoebe>Oh, yeah, it's me.

<4-17,Phoebe>我看到你早上拿慢跑鞋  然后溜出来
<4-17,Phoebe>l saw you grab your running shoes this morning and sneak out.

160
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:28,960
<4-17,Phoebe>你骗我好独自跑步
<4-17,Phoebe>You lied so you could run by yourself.

161

<4-18,Rachel>不是的  菲比  我是...
<4-18,Rachel>No, Phoebe, no. l was....

00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:33,560
<4-18,Rachel>我只是跑跑看...
<4-18,Rachel>l was actually just checking...

163
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,700
<4-18,Rachel>看我
<4-18,Rachel>...to see...

164
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,840
<4-18,Rachel>能不能跑  结果可以
<4-18,Rachel>...if l could run. And l can!

165
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,720
<4-19,Phoebe>拜托  瑞秋  我又不是白痴
<4-19,Phoebe>Please, Rachel, l'm not an idiot.

166
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,320
<4-20,Rachel>等等  菲比
<4-20,Rachel>No, wait. Phoebe?

167
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:55,810
<4-21,Ross>真是夫妻住久了  举止会越来越像啊
<4-21,Ross>Couples who live together do start to look alike.

168
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:59,090
<4-21,Ross>莫德勒...
<4-21,Ross>So, Mondler....

169
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:04,930
<4-21,Ross>你这是在干嘛
<4-21,Ross>What are you doing?

170
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:07,260
<4-22,Chandler>你说呢  我在打扫啊
<4-22,Chandler>What does it look like? l am cleaning.

171
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,990
<4-23,Ross>你动她的东西  有经过她同意吗
<4-23,Ross>Did you get Monica's authorization to move all her stuff?

172
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:13,650
<4-24,Chandler>没必要  我会把东西都放回去
<4-24,Chandler>Authorization? I don't need that. l'll put everything back.

173
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:16,020
<4-25,Ross>完全恢复原状吗
<4-25,Ross>Put it back exactly where you found it?

174
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:19,490
<4-26,Chandler>当然是完全恢复原状
<4-26,Chandler>Yes. l'm gonna put it back exactly where l found it.

175
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,260
<4-27,Ross>首先  这种态度对你没有帮助
<4-27,Ross>First of all, that attitude is not helping.

176
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,140
<4-28,Chandler>她才不会在乎有没有恢复原状
<4-28,Chandler>She won't care if l put her stuff back in the same stupid place.

177
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:29,600
<4-29,Ross>你是刚认识莫妮卡吗
<4-29,Ross>Hello? Did you just meet Monica?

178
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,150
<4-30,Chandler>她会觉得我做得很好
<4-30,Chandler>She'll recognize that l did a nice thing...

179
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:35,500
<4-30,Chandler>并感到窝心
<4-30,Chandler>...and appreciate it.

180
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,350
<4-31,Ross>其实这样也蛮好的
<4-31,Ross>Actually, this will work out well.

181
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:40,480
<4-31,Ross>等你必须搬回去跟乔伊住
<4-31,Ross>Because when you have to move back with Joey...

182
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,930
<4-31,Ross>乔伊的新室友就可以来跟我住
<4-31,Ross>...Joey's hot new roommate can come live with me.

183
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:45,410
<4-32,Chandler>我懂了
<4-32,Chandler>Oh, l see, I see.

184
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:46,980
<4-32,Chandler>你想吓唬我
<4-32,Chandler>You're trying to freak me out.

185
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:50,160
<4-33,Ross>钱德勒  莫妮卡
<4-33,Ross>Look, Chandler, Monica is really weird

186
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,670
<4-33,Ross>对这种事有怪癖
<4-33,Ross>about this kind of stuff, all right?

187
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:53,860
<4-33,Ross>相信我  我跟她住了十六年
<4-33,Ross>Believe me, l lived with her for 1 6 years.

188
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:56,670
<4-33,Ross>她一定会抓狂
<4-33,Ross>She's going to freak out.

189
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:59,220
<4-33,Ross>我的天  她会坐扁你
<4-33,Ross>Oh, my God. She's going to sit on you.

190
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:02,580
<4-34,Chandler>她才不会  我证明给你看
<4-34,Chandler>No, she is not. Okay? You know l'll prove it to you.

00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,220
<4-34,Chandler>我现在就打给她
<4-34,Chandler>l'll call her right now.

192
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,120
<4-34,Chandler>电话擦好了
<4-34,Chandler>Phone's done.

193
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:12,680
<4-36,Chandler>-莫妮卡  工作如何  -烂透了
<4-36,Chandler>- Hey, Mon. How's it going? - Terrible.

194
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,280
<4-37,Monica>如果我要把事情搞好的话
<4-37,Monica>If-if I want something done right,

195
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,250
<4-37,Monica>那就全要亲力亲为
<4-37,Monica>l have to do it myself.

196
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,900
<4-37,Monica>其他人只会搞砸
<4-37,Monica>Other people just wreck stuff.

197
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:20,860
<4-37,Monica>我真觉得我今晚可能会杀人
<4-37,Monica>l really think l might kill someone tonight.

198
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:25,740
<4-38,Chandler>别这样  没那么糟吧
<4-38,Chandler>Come on, come on, it can't be that bad.

199
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,000
<4-39,Monica>是非常糟
<4-39,Monica>It's worse.

200
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,900
<4-39,Monica>想到快见到你了
<4-39,Monica>The only thing getting me through...

201
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,540
<4-39,Monica>我才撑得下去
<4-39,Monica>...is knowing l'll see you soon.

202
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,070
<4-39,Monica>我搞不好会设法早退  不要...
<4-39,Monica>l might even try to get out of here early.

203
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:33,300
<4-40,Chandler>不要  不要  不要
<4-40,Chandler>No! No-no-no-no-no-no.

204
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,050
<4-40,Chandler>不要了吧  餐厅似乎很需要你
<4-40,Chandler>No, no. It sounds like they need you there.

205
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:38,100
<4-41,Monica>-你跟罗斯在一起吗  -一切都很好  再见
<4-41,Monica>- You're just hanging out with Ross? - lt's all good! Okay, bye!

206
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,480
<4-42,Chandler>她会宰了我
<4-42,Chandler>She's gonna kill me.

207
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:45,350
<4-43,Ross>电话放反了
<4-43,Ross>The phone was facing the other way.

208
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:48,310
<4-43,Ross>相框应该摆在上面
<4-43,Ross>And that goes back up there.

209
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:53,120
<4-43,Ross>你知道我们要怎么做吗
<4-43,Ross>You know what we should do ?

210
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,440
<5-1,Chandler>先从大型家具复原起  那比较简单
<5-1,Chandler>We should start with the big stuff, you know? That'll be the easiest.

211
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:58,290
<5-1,Chandler>先搬沙发
<5-1,Chandler>So let's start with the couch.

212
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,150
<5-1,Chandler>我没问题
<5-1,Chandler>l got it.

213
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:06,520
<5-2,Ross>位置好像不对
<5-2,Ross>That doesn't look right.

214
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,430
<5-3,Chandler>什么意思
<5-3,Chandler>What are you talking about?

215
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:09,880
<5-3,Chandler>沙发刚好跟毯子对齐
<5-3,Chandler>The couch is perfectly in line with the carpet.

216
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:13,600
<5-3,Chandler>我可以走到这边  轻松的把脚翘在...
<5-3,Chandler>Then l can just walk over here and casually put my feet up on....

217
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,080
<5-3,Chandler>好  好  我们这样吧
<5-3,Chandler>Okay, okay, here's what we do.

218
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,470
<5-5,Chandler>把沙发往茶几那边推
<5-5,Chandler>We move the couch closer to the coffee table.

219
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:23,410
<5-4,Ross>那沙发的背后  就不会跟毯子边缘对齐了
<5-4,Ross>But then the back of the couch won't line up with the back of the carpet.

220
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,460
<5-5,Chandler>那我们就把茶几往沙发
<5-5,Chandler>OK, well, here.We'll just move the coffee table...

221
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,640
<5-5,Chandler>那边推
<5-5,Chandler>...closer to the couch.

222
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:33,160
<5-6,Ross>那茶几就不在座位区正中央了
<5-6,Ross>But then the coffee table won't be centered in the seating area.

223
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:36,030
<5-7,Chandler>那茶几就和桌子就不搭配了
<5-7,Chandler>But the coffee table doesn't match the table!

224
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:37,400
<5-7,Chandler>罗斯
<5-7,Chandler>Ross!

225
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,770
<5-8,Joey>我该怎么办
<5-8,Joey>Look, what am l gonna do?

226
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:44,180
<5-8,Joey>我不调情  却还是
<5-8,Joey>l'm not flirting, but still...

227
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:47,690
<5-8,Joey>强烈被她吸引  就像飞蛾被火吸引
<5-8,Joey>l'm drawing her to me like a moth to a flame!

228
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:55,020
<5-8,Joey>这里是怎么了
<5-8,Joey>What the hell's going on over here?

229
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,190
<5-8,Joey>莫妮卡会宰了你
<5-8,Joey>Monica's gonna kill you!

230
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,880
<5-8,Joey>我需要你们的帮忙
<5-8,Joey>Look, I need your help. Okay?

231
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,500
<5-8,Joey>我得想办法把这个女人吓跑
<5-8,Joey>l have to do something to repel this woman.

232
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,580
<5-8,Joey>等等  等等
<5-8,Joey>Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

233
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,890
<5-8,Joey>你们最会把女人吓跑了
<5-8,Joey>You guys repel women all the time!

234
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:12,850
<5-9,Ross>我可是结过三次婚的人
<5-9,Ross>Hey, l've been married three times.

235
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:19,730
<5-10,Joey>不不不  我亲眼见识过
<5-10,Joey>No, no, no. l've seen it happen.

236
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:22,080
<5-10,Joey>你们跟女人交往得好好的
<5-10,Joey>You get a rapport going with a woman,

237
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,550
<5-10,Joey>最后却总是能搞砸
<5-10,Joey>but somehow you manage to kill it.

238
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:26,900
<5-10,Joey>你们的秘诀是什么
<5-10,Joey>What's your secret?

239
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:31,010
<5-11,Ross>我们并不会把女人吓跑
<5-11,Ross>Look, we do not repel women, okay?

240
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:32,850
<5-11,Ross>完全没有这回事
<5-11,Ross>That is completely untrue.

241
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:35,430
<5-12,Chandler>我们确实会
<5-12,Chandler>Oh, yes, we do, my man.

242
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:38,610
<5-12,Chandler>记不记得大学时参加春季舞会
<5-12,Chandler>Remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance

243
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:39,850
<5-12,Chandler>你走到心仪的女生前
<5-12,Chandler>And you walked right up to that girl you liked

00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,130
<10-5,Chandler>就让这个房间蓬荜生辉
<10-5,Chandler>when you came into it.

362
00:19:57,550 --> 00:20:00,580
<10-6,Monica>小茶几位置不对  沙发怪怪的
<10-6,Monica>The end table is wrong, the couch looks bizarre...

363
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:03,340
<10-6,Monica>更别提冰箱上的磁铁
<10-6,Monica>...and don't even get me started on the refrigerator magnets.

364
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:07,010
<10-7,Chandler>好  你别生气  千万别生气
<10-7,Chandler>Okay look, don't...don't be mad okay?

365
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:11,750
<10-7,Chandler>我整理完东西  想做点让你高兴的事
<10-7,Chandler>But, after l unpacked the boxes, l wanted to do something nice for you...

366
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:14,930
<10-7,Chandler>所以我就大扫除
<10-7,Chandler>...so l cleaned the apartment.

367
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,930
<10-7,Chandler>我把东西乱搬  却忘了
<10-7,Chandler>So l moved everything around, and then l forgot...

368
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:19,900
<10-7,Chandler>该怎么恢复原状
<10-7,Chandler>...where it went back.

369
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:22,320
<10-7,Chandler>对不起  对不起  对不起
<10-7,Chandler>l'm sorry, l'm very sorry, l'm sorry.

370
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:25,600
<10-7,Chandler>没关系
<10-7,Chandler>That's okay.

371
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:28,400
<10-8,Monica>钱德勒  你是在怕我吗
<10-8,Monica>Chandler, Are you afraid of me or something?

372
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:31,160
<10-9,Chandler>你想我怕你吗
<10-9,Chandler>Do you want me to be afraid of you?

373
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:34,140
<10-12,Monica>当然不要
<10-12,Monica>Of course not.

374
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:38,120
<10-10,Monica>拜托  钱德勒  你做了这么棒的事
<10-10,Monica>My gosh, Chandler, what you did is a wonderful thing...

375
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,920
<10-10,Monica>我真的很开心
<10-10,Monica>...and l really appreciate it.

376
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:43,080
<10-10,Monica>我知道我追求完美  所以有点强迫症
<10-10,Monica>I know I have this weird thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place,

377
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:46,430
<10-10,Monica>但我万万没想到你会担心这个
<10-10,Monica>But l'd never expect you to worry about that.

378
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,260
<10-11,Chandler>真的
<10-11,Chandler>Really?

379
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:50,190
<10-12,Monica>当然是真的
<10-12,Monica>Of course.

380
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:52,740
<10-13,Chandler>你最好了
<10-13,Chandler>Oh, you're the best.

381
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,660
<10-13,Chandler>过来我抱抱
<10-13,Chandler>You come here to me.

382
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,090
<10-14,Monica>等等  先做该做的事
<10-14,Monica>Hold on, okay? First things first.

383
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,810
<10-14,Monica>罗斯光着身体时坐过哪里
<10-14,Monica>Did Ross sit anywhere while he was naked?

384
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:09,890
<11-1,Ross>书上说到了2030年
<11-1,Ross>So it said that by the year 2030,

385
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,390
<11-1,Ross>会出现功能复杂的电脑
<11-1,Ross>there'll be computers that can carry out the same number of functions

386
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:15,670
<11-1,Ross>跟人脑一样
<11-1,Ross>as an actual human brain.

387
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:19,330
<11-1,Ross>所以理论上人可以把思想和记忆
<11-1,Ross>So, theoretically, you could download your thoughts...

388
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:21,840
<11-2,Janine>下载到这种电脑上
<11-2,Janine>...and your memories into this computer- -

389
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,570
<11-2,Janine>然后以机器的形态长生不死
<11-2,Janine>And live forever as a machine.

390
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:33,290
<11-3,Ross>吉尼  你知道我们现在在做什么吗
<11-3,Ross>Janine, do you know what we're doing right now?

391
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:36,140
<11-3,Ross>我们在资料传输
<11-3,Ross>You and l, we're interfacing.

392
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:39,420
