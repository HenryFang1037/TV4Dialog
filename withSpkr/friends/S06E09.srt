<1-5,Monica>l was thinking we'd eat around 4.

11
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:25,040
<1-6,Chandler>为什么不能提同居的事
<1-6,Chandler>Why can't l tell them we live together?

12
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,240
<1-7,Monica>因为他们不知道我们在交往
<1-7,Monica>They don't know we're dating.

13
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,480
<1-7,Monica>要不要在厨房吃呢
<1-7,Monica>Do you think we should eat in the kitchen?

14
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,210
<1-8,Chandler>你为什么没有告诉他们
<1-8,Chandler>Why haven't you told them?

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,180
<1-9,Monica>我本来要说  真的
<1-9,Monica>Well, l was going to. l really was.

16
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,580
<1-9,Monica>但是后来不知怎的就没说了
<1-9,Monica>But then somewhere, just out of nowhere, l didn't.

17
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,980
<1-10,Chandler>为什么没说  他们知道会不开心吗
<1-10,Chandler>Why haven't you told them?! Wouldn't they be happy?!

00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,520
<1-11,Monica>四点左右厨房开饭  到时候见

19
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,230
<1-12,Chandler>他们为什么不会开心
<1-12,Chandler>Why wouldn't they be happy?

20
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:47,050
<1-13,Monica>因为
<1-13,Monica>Well, because...

21
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,160
<1-13,Monica>主要是
<1-13,Monica>...mainly...

22
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:52,330
<1-13,Monica>他们不喜欢你
<1-13,Monica>...they don't like you.

23
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,970
<1-14,Chandler>-对不起  -什么  为什么
<1-14,Chandler>- l'm sorry. - What? Why? Why?

24
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:59,110
<1-15,Monica>也许是因为你以前孤僻又嘴毒
<1-15,Monica>Maybe because you used to be aloof...or that you're sarcastic

25
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:01,110
<1-15,Monica>还老爱开玩笑
<1-15,Monica>Or that, y'know, you joke around all the time.

26
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:03,910
<1-15,Monica>也可能是因为你脱了衣服都乱丢
<1-15,Monica>...or that you throw your clothes on the couch.

27
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:06,620
<1-16,Chandler>这是他们对我的看法  还是你的看法
<1-16,Chandler>ls this why they don't like me or why you don't like me?

28
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,170
<1-16,Chandler>我知道我应该告诉他们
<1-16,Chandler>l know l should have told them.

29
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:11,310
<1-17,Monica>我不该在意他们的想法
<1-17,Monica>l shouldn't care what they think.

30
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:12,770
<1-13,Monica>对不起
<1-13,Monica>l'm sorry.

31
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,600
<1-18,Chandler>没关系  这没关系
<1-18,Chandler>You know, it'll be okay. It'll be okay.

32
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,900
<1-18,Chandler>等他们来了  我会表现得很迷人
<1-18,Chandler>Because when they come over, I will be all charming,

33
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,590
<1-18,Chandler>我会让他们爱上我  然后我们再告诉他们
<1-18,Chandler>l will make them love me, then we'll tell them.

34
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:21,890
<1-19,Monica>你真的觉得这样可行吗
<1-19,Monica>You really think that'll work?

35
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:25,570
<1-20,Chandler>我也可以很有魅力  我不就赢得了你的心吗
<1-20,Chandler>l can be pretty charming, babe. l won you over, didn't l?

36
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,430
<1-21,Monica>你应该不能把他们灌到那么醉
<1-21,Monica>l don't think you'll ever get my parents that drunk.

48

<2-5,Chandler>Do you know why?

54
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,070
<2-6,Ross>也许是因为你很尖酸刻薄
<2-6,Ross>Maybe it's because you're sarcastic

55
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:25,810
<2-6,Ross>或者是因为
<2-6,Ross>or maybe it's because you--

56
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:28,090
<2-7,Chandler>他们不知道就不要乱猜
<2-7,Chandler>lf people don't know, they shouldn't just guess!

57

<2-8,Chandler>太好了  又一个不值得感恩的感恩节
<2-8,Chandler>This is great, another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for.

<2-9,Joey>如果你闭嘴的话  我会感恩
<2-9,Joey>Maybe l give thanks for you shutting up, huh?

59
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:40,190
<2-10,Chandler>如果你把我的电动还我  我也会感恩
<2-10,Chandler>Maybe l give thanks by taking my PlayStation to my place.

<2-11,Joey>我也爱你
<2-11,Joey>Maybe l love you.

69
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,080
<2-20,Janine>我们没有人会做菜
<2-20,Janine>Because none of us knows how to cook,

70
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,300
<2-20,Janine>最后估计都是在喝酒
<2-20,Janine>we'll probably just end up drinking all day.

<2-22,Ross>because it's my sister.

74
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:19,740
<2-22,Ross>不过有个妹妹是好事
<2-22,Ross>But, you know, actually, growing up with a sister was nice...

75
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:22,380
<2-22,Ross>让我很了解女人心

00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,760
<4-2,Mr. Geller>就算我有头皮屑
<4-2,Mr. Geller>Okay, l have dandruff.

131
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:18,470
<4-2,Mr. Geller>你也不必指着我笑
<4-2,Mr. Geller>There's no need to laugh and point.

132
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,210
<4-3,Monica>爸  钱德勒是在笑你的笑话
<4-3,Monica>Dad, Chandler was just laughing at your joke.

133
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:23,900
<4-4,Mr. Geller>我的笑话又不好笑
<4-4,Mr. Geller>My joke wasn't funny.

134
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,720
<4-4,Mr. Geller>瑞秋  我刚刚想到
<4-4,Mr. Geller>Rach, l just remembered.

135
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,150
<4-4,Mr. Geller>我昨晚梦到盖勒先生
<4-4,Mr. Geller>l had a dream about Mr. Geller last night.

136
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:32,230
<5-1,Phoebe>真的吗
<5-1,Phoebe>Really?

137
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:35,000
<5-2,Rachel>对  我梦到他把我从火场救出
<5-2,Rachel>Yeah. l dreamt that he saved me from a burning building...

138
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,350
<5-3,Phoebe>他好英勇好强壮
<5-3,Phoebe>...and he was so brave and so strong.

139
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:40,400
<5-3,Phoebe>让我对他完全改观
<5-3,Phoebe>And it's making me look at him totally differently.

140
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,490
<5-3,Phoebe>他以前只是杰克·盖勒
<5-3,Phoebe>Y'know, I mean he used to be just, y'know

141
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:46,440
<5-3,Phoebe>莫妮卡和罗斯的爸爸
<5-3,Phoebe>"Jack Geller Monica and Ross's dad"

142
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,500
<5-3,Phoebe>现在他是杰克·盖勒  我的梦中情人
<5-3,Phoebe>Now he's "Jack Geller, dream hunk."

143
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:53,860
<5-3,Phoebe>不知道
<5-3,Phoebe>l don't know.

144
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:56,190
<5-4,Rachel>对我来说他永远都是杰克·盖勒
<5-4,Rachel>No. You know, to me, he'll always be "Jack Geller...

145
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:58,170
<5-4,Rachel>在你换衣服时闯进来
<5-4,Rachel>...walks in while you're changing."

146
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:05,420
<5-5,Monica>爸  钱德勒是罗斯最要好的朋友之一
<5-5,Monica>You know, Dad, Chandler is one of Ross' very best friends.

147
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,080
<5-6,Chandler>罗斯是个好青年
<5-6,Chandler>Ross sure is a great guy.

148
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:09,400
<5-6,Chandler>我一直觉得儿子
<5-6,Chandler>You know I've always felt that how a young man turns out

149
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,390
<5-6,Chandler>就是父亲的翻版
<5-6,Chandler>...is a reflection on his father.

150
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:14,360
<5-7,Mr. Geller>我也有深有同感
<5-7,Mr. Geller>l always thought that too.

151
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:16,270
<5-7,Mr. Geller>请问你爸是做什么的
<5-7,Mr. Geller>Tell me, what does your father do?

152
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,990
<5-8,Chandler>他是同志
<5-8,Chandler>He's a headliner of a...

153
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:23,070
<5-8,Chandler>歌舞秀的头牌
<5-8,Chandler>...gay burlesque show.

154
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,330
<5-9,Joey>瑞秋  急死我们了
<5-9,Joey>Rach, you're killing us here,

00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:28,950
<5-9,Joey>能快点上甜点吗
<5-9,Joey>Will you serve the dessert already?

156
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:31,270
<5-9,Joey>有酒醉的舞者都在等我们
<5-9,Joey>There's drunken dancers a- waiting!

159
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,030
<5-12,Rachel>酒果酱松糕  有很多层
<5-12,Rachel>lt's a trifle. lt's got all these layers.

160
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:41,600
<5-12,Rachel>先是一层松脆饼  然后是一层果酱
<5-12,Rachel>First there's a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam,

161
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,250
<5-12,Rachel>然后是我自己做的乳蛋糕
<5-12,Rachel>...then custard, which l made from scratch...

162
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:47,320
<5-12,Rachel>然后是覆盆子  然后更多松脆饼
<5-12,Rachel>...then raspberries, more ladyfingers...

163
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,800
<5-12,Rachel>然后是豌豆洋葱炒嫩牛肉
<5-12,Rachel>...then beef sauteed with peas and onions...

164
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,400

00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,960
<5-13,Ross>香蕉前面是什么
<5-13,Ross>What was the one right before bananas?

167
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:09,250
<5-14,Rachel>炒牛肉吗  我也觉得有点奇怪
<5-14,Rachel>The beef. Yeah, that was weird to me too.

168
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:12,850
<5-14,Rachel>不过我想说连甜肉馅饼都有了
<5-14,Rachel>But then, y'know, I thought "well, there's mincemeat pie,"

169
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:13,980
<5-14,Rachel>那是也是一种英式甜点
<5-14,Rachel>I mean that's an English dessert,

170
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:17,310
<5-14,Rachel>英国人会放一堆怪东西在食物里嘛
<5-14,Rachel>These people just put strange things in their food.

<5-23,Joey>完了  她得重做了
<5-23,Joey>Man, now she's gonna start all over.

184
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,950
<5-23,Joey>我们不能介绍辣妹认识新世界了
<5-23,Joey>We're never gonna get to introduce the hot girls to the New World.

00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:17,370
<5-25,Joey>然后让她给大家吃牛肉乳蛋糕吗
<5-25,Joey>Just let her serve the beef-custard thing?

208
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:27,780
<6-1,Ross>我大概知道  我爸妈为什么不喜欢你了
<6-1,Ross>Okay, I think I might know why my parents don't like you.

209
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:28,860
<6-2,Chandler>是吗  为什么
<6-2,Chandler>You do? Why?

210
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,850

211
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,670
<6-3,Ross>大二的春假
<6-3,Ross>Spring break, sophomore year,

212
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,860
<6-3,Ross>我在房里抽大麻
<6-3,Ross>l got high in my bedroom...

213
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,990
<6-3,Ross>我爸妈走进来闻到了
<6-3,Ross>...and my parents walked in and smelled it...

214
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,440
<6-3,Ross>于是我就说是你刚抽了大麻
<6-3,Ross>...so l told them that you had gotten stoned

215
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,400
<6-3,Ross>然后跳窗跑了
<6-3,Ross>and jumped out the window.

216
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:45,370
<6-4,Chandler>什么  你为什么要赖到我身上
<6-4,Chandler>What?! Why did you do that?

217
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:46,550
<6-4,Chandler>我不知道
<6-4,Chandler>l don't know.

218
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:49,520
<6-5,Ross>我第一个想到的  就是你的名字
<6-5,Ross>Yours was the first name that popped into my head.

219
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,620
<6-5,Ross>对不起  我以为不会怎样
<6-5,Ross>I'm I'm sorry. I-I didn't think it would matter.

220
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,830
<6-6,Chandler>怎么可能不会怎样呢
<6-6,Chandler>How could it not matter?

221
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:55,700
<6-7,Ross>我怎么知道我们会从室友变成死党
<6-7,Ross>How was I supposed to know we'd end up being friends after college,

222
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,810
<6-7,Ross>更想不到你会跟我妹同居了
<6-7,Ross>...and you'd be living with my sister?

223
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:00,040
<6-8,Chandler>那些"生死之交"的豪言呢
<6-8,Chandler>What about the "friends forever" stuff?

224
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,760
<6-9,Ross>不晓得  我当时嗑傻了
<6-9,Ross>l don't know. l was all high.

225
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,120
<7-1,Monica>爸妈叫我来看看
<7-1,Monica>Mom and Dad sent me to find out

226
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,600
<7-1,Monica>你是不是想找罗斯嗑药
<7-1,Monica>if you were trying to get Ross stoned.

227
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,140
<7-2,Chandler>罗斯大学抽大麻被他们逮到
<7-2,Chandler>Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college,

228
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,880
<7-2,Chandler>他居然赖到我身上
<7-2,Chandler>and he blamed it on me!

229
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,180
<7-3,Monica>罗斯  你怎么能这样呢
<7-3,Monica>Ross, I can't believe you'd do that!

230
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,770
<7-4,Chandler>就是因为他们讨厌我  我们才没公开
<7-4,Chandler>We haven't told them we're together because they hate me, okay?

231
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:26,400
<7-4,Chandler>麻烦你搞定他们
<7-4,Chandler>So will you fix this?

232
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,350
<7-5,Ross>好啦  我会说抽嗨的不是钱德勒
<7-5,Ross>Okay, okay, l'll tell them it wasn't Chandler who got high.

233
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,660
<7-5,Ross>那我要说是谁呢
<7-5,Ross>Now, who should l say it was?

234
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,510
<7-6,Monica>你啊  这又没什么
<7-6,Monica>You! lt's not like it's a big deal.

235
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:38,490
<7-6,Monica>你现在又没在嗑药
<7-6,Monica>You don't still do it or anything.

236
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,570
<7-6,Monica>好啦好啦
<7-6,Monica>All right.

237
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:43,320
<7-7,Ross>那我要说是谁骗我这么做的呢
<7-7,Ross>Now, who should l say tricked me into doing it?

238
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,320
<8-1,Monica>爸  请别在这里剔牙
<8-1,Monica>Dad, please don't pick your teeth out here.

239

<8-1,Monica>如果你要翘脚  怎么不坐
<8-1,Monica>And if you're gonna put your feet up- -

<8-6,Rachel>when Rachel screwed up the trifle?"

253
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,560

<9-52,Rachel>然后叼着飞走
<9-52,Rachel>...and then tried to fly away with it...

345
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:51,140
<9-52,Rachel>最后掉到马路上了

347
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:57,710
<9-53,Chandler>掉下去之前  它好像吃得很开心
<9-53,Chandler>before the bird dropped it...he seemed to enjoy it.

<9-54,Phoebe>瑞秋  来一下
<9-54,Phoebe>Rachel, come here.
