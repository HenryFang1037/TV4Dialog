1
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:07,720
<1-1,Monica>你知道再过四个星期我们就要结婚了吗
<1-1,Monica>Do you realize that four weeks from today we're getting married?

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,490
<1-1,Monica>四个星期  宝贝  四个星期
<1-1,Monica>Four weeks, baby. Four weeks!

3
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:13,920
<1-2,Chandler>你知道每星期你都叫得更大声吗
<1-2,Chandler>Do you realize that you get louder each week?

4
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:16,460
<1-3,Monica>还有这么多事要做
<1-3,Monica>There's still so much to do!

5
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:18,490
<1-3,Monica>你写好你的婚誓了吗
<1-3,Monica>Have you written your vows yet?

6
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:22,730
<1-4,Chandler>我会去买那种"派得  我要买婚誓"
<1-4,Chandler>I figured I'd just buy those. "Pat, I'd like to buy a vow."

7
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:25,520
<1-5,Monica>亲爱的  要知道一说到婚礼的事
<1-5,Monica>Sweetie, you know I've no sense of humor

8
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,100
<1-5,Monica>我是没有心情开玩笑的
<1-5,Monica>when it comes to the wedding.

9
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,660
<1-6,Chandler>好吧  你写好了吗
<1-6,Chandler>Right. So have you written yours yet?

10
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:33,940
<1-7,Monica>没有  但我知道自己要说什么
<1-7,Monica>No, but I know exactly what I'm gonna say.

11
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:37,270
<1-8,Chandler>你会不会刚好知道我要说什么
<1-8,Chandler>Do you happen to know exactly what I'm gonna say?

12
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:42,110
<1-9,Monica>咱们现在就写  没那么难
<1-9,Monica>Let's do it now. It won't be hard.

13
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:43,820
<1-9,Monica>就写自己的心里话
<1-9,Monica>Say what's in your heart.

14
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:54,360
<1-10,Chandler>看她写得多快  她一定爱我比我爱她更多
<1-10,Chandler>Look at her go. She must love me more than I love her!

15
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,860
<1-10,Chandler>我有什么问题  别打开那扇回忆之门
<1-10,Chandler>What's wrong with me? Don't open that door.

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,500
<2-1,Chandler>"莫妮卡  没有语言..."
<2-1,Chandler>"Monica, there are no words..."

28
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:52,090
<2-1,Chandler>根本就是哑口无言  不该这么费劲啊
<2-1,Chandler>There are no words! This shouldn't be this hard!

29
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,570
<2-2,Joey>你之前写过这个  罗斯
<2-2,Joey>You've done this before, Ross.

30
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,660
<2-2,Joey>你的婚誓里说了些什么
<2-2,Joey>What did you say when you made up your vows?

31
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:58,830
<2-3,Ross>对卡罗尔  我答应她直到我死
<2-3,Ross>With Carol, I promised never to love another woman

32
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,950
<2-3,Ross>不会再爱另一个女人
<2-3,Ross>until the day I die.

33
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,520
<2-3,Ross>她却没这样答应我
<2-3,Ross>She made no such promise.

34
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,520
<2-4,Chandler>我真悲哀  莫妮卡就知道要讲什么
<2-4,Chandler>I'm so pathetic. Monica knows what she wants to say.

35
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,030
<2-4,Chandler>看她奋笔疾书的样子  不停地写呀写
<2-4,Chandler>You should have seen her writing and writing and writing.

36
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:13,390
<3-2,Phoebe>莫妮卡  什么紧急大事
<3-2,Phoebe>Monica, what? What's the emergency?

37
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:14,560
<3-3,Rachel>帮我个忙
<3-3,Rachel>You have to help me.

38
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,700
<3-4,Monica>我本应写我的婚誓  可却只搞出这个
<3-4,Monica>I'm supposed to write my vows and all I have is this.

39
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:22,070
<3-5,Rachel>我喜欢你穿婚纱的卡通模样
<3-5,Rachel>I like the pretty little drawing of you in the wedding dress.

40
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:26,800
<3-6,Monica>不过你的胸部看来有点小
<3-6,Monica>Except your breasts look kind of small.

41
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,750
<3-7,Phoebe>那是我的眼睛
<3-7,Phoebe>Those are my eyes!

42
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:35,450
<3-8,Monica>-那是我的胸部  -好吧
<3-8,Monica>- Those are my breasts. - Oh, yeah, okay.

43
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:41,010
<4-1,Ross>何不从简单的开始  像是
<4-1,Ross>Why don't you just start with something simple, like:

44
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:42,660
<4-1,Ross>"莫妮卡
<4-1,Ross>"Monica,

45
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:46,800
<4-1,Ross>第一次见到你  我就知道我爱你"
<4-1,Ross>from the moment I met you, I knew I loved you."

46
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:48,810
<4-2,Chandler>这貌似不是实话
<4-2,Chandler>I'm not sure I can do that.

47
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,580
<4-3,Ross>各位  这是钱德勒
<4-3,Ross>Everyone, this is Chandler.

48
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,840
<4-4,Fat Monica>我是罗斯的小妹
<4-4,Fat Monica>Hi, I'm Ross' little sister.

49
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:55,770
<4-5,Chandler>好吧
<4-5,Chandler>Okay.

50
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,900
<4-5,Chandler>好  你可以这样开头
<4-5,Chandler>Okay, okay. Maybe you could start with:

51
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,930
<5-1,Rachel>钱德勒  即使在我们还是朋友的时候
<5-1,Rachel>"Chandler, even though we were friends...

52
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:08,410
<5-1,Rachel>我都一直知道自己想跟你更进一步
<5-1,Rachel>...there was a part of me that always knew I wanted more."

53
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:11,230
<5-2,Chandler>好吧  经过一场核武器战争
<5-2,Chandler>All right, there's a nuclear holocaust.

54
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:13,710
<5-2,Chandler>我是地球上最后一个男人
<5-2,Chandler>I'm the last man on earth.

55
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,220
<5-2,Chandler>你会和我约会吗
<5-2,Chandler>Would you go out with me?

56
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:18,470
<5-3,Monica>好吧

57
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:23,030
<5-4,Monica>婚誓里可以说谎吗
<5-4,Monica>Are we allowed to lie in the vows?

58
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:27,000
<5-5,Phoebe>你可以不谈自己以前的感受
<5-5,Phoebe>Maybe you don't talk about your feelings back then.

59
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,110
<5-5,Phoebe>你可以谈谈
<5-5,Phoebe>Maybe you just say something about

60
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:32,030
<5-5,Phoebe>他教会你的事情  像是...
<5-5,Phoebe>all the things that he's taught you, like...

61
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,420
<5-5,Phoebe>或是你教会他的事

93
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,550
<8-6,Monica>我为什么会到40岁还没结婚
<8-6,Monica>Why wouldn't I be married when I'm 40?

00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:37,690
<8-7,Chandler>不  我是说假设

<8-8,Monica>Hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?

00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:46,240
<8-10,Monica>说真的  我身上有什么不适合结婚的特质吗
<8-10,Monica>Seriously, is there something fundamentally un-marriable about me?

<8-12,Monica>怎么样
<8-12,Monica>Well?

108
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:50,560
<10-10,Monica>没事  我说你真棒  然后就没说话了
<10-10,Monica>Nothing! I said, you're so great, and then I just stopped talking.

109
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:55,630
<10-11,Chandler>-你说你爱我  真不敢相信  -我没说
<10-11,Chandler>- You said you love me! I can't believe this. - No, I didn't.

<10-15,Chandler>住嘴  住嘴  住嘴
<10-15,Chandler>Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

113
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:13,860
<11-1,Chandler>我在想  如果我在这里拆包行李呢
<11-1,Chandler>You know, I was thinking, what if I unpack here?

114
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:16,200
<11-2,Monica>那你的东西都会放在这里
<11-2,Monica>Then all your stuff would be here.

115
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,360
<8-12,Monica>那...
<8-12,Monica>Well...

116
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:24,130
<11-3,Chandler>如果我的东西都在这里的话呢
<11-3,Chandler>What if all my stuff was here?

117
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,170
<11-4,Monica>那你就会一直来来往往的
<11-4,Monica>Then you'd be going back and forth all the time.

118
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,920
<11-4,Monica>没什么意义
<11-4,Monica>Doesn't make any sense.

119
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,470
<11-4,Monica>好
<11-4,Monica>Okay.

120
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:37,300
<11-5,Chandler>如果我们住在一起呢  你明白我在说什么吗
<11-5,Chandler>What if we live together, and you understand what I'm saying?

121
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,080
<12-1,Monica>你希望这是一个惊喜
<12-1,Monica>You wanted it to be a surprise.

<12-3,Monica>从没想过会如此幸运...
<12-3,Monica>...I never thought I would be so lucky...

00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,470
<12-3,Monica>女生不求婚是有原因的
<12-3,Monica>There's a reason why girls don't do this!

<12-3,Monica>I thought...

131
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:39,840
<12-4,Chandler>我做得到
<12-4,Chandler>I can do this.

132
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,640
<12-4,Chandler>我以为...
<12-4,Chandler>I thought...

133
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:49,930
<12-4,Chandler>我说什么内容  在哪里求婚很重要
<12-4,Chandler>...that it mattered what I said or where I said it.

134
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:55,800
<12-4,Chandler>但我发现唯一重要的是你...
<12-4,Chandler>Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you...

135
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,330
<12-4,Chandler>和你在一起的日子
<12-4,Chandler>You make me happier

136
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:04,610
<12-4,Chandler>我感受到前所未有的幸福
<12-4,Chandler>than I ever thought I could be.

137
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:09,160
<12-4,Chandler>如果你愿意...
<12-4,Chandler>And if you let me...

138
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:13,820
<12-4,Chandler>我要用这一生的时间来给你同样的幸福感受
<12-4,Chandler>I'll spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way.

139
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,530
<12-4,Chandler>莫妮卡
<12-4,Chandler>Monica?

140
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,300
<12-5,Monica>你愿意嫁给我吗
<12-5,Monica>Will you marry me?

141
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:31,870
<12-5,Monica>我愿意
<12-5,Monica>Yes.

142
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:48,010
<12-6,Joey>我们可以进来了吗  我们要急死了
<12-6,Joey>Can we come in yet? We're dying out here!

143
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,150
<12-7,Monica>进来  进来
<12-7,Monica>Come in! Come in!

144
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:54,440
<12-7,Monica>-我们订婚了  -太棒了
<12-7,Monica>- We're engaged! - Yes!

145
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,570
<13-5,Rachel>你们在干嘛
<13-5,Rachel>What have you guys been up to?

146
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:12,150
<13-6,Ross>帮钱德勒写他的婚誓  但被他踢出来了...
<13-6,Ross>We were helping Chandler write his vows, but he kicked us out...

147
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:15,260
<13-6,Ross>因为乔伊一直提不恰当的建议
<13-6,Ross>...because Joey kept making inappropriate suggestions.

148
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:20,560
<13-7,Joey>"莫妮卡  我爱你的美臀"有什么不恰当
<13-7,Joey>How is "Monica, I love your sweet ass" inappropriate?

149
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:24,250
<13-8,Ross>莫妮卡写得怎么样
<13-8,Ross>How's Monica coming along with her vows?

150
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,020
<13-9,Phoebe>这样说吧  幸好她还有美臀
<13-9,Phoebe>Let's say it's lucky she's got a sweet ass

151
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:28,280
<13-9,Phoebe>因为她不太擅长写这个
<13-9,Phoebe>because she's not so good at the writing.

152
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,920
<13-10,Ross>真不敢相信再过四个星期他们就要结婚了
<13-10,Ross>I can't believe in four weeks they're gonna be married!

153
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,860
<13-11,Phoebe>希望他们的婚姻美满
<13-11,Phoebe>Let's just hope it works.

154
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:37,880
<13-11,Phoebe>十对夫妇有九对以离婚收场
<13-11,Phoebe>Nine out of 10 marriages end in divorce.

155
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,610
<13-12,Ross>菲比  没有的事
<13-12,Ross>Phoebe, that's not true.

156
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:42,390
<13-13,Phoebe>是啊  你说得对  你的太太们好吗
<13-13,Phoebe>Yeah, you're right. How's the missus?

157
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,520
<13-14,Rachel>真不能相信他们在一起三年了
<13-14,Rachel>I can't believe they've been together 3 years.

158
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,810
<13-15,Joey>那么久了吗
<13-15,Joey>Has it been that long?

159
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:51,710
<13-16,Ross>感觉没那么久  因为他们瞒了我们很久
<13-16,Ross>Maybe it seems like less because they hid it from us for so long.

160
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,580
<13-17,Joey>是我  进来了
<13-17,Joey>Hey, it's me. Coming in.

161
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,860
<13-18,Chandler>我今天辛苦了一整天
<13-18,Chandler>I've had a very long, hard day.

162
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,170
<13-19,Joey>我要去买炸鸡  你要不要
<13-19,Joey>I'm gonna get some chicken. You want some?

163
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,440
<13-20,Chandler>不用  谢了  不要炸鸡  再见
<13-20,Chandler>No, thanks. No, chicken. Bye, then.

164
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:15,130
<13-21,Joey>你还好吧  实在抱歉  他不肯走
<13-21,Joey>Are you okay? I'm so sorry. He wouldn't leave.

165
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:17,330
<13-22,Chandler>一直问我要不要炸鸡
<13-22,Chandler>He kept asking if I wanted chicken.

166
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,190
<13-23,Monica>炸鸡
<13-23,Monica>Chicken?

167
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,890
<13-23,Monica>我可以吃点炸鸡
<13-23,Monica>I could eat some chicken.

168
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:24,800
<13-24,Chandler>乔伊
<13-24,Chandler>Hey, Joe!

169
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:32,190
<13-25,Chandler>我想要三块鸡  沙拉  豆子  还有可乐
<13-25,Chandler>Can I get a three-piece, some coleslaw and some beans and a Coke?

170
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,990
<13-25,Chandler>健怡可乐
<13-25,Chandler>Diet Coke.

171
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:40,150
<14-1,Rachel>我不知道他们为什么不告诉我们
<14-1,Rachel>I don't know why they didn't just tell us.

172
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,570
<14-2,Joey>好像我们会很不淡定似的
<14-2,Joey>I know. It's not like we weren't cool about it.

173
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:45,230
<14-3,Joey>你  和你
<14-3,Joey>You? And you?

174
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:48,880
<14-4,Monica>你不能说  没有人知道
<14-4,Monica>Yes, but you cannot tell. No one knows.

175
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,560
<14-5,Joey>怎么发生的  何时发生的
<14-5,Joey>How? When?

176
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,370
<14-6,Chandler>-在伦敦发生的  -在伦敦
<14-6,Chandler>- It happened in London. - In London?!

177
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,330
<14-8,Chandler>我们没告诉任何人
<14-8,Chandler>The reason we didn't tell anyone was

178
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:00,500
<14-8,Chandler>不希望把事情搞大
<14-8,Chandler>because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.

179
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,390
<14-9,Joey>可这就是大事
<14-9,Joey>But it is a big deal!

180
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:05,180
<14-9,Joey>-我一定要告诉别人  -不要
<14-9,Joey>- I have to tell someone. - No, no!

181
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,770
<14-11,Monica>-不要  -拜托
<14-11,Monica>- You can't. - Please, please!

182
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:10,340
<14-11,Monica>我们不想面对大家的反应
<14-11,Monica>We don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay?

183
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:12,230
<14-11,Monica>答应我你不会说
<14-11,Monica>Just promise you won't tell.

00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,690
<14-12,Joey>好吧
<14-12,Joey>All right!

<15-1,Monica>我等不及要和你在一起了
<15-1,Monica>I can't wait to be with you.

186
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:22,920
<15-1,Monica>我告诉瑞秋我要洗几个小时的衣服
<15-1,Monica>I'll tell Rachel I'm doing laundry for a couple of hours.

187
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,490
<15-2,Chandler>洗衣服  那是我的新匿称吗
<15-2,Chandler>Laundry? Is that my new nickname?

<17-2,Joey>对  但你知道吗  谁知道什么并不重要
<17-2,Joey>Yes, but you know what? It doesn't matter who knows what.

208
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,940
<17-2,Joey>现在有足够的人知道了
<17-2,Joey>Now enough of us know,

209
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,800
<17-2,Joey>就可以告诉他们我们知道了

<17-2,Joey>谎言和秘密终于可以终结了

<17-3,Phoebe>Or we could not tell them we know

212

<17-3,Phoebe>我们可以找点小乐子

<19-6,Joey>I would've told you, but they made me promise not to tell.

226
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:37,870
<19-7,Monica>她们以为他们很厉害  竟然玩我们
<19-7,Monica>Oh, man. They think they are so slick, messing with us!

227
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:41,510
<19-7,Monica>可是  他们不知道我们已经知道他们知道
<19-7,Monica>But, see, they don't know that we know that they know.

228
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:44,680
<19-7,Monica>-所以...-对
<19-7,Monica>- So... - Ah, yes!

232
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,730
<20-2,Rachel>你开什么玩笑
<20-2,Rachel>Are you kidding?

233
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:56,890
<20-3,Phoebe>真不敢相信他会对莫妮卡这样...
<20-3,Phoebe>I can't believe he'd do that to Mo...

234
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:09,070
<20-4,Rachel>乔伊  他们知道我们知道了吗
<20-4,Rachel>Joey? Do they know that we know?

235
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,420
<19-5,Monica>-不知道  -乔伊

00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,230
<20-8,Rachel>这两个人太过分了
<20-8,Rachel>I cannot believe those two!

238
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:19,140
<20-9,Phoebe>他们以为可以耍我们
<20-9,Phoebe>They thought that they could mess with us?

239
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:21,060
<20-9,Phoebe>他们想要耍我们
<20-9,Phoebe>They're trying to mess with us?

240
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:26,650
<20-9,Phoebe>他们不知道我们知道他们知道我们知道
<20-9,Phoebe>They don't know that we know they know we know.

00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,710
<20-9,Phoebe>乔伊  你什么也不能说
<20-9,Phoebe>Joey, you can't say anything.

00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,430
<20-10,Joey>即使我想说也不知道要怎么说
<20-10,Joey>Couldn't if I wanted to.

243
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,270
<21-1,Chandler>局面完全失控了
<21-1,Chandler>This is getting out of hand!

244
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,840
<21-1,Chandler>她要我替她抹乳液
<21-1,Chandler>She wants me to put lotion on her!

245
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,380
<21-2,Monica>她那是虚张声势
<21-2,Monica>She's bluffing!

246
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,230
<21-3,Chandler>她没有退缩  她快要扑上来了
