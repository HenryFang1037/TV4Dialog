<8-6,Joey>我哪知  做慈善吗

00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:07,910
<8-11,Rachel>你喝酒怎么能帮助儿童
<8-11,Rachel>How is you drinking helping the kids?

192
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,760
<8-12,Phoebe>我喝得越多
<8-12,Phoebe>Because the more l drink,

193
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,850
<8-12,Phoebe>孩子们能喝的就越少
<8-12,Phoebe>the less there is for the kids to drink.

<8-16,Joey>Just out of curiosity, how-how much is that boat worth?

<8-17,Mr. Thompson>差不多是一万九
<8-17,Mr. Thompson>l think it was valued at 19,000.

198
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:29,770
<8-18,Joey>我猜得蛮准的
<8-18,Joey>Hey, l was pretty close.

00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:35,820
<8-18,Joey>坏消息

<8-22,Rachel>You can't leave, Joey!

205

<8-22,Rachel>你同意要买船  具有约束力
<8-22,Rachel>You agreed to buy that boat, all right?! lt's a contract.

<8-24,Rachel>we are gonna go to the next highest bidder,

210
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,890
<8-24,Rachel>然后让他们去买
<8-24,Rachel>and we are just gonna let them buy it,

211
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:17,460
<8-24,Rachel>你只要付差价
<8-24,Rachel>and then you'll pay the difference.

212
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,680
<8-27,Joey>好吧  我真不明白
<8-27,Joey>Okay. Look l don't know why the kids

<16-7,Monica>没关系  我最讨厌客人跑来致意
<16-7,Monica>Oh, that's okay I hate when people come back to compliment the chef.

358
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:55,840
<16-7,Monica>好像我很闲似的

<16-9,Monica>你就是来说这个的吗
<16-9,Monica>Did you come down here to tell me that?

363
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:10,400
<16-10,Richard>不是  我是来说别的
<16-10,Richard>No! I came here to tell you something else.

364
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:16,000
<16-10,Richard>我是来说我仍然爱你

00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:28,410
<17-2,Richard>放弃你是我所做过最蠢的事
<17-2,Richard>Letting you go was the stupidest thing l ever did.

00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,040
<17-3,Monica>你不该到厨房来的

<17-10,Richard>-你去非洲做什么  -帮助盲童
<17-10,Richard>- What did you do there? - Work with blind kids.

28
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,790
<17-12,Richard>但前提是  钱德勒也愿意给你这一切
<17-12,Richard>Only if you say Chandler's willing to give you everything l am.

72
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:09,490
<19-6,Chandler>话不能说死  不过应该是...
<19-6,Chandler>Never say never, but, you know, probably...

<19-8,Chandler>你别再搞尔虞我诈那一套了
<19-8,Chandler>Why don't you put down your copy of The Rules, huh, mantrap?

78
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,030
<19-9,Monica>你知道吗   我要走了
<19-9,Monica>You know what? l gotta go.

79

<20-3,Rachel>It would be nice to have a little guarantee though.

85
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,290
<20-4,Phoebe>什么意思
<20-4,Phoebe>What do you mean?

86
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,970
<20-5,Rachel>有些人不是会跟朋友约定
<20-5,Rachel>Well y'know, some people make deals with a friend,

87
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,190
<20-5,Rachel>要是两个人到了四十都没结婚
<20-5,Rachel>like if neither of them are married by 40,

88
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,660
<20-5,Rachel>他们就要结婚

95
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:25,280
<20-17,Rachel>你就要嫁给乔伊吗

<21-2,Monica>-莫妮卡  -你有见到瑞秋或照镜子吗
<21-2,Monica>- Hey, Monica. - Have you seen Rachel? Or a mirror?

<21-6,Monica>I’m just having one of those days

106
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,000
<21-6,Monica>这段感情是死路一条
<21-6,Monica>where you realize you're in a dead-end relationship!

107
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,170
<21-7,Joey>钱德勒欺负你是吧
<21-7,Joey>Chandler giving you a hard time huh?

<21-8,Monica>that I'm in a relationship that's actually going somewhere,

111
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,780
<21-8,Monica>而不是在原地打转  浪费时间
<21-8,Monica>that l'm not wasting time.

112
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,410
<21-9,Joey>你也了解钱德勒

00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,000
<21-9,Joey>我已经不了解钱德勒了
<21-9,Joey>No, l don't know Chandler.

114
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:25,480
<21-10,Monica>仿佛有什么事变了
<21-10,Monica>Not anymore. lt's like something's changed.

115
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:29,220
<21-11,Joey>-也许是你变了  -我才没变
<21-11,Joey>- Maybe you changed. - l didn't change.

116
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,390
<21-13,Joey>也许问题就在这里
<21-13,Joey>Maybe that's the problem.

117
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:35,960
<21-14,Monica>-什么  -钱德勒很复杂
<21-14,Monica>- What? - Chandler is a complex fellow.

118
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,860
<21-15,Joey>不太可能娶妻
<21-15,Joey>One who is unlikely to take a wife.

119
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:42,760
<21-17,Joey>他是怎么想的
<21-17,Joey>What does he think?

120
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,940
<21-18,Monica>他以为我会空等下去吗
<21-18,Monica>Does he think l'll wait around for nothing?

121
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:48,650
<21-19,Joey>面对现实吧  钱德勒反对婚姻
<21-19,Joey>Monica. Face it. Chandler is against marriage.

122
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:50,520
<21-19,Joey>他是不会变了
<21-19,Joey>And always will be.

123
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:54,660
<21-20,Monica>有些人可是真心想娶我呢
<21-20,Monica>There's some people who do wanna marry me.

124
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:57,160
<21-21,Joey>-有吗  -有  理查德
<21-21,Joey>- There are? - Yeah. Richard.

125
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:00,530
<21-22,Monica>理查德说他想娶你
<21-22,Monica>Richard said he wants to marry you?

126
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:03,520
<21-23,Joey>钱德勒说他痛恨婚姻
<21-23,Joey>And-and Chandler's tellin'ya how much he hates marriage?!

127
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,400
<21-24,Monica>没错
<21-24,Monica>That's right.

128
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:07,070
<21-25,Joey>钱德勒热爱婚姻
<21-25,Joey>Chandler loves marriage!

129
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,470
<21-26,Monica>你刚刚才说他痛恨婚姻
<21-26,Monica>You just told me that he hates marriage!

130
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:15,240
<21-26,Monica>说他很复杂  不太可能娶妻
<21-26,Monica>''He's a complex fellow who's unlikely to take a wife'' !

131
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,400
<21-27,Joey>说他会永远反对婚姻
<21-27,Joey>''He's against marriage and always will be'' !

132
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,220
<21-27,Joey>你就这么解读我的话啊
<21-27,Joey>You got that from what l said?

133
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:30,290
<22-4,Rachel>-瑞秋  -帅哥
<22-4,Rachel>- Rach. - Hey, you.

<22-5,Ross>- Come on in. - Thank you.

135
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:37,090
<22-6,Rachel>很遗撼你跟伊丽莎白分手了
<22-6,Rachel>You know, l'm so sorry to hear about you and Elizabeth.

136
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:41,390
<22-7,Ross>谢谢  我以为我们能克服万难  不过...
<22-7,Ross>Thanks. l really thought we'd be able to make it work.

137
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:43,790
<22-7,Ross>这大概是有缘无分吧
<22-7,Ross>l guess it wasn't meant to be.

138
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:48,400
<22-8,Rachel>是啊  爱情...爱情真是微妙
<22-8,Rachel>Yeah. Love. lt's a tricky business, isn't it?

139
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,470
<22-10,Rachel>-是啊  -我们要不要来做个约定
<22-10,Rachel>- l guess so. - So, what do you say we make a pact?

140
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:57,150
<22-10,Rachel>要是我们到了四十都还没结婚  我们就结婚
<22-10,Rachel>lf you and l are both single by 40, we get married.

141
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:00,510
<22-10,Rachel>我们互相认识  互相喜欢
<22-10,Rachel>l mean, we know each other, we like each other...

00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,510
<22-10,Rachel>我们已经上过床
<22-10,Rachel>...we've already slept together,

143
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,750
<22-10,Rachel>不会有惊讶的地方
<22-10,Rachel>so there'll be no surprises there. You know what I mean?

144
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:06,680
<22-10,Rachel>不会有什么"哇靠"
<22-10,Rachel>No, like, ''What's that?''

145
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,180
<22-11,Ross>-你想找我当备胎  -没错
<22-11,Ross>- Oh, you want me to be your backup. - Exactly.

146
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,590
<22-13,Ross>我已经有备胎了
<22-13,Ross>Yeah. l already have one.

00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,470
<22-14,Rachel>-是谁  -菲比
<22-14,Rachel>- What? Who? - Phoebe.

148
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,190
<22-15,Ross>菲比
<22-15,Ross>Phoebe?

149
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:24,570
<22-16,Rachel>但是她说乔伊是她的备胎
<22-16,Rachel>But she just said Joey is her backup.

150
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:26,940
<22-17,Ross>才不是呢
<22-17,Ross>Oh, l don't think so.

151
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,760
<22-18,Rachel>我刚跟她聊过  她说她和乔伊约好了
<22-18,Rachel>Ross. We just spoke. She said that she and Joey made a deal.

152
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,030
<22-19,Ross>不可能的  我们早就约好了
<22-19,Ross>That's impossible. I mean we have had a deal for years.

153
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,250
<22-19,Ross>还握手为定
<22-19,Ross>We shook on it.

154
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,470
<22-19,Ross>不过我可以告诉你  她想要的不只是那样呢
<22-19,Ross>although believe me she wanted to do a lot more than that.

155
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:46,710
<23-1,Joey>你上哪儿去了
<23-1,Joey>Where the hell have you been?!
