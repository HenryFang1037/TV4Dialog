<1-2,Ross>-嘿  -嗯  好啦  当然
<1-2,Ross>- Hey.  - Yeah. Yeah, okay. Sure.

2
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:07,690
<1-2,Ross>我们能不能谈谈
<1-2,Ross>Look, can we talk about

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,060
<1-2,Ross>昨晚这里的发生的事
<1-2,Ross>what happened here last night?

4
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:10,490
<1-3,Chandler>行  先给我几秒钟
<1-3,Chandler>Sure. Just give me a second

5
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,310
<1-3,Chandler>让我进入你那愤怒又诡异的状态
<1-3,Chandler>to get all huffy and weird like you.

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,260
<1-3,Chandler>你敢相信某某人在昨天晚在这
<1-3,Chandler>You believe that whoever did something last night

7
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:18,530
<1-3,Chandler>做了某某事要么没做某某事  有没有搞错
<1-3,Chandler>did what they did or didn't do? Come on!

8
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:22,670
<1-4,Ross>你真不了解我说的是什么
<1-4,Ross>Okay, you really don't know what I'm talking about?

9
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,450
<1-5,Chandler>-不知道  -好  昨天晚上的派对之后
<1-5,Chandler>- No.  - Okay. Last night, after the party...

10
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,100
<1-6,Ross>我看到瑞秋在你家的阳台上
<1-6,Ross>I saw Rachel kissing that jerk

11
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:28,990
<1-6,Ross>亲她那个混蛋同事
<1-6,Ross>from her office out on your balcony.

12
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,710
<1-7,Chandler>在我家阳台  真的吗
<1-7,Chandler>Our balcony? Seriously?

13
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,530
<1-7,Chandler>这可好玩了  我就和莫妮卡说
<1-7,Chandler>That's so funny. I told Monica

14
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,260
<1-7,Chandler>我们应该在阳台上加个灯的
<1-7,Chandler>we should put lights on our balcony

15
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:36,210
<1-7,Chandler>可她说不用  外面那么冷  没人会去
<1-7,Chandler>and she said, ''No, no. It's too cold.

16
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:37,970
<1-7,Chandler>然后我说
<1-7,Chandler>Nobody will go out there.'' And I said:

17
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:40,240
<1-7,Chandler>要是我们加个灯或许就有人会去了
<1-7,Chandler>'Maybe if we put some lights out there they will.

18
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:45,000
<1-8,Ross>对  我过来就是要和你谈这事
<1-8,Ross>Right, that's what I came over to talk about.

19
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:46,940
<1-8,Ross>我看到瑞秋在你家阳台上亲了一个男人
<1-8,Ross>I saw Rachel kissing some guy.

20
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:49,930
<1-8,Ross>虽然那里连灯都没有
<1-8,Ross>on your balcony, even though there were no lights!

21
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:54,360
<1-9,Chandler>那你要跟她谈谈吗
<1-9,Chandler>So are you gonna talk to her?

22
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,110
<1-10,Ross>为什么  为什么我要
<1-10,Ross>Why? Why should I?

23
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,500
<1-10,Ross>如果她要找寻新生活  没关系
<1-10,Ross>I mean, if she wants to move on, that's fine.

24
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:00,320
<1-11,Chandler>这么说没关系  真有说服力
<1-11,Chandler>You know when ''that's fine'' sounds true?

25
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:02,510
<1-11,Chandler>喷着口水用力吼
<1-11,Chandler>When someone yells it and spits.

26
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,400
<1-9,Chandler>不  我认真的
<1-9,Chandler>No, I'm serious.

27
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:06,470
<1-10,Ross>如果她想要跟别人约会
<1-10,Ross>I mean, if she wants to date people,

28
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,010
<1-12,Ross>没关系  我不在乎
<1-12,Ross>fine. I don't care.

29
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:10,250
<1-12,Ross>但是至少她要跟我说啊
<1-12,Ross>But at least she could have told me.

30
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,310
<1-12,Ross>我已经完全不顾个人生活
<1-12,Ross>You know, I've been putting my life on hold

31
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,780
<1-12,Ross>集中全部精力在艾玛身上了
<1-12,Ross>and concentrating on Emma.

32
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:16,700
<1-12,Ross>但如果她想要出去随便亲男人
<1-12,Ross>But if she wants to go out there kissing guys

33
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:19,280
<1-12,Ross>那我也要去
<1-12,Ross>she barely knows, then so will I.

34
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,740
<1-12,Ross>真好笑  罗斯是同志
<1-12,Ross>Very funny! Ross is gay!

35
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,520
<1-13,Chandler>没  很好  所以你也要有新的生活了
<1-13,Chandler>No, no. Good, so you're moving on.

36
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:30,990
<1-13,Chandler>你准备怎么过新生活
<1-13,Chandler>Do you have any idea where you're moving on to?

37
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,130
<1-13,Chandler>我机会多的很呢
<1-13,Chandler>I've got plenty of opportunities.

38
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,540
<1-14,Ross>就刚刚在咖啡厅里  有个女人对我笑呢
<1-14,Ross>Just now, there was some woman at the coffeehouse smiled at me.

39
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:40,550
<1-14,Ross>还有一天在地铁  有个女人
<1-14,Ross>And then the other day on the subway, a woman

40
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,690
<1-14,Ross>不小心  坐到我的手上了
<1-14,Ross>''accidentally'' sat on my hand.

41
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:47,740
<1-15,Chandler>老兄  别跟我炫耀你疯狂的单身生活了
<1-15,Chandler>Dude, don't rub my face in your crazy single life.

42
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:53,110
<1-16,Ross>还有  在学校有个人类学家
<1-16,Ross>And there's an anthropologist at school who totally came on to me

43
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,430
<1-16,Ross>跨部门餐会的时候 不停勾搭我
<1-16,Ross>during the interdepartmental potluck dinner.

44
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,690
<1-17,Chandler>我为什么要结婚啊
<1-17,Chandler>Why did I get married?

60
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:50,840
<2-1,Joey>问你们一个问题
<2-1,Joey>Hey, let me ask you guys something.

61
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,980
<2-1,Joey>我明天要拍新艺术照
<2-1,Joey>I'm having new headshots taken tomorrow.

62
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,920
<2-1,Joey>摄影师说
<2-1,Joey>The photographer said she thinks

63
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,700
<2-1,Joey>我应该修修眉毛
<2-1,Joey>I should have my eyebrows waxed.

64
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,890
<2-1,Joey>男生修眉会不会很怪
<2-1,Joey>Is that weird for a guy?

65
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,350
<2-2,Phoebe>-嗯  那要看情况  -什么情况
<2-2,Phoebe>- Well, it depends.  - On?

66
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,280
<2-4,Phoebe>看他的变性手术做到哪个阶段了
<2-4,Phoebe>On how far along he is in the sex-change process.

67
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,510
<2-5,Monica>不  我完全不同意
<2-5,Monica>No, I totally disagree.

68
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,080
<2-5,Monica>我觉得男生那样做没有什么
<2-5,Monica>I think it's fine for a guy to do something like that.

69
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:12,530
<2-5,Monica>尤其是演员
<2-5,Monica>Especially an actor.

70
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,990
<2-5,Monica>我不是说你有那个必要  你的眉毛…
<2-5,Monica>I mean, not that you need to. Your eyebrows are....

71
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:22,500
<2-6,Joey>你们别这样  别盯着我看  吓着我了
<2-6,Joey>Stop it, you guys. Stop staring, you're freaking me out.

72
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,260
<2-7,Phoebe>你手指头也毛茸茸的
<2-7,Phoebe>Your knuckles are kind of hairy too.

73
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,650
<2-8,Joey>天啊  现在我还要除这些毛吗
<2-8,Joey>Oh, man, now I have to get those done too?

74
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,380
<2-9,Phoebe>哇  你要做的改造可不少啊
<2-9,Phoebe>Wow, talk about high maintenance.

75
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,140
<2-10,Joey>你还不是染发
<2-10,Joey>You dye your hair.

76
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:36,130
<2-11,Phoebe>-我是女人啊  -双重标准
<2-11,Phoebe>- I'm a woman.  - Double standards!

77
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:40,830
<2-13,Phoebe>差点忘记 你今晚去迈克的钢琴酒吧吗
<2-13,Phoebe>Before I forget, are you coming to Mike's piano bar tonight?

78
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,600
<2-14,Monica>只要不让我上台唱歌就去
<2-14,Monica>Only if I don't have to get up and sing.

79
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:45,040
<2-15,Phoebe>但是大家都要唱歌啊  很好玩的
<2-15,Phoebe>But everybody sings. It's so fun.

80
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:47,700
<2-15,Phoebe>上次有个可爱的老先生上台
<2-15,Phoebe>Last time, this adorable old man got up there,

81
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,500
<2-15,Phoebe>歌词全忘了  糗呆了
<2-15,Phoebe>forgot all the words, flipped out

82
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:53,610
<2-15,Phoebe>然后大家就嘘他下台  太好玩了
<2-15,Phoebe>and everyone booed him off the stage. It was so funny.

83
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:57,110
<2-16,Monica>我不是很会唱歌
<2-16,Monica>Look, I'm not good at singing.

84
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,620
<2-17,Phoebe>怎么啦  你害怕了
<2-17,Phoebe>Oh, what's the matter? You scared?

85
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:59,820
<2-17,Phoebe>怕我唱的比你好吗
<2-17,Phoebe>You afraid I'm a better singer?

86
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,840
<2-17,Phoebe>怕我会用歌声把你打得落花流水
<2-17,Phoebe>You afraid I'm gonna beat you at singing?

87
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,160
<2-18,Monica>不是  这招对我没用
<2-18,Monica>Nope. Nope. It's not working on me.

88
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:12,390
<2-18,Monica>哇  我一定是长大了
<2-18,Monica>Wow, I must be growing up.

89
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:17,890
<2-19,Phoebe>好吧  就过来支持迈克就好了
<2-19,Phoebe>Okay, fine. Just please come and support Mike.

90
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,160
<2-19,Phoebe>你不需要唱歌
<2-19,Phoebe>You don't have to sing.

91
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:20,830
<2-20,Monica>所以我又不用唱歌
<2-20,Monica>So I don't have to sing,

92
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,540
<2-20,Monica>而且还可以坐在那里评论别人
<2-20,Monica>and I can just sit there and pass judgment on others?

93
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:25,820
<2-21,Phoebe>-还可以一边喝酒  -我要去
<2-21,Phoebe>- While drinking.  - I'm there.

<2-22,Monica>你们好 我需要你们的帮忙
<2-22,Monica>Hi, you guys. Listen, I really need your help.

95
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,750
<2-23,Rachel>我想我做了一件很蠢的事
<2-23,Rachel>I think I did something really stupid.

96
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,400
<2-24,Phoebe>是  瑞秋  但至少结果还是很漂亮的
<2-24,Phoebe>Well, yes, Rachel, but you got something so beautiful out of it.

97
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,880
<2-25,Rachel>不  不是那件事  我昨晚亲了盖文
<2-25,Rachel>No, not that. I kissed Gavin last night.

98
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:44,290
<2-27,Monica>-我的天  -你亲了他
<2-27,Monica>- My God.  -You kissed him?

99
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:47,090
<2-28,Rachel>对  就在派对结束之后 我们在阳台上
<2-28,Rachel>Yeah, it was after the party, we were on the balcony

100
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,400
<2-29,Monica>等等  我一直都在家
<2-29,Monica>Wait, wait, wait. I was at home the whole time.

101
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:50,510
<2-29,Monica>为什么没看到
<2-29,Monica>How did I miss that?

102
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,870
<2-30,Phoebe>派对才刚结束 你可能正忙着烫平包装纸
<2-30,Phoebe>Well, it was the end of the party. You were probably ironing wrapping paper.

103
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:56,750
<2-30,Phoebe>哦  没错
<2-30,Phoebe>Oh, yeah.

104
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:01,830
<2-31,Monica>那你们怎么会亲起来的呢
<2-31,Monica>So how did you end up kissing?

105
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,630
<2-32,Rachel>我们单独在一起  然后他又很体贴
<2-32,Rachel>We were all alone and he was being really nice...

106
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,610
<2-32,Rachel>然后又送我这条围巾
<2-32,Rachel>and he gave me this scarf.

107
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:07,900
<2-33,Monica>我以为你讨厌他
<2-33,Monica>I thought you hated him.

108
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:10,850
<2-34,Rachel>看来爱与恨之间只有一线之隔
<2-34,Rachel>Well, there is a thin line between love and hate...

109
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:14,640
<2-34,Rachel>而结果  那条线就是这围巾
<2-34,Rachel>...and it turns out that line is a scarf.

110
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:19,980
<2-35,Monica>你想要跟这男的交往吗
<2-35,Monica>Are you thinking of starting something up with this guy?

111
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:23,060
<2-36,Rachel>不知道  太复杂了  我和他一起工作
<2-36,Rachel>I don't know. lt's so complicated. I work with this guy.

112
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:25,380
<2-36,Rachel>我已经有小孩  还有罗斯
<2-36,Rachel>I have the baby, and I have Ross.

113
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:27,120
<2-36,Rachel>我不知道该怎么办
<2-36,Rachel>I don't know what to do.

114
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:30,340
<2-36,Rachel>而我再十分钟就要进办公室见到盖文了
<2-36,Rachel>And I have to be at the office and see Gavin in 10 minutes.

115
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,570
<2-37,Monica>听起来你应该想想
<2-37,Monica>Sounds like you need to think about

116
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:34,320
<2-37,Monica>要怎么跟盖文说了
<2-37,Monica>what you want and talk to Gavin.

117
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:36,650
<2-37,Monica>而且你一定得要跟罗斯谈谈
<2-37,Monica>And you definitely should talk to Ross.

118
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:37,260
<2-37,Monica>或者…
<2-37,Monica>Or...

119
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,100
<2-38,Rachel>我可以打电话请病假  那就都不用管了
<2-38,Rachel>...I could call in sick and not deal with it at all.

120
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:46,120
<2-39,Phoebe>请了五个月的产假  才回去上了四天班
<2-39,Phoebe>Wow! Five months maternity leave, you're back for four days...

121
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:48,080
<2-39,Phoebe>亲了一个同事  又要请病假
<2-39,Phoebe>kiss a co-worker and call in sick.

122
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:50,130
<2-39,Phoebe>他们有你这个员工真幸运

00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:06,460
<3-7,Sonia>让我来处理
<3-7,Sonia>I'll take care of it.

133
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,280
<3-6,Joey>谢谢
<3-6,Joey>Thanks.

134
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:16,160
<3-8,Joey>来你们… 你们这里的男生多吗
<3-8,Joey>So do you...? Do you get a lot of guys in here?

135
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:19,110
<3-9,Sonia>-当然  -太好了
<3-9,Sonia>- Oh, absolutely.  - Oh, good.

136

<3-11,Sonia>你想认识认识吗
<3-11,Sonia>You looking to meet somebody?

137
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:22,410
<3-12,Joey>好了  我们开始吧
<3-12,Joey>All right, let's just do this.

138
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:26,880
<3-13,Sonia>好的  我们等一下再上热蜡
<3-13,Sonia>Okay, we'll get to the wax in a minute.

139
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:29,670
<3-13,Sonia>首先我要先拔一些杂毛  好吗
<3-13,Sonia>First, I want to tweeze some of the strays, okay?

140
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,020
<3-13,Sonia>这可能会有点痛
<3-13,Sonia>Now, this may sting just a little bit.

141
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,900
<3-14,Joey>你随意  我可是一点都不怕痛的
<3-14,Joey>Please, I have an extremely high threshold

142
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:37,840
<3-14,Joey>妈妈咪啊   喔  我的脸  我的脸
<3-14,Joey>Holy Mother of God! Oh, my face! My face!

143
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:46,240
<3-14,Joey>我没事  我没事  我没事
<3-14,Joey>I'm all right. I'm all right. I'm all right.

144
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:49,680
<3-14,Joey>只是有点吓到  没什么
<3-14,Joey>It's just a bit of shock, that's all.

145
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:53,170
<3-14,Joey>-但是我没事  你可以继续了 -好的
<3-14,Joey>- But I'll be fine. You can go again.   - Okay.

146
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,240
<3-14,Joey>抱歉
<3-14,Joey>Sorry.

147
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:06,860
<3-14,Joey>可恶  你这女人
<3-14,Joey>Damn it, woman!

148
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:22,680
<4-1,Chandler>全纽约最适合结婚的单身汉来了
<4-1,Chandler>It's the most eligible man in New York.

149
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,300
<4-1,Chandler>新生活进行得如何呢
<4-1,Chandler>How's the moving on going?

150
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:30,070
<4-2,Ross>不太好  地铁上又有个人坐到我的手
<4-2,Ross>Not well. I went on the subway again and someone did sit on my hand...

151
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,230
<4-2,Ross>但是这个人既不是女性 也没有穿内裤
<4-2,Ross>but that person was neither female nor wearing pants.

152
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,540
<4-3,Chandler>或许你完全错估情势了  我是说你想想看
<4-3,Chandler>Maybe you're going about this the wrong way. I mean, think about it:

153
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:42,160
<4-3,Chandler>单身白种男性  离婚三次
<4-3,Chandler>Single white male, divorced three times,

154
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:44,020
<4-3,Chandler>有两个非婚生子女
<4-3,Chandler>two illegitimate children.

155
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:48,140
<4-3,Chandler>你应该要自己心里有数的
<4-3,Chandler>The personal ad writes itself.

156
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,340
<4-4,Ross>真是好笑  是啊
<4-4,Ross>You know, that's funny. Yeah.

157
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:53,700
<4-4,Ross>那你觉得你这辈子会找到工作吗
<4-4,Ross>So do you think you'll ever work again?

158
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:58,180
<4-5,Chandler>你在干嘛   你知道我们会斗个没完的
<4-5,Chandler>What are you doing? You know I can only dish it out.

159
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:02,050
<4-6,Ross>我不敢相信瑞秋就这样抛下过去
<4-6,Ross>I can't believe Rachel just moved on

160
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,040
<4-6,Ross>而且还什么都没有跟我说
<4-6,Ross>and didn't say anything to me.

161
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:05,550
<4-7,Chandler>或许她并没有抛下
<4-7,Chandler>Maybe she didn't move on.

162
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,930
<4-7,Chandler>或许那只是冲动之下吻的
<4-7,Chandler>Maybe that kiss was just an impulsive,

163
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,800
<4-7,Chandler>过生日才发生一次的那种
<4-7,Chandler>one-time birthday thing.

164
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,100
<4-8,Ross>不  一个月以前  她还把电话号码
<4-8,Ross>No, a month ago,

165
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,760
<4-8,Ross>留给一个在酒吧认识的男的
<4-8,Ross>she gave her number to some guy in a bar.

166
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:13,830
<4-9,Chandler>她有跟他出去吗
<4-9,Chandler>Did she go out with him?

167
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:14,950
<4-10,Ross>没有  他打电话来时
<4-10,Ross>No. When he called

168
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:16,640
<4-10,Ross>我把留言扔了
<4-10,Ross>I threw the message away.

169
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,690
<4-11,Chandler>真是厉害啊
<4-11,Chandler>The high road.

170
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:22,400
<4-12,Ross>你知道吗  够了
<4-12,Ross>All right, you know what? Enough.

171
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:25,150
<4-12,Ross>抱怨够了  我要展开新生活了
<4-12,Ross>Enough talking. I have to get moving.

172
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:30,970
<4-12,Ross>瞧瞧那两个金发美女  跟我一起过去
<4-12,Ross>Hey, check out those two blonds over there. Hey, come with me.

173
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:33,550
<4-13,Chandler>你要害每个人都离婚吗
<4-13,Chandler>Are you trying to get everybody divorced?

174
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,240
<4-13,Chandler>不是让你真泡妞
<4-13,Chandler>You don't have to do anything.

175
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:37,970
<4-14,Ross>但是我们两个一起过去会比较好
<4-14,Ross>It'll just be easier if it's two of us.

176
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,880
<4-14,Ross>就像大学一样  记得吗
<4-14,Ross>Like college, remember?

177
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:42,670
<4-14,Ross>你先过去说笑话热场面
<4-14,Ross>First, you break the ice with some kind of a joke

178
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,950
<4-14,Ross>让她们知道你是好玩的人
<4-14,Ross>so they know you're the funny one.

179
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,830
<4-14,Ross>然后我再插入有趣的话题
<4-14,Ross>I swoop in with interesting conversation...

180
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,080
<4-14,Ross>让她们知又道我才是既聪明  有教养还性感
<4-14,Ross>so they'll see that I'm the brilliant, brooding, sexy one.

181
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:56,100
<4-15,Chandler>我还以为笑话都是我来讲
<4-15,Chandler>I thought I got to make the jokes.

182
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,570
<4-16,Ross>你不用上班吗
<4-16,Ross>Don't you have to be at work?

183
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:00,480
<4-17,Chandler>拜托  走吧
<4-17,Chandler>Oh, come on.

184
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:07,400
<4-17,Chandler>你们好  我叫钱德勒

186
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,710
<4-19,Blonde girl>我们在想
<4-19,Blonde girl>We were wondering

187
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,910
<4-17,Chandler>如果你们加入
<4-17,Chandler>if you're up for it,

188
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,880
<4-17,Chandler>我们就只差六个人来玩人体金字塔了
<4-17,Chandler>we only need six more people for a human pyramid.

189
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:18,510
<4-17,Chandler>接手  接手
<4-17,Chandler>Swoop. Swoop.

190
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,420
<4-18,Ross>我注意到你在看报纸
<4-18,Ross>Hey, I notice you're reading the paper.

191
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:29,100
<4-18,Ross>欧洲又有水灾了  对吗
<4-18,Ross>Another flood in Europe, huh?

192
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,970
<4-18,Ross>问你们个问题
<4-18,Ross>Here's a question:

193
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:39,380
<4-18,Ross>你宁愿被淹死还是被活活烧死
<4-18,Ross>Would you rather drown or be burned alive?

194
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:45,330
<4-19,Blonde girl>-很抱歉  我们要走了  -好的
<4-19,Blonde girl>- I'm sorry, we're just leaving. - Okay.

195
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,740
<4-20,Chandler>宝刀未老
<4-20,Chandler>We still got it.

196
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,780
<5-1,Rachel>谁
<5-1,Rachel>Who is it?

197
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:03,320
<5-2,Gavin>盖文  我带一些汤来给你
<5-2,Gavin>Gavin. I brought you some soup.

198
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,670
<5-4,Gavin>-为什么   -我听说你生病了
<5-4,Gavin>- Why? - I heard you were sick.

<5-5,Rachel>喔  对  等一下 让我先整理一下
<5-5,Rachel>Oh, right! Hold on, let me just clean up in here a little bit.

<5-5,Rachel>你好  盖文

<5-6,Gavin>今天上班好想你  你还好吗
<5-6,Gavin>I missed you at work. How you feeling?

202
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:29,320
<5-7,Rachel>不想对你说谎  我病得很重
<5-7,Rachel>I'm not gonna lie to you, I'm pretty sick.

203
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:33,780
<5-8,Gavin>那就好  因为我还担心
<5-8,Gavin>Oh, good. Because I was having a totally paranoid moment

204
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:36,040
<5-8,Gavin>你是在装病逃避我
<5-8,Gavin>where I thought you called in sick to avoid me.

205
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:38,420
<5-9,Rachel>不是  不是
<5-9,Rachel>Oh, no, no, no.

<5-12,Gavin>你的病到底传染性有多高呢
<5-12,Gavin>Exactly how contagious is this thing you have?

209
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:53,690
<5-12,Gavin>是因为站在阳台上受凉了
<5-12,Gavin>Is it a cold from standing on the balcony,

210
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,910
<5-12,Gavin>还是被猴子咬了呢
<5-12,Gavin>or did a monkey bite you?

211
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,960
<5-13,Rachel>-只是单纯的感冒  -有发烧吗
<5-13,Rachel>- It's just a cold.  - Do you have a fever?

<5-16,Gavin>那张照片  罗斯在对你做什么
<5-16,Gavin>What's Ross doing to you in that picture?

215
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,610
<5-17,Rachel>他在用化石刷子帮我除尘
<5-17,Rachel>Oh, he's dusting me with a fossil brush.

216
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,520
<5-17,Rachel>他觉得那样很好玩
<5-17,Rachel>He thought it would be funny.

<5-17,Rachel>-是啊  -是的

<5-19,Rachel>别担心罗斯
<5-19,Rachel>Don't worry about Ross.

<5-21,Rachel>躲到窗廉后面

<5-23,Rachel>-嗨  -是莫莉啊  不是罗斯

<5-24,Molly>不是  我来接艾玛到你妈家  记得吗
<5-24,Molly>No. I'm here to take Emma to your mother's, remember?

232
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,200
<5-27,Rachel>有个男人藏在你家窗帘后头
<5-27,Rachel>There is a man behind your curtain.

233
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,050
<5-28,Molly>我皮包里有防狼喷雾
<5-28,Molly>I have Mace in my purse.

<5-29,Rachel>那是我同事盖文在发神经
<5-29,Rachel>This is my business associate Gavin being silly.

00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:08,380
<5-29,Rachel>出来吧  别站那
<5-29,Rachel>Come out from behind there.

<5-30,Gavin>你好  我叫盖文  很高兴认识你
<5-30,Gavin>Hi. Gavin. Pleased to meet you.

238
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:16,100
<5-30,Gavin>是我要站在那里的
<5-30,Gavin>It was my idea to stand there.

239
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,560
<5-31,Molly>-你好  我去带艾玛  -好的
<5-31,Molly>- Hello. I'll just go get Emma.  - Okay.

<5-32,Rachel>那么…
<5-32,Rachel>So...

241
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:28,350
<5-33,Gavin>为什么我要躲呢
<5-33,Gavin>why did I have to hide?

242
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,050
<5-34,Rachel>我以为那是罗斯
<5-34,Rachel>I thought it was Ross.

243
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,090
<5-35,Gavin>如果真是又如何
<5-35,Gavin>So what if it was?

244
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:32,820
<5-35,Gavin>我以为你们之间已经没有什么了
<5-35,Gavin>I thought there was nothing going on between you.

245
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:35,080
<5-36,Rachel>是没有  完全没有
<5-36,Rachel>There isn't. There totally isn't.

246
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:36,470
<5-37,Gavin>你听到钥匙转动的声音
<5-37,Gavin>You hear keys in the hall

247
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,690
<5-37,Gavin>就像斗牛第一次出栏一样跳了起来
<5-37,Gavin>and you jump like a bronco coming out of the chute for the first time.

248
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,550
<5-37,Gavin>我做过牛仔小丑
<5-37,Gavin>I used to be a rodeo clown.

00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,760
<5-38,Rachel>我觉得是  你在这里让我有罪恶感
<5-38,Rachel>I guess I felt guilty that you were here

251
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,430
<5-38,Rachel>我也不想的
<5-38,Rachel>which I shouldn't.

252
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:01,520
<5-38,Rachel>罗斯跟我没又有在交往
<5-38,Rachel>You know, Ross and I are not in a relationship

253
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:05,910
<5-38,Rachel>但他是我孩子的父亲  而且我们住在一起
<5-38,Rachel>but he is the father of my child. And, you know

254
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:10,560
<5-38,Rachel>再加上  我们有太多过去了
<5-38,Rachel>we do live together. And plus, there's just so much history, you know?

255
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:12,910
<5-38,Rachel>只是…  我不知道
<5-38,Rachel>It's just-- I don't know.

256
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,630
<5-38,Rachel>我很抱歉  脑子很乱
<5-38,Rachel>I'm sorry. I'm just all over the place.

257
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:16,460
<5-38,Rachel>没关系
<5-38,Rachel>It's okay.

258
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:19,490
<5-39,Gavin>这或许与我无关
<5-39,Gavin>It's probably not my place,

259
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,160
<5-39,Gavin>但是我可以给你一个建议吗
<5-39,Gavin>but can I give you a piece of advice?

261
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,750
<5-41,Gavin>你应该跟罗斯谈谈这件事
<5-41,Gavin>I think you should talk to Ross about all this.

<5-42,Rachel>大家都这样说
<5-42,Rachel>People keep saying that.

<5-43,Gavin>Don't be.

265
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,000
<5-43,Gavin>只是现在不是好时机
<5-43,Gavin>It's just bad timing.

266
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,220
<5-44,Rachel>讲真的吗  牛仔小丑
<5-44,Rachel>So seriously, rodeo clown?

365
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:25,280
<11-1,Michelle>公共厕所让我觉得很恶
<11-1,Michelle>Public bathrooms freak me out.

<11-1,Michelle>我根本尿不出来  更别说其他的
<11-1,Michelle>I can't even pee, let alone do anything else.

00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:30,880
<11-2,Ross>但是更棒的是  你居然不介意说出来

371
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:45,580
<11-5,Michelle>你不用担心  这不是备胎疗伤法
<11-5,Michelle>No, don't worry. This is not some rebound thing.

372
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:47,790
<11-5,Michelle>我对艾瑞克已经完全没感觉了
<11-5,Michelle>I am totally over Eric.

<14-30,Ross>-那个酒吧认识的男的呢  -谁
<14-30,Ross>- What about the guy from the bar?  - Who?

479
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:39,930
<14-31,Rachel>你给他电话号码的那一个
<14-31,Rachel>The guy you gave your number to.

480
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:43,370
<14-33,Rachel>你是怎么知道的
<14-33,Rachel>How do you know about that?

481
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,290
<14-34,Ross>因为他打来找你
<14-34,Ross>Because he called here looking for you.

482
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:50,040
<14-34,Ross>所以别跟我说  你只是亲了一次男同事
<14-34,Ross>So don't tell me kissing this guy from work is a one-time thing.

483
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:53,240
<14-34,Ross>因为你又在酒吧  又在阳台上
<14-34,Ross>Because you've been out there in bars and on balconies

484
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:54,600
<14-34,Ross>已经一个多月了
<14-34,Ross>for over a month now.

485
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:56,840
<14-34,Ross>你都没有礼貌性和我说一声
<14-34,Ross>And you don't even have the courtesy to tell me.

486
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:01,160
<14-35,Rachel>-为什么我没有拿到留言  -什么
<14-35,Rachel>- Why didn't I get that message?  - What?

<14-37,Rachel>那个酒吧男的留言  为什么我没有拿到留言
<14-37,Rachel>From the guy in the bar? Why didn't I get that message?

488
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:08,610
<14-38,Ross>因为我折起来放到裤子口袋里了
<14-38,Ross>Because I folded it up and put it in my pants pocket.

489
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:11,000
<14-38,Ross>你没有去找过吗
<14-38,Ross>Do you not look there?

490
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,730
<14-39,Rachel>罗斯

<14-43,Rachel>天啊  你知道吗  我不
<14-43,Rachel>Oh, God, you know what? I don't

495
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:29,720
<14-43,Rachel>你以为你是谁呢  你有什么权利决定
<14-43,Rachel>Who do you think you are? Who are you to decide

496
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:32,840
<14-43,Rachel>什么留言我该收  什么不该收
<14-43,Rachel>what messages I should or should not get?!

<14-44,Ross>- Who am I?  -Yes

498
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:36,090
<14-46,Ross>我是在你去酒吧认识男人的时候
<14-46,Ross>I'm the guy who's taking care of our baby...

499
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:38,210
<14-46,Ross>在家照顾我们的孩子的人
<14-46,Ross>while you're at bars meeting guys!

500
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:39,250
<14-46,Ross>我真不敢相信
<14-46,Ross>I cannot believe you.

501
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:43,930
<14-47,Rachel>我还希望能够跟你  成熟地谈谈我们之间
<14-47,Rachel>I actually came in here hoping to have a mature conversation with you about us.

502
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:46,620
<14-47,Rachel>但我不能跟会藏我留言
<14-47,Rachel>But I can't do that with someone who hides my messages

503
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:49,320
<14-47,Rachel>还会带疯女人回我公寓的人谈
<14-47,Rachel>and brings crazy women back to my apartment!

504
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:52,790
<14-48,Ross>正常的人没有一个要跟我回来
<14-48,Ross>Hey, none of the sane ones wanted to come back with me!

505
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:59,910
<14-48,Ross>这不是重点好吗  重点是
<14-48,Ross>That's not the point, okay? The point is

506
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:03,870
<14-48,Ross>是你抛下我们的过去  而你却没有说
<14-48,Ross>you are the one who moved on and didn't tell anyone.

507
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:06,950
<14-49,Rachel>天啊  罗斯  这真是糟透了
<14-49,Rachel>Oh, God, Ross, this is just so messed up.

508
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:09,960
<14-49,Rachel>我们是怎么了
<14-49,Rachel>What is wrong with us?

509
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:12,480
<14-49,Rachel>大家知道我们的情况后  都会问
<14-49,Rachel>When people hear about our situation, they ask:

510
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:14,560
<14-49,Rachel>你们住在一起  还不是夫妻
<14-49,Rachel>''You live together, but you're not a couple,

511
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:16,630
<14-49,Rachel>但是你们又有小孩  不是很奇怪吗
<14-49,Rachel>yet you have a baby? Isn't that weird?''

512
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:20,110
<14-49,Rachel>我会说  不会  我们都没问题
<14-49,Rachel>And I say, ''No. It's not, because it works for us.''

513
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,890
<14-49,Rachel>但是你知道吗  是有问题的
<14-49,Rachel>But you know what? This doesn't work.

514
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,760
<14-49,Rachel>事实上  还正好相反咧
<14-49,Rachel>ln fact, this is the opposite of working.

515
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,780
<14-50,Ross>的确如此
<14-50,Ross>Clearly.

516
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,430
<14-51,Rachel>你也知道
<14-51,Rachel>And you know...

517
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:32,860
<14-51,Rachel>我们有说过只要一切没问题
<14-51,Rachel>we said that we would live together

518
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:34,040
<14-51,Rachel>我们就会一直住在一起
<14-51,Rachel>as long as this makes sense

519
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:37,670
<14-51,Rachel>然而  或许一切不再是没问题了
<14-51,Rachel>and maybe this just doesn't make sense anymore.

520
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:41,140
<14-52,Ross>是啊  或许不再是了
<14-52,Ross>Yeah, maybe not.

521
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,940
<14-52,Ross>那你想要怎样呢
<14-52,Ross>So, what do you wanna do?

522
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,440
<15-1,Joey>嗨
<15-1,Joey>Hi.

523
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:54,590
<15-2,Rachel>我跟艾玛可以过来住一阵子吗
<15-2,Rachel>Can Emma and I live here for a while?

524
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:57,440
<15-2,Rachel>天啊
<15-2,Rachel>God.

525
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,590
<15-3,Joey>-当然可以  -谢谢你
<15-3,Joey>- Of course.  - Thank you.

526
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:09,020
<15-5,Joey>你眉毛好奇怪
<15-5,Joey>Your eyebrows look weird.

527
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:20,620
<15-5,Joey>耶利米书是只牛蛙
<15-5,Joey>"Jeremiah was a bullfrog.

528
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:24,830
<16-1,Chandler>它曾是我的好友
<16-1,Chandler>Was a good friend of mine,

529
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,920
<16-1,Chandler>它的话我不曾听懂
<16-1,Chandler>never understood a single word he said,

530
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:33,010
<16-1,Chandler>但我帮他喝了他的酒
<16-1,Chandler>but I helped him drink his wine."

531
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,170
<16-1,Chandler>所以不管怎样  你都会自摸
<16-1,Chandler>So you'll just touch yourself for anything, then?
