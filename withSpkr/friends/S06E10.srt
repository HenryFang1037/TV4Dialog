1
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:03,940
<1-1,Chandler>我问你们
<1-1,Chandler>Let me ask you

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:06,820
<1-1,Chandler>现在为何都只用小灯泡啦
<1-1,Chandler>Why is everybody using these tiny, little lights nowadays?

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:09,010
<1-1,Chandler>我记得以前都用大灯泡啊
<1-1,Chandler>l remember when people used big lights.

4
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:11,480
<1-2,Rachel>钱德勒爷爷话当年
<1-2,Rachel>That's a good story, Grandpa.

5
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:19,530
<1-4,All>莫妮卡让别人布置她的圣诞树
<1-4,All>Wow. Monica's letting other people help decorate her tree?

6
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,030
<1-5,Ross>是谁又把她灌醉了吗
<1-5,Ross>Did someone get her drunk again, or...?

7
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:26,800
<1-6,Monica>圣诞节的意义不在于完美的圣诞树
<1-6,Monica>Having a perfect tree is not what Christmas is about.

8
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:28,940
<1-6,Monica>而是在于与所爱的人共度
<1-6,Monica>lt's about being with loved ones.

9
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:31,680
<1-7,Phoebe>真好  布置好了
<1-7,Phoebe>That is nice. And we're done. Ta- da!

10
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:37,010
<1-8,Chandler>我总觉得它少了一股圣诞味
<1-8,Chandler>lt just doesn't quite feel like Christmas to me.

11
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:39,580
<1-9,Monica>那这样呢
<1-9,Monica>Oh, here.

12
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:44,650
<1-10,Chandler>这样才像圣诞节嘛
<1-10,Chandler>See, now it feels like Christmas.

24
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,150
<2-1,Ross>这就是犹太陀螺的由来
<2-1,Ross>And that's the story of the dreidel.

25
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,150
<2-1,Ross>有些人说圣诞树源自古埃及
<2-1,Ross>Now, some people trace the Christmas tree bace to the Egyptians...

26
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:38,570
<2-1,Ross>在每年白昼最短的日子
<2-1,Ross>...who'd bring green palm branches into their huts

27
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:40,050
<2-1,Ross>他们会把棕榈枝带进屋里
<2-1,Ross>on the shortest day of the year...

28
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,890
<2-1,Ross>象征生命战胜死亡
<2-1,Ross>...symbolizing life's triumph over death.

29
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,070
<2-1,Ross>那是四千年前的事了
<2-1,Ross>And that was, like, 4000 years ago.

30
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:50,000
<2-2,Rachel>你开始讲故事也差不多是那时候
<2-2,Rachel>Around the same time that you started this story.

31
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,540
<2-3,Joey>-你们好  -乔伊
<2-3,Joey>- Hey, you guys. - Hey. What's up?

32
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:57,000
<2-4,Chandler>我不出门不行
<2-4,Chandler>l had to get out of the apartment.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,950
<2-5,Joey>吉宁在家里到处拉筋
<2-5,Joey>Janine's stretching all over the places.

34
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:02,320
<2-5,Joey>一转头就看到她在...
<2-5,Joey>Everywhere l look she's like....

35
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,070
<2-6,Chandler>难怪你无法抗拒
<2-6,Chandler>l can see why that's hard to resist.

36
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:11,580
<2-7,Joey>我好喜欢她
<2-7,Joey>l like her so much.

37
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:13,610
<2-8,Monica>可惜她对你没感觉
<2-8,Monica>l'm sorry she doesn't feel the same.

38
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,580
<2-9,Joey>就是啊  她好可爱
<2-9,Joey>l know. And she's so sweet.

39
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:19,510
<2-9,Joey>我好想喂她吃葡萄  帮她梳头
<2-9,Joey>l just want to feed her grapes and brush her hair.

40
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,180
<2-10,Chandler>你知道她不是猴子吧
<2-10,Chandler>You are aware that she's not a monkey, right?

41
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:28,800
<2-11,Ross>我已经不在乎吉宁了
<2-11,Ross>l am so over Janine.

42
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:31,520
<2-11,Ross>我之前觉得她很火辣
<2-11,Ross>Yeah, at first l thought she was hot,

43
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,900
<2-11,Ross>现在她已经成了过眼云烟了
<2-11,Ross>but now she's like old news.

44
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:37,440
<2-12,Janine>-你们好  -吉宁
<2-12,Janine>- Hey, guys. - Janine!

45
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,650
<2-13,Ross>我刚接到一个
<2-13,Ross>I just got a call to be a dancer

46
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,630
<2-14,Janine>除夕特别节目的通告
<2-14,Janine>on a television special for New Year’s Eve.

<2-14,Janine>lt's called some sort of Dickin' Rockin' Dicky Eve.

53
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:09,880
<2-18,Chandler>内心深处的你仍是那个小胖妹对吧
<2-18,Chandler>You're still just a little fat girl inside, aren't you?

54
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,610
<2-19,Janine>我今年要去当狂欢派对来宾
<2-19,Janine>l'm gonna be one of the party people.

61
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,170

<2-24,Ross>时代广场的部分是现场直播

74
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,510
<2-34,Chandler>应该不是
<2-34,Chandler>l don't think so.

<2-36,Rachel>很遗憾  那应该不算约会
<2-36,Rachel>Yeah, honey, l'm sorry, l don't think that that was a romantic thing.

78
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:27,490
<2-37,Joey>或许吧  但我有一个办法
<2-37,Joey>Well, maybe. But, hey, l know how l can find out.

<10-3,Joey>You told us to show excitement,

252
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,120

261
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,650
<11-5,Ross>回到现场时
<11-5,Ross>When the music starts over again,

262
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,950
<11-5,Ross>我还想跳机器人舞步
<11-5,Ross>...l was thinking about maybe going into the robot.

263
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:50,420
<11-6,Monica>罗斯  跳招牌舞就好啦
<11-6,Monica>Ross, we should stick to the routine.

00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:41,980
<12-2,Chandler>你们好啊
<12-2,Chandler>Oh, hi, guys!

278
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:45,310
<12-3,Phoebe>鸟类的方向感很好
<12-3,Phoebe>You know, birds have a very good sense of direction.

279
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:48,410
<12-3,Phoebe>或许它们可以帮忙找出礼物
<12-3,Phoebe>l thought maybe they could help us find the presents are hidden.

280
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:53,040
<12-4,Chandler>如果礼物正藏在南方过冬的话吧
<12-4,Chandler>Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter.

281
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:55,770
<12-5,Phoebe>顺着你的笑话去找也行
<12-5,Phoebe>Or we could just follow your clever jokes.

282
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:57,720
<12-5,Phoebe>笑话知道在哪里吗  当然不知道
<12-5,Phoebe>Any ideas? Didn't think so.

00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,960
<12-5,Phoebe>来  把礼物找出来
<12-5,Phoebe>Come on, show us where the presents are.

284
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:05,200
<12-6,Chandler>鸭子似乎认为莫妮卡送我垃圾
<12-6,Chandler>The duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage.

285
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:09,060
<12-6,Chandler>什么样的回礼能跟垃圾一样好
<12-6,Chandler>l wonder what l could get Monica that's as good as garbage.

286
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,660
<12-7,Phoebe>我的AZ如何
<12-7,Phoebe>How about my "az"?

287
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:20,140
<12-8,Rachel>-这是空心的  -什么
<12-8,Rachel>- Hey. This is hollow. - What?

<12-9,Phoebe>这排座椅是空心的  我居然都不知道
<12-9,Phoebe>This bench, it's hollow.

289
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,480
<12-10,Rachel>我居然都不知道
<12-10,Rachel>l can't believe l never knew that!

<12-11,Phoebe>Don't look directly at them!

292
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,390
<12-12,Chandler>什么

293
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:35,070
<12-13,Phoebe>没事  可以看
<12-13,Phoebe>All right, no, we could look at them.

<12-20,Phoebe>-等等  我们不能这样  -为什么
<12-20,Phoebe>- Wait a minute. We can't do this. - Why?

299
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:50,560
<12-21,Chandler>我不想知道莫妮卡送我什么
<12-21,Chandler>l don't want to know what Monica got me. You know,

300
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:53,570
<12-23,Chandler>她一定很用心的替我找礼物
<12-23,Chandler>l'm sure she worked really hard at getting me a present,

301
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:55,000
<12-23,Chandler>想给我惊喜
<12-23,Chandler>and wanting to surprise me.

<12-23,Chandler>我们得把礼物放回去

304
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:00,640
<12-24,Rachel>圣诞节不该这样
<12-24,Rachel>This is not what Christmas is about.

305

00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,610
<13-9,Joey>-那时候  -只有那时候
<13-9,Joey>- ln the moment. - But only in the moment.

00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:01,850
<13-9,Joey>你...想再亲一次吗
<13-9,Joey>So do you want to kiss again?

341
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:20,740
<13-14,Janine>乔伊  不必每次接吻都倒数
<13-14,Janine>You don't have to count down every time we kiss.

342
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,910
<13-14,Janine>好
<13-14,Janine>Oh. Okay.

343
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:28,910
<13-15,Joey>但我觉得我需要几秒钟做准备
<13-15,Joey>Except l sort of felt like l needed a couple seconds to get ready.

344
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,960
<14-1,Monica>我们在平台上  准备带全世界跳进千禧年

348
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:09,790
<14-3,Monica>对  不过当然得稍做修正
<14-3,Monica>Yeah! But of course we had to update it a little bit.

<14-3,Monica>你反应真快  知道要接住我
<14-3,Monica>Hey, by the way, quick thinking about catching me.

<14-4,Rachel>There's no way you could've done the end...

351
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,160
