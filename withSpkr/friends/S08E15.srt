<2-17,Monica>会更惹火
<2-17,Monica>your little sister look hotter,

61
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,020
<2-17,Monica>让你的铁哥们更想干她

<6-16,Monica>生孩子是很自然的一件事  过程很美

<7-3,Mona>我帮你买了礼物
<7-3,Mona>I brought you back a present.

00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,340
<7-4,Ross>你用不着这么客气
<7-4,Ross>Come, on. You didn't have to...

<7-5,Mona>谢谢
<7-5,Mona>Thanks.

141
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:29,300
<7-6,Ross>有意思的是
<7-6,Ross>You know, it's interesting,

142
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,290
<7-6,Ross>多数人以为里面添加了海水
<7-6,Ross>most people think this is made with seawater.

143
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:34,750
<7-6,Ross>但事实上它是用加盐淡水做的
<7-6,Ross>But it's actually made with salted fresh water.

144
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,150
<7-6,Ross>这一点意思都没有
<7-6,Ross>That's not interesting.

145
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:42,230
<7-8,Ross>-我觉得很有意思啊  -我也是  我想你
<7-8,Ross>- I think it's interesting. - I do too. I missed you!

<7-8,Ross>我也是
<7-8,Ross>Me too.

147
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:45,790
<7-9,Mona>-这星期你过得如何  -非常好

<7-10,Ross>-宝宝开始会动了  -太棒了
<7-10,Ross>- Actually, the baby started kicking. - How exciting!

149
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:51,940
<7-12,Ross>太神奇了  只可惜
<7-12,Ross>Yeah. it was amazing. The only thing sad is,

150
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,670
<7-12,Ross>第一次我并不在场
<7-12,Ross>I wasn't around when it happened for the first time.

151
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:58,330
<7-14,Ross>-不是吧  -我还错过了不少别的事情
<7-14,Ross>- Oh, no. - Yeah. I was missing out on all this other stuff too.

152
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:01,650
<7-14,Ross>所以乔伊建议瑞秋搬过来跟我住
<7-14,Ross>So Joey suggested Rachel move in with me.

153
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:03,440
<7-15,Mona>想得美
<7-15,Mona>Yeah, right.

154
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:07,350
<7-16,Ross>-怎么了  -乔伊害我笑得肚子痛
<7-16,Ross>- What? - Joey cracks me up.

155
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:09,930
<7-17,Mona>"让你前妻搬去跟你住吧
<7-17,Mona>It's like, "Yeah, why don't you have your ex-wife move in with you?

156
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:11,720
<7-17,Mona>那一点也不别扭"
<7-17,Mona>That wouldn't be awkward at all."

157
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:19,150
<7-19,Mona>想像一下  我才离开了几天
<7-19,Mona>Can you imagine, I go away for a few days...

158
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,520
<7-19,Mona>回来时却发现男友
<7-19,Mona>I come back and my boyfriend

159
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,000
<7-19,Mona>跟怀了他孩子的女人同居了
<7-19,Mona>is living with some woman he got pregnant.

160
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:28,320
<7-20,Mona>你怎么跟他说的
<7-20,Mona>So, what'd you tell him?

161
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,700
<8-1,Phoebe>你怎么会没告诉蒙娜瑞秋搬过去了
<8-1,Phoebe>How could you not tell Mona that Rachel is living with you?

162
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:47,330
<8-2,Ross>她似乎觉得这个想法很不可思议
<8-2,Ross>I don't know. She seemed to think it was such a crazy idea.

163
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:50,740
<8-2,Ross>而且她送了我太纪糖
<8-2,Ross>Plus, she got me taffy.

164
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:54,700
<8-3,Phoebe>-真的吗  我从没吃过  -从没吃过
<8-3,Phoebe>- Taffy? Really? I've never had any. - Ever?

165
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:59,170
<8-5,Phoebe>我妈忙着计划自杀  没空买盐水零食给我
<8-5,Phoebe>My mom was too busy planning her suicide to provide saltwater treats.

166
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,580
<8-5,Phoebe>谢谢
<8-5,Phoebe>Thank you.

167
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:04,490
<8-5,Phoebe>你打算一直瞒着她吗
<8-5,Phoebe>So what, you're just never going to tell her?

168
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:07,470
<8-6,Ross>不  我会说的  但得先哄哄她
<8-6,Ross>No, no, no. I will. I just want to butter her up first.

169
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:10,350
<8-6,Ross>我要带她去吃一顿丰盛的情人节晚餐
<8-6,Ross>I'm going to take her to an amazing Valentine's dinner,

170
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:12,480
<8-6,Ross>做一些浪漫的事
<8-6,Ross>do all this romantic stuff.

171
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:15,810
<8-6,Ross>当她觉得我是有史以来最棒的男朋友时
<8-6,Ross>And then just when she thinks I'm the best boyfriend in the world,

172
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:19,550
<8-6,Ross>我会告诉她  我怀孕的前女友跟我同居了
<8-6,Ross>then I'm gonna tell her my pregnant ex-girlfriend is living with me.

173
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:24,040
<8-7,Phoebe>或许我之前没提过  她是个非常幸运的女人
<8-7,Phoebe>If I haven't said it before, she's a lucky, lucky lady.

175
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:35,200
<8-7,Phoebe>到底是口香糖还是食物  能不能咽下去
<8-7,Phoebe>God, is it gum? Is it food? What's the deal?

00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:24,360
<10-31,Mona>我们需要隐私
<10-31,Mona>and, we gotta have some boundaries,

244
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,520
<10-31,Mona>你为什么不回你家  给我们留点隐私呢
<10-31,Mona>so why don't you go back to your place and give us some privacy?

245
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,770
<10-32,Rachel>蒙娜  我住在这里
<10-32,Rachel>But, Mona, I live here.

246
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:36,260
<10-32,Rachel>情人节快乐
<10-32,Rachel>Happy Valentine's Day!

247
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,800
<10-33,Ross>这也可以作为分手礼物
<10-33,Ross>Or, something to remember me by.

248
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:56,330
<11-1,Monica>-这次是多久  -九十秒
<11-1,Monica>- How long has it been this time? - 90 seconds.

249
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,170
<11-3,Monica>有进步
<11-3,Monica>That's better.

250
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,740
<11-3,Monica>九十秒没去想那个场景  已经很久了
<11-3,Monica>Ninety seconds is a long time not to think about it.

251
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,940
<11-3,Monica>但其实我满脑子全是那些画面
<11-3,Monica>Except all I did was think about it.

252
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:05,860
<11-4,Chandler>我知道  我也忘不了
<11-4,Chandler>I know. It haunts me.

253
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,380
<11-4,Chandler>我之前见识过最不堪入目的事
<11-4,Chandler>Up till now, the worst thing I ever saw,

254
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:10,710
<11-4,Chandler>是我爸跟脱光的男仆把酒言欢
<11-4,Chandler>was my father doing tequila shots off the naked houseboy.

255
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:15,010
<11-4,Chandler>看完这个  我甚至乐意把他们的照片做成屏保
<11-4,Chandler>After this, I would gladly make that my screen saver.

256
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:18,030
<11-5,Monica>我们得忘了这件事
<11-5,Monica>We have to get past this.

257
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,090
<11-5,Monica>我们把录像带扔掉  假装不存在
<11-5,Monica>Why don't we get rid of the tape and pretend it never existed?

258
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:23,370
<11-6,Chandler>-这点我能做到  -好
<11-6,Chandler>- I could do that. - Okay.

259
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:30,810
<11-8,Chandler>现在我们只要丢掉这张椅子就行
<11-8,Chandler>Okay. Now all we gotta do is get rid of this chair.

260
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,520
<11-9,Monica>-谢天谢地  -可不是嘛
<11-9,Monica>- Oh, thank God! - I know.

261
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:50,780
<11-11,Monica>请进
<11-11,Monica>Come in!

262
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:54,710
<11-12,Rachel>抱歉破坏了你们的情人节
<11-12,Rachel>Hi. I'm so sorry to barge in on your Valentine, but...

263
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,840
<11-12,Rachel>但我实在受不了他们吵来吵去
<11-12,Rachel>I had to get away from the yelling.

264
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,470
<11-12,Rachel>蒙娜要跟罗斯分手
<11-12,Rachel>Mona's dumping Ross.

265
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:00,550
<11-13,Monica>-天啊  -可怜的罗斯
<11-13,Monica>- Oh, my God. - Poor Ross.

266
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:07,230
<11-14,Chandler>平时我们得看他穿内裤做瑜伽
<11-14,Chandler>Great, we have to watch him do yoga in his underwear,

267
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:09,590
<11-15,Chandler>结果现在他却把窗帘拉上了
<11-15,Chandler>but for this he closes the drapes.

268
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:13,680
<11-16,Monica>瑞秋  关于你想看的那卷生产录影带
<11-16,Monica>Rach, you know that birthing tape you wanted to see?

269
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,340
<11-16,Monica>在我这里
<11-16,Monica>It's here.

270
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,630
<11-17,Chandler>我们得在你看之前警告你
<11-17,Chandler>We should warn you before you watch it.

271
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,970
<11-17,Chandler>千万别看
<11-17,Chandler>Don't watch it.

272
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,330
<11-18,Rachel>你们看过了  很可怕吗
<11-18,Rachel>You saw it? Is it scary?

273
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:24,900
<11-19,Chandler>讽刺的是  "生"孩子的画面
<11-19,Chandler>Well, let's just say that it's ironic how footage

274
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:28,600
<11-19,Chandler>让人很想去"死"
<11-19,Chandler>of someone being born can make you want to kill yourself.

275
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:34,500
<11-20,Rachel>现在我被吓住了  你们能跟我一起看吗
<11-20,Rachel>Now I'm all freaked out. Come on, will you watch it with me?

276
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,150
<11-21,Monica>不行  但我会把有我体味的毛衣
<11-21,Monica>No, but I'll leave a sweater that smells like me

277
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,710
<11-21,Monica>放在你旁边
<11-21,Monica>right next to you.

278
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:43,980
<11-22,Rachel>说真的  你们不能让我一个人看这种东西
<11-22,Rachel>Seriously, you guys, you're not gonna make me watch this alone.

279
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:49,280
<11-23,Monica>她说得对  当然不行
<11-23,Monica>She's right. Of course not.

280
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,930
<11-23,Monica>亲爱的  去拿录影带
<11-23,Monica>Honey, get the tape.

281
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:01,900
<11-24,Chandler>这个动作我想起了录影带里的某一段内容
<11-24,Chandler>This reminds me of a very specific part of the tape.

282
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:07,620
<11-24,Chandler>来吧
<11-24,Chandler>Here we go.

283
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,760
<11-24,Chandler>好吧
<11-24,Chandler>Okay.

284
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,750
<11-25,Rachel>天啊
<11-25,Rachel>Oh, my.

285
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:20,380
<11-25,Rachel>-加油  -为什么宝宝要折磨那个女人
<11-25,Rachel>- Come on, come on.  -Why is that baby torturing that woman?

286
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:24,390
<11-26,Chandler>为什么这种玩意我要连看三次
<11-26,Chandler>Why have I seen this thing three times?

287
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,550
<11-27,Monica>但还是很美好啊
<11-27,Monica>It's still beautiful.

288
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:29,900
<11-28,Rachel>好可怕
<11-28,Rachel>It's horrible!

289
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:33,810
<11-29,Monica>-我知道  我为你感到难过  -天啊
<11-29,Monica>- I know, I know! I'm so sorry for you! - Oh, my god.

290
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:38,130
<11-32,Rachel>-你们快看   -怎么  她屁股爆炸了吗
<11-32,Rachel>-You guys! You guys, look! - What? Did her ass explode?

291
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:44,550
<11-33,Chandler>不  宝宝出来了  你们看
<11-33,Chandler>No, the baby's out. Look, look.

292
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:49,850
<11-34,Monica>看看那些小手指跟小脚趾
<11-34,Monica>Look at those little fingers and toes.

293
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,670
<11-35,Chandler>看看妈妈现在有多高兴
<11-35,Chandler>Look how happy the mom is now.

294
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:55,890
<11-36,Monica>-瑞秋  -去你们的
<11-36,Monica>- Oh, Rach. - Screw you guys!

295
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:57,450
<11-37,Rachel>要生孩子的又不是你们
<11-37,Rachel>You don't have to do it!

296
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:07,940
<12-3,Ross>-怎么了  -蒙娜刚刚甩了我
<12-3,Ross>- What's up? - Mona just dumped me.

297
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:10,850
<12-4,Joey>天啊  我很遗憾  为什么
<12-4,Joey>Oh, man, I'm sorry. Why?

298
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:12,700
<12-5,Ross>从我最近的种种表现来看
<12-5,Ross>Well, with everything that's been going on lately,

299
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,680
<12-5,Ross>我算不上个称职的男友
<12-5,Ross>I haven't exactly been the perfect boyfriend.

300
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,570
<12-5,Ross>我没有告诉她  我让瑞秋怀孕了
<12-5,Ross>I didn't tell her I got Rachel pregnant.

301
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:23,200
<12-5,Ross>我给了她我家的钥匙  然后换了锁
<12-5,Ross>I gave her a key to my apartment and then had the locks changed.

302
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:27,660
<12-5,Ross>关于瑞秋搬到我家的事  我跟她撒了谎
<12-5,Ross>Then I lied to her about Rachel moving in with me.

303
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,810
<12-5,Ross>其实  我想怪她不早点跟我分手
<12-5,Ross>In a way, I judge her for not breaking up with me sooner.

304
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,660
<12-6,Joey>这打击太大了
<12-6,Joey>That really sucks, man.

305
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,980
<12-6,Joey>-特别是在情人节  -是啊
<12-6,Joey>- Especially on Valentine's Day. - Yeah.

306
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:39,750
<12-7,Ross>等一下  你在这里做什么
<12-7,Ross>Wait a minute. What are you doing here?

307
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:44,240
<12-7,Ross>乔伊·崔比安尼在情人节却没有约会
<12-7,Ross>Joey Tribbiani without a date on Valentine's Day?

308
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,240
<12-7,Ross>发生了什么事  遇上感情困扰了吗
<12-7,Ross>What's going on, huh? Girl trouble?

309
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:51,340
<12-8,Joey>-可以那么说  -真的吗
<12-8,Joey>- Sort of. - Really?

310
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,270
<12-10,Joey>你不必表现得这么高兴
<12-10,Joey>You don't have to seem so happy about it.

311
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:57,530
<12-11,Ross>抱歉  或许我能帮忙
<12-11,Ross>Sorry. Maybe I can help.

312
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:02,440
<12-12,Joey>不论发生了什么事  我相信我也有相同的经验
<12-12,Joey>Whatever it is, I am sure it has happened to me.

313
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:07,770
<12-13,Ross>事实上 我有次在做爱过程中被甩了
<12-13,Ross>You know, actually, once I got dumped during sex.

314
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:14,880
<12-14,Ross>到底发生了什么事
<12-14,Ross>So anyway, what is it?

315
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,810
<12-15,Joey>算了  没什么大不了的
<12-15,Joey>Forget about it. It's no big deal.

316
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:18,900
<12-16,Ross>-少来了  怎么了  -没事
<12-16,Ross>- Come on, Joey, what is it? - It's nothing.

317
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,570
<12-18,Ross>你连我都不能告诉吗
<12-18,Ross>Hey, it's me. Why can't you tell me?

318
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,510
<12-19,Joey>好吧  坐下
<12-19,Joey>Okay. Sit down.

319
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,920
<12-19,Joey>我很喜欢一个女人
<12-19,Joey>There's this woman that I like a lot.

320
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:38,500
<12-19,Joey>但我们不可能在一起
<12-19,Joey>But it can't happen.

321
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,120
<12-20,Ross>她不会是你的姐妹吧
<12-20,Ross>She's not a Tribbiani?

322
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:44,990
<12-21,Joey>不是
<12-21,Joey>No!

323
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:49,730
<12-22,Ross>她是你的同事吗
<12-22,Ross>So is she someone from work?

324
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,080
<12-23,Joey>对
<12-23,Joey>Yes.

325
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,640
<12-24,Ross>她喜欢你吗
<12-24,Ross>Well, does she like you?

326
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,460
<12-25,Joey>有时候我觉得是的
<12-25,Joey>Sometimes I think maybe she could.

327
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:01,630
<12-25,Joey>但这都无济于事  因为我不能追她
<12-25,Joey>But it doesn't matter, because I can't do anything about it.

328
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:02,810
<12-26,Ross>为什么
<12-26,Ross>Why not?

329
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,840
<12-27,Joey>事情很复杂
<12-27,Joey>It's complicated.

330
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:09,320
<12-27,Joey>她跟另一个男人交往了很久
<12-27,Joey>She was with this other guy for a long time.

331
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:10,980
<12-27,Joey>他也是我的同事
<12-27,Joey>Someone from work too.

332
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:14,780
<12-27,Joey>我不能对他做那种事
<12-27,Joey>And I could never do that to the guy,

333
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,760
<12-27,Joey>因为我们是好朋友
<12-27,Joey>because we're really good friends.

334
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:20,060
<12-28,Ross>以前跟她交往过的那个男人
<12-28,Ross>So this guy she used to go out with,

335
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:22,860
<12-28,Ross>还爱着她吗
<12-28,Ross>is he still in love with her?

336
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,640
<12-29,Joey>-我想应该不爱了  -好吧
<12-29,Joey>- No, I don't think so. - Okay.

337
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:27,500
<12-30,Ross>他是好人吗
<12-30,Ross>Is he a good guy?

338
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,890
<12-31,Joey>对  他最棒了
<12-31,Joey>Yeah, he's the best.

339
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,340
<12-32,Ross>那就跟他谈谈
<12-32,Ross>Then talk to him.

340
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,520
<12-32,Ross>-他可能不会介意呢  -我不知道
<12-32,Ross>- He might be fine with it. - I don't know.

341
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,810
<12-34,Ross>乔伊  如果你真的喜欢她  这值得一试
<12-34,Ross>Joey, come on, it's worth finding out, if you really like her.

342
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:39,730
<12-35,Joey>我真的非常喜欢她
<12-35,Joey>I do, so much.

343
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:42,700
<12-35,Joey>我没办法不想她  我睡不着...
<12-35,Joey>I can't stop thinking about her. I can't sleep...

344
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,900
<12-36,Ross>你知道吗  你得尽力去争取
<12-36,Ross>Okay, Joey, you know what? You have to go for it.

345
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:48,770
<12-36,Ross>你多久才会动一次真情
<12-36,Ross>How often does this happen to you?

346
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:51,050
<12-36,Ross>你要对自己负责
<12-36,Ross>You owe it to yourself.

347
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,650
<12-37,Gunther>你的温牛奶来了
<12-37,Gunther>Here's your warm milk.

348
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:02,450
<12-38,Ross>我要回家加点波本酒
<12-38,Ross>I'm gonna put the bourbon in it at home.

349
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:09,180
<12-39,Joey>说真的  跟那个男的谈谈  好吗
<12-39,Joey>Anyway, seriously, just talk to the guy, okay?

350
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:10,750
<12-40,Ross>告诉我结果
<12-40,Ross>Let me know how it goes.

351
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:14,260
<12-40,Ross>是瑞秋
<12-40,Ross>It's Rachel.

352
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:28,100
<13-1,Rachel>你要生孩子了  你得做好准备
<13-1,Rachel>You're having a baby and you need to be prepared.

353
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:32,150
<13-1,Rachel>你得看完整只录影带  看吧
<13-1,Rachel>You're gonna make yourself watch the whole thing. Just do it!

354
