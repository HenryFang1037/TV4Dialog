<1-3,Ross>Wow! It looks really violent!

00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:16,720
<1-4,Joey>我知道  我即将在各大戏院露面

00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,970
<1-7,Phoebe>-是我先说的  -我还以为是我
<1-7,Phoebe>- I started that! - I thought I did!

10
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,180
<1-8,Joey>我刚刚跟经纪人谈过...
<1-8,Joey>Guess what? I just talked to my agent...

<1-10,Joey>-我们要坐加长豪华轿车吗  -当然
<1-10,Joey>- Will we take a limo? - Sure! Why not?

13
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:40,330
<1-11,Monica>不去参加葬礼还能坐加长车  简直太棒了
<1-11,Monica>I love taking limos when nobody died.

14
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,630
<1-12,Rachel>我显然没办法去了
<1-12,Rachel>Well, obviously I won't be able to come.

18
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,060
<1-12,Rachel>在我怀孕期间一直这么照顾我
<1-12,Rachel>for how great you've been during this time.

19
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,790
<1-12,Rachel>没有你们我绝对办不到
<1-12,Rachel>I really couldn't have done it without you.

20
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:58,360
<1-12,Rachel>过去的九个月我很开心
<1-12,Rachel>I loved these last 9 months.

21
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,050
<1-12,Rachel>虽说我很期待进入下一阶段...
<1-12,Rachel>Even though I'm looking forward to the next part...

22
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,030
<1-12,Rachel>我会很怀念怀孕的这段时光
<1-12,Rachel>...I am really gonna miss being pregnant.

23
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,520
<2-1,Rachel>没错  我还是没生
<2-1,Rachel>That's right. Still no baby.

24
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:14,850
<2-1,Rachel>拜托  给我腾点地方坐
<2-1,Rachel>Come on, people, make some room.

25
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:18,510
<2-2,Ross>亲爱的  或许你坐在这里会比较舒服
<2-2,Ross>Sweetie, maybe you'd be more comfortable here.

26
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,720
<2-3,Rachel>你
<2-3,Rachel>You.

27
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,840
<2-3,Rachel>你对我做的孽还不够多吗
<2-3,Rachel>Like you haven't done enough.

28
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:31,140
<2-4,Ross>我知道你现在很痛苦
<2-4,Ross>I know how miserable you are.

29
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,740
<2-4,Ross>我真的希望能帮上忙
<2-4,Ross>I wish there was something I could do.

30
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:35,450
<2-4,Ross>我希望自己是海马
<2-4,Ross>I wish I were a sea horse.

31
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:43,310
<2-4,Ross>因为是公海马负责孵育小宝宝
<2-4,Ross>Because with sea horses, it's the male. They carry the babies.

32
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:49,540
<2-4,Ross>而且我还会生活在海里  离你远远的
<2-4,Ross>And then also, I'd be far away in the sea.

33
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,560
<2-4,Ross>天啊
<2-4,Ross>God.

34
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:09,850
<2-5,Rachel>我这辈子从来没有这么难受过
<2-5,Rachel>I have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life.

35
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:12,270
<2-6,Phoebe>我了解  我也有过这种经历  我记得最后
<2-6,Phoebe>I know. I've been there. I remember toward the end...

36
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,880
<2-7,Rachel>菲比  你的故事很精彩
<2-7,Rachel>Phoebe, that's a great story.

37
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,310
<2-7,Rachel>能不能帮我拿杯冰茶来再说
<2-7,Rachel>Can you tell it to me when you're getting me some iced tea?

38
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:24,170
<2-7,Rachel>天啊  滚出来  滚出来  滚出来
<2-7,Rachel>Oh, God, get out! Get out, get out, get out!

39
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,680
<2-7,Rachel>咱们滚吧
<2-7,Rachel>Let's.

51
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:13,220
<3-1,Chandler>你生完宝宝了吗
<3-1,Chandler>Hey, did you have the baby yet?

52
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,490
<3-2,Rachel>你想让我过去坐在你身上吗
<3-2,Rachel>Do you want me to come over there and sit on you?

53
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:18,930
<3-2,Rachel>我真做得出来
<3-2,Rachel>Because I'll do it.

54
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:21,720
<3-3,Monica>你怎么这么早就回来了
<3-3,Monica>What are you doing here so early?

55
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,520
<3-4,Rachel>公司要我回家
<3-4,Rachel>They sent me home from work.

56
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,720
<3-4,Rachel>他们让我从现在就开始休产假  回家休息
<3-4,Rachel>They said, "Start your maternity leave now. Just rest."

57
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:29,200
<3-4,Rachel>为宝宝出生做好准备  去他们的
<3-4,Rachel>Get ready for the baby. You know what? Screw them!

58
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:30,840
<3-4,Rachel>如果他们不要我待在公司
<3-4,Rachel>If they don't want me there,

59
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,770
<3-4,Rachel>我就跟你们待在一起
<3-4,Rachel>I'll hang out with you guys.

60
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,890
<3-5,Phoebe>或许你可以去做义工
<3-5,Phoebe>Or you could do volunteer work.

61
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:42,410
<3-7,Estelle>-喂  -乔伊  我是艾丝特尔
<3-7,Estelle>- Hello? - Joey, it's Estelle.

62
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:44,980
<3-7,Estelle>好消息  我帮搞你到了首映会的门票
<3-7,Estelle>Great news. I was able to get you

63
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,650
<3-7,Estelle>你可以带一位朋友出席
<3-7,Estelle>and one guest tickets to your premiere.

64
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:49,980
<3-8,Joey>一位朋友  你之前说我可以拿到六张票
<3-8,Joey>One guess? You told me I could have six tickets.

65
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,830
<3-9,Estelle>我把其中四张拿去易趣网拍卖了
<3-9,Estelle>Well, I sold four of them on eBay.

66
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:57,710
<3-9,Estelle>你会坐在"帅哥372"旁边
<3-9,Estelle>You'll be sitting next to HotGuy372.

67
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:02,640
<3-10,Joey>天啊  难道我就只能带一个朋友去吗
<3-10,Joey>Oh, my god. So that's it? I only get to bring one guest?

68
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,360
<3-11,Estelle>对  你什么时候来接我
<3-11,Estelle>Yeah. What time you wanna pick me up?

69
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,480
<3-11,Estelle>喂
<3-11,Estelle>Hello?

70
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,920
<3-12,Joey>你们听到了吗
<3-12,Joey>You hear that?

71
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,350
<3-12,Joey>我只能带一个朋友参加首映会
<3-12,Joey>I only get one extra ticket to my premiere.

72
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:16,190
<3-12,Joey>所以我得在你们三个跟罗斯之间做选择
<3-12,Joey>So somehow I have to pick between you three and Ross.

73
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:23,210
<3-14,Joey>-我呢  -你说过你不想去
<3-14,Joey>- What about me? - You said you didn't want to go.

74
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:26,040
<3-15,Rachel>没错  但我还是希望有被重视的感觉
<3-15,Rachel>I don't. But I would still like to be acknowledged.

75
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,380
<3-15,Rachel>难道我怀孕了就变成隐形人了吗
<3-15,Rachel>Because I'm pregnant, I'm invisible?

76
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,230
<3-16,Joey>你绝不是隐形人
<3-16,Joey>Definitely not invisible.

77
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:37,420
<3-17,Monica>罗斯根本不在这里  所以他出局了
<3-17,Monica>Ross didn't care enough to be here, so I think he's out.

78
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,140
<3-17,Monica>你打磕睡  你就输了
<3-17,Monica>You snooze, you lose.

79
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,270
<3-18,Chandler>他没有打磕睡  他在教书
<3-18,Chandler>He's not snoozing. He's teaching a class.

80
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:43,140
<3-18,Chandler>那么一定有人在打磕睡
<3-18,Chandler>Well, then somebody's snoozing.

81
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:46,630
<3-19,Monica>乔伊  不要因为我的话影响你的选择
<3-19,Monica>And, Joey, not that this should affect you at all,

82
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:49,340
<3-19,Monica>但如果你选了我...
<3-19,Monica>but if you pick me...

83
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:53,730
<3-19,Monica>我打算穿露到这里的紧身连衣裙
<3-19,Monica>...I was planning on wearing a sequin dress cut down to here.

84
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,570
<3-20,Chandler>我还没有看过这套连衣裙
<3-20,Chandler>I haven't seen this dress.

85
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,140
<3-21,Monica>穿上绝对有影星风范
<3-21,Monica>Star in a movie.

86
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:02,560
<3-22,Phoebe>乔伊  你想挑谁都可以
<3-22,Phoebe>Joey, you pick whoever you want.

87
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,190
<3-22,Phoebe>听从你内心的声音
<3-22,Phoebe>Listen to your heart.

88
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,590
<3-22,Phoebe>它跟你说了什么
<3-22,Phoebe>What does it tell you?

89
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,150
<3-24,Phoebe>菲比  菲比  菲比...
<3-24,Phoebe>Phoebe. Phoebe. Phoebe.

90
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:11,660
<3-22,Phoebe>这个嘛...
<3-22,Phoebe>Well...

91
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,400
<3-23,Joey>我想我要挑钱德勒
<3-23,Joey>I think I want to take Chandler.

92
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:19,960
<3-24,Phoebe>菲比  菲比  菲比...
<3-24,Phoebe>Phoebe, Phoebe, Phoebe.

93
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:23,940
<3-25,Chandler>你想带我去吗
<3-25,Chandler>You want to take me?

94
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:26,910
<3-26,Joey>对  我希望能带大家一起去
<3-26,Joey>Yeah, I'm sorry. I wish I could take everybody.

95
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,980
<3-26,Joey>但钱德勒一直都很支持我的工作
<3-26,Joey>But Chandler's always supported my career.

96
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:33,290
<3-26,Joey>他帮我付表演课跟大头照等等的费用
<3-26,Joey>He's paid for acting classes, headshots and stuff.

97
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:35,860
<3-26,Joey>这就是我回报你的方式
<3-26,Joey>This will be my way of paying you back.

98
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,530
<3-27,Chandler>所以你不打算还我钱了吗
<3-27,Chandler>So you're never actually going to pay me back?

99
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:46,720
<3-28,Monica>只因为他帮你付大头照的钱  你就要选他
<3-28,Monica>Just because he paid for your headshots, you're gonna take him?

100
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:50,640
<3-28,Monica>你大概还没搞明白那件连衣裙有多露
<3-28,Monica>I don't think you're comprehending just how slutty this dress is.

101
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,550
<3-29,Joey>不仅是因为他帮我付了钱
<3-29,Joey>It's not just the stuff he paid for.

102
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:56,880
<3-29,Joey>他真的很支持我  你们知道吗
<3-29,Joey>It's everything, you know?

103
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,920
<3-29,Joey>他跟我对台词
<3-29,Joey>He read lines with me.

104
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,980
<3-29,Joey>我紧张的时候  他陪我去试镜
<3-29,Joey>He went with me on auditions when I was nervous.

105
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:05,500
<3-29,Joey>我没拿到我想要的角色时  他会安慰我
<3-29,Joey>Then he consoled me after I didn't get parts that I really wanted.

106
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,930
<3-29,Joey>你一直很相信我
<3-29,Joey>You always believed in me, man,

107
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:09,140
<3-29,Joey>即使连我都不相信自己
<3-29,Joey>even when I didn't believe in myself.

108
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,670
<3-30,Chandler>我一直都知道你会成功
<3-30,Chandler>I always knew you were gonna make it.

109
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,180
<3-30,Chandler>我非常以你为荣
<3-30,Chandler>I'm so proud of you.

110
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:16,150
<3-31,Joey>谢谢  那对我来说很重要
<3-31,Joey>Thanks, that means a lot to me.

111
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,780
<3-32,Phoebe>莫妮卡  或许他们之中有人想穿你的连衣裙
<3-32,Phoebe>Mon, maybe one of these guys wants to wear your dress.

112
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,120
<3-33,Joey>我得去刮胡子
<3-33,Joey>I'm gonna go shave.

113
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:28,840
<3-34,Chandler>对  我得去吐痰了
<3-34,Chandler>Yeah, well, I'm gonna go spit.

114
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,180
<3-35,Rachel>我得去尿尿了
<3-35,Rachel>I have to pee.

115
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,300
<3-35,Rachel>如果五分钟后我还没出来
<3-35,Rachel>If I don't come out in five minutes,

116
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:40,380
<3-35,Rachel>那肯定是因为我被百花香味给熏死了
<3-35,Rachel>it's because I've choked to death on the potpourri stink.

117
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:45,350
<3-36,Phoebe>等她出来以后  你捏住她的鼻子
<3-36,Phoebe>When she comes out, you hold her nose,

118
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:48,400
<3-36,Phoebe>我对她的嘴巴吹气  宝宝就会掉出来
<3-36,Phoebe>I'll blow in her mouth and the kid'll just... right out of her.

119
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:54,410
<3-37,Monica>她都晚了一周了  今天她一定会生
<3-37,Monica>She's over a week late. She's got to have it today, right?

120
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:57,590
<3-38,Phoebe>我不知道  我觉得应该还要一阵子
<3-38,Phoebe>I don't know. I think it's still gonna be a while.

121
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:00,620
<3-39,Monica>你想加点刺激吗
<3-39,Monica>Care to make it interesting?

122
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,510
<3-39,Monica>我跟你打赌  她明天这个时候就会生
<3-39,Monica>I bet you she'll have it by this time tomorrow.

<3-42,Phoebe>-好吧  赌多少  -我跟你赌十万块
<3-42,Phoebe>- Okay, how much? - One hundred thousand dollars.

126
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:14,210
<3-44,Phoebe>好吧  我会打电话让苏黎世银行汇点钱过来
<3-44,Phoebe>Fine, I'll call Zurich and move some money around.

<3-46,Phoebe>家里没人
<3-46,Phoebe>No one's here.

00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:48,550
<4-2,Joey>-太高了一点  -什么
<4-2,Joey>- A little tall. - What?

133
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:51,480
<4-4,Joey>你能不能蹲低一点  让我看起来高一点
<4-4,Joey>Would you crouch down a bit so that I look taller?

134
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,130
<4-4,Joey>很好
<4-4,Joey>There you go.

135

<4-5,Chandler>Oh, hey, Mon? Rach is here.

138
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:13,770
<4-5,Chandler>真对不起  我知道你很不舒服
<4-5,Chandler>I'm sorry. I know how uncomfortable you are.

00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,430
<5-1,Phoebe>你知道吗  你看起来棒极了
<5-1,Phoebe>You know what? You look great.

<5-1,Phoebe>就跟50块钞票一样
<5-1,Phoebe>Yeah, like 50 bucks.

141
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:22,050
<5-2,Rachel>我得去尿尿
<5-2,Rachel>I have to go pee.

142
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,060
<5-2,Rachel>很明显  这个宝宝把我的膀腕当成玩具捏
<5-2,Rachel>Apparently this baby thinks my bladder is a squeeze toy.

143
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:31,780
<5-3,Monica>该死  50块拿去
<5-3,Monica>Damn it. Here's your 50 bucks.

00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:34,110
<5-4,Phoebe>你竟然会输  这真是太有趣了
<5-4,Phoebe>That's interesting that you lost.

145
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,170
<5-4,Phoebe>我记不得了  你喜欢输吗
<5-4,Phoebe>Now, I forget, do you like to lose?

146
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:38,660
<5-4,Phoebe>好吧  别说了
<5-4,Phoebe>All right, stop it.

147
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:42,810
<5-5,Monica>-我们加倍赌她明天会生  -好  跟你赌
<5-5,Monica>- Double or nothing she has it by tomorrow. - Fine, you're on.

148
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,400
<5-7,Monica>在那之前  葛兰特将军
<5-7,Monica>Until then, General Grant,

149
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,320
<5-8,Phoebe>你就在这里安心扎营吧
<5-8,Phoebe>why don't you set up camp... right there?

150
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,900
<5-9,Ross>瑞秋在这里吗  我们得去看医生
<5-9,Ross>Is Rachel here? We have a doctor's appointment.

151
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,340
<5-10,Monica>她在厕所里
<5-10,Monica>She's in the bathroom.

152
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:56,510
<5-11,Ross>-瑞秋  我们得走了  -马上好
<5-11,Ross>- Rach, we gotta go. - In a minute!

153
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,120
<5-12,Rachel>大家问我们为什么没在一起
<5-12,Rachel>People ask me why we're not together.

154
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,330
<5-13,Ross>我都不知道该怎么告诉他们
<5-13,Ross>I just don't know what to tell them.

155
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,760
<5-14,Rachel>好吧  我们走吧
<5-14,Rachel>All right, all right, let's go.

156
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,510
<5-15,Ross>你要不要先去换衣服
<5-15,Ross>Do you want to go change first?

157
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:11,810
<5-15,Ross>医生会等我们  但如果你快一点的话...
<5-15,Ross>The doctor's staying open late for us, but if you hurry...

158
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:15,460
<5-16,Rachel>不用  我这样很好
<5-16,Rachel>No, I'm fine.

159
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:18,160
<5-17,Ross>你不觉穿这套衣服有点不合适吗
<5-17,Ross>You don't think that's a little inappropriate?

160
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:21,780
<5-18,Phoebe>-什么  -天啊  别火上浇油了
<5-18,Phoebe>- What? - Good God, man. Don't anger it.

161
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:29,540
<5-19,Rachel>罗斯  现在外面有38度高温
<5-19,Rachel>Ross, it is 100 degrees outside.

162
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,350
<5-19,Rachel>这是好几个星期以来我第一次...
<5-19,Rachel>For the first time in weeks, I am...

163
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:33,820
<5-20,Ross>好吧  随便你
<5-20,Ross>Fine. Whatever you want.

164
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,430
<5-20,Ross>你是妈咪
<5-20,Ross>You're the mommy.

165
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:37,570
<5-21,Rachel>可别叫我"妈眯"
<5-21,Rachel>No! Don't call me "Mommy."

166
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:41,810
<5-21,Rachel>你那么称呼你妈就已经够受了
<5-21,Rachel>It's bad enough you call your own mother that.

167
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:43,480
<5-22,Monica>这一次我同意她的说法
<5-22,Monica>I'm actually with her on this one.

168
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:54,500
<6-1,Joey>我还以为自己知道敌人是谁  但敌人却是你
<6-1,Joey>I thought I knew who the enemy was, but it was you all along.

169
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:57,580
<6-2,Joey>好了  我的打斗戏要开始了
<6-2,Joey>Okay, this is it. This is my big fight scene coming up.

170
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:02,850
<7-3,Rachel>我要为第82地面师的每位弟兄奋战
<7-3,Rachel>I'm fighting for every man in the 82nd Ground Division.

171
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,380
<7-4,Ross>罗斯  我能问你一件事吗
<7-4,Ross>Ross? Can I ask you something?

172
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:18,060
<7-5,Rachel>卡罗尔怀本的时候...
<7-5,Rachel>When Carol was pregnant with Ben...

173
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,550
<7-6,Ross>你有这么暴躁吗
<7-6,Ross>...were you this irritating?

174
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:28,630
<7-7,Rachel>-你说什么  -没事  你只是...
<7-7,Rachel>- Excuse me? - Nothing. You're just...

175
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:31,890
<7-8,Ross>你最近对我很不耐烦
<7-8,Ross>You've been a little short with me lately.

176
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,840
<7-9,Rachel>我无意惹毛你
<7-9,Rachel>I'm not trying to irritate you.

177
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:36,620
<7-10,Ross>那么你一定是有惹毛我的天份
<7-10,Ross>Well, then, you must have a natural talent for it.

178
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,400
<7-11,Rachel>医生马上就要过来了
<7-11,Rachel>You know what? The doctor will be in soon.

179
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,120
<7-12,Ross>我们在那之前还是别说话了吧
<7-12,Ross>Why don't we not speak until then?

180
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,240
<7-12,Ross>好吧
<7-12,Ross>Okay.

181
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:50,800
<7-13,Rachel>呼吸声再大一点   罗斯  感觉真好
<7-13,Rachel>Seriously. Breathe louder, Ross. That's great.

182
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,470
<7-14,Ross>我们应该问医生她知不知道...
<7-14,Ross>We should ask the doctor if she even knows...

183
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,630
<7-14,Ross>怎么接生半人半魔的孩子
<7-14,Ross>...how to deliver a baby that's half human, half pure evil!

184
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,490
<7-15,Rachel>朗医生  你好吗
<7-15,Rachel>Hi, Dr. Long. How are you?

185
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:09,820
<7-16,Ross>你对她倒很好
<7-16,Ross>You're nice to her.

186
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,540
<7-17,Rachel>她手上有药
<7-17,Rachel>She has the drugs.

187
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:16,010
<7-18,Dr. Long>-我帮你快速检查一下  -好的
<7-18,Dr. Long>- We'll do a quick check. - Okay.

188
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:18,830
<7-20,Dr. Long>-已经迟了八天吗  -对
<7-20,Dr. Long>- So eight days late, huh? - Yeah.

189
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:20,140
<7-21,Rachel>你一定觉得很不舒服
<7-21,Rachel>You must be getting a little uncomfortable.

190
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,900
<7-23,Rachel>对  只有一点
<7-23,Rachel>Yeah, just a tad.

191
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,790
<7-24,Dr. Long>宫口已经扩张了八成  就快了
<7-24,Dr. Long>You're 80% effaced. So you're on your way.

192
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:29,210
<7-24,Dr. Long>但你可能还得等上一阵子
<7-24,Dr. Long>It still could last a while longer.

193
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:31,920
<7-24,Dr. Long>如果你很着急  有些方法可以促产
<7-24,Dr. Long>If you're anxious, there are ways to help things along.

194
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,250
<7-25,Ross>那就赶紧的吧
<7-25,Ross>Do them!

195
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:37,320
<7-25,Ross>事实上你们可以自助
<7-25,Ross>Actually, they're things that you can do.

196
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,160
<7-26,Dr. Long>在家里做治疗
<7-26,Dr. Long>Just some home remedies.

197
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:43,090
<7-26,Dr. Long>根据我的经验  我发现有些方法很有效
<7-26,Dr. Long>In my experience, I've found some are very effective.

198
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:45,370
<7-27,Rachel>我们愿意尝试任何方法
<7-27,Rachel>Well, we are ready to try anything.

199
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:48,840
<7-28,Dr. Long>好的  你可以喝一种药草茶
<7-28,Dr. Long>Okay. There's an herbal tea you can drink.

200
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:52,670
<7-30,Dr. Long>你可以喝蓖麻子油  吃辣的食物
<7-30,Dr. Long>You can take some castor oil. There's spicy foods.

201
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,840
<7-31,Rachel>我们全都愿意尝试
<7-31,Rachel>Great. We will do all of those.

202
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:57,200
<7-32,Dr. Long>-长时间散步  -很好  没问题
<7-32,Dr. Long>- Taking a long walk. - Good. Done.

203
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,150
<7-32,Dr. Long>据证实  最有效的方法就是做爱
<7-32,Dr. Long>And there's the one that's proved most effective: Sex.

204
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:09,250
<7-33,Ross>你一定是在开玩笑
<7-33,Ross>You've got to be kidding me!

205
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:27,690
<8-1,Chandler>演得好  乔伊  太棒了  超一流
<8-1,Chandler>Good job, Joe! Well done! Top-notch!

206
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:31,420
<8-2,Joey>-你真的喜欢吗  -当然喜欢
<8-2,Joey>- You liked it? You really liked it? - Oh, yeah!

207
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:34,130
<8-4,Joey>你具体喜欢哪个部份
<8-4,Joey>Well, which part exactly?

208
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,240
<8-5,Chandler>整部电影  我们走吧
<8-5,Chandler>The whole thing! Here we go!

209
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,160
<8-6,Joey>不  说具体一点
<8-6,Joey>No, no, no. Give me some specifics.

210
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,840
<8-7,Chandler>我就喜欢具体细节  细节处理得最棒了
<8-7,Chandler>I loved the specifics. The specifics were the best part.

211
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:46,580
<8-8,Joey>有袋鼠出场的那场戏呢
<8-8,Joey>Hey, what about the scene with the kangaroo?

212
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,560
<8-8,Joey>你喜欢吗
<8-8,Joey>Did you like that part?

213
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,990
<8-9,Chandler>看到一战的电影里出现袋鼠
<8-9,Chandler>I was surprised to see a kangaroo

214
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,290
<8-9,Chandler>我吓了一大跳
<8-9,Chandler>in a World War I epic.

215
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,540
<8-10,Joey>你睡着了
<8-10,Joey>You fell asleep!

216
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,100
<8-10,Joey>电影里面根本没有袋鼠
<8-10,Joey>There was no kangaroo!

217
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,380
<8-10,Joey>我的建议他们一条都没采纳
<8-10,Joey>They didn't take any of my suggestions!

218
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,040
<8-10,Joey>谢谢你来捧场  回头见
<8-10,Joey>Thanks a lot for coming. See you later.

219
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:10,950
<8-10,Joey>别走  我很抱歉
<8-10,Joey>Don't go. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

220
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:12,380
<8-11,Chandler>看  这家伙睡着了
<8-11,Chandler>Look, this guy fell asleep!

221
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:14,490
<8-11,Chandler>他也睡着了  生他的气啊
<8-11,Chandler>He fell asleep too! Be mad at him!

222
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,550
<8-11,Chandler>或是叫救护车来
<8-11,Chandler>Or call an ambulance!

223
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,770
<9-3,Rachel>医生说什么
<9-3,Rachel>What did the doctor say?

224
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,520
<9-4,Monica>知道宝宝何时会出生吗
<9-4,Monica>Any news on when the baby will come?

225
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:31,190
<9-5,Rachel>不知道  她教了我们一些促产的方法
<9-5,Rachel>No. She gave us ideas on how to induce labor.

226
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:32,310
<9-6,Ross>我们都试过了
<9-6,Ross>We tried them all.

227
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:35,410
<9-6,Ross>我们去散了步  喝了茶
<9-6,Ross>We went for a walk, we tried special tea,

228
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:38,780
<9-6,Ross>吃蓖麻子油跟辣的食物  全都没用
<9-6,Ross>castor oil, spicy food. Nothing has worked.

229
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,970
<9-7,Rachel>有个方法我们没试
<9-7,Rachel>There is one thing we didn't try.

230
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:44,040
<9-7,Rachel>但某人觉得那会惹来大麻烦
<9-7,Rachel>But someone thinks that that will open up a can of worms.

231
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:46,870
<9-8,Monica>什么方法
<9-8,Monica>What is it? What is it?

232
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:49,230
<9-8,Monica>如果有办法让宝宝今天就出生
<9-8,Monica>If it's gonna help bring the baby here, today...

233
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,050
<9-8,Monica>我觉得你们应该试试看
<9-8,Monica>I mean, I think you should do it.

234
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:55,760
<9-10,Monica>-我们得做爱  -那就做啊
<9-10,Monica>- It's sex. - Do it!

235
00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:01,110
<9-11,Ross>-莫妮卡  -你们很久没做爱了
<9-11,Ross>- Monica. - It's been a really long time for you.

236
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,830
<9-12,Monica>我是说女人也有需要
<9-12,Monica>I mean, women have needs.

237
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:05,650
<9-12,Monica>快去吧  满足你的需要
<9-12,Monica>Do it. Get yours.

238
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,930
<9-13,Phoebe>这种事我可说不好
<9-13,Phoebe>Oh, I don't know about that.

239
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,450
<9-13,Phoebe>我觉得如果你们两个做了爱
<9-13,Phoebe>I think if the two of you had sex,

240
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:17,740
<9-13,Phoebe>那浮动诊胎法一定会出大问题
<9-13,Phoebe>the repercussions would be catastrophic.

241
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:20,920
<9-13,Phoebe>好吧  我们实际一点

<9-14,Monica>如果罗斯不愿意
<9-14,Monica>If Ross isn't willing to do it,

243

<9-14,Monica>这世上不只有他能跟你做爱
<9-14,Monica>he's not the only guy in the world you can have sex with.

00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,460
<9-14,Monica>你可以借用钱德勒  钱德勒很厉害
<9-14,Monica>You could borrow Chandler. Chandler is good.

<9-15,Ross>莫妮卡  你这是怎么了
<9-15,Ross>Monica, what is the matter with you?

246
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,880
<9-16,Monica>没什么  我只是希望宝宝能在今天出生
<9-16,Monica>Nothing. I just want the baby to be born today.

247
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,290
<9-17,Rachel>为什么一定要是今天

<9-18,Monica>我一直在跟菲比打赌你会生
<9-18,Monica>I keep betting Phoebe that you're gonna have the baby,

250
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,640
<9-18,Monica>我不想再输钱了
<9-18,Monica>and I don't want to lose again.

251
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:50,150
<9-19,Ross>什么  她这么痛苦
<9-19,Ross>What? While she's been going through this hell,

252
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:52,310
<9-19,Ross>你们却在赌钱
<9-19,Ross>you've been making money?

253
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:55,680
<9-19,Ross>你们拿朋友持续经受痛苦来当赌注
<9-19,Ross>You're betting on your friend staying in this misery?

254
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:02,620
<9-20,Rachel>-我也要赌  -什么
<9-20,Rachel>- I'll take that bet. - What?

<9-22,Rachel>我已经够惨了  还不如找点钱赚
<9-22,Rachel>I'm miserable here. I may as well make some money out of it.

256
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:08,920
<9-23,Ross>我也可以加入吗
<9-23,Ross>Can I get some of that action?

257
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:12,350
<9-24,Monica>等等  现在变成我跟你们三个对赌
<9-24,Monica>Wait a minute. I'm betting against all of you?

258
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:15,430
<9-25,Rachel>别担心  我真的觉得明天就要生了
<9-25,Rachel>Don't worry. I really do feel like tomorrow it's gonna happen.

259

<9-25,Rachel>好吧

265
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:39,900
<10-5,Joey>我之所以过来解决我们之间的问题
<10-5,Joey>The reason I came over is to settle things between us.

266

<10-5,Joey>是因为你帮了我很多忙
<10-5,Joey>You've done a lot for me in my career.

00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:41,900
<10-20,Chandler>教你说南方腔
<10-20,Chandler>where you needed a southern accent.

287
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:45,180
<10-20,Chandler>上了20小时的课后  你还是满口牙买加腔
<10-20,Chandler>Which, after 20 hours of lessons, still came out Jamaican.

<11-3,Ross>对了  拿过辣椒之后
<11-3,Ross>By the way, you don't want to touch the pepper

302
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:47,060
<11-3,Ross>别用手摸眼睛
<11-3,Ross>and then touch your eye.

303
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,860
<11-4,Rachel>我什么感觉都没有
<11-4,Rachel>I am feeling nothing.

00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,900
<11-6,Rachel>明知道这招很管用
<11-6,Rachel>We know it's gonna work.

309
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,740
<11-6,Rachel>这是医生的建议

<11-7,Ross>抱歉  但我们总该有点分寸
<11-7,Ross>I'm sorry. But we have to have some boundaries.

314
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,000
<11-8,Rachel>这也算是给我的怀孕期画上圆满句号了
<11-8,Rachel>It'll be a nice way to bookend the pregnancy.

315
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,900
<11-9,Ross>这太疯狂了  我不会因为要让你生孩子
<11-9,Ross>This is insane. I'm not gonna make love to you

316
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,600
<11-9,Ross>就跟你做爱
<11-9,Ross>just so you'll go into labor.

317
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,680
<11-10,Rachel>做爱  你是娘娘腔吗
<11-10,Rachel>Make love? What are you, a girl?

00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:42,020
<11-12,Rachel>把我当成一罐番茄酱
<11-12,Rachel>Think of me as a ketchup bottle.

321
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:45,370
<11-12,Rachel>有时候你得敲敲瓶底才能把番茄酱倒出来
<11-12,Rachel>Sometimes, you have to bang on the end of it to get it to come out.

322
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:51,000
<11-13,Ross>我喜欢你满嘴淫话的样子
<11-13,Ross>I love when you talk dirty to me.

<11-14,Rachel>我知道  你说得对  那样一点都不性感
<11-14,Rachel>I know it. You're right. That's not sexy.
