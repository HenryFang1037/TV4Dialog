1
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:05,650
<1-1,Rachel>听着  先生  我最后一次告诉你
<1-1,Rachel>Listen, you know what, sir, for the last time,

2
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:07,460
<1-1,Rachel>我不管电脑上登记了什么
<1-1,Rachel>I don't care what the computer says.

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:10,890
<1-1,Rachel>我们没从房间冰箱拿走一包糖果
<1-1,Rachel>We did not take a bag of Mashuga Nuts from the minibar.

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:14,740
<1-1,Rachel>我们也没看《热心"助"人的医生》
<1-1,Rachel>And we did not watch Dr. Do-Me-A-Little.

5
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:21,000
<1-3,Phoebe>-乔伊  昨晚你到过我们房间吗  -没有
<1-3,Phoebe>- Joey, were you in our room last night? - No.

6
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:32,410
<1-4,Joey>他们说电影片名不会出现在帐单上
<1-4,Joey>I was told the name of the movie would not appear on the bill.

7
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,140
<1-5,Chandler>我们要退掉新婚套房
<1-5,Chandler>We're checking out of the bridal suite.

8
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:39,160
<1-6,Monica>没错  我不再是新娘了
<1-6,Monica>That's right, I'm no longer a bride.

9
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,960
<1-6,Monica>也永远都当不了新娘
<1-6,Monica>I'll never be a bride again.

10
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,970
<1-6,Monica>现在我不过是某人的太太
<1-6,Monica>Now I'm just someone's wife.

11
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:47,450
<1-7,Chandler>而我是全世界最幸福的男人
<1-7,Chandler>And I'm the happiest guy in the world.

12
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,430
<1-7,Chandler>亲爱的  别难过
<1-7,Chandler>Come on. Honey, don't be upset.

13
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,580
<1-7,Chandler>-我们的未来充满期待  -可不是嘛
<1-7,Chandler>- We still have so much to look forward to. - Yeah, right.

14
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:55,500
<1-9,Chandler>我们还要去度蜜月
<1-9,Chandler>We got the honeymoon.

15
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:57,090
<1-10,Monica>那还要等到星期四
<1-10,Monica>That's not till Thursday.

16
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,340
<1-11,Chandler>还有婚纱照
<1-11,Chandler>The wedding pictures.

17
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:59,970
<1-12,Monica>那得等上好几个星期
<1-12,Monica>It won't be ready for weeks.

18
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:02,620
<1-13,Chandler>但婚宴上用"即可拍"拍的照片马上可以洗好
<1-13,Chandler>Not the disposable cameras from the tables.

19
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:05,720
<1-14,Monica>没错  我就知道我嫁给你是有原因的
<1-14,Monica>That's true. I knew I married you for a reason!

20
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:08,900
<1-15,Chandler>听着  我拿照片去洗  你先回家吧
<1-15,Chandler>Tell you what, I will go get them developed, and you can go home.

21
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,360
<1-16,Monica>好
<1-16,Monica>Okay.

22
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:16,050
<1-17,Chandler>-怎么  你拍了什么  -没什么
<1-17,Chandler>- What? What did you take a picture of? - Nothing.

23
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:18,240
<1-18,Joey>绝对精彩哦
<1-18,Joey>It was something.

24
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,160
<1-19,Chandler>即可拍在罗斯那里  他还没有退房吗
<1-19,Chandler>Ross has the cameras. Has he checked out yet?

25
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:25,880
<1-20,Rachel>你开什么玩笑  退房时间是中午
<1-20,Rachel>Are you joking? Checkout is not till noon.

26
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,210
<1-20,Rachel>-他还有11分钟  -所以呢
<1-20,Rachel>- And he has a good 11 minutes left. - So?

27
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:33,480
<1-22,Monica>罗斯从来不会提早退房  一分钟都不浪费
<1-22,Monica>So Ross had never checked out of a room a minute before he had to.

28
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,450
<1-23,Rachel>我们在交往的时候  有一次延后退房
<1-23,Rachel>One time, when we were dating, we got a late checkout.

29
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:39,690
<1-23,Rachel>他异常兴奋  那是我们最性福的一次
<1-23,Rachel>He got so excited, it was the best sex we ever had.

30
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:43,810
<1-23,Rachel>结果他最后大喊"雷迪森酒店"  真扫兴
<1-23,Rachel>Until he screamed out "Radisson" at the end.

31
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:47,310
<1-24,Chandler>好吧  我去找罗斯拿照相机
<1-24,Chandler>Okay, well, I'm gonna get Ross, get the cameras

32
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,220
<1-24,Chandler>然后把底片拿去洗
<1-24,Chandler>and get them developed.

33
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:54,770
<1-24,Chandler>乔伊  你都32岁了  别那么幼稚行吗
<1-24,Chandler>32, Joe. You're 32!

34
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,120
<1-25,Front Desk Clerk>-这是你的帐单  -谢谢
<1-25,Front Desk Clerk>- Here's a copy of your bill. - Thanks.

35
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:02,340
<1-26,Monica>香槟  草莓...
<1-26,Monica>Champagne, strawberries...

36
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,930
<1-26,Monica>天啊
<1-26,Monica>Oh, my God!

37
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:08,640
<1-26,Monica>我不敢相信钱德勒在我们的新婚之夜看黄片
<1-26,Monica>I can't believe Chandler ordered porn on our wedding night.

38
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:12,300
<1-27,Joey>对  真可悲
<1-27,Joey>Yeah, that's sad.

39
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,070
<1-27,Joey>来点糖果吧
<1-27,Joey>Mashuga Nut?

51
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:02,430
<2-2,Chandler>肥皂  洗发水  你真的要带这些东西吗
<2-2,Chandler>Soaps, shampoos. Are you really taking all this stuff?

52
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:05,150
<2-3,Ross>为什么不行  这全包含在房费里
<2-3,Ross>Why not? It's built into the price of the room.

53
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,250
<2-4,Chandler>对  但你不需要...  这是什么
<2-4,Chandler>Yeah, but you don't need... What is this?

54
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,990
<2-5,Ross>针线包
<2-5,Ross>Thread.

55
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,910
<2-6,Chandler>答对了
<2-6,Chandler>Score!

56
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:16,670
<2-6,Chandler>即可拍在哪里
<2-6,Chandler>Where are the disposable cameras?

57
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:18,400
<2-7,Ross>什么即可拍
<2-7,Ross>What disposable cameras?

58
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:20,940
<2-8,Chandler>昨晚我把它们交给你保管
<2-8,Chandler>The cameras. Remember last night I asked you to take them.

59
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,800
<2-9,Ross>-才没有  -怎么没有  记得吗
<2-9,Ross>- No, you didn't. - Yes, remember?

60
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,810
<2-10,Chandler>在切蛋糕前  我找到你说...
<2-10,Chandler>Right before we cut the cake, I went up to you and I said...

61
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:28,090
<2-11,Ross>对  你问我能不能帮你一个忙
<2-11,Ross>Yeah, you asked me if I could do you a favor.

62
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:31,240
<2-11,Ross>这时墨瑞叔叔走过来交给你一张支票
<2-11,Ross>Then my Uncle Murray came up to you and handed you a check.

63
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:33,250
<2-11,Ross>然后你问"它为什么叫做支票
<2-11,Ross>Then you said, "Why is it called a check?

64
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,270
<2-11,Ross>为什么不叫南斯拉夫人"
<2-11,Ross>Why not a Yugoslavian?"

65
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,230
<2-11,Ross>对  然后你笑得魂不附体
<2-11,Ross>Yeah, then you did that,

66
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:44,610
<2-12,Chandler>-即可拍不在你手上  -没错  抱歉
<2-12,Chandler>- So you don't have the cameras? - No, sorry, man.

67
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:47,260
<2-14,Chandler>那怎么办  相机不见了  莫妮卡会气疯的
<2-14,Chandler>So, what? They're gone? Monica's gonna freak!

68
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,320
<2-15,Ross>它们应该就在酒店里某个地方
<2-15,Ross>I'm sure they're somewhere here in the hotel.

69
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,810
<2-15,Ross>我帮你找
<2-15,Ross>I'll help you look for that.

70
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:53,000
<2-17,Ross>-太棒了  -再等三分钟
<2-17,Ross>- Great. - In three minutes.

71
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,930
<3-2,Monica>你要丢下钱德勒  自己拆礼物吗
<3-2,Monica>Are you gonna open the presents without Chandler?

72
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:17,230
<3-3,Phoebe>不  我只是
<3-3,Phoebe>No! I'm just...

73
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,040
<3-4,Monica>它们在呼换我
<3-4,Monica>They're calling out to me.

74
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,910
<3-4,Monica>这个小家伙甚至都爬到我大腿上了
<3-4,Monica>This little guy even crawled up in my lap.

75
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,200
<3-4,Monica>我就拆一样礼物  钱德勒不会介意的
<3-4,Monica>Chandler wouldn't mind if I opened just one present.

76
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:28,190
<3-4,Monica>你觉得这是什么
<3-4,Monica>What do you think it is?

77
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:32,330
<3-5,Phoebe>是一面小镜子 只要你一照...
<3-5,Phoebe>A little mirror that, when you look into it...

78
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:34,570
<3-5,Phoebe>就会发现自己变成了老太婆
<3-5,Phoebe>...you see yourself as an old woman.

79
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,100
<3-6,Monica>是个迷你盐罐
<3-6,Monica>A tiny salt shaker!

80
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,540
<3-7,Phoebe>天啊  是用来装迷你盐的
<3-7,Phoebe>Oh, my God, for tiny salt!

81
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:47,700
<3-8,Monica>-好吧  拆礼物真好玩  -是啊
<3-8,Monica>- Oh, wow! Okay. Well, that was fun. - Oh, yeah.

82
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,290
<3-9,Phoebe>我会等钱德勒回来
<3-9,Phoebe>Okay, I'll just wait for Chandler

83
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:51,590
<3-10,Monica>-一起拆其他礼物  -好
<3-10,Monica>- to open up the rest of them. - Okay.

84
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,260
<3-12,Monica>但这只是调味瓶组的一部分
<3-12,Monica>Although, you know, this is part of a salt-and-pepper set.

85
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:02,400
<3-12,Monica>它只能算半份礼物  你觉得呢
<3-12,Monica>It may just count as only half a present. What do you think?

86
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,540
<3-13,Phoebe>如果这是一套的
<3-13,Phoebe>I guess it's okay to open one more

87
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,760
<3-13,Phoebe>再拆开一样应该没关系  就这个吧
<3-13,Phoebe>if it's part of a set. It's probably this one.

88
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,350
<3-14,Monica>或是这个
<3-14,Monica>Or this one!

89
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,710
<3-16,Monica>你感觉怎样  晨吐了吗
<3-16,Monica>How are you feeling? Got any morning sickness?

90
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:16,420
<3-17,Rachel>男生们还不知道吧
<3-17,Rachel>The guys don't know yet, do they?

91
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,110
<3-18,Monica>乔伊跟罗斯什么都不知道
<3-18,Monica>No, Joey and Ross don't know anything.

92
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,220
<3-18,Monica>钱德勒还以为是菲比怀孕了
<3-18,Monica>And Chandler still thinks Phoebe's pregnant.

93
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:23,130
<3-19,Phoebe>没错  钱德勒还以为是我怀孕了
<3-19,Phoebe>That's right. Chandler does still think I'm pregnant.

94
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:27,600
<3-19,Phoebe>他没问我感觉如何 也没帮我提袋子
<3-19,Phoebe>He hasn't asked me how I'm feeling or offered to carry my bags.

95
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:30,720
<3-19,Phoebe>我真替跟他在一起的女人觉得难过
<3-19,Phoebe>I feel bad for the woman who ends up with him.

96
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:35,470
<3-19,Phoebe>我是指在你之后的女人
<3-19,Phoebe>After you, of course.

97
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,370
<3-20,Rachel>别担心  你只需要再假装怀孕几小时
<3-20,Rachel>Don't worry. I promise you only have to be pregnant for a few more hours

98
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:41,050
<3-20,Rachel>因为今天我要告诉孩子他爸了
<3-20,Rachel>...because I'm telling the father today.

99
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,850
<3-21,Phoebe>他就住在这栋公寓吗
<3-21,Phoebe>Is it someone in the building?

100
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:45,060
<3-21,Phoebe>是一楼那个高个子吗
<3-21,Phoebe>That tall guy on the first floor?

101
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,680
<3-22,Rachel>才不是呢
<3-22,Rachel>No!

102
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,370
<3-23,Phoebe>怎么  我觉得他很帅啊
<3-23,Phoebe>What? I think he's cute.

103
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:50,120
<3-24,Rachel>那你可以去怀他的孩子
<3-24,Rachel>Then you have his baby.

104
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,950
<3-25,Phoebe>相信我  我正在努力
<3-25,Phoebe>Believe me, I'm trying.

105
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,680
<3-26,Monica>这种感觉真奇怪  你今天就要告诉这个男人
<3-26,Monica>It's so weird. You're gonna tell this guy today...

106
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,910
<3-26,Monica>而他完全不知道会发生什么事
<3-26,Monica>...and he has no idea what's gonna happen.

107
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,820
<3-27,Phoebe>你马上就要敲开他的门
<3-27,Phoebe>Yeah. You're just gonna knock on his door

108
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,720
<3-27,Phoebe>永远改变他的生活
<3-27,Phoebe>and change his life forever.

109
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,650
<3-27,Phoebe>你就像艾德·麦马汉
<3-27,Phoebe>You're like Ed McMahon,

111
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:07,700
<3-27,Phoebe>只是手上没有拿大额支票
<3-27,Phoebe>except without the big check.

112
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,830
<3-27,Phoebe>也缺乏原始的性吸引力
<3-27,Phoebe>Or the raw sexual magnetism.

113
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,130
<3-28,Rachel>对  这确实是个大消息
<3-28,Rachel>Yeah, well, I guess it is pretty big news.

114
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:17,830
<3-28,Rachel>大消息  这可是个天大的消息
<3-28,Rachel>Pretty big? It's huge!

115
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,500
<3-29,Phoebe>天啊  这个男人什么都不知道
<3-29,Phoebe>God, this guy doesn't have a clue.

116
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,030
<3-29,Phoebe>他走在街上心想
<3-29,Phoebe>He's just walking down the street thinking,

117
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:24,080
<3-29,Phoebe>"我跟瑞秋·格林做爱了  我太帅了"
<3-29,Phoebe>"I had sex with Rachel Greene. I rock!"

118
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,260
<3-29,Phoebe>然后  砰  他突然当了爸爸  一切都变了
<3-29,Phoebe>Then, bam! He's a father, everything's different.

119
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:30,590
<3-30,Rachel>除非他真的想当爸爸
<3-30,Rachel>It's only different if he wants it to be.

120
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,700
<3-30,Rachel>我不会对他提出任何要求
<3-30,Rachel>I'm not gonna ask him for anything.

121
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,910
<3-31,Phoebe>他还是得做出重大的决定
<3-31,Phoebe>Okay, then. He still has this huge decision to make.

122
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:36,170
<3-31,Phoebe>现在他边走边想
<3-31,Phoebe>Now he's walking around thinking,

123
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:38,580
<3-31,Phoebe>"我要当爸爸吗"  然后  砰
<3-31,Phoebe>"Do I want to be a dad?" Then, bam!

124
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:40,660
<3-32,Monica>这次怎么了
<3-32,Monica>What was that "bam"?

125
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:44,610
<3-33,Phoebe>我不知道  他可能是被公车撞了
<3-33,Phoebe>I don't know. He's hit by a bus, or something.

126
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:50,280
<3-34,Joey>乔伊  如果跟你上过床的女人

00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,030
<7-5,Woman At The Wedding>咔嚓
<7-5,Woman At The Wedding>Click.

242
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,850
<7-6,Ross>-我没有听到快门声  -我听到了
<7-6,Ross>- It didn't click. - I heard it. I heard it.

243
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:33,550
<7-7,Man At The Wedding>但闪光灯没亮
<7-7,Man At The Wedding>But there was no flash.

244
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:35,530
<7-8,Woman At The Wedding>你为什么不帮我们拍照
<7-8,Woman At The Wedding>Why won't you take our picture?

245
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,960
<7-9,Chandler>好  我来帮你们拍
<7-9,Chandler>Oh, yeah. I'll take your picture.

246
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:42,510
<7-10,Man At The Wedding>你的手指挡到镜头了
<7-10,Man At The Wedding>Your finger was covering the lens.

247
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:45,170
<7-11,Chandler>你是安瑟·亚当斯吗  快滚吧
<7-11,Chandler>Who are you, Ansel Adams? Get out of here!

249
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:53,910
<8-1,Phoebe>之前吓到你了  我真的很过意不去
<8-1,Phoebe>Look, I feel really bad about how I freaked you out before...

250
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:55,930
<8-1,Phoebe>所以我打电话把孩子他爸叫到这里见你
<8-1,Phoebe>...so I called the father and asked the father to meet you here

251
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:57,220
<8-1,Phoebe>你可以告诉他事实  去吧
<8-1,Phoebe>so you could tell him. Go!

252
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:59,130
<8-1,Phoebe>什么  等一下
<8-1,Phoebe>What? Wait a minute.

253
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:01,580
<8-2,Rachel>你怎么知道孩子他爸是谁
<8-2,Rachel>Phoebe, how do you even know who the father is?

254
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,450
<8-3,Phoebe>或许有时候我会装傻
<8-3,Phoebe>I may play the fool at times...

255
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:09,310
<8-3,Phoebe>但事实上我是个永不放弃的金发美女
<8-3,Phoebe>but I'm more than a pretty blond girl with an ass that won't quit.

256
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:14,620
<8-3,Phoebe>我相信这是孩子他爸的衣服
<8-3,Phoebe>I believe this belongs to the father of your baby...

257
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,030
<8-4,Rachel>天啊
<8-4,Rachel>Oh, God.

258
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,030
<8-4,Rachel>他就在里面吗
<8-4,Rachel>He's in there right now?

259
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:24,740
<8-5,Phoebe>你可以转身离开  或是长痛不如短痛
<8-5,Phoebe>You can turn around, or you can go rip the Band-Aid off.

260
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,050
<8-5,Phoebe>你打算怎么做
<8-5,Phoebe>What do you want to do?

261
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,710
<8-7,Phoebe>-我们把事情做个了断吧  -你确定
<8-7,Phoebe>- Let's rip. - Are you sure?

<10-1,Tag>这是怎么一回事
<10-1,Tag>So, what's this about?

278
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,650
<10-2,Phoebe>瑞秋有事要告诉你
<10-2,Phoebe>Rachel has something she wants to tell you.

279
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:05,880
<10-2,Phoebe>我敢肯定这是你的红毛衣
<10-2,Phoebe>And I believe that this is your red sweater.

280
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:10,300
<10-3,Tag>不  这才是我的红毛衣
<10-3,Tag>No, this is my red sweater.

281
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,090
<10-4,Phoebe>不是吧
<10-4,Phoebe>Oh, no.

282
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,110
<10-4,Phoebe>有人要喝咖啡吗
<10-4,Phoebe>Could I get anyone a coffee?

283
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:23,390
<10-4,Phoebe>或是毒药  没有吗  只有我要喝  好吧
<10-4,Phoebe>Or poison? No? Just for me? Okay.

284
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,960
<10-5,Tag>发生了什么事  瑞秋
<10-5,Tag>What's going on, Rach?

285
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:31,370
<10-6,Rachel>没事  菲比搞错了
<10-6,Rachel>Nothing. Phoebe kind of made a mistake.

286
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:34,080
<10-6,Rachel>但你的确常穿那件毛衣
<10-6,Rachel>But you do wear that sweater a lot.

287
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,760
<10-6,Rachel>你这是在玩什么"大冒险"吗
<10-6,Rachel>Are you involved in some kind of dare?

288
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:40,670
<10-7,Tag>事实上我很高兴能接到菲比的电话
<10-7,Tag>I'm actually glad Phoebe called.

289
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:48,010
<10-7,Tag>我知道我们会分手是因为你觉得我太幼稚
<10-7,Tag>I know we broke up because you thought I was immature enough,

290
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:49,620
<10-7,Tag>但我已经长大了
<10-7,Tag>but I've really grown up.

291
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,590
<10-7,Tag>我觉得我们应该复合
<10-7,Tag>I think we should get back together.

292
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,920
<10-8,Rachel>时机不对
<10-8,Rachel>It's just not the right time.

293
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,100
<10-9,Tag>-时机非常恰当  -好吧
<10-9,Tag>- It is the right time. - Okay.

<10-11,Tag>我做了万全的准备
<10-11,Tag>I'm ready for more.

295
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,160
<10-12,Rachel>-泰格  -来吧  瑞秋我们再试一次
<10-12,Rachel>- Tag. - Come on, Rach. Let's give it another try.

00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:05,200
<10-14,Rachel>我怀孕了
<10-14,Rachel>I'm having a baby.

297
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:15,800
<10-14,Rachel>-你可以走了  -谢谢
<10-14,Rachel>- You can go. - Thank you.

298
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,640
<11-1,Monica>我不知道这些礼物怎么会是打开的
<11-1,Monica>I don't know how any of these got opened!

299
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:26,620
<11-2,Joey>你拆开了所有的礼物
<11-2,Joey>You opened them all?

300
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:29,560
<11-3,Monica>我知道  我太不靠谱了
<11-3,Monica>I know, I know I am a terrible person.

301
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:33,050
<11-3,Monica>钱德勒再也不会相信我了
<11-3,Monica>Chandler's never gonna trust me with anything ever again.

302
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,920
<11-4,Joey>你拆开了我爸妈的礼物
<11-4,Joey>You got my parents' gift.

303
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,190
<11-5,Monica>那是什么
<11-5,Monica>Yeah. What is that?

304
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,570
<11-6,Joey>应该是跟意大利腊肠有关的东西
<11-6,Joey>I don't know. I think it does something to salami.

305
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:46,440
<11-8,Joey>-情况如何  -泰格怎么说
<11-8,Joey>- How'd it go? - What did Tag say?

306
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,950
<11-9,Rachel>泰格不是孩子他爸  乔伊竟然知道了
<11-9,Rachel>Tag is not the father. And Joey knows now?

307
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:53,620
<11-10,Joey>我知道了  瑞秋  我为你感到高兴
<11-10,Joey>I do, Rach, I do. And I am so happy for you.

308
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:00,660
<11-11,Rachel>你竟然没想要解开我的胸罩
<11-11,Rachel>Wow, you didn't even try to unook my bra.

309
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:05,070
<11-12,Monica>你还打算要告诉孩子他爸吗
<11-12,Monica>So are you ever gonna tell whoever it is?

310
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:08,330
<11-13,Rachel>我会的  我只是不想今晚告诉他
<11-13,Rachel>I will. I'm just not up for it tonight.

311
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:10,400
<11-14,Joey>不论这家伙怎么说
<11-14,Joey>Rach, no matter what this guy says,

312
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:12,420
<11-14,Joey>你都不会独自面对这一切
<11-14,Joey>I want you to know you're not gonna be alone in this.

313

<11-14,Joey>-是吗  -不  听着...
<11-14,Joey>- I'm not? - No. Listen, I...

314
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,620
<11-15,Rachel>外面的世界很可怕
<11-15,Rachel>It's a scary world out there,

315
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:23,260
<11-15,Rachel>特别是对单亲妈妈来说
<11-15,Rachel>especially for a single mom.

316
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:28,860
<11-16,Joey>我一直觉得我跟你之间有种特殊的联系
<11-16,Joey>I've always felt like you and I have this special bond, you know?

317
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:32,050
<11-16,Joey>-瑞秋·格林  你愿意嫁给我吗  -什么
<11-16,Joey>- Rachel Greene, will you marry me? - What?

<11-25,Phoebe>我不能说我不心痛
<11-25,Phoebe>I can't say that didn't hurt.

<11-25,Phoebe>但我会原谅你  乔伊·崔比安尼

341
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,620
<11-38,Chandler>从你脸上的表情看来
