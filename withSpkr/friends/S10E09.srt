1
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:06,010
<5-2,Joey>-嘿   -嘿
<5-2,Joey>- Hey.  - Hey.

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:07,380
<1-3,Monica>我们来道别
<1-3,Monica>We're here to say goodbye.

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:08,520
<1-4,Chandler>要去俄亥俄州
<1-4,Chandler>We're off to Ohio.

4
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:10,710
<1-5,Phoebe>对哦  领养面谈
<1-5,Phoebe>Oh, right, your adoption interview.

5
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,360
<1-6,Monica>是啊  我们去见未来我们孩儿他妈
<1-6,Monica>Yep. We'll meet the lady who could be carrying our baby.

6
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,880
<1-7,Joey>难以置信  你们回来时
<1-7,Joey>I can't believe it. When you come back,

7
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:18,280
<1-7,Joey>会带着婴儿  太奇怪了
<1-7,Joey>you'll have a baby. That is so weird.

8
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:20,110
<1-8,Chandler>也很不正确
<1-8,Chandler>And so incorrect.

9
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:22,860
<1-9,Monica>她只怀孕几个月
<1-9,Monica>She's only a couple months pregnant.

10
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:23,800
<1-9,Monica>她选中了我们的申请表
<1-9,Monica>She liked our application

11
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,180
<1-9,Monica>是否喜欢我们还不一定
<1-9,Monica>but might not like us.

12
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,390
<1-10,Ross>她会喜欢你们的
<1-10,Ross>Come on, she's gonna love you guys.

13
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,220
<1-10,Ross>谢谢
<1-10,Ross>Thank you.

14
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:30,280
<1-11,Chandler>但我们尽量不期望过高
<1-11,Chandler>But we're trying not to get our hopes up.

15
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:31,920
<1-12,Monica>还有很多事情挡在我们面前
<1-12,Monica>A lot could still get in our way.

16
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:33,910
<1-13,Chandler>她可能会决定拒绝把孩子给人领养
<1-13,Chandler>She could decide against adoption,

17
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,470
<1-13,Chandler>也可能选中其他夫妇
<1-13,Chandler>like another couple better.

18
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,980
<1-14,Phoebe>你们打算给小孩取啥名字
<1-14,Phoebe>What are you gonna name it?

19
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:38,640
<1-15,Chandler>我就有这个本事
<1-15,Chandler>I could develop a condition

20
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:39,500
<1-15,Chandler>费尽口舌
<1-15,Chandler>in which I talk and talk

21
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:41,250
<1-15,Chandler>而旁人却充耳不闻
<1-15,Chandler>and no one hears a word.

22
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,800
<1-16,Joey>试想  如果一切顺利
<1-16,Joey>But just think, okay? What if everything goes right?

23
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:48,040
<1-16,Joey>如果她真选了你们俩呢
<1-16,Joey>What if this woman does pick you guys?

24
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:52,290
<1-17,Monica>天  那她就会选我们
<1-17,Monica>Oh, my God. She's gonna pick us!

25
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:53,590
<1-18,Chandler>我们决心
<1-18,Chandler>So we're standing firm on

26
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,040
<1-18,Chandler>决不期望过高
<1-18,Chandler>"not getting our hopes up"?

27
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,810
<1-19,Monica>我明白  有可能出差错
<1-19,Monica>No. I know things could still go wrong,

28
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:58,850
<1-19,Monica>但万一顺利
<1-19,Monica>but if they don't...

29
00:00:58,900 --> 00:00:59,860
<1-19,Monica>如果没有问题
<1-19,Monica>...if this works out,

30
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:01,800
<1-19,Monica>我们就会有孩子了  孩子
<1-19,Monica>we're gonna have a baby. A baby!

32
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:03,970
<1-21,Monica>会成功的

<3-18,Erica>您竟然还娶了个牧师
<3-18,Erica>But on top of it, you're married to a reverend?

152
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,800
<4-8,Joey>聊得开心

00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:12,800
<4-8,Joey>我也觉得她很酷
<4-8,Joey>I was thinking she was really cool.

154
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,050
<4-8,Joey>然后  突然间...
<4-8,Joey>And then, out of nowhere...

155
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:39,810
<4-8,Joey>就这样
<4-8,Joey>That's it?

156
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,550
<5-1,Phoebe>这就是你不想再跟她约会的理由
<5-1,Phoebe>That's why you won't go out with her again?

157
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,210
<5-1,Phoebe>不就吃了你的薯条吗  有什么大不了
<5-1,Phoebe>So she took some fries. Big deal.

158
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:46,990
<5-2,Joey>我不是气她吃我几根薯条
<5-2,Joey>Hey, look, it's not about a few fries.

159
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,960
<5-2,Joey>你得清楚薯条的象征意义
<5-2,Joey>It's about what the fries represent.

160
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:51,090
<5-4,Joey>-啥  -所有食物
<5-4,Joey>- What?  - All food!

163
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:57,400
<5-5,Phoebe>和这么个"怪物"约会

<5-6,Joey>我带女孩吃饭
<5-6,Joey>Hey, look, I take a girl out...

166
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:02,920
<5-6,Joey>越多越好
<5-6,Joey>The more the better, all right?

167
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:04,090
<5-6,Joey>但不可以自己
<5-6,Joey>Just don't order

168
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:06,680
<5-6,Joey>只点沙拉却夺我的食物
<5-6,Joey>a garden salad and then eat my food!

169
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,080
<5-6,Joey>这么做有可能被切手指的
<5-6,Joey>That's a good way to lose some fingers.

170
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,200
<5-8,Rachel>谢天谢地你来了  你来评评理

173
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:17,730
<5-11,Phoebe>在吃晚饭的时候
<5-11,Phoebe>having dinner, and she reaches over...

174
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:21,570
<5-11,Phoebe>-她伸手拿他的薯条  -哦  不
<5-11,Phoebe>- ...and takes a few of his fries--  - Oh, no!

175
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:23,070
<5-12,Rachel>这有什么
<5-12,Rachel>What?

176
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,470
<5-13,Phoebe>你知道这条规则
<5-13,Phoebe>You know about the plate thing?

177
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,210
<5-13,Phoebe>是是  乔伊从不分享食物
<5-13,Phoebe>Oh, yeah, yeah. No, Joey doesn't share food.

178
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:33,020
<5-14,Rachel>上星期我们一起吃早餐
<5-14,Rachel>I mean, just last week we were having breakfast...

00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:35,040
<5-14,Rachel>他盘里有些葡萄
<5-14,Rachel>...and he had a couple grapes on his plate.

180
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:36,590
<5-15,Phoebe>你不让她吃葡萄
<5-15,Phoebe>You wouldn't let her have a grape?

181
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,840
<5-16,Rachel>不  不是我

184
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,220
<5-18,Phoebe>我还是坚持认为就因为这件破事
<5-18,Phoebe>Well, I still think that is a stupid reason

185
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,660
<5-18,Phoebe>放弃她很不明智
<5-18,Phoebe>not to call someone again.

186
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:54,820
<5-18,Phoebe>你再约她  好吧
<5-18,Phoebe>You are calling her, okay?

187
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,050
<5-18,Phoebe>如果有必要
<5-18,Phoebe>And if you need to,

188
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,790
<5-18,Phoebe>干脆再点一盘薯条不就完了
<5-18,Phoebe>then just get an extra plate of fries for the table.

189
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,800

242
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:14,680
<7-1,Chandler>我是医生
<7-1,Chandler>So the fact that I'm a doctor

243
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,600
<7-1,Chandler>我太太是牧师
<7-1,Chandler>and my wife's a reverend...

244

246
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,330
<7-2,Erica>但是我想
<7-2,Erica>...but I thought,

247
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,250
<7-2,Erica>带孩子谁能比得上牧师
<7-2,Erica>"Who better than a minister to raise a child?"

248
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,630
<7-3,Monica>阿门
<7-3,Monica>Amen.

249
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:30,340
<7-4,Chandler>另外  我觉得把孩子交给个医生是很好的
<7-4,Chandler>Plus, I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor.

250
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:32,020
<7-5,Monica>很好的一双手
<7-5,Monica>Good hands.

<7-5,Monica>Healing hands.

252
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,570
<7-6,Erica>牧师  我能问一下
<7-6,Erica>Reverend, can I ask?

253
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,850
<7-6,Erica>圣经上对领养孩子怎么说吗
<7-6,Erica>Does the Bible say anything about adoption?

254
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,310
<7-7,Monica>但做无妨
<7-7,Monica>It says, "Do it."

255
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:47,330
<7-7,Monica>她让他们领养了一个婴孩
<7-7,Monica>"And behold, she did adopt unto them a baby.

257
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:51,260
<7-7,Monica>此乃善举
<7-7,Monica>And it was good."

258
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:55,730
<7-9,Chandler>-哇  -是啊  我也哇
<7-9,Chandler>- Wow.  - Yeah, wow.

259
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:59,940
<7-10,Erica>我在想  你们工作都责任重大
<7-10,Erica>I was wondering-- You both have such serious jobs.

260
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:02,870
<7-10,Erica>你有时间兼顾孩子和你的教友吗
<7-10,Erica>Would you have time to take care of a baby and your flock?

261
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,150
<7-11,Monica>我的教友  我的教友们没事儿
<7-11,Monica>Oh, no, my flock? My flock is good.

262
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,880
<7-11,Monica>这个时候  我的教友都是自己照顾自己
<7-11,Monica>Yeah. My flock pretty much takes care of themselves by this point.

263
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:11,350
<7-11,Monica>好教友  教友...
<7-11,Monica>Good flock. Flock...

264
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:15,970
<7-12,Erica>当医生很花时间吧
<7-12,Erica>But being a doctor, that must take up a lot of time.

265
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:18,190
<7-13,Chandler>我的情况不同
<7-13,Chandler>Not for me it doesn't.

266
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:21,510
<7-14,Agency guy>谈得如何
<7-14,Agency guy>So how's everything going in here?

267
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,590
<7-15,Erica>太棒了
<7-15,Erica>We're great.

268
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,190
<7-15,Erica>我想问题我都问完了
<7-15,Erica>I think I may have asked all my questions.

269
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,250
<7-16,Agency guy>很好  你们有什么要问她
<7-16,Agency guy>Good. Do you have questions for Erica?

270
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,970
<7-17,Chandler>我想问问
<7-17,Chandler>Yeah, actually.

271
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,390
<7-17,Chandler>你读到满意的申请表
<7-17,Chandler>So you read a file that you liked...

272
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,340
<7-17,Chandler>然后告诉代理人编号
<7-17,Chandler>...and then you gave the agency the serial number

273
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,950
<7-17,Chandler>然后他们联系到我们
<7-17,Chandler>and they contacted us?

274
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,430
<7-18,Agency guy>我们的系统中用户完全匿名
<7-18,Agency guy>Yes. Our system ensures total anonymity.

275
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,890
<7-18,Agency guy>我们以此为荣
<7-18,Agency guy>We're very proud of it.

276
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,190
<7-19,Chandler>应该骄傲
<7-19,Chandler>You should be.

277
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:42,270
<7-19,Chandler>真的是一流
<7-19,Chandler>You're really on top of stuff.

278
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:45,570
<7-20,Agency guy>别的没什么了
<7-20,Agency guy>Well then, if there's nothing else,

279
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,170
<7-20,Agency guy>那我们俩谈谈
<7-20,Agency guy>then the two of us should talk.

280
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,710
<7-20,Agency guy>实际上…
<7-20,Agency guy>I actually....

281
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,310
<7-21,Erica>-我想我们不必谈了 -为什么不
<7-21,Erica>- I don't think we have to. - We don't?

282
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,820
<7-23,Erica>我看了你们的档案
<7-23,Erica>Yeah, when I read about you two,

283
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,420
<7-23,Erica>就确定要选你们
<7-23,Erica>I was pretty sure I wanted you...

284
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:57,150
<7-23,Erica>但还想当面见见你们
<7-23,Erica>...but I just thought we should meet face to face.

285
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:59,040
<7-23,Erica>我决定了
<7-23,Erica>I've made my decision.

286
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,590
<7-23,Erica>就选他们
<7-23,Erica>I choose them.

287
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:04,330
<7-24,Monica>哦  天啊  太棒了
<7-24,Monica>Oh, my God, this is great.

288
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,500
<7-24,Monica>太棒了  听见吗
<7-24,Monica>This is so great. Did you hear that?

289
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,160
<7-25,Chandler>是的  听见了
<7-25,Chandler>Yeah, I did.

290
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:09,320
<7-25,Chandler>嘿

292
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:17,040
<7-26,Monica>你将来一定进天堂
<7-26,Monica>You are so going to heaven!

293
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,820
<8-1,Rachel>我们买了些很棒的东西
<8-1,Rachel>We got some really great stuff.

294
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,030
<8-1,Rachel>对
<8-1,Rachel>Yeah.

295
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:29,720
<8-2,Phoebe>但是  有些胸罩似乎不妥
<8-2,Phoebe>Yeah, but I'm not sure about some of the bras I got.

296
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:32,130
<8-3,Rachel>真的  你能穿上试给我看吗
<8-3,Rachel>Really? Do you want to try some of them on for me?

297
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:33,400
<8-3,Rachel>好
<8-3,Rachel>Okay.

298
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,590
<8-4,Phoebe>等一下  我们是在乔伊的幻想里吗
<8-4,Phoebe>Wait, are we in Joey's imagination?

299
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:42,590
<8-5,Rachel>糟糕  错拿罗斯一袋
<8-5,Rachel>Oh, no. I took one of Ross' bags by mistake.

300
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,220
<8-5,Rachel>我那件不见了
<8-5,Rachel>And one of mine is missing.

301
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:45,650
<8-6,Phoebe>肯定在罗斯那里
<8-6,Phoebe>Ross probably has it.

302
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,240
<8-6,Phoebe>找他拿回来好了
<8-6,Phoebe>You'll get it from him later.

303
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,580
<9-1,Ross>你觉得如何
<9-1,Ross>So, what do you think?

304
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:00,980
<9-2,Joey>这下我们再也撞不了衫了
<9-2,Joey>I think we're not wearing the same shirt anymore.

305
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:04,900
<9-3,Ross>对  瑞秋帮我选的
<9-3,Ross>Yeah. Yeah, Rachel picked it out for me.

306
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,420
<9-3,Ross>她让我相信她
<9-3,Ross>She told me to trust her, and you know what?

307
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:07,690
<9-3,Ross>真高兴我答应了
<9-3,Ross>I'm glad I did.

308
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:10,140
<9-3,Ross>一路过来回头率暴高
<9-3,Ross>I turned quite a few heads on my way over here.

309
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:15,280
<9-4,Joey>老兄  别穿成这样
<9-4,Joey>Dude, I really don't think you should be wearing that.

310
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,790
<9-5,Ross>我明白
<9-5,Ross>I see.

311
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:21,340
<9-5,Ross>有人怕我抢走了女人的目光
<9-5,Ross>Somebody's afraid of a little competition with the ladies?

312
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,950
<9-6,Joey>看起来好用某人就是个女人了
<9-6,Joey>Looks like someone is the ladies!

313
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:29,220
<9-7,Ross>你嫉妒  因为你不能把这件扒下来
<9-7,Ross>You're just jealous because you couldn't pull this off.

314
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,970
<9-7,Ross>现在失陪了  我约会去
<9-7,Ross>Yeah. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a date.

315
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,520
<9-7,Ross>看到没  大家都只看我
<9-7,Ross>See? All eyes on me!

316
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:46,360
<10-1,Chandler>不能签
<10-1,Chandler>We are not signing those papers.

317
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:47,750
<10-2,Monica>为啥
<10-2,Monica>Why not?

318
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,290
<10-3,Chandler>这样做不对  他们搞错了
<10-3,Chandler>It's wrong. They made a mistake.

319
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,690
<10-3,Chandler>当我们是别人
<10-3,Chandler>They think we're somebody else.

320
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:54,110
<10-4,Monica>上帝的安排  凡人懂什么
<10-4,Monica>God works in mysterious ways.

321
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,680
<10-5,Chandler>别再冒充了
<10-5,Chandler>You have got to stop.

322
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,360
<10-6,Monica>但她喜欢我们
<10-6,Monica>But she liked us.

323
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:01,010
<10-7,Chandler>她喜欢的是钱德勒医生
<10-7,Chandler>She likes Doctor Chandler

324
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,370
<10-7,Chandler>和莫妮卡牧师
<10-7,Chandler>and Reverend Monica.

325
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,250
<10-8,Monica>如果你想一下
<10-8,Monica>If you think about it,

326
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,030
<10-8,Monica>我其实满像牧师
<10-8,Monica>I'm kind of like a reverend.

327
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,790
<10-8,Monica>作为主厨  我给饥饿的人和穷人提供食物
<10-8,Monica>I mean, as a chef, I serve God

328
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,740
<10-8,Monica>这不也是为上帝服务
<10-8,Monica>by feeding the hungry and poor.

329
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:16,310
<10-9,Chandler>你们一份小牛排卖34块9毛5
<10-9,Chandler>Your veal chop is 34.95!

330
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:18,760
<10-9,Chandler>得了
<10-9,Chandler>Come on,

331
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:20,880
<10-10,Monica>幸福来敲门了
<10-10,Monica>I just-- I think we've been given an opportunity.

332
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:22,470
<10-10,Monica>不如将错就错
<10-10,Monica>The mistake's already made.

333
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,060
<10-10,Monica>他们已经在写书面报告了
<10-10,Monica>They're writing up the papers now.

334
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:26,020
<10-11,Chandler>但我们不是她要选的人
<10-11,Chandler>But we're not the ones she chose.

335
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:28,430
<10-11,Chandler>你竟然理直气壮
<10-11,Chandler>How can you feel okay about this?

336
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:31,360
<10-11,Chandler>因为…
<10-11,Chandler>Because.

337
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:35,230
<10-12,Monica>虽然我们不是她选中的人
<10-12,Monica>We may not be who she thinks we are...

338
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,060
<10-12,Monica>但没人会比我们更爱那个小娃娃
<10-12,Monica>...but no one will ever love that baby more than us.

339
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,160
<10-14,Monica>-我明白  -我的意思是
<10-14,Monica>- I know.  - I mean, who knows...

340
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:41,650
<10-14,Monica>谁知道我们到底还要等多久
<10-14,Monica>...how long it's gonna take for someone else

341
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,200
<10-14,Monica>才会有人再选我们
<10-14,Monica>to give us a baby?

342
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,900
<10-14,Monica>万一永远没人选我们
<10-14,Monica>What if no one ever picks us?

343
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:47,530
<10-15,Chandler>哦  亲爱的
<10-15,Chandler>Oh, honey....

344
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,210
<10-16,Monica>求你了
<10-16,Monica>Please?

345
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:51,880
<10-16,Monica>求你了  我们就快要成功了
<10-16,Monica>Please. We are so close.

346
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:55,950
<10-17,Chandler>莫妮卡  我也想要孩子
<10-17,Chandler>Monica, I want a baby too.

347
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,870
<10-17,Chandler>但她要送出他的心肝宝贝
<10-17,Chandler>But this woman is giving away her child.

348
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,750
<10-17,Chandler>她应该知道对方的真实身份
<10-17,Chandler>She deserves to know who it's going to.

349
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:10,940
<10-18,Monica>好吧  你说的没错
<10-18,Monica>Okay. You're right.

350
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:15,750
<10-19,Chandler>我们告诉她真相
<10-19,Chandler>So we'll tell the truth.

351
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,930
<10-19,Chandler>但是谁知道呢
<10-19,Chandler>And who knows, you know?

352
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,860
<10-19,Chandler>没准她会因为我们告诉她真相而喜欢我们
<10-19,Chandler>Maybe she'll like us for us.

353
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,310
<10-20,Monica>或许她会
<10-20,Monica>Maybe she will.

354
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,620
<10-20,Monica>我怎么就不是牧师呢
<10-20,Monica>Why couldn't I have been a reverend?

355
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:28,120
<10-21,Chandler>你是犹太教的
<10-21,Chandler>You're Jewish.

356
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:31,900
<10-22,Monica>差别不大

<11-16,Sarah>但你说过"我的就是你的"
<11-16,Sarah>But you said, "What's mine is yours."

377
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:57,950
<11-17,Joey>我那是客气
<11-17,Joey>Well, I didn't mean it!

378
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:01,370
<11-18,Sarah>好吧  对不起
<11-18,Sarah>Fine. Sorry,

00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,700
<11-18,Sarah>没想到你这么在乎
<11-18,Sarah>I didn't think it was that big a deal.

380
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:07,210
<11-18,Sarah>不  我很抱歉
<11-18,Sarah>No, I'm sorry. I....

381
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,540
<11-19,Joey>是我反应过激了
<11-19,Joey>I'm overreacting, okay?

382
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:12,140
<11-19,Joey>在食物方面
<11-19,Joey>It's just, when it comes to food, l...

00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:13,540
<11-19,Joey>我有一些戒律

<11-19,Joey>...there are things you do,

386
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:20,340
<11-19,Joey>有些事是禁止的
<11-19,Joey>and, you know, things that you don't do.

387
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,530
<12-1,Girl>这儿很不错
<12-1,Girl>Wow, this place looks great.

388
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:30,940

<12-2,Ross>Oh, you are gonna love it.

389
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:34,190
<12-2,Ross>真高兴我们终于能一起吃饭了
<12-2,Ross>And I'm so glad we're finally doing this.

<12-4,Ross>刚才的事真抱歉
<12-4,Ross>I really am sorry about, you know, before.

393
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,650
<12-4,Ross>你一定要知道

394
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,100

<13-1,Joey>I really do like you.

395
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:05,070
<13-2,Sarah>是啊  但是没有喜欢蛤蚌那么多
<13-2,Sarah>Sure, just not as much as clams.

396
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,770
<13-3,Joey>蒸粉蚌
<13-3,Joey>Well, stuffed clams....

397
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:10,840
<13-4,Waiter>女士要的巧克力甜品
<13-4,Waiter>Chocolate torte for the lady.

<13-4,Waiter>男士的奶酪蛋糕
<13-4,Waiter>Cheesecake for the gentleman.

399
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:14,430
<13-5,Joey>先生
<13-5,Joey>Excuse me, sir.

400
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,500
<13-5,Joey>我的蛋糕好像有些红的乱七八糟的东西
<13-5,Joey>There seems to be some sort of red crap on my cheesecake.

401
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,470
<13-6,Waiter>是的  那是覆盆子酱汁
<13-6,Waiter>Yes, that's a raspberry coulis.

402
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:23,170
<13-7,Joey>点奶酪蛋糕真够蠢
<13-7,Joey>I'm so stupid ordering cheesecake,

403
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:24,790
<13-7,Joey>还想说吃健康食品
<13-7,Joey>trying to be healthy.

404
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:39,840
<13-11,Sarah>哦  不
<13-11,Sarah>Oh, no.

<13-12,Sarah>失陪
<13-12,Sarah>Can you excuse me?

<13-13,Joey>当然 请便  没问题
<13-13,Joey>Yeah, sure. No problem.

408
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:48,970
<13-14,Sarah>干嘛
<13-14,Sarah>What are you doing?

409
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:51,200
<13-14,Sarah>你不是不和人分享食物
<13-14,Sarah>I thought you don't share food?

410
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,680
<13-15,Joey>才没有
<13-15,Joey>Sure I do.

411
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:54,010
<13-15,Joey>覆盆子酱汁

412
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:57,940
<13-16,Sarah>不  我都不能吃你的蛤蚌
<13-16,Sarah>No. If I can't have your clams,

413
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:59,220
<13-16,Sarah>你也不能碰我的甜品
<13-16,Sarah>you can't have my dessert.

414
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,570
<13-16,Sarah>规则是双向的
<13-16,Sarah>This is a two-way street.

415
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,530
<13-17,Joey>是吗
<13-17,Joey>Really?

416
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:07,060
<13-17,Joey>是的
<13-17,Joey>Really.

417
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:10,040
<13-18,Sarah>我回来时希望它完好无损
<13-18,Sarah>Now this all better be here when I come back.

418
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:13,510
<13-19,Joey>当然  我能控制自己
<13-19,Joey>Yeah, of course. I can control myself.

419
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:28,120
<13-20,Joey>别再瞪着我
<13-20,Joey>Stop staring at me!

420
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,940
<13-21,Joey>就一小口
<13-21,Joey>Just a tiny little....

421
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,730
<14-2,Adoption Agency guy>我甚至不感觉抱歉
<14-2,Adoption Agency guy>I'm not even sorry.

422
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,610
<14-3,Chandler>-嗨   -嗨
<14-3,Chandler>- Hi.  - Hey.

423
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,080
<14-4,Agency guy>领养的初步手续就这些了
<14-4,Agency guy>So these are the preliminary forms for an open adoption.

424
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,500
<14-4,Agency guy>有很多东西要看
<14-4,Agency guy>There's a lot to go over,

425
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:12,420
<14-4,Agency guy>但是过的时候我会一一解释
<14-4,Agency guy>but I'll explain as we go through.

426
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:16,670
<14-5,Monica>-孩子的照片   -对
<14-5,Monica>- Is that a picture? - Yeah.

<14-6,Erica>是上周给小婴儿拍的B超
<14-6,Erica>It's a sonogram they took of the baby last week.

428
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,180
<14-6,Erica>你们也许有兴趣看看
<14-6,Erica>I thought you might want to see it.

429
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:30,170
<14-7,Monica>医生快看
<14-7,Monica>Look, doctor.

430
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,110
<14-7,Monica>签字前
<14-7,Monica>Look, before we sign anything,

431
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,990
<14-8,Agency guy>我们得谈谈
<14-8,Agency guy>we really have to talk.

432
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,410
<14-8,Agency guy>我们不是你选中的夫妇
<14-8,Agency guy>We're not who you think we are.

433
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,820
<14-8,Agency guy>什么意思
<14-8,Agency guy>I don't understand.

434
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:46,660
<14-9,Chandler>领养机构肯定出了什么错
<14-9,Chandler>The agency must have made a mistake.

435
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:47,920
<14-9,Chandler>我太太不是牧师
<14-9,Chandler>My wife is not a reverend,

436
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:49,560
<14-9,Chandler>我不是医生
<14-9,Chandler>and I'm not a doctor.

437
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,660
<14-11,Agency guy>-啊   -不可能
<14-11,Agency guy>- What? - That's impossible.

438
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,380
<14-12,Chandler>如果你愿意  我可以替你开刀
<14-12,Chandler>I could perform an operation on you

439
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:54,910
<14-12,Chandler>向你证明
<14-12,Chandler>and prove it if you'd like.

440
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,600
<14-13,Agency guy>我去查档案  失陪
<14-13,Agency guy>I have to check your file. Excuse me.

441
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:01,550
<14-14,Erica>你们到底是谁
<14-14,Erica>So who are you?

442
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,140
<14-15,Chandler>我们是叫莫妮卡和钱德勒  纽约来的
<14-15,Chandler>Our names really are Monica and Chandler. We're from New York.

443
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:07,410
<14-16,Monica>但重要的是
<14-16,Monica>Yeah, but the important thing to know about us...

444
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:10,980
<14-16,Monica>我们真的很爱这个小孩
<14-16,Monica>...is how much we would care for this little baby.

445
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:13,190
<14-17,Erica>你们先前跟我撒谎
<14-17,Erica>So you lied to me before?

446
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,740
<14-18,Monica>我们"犯了伪证罪"
<14-18,Monica>Well, we "bore false witness."

447
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:20,120
<14-18,Monica>看  我真有当牧师的天赋
<14-18,Monica>See? I could be a reverend.

448
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,220
<14-19,Erica>我真不敢相信
<14-19,Erica>I can't believe this.

449
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,830
<14-20,Monica>我们希望说明真相后
<14-20,Monica>But we were hoping that since we told you the truth...

450
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,480
<14-20,Monica>你能网开一面...
<14-20,Monica>...that you still might consider--

451
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:29,330
<14-21,Erica>把我的宝贝给你们
<14-21,Erica>Giving you my baby?

452
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:31,790
<14-21,Erica>发生这一切后  你们以为还会给你们
<14-21,Erica>You think I'd give you my child after this?

453
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,920
<14-22,Monica>不必马上决定
<14-22,Monica>You don't have to decide now.

454
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:34,490
<14-22,Monica>请看看我们的档案
<14-22,Monica>If you look at our file--

455
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:37,140
<14-23,Erica>没兴趣  到此为止
<14-23,Erica>I don't want to look at your file. This is over.

456
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,460
<14-24,Chandler>艾瑞卡  请等等
<14-24,Chandler>Erica, wait.

457
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,830
<14-25,Erica>我跟你无话可说
<14-25,Erica>I have nothing to say to you.

458
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,210
<14-26,Chandler>你有任何理由生气
<14-26,Chandler>Look, you have every reason to be upset.

459
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,850
<14-26,Chandler>我们是撒了谎
<14-26,Chandler>We did lie.

460
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,590
<14-26,Chandler>但那是因为
<14-26,Chandler>But only because we've been waiting

461
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,290
<14-26,Chandler>我们想要个孩子等太久了
<14-26,Chandler>and trying to have a baby for so long.

462
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:56,040
<14-26,Chandler>我们也不知道下一个机会
<14-26,Chandler>And we don't know how long it's gonna be

463
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:57,720
<14-26,Chandler>何年何月才会到来
<14-26,Chandler>before we get another chance again.

464
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,020
<14-27,Erica>让你的牧师祈祷去吧
<14-27,Erica>Why don't you ask the reverend to pray on it?

465
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:03,000
<14-28,Chandler>艾瑞卡  求你了
<14-28,Chandler>Erica, please.

466
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:05,140
<14-28,Chandler>考虑一下我们吧
<14-28,Chandler>Just consider us.

467
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:07,110
<14-28,Chandler>找他们要我们的资料
<14-28,Chandler>Ask them to see our file.

468
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,570
<14-28,Chandler>我们姓宾
<14-28,Chandler>Our last name's Bing.

469
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:12,330
<14-28,Chandler>我太太是个主厨  我从事广告业
<14-28,Chandler>My wife's a chef, and I'm in advertising.

470
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:14,920
<14-28,Chandler>嗯
<14-28,Chandler>Oh, yeah.

471
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:17,550
<14-29,Erica>我的确喜欢你们
<14-29,Erica>I actually liked you guys.

472
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:20,390
<14-29,Erica>但已经不重要了
<14-29,Erica>But it doesn't matter.

473
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,680
<14-29,Erica>你们不该撒谎
<14-29,Erica>Because what you did was wrong.

474
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,840
<14-29,Erica>但你喜欢我们对不对
<14-29,Erica>But you did like us.

475
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,220
<14-30,Chandler>你也应该喜欢我们
<14-30,Chandler>And you should.

476
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:29,200
<14-30,Chandler>我太太是个很了不起的女人
<14-30,Chandler>My wife's an incredible woman.

477
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:33,240
<14-30,Chandler>她有爱心  乐于奉献  关怀他人
<14-30,Chandler>She is loving, and devoted and caring.

478
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:35,630
<14-30,Chandler>别告诉她我这么说过
<14-30,Chandler>And don't tell her I said this,

479
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,320
<14-30,Chandler>但她一贯正确
<14-30,Chandler>but the woman's always right.

480
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,650
<14-30,Chandler>我爱我太太胜过世上一切事物
<14-30,Chandler>I love my wife more than anything in this world.

481
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,710
<14-30,Chandler>所以...
<14-30,Chandler>And it...

482
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:52,110
<14-30,Chandler>不能给她个孩子我难受死了
<14-30,Chandler>It kills me that I can't give her a baby.

483
00:22:58,010 --> 00:22:59,880
<14-30,Chandler>我很想要个孩子
<14-30,Chandler>I really want a kid.

484
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:02,700
<14-30,Chandler>有了孩子以后
<14-30,Chandler>And when that day finally comes,

485
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,760
<14-30,Chandler>我会学习如何做是个好爸爸
<14-30,Chandler>I'll learn how to be a good dad.

486
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,060
<14-30,Chandler>但我太太...
<14-30,Chandler>But my wife...

487
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:09,760
<14-30,Chandler>她已经是个好妈妈
<14-30,Chandler>...she's already there.

488
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,010
<14-30,Chandler>她是一个妈妈
<14-30,Chandler>She's a mother...

489
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:15,170
<14-30,Chandler>可惜没孩子
<14-30,Chandler>...without a baby.

490
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:24,300
<14-31,Chandler>求你了
<14-31,Chandler>Please?

491
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,130
<14-31,Chandler>你还想要那个孩子吗
<14-31,Chandler>You still want that baby?

492
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:56,520
<14-32,Monica>上帝保佑你  钱德勒·宾
<14-32,Monica>God bless you, Chandler Bing!

493
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:13,210
<15-1,Ross>原来这件毛衣是女款的
