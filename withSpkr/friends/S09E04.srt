00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,260
<4-5,Joey>我看过这棵古怪的植物
<4-5,Joey>I know I've seen this weird plant before.

133
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,800
<4-5,Joey>它上次也是这样刺我
<4-5,Joey>It did that the last time!

00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:59,470
<4-5,Joey>没错  我们在这沙发上做过爱
<4-5,Joey>Yeah! We had sex on this couch!

136

138
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:08,450
<4-5,Joey>这倒是很奇怪  看起来超适合的
<4-5,Joey>which is weird,because it seems like a perfectly good place.

139
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,210
<4-5,Joey>这就是原因
<4-5,Joey>That's why.

<5-5,Ross>我真的非常需要跟你谈一件事
<5-5,Ross>I really,really need to talk to you about something.

146
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:35,410
<5-6,Mike>除非

147
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,880
<5-6,Mike>你不是要拉我信什么邪教吧

00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,030
<5-11,Ross>我是个蠢蛋
<5-11,Ross>I'm an idiot,okay?

155
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,880
<5-11,Ross>就在你们出去约会前
<5-11,Ross>Right before you guys went out..

156
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,560
<5-11,Ross>我不小心惹得她很难过
<5-11,Ross>I accidentally got her all upset.

157
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:06,190
<5-12,Mike>难怪她不对劲
<5-12,Mike>That's why she was weird.

<5-13,Ross>是的  是啊  我
<5-13,Ross>Yes. Yeah,I..

159
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,090
<5-13,Ross>我说了些蠢话
<5-13,Ross>Yeah,I said something stupid

160
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:12,000
<5-13,Ross>关于她从没有过认真的恋爱关系等等
<5-13,Ross>about her never having had a serious relationship.

161
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:12,710
<5-13,Ross>但是你应该知道
<5-13,Ross>But you should know,

<5-13,Ross>她是很风趣  很棒的一个人

00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:32,180
<5-15,Ross>好吧  那我就不需要再打扰你了
<5-15,Ross>Well,then,I didn't need to bother you.

00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,920
<5-16,Mike>菲比从未谈过认真的恋爱
<5-16,Mike>Phoebe's never had a serious relationship?

175
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,730
<5-17,Ross>她当然有过
<5-17,Ross>Of course she has.

176
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,460
<5-17,Ross>如果她没有谈过认真的恋爱
<5-17,Ross>If she's never had a serious relationship..

<5-17,Ross>你认为我会到处去广播
<5-17,Ross>do you think I'd go around broadcasting it..

178
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:58,350
<5-17,Ross>像是无法克制的白痴一样吗
<5-17,Ross>like some kind of unstoppable moron?

179
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:00,600
<5-18,Mike>但你的确是那样说了
<5-18,Mike>But you did say it.

206
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:05,120
<7-2,Monica>正在自慰
<7-2,Monica>molesting himself.

207
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:08,350
<7-3,Rachel>那画面可不是很好看
<7-3,Rachel>That couldn't have been pretty.

208
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,510
<7-3,Rachel>但你知道的  男人常那样做的

209
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:12,760
<7-4,Monica>是吗  但是  很奇怪的是

<8-1,Rachel>你确定他是在做那档事吗
<8-1,Rachel>Are you sure that's what he was doing?

215
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:33,150
<8-2,Monica>你知道我看他那样
<8-2,Monica>You know how many times I've seen him

216
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,950
<8-2,Monica>跳起来多少次了吗

219
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,360
<8-3,Rachel>我就知道那家伙有地方不对劲
<8-3,Rachel>I always knew there was something weird about that dude.

220
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:46,730
<8-3,Rachel>你发誓过无论如何都要爱他的
<8-3,Rachel>You promised to love him no matter what.

221
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,750
<8-4,Monica>"无论如何"意思是像如果他得病
<8-4,Monica>"What" means,like,if he gets a disease

222
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,870
<8-4,Monica>或者杀了人什么的
<8-4,Monica>or kills someone.

223
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:54,210
<8-4,Monica>而不是如果  他把小弟弟放到鲨鱼嘴里
<8-4,Monica>Not if he gets his jollies to Jaws.

224
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:58,510
<8-5,Rachel>其实  亲爱的  男人是很不一样的
<8-5,Rachel>You know what,honey? Guys are just different.

<8-5,Rachel>他们喜欢一些我们无法理解的东西

00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,760
<8-6,Monica>你是在说我哥吗
<8-6,Monica>Are you talking about my brother?

232
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:18,090
<8-7,Rachel>我装得不像  对不对
<8-7,Rachel>I didn't disguise that very well,did I?

<8-10,Joey>到一半的时候才发现
<8-10,Joey>Halfway through our date I realized..

235
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:28,140
<8-10,Joey>我已经跟她上过床了
<8-10,Joey>I already slept with her.

<8-11,Rachel>你已经跟全纽约的女人上过床了
<8-11,Rachel>You've slept with all the women in N.Y.,

237
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,290
<8-11,Rachel>现在又开始新的一轮吗
<8-11,Rachel>and now you're going around again?

238
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,240
<8-12,Joey>那不是最奇怪的地方
<8-12,Joey>That's not even the weird part.

239
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,660
<8-12,Joey>她竟然不记得跟我上过床了
<8-12,Joey>She didn't remember sleeping with me!

<8-13,Monica>你也不记得跟她上过床啊
<8-13,Monica>You don't remember sleeping with her.

241
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,000
<8-14,Joey>但是她应该要记得我的
<8-14,Joey>But she should remember sleeping with me.

242
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,420
<8-14,Joey>我可是很令人难忘的
<8-14,Joey>I am very memorable!

<8-15,Rachel>-你们知道的  -我们怎么会知道呢
<8-15,Rachel>- You guys know. - How do we know?

244
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,790
<8-15,Rachel>我们又没跟你上过床
<8-15,Rachel>We've never slept with you.

245
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:50,600
<8-16,Joey>那是谁的错呢
<8-16,Joey>And whose fault is that?

246
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:52,900
<8-17,Monica>又没有什么大不了的
<8-17,Monica>What's the big deal?

247
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,600
<8-17,Monica>你忘了  她忘了
<8-17,Monica>You forgot,she forgot.

248
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:57,670
<8-17,Monica>-或许那晚你床上表现不佳  -嘿
<8-17,Monica>- Maybe you were having an off night. - Hey!

<8-18,Joey>I never have an off night. Okay?

250
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,650
<8-18,Joey>虽然有时候如果我吃太饱
<8-18,Joey>Although,sometimes if I'm a little bloated,

251
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:06,750
<8-18,Joey>可能就不会觉得很性感
<8-18,Joey>I don't feel that sexy.

00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:05,970
<9-6,Ross>我过去找他  告诉他

279
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:31,690

<9-10,Ross>Well,he seemed..

280
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,640
<9-10,Ross>有点惊讶  因为我对他说

281
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:37,810
<9-10,Ross>你从未谈过认真的恋情

286
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:56,290
<9-12,Ross>我想如果你知道多一点关于维克莱的事

287
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:58,790
<9-12,Ross>你会感觉好多了

<9-15,Phoebe>如果他无法接受 那他可以离开
<9-15,Phoebe>You know? If he can't handle it,then he can leave.

299
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:33,600

<9-15,Phoebe>Which he will.

300
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:36,060
<9-15,Phoebe>而这一切都没有关系

301
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,960
<9-15,Phoebe>我只不过会永远孤单而已

339
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,810
<11-1,Phoebe>你不能每次寂寞就打电话给我
<11-1,Phoebe>you can't just call every time you get lonely. You know.

340
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,720
<11-1,Phoebe>你已经没有那个资格了
<11-1,Phoebe>You gave up that right

341
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,680
<11-1,Phoebe>因为你跟瑞秋上床了
<11-1,Phoebe>when you slept with Rachel."

342
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,980
<11-2,Mike>瑞秋  她不是才刚生下罗斯的小孩吗
<11-2,Mike>Rachel? I thought she just had a baby with Ross.

343
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:41,120
<11-3,Phoebe>是啊  嗯
<11-3,Phoebe>Yeah,well..

344
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:43,120
<11-3,Phoebe>是啊
<11-3,Phoebe>Yeah.

345
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,340
<11-3,Phoebe>艾玛的出生证明上
<11-3,Phoebe>But Emma's birth certificate

346
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,560
<11-3,Phoebe>或许生父是罗斯
<11-3,Phoebe>might say "Geller"..

347
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,980
<11-3,Phoebe>但是她眉眼长得像维克莱
<11-3,Phoebe>but her eyes say "Mukherjee."

348
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:54,830
<11-4,Mike>实在太不对了 而且他还吸毒
<11-4,Mike>That is so wrong. And on top of that,he's a glue sniffer?

349
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,110
<11-5,Phoebe>我知道  但是他打来时
<11-5,Phoebe>I know. But he calls,

350
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,940
<11-5,Phoebe>我的心就飞向他了
<11-5,Phoebe>and my heart goes to him.

351
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,290
<11-5,Phoebe>你知道的  那个浑蛋
<11-5,Phoebe>You know,that bastard

352
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:03,410
<11-5,Phoebe>是个很会花言巧语的风筝设计师
<11-5,Phoebe>is one smooth-talking freelance kite designer.

353
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:07,710
<11-6,Mike>我觉得有更好的人在等着你
<11-6,Mike>I think there's somebody better out there for you.

354
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,600
<11-6,Mike>我是说  你知道的  我
<11-6,Mike>I mean,you know,I'm..

355
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,080
<11-6,Mike>我不是指我  但是
<11-6,Mike>I'm not saying me,but..

356
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:15,450
<11-6,Mike>或许  是我
<11-6,Mike>Maybe.. me.

357
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:20,450
<11-8,Mike>而且你不用担心我会吸毒
<11-8,Mike>And you don't have to worry about glue-sniffing with me.

358
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:24,360
<11-8,Mike>虽然有时候我会闻马克笔的味道
<11-8,Mike>Although,I do smell the occasional Magic Marker.

359
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,970
<11-8,Mike>是啊  反正  我只是
<11-8,Mike>Yeah. Anyway,I just..

361
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:37,840
<11-9,Phoebe>-好吧  我编不下去了  -怎么了
<11-9,Phoebe>- Okay,I can't do this. - What's wrong?

362
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:42,040
<11-10,Mike>根本没有维克莱这个人  罗斯乱扯的
<11-10,Mike>Well,there is no Vikram. Ross made him up.

363
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,680
<11-10,Mike>因为我
<11-10,Mike>Because I..

396
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,370
<12-7,Chandler>为什么要我看一群鲨鱼游来游去呢
<12-7,Chandler>Why am I watching a bunch of sharks swimming around?

397
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,970
<12-8,Monica>这不是  这不是你爱看的吗
<12-8,Monica>Is this..? Is this not the good part?

<12-10,Monica>不过他们倒是有一部叫"鳄鱼杀手"的
<12-10,Monica>Though they did have something called Crocodile Killers.

403
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:09,330
<12-11,Chandler>难道你非要鲨鱼不可吗
<12-11,Chandler>Or does it always have to be sharks?

404
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,490
<12-11,Chandler>为什么我非要鲨鱼不可
<12-11,Chandler>Does what always have to be sharks?

00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,210
<12-18,Monica>那为什么你一边看着他们
<12-18,Monica>Then why were you watching them

416
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:45,570
<12-18,Monica>一边自慰呢
<12-18,Monica>and giving yourself a treat?

<12-19,Chandler>我本来只是在看一般的色情片
<12-19,Chandler>I was just watching regular porn.

420
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:54,730
<12-20,Monica>真的吗
<12-20,Monica>Really?

421
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:56,520
<12-21,Chandler>是的  只不过是一些正常  老套
<12-21,Chandler>Yes. Just some good,old-fashioned,

<12-21,Chandler>美式的女对女爱情动作片

427
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:14,390
<12-23,Chandler>你哪里来的力量和谅解
<12-23,Chandler>Where do you find the strength and the understanding

428
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:15,800
<12-23,Chandler>去这样做呢
<12-23,Chandler>for something like that?

429
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:19,920
<12-24,Monica>因为我现在非常  非常地醉

431
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,530
<13-1,Joey>但是我的自信已经动摇了

433
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:36,560
<13-2,Phoebe>或许该是你反省的时候了
<13-2,Phoebe>Maybe this is a wake-up call.

434

<13-2,Phoebe>检讨你的整个约会态度

00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,320
<13-2,Phoebe>女人从一个换到另一个
<13-2,Phoebe>Here you go from woman to woman..

<13-2,Phoebe>从来不去担心
<13-2,Phoebe>Never even worrying

441
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:53,690
<13-2,Phoebe>那些恋情无法发展到谈婚论嫁的阶段
<13-2,Phoebe>that it doesn't turn into something more serious.

442
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:56,560
<13-3,Joey>你说的没错  我爱死我的人生了
