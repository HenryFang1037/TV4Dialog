4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:10,870
<1-6,Ross>去之前问一句
<1-6,Ross>Before we do,

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,160
<1-6,Ross>里面没有乔伊的"浪漫"杂志吧
<1-6,Ross>are any of Joey's special "romance" magazines in there?

00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:31,640
<1-13,Rachel>可以帮我个大忙吗
<1-13,Rachel>Could you do me a big favor?

11
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,640
<1-14,Ross>院长办公室召开紧急会议
<1-14,Ross>The dean's office just called and said there was an urgent meeting.

00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,480
<1-14,Ross>你能帮我照看本一小时吗
<1-14,Ross>Can you watch Ben for an hour?

13
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:40,750
<1-15,Rachel>-莫妮卡呢  -她不在家
<1-15,Rachel>- What about Monica? - She isn't home.

14
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:44,730
<1-17,Rachel>就我一个人吗
<1-17,Rachel>So it would just be me alone?

15
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,240
<1-18,Ross>还有本
<1-18,Ross>Ben would be there.

16
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,010
<1-20,Ross>怎么了
<1-20,Ross>What's the matter?

17

<1-21,Rachel>只是...
<1-21,Rachel>Well that... you know it's just uh,

<1-21,Rachel>我以前从来没跟他单独待过
<1-21,Rachel>I've never done that before. Me and him, alone.

19
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,060
<1-22,Ross>他又不是前科犯
<1-22,Ross>Rach, he's not an ex-con.

20
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,050
<1-23,Rachel>好  好...
<1-23,Rachel>Okay, okay...

21
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:04,250
<1-23,Rachel>-我要陪他做什么  -聊聊天
<1-23,Rachel>- What do I do with him? - I don't know, talk to him.

22
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,860
<1-24,Ross>陪他玩  保他不死就行
<1-24,Ross>Entertain him. Keep him alive.

23
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,930
<1-25,Rachel>-好  -本  来

<1-26,Ross>I'm gonna leave you here

25
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,270
<1-26,Ross>和瑞秋阿姨一起待一小时  好吗
<1-26,Ross>with Aunt Rachel for about an hour, okay?

26
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:16,590
<1-26,Ross>可以吗
<1-26,Ross>Gonna be okay?

27
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:19,190
<1-27,Rachel>-可以  -我没跟你说话
<1-27,Rachel>- I think so. - I wasn't talking to you.

39
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:00,180
<2-1,Monica>我们见的第二位牧师如何  我还蛮喜欢他的
<2-1,Monica>What about the second minister we meet with? I kind of liked him.

40
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,680
<2-2,Chandler>你是指口沫横飞那位
<2-2,Chandler>You mean the spitter?

41
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,540
<2-3,Monica>别这样  他喷得也没那么厉害
<2-3,Monica>Come on. He wasn't that bad.

42
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:07,120
<2-4,Chandler>你说起来容易  你到时候有面纱遮脸
<2-4,Chandler>Easy for you to say, you'd be wearing a veil.

43
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,400
<2-6,Chandler>-那第三位呢  -他一直瞪着你的胸部看
<2-6,Chandler>- What about the third guy? - He kept staring at your chest.

44
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,860
<2-7,Monica>这你能怪他吗
<2-7,Monica>Can you blame him?

45
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,870
<2-8,Chandler>我不希望我说"我愿意"时...
<2-8,Chandler>I don't like the idea of me saying, "I do"...

46
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:20,650
<2-8,Chandler>他心里想着"我也愿意"
<2-8,Chandler>...while he's thinking, "I'd do it too."

47
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,310
<2-9,Monica>-这个问题还是有待解决  -什么问题
<2-9,Monica>- Well, then we still have a problem. - With what?

48
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,480
<2-12,Monica>我们需要找人帮我们主持婚礼
<2-12,Monica>We're trying to find someone to perform our wedding

49
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,920
<2-12,Monica>但他们要么无趣  要么烦人
<2-12,Monica>and they're all either boring or annoying

50
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,680
<2-12,Monica>要么一直盯着我的咪咪看
<2-12,Monica>or can't stop staring at the ladies.

51
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:38,010
<2-13,Phoebe>应该找我们其中一人来主婚
<2-13,Phoebe>You should have one of us do it.

52
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,710
<2-14,Monica>我们是要正经八百地结婚
<2-14,Monica>Phoebe, we're getting "married" married,

53
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:41,660
<2-14,Monica>不是小孩过家家
<2-14,Monica>not "6th-grade" married.

54
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:43,940
<2-15,Phoebe>我是说正经的
<2-15,Phoebe>No, it's a real thing.

55
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,430
<2-15,Phoebe>任何人都能在网络上被任命为牧师
<2-15,Phoebe>Anyone can be ordained on the Internet

56
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:48,100
<2-15,Phoebe>然后主持婚礼
<2-15,Phoebe>and perform weddings and stuff.

57
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,610
<2-17,Phoebe>我要
<2-17,Phoebe>I call it!

58
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,830
<2-18,Joey>干嘛  这可是我的主意
<2-18,Joey>What? It was my idea!

59
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:56,490
<2-20,Chandler>真心谢谢你们  但你们谁也不能替我们主婚
<2-20,Chandler>Guys, thank you very much, but neither of you is marrying us.

60
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:59,260
<2-21,Joey>现在喊"我要"都不管用了吗
<2-21,Joey>Does calling it not mean anything anymore?

61
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,600
<2-22,Chandler>我们要找一位正规的牧师
<2-22,Chandler>We're having a legitimate clergy member.

62
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,390
<2-22,Chandler>我说的正规是指  他得是同性恋...
<2-22,Chandler>And when I say legitimate, I mean gay...

63
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:07,990
<2-22,Chandler>而且能控制住不喷口水
<2-22,Chandler>...and in control of his saliva.

64
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:22,370
<3-1,Rachel>本  你还是个小婴儿的时候
<3-1,Rachel>Ben, you know, when you were a baby...

65
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:24,750
<3-1,Rachel>我们经常待在一起
<3-1,Rachel>...you and I used to hang out all the time.

66
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,550
<3-1,Rachel>那时我是你爸的女朋友
<3-1,Rachel>I was your daddy's girlfriend.

67
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:29,360
<3-2,Ben>可你现在不是了
<3-2,Ben>But you're not anymore.

68
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:33,750
<3-4,Ben>-对  我不是了  -因为你们当时分开了
<3-4,Ben>- No, I'm not. - Because you guys were on a break...

69
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,840
<3-5,Rachel>喂  我们没...
<3-5,Rachel>Hey, we were not on a...

70
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:44,150
<3-6,Ben>-我爸什么时候会回来  -再过52分钟
<3-6,Ben>- When's my daddy coming back? - 52 minutes.

71
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,470
<3-7,Rachel>你没有兄弟姐妹是吧
<3-7,Rachel>So no brothers or sisters, huh?

72
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:54,000
<3-9,Rachel>我有两个姐妹  我们会互相折磨
<3-9,Rachel>You know what, I had two sisters and we just tortured each other.

73
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,170
<3-10,Ben>-真的吗  说说看  -我们会...
<3-10,Ben>- Really? Like how? - Well, you know, we would...

74
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,900
<3-11,Rachel>重复另一个人说的每一句话
<3-11,Rachel>...we'd repeat everything the other said...

75
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,670
<3-11,Rachel>或是从衣柜跳出去吓人
<3-11,Rachel>...or we'd jump out of closets to scare each other...

76
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:06,820
<3-11,Rachel>或是把糖换成盐
<3-11,Rachel>...or switch the sugar with salt

77
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,580
<3-11,Rachel>让别人把盐洒到麦片里
<3-11,Rachel>so they put salt on their cereal.

78
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:11,070
<3-12,Ben>这个好玩
<3-12,Ben>That's a good one.

79
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:14,800
<3-13,Rachel>-你喜欢吗  -是  你很有意思
<3-13,Rachel>- Yeah, you like that one? - Yeah, you're funny.

80
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,240
<3-14,Ben>我很有意思
<3-14,Ben>I'm funny?

81
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,510
<3-14,Ben>谢天谢地
<3-14,Ben>Oh, thank God.

82
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:20,530
<3-15,Rachel>我有一大堆这种故事
<3-15,Rachel>Well, hey, I got a ton of these.

83
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,640
<3-15,Rachel>拿一枚25分硬币
<3-15,Rachel>You take a quarter...

84
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,390
<3-15,Rachel>拿一枚25分硬币
<3-15,Rachel>You take a quarter...

85
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:28,190
<3-15,Rachel>把边缘涂黑
<3-15,Rachel>...and you blacken the edge, right?

86
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,650
<3-15,Rachel>然后说  我打赌  你拿这枚硬币从额头
<3-15,Rachel>And then you say to a person, "I bet you can't roll this quarter

87
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:34,430
<3-15,Rachel>滚到下巴  一定会离开你的脸
<3-15,Rachel>from your forehead to your chin without it leaving your face."

88
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:35,320
<3-15,Rachel>等他们真的滚了
<3-15,Rachel>And when they do it,

89
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:40,180
<3-16,Ben>就会在脸正中央留下一条黑线
<3-16,Ben>they're left with a line down the center of their face.

90
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,510
<3-16,Ben>我可以对你这样吗
<3-16,Ben>Can I do it to you?

91
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:46,790
<3-17,Rachel>本  我是幽默  但我不笨
<3-17,Rachel>I'm funny, Ben, but I'm not stupid.

92
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,990
<4-1,Joey>你们找到婚礼主持了吗
<4-1,Joey>So did you find anyone to marry you yet?

93
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:58,700
<4-2,Chandler>没有  但"痴想莫妮卡"牧师打电话来了
<4-2,Chandler>No, but "Horny for Monica" minister called...

94
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:02,180
<4-2,Chandler>想知道我们是否还在一起
<4-2,Chandler>...wondering if we're still together.

95
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,950
<4-4,Joey>-我们找不到合适的人选了  -那就让我来
<4-4,Joey>- We'll never find anybody. - Then let me do it.

96
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,860
<4-6,Joey>-乔伊  -我考虑过了
<4-6,Joey>- Joey... - I've been thinking about it.

97
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:11,230
<4-6,Joey>我是个演员  所以在人前发言不会紧张
<4-6,Joey>I'm an actor, so I won't get nervous talking in front of people.

98
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:15,280
<4-8,Joey>我不会喷口水  也不会瞪着莫妮卡的胸部看
<4-8,Joey>I won't spit and I won't stare at Monica's breasts.

99
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:19,020
<4-8,Joey>大家都知道我对臀部情有独钟
<4-8,Joey>Everyone knows I'm an ass man.

100
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,220
<4-10,Joey>-那倒是真的  -最重要的是
<4-10,Joey>- That's true. - The most important thing...

101
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:25,860
<4-10,Joey>你们不必找个几乎不了解你们的陌生人
<4-10,Joey>...is, it won't be some stranger who barely knows you.

102
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:29,690
<4-10,Joey>而是我这个朋友  我保证会出色完成任务
<4-10,Joey>It'll be me. And I swear, I'll do a really good job.

103
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:34,220
<4-10,Joey>还有  我爱你们  这件事对我意义重大
<4-10,Joey>Plus, I love you guys and it would really mean a lot to me.

104
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,710
<4-12,Monica>还挺带劲的
<4-12,Monica>Might be kind of cool.

105
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:39,150
<4-13,Joey>-我可以主婚吗  -好吧  可以
<4-13,Joey>- So I can do it? - Yeah, you can do it.

106
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:42,030
<4-14,Chandler>太棒了
<4-14,Chandler>All right! Okay!

107
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:44,900
<4-15,Joey>好  我要开始准备演说了
<4-15,Joey>Okay, I gotta get started on my speech.

108
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,780
<4-15,Joey>等一下
<4-15,Joey>Wait a minute.

109
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:50,160
<4-15,Joey>-网络上任命的牧师可以做爱吧  -对
<4-15,Joey>- Internet ministers can have sex, right? - Yeah.

110
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,710
<5-2,Ross>我要找你算账
<5-2,Ross>I have a bone to pick with you.

111
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,300
<5-3,Rachel>-惨了  -没错
<5-3,Rachel>- Uh-oh. - Yes.

112
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:13,500
<5-4,Ross>本学会了一个恶作剧
<5-4,Ross>Ben learned a little trick.

113
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,620
<5-5,Rachel>-他是不是...  -对  是的
<5-5,Rachel>- Oh, did he pull the old...? - That's right. That's right.

114
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:23,150
<5-6,Ross>在马桶座上包上保鲜膜
<5-6,Ross>Saran wrap on the toilet seat...

115
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:26,550
<5-6,Ross>这样尿尿就会喷得到处都是
<5-6,Ross>...so the pee goes everywhere.

116
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:30,690
<5-7,Rachel>-那招啊  -对  就是那招
<5-7,Rachel>- Oh, that. - Yeah, that.

117
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:33,120
<5-8,Ross>你知道我最恨恶作剧了
<5-8,Ross>You know I hate practical jokes.

118
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,770
<5-8,Ross>恶作剧又毒又蠢
<5-8,Ross>They're mean, they're stupid

119
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:37,000
<5-8,Ross>我不想让我儿子学这种东西
<5-8,Ross>and I don't want my son learning them.

120
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,370
<5-8,Ross>别这样
<5-8,Ross>Come on.

121
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:41,650
<5-9,Rachel>马桶包保鲜膜  你没觉得有一点点好笑吗
<5-9,Rachel>Saran wrap on the toilet seat? Isn't that just a little funny?

122
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:44,470
<5-10,Ross>我当时赤着脚
<5-10,Ross>I was barefoot.

123
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:49,690
<5-10,Ross>你只有教他马桶这一招  对吧
<5-10,Ross>Tell me, the toilet thing is the only thing you taught him, right?

124
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,080
<5-11,Rachel>对
<5-11,Rachel>Yes.

125
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,980
<6-17,Chandler>向乔伊·崔比安尼牧师问好吧
<6-17,Chandler>Say hello to Reverend Joey Tribbiani.

126
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,950
<6-18,Phoebe>-你被任命了  -对
<6-18,Phoebe>- You got ordained? - Yeah.

127
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,890
<6-19,Monica>我刚刚下网  网上有好多色情片

<7-12,Ben>"记得我昨天教你的那些东西吗"
<7-12,Ben>"Remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday?"

<7-13,Rachel>-别学我  -"别学我"
<7-13,Rachel>- Don't do that. - "Don't do that."

00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,550
<7-14,Ben>你爸爸不喜欢恶作剧
<7-14,Ben>Seriously, your dad doesn't like pranks.

162
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:16,120
<7-15,Rachel>"你爸爸不喜欢恶作剧"
<7-15,Rachel>"Seriously, your dad doesn't like pranks."

<7-19,Rachel>别学这句
<7-19,Rachel>No! Don't say that.

165
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,600
<7-21,Rachel>-该死  -你还是接着重复我的话吧
<7-21,Rachel>- Damn it! - Go back to repeating.

169
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,970
<8-5,Chandler>好啊
<8-5,Chandler>Yeah, okay.

170
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:41,630
<8-6,Joey>当我想起这两位付出者
<8-6,Joey>"When I think of the love that these two givers

171
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,710
<8-6,Joey>和接受者所分享的爱...
<8-6,Joey>and receivers share...

172
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:48,840
<8-6,Joey>我禁不住嫉妒他们将来一生的拥有  相爱
<8-6,Joey>...I can't help but envy the lifetime ahead of having and loving...

173
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:52,900
<8-6,Joey>与付出  我想不出这儿要用什么词
<8-6,Joey>...and giving..." And then I can't think of a good word for right here.

174
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:56,250
<8-7,Monica>-用"接受"如何  -对
<8-7,Monica>- How about "receiving"? - Yes!

175
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:01,850
<8-8,Joey>乔伊  不是说你写的词不好
<8-8,Joey>See, Joe, not that that's not great...

176
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:06,840
<8-9,Chandler>但朋友主婚的好处就在于
<8-9,Chandler>...but one cool thing about having a friend perform the ceremony...

177
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,740
<8-9,Chandler>婚礼可以围绕我们展开
<8-9,Chandler>...is that it can be about us.

178
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:12,870
<8-9,Chandler>更具个人特色  你可以讲讲我们的小故事
<8-9,Chandler>It can be more personal. You can tell stories about us.

179
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:18,090
<8-12,Monica>好  我可以讲你们当年在伦敦勾搭上了
<8-12,Monica>Okay! Maybe I'll talk about London, when you hooked up.

180
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,750
<8-14,Monica>当然我不会说"勾搭上了"
<8-14,Monica>Only I won't say "hooked up"...

181
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:24,200
<8-17,Joey>我会说  他们美丽的旅程...
<8-17,Joey>...l'll say, "began their beautiful journey...

182
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,760
<8-18,Monica>-这就对了  -一"炮"打响
<8-18,Monica>- There you go. ...by doing it."

183
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,610
<8-20,Chandler>-乔伊  -好吧
<8-20,Chandler>- Joe. - Okay, all right.

184
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:33,920
<8-21,Joey>你们是怎么开始的
<8-21,Joey>So how did it happen?

185
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,840
<8-21,Joey>你们穿越人群  四目相对
<8-21,Joey>Did your eyes meet across the room...

186
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:39,580
<8-21,Joey>然后你们泡在浴缸里  她喂你吃草莓
<8-21,Joey>...then you're in the bathtub and she's feeding you strawberries?

187
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,340
<8-22,Chandler>-那不是你和伴娘的风流往事吗  -对
<8-22,Chandler>- Isn't that what happened to you? - Yeah!

188
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,200
<8-23,Joey>我称其为"伦敦派"
<8-23,Joey>I call that "London style."

189
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,200
<8-24,Monica>我们不是这么开始的
<8-24,Monica>That didn't happen with us.

190
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,020
<8-22,Chandler>你应该顺口承认下来
<8-22,Chandler>Maybe you should say it is,

191
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,810
<8-23,Joey>因为"伦敦派"听着很带劲
<8-23,Joey>because "London style" sounds nice.

192
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,310
<8-23,Joey>好吧
<8-23,Joey>Okay, uh...

193
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,800
<8-24,Monica>那天晚上我很郁闷
<8-24,Monica>I was really sad that night

194
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,890
<8-24,Monica>因为有个家伙以为我是罗斯他妈
<8-24,Monica>because this guy thought I was Ross' mom.

195
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,430
<8-26,Monica>钱德勒对我很体贴  一直安慰我...
<8-26,Monica>And Chandler was really sweet and he consoled me and...

196
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,990
<8-26,Monica>-我们喝得烂醉  -这就对了  宝贝
<8-26,Monica>...we drank too much. - Yeah, baby.

197
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:16,150
<8-28,Chandler>我很绅士地
<8-28,Chandler>I was a perfect gentleman

198
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:19,550
<8-28,Chandler>陪她走回酒店房间  道了晚安
<8-28,Chandler>and I walked her to her hotel room and said good night.

199
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,500
<9-1,Chandler>-但后来...  -这就对了  宝贝
<9-1,Chandler>- But then, later that night... - Yeah, baby.

200
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,230
<9-2,Monica>可爱的睡衣  真想在伦敦过得多采多姿是吧
<9-2,Monica>Cute P.J.s. Really living it up here in London, huh?

201
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:43,660
<9-3,Chandler>我还以为不会有人来了  毕竟现在都...
<9-3,Chandler>Well, I wasn't exactly expecting company after...

202
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,250
<9-3,Chandler>9点15分了
<9-3,Chandler>...9:15.

203
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:48,700
<9-4,Monica>乔伊在吗
<9-4,Monica>Is Joey here?

204
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:52,910
<9-5,Chandler>我之前见他搂着伴娘  抱着一桶草莓
<9-5,Chandler>Last I saw he was with a bridesmaid and a bucket of strawberries.

205
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,540
<9-5,Chandler>那个
<9-5,Chandler>So...

206
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:58,330
<9-5,Chandler>你不会还在为那家伙的话生气吧
<9-5,Chandler>You're not still upset about what that guy told you, are you?

207
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,040
<9-6,Monica>换你不生气吗
<9-6,Monica>Wouldn't you be?

208
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:02,300
<9-7,Chandler>你这段时间情绪很不稳定
<9-7,Chandler>It's been a really emotional time

209
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,640
<9-7,Chandler>又喝了不少
<9-7,Chandler>and you've had a lot to drink...

210
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,810
<9-7,Chandler>你就别再纠结了  好吗
<9-7,Chandler>You have to let that go, okay?

211
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:10,000
<9-7,Chandler>你是今晚宴会上最美的女人
<9-7,Chandler>You were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight.

212
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:12,000
<9-8,Monica>真的吗
<9-8,Monica>Really?

213
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,250
<9-9,Chandler>开玩笑  你是全世界最美的女人
<9-9,Chandler>You kidding? You're the most beautiful woman in most rooms...

214
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,910
<9-9,Chandler>怎么回事
<9-9,Chandler>Whoa, what's going on?

215
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,070
<9-9,Chandler>我们亲嘴了
<9-9,Chandler>You and I just made out!

216
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:28,440
<9-9,Chandler>-我们亲嘴了  -现在没有啊
<9-9,Chandler>- You and I are making out? - Not anymore.

217
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:30,920
<9-11,Chandler>可我们之前没亲过
<9-11,Chandler>But we don't do that.

218
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:32,860
<9-12,Monica>我知道  我觉得亲一亲会很好玩
<9-12,Monica>I know, I thought it would be fun.

219
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,590
<9-13,Chandler>你醉到什么程度
<9-13,Chandler>How drunk are you?

220
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,550
<9-14,Monica>醉到知道自己想亲你
<9-14,Monica>Enough to know I want to do this.

221
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:40,400
<9-14,Monica>但头脑还够清醒  你不必感觉占了我的便宜
<9-14,Monica>Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.

222
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,060
<9-15,Chandler>醉得刚刚好
<9-15,Chandler>That's the perfect amount.

223
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:52,610
<9-18,Chandler>-你知道奇怪在哪儿吗  -哪儿
<9-18,Chandler>- You know what's weird? - What?

224
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:55,110
<9-19,Monica>-感觉一点都不奇怪  -对啊
<9-19,Monica>- This doesn't feel weird. - I know.

225
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,880
<9-21,Monica>你的吻功很棒
<9-21,Monica>You're a really good kisser.

226
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,840
<9-22,Chandler>我吻过不止四个女人
<9-22,Chandler>Well, I have kissed over four women.

227
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:04,290
<9-22,Chandler>-想钻到被窝里吗  -好啊
<9-22,Chandler>- Want to get under the covers? - Okay.

228
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,300
<9-25,Monica>你动作太快了吧
<9-25,Monica>Wow, you are really fast!

229
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:19,220
<9-26,Chandler>你觉得我速度快  这对我来说是好兆头
<9-26,Chandler>It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.

230
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:23,100
<9-27,Monica>-我们要裸程相见了  -对
<9-27,Monica>- We're gonna see each other naked. - Yep.

231
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:26,840
<9-29,Monica>-同时看吧  -数到三
<9-29,Monica>- You want to do it at the same time? - Count of three?

232
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:29,540
<9-31,Monica>一  二  三
<9-31,Monica>One, two, three.

233
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:38,500
<9-34,Monica and Chandler>看来我们的友谊算是彻底毁了
<9-34,Monica and Chandler>Well, I think it's safe to say our friendship is effectively ruined.

234
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,770
<9-36,Monica>反正我们本来也没那么要好
<9-36,Monica>Eh, we weren't that close anyway.

235
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:46,370
<9-38,Chandler>乔伊  乔伊  乔伊...
<9-38,Chandler>Joey, Joey, Joey...!

236
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:53,150

<9-40,Chandler>Hey, Joe. I was just watching a movie...

237
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,280
<9-41,Joey>老兄  对不起
<9-41,Joey>Oh, dude, I'm so sorry.

238
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:01,060
<9-42,Chandler>不是你想的那样
<9-42,Chandler>No! No! No!

239
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:04,580
<9-43,Joey>没事  我还跟伴娘在一起
<9-43,Joey>No, no, no! It's cool, I'm still with my bridesmaid.

240
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,640
<9-43,Joey>安全套在哪儿
<9-43,Joey>Where are the condoms you brought?

241
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:08,920
<9-44,Chandler>在那边  我的包里
<9-44,Chandler>In my bag over there.

242
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:17,320
<9-46,Chandler>可以留一个给我吗
<9-46,Chandler>Could you leave me one?

243
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,640
<9-47,Joey>就你自己用吗
<9-47,Joey>For just you?

244
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:23,730
<9-50,Chandler>对
<9-50,Chandler>Yeah.

245
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:29,440
<9-51,Joey>好吧  给你  老兄
<9-51,Joey>All right. There you go, buddy.

246
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,530
<9-51,Joey>好好快活吧
<9-51,Joey>Go nuts.

247
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,330
<9-52,Joey>原来是怎么回事啊
<9-52,Joey>That's what that was?

248
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:39,180
<9-54,Joey>如果我当时没给你留套会怎样
<9-54,Joey>Can you imagine if I hadn't left you that last one?

249
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,240
<9-54,Joey>你们俩可能就没机会在一起了
<9-54,Joey>You two might've never gotten together.

250
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:45,440
<9-54,Joey>如果我照原来计划招了妓女上去会怎样
<9-54,Joey>Can you imagine if I had sent that hooker like I was gonna?

251
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,320
<9-54,Joey>这就是命运的安排
<9-54,Joey>It's like it was in the stars.

252
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,000
<9-55,Phoebe>是啊  你们注定要在一起
<9-55,Phoebe>Yeah, totally meant to be.

253
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,860
<9-55,Phoebe>告诉他你那晚原先是要去找谁
<9-55,Phoebe>Tell him who you originally wanted to hook up with that night.

254
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,370
<9-56,Monica>-什么  -什么
<9-56,Monica>- What? - What?

255
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,900
<9-58,Phoebe>什么
<9-58,Phoebe>What?

256
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:04,510
<9-59,Chandler>你原先是要去找谁
<9-59,Chandler>Who did you originally want to hook up with?

257
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,330
<9-60,Monica>好吧  不要生气
<9-60,Monica>Okay, fine, but please don't be upset.

258
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:13,000
<9-60,Monica>我当时真的很郁闷  而且烂醉如泥
<9-60,Monica>I was really depressed, okay? And really drunk.

259
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:16,620
<9-60,Monica>我想做点毫无意义的蠢事  只想找个炮友
<9-60,Monica>I wanted something stupid and meaningless. I just wanted sex.

260
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:20,960
<9-60,Monica>所以那晚我到你们房间...
<9-60,Monica>So, when I went to your room that night...

261
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,920
<9-60,Monica>其实是想找乔伊
<9-60,Monica>...I was actually looking for Joey.

262
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,030
<9-60,Monica>这就对了  宝贝
<9-60,Monica>Yeah, baby.

263
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:36,110
<9-61,Joey>不  宝贝
<9-61,Joey>No, baby.

264
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,340
<9-61,Joey>我的天啊
<9-61,Joey>Oh, my God.

265
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:41,300
<10-1,Chandler>你是去找乔伊的
<10-1,Chandler>So you came to the room looking for Joey?

266
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,250
<10-1,Chandler>你有打算告诉我吗
<10-1,Chandler>Were you planning on telling me this?

267
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:46,240
<10-2,Monica>没有  我觉得这不重要
<10-2,Monica>No, I didn't think it was important.

268
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:48,950
<10-3,Chandler>这不重要  这不重要
<10-3,Chandler>It's not important? It's not important?

269
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:51,980
<10-3,Chandler>如果没那个伴娘  你嫁的会是他而不是我
<10-3,Chandler>If it wasn't for a bridesmaid, you'd be marrying him not me.

270
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:55,070
<10-7,Monica>你知道我有多高兴
<10-7,Monica>Do you know how unbelievably glad I am

271
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:57,490
<10-7,Monica>乔伊当时不在吗
<10-7,Monica>that Joey was not there that night?

272
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:02,700
<10-8,Joey>虽然我是神职人员  可是我还是有感觉的
<10-8,Joey>I'm a man of the cloth, but I still have feelings.

273
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,340
<10-9,Chandler>现在你不可能替我们主婚了
<10-9,Chandler>There's no way you're doing this wedding now, okay?

274
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:12,110
<10-10,Joey>什么  这不公平  又不是我的错
<10-10,Joey>What? That's not fair. It's not my fault.

275
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,910
<10-10,Joey>我当时和伴娘在一起
<10-10,Joey>I was off with my bridesmaid.

276
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,200
<10-10,Joey>而且你怎么知道我会答应她
<10-10,Joey>And who's to say I would've said yes?

277
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,280
<10-10,Joey>我肯定会答应的
<10-10,Joey>I mean, I would've said yes.

278
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,770
<10-10,Joey>你把这件事看得太严重了
<10-10,Joey>Chandler, you are making way too big a deal out of this.

279
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:24,600
<10-10,Joey>最后的结局很好啊
<10-10,Joey>Everything worked out okay.

280
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,290
<10-11,Chandler>就是觉得别扭
<10-11,Chandler>It's just weird, okay?

281
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:28,060
<10-11,Chandler>我可不想在立下婚誓的时候
<10-11,Chandler>I don't want to be saying my vows

282
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:30,880
<10-11,Chandler>脑海里浮现你和莫妮卡的在一起的样子
<10-11,Chandler>and then having the mental image of you and Monica.

283
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,050
<10-11,Chandler>我需要...
<10-11,Chandler>I need...

284
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:33,830
<10-11,Chandler>我也不知道我要什么  我出去透透气
<10-11,Chandler>I don't know what I need. I need a walk.

285
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:35,850
<10-12,Monica>等一下  钱德勒  这没什么大不了
<10-12,Monica>Wait, Chandler, come on, it's not a big deal.

286
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:38,870
<10-13,Chandler>对我很重要  你本想和蝙蝠侠上床
<10-13,Chandler>It is to me. You wanted to sleep with Batman,

287
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:41,360
<10-13,Chandler>结果用罗宾打发了
<10-13,Chandler>and instead you had to settle for Robin.

288
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:48,600
<10-13,Chandler>-这太扯了  -不  罗宾绝对是同性恋
<10-13,Chandler>- This is crazy. - No, Robin is so gay.

289
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:55,780
<11-1,Rachel>-我们都说好了  -不再搞恶作剧了
<11-1,Rachel>- So now what have we agreed? - No more pranks.

290
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:59,600
<11-4,Ben>-还有呢  -你和爸爸当时没分开
<11-4,Ben>- What else? - You and Daddy were not on a break.

291
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,220
<11-5,Rachel>很好
<11-5,Rachel>Very good.

292
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:07,600
<11-6,Ross>瑞秋  你怎么来了
<11-6,Ross>Rachel, what are you doing here?

293
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:10,990
<11-7,Rachel>来看我好朋友卡罗尔
<11-7,Rachel>I'm just visiting my good friend Carol.

294
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:13,680
<11-8,Ross>-你的好朋友  -对
<11-8,Ross>- Your good friend? - Yeah.

295
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,570
<11-10,Ross>她姓什么
<11-10,Ross>What's her last name?

296
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,420
<11-11,Rachel>卡罗尔...
<11-11,Rachel>Carol...

297
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,840
<11-11,Rachel>-同性恋  -很好
<11-11,Rachel>- Lesbian. - Nice.

298
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:28,190
<11-12,Ross>还有  我脸上那条线
<11-12,Ross>By the way, that line down my face...

299
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:30,850
<11-13,Rachel>今天最后一堂课...
<11-13,Rachel>The line that prompted a student...

300
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:33,980
<11-14,Ross>一个学生对我说
<11-14,Ross>...in my last class of the day to say:

301
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,560
<11-14,Ross>"老兄  你从来不洗脸吗"
<11-14,Ross>"Dude, don't you ever wash your face?"

302
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,730
<11-15,Rachel>好吧  我很抱歉没有告诉你
<11-15,Rachel>All right I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

303
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:44,510
<11-20,Ross>我不准你再教我儿子那些东西了
<11-20,Ross>Listen, I don't want you teaching my son that stuff anymore.

304
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,410
<11-25,Carol>-好吗  -好  好
<11-25,Carol>- Okay? - Fine. Fine.

305
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:48,340
<11-30,Rachel>我一教他那些恶作剧
<11-30,Rachel>But I'll have you know that once I taught him that stuff,

306
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,250
<11-30,Rachel>他叫我"搞笑的瑞秋阿姨"
<11-30,Rachel>he called me "fun Aunt Rachel."

307
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,630
<11-30,Rachel>我喜欢做搞笑的瑞秋阿姨
<11-30,Rachel>And I loved being fun Aunt Rachel.

308
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:57,110
<11-31,Ross>我很高兴你们能玩得来  但...
<11-31,Ross>I'm glad you guys were bonding but...

309
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:59,530
<11-32,Rachel>他没有任何兄弟姐妹
<11-32,Rachel>Look, he doesn't have any brothers or sisters.

310
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:01,870
<11-32,Rachel>得有人教他这些东西
<11-32,Rachel>Somebody has to teach him this stuff.

311
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:05,990
<11-32,Rachel>我没有教他任何正常六岁小孩不该知道的事
<11-32,Rachel>I haven't taught him anything a normal 6-year-old doesn't know anyway.

312
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,430
<11-34,Rachel>-可恶  -我要走了
<11-34,Rachel>- Crap! - I gotta go.

313
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,340
<12-2,Chandler>你想要这个酥饼吗
<12-2,Chandler>You want this scone?

314
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:20,530
<12-2,Chandler>这是给我的  但它更想和你睡
<12-2,Chandler>It came for me but it would rather sleep with you.

315
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:24,600
<12-3,Joey>别这样  明明什么都没发生
<12-3,Joey>Come on. Nothing even happened.

316
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,120
<12-5,Joey>我只是不想惹你生气
<12-5,Joey>I just don't want you to be upset.

317
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,630
<12-6,Chandler>我怎么能不生气
<12-6,Chandler>How can I not be upset?

318
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:33,400
<12-6,Chandler>我终于和一位如此难得的女人坠入爱河...
<12-6,Chandler>I finally fall in love with this fantastic woman...

319
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,810
<12-6,Chandler>可她最初想要的却是你
<12-6,Chandler>...and it turns out she wanted you first.

320
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:38,680
<12-7,Joey>只是某晚的那半小时而已
<12-7,Joey>Yeah, for like a half an hour one night.

321
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:42,700
<12-7,Joey>钱德勒  她想和你共度一生
<12-7,Joey>Chandler, she wants you for the rest of her life.

322
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,750
<12-7,Joey>我们看着你们  相知相爱在一起
<12-7,Joey>We look at you and we see you together,

323
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,270
<12-7,Joey>就是...
<12-7,Joey>and it just...

324
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:50,310
<12-7,Joey>很般配  你知道吗
<12-7,Joey>...it fits, you know?

325
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:55,070
<12-7,Joey>我们知道你们一定会相伴到老
<12-7,Joey>And you just know it's gonna last forever.

326
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,410
<12-8,Chandler>你就该说这些话才对
<12-8,Chandler>That's what you should say.

327
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:02,370
<12-9,Joey>什么
<12-9,Joey>What?

328
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:07,690
<12-10,Chandler>你给我们主婚的时候  就该说这段话
<12-10,Chandler>When you're marrying us, that's what you should say.

329
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,090
<12-11,Joey>真的  我可以替你们主婚吗
<12-11,Joey>Really? I could do it?

330
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,110
<12-12,Chandler>我很希望你替我们主婚
<12-12,Chandler>I'd love you to do it.

331
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:22,960
<12-14,Chandler>不过你到时就要说那段话  一字不差
<12-14,Chandler>But those are the words. Those exact words.

332
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,470
<12-15,Joey>我记不太清了  不过...
<12-15,Joey>Well, I don't remember exactly but...

333
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:30,850
<12-15,Joey>基本上是关于拥有与付出
<12-15,Joey>...it's pretty much about having and giving

334
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:33,140
<12-15,Joey>分享与接受
<12-15,Joey>and sharing and receiving.

<12-15,Joey>We talked and Monica made me see that I overreacted a little bit.

337
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,910
<12-15,Joey>生命中有些事情更加重要
<12-15,Joey>Some things in life are more important.

00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:51,610
<12-15,Joey>这就对了  宝贝

340
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:01,130
<12-15,Joey>如果你们两个在一起会是什么样子
<12-15,Joey>...what would've happened if you two had hooked up.
