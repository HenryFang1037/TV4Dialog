00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,740
<12-10,Monica>乔伊  那不是前几天跟你挥手的女孩吗
<12-10,Monica>Hey Joey! Isn't that the girl that waved at you the other day?

251
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:50,040
<12-11,Joey>不知道  但你的床单是透明的
<12-11,Joey>I don't know. But I can see through your sheet.

252
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:55,180
<12-11,Joey>对  是她没错
<12-11,Joey>Yeah, yeah, that's her.

253
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:56,360
<12-11,Joey>不过算了吧
<12-11,Joey>But y'know what? Doesn't matter,

254
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:57,850
<12-11,Joey>我无缘跟她见面
<12-11,Joey>I'm never gonna get to meet her anyway.

255
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:58,660
<12-12,Monica>为什么
<12-12,Monica>Why?

256
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:00,520
<12-13,Joey>因为我找不到她的公寓
<12-13,Joey>Because it's impossible to find her apartment!

257
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:03,920
<12-13,Joey>她就像是住在辣妹平行空间里
<12-13,Joey>She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something.

258
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:07,240
<12-13,Joey>你在说什么
<12-13,Joey>What are you talking about?

259
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:09,700
<12-14,Monica>她明明就住在二楼
<12-14,Monica>She obviously lives on the second floor,

260
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:10,920
<12-14,Monica>左边数过来第七间
<12-14,Monica>seventh apartment from the left!

261
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,030
<12-15,Joey>不对
<12-15,Joey>No. No. No.

262
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,960
<12-15,Joey>她住在三楼左边数过来第八间
<12-15,Joey>She lives on the third floor, eighth apartment from the left.

263
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:18,270
<12-16,Monica>才怪  前两个窗户是大厅的
<12-16,Monica>No, those first two windows,  that's the lobby.

264
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,920
<12-16,Monica>过去那边的是楼梯间窗户
<12-16,Monica>And y'know the other one over there, that's the stairway.

265
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:22,180
<12-16,Monica>你数错了
<12-16,Monica>You've been counting wrong.

266
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:25,060
<12-17,Joey>我之前不知道  莫妮卡  多谢
<12-17,Joey>I did not know that! Thank you Monica.

267
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:28,280
<12-17,Joey>不敢相信我因为数数  差点又失去了一个女孩
<12-17,Joey>I can't believe I almost lost another girl because of counting.

268
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:32,520
<13-1,Ross>你好了吗
<13-1,Ross>So uhh, you ready?

269
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:34,450
<13-2,Jen>-好了  我去拿外套  －好
<13-2,Jen>- Sure, I'll just get my coat. - Okay.

270
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,690
<13-2,Jen>你能帮我应门吗
<13-2,Jen>Could you get that?

271
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:37,590
<13-3,Ross>没问题
<13-3,Ross>Sure.

272
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:46,830
<13-3,Ross>乔伊
<13-3,Ross>Joey...

273
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,200
<13-4,Joey>不  不
<13-4,Joey>No! Noooo!!

274
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:57,570
<13-4,Joey>首先我要谢谢你
<13-4,Joey>Ah, first, I-I would like to say thank you

275
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,600
<14-1,Rachel>同意再次见我
<14-1,Rachel>for agreeing to see me again.

276
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:02,860
<14-2,Mr. Zelner>不要紧  但我有义务告诉你
<14-2,Mr. Zelner>That's quite all right, but I feel obligated to tell you

277
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:05,160
<14-2,Mr. Zelner>这次的面试有录影存证
<14-2,Mr. Zelner>that this meeting is being videotaped.

278
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:14,210
<14-3,Rachel>好  首先我要向你道歉
<14-3,Rachel>Okay. Umm, well, first I would like to start by apologizing

279
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:18,130
<14-3,Rachel>我亲了你  还对你大吼
<14-3,Rachel>for kissing you and uh, for yelling at you.

280
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,430
<14-4,Mr. Zelner>好的
<14-4,Mr. Zelner>Fair enough.

281
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:23,180
<14-5,Rachel>你或许会想雇用
<14-5,Rachel>Now you're probably going to hire one of the people

282
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:26,120
<14-2,Mr. Zelner>不曾  不曾...
<14-2,Mr. Zelner>who did not ah,  who did, who did not umm,

283
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:29,140
<14-3,Rachel>对你大吼然后夺门而出的人
<14-3,Rachel>yell at you and storm out,

284
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:32,610
<14-4,Mr. Zelner>不过那样可就错大了  原因是这样的
<14-4,Mr. Zelner>and I think that's a big mistake and here's why.

285
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:36,140
<14-5,Rachel>我大出洋相之后还敢回来
<14-5,Rachel>I made a huge fool of myself and I came back,

286
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:38,020
<14-5,Rachel>这显示我有勇气
<14-5,Rachel>that shows courage.

287
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:41,130
<14-5,Rachel>我以为你要我用性爱来交换工作时
<14-5,Rachel>When I thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job,

288
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:41,850
<14-5,Rachel>我拒绝了
<14-5,Rachel>I said no.

289
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,650
<14-5,Rachel>这表示我有骨气
<14-5,Rachel>That shows integrity.

290
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:47,080
<14-5,Rachel>我不害怕挺身为自己辩护
<14-5,Rachel>And, I was not afraid to stand up for myself

291
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,890
<14-5,Rachel>这表示我有勇气
<14-5,Rachel>and that shows courage.

292
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:54,230
<14-5,Rachel>我知道我已经说过勇气了
<14-5,Rachel>Okay umm, now I know I already said courage,

293
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,800
<14-5,Rachel>不过勇气总是多多益善嘛
<14-5,Rachel>but y'know you gotta have courage.

294
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:01,830
<14-5,Rachel>最后当我以为你想趁工作之便
<14-5,Rachel>And umm, and finally when I thought you were making

295
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:03,840
<14-5,Rachel>占我便宜时
<14-5,Rachel>sexual advances in the workplace,

296
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:06,520
<14-5,Rachel>我拒绝了  但是没打算告你
<14-5,Rachel>I said no and I was not litigious.

297
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:09,990
<14-5,Rachel>所以你看  我有勇气  有骨气
<14-5,Rachel>So there you go, you got, you got  courage, you got integrity,

298
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:14,660
<14-5,Rachel>双重勇气  而且又不告你
<14-5,Rachel>you got courage again, and not litigious.

299
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,980
<14-5,Rachel>听我说
<14-5,Rachel>Look Mr...

305
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:36,900
<14-7,Rachel>你知道吗
<14-7,Rachel>Y'know what?

306

<15-5,Chandler>Now I gotta go, Officer Bing has gotta, 10-100.

<15-6,Monica>菲比  你头发里有树枝

328
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:56,190
<15-7,Phoebe>来这里的路上我们绕了一点路
<15-7,Phoebe>Ohh,  umm, we kinda took a little detour on the way over here.

00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:58,360
<15-8,Gary>对  我们去公园里散步
<15-8,Gary>Yeah, we took a little stroll in the park

330
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:00,090
<15-8,Gary>看四下无人就...
<15-8,Gary>and no one was around, so...

331
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:01,890
<15-9,Monica>不会吧
<15-9,Monica>You didn't!

332
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,070
<15-10,Phoebe>我们做了
<15-10,Phoebe>We did!

333
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:07,020
<15-10,Phoebe>我们违反了刑法第12条第7节
<15-10,Phoebe>We violated Section 12 Paragraph 7 of the criminal code!

334
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:12,200
<15-11,Monica>在公园是吧
<15-11,Monica>The park huh?

335
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:14,990
<15-11,Monica>公共场所
<15-11,Monica>A public place.

336
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,970
<15-13,Monica>收到  失陪一下
<15-13,Monica>I hear ya. Excuse me for just a second!

337
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:29,890
<16-1,Monica>钱德勒
<16-1,Monica>Hi Chandler.

338
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:32,570
<16-2,Chandler>莫妮卡  这是男厕
<16-2,Chandler>Monica! This is the Men's room!

339
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:34,970
<16-2,Chandler>没错吧
<16-2,Chandler>Isn't it?

340
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:38,890
<16-3,Monica>没错
<16-3,Monica>Yes it is.

341
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:42,830
<16-3,Monica>我一直都觉得男厕很性感
<16-3,Monica>You see I've always found the men's bathroom very sexual.

342
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,140
<16-3,Monica>你不觉得吗
<16-3,Monica>Haven't you?

343
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:48,720
<16-4,Chandler>不觉得  否则我们就不会在一起了
<16-4,Chandler>No. And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out.

344
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:51,370
<16-4,Chandler>拜托  这越来越离谱了
<16-4,Chandler>Come on, this is getting ridiculous!

345
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:53,440
<16-5,Monica>别这样  我们不能让他们赢
<16-5,Monica>Come on, we can't let them win!

346
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:56,490
<16-6,Chandler>我们已经证明我们在热恋了
<16-6,Chandler>Ugh, we have already proved that we are hot! Okay?

347
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:59,030
<16-6,Chandler>为何你走火入魔成这样
<16-6,Chandler>So why-why are you getting so obsessed about this thing?!

348
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,050
<16-7,Monica>因为菲比和盖瑞正处在
<16-7,Monica>Because Phoebe and Gary are in that

349
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,820
<16-7,Monica>"难分难舍在公园里做那档事"的阶段
<16-7,Monica>-can't-keep-their-hands-off-each-other-doing-it-in-the-park phase!

350
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:04,700
<16-8,Chandler>所以呢
<16-8,Chandler>So?

351
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:09,200
<16-9,Monica>所以我很伤心  我们不在那个阶段了
<16-9,Monica>So, I feel really sad that we're not...really there anymore.

352
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:13,160
<16-10,Chandler>原来是为了这个
<16-10,Chandler>Oh wow! Is that what this all have been about?

353
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:17,440
<16-11,Monica>我们成天腻在一起时
<16-11,Monica>Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were y'know

354
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:19,860
<16-11,Monica>不是更让人激动吗
<16-11,Monica>all over each other all the time?

355
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:23,770
<16-12,Chandler>那时是很棒  真的很棒
<16-12,Chandler>Yeah that was great. That was really great!

356
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:24,810
<16-12,Chandler>但是老实跟你说
<16-12,Chandler>But to tell you the truth,

357
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:27,300
<16-12,Chandler>我们现在的状况更让我激动
<16-12,Chandler>I'm more excited about where we are right now.

358
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:28,820
<16-13,Monica>真的
<16-13,Monica>Really?

359
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:29,790
<16-13,Monica>是啊
<16-13,Monica>Yeah!

360
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,040
<16-14,Chandler>我从没谈过这么久的恋爱
<16-14,Chandler>I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before.

361
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:34,600
<16-14,Chandler>过了刚开始的激情期
<16-14,Chandler>Y'know to get past the beginning

362
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,920
<16-14,Chandler>还一直跟对方在一起
<16-14,Chandler>and still be around each other all the time,

363
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:38,770
<16-14,Chandler>我觉得太不可思议了
