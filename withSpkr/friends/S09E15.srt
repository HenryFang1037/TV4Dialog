<5-25,Joey>"阿拉可以现在奏肘  劳哥儿"  怎样
<5-25,Joey>''I could go right now, mon!'' Huh?

137
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,410
<5-26,Lennart>我的老天爷啊
<5-26,Lennart>My God in heaven.

138
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,570
<5-26,Lennart>乔伊  你等一下
<5-26,Lennart>Joey, hang on.

139
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:20,270
<5-27,Lennart>李奥  我们可以谈一谈吗
<5-27,Lennart>Leonard, can we talk to you for a moment?

140
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:24,660
<5-27,Lennart>怎样  你是在开玩笑吧
<5-27,Lennart>Yes? You've got to be kidding.

141
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:26,720
<5-27,Lennart>他根本不会演戏
<5-27,Lennart>He can't act.

142
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:29,070
<5-28,Lennart>我不在乎你是不是觉得他很帅
<5-28,Lennart>I don't care if you think he's hot.

143
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,630
<5-28,Lennart>如果你想要跟他上床  随你便
<5-28,Lennart>lf you want to sleep with him, do it on your own time.

144
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,000
<5-28,Lennart>但这是一场戏剧表演
<5-28,Lennart>This is a play.

145
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,470
<5-28,Lennart>如果你坚持这样...
<5-28,Lennart>If you insist on this...

146
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,680
<5-28,Lennart>我会用手机快捷的通知我经纪人
<5-28,Lennart>I will call my agent so fast

147
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:42,320
<5-28,Lennart>话质清晰到  让他以为我就在隔壁
<5-28,Lennart>on a cell phone connection so clear, he's gonna think I'm next door!

148
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:47,950
<5-28,Lennart>谢谢你  这么小声帮我说话
<5-28,Lennart>Hi, thank you so much for whispering for my benefit.

149
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:51,770
<5-29,Joey>请告诉我  我是哪里不好
<5-29,Joey>Tell me what I did wrong. I'd love to work on it

150
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,720
<5-29,Joey>我会改进  再表演一次给你看
<5-29,Joey>and try it again for you.

151
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:55,940
<5-29,Joey>还有  你好吗
<5-29,Joey>And also, how you doing?

<5-29,Joey>再给我一次机会
<5-29,Joey>Give me another chance.

153
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,350
<5-30,Lennart>我真的想要进步  拜托
<5-30,Lennart>I really want to get better. Please?

154
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,650
<5-30,Lennart>你傍晚如果再来
<5-30,Lennart>If you want to come back the end of today.

155
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,550
<5-30,Lennart>这是我的建议
<5-30,Lennart>here are my notes.

156
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,310
<5-31,Joey>-准备好了吗   -好了
<5-31,Joey>- Ready?  - Yeah.

157
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:11,410
<5-32,Lennart>你太用脑子
<5-32,Lennart>You're in your head.

158
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:12,730
<5-32,Lennart>想的太多了
<5-32,Lennart>You're thinking way too much.

159
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:13,870
<5-33,Joey>我真的很怀疑
<5-33,Joey>I really doubt that.

160
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:19,520
<5-34,Lennart>不是  你并没有跟你的身体联系起来
<5-34,Lennart>No, no. It's that you're not connected with anything in your body.

161
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:20,610
<5-34,Lennart>没表达出迫切感
<5-34,Lennart>There's no urgency.

162
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,800
<5-34,Lennart>这一幕是很纠结的
<5-34,Lennart>The scene is a struggle.

163
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:23,760
<5-34,Lennart>是一种竞赛  还有
<5-34,Lennart>It's a race. Also,

164
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,630
<5-34,Lennart>你的表演是水平的
<5-34,Lennart>what you did was horizontal.

165
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,400
<5-34,Lennart>别害怕发掘垂直的情感
<5-34,Lennart>Don't be afraid to explore the vertical.

166
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,920
<5-34,Lennart>而且不要体会那些文字
<5-34,Lennart>And don't learn the words.

167
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,000
<5-34,Lennart>让文字体会你
<5-34,Lennart>Let the words learn you.

168
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,650
<5-35,Joey>我不能跟制作人睡一睡就好了吗
<5-35,Joey>Couldn't I just sleep with the producer?

169
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,490
<6-1,Phoebe>要不要一起去吃晚餐
<6-1,Phoebe>Hey, do you want to go to dinner tonight?

170
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:50,750
<6-2,Ross>不行  我要跟女服务生约会  叫凯蒂
<6-2,Ross>l can't. l've got a date with that waitress, Katie.

171
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,260
<6-2,Ross>虽然我们只出去过两次  但我好像...
<6-2,Ross>l know we've only gone out, like, twice, but l don't know...

172
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:56,230
<6-2,Ross>对她的印象很不错
<6-2,Ross>l have a good feeling about her.

173
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,970
<6-3,Phoebe>我听到离婚的钟声了
<6-3,Phoebe>Oh, l hear divorce bells.

174
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:02,230
<6-4,Mugger>钱包交出来  不然你们的麻烦就大了
<6-4,Mugger>Give me your wallets, and there won't be a problem.

175
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,080
<6-5,Ross>什么

176
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:04,100
<6-6,Mugger>我有枪
<6-6,Mugger>l have a gun.

177
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:07,150
<6-7,Ross>好的  不要怕  菲比  保持冷静
<6-7,Ross>Okay, relax, Phoebe. Just stay calm.

178
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,280
<6-7,Ross>我的天呐  找不到我的钱包了
<6-7,Ross>Oh, my God, l can't find my wallet!

179
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,650
<6-8,Mugger>好了  女士  把你的包给我了
<6-8,Mugger>All right, lady, now give me your purse.

180
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,350
<6-9,Phoebe>不给
<6-9,Phoebe>No.

181
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,420
<6-10,Ross>你说不给是什么意思
<6-10,Ross>What do you mean ''no''?

182
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:20,530
<6-10,Ross>我就知道你会害死我的  菲比·布菲
<6-10,Ross>l knew you'd be my death, Phoebe Buffay!

183
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,420
<6-11,Phoebe>罗威  是你吗
<6-11,Phoebe>Lowell, is that you?

197

<6-20,Lowell>l guess your mugging days are behind you.

<6-22,Ross>我的天  菲比  你以前抢劫
<6-22,Ross>Oh, my God. Phoebe, you used to mug people?

<6-23,Phoebe>Excuse me, Ross, old friends catching up.

200
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:09,100
<7-1,Monica>试演怎么样
<7-1,Monica>How'd the audition go?

201
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:11,730
<7-2,Joey>他们要我再去  但是…
<7-2,Joey>They want to see me again, but...

202
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,970
<7-2,Joey>李奥·海斯不喜欢我
<7-2,Joey>...Leonard Hayes did not like me.

203
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:15,620
<7-3,Monica>怎么了
<7-3,Monica>What happened?

204
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:18,010
<7-4,Joey>他说我迫切感不够
<7-4,Joey>He said l wasn't urgent enough.

205
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:21,100
<7-4,Joey>我演的是水平的
<7-4,Joey>Everything l did was horizontal,

206
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,950
<7-4,Joey>应该要垂直一点
<7-4,Joey>and l should be more vertical.

207
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,040
<7-4,Joey>他说我应该不要想太多
<7-4,Joey>He said that l should think less.

208
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:28,550
<7-5,Monica>目前为止你做的不错
<7-5,Monica>Well, so far so good.

210
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:32,100
<7-6,Chandler>亲爱的  我老了
<7-6,Chandler>Honey, l'm old!

211
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,150
<7-7,Monica>怎么了
<7-7,Monica>What's wrong?

212
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:37,890
<7-8,Chandler>跟其他的实习生比  我太老了
<7-8,Chandler>I am so much older than these other interns.

213
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:40,130
<7-8,Chandler>拿什么和他们争
<7-8,Chandler>I can't compete with them.

214
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:42,060
<7-9,Monica>你是年纪比较大一点没错
<7-9,Monica>So you're a little older.

215
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:45,010
<7-9,Monica>往好处想  你有更多的生活经历
<7-9,Monica>Look at the positive. You have all this life experience.

216
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,900
<7-10,Chandler>是的  但生活经历
<7-10,Chandler>Yes, but I don't think life experience

217
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:49,920
<7-10,Chandler>帮不了我  这个
<7-10,Chandler>is gonna help me with these.

218
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:55,900
<7-11,Joey>它们就像着火了
<7-11,Joey>Wow! It's like they're on fire!

219
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,340
<7-12,Monica>这是什么
<7-12,Monica>What are they?

220
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,940
<7-13,Chandler>样品鞋
<7-13,Chandler>Prototype sneakers.

221
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:06,870
<7-13,Chandler>要我想出销售策略  我想不出来
<7-13,Chandler>I need ideas on how to sell them. Which I can't do...

222
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,320
<7-13,Chandler>因为但凡有自尊的成年人
<7-13,Chandler>...because no self-respecting adult

223
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:09,360
<7-13,Chandler>都不会穿这种东西的
<7-13,Chandler>would ever wear these.

224
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:11,220
<7-14,Joey>我给你五百块  这鞋我买了
<7-14,Joey>I'll give you $500 for them.

225
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:16,520
<7-15,Chandler>我应该怎么办呢
<7-15,Chandler>What am I supposed to do?

226
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:18,280
<7-16,Monica>别这样  运动鞋很容易啦
<7-16,Monica>Come on, sneakers are easy.

227
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:19,780
<7-16,Monica>你也总穿啊
<7-16,Monica>You wear them all the time.

228
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:22,040
<7-17,Chandler>首先  它们现在不叫运动鞋了
<7-17,Chandler>They're not called sneakers anymore.

229
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:25,350
<7-17,Chandler>改叫"霹雳鞋"或是"滑轮鞋"
<7-17,Chandler>They're called ''kicks'' or ''skids.''

230
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:27,800
<7-17,Chandler>我还听到有人说"轮鞋"
<7-17,Chandler>I think I heard somebody say ''slorps.''

231
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,430
<7-17,Chandler>鞋的底部有凸出的轮子
<7-17,Chandler>They've got wheels that pop out from the bottom

232
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:33,460
<7-17,Chandler>让你可以滑来滑去
<7-17,Chandler>so you can roll around...

233
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:36,260
<7-17,Chandler>因为显然  走路太耗费体力了
<7-17,Chandler>because apparently walking is too much exercise.

234
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,270
<7-17,Chandler>"孩子们  孩子们
<7-17,Chandler>''Kids! Kids!

235
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:41,000
<7-17,Chandler>一路滑进儿童肥胖区吧  "
<7-17,Chandler>Roll your way to childhood obesity!''

236
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,420
<7-17,Chandler>你可以帮我卖这些东西吗
<7-17,Chandler>Would you help me try to sell these?

237
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:50,510
<7-18,Monica>好的  有没有想过用大波霸呢
<7-18,Monica>Okay. Have you considered using a girl with huge knockers?

238
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,600
<7-19,Chandler>那不会是他们想要的
<7-19,Chandler>That's not what they're looking for.

239
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:55,220
<7-20,Joey>那对我很有用哦
<7-20,Joey>Hey, that would work on me.

240
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:58,120
<7-20,Joey>你想我为什么要买婷美呢
<7-20,Joey>Why do you think I buy Mrs. Butterworth's?

241
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,540
<8-2,Ross>你都猜不到刚才怎么了
<8-2,Ross>You'll never guess what just happened.

242
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:14,050
<8-2,Ross>-我和菲比被打劫了  -你们没事吧
<8-2,Ross>- Phoebe and I got mugged!  - Are you okay?

243
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,280
<8-4,Ross>没事  因为菲比认识那个劫匪
<8-4,Ross>Yeah. Phoebe knew the mugger.

244
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,420
<8-5,Monica>你怎么会认识劫匪呢
<8-5,Monica>How do you know a mugger?

245
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,900
<8-6,Phoebe>不好意思  除了我们六个人之外
<8-6,Phoebe>I'm sorry, I have friends

246
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,560
<8-6,Phoebe>我还有其他朋友
<8-6,Phoebe>outside the six of us.

247
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,430
<8-7,Ross>你知道他们是怎么认识的吗
<8-7,Ross>Know how she knew him?

248
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,030
<8-7,Ross>因为菲比以前也是劫匪
<8-7,Ross>Because Phoebe used to mug people.

249
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:28,350
<8-8,Monica>真的吗
<8-8,Monica>Seriously?

250
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,830
<8-9,Phoebe>我不觉得这是什么光彩事
<8-9,Phoebe>Well, I'm not proud of it,

251
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:32,460
<8-9,Phoebe>但是你们知道的
<8-9,Phoebe>but, you know...

252
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:35,500
<8-9,Phoebe>当我流落街头的时候
<8-9,Phoebe>...when I was living on the street

253
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:38,050
<8-9,Phoebe>也需要钱买食物什么的
<8-9,Phoebe>and I needed money for food and stuff....

254
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,650
<8-10,Monica>菲比  这真是太恐怖了
<8-10,Monica>Phoebe, that is awful.

255
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,510
<8-11,Phoebe>我不像你们那么有钱  好吗
<8-11,Phoebe>I wasn't rich like you guys, okay?

256
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,950
<8-11,Phoebe>我没有金汤匙也没有飞天马
<8-11,Phoebe>I didn't eat gold and have a flying pony.

257
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,300
<8-11,Phoebe>我生活得很艰苦
<8-11,Phoebe>I had a hard life.

258
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:50,930
<8-11,Phoebe>我妈被毒贩子给杀了
<8-11,Phoebe>My mother was killed by a drug dealer.

259
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,260
<8-12,Monica>你妈是自杀的
<8-12,Monica>Your mother killed herself.

260
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:54,110
<8-13,Phoebe>她自己就是毒贩子
<8-13,Phoebe>She was a drug dealer.

261
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,930
<8-14,Ross>幸好他和菲比认识
<8-14,Ross>Anyway, it was a good thing she knew him.

262
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,640
<8-14,Ross>否则我会让他死得很难看
<8-14,Ross>I was about to do some serious damage.

263
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:02,890
<8-15,Phoebe>好吧
<8-15,Phoebe>Okay.

264
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:07,850
<8-16,Monica>一定勾起你的痛苦回忆了  罗斯
<8-16,Monica>This must have brought back some bad memories for you, Ross.

265
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:10,900
<8-18,Monica>-为什么  -罗斯小时候被抢过
<8-18,Monica>- Why?  - Ross was mugged as a kid.

267
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,060
<8-20,Ross>弱小的心灵受到了严重的打击
<8-20,Ross>And it was pretty traumatic.

268
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:16,590
<8-20,Ross>就在圣马克漫画店外面
<8-20,Ross>It was outside St. Mark's Comics.

269
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:18,980
<8-20,Ross>我正在忙着
<8-20,Ross>I was minding my business,

270
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,870
<8-20,Ross>看蜘蛛侠又惹上什么麻烦了
<8-20,Ross>seeing what kind of trouble Spider-Man was into.

271
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,470
<8-20,Ross>是神奇女侠
<8-20,Ross>Wonder Woman.

272
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,300

<8-22,Ross>帮某人买几十个甜蛋糕
<8-22,Ross>to pick up a couple of dozen linzer tortes for someone...

274
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:36,560
<8-22,Ross>然后不知道从哪里冒出来的恶棍
<8-22,Ross>when out of nowhere, this thug with a pipe jumps out

275
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:37,660
<8-22,Ross>拿着一根管子跳出来说...
<8-22,Ross>and says:

276
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:39,120
<8-23,Phoebe>"把钱给我  笨蛋"
<8-23,Phoebe>''Give me your money, punk!''

278
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:41,620
<8-24,Ross>我知道  最糟糕的是
<8-24,Ross>I know. And the worst part was,

00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,050
<8-24,Ross>他们抢走了我的背包
<8-24,Ross>they took my backpack...

322
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:46,000
<10-19,Lennart>加入到这个角色中  简直出乎意料
<10-19,Lennart>you bring to the character I couldn't have imagined.

323
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:47,670
<10-19,Lennart>我们接下来可以这样
<10-19,Lennart>Here's what we're gonna do:

<10-20,Joey>当然  我没时间说谢了
<10-20,Joey>Sure. I don't have time to say thank you

328
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:58,530
<10-20,Joey>真的得走了
<10-20,Joey>because I really gotta go!

329
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:05,220
<10-21,Lennart>瞧瞧他  还那么入戏  我喜欢他
<10-21,Lennart>Look at that! Still in character. I like him.

330
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:08,510
<10-21,Lennart>我播了种  无法言喻
<10-21,Lennart>I plant seeds. I can't explain it. I don't know.

331
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:16,250
<11-3,Monica>你在做什么
<11-3,Monica>Hey. What are you doing?

332
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,310
<11-4,Chandler>在试穿跑鞋
<11-4,Chandler>Putting on the sneakers...

333
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,770
<11-4,Chandler>融入年轻人的世界
<11-4,Chandler>to get in the young mindset,

334
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,320
<11-4,Chandler>看会不会激发出什么灵感
<11-4,Chandler>see if it sparks anything.

335
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:22,930
<11-5,Rachel>-发出什么了  -你听这个
<11-5,Rachel>- Oh, anything yet?  - Yes, how's this?

336
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,550
<11-6,Chandler>"此鞋让你的脚
<11-6,Chandler>''They're so uncomfortable,

337
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,030
<11-6,Chandler>不舒服到像是被踢蛋蛋"
<11-6,Chandler>it's like getting kicked in the nuts for your feet.''

338
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:43,580
<12-3,Joey>你们可能很纳闷我在做什么
<12-3,Joey>You're probably wondering what I'm doing.

339
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:46,180
<12-4,Monica>不  看起来很正常
<12-4,Monica>No, that seems about right.

340
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:49,810
<12-5,Joey>昨天试演的时候我尿急
<12-5,Joey>Yesterday at my audition, I really had to pee.

341
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:52,210
<12-5,Joey>很明显  夹着尿让我演技爆发了
<12-5,Joey>Apparently, having to pee makes me a good actor.

342
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:52,970
<12-5,Joey>可以参加最后试演
<12-5,Joey>I got a callback,

343
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:55,360
<12-5,Joey>所以能喝的我都喝了  对了
<12-5,Joey>so I'm drinking everything. Oh, by the way...

344
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:57,950
<12-5,Joey>我们冰箱里面的蛋奶实在太好喝了
<12-5,Joey>that eggnog in our fridge was great!

345
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,600
<12-6,Rachel>乔伊  那是婴儿食品
<12-6,Rachel>Joey, that was formula.

00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,180
<12-7,Joey>我们一定要多买一些
<12-7,Joey>We gotta get more of that.

347
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:06,090
<12-8,Chandler>这东西还不赖
<12-8,Chandler>These aren't half bad.

348
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:08,900
<12-8,Chandler>你应该要向拉夫·劳伦推荐
<12-8,Chandler>You should suggest these to Ralph Lauren.

349
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,560
<12-9,Rachel>第一  那很蠢
<12-9,Rachel>Okay, first of all, that's stupid.

350
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:13,280
<12-9,Rachel>第二  他们不允许我跟拉夫说话
<12-9,Rachel>Second, I'm not allowed to talk to Ralph.

351
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,840
<12-10,Chandler>好的  我已经觉得年轻多了
<12-10,Chandler>All right. I feel younger already.

<13-4,Ross>从来没人问过我的课  出什么事了
<13-4,Ross>No one asks me that. What's wrong?

357
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:37,110
<13-5,Phoebe>-没事  就是很想知道而已  -哦
<13-5,Phoebe>- Nothing. I really want to know.  - Oh.

358
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:40,970
<13-6,Ross>我们针对更新世
<13-6,Ross>Well, there was actually a rather lively discussion

359
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,320
<13-6,Ross>讨论得相当热烈
<13-6,Ross>about the Pleistocene--

360
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:43,990
<13-7,Phoebe>好了  我不需要这样折磨自己
<13-7,Phoebe>All right, nothing is worth this.

361
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:48,130
<13-7,Phoebe>我有件事要对你坦白
<13-7,Phoebe>I have a confession to make.

00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:55,250
<13-8,Ross>你说什么呢  那不是女生
<13-8,Ross>What are you talking about? It wasn't a girl.

364
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:58,070
<13-8,Ross>是个魁梧大汉
<13-8,Ross>It was this huge dude.

365
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:01,770
<13-9,Phoebe>你用说谎  我知道是个十四岁女生
<13-9,Phoebe>You don't have to lie anymore. I know that it was a 14-year-old girl.

366
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:02,670
<13-10,Ross>不  不是
<13-10,Ross>No, it wasn't.

00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,430
<13-11,Phoebe>是  是的
<13-11,Phoebe>Yes, it was.

368
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,900
<13-12,Ross>你认为我打不过一个十四岁女生吗
<13-12,Ross>You don't think I would have defended myself against a 14-year-old--?

369
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,390
<13-13,Phoebe>"把钱给我  笨蛋"
<13-13,Phoebe>''Give me your money, punk!''

370
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,740
<13-14,Ross>我的天  那是你
<13-14,Ross>Oh, my God, it was you!

371
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:16,630
<13-14,Ross>我不敢相信  是你抢劫了我
<13-14,Ross>I can't believe it. You mugged me?

372
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:21,490
<13-15,Phoebe>是的  我非常抱歉  罗斯  对不起
<13-15,Phoebe>Yeah. And I'm so, so sorry, Ross. I'm sorry.

373
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,390
<13-15,Phoebe>但如果你再想一下  这其实挺不错的
<13-15,Phoebe>But, you know, if you think about it, it's kind of neat.

374
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:27,030
<13-15,Phoebe>我的意思是
<13-15,Phoebe>I mean, well,

375
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:30,350
<13-15,Phoebe>我常常觉得自己像是个局外人
<13-15,Phoebe>it's just that I've always felt kind of like an outsider.

376
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,610
<13-15,Phoebe>你们几个人彼此都认识特别久了
<13-15,Phoebe>You know, the rest of you have connections that go way back...

377
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:38,420
<13-15,Phoebe>而现在  你跟我也有老交情了
<13-15,Phoebe>...and, you know, now you and I have a great one.

378
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:41,370
<13-16,Ross>这并不是好事
<13-16,Ross>It's not the best!

379
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:44,390
<13-17,Phoebe>我知道  请原谅我
<13-17,Phoebe>I know. Please forgive me.

380
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,820
<13-17,Phoebe>我不知道该说什么
<13-17,Phoebe>I don't know what to say.

381
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:47,220
<13-18,Ross>你什么都不用说
<13-18,Ross>There's nothing you can say!

382
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:49,970
<13-18,Ross>那是我这辈子最耻辱的事
<13-18,Ross>That was the most humiliating thing ever.

383
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,440
<13-19,Phoebe>甚至比...
<13-19,Phoebe>Even more humiliating than--

384
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:53,210
<13-20,Ross>我们不要说了
<13-20,Ross>Let's not do this!

385
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,670
<14-1,Intern>然后在广告结尾
<14-1,Intern>And then, at the end of the commercial,

386
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,170
<14-1,Intern>女孩们走出浴缸
<14-1,Intern>the girls get out of the hot tub...

387
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,920
<14-1,Intern>开始一起亲热
<14-1,Intern>...and start making out with each other.

388
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,330
<14-2,Boss>有趣
<14-2,Boss>That's interesting.

389
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:09,250
<14-2,Boss>只有一件事
<14-2,Boss>Just one thought:

390
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:11,550
<14-2,Boss>你没有提到鞋子
<14-2,Boss>You didn't mention the shoes.

391
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:16,340
<14-2,Boss>下一个是谁  钱德勒
<14-2,Boss>Who's next? Chandler.

392
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,560
<14-3,Chandler>开始的画面  一个男人穿上这双鞋
<14-3,Chandler>You start on the image of a guy putting on the shoes.

393
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:20,850
<14-3,Chandler>他大约是我这个年纪
<14-3,Chandler>He's about my age.

394
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:22,550
<14-4,Intern>-你的年纪  -对啊
<14-4,Intern>- Your age?  - Aha!

395
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:27,190
<14-5,Chandler>他在街上滑着  接着失去了控制
<14-5,Chandler>He's rolling down the street and he starts to lose control.

396
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,310
<14-5,Chandler>或许他跌倒了
<14-5,Chandler>Maybe he falls.

397
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,930
<14-5,Chandler>或许还受伤了
<14-5,Chandler>Maybe he hurts himself.

398
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:30,900
<14-5,Chandler>就在这时候
<14-5,Chandler>Just then,

399
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:33,610
<14-5,Chandler>一个小孩  穿着这双鞋  飞快地滑过去
<14-5,Chandler>a kid comes flying by wearing the shoes.

400
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:36,370
<14-5,Chandler>他边笑边从这个男人身上跳过去
<14-5,Chandler>He jumps over the old guy and laughs.

401
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,690
<14-5,Chandler>接着广告词出现…
<14-5,Chandler>And the line reads:

402
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:40,350
<14-5,Chandler>"成人不宜"
<14-5,Chandler>''Not suitable for adults.''

403
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,000
<14-6,Boss>钱德勒  这个很棒
<14-6,Boss>Well, Chandler, that's great.

404
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:45,300
<14-7,Chandler>谢谢你  先生
<14-7,Chandler>Thank you, sir.

405
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,720
<14-7,Chandler>或是  比我小两岁的人
<14-7,Chandler>Or, man who's two years younger than me.

406
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:53,210
<14-8,Boss>你们瞧  这才是清晰的卖点
<14-8,Boss>You see, that has a clear selling point.

407
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,900
<14-8,Boss>抓住了我们主要客户群的心态
<14-8,Boss>It appeals to our key demographic.

408
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:55,950
<14-8,Boss>你是怎么想出来的
<14-8,Boss>How did you come up with that?

409
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,200
<14-8,Boss>我不知道  我不知道
<14-8,Boss>I don't know! I don't know!

410
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,680
<14-9,Chandler>我就是试着用年轻的心态去思考
<14-9,Chandler>I was just trying to get into a young mindset,

411
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:02,770
<14-9,Chandler>然后灵感涌动
<14-9,Chandler>and stuff started to flow.

412
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,910
<14-10,Boss>太棒了  做得好
<14-10,Boss>That is great. Good work.

413
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,620
<14-10,Boss>谢谢
<14-10,Boss>Thank you.

414
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:10,010
<14-11,Boss>那我们大家明天见
<14-11,Boss>We'll see all of you tomorrow.

415
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:22,650
<14-12,Chandler>天一冷  臀部就疼
<14-12,Chandler>The cold weather hurts my hip.

416
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:32,460
<15-1,Phoebe>罗斯  我知道你还在生我的气
<15-1,Phoebe>Hey, Ross. I know you're still mad at me,

417
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:34,530
<15-1,Phoebe>但我可以跟你谈一下吗
<15-1,Phoebe>but can I just talk to you for a sec?

418
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,610
<15-2,Ross>当然  说吧  哦  等等
<15-2,Ross>Sure, go ahead. Oh, sorry.

419
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,710
<15-2,Ross>当然  说吧
<15-2,Ross>Sure, go ahead.

420
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:42,650
<15-3,Phoebe>我真的想要再次跟你道歉
<15-3,Phoebe>I just really wanted to apologize again.

421
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,330
<15-3,Phoebe>而且让你看些
<15-3,Phoebe>And also show you something

422
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:48,240
<15-3,Phoebe>你会觉得很兴奋的东西
<15-3,Phoebe>I think you'll find very exciting.

423
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,600
<15-3,Phoebe>哦  我的天啊
<15-3,Phoebe>Oh, my God!

424
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:52,400
<15-4,Ross>"街头收集来的垃圾"
<15-4,Ross>''Crap from the street!''

425
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,300
<15-5,Phoebe>听着  罗斯  这箱子里
<15-5,Phoebe>Look, Ross. In this box...

426
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,150
<15-5,Phoebe>都是我抢来
<15-5,Phoebe>...are all the things I got from mugging

427
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,980
<15-5,Phoebe>觉得太特别而不想卖掉
<15-5,Phoebe>that I thought were too special to sell...

428
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,630
<15-5,Phoebe>或是  抽掉的东西
<15-5,Phoebe>or smoke.

429
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:11,660
<15-5,Phoebe>反正  我找了一下  找到了...
<15-5,Phoebe>Anyway, I was looking through it, and I found...

430
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,900
<15-8,Ross>《科学小子》
<15-8,Ross>Science Boy.

431
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,980
<15-5,Phoebe>哦  我的天啊
<15-5,Phoebe>Oh, my God!

432
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,220
<15-6,Ross>我没想到还会再见到它
<15-6,Ross>I never thought I'd see this again.

433
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,020
<15-6,Ross>全部都在了
<15-6,Ross>It's all here!

434
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:31,870
<15-6,Ross>你为什么这些年还留着它
<15-6,Ross>What made you save it all these years?

435
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:34,510
<15-7,Phoebe>可能是我觉得它很棒
<15-7,Phoebe>I guess I just thought it was really good.

436
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,140
<15-7,Phoebe>或许有一天会值钱
<15-7,Phoebe>And maybe it would be worth something one day.

437
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:41,420
<15-8,Ross>你真的认为《科学小子》值得收藏
<15-8,Ross>You really thought Science Boy was worth saving?

438
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:43,700
<15-9,Phoebe>是的  但是你应该知道
<15-9,Phoebe>Yeah. But you should know

439
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,120
<15-9,Phoebe>我还留了一罐凡士林
<15-9,Phoebe>I also have a jar of Vaseline

440
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:46,610
<15-9,Phoebe>跟一副猫头骨
<15-9,Phoebe>and a cat skull in here.

441
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:52,270
<15-10,Ross>不管  这还是很惊喜
<15-10,Ross>Still, this is amazing!

442
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,560
<15-10,Ross>我的天  谢谢你  菲比
<15-10,Ross>Oh, my God. Thank you, Phoebe.

443
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:57,770
<15-11,Phoebe>不用客气  谢谢你的《科学小子》
<15-11,Phoebe>You're welcome. Thank you for Science Boy.

444
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,220
<15-11,Phoebe>我从他身上学到很多
<15-11,Phoebe>I learned a lot from him.

445
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,990
<15-12,Ross>你不用客气
<15-12,Ross>You're welcome.

446
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,880
<16-1,Joey>我需要答案
<16-1,Joey>I need an answer!

447
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:07,710
<16-2,Lennart>我无法告诉你我不知道的事
<16-2,Lennart>I can't tell you something I don't know.

448
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,750
<16-3,Joey>你知道的
<16-3,Joey>You know!

<16-8,Lennart>She never loved me. She only loved you.

453
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:28,170
<16-9,Joey>你一直都知道  而你却没有告诉我
<16-9,Joey>You knew this all along and you never told me?

454
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,280
<16-9,Joey>居然没告诉我
<16-9,Joey>You never told me?

455
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:30,240
<16-9,Joey>我永远都不会原谅你
<16-9,Joey>I can never forgive you.

00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:31,420
<16-9,Joey>也永远都不会原谅我自己
<16-9,Joey>I can never forgive you myself.
