00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,560
<3-26,Joey>就说她不是结婚的料

100
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:03,950
<3-29,Monica>这会让他心碎
<3-29,Monica>It's gonna break his heart.

101
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,440
<3-29,Monica>他一定会觉得我不爱他了
<3-29,Monica>He's gonna think l don't love him anymore.

00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:09,100
<3-47,Ross>-我们哪有结婚  -怎么可能  别闹了
<3-47,Ross>- Hello. We didn't get married. - No, we didn't. That's ridi- -

119
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:17,800
<3-49,Ross>等等...我记得去过教堂
<3-49,Ross>Wait, wait, wait. l remember being in a chapel.

120
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,700
<3-51,Ross>我们醉成那样
<3-51,Ross>They...they would not let us get married

121
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,440
<3-51,Ross>不可能被批准
<3-51,Ross>when we were that drunk.

122
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,600
<3-53,Joey>他们当然会批准
<3-53,Joey>They let you get married when you are drunk.

123
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,270
<3-53,Joey>在赌城结婚的人通常都醉醺醺的
<3-53,Joey>Most people who marry in Vegas are drunk.

124
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,110
<3-54,Phoebe>我现在就醉了
<3-54,Phoebe>Now, l'm drunk right now.

125
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:34,730
<3-54,Phoebe>早餐不能喝鸡尾酒啊   我在度假呢
<3-54,Phoebe>l can't have a mimosa with breakfast? l'm on vacation.

126
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,670
<3-55,Monica>你们要怎么办
<3-55,Monica>What are you gonna do?

127
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:39,260
<3-56,Rachel>看来得找个离婚律师了
<3-56,Rachel>Well, l guess we find a divorce lawyer.

128
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:42,430
<3-57,Chandler>我想罗斯已经有人选了
<3-57,Chandler>Well, l think- -  l think Ross already has one.

129
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:46,480
<3-57,Chandler>这次会免费吧
<3-57,Chandler>Now, this one's free, right?

130
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,280
<3-57,Chandler>前两次你都付钱了  所以会白送一次
<3-57,Chandler>Because you paid for the first two, the third one for free.

131
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,810
<3-58,Ross>尽管笑吧  丢脸的可是你
<3-58,Ross>Laugh it up, but the joke's on you...

132
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:55,240
<3-58,Ross>因为我们不必离婚

<3-65,Phoebe>你爱"离婚"爱到搞不好会娶了"它"
<3-65,Phoebe>You love divorce so much, you're probably gonna marry it...

144
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:29,860
<3-65,Phoebe>然后婚姻破裂
<3-65,Phoebe>...and then it won't work out,

00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:32,230
<3-65,Phoebe>你又得离婚  离婚男
<3-65,Phoebe>so you're gonna have to divorce it, divorcing guy.

00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,700
<4-5,Monica>昨晚我们让骰子决定
<4-5,Monica>Last night we let the dice decide.

155
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,330
<4-5,Monica>也许应该再把决定权留给命运
<4-5,Monica>We should leave it up to fate again.

156
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:08,800
<4-5,Monica>我爱你

00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,180
<4-6,Chandler>有征兆  我们才结婚
<4-6,Chandler>We don't get married unless there's a sign.

158
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,420
<4-6,Chandler>这样
<4-6,Chandler>So say...

159
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:16,350
<4-6,Chandler>要是你又掷出个八来
<4-6,Chandler>say you roll another eight, then there's a definite sign...

160
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:18,300
<5-4,Joey>-就表示我们绝对应该结婚  -好的
<5-4,Joey>- ...that we should marry. - All right.

164
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:25,150
<4-8,Chandler>听起来不错
<4-8,Chandler>Sounds great.

165
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,050
<4-9,Monica>有人要来试试手气
<4-9,Monica>Hey, we got a shooter.

<4-15,Croupler>Eight, easy eight.

171
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,010
<4-16,Monica>真不敢相信我扔出个八
<4-16,Monica>l can't believe l rolled an eight.

172
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:47,550
<4-17,Chandler>真是太不可能了
<4-17,Chandler>That was so unlikely.

173
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,730
<4-17,Chandler>那我们就结婚吧
<4-17,Chandler>Well, let's get married.

174
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:52,040
<4-17,Chandler>唯有这样啦
<4-17,Chandler>l guess.

175
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:55,740
<4-18,Monica>这不是双四八  我昨晚掷的是双四八
<4-18,Monica>That wasn't a hard eight! Last night l rolled a hard eight.

176
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,210
<4-19,Chandler>说得对  这个八不对
<4-19,Chandler>That's right! lt was the wrong kind of eight.

177
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:59,210
<4-19,Chandler>不能结婚了  真可惜
<4-19,Chandler>No wedding! Damn it!

178
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:01,190
<4-20,Monica>人家超想结婚的
<4-20,Monica>l wanted it so bad!

179
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,280
<4-20,Monica>-去收拾行李吗  -好
<4-20,Monica>- Wanna go pack? - Yeah.

180
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,780
<4-21,Chandler>我们这么做没错吧
<4-21,Chandler>We're doing the right thing, right?

181
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,400
<4-22,Monica>当然没错
<4-22,Monica>Of course we are.

182
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,440
<4-22,Monica>我们让命运决定了
<4-22,Monica>We left it up to fate.

183
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,040
<4-22,Monica>如果我们应该结婚
<4-22,Monica>lf we were supposed to get married,

184
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,900
<4-22,Monica>一定会有明确的征兆
<4-22,Monica>there would be a clear cut sign.

185
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:30,060
<5-1,Phoebe>好  你还剩十九个问题  要好好把握哦
<5-1,Phoebe>Okay, you have 19 questions left. Use them wisely.

<5-5,Phoebe>And until then, you are going to sing to me...

196
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:02,160
<5-5,Phoebe>因为收音机坏了  你又很自私
<5-5,Phoebe>...because the radio's broken and you are selfish,

197
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,260
<5-5,Phoebe>但歌声却很好听

<7-8,Ross>you check the box that says, "Mrs."

227
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,300
<7-8,Ross>就在"未婚"旁边
