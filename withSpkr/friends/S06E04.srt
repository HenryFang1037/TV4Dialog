00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,660
<10-1,Chandler>我拜托你去医院吧
<10-1,Chandler>Will you go to the hospital?

254
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,870
<10-2,Joey>疝气手术...
<10-2,Joey>Dude, hernia operations cost like...

255
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,370
<10-2,Joey>应该很贵  对吧
<10-2,Joey>...a lot probably, okay?

256
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:57,940
<10-2,Joey>而且它越来越黑  越来越痛
<10-2,Joey>Besides, it's getting darker and more painful.

257
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,910
<10-2,Joey>就表示有在好转
<10-2,Joey>That means it's healing.

258
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,840
<10-3,Chandler>我借你钱
<10-3,Chandler>Look, l'll loan you the money.

259
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,090
<10-3,Chandler>赶快去医院
<10-3,Chandler>Just go to the hospital

260
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:05,800
<10-3,Chandler>把那玩意儿...
<10-3,Chandler>and let's just get that thing...

261
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:08,090
<10-3,Chandler>塞回去
<10-3,Chandler>...pushed back in.

262
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:09,500
<10-3,Chandler>心领了
<10-3,Chandler>Thank you,

263
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,180
<10-4,Joey>但我要很久才能还你钱
<10-4,Joey>but it'd take me forever to pay you the money back.

264
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,730
<10-4,Joey>我不想老惦记着欠你钱
<10-4,Joey>l don't want that hanging over my head, okay?

265
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:16,840
<10-4,Joey>而且只要医保恢复
<10-4,Joey>Besides, when my insurance kicks in...

266
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,690
<10-4,Joey>我就可以动各种免费手术
<10-4,Joey>...l can get all the free operations l want.

267
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:23,020
<10-4,Joey>我打算先去做"激光眼"手术
<10-4,Joey>l'll probably start with that laser eye surgery.

268
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:28,330
<10-8,Phoebe>怎么了
<10-8,Phoebe>What's going on?

269
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:29,910
<10-8,Phoebe>乔伊的疝气很严重
<10-8,Phoebe>Joey's got a really bad hernia,

270
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:32,790
<10-9,Chandler>不过动个"激光眼"手术就能搞定了
<10-9,Chandler>but it's nothing a little laser eye surgery won't fix.

271
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,520
<10-10,Joey>真的  我告诉你
<10-10,Joey>Look, l'm telling you,

272
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,030
<10-10,Joey>把手压在肚子这里
<10-10,Joey>if l put my hand on my stomach...

273
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:39,250
<10-10,Joey>就不会疼得那么厉害
<10-10,Joey>...it doesn't hurt that bad.

274
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,610
<10-11,Phoebe>搞不好你会死
<10-11,Phoebe>Hey, maybe you'll die!

275
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,730
<10-12,Joey>钱德勒  我怕了
<10-12,Joey>Chandler, l'm scared.

276
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:47,970
<10-13,Phoebe>我们可以共赴黄泉
<10-13,Phoebe>No, we can go together.

277
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:49,470
<10-13,Phoebe>但不要拖太久  好吗
<10-13,Phoebe>Just don't wait too long though, okay?

278
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:52,010
<10-13,Phoebe>因为我星期五之前就会挂掉
<10-13,Phoebe>Because l'm out of here sometime before Friday.

279
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:55,940
<10-15,Phoebe>-但是我不想死  -别怕  会很好玩的
<10-15,Phoebe>- But l don't want to die. - No, lt'll be fun.

280
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:58,330
<10-15,Phoebe>我们可以回来吓唬他们
<10-15,Phoebe>We'll come back and haunt these guys!

281
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,290
<11-2,Rachel>-给我  -不要  这是我的
<11-2,Rachel>- Give me them! - No, they are mine!

282
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,630
<11-3,Monica>-是你偷我的  -是你偷我的
<11-3,Monica>- You stole them from me! - You stole them from me!

283
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:09,890
<11-3,Monica>拿来
<11-3,Monica>Give me them!

284
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,630
<11-6,Monica>要不要一人一个
<11-6,Monica>Just wanna each take one?

285
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:17,350
<11-7,Rachel>很公平  反正也没用过
<11-7,Rachel>Yeah, that seems fair. We never use them.

286
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:22,420
<11-8,Ross>听着  你们真的得帮帮我
<11-8,Ross>Look, l really need some help, okay?

287
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:26,280
<11-8,Ross>为什么  为什么我要装英国腔
<11-8,Ross>Why? Why did l have to speak in a British accent?

288
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,670
<11-8,Ross>我该怎么办
<11-8,Ross>What do l do?

289
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,690
<11-10,Monica>为什么不把口音改掉
<11-10,Monica>Why don't you phase it out?

290
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,890
<11-10,Monica>对啊  慢慢把口音改掉
<11-10,Monica>Yeah, phase the accent out.

291
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:35,070
<11-10,Monica>别人会以为你在适应美国的生活
<11-10,Monica>People will think, you know, you're adjusting to life in America.

292
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:37,910
<11-11,Rachel>是啊  罗斯  根本不会有人注意到
<11-11,Rachel>Yeah, I mean come on, Ross. No one will even notice.

293
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,330
<11-11,Rachel>搞不好根本就没人听你在讲课
<11-11,Rachel>I mean they're probably not even listening to you.

294
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:43,920
<11-12,Ross>没人听我在讲课吗
<11-12,Ross>They're not listening to me?

295
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,700
<11-13,Rachel>当然有啦
<11-13,Rachel>Of course they're listening to you.

296
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,010
<11-13,Rachel>大家都在听你在讲课
<11-13,Rachel>Everybody listens to you.

<11-13,Rachel>Monica,

298
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:52,610
<11-14,Ross>你真的觉得我该试着慢慢改掉吗
<11-14,Ross>do you think l should try this phasing-out thing?

299
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:54,090
<11-15,Monica>我觉得你很帅啊
