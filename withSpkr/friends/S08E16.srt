1
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:09,580
<2-10,Ross>你刚刚说是瑞秋吗
<2-10,Ross>I'm sorry, did you just say it's Rachel?

2
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,130
<2-11,Joey>对

3
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,630
<2-12,Ross>你喜欢瑞秋

00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:23,310
<2-13,Joey>对  我喜欢瑞秋
<2-13,Joey>Yes. I like Rachel.

5
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,070
<2-14,Ross>瑞秋
<2-14,Ross>Rachel?!

6
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,140
<2-15,Joey>对  听着  你知道的
<2-15,Joey>Yeah. Okay, but look, you know...

7
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,850
<2-15,Joey>你知道我还喜欢谁吗  你
<2-15,Joey>You know who else I like? You.

8
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,960
<2-15,Joey>这句话我说得不够多  我喜欢你  罗斯
<2-15,Joey>And it doesn't get said enough. I like you, Ross.

9
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:47,360
<2-17,Joey>-那个"瑞秋"  -没什么大不了的
<2-17,Joey>- "Rachel" Rachel? - It's not a big deal.

10
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,420
<2-17,Joey>没什么大不了的  抱歉  我只是...
<2-17,Joey>It's not a big deal? I'm sorry, I just...

11
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:54,460
<2-18,Ross>那你刚刚说的那些话呢
<2-18,Ross>What about the stuff you said?

12
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:57,210
<2-18,Ross>你说你没法不去想她
<2-18,Ross>How you can't stop thinking about her?

13
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,210
<2-19,Joey>你说你睡不着
<2-19,Joey>How you can't sleep?

14
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:01,630
<2-19,Joey>我是个演员  你知道吗
<2-19,Joey>I'm an actor, you know?

15
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:05,150
<2-19,Joey>我们演员习惯了夸大事实
<2-19,Joey>As a group, we tend to be overdramatic.

16
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,050
<2-20,Ross>怀着我孩子的瑞秋
<2-20,Ross>Rachel-who's-carrying-my-baby Rachel?

17
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:12,710
<2-21,Joey>我知道这样很不好  这样是不对的  好吗
<2-21,Joey>I know it's bad. And I know it's wrong, okay?

18
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:15,800
<2-21,Joey>但我们不可能在一起啊
<2-21,Joey>But it's not like anything's ever gonna happen.

19
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,780
<2-21,Joey>那只是我的一时好感  会慢慢变淡的
<2-21,Joey>These are just feelings. They'll go away.

20
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,650
<2-22,Ross>我得走了
<2-22,Ross>You know, I gotta go.

21
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:23,580
<2-23,Joey>别这样  罗斯
<2-23,Joey>Hey, come on, Ross...

22
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,940
<2-24,Ross>我只是...  我只有一个...  瑞秋
<2-24,Ross>I just... You know, I just have one... Rachel?!

23
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,710
<2-24,Ross>瑞秋
<2-24,Ross>Rachel?!

24
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,480
<2-24,Ross>瑞秋
<2-24,Ross>Rachel?!

36
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,800
<3-1,Rachel>她在踢我
<3-1,Rachel>Okay, she's kicking.

37
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:26,880
<3-2,Chandler>她在你的体内成长
<3-2,Chandler>She's growing inside you.

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,460
<3-5,Rachel>这一下踢得好用力
<3-5,Rachel>That was a big one.

39
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:33,280
<3-6,Chandler>她是拒绝过我最年轻的女孩
<3-6,Chandler>I think that's the youngest girl ever to reject me.

40
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,440
<3-7,Phoebe>-大家好  -嗨
<3-7,Phoebe>- You guys! - Hey there.

41
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,960
<3-8,Chandler>我来问你们  你们相信有灵魂伴侣吗
<3-8,Chandler>Listen let me ask you. Do you believe in soul mates?

42
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,030
<3-10,Phoebe>我相信
<3-10,Phoebe>Oh, yes, I do.

43
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,750
<3-11,Rachel>我认为每个人都有
<3-11,Rachel>I do. I believe that there is one perfect person

44
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,030
<3-11,Rachel>失落的另一半
<3-11,Rachel>out there for everyone.

45
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:47,270
<3-11,Rachel>你知道你该怎么找到他吗  停下寻找的步伐
<3-11,Rachel>You know how you find him? You stop looking for him.

46
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,500
<3-11,Rachel>所以我已经不去费劲寻找罗素·克洛了[演员]
<3-11,Rachel>That's why I stopped looking for Russell Crowe.

47
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,790
<3-11,Rachel>他会找到我的
<3-11,Rachel>He'll find me.

48
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,010
<3-12,Phoebe>你呢
<3-12,Phoebe>And you?

49
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:57,300
<3-13,Chandler>不  我相信有些人彼此适合
<3-13,Chandler>No. I believe that certain people are more suited for each other,

50
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,450
<3-13,Chandler>我也相信两人可以相爱  但...
<3-13,Chandler>and I believe in falling in love, but...

51
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:02,330
<3-13,Chandler>-我不相信存在灵魂伴侣  -很好
<3-13,Chandler>- Soul mates? I don't think they exist. - Okay, good.

52
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,260
<3-15,Chandler>-怎么了  -昨晚我遇到了莫妮卡的灵魂伴侣
<3-15,Chandler>- Why? - Well, last night, I met Monica's.

53
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,960
<3-16,Phoebe>-什么  -没错
<3-16,Phoebe>- What? - Yeah.

54
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,250
<3-18,Phoebe>跟我约会的那个男人
<3-18,Phoebe>I had a date with this guy.

55
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:15,360
<3-18,Phoebe>我发誓他是她的另一半
<3-18,Phoebe>And I swear to god he's her other half.

56
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,610
<3-19,Chandler>别犯傻了  你不觉得会有人
<3-19,Chandler>Come on, don't be crazy. You don't think there's somebody out there

57
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:20,040
<3-19,Chandler>比我更适合莫妮卡吧
<3-19,Chandler>better suited for Monica than me, do you?

58
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,140
<3-20,Rachel>他长什么样子
<3-20,Rachel>Well, what's he like?

59
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,440
<3-22,Rachel>-他很高  棕发  -当然
<3-22,Rachel>- He's tall. He has brown hair. - Of course.

60
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,660
<3-23,Phoebe>一个发色跟我一样的高大男人
<3-23,Phoebe>A tall guy with hair similar to mine?

61
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,670
<3-25,Chandler>宇宙真的神秘莫测
<3-25,Chandler>Oh, unknowable universe!

62
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,060
<3-26,Phoebe>他从事跟食物相关的行业
<3-26,Phoebe>He works with food.

63
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,340
<3-27,Rachel>当然  年纪比较大吗
<3-27,Rachel>Oh, sure. Older?

64
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,170
<3-28,Phoebe>没错  他是英国人
<3-28,Phoebe>Obviously. And he's British.

65
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:41,050
<3-29,Rachel>-我正打算要问你  -是啊
<3-29,Rachel>- I was just gonna ask! - Yeah.

66
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:45,980
<3-30,Phoebe>他非常聪明  成熟  有自信
<3-30,Phoebe>And he's so centered, and mature and confident.

67
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:48,510
<3-31,Rachel>真可惜他们彼此不认识
<3-31,Rachel>It's so sad they never had a chance to meet.

68
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:52,240
<3-32,Chandler>还好她老公没听到你说这种话
<3-32,Chandler>Luckily, the guy she settled for can't hear what you're talking about.

69
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,410
<3-33,Phoebe>抱歉  我可能搞错了
<3-33,Phoebe>Oh, I'm so sorry. Maybe I'm wrong.

70
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:59,210
<3-33,Phoebe>我会再跟他约会  对他进一步了解
<3-33,Phoebe>I'm gonna go out with him again. I'll find out more.

71
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,590
<3-34,Chandler>你明明觉得他跟别人是天生一对
<3-34,Chandler>You believe that this guy is destined for someone else

72
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:02,760
<3-34,Chandler>你还要跟他约会
<3-34,Chandler>and you're still gonna date him?

73
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,910
<3-35,Phoebe>虽说他不是我的灵魂伴侣  但我总得吃饭吧
<3-35,Phoebe>He may not be my soul mate, but a girl's gotta eat.

74
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:16,380
<4-3,Monica>我刚跟乔伊谈过  我想知道你好不好
<4-3,Monica>I just talked to Joey. I wanted to see you how you were.

75
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:20,280
<4-4,Ross>我还是不敢相信  乔伊跟瑞秋
<4-4,Ross>I still can't believe it. Joey and Rachel?

76
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:24,150
<4-4,Ross>就像是你跟我交往  只不过更奇怪
<4-4,Ross>It's like you and me going out, only weirder.

77
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:27,530
<4-5,Monica>我知道你很难过  我也想安慰你...
<4-5,Monica>I know you're hurting, and I want to be supportive,

78
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:29,210
<4-5,Monica>但别再说那种话了
<4-5,Monica>...but don't say that again.

79
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,410
<4-6,Ross>他们要是结婚了怎么办
<4-6,Ross>Oh, my god. What if they get married?

80
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,530
<4-6,Ross>他可能做我孩子的继父
<4-6,Ross>He'd be the stepfather of my child.

81
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:37,850
<4-7,Monica>我觉得你不必担心这种事情
<4-7,Monica>Honey, I don't think that's something we need to worry about!

82
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:40,920
<4-7,Monica>他不会把自己的感觉告诉她
<4-7,Monica>First of all, he'll never tell her how he feels about her.

83
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,980
<4-7,Monica>就算他说了 你也不知道她会有什么反应
<4-7,Monica>And even if he did, you have no idea how she'd react.

84
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:47,310
<4-8,Ross>女人从来就不喜欢乔伊  我觉得他还是处男
<4-8,Ross>Sure, women never like Joey. I think he's a virgin.

85
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:53,200
<4-9,Monica>-他根本就没想过要追瑞秋  -真的吗
<4-9,Monica>- Joey isn't even thinking about going after Rachel. - He's not?

86
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,230
<4-10,Ross>对  他关心的是你对此事的反应
<4-10,Ross>No, all he's thinking about is how you're taking this.

87
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,060
<4-11,Monica>这件事把他吓坏了
<4-11,Monica>Listen, it's completely freaking him out.

88
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:01,300
<4-11,Monica>他甚至想搬到佛蒙特州去
<4-11,Monica>He's talking about moving to Vermont.

89
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:05,200
<4-13,Monica>-为什么  -他想离开这个国家
<4-13,Monica>- Why? - He says he wants to leave the country.

90
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,700
<4-13,Monica>他觉得你恨他
<4-13,Monica>He thinks you hate him.

91
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,280
<4-14,Ross>恨他
<4-14,Ross>Hate him?

92
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,800
<4-14,Ross>不  我不恨他
<4-14,Ross>No, I don't hate him.

93
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:23,760
<4-14,Ross>那可是瑞秋  你知道吗
<4-14,Ross>It's just, it's Rachel. You know?

94
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,620
<4-15,Monica>我无法想像你有多难过...
<4-15,Monica>I can't even imagine how hard this must be for you...

95
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,940
<4-15,Monica>但我不希望你跟乔伊因此做不成朋友
<4-15,Monica>...but I don't want you to lose Joey over it.

96
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:36,040
<4-15,Monica>现在他想知道你是不是还把他当朋友
<4-15,Monica>Right now, he just needs to know that you're still his friend.

97
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,220
<4-16,Ross>好吧  我会跟他谈
<4-16,Ross>Okay, I'll talk to him.

98
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,320
<4-17,Monica>你最好快去
<4-17,Monica>Do it soon.

99
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:48,010
<4-17,Monica>他刚刚问我怎么把美金换成佛蒙特货币
<4-17,Monica>He just asked me how to convert his dollars into Vermont money.

<5-9,Don>那家餐厅的番茄干是怎么回事
<5-9,Don>What's with the sun-dried tomatoes in that place?

<5-24,Phoebe>他们不过是聊天而已
<5-24,Phoebe>They're just talking, and you know what?

127
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:08,850
<5-24,Phoebe>就算我认为他们是灵魂伴侣
<5-24,Phoebe>Just because I think they're soul mates

128
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:11,000
<5-24,Phoebe>那也不代表会发生什么事
<5-24,Phoebe>doesn't mean anything'll happen.

129
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,600
<5-25,Monica>菲比  做得好

<5-28,Phoebe>别担心  我们会帮你再找个老婆
<5-28,Phoebe>Don't worry, we'll find you someone else.

132
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:39,360
<6-3,Joey>如果你是来打我的  我能理解  这是我活该
<6-3,Joey>I understand if you came by to hit me. I deserve it.

133
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,340
<6-4,Ross>不  我不想打你
<6-4,Ross>No, I don't want to hit you.

134
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,920
<6-5,Joey>怎么  你要踢我
<6-5,Joey>What, then? Kick me?

135
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:46,150
<6-6,Ross>不

<6-8,Ross>我只想告诉你  我没有生你的气
<6-8,Ross>I just want to tell you that I'm not mad at you...

139
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:59,640
<6-8,Ross>我当然也不恨你
<6-8,Ross>...and that I certainly do not hate you.

140
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,380
<6-8,Ross>我只是来告诉你这些
<6-8,Ross>I just came here to say that.

141
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,300
<6-8,Ross>等一下  罗斯
<6-8,Ross>Hey, wait, Ross, Ross?

142
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:10,690
<6-9,Joey>你想进来喝瓶啤酒吗
<6-9,Joey>You wanna come in for a beer or something?

143
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:15,450
<6-10,Ross>好吧
<6-10,Ross>Yeah, sure.

144
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,820
<6-11,Joey>你带啤酒了吗
<6-11,Joey>You got any beer?

145
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:28,820
<6-11,Joey>我只有瑞秋留下的香瓜饮料
<6-11,Joey>All I got is melon stuff that Rachel left.

146
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:30,220
<6-12,Ross>好吧
<6-12,Ross>Okay.

147
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:41,120
<6-13,Joey>罗斯  有件事你得知道
<6-13,Joey>Look, Ross. You need to understand something, okay?

148
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:42,760
<6-13,Joey>我...
<6-13,Joey>I...

149
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,630
<6-13,Joey>我绝不会对瑞秋采取行动  好吧
<6-13,Joey>I am never gonna act on this Rachel thing, okay?

150
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:52,950
<6-13,Joey>我不会做出任何会危及你我友谊的事
<6-13,Joey>I wouldn't do anything to jeopardize my friendship with you.

151
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:56,860
<6-14,Ross>谢谢
<6-14,Ross>Thank you.

152
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:17,530
<6-15,Joey>总之  我只是...
<6-15,Joey>Anyway, it'll just...

153
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:21,210
<6-15,Joey>我得花点时间去淡忘
<6-15,Joey>It'll take me a while to get over her, that's all.

154
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,510
<6-15,Joey>我不确定我该怎么做
<6-15,Joey>I'm not even sure how to do that,

155
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:25,830
<6-15,Joey>我以前从没陷入过爱河  所以
<6-15,Joey>I mean I've never been in love before, so...

156
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,620
<6-15,Joey>什么
<6-15,Joey>What?

157
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,930
<6-16,Ross>你爱上她了吗
<6-16,Ross>You're in love with her?

158
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,600
<6-17,Joey>-对  我以为你知道  -不知道
<6-17,Joey>- Yeah. I thought you knew that. - No.

159
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:41,190
<6-19,Joey>听着  如果有帮助的话
<6-19,Joey>Look, if it helps,

160
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:44,150
<6-19,Joey>我真的也不希望自己有那种感觉
<6-19,Joey>I don't want to feel this way, honest.

161
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,650
<6-19,Joey>我只是一直在想
<6-19,Joey>I just keep thinking,

162
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:48,400
<6-19,Joey>"我得忘了这件事"  你知道吗
<6-19,Joey>"I'll get over this," you know?

163
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:51,630
<6-19,Joey>但我越努力就越忘不了
<6-19,Joey>But it just keeps getting harder.

164
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:57,040
<6-19,Joey>我不知道该怎么办
<6-19,Joey>I don't know what to do, you know?

165
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,600
<6-20,Ross>我该怎么办
<6-20,Ross>I don't... What do I do?

166
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,570
<6-20,Ross>我觉得你该告诉她你的感觉
<6-20,Ross>I think you need to tell her how you feel.

167
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,940
<6-21,Joey>你一定是被这饮料冲昏了头
<6-21,Joey>Okay, that's the green stuff talking.

168
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:18,260
<6-22,Ross>我是认真的  你得知道她的感觉
<6-22,Ross>No, I'm serious. You need to find out where she is.

169
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,780
<6-22,Ross>如果她不喜欢你
<6-22,Ross>Because if she's not where you are,

170
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:22,150
<6-22,Ross>你就可以放下了
<6-22,Ross>then you can start to move past this.

171
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,870
<6-23,Joey>但如果...  我不是说她会这么说
<6-23,Joey>But what if, and I'm not saying she will be...

172
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:28,330
<6-24,Ross>如果她喜欢你...
<6-24,Ross>If she is where you are, then...

173
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:34,470
<6-24,Ross>那我的感受不该妨碍到你们
<6-24,Ross>...then my feeling weird shouldn't stand in the way.

174
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:38,260
<6-25,Joey>-你确定  -对
<6-25,Joey>- Are you sure? - Yeah.

175
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:43,140
<6-26,Ross>如果她要跟别的男人在一起...
<6-26,Ross>Look, if she's gonna end up with somebody else...

176
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:45,960
<6-26,Ross>说真的  她找不到更好的人选了
<6-26,Ross>...the truth is, she couldn't find a better guy, so...

177
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,180
<6-27,Joey>谢谢
<6-27,Joey>Hey, thanks.

178
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,200
<6-28,Ross>你准备什么时候要跟她谈
<6-28,Ross>So when do you think you're gonna talk to her?

179
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,160
<6-29,Joey>天啊  我得跟她谈
<6-29,Joey>Oh, my God. I have to tell her.

180
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,880
<6-29,Joey>我还没有想过  我该说什么
<6-29,Joey>I haven't thought about what I will say. What should I say?

181
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,550
<6-30,Ross>我能体谅你  但不要太过激动了
<6-30,Ross>I'm understanding, but let's not get carried away.

182
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,980
<6-30,Ross>抱歉
<6-30,Ross>I'm sorry. Sorry.

183
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,040
<6-31,Joey>我该说什么
<6-31,Joey>What am I gonna say?

184
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:15,120
<6-32,Ross>我也觉得超难喝
<6-32,Ross>Yeah, tell me about it.

185
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:32,170
<7-1,Don>我逐渐放弃了红酒进口的问题
<7-1,Don>So I've been slowly phasing out the wine importing

186
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:35,240
<7-1,Don>现在全力研究奶酪
<7-1,Don>and focusing more on the cheese side of things.

187
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,630
<7-2,Chandler>你说奶酪吗
<7-2,Chandler>Cheese, you say?

188
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:40,090
<7-2,Chandler>这研究起来可真够臭气熏天的  唐
<7-2,Chandler>That's some pretty smelly work, huh, Don?

189
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:44,620
<7-3,Don>-对不起  -奶酪很臭
<7-3,Don>- Excuse me? - Cheese. It's smelly.

190
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:48,180
<7-4,Chandler>你一定也经常臭气四溢
<7-4,Chandler>You must smell a lot of the time too.

191
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:53,400
<7-5,Don>不会的  但我觉得奶酪
<7-5,Don>Not really. But when it comes to cheese,

192
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:55,870
<7-5,Don>越臭越好
<7-5,Don>I'm one of the people who thinks the smellier, the better.

193
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:57,920
<7-6,Monica>我也是  钱德勒就受不了
<7-6,Monica>Me too! Chandler can't stand it.

194
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,960
<7-6,Monica>他都不让我在家吃蓝纹奶酪
<7-6,Monica>He won't even allow me to have blue cheese in the house.

195
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,760
<7-7,Don>那你还嫁给了他
<7-7,Don>And you're still married to him?

196
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:09,480
<7-8,Monica>知道我想干嘛吗
<7-8,Monica>You know what I'd love to do?

197
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:14,190
<7-8,Monica>我想去法国  只吃面包跟奶酪
<7-8,Monica>I would like to go to France and eat nothing but bread and cheese.

198
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:16,300
<7-8,Monica>甚至连面包都不吃  只要奶酪
<7-8,Monica>Not even bread. Just cheese.

199
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,010
<7-8,Monica>不  我要面包
<7-8,Monica>No, I want the bread.

200
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,650
<7-8,Monica>还有油酥饼
<7-8,Monica>And pastries.

201
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,850
<7-8,Monica>跟小蛋糕
<7-8,Monica>And pate.

202
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,660
<7-8,Monica>我并不是真的兴奋  只是以前我很胖
<7-8,Monica>I'm really not high. It's just I used to be fat.

203
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:30,390
<7-9,Don>我在罗亚尔谷有栋别墅
<7-9,Don>Well if you where ever enter the Loire valley let me know,

204
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:32,080
<7-9,Don>你如果去法国可以住在那里
<7-9,Don>I've got a great little villa you can stay at.

205
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,880
<7-10,Chandler>是用奶酪做的吗
<7-10,Chandler>Is it made of cheese?

206
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:40,940
<7-11,Don>不是  不过用奶酪做的房子  简直宛如天堂
<7-11,Don>No. A house made of cheese, wouldn't that be incredible?

207
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:43,120
<7-12,Monica>-我明天就想搬进去  -少来了
<7-12,Monica>- I'd move in tomorrow! - Oh, come on!

208
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:47,970
<7-13,Chandler>-你听到了吗  -对不起
<7-13,Chandler>- Are you listening to this! - I'm so sorry.

209
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:49,450
<7-15,Chandler>-我们该怎么办  -我不知道
<7-15,Chandler>- What do we do? - I don't know.

210
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:51,790
<7-16,Phoebe>他们都想住在奶酪屋里
<7-16,Phoebe>They both want to live in a house of cheese.

211
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,790
<7-16,Phoebe>我不知道你该拿什么去抗争
<7-16,Phoebe>I don't know how you fight that.

212
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:04,810
<8-1,Joey>好吧  我能做到
<8-1,Joey>Okay, okay. I can do this.

241
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,210
<9-8,Chandler>但你们两个一拍即合

00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:33,070
<9-8,Chandler>如果你想跟唐住在奶酪屋里
<9-8,Chandler>So, look, I won't stand in your way if you wanna run off with Don

243
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:34,940
<9-8,Chandler>我可以退出
<9-8,Chandler>and live in a house of cheese.

244
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:38,200
<9-9,Monica>钱德勒  你不相信灵魂伴侣
<9-9,Monica>Chandler, you don't believe in soul mates?

245
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,450
<9-10,Chandler>对  但我相信"番茄干先生"相信
<9-10,Chandler>No, but I'm sure "tomahtoes" does.

246
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:44,860
<9-11,Monica>我也不相信灵魂伴侣
<9-11,Monica>I don't believe in soul mates, either.

247
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,450
<9-12,Chandler>-你不相信吗  -对
<9-12,Chandler>- You don't? - Nope.

248
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:50,500
<9-13,Monica>我觉得我们并非注定要在一起
<9-13,Monica>I don't think you and I were destined to end up together.

249
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:54,190
<9-13,Monica>而是陷入爱河  努力经营我们的感情
<9-13,Monica>I think that we fell in love and work hard at our relationship.

250
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:56,280
<9-13,Monica>有时候要加倍努力经营
<9-13,Monica>Some days we work really hard.

251
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:01,280
<9-14,Chandler>那你不想跟唐住在奶酪屋里吗
<9-14,Chandler>So you don't want to live with Don in a cheese house?

252
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,670
<9-15,Monica>不  我后来又仔细想了一下
<9-15,Monica>No, I've had second thoughts about that.

253
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,990
<9-15,Monica>你知道打扫起来有多辛苦吗
<9-15,Monica>Do you realize how hard it'd be to clean?

254
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,710
<9-16,Chandler>-我爱你  -我知道
<9-16,Chandler>- I love you. - I know.

255
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,750
<9-17,Monica>我今晚要带你去吃晚餐
<9-17,Monica>You know what? I'm gonna take you out to dinner tonight.

256
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,260
<9-18,Chandler>那家餐馆的墨西哥辣椒卷
<9-18,Chandler>I found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks

257
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,130
<9-18,Chandler>天下无双
<9-18,Chandler>and jalepino poppers.

258
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:21,970
<9-18,Chandler>不吃吗  真的很好吃
<9-18,Chandler>No? Really? They taste so good.

259
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,820
<10-1,Rachel>我知道钱德勒只是开玩笑
<10-1,Rachel>And I know Chandler is kidding,

260
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,000
<10-1,Rachel>但他每次一摸我的肚子就会这样
<10-1,Rachel>but it happens whenever he touches my stomach.

261
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,570
<10-1,Rachel>我真的担心宝宝不喜欢他
<10-1,Rachel>I mean I'm really worried the baby won't like him.

262
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:40,620
<10-1,Rachel>-你没事吧  -没事
<10-1,Rachel>- Are you okay? - Yeah, sure.

263
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,820
<10-2,Joey>听着  我之所以...
<10-2,Joey>Look, the reason...

264
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,220
<10-2,Joey>这里很热吗
<10-2,Joey>Is it hot in here?

265
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:54,640
<10-3,Rachel>我不觉得  不过你可以把毛衣脱掉
<10-3,Rachel>Not for me, but why don't you take off your sweater?

266
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:57,220
<10-4,Joey>我也想  但这个地方挺上档次
<10-4,Joey>I would, but this is a nice place...

267
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:01,180
<10-4,Joey>而我的T恤上印了卡尔文干荷比丝的图案
<10-4,Joey>...and my T-shirt has a picture of Calvin doing Hobbes.

269
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:06,120
<10-5,Rachel>天啊  真的吗  我能看一下吗
<10-5,Rachel>Oh, my God, really? Can I see it?

270
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,370
<10-6,Joey>当然可以
<10-6,Joey>Yeah, sure.

271
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,960
<10-7,Rachel>我觉得荷比丝可不想那么"干"
<10-7,Rachel>I wouldn't think Hobbes would like that so much.

272
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:22,240
<10-8,Joey>我们认识多久了
<10-8,Joey>How long have we known each other?

273
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:25,380
<10-9,Rachel>七  八...
<10-9,Rachel>Seven, eight...

274
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,880
<10-9,Rachel>八年了
<10-9,Rachel>Eight years. Wow.

275
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:30,040
<10-10,Joey>-真的很久了  -是啊
<10-10,Joey>- A long time. - Yeah.

276
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:34,290
<10-12,Joey>但过去几星期以来我...
<10-12,Joey>But over the past few weeks, I...

277
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:38,820
<10-13,Waiter>好吧  抱歉让你们久等  今天客人真的很多
<10-13,Waiter>Okay! Sorry about the wait, but it is mega-jammed in here.

278
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,290
<10-13,Waiter>今晚的特餐是...
<10-13,Waiter>We have a couple specials tonight...

279
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:43,330
<10-14,Joey>-你能等一下再来吗  -好吧
<10-14,Joey>- Actually could you give us a second? - Sure.

280
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:45,230
<10-14,Joey>时间到
<10-14,Joey>Second's up!

281
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,300
<10-15,Waiter>你们不是那种能开玩笑的客人
<10-15,Waiter>Not that kind of table.

282
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:56,650
<10-16,Rachel>你要说什么
<10-16,Rachel>So you were saying?

283
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,090
<10-17,Joey>我不确定
<10-17,Joey>I'm not quite sure.

284
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,930
<10-17,Joey>你问我们认识了多久
<10-17,Joey>Okay. You asked how long we knew each other,

285
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:05,200
<10-18,Rachel>我说八年
<10-18,Rachel>and I said eight years.

286
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:09,490
<10-18,Rachel>后来服务生走过来  害他损失了一半的小费
<10-18,Rachel>Then the waiter came over and cut his tip in half...

287
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:12,850
<10-18,Rachel>我们就说到这里了
<10-18,Rachel>...and now here we are.

288
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:15,880
<10-19,Joey>没错
<10-19,Joey>Yeah. Here we are.

289
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:21,840
<10-20,Rachel>我...
<10-20,Rachel>I...

290
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,020
<10-21,Joey>我想我爱上你了
<10-21,Joey>I think I'm falling in love with you.

291
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,710
<10-21,Joey>什么
<10-21,Joey>What?

292
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,200
<10-21,Joey>我爱上你了
<10-21,Joey>I'm falling in love with you.

293
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:47,950
<10-22,Rachel>你在跟谁说话
<10-22,Rachel>Who are you talking to?

294
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:52,600
<10-22,Rachel>你在开玩笑  这是闹着玩的
<10-22,Rachel>Oh, you're kidding. It's a joke.

295
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:56,070
<10-22,Rachel>真的很好笑
<10-22,Rachel>Funny. It's funny!

296
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:57,600
<10-22,Rachel>我没找到笑点
<10-22,Rachel>I don't get it.

297
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,660
<10-22,Rachel>好吧
<10-22,Rachel>Okay.

298
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,250
<10-22,Rachel>你...
<10-22,Rachel>Are you...?

299
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,260
<10-22,Rachel>怎么会...
<10-22,Rachel>How did...?

300
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:26,560
<10-22,Rachel>什么时候
<10-22,Rachel>When?

301
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:30,690
<10-23,Joey>那真的重要吗
<10-23,Joey>Does it really matter?

302
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,890
<10-24,Rachel>这里确实好热
<10-24,Rachel>It is hot in here.

303
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,570
<10-25,Joey>我知道这很难接受
<10-25,Joey>Rach, I know this is a lot.

304
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:42,640
<10-25,Joey>你什么都不必说
<10-25,Joey>You don't have to say anything.

305
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:47,170
<10-25,Joey>你要花多少时间思考都可以
<10-25,Joey>You take as much time as you need.

306
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,980
<10-25,Joey>好吧  你得说句话
<10-25,Joey>Okay, you gotta say something.

307
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:02,370
<10-26,Rachel>乔伊  我非常爱你
<10-26,Rachel>Joey, Joey, I love you so much.

308
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:05,250
<10-27,Joey>-但是...  -但是
<10-27,Joey>- But... - But.

309
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,290
<10-28,Rachel>乔伊
<10-28,Rachel>Joey?

310
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:10,150
<10-28,Rachel>对  那...
<10-28,Rachel>Right. Hey, that's...

311
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,840
<10-29,Joey>没关系  真的
<10-29,Joey>That's okay. That's fine.

312
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:17,850
<10-29,Joey>我早就料到你会这样
<10-29,Joey>It's pretty much what I was expecting.

313
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:22,500
<10-29,Joey>那没什么大不了的  好吗
<10-29,Joey>So it's no big deal, all right?

314
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,810
<10-29,Joey>我觉得我该走了
<10-29,Joey>I think I'm gonna go.

315
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:29,440
<10-30,Rachel>乔伊  请不要这样离开
<10-30,Rachel>No, Joey. Please don't leave like this.

316
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,250
<10-30,Rachel>你不能这样对一个孕妇
<10-30,Rachel>You can't do this to a pregnant woman!

317
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,850
<10-31,Joey>别哭了
<10-31,Joey>Don't start doing that.

318
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:38,650
<10-31,Joey>你不能那么做  瑞秋  你都要把我弄哭了
<10-31,Joey>You can't do that, Rach, because you're gonna make me...

319
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:41,500
<10-31,Joey>我们一起哭吧
<10-31,Joey>Oh, there we go!

320
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:46,930
<10-32,Rachel>-可以吗  -没问题
<10-32,Rachel>- Can I? - Sure.

321
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,750
<10-34,Rachel>乔伊  我不想失去...
<10-34,Rachel>Oh, Joey. I don't want to lose...

322
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,080
<10-35,Joey>不会的  好吗  永远不会
<10-35,Joey>You can't, okay? Ever.

323
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:03,580
<10-36,Rachel>-我真的很抱歉  -别这样  瑞秋
<10-36,Rachel>- I'm so sorry. - No, no, no, Rach.

324
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:06,010
<10-37,Joey>请你不要那么说
<10-37,Joey>Please don't be sorry.

325
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:08,920
<10-37,Joey>好吧  别感到抱歉
<10-37,Joey>Okay? Don't be sorry.

326
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,510
<10-37,Joey>我只是在开玩笑
<10-37,Joey>You know, I was only kidding.

327
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:23,460
<10-38,Rachel>对  这个笑话很搞笑
<10-38,Rachel>Yeah, that was a real good one.

328
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,330
<10-38,Rachel>-他们是你的客人  -对
<10-38,Rachel>- Is this your table? - Yeah.

329
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:39,000
<11-1,Waiter>-你得在这里待上一整晚了  -我知道
<11-1,Waiter>- God, you'll be here all night. - I know.

330
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:41,590
<11-2,Waiter>我连特餐内容都还没有介绍
<11-2,Waiter>I haven't even read them the specials yet.

331
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,000
<11-2,Waiter>他们怎么了
<11-2,Waiter>What's the matter with them?

332
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:47,840
<11-3,Waiter>我不知道  可能他们有人快死了
<11-3,Waiter>I don't know. I think maybe one of them is dying.

333
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:53,250
<11-3,Waiter>我希望是那个女的
<11-3,Waiter>I kind of hope it's the girl.

334
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:57,580
<11-3,Waiter>那个男的真的很帅
<11-3,Waiter>The guy is really cute!
