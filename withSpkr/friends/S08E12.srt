<2-12,Joey>你真的很会拖延性爱的进度
<2-12,Joey>You sure are naming a lot of ways to postpone sex.

49
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:34,940
<2-13,Rachel>我怀念约会的感觉  可以盛装打扮
<2-13,Rachel>I miss dating. Getting all dressed up

50
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,900
<2-13,Rachel>去高级餐厅吃饭

00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:39,710
<2-13,Rachel>我很久都没法再出去约会了
<2-13,Rachel>I won't be able to do that for so long.

52
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:41,800
<2-13,Rachel>那真的很有趣
<2-13,Rachel>And it's so much fun.

53
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:43,480
<2-13,Rachel>其实坐在这里
<2-13,Rachel>Not that sitting at home worrying about

54
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,250
<2-13,Rachel>担心生孩子的事也挺有意思
<2-13,Rachel>giving birth to a sixteen pound baby is not fun.

55
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,940
<2-16,Joey>这样吧  我带你出去约会
<2-16,Joey>Hey, you know what? Why don't I take you out.

65
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,780
<3-2,Monica>好吧  轮到我了
<3-2,Monica>Okay, I'm next.

<3-2,Monica>别再开始新一盘了  轮到我了  菲比
<3-2,Monica>Don't start another game. I'm next! Phoebe?

67
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,300
<3-3,Phoebe>抱歉  我赢得太开心  听不到你说话
<3-3,Phoebe>Sorry, I couldn't hear you over all the winning.

68
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,810
<3-4,Monica>菲比在霸占游戏机
<3-4,Monica>Chandler, Phoebe's hogging the game.

69
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,440
<3-5,Chandler>至于吗  不过是个愚蠢的游戏
<3-5,Chandler>Who cares? It's a stupid game.

70
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,390
<3-6,Monica>你觉得它蠢是因为你玩得太逊
<3-6,Monica>You only think it's stupid because you suck at it.

71
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:37,290
<3-7,Chandler>我不逊  是游戏太逊
<3-7,Chandler>I don't suck. It sucks.

72
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,110
<3-7,Chandler>你才逊
<3-7,Chandler>You suck.

73
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,390
<3-8,Phoebe>如果这个游戏
<3-8,Phoebe>Wait okay, if this game

74
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,250
<3-8,Phoebe>会惹得你们俩闹别扭
<3-8,Phoebe>is gonna cause problems between the two of you,

75
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,530
<3-8,Phoebe>那我还是自己留着玩吧
<3-8,Phoebe>then maybe I should just keep it.

76
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:49,210
<3-9,Monica>不  我喜欢它  这个礼物棒极了
<3-9,Monica>No, I love it. It is a great present.

77
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:52,880
<3-9,Monica>你为什么不回家等我给你寄感谢贺卡呢
<3-9,Monica>In fact, why don't you go home and wait for the thank-you card?

78
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,340
<3-10,Chandler>你为什么这么想玩这个游戏
<3-10,Chandler>Why do you want to play this game so badly?

79
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:58,570
<3-11,Phoebe>是啊  又不是每玩完一盘就往外吐糖果
<3-11,Phoebe>Yeah! It's not like it spits out a Clark bar after every game.

80
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:01,430
<3-12,Monica>好吧  菲比  够了  快起来

<4-4,Joey>其实只剩袋子了
<4-4,Joey>Actually, it's just a bag.

93
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,570
<4-4,Joey>从花店走回来真的很远
<4-4,Joey>It's a long walk from the flower shop

94
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:50,260
<4-4,Joey>我饿得头晕  所以...
<4-4,Joey>and I felt faint, so...

95

<4-5,Rachel>这里
<4-5,Rachel>...there.

99
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,400
<4-6,Joey>少来了  这就是真正的约会
<4-6,Joey>Hey, come on. This is a real date.

104
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:23,050
<4-8,Joey>我想见见他  他似乎是个好男人
<4-8,Joey>I'd like to meet him. He sounds like a standup guy.

105
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,660
<4-9,Rachel>但他对我的保护欲很强  你最好小心一点
<4-9,Rachel>But he's protective of me, so you'd better watch yourself.

106
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,640
<4-10,Joey>你室友很帅吗
<4-10,Joey>So this roommate of yours, is he good-looking?

107
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,490
<4-12,Joey>你一定要很努力才能控制自己不爱上他
<4-12,Joey>Must be tough to keep your hands off him.

108
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:38,940
<4-13,Rachel>我很确定他是男同志
<4-13,Rachel>I'm pretty sure he's gay.

00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:42,950
<4-14,Joey>他才不是呢  你为什么要破坏这个游戏
<4-14,Joey>No! No, he's not! Why are you trying to ruin the game?

110
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:44,280
<4-14,Joey>别这样嘛
<4-14,Joey>Come on.

111
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:49,700
<5-1,Ross>这就又回到了葛瑞利的骨牌理论
<5-1,Ross>Which brings us back, of course, to Greely's Theory of Dominance.

<7-1,Rachel>除了蔬菜...
<7-1,Rachel>Instead of the vegetables...

129
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:05,540
<7-2,Waitress>我可以用什么菜品搭配
<7-2,Waitress>...is there any way that I could substitute the...

130
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,010
<7-3,Rachel>三磅龙虾行吗

<7-5,Rachel>感觉这次约会很成功
<7-5,Rachel>Wow, this is shaping up to be a pretty good date.

134
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,040
<7-5,Rachel>我差点忘了  我没付你房租
<7-5,Rachel>I almost forgot. I didn't pay you the rent check.

135
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:25,000
<7-6,Joey>别当我们是室友  我们在约会
<7-6,Joey>No roommate stuff, okay? We're on a date.

136
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,670
<7-7,Rachel>我就要知道乔伊·崔比安尼是怎么跟人约会的了
<7-7,Rachel>Okay. Wow, so I get to see what Joey Tribbiani is like on a date.

137
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:31,400
<7-7,Rachel>你有什么招数吗
<7-7,Rachel>Do you have any moves?

138
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,200
<7-8,Joey>不  我只会做我自己

<7-9,Rachel>All right.

143
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:51,090
<7-10,Joey>约会一开始  我会假装有影迷
<7-10,Joey>I usually start by having a bottle of wine

144
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:53,160
<7-10,Joey>送红酒给我
<7-10,Joey>sent to my table from a fan.

145
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:57,010
<7-11,Rachel>天啊  这招管用吗
<7-11,Rachel>Oh, my God. And that works?

146
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,750
<7-12,Joey>你得加上一句"真是太不好意思了
<7-12,Joey>Well, it does when you combine it with, "This is so embarrassing,

147
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,050
<7-12,Joey>我只想过正常人的生活"
<7-12,Joey>I just want to have a normal life!"

148
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,950
<7-13,Rachel>你们这些可怜的名人
<7-13,Rachel>You poor little famous man.

<7-14,Joey>好吧  听听这招
<7-14,Joey>Okay, how about this one?

150
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,650
<7-14,Joey>我本来想等到送你回家再吻你...
<7-14,Joey>I was gonna wait until the end of the night to kiss you...

151
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,820
<7-14,Joey>但你真的太美了  我实在难以自持
<7-14,Joey>...but you're just so beautiful, I don't think I can.

152
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,800
<7-14,Joey>天啊
<7-14,Joey>Oh, my God!

153
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:25,100
<7-15,Rachel>这招太绝了  我差点就凑上去了  真的
<7-15,Rachel>Wow, that was fantastic! I almost leaned in. I really almost did.

154
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:27,770
<7-16,Joey>告诉我你用的是什么招数
<7-16,Joey>All right. So tell me one of your moves.

156
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:34,030
<7-17,Rachel>你是在哪里长大的
<7-17,Rachel>So where'd you grow up?

157

<7-18,Joey>瑞秋  还好你长得很美
<7-18,Joey>Boy, Rach, you're lucky you're hot.

159

<7-19,Rachel>-快回答我的问题  -皇后区
<7-19,Rachel>- Come on, just answer the question. - Queens.

160
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,650
<7-21,Rachel>你跟父母亲近吗
<7-21,Rachel>So were you close to your parents?

161
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:50,390
<7-22,Joey>我跟妈妈亲  跟爸爸不太说话
<7-22,Joey>With my mom. Not so much my dad.

162
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:51,220
<7-23,Rachel>为什么
<7-23,Rachel>Why not?

163
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,600
<7-24,Joey>我不知道  感觉我们之间有种隔阂
<7-24,Joey>I don't know. I guess there's just always been this distance.

164
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,110
<7-24,Joey>我们都假装没有  但事实上不然
<7-24,Joey>I mean we both try to pretend it's not there, but it is.

165
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,270
<7-25,Rachel>那一定很辛苦
<7-25,Rachel>It's gotta be rough.

166
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:05,010
<7-26,Joey>对  真的很辛苦  有时候我觉得...
<7-26,Joey>Yeah, it's really tough. Sometimes I think...

167
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,570
<7-26,Joey>太帅了
<7-26,Joey>Nice move!

168
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,010
<7-27,Rachel>"你在哪里长大的 "  这招好简单啊
<7-27,Rachel>"Where'd you grow up?" So simple.

<7-28,Joey>谢谢
<7-28,Joey>Thank you.

170
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,000
<7-29,Rachel>对不起  我要去洗手间
<7-29,Rachel>Now, excuse me. I'm gonna use the restroom.

171
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:24,310
<7-31,Rachel>你在注视我离开的背影
<7-31,Rachel>Now you're watching me walk away.

172
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:26,450
<7-32,Joey>没错  太简单了
<7-32,Joey>Yes, I am! Again, so simple!

173
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:33,370
<8-2,Chandler>你一定不相信今天我做了什么
<8-2,Chandler>You are not gonna believe what I did today.

174
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:35,600
<8-3,Monica>很明显  你没洗澡  也没刮胡子
<8-3,Monica>It clearly wasn't showering or shaving.

175
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:40,030
<8-4,Chandler>我玩了一整天这个游戏  现在我是第一名
<8-4,Chandler>I got good. I played this game all day, and now I rule at it.

176
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,220
<8-4,Chandler>他们应该把它改名为"钱德勒小姐"
<8-4,Chandler>They should change the name to "Ms. Chandler."

177
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,700
<8-4,Chandler>还是不要好了
<8-4,Chandler>Although, I hope they don't.

178
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:49,970
<8-5,Monica>你待在家里玩了一整天"吃豆小姐"
<8-5,Monica>Wait a minute. You stayed home and played Ms. Pac-Man

179
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:52,410
<8-5,Monica>而我在外面像牛一样工作
<8-5,Monica>while I went to work like a chump?

180
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:56,310
<8-6,Chandler>我包办了前十名  把菲比挤下了排行榜
<8-6,Chandler>I got all the top 10 scores. I erased Phoebe off the board.

181
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:57,650
<8-6,Chandler>击掌庆祝一下吧
<8-6,Chandler>High-five!

182
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:01,190
<8-7,Monica>你的手是怎么了
<8-7,Monica>What is the matter with your hand?

183
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,260
<8-8,Chandler>我打了八小时的电动
<8-8,Chandler>I've been playing it for like eight hours,

184
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:09,830
<8-8,Chandler>会放松下来的  看看我的比分记录
<8-8,Chandler>It'll loosen up. Come on. Check out the scores.

185
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:13,120
<8-8,Chandler>再看看我编的名字  全是脏话
<8-8,Chandler>Also, look at the initials. They're dirty words.

186
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,900
<8-9,Monica>钱德勒  你为什么要那么做
<8-9,Monica>Chandler, why would you do that?

187
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,500
<8-10,Chandler>因为这样很帅气
<8-10,Chandler>Because it's awesome.

188
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:19,980
<8-11,Monica>你觉得那么做很聪明吗
<8-11,Monica>You think it's clever?

189
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,550
<8-12,Chandler>我只能写下三个字母
<8-12,Chandler>They only give you three letters,

190
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:25,010
<8-12,Chandler>除了ASS[屁股]外  其它名字很难想
<8-12,Chandler>so after A-S-S, it is a challenge.

191
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,070
<8-13,Monica>这不是脏话
<8-13,Monica>This one's not dirty.

192
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:30,610
<8-14,Chandler>把它跟那个连在一起就是了
<8-14,Chandler>It is when you put it together with that one.

193
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,980
<8-15,Monica>如果你不办法把它清掉
<8-15,Monica>If you don't clear this off,

194
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:36,040
<8-15,Monica>以后就别想从我这里尝到那种甜头
<8-15,Monica>you won't get one of those from me.

195
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:40,230
<8-15,Monica>本明天会过来玩游戏  不能让他看到这个
<8-15,Monica>Ben's coming over tomorrow to play this game. This can't be there.

196
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:42,240
<8-16,Chandler>他都不知道这些词是什么意思
<8-16,Chandler>Come on. He won't know what they mean.

197
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,200
<8-17,Monica>钱德勒  他都七岁了  他又不笨
<8-17,Monica>Chandler, he's 7, he's not stupid.

198
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,620
<8-18,Chandler>最近你跟他谈过吗
<8-18,Chandler>Have you talked to him lately?

199
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:48,840
<8-19,Monica>我要把插头拔掉
<8-19,Monica>I'm gonna unplug it.

200
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,390
<8-20,Chandler>别啊  拔掉之后  我今天就等于一无所获
<8-20,Chandler>No-no-no, if you unplug it, I'll have nothing to show for my day!

201
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:52,890
<8-20,Chandler>那和上班又有什么区别
<8-20,Chandler>It would be like I was at work.

202
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,730
<8-20,Chandler>不
<8-20,Chandler>No!

203
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:58,160
<8-20,Chandler>你看  记录还在
<8-20,Chandler>Hey, look! It's still there!

204
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,740
<8-20,Chandler>这玩意一定是用的原始记忆晶片
<8-20,Chandler>This thing must have some kind of primitive ROM chip or something!

205
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,380
<8-21,Monica>你得打败自己的成绩
<8-21,Monica>Honey, you gotta beat your scores.

206
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,040
<8-22,Chandler>我的手指都张不开了
<8-22,Chandler>With the claw?

<8-23,Monica>好吧  让我来  我得把这些词消掉
<8-23,Monica>Fine, I'll do it. I've just got to get this off the screen.

208
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:12,370
<8-23,Monica>卡罗尔还在气你教他"拉我的手指"
<8-23,Monica>Carol's still upset that you taught him "Pull my finger."

210
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,510
<8-24,Chandler>拉我的手指  我的手都毁了
<8-24,Chandler>Pull my finger. My hand is messed up!

226
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:05,270
<9-11,Rachel>那是因为你没有跟我约会过
<9-11,Rachel>That's because you have never been on a date with me before.

<9-21,Rachel>No, I don't want to tell you.

243
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:06,090
<9-23,Rachel>-为什么  -那太丢脸了
<9-23,Rachel>- Why not? - Because it's embarrassing.

244
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:08,840
<9-24,Joey>比涂黑莓口味的护唇膏还丢脸
<9-24,Joey>More embarrassing than shiny raspberry lip balm?

245
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,780
<9-24,Joey>我刚刚没说黑莓口味吧
<9-24,Joey>I didn't say raspberry before, did I?

246
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,170
<9-24,Joey>快告诉我  瑞秋
<9-24,Joey>Just tell me, Rach. Just tell me.

247
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:18,520
<9-24,Joey>好吧
<9-24,Joey>Okay.

248
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:20,130
<9-25,Rachel>站起来
<9-25,Rachel>All right, stand up.

249
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:25,050
<9-25,Rachel>我们走到门口时...
<9-25,Rachel>Well, when we're at the door...

250
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:30,090
<9-25,Rachel>我会将我的嘴唇轻轻压在他的嘴唇上
<9-25,Rachel>...I lightly press my lips against his.

251
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,520
<9-25,Rachel>将身体靠向他  停留一秒钟
<9-25,Rachel>Then move into his body, just for a second.

252
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,270
<9-25,Rachel>然后我会发出这样的声音
<9-25,Rachel>And then I make this sound:

253
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,470
<9-25,Rachel>听起来没什么  但很有效
<9-25,Rachel>It doesn't sound like anything, but I swear it works.

254
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:49,300
<9-26,Joey>对  的确有效
<9-26,Joey>Oh, yeah. That would work, yeah.

255
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:54,590
<9-27,Rachel>好吧  我得睡了 我今晚玩得很开心
<9-27,Rachel>All right, I gotta go to bed. Honey. I had such a wonderful time.

256
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:02,810
<9-27,Rachel>我也是
<9-27,Rachel>Me too.

257
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,710
<10-1,Rachel>你上课迟到了50分钟  你是用爬的吗
<10-1,Rachel>You were 50 minutes late to the class, what did you crawl there?

258
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:20,540
<10-2,Ross>不  我用跑的  真的很远
<10-2,Ross>No, I ran, okay? It's really far.

259
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,170
<10-2,Ross>现在的人怎么都听不懂
<10-2,Ross>When did people stop understanding

260
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:24,630
<10-2,Ross>"别挡我的路"呢
<10-2,Ross>the phrase "Get the hell out of my way"?

261
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:27,560
<10-3,Rachel>你为什么不搭计程车
<10-3,Rachel>Why didn't you take a cab?

262
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,980
<10-4,Ross>塞车太严重  还净是单行道
<10-4,Ross>Between the traffic that time of day and all the one-way streets

263
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,830
<10-4,Ross>搭计程车得花两倍的时间
<10-4,Ross>it'd take me twice as long.

264
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,860
<10-4,Ross>再说  我一星期有三堂课
<10-4,Ross>Besides, I teach the class three times a week.

265
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,730
<10-4,Ross>你以为我是富家子弟吗
<10-4,Ross>Who am I, Rockefeller?

266
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,830
<10-5,Rachel>你不能再继续这样下去了
<10-5,Rachel>You won't be able to keep doing this.

267
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:44,400
<10-6,Ross>没办法  不然他们会取消我这堂课
<10-6,Ross>I have to. If I don't, they'll take the class away from me.

268
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,270
<10-6,Ross>我已经把这条新闻登在我家的通讯报上了
<10-6,Ross>And I put it in my family newsletter.

269
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:52,670
<10-8,Ross>-什么  -你看过的  《盖勒通讯报》
<10-8,Ross>- Your what? - You've seen it, The Geller Yeller.

270
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:56,610
<10-9,Rachel>对
<10-9,Rachel>Right. Wow.

271
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,910
<10-10,Ross>我想出一条比较快的路线
<10-10,Ross>I think I figured out a much faster route.

272
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,760
<10-10,Ross>我敢说这次我能及时赶到
<10-10,Ross>I'm sure I can make it this time.

273
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:06,890
<10-10,Ross>只是我不能害怕被车子撞到
<10-10,Ross>I just can't be afraid to get a little bit hit by cars.

274
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,240
<10-12,Rachel>还记得昨晚我们谈过《狂犬惊魂记》吗
<10-12,Rachel>Remember last night when we talked about Cujo?

275
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,430
<10-13,Joey>我不敢相信你没看过《狂犬惊魂记》
<10-13,Joey>Yeah, I still can't believe you haven't seen Cujo.

276
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:18,560
<10-13,Joey>真搞不懂你
<10-13,Joey>What is wrong with you?

277
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,850
<10-14,Rachel>至于吗  那又不是《公民凯恩》
<10-14,Rachel>Relax, it's not like it's Citizen Kane.

278
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:23,150
<10-15,Joey>你看完了《公民凯恩》
<10-15,Joey>Have you ever sat through Citizen Kane?

279
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,290
<10-16,Rachel>是啊  真的很无聊  但那可是经典
<10-16,Rachel>Yeah, it's really boring. But it's, like, a big deal.

280
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:32,060
<10-16,Rachel>总之  我想去租《狂犬惊魂记》
<10-16,Rachel>Anyway, I was thinking about renting Cujo sometime.

281
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:34,770
<10-17,Joey>我们今晚一起看吧
<10-17,Joey>Yeah, all right. Well, let's do it tonight.

282
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:38,190
<10-18,Rachel>-你不是有约会吗  -对
<10-18,Rachel>- Don't you have that big date tonight? - Oh, right.

283
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:41,410
<10-20,Rachel>-乔伊  我能问你一件事吗  -问吧
<10-20,Rachel>- Hey, Joey, can I ask you something? - Yeah.

284
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:45,510
<10-21,Joey>昨晚约会后  你有没有觉得怪怪的
<10-21,Joey>After our date last night, did you feel a little weird?

285
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,400
<10-23,Joey>天啊  你也是吗
<10-23,Joey>Oh, my God. You did too?

286
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:49,910
<10-23,Joey>我吓坏了  那是怎么回事
<10-23,Joey>It totally freaked me out. What was that?

287
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,510
<10-23,Joey>我不知道
<10-23,Joey>I don't know.

288
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:55,790
<10-24,Rachel>我觉得应该是龙虾的问题
<10-24,Rachel>I'm kind of thinking it was the lobster.

289
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,850
<10-25,Joey>对啊  龙虾
<10-25,Joey>Oh, yeah. Yeah, the lobster.

290
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:05,550
<10-26,Rachel>-我吐了一整晚  -我也是
<10-26,Rachel>- I was up sick all night. - Me too. All night.

291
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:08,040
<10-28,Rachel>真的吗  那我怎么没看到你
<10-28,Rachel>Really? How come we didn't cross paths?

292
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,020
<10-29,Joey>对  那是因为
<10-29,Joey>Yeah, well, that's because...

293
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,210
<10-29,Joey>我都待在房里
<10-29,Joey>...I stayed in my room.

294
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:16,940
<10-29,Joey>我的洗衣篮惨不忍睹
<10-29,Joey>You don't want to look in my hamper.

295
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:24,110
<11-1,Monica>好了  吃掉那个
<11-1,Monica>Okay, I got that.

296
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:27,380
<11-1,Monica>躲过那里  然后再回来
<11-1,Monica>I'll escape there. I'll come back here.

297
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,230
<11-1,Monica>好了  加油  吃豆小姐
<11-1,Monica>All right. Come on, Ms. Pac-Man.

298
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:34,640
<11-1,Monica>你就是个小贱人  对吧
<11-1,Monica>Well, you're just a little bitch, aren't you?!

299
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:39,500
<11-2,Phoebe>大家好
<11-2,Phoebe>Hey, you guys?

300
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:43,550
<11-2,Phoebe>抱歉之前我霸占着电动玩具
<11-2,Phoebe>I'm sorry that I was hogging the game before.

301
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:45,120
<11-2,Phoebe>天啊
<11-2,Phoebe>Oh, my God!

302
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:48,890
<11-2,Phoebe>你朋友名字的缩写真难听
<11-2,Phoebe>Your friends have some unfortunate initials.

303
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,620
<11-3,Monica>那都是钱德勒干的
<11-3,Monica>They're all Chandler.

304
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:54,440
<11-4,Phoebe>钱德勒不可能有这么厉害
<11-4,Phoebe>Chandler sucks. He couldn't get this good.

305
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,970
<11-5,Chandler>我很厉害  但那是要付出代价的
<11-5,Chandler>I did. But it came at a price.

306
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:02,720
<11-6,Monica>本今晚要过来  不能让他看到这些
<11-6,Monica>Ben's coming over tonight, and he can't see this.

307
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,850
<11-7,Chandler>七岁的孩子应该连杂交都看过了吧
<11-7,Chandler>Come on. By age 7, kids have already seen orgies.

308
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:11,130
<11-7,Chandler>还是只有我而己
<11-7,Chandler>Was it just me?

309
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:24,800
<12-1,Ross>我办到了  我及时赶到了
<12-1,Ross>Yes, I made it! I'm on time!

00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:49,050
<12-1,Ross>很多红点
<12-1,Ross>...a bunch of red spots.

<12-1,Ross>请大家先看一会书  我要...
<12-1,Ross>Okay, why don't you all start to read while I...

316
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,530
<12-1,Ross>你没事吗  你似乎有点心不在焉
<12-1,Ross>Are you all right? You seem a little distracted.

317
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:11,970
<12-1,Ross>不  我没事  我只是
<12-1,Ross>No, no, I'm fine. It's just...

318
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:15,440
<12-1,Ross>我能问你一件事吗
<12-1,Ross>Hey, can I ask you something?

319
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,480
<13-1,Joey>你有没有这样的经验  看着你熟悉的人...
<13-1,Joey>Have you ever looked at someone you know for a while

320
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,620
<13-1,Joey>突然间有不一样的感觉
<13-1,Joey>and suddenly seen them in a different way?

321
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,770
<13-2,Joey>你是说从背后看吗
<13-2,Joey>You mean like from behind?

322
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,930
<13-2,Joey>没错  就是那样
<13-2,Joey>Yeah. That's exactly it.

323
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,370
<13-2,Joey>有一次  我从背后看这个家伙
<13-2,Joey>You know what? One time I saw this guy from behind

324
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:37,590
<13-2,Joey>觉得他真的很普通
<13-2,Joey>and he seemed like a totally normal guy

325
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:40,120
<13-2,Joey>他一转身  才发现他是史蒂芬·鲍德温[演员]
<13-2,Joey>And then he turned around and it was Stephen Baldwin!

326
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:43,740
<13-2,Joey>对
<13-2,Joey>Yeah.

327
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,620
<13-3,Joey>你完全了解我的意思
<13-3,Joey>So you know exactly what I'm talking about.

328
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:47,960
<13-3,Joey>没错

332
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:12,120
<14-5,Monica>-别碰我  -别碰她
<14-5,Monica>- Don't touch me! - Don't touch her!

<16-2,Joey>-你一个人  -对  这只狗是怎么了
<16-2,Joey>- Alone? - Yes! What is wrong with this dog?

340
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:59,580
<16-3,Rachel>你看到他们被困在车里
<16-3,Rachel>Did you get to the part where they're trapped in the car

341
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,580
<16-4,Joey>库裘自己去撞车的那一幕了吗
<16-4,Joey>and Cujo's throwing himself at the windshield?

342
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:04,630
<16-5,Rachel>没有  说真的  这只狗有什么毛病
<16-5,Rachel>No, seriously, what's wrong with the dog?

343
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:07,410
<16-5,Rachel>等一下  你怎么这么早就回来了
<16-5,Rachel>Wait a minute, what are you doing home so early?

344
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:08,620
<16-5,Rachel>你不是去约会了吗
<16-5,Rachel>What happened to your date?

345
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:10,790
<16-6,Joey>我们之间不来电
<16-6,Joey>Oh, it didn't work out.

346
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:13,080
<16-7,Rachel>你要跟我一起把电影看完吗
<16-7,Rachel>Do you want to watch the rest of the movie with me?

347
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:16,040
<16-8,Joey>好吧
<16-8,Joey>Oh, okay. Yeah.

348
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,420
<16-9,Rachel>我以前从未对一部电影有这种感觉
<16-9,Rachel>You know, I never thought I'd say this about a movie,

349
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,720
<16-9,Rachel>但我真希望这只狗死掉
<16-9,Rachel>...but I really hope this dog dies.

350
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:26,280
<16-9,Rachel>你坐在那里干嘛  坐在这里保护我
<16-9,Rachel>What are you doing over there? Come sit here, you protect me.
