<14-2,Monica>你真的是不太会帮人记留言嘛
<14-2,Monica>Apparently, you're not very good at it.

259
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:12,140
<14-4,Rachel>但钱德勒  最重要的是  你得原谅自己
<14-4,Rachel>But Chandler, the important thing is that you forgive yourself.

<14-10,Ross>这段感情会破裂是两个人的错
<14-10,Ross>lt took two people to break up this relationship!

<14-16,Ross>Front and back!

278
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:09,570
<14-16,Ross>还有"你得"是指"你必须"
<14-16,Ross>And by the way? Y- O- U, apostrophe R- E means, "you are. "
