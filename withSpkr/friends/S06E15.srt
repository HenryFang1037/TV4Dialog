1
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:04,780
<1-1,Rachel>你们猜怎样
<1-1,Rachel>Hey, you guys, guess what.

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,330
<1-1,Rachel>巴瑞和明蒂要离婚了
<1-1,Rachel>Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce.

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:08,640
<1-2,Monica>天啊
<1-2,Monica>Oh, my God.

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,670
<1-4,Joey>你是怎么搞的
<1-4,Joey>What is the matter with you?

5
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:16,360
<1-5,Phoebe>-不  是巴瑞和明蒂  -抱歉
<1-5,Phoebe>- No. Barry and Mindy. - Oh, sorry.

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,930
<1-6,Joey>我一听到"离婚"  就以为是罗斯
<1-6,Joey>l hear "divorce," l immediately go to Ross.

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,590
<1-5,Phoebe>谁是巴瑞和明蒂
<1-5,Phoebe>Who's Barry and Mindy?

8
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:23,300
<1-7,Rachel>巴瑞是我差点要嫁的人
<1-7,Rachel>Barry was the guy that l almost married,

9
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,290
<1-7,Rachel>明蒂是我最要好的朋友
<1-7,Rachel>and Mindy was my best friend.

10
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:26,810
<1-8,Joey>当初他不就是被你跟她乱搞吗
<1-8,Joey>Wasn't he cheating on you with her?

11
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:27,960
<1-9,Rachel>是啊  但只表示
<1-9,Rachel>But that just means

12
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,650
<1-9,Rachel>他做爱时睡死在她身上  而非我身上
<1-9,Rachel>he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me.

13
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:33,870
<1-10,Monica>天啊  要是我真的嫁给他
<1-10,Monica>God, could you imagine if I actually married him?!

14
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,220
<1-11,Rachel>我的人生会多么不同
<1-11,Rachel>I mean how different would my life be?

15
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:37,200
<1-12,Ross>我懂你的意思
<1-12,Ross>I know what you mean.

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,350
<1-12,Ross>我总是在想
<1-12,Ross>l've always wondered how different my life would be...

17
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:41,120
<1-12,Ross>要是我没有离婚会怎样
<1-12,Ross>...if l'd never gotten divorced.

18
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,060
<1-13,Phoebe>-哪一次  -第一次啦
<1-13,Phoebe>- Which time? - The first time!

19
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:47,890
<1-14,Ross>真的  想象一下要是卡萝没变成同性恋
<1-14,Ross>Seriously, imagine if Carol hadn't realized she was a lesbian.

20
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:52,440
<1-15,Joey>想象不出来  我一直想到女女
<1-15,Joey>l can't. l keep seeing it the good way.

21
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,890
<1-16,Ross>我肯定还在练控手道[空手道]
<1-16,Ross>l bet l'd still be doing my karate.

22
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:00,870
<1-16,Ross>我们婚姻后期  我经常练控手道
<1-16,Ross>Towards the end of our marriage, l did a lot of karate.

23
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:03,940
<1-16,Ross>好宣泄我缺乏...
<1-16,Ross>It's a way of release the tension from...

24
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,380
<1-16,Ross>缺乏某些"肉体"运动的多余精力
<1-16,Ross>... not doing anything else physical.

25
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:09,040
<1-17,Chandler>也许你不念成控手道就没事了
<1-17,Chandler>Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it "ka- ra- tay."

26
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:12,290
<1-18,Monica>如果我还是很胖呢
<1-18,Monica>What if l was still fat?

27
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,260
<1-18,Monica>你一定不会跟我交往
<1-18,Monica>You wouldn't be dating me, that's for sure.

28
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:17,820
<1-19,Chandler>-当然会  -少来了
<1-19,Chandler>- Sure l would. - Come on.

29
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,470
<1-21,Chandler>你们真的觉得我那么肤浅吗
<1-21,Chandler>You guys really think l'm that shallow?

30
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:22,830
<1-22,Ross>不  我只是觉得摩妮卡太胖
<1-22,Ross>No, l just think Monica was that fat.

31
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:27,860
<1-23,Joey>要是我没被《我们的岁月》开除呢
<1-23,Joey>Hey, imagine if l'd never got fired off Days of Our Lives.

32
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,720
<1-23,Joey>卡萝又出现了
<1-23,Joey>Hey. Hey, there's Carol again.

33
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:35,120
<1-24,Chandler>要是我有勇气辞职呢
<1-24,Chandler>What if l had had the guts to quit my job?

34
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,090
<1-24,Chandler>我没准就在帮《纽约客》写稿了
<1-24,Chandler>l'd probably be writing for The New Yorker,

35
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:38,720
<1-24,Chandler>拿钱搞笑
<1-24,Chandler>being paid to be funny.

36
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,160
<1-24,Chandler>现在的工作也很有趣啦
<1-24,Chandler>But my job's fun too. l mean,

37
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:44,130
<1-24,Chandler>明天...  我不必打领带
<1-24,Chandler>tomorrow...l don't have to wear a tie.

38
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,080
<1-25,Phoebe>要是我答应了去美林证券上班呢
<1-25,Phoebe>What if l'd taken that job at Merrill Lynch?

39
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,980
<1-27,Rachel>-什么  -美林证券
<1-27,Rachel>- What? - Merrill Lynch?

40
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:52,080
<1-28,Phoebe>对  我有个客人在那里上班
<1-28,Phoebe>Yeah, l had a massage client who worked there,

41
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,760
<1-28,Phoebe>他说我有炒股票的头脑
<1-28,Phoebe>and he said l had a knack for stocks.

42
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,110
<1-29,Rachel>那你怎么不去
<1-29,Rachel>Why didn't you take the job?

43
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:57,650
<1-30,Phoebe>因为当时我相信
<1-30,Phoebe>Because at that time, you see,

44
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:00,090
<1-30,Phoebe>押韵的事情都会成真
<1-30,Phoebe>l thought that everything that rhymed was true.

45
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,400
<1-30,Phoebe>我觉得要是我去做股票
<1-30,Phoebe>So l thought if l worked with stocks...

46
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,670
<1-30,Phoebe>就得住地窖
<1-30,Phoebe>...l'd have to live in a box

47
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:06,310
<1-30,Phoebe>只能吃安眠药  养三脚猫
<1-30,Phoebe>and only eat lox and have a pet fox.

48
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,380
<1-31,Ross>你们觉得如果人生真的如刚才所说的
<1-31,Ross>Do you guys think if all those things happened,

49
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,430
<1-31,Ross>我们还会在一起吗
<1-31,Ross>we'd still hang out?

61
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:01,000
<2-1,Ross>天啊  瑞秋·格林
<2-1,Ross>Oh, my God. Rachel Green?

<3-2,Monica>He's not boring. He's just....

82
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:14,270
<3-2,Monica>只是比较低调
<3-2,Monica>He's low-key.

<2-12,Rachel>-给  你的榛果拿铁  -谢谢
<2-12,Rachel>- Here you go, one hazelnut latte. - Thank you.

84
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:21,510
<2-13,Ross>其实榛果不是果实
<2-13,Ross>You know, the hazelnut, actually not a nut.

85
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,310
<3-2,Monica>而是种子

87
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,450

<3-9,Chandler>他们说我的东西很有趣
<3-9,Chandler>They said my writing was funny,

92
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,780
<3-9,Chandler>只是不符合《阿奇漫画》风
<3-9,Chandler>just not "Archie Comic" funny.

94
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:47,920
<3-10,Monica>亲爱的  我得回医院了
<3-10,Monica>You know what? Honey, l gotta get back to the hospital.

<3-11,Monica>对了  答案是巴西果
<3-11,Monica>By the way, the answer is: the Brazil nut.

98
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,580
<3-12,Chandler>他的原问题是  "有东西比他还无聊"吗
<3-12,Chandler>Was his question, "what's more boring than him?"

99
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:05,500
<3-13,Joey>老兄  退稿的事真遗憾
<3-13,Joey>Hey, man. Sorry about the Archie thing.

100
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,750
<3-13,Joey>你要我给你点钱吗
<3-13,Joey>You need me to give you some money?

101
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,720
<3-14,Chandler>我穷归穷  但骨气还是有的
<3-14,Chandler>l may have no money, but l still have my pride.

102
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,550
<3-15,Joey>是吗
<3-15,Joey>Really?

103
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,700
<3-16,Chandler>也许乔伊不必给你钱啊
<3-16,Chandler>Maybe Joey doesn't have to give you the money.

104
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,620
<3-17,Monica>-电视明星都有助理对吧   -好主意
<3-17,Monica>- TV stars have assistants, right? - That's an idea.

105
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,680
<3-18,Joey>要是我请助理转交  你会收吗
<3-18,Joey>lf l hire an assistant, would you take money from her?

106
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:29,590
<3-19,Monica>不是啦  钱德勒可以当你的助理
<3-19,Monica>No, Joey. Chandler could be your assistant.

107
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:32,110
<3-19,Monica>他可以帮你回信给影迷
<3-19,Monica>He could answer all your fan mail and stuff.

108
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:34,170
<3-20,Joey>不错  就这么办吧
<3-20,Joey>That would be great! Let's do that!

109
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:36,360
<3-21,Chandler>我有钱领  还有时间写作
<3-21,Chandler>l could use the money. It could give me time to write.

110
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,660
<3-22,Joey>-那就行啦  欢迎加入  -感谢
<3-22,Joey>- All right. Great. Welcome aboard! - Okay!

111

<3-23,Chandler>我现在要去上厕所啦
<3-23,Chandler>All right. Now, l need to use the bathroom.

112
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,950
<3-24,Joey>不过我上厕所不用人帮
<3-24,Joey>Since l don't need any assistance in there,

113
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,960
<3-24,Joey>-助理你就休息吧  -好的
<3-24,Joey>- take a break! - All right.

<3-27,Monica>- Guess what. - What.

116
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:52,110
<3-29,Monica>乔伊找钱德勒当他的助理
<3-29,Monica>Joey just hired Chandler to be his assistant.

117
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:53,980
<3-29,Monica>真好
<3-29,Monica>That's so sweet.

<3-30,Phoebe>50是一个数字  在49后面
<3-30,Phoebe>Five- oh! lt's a number! lt comes after four- nine!
