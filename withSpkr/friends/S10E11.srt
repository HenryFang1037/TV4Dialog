<6-9,Ross>...but we didn't want it

242
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:55,850

<6-9,Ross>to jeopardize our friendship,

243
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,380
<6-9,Ross>所以我们约定

244
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,920
<6-9,Ross>谁也不能跟你约会

<11-1,Ross>听着  艾德丽安
<11-1,Ross>Listen, Adrienne,

413
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,540
<11-1,Ross>你可不能告诉钱德勒这件事
<11-1,Ross>you can't tell Chandler about this.

<11-2,Adrienne>我不会告诉任何人的
<11-2,Adrienne>I won't be telling anybody about this.

416
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:30,720
<11-3,Ross>酷
<11-3,Ross>Cool.

417
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:41,440
<11-3,Ross>我以为你不知道
<11-3,Ross>I didn't know you knew about that.

418
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:44,080
<12-1,Ross>但是我知道了  我还很伤心
<12-1,Ross>Well, I did. And it hurt.

419
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:47,680
<12-2,Chandler>所以我才写了《在休息室被背叛》那首歌
<12-2,Chandler>That's when I wrote the song "Betrayal in the Common Room."

420
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:53,080
<12-3,Ross>嘿  对不起
<12-3,Ross>Man, I'm sorry.

421
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,900
<12-4,Chandler>好了  那都是陈年往事了
<12-4,Chandler>Look, that was a long time ago.

422
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:59,680
<12-5,Ross>那  我跟艾德丽安亲热
<12-5,Ross>So I made out with Adrienne,

423
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:01,340
<12-5,Ross>而你跟米西亲热
<12-5,Ross>and you made out with Missy.

424
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,770
<12-5,Ross>我看我们俩扯平了
<12-5,Ross>Well, I guess we're even.

425
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,500
<12-7,Ross>我们俩扯平了  对吧
<12-7,Ross>We are even, right?

426
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:14,920
<12-8,Chandler>还有一件事
<12-8,Chandler>One more thing.

427
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:16,490
<12-8,Chandler>那晚我特生你的气
<12-8,Chandler>I was so pissed at you that night,

428
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,670
<12-8,Chandler>想报复你
<12-8,Chandler>I wanted to get back at you.

429
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,860
<12-8,Chandler>所以我当时想
<12-8,Chandler>So I thought,

430
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:21,050
<12-8,Chandler>"谁是罗斯最喜欢的人呢"
<12-8,Chandler>"Who does Ross like more than anybody?"

431
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,500
<12-9,Ross>你对我妈做了什么
<12-9,Ross>What did you do to my mom?

432
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,800
<12-10,Chandler>不是她
<12-10,Chandler>Not her.

433
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,790
<13-1,Rachel>我可真醉了
<13-1,Rachel>I am so drunk.

434
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,000
<13-2,Monica>那就怪了
<13-2,Monica>That's weird.

435
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:53,800
<13-2,Monica>我跟你喝的差不多
<13-2,Monica>I've had the same number of beers as you

436
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:55,540
<13-2,Monica>怎么我一点没感觉
<13-2,Monica>and don't feel anything.

437
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,030
<13-3,Chandler>你俩玩儿得愉快吗
<13-3,Chandler>So you girls having fun?

00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,360
<13-4,Monica>我瘦了4磅
<13-4,Monica>...I've lost four pounds.

440
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,540
<13-4,Monica>没准儿跳完舞会瘦到5磅
<13-4,Monica>Maybe even five with all the dancing.

441
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:09,960
<13-5,Pizza guy>-有人定比萨饼了吗   -哦  是我
<13-5,Pizza guy>- Somebody order a pizza? - Oh, that's me!

442
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:16,810
<13-7,Rachel>我明天的入学考试算是没戏了
<13-7,Rachel>I am so not gonna do good on my SATs tomorrow.

443
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:20,470
<13-8,Chandler>那  明年也许你可以到我们这儿来上大学
<13-8,Chandler>Well, maybe you could go to school here next year

444
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,990
<13-8,Chandler>我们可以一块玩玩
<13-8,Chandler>and we could totally hang out.

00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,160
<13-9,Rachel>哦  对  好主意
<13-9,Rachel>Oh, yeah. There's a plan.

<13-9,Rachel>那我干脆现在就吃点脑灵通得了
<13-9,Rachel>Why don't I just start taking my smart pills now.

447
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,480
<13-10,Chandler>没准儿你能拿到选美奖学金呢
<13-10,Chandler>Well, maybe you could get in on a beauty scholarship.

448
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,280
<13-11,Rachel>别骗人了
<13-11,Rachel>What a line.

00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,590
<13-12,Chandler>-那  你都申请了哪些学校   -唔..
<13-12,Chandler>- So where are you applying to? - Well...

00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,690
<13-13,Rachel>你知道  我觉着我要去的地方应该阳光明媚
<13-13,Rachel>You know,l think it's kind of really important

451
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,990
<13-13,Rachel>这很重要  所以我想…
<13-13,Rachel>that I go somewhere where there's sun.

452
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,600
<13-13,Rachel>所以我想...嗨

462
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:15,600
<14-3,Roy>早几年我就该挂起那逃脱三角绷带  不干了
<14-3,Roy>I should have hung up that breakaway jockstrap years ago.

463
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,640
<14-3,Roy>现在我该怎么办
<14-3,Roy>What am I gonna do? I mean...

<14-3,Roy>我是说  我干这个都32年了
<14-3,Roy>...this has been my life for 32 years.

465
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:27,390
<14-3,Roy>我只会在人家面前脱衣服
<14-3,Roy>Taking my clothes off in front of people is all I know.

466
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:31,180
<14-4,Rachel>不  等等  一定还有别的事你能做的
<14-4,Rachel>No, wait, there's got to be something else that you can do.

<14-5,Roy>I can make my pecs dance.

470
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:46,950
<14-5,Roy>我可以用屁股蛋儿夹起1美元
<14-5,Roy>I can pick up a dollar bill with my butt cheeks.

471
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:51,140
<14-5,Roy>而在我的内心深处
<14-5,Roy>I can go to that special place inside me

472
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:53,350
<14-5,Roy>并无羞愧之意
<14-5,Roy>where I feel no shame.

473
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:57,500
<14-6,Rachel>那你也许可以从政

00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,270
<14-8,Roy>我想我妈不会介意的
<14-8,Roy>I don't think my mom would mind.
