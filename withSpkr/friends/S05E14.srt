1
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:07,480
<1-1,Phoebe>你们看  丑裸男在收拾东西
<1-1,Phoebe>Oh hey, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy is putting stuff in boxes!

2
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,650
<1-2,Rachel>看样子我们的裸友要搬家了
<1-2,Rachel>I'd say from the looks of it; our naked buddy is moving.

3
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:14,870
<1-3,Ross>讽刺的是
<1-3,Ross>Ironically,

4
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:17,610
<1-3,Ross>大部分的箱子都标示着"衣服"
<1-3,Ross>most of the boxes seem to be labeled clothes.

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,830
<1-4,Rachel>我会怀念那个软软的大屁股的
<1-4,Rachel>Ohh, I'm gonna miss that big old squishy butt.

6
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,020
<1-5,Chandler>鸡肉炒饭吃不下去了
<1-5,Chandler>And we're done with the chicken fried rice.

7
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:29,330
<1-6,Ross>如果他要搬走  我可以去把那里租下来
<1-6,Ross>Hey! Hey! If he's moving, maybe I should try to get his place!

8
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:30,480
<1-7,All>好主意
<1-7,All>Good idea!

9
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,140
<1-8,Ross>跟你们遥遥相对多好玩啊
<1-8,Ross>It would be so cool to live across from you guys!

10
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:35,290
<1-9,Joey>那我们就可以玩电话游戏
<1-9,Joey>Hey, yeah! Then we could do that telephone thing!

11
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:36,610
<1-9,Joey>你一个罐子
<1-9,Joey>Y'know, you have a can,

12
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,110
<1-9,Joey>我们一个罐子  中间有一条线
<1-9,Joey>we have a can and it's connected by a string!

13
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:44,560
<1-10,Chandler>或者我们也可以打真的电话
<1-10,Chandler>Or we can do the actual telephone thing.

29
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,540
<2-1,Ross>天哪  我爱死这间公寓了  很完美吧
<2-1,Ross>Oh my God! I love this apartment! Isn't it perfect?!

30
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:41,930
<2-1,Ross>我居然没发现这里有这么棒
<2-1,Ross>I can't believe I never realized how great it is!

31
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:45,380
<2-2,Rachel>因为你的目光会马上移到大块头裸男身上
<2-2,Rachel>Well that is because your eye immediately goes to the big naked man.

32
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:48,550
<2-3,Phoebe>太棒了  你最好赶快
<2-3,Phoebe>It's amazing! You better hurry up

33
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,100
<2-3,Phoebe>去申请  否则我会抢先
<2-3,Phoebe>and fill out an application or I'm gonna beat you to it.

34
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,650
<2-5,Rachel>没想到会有这一天
<2-5,Rachel>Well, I never thought I'd say this,

35
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,040
<2-5,Rachel>我要去用丑裸男的厕所了
<2-5,Rachel>but I'm gonna go use Ugly Naked Guy's bathroom.

<3-7,Rachel>菲比发现了莫妮卡和钱德勒的事
<3-7,Rachel>Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.

65
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,350
<3-8,Joey>就是他们是朋友  如此而已吗
<3-8,Joey>You mean how they're friends and nothing more?

66
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,680
<3-9,Rachel>不  乔伊  她知道了
<3-9,Rachel>No. Joey, she knows!

67
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,080
<3-9,Rachel>我们刚才在丑裸男的公寓
<3-9,Rachel>We were at Ugly Naked Guy's apartment

68
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,620
<3-9,Rachel>看到他们隔着窗户在做
<3-9,Rachel>and we saw them doing it through the window.

69
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:44,870
<3-9,Rachel>应该说是靠着窗户在做
<3-9,Rachel>Actually, we saw them doing it up against the window.

70
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:48,020
<3-10,Phoebe>所以说  他们知道你知道
<3-10,Phoebe>Okay, so now they know that you know

71
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,710
<3-10,Phoebe>但是不知道瑞秋知道吗
<3-10,Phoebe>and they don't know that Rachel knows?

72
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,080
<3-11,Joey>对  知道吗
<3-11,Joey>Yes, but y'know what?

73
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:53,650
<3-11,Joey>谁知道什么都不重要了
<3-11,Joey>It doesn't matter who knows what.

74
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,010
<3-11,Joey>我们三个人都知道了  就可以告诉他们了
<3-11,Joey>Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know!

75
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:00,220
<3-11,Joey>我再也不必说谎保密了
<3-11,Joey>Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!

76
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:03,880
<3-12,Phoebe>或者也可以不告诉他们  咱们来找点乐子
<3-12,Phoebe>Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own.

77
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:07,030
<3-13,Rachel>什么意思
<3-13,Rachel>Wh-what do you mean?

78
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:09,270
<3-14,Phoebe>譬如每次他们说要洗衣服
<3-14,Phoebe>Well y'know every time that they say that like they're doing laundry

79
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,500
<3-14,Phoebe>我们就给他们一堆衣服洗
<3-14,Phoebe>we'll just give them a bunch of laundry to do.

00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,260
<3-16,Joey>你知道怎样更好玩吗  告诉他们
<3-16,Joey>you know what would even be more fun? Telling them.

83
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,720
<3-17,Rachel>不  我想照菲比说的做
<3-17,Rachel>Ehhh, no, I wanna do Phoebe's thing.

<3-19,Phoebe>No! You don't have to do anything! Just don't tell them that we know!

86
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,890
<3-20,Joey>不要  我没办法再保密了
<3-20,Joey>Noo! I can't take any more secrets!

00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,090
<3-20,Joey>还有我自己的秘密
<3-20,Joey>I got secrets of my own y'know!

89
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,680
<3-21,Rachel>你才没有秘密
<3-21,Rachel>You don't have any secrets!

123
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:44,250
<4-6,Chandler>我觉得菲比在钓我
<4-6,Chandler>I think Phoebe was hitting on me.

124
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:46,820
<4-7,Monica>你在说什么
<4-7,Monica>What are you talking about?

125
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:49,620
<4-8,Chandler>是真的  菲比觉得我很有魅力
<4-8,Chandler>I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.

126
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:54,280
<4-9,Monica>不可能
<4-9,Monica>That's not possible!

127
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,500
<4-10,Chandler>抱歉  只是在菲比眼中
<4-10,Chandler>I'm sorry it's just, Phoebe just always thought you were,

128
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:04,420
<4-11,Monica>你的魅力是没有男性吸引力的
<4-11,Monica>you were charming in a, in a sexless kind of way.

129
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:06,950
<4-12,Chandler>这种话真是百听不厌
<4-12,Chandler>Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough.

130
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,860
<4-13,Monica>抱歉  你应该误解她的意思了
<4-13,Monica>I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her.

131
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,540
<4-14,Chandler>我没有误解  好吗
<4-14,Chandler>No, I didn't misunderstand, okay?

132
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:16,480
<4-14,Chandler>她对我上下其手  她还摸我的二头肌呢
<4-14,Chandler>She was all over me! She touched my bicep for crying out loud!

133
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:18,340
<4-15,Monica>这个二头肌
<4-15,Monica>This bicep?

134
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:20,820
<4-16,Chandler>我现在没挤它好吧
<4-16,Chandler>Well it's not flexed right now!

<5-8,Monica>我的硬币应该不够
<5-8,Monica>I mean I-I don't I think I have enough quarters.

<5-9,Phoebe>我这里有
<5-9,Phoebe>I have quarters!

145
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:04,600
<5-11,Rachel>罗斯  公寓申请得怎样
<5-11,Rachel>Hey Ross! Any word on the apartment yet?

146
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,570
<5-12,Ross>我打过去问  原来
<5-12,Ross>Well, I called over there and it turns out

147
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,910
<5-12,Ross>丑裸男要自己转租
<5-12,Ross>Ugly Naked Guy is subletting it himself

148
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,940
<5-12,Ross>而且已经有一大堆申请者了
<5-12,Ross>and he's already had like a hundred applicants.

149
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,940
<5-14,Ross>我占了优势
<5-14,Ross>I've got the edge.

150
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:16,250
<5-14,Ross>我知道这样有点奸诈  但我送了点东西
<5-14,Ross>I know it's not exactly ethical but I sent him a little bribe to

151
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,560
<5-14,Ross>去贿赂他
<5-14,Ross>tip the scales in my direction.

152
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:20,910
<5-15,Monica>来吧  从窗户说不定能看到
<5-15,Monica>Check it out, you can probably see it from the window.

153
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:27,230
<5-15,Monica>是那个打了蝴蝶结的弹球机吗
<5-15,Monica>Oh, is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it?

154
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:28,030
<5-16,Ross>不是
<5-16,Ross>No.

155
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:30,750
<5-17,Chandler>那辆新的山地车
<5-17,Chandler>That new mountain bike?

156
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:31,970
<5-18,Ross>不是
<5-18,Ross>No.

157
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,330
<5-19,Monica>那你送的是什么
<5-19,Monica>Well what did you send?

158
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,580
<5-20,Ross>一篮小松饼
<5-20,Ross>A basket of mini-muffins.

159
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:41,860
<5-21,Phoebe>但桌上全都是小松饼篮
<5-21,Phoebe>But there's a whole table of mini-muffin baskets.

160
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:43,380
<5-21,Phoebe>哪一篮是你送的
<5-21,Phoebe>Which one did you send?

161
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,250
<5-22,Ross>小的那一篮
<5-22,Ross>The small one.

162
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,250
<5-23,Rachel>你真以为那篮松饼
<5-23,Rachel>What?! You-you actually thought

163
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,320
<5-23,Rachel>能帮你争取到公寓吗
<5-23,Rachel>that basket was gonna get you the apartment?

164
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:53,650
<5-24,Ross>对啊  我们办公室曾经收到一篮
<5-24,Ross>Well yeah! Someone sent us a basket at work once

165
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,720
<5-24,Ross>大家都爱得不得了
<5-24,Ross>and people went crazy over those little muffins.

166
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:58,300
<5-24,Ross>那天真的好开心
<5-24,Ross>It was the best day.

167
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:00,100
<5-25,Chandler>你的工作让我觉得好伤心
<5-25,Chandler>Your work makes me sad.

168
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:05,550
<5-26,Ross>真是的  我好想要那间公寓
<5-26,Ross>Oh man! I want that place so much!!

169
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,130
<5-26,Ross>我还以为一定会成功的
<5-26,Ross>I was so sure that was gonna work!

170
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:11,020
<5-26,Ross>那十二块算是扔到水里了
<5-26,Ross>There's twelve bucks I'll never see again!

171
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,790
<5-27,Rachel>亲爱的  想看电影就得快了
<5-27,Rachel>All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.

172
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,260
<5-28,Monica>再见
<5-28,Monica>Bye!

173
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:19,760
<5-30,Phoebe>钱德勒再见  我已经开始想你了
<5-30,Phoebe>Bye Chandler! I miss you already.

174
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:28,720
<5-31,Chandler>看到了吗  她嗲声嗲气还捏我
<5-31,Chandler>Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!

175
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:29,970
<5-32,Monica>我看到了
<5-32,Monica>Actually, I did!

176
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,810
<5-33,Chandler>你现在相信她对我有意思了吧
<5-33,Chandler>Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?

177
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:37,670
<5-34,Monica>天哪  她知道我们的事了
<5-34,Monica>Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!

178
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,870
<5-35,Chandler>真的吗
<5-35,Chandler>Are you serious?

179
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,620
<5-36,Monica>菲比知道了  她想吓我们
<5-36,Monica>Phoebe knows and she's just trying to freak us out!

180
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:43,640
<5-36,Monica>这是唯一的解释
<5-36,Monica>That's the only explanation for it!

181
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,420
<5-37,Chandler>那我好捏的屁股
<5-37,Chandler>Okay but what about y'know my pinchable butt

182
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,500
<5-37,Chandler>和激凸的二头肌呢
<5-37,Chandler>and my bulging biceps-

183
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,670
<5-37,Chandler>她知道了
<5-37,Chandler>She knows!

184
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,870
<6-1,Chandler>-乔伊  -什么事
<6-1,Chandler>- Joey. - Yeah?

185
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:06,280
<6-3,Chandler>菲比知道我们的事了
<6-3,Chandler>Phoebe knows about us!

186
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:07,960
<6-4,Joey>我没告诉她们
<6-4,Joey>Well I didn't tell them!

187
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:10,690
<6-5,Monica>她们  她们是谁
<6-5,Monica>Them?! Who's them?

188
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:14,290
<6-6,Joey>菲比和乔伊
<6-6,Joey>Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey.

189
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:18,000
<6-1,Chandler>乔伊
<6-1,Chandler>Joey.

190
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,400
<6-8,Joey>和瑞秋
<6-8,Joey>And Rachel.

191
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:21,910
<6-8,Joey>我想告诉你们的  但她们让我保证不说
<6-8,Joey>I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!

192
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:26,030
<6-10,Joey>-老天  -对不起  那现在没事了吧
<6-10,Joey>- Oh man! - I'm sorry! But hey, it's over now, right?

193
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:28,070
<6-10,Joey>你们可以告诉她们  你们知道她们知道了
<6-10,Joey>Because you can tell them that you know they know

194
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,800
<6-10,Joey>我就可以恢复一无所知了
<6-10,Joey>and I can go back to knowing absolutely nothing!

195
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:33,250
<6-11,Monica>除非
<6-11,Monica>Unless...

196
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,500
<6-12,Joey>没有除非  现在就要了结
<6-12,Joey>No! Not unless! Look this must end now!

197
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:40,230
<6-13,Monica>她们还自以为高明想耍我们
<6-13,Monica>Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us!

198
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,740
<6-13,Monica>她们不知道  我们知道她们知道了
<6-13,Monica>But see they don't know that we know that they know!

199
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,830
<6-13,Monica>所以
<6-13,Monica>So...

200
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:49,890
<6-14,Chandler>没错  耍人的变成了被耍的
<6-14,Chandler>Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!

201
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:52,900
<7-1,Ross>惨了
<7-1,Ross>Noooo.

202
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:55,890
<7-2,Rachel>罗斯  别再折磨自己了
<7-2,Rachel>Oh Ross, honey you gotta stop torturing yourself!

203
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,860
<7-3,Phoebe>你去找别的房子嘛
<7-3,Phoebe>Yeah, why don't you just find another apartment?

204
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:01,400
<7-4,Ross>我这个月已经看了上千套公寓了
<7-4,Ross>Look I've already looked at like a thousand apartments this month

205
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:04,150
<7-4,Ross>没一间能比得上那一间
<7-4,Ross>and none of them even compares to that one!

206
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,080
<7-5,Rachel>你知道你应该怎么做吗
<7-5,Rachel>Y'know what you should do?

207
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,930
<7-6,Ross>你应该找出他的嗜好
<7-6,Ross>You should find out what his hobbies are

208
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,030
<7-7,Rachel>拿来跟他套交情
<7-7,Rachel>and then use that to bond with him.

209
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,920
<7-7,Rachel>例如  如果我对乔伊有所求
<7-7,Rachel>Yeah! Like if I would want something from Joey,

210
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:17,010
<7-7,Rachel>我就会聊  三明治
<7-7,Rachel>I would strike up a conversation about say umm, sandwiches.

211
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,640
<7-7,Rachel>或是我的内衣
<7-7,Rachel>Or uh, or my underwear.

212
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:22,950
<7-8,Joey>我在听
<7-8,Joey>I'm listening.

213
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:28,850
<7-9,Rachel>-看到没  -好棒的主意
<7-9,Rachel>- See? - That is a great idea!

214
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,500
<7-10,Ross>而且我了解丑裸男
<7-10,Ross>And! I know Ugly Naked Guy

215
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,840
<7-10,Ross>因为我们偷窥他五年了
<7-10,Ross>because we've been watching him for like five years

216
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:36,920
<7-10,Ross>所以我又重新占了上风
<7-10,Ross>so that gives me back my edge!

217
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:40,280
<7-10,Ross>想想看  他有一张蹦床
<7-10,Ross>Oh, let's see now he had the trampoline.

218
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:41,440
<7-11,Phoebe>被他跳坏了
<7-11,Phoebe>He broke that.

219
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:42,890
<7-12,Ross>他有一双重力靴
<7-12,Ross>Well, he had gravity boots.

220
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,590
<7-13,Rachel>也被他穿坏了
<7-13,Rachel>Yeah, he broke those too.

221
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,850
<7-14,Joey>所以他喜欢破坏东西
<7-14,Joey>So he likes to break stuff.

222
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,350
<7-15,Ross>我得去接本
<7-15,Ross>Okay, I've got to go pick up Ben

223
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,340
<7-15,Ross>不过我会想出来的
<7-15,Ross>but I-I will figure something out.

224
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,220
<7-15,Ross>他之前是不是有一只猫
<7-15,Ross>Hey, didn't he used to have a cat?

225
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:59,680
<7-16,Phoebe>别提那个  会害他心情不好
<7-16,Phoebe>I wouldn't bring that up, it would probably just bum him out.

226
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:02,340
<7-17,Joey>可怜的猫咪  没看到大屁股压下来
<7-17,Joey>Yeah, poor cat, never saw that big butt coming.

227
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:07,630
<7-18,Ross>喂
<7-18,Ross>Hello.

228

00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:27,930
<7-23,Chandler>我不心动是骗人的
<7-23,Chandler>I'd be lying if I said I wasn't intrigued.

<7-24,Phoebe>是吗
<7-24,Phoebe>Really?

<7-26,Phoebe>天哪  他让我去摸他的二头肌和别的地方
<7-26,Phoebe>Oh my God! He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!

00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,870
<7-27,Rachel>-开玩笑吗  -真的

<7-29,Rachel>-乔伊  他们知道我们知道了吗  -不知道
<7-29,Rachel>- Joey, do they know that we know? - No.
