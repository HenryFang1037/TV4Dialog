88
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:04,450
<4-13,Chandler>你以为她会安静坐着   会跟我们举杯致意
<4-13,Chandler>Think she'll sit quietly? Think she'll want to make a toast?

89
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:08,460
<4-13,Chandler>你不会还以为她会唱《兼职情人》吧
<4-13,Chandler>You don't think she'll grab the microphone and sing "Part-Time Lover"?

90
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:12,960
<4-14,Monica>她也不会喜欢婚礼上的鸡肉的
<4-14,Monica>Oh, my God. She's not gonna like the chicken either, is she?

91
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:18,000
<4-14,Monica>应该没事
<4-14,Monica>You know what? It'll be okay.

92
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,800
<4-15,Chandler>她也许都不会现身

<4-17,Chandler>-真的  -不  我骗你呢
<4-17,Chandler>- Really? - No, that was a lie.

<4-17,Chandler>看  说谎有多容易
<4-17,Chandler>See how easy that was?

95
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:30,710
<4-18,Monica>所以你能轻易说谎
<4-18,Monica>So you would have just lied?

<5-33,Joey>抱歉  我不这么想

183
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,120
<7-5,Ross>你好  我想问馆方能不能增加人手
<7-5,Ross>Hi, I was wondering, is it possible to increase security...

184
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,290
<7-5,Ross>巡逻古生物学区
<7-5,Ross>...in the paleontology section?

185
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,190
<7-5,Ross>我写的书放在那里
<7-5,Ross>I wrote a book that's up there.

186
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,800
<7-5,Ross>但大家去那里不是看书  而是
<7-5,Ross>And instead of reading it, people are...

187
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:24,160
<7-5,Ross>他们在我的书面前打滚
<7-5,Ross>Well, they're rolling around in front of it.

188
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:28,570
<7-6,The Head Librarian>你反应的问题我们知道
<7-6,The Head Librarian>We are aware of the problem you're referring to.

189
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:34,980
<7-6,The Head Librarian>但增加巡逻这件事
<7-6,The Head Librarian>As far as increasing security,

190
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,040
<7-6,The Head Librarian>恐怕馆方的人力不足
<7-6,The Head Librarian>I'm afraid the library's understaffed.

191
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,720
<7-6,The Head Librarian>我帮不上你的忙
<7-6,The Head Librarian>I can't help you.

192
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,550
<7-7,Ross>好吧
<7-7,Ross>Well, fine.

193
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,650
<7-7,Ross>如果我是唯一愿意欣赏
<7-7,Ross>If I'm the only person with any appreciation...

194
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,020
<7-7,Ross>文字之美的人
<7-7,Ross>...of the sanctity of the written word,

195
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,690
<7-7,Ross>我会亲自去捍卫它
<7-7,Ross>then I'll go defend it myself.

196
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,320
<7-7,Ross>别跟着我
<7-7,Ross>Don't you follow me.

<8-6,Joey>之前非常尴尬  我们都很紧张
<8-6,Joey>That was awkward. We were both nervous.

203
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:14,680
<8-7,Phoebe>-你们不是睡了吗  -那才让我冷静下来
<8-7,Phoebe>- didn't you sleep together? - Yeah, that calms me down.

204
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,690
<8-8,Joey>我们有太多共同点
<8-8,Joey>And we have so much in common.

205
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:24,060
<8-8,Joey>她喜欢三明治和运动  但她是大都会队的球迷
<8-8,Joey>She loves sandwiches, sports. Although she is a Met fan.

206
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:27,230
<8-8,Joey>现在都不是问题了  但如果我们有了孩子
<8-8,Joey>Not an issue now, but if we had kids...

207
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:31,370
<8-9,Rachel>你竟然会提到生孩子的事

<9-1,Janice>我不敢相信克拉克会放我鸽子
<9-1,Janice>I just cannot believe that Clark stood me up.

211
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,210
<9-2,Monica>他应该会来
<9-2,Monica>He may still show up.

212

00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,340
<10-19,Erin>我没打算定下来之类的
<10-19,Erin>...in a serious relationship.

249
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:54,010
<10-20,Phoebe>类似于你总是独来独往之类的
<10-20,Phoebe>You mean, like, that you're kind of a loner?

250
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,640
<10-21,Erin>那就最好不过了
<10-21,Erin>Yeah, that'd be great.

251
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:59,710
<10-22,Phoebe>-也许说你是个混蛋  -抱歉
<10-22,Phoebe>- And maybe that you're a real stronzo. - I'm sorry?

252
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,610
<10-24,Phoebe>看来你会说的四门外语里不包括意大利语
<10-24,Phoebe>I guess Italian isn't one of the four languages you speak.

253
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:08,620
<10-26,Erin>-想走吗  -走吧
<10-26,Erin>- Hey. Want to go? - Yeah, let's go.

254
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,950
<10-27,Joey>-一会见  -再见
<10-27,Joey>- Okay. See you guys later. - Bye, guys.

255
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:15,020
<10-29,Rachel>太感谢你们了
<10-29,Rachel>Hey, thank you so much.

256
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,800
<10-31,Rachel>我猜不是丘比特带她来的
<10-31,Rachel>I guess it wasn't Cupid that brought her here.

257
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,600
<10-32,Phoebe>就是个普通的聋子飞行小矮人
<10-32,Phoebe>No, just a regular old flying dwarf.

258
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,180
<11-1,Ross>怎么了   需要我帮忙吗
<11-1,Ross>Yes, yes? How can I help you?

259
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:38,250
<11-2,Guy>我们只是四处看看
<11-2,Guy>We were just looking around.

260
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:40,750
<11-3,Ross>哦  学者啊
<11-3,Ross>Oh, you're fellow scholars.

261
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:43,460
<11-3,Ross>你们在找什么
<11-3,Ross>What exactly were you looking for?

262
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:47,820
<11-3,Ross>或许你们想看查斯特·史塔克博士的
<11-3,Ross>Perhaps Dr. Chester Stock's musings...

263
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:50,520
<11-3,Ross>封剑齿虎的研究
<11-3,Ross>...on the Smilodon californicus?

264
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:54,660
<11-5,Ross>快滚
<11-5,Ross>Get out of here!

265
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:05,870
<11-5,Ross>你来找人吗
<11-5,Ross>Meeting someone?

266
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,810
<11-5,Ross>还是你想来看看
<11-5,Ross>Or are you just here to brush up...

267
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:11,990
<11-5,Ross>玛莉安对进化论的看法
<11-5,Ross>...on Merriam's views on evolution?

268
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:16,850
<11-6,Woman>事实上  我觉得玛莉安的观点太激进了
<11-6,Woman>Actually, I find Merriam's views far too progressionist.

269
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,800
<11-7,Ross>我也觉得玛莉安的观点太激进了
<11-7,Ross>I find Merriam's views far too progressionist.

270
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:28,200
<11-8,Woman>不好意思  你是
<11-8,Woman>I'm sorry. Who are you?

271
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,600
<11-9,Ross>我是这里的教授  罗斯·盖勒
<11-9,Ross>I'm a professor here. Ross Geller.

272
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:34,540
<11-10,Woman>罗斯·盖勒  我怎么会丢这个名字有印象
<11-10,Woman>Ross Geller? Why do I know that name? It's a...

273
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:35,930
<11-10,Woman>等下
<11-10,Woman>Wait.

274
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:41,250
<11-10,Woman>这是你写的
<11-10,Woman>Did you write this?

275
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,610
<11-10,Woman>对
<11-10,Woman>Yes.

276
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:50,720
<11-11,Ross>你是看了我的书的人
<11-11,Ross>You're the person who checked out my book?

277
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:56,420
<11-12,Woman>你和我想象的一点都不像
<11-12,Woman>You know, you look nothing like I would have thought.

278
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:58,560
<11-12,Woman>如此年轻
<11-12,Woman>You're so young.

279
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:03,540
<11-13,Ross>我3年级的时候跳级了
<11-13,Ross>Well, I skipped fourth grade.

280
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:15,160
<11-14,Ross>真是太抱歉了
<11-14,Ross>I am very, very sorry.

281
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:26,480
<12-3,Rachel>你们的约会还顺利吗
<12-3,Rachel>So how was your date?

282
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,490
<12-4,Phoebe>太棒了  我们在格林威治村散步
<12-4,Phoebe>Great. We walked around the Village.

283
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:31,430
<12-5,Joey>还去了冰淇淋店一起喝一杯奶昔
<12-5,Joey>We went to this ice-cream place. Split a milk shake.

284
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:33,310
<12-5,Joey>我喝的比较多  但还是很棒
<12-5,Joey>Seventy-thirty, but still.

285
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,310
<12-5,Joey>我想带她到北区宾馆去过一夜
<12-5,Joey>I'm thinking of taking her upstate

286
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:37,650
<12-5,Joey>然后早上在床上吃早餐什么的
<12-5,Joey>to one of those bed and breakfasts.

287
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:39,820
<12-6,Phoebe>真的吗   她答应了吗
<12-6,Phoebe>Really? She said she wants to go?

288
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,520
<12-7,Joey>是惊喜
<12-7,Joey>No, it's a surprise.

289
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:45,490
<12-7,Joey>时间难搭配  因为她的工作很忙
<12-7,Joey>It's gonna be tricky because she's busy at work.

290
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:50,860
<12-9,Rachel>甜心  乔伊  我们得谈一谈
<12-9,Rachel>Okay, honey. Joey, we need to talk, okay?

291
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:55,660
<12-9,Rachel>她让我觉得
<12-9,Rachel>I got the feeling from her...

292
00:16:55,940 --> 00:17:00,340
<12-9,Rachel>她没打算定下来
<12-9,Rachel>...that she's not looking for a serious relationship.

293
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,040
<12-10,Joey>-你怎么看出来的  -她告诉我的
<12-10,Joey>- Where are you getting this? - She told me.

294
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,280
<12-13,Rachel>她说她向来独来独往
<12-13,Rachel>She said she's kind of a loner.

295
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:19,120
<12-14,Joey>-乔伊  -瑞秋没事的
<12-14,Joey>- Joey... - Hey, Rach, it's cool, you know.

296
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:22,020
<12-14,Joey>我也都是独来独往的
<12-14,Joey>I'm a loner too, right?

297
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:26,500
<12-15,Phoebe>乔伊  她配不上你
<12-15,Phoebe>Hey, Joey. You know what? You are way too good for her.

298
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,480
<12-16,Rachel>我发誓 下次我会告诉她们
<12-16,Rachel>I promise, next time I will tell them

299
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,640
<12-16,Rachel>你不想定下来
<12-16,Rachel>you're not looking for a relationship.

300
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:37,470
<12-17,Joey>别  只要
<12-17,Joey>No, don't do that. Just...

301
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:42,480
<12-17,Joey>-下一次确定她喜欢我  -我会的
<12-17,Joey>- Next time, make sure she likes me. - Well, that too.

302
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,440
<12-19,Joey>乔伊
<12-19,Joey>Joey?

303
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,730
<12-20,Rachel>-想吃煎饼吗  -终于啊
<12-20,Rachel>- Do you want some pancakes? - Finally.

304
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,300
<13-1,Monica>我们该怎么办
<13-1,Monica>What are we gonna do?

305
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:01,540
<13-2,Chandler>我们该选《无心低语》
<13-2,Chandler>I say we go with "Careless Whisper."

306
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,710
<13-3,Janice>钱德勒
<13-3,Janice>Chandler?

307
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,550
<13-4,Chandler>她看到我们了吗
<13-4,Chandler>Did she see us yet? Did she see us?

308
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,420
<13-5,Monica>珍妮丝  你来这里做什么
<13-5,Monica>Janice, what are you doing here?

309
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:19,460
<13-6,Janice>我想回我家去
<13-6,Janice>I thought I was gonna go back to my apartment...

310
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:24,760
<13-6,Janice>但我觉得今晚我不想独处
<13-6,Janice>...but I just felt like I really couldn't be alone tonight.

311
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:34,210
<13-6,Janice>我在想或许我可以待在你们家
<13-6,Janice>I was just wondering if I could maybe stay here with you.

312
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,780
<13-6,Janice>我真的觉得我该跟家人在一起
<13-6,Janice>Just, I really feel like I need to be with family.

313
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:42,910
<13-7,Monica>我们的孩子会叫她珍妮丝阿姨  对吧
<13-7,Monica>Our kids are gonna call her Aunt Janice, aren't they?

314
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:48,420
<13-8,Janice>拜托  否则我真的不知道自己会不会做傻事
<13-8,Janice>Please. Because otherwise, I really don't know what I might do.

315
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,720
<13-9,Chandler>你不会有点好奇吗
<13-9,Chandler>Aren't you just a teensy bit curious?

316
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:56,460
<13-10,Janice>-你有面纸吗   -有  在浴室里
<13-10,Janice>- Do you have any tissues? - Yeah, in the bathroom.

317
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,070
<13-13,Monica>我们得收留她
<13-13,Monica>We'll just let her stay.

318
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:06,470
<13-14,Chandler>不  如果我们收留她她会永远住在这里
<13-14,Chandler>No. If we let her stay, she will stay forever.

319
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,210
<13-15,Monica>和你的躺椅一样
<13-15,Monica>Kind of like your Barcalounger.

320
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:10,940
<13-16,Chandler>你现在真的在想这个吗
<13-16,Chandler>Is that what you're thinking about right now?

321
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,940
<13-17,Monica>我一直都在想
<13-17,Monica>I never stop thinking about it.

322
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,260
<13-18,Janice>伙计们
<13-18,Janice>Hey, you guys?

323
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:20,220
<13-18,Janice>我洗澡前  你们有人要用浴室吗
<13-18,Janice>Do either one of you want to get in there before I take my bath?

324
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,630
<13-19,Chandler>珍妮丝  我很抱歉
<13-19,Chandler>Janice, I'm sorry...

325
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:27,200
<13-19,Chandler>但是今晚你不能留在这
<13-19,Chandler>...but you can't stay here tonight.

326
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,900
<13-20,Janice>为什么
<13-20,Janice>Why not?

327
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:30,670
<13-21,Chandler>说实话吗
<13-21,Chandler>Honestly?

328
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:34,140
<13-21,Chandler>我们家因为电磁辐射的关系
<13-21,Chandler>Our apartment is a hotbed...

329
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:36,940
<13-21,Chandler>遭到了污染
<13-21,Chandler>...for electromagnetic activity.

330
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:41,780
<13-21,Chandler>莫妮卡跟我已经免疫了  但不幸地
<13-21,Chandler>Monica and I have been immunized, but sadly...

331
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:45,050
<13-21,Chandler>你没有免疫力
<13-21,Chandler>...you have not.

332
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:52,860
<13-22,Janice>我需要一条棉被
<13-22,Janice>I'm gonna need a comforter.

333
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:54,820
<13-22,Janice>你有抗过敏的棉被吗
<13-22,Janice>Do you have a hypoallergenic one?

334
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,630
<13-22,Janice>否则我鼻子灰过敏
<13-22,Janice>Because otherwise I get very nasal.

335
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:03,630
<13-22,Janice>你们养了猫吗   因为我已经开始过敏了
<13-22,Janice>Do you have a cat? Because it's already happening.

336
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,700
<13-22,Janice>你们听到了吗   你们听
<13-22,Janice>Do you hear that? Listen.

337
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:12,350
<13-23,Monica>我的天啊  你非离开不可
<13-23,Monica>Oh, my God! Oh, my God! You have to go.

338
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:13,540
<13-24,Janice>为什么
<13-24,Janice>Why?

339
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,880
<13-25,Monica>因为钱德勒对你还有感觉
<13-25,Monica>Because Chandler still has feelings for you.

340
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,660
<13-26,Janice>是吗
<13-26,Janice>He does?

341
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,730
<13-27,Chandler>再说一次
<13-27,Chandler>Say again?

342
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:28,760
<13-27,Chandler>对  对
<13-27,Chandler>That's right. That's right.

343
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,060
<13-28,Monica>所以你不能留下
<13-28,Monica>And that is why you can't stay here tonight.

344
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:35,470
<13-28,Monica>你也不应该参加我们的婚礼
<13-28,Monica>And probably why you shouldn't come to the wedding.

345
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:39,510
<13-29,Chandler>感觉  他对你还有感觉
<13-29,Chandler>Feelings. Such strong feelings.

346
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:42,520
<13-30,Monica>我懂
<13-30,Monica>I mean, I realize that

347
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,750
<13-30,Monica>他对你的感觉可能永远不会消失
<13-30,Monica>his feelings may never completely go away...

348
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:48,010
<13-30,Monica>但是你可以
<13-30,Monica>...but you can.

349
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,920
<13-30,Monica>我的天啊
<13-30,Monica>Oh, my God.

350
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:55,790
<13-31,Janice>我理解  对不起
<13-31,Janice>I understand. I am so sorry.

351
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,430
<14-1,Ross>我走
<14-1,Ross>I'll go.

352
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:04,290
<14-2,Chandler>再见  莫妮卡
<14-2,Chandler>Goodbye, Monica.

353
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:08,600
<13-31,Janice>希望你们白头偕老
<13-31,Janice>I wish you a lifetime of happiness with him.

354
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:09,870
<13-31,Janice>钱德勒
<13-31,Janice>Chandler.

355
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,140
<13-31,Janice>和丫离婚的时候给我打电话
<13-31,Janice>You call me when this goes in the pooper.

356
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,320
<14-1,Ross>别紧张  这一区有我
<14-1,Ross>Don't sweated, I got this section covered.

357
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:32,520
<14-1,Ross>事实上  我搞了这么一个小手电照人眼睛
<14-1,Ross>Yeah, in fact, I've got this baby to shine in people's eye...

358
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:34,490
<14-1,Ross>再见啦
<14-1,Ross>Okay, see you later.

359

<14-2,Chandler>I just wanted to show Monica your book.
