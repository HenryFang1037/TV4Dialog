<9-5,Joey>到了
<9-5,Joey>All right!

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,330
<1-1,Ross>太棒了  从家里到医院花了不到七分钟
<1-1,Ross>Yes! From home to the hospital in under seven minutes!

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:08,250
<1-1,Ross>我们办到了
<1-1,Ross>We did it.

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,510
<1-2,Rachel>对  最艰苦的部分彻底结束了
<1-2,Rachel>Yes, the hard part is truly over.

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:12,880
<1-2,Rachel>打起精神来
<1-2,Rachel>No, but come on,

6
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:14,890
<1-3,Ross>我们算是开了个好头  对吧
<1-3,Ross>we're off to a great start, aren't we?

7
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:16,110
<1-3,Ross>我知道可以很快赶过来
<1-3,Ross>I knew I'd get here fast.

8
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:18,380
<1-3,Ross>但这个速度一定是创下了记录
<1-3,Ross>But this has gotta be some kind of a record!

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,290
<1-4,Phoebe>-你们赶到了  -嗨
<1-4,Phoebe>- Oh, you made it! - Hi.

10
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:24,720
<1-7,Ross>你们怎么会比我们先到
<1-7,Ross>How the hell did you beat us here?

11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,070
<1-8,Monica>我们搭的计程车  你们是走过来的吗
<1-8,Monica>We took a cab. Did you guys walk?

12
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,280
<1-9,Ross>不  我们也是搭计程车  但我做过实验...
<1-9,Ross>No, we took a cab too. But I did test runs...

13
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,080
<1-11,Joey>你们赶到了
<1-11,Joey>Hey, you made it!

14
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:38,270
<1-12,Ross>好吧  难不成有魔法地道通到这家医院吗
<1-12,Ross>Okay, is there some kind of magic tunnel to this hospital?

15
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:39,910
<1-13,Rachel>罗斯  你留下来聊天
<1-13,Rachel>Ross, you stay here and talk.

16
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:41,770
<1-13,Rachel>我要去生孩子了
<1-13,Rachel>I'm gonna go have a baby.

17
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:45,610
<1-13,Rachel>好吧  你好  她是瑞秋·格林
<1-13,Rachel>Okay. Hi, this is Rachel Greene.

18
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:47,920
<1-14,Ross>我是罗斯·盖勒  我们在车上打过电话
<1-14,Ross>I'm Ross Geller. We called from the car.

19
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,690
<1-15,Nurse>对  我们为你们准备了双人待产室
<1-15,Nurse>Right. We have a semi-private labor room waiting for you, so...

20
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:54,060
<1-16,Rachel>对不起  双人房
<1-16,Rachel>Oh, whoa! I'm sorry. Semi-private?

21
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:56,960
<1-16,Rachel>我们订了单人房
<1-16,Rachel>We asked for a private room.

22
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,210
<1-17,Nurse>我知道
<1-17,Nurse>Yes, I see that here.

23
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,950
<1-17,Nurse>不幸地是我们无法保证一定有单人房
<1-17,Nurse>Unfortunately, we can't guarantee a private room.

24
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:03,370
<1-17,Nurse>现在单人房都满了
<1-17,Nurse>And, currently, they're all unavailable.

25
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:05,390
<1-18,Chandler>你要是早点赶过来就好了
<1-18,Chandler>Man, if only you'd gotten here sooner.

26
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:10,250
<1-19,Nurse>抱歉 我们只有双人待产室
<1-19,Nurse>I'm sorry. Semi-private rooms are all we have.

27
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:14,020
<1-20,Rachel>好吧  等我们一下  罗斯
<1-20,Rachel>Okay. Just give us a second. Ross?

28
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,110
<1-21,Ross>什么
<1-21,Ross>Yeah?

29
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,850
<1-22,Rachel>塞点钱给她
<1-22,Rachel>Give her some money.

30
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:21,980
<1-23,Ross>我觉得他们真的没房间了
<1-23,Ross>I really think they're out of rooms.

31
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:22,950
<1-24,Rachel>才怪  罗斯
<1-24,Rachel>They're not, Ross.

32
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,970
<1-24,Rachel>他们是为大人物留的
<1-24,Rachel>They're just saving them for important people!

33
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:26,710
<1-24,Rachel>好吧  如果我是总统呢
<1-24,Rachel>Okay? What if I was the president?

34
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:28,240
<1-25,Ross>那么我们的麻烦就大了
<1-25,Ross>Well, then, we'd be in a lot of trouble.

35
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,520
<1-25,Ross>你不知道任何国家的地理位置
<1-25,Ross>You don't know where any countries are.

36
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,440
<1-25,Ross>好吧
<1-25,Ross>Okay.

37
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:38,260
<1-25,Ross>你能再帮我们确认一遍吗
<1-25,Ross>Say, would you mind checking again?

38
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:42,760
<1-25,Ross>有没有我们可以使用的单人待产室
<1-25,Ross>See if any private rooms may have opened up?

39
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,740
<1-26,Nurse>这里是医院
<1-26,Nurse>This is a hospital.

40
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,550
<1-26,Nurse>好吧  你知道吗  我得说
<1-26,Nurse>Okay, you know what? I have to say,

41
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,470
<1-27,Rachel>我真的不喜欢你的语气
<1-27,Rachel>I don't really care for your tone.

42
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,260
<1-27,Rachel>这不是市里唯一一家医院
<1-27,Rachel>And this is not the only hospital in this city,

43
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:55,470
<1-27,Rachel>我们完全可以... 天啊
<1-27,Rachel>and we have no problem... Oh, gosh!

44
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:58,000
<1-28,Ross>-什么  -是阵痛
<1-28,Ross>- What? What? - Contraction!

45
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,480
<1-30,Nurse>你们想看看双人待产室吗
<1-30,Nurse>Would you like to see a semi-private room?

46
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,340
<1-31,Rachel>好吧  看看又何妨
<1-31,Rachel>Yeah, it couldn't hurt to look.

58
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,790
<2-1,Dr. Long>你的子宫颈只开了两公分
<2-1,Dr. Long>Well, you're only two centimeters dilated,

59
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,380
<2-1,Dr. Long>得等开到十公分才行
<2-1,Dr. Long>and we need to get to 10.

60
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:50,750
<2-2,Rachel>-那得等上一段时间  -好吧
<2-2,Rachel>- It'll be a while. - Oh, okay.

<2-3,Dr. Long>-我一小时后再回来帮你检查  -谢谢
<2-3,Dr. Long>- I'll be back in an hour to check you again.- Thank you.

62
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,230
<2-5,Rachel>看来这段时间我们有的闲了
<2-5,Rachel>I guess we have some time to kill.

63
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:59,360
<2-6,Ross>没错
<2-6,Ross>Yeah, guess so.

00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,040
<3-1,Phoebe>三个小时过去了还是没生
<3-1,Phoebe>Oh, wow. Three hours and still no baby.

93
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,450
<3-1,Phoebe>生产的奇迹让人很想打磕睡
<3-1,Phoebe>The miracle of birth sure is a snooze-fest.

94
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:48,260
<3-2,Monica>你要看点好玩的事吗
<3-2,Monica>Hey, you wanna see something?

97
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:53,120
<3-4,Monica>看我怎么吓钱德勒
<3-4,Monica>Watch me freak out Chandler.

98
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:55,760
<3-5,Chandler>-老公  -什么事
<3-5,Chandler>- Honey? - Yeah?

99
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,860
<3-6,Monica>听着  我一直在想
<3-6,Monica>Listen, I've been doing some thinking...

100
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:02,240
<3-6,Monica>我不知道是因为我们身处医院
<3-6,Monica>...and I don't know whether it's because we're here...

101
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,370
<3-6,Monica>还是瑞秋要生孩子了
<3-6,Monica>...or Rachel's giving birth...

102
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:10,560
<3-6,Monica>但我觉得我们应该开始造小孩了
<3-6,Monica>...but I think we should try to have a baby.

103
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,390
<3-7,Chandler>好吧
<3-7,Chandler>Okay.

104

<3-8,Monica>What's that now?

105
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,630
<3-9,Chandler>好吧  我也一直在想这件事
<3-9,Chandler>Okay. I've been thinking about it too,

106
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,360
<3-9,Chandler>我觉得我们准备好了
<3-9,Chandler>and I think we're ready.

107
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:27,790
<3-10,Monica>你在开玩笑吗
<3-10,Monica>Are you kidding me?

108
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:30,510
<3-10,Monica>你觉得我们现在就准备好要怀孕了
<3-10,Monica>You think we're ready to have a baby now?

109
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:31,920
<3-11,Phoebe>这确实很好玩
<3-11,Phoebe>This is fun.

110
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,280
<3-12,Joey>你们准备要怀孕了
<3-12,Joey>You're ready to have a baby?

111
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,500
<3-12,Joey>我的小男孩长大了
<3-12,Joey>My boy's all grown up!

112
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:39,650
<3-13,Chandler>你说你也准备好了
<3-13,Chandler>You said you were ready too.

113
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:41,380
<3-14,Monica>对  我只是想跟你开玩笑
<3-14,Monica>Yeah, but I was just screwing with you

114
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,830
<3-14,Monica>逼你用高八度的怪声音说话
<3-14,Monica>to try to get your voice all high and weird...

115
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,720
<3-14,Monica>就像我现在一样
<3-14,Monica>...like mine is now!

116
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,740
<3-15,Chandler>对  但你不是一直都想要生孩子吗
<3-15,Chandler>Yes, but haven't you wanted a kid, like, forever?

117
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,900
<3-16,Monica>好吧  滚开  先生
<3-16,Monica>Okay, then, back off, mister!

118
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:55,900
<3-16,Monica>我确实准备好生孩子了
<3-16,Monica>Because I am ready to have a baby.

119
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,670
<3-16,Monica>我只是希望乔伊是孩子他爸
<3-16,Monica>I just want Joey to be the father.

120
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,030
<3-17,Joey>什么  你疯了吗
<3-17,Joey>What? Are you crazy?

121
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:04,030
<3-18,Monica>就是那样  那就是我的目的
<3-18,Monica>That's it, right there! That's all I wanted!

122
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:08,220
<4-1,Marc>实在抱歉
<4-1,Marc>I am so sorry.

123
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:11,080
<4-1,Marc>医生坚持要拉上帘子做检查
<4-1,Marc>The doctor insisted on closing the curtain for the exam.

124
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,230
<4-2,Rachel>那非常... 真的没关系
<4-2,Rachel>Oh, that's very... Really, very, very okay.

125
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,490
<4-3,Marc>茱莉的子宫颈开了七公分
<4-3,Marc>Julie's cervix is dilated seven centimeters.

126
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:19,290
<4-3,Marc>大约是四指宽
<4-3,Marc>That's about four fingers!

127
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:22,530
<4-3,Marc>医生让我自己摸摸看
<4-3,Marc>Doctor let me feel it myself.

128
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:24,390
<4-4,Julie>你摸过瑞秋的子宫颈吗  罗斯
<4-4,Julie>Have you felt Rachel's cervix, Ross?

129
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:26,640
<4-6,Ross>-没有  我们不会那么做  -我们不会那么做

160
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,980
<6-1,Ross>问我为什么不跟瑞秋结婚

<6-5,Ross>别说了  现在我没法想这件事

<17-2,Rachel>如果你再推个女人进来  她又比我先生
<17-2,Rachel>If you bring in one more woman who has her baby before me,

<17-5,Nurse>我想下一位产妇不会太快生
<17-5,Nurse>I don't think the next patient is very far along.

<18-3,Janice>这简直太棒了

<18-4,Ross>Squeeze your legs together and cover the baby's ears.

<18-10,Janice>你得大声一点  他几乎完全失去听力了
<18-10,Janice>You have to speak very loudly, he's almost completely deaf.
