224
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:51,550
<6-33,Ross>我只是觉得这样不好
<6-33,Ross>I just don't think this is a good idea.

225
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,800
<6-34,Rachel>我们不做怎么知道好不好
<6-34,Rachel>Well, we won't know that until we do it,

227
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,370
<6-35,Ross>不  你看  嗯…
<6-35,Ross>No, look, uh.

228
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:59,960
<6-35,Ross>你为你父亲的事儿心烦
<6-35,Ross>You are upset about your father,

229
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:01,600
<6-35,Ross>你现在很脆弱
<6-35,Ross>and you're feeling vulnerable...

230
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:03,270
<6-35,Ross>而且我觉得这时候
<6-35,Ross>...and I just don't feel it

231
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,070
<6-35,Ross>这么做不对
<6-35,Ross>would be right.

232
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,440
<6-35,Ross>我会觉得
<6-35,Ross>I feel like I'd be, you know,

233
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:06,600
<6-36,Rachel>这是在占你便宜
<6-36,Rachel>taking advantage of you.

234
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:07,720
<6-36,Rachel>什么 占便宜
<6-36,Rachel>What--? Taking advantage?

237
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:18,130
<6-37,Ross>但我认为我们俩得有一个保持清醒
<6-37,Ross>...but I think one of us has to be thinking clearly.

238
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,110
<6-38,Rachel>所以我要走了
<6-38,Rachel>So I'm gonna go.

<7-5,Chandler>You know, I've been to these places before...

251
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,910
<7-5,Chandler>但是我都没有好好看过风景
<7-5,Chandler>...but I've never really seen them.

252
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,810
<7-6,Monica>没错  你学牛叫的时候错过好多风景
<7-6,Monica>Yeah, you miss a lot when you're mooing.

253
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,960
<7-7,Erica>非常感谢你们带我观光
<7-7,Erica>Thank you for showing me around.

254
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:11,520
<7-8,Monica>哦  我们很高兴陪你去
<7-8,Monica>Oh, it was our pleasure.

255
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:13,670
<7-8,Monica>我们也想跟你熟悉熟悉
<7-8,Monica>We're so much enjoying getting to know you.

256
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:16,280
<7-9,Erica>呃  你们还有什么想了解的吗
<7-9,Erica>Well, if there's anything else you wanna know....

257
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,640
<7-9,Erica>好吧
<7-9,Erica>Okay.

258
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:23,140
<7-10,Chandler>你不会介意我问几个
<7-10,Chandler>Can we ask you some questions

259
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:24,380
<7-10,Chandler>有关孩子父亲的问题吧
<7-10,Chandler>about the father?

260
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:26,360
<7-11,Erica>哦  没关系
<7-11,Erica>Oh, sure. Yeah.

261
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:28,940
<7-11,Erica>他是我高中的男朋友
<7-11,Erica>Well, he was my high-school boyfriend,

262
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:31,340
<7-11,Erica>足球队长  很可爱
<7-11,Erica>captain of the football team, really cute.

263
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,360
<7-11,Erica>后来他得到奖学金  上了大学
<7-11,Erica>Got a scholarship and went to college.

264
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:35,470
<7-12,Chandler>那不错啊
<7-12,Chandler>That's great.

265
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:39,410
<7-13,Erica>是啊  差不多就是他了
<7-13,Erica>Yeah, it's almost definitely him.

266
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:42,930
<7-14,Monica>那怎么说
<7-14,Monica>How's that, now?

267
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:46,200
<7-15,Erica>也有可能是另外一个人
<7-15,Erica>Well, there's a chance it's another guy.

268
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,660
<7-15,Erica>我是说  我只跟两个人好过
<7-15,Erica>I mean, I've only ever been with two guys...

269
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,030
<7-15,Erica>但是时间上有些重叠
<7-15,Erica>...but they sort of overlapped.

270
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,850
<7-16,Chandler>那么  另一个人是干什么的
<7-16,Chandler>So, what does the other guy do?

271
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,380
<7-16,Chandler>他也上大学了吗
<7-16,Chandler>Does he go to college too?

272
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:57,810
<7-17,Erica>不  他在蹲监狱
<7-17,Erica>No, he's in prison.

273
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,620
<7-18,Monica>那他是被诬告的吧
<7-18,Monica>Was he falsely accused of something?

274
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,410
<7-18,Monica>不
<7-18,Monica>No.

275
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,870
<7-19,Erica>他用铁铲杀了他爸爸
<7-19,Erica>He killed his father with a shovel.

276
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,970
<7-19,Erica>但是除此之外  他还是个不错的人
<7-19,Erica>Other than that, he's a great guy.

277
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:15,320
<7-20,Chandler>我猜他爸爸不这么想
<7-20,Chandler>I'll bet his dad doesn't think so.

278
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,080
<7-22,Chandler>-你醒着呢吗   -我当然还醒着
<7-22,Chandler>- Are you awake? - Of course I'm awake.

279
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:29,290
<7-22,Chandler>从今往后我是睡不着啦
<7-22,Chandler>Assume from now on that I'm always awake.

280
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,920
<7-23,Monica>好啦  我们也不确定就一定是他
<7-23,Monica>All right, we don't know that it's him.

281
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:35,440
<7-23,Monica>我是说  也可能是那个踢足球的
<7-23,Monica>I mean, it could be the football guy.

282
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:36,620
<7-24,Chandler>亲爱的  我们这对儿倒霉蛋
<7-24,Chandler>Honey, it's us.

283
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:38,470
<7-24,Chandler>肯定是摊上那个铁铲杀手
<7-24,Chandler>Of course it's the shovel killer.

284
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:45,320
<7-25,Monica>好了  好了  就算是他
<7-25,Monica>Well, all right, let's say that it is him.

285
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:47,280
<7-25,Monica>我们就不要这孩子了  不
<7-25,Monica>Would we not want the baby? No.

286
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:48,730
<7-25,Monica>我们会对他另眼相待吗
<7-25,Monica>Would we treat him any differently?

287
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,240
<7-26,Chandler>我会一直提防着他的
<7-26,Chandler>I'd keep an eye on him.

288
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,420
<7-26,Chandler>我们一定得查出哪一个是孩子的父亲
<7-26,Chandler>We have to find out who the father is.

289
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,330
<7-27,Monica>-怎么查  -我不知道
<7-27,Monica>- How? - I don't know.

290
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,340
<7-28,Chandler>这种事儿可以测出来的  对吧
<7-28,Chandler>They have tests for these things, right?

291
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:01,430
<7-29,Monica>是  不过我们也许反应过度了
<7-29,Monica>Yes, but maybe we're just overreacting.

292
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,820
<7-30,Chandler>你说得当然轻巧
<7-30,Chandler>Easy for you to say.

293
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:04,250
<7-30,Chandler>他杀的是他爸爸
<7-30,Chandler>He's a father killer.

294
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:07,670
<7-30,Chandler>他没准儿很爱他老妈
<7-30,Chandler>He probably loves his mommy.

295
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,760
<7-30,Chandler>他没准儿在挥铲子的胳膊上
<7-30,Chandler>He's probably got a tattoo

296
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:10,970
<7-30,Chandler>刺着"妈妈"呢
<7-30,Chandler>that says "Mom" on his shovel-wielding arm.

297
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,050
<8-1,Tape>"现在我们从一数到五"
<8-1,Tape>We'll now count from one to five.

298
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,780
<8-3,Tape>-"说得真好"  -谢谢
<8-3,Tape>- Good job. - Thank you.

299
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,310
<8-5,Phoebe>-嘿  -嘿  乔伊
<8-5,Phoebe>- Hey. - Hey, Joey.

300
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:38,650
<8-7,Phoebe>听我说  昨天的事儿我觉得不太好
<8-7,Phoebe>Listen, I feel really badly about yesterday,

301
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,180
<8-7,Phoebe>我想了很多
<8-7,Phoebe>and I thought about it a lot.

302
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:41,790
<8-7,Phoebe>我想是我太没有耐心了
<8-7,Phoebe>No, I was too impatient.

303
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,330
<8-7,Phoebe>所以  我们今天再试试
<8-7,Phoebe>So let's try it again.

304
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,360
<8-8,Joey>哦不  不用了  我不用你帮忙了
<8-8,Joey>That's okay. I don't need your help.

305
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:46,220
<8-8,Joey>我可以自学
<8-8,Joey>I worked on it myself,

306
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:48,140
<8-8,Joey>而且我得说我学得还不错嘞
<8-8,Joey>and I gotta say I am pretty good.

307
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:50,980
<8-9,Phoebe>真的  说几句给我听听
<8-9,Phoebe>Really, can I hear some of it?

308
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,170
<8-10,Joey>当然可以
<8-10,Joey>Sure, sure.

309
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:54,720
<8-10,Joey>好
<8-10,Joey>Okay.

310
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,210
<8-11,Phoebe>怎么样
<8-11,Phoebe>See?

311
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,900
<8-11,Phoebe>好吧  你说的不是...
<8-11,Phoebe>You, you're not--

312
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,250
<8-11,Phoebe>你不是在...
<8-11,Phoebe>You're not-- You're--

313
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,580
<8-11,Phoebe>我再次重申  你说的不是法语
<8-11,Phoebe>Again, you're not speaking French!

314
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:16,520
<8-12,Joey>哦  我觉着我说的是法语
<8-12,Joey>Oh, well, I think I am.

315
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:18,710
<8-12,Joey>而且我肯定能得到那个角色
<8-12,Joey>Yeah, and I think I'm definitely gonna get the part.

316
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,750
<8-13,Phoebe>你怎么会这么想的
<8-13,Phoebe>How could you possibly think that?

317
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,560
<8-14,Joey>至少
<8-14,Joey>For one thing.

318
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:22,400
<8-14,Joey>磁带上的那家伙说
<8-14,Joey>The guy on the tape

319
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:23,780
<8-14,Joey>我念得不错
<8-14,Joey>said I was doing a good job!

320
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,900
<9-1,Ross>嗨  瑞秋  给我倒杯咖啡好吗
<9-1,Ross>Hey, Rach, can you grab me a cup of coffee?

<9-2,Rachel>Sure.

322
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,290
<9-3,Ross>你一早上话不多
<9-3,Ross>You've been quiet all morning.

323
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,330
<9-3,Ross>没事儿吧
<9-3,Ross>Is everything okay?

324
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,260
<9-5,Ross>-你肯定没事  -当然

<9-8,Rachel>有个意见供你参考
<9-8,Rachel>FYI.

328
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:51,680
<9-9,Ross>得  来啦
<9-9,Ross>There it is.

329
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:54,490
<9-10,Rachel>以后
<9-10,Rachel>In the future...

330
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:58,620
<9-10,Rachel>如果有女孩子需要点不理智的安慰性的爱爱
<9-10,Rachel>...when a girl asks for some ill-advised sympathy sex,

331
00:15:58,670 --> 00:15:59,810
<9-10,Rachel>你就满足她好啦
<9-10,Rachel>just do it.

332
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:05,080
<9-11,Ross>等等  你是因为昨晚的事儿生我的气
<9-11,Ross>Wait, wait, you're mad at me about last night?

333
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,280
<9-11,Ross>我只是想做对的事
<9-11,Ross>I was just trying to do the right thing.

334
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:08,040
<9-11,Ross>真的
<9-11,Ross>Really?

335
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,330
<9-12,Rachel>对我来说
<9-12,Rachel>It seems to me.

336
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,320
<9-12,Rachel>要是你做得对的话
<9-12,Rachel>If you had done the right thing...

337
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:11,620
<9-12,Rachel>我就不会一早醒来
<9-12,Rachel>...l wouldn't have woken up

338
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,240
<9-12,Rachel>感觉又愚蠢又尴尬
<9-12,Rachel>feeling stupid and embarrassed.

339
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:16,250
<9-12,Rachel>我只会觉得舒适而满意
<9-12,Rachel>I would've woken up feeling comforted and satisfied.

340
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:20,470
<9-14,Rachel>-呃...  -哦  得了吧
<9-14,Rachel>- Well-- - Oh, stop that!

341
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,850
<9-15,Ross>我不敢相信  你怎么...
<9-15,Ross>I can't believe this. What you...

342
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:25,190
<9-15,Ross>我只是做了回好人
<9-15,Ross>I was just being a good guy.

343
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,780
<9-15,Ross>我以尊重和同情之心待你
<9-15,Ross>I treated you with respect and understanding.

344
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,530
<9-16,Rachel>啊  那可真性感
<9-16,Rachel>Oh, that is so hot.

345
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,430
<9-17,Ross>嘿  我是在为你着想
<9-17,Ross>Hey, I was looking out for you.

346
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,490
<9-17,Ross>哦  真的  罗斯
<9-17,Ross>Oh, really? Well, Ross,

347
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,110
<9-18,Rachel>你要知道  我不是个小丫头
<9-18,Rachel>you know what? I am a big girl.

348
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,380
<9-18,Rachel>我不需要有人告诉我
<9-18,Rachel>I don't need someone telling me

349
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:37,870
<9-18,Rachel>什么对我来说最好
<9-18,Rachel>what is best for me.

350
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,360
<9-19,Ross>虽说以前我也经常没过成性生活
<9-19,Ross>I gotta say, I've not had sex a lot of times before.

351
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:43,110
<9-19,Ross>但这次是最糟糕的
<9-19,Ross>This is the worst ever!

352
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,200
<9-20,Rachel>哦  真的  真的
<9-20,Rachel>Oh, really? Really?

353
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,160
<9-20,Rachel>这对我来说也好不到哪儿去
<9-20,Rachel>Well, it wasn't very good for me either.

354
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:48,270
<9-20,Rachel>哦  你猜...
<9-20,Rachel>Okay, you know--?

355
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,690
<9-21,Ross>嘿  嘿  你猜怎么着
<9-21,Ross>Hey, hey, you know what?

356
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,720
<9-21,Ross>为了以后少这种麻烦
<9-21,Ross>To avoid this little thing in the future...

357
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:52,720
<9-21,Ross>咱们就干脆说定
<9-21,Ross>...let's just say you and me?

358
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:54,400
<9-21,Ross>你我以后再也不上床了
<9-21,Ross>Never having sex again.

359
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,300
<9-22,Rachel>什么
<9-22,Rachel>What?

360
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:57,460
<9-23,Ross>对了  "性"这个字以后免谈
<9-23,Ross>That's right! Sex is off the table!

361
00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:00,440
<9-23,Ross>我再也不会跟你睡觉啦
<9-23,Ross>I am never having sex with you again!

362
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,220
<9-23,Ross>格林医生  你感觉好点儿了吗
<9-23,Ross>Dr. Green, are you feeling better?

363
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,230

00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:18,510
<10-2,Erica>我想求你一件事
<10-2,Erica>I wanted to ask you something.

367
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:22,190
<10-2,Erica>这对我来说很重要   如果是个男孩
<10-2,Erica>It would really mean a lot to me if the baby was a boy...

368
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,180
<10-2,Erica>你能不能让孩子  随我父亲的名字
<10-2,Erica>...that you name him after my father...

369
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,180
<10-2,Erica>吉米尼·比利·鲍勃
<10-2,Erica>...Jiminy Billy Bob.

370
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:34,040
<10-3,Chandler>-哦  真的  -不
<10-3,Chandler>- Oh, really? - No!

371
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,500
<10-4,Erica>你说得没错  这真好玩
<10-4,Erica>You were right. That was fun.

372
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:40,720
<10-4,Erica>我要去收拾东西了
<10-4,Erica>I'm gonna go finish packing.

373
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:46,720
<10-5,Chandler>那么  她愿意去做检测吗
<10-5,Chandler>So is she gonna take the test?

374
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:47,910
<10-6,Monica>不  用不着了
<10-6,Monica>No, she doesn't have to.

375
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,410
<10-6,Monica>我知道谁是父亲
<10-6,Monica>I found out who the father is.

376
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,330
<10-7,Chandler>哦  上帝
<10-7,Chandler>Oh, God.

377
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:52,090
<10-7,Chandler>是铁铲乔  对吧
<10-7,Chandler>It's Shovely Joe, isn't it?

378
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:53,720
<10-8,Monica>不  不是的
<10-8,Monica>No, it's not.

379
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:54,890
<10-9,Chandler>你怎么知道的
<10-9,Chandler>How do you know?

380
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:58,130
<10-10,Erica>看来艾瑞卡性教育课学得不好
<10-10,Erica>Erica didn't pay attention in sex ed class...

381
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,020
<10-10,Erica>她跟蹲监狱的家伙
<10-10,Erica>...because the things

382
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,050
<10-10,Erica>做的事
<10-10,Erica>she did with that prison guy?

383
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,340
<10-10,Erica>不太可能让她怀孕
<10-10,Erica>It'd be pretty hard to make a baby that way.

384
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:03,780
<10-11,Chandler>天呐  什么姿势
<10-11,Chandler>Oh, God, what was it?

385
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:04,980
<10-11,Chandler>是我们很少做的
<10-11,Chandler>The thing we hardly ever do,

386
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:06,460
<10-12,Monica>还是我们从没做过的
<10-12,Monica>or the thing we never do?

387
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,770
<10-12,Monica>我们从没做过的
<10-12,Monica>The thing we never do.

388
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,500
<10-13,Chandler>铁铲乔
<10-13,Chandler>Shovely Joe.

00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,710
<11-5,Director>乔伊  你会说法语吗
<11-5,Director>Joey, do you speak French?

394
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,190
<11-7,Director>我看这次试镜就到此为止吧
<11-7,Director>You know what? I think this audition is over.

<11-8,Phoebe>I am Regine Phalange.

397
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:02,290
<11-8,Phoebe>我刚路过
<11-8,Phoebe>I was passing by

398
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,320
<11-8,Phoebe>听到这个人在说
<11-8,Phoebe>when I heard this man speaking...

399
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:09,830
<11-8,Phoebe>我们法国小镇雅诗兰黛的方言
<11-8,Phoebe>...the regional dialect of my French town of Estee Lauder.

400
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:14,510
<11-9,Director>你真的认为这个人在说法语
<11-9,Director>You really think this man is speaking French?

00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:46,270
<11-12,Phoebe>干得不错  小家伙
<11-12,Phoebe>Good job, little buddy.

00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:51,710
<11-13,Director>你的法语讲得很好
<11-13,Director>That was some really good French.

409
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,150
<11-13,Director>但是我觉得还是
<11-13,Director>But I think we're gonna go with

410
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,600
<11-13,Director>其他人更适合这个角色
<11-13,Director>someone else for the part.

411
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:57,390
<11-14,Joey>哦  好吧  但是我的法语很好
<11-14,Joey>All right, but my French was good?

<12-3,Ross>-那我看我该走了   -好的
<12-3,Ross>- So I guess I'm gonna take off. - Okay.

417
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:19,550
<12-4,Rachel>嘿  听我说  你走之前  我…
<12-4,Rachel>Hey, listen, just before you go--

418
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,190
<12-4,Rachel>我想再次谢谢你
<12-4,Rachel>I just wanna say thank you

419
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,260
<12-4,Rachel>能陪我一起去看我爸
<12-4,Rachel>for coming with me.

420
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:23,460
<12-5,Ross>没问题
<12-5,Ross>Oh, no problem.

421
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,670

<12-6,Rachel>And also, you know, l--

422
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:28,990
<12-6,Rachel>我在想你说的话
<12-6,Rachel>I was thinking about what you said,

423
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,480
<12-6,Rachel>你知道的  关于性什么的…
<12-6,Rachel>you know, about the whole sex thing....

424
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:34,930
<12-6,Rachel>也许再重蹈覆辙确实不是个好主意
<12-6,Rachel>Probably not a great idea to go down that road again.

425
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,320
<12-7,Ross>谢谢  我很高兴你也这么想
<12-7,Ross>Thank you. I'm glad you agree.

426
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,060
<12-8,Rachel>这也有点可惜
<12-8,Rachel>It's a shame, though.

427
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,970
<12-8,Rachel>我是说   我们做的时候感觉不错
<12-8,Rachel>When we did it, it was pretty good.

428
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:44,680
<12-9,Ross>对
<12-9,Ross>Yeah.

429
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,950
<12-9,Ross>对  那倒是真的

00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:51,170
<12-10,Rachel>嘿  你还记得特别棒的那次
<12-10,Rachel>Hey, do you remember that one really great time?

431
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,150
<12-12,Rachel>-哦  记得  -你记得
<12-12,Rachel>- Oh, yeah! - You know?

432
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,490
<12-13,Ross>那天是情人节...
<12-13,Ross>It was Valentine's Day.

433
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:55,710
<12-12,Rachel>是你的生日...
<12-12,Rachel>It was your birthday.

00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:58,830
<12-14,Both>-哦  对呀  -哦  对呀
<12-14,Both>- Oh, yeah. - Oh, yeah.

435
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,400
<12-15,Rachel>我想那都是陈年往事了
<12-15,Rachel>Well, I guess that's all in the past now.

436
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,800
<12-17,Rachel>-以后再也不干了  -一次也不
<12-17,Rachel>- Not even one more time. - Not even once.

437
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:17,350
<12-18,Ross>不管我们有多想要
<12-18,Ross>No matter how much we want it.

438
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,680
<12-20,Ross>即使我们真的...
<12-20,Ross>Even if we want it...

439
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:20,470
<12-20,Ross>真的很想要
<12-20,Ross>...really bad.

440
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,090
<12-21,Rachel>我们就这么说定的
<12-21,Rachel>That's what we decided.

441
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,680
<12-22,Ross>没错
<12-22,Ross>Right.

442
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:28,160
<12-23,Rachel>但这有点难哦
<12-23,Rachel>It's kind of hard, though. You know?

443
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:28,690
<12-24,Ross>是啊
<12-24,Ross>Yeah.

444
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:32,330
<12-25,Rachel>你知道  既然两人有了那种联系
<12-25,Rachel>You know. When two people have a connection,

445
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,670
<12-25,Rachel>如果不用...
<12-25,Rachel>you know, that's--

446
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:36,530
<12-25,Rachel>就好像
<12-25,Rachel>Just seems like...

447
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:38,250
<12-25,Rachel>好像是
<12-25,Rachel>...such a...

448
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,150
<12-26,Ross>种浪费
<12-26,Ross>...waste.
