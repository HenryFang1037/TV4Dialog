2
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,790
<1-1,Joey>关于瑞秋的那件事呢
<1-1,Joey>All that stuff about Rachel?

3
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:13,310
<1-1,Joey>现在你没那种感觉了  那简直太疯狂了
<1-1,Joey>You don't feel that now. It was crazy.

4
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,740
<1-1,Joey>你没事  你好的不得了
<1-1,Joey>You're fine. You're better than fine.

5
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:20,700
<1-1,Joey>你就像朋友汤尼说的那样  "棒极了"
<1-1,Joey>You are, as your friend Tony would say, "Great!"

6
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:25,720
<1-1,Joey>一切都很正常
<1-1,Joey>Everything's normal.

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,230
<1-1,Joey>她只是你的朋友  瑞秋
<1-1,Joey>She's just your friend, Rachel.

8
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:30,820
<1-1,Joey>你的朋友瑞秋
<1-1,Joey>Your friend, Rachel.

9
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,520

10
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:36,280
<1-2,Rachel>嗨  亲爱的
<1-2,Rachel>Hi, sweetie.

11
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:39,790
<1-3,Joey>嗨  她是你女朋友瑞秋
<1-3,Joey>Hey, it's your girlfriend, Rachel!

23
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,550
<2-1,Monica>你...你磕嗨了吗
<2-1,Monica>Are you...? Are you high?

24
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:32,160
<2-2,Chandler>我刚刚泡了一个超舒服的澡
<2-2,Chandler>I just had the most amazing bath.

25
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:34,260
<2-3,Monica>真的吗  我不喜欢泡澡
<2-3,Monica>Really? I don't like baths.

26
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,910
<2-4,Chandler>你喜欢跟我泡鸳鸯浴啊
<2-4,Chandler>Wait. You like them with me.

27
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:37,330
<2-5,Monica>亲爱的  我喜欢的不是泡澡
<2-5,Monica>Honey, it's not the bath I enjoy.

28
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:38,940
<2-6,Chandler>我是喜欢看全身湿答答的裸体女人
<2-6,Chandler>It's the wet, naked lady.

29
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,910
<2-7,Monica>泡澡能让你全身放松
<2-7,Monica>Baths are so relaxing.

30
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:44,910
<2-7,Monica>真的吗  你在里面做什么
<2-7,Monica>Really? What do you do?

31
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:47,790
<2-8,Chandler>不过是坐在浴缸里  泡着自己洗过的脏水
<2-8,Chandler>You just sit in there, stewing in your own filth.

32
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,890
<2-9,Monica>你觉得我能有多脏呢
<2-9,Monica>How dirty do you think I am?

33
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,070
<2-9,Monica>如果你点上蜡烛
<2-9,Monica>I'm telling you if you had some candles

34
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:57,830
<2-9,Monica>配上泡泡跟音乐  你一定会爱上泡澡
<2-9,Monica>and some bubbles and some music, you would love it.

35
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:59,950
<2-9,Monica>能帮你解除压力  一身轻松
<2-9,Monica>It would take all of your stress away.

36
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,570
<2-10,Chandler>现在是星期三下午两点  我正在看越野单车赛
<2-10,Chandler>Honey, it's 2:00 on a Wednesday and I'm watching Road Rules.

37
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:04,370
<2-10,Chandler>你觉得我的压力会有多大
<2-10,Chandler>How stressed do you think I am?

38
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,100
<2-11,Joey>钱德勒
<2-11,Joey>Hey, Chandler.

39
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:11,930
<2-11,Joey>你有空吗  我真的需要跟你谈一谈
<2-11,Joey>You got a minute? I really need to talk to you.

40
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:14,820
<2-12,Chandler>好  这场谈话是要配冷披萨
<2-12,Chandler>Oh, yeah. Is this a cold-pizza talk

41
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,520
<2-12,Chandler>还是配剩肉卷
<2-12,Chandler>or a leftover-meat loaf talk?

42
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,830
<2-13,Joey>都不是
<2-13,Joey>Well, neither.

43
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,390
<2-14,Chandler>天啊  发生了什么大事
<2-14,Chandler>Oh, my God, what's up?

44
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:24,370
<2-14,Chandler>我不知道  只是...
<2-14,Chandler>I don't know. It's just...

45
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,740
<2-15,Joey>最近我觉得...
<2-15,Joey>Lately, I've been feeling...

46
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,870
<2-15,Joey>好吧  事情是这样的
<2-15,Joey>Okay, here's what it is.

47
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:38,510
<2-15,Joey>你知道吗  我觉得好多了  谢谢
<2-15,Joey>You know what? I feel a lot better. Thanks.

48
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,030
<2-16,Chandler>快回来告诉我
<2-16,Chandler>Just come back.

49
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,660
<2-16,Chandler>好吧
<2-16,Chandler>Okay.

50
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:49,620
<2-17,Joey>你跟莫妮卡当了很久的朋友
<2-17,Joey>You and Monica, friends for a long time.

51
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,490
<2-17,Joey>当然这是有规则的
<2-17,Joey>And sure, there are rules.

52
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:53,990
<2-17,Joey>之后你们去了伦敦
<2-17,Joey>But then you went to London.

53
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,600
<2-17,Joey>可是那不一样
<2-17,Joey>But that's different.

54
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,580
<2-17,Joey>这也是有规则的  你理解我的意思吗
<2-17,Joey>There are rules there too, you know what I mean?

55
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,130
<2-18,Chandler>你自己理解吗
<2-18,Chandler>Do you?

56
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:05,340
<2-19,Joey>你们的情况和我不一样
<2-19,Joey>It was different for you guys.

57
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,600
<2-19,Joey>你们刚好在同一个地方  对吧
<2-19,Joey>I mean, you were both in the same place, right?

59
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,890
<2-20,Chandler>-在伦敦  -对
<2-20,Chandler>- In London? - Yeah.

60
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:12,680
<2-22,Chandler>对  莫妮卡跟我在伦敦时我们刚好都在那里
<2-22,Chandler>Yes, when Monica and I were in London, we were both in London.

61
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,020
<2-23,Joey>我就不该来找你
<2-23,Joey>You know what. This is a bad idea.

62
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:17,320
<2-23,Joey>算了  就当我什么都没说
<2-23,Joey>Forget it. Forget all about it.

63
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,770
<2-23,Joey>帮我个忙  别把这件事说出去
<2-23,Joey>And listen, do me a favor, this conversation between you and me.

64
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:22,670
<2-24,Chandler>我会尽力的
<2-24,Chandler>If that.

65
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:31,950
<3-1,Rachel>罗斯  别忘了明天我们要一起去产检
<3-1,Rachel>Oh, Ross, don't forget we have that doctor's appointment tomorrow.

66
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:34,530
<3-3,Phoebe>-好  -你们要知道宝宝的性别了吗
<3-3,Phoebe>- Right. - Hey, are you going to find out the sex of the baby?

67
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:36,420
<3-4,Ross>不  我们不想知道
<3-4,Ross>No. We talked about it. We don't wanna know.

68
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,870
<3-4,Ross>我们只在乎宝宝是不是健康快乐
<3-4,Ross>All we care about is that it's happy and healthy.

69
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:41,180
<3-5,Rachel>对  健康快乐  还有可爱
<3-5,Rachel>Yep, happy and healthy. And cute.

70
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,750
<3-6,Ross>-聪明  -万人迷
<3-6,Ross>- And smart. - Popular.

71
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,370
<3-8,Ross>还要有科学精神
<3-8,Ross>With an aptitude for science.

72
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,610
<3-9,Phoebe>你们两个说的是同一个宝宝吗
<3-9,Phoebe>Are you two talking about the same baby?

73
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:50,960
<3-9,Phoebe>你们开始想名字了吗
<3-9,Phoebe>Hey, have you thought of names yet?

74
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,150
<3-10,Rachel>对  我想到一大堆
<3-10,Rachel>Oh, yeah. I've come up with a bunch of ideas.

75
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,110
<3-11,Ross>-真的吗  我也是  -我也是
<3-11,Ross>- Really? Me too. - Me too.

76
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:56,800
<3-13,Rachel>真的吗
<3-13,Rachel>Really?

77
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:01,830
<3-14,Phoebe>如果是女孩就叫菲比  如果是男孩就叫菲宝
<3-14,Phoebe>If it's a girl, Phoebe. And if it's a boy, Pheebo.

78
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:05,630
<3-15,Ross>或许吧
<3-15,Ross>Maybe.

79
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,120
<3-15,Ross>但多想些备用名字应该有益无害
<3-15,Ross>But it wouldn't hurt to have a backup, you know?

80
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,240
<3-15,Ross>-瑞秋  你都想到什么名字  -好吧
<3-15,Ross>- Rach, what were you thinking? - Okay.

81
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,990
<3-16,Rachel>我想如果是女孩
<3-16,Rachel>I was thinking if it's a girl...

82
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:18,940
<3-16,Rachel>叫她珊德妮好吗  这是法文
<3-16,Rachel>...how about Sandrene? It's French.

83
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:23,500
<3-17,Ross>很适合做工业溶剂公司的名字
<3-17,Ross>That's a really pretty name for an industrial solvent.

84
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,090
<3-18,Rachel>好吧  你想到什么
<3-18,Rachel>Okay, fine. What do you have?

85
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:30,680
<3-19,Ross>我想到一个男孩的名字
<3-19,Ross>It's for a boy.

86
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,740
<3-19,Ross>我知道起这个名字有点疯狂
<3-19,Ross>I know it's a little out there, but...

87
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,780
<3-19,Ross>达尔文
<3-19,Ross>...Darwin.

88
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,060
<3-20,Rachel>天啊  我们的孩子会在操场上被打死
<3-20,Rachel>Oh, my God. Our child will be beaten to death in the schoolyard.

89
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,030
<3-21,Phoebe>对  被珊德妮打死
<3-21,Phoebe>Yeah, by Sandrene.

90
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,650
<3-22,Ross>你那么说是因为我不喜欢你想的名字
<3-22,Ross>You're just saying that because I said no to your name.

91
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:48,590
<3-23,Rachel>我是本来就不喜欢
<3-23,Rachel>I'm really, really not.

92
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:52,280
<3-24,Phoebe>你们各有五次否决权  如何
<3-24,Phoebe>How about you each get five vetoes?

93
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,010
<3-27,Ross>听起来很公平
<3-27,Ross>That sounds fair.

94
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,600
<3-28,Rachel>不过我觉得你根本用不着否决  听着
<3-28,Rachel>I don't think you'll need it though. Check this out.

95
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,500
<3-28,Rachel>如果是女孩就叫小雨
<3-28,Rachel>If it's a girl, Rain.

96
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:01,860
<3-29,Ross>否决
<3-29,Ross>Veto.

97
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,340
<3-30,Rachel>为什么
<3-30,Rachel>Why?

98
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:08,050
<3-31,Ross>小雨  "嗨  我叫小雨
<3-31,Ross>Rain? "Hi, my name is Rain.

99
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:12,400
<3-31,Ross>我有自己的炉子  我的衣服是用麦子做的"
<3-31,Ross>I have my own kiln, and my dress is made out of wheat."

100
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,600
<3-32,Phoebe>我认识她
<3-32,Phoebe>I know her!

101
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:19,650
<3-32,Phoebe>我在死人秀里跟她买了一块手工肥皂
<3-32,Phoebe>I bought a homemade soap from her at a Dead show!

102
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:24,810
<3-33,Ross>好  如果是男孩就叫撒切尔
<3-33,Ross>Okay. How about for a guy, Thatcher?

103
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:27,160
<3-34,Rachel>罗斯  你为什么那么恨我们的孩子
<3-34,Rachel>Ross, why do you hate our child?

104
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:30,210
<3-35,Ross>-好吧  轮到你了  -詹姆斯
<3-35,Ross>- Fine, you go. - Okay. James.

<3-38,Rachel>-如果是女孩的话  -否决
<3-38,Rachel>- But only if it's a girl. - Veto.

106
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,210
<3-39,Ross>我喜欢萝丝  你觉得呢
<3-39,Ross>How about... I like Ruth. What about Ruth?

107
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:40,090
<3-40,Rachel>抱歉  难道我们的宝宝89岁了吗
<3-40,Rachel>Oh, I'm sorry. Are we having an 89-year-old?

111
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:53,300
<3-45,Phoebe>你们没觉得"否决"这个名字很好听吗
<3-45,Phoebe>Is it me, or is Veto starting to sound really good?

112
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:01,910
<4-2,Monica>天啊  我为你准备了一个大惊喜
<4-2,Monica>Boy, do I have a surprise for you.

113
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:03,340
<4-3,Chandler>在阳台上做爱吗
<4-3,Chandler>Sex on the balcony?

114
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:07,490
<4-4,Monica>不  但某人一直放不下这个念头是吧
<4-4,Monica>No. But someone's really not gonna get over that idea, are they?

115
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:10,320
<4-5,Chandler>-怎么了  -我帮你放了洗澡水
<4-5,Chandler>- What is it? - I drew you a bath.

<4-6,Monica>我不喜欢泡澡
<4-6,Monica>I don't like baths.

117
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:14,870
<4-7,Chandler>你愿意跟我去阳台上做爱吗
<4-7,Chandler>Could you draw me a picture of us having sex on the balcony?

118
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:18,910
<4-8,Monica>拜托你试试看  我使出了全部绝招
<4-8,Monica>Please. Will you just try it for me. I used all my best stuff.

119
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:21,200
<4-8,Monica>我点了蜡烛  放了音乐
<4-8,Monica>I lit some candles, I put on some music.

120
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,200
<4-8,Monica>用了浴盐跟泡泡浴
<4-8,Monica>I used bath salts, plus bubble bath.

121
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:27,690
<4-8,Monica>我还帮你找了个海军模型船
<4-8,Monica>And got you this little plastic Navy ship!

122
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,390
<4-8,Monica>体现你的男性雄风
<4-8,Monica>So it's a boy bath.

123
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,890
<4-9,Chandler>确实稍微增添了点男人味
<4-9,Chandler>This does butch it up a bit.

124
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,030
<4-10,Monica>我发誓你试过后一定会爱上泡澡的
<4-10,Monica>I swear, if you try it, you will love it.

125
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,080
<4-11,Chandler>如果我答应泡澡
<4-11,Chandler>If I do this,

126
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,390
<4-11,Chandler>我们能不能至少讨论在阳台上做爱的事
<4-11,Chandler>can we at least discuss sex on the balcony?

127
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,660
<4-12,Monica>当然可以
<4-12,Monica>Absolutely.

128
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:44,420
<4-13,Monica>但我知道那场讨论会如何进行

129
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,940
<5-1,Chandler>好吧  还不赖
<5-1,Chandler>All right, this isn't so bad.

130
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:59,360
<5-1,Chandler>我喜欢花香味
<5-1,Chandler>I like the flowery smell.

131
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,550
<5-1,Chandler>这没什么不妥  因为我手上有船
<5-1,Chandler>Which is okay, because I've got my boat.

132
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:10,330
<5-3,Chandler>-怎么样  -我的天啊
<5-3,Chandler>- So? - Oh, my God.

133
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,450
<5-4,Monica>我就说过你会喜欢泡澡嘛
<5-4,Monica>I told you you were a bath person.

134
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:15,280
<5-4,Monica>等你洗完  我可以帮你做脸
<5-4,Monica>Hey, when you get out, maybe I can give you a facial.

135
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:17,870
<5-5,Chandler>我需要一艘更雄伟的船
<5-5,Chandler>I'm gonna need a bigger boat.

136
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,790
<5-5,Chandler>我觉得你对萝丝这个名字不够开通
<5-5,Chandler>I don't think you had an open mind about the name Ruth.

137
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,690
<6-1,Ross>拜托嘛  小萝丝·盖勒  多可爱啊
<6-1,Ross>I mean, come on, little Ruthie Geller? How cute is that?

138
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:38,950
<6-2,Rachel>天啊  我仿佛听到了搓麻将的声音
<6-2,Rachel>Oh, my God, I can practically hear the mahjong tiles.

139
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:42,630
<6-3,Dr. Long>好了  检查结果都很正常
<6-3,Dr. Long>Okay. All your tests look fine.

140
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,470
<6-3,Dr. Long>你们想知道宝宝的性别吗
<6-3,Dr. Long>Are you two interested in knowing the sex of the baby?

141
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:47,170
<6-4,Ross>我们不想知道
<6-4,Ross>No, we're not.

142
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,750
<6-5,Rachel>但病历里面有记录
<6-5,Rachel>But you have it right there in that file?

143
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:51,940
<6-5,Rachel>你可以告诉我们是男孩或是女孩
<6-5,Rachel>You could tell us whether it's a boy or a girl?

144
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:55,220
<6-5,Rachel>戴顿或珊德妮  菲比或菲宝
<6-5,Rachel>Dayton or Sandrene? Phoebe or Pheebo?

145
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:58,310
<6-6,Dr. Long>没错  如果你们不想知道
<6-6,Dr. Long>That's right. But if you don't wanna know...

146
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:02,540
<6-7,Ross>-不  我们愿意等  对吧  -对
<6-7,Ross>- No, we wanna wait. Right? - Right. Right.

147
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:05,030
<6-8,Rachel>我马上回来
<6-8,Rachel>Oh, I'll be right back.

148
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:09,050
<6-9,Dr. Long>我知道自己不该多嘴
<6-9,Dr. Long>I know it's really not my place...

149
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:11,940
<6-9,Dr. Long>但请不要给宝宝取名叫菲宝
<6-9,Dr. Long>...but please don't name your child Pheebo.

150
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,920
<6-10,Rachel>你觉得哪个宝宝最丑
<6-10,Rachel>So which of these babies do you think is the ugliest?

151
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:24,200
<6-11,Ross>什么  瑞秋  你这么说太恶毒了
<6-11,Ross>What? Rach, come on, that's terrible.

152
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,580
<6-11,Ross>他们是宝宝  都很可爱
<6-11,Ross>They're babies. They're all beautiful.

153
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,700
<6-12,Rachel>左起第三个
<6-12,Rachel>Third one from the left?

154
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,880
<6-13,Ross>对  他为什么要盯着我看
<6-13,Ross>Yeah. Why is it staring at me?

155
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:34,350
<6-13,Ross>他大概知道我在说他坏话
<6-13,Ross>I think it knows I'm talking about it.

156
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:37,420
<6-14,Rachel>-你不...  -怎么了
<6-14,Rachel>- Don't you...? - What?

157
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:38,430
<6-15,Ross>你在偷看
<6-15,Ross>You're looking!

158
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:39,790
<6-17,Ross>-我没有  -我看到了
<6-17,Ross>- I didn't! - I saw you!

159
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:42,420
<6-18,Rachel>好吧  我在偷看  但我什么都没有看到
<6-18,Rachel>Fine, I did, but I didn't see anything. I swear.

160
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:45,830
<6-19,Ross>你太可耻了  丑宝宝唾弃你
<6-19,Ross>Shame on you! Ugly baby judges you!

161
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,850
<6-20,Rachel>好吧  听我说  我没有...
<6-20,Rachel>Okay. But Ross, listen to me, I didn't...

162
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:50,990
<6-21,Ross>别告诉我  我不想知道
<6-21,Ross>No, no. Don't tell me! I don't wanna know!

163
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:53,670
<6-22,Rachel>我想说也没办法  因为我也不知道
<6-22,Rachel>I couldn't even if I wanted to, because I don't know!

164
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:55,560
<6-22,Rachel>我发誓我什么都没看到
<6-22,Rachel>I swear I didn't see anything!

165
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,810
<6-22,Rachel>我不想知道  刚刚我是一时糊涂
<6-22,Rachel>I don't want to know. It was just a momentary lapse.

166
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:00,250
<6-23,Ross>一时糊涂
<6-23,Ross>Momentary lapse?

167
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,460
<6-23,Ross>你不懂得自制吗
<6-23,Ross>Don't you have any self-control?

168
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,610
<6-24,Rachel>好吧  你要是能早几个月做这场说教就好了
<6-24,Rachel>Okay. A couple months late on the lecture, Ross.

169
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,380
<7-1,Monica>我回来了
<7-1,Monica>Hello?

170
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,860
<7-2,Chandler>我在浴室  你能进来一下吗
<7-2,Chandler>I'm in the bathroom. Can you come in here?

171
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,370
<7-2,Chandler>我觉得不太对劲
<7-2,Chandler>I think there's something wrong.

172
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:18,310
<7-3,Monica>我还是在这里等着吧
<7-3,Monica>You know what? I think I'll wait out here.

173
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,490
<7-4,Chandler>我在浴缸里
<7-4,Chandler>I'm in the bathtub.

174
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,120
<7-5,Monica>怎么了
<7-5,Monica>What's wrong?

175
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:29,260
<7-6,Chandler>我自己放了洗澡水  但方法不对
<7-6,Chandler>I drew my own bath, but I did it wrong.

176
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:31,200
<7-6,Chandler>水不冷不热  浴盐没有溶解
<7-6,Chandler>The water's tepid, the salt didn't dissolve

177
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,050
<7-6,Chandler>现在都结块了
<7-6,Chandler>and is now lodged places.

178
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,520
<7-6,Chandler>我用的几种香料闻起来很不协调
<7-6,Chandler>And the scents I used don't compliment each other.

179
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,560
<7-6,Chandler>桉树加甘菊
<7-6,Chandler>Eucalyptus and chamomile?

180
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:43,570
<7-8,Chandler>-怎么了  -浴盐
<7-8,Chandler>- What? - Bath salts.

181
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:45,920
<7-8,Chandler>开始冒泡了
<7-8,Chandler>They're starting to effervesce.

182
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,490
<7-8,Chandler>感觉完全不同
<7-8,Chandler>It's different.

183
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,670
<7-8,Chandler>这感觉真有意思
<7-8,Chandler>It's interesting.

184
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,650
<7-9,Monica>好吧  我们谈谈别的事吧
<7-9,Monica>Okay. Let's talk about something else.

185
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:58,870
<7-10,Chandler>好  今天你过得还好吧
<7-10,Chandler>Yeah. Sure. So, what was going on with you today?

186
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:05,190
<7-11,Monica>乔伊今天跟我聊了一些很奇怪的事情
<7-11,Monica>I actually had the weirdest conversation with Joey.

187
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:08,640
<7-11,Monica>他谈到规则  还有对错
<7-11,Monica>He was talking about rules and right and wrong.

188
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:11,000
<7-12,Chandler>我也跟他谈过这些
<7-12,Chandler>I had the exact same conversation.

189
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,100
<7-13,Monica>是吗  他到底在说什么
<7-13,Monica>You did? What was he talking about?

190
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,240
<7-14,Chandler>自从他演过《麦克白》之后
<7-14,Chandler>I don't know. Joey hasn't had this much trouble

191
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,870
<7-14,Chandler>我还没见过他说不出话的样子
<7-14,Chandler>getting out words since we saw him in Macbeth.

192
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,410
<7-15,Monica>那可真是漫长的一夜
<7-15,Monica>That was a long night.

193
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,120
<7-16,Chandler>好吧  我们来分析一下
<7-16,Chandler>All right, let's break this down.

194
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:25,940
<7-16,Chandler>他到底跟你说了什么
<7-16,Chandler>What exactly did he say to you?

195
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,960
<7-17,Monica>他说到规则
<7-17,Monica>Okay. He was talking about rules

196
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:31,270
<7-19,Monica>对别人有了不同的感觉
<7-19,Monica>and looking at people differently.

197
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,770
<7-20,Chandler>他没有跟我说那个问题
<7-20,Chandler>He didn't say anything about that to me.

198
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:34,130
<7-21,Monica>他跟你说了什么
<7-21,Monica>What'd he tell you?

199
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:37,140
<7-22,Chandler>他问到你跟我在伦敦发生的事
<7-22,Chandler>He was asking all this questions about you, me and London.

200
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:40,360
<7-22,Chandler>从头至尾都在谈规则
<7-22,Chandler>And of course the glue that holds this all together, the rules.

201
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:45,240
<7-23,Monica>好吧  你跟我在伦敦
<7-23,Monica>Okay. So you, me and London.

202
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:47,280
<7-23,Monica>对别人有不同的感觉
<7-23,Monica>Looking at people differently.

203
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:52,460
<7-23,Monica>或许他想跟某人发生你跟我在伦敦所做的事
<7-23,Monica>Maybe he wants to do what you and I did in London with someone.

204
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,180
<7-24,Chandler>但他说"规则"是什么意思
<7-24,Chandler>But what'd he mean by "rules"?

205
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:59,050
<7-25,Monica>等一下  菲比走进来时  他就不说了
<7-25,Monica>Wait a minute. He stopped talking the minute Phoebe came in.

206
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:00,670
<7-26,Chandler>因为他对她的感觉不同了
<7-26,Chandler>Because he was looking at her differently.

207
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,890
<7-27,Monica>菲比是他的朋友
<7-27,Monica>And Phoebe is his friend.

208
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:05,750
<7-27,Monica>他觉得那样违反了规则
<7-27,Monica>So he thinks that would be breaking the rules.

209
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,860
<7-28,Chandler>天啊  他想跟菲比在伦敦上床
<7-28,Chandler>My God, he wants to do it with Phoebe in London!

210
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,500
<7-29,Phoebe>-你们在哪里  -等一下
<7-29,Phoebe>- You guys? - Just a minute!

211
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:14,580
<7-30,Monica>崔比安尼太太来了
<7-30,Monica>That's Mrs. Tribbiani.

212
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:17,220
<7-31,Chandler>什么都别说
<7-31,Chandler>You don't say anything.

213
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,840
<7-32,Monica>我为什么要说
<7-32,Monica>Why would I say anything?

214
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,720
<7-32,Monica>我们的两个好朋友
<7-32,Monica>That two of our friends could start

215
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,060
<7-32,Monica>就要展开一段伟大恋情
<7-32,Monica>the greatest love affair of their lives?

216
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:25,080
<7-32,Monica>他们将来可要谢我
<7-32,Monica>They would have me to thank.

217
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:27,300
<7-32,Monica>然后我们可以一起开始怀孕生孩子
<7-32,Monica>Then we could all start having babies!

218
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,470
<7-33,Chandler>我不准你告诉她
<7-33,Chandler>I'm not gonna let you say anything.

219
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:30,790
<7-34,Monica>你就待在这里
<7-34,Monica>You just stay here.

220
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:32,750
<7-35,Chandler>天啊
<7-35,Chandler>Oh, God!

221
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,720
<7-36,Phoebe>莫妮卡  我拿熨斗来还你
<7-36,Phoebe>Hey, Monica, I brought back your iron.

222
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,730
<7-37,Monica>是你拿走的吗  我还以为我弄丢了
<7-37,Monica>Oh, you had that? I thought I lost it.

223
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:43,490
<7-39,Monica>一个月前  我买了个新的
<7-39,Monica>I got a new one a month ago.

224
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:45,770
<7-40,Phoebe>太好了  我把这个弄坏了
<7-40,Phoebe>Oh, just as well. I broke this one.

225
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:53,440
<7-42,Monica>-怎么  -没事
<7-42,Monica>- What? - Nothing.

226
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:54,730
<7-43,Phoebe>好吧
<7-43,Phoebe>Okay.

227
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:59,270
<7-44,Monica>我实在不该说  我不该说出来的
<7-44,Monica>I really shouldn't say. I'm really not supposed to.

228
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:00,870
<7-45,Phoebe>好吧
<7-45,Phoebe>Fine.

229
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,260
<7-46,Monica>这可是个好消息
<7-46,Monica>It's a humdinger.

230
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,880
<7-47,Phoebe>可惜你不能告诉我
<7-47,Phoebe>Well, then it's really too bad that you can't tell me.

231
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:08,550
<7-48,Monica>有人喜欢你
<7-48,Monica>Somebody likes you!

232
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,100
<7-49,Phoebe>是钱德勒吗
<7-49,Phoebe>Is it Chandler?

233
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,570
<7-51,Phoebe>-不是  -那叫他别再盯着我看了
<7-51,Phoebe>- No! - Then tell him to stop staring.

234
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,110
<7-52,Monica>是乔伊
<7-52,Monica>It's Joey.

235
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:25,510
<7-53,Phoebe>真的吗  乔伊  看不出来啊
<7-53,Phoebe>Really? Joey? You don't say.

236
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,940
<7-54,Monica>你对他有意思吗
<7-54,Monica>Is it something you'd be interested in?

237
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,800
<7-54,Monica>我不知道  我不知道
<7-54,Monica>I don't know, I don't know. I don't know.

238
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:34,780
<7-55,Phoebe>我一方面会想"天啊  我可以跟他在一起吗"
<7-55,Phoebe>You know, I mean, on the one hand, "Mother, may I?"

239
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,840
<7-55,Phoebe>但另一方面
<7-55,Phoebe>But, you know, on the other hand...

240
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,670
<7-55,Phoebe>不行  我们是朋友
<7-55,Phoebe>No. No, I can't. We're friends.

241
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:47,450
<7-55,Phoebe>不行  我不能拿我们现在的友谊冒险
<7-55,Phoebe>Oh, no. I don't wanna risk what we have.

242
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,300
<7-56,Monica>你说得有道理
<7-56,Monica>I guess that makes sense.

243
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,970
<7-56,Monica>你要跟他谈一谈吗
<7-56,Monica>You think you're gonna talk to him?

244
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:54,830
<7-57,Phoebe>当然  他可是乔伊
<7-57,Phoebe>Sure. I mean, it's Joey.

245
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:56,500
<7-57,Phoebe>我不希望他受伤害
<7-57,Phoebe>I don't want him to get hurt.

246
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:59,630
<7-57,Phoebe>我简直是势不可挡啊
<7-57,Phoebe>Well, I must say, I am on fire!

247
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:01,500
<7-57,Phoebe>先是钱德勒  现在又是乔伊
<7-57,Phoebe>First Chandler, now Joey.

248
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:06,780
<7-58,Monica>-没有钱德勒  只有乔伊  -好吧
<7-58,Monica>- Not Chandler. Just Joey. - Sure.

249
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,000
<8-2,Ross>你知道吗  我想过了
<8-2,Ross>You know what? I've been thinking about it.

250
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,080
<8-3,Rachel>我开始接受萝丝这个名字了
<8-3,Rachel>I'm really coming around on the name Ruth.

251
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:23,300
<8-3,Rachel>我觉得可以考虑帮孩子取那个名字
<8-3,Rachel>I think I would actually consider naming our child that.

252
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:27,480
<8-4,Ross>瑞秋  这对我来说简直意义重大
<8-4,Ross>Rach, I can't tell you how much that means to me.

253
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:32,450
<8-4,Ross>等一下
<8-4,Ross>Wait a minute.

254
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:36,170
<8-4,Ross>等一下  你之前很讨厌萝丝这个名字
<8-4,Ross>Wait a minute. You hated the name Ruth.

255
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:38,800
<8-4,Ross>你为什么会改变心意
<8-4,Ross>Why would you change your mind?

256
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:43,670
<8-4,Ross>除非你知道我们根本用不上它
<8-4,Ross>Unless you know we're never gonna have to use it.

257
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:46,530
<8-4,Ross>你看到病历了  知道自己怀的是男孩
<8-4,Ross>You did see the folder. You know it's a boy!

258
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:47,580
<8-4,Ross>我什么都没有看到
<8-4,Ross>I didn't see anything.

259
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,940
<8-5,Rachel>我真的是改变了心意
<8-5,Rachel>I actually changed my mind about the name.

260
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:53,310
<8-6,Ross>我可不觉得  你答应让我选萝丝
<8-6,Ross>I don't think so. You're giving me Ruth...

261
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:55,780
<8-6,Ross>如果你生了儿子 你就能帮他取名字了
<8-6,Ross>...so you get to name him when it's a boy.

262
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:59,310
<8-6,Ross>到时候你会决定叫他海瑟
<8-6,Ross>That's when you'll swoop in and name him Heath

263
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:02,210
<8-6,Ross>布兰恩或史奎亚
<8-6,Ross>or Blaine or Sequoia.

264
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,800
<8-7,Rachel>我会...史奎亚
<8-7,Rachel>I would... Sequoia!

265
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,450
<8-9,Rachel>-否决  -好吧
<8-9,Rachel>- Veto. - Fine.

266
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,680
<8-10,Ross>除非...
<8-10,Ross>Unless...

267
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:17,890
<8-10,Ross>你知道我会看穿你的阴谋
<8-10,Ross>...you anticipated that I would figure all this out...

268
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:21,430
<8-10,Ross>而你知道自己怀的是女孩
<8-10,Ross>...and you know that it actually is a girl.

269
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,060
<8-10,Ross>你真的希望她叫萝丝
<8-10,Ross>And you really do want her to be named Ruth.

270
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:28,210
<8-10,Ross>我才不会上当  好吧
<8-10,Ross>Well, I'm not falling for that! Okay?

271
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:30,470
<8-10,Ross>不要考虑萝丝了
<8-10,Ross>Ruth is off the table!

272
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,860
<8-11,Rachel>可是你想给孩子取这个名字啊
<8-11,Rachel>But, Ross, you want the name Ruth.

273
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,660
<8-12,Ross>我不会让你得逞
<8-12,Ross>Not like this!

274
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,180
<9-2,Joey>怎么了
<9-2,Joey>What's up?

275
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,330
<9-3,Phoebe>-乔伊  我知道了  -什么
<9-3,Phoebe>- Joey, I know. - What?

276
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:51,370
<9-6,Joey>-我知道了  -什么
<9-6,Joey>- I know. - What?

277
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,940
<9-7,Phoebe>我知道你的心思了
<9-7,Phoebe>I know about your feelings.

278
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,180
<9-8,Joey>天啊  真的吗
<9-8,Joey>Oh, my God, did you?

279
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:01,250
<9-9,Phoebe>对不起  虽然钱德勒跟莫妮卡终成眷属了
<9-9,Phoebe>Yes. I'm sorry. I know things worked out for Chandler and Monica,

280
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,610
<9-9,Phoebe>但那是少之又少的例子
<9-9,Phoebe>but that's rare.

281
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,800
<9-10,Joey>我知道  比起他们的情况
<9-10,Joey>I know. And this is so much more complicated

282
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,980
<9-10,Joey>我的情况复杂多了
<9-10,Joey>than it was for those guys.

283
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,430
<9-10,Joey>她可是瑞秋啊
<9-10,Joey>I mean, it's Rachel, for God's sakes.

284
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,850
<9-11,Phoebe>天啊  是瑞秋
<9-11,Phoebe>For God's sakes, it's Rachel!

285
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:18,890
<9-12,Joey>就是嘛  她不只是我的朋友
<9-12,Joey>I know! She's not only my friend,

286
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:21,060
<9-12,Joey>她还怀孕了
<9-12,Joey>she's my pregnant friend.

287
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:24,120
<9-12,Joey>她不仅怀孕了  还是罗斯的前女友
<9-12,Joey>She's my pregnant friend who's Ross' ex!

288
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,760
<9-13,Phoebe>对  那是瑞秋
<9-13,Phoebe>Yeah, that's Rachel.

289
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,540
<9-13,Phoebe>我哪能比得上她
<9-13,Phoebe>Beat me over the head with it.

290
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:32,250
<9-14,Joey>我该怎么办
<9-14,Joey>What am I gonna do?

291
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:35,360
<9-14,Joey>我努力克服对她的这种感觉
<9-14,Joey>I keep trying to get rid of these feelings.

292
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:36,840
<9-14,Joey>昨晚我整夜没睡
<9-14,Joey>I stayed up all last night

293
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,380
<9-14,Joey>写出所有我不喜欢她的地方
<9-14,Joey>and made a list of everything I don't like about her.

294
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:41,260
<9-14,Joey>-你想听听看吗  -好
<9-14,Joey>- You wanna hear it? - Yeah.

295
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,880
<9-16,Joey>"她要我改吃低卡美乃滋"
<9-16,Joey>"She made me switch to light mayo."

296
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,250
<9-16,Joey>没了  我只想到这点
<9-16,Joey>That's it! That's all I got!

297
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:53,360
<9-16,Joey>其实低卡的味道一样  而且我的裤腰变松了
<9-16,Joey>You know what? Tastes the same and my pants fit better.

298
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,510
<9-17,Phoebe>乔伊  我觉得你是庸人自扰
<9-17,Phoebe>Joey, I think you're getting upset for nothing.

299
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:59,660
<9-17,Phoebe>或许你对她只是一时好感
<9-17,Phoebe>This is probably just a crush.

300
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:01,120
<9-18,Joey>你真的那么觉得吗
<9-18,Joey>You think?

301
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,940
<9-19,Phoebe>没错  你对她顿生好感
<9-19,Phoebe>Absolutely. You get this rush of feelings,

302
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,390
<9-19,Phoebe>但那种感觉会消失
<9-19,Phoebe>but then it goes away.

303
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:08,570
<9-20,Joey>对  我对她只是一时好感
<9-20,Joey>Yeah, just a crush. That's all this is.

304
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:09,960
<9-20,Joey>一时好感
<9-20,Joey>It's a crush!

305
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,800
<9-20,Joey>我是乔伊  我才不会玩真的
<9-20,Joey>I'm Joey. I don't get deep feelings.

306
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,060
<9-21,Phoebe>就是嘛  这种情况经常发生
<9-21,Phoebe>Right. There you go. Crushes happen all the time.

307
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:18,690
<9-21,Phoebe>我对你们三个男生也有过那种感觉
<9-21,Phoebe>I know I've had them for all you guys.

308
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:20,460
<9-21,Phoebe>除了罗斯跟钱德勒
<9-21,Phoebe>Except for Ross and Chandler.

309
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:25,760
<9-21,Phoebe>-我相信你对我们三个也是  -不尽然
<9-21,Phoebe>- And I'm sure you've had them for us. - Not really.

310
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:29,240
<9-23,Phoebe>你就不能可怜可怜我
<9-23,Phoebe>Throw me a bone here.

311
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:41,070
<10-1,Ross>我打电话给医生了
<10-1,Ross>So I called the doctor.

312
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:45,600
<10-1,Ross>现在我们都知道宝宝的性别了
<10-1,Ross>Now we both know the sex of the baby.

313
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:46,570
<10-2,Rachel>什么
<10-2,Rachel>What?

314
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:50,270
<10-3,Ross>没错  我青出于蓝胜于蓝
<10-3,Ross>That's right. The student has become the master.

315
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:54,650
<10-4,Rachel>罗斯  我发誓我真的不知道
<10-4,Rachel>Ross, I swear. I don't know.

316
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:57,020
<10-5,Ross>少来了  你知道是个女孩
<10-5,Ross>Oh, come on, you know it's a girl.

318
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,150
<10-7,Ross>你真的不知道

319
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,980
<10-8,Rachel>-我们要有女儿了  -不
<10-8,Rachel>- We're having a girl? - No.

320
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,050
<10-8,Rachel>-你就是那么说的  -不
<10-8,Rachel>- That's what you said. - No.

321
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:10,290
<10-8,Rachel>-你说是女孩  -是  我真的很抱歉
<10-8,Rachel>- You said girl. - Yes. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

322
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:13,130
<10-8,Rachel>没关系  我们要有女儿了
<10-8,Rachel>I'm not! We're having a girl!

323
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,870
<10-13,Ross>有时候我不敢相信孩子他爸是你
<10-13,Ross>Sometimes I can't believe it's with you,

324
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:18,290
<10-14,Rachel>但我们要有女儿了
<10-14,Rachel>but still, we're having a girl!

325
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:21,260
<10-15,Ross>我知道  你知道吗
<10-15,Ross>I know! You know what?

326
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:23,700
<10-15,Ross>我要重新考虑萝丝这个名字
<10-15,Ross>I'm putting Ruth back on the table.

327
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:26,790
<10-16,Rachel>好  我们要生下小萝丝了
<10-16,Rachel>Yes, we'll have ourselves a little baby Ruth.

329
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,690
<10-17,Ross>-请求否决  -好吧  否决
<10-17,Ross>- Permission to veto. - Yes, please.

330
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,410
<11-2,Chandler>这是精油味吗
<11-2,Chandler>Do I smell essential oils?

331
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,490
<11-3,Monica>对  我要泡澡  我先去拿本杂志
<11-3,Monica>Yeah. I'm gonna take a bath. I was just gonna get a magazine.

332
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:47,590
<11-4,Chandler>好
<11-4,Chandler>Okay.

333
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:05,200
<11-5,Monica>你这是干嘛呢
<11-5,Monica>What do you think you're doing?

334
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:09,220
<11-6,Chandler>忘却烦恼
<11-6,Chandler>Leaving my troubles behind?

335
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,560
<11-7,Monica>我知道你是新手
<11-7,Monica>I know that you're new at this,

336
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,820
<11-7,Monica>但这不合乎泡澡的礼仪
<11-7,Monica>but this is unacceptable bath decorum.

337
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:18,290
<11-8,Chandler>身心如此放松  我还哪顾得上那么多礼仪
<11-8,Chandler>It's so hard to care when you're this relaxed.

338
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,870
<11-9,Monica>好吧  你可以泡澡  但我要拿走你的船
<11-9,Monica>Okay, fine. You can have the bath, but I am taking your boat.

339
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,030
<11-9,Monica>现在你只是个爱洗澡的女生
<11-9,Monica>Now you're just a girl in a tub.

340
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:30,750
<11-11,Phoebe>泡泡浴  太有男子气概了
<11-11,Phoebe>Hi, bubbles. Manly.

341
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,100
<11-11,Phoebe>我想顺道过来
<11-11,Phoebe>I thought I would drop by

342
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,610
<11-11,Phoebe>告诉你我和乔伊的结果
<11-11,Phoebe>and let you know how it went with Joey.

343
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:36,070
<11-12,Chandler>你跟她说了
<11-12,Chandler>You told her?

344
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:38,890
<11-13,Monica>是她自己问出来的
<11-13,Monica>She pulled it out of me!

345
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,250
<11-13,Monica>她真的很会套别人的话
<11-13,Monica>She's like a conversational wizard!

346
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:42,710
<11-13,Monica>结果如何
<11-13,Monica>How did it go?

347
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:45,660
<11-14,Phoebe>-你错了  他不喜欢我  -什么
<11-14,Phoebe>- You were wrong. He doesn't like me. - What?

348
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:49,270
<11-15,Monica>如果我让你去找李·梅杰斯[演员]
<11-15,Monica>Yeah. How would you like it if I sent you to Lee Majors' house...

349
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:51,360
<11-16,Phoebe>我告诉你他喜欢你  结果你跑过去
<11-16,Phoebe>...and I told you he liked you and you went there...

350
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,590
<11-16,Phoebe>发现他根本不喜欢你
<11-16,Phoebe>...and you found out that he didn't like you.

351
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,020
<11-16,Phoebe>你会有什么感觉
<11-16,Phoebe>How would you feel?

352
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,000
<11-17,Monica>我不会在乎
<11-17,Monica>I don't think I'd care.

353
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,280
<11-18,Phoebe>真的吗  李梅杰很性感
<11-18,Phoebe>Really? Lee Majors is hot.

354
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:06,220
<11-20,Phoebe>-有人吗  -我们在浴室里
<11-20,Phoebe>- Hello? - We're in the bathroom!

355
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:11,060
<11-21,Joey>-为什么  -因为现在是放松享受时间
<11-21,Joey>- Why? - Because it's a relaxing and enjoyable time!

356
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:17,820
<11-23,Joey>-你们在这里做什么  -天啊
<11-23,Joey>- What are you guys doing in here? - Oh, my God.

357
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:22,820
<11-24,Monica>他对一个朋友有了不同的感觉  但不是菲比
<11-24,Monica>A friend he's looking at differently, but it's wrong.

358
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:25,140
<11-25,Chandler>-是瑞秋  -你喜欢瑞秋
<11-25,Chandler>- It's Rachel! - You like Rachel?

359
