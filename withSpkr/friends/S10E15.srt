<1-38,Monica>这怎么可能
<1-38,Monica>How's that gonna happen?

<1-39,Chandler>你就是这么使用你的三个魔法愿望的吗
<1-39,Chandler>Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?

84
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,720

85
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:34,540
<2-2,Chandler>再看其它房子只会迷惑自己
<2-2,Chandler>Seeing another house can only confuse us.

86
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:35,830
<2-2,Chandler>我们很容易感到迷惑
<2-2,Chandler>We're easily confused.

87
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,280
<2-2,Chandler>我们并不机灵
<2-2,Chandler>We're not very bright.

88
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,340
<2-3,Monica>那如果它比我们的更好呢
<2-3,Monica>But what if it's better than ours?

89

92
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,540
<2-5,Phoebe>像雪糕餐厅的服务员
<2-5,Phoebe>you should work at a Baskin-Robbins.

93
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,220
<2-5,Phoebe>信不信由你...

<2-10,Phoebe>飞越大西洋的黑人男性
<2-10,Phoebe>to fly solo across the Atlantic!

100

103
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,330
<2-13,Monica>乔伊肯定感到很难过
<2-13,Monica>Joey's gonna be so upset.

104
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,920
<2-14,Chandler>是的  他一直希望成为
<2-14,Chandler>I know. He always wanted to be

105
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:22,380
<2-14,Chandler>第一个独自驾机飞越大西洋的黑人男性
<2-14,Chandler>the first black man to cross the Atlantic.

106
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,080
<2-15,Phoebe>我们不能让乔伊知道这件事
<2-15,Phoebe>We cannot tell Joey about this.

107
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:27,300
<2-15,Phoebe>一切都在改变
<2-15,Phoebe>He's already flipping out

108
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,550
<2-15,Phoebe>他都快要发疯了
<2-15,Phoebe>about everything changing.

109
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,520
<2-15,Phoebe>不能再刺激他了
<2-15,Phoebe>This'll push him over the edge.

110
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,260
<2-16,Monica>你真的认为我们不应该告诉他吗
<2-16,Monica>You don't think we should tell him?

111
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,730
<2-17,Phoebe>至少暂时不说
<2-17,Phoebe>Not for a while.

112
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:34,920
<2-17,Phoebe>给他几天
<2-17,Phoebe>Let's just give him a few days

113
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:36,460
<2-17,Phoebe>先消化已经发生了的事
<2-17,Phoebe>to get used to everything else.

114
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,200
<2-18,Monica>如果他从报纸上看到呢
<2-18,Monica>What if he reads the paper?

115
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,810
<2-19,Chandler>除非是八卦的史努比告诉查理·布朗
<2-19,Chandler>Unless Snoopy says it to Charlie Brown,

116
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,240
<2-19,Chandler>否则就没问题

<3-2,Ross>我们两年前在圣诞派对上见过面
<3-2,Ross>Actually, we met at the Christmas party about two years ago.

120
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:58,610
<3-3,Mr Zelner>-哦  是唐   -差不多  是罗恩

123
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:08,230
<3-6,Ross>能不能恢复瑞秋的工作
<3-6,Ross>if you'll give Rachel her job back.

124
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,260
<3-7,Mr Zelner>是她让你来的吗
<3-7,Mr Zelner>Did she ask you to come here and do this?

125
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:13,430
<3-8,Ross>不  如果你同意了
<3-8,Ross>First I have to get you to agree...

126
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,400
<3-8,Ross>我还要问问她是否愿意回来
<3-8,Ross>...then we'll see if she wants to come back.

127
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,900
<3-9,Mr Zelner>哇  这真吸引人
<3-9,Mr Zelner>Wow, that is tempting.

128
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:22,570
<3-10,Ross>她很喜欢这份工作
<3-10,Ross>She loved her job here.

129
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,860
<3-10,Ross>实际上  你找不到比她更好的人选
<3-10,Ross>Let's face it, you're not gonna find anyone...

130
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:27,300
<3-10,Ross>是这样吗
<3-10,Ross>...who did it as well as she did. Isn't that true?

131
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:30,970
<3-12,Ross>-是很不错   -我真没料到
<3-12,Ross>- She is good. - I took a shot there.

132
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:34,440
<3-13,Mr Zelner>可是  很抱歉  我无能为力
<3-13,Mr Zelner>But I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do.

133
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,550
<3-13,Mr Zelner>事实是  我不想出力
<3-13,Mr Zelner>Oh, that's not true. There's nothing I want to do.

134
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:40,350
<3-13,Mr Zelner>好的
<3-13,Mr Zelner>I see.

135
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,110
<3-14,Ross>非常谢谢
<3-14,Ross>Thanks very much.

136
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:51,280
<3-15,Mr Zelner>-是你儿子吗   -对  他叫罗斯
<3-15,Mr Zelner>- Is this your son? - Yeah, his name is Ross.

137
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,660
<3-15,Mr Zelner>怎么了
<3-15,Mr Zelner>What?

138
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:00,090
<3-16,Ross>没什么  跟罗恩发音很接近嘛
<3-16,Ross>Nothing, it's just that it's close to Ron.

139
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:06,470
<3-16,Ross>这小罗斯有可能对恐龙有兴趣吗
<3-16,Ross>Does little Ross like dinosaurs, by any chance?

140
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:08,790
<3-17,Mr Zelner>是的  他老是说起  那又怎么样
<3-17,Mr Zelner>Yeah, they're all he talks about. Why?

141
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,010
<3-18,Ross>他是否愿意
<3-18,Ross>How would he like to

142
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:15,420
<3-18,Ross>和我到自然历史博物馆
<3-18,Ross>come with me to the Museum of Natural History...

143
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:17,050
<3-18,Ross>在其他人都离开之后
<3-18,Ross>...after everyone else has left,

144
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,590
<3-18,Ross>就剩我们两个
<3-18,Ross>just the two of us...

145
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,680
<3-18,Ross>他想摸哪里就摸哪里
<3-18,Ross>...and he can touch anything he wants?

146
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,300
<3-18,Ross>我说的话  我自己也听到了  有歧义了
<3-18,Ross>I just heard it how you must have heard it, and that's not good.

147
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:33,270
<3-18,Ross>让我再说一遍   我是古生物学家
<3-18,Ross>Let me start again. I'm a paleontologist.

148
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:38,800
<3-18,Ross>你也可以在场  摸的只会是骨头...化石
<3-18,Ross>You'll be there with us, and the touching refers only to bones-- fossils!

149
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:43,870
<3-19,Mr Zelner>你真的可以安排到吗
<3-19,Mr Zelner>You could really arrange that?

150
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:46,660
<3-20,Ross>如果你能让瑞秋回来  那就这么定了
<3-20,Ross>You let Rachel come back and it's done.

151
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:51,030
<3-21,Mr Zelner>我想  让瑞秋回来  不见得就是坏事
<3-21,Mr Zelner>I guess having Rachel back wouldn't be the worst thing in the world.

152
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:54,250
<3-22,Ross>太好了  十分感谢
<3-22,Ross>Yes! Thank you! This is great! Thank you so much.

153
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,870
<3-22,Ross>我保证  这是你的孩子会高兴死的
<3-22,Ross>I swear, your kid's gonna have the time of his life.

154
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,450
<3-23,Mr Zelner>太好了  我对他挺担心的
<3-23,Mr Zelner>That's great. I worry about little Ross.

155
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:00,080
<3-23,Mr Zelner>他老是捧著书本
<3-23,Mr Zelner>He's always reading,

156
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,340
<3-23,Mr Zelner>收集石头  完全被恐龙给迷住了
<3-23,Mr Zelner>collecting rocks and he's obsessed with dinosaurs.

157
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,410
<3-24,Ross>他会正常的
<3-24,Ross>He'll be fine!

158
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,400
<4-1,Joey>- 嘿  菲比  - 嘿
<4-1,Joey>- Hey, Pheebs. - Hey.

159
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,000
<4-2,Phoebe>你怎么了
<4-2,Phoebe>Everything okay?

160
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:11,650
<4-3,Joey>我在生我经纪人的气
<4-3,Joey>I'm just mad at my agent.

161
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,250
<4-4,Phoebe>艾丝特尔  为什么
<4-4,Phoebe>Estelle? Why?

162
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:17,060
<4-5,Joey>有一部电视电影 其中的角色很合适我演
<4-5,Joey>There's a part in this TV movie that I would be perfect for...

163
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:20,410
<4-5,Joey>她没有推荐我去  她最好有个好的借口
<4-5,Joey>...and I didn't even get put up for it. She better have a good reason.

164
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,830
<4-6,Phoebe>我想她有的
<4-6,Phoebe>I'm guessing she does.

165
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:27,570
<4-7,Joey>我想听听  她老是这样
<4-7,Joey>Well, I wanna hear it, because she keeps doing this.

166
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:31,150
<4-8,Phoebe>噢  等等  我要先走了
<4-8,Phoebe>No, wait, wait, wait! All right, I gotta go.

167
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:35,010
<4-8,Phoebe>答应我  等一会再打给她
<4-8,Phoebe>Just listen. Promise me that you will wait a minute before you call her.

168
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:36,780
<4-9,Joey>为什么
<4-9,Joey>Well, okay. Why?

169
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:42,720
<4-10,Phoebe>因为  朋友之间的诺言  从不需要有原因
<4-10,Phoebe>Because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason.

170
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:49,160
<4-11,Joey>我喜欢这句话
<4-11,Joey>I love that saying!

171
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:00,730
<4-12,Joey>-嗨   -乔伊  我是艾丝特尔
<4-12,Joey>- Hello? - Joey, it's Estelle.

172
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:04,930
<4-13,Joey>我正想打电话给你  真古怪
<4-13,Joey>I was just gonna call you. That's weird.

173
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:08,420
<4-13,Joey>这是巧合  但是可信
<4-13,Joey>It's a little coincidental, but believable.

174
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:12,530
<4-13,Joey>我想你肯定想知道
<4-13,Joey>Listen, I'm sure you're wondering

175
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,620
<4-14,Joey>我为什么没有安排你
<4-14,Joey>why I didn't get you...

176
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,230
<4-14,Joey>为那部电视电影试镜
<4-14,Joey>...an audition for that TV movie.

177
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,690
<4-14,Joey>是的  确实是的
<4-14,Joey>Yeah, actually I am.

178
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,690
<3-21,Mr Zelner>我想我失职了
<3-21,Mr Zelner>I guess I dropped the ball there.

179
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,350
<4-14,Joey>就这样
<4-14,Joey>That's it?

180
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,350
<4-15,Joey>我最近老是失职
<4-15,Joey>You know, it seems like all you do lately is drop the ball.

181
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:28,490
<4-15,Joey>不要这么和我说话
<4-15,Joey>Don't take that tone with me.

182
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,830
<4-15,Joey>你以为自己是谁
<4-15,Joey>Who do you think you are?

183
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,750
<4-15,Joey>阿兰·莱蒙
<4-15,Joey>Alan Lemon,

184
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,420
<4-16,Joey>第一个独自驾机飞越大西洋的黑人男性
<4-16,Joey>the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic?

185
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:39,540
<4-16,Joey>听我说  你是我的经纪人
<4-16,Joey>No, look, all I'm saying is you're my agent...

186
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:41,560
<4-16,Joey>但是你没有为我争取到试镜机会
<4-16,Joey>...and you're not getting me any auditions

187
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:42,630
<4-16,Joey>我受够了
<4-16,Joey>and I'm tired of it.

188
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,990
<4-16,Joey>你这样说什么意思
<4-16,Joey>What are you saying?

189
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:48,150
<4-17,Joey>我意思是  不能再这样了  艾丝特尔
<4-17,Joey>I'm saying that this isn't working for me anymore, okay, Estelle?

190
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,670
<4-17,Joey>你被解雇了  再见
<4-17,Joey>You're fired. Goodbye.

191
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,980
<4-18,Phoebe>噢  艾丝特尔这个星期真倒霉
<4-18,Phoebe>Man, tough week for Estelle.

192
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,690
<5-1,Ross>-嗨  -嗨
<5-1,Ross>- Hi. - Hi.

193
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,900
<5-3,Ross>艾玛把这忘在我那了
<5-3,Ross>Emma left her stuffed T. Rex at my house.

194
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:04,740
<5-3,Ross>没这她可睡不着哦
<5-3,Ross>You know she can't sleep without it.

195
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:06,990
<5-4,Rachel>嗯  她现在在睡觉呢
<5-4,Rachel>Well, she's asleep now.

196
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,750
<5-4,Rachel>别再塞这玩意儿给她
<5-4,Rachel>Stop forcing that thing on her.

197
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,720
<5-5,Ross>好的
<5-5,Ross>Okay.

198
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,210
<5-6,Rachel>哦  你绝对不会相信今天发生的事
<5-6,Rachel>You're not gonna believe what happened to me today!

199
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:17,500
<5-6,Rachel>拉夫·劳伦公司打电话请我回去
<5-6,Rachel>Ralph Lauren called and gave me my job back!

200
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:21,910
<5-8,Rachel>-不会吧   -好奇怪啊
<5-8,Rachel>- No! - I mean, it was the weirdest thing.

201
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,040
<5-8,Rachel>他们先是解雇我  然后又无缘无故重新聘用我
<5-8,Rachel>They fire me and then out of nowhere, they just hire me back.

202
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:27,840
<5-8,Rachel>一定是没我就不行了
<5-8,Rachel>I mean, that place must just be falling apart without me!

203
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:29,870
<5-9,Ross>那么  你不去巴黎了吧
<5-9,Ross>So you're not going to Paris?

204
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,560
<5-10,Rachel>去呀  我还去
<5-10,Rachel>No, I'm still going!

205
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,770
<5-11,Ross>什么...
<5-11,Ross>What?

206
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:40,850
<5-12,Rachel>好吧  当路易威登公司发现
<5-12,Rachel>Well, when the Louis Vuitton people found out...

207
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,590
<5-12,Rachel>拉夫·劳伦公司请我回去
<5-12,Rachel>...that Ralph Lauren wanted me back,

208
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,460
<5-12,Rachel>他们就提高了我的报酬
<5-12,Rachel>they offered me more money!

209
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:46,130
<5-12,Rachel>罗斯  是不是太棒了
<5-12,Rachel>Ross, isn't that great?

210
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:58,610
<5-12,Rachel>我们有意买下旁边的那座房子
<5-12,Rachel>Hi. We're buying the house next door.

211
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,470
<6-1,Monica>允许我们参观一下这里吗
<6-1,Monica>Could we just take a look around?

212
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,170
<12-24,Ross>当然可以
<12-24,Ross>Sure,

213
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,460
<6-1,Monica>我刚好带人来参观
<6-1,Monica>I'm showing it to someone else right now,

214
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:04,060
<6-2,Lady>你们进来吧
<6-2,Lady>but please, look around.

215
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:07,230
<6-4,Chandler>我感到这是对我们房子的不忠
<6-4,Chandler>I feel like we're cheating on our house.

216
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,130
<6-1,Monica>如果不忠的话  我们不也应该
<6-1,Monica>If we cheat, shouldn't it

217
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,530
<6-4,Chandler>一些事情老房子不会做
<6-4,Chandler>be with a hot, younger house...

218
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,610
<6-4,Chandler>一个会做的年轻漂亮的房子来不忠吗
<6-4,Chandler>...that does stuff that our house won't do?

219
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:18,040
<6-5,Monica>我们的比这里更棒
<6-5,Monica>Ours is so much better!

220
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:20,010
<6-5,Monica>客厅更小
<6-5,Monica>This living room is smaller,

221
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:22,260
<6-5,Monica>饭厅像个洞穴
<6-5,Monica>the dining room looks like a cave.

222
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:23,710
<6-5,Monica>真受不了
<6-5,Monica>What a hole!

223
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,460
<6-6,Lady>-你们觉得怎么样   -喜欢
<6-6,Lady>- So, what do you think? - Love it!

224
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,770
<6-7,Monica>我们本来有一位买家
<6-7,Monica>We already have one offer.

225
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,910
<6-8,Lady>楼上的女士是另一位
<6-8,Lady>I think the lady upstairs will make another one.

226
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,000
<6-9,Monica>是我们将来的邻居  他们是什么样的
<6-9,Monica>They could be our neighbors. What are they like?

227
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,570
<6-10,Lady>楼上这位女士很好
<6-10,Lady>The woman upstairs is nice.

228
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,230
<6-10,Lady>她和丈夫有2个小孩
<6-10,Lady>She and her husband have two kids.

229
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,460
<6-10,Lady>丈夫在华尔街工作  她是...
<6-10,Lady>He's on Wall Street, and she's a--

230
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:42,460
<6-11,Janice>哦...天...啊...
<6-11,Janice>Oh... my... God!

231
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:53,760
<6-11,Janice>没错
<6-11,Janice>Sure.

232
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,180
<7-1,Phoebe>乔伊  你想和我去...
<7-1,Phoebe>Hey, Joey, you wanna come with me to--?

233
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:04,010
<7-1,Phoebe>你怎么啦
<7-1,Phoebe>Are you okay?

234
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,470
<7-2,Joey>我为解雇艾丝特尔的事难过
<7-2,Joey>Yeah, I just feel bad about firing Estelle.

235
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,190
<7-2,Joey>她肯定伤心死了
<7-2,Joey>This has gotta be killing her.

236
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:14,480
<7-3,Phoebe>她不会因此死的
<7-3,Phoebe>No, that wouldn't kill her.

237
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,170
<7-3,Phoebe>冠状动脉栓塞有可能
<7-3,Phoebe>A coronary embolism might.

238
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,670
<7-4,Joey>她心都碎了  我是她唯一的客户
<7-4,Joey>I don't know. She's gotta be taking it hard. I was her only client.

239
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:24,130
<7-4,Joey>那个会吃纸的家伙除外
<7-4,Joey>Except for this guy who eats paper.

240
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,500
<7-4,Joey>我猜他吃的钱比挣得多
<7-4,Joey>And I'm guessing he eats more money than he makes.

241
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,440
<7-4,Joey>我明白她不是优秀的经纪人
<7-4,Joey>Look, I know she's not a great agent,

242
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:31,420
<7-4,Joey>但我们合作10年了
<7-4,Joey>but she did stick with me for 10 years.

243
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,870
<7-4,Joey>我要给她打电话  重新雇佣她
<7-4,Joey>I'm gonna call her and hire her again.

244
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,010
<7-5,Phoebe>不...  不要给她打电话
<7-5,Phoebe>No, no, no! Don't call her.

245
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:40,930
<7-5,Phoebe>-你等她给你打电话   -为什么
<7-5,Phoebe>- You wait for her to call you. - Why?

246
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:44,970
<7-7,Phoebe>耐心是通向理解的大道
<7-7,Phoebe>Because patience is the road to understanding.

247
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,300
<7-7,Phoebe>那是得到快乐的关键
<7-7,Phoebe>Which is the key to a happy heart.

248
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,680
<7-8,Joey>你真让人吃惊  我服了
<7-8,Joey>You blow me away.

249
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,880
<7-9,Phoebe>答应我  你等她给你打电话
<7-9,Phoebe>All right, so promise you're gonna wait for her to call you?

250
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:00,240
<7-10,Joey>-我答应你   -好的
<7-10,Joey>- I promise. - Okay.

251
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:03,900
<7-10,Joey>这意味着  从不需要有原因
<7-10,Joey>And that means never having to give a reason.

252
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,480
<8-1,Janice>这世界真小呀
<8-1,Janice>What a small world!

253
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,110
<8-2,Chandler>我还没碰到过碧昂丝
<8-2,Chandler>And yet I never run into Beyonce.

254
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,970
<8-3,Realtor>你们认识
<8-3,Realtor>You two know each other?

255
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,460
<8-4,Janice>我们是老交情了
<8-4,Janice>We go way back.

256
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:20,580
<8-4,Janice>在莫妮卡认识他之前
<8-4,Janice>Before Monica made an honest man out of him...

257
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:25,150
<8-4,Janice>钱德勒曾经是我的小甜甜
<8-4,Janice>...Chandler used to be my little love muffin.

258
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,890
<8-4,Janice>这么说  你们也要想买下一座房子
<8-4,Janice>So are you guys thinking of getting this house too?

259
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,680
<8-4,Janice>如果是要投标竞价的话
<8-4,Janice>Are we gonna have a bidding war?

260
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:32,810
<8-4,Janice>我可要警告你了  我是流氓我怕谁
<8-4,Janice>I better warn you, I'm a toughie.

261
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:33,760
<8-5,Chandler>别...
<8-5,Chandler>Don't...

262
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,040
<8-5,Chandler>别这样
<8-5,Chandler>Don't do that.

263
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,840
<8-6,Monica>其实我们打算买下隔壁那座房子
<8-6,Monica>No, actually, we are buying the house next door.

264
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:39,500
<8-7,Chandler>为什么
<8-7,Chandler>Why?

265
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,160
<8-8,Monica>我不知道为什么
<8-8,Monica>I don't know why.

266
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:48,630
<8-9,Janice>那就这么定了   本来我还在犹豫
<8-9,Janice>Oh, that decides it, then! I was on the fence.

267
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,350
<8-9,Janice>没想到我们会成为邻居
<8-9,Janice>But knowing that you two would be our neighbors?

268
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,080
<8-9,Janice>那我就买下来了
<8-9,Janice>Now we have to get it!

269
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:56,350
<8-9,Janice>艾伦  我们去定下价钱
<8-9,Janice>Ellen, we're gonna talk numbers.

270
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:02,910
<8-10,Chandler>怎么会搞成这样
<8-10,Chandler>This cannot be happening.

271
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,830
<8-11,Monica>经纪人不是说还有 另外一对夫妇有意购买吗
<8-11,Monica>The realtor said another couple made an offer.

272
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,050
<8-11,Monica>珍妮斯可能就买不成了
<8-11,Monica>Maybe the Janices won't get it!

273
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:10,670
<8-11,Monica>另外的夫妇可能会买下
<8-11,Monica>Maybe the other couple will.

274
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,390
<8-12,Chandler>这绝不可能发生
<8-12,Chandler>The only way that'll happen is

275
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,690
<8-12,Chandler>除非那是希特勒夫妇
<8-12,Chandler>if the other couple are the Hitlers!

276
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,890
<8-13,Monica>我们两座房子都买下来  怎么样
<8-13,Monica>Okay, okay! All right, what if we get both houses?

277
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,070
<8-13,Monica>将这里作为家庭旅馆
<8-13,Monica>We can turn this one into a guesthouse!

278
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,490
<8-14,Chandler>真是好主意
<8-14,Chandler>That's a great idea!

279
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,650
<8-14,Chandler>我不是想招讨厌
<8-14,Chandler>By the way, I don't mean to sound distasteful...

280
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,020
<8-14,Chandler>但你从什么时候开始爱乱花钱了
<8-14,Chandler>...but when did you start crapping money?

281
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:32,730
<8-15,Monica>-好呀  那你来想办法  -好啊
<8-15,Monica>- You come up with an idea. - All right.

282
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:36,010
<8-16,Chandler>还有3个小时才签约
<8-16,Chandler>We've still got three hours till escrow closes on our house.

283
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,520
<8-16,Chandler>我们现在取消还来得及
<8-16,Chandler>We can still get out.

284
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:38,740
<8-17,Monica>我们喜欢这座房子
<8-17,Monica>But we love our house.

285
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,620
<8-18,Chandler>你也同样喜欢住在她隔壁吗
<8-18,Chandler>Will we love it so much with her next door?

286
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,740
<8-18,Chandler>她还会在这大声嚷嚷
<8-18,Chandler>And she's gonna be louder out here too!

287
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:45,980
<8-18,Chandler>讨厌的"噢...天...啊..."
<8-18,Chandler>Just the crickets and, "Oh... my... God!"

288
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,460
<8-19,Monica>即使我们不买这座房子
<8-19,Monica>Okay. But if we don't get this house,

289
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,440
<8-19,Monica>她还是会在我们面前出现
<8-19,Monica>she'll still show up wherever we go.

290
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:52,340
<8-19,Monica>她住在这
<8-19,Monica>At least if she's here,

291
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:54,610
<8-19,Monica>起码不会再吓我们一跳
<8-19,Monica>it eliminates the element of surprise.

292
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:57,190
<8-19,Monica>你不会再听到那3个字
<8-19,Monica>Never again will you have to hear the three words...

293
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,900
<8-19,Monica>连你的蛋蛋都被吓得缩进去
<8-19,Monica>...that make your balls jump back up inside your body!

294
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:07,720
<8-20,Chandler>我们得想想办法
<8-20,Chandler>Well, we have to do something.

295
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:09,590
<8-20,Chandler>不能就让她住在隔壁
<8-20,Chandler>We can't have her living next door.

296
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,100
<8-20,Chandler>嗯  这也会
<8-20,Chandler>Oh, that does it too.

297
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,220
<9-1,r Zelner>谁
<9-1,r Zelner>Who is it?

298
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:26,110
<9-2,Ross>是我  罗恩
<9-2,Ross>It's me. Ron.

299
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,800
<9-2,Ross>我知道瑞秋拒绝你了
<9-2,Ross>Look, I know Rachel turned you down...

300
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:34,550
<9-2,Ross>不过我有一个法子能让她会来
<9-2,Ross>...but I think there's a way you might be able to get her to come back.

301
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,460
<9-3,Mr Zelner>请你别见怪
<9-3,Mr Zelner>This may surprise you,

302
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:40,300
<9-3,Mr Zelner>重新聘用已经解雇的员工  不是我主要的工作
<9-3,Mr Zelner>but rehiring fired employees is not my main job.

303
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,810
<9-4,Ross>先听我说
<9-4,Ross>Just hear me out.

304
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:46,870
<9-4,Ross>给她提高薪酬  你认为怎么样
<9-4,Ross>How would you feel about offering her a raise?

305
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:53,440
<9-5,Mr Zelner>不好  罗恩
<9-5,Mr Zelner>Not good, Ron.

306
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:56,860
<9-6,Ross>可能我会说服你
<9-6,Ross>Perhaps I can persuade you.

307
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,690
<9-6,Ross>你希望送给你儿子
<9-6,Ross>What if you could give your son...

308
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:05,430
<9-6,Ross>这么一只恐龙蛋复制品吗
<9-6,Ross>...this genuine pterodactyl egg replica.

309
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:15,070
<9-7,Mr Zelner>哇  这很不错呀
<9-7,Mr Zelner>Wow! That's pretty cool.

310
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:18,980
<9-8,Ross>这么说  我们成交了
<9-8,Ross>So? Do we have a deal?

311
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:22,880
<9-9,Mr Zelner>-好的  你成功了  -太好了

<9-11,Mr Zelner>这会让我很受欢迎
<9-11,Mr Zelner>This is gonna make me very popular.

313
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,470
<9-12,Ross>相信我  女士都喜欢它
<9-12,Ross>Believe me, the ladies, they love it.

314
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,810
<9-13,Mr Zelner>我指的是我儿子
<9-13,Mr Zelner>I meant with my son.

315
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:37,690
<9-14,Ross>对  女士对它不感兴趣
<9-14,Ross>Good, because the ladies, not so much.

316
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,460
<10-1,Answering machine>乔伊  我是阿尔·则布克  那个吃纸的人
<10-1,Answering machine>Joey, this is Al Zebooker, the guy who eats paper.

327
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,460
<10-7,Phoebe>我觉得我不应该贸然造访
<10-7,Phoebe>I didn't think I should just drop by.

328
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:44,070
<10-8,Joey>不  不要来访
<10-8,Joey>No, no! Don't drop by! Don't drop by!

00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:26,410
<11-1,Janice>一定会成功的
<11-1,Janice>And I'll bet we get it!

340
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:28,690
<11-2,Chandler>希特勒夫妇肯定会很失望
<11-2,Chandler>The Hitlers will be so disappointed.

341

<11-3,Janice>我要先走了  帮我跟莫妮卡说再见
<11-3,Janice>All right, I gotta run. Tell Monica I say goodbye.

354
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:15,560
<11-10,Chandler>珍妮斯·利特曼·高妮科·尼豪金斯丁
<11-10,Chandler>Janice Litman-Goralnik ne Hosenstein.

355
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:22,830
<11-11,Janice>钱德勒  你在说什么啊
<11-11,Janice>Chandler, what are you talking about?

<11-12,Chandler>你现在住在隔壁  我们会每天在一起
<11-12,Chandler>Now that you live next door, we can be together every day.

357
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:29,070
<11-12,Chandler>西德和莫妮卡根本不会察觉
<11-12,Chandler>Sid and Monica never have to know a thing.

358
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:31,380
<11-13,Janice>我不知道该说什么
<11-13,Janice>I don't know what to say.

359
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:38,830
<11-13,Janice>很显然  我们之间还有热情
<11-13,Janice>I mean, you know, obviously we have this heat between us.

360
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,250
<11-14,Chandler>很显然

00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,710
<11-15,Janice>但我爱我的丈夫
<11-15,Janice>But I love my husband.

00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:51,490
<11-15,Janice>我也知道你爱你的妻子
<11-15,Janice>And I know you love your wife.

363
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:54,710
<11-15,Janice>我现在认为我不应该买这座房子
<11-15,Janice>I don't think we should get this house now.

364

<11-19,Janice>尽管
<11-19,Janice>Although....

368
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:12,430
<11-19,Janice>最后就软弱一次吧
<11-19,Janice>Maybe just one last moment of weakness.

00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:27,760
<12-15,Rachel>我本来是盼望着去巴黎的吗  当然
<12-15,Rachel>But, you know, I mean, was I looking forward to going to Paris? Sure.

386
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,230
<12-15,Rachel>为能在时尚之都工作而感到兴奋
<12-15,Rachel>Was I excited about working in the fashion capital of the world?

<12-15,Rachel>一个为之付出所有努力的工作
<12-15,Rachel>...gotten everything out of it that I possibly can.

00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,500
<12-16,Ross>我不知道
<12-16,Ross>I had no idea--

392

00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:15,270
<12-17,Rachel>当我发现怀上艾玛时  我感到害怕
<12-17,Rachel>Or "when I found out I was gonna have Emma" scared.

397
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,580
<12-17,Rachel>这很不错啦  能行的
