<4-4,Rachel>不过我们倒是很想看你再摘一次手套
<4-4,Rachel>Although we would love to see you do that again.

124
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,520
<4-8,Ross>我能陪在你身边
<4-8,Ross>the kicking for the first time.

<4-10,Ross>我随时恭候  凌晨三点也无所谓
<4-10,Ross>I'll be there. I don't care if it's three in the morning,

130
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,900
<4-10,Ross>哪怕你只是想吃冰淇淋
<4-10,Ross>and all you want is ice cream.

131
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,460
<4-11,Joey>我能抄一份吗
<4-11,Joey>Can I get a copy of that?

132
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:26,730
<5-1,Phoebe>-你裹上床单吗  -对
<5-1,Phoebe>- Are you under the sheet? - Yes.

133
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,250
<5-3,Phoebe>好了  我们开始吧
<5-3,Phoebe>Great, let's begin.

134
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,310
<5-3,Phoebe>力道还可以吧
<5-3,Phoebe>How's the pressure?

135
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:46,360
<5-4,Monica>很不错  菲比  你确实很厉害
<5-4,Monica>It's nice. Wow, Phoebe, you are good.

136
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:48,780
<5-5,Phoebe>这是明摆着的事  不过还是谢谢夸奖
<5-5,Phoebe>Stating the obvious, but thank you.

137
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,620
<5-5,Phoebe>-一点都不奇怪  对吧  -没错
<5-5,Phoebe>- And it's not weird, is it? - No.

138
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,830
<5-7,Phoebe>没错  好好享受吧
<5-7,Phoebe>That's right, you just enjoy.

139
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,620
<5-8,Monica>爽
<5-8,Monica>Oh, yeah!

140
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:12,110
<5-8,Monica>-爽啊  -好吧
<5-8,Monica>- Oh, yeah! - Okay.

141
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:16,090
<5-10,Monica>天啊  菲比
<5-10,Monica>Oh, God, Phoebe!

142
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,100
<5-10,Monica>就这样  就是那里
<5-10,Monica>That's it! That's it, right there!

143
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,470
<6-1,Chandler>我没想打开你的储藏室
<6-1,Chandler>I wasn't trying to open your closet.

144
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:36,570
<6-1,Chandler>我发誓  我没想打开你的储藏室
<6-1,Chandler>I wasn't trying to open your closet, I swear.

145
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:41,460
<6-2,Joey>莫妮卡管你很严  对吧
<6-2,Joey>Monica runs a pretty tight ship here, doesn't she?

146
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:44,090
<6-2,Joey>你在做什么
<6-2,Joey>What are you doing?

147
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:47,010
<6-3,Chandler>莫妮卡有个秘密储藏室  她不肯让我看
<6-3,Chandler>Monica has a secret closet. She won't let me see what's in it.

148
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,230
<6-4,Joey>-为什么  -我不知道
<6-4,Joey>- Why not? - I don't know!

149
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:51,400
<6-5,Chandler>她能有什么要藏着不让我看的
<6-5,Chandler>What could she possibly be hiding in here that I can't see?!

150
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,040
<6-6,Joey>我不知道
<6-6,Joey>I don't know.

151
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,880
<6-6,Joey>我敢说是理查德
<6-6,Joey>I bet it's Richard.

152
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,450
<6-7,Chandler>她为什么要把理查德关在里面
<6-7,Chandler>Why would Monica be keeping Richard in here?

153
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:03,090
<6-8,Joey>我的第一反应是
<6-8,Joey>Off the top of my head...

154
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:06,620
<6-8,Joey>或者她想鱼与熊掌兼得
<6-8,Joey>...maybe she's having her cake and eating it too.

155
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,810
<6-8,Joey>你是"熊掌"  理查德只是"鱼"
<6-8,Joey>You being the "cake," Richard being the "too."

156
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:12,970
<6-9,Chandler>-或是...  -又来了
<6-9,Chandler>- Or... - And here we go.

157
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,200
<6-10,Joey>我看过一部电影里有一扇门
<6-10,Joey>I saw this movie once where there was a door

158
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,900
<6-10,Joey>没有人知道里面藏了什么
<6-10,Joey>Nobody knew what was behind it.

159
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,610
<6-10,Joey>最后他们把门打开之后
<6-10,Joey>When they finally got it open,

160
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:23,870
<6-10,Joey>数以百万只虫子蜂拥而出
<6-10,Joey>millions and millions and millions of bugs came pouring out

161
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:26,260
<6-10,Joey>以人肉为食
<6-10,Joey>and they feasted on human flesh.

162
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,050
<6-10,Joey>尊重你老婆的隐私要不了你的命
<6-10,Joey>It wouldn't kill you to respect your wife's privacy!

163
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:38,880
<6-10,Joey>满是虫子的破储藏室
<6-10,Joey>Stupid closet full of bugs!

164
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,500
<6-11,Rachel>乔伊  我感觉怪怪的  不太对头
<6-11,Rachel>Joey. Joey, something feels weird and not good weird.

165
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:46,100
<6-11,Rachel>我不...
<6-11,Rachel>I don't...

166
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,940
<6-12,Joey>别担心  没事
<6-12,Joey>Do not worry, ok?

167
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,110
<6-12,Joey>我妹妹怀孕的时候
<6-12,Joey>When my sisters were pregnant...

168
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,110
<6-12,Joey>她们有各种奇怪的感觉
<6-12,Joey>they got every weird feeling in the book,

169
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:52,030
<6-12,Joey>结果根本没事
<6-12,Joey>and it was always nothing.

170
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:53,270
<6-13,Rachel>-真的吗  -没错
<6-13,Rachel>- Really? - Absolutely.

171
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,510
<6-14,Joey>但我们得到医院检查一下  确保没事
<6-14,Joey>But we'll stop by the hospital just to be sure.

172
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:58,820
<6-14,Joey>-我在路上呼罗斯  -好
<6-14,Joey>- I'll page Ross on the way. - Okay. God!

173
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,810
<6-16,Joey>瑞秋  看着我
<6-16,Joey>Okay Rach, Rach, Rach look at me, look at me,

174
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:03,160
<6-16,Joey>一切都会没事的  相信我
<6-16,Joey>everything's gonna be fine, trust me. Okay.

175
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,760
<6-16,Joey>来  握着我的手  我们走吧
<6-16,Joey>Come on. Take my hand. Here we go.

176
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:06,760
<6-16,Joey>我快骨折了
<6-16,Joey>Crushing bones!

177
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:09,540
<6-16,Joey>还好我们是要去医院
<6-16,Joey>Good thing we're going to a hospital.

178
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:20,900
<7-1,Joey>-怎么样  -她没事
<7-1,Joey>- So? - She's fine.

179
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:23,120
<7-2,Dr. Long>她出现了假性子宫收缩
<7-2,Dr. Long>She's experiencing Braxton-Hicks contractions,

180
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,000
<7-2,Dr. Long>引起了子宫壁的轻度不适
<7-2,Dr. Long>mild discomfort caused by contractions in the uterine wall.

181
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,510
<7-3,Rachel>轻度不适
<7-3,Rachel>Mild discomfort?

182
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,400
<7-3,Rachel>这么说你也出现过假性宫缩喽
<7-3,Rachel>So I take it you've had one of these Braxton thingies?

183
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,220
<7-4,Joey>-一切都正常吗  -对
<7-4,Joey>- But everything's normal? - Absolutely.

184
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,880
<7-6,Joey>-她和宝宝都没有危险  -对
<7-6,Joey>- And there's no danger to her or the baby? - No.

185
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,120
<7-7,Dr. Long>如果不明情况  宫缩会引起不安情绪
<7-7,Dr. Long>Contractions can be unnerving if you don't know what they are,

186
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,110
<7-7,Dr. Long>但她没事
<7-7,Dr. Long>but she's fine.

187
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,540
<7-8,Rachel>谢谢你  医生
<7-8,Rachel>Thank you, doctor.

188
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:44,140
<7-8,Rachel>谢谢你这么好心冷静
<7-8,Rachel>And thank you for being nice and calm.

189
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,790
<7-9,Joey>我一点都不冷静
<7-9,Joey>Calm? I wasn't calm!

190
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:48,090
<7-9,Joey>我从来没有这么害怕过
<7-9,Joey>I've never been more scared in my entire life.

191
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,900
<7-10,Rachel>你说一切都会没事的
<7-10,Rachel>But wait you said everything was gonna be okay.

192
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,500
<7-11,Joey>我知道什么  我又不是医生
<7-11,Joey>What do I know? I'm not a doctor.

193
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,720
<7-12,Rachel>-但一切都没事  我很好啊  -你确定
<7-12,Rachel>- But everything is okay. I'm fine. - You sure?

194
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,810
<7-13,Joey>对  我真希望那个医生的子宫也会收缩
<7-13,Joey>Yes. I got half a mind to contract that doctor's uterus though.

195
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:04,570
<7-14,Rachel>轻度不适  他没经历过  有什么资格发言
<7-14,Rachel>Mild discomfort! What's he talking about?

196
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:07,050
<7-16,Ross>-你没事吧  -没事
<7-16,Ross>- Is everything okay? - Yes, everything's fine.

197
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:10,110
<7-18,Ross>你呼我说"赶到医院来"  发生了什么事
<7-18,Ross>Your page said, "Come to the hospital." What happened?

198
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:13,410
<7-19,Joey>她出现了假性子宫收缩
<7-19,Joey>Something called Braxton Hicks contraction.

199
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:16,420
<7-19,Joey>那没什么大不了的
<7-19,Joey>Thank god. That's no big deal.

200
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,810
<7-20,Ross>很多女人都不会有感觉
<7-20,Ross>Most women don't feel them.

201
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,790
<7-21,Rachel>没有子宫就没有发言权
<7-21,Rachel>No uterus, no opinion.

202
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:24,640
<7-22,Joey>-你买糖果干嘛  -你呼我的时候
<7-22,Joey>- What's with the candy? - When you beeped me,

203
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,490
<7-23,Ross>我正在电影院买零食
<7-23,Ross>I was at the concession stand at the movie theater.

204
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:30,540
<7-24,Rachel>-你自己去看电影吗  -蒙娜
<7-24,Rachel>- You went to the movies by yourself? - Mona!

205
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:34,190
<7-26,Rachel>我得回检查室去
<7-26,Rachel>I gotta go back in there.

206
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:35,520
<7-27,Ross>发生了什么事
<7-27,Ross>Why? What's wrong?

207
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,960
<7-28,Rachel>没事  我只是得回去...
<7-28,Rachel>No, everything's fine. I just gotta go back...

208
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,140
<7-29,Ross>不  告诉我  怎么了
<7-29,Ross>No, really, tell me. What's up?

209
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,650
<7-30,Rachel>我把内裤落在里面了
<7-30,Rachel>Look, I forgot my underwear.

210
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,880
<7-31,Ross>谢谢你送她来医院
<7-31,Ross>Thanks so much for bringing her to the hospital.

211
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,340
<7-32,Joey>别放在心上  没有什么大不了
<7-32,Joey>Don't worry about it. No big deal.

212
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:55,320
<7-33,Ross>但应该由我送她来  我毕竟是孩子他爸
<7-33,Ross>But still, it should have been me. I'm the dad.

213
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,190
<7-34,Dr. Long>如果还有疑问
<7-34,Dr. Long>If you have any questions,

214
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:00,900
<7-34,Dr. Long>-这是假性宫缩的资料  -谢谢
<7-34,Dr. Long>- Here's information on Braxton Hicks. - Thanks.

215
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:04,010
<7-34,Dr. Long>对了  你送她过来是对的
<7-34,Dr. Long>By the way, you did the right thing by bringing her in.

216
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:05,620
<7-34,Dr. Long>你会是个好爸爸
<7-34,Dr. Long>You'll make a wonderful father.

217
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:12,240
<7-35,Joey>我没有这家伙厉害  他买了糖果
<7-35,Joey>Hey, not as good as this guy. He brought Twizzlers.

218
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,790
<8-1,Chandler>一定会有办法
<8-1,Chandler>There has got to be a way.

219
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,950
<8-2,Joey>别紧张  寇克船长
<8-2,Joey>Easy there, Captain Kirk.

221
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:27,230
<8-2,Joey>-你有发夹吗  -有
<8-2,Joey>- Do you have a bobby pin? - Yeah.

222
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:30,850
<8-3,Chandler>不对  我不是九岁的小女孩
<8-3,Chandler>Oh, no, wait. I'm not a 9-year-old girl.

223
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,860
<8-4,Joey>那为什么你投球的时候很像
<8-4,Joey>Then why do you throw like one?

224
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,240
<8-5,Chandler>或许莫妮卡有发夹
<8-5,Chandler>Maybe Monica has a bobby pin.

225
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,340
<8-6,Joey>是啊  "莫妮卡"什么都有
<8-6,Joey>Oh, sure, "Monica."

226
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,760
<8-7,Chandler>你暗恋瑞秋那事怎么样了
<8-7,Chandler>So, how's the hideously inappropriate crush on Rachel coming?

227
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,790
<8-8,Joey>很不错  我该随时做好自杀的准备
<8-8,Joey>Really good. I should be ready to kill myself any day now.

228
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:50,900
<8-8,Joey>你这么快就找到了
<8-8,Joey>Well, you sure found that quick.

229
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,140
<8-8,Joey>我真希望对瑞秋的感觉能淡去
<8-8,Joey>I wish I didn't feel this way about Rachel any more.

230
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:00,350
<8-8,Joey>我希望一切能恢复正常
<8-8,Joey>I wish things could go back to normal.

231
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:02,540
<8-8,Joey>我喜欢跟她一起住
<8-8,Joey>I love living with her,

232
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:05,700
<8-8,Joey>在怀孕期间照顾她感觉也很棒
<8-8,Joey>and helping out with the baby is amazing.

233
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:09,460
<8-8,Joey>但罗斯会觉得自己像个局外人
<8-8,Joey>But now I think Ross feels left out.

234
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,920
<8-8,Joey>我送瑞秋去医院
<8-8,Joey>When I took Rachel to the hospital,

235
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,220
<8-8,Joey>医生还以为我是孩子他爸
<8-8,Joey>the doctor thought I was the father.

236
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:16,870
<8-8,Joey>罗斯的表情很不自然
<8-8,Joey>You should have seen the look on Ross' face.

237
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,400
<8-8,Joey>我不知道自己在干嘛
<8-8,Joey>By the way, I have no idea what I'm doing here.

238
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,540
<8-8,Joey>我只知道锁越捅越紧
<8-8,Joey>For all I know, I'm just locking it more.

239
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,690
<8-8,Joey>你试过用信用卡吗
<8-8,Joey>Did you try opening it with a credit card?

240
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:27,690
<8-9,Chandler>-好点子  -好
<8-9,Chandler>- That's a good idea. - Okay.

241
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,620
<8-11,Chandler>罗斯有点失落是吧
<8-11,Chandler>So Ross is kind of bummed, huh?

242
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,880
<8-12,Joey>-我感觉很过意不去  -那不是你的错
<8-12,Joey>- I feel terrible. - It's not your fault.

243
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,210
<8-13,Chandler>不然你要怎么做  不送她去医院吗
<8-13,Chandler>What are you gonna do, not take her to the hospital?

244
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:38,850
<8-13,Chandler>你没做错事
<8-13,Chandler>You're doing nothing wrong.

245
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,810
<8-13,Chandler>但你不该爱上
<8-13,Chandler>Except for harboring an all consuming love

246
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,800
<8-13,Chandler>怀着他孩子的女人
<8-13,Chandler>for the woman whose carrying his baby.

00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,180
<8-13,Chandler>理查德  如果你在里面
<8-13,Chandler>Richard, if you're in there,

<9-3,Monica>I gotta tell you, yesterday was amazing.

250
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,490
<9-3,Monica>按摩感觉舒服极了
<9-3,Monica>That massage felt so good.

251
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:03,140
<9-4,Phoebe>我懂的
<9-4,Phoebe>No, I got that.

252
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,800
<9-5,Monica>你能每星期帮我按摩一次吗
<9-5,Monica>So, what do you say we make it a weekly appointment?

253
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,910
<9-5,Monica>好吧
<9-5,Monica>Okay.

254
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:13,000
<9-6,Phoebe>但你得知道  我的时薪涨到两百块了
<9-6,Phoebe>You should know though, I've raised my rates to $200 an hour.

255
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:16,280
<9-8,Phoebe>-好吧  -我是说五百块
<9-8,Phoebe>- Okay. - I mean 500.

00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,560
<9-10,Phoebe>-什么  -六百块
<9-10,Phoebe>- What? - 600.

257
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:20,740
<9-11,Monica>怎么回事
<9-11,Monica>What's going on?

258
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:23,820
<9-12,Phoebe>我给你按摩你的时候  你会发出叫床声
<9-12,Phoebe>You make sex noises when you get massaged.

259
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,840
<9-13,Monica>-什么  -我一下子就乱了手脚
<9-13,Monica>- What? - Yeah, and it really freaked me out!

260
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,730
<9-14,Phoebe>之后我想用力弄痛你
<9-14,Phoebe>And after a while I even tried to hurt you

261
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:29,900
<9-14,Phoebe>结果你叫得更大声
<9-14,Phoebe>and it just spurred you on.

262
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:31,980
<9-15,Monica>你疯了吧
<9-15,Monica>What? You're crazy.

263
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,430
<9-15,Monica>我的叫声一点都不淫荡
<9-15,Monica>There's nothing sexual about the noises I make.

264
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:36,810
<9-16,Phoebe>是吗  这样一点都不淫荡吗
<9-16,Phoebe>Really? There's nothing sexual about this?

265
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,850
<9-16,Phoebe>天啊
<9-16,Phoebe>Oh, God!

266
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:44,890
<9-16,Phoebe>你看什么看
<9-16,Phoebe>What are you looking at?

267
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:48,150
<9-16,Phoebe>我是说  嗨
<9-16,Phoebe>I mean, hi.

268
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:51,620
<9-17,Monica>这简直太丢脸了
<9-17,Monica>This is so embarrassing.

269
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,720
<9-17,Monica>我再也不按摩了
<9-17,Monica>Oh, my god. I'm never getting a massage again.

270
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:57,000
<9-18,Phoebe>别让这个问题害你放弃按摩
<9-18,Phoebe>No, you can't let this stop you from getting massages.

271
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,910
<9-18,Phoebe>我有很多客人
<9-18,Phoebe>Look, I have lots of clients

272
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,940
<9-18,Phoebe>也会发出那种叫声
<9-18,Phoebe>that make the same noises as you do.

273
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:03,370
<9-20,Phoebe>-真的吗  -他们不是客人  是床伴
<9-20,Phoebe>- Really? - Well, not clients. Lovers.

274
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,300
<9-20,Phoebe>我们再试一次
<9-20,Phoebe>We'll try it again.

00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,880
<9-20,Phoebe>再来找我  我们想办法解决
<9-20,Phoebe>Come back, and we'll work through it.

00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:11,910
<9-23,Monica>-你确定  -对
<9-23,Monica>- You sure? - Yes.

277
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:17,500
<9-24,Phoebe>-好吧  -太棒了  失陪一下
<9-24,Phoebe>- I guess. - Great! Now, if you'll just excuse me.

278
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,300
<9-24,Phoebe>你刚才听到你中意的声音了吗
<9-24,Phoebe>So did you hear something you liked?

279
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:28,200
<10-1,Rachel>罗斯  你看  我学到了新把戏
<10-1,Rachel>Hey, Ross, check it out! I learned a new trick.

280
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:31,710
<10-2,Ross>我帮你买了午餐
<10-2,Ross>Hey, I brought you some lunch.

281
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:37,540
<10-3,Rachel>你真的太贴心了  美味啊
<10-3,Rachel>Oh, that's so sweet of you. Oh, yum.

282
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:44,740
<10-3,Rachel>-你放了腌黄瓜吗  -对
<10-3,Rachel>- Did you put pickles on this? - Well, yeah.

283
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:47,870
<10-5,Rachel>怎么  瑞秋  怎么了
<10-5,Rachel>What? What? Rach, what?

284
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,810
<10-6,Ross>发生了什么事
<10-6,Ross>What's going on?

285
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:52,000
<10-8,Ross>我帮她带了最爱吃的腌黄瓜金枪鱼三明治
<10-8,Ross>I made her favorite, tuna salad with pickles.

286
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:54,810
<10-9,Joey>腌黄瓜  那会让她恶心
<10-9,Joey>Pickle? Pickle makes her sick.

287
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:57,950
<10-9,Joey>让她吃腌黄瓜就像让我吃沙拉
<10-9,Joey>Giving her pickle is like giving me salad.

288
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:02,500
<10-10,Ross>抱歉  我不知道  你还好吗
<10-10,Ross>I'm sorry Rach, I didn't know. Are you gonna be okay?

289
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,380
<10-11,Rachel>我没事
<10-11,Rachel>Yeah, I'll be fine,

290
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,240
<10-11,Rachel>趁我不在  谁能赶紧把那个三明治
<10-11,Rachel>But could someone please make sure that sandwich is gone

291
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,610
<10-11,Rachel>-给解决掉  -我在吃了
<10-11,Rachel>- when I get out there? - I'm on it!

292
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,740
<10-12,Joey>怎么会这样
<10-12,Joey>I can't believe this.

293
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,880
<10-13,Ross>我不该惹她恶心的
<10-13,Ross>I shouldn't be the one making her throw up.

294
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,120
<10-14,Joey>放轻松  罗斯  谁都可能做出这种事
<10-14,Joey>Relax, Ross. It could happen to anyone.

295
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,420
<10-15,Ross>你就不会  因为你了解她
<10-15,Ross>Yeah, not to you. 'Cause you know this stuff.

296
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,520
<10-15,Ross>我什么都不知道  亏我还是孩子他爸
<10-15,Ross>I don't know any of it and I'm the father.

297
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,420
<10-15,Ross>真希望自己能更多地参与其中
<10-15,Ross>I wish I could be more involved, you know?

298
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:31,810
<10-16,Rachel>谁帮我记下来
<10-16,Rachel>Well, if anyone is keeping score,

299
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,970
<10-16,Rachel>我绝不会再吃金枪鱼了
<10-16,Rachel>I no longer eat tuna.

300
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:39,820
<10-17,Joey>我能跟你们谈一谈吗
<10-17,Joey>Can I talk to you guys for a second?

301
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,370
<10-19,Rachel>-可以啊  -怎么了
<10-19,Rachel>- Yeah. - What's up?

302
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,870
<10-20,Joey>坐吧  我想谈谈我们现在的情况
<10-20,Joey>Sit down. I wanna talk about our situation.

303
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,720
<10-21,Rachel>你要跟我们分手吗
<10-21,Rachel>Are you breaking up with us?

304
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,510
<10-22,Joey>我想说的是...
<10-22,Joey>The thing is...

305
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:59,260
<10-22,Joey>因为我跟瑞秋一起住  我参与了不少事情
<10-22,Joey>...because I live with Rachel, I'm here for a lot of stuff.

306
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:05,290
<10-22,Joey>而罗斯却不断错过  所以
<10-22,Joey>And Ross is missing everything. So...

307
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:07,290
<10-23,Rachel>怎么了
<10-23,Rachel>Yeah?

308
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:11,380
<10-24,Joey>也许你们两个应该住在一起
<10-24,Joey>Maybe you two should live together.

309
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,560
<10-25,Rachel>你要我搬出去吗  你不想让我住在这里了
<10-25,Rachel>Are you asking me to move out? You don't want me here?

310
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:17,910
<10-26,Joey>不是  我喜欢跟你一起住  只不过...
<10-26,Joey>No, I love living with you. It just seems that...

311
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:23,130
<10-26,Joey>要找室友  也最好是孩子他爸
<10-26,Joey>...if you're gonna have a roommate, it may as well be the father.

312
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:26,220
<10-27,Rachel>乔伊  我觉得罗斯不希望
<10-27,Rachel>But, Joey, I don't think Ross wants me to move into his apartment

313
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:28,660
<10-27,Rachel>我搬过去干扰他的生活
<10-27,Rachel>and disrupt his life like that.

314
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:32,780
<10-27,Rachel>或许他希望我搬过去
<10-27,Rachel>Or he does.

315
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:38,110
<10-28,Ross>我很乐意照顾你跟宝宝
<10-28,Ross>I would love to be around for you and the baby.

316
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:42,140
<10-28,Ross>我们可以先试一阵子
<10-28,Ross>We can just try it, like on a temporary basis.

317
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,790
<10-29,Rachel>但咱们有太多过往
<10-29,Rachel>But Ross, it's you and me.

318
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:45,910
<10-30,Ross>对  但我们不会有感情牵扯
<10-30,Ross>Sure, but it wouldn't be anything romantic.

319
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:49,470
<10-30,Ross>我在和蒙娜交往  该死  又把蒙娜忘了
<10-30,Ross>I'm dating Mona. Damn it, Mona!

320
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:53,060
<10-30,Ross>我跟她约好一小时前见面
<10-30,Ross>I was supposed to meet her an hour ago.

321
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,680
<10-30,Ross>我这是怎么了
<10-30,Ross>What is wrong with me?

322
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:59,000
<10-31,Joey>你们意下如何
<10-31,Joey>So, what do you think?

323
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:02,210
<10-32,Rachel>-我不知道  那很疯狂吧  -不
<10-32,Rachel>- I don't know. Is it crazy? - No, no, it's not...

324
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:04,330
<10-33,Ross>乔伊  这是个聪明点子
<10-33,Ross>Joey, this is a smart idea.

325
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,250
<10-34,Joey>我早该想到的
<10-34,Joey>Well, I was due.

326
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:09,970
<10-35,Rachel>就这么办吧  我搬过去
<10-35,Rachel>Okay, let's do it. I'll move in.

327
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:10,960
<10-37,Rachel>-真的吗  -对
<10-37,Rachel>- Really? - Yeah.

328
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,210
<10-38,Ross>瑞秋  那真是太棒了
<10-38,Ross>Rach, that's great. That's great.

329
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,200
<11-1,Chandler>还不赖嘛  我自己就把这玩意卸下来了
<11-1,Chandler>Not too shabby. I got this all off myself...

330
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,310
<11-1,Chandler>用我老婆的工具
<11-1,Chandler>...using my wife's tools.

331
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:39,850
<11-1,Chandler>我的天啊
<11-1,Chandler>Oh, my God.

332
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,580
<11-2,Monica>你是怎么把它打开的
<11-2,Monica>How did you get in there?

333
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:49,680
<11-3,Chandler>你很邋遢
<11-3,Chandler>You're messy.

334
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:53,080
<11-4,Monica>不  你不该看到这个场面的
<11-4,Monica>No! You weren't supposed to see this!

335
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,280
<11-5,Chandler>我娶了弗雷德·山福德[垃圾场主]
<11-5,Chandler>I married Fred Sanford.

336
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:58,230
<11-6,Monica>钱德勒  你不了解
<11-6,Monica>No, Chandler, you don't understand.

337
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:05,160
<11-6,Monica>好吧  现在你知道了
<11-6,Monica>Okay, okay, fine! Now you know, okay?

338
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:10,010
<11-7,Chandler>-我很病态  -不  老婆  你不病态
<11-7,Chandler>- I'm sick. - No, honey, you're not sick.

339
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:12,920
<11-7,Chandler>我爱你不是因为你井井有条
<11-7,Chandler>Look, I don't love you because you're organized.

340
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,120
<11-7,Chandler>不论如何  我都爱你
<11-7,Chandler>I love you in spite of that.

341
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:17,540
<11-7,Chandler>真的吗
<11-7,Chandler>Really?

342
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,830
<11-8,Monica>-你发誓不会告诉任何人  -对
<11-8,Monica>- Promise you won't tell anyone? - Yes.

343
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:24,820
<11-9,Chandler>既然我知道了  那如果我有多余的东西
<11-9,Chandler>And look, now that I know if I got some extra stuff lying around,

344
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:27,110
<11-9,Chandler>可以也放进那个储藏室吗
<11-9,Chandler>can we share the closet?

345
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:31,210
<11-10,Monica>可是...
<11-10,Monica>Well... It's just...

346
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,300
<11-10,Monica>我怕你会把里面弄乱
<11-10,Monica>I'm afraid you might mess it up.

347
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:46,390
<12-2,Joey>瑞秋彻底搬出去了  你还好吧
<12-2,Joey>So Rachel's all moved out? How you taking it?

348
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:51,270
<12-3,Chandler>我本想喝几瓶啤酒  但我把啤酒都丢了
<12-3,Chandler>I wanted to have a few beers, but I got rid of those

349
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:53,530
<12-4,Joey>因为瑞秋受不了那个味道
<12-4,Joey>because Rachel couldn't stand the smell of them.

350
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:57,660
<12-4,Joey>我买了不少加钙的柳橙汁
<12-4,Joey>I have thrown back a lot of orange juice with calcium.

351
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,270
<12-4,Joey>已经过期几星期了
<12-4,Joey>It's a couple weeks past its expiration date,

352
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:03,410
<12-4,Joey>所以会有点酒精的效力
<12-4,Joey>so it's got a bit of a kick.

353
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,110
<12-5,Chandler>你没事吧
<12-5,Chandler>Are you okay?

354
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:11,410
<12-5,Chandler>开什么玩笑  我棒极了
<12-5,Chandler>You kidding me? Yeah, I'm great.

355
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:15,060
<12-6,Joey>我好到不能再好  我很好
<12-6,Joey>I'm better than great. I am good.

356
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,260
<12-6,Joey>现在她搬走了
<12-6,Joey>Now that she's gone,

357
