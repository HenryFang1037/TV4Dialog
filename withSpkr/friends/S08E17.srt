1
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:08,500
<1-1,Rachel>乔伊  你在吗
<1-1,Rachel>Joey? Are you in there?

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,990
<2-2,Monica>-是瑞秋  -乔伊  你得跟她谈一谈
<2-2,Monica>- That's Rachel. - Joey, you have to talk to her.

3
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:13,110
<2-2,Monica>不行  经过那晚的事之后
<2-2,Monica>No. I can't. I can't. Not after the other night.

4
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,170
<2-3,Joey>感觉太奇怪了
<2-3,Joey>It's too weird, okay?

5
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:16,780
<2-3,Joey>别告诉她我在这里
<2-3,Joey>Don't tell her I'm here.

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,190
<2-3,Joey>别吃那个
<2-3,Joey>Don't eat that!

7
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,700
<2-5,Chandler>-瑞秋  -乔伊在吗
<2-5,Chandler>- Hey, Rachel. - Is Joey here?

8
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,420
<2-6,Monica>-我没有看到他  你呢  -没有
<2-6,Monica>- I don't see him. Do you see him? - I don't see him.

9
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:30,440
<2-8,Chandler>或许他在糖碗里  乔伊  没人
<2-8,Chandler>Maybe he's in the sugar bowl. Joey? Nope.

10
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,070
<2-10,Rachel>至少你们能彼此逗乐
<2-10,Rachel>Well, at least you make each other laugh.

11
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,830
<2-11,Monica>-怎么了  -自从他那晚跟我坦白之后
<2-11,Monica>- What's up? - I haven't seen him since that night

12
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:40,750
<2-12,Rachel>我就一直没见过他
<2-12,Rachel>that he told me how he, you know...

13
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:43,260
<2-12,Rachel>我觉得他在躲我
<2-12,Rachel>I don't know, I think he's avoiding me.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,750
<2-12,Rachel>为什么地板上会有百吉饼
<2-12,Rachel>Why is that bagel on the floor?

15
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:50,780
<2-13,Monica>-我们在玩游戏  -钱德勒脱了衣服玩的吗
<2-13,Monica>- We were playing a game.- Was Chandler naked?

16
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,780
<2-14,Rachel>像是套圈圈之类的游戏吗
<2-14,Rachel>Sort of like a ring-toss kind of situation?

17
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:59,720
<2-16,Chandler>-没错  -什么  不是
<2-16,Chandler>- Sure! - What? No! No!

18
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:02,530
<2-17,Rachel>好吧  如果你们看到乔伊
<2-17,Rachel>All right, listen. If you see Joey,

19
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,480
<2-17,Rachel>能不能告诉他...
<2-17,Rachel>will you just tell him that...?

20
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,440
<2-17,Rachel>告诉他我很想他
<2-17,Rachel>Tell him I miss him.

21
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:15,040
<2-18,Monica>好吧  你听到了吗
<2-18,Monica>Okay. Did you hear that?

22
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:17,460
<2-19,Joey>是啊  裸体百吉饼游戏
<2-19,Joey>Yeah. That naked bagel game?

23
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:22,040
<2-19,Joey>我很怀疑  这个洞很小的
<2-19,Joey>Dude, I don't know. That's a pretty small hole.

24
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,830
<2-20,Monica>-你得跟她谈一谈  -我做不到
<2-20,Monica>- Honey, you've gotta talk to her. - I can't.

25
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:29,390
<2-21,Joey>你们不知道真情告白之后
<2-21,Joey>You guys don't know what it's like

26
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:32,270
<2-21,Joey>却被拒绝的感觉有多难受
<2-21,Joey>to put yourself out there like that and just get shot down.

27
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:33,940
<2-21,Joey>我不知道那种感觉
<2-21,Joey>I don't know what that's like?

28
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,820
<2-22,Chandler>我在25岁前一直以为
<2-22,Chandler>Until I was 25, I thought the response

29
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,980
<2-22,Chandler>对"我爱你"的回应是"真糟糕"
<2-22,Chandler>to "I love you" was "Oh, crap."

30
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,370
<2-23,Monica>我没有被拒绝过
<2-23,Monica>No rejection?

31
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,520
<2-23,Monica>我连在减肥营都被拒绝过
<2-23,Monica>I got shot down at fat camp.

32
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:47,860
<2-23,Monica>天啊  饿肚子的孩子可真恶毒
<2-23,Monica>Boy, kids are mean when they're hungry.

33
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,540
<2-24,Joey>我该怎么办
<2-24,Joey>So, what do I do?

34
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:55,590
<2-25,Monica>她是瑞秋  难道你永远都不跟她说话了吗
<2-25,Monica>This Rachel. You're gonna never talk to her again?

35
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:58,970
<2-25,Monica>那很奇怪  也很尴尬  但至少你得试试看
<2-25,Monica>I know it's weird and it's awkward, but you gotta at least try.

36
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,610
<2-26,Joey>好吧
<2-26,Joey>Yeah, okay.

37
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:06,100
<2-26,Joey>我忘了这个曾套在你的...
<2-26,Joey>I almost forgot this was on your...

38
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,760
<2-27,Chandler>我们根本就没玩
<2-27,Chandler>We didn't play it!

50
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,900
<3-1,Phoebe>等你们喝完茶之后
<3-1,Phoebe>Okay, so when you're done with your tea,

51
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,750
<3-1,Phoebe>我可以看茶叶帮你们算命
<3-1,Phoebe>I'll look at the leaves and tell your fortune.

52
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,830
<3-2,Chandler>-你会茶叶算命法吗  -我做过好几年了
<3-2,Chandler>- You didn't know read tea leaves? - I've done it for years.

53
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:58,570
<3-3,Phoebe>我后来放弃是因为我算得太难了
<3-3,Phoebe>I actually stopped because I was so accurate.

54
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:01,630
<3-3,Phoebe>生命最大的乐趣之一
<3-3,Phoebe>And one of the great joys of life...

55
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:05,310
<3-3,Phoebe>就在于其神奇的不可预测性
<3-3,Phoebe>...is its wondrous unpredictability, you know?

56
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,820
<3-3,Phoebe>而且我喝茶会拉肚子
<3-3,Phoebe>And also, tea tends to give me the trots.

57
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,730
<3-4,Monica>-我喝完了  帮我算吧  -好的
<3-4,Monica>- Okay. I'm done. Read mine. - Okay.

58
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:14,600
<3-5,Phoebe>我看到一个梯子
<3-5,Phoebe>I see a ladder.

59
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:20,020
<3-5,Phoebe>代表的要么是升职  要么是暴力性死亡
<3-5,Phoebe>Which can mean either a promotion or a violent death.

60
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,620
<3-6,Monica>我是主厨  不可能再升职了
<3-6,Monica>I'm the head chef. I can't get promoted.

61
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,780
<3-7,Phoebe>下一个是谁
<3-7,Phoebe>Who's next?

62
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:32,920
<3-8,Rachel>-我喝完了  帮我算  -好吧
<3-8,Rachel>- Okay. I'm done. Do mine. - Okay.

63
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,760
<3-9,Phoebe>好吧  我看到一个圈圈
<3-9,Phoebe>Oh! Okay, I see a circle.

64
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:40,620
<3-10,Rachel>那表示你要么怀了孩子
<3-10,Rachel>Which can either mean you're having a baby...

65
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:44,230
<3-11,Phoebe>要么会做出科学发现
<3-11,Phoebe>...or you'll make a scientific discovery!

66
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:47,770
<3-12,Rachel>我确实经常在实验室待着
<3-12,Rachel>Well, I have been spending a lot of time in the lab.

67
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,820
<3-13,Chandler>你的茶叶又预示着什么呢  菲比
<3-13,Chandler>What does yours say, Pheebs?

68
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:52,600
<3-13,Chandler>好吧
<3-13,Chandler>All right.

69
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,190
<3-14,Phoebe>我会认识一个男人  而且很快
<3-14,Phoebe>Oh, I'm gonna meet a guy! And really soon!

70
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,290
<3-14,Phoebe>他会是我的梦中情人
<3-14,Phoebe>He's gonna be the man of my dreams.

71
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:05,630
<3-14,Phoebe>或许不是我昨晚梦到的那个男人
<3-14,Phoebe>Probably not the guy I had a dream about last night.

72
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:12,840
<3-15,Ross>有人看到我的衬衫吗
<3-15,Ross>Has anyone seen my shirt?

73
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,760
<3-15,Ross>是前开式的淡鲑鱼色衬衫
<3-15,Ross>It's a button-down, like a faded salmon color?

74
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,390
<3-16,Monica>你是说那件粉红色衬衫吗
<3-16,Monica>You mean your pink shirt?

75
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,840
<3-17,Ross>淡鲑鱼色
<3-17,Ross>Faded salmon color?

76
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:24,030
<3-18,Monica>不  我没看到你的粉红色衬衫
<3-18,Monica>No, I haven't seen your pink shirt.

77
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:28,590
<3-19,Ross>我一定把它落在蒙娜家了  我就知道
<3-19,Ross>Great. I must have left it at Mona's. I knew it!

78
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:31,010
<3-20,Chandler>你可以到安·泰勒的专卖店再买一件
<3-20,Chandler>I'm sure you can get another one at Ann Taylor's.

79
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:36,390
<3-21,Ross>那是我最爱的衬衫  我超喜欢
<3-21,Ross>That's my favorite shirt. I love that shirt.

80
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:38,710
<3-22,Rachel>那就让蒙娜还给你啊
<3-22,Rachel>Just ask Mona to give it back.

81
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:40,670
<3-22,Rachel>我不知道  或许可以吧
<3-22,Rachel>I don't know. I guess could.

82
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:43,930
<3-23,Ross>只是我们最后闹得不太愉快
<3-23,Ross>It's just we didn't really end things on such good terms.

83
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,220
<3-23,Ross>如果我去她家
<3-23,Ross>And if I went over there,

84
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:48,610
<3-23,Ross>就等于无视她分手时对我提出的唯一要求
<3-23,Ross>I'd be ignoring the one thing she asked me to do when we broke up.

85
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:50,780
<3-23,Ross>她要我去跳楼自杀
<3-23,Ross>Jump up my own ass and die.

86
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,950
<3-24,Phoebe>等一下
<3-24,Phoebe>Oh, wait a second, you guys?

87
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,040
<3-24,Phoebe>这几周以来
<3-24,Phoebe>For the last couple weeks,

88
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,010
<3-24,Phoebe>我走到哪里都会看到那个男人
<3-24,Phoebe>I've been seeing that guy everywhere I go.

89
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,580
<3-24,Phoebe>我们搭同一班公车  去同一家书店
<3-24,Phoebe>We take the same bus, we go to the same bookstore,

90
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:06,400
<3-24,Phoebe>同一家干洗店  或许他就是我的真命天子
<3-24,Phoebe>and the same dry cleaners. Maybe he's the tea guy.

91
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,260
<3-25,Chandler>菲比  你们看到了吗
<3-25,Chandler>Phoebe, did you see that?

92
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:14,320
<3-25,Chandler>他绝对是在打量你  而且他超帅的
<3-25,Chandler>He totally checked you out! And he is so cute!

93
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:21,360
<3-25,Chandler>我的茶叶像是乡巴佬  那是什么意思
<3-25,Chandler>Mine is a picture of the Village People. What does that mean?

94
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,780
<3-25,Chandler>菲比喝茶会拉肚子
<3-25,Chandler>Tea gives Phoebe the trots!

95
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:05,260
<4-1,Rachel>我以为乔伊跟我待在一起就不会尴尬了
<4-1,Rachel>I thought Joey and I would be okay once we hung out,

96
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:08,040
<4-1,Rachel>但现在我们都不知道该怎么相处
<4-1,Rachel>but it's like we don't even know how to be with each other any more.

97
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,370
<4-2,Chandler>虽说你们现在很难相处  但情况会改善的
<4-2,Chandler>I konw, it's tough now, but things will get better.

98
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,060
<4-3,Rachel>你怎么知道
<4-3,Rachel>How do you know that?

99
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,610
<4-3,Rachel>如果情况不断恶化...
<4-3,Rachel>What if it gets worse and worse and worse,

100
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:17,480
<4-3,Rachel>我们都无法共处一室了该怎么办呢
<4-3,Rachel>to the point where we can't be in the same room with each other?

101
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,370
<4-4,Chandler>我不善于给人提建议
<4-4,Chandler>I'm not great at the advice.

102
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:23,410
<4-4,Chandler>我能讽刺你一番吗
<4-4,Chandler>Can I interest you in a sarcastic comment?

103
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:26,780
<4-4,Chandler>要奶酪吗
<4-4,Chandler>Some cheese?

104
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:33,010
<4-5,Monica>老公  为什么布鲁斯·史普林斯汀的CD
<4-5,Monica>Honey, why is the Bruce Springsteen CD

105
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:35,030
<4-5,Monica>会放在凯特·史帝文斯的盒子里
<4-5,Monica>in the Cat Stevens case?

106
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:36,960
<4-6,Chandler>如果我找不到正确的盒子
<4-6,Chandler>Let's just say if I can't find the right CD case,

107
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,790
<4-6,Chandler>我就会随手拿个盒子来装
<4-6,Chandler>I just put it in the nearest one.

108
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,500
<4-7,Monica>那凯特·史帝文斯的CD在哪里
<4-7,Monica>Okay. Where is the Cat Stevens CD?

109
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,010
<4-8,Chandler>在詹姆士·泰勒的盒子里
<4-8,Chandler>In the James Taylor case.

110
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:45,890
<4-9,Monica>-那张CD在哪里  -我帮你节省些时间吧
<4-9,Monica>- Where is James Taylor CD? - Honey, I'll save you some time.

111
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,480
<4-10,Chandler>那200张CD没有一张是放在正确盒子里的
<4-10,Chandler>Two hundred CDs, not one of them in the right case.

112
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:54,520
<4-11,Monica>好吧  不需要慌张  大家深呼吸
<4-11,Monica>Okay. No need to panic. Deep breaths, everyone.

113
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,280
<4-11,Monica>我们只需要花些时间
<4-11,Monica>Okay, we're just gonna have to spend some time

114
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,960
<4-11,Monica>把CD放在正确的盒子里
<4-11,Monica>and put the CDs in the right cases.

115
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,170
<4-12,Chandler>如果要整理的话  那就应该按某种顺序排好
<4-12,Chandler>If we do that, we should come up with some kind of order.

116
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,570
<4-12,Chandler>按字母顺序或音乐风格
<4-12,Chandler>You know, alphabetically or by genre?

117
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:06,100
<4-13,Monica>我不知道  这件事我们得好好商量
<4-13,Monica>I don't know. We have to talk this through.

118
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:09,210
<4-14,Rachel>天啊  你们有什么毛病啊
<4-14,Rachel>Oh, my God, you guys have such problems!

119
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:11,220
<4-14,Rachel>我真为你们感到难过
<4-14,Rachel>I feel so terrible for you!

120
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:15,370
<4-14,Rachel>好吧  对不起
<4-14,Rachel>All right. Okay, I'm sorry.

121
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:17,120
<4-15,Monica>你和乔伊两个人满脑子
<4-15,Monica>Look, you and Joey, you're both focusing

122
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,840
<4-15,Monica>都是这件烦人的事
<4-15,Monica>on this uncomfortable thing.

123
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,060
<4-15,Monica>你们需要改变一下话题
<4-15,Monica>What you need to do is to change the subject.

124
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,830
<4-15,Monica>下次见面  跟他谈谈别的事情
<4-15,Monica>Next time you see him try to get him talking about something else.

125
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:25,310
<4-16,Rachel>对  那挺有道理的
<4-16,Rachel>Yeah, that makes sense.

126

131
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:40,360
<4-20,Chandler>我得拿钱去换

<4-22,Rachel>我真的不知道该给你什么建议  瑞秋
<4-22,Rachel>I really don't know what to tell you, Rach, I really don't.

133
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:56,590
<4-23,Monica>或许乔伊可以帮你解决工作上的这个大问题
<4-23,Monica>Maybe Joey could help you out with your big work problem.

<4-36,Joey>-他要买你的宝宝  -你能相信吗
<4-36,Joey>- He wants to buy your baby? - Can you believe that?

154
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:12,280
<4-39,Rachel>-那太疯狂了  -我就是那么跟他说的
<4-39,Rachel>- That's crazy. - That's what I told him!

<4-41,Rachel>我们在圣诞派对上碰了面...
<4-41,Rachel>And then when we were at the Christmas party...

00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,340
<4-41,Rachel>他喝醉了  跟我说
<4-41,Rachel>...he got drunk and said to me,

<4-41,Rachel>"瑞秋  我要买下你的宝宝"
<4-41,Rachel>"Rachel, I want to buy your baby."

<4-42,Joey>Man!

161
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,160
<4-42,Joey>你说问题出在老板跟宝宝身上的时候...
<4-42,Joey>When you said it was a problem about your boss and the baby...

162
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,120
<4-42,Joey>我以为你是指产假的问题
<4-42,Joey>...I figured it was about maternity leave.

163
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,470
<4-42,Joey>对啊
<4-42,Joey>Yeah.

164
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,790
<4-43,Rachel>对  那样子问题就简单多了
<4-43,Rachel>Yeah, that would have been a much simpler problem.

244
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:55,600
<10-13,Rachel>才不会显得尴尬

245
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:57,730
<10-14,Joey>你想不出来别的借口吗

309
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,560
<14-3,Rachel>并不是购买这个宝宝
<14-3,Rachel>should not be construed as a down payment

310
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,790
<14-3,Rachel>或其他宝宝的订金
<14-3,Rachel>on this or any other child that I may bear.
