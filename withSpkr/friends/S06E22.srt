<1-28,Ross>真好笑  但你们也笑太久了吧
<1-28,Ross>That's funny. But maybe it's time to move on.

29
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,530
<1-28,Ross>也是时候适可而止啦
<1-28,Ross>You know, let it go. Stop it!

30
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,620
<1-28,Ross>况且瑞秋在和伊丽莎白的爸爸交往
<1-28,Ross>Besides, Rachel's going out with Elizabeth's father...

31
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:29,740
<1-28,Ross>而他比她大多了
<1-28,Ross>...so he's much older than she is.

32
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:34,230
<1-28,Ross>看来不只是我对"化石"有兴趣
<1-28,Ross>Looks like l'm not the only one interested in fossils.

33
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,640
<1-29,Rachel>罗斯  这只会提醒我们  你爱化石
<1-29,Rachel>Ross, all that does is remind us that you're interested in fossils.

34
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:42,640
<1-29,Rachel>好吧
<1-29,Rachel>Okay, okay.

35
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,840
<1-30,Ross>瑞秋想和他甜言蜜语  可得用吼的
<1-30,Ross>Rachel's gonna need to yell sweet nothings in his ear.

<1-32,Ross>-罗斯  -拜托  这句很好笑啊
<1-32,Ross>- Ross? - Come on! you guys! That's funny. Y'know?

37
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,420
<1-32,Ross>因为他得戴助听器  因为...
<1-32,Ross>Because he's gonna... He's got, like, a hearing aid.

38
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:01,130
<1-32,Ross>因为他很老
<1-32,Ross>Because he's all old.

39
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,600
<1-32,Ross>失陪一下
<1-32,Ross>One second.

40
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:13,100
<1-33,Paul>听着  罗斯
<1-33,Paul>Okay, look, Ross.

41
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,950
<1-33,Paul>因为丽莎很喜欢你
<1-33,Paul>Just so you know, since Lizzie likes you so much...

42
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:19,520
<1-33,Paul>我决定接受你们交往的事
<1-33,Paul>...l've accepted the fact that you're dating her.

43
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,720
<1-34,Ross>真的  太好了
<1-34,Ross>Really? OK. That's great.

44
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,740
<1-35,Paul>是啊  但后来我又反悔了
<1-35,Paul>Yeah, but then l changed my mind.

45
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:25,960
<1-35,Paul>我这人就这么阴晴不定
<1-35,Paul>l'm funny like that.

46
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,230
<1-35,Paul>我已经告诉她了  现在我告诉你
<1-35,Paul>So l told Lizzie, now l'm telling you.

47
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,860
<1-35,Paul>我不希望你再和我女儿见面
<1-35,Paul>l don't want you seeing my daughter anymore.

48
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,360
<1-36,Ross>好  我知道你很不高兴
<1-36,Ross>Alright. Look, l realize it upsets you.

49
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,300
<1-37,Paul>没错
<1-37,Paul>Yes, it does.

50
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:40,930
<1-38,Ross>但伊丽莎白和我都是成年人
<1-38,Ross>But Elizabeth and l are both adults...

51
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:44,980
<1-38,Ross>所以你也拿我们没办法
<1-38,Ross>...so l don't think there's anything you can do about it.

52
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,250
<1-39,Paul>我会告诉学校你们在交往
<1-39,Paul>l'll call the university and tell them about your relationship

53
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,050
<1-39,Paul>让你被开除
<1-39,Paul>and have you fired.

54

<2-2,Joey>之前被挂在墙上时  感觉好棒
<2-2,Joey>It was so cool when l was up there before.

69
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:41,720
<2-2,Joey>我经常和吉姆·贝路西说笑
<2-2,Joey>Me and Jim Belushi would just be cracking up about something.

70
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:46,400
<2-2,Joey>我被《我们的岁月》开除后  照片被拿下来
<2-2,Joey>l get fired off Days of Our Lives and he takes me down.

00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:59,680
<2-3,Phoebe>麦特·劳尔旁边
<2-3,Phoebe>...they could put you by Matt Lauer.

75
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,320
<2-3,Phoebe>你看他在对我微笑
<2-3,Phoebe>Look at him just smiling at me.

99
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:25,800
<3-13,The Museum Official>红毯可以铺在这边
<3-13,The Museum Official>You could put the aisle over here

100
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,840
<3-13,The Museum Official>然后在这边证婚
<3-13,The Museum Official>and have the wedding ceremony over here.

101
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:30,010
<3-14,Rachel>原来这里可以结婚

<3-15,Monica>这里当礼堂的确很美
<3-15,Monica>This would be a beautiful place to get married.

103
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:34,390
<3-15,Monica>但我不会把红毯铺在那边
<3-15,Monica>But l wouldn't put the aisle there.

104
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,310
<3-15,Monica>更不会在那边证婚
<3-15,Monica>And l would never have the ceremony there.

105
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,610
<3-15,Monica>应该在这个漂亮的拱门下证婚
<3-15,Monica>You'd have the ceremony under a beautiful arch.

106
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,710

<3-17,Rachel>-经常举办婚礼吗  -是的  我们很受欢迎
<3-17,Rachel>- Do you do a lot of weddings? - Yes, we're popular.

110
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,720
<3-18,The Museum Official>预约已经排到两年后了  抱歉
<3-18,The Museum Official>There's a two- year waiting list. Sorry.

111
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,220
<3-19,Rachel>莫妮卡  你也应该去预约
<3-19,Rachel>Monica, you should put your name down for this place.

112
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:55,160
<3-20,Monica>什么  你疯了吗
<3-20,Monica>What? Are you crazy?

113
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:58,300
<3-20,Monica>我又不结婚  我甚至还没订婚
<3-20,Monica>l'm not getting married. l'm not even engaged.

114
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,100
<3-18,The Museum Official>但反正要等两年
<3-18,The Museum Official>But there's a two- year wait.

115
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,870
<3-21,Phoebe>要是你两年后订了婚了呢
<3-21,Phoebe>What if you get engaged in two years?

116
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,500
<3-21,Phoebe>还得再等两年呢
<3-21,Phoebe>Then you've got to wait another two years for this place?

117
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,270
<3-21,Phoebe>那就四年了  钱德勒才不会等那么久
<3-21,Phoebe>That's four years. Chandler's not gonna wait that long.

118
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:09,450
<3-21,Phoebe>他会去找别人
<3-21,Phoebe>He's gonna find somebody else.

119
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,050
<3-21,Phoebe>某个有预约的人
<3-21,Phoebe>Someone who did put their name on the list.

120
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,450
<3-22,Rachel>先预约又不会有什么损失
<3-22,Rachel>lt can't hurt to put your name down.

121
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:19,350
<3-22,Rachel>要是两年后没订婚  就放弃不用嘛
<3-22,Rachel>lf, in two years, you're not engaged, you just don't use it.

122
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:22,420
<3-23,Monica>先预约的确不会有什么损失
<3-23,Monica>l guess there is no harm in putting my name down.

123
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,190
<3-24,Rachel>我也要预约
<3-24,Rachel>l'm gonna do it too.

<3-25,Phoebe>Me too!

125
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,640
<3-26,Rachel>真的吗  你要嫁给谁
<3-26,Rachel>Really? Who would you marry?

126
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,930
<3-27,Phoebe>我不知道  我现在还没有对象
<3-27,Phoebe>I don’t know, I don’t have anyone right now. Y’know?

127
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:31,190
<3-28,Rachel>菲比
<3-28,Rachel>Oh, Pheebs.
