1
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,060
<1-1,Ross>还记得我以前养过猴子吗
<1-1,Ross>Remember when l had a monkey?

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,750
<1-3,Ross>我当时脑子在抽什么风啊
<1-3,Ross>Yeah, what..what was l thinking?

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,380
<1-4,Joey>为什么才给20%的小费啊
<1-4,Joey>Hey, so, what's with the 20 percent tip?

4
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,230
<1-4,Joey>我做错什么了吗
<1-4,Joey>Did l do something wrong?

5
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,190
<1-5,Chandler>给你20%很大方了
<1-5,Chandler>20 percent is a pretty generous tip, Joe.

6
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:23,690
<1-6,Joey>你知道多少更大方吗  50%
<1-6,Joey>You know what's more generous than that? 50 percent!

7
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,410
<1-6,Joey>你知道怎样更大方吗
<1-6,Joey>You know what's even more generous than that?

8
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:28,190
<1-7,Chandler>我知道你想说什么了
<1-7,Chandler>l see where you're going.

9
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,120
<1-8,Ross>干嘛突然这么贪钱啊  乔伊
<1-8,Ross>What's up with the greed, Joe?

10
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,370
<1-9,Joey>好吧  对不起  只是...
<1-9,Joey>All right, l'm sorry, you guys. But just...

11
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,630
<1-9,Joey>我得照新的大头照
<1-9,Joey>l have to get new headshots made,

12
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:37,400
<1-9,Joey>但是价格都好贵
<1-9,Joey>and they're really expensive, you know.

13
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,290
<1-9,Joey>我挑了三张
<1-9,Joey>l'm down to, like, three.

14
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,140
<1-9,Joey>其实只剩两张了
<1-9,Joey>Actually, two, because one of them...

15
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:45,280
<1-10,Ross>有一张的牙齿  被我涂黑了  我真白痴啊
<1-10,Ross>l kind of blackened some teeth. Why'd l do that?

16
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,530
<1-10,Ross>没其他方法赚外快了吗
<1-10,Ross>lsn't there something you can do to earn a little extra money?

17
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,490
<1-10,Ross>例如说  在这里多轮一班
<1-10,Ross>I mean, can't you pick up, I don't know, an extra shift here?

18
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,170
<1-11,Phoebe>或是我以前当过乞丐
<1-11,Phoebe>Or, you know, l used to beg for money.

19
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,880
<1-11,Phoebe>当然  如果你能这样
<1-11,Phoebe>Of course it helps if you've got, you know,

20
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,720
<1-11,Phoebe>那就更是手到钱来啦
<1-11,Phoebe>a little of this going on.

21
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,970
<1-11,Phoebe>我现在还会
<1-11,Phoebe>Wow! l still have it.

22
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,620
<1-12,Ross>等等  你今天不是有试镜吗
<1-12,Ross>Wait, wait. Don't you have an audition today?

23
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:09,450
<1-12,Ross>-也许你会入选啊  -真幽默
<1-12,Ross>- Maybe you'll get that job. - Oh, hahaha.

24
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,490
<1-12,Ross>等等
<1-12,Ross>Oh, wait a minute.

25
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:15,630
<1-13,Joey>我以前常参加医学实验
<1-13,Joey>l used to get medical experiments done on me all the time.

26
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:18,960
<1-14,Chandler>难怪变成这样
<1-14,Chandler>Ah, finally, an explanation.

27
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:22,840
<1-15,Joey>不是  我以前常靠这个赚钱  记得吗
<1-15,Joey>No, l used to get paid for all kinds of medical stuff, remember?

28
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:24,440
<1-15,Joey>我想想
<1-15,Joey>Let's see.... well,

29
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,190
<1-15,Joey>我不想再捐精了
<1-15,Joey>l don't want to donate sperm again.

30
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:29,570
<1-15,Joey>这种事我只喜欢在家做
<1-15,Joey>l really prefer doing that at the home office, you know.

31
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,430
<1-15,Joey>也许医院会要我的血或口水什么
<1-15,Joey>Maybe they want some of my blood or spit or something, huh?

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,320
<1-16,Gunther>-乔伊  -怎样
<1-16,Gunther>- Joey? - Yeah.

33
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,520
<1-18,Gunther>我是怎么说工作时跟朋友聊天的
<1-18,Gunther>What did l tell you about talking to your friends while working?

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,200
<1-19,Joey>放胆聊
<1-19,Joey>Do it?

35
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:44,450
<1-20,Gunther>那个人等咖啡等了十分钟
<1-20,Gunther>That guy's been waiting for his coffee for 10 minutes.

36
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:46,770
<1-20,Gunther>投诉你三次了
<1-20,Gunther>He's complained about you three times.

37
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,320
<1-21,Joey>我讲到哪里
<1-21,Joey>Now, where was l?

49
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,560
<2-3,Ross>你们干嘛去了
<2-3,Ross>Hey, what have you guys been up to?

50
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,990
<2-4,Phoebe>我们今天去学防身术
<2-4,Phoebe>We went to a self-defense class today.

51
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,200
<2-6,Rachel>对  踢了一早上的胯下
<2-6,Rachel>Yeah. Kicking a guy in the crotch all morning

52
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,740
<2-7,Joey>什么鸟气都没了
<2-7,Joey>really takes it out of you.

53
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:43,110
<2-7,Joey>你们开心  人家就...
<2-7,Joey>Takes it out of you.

54
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,830
<2-8,Phoebe>-现在我们谁都能修理  -没错
<2-8,Phoebe>- Now we can kick anybody's ass. - Yes.

55
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,600
<2-10,Ross>才一堂课  不可能
<2-10,Ross>After one class? l don't think so.

56
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,080
<2-11,Rachel>干嘛  你想看我自卫吗
<2-11,Rachel>What? You want to see me self-defend myself?

57
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,340
<2-11,Rachel>去那边假装你是性侵者
<2-11,Rachel>Go over there and pretend you're a sexual predator.

58
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:56,700
<2-11,Rachel>有种就去啊
<2-11,Rachel>Go on, l dare you!

59
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:02,130
<2-12,Ross>你当然可以抵挡已知的攻击
<2-12,Ross>Of course you can defend yourself from an attack you know is coming.

60
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:03,850
<2-12,Ross>但那样还不够
<2-12,Ross>That's not enough.

61
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:07,600
<2-12,Ross>听着  我学了很久的控手道
<2-12,Ross>Look, l studied karate for a long time.

62
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,020
<2-12,Ross>有个概念你们一定要了解
<2-12,Ross>And there's a concept you should really be familiar with.

63
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:16,390
<2-12,Ross>日文叫做"漫臾"
<2-12,Ross>lt's what the Japanese call unagi.

64
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:20,280
<2-13,Rachel>那不是一种寿司吗
<2-13,Rachel>lsn't that a kind of sushi?

65
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,180
<2-14,Ross>-那是一种概念  -是寿司没错
<2-14,Ross>- No, it's a concept. - Yeah, it is. It is.

66
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,040
<2-15,Phoebe>就是鳗鱼嘛
<2-15,Phoebe>lt's freshwater eel.

67
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:27,570
<2-16,Ross>或许是同一个字...
<2-16,Ross>Maybe it means that too.

68
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:30,230
<2-17,Rachel>我现在好想吃鲑鱼手握寿司啊
<2-17,Rachel>l would kill for a salmon-skin roll right now.

69
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,440
<2-18,Ross>好  被攻击活该  我不在乎
<2-18,Ross>You know, fine, get attacked. l don't even care.

70
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:37,030
<2-19,Phoebe>罗斯  对不起
<2-19,Phoebe>Come on, Ross, we're sorry.

71
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,890
<2-19,Phoebe>快告诉我们是什么意思
<2-19,Phoebe>Please tell us what it is.

72
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:46,990
<2-20,Ross>漫臾是一种全知的境界
<2-20,Ross>Unagi is a state of total awareness, okay?

73
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:49,420
<2-20,Ross>只有达到真正的漫臾
<2-20,Ross>Only by achieving true unagi...

74
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:53,140
<2-20,Ross>才能应付任何可能的危险
<2-20,Ross>...can you be prepared for any danger that may befall you.

75
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:57,740
<2-21,Phoebe>你是说有人要偷你的竹席
<2-21,Phoebe>You mean in case someone's trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat...

76
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,440
<2-21,Phoebe>或鱼壶的时候吗
<2-21,Phoebe>...or your kettle of fish?

77
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:05,190
<2-21,Phoebe>我的重点是
<2-21,Phoebe>All I am saying it's one thing

78
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:08,050
<2-22,Ross>应付已知要来临的攻击是一回事
<2-22,Ross>being prepared for an attack against, like each other.

79
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:10,220
<2-22,Ross>应付突如其来的袭击又是另一回事
<2-22,Ross>Whole other story being prepared for an attack.

80
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:12,660
<2-22,Ross>比如说...  意外
<2-22,Ross>l don't know -- surprise!

81
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,470
<2-23,Ross>好吧  这次你们料到了
<2-23,Ross>All right you knew that was coming...

82
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:26,010
<2-23,Ross>但不表示你们有漫臾
<2-23,Ross>...but that doesn't mean you have unagi.

83
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,950
<2-24,Rachel>你知道吗   如果现在订位
<2-24,Rachel>Oh, you know what? lf we made reservations,

84
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:33,210
<2-24,Rachel>半小时后就能吃到鳗鱼
<2-24,Rachel>we could have unagi in a half-hour.

85
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,680
<2-26,Chandler>-莫妮卡在吗  -不在
<2-26,Chandler>- ls Monica here? - No.

86
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,030
<2-28,Ross>帮个忙
<2-28,Ross>Okay, look, l need your help.

87
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,360
<2-29,Chandler>我不知道该送什么情人节礼物
<2-29,Chandler>l don't know what to get for Valentine's Day.

88
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,470
<2-30,Rachel>情人节已经过两星期了
<2-30,Rachel>Well, valentine's Day was two weeks ago,

89
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:47,100
<2-30,Rachel>所以我肯定不会送她日历
<2-30,Rachel>so l wouldn't get her a calendar.

90
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,980
<2-31,Chandler>她情人节那天要上班
<2-31,Chandler>She was working on Valentine's Day.

91
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,640
<2-31,Chandler>所以我们改到今晚过
<2-31,Chandler>so we're celebrating it tonight.

92
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:55,990
<2-32,Joey>你们何不订一个浪漫的双人SPA
<2-32,Joey>Why don't you book a day for both of you at those romantic spas?

93
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:58,390
<2-33,Phoebe>乔伊  这个主意很棒
<2-33,Phoebe>Joey, that's actually a good idea.

94
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:01,450
<2-34,Joey>当然  要穿胯下开洞的内裤哦
<2-34,Joey>And, of course, crotchless panties.

95
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:07,110
<2-35,Chandler>虽然对她的男友来说很有吸引力嘛...
<2-35,Chandler>Well, as appealing as that sounds to her boyfriend...

96
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,930
<2-35,Chandler>也许对她的哥哥也是
<2-35,Chandler>...and her brother....

97
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,530
<2-35,Chandler>但不行  我们说好今年要自己做礼物
<2-35,Chandler>I can't do that. We promised to make each other gifts this year.

98
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:17,310
<2-36,Rachel>-我喜欢  -真好
<2-36,Rachel>- Oh, l love that. - You guys!

99
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:19,260
<2-37,Phoebe>你不会做开洞的内裤吗
<2-37,Phoebe>You can't make crotchless panties?

100
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:22,980
<2-38,Joey>只需拿一把剪刀  然后剪...
<2-38,Joey>You take, you take a pair of scissors and you just cut…

101
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,160
<2-39,Rachel>够了  够了
<2-39,Rachel>Okay, okay, okay.

102
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:27,740
<2-39,Rachel>做礼物  听起来好好玩
<2-39,Rachel>So making things sounds so much fun.

103
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:30,840
<2-40,Chandler>我也这么认为  直到我的眼睛糊到纸黏土
<2-40,Chandler>l thought so too, until l papier-mached one of my eyes shut.

104
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,190

00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:45,750
<2-46,Chandler>你们有没有做什么  能让我用的东西
<2-46,Chandler>Have you guys made anything? Maybe l can take credit for?
