<1-15,Chandler>如果你想借钱  有点不是时候
<1-15,Chandler>Listen, if you want to borrow money, its kind of a bad time.

22
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:04,580
<1-16,Ross>我现在不是以你朋友的身分跟你说话...
<1-16,Ross>Now what I'm going to say to you, I'm not saying as your friend.

23
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:07,470
<1-16,Ross>我要以莫妮卡大哥的身份跟你谈
<1-16,Ross>I'm saying as it as Monica's older brother.

24
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:08,600
<1-17,Chandler>但你还是我朋友吧
<1-17,Chandler>But you're still my friend?

00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,460
<1-18,Ross>接下来的几分钟不是
<1-18,Ross>Not for the next few minutes.

28
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,010
<1-21,Chandler>我还可以叫你罗斯吗
<1-21,Chandler>Do I still call you Ross?

<1-22,Ross>我真的替你们俩高兴
<1-22,Ross>and I couldn't be more thrilled for both of you.

31
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:30,950
<1-22,Ross>但身为她的大哥  我得告诉你一件事
<1-22,Ross>But as Monica's older brother, I have to tell you this:

32
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:35,870
<1-22,Ross>如果你敢伤害我妹妹...
<1-22,Ross>If you ever hurt my little sister...

33
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:42,060
<1-22,Ross>如果你敢让她不快乐...
<1-22,Ross>if you ever cause her any unappiness of any kind,

34
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,330
<1-22,Ross>天涯海角我都会找到你...
<1-22,Ross>...I will hunt you down...

35
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,360
<1-22,Ross>然后痛扁你一顿
<1-22,Ross>...and kick your ass.

36
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,350
<1-23,Chandler>怎么了  我是认真的

40
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:08,150
<1-24,Ross>别客气
<1-24,Ross>No problem.

41
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,290
<1-25,Chandler>我们又是朋友了

00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:03,240
<2-2,Monica>可能会出差错的事情
<2-2,Monica>that are most likely to go wrong at the wedding.

58
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,530
<2-2,Monica>给自己打个预防针
<2-2,Monica>So that way I can be prepared.

246
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,350
<9-10,Ross>钱德勒在哪里
<9-10,Ross>Where's Chandler?

247
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:37,580
<9-11,Joey>他大概在瑞秋的房间里
<9-11,Joey>I think he's in Rachel's room. See ya.

248
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,920
<9-12,Ross>钱德勒
<9-12,Ross>Chandler?

249
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,350
<9-12,Ross>钱德勒
<9-12,Ross>Chandler?

250
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:06,260
<10-3,Ross>莫妮卡在吗
<10-3,Ross>Is Monica here?

251
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,480
<10-4,Rachel>她在熨婚纱  怎么了
<10-4,Rachel>She's steaming her dress. Why? What's up?

252
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,770
<10-5,Ross>-我觉得钱德勒走了  -什么
<10-5,Ross>- I think Chandler's gone. - What?

253
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:16,860
<10-7,Ross>-他留下了这个  -告诉莫妮卡我很抱歉
<10-7,Ross>- He left that. - "Tell Monica I'm sorry."

254
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,100
<10-7,Ross>我的天啊
<10-7,Ross>Oh, my God.

255
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,130
<10-8,Rachel>怎么了
<10-8,Rachel>What's up?

256
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,590
<10-8,Rachel>"告诉莫妮卡我很抱歉"
<10-8,Rachel>"Tell Monica I'm sorry."

257
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,300
<10-9,Phoebe>你自己告诉她去
<10-9,Phoebe>Tell her yourself.

258
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:39,060
<11-1,Phoebe>我的天啊  钱德勒走了
<11-1,Phoebe>Oh, my God. Chandler just left, though?

259
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,760
<11-2,Rachel>或许事情不是我们想的那样  或许他是说
<11-2,Rachel>Maybe it's not what we think. Maybe it's:

260
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,650
<11-2,Rachel>"告诉莫妮卡我很抱歉  我把牛奶都喝光了"
<11-2,Rachel>"Tell Monica I'm sorry I drank the last of the milk."

261
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:48,730
<11-3,Phoebe>或许他写这张字条是想告诉她
<11-3,Phoebe>Or maybe he was writing to tell her

262
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:51,160
<11-3,Phoebe>他改了名字
<11-3,Phoebe>that he's changed his name:

263
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,660
<11-3,Phoebe>"告诉莫妮卡我叫抱歉"
<11-3,Phoebe>"Tell Monica I'm Sorry."

264
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:59,030
<11-4,Ross>这表示他临阵脱逃了
<11-4,Ross>I think it means he freaked out and left!

265
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:01,470
<11-5,Phoebe>别那么消极
<11-5,Phoebe>Don't be so negative!

266
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:04,570
<11-5,Phoebe>天啊  有没有可能"抱歉"
<11-5,Phoebe>Good God, isn't it possible that "Sorry"

267
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,840
<11-5,Phoebe>现在就坐在里面
<11-5,Phoebe>is sitting in there right now?

<11-6,Rachel>菲比  我想罗斯说得对  我们该怎么办
<11-6,Rachel>Phoebe, I think Ross is right. What are we gonna do?

269
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:16,940
<11-7,Ross>我得去找他  把他带回来
<11-7,Ross>I'm gonna have to go find him and bring him back.

270
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:20,380
<11-7,Ross>你们别让莫妮卡发现这件事  好吗
<11-7,Ross>You make sure Monica does not find out, okay?

271
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:23,490
<11-9,Phoebe>如果你没办法找到他  把他带回来...
<11-9,Phoebe>But if you don't find him and bring him back...

272
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:26,920
<11-9,Phoebe>天涯海角我都会找到你  然后痛扁你一顿
<11-9,Phoebe>...I am gonna hunt you down and kick your ass!

273
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:38,130
<12-1,Richard>乔伊  你能跟我对一下台词吗
<12-1,Richard>Joey? Can you go through these lines with me?

<12-7,Richard>I don't want to.

281
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:07,960
<12-7,Richard>我得看到你的脸  才能根据你的反应表演
<12-7,Richard>I need to see your face so I can play off your reaction.

341
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:50,160
<15-8,Rachel>但等她换上婚纱  而他又没有出现
<15-8,Rachel>But she'll be in the gown and then he won't show up...

342
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,260

<15-11,Phoebe>振作一点  别让她看到你这个样子
<15-11,Phoebe>You got to pull yourself together. Monica can't see you like this.

347
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,500
<15-11,Phoebe>她会发现不对劲的

00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,550
<15-17,Rachel>没问题
<15-17,Rachel>Sure.

358
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:39,440
<15-18,Phoebe>你需要牙线吗
<15-18,Phoebe>Do you need some floss?

359
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:43,450
<15-19,Rachel>我无法想像如果他不出现
<15-19,Rachel>I just can't imagine what is gonna happen

360
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,180
<15-19,Rachel>会发生什么事
<15-19,Rachel>if Chandler doesn't show up.

361
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,790
<15-20,Phoebe>这里有一大堆卫生纸
<15-20,Phoebe>Here's a whole bunch.

362
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,480
<15-21,Rachel>她会在礼堂等他...
<15-21,Rachel>She'll be at the wedding waiting for him

363
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:53,170
<15-21,Rachel>大家会低声说"那个可怜的姑娘"
<15-21,Rachel>and people will be whispering, "Oh, that poor girl."

364
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:56,730
<15-21,Rachel>然后她得回来这里独自一个人生活
<15-21,Rachel>Then she'll have to come back here and live alone.

365
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:58,810
<15-23,Rachel>-我的天啊  -怎么了
<15-23,Rachel>- Oh, my God. - What?

366
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:02,040
<15-24,Phoebe>垃圾桶有一根验孕棒
<15-24,Phoebe>There was a pregnancy test in the garbage.

367
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,850
<15-24,Phoebe>是阳性反应
<15-24,Phoebe>And it's positive.

368
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:07,280
<15-24,Phoebe>莫妮卡怀孕了
<15-24,Phoebe>Monica's pregnant.

369
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,630
<15-24,Phoebe>我猜她不会寂寞了
<15-24,Phoebe>So I guess she won't be totally alone.
