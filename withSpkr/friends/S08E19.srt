<1-4,Rachel>填《肥皂剧文摘》的字谜游戏
<1-4,Rachel>doing the Soap Opera Digest crossword puzzle...

3
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:11,310

8
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,070
<1-7,Joey>没错  宝贝

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:26,880
<1-8,Monica>纵三知道我结婚了

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,320
<1-8,Monica>纵三在做什么
<1-8,Monica>What's three down doing?

11
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:31,960
<1-9,Rachel>他们有通知你上了杂志吗
<1-9,Rachel>So do they call to tell you your name's gonna be in this?

12
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,530
<1-10,Joey>没有  他们杂志很喜欢我
<1-10,Joey>No. They really like me over there.

13
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:36,360
<1-10,Joey>想找我做人物专访  我拒绝了
<1-10,Joey>They wanted to do a big profile on me, but I said no.

14
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,720
<1-11,Ross>为什么
<1-11,Ross>Why'd you say no?

15
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,600
<1-12,Joey>还记得我上次接受采访的结果吗
<1-12,Joey>Remember what happened the last time I did an interview for them?

16
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:43,770
<1-12,Joey>我说我自己写了不少台词  编剧抓狂了
<1-12,Joey>I said I write a lot of my own lines, the writers got mad...

17
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:46,770
<1-12,Joey>让我的角色摔下了电梯间
<1-12,Joey>and made my character fall down the elevator shaft.

18
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:49,120
<1-12,Joey>谁知道这次我会说什么
<1-12,Joey>So who knows what I might say this time.

19
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,790
<1-13,Chandler>要是你脑子里有种东西
<1-13,Chandler>If only there was something in your head

20
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:52,810
<1-13,Chandler>能控制你说的每句话就好了
<1-13,Chandler>to control the things you say.

21
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:57,340
<1-14,Rachel>少来了  这次你会表现得很好
<1-14,Rachel>Come on, Joey, you'll totally keep it in check this time.

22
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:58,670
<1-14,Rachel>而且这种宣传造势
<1-14,Rachel>And plus, you know the publicity

23
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,500
<1-14,Rachel>对你的事业也很有帮助
<1-14,Rachel>would be really good for your career.

24
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,070
<1-14,Rachel>这是你应得的
<1-14,Rachel>You deserve that.

25
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:05,030
<1-14,Rachel>在专访里  你可以提到
<1-14,Rachel>And if you do the interview, you could mention,

26
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,890
<1-14,Rachel>"女性朋友瑞秋·格林"
<1-14,Rachel>I don't know, "gal pal Rachel Green."

27
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,840
<1-15,Chandler>"女性朋友"的意思是失败者吗
<1-15,Chandler>Is that "gal pal" spelled L-O-S-E-R?

28
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,910
<1-16,Rachel>好吧  别听他的  拜托
<1-16,Rachel>Okay, don't listen to him. Please?

29
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,370
<1-17,Joey>好吧  我接受采访
<1-17,Joey>Fine, all right, I'll do it.

30
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:19,170
<1-17,Joey>但你们都得坐在旁边
<1-17,Joey>But you guys have to be at the next table

31
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,450
<1-17,Joey>我要是开始说蠢话  就及时阻止我
<1-17,Joey>so you can stop me if I start to say something stupid.

32
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:24,640
<1-18,Ross>你只指专访时还是一辈子
<1-18,Ross>Just then, or all the time?

33
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,550
<1-18,Ross>因为我们还得去上班
<1-18,Ross>Because we have jobs, you know?

34
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:31,930
<1-19,Rachel>我们会一直在场的  但你得记住
<1-19,Rachel>We'll be there for you the whole time. Just remember:

35
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:34,580
<1-19,Rachel>女性朋友瑞秋·格林
<1-19,Rachel>Gal pal, Rachel Green.

37
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:40,530
<1-19,Rachel>不只是上那个愚蠢的字谜游戏
<1-19,Rachel>And not just in the dumb crossword puzzle.

38
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:43,340
<1-19,Rachel>我真的以你为荣
<1-19,Rachel>Seriously, proud of you.

<2-2,Joey>Not at all. Happy to do it.

52
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:33,140
<2-2,Joey>你们觉得我们做得很明显吗
<2-2,Joey>You think we're being obvious?

53
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,930
<3-1,Monica>不  我们只是四个脖子有问题
<3-1,Monica>No. We're just four people with neck problems,

54
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,580
<3-2,Chandler>说话不正常的人

56
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:44,110
<3-2,Chandler>大多数人听说餐费会由杂志社来买单
<3-2,Chandler>When most people hear the magazine's paying for it,

57
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,640
<3-2,Chandler>都会约到高级大餐厅
<3-2,Chandler>they want a big, fancy restaurant.

58
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:50,600
<4-1,The Interviewer>我真的不知道杂志社会买单
<4-1,The Interviewer>Actually, I didn't know the magazine was paying.

59
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,260
<4-2,Joey>那不重要
<4-2,Joey>Wouldn't have mattered.

60
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:56,360
<4-2,Joey>我这么做是为了影迷  不是为了白吃
<4-2,Joey>I do this for the fans, not the free food.

<6-3,Host>You go to the refrigerator to get a nice glass of milk,

74
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,320

87
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,180
<6-9,Joey>我却一点都不会变老
<6-9,Joey>But I won't have aged at all.

88
00:04:54,970 --> 00:05:00,290
<6-9,Joey>你得要你的曾曾孙女来找我
<6-9,Joey>So you tell your great-great- granddaughter to look me up.

94
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,350
<6-10,Joey>心想"我该怎么办"
<6-10,Joey>I'm thinking, "What do I do? What do I do?"

95
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,360
<6-10,Joey>所以我就看着他们做爱
<6-10,Joey>So I just watch them have sex.

<17-9,Joey>别浪费  这毕竟还是食物  天啊
<17-9,Joey>Well, don't waste it. I mean, it's still food. Jeez!

242
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,870
<18-1,Ross>我对这件事有深深的罪恶感
<18-1,Ross>I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this,

243
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:15,370
<18-1,Ross>我想当个好朋友  我本来就是个好朋友
<18-1,Ross>because I wanna be a good friend and damn it, I am a good friend.

244
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:17,950
<18-1,Ross>闭上你的嘴巴跟眼睛
<18-1,Ross>So just shut up and close your eyes.

245
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,070
<18-2,Joey>你确实是个好朋友
<18-2,Joey>You are a good friend.

246

<18-2,Joey>我今天早上去试镜  但我失败了
<18-2,Joey>The audition was this morning, and I didn't get it.

247
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:35,570
<18-2,Joey>但那个吻真的很棒  瑞秋真是个幸运的姑娘
<18-2,Joey>But that was a hell of a kiss. Rachel is a very lucky girl.

248
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,720
<18-3,Joey>请参赛者离开隔离间
<18-3,Joey>Let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths.

252
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:53,540
<18-7,Joey>鸭子找到花生酱饼干了
<18-7,Joey>The duck gets the Nutter Butter!

253
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:57,830
<18-8,Phoebe>不  那不是花生酱饼干  那是以前掉的馄饨
<18-8,Phoebe>No! That's not a Nutter-Butter, that's just an old Wonton!

254
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,950
<18-9,Joey>裁判判决是花生酱饼干
<18-9,Joey>Judge rules: Nutter Butter!

255
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,990
<18-10,Phoebe>黑哨
<18-10,Phoebe>Tough call.

256
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,880
<18-12,Joey>我在探索频道看到过
<18-12,Joey>I'd seen this thing on The Discovery Channel.

257

260
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,650
<18-13,Ross>你往自己身上尿尿了
<18-13,Ross>You peed on yourself?

261
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,510
<18-15,Monica>别那么说  你不了解那有多痛
<18-15,Monica>You can't say that! You don't know!

262
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:27,800
<18-15,Monica>我以为我会痛得昏过去
<18-15,Monica>I thought I'd pass out from the pain.

263
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:33,110
<18-15,Monica>总之我试过了  但我没办法那样子弯曲身子
<18-15,Monica>Anyway, I tried, but I couldn't bend that way.

264
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,880
<18-15,Monica>所以
<18-15,Monica>So...

<18-16,Joey>她是我的朋友  她需要帮忙
<18-16,Joey>She's my friend and she needed help!

267
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:54,190
<18-16,Joey>有必要的话  我可以往你们任何人身上尿尿
<18-16,Joey>If I had to, I'd pee on any one of you!

268
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:01,390
<19-1,Joey>不  我没有最好的朋友
<19-1,Joey>Nope. No best friend.

<19-2,The Interviewer>有那么多男同志支持你  你有什么感觉
<19-2,The Interviewer>How does it feel to have a huge gay fan base?

272
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:14,670
<19-3,Joey>真的吗  我

277
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,680
<20-1,Chandler>刚开始我只觉得它好看  但它还很实用
<20-1,Chandler>At first, I thought it just looked good, but it's practical, too.
