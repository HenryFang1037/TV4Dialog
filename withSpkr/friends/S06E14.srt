41
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,780

<2-11,Rachel>Was it the "please don't show me another picture of a trilobite" vibe?

48
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,690
<2-12,Ross>总之
<2-12,Ross>Anyway....

49
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,780

<3-4,Chandler>哭ET就算了
<3-4,Chandler>Well, that l can see crying over,

89
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:23,710

00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:33,790
<3-7,Monica>钱德勒  哭没什么不对
<3-7,Monica>Chandler, there is nothing wrong with crying.

<3-7,Monica>你不必老是那么男儿有泪不轻弹
<3-7,Monica>You don't have to be macho all the time.

<3-13,Joey>What if the puppy said, "help me, Chandler.

105
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:08,470
<3-13,Joey>其他的狗狗都欺负我"
<3-13,Joey>all the other puppies pick on me."

162
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:06,480
<5-7,Jill>可能是因为我不够成熟

<5-7,Jill>不够聪明
<5-7,Jill>or smart enough.

<6-16,Joey>布里克街的成人录影带店
<6-16,Joey>Down at the adult video place on Bleecker.

214
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:38,600
<6-17,Ross>我看到乔伊正要进去  就先跑进去躲着
<6-17,Ross>And l saw Joey was about to go in, so l ran in ahead of him...

215
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,820
<6-17,Ross>想吓吓他
<6-17,Ross>...to surprise him.

216
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:46,180
<6-17,Ross>然后再假装不知道他也在
<6-17,Ross>Then l pretended that l didn't know he was in there.

217
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,810
<6-18,Rachel>天啊  我真是不敢相信

<6-18,Rachel>真是知人知面不知心啊
<6-18,Rachel>You know, l mean, you think you know someone.

219
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:58,680
<6-18,Rachel>虽然我们知道菲比很神秘  但这也...
<6-18,Rachel>Even Phoebe, who's always been somewhat of a question mark.

220
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,010
<6-19,Monica>这也太悲剧了吧
<6-19,Monica>This is so bizarre.

221
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:04,140
<6-19,Monica>不过也说得通
<6-19,Monica>l guess it kind of makes sense, though. You know,

222
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,900
<6-19,Monica>毕竟她的童年那么悲惨
<6-19,Monica>She had such a terrible childhood.

223
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,520
<6-20,Chandler>我童年悲惨  也没去拍黄片啊
<6-20,Chandler>l had a bad childhood and l don't do porn.

224
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,720
<6-21,Monica>对  但是你的心死了
<6-21,Monica>Yes, but you're dead inside.

225
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:14,290
<6-22,Joey>我还是拿去还了吧
<6-22,Joey>l'd better take that back.

226
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:15,520
<6-23,Monica>为什么  干嘛还了
<6-23,Monica>What, why? Why?

227
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:18,200
<6-24,Joey>我们不能看  那是菲比演的
<6-24,Joey>We can't watch it. I mean that's Phoebe.

228
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,610
<6-25,Monica>你说得对  我们不能  也不该看
<6-25,Monica>Yeah, you're right. We can't, we shouldn't watch this.

00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:22,950
<6-26,Rachel>没错  还回去吧
<6-26,Rachel>Absolutely not. That goes back.

230
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,070
<6-28,Rachel>-看一点好了  -前半段就好
<6-28,Rachel>- Maybe a bit. - How about just the first half?

231
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,950
<6-29,Joey>这样是不对的
<6-29,Joey>This is wrong, you guys!

232
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,430
<6-29,Joey>菲比是我们的朋友
<6-29,Joey>Phoebe's our friend!

233
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:32,760
<6-29,Joey>-我不要看  -没错
<6-29,Joey>- l'm not gonna watch it. - Yeah!

234
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:34,510
<6-30,Ross>乔伊  真有义气
<6-30,Ross>Good for you, Joe.

<6-32,The Vampire>into my dark places?

238
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:02,250
<6-32,The Vampire>其实我有点希望是你来插
<6-32,The Vampire>Actually, l was kind of hoping it would be the other way around.

239
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,640
<7-1,Monica>等等  她的脚踝上是什么
<7-1,Monica>Hold on a second. What's that on her ankle?

240
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,520
<7-2,Chandler>你居然是在注意她的脚踝啊
<7-2,Chandler>Her ankle is what you're watching?

241
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:12,110
<7-3,Rachel>很难看得出来
<7-3,Rachel>Well, it's hard to tell.

242
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:15,550
<7-3,Rachel>她能不能不要动了
<7-3,Rachel>God, if she would just stop moving.

243
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:18,290
<7-4,Chandler>她只是在尽本分
<7-4,Chandler>She's just doing her job.

<8-13,Monica>而你没有哭  那又怎样

348
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:55,090

<14-8,Ross>我尽量不去亲她了  好吗
<14-8,Ross>Look, l tried not to kiss her, okay?

00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:51,620
<14-10,Ross>她主动来亲我
<14-10,Ross>She started kissing me...

385
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:54,390
<14-10,Ross>我没有阻止
<14-10,Ross>...and l didn't stop it.

386
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:56,240
<14-10,Ross>我当时没用脑吧
<14-10,Ross>l guess l just wasn't thinking.

<14-11,Rachel>是啊  没错  你没用脑
<14-11,Rachel>Yeah. That's right you weren't thinking.

390
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:05,060
<14-12,Ross>后来我一想  就把她推开了
<14-12,Ross>But then l started thinking and l stopped the kissing.

391
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:08,500
<14-13,Rachel>谢谢你把舌头从我妹的嘴里缩回来
<14-13,Rachel>Well, thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister's mouth,

00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,920
<14-13,Rachel>还来告知我啊
<14-13,Rachel>long enough to tell me that.

393
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:16,440
<14-14,Ross>我是想到  如果我跟吉尔有怎样
<14-14,Ross>Look, l realized if anything happened with me and Jill...

394
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,970
<14-14,Ross>我们就再也不能有其他发展了
<14-14,Ross>...then nothing could ever happen with us.

395
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,970
<14-14,Ross>-什么  -我是说
<14-14,Ross>- What? - No, l mean....

<14-14,Ross>我不知道我们以后会如何
<14-14,Ross>l don't know if anything is ever going to happen with us...

397
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,050
<14-16,Ross>还会不会有什么
<14-16,Ross>...again, ever.

398
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:32,960
<14-16,Ross>但我不想断绝这个可能性
<14-16,Ross>But l don't want to know that it never could.

399
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:35,430
<14-16,Ross>于是我喊停
<14-16,Ross>So l stopped it...

400
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:39,770
<14-16,Ross>然后...她气得摔坏我的投影机
<14-16,Ross>...and she got mad and broke my projector.

401
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,830
<14-17,Rachel>我都不知道该说什么了
<14-17,Rachel>l don't even know what to say.

<14-20,Chandler>好  我要走了
<14-20,Chandler>All right, l'm leaving.

407
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,670
