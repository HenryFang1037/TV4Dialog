00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,360
<2-16,Monica>你是在陶瓷大谷仓买的

<2-17,Rachel>对  这叫药师桌
<2-17,Rachel>Yeah. lt's an apothecary table.

50
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:37,710
<2-17,Rachel>有谁知道药师是什么吗
<2-17,Rachel>Does anyone even know what an apothecary is?

51

<2-18,Chandler>药剂师
<2-18,Chandler>A pharmacist.

52

<2-19,Monica>瑞秋  菲比最讨厌陶瓷大谷仓了
<2-19,Monica>Rach, Phoebe hates Pottery Barn.

55
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:51,340
<2-20,Joey>我才在床上坐坐  就被赶出去了
<2-20,Joey>They kicked me out just because I sat on a bed.

56
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:54,340
<2-21,Chandler>那是因为你脱了裤子钻进被子里
<2-21,Chandler>You took off your pants and climbed under the sheets.

57
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,580
<2-22,Joey>我累了
<2-22,Joey>I was tired.

58
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,410
<2-23,Rachel>菲比讨厌陶瓷大谷仓吗
<2-23,Rachel>Phoebe hates Pottery Barn?

59
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,420
<2-24,Monica>大批量生产的东西她都讨厌
<2-24,Monica>Yeah, she hates all mass produced stuff.

60
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:07,730
<2-24,Monica>她认为家具都应该有历史  有典故
<2-24,Monica>She thinks her furniture should have a history, a story behind it.

61
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:10,050
<2-25,Rachel>它是有典故啊
<2-25,Rachel>Well this has story behind it!

62
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:14,010
<2-25,Rachel>这桌子可是大老远从白原店运来的
<2-25,Rachel>I mean they had to ship it all the way from the White Plains store.

63
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:19,170
<2-26,Monica>她喜欢独一无二的东西  比如像
<2-26,Monica>It's gotta be one of a kind. You know like umm,

64
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:23,550
<2-26,Monica>她柜台上那个丑到爆的水果陶碗吗
<2-26,Monica>you know uh, what's that God awful ceramic fruit bowl she has on her counter?

65
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:26,710
<2-27,Joey>那可是我做的
<2-27,Joey>Hey! I made that for her.

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,780
<2-28,Chandler>-你会做陶瓷吗  -当然
<2-28,Chandler>- You made pottery? - Yeah.

67
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:33,060
<2-29,Joey>我从垃圾堆捡来的水果碗做的
<2-29,Joey>I made it out of a fruit bowl I found in the garbage.

68
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,490
<2-30,Monica>相信我  你要是把桌子搬回家
<2-30,Monica>I'm telling-If you put that in her apartment,

69
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:38,040
<2-30,Monica>她肯定会抱怨不休的
<2-30,Monica>you'll never hear the end of it.

70
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,380
<2-31,Rachel>好吧  我就说那是张古董药师桌
<2-31,Rachel>Okay fine! I'll-I'll just tell her it's an antique apothecary table,

71
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,830
<2-31,Rachel>她不必知道它的出处
<2-31,Rachel>She doesn't have to know where it came from.

72
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,160
<2-31,Rachel>我好喜欢这些小抽屉
<2-31,Rachel>I love these little drawers.

73
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,470
<2-31,Rachel>上面说可以放三百张CD呢
<2-31,Rachel>Oh, look! lt says that it holds 300 CDs.

74
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:52,530
<2-32,Chandler>正如往昔的药师桌一样
<2-32,Chandler>Just like the apothecary tables of yore.

75
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,320
<3-1,Chandler>然后农夫说
<3-1,Chandler>So the farmer says:

76
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,580
<3-1,Chandler>"那不是母牛  你也不是在挤奶"
<3-1,Chandler>"That's not a cow, and you're not milking."

<5-13,Phoebe>跳蚤市场居然卖到5百元
<5-13,Phoebe>Five hundred bucks at a flea market?

<5-14,Rachel>-就是当时的价钱  -不是
<5-14,Rachel>- You know like back then. - No.

125

<5-17,Phoebe>-1块钱  -再加50元
<5-17,Phoebe>- A dollar? - And 50?

00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:23,200
<5-25,Phoebe>真是一个充满魔力的地名

145
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,630
<6-7,Rachel>不能让她看到这桌子
<6-7,Rachel>She can't see this.

146
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,370
<6-8,Ross>为什么  她一定会喜欢
<6-8,Ross>Why not? She'll love it.

147
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:44,580
<6-8,Ross>这可是好东西
<6-8,Ross>It's the real thing.

148
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,490
<6-8,Ross>是在陶瓷大谷仓买的
<6-8,Ross>I got it at Pottery Barn.

00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,860
<6-9,Rachel>我知道  我也买了一张
<6-9,Rachel>I know you did! I bought the same one!

150
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,750
<6-9,Rachel>如果她看到你的桌子  就会知道我骗她
<6-9,Rachel>And if she sees your table she's gonna know that I lied to her.

151
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,250
<6-9,Rachel>因为我说我们的是原版
<6-9,Rachel>I said ours was an original.

152
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,580
<6-10,Ross>你为什么这么说
<6-10,Ross>Why did you do that?

153
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:57,810
<6-11,Rachel>因为她讨厌陶瓷大谷仓
<6-11,Rachel>Because she hates Pottery Barn.

154
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:01,110
<6-12,Ross>她居然讨厌陶瓷大谷仓
<6-12,Ross>She hates Pottery Barn?

155
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,010
<6-12,Ross>我知道  我也很惊讶
<6-12,Ross>I know! I know,

156
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:05,230
<6-13,Rachel>她说批量生产的东西  粗制滥造
<6-13,Rachel>She says it's all mass- produced nothing is authentic,

157
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:07,600
<6-13,Rachel>而且家家户户都有相同的东西
<6-13,Rachel>and everyone winds up having the same stuff.

158
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,420
<6-7,Rachel>快点  她随时会进来
<6-7,Rachel>So come on! she's gonna be here any second!

159
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,270
<6-13,Rachel>能不能拿个东西盖住它  拜托你了
<6-13,Rachel>Can we please just cover this up with something?! Please?

160
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,330
<6-14,Ross>什么  我不要
<6-14,Ross>What? No! No! I

161
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:17,750
<6-14,Ross>我才不要对菲比遮遮掩掩的
<6-14,Ross>I am not gonna hide it from Phoebe.

162
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,930
<6-14,Ross>不过我在陶瓷大谷仓买了很漂亮的床单
<6-14,Ross>Although I did get some great Pottery Barn sheets.

163
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:24,430
<6-15,Rachel>哎呀  我都忘了他们也有出床单
<6-15,Rachel>Oh, I forgot they made sheets!

164
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:31,410
<6-16,Ross>真不敢相信她居然讨厌陶瓷大谷仓
<6-16,Ross>I still can't believe she hates Pottery Barn.

165
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,520
<6-17,Rachel>罗斯  别念叨了  她又不是讨厌你
<6-17,Rachel>Ross, get over it! It's not like she hates you.

166
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,830
<6-18,Ross>但讨厌陶瓷大谷仓也太...
<6-18,Ross>Yeah, but Pottery Barn?

167
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,930
<6-18,Ross>我觉得根本是她怪胎
<6-18,Ross>You know what I think? She's just weird.

168
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:44,190
<6-18,Ross>因为她是双胞胎  双胞胎都很怪
<6-18,Ross>It's because she's a twin. Twins are weird.

169
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:47,130
<6-19,Rachel>她不是怪
<6-19,Rachel>Ross, she's not weird,

170
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:49,350
<6-19,Rachel>她只是希望她的东西独一无二
<6-19,Rachel>she just likes her stuff to be one of a kind.

171
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,900
<6-20,Ross>什么最不独一无二  双胞胎
<6-20,Ross>You know what's not one-of-a-kind? A twin!

172
00:08:58,090 --> 00:08:58,930
<6-23,Ross>菲比来了
<6-23,Ross>Ooh, Phoebe's here!

<8-6,Chandler>她为什么不想跟我们玩
<8-6,Chandler>Why doesn't she want to hang out with us?

204
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:49,000
<8-7,Joey>因为她觉得你很爱说废话

209
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,720
<8-9,Chandler>她居然当面骗我们
<8-9,Chandler>She was lying to our faces?

210
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,540
<8-10,Monica>太扯了  她凭什么批评我们
<8-10,Monica>I can't believe this. Who is she to judge us?

211
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,950
<8-10,Monica>我们对她多好
<8-10,Monica>We couldn't have been nicer to her.

<8-11,Chandler>我才不爱说废话  我是谈笑风生
<8-11,Chandler>And I am not blah. I am a hoot!

<8-11,Chandler>她之所以这么说
<8-11,Chandler>I'm sure she just, she just said that stuff

215
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:17,990
<8-12,Joey>一定是因为她紧张
<8-12,Joey>...because she was nervous

216
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:20,090
<8-12,Joey>因为你们是我最要好的朋友
<8-12,Joey>because you guys are like my best friends.

221
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,900
<8-14,Joey>比看戏好吗
<8-14,Joey>is way better than the play thing?

00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:34,690
<8-15,Chandler>都很好
<8-15,Chandler>They're both good.

223
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:37,060
<8-15,Chandler>我通常都说"莫妮卡又醉了"
<8-15,Chandler>I generally just go with, "Monica's drunk again."

224
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,920
<8-16,Joey>你们大人不记小人过
<8-16,Joey>Come on you guys, come on please

<10-13,Joey>你们刚开始交往时  我可是帮了你们不少忙
<10-13,Joey>I helped you guys out a lot in the start of your relationship.

264
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,170
<10-13,Joey>我帮你们偷偷交往了半年
<10-13,Joey>I helped you sneak around for six months.

265
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:51,900
<10-13,Joey>跟白痴一样
<10-13,Joey>I looked like an idiot.

266
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,740
<10-13,Joey>我觉得很丢脸
<10-13,Joey>And I was humiliated.

267
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,860
<10-13,Joey>还只挣了两百元
<10-13,Joey>And I only made $200.

268
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,940
<10-14,Monica>我们没有给你一分钱
<10-14,Monica>We didn't give you any money.

00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,260
<10-15,Joey>你以为我不知道吗
<10-15,Joey>You don't think I know that?

270
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,840
<11-1,Rachel>我不知道该拿它
<11-1,Rachel>See? I can't decide whether it would go better

271
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,860
<11-1,Rachel>配巫师餐椅
<11-1,Rachel>next to the new wicker dining chair,

272
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,230
<11-1,Rachel>撒哈拉书桌
<11-1,Rachel>...the Sahara desk...

273
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:16,450
<11-1,Rachel>还是派克饭桌
<11-1,Rachel>...or the Parker console table.

274
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:19,230
<11-2,Ross>这里相当于小型陶瓷大谷仓了
<11-2,Ross>I didn't know there was a Pottery Barn up here.

275
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,750
<11-3,Rachel>-我知道  我有点买疯了  -才有点吗
<11-3,Rachel>- I know,  I know, I went a little crazy. - A little?

276
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,740
<11-4,Ross>你的屋子就跟产品目录第七十二页差不多
<11-4,Ross>Your place looks like page 72 of the catalogue.

277
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:28,550
<11-4,Ross>看这个
<11-4,Ross>Look at that!

00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:32,360
<11-4,Ross>装饰鸟笼  大号的

279
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,660
<11-7,Phoebe>罗斯  小心  那个很旧
<11-7,Phoebe>Oh, Ross? Be careful. That is very old.

280
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,250
<11-7,Phoebe>殖民地时代早期的鸟商
<11-7,Phoebe>Early Colonial bird merchants used to

281
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,910
<11-7,Phoebe>都用它带鸟上市场
<11-7,Phoebe>bring their birds to market in that.

282
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,100
<11-8,Ross>有意思

<11-9,Phoebe>-它一定也有很棒的典故  -没错
<11-9,Phoebe>- I bet this has a great story too. - lt does. lt does.

285
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:59,610
<11-10,Rachel>这是殖民地时期分隔房间的装置
<11-10,Rachel>It is a room-separating apparatus from Colonial times.

286
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:04,800
<11-11,Phoebe>有好多东西都来自殖民地时期
<11-11,Phoebe>A lot of this stuff is from the Colonial times.

287
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:07,880
<11-12,Ross>能列举几个其他时期的名称吗  瑞秋
<11-12,Ross>What are some other time periods, Rachel?

288
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:11,950
<11-13,Rachel>有往昔时期
<11-13,Rachel>Well, there's yore.

289
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,580
<11-13,Rachel>还有昨年时期
<11-13,Rachel>And, you know, yesteryear.

290
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,920
<11-14,Phoebe>瑞秋对这种东西真的很有眼光
<11-14,Phoebe>Yeah no, I'm telling you Rachel has such a good eye for this stuff.

291
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,820
<11-14,Phoebe>罗斯  如果你家要重新布置
<11-14,Phoebe>Ross, if you ever decide to redecorate...

292
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,510
<11-14,Phoebe>而且我觉得很有必要
<11-14,Phoebe>...and I think you should...

293
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,190
<11-14,Phoebe>你应该找瑞秋帮忙
<11-14,Phoebe>...you should ask Rachel to help.

294
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:32,120
<11-15,Rachel>亲爱的  他才不需要我的帮忙
<11-15,Rachel>Oh honey he doesn't need my help.

295
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,220
<11-16,Phoebe>拜托  他早该扔掉那些...
<11-16,Phoebe>Oh, come on! I think he's ready to get rid of,

296
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,370
<11-16,Phoebe>你怎么称呼来着
<11-16,Phoebe>What did you call it?

297
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:38,470
<11-16,Phoebe>"便宜山寨货  恐龙时期的垃圾"
<11-16,Phoebe>The "cheap knockoffs and dinosaur junk"?

298
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:44,240
<11-16,Phoebe>真的吗
<11-16,Phoebe>Really?

299
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,880
<11-17,Ross>你知道吗
<11-17,Ross>You know what,

300
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:49,400
<11-17,Ross>既然你这么清楚我的需求
<11-17,Ross>since you have such a great sense of what I need- -

00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,690
<11-17,Ross>我这里有六十元
<11-17,Ross>Here's 60 bucks.

302
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:56,060
<11-17,Ross>你带着菲比  去殖民时期的跳蚤市场
<11-17,Ross>Why don't you take Phoebe down to that Colonial flea market

303
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,010
<11-17,Ross>帮我买几件家具吧
<11-17,Ross>...and get me some stuff.

304
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,710
<11-18,Rachel>其实  我觉得菲比不会想去
<11-18,Rachel>You know what? I don't, I don't really think Phoebe wants to come.

305
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:06,690
<11-19,Phoebe>-不  我想去  -她想去
<11-19,Phoebe>- No, I do want to. - She does want to.

<12-1,Rachel>菲比  我真不知道说什么
<12-1,Rachel>Pheebs, I don't know what to say.

308
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:18,440
<12-1,Rachel>上次跳蚤市场的好东西比较多
<12-1,Rachel>I guess the flea market was just better last time.

309
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,470
<12-2,Phoebe>-至少我帮罗斯买了床单  -没错
<12-2,Phoebe>- Well, at least I got these sheets for Ross. - Yeah.

<12-5,Rachel>-真的  别看了  -快看
<12-5,Rachel>- Seriously, don't look at it. - Look!

<12-6,Phoebe>你看  他们抄袭我们的咖啡桌
<12-6,Phoebe>There's the table they stole from us.

<12-7,Rachel>Let's go.

316
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:39,920
<12-8,Phoebe>那台电风扇跟我们的有点像
<12-8,Phoebe>That fan kind of looks like ours

317
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,410
<12-8,Phoebe>还有那个鸟笼和...
<12-8,Phoebe>and the birdcage and....

318
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,490
<12-8,Phoebe>这根本就是我们的客厅
<12-8,Phoebe>Wait a second, this is our exact living room!

319
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:48,470
<12-8,Phoebe>不  才不是呢  不一样啦
<12-8,Phoebe>No! No! No! No it's not! No it's not!

<12-9,Rachel>我们没有...我们没有那盏灯
<12-9,Rachel>I mean, we don't have the-- We don't have that lamp.

322
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:59,800
<12-9,Rachel>还有那扇隔板是在另一边
<12-9,Rachel>And that screen is, you know,on the other side.

323
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:02,850
<12-9,Rachel>我的老天
<12-9,Rachel>Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:04,250
<12-10,Phoebe>我们家具都是在这里买的
<12-10,Phoebe>This is where you got all our stuff.

325
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,280
<12-10,Phoebe>陶瓷大谷仓  我的天啊
<12-10,Phoebe>Pottery Barn! Oh, my God!

<12-11,Rachel>菲比  我想要这些东西
<12-11,Rachel>Phoebe, I wanted this stuff.

328
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,550
<12-11,Rachel>又知道你讨厌陶瓷大谷仓
<12-11,Rachel>And I know how you feel about Pottery Barn.

<12-12,Phoebe>-别气了  -可我就是生气  我气死了
<12-12,Phoebe>- Come on, don't be mad. - No-no-no, but I am mad! I am mad!

<12-12,Phoebe>这些东西就是现在社会的问题
<12-12,Phoebe>Because this stuff is everything that is wrong with the world!

331
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,280
<12-12,Phoebe>而他们都在我家客厅摆着
<12-12,Phoebe>And it's all sitting up in my living room

332
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,760
<12-12,Phoebe>但我却只想着我没有那盏灯
<12-12,Phoebe>and all I can think about is how I don't have that lamp!

333
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,580
<12-13,Rachel>那就买下那盏灯
<12-13,Rachel>Well, then, honey, buy the lamp.

<12-14,Phoebe>Unless....

337
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,480
<12-16,Phoebe>你是说我不买那盏灯  你就要搬走吗
<12-16,Phoebe>Are you saying you'd move out if I didn't buy that lamp?

338
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:45,560
<12-15,Rachel>不  我不会搬走
<12-15,Rachel>No, I'm not gonna move out!

339
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,150
<12-16,Phoebe>你是说我不买那盏灯
<12-16,Phoebe>But are you saying that you would move out

340
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,360
<12-16,Phoebe>你就要搬走吗
<12-16,Phoebe>if I didn't buy that lamp?

<12-18,Phoebe>-唯有买下那盏灯  -没错
<12-18,Phoebe>- I have to buy that lamp! - That's right.

344
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:01,400
<12-20,Phoebe>不过至少那张药师桌是真的古董
<12-20,Phoebe>But at least the apothecary table's real.

350
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:18,870
<13-2,Janine>可能是紧张或什么的吧
<13-2,Janine>I guess I was just nervous or something.

<13-4,Monica>-我们完全理解  -对啊  别放在心上
