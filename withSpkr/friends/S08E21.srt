1
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:06,580
<1-1,Ross>-伙计们  有个坏消息  -什么
<1-1,Ross>- Hey, you guys. I got some bad news. - What?

2
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:08,430
<1-2,Phoebe>这样怎么卖得出去报纸
<1-2,Phoebe>That's no way to sell newspapers.

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:11,210
<1-2,Phoebe>试试"号外  号外  快来买啊"
<1-2,Phoebe>Try, "Extra! Extra! Read all about it!"

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,540
<1-3,Ross>不  莫妮卡的餐厅在纽约邮报上的评价很差
<1-3,Ross>No. Monica's restaurant got a horrible review in the Post.

5
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:18,340
<1-3,Ross>我不希望她看到
<1-3,Ross>I didn't want her to see it,

6
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:21,670
<1-3,Ross>所以跑遍附近报摊买下了所有报纸
<1-3,Ross>so I ran around and bought all the copies I could find.

7
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,780
<1-4,Joey>确实很糟糕  我一直都被批得很凶
<1-4,Joey>This is bad. And I've had my bad share of bad reviews.

8
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:28,640
<1-4,Joey>我还记得我第一次被赞美
<1-4,Joey>I still remember my first good one, though:

9
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,460
<1-4,Joey>《我们的小镇》的其他所有方面
<1-4,Joey>"Everything else in this production of Our Town

10
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:32,230
<1-4,Joey>都很差劲
<1-4,Joey>was simply terrible.

11
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:35,070
<1-4,Joey>乔伊·崔比安尼无可救药
<1-4,Joey>Joey Tribbiani was abysmal."

12
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,820
<1-6,Chandler>我的天啊  看看这些报纸
<1-6,Chandler>Oh, my God! Look at all the newspapers.

13
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,480
<1-7,Monica>评价一定很不错  对吧
<1-7,Monica>It must be a good review. Is it great?

14
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,230
<1-9,Monica>我的天啊
<1-9,Monica>Oh, dear God.

15
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:54,050
<1-10,Ross>但好消息是方圆两条街内
<1-10,Ross>But the good news is, no one in a two-block radius

16
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:55,770
<1-10,Ross>没有人会知道
<1-10,Ross>will ever know.

17
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,720
<1-11,Monica>-曼哈顿其他的人呢   -他们都会知道
<1-11,Monica>- What about the rest of Manattan? - They all know.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,230
<1-13,Monica>天啊  这太可怕了  我觉得好丢脸
<1-13,Monica>Oh, my God, this is horrible. I'm so humiliated.

19
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:06,610
<1-14,Chandler>人家不是说嘛
<1-14,Chandler>Yeah, but you know what they say, Mon,

20
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:08,830
<1-16,Rachel>没有所谓的负面报导
<1-16,Rachel>there's no such thing as bad press.

21
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:13,040
<1-17,Monica>你不觉得"主厨做的鬼头刀难吃极了"
<1-17,Monica>You don't think that umm, "The chef's Mahi Mahi was awful awful,"

22
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,620
<1-17,Monica>是负面报导吗
<1-17,Monica>is bad press?

23
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,800
<1-18,Rachel>那又不是我写的
<1-18,Rachel>I didn't write it.

24
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:22,380
<1-19,Monica>-天啊  他说得对吗  我很逊吗   -不
<1-19,Monica>- God, is he right? Am I awful? - Oh, no!

25
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:24,480
<1-20,All>莫妮卡  听我说
<1-20,All>Monica, you listen to me, okay?

26
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:26,140
<1-21,Joey>我这么说不是因为我是你朋友
<1-21,Joey>I'm not just saying this because I'm your friend.

27
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:27,960
<1-21,Joey>而是因为这是事实
<1-21,Joey>I'm saying it 'cause it's the truth.

28
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,260
<1-21,Joey>你的菜品无可救药
<1-21,Joey>Your food is abysmal!

40
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,080
<2-2,Ross>-罗斯  -怎么了
<2-2,Ross>- Ross? - What? What?

41
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,350
<2-3,Rachel>-我好心慌啊  -是吗
<2-3,Rachel>- I am freaking out! - Are you?

42
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,840
<2-5,Rachel>我的预产期就在一星期后
<2-5,Rachel>My due date is in one week!

43
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,500
<2-7,Rachel>-你为什么不睡觉   -只剩七天
<2-7,Rachel>- What are you doing up? - That is seven days.

44
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:29,970
<2-8,Ross>我睡前喝了太多水
<2-8,Ross>Okay, look. I had a lot of water before I went to bed.

45
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:33,450
<2-9,Rachel>-我们能不能等会...  -不  罗斯
<2-9,Rachel>- Can we do this after...? - No, no, no, no, Ross!

46
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:36,110
<2-9,Rachel>所有大件用品我们都还没买
<2-9,Rachel>Please, come on we do not have any of the big stuff we need!

<2-9,Rachel>我们甚至没有尿布清洁回收服务
<2-9,Rachel>We do not have a diaper service.

49
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,430
<2-10,Ross>你现在提起尿布可真搞笑
<2-10,Ross>Funny you should mention diapers.

50
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:47,880
<2-11,Rachel>-我是认真的  -没什么好担心的
<2-11,Rachel>- I'm serious. - There's nothing to worry about.

128
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:46,410
<5-5,Rachel>有个女销售员开始对他调情

<5-25,Phoebe>-什么  -你不知道啊

<5-28,Chandler>我做了什么让你不爽
<5-28,Chandler>What is it that I do?

159
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:18,640
<5-29,Phoebe>你太刻意想要讲笑话
<5-29,Phoebe>It's just, like, you're trying too hard, always making jokes...

160
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,050
<5-29,Phoebe>你显得太心急了
<5-29,Phoebe>You just come off a little needy.

166
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,780

<6-3,Monica>我想让你再尝尝我做的马赛鱼汤

172
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:06,460

<6-7,The Food Critic>...between my integrity and my desire to avoid a beating.

173
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,930
<6-7,The Food Critic>但我得老实说

<12-2,Monica>You called me that before,

268
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:39,940
<12-2,Monica>所以我就擅作主张用铝箔纸做了一颗星星
<12-2,Monica>so I took the liberty and fashioned a star out of aluminium foil.

306
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,680

<13-10,The Interviewer>-那太好了  -我们可以进一步详谈

<13-15,Chandler>大家都说我太喜欢讲笑话缓和气氛
<13-15,Chandler>I'm told I come on too strongly, too many jokes.

317
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:28,220
<13-15,Chandler>要避开"职责"的问题真的很难
<13-15,Chandler>And then it was really hard to sidestep that "duty" thing.

318
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,590
<13-15,Chandler>责任
<13-15,Chandler>Duties?

325
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:51,730

<13-17,Chandler>This is just some crazy guy out in the hall.

00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,840
<14-4,Rachel>我很好  但那不重要
<14-4,Rachel>I'm fine. But that's not important.

331
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,030
<14-4,Rachel>重要的是她还好吗
<14-4,Rachel>What's important is how was she?

<14-5,Ross>玩得很高兴  我们一起去喝了咖啡
<14-5,Ross>It was fun. We just had coffee.

<14-6,Rachel>Oh, uh-huh, uh-huh, coffee, a little rub-rub-rub under the table?

334
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:28,640
<14-7,Ross>怎么了  你不喜欢凯蒂吗
<14-7,Ross>What's going on? Do you not like Katie?

335
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,420
<14-8,Rachel>不  她很好
<14-8,Rachel>No. No, she was nice.

336
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:33,750
<14-8,Rachel>就是有点淫荡  但谁不是呢
<14-8,Rachel>I mean, she was a little slutty, but who isn't?

337
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,130
<14-9,Ross>我喜欢她
<14-9,Ross>Well, I liked her.

338
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:37,430
<14-10,Rachel>你当然喜欢她
<14-10,Rachel>Of course you did, Ross.

339
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:39,030
<14-10,Rachel>哪怕是只猩猩叫你印第安纳·琼斯
<14-10,Rachel>You'd date a gorilla if it called you

340
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,950
<14-10,Rachel>你也会跟她约会
<14-10,Rachel>Indiana Jones.

341
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:45,860
<14-11,Ross>你的孕激素今天又分泌过剩了吗
<14-11,Ross>Did you get a fresh batch of pregnancy hormones today?

342
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:50,350
<14-12,Rachel>没有  只是...凯蒂让我觉得心烦
<14-12,Rachel>No. It's just that... Katie bothered me.

343
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,010
<14-13,Ross>为什么  她有哪里不好
<14-13,Ross>Why? What was wrong with her?

344
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,920
<14-14,Rachel>她没有哪里不好
<14-14,Rachel>There was nothing wrong with her, all right?

345
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,540
<14-14,Rachel>她非常可爱
<14-14,Rachel>She was perfectly lovely.

346
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,060
<14-15,Ross>好吧  那到底怎么了
<14-15,Ross>Okay. So, what's the matter?

<14-16,Rachel>我不希望你跟她约会
<14-16,Rachel>I don't want you to date her.

348
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:04,740
<14-17,Ross>为什么  你在吃醋吗
<14-17,Ross>Why? What, are you jealous?

349
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:08,810
<14-18,Rachel>对  但不是因为我想你跟我交住
<14-18,Rachel>Yes. And not because I want you to go out with me.

350
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:11,370
<14-18,Rachel>而是因为我不希望你跟任何人交住
<14-18,Rachel>Because I don't want you to go out with anybody.

351
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:14,400
<14-18,Rachel>我知道不该去想这种事情
<14-18,Rachel>I know it's a terrible thing to even think this

352
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:16,460
<14-18,Rachel>我也知道这样很不合适
<14-18,Rachel>and it's completely inappropriate...

353
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,760
<14-18,Rachel>但我希望你全天24小时都能随时
<14-18,Rachel>but I want you to be at my constant beck and call,

354
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,760
<14-18,Rachel>听从我的差遣
<14-18,Rachel>24 hours a day.

355
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,210
<14-18,Rachel>我非常抱歉  但这就是我的真实感觉
<14-18,Rachel>I'm very sorry, but that is just the way that I feel.

356
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:31,980
<14-15,Ross>-好吧  -什么
<14-15,Ross>- Okay. - What?

357
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:35,410
<14-16,Rachel>我不约会  我会
<14-16,Rachel>I won't date. I'll...

358
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:38,630
<14-21,Ross>我会一直陪着你
<14-21,Ross>I'll be here with you all the time.

359
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:41,820
<14-21,Ross>真的吗
<14-21,Ross>Really?

360
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,820
<14-22,Rachel>但我的要求很无理
<14-22,Rachel>But I'm being so unreasonable.

361
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:50,800
<14-23,Ross>没错  但你有资格无理取闹
<14-23,Ross>True, but you're allowed to be unreasonable.

362
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,310
<14-23,Ross>你怀了我们的宝宝
<14-23,Ross>You're having our baby.

363
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:00,720
<14-24,Rachel>罗斯  谢谢你
<14-24,Rachel>Oh, Ross, thank you. Thank you.

364
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,000
<14-25,Ross>你感觉好点了吗
<14-25,Ross>You feel better?

365
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,330
<14-26,Rachel>没有  你把宝宝压在我的膀胱上
<14-26,Rachel>No, not really. You're pressing the baby into my bladder...

366
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:13,110
<14-26,Rachel>我得去尿尿
<14-26,Rachel>...and now I have to pee.

367
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,650
<14-28,Rachel>-好吧  -瑞秋
<14-28,Rachel>- Okay. - Rach?

<14-31,Ross>我们住在一起  你怀了我们的孩子
<14-31,Ross>We live together. You're having our baby.

370
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:25,660
<14-31,Ross>我会不跟任何人约会
<14-31,Ross>I'm not gonna see anybody else.

371
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:28,640
<14-31,Ross>你确定你不想更进一步吗
<14-31,Ross>Are you sure you don't want something more?

372
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:36,210
<14-32,Rachel>我不知道  或许吧
<14-32,Rachel>Wow. I don't know, maybe...

373
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:38,850
<14-33,Ross>瑞秋  我只是在开你玩笑
<14-33,Ross>Oh, Rach, I was just messing around.

374
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,930
<14-33,Ross>就像昨晚我要尿尿你逗我那样
<14-33,Ross>Like you did last night when I had to pee?

<14-37,Ross>-不  那是...  -但你像是真的...
<14-37,Ross>- No, it's just... ...like you actually...

379
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:59,940
<14-38,Rachel>那只是因为我很会开玩笑
<14-38,Rachel>That's just because I'm such a good messer!

380
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:08,410
<14-39,Ross>-瑞秋  -什么
