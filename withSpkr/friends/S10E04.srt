<1-8,Ross>不要啊  那就不是她真正的生日
<1-8,Ross>No. It won't be her real birthday.

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,710
<1-9,Rachel>如果她就一岁
<1-9,Rachel>Gee, if only she were 1

11
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:27,760
<1-10,Chandler>也不知道生日到底是什么就好了
<1-10,Chandler>and had no idea what the hell a birthday was.

<1-11,Ross>这对我们很重要呢
<1-11,Ross>Come on, you guys, this is really important to us.

15
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:36,730
<1-12,Monica>我们想沟通沟通  心理上的
<1-12,Monica>...you know, to reconnect, emotionally.

16
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,610
<1-13,Chandler>我们从以前就很想做这件事
<1-13,Chandler>There's this thing I really want us to do.

18
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:40,330
<1-13,Chandler>我在《马克西姆》杂志看到的
<1-13,Chandler>I read about it in Maxim.

19
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:44,740
<1-14,Rachel>你们可以选择其他日子吧
<1-14,Rachel>Well, can't you just go to Vermont the next day?

<1-15,Ross>Yeah, we want everyone to be there.

21
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:48,840
<1-15,Ross>当然我也抱歉耽误你
<1-15,Ross>As much as I hate to delay your doing

22
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:51,250
<1-15,Ross>对我妹妹做那些奇怪性事
<1-15,Ross>weird sex stuff to my little sister.

23
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:54,650
<1-16,Rachel>你们听着  这是一件大事呢
<1-16,Rachel>And, I mean, you know, you guys, this is a big deal.

24
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,060
<1-16,Rachel>没有姑姑和姑父陪伴
<1-16,Rachel>How can we have her first birthday party

25
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,150
<1-16,Rachel>让她怎么度过她的一岁生日
<1-16,Rachel>without her aunt and her uncle?

26
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:01,380
<1-17,Monica>好的  我们会留下来
<1-17,Monica>All right, we'll stay.

27
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,990
<1-17,Monica>完事儿再开车过去
<1-17,Monica>We can just drive up after the party.

28
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:04,300
<1-18,Chandler>好吧  如果派对的事情
<1-18,Chandler>Fine. But if we end up

29
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,140
<1-18,Chandler>害我们没做杂志上的事情
<1-18,Chandler>not doing this Maxim thing because of this party--

30
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:08,980
<1-19,Monica>那不是不做的理由  好不好
<1-19,Monica>Believe me, that is not why we won't be doing that.

42
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:49,920
<2-1,Rachel>你知道吗  菲比
<2-1,Rachel>You know, Pheebs,

43
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,020
<2-1,Rachel>我小的时候过生日...
<2-1,Rachel>when I was little, on my birthday...

44
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,480
<2-1,Rachel>我爸会在家里
<2-1,Rachel>...my daddy would hide a present

45
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,180
<2-1,Rachel>每个房间藏礼物
<2-1,Rachel>in every room of the house.

46
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:57,110
<2-1,Rachel>然后会给我们"宝藏地图"
<2-1,Rachel>And then he would draw a treasure map

47
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:58,040
<2-1,Rachel>叫我们自己找
<2-1,Rachel>to help me find them all.

48
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:01,650
<2-2,Phoebe>我喜欢这种家庭习俗
<2-2,Phoebe>I love family traditions like that.

49
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,070
<2-2,Phoebe>我跟厄休拉小的时候
<2-2,Phoebe>When Ursula and I were kids,

50
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:05,170
<2-2,Phoebe>过生日
<2-2,Phoebe>on our birthday...

51
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:08,050
<2-2,Phoebe>我们的继父会去卖他的血
<2-2,Phoebe>...our stepdad would sell his blood

52
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:08,930
<2-2,Phoebe>来买吃的
<2-2,Phoebe>to buy us food.

53
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:13,470
<2-3,Ross>-嗨  大家  -嗨
<2-3,Ross>- Hey, guys. - Hi.

54
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,910
<2-4,Rachel and Phoebe>我带了摄像机  来录艾玛的派对
<2-4,Rachel and Phoebe>I brought the camera for Emma's video.

55
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:16,700
<2-5,Ross>喔  好呢
<2-5,Ross>Oh, good!

56
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,610
<2-6,Rachel>我们想要录艾玛的派对
<2-6,Rachel>We had this idea to make a birthday video for Emma...

57
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,100
<2-6,Rachel>当她十八岁时  再拿给他看
<2-6,Rachel>...and we'll give it to her when she's 18.

58
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,500
<2-7,Phoebe>酷
<2-7,Phoebe>Oh, cool.

59
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,940
<2-7,Phoebe>-就像一个"时空胶囊"  -是啊
<2-7,Phoebe>- Wow, it's like a time capsule. - Yeah.

60
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:28,740
<2-9,Phoebe>想象一下  到时她就会用一个现在还未发明的
<2-9,Phoebe>Oh, just think, she's gonna be watching that video on a TV...

61
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:31,450
<2-9,Phoebe>电视机来看这个影带
<2-9,Phoebe>...that hasn't even been invented yet...

62
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:35,140
<2-9,Phoebe>跟现在和她一样还是婴儿的朋友一起看
<2-9,Phoebe>...with friends who, right now, are just, like, babies.

63
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,860
<2-9,Phoebe>然后  他们住在一个浮起来的城市
<2-9,Phoebe>And they'll be living in a floating city that the humans built...

64
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,440
<2-9,Phoebe>为了逃避蚂蚁人
<2-9,Phoebe>...to escape the ant people.

65
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:45,340
<2-10,Ross>希望是如此
<2-10,Ross>That's the hope.

66
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,290
<2-10,Ross>所以  艾玛起来了吗
<2-10,Ross>So is Emma awake yet?

67
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:50,530
<2-11,Rachel>没有  现在午睡时间
<2-11,Rachel>No, it's still naptime.

68
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:51,780
<2-11,Rachel>不过  马上她就醒了
<2-11,Rachel>But she'll be up soon.

69
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:52,420
<2-12,Ross>乔伊在哪里呢
<2-12,Ross>Where's Joey?

70
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,300
<2-13,Rachel>我说过了  现在是午睡时间
<2-13,Rachel>I said, it's still naptime.

71
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,430
<2-14,Ross>-嗨  乔伊叔叔来了  -嘿
<2-14,Ross>- Hey, there's Uncle Joey. - Hey.

72
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,340
<2-16,Ross>说句话给十八岁生日的艾玛吧
<2-16,Ross>Hey, say something to Emma on her 18th birthday.

73
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,880
<2-18,Ross>-十八岁了  -乔伊  不要
<2-18,Ross>- Eighteen, huh? - Joey, no!

74
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:10,540
<2-19,Joey>怎么啦  怎么啦  是要给她很辣的朋友
<2-19,Joey>What? What? It's for her hot friends.

75
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:13,160
<2-20,Ross>当她们看到这个  你已经是五十二岁了
<2-20,Ross>When they see this, you'll be 52.

76
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:15,540
<2-21,Joey>就是我开始想稳定下来的时候呢
<2-21,Joey>And starting to think about settling down.

77
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,860
<2-22,Rachel>乔伊  帮我把这个支起来
<2-22,Rachel>Joey, will you please set this up for people

78
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,290
<2-22,Rachel>这样就可以放艾玛的礼物
<2-22,Rachel>to put Emma's presents on?

79
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:22,420
<2-23,Joey>非常愿意呢
<2-23,Joey>Love to. Yeah.

80
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,390
<2-24,Joey>我们要给她礼物吗
<2-24,Joey>We were supposed to bring presents?

81
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,420
<2-25,Phoebe>是啊  我写了一首歌给艾玛
<2-25,Phoebe>Yeah. I wrote Emma a song.

82
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,650
<2-26,Joey>我怎么会知道呢
<2-26,Joey>Oh, yeah. How was I supposed to know?

83
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:31,720
<2-27,Phoebe>这是一个生日派对啊
<2-27,Phoebe>Joey, it's a birthday party.

84
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,310
<2-28,Joey>是啊  但她仅一岁而已
<2-28,Joey>Yeah, but for a 1-year-old.

85
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,740
<2-28,Joey>有什么意义
<2-28,Joey>What's the point?

86
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:37,510
<2-28,Joey>那天她对着杯子大笑一个多小时
<2-28,Joey>The other day she laughed for an hour at a cup.

88
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:42,090
<2-28,Joey>只是一个普通杯子上面有阿母穿的像农夫的图案
<2-28,Joey>Just a cup with a picture of Elmo on it, dressed as a farmer.

89
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:46,840
<2-28,Joey>阿母站在牛旁边  牛说  "阿母..."
<2-28,Joey>And he's standing next to this cow, and the cow says, "El-moo."

90
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:54,990
<2-28,Joey>真是好笑的杯子
<2-28,Joey>Man, that's a funny cup.

<2-29,Monica>-嗨  -嗨

00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:04,720
<2-32,Chandler>当然  她昨晚知道要办一个派对
<2-32,Chandler>She was probably up all night excited about the party

95
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,610
<2-32,Chandler>肯定太兴奋了  睡不着
<2-32,Chandler>she knows is happening.

<2-33,Rachel>我知道你们很想去佛蒙特
<2-33,Rachel>I know you guys really want to get to Vermont,

97
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,530
<2-33,Rachel>对你们也是一件大事
<2-33,Rachel>and this isn't a big deal to you.

98
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,370
<2-33,Rachel>但这对我们也是一件大事  好吗
<2-33,Rachel>But it really is to us, okay?

99
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,550
<2-33,Rachel>艾玛不会再有第二次的一岁生日
<2-33,Rachel>Emma will never have a first birthday again.

100
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,020
<2-34,Monica>好的  你对  我们很抱歉
<2-34,Monica>You're right. We're sorry.

<2-34,Monica>and get the fun time started!

103
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:22,990
<2-35,Rachel>她昨晚睡不好所以我们不能叫醒她
<2-35,Rachel>She didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her.

104
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,130
<2-36,Monica>你是不是在跟我开玩笑啊  姓格林的
<2-36,Monica>Are you frigging kidding me, Greene?

106
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:33,200
<3-3,Monica>很高兴你们来了
<3-3,Monica>I'm so glad you came.

107
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,420
<3-4,Jack>真不敢相信  艾玛已经一岁了
<3-4,Jack>I can't believe Emma's already 1.

108
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:38,120
<3-5,Judy>我还记得你的一岁生日
<3-5,Judy>I remember your first birthday.

109
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:41,240
<3-5,Judy>罗斯很嫉妒我们把注意力都放在你身上
<3-5,Judy>Ross was jealous of all the attention we were giving you.

110
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:44,440
<3-5,Judy>他很用力地去拉他的蛋蛋
<3-5,Judy>He pulled on his testicles so hard...

111
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:47,420
<3-5,Judy>我们不得不要带他去看急诊
<3-5,Judy>...we had to take him to the emergency room.

112
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,470
<3-6,Ross>有些关于你爸爸的事情你还不知道
<3-6,Ross>There's something you didn't know about your dad.

<3-9,Joey>The three of us together again.

117
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,790
<3-9,Joey>你们怎样会更有趣吗
<3-9,Joey>You know what would be fun?

118
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,330
<3-9,Joey>就当做这礼物是我们三个人
<3-9,Joey>If we gave this present

119
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:08,780
<3-9,Joey>一起送给艾玛的
<3-9,Joey>to Emma from all of us.

120

<3-10,Jack>你是哪一位啊
<3-10,Jack>Which one are you?

121
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:19,970
<4-1,Monica>真不敢相信  艾玛还在睡
<4-1,Monica>I can't believe Emma's still asleep.

122
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,900
<4-2,Chandler>我知道  怎么办啊
<4-2,Chandler>I know. What are we gonna do?

123
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:25,390
<4-3,Monica>我有计划  一个好计划
<4-3,Monica>I've got a plan. I've got a plan.

124
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,390
<4-3,Monica>我会把这个盘子
<4-3,Monica>I'm going to ram this platter

125
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:30,170
<4-3,Monica>很用力的砸到你肋骨上
<4-3,Monica>really hard into your ribs.

126
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,270
<4-3,Monica>那你会痛的哇哇大叫
<4-3,Monica>You're gonna scream out,

127
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,380
<4-3,Monica>这样会吵醒她
<4-3,Monica>and that'll wake her up.

128
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,530
<4-4,Chandler>我不会和这种莫妮卡去佛蒙特的
<4-4,Chandler>I'm not going to Vermont with this Monica.

129
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:41,030
<4-5,Joey>嗨  菲比  你知道吗
<4-5,Joey>Hey, Pheebs? You know what?

130
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,100
<4-5,Joey>即然你写了歌给艾玛
<4-5,Joey>I was thinking since you wrote a song...

131
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:45,940
<4-5,Joey>那我也可以用我的才能给艾玛做些事
<4-5,Joey>...maybe I could do something for Emma using my talents.

132
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,450
<4-6,Phoebe>所以  你要去泡她
<4-6,Phoebe>So you're gonna hit on her?

133
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,380
<4-7,Joey>不是  不是啦  我的才能是表演啊
<4-7,Joey>No, no, no. My talents as an actor.

00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,850
<4-8,Phoebe>我可以  可以...
<4-8,Phoebe>You know, I could, like, maybe....

135
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:59,150
<4-9,Joey>给她边读本书边演出来
<4-9,Joey>I could do a dramatic reading of one of her books.

136
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:02,070
<4-10,Phoebe>或是  你可以把一个叉子叉在苹果上
<4-10,Phoebe>Or you could stick a fork in an apple.

137
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,780
<4-11,Joey>我想艾玛会喜欢的
<4-11,Joey>Hey, I think Emma might like it.

138
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,110
<4-12,Rachel>艾玛会喜欢什么
<4-12,Rachel>Oh, Emma might like what?

139
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,980
<4-14,Rachel>-我的礼物  -你要给他什么
<4-14,Rachel>- My present. - What did you get her?

140
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,960

143
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:16,760
<4-17,Joey>听起来好好玩了
<4-17,Joey>That sounds like fun.

144
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:19,670
<4-18,Rachel>你知道吗  因为大家很不耐烦
<4-18,Rachel>People are getting a little antsy

145
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,640
<4-18,Rachel>要等艾玛起来
<4-18,Rachel>waiting for Emma to wake up from her nap.

146
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:23,980
<4-18,Rachel>所以  你们可以现在表演一个吗
<4-18,Rachel>So would you mind performing them once now?

152
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:37,580
<4-23,Phoebe>上去没东西演
<4-23,Phoebe>having nothing prepared?

<4-32,Rachel>我准备了一首歌给艾玛
<4-32,Rachel>I prepared a song for Emma,

187
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:23,610
<4-33,Phoebe>这首歌让我俩的心相连

00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:27,820
<4-33,Phoebe>没有比音乐更好的礼物了

190
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:38,780
<4-33,Phoebe>和你名字押韵的字极少
<4-33,Phoebe>'Cause not much else rhymes with "Emma"

191
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:40,930
<4-33,Phoebe>也许仅有演员理查德·克里纳
<4-33,Phoebe>Maybe the actor Richard Crenna

<5-2,Jack>如果从现在算起  还有十七年之久呢
<5-2,Jack>Right now, that seems so far away, 17 years.

00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,960
<5-3,Judy>到时候你已经长大了
<5-3,Judy>Yes. You'll be all grown up by then,

202
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,550
<5-3,Judy>而到时候我们...

00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:25,860
<5-3,Judy>你爷爷和我可能都不在了
<5-3,Judy>Well, your grandfather and l might not be here.

204
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:28,470
<5-4,Jack>没错  这信息可能是从阴间
<5-4,Jack>That's true. This message could be coming to you...

205
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,380
<5-4,Jack>传给你的  艾玛
<5-4,Jack>...from beyond the grave, Emma.

206
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,270
<5-5,Judy>毕竟我父母亲很年轻就过世了
<5-5,Judy>After all, my parents died very young.

207
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,020
<5-6,Jack>我的胆固醇还过高呢

209
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:42,420
<5-7,Judy>女生也会死于心脏病

<5-11,Monica>他们有全世界最好吃的奶油
<5-11,Monica>Oh, my God, that place has the creamiest frosting!

218
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:03,380
<5-11,Monica>我小时候喜欢搭便车去那里
<5-11,Monica>I used to hitchhike there when I was a kid.

219
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,180
<5-12,Rachel>无论如何
<5-12,Rachel>Well, anyway,

220
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:09,460
<5-12,Rachel>他们可以做很多新颖的蛋糕

221
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,720
<5-12,Rachel>也很多种造型
<5-12,Rachel>...in all different shapes.

222
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:12,510
<5-12,Rachel>如果你自己准备照片
<5-12,Rachel>And if you give them a photo,

223
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:13,940
<5-12,Rachel>他们还会放到蛋糕上
<5-12,Rachel>they'll copy it in icing.

224
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:16,250
<5-13,Monica>那你一定放艾玛的照片喽
<5-13,Monica>Did you do a picture of Emma?

225
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,460
<5-14,Rachel>当然  在一个兔子形的蛋糕
<5-14,Rachel>Yes. On a cake shaped like a bunny.

226

227
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,500
<5-15,Ross>这家店是不是刚好
<5-15,Ross>Does this bakery by any chance also bake...

228
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:23,900
<5-15,Ross>也卖色情蛋糕
<5-15,Ross>...erotic cakes?

229
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,340
<5-15,Ross>或许给单身派对使用
<5-15,Ross>Say, for bachelorette parties?

230
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:31,150
<5-16,Rachel>你在讲什么啊  喔  我的天啊
<5-16,Rachel>Ross, what are you talking--? Oh, my God!

231
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,340
<5-16,Rachel>他们还把我女儿的脸放在"小弟弟"上
<5-16,Rachel>They put my baby's face on a penis!

232
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:39,200
<5-16,Rachel>这才像派对嘛
<5-16,Rachel>Now it's a party!

233
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:42,420
<5-17,Rachel>这一点都不好笑
<5-17,Rachel>Wait, you guys, this isn't funny.

234
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:44,660
<5-17,Rachel>如果我想让这蛋糕成为一场灾难
<5-17,Rachel>If I wanted this cake to be a disaster,

235
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,620
<5-17,Rachel>我可以自己做啊
<5-17,Rachel>I would have baked it myself!

236
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,290
<5-17,Rachel>我还是觉得它很好吃啊
<5-17,Rachel>Is it okay

237
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:50,160
<5-18,Jack>这样没问题吧
<5-18,Jack>that I still think it looks delicious?

238
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:55,100
<5-18,Jack>杰克  你看看
<5-18,Jack>Jack, look at this.

239
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,040
<5-18,Jack>我知道你在想什么
<5-18,Jack>I know what you're thinking, Judy.

240
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,560
<5-18,Jack>其相似程度非常惊人
<5-18,Jack>The resemblance is uncanny.

241
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:06,540
<5-19,Ross>我也差点再度拉我的蛋蛋
<5-19,Ross>I am this close to tugging on my testicles again.

242
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,700
<5-20,Ross>不  不是  这不是我要订的
<5-20,Ross>No, no, this is not what I ordered, okay?

243
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,410
<5-21,Rachel>我特地去新泽西
<5-21,Rachel>I went all the way to New Jersey

244
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:15,520
<5-22,Joey>只为了我女儿有完美的生日蛋糕
<5-22,Joey>so that I could have the perfect cake...

245
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:19,660
<5-23,Rachel>还有  我需要兔子蛋糕  现在
<5-23,Rachel>...for my daughter's birthday. And I need a bunny cake right now!

246
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,210
<5-20,Ross>如果要快点的话
<5-20,Ross>Ask them if it would be faster

247
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,690
<5-20,Ross>我们可以从"小弟弟"上取出孩子的照片
<5-20,Ross>if we cut the baby's face off the penis...

248
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,860
<5-20,Ross>再贴到兔子蛋糕上
<5-20,Ross>...so we could put it on the bunny.

<6-7,Rachel>大家也都走了
<6-7,Rachel>Everybody left.

421
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:31,040
<6-7,Rachel>还加上这个烂蛋糕
<6-7,Rachel>We still have this stupid obscene cake.

422
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:32,820
<6-8,Ross>也许我可以弄好这蛋糕
<6-8,Ross>Hey, maybe I can fix that.

<6-8,Ross>试试看  改成别的形状嘛

<6-8,Ross>已经无所谓了
<6-8,Ross>Oh, don't even bother.

425
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,960
<6-9,Rachel>我们已经毁了她的第一个生日

428
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:44,400
<6-9,Rachel>罗斯  非常重要
<6-9,Rachel>Ross? Very!

429
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:47,290
<6-9,Rachel>你给我的那本书背面是这么说的
<6-9,Rachel>According to the back cover of that book that you gave me.

430
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:51,100
<6-10,Ross>瑞秋  她不会记得这些
<6-10,Ross>Rach, she's not gonna remember this.

431
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:54,300
<6-11,Rachel>也许吧
<6-11,Rachel>I guess.

432
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,410
<6-11,Rachel>我本来想像着
<6-11,Rachel>Oh, I just had such an idea

433
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:00,490
<6-11,Rachel>今天会是怎样的一天
<6-11,Rachel>of what this day would be like, you know?

<6-11,Rachel>Emma laughing...

435
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,580
<6-11,Rachel>大家围绕着蛋糕
<6-11,Rachel>...and everybody gathered around her cake,

436
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,580
<6-11,Rachel>唱"生日快乐"
<6-11,Rachel>singing "Happy Birthday."

437
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:08,980
<6-11,Rachel>然后我们...
<6-11,Rachel>And then we would all--

438
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:11,280
<6-11,Rachel>嘿  不要挡老娘的路
<6-11,Rachel>Hey, get out of the road,

<6-15,Rachel>天啊  你把它变成小兔子了
<6-15,Rachel>Oh, my God. Look, you made it into a bunny.

00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:26,960
<6-15,Rachel>你怎么弄的
<6-15,Rachel>How did you do that?

445
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:30,350
<6-16,Ross>我把这俩东西改成脸颊
<6-16,Ross>Well, I just made these two things cheeks.

446
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:35,300
<6-16,Ross>把这东西分成两份  变成耳朵
<6-16,Ross>And then I split this to make ears.

447
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,470
<6-17,Rachel>我非常感动呢
<6-17,Rachel>Well, I am very impressed.

<6-18,Ross>我显然的可以
<6-18,Ross>I, apparently, can turn phallic cakes

00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,100
<6-18,Ross>把"小弟弟"改成兔子蛋糕
<6-18,Ross>into woodland creatures.

451
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:49,700
<7-1,Monica>还有另外一种方法来整理玩具
<7-1,Monica>Now, another way to organize your stuffed animals
