<2-11,Phoebe>莫妮卡  那么问是不对的

00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:40,680
<2-11,Phoebe>从你们在哪里做开始说吧
<2-11,Phoebe>Start with where.

52
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,930
<2-12,Rachel>事情发生在六个星期前
<2-12,Rachel>It happened about six weeks ago.

53
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:50,670
<2-12,Rachel>我回到家  发现罗斯也在
<2-12,Rachel>I just got home from work and Ross was already there.

54
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,400
<2-12,Rachel>他跟乔伊在一起玩
<2-12,Rachel>Guess he'd been hanging out with Joey.

55
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,020
<2-13,Joey>别客气  兄弟
<2-13,Joey>You're welcome, buddy.

57
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,870
<2-15,Rachel>我有很多事要做  罗斯很好心
<2-15,Rachel>I had a lot of work to do, and Ross, nice guy that he is,

58
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,200
<2-15,Rachel>主动说要帮忙
<2-15,Rachel>offered to help me out.

59
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,850
<2-15,Rachel>我们边喝酒边聊天
<2-15,Rachel>And then we had a little wine, we got to talking.

60
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:12,060
<2-15,Rachel>接下来罗斯突然就对我采取了主动
<2-15,Rachel>And next thing you know, out of nowhere, Ross comes on to me.

61
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,110
<2-16,Ross>这很容易让人误会
<2-16,Ross>That's a little misleading.

62
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,080
<2-18,Ross>-什么  -你刚刚说的谎话
<2-18,Ross>- What is? - The lie you just told.

63
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:24,510
<2-19,Rachel>-我说是你主动的  -没错
<2-19,Rachel>- That you came on to me? - There's the one!

64
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:27,230
<2-20,Ross>但那是真的  老实一点吧
<2-20,Ross>But you did. Let's be honest.

65
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:28,690
<2-21,Rachel>没错  老实一点吧
<2-21,Rachel>Yes, let's.

66
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:33,870
<2-22,Ross>那不重要
<2-22,Ross>It's not important.

67
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,150
<2-22,Ross>重要的是我们要生孩子了
<2-22,Ross>What's important is, we're having a baby,

68
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:39,040
<2-22,Ross>谁先泡"随"并不重要
<2-22,Ross>and it doesn't matter who came on to who.

69
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,350
<2-23,Joey>是"谁"才对
<2-23,Joey>"Whom."

70
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:45,140
<2-23,Joey>没错
<2-23,Joey>That's right.

71
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,370
<2-24,Rachel>你先吻我的
<2-24,Rachel>You know you kissed me first.

72
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:50,660
<2-25,Ross>什么  是你求我吻你的
<2-25,Ross>What? You were begging to kiss you!

73
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:53,370
<2-25,Ross>你处处给我发送暗号
<2-25,Ross>You were sending me signals all over the place!

74
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:55,390
<2-26,Rachel>-我向你发暗号  -对
<2-26,Rachel>- I was sending signals? - Yeah.

75
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:57,160
<2-28,Rachel>谁觉得是我向罗斯
<2-28,Rachel>Please. Okay. Anyone in this room think

76
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,260
<2-28,Rachel>发送乞求暗号的
<2-28,Rachel>that I'd actually send Ross begging signals?

77
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,910
<2-28,Rachel>请举手
<2-28,Rachel>Please, show of hands.

78
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,570
<2-29,Ross>别人怎么想并不重要
<2-29,Ross>You know, it doesn't matter what people believe!

79
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:08,190
<2-29,Ross>重要的是发生了什么
<2-29,Ross>What matters is what happened.

80
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:10,440
<2-30,Rachel>罗斯  跟我解释一下暗号的事
<2-30,Rachel>Okay, so these signals, Ross, explain this to me,

81
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,830
<2-30,Rachel>或许我得小心一点
<2-30,Rachel>'cause maybe I need to be more careful.

82
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:14,110
<2-30,Rachel>我正在发送讯号吗
<2-30,Rachel>Am I sending these signals right now?

83
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,620
<2-31,Ross>你知道吗  瑞秋  别纠结这个问题了
<2-31,Ross>You know what? You know what? Rachel, just drop it.

84
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,830
<2-32,Rachel>拜托告诉我  我是怎么求你的
<2-32,Rachel>No, please. Show me how I begged you.

85
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:21,470
<2-33,Ross>我可以证明  我都录在录影带里了
<2-33,Ross>I can show you! I have it on videotape.

86
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,300
<2-33,Ross>那不过是一种表达方法
<2-33,Ross>It's an expression.

87
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:40,050
<3-1,Phoebe>我不敢相信他录下他们做爱的经过
<3-1,Phoebe>I can't believe he taped the two of them having sex.

88
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,180
<3-2,Joey>对  你录之前要先告诉对方才行
<3-2,Joey>Yeah. You gotta tell a girl before you tape her.

89
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:47,110
<3-2,Joey>那是菜鸟才会犯的错误
<3-2,Joey>Such a rookie mistake.

90
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,920
<3-3,Chandler>你知道谁家有很棒的摄影机吗
<3-3,Chandler>You know who has a great camera?

91
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,400
<3-4,Phoebe>葛瑞格跟珍妮
<3-4,Phoebe>Greg and Jenny?

92
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,650
<3-5,Monica>你还想打电话给他们吗

<3-6,Chandler>-我想打给他们  -快打吧
<3-6,Chandler>- I want to call them. - Let's call them.

<3-7,Joey>问他们有没有买纪念品送给朋友
<3-7,Joey>Ask them if they brought their friends souvenirs.

<3-9,Joey>快挂掉  光跟他们说话你就会食物中毒
<3-9,Joey>Hang up. You get food poisoning just talking to that place.

100
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,930
<3-14,Monica>我觉得这个电话号码是错的
<3-14,Monica>I don't think this number's right.

101
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,580
<3-16,Phoebe>-怎么  -你们拿到假电话了
<3-16,Phoebe>- What? - You got fake-numbered.

<3-17,Monica>-什么  没有人会那么做  -我们会
<3-17,Monica>- What? People don't do that. - Oh, I think we do.

103
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,320
<3-19,Monica>他们给了我们假号码
<3-19,Monica>They gave us a fake number?

104

<3-19,Monica>-他们为什么要那么做  -我不知道
<3-19,Monica>- Why would they do that? - I don't know.

<3-20,Chandler>跟你聊天很开心
<3-20,Chandler>You were a delight to talk to.

106
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,660
<3-20,Chandler>你问了一些很有见解的问题
<3-20,Chandler>You asked all those insightful, great questions.

107

<3-21,Monica>你也很风趣  一直在开玩笑
<3-21,Monica>And you've never been funnier. I mean, joke, joke, joke!

108
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,060
<3-21,Monica>你真的很耍宝
<3-21,Monica>You were a hoot!

<3-22,Joey>别担心了  你们还有我跟菲比
<3-22,Joey>Don't worry about it. You still got me and Phoebe.

110
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,360
<3-23,Phoebe>对不起  我不要葛瑞格跟珍妮的退货
<3-23,Phoebe>Excuse me, I don't want Greg and Jenny's rejects.

111
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,770
<3-24,Ross>瑞秋不肯跟我说话  她连门都不肯开
<3-24,Ross>Rachel won't talk to me. She won't open the door.

112
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:04,880
<3-25,Phoebe>我很好奇是为什么  变态
<3-25,Phoebe>I wonder why, pervert.

113
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,770
<3-26,Ross>好吧  我不是变态
<3-26,Ross>Okay, listen, I am not a pervert.

114
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:09,940
<3-27,Phoebe>变态都是那么说的
<3-27,Phoebe>That's, like, the pervert motto.

115
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,540
<3-27,Phoebe>举起你的右手  把左手插进裤子里
<3-27,Phoebe>Raise your right hand, put your left hand down your pants

116
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,240
<3-27,Phoebe>再重复那句话
<3-27,Phoebe>and repeat that.

117
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:20,410
<3-28,Ross>我不是故意要拍瑞秋
<3-28,Ross>Filming Rachel was not something I planned.

118
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:23,880
<3-28,Ross>事情的经过是这样的  乔伊可以帮我作证
<3-28,Ross>Okay, look. Here's what happened. Joey can back me up on this.

119
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,850
<3-28,Ross>还记得一个半月前  我跑去问你一个问题吗
<3-28,Ross>A month and a half ago, remember I came to you with a problem?

120
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:31,170
<3-29,Joey>我的私人问题

<3-29,Joey>-什么私人间题  -关于性的问题
<3-29,Joey>- What personal thing? - About sex?

122
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:41,240
<3-30,Ross>我好几个月没有性生活了
<3-30,Ross>That I hadn't had sex in months?

123
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,670
<3-31,Joey>我刚才就知道你的是哪件事
<3-31,Joey>Yeah, I knew what you were talking about.

125
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,240
<4-2,Joey>你有空吗
<4-2,Joey>Do you have a minute?

126
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,250
<4-3,Ross>我想谈一件我很难启齿的事
<4-3,Ross>I'd like to talk about something I'm uncomfortable talking about.

127
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,390
<4-3,Ross>没问题
<4-3,Ross>Sure.

128
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:06,020
<4-4,Joey>你跟你妈一起洗澡如何
<4-4,Joey>How about you showering with your mom?

129
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,590
<4-5,Ross>我已经想好问题了
<4-5,Ross>I actually had a topic in mind.

130
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,820
<4-5,Ross>我进入了干涸期
<4-5,Ross>I'm kind of going through a dry spell,

131
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:20,960
<4-5,Ross>在性生活方面
<4-5,Ross>sex-wise.

132
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:23,620
<4-6,Joey>-有好几个月了吗  -五个月...
<4-6,Joey>- For, like, months? - Five, to be...

133
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,490
<4-7,Ross>骗人的  是六个月
<4-7,Ross>...lying. Six.

134
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,220
<4-8,Joey>六个月  那一定很难熬
<4-8,Joey>Six months? That's rough.

135
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,130
<4-9,Ross>没有那么糟糕
<4-9,Ross>It's not all bad.

136
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:34,170
<4-9,Ross>我学着去欣赏生活中的一些小事  譬如说
<4-9,Ross>I'm learning to appreciate the small things in life, like...

137
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:38,810
<4-9,Ross>鸟的叫声跟天空的颜色
<4-9,Ross>...the sound of a bird and the color of the sky.

138
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:41,580
<4-10,Joey>天空是蓝色的  罗斯  我昨天才做过爱
<4-10,Joey>The sky's blue, Ross. And I had sex yesterday.

139
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:47,770
<4-11,Ross>拜托  帮帮我  我今晚有约会
<4-11,Ross>Please help me. I have a date tonight.

140
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:50,640
<4-11,Ross>我得顺利达阵  我很担心自己的健康
<4-11,Ross>It has to go well. I'm scared for my health.

141
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,240
<4-11,Ross>好的  好的
<4-11,Ross>Okay, okay.

142
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:56,350
<4-12,Joey>我有个点子  我想出一个故事
<4-12,Joey>I got something. It's this story that I came up with.

143
00:07:56,350 --> 00:08:00,320
<4-12,Joey>非常浪漫  听到这个故事的女人都会心动
<4-12,Joey>Very romantic. I swear any woman that hears it is putty.

144
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,010
<4-13,Ross>-真的吗  说吧  -好
<4-13,Ross>- Really? Tell it to me. - Okay.

145
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:06,170
<4-14,Joey>你听完后定会想跟我上床
<4-14,Joey>Now, you're gonna want to have sex with me when you hear it.

146
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,040
<4-14,Joey>记住  那只是一个故事
<4-14,Joey>Remember, it is just the story.

147
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,350
<4-15,Ross>我会试着控制自己
<4-15,Ross>I'll try to control myself.

148
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,060
<4-15,Ross>好
<4-15,Ross>Okay.

149
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:21,480
<4-16,Joey>多年前  我在西欧自助旅行
<4-16,Joey>Years ago, I was backpacking across Western Europe...

150
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,980
<4-17,Ross>你在西欧自助旅行
<4-17,Ross>You were backpacking across Western Europe?

151
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,610
<4-18,Joey>你再干涸六个月去吧  罗斯
<4-18,Joey>Have a nice six more months, Ross.

152
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:29,190
<4-19,Ross>好吧  抱歉  求求你
<4-19,Ross>Okay, okay. I'm sorry. Please, please.

153
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:31,810
<4-19,Ross>你去了西欧  然后
<4-19,Ross>You were in Western Europe, and...?

154
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,430
<4-19,Ross>我在巴塞罗那郊外
<4-19,Ross>I was just outside Barcelona,

155
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:39,920
<4-20,Joey>在第比达包山脚下健行
<4-20,Joey>hiking in the foothills of Mount Tibidabo.

156
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:44,480
<4-20,Joey>我走到小路的尽头
<4-20,Joey>I was at the end of this path,

157
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,400
<4-20,Joey>来到一片林中空地  发现了一座湖
<4-20,Joey>and I came to a clearing and there was a lake.

158
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,740
<4-20,Joey>它非常隐密  四周都是高大的树木
<4-20,Joey>Very secluded. There were tall trees all around.

159
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,160
<4-20,Joey>那里非常安静  美极了
<4-20,Joey>It was dead silent. Gorgeous.

160
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:57,470
<4-20,Joey>我看到在湖的对面
<4-20,Joey>And across the lake I saw

161
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:01,270
<4-20,Joey>有个美女在洗澡
<4-20,Joey>a beautiful  woman bathing herself.

162
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,570
<4-20,Joey>但她在哭
<4-20,Joey>But she was crying.

163
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,630
<4-21,Ross>为什么
<4-21,Ross>Why?

164
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:17,210
<5-1,Kristen>酒真的很棒
<5-1,Kristen>This is great wine.

165
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:19,090
<5-2,Ross>是法国酒
<5-2,Ross>It's from France.

166
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,690
<5-2,Ross>法国在欧洲
<5-2,Ross>In Europe.

167
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:25,500
<5-2,Ross>就在西欧
<5-2,Ross>Western Europe.

168
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,270
<5-2,Ross>几年前
<5-2,Ross>You know, a few years ago

169
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:34,590
<5-3,Kristen>我在西欧自助旅行
<5-3,Kristen>I was backpacking across Western Europe.

170
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:37,280
<5-4,Ross>-真的吗  -等一下  后面的故事更精彩
<5-4,Ross>- Really? - Wait, it gets better.

171
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:43,380
<5-4,Ross>对  我在巴塞罗那
<5-4,Ross>Yeah, I was in Barcelona.

172
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:46,000
<5-5,Kristen>我在巴塞罗那念过一年书
<5-5,Kristen>I studied for a year in Barcelona.

173
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:51,890
<5-6,Ross>总之我在健行...
<5-6,Ross>So anyway, I was hiking...

174
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:54,110
<5-7,Kristen>-我喜欢健行  -那真的太棒了
<5-7,Kristen>- I love hiking! - That's great!

175
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,390
<5-8,Ross>我在第比达亚波山脚下健行...
<5-8,Ross>I was hiking along the foothills of Mount Tibidaybo...

176
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:02,360
<5-9,Kristen>我想是"第比达包山"才对
<5-9,Kristen>I think it's "Tibidabo."

177
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:04,830
<5-10,Ross>你想来讲这个故事吗
<5-10,Ross>Okay, do you want to tell the story?

178
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:11,730
<6-1,Joey>你怎么来了  约会还顺利吗
<6-1,Joey>What are you doing here? How'd your date go?

179
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:14,820
<6-2,Ross>太棒了 我正要过街去和她做爱
<6-2,Ross>Great. I'm across the street having sex right now.

180
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,560
<6-2,Ross>你的故事烂透了
<6-2,Ross>Your story sucks.

181
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,680
<6-3,Joey>如果不起作用  一定是你说的方法不对
<6-3,Joey>Look, if it didn't work, it's because you didn't tell it right.

182
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:25,070
<6-3,Joey>-告诉我你是怎么说的  -不  我不想谈
<6-3,Joey>- Show me how you did it. - No, I don't want to.

183
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,510
<6-5,Joey>你上次看到裸女是什么时候的事
<6-5,Joey>How long since you seen a girl naked?

184
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:30,800
<6-6,Ross>我在西欧自助旅行
<6-6,Ross>I was backpacking across Western Europe...

185
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,400
<6-7,Joey>我没有感觉
<6-7,Joey>I'm not feeling it.

186
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,760
<6-8,Ross>我在巴塞罗那郊外健行
<6-8,Ross>I was outside Barcelona, hiking...

187
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,270
<6-9,Joey>罗斯  我并没觉得欲火焚身  你呢
<6-9,Joey>No, Ross, I'm not hot. Are you hot?

188
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:41,320
<6-10,Ross>我六个月没做爱  每天都欲火焚身
<6-10,Ross>It's been six months. I'm always hot.

189
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,070
<6-11,Joey>你讲故事不够动人  你根本就不相信它
<6-11,Joey>You're not selling the story. You don't believe it.

190
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:49,480
<6-11,Joey>我得走了  我有约会  但试试这招
<6-11,Joey>I gotta go, I got a date. But try this.

191
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,710
<6-11,Joey>学我在试镜前做的那一招
<6-11,Joey>Do what I do when I'm preparing for an audition.

192
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:54,410
<6-11,Joey>不  我帮你设置好录像机
<6-11,Joey>No. I'll set you up with my video camera

193
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:57,380
<6-11,Joey>你可以自拍看看哪里做错了
<6-11,Joey>and you could record yourself and see what you're doing wrong.

194
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,800
<6-12,Ross>我会试试看
<6-12,Ross>I'll try that.

195
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:03,250
<6-13,Joey>已经设定好了  可以拍了
<6-13,Joey>Alright, now, you're all set up. You're good to go.

196
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,750
<6-13,Joey>-按下录影键就可以了  祝你好运 -谢谢
<6-13,Joey>- Just hit record. - Good luck. Thanks.

197
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:09,580
<6-17,Joey>乔伊  如果你跟女人约会出了问题
<6-17,Joey>Hey, Jo, listen. If you ever have any problem with the ladies,

198
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:11,320
<6-18,Ross>我可以帮你
<6-18,Ross>you know I'll help you out.

199
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,700
<6-19,Joey>那对我来说意义重大
<6-19,Joey>That means a lot to me, man.

200
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:36,560
<6-19,Joey>你好啊
<6-19,Joey>Hello.

201
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:41,060
<6-20,Ross>需要我帮你效劳吗  要擦镜头吗
<6-20,Ross>Can I get you anything? Lens cleaner?

202
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,350
<6-20,Ross>电池还有电吗
<6-20,Ross>Your battery okay?

203
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,900
<6-23,Rachel>罗斯  谢天谢地你在这里  快帮帮我
<6-23,Rachel>Ross, thank God you're here. You have to help me.

204
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:50,720
<6-23,Rachel>你在自言自语吗
<6-23,Rachel>Were you talking to yourself?

205
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,100
<6-24,Ross>那样说会比较不丢脸  对  没错
<6-24,Ross>That's less embarrassing. Yes. Yes, I was.

206
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,840
<6-25,Ross>她一走进来  我一分心
<6-25,Ross>So when she came in, I got distracted

207
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,880
<6-25,Ross>就完全忘记了录影机的事
<6-25,Ross>and totally forgot about the camera.

208
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,770
<6-25,Ross>录影机拍录下了整个经过
<6-25,Ross>It kept rolling and recorded everything.

209
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:07,670
<6-26,Chandler>我们得看看那卷录影带
<6-26,Chandler>Yeah, we're gonna need to see that tape.

210
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:13,190
<6-28,Ross>真是个好主意  那会让瑞秋原谅我
<6-28,Ross>What a great idea! That'll get Rachel to forgive me.

211
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:16,960
<6-29,Joey>那对她来说不公平  忘了录影带的事吧
<6-29,Joey>You know what? It's not fair to her. Let's forget the tape.

212
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,020
<6-30,Ross>谢谢
<6-30,Ross>Thank you.

213
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:24,290
<9-30,Ross>-不行  -你说得对
<9-30,Ross>- No. - You're right.

214
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:29,490
<9-30,Ross>-乔伊  不行  -我了解
<9-30,Ross>- Joey, no. - Loud and clear.

215
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,790
<7-1,Monica>我不明白为什么葛瑞格和珍妮
<7-1,Monica>I still don't get why Greg and Jenny

216
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:40,470
<7-1,Monica>要给我们假的电话号码
<7-1,Monica>would give us a fake number.

217
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,810
<7-2,Joey>如果他们是这方面的老手
<7-2,Joey>You know, if they knew what they were doing,

218
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:45,010
<7-2,Joey>甚至都不会给你们真名
<7-2,Joey>they probably didn't give you real names, either.

219
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,460
<7-3,Monica>或许有人会给假电话号码
<7-3,Monica>Maybe people give out fake numbers,

220
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,720
<7-3,Monica>但没有人会给假名
<7-3,Monica>but they don't give out fake names.

221
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:54,580
<7-4,Joey>是吗  嗨  肯·亚当斯很高兴能认识你
<7-4,Joey>Oh, yeah? Hi. Ken Adams. Nice to meet you.

222
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:58,150
<7-5,Phoebe>瑞吉娜·费兰吉
<7-5,Phoebe>Regina Phalange.

223
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,850
<7-6,Chandler>-真不懂  我们没做错事  -就是嘛
<7-6,Chandler>- I just don't get it. We didn't do anything wrong. - I know.

224
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,030
<7-7,Monica>虽然你说了很多冷笑话
<7-7,Monica>Although you did tell an awful lot of jokes.

225
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:12,980
<7-8,Chandler>你说很好笑啊  快讲笑话吧
<7-8,Chandler>You said they were funny. Joke, joke, joke!

226
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:15,790
<7-9,Monica>讲笑话...
<7-9,Monica>Joke, joke...

227
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,660
<7-10,Chandler>可能是你问了太多问题害的
<7-10,Chandler>Or maybe it was your questions.

228
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,890
<7-11,Monica>我的问题怎么了
<7-11,Monica>What about my questions?

229
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:25,210
<7-12,Chandler>你问了太多问题
<7-12,Chandler>The sheer volume.

230
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:27,690
<7-12,Chandler>像是跟谜题王坐在一起
<7-12,Chandler>It was like flying with the Riddler.

231
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:34,300
<7-14,Chandler>-你又在讲笑话吗  -你又在问问题吗
<7-14,Chandler>- I'm soory. Was that another joke? - Was that another question?

232
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:38,170
<7-15,Rachel>罗斯还在吗
<7-15,Rachel>Is Ross still here?

233
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:41,630
<7-16,Joey>他走了  但他告诉我们发生了什么事
<7-16,Joey>No, Rach, he's gone, but, listen, he told us what happened.

234
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,900
<7-16,Joey>听起来真的是个误会
<7-16,Joey>It does sound like an honest mistake.

235
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,610
<7-17,Rachel>是吗  如果我把我跟你做爱的过程录下来
<7-17,Rachel>Really? How would you like it if I had sex with you

236
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:48,330
<7-17,Rachel>你会有什么感觉呢
<7-17,Rachel>and I taped it?

237
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,220
<7-17,Rachel>算了吧
<7-17,Rachel>Oh, forget it.

238
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:55,110
<7-17,Rachel>他来了  我孩子他爹
<7-17,Rachel>There he is, the father of my child,

239
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,780
<7-17,Rachel>西村的黄片之王
<7-17,Rachel>the porn king of the West Village.

240
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:01,460
<7-17,Rachel>那是个意外  行吗
<7-17,Rachel>Look, it was an accident, okay?

241
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:04,940
<7-18,Ross>我觉得很内疚  我发誓我还没有看过它
<7-18,Ross>I feel bad that happened, but I swear, I didn't even watch it.

242
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:07,520
<7-18,Ross>总之  拿去吧
<7-18,Ross>Anyway, here.

243
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:11,200
<7-18,Ross>或许亲手毁了它  你会觉得舒服一点
<7-18,Ross>I thought you might be more comfortable destroying it yourself.

244
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:13,300
<7-18,Ross>谢谢
<7-18,Ross>Thank you.

245
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,540
<7-19,Rachel>什么
<7-19,Rachel>What?

246
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:28,100
<7-19,Rachel>-你们不想看这玩意吧  -我们当然想
<7-19,Rachel>- You don't want to see this, do you? - Hell, yeah!

247
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:32,500
<7-21,Rachel>我不会让你们看这个
<7-21,Rachel>I am not gonna show you this.

248
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,010
<7-22,Phoebe>我们不是要看性爱镜头
<7-22,Phoebe>Not the sex part.

249
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:36,020
<7-22,Phoebe>只是想看你们怎么开始的
<7-22,Phoebe>Just the stuff leading up to it.

250
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,970
<7-23,Ross>算了  让她毁掉吧
<7-23,Ross>Forget it. She's destroying it.

251
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:42,340
<7-24,Phoebe>我们会想其他办法
<7-24,Phoebe>Okay, fine, fine. We'll think of another way

252
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:45,010
<7-24,Phoebe>解决"谁先主动"的问题
<7-24,Phoebe>to put the "who came on to who" thing to rest.

253
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:46,870
<7-24,Phoebe>快想
<7-24,Phoebe>Come on now, think!

254
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:50,820
<7-25,Ross>别想这事了  菲比  那是瑞秋的录影带
<7-25,Ross>Forget it, Phoebe, okay? It's Rachel's tape,

255
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:52,950
<7-25,Ross>她想怎么处置它是她的自由
<7-25,Ross>and she can do whatever she wants with it.

256
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:56,680
<7-25,Ross>她想毁了它  别说了
<7-25,Ross>And she wants to destroy it, so end of story.

257
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:01,770
<7-27,Ross>-我想看  -什么
<7-27,Ross>- I want to see it. - What?

258
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:04,360
<7-28,Rachel>你显然不希望大家看这盘录影带
<7-28,Rachel>Clearly, you don't want people to see this tape.

259
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,410
<7-28,Rachel>我也不想让大家看
<7-28,Rachel>I don't want people to see this tape, either.

260
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:08,440
<7-28,Rachel>但你非常不希望我们看
<7-28,Rachel>But you so badly don't want us to see it

261
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,720
<7-28,Rachel>让我想要看个究竞  明白吗
<7-28,Rachel>that it makes me want to see it. Do you see?

262
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:14,950
<7-29,Joey>我们到底要不要看录影带
<7-29,Joey>Are we watching the tape or not?

263
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,970
<7-30,Ross>我不让别人看是为了保护你
<7-30,Ross>I don't want people to see it for your sake.

264
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:20,880
<7-31,Rachel>我不相信你
<7-31,Rachel>I don't believe you.

265
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:24,880
<7-31,Rachel>我想你不希望他们看到你求我
<7-31,Rachel>I think you don't want them to see you begging me.

266
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:30,390
<7-33,Rachel>-瑞秋  求你了  -这算是预告部份
<7-33,Rachel>- Rachel, please? - Oh, a little preview.

267
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:36,170
<7-34,Ross>好吧  我要这卷录影带证明
<7-34,Ross>Fine. Fine. But I want the record to show

268
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:38,440
<7-34,Ross>我是想保护你
<7-34,Ross>that I tried to take the high road.

269
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:41,530
<7-34,Ross>因为再过五分钟我会说...
<7-34,Ross>Because in about five minutes, I'm gonna be saying...

270
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,790
<7-35,Rachel>好吧  要开始了
<7-35,Rachel>Okay, here we go.

271
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:54,880
<7-36,Ross>你好啊  需要我帮你效劳吗
<7-36,Ross>Hello. Can I get you anything?

272
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,220
<7-37,Joey>我好开心
<7-37,Joey>I'm so happy.

273
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:03,840
<8-1,Rachel>谢天谢地你在这里  罗斯  快帮帮我
<8-1,Rachel>Thank God you're here, Ross. Help me.

274
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,280
<8-2,Rachel>你在自言自语吗
<8-2,Rachel>Were you talking to yourself?

275
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:08,430
<8-3,Phoebe>-我出现了  -你就要怀孕了
<8-3,Phoebe>- There I am. - You're gonna get pregnant.

276
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,800
<8-4,Rachel>我搞砸了
<8-4,Rachel>I screwed up so bad.

277
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:13,750
<8-4,Rachel>好几个星期前我告诉莫妮卡
<8-4,Rachel>I told Monica that I'd send

278
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:17,180
<8-4,Rachel>我会把喜帖寄出去
<8-4,Rachel>all those wedding invitations weeks ago.

279
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,430
<8-5,Ross>你没有寄
<8-5,Ross>You didn't do it?

280
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:23,840
<8-6,Rachel>我把它们放在办公桌上  直到今天才想起来
<8-6,Rachel>I put them in my desk at work, and forgot about them until today.

281
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,230
<8-7,Monica>亲爱的  没关系的
<8-7,Monica>Sweetie, it's okay.

282
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:31,630
<8-7,Monica>客人都来了  我没事的
<8-7,Monica>Everybody made it to the wedding. I'm fine.

283
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:36,400
<8-8,Rachel>-但你把我的手弄痛了  -我知道
<8-8,Rachel>- Kind of hurting my hand though. - I know.

284
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,150
<8-9,Monica>我竟然会做出这种事
<8-9,Monica>I can't believe I did this,

285
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:43,070
<8-10,Rachel>何况莫妮卡每天都在嘱咐我这件事
<8-10,Rachel>especially after Monica went on and on and on about it.

286
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:47,790
<8-10,Rachel>喜帖在这里  瑞秋  小心点  瑞秋
<8-10,Rachel>"Okay, Rachel. Here are the invitations, Rachel. Be very careful, Rachel.

287
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:51,280
<8-10,Rachel>拜托  别在喜帖附近喝东西  瑞秋
<8-10,Rachel>Please, drinking no liquids around the invitations, Rachel."

288
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:04,480
<8-11,Chandler>你们在我们的喜帖上面做爱了吗
<8-11,Chandler>Did you do it on our invitations?

289
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:10,240
<8-12,Ross>我们没在寄出去的喜帖上做
<8-12,Ross>Not on the ones we sent out.

290
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:15,890
<8-13,Chandler>你们在我们裱起来的喜帖上面做爱了
<8-13,Chandler>So just the ones you gave back to us and we had framed?

291
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,960
<8-14,Rachel>一切都发生得太快了
<8-14,Rachel>Can you believe it's already happening?

292
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,090
<8-14,Rachel>感觉上他们像是昨天才订婚
<8-14,Rachel>It seems like yesterday they just got engaged.

293
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:29,320
<8-14,Rachel>我知道
<8-14,Rachel>I know.

294
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:33,790
<8-15,Ross>还记得他们订婚那一晚吗
<8-15,Ross>Remember that night they got engaged?

295
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:35,540
<8-15,Ross>你跟我差一点...
<8-15,Ross>How you and I almost...

296
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:38,130
<8-16,Rachel>我记得我们差一点就做了
<8-16,Rachel>Oh, I remember how we almost.

297
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,090
<8-16,Rachel>你觉得我们当时真的会做吗
<8-16,Rachel>You think we would've gone through with it?

298
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:42,920
<8-16,Rachel>如果没被逮到的话
<8-16,Rachel>If we haven't gotten caught.

299
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,670
<8-16,Rachel>你觉得我们会做吗
<8-16,Rachel>You think we would have done it?

300
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:52,310
<8-17,Ross>我知道我想做  但我不知道你想不想
<8-17,Ross>I know I wanted to. I just wasn't sure if you wanted to.

301
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,680
<8-18,Rachel>我也想
<8-18,Rachel>Oh, I wanted to.

302
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:59,390
<8-19,Ross>那么我们两个都想
<8-19,Ross>So we both wanted to.

303
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:02,150
<8-20,Rachel>有意思
<8-20,Rachel>Interesting.

304
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,100
<8-20,Rachel>总之
<8-20,Rachel>Anyway,

305
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:10,850
<8-21,Ross>这样的结果或许是最好的
<8-21,Ross>it probably worked out for the best.

306
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,060
<8-22,Rachel>没错
<8-22,Rachel>Yeah, sure.

307
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:17,370
<8-23,Rachel>再过十秒他就要吻我了
<8-23,Rachel>In about 10 seconds, he kisses me.

308
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:20,440
<8-24,Ross>再过五秒你们就会知道为什么
<8-24,Ross>In about 5 seconds, you'll see why.

309
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:26,610
<8-25,Rachel>我有没有跟你说过
<8-25,Rachel>Ross, did I ever tell you about the time

310
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:29,740
<8-25,Rachel>我到西欧自助旅行的事
<8-25,Rachel>that I went backpacked through Western Europe?

311
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:40,650
<8-26,Rachel>准备看她求我吧
<8-26,Rachel>Get ready to see some begging.

312
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,410
<8-27,Phoebe>是你对罗斯主动的
<8-27,Phoebe>Oh, you came on to Ross!

313
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:45,120
<8-28,Rachel>什么
<8-28,Rachel>What?

314
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,190
<8-29,Ross>现在我好开心
<8-29,Ross>Now I'm so happy.

315
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,050
<8-31,Monica>-你这是什么意思  -你用了欧洲的故事
<8-31,Monica>- What are you talking about? - You used the Europe story!

316
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:55,660
<8-32,Chandler>那是你想做爱时会用的魔法故事
<8-32,Chandler>That's the magic story you use when you want to have sex!

317
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,300
<8-33,Rachel>你怎么知道那个故事
<8-33,Rachel>How do you know about that story?

318
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,680
<8-33,Rachel>你怎么知道那个故事
<8-33,Rachel>How do you know about that story?

319
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:07,170
<8-35,Rachel>是一个家伙告诉我朋友艾琳的
<8-35,Rachel>My friend Irene heard it from some guy.

320
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,770
<8-36,Joey>就是我
<8-36,Joey>Some guy!

321
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:15,590
<8-37,Rachel>不  她说那个家伙叫做肯·亚当斯
<8-37,Rachel>No, she told me that his name was Ken Adams.

322
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,810
<8-38,Joey>我就是肯·亚当斯
<8-38,Joey>Ken Adams!

323
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:33,840
<9-2,Rachel>看来大家都知道欧洲的故事
<9-2,Rachel>So, people are familiar with the Europe story?

324
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:39,270
<9-3,Ross>关于"谁主动"的问题
<9-3,Ross>Yeah. Listen. About that, the "who came on to who" thing

325
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:40,490
<9-3,Ross>真的不重要
<9-3,Ross>really doesn't matter.

326
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:43,100
<9-3,Ross>反正该发生的总会发生
<9-3,Ross>I mean, it would have happened either way.

327
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:47,480
<9-3,Ross>就算你不主动  我也会主动
<9-3,Ross>If you had't initiated it, I know I would have.

328
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,240
<9-4,Rachel>那是个神奇的夜晚
<9-4,Rachel>It was an amazing night.

329
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,640
<9-5,Ross>没错  确实很神奇
<9-5,Ross>It was. It was an amazing night.

330
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:57,920
<9-6,Rachel>你觉得它看起来也很神奇吗
<9-6,Rachel>You think it looked amazing?

331
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:02,720
<9-6,Rachel>我不知道
<9-6,Rachel>I don't know.

332
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,310
<9-7,Ross>我真的没看
<9-7,Ross>I mean, I honestly didn't watch it.

333
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:06,620
<9-8,Rachel>是  我也没看
<9-8,Rachel>Yeah, me neither.

334
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,520
<9-8,Rachel>还没看
<9-8,Rachel>Yet.

335
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:16,720
<9-9,Ross>看的话应该会很奇怪
<9-9,Ross>That may be weird.

336
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,570
<9-10,Rachel>对  会很奇怪
<9-10,Rachel>Yeah, it would be really weird.

<9-12,Rachel>-祝你好运  -祝你好运
<9-12,Rachel>- Good luck. - Good luck to you.

<9-13,Ross>-我可以消音吗  -麻烦你了
<9-13,Ross>- Mind if I mute? - Oh, please.

339
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,650
<9-15,Ross>我们开始脱衣服了
<9-15,Ross>There go the clothes.

340
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:42,690
<9-16,Rachel>你脱衣服的速度真快
<9-16,Rachel>You are undressing awfully quickly.

<9-26,Rachel>这比我之前的经验要好得多...
<9-26,Rachel>This is so much better than I ever...

348
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,120
<9-26,Rachel>那可不太雅观
<9-26,Rachel>Oh, that's not pretty.

<9-26,Rachel>-快点关掉  -不
