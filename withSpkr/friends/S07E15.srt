00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,160
<1-17,Chandler>不管你是指哪个  我希望会有眨眼睛

<1-22,Joey>You're not gonna believe it.

17
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:53,480
<1-22,Joey>我演的角色就要醒过来了
<1-22,Joey>My character is coming out of his coma!

<1-26,Chandler>所以你的工作跟私生活都有了喜事
<1-26,Chandler>So great things are happening at work and in your personal life.

21
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,250
<1-27,Rachel>慢着  什么叫你要换个新脑子
<1-27,Rachel>Wait, what do you mean by you're getting a new brain?

22
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:10,230
<1-28,Joey>他们要踢走剧中一个角色
<1-28,Joey>They're killing off one of the characters on the show...

23
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:13,400
<1-28,Joey>将她的脑子移植到我的身体里
<1-28,Joey>...and her brain is being transplanted into my body.

24
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,900
<1-29,Ross>什么  脑部移植手术
<1-29,Ross>What? A brain transplant?

25
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,410
<1-31,Ross>太荒谬了
<1-31,Ross>It's ridiculous.

26
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:21,560
<1-32,Joey>荒谬的是
<1-32,Joey>It's ridiculous that

27
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,610
<1-32,Joey>你三个半月都没性生活了
<1-32,Joey>you haven't had sex in three and a half months.

<1-33,Ross>现在是冬天  街上人太少
<1-33,Ross>It's winter. There are fewer people on the street.

29
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:35,200
<1-34,Monica>他们要踢走谁

32
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:44,040
<1-39,Rachel>她真的非常擅长泼别人一脸饮料
<1-39,Rachel>She is so good at throwing drinks in people's faces.

33
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,890
<1-39,Rachel>我都没见她喝完过任何一杯饮料
<1-39,Rachel>I don't think I've ever seen her finish a beverage.

34
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,880
<1-42,Monica>她扇人的方式  你不想试试吗  一次也好
<1-42,Monica>The way she slaps people. Wouldn't you love to do that? Just once.

35
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,580
<1-43,Chandler>别
<1-43,Chandler>Don't do it.

36
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,210
<1-45,Joey>她参演这部戏很久了
<1-45,Joey>And she's been on the show forever.

37
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:57,130
<1-45,Joey>取代她一定很难
<1-45,Joey>It's gonna be really hard to fill her shoes.

38
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:57,760
<1-46,Ross>解释一下
<1-46,Ross>Help me out here.

39
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:03,030
<1-46,Ross>当你做过脑部移植手术后
<1-46,Ross>When you come out of the brain transplant...

40
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:06,350
<1-46,Ross>你要变成她
<1-46,Ross>...you are going to be her?

41
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:09,250
<1-47,Joey>但是是用德雷克·拉莫瑞的身体
<1-47,Joey>Yes, but in Drake Ramoray's body.

42
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:13,540
<1-47,Joey>有什么难懂的
<1-47,Joey>Why is this so hard for you to get?

43
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,460
<1-47,Joey>你不是科学家吗
<1-47,Joey>I thought you were a scientist.

55
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:56,870
<2-1,Phoebe>瑞秋  那边那个男的
<2-1,Phoebe>Rach, so that guy there...

56
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:57,960
<2-1,Phoebe>直人还是基友
<2-1,Phoebe>...straight or gay?

57
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,710
<2-6,Rachel>他太帅  肯定是基友
<2-6,Rachel>Oh, yeah, he's too cute to be straight.

58
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,180
<2-7,Phoebe>波霸小姐会帮我们查个清楚
<2-7,Phoebe>Knockers will help us figure it out.

59
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,630
<2-8,Rachel>直人
<2-8,Rachel>All right, straight.

60
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,200
<2-8,Rachel>而且一眼就看得出
<2-8,Rachel>And not subtle.

61
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:21,620
<2-9,Phoebe>他忘了拿手机
<2-9,Phoebe>He left his cell phone.

62
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:24,450
<2-10,Rachel>应该交给甘瑟  放在失物招领处
<2-10,Rachel>We could hand it to Gunther to put it in lost and found.

63
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:27,110
<2-11,Phoebe>或者我们可以拿他电话给中国打电话
<2-11,Phoebe>Or we could use it to call China,

64
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:28,320
<2-11,Phoebe>看看那里的人们怎样
<2-11,Phoebe>see how those guys are doing.

65
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:32,190
<2-12,Rachel>如果他打电话来找手机  我接了电话
<2-12,Rachel>What if he calls his own cell phone and I answer...

66
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:35,830
<2-12,Rachel>我们开始聊天  之后坠入爱河呢
<2-12,Rachel>...and we start talking and we fell in love?

67
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,200
<2-12,Rachel>会是个很棒的故事对吧
<2-12,Rachel>Wouldn't that be a great story?

68
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:41,270
<2-12,Rachel>像是数码时代的通话
<2-12,Rachel>Kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age.

69
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,170
<2-13,Phoebe>听起来很棒  我要去拿手机
<2-13,Phoebe>That does sound great. I'm gonna get the phone.

70
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:47,710
<2-14,Rachel>等一下  为什么你会成为故事的女主角
<2-14,Rachel>What? Wait. Why do you get the story?

71
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:50,650
<2-15,Phoebe>我已经很久没有约会了
<2-15,Phoebe>I don't know. I haven't been out on a date in so long.

72
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,350
<2-16,Rachel>菲比  三天前你才约过会
<2-16,Rachel>Phoebe, you had a date three days ago.

73
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,900
<2-17,Phoebe>那不是约会
<2-17,Phoebe>That wasn't a date.

74
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,180
<2-17,Phoebe>那只是朋友聚会  顺便嘿咻
<2-17,Phoebe>That was friends getting together and having sex.

75
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,550
<2-18,Rachel>好吧  我去拿手机
<2-18,Rachel>Okay. Great. I get the phone.

76
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:03,960
<2-19,Phoebe>不行  一星期前你才跟泰格分手
<2-19,Phoebe>No way. You just broke up with Tag a week ago.

77
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:09,470
<2-20,Rachel>之前我都觉得我很累  不会再爱了
<2-20,Rachel>Yeah, and until now, I didn't think I would love again.

78
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,730
<2-21,Phoebe>-说得挺好  没用  -慢着
<2-21,Phoebe>- Nice try. - Wait.

79
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:15,070
<2-22,Rachel>该如何公平决定谁拿手机呢
<2-22,Rachel>How do we fairly decide who gets the phone?

80
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,140
<2-23,Phoebe>我不知道
<2-23,Phoebe>I don't know.

81
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:26,520
<2-24,Rachel>也许我们应该
<2-24,Rachel>Maybe we could...

82
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,890
<2-24,Rachel>动作太慢
<2-24,Rachel>Aha! Too slow!

83
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:33,890
<2-25,Phoebe>太大意轻敌
<2-25,Phoebe>Aha! Too cocky.

00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,850
<3-3,Dina>你打算怎么做  杀了他吗
<3-3,Dina>What are you going to do, kill him?

87
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,320
<3-3,Dina>就像你杀了查尔斯
<3-3,Dina>Like you did Charles?

88
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:49,480
<3-6,Jessica Lockhart>我的宝贝

<3-10,Dina>-那只是多年的经验  -快拿冰块过来给我
<3-10,Dina>- Oh, just years of experience. - Can I get some ice here?!

<3-11,Joey>我只是觉得你演技很棒
<3-11,Joey>I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are.

94
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,970
<3-12,Cecilia>你该不会是那个濒临死亡的影迷吧
<3-12,Cecilia>You're not the fan who's dying, are you?

97
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,730
<3-17,Joey>因为你离开剧组后
<3-17,Joey>Anyway, I'm gonna say, since I'm getting your brain

98
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:29,680
<3-17,Joey>我要移植你的脑子
<3-17,Joey>when you leave the show...

99
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,780
<3-17,Joey>我在想  你有没有演技小贴士
<3-17,Joey>...I was wondering if there's any tips...

100
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,060
<3-18,Cecilia>我要离开剧组

<3-22,Cecilia>-一个编剧  -哪个  秃头还是高个子
<3-22,Cecilia>- One of the writers. - Which writer? Was it bald or was it tall?

104
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,790
<3-23,Joey>那不重要  因为那不是真的
<3-23,Joey>You know, it doesn't matter, because it is not true.

105
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,110
<3-24,Cecilia>好
<3-24,Cecilia>Okay.

<4-1,Rachel>Why don't we see what kind of numbers he has on his speed dial...

112
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:19,200
<4-1,Rachel>和他有最多共同点的人拿手机
<4-1,Rachel>...and then whoever has more in common with him gets the phone.

125
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,880
<5-3,Monica>听起来是从对街传来的

00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:26,730
<5-6,Chandler>他和我一起出去玩的时候突然说
<5-6,Chandler>He was hanging out with me and said,

129
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:28,580
<5-6,Chandler>"你有一半苏格兰血统  对吧"
<5-6,Chandler>"You're half Scottish, right?"

130
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:32,750
<5-6,Chandler>不可能  不可能是罗斯
<5-6,Chandler>No. There is no way. It cannot be Ross.

131
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:43,960
<6-1,Monica>不可思议  为什么你有苏格兰血统
<6-1,Monica>Unbelievable. Why is your family Scottish?

132
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,520
<6-2,Chandler>为什么罗斯是你哥哥
<6-2,Chandler>Why is your family Ross?

133
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,050
<6-3,Monica>他不能在婚礼上演奏  大家都会跑光的
<6-3,Monica>He cannot play at our wedding. Everyone will leave.

134
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:54,750
<6-3,Monica>你听  纯噪音啊
<6-3,Monica>I mean, come on. That is just noise!

135
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,420
<6-3,Monica>根本都不成调
<6-3,Monica>It's not even a song.

136
00:07:58,490 --> 00:07:59,780
<6-4,Chandler>等一下  如果你仔细听
<6-4,Chandler>Wait. If you listen very carefully...

137
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:04,350
<6-4,Chandler>我想它是库尔与伙伴合唱团的《庆祝》
<6-4,Chandler>...I think it's "Celebration" By Kool and the Gang.

138
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:13,490
<6-4,Chandler>你说的对  他们要将我踢出这部戏
<6-4,Chandler>You're right. They are writing me out of the show.

139
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:16,890
<8-1,Joey>他们还没有决定什么时候  但应该很快
<8-1,Joey>They don't know exactly when it's going to happen, but soon...

140
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,690
<8-2,Dina>木已成舟
<8-2,Dina>...and then that's it.

141
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:20,460
<8-3,Joey>对不起  如果让我决定
<8-3,Joey>I'm so sorry. If it was up to me,

142
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,960
<8-4,Cecilia>我永远不会让你离开
<8-4,Cecilia>you would never leave the show.

143
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,300
<8-5,Joey>-谢谢你  -我是认真的
<8-5,Joey>- Yeah, thanks. - I mean it.

144
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:27,800
<8-6,Cecilia>简直不敢相信他们这么对你  还有你的影迷
<8-6,Cecilia>I can't believe they'd do this to you. And to your fans.

145
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:32,410
<8-7,Joey>他们一定伤心欲绝  他们那么爱你
<8-7,Joey>They're gonna be devastated. Heartbroken. They love you so much.

146
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:34,910
<8-8,Cecilia>你说的对
<8-8,Cecilia>Oh, you're right.

147
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:36,810
<8-8,Cecilia>谢谢
<8-8,Cecilia>Thank you.

148
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,850
<8-8,Cecilia>你说你叫什么名字
<8-8,Cecilia>What's your name again?

149
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:41,680
<8-10,Cecilia>-乔伊  -谢谢
<8-10,Cecilia>- Joey. - Thank you.

150
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,120
<8-10,Cecilia>你太贴心了
<8-10,Cecilia>That is so sweet.

151
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,590
<8-13,Joey>听着  之前我会来找你
<8-13,Joey>Look, the only reason I came up to you before...

152
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:49,580
<8-13,Joey>是因为
<8-13,Joey>...is because, well...

153
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,850
<8-13,Joey>因为要饰演你我真的很紧张
<8-13,Joey>...l'm really nervous about being you.

154
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:54,530
<8-13,Joey>如果你能帮我抓住
<8-13,Joey>If you could help me capture

155
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:56,940
<8-13,Joey>角色的神髓
<8-13,Joey>the essence of the character, you know.

156
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,440
<8-13,Joey>帮助我重现杰西卡  拜托了
<8-13,Joey>Help me keep Jessica alive. Please?

157
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,060
<8-14,Cecilia>好  乔伊  我会帮助你的
<8-14,Cecilia>All right, Joey, I'll help you.

158
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:08,020
<8-14,Cecilia>不是因为我欠这个愚蠢的剧集什么
<8-14,Cecilia>Not because I owe it to this stupid show...

159
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:11,010
<8-14,Cecilia>因为这是我欠杰西卡的
<8-14,Cecilia>...but because I owe it to Jessica.

160
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:14,030
<8-15,Joey>-那真的是太棒了  谢谢你  -别客气
<8-15,Joey>- Oh, that's great. Thank you so much. - You're so welcome.

161
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:16,360
<8-16,Cecilia>我一直在观摩录影带  你觉得这招如何
<8-16,Cecilia>I've been watching some tapes. How's this?

162
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:21,340
<8-17,Joey>杰西卡·罗卡哈德永远不会回来
<8-17,Joey>Jessica Lockhart will never step foot in this place again!

163
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,980
<8-19,Joey>永远
<8-19,Joey>Never!

164
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,180
<8-20,Cecilia>杰西卡不是英国腔啊
<8-20,Cecilia>But Jessica doesn't have an English accent.

165
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:30,800
<8-21,Joey>我还演出英国腔了
<8-21,Joey>I can do an English accent?

166
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,570
<8-21,Joey>我要把这点写在我履历表里
<8-21,Joey>That baby's going on my resume.

167
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,960
<7-5,Rachel>-你好吗  -很好
<7-5,Rachel>- Hi. How are you? - Good.

168
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,950
<7-6,Phoebe>还记得我们在咖啡店
<7-6,Phoebe>Remember when we were in the coffeehouse...

169
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:47,970
<7-7,Rachel>我们决定我可以拿走那个帅哥的手机吗
<7-7,Rachel>...we decided I was gonna keep the cute guy's phone?

170
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,880
<7-8,Phoebe>我准备把手机放在包包里
<7-8,Phoebe>I was gonna keep it

171
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,780
<7-9,Rachel>这样一来电话我就能迅速接听
<7-9,Rachel>in my purse so if it rang, I could just pick it up?

172
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:58,190
<7-10,Phoebe>你记得你摸进我包里把手机偷走了吗
<7-10,Phoebe>Do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?

173
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:00,990
<7-11,Rachel>现在我就听不懂了
<7-11,Rachel>Now you lost me.

174
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,590
<7-12,Phoebe>-你偷走了手机  -不  我没有
<7-12,Phoebe>- You stole the phone. - No, I didn't.

175
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:06,830
<7-13,Rachel>如果我拨号过去它不会响吗
<7-13,Rachel>You're saying that if I called it, it wouldn't ring?

176
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,160
<7-14,Phoebe>-不会  -好
<7-14,Phoebe>- No. - Okay.

177
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,030
<7-15,Rachel>既然你要拨号了
<7-15,Rachel>But while you dial,

178
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:12,970
<7-15,Rachel>来看看我刚买的响铃皮包
<7-15,Rachel>let me show you the features of my new ringing handbag.

179
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,700
<7-15,Rachel>它真的有用
<7-15,Rachel>Oh, it does work.

180
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:20,080
<7-17,Phoebe>-菲比  -是另外一支手机
<7-17,Phoebe>- Phoebe. - That is a different phone.

181
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,080
<7-18,Rachel>是吗  你好  瑞秋在吗
<7-18,Rachel>Oh, is it? Hello. Yes, hi, is Rachel there?

<7-18,Rachel>她在的  稍候  找我的
<7-18,Rachel>Yes, she is. Just one moment, please. It's for me!

183
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:32,490
<7-19,Phoebe>真是如山铁证啊
<7-19,Phoebe>That is damning evidence.

184
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:37,590
<7-19,Phoebe>我的天哪  一定是他
<7-19,Phoebe>Oh, my God. I bet that's him.

185
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,160
<7-20,Rachel>数码童话即将开始
<7-20,Rachel>My digital fairy tale's about to begin.

186
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,320
<7-20,Rachel>你能别那样了吗
<7-20,Rachel>Would you stop doing that?

187
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,430
<7-21,Phoebe>对  我就是捡到你手机的人
<7-21,Phoebe>Hello? Yes, I'm the one who found your phone.

188
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,390
<7-22,Rachel>-菲比  你不能  -我在讲电话
<7-22,Rachel>- Phoebe, you can't... - I'm on a call.

189
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:57,470
<7-23,Phoebe>对  今晚过来拿吧  就八点半吧
<7-23,Phoebe>Yeah, you can pick it up tonight. Say, 8:30?

190
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,570
<7-23,Phoebe>在我公寓
<7-23,Phoebe>At my apartment.

191
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:04,300
<7-23,Phoebe>莫顿街5号  14号公寓
<7-23,Phoebe>It's 5 Morton Street, apartment 14.

192
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,540
<7-23,Phoebe>或许之后
<7-23,Phoebe>And then maybe, you know, after,

193
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,670
<7-23,Phoebe>我们可以一起吃点东西之类的
<7-23,Phoebe>we can grab a bite to eat or whatever.

194
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:11,250
<7-23,Phoebe>好的  到时候见  再见
<7-23,Phoebe>Okay. Okay, I'll see you then. Bye.

195
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,190
<7-24,Rachel>你知道他来的时候我会在这里吧
<7-24,Rachel>You do know that I will be here when he comes over.

196
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,620
<7-25,Phoebe>你怎么知道他什么时候会来
<7-25,Phoebe>How will you know what time to come over?

197
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:21,160
<7-26,Rachel>你刚刚说了
<7-26,Rachel>You just said it.

198
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:34,480
<7-26,Rachel>这个角色的精髓源自于她的自信
<7-26,Rachel>The essence of the character is rooted in her confidence.

199
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:37,490
<7-26,Rachel>譬如说  当洁西卡走进一个房间时
<7-26,Rachel>So when Jessica enters a room, for instance...

200
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,660
<7-26,Rachel>她拥有那个房间里
<7-26,Rachel>...she owns everything...

201
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:43,590
<10-1,Cecilia>所有事物跟所有人
<10-1,Cecilia>...and every person in that room.

202
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:46,930
<10-2,Joey>-你试试看  -好
<10-2,Joey>- You try it. - Okay.

203
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:58,530
<10-3,Cecilia>他也没有对这个房间生气
<10-3,Cecilia>He's not angry at the room either.

204
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:01,550
<10-4,Joey>再试一次  他拥有这个房间
<10-4,Joey>Try it again. He owns it. He owns the room.

205
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:06,360
<10-5,Cecilia>这是他的  他拥有这个房间  他拥有它
<10-5,Cecilia>It is his. He owns, owns, owns the room! He owns it!

206
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:09,260
<10-5,Cecilia>这有点奇怪  但已经好多了
<10-5,Cecilia>It's a little weird, but it's getting better.

207
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:13,550
<10-5,Cecilia>我一定会想念这个女人
<10-5,Cecilia>I'm gonna miss this woman so much.

208
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:15,540
<10-5,Cecilia>我不知道我该怎么办
<10-5,Cecilia>I don't know what I'm gonna do.

209
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:18,040
<10-5,Cecilia>我演这部戏二十年了
<10-5,Cecilia>It's been 20 years of my life.

210
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:22,000
<10-6,Joey>或许这是件好事
<10-6,Joey>Hey, hey. Maybe this is a good thing.

211
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:25,270
<10-6,Joey>给你机会做改变
<10-6,Joey>It'll give you a chance to shake things up.

212
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:26,570
<10-6,Joey>扮演不一样的角色
<10-6,Joey>Play different characters.

213
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:28,070
<10-6,Joey>你才华横溢
<10-6,Joey>You're so talented.

214
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:30,860
<10-8,Joey>或许我该在几年前离开
<10-8,Joey>Probably should've just left years ago

215
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,790
<10-9,Cecilia>那时候很多人要我演戏
<10-9,Cecilia>when the offers were pouring in...

216
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:35,790
<10-9,Cecilia>但我在这里过得太舒服
<10-9,Cecilia>...but I just got so comfy here and...

217
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:38,470
<10-9,Cecilia>我拒绝了一些大好机会
<10-9,Cecilia>I turned down some amazing work.

218
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:40,380
<10-10,Joey>譬如说呢
<10-10,Joey>Like what?

219
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:43,950
<10-11,Cecilia>就说如果我在十五年前离开
<10-11,Cecilia>Well, let's just say if I'd left 15 years ago...

220
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:48,700
<10-11,Cecilia>现在墨西哥影坛会完全不一样
<10-11,Cecilia>...the landscape of Mexican cinema would be very different today.

221
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:58,880
<10-13,Cecilia>但现在现在时机不一样了
<10-13,Cecilia>But, well, now... Now's a different time for me.

222
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:04,720
<10-14,Joey>别自怨自艾
<10-14,Joey>Oh, hey, come on. Don't do this.

223
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,510
<10-14,Joey>我告诉你点事  好吗
<10-14,Joey>Let me tell you something, okay?

224
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:09,100
<10-14,Joey>当我看到你演戏时
<10-14,Joey>When I watch you do a scene,

225
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:12,440
<10-14,Joey>我在想"天啊  她演技真棒"
<10-14,Joey>I'm thinking, "Boy, she is a great actress."

226
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:17,650
<10-14,Joey>但我也在想"她太性感了"
<10-14,Joey>But I'm also thinking, "She is hot."

227
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:21,880
<10-15,Cecilia>你觉得我性感
<10-15,Cecilia>You think I'm hot?

228
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:24,650
<10-16,Joey>你拥有这个房间
<10-16,Joey>You own the room.

229
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:31,390
<10-16,Joey>或许我们应该
<10-16,Joey>We should probably get the...

230
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:33,960
<10-17,Cecilia>对  我们应该
<10-17,Cecilia>Oh, yeah. Yeah, we should get...

231
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:41,620
<10-17,Cecilia>当洁西卡接吻时
<10-17,Cecilia>So when Jessica kisses a man...

232
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:45,590
<10-17,Cecilia>她通常会把
<10-17,Cecilia>...she usually puts...

233
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:48,840
<10-17,Cecilia>双手放在那个男人脸上
<10-17,Cecilia>...both her hands on the man's face.

234
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,680
<10-18,Joey>我注意到了  那是因为她很热情吗
<10-18,Joey>I notice that. Is that because she's so passionate?

235
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,200
<10-19,Cecilia>不  那样摄影机才能只拍到她
<10-19,Cecilia>No, it's because that way the camera only sees her.

236
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:00,860
<10-19,Cecilia>你想试试看吗
<10-19,Cecilia>You want to try it?

237
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:02,970
<10-20,Joey>好的
<10-20,Joey>Yeah, okay.

238
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:17,950
<10-21,Cecilia>太棒了  真的很不错
<10-21,Cecilia>That was good. That was really good.

239
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,250
<10-21,Cecilia>但我想你手的位置不对
<10-21,Cecilia>But I think that maybe your hands

240
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:25,820
<10-21,Cecilia>它们应该
<10-21,Cecilia>are just a little off. They should be right...

241
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,920
<9-1,Chandler>我想吃点点心
<9-1,Chandler>Well, I feel like a snack.

242
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,740
<9-2,Monica>你要吃点脆饼吗 它是你故乡苏格兰的点心
<9-2,Monica>Do you want some shortbread? It's Scottish, like you are.

243
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:44,820
<9-3,Chandler>谢谢  但所有有关苏格兰的东西我都不爱
<9-3,Chandler>Oh, no, thanks. I don't like anything from my Scottish heritage.

244
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,330
<9-4,Ross>什么
<9-4,Ross>What?

245
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:50,830
<9-5,Chandler>就是因为 我全家都被逐出了英格兰
<9-5,Chandler>Well, it's just that my entire family was run out of Scotland by...

246
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,680
<9-6,Ross>是维京人干的
<9-6,Ross>...Vikings.

247
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:55,780
<9-7,Monica>听上去像是
<9-7,Monica>It sounds to me like

248
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:59,410
<9-8,Ross>你的家族已经做好准备重溯苏格兰之根了
<9-8,Ross>you family's ready to rediscover its Scottish roots.

249
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:01,590
<9-9,Monica>你不能在婚礼上吹风笛
<9-9,Monica>You can't play bagpipes at the wedding!

250
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:04,830
<9-10,Ross>你们怎么知道
<9-10,Ross>How did you know about that?

251
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:07,340
<9-11,Chandler>我们在家都听到你吹了
<9-11,Chandler>We heard you play from your apartment.

252
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,960
<9-12,Ross>是你们去报警的
<9-12,Ross>Were you the ones who called the cops?

253
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:13,550
<9-13,Chandler>那不重要
<9-13,Chandler>That's not really important right now.

254
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:17,400
<9-13,Chandler>重要的是  我们谢谢你的好意
<9-13,Chandler>What is important is, while we appreciate the gesture...

255
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,410
<9-13,Chandler>我们只是觉得我们的婚礼
<9-13,Chandler>...we just don't feel that

256
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:21,660
<9-13,Chandler>和风笛不搭调
<9-13,Chandler>bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding.

257
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,890
<9-15,Chandler>-为什么  -因为我们讨厌风笛
<9-15,Chandler>- Why not? - Because we hate them.

258
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,290
<9-17,Chandler>给我个机会给你们表演
<9-17,Chandler>Just give me a chance to perform for you,

259
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:29,430
<9-18,Ross>然后你们再决定
<9-18,Ross>then decide whatever you want.

260
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:32,380
<9-18,Ross>我也不会告诉你们我要吹哪首曲子
<9-18,Ross>I'm not gonna tell you what song I'm gonna play either.

261
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:35,400
<9-18,Ross>只不过在曲子结束之后
<9-18,Ross>Let's just say when it's over...

262
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:39,300
<9-18,Ross>我们肯定会小小庆祝一番
<9-18,Ross>...l'll bet there'll be a wee bit of celebration.
