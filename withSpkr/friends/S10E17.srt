28
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,470
<2-3,Monica>吓死她了
<2-3,Monica>and it scared her.

<2-8,Chandler>-别把我们俩丢在一起啊 -说什么
<2-8,Chandler>- You can't leave me alone with her. - What?

34
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:40,100
<2-9,Monica>这就是那种社交场合
<2-9,Monica>This is exactly the kind of social situation...

35
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,660
<2-10,Chandler>我最怕的那种
<2-10,Chandler>...that I am not comfortable with.

36
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:46,710
<2-11,Monica>什么样的场合你不怕啊
<2-11,Monica>What kind of social situation are you comfortable with?

37
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,840
<2-12,Chandler>我和她从来没单独待在一起过
<2-12,Chandler>It's just that we've never spent any time, you know, alone together.

38
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,480
<2-13,Monica>没事的
<2-13,Monica>You'll be fine.

40
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:56,130
<2-14,Chandler>好的
<2-14,Chandler>Okay.

41
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:07,500
<2-15,Chandler>那个...夏天有什么打算
<2-15,Chandler>So any plans for the summer?

42
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:12,490
<2-16,Erica>不清楚  可能参加个教会野营吧
<2-16,Erica>I don't know. Maybe church camp.

43
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,040
<2-17,Chandler>那你去的时候  最好不要提起生孩子这件事
<2-17,Chandler>May not want to mention this.

44
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,600
<2-17,Chandler>有没想过哪种情况更疼
<2-17,Chandler>So you ever wonder which is worse?

45
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,170
<2-17,Chandler>产前阵痛和老二被踢
<2-17,Chandler>You know, going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts?

46
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,910
<2-19,Chandler>-说什么   -就是想想挺有意思的
<2-19,Chandler>- What? - Oh, it's just interesting.

47
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,060
<2-19,Chandler>谁也不会知道的
<2-19,Chandler>Because no one will ever know

48
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,950
<2-19,Chandler>因为没人两种情况都能经历吧
<2-19,Chandler>because no one can experience both.

49
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:45,190
<2-20,Chandler>世界上又一无法解答的难题
<2-20,Chandler>One of life's great unanswerable questions.

50
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,510
<2-20,Chandler>谁知道  也许还有
<2-20,Chandler>Who knows? Maybe there's something

51
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:51,350
<2-20,Chandler>比那两种情况更糟糕的呢
<2-20,Chandler>even more painful than those things.

52
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,010
<2-20,Chandler>比如现在
<2-20,Chandler>Like this.

53
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,890
<3-1,Phoebe>-进  -早啊
<3-1,Phoebe>- Come in. - Morning.

54
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:06,000
<3-3,Phoebe>-嗨   -这是什么啊
<3-3,Phoebe>- Hey. - What's that?

55
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,290
<3-4,Joey>送莫妮卡和钱德勒的乔迁礼
<3-4,Joey>Oh, it's my housewarming present for Monica and Chandler.

56
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,970
<3-5,Phoebe>刚出生的小鸡和小鸭
<3-5,Phoebe>That's a baby chick and duck.

57
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:16,070
<3-6,Joey>我给它俩取名叫小小鸡和小小鸭
<3-6,Joey>And I named them Chick Jr. And Duck Jr.

58
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:18,590
<3-7,Phoebe>真的是没想到哈
<3-7,Phoebe>I did not see that coming.

59
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,840
<3-8,Joey>那么大个后院
<3-8,Joey>They'll love it at that new house.

60
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:22,440
<3-8,Joey>它俩肯定会喜欢的
<3-8,Joey>It has that big backyard.

61
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,440
<3-8,Joey>以后要是老了的话
<3-8,Joey>When they're old,

62
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:24,750
<3-8,Joey>钱德勒可以和上次一样把它们送到
<3-8,Joey>they'll go to that farm...

63
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,520
<3-8,Joey>上次那个特别农场去
<3-8,Joey>...that Chandler took the other chick and duck to.

64
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:30,730
<3-9,Phoebe>-没错  -是啊
<3-9,Phoebe>- Yes. - Yeah.

65
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:32,560
<3-10,Joey>不过不能去看望实在是太不爽了
<3-10,Joey>It's a shame people can't visit there.

66
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,700
<3-11,Phoebe>没办法  规矩就是这样
<3-11,Phoebe>That is the rule though.

67
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,950
<3-12,Phoebe>好消息  你马上就当舅舅了
<3-12,Phoebe>Guess what. You're almost an uncle.

68
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:41,570
<3-13,Ross>什么
<3-13,Ross>What?

69
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,170
<3-14,Joey>艾瑞卡昨晚要生了
<3-14,Joey>Erica went into labor last night.

70
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:44,900
<3-14,Joey>莫妮卡和钱德勒现在正在医院呢
<3-14,Joey>Monica and Chandler are at the hospital right now.

71
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:48,240
<3-16,Phoebe>-天呐   -我敢肯定是个女孩
<3-16,Phoebe>- Oh, my God! - I have a feeling it's gonna be a girl.

72
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,850
<3-17,Ross>你原来还猜本是个女孩来着呢
<3-17,Ross>Phoebe, you were sure Ben was gonna be a girl.

73
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:52,900
<3-18,Phoebe>你看他扔过球吗
<3-18,Phoebe>Have you seen him throw a ball?

<3-19,Ross>-瑞秋在不在  -还在睡觉吧
<3-19,Ross>- Is Rachel here? - I think she's still asleep.

00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,060
<3-20,Joey>昨晚你俩怎么样了
<3-20,Joey>How did it go with you guys last night?

76
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,190
<3-20,Joey>她好像怒了
<3-20,Joey>She seemed pretty pissed at you.

77
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:06,560
<3-21,Ross>后来事情解决了
<3-21,Ross>We worked things out.

78
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,080
<3-22,Phoebe>笑啥呢
<3-22,Phoebe>What's that smile?

79
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,740
<3-22,Phoebe>你俩是不是有事儿
<3-22,Phoebe>Did something happen with you two?

80
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,300
<3-23,Ross>我这人办完事以后不喜欢到处宣传
<3-23,Ross>Hey, I'm not one to kiss and tell.

81
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,880
<3-23,Ross>不过我也不会藏着不说
<3-23,Ross>But I'm also not one to have sex and shut up.

82
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,720
<3-23,Ross>我俩做爱了
<3-23,Ross>We totally did it.

00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,320
<3-25,Ross>是啊  感觉太棒了
<3-25,Ross>I know, it's pretty great.

85
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,460
<3-26,Joey>意味着什么啊
<3-26,Joey>So, what does that mean?

86
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,950
<3-26,Joey>你们复合了
<3-26,Joey>Are you guys getting back together?

87
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,620
<3-27,Ross>说不好
<3-27,Ross>Oh, I don't know.

88
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,290
<3-27,Ross>我俩还没仔细谈过
<3-27,Ross>We didn't really get to talk.

89
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:30,090
<3-28,Phoebe>但你自己想复合吗
<3-28,Phoebe>But do you want to get back together?

90
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:31,570
<3-28,Phoebe>不清楚啊
<3-28,Phoebe>I don't know.

91
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,580
<3-29,Ross>真的是难以置信
<3-29,Ross>It was incredible.

92
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:36,160
<3-29,Ross>感觉太对了
<3-29,Ross>I mean, it just felt so right.

93
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,950
<3-29,Ross>我把她抱在怀里时
<3-29,Ross>When I was holding her,

94
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:40,760
<3-29,Ross>永远都不想让她离开
<3-29,Ross>I mean, I never wanted to let her go.

<3-29,Ross>没错  我想和她在一起
<3-29,Ross>Know what? Yeah, I do. I want to be together.

<3-33,Joey>So is she still going to Paris?

97

<3-35,Phoebe>...in the world again.

103
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:06,320
<3-35,Phoebe>感觉就像在音乐剧中一样
<3-35,Phoebe>I feel like I'm in a musical.

<3-47,Rachel>小鸡和小鸭  不是已经死...
<3-47,Rachel>Chick and the duck? Didn't they die--?

<3-53,Rachel>我今天醒来满脸都是笑容
<3-53,Rachel>I woke up today with a big smile in my face.

118
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:03,800
<3-54,Ross>我也是啊
<3-54,Ross>I know, me too. It was....

119
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:06,240
<3-54,Ross>就像...
<3-54,Ross>You know, it was one of those things

120
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,770
<3-54,Ross>有些事情觉得从来不可能
<3-54,Ross>you think is never going to happen.

121
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:09,260
<3-54,Ross>但有一天真的发生了
<3-54,Ross>And then it does,

122
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:11,890
<3-54,Ross>而且是自己所希望的那样
<3-54,Ross>and it's everything you want it to be.

123
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:14,740
<3-55,Rachel>我知道  实在是...
<3-55,Rachel>I know. It was just....

124
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:18,980
<3-55,Rachel>实在是最好的告别方式了
<3-55,Rachel>It's just the perfect way to say goodbye.

125
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:28,990
<4-1,Monica>再使点劲  亲爱的
<4-1,Monica>Just a little bit more, honey.

128
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:33,790
<4-4,Erica>现在该踢你老二
<4-4,Erica>I think it's time to kick you in the nuts

129
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,930
<4-4,Erica>看看哪个更疼
<4-4,Erica>and see which is worse.

130
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:40,420
<4-5,Doctor>婴儿的头已经要出来了
<4-5,Doctor>The baby's head is crowning.

<4-6,Monica>-钱德勒 过来看   -我就不用了
<4-6,Monica>- Chandler, you have to see this. - I'm okay.

00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,050
<4-8,Monica>钱德勒  绝不能错过的
<4-8,Monica>Chandler. You don't want to miss this.

135
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:53,610
<4-8,Monica>你孩子出生了
<4-8,Monica>This is the birth of your child.

<4-32,Doctor>-你们知道是双胞胎吧   -才怪
<4-32,Doctor>- You know it's twins, right? - Oh, yeah.

<4-33,Chandler>知道我们俩还能这副表情
<4-33,Chandler>These are the faces of two people in the know.

167
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:57,270
<5-1,Doctor>怎么可能不知道是双胞胎
<5-1,Doctor>I can't believe you didn't know it's twins.

168
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,580
<5-1,Doctor>以前从来没有过的
<5-1,Doctor>This has never happened before.

169
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:02,170
<5-2,Chandler>这让我感觉又特殊又好啊
<5-2,Chandler>Well, gosh. That makes me feel so special and good.

170
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,370
<5-3,Monica>等等  你知道是双胞胎
<5-3,Monica>Wait. Did you know it was twins?

171
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,340
<5-4,Doctor>是啊  俄亥俄州送过来的文件里面写着呢
<5-4,Doctor>It's here in the paperwork we got from the clinic in Ohio.

172
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:10,460
<5-5,Monica>-有人告诉过你吗   -没有啊
<5-5,Monica>- Did anybody tell you? - I don't think so.

173
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:13,490
<5-6,Erica>不过确实提到了两种心跳
<5-6,Erica>They did mention two heartbeats,

174
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:15,680
<5-6,Erica>我当时觉得应该就是我和孩子的吧
<5-6,Erica>but l thought it was just mine and the baby's.

175
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,530
<5-6,Erica>他们就一直说两个心跳都很强
<5-6,Erica>They said, "Both heartbeats are strong."

176
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:20,380
<5-6,Erica>我就觉得不错啊 因为我正怀着孩子呢
<5-6,Erica>And I thought, "Well, that's good, because I'm having a baby."

177
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,700
<5-7,Monica>太难以置信了
<5-7,Monica>This is unbelievable.

178
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,450
<5-8,Erica>我家有生双胞胎的传统
<5-8,Erica>Twins actually run in my family.

<5-9,Chandler>真有意思哈
<5-9,Chandler>Interesting.

180
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,390
<5-9,Chandler>跟你谈点事
<5-9,Chandler>Can I see you for a second?

181
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:34,130
<5-10,Chandler>现在咋办
<5-10,Chandler>What do we do?

182
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:35,400
<5-11,Monica>什么咋办
<5-11,Monica>What do you mean, "What do we do?"

<5-14,Chandler>我们留一个
<5-14,Chandler>What do you say we keep one

188
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:49,150
<5-14,Chandler>另一个给别人如何
<5-14,Chandler>and then just have an option on the other one?

189
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,860
<5-15,Monica>-怎么可以分开啊  -为什么不行啊
<5-15,Monica>- We can't split them up. - Why not?

190
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,330
<5-16,Chandler>给他俩一人半块信物
<5-16,Chandler>We could give each of them half a medallion.

191
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:57,400
<5-16,Chandler>数年之后他们凭着信物重逢
<5-16,Chandler>And then years later, they'll find each other...

192
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:01,420
<5-16,Chandler>大团圆
<5-16,Chandler>...and be reunited.

<5-16,Chandler>到那时候大家该多开心啊
<5-16,Chandler>I mean, that's a great day for everybody.

194
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:07,220
<5-17,Monica>如果领养另一个人的是坏蛋呢
<5-17,Monica>What if the person who adopts the other one is horrible?

195
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,650
<5-18,Chandler>要不是呢
<5-18,Chandler>What if they're not?

196
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:10,410
<5-18,Chandler>要是被某国王领养了呢
<5-18,Chandler>What if it's adopted by a king?

197
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:13,680
<5-19,Monica>是哈  听说国王要领养个孩子
<5-19,Monica>Yeah. Because I hear the king is looking to adopt.

<5-20,Chandler>莫妮卡  咱俩没想好要两个孩子的
<5-20,Chandler>Monica, we are not ready to have two babies.

00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:19,080
<5-21,Monica>又有什么关系
<5-21,Monica>That doesn't matter.

00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:21,000
<5-21,Monica>咱们等了这么久
<5-21,Monica>We have waited so long for this.

201
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,770
<5-21,Monica>我才不管是一个孩子还是两个孩子
<5-21,Monica>I don't care if it's two babies.

00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:24,300
<5-21,Monica>仨孩子都没关系
<5-21,Monica>I don't care if it's three babies.

203
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:28,550
<5-21,Monica>生出《八宝喜事》全剧组来都没关系
<5-21,Monica>I don't care if the entire cast of Eight Is Enough comes out of there.

204
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,980
<5-21,Monica>一定要把他们带回家
<5-21,Monica>We are taking them home

205
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:33,220

<5-22,Chandler>好吧

215
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,620
<5-32,Chandler>然后就别再生了
<5-32,Chandler>And that's enough.

216
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:07,090
<6-1,Ross>后来她说那是最好的告别方式
<6-1,Ross>And then she said it was the perfect way to say goodbye.

<6-2,Joey>天呐  你说什么了
<6-2,Joey>Oh, my God. What did you say?

<6-4,Phoebe>罗斯  一定要告诉她你的感受啊

00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,790
<6-9,Phoebe>如果她知道 想法可能就会变啊
<6-9,Phoebe>If she did, she might feel differently.

226
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,750
<6-9,Phoebe>也许就不会走了
<6-9,Phoebe>She might not even go.

<8-60,Rachel>一定  罗斯  过来
<8-60,Rachel>I will. Ross, come here.

372
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,040
<8-61,Rachel>我想告诉你
<8-61,Rachel>I just want you to know...

373
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:51,330
<8-61,Rachel>昨晚
<8-61,Rachel>...last night...

374
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:55,140
<8-61,Rachel>我永远都不会忘记的
<8-61,Rachel>...I'll never forget it.

375
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,740
<8-62,Ross>我也不会
<8-62,Ross>Neither will l.

376
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,400
<8-63,Rachel>好吧  现在真的要走了
<8-63,Rachel>All right. Now I really have to go.

377
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,580
<8-63,Rachel>再见
<8-63,Rachel>Okay, au revoir.

378
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,330
<8-63,Rachel>到那他们一定会恨死我的
<8-63,Rachel>They're gonna really hate me over there.

379
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:20,110
<8-64,Phoebe>你就这么让她走了
<8-64,Phoebe>So you just let her go?

380
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,730
<8-65,Ross>嗯
<8-65,Ross>Yeah.

381
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,810
<8-66,Joey>-这样也许是最好的了 -是吗
<8-66,Joey>- Hey, maybe that's for the best. - Yeah?

382
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:30,150
<8-68,Joey>是的  关于昨晚
<8-68,Joey>Yeah. You know, you just-- Look, you gotta--

383
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:33,000
<8-68,Joey>她怎么想你也应该怎么想
<8-68,Joey>You gotta think about last night the way she does.

384
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,170
<8-68,Joey>也许...也许上床
<8-68,Joey>Okay? You know, maybe....

385
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:39,870
<8-69,Phoebe>就是最好的告别了
<8-69,Phoebe>Maybe sleeping together was the perfect way to say goodbye.

386
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:42,110
<8-69,Phoebe>可是这样一来她就不知道他的感受了啊
<8-69,Phoebe>Now she'll never know how he feels.

387
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,840
<8-70,Joey>也许没关系的
<8-70,Joey>Maybe that's okay, you know?

388
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,730
<8-70,Joey>也许这样更好
<8-70,Joey>Maybe it is better this way.

389
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:51,040
<8-70,Joey>现在...现在你可以向前继续生活了
<8-70,Joey>I mean, now.... Now you can move on.

390
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:54,090
<8-70,Joey>你已经努力适应这么久了
<8-70,Joey>I mean, you've been trying to for so long.

391
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:56,870
<8-70,Joey>现在你们俩身在不同的大陆...
<8-70,Joey>Maybe now that you're on different continents....

392
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,700
<8-70,Joey>是吧
<8-70,Joey>Right?

393
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:05,090
<8-71,Joey>也许你现在终于可以解脱了
<8-71,Joey>Maybe now you can actually do it, you know.

394
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:09,410
<8-71,Joey>终于可以不再想她了
<8-71,Joey>You can finally get over her.

395
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,660
<8-71,Joey>的确是这样没错
<8-71,Joey>Yeah, that's true.

396
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:18,670
<8-72,Ross>可是...
<8-72,Ross>Except....

397
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:23,080
<8-72,Ross>我不愿意就这样解脱
<8-72,Ross>I don't want to get over her.

398
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:23,970
<8-73,Joey>什么
<8-73,Joey>What?

399
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:26,190
<8-74,Ross>我不想  我想和她在一起
<8-74,Ross>I don't. I want to be with her.

400
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:26,900
<8-52,Mike>真的
<8-52,Mike>Really?

401

405
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,970
<8-82,Chandler>虽然一点都不明白咋回事
<8-82,Chandler>I have no idea what's going on,

406
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:39,890
<8-82,Chandler>不过我现在太兴奋了
<8-82,Chandler>but I am excited!

407
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:41,880
<8-83,Joey>罗斯  你觉得她会怎么说
<8-83,Joey>What do you think she's gonna say?

408
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,640
<8-83,Joey>不知道
<8-83,Joey>I don't know.

409
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,080
<8-84,Ross>不过即便她拒绝我
<8-84,Ross>Even if she shoots me down,

410
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,230
<8-84,Ross>我也不会余生都活在猜测之中
<8-84,Ross>at least I won't spend my life wondering...

411
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:49,840
<8-84,Ross>我外套哪儿去了
<8-84,Ross>...what would have happened. Where is my coat?

412
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,880
<8-85,Phoebe>你根本就没穿来
<8-85,Phoebe>You didn't bring one!

<9-2,Phoebe>...the engine will explode,

420
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,980
<9-2,Phoebe>相比之下还是被甩出去比较好
<9-2,Phoebe>so it's better if you're thrown from the car.

456
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:30,910
<13-6,Joey>一定是从桌子上跳下去了
<13-6,Joey>But they must've jumped off the table.

457
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:31,850
<13-6,Joey>现在都不见了啊

<13-11,Joey>没事了  就是个蛋卷
<13-11,Joey>It's okay. It's just an egg roll.

00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:44,510
<13-12,Chandler>你竟敢踩我的蛋卷
<13-12,Chandler>You stepped on my egg roll?!

463
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:46,650
<13-14,Joey>抱歉

<13-15,Monica>谁会想到地上会有中国菜
<13-15,Monica>I didn't know to look for Chinese food on the floor.

465
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:51,390
<13-16,Joey>放到盘子里  然后快走
<13-16,Joey>Just put it on a plate and leave.

466
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:58,390
<13-17,Chandler>-好了  开始找吧  -好
<13-17,Chandler>- Okay. Let's find these birds. - All right.

468
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:09,020
<13-20,Joey>在桌子里
<13-20,Joey>They're in the table!

469
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,510
<13-21,Chandler>这可不妙了
<13-21,Chandler>Well, that can't be good.

470
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,880
<13-22,Joey>-必须要取出来  -怎么取
<13-22,Joey>- We gotta get them out of there! - How?

471
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,400
<13-24,Joey>也许能引诱他们出来  你知道鸟怎么叫吗
<13-24,Joey>Maybe we can lure them out. You know any birdcalls?

472
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,110
<13-25,Chandler>当然了  我就是干伐木工的
<13-25,Chandler>Oh, tons. I'm quite the woodsman.

473
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:23,840
<13-26,Joey>把桌子一头抬起来点也许管用
<13-26,Joey>Well, maybe we can just tip the table a little.

474
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,200
<13-27,Chandler>乔伊等一下  球
<13-27,Chandler>Joey, wait! The ball!

475
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,330
<13-29,Joey>现在怎么办
<13-29,Joey>So, what do we do?

476
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:46,450
<13-30,Chandler>不清楚  也许边上什么地方能打开吧
<13-30,Chandler>Maybe we can open this up somehow.

477
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:47,800
<13-31,Joey>好
<13-31,Joey>Okay.

478
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,810
<13-32,Chandler>不行啊  都粘上了
<13-32,Chandler>No. It's all glued together.

479
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:56,260
<13-33,Joey>也就是说要生撬开
<13-33,Joey>Does that mean we have to bust it open?

480
00:25:56,260 --> 00:26:00,240
<13-34,Chandler>-不知道也许吧  -天呐
<13-34,Chandler>- I don't know. Maybe. - Oh, my God.

481
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,570
<13-36,Chandler>我明白  这可是足球桌啊
<13-36,Chandler>I know. It's-- It's the foosball table.

482
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:09,360
<13-37,Joey>没有办法了
<13-37,Joey>All right, you know what? We don't have a choice.

483
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,100
<13-37,Joey>就像我在一部科幻电影里面的台词一样
<13-37,Joey>It's like I would have said in that sci-fi movie

484
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,010
<13-37,Joey>如果我当初赢到角色的话
<13-37,Joey>if I'd have gotten the part.

485
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:17,760
<13-37,Joey>"里面是我们的人  必须要救出来"
<13-37,Joey>Those are our men in there, and we have to get them out...

486
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:22,030
<13-37,Joey>"即使要牺牲我生命中最重要的东西...
<13-37,Joey>...even if I have to sacrifice the most important thing in my life...

487

00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,310
<21-13,Rachel>让我下飞机
<21-13,Rachel>She told me to get off the plane

603
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:30,400
<21-13,Rachel>因为她就是感觉到
<21-13,Rachel>because she had a "feeling" that there...

604
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,900
<21-10,Phoebe>飞机左"弗兰基"有毛病
<21-10,Phoebe>...was something wrong with the left phalange.

605
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:37,350
<21-13,Rachel>听起来可不妙吧
<21-13,Rachel>Okay. That doesn't sound good.

606
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:38,500
<21-14,Rachel>不用担心
<21-14,Rachel>Oh, I wouldn't worry about it.

607
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,880
<21-14,Rachel>她老是这样
<21-14,Rachel>She comes up with this stuff,

608
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,330
<21-14,Rachel>而且几乎从没对过
<21-14,Rachel>and she's almost never right.

609
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:43,300
<21-14,Rachel>也就是说她也有对的时候
<21-14,Rachel>But she is sometimes.

610
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,660
<21-15,Rachel>啊
<21-15,Rachel>Well....

611
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,380
<21-16,Rachel>你要干吗
<21-16,Rachel>What are you doing?

612
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,760
<21-16,Rachel>这飞机我不能坐
<21-16,Rachel>I can't take this plane now.

613
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,510
<21-17,Air stewardess>对不起先生  您去哪里
<21-17,Air stewardess>Excuse me, sir. Where are you going?

614
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:52,100
<21-12,Rachel>我要下飞机
<21-12,Rachel>I have to get off this plane.

615
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:54,510
<21-13,Rachel>她朋友感觉到
<21-13,Rachel>Her friend has a feeling

616
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:57,210
<21-10,Phoebe>飞机左"弗兰基"有毛病
<21-10,Phoebe>something's wrong with the left phalange.

617
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:03,040
<21-18,Rachel>请给我拿点花生好吗
<21-18,Rachel>Could I get some peanuts?

618
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:04,920
<21-19,Air stewardess>飞机怎么了
<21-19,Air stewardess>What's wrong with the plane?

619
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,250
<21-19,Air stewardess>飞机一点异常都没有
<21-19,Air stewardess>There's nothing wrong.

620
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:08,360
<21-20,Air stewardess>左"弗兰基"有毛病了
<21-20,Air stewardess>The left phalange.

621
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,180
<21-20,Air stewardess>根本就没有什么"弗兰基"
<21-20,Air stewardess>There's no "phalange."

622
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:13,480
<21-20,Air stewardess>天呐  这破飞机连"弗兰基"都没有
<21-20,Air stewardess>Oh, my God. This plane doesn't even have a phalange.

623
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:16,360
<21-21,Air stewardess>-我不飞了 -女士  请您坐好
<21-21,Air stewardess>- I'm not flying on it. - Ma'am. Please sit down.

624
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,450
<23-11,Rachel>出什么事情了
<23-11,Rachel>What's going on?

625
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:20,790
<21-20,Air stewardess>我们都下去  飞机上根本就没有"弗兰基"
<21-20,Air stewardess>We're getting off. There is no phalange!

626
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:27,620
<21-22,Rachel>太荒谬了吧  我...
<21-22,Rachel>This is ridiculous. I--

627
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:31,140
<21-23,Rachel>啊随便吧
<21-23,Rachel>Yeah, okay.

00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:42,790
<22-1,Monica>好了  工作完成
<22-1,Monica>All right. My job here is done.

629
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:46,580
<22-2,Chandler>你太强了
<22-2,Chandler>That was impressive.

630
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:50,320
<22-3,Joey>大部分连工具都没用就弄下来了
<22-3,Joey>Yeah. You didn't even use the tools for most of it.

631
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,560
<22-4,Monica>啊  工具太碍事了
<22-4,Monica>Yeah, they were just slowing me down.

632
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:56,400
<22-4,Monica>好啦  我回去看孩子了
<22-4,Monica>All right. I gotta get back to the babies.

633
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,190
<22-4,Monica>你们俩个丫头一会儿见
<22-4,Monica>See you girls later.

<22-5,Chandler>-真抱歉阿  桌子这样了  -嗯
<22-5,Chandler>- Sorry about the table, man. - Yeah.

00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:07,600
<22-7,Chandler>要买新的吗
<22-7,Chandler>You gonna buy a new one?

636
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:11,400
<22-8,Joey>也许不会了
<22-8,Joey>Probably not. No.

637
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,820
<22-8,Joey>你走后我估计
<22-8,Joey>I don't know how much I'm gonna want to play

638
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:14,300
<22-8,Joey>也不会怎么玩了
<22-8,Joey>after you go.

639
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,940
<22-9,Chandler>-至少这两个小家伙救出来了 -是啊
<22-9,Chandler>- At least we got these little guys out. - Yeah.

640
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:23,600
<22-11,Chandler>我们还担心你们呢
<22-11,Chandler>We were worried about you.

641
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:29,720
<22-11,Chandler>以后就多习惯有东西
<22-11,Chandler>I guess I better get used to things

642
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,950
<22-11,Chandler>在我手里拉屎吧
<22-11,Chandler>crapping in my hand, huh?

643
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,350
<22-12,Joey>我会想你们的  小家伙
<22-12,Joey>I'm gonna miss these little guys.

644
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:45,770
<22-12,Joey>再养养鸟还真挺不错的
<22-12,Joey>It was nice having birds around again.

645
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:48,690
<22-12,Joey>这样吧
<22-12,Joey>Hey, you know what?

646
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,080
<22-13,Chandler>它们就交给你了
<22-13,Chandler>Maybe we should keep them here with you.

647
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:52,240
<22-14,Joey>什么
<22-14,Joey>What?

648
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,510
<22-15,Chandler>嗯  我们现在也忙得要死
<22-15,Chandler>Yeah. We got a lot going on right now.

649
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:57,190
<22-15,Chandler>而且这里也有它们的房间啊
<22-15,Chandler>And plus, here, they'd have their own room.

650
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,640
<22-16,Joey>还可以再养只鹅
<22-16,Joey>I could get a goose!

651
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:05,880
<22-17,Chandler>我觉得家禽类这两只就够了
<22-17,Chandler>You know, I think you're set with the poultry.

652
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:10,870
<22-18,Joey>多谢了  听到没有
<22-18,Joey>Thanks, man. You hear that, you guys?

654
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:15,000
<22-18,Joey>而且这样也挺好的
<22-18,Joey>And it's good...

655
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:16,610
<22-18,Joey>因为
<22-18,Joey>...you know, because....

656
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:19,010
<22-18,Joey>你就有理由
<22-18,Joey>Because now you have a reason

657
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,730
<22-18,Joey>多回来看看了
<22-18,Joey>to come visit.

658
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:26,430
<22-19,Chandler>其实还有另外一个理由
<22-19,Chandler>I think there may be another reason.

659
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:36,080
<22-19,Chandler>那么...
<22-19,Chandler>So....

660
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:42,920
<22-19,Chandler>尴尬的拥抱呢  还是假酷男握手呢
<22-19,Chandler>Awkward hug or lame cool-guy handshake?

661
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:45,220
<22-19,Chandler>啊  那好
