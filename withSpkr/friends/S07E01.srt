<10-1,Ross>莫妮卡  亲爱的  你刚刚看到的
<10-1,Ross>Okay, Monica, Mon. Okay, what you just saw...

167
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:58,180
<10-2,Monica>我能问你个小问题吗  为什么一定得在今天晚上
<10-2,Monica>Can I ask you just a little question? Why tonight?

168
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:01,960
<10-4,Monica>-什么  -我等着订婚已经等了一辈子
<10-4,Monica>- What? - I've been waiting for my whole life to be engaged...

169
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,490
<10-4,Monica>不像某些人  我只打算结一次婚
<10-4,Monica>...and unlike some, I only plan on doing this once.

170
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,550
<10-4,Monica>也许我太自私了  对不起
<10-4,Monica>So you know, maybe it's selfish, I'm sorry.

171
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:12,630
<10-4,Monica>但我希望今晚能只属于我
<10-4,Monica>But I hoped tonight could just be about that.

172
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:14,630
<10-5,Rachel>亲爱的  今夜就是只属于你的
<10-5,Rachel>Oh honey, but it is just about that.

00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,270
<10-7,Monica>现在这是你的复合之夜了
<10-7,Monica>Now it's about you and Ross getting back together.

174
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:20,130
<10-9,Monica>看  你们有点喧宾夺主了
<10-9,Monica>See, you kind of stole my thunder.

175
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,980
<10-10,Ross>我们没有喧宾夺主  因为我们没有复合
<10-10,Ross>We did not steal your thunder. Because we are not getting back together.

176
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:28,480
<10-11,Rachel>对  我们没有  而且都没人看见
<10-11,Rachel>Yeah, no, and you know what? Nobody even saw.

177
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,250
<10-12,Ross>也对
<10-12,Ross>That's true.

178
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,530
<10-14,Rachel>-我们就是接吻而已  -就是一个吻
<10-14,Rachel>- We just kissed. - It was just a kiss.

179
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:35,790
<10-15,Ross>你们接吻了
<10-15,Ross>You guys kissed?!

180
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,660
<10-16,Phoebe>代表着什么
<10-16,Phoebe>What does this mean?!

181
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:42,830
<10-16,Phoebe>你们复合了吗  我能在你们婚礼上献唱吗
<10-16,Phoebe>Are you back together? Can I sing at your wedding?

182
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,100
<10-17,Monica>喧宾夺主了
<10-17,Monica>Thunder being stolen.

183
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:49,870
<10-19,Ross>-菲比  那不算什么  -别大惊小怪的
<10-19,Ross>- Phoebe, it's nothing. - Let's not make a big deal of this.

184
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:53,040
<10-19,Ross>就只是一瞬而过  不作数的
<10-19,Ross>It was a one-time thing. It doesn't even matter.

185
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:54,640
<10-19,Ross>天啊
<10-19,Ross>Oh, my God.

186
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,480
<10-20,Joey>我简直不敢相信你们居然在讨论这个
<10-20,Joey>I cannot believe you guys are talking about this.

187
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:02,550
<10-20,Joey>闺房秘事应该在两人之间解决
<10-20,Joey>Problems in the bedroom are between a man and a woman.

188
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:08,150
<10-20,Joey>钱德勒已经尽力了
<10-20,Joey>All right? Now, Chandler is doing the best he can.

189
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,390
<10-21,Chandler>我不觉得他们在讨论这个
<10-21,Chandler>I don't think that's what they were talking about, Joe.

190
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,460
<10-22,Phoebe>多美好的一夜啊  钱德勒不举  他们接吻
<10-22,Phoebe>What a great night. Chandler can't do it, they kissed.

191
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,100
<10-24,Chandler>-什么  -你们接吻了  这可是大事
<10-24,Chandler>- What? - You guys kissed? This is huge.

192
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,360
<10-27,Ross>不  不是大事
<10-27,Ross>No, it's not huge.

193
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,500
<10-29,Ross>你们都大惊小怪  这让莫妮卡觉得
<10-29,Ross>People thinking it's huge has led Monica to believe...

194
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:27,970
<10-29,Ross>我们喧宾夺主了  我们才没有
<10-29,Ross>...we're stealing her thunder, which we aren't.

195
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:30,100
<10-30,Monica>我们还在聊这个  不是吗
<10-30,Monica>We're still talking about it, aren't we?

196
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,780
<10-31,Phoebe>那可不是钱德勒的错
<10-31,Phoebe>That ain't Chandler's problem.

197
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,010
<10-32,Joey>莫妮卡  听我说
<10-32,Joey>Monica, listen, listen.

198
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,590
<10-32,Joey>如果我们不再讨论
<10-32,Joey>Would you feel better

199
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,880
<10-32,Joey>瑞秋和罗斯的事  会不会让你好受一点
<10-32,Joey>if we stopped talking about Ross and Rachel?

200
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,990
<10-33,Monica>-那样就好了  -没问题
<10-33,Monica>- That would be lovely. - You got it.

201
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:45,190
<10-34,Joey>我绝对能演十九岁的  对吧
<10-34,Joey>Now, I can pass for 19, right?

202
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:47,350
<10-35,Chandler>对  你绝对能演十九岁的
<10-35,Chandler>Yes, you can pass for 19.

203
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,050
<10-36,Joey>-真的吗  -对
<10-36,Joey>- Really? - Yes.

204
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:51,330
<10-38,Joey>-认真的吗  -要听真心话
<10-38,Joey>- Seriously? - Seriously?

205
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:56,530
<10-39,Chandler>真心话就是  不行你只能演你自己年龄  31岁
<10-39,Chandler>Seriously, no. Okay? You can play your own age, which is 31.

206
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,340
<10-40,Joey>我才30
<10-40,Joey>I'm 30!

207
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,970
<10-41,Rachel>乔伊  你不是  你31了
<10-41,Rachel>Joey, you are not. You're 31.

208
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,880
<10-42,Joey>糟糕
<10-42,Joey>Oh, crap!

209
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:11,160
<10-43,Phoebe>去广场吧  吃泰国菜如何
<10-43,Phoebe>So the Plaza. We'll get some Mai Tais?

210
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:13,310
<10-43,Phoebe>你就不应该再吃辣了
<10-43,Phoebe>Maybe no more for you though.

211
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,590
<10-44,Monica>我不想去广场了
<10-44,Monica>You know, I think I don't feel like going to the Plaza.

212
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:21,560
<10-46,Rachel>莫妮卡  这太荒谬了
<10-46,Rachel>Monica, this is ridiculous.

213
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:25,930
<10-47,Monica>我不想谈  特别是和你
<10-47,Monica>I don't want to talk about it. I don't. Especially with you.

214
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,500
<10-48,Joey>太逊了
<10-48,Joey>That is whack.

215
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,580
<10-49,Phoebe>我要在婚礼上演奏
<10-49,Phoebe>I'll play it at the wedding.

216
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:49,220
<10-50,Joey>到时候再看吧
<10-50,Joey>We'll see if they actually let you play.

217
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,820
<10-50,Joey>他们总是先说些你喜欢听的
<10-50,Joey>They tell you anything you want to hear...

218
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,720
<10-50,Joey>就好像"你看上去像19岁"
<10-50,Joey>...like, "You look 19."

219
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:57,630
<10-50,Joey>然后他们再夺走这一切  说"其实没有"
<10-50,Joey>Then they just take it away, like, "No, you don't."

220
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,070
<10-51,Phoebe>莫妮卡不会这么对我的
<10-51,Phoebe>Monica won't take this away.

221
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:04,030
<10-53,Phoebe>-她不会吗  -她会吗
<10-53,Phoebe>- Wouldn't she? - Would she?

222
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:06,210
<10-53,Phoebe>她会吗
<10-53,Phoebe>Would she?

223
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:18,810
<11-1,Ross>猜猜是谁
<11-1,Ross>Guess who.

224
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:25,020
<11-3,Ross>我们还有些悬而未决的事情
<11-3,Ross>Hey, I just realized we kind of left some stuff up in the air.

225
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,690
<11-6,Rachel>莫妮卡说
<11-6,Rachel>What did Monica mean by

226
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,050
<11-4,Rachel>"我不想谈"  特别是和我  是什么意思
<11-4,Rachel>"I don't want to talk," especially with me?

227
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:32,260
<11-4,Rachel>为什么不是你和我  我们俩都在接吻
<11-4,Rachel>Why not especially you and me? We were both out there kissing.

228
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:33,720
<11-5,Ross>还想这个呢
<11-5,Ross>Still thinking about it?

229
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:37,420
<11-6,Rachel>我认真的  她说"特别是你"是什么意思
<11-6,Rachel>I'm serious. What did she mean by that? "Especially you."

230
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:39,600
<11-7,Ross>-谁在乎啊  -我在乎
<11-7,Ross>- Who cares? - I care.

231
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,240
<11-9,Ross>我也在乎
<11-9,Ross>And so do I.

232
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:48,240
<11-10,Rachel>我必须得和她谈谈  你能让我把衣服换了吗
<11-10,Rachel>I have to talk to her. Will you let me get changed?

233
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,870
<11-10,Rachel>我邀你观赏我更衣了吗
<11-10,Rachel>Am I going to let you watch me undressed?

234
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,210
<11-10,Rachel>没
<11-10,Rachel>No.

235
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:59,620
<12-1,Monica>简直不敢相信  她这太明显了
<12-1,Monica>I can't believe her. It's just so typical.

236
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:01,140
<12-1,Monica>我知道你生气
<12-1,Monica>I know you're upset,

237
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:04,160
<12-2,Chandler>但别忘了  你还会有婚礼
<12-2,Chandler>but don't forget there is going to be a wedding.

238
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:08,460
<12-2,Chandler>你要扔花球  还有蜜月呢
<12-2,Chandler>You are going to throw the bouquet, and then a honeymoon.

239
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:12,130
<12-3,Monica>-也许去巴黎  -巴黎
<12-3,Monica>- Maybe in Paris. - Paris?

240
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:19,970
<12-4,Chandler>我们也许会在啥啥啥大道上月下漫步
<12-4,Chandler>We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la blah-blah-blah.

241
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,300
<12-5,Monica>继续说
<12-5,Monica>Keep talking.

242
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:24,640
<12-6,Chandler>我们可以在洒满玫瑰花瓣的大床上做爱
<12-6,Chandler>We will sprinkle rose petals on the bed and make love...

243
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,080
<12-6,Chandler>不仅是因为这很浪漫  更因为我能
<12-6,Chandler>...not just because it's romantic, but because I can.

244
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,280
<12-7,Monica>我爱你
<12-7,Monica>I love you.

245
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,440
<12-8,Monica>你好  先生
<12-8,Monica>Bonjour monsieur.

246
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:45,900
<12-9,Chandler>什么都别说  把小兄弟吓跑了就不好了
<12-9,Chandler>Don't say anything, you might scare it away.

247
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:50,900
<12-10,Chandler>这可是巴黎  谁知道我们在巴黎
<12-10,Chandler>It's Paris. Who knows we're here?

248
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,170
<12-11,Monica>菲比  怎么了
<12-11,Monica>Hi, Pheebs. What's up?

249
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:59,850
<12-12,Phoebe>你说我能在你婚礼上献唱  我得要点订金
<12-12,Phoebe>You said I could sing at your wedding, so I need a small deposit.

250
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:04,680
<12-14,Phoebe>给点小钱  让我好空出档期
<12-14,Phoebe>You know, some good-faith money to hold the date.

251
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,120
<12-15,Chandler>我才不要给你订金
<12-15,Chandler>We're not giving you a deposit for our wedding.

252
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:10,060
<12-16,Phoebe>我懂了
<12-16,Phoebe>Oh, I see.

253
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:14,020
<13-1,Joey>他们伤了你的心  对吧
<13-1,Joey>They break your heart, don't they?

254
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:18,170
<13-2,Phoebe>我不需要他们的同意
<13-2,Phoebe>You know, I don't really need their permission.

255
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:21,430
<13-3,Joey>你想在他们婚礼上唱歌  就去吧
<13-3,Joey>You want to sing at their wedding, sing at their wedding.

256
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,440
<13-4,Phoebe>如果你想看起来像19岁  你就
<13-4,Phoebe>Yeah, and if you want to look 19, then you...

257
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,240
<13-4,Phoebe>你得整一下你的眼睛
<13-4,Phoebe>You got to do something about your eyes.

258
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,240
<13-5,Joey>我的眼睛怎么了
<13-5,Joey>What's wrong with my eyes?

259
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,810
<13-6,Phoebe>它们出卖了你  太智慧
<13-6,Phoebe>They give you away. There's too much wisdom in there.

260
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,380
<13-6,Phoebe>拿茶袋敷15分钟
<13-6,Phoebe>Put some tea bags on them for 15 minutes.

261
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:43,030
<13-7,Joey>-茶袋会掩盖我的智慧吗  -敷十分钟就好
<13-7,Joey>- That'll get rid of my wisdom. - Maybe 10 minutes for you.

262
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:49,060
<13-8,Phoebe>把订金给她  戒指也给她  我不在乎
<13-8,Phoebe>Give her the deposit, give her the ring. I don't care.

263
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,860
<13-10,Monica>-什么事  -你什么意思  当你说
<13-10,Monica>-Yes? -Monica,what did you mean when you said...

264
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:58,900
<13-11,Rachel>你不想谈  特别是和我
<13-11,Rachel>...you didn't want to talk to anyone, especially me?

265
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:03,710
<13-12,Chandler>这道歉真棒  而你也接受了  再见
<13-12,Chandler>What a great apology. And you accept. Bye-bye.

266
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:08,540
<13-13,Rachel>认真的  那"特别是和我"是为什么
<13-13,Rachel>No, seriously, what was the "Especially me" part about?

267
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:12,420
<13-14,Monica>这不是你第一次喧宾夺主了
<13-14,Monica>Let's just say it's not the first time you've stolen my thunder.

268
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,720
<13-16,Ross>我这么想
<13-16,Ross>Hey, here's a thought...

269
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,360
<13-17,Rachel>莫妮卡  你说什么呢
<13-17,Rachel>Monica, what are you talking about?

270
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,730
<13-18,Monica>我16岁生日  你和我表哥上了三垒
<13-18,Monica>My sweet 16. You went to third base with my cousin Charlie.

271
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:23,900
<13-19,Chandler>三垒啊
<13-19,Chandler>Third base.

272
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,430
<13-20,Monica>每个人都在讨论这事儿
<13-20,Monica>It was all everybody could talk about.

273
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:31,630
<13-21,Rachel>我那么做只不过因为你的派对太无聊了
<13-21,Rachel>Monica, you know what? The only reason I did that was because your party was so boring.

274
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,270
<13-22,Monica>我们请了一个漫画家
<13-22,Monica>We had a caricaturist.

275
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:40,910
<13-23,Rachel>要是我结婚  猜猜谁不会被请来献唱
<13-23,Rachel>Whenever I get married Guess who won't be asked to sing

276
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:45,590
<13-24,Phoebe>姓盖勒的和姓宾的
<13-24,Phoebe>Somebody named Geller And somebody else named Bing

277
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:52,950
<13-25,Rachel>莫妮卡  你的16岁生日已经是一百万年以前的事了
<13-25,Rachel>Monica, your sweet 16 was like a million years ago.

278
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,930
<13-26,Monica>你今天不是又来了一回吗
<13-26,Monica>Yet here you are doing it again.

279
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:57,460
<13-27,Rachel>我才不想喧宾夺什么主
<13-27,Rachel>I don't want to steal your stupid thunder.

280
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:00,570
<13-28,Monica>那你为什么要和罗斯亲热
<13-28,Monica>Why else would you have made out with Ross?

281
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:02,470
<13-29,Ross>可是抓住我了
<13-29,Ross>Got me.

282
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:07,900
<13-30,Rachel>别想了  那一瞬的感觉已经没了  不可能了
<13-30,Rachel>Easy, Mimey, the moment has passed. It ain't gonna happen.

283
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:11,740
<13-31,Monica>如果今夜能只属于我  就好了  就这一晚
<13-31,Monica>It'd be nice if I could have just this one night.

284
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:14,140
<13-32,Rachel>我才不想在你的夜晚中分一杯羹
<13-32,Rachel>I never wanted any part of your night.

285
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:15,940
<13-32,Rachel>大家都不应该看见我们接吻的
<13-32,Rachel>No one was supposed to see us kissing.

286
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:17,510
<13-33,Monica>所以你们才在僻静的小走道上接吻
<13-33,Monica>Is that why you did it

287
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:19,850
<13-33,Monica>因为永远都不会有人看见
<13-33,Monica>in the secret hallway, where nobody ever goes?

288
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:23,290
<13-34,Ross>瑞秋  我一直在考虑
<13-34,Ross>Rachel, I've been thinking.

289
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:27,830
<13-34,Ross>我不觉得我们俩今晚一夜风流会是个好主意
<13-34,Ross>I don't think us getting together tonight is such a good idea.

290
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,190
<13-34,Ross>我不干了
<13-34,Ross>I'm calling it off.

291
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,970
<13-35,Chandler>挽回面子的好方法啊  伙计
<13-35,Chandler>Way to save your dignity, my man.

292
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:39,970
<13-36,Rachel>莫妮卡  我为什么会想要喧宾夺主呢
<13-36,Rachel>Mon, why, why would I ever want to take away from your night?

293
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:42,770
<13-37,Monica>也许你就是有点不高兴
<13-37,Monica>I don't know, maybe you feel a little resentful.

294
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:45,640
<13-37,Monica>也许你以为你会先结婚
<13-37,Monica>Maybe you thought you'd get married first.

295
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,110
<13-37,Monica>也许你就是无法忍受
<13-37,Monica>Maybe you can't stand...

296
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:50,510
<13-37,Monica>你那个以前很胖的朋友会先结婚
<13-37,Monica>...that your formerly fat friend is getting married before you.

297
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,090
<13-38,Rachel>这太不公平了
<13-38,Rachel>Oh, wow, that... You know what? That is so unfair.

298
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:57,350
<13-38,Rachel>现在我想要喧宾夺主了
<13-38,Rachel>Now I want to steal your thunder.

299
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:00,220
<13-38,Rachel>走罗斯  做爱去
<13-38,Rachel>Come on, Ross. Let's go have sex!

300
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:13,370
<13-39,Monica>我简直不敢相信你们竟然要在我的订婚夜做爱
<13-39,Monica>I can't believe you're gonna have sex on my engagement night.

301
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,310
<13-40,Chandler>总得有人做
<13-40,Chandler>Well, somebody should.

302
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,380
<14-1,Ross>如果我们要做
<14-1,Ross>Look, if we're gonna do this...

303
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:23,180
<14-2,Rachel>我们没有要做  只是让她以为我们做了
<14-2,Rachel>We're not gonna do this. She's just gonna think we are.

304
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:25,620
<14-3,Ross>好吧  多赢
<14-3,Ross>I see, so everybody wins.

305
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,120
<14-5,Monica>-谁啊  -莫妮卡  开门
<14-5,Monica>- Who is it? - It's Monica, open up.

306
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:33,820
<14-6,Rachel>罗斯  停一下拜托  等一下
<14-6,Rachel>Okay, Ross, stop it. Please, wait a minute.

307
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:39,430
<14-8,Rachel>你喜欢这样对吧  宝贝
<14-8,Rachel>Yeah, you like that, baby?

308
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:44,370
<14-8,Rachel>我们能帮到你吗
<14-8,Rachel>May we help you?

309
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,360
<14-9,Monica>我要告诉你我希望你们俩今晚做爱
<14-9,Monica>I wanted to say I hope you do have sex tonight,

310
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:49,500
<14-9,Monica>我也希望你们复合
<14-9,Monica>and I hope you get back together.

311
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:52,770
<14-9,Monica>我警告你  你要宣布订婚当晚
<14-9,Monica>I warn you, the night you announce your engagement...

312
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:55,280
<14-9,Monica>我要宣布我怀孕了
<14-9,Monica>...l'm going to announce that I'm pregnant.

313
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:58,850
<14-10,Chandler>那怎么可能呢
<14-10,Chandler>How is that ever going to happen?

314
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:02,050
<14-11,Rachel>你想知道今晚我为什么会和罗斯在一起吗
<14-11,Rachel>Do you want to know why I was with Ross tonight?

315
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:03,590
<14-12,Monica>-我知道  -你才不
<14-12,Monica>- I know why. - You don't.

316
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:06,960
<14-15,Rachel>-好吧  为什么  -因为我很伤心
<14-15,Rachel>- Okay, why? - Because I was sad.

317
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,660
<14-16,Monica>什么意思
<14-16,Monica>What do you mean?

318
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,970
<14-16,Monica>听着  我非常
<14-16,Monica>Look, I am so...

319
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,540
<14-17,Rachel>非常为你们高兴
<14-17,Rachel>...so happy for you guys.

320
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:19,540
<14-17,Rachel>但你要结婚这件事提醒了我  我没有要结婚
<14-17,Rachel>But you getting married reminds me of the fact that I'm not.

321
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,240
<14-17,Rachel>我八字还没一撇呢
<14-17,Rachel>I'm not even close.

322
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,570
<14-17,Rachel>许我只想让自己好过一点
<14-17,Rachel>Maybe I just wanted to make myself feel better.

323
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:27,880
<14-17,Rachel>我知道这很蠢  但是罗斯结婚的时候
<14-17,Rachel>I know that that's dumb, but you were so depressed...

324
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,590
<14-17,Rachel>你太沮丧  以至于跑去和钱德勒睡了
<14-17,Rachel>...when Ross got married, you slept with Chandler.

325
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:34,920
<14-18,Chandler>我无所谓  和她睡的是我
<14-18,Chandler>I don't care, she slept with me.

326
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:40,990
<14-19,Rachel>甜心  很抱歉我毁了专属你的今晚
<14-19,Rachel>Anyway, sweetie, I am so sorry I ruined your night.

327
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:45,760
<14-20,Monica>我很抱歉让你几乎和罗斯上床
<14-20,Monica>I'm sorry I almost made you sleep with Ross.

328
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:53,230
<14-21,Ross>我要走了
<14-21,Ross>I'm gonna take off.

<14-23,Ross>And Rachel...

331
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,310
<14-24,Rachel>我能说什么呢
<14-24,Rachel>...what can I say?

332
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,320
<14-25,Ross>你错过了你的机会
<14-25,Ross>You missed your chance.

333
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:05,220
<14-25,Ross>从现在起
<14-25,Ross>From now on, the only

334
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:08,720
<14-25,Ross>能享受这对魔术之手的  就只有我了
<14-25,Ross>person who's gonna enjoy these bad boys is me.

335
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:21,110
<14-25,Ross>我们以为菲比会离开
<14-25,Ross>We thought Phoebe would leave

336
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:23,950
<14-25,Ross>但是她却留了下来
<14-25,Ross>But she just stayed and stayed

337
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,450
<14-25,Ross>没错  我彻夜在此
<14-25,Ross>That's right, I'm here all night

338
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,240
<15-1,Phoebe>钱德勒会永远无法
<15-1,Phoebe>And Chandler will never get...

00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:31,050
<15-2,Chandler>给你一美元
<15-2,Chandler>Hey, here's a dollar.

<15-2,Chandler>Consider it a deposit. Please sing at our wedding.

341
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:36,090
<15-3,Phoebe>谢谢
<15-3,Phoebe>Thank you.

342
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:40,430
<15-5,Phoebe>谁要在婚礼上献唱
<15-5,Phoebe>Now who will perform the ceremony

343
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:43,690
<15-5,Phoebe>谁要在婚礼上献
