<3-13,Erica>再过两个星期我就不能坐飞机了
<3-13,Erica>In a couple weeks I won't be able to travel.

77
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,760
<3-14,Monica>我想让她先见见医生
<3-14,Monica>And I wanted her to get to know the doctors

78
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,550
<3-14,Monica>然后在酒店安顿下来
<3-14,Monica>and get settled into the hotel.

79
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:16,540
<3-15,Ross>酒店  为什么不让她和你们一起住
<3-15,Ross>Why isn't she staying with you guys?

80
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,900
<3-16,Monica>因为我们马上就要搬了
<3-16,Monica>Because we're moving in a couple days

81
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,130
<3-16,Monica>这样不行啊
<3-16,Monica>and it just didn't make sense.

00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:20,490
<3-17,Erica>酒店里很好玩儿啊
<3-17,Erica>Plus, hotels are fun!

83
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:21,720
<3-17,Erica>我的房间里有个小冰柜里面塞满了零食
<3-17,Erica>My room has this little fridge

84
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,590
<3-17,Erica>都是免费的

85
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,620
<3-18,Ross>艾瑞卡  那些零食可不是免费的
<3-18,Ross>Erica, those things aren't free.

86
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:30,060
<3-18,Ross>实际上  酒店里的食品是最贵...
<3-18,Ross>They have one of the highest markups of any consumer product--

87
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,850
<3-19,Monica>罗斯  她正准备给我们生个孩子

00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:34,240
<3-19,Monica>就算她把你吃了都无所谓
<3-19,Monica>She can eat you if she wants.

89
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,320
<3-19,Monica>我马上就回来
<3-19,Monica>I'll be right back.

90
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:42,990
<3-20,Ross>真不敢相信你们就要离开这儿了
<3-20,Ross>Oh, man, I can't believe you guys are leaving this place.

91
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,620
<3-20,Ross>是啊...

<3-21,Monica>如果你想要这间公寓的话
<3-21,Monica>You know, you could take it if you want.

93
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:49,350
<3-21,Monica>你可以住进来  租约还是奶奶的名字
<3-21,Monica>The lease is still in Nana's name.

<3-22,Ross>哦  不  不  这里永远是属于你们的
<3-22,Ross>No, no. This will always be your place.

95
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,250
<3-22,Ross>住在这儿太伤感了
<3-22,Ross>It would be too sad.

<4-14,Joey>也许是理查德呢
<4-14,Joey>Maybe Richard.

135
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,180
<4-15,Chandler>为什么她和理查德玩儿这个  却不跟我玩儿
<4-15,Chandler>Why would she use them with Richard and not me?

136
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,010
<4-15,Chandler>我也有怪癖啊
<4-15,Chandler>I can be kinky.

137
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:49,670
<4-15,Chandler>有一次我还光着身子给她跳舞来着
<4-15,Chandler>I once did a naked dance

138
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,910
<4-15,Chandler>当时我用的是领带
<4-15,Chandler>for her with scarves.

139
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:56,770
<4-16,Ross>越来越过分了...
<4-16,Ross>Bumming hard, guys. Bumming hard.

140
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:05,500
<5-2,Monica>-嘿  -嗨  迈克呢
<5-2,Monica>- Hey. - Hey. Where's Mike?

141
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,860
<5-3,Phoebe>他有一场演出...
<5-3,Phoebe>Oh, he has a gig.

142
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,860
<5-3,Phoebe>我越来越觉得自己
<5-3,Phoebe>It's kind of like being married

143
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,860
<5-3,Phoebe>像是个摇滚歌星的老婆了...
<5-3,Phoebe>to a rock star, you know?

144
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,840
<5-3,Phoebe>我老公有场演出
<5-3,Phoebe>My husband has a gig.

145
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,630
<5-4,Ross>在哪儿演出啊
<5-4,Ross>Yeah? Where is it?

146
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:15,940
<5-5,Phoebe>是一个少儿滑旱冰的聚会
<5-5,Phoebe>Oh, he's playing organ

147
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:18,820
<5-5,Phoebe>他去那儿弹琴
<5-5,Phoebe>for a children's roller-skating party.

148
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,720
<5-6,Ross>还真够劲儿啊
<5-6,Ross>Rock on!

149
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,200
<5-6,Ross>摆了这么大一桌子
<5-6,Ross>Wow, this is quite a spread.

150
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,520
<5-7,Monica>这些都是什么啊
<5-7,Monica>What is all this stuff?

151
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,920
<5-7,Monica>我觉得今天的晚会是一个好机会
<5-7,Monica>I thought this would be a great opportunity to use up all the food...

152
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:32,020
<5-7,Monica>我可以把所有不想带走的食物全都用了
<5-7,Monica>...that I don't want to move to the new house with me.

153
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:34,210
<5-7,Monica>那么尽情享受吧
<5-7,Monica>So enjoy.

154
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:38,470
<5-7,Monica>熏牡蛎卷拌早餐麦片
<5-7,Monica>Smoked oyster casserole with a breakfast-cereal crust.

155
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,170
<5-7,Monica>四季豆加豆汁儿
<5-7,Monica>Kidney beans in their own juices,

156
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:45,070
<5-7,Monica>然后甜点是...一个疑似过期的橙子
<5-7,Monica>and for dessert, a questionable orange.

157
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,480
<5-10,Ross>嘿  瑞秋呢
<5-10,Ross>Where's Rach?

158
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:49,960
<5-11,Joey>她在哄艾玛睡觉呢
<5-11,Joey>She's putting Emma down.

00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,760
<5-11,Joey>马上就过来
<5-11,Joey>She'll be over in a second.

160
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,440
<5-13,Joey>可能是因为要走了
<5-13,Joey>It just hit her that she's leaving.

161
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,910
<5-13,Joey>她现在情绪有点激动
<5-13,Joey>She's kind of emotional,

162
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:56,870
<5-13,Joey>所以别刺激她  记住了么
<5-13,Joey>so no one say anything to set her off, okay?

<5-20,Ross>天呐  我真不敢相信  她真的要走了
<5-20,Ross>Oh, man, I can't believe she's actually leaving.

170
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:20,520
<5-20,Ross>让我怎么开得了口说再见啊
<5-20,Ross>How am I gonna say goodbye to Rachel?

171
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,860
<5-21,Chandler>她对我来说这么重要...就好像
<5-21,Chandler>I know, she's been such a big part of my life.

172
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:26,220
<5-21,Chandler>就好像《飞跃情海》被砍了一样
<5-21,Chandler>It feels like when Melrose Place got cancelled.

173
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,570
<5-21,Chandler>我是说..
<5-21,Chandler>I mean....

174
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:35,390
<5-21,Chandler>不解释  我想念《飞跃情海》
<5-21,Chandler>Forget it, I miss Melrose Place.

<5-22,Ross>-我本来有机会阻止她的  -是吗
<5-22,Ross>- I had a chance to stop her too. - Yeah?

176

<5-23,Joey>Who loses 57 coin tosses in a row? You know?

177
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,060
<5-23,Joey>正面她赢  反面我输
<5-23,Joey>Heads, she wins. Tails, I lose.

<5-23,Joey>等等...

<5-25,Joey>我忘了把衣服从干洗店拿回来了
<5-25,Joey>I forgot to pick up my dry cleaning.

<5-29,Phoebe>当然了
<5-29,Phoebe>Yes! You know,

185
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,410
<5-29,Phoebe>再过6个月我的禁令就过期了
<5-29,Phoebe>in six months, the statute of limitations runs out...

186
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:12,820
<5-29,Phoebe>到时候我又可以作国际旅行了
<5-29,Phoebe>...and I can travel internationally again.

187
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:18,050
<5-30,Rachel>-我一定会很想你的   -我也是
<5-30,Rachel>- I'm gonna miss you so much. - I know.

00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:20,410
<5-31,Phoebe>你知道么
<5-31,Phoebe>You know what?

189
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:22,550
<5-32,Rachel>我对你们每个人都有些告别的话要说
<5-32,Rachel>I have some goodbye stuff that I wanted to say...

190
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:25,610
<5-32,Rachel>我本来打算在结束的时候说的
<5-32,Rachel>...to each of you. I was gonna save it till the end of the night,

191
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:27,100
<5-19,Monica>但是...跟我来

<5-33,Ross>Hey, what do you think they're doing in there?

193
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,520
<5-34,Joey>嗯  照我看来
<5-34,Joey>If I had to guess, I'd say...

194
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:35,960
<5-34,Joey>肯定是瑞秋戴上塑料泡沫
<5-34,Joey>...Rachel's putting on the bubble wrap,

195
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,000
<5-34,Joey>然后菲比来动手打
<5-34,Joey>and Phoebe's doing the punching.

196
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,250
<6-1,Rachel>哦  菲比  我真不知道应该怎么开口
<6-1,Rachel>Pheebs, I don't even know where to start.

197
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,210
<6-2,Phoebe>嗯  这样吧
<6-2,Phoebe>Okay, well, before you do,

198
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,380
<6-2,Phoebe>我知道今天本来不需要给你准备礼物的
<6-2,Phoebe>I know we weren't supposed to get you presents...

199
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,990
<6-2,Phoebe>但我还是准备了一个
<6-2,Phoebe>...but I do have something for you.

200
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,490
<6-3,Rachel>哦  哦  这是什么
<6-3,Rachel>What is it?

201
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:56,020
<6-4,Phoebe>是一个棉花棒
<6-4,Phoebe>Well, it's a cotton swab...

202
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:58,600
<6-4,Phoebe>上面沾了些我的唾液
<6-4,Phoebe>...with a bit of my saliva on it...

203
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:02,670
<6-4,Phoebe>这样一来 如果你在巴黎的时候
<6-4,Phoebe>...so that if they perfect the cloning process

204
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:03,450
<6-4,Phoebe>发现那边的克隆技术成熟了
<6-4,Phoebe>while you're over there...

205
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:04,750
<6-4,Phoebe>你就可以用这上面的DNA
<6-4,Phoebe>...you can use the DNA

206
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,840
<6-4,Phoebe>来另外做一个菲比
<6-4,Phoebe>to create your own Pheebs.

207
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:13,020
<6-5,Rachel>我可能会把这个扔掉...
<6-5,Rachel>I'm gonna throw this away...

208
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:17,900
<6-5,Rachel>但是我很感谢你这份心意...
<6-5,Rachel>...but thank you so much for the gesture.

209
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:20,930
<6-5,Rachel>钱德勒
<6-5,Rachel>Chandler?

210
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:26,060
<7-1,Monica>我刚才在卧室的枕头上发现了这个
<7-1,Monica>I was just in our bedroom, and I found these on my pillow.

211
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,090
<7-2,Chandler>哦  我决定把这个先给你留着
<7-2,Chandler>Oh, yes, I decided to leave those out for you

212
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:29,390
<7-2,Chandler>万一哪天理查德过来
<7-2,Chandler>in case Richard stops by...

213
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:33,510
<7-2,Chandler>你可以跟他的胡子一起玩
<7-2,Chandler>...and you want to engage in a little light bondage and mustache play.

214
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:37,110
<7-3,Monica>你说什么呢  这不是我的
<7-3,Monica>What? These aren't mine.

215
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,580
<7-4,Chandler>啊  是吗
<7-4,Chandler>Oh, yeah, right!

216
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:41,550
<7-4,Chandler>以后休想再让我给你跳领带舞了
<7-4,Chandler>Good luck getting another scarf dance from me.

217
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:45,700
<7-5,Monica>这种"惩罚"太可怕了
<7-5,Monica>That would be a terrible punishment.

218
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:47,640
<7-5,Monica>我是说真的
<7-5,Monica>But I'm serious,

219
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,940
<7-5,Monica>我以前从来没见过这东西
<7-5,Monica>I've never seen these before.

220
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,100
<7-5,Monica>真的吗
<7-5,Monica>Really?

221
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,490
<7-6,Chandler>那它怎么会出现在我们的客房里的
<7-6,Chandler>Then what are they doing in our guest room?

222
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:54,490
<7-7,Monica>瑞秋曾经在那里住过
<7-7,Monica>Rachel used to live in that room.

223
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:58,030
<7-8,Chandler>瑞秋...  戴着手铐...
<7-8,Chandler>Rachel. With handcuffs.

224
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,780
<7-8,Chandler>有意思
<7-8,Chandler>Interesting.

225
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,750
<7-9,Monica>光着屁股的乔伊
<7-9,Monica>Joey's bare ass.

226
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,870
<7-10,Chandler>真有你的
<7-10,Chandler>Well played.

227
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:16,480
<7-11,Rachel>-我爱你  菲比  -我也爱你
<7-11,Rachel>- I love you, Phoebe. - I love you too.

228
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:20,720
<7-12,Phoebe>你..
<7-12,Phoebe>Please....

229
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,180
<7-12,Phoebe>你可千万...
<7-12,Phoebe>Please don't--

230
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:25,760
<7-12,Phoebe>别变成一个...法国婊子
<7-12,Phoebe>Don't turn into, you know, a French bitch.

231
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,450
<7-12,Phoebe>好的
<7-12,Phoebe>I won't.

232
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:32,080
<7-13,Rachel>如果我想一个一个告别
<7-13,Rachel>All right. Well, if I'm gonna do this,

233
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,140
<7-13,Rachel>我得继续找其他人了
<7-13,Rachel>I better keep going.

234
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,600
<7-14,Phoebe>-好的  -好的
<7-14,Phoebe>- Okay. - Okay.

236
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,790
<7-17,Rachel>-跟我进来一下好吗  -当然
<7-17,Rachel>- Will you come with me for a minute? - Sure.

237
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:42,950
<7-19,Phoebe>-你的睫毛膏是防水的么   -不是啊
<7-19,Phoebe>- Are you wearing waterproof mascara? - No.

238
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,910
<7-21,Phoebe>哦  你完蛋了
<7-21,Phoebe>Oh, you're so screwed.

239
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:52,040
<7-21,Phoebe>嘿
<7-21,Phoebe>Hey.

240
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,000
<7-22,Ross>这是怎么回事
<7-22,Ross>What was that all about?

241
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,140
<7-23,Phoebe>她打算跟
<7-23,Phoebe>She's gonna say goodbye

242
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,500
<7-23,Phoebe>我们每个人单独告别
<7-23,Phoebe>to each of us individually.

243
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:00,150
<7-24,Ross>开什么玩笑  天呐
<7-24,Ross>Are you kidding? Oh, my God.

244
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:00,910
<7-25,Phoebe>是啊  我知道
<7-25,Phoebe>Yeah, I know.

245
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,820
<7-25,Phoebe>轮到你的时候可能会更糟
<7-25,Phoebe>It's gonna be even worse for you. God.

246
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:07,090
<7-25,Phoebe>天呐  准备好好大哭一场吧
<7-25,Phoebe>Well, just get ready to do some serious crying.

247
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:09,620
<7-26,Ross>天呐  我怕我会撑不过去
<7-26,Ross>Man, I'm not gonna be able to handle this.

248
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,840
<7-26,Ross>我现在终于知道
<7-26,Ross>Now I know how my students feel

249
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,930
<7-26,Ross>每个学期末我的学生们的感受了
<7-26,Ross>at the end of each year.

250
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,560
<7-26,Ross>我猜他们是因为太舍不得我了
<7-26,Ross>And why they act out

251
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:21,000
<7-26,Ross>所以才会在评定时给我打那么低的分数
<7-26,Ross>by giving me such bad evaluations.

252
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:27,110
<8-1,Rachel>莫妮卡  好吧
<8-1,Rachel>Mon. Okay.

253
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,800
<8-1,Rachel>我就直说了  我想说的是...
<8-1,Rachel>I better just say what it is I'm gonna say.

254
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,750
<8-1,Rachel>如果没有你
<8-1,Rachel>None of the amazing things

255
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,430
<8-1,Rachel>我在过去十年里
<8-1,Rachel>that have happened to me in the last 10 years...

256
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:42,060
<8-1,Rachel>我不可能会这么幸福
<8-1,Rachel>...would have happened if it wasn't for you.

257
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:48,160
<8-1,Rachel>一直以来  你对我来说就像是姐妹一样
<8-1,Rachel>No one has been more like a sister to me.

258
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:50,360
<8-2,Monica>我知道你的意思
<8-2,Monica>I know what you mean.

259
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:53,240
<8-2,Monica>我也一直把你当作姐妹
<8-2,Monica>You're like a sister to me too.

260
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,420
<8-3,Rachel>我不知道没有你我会怎么办
<8-3,Rachel>I don't know what I'm going to do without you.

261
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,790
<8-4,Monica>你是我做好的朋友
<8-4,Monica>You're the greatest friend I ever had.

262
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,890
<8-5,Rachel>...每天见到你
<8-5,Rachel>--Seeing you every day.

263
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,220
<8-6,Monica>你说什么
<8-6,Monica>What?

264
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,960
<8-7,Rachel>我...
<8-7,Rachel>I--

265
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,370
<8-7,Rachel>每天都看见你
<8-7,Rachel>--see you every day!

266
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:23,050
<8-8,Monica>太让我感动了
<8-8,Monica>That is so sweet!

267
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:32,270
<9-1,Ross>她已经搞掂莫妮卡了
<9-1,Ross>Oh, no, she took down Monica.

268
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:36,160
<9-1,Ross>要知道在盖勒家我是最爱哭的
<9-1,Ross>And I'm the crier in the family.

269
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,670
<9-1,Ross>天呐  可能该轮到我了
<9-1,Ross>Oh, God, I could be next.

270
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:40,670
<9-1,Ross>如果我跟你说话
<9-1,Ross>Maybe she won't talk to me

271
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:43,170
<9-1,Ross>她可能就不选我了
<9-1,Ross>if it looks like we're deep in conversation.

272
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:45,770
<9-1,Ross>哦  那么说你之前说的那个什么
<9-1,Ross>Oh, so that thing you said about the thing...

273
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:47,970
<9-4,Joey>让我想起了那个什么
<9-4,Joey>...it really made me think about that other thing.

274
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:49,250
<9-2,Chandler>瑞秋
<9-2,Chandler>Rach?

275
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,390
<9-3,Ross>好了  看起来钱德勒找上她了
<9-3,Ross>Oh, it's okay, Chandler's talking to her.

276
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:53,620
<9-4,Joey>你想起了哪个什么啊
<9-4,Joey>I really made you think about that thing, huh?

277
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:01,980
<9-5,Chandler>瑞秋  我想这个应该是你的吧
<9-5,Chandler>Rach, I think I have something that belongs to you.

278
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:09,610
<9-6,Rachel>你的笑话又来了  每次我都得逼着自己乐
<9-6,Rachel>I'm sure gonna miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes

279
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:11,440
<9-6,Rachel>我将来一定会怀念这种感觉
<9-6,Rachel>that I don't get.

280
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,810
<9-7,Chandler>不  不  这真的是你的
<9-7,Chandler>No, no, they're really yours.

281
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:16,770
<9-7,Chandler>我们是在你住过的房间里找到的
<9-7,Chandler>We found them in your old room.

282
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:18,120
<9-7,Chandler>但这不是我的啊
<9-7,Chandler>These aren't mine.

283
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,700
<9-8,Rachel>也许这是莫妮卡以前和...
<9-8,Rachel>Maybe Monica used to use them with--

284
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,190
<9-9,Chandler>别提理查德
<9-9,Chandler>Don't say Richard.

285
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,300
<9-9,Chandler>如果这不是莫妮卡的
<9-9,Chandler>Well, if they're not Monica's

286
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,210
<9-9,Chandler>也不是你的  那是谁的呢
<9-9,Chandler>and they're not yours, then whose are they?

287
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:27,460
<9-10,Rachel>我想你大概忘了
<9-10,Rachel>I think you're forgetting

288
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:30,570
<9-10,Rachel>在客房里住过的所有人里面  谁是最变态的
<9-10,Rachel>the kinkiest former resident of that room.

289
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:32,720
<9-11,Chandler>-菲比  -嗯
<9-11,Chandler>- Pheebs! - Yeah!

290
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,070
<9-13,Chandler>我想这个是你的吧
<9-13,Chandler>I think these are yours.

291
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:42,780
<9-14,Phoebe>这不是我的  稍微一使劲就坏了
<9-14,Phoebe>These are not mine. Look how flimsy they are. Come on.

292
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:47,470
<9-14,Phoebe>如果你用这个把人栓在水管上面
<9-14,Phoebe>My God, you try to hang a guy from a water pipe with these...

293
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:50,060
<9-14,Phoebe>一使劲就断掉了
<9-14,Phoebe>...they'll snap like a piece of licorice.

294
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:54,100
<9-15,Rachel>-我能单独跟你谈谈么  -当然
<9-15,Rachel>- Can I talk to you alone for a minute? - Sure.

295
00:13:57,390 --> 00:14:01,130
<9-16,Chandler>你不会真的把人拷在水管上吧
<9-16,Chandler>You don't really handcuff guys to water pipes do you?

296
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,920
<9-17,Phoebe>你以为迈克现在在哪儿
<9-17,Phoebe>Where do you think Mike really is?

297
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,770
<10-1,Rachel>哦  亲爱的
<10-1,Rachel>Oh, honey....

298
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,240
<10-1,Rachel>让我先说两句吧
<10-1,Rachel>Let me just saying something

299
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,530
<10-2,Chandler>要不然待会儿一旦我觉得不自然
<10-2,Chandler>because once we get into this...

300
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:18,850
<10-2,Chandler>我可能又该
<10-2,Chandler>...I'm gonna get all uncomfortable

301
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:21,530
<10-2,Chandler>开始开无聊的玩笑了
<10-2,Chandler>and probably make some stupid joke.

302
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:27,150
<10-2,Chandler>我就是想说  我...我爱你
<10-2,Chandler>I just want to say that l-- I love you.

303
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:30,950
<10-2,Chandler>还有就是  我会想你的
<10-2,Chandler>And I'm gonna miss you.

304
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:34,350
<10-2,Chandler>你就这么走了  我真的很难过
<10-2,Chandler>And I'm so sad that you're leaving.

305
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,180
<10-3,Rachel>你知道吗
<10-3,Rachel>Oh, you know what?

306
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:42,790
<10-3,Rachel>其它的什么也不用说了
<10-3,Rachel>Let's not say anything else.

307
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,590
<10-3,Rachel>我也爱你
<10-3,Rachel>I love you.

308
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,360
<10-4,Chandler>别抱的这么紧
<10-4,Chandler>Not so tight.

309
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:53,350
<10-4,Chandler>对不起  再给我一次机会
<10-4,Chandler>I'm sorry, give me one more chance.

310
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:53,960
<10-5,Rachel>好吧
<10-5,Rachel>Okay.

311
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,280
<10-6,Rachel>好吧
<10-6,Rachel>Okay.

312
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:01,320
<10-7,Chandler>走吧  走吧  我控制不了自己
<10-7,Chandler>I'm sorry. Just go. Just go. I can't. I can't.

313
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:09,500
<11-1,Monica>看来你是下一个了  准备好了没有
<11-1,Monica>So I guess you're next. You ready?

314
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:10,540
<11-2,Ross>还没有
<11-2,Ross>I don't think so.

315
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,220
<11-2,Ross>显然你没有
<11-2,Ross>Oh, you're definitely not.

316
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,240
<11-3,Chandler>我几年都没有这么哭过了
<11-3,Chandler>I haven't cried like that in years.

317
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,760
<11-4,Monica>昨天晚上你还对着六点钟的新闻哭来着
<11-4,Monica>You cried yesterday at the 6:00 news.

318
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:20,540
<11-5,Chandler>那个老太太被人骗得好惨
<11-5,Chandler>That old woman was being scammed by her mechanic.

319
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:24,950
<11-6,Ross>天呐  没想到她居然把我排在最后
<11-6,Ross>God, I can't believe she saved me for last.

320
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,790
<11-6,Ross>他们俩怎么还没说完
<11-6,Ross>Why are they taking so long?

321
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:27,530
<11-7,Phoebe>我也不知道
<11-7,Phoebe>I don't know.

322
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:31,220
<11-7,Phoebe>不过看起来乔伊好像没什么事儿一样  真是意外
<11-7,Phoebe>But, God, Joey seems to be handling it surprisingly well.

323
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:37,100
<11-8,All>-不  -不  乔伊
<11-8,All>- No! - No! Joey!

324
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,990
<11-9,Ross>好了  轮到我了
<11-9,Ross>Okay, here we go.

325
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:53,070
<11-11,Ross>-啊  好吧  -嗯
<11-11,Ross>- Well.... - Yeah.

326
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:56,200
<11-12,Rachel>我想我该走了
<11-12,Rachel>I think I'm gonna take off.

327
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:03,730
<11-12,Rachel>哦大伙  真是奇妙的夜晚啊
<11-12,Rachel>Oh, you guys, this was an amazing night.

328
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:05,340
<11-13,Ross>非常感谢
<11-13,Ross>Thank you so much.

329
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,900
<11-14,Rachel>我爱你们
<11-14,Rachel>I love you.

330
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:08,610
<11-14,Rachel>晚安
<11-14,Rachel>Good night.

331
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:14,360
<11-14,Rachel>什么
<11-14,Rachel>What?!

332
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:19,900
<11-14,Rachel>都不和我说再见的
<11-14,Rachel>I don't get a goodbye?

333
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,740
<11-14,Rachel>你这个幸运的混蛋
<11-14,Rachel>Lucky bastard.

334
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,700
<12-1,Ross>我简直不敢相信
<12-1,Ross>Unbelievable.

335
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,990
<12-1,Ross>她跟你们每个人告别  却不跟我说
<12-1,Ross>She says goodbye to everyone but me!

336
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:35,440
<12-2,Monica>也许她觉得你们这么多年的默契
<12-2,Monica>Well, maybe she thought that with all of your history,

337
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,690
<12-2,Monica>一切都...
<12-2,Monica>it could be...

338
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:38,030
<12-2,Monica>"尽在不言中"了呢
<12-2,Monica>...you know, implicit.

339
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,890
<12-3,Ross>那需要"言"的
<12-3,Ross>Well, it needs to be "plicit."

340
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:42,640
<12-4,Joey>我们好好想想
<12-4,Joey>All right, let's think about this.

341
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:44,650
<12-4,Joey>肯定是有什么原因的
<12-4,Joey>I mean, there's gotta be an explanation.

342
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:47,100
<12-4,Joey>你是不是惹她生气了
<12-4,Joey>Did you do anything to make her mad?

343
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,020
<12-5,Ross>没有啊
<12-5,Ross>No, I don't think so.

344
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:53,050
<12-6,Phoebe>你知道  也许她和我们讲话花费不少体力
<12-6,Phoebe>You know, maybe she was just really spent from our talk.

345
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:54,870
<12-7,Monica>-真是非常的热烈啊  -对啊  我的也是
<12-7,Monica>- It was pretty intense. - Yeah, mine too.

346
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:57,430
<12-8,Chandler>-我的也很猛烈  -好吧
<12-8,Chandler>- Mine was a humdinger. - Okay!

347
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,480
<12-9,Ross>我是说  我真的那么无足轻重吗
<12-9,Ross>I mean, don't I deserve anything?

348
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,910
<12-9,Ross>哪怕是几滴眼泪  一个简单的拥抱
<12-9,Ross>I mean, a few tears, a cursory hug?

349
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:08,480
<12-9,Ross>不是跟你抱
<12-9,Ross>Not from you!

350
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,130
<12-10,Phoebe>罗斯  如果你这么在意
<12-10,Phoebe>Ross, if you're this upset,

351
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,820
<12-10,Phoebe>你应该去跟她直说
<12-10,Phoebe>you should go and talk to her.

352
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:15,340
<12-11,Monica>说什么啊  说"你还没跟我告别呢"
<12-11,Monica>And say what? You owe me a goodbye?

353
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:17,500
<13-2,Joey>他的自尊心往哪儿放
<13-2,Joey>I mean, he's got more pride than that.

354
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,410
<12-12,Ross>什么自尊心  见鬼去吧
<12-12,Ross>The hell I do!

355
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,330
<12-14,Rachel>-连再见都不跟我说   -什么
<12-14,Rachel>- I don't get a goodbye? - What?

356
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:27,650
<12-15,Ross>你跟其他人都告过别了  为什么没有我
<12-15,Ross>Everyone gets a goodbye but me?

357
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:29,910
<12-15,Ross>到底要我做什么你才舍得跟我说句再见
<12-15,Ross>What do I gotta do to get a goodbye?

358
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:33,050
<12-15,Ross>做你最好的朋友  和你约会
<12-15,Ross>Be best friends with you? Go out with you?

359
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:34,480
<12-15,Ross>跟你生个孩子
<12-15,Ross>Have a baby with you?

360
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,310
<12-15,Ross>哦  等一下  等一下
<12-15,Ross>Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute!

361
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:37,310
<12-15,Ross>这些我好像都做过
<12-15,Ross>I did all those things!

362
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:38,940
<12-16,Rachel>罗斯...
<12-16,Rachel>Ross--

363
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,680
<12-17,Ross>哦  也许我应该
<12-17,Ross>Or maybe I'm just not giving you...

364
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,720
<12-17,Ross>体谅你一下
<12-17,Ross>...enough credit.

365
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:45,630
<12-17,Ross>也许连续跟五个人说再见是太困难了一点
<12-17,Ross>I mean, it is difficult to say goodbye to five people.

366
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:48,620
<12-17,Ross>再见  再见  再见  再见  再...
<12-17,Ross>Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, g--

367
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,800
<12-17,Ross>生理上是做不到的
<12-17,Ross>It's physically impossible!

368
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:54,060
<12-17,Ross>你知道么
<12-17,Ross>You know what?

369

442
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,510
<14-1,Rachel>你真的以为我不跟你告别
<14-1,Rachel>You think I didn't say goodbye to you

443
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:04,240
<14-1,Rachel>是因为我不在乎你
<14-1,Rachel>because I don't care?

444
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,920
<14-2,Ross>看起来就是这样啊
<14-2,Ross>That's what it seemed like.

445
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,370
<14-3,Rachel>我真不敢相信
<14-3,Rachel>I cannot believe that after 10 years

446
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:10,570
<14-3,Rachel>都十年了 你居然对我连最起码的了解都没有
<14-3,Rachel>you do not know one thing about me!

447
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:12,550
<14-4,Ross>那你倒说说  你为什么不跟我告别呢
<14-4,Ross>Then why didn't you say something?

448
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:16,160
<14-5,Rachel>因为...那对我来说太困难了  罗斯
<14-5,Rachel>Because it is too damn hard, Ross!

449
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,990
<14-5,Rachel>一想到我会那么挂念你
<14-5,Rachel>I can't even begin to explain to you

450
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:21,200
<14-5,Rachel>我根本就开不了口
<14-5,Rachel>how much I am gonna miss you.

451
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,450
<14-5,Rachel>每当我想到自己不能再天天看到你
<14-5,Rachel>When I think about not seeing you every day,

452
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:26,240
<14-5,Rachel>我就不想走了
<14-5,Rachel>it makes me not want to go.

453
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,800
<14-5,Rachel>如果你以为
<14-5,Rachel>Okay? So if you think that

454
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,020
<14-1,Rachel>我不跟你告别是因为
<14-1,Rachel>I didn't say goodbye to you...

455
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,620
<14-5,Rachel>你对我来说不如
<14-5,Rachel>...because you don't mean as much to me

456
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,780
<14-5,Rachel>其他人那样重要  那么你错了
<14-5,Rachel>as everybody else, you're wrong.

457
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:36,200
<14-5,Rachel>对我来说你比他们都重要
<14-5,Rachel>It's because you mean more to me.

458
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:39,650
<14-5,Rachel>好了  现在明白了吧  这就是你要的告别
