<1-1,Monica>This one's rare. This one's medium-well. Go, go, go!

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,600
<1-3,Monica>菲比  晚餐好吃吗
<1-3,Monica>Hey, Phoebe! How was dinner?!

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,980
<1-5,Monica>晚餐很好吃  我只是来打招呼  我要走了
<1-5,Monica>Dinner was good! Just saying hi! Now I'm gonna go!

4
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:14,610
<1-7,Monica>你好啊

5
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:18,030
<1-9,Guy>我在菜单上没看到这道美味
<1-9,Guy>I didn't see this on the menu.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,760
<1-11,Monica>提姆  她是菲比
<1-11,Monica>Tim, this is Phoebe.

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,810
<1-11,Monica>菲比  他是新来的副厨师长提姆
<1-11,Monica>Phoebe, this is Tim, my new sous chef.

8
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,630
<1-12,Phoebe>-你是莫妮卡的老板  -不  她是我的老板
<1-12,Phoebe>- So you're Monica's boss? - No, she's my boss.

9
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,610
<1-13,Tim>"副"在法文里是"之下"的意思
<1-13,Tim>"Sous" is French for "under."

10
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:28,530
<1-14,Phoebe>我副[明]白了
<1-14,Phoebe>I "sous-stand."

11
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:31,670
<1-15,Monica>提姆  我要一份乌贼跟一份凯撒沙拉
<1-15,Monica>Tim, I need a calamari and a caesar salad.

12
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:33,560
<1-15,Monica>你可以把青酱递给我吗
<1-15,Monica>And could you get me the pesto?

13
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,620
<1-18,Tim>-青酱是你做的吗  -没错
<1-18,Tim>- You made pesto? - Yes, I did.

14
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:39,030
<1-19,Phoebe>你觉得你的青酱是最"棒"的吗
<1-19,Phoebe>Would you say your pesto is the best-o?

15
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:42,960
<1-20,Tim>我不知道  我会说它真的很"强"
<1-20,Tim>I don't know. I would say it's pretty good-o.

16
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,360
<1-21,Monica>别忘了给我拿乌贼跟沙拉
<1-21,Monica>I still need the calamari and salad.

17
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,730
<1-22,Tim>我喜欢你的项链
<1-22,Tim>I like your necklace.

18
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:52,040
<1-23,Phoebe>-这是我自己做的  -你真的好有天份
<1-23,Phoebe>- I made it myself. - You are so talented.

19
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,040
<1-23,Phoebe>还是不够"酱"
<1-23,Phoebe>Well, it's no pesto.

20
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,020
<1-22,Tim>我们就别兜圈子了
<1-22,Tim>Alright, alright. Let's just cut to the chase.

21
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,020
<1-22,Tim>你是单身  你也单身
<1-22,Tim>Okay. You're single. You're single.

22
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:02,100
<1-22,Tim>他11点下班  她会等你的电话
<1-22,Tim>He gets off work at 11. She'll be waiting for your call.

23
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,970
<1-21,Monica>我会把你的电话号码给他
<1-21,Monica>I'll give him your number if I could just get

24
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:06,790
<1-21,Monica>只要你给我乌贼跟凯撒沙拉
<1-21,Monica>one calamari and one caesar salad!

25
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:12,530
<1-18,Tim>我没有大叫  我不必被罚一块钱
<1-18,Tim>I did not yell. I am not putting a dollar in the jar.

37
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,770
<2-1,Mr. Franklin>宾  你还在熬夜加班
<2-1,Mr. Franklin>Wow, Bing! Burning the midnight oil.

38
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:59,110
<2-2,Chandler>你很了解我的  老板
<2-2,Chandler>You know me, sir.

39
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:01,670
<2-2,Chandler>我正好有个问题问你
<2-2,Chandler>I do have a question for you.

40
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:03,950
<2-2,Chandler>你知道要怎么避开公司的电脑网路
<2-2,Chandler>Do you know how I can get around the office computer network...

41
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,890
<2-2,Chandler>看劲爆火辣的国际黄片吗
<2-2,Chandler>...so I can access the really good Internet porn?

42
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,180
<2-3,Mr. Franklin>你真爱开玩笑  宾
<2-3,Mr. Franklin>You're a joker, Bing.

43
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:13,490
<2-4,Chandler>那有什么好笑的
<2-4,Chandler>What's funny about that?

44
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:16,700
<2-5,Ross>抱歉让你等这么久
<2-5,Ross>Sorry I kept you waiting so long.

45
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,900
<2-6,Chandler>没关系  你想去哪里
<2-6,Chandler>That's okay. Where do you wanna go?

46
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:21,800
<2-7,Ross>我以为你知道我要去哪里
<2-7,Ross>I think you know where I wanna go.

47
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,790
<2-8,Chandler>-硬石餐厅  -对
<2-8,Chandler>- The Hard Rock Cafe? - Yeah.

48
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,520
<2-10,Chandler>-又要去  -对
<2-10,Chandler>- Again? - Yeah.

49
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,320
<2-11,Ross>我真的很喜欢那里的食物
<2-11,Ross>I'm telling you, I like the food.

50
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:32,540
<2-13,Chandler>你是喜欢那里的紫雨展示品
<2-13,Chandler>You like the Purple Rain display.

51
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:37,090
<2-14,Bob>-巴伯  -托比  祝你今晚玩得开心
<2-14,Bob>- Hey, Bob. - Hey, Toby. Have a good night.

52
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,430
<2-15,Ross>那家伙叫你托比
<2-15,Ross>Did that guy just call you Toby?

53
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,360
<2-16,Chandler>对  他以为那是我的名字
<2-16,Chandler>Yeah, he thinks that's my name.

54
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,040
<2-17,Ross>你为什么不更正他
<2-17,Ross>Why don't you correct him?

55
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,400
<2-18,Chandler>现在纠正有点太晚了
<2-18,Chandler>It's been going on way too long now.

56
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,530
<2-18,Chandler>他第一次这么叫我  我们只是在走廊擦肩而过
<2-18,Chandler>The first time he said it, we were just passing each other in the hallway,

57
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:52,580
<2-18,Chandler>所以我什么都没说
<2-18,Chandler>so I didn't say anything.

58
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:55,490
<2-18,Chandler>第二次他说"托比  你要吃甜甜圈吗"
<2-18,Chandler>The next time he said, "Hey, Toby, want a doughnut?"

59
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,040
<2-18,Chandler>我确实想吃甜甜圈
<2-18,Chandler>I wanted the doughnut.

60
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:03,070
<2-18,Chandler>五年后甜甜圈早就消化光了 我还是托比
<2-18,Chandler>Five years later, the doughnut's gone and I'm still Toby.

61
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:06,080
<2-19,Ross>五年了  钱德勒  你得告诉他
<2-19,Ross>Five years. Chandler, you have to tell him.

62
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,130
<2-20,Chandler>不行  那多尴尬啊
<2-20,Chandler>No. That would be so awkward.

63
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:11,320
<2-20,Chandler>再说  我们不在同一个楼层工作  他在六楼
<2-20,Chandler>Besides, we don't work together. He's on the sixth floor.

64
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,870
<2-20,Chandler>他只是偶尔才会叫我一次托比  没什么
<2-20,Chandler>So he calls me Toby once in a while. What's the big deal?

65
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,520
<2-20,Chandler>这已经算不错了  反正他不是叫我妙丽
<2-20,Chandler>It could be worse. It's not like he's calling me Muriel.

66
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,400
<2-21,Ross>妙丽  他为什么要叫你妙丽
<2-21,Ross>Muriel. Why would he call you Muriel?

67
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,140
<2-21,Ross>天啊
<2-21,Ross>Oh, my God.

68
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,520
<2-21,Ross>钱德勒·M·宾
<2-21,Ross>Chandler "M." Bing.

69
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:37,250
<2-21,Ross>那不仅是个M  你的中间名是妙丽
<2-21,Ross>It's not just an "M." Your middle name is Muriel!

70
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,570
<2-22,Chandler>那是家族名字
<2-22,Chandler>It is a family name.

71
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:44,230
<2-23,Ross>钱德勒·妙丽·宾
<2-23,Ross>Chandler Muriel Bing.

72
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:49,000
<2-23,Ross>你父母真是完全不给你留活路  对吧
<2-23,Ross>Your parents never even gave you a chance, did they?

73
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:54,890
<2-23,Ross>德瑞克  我找出你丧失记忆的原因了
<2-23,Ross>Drake, I've discovered the reason for your memory loss.

74
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:55,960
<3-1,Dr. Drake Ramoray>为什么
<3-1,Dr. Drake Ramoray>What is it?

75
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:59,280
<3-1,Dr. Drake Ramoray>你的脑部移植手术并未完全成功
<3-1,Dr. Drake Ramoray>Apparently your brain transplant was not entirely successful.

76
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,270
<3-2,Dr. Drake Ramoray>你的身体在排斥洁西卡的脑部
<3-2,Dr. Drake Ramoray>It seems your body's rejecting Jessica's brain.

77
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:03,600
<3-2,Dr. Drake Ramoray>很严重吗
<3-2,Dr. Drake Ramoray>Is it serious?

78
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,380
<3-2,Dr. Drake Ramoray>如果我们可以从捐赠者的身体抽取组织...
<3-2,Dr. Drake Ramoray>Not if we extract tissue from the original body...

79
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:10,120
<3-2,Dr. Drake Ramoray>合成抗体  将其导入你体内
<3-2,Dr. Drake Ramoray>...and synthesize antibodies and introduce them to your system

80
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,770
<3-3,Dr. Drake Ramoray>以此来解除排异效应
<3-3,Dr. Drake Ramoray>which could stop you from rejecting the brain.

81
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:16,060
<3-3,Dr. Drake Ramoray>听起来很简单  我们就按你说的做吧
<3-3,Dr. Drake Ramoray>That sounds simple enough. Let's just do that.

82
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:18,100
<3-5,Joey>我们可以那么做
<3-5,Joey>We would,

83
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,470
<3-6,Rachel>但我们想挖出洁西卡的尸体时
<3-6,Rachel>but when we went to exhume Jessica's body...

84
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,480
<3-3,Dr. Drake Ramoray>发现它不见了
<3-3,Dr. Drake Ramoray>...it was gone.

85
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,600
<3-4,Director>卡
<3-4,Director>Cut.

86
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:29,080
<3-4,Director>非常不错  大伙们
<3-4,Director>Very nice, people.

87
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,750
<3-5,Joey>我换好衣服后  我们就可以去吃晚餐了
<3-5,Joey>Okay, let me just get changed and we can go to dinner.

88
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:33,130
<3-6,Rachel>洁西卡的尸体怎么了
<3-6,Rachel>What happened to Jessica's body?

89
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:35,450
<3-7,Joey>我不能剧透  你得看电视才会知道
<3-7,Joey>I'm not telling you. You'll have to see it on TV.

90
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:39,360
<3-9,Joey>-你不知道  对吧  -对  我也不在乎
<3-9,Joey>- You don't know, do you? - No. couldn't care less.

91
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,630
<3-10,Joey>-你表现得很好  -你也是
<3-10,Joey>- Good scene, man. - You too.

92
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:48,200
<3-11,Joey>怎么  你根本不是演员
<3-11,Joey>What? You weren't in it.

93
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,970
<3-14,Kash>凯许  她是我朋友瑞秋
<3-14,Kash>Kash, this is my friend Rachel.

94
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:54,830
<3-15,Joey>二位互相认识一下
<3-15,Joey>Rachel, Kash. Kash, Rachel.

95
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,790
<3-17,Kash>为什么之前我没有见过你
<3-17,Kash>Why haven't I seen you here before?

96
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:01,720
<3-18,Rachel>乔伊觉得我会丢他的脸
<3-18,Rachel>Joey just thinks I'll embarrass him.

97
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,810
<3-18,Rachel>他认为我是肥皂剧脑残粉
<3-18,Rachel>He thinks I'm a soap opera nut.

98
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,800
<3-18,Rachel>我才不是  真的
<3-18,Rachel>Which I'm not. I'm not.

99
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:08,610
<3-18,Rachel>虽然我的确知道
<3-18,Rachel>Although, I do know

100

<3-19,Joey>- Look, I'm just stroking your arm. - Here we go. Here we go.

<4-1,Phoebe>帮我跟华利问好
<4-1,Phoebe>Say hi to Wally.

105
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,140
<4-2,Monica>莫妮卡
<4-2,Monica>Monica.

106
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:34,080
<4-3,Phoebe>昨晚我跟提姆玩得很开心
<4-3,Phoebe>Oh, my god. I had the best time with Tim last night.

107
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,090
<4-3,Phoebe>他真的很体贴
<4-3,Phoebe>He is so sweet.

108
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:38,560
<4-3,Phoebe>我等不及钻到他的身体"下"面去
<4-3,Phoebe>I can't wait to get "sous-neath" him.

109
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:42,870
<4-4,Monica>-我得开除他  -为什么
<4-4,Monica>- I have to fire him. - Why?

110
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:46,400
<4-6,Monica>他很不称职  动作超慢  还会把食物烧焦
<4-6,Monica>He's terrible. He's slow. He burns things.

111
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,810
<4-6,Monica>昨晚他还把我的甜点主厨烧着了
<4-6,Monica>Last night he lit my pastry chef on fire.

112
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:52,850
<4-7,Phoebe>他可能是太紧张了  你老是凶巴巴的
<4-7,Phoebe>Maybe he was just nervous. You can be intimidating.

113
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:54,560
<4-7,Phoebe>我见过你的甜点主厨
<4-7,Phoebe>Besides,  I've met your pastry chef,

114
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,830
<4-7,Phoebe>她牛哄哄的  也该灭灭她的威风了
<4-7,Phoebe>and she can stand to be taken down a peg or two.

115
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,910
<4-8,Monica>现在她没有眉毛了  任务完成
<4-8,Monica>Well, now she has no eyebrows. Mission accomplished.

116
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,290
<4-9,Phoebe>莫妮卡  他热爱他的工作
<4-9,Phoebe>But, Monica, he loves his job so much.

117
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:07,090
<4-9,Phoebe>你不能再给他一次机会吗  拜托
<4-9,Phoebe>Can't you just give him another chance, please?

118
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:12,730
<4-10,Monica>好吧  但如果他再放火烧别人  他非走不可
<4-10,Monica>All right. But if he lights someone else on fire, he's out of there.

119
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:16,370
<4-11,Phoebe>那很公平  谢谢你
<4-11,Phoebe>That's fair. Thank you so much. Thanks.

120
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,150
<4-11,Phoebe>看起来他烧甜点主厨的时候
<4-11,Phoebe>Oops. Looks like when he got the pastry chef,

121
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:20,920
<4-11,Phoebe>也烧到你了
<4-11,Phoebe>he got you a little bit too.

122
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,040
<4-12,Monica>我这是花钱去做的头发
<4-12,Monica>I paid to have this done.

123
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,250
<4-13,Phoebe>我喜欢
<4-13,Phoebe>Love it!

124

<5-2,Rachel>知道吗  凯许真的喜欢你
<5-2,Rachel>Hey. You know, Kash really liked you the other day.

125
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,290
<5-3,Joey>他觉得你很迷人
<5-3,Joey>He said he thought you were charming.

126
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,780
<5-4,Rachel>-我以为自己蠢到家了  -我站在你这边
<5-4,Rachel>- I thought I was a complete idiot. - I'm with you.

127
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,820
<5-5,Joey>他还问我你会不会愿意跟他约会
<5-5,Joey>He even asked me if I thought you'd go out with him.

128
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,790
<5-6,Rachel>我感觉快要吐了
<5-6,Rachel>I think I'm gonna throw up a little.

129
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:50,450
<5-7,Joey>-你怎么说  -我说不会
<5-7,Joey>- What did you say? - I said, "No."

130
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,020
<5-8,Rachel>什么
<5-8,Rachel>What?

131
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,370
<5-9,Joey>我觉得既然你怀孕了
<5-9,Joey>What? I just figured since you're pregnant,

132
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:57,060
<5-9,Joey>就不会跟别人约会了
<5-9,Joey>you're not gonna be seeing people.

133
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,400
<5-10,Rachel>乔伊
<5-10,Rachel>Okay, Joey.

134
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:03,200
<5-10,Rachel>首先  他是凯许·福特  不是一般人
<5-10,Rachel>First of all, Kash Ford? Not people.

135
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,730
<5-10,Rachel>其次  你告诉他我怀孕了  他说了什么
<5-10,Rachel>Second of all, what did he say when you told him I was pregnant?

136
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:09,500
<5-11,Joey>我没告诉他  我不确定你要不要告诉别人
<5-11,Joey>I didn't tell him. I didn't know if you're telling people.

137
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,100
<5-11,Joey>那时候我以为凯许只是"一般人"
<5-11,Joey>This back when I thought Kash was still "people."

138
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:13,540
<5-12,Rachel>很好  别告诉他
<5-12,Rachel>Good, good. Don't tell him. Don't tell him.

139
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,780
<5-12,Rachel>让他打电话给我
<5-12,Rachel>Just have him call me, okay?

140
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,670
<5-13,Joey>瑞秋  我觉得这样不...
<5-13,Joey>Rach, look. I really don't think that's such a great...

141
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,230
<5-14,Rachel>照我的话做  不然我会回到摄影棚
<5-14,Rachel>Okay. You go do it or I'll come back to that set.

142
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,410
<5-14,Rachel>泡其他的男演员  一个都不放过
<5-14,Rachel>I'll meet more actors. I'll meet them all.

143
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:27,160
<6-2,Bob>-巴伯  -我朋友托比今天还好吗
<6-2,Bob>- Hey, Bob. - How's my pal Toby doing today?

144
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,080
<6-3,Chandler>我看到他时会帮你问一下
<6-3,Chandler>If I see him, I'll ask.

145
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,870
<6-6,Chandler>你刚刚在跟六楼的巴伯说话吗
<6-6,Chandler>Was that Bob from six you were just talking to?

146
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,830
<6-7,Mr. Franklin>-对  -你们互相认识
<6-7,Mr. Franklin>- Yeah. - Then you know each other?

147
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:41,090
<6-8,Chandler>我们知道彼此的名字而已
<6-8,Chandler>We're on a semi-first-name basis.

148
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:45,250
<6-9,Mr. Franklin>-如果他加入我们的团队呢  -巴伯吗
<6-9,Mr. Franklin>- What do you think of adding him to our team? - Bob?

149
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:49,250
<6-10,Chandler>每天跟我们在这里一起工作
<6-10,Chandler>Working here with us? Every day?

150
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,950
<6-10,Chandler>我不知道他有没有那个能耐
<6-10,Chandler>Yeah. I don't know if he has what it takes.

151
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:54,140
<6-11,Mr. Franklin>是吗  六楼的人很喜欢他
<6-11,Mr. Franklin>Really? They love him down on six.

152
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,550
<6-12,Chandler>但这里是11楼
<6-12,Chandler>But this is 11.

153
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,690
<6-12,Chandler>这里的工作要难上两倍
<6-12,Chandler>It's almost twice as hard up here.

154
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,440
<6-13,Mr. Franklin>好吧  我明白你的意思了
<6-13,Mr. Franklin>Okay, I hear you loud and clear.

155
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,320
<6-13,Mr. Franklin>-巴伯还是不能调职  -我想那样最好
<6-13,Mr. Franklin>- Bob will stay put. - I think it's best, sir.

156
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,480
<6-14,Chandler>但我们真的急需新鲜血液
<6-14,Chandler>But we really do need to find someone up here.

157
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,330
<6-15,Mr. Franklin>工作开始越积越多了
<6-15,Mr. Franklin>Work is starting to pile up.

158
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:11,120
<6-15,Mr. Franklin>我桌上的文件已经叠到这么高了
<6-15,Mr. Franklin>I've got a stack of documents on my desk this high.

159
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,070
<6-16,Chandler>我给你出个主意  把它们丢到碎纸机里
<6-16,Chandler>You know what we should do. Just toss them in the shredder

160
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,830
<6-16,Chandler>就说你从来没有收到它们
<6-16,Chandler>and claim you never got them.

161
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:18,840
<6-17,Mr. Franklin>那真的很好笑  宾
<6-17,Mr. Franklin>That's a good one, Bing.

162
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:23,320
<6-18,Chandler>我该怎么做他们才会觉得我是认真的
<6-18,Chandler>What does a guy have to do to be taken seriously around here?

163
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,680
<7-2,Monica>我又给了他一次机会  但提姆非走不可
<7-2,Monica>Okay, I gave him another chance, but Tim has got to go.

164
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:34,410
<7-3,Phoebe>-但...  -不行  他太不称职了
<7-3,Phoebe>- But... - No, no, no. He is totally incompetent.

165
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:36,720
<7-4,Monica>我打电话给推荐他给我的厨师
<7-4,Monica>I called the chef who recommended him to me.

166
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:39,240
<7-4,Monica>他说"哈哈  整到你了"
<7-4,Monica>He said, "Ha, ha! Gotcha!"

167
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:43,190
<7-5,Phoebe>-但别今天开除他  -为什么
<7-5,Phoebe>- Okay, okay. But you can't fire him today. - Why not?

168
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,170
<7-7,Phoebe>因为今天我要甩掉他
<7-7,Phoebe>Because I'm dumping him today.

169
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,060
<7-8,Monica>什么  你说他很体贴
<7-8,Monica>What? You said he was so sweet.

170
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,440
<7-9,Phoebe>他确实体贴  但也太体贴了
<7-9,Phoebe>He is sweet. He's too sweet.

171
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:51,550
<7-9,Phoebe>老是打电话给我
<7-9,Phoebe>He calls me all the time.

172
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:53,470
<7-9,Phoebe>"你平安回家了吗
<7-9,Phoebe>"Did you get home from work okay?

173
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,460
<7-9,Phoebe>你洗澡没出事吧"
<7-9,Phoebe>Did you get out of the shower okay?"

174
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:58,040
<7-10,Monica>-别接电话不就得了  -那他会亲自过来
<7-10,Monica>- Just don't pick up your phone. - Then he comes over!

175
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,960
<7-11,Phoebe>"我好担心你"  有点男子气概吧
<7-11,Phoebe>"I was so worried about you." Be a man!

176
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,290
<7-12,Monica>所以现在我不能开除他
<7-12,Monica>So now I'm not allowed to fire him?

177
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:06,310
<7-13,Phoebe>我们不能让他在同一天既失业又失恋
<7-13,Phoebe>We can't fire him and dump him on the same day.

178
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:07,560
<7-13,Phoebe>他会自杀的
<7-13,Phoebe>He'll kill himself.

179
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,730
<7-14,Monica>那我今天开除他
<7-14,Monica>Okay, well then, I'll fire him today,

180
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:10,370
<7-14,Monica>你再跟他交往一星期
<7-14,Monica>and you go out with him another week.

181
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:12,140
<7-15,Phoebe>你开什么玩笑  再跟他交往一个星期
<7-15,Phoebe>Are you kidding? Another week with that simp,

182
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,890
<7-15,Phoebe>我会自杀的
<7-15,Phoebe>I'll kill myself.

183
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:18,090
<7-16,Monica>我们都在今天跟他摊牌  让他自己想办法应付
<7-16,Monica>Okay, then we'll both do it today and he'll just have to deal with it.

184
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:21,320
<7-17,Phoebe>好吧  但问题是谁要先说呢
<7-17,Phoebe>Okay. But the question is who's gonna go first?

185
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,430
<7-17,Phoebe>后说的就是贱人
<7-17,Phoebe>Whoever goes second is the bitch.

186
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:27,960
<7-18,Monica>-什么意思  -开除刚失恋的员工
<7-18,Monica>- What do you mean?  - Come on, fire a guy that's just been dumped?

187
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,650
<7-19,Phoebe>贱人  甩掉刚失业的恋人
<7-19,Phoebe>Bitch! And dump a guy that's just been fired?

188
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,190
<7-19,Phoebe>金发贱人
<7-19,Phoebe>Blond bitch!

189
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,760
<7-20,Monica>我几天前就想开除他  所以应该让我先说
<7-20,Monica>I wanted to do this days ago, so I think I should go first.

190
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,220
<7-21,Phoebe>好吧  你说得有理
<7-21,Phoebe>All right, that makes sense.

191
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:44,330
<7-21,Phoebe>去你的  我要先说
<7-21,Phoebe>But screw you! I'm going first!

192
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,110
<8-1,Bob>-托比  你有空吗  -当然  什么事
<8-1,Bob>- Toby, you got a sec? - Sure. What's up?

193
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,270
<8-3,Bob>我们刚开完会
<8-3,Bob>I just had a meeting.

194
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,540
<8-3,Bob>我本想被调职到这里来
<8-3,Bob>I was actually hoping to get transferred up here,

195
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:57,320
<8-3,Bob>但刚发现我的美梦破灭了
<8-3,Bob>but I just found out it's not gonna happen.

196
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,600
<8-3,Bob>很明显有人认为我不是"11楼的材料"
<8-3,Bob>Apparently somebody thinks I'm not "11 th-floor material."

197
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:05,140
<8-3,Bob>钱德勒到底是谁
<8-3,Bob>Say, who the hell is this Chandler?

198
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,430
<8-3,Bob>今晚约会时哪个藉口
<8-3,Bob>What do you think is a better excuse

199
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:11,900
<8-3,Bob>最适合我用来挡酒
<8-3,Bob>for why I'm not drinking on this date tonight?

200
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:15,360
<9-1,Rachel>"我正在戒酒"  "我是摩门教徒"
<9-1,Rachel>"I'm a recovering alcoholic," "I'm a Mormon"...

201
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,680
<9-1,Rachel>或是"我昨晚喝太醉现在还在宿醉"
<9-1,Rachel>...or "I got so hammered last night I'm still a little drunk"?

202
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:24,110
<9-4,Joey>今晚你要做什么
<9-4,Joey>So, what do you want to do tonight?

203
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:25,670
<9-5,Ross>安杰丽卡有部很棒的乌克兰电影上映
<9-5,Ross>There’s a Ukrainian film at the Angelica

204
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:28,470
<9-5,Ross>听说很震撼人心  你想看吗
<9-5,Ross>that's supposed to be very powerful. Interested?

205
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,110
<9-5,Ross>没兴趣
<9-5,Ross>No. No.

206
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:32,460
<9-6,Joey>但我可以陪你看一般人看的电影
<9-6,Joey>But I'll go see a normal-person movie with you.

207
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:34,130
<9-7,Ross>瑞秋  你要一起来吗
<9-7,Ross>Rach, you wanna come?

208
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:36,200
<9-8,Rachel>不行  我有约会
<9-8,Rachel>Oh, no. I can't. I've got a date.

209
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:41,000
<9-10,Rachel>-约会  -对  怎么了  很奇怪吗
<9-10,Rachel>- A date? - Yeah. Why, is that weird for you?

210
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,940
<9-11,Ross>不  一点都不奇怪  那很正常
<9-11,Ross>Why, no. It's the opposite of weird. It's regular.

211
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:49,900
<9-11,Ross>太普通了  事实上还有点无聊
<9-11,Ross>It's mundane. It's actually a little dull.

212
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,490
<9-12,Joey>它可不是乌克兰电影
<9-12,Joey>It's no Ukrainian film.

213
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,260
<9-13,Rachel>耳环
<9-13,Rachel>Earrings!

214
00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:00,610
<9-14,Ross>她有约会  对象是谁
<9-14,Ross>A date? She's got a date? With who?

215
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:02,520
<9-15,Joey>我撮合她跟一个男演员
<9-15,Joey>I set her up with this actor on my show.

216
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:06,080
<9-16,Ross>-是你帮她牵的红线  -不是
<9-16,Ross>- You set her up? - No.

217
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,040
<9-18,Ross>乔伊  你在想什么
<9-18,Ross>Joey, what were you thinking?

218
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,550
<9-19,Joey>我觉得应该没关系
<9-19,Joey>I was thinking that it would probably be okay...

219
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:13,640
<9-19,Joey>因为你们两个已经分手五年了
<9-19,Joey>because Ross hasn’t gone out with Rachel in five years!

220
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:17,080
<9-20,Ross>乔伊  我担心不是她  而是我的宝宝
<9-20,Ross>Joey, I'm not worried about her! I'm worried about my baby.

221
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,870
<9-20,Ross>跟她约会的人  也在跟我的宝宝约会
<9-20,Ross>Whoever she dates, my baby dates.

222
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:22,280
<9-20,Ross>这个"男演员"要带她去哪里
<9-20,Ross>Where is this "actor" taking them?

223
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,820
<9-21,Joey>我也是"男演员"
<9-21,Joey>Hey! I'm an "actor" too.

224
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,930
<9-21,Joey>他们大概要搭渡轮
<9-21,Joey>I'm not sure. I think they're taking the ferry

225
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:31,050
<9-21,Joey>到史坦顿岛玩
<9-21,Joey>out to some Italian place on Staten Island.

226
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:34,390
<9-22,Ross>渡轮  我的宝宝要搭渡轮
<9-22,Ross>A ferry? My baby's going on a ferry?

227
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,270
<9-22,Ross>你知道那有多危险吗
<9-22,Ross>Do you have any idea how dangerous those are?

228
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:38,910
<9-23,Joey>渡轮是指那种载车的
<9-23,Joey>Are we talking about one of those big boats

229
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:41,540
<9-23,Joey>速度缓慢的大船吧
<9-23,Joey>that carry cars that go like five miles an hour?

230
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:44,580
<9-24,Ross>他们为什么不去跳飞机  那多有意思
<9-24,Ross>Why not just jump out of an airplane. That-that's a fun date!

231
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:47,130
<9-24,Ross>或点火柴把彼此烧了  也很有意思
<9-24,Ross>or burn each other with matches? That's fun, too.

232
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:55,570
<9-26,Joey>-乔伊  -凯许  罗斯  他就是凯许
<9-26,Joey>- Hey, Joey. - Hey, Kash. This is Ross. Ross, this is Kash.

233
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,150
<9-28,Ross>我听说今晚你们要去搭渡轮
<9-28,Ross>Hey, I hear you're going on a ferry tonight.

234
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:01,380
<9-29,Kash>你挺大胆啊
<9-29,Kash>Bit of a daredevil, are we?

235
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,210

<10-1,Tim>那件裙子的确太露了
<10-1,Tim>And yes, it is too slutty!

<10-2,Phoebe>I'm so glad you called.

<10-3,Tim>感觉之前一直是我打给你
<10-3,Tim>I feel like it's always me calling you.

242
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:34,550
<10-3,Tim>什么事  菲比没事吧
<10-3,Tim>So, what's up? Is everything okay with Phoebe?

00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,120
<10-4,Phoebe>提姆  你真的很棒
<10-4,Phoebe>Tim, you're a really great guy.

245
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,750
<10-5,Tim>那是因为我跟你在一起
<10-5,Tim>That's because I'm with you.

246
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:51,830
<10-6,Phoebe>但我的人生现在走到了...
<10-6,Phoebe>It's just, I'm in a place in my life right now where...

247
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,620
<10-7,Tim>抱歉  "刚刚有消息传过来"
<10-7,Tim>So sorry. "This just in."

248
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,510
<10-7,Tim>是餐厅有急事呼我  莫妮卡要我马上赶过去
<10-7,Tim>Oh, it's 9-1-1 from the restaurant, that means Monica needs me right away.

249
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:02,260
<10-8,Phoebe>不是的  我知道发生了什么事
<10-8,Phoebe>No, she doesn't! I know what that is.

250
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,580
<10-8,Phoebe>你可以留下来
<10-8,Phoebe>You can stay.

251
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,610
<10-9,Tim>我也会想你的  菲比
<10-9,Tim>I'll miss you too, Pheebs.

252
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:11,500
<10-9,Tim>我会把你放在这里
<10-9,Tim>And I will be holding you right here.

253
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,910
<11-1,Joey>你想看哪部电影
<11-1,Joey>So, what movie do you wanna see?

254
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,900
<11-1,Joey>我不想看那种得认真看字幕的电影
<11-1,Joey>And not one I have to read, okay?

255
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,530
<11-1,Joey>我受够看书了
<11-1,Joey>I get that from books.

256
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:30,990
<11-3,Joey>-书  -好吧  汽车杂志  玉米片包装
<11-3,Joey>- Books? - Alright, car magazines, cereal boxes...

257
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:32,460
<11-3,Joey>但那就够我受的了
<11-3,Joey>...but it's enough!

258
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:36,400
<11-4,Ross>我们别去看电影了
<11-4,Ross>I tell you what. Why don't we just stay here?

259
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,410
<11-4,Ross>就待在家里玩吧
<11-4,Ross>Let's not see a movie, we'll just and hang.

260
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:41,030
<11-5,Joey>你要等瑞秋约会回来吗
<11-5,Joey>Just wait for Rachel to come back from her date?

261
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:44,190
<11-6,Ross>如果你想那么做的话  我不会反对
<11-6,Ross>Hey, if that's what you wanna do, I'm not gonna say no.

262
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,860
<11-7,Joey>哥们  你这是怎么了
<11-7,Joey>Dude, what is going on?

263
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:51,230
<11-8,Ross>-我得知道他们约会进行得怎样  -为什么
<11-8,Ross>- I have to find out how it went. - Why?

264
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:53,600
<11-10,Ross>他可能是我孩子的继父
<11-10,Ross>This guy could be my baby's stepfather.

265
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,730
<11-11,Joey>才约会一次  你就担心他们要结婚了
<11-11,Joey>They go on one date and you're worried about them getting married?!

266
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,260
<11-11,Joey>他又不是你
<11-11,Joey>He's not you!

267
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:03,320
<11-12,Ross>我不敢相信她去约会了
<11-12,Ross>I just... I can't believe she's dating!

268
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:05,450
<11-13,Joey>罗斯  你觉得她该怎么做呢
<11-13,Joey>Ross, what did you think she was gonna do?

269
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:06,650
<11-13,Joey>我不知道
<11-13,Joey>I don't know.

270
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:10,470
<11-14,Ross>我不敢相信会发生这种事
<11-14,Ross>I guess I just can't believe any of this is happening.

271
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:12,620
<11-15,Joey>你是什么意思
<11-15,Joey>What do you mean?

272
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,680
<11-16,Ross>我以为我再生个孩子
<11-16,Ross>It's just I always thought when I had another kid,

273
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,300
<11-16,Ross>情况会不一样
<11-16,Ross>it'd be different.

274
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,810
<11-16,Ross>我爱本
<11-16,Ross>I love Ben.

275
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:22,610
<11-16,Ross>但每次送他到卡罗尔跟苏珊家
<11-16,Ross>But every time  I drop him off at Carol and Susan's...

276
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,770
<11-16,Ross>我都会觉得很伤心
<11-16,Ross>...it breaks my heart a little.

277
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:31,390
<11-16,Ross>我一直想像着  我跟未来的太太周末躺在床上
<11-16,Ross>I've always had this picture of me and my next wife in bed on Sunday,

278
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:34,320
<11-16,Ross>我的孩子跑过来跳到床上
<11-16,Ross>my kid comes running in, leaps up on the bed

279
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,900
<11-16,Ross>我们会一起看报纸
<11-16,Ross>and we all read the paper together, you know?

280
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:40,260
<11-16,Ross>或许还会抢着看科学版
<11-16,Ross>Maybe fight over the science section.

281
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,520
<11-17,Joey>很棒啊  你现在还是有机会过那样的生活
<11-17,Joey>That's a nice picture. You can still have that.

282
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,900
<11-18,Ross>不  瑞秋跟别的男人约会去了
<11-18,Ross>No. No, I can't. Rachel's out with some guy.

283
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,170
<11-18,Ross>我的孩子跟她一起去了
<11-18,Ross>My baby went with her.

284
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:55,420
<11-18,Ross>那个梦想只会离我越来越远了
<11-18,Ross>If anything, that picture keeps moving further away.

285
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:59,610
<11-19,Joey>我能问你一件事吗
<11-19,Joey>Hey, can I ask you something?

286
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:03,120
<11-19,Joey>你想像你未来太太的时候
<11-19,Joey>In this picture of you and your wife,

287
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,320
<11-19,Joey>她是瑞秋吗
<11-19,Joey>is your wife Rachel?

288
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:08,230
<11-20,Ross>以前是的
<11-20,Ross>It used to be.

289
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,930
<11-20,Ross>现在我梦里的人没有具体的相貌
<11-20,Ross>Now she doesn't really have a face.

290
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:16,760
<11-20,Ross>但她的身材超火辣
<11-20,Ross>Smokin body, though.

291
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:24,390
<11-21,Joey>说得好  但是罗斯  她已经不是瑞秋了
<11-21,Joey>Good call. But the face, Ross, the face isn't Rachel.

292
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:28,410
<11-22,Ross>对  但如果是的话  事情会简单很多吧
<11-22,Ross>No. But how much easier would it be if it were?

293
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:30,960
<11-23,Joey>我懂  但那不是她要的生活
<11-23,Joey>Yeah, I know, but I don't think that's not what she wants.

294
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,940
<11-24,Ross>那也不是我想要的生活
<11-24,Ross>No, it's not what I want either.

295
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:34,810
<11-24,Ross>我不能逼自己再爱上她
<11-24,Ross>I mean I-I can't force myself to fall in love with her again now.

296
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:38,640
<11-25,Joey>罗斯  或许你需要新的展望
<11-25,Joey>Okay, Ross, maybe you need a new picture, okay?

297
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,760
<11-25,Joey>它会跟你之前的梦想不一样
<11-25,Joey>It won't be what you thought.

298
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,660
<11-25,Joey>但不论如何...
<11-25,Joey>But no matter what...

299
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:47,360
<11-25,Joey>你都将迎来一个新的生命  你的孩子
<11-25,Joey>...there's gonna be a brand-new little baby. Your baby.

300
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,090
<11-25,Joey>谁在乎梦想是什么样的呢
<11-25,Joey>Who cares what the picture looks like?

301
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:52,850
<11-26,Ross>对
<11-26,Ross>Yeah.

302
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,460
<11-27,Joey>我们一起出去找点乐子吧
<11-27,Joey>I tell you what. Let's you and me go out and have some fun.

303
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,540
<11-27,Joey>你想做什么都行  来吧
<11-27,Joey>Whatever you want. Come on.

304
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:03,150
<11-28,Ross>我们还赶得上看乌克兰电影
<11-28,Ross>We can catch that Ukrainian film.

305
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,580
<11-29,Joey>不  我说找乐子
<11-29,Joey>No, I said fun.

<12-2,Chandler>-嘿  托比  -嘿  巴比
<12-2,Chandler>- Hey, Toby? - Hey, Bobby.

<12-3,Bob>It's Bob, actually.

308
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:17,440
<12-3,Bob>你在这里工作  钱德勒·宾的办公室在哪里
<12-3,Bob>You work up here. Can you tell me where this Chandler Bing's office is?

309

<12-4,Chandler>就在...

<12-4,Chandler>就在那里  你问这个做什么
<12-4,Chandler>Right there. Let me ask you, why?

311
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,410
<12-5,Bob>我想找那个混蛋谈谈
<12-5,Bob>I wanna talk to that bastard,

312
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:28,610
<12-5,Bob>看他跟我有什么过节
<12-5,Bob>See what his problem is.

313
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:30,650
<12-6,Chandler>好吧  巴伯  听我说
<12-6,Chandler>Okay, Bob. Listen.

314
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,920
<12-6,Chandler>是我害你无法调职
<12-6,Chandler>I'm the reason you didn't get the job up here.

315
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:37,770
<12-8,Chandler>-托比  不要  -巴伯
<12-8,Chandler>- Toby, don't. - Bob.

316
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:41,770
<12-9,Bob>托比  别替他背黑锅了
<12-9,Bob>Toby, I'm not gonna let you cover for him.

317
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:46,330
<12-9,Bob>你说任何话只会让我更气钱德勒
<12-9,Bob>Anything you say will just get me more upset with Chandler.

318
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:49,280
<12-10,Chandler>那还真是让我进退两难
<12-10,Chandler>That puts me in a difficult position.

319
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:54,760
<13-2,Tim>我收到你的寻呼了  没事吧
<13-2,Tim>I got your page. Is everything okay?

320
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,660

<13-6,Phoebe>-菲比  -莫妮卡

<13-12,Tim>-你被开除了  -为什么
<13-12,Tim>- You're fired. - Why?

330
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:22,550
<13-13,Phoebe>抱歉  我还没有准备好跟别人长期交住
<13-13,Phoebe>I'm sorry. I'm not ready for a relationship right now.

331
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:27,400
<13-14,Monica>我也很抱歉  但我喜欢凡事照我的方法来做
<13-14,Monica>I'm sorry too. But I like things done a certain way.

332
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,810
<13-14,Monica>我们之间的化学反应不对
<13-14,Monica>The chemistry's just not right.

333
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:32,480
<13-15,Phoebe>这个理由很好  我们也是一样
<13-15,Phoebe>Oh that's good, the chemistry thing for us too.

334
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:37,620
<13-15,Phoebe>好吧
<13-15,Phoebe>Wow. Okay.

335
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:41,750
<13-16,Tim>我知道我大黏人了
<13-16,Tim>I realize I came on a little strong,

336
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,420
<13-16,Tim>那是因为我觉得你很棒
<13-16,Tim>but it's because I think you're so amazing.

337
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,800
<13-16,Tim>我要告诉你
<13-16,Tim>I just wanna tell you how much

338
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,920
<13-16,Tim>我很感激你给我这个机会

339
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:54,590
<13-16,Tim>你是我合作过最有天份的厨师
<13-16,Tim>because you're the most talented chef I've ever worked for.

340
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:57,600
<13-16,Tim>总之...

342
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,930
<13-19,Monica>我话说得太快了  这份工作需要时间学习
<13-19,Monica>I think I spoke too quickly. There's a learning curve with this job.

343
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:14,920
<13-19,Monica>或许我们可以再试一次
<13-19,Monica>And maybe we could try it again.

344
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,140
<13-20,Tim>-真的吗  -是的
<13-20,Tim>- Really? - Yeah.

<14-7,Ross>-他不能接受吗  -他的反应比你强
