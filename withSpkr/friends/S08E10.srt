4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,690
<1-3,Monica>比我平常买的靴子贵一点  也比租的贵
<1-3,Monica>Now, they're a little more than I usually spend on boots. Or rent.

5
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,080
<1-4,Chandler>我的天啊

9
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,910
<1-7,Monica>专柜小姐的表情像是在说
<1-7,Monica>The saleswoman was looking at me like:

10
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:33,490
<1-7,Monica>"这些靴子大贵了  你买不起"
<1-7,Monica>"These are too expensive for you."

11
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,110
<1-8,Chandler>很有道理
<1-8,Chandler>She had a point.

12

<1-10,Monica>莫妮卡  这双靴子好漂亮哦

18
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:00,490
<1-15,Monica>你会看到的  而且我喜欢听到赞美
<1-15,Monica>You'll see. Besides, I love the compliments.

19
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:03,940
<1-15,Monica>你曾经拥有过美到大家都想拥有的东西吗
<1-15,Monica>Have you ever had something so beautiful, everyone wants it?

00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:54,500
<2-1,Ross>我会一直跟你玩
<2-1,Ross>And I'm gonna play with you all the time.

35
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:58,180
<2-2,Phoebe>你怎么能让他对着你的胯下说话
<2-2,Phoebe>How can you let him talk to your crotch like that?

36
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:05,610
<2-3,Rachel>-他是在跟宝宝说话  -原来如此
<2-3,Rachel>- He's talking to the baby. - Oh! Okay.

37
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,860
<2-4,Phoebe>好吧  因为当他说
<2-4,Phoebe>Okay, because when he said,

38
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,440
<2-4,Phoebe>"我等不及要听到你说第一句话"
<2-4,Phoebe>"I can't wait for your first words"...

39
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,080
<2-4,Phoebe>我想"这招不错"
<2-4,Phoebe>...I thought, "There's a trick."

40
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,250
<2-5,Rachel>我得走了  待会见
<2-5,Rachel>Well, I gotta go, you guys. I'll see you later.

<2-15,Joey>不  她想跟你谈
<2-15,Joey>No, she wants to talk to you.

<3-6,Monica>I'm getting a lot of use out of them already.

88
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,690
<3-6,Monica>真的很实用
<3-6,Monica>They're very practical.

89

<3-6,Monica>可以搭配连衣裙  短裙  长裤
<3-6,Monica>You can wear them with dresses, with skirts, with pants...

00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:29,340
<3-7,Chandler>你可以搭配短裤  站在街角
<3-7,Chandler>You wear them with shorts on the corner

91
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,130
<3-7,Chandler>赚点钱来付靴子的帐单
<3-7,Chandler>and earn the money to pay for them.

92
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:35,560
<3-8,Phoebe>哇  好漂亮
<3-8,Phoebe>Wow, they're beautiful.

93
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,570
<3-9,Rachel>真的很磨脚
<3-9,Rachel>They hurt so much.

94
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:39,920
<3-11,Phoebe>-什么  -做这双靴子的人
<3-11,Phoebe>- What? - The guy who made these...

95
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,670
<3-12,Monica>一定很讨厌脚  想要看着它们死掉
<3-12,Monica>...hates feet and wants to see them die.

96
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,060
<3-13,Rachel>把它们送给我
<3-13,Rachel>Give them to me.

97
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,130
<3-13,Rachel>我的脚好几年没有感觉了
<3-13,Rachel>I haven't felt my feet in years.

98
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,380
<3-14,Monica>不行  我花了大价钱买下来
<3-14,Monica>I can't. I spent so much money on them

99
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,390
<3-14,Monica>我告诉钱德勒我会一直穿着
<3-14,Monica>and I told Chandler I'd wear them all the time.

100
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,760
<3-14,Monica>我不能送人
<3-14,Monica>I can't just give them away.

101
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,920
<3-15,Phoebe>你可以拿去退货换钱
<3-15,Phoebe>Then get your money back and return them.

102
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,070
<3-16,Monica>我也不能那么做
<3-16,Monica>I can't do that either.

103
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:58,300
<3-16,Monica>鞋底的地方有磨损
<3-16,Monica>The soles are already a little scuffed up,

104
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:00,860
<3-16,Monica>内衬沾满了我的血
<3-16,Monica>and the insides are filled with my blood.

105
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,500
<3-19,Ross>我刚刚去学校接了本
<3-19,Ross>Hey, I just picked up Ben from school.

106
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,970
<3-20,Chandler>你的任务还没完成吧
<3-20,Chandler>I don't think you did a very thorough job.

107
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,650
<3-21,Ross>我把他送回卡罗尔家了
<3-21,Ross>I dropped him off at Carol's.

108
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,820
<3-21,Ross>总之  我没有要到门票
<3-21,Ross>Anyway, it turns out I'm not gonna get those tickets, though.

109
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,410
<3-22,Phoebe>不是吧  为什么
<3-22,Phoebe>Oh, no. Why not?

110
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:22,250
<3-23,Ross>结果本跟史汀的儿子处得不好
<3-23,Ross>It turns out Ben and Sting's son do not get along.

111
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,210
<3-24,Phoebe>怎么会呢
<3-24,Phoebe>How come?

112
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:25,900
<3-25,Ross>很明显  史汀的儿子取笑
<3-25,Ross>Apparently, Sting's son made fun of the fact that

113
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,380
<3-25,Ross>本的妈妈们是女同志
<3-25,Ross>Ben's moms are "lesbenims."

114
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,910
<3-26,Phoebe>等一下  如果他们处不好
<3-26,Phoebe>Wait, Ross. If they don't get along,

115
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,580
<3-26,Phoebe>那你应该帮他们劝和
<3-26,Phoebe>then you should smooth things over.

116
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:34,930
<3-26,Phoebe>让他们做好朋友
<3-26,Phoebe>Make them be friends.

117
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:38,170
<3-27,Ross>-你不能逼孩子们做朋友  -当然可以
<3-27,Ross>- Phoebe, you can't force kids to be friends. - Sure you can.

118
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:40,860
<3-28,Phoebe>给他们一些积木  让他们在游戏床里玩
<3-28,Phoebe>Give them some blocks. Put them in a playpen.

119
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:45,000
<3-30,Phoebe>-游戏床  本都七岁了  -七岁了
<3-30,Phoebe>- Playpen? Ben's 7. - Your kid is 7?

120
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:48,540
<3-30,Phoebe>他个头好小哦
<3-30,Phoebe>He's really small.

121
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,970
<3-30,Phoebe>拜托你去要门票
<3-30,Phoebe>Please get the tickets.

122
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:54,410
<3-31,Ross>抱歉  菲比  我办不到
<3-31,Ross>I'm sorry, Pheebs. I just can't do it.

123
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:57,380
<3-32,Phoebe>不  你可以  史汀亲口说过
<3-32,Phoebe>Yes, you can. Sting says so himself.

124
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:00,820
<3-34,Phoebe>-什么  -罗斯可以
<3-34,Phoebe>- What? - Ross can.

125
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:05,020
<3-35,Ross>听着  我很抱歉
<3-35,Ross>Look, I'm sorry...

126
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:08,140
<3-38,Phoebe>罗斯可以
<3-38,Phoebe>Ross can.

127
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:13,880
<3-38,Phoebe>-菲比  -罗斯可以帮我要到门票
<3-38,Phoebe>- Phoebe? - Ross can get me the tickets.

00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,930
<3-38,Phoebe>罗斯可以帮我要到门票

139
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:52,000
<4-9,Rachel>服装界的不同领域
<4-9,Rachel>...that you could get involved in.

140
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:54,520
<4-9,Rachel>让我看看  有设计部门
<4-9,Rachel>Let's see, there's design.

141
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,010
<4-9,Rachel>但那得需要相关文凭
<4-9,Rachel>But you may need a whole other degree for that.

142
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:00,130
<4-9,Rachel>销售部门不错  你可以旅行
<4-9,Rachel>There's sales which is great, because you get to travel.

143
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:01,610
<4-10,Dina>我不在乎流行服装
<4-10,Dina>I don't care about fashion.

<5-3,Monica>-怎么了  -没事  我只是在打哈欠
<5-3,Monica>- What's wrong? - Nothing. I just was yawning.

147
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:41,090
<5-4,Chandler>别忘了今晚我公司要办派对
<5-4,Chandler>Don't forget, my office holiday party's tonight.

148
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,750
<5-5,Monica>我们今晚不一定要去  对吧
<5-5,Monica>Honey, we don't really have to go to this thing, do we?

149
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,730
<5-6,Chandler>我知道你不喜欢参加我公司的派对
<5-6,Chandler>Sweetie, I know that you don't like my office parties,

150
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:48,860
<5-6,Chandler>但你可以穿你的新靴子
<5-6,Chandler>but you can wear your new boots.

151
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:53,910
<5-6,Chandler>看吧  每件事都有它好的一面

<5-7,Monica>-今晚我不想穿靴子  -为什么
<5-7,Monica>- I don't wanna wear the boots tonight. - Why not?

153
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:00,800
<5-8,Chandler>我担心你老板看到以后
<5-8,Chandler>Well, you know. I'm worried your bosses will see them

154
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,930
<5-9,Monica>会觉得他们给你的薪水太高了
<5-9,Monica>and think they pay you too much money.

155
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:06,790
<5-9,Monica>或是你的助理看到以后会要求加薪
<5-9,Monica>Or your assistant will see them and want a raise.

156
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:10,770
<5-10,Chandler>你以为我是在帮靴子订价的公司上班吗
<5-10,Chandler>Do you think I work some kind of boot-pricing company?

157
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,180
<5-11,Monica>我已经挑好了我要穿的衣服
<5-11,Monica>I picked out this outfit I wanna wear,

158
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,870
<5-11,Monica>靴子跟它不配
<5-11,Monica>and the boots don't go with it.

159
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,460
<5-12,Chandler>你说过这双靴子物有所值
<5-12,Chandler>You said that you paid all that money

160
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:19,990
<5-12,Chandler>因为可以搭配短裙  连衣裙跟长裤
<5-12,Chandler>because those boots go with skirts, dresses, and pants!

161
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:22,860
<5-13,Monica>好吧  你要我穿靴子我就穿嘛
<5-13,Monica>Fine. If you want me to, I'll wear the boots.

162
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:26,410
<5-13,Monica>事实上我要到卧室去试穿我的衣服
<5-13,Monica>In fact, I'll go into my room right now and try the outfit on.

<6-2,Rachel>他一直都非常支持我
<6-2,Rachel>He has been incredibly supportive of me.

167
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:49,070
<6-2,Rachel>如果他大发脾气
<6-2,Rachel>And if he gets a little upset,

168
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,120
<6-2,Rachel>快把肉饼赛百味三明治拿给他
<6-2,Rachel>that's what the meatball sub is for.

<6-6,Rachel>- What's wrong? - Why don't you sit down.

172
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,460
<6-6,Rachel>蒂娜有件事想告诉你
<6-6,Rachel>Dina has something that she wants to tell you.

173
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:12,330
<6-7,Joey>发生了什么事  是妈妈吗  她生病了吗
<6-7,Joey>What's going on? Is it Mom? Is she sick?

174
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,220
<6-7,Joey>是爸爸的心脏出问题了吗
<6-7,Joey>Is it Dad's heart?

175
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:16,270
<6-9,Joey>那是三明治吗
<6-9,Joey>Is that a sandwich?

176
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,730
<6-8,Dina>-妈妈跟爸爸没事  -那是三明治吗
<6-8,Dina>- Joe, Mom and Dad are fine. - Is that a sandwich?!

<6-10,Rachel>乔伊  有件事你得知道
<6-10,Rachel>Joey, there's something that you should know.

178
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:28,950
<6-10,Rachel>蒂娜
<6-10,Rachel>Dina?

00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:34,930
<6-11,Dina>-我怀孕了  -什么

<6-13,Rachel>快给他三明治  给他三明治
<6-13,Rachel>Now. Give him the sandwich! Give him the sandwich!

181
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,900
<6-14,Joey>很明显  这是个误会  你不可能怀孕
<6-14,Joey>Obviously, this is a mistake. You can't be pregnant.

182
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,350
<6-14,Joey>因为你得先做爱才会怀孕
<6-14,Joey>Because you have to have sex to get pregnant.

183
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:49,080
<6-15,Dina>乔伊  我试着学你一样等到25岁再尝禁果
<6-15,Dina>Joe, I tried to wait until I was 25, like you did.

<6-17,Joey>我不敢相信  你是个好孩子
<6-17,Joey>I can't believe this. You're the good one.

186
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,790
<6-17,Joey>你念过大学  还念了两年
<6-17,Joey>You went to college! Both years!

187
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,530
<6-17,Joey>是谁干的
<6-17,Joey>Who did this to you?

188
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:08,140
<6-18,Dina>巴比·科索  但他是个很好的人
<6-18,Dina>Bobby Corso. But he's a real nice guy.

<6-18,Dina>我很喜欢他  他很好笑
<6-18,Dina>I like him a lot. He's real funny.

190
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,980
<6-19,Joey>你因为"好笑"而怀孕
<6-19,Joey>You got pregnant for "funny"?

191
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:17,040
<6-19,Joey>蒂娜  如果他很好笑  你只要笑就行了
<6-19,Joey>Dina, if he's funny, laugh!

193
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:22,850
<6-20,Dina>为什么  你要去哪里
<6-20,Dina>Why? Where you going?

194
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:24,900
<6-21,Joey>我现在没法直视你
<6-21,Joey>I can't look at you right now.

195
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:30,800
<6-21,Joey>我知道

<7-3,Phoebe>好好地谈一谈  把问题解决掉

<8-8,Monica>- These boots were a huge mistake. - What?

243
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,910
<8-10,Monica>你说得对  我不该买下来
<8-10,Monica>Okay, you were right. I never should have bought them.

244
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:09,690
<8-10,Monica>害我的脚好痛  我的脚趾快断了
<8-10,Monica>They're killing me, one toe at a time.

245
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:12,510
<8-11,Chandler>我说得对  原来"对了"就是这种感觉
<8-11,Chandler>So I was right. This is what it feels like to be right.

246
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:16,340
<8-11,Chandler>我为什么觉得很不安
<8-11,Chandler>It's oddly unsettling.

247
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,680
<8-12,Monica>我们要怎么回家  背着走吧
<8-12,Monica>How are we gonna we get home? Maybe a piggyback ride?

248
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,890
<8-13,Chandler>-来吧  -好吧  等一下
<8-13,Chandler>- Hop on. - Okay, wait, just give me a second.

249
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:24,870
<8-14,Monica>我先把靴子脱掉
<8-14,Monica>Let me just get my boots off first.

250
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:32,710
<8-14,Monica>天啊
<8-14,Monica>Oh, God.

251
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,590
<8-15,Chandler>亲爱的  我知道你很痛
<8-15,Chandler>Honey, I know you're in pain right now,

252
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,270
<8-15,Chandler>但我却来了性致
<8-15,Chandler>but I'm a little turned-on.

253
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,780
<9-1,Dina>你会不会担心走路的时候
<9-1,Dina>Do you ever worry that you'll be walking

254
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:51,090
<9-1,Dina>宝宝会掉出来
<9-1,Dina>and your baby will just slip out?

255
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,870
<9-2,Rachel>你念的哪所大学  蒂娜
<9-2,Rachel>What college was that, Dina?

256
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,770
<9-3,Dina>天啊  巴比
<9-3,Dina>Oh, my God. Bobby?

257
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,960
<9-4,Bobby>蒂娜  很高兴能见到你
<9-4,Bobby>Hi, Dina. Good to see you.

258
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,070
<9-5,Rachel>乔伊  你在做什么
<9-5,Rachel>Joey, what are you doing?

259
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:07,920
<9-6,Joey>我只是在做我该做的事
<9-6,Joey>Just what needs to be done.

260
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:12,370
<9-6,Joey>亲爱的亲友们  我们齐聚一堂
<9-6,Joey>Dearly beloved, we're gathered here...

261
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,940
<9-7,Rachel>乔伊  这太疯狂了
<9-7,Rachel>Joey, this is crazy.

262
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:16,340
<9-8,Joey>我在跟上帝说话  别打断我
<9-8,Joey>Don't interrupt me when I'm talking to God!

263
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,420
<9-8,Joey>我们说到哪里了
<9-8,Joey>Where were we?

264
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:21,370
<9-8,Joey>-你  蒂娜  愿意嫁这个人...  -不
<9-8,Joey>- Right, okay. Do you Dina take this man...? - No!

265
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:23,200
<9-11,Dina>-你得嫁他  -不  我不会嫁
<9-11,Dina>- You'll take him. - No, I won't!

266
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,560
<9-12,Joey>-这可由不得你  -不  我就愿意这样
<9-12,Joey>- You don't get a say in this. - Yes, I do.

267
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,320
<9-13,Dina>我听到了"我愿意"  已经完成一半
<9-13,Dina>I heard "I do." We're halfway there.

268
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,920
<9-14,Joey>再来是你
<9-14,Joey>Okay. You.

269
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:31,160
<9-15,Rachel>好吧  乔伊  够了
<9-15,Rachel>All right, Joey, that is enough!

270
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,480
<9-15,Rachel>虽然这个婚礼既漂亮又温馨
<9-15,Rachel>Listen. As beautiful and moving as this ceremony is,

271
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,770
<9-15,Rachel>这是不合法的
<9-15,Rachel>this is not legal.

272
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:36,620
<9-15,Rachel>他们没有结婚证书
<9-15,Rachel>Okay. They don't have a marriage license

273
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,640
<9-15,Rachel>也没有证婚人
<9-15,Rachel>and they don't have any witnesses,

274
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,500
<9-15,Rachel>而且新郎只穿了一只鞋
<9-15,Rachel>and the groom only has one shoe.

275
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,580
<9-16,Bobby>对  他把另一只鞋脱了  用来打我
<9-16,Bobby>Yeah, he took the other one off and hit me with it.

276
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,030
<9-17,Joey>我该怎么办
<9-17,Joey>What am I supposed to do?

277
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:49,350
<9-18,Rachel>你应该了解他们是成年人
<9-18,Rachel>You're supposed to realize they are adults

278
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:51,370
<9-18,Rachel>可以自己做决定
<9-18,Rachel>and that can make their own decisions.

279
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:54,610
<9-19,Joey>不  他们不能  他们笨到让自己怀孕
<9-19,Joey>No, they can't. They were stupid enough to get knocked up!

280
00:14:56,910 --> 00:15:00,940
<9-20,Rachel>预防措施不一定有效对吧
<9-20,Rachel>Contraceptives are not always effective. Right?

281
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,400
<9-21,Bobby>对  我们没有做预防措施
<9-21,Bobby>Yeah. We kind of didn't use any.

282
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,660
<9-22,Rachel>孩子们  别帮倒忙了
<9-22,Rachel>Come on, kids, a little help here!

283
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,860
<10-1,Phoebe>这个地方真的很棒
<10-1,Phoebe>Wow! This place is incredible!

284
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:19,480
<10-1,Phoebe>史汀的笔...
<10-1,Phoebe>Sting's pen...

285
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:22,430
<10-1,Phoebe>他送给了菲比
<10-1,Phoebe>...that he gave to Phoebe.

286
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,960
<10-1,Phoebe>来吧  秘密通道
<10-1,Phoebe>Come on, secret passageway.

287
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:38,420
<10-6,Trudie Styler>我是楚蒂  你一定是本的妈妈
<10-6,Trudie Styler>I'm Trudie. You must be Ben's mum.

288
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,690
<10-7,Phoebe>不然我为什么要到这里来呢
<10-7,Phoebe>Why else would I be here?

289
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:42,990
<10-9,Phoebe>请坐
<10-9,Phoebe>Why don't you sit down.

290
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:46,350
<10-10,Trudie Styler>我知道杰克跟本最近处得不太好
<10-10,Trudie Styler>I gather Jack and Ben haven't been getting along lately.

291
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:49,100
<10-11,Phoebe>我相信这个故事一定有两面说法
<10-11,Phoebe>I'm sure there are two sides to this story.

292
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:52,750
<10-12,Trudie Styler>但我听到的是本是个"大笨蛋"
<10-12,Trudie Styler>But all I've heard is that Ben's a bit of a "poo-poo-head."

293
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:56,580
<10-13,Phoebe>抱歉  杰克的爸爸不会来吗
<10-13,Phoebe>I'm sorry, won't Jack's father be joining us?

294
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:59,100
<10-14,Trudie Styler>对不起  杰克的爸爸没空
<10-14,Trudie Styler>Well, I'm sorry. Jack's father's not available.

295
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:03,690
<10-15,Phoebe>好吧  我们可以改约到周五晚上
<10-15,Phoebe>Okay. Well, then, could we reschedule for Friday night,

296
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:05,230
<10-15,Phoebe>八点见行吗
<10-15,Phoebe>perhaps at 8:00?

297
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,710
<10-16,Trudie Styler>不  那样行不通
<10-16,Trudie Styler>No, I know that wouldn't work.

298
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:07,900
<10-16,Trudie Styler>我丈夫要办演唱会
<10-16,Trudie Styler>My husband's in concert.

299
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,860
<10-17,Phoebe>演唱会
<10-17,Phoebe>Concert. Yeah.

300
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:13,770
<10-17,Phoebe>这让问题变得有点棘手
<10-17,Phoebe>That does put us in quite a pickle.

301
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,200
<10-17,Phoebe>演唱会前后我都有事
<10-17,Phoebe>Because you see I'm busy before and after the concert,

302
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:19,160
<10-17,Phoebe>演唱会的时间他又很忙
<10-17,Phoebe>and he's obviously busy during.

303
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,660
<10-18,Trudie Styler>我想你跟我现在该来谈谈杰克跟本的事
<10-18,Trudie Styler>So I guess you and I should talk about Jack and Ben right now.

304
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:25,530
<10-19,Phoebe>除非...
<10-19,Phoebe>Unless... Unless...

305
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:29,500
<10-19,Phoebe>我愿意到演唱会上...
<10-19,Phoebe>Okay, I would be willing to go to the concert...

306
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:33,420
<10-19,Phoebe>想一想孩子们的事
<10-19,Phoebe>...all the while thinking about the children, of course.

307
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,720
<10-20,Trudie Styler>你是来要票的吗
<10-20,Trudie Styler>Are you here for tickets?

308
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:38,140
<10-21,Phoebe>谢谢  四张就够了
<10-21,Phoebe>Thank you. Four would be great.

309
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,530
<10-22,Trudie Styler>我不会把演唱会门票
<10-22,Trudie Styler>I'm not giving concert tickets

310
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:43,300
<10-22,Trudie Styler>送给这样利用自己孩子的人
<10-22,Trudie Styler>to someone who'd use their son like this.

311
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:46,210
<10-23,Phoebe>那正好  本不是我的儿子
<10-23,Phoebe>Then you're in luck. Ben's not my son.

312
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:50,680
<10-24,Trudie Styler>听着  我已经按下了静声警铃
<10-24,Trudie Styler>Look, I've just pressed a button triggering a silent alarm.

313
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,870
<10-24,Trudie Styler>警察随时会到
<10-24,Trudie Styler>Any minute now, the police will be here.

315
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,900
<10-25,Phoebe>"警察乐队"要来
<10-25,Phoebe>The Police? Here?

316
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:56,820
<10-25,Phoebe>他们要复合了
<10-25,Phoebe>A reunion?

00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,340
<11-4,Monica>是棕黄色的同款靴子
<11-4,Monica>My boots in tan!

321
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:18,280
<11-4,Monica>你能靠近一点  让我看看价钱吗
<11-4,Monica>Can you get a little closer so I see the price?

322
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:22,220
<11-5,Chandler>我在这里就看到了 它会害你丢掉一个老公
<11-5,Chandler>I can see it from right here. It'll cost you one husband.

323
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,430
<11-6,Monica>抱歉  我可以自己走了
<11-6,Monica>I'm sorry. I can walk the rest of the way now.

324
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:27,180
<11-6,Monica>把我的靴子还给我
<11-6,Monica>Just give me my boots.

325
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,430
<11-7,Chandler>我没有拿你的靴子
<11-7,Chandler>I don't have your boots.

327
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,250
<11-9,Chandler>你为什么不去看看鞍囊里有没有
<11-9,Chandler>Why don't you check in one of my saddlebags

328
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:37,160

337
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,030
<12-1,Rachel>不代表这就是件坏事
<12-1,Rachel>doesn't mean this is gonna be a disaster.

338
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,660
<12-1,Rachel>或许他们有计划

350
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:52,290
<12-8,Joey>蒂娜  如果你要生孩子  你应该结婚
<12-8,Joey>Dina, if you're having a baby, you should be married.

351
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:56,360
<12-8,Joey>即使是嫁给巴比  我不是在夸奖你
<12-8,Joey>Even if it is to Bobby. Dude, that's not a compliment.

352
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,960
<12-9,Dina>乔伊  我就知道你不会支持我
<12-9,Dina>Joey, I knew you wouldn't be supportive.
