176
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:57,030
<7-6,Chandler>那些死机器人  它们应该是人类忠实的仆人
<7-6,Chandler>Damn those robots. They're supposed to be our faithful servants!

177
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:01,070
<7-7,Joey>总之不是机器人  是操作它的人

<11-3,Joey>我一直听说我会被换掉
<11-3,Joey>Okay? l keep hearing rumors that l might get fired.

259
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:27,460
<11-3,Joey>他们还找人来试我这个角色
<11-3,Joey>Okay, they even have actors coming in to read for my part!

<11-3,Joey>好吧  难怪你不让我碰他  拿去吧
<11-3,Joey>OK. That's why you didn't want me to touch him, right? Here you go.

<11-3,Joey>我真是白痴  真是的

<11-3,Joey>你好吗
<11-3,Joey>Hey, how are you doing?

265
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:55,320
<12-1,Rachel>我的高中毕业舞会舞伴似乎放我鸽子
<12-1,Rachel>So it seemed that my prom date had stood me up.

266
00:14:55,730 --> 00:15:00,190
<12-1,Rachel>罗斯义不容辞地站了出来
<12-1,Rachel>So Ross selflessly offered to take me.

267
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,560
<12-2,Elizabeth>好感人喔
<12-2,Elizabeth>What a nice story.

268
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,390
<12-3,Paul>罗斯上大学时
<12-3,Paul>So Ross was in college...

269
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,970
<12-3,Paul>想趁虚而入
<12-3,Paul>...and decided to jump at the chance

270
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:09,270
<12-3,Paul>带一名少女参加高中舞会
<12-3,Paul>to take a young girl to her high school prom.

271
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,600
<12-4,Rachel>想不到会有这种反效果
<12-4,Rachel>l definitely did not see that one backfiring.

272
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:18,550
<12-5,Ross>-我去洗手间  -你慢慢上
<12-5,Ross>- l'm going to the bathroom. - Take your time.

273
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:23,420
<12-6,Ross>其实我是大一  她是高三
<12-6,Ross>l was a freshman and she was a senior.

274
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,020
<12-6,Ross>所以没有差很多...
<12-6,Ross>So it wasn't as bad as...

275
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:28,420
<12-7,Paul>罗斯  我知道我一直找你麻烦
<12-7,Paul>Look. l know l've been giving you a lot of jabs.

276
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,630
<12-7,Paul>是因为我爱女心切
<12-7,Paul>lt's partly because l'm very protective of Lizzie...

277
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:38,290
<12-7,Paul>而且你的丑事一件接一件
<12-7,Paul>...and partly because they just keep coming to me.

278
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:43,110
<12-7,Paul>我必须承认  丽莎一直夸你
<12-7,Paul>l admit after all the wonderful things Lizzie told me...

279
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:47,800
<12-7,Paul>瑞秋又说了那么那么那么多事
<12-7,Paul>...and the many, many, many stories that Rachel has told me...

280
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:50,910
<12-7,Paul>看来
<12-7,Paul>...well...

281
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,050
<12-8,Ross>你也...没
<12-8,Ross>...you're not...

282
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,980
<12-8,Ross>那么糟
<12-8,Ross>...all bad.

283
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,820
<12-8,Ross>是没那么糟
<12-8,Ross>"Not all bad. "

284
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:03,920
<12-9,Paul>很抱歉之前对你那么凶  你必须知道
<12-9,Paul>l'm sorry l was so harsh before. But you have to understand.

285
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:08,070
<12-9,Paul>丽莎在我眼中仍是个12岁小女孩
<12-9,Paul>l still look at Lizzie like she's a 12-year-old girl.

286
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,260
<12-10,Ross>我懂你的意思  我也有深有同感
<12-10,Ross>Yeah. You know what, I know what you mean. l do that too.

287
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:15,440
<12-11,Paul>你说什么
<12-11,Paul>l beg your pardon?

288
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,440
<12-12,Ross>不不不  我不是把她当成12岁的小女孩
<12-12,Ross>No! No! Not—I don’t mean I-I see her as a twelve-year-old girl!

289
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:21,400
<12-13,Paul>我是说我有个六岁的儿子
<12-13,Paul>l mean, l have a son who is 6

290
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,420
<12-12,Ross>在我眼中  他仍是个小宝宝
<12-12,Ross>and l still think of him as a baby.

291
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:28,150
<12-14,Ross>-你有儿子啊  -对  我和前妻有共同监护权
<12-14,Ross>- A son? - My ex-wife and l share custody of Ben.

<12-14,Ross>还有  卡萝尔和我的关系很好
<12-14,Ross>Just to let you know, Carol and l are on excellent terms...

293

296
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:41,790
<12-15,Paul>没事  我只是不知道你结过婚
<12-15,Paul>Don't worry. l didn't realize you were married.

297
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,650
<12-16,Rachel>我们是结过婚  那只是...
<12-16,Rachel>We were. But that was just a....

298
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:51,930
<12-16,Rachel>那只是酒后的大错误
<12-16,Rachel>I mean that was just a big drunken mistake.

<13-4,Chandler>我们约七点  不要约六点
<13-4,Chandler>"Let's meet at 7:00, not at 6:00."

308

<14-18,Joey>You-you can teach it! I’ll show you right how to do it.

352
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,750
<15-1,Rachel>其实我在想
<15-1,Rachel>I mean, if you think about it...

353
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:59,210
<15-1,Rachel>罗斯每次结婚  都学到一点东西
<15-1,Rachel>...Ross did learn something from each marriage.

354
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:02,200
<15-2,Paul>学到如何让婚姻变得更短吗
<15-2,Paul>How to make the next one even shorter?

355
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,180
<15-2,Paul>等等  这么说不公平
<15-2,Paul>Wait a minute. That's not fair.

356
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:07,320
<15-3,Rachel>他和我的婚姻  比跟艾米丽的婚姻长多了
<15-3,Rachel>He was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was to Emily.

357
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,150
<15-3,Rachel>只是他没告诉我
<15-3,Rachel>He just didn't tell me.

358
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,350
<15-3,Rachel>我再撒一次尿好了
<15-3,Rachel>Maybe l have to pee again.

359
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,720
<15-4,Paul>真有意思
<15-4,Paul>Well, this is fun.

360
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:26,630
<15-4,Paul>罗斯  有哪个老婆被你杀了吗
<15-4,Paul>So, Ross, did you kill any of these wives?

361
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:30,370
<15-5,Ross>你知道吗   我受够了
<15-5,Ross>l have had enough of this!

362
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:33,420
<15-5,Ross>我很喜欢你的女儿
<15-5,Ross>You know, l care a great deal about your daughter.

363
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:35,790
<15-5,Ross>我一直很尊重她
<15-5,Ross>and I have treated her with nothing but respect!

364
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:38,370
<15-5,Ross>要是你对我有意见  说实话...
<15-5,Ross>So if you've got a problem with me...frankly…

365
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,330
<15-6,Paul>-你在吼我吗  -绝对没有
<15-6,Paul>- Are you yelling at me? - God, no.

366
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,260
<15-7,Ross>爸  如果你不喜欢罗斯  也无所谓
<15-7,Ross>You know what? Daddy. lf you don't like Ross, that's fine.

367
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:49,900
<15-8,Elizabeth>我不管  我还是要跟他交往
<15-8,Elizabeth>lt doesn't matter to me. l'm going out with him anyway.

368
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,070
<15-9,Paul>真的吗
<15-9,Paul>Really?

369
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,640
<15-10,Ross>要是她不管
<15-10,Ross>Well, if it doesn't matter to her...

370
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:58,780
<15-10,Ross>那我也不管  这也不是吼你喔
<15-10,Ross>...it doesn't matter to me. Still not yelling.

371
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,920
<15-11,Paul>那就没办法了
<15-11,Paul>What can l say?

372
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,360
<15-11,Paul>但我还是不欣赏你
<15-11,Paul>This doesn't make me like you any better!

373
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:12,180
<15-12,Ross>没关系  我也不太喜欢我自己
<15-12,Ross>That’s okay, I’m not so crazy about myself right now either.

374
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:14,790
<15-13,Paul>-我们达成共识了吗  -对吧
<15-13,Paul>- Then we agree? - Yeah. l guess so.

375
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:17,620
<15-15,Paul>-我们没有人喜欢罗斯  -我喜欢罗斯
<15-15,Paul>- Neither of us like Ross. - l like Ross.

376
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:20,090
<15-16,Elizabeth>小孩子
<15-16,Elizabeth>Kids!

377
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:25,160
<15-18,Rachel>等等  我又想到罗斯人很好的实例了
<15-18,Rachel>Wait, wait. l just thought of a story about how nice Ross is.

378
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,790
<15-19,Ross>没关系  瑞秋  我们现在不喜欢罗斯
<15-19,Ross>That's okay. Rach. We're not liking Ross right now.
