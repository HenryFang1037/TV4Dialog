1
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,260
<1-1,Phoebe>噢  嘿  你们大家
<1-1,Phoebe>Oh,hey,you guys?

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:07,020
<1-1,Phoebe>我生日当天晚上订不到餐厅
<1-1,Phoebe>I couldn't get a reservation for the night of my birthday..

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:09,350
<1-1,Phoebe>所以我们要改到星期四晚上
<1-1,Phoebe>so we'll have to do dinner Thursday night instead.

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:12,700
<1-2,Joey>星期四  但那是万圣节耶
<1-2,Joey>Thursday? But that's Halloween.

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:13,800
<1-3,Phoebe>那又怎样
<1-3,Phoebe>So?

6
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:16,960
<1-4,Joey>只不过是很诡异而已
<1-4,Joey>It's just spooky,that's all.

7
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:19,960
<1-5,Ross>那  麦克也会跟我们吃晚餐吗
<1-5,Ross>So,is Mike coming to dinner?

8
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,400
<1-6,Phoebe>不会  我第一次可以跟男朋友过生日
<1-6,Phoebe>No. It's my first birthday with a boyfriend,

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,970
<1-6,Phoebe>他却要上班
<1-6,Phoebe>and he has to work.

10
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,450
<1-6,Phoebe>我很想对他发脾气
<1-6,Phoebe>I'd get mad at him,

11
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,900
<1-6,Phoebe>但是我想这会太快露出我的本性
<1-6,Phoebe>but I think it's too soon to show my true colors.

12
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:31,770
<1-7,Rachel>菲比  你只预定5个人的餐位就可以了
<1-7,Rachel>Oh phobs, I would make the reservation for five.

13
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:33,840
<1-7,Rachel>我们其中一个要留下来照顾艾玛
<1-7,Rachel>Because one of us has to stay with Emma.

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,580
<1-7,Rachel>-我们俩应该谁去呢  -瑞秋
<1-7,Rachel>- Which one of us should go to dinner? - Rachel!

15
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,170
<1-9,Ross>事实上  我想或许我们两个都可以去
<1-9,Ross>Actually,I was thinking maybe both of us could go.

16
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:43,110
<1-10,Phoebe>哦  真好
<1-10,Phoebe>Oh, yeah

<1-11,Ross>谢谢  我会多用点心准备你的礼物
<1-11,Ross>Thanks. I'll put a lot of extra thought into your gift.

18
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:51,260
<1-12,Phoebe>好了  太棒了  我们全部都可以去
<1-12,Phoebe>All right,so great,we can all go now.

19
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,530
<1-12,Phoebe>真棒  你们知道吗
<1-12,Phoebe>That is fun! Hey! You know what?

20
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:58,080
<1-12,Phoebe>我们六个人已经很久没有这样在一起了
<1-12,Phoebe>We all haven't been together,the six of us,in such a long time.

21
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,250
<1-13,Monica>你在说什么呢
<1-13,Monica>What are you talking about?

22
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,450
<1-13,Monica>我们现在就在一起啊
<1-13,Monica>We're together now.

23
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,250
<1-14,Rachel>莫妮  钱德勒并不在这里
<1-14,Rachel>Mon? Chandler's not here.

24
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:08,230
<1-15,Monica>噢  老天
<1-15,Monica>Oh,dear God.

<2-1,Chandler>大家好  很高兴第一次我们全员到齐
<2-1,Chandler>Hello. It's nice to see our team together for the first time.

38
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,100
<2-1,Chandler>现在  在我们开始之前
<2-1,Chandler>Now,before we get started,

39
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,420
<2-1,Chandler>有什么问题要问吗
<2-1,Chandler>are there any questions?

40
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,570
<2-1,Chandler>-很好  肯  对吧  -没错
<2-1,Chandler>- Yes. Ken,is it? - That's right.

41
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:00,230
<2-2,Ken>有传闻说你之所以会来塔尔萨
<2-2,Ken>Is it true the reason you're in Tulsa is,

42
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:01,610
<2-2,Ken>是因为你在开会的时候睡着
<2-2,Ken>you fell asleep in a meeting..

43
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:02,350
<2-2,Ken>然后随口接下此份工作
<2-2,Ken>and took the job

44
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:04,440
<2-2,Ken>其实你根本搞不清是来干什么的  对吧
<2-2,Ken>without realizing what you were saying yes to?

45
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:09,350
<2-3,Chandler>别道听途说  肯
<2-3,Chandler>Well,don't believe everything you hear,Ken.

46
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,080
<2-3,Chandler>但是没错  那是真的
<2-3,Chandler>But yeah,that's true.

47
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,270
<2-3,Chandler>好了  我们先开始
<2-3,Chandler>All right,let's get started

48
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:16,720
<2-3,Chandler>看一下上一季的数字
<2-3,Chandler>by taking a look at last quarter's figures.

49
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,120
<2-3,Chandler>克劳蒂亚  你该先
<2-3,Chandler>Claudia,aren't you supposed

50
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,930
<2-3,Chandler>问一下老板可不可以抽烟吧
<2-3,Chandler>to blow smoke up the boss's ass?

51
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,100
<2-4,Claudia>我很抱歉  你介意我抽烟吗
<2-4,Claudia>I'm sorry. Does the smoke bother you?

52
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:29,050
<2-5,Chandler>不  我抽了好多年  然后戒了
<2-5,Chandler>No. I smoked for years. Then I quit.

53
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,640
<2-5,Chandler>现在也忘了为什么要戒
<2-5,Chandler>Right now,I can't remember why.

54
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,740
<2-5,Chandler>在办公室不准抽烟的  不是吗
<2-5,Chandler>You're not allowed to smoke in this office,right?

55
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:36,350
<2-6,Claudia>可以的  在奥克拉荷马
<2-6,Claudia>Yes,in Oklahoma

56
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:39,540
<2-6,Claudia>在15人以下的办公室抽烟是合法的
<2-6,Claudia>it's legal to smoke in offices with 15 people or less.

57
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:40,410
<2-6,Claudia>你要来一根吗
<2-6,Claudia>Would you like one?

58
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,860
<2-7,Chandler>好了  听着  我戒烟了
<2-7,Chandler>All right,look. I don't smoke anymore.

59
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,280
<2-7,Chandler>如果你们其他人也想抽
<2-7,Chandler>But if the rest of you want to light up,

60
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,130
<2-7,Chandler>请便  没关系的
<2-7,Chandler>go ahead,it's fine.

61
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:51,950
<2-7,Chandler>原来你们全部都抽烟
<2-7,Chandler>So,you all smoke,then?

62
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,160
<2-7,Chandler>其实  我不抽烟反而看起来很没礼貌
<2-7,Chandler>You know,it's almost rude that I'm not smoking.

63
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,110
<2-8,Ken>没那回事  如果你不想
<2-8,Ken>That's not true. If you don't want..

64
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,340
<2-9,Chandler>肯  拜托
<2-9,Chandler>Ken,please!

65
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,790
<2-9,Chandler>不  不行  我不能抽烟
<2-9,Chandler>No,I can't. I can't smoke.

66
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,290
<2-9,Chandler>如果我抽烟  我老婆会杀了我
<2-9,Chandler>If I smoke,my wife would kill me.

67
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:07,720
<2-10,Ken>不好意思  但你老婆不是在纽约吗
<2-10,Ken>I'm sorry,but isn't your wife back in New York?

68
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,670
<2-11,Chandler>我一直都很喜欢你  肯
<2-11,Chandler>I've always liked you,Ken.

69
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:19,200
<3-1,Phoebe>不给糖就捣蛋
<3-1,Phoebe>Trick or treat.

70
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,580
<3-3,Phoebe>-嘿  -真是大饱眼福呀
<3-3,Phoebe>- Hey. - And "treat" it is.

71
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:28,580
<3-5,Phoebe>哇  幸好我有换衣服
<3-5,Phoebe>Wow. So glad I changed.

72
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,480
<3-5,Phoebe>我差一点就穿上那件
<3-5,Phoebe>I almost wore my threadbare robe

73
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,430
<3-5,Phoebe>连胸部都遮不住的破睡袍
<3-5,Phoebe>that can't contain my breasts.

74
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,890
<3-6,Monica>我不是要穿这件出门  我正在排卵
<3-6,Monica>This is not what I'm wearing. I'm ovulating..

75
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:39,220
<3-6,Monica>而钱德勒很快就回来了
<3-6,Monica>and Chandler's gonna be home.

76
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,900
<3-6,Monica>所以我觉得可以在晚餐前尝试受孕
<3-6,Monica>So,I thought we would try before dinner.

77
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,830
<3-7,Phoebe>等一下  这表示你们会迟到吗
<3-7,Phoebe>Wait,does this mean you'll be late?

78
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:45,900
<3-8,Monica>相信我  钱德勒和我
<3-8,Monica>Believe me, Chandler and I

<3-8,Monica>haven't seen each other in over a week.

80
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:48,810
<3-8,Monica>我们可能会是第一个到的
<3-8,Monica>We'll probably be the first ones there.

81
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,530
<3-9,Phoebe>好了  待会见  祝你们搞的愉快
<3-9,Phoebe>Okay. See you there. Happy humping.

82
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:58,960
<3-9,Phoebe>哇  有人在这里抽烟吗
<3-9,Phoebe>Wow,somebody smoked out here?

83
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,440
<3-9,Phoebe>天啊  难道他们不知道
<3-9,Phoebe>My God,don't people know

84
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,950
<3-9,Phoebe>在公共场所是不可以抽烟的吗
<3-9,Phoebe>you're not allowed to smoke in public spaces?

85
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,220

<7-15,Ross>而老鹰却误认为那是个攻击的行动
<7-15,Ross>The eagle,however,misconstrues this as an act of aggression..

299

301
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,000
<10-3,Rachel>我了解  分离是很煎熬的
<10-3,Rachel>I understand. Separation is hard.

302
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:40,160
<10-3,Rachel>有一次我要离开罗斯去美容院
<10-3,Rachel>One time I was about to leave Ross to go to the beauty parlor.

303
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,240
<10-3,Rachel>他就变得很不开心  他把衣服脱光
<10-3,Rachel>And he got so upset he took off all his clothes..

304
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,220
<10-4,Ross>把小鸡鸡夹在双腿间
<10-4,Ross>tucked his willy between his legs..

305
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:47,790
<10-4,Ross>然后哭喊
<10-4,Ross>and cried out,

306
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:51,220
<10-4,Ross>"妈咪  我是女生 带我跟你去"
<10-4,Ross>"Mommy,I'm a girl. Take me with you."

307
00:14:58,870 --> 00:14:59,940
<10-4,Ross>然而  时光飞逝
<10-4,Ross>Somehow,over time,

308
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:03,140
<10-4,Ross>现在跟你分开已经变得容易很多了

312
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:18,840
<11-4,Monica>我对你抽烟的事还是很生气

313
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,060
<11-5,Chandler>但你说你已经原谅我了
<11-5,Chandler>But you said you forgave me.

314
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,700
<11-5,Chandler>只不过是几根烟  没什么大不了的
<11-5,Chandler>It was just a couple of cigarettes,no big deal.

315
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,420
<11-6,Monica>我那样说是因为我正在排卵
<11-6,Monica>I just said that because I was ovulating

316
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,190
<11-7,Chandler>而你却说
<11-7,Chandler>and you said

317
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:28,960
<11-8,Monica>如果我们在吵架  你是不会跟我做爱的
<11-8,Monica>you wouldn't have sex if we were fighting.

<12-30,Monica>-你们去哪了  -我们刚刚在吵架
<12-30,Monica>- Where have you been? - Well,we had a little fight.

00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,850
<12-31,Chandler>我怎样都不会骗人上床
<12-31,Chandler>I would never lie to get someone into bed.

366
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:41,620
<12-32,Monica>你曾经骗过女生你是肯尼迪家族的人
<12-32,Monica>You used to tell girls you were a Kennedy.

00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,600
<12-32,Monica>谢谢

369
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,390
<12-32,Monica>有点挤  不是吗
<12-32,Monica>A little tight,isn't it?

370
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:53,990
<12-32,Monica>你为什么不订大一点的桌子呢
<12-32,Monica>Why didn't you get a bigger table?

371
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:59,470
<12-32,Monica>你有订  但他们要你换桌
<12-32,Monica>You had a big table but they made you move.

372
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:00,750
<12-32,Monica>闭嘴  莫妮卡
<12-32,Monica>Shut up,Monica.

373
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,910
<12-33,Chandler>我觉得钱德勒应该想点"烟"熏鸭肉
<12-33,Chandler>Oh,well,I suppose that Chandler will have the smoked duck.

374
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:13,430
<12-33,Chandler>而我想莫妮卡应该想点酥"诈"鼠肉
<12-33,Chandler>And I suppose that Monica will have the manipulative shrew.

375
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:15,490
<12-34,Waiter>我再让你们考虑一下
<12-34,Waiter>I'll give you another minute.

377
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,160
<12-35,Joey>他说她想要鼠肉的
<12-35,Joey>He said she wanted the shrew!

378
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,270
<12-36,Ross>瑞秋  别这样  艾玛没事的
<12-36,Ross>Rach,come on,Emma's fine.

379
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,660
<12-36,Ross>你已经变成过份关心的母亲了
<12-36,Ross>You're turning into an obsessive mother,okay?

380
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,820
<12-36,Ross>你要停止这样
<12-36,Ross>You need to stop.

00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:31,740
<12-37,Rachel>去美容院的故事吗
<12-37,Rachel>went to the beauty salon?

383
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,910
<12-38,Chandler>你是说小鸡鸡的事吗
<12-38,Chandler>You mean the willy story?

<12-41,Joey>我已经告诉服务生他们要点什么了
<12-41,Joey>I already told the waiter what they want.

388
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:49,190
<12-42,Monica>你为什么那样做呢
<12-42,Monica>Why would you do that?

389
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:51,370
<12-43,Joey>钱德勒  控制一下你的女人
<12-43,Joey>Chandler,control your woman.

<12-44,Rachel>I would like to start the celebration

392
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:00,910
<12-44,Rachel>先敬菲比一杯
<12-44,Rachel>and make a toast to Phoebe.

393
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:06,140
<12-46,Rachel>-她袜子掉了  -什么
<12-46,Rachel>- She dropped her sock. - What?

<12-47,Monica>她告诉我她出城了
<12-47,Monica>She told me she was out of town.

397
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,920
<12-48,Rachel>她还是没有注意到
<12-48,Rachel>She still has not noticed that

398
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,570
<12-48,Rachel>婴儿的袜子已经在地上了
<12-48,Rachel>the baby's sock is on the ground.

00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:18,100
<12-49,Phoebe>真是敬的好
<12-49,Phoebe>It's a good toast.

400
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:21,980
<12-50,Rachel>听着  你可不可以提醒一下她呢
<12-50,Rachel>Look,will you please get her attention?

<12-52,Phoebe>天啊  朱迪  把袜子捡起来
<12-52,Phoebe>Oh,for God's sake,Judy,pick up the sock!

<12-52,Phoebe>我很抱歉  刚刚很没礼貌吗
<12-52,Phoebe>I'm sorry,was that rude?

405
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:49,650
<12-52,Phoebe>我小小的吼叫
<12-52,Phoebe>Did my little outburst..

406
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:54,020
<12-52,Phoebe>使今晚的难堪更甚一步吗
<12-52,Phoebe>blunt the hideousness that is this evening?

407
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,910
<12-52,Phoebe>听着  我知道你们都有自己的事
<12-52,Phoebe>Look,I know you have a lot going on..

408
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:59,700
<12-52,Phoebe>但我想要的只不过是跟我的朋友
<12-52,Phoebe>but all I wanted to do was have dinner

409
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,200
<12-52,Phoebe>一起吃晚餐  庆祝我的生日
<12-52,Phoebe>with my friends on my birthday.

410
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:04,380
<12-52,Phoebe>你们全部都迟到
<12-52,Phoebe>And you are all so late,

411
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:07,900
<12-52,Phoebe>而且都不知道礼貌性地打电话通知一下
<12-52,Phoebe>and you didn't even have the courtesy to call.

412
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:12,280
<12-52,Phoebe>现在已经太晚了
<12-52,Phoebe>Well,it's too late now.

413
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:14,170
<12-53,Ross>菲比  我想那应该不是我们
<12-53,Ross>Phoebe,I don't think that's us.

414
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:19,840
<12-54,Phoebe>噢  这个还没完  你好

<12-56,Monica>噢  是这样的  我正在排卵

<12-57,Chandler>噢  是啊  她自己那样说罢了
<12-57,Chandler>Oh,yeah,that's what she says.

418
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:30,960
<12-57,Chandler>或许你根本没有在排卵
<12-57,Chandler>Maybe you're not ovulating at all.

419
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,190
<12-57,Chandler>或许那只是要拐我上床的借口
<12-57,Chandler>Maybe it's a clever ruse to get me into bed.

420
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:37,310
<12-58,Monica>是啊  烟虫  就是那样没错

00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:43,910
<12-59,Chandler>她撒谎  她竟然骗我跟她上床
<12-59,Chandler>She lied, she ttricked me into having sex with her.
