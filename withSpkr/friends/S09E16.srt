1
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,380
<1-1,Chandler>你看过我们的银行对帐单了吗
<1-1,Chandler>Have you seen our bank statement?

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:06,430
<1-1,Chandler>不会出错了吧
<1-1,Chandler>Can this be right?

3
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:08,510
<1-2,Monica>就是嘛  天啊
<1-2,Monica>I know. God,

4
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:10,770
<1-2,Monica>除了我小时候  双层夹心饼上市那会
<1-2,Monica>I haven't seen my savings take a hit like this...

5
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:13,660
<1-2,Monica>我的存款就没这么少过
<1-2,Monica>since I was a kid and they came up with Double Stuf Oreos.

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,260
<1-2,Monica>我们的存款哪去了呢
<1-2,Monica>What happened to all of our money?

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,650
<1-3,Chandler>我不清楚他们做了什么
<1-3,Chandler>I'm not sure exactly what they did...

8
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,840
<1-3,Chandler>但是我倾向于责怪安然公司倒闭案
<1-3,Chandler>but I'm inclined to blame Enron.

9
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:25,860
<1-4,Monica>大概因为你在做实习工
<1-4,Monica>I guess with you doing the internship,

10
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:27,910
<1-4,Monica>所以我们有些入不敷出
<1-4,Monica>we're spending more than we're bringing in.

11
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:30,710
<1-5,Chandler>是啊  或许我应该辞掉
<1-5,Chandler>Yeah, maybe I should quit

12
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,300
<1-5,Chandler>找个有薪水的工作
<1-5,Chandler>and get a job that pays.

13
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,930
<1-6,Monica>可你总算找到你喜欢的工作了
<1-6,Monica>But you're finally doing something that you love.

14
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,330
<1-6,Monica>我不能要求你放弃的
<1-6,Monica>I mean, I can't ask you to give that up.

15
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,190
<1-6,Monica>不过你喜欢做的工作是挖金子
<1-6,Monica>Although it would be nice if the thing that you loved

16
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,010
<1-6,Monica>那就好了
<1-6,Monica>was finding gold.

17
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:46,170
<1-7,Chandler>我觉得我们太小题大作了
<1-7,Chandler>You know, I think we're making too big a deal out of this.

18
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:48,150
<1-7,Chandler>我们这个月迟些付账单
<1-7,Chandler>We'll pay our bills late this month.

19
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,580
<1-7,Chandler>下个月我们就节省一些开销
<1-7,Chandler>Next month we'll cut back on a few things.

20
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:52,760
<1-7,Chandler>而且或许我们可以变换一下
<1-7,Chandler>And maybe we start eating out of Joey's refrigerator

21
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:53,800
<1-7,Chandler>到乔伊家的冰箱找食物
<1-7,Chandler>for a change.

22
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:55,720
<1-7,Chandler>你是大厨
<1-7,Chandler>You're a chef.

23
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:57,850
<1-7,Chandler>用苏打粉跟啤酒你会做什么菜
<1-7,Chandler>What can you make out of baking soda and beer?

24
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:00,810
<1-8,Monica>最糟糕的情况下
<1-8,Monica>Worst-case scenario is,

25
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,340
<1-8,Monica>我们只好找我父母借钱
<1-8,Monica>we borrow some money from my parents.

26
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,310
<1-9,Chandler>不可以  而且我们也不借钱
<1-9,Chandler>No, and we're not borrowing money.

27
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:06,100
<1-10,Monica>-为什么   -我们是宾家人
<1-10,Monica>- Why not? -We don't do that.

28
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,220
<1-11,Chandler>宾家人从不跟人借钱
<1-11,Chandler>We are Bings.

29
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,870
<1-11,Chandler>我爸唯一教会我的事  就是
<1-11,Chandler>If there's one thing my father taught me, it was...

30
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:13,590
<1-11,Chandler>去别人家泳池之前
<1-11,Chandler>well, to always knock

31
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,220
<1-11,Chandler>一定要先敲门
<1-11,Chandler>before going into the pool house.

32
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,260
<1-11,Chandler>还有  永远都不要向人借钱
<1-11,Chandler>The other thing is, never borrow money.

33
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:22,140
<1-12,Monica>我不知道你这么有自尊
<1-12,Monica>I had no idea you had this much pride.

34
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:24,260
<1-12,Monica>没错  我有  我是你男人
<1-12,Monica>That's right, I do. I am your man.

35
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:26,100
<1-13,Chandler>我会让我们度过难关的
<1-13,Chandler>I'm gonna get us through this situation...

36
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:28,450
<1-13,Chandler>就算你要加倍努力地工作
<1-13,Chandler>even if it means you working twice as hard.

48
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:12,170
<2-1,Mike>-我要回去了  -为什么
<2-1,Mike>- I'm gonna go.  - Why?

49
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,460
<2-3,Mike>我有好几天没有回家了
<2-3,Mike>I haven't been home in days,

50
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:14,840
<2-3,Mike>而且我需要多拿几件衣服
<2-3,Mike>and I need to get more clothes.

51
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:16,450
<2-4,Phoebe>你不用回去
<2-4,Phoebe>You don't have to go.

52
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,200
<2-4,Phoebe>我有衣服可以给你穿
<2-4,Phoebe>I have something that'll fit you.

53
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:21,740
<2-5,Mike>我穿女生的紧身衣  是在逗你
<2-5,Mike>I put that tube top on as a joke.

54
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,030
<2-6,Phoebe>我想要你留下来
<2-6,Phoebe>I want you to stay.

55
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,190
<2-7,Mike>我也想要留下来
<2-7,Mike>I want to stay too.

56
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,320
<2-7,Mike>但是这几条内裤我都穿遍了
<2-7,Mike>But I've got as much use out of these boxers as I can.

57
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,130
<2-8,Phoebe>-要不反过来再穿呢  -已经反过了
<2-8,Phoebe>- Why don't you turn them inside  - Done it.

58
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,220
<2-9,Mike>我几个小时之后就回来
<2-9,Mike>I'll be back in a couple of hours.

59
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,380
<2-10,Phoebe>好吧  我会想你的
<2-10,Phoebe>All right. I'll miss you.

60
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,050
<2-11,Mike>我也是
<2-11,Mike>Me too.

61
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,160
<2-12,Mike>你知道吗  我刚惊觉到一件事
<2-12,Mike>You know what? I just realized something.

62
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,290
<2-12,Mike>我不想回家
<2-12,Mike>I don't want to go home.

63
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,770
<2-13,Phoebe>太好了  好的  我去拿紧身衣
<2-13,Phoebe>Great! Okay, I'll go get the tube top.

64
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,770
<2-14,Mike>不  我的意思是
<2-14,Mike>No, no, what I mean is...

65
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:53,100
<2-14,Mike>我不喜欢回去自己的公寓里
<2-14,Mike>I hate going back to my apartment now.

66
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:56,620
<2-14,Mike>一方面是因为  我住的房间又小又乱
<2-14,Mike>Partly because I live above a known crack den...

67
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:00,160
<2-14,Mike>但是  主要是因为
<2-14,Mike>...but, you know, mostly because when I'm there,

68
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:01,790
<2-15,Phoebe>我回去的时候  真的好想你
<2-15,Phoebe>I really miss you.

69
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,290
<2-17,Phoebe>所以...
<2-17,Phoebe>So...

70
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,620
<2-18,Phoebe>我们同居好不好
<2-18,Phoebe>do you want to move in together?

71
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,640
<2-15,Phoebe>哇  迈克·汉尼根
<2-15,Phoebe>Wow, Mike Hanigan...

72
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,730
<2-15,Phoebe>你倒真有两把刷子  让女生说"好耶"
<2-15,Phoebe>...you sure know how to make a girl say ''Hell, yeah.''

73
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,170
<2-16,Mike>那我们要这样做吗
<2-16,Mike>So we're doing it?

74
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,850
<2-17,Phoebe>好啊  就这样  让我们住在一起
<2-17,Phoebe>Yeah, let's do it. Let's live together.

75
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:24,040
<2-18,Phoebe>我们真的要同居了吗
<2-18,Phoebe>We're really gonna move in together?

76
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:24,600
<2-19,Mike>是啊
<2-19,Mike>Yeah.

77
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,050
<2-20,Phoebe>我一直都想要跟男生同居
<2-20,Phoebe>I've always wanted to live with a guy.

78
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,310
<2-20,Phoebe>袜子捡起来
<2-20,Phoebe>Pick up your socks.

79
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,680
<2-20,Phoebe>把马桶圈给我放下来
<2-20,Phoebe>Put down the toilet seat.

80
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:34,140
<2-20,Phoebe>不  我再也不能再做爱了
<2-20,Phoebe>No, we are not having sex anymore.

81
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,120
<2-20,Phoebe>一定会很好玩
<2-20,Phoebe>It's gonna be fun.

82
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,360
<3-1,Monica>-嘿  乔伊  -嘿
<3-1,Monica>- Hey, Joey.  - Hey.

83
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:45,020
<3-3,Monica>听着  我要你跟我保证
<3-3,Monica>Listen, I need to know that what

84
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:46,920
<3-3,Monica>一会我要拜托你的事情
<3-3,Monica>I'm about to ask you...

85
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:49,220
<3-3,Monica>你永远都不会告诉钱德勒
<3-3,Monica>will never get back to Chandler.

86
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,600
<3-4,Joey>如果说我  没有想过那件事
<3-4,Joey>I'd be lying if I said I hadn't

87
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,060
<3-4,Joey>那是骗你的
<3-4,Joey>thought about it myself.

88
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,660
<3-4,Joey>但是钱德勒是我最好的朋友
<3-4,Joey>But Chandler is my best friend.

89
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,140
<3-4,Joey>那是不对的
<3-4,Joey>It would be wrong.

90
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:05,670
<3-4,Joey>感觉应该不错  却是不对的
<3-4,Joey>Good, but wrong.

91
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:10,100
<3-5,Monica>好的  首先  感觉会是棒翻天
<3-5,Monica>Okay, first of all, it would be great.

92
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:14,650
<3-5,Monica>但那不是我说的事  我要跟你借钱
<3-5,Monica>But that's not what I'm here to talk to you about. I need to borrow money.

93
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:17,540
<3-6,Joey>哦  不好说  莫妮卡  你知道
<3-6,Joey>Oh, I don't know, Monica. You know

94
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,240
<3-6,Joey>借钱给朋友不是什么好事
<3-6,Joey>lending friends money is always a mistake.

95
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:21,540
<3-7,Monica>但是钱德勒借过你钱啊
<3-7,Monica>But Chandler lent you money.

96
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:23,800
<3-8,Joey>而他也会告诉你  那不是什么好事
<3-8,Joey>And he would tell you it was a mistake.

97
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:25,860
<3-9,Monica>别这样  我只是...
<3-9,Monica>Come on, I just....

98
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:28,450
<3-9,Monica>需要付房租跟一些帐单
<3-9,Monica>I need it for some rent and some other bills.

99
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,330
<3-10,Joey>多少钱呢
<3-10,Joey>Well, how much?

100
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:33,590
<3-11,Monica>两千块
<3-11,Monica>Two thousand dollars?

101
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:34,620
<3-11,Monica>两千块
<3-11,Monica>Two thousand dollars?

102
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,390
<3-12,Joey>你以为我是谁  肥皂剧明星吗
<3-12,Joey>What do you think I am, a soap opera star?

103
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,150
<3-14,Joey>-是啊  -没错  我就是
<3-14,Joey>- Yeah.  - That's right, I am.

104
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,690
<3-15,Rachel>-嗨  你们好  -嘿
<3-15,Rachel>- Hi, you guys.  - Hey.

105
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:49,060
<3-16,Joey>袋子里是什么
<3-16,Joey>What's in the bag?

106
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,570
<3-17,Rachel>艾玛已经开始会爬了
<3-17,Rachel>You know how Emma started crawling?

107
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:54,370
<3-17,Rachel>我觉得这个地方  对婴儿很不安全
<3-17,Rachel>I realized that this place is very unsafe for a baby...

108
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,670
<3-17,Rachel>所以我去店里买了些东西
<3-17,Rachel>...so I went to the store

109
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,510
<3-17,Rachel>可以保护婴儿在公寓里活动
<3-17,Rachel>and I got some stuff to baby-proof the apartment.

110
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,660
<3-17,Rachel>哦  天啊  保护婴儿
<3-17,Rachel>Oh, God, baby-proofing.

111
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,610
<3-18,Joey>有什么了不起的
<3-18,Joey>Why is it such a big deal now?

112
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,420
<3-18,Joey>我小的时候  经常发生
<3-18,Joey>You know, when I was a kid, it was like:

113
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,060
<3-18,Joey>"哎呀  乔伊跌下楼梯了"
<3-18,Joey>''Whoops, Joey fell down the stairs.''

114
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,660
<3-18,Joey>或者  "糟糕  乔伊又电到自己了"
<3-18,Joey>Or, ''Whoops, Joey electrocuted himself again.''

115
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,980
<3-19,Monica>你要找人帮忙装这些东西吗
<3-19,Monica>Anyway, are you going to get a handyman to install this stuff?

116
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:19,150
<3-20,Rachel>不  我自己来就行了
<3-20,Rachel>No, I was just gonna do it myself.

117
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:25,530
<3-21,Joey>-你要自己来  -是啊  不行吗
<3-21,Joey>- You're gonna do it?  - Yeah. Why?

118
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:27,630
<3-22,Rachel>你觉得女人做不来吗
<3-22,Rachel>You don't think a woman can do this?

119
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,010
<3-23,Joey>女人可以  你不行
<3-23,Joey>Women can. You can't.

120
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:34,980
<3-24,Rachel>莫妮卡  请你告诉乔伊  他是猪
<3-24,Rachel>Monica, will you please tell Joey that he is a pig.

121
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,720
<3-25,Monica>你是猪  而你做不来
<3-25,Monica>You're a pig. And you can't do this.

122
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,690
<3-25,Monica>什么
<3-25,Monica>What?

123
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:43,520
<3-26,Rachel>别这样  我自己都找到五金店了
<3-26,Rachel>What? Come on, I found the hardware store all by myself.

124
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,680
<3-27,Joey>五金店不就在街角嘛
<3-27,Joey>The store's right down the street.

125
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:48,030
<3-28,Rachel>街角就有五金店啊
<3-28,Rachel>There is a hardware store right down the street?

126
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,370
<4-1,Phoebe>嘿  各位  我们有好消息要宣布
<4-1,Phoebe>Hey, you guys? Okay, we've got great news.

127
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,400
<4-2,Mike>菲比跟我要搬到一起了
<4-2,Mike>Phoebe and I are moving in together.

128
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,950
<4-2,Mike>恭喜
<4-2,Mike>Congratulations.

129
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,500
<4-3,Phoebe>好兴奋  我从来都没跟男生同居过
<4-3,Phoebe>I know, it's so exciting. You know, I've never lived with a guy before.

130
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:03,950
<4-4,Monica>其实跟女生同居是一样的
<4-4,Monica>Well, it's just like living with a girl,

131
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,640
<4-4,Monica>只是他们不会偷用你的化妆品
<4-4,Monica>only they don't steal your makeup.

132
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,020
<4-4,Monica>除非他们扮演
<4-4,Monica>Unless they're playing

133
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,850
<4-4,Monica>"我要有妹妹  她长什么样"
<4-4,Monica>''This Is What My Sister Would Look Like.''

134
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:12,890
<4-5,Chandler>我妹长得不是很可爱
<4-5,Chandler>Yeah, she's not so cute.

<4-10,Phoebe>是啊  我们在模仿你们俩个
<4-10,Phoebe>Uh-huh. We're playing you two.

140
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:27,810
<4-11,Monica>我们才没有那样
<4-11,Monica>We don't do that.

141
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,750
<4-11,Monica>告诉她  我们没有
<4-11,Monica>Tell her we don't do that.

<4-12,Chandler>是的  亲爱的
<4-12,Chandler>Yes, dear.

143
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:35,460
<4-13,Ross>不敢相信你们要同居了
<4-13,Ross>I can't believe you're moving in together.

144
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,880
<4-13,Ross>真替你们高兴
<4-13,Ross>I'm happy for you guys.

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,260
<4-14,Monica>我听到婚礼进行曲了

<4-15,Phoebe>你知道的  我是说  我不知道...
<4-15,Phoebe>You know, I mean, I don't know...

149
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:46,940
<4-15,Phoebe>我能预见  有天跟迈克结婚吗
<4-15,Phoebe>...can I see someday being married to Mike?

150
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,160
<4-15,Phoebe>是的  当然
<4-15,Phoebe>Sure. Yeah.

151
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,000
<4-15,Phoebe>我可以想像
<4-15,Phoebe>I could picture myself

152
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:52,060
<4-15,Phoebe>穿着婚纱走在红毯上
<4-15,Phoebe>walking down the aisle in a wedding dress...

153
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:53,640
<4-15,Phoebe>婚纱主要突显我的胸部
<4-15,Phoebe>.that highlights my breasts

154
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:55,640
<4-15,Phoebe>但是是很高雅的爆乳
<4-15,Phoebe>in an obvious yet classy way.

155
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:57,970
<4-15,Phoebe>但问我想不想要
<4-15,Phoebe>But do I want

<6-1,Chandler>Look, I need to ask you a favor,

176
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,270
<6-2,Joey>而且不能跟莫妮卡说
<6-2,Joey>and we can't tell Monica anything about it.

177
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,160
<6-3,Chandler>我以为你们之间没有秘密
<6-3,Chandler>I thought you guys didn't have secrets.

178
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:12,760
<6-4,Joey>官方说法上是那样没错
<6-4,Joey>That will remain the official party line.

179
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:19,140
<6-5,Chandler>莫妮卡跟我  有一点点经济上的问题
<6-5,Chandler>Look, Monica and I are having a little financial trouble.

180
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:20,920
<6-6,Joey>是啊  我知道
<6-6,Joey>Yeah, I know.

181
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,870
<6-7,Chandler>什么  你怎么知道的
<6-7,Chandler>What? How do you know?

182
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,820
<6-8,Joey>我猜的  你知道的
<6-8,Joey>I just figured it out, you know?

183
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:30,260
<6-8,Joey>你没有工作  而且现在经济又很萧条
<6-8,Joey>I mean, you're not working, and the economy is bad.

184
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,940
<6-9,Chandler>哦  对
<6-9,Chandler>Oh, right.

185
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:35,400
<6-9,Chandler>这是我反应最快的一次了
<6-9,Chandler>That is the fastest I have ever thought.

186
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,260
<6-10,Chandler>反正...
<6-10,Chandler>Anyway...

187
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,800
<6-10,Chandler>我需要跟你借点钱
<6-10,Chandler>I need to borrow some money.

188
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:46,240
<6-11,Joey>当然可以  多少钱  两千块吗
<6-11,Joey>Oh, sure. Yeah, how much? Two thousand dollars?

189
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:50,370
<6-12,Chandler>是的  正是两千块
<6-12,Chandler>Yes, $2000 exactly.

190
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,500
<6-12,Chandler>你是怎么知道的
<6-12,Chandler>How did you know that?

191
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,170
<6-13,Joey>我知道你之前赚多少钱
<6-13,Joey>I know how much you used to make,

192
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,070
<6-13,Joey>而且我也知道你们的房租
<6-13,Joey>and I know how much your rent is.

193
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:02,010
<6-13,Joey>哦  好的
<6-13,Joey>Oh, okay.

194
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:05,010
<6-14,Chandler>我真是天才
<6-14,Chandler>I am on fire.

195
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,920
<6-14,Chandler>听着  你真好
<6-14,Chandler>Listen, this is really nice.

196
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:11,110
<6-14,Chandler>你是不是开了一张
<6-14,Chandler>Did you write a check

197
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:13,190
<6-14,Chandler>两千块的支票给莫妮卡
<6-14,Chandler>to Monica for $2000?

198
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:16,420
<6-15,Joey>莫妮卡跟你借钱了
<6-15,Joey>Did Monica borrow money from you?

199
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:18,550
<6-15,Joey>好像是
<6-15,Joey>Kind of.

200
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,240
<6-16,Chandler>我不敢相信她竟然这样做
<6-16,Chandler>I can't believe her.

201
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,030
<6-16,Chandler>她跟你说我们经济出问题了吗
<6-16,Chandler>Did she tell you we were having money problems?

202
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:25,310
<6-17,Joey>不  不是为了你们的经济问题
<6-17,Joey>No, no, no. It wasn't because of your money problems.

203
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,900
<6-17,Joey>是她自己的东西
<6-17,Joey>It was for something for her.

204
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,510
<6-18,Chandler>什么
<6-18,Chandler>What?

205
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,940
<6-19,Joey>很私人的东西
<6-19,Joey>Something personal.

206
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:33,940
<6-20,Chandler>她要买两千块的东西
<6-20,Chandler>What would she get for $2000

207
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:34,990
<6-20,Chandler>还不能告诉我
<6-20,Chandler>that she wouldn't tell me about?

208
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,110
<6-21,Woman>打扰一下
<6-21,Woman>Excuse me.

209
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,400
<6-22,Joey>隆乳手术
<6-22,Joey>Boob job.

210
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:43,770
<6-22,Joey>隆乳手术  她根本不需要啊
<6-22,Joey>A boob job? She doesn't need that.

211
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:44,840
<6-23,Chandler>太疯狂了
<6-23,Chandler>That's crazy.

212
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,890
<6-24,Joey>不算太疯狂  好吗
<6-24,Joey>Well, it's not that crazy, okay?

213
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:50,840
<6-24,Joey>把咪咪变小才叫做疯狂
<6-24,Joey>Making them smaller, that would be crazy.

214
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,150
<6-24,Joey>嘿  我想要问你
<6-24,Joey>Oh, hey, I wanted to ask you about

215
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,420
<7-1,Mike>关于莫妮卡"新郎"的玩笑
<7-1,Mike>Monica's little ''groomie'' joke.

216
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:00,000
<7-2,Phoebe>我想大家会笑
<7-2,Phoebe>Well, I think the reason people laughed is

217
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:01,640
<7-2,Phoebe>是因为"新室友"和"新郎"音近
<7-2,Phoebe>that it's a play on the word ''roomie.''

218
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:07,700
<7-3,Mike>我听得懂这个笑话  真是高深啊
<7-3,Mike>I get the joke. Sophisticated as it was.

219
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:11,540
<7-3,Mike>不  我要说的是...
<7-3,Mike>No, the thing I want to say is....

220
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:15,200
<7-3,Mike>或许我们之前就应该先谈过
<7-3,Mike>Maybe we should've talked about this before.

221
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:17,200
<7-3,Mike>我们同居之后
<7-3,Mike>Us living together,

222
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,010
<7-3,Mike>你没有期望我会求婚吧
<7-3,Mike>you're not expecting a proposal, right?

223
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:23,190
<7-4,Phoebe>-哦  不  一点也没有  -好的
<7-4,Phoebe>- Oh, no, no. Not at all.  - Okay.

224
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,540
<7-4,Phoebe>我们才刚搬进来一起住
<7-4,Phoebe>We're just moving in right now.

225
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:26,870
<7-4,Phoebe>将来怎样顺其自然
<7-4,Phoebe>We'll see where it goes.

226
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:28,860
<7-5,Mike>对  这就是个问题
<7-5,Mike>Yeah, well, that's the thing.

227
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:31,270
<7-5,Mike>对我而言  这已经是我的极限了
<7-5,Mike>For me, it's as far as it can ever go.

228
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,220
<7-6,Phoebe>你是什么意思
<7-6,Phoebe>What do you mean?

229
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:35,300
<7-7,Mike>听着  菲比  我...
<7-7,Mike>Look, Phoebe, I....

230
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,590
<7-7,Mike>我非常爱你  但我不想再结婚了
<7-7,Mike>I love you very much. But I never want to get married again.

231
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:46,070
<7-9,Mike>只是我的第一次婚姻太...
<7-9,Mike>It's just, my first marriage was...

232
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:50,810
<7-9,Mike>太糟糕了  我已经对婚姻失去信心了
<7-9,Mike>you know, such a disaster that I kind of lost faith in the whole idea.

233
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,800
<7-10,Phoebe>有那么糟吗
<7-10,Phoebe>Was it that bad?

234
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,030
<7-11,Mike>到最后...有一次
<7-11,Mike>At one point, near the end...

235
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,680
<7-11,Mike>她故意便便在我的...
<7-11,Mike>she deliberately defecated on my

236
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:57,230
<7-12,Phoebe>哦  那真糟
<7-12,Phoebe>Okay, well, that's bad. Yeah.

237
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,510
<7-12,Phoebe>但你不认为
<7-12,Phoebe>But don't you think it might be different

238
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,730
<7-12,Phoebe>换个人会不一样吗
<7-12,Phoebe>with someone else? Perhaps...

239
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:04,760
<7-12,Phoebe>或许是一个
<7-12,Phoebe>a blond

240
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:06,460
<7-12,Phoebe>会在厕所便便的金发女郎
<7-12,Phoebe>who always uses the toilet?

241
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,960
<7-12,Phoebe>除了便在海里的那次
<7-12,Phoebe>Except for once in the ocean.

242
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,410
<7-13,Mike>听着  不是结婚对象是谁的问题
<7-13,Mike>Look, it's not about who I would marry.

243
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,120
<7-13,Mike>我第一次结婚的时候
<7-13,Mike>I was certain the first time I got married

244
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:19,070
<7-13,Mike>我坚信会白头到老  但我错了
<7-13,Mike>it'd last forever. I was wrong.

245
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,520
<7-14,Phoebe>但是  只是
<7-14,Phoebe>But, it just

246
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,940
<7-15,Mike>菲比  问题不在你
<7-15,Mike>Look, Phoebe, it's not about you.

247
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:23,600
<7-16,Phoebe>我只是再也不想结婚了
<7-16,Phoebe>I just never want to get married again.

<7-17,Mike>Are you okay with that? If not,

250
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,380
<7-17,Mike>或许我们同居  不是个好主意
<7-17,Mike>maybe us moving in together isn't the best idea.

253
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,970
<7-18,Phoebe>因为如果我们住在一起了
<7-18,Phoebe>Because if we move in

254
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,200
<7-18,Phoebe>你再开始改变主意...

270
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:37,680
<8-10,Chandler>我希望你不要改变任何一点
<8-10,Chandler>there is not one thing I would change about you?

271
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:40,110
<8-10,Chandler>一点都不要变  而且特别是...
<8-10,Chandler>Not one single thing. And definitely not...

272
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,720
<8-10,Chandler>那两点
<8-10,Chandler>two single things.

273
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,890
<8-11,Monica>好的  你真的很怪
<8-11,Monica>Okay, you're being weird.

274
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:48,280
<8-11,Monica>你想上床吗  还是做了什么错事
<8-11,Monica>Do you want sex, or did you do something bad?

275
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:52,560
<8-12,Chandler>不  我就是爱你这模样  我爱你的
<8-12,Chandler>No. No. No. I just love the way you look. I am warm

276
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:53,910
<8-12,Chandler>身材
<8-12,Chandler>for your form.

277
00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:00,570
<8-13,Monica>传统上  一般都是说 "你很漂亮"
<8-13,Monica>Okay, you know the old classics like, you know, ''You look nice''?

278
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:01,790
<8-13,Monica>这句话还适用
<8-13,Monica>They're still okay.

279
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:04,030
<8-13,Monica>但是"你很漂亮"可能只是代表
<8-13,Monica>But ''you look nice'' could mean that I'm saying,

280
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:05,240
<8-14,Chandler>"你的脸蛋看起来漂亮"
<8-14,Chandler>''Your face looks nice.''

281
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:07,580
<8-14,Chandler>我想要赞美你的身体
<8-14,Chandler>I want to compliment your body.

282
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:11,250
<8-14,Chandler>我是说  我一点都不想它改变
<8-14,Chandler>I mean, I wouldn't change it at all.

283
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:12,400
<8-14,Chandler>而且更详细地说  就是
<8-14,Chandler>And more specifically,

284
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:14,640
<8-14,Chandler>我不想让任何部位变大
<8-14,Chandler>I wouldn't want anything to get any bigger.

285
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:18,210
<8-15,Monica>-好的  -我是说...
<8-15,Monica>- Okay.  - I mean...

286
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:19,500
<8-16,Chandler>你也不会想要我身体的某部份变大
<8-16,Chandler>...you wouldn't want any part of me to get any bigger,

287
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,680
<8-16,Chandler>不是吗
<8-16,Chandler>would you?

288
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:25,630
<8-16,Chandler>此题不用回答
<8-16,Chandler>Don't answer that.

289
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,800
<8-17,Rachel>我还以为那老兄不可能更怪了
<8-17,Rachel>Just when you thought that dude couldn't get any weirder.

290
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,960
<8-18,Monica>你觉得他  为什么要担心我会变大
<8-18,Monica>Why do you think he was so worried about me getting bigger?

291
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:39,390
<8-19,Rachel>我不知道  这事儿从何而起啊
<8-19,Rachel>I don't know. I mean, what brought that on?

292
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:43,740
<8-20,Monica>我的天  我们正努力要怀孕...
<8-20,Monica>Oh, my God. You know what, we're trying to get pregnant...

293
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:46,900
<8-20,Monica>所以他可能  很怕我的身材会变形
<8-20,Monica>...so he's probably starting to freak out that my body's gonna change.

294
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:48,740
<8-21,Rachel>你认为是这样吗
<8-21,Rachel>You think that's what it is?

295
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,700
<8-22,Monica>你也听到了
<8-22,Monica>You heard him.

296
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,600
<8-22,Monica>"不要变大  你很完美了
<8-22,Monica>''No bigger. You're perfect.

297
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:52,990
<8-22,Monica>不要再变大了"
<8-22,Monica>Just don't get any bigger.''

298
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,280
<8-22,Monica>天啊  他听起来就像是
<8-22,Monica>My God, he sounded just like

299
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:55,980
<8-22,Monica>我高中的摔角教练
<8-22,Monica>my high-school wrestling coach.

300
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:00,740
<8-22,Monica>我必须要跟钱德勒谈谈
<8-22,Monica>I'm gonna have to talk to Chandler.

00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,170
<11-8,Rachel>我的胸部会变大的
<11-8,Rachel>My breasts are gonna get bigger

366
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,570
<11-9,Monica>不管你喜不喜欢
<11-9,Monica>whether you like it or not.

367
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,570
<11-9,Monica>而且不只是我的胸部
<11-9,Monica>And it's not just my breasts.

368
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,240
<11-9,Monica>我的屁股也会变大
<11-9,Monica>My ass is gonna get bigger too.

369
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:31,480
<11-10,Chandler>你的屁股
<11-10,Chandler>Your ass?!

370
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:36,480
<11-11,Rachel>而且如果她的手脚也变大  别太惊讶
<11-11,Rachel>And don't be surprised if her hands and her feet get bigger too.

371
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:41,700
<11-13,Monica>-他们也会吗  -这就像整套的一样
<11-13,Monica>- They do that?  - It's kind of a package deal.

372
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,270
<11-14,Chandler>天啊  为什么
<11-14,Chandler>God, why?

373
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,390
<11-14,Chandler>为什么你要对自己做这种事呢
<11-14,Chandler>Why would you want to do that to yourself?

374
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,880
<11-15,Monica>我以为这是我们俩都想要的
<11-15,Monica>I thought it was something that we both wanted.

375
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:51,420
<11-16,Chandler>如果这对你那么重要  胸部那块
<11-16,Chandler>If it means that much to you,

376
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,560
<11-16,Chandler>我或许可以释怀
<11-16,Chandler>I may be able to get onboard with the boobs...

377
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:56,020
<11-16,Chandler>但是大屁股还有大脚丫
<11-16,Chandler>but the giant ass and the big clown feet?

378
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,100
<11-17,Rachel>哦  天啊  钱德勒
<11-17,Rachel>Oh, my God, Chandler.

379
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:01,840
<11-17,Rachel>如果你连这个都受不了
<11-17,Rachel>If you can't handle this,

380
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:03,400
<11-17,Rachel>那你到了医院要怎么办...
<11-17,Rachel>what will you be like in the hospital...

381
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:04,870
<11-17,Rachel>加上流血和尖叫声
<11-17,Rachel>...with the blood and screaming

382
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,160
<11-17,Rachel>还有那个  从她身体挤出来的小小人
<11-17,Rachel>and the little person that's shooting out of her?

383
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:11,330
<11-17,Rachel>什么
<11-17,Rachel>What?

384
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,690
<12-1,Rachel>乔伊  你为什么要跟钱德勒说
<12-1,Rachel>Joey, why did you tell Chandler

385
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,840
<12-1,Rachel>莫妮卡要去做隆乳手术呢
<12-1,Rachel>that Monica was getting a boob job?

386
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:24,660
<12-2,Joey>因为她是要啊
<12-2,Joey>Because she is.

387
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:27,880
<12-3,Monica>钱德勒知道我跟你借钱了
<12-3,Monica>Chandler knows I borrowed the money.

388
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:29,610
<12-4,Joey>为了要做隆乳手术
<12-4,Joey>For your boob job.

389
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:31,660
<12-4,Joey>-乔伊  -结束了
<12-4,Joey>- Joe... - It's over.

390
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:33,710
<12-5,Joey>好了  所以我借出了四千块
<12-5,Joey>Okay, so I'm out $4000

391
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,630
<12-5,Joey>结果没有人的胸部会变大
<12-5,Joey>and nobody's boobs are getting any bigger?

392
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:42,920
<12-5,Joey>嘿  嘿  你们觉得这样如何呢
<12-5,Joey>Hey. Hey, what do you guys think about this:

393
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:45,570
<13-1,Ross>罗斯  离婚侠
<13-1,Ross>Ross, the Divorce Force.

394
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:48,640
<13-2,Phoebe>-比较好了  -是吗
<13-2,Phoebe>- Better.  - Yeah?

395
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:50,680
<13-3,Mike>非常酷
<13-3,Mike>Very cool.

396
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,500
<13-4,Ross>嘿  菲比 我真的很高兴
<13-4,Ross>Hey, Pheebs? You know, I'm really glad

397
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:57,070
<13-4,Ross>那天你过来找我谈了
<13-4,Ross>you came to talk to me the other day...

398
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,750
<13-4,Ross>希望我有帮上忙
<13-4,Ross>...and I hope I was a little helpful.

399
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,120
<13-5,Phoebe>是啊  帮助很大
<13-5,Phoebe>Yeah, you were helpful.

400
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:01,900
<13-5,Phoebe>-是啊  很谢谢你  -很好  很好
<13-5,Phoebe>- Yeah. No, thank you.  - Good. Good.

401
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:04,840
<13-6,Ross>因为我越想越觉得...
<13-6,Ross>Because the more I thought about it, the more I realized...

402
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:09,330
<13-6,Ross>婚姻对你而言  不见得是必经之路
<13-6,Ross>...I don't think marriage is necessarily the right path for you.

403
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,560
<13-7,Phoebe>你是什么意思
<13-7,Phoebe>What do you mean?

404
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,910
<13-8,Ross>我知道那天在咖啡馆的时候...
<13-8,Ross>I know the other day in the coffeehouse...

405
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,410
<13-8,Ross>你很沉醉于当中产阶级妇女什么的
<13-8,Ross>you were all caught up in the whole soccer-mom thing...

406
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,780
<13-8,Ross>但是那是真的你吗
<13-8,Ross>...but is that really you?

407
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:20,800
<13-8,Ross>你可以想像自己开着沃尔沃吗
<13-8,Ross>I mean, can you honestly picture yourself in a Volvo?

408
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,390
<13-9,Phoebe>富豪汽车是太有棱有角了
<13-9,Phoebe>They are awfully boxy.

409
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:28,030
<13-10,Ross>我是说  婚姻对你而言  是很无趣的
<13-10,Ross>I mean, I don't know, you'd be so bored with marriage.

410
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:30,510
<13-10,Ross>那太中规中矩了
<13-10,Ross>I mean, it's so normal.

411
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,000
<13-11,Phoebe>是啊
<13-11,Phoebe>Yeah.

412
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:36,080
<13-12,Ross>嘿  需要帮忙吗
<13-12,Ross>Hey, can I help?

413
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:38,230
<13-13,Chandler>我们爬了四层楼
<13-13,Chandler>Well, we climbed up four flights of stairs,

414
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:39,470
<13-13,Chandler>好不容易通过狭窄的通道
<13-13,Chandler>maneuvered a narrow hallway...

415
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,090
<13-13,Chandler>躲过一只狂犬病斗牛狗
<13-13,Chandler>dodged a rabid pit bull.

416
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:44,430
<13-13,Chandler>但是最后这三尺路才是最崎岖的
<13-13,Chandler>But these last three feet are where it gets really tricky.

417
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:49,050
<13-14,Ross>有时候你的话真伤人
<13-14,Ross>You know, sometimes your words, they hurt.

418
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,240
<13-15,Joey>嘿  你们要把这个放哪呢
<13-15,Joey>Hey, where do you guys want this?

419
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:56,750
<13-16,Rachel>是啊  快点  因为真的很重
<13-16,Rachel>Yeah, seriously, because this is really heavy.

420
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,430
<13-16,Rachel>不是我  我只是假装扶着
<13-16,Rachel>I mean, not for me, because I'm only

421
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,400
<13-16,Rachel>但他们几个真的快被压死了
<13-16,Rachel>pretending to hold it, but for these guys.

422
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:06,030
<13-17,Phoebe>最后再问你一次结婚的事
<13-17,Phoebe>Just one last time on the marriage thing.

423
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,020
<13-17,Phoebe>没有再考虑的空间吗
<13-17,Phoebe>There's no wiggle room?

424
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:08,960
<13-17,Phoebe>一点都没有
<13-17,Phoebe>None at all?

425
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,150
<13-18,Mike>没有  你也不想结婚  不是吗
<13-18,Mike>No, but you don't want to get married either, right?

426
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:13,270
<13-18,Mike>没错
<13-18,Mike>Right.

427
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,720
<13-19,Phoebe>不过  我是真的想要结婚
<13-19,Phoebe>Except that I do want to get married.

428
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,680
<13-17,Phoebe>不能在楼下卸货前先谈这个吗
<13-17,Phoebe>Couldn't have had this conversation down at the truck, huh?

429
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:22,090
<13-18,Mike>什么  你想要结婚
<13-18,Mike>What? You want to get married?

430
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:24,050
<13-21,Phoebe>总有一天
<13-21,Phoebe>Someday.

431
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,490
<13-22,Chandler>得了疝气了...
<13-22,Chandler>And...hernia.

432
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:31,320
<13-23,Phoebe>我从未有过正常的生活
<13-23,Phoebe>I haven't had a normal life.

433
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:34,690
<13-23,Phoebe>而我也从没有觉得缺失过什么
<13-23,Phoebe>And I never felt like I was missing out on anything.

434
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,420
<13-23,Phoebe>但是现在我觉得
<13-23,Phoebe>But it feels like now it's my turn

435
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,550
<13-23,Phoebe>该轮到我拥有正常的东西了
<13-23,Phoebe>to have some of the regular stuff.

436
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,450
<13-24,Mike>你为什么不早说呢
<13-24,Mike>Why didn't you say something before?

437
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,660
<13-25,Phoebe>我之前不确定我有多想要
<13-25,Phoebe>I didn't know how much I wanted it.

438
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:48,260
<13-25,Phoebe>而且我爱你  我想要跟你一起住
<13-25,Phoebe>And I love you, and I wanted to live with you.

439
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:50,660
<13-26,Mike>我也想跟你一起住  我们就搬到一起吧
<13-26,Mike>I want to live with you too. I mean, let's do that.

440
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:52,670
<13-27,Phoebe>但是我做不到
<13-27,Phoebe>But I don't think I can.

441
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:54,910
<13-27,Phoebe>当我不清楚未来会怎样时
<13-27,Phoebe>It was okay to move in

442
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,360
<13-27,Phoebe>是可以搬到一起
<13-27,Phoebe>when I didn't know what was gonna happen.

443
00:20:57,410 --> 00:20:59,500
<13-27,Phoebe>但已经知道是毫无未来了
<13-27,Phoebe>But I can't move in knowing nothing is

444
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,020
<13-27,Phoebe>我做不到
<13-27,Phoebe>ever gonna happen.

445
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,940
<13-28,Mike>我们可以至少先试试同居吧
<13-28,Mike>Can we at least try living together?

446
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:05,140
<13-28,Mike>你或许会改变对婚姻的想法
<13-28,Mike>You might change your mind about marriage.

447
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,770
<13-29,Phoebe>你会改变你的想法吗
<13-29,Phoebe>Are you gonna change yours?

448
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:10,550
<13-30,Mike>不会
<13-30,Mike>No.

449
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:12,940
<13-31,Phoebe>我也不会
<13-31,Phoebe>Me neither.

450
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:21,790
<13-31,Phoebe>我需要一个对未来有共同梦想的人
<13-31,Phoebe>I think I need to be with someone who wants what I want.

451
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:27,190
<13-32,Mike>但是我不想要结束
<13-32,Mike>But I don't want this to end.

452
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:29,370
<13-33,Phoebe>我也不想要结束
<13-33,Phoebe>No, I don't want it to end either.

453
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,440
<13-34,Mike>我不敢相信就要这样结束了
<13-34,Mike>I can't believe this is gonna end.

454
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:41,130
<13-34,Mike>我会把我的东西打包好
<13-34,Mike>I guess I'll have my stuff picked up.

455
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:44,090
<13-35,Phoebe>好的
<13-35,Phoebe>Yeah. Okay.

<13-38,Rachel>我很遗憾  菲比
<13-38,Rachel>I'm so sorry, Pheebs.

<13-39,Monica>We're all sorry.

461
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:24,170
<13-40,Chandler>往好处想
<13-40,Chandler>Look on the bright side.

462
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,620
<13-40,Chandler>至少你可以远离那张丑椅子了
<13-40,Chandler>At least you won't have to live with this ugly chair.

463
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,080
<13-40,Chandler>这个就是你的  对不对
<13-40,Chandler>That was here already, huh?

00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,430
<14-1,Joey>最好拿多一点
<14-1,Joey>I'd better take all I can carry.

468
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,270
<14-1,Joey>谁知道下次能不能打得开呢
<14-1,Joey>Who knows when I'll be able to get in here again, huh?
