00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,100
<3-34,Parker>好漂亮的地方  好棒的夜晚
<3-34,Parker>What a beautiful place. What a great night.

125
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,370
<3-34,Parker>我得告诉你们
<3-34,Parker>I have to tell you,

126
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:02,730
<3-34,Parker>能跟你们一起待在C宴会厅
<3-34,Parker>being here with all of you in Event Room C...

127
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:08,920
<3-34,Parker>我觉得好幸运  想想这里曾有过的美好时光
<3-34,Parker>...I feel so lucky. Think of the good times that happened here.

128
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:13,410
<3-34,Parker>生日  毕业舞会  犹太教成人礼
<3-34,Parker>The birthdays, the proms, the mitzvahs, both bar and bat!

129
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,220
<3-34,Parker>但任凭什么都比不上今晚
<3-34,Parker>But none of them will compare with tonight!

130
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,250
<3-34,Parker>天啊  我想铭记这个瞬间
<3-34,Parker>My God, I don't want to forget this moment!

131
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:22,450
<3-34,Parker>我要在脑海中帮你们拍张照
<3-34,Parker>It's like I want to take a mental picture of you all.

132
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:23,980
<3-34,Parker>咔嚓
<3-34,Parker>Click.

133
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,820
<3-35,Chandler>我觉得闪光灯没开
<3-35,Chandler>I don't think the flash went off.

134
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:33,120
<3-36,Parker>我要去趟洗手间  马上回来
<3-36,Parker>I'm gonna find the men's room. I'll be right back.

135
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,750
<3-38,Parker>-我跟你一起去  -快来
<3-38,Parker>- I'll go with you. - Come on, come on.

136
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,200
<3-39,Chandler>有人躲在某个地方端着麻醉枪
<3-39,Chandler>Somewhere there is someone with a tranquilizer gun...

137
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,410
<3-39,Chandler>握着大蝴蝶网  在找那个家伙
<3-39,Chandler>...and a huge butterfly net looking for that man.

138
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:42,920
<3-40,Joey>我也想上厕所
<3-40,Joey>I have to go to the bathroom too,

139
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,600
<3-40,Joey>但我不想让他夸奖我的小弟弟
<3-40,Joey>but I don't want him complimenting my thing.

140
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:49,550
<3-41,Ross>还好我们没在车上  他有安静的时候吗
<3-41,Ross>So glad we weren't in the car. Did he ever let up?

141
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:53,300
<3-42,Monica>他称长岛高速公路为"水泥奇迹"
<3-42,Monica>He called the Long Island Expressway a "concrete miracle."

142
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:57,220
<3-43,Ross>这个房间  这个夜晚
<3-43,Ross>This room. This night.

143
00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:00,140
<3-43,Ross>那个服务生  他的鞋子
<3-43,Ross>That waiter! His shoes!

144
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:03,550
<3-43,Ross>我要在脑海中拍张照
<3-43,Ross>I must take a mental picture!

145
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,250
<3-43,Ross>抱歉
<3-43,Ross>Sorry.

146
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:11,980
<3-44,Phoebe>你们在取笑派克吗
<3-44,Phoebe>Were you guys making fun of Parker?

147
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,360
<3-45,Ross>那得看你听到了多少
<3-45,Ross>That depends, how much did you hear?

148
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,140
<3-46,Phoebe>他是有点狂热  可那有什么不对
<3-46,Phoebe>He's a little enthusiastic. What's wrong with that?

149
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:24,290
<3-47,Monica>-他太过火了  -那又怎么样  我喜欢他
<3-47,Monica>- It's so much. - Well, so what? I like him.

150
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:26,740
<3-47,Monica>我会取笑你们的约会对象吗
<3-47,Monica>Do I make fun of the people you've dated?

151
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,930
<3-48,Phoebe>泰格  珍妮丝  蒙娜
<3-48,Phoebe>Tag, Janice, Mona.

152
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:31,390
<3-48,Phoebe>不  因为朋友不会那么做
<3-48,Phoebe>No, because friends don't do that.

153
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,050
<3-48,Phoebe>你们想知道我的想法吗
<3-48,Phoebe>But do you want my opinion?

154
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:34,500
<3-48,Phoebe>依我看来
<3-48,Phoebe>Do you want it? 'Cause in my opinion,

155
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,140
<3-48,Phoebe>你们的约会纪录加起来
<3-48,Phoebe>your collective dating record

156
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:39,110
<3-48,Phoebe>基本等同于人渣史
<3-48,Phoebe>reads like a who's who of human crap!

157
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:44,350
<3-49,Monica>-我觉得好内疚  -我知道
<3-49,Monica>- I feel terrible. - I know.

158
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:48,070
<3-51,Ross>蒙娜有哪里不好
<3-51,Ross>What was wrong with Mona?

159
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,960
<4-1,Rachel>-快打开  -好耶  宝贝
<4-1,Rachel>- Open it, open it, open it. - Yeah, baby!

160
00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:00,200
<4-3,Man>我们都没听说你们举办了婚礼
<4-3,Man>So we never got to hear about your wedding.

161
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,510
<4-4,Woman>我们很讶异自己没有受到邀请
<4-4,Woman>We were surprised we weren't invited.

162
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:05,870
<4-5,Ross>不  只有我们父母和几位亲友参加
<4-5,Ross>No, no, it was just our parents and 1 or 2 friends.

163
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,040
<4-5,Ross>婚礼的规模很小
<4-5,Ross>It was a small wedding.

164
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,060
<4-6,Rachel>但场面很美
<4-6,Rachel>But it was beautiful.

165
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:11,020
<4-6,Rachel>婚礼虽小  一应俱全
<4-6,Rachel>It was small, but kind of spectacular.

166
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,690
<4-7,Man>你们在哪里举行的婚礼
<4-7,Man>Where did you have it?

167
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:16,460
<4-8,Rachel>在巴巴多斯悬崖上的黄昏婚礼
<4-8,Rachel>On a cliff in Barbados, at sunset.

168
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:21,130
<4-8,Rachel>我走上红毯时  史提夫·汪达唱着《她真美》
<4-8,Rachel>And Stevie Wonder sang "Isn't She Lovely" as I walked down the aisle.

169
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:24,120
<4-10,Rachel>-真的吗  -史提夫是我们家的朋友
<4-10,Rachel>- Really? - Yeah. Stevie's a family friend.

<4-11,Woman>天啊  那真的是太棒了
<4-11,Woman>Oh, my God. That sounds amazing.

<4-11,Woman>-我想看照片  -对  我也是
<4-11,Woman>- I'd love to see pictures. - Yeah, so would I.

172
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:32,110
<4-12,Rachel>你们不会相信安妮·莱波维兹
<4-12,Rachel>You wouldn't think Annie Liebowitz

174
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:35,090
<4-12,Rachel>会忘了装底片
<4-12,Rachel>would forget to put film in the camera.

175
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,100
<4-13,Ross>请允许我们失陪一下
<4-13,Ross>Would you excuse us for a second?

176
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:44,820
<4-13,Ross>你这是要干什么
<4-13,Ross>What are you doing?

177
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:45,890
<4-14,Rachel>怎么了  我又不是你
<4-14,Rachel>What? I'm not you.

178
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:48,300
<4-14,Rachel>那可能是我唯一一场婚礼
<4-14,Rachel>This may be my only wedding I ever have.

179
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,880
<4-14,Rachel>-我希望婚礼很精彩  -好吧
<4-14,Rachel>- And I want it to be amazing. - Okay.

180
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:55,880
<4-15,Ross>或许我该骑着哈雷摩托入场
<4-15,Ross>Maybe I rode in on a Harley.

181
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,550
<4-16,Rachel>罗斯  我们得编得现实一点
<4-16,Rachel>Okay. Ross, it has to be realistic.

182
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:07,520
<5-1,Parker>你还好吗  你一直不太讲话
<5-1,Parker>Say, are you okay? You seem kind of quiet.

183
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,030
<5-2,Phoebe>我没事  我很好  我跟你在一起
<5-2,Phoebe>No, I'm fine. I'm great. I'm with you.

184
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:14,060
<5-3,Parker>而我跟你在一起  活着真好
<5-3,Parker>And I'm with you. What a great time to be alive!

185
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,960
<5-3,Parker>看看这个送盘器
<5-3,Parker>Look at this plate bouncy thing.

186
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:22,370
<5-3,Parker>这是个天才发明  解决了盘子分发的问题
<5-3,Parker>What an inspired solution to man's plate-dispensing problems.

187
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,120
<5-5,Parker>-生蚝  让我来喂你  -你不必那么做
<5-5,Parker>- Oysters! Let me feed you one. - That's not necessary.

188
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,670
<5-8,Phoebe>-拜托  -我不吃...
<5-8,Phoebe>- Please? - Actually I don't eat...

189
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:31,560
<5-9,Parker>-你不吃的话我绝不罢休  -好吧
<5-9,Parker>- I won't quit until you try one. - Okay, fine, fine.

190
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,220
<5-9,Parker>很棒
<5-9,Parker>Good.

191
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:38,430
<5-9,Parker>是什么味道  我从来没吃过
<5-9,Parker>What're they like? I've never had one.

192
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,160
<5-9,Parker>-那就尝尝看  -看起来太奇怪了
<5-9,Parker>- Why don't you just try one. - No, they look too weird.

193
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:46,660
<6-1,Chandler>你在做什么
<6-1,Chandler>What are you doing?

194
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,110
<6-2,Monica>准备致辞
<6-2,Monica>Just going over my toast.

195
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:50,830
<6-2,Monica>他们俩绝对想不到我会说什么
<6-2,Monica>Those two will never know what hit them.

196
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:53,470
<6-2,Monica>我等不及了  他们会痛哭流涕
<6-2,Monica>I can't wait. They'll cry so hard,

197
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:55,820
<6-2,Monica>以至于喘不过气来
<6-2,Monica>they'll be fighting for breath.

198
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:59,500
<6-3,Chandler>如果你需要的话  我可以按住他们  让你
<6-3,Chandler>If you want to, I could just hold them down and you could just...

199
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:06,710
<6-3,Chandler>我戴着蕾丝婚纱  由比利时盲人修女织成
<6-3,Chandler>And my veil was lace, made by blind Belgian nuns.

200
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:07,900
<7-1,Rachel>盲人
<7-1,Rachel>Blind?

201
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:11,010
<7-2,Woman>她们本来没瞎  但这份工作非常伤眼力
<7-2,Woman>Not at first, but it's very intricate work.

202
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:15,190
<7-3,Rachel>她们说虽然眼睛瞎了  但还是很值得的
<7-3,Rachel>They said even though they lost their sight, it's all worth it.

203
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,300
<7-4,Aunt Lisa>-我敢说你看起来很漂亮  -我不知道
<7-4,Aunt Lisa>- I bet you looked beautiful. - Well, I don't know about that.

204
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,730
<7-5,Rachel>但有些宾客说
<7-5,Rachel>But there were some people that said

205
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:23,360
<7-5,Rachel>我看起来像漂浮的天使
<7-5,Rachel>I looked like a floating angel.

206
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,110
<7-6,Woman>你是怎么求的婚
<7-6,Woman>How did you propose?

207
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:28,420
<7-7,Rachel>对  那个故事很精彩
<7-7,Rachel>Oh, yeah, that's a great story.

208
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:35,020
<7-8,Ross>事实上  我带她去了天文馆
<7-8,Ross>Well, actually, I took her to the planetarium.

209
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:37,850
<7-8,Ross>那是我们第一次约会的地方
<7-8,Ross>That's where we had our first date.

210
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:39,940
<7-8,Ross>她走进来
<7-8,Ross>She walked in

211
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:44,320
<7-8,Ross>我在房间里铺满了她最喜欢的百合花
<7-8,Ross>and I had the room filled with lilies, her favorite flower.

212
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,320
<7-10,Rachel>-简直太浪漫了  -我还想听完呢
<7-10,Rachel>- That is so sweet! - I want to hear the rest!

213
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:53,320
<7-11,Ross>音响系统里传出弗莱德·艾斯塔的歌声
<7-11,Ross>Then Fred Astaire singing, "The Way You Look Tonight"

214
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,390
<7-11,Ross>《你今晚的样子》  此时灯光熄灭
<7-11,Ross>came on the sound system, and the lights came down,

215
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:57,960
<7-11,Ross>我单脚跪地
<7-11,Ross>I got on one knee...

216
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:02,190
<7-11,Ross>圆顶从左至右用星星拼成一行字
<7-11,Ross>and written across the dome, in the stars, were the words:

217
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:04,050
<7-11,Ross>"你愿意嫁给我吗 "
<7-11,Ross>"Will you marry me?"

218
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,870
<7-12,Rachel>戒指有我的拳头那么大
<7-12,Rachel>And the ring was the size of my fist.

219
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:14,070
<8-1,Joey>菲比  听着
<8-1,Joey>Hey, Phoebe? Look...

220
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:19,870
<8-1,Joey>我要对你道歉  我们太不厚道了
<8-1,Joey>...I want to apologize about before. Okay? We were being jerks.

221
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:22,690
<8-1,Joey>派克人很好  我想多了解他
<8-1,Joey>Parker's a nice guy, and I'd like to get to know him.

222
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:24,070
<8-2,Phoebe>那你最好快去找他
<8-2,Phoebe>Then you better do it now.

223
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:26,380
<8-4,Phoebe>-为什么  -因为我要杀了他
<8-4,Phoebe>- Why? - Because I'm gonna kill him.

224
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,850
<8-5,Joey>-什么  -你们说得没错
<8-5,Joey>- What? What? - You guys were right.

225
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:31,760
<8-6,Phoebe>他对所有事都太热衷了
<8-6,Phoebe>He's too excited about everything.

226
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,980
<8-6,Phoebe>我也很喜欢生命
<8-6,Phoebe>I'm all for living life,

227
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:35,900
<8-6,Phoebe>但这是盖勒夫妇结婚35周年派对
<8-6,Phoebe>but this is the Gellers' 35th anniversary.

228
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:39,100
<8-6,Phoebe>我们摸着良心说话  这个派对烂透了
<8-6,Phoebe>Let's call a spade a spade. This party stinks.

229
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,540
<8-7,Joey>就是  我简直无聊到了极点
<8-7,Joey>I know. I'm having the worst time.

230
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:44,060
<8-7,Joey>那边取自助餐要排15分钟的队
<8-7,Joey>There was a 15-minute line for the buffet,

231
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,900
<8-7,Joey>等我好不容易拿到盘子
<8-7,Joey>and when I got to the plates...

232
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:48,290
<8-7,Joey>结果踩到一大坨鼻涕滑倒了
<8-7,Joey>...I slipped on a giant booger.

233
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:53,550
<8-8,Phoebe>你确定那不是生蚝吗
<8-8,Phoebe>Are you sure it wasn't an oyster?

234
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:58,270
<8-9,Joey>有可能  我没看
<8-9,Joey>It could've been. I didn't look at it.

235
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:01,500
<8-9,Joey>我把它抹在钱德勒的外套上  拔腿就溜
<8-9,Joey>I just wiped it on Chandler's coat and got the hell out.

236
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:06,740
<8-10,Phoebe>我还以为他是个好人  我对他真的很期待
<8-10,Phoebe>I thought he was a great guy. I was so excited about him.

237
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:10,500
<8-11,Joey>嘿  你应该对他充满期待
<8-11,Joey>Well, hey, you should be excited about him.

238
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,820
<8-11,Joey>他没有什么不对  他是个好人
<8-11,Joey>There's nothing wrong with him. He's a good guy.

239
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:15,200
<8-13,Joey>-真的吗  -对  你知道吗
<8-13,Joey>- You think? - Yeah, you know what I think?

240
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,160
<8-13,Joey>-我们都太悲观了  -你说得对
<8-13,Joey>- I think we were all just being too negative. - You're right.

241
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,670
<8-14,Phoebe>他只是在拥抱生命而已
<8-14,Phoebe>You're right. He's just embracing life.

242
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:24,450
<8-14,Phoebe>我们都应该向派克学习
<8-14,Phoebe>We could all stand to be a little more like Parker.

243
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:26,260
<8-14,Phoebe>你知道吗  我就跟他一样
<8-14,Phoebe>You know what? I'm like him!

244
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:28,640
<8-14,Phoebe>我是个积极乐观的人
<8-14,Phoebe>I'm a sunny, positive person!

245
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,640
<8-15,Joey>事实上  你现在稍微有点激动了
<8-15,Joey>Actually, you have a little bit of an edge.

246
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,270
<8-16,Phoebe>你小子说什么
<8-16,Phoebe>What's that now?

<8-19,Parker>-我喜欢  -是吗
<8-19,Parker>- Oh, I love it! - You do?

249
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,250
<8-20,Phoebe>开什么玩笑
<8-20,Phoebe>Are you kidding?

250
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:42,920
<8-22,Phoebe>跟着音乐学动物跳舞  来吧
<8-22,Phoebe>People acting like animals to music? Come on!

251
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,190
<9-1,Monica>好吧  该致词了
<9-1,Monica>Okay, it's time for the toast.

252
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,760
<9-1,Monica>我知道往年一向都是由罗斯来致词
<9-1,Monica>I know that normally Ross gives the toast,

253
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,090
<9-1,Monica>但今年由我来
<9-1,Monica>but this year I'm gonna do it.

254
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:57,200
<9-1,Monica>别这样  内容会很精彩
<9-1,Monica>No, it's gonna be great. Really.

255
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,170
<9-2,Monica>好的
<9-2,Monica>Okay.

256
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:04,390
<9-2,Monica>妈  爸  我结婚时
<9-2,Monica>Mom, Dad, when I got married...

257
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:08,070
<9-2,Monica>令我对婚姻充满信心的原因之一
<9-2,Monica>...one of the things that made me sure that I could do it

258
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:11,510
<9-2,Monica>就是你们这对模范夫妻为我做出的表率
<9-2,Monica>was the amazing example the two of you set for me.

259
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:15,180
<9-2,Monica>为了那一点及其他种种  我要感谢你们
<9-2,Monica>For that, and for so many other things, I want to thank you.

260
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:18,460
<9-2,Monica>这句话我或许不常说  但...
<9-2,Monica>I know I probably don't say it enough, but...

261
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,250
<9-2,Monica>我爱你们
<9-2,Monica>I love you.

262
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,900
<9-2,Monica>我环顾四周
<9-2,Monica>When I look around this room,

263
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:39,180
<9-2,Monica>想起那些无法出席的人  便心生悲伤
<9-2,Monica>I'm saddened by the thought of those who could not be with us.

264
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:41,670
<9-2,Monica>我亲爱的外婆
<9-2,Monica>Nana, my beloved grandmother,

265
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:44,380
<9-2,Monica>她肯定很想来
<9-2,Monica>who would so want to be here.

266
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,120
<9-2,Monica>但她来不了...
<9-2,Monica>But she can't...

267
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,330
<9-2,Monica>因为她死了
<9-2,Monica>...because she's dead.

268
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:56,050
<9-2,Monica>我们的狗琪琪也是一样
<9-2,Monica>As is our dog, Chi-Chi.

269
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,190
<9-2,Monica>你们看它多可爱... 那是以前的事了
<9-2,Monica>I mean, look how cute she is... was.

270
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:05,540
<9-2,Monica>帮我个忙  请把这个传给我爸妈
<9-2,Monica>Do me a favor, pass this to my parents.

271
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:11,240
<9-2,Monica>记住它死了  好吗  它和奶奶都不在了
<9-2,Monica>Remember she's dead, okay? Her and Nana, gone.

272
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:23,900
<9-2,Monica>还有谁记得...
<9-2,Monica>Does anybody remember when...

273
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,200
<9-2,Monica>黛博拉·威格在《亲蜜关系》中
<9-2,Monica>...Debra Winger had to say goodbye

274
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:28,260
<9-2,Monica>不得不跟她的孩子们说再见的样子
<9-2,Monica>to her children in Terms of Endearment?

275
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,550
<9-2,Monica>你们没看过吗
<9-2,Monica>Didn't see that?

276
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,370
<9-2,Monica>没有人爱看电影吗
<9-2,Monica>No movie fans?!

277
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,590
<9-2,Monica>你们想听些悲伤的故事吗
<9-2,Monica>You want to hear something sad?

278
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,620
<9-2,Monica>有一天我在《60分钟》
<9-2,Monica>The other day, I was watching 60 Minutes

279
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:44,530
<8-7,Joey>看到罗马尼亚孤儿院的报导
<8-7,Joey>and there was this piece on orphans in Romania...

280
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:48,930
<9-2,Monica>他们遭到抛弃  无法再爱
<9-2,Monica>...who have been so neglected that they were incapable of love.

281
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,710
<9-2,Monica>你们都是铁血心肠
<9-2,Monica>You people are made of stone!

282
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,130
<9-2,Monica>敬爸妈  随便啦
<9-2,Monica>Here's to Mom and Dad. Whatever!

283
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:12,220
<9-3,Mrs. Geller>谢谢莫妮卡  那段致辞很有意思
<9-3,Mrs. Geller>Thank you, Monica. That was interesting.

284
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:13,600
<9-3,Mrs. Geller>很有意思吧  杰克
<9-3,Mrs. Geller>Wasn't it interesting, Jack?

285
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,970
<9-4,Mr. Geller>为什么我不记得这只狗了
<9-4,Mr. Geller>Why don't I remember this dog?

286
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:22,460
<9-5,Mrs. Geller>罗斯  你为什么不为我们致词呢
<9-5,Mrs. Geller>Ross? Why don't you give us your toast now?

287
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:26,340
<9-6,Ross>不  妈  今年只有莫妮卡致辞
<9-6,Ross>Oh, no, Mom. It's just Monica this year.

288
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,560
<9-7,Mrs. Geller>在我们35周年的派对上
<9-7,Mrs. Geller>You're not saying anything?

289
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,390
<9-7,Mrs. Geller>你都不打算不致词吗
<9-7,Mrs. Geller>On our 35th wedding anniversary?

290
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,660
<9-8,Ross>当然不是
<9-8,Ross>No, of course.

291

<9-8,Ross>各位
<9-8,Ross>Everybody?

292
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:41,750
<9-8,Ross>我只想说
<9-8,Ross>I just wanted to say...

293
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:46,680
<9-8,Ross>代表我的新婚妻子瑞秋...
<9-8,Ross>...on behalf of my new bride, Rachel...

294
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:52,760
<9-8,Ross>还有我自己
<9-8,Ross>...and myself, that if...

295
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:56,280
<9-8,Ross>如果我们结婚35年后
<9-8,Ross>...if in 35 years,

296
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:59,750
<9-8,Ross>有你们一半幸福...
<9-8,Ross>we're half as happy as you guys are...

297
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:03,200
<9-8,Ross>我们会觉得自己是全世界最幸运的人
<9-8,Ross>...we'll count ourselves the luckiest people in the world.

298
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:06,260
<9-9,Mrs. Geller>罗斯
<9-9,Mrs. Geller>Oh, Ross.

299
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:13,590
<9-10,Mr. Geller>希望外婆还活着听到罗斯的致词
<9-10,Mr. Geller>I just wish Nana were alive to hear Ross' toast.

300
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:23,530
<10-1,Parker>天啊  这个走廊的灯光真漂亮
<10-1,Parker>My God, what a fantastically well-lit hallway.

301
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:29,690
<10-2,Phoebe>你要喝点东西吗   譬如水跟镇静剂
<10-2,Phoebe>Can I get you something to drink, like a water and Valium?

302
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:33,610
<10-3,Parker>我得说这间公寓...
<10-3,Parker>I must say, this apartment, it's...

303
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:35,430
<10-3,Parker>我不知道该怎么形容
<10-3,Parker>there are no words.

304
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,250
<10-4,Phoebe>-谢天谢地  -宛如天堂
<10-4,Phoebe>- Thank God. - It's a haven.

305
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,000
<10-5,Parker>位于三楼的天堂  现代伊甸国
<10-5,Parker>A third-floor paradise, a modern Eden in the midst.

306
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,530
<10-5,Parker>我知道  我了解
<10-5,Parker>Yeah, I know, I know. Gotcha.

<10-6,Phoebe>听着  我们坐下来放松一下吧
<10-6,Phoebe>Listen, why don't we just sit and relax,

308
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,520
<10-6,Phoebe>安静地彼此依偎
<10-6,Phoebe>just be with each other quietly.

309
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,250
<10-7,Parker>听起来不错
<10-7,Parker>That sounds great.

310
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:54,900
<10-7,Parker>天啊  这是我这辈子坐过
<10-7,Parker>My god. This is the most comfortable couch

311
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,450
<10-7,Parker>最舒服的沙发
<10-7,Parker>I've ever sat on in my entire life.

312
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,590
<10-8,Phoebe>我们试点别的  我们玩个游戏吧
<10-8,Phoebe>Let's try something else. Let's play a game.

313
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:02,720
<10-9,Parker>-我喜欢玩游戏  -不是吧
<10-9,Parker>- I love games. - Shocking.

314
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:06,890
<10-10,Phoebe>我们来玩...
<10-10,Phoebe>Let's play the game of...

315
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:11,060
<10-10,Phoebe>谁能最久不说话的游戏
<10-10,Phoebe>...who can stay quiet the longest.

316
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,040
<10-11,Parker>或是玩层层叠
<10-11,Parker>Or Jenga.

317
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,930
<10-12,Phoebe>我们先玩沉默游戏  记住
<10-12,Phoebe>Let's play this one first, and remember,

318
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,640
<10-12,Phoebe>先说话的人就输了
<10-12,Phoebe>whoever talks first loses.

319
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,890
<10-13,Parker>-我输了  现在来玩层层叠  -我的天啊
<10-13,Parker>- I lose, now Jenga. - Oh, my God.

320
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:31,780
<10-15,Parker>哪里不对劲吗
<10-15,Parker>Is something wrong?

321
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,810
<10-16,Phoebe>你还知道什么是"不对劲"吗
<10-16,Phoebe>Wrong? You know the word "wrong"?

322
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:36,600
<10-16,Phoebe>难道一切不是美好又神奇吗
<10-16,Phoebe>Everything isn't perfect? Everything isn't magical?

323
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:40,490
<10-16,Phoebe>难道一切不是闪耀又璀璨吗
<10-16,Phoebe>Everything isn't aglow with the light of a million fairies?

324
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:42,880
<10-16,Phoebe>那只是刹车灯而已  派克
<10-16,Phoebe>They were just brake lights, Parker!

325
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,340
<10-17,Parker>对不起我把塞车形容得如此美好
<10-17,Parker>Excuse me for putting a good spin on a traffic jam.

326
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,100
<10-18,Phoebe>你不必对所有事物都做美化
<10-18,Phoebe>You don't have to put a good spin on everything!

327
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:54,120
<10-19,Parker>抱歉  我就是这样一个乐观的人
<10-19,Parker>I'm sorry. That's who I am. I'm a positive person.

328
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,240
<10-19,Parker>不  我才是个乐观的人
<10-19,Parker>No, I'm a positive person.

329
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,910
<10-20,Phoebe>你像是吃了抗忧郁药的圣诞老人
<10-20,Phoebe>You are like Santa Claus on Prozac.

330
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,930
<10-20,Phoebe>在迪士尼乐园享受性爱
<10-20,Phoebe>At Disneyland, getting laid!

331
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:08,150
<10-21,Parker>那你想要我怎样  更悲观一些吗
<10-21,Parker>So what do you want me to do? You want me to be more negative?

332
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:09,450
<10-21,Parker>压抑心中的快乐吗
<10-21,Parker>You want me to be less happy?

333
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:11,620
<10-22,Phoebe>使劲压抑
<10-22,Phoebe>Much less happy.

334
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:16,310
<10-23,Parker>好吧  那引用罗斯的话"我最好走了"
<10-23,Parker>Fine. Well, then to quote Ross, "I better be going."

335
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,640
<10-24,Phoebe>再见
<10-24,Phoebe>So long!

336
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,650
<10-24,Phoebe>你出去的时候  别让"全世界最棒的门"
<10-24,Phoebe>Don't let the "best door in the world"

337
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,230
<10-24,Phoebe>打到屁股了
<10-24,Phoebe>hit you in the ass on your way out.

338
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:32,830
<10-25,Parker>这是你一辈子吵过最不可思议的一架吧
<10-25,Parker>Isn't this the most incredible fight you've had in your entire life?

339
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:38,810
<11-1,Ross>你坐在边车里
<11-1,Ross>And then we could've gone from the ceremony

340
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:42,190
<11-1,Ross>我们从婚礼现场走到婚宴厅
<11-1,Ross>to the reception with you in the sidecar.

341
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,030
<11-2,Rachel>那样行不通啊
<11-2,Rachel>Ross, it just wouldn't be feasible.

342
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:48,290
<11-3,Ross>鸽子叼着戒指戴到你手上
<11-3,Ross>But a dove placing the ring on your finger

343
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:50,510
<11-3,Ross>就没有问题
<11-3,Ross>would've been no problem.

344
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:54,060
<11-4,Rachel>今晚跟你结婚感觉太棒了
<11-4,Rachel>It was fun being married to you tonight.

345
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:57,980
<11-5,Ross>对  这四百块真好赚
<11-5,Ross>Yeah, and it was the easiest 400 bucks I've ever made.

346
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,780
<11-6,Rachel>-罗斯  我能问你一件事吗  -好吧
<11-6,Rachel>- Okay, Ross, can I ask you something? - Yeah.

347
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:05,190
<11-8,Rachel>在天文馆求婚
<11-8,Rachel>That proposal at the planetarium?

348
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,550
<11-9,Ross>我知道  那太蠢了
<11-9,Ross>I know, I know. It was stupid.

349
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:09,200
<11-9,Ross>开什么玩笑
<11-9,Ross>Are you kidding?

350
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:13,390
<11-10,Rachel>有百合花  那首歌  还有星星

357
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:44,010
<11-13,Ross>因为听起来那会是个昂贵的婚礼
