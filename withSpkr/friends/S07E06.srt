1
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:05,430
<1-1,Monica>我约你们来吃早午餐
<1-1,Monica>The reason I asked you guys out to brunch...

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:08,620
<1-1,Monica>是因为我一直在想首席伴娘的问题
<1-1,Monica>...is because I've been thinking about my maid of honor.

3
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:10,890
<1-2,Rachel>天啊  这一刻终于到来了
<1-2,Rachel>Oh, my God. This is it. Oh.

4

<1-5,Monica>-你们都很重要  -废话少说  到底是谁
<1-5,Monica>- You're both so important to me. - Blah, blah, blah. Who is it?

8
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,870
<1-6,Rachel>我想  我们可以想出一个办法
<1-6,Rachel>I was thinking maybe we could come up with a system...

9
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,280
<1-7,Monica>轮流当彼此的首席伴娘
<1-7,Monica>...where we trade off being maid of honor for each other.

10
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,750
<1-8,Phoebe>-假设菲比是我的首席伴娘  -太棒了
<1-8,Phoebe>- Hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine... - Yes! Oh.

11
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,850
<1-9,Rachel>那只是假设
<1-9,Rachel>Hypothetically.

12
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,150
<1-10,Phoebe>一样啦
<1-10,Phoebe>Still.

13
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:39,810
<1-11,Monica>如果菲比是我的
<1-11,Monica>If Phoebe were mine.

14
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:42,590
<1-12,Rachel>瑞秋是菲比的  我就是瑞秋的
<1-12,Rachel>Rachel would be Phoebe's, I'd be Rachel's.

15
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,360
<1-13,Monica>我们都可以当首席伴娘  大家都高兴了
<1-13,Monica>We all get to do it and no one gets upset.

16
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,900
<1-14,Rachel>-是个好主意  -可以啊  说吧是谁
<1-14,Rachel>- That's a pretty good idea. - I'll do that. So, who's yours?

17
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:54,800
<1-16,Monica>那是最棒的部分了  你们来决定
<1-16,Monica>Well, that's the best part. You guys get to decide.

18
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,980
<1-17,Phoebe>-为什么那是最棒的  -我就不必决定了
<1-17,Phoebe>- Why is that the best part? - I don't have to.

00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,580
<8-36,Phoebe>那时我们正在一起洗澡  一丝不挂
<8-36,Phoebe>...while we were showering together, naked.

245
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:50,180
<8-37,Joey>她突出了重围
<8-37,Joey>And she's back in the game!

246
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,030
<9-1,Chandler>朱莉  你好
<9-1,Chandler>Julie. Hi.

247
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,500
<9-1,Chandler>钱德勒·宾  你记得我吧
<9-1,Chandler>Chandler Bing. I guess you remember me.

248
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,800
<9-2,Julie>你好  逃兵
<9-2,Julie>Hello, Skidmark.

249
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:11,040
<9-3,Chandler>昵称  待会解释
<9-3,Chandler>It's a nickname. I'll explain later.

250
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,110
<9-4,Monica>挺明白的  不用解释
<9-4,Monica>It's pretty clear.

251
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:19,410
<9-5,Chandler>我很早以前就该跟你道歉
<9-5,Chandler>I owe you a long, overdue apology.

252
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:23,080
<9-5,Chandler>我不该因为你的体重跟你分手
<9-5,Chandler>I shouldn't have broken up with you because of your weight.

253
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:25,830
<9-6,Julie>那是你跟我分手的原因
<9-6,Julie>That's why you broke up with me?

254
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:31,270
<9-7,Chandler>你不知道
<9-7,Chandler>You didn't know that?

255
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,570
<9-7,Chandler>看来我的任务已经达成
<9-7,Chandler>Well, I guess my work here is done.

256
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:42,190
<10-1,Joey>但首先我要说
<10-1,Joey>But first of all, I would like to say

257
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:45,350
<10-1,Joey>你们两个都表现的很好
<10-1,Joey>you both performed very well, okay?

258
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,140
<10-1,Joey>你们应该觉得骄傲
<10-1,Joey>You should be proud.

259
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:49,190
<10-1,Joey>我还想说
<10-1,Joey>And I'd also like to say,

260
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:52,150
<10-1,Joey>在这场比赛里  没有人是输家
<10-1,Joey>in this competition, there are no losers.

261
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:54,690
<10-1,Joey>瑞秋除外  该死
<10-1,Joey>Well, except Rachel. Damn it!

262
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:57,840
<10-2,Phoebe>真的吗 我赢了
<10-2,Phoebe>Really? I won.

263
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,770
<10-4,Ross>-什么  -抱歉瑞秋  比分很接近
<10-4,Ross>- What? - I'm sorry, Rach, it was really close.

264
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:02,830
<10-5,Rachel>我要求重新计算
<10-5,Rachel>Well, then I demand a recount!

265
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:04,710
<10-6,Ross>其实也没有接近啦
<10-6,Ross>Actually, it wasn't that close.

266
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:08,010
<10-7,Rachel>这次试镜本身就很蠢
<10-7,Rachel>You know what? Your thing was so stupid anyway.

267
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,480
<10-7,Rachel>投硬币决定  行吗
<10-7,Rachel>We're gonna flip a coin, all right?

268
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,280
<10-7,Rachel>头
<10-7,Rachel>Heads.

269
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:16,850
<10-8,Phoebe>什么  硬币终于原谅我了
<10-8,Phoebe>What? The coins have finally forgiven me!

270
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:21,690
<10-9,Rachel>我希望莫妮卡能够在你用你那
<10-9,Rachel>Know what? I hope Monica forgives you after you throw her...

271
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:26,990
<10-9,Rachel>素食主义怪力乱神的方式向她撒花之后原谅你
<10-9,Rachel>...vegetarian-voodoo-goddess-circle-y shower.

272
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,010
<10-10,Phoebe>瑞秋  没事啦  你们最棒了
<10-10,Phoebe>Rach, it's gonna be okay. You guys are the best!

273
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:38,040
<10-11,Joey>当评审真的把我累坏了
<10-11,Joey>Boy, I tell you. That judging stuff took a lot out of me.

274
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,410
<10-12,Ross>-是吗  -没错
<10-12,Ross>- Yeah? - Yeah.

275
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:41,170
<10-13,Joey>上楼去我那里
<10-13,Joey>Thinking about maybe going upstairs

276
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:43,880
<10-13,Joey>在我沙发上睡个觉什么的吧
<10-13,Joey>and taking a little nap on my couch.

277
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:49,520
<10-14,Ross>和我有什么关系
<10-14,Ross>Why would I care about that?

278
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:53,890
<10-15,Joey>没关系啊  我就是说说
<10-15,Joey>No reason. I'm just saying that...

279
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,390
<10-15,Joey>我会在那
<10-15,Joey>...that's where I'll be.

280
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,050
<11-1,Chandler>虽然结局不如预期中理想 但我很满意自己的表现
<11-1,Chandler>As bad as that went, I actually enjoyed myself.

281
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,790
<11-1,Chandler>我想我要为我做过的
<11-1,Chandler>I think that I'm going to apologize

282
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:24,590
<11-1,Chandler>所有蠢事道歉
<11-1,Chandler>for all the stupid things that I do.

283
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:27,350
<11-2,Monica>你别做蠢事不就结了
<11-2,Monica>Why don't you just stop doing stupid things?

284
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:29,800
<11-2,Monica>你就不用道歉了
<11-2,Monica>Then you wouldn't have to apologize.

285
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,690
<11-3,Chandler>我又能道歉又能做蠢事  多好
<11-3,Chandler>I'd love it if I could do both.

286
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,660
<11-4,Monica>好了  我必须得问你
<11-4,Monica>All right, I have to ask.

287
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,160
<11-5,Chandler>什么
<11-5,Chandler>What?

288
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,770
<11-6,Monica>如果我变胖  你会和我分手吗
<11-6,Monica>Will you break up with me if I get fat?

289
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,140
<11-7,Chandler>什么
<11-7,Chandler>What?

290
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:47,640
<11-8,Monica>你和朱莉分手了  她重了多少
<11-8,Monica>You broke up with Julie. How much weight did she gain?

291
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:50,180
<11-9,Chandler>145磅
<11-9,Chandler>A hundred and forty-five pounds.

292
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:52,880
<11-10,Monica>在一年里
<11-10,Monica>In one year?

293
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:55,350
<11-10,Monica>天啊  她吃了什么  把全家人都吃了吗
<11-10,Monica>My God, what did she eat? Her family?

294
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,490
<11-10,Monica>那不是重点
<11-10,Monica>That's not the point.

295
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:00,970
<11-11,Chandler>因为这个原因和人分手
<11-11,Chandler>I know it was a stupid reason

296
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:03,650
<11-11,Chandler>很愚蠢  但是我当时才15
<11-11,Chandler>to break up with someone, but I was 15.

297
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:08,100
<11-12,Monica>不只十五岁的男孩觉得肥胖是个问题
<11-12,Monica>Yeah, well, that's not the only time this was an issue.

298
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,600
<11-12,Monica>你还记得你跟我们一起过感恩节的事吗
<11-12,Monica>You remember when you spent Thanksgiving with us?

299
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:13,900
<11-12,Monica>你也叫我胖子
<11-12,Monica>You called me fat.

300
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,300
<11-12,Monica>慢着
<11-12,Monica>Wait a minute.

301
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:18,140
<11-13,Chandler>-那完全是另一回事  -怎么说
<11-13,Chandler>- That was totally different. - How?

302
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:22,150
<11-15,Chandler>你不该听到那句话  我是偷偷说的
<11-15,Chandler>You were not supposed to hear that. I said that behind your back.

303
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:26,920
<11-16,Monica>那我怀孕了呢  我看起来会不同的
<11-16,Monica>What if I have babies, okay? I'm gonna look different.

304
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,680
<11-16,Monica>我能接受  但是我不知道你能否接受
<11-16,Monica>I'm okay with that, but I'm not sure you are.

305
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:31,490
<11-17,Chandler>你得知道
<11-17,Chandler>You have to realize

306
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:33,850
<11-17,Chandler>我没觉得你是什么苗条的大美女
<11-17,Chandler>I don't think of you as a thin, beautiful woman.

307
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:41,390
<11-17,Chandler>我可以之后再给你道歉
<11-17,Chandler>This is one of the things that I can apologize for later.

308
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:45,500
<11-17,Chandler>我的意思是  你就是莫妮卡
<11-17,Chandler>What I mean is, you're Monica.

309
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:48,770
<11-17,Chandler>我爱的就是莫妮卡
<11-17,Chandler>Okay? And I am in love with Monica.

310
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,640
<11-18,Monica>继续
<11-18,Monica>Keep going.

311
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:54,870
<11-19,Chandler>你长胖也好  变矮也好
<11-19,Chandler>So you can balloon up or you can shrink down...

312
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:57,080
<11-19,Chandler>我都会深爱你
<11-19,Chandler>...and I will still love you.

313
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:01,920
<11-20,Monica>就算我缩水到5厘米高也一样
<11-20,Monica>Even if I were to shrink down to 2 inches tall?

314
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,950
<11-21,Chandler>我会把你装在口袋里
<11-21,Chandler>I'd carry you around in my pocket.

315
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,520
<11-22,Monica>我爱你
<11-22,Monica>I love you.

316
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:13,790
<11-23,Chandler>逃兵对姑娘还是很有一手嘛
<11-23,Chandler>Skidmark still got a way with the ladies.

317
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,760
<12-1,Rachel>嗨  菲比
<12-1,Rachel>Hi, Pheebs.

318
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:19,370
<12-2,Phoebe>-嗨  -嗨
<12-2,Phoebe>- Hi. - Hi.

319
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,270
<12-3,Rachel>我想道歉
<12-3,Rachel>I just want to apologize.

320
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,880
<12-3,Rachel>我真的很抱歉我太孩子气了
<12-3,Rachel>I'm really sorry I was a baby.

321
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:27,640
<12-4,Phoebe>这太荒谬了瑞秋  我们都曾是孩子
<12-4,Phoebe>That's ridiculous. Rachel, we were all babies once.

322
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:32,380
<12-4,Phoebe>-你是说今天的事  -对
<12-4,Phoebe>- Oh, you mean today. - Yeah.

323
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:36,850
<12-5,Rachel>你应该赢的
<12-5,Rachel>Yeah, and you know, you deserve to win.

324
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:38,950
<12-5,Rachel>我一直在想这件事
<12-5,Rachel>And I was thinking about it.

325
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:42,320
<12-5,Rachel>如果你是莫妮卡的首席伴娘  那我就是你的
<12-5,Rachel>If you're Monica's maid of honor, I get to be yours.

326
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:44,620
<12-6,Phoebe>-对啊  -是
<12-6,Phoebe>- Oh, yeah. - Yeah.

327
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:48,470
<12-7,Rachel>莫妮卡和钱德勒订婚时
<12-7,Rachel>When Monica and Chandler got engaged,

328
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:50,300
<12-7,Rachel>我收集了一些材料
<12-7,Rachel>I started to put some stuff together.

329
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:53,410
<12-8,Phoebe>-以防万一  -你太好了  谢谢
<12-8,Phoebe>- Just in case. - Oh, that's so sweet. Thanks.

330
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,910
<12-9,Rachel>我知道莫妮卡很喜欢这本诗集
<12-9,Rachel>Here is a book of poetry that I know Monica loves.

331
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:59,340
<12-9,Rachel>天啊  这真有趣  你看
<12-9,Rachel>Oh, God, this is funny. Look.

332
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:00,970
<12-9,Rachel>这是一年万圣节
<12-9,Rachel>Here's a picture from one Holloween

333
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:03,350
<12-9,Rachel>她打扮成新娘的样子
<12-9,Rachel>where she dressed up as a bride.

334
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:05,180
<12-9,Rachel>她要我帮她拉裙摆
<12-9,Rachel>She made me carry her train...

335
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:08,510
<12-9,Rachel>那真的很奇怪  因为我扮的是神力女超人
<12-9,Rachel>...which was weird because I was Wonder Woman.

336
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:12,920
<12-9,Rachel>我还发现了个小包包
<12-9,Rachel>Oh, and here's a little purse that I found.

337
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,990
<12-9,Rachel>我想他们能把戒指放在这里面
<12-9,Rachel>I just thought they could hold the rings in there.

338
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,860
<12-10,Phoebe>-哦  -还有
<12-10,Phoebe>- Oh. - And...

339
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,800
<12-11,Rachel>复古式手帕
<12-11,Rachel>...vintage handkerchiefs,

340
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,630
<12-11,Rachel>人们总在婚礼上泪流满面
<12-11,Rachel>you know, because people cry at weddings.

341
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:26,270
<12-11,Rachel>我就要用个几条
<12-11,Rachel>I'm just gonna grab a couple of these.

342
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:29,770
<12-12,Phoebe>这手绢真不错
<12-12,Phoebe>This stuff is great.

343
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:32,340
<12-13,Rachel>我都忘了这个了
<12-13,Rachel>I forgot this was in here.

344
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,410
<12-13,Rachel>这是我留下来要在自己婚礼上用的吊袜带
<12-13,Rachel>This was the garter that I was saving for my wedding.

345
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:42,350
<12-13,Rachel>莫妮卡可以拿这个当"借别人的东西"
<12-13,Rachel>And I wanted it to be Monica's "Something borrowed."

347
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,350
<12-13,Rachel>还是蓝色的
<12-13,Rachel>And it's blue.

348
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:53,790
<12-14,Phoebe>瑞秋  我觉得你应该当首席伴娘
<12-14,Phoebe>Rach, I think that you should be Monica's maid of honor.

349
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:57,360
<12-15,Rachel>是吗
<12-15,Rachel>You do?

350
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:01,540
<12-16,Phoebe>-为什么  -因为这对你来说意义更加重大
<12-16,Phoebe>- Why? - Because I think it means more to you.

351
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,710
<12-17,Rachel>但菲比  你赢了比赛
<12-17,Rachel>But, Pheebs, honey, you earned it.

352
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:07,040
<12-18,Phoebe>没事  我是说  这可是自你
<12-18,Phoebe>It's fine. I mean, this is something...

353
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:10,910
<12-18,Phoebe>14岁以来的梦想啊
<12-18,Phoebe>...that you've been thinking about since you were, what, 14?

354
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:14,240
<12-19,Rachel>我才十岁  发育早而已
<12-19,Rachel>No, I was 10. I just developed early.

355
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:17,050
<12-20,Phoebe>天啊
<12-20,Phoebe>Man alive!

356
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:21,760
<12-22,Rachel>-嗨  都好吗  -嗨
<12-22,Rachel>- Hey, what's going on? - Hey!

357
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,060
<12-23,Phoebe>我们刚刚决定瑞秋会是你的首席伴娘
<12-23,Phoebe>We decided Rachel is going to be your maid of honor.

358
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,800
<13-1,Joey>太好了
