1
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:10,660
<1-3,Phoebe>有多少人会来参加宝宝的欢迎会
<1-3,Phoebe>So, what's the final head count on my baby shower?

2
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,920
<1-4,Rachel>大约有20个人  有些同事有事没空过来
<1-4,Rachel>About twenty. Couple people from work had something else to do.

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,220
<1-6,Monica>你的妹妹们打电话来说她们没办法来
<1-6,Monica>Also both of your sisters called and neither can make it.

4
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:18,940
<1-7,Rachel>什么  她们竟然不来参加
<1-7,Rachel>What? You mean they're not coming to a social event

5
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:20,850
<1-7,Rachel>没有男人跟酒精的社交聚会
<1-7,Rachel>where there's no men and no booze?

6
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,430
<1-7,Rachel>那真的是太稀奇了
<1-7,Rachel>That's shocking.

7
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:25,790
<1-7,Rachel>我不在乎  只要我妈能来就行了
<1-7,Rachel>I don't care, as long as my mom's here.

8
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,180
<1-8,Monica>天啊  你妈
<1-8,Monica>Oh, my God. Your mother.

9
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:29,800
<1-9,Rachel>怎么  我妈不会来吗
<1-9,Rachel>What? My mom's not gonna be here?

10
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,930
<1-10,Monica>由于我们忘了邀请她
<1-10,Monica>Well, given that we forgot to invite her,

11
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:34,610
<1-10,Monica>她要是能来那还真是天大的巧合呢
<1-10,Monica>it would be a big coincidence if she was.

12
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:36,690
<1-11,Rachel>我的天啊
<1-11,Rachel>My God!

13
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,890
<1-12,Monica>不是我的错  负责邀请来宾的是菲比
<1-12,Monica>It wasn't my fault, Phoebe was in charge of the invitations.

14
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,760
<1-13,Phoebe>我没有妈妈  所以我常忘了
<1-13,Phoebe>I don't have a mother. So often I forget...

15
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,470
<1-14,Monica>少来了你
<1-14,Monica>Oh, give it a rest.

16
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:48,660
<1-15,Rachel>所以说我妈不来参加宝宝的欢迎会吗
<1-15,Rachel>So my mother is not coming to my baby shower?

17
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:49,830
<1-15,Rachel>对
<1-15,Rachel>No.

18
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,280
<1-16,Phoebe>我妈也不会来
<1-16,Phoebe>Neither is mine.

19
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,720
<1-16,Phoebe>你别着急
<1-16,Phoebe>You know what? Don't worry.

20
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,420
<1-17,Monica>我们会处理的  我们会打电话给她
<1-17,Monica>We'll take care of it. We'll call her.

21
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,350
<1-17,Monica>你先回家做准备
<1-17,Monica>You go home and get ready.

22
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,990
<1-18,Rachel>确定她一定会来  这对我很重要  她是我妈
<1-18,Rachel>Please, make sure she comes. It's really important to me. It's my mom.

23
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:04,890
<1-19,Phoebe>-我知道  她电话号码是多少  -我不知道
<1-19,Phoebe>- I know. What's her number? - I don't know.

24
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,700
<1-20,Rachel>你去吧  我记在我的电话簿里了
<1-20,Rachel>Go. I have it in my book. Go.

25
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:16,570
<1-21,Monica>等等  如果你负责邀请来宾
<1-21,Monica>Wait a minute. If you're in charge of invitations,

26
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:18,080
<1-21,Monica>那为什么是我打电话给她
<1-21,Monica>why am I the one who has to call her?

27
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,520
<1-21,Monica>喂  格林太太  我是莫妮卡·盖勒
<1-21,Monica>Hello, Mrs. Green! Hi, it's Monica Geller.

<1-23,Monica>我知道时间紧促
<1-23,Monica>I know this is last-minute,

30
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:27,410
<1-23,Monica>我们打算在今天临时
<1-23,Monica>but we've decided to throw an impromptu...

<1-23,Monica>帮瑞秋的宝宝办欢迎会
<1-23,Monica>...baby shower for Rachel today.

32

<1-24,Mrs. Green>我的女儿们已经告诉我了
<1-24,Mrs. Green>I know, my daughter's told me about it

33
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:35,040
<1-24,Mrs. Green>她们一个月前就接到欢迎会的"临时"请帖了
<1-24,Mrs. Green>when they received their impromptu invitations a month ago.

<1-26,Mrs. Green>For what, dear?

36
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:42,580
<1-26,Mrs. Green>为了没有邀请我  还是说谎骗我呢
<1-26,Mrs. Green>For not inviting me, or for lying about it?

37
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,010
<1-27,Monica>天啊  我的屁股在流汗
<1-27,Monica>Oh, my God! My ass is sweating.

117
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:48,740
<4-3,Mrs. Green>因为那样她会分心的

<4-4,Rachel>事实上  我不打算请奶妈

<4-5,Mrs. Green>你不知道带孩子有多累
<4-5,Mrs. Green>You don't know how overwhelming this is gonna be.

123
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:04,550
<4-5,Mrs. Green>你小时候我雇用了凯太太
<4-5,Mrs. Green>I mean when you were a baby I had full time help, I had Mrs. Kay.

124

<4-6,Rachel>凯太太  对  她人真的很好
<4-6,Rachel>Mrs. K! Oh, yeah, she was sweet.

125
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,110
<4-6,Rachel>她还教过我西班牙文
<4-6,Rachel>She taught me Spanish.

126
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:11,110
<4-6,Rachel>我大概还记得一点
<4-6,Rachel>I actually think I remember some of it.

127
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:14,610
<4-6,Rachel>你妈是个疯婆子
<4-6,Rachel>Tu madre esta loca.

128
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:18,590
<4-7,Mrs. Green>她真是个好人
<4-7,Mrs. Green>Such a sweet woman.

129
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:22,400
<4-8,Rachel>她真的很棒  但我出不起那笔钱
<4-8,Rachel>As great as she was, I can't afford that.

130
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,000
<4-10,Rachel>瑞秋  我想到一个好点子
<4-10,Rachel>Rachel, I just had the greatest idea!

131
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,030
<4-11,Mrs. Green>我要搬过去跟你们住

<4-13,Mrs. Green>看看你  你感动得都快哭了
<4-13,Mrs. Green>Look at you. You have tears in your eyes.

135
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,870
<4-14,Rachel>没错  我是快哭了
<4-14,Rachel>Yes, yes, I do.

136
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,200
<4-14,Rachel>罗斯  现在是你领先
<4-14,Rachel>Ross, you're in the lead.

137
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,410
<5-1,Joey>你要再回答一题
<5-1,Joey>Would you like to take another question

138
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:50,600
<5-1,Joey>或旋转处罚轮
<5-1,Joey>or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?

139
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:53,370
<5-2,Ross>今天我转轮子的运气不太好  乔伊
<5-2,Ross>The Wheel has not been my friend tonight, Joey.

140
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,610
<5-2,Ross>我要再回答一题
<5-2,Ross>I'll take another question.

141

<5-3,Joey>好吧  这题很难  屏住呼吸
<5-3,Joey>Okay. This is gonna be tough. Hold your breath.

142
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,890
<5-4,Ross>没关系  我准备好了
<5-4,Ross>It's okay. I'm ready.

143
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,450
<5-5,Joey>不  哥们  在你回答问题之前
<5-5,Joey>No dude, you gotta hold your breath

144
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:03,510
<5-5,Joey>要一直屏住呼吸
<5-5,Joey>until you're ready to answer the question.

145
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,480
<5-5,Joey>这是游戏规则
<5-5,Joey>This is part of the game.

146
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,550
<5-6,Chandler>这太可笑了  他没法屏住...
<5-6,Chandler>This is ridiculous! He's not gonna hold his...

147
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,620
<5-7,Joey>好吧  如果你患有这种恐惧症
<5-7,Joey>Okay. What do you have a fear of

148
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:14,930
<5-7,Joey>那你害怕的是什么  恐...

149
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:18,140
<5-7,Joey>天啊  那个词真长  恐...
<5-7,Joey>Holy cow. That's a big word. Trisk...

150
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,880
<5-7,Joey>看看这个词  钱德勒  这该怎么念
<5-7,Joey>Seriously, look at this. Chandler, how do you say that?

151
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,880
<5-8,Chandler>-让我看看  -就是这个词
<5-8,Chandler>- Let me see that. - This one right here.

152
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:29,110
<5-11,Ross>-恐十三症  -害怕薄脆饼干
<5-11,Ross>- Triskaidekaphobia. - Fear of Triscuits!

153
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,800
<5-12,Joey>-不  是害怕数字十三  -害怕薄脆饼干
<5-12,Joey>- No! No. Fear of the number 13. - Fear of Triscuits?

154
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,370
<5-14,Ross>这有可能  饼干的边缘很锋利的
<5-14,Ross>It's possible. They have really sharp edges.

155
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,050
<5-15,Joey>钱德勒  轮到你了
<5-15,Joey>Alright, Chandler, you're up.

156
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:43,750
<5-16,Ross>等等  我可以用天使通行证换一次答题机会
<5-16,Ross>Wait a minute. I'm entitled to use my Angel Pass for a free turn.

157
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,760
<5-17,Chandler>这个游戏真的很没有道理
<5-17,Chandler>This game makes no sense!

158
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,260
<5-18,Ross>你生气是因为你要输了
<5-18,Ross>You're upset because you're losing.

159
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,340
<5-19,Chandler>少来了  罗斯  我觉得我们都是失败者
<5-19,Chandler>Oh, come on, Ross. I think we're all losers here.

160
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,130
<5-19,Chandler>好  钱德勒
<5-19,Chandler>Alright, Chandler.

00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:56,790
<5-20,Joey>你可以选旋转轮子或挑一张搜索卡
<5-20,Joey>You can either spin the Wheel or pick a Google Card.

162
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:58,240
<5-21,Chandler>让我想想
<5-21,Chandler>Let me think, let me think.

163
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,120
<5-21,Chandler>我不在乎
<5-21,Chandler>Oh, I don't care.

<5-22,Joey>You must choose, Mr. Bing.

165
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:05,790
<5-23,Chandler>那还是没有差别
<5-23,Chandler>Either. It makes no difference.

166
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,180
<5-24,Joey>快选吧  混蛋

<5-26,Joey>-你拿到了罗斯所有的分数  -什么
<5-26,Joey>- You get all of Ross' points! - What?

169
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,550
<5-28,Chandler>这个游戏开始好玩起来了
<5-28,Chandler>This game is kind of fun!

170
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:23,340
<5-29,Ross>你不觉得你拿到我的分数太疯狂了...
<5-29,Ross>You don't think it's a little crazy that you get all my points...

171
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:26,540
<5-30,Chandler>参赛者不该相互交谈的
<5-30,Chandler>I don't think the contestants aren't supposed to speak to each other.

172
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:33,440
<6-1,Rachel>-你为什么要邀请我妈来  -什么
<6-1,Rachel>- Why did you invite my mother? - What?

173
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,000
<6-3,Rachel>她要搬过来跟我和罗斯住
<6-3,Rachel>She wants to move in with me and Ross

174
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,720
<6-3,Rachel>以便帮忙照顾宝宝
<6-3,Rachel>to help take care of the baby.

00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:39,540
<6-4,Phoebe>-多久  -八星期

<6-5,Rachel>我爱我妈
<6-5,Rachel>I love my mother,

177
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:43,400
<6-5,Rachel>但是跟她一起吃长午餐就是种折磨
<6-5,Rachel>but, my God, a long lunch with her is taxing.

178
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:47,260
<6-6,Monica>如果她想跟我住  我会觉得很荣幸
<6-6,Monica>I personally would be honored if she wanted to live with me.

179
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,830
<6-7,Phoebe>她又听不到你拍马屁
<6-7,Phoebe>She can't hear you.

180
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:52,710
<6-8,Rachel>我该怎么样
<6-8,Rachel>What am I gonna do?

181
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:56,470
<6-9,Phoebe>如果不希望她搬过去  你该直说
<6-9,Phoebe>If you don't want your mother to move in with you, just tell her.

182
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:00,190
<6-10,Rachel>你说得对  我就快生了
<6-10,Rachel>You're right. You're right. I'm about to have a baby.

183
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:01,590
<6-10,Rachel>我可以说我不希望她
<6-10,Rachel>I can tell my mother that I don't want her

184
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:03,520
<6-10,Rachel>睡在我家沙发上
<6-10,Rachel>to just be sleeping on my couch!

185
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,520
<6-10,Rachel>她会睡在我床上 绝不能让那种事发生
<6-10,Rachel>She'll wanna sleep in my bed with me. This can't happen.

186
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,030
<6-11,Monica>没错
<6-11,Monica>That's right. That is right.

187
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,020
<6-11,Monica>你去告诉她
<6-11,Monica>You go over there and tell her

188
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:11,030
<6-11,Monica>你不希望她搬过去跟你们住
<6-11,Monica>you don't want her to live with you.

189
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:13,750
<6-11,Monica>-一定要坚持立场  -好
<6-11,Monica>- Do not take no for an answer. - Okay.

190
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,860
<6-13,Monica>这简直太棒了  现在她会生瑞秋的气
<6-13,Monica>This is great! Now she's gonna be mad at Rachel!

191
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,280
<6-13,Monica>我要趁虚而入
<6-13,Monica>And I'm just gonna swoop in there

192
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,720
<6-13,Monica>当她的乖女儿讨好她
<6-13,Monica>and be like the daughter she never had.

193
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:27,430
<6-14,Phoebe>我对钱德勒又产生了新的敬意
<6-14,Phoebe>I have new respect for Chandler.

194
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:32,870
<6-14,Phoebe>好了  大伙们  该来拆礼物了
<6-14,Phoebe>All right, everybody! It's time to open the presents!

195
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:37,410
<6-15,Monica>对  瑞秋要拆的第一样礼物...
<6-15,Monica>Yes! I think the first gift that Rachel opens...

196
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,070
<6-15,Monica>应该是外婆送的礼物
<6-15,Monica>...should be from the grandmother of the baby.

197
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:42,760
<6-15,Monica>因为你是这里最重要的人
<6-15,Monica>Because you're the most important person in this room!

198
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,720
<6-15,Monica>也是全世界最重要的人
<6-15,Monica>And in the world!

199
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,090
<6-16,Mrs. Green>我没有准备礼物
<6-16,Mrs. Green>I don't have a gift

200
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:49,870
<6-16,Mrs. Green>因为我直到最后时刻才受到邀请
<6-16,Mrs. Green>because I wasn't invited until the last minute.

201
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,180
<6-16,Mrs. Green>但非常谢谢你  亲爱的
<6-16,Mrs. Green>But thank you so much, dear,

202
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,250
<6-16,Mrs. Green>让大家都注意到这一点
<6-16,Mrs. Green>for bringing that to everybody's attention.

203
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,440
<6-17,Phoebe>你们这些不太重要的人呢
<6-17,Phoebe>How about you less important people?

204
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,500
<6-17,Phoebe>我们来拆你们的礼物吧
<6-17,Phoebe>Let's open your presents!

205
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,760
<6-18,Rachel>你没准备礼物也没关系
<6-18,Rachel>It's okay that you didn't get me a gift.

206
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,340
<6-19,Mrs. Green>但我也算是送了你一样礼物
<6-19,Mrs. Green>I kind of did.

207
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,690
<6-19,Mrs. Green>我要跟你同住八个星期
<6-19,Mrs. Green>Me! Eight weeks of me.

208
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:12,810
<6-20,Rachel>好吧  妈  事实上我可以自己照顾宝宝
<6-20,Rachel>Okay. See, Mom, the truth is, I can do this on my own.

209
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:15,770
<6-21,Mrs. Green>宝贝  我知道你会是个好妈妈
<6-21,Mrs. Green>Sweet heart, I know you're gonna be a terrific mom.

210
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:18,790
<6-21,Mrs. Green>但我觉得一开始你还是需要有人帮忙
<6-21,Mrs. Green>I just think you need a little help, especially at the beginning.

211
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,680
<6-22,Rachel>我知道自己在做什么  我应付得来
<6-22,Rachel>But mom, I really know what I'm doing. I can handle this.

212
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,850
<6-23,Mrs. Green>真的吗  还记得亮亮吗
<6-23,Mrs. Green>Really? Remember Twinkles?

213
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:27,330
<6-24,Rachel>他是只仓鼠  我又不会拿吸尘器吸我的宝宝
<6-24,Rachel>He was a hamster. I'm not gonna vacuum up my baby!

214
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:31,440
<6-25,Phoebe>快来吧  瑞秋  拆礼物的时间到了
<6-25,Phoebe>Okay, come on, Rach. It's present time!

215
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,650
<6-25,Phoebe>你是这个派对的主角
<6-25,Phoebe>You're the glue holding this party together.

216
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,630
<6-25,Phoebe>现在这个派对也快毁了
<6-25,Phoebe>It's kind of falling apart here.

<6-26,Mrs. Green>-你看  -哇

222
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,100
<6-29,Rachel>不可能啊
<6-29,Rachel>That can't be right.

223
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,820
<6-29,Rachel>这是宝宝啤酒机吗
<6-29,Rachel>Is that a beer bong for a baby?

224
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,730
<6-30,Mrs. Green>女儿  那是挤奶器
<6-30,Mrs. Green>Darling, that's a breast pump.

225
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:04,260
<6-31,Rachel>我说过我猜完了吗
<6-31,Rachel>Did I say I was done guessing?

<6-33,Rachel>-是尿布精灵  -是用来放干净尿布的
<6-33,Rachel>- It's a Diaper Genie. - It dispenses clean diapers!

229
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,390
<6-34,Woman>那是放脏尿布的
<6-34,Woman>No. It's where you put dirty ones.

230
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,140
<6-35,Rachel>真恶心  为什么不直接把脏尿布
<6-35,Rachel>That's gross. Why don't you take it outside

231
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,500
<6-35,Rachel>丢在外面的垃圾桶里
<6-35,Rachel>and throw it in a dumpster?

232
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,220
<6-36,Mrs. Green>你每天要丢十次吗
<6-36,Mrs. Green>You're gonna do that 10 times a day?

<6-37,Rachel>什么  宝宝一天可以拉十次
<6-37,Rachel>What, it goes 10 times a day?

234
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,180
<6-37,Rachel>难道我们给她喂的是印度食物吗
<6-37,Rachel>Are we feeding this baby Indian food?

235
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:31,390
<6-38,Mrs. Green>不  宝宝都是那样的
<6-38,Mrs. Green>No, dear. That's what babies do.

236
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:35,170
<6-39,Monica>瑞秋  听你妈妈的话  她非常聪明

<10-8,Rachel>Oh, no? Pheebs, Monica, do I know anything about babies?

351
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:22,760
<10-9,Phoebe>-啥都不会  -令人发指
<10-9,Phoebe>- No. Not a thing. - It's frightening.

<10-10,Monica>就算她不会  但是我会
<10-10,Monica>Even if she doesn't know anything, I do.

353
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:30,300
<10-11,Ross>我有个儿子  他妈妈跟我没有住在一起
<10-11,Ross>I have a son. His mother and I didn't live together.

354
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:34,470
<10-11,Ross>他跟我一起住时  我都是自己照顾他
<10-11,Ross>When he was with me, I took care of him all the time, by myself.

355
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:38,480
<10-12,Mrs. Green>-没错  你还有一个孩子  -对
<10-12,Mrs. Green>- That's true. You do have another child. - Yeah.

<10-13,Ross>跟另一个女人生的

<10-14,Mrs. Green>你没有自制力吗  罗斯
<10-14,Mrs. Green>Have you no control, Ross?

358
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:48,280
<10-15,Ross>那是另一个问题
<10-15,Ross>That's a different issue.

359
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:51,890
<10-15,Ross>重点是宝宝出生后
<10-15,Ross>The point is, when the baby comes,

360

<10-15,Ross>我会帮忙喂她吃饭

<10-21,Ross>新手妈妈都会有那种感觉
<10-21,Ross>Every first-time mother feels that way.

<10-21,Ross>你是个被宠坏的无助小女孩
<10-21,Ross>...you were this spoiled, helpless little girl

371
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:33,810
<10-21,Ross>只会用爸爸的信用卡  记得吗
<10-21,Ross>who still used Daddy's credit cards, remember?

384
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:16,000
<10-31,Phoebe>没什么  你跟她道过很多次歉了
<10-31,Phoebe>Nothing. You have apologized to her, like, a million times.

385
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,200
<10-31,Phoebe>结果她对你的态度还是一样恶劣
<10-31,Phoebe>And she's been nothing but terrible to you.

386
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:20,470
<10-31,Phoebe>别忘了  你刚刚帮她女儿
<10-31,Phoebe>And don't forget, you just threw her daughter

387
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:24,250
<10-31,Phoebe>办了个稍显无聊的温馨欢迎会
<10-31,Phoebe>a lovely, albeit slightly boring, shower.

388
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:27,580
<10-31,Phoebe>她甚至都没有谢谢你
<10-31,Phoebe>And she hasn't even thanked you for it.

389
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:29,730
<10-32,Monica>你说得对
<10-32,Monica>You know what? You're right.

390

395
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:45,980
<10-34,Monica>不跟主人道别就离开派对是很无礼的
<10-34,Monica>It is rude to leave a party without saying goodbye to the host.

396
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:48,430
<10-36,Monica>如果有人跟你道歉
<10-36,Monica>And also, when someone apologizes to you,

397
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:50,760
<10-36,Monica>得体的做法是接受道歉
<10-36,Monica>the decent thing to do is to accept it.

398
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,330
<10-36,Monica>我对你的所作所为并非故意
<10-36,Monica>Because what I did to you, it wasn't on purpose!

399
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:57,100
<10-36,Monica>但你对我的态度太恶毒了
<10-36,Monica>But what you're doing to me now is plain spiteful.

400
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,840
<10-37,Mrs. Green>-恶毒  -没错
<10-37,Mrs. Green>- Spiteful? - That's right.

00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:08,950
<10-39,Phoebe>别说了
<10-39,Phoebe>Wrap it up. Wrap it up. Wrap it up.

405
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:14,810
<10-40,Monica>只要你准备好跟我道歉  我会原谅你的
<10-40,Monica>So whenever you're ready to apologize to me, I will forgive you.
