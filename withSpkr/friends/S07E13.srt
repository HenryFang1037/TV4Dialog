<1-4,Rachel>-你在做什么  -我想把沙发搬开
<1-4,Rachel>- What are you doing? - I was thinking of moving the couch.

3
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:12,150
<1-5,Joey>怎么突发奇想要搬沙发了
<1-5,Joey>Why would you want to do that?

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:15,560
<1-6,Rachel>我想要个好位置坐
<1-6,Rachel>So there'd be a decent place for me to sit?

5
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:20,540
<1-7,Joey>-瑞秋你本来就有好位置坐  -你的大腿不算
<1-7,Joey>- Rach, there is a decent place. - And your lap does not count.

6

<1-8,Rachel>-来吧  帮我把它搬开  -不

8
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,900
<1-11,Joey>罗西塔哪也不去
<1-11,Joey>Rosita does not move.

9

<1-12,Rachel>抱歉  罗西塔  是哪位
<1-12,Rachel>I'm sorry. Rosita? As in...?

10
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,340
<1-13,Joey>就是哪也不去的那位
<1-13,Joey>As in "Rosita does not move."

11
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,670
<1-14,Rachel>就是张椅子  有什么大不了的
<1-14,Rachel>It's just a chair. What's the big deal?

12
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,750
<1-15,Joey>它到浴室跟到厨房的距离是一样的
<1-15,Joey>It's the exact equal distance from the bathroom to the kitchen...

13
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:43,950
<1-15,Joey>而且它所在的角度
<1-15,Joey>...and it's at an angle

14
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,280
<1-15,Joey>使得史迪威不会反光
<1-15,Joey>where you don't get any glare coming off Stevie.

15
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:50,460
<1-16,Rachel>电视史迪威
<1-16,Rachel>Stevie the TV?

00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,500
<1-17,Joey>-有问题  -没有
<1-17,Joey>- Is there a problem? - No.

17
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,320
<1-18,Rachel>他又知道什么
<1-18,Rachel>What does he know?

18
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,590
<1-18,Rachel>来吧罗西塔  辣妹得万众一心才行
<1-18,Rachel>Come on, Rosita. Us chicas gotta stick together.

19
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,610
<1-18,Rachel>你个贱人啊
<1-18,Rachel>You bitch!

31
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,120
<2-4,Monica>罗斯
<2-4,Monica>Hey, Ross?

32
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:56,800
<2-5,Ross>我看了地产广告版
<2-5,Ross>I checked the real estate section.

33
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:58,770
<2-6,Monica>看这个
<2-6,Monica>Look at this.

34
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:00,700
<2-7,Ross>看上去像是爸妈的房子
<2-7,Ross>Looks like Mom and Dad's house.

35
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:04,340
<2-7,Ross>连院子里面前方树枝断掉的树都一样
<2-7,Ross>Even has a tree with a broken limb out front.

36
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:08,410
<2-8,Phoebe>阁楼的窗户
<2-8,Phoebe>And the window in the attic...

37
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,880
<2-8,Phoebe>天啊
<2-8,Phoebe>Oh, my God!

38
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:14,350
<2-8,Phoebe>阁楼的窗户怎么了
<2-8,Phoebe>What happened to the window in the attic?

39
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,640
<2-9,Monica>我不敢相信他们要把它卖掉
<2-9,Monica>I can't believe they're selling it.

40
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,020
<2-10,Ross>我不敢相信他们都没告诉我们
<2-10,Ross>I can't believe they didn't even tell us.

41
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:19,980
<2-11,Phoebe>我不敢相信我还是不知道
<2-11,Phoebe>I can't believe I still don't know

42
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,820
<3-1,Rachel>阁楼的窗户到底怎么了
<3-1,Rachel>what happened to the window in the attic?

43
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,190
<3-2,Joey>我会买张新椅子赔你  好吗
<3-2,Joey>I'll buy you a new one, okay?

44
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:30,030
<3-3,Rachel>我们现在就去家具店  我立刻给你买张新的
<3-3,Rachel>We'll go to the store and get you a new chair right now.

45
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:35,310
<3-4,Joey>她都还尸骨未寒呢
<3-4,Joey>She's not even cold yet.

46
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,380
<3-5,Rachel>罗西塔也会希望你能继续生活的
<3-5,Rachel>Wouldn't Rosita have wanted you to move on?

47
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:45,310
<3-5,Rachel>她总以你为先
<3-5,Rachel>I mean, you know, she did always put your comfort first.

48
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,740
<3-6,Joey>没错
<3-6,Joey>That's true.

49
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:54,570
<4-1,Ross>我不敢相信我们要向
<4-1,Ross>I can't believe we have to say goodbye

50
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:56,770
<4-1,Ross>承载我们成长记忆的房子说再见了
<4-1,Ross>to the house we grew up in.

51
00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:00,380
<4-1,Ross>陌生人就要搬进我的房间里
<4-1,Ross>Man, some stranger's gonna be in my room.

52
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,550
<4-2,Monica>15年来  他们把你的房间搞得和神龛一样
<4-2,Monica>For 15 years they kept it as a shrine to you.

53
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,720
<4-2,Monica>是时候把紫罗兰绳子撤下来了
<4-2,Monica>It's time the velvet ropes came down.

54
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,530
<4-3,Ross>他们也为你保留了房间
<4-3,Ross>They kept your room a while.

55
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:10,710
<4-4,Monica>拜托  我搬出去才不过20分钟
<4-4,Monica>Please! Dad turned my room

56
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:13,590
<4-4,Monica>爸爸就把我的房间改造成健身房了
<4-4,Monica>into a gym 20 minutes after I moved out.

57
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,630
<4-4,Monica>我必须得说 美黑床
<4-4,Monica>I gotta say, a tanning bed

58
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,740
<4-4,Monica>外加一堆维多利亚秘密的内衣目录
<4-4,Monica>and a stack of Victoria's Secret catalogs?

59
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,250
<4-4,Monica>才不是健身房
<4-4,Monica>Not a gym.

60
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,260
<4-5,Ross>别这样  你知道他们爱你
<4-5,Ross>Come on. You know they love you.

61
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,520
<4-6,Monica>就跟他们爱你一样吗
<4-6,Monica>As much as they love you?

62
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,020
<4-7,Ross>我是头胎嘛
<4-7,Ross>I was their first born.

63
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,290
<4-7,Ross>在生我之前  他们都以为她不能生育
<4-7,Ross>They thought she was barren until I was born.

64
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,050
<4-7,Ross>又不是我的错
<4-7,Ross>It's not my fault.

65
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:33,030
<4-9,Ross>今年真讨厌
<4-9,Ross>I hate this year.

66
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,430
<4-11,Phoebe>今年怎么了
<4-11,Phoebe>What's wrong with this year?

67
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:37,850
<4-13,Phoebe>都二月了  我只给两位客人做过按摩
<4-13,Phoebe>It's February and I've only given two massages...

68
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,960
<4-13,Phoebe>而且他们给小费都给得很吝啬
<4-13,Phoebe>...and they were both worst tippers in the world.

69
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,010
<4-14,Monica>你是指我跟罗斯
<4-14,Monica>That was me and Ross.

70
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,400
<4-15,Phoebe>哦  没错
<4-15,Phoebe>Oh, that's right.

71
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,990
<4-16,Ross>如果你需要钱
<4-16,Ross>If you want some extra cash...

72
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:52,390
<4-16,Ross>我大学的朋友做电话行销赚了不少钱
<4-16,Ross>...some college friends made good money doing telemarketing.

73
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:55,400
<4-17,Monica>这次应该比我上次做有关电话的工作强
<4-17,Monica>It'd be better than the last telephone job I had.

74
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,350
<4-18,Phoebe>我大概不必常常说"打我屁股吧"
<4-18,Phoebe>I probably won't have to say "Spank" As much.

75
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,040
<4-19,Ross>什么
<4-19,Ross>What?

76
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:07,380
<4-20,Phoebe>对  你从来没打过那种电话
<4-20,Phoebe>Oh, yeah, like you never called.

77
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:16,830
<5-1,Supervisor>真的很简单  你只要照着稿子念
<5-1,Supervisor>This is very easy. You read from the script...

78
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:19,510
<5-1,Supervisor>试着多卖几盒墨盒
<5-1,Supervisor>...and try to sell as much toner as you can.

79
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,180
<5-2,Phoebe>我没问题的
<5-2,Phoebe>Okay, I can do that.

80
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:24,620
<5-2,Phoebe>对了  我喜欢我的办公室
<5-2,Phoebe>By the way, I love my office.

81
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:28,300
<5-3,Supervisor>-我们练习一下吧  -好啊
<5-3,Supervisor>- Why don't we do a trial run? - Oh, okay.

82
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,940
<5-3,Supervisor>好
<5-3,Supervisor>All right.

83
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:35,390
<5-4,Phoebe>我是帝国办公室文具公司的菲比
<5-4,Phoebe>Hi, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies.

<5-4,Phoebe>- Can I speak to your supply manager? - I'm the supply manager.

85
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,630
<5-6,Phoebe>能谈谈你们的墨盒需求吗
<5-6,Phoebe>I'd like to talk about your toner needs.

86
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:42,800
<5-7,Supervisor>我们不需要墨盒
<5-7,Supervisor>We don't need any toner.

87
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,440
<5-8,Phoebe>抱歉打扰你  再见
<5-8,Phoebe>Okay, sorry to bother you. Bye-bye.

88
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,200
<5-8,Phoebe>你说对了  确实很容易
<5-8,Phoebe>Yeah, you're right. This is easy.

89

00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:56,090
<5-10,Phoebe>恕我冒昧  你很粗鲁
<5-10,Phoebe>No offense, but you were kind of rude.

92
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:00,620
<5-11,Supervisor>他们总是说不需要墨盒  没关系
<5-11,Supervisor>They always say they don't need toner. That's okay.

93
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,060
<5-11,Supervisor>无论他们如何作答
<5-11,Supervisor>Whatever they say,

94
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:05,390
<5-11,Supervisor>你都可以在脚本中找到相应回答
<5-11,Supervisor>you can find the answer to it, here in the script.

95
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,970
<5-13,Supervisor>我想你准备好了
<5-13,Supervisor>So I think you're ready to sell toner.

96
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:10,220
<5-13,Supervisor>-还有问题吗  -没有
<5-13,Supervisor>- Do you have any last questions? - No.

97

98
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,070
<5-14,Phoebe>墨盒是什么
<5-14,Phoebe>What is toner?

99
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,180
<5-14,Phoebe>乔伊

102
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,450
<6-1,Chandler>啤酒还是冰的
<6-1,Chandler>Beer's still cold.

103
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:37,290
<6-1,Chandler>这里一定发生了很可怕的事
<6-1,Chandler>Something terrible must have happened here.

104
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:48,650
<6-1,Chandler>不不不
<6-1,Chandler>Oh, no, no, no!

105
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:52,940
<6-1,Chandler>史迪威  我没来过这里
<6-1,Chandler>Stevie, I was never here.

106
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:59,370
<7-2,Mr. Geller>-爸  -我在这里
<7-2,Mr. Geller>- Dad? - I'm here!

108
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:04,090
<7-4,Mr. Geller>你们来看我工作
<7-4,Mr. Geller>Seems like just yesterday

109
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:06,510
<7-4,Mr. Geller>感觉还像昨天
<7-4,Mr. Geller>you guys used to come out to watch me work.

110
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,120
<7-5,Ross>我们不敢相信你们要卖掉房子
<7-5,Ross>We can't believe you're selling the house.

111
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,480
<7-6,Mr. Geller>是时候让新家庭在这里开始了
<7-6,Mr. Geller>Time for a new family to start here.

112
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,830
<7-6,Mr. Geller>我希望在支票兑现前他们不会发现
<7-6,Mr. Geller>I hope their check clears before they find the crack...

113
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:18,080
<7-6,Mr. Geller>地基有裂痕  天花板的石棉瓦破了
<7-6,Mr. Geller>...in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling.

114
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:22,290
<7-7,Ross>我们快把东西拿一拿  离开这里吧
<7-7,Ross>Let's grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.

115
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,650
<7-8,Mr. Geller>抱歉不能继续保留你们孩提时代的玩具了
<7-8,Mr. Geller>Sorry we can't store your things.

116
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:26,710
<7-8,Mr. Geller>没事
<7-8,Mr. Geller>Oh, it's okay.

117
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:29,060
<7-9,Monica>我迫不及待想要再看看那些东西
<7-9,Monica>I can't wait to see everything again.

118
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,760
<7-10,Mr. Geller>我不知道那些盒子里都存了些什么
<7-10,Mr. Geller>I don't know what's those boxes down here.

119
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:35,550
<7-10,Mr. Geller>但我知道阁楼上有六七箱简易烘焙烤箱
<7-10,Mr. Geller>But I do know there are six or seven Easy-Bake Ovens in the attic.

120
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,870
<7-11,Monica>我以前最喜欢玩开餐厅的游戏了
<7-11,Monica>I used to love to play restaurant.

121
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:41,600
<7-12,Ross>但你最爱的还是"吃面粉糊"游戏
<7-12,Ross>Not as much as you loved to play "Uncooked batter eater."

122
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:44,610
<7-13,Monica>你不能要求
<7-13,Monica>You can't expect a child

123
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:47,720
<7-13,Monica>小孩子等着电灯泡把巧克力蛋糕烤熟
<7-13,Monica>to wait for a light bulb to cook brownies.

124
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:51,250
<7-14,Mr. Geller>我想你的箱子应该都在这里
<7-14,Mr. Geller>So I think your boxes are over here.

125
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,010
<7-14,Mr. Geller>太棒了
<7-14,Mr. Geller>Oh, great.

126
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:54,570
<7-15,Ross>嘿
<7-15,Ross>Hey...

127
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,370
<7-15,Ross>这是谁的烟
<7-15,Ross>...whose cigarettes are these?

128
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:00,590
<7-15,Ross>我不知道
<7-15,Ross>I don't know.

129
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:03,890
<7-16,Mr. Geller>一定是你妈的
<7-16,Mr. Geller>They must be your mother's.

155
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:42,010
<9-2,Phoebe>但是以我们的价格来说  人人都需要墨盒
<9-2,Phoebe>but at our prices, everyone needs toner.

156
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:44,080
<9-3,Earl>我不要

163
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,780

164
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:16,620
<9-8,Phoebe>就因为你们没墨盒了吗
<9-8,Phoebe>Is that because you're out of toner?

169
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:41,750
<10-3,Earl>我猜我能把它延期一下吧

182
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:23,050
<10-9,Earl>都没有人抬头来看我一眼  等一下
<10-9,Earl>...and no one's even looked up from their desk. Hang on.

183
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,260
<10-9,Earl>大伙们
<10-9,Earl>Hey, everybody...

184
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,890

185
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,830
<10-9,Earl>没人理我
<10-9,Earl>I got nothing.

186
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:37,820
<10-9,Earl>好样的  椅子
<10-9,Earl>Good chair.

187

<11-1,Chandler>如果有人问起
<11-1,Chandler>Now, if anybody asks...

188
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:42,620
<11-1,Chandler>你就叫罗西塔
<11-1,Chandler>...your name is Rosita.

189
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:09,100
<11-4,Rachel>真可怜  英年早逝
<11-4,Rachel>Poor thing. Cut down in her prime.

191
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:16,150
<11-11,Rachel>也许你该把罗西塔移出去
<11-11,Rachel>Maybe we should move Rosita out of here.

192
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:18,610
<11-11,Rachel>开始疗伤过程
<11-11,Rachel>Start the healing process.

00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:44,680
<11-13,Rachel>她痊愈了
<11-13,Rachel>She's healed!

195
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:51,310
<11-14,Joey>-那太奇怪  -一点都不奇怪
<11-14,Joey>- That's weird. - No, it's not weird.

196
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,160
<11-14,Joey>这是奇迹
<11-14,Joey>It's a miracle!

197
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:57,630
<11-15,Rachel>这不是奇迹  一定有合理的解释
<11-15,Rachel>It's not a miracle. I'm sure there's an explanation.

198
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:02,410
<11-16,Joey>只要你的心地纯良  奇迹一定会发生
<11-16,Joey>There is. If your heart is pure, wondrous things can happen.

199
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:07,380
<12-1,Mr. Geller>她会了解的  我不是故意的
<12-1,Mr. Geller>She'll understand. I didn't do it on purpose.

200
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,130
<12-2,Ross>爸  那不是重点
<12-2,Ross>Dad, that won't matter to her.

<12-2,Ross>你看  我的箱子完全没事

203
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:16,270
<12-2,Ross>长出新的东西了
<12-2,Ross>...growing new stuff.

204
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:18,600
<12-2,Ross>就是这样的事
<12-2,Ross>This is the kind of thing...

205
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,480
<12-2,Ross>让她认为你们爱我更胜于爱她
<12-2,Ross>...that makes her think you love me more than her.

206
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,700
<12-3,Mr. Geller>天啊  她真的那么认为
<12-3,Mr. Geller>My God. Does she think that?

<12-4,Ross>-你能怪她吗  -我不知道
<12-4,Ross>- Can you blame her? - I don't know.

208
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:29,120
<12-5,Mr. Geller>或许我们在潜意识上是偏爱你的
<12-5,Mr. Geller>We may have favored you unconsciously.

209
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,440
<12-5,Mr. Geller>你是个医学奇迹
<12-5,Mr. Geller>You were a medical marvel.

<12-5,Mr. Geller>医生都说你母亲无法
<12-5,Mr. Geller>The doctors said your mom couldn't...

211
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:33,500
<12-6,Ross>我不想听
<12-6,Ross>I don't want to hear it.

212
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,300
<12-8,Ross>-真的吗  -现在不想听
<12-8,Ross>- Really? - Well, not right now.

<12-8,Ross>只要能和她扯上关系的  就放在这些箱子里
<12-8,Ross>...and whatever we can pass off as hers, we'll put in there.

218
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,280
<12-10,Ross>-类似这个  她有可能会做这个  -对
<12-10,Ross>- Like, this. She could have made this - Sure.

<13-7,Rachel>You can hook it to the TV and you get radio.

225
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,020
<13-8,Joey>我的椅子能自愈
<13-8,Joey>My chair heals itself.

00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,220
<15-14,Monica>噢  这是你的
<15-14,Monica>Oh, this is yours.

249
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,780
<15-15,Ross>我不知道它怎么会跑到那里去
<15-15,Ross>I don't know how that got in there.

250
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:48,930
<15-16,Monica>这些不是我的东西
<15-16,Monica>Hey, this isn't my stuff.

251
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:52,410
<15-16,Monica>罗斯  这些是你的箱子
<15-16,Monica>Ross, these are your boxes.

252
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:57,750
<15-16,Monica>我的箱子在哪里
<15-16,Monica>Where are my boxes?

253
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:03,790
<15-18,Monica>车库淹水甜心  你的箱子都进了水  对不起
<15-18,Monica>The garage flooded, sweetie, and ruined your boxes. I'm sorry.

254
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:05,370
<15-20,Mr. Geller>只有我的淹了
<15-20,Mr. Geller>Just mine?

255
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,140
<15-22,Mr. Geller>恐怕是这样
<15-22,Mr. Geller>I'm afraid so.

256
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,640
<15-23,Monica>为什么罗斯的东西都没坏
<15-23,Monica>Why wasn't Ross' stuff ruined?

257
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:15,290
<15-24,Mr. Geller>我用你的箱子挡水  保护我的保时捷
<15-24,Mr. Geller>I used your boxes to divert water away from the Porsche.

258
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:18,250
<15-25,Monica>罗斯的东西都没事  但我的回忆都没有了
<15-25,Monica>Ross' stuff is fine, but I have no memories...

259
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,230
<15-25,Monica>只因为你不希望自己车的底盘不碰到水
<15-25,Monica>...so you could keep the bottom of your car from water?

260
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:24,450
<15-26,Mr. Geller>水里有树叶  泥巴跟杂物
<15-26,Mr. Geller>There was also leaves and gook and stuff.

261
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,070
<15-27,Monica>我不敢相信
<15-27,Monica>I can't believe this!

262
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,390
<15-28,Mr. Geller>去他的  我要抽根烟
<15-28,Mr. Geller>Screw it. I'm having one.

263
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,840
<16-1,Rachel>-嘿  钱德勒  -嘿
<16-1,Rachel>- Hey, Chandler. - Hey.

264
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:47,690
<16-3,Rachel>你要不要试试看一张可以平躺
<16-3,Rachel>How'd you like to sit in a chair that reclines...

265
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:50,010
<16-3,Rachel>有滚轮按摩功能
<16-3,Rachel>...has a rolling massage...

266
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:52,480
<16-3,Rachel>头枕上还有喇叭的椅子
<16-3,Rachel>...and speakers in the headrest?

267
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,910
<16-4,Chandler>我试过很多次
<16-4,Chandler>I've tried that so many times...

268
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:57,730
<16-4,Chandler>但他们已经不再让我走进他们店里
<16-4,Chandler>...they won't even let me in the store anymore.

269
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,820
<16-5,Rachel>如果我说你可以到我家试坐一下呢
<16-5,Rachel>What if I said you could do it in my apartment?

270
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,200
<16-6,Chandler>你是在告诉我
<16-6,Chandler>Are you telling me...

271
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,810
<16-6,Chandler>你买了那张让其他椅子都变成废物的椅子
<16-6,Chandler>...you bought the chair that makes all others obsolete?

272
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:12,720
<16-6,Chandler>那张《座椅杂志》称其为年度座椅的椅子
<16-6,Chandler>The chair that Sit Magazine called "Chair of the Year"?

273
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,700
<16-7,Rachel>我刚刚买了
<16-7,Rachel>I just purchased...

274
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:19,820
<16-7,Rachel>懒人E倾斜3000型
<16-7,Rachel>...the La-Z-Boy E-Cliner 3000.

275
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,440
<16-8,Chandler>那真的是太棒了  你为什么买下它
<16-8,Chandler>Well, that's awesome! That's great! What made you do it?

276
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,490
<16-9,Rachel>说来话长  但我弄坏了乔伊的椅子
<16-9,Rachel>It's a long story, but, I broke Joey's chair...

277
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:28,530
<16-10,Chandler>是你弄坏了乔伊的椅子
<16-10,Chandler>Whoa, whoa, whoa. You broke Joey's chair?

278
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:32,680
<16-12,Chandler>我以为是我干的  所以我用我的椅子调了包
<16-12,Chandler>I thought I did, that's why I replaced it with mine.

279
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:36,340
<16-13,Rachel>它是这么被修好的
<16-13,Rachel>That's how it got fixed!

280
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,800
<16-14,Chandler>你以为是妖精把它修好的
<16-14,Chandler>You thought that elves came in and fixed it?

281
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,380
<16-14,Chandler>不是
<16-14,Chandler>No.

282
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,370
<16-15,Rachel>是天使干的
<16-15,Rachel>Angels.

283
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:46,530
<16-16,Chandler>我要把我的椅子拿回来
<16-16,Chandler>I'm getting my chair back.

284
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:52,700
<16-18,Joey>看起来这椅子没自愈成功啊
<16-18,Joey>Well, looks like it wasn't healed after all!

285
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:57,300
<16-18,Joey>这椅子是我的了
<16-18,Joey>I guess this chair's mine now.

286
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,830
<16-19,Chandler>乔伊  你弄坏了我的椅子
<16-19,Chandler>Joey, you broke my chair!

287
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:02,660
<16-20,Joey>你的
<16-20,Joey>Your chair?

288
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:06,260
<16-21,Rachel>他以为他把它弄坏了  所以他掉了包
<16-21,Rachel>He thought he broke it, so he switched chairs.

289
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,140
<16-22,Joey>奇迹根本不存在
<16-22,Joey>So there was no miracle?

290
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:10,430
<16-23,Rachel>没错  乔伊  奇迹不存在
<16-23,Rachel>No, Joe. No miracle.

291
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,890
<16-24,Joey>这真的是太糟糕了
<16-24,Joey>Oh, no! This is devastating!

292
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,100
<16-24,Joey>我的信念被击垮了
<16-24,Joey>My faith is shaken.

293
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,740
<16-24,Joey>我很高兴这张新椅子能陪我走过这一切
<16-24,Joey>I'm glad I have a new chair to get me through this.

294
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:25,480
<17-1,Phoebe>我在哪能找到厄尔  总务部经理
<17-1,Phoebe>Where can I find Earl? He's the supply manager here.

295
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,240
<17-2,Marge>我不认识厄尔
<17-2,Marge>I don't know any Earl.

296
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,350
<17-3,Earl>我在这
<17-3,Earl>I'm right here!

297
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:34,400
<17-4,Phoebe>厄尔
<17-4,Phoebe>Earl?

298
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:37,420
<17-4,Phoebe>我是菲比
<17-4,Phoebe>I'm Phoebe.

299
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,930
<17-4,Phoebe>菲比
<17-4,Phoebe>Phoebe?

300
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:41,530
<17-5,Earl>卖墨盒的小姐
<17-5,Earl>The lady who sells toner?

301
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:44,860
<17-6,Phoebe>听着  你不能自杀
<17-6,Phoebe>Look, you can't kill yourself.

302
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:47,810
<17-7,Earl>我很感激你赶过来
<17-7,Earl>Look, I really appreciate you coming down...

303
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:49,960
<17-8,Phoebe>我不能让你那么做
<17-8,Phoebe>No, I can't let you do it.

304
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:54,280
<17-10,Phoebe>-为什么  -因为命运让我今天给你打了电话
<17-10,Phoebe>- Why? - Because, fate made me call you today.

305
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,140
<17-11,Earl>我以为你是为了墨盒
<17-11,Earl>I thought it was toner.

306
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:01,370
<17-12,Phoebe>好好想一想  好吗  这根本不是我的正职
<17-12,Phoebe>Think about it, okay? This isn't even my regular job.

307
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:04,730
<17-12,Phoebe>我第一天上班第一个电话  就是打给你
<17-12,Phoebe>My first day, you're my first call.

308
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:08,000
<17-12,Phoebe>其他人可能会挂掉电话  但我不会那么做
<17-12,Phoebe>Somebody else may have hung up, but I wouldn't do that...

309
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,610
<17-12,Phoebe>因为我了解这种事
<17-12,Phoebe>...because I know about this stuff.

310
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:13,590
<17-12,Phoebe>-我妈是自杀的  -真的吗
<17-12,Phoebe>- My mom killed herself. - Really?

311
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:14,730
<17-15,Earl>怎么自杀的
<17-15,Earl>How?

312
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:16,850
<17-16,Phoebe>我不会给你自杀温馨小贴士的
<17-16,Phoebe>I'm not gonna give you tips.

313
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:20,430
<17-16,Phoebe>你看不出来
<17-16,Phoebe>Don't you see that this...

314
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:24,820
<17-16,Phoebe>这些都是注定的  所以我才会来阻止你自杀
<17-16,Phoebe>...all came together so I could stop you from doing this?

315
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,600
<17-17,Earl>-这不是巧合吗  -这是命中注定
<17-17,Earl>- Couldrt it just be a coincidence? - No, it's fate.

316
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:32,950
<17-18,Phoebe>它看起来不像是命中注定
<17-18,Phoebe>It doesn't really seem like enough to be fate.

317
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:33,950
<17-19,Earl>好吧
<17-19,Earl>Oh, well.

318
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:36,610
<17-20,Phoebe>有件事很奇怪
<17-20,Phoebe>Okay, here's a weird thing.

319
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:40,710
<17-20,Phoebe>我妈妈也是总务部经理
<17-20,Phoebe>My mother was also a supply manager.

320
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,980
<17-21,Earl>事实上我是办公室经理
<17-21,Earl>I'm actually the office manager.

321
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,430
<17-21,Earl>我的天啊  她也是
<17-21,Earl>Oh, my God! So was she!

322
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:48,920
<17-22,Phoebe>还有这个
<17-22,Phoebe>And get this, okay.

323
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:52,900
<17-22,Phoebe>你叫厄尔  对吧  她叫做普厄儿
<17-22,Phoebe>Your name is Earl, right? Her name was Pearl.

324
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,920
<17-22,Phoebe>普厄尔
<17-22,Phoebe>Puh-Earl.

325
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,060
<17-23,Earl>还有别的证据吗
<17-23,Earl>Was there anything else?

326
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,530
<17-23,Earl>当然
<17-23,Earl>Sure.

327
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:03,080
<17-24,Phoebe>你是哪里人
<17-24,Phoebe>Where're you from?

328
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:06,260
<17-26,Phoebe>-费城  -我的天啊  她也是
<17-26,Phoebe>- Philadelphia. - Oh, my God, so was she!

329
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:10,190
<17-26,Phoebe>我都起鸡皮疙瘩了
<17-26,Phoebe>I've got goose bumps.

330
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:13,610
<17-28,Phoebe>-是吗  -我穿太多  这里太热
<17-28,Phoebe>- Really? - I'm wearing layers, and it's warm.

331
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:17,500
<17-30,Phoebe>或许这些混蛋不在乎你
<17-30,Phoebe>These jerks might not care about you...

332
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:21,660
<17-30,Phoebe>但宇宙在乎你  那才是最重要的
<17-30,Phoebe>...but the universe does, and that says a lot.

333
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,250
<17-30,Phoebe>你们听到了吗
<17-30,Phoebe>Did you hear that?

334
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:28,240
<17-31,Earl>我不需要你们在乎我
<17-31,Earl>I don't need you guys to care about me...

335
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,630
<17-31,Earl>因为宇宙在乎我
<17-31,Earl>...because the universe cares!

336
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:32,900
<17-31,Earl>整个宇宙在乎我
<17-31,Earl>The whole universe!

337
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:41,090
<17-31,Earl>我真的希望他们能在乎我一下
<17-31,Earl>I really wish they'd care a little bit.

338
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:45,230
<17-31,Earl>这真的是太可怕了
<17-31,Earl>Oh, this is terrible.

339
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:47,780
<18-1,Monica>所有的东西都毁了
<18-1,Monica>Everything is destroyed.

340
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,900
<18-1,Monica>看这个
<18-1,Monica>Look at this.

341
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,580
<18-1,Monica>对我意义重大我才收起来
<18-1,Monica>It meant enough for me to save,

342
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:54,140
<18-1,Monica>但现在我不知道这是什么了
<18-1,Monica>and now I can't tell what it is.

343
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,460
<18-1,Monica>还是很柔软
<18-1,Monica>It's still soft.

344
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,980
<18-1,Monica>你觉得它是什么呢
<18-1,Monica>What do you think this is?

345
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:06,220
<18-2,Ross>老鼠吧
<18-2,Ross>I think it was a mouse.

346
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:16,510
<18-3,Mr. Geller>-你还好吗 甜心  -你觉得呢
<18-3,Mr. Geller>- How are you, honey? - How do you think I am?

347
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:19,290
<18-4,Monica>你毁了我的儿时记忆
<18-4,Monica>You've wrecked my childhood memories...

348
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:21,350
<18-4,Monica>你们只爱罗斯
<18-4,Monica>...you love Ross more than me.

349
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:24,300
<18-4,Monica>我刚刚还拿死老鼠摩挲了我的脸
<18-4,Monica>And I just rubbed a dead mouse on my face.

350
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:30,690
<18-5,Mr. Geller>甜心  我们爱你和爱罗斯一样多
<18-5,Mr. Geller>Sweetheart, we love you just as much as Ross.

351
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:32,900
<18-5,Mr. Geller>箱子的事我很抱歉
<18-5,Mr. Geller>I'm sorry about everything that happened...

352
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,410
<18-5,Mr. Geller>也许我永远没办法补偿你
<18-5,Mr. Geller>...and I probably can't make it up to you...

353
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:38,650
<18-5,Mr. Geller>但这是个开始
<18-5,Mr. Geller>...but here's a start.

354
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,750
<18-7,Mr. Geller>-这是什么  -我保时捷的钥匙
<18-7,Mr. Geller>- What's this? - It's the key to my Porsche.

355
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:47,640
<18-7,Mr. Geller>你保时捷的钥匙
<18-7,Mr. Geller>Well, the key to your Porsche.

356
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:49,420
<18-8,Monica>什么
<18-8,Monica>What?

357
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,030
<18-9,Ross>什么
<18-9,Ross>What?!

358
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:54,980
<18-10,Mr. Geller>我一直想把它处理掉  那天我开着它在外面
<18-10,Mr. Geller>I've been thinking getting rid of it. I was driving it the other day.

359
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:57,540
<18-10,Mr. Geller>我在后视镜里看到自己的倒影
<18-10,Mr. Geller>I saw my reflection on the window.

360
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:01,090
<18-10,Mr. Geller>你妈说的对  我看起来像个混球
