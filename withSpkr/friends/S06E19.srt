<1-4,Rachel>-我们现在的确是室友  -没错
<1-4,Rachel>- l guess we are roommates now. - l know.

7
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:29,060
<1-5,Joey>既然你都这么说了  我们的冰箱坏了
<1-5,Joey>Yeah! Well, now that you bring it up. Our fridge is broken,

8
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,110
<1-5,Joey>得买台新的
<1-5,Joey>we have to get a new one.

9
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:33,910
<1-5,Joey>我算了算你该付一半  谢谢400块
<1-5,Joey>Now, I checked around and your half is $400. Thanks a lot.

10
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:37,380
<1-6,Rachel>我才不帮你摊一半呢
<1-6,Rachel>l'm not paying for half of that.

11
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,110
<1-6,Rachel>我只住到我们家那边整理好而已
<1-6,Rachel>I'm only staying here until my apartment gets fixed.

12
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,500
<1-7,Joey>瑞秋  这台冰箱是我出生之后
<1-7,Joey>Look, Rach, my parents bought this fridge

13
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,950
<1-7,Joey>我父母买的  知道吗
<1-7,Joey>just after l was born. Okay?

14
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:47,830
<1-7,Joey>我用这么多年从没有过问题
<1-7,Joey>Now, l have never had a problem with it.

15
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:49,690
<1-7,Joey>你一来它就坏了
<1-7,Joey>Then you show up and it breaks!

16
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,760
<1-7,Joey>这意味着什么
<1-7,Joey>What does that tell you?

17
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:57,560
<1-8,Rachel>冰箱无法和人一样长寿
<1-8,Rachel>That refrigerators don’t live as long as people.

18
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:01,030
<1-9,Joey>你也知道自动提款机
<1-9,Joey>All right, now you know that

19
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:03,310
<1-9,Joey>一次只能提300块
<1-9,Joey>the ATM will only lets you take out 300 at a time.

20
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:06,340
<1-9,Joey>所以剩下的100块  你就用支票吧
<1-9,Joey>So I'll take a check for the other hundred.

21
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:08,050
<1-10,Rachel>你在开玩笑吧
<1-10,Rachel>You're joking, right?

22
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,550
<1-11,Joey>当然是在开玩笑啦  我不收支票
<1-11,Joey>Of course l'm joking. l don't take checks.

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,130
<2-8,Rachel>不是某种树  就是某种病...
<2-8,Rachel>Something, either trees or disease....

43
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:29,410
<2-8,Rachel>拉尔夫整天喃喃自语
<2-8,Rachel>Ralph mumbles a lot.

44
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,160
<2-9,Monica>他是不是都趁你不专心时  故意喃喃自语
<2-9,Monica>Does Ralph mumble when you're not paying attention?

45
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,440
<2-10,Rachel>对呀  好奇怪哦
