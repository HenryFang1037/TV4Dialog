<6-1,Phoebe>我们不会是在讨论
<6-1,Phoebe>We can't seriously be talking about

274
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:12,400
<6-5,Phoebe>爱丽丝不会支持的  是吗
<6-5,Phoebe>Alice would never go for it.Right?

275
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:14,400
<6-6,Frank Jr.>我不知道  她也太累了
<6-6,Frank Jr.>I don't know. She's pretty tired too.

276
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,610
<6-6,Frank Jr.>我想她可能会同意
<6-6,Frank Jr.>I think we could get her on board.

277
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:21,020
<6-7,Phoebe>为了不起争执
<6-7,Phoebe>Well, just for argument's sake, you know,

278
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:21,980
<6-7,Phoebe>假设说

00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:24,430
<6-7,Phoebe>你要放弃哪一个
<6-7,Phoebe>...which one would you be willing to give up?

00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,560
<6-10,Frank Jr.>他真的很幽默
<6-10,Frank Jr.>He's really funny.

283
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:37,420
<6-10,Frank Jr.>比如  那天他说了个笑话
<6-10,Frank Jr.>Like, the other day, he made up this joke:

284
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:39,210
<6-12,Frank Jr.>什么东西是绿的并且说
<6-12,Frank Jr.>What's green and says,

00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:44,160
<6-12,Frank Jr.>一只会说话的青蛙

<6-12,Frank Jr.>你不能带他走  他太有意思了
<6-12,Frank Jr.>Oh, no, you can't have him, he's too funny.

00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:53,270
<6-13,Phoebe>好吧  没关系  那莱丝莉呢
<6-13,Phoebe>Well, all right, that's fine. What about Leslie?

289
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,120
<6-14,Frank Jr.>不...  不要是莱丝莉
<6-14,Frank Jr.>Oh, no, no, not Leslie. No.

290
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,470
<6-14,Frank Jr.>她是唯一一个会
<6-14,Frank Jr.>She's the only one that knows

291
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,340
<6-14,Frank Jr.>打着嗝说出字母表来的
<6-14,Frank Jr.>how to burp the alphabet.

292
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,390
<6-15,Phoebe>好吧  那就只剩下钱德勒了
<6-15,Phoebe>All right, so that leaves Chandler.

293
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:03,820
<6-16,Frank Jr.>噢不...  你不能带走钱德
<6-16,Frank Jr.>No, no, you can't have Chandler.

294
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:06,300
<6-16,Frank Jr.>不...  她是个小天才
<6-16,Frank Jr.>No, no. She's my little genius.

295
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,880
<6-16,Frank Jr.>我对她抱有很大期望
<6-16,Frank Jr.>I got big hopes for her.

296
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:11,540
<6-16,Frank Jr.>她会成为医生或者房地产经纪人
<6-16,Frank Jr.>She's gonna be a doctor or a realtor.

297
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:17,700
<6-17,Phoebe>弗兰克  已经没孩子可选了
<6-17,Phoebe>Wow, Frank, I think we just ran out of kids.

298
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:21,170
<6-18,Frank Jr.>我想你是对的
<6-18,Frank Jr.>Oh, I think you're right.

299
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:25,310
<6-18,Frank Jr.>菲比
<6-18,Frank Jr.>Oh, wow. Phoebe,

300
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:28,770
<6-18,Frank Jr.>看来我不能放弃任何一个
<6-18,Frank Jr.>I don't think I can give one of them up.

301
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,190
<6-18,Frank Jr.>我是说  他们让我发疯
<6-18,Frank Jr.>I mean, you know, they drive me crazy,

302
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:32,460
<6-18,Frank Jr.>可他们是我的孩子
<6-18,Frank Jr.>but they're my babies.

00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,080
<6-18,Frank Jr.>很抱歉  弗兰克
<6-18,Frank Jr.>I'm sorry, Frank,

304
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,530
<6-19,Phoebe>我没想到事情会这样
<6-19,Phoebe>I didn't realize things were so bad.

305
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:40,440
<6-19,Phoebe>我会帮你的
<6-19,Phoebe>You know, I'll help out more.

00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:56,300
<6-23,Phoebe>你开玩笑吗

314
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,630
<6-23,Phoebe>你以为姐姐是干什么的

00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:19,790
<6-25,Monica>他们在厨房弄点吃的
<6-25,Monica>They are in the kitchen, getting something to eat.

<6-25,Monica>真不敢相信他们有这么好
<6-25,Monica>Can you believe how nice they are?

321
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,760
<6-26,Chandler>我们必须马上走
<6-26,Chandler>We have to leave.

<6-27,Monica>为什么  你在洗手间做了什么
<6-27,Monica>Why? What did you do in the bathroom?

323
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,160
<6-28,Chandler>我还没去洗手间呢
<6-28,Chandler>I didn't get to the bathroom.

324
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:30,380
<6-28,Chandler>在路上碰到了欧文
<6-28,Chandler>I bumped into Owen on the way.

325
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,390
<6-28,Chandler>可他还不知道他是被领养的
<6-28,Chandler>He didn't know he was adopted.

326
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,230
<6-28,Chandler>有一丝丝的可能...
<6-28,Chandler>There's a slight chance...

327
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,770
<6-28,Chandler>我已经告诉了他
<6-28,Chandler>...l may have told him.

328
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,920
<6-29,Monica>天呐  我的手袋呢
<6-29,Monica>Oh, my God, where's my purse?

329
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,700
<6-29,Monica>不  我们把东西放在这儿
<6-29,Monica>No, I can replace everything in there.

330
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,420
<6-29,Monica>- 拿上活页册  走  -嗨
<6-29,Monica>- Get that binder and let's go!  - Hi.

00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,100
<6-31,Bill>给大家的一点小茶点
<6-31,Bill>Some little snacks for everybody.

332
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:47,200
<6-31,Bill>你们不用吃酸蠕虫  那是给欧文的
<6-31,Bill>You don't have to eat the sour worms. Those are for Owen.

333
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:49,190
<6-32,Colleen>我一会儿去叫他
<6-32,Colleen>I'll go get him in a second.

334
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,650
<6-32,Colleen>顺便说一句   你们该知道
<6-32,Colleen>By the way, you should know,

335
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,690
<6-32,Colleen>我们还没告诉他他是领养的
<6-32,Colleen>we haven't told him he's adopted yet.

336
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:55,230
<6-33,Chandler>可孩子们直觉很灵敏
<6-33,Chandler>But kids are so intuitive.

337
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,050
<6-33,Chandler>你不认为某种程度上他已经知道了
<6-33,Chandler>Don't you think, on some level, he already knows?

338
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:01,240
<6-35,Chandler>-我是领养的  -看  直觉
<6-35,Chandler>- I'm adopted?  - See? Intuitive.

339
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:04,010
<6-36,Bill>什么  你从哪儿听来的
<6-36,Bill>What? Where did you hear that?

340
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,460
<6-37,Owen>他告诉我的
<6-37,Owen>He told me.

341
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:10,280
<6-37,Owen>他还给我50块钱让我别说出来
<6-37,Owen>And he paid me 50 dollars not to tell.

342
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:13,710
<6-38,Chandler>那现在你该把钱还给我了
<6-38,Chandler>Which, technically, now you should give back.

343
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,800
<6-39,Colleen>你告诉他他是领养的
<6-39,Colleen>You told him he's adopted?

344
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:19,700
<6-39,Colleen>实在对不起
<6-39,Colleen>I'm sorry.

345
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,790
<6-40,Chandler>可你们应该在那儿或者什么地方写明白
<6-40,Chandler>But You should have a sign out there or something.

346
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:25,310
<6-40,Chandler>或者在人们进门的时候悄悄告诉他们
<6-40,Chandler>Or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door.

347
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,790
<6-40,Chandler>"欧文不知道他是领养的
<6-40,Chandler>"Owen doesn't know he's adopted,

348
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:28,870
<6-40,Chandler>他也认为圣诞老人是真实存在的"
<6-40,Chandler>and he also thinks Santa is real."

349
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:30,930
<6-41,Owen>他不存在
<6-41,Owen>He isn't?

350
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:34,430
<6-41,Owen>我们必须走了  亲爱的
<6-41,Owen>We have to get out of here, baby.

00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:00,060
<6-44,Ross>L代表"生活"
<6-44,Ross>L is for "life."

357
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:02,530
<6-44,Ross>没有爱情还叫什么生活
<6-44,Ross>And what is life without love?

358
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,830
<6-45,Rachel>我的天呐  我们要回答吗

<6-46,Ross>...very surprising turn of events...

363
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,740
<6-46,Ross>而顺便说明  我完全没意见

369
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,470
<6-46,Ross>有一天你们会结婚
<6-46,Ross>And that one day you might get married...

370
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,680
<6-46,Ross>还会有你们自己的孩子
<6-46,Ross>...and have children of your own.

371
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:04,050
<6-47,Joey>-伙计  你还好吧  -完全没问题
<6-47,Joey>- Dude, are you okay? - Totally.

372
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:07,680
<6-49,Rachel>罗斯  你看起来不太好
<6-49,Rachel>Ross, you don't seem okay.

373
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:08,640
<6-49,Rachel>对不起
<6-49,Rachel>I'm sorry,

374
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,000
<6-50,Charlie>一定是招待你们的压力太大了
<6-50,Charlie>it must be the pressure of entertaining.

375
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:18,070
<6-50,Charlie>我想如果我们吃点果馅饼会感觉好点
<6-50,Charlie>I think everyone would feel better if we had some flan.

376
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:22,460
<6-50,Charlie>等等  罗斯  我...我要走了
<6-50,Charlie>Wait, Ross. Ross, l--I have to take off.

377
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:24,310
<6-51,Ross>-不要  - 对不起
<6-51,Ross>- No!  - I'm sorry.

378
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,550
<6-52,Charlie>我明天早上还有一节很早的课
<6-52,Charlie>I have an early class in the morning.

379
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:30,330
<6-52,Charlie>不过今晚很美好
<6-52,Charlie>But this has been lovely.

380
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:35,680
<6-53,Ross>是吧  可你认为跟乔伊一起会尴尬
<6-53,Ross>Wasn't it? And you thought it would be awkward with Joey.

381
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:38,190
<6-53,Ross>而且你从没真正喜欢过瑞秋
<6-53,Ross>And that you never really liked Rachel.

382
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,730
<6-54,Charlie>你过火了
<6-54,Charlie>You are on fire!

383
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:43,710
<6-54,Charlie>我早上给你打电话  好吗
<6-54,Charlie>I'll call you in the morning, okay?

384
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,100
<6-56,Charlie>-好吧  -好
<6-56,Charlie>- Okay. - All right.

385
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:50,650
<6-57,Charlie>天呐  瑞秋  罗斯刚才说得简直太...
<6-57,Charlie>God, Rachel, what Ross just said, that's just--

386
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,900
<6-58,Rachel>没事  女孩们从来都不喜欢我
<6-58,Rachel>That's okay. Girls tend not to like me.

387
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,420
<6-64,Ross>好吧
<6-64,Ross>Fine.

388
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:01,780
<6-60,Ross>好吧  只上三人份果馅饼就好了
<6-60,Ross>Okay. I guess it's just flan for three.

389
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,230
<6-60,Ross>嘿  还挺押韵
<6-60,Ross>Hey, that rhymes.

390
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:11,400
<6-61,Rachel>罗斯  我想我们也该走了
<6-61,Rachel>You know what, Ross, I think we're gonna take off too.

391
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:16,220
<6-62,Ross>当然  天呐  我真蠢
<6-62,Ross>Of course. God, I'm so stupid.

392
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,980
<6-62,Ross>你们现在是一对了
<6-62,Ross>You guys are a couple now.

393
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:20,330
<6-62,Ross>我是说  你们可能想单独呆着
<6-62,Ross>I mean, you probably just want to be alone.

394
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:22,190
<6-63,Rachel>不... 我只是说天晚了
<6-63,Rachel>No, it's just getting late--

395
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:24,460
<6-64,Ross>没事的  真的没事
<6-64,Ross>It's fine. It's totally fine.

396
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:27,600
<6-64,Ross>我做了很多的马格丽塔  没事儿的
<6-64,Ross>I've got plenty of margaritas. It's all good.

397
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,920
<6-65,Ross>这又是什么好了
<6-65,Ross>I don't even know what that's for.

398
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:43,830
<6-65,Ross>知道吗
<6-65,Ross>You know what?

399
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:46,890
<6-66,Joey>我想我应该留下看他有没有事
<6-66,Joey>I think I'm gonna stay here and make sure he's okay.

400
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,960
<6-67,Rachel>这可能是个好主意
<6-67,Rachel>That's probably a good idea.

401
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:50,070
<6-68,Joey>明天早上见
<6-68,Joey>I'll see you in the morning.

402

404
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,110
<6-69,Rachel>我认为他永远不会
<6-69,Rachel>I don't think he's ever gonna

405
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:57,590
<6-69,Rachel>接受我们俩在一起
<6-69,Rachel>be okay with this.

406
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:59,770
<6-70,Joey>看起来不太好  是吗
<6-70,Joey>It doesn't look good, does it?
