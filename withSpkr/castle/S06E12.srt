3
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,180
<1-1,OPERATOR>911  有什么紧急情况
<1-1,OPERATOR>9-1-1. What's your emergency?

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,060
<1-1,OPERATOR>你好
<1-1,OPERATOR>Hello?

5
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:21,790
<1-2,OPERATOR>有人在吗
<1-2,OPERATOR>Is anybody there?

6
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:23,850
<1-2,OPERATOR>你需要帮助吗
<1-2,OPERATOR>Do you need assistance?

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,760
<1-2,OPERATOR>你有危险吗
<1-2,OPERATOR>Are you in danger?

8
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,890
<2-1,KATE BECKETT>卡塞尔  下雨怎么办
<2-1,KATE BECKETT>Castle, what if it rains?

9
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:32,250
<2-3,BECKETT>我们婚礼那天
<2-3,BECKETT>On our wedding day?

10
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:33,570
<2-4,CASTLE>下雨会带来好运
<2-4,CASTLE>That's supposed to be good luck.

11
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,380
<2-4,CASTLE>但以防万一  还是找个带室内厅的
<2-4,CASTLE>But we'll find a venue that has an indoor area,

12
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:37,120
<2-4,CASTLE>婚宴地点吧
<2-4,CASTLE>just in case.

13
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:38,300
<2-5,BECKETT>就算找到了完美的地方
<2-5,BECKETT>Even if we find the perfect place,

14
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:42,020
<2-5,BECKETT>-那也得等到十月以后  -十月
<2-5,BECKETT>- it's not gonna be available until at least October. - October!

15
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,020
<2-6,CASTLE>丰收的季节  完美
<2-6,CASTLE>Harvest season. Perfect.

16
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:47,410
<2-7,BECKETT>是完美  但那样我爸就不能陪我走向圣坛了
<2-7,BECKETT>Perfect, except if you want my dad to walk me down the aisle.

17
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:49,480
<2-7,BECKETT>他到时要去欧洲进行项目研究
<2-7,BECKETT>He's gonna be in Europe on the research project.

18
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,190
<2-8,CASTLE>好吧  那就来个冬季婚礼
<2-8,CASTLE>Oh. Fine. We'll have a winter wedding.

19
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:52,850
<2-9,BECKETT>不是说要在室外举行吗
<2-9,BECKETT>Didn't we say we wanted to do it outside?

20
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:55,950
<2-10,CASTLE>是啊  冻伤可不太喜庆
<2-10,CASTLE>Right. Yeah, frostbite isn't very festive.

21
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:58,850
<2-10,CASTLE>不如明年春天再结婚
<2-10,CASTLE>How about we get hitched, uh, spring of next year?

24
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,370
<2-11,BECKETT>要是我想早点结婚呢
<2-11,BECKETT>And what if I wanna get married sooner? Hmm?

25
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,800
<2-12,CASTLE>谁能怪你呢
<2-12,CASTLE>Who could blame you?

27
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:05,300
<2-13,MARTHA RODGERS>你俩真甜蜜
<2-13,MARTHA RODGERS>You two are so adorable.

28
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:06,950
<2-13,MARTHA RODGERS>我跟你说
<2-13,MARTHA RODGERS>Oh, you know what?

30
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:09,330
<2-14,BECKETT>也许我们可以今年夏天结婚
<2-14,BECKETT>Maybe we could find a venue for this summer.

31
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:10,930
<2-15,CASTLE>你要在纽约的盛夏
<2-15,CASTLE>You want to have a wedding

33
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:12,660
<2-15,CASTLE>举行婚礼
<2-15,CASTLE>in the middle of a new york summer?

34
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:14,730
<2-15,CASTLE>不要  你说得对
<2-15,CASTLE>No. You're right.

35
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:16,210
<2-16,BECKETT>我知道了  九月
<2-16,BECKETT>Oh! I know! September!

36
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,850
<2-16,BECKETT>不会太冷  不会太热
<2-16,BECKETT>It's not too hot. It's not too cold.

37
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:19,040
<2-16,BECKETT>温度适宜
<2-16,BECKETT>It's right in the goldilocks zone.

38
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,810
<2-17,CASTLE>-简直完美  -但我九月的周末
<2-17,CASTLE>- It's perfect. - It is, except I'll be out of town

39
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:22,430
<2-17,CASTLE>都要出城签售小说
<2-17,CASTLE>every weekend on my book signing tour.

40
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:23,990
<2-17,CASTLE>除非我们在周一结婚
<2-17,CASTLE>So unless we get married on a Monday,

41
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:25,440
<2-17,CASTLE>不然九月也不行
<2-17,CASTLE>September's gonna be tough.

42
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:28,120
<2-18,MARTHA>主动给你们点建议
<2-18,MARTHA>A little unsolicited advice.

43
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,410
<2-19,CASTLE>你哪条建议不是主动给出的
<2-19,CASTLE>Do you give another kind?

44
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:31,130
<2-20,MARTHA>生命中
<2-20,MARTHA>In life,

45
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,420
<2-20,MARTHA>做任何事都没有完美时机这一说
<2-20,MARTHA>there is no such thing as a perfect time for anything.

46
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:38,460
<2-21,CASTLE>不好意思  这算什么建议
<2-21,CASTLE>I'm sorry, that's advice how?

47
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,030
<2-21,CASTLE>别等了
<2-21,CASTLE>Don't wait!

48
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:42,260
<2-22,MARTHA>管他呢  现在就去市政厅
<2-22,MARTHA>Hell, just go down to city hall right now.

49
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:44,540
<2-22,MARTHA>你俩彼此相爱  别再光说了
<2-22,MARTHA>You love each other. Stop talking about it.

50
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:45,560
<2-22,MARTHA>行动起来吧
<2-22,MARTHA>Just do it.

51
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:50,680
<2-23,BECKETT>我们会找到一个好日子的  没关系
<2-23,BECKETT>We'll find a date. It's gonna be fine.

52
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:51,790
<2-24,CASTLE>对啊  还是继续找吧
<2-24,CASTLE>Let's keep-- yeah, looking. Okay.

54
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,050
<3-1,BECKETT>我不知道  卡塞尔  也许我们要求太高了
<3-1,BECKETT>I don't know, Castle. Maybe we're being too ambitious.

55
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,380
<3-1,BECKETT>也许我们是该考虑明年春天
<3-1,BECKETT>Maybe we should consider the spring of next year.

56
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,530
<3-2,CASTLE>你不是不想等这么久吗
<3-2,CASTLE>I thought you didn't wanna wait that long.

57
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:02,500
<3-3,BECKETT>我就想随机应变[柔韧]
<3-3,BECKETT>Nah, I just-- I wanna be flexible.

58
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,680
<3-4,CASTLE>你已经是了
<3-4,CASTLE>You already are flexible.

59
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:06,500
<3-4,CASTLE>看到我的双关了没
<3-4,CASTLE>You see what I... did there.

60
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,050
<3-5,JAVIER ESPOSITO>什么这么好笑
<3-5,JAVIER ESPOSITO>What's so funny?

61
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:09,620
<3-6,CASTLE>你知道贝克特能把她的...
<3-6,CASTLE>Well, actually, did you know Beckett can lift her--

62
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,830
<3-7,BECKETT>-没什么  别说了  -晚点告诉你
<3-7,BECKETT>- No, nothing. Hello. Nothing. - I'll tell you later.

63
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:12,960
<3-8,CASTLE>-不许说  -不说
<3-8,CASTLE>- No. - No.

64
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,610
<3-10,CASTLE>死者叫泰德·罗林斯
<3-10,CASTLE>Well, our victim is a Ted Rollins.

65
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:16,030
<3-11,ESPOSITO>胸口中了两枪
<3-11,ESPOSITO>He was shot twice in the chest.

66
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,740
<3-11,ESPOSITO>今年20岁  一个人住
<3-11,ESPOSITO>He was 20 years old, lived alone,

67
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:21,120
<3-11,ESPOSITO>在二手音像店兼职
<3-11,ESPOSITO>and worked part-time at a secondhand record store.

68
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:24,360
<3-12,BECKETT>一个卖二手唱片为生的20岁小伙子怎么负担得起
<3-12,BECKETT>So how's a 20-year-old who sells used records for a living

69
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,990
<3-12,BECKETT>这样的公寓
<3-12,BECKETT>own a place like this?

70
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:27,980
<3-13,ESPOSITO>说不通的可不止这一点
<3-13,ESPOSITO>This is one of the many things that don't add up here.

71
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,150
<3-14,CASTLE>比如他为什么浑身湿透了
<3-14,CASTLE>Like why he's soaking wet?

72
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,870
<3-15,LANIE PARISH>凶手把泰德·罗林斯的尸体放在浴缸里
<3-15,LANIE PARISH>The killer left Ted Rollins' body in the shower.

73
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:34,290
<3-15,LANIE PARISH>警官到达时  水还是开着的
<3-15,LANIE PARISH>When the officers arrived, the water was still going.

74
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:35,340
<3-16,BECKETT>那是谁报的警
<3-16,BECKETT>And who called them in?

75
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,460
<3-17,ESPOSITO>好问题
<3-17,ESPOSITO>That's a good question.

76
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:39,730
<3-17,ESPOSITO>11点50分  制服警员因一通死者手机拨出的
<3-17,ESPOSITO>At 11:50, uniforms responded to a 9-1-1 call

77
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:41,400
<3-17,ESPOSITO>报警电话而出警
<3-17,ESPOSITO>made from the victim's cell phone.

78
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,350
<3-18,LANIE>但死亡时间是8点到11点
<3-18,LANIE>But the time of death is between 8:00 and 11:00.

79
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:45,620
<3-18,LANIE>所以不可能是泰德报的警
<3-18,LANIE>So there's no way Ted could've placed that call.

80
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:49,200
<3-19,CASTLE>凶手射杀了他又报了警
<3-19,CASTLE>So the killer shot him and then called 9-1-1.

81
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:51,930
<3-20,LANIE>但死者不是在公寓里中枪的
<3-20,LANIE>Except our victim was not shot in this apartment.

82
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:52,870
<3-21,BECKETT>为什么这么说
<3-21,BECKETT>How do we know that?

83
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,700
<3-22,LANIE>因为他背上有子弹射出口
<3-22,LANIE>Because he has exit wounds in his back,

84
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,280
<3-22,LANIE>但浴室乃至整个公寓里
<3-22,LANIE>but there are no bullets in the bathroom

85
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,180
<3-22,LANIE>都没有子弹
<3-22,LANIE>or anywhere else in the apartment.

86
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,340
<3-22,LANIE>尸斑也显示尸体被人移动过
<3-22,LANIE>Plus lividity indicates the body was moved.

87
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,830
<3-23,BECKETT>凶手把他放在浴缸里冲澡
<3-23,BECKETT>Okay, so then the killer put him in the shower

88
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:04,270
<3-23,BECKETT>好把原始犯罪现场的蛛丝马迹冲刷掉
<3-23,BECKETT>to wash off the trace evidence from the original crime scene.

89
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:06,740
<3-24,LANIE>差点就成功了  但功亏一篑
<3-24,LANIE>And it almost worked except for this.

90
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,690
<3-24,LANIE>这里带红点的油脂
<3-24,LANIE>The grease here with the tiny red specks?

91
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:10,130
<3-24,LANIE>没被水冲掉
<3-24,LANIE>Water didn't get that out.

92
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:12,520
<3-24,LANIE>膝盖和手肘都有
<3-24,LANIE>It's on his knees and his elbows.

93
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,730
<3-24,LANIE>我猜想是他
<3-24,LANIE>I'm thinking he fell

94
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:16,020
<3-24,LANIE>中枪时摔在了这东西上
<3-24,LANIE>when he got shot and landed in that stuff.

95
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,140
<3-25,BECKETT>把这东西送到鉴证科去
<3-25,BECKETT>Okay, let's get this material to C.S.U.

96
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,320
<3-25,BECKETT>-看他们能不能查到他在哪遇害的  -真不明白
<3-25,BECKETT>- see if they can tell us where he was killed. - I don't get it.

97
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,970
<3-26,ESPOSITO>凶手为什么要冒险把尸体从犯罪现场
<3-26,ESPOSITO>why would the killer risk moving the body back here

98
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:23,280
<3-26,ESPOSITO>搬到这里
<3-26,ESPOSITO>from the crime scene?

99
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:24,120
<3-27,CASTLE>这案子像
<3-27,CASTLE>Sounds like a case of

100
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:26,150
<3-27,CASTLE>讲述两名保险公司职员一心享受一个毕生难忘的劳动节假期
<3-27,CASTLE>但在假期中竟然经历了谋杀案  伤人罪及浪漫爱情等

101
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:26,150
<3-27,CASTLE>《老板渡假去》出了岔子
<3-27,CASTLE>"Weekend at bernie's" gone wrong.

102
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,920
<3-27,CASTLE>不  慢着
<3-27,CASTLE>No. No, wait.

103
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,220
<3-27,CASTLE>这么说的话就还有
<3-27,CASTLE>That would have to mean there's such a thing

104
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,230
<3-27,CASTLE>不出岔子的《老板渡假去》
<3-27,CASTLE>as a "Weekend at bernie's" gone right.

105
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:31,990
<3-27,CASTLE>等一下
<3-27,CASTLE>Wait a minute.

106
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:34,510
<3-28,BECKETT>两只脚的鞋带绑法不同
<3-28,BECKETT>These two shoelaces are tied differently.

107
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:36,420
<3-29,CASTLE>好奇怪
<3-29,CASTLE>That is odd.

108
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,550
<3-30,CASTLE>这更奇怪
<3-30,CASTLE>This is even more odd.

109
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:45,830
<3-31,BECKETT>你干什么
<3-31,BECKETT>What are you doing?

110
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:50,110
<3-32,CASTLE>看来泰德有个暗格
<3-32,CASTLE>Looks like Ted's got a secret compartment.

111
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,970
<3-32,CASTLE>没有秘密怎么称得上
<3-32,CASTLE>And what's a secret compartment...

112
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,510
<3-32,CASTLE>是暗格
<3-32,CASTLE>without a secret?

113
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:58,660
<3-32,CASTLE>手提电脑
<3-32,CASTLE>A laptop.

114
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:00,940
<3-32,CASTLE>疑团的关键以及凶手的身份
<3-32,CASTLE>The key to our mystery and the identity of our killer

115
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,990
<3-32,CASTLE>也许就在这机器里
<3-32,CASTLE>may lie within that device.

116
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,770
<4-1,TECH AGENT TORI>就算是  我也进不去
<4-1,TECH AGENT TORI>Well, if it does, I can't get to it.

117
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:08,070
<4-1,TECH AGENT TORI>说真的  我从没见过这种情况
<4-1,TECH AGENT TORI>Honestly, I've never seen anything like this before.

118
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:09,240
<4-2,BECKETT>这是什么
<4-2,BECKETT>So what are we looking at here?

119
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,430
<4-3,TORI>一个很高级的加密程序
<4-3,TORI>A very high-level encryption program.

120
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,890
<4-3,TORI>怎么  你不能破解吗
<4-3,TORI>What, and you can't crack it?

121
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:15,000
<4-4,ESPOSITO>拜托  天才少女  我以为你是最棒的
<4-4,ESPOSITO>Come on, genius bar. I thought you were the best.

122
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,670
<4-4,ESPOSITO>我是
<4-4,ESPOSITO>I am.

123
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:19,150
<4-5,TORI>只是设计这东西的人...更棒
<4-5,TORI>It's just whoever designed this is... better.

124
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:21,350
<4-5,TORI>给我点时间  让我想想办法
<4-5,TORI>But give me some time. Let me see what I can do.

125
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:23,100
<4-7,CASTLE>还有人好奇一个唱片店店员
<4-7,CASTLE>Anyone else wondering what a record store clerk

126
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,150
<4-7,CASTLE>怎么会有这种高科技的东西吗
<4-7,CASTLE>is doing with this kind of technology?

127
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,830
<4-8,BECKETT>埃斯波  你跟他的家人联系了吗
<4-8,BECKETT>Espo, did you contact next of kin?

128
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,800
<4-9,ESPOSITO>联系了  泰德的父亲和他的弟弟
<4-9,ESPOSITO>Yeah, Ted's father and little brother.

129
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,920
<4-9,ESPOSITO>他们正赶过来
<4-9,ESPOSITO>They're on their way down.

130
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,590
<4-9,ESPOSITO>我昨天还和泰德聊过  他怎么会死
<4-9,ESPOSITO>I just talked to Ted yesterday. How could he be gone?

131
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,900
<5-1,BECKETT>罗林斯先生  你昨天跟你儿子聊的时候
<5-1,BECKETT>Mr. Rollins, when you spoke with your son,

132
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,290
<5-1,BECKETT>他有没有表现出担忧或害怕
<5-1,BECKETT>did he seem worried or scared about anything?

133
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:40,680
<5-1,BECKETT>他说一切都很好
<5-1,BECKETT>He said everything was fine.

134
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:42,720
<5-2,ESPOSITO>也许你能帮我们点别的忙
<5-2,ESPOSITO>Maybe you could help us with something else.

135
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:45,810
<5-2,ESPOSITO>我们在泰德住处的地板下找到一个笔记本电脑
<5-2,ESPOSITO>We found a laptop in one of the floorboards of Ted's place

136
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:48,300
<5-2,ESPOSITO>里面有一个很复杂的加密系统
<5-2,ESPOSITO>with a highly sophisticated encryption system.

137
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,670
<5-2,ESPOSITO>你们有人知道那是干什么用的吗
<5-2,ESPOSITO>Either one of you know what it was doing there?

138
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:53,940
<5-3,BECKETT>怎么了
<5-3,BECKETT>What is it?

139
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,580
<5-3,BECKETT>泰德是个...电脑高手
<5-3,BECKETT>Ted was a... computer whiz.

140
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:58,820
<5-4,GRANT>应该说是天才
<5-4,GRANT>More like a genius.

141
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,280
<5-4,GRANT>但那让他惹上了麻烦
<5-4,GRANT>But it got him into trouble.

142
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,220
<5-4,GRANT>泰德上高中时  他干上了身份盗窃
<5-4,GRANT>When Ted was in high school, he got into identity theft--

143
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:08,170
<5-5,GRANT>窃取信用卡  银行账户之类的东西
<5-5,GRANT>hijacking credit cards, bank accounts, stuff like that.

144
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:10,400
<5-5,GRANT>对  他称之为"效仿罗宾汉"
<5-5,GRANT>Yeah, he'd call it "Pulling a Robin Hood."

145
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:11,690
<5-5,GRANT>因为他从富人那里偷钱
<5-5,GRANT>'cause he would steal from the rich

146
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:12,800
<5-5,GRANT>然后送给穷人
<5-5,GRANT>and give to the poor.

147
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,940
<5-6,ESPOSITO>穷人是指泰德吗
<5-6,ESPOSITO>The poor being Ted?

148
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,120
<5-6,ESPOSITO>他那时只是个孩子
<5-6,ESPOSITO>He was just a kid.

149
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,380
<5-7,ESPOSITO>他总共偷了多少钱
<5-7,ESPOSITO>So how much did he end up stealing?

150
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,140
<5-7,ESPOSITO>140万美元
<5-7,ESPOSITO>$1.4 million.

151
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,760
<5-7,ESPOSITO>但法官让他还回去了
<5-7,ESPOSITO>But the judge made him give it back.

152
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,840
<5-8,ESPOSITO>泰德的认罪协议的一部分就是
<5-8,ESPOSITO>Part of Ted's plea deal was that he was barred

153
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,310
<5-8,ESPOSITO>他不能使用任何可以上网的设备
<5-8,ESPOSITO>from using any devices connecting him to the internet.

154
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:29,040
<5-9,BECKETT>所以他不应该有笔记本电脑
<5-9,BECKETT>So he shouldn't have had that laptop.

155
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:31,220
<5-9,BECKETT>有迹象表明他又重操旧业
<5-9,BECKETT>Is there anything to indicate that he went back

156
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,350
<5-9,BECKETT>开始进行身份盗窃了吗
<5-9,BECKETT>to committing identity theft?

157
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,600
<7-10,BECKETT>我下岗了  然后...
<7-10,BECKETT>I was laid off, and...

158
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,380
<7-11,TORI>泰德帮我付了格兰特的学费
<7-11,TORI>Ted helped me with Grant's tuition.

159
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,960
<7-12,BECKETT>我知道他在捣什么鬼
<7-12,BECKETT>I knew he was up to something.

160
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:45,350
<7-9,TORI>我只是不愿相信他又开始当黑客了
<7-9,TORI>I just didn't wanna believe he was hacking again.

161
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,720
<7-10,BECKETT>好吧
<7-10,BECKETT>Okay, so,

162
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,020
<6-1,ESPOSITO>我们假设他又开始盗窃身份了
<6-1,ESPOSITO>let's just say he went back to stealing identities.

163
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,850
<6-1,ESPOSITO>那能解释他被杀的原因吗
<6-1,ESPOSITO>Does that explain why he was killed?

164
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:56,500
<6-1,ESPOSITO>人们身份被窃后的确是会很生气
<6-1,ESPOSITO>Yeah, people get pissed about getting their identities stolen,

165
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,140
<6-1,ESPOSITO>但通常他们会报警
<6-1,ESPOSITO>but normally, they report it to the police.

166
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,460
<6-2,BECKETT>也许他偷了那些
<6-2,BECKETT>Well, maybe he stole from the kind of people

167
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,640
<6-2,BECKETT>不会报警的人
<6-2,BECKETT>that don't report to the police.

168
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:04,980
<6-3,BECKETT>看看是谁休陪产假回来了
<6-3,BECKETT>Look who's back from paternity leave.

169
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:06,140
<6-4,BECKETT>萨拉·格蕾丝怎么样
<6-4,BECKETT>So how's Sarah Grace?

170
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:09,570
<6-5,KEVIN RYAN>伙计  我跟你说  她真是...
<6-5,KEVIN RYAN>Oh! Man. I tell you, she is just...

171
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,330
<6-5,KEVIN RYAN>我的完美小天使
<6-5,KEVIN RYAN>my perfect little angel.

172
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:14,360
<6-6,BECKETT>她真可爱
<6-6,BECKETT>Oh, she's so cute.

173
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:19,070
<6-8,BECKETT>是我看错还是...她长得很像埃斯波西托
<6-8,BECKETT>Is it me or--or does she... look a lot like Esposito?

174
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,040
<6-9,ESPOSITO>对  没错
<6-9,ESPOSITO>Yeah, she does.

175
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,300
<6-11,RYAN>真的吗  贝克特
<6-11,RYAN>Really, Beckett?

176
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,010
<6-11,RYAN>我料到混蛋会说这种话而不是你
<6-11,RYAN>I expected that from jackass but not from you.

177
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:26,470
<6-11,RYAN>我把鉴证组的报告拿回来了
<6-11,RYAN>Anyway, so I got that C.S.U. report back.

178
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:29,840
<6-11,RYAN>看起来泰德可能是在洗车店被杀的
<6-11,RYAN>Looks like Ted might've been killed in an auto body shop.

179
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,890
<6-12,ESPOSITO>他有车吗
<6-12,ESPOSITO>Did he even own a car?

180
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,480
<6-13,RYAN>没有  但他们鉴定了泰德衣服上的泥
<6-13,RYAN>No, but they identified that sludge on Ted's clothes.

181
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:37,090
<6-13,RYAN>是混着红色油漆斑点的液压油
<6-13,RYAN>It's hydraulic fluid mixed with red paint flecks.

182
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:39,640
<6-13,RYAN>那种油漆是具有大量挥发性有机化合物的
<6-13,RYAN>Now the paint is urethane-based with high levels

183
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:43,050
<6-13,RYAN>聚氨酯系混合物  所以很可能是
<6-13,RYAN>of a volatile organic compound, so it's most likely

184
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:45,480
<6-13,RYAN>来自一辆90年代前喷漆的车
<6-13,RYAN>from a car painted prior to the 1990s.

185
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,340
<6-14,BECKETT>好  排查泰德家周围的洗车店
<6-14,BECKETT>Okay, canvass the auto shops near Ted's place.

186
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,620
<6-14,BECKETT>也许有人在其中一家看到过他
<6-14,BECKETT>Maybe he was seen at one of them.

187
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,100
<6-16,CASTLE>贝克特  我们有发现了
<6-16,CASTLE>Beckett, we got something.

189
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:56,360
<7-1,CASTLE>泰德的笔记本电脑就像增强版的诺克斯堡
<7-1,CASTLE>Now, Ted's laptop is like Fort Knox on steroids.

190
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,020
<7-1,CASTLE>但托瑞在一个服务器集标识符的注册表中
<7-1,CASTLE>But Tory found some unscrambled artifacts in the registry

191
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,710
<7-1,CASTLE>找到了一些译码工具
<7-1,CASTLE>to a service set identifier.

192
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,150
<7-1,CASTLE>我也不知道那是什么意思
<7-1,CASTLE>I don't know what that means either,

193
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,280
<7-1,CASTLE>但她对此表示很兴奋
<7-1,CASTLE>but she got really excited about it.

194
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,260
<7-1,CASTLE>这就是原因
<7-1,CASTLE>And here's why.

195
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:09,310
<7-2,TORI>昨天下午7点19泰德连上了一个
<7-2,TORI>Yesterday at 7:19 P.M. Ted connected

196
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:12,380
<7-2,TORI>私人电脑网络的专用服务器
<7-2,TORI>to a dedicated server of a private computer network.

197
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:15,130
<7-2,TORI>我追踪了那个网络  它属于...
<7-2,TORI>I traced the network. It belongs to...

198
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:17,010
<7-3,CASTLE>通用银行咨询公司
<7-3,CASTLE>Universal Banking Solutions.

199
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,080
<7-2,TORI>他们的总部在芝加哥  但在全球
<7-2,TORI>They're based in Chicago but have satellite offices

200
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,430
<7-2,TORI>都有办事处  曼哈顿也有
<7-2,TORI>all over the world, including Manhattan,

201
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,060
<7-2,TORI>泰德就是连上了那里
<7-2,TORI>which is where Ted connected.

202
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,610
<7-3,CASTLE>根据网站的描述  通用银行咨询公司
<7-3,CASTLE>Now according to the web site, "Universal Banking Solutions

203
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:27,360
<7-3,CASTLE>为国际客户处理
<7-3,CASTLE>handles strategic and tactical procurements

204
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,920
<7-3,CASTLE>战略和战术采购问题
<7-3,CASTLE>for international clients."

205
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,280
<7-4,BECKETT>那是什么意思
<7-4,BECKETT>And what does that mean?

206
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,760
<7-5,CASTLE>我不知道  我只是在念屏幕上的字
<7-5,CASTLE>I-I don't--I was just reading the screen there.

207
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,060
<7-6,BECKETT>泰德连上服务器之后做了什么
<7-6,BECKETT>Okay, so what did Ted do when he connected to the server?

208
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:37,450
<7-7,TORI>根本无从而知  他可能发了封邮件
<7-7,TORI>It's impossible to tell. He could've sent an e-mail

209
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:39,540
<7-7,TORI>或者上了网站
<7-7,TORI>or accessed the web site.

210
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:40,850
<7-8,BECKETT>或者黑掉了它
<7-8,BECKETT>Or he hacked it.

211
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:42,960
<7-9,TORI>有可能  不管他做了什么  那之后
<7-9,TORI>That, too. Whatever he did, it was the last time

212
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,270
<7-9,TORI>直到他死去  电脑再没人用过了
<7-9,TORI>this laptop was used before he died.

213
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:47,720
<7-10,BECKETT>曼哈顿办事处的负责人是谁
<7-10,BECKETT>Okay, so, who runs the Manhattan office?

214
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:51,690
<7-11,TORI>安德森·克洛斯
<7-11,TORI>Anderson Cross.

215
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,620
<7-12,BECKETT>去问问克洛斯先生知不知道泰德想干什么
<7-12,BECKETT>All right, let's see if Mr. Cross knows what Ted was up to.

216
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,910
<8-1,BECKETT>我说不好  卡塞尔  也许你妈妈是对的
<8-1,BECKETT>I don't know, Castle. Maybe your mom's right.

217
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,330
<8-1,BECKETT>我觉得私奔是个好主意
<8-1,BECKETT>I think elopement's a great idea.

218
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:01,100
<8-1,BECKETT>不用计划  不用列宾客名单
<8-1,BECKETT>There's no planning, no lists.

219
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,000
<8-1,BECKETT>我们只需要结婚就行了
<8-1,BECKETT>All we do is we just get married.

220
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,980
<8-2,CASTLE>贝克特  我向你承诺  我们完美的婚礼
<8-2,CASTLE>Beckett, I promise you, there is a perfect date

221

<8-2,CASTLE>for our perfect wedding, and we will find it.

222
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:09,060
<8-3,BECKETT>-相信我  -我相信
<8-3,BECKETT>- Trust me. - I do.

223
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,060
<8-4,CASTLE>婚礼的幽默  不错
<8-4,CASTLE>Oh, wedding humor. Nice.

224
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,010
<8-5,BECKETT>我们得和安德森·克洛斯谈谈
<8-5,BECKETT>We need to speak with Anderson Cross.

225
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,490
<8-6,RECEPTIONIST>让我看看他有没有空
<8-6,RECEPTIONIST>Let me see if he's available.

<8-9,ANDERSON CROSS>But you cannot react.

230

<8-12,RECEPTIONIST>抱歉  克洛斯先生没接电话
<8-12,RECEPTIONIST>Sorry, Mr. Cross isn't picking up.

<8-13,CROSS>I'm Anderson Cross.

237
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:43,950
<8-14,BECKETT>你好  我是凯特·贝克特探长
<8-14,BECKETT>Hi. I'm Detective Kate Beckett.

238
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:44,610
<8-14,BECKETT>纽约警察局
<8-14,BECKETT>N.Y.P.D.

239
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:47,850
<8-15,CROSS>贝克特探长  很高兴见到你
<8-15,CROSS>Detective Beckett, so nice to meet you.

240
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,940
<8-16,BECKETT>这位是理查德·卡塞尔
<8-16,BECKETT>And, uh, this is Richard Castle.

241
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,230
<8-17,CROSS>抱歉  没听清你叫什么
<8-17,CROSS>Sorry. I didn't get the name.

242
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:54,260
<8-18,CASTLE>理查德  理查德·卡塞尔
<8-18,CASTLE>Richard. Richard Castle.

243
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:58,890
<8-19,CROSS>不如我们去会议室谈吧
<8-19,CROSS>So why don't we go on into the conference room where we can talk?

244
00:08:58,890 --> 00:08:59,940
<8-20,BECKETT>好的
<8-20,BECKETT>Yes.

245
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,230
<8-21,CASTLE>老爸怎么是你
<8-21,CASTLE>Dad?

246
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,530
<8-22,CROSS>什么都别说
<8-22,CROSS>Not a word.

256
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,470
<9-1,CROSS>我并不是想催促你们
<9-1,CROSS>So, I don't mean to rush us,

257
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:19,170
<9-1,CROSS>但过几分钟我还有个约会
<9-1,CROSS>but I do have an appointment in a few minutes.

258
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:21,610
<9-2,BECKETT>实际上用不了多久  克洛斯先生
<9-2,BECKETT>Actually, this won't take very long, Mr. Cross.

259
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:24,650
<9-2,BECKETT>你认识一个叫泰德·罗林斯的人吗
<9-2,BECKETT>Um, do you know a man named Ted Rollins?

260
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,290
<9-3,CROSS>我想我不认识  怎么了
<9-3,CROSS>No, I... I don't believe I do. Why?

261
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:30,190
<9-4,BECKETT>他昨晚被杀害了
<9-4,BECKETT>He was murdered last night.

262
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:33,730
<9-4,BECKETT>好吧
<9-4,BECKETT>Okay.

263
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:36,110
<9-5,CROSS>我不明白这跟我有什么关系
<9-5,CROSS>I'm not sure what that has to do with me.

264
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:38,220
<9-6,BECKETT>我们查出昨晚7点19左右
<9-6,BECKETT>Well, we believe that he tried to access your network

265
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,260
<9-6,BECKETT>他曾试图登录你的网络
<9-6,BECKETT>yesterday evening around 7:19.

266
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,540
<9-6,BECKETT>你知道他为什么要这么做吗
<9-6,BECKETT>Do you have any idea why he would do that?

267
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:47,400
<9-7,CROSS>实际上  我刚刚接到信息技术中心的报告
<9-7,CROSS>Well, as a matter of fact, I just got a report from my I.T. people

268
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,150
<9-7,CROSS>说昨晚确实有人尝试入侵我们的系统
<9-7,CROSS>saying that someone tried to hack into our system

269
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:52,400
<9-7,CROSS>大概就在你说的那个时间
<9-7,CROSS>around about that time.

270
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,490
<9-8,BECKETT>贵公司具体是做什么业务的
<9-8,BECKETT>And what exactly does your company do?

271
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,550
<9-9,CROSS>我们的主要业务是处理百万元级别的货币交易
<9-9,CROSS>Well, we basically handle, uh, multi-million dollar

272
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:01,130
<9-9,CROSS>客户包括各大银行
<9-9,CROSS>currency transactions for banks,

273
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:04,860
<9-9,CROSS>国际贸易公司和其他国家
<9-9,CROSS>international businesses, uh, foreign countries and the like.

274
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,160
<9-10,CASTLE>也许泰德是想黑进来
<9-10,CASTLE>Maybe Ted was trying to, uh... tap in and steal

275
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,110
<9-10,CASTLE>然后从某桩交易中得利
<9-10,CASTLE>from one of those transactions.

276
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,510
<9-11,CROSS>如果真是这样
<9-11,CROSS>Well, if he did...

277
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,890
<9-11,CROSS>那他就是空手而归了
<9-11,CROSS>he was quite unsuccessful.

278
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:17,040
<9-12,BECKETT>之前有人入侵过你公司的网络吗
<9-12,BECKETT>Has anyone tried to hack into your company's network before?

279
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,740
<9-13,CROSS>当然  但是我们有强大的防火墙系统
<9-13,CROSS>Oh, yes. But we have quite a robust firewall system.

280
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,310
<9-13,CROSS>从来未被攻破过
<9-13,CROSS>It's never been breached.

281
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,330
<9-14,BECKETT>你是否可以将昨晚和之前的
<9-14,BECKETT>Um, well, would you mind giving me copies

282
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:26,940
<9-14,BECKETT>入侵者入侵报告给我一份
<9-14,BECKETT>of your incursion reports along with the ones from last night?

283
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,800
<9-15,CROSS>乐意效劳  等下就发给你
<9-15,CROSS>Of course. I'll send them right over to you.

284
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,980
<9-16,BECKETT>谢谢  感谢你的配合
<9-16,BECKETT>Okay, thank you. Thanks for your time.

285
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,490
<9-17,BECKETT>很抱歉  克洛斯先生
<9-17,BECKETT>I'm sorry, Mr. Cross, uh,

286
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:36,870
<9-17,BECKETT>我们以前见过吗
<9-17,BECKETT>have we ever met before?

287
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,620
<9-18,CROSS>我没有印象
<9-18,CROSS>I don't believe we have.

288
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:42,220
<9-19,BECKETT>真的吗  但你看起来很面熟
<9-19,BECKETT>Really? Because you just seem so familiar.

289
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,560
<9-20,CROSS>是吗
<9-20,CROSS>Really?

290
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,320
<9-22,CROSS>我确实长了张大众脸
<9-22,CROSS>Uh-huh. I have one of those faces.

291
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,410
<9-23,BECKETT>蕾妮发现了些线索  我们该走了
<9-23,BECKETT>Um, Lanie's got something for us. We should go.

292
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:52,550
<9-25,BECKETT>-太好了  -谢谢你
<9-25,BECKETT>- Great. - Thank you.

293
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,760
<9-26,CROSS>不客气  乐意效劳
<9-26,CROSS>Not at all. My pleasure.

294
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:00,700
<10-1,LANIE>我可能知道为什么
<10-1,LANIE>Okay, so I may know why

295
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,510
<10-1,LANIE>泰德两只鞋的鞋带绑得不一样了
<10-1,LANIE>one of Ted's shoes was tied differently.

296
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,580
<10-1,LANIE>凶手当时是在找东西
<10-1,LANIE>The killer was looking for something.

297
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,240
<10-2,BECKETT>在他的鞋里吗
<10-2,BECKETT>In his shoes?

298
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:11,990
<10-3,LANIE>没错  泰德死的时候右脚袜子里有一枚硬币
<10-3,LANIE>Yep. At the time of his death, Ted had a coin in his right sock.

299
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:14,670
<10-3,LANIE>因为尸体变得僵硬  所以留下了一个印子
<10-3,LANIE>Due to rigor mortis, an impression remained,

300
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,810
<10-3,LANIE>上面还有模糊的图案  看到没
<10-3,LANIE>including these faint markings. You see that?

301
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:18,980
<10-4,BECKETT>真的啊
<10-4,BECKETT>Yeah. Wow.

302
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:22,190
<10-5,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<10-5,BECKETT>Hey, Castle.

303
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,310
<10-5,BECKETT>你有在听吗
<10-5,BECKETT>You with us?

304
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,790
<10-6,CASTLE>有啊  当然有了
<10-6,CASTLE>Yeah. Yeah, of course.

305
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,380
<10-7,BECKETT>我们理一下头绪
<10-7,BECKETT>Uh... let me get this straight.

306
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:31,580
<10-7,BECKETT>泰德被枪击后  凶手脱下了他的鞋和袜子
<10-7,BECKETT>So, after Ted was shot, the killer took off the shoe and the sock,

307
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,980
<10-7,BECKETT>抢走了硬币  再原样穿好
<10-7,BECKETT>grabbed the coin and then put the shoe and sock back on?

308
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,250
<10-8,CASTLE>一定是枚非常值钱的硬币
<10-8,CASTLE>Must've been a valuable coin.

309
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:38,380
<10-9,LANIE>实际上还真的不是  我将图像增强了一下
<10-9,LANIE>Actually, it wasn't. I did some enhancement.

310
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:41,870
<10-9,LANIE>根据硬币的直径和图案
<10-9,LANIE>And based on the coin's diameter and the markings,

311
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:44,180
<10-9,LANIE>确定这是一枚伊朗里亚尔
<10-9,LANIE>we've identified it as an Iranian Rial,

312
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:45,710
<10-9,LANIE>面值比一美分还小
<10-9,LANIE>worth less than a penny.

313
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,220
<10-10,BECKETT>一枚伊朗里亚尔
<10-10,BECKETT>Wow, an Iranian Rial, huh?

314
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:50,680
<10-10,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<10-10,BECKETT>Castle?

315
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,230
<10-11,BECKETT>你没有什么关于国际大阴谋
<10-11,BECKETT>No... theories on international intrigue

316
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:55,230
<10-11,BECKETT>秘密间谍之类的理论要说吗
<10-11,BECKETT>or covert espionage?

317
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:58,970
<10-12,CASTLE>线索太少了  这个时候说那些还为时过早
<10-12,CASTLE>We really don't have the information to speculate at this point.

318
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,020
<10-12,CASTLE>好吧
<10-12,CASTLE>Okay.

319
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,530
<10-13,BECKETT>你能缩小泰德的遇害地点范围吗
<10-13,BECKETT>Were you able to narrow down where Ted was killed?

320
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:06,000
<10-14,LANIE>不能  但我确实检查了他的胃部残留物
<10-14,LANIE>No, but I did check his stomach contents.

321
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,870
<10-14,LANIE>我可以告诉你  死前15分钟左右
<10-14,LANIE>And I can tell you this-- approximately 15 minutes before his death,

322
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:12,800
<10-14,LANIE>泰德吃过蛤蜊和油炸饼
<10-14,LANIE>Ted ate clams and funnel cake.

323
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,420
<10-14,LANIE>你们能相信吗
<10-14,LANIE>Can you believe that?

324
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,250
<10-15,BECKETT>蕾妮  你的工作就是解剖死人
<10-15,BECKETT>Lanie, you slice open dead people for a living

325
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,610
<10-15,BECKETT>却觉得这个很恶心吗
<10-15,BECKETT>and you're grossed out by that?

326
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:21,150
<10-16,LANIE>强大如我也是有弱点嘛
<10-16,LANIE>Even I have my limits.

327
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:23,600
<10-17,BECKETT>好了  蛤蜊和油炸饼
<10-17,BECKETT>Okay, fine, uh, clams and funnel cake.

328
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,690
<10-17,BECKETT>听上去像是游乐场的小吃
<10-17,BECKETT>That sounds like he had amusement park food.

329
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:28,350
<10-18,CASTLE>没错  再加上泰德衣服上的
<10-18,CASTLE>Right, and the hydraulic fluid

330
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:29,860
<10-18,CASTLE>液压液和红色油漆
<10-18,CASTLE>and red paint on Ted's clothes?

331
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:32,280
<10-18,CASTLE>他确实到过游乐场  而且我还知道是哪一个
<10-18,CASTLE>He was at an amusement park, and I can tell you which one.

332
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:32,990
<10-19,LANIE>你怎么知道的
<10-19,LANIE>How?

333
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:35,310
<10-20,CASTLE>作为一个嘉年华小吃的行家
<10-20,CASTLE>Well, as a connoisseur of carny food,

334
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:36,660
<10-20,CASTLE>只有一个游乐场
<10-20,CASTLE>there's only one amusement park

335
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,850
<10-20,CASTLE>同时提供煎蛤蜊和油炸饼
<10-20,CASTLE>that has both fried clams and funnel cake,

336
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:39,780
<10-20,CASTLE>那个游乐场就是
<10-20,CASTLE>and that park is...

337
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,140
<10-21,BECKETT>科尼岛
<10-21,BECKETT>Coney Island.

338
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:45,750
<10-22,LANIE>你们两个心有灵犀的感觉真是毛骨悚然
<10-22,LANIE>Okay, you two creep me out when you do that shared brain thing.

340
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:48,430
<10-23,CASTLE>呃  我
<10-23,CASTLE>Uh, I...

341
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:52,720
<10-23,CASTLE>我忘了  我得去出趟版商那里
<10-23,CASTLE>Hey, I-I forgot I had to... drop by my publisher's.

342
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,460
<10-23,CASTLE>看看...排版毛条
<10-23,CASTLE>We gotta look at the... galleys.

343
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:57,170
<10-23,CASTLE>是另一本...德里克·斯道姆小说的
<10-23,CASTLE>There's another-- uh, for the Derrick Storm... novels.

344
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,490
<10-23,CASTLE>有个排版毛条...
<10-23,CASTLE>There's the galley, and, uh...

345
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,420
<10-23,CASTLE>太好了  谢谢  贝克特
<10-23,CASTLE>Great. Thanks. Hey, Beckett!

346
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,210
<11-1,RYAN>科尼岛维护部负责人说
<11-1,RYAN>The head of Coney Island's maintenance staff

347
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:06,750
<11-1,RYAN>只有一个地方会出现液压机液体和油漆
<11-1,RYAN>said that the only place there would be hydraulic fluid,

348
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:10,300
<11-1,RYAN>就是过山车下方的维修区域
<11-1,RYAN>and paint is the repair facility under the roller coaster.

349
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:12,400
<11-2,BECKETT>让公园保安部去检查一下
<11-2,BECKETT>Okay, let's have park security check it out for us.

350
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,280
<11-3,RYAN>已经查了
<11-3,RYAN>They have,

351
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,790
<11-3,RYAN>发现了血迹
<11-3,RYAN>and they found blood.

352
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:34,310
<11-3,RYAN>这肯定就是泰德被杀的现场
<11-3,RYAN>Well, this is definitely where Ted was killed.

353
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,490
<12-1,BECKETT>为什么在这儿  他来干什么
<12-1,BECKETT>Why here? What was he up to?

354
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:39,640
<12-2,RYAN>油炸饼摊主记得泰德
<12-2,RYAN>Yo, funnel cake vendor remembered seeing Ted.

355
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,760
<12-3,ESPOSITO>说他买了油炸饼后向这边走了
<12-3,ESPOSITO>Said he got his food and walked in this direction.

356
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:42,820
<12-4,BECKETT>有人同行吗
<12-4,BECKETT>Was he with anyone?

357
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,700
<12-5,ESPOSITO>-他没看到  -凶手一定是跟踪至此
<12-5,ESPOSITO>- Not that he saw. - Killer must've followed him.

358
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,000
<12-7,BECKETT>说不定是他们约好在这见面
<12-7,BECKETT>Or maybe they came here to meet.

359
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,500
<12-8,ESPOSITO>凶手为什么不留下尸体
<12-8,ESPOSITO>Yeah, why wouldn't the killer leave the body here?

360
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:49,240
<12-8,ESPOSITO>为什么要费劲带回曼哈顿
<12-8,ESPOSITO>Why would he drag it all the way back to Manhattan

361
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,360
<12-8,ESPOSITO>放回被害人家里
<12-8,ESPOSITO>to the victim's own apartment?

362
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,710
<12-9,RYAN>误导我们
<12-9,RYAN>To throw us off his trail.

363
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:56,600
<12-10,BECKETT>也可能凶手之所以不想暴露犯罪现场
<12-10,BECKETT>Or maybe the killer didn't want us to find the crime scene

364
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,530
<12-10,BECKETT>是因为现场有能指明他犯罪的证据
<12-10,BECKETT>because there's something here that ties him to the murder.

365
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,760
<12-10,BECKETT>这里有监控录像吗
<12-10,BECKETT>Do they have security cameras here?

366
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,610
<12-11,ESPOSITO>只有一个监控着南门
<12-11,ESPOSITO>Just that one covering the south entrance.

367
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:05,570
<12-12,BECKETT>和公园保卫处谈谈
<12-12,BECKETT>Okay, let's talk to park security.

368
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:07,590
<12-12,BECKETT>让他们提供一份监控录像
<12-12,BECKETT>Get them to give us the surveillance footage.

369
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:20,600
<13-1,CASTLE>给你
<13-1,CASTLE>There you go.

370
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,990
<13-2,HOMELESS GUY>-上帝保佑你  -谢谢
<13-2,HOMELESS GUY>- God bless you, man. - Yeah.

371
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,670
<13-4,CROSS>坐我后面
<13-4,CROSS>Sit behind me.

372
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,540
<13-5,CASTLE>没想到还会再见你
<13-5,CASTLE>Never thought I'd see you again.

373
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,230
<13-6,CROSS>泰德·罗林斯
<13-6,CROSS>Ted Rollins.

374
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:40,520
<13-6,CROSS>你的被害人  你都知道些什么
<13-6,CROSS>Your victim. What have you learned?

375
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,610
<13-7,CASTLE>我都知道...
<13-7,CASTLE>What have I le--

376
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:47,420
<13-7,CASTLE>抱歉  一年前  我都还不认识你
<13-7,CASTLE>I'm sorry, until a year ago, I had no idea who you were,

377
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,100
<13-7,CASTLE>你现在突然出现
<13-7,CASTLE>and now you come out of the blue,

378
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,820
<13-7,CASTLE>就说一句
<13-7,CASTLE>and the only thing you have to say is,

379
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,080
<13-7,CASTLE>你都知道些什么
<13-7,CASTLE>"What have you learned?"

380
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,470
<13-7,CASTLE>总该问句  儿子  过的怎么样吧
<13-7,CASTLE>How about a, "Hello, son. How you been?"

381
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:58,700
<13-8,CROSS>你在感情用事  现在不是时候
<13-8,CROSS>You're getting emotional. Now is not the time.

382
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,260
<13-8,CROSS>是吗
<13-8,CROSS>Really?

383
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:01,030
<13-9,CASTLE>40年来都不是时候
<13-9,CASTLE>Cause it's been about 40 years,

384
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,560
<13-9,CASTLE>那什么时候合适
<13-9,CASTLE>so when would be a good time?

385
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,150
<13-10,CROSS>就我的工作而言  永远不合适
<13-10,CROSS>With what I do? Never.

386
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:06,580
<13-10,CROSS>你忘了巴黎的事了吗
<13-10,CROSS>Or did you forget what happened in paris?

387
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,040
<13-11,CASTLE>没有  怎么会忘
<13-11,CASTLE>No. How could I forget?

388
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,810
<13-12,CROSS>那就要以之为鉴
<13-12,CROSS>Then stop acting like you did.

389
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,860
<13-12,CROSS>你知道我的工作  身份
<13-12,CROSS>You know what I do. You know who I am.

390
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,130
<13-12,CROSS>我不谨慎就会带来伤亡
<13-12,CROSS>I let my guard down, people die.

391
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:17,000
<13-13,CASTLE>比如泰德
<13-13,CASTLE>People like Ted?

392
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,340
<13-13,CASTLE>他到底是谁  凶手又是谁
<13-13,CASTLE>So who was he really? Who killed him?

393
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,650
<13-14,CROSS>你得先告诉我你的消息
<13-14,CROSS>You need to tell me what you know.

394
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:26,700
<13-15,CASTLE>你不信任我
<13-15,CASTLE>You don't trust me.

395
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:28,690
<13-16,CROSS>信任比子弹更危险
<13-16,CROSS>Trust kills faster than bullets.

396
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,830
<13-16,CROSS>马上有大事要发生
<13-16,CROSS>Look, there's a storm coming,

397
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:34,750
<13-16,CROSS>我要是不阻止  就会出现更多伤亡
<13-16,CROSS>and if I don't stop it, a lot more people are gonna die.

398
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:36,590
<13-16,CROSS>告诉我你得到的信息
<13-16,CROSS>Just tell me what you know.

399
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:43,300
<13-17,CASTLE>他在科尼岛的过山车下被枪杀
<13-17,CASTLE>He was shot at Coney Island under the roller coaster.

400
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,480
<13-17,CASTLE>袜子里有一个硬币
<13-17,CASTLE>There was a coin in his sock,

401
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:47,130
<13-17,CASTLE>是个伊朗里亚尔
<13-17,CASTLE>an Iranian rial.

402
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:48,250
<13-18,CROSS>硬币在你这吗
<13-18,CROSS>Do you have the coin?

403
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,830
<13-19,CASTLE>凶手拿走了
<13-19,CASTLE>No, the killer took it.

404
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:51,510
<13-19,CASTLE>为什么  拿走硬币意味着什么
<13-19,CASTLE>Why would he do that? What does that mean?

405
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:52,750
<13-20,CROSS>意味着我要走了
<13-20,CROSS>It means I gotta go.

406
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,610
<13-20,CROSS>有什么新消息及时发短信
<13-20,CROSS>If there's any update, text me.

407
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:57,660
<13-20,CROSS>说要见面  30分钟内我就会来这等你
<13-20,CROSS>Say you need to meet, and I'll be back here within 30 minutes.

408
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,570
<13-20,CROSS>别跟任何人提起我
<13-20,CROSS>Don't tell anyone about this, about me.

409
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:03,060
<13-20,CROSS>你的未婚妻也不行
<13-20,CROSS>Not even your fiancee.

410
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,340
<13-21,CASTLE>你怎么知道我们订婚了
<13-21,CASTLE>How'd you know we were engaged?

411
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:07,090
<13-22,CROSS>虽然我做的不好
<13-22,CROSS>Well, I may not be good at it,

412
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,330
<13-22,CROSS>但我还是你父亲
<13-22,CROSS>but I am still your father.

413
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:11,740
<13-22,CROSS>现在起保持缄默
<13-22,CROSS>Now keep your mouth shut,

414
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,120
<13-22,CROSS>免得我们性命难保
<13-22,CROSS>and let's try not to get us both killed.

415
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:27,370
<13-22,CROSS>怎么了
<13-22,CROSS>What's wrong?

416
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:29,450
<14-1,BECKETT>不喜欢你漫画小说的画作吗
<14-1,BECKETT>You don't like the artwork for your graphic novel?

417
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:31,920
<14-2,CASTLE>不是  画的很好
<14-2,CASTLE>Oh, no, no, it's great. It's good, it's, um...

418
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:34,370
<14-2,CASTLE>是科尼岛没错吧
<14-2,CASTLE>So we were right about Coney Island, huh?

419
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:35,890
<14-3,BECKETT>对  一个谜团解开了
<14-3,BECKETT>Yes. One mystery solved.

420
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:37,600
<14-3,BECKETT>只是它带来了更多谜团
<14-3,BECKETT>Only it's led us to a few new ones,

421
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,680
<14-3,BECKETT>比如泰德为什么要去
<14-3,BECKETT>like what was Ted doing there in the first place?

422
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:43,230
<14-5,BECKETT>-确实奇怪  -是令人费解
<14-5,BECKETT>- Yeah. It's weird. - It's more than weird.

423
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:45,420
<14-5,BECKETT>你没觉得这事后面有隐情吗
<14-5,BECKETT>Something bigger's going on here, don't you think?

424
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:48,330
<14-6,ESPOSITO>你们俩
<14-6,ESPOSITO>Hey, guys.

425
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,150
<14-6,ESPOSITO>来看看这个
<14-6,ESPOSITO>Come check this out.

426
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:52,500
<15-1,ESPOSITO>这是过山车维修区域
<15-1,ESPOSITO>This is surveillance from that security camera

427
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,910
<15-1,ESPOSITO>入口的监控录像
<15-1,ESPOSITO>at the entrance of the roller coaster repair yard.

428
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,290
<15-1,ESPOSITO>泰德在晚上8点47分独自进入
<15-1,ESPOSITO>Ted enters alone at 8:47 p.M.

429
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:59,290
<15-2,CASTLE>在他之前有人进去吗
<15-2,CASTLE>Did anyone enter prior to that?

430
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:02,080
<15-3,TORI>没有  但是9点04
<15-3,TORI>No. But about 15 minutes later at

431
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,880
<15-3,TORI>也就是15分钟后有人进去
<15-3,TORI>9:04 p.M., someone does.

432
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:07,380
<15-4,BECKETT>等等  暂停  放大画面
<15-4,BECKETT>Wait. Zoom in and freeze it.

433
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:11,740
<15-4,BECKETT>那是安德森·克洛斯
<15-4,BECKETT>That's Anderson Cross.

434
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,280
<15-5,BECKETT>天哪  他是凶手
<15-5,BECKETT>Oh, my god. He's our killer.

435
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:21,380
<15-5,BECKETT>凶手就是安德森·克洛斯
<15-5,BECKETT>This whole time it was Anderson Cross.

436
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:23,420
<16-1,BECKETT>泰德肯定是成功入侵他的系统了
<16-1,BECKETT>So Ted must've hacked into his system,

437
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:25,810
<16-1,BECKETT>但他决定亲手解决
<16-1,BECKETT>and he decided to take matters into his own hands.

438
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:29,110
<16-2,CASTLE>不太可能吧
<16-2,CASTLE>But that doesn't seem likely.

439
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:32,940
<16-2,CASTLE>我看他不像那种人
<16-2,CASTLE>I mean, he really doesn't seem the type.

440
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,570
<16-2,CASTLE>卡塞尔  你说什么呢
<16-2,CASTLE>Castle, what are you talking about?

441
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:36,660
<16-3,BECKETT>他说谎了  他声称不认识泰德
<16-3,BECKETT>He lied to us. He told us he didn'tnow Ted,

442
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,090
<16-3,BECKETT>却出现在犯罪现场
<16-3,BECKETT>and there he is at the crime scene.

443
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,890
<16-4,CASTLE>又没看到他实施犯罪
<16-4,CASTLE>We don't actually see him commit murder.

444
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:41,810
<16-4,CASTLE>这个地方的入口也不止一处
<16-4,CASTLE>There's a number of entrances to that area,

445
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:42,600
<16-4,CASTLE>但只有一个摄像头
<16-4,CASTLE>but there's only one camera.

446
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,730
<16-4,CASTLE>我只是觉得不该臆断
<16-4,CASTLE>It just... may not be what it seems.

447
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:45,980
<16-5,ESPOSITO>还有别的解释吗  他就刚好在
<16-5,ESPOSITO>So, what? He just happened to be there

448
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:47,930
<16-5,ESPOSITO>泰德入侵他公司系统两小时后去了公园
<16-5,ESPOSITO>Two hours after Ted hacked his company?

449
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:54,830
<16-6,CASTLE>认定安德森·克洛斯是凶手吗
<16-6,CASTLE>I'm... just saying that Anderson Cross is the killer?

450
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:56,740
<16-6,CASTLE>这只是我们显而易见的选择
<16-6,CASTLE>It's just the obvious choice.

451
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,230
<16-7,ESPOSITO>所有证据都指向同一嫌疑人时
<16-7,ESPOSITO>Well, that's usually what happens

452
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,970
<16-7,ESPOSITO>都指向同一嫌疑人时  我们就会这样做
<16-7,ESPOSITO>when all the evidence points to a suspect.

453
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:00,850
<16-8,BECKETT>我们得找他来问话
<16-8,BECKETT>We have to get him down here.

454
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:02,650
<16-8,BECKETT>找出他公司的所有资料
<16-8,BECKETT>Pull up everything you can on his company.

455
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,460
<16-9,TORI>-这不可能  -怎么了
<16-9,TORI>- This makes no sense. - What?

456
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,990
<16-10,ESPOSITO>什么都没了  找不到网站了
<16-10,ESPOSITO>It's gone. The site disappeared.

457
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,210
<16-11,TORI>不只是网站  他公司存在的痕迹也不见了
<16-11,TORI>Actually, not just the site. Every trace of the company.

458
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:14,670
<16-12,BECKETT>找到安德森·克洛斯
<16-12,BECKETT>Find Anderson Cross now.

459
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:18,200
<16-13,BECKETT>他到底是谁
<16-13,BECKETT>Who the hell is this guy?

460
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,970
<16-13,BECKETT>很显然他不是银行家
<16-13,BECKETT>He's obviously not a banker.

461
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:24,680
<16-13,BECKETT>我知道为什么看他那么眼熟了
<16-13,BECKETT>I know why he looks familiar.

462
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,840
<16-15,BECKETT>-你去哪儿  -去证实我的想法
<16-15,BECKETT>- Where you going? - To check something.

463
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:30,970
<17-1,CASTLE>接电话  快接电话
<17-1,CASTLE>Pick up, pick up.

<17-5,ESPOSITO>Damn, bro. Why you so jumpy?

470
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,360
<18-1,ESPOSITO>这个安德森·克洛斯
<18-1,ESPOSITO>So, this guy, Anderson Cross,

471
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:50,200
<18-1,ESPOSITO>就像你小说里的反派
<18-1,ESPOSITO>is like a villain in one of your books.

472
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,330
<18-1,ESPOSITO>像是知道我们要去  他的办公室清空了
<18-1,ESPOSITO>His office was cleared out like he knew we were coming.

473
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:54,060
<18-2,CASTLE>-一点线索都没有吗  -啥也没有
<18-2,CASTLE>- There wasn't a trace of him? - Nothin'.

474
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,110
<18-3,ESPOSITO>就连他的接待员
<18-3,ESPOSITO>Even his receptionist.

475
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,520
<18-3,ESPOSITO>都是从短工中介雇来的
<18-3,ESPOSITO>She was hired from a temp agency.

476
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:58,650
<18-3,ESPOSITO>昨天才开始工作  她一无所知
<18-3,ESPOSITO>Just started working yesterday. She doesn't know jack.

477
00:18:58,650 --> 00:18:59,860
<18-4,RYAN>大楼管理者也不清楚状况
<18-4,RYAN>Neither did the building manager.

478
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:02,830
<18-4,RYAN>他说克洛斯上个月租了那地方
<18-4,RYAN>He said that Cross rented the place from him last month,

479
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:05,200
<18-4,RYAN>用支票付了全年的租金
<18-4,RYAN>paid for a year's lease with a cashier's check.

480
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,250
<18-4,RYAN>所以根本无迹可寻
<18-4,RYAN>So it's totally untraceable.

481
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,200
<18-5,ESPOSITO>不管这人是谁  他绝非善类
<18-5,ESPOSITO>Yeah, whoever this guy is, he's in a different league.

482
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:10,410
<18-6,BECKETT>而且我们跟他以前有过交集
<18-6,BECKETT>And we've crossed paths before.

483
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,000
<18-7,CASTLE>什么意思
<18-7,CASTLE>What do you mean?

484
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,420
<18-8,BECKETT>看看这个  记得这个人吗
<18-8,BECKETT>Check this out. Remember this guy?

485
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:18,490
<18-8,BECKETT>去年阿丽克西斯被绑架的案子
<18-8,BECKETT>Alexis's kidnapping last year.

486
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,960
<18-9,RYAN>天啊  就是他
<18-9,RYAN>Damn, that's right. Uh...

487
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,440
<18-9,RYAN>目击者在绑架案相关地点
<18-9,RYAN>Witnesses kept seeing him pop up

488
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,170
<18-9,RYAN>多次看到他出现
<18-9,RYAN>at locations associated with her abduction.

489
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:24,220
<18-10,ESPOSITO>而这些地方通常都会出现
<18-10,ESPOSITO>And at each one of those locations,

490
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,260
<18-10,ESPOSITO>一具死尸
<18-10,ESPOSITO>there was a dead body.

491
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,180
<18-11,BECKETT>我把监控视频传给了一个在总检察长办公室
<18-11,BECKETT>So I sent the video surveillance to a friend of mine

492
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,690
<18-11,BECKETT>工作的朋友  他查到了匹配记录
<18-11,BECKETT>in the A.G.'s office, and he got a hit.

493
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,280
<18-11,BECKETT>他不能透露细节
<18-11,BECKETT>Now he couldn't get into details,

494
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:33,180
<18-11,BECKETT>但他说这人以前是中情局特工
<18-11,BECKETT>but he did say that this guy is a former C.I.A. Operative.

495
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,840
<18-12,CASTLE>等等  以前是
<18-12,CASTLE>Wait a minute. Former?

496
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,510
<18-13,BECKETT>对  他未经授权执行刺杀行动
<18-13,BECKETT>Yeah, he, uh, he was disowned

497
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:38,180
<18-13,BECKETT>被中情局撇清了关系
<18-13,BECKETT>for an unauthorized assassination.

498
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:40,350
<18-13,BECKETT>被判处终身监禁  但成功越狱了
<18-13,BECKETT>He was sentenced to life, broke out,

499
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:42,320
<18-13,BECKETT>过程中杀死三名狱警
<18-13,BECKETT>killed three guards in the process.

500
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,670
<18-13,BECKETT>这人是政府的通缉犯
<18-13,BECKETT>This guy's wanted by our government.

501
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:46,090
<18-13,BECKETT>我朋友说据传
<18-13,BECKETT>Now my friend said that the rumor is,

502
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:48,610
<18-13,BECKETT>他现在是职业杀手  如果我们找到他
<18-13,BECKETT>he's working as a hit man. And if we get eyes on him,

503
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:50,310
<18-13,BECKETT>希望我们联系总检察长办公室
<18-13,BECKETT>the A.G.'s office wants us to call them.

504
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:51,730
<18-13,BECKETT>到时候他们会派遣突击队
<18-13,BECKETT>So they can send in a strike team.

505
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:54,200
<18-14,RYAN>这样的人为什么要杀泰德·罗林斯呢
<18-14,RYAN>Why would a guy like this wanna kill Ted Rollins?

506
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:56,280
<18-15,ESPOSITO>更重要的是我们怎么能找到他  人家可是间谍
<18-15,ESPOSITO>More than that, how are we gonna find a former spy?

507
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,340
<18-15,ESPOSITO>掩盖踪迹是他的拿手绝活
<18-15,ESPOSITO>He's spent a lifetime covering his tracks.

508
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,080
<18-16,BECKETT>但泰德有迹可循
<18-16,BECKETT>Yeah, but Ted hasn't.

509
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,900
<18-16,BECKETT>他们之间有某些联系
<18-16,BECKETT>And somehow they're connected.

510
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:03,850
<18-17,RYAN>所以我们该去查
<18-17,RYAN>So, we should see

511
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:06,440
<18-17,RYAN>看他有没有留下线索能让我们找到疑犯
<18-17,RYAN>if Hansel left any breadcrumbs towards our suspect.

512
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,050
<18-18,BECKETT>我们得去查泰德生前的所有行踪
<18-18,BECKETT>We need to retrace every one of Ted's footsteps.

514
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:12,330
<18-18,BECKETT>凶手很了解他  还知道他住在哪儿
<18-18,BECKETT>Our killer knew him well enough to know where he lived.

515
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:14,890
<18-18,BECKETT>-他们以前肯定有过接触  -好的
<18-18,BECKETT>- I mean, they had to have had previous contact.  - Okay.

545
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:50,360
<21-2,MARTHA>但他利用了我  为了提前知道调查进度
<21-2,MARTHA>But he used me--to stay ahead of the investigation,

546
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,990
<21-3,CASTLE>以便知道何时跑路
<21-3,CASTLE>to know when to make a run for it.

547
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,350
<21-3,CASTLE>如果他是无罪的
<21-3,CASTLE>If he's innocent,

548
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:54,850
<21-3,CASTLE>为什么不去公园

<22-14,CROSS>那好  接下来的就有意思了
<22-14,CROSS>All right, now here comes the fun part.

585
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:43,780
<22-14,CROSS>你小心点  我是认真的  小心地把子弹取出来
<22-14,CROSS>Carefully, and I do mean carefuy, pull the slug out.

586
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:47,190
<22-15,CROSS>帮帮忙
<22-15,CROSS>But do me a favor.

587
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:50,820
<22-15,CROSS>尽量别点着我的鼻子
<22-15,CROSS>Try not to make my nose light up, huh?

588
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:52,680
<22-16,CASTLE>好的
<22-16,CASTLE>Right.

589
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,010
<22-17,CASTLE>那就好
<22-17,CASTLE>Okay.

590
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,240
<22-17,CASTLE>我好像找到了
<22-17,CASTLE>I think I have it.

591
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,190
<22-18,CASTLE>我找到了
<22-18,CASTLE>I got it.

592
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,330
<22-18,CASTLE>没成功  不好意思
<22-18,CASTLE>I don't got it. Sorry.

593
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:07,580
<22-19,MARTHA>小心点  理查德
<22-19,MARTHA>Careful, Richard.

594
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,530
<22-20,CROSS>现在你知道这样行不通
<22-20,CROSS>Now that you know how not to do it,

595
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,870
<22-20,CROSS>那我们就换一种方法
<22-20,CROSS>Let's try the other way.

596
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,060
<22-21,CASTLE>好的
<22-21,CASTLE>Yeah, right.

597
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:14,310
<22-22,MARTHA>-我帮你擦擦  -谢谢
<22-22,MARTHA>- Okay, let me just get you here. - Thank you.

598
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:17,890
<22-23,CASTLE>好了
<22-23,CASTLE>Okay.

599
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:24,230
<22-24,CASTLE>我应该够到了
<22-24,CASTLE>I think I have it.

600
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,270
<22-24,CASTLE>好的
<22-24,CASTLE>All right...

601
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,160
<22-25,MARTHA>我想我
<22-25,MARTHA>I think I...

602
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:30,870
<22-26,CROSS>-我取出来了  -真棒
<22-26,CROSS>- I have it. - Bravo!

603
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:31,930
<22-26,CROSS>干得不错
<22-26,CROSS>Real good.

604
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:33,410
<22-27,CASTLE>-好啦  -太好啦
<22-27,CASTLE>- There we go. - Oh, we go.

605
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:35,500
<22-28,CROSS>玛莎  把针和线递给我
<22-28,CROSS>Martha, hand me the needle and thread.

606
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,580
<22-29,MARTHA>好的  在这
<22-29,MARTHA>Uh... okay, here it is.

607
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:39,000
<22-29,MARTHA>好的
<22-29,MARTHA>And there we go.

608
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:43,280
<22-29,MARTHA>你之前自己缝过吧  我可以这么认为吗
<22-29,MARTHA>All right, you've stitched yourself up before, I take it?

609
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,200
<22-30,CROSS>至少这次我有根针
<22-30,CROSS>At least this time I got a needle.

610
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:49,990
<22-31,CASTLE>你想跟我们说说  你怎么中弹的吗
<22-31,CASTLE>So, you wanna tell us how you got shot?

611
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:52,580
<22-32,CROSS>不太想
<22-32,CROSS>Not particularly.

612
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:54,760
<22-33,CASTLE>那就说说你逃狱的时候
<22-33,CASTLE>What about the three guards you murdered

613
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,840
<22-33,CASTLE>杀掉的三个狱警吧
<22-33,CASTLE>while escaping from prison-- you wanna tell us about them?

614
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:59,180
<22-34,CROSS>不要相信你看到的一切
<22-34,CROSS>Don't believe everything you read.

615
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:00,720
<22-35,CASTLE>你没有杀掉他们
<22-35,CASTLE>So you didn't kill 'em?

616
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:02,940
<22-36,CROSS>我是系统外人员
<22-36,CROSS>I work outside the system,

617
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:05,730
<22-36,CROSS>也就是说我得有个有效的掩护身份
<22-36,CROSS>which means I need an effective cover.

618
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,380
<22-36,CROSS>受雇于人的杀手  被政府通缉
<22-36,CROSS>Hired assassin, wanted by Uncle Sam...

619
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,230
<22-36,CROSS>提供了各种可能
<22-36,CROSS>Opens a lot of doors.

620
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,520
<22-37,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<22-37,BECKETT>Castle?

621
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:16,360
<22-38,CASTLE>糟了
<22-38,CASTLE>Crap.

622
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:20,020
<23-1,BECKETT>我来看看阿丽克西斯有没有想起
<23-1,BECKETT>Hey, so I thought I'd see if Alexis remembers

623
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,870
<23-1,BECKETT>关于画像上那人的一些事情
<23-1,BECKETT>anything more about the man from the sketches.

624
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:24,800
<23-2,CASTLE>关于画像上的那个人
<23-2,CASTLE>Yeah, about the man in the sketches, um...

625
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:27,590
<23-2,CASTLE>有些事情你应该知道
<23-2,CASTLE>something you should know about him.

626
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:29,460
<23-3,BECKETT>什么
<23-3,BECKETT>What?

627
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:33,010
<23-4,CASTLE>他是你将来的公公
<23-4,CASTLE>He's your future father-in-law.

628
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:39,540
<23-5,CROSS>很高兴再见到你  凯特
<23-5,CROSS>Nice to see you again, Kate.

629
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:41,620
<23-6,MARTHA>凯瑟琳
<23-6,MARTHA>Katherine,

630
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,550
<23-6,MARTHA>我很想说事情并不是你看到的那样
<23-6,MARTHA>I wanna say this isn't what it looks like,

631
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:44,960
<23-6,MARTHA>可事实就是这样
<23-6,MARTHA>but it is.

632
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,620
<24-1,CASTLE>-我本打算告诉你的  我发誓  -什么时候
<24-1,CASTLE>- I was gonna tell you. I swear. - When?

633
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,260
<24-2,BECKETT>你把他包扎好  把他送走之后吗
<24-2,BECKETT>After you patched him up? Sent him on his merry way?

634
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,280
<24-2,BECKETT>他被政府通缉
<24-2,BECKETT>He's wanted by the government.

635
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,100
<24-2,BECKETT>你这是在窝藏逃犯
<24-2,BECKETT>You are harboring a fugitive.

636
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,300
<24-3,CASTLE>那是他的掩护身份
<24-3,CASTLE>That's just his cover.

637
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,370
<24-4,BECKETT>你怎么知道的  就因为他这么说了吗
<24-4,BECKETT>And you know that, how? Because he told you?

638
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:02,140
<24-5,CASTLE>还因为巴黎  更因为他是我的父亲
<24-5,CASTLE>Because of Paris. And because he's my father.

639
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,620
<24-6,BECKETT>他不是你父亲
<24-6,BECKETT>He is not your father.

640
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:06,070
<24-6,BECKETT>他很久以前就做出选择了
<24-6,BECKETT>He made that choice a long time ago.

641
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:08,200
<24-6,BECKETT>现在这个人是我的嫌疑犯
<24-6,BECKETT>This man is my suspect.

642
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:10,460
<24-6,BECKETT>你知道我该怎么做  是吗
<24-6,BECKETT>Now you know what I have to do, right?

643
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:14,070
<24-7,CROSS>乖乖  她可真是个暴脾气
<24-7,CROSS>Boy, she is a spitfire, this one.

644
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,320
<24-8,CROSS>很高兴我们在同一战线上
<24-8,CROSS>I'm glad we're on the same side.

645
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:19,280
<24-9,BECKETT>谁说我们在同一战线
<24-9,BECKETT>Who says we're on the same side?

646
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:21,110
<24-10,MARTHA>不好意思  他不愿意躺着不动
<24-10,MARTHA>I'm sorry. He wouldn't stay put.

647
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:24,360
<24-11,CROSS>-理查德  我需要你的电脑  马上  -好的
<24-11,CROSS>- Richard, I need your laptop. Now. - Right.

648
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,950
<24-12,CASTLE>不行  你现在能做的就是
<24-12,CASTLE>No. The only thing that you are getting

649
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:27,900
<24-13,BECKETT>带上手铐跟我回局里
<24-13,BECKETT>is a ride to my precinct in handcuffs.

650
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,670
<24-14,CROSS>你不能逮捕我
<24-14,CROSS>You're not gonna arrest me.

651
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,480
<24-15,BECKETT>真的吗  为什么
<24-15,BECKETT>Really? Why?

652
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,020
<24-16,CROSS>因为你想知道答案
<24-16,CROSS>Because you want answers.

653
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,970
<24-16,CROSS>如果带我走  你什么都得不到
<24-16,CROSS>And if you take me in, you're not gonna get any.

654
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:36,390
<24-16,CROSS>联邦调查局的人会插一脚  你什么都做不了
<24-16,CROSS>The feds will swoop in. You won't have anything,

655
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:38,160
<24-16,CROSS>而我将浪费宝贵的时间
<24-16,CROSS>and I'll have lost valuable time.

656
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:41,240
<24-16,CROSS>你想找出杀害泰德的人  我也想
<24-16,CROSS>You want Ted's killer? So do I.

657
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:44,080
<24-16,CROSS>现在还有很多比谋杀更重要的事情  等着去解决
<24-16,CROSS>There's a hell of a lot more at stake here than murder.

658
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:46,580
<24-17,BECKETT>那你就得告诉我是什么事情
<24-17,BECKETT>Then you're gonna have to tell me what it is.

659
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,740
<25-1,CROSS>中情局出现重大的特工背叛事件
<25-1,CROSS>There was a massive breach at the C.I.A.

660
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:55,780
<25-1,CROSS>有人黑进网络  将含有深入敌方内部特工
<25-1,CROSS>Someone hacked the files containing the identities

661
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,470
<25-1,CROSS>真实身份的资料盗走了
<25-1,CROSS>of our deep cover operatives.

662
00:26:57,810 --> 00:26:58,720
<25-2,CASTLE>你知道是谁干的吗
<25-2,CASTLE>Do you know who?

663
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,120
<25-3,CROSS>不知道  但肯定是内部高层的人
<25-3,CROSS>No. But it was an inside job at the highest level.

664
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,900
<25-3,CROSS>这也是他们找我的原因  因为我是系统外的人
<25-3,CROSS>That's why they called me. Because I'm outside.

665
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,590
<25-3,CROSS>我的任务就是找到内奸  找回文件
<25-3,CROSS>My orders were to find the mole and recover the files.

666
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:10,540
<25-4,BECKETT>这些和泰德有什么关系
<25-4,BECKETT>What does any of this have to do with Ted?

667
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:12,020
<25-5,CROSS>泰德是我的得力助手
<25-5,CROSS>Ted was one of my best guys.

668
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:14,260
<25-5,CROSS>我让他帮我找到"双子星"
<25-5,CROSS>I recruited him to help me find Gemini.

669
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:15,180
<25-6,MARTHA>"双子星"
<25-6,MARTHA>Gemini?

670
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,760
<25-7,CROSS>那个内奸的代号
<25-7,CROSS>Code name for the mole.

671
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:19,750
<25-7,CROSS>他是打算卖掉这份特工名单
<25-7,CROSS>He was planning on selling the D.C.O. lists.

672
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:20,870
<25-7,CROSS>但我们找不到他
<25-7,CROSS>But we couldn't find him.

673
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:23,550
<25-7,CROSS>如果这些文件泄露出去
<25-7,CROSS>If these files get out,

674
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:25,900
<25-7,CROSS>后果将十分严重
<25-7,CROSS>the consequences will be very real.

675
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:28,340
<25-7,CROSS>在昨天我们有了进展
<25-7,CROSS>Then yesterday we had a breakthrough.

676
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:31,080
<25-7,CROSS>泰德查出了买家的身份  发信号要见我
<25-7,CROSS>Ted identified the buyer and he signaled me to meet

677
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,230
<25-7,CROSS>以便告诉我他的发现
<25-7,CROSS>so he could tell me who it was.

678
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:34,000
<25-8,CASTLE>但是
<25-8,CASTLE>But, uh...

679
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,450
<25-8,CASTLE>但是双子星抢先到达见面地点
<25-8,CASTLE>but Gemini got there first.

680
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,900
<25-8,CASTLE>是他杀了泰德
<25-8,CASTLE>He killed Ted.

681
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:38,690
<25-9,CROSS>这下让我完全没了头绪
<25-9,CROSS>Leaving me S.O.L.,

682
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:41,880
<25-9,CROSS>直到你跟我说了伊朗里亚尔币的事
<25-9,CROSS>until you told me about the Iranian rial.

683
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,820
<25-10,BECKETT>-你把里亚尔币的事跟他说了  -我...
<25-10,BECKETT>- You--you told him about the rial?  - I...

684
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:47,260
<25-11,CROSS>泰德以此确保即便出了意外
<25-11,CROSS>Ted left that as a fail-safe message...

685
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:48,460
<25-11,CROSS>买家身份也能传递出去
<25-11,CROSS>about the buyer.

686
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,490
<25-12,CASTLE>没错  传统的谍报手段
<25-12,CASTLE>Right, it's old school spycraft.

687
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:53,370
<25-12,CASTLE>但是双子星也知道这些手段
<25-12,CASTLE>But Gemini knows all the old tricks,

688
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:56,980
<25-12,CASTLE>所以他取走硬币使你不能追查到他
<25-12,CASTLE>so he took that coin to throw you off his scent.

689
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:00,060
<25-13,CROSS>没错  我一得知伊朗人身涉其中
<25-13,CROSS>Yeah, once I found out the Iranians were involved,

690
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:02,610
<25-13,CROSS>我就回溯泰德的行踪  追查到了一间公寓
<25-13,CROSS>I traced Ted's trail back to an apartment

691
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:05,630
<25-13,CROSS>在38号东大街  伊朗外交使团驻所对面
<25-13,CROSS>on East 38th Street across from the Iranian mission.

692
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:08,000
<25-13,CROSS>不过双子星比我先到一步
<25-13,CROSS>Only Gemini got there ahead of me.

693
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,060
<25-14,CASTLE>然后他伏击了你
<25-14,CASTLE>And he ambushed you?

694
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:10,640
<25-15,CROSS>从路对面的楼顶
<25-15,CROSS>From a rooftop across the way.

695
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,260
<25-15,CROSS>我刚一开门  他就猛烈开火
<25-15,CROSS>Soon as I opened the door, all hell broke loose.

696
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,980
<25-15,CROSS>但我也不是吃素的
<25-15,CROSS>But... i'm good at hell.

697
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:19,880
<25-16,CROSS>我支撑着回到了车上  他也紧追不舍
<25-16,CROSS>I made my way back to the car, but he was right on my tail.

698
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,830
<25-16,CROSS>我不得不把车开进东河里
<25-16,CROSS>I had to drive into the east river

699
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:23,140
<25-16,CROSS>以此摆脱他的追击
<25-16,CROSS>just to get away from him.

700
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:26,630
<25-17,BECKETT>这故事的确很精彩
<25-17,BECKETT>Look, this is an incredible story,

701
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:28,990
<25-17,BECKETT>我算知道卡塞尔一脑子的点子是遗传谁了
<25-17,BECKETT>and I can see where Castle gets his talent,

702
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:31,390
<25-17,BECKETT>但这无法证明你所说的  都是真的
<25-17,BECKETT>but it doesn't mean that any of what you said is true.

703
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:32,780
<25-18,CROSS>你不信我吗
<25-18,CROSS>You don't believe me?

704
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:35,400
<25-18,CROSS>那就看看新闻吧
<25-18,CROSS>Turn on the news.

705
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:38,660
<26-1,NEWSCASTER>就在数小时前  一场高速追车大战
<26-1,NEWSCASTER>A high-speed car chase rocked the neighborhood of Murray Hill

706
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:39,910
<26-1,NEWSCASTER>震惊莫里山民众
<26-1,NEWSCASTER>just hours ago.

707
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:41,980
<26-1,NEWSCASTER>有多起报警称
<26-1,NEWSCASTER>According to multiple reports,

708
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,150
<26-1,NEWSCASTER>追车之前曾有两名身份不明男子
<26-1,NEWSCASTER>the pursuit began with gunshots

709
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:47,070
<26-1,NEWSCASTER>在38号东大街一处公寓里
<26-1,NEWSCASTER>at an apartment on east 38th street

710
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:50,740
<26-1,NEWSCASTER>卷入了一场激烈的枪战
<26-1,NEWSCASTER>where two unidentified men were involved in a gun battle.

711
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:52,460
<26-2,BECKETT>这也证明不了什么
<26-2,BECKETT>That doesn't prove anything.

713
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:58,020
<26-3,BECKETT>不管泰德这小子卷进了什么麻烦
<26-3,BECKETT>So, whatever our boy Ted was into,

714
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:00,920
<26-4,ESPOSITO>他都在忙一些谍报之类的东西
<26-4,ESPOSITO>it's all some crazy-ass spy stuff.

715
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,160
<26-5,BECKETT>你发现了什么
<26-5,BECKETT>What makes you say that?

716
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:05,620
<26-6,ESPOSITO>你听说莫里山的那场追车了吧
<26-6,ESPOSITO>Well, you heard about that car chase in Murray Hill?

717
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,410
<26-6,ESPOSITO>我们就在现场
<26-6,ESPOSITO>Well, we're at the epicenter.

718
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:10,690
<26-6,ESPOSITO>位于38号街和第三大道路口处的一间被打成筛子的公寓
<26-6,ESPOSITO>It's a shot-up apartment at 38th and 3rd.

719
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:12,130
<26-6,ESPOSITO>就是从这里开始的
<26-6,ESPOSITO>It's where it all started.

720
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,570
<26-6,ESPOSITO>根据公寓管理员的说法
<26-6,ESPOSITO>According to the super,

721
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,060
<26-6,ESPOSITO>泰德·罗林斯几周前租下了这间公寓
<26-6,ESPOSITO>Ted Rollins rented this place two weeks ago.

722
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,420
<26-7,RYAN>从现场的设备来看  他正在进行网络入侵
<26-7,RYAN>By the looks of the equipment, he was hacking.

723
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:20,070
<26-8,BECKETT>-入侵哪里  -我不知道
<26-8,BECKETT>- Hacking who? - I don't know.

724
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:22,620
<26-9,RYAN>他装备了一台挺复杂的无线网络嗅探器
<26-9,RYAN>He's got a pretty sophisticated wi-fi sniffer here.

725
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:25,840
<26-9,RYAN>所以他肯定正在截听某人的网络通信
<26-9,RYAN>So, must've been intercepting internet traffic from someone.

726
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:27,500
<26-10,CASTLE>肯定是路对面的伊朗外交使团驻所
<26-10,CASTLE>The Iranian mission across the street.

727
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:29,990
<26-11,BECKETT>泰德具体截获了什么
<26-11,BECKETT>What exactly did Ted intercept?

728
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,430
<26-11,BECKETT>不清楚
<26-11,BECKETT>I don't know.

729
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,630
<26-12,RYAN>硬盘不知被谁偷走了
<26-12,RYAN>Someone stole the hard drive.

730
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,630
<26-13,CROSS>现在能借我你的电脑用用了吧
<26-13,CROSS>Can I borrow your laptop now?

732
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:44,120
<26-13,CROSS>电话留言截存  邮件截存
<26-13,CROSS>短信截存

733
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:46,060
<27-1,CASTLE>这些是伊朗外交使团的进出通讯
<27-1,CASTLE>These are communications to and from the Iranian mission.

734
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:46,660
<27-2,CROSS>没错
<27-2,CROSS>Yep.

735
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:47,990
<27-3,BECKETT>而且违法
<27-3,BECKETT>That's incredibly illegal.

736
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:48,950
<27-2,CROSS>对头
<27-2,CROSS>Yep.

737
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,510
<27-4,CROSS>这个  泰德给这条做了标记
<27-4,CROSS>Okay, here. Ted flagged this one.

738
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:54,860
<27-4,CROSS>这是一封发给伊扎德·拉贾尼的匿名邮件
<27-4,CROSS>It's an anonymous e-mail from Izad Larjani.

739
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:57,310
<27-4,CROSS>他是伊朗情报与国家安全部的人
<27-4,CROSS>He's part of vevak-- iran's C.I.A.

740
00:29:57,550 --> 00:30:01,060
<27-5,CASTLE>"终知  来款已收  中央图书馆阅览室
<27-5,CASTLE>"F.C. Payment received. Central library reading room.

741
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:03,380
<27-5,CASTLE>明日晚五点  网络名  无鳔石首鱼"
<27-5,CASTLE>Tomorrow 5:00 p.m. network name: Kingfish."

742
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:04,290
<27-5,CASTLE>这是昨天发送的
<27-5,CASTLE>This was sent yesterday.

743
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:05,920
<27-6,CROSS>也就是说今天就要行动了
<27-6,CROSS>Which means it's going down today.

744
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,850
<27-7,BECKETT>他通过加密无线网发送潜伏人员名单的时间
<27-7,BECKETT>He's sending the D.C.O. list over a secured wi-fi connection

745
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:11,500
<27-7,BECKETT>大约在  30分钟之后
<27-7,BECKETT>in... roughly 30 minutes.

746
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,680
<27-8,CASTLE>中央图书馆是个完美的交接地点
<27-8,CASTLE>Central library's a perfect location--

747
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,520
<27-8,CASTLE>是公开场所  电脑用户众多
<27-8,CASTLE>It's public. Uh, there's lots of people on laptops.

748
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:20,220
<27-9,CROSS>双子星压根不用和买家面对面
<27-9,CROSS>Gemini never has to meet with his buyer face to face.

749
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:24,300
<27-10,CASTLE>无线信号在室内最远能辐射到二百英尺
<27-10,CASTLE>Wi-fi signals max out at about 200 feet indoors.

750
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,390
<27-10,CASTLE>他和买家必须
<27-10,CASTLE>He and the buyer will have to be

751
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:26,570
<27-10,CASTLE>同时身处图书馆之中
<27-10,CASTLE>in the building at the same time.

752
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:27,860
<27-11,MARTHA>但发生了这么多事
<27-11,MARTHA>Given everything that's happened,

753
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:30,960
<27-11,MARTHA>他为什么还要坚持完成交易
<27-11,MARTHA>why would he still go through with the exchange?

754
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,120
<27-12,CROSS>"终知"意思是"最后通知"
<27-12,CROSS>"F.C." Means "Final communication."

755
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,570
<27-12,CROSS>意味着这条信息发出后所有通讯全被切断
<27-12,CROSS>All links have been severed.

756
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:37,630
<27-12,CROSS>就算双子星想收手  他也无法通知买家
<27-12,CROSS>If Gemini pulls out, he has no way to tell his buyer.

757
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:41,130
<27-12,CROSS>所以他会不择手段完成交易
<27-12,CROSS>He will do anything in his power to make the transfer.

758
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:44,230
<27-12,CROSS>我得走了  我得去阻止他
<27-12,CROSS>I gotta go. I gotta stop this.

759
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:45,200
<27-13,MARTHA>你疯了吗
<27-13,MARTHA>Well, are you crazy?!

760
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,860
<27-13,MARTHA>我们刚从你体内取了颗子弹出来
<27-13,MARTHA>We just pulled a bullet out of you.

761
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,230
<27-13,MARTHA>就不能叫别人去吗
<27-13,MARTHA>Can't you call someone?

762
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:51,310
<27-14,CROSS>这个任务本来就不存在  我也不存在
<27-14,CROSS>This mission does not exist. I don't exist.

763
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,640
<27-14,CROSS>没有别人可以叫
<27-14,CROSS>There's no one to call.

764
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:54,230
<27-15,BECKETT>你没有后援吗
<27-15,BECKETT>Don't you have back-up?

765
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:56,920
<27-16,CROSS>我就是后援
<27-16,CROSS>I am the back-up.

766
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:59,370
<27-17,CASTLE>-你这个状况完全不  -你不明白
<27-17,CASTLE>- You're in no condition--  - you don't understand!

767
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:01,980
<27-18,CROSS>这份名单决不能泄露出去
<27-18,CROSS>This list cannot get out into the open.

768
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,620
<27-19,BECKETT>那我们去
<27-19,BECKETT>Then we'll go.

769
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,630
<27-19,BECKETT>卡塞尔说得对  你这样根本应付不来
<27-19,BECKETT>Castle's right. You are in no condition.

770
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:13,300
<27-19,BECKETT>但如果我们阻止了他  就能各得所求了
<27-19,BECKETT>And if we stop him, then we all get what we want.

771
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:23,120
<28-1,CROSS>为了协调行动  我们先过一遍计划
<28-1,CROSS>Let's run this just so we know we're all on the same page.

772
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:24,490
<28-1,CROSS>理查德  你该怎么做
<28-1,CROSS>Richard, what do you do?

773
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:27,030
<28-2,CASTLE>一旦无鳔石首鱼上线  我就登陆进去
<28-2,CASTLE>as soon as the Kingfish network goes online, I log in,

774
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:27,930
<28-2,CASTLE>下载名单
<28-2,CASTLE>I download the list.

775
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:30,970
<28-3,CROSS>-你不光登陆  还要第一个登陆  -没错
<28-3,CROSS>- You don't just log in. You gotta be first.  - Right.

776
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:32,680
<28-5,MARTHA>为什么非得要第一个
<28-5,MARTHA>Why does he have to be first?

777
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,890
<28-6,CASTLE>因为这样就能把伊朗买家阻塞住
<28-6,CASTLE>Because it locks out the Iranians

778
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,060
<28-6,CASTLE>让他无法下载名单
<28-6,CASTLE>from downloading the list.

779
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,280
<28-7,BECKETT>好  卡塞尔下载的同时
<28-7,BECKETT>Right. And while Castle's downloading,

780
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:39,260
<28-7,BECKETT>我就用我手机上的无线网分析器追踪信号
<28-7,BECKETT>I'll track the signal using the wi-fi analyzer on my phone.

781
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,410
<28-8,MARTHA>用手机就能找到间谍了吗
<28-8,MARTHA>You could find a spy on your phone?

782
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:43,390
<28-9,CASTLE>母亲  现在什么功能的应用软件都有
<28-9,CASTLE>Mother, there's an app for everything now.

783
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:44,720
<28-10,CROSS>凯特  记住
<28-10,CROSS>Now, Kate, remember,

784
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:46,800
<28-10,CROSS>如果你没有战术优势
<28-10,CROSS>if you don't have a tactical advantage,

785
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:49,130
<28-10,CROSS>多看他几眼  他是中情局的人
<28-10,CROSS>just get eyes on him. He's C.I.A.

786
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,560
<28-10,CROSS>如果你能描述他的长相  我就能找到他
<28-10,CROSS>If you can describe him, I can find him.

787
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,410
<28-11,BECKETT>好的  快5点了  我们得出发了
<28-11,BECKETT>Okay. It's almost 5:00. We should go.

788
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,670
<28-12,CROSS>理查德  这对我来说  意义很重大
<28-12,CROSS>Richard, this means a lot, kid.

789
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,180
<28-13,CASTLE>谢谢
<28-13,CASTLE>Thanks.

790
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:02,940
<28-14,BECKETT>-玛莎  我需要你...  -我明白
<28-14,BECKETT>- Martha, I'm gonna need you- - I know.

791
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,890
<28-15,MARTHA>-他哪儿都别想去  -好的
<28-15,MARTHA>- He's not going anywhere. - Okay.

792
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,220
<28-17,MARTHA>如果他俩出任何意外...
<28-17,MARTHA>If anything happens to them...

793
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,570
<28-18,CROSS>他是个聪明人
<28-18,CROSS>He's a smart kid.

794
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:14,360
<28-18,CROSS>她是个出色的警察
<28-18,CROSS>And she's good at what she does.

795
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:15,870
<28-18,CROSS>他俩不会有事的
<28-18,CROSS>No, they'll be fine.

796
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,930
<28-18,CROSS>我保证
<28-18,CROSS>I promise.

797
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:20,580
<28-19,MARTHA>抱歉  但你的保证实在没什么价值
<28-19,MARTHA>Forgive me, but your promises don't mean very much.

798
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,700
<29-1,BECKETT>双子星有可能是这里的任何一个人
<29-1,BECKETT>Gemini could be any one of these people.

799
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:36,700
<29-1,BECKETT>没错
<29-1,BECKETT>Right.

800
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:39,360
<29-2,CASTLE>搜寻无线网络
<29-2,CASTLE>Scanning for Wi-Fi signals.

803
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:44,450
<29-3,BECKET>没有叫无鳔石首鱼的
<29-3,BECKET>I don't see Kingfish.

804
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:46,600
<29-4,CASTLE>也许我们来晚了
<29-4,CASTLE>Maybe we're too late.

805
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:52,590
<30-1,CROSS>你还弹琴吗
<30-1,CROSS>You still play?

806
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:56,620
<30-2,MARTHA>不怎么弹了
<30-2,MARTHA>No, not so much anymore.

807
00:32:57,290 --> 00:32:59,060
<30-3,CROSS>真可惜  你弹琴很好听
<30-3,CROSS>A shame. You were good.

808
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:04,780
<30-4,CROSS>那真是个忘情的夜
<30-4,CROSS>That was hell of a night.

809
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:06,810
<30-5,MARTHA>是个忘情的夜
<30-5,MARTHA>Hell of a night.

846
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:59,370
<34-3,CASTLE>就像《星际迷航2: 可汗之怒》里的可汗一样
<34-3,CASTLE>Like Khan in "Star Trek II: Wrath of Khan."

847
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:02,520
<34-4,BECKETT>可汗没有意识到企业号在他下方
<34-4,BECKETT>Khan didn't realize that The Enterprise was below him.

848
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,190
<34-5,CASTLE>对  如果我们是企业号
<34-5,CASTLE>Right. So if we are The Enterprise,

<34-5,CASTLE>那代表双子星在...
<34-5,CASTLE>that means Gemini is--

00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,110
<39-3,BECKETT>卡塞尔

<39-4,CASTLE>他接了个路由器
<39-4,CASTLE>He set up some kind of a relay system.

864
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:07,950
<39-5,BECKETT>双子星可能在任何地方
<39-5,BECKETT>Gemini could be anywhere.

<39-8,CASTLE>But this is--this is not a C.I.A. list.

870
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:19,080
<39-8,CASTLE>这是...是个电话号码簿
<39-8,CASTLE>This is... this is a phone book.

874
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:26,130
<39-11,BLAINE>可不可以给我签个名
<39-11,BLAINE>Can I get an autograph?

875
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:27,770
<39-12,CASTLE>我现在没这个闲工夫
<39-12,CASTLE>Actually, this is really not a good time.

876
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:30,380
<39-13,BECKETT>你说什么呢
<39-13,BECKETT>What are you talking about?

878

00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:39,480
<39-15,BECKETT>卡塞尔  在吗
<39-15,BECKETT>Castle, are you there?

880
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:42,310
<39-16,CASTLE>你就是公园里的那个男人  对不对
<39-16,CASTLE>That was you at the park, wasn't it?

881
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:44,440
<39-16,CASTLE>假扮成流浪汉
<39-16,CASTLE>Dressed as a homeless guy?

<39-16,CASTLE>你就是双子星
<39-16,CASTLE>You're Gemini.

<39-17,BLAINE>跟我走  别弄出动静
<39-17,BLAINE>Let's go. Nice and quiet.

<40-1,BLAINE>那个派你来的男人  他是谁
<40-1,BLAINE>Man who sent you-- who is he?

885
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:11,430
<40-2,CASTLE>我不明白你在说什么
<40-2,CASTLE>Look, I don't know what you're talking about.

886
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:13,760
<40-3,BLAINE>我看到你和他在公园见面  他是中情局的吗
<40-3,BLAINE>I saw you in the park with him. Is he C.I.A.?

887
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:15,920
<40-4,CASTLE>那个电话号码簿
<40-4,CASTLE>The phone book.

888
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:18,390
<40-4,CASTLE>你知道不能发真的名单
<40-4,CASTLE>You knew not to send the real list

889
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:20,260
<40-4,CASTLE>因为你只是想把他引出来
<40-4,CASTLE>because you were trying to draw him into the open.

890
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:21,140
<40-4,CASTLE>没错
<40-4,CASTLE>That's right.

891
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,570
<40-5,BLAINE>看来他还挺聪明  派了个没价值的家伙来替死
<40-5,BLAINE>Looks like he was smart enough to send someone expendable.

892
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:26,230
<40-5,BLAINE>悬疑小说家  告诉我
<40-5,BLAINE>All right, mystery writer. Tell me a story.

895
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:30,900
<40-6,CASTLE>我为什么要告诉你
<40-6,CASTLE>Why should I tell you?

896
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,160
<40-6,CASTLE>反正横竖都是死
<40-6,CASTLE>You're just gonna kill me anyway.

897
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:35,020
<40-7,BLAINE>是啊  我可以慢慢折磨你  或者给你个痛快
<40-7,BLAINE>Yeah. But I can slow, or I can kill you fast.

898
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,040
<40-7,BLAINE>这得看你了
<40-7,BLAINE>It's up to you.

901
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:57,890
<40-10,CROSS>又不是第一次了
<40-10,CROSS>Wasn't the first time.

00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,760
<40-11,CASTLE>-我叫救护车  -别费力气了
<40-11,CASTLE>- I'll go call an ambulance.  - Don't bother.

<40-13,BLAINE>不  不  等等
<40-13,BLAINE>No! No, no, wait.

904
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,690
<40-14,CASTLE>你为什么这么做
<40-14,CASTLE>Wha--why would you do that?

905
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:10,550
<40-15,CROSS>这是个任务  我这是在完成任务
<40-15,CROSS>That was the mission. That's what I do.

906
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,510
<40-16,CASTLE>你是怎么找到我的
<40-16,CASTLE>H-how did you even find me?

00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:14,960
<40-17,CROSS>你外套左边的口袋
<40-17,CROSS>Your left coat pocket.

908
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:19,890
<40-18,CASTLE>这是什么  GPS定位器吗
<40-18,CASTLE>Wha--what is this? Some kind of G.P.S. Locator?

909
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:21,570
<40-18,CASTLE>你是怎么--
<40-18,CASTLE>How did you--

910
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:24,380
<40-18,CASTLE>那个拥抱
<40-18,CASTLE>The hug.

911
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:26,020
<40-18,CASTLE>你把这个偷偷放我身上
<40-18,CASTLE>You slipped this on me.

912
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:28,090
<40-19,CROSS>我得密切关注你的动向
<40-19,CROSS>I needed to keep tabs on you.

913
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:29,720
<40-20,CASTLE>是啊  拿我做诱饵
<40-20,CASTLE>Yeah, to use me as bait.

914
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:32,000
<40-21,CROSS>在公寓的枪战之后
<40-21,CROSS>Well, after the shoot-out at the apartment,

915
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:33,120
<40-21,CROSS>我知道自己被发现了
<40-21,CROSS>I knew I was blown.

916
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:35,710
<40-21,CROSS>但我必须找回这份名单
<40-21,CROSS>But I still had to recover this list.

917
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,380
<40-22,CASTLE>所以为了占上风
<40-22,CASTLE>So, to keep the upper hand,

918
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:39,600
<40-22,CASTLE>你让我和贝克特陷入圈套
<40-22,CASTLE>you let Beckett and me walk into a trap.

919
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,890
<40-22,CASTLE>我们可能因此被杀
<40-22,CASTLE>We could've been killed.

920
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:43,340
<40-23,CROSS>我不会让你俩出事的
<40-23,CROSS>I would never let anything happen to you two.

921
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:45,200
<40-24,CASTLE>怎么  用你保护泰德的方法保护我们吗
<40-24,CASTLE>The way you never let anything happen to Ted?

922
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:49,820
<40-25,CROSS>我这么做是有原因的  理查德
<40-25,CROSS>There are reasons I have to do what I do, Richard.

923
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:53,540
<40-25,CROSS>有一天你会明白的
<40-25,CROSS>One day you'll understand. Hmm?

924
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,560
<40-25,CROSS>去找贝克特  告诉她我们抓到凶手了
<40-25,CROSS>Now get Beckett. Let her know we have her killer.

925
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,370
<41-1,BECKETT>卡塞尔  发生什么事了
<41-1,BECKETT>Castle, what happened?

<42-1,CASTLE>一分钟之前他还在这的
<42-1,CASTLE>He was here just a minute ago.

929
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:22,290
<42-1,CASTLE>不用说他肯定会抬走尸体的
<42-1,CASTLE>Of course he took the body.

930
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,310
<42-1,CASTLE>是啊
<42-1,CASTLE>Yeah.

931
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:29,990
<42-2,BECKETT>但是留下了双子星的枪
<42-2,BECKETT>But left Gemini's weapon.

932
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:35,470
<42-2,BECKETT>那把枪和杀死泰德的那把枪弹道吻合
<42-2,BECKETT>That gun was a ballistics match to the one that killed Ted.

933
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:36,780
<43-1,RYAN>枪的注册登记名字是
<43-1,RYAN>It's registered to...

934
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:38,320
<43-1,RYAN>托尼·布莱恩
<43-1,RYAN>Tony Blaine.

935
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,450
<43-2,ESPOSITO>我们搜过了他的住所
<43-2,ESPOSITO>We searched his place.

936
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:41,910
<43-2,ESPOSITO>找到衣服上的血迹与泰德的血液匹配
<43-2,ESPOSITO>Found clothes that tested positive for Ted's blood.

937
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:43,080
<43-2,ESPOSITO>布莱恩无疑就是凶手
<43-2,ESPOSITO>Blaine's definitely our killer.

938
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,220
<43-3,BECKETT>但他是谁
<43-3,BECKETT>But who is he?

939
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,850
<43-4,ESPOSITO>他是政府智囊团的研究员
<43-4,ESPOSITO>He's a researcher at a government think tank.

940
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:48,120
<43-4,ESPOSITO>但是一个政府智囊团的研究员
<43-4,ESPOSITO>Yeah, but what a researcher at a government think tank

941
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,050
<43-5,RYAN>到底卷入了什么事  我们不得而知
<43-5,RYAN>is doing involved in all this, we have no idea.

942
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:51,580
<43-6,BECKETT>是啊  也许我们永远不会知道
<43-6,BECKETT>Yeah, we may never know.

943
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,280
<43-7,ESPOSITO>别太快下定论  我们对他发出了全境通告
<43-7,ESPOSITO>Well, hold on. We've got a B.O.L.O. out on him

944
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,760
<43-7,ESPOSITO>而且正在监视他的信用卡
<43-7,ESPOSITO>and we're monitoring his credit cards.

945
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:56,350
<43-8,RYAN>-我们会找到他的  -找到后
<43-8,RYAN>- We'll find him. - And when we do,

946
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:58,210
<43-8,RYAN>也许他能告诉我们安德森·克洛斯是谁
<43-8,RYAN>maybe he can tell us who this Anderson Cross is.

947
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,360
<43-9,BECKETT>是啊  也许吧
<43-9,BECKETT>Yeah, maybe.

948
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:02,170
<43-9,BECKETT>好的  干得好  伙计们
<43-9,BECKETT>All right, great job, guys.

00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:03,100
<43-10,ESPOSITO>谢谢
<43-10,ESPOSITO>Thanks.

950
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:08,590
<43-11,BECKETT>看来中情局
<43-11,BECKETT>Well, it looks like the C.I.A.

951
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:11,140
<43-11,BECKETT>干净利落地结束这一切
<43-11,BECKETT>wrapped all this up in a neat package.

952
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:13,570
<43-12,CASTLE>是啊  拜我老爸所为
<43-12,CASTLE>Yeah, with a bow courtesy of my father.

953
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:16,030
<43-13,BECKETT>至少杀泰德的凶手已被绳之以法
<43-13,BECKETT>At least Ted's killer was brought to justice,

954
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:18,120
<43-13,BECKETT>从某种程度上说
<43-13,BECKETT>you know, in a--in a way.

955
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:19,920
<43-13,BECKETT>布莱恩杀了泰德
<43-13,BECKETT>But Blaine killed Ted

956
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:21,670
<43-14,CASTLE>但是把他的尸体扔在科尼岛
<43-14,CASTLE>but left his body at Coney Island.

957
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:24,160
<43-14,CASTLE>是我父亲移动了尸体
<43-14,CASTLE>It was my father that moved the body.

958
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,240
<43-14,CASTLE>他本可以把尸体扔在随便哪个地方
<43-14,CASTLE>Now he could've put it anywhere,

959
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:26,390
<43-14,CASTLE>但他却把尸体抬到泰德的公寓
<43-14,CASTLE>but he took it to Ted's apartment.

960
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,480
<43-14,CASTLE>你知道为什么吗
<43-14,CASTLE>Do you know why?

961
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:31,970
<43-15,BECKETT>把他带进我们的管辖区
<43-15,BECKETT>To bring him into our jurisdiction.

962
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:33,270
<43-16,CASTLE>他想我们跟进这个案子
<43-16,CASTLE>He wanted us to catch the case

963
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:34,830
<43-16,CASTLE>这样他就可以从我这得到案子的信息
<43-16,CASTLE>so he could work me for information.

964
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:37,640
<43-17,BECKETT>也许他只是给自己找个理由
<43-17,BECKETT>Well, maybe he was just looking for a reason

965
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:40,430
<43-17,BECKETT>再见你一面  这就是他的风格
<43-17,BECKETT>to see you again, and this was his way.

966
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:44,710
<43-18,CASTLE>我一直犯糊涂  以为他就是我的家人
<43-18,CASTLE>I keep making the mistake of thinking he's family.

967
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:46,060
<43-18,CASTLE>但他不是
<43-18,CASTLE>But he's not.

968
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:50,160
<43-18,CASTLE>你才是
<43-18,CASTLE>You are.

<43-21,CASTLE>It won't be too hot. It won't be too cold.

973
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,320

00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:28,540
<44-2,MARTHA>多年来我一直在想
<44-2,MARTHA>You know, for years I wondered if your father

982
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:29,970
<44-2,MARTHA>你爸是真命天子
<44-2,MARTHA>was the one who got away.

983
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:32,070
<44-2,MARTHA>现在  我终于知道了
<44-2,MARTHA>Well, now, I finally know.

984
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:35,130
<44-3,CASTLE>他从来都不值得你浪费时间
<44-3,CASTLE>He was never worth your time.

985
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:38,570
<44-4,MARTHA>不  他值得
<44-4,MARTHA>Oh, yes, he was.

986
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:40,710
<44-4,MARTHA>我第一次见到他
<44-4,MARTHA>First time I met him,

987
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:43,650
<44-4,MARTHA>他给了我人生最好的礼物  就是你
<44-4,MARTHA>he gave me the greatest gift of my life--you.

988
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:47,510
<44-4,MARTHA>如今这么多年过去了  他又给了我另一个
<44-4,MARTHA>And now after all these years, he's given me another one.

989
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,560
<44-4,MARTHA>了结
<44-4,MARTHA>Closure.

990
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:53,870
<44-4,MARTHA>所以...  那你呢  儿子

<44-6,MARTHA>你觉得我们会再见到他吗
<44-6,MARTHA>Think we'll ever see him again?
