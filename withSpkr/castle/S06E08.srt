00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:26,300

00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:37,110
<2-6,BECKETT>你注意到当你移动时  它依然盯着你吗

36

<2-8,BECKETT>我是名警察  总是保持警觉
<2-8,BECKETT>I'm a cop. I'm always on alert.

00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:46,080
<2-8,BECKETT>我回家后只想休息
<2-8,BECKETT>When I come home, I just wanna... relax.

38
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,410
<2-8,BECKETT>不是盯着一只饥饿的狮子的眼睛入睡
<2-8,BECKETT>Not fall asleep staring into the eyes of a hungry lion

39
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:50,810
<2-8,BECKETT>它好像要扑过来似的
<2-8,BECKETT>about to pounce.

40
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,020
<2-9,CASTLE>等等
<2-9,CASTLE>Wait a minute.

42
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,610
<2-9,CASTLE>你不是让我扔了莱纳斯吧
<2-9,CASTLE>You're not asking me to get rid of Linus, are you?

43
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,350
<2-10,BECKETT>不  我只是在想
<2-10,BECKETT>No, I was-- I was just thinking

44
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,110
<2-10,BECKETT>也许你可以把画挂在别的房间里
<2-10,BECKETT>that maybe you could move it to another room.

45
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:05,690
<2-11,CASTLE>别的房间
<2-11,CASTLE>Another room?

46
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:09,850
<2-12,BECKETT>是  比如说
<2-12,BECKETT>Yeah, like, um...

47
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,710
<2-12,BECKETT>你的办公室
<2-12,BECKETT>Maybe your office.

48
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:12,920
<2-13,CASTLE>我的办公室
<2-13,CASTLE>My office?

49
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,040
<2-14,BECKETT>贝克特  好  我们马上到
<2-14,BECKETT>Beckett. Yes. Okay. We'll be right there.

50
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,150
<2-15,BECKETT>有起谋杀案
<2-15,BECKETT>There's been a murder.

51
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,540
<2-16,CASTLE>是啊  莱纳斯简直被你伤透了
<2-16,CASTLE>Yeah, of Linus' feelings.

52
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,970
<3-1,CASTLE>只不过  我是用《枪林弹雨》的第一次版税
<3-1,CASTLE>It's just, I bought Linus with my first royalty check

53
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,530
<3-1,CASTLE>买下莱纳斯的
<3-1,CASTLE>from "In a Hail of Bullets."

54
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:32,760
<3-1,CASTLE>他是我的图腾  狂暴不驯  我的卧室就是兽穴
<3-1,CASTLE>He's my totem, wild and untamed, and my bedroom is my lair.

55
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,450
<3-2,BECKETT>我懂  卡塞尔  但是
<3-2,BECKETT>I know, Castle, but, um,

56
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,120
<3-2,BECKETT>那现在是我俩的"兽穴"了吧
<3-2,BECKETT>isn't it kind of our lair now?

57
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,910
<3-3,CASTLE>但是狮子莱纳斯是我性格的一部分
<3-3,CASTLE>But Linus the lion is part of my identity.

58
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,860
<3-3,CASTLE>你不会想要剥夺我的个性吧
<3-3,CASTLE>You don't wanna strip me of my identity, do you?

59
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:42,690
<3-4,BECKETT>不  知道吗
<3-4,BECKETT>No. You know what?

60
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,190
<3-4,BECKETT>你说得对  对不起
<3-4,BECKETT>You're right. I'm sorry.

61
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,940
<3-4,BECKETT>我可以住在我家
<3-4,BECKETT>I can just stay at my own place.

62
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,920
<3-5,CASTLE>谢谢  等等  不  那不...
<3-5,CASTLE>Thanks. Wait. No. That's not...

63
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:51,450
<3-6,BECKETT>莱恩  什么情况
<3-6,BECKETT>So, Ryan, what do we got?

64
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:55,230

<3-7,KEVIN RYAN>Victim is Alice Amy Clark, 37, G.S.W. to the chest.

65
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,630
<3-7,KEVIN RYAN>泊车员一小时前发现了她
<3-7,KEVIN RYAN>Uh, parking attendant found her an hour ago.

66
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,870
<3-7,KEVIN RYAN>显然她是个心理医生
<3-7,KEVIN RYAN>Apparently, she's some kind of therapist,

67
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,220
<3-7,KEVIN RYAN>在这栋大楼里有间办公室
<3-7,KEVIN RYAN>has an office here in the building.

68
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:03,360
<3-8,CASTLE>等等  爱丽丝·克拉克
<3-8,CASTLE>Wait. Alice Clark?

69
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,410
<3-8,CASTLE>不是那个爱丽丝·克拉克吧
<3-8,CASTLE>Not the Alice Clark?

70
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,560
<3-8,CASTLE>和高富帅谈恋爱的专家
<3-8,CASTLE>Relationship guru to the rich and famous?

71
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,830
<3-8,CASTLE>《交配仪式: 恋爱实战指南》的作者
<3-8,CASTLE>Author of "Mating Rituals: A Field Guide to Relationships"?

72
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,060
<3-9,BECKETT>-你认识她吗  -只知道她名气很大
<3-9,BECKETT>- You know her? - By reputation only.

73
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:18,300
<3-10,CASTLE>她觉得  我们可以通过承认动物本性
<3-10,CASTLE>She has the idea that, uh, we can improve our relationships

74
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:20,770
<3-10,CASTLE>来改善关系
<3-10,CASTLE>by acknowledging our animal nature.

75
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:23,900
<3-10,CASTLE>比如说  保护和培养的本能
<3-10,CASTLE>Um... the instinct to protect and nurture, for example,

76
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,640
<3-10,CASTLE>就是说  提供分享自己的"巢穴"
<3-10,CASTLE>by say, offering to share one's lair.

77
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:28,620
<3-11,RYAN>说到动物本性
<3-11,RYAN>Ah, well, speaking of animal nature,

78
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,250
<3-11,RYAN>你该看看她车里的情况
<3-11,RYAN>you should see the inside of her car.

79
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:34,650
<3-13,RYAN>-天啊  -被划得乱七八糟
<3-13,RYAN>- Oh, wow. - It's been completely torn apart.

80
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,490
<3-14,LANIE PARISH>从血液溅出的情况来看
<3-14,LANIE PARISH>And from the spatter pattern, it looks like

81
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,790
<3-14,LANIE PARISH>这一切都是在她被杀后进行的
<3-14,LANIE PARISH>all of this was done after she was killed.

82
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,800
<3-15,CASTLE>所以他们杀了她  然后杀了这辆车
<3-15,CASTLE>So they killed her, then they killed her car.

83
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:42,190
<3-16,BECKETT>他们是在找东西
<3-16,BECKETT>So they were looking for something.

84
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,290
<3-17,RYAN>是啊  找的不是她的钱包  电话或者钥匙
<3-17,RYAN>Yeah, and it wasn't her wallet, phone, or keys, either.

85
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,590
<3-17,RYAN>凶手没拿走那些东西
<3-17,RYAN>Killer didn't bother with those

86
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,450
<3-17,RYAN>或是我们在她钱包里找到的一万块
<3-17,RYAN>or the 10 grand that we found inside her purse.

87
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:50,610
<3-18,CASTLE>她随身携带的钱可真多
<3-18,CASTLE>That's a lot of walking-around money,

88
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,680
<3-18,CASTLE>即使是对畅销书作者而言
<3-18,CASTLE>even for a bestselling author.

89
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,320
<3-19,BECKETT>如果他们要的不是钱
<3-19,BECKETT>So if they weren't after the money,

90
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:55,970
<3-19,BECKETT>那是什么呢
<3-19,BECKETT>what were they looking for?

91
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,420
<3-19,BECKETT>知道案发时间了吗
<3-19,BECKETT>When did this happen?

92
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:01,140
<3-20,LANIE>根据体温和尸斑
<3-20,LANIE>Based on body temp and lividity,

93
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:03,440
<3-20,LANIE>我认为是在昨晚六点到八点之间
<3-20,LANIE>I'd say between 6:00 and 8:00 last night.

94
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:06,010
<3-21,BECKETT>你看了监控录像吗
<3-21,BECKETT>Did you get a look at security cams?

95
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,580
<3-22,RYAN>车库没有监控摄像头
<3-22,RYAN>Garage doesn't have camera coverage,

96
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:08,820
<3-22,RYAN>但是大楼的其它地方有
<3-22,RYAN>but other parts of the building do.

97
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,450
<3-22,RYAN>他们正在为我们调出录像
<3-22,RYAN>They're pulling tape for us right now.

98
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:13,940
<3-23,CASTLE>有人打电话给她吗
<3-23,CASTLE>Somebody calling her?

99
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:15,730
<3-24,RYAN>不  是提醒闹钟
<3-24,RYAN>No, it's some kind of reminder alarm.

100
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,120
<3-24,RYAN>每过几分钟就响一次
<3-24,RYAN>Keeps going off every few minutes.

101
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:19,640
<4-1,KYLE>NF1945
<4-1,KYLE>"N-F-1-9-4-5."

102
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,380
<3-26,RYAN>埃斯波西托和她助理在楼上  他也许知道
<3-26,RYAN>Esposito's with her assistant upstairs. He might know.

103
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,210
<4-1,KYLE>我一点也不知道这事
<4-1,KYLE>I don't know anything about it,

104
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:29,940
<4-1,KYLE>我大概在四点半离开办公室  帮忙布置会场
<4-1,KYLE>but I left the office around 4:30 to go help set up.

105
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:32,660
<4-1,KYLE>她没出现时  我就知道出了事
<4-1,KYLE>When she didn't show, I knew something was wrong.

106
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,170
<4-2,ESPOSITO>你走后她在等谁吗
<4-2,ESPOSITO>Was she expecting anyone after you left?

107
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,000
<4-2,ESPOSITO>和谁有约吗
<4-2,ESPOSITO>Any appointments?

108
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:39,020
<4-3,KYLE>没有  实际上  她让我取消了所有昨天的约会
<4-3,KYLE>No. In fact, she had me cancel them all for yesterday.

109
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,380
<4-4,ESPOSITO>有原因吗
<4-4,ESPOSITO>Any reason?

110
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:42,890
<4-5,KYLE>我想她需要时间来为演讲做准备
<4-5,KYLE>I assume she wanted time to prep for the lecture.

111
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:44,790
<4-5,KYLE>她白天大部分时间都在办公室里
<4-5,KYLE>She spent most of the day in her office.

112
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,750
<4-5,KYLE>她只接过男友马特的电话
<4-5,KYLE>Only call she took was from her boyfriend Matt.

113
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,500
<4-6,ESPOSITO>她提到过带着什么贵重的东西吗
<4-6,ESPOSITO>Did she mention having anything of value on her?

114
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:51,550
<4-6,ESPOSITO>别人可能要找的东西
<4-6,ESPOSITO>Something that someone might have been looking for?

115
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,840
<4-7,KYLE>没有  为什么这么问
<4-7,KYLE>No. Why do you ask?

116
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,300
<5-1,ESPOSITO>整个地方被翻了个遍  就像车里一样
<5-1,ESPOSITO>The whole place was turned inside out, just like the car.

117
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,190
<5-2,BECKETT>拿走了什么
<5-2,BECKETT>And what was taken?

118
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,350
<5-3,ESPOSITO>没什么有价值的
<5-3,ESPOSITO>Nothing valuable.

119
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,100
<5-3,ESPOSITO>电脑  iPad  画作
<5-3,ESPOSITO>Computers, iPads, artwork--

120
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:09,420
<5-3,ESPOSITO>显眼的东西都还在
<5-3,ESPOSITO>all the obvious stuff was still there.

121
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,190
<5-4,CASTLE>那他们在找什么
<5-4,CASTLE>So what were they looking for?

122
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,370
<5-5,ESPOSITO>不知道  她的助理说
<5-5,ESPOSITO>I don't know. The assistant said

123
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,970
<5-5,ESPOSITO>他们翻了客户档案
<5-5,ESPOSITO>that they went through her client files.

124
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,160
<5-5,ESPOSITO>爱丽丝的客户里不乏一些大人物
<5-5,ESPOSITO>Alice counseled some serious V.I.P.S --

125
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:17,940
<5-5,ESPOSITO>总裁  政客  将军
<5-5,ESPOSITO>C.E.O.s, politicians, generals,

126
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,040
<5-5,ESPOSITO>她每次治疗都存有了详细的记录
<5-5,ESPOSITO>and she took very detailed notes of every session.

127
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:22,580
<5-6,CASTLE>世界名流最私密的隐私
<5-6,CASTLE>The most intimate details of the world's elite?

128
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,200
<5-6,CASTLE>足够作为杀人动机了
<5-6,CASTLE>People have been killed for a lot less.

129
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,630
<5-7,BECKETT>丢失什么档案了吗
<5-7,BECKETT>Are there any files missing?

130
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,530
<5-8,ESPOSITO>助理正在整理
<5-8,ESPOSITO>Well, the assistant is combing through everything now,

131
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,370
<5-8,ESPOSITO>-但得花上点时间  -好了
<5-8,ESPOSITO>- but it's gonna take some time. - All right.

132
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:32,440
<5-9,RYAN>我看了大楼的监控录像
<5-9,RYAN>So I scrubbed her building security video,

133
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:33,370
<5-9,RYAN>来看这个
<5-9,RYAN>and check this out.

134
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,650
<5-9,RYAN>这人在死亡时间区的末端
<5-9,RYAN>This guy went up to Alice's office floor

135
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,600
<5-9,RYAN>上了爱丽丝办公室那层楼
<5-9,RYAN>near the tail end of our time-of-death window,

136
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:39,530
<5-9,RYAN>昨晚就他一个人上去过
<5-9,RYAN>and he was the only person up there last night.

137
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,970
<5-10,CASTLE>也就是说只有他
<5-10,CASTLE>Which means he's the only person

138
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,990
<5-10,CASTLE>可能翻过爱丽丝的办公室
<5-10,CASTLE>who could have tossed Alice's place.

139
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,790
<5-11,ESPOSITO>看啊  他每次经过摄像头都会转头
<5-11,ESPOSITO>Check it out. He's turned away from the camera every shot.

140
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,060
<5-12,BECKETT>不让我们看到他的脸  就是他
<5-12,BECKETT>Hiding his face from us. This is our guy.

141
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,430
<5-13,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>警探  死者的男朋友来了
<5-13,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>Detective? Your victim's boyfriend is here.

142
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:55,110
<6-1,MATT>没有  从没见过他
<6-1,MATT>No. Never seen him before.

143
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:58,630
<6-2,BECKETT>你也不知道他在找什么吗
<6-2,BECKETT>And you have no idea what he might have been looking for?

144
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,100
<6-3,MATT>都怪我
<6-3,MATT>This is my fault.

145
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:04,540
<6-3,MATT>我昨晚本该去接她的
<6-3,MATT>I was supposed to pick her up last night,

146
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:06,000
<6-3,MATT>但我公事缠身
<6-3,MATT>but I got held up at work.

147
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:11,230
<6-4,BECKETT>你在哪工作
<6-4,BECKETT>Where is it that you work, exactly?

148
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,820
<6-5,MATT>我是一个国际援助非政府组织的顾问
<6-5,MATT>I'm a consultant for an international aid N.G.O.

149
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:18,790
<6-5,MATT>她一直在帮人
<6-5,MATT>All she did was help people.

150
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,310
<6-5,MATT>怎么会有人要杀她
<6-5,MATT>Why would anyone wanna kill her?

151
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:22,340
<6-6,BECKETT>你觉得她最近怎么样
<6-6,BECKETT>How did she seem to you lately?

152
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:23,470
<6-6,BECKETT>有没有任何迹象表明
<6-6,BECKETT>Was there anything to indicate

153
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,360
<6-6,BECKETT>她最近不太顺利
<6-6,BECKETT>she was having any troubles in her life?

154
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,960
<6-7,MATT>没有
<6-7,MATT>No, nothing.

155
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,630
<6-7,MATT>她挺开心的
<6-7,MATT>She seemed happy.

156
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,200
<6-8,BECKETT>那她的客户呢
<6-8,BECKETT>And how about her clients?

157
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:34,280
<6-8,BECKETT>有哪个比较棘手吗
<6-8,BECKETT>Was she having difficulty with anyone?

158
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:35,740
<6-9,MATT>有时会有
<6-9,MATT>Sometimes.

159
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:40,570
<6-9,MATT>她的客户咄咄逼人
<6-9,MATT>Uh, the people she counseled could be aggressive,

160
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,240
<6-9,MATT>十分苛求  但她就喜欢挑战
<6-9,MATT>demanding, but she liked the challenge--

161
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,750
<6-9,MATT>驯服野兽什么的
<6-9,MATT>Taming the wild beast and all that.

162
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,560
<6-10,BECKETT>有没有特别突出的人
<6-10,BECKETT>Did anyone stand out in particular?

163
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:53,500
<6-11,MATT>爱丽丝  对工作闭口不谈
<6-11,MATT>Alice was... discreet about her work.

164
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:58,760
<6-11,MATT>不过那天午餐
<6-11,MATT>Though at lunch the other day,

165
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:01,570
<6-11,MATT>她...有点心不在焉
<6-11,MATT>she... seemed a little rattled.

166
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,970
<6-11,MATT>她说接到一个愤怒的客户打来的电话
<6-11,MATT>She said she'd received a call from a pissed-off client.

167
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,080
<6-12,BECKETT>你知道是谁吗
<6-12,BECKETT>Do you know who?

168
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:10,700
<6-13,MATT>正如我所说  她闭口不谈
<6-13,MATT>Like I said, she was discreet.

169
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:13,190
<7-1,BECKETT>好吧  谢谢
<7-1,BECKETT>Okay, thanks.

170
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,860
<7-2,CASTLE>听听这个
<7-2,CASTLE>Hey, listen to this.

171
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:17,040
<7-2,CASTLE>两个物种的雄性都会明确领地
<7-2,CASTLE>"Males of both species define their territory,

172
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:20,390
<7-2,CASTLE>为表敬意  邀请雌性进入
<7-2,CASTLE>then honor the female by inviting them in."

173
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,940
<7-2,CASTLE>看见没  我为表敬意  邀请你进入我的领地
<7-2,CASTLE>See, I'm--I'm honoring you by inviting you into my territory,

174
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:26,280
<7-2,CASTLE>而莱纳斯是那领地的一部分
<7-2,CASTLE>and Linus is part of that territory.

175
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:28,620
<7-3,BECKETT>如果你想再受邀进入我的领地
<7-3,BECKETT>And if you wanna be invited into my territory again,

176
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:30,330
<7-3,BECKETT>你该再好好想想了
<7-3,BECKETT>you should probably rethink that.

177
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,250
<7-4,BECKETT>鉴证组刚查过车和办公室
<7-4,BECKETT>So C.S.U. just finished with the car and the office,

178
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:38,210
<7-4,BECKETT>没有指纹  几乎没有残留证据
<7-4,BECKETT>and they found no prints and almost no trace evidence.

179
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,490
<7-4,BECKETT>就好像
<7-4,BECKETT>It's like...

180
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,320
<7-4,BECKETT>都被人清理过了
<7-4,BECKETT>both locations have been cleaned.

181
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:43,780
<7-5,CASTLE>又清理又避开摄像头  是个职业杀手
<7-5,CASTLE>That and the cameras? This guy's a pro.

182
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,570
<7-6,BECKETT>那一个职业杀手为什么要杀害
<7-6,BECKETT>Okay, so then why would a professional assassin

183
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:49,310
<7-6,BECKETT>心理医生呢
<7-6,BECKETT>Murder a therapist?

184
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,570
<7-7,CASTLE>因为作为心理医生  她知道
<7-7,CASTLE>Because as a therapist, she'd be privy to

185
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,490
<7-7,CASTLE>客户内心最深层最阴暗的秘密
<7-7,CASTLE>her clients' deepest, darkest secrets--

186
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,850
<7-7,CASTLE>这些秘密太具爆炸性了
<7-7,CASTLE>Secrets so explosive,

187
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:57,390
<7-7,CASTLE>光是听到就得死
<7-7,CASTLE>that simply hearing them ensured her demise.

188
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,600
<7-8,BECKETT>-好吧  什么秘密呢  -核弹发射码
<7-8,BECKETT>- All right, what kind of secrets? - Well... nuclear launch codes,

189
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:01,960
<7-9,CASTLE>月球漫步是假的
<7-9,CASTLE>that the moon walk was a fake,

190
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:03,340
<7-9,CASTLE>罗斯威尔飞碟坠毁事件是真的
<7-9,CASTLE>that Roswell wasn't,

191
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,820
<7-9,CASTLE>某人低温冷藏尸体的秘密地点...
<7-9,CASTLE>secret location of the cryogenically frozen body of--

192
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:08,970
<7-10,RYAN>男朋友没问题
<7-10,RYAN>Well, um... boyfriend checks out.

193
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,990
<7-10,RYAN>打电话到他办公室  他们证实他昨晚
<7-10,RYAN>Called his office. They verified that he was working

194
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,480
<7-10,RYAN>都在工作  但爱丽丝还真是
<7-10,RYAN>all last night, but Alice definitely

195
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:15,430
<7-10,RYAN>一脚踩进了泥潭里
<7-10,RYAN>tumbled down the rabbit hole to shadyland.

196
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,510
<7-10,RYAN>她手机上的提醒
<7-10,RYAN>That alert on her phone--

197
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,570
<7-10,RYAN>NF1945是她租的
<7-10,RYAN>N-F-1-9-4-5-- it's a tail number

198
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,390
<7-11,BECKETT>私人飞机的尾号
<7-11,BECKETT>of a private jet that she chartered.

199
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,370
<7-11,BECKETT>她租了私人飞机  去哪
<7-11,BECKETT>She chartered a private jet? To where?

200
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,060
<7-12,RYAN>我联系了泰特波罗机场的机师
<7-12,RYAN>Well, I contacted the pilot out of Teterboro.

201
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,860
<7-12,RYAN>他说爱丽丝给了他五万块现金
<7-12,RYAN>He said Alice paid him 50 grand in cash

202
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,600
<7-12,RYAN>让他给飞机加满油等着
<7-12,RYAN>to be on standby with a full tank of gas,

203
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,000
<7-12,RYAN>目的地未知
<7-12,RYAN>destination unknown.

204
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,440
<7-13,CASTLE>她知道自己有麻烦了
<7-13,CASTLE>She knew she was in trouble.

205
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:33,850
<7-13,CASTLE>已经准备好要消失了
<7-13,CASTLE>She was getting ready to disappear.

206
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:37,110
<7-14,BECKETT>她是名畅销书作者  事业有成
<7-14,BECKETT>Okay, she's a bestselling author with a flourishing career.

207
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,490
<7-14,BECKETT>要是有麻烦了  为什么不
<7-14,BECKETT>If she was in trouble, why didn't she

208
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,980
<7-14,BECKETT>报警或告诉她男朋友
<7-14,BECKETT>just call the police or her boyfriend?

209
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:42,630
<7-14,BECKETT>为什么要租飞机呢
<7-14,BECKETT>Why would she charter a jet?

210
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,890
<7-15,ESPOSITO>伙计们  有发现
<7-15,ESPOSITO>Hey, guys? We got something.

211
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,330
<8-1,ESPOSITO>现场排查找到了一个卖报人
<8-1,ESPOSITO>Canvass turned up a news vendor

212
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:48,270
<8-1,ESPOSITO>看到嫌疑人离开爱丽丝的大楼
<8-1,ESPOSITO>who saw our suspect leave Alice's building

213
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,530
<8-1,ESPOSITO>开着一辆蓝色厢式货车离开了
<8-1,ESPOSITO>and drive off in a blue van.

214
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,640
<8-1,ESPOSITO>他之所以记得这个人
<8-1,ESPOSITO>But the reason he remembers our guy

215
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:52,070
<8-1,ESPOSITO>是因为他的车就停在一个女人后面
<8-1,ESPOSITO>is because his van was parked behind a woman

216
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,250
<8-1,ESPOSITO>那女人因为收到违章停车罚单在咒骂交警
<8-1,ESPOSITO>who was cursing out a parking officer for giving her a ticket.

217
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,800
<8-2,TECH AGENT TORI>幸运的是  交警的车都装有摄像头
<8-2,TECH AGENT TORI>Luckily, traffic enforcement's vehicles are mounted

218
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:59,470
<8-2,TECH AGENT TORI>能拍下停着的车辆
<8-2,TECH AGENT TORI>with cameras that snap photos of each parked car.

219
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,070
<8-2,TECH AGENT TORI>他们就是这样抓停车不缴费的
<8-2,TECH AGENT TORI>It's how they catch meter cheaters.

220
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,010
<8-2,TECH AGENT TORI>这辆是被罚车辆
<8-2,TECH AGENT TORI>Here's the ticketed car.

221
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:05,770
<8-2,TECH AGENT TORI>这辆就是谋杀嫌疑犯的蓝色厢式货车
<8-2,TECH AGENT TORI>And here's your murder suspect's blue van.

222
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:08,020

<8-3,ESPOSITO>It's registered to a Manhattan Raptor, inc.

<8-4,BECKETT>有地址吗
<8-4,BECKETT>We get an address?

224
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:17,230
<9-1,RYAN>把手举起来
<9-1,RYAN>Hands! Show me your hands!

225
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:21,650
<9-2,ESPOSITO>绕到后面去
<9-2,ESPOSITO>Go around back.

226
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,430
<9-3,RYAN>开门
<9-3,RYAN>Open up!

227

228
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,370
<9-5,RYAN>把手举起来
<9-5,RYAN>Let me see those hands!

229
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,790
<9-6,RYAN>我说了把手举起来
<9-6,RYAN>I said show me those hands!

231
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:46,970
<9-6,RYAN>怎么样
<9-6,RYAN>Well?

232
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,430
<10-1,GATES>身上和车里都没有身份证明
<10-1,GATES>He didn't have an I.D. on him or in his van,

233
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,180
<10-2,ESPOSITO>但查过他的指纹后  我们找到了有趣的匹配记录
<10-2,ESPOSITO>But we did find an interesting match on his fingerprints.

234
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,620
<10-3,GATES>他是巴莱特·霍克
<10-3,GATES>That's Barrett Hawke?

235
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:56,310
<10-4,CASTLE>巴莱特·霍克  那个传奇的清道夫
<10-4,CASTLE>Barrett hawke? As in the legendary fixer?

236
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,390
<10-4,CASTLE>他为纽约权贵们
<10-4,CASTLE>He's been sweeping the dirt of New York's rich and famous

237
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,360
<10-4,CASTLE>善后十几年了
<10-4,CASTLE>under the rug for over a decade.

238
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:04,410
<10-4,CASTLE>我没找过他  我只是...听说的
<10-4,CASTLE>Not my dirt. I just... heard.

239
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,660
<10-5,GATES>我也听说过
<10-5,GATES>I've heard, too.

240
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,260
<10-6,BECKETT>据说  他会不惜一切代价完成任务
<10-6,BECKETT>Word is, he does what it takes to get the job done.

241
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:10,350
<10-6,BECKETT>他是铜墙铁壁  从来没被攻陷过
<10-6,BECKETT>He's teflon. Nothing ever sticks.

242
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,570
<10-7,ESPOSITO>那是因为他非常小心谨慎
<10-7,ESPOSITO>That's because he's careful.

243
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,740
<10-7,ESPOSITO>他车内存储器里的资料都被清空了
<10-7,ESPOSITO>Every memory drive in his van was wiped clean.

244
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,600
<10-7,ESPOSITO>没有任何证据能把他和爱丽丝联系起来
<10-7,ESPOSITO>There's nothing to tie him back to Alice.

245
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:18,680
<10-8,BECKETT>我不管他有多小心  反正有人雇他杀了爱丽丝
<10-8,BECKETT>I don't care how careful he is, someone hired him to kill her.

246
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,560
<10-8,BECKETT>这次他别想脱身了
<10-8,BECKETT>This time he's not walking away.

247
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:24,060
<11-1,BARRETT HAWKE>抱歉  警长  但我这辈子从没见过这女人
<11-1,BARRETT HAWKE>Sorry, detective, but I've never seen this woman before in my life.

248
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:25,780
<11-2,BECKETT>即使我的同事亲眼目睹
<11-2,BECKETT>Even though my colleagues witnessed you

249
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,960
<11-2,BECKETT>你在车里将她的照片放进了碎纸机
<11-2,BECKETT>In the back of your van, shredding her photo?

250
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,790
<11-3,HAWKE>你的同事看错了
<11-3,HAWKE>Your colleagues were mistaken.

251
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,610
<11-3,HAWKE>那是个微割机
<11-3,HAWKE>But that was a micro-cut shredder,

252
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,740
<11-3,HAWKE>所以很不幸  无论怎样都死无对证了
<11-3,HAWKE>So unfortunately there's no proof either way.

253
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,030
<11-4,BECKETT>我们知道她遇害时
<11-4,BECKETT>We can place you in her office building

254
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,150
<11-4,BECKETT>你在她位于77大街的办公大楼内
<11-4,BECKETT>on 77th street at the time of her murder.

255
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,980
<11-4,BECKETT>如果你不认识她
<11-4,BECKETT>So if you didn't know Alice Clark,

256
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:43,840
<11-4,BECKETT>你去那里做什么
<11-4,BECKETT>What the hell were you doing there?

257
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:47,100
<11-5,HAWKE>我最喜欢的擦鞋师父也在那栋楼里
<11-5,HAWKE>My favorite shoeshine guy's in that building.

258
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,170
<11-6,BECKETT>是吗  九楼吗
<11-6,BECKETT>Right. On the ninth floor?

259
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,330
<11-6,BECKETT>就在她被翻过办公室的那条走廊
<11-6,BECKETT>Right down the hall from her ransacked office?

260
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,930
<11-7,HAWKE>看不清他的脸
<11-7,HAWKE>Can't really make out his face.

261
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:01,120
<11-7,HAWKE>很难判定他是谁
<11-7,HAWKE>Hard to say who that guy is.

262
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,820
<11-7,HAWKE>得了吧  探长
<11-7,HAWKE>Come on, detective.

263
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,460
<11-7,HAWKE>你到底有什么实质的证据
<11-7,HAWKE>What do you really have on me, huh?

264
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:08,840
<11-7,HAWKE>没有任何证据表明我在她办公室里
<11-7,HAWKE>There isn't a single piece of evidence I was in her office,

265
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:10,680
<11-7,HAWKE>或是证明我与她的被害有关
<11-7,HAWKE>Or that I was involved in her death.

266
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,260
<11-7,HAWKE>有指纹吗
<11-7,HAWKE>Prints?

267
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:15,450
<11-7,HAWKE>还是DNA
<11-7,HAWKE>D.N.A.?

268
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,960
<11-7,HAWKE>任何证据
<11-7,HAWKE>Anything?

269
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,230
<11-7,HAWKE>我猜也是
<11-7,HAWKE>That's what I thought.

270
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:24,640
<12-1,CASTLE>就像她说的...铜墙铁壁
<12-1,CASTLE>Just like she said... teflon.

271
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:27,980
<12-2,GATES>要拿下这家伙  唯一的办法是查出雇他的人
<12-2,GATES>The only way to nail this man is to figure out who hired him,

272
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:28,770
<12-2,GATES>要查这人
<12-2,GATES>And for that,

273
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:31,980
<12-2,GATES>我们就得弄清巴莱特·霍克要找什么
<12-2,GATES>we need to know what Barrett Hawke was sent to find.

274
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,190
<12-2,GATES>我刚查过了这里的一切
<12-2,GATES>I've been through just about everything...

275
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,690
<13-1,KYLE>她的研究笔记  她的书籍文档
<13-1,KYLE>Her research notes, her book files,

276
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,090
<13-1,KYLE>全都没有被碰过
<13-1,KYLE>Everything's intact.

277
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,450
<13-1,KYLE>我对比索引  反复查了好几次
<13-1,KYLE>I've rechecked it a couple of times against our index files,

278
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,380
<13-1,KYLE>只少了一样东西
<13-1,KYLE>and there's only one thing missing.

279
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:43,930
<13-2,ESPOSITO>是什么
<13-2,ESPOSITO>What's that?

280
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,670
<13-3,KYLE>一位客户的档案
<13-3,KYLE>A client file.

281
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,740
<13-4,RYAN>哪位客户
<13-4,RYAN>Which client?

282
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:49,280
<13-5,KYLE>安德鲁和莫妮卡·斯潘瑟
<13-5,KYLE>Andrew and Monica Spencer.

283
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:52,020
<13-6,RYAN>安德鲁·斯潘瑟  那位酒店房产大亨
<13-6,RYAN>Andrew Spencer...the hotel and real estate tycoon?

284
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,720
<13-7,ESPOSITO>会有谁想要他的档案呢
<13-7,ESPOSITO>Who would want his file?

285
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,370
<13-8,KYLE>事实上  我觉得是安德鲁·斯潘瑟想要它
<13-8,KYLE>Actually, I think Andrew Spencer wanted it.

286
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,570
<13-9,ESPOSITO>他要自己的档案干什么
<13-9,ESPOSITO>Why would he want his own file?

287
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,950
<13-9,ESPOSITO>因为...
<13-9,ESPOSITO>Because...

288
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,010
<13-10,KYLE>这事还没公开
<13-10,KYLE>Well, it's not public knowledge yet,

289
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,920
<13-10,KYLE>不过斯潘瑟夫妇在协议离婚了
<13-10,KYLE>But the Spencers are getting a divorce,

290
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,690
<13-10,KYLE>就在上周  斯潘瑟夫人的律师
<13-10,KYLE>and last week, Mrs. Spencer's attorney

291
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,020
<13-10,KYLE>传唤爱丽丝  要求将她所有的诊疗记录
<13-10,KYLE>subpoenaed Alice to turn all of her session notes

292
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,040
<13-10,KYLE>呈交给法庭
<13-10,KYLE>over to the court.

293
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:12,940
<13-11,ESPOSITO>安德鲁·斯潘瑟身家数十亿
<13-11,ESPOSITO>Andrew Spencer's worth billions.

294
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,920
<13-11,ESPOSITO>如果记录中有对他不利的信息
<13-11,ESPOSITO>If there was any compromising information in those notes,

295
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,110
<13-11,ESPOSITO>会让他付出相当可观的分手费
<13-11,ESPOSITO>It would cost him boatloads in a settlement.

296
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,890
<13-12,RYAN>等等  州法律不是规定
<13-12,RYAN>Wait. Doesn't, uh, state law protect

297
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,640
<13-12,RYAN>心理医生要保护客户的隐私吗
<13-12,RYAN>therapist/client privacy?

298
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:24,450
<13-13,KYLE>可爱丽丝并非是有正规执照的心理医生
<13-13,KYLE>Except Alice wasn't a licensed therapist.

299
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,600
<13-13,KYLE>她更像是个感情导师
<13-13,KYLE>She was more of a relationship coach.

300
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:28,370
<13-13,KYLE>当斯潘瑟先生得知
<13-13,KYLE>When Mr. Spencer found out

301
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,220
<13-13,KYLE>诊疗并不受医患保密协议保护
<13-13,KYLE>the sessions weren't privileged...

302
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,870
<13-13,KYLE>他非常生气
<13-13,KYLE>He hit the roof.

303
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,360
<13-13,KYLE>他威胁要告上法庭
<13-13,KYLE>He threatened to sue.

304
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:35,390
<13-14,ESPOSITO>看来他不只是要告上法庭啊
<13-14,ESPOSITO>Well, looks like he did more than just sue.

305
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,850
<13-15,RYAN>你知道在哪能找到他吗
<13-15,RYAN>You know where we can find him?

306
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:40,260
<14-1,RECEPTIONIST>-斯潘瑟先生稍后就来  -好的
<14-1,RECEPTIONIST>- Mr. Spencer will be right with you.  - Okay.

307
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,420
<14-3,ESPOSITO>我不得不佩服这个爱丽丝啊  哥们儿
<14-3,ESPOSITO>I gotta hand it to this Alice chick, bro.

308
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:44,850
<14-3,ESPOSITO>不管她的猴子理论是什么
<14-3,ESPOSITO>Whatever her monkey theory is

309
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,130
<14-3,ESPOSITO>还真让她在大人物中混得很开啊
<14-3,ESPOSITO>has her in with the movers and the shakers.

310
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:49,330
<14-4,RYAN>她是从真正的大猩猩那学来的
<14-4,RYAN>She learned from the real gorillas.

311
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,830
<14-4,RYAN>就像是在人类世界中跟360公斤的人合作
<14-4,RYAN>Seems to be working with the 800-pound ones in the human world.

312
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:56,470
<14-4,RYAN>她就像总裁们的狗语者一样
<14-4,RYAN>She was like the dog whisperer for C.E.O.s

313
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,090
<14-5,ESPOSITO>你真相信这些
<14-5,ESPOSITO>You really buy that?

314
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,070
<14-6,RYAN>嗯  我浏览了一下她的书
<14-6,RYAN>Uh, yeah. Skimmed through her book.

315
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,870
<14-6,RYAN>我觉得她的理论有些道理
<14-6,RYAN>I think there might be something to her theory.

316
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,080
<14-6,RYAN>比如  她说在每段感情中
<14-6,RYAN>For instance, she said that in every relationship,

317
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:06,540
<14-6,RYAN>都必须有一种男性能量
<14-6,RYAN>there needs to be a masculine energy

318
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:08,920
<14-6,RYAN>和一种女性能量  即便我跟你也一样
<14-6,RYAN>and a feminine energy, even in ours.

319
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:11,440
<14-7,ESPOSITO>反正我们都知道你是哪种力量
<14-7,ESPOSITO>Oh. Well, we know which one you are.

320
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:12,260
<14-8,RYAN>我不知道你怎么想
<14-8,RYAN>I don't know about you,

321
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:14,960
<14-8,RYAN>不过我对自己的男性力量挺自信的
<14-8,RYAN>But I'm very comfortable in my masculinity.

322
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:17,540
<14-9,ESPOSITO>你知道你穿了件毛背心吧
<14-9,ESPOSITO>You do realize you're wearing a sweater vest, right?

323
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:19,310
<14-10,ANDREW SPENCER>这最好是什么重要的事
<14-10,ANDREW SPENCER>Better be important.

324
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:22,720
<14-10,ANDREW SPENCER>我刚挂断了新加坡投资集团的电话
<14-10,ANDREW SPENCER>I just hung up on my investment group in Singapore.

325
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:24,100
<14-11,ESPOSITO>安德鲁·斯潘瑟  我是埃斯波西托警探
<14-11,ESPOSITO>Andrew Spencer, detective Esposito...

326
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:26,310
<14-12,SPENCER>我他妈才不在乎你们是谁  你们想干嘛
<14-12,SPENCER>I don't give a rat's ass who you are. What do you want?

327
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,070
<14-13,ESPOSITO>爱丽丝·克拉克  你知道她吗
<14-13,ESPOSITO>Alice Clark. You know her?

328
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,050
<14-14,SPENCER>知道  怎么了
<14-14,SPENCER>Yeah, I know her. Why?

329
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,570
<14-15,RYAN>她有一份客户档案
<14-15,RYAN>Well, she had a client file

330
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:37,120
<14-15,RYAN>是你和即将成为你前妻的莫妮卡的
<14-15,RYAN>Of you and your soon-to-be ex-wife Monica...

331
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:38,470
<14-15,RYAN>这份档案现在丢失了
<14-15,RYAN>A file that's currently missing.

332
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,310
<14-16,SPENCER>我懂了
<14-16,SPENCER>Oh, I get it.

333
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,810
<14-16,SPENCER>是我老婆的律师让你们来的吗
<14-16,SPENCER>Did my wife's attorney put you up to this?

334
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,180
<14-16,SPENCER>你们知道这是什么行为吗
<14-16,SPENCER>You know what this is?

335
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:44,030
<14-17,RYAN>-这是骚扰  -不  斯潘瑟先生
<14-17,RYAN>- This is harassment.  - No, mr. Spencer.

336
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,940
<14-17,RYAN>这是一次凶案调查
<14-17,RYAN>This is a murder investigation.

337
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,630
<14-18,SPENCER>凶案调查  谁死了
<14-18,SPENCER>A murder investigation? But who's dead?

338
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,800
<14-19,RYAN>爱丽丝
<14-19,RYAN>Alice.

339
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,210
<14-20,SPENCER>她死了
<14-20,SPENCER>Alice is dead?

340
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,630
<14-21,ESPOSITO>得了吧  斯潘瑟
<14-21,ESPOSITO>Oh, come on, Spencer.

341
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,950
<14-21,ESPOSITO>别装了  我们知道你雇了巴莱特·霍克
<14-21,ESPOSITO>Drop the act. We know you hired Barrett Hawke...

342
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,260
<14-21,ESPOSITO>去杀她并拿走那份档案
<14-21,ESPOSITO>to kill her and take the files.

343
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,330
<14-22,RYAN>我们已将他和谋杀联系起来了
<14-22,RYAN>We've already linked him to her murder.

344
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:03,950
<14-23,SPENCER>不  等等  那和我没关系
<14-23,SPENCER>No. Wait, wait, wait, wait. That had nothing to do with me.

345
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:06,410
<14-23,SPENCER>听着  我是听说过霍克
<14-23,SPENCER>Look, I've heard of Hawke,

346
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,660
<14-23,SPENCER>可我从没雇佣过他
<14-23,SPENCER>but I've never used his services.

347
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:09,340
<14-23,SPENCER>我甚至不知道怎么联系他  没错
<14-23,SPENCER>Hell, I wouldn't even know how to find the guy, and, yes,

348
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:11,980
<14-23,SPENCER>我是想要自己的档案  可爱丽丝给我了
<14-23,SPENCER>I wanted my file, but Alice gave it to me.

349
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:13,920
<14-23,SPENCER>她自己送给我的
<14-23,SPENCER>She brought it to me herself.

350
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:15,280
<14-23,SPENCER>我有目击证人
<14-23,SPENCER>I-I have witnesses.

351
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:16,620
<14-24,RYAN>爱丽丝为什么要给你
<14-24,RYAN>Why would Alice give it to you?

352
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,360
<14-25,SPENCER>我提醒我太太那些心理咨询记录
<14-25,SPENCER>I reminded my wife that those sessions

353
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:19,650
<14-25,SPENCER>含有大量
<14-25,SPENCER>contained plenty of statements

354
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,470
<14-25,SPENCER>她也不想交给政府机构备案的内容
<14-25,SPENCER>that she wouldn't want on the public record either.

355
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,910
<14-25,SPENCER>她同意我的观点  我们就都联系了爱丽丝
<14-25,SPENCER>She agreed, and we both called Alice.

356
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,210
<14-25,SPENCER>爱丽丝理解我们需要保留隐私
<14-25,SPENCER>Alice understood our need for privacy,

357
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,780
<14-25,SPENCER>所以她主动交给我们  用来换取我们的帮忙
<14-25,SPENCER>so she offered to turn it over in exchange for a favor.

358
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:29,440
<14-26,ESPOSITO>是吗  帮什么忙
<14-26,ESPOSITO>Yeah? What kind of favor?

359
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:30,910
<14-27,SPENCER>说来奇怪
<14-27,SPENCER>Uh, it's actually strange.

360
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,110
<14-27,SPENCER>她想要在我的宾馆要间房间
<14-27,SPENCER>She said she needed a room in one of my hotels

361
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,470
<14-27,SPENCER>住上几天
<14-27,SPENCER>for a couple days,

362
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:36,980
<14-27,SPENCER>我必须保证没有记录显示
<14-27,SPENCER>and I had to promise that there'd be no record

363
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:38,370
<14-27,SPENCER>她住在那里
<14-27,SPENCER>that she was ever there.

364
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:44,130
<15-1,CASTLE>爱丽丝破费五万包了辆飞机
<15-1,CASTLE>Alice dropped 50 grand to charter a plane,

365
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:46,580
<15-1,CASTLE>还需要斯潘瑟给她安排个房间
<15-1,CASTLE>yet she needed Spencer to comp a hotel room for her?

366
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:48,680
<15-2,BECKETT>那是因为和金钱无关
<15-2,BECKETT>That's because it wasn't about the money.

367
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:50,760
<15-2,BECKETT>重要的是隐姓埋名
<15-2,BECKETT>It was about the anonymity.

368
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:52,960
<15-2,BECKETT>她还告诉前台  她不想要
<15-2,BECKETT>She even told the front desk that she didn't want

369
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:54,900
<15-2,BECKETT>客房服务
<15-2,BECKETT>housekeeping in her room,

370
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:57,290
<15-2,BECKETT>她也没把行踪告诉她男友
<15-2,BECKETT>and she didn't tell her boyfriend where she was.

371
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,100
<15-3,CASTLE>她并不需要客房服务
<15-3,CASTLE>Not that she would need housekeeping.

372
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:00,830
<15-3,CASTLE>这里没有行李  浴室里什么都没有
<15-3,CASTLE>There's no luggage here, nothing in the bathroom.

373
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,480
<15-3,CASTLE>好像她从没来过这里
<15-3,CASTLE>It's like she was never even here.

374
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,230
<15-4,BECKETT>可她昨天上午登记入住了
<15-4,BECKETT>Yeah, but she checked in yesterday morning.

375
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,080
<15-4,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<15-4,BECKETT>Castle?

376
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,210
<15-4,BECKETT>这里说不定是安全屋呢
<15-4,BECKETT>What if this was a safe house?

377
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:17,570
<15-4,BECKETT>说不定她知道霍克会来找她
<15-4,BECKETT>What if she knew that Hawke was coming after her?

378
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:20,200
<15-4,BECKETT>然后她决定藏在这里
<15-4,BECKETT>And she decided to hide out here

379
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,580
<15-4,BECKETT>直到她能逃到境外
<15-4,BECKETT>until she could flee the country.

380
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:26,810
<15-5,CASTLE>让飞机待命  她在等什么
<15-5,CASTLE>With a plane standing by? What was she waiting for?

381
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,450
<15-5,CASTLE>不不不  这里一定有蹊跷
<15-5,CASTLE>No, no, no, no. Something is going on here.

382
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,710
<15-5,CASTLE>她要这间房间是因为
<15-5,CASTLE>The reason why she got this room--

383
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,180
<15-5,CASTLE>她不想让任何人知道
<15-5,CASTLE>She didn't want anybody to know about it.

384
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:38,010
<15-6,CASTLE>保险箱上锁了
<15-6,CASTLE>The safe is locked.

385
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:41,090
<15-6,CASTLE>她用它来藏东西  来看看
<15-6,CASTLE>She got it to hide something. Come take a look.

386
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:45,100
<15-6,CASTLE>我打赌不管霍克找的是什么  都在这里面
<15-6,CASTLE>I bet whatever Hawke was after, it's in there--

387
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,770
<15-6,CASTLE>她知道这里会安全
<15-6,CASTLE>A place she knew it'd be safe,

388
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,430
<15-6,CASTLE>也知道没人会想到要找它
<15-6,CASTLE>and knew no one would think to look for it.

389
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,200
<15-7,BECKETT>所以说东西还在里面
<15-7,BECKETT>Which means it's still in there.

390
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:52,350
<15-7,BECKETT>有没有置换码
<15-7,BECKETT>Is there an override code?

391
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,840
<15-8,CASTLE>她就是因为里面藏的东西被杀的
<15-8,CASTLE>Whatever's in there is the reason why she was killed.

392
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,740
<15-9,CASTLE>谢谢
<15-9,CASTLE>Thank you.

393
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:23,450
<15-10,BECKETT>卡塞尔  这一定值好几百万
<15-10,BECKETT>Castle, this must be worth millions.

394
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:26,520
<15-11,CASTLE>好几千万呢
<15-11,CASTLE>Tens of millions.

395
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,740
<15-11,CASTLE>看来钻石的确是女孩最好的朋友
<15-11,CASTLE>Looks like diamonds were our girl's best friend.

396
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:38,910
<16-1,GATES>我还从没在博物馆以外的地方见过这样的钻石
<16-1,GATES>I've never seen anything like this outside of a museum.

397
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:40,570
<16-1,GATES>你确定这是真品吗
<16-1,GATES>Are you sure it's real?

398
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,770
<16-2,BECKETT>我们在回来的路上
<16-2,BECKETT>We stopped at a jewelers

399
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:44,570
<16-2,BECKETT>去了家珠宝店  珠宝匠激动得快发心脏病了
<16-2,BECKETT>on the way back, and he almost had a heart attack.

400
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:47,500
<16-3,GATES>这一定就是霍克在找的  可...
<16-3,GATES>It has to be what Hawke was after, but...

401
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,740
<16-3,GATES>爱丽丝拿它做什么呢
<16-3,GATES>What was Alice doing with it?

402
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,250
<16-4,CASTLE>考虑到现金  宾馆房间和私人飞机
<16-4,CASTLE>Given the cash, the hotel room, and the private plane,

403
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,610
<16-4,CASTLE>我觉得她在设法逃走
<16-4,CASTLE>I'd say she was making a getaway.

404
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:54,890
<16-5,GATES>你是说这是她偷的
<16-5,GATES>Are you saying she stole it?

405
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,590
<16-5,GATES>一个受名流客户青睐的心理医生
<16-5,GATES>A trusted therapist to "A"-list clientele--

406
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,010
<16-5,GATES>打入内部是再容易不过的了
<16-5,GATES>She was in the perfect position to work her way inside.

407
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:03,430
<16-5,GATES>她是《十一罗汉》  减去十个
<16-5,GATES>She's "Ocean's Eleven," minus ten.

408
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,270
<16-5,GATES>她是《独行罗汉》
<16-5,GATES>She's... "Ocean's One."

409
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,490
<16-6,BECKETT>或者是《没有罗汉》
<16-6,BECKETT>Or maybe it's "Ocean's None."

410
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,390
<16-6,BECKETT>我是说  爱丽丝事业有成
<16-6,BECKETT>I mean, Alice was successful.

411
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,610
<16-6,BECKETT>受人尊敬  在业内首屈一指
<16-6,BECKETT>Well, she's respected. She's at the top of her game.

412
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:14,220
<16-6,BECKETT>她何必冒着生命危险偷钻石呢
<16-6,BECKETT>Why would she risk it all by stealing a diamond?

413
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:16,150
<16-7,RYAN>这又产生了另一个问题
<16-7,RYAN>Which brings up another problem.

414
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,170
<16-7,RYAN>我问了劫案组和联调局
<16-7,RYAN>I spoke to the boys in robbery and at the F.B.I.

415
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:21,990
<16-7,RYAN>没人报告这样的钻石失窃
<16-7,RYAN>No one has reported a diamond like this stolen,

416
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,430
<16-7,RYAN>不只是最近没有  从来没有
<16-7,RYAN>not just recently. Ever.

417
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,360
<16-8,GATES>-那这是哪里来的  -如果这是偷来的
<16-8,GATES>- Then where did it come from? - And if it was stolen,

418
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:28,980
<16-9,BECKETT>为什么失主没有报案
<16-9,BECKETT>why haven't the owners reported it?

419
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:32,300
<16-10,CASTLE>说不定是因为失主不能报案
<16-10,CASTLE>What if it's because they couldn't afford to?

420
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:34,730
<16-10,CASTLE>因为这钻石来历不明
<16-10,CASTLE>Because the diamond has some kind of sordid past.

421
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,340
<16-10,CASTLE>或许像是希望之星  受了诅咒
<16-10,CASTLE>Perhaps it's like the Hope Diamond. It's cursed.

422
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:39,370
<16-10,CASTLE>又或许这是颗充满强大能量的魔力宝石
<16-10,CASTLE>Or maybe it's a-- an occult gem of great power,

423
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,510
<16-10,CASTLE>在纳粹德国时期被偷运出去
<16-10,CASTLE>smuggled out of Nazi Germany,

424
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,500
<16-11,GATES>-被...  -谢谢  卡塞尔先生
<16-11,GATES>- shoved up some... - Thank you, Mr. Castle.

425
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:43,910
<16-12,BECKETT>有人知道它的来历
<16-12,BECKETT>Someone knows where it came from.

426
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:47,230
<16-12,BECKETT>有人派巴莱特·霍克找爱丽丝得到它
<16-12,BECKETT>Someone sent Barrett Hawke after Alice to get it.

427
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,240
<16-13,CASTLE>或许这颗钻石能告诉我们
<16-13,CASTLE>Maybe the diamond could tell us.

428
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,480
<16-14,GATES>什么意思
<16-14,GATES>What do you mean?

429
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:53,280
<16-15,CASTLE>你自己也说了
<16-15,CASTLE>Well, you said it yourself.

430
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,960
<16-15,CASTLE>你从没在博物馆以外见过这样的钻石
<16-15,CASTLE>You've never seen anything like this outside of a museum.

431
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:59,520
<16-15,CASTLE>这么大的钻石是有名气的  他们有名字
<16-15,CASTLE>Diamonds this big are famous. They have names--

432
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:01,730
<16-15,CASTLE>阿克巴沙赫  阿格拉之星
<16-15,CASTLE>The Akbar Shah, the Angola star,

433
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,870
<16-15,CASTLE>艾克沙修
<16-15,CASTLE>the, um... Excelsior.

434
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,060
<16-15,CASTLE>这颗钻石也一定有故事
<16-15,CASTLE>Now this diamond has a story.

435
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,520
<16-15,CASTLE>如果我们能查明它的故事
<16-15,CASTLE>If we can figure out what that story is,

436
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:11,250
<16-15,CASTLE>它可能会指引我们找到凶手
<16-15,CASTLE>it might just give us a path to our killer.

437
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,200
<16-15,CASTLE>对  卡塞尔说得对
<16-15,CASTLE>Yeah, Castle's right.

438
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:15,490
<16-16,BECKETT>纽约是美国钻石交易的中心
<16-16,BECKETT>This city is the hub of the nation's diamond trade.

439
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,340
<16-16,BECKETT>这里一定有专家
<16-16,BECKETT>There has to be an expert out there

440
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,450
<16-16,BECKETT>能告诉我们这颗钻石的来历
<16-16,BECKETT>that can tell us where it came from.

441
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:23,560
<17-1,EDWARD PETERS>尤物
<17-1,EDWARD PETERS>Such beauty.

442
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:25,300
<17-1,EDWARD PETERS>太耀眼了
<17-1,EDWARD PETERS>It's absolutely stunning.

443
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,590
<17-2,ESPOSITO>能说出它的来历吗
<17-2,ESPOSITO>Can you tell where it came from?

444
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,170
<17-3,PETERS>钻石不是人  警探
<17-3,PETERS>Diamonds are not people, detective.

445
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,710
<17-3,PETERS>在亚洲开采的钻石
<17-3,PETERS>A diamond mined in Asia looks the same

446
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,530
<17-3,PETERS>和非洲开采的钻石一个样
<17-3,PETERS>as a diamond mined in Africa.

447
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,980
<17-3,PETERS>但是  美国没有矿山
<17-3,PETERS>However, there are no mines in America,

448
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:35,140
<17-3,PETERS>所以不是美国开采的
<17-3,PETERS>so, uh, it is not from here.

449
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:36,530
<17-4,RYAN>我搭档的意思是
<17-4,RYAN>Uh, what my partner means is

450
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,770
<17-4,RYAN>你以前见过这颗钻石吗
<17-4,RYAN>have you come across this stone before?

451
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,750
<17-5,PETERS>从没见过
<17-5,PETERS>Ah. Never.

452
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:43,130
<17-5,PETERS>作为美国宝石基金会的主席
<17-5,PETERS>And as head of the American gemological foundation,

453
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:45,640
<17-5,PETERS>我知道地球上每颗特别的宝石
<17-5,PETERS>I know every extraordinary stone on the planet.

454
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:48,420
<17-6,ESPOSITO>-那你不知道钻石的主人是谁  -不知道  我应该知道的
<17-6,ESPOSITO>- So you don't know who owns it? - No, and I should.

455
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,160
<17-7,PETERS>我是说  发现一块
<17-7,PETERS>I mean, a discovery

456
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,440
<17-7,PETERS>这样不可思议的宝石是要上头条的
<17-7,PETERS>of an incredible gem like this is headline-making.

457
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:52,470
<17-7,PETERS>应该很出名才对
<17-7,PETERS>They become famous.

458
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,030
<17-8,RYAN>-可能是最近进口的吗  -不
<17-8,RYAN>- Uh, could it be a recent import? - No.

459
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:57,350
<17-9,PETERS>我看过所有经过海关的宝石报告
<17-9,PETERS>I'm copied on gem reports that pass through customs,

460
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,140
<17-9,PETERS>在我在美国珠宝基金会的这些年里
<17-9,PETERS>and nothing remotely this size has come through

461
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:01,530
<17-9,PETERS>从来没有这种尺寸的宝石
<17-9,PETERS>in my entire tenure at the A.G.F.

462
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:05,380
<17-9,PETERS>这块石头的来源完全是个谜
<17-9,PETERS>No, the origins of this stone are a complete mystery.

463
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:07,310
<17-9,PETERS>你们能告诉我你们是怎么得到它的吗
<17-9,PETERS>Can you tell me how you came to possess it?

464
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,760
<17-10,ESPOSITO>这是一项正在进行中的调查的证物
<17-10,ESPOSITO>It's evidence in an ongoing investigation, so...

465
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:12,570
<17-11,RYAN>关于它你能告诉我们什么
<17-11,RYAN>What can you tell us about this diamond?

466
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:15,840
<17-12,PETERS>我可以做一些额外的光谱分析
<17-12,PETERS>Well, I should like to run additional spectrometer

467
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:17,860
<17-12,PETERS>和成像测试  但是
<17-12,PETERS>and imaging tests on it, but, uh,

468
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:20,250
<17-12,PETERS>与此同时  让我从4C测试开始
<17-12,PETERS>for the meantime, let me start with the four C's.

469
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,410
<17-13,RYAN>颜色  切割  透明度  克拉数
<17-13,RYAN>Uh, color, cut, clarity, carat.

470
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:25,210
<17-13,RYAN>如果你买过订婚戒指你会知道的
<17-13,RYAN>You'd know this if you ever bought an engagement ring.

471
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,180
<17-14,PETERS>这颗钻石是无色的
<17-14,PETERS>The diamond is colorless.

472
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:29,370
<17-14,PETERS>没有瑕疵  切割手法很质朴
<17-14,PETERS>No blemishes, so a pristine cut,

473
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:32,510
<17-14,PETERS>内部无混浊  而且...
<17-14,PETERS>No internal clouding, and, uh...

474
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:36,080
<17-14,PETERS>将近100克拉
<17-14,PETERS>nearly 100 carats.

475
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,490
<17-14,PETERS>天呐
<17-14,PETERS>Man.

476
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,850
<17-15,ESPOSITO>想要买得起那样一块钻石
<17-15,ESPOSITO>Hey, how deep would my pockets have to be

477
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,200
<17-15,ESPOSITO>我得有多少钱
<17-15,ESPOSITO>to afford a rock like that?

478
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:41,400
<17-16,PETERS>警探  那些钱摞起来
<17-16,PETERS>Detective, you are not tall enough

479
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:43,160
<17-16,PETERS>比你还要高
<17-16,PETERS>to have pockets deep enough.

480
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:45,740
<17-16,PETERS>但...  我会说它值...
<17-16,PETERS>But... I would say it's worth...

481
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:48,180
<18-2,RYAN>6000万美元
<18-2,RYAN>$60 million.

482
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,240
<17-16,PETERS>保守估计
<17-16,PETERS>Conservatively.

483
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:52,270
<17-17,ESPOSITO>对  我没那么高
<17-17,ESPOSITO>Yeah, I ain't that tall.

484
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:57,430
<18-1,GATES>六个零  后面还要再加六个零
<18-1,GATES>Six-zero? Like with another six zeroes after that?

485
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,420
<18-2,RYAN>6000万美元  对
<18-2,RYAN>That would be $60 million, yes.

486
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:00,320
<18-3,BECKETT>它有没有可能
<18-3,BECKETT>Is it possible

487
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:02,590
<18-3,BECKETT>是世代相传的传家宝
<18-3,BECKETT>it's an heirloom passed down through generations,

488
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,670
<18-3,BECKETT>所以才没有关于它的记录
<18-3,BECKETT>and that's why there's no record of it?

489
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,750
<18-4,ESPOSITO>彼得斯说老派的钻石切割者
<18-4,ESPOSITO>Nah, Peters said that old-school cutters

490
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,850
<18-4,ESPOSITO>喜欢给钻石切出锋利的边缘
<18-4,ESPOSITO>fashioned diamonds with sharp edges.

491
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:11,850
<18-4,ESPOSITO>这颗钻石边缘光滑  意味着它是在
<18-4,ESPOSITO>This one has smooth edges, which means it had to be cut

492
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:13,310
<18-4,ESPOSITO>近几十年里被切割的
<18-4,ESPOSITO>within the last few decades.

493
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,710
<18-5,RYAN>没有海关文件说明
<18-5,RYAN>No customs declaration means

494
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,680
<18-5,RYAN>它是从它被开采出的国家走私来的
<18-5,RYAN>it was smuggled in probably from the country where it was mined.

495
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,200
<18-6,GATES>我们能把爱丽丝的哪个客户和钻石
<18-6,GATES>Were we able to connect any of Alice's clients

496
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:21,230
<18-6,GATES>联系起来吗
<18-6,GATES>to the diamond?

497
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,330
<18-7,BECKETT>我们还在查  但是目前没有
<18-7,BECKETT>We're still going through them, but no, not yet.

498
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,390
<18-8,RYAN>彼得斯说他还在那颗钻石上
<18-8,RYAN>Peters said he also found

499
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,880
<18-8,RYAN>发现了一些残胶
<18-8,RYAN>some glue residue on the stone,

500
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:28,120
<18-8,RYAN>说明它曾经被装在一件首饰上
<18-8,RYAN>which suggests that it was set in a piece of jewelry.

501
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:29,350
<18-9,CASTLE>为了广大的已经订婚的男人
<18-9,CASTLE>For engaged men everywhere,

502
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,820
<18-9,CASTLE>我只能祈祷不是装在戒指上
<18-9,CASTLE>I can only hope it wasn't the ring.

503
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:33,400
<18-10,GATES>把钻石带回局里来
<18-10,GATES>Get that rock back to the precinct.

504
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:35,700
<18-10,GATES>我需要它被妥善保管并且重兵把守
<18-10,GATES>I want it under lock, key, and armed guard.

505
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:37,080
<18-11,ESPOSITO>我们马上就到
<18-11,ESPOSITO>We're on our way.

506
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,770
<18-11,ESPOSITO>那么...
<18-11,ESPOSITO>So...

507
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,990
<19-1,ESPOSITO>我们是在想同一件事吗
<19-1,ESPOSITO>Are we thinking the same thing?

508
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:44,420
<19-2,RYAN>我们没法停下来吃午餐
<19-2,RYAN>That it's a bummer we can't stop for lunch

509
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:46,650
<19-2,RYAN>因为我们拿着一颗价值6000万的钻石
<19-2,RYAN>because there's a $60 million diamond sitting between us?

510
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:50,380
<19-3,ESPOSITO>不  因为我们有一块价值6000万的钻石
<19-3,ESPOSITO>No, that because of the $60 million diamond sitting between us,

511
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:53,430
<19-3,ESPOSITO>不是真心  但有些动心
<19-3,ESPOSITO>that we are not-really- but-kinda-sorta

512
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,660
<19-3,ESPOSITO>带着它远走高飞
<19-3,ESPOSITO>thinking about making a run for the border.

513
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,890
<19-4,RYAN>我根本就没这么想过
<19-4,RYAN>That didn't even cross my mind.

514
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,860
<19-5,ESPOSITO>那是当然
<19-5,ESPOSITO>Of course it didn't.

515
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:04,060
<19-5,ESPOSITO>不  你不会得到钻石的
<19-5,ESPOSITO>Nope. You wouldn't have the stones.

516
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:06,470
<19-5,ESPOSITO>我就是说说而已
<19-5,ESPOSITO>All I'm saying.

517
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,820
<19-7,RYAN>-你还活着吗  -暂时还活着
<19-7,RYAN>- You breathing? - Yeah, for now.

518
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:13,880
<19-8,ESPOSITO>枪  把头低下
<19-8,ESPOSITO>Gun! Get down!

519
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:28,100
<20-1,RYAN>他们有三个人  那颗钻石
<20-1,RYAN>Three of them! The diamond.

520
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:30,950
<20-2,ESPOSITO>地铁站入口  七点钟方向  我掩护  快走
<20-2,ESPOSITO>Subway entrance, 7:00. I'll cover you. Go!

521
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:36,630
<20-3,RYAN>快走
<20-3,RYAN>Go!

522
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:49,680
<20-4,RYAN>-你没事吧  -没事
<20-4,RYAN>- You all right? - Yeah.

523
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:51,410
<21-1,ESPOSITO>我没事  我...
<21-1,ESPOSITO>I'm good. I'm...

524
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:54,590
<21-2,GATES>你们一到地铁站那辆SUV就开走了
<21-2,GATES>The S.U.V. took off right after you hit the subway.

525
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,420
<21-2,GATES>我们调出了交通监控  而且我们让
<21-2,GATES>We're pulling traffic footage, and we've got

526
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:58,350
<21-2,GATES>城里的每个警察都去找那辆车
<21-2,GATES>every cop in the city looking for it.

527
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,810
<21-3,BECKETT>你们说他们戴着面具
<21-3,BECKETT>And you said they were wearing masks?

528
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,330
<21-4,RYAN>对  小丑面具
<21-4,RYAN>Yeah, clown masks.

529
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:02,930
<21-5,CASTLE>就好像小丑不够吓人似的
<21-5,CASTLE>As if clowns weren't creepy enough.

530
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,830
<21-6,BECKETT>那他们的声音呢  他们说什么了吗
<21-6,BECKETT>What about their voices? Did they say anything?

531
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,290
<21-6,BECKETT>他们有口音吗
<21-6,BECKETT>Did they have accents?

532
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,450
<21-7,ESPOSITO>出声的只有他们的子弹
<21-7,ESPOSITO>Uh, they let their bullets do the talking.

533
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,210
<21-8,RYAN>警监  他们光天化日之下袭击了我们
<21-8,RYAN>Captain, they attacked us in broad daylight,

534
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,960
<21-8,RYAN>而且他们知道钻石在我们手里
<21-8,RYAN>and they knew we had the rock.

535
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,060
<21-8,RYAN>要么是巴莱特·霍克突然变换了战术
<21-8,RYAN>Now either Barrett Hawke has gone commando all of a sudden,

536
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:17,170
<21-8,RYAN>-要么就是还有别的情况  -他说得对
<21-8,RYAN>- or something else is going on here. - He's right.

537
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,330
<21-9,CASTLE>这件事开始变得比一颗钻石
<21-9,CASTLE>I mean, this is starting to sound like

538
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,700
<21-9,CASTLE>要复杂得多
<21-9,CASTLE>it's about a whole lot more than just a diamond.

539
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,090
<21-10,GATES>好吧  去清理干净
<21-10,GATES>Okay. Get cleaned up.

540
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,340
<21-10,GATES>我需要你们俩去找那辆SUV
<21-10,GATES>I need you two to go hunting for that S.U.V.

541
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:28,540
<21-10,GATES>不管发生了什么  爱丽丝都深陷其中
<21-10,GATES>Whatever's going on, Alice was in it up to her eyeballs.

542
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:31,560
<21-10,GATES>如果她的客户们跟出产钻石的国家
<21-10,GATES>If any of her clients have even the remotest connection

543
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:33,630
<21-10,GATES>有任何一点点联系
<21-10,GATES>to a country that produces diamonds,

544
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,910
<21-10,GATES>都必须让我知道
<21-10,GATES>I wanna know about it.

545
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,860
<21-11,BECKETT>-是  长官  -好吧
<21-11,BECKETT>- Yes, Sir. - All right.

546
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,020
<21-11,BECKETT>我在想...
<21-11,BECKETT>So I was thinking...

547
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:44,340
<22-1,CASTLE>当我们在一起工作时
<22-1,CASTLE>When we work a case together,

548
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:46,860
<22-1,CASTLE>你的这张桌子也可以
<22-1,CASTLE>this desk of yours is sort of

549
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:50,180
<22-1,CASTLE>算是我们的空间  而且...
<22-1,CASTLE>kind of our space, and...

550
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:54,070
<22-1,CASTLE>这些大象从第一天开始就让我
<22-1,CASTLE>These elephants on parade have creeped me out

551
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,520
<22-1,CASTLE>很不自在  所以如果我们把它们扔了
<22-1,CASTLE>since day one, so what do you say

552
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:58,330
<22-1,CASTLE>你觉得怎么样
<22-1,CASTLE>we just get rid of these?

553
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:01,140
<22-1,CASTLE>抱歉  你有什么意见吗
<22-1,CASTLE>Oh, I'm sorry. Do you have a problem with that?

554
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:02,870
<22-1,CASTLE>如果我试图把
<22-1,CASTLE>If I try to get rid of something

555
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,550
<22-1,CASTLE>对你很有意义的东西随手扔掉
<22-1,CASTLE>that obviously has deep meaning to you?

556
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:10,690
<22-2,BECKETT>如果你不喜欢它们  我也不喜欢它们
<22-2,BECKETT>If you don't like the elephants, I don't like the elephants.

557
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:17,110
<22-3,CASTLE>好吧
<22-3,CASTLE>Fine.

558
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,540
<22-3,CASTLE>我其实挺喜欢这些大象的
<22-3,CASTLE>I actually like those elephants.

559
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:21,610
<22-3,CASTLE>它们显然有家庭观念
<22-3,CASTLE>They've obviously have family values,

560
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:23,960
<22-3,CASTLE>而且这头对钱很在行
<22-3,CASTLE>and this one's good with money.

561
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:25,370
<22-3,CASTLE>总之...
<22-3,CASTLE>Anyway...

562
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:27,470
<22-3,CASTLE>爱丽丝的客户有线索吗
<22-3,CASTLE>Any luck on Alice's clients?

563
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,070
<22-4,BECKETT>有那么几个
<22-4,BECKETT>Yeah, a couple of possibilities--

564
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,210
<22-4,BECKETT>一个在南非有投资的
<22-4,BECKETT>a hedge fund manager

565
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:32,250
<22-4,BECKETT>对冲基金经理
<22-4,BECKETT>with investments in South Africa,

566
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:35,100
<22-4,BECKETT>一位与俄国有关的联合国外交官
<22-4,BECKETT>a U.N. Diplomat with ties to Russia,

567
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:37,390
<22-4,BECKETT>一家距中国矿井80英里的制造厂的
<22-4,BECKETT>and a C.E.O. with a manufacturing plant

568
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,000
<22-4,BECKETT>首席执行官
<22-4,BECKETT>80 miles from a chinese mine.

569
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:43,080
<22-5,CASTLE>或许我们找错了方向
<22-5,CASTLE>What if we're looking at this wrong?

570
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:44,960
<22-5,CASTLE>或许问题的关键不是爱丽丝的客户
<22-5,CASTLE>What if it's not about Alice's clients,

571
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:46,730
<22-5,CASTLE>而是爱丽丝本身
<22-5,CASTLE>but it's actually about Alice?

572
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,240
<22-6,BECKETT>-你的意思是  -当她在非洲
<22-6,BECKETT>- What do you mean? - When she was living

573
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:50,970
<22-7,CASTLE>与大猩猩一起生活时  她就在卢旺达
<22-7,CASTLE>with the gorillas in Africa, that was in Rwanda,

574
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,310
<22-7,CASTLE>正好毗邻刚果
<22-7,CASTLE>right along the border of the Congo--

575
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,430
<22-7,CASTLE>这一以冲突钻石闻名的国家
<22-7,CASTLE>A region known for conflict diamonds.

576
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,560
<22-8,BECKETT>你认为她卷入了血钻交易吗
<22-8,BECKETT>So you think she was involved in the blood diamond trade?

577
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:59,210
<22-9,CASTLE>我想这事已经不言自明了
<22-9,CASTLE>I think it's a story that writes itself.

578
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,240
<22-9,CASTLE>一位年轻的灵长类动物学家
<22-9,CASTLE>A young primatologist

579
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:03,020
<22-9,CASTLE>在一片不稳定地区爱上了
<22-9,CASTLE>In an unstable region falls for

580
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:06,100
<22-9,CASTLE>另一种大猩猩  一名军阀
<22-9,CASTLE>a different kind of gorilla--a warlord

581
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:10,140
<22-9,CASTLE>用血钻来筹集军资
<22-9,CASTLE>who is funding his bloody agenda with diamonds.

582
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:12,140
<22-9,CASTLE>他送给她一颗作为礼物
<22-9,CASTLE>He gives her one as a gift.

583
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,720
<22-9,CASTLE>不不  倒回去
<22-9,CASTLE>No. No, go back.

584
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:18,000
<22-9,CASTLE>她没那么爱他  钻石是她偷来的
<22-9,CASTLE>She's not that into him, and she steals the diamond,

585
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:20,690
<22-9,CASTLE>却不知道它的真正价值
<22-9,CASTLE>having no idea its real value.

586
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,750
<22-9,CASTLE>她把它偷运回美国  却发现
<22-9,CASTLE>She smuggles it back to the United States and finds

587
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,060
<22-9,CASTLE>无法无声无息地把它出手
<22-9,CASTLE>she can't sell it without attracting too much attention,

588
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:27,640
<22-9,CASTLE>所以她把它藏了起来  直到有一天
<22-9,CASTLE>so she hides it until one day

589
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:31,740
<22-9,CASTLE>一名被甩而又博览群书的军阀
<22-9,CASTLE>A jilted and well-read warlord finds a book

590
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,900
<22-9,CASTLE>在一本书的背面看到了她的照片
<22-9,CASTLE>and sees her photo on the back.

591
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:35,760
<22-9,CASTLE>意识到她偷了自己的钻石
<22-9,CASTLE>Knowing what she stole,

592
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:37,550
<22-9,CASTLE>他来找她了
<22-9,CASTLE>he comes after her.

593
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,680
<22-10,BECKETT>这还  真像那么回事
<22-10,BECKETT>That is... surprisingly plausible.

594
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:46,080
<22-11,CASTLE>我也觉得  对吧  这实际上
<22-11,CASTLE>I know, right? It's actually...

595
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:47,980
<22-11,CASTLE>这实际上解释了很多事
<22-11,CASTLE>That would actually explain a lot--

596
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:49,830
<22-11,CASTLE>为什么她要计划消失
<22-11,CASTLE>Why she was planning to disappear,

597
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,080
<22-11,CASTLE>为什么埃斯波西托和莱恩
<22-11,CASTLE>why Esposito and Ryan

598
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:52,230
<22-11,CASTLE>会在光天化日之下被枪击
<22-11,CASTLE>were shot at in broad daylight.

599
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,790
<22-11,CASTLE>这还真是个完美的猜想
<22-11,CASTLE>That's actually a perfect theory.

600
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,760
<22-12,BECKETT>也许吧  卡塞尔  但你知道吗
<22-12,BECKETT>Maybe, Castle, but you know what?

601
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:56,560
<22-12,BECKETT>我也许有个更好的
<22-12,BECKETT>I might have... a better one.

602
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:58,370
<22-12,BECKETT>关于史蒂夫·沃纳你了解多少
<22-12,BECKETT>What do you know about Steve Warner?

603
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:00,750
<22-13,CASTLE>-科技企业家  -没错  显而易见的
<22-13,CASTLE>- Uh, tech entrepreneur? -Yeah. Apparently,

604
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,910
<22-14,BECKETT>他和他的妻子是爱丽丝的客户
<22-14,BECKETT>he and his wife were Alice's clients.

605
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,390
<22-15,CASTLE>然后呢  他们与钻石生产国
<22-15,CASTLE>And what, they had business contacts

606
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,050
<22-15,CASTLE>-有商业关系吗  -没有
<22-15,CASTLE>- in diamond-producing countries? - No.

607
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:08,810
<22-16,BECKETT>但他们的慈善基金有
<22-16,BECKETT>But their charitable foundation does--

608
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,620
<22-16,BECKETT>主要是在非洲
<22-16,BECKETT>Primarily in Africa,

609
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:14,680
<22-16,BECKETT>向发展中和饱受战火荼毒的国家运送疫苗
<22-16,BECKETT>delivering immunizations to developing and war-torn countries.

610
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:17,610
<22-17,CASTLE>但你的大慈大悲慈善家故事
<22-17,CASTLE>Okay. But what makes your heroic philanthropist story

611
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,230
<22-17,CASTLE>哪里比我的疯狂军阀故事更好呢
<22-17,CASTLE>better than my crazed warlord story?

612
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,560
<14-16,SPENCER>这个
<14-16,SPENCER>This.

613
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,730
<22-17,CASTLE>这是沃纳夫妇
<22-17,CASTLE>That's Steve and Janet Warner

614
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,900
<22-18,BECKETT>两个月前在国际特赦组织义卖上拍摄的
<22-18,BECKETT>at the amnesty global benefit two nights ago.

615
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:27,110
<22-18,BECKETT>珍妮特是他们的董事会成员
<22-18,BECKETT>Janet's on their board.

616
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:32,400
<22-19,CASTLE>-认出什么没有  -你好啊  尤物
<22-19,CASTLE>- You recognize anything? - Hello, gorgeous.

617
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:34,830
<23-1,BECKETT>沃纳先生以及夫人
<23-1,BECKETT>Mr. And mrs. Warner,

618
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,470
<23-1,BECKETT>-非常感谢你们能来  -没什么
<23-1,BECKETT>- Thank you so much for coming. - Of course.

619
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,760
<23-2,STEVE WARNER>当得知她的死讯时  我们都震惊无比
<23-2,STEVE WARNER>We can't tell you how shocked we were to hear about Alice.

620
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:42,590
<23-3,CASTLE>你们成为她的客户多久了
<23-3,CASTLE>How long had the two of you been her clients?

621
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,460
<23-4,STEVE>有几年了
<23-4,STEVE>A couple of years.

622
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:44,940
<23-5,JANET WARNER>她挽救了我们的婚姻
<23-5,JANET WARNER>She saved our marriage.

623
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:46,540
<23-5,JANET WARNER>做一对成功人士夫妻很不容易
<23-5,JANET WARNER>Being a power couple isn't easy.

624
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:48,260
<23-5,JANET WARNER>爱丽丝理解这一点
<23-5,JANET WARNER>Alice understood that.

625
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:50,760
<23-6,BECKETT>只是好奇  两位与爱丽丝见面时
<23-6,BECKETT>Just curious--when the two of you would meet with Alice,

626
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:53,660
<23-6,BECKETT>你们去她办公室  还是她来你们家
<23-6,BECKETT>would you go to her office, or would she come to your home?

627
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:54,640
<23-7,JANET>都有  为什么这么问
<23-7,JANET>Both. Why?

628
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:57,150
<23-8,CASTLE>她能自由出入你们家吗
<23-8,CASTLE>Did she ever have access to your place?

629
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,190
<23-8,CASTLE>你们给过她钥匙或安全密码吗
<23-8,CASTLE>Did you ever give her keys or security codes?

630
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,710
<23-9,STEVE>没有  我们怎么会  为什么这么问
<23-9,STEVE>No. Why would we? What's this all about?

631
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,540
<23-10,BECKETT>我们相信她被谋杀与一起盗窃案有关
<23-10,BECKETT>We believe her murder is connected to a theft.

632
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:07,950
<23-11,STEVE>一起盗窃案
<23-11,STEVE>A theft?

633
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:10,380
<23-12,BECKETT>是的  一起很重大的盗窃案
<23-12,BECKETT>Yeah, a rather significant one.

634
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:13,530
<23-13,CASTLE>你们有人发觉丢了什么吗
<23-13,CASTLE>Either of you notice anything missing?

635
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,080
<23-14,STEVE>比如
<23-14,STEVE>Like what?

636
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:26,420
<23-15,STEVE>对不起  我不明白
<23-15,STEVE>I'm sorry. I don't understand.

637
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,520
<23-16,BECKETT>沃纳先生  这是你的钻石
<23-16,BECKETT>Mr. Warner, that is your diamond,

638
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:31,710
<23-16,BECKETT>100克拉的钻石
<23-16,BECKETT>All 100 carats of it.

639
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:34,500
<23-16,BECKETT>它被发现由爱丽丝持有
<23-16,BECKETT>It was found in Alice's possession.

640
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,490
<23-16,BECKETT>知道她怎么拿到的吗
<23-16,BECKETT>Any idea how she got it?

641
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:38,940
<23-17,STEVE>我想你们搞错了  这不是我们的
<23-17,STEVE>I think there's been a mistake. This isn't ours.

642
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:42,040
<23-19,JANET>-不是吗  -我从未见过这块钻石
<23-19,JANET>- It's not? - I've never that stone before in my life.

643
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:44,070
<23-20,BECKETT>真的吗
<23-20,BECKETT>Really? Well...

644
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,660
<23-20,BECKETT>那天晚上你戴着它
<23-20,BECKETT>You were wearing it the other night.

645
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,410
<23-21,JANET>我知道怎么回事了
<23-21,JANET>Oh. I see the confusion.

646
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:53,130
<23-21,JANET>我脖子上这块不是钻石
<23-21,JANET>The stone in my necklace-- that's not a diamond.

647
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:55,760
<23-21,JANET>那是礼服的一部分 只是水晶
<23-21,JANET>It's a costume piece. It's just crystal.

648
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,580
<23-22,BECKETT>水晶  沃纳夫人
<23-22,BECKETT>Crystal. Mrs. Warner,

649
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:58,920
<23-22,BECKETT>这就是那块钻石
<23-22,BECKETT>that is the same stone.

650
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:00,180
<23-23,JANET>探长  你搞错了
<23-23,JANET>Detective, you're mistaken.

651
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:02,220
<23-23,JANET>它们只是看上去相似
<23-23,JANET>They only look similar.

652
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:05,050
<23-24,BECKETT>我想你不会介意
<23-24,BECKETT>Well, then I suppose you won't mind

653
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:06,380
<23-24,BECKETT>我们派警探
<23-24,BECKETT>if we send one of our detectives

654
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:09,930
<23-24,BECKETT>和你一同回家看看吧  只是确认下
<23-24,BECKETT>Home with you to look at it? Just to be sure.

655
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,220
<23-25,STEVE>我想我们没什么好说的了
<23-25,STEVE>I think we're done here.

656
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,150
<23-25,STEVE>如果还有问题
<23-25,STEVE>If you have any more questions,

657
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,350
<23-25,STEVE>直接跟我律师谈吧
<23-25,STEVE>you can direct them to my attorneys.

658
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:17,930
<24-1,BECKETT>他们显然在撒谎
<24-1,BECKETT>Of course they're lying,

659
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:20,990
<24-1,BECKETT>但问题是他们为什么要撒谎
<24-1,BECKETT>but the real question is why are they lying?

660
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,150
<24-2,CASTLE>鉴于他们的身家
<24-2,CASTLE>Well, given their net worth,

661
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,000
<24-2,CASTLE>损失6000万美元
<24-2,CASTLE>better to take a $60-million loss

662
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:25,290
<24-2,CASTLE>比跟一具死尸扯上关系好
<24-2,CASTLE>than be connected with a dead body.

663
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,500
<24-3,BECKETT>不  卡塞尔  没这么简单
<24-3,BECKETT>No, Castle, it's more than that.

664
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:28,370
<24-3,BECKETT>如果他们知道爱丽丝偷了钻石
<24-3,BECKETT>If they knew that Alice stole that diamond,

665
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:31,040
<24-3,BECKETT>他们会报警  但他们没有
<24-3,BECKETT>they should've gone to the cops, but they didn't.

666
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,370
<24-3,BECKETT>为什么
<24-3,BECKETT>Why?

667
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:34,370
<24-4,CASTLE>因为一旦他们报警  就不得不
<24-4,CASTLE>Probably because if they did, that would mean

668
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:36,660
<24-4,CASTLE>说明钻石是哪来的
<24-4,CASTLE>having to reveal where the diamond came from.

669
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:38,290
<24-4,CASTLE>没人听说过它一定是有原因的
<24-4,CASTLE>There's gotta be a reason why no one's heard of it,

670
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,500
<24-4,CASTLE>它肯定来路不正
<24-4,CASTLE>And it must be a nefarious one.

671
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:42,830
<24-5,BECKETT>这意味着除了报警之外
<24-5,BECKETT>Which means they would do anything

672
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,520
<24-5,BECKETT>他们会不择手段把它弄回来
<24-5,BECKETT>outside of going to the cops to get it back.

673
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:46,630
<24-6,ESPOSITO>你或许是对的
<24-6,ESPOSITO>You may be right.

674
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,310
<24-6,ESPOSITO>警员刚跟沃纳夫妇在特里贝克
<24-6,ESPOSITO>So uniforms just talked to the doorman

675
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,960
<24-6,ESPOSITO>的看门人谈过话
<24-6,ESPOSITO>at the Warners' building in Tribeca.

676
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:52,770
<24-6,ESPOSITO>他说昨天早上霍克去了他们的阁楼  他给开的门
<24-6,ESPOSITO>He says he Buzzed Hawke up to their penthouse yesterday morning.

677
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:54,760
<24-7,BECKETT>而爱丽丝于昨晚被杀
<24-7,BECKETT>And Alice was killed last night.

678
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:56,920
<24-8,CASTLE>看起来纽约最著名的清道夫
<24-8,CASTLE>Looks like New York's famous fixer

679
00:27:56,930 --> 00:27:58,950
<24-8,CASTLE>有点小麻烦了
<24-8,CASTLE>is in a bit of a fix.

680
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:07,550
<25-1,HAWKE>我拜访了我在特里贝克的朋友
<25-1,HAWKE>So I visited some friends in Tribeca.

681
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,930
<25-1,HAWKE>这说明不了什么
<25-1,HAWKE>Doesn't prove anything.

682
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,230
<25-2,BECKETT>你去沃纳家做什么
<25-2,BECKETT>Why were you at the Warners'?

683
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,370
<25-3,HAWKE>我要用他们家浴室
<25-3,HAWKE>I needed to use their bathroom.

684
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:13,350
<25-3,HAWKE>不会又来吧
<25-3,HAWKE>Are we really gonna dance this dance again?

685
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,920
<25-3,HAWKE>我还有正事要忙呢
<25-3,HAWKE>'cause I got better things to do.

686
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:16,500
<25-4,BECKETT>给我坐下
<25-4,BECKETT>Sit down!

687
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:19,650
<25-4,BECKETT>赶紧  霍克先生
<25-4,BECKETT>Now, mr. Hawke.

688
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,290
<25-5,BECKETT>你休想躲掉这事
<25-5,BECKETT>You're not walking away from this one.

689
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,780
<25-5,BECKETT>我从沃纳夫妇那查到你这
<25-5,BECKETT>I've connected you to the Warners,

690
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:34,940
<25-5,BECKETT>又从沃纳夫妇回推到钻石  再回推到被害人
<25-5,BECKETT>the Warners to the stone, the stone to the dead girl,

691
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:37,050
<25-5,BECKETT>查了一圈  又从被害人回推到你头上
<25-5,BECKETT>and the dead girl back to you.

692
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,370
<25-5,BECKETT>现在  又有人
<25-5,BECKETT>And then there is also

693
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:42,730
<25-5,BECKETT>持枪攻击两名纽约警局的警探
<25-5,BECKETT>the matter of the armed assault on two N.Y.P.D. Detectives.

694
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:44,380
<25-6,HAWKE>我没杀爱丽丝·克拉克
<25-6,HAWKE>I did not kill Alice Clark,

695
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:47,200
<25-6,HAWKE>那个什么持枪攻击  跟我也没一点关系
<25-6,HAWKE>and I had nothing to do with any... assault.

696
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:48,620
<25-7,BECKETT>那跟谁有关系
<25-7,BECKETT>Then who did?

697
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:58,040
<25-8,HAWKE>把话筒关了再说
<25-8,HAWKE>Turn off the mic.

698
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:16,030
<25-9,HAWKE>干我这行的不得不小心行事
<25-9,HAWKE>My business is discretion.

699
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:19,410
<25-9,HAWKE>所以我说的话都不能记录在案  你明白吗
<25-9,HAWKE>So none of this is on the record. Do you follow?

700
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:25,850
<25-9,HAWKE>没错  的确是沃纳夫妇雇我去找钻石
<25-9,HAWKE>Yes, the Warners hired me to find the diamond.

701
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,300
<25-9,HAWKE>但仅此而已
<25-9,HAWKE>That's it.

702
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:29,130
<25-10,BECKETT>那这么说也是你了
<25-10,BECKETT>So then it was you?

703
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:31,730
<25-10,BECKETT>翻她的办公室  她的车
<25-10,BECKETT>In her office? In the car?

704
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,710
<25-10,BECKETT>是
<25-10,BECKETT>Yeah.

705
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,760
<25-11,HAWKE>但我只是去找钻石
<25-11,HAWKE>Looking for the stone,

706
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:36,270
<25-11,HAWKE>等我到达现场时  爱丽丝已经死了
<25-11,HAWKE>but Alice was already dead when I got there.

707
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,170
<25-11,HAWKE>探长  我的确做过
<25-11,HAWKE>I do things, detective--

708
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:40,830
<25-11,HAWKE>见不得人的事  但我从不行凶
<25-11,HAWKE>questionable things, but I don't kill.

709
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:42,380
<25-11,HAWKE>那行
<25-11,HAWKE>Okay.

710
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:46,260
<25-12,BECKETT>那究竟是谁攻击我的同事
<25-12,BECKETT>So then who attacked my colleagues?

711
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:47,170
<25-15,HAWKE>反正不是我
<25-15,HAWKE>Wasn't me.

712
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,010
<25-16,BECKETT>也不是沃纳夫妇
<25-16,BECKETT>Wasn't the Warners.

713
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:50,680
<25-13,HAWKE>也许还有其他人在找这块钻石
<25-13,HAWKE>Maybe somebody else was looking for the diamond.

714
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,780
<25-14,BECKETT>你又怎么知道是爱丽丝偷的钻石
<25-14,BECKETT>And how did you know Alice stole it?

715
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:55,060
<25-15,HAWKE>因为沃纳夫妇向我描述劫案过程时
<25-15,HAWKE>Because when the Warners described the mugging,

716
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:57,150
<25-15,HAWKE>我就知道是有内鬼接应
<25-15,HAWKE>I could tell it was an inside job.

717
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,180
<25-16,BECKETT>沃纳夫妇被劫了
<25-16,BECKETT>The Warners were mugged?

718
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:02,360
<25-16,BECKETT>就在两天前  而且劫匪绝不是临时起意
<25-16,BECKETT>Two nights ago, and it wasn't random.

719
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:05,840
<25-17,HAWKE>劫匪非常清楚什么时候下手  朝哪下手
<25-17,HAWKE>The mugger knew exactly when and where they were gonna be.

720
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:06,910
<25-17,HAWKE>爱丽丝也知道这些
<25-17,HAWKE>So did Alice.

721
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,710
<25-17,HAWKE>不仅如此  在一次咨询疗程中
<25-17,HAWKE>Not only that, but Janet told Alice

722
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,740
<25-17,HAWKE>珍妮特把钻石保存地点告诉了爱丽丝
<25-17,HAWKE>about the diamond in one of their sessions.

723
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:13,600
<25-17,HAWKE>显然不太可能有别人知道那钻石是真品
<25-17,HAWKE>Apparently, hardly anyone else knew the diamond was real.

724
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:15,720
<25-17,HAWKE>所以我推测爱丽丝肯定身涉其中
<25-17,HAWKE>I figured Alice had to be involved.

725
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:17,580
<25-18,BECKETT>如果沃纳被劫了
<25-18,BECKETT>Okay, so if the Warners were mugged,

726
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:19,420
<25-18,BECKETT>他们为什么不报警
<25-18,BECKETT>why wouldn't they just go to the police?

727
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:21,530
<25-19,HAWKE>他们不想声张
<25-19,HAWKE>They wanted to keep things quiet.

728
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:23,840
<25-19,HAWKE>好
<25-19,HAWKE>Okay.

729
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:28,470
<25-20,BECKETT>我需要你详细说明那次抢劫的具体细节
<25-20,BECKETT>I need you to tell me everything you know about that mugging.

730
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:30,930
<25-20,BECKETT>劫案发生时沃纳夫妇在哪
<25-20,BECKETT>Where were they when it happened?

731
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:34,000
<25-21,HAWKE>他们正从大赦义演现场步行回家
<25-21,HAWKE>While they were walking home from the amnesty benefit.

732
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:36,530
<25-22,BECKETT>爱丽丝是如何作案的
<25-22,BECKETT>And how did Alice pull it off?

733
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,150
<25-22,BECKETT>不是她下的手
<25-22,BECKETT>She didn't.

734
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,380
<25-23,HAWKE>沃纳夫妇说尽管劫匪戴着滑雪面具
<25-23,HAWKE>The Warners said the mugger wore a ski mask

735
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:42,990
<25-23,HAWKE>但肯定是个男的
<25-23,HAWKE>but was definitely male.

736
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,820
<26-1,GATES>爱丽丝还有个同伙
<26-1,GATES>Alice had an accomplice?

737
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:49,320
<26-2,BECKETT>如果霍克说的是真话
<26-2,BECKETT>If Hawke's telling the truth,

738
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:50,820
<26-2,BECKETT>那就还有其他人涉案
<26-2,BECKETT>then there's another player involved--

739
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:52,680
<26-2,BECKETT>此人知道那钻石是真品
<26-2,BECKETT>Someone who knew that the diamond was real

740
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:54,540
<26-2,BECKETT>于是利用爱丽丝将其抢到手
<26-2,BECKETT>and used Alice to get it.

741
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:55,920
<26-3,GATES>你是说爱丽丝身不由己
<26-3,GATES>Do you think Alice was under duress?

742
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:57,810
<26-3,GATES>被这个同伙强拉下水
<26-3,GATES>That someone was forcing her to help?

743
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,440
<26-4,CASTLE>威胁要杀了她
<26-4,CASTLE>Threatening to kill her?

744
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:00,810
<26-4,CASTLE>这就能解释她为什么要这么做
<26-4,CASTLE>That would explain why she did it

745
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:03,090
<26-4,CASTLE>以及为什么她想要躲起来
<26-4,CASTLE>and why she was trying to disappear.

746
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,620
<26-5,ESPOSITO>那辆袭警的车有线索了
<26-5,ESPOSITO>Hey, we got a hit on our clown car.

747
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:07,540
<26-5,ESPOSITO>巡警发现这辆越野车被遗弃在东河边上
<26-5,ESPOSITO>Uniforms found it abandoned by the East River.

748
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:09,340
<26-6,RYAN>车被清洗过  还被一把火烧了
<26-6,RYAN>S.U.V.'s been bleached and torched.

749
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:10,770
<26-6,RYAN>鉴定科的人正试着清理收集线索
<26-6,RYAN>C.S.U.'s scouring it for clues,

750
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,590
<26-6,RYAN>但看起来不那么容易
<26-6,RYAN>but seems like it was a high-level job.

751
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,720
<26-6,RYAN>另外托瑞那查到了抢劫案的线索
<26-6,RYAN>And Tory has something on the mugging.

752
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:16,150
<27-1,TORI>根据霍克的线索
<27-1,TORI>Okay, now according to Hawke,

753
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,580
<27-1,TORI>当晚11点劫匪在第52街抢走钻石
<27-1,TORI>the mugger snatched the necklace

754
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:21,580
<27-1,TORI>然后向南朝着第八大道逃窜
<27-1,TORI>at 11 o'clock on 52nd street and bolted south on 8th.

755
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:25,120
<27-1,TORI>可惜附近没有监控或安保摄像头
<27-1,TORI>Unfortunately, there are no street or security cams in the vicinity,

756
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:27,820
<27-1,TORI>但是几分钟后有人在第49街和第八大道
<27-1,TORI>but a 9-1-1 call came in two minutes later

757
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:31,550
<27-1,TORI>交叉口处报警  离案发现场仅3个街区
<27-1,TORI>from 49th and 8th-- 3 blocks away.

758
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,990
<27-2,OPERATOR>这里是接警台  你有什么紧急情况
<27-2,OPERATOR>9-1-1. What's your emergency?

759
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,360
<27-3,WOMAN>这里有一起肇事逃逸
<27-3,WOMAN>There's been a hit and run.

760
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:35,140
<27-4,OPERATOR>您现在在哪
<27-4,OPERATOR>What's your location?

761
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:35,960
<27-4,OPERATOR>我会派辆救护车过去
<27-4,OPERATOR>I'll send an ambulance.

762
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:37,750
<27-5,WOMAN>不是  你没明白
<27-5,WOMAN>No! You don't understand.

763
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,710
<27-5,WOMAN>是我肇了事  被撞的人逃逸了
<27-5,WOMAN>I hit someone, and he ran.

764
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,210
<27-6,OPERATOR>他跑了
<27-6,OPERATOR>He ran?

765
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:43,370
<27-7,WOMAN>是的  他穿一身黑衣  戴着个滑雪面具
<27-7,WOMAN>Yeah, a man dressed all in black, wearing a ski mask.

766
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,690
<27-7,WOMAN>不知从哪里窜出来的
<27-7,WOMAN>He came out of nowhere.

767
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,230
<27-8,BECKETT>肯定就是我们要找的人
<27-8,BECKETT>That's gotta be our guy.

768
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:46,810
<27-8,BECKETT>找到车主
<27-8,BECKETT>Get over there.

769
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:47,970
<27-8,BECKETT>让她详尽描述一下
<27-8,BECKETT>Get a full description.

770
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,940
<28-1,WOMAN>我到现在仿佛都能听见他"嘭"的一声
<28-1,WOMAN>I can still hear the sound of his body

771
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:51,660
<28-1,WOMAN>撞在我车前盖上的声音
<28-1,WOMAN>going "thunk" on my hood.

772
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:52,790
<28-2,RYAN>你还记得他是什么样子吗
<28-2,RYAN>Do you remember what he looked like?

773
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,900
<28-3,WOMAN>不记得  整件事都有点记不清了
<28-3,WOMAN>No. The whole thing was a blur.

774
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:56,700
<28-3,WOMAN>光记得那瘆死人的一声
<28-3,WOMAN>Just that god-awful sound.

775
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:58,570
<28-3,WOMAN>他撞得那么狠  我车前盖上都留了个印子
<28-3,WOMAN>He hit so hard, he left a dent.

776
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:00,130
<28-3,WOMAN>但我下车的时候
<28-3,WOMAN>But when I got out of my car,

777
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:03,090
<28-3,WOMAN>他挣扎着起来  就朝第49街跑了
<28-3,WOMAN>he just pushed himself off and ran down 49th.

778
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,820
<28-3,WOMAN>就是这  我演示给你们看
<28-3,WOMAN>Here. I'll show you.

779
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:06,610
<28-3,WOMAN>他的手摁在这里
<28-3,WOMAN>His hands were up like this,

780
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:07,530
<28-4,RYAN>-然后  -谢谢您
<28-4,RYAN>- and then-- - Thank you.

781
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:09,100
<28-4,RYAN>非常感谢
<28-4,RYAN>Thank you very much.

782
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:10,530
<28-5,ESPOSITO>好  我去叫鉴证组
<28-5,ESPOSITO>All right. I'll call C.S.U.

783
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:11,680
<28-6,RYAN>我是莱恩
<28-6,RYAN>Ryan here.

784
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:12,470
<28-6,RYAN>你好  警探
<28-6,RYAN>Yes, Detective.

785
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,680
<28-7,PETERS>我是爱德华·彼得斯
<28-7,PETERS>Edward Peters here.

786
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:16,570
<28-7,PETERS>我想我已经对你拿来的钻石有了新结论
<28-7,PETERS>I believe I have new insights into your diamond.

787
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:18,740
<28-7,PETERS>我们反复检查了钻石的测试结果
<28-7,PETERS>After reviewing test results on the stone,

788
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:20,740
<28-7,PETERS>我和我的同事达成了一致看法
<28-7,PETERS>my colleagues and I all reached the same conclusion.

789
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:21,990
<28-8,RYAN>是什么
<28-8,RYAN>Which is?

790
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,840
<28-9,PETERS>这块钻石完美无瑕
<28-9,PETERS>The diamond is flawless--

791
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:26,070
<28-9,PETERS>大自然也造化不出如此完美的钻石
<28-9,PETERS>flawless beyond anything nature could create.

792
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,200
<28-10,RYAN>你是说那钻石是假的
<28-10,RYAN>Oh, you're saying it's fake?

793
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:30,010
<28-11,PETERS>不  它的确是碳结晶而且货真价实
<28-11,PETERS>No, it's composed of carbon and entirely real,

794
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:31,610
<28-11,PETERS>只不过是人工制成品
<28-11,PETERS>but it is man-made.

795
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:34,220
<28-12,RYAN>人工制成品是什么意思
<28-12,RYAN>Whoa. Whoa, whoa, what are you saying, man-made?

796
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:36,910
<28-13,PETERS>工业制钻工艺早已有之
<28-13,PETERS>There have long been industrially produced diamonds,

797
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:40,320
<28-13,PETERS>像大自然母亲那样  对碳高温加压
<28-13,PETERS>carbon under heat and pressure, mimicking Mother Nature in a lab.

798
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:43,760
<28-13,PETERS>但这样制出的钻石要么很小要么品质低劣
<28-13,PETERS>But typically the stones are small or of inferior quality.

799
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:46,820
<28-14,RYAN>也就是说这块钻石不值6000万
<28-14,RYAN>So... it's not worth $60 million.

800
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,230
<28-14,RYAN>当然不
<28-14,RYAN>No.

801
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,880
<28-15,PETERS>比6000万多得多
<28-15,PETERS>It's actually worth infinitely more.

802
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:54,380
<28-15,PETERS>事实上  它是无价之宝
<28-15,PETERS>In fact, it's priceless.

803
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:56,110
<28-16,RYAN>无价之宝
<28-16,RYAN>Priceless?

804
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,150
<28-16,RYAN>无价之宝
<28-16,RYAN>Priceless?

805
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,980
<29-2,RYAN>没错  考虑到它的大小和质量
<29-2,RYAN>Yeah, apparently, a stone of that size and quality--

806
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:02,170
<29-2,RYAN>可谓是人造钻石的圣杯
<29-2,RYAN>it's the holy grail of diamond manufacturing,

807
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:04,760
<29-2,RYAN>这几乎是不可能实现的
<29-2,RYAN>considered by most to be impossible.

808
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:05,720
<29-3,CASTLE>迄今为止
<29-3,CASTLE>Until now.

809
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:07,850
<29-4,BECKETT>那沃纳夫妇是从哪得来的
<29-4,BECKETT>So... where did the Warners get it?

810
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:10,140
<29-4,BECKETT>又为什么要否认它的存在
<29-4,BECKETT>And why are they denying its existence?

811
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:10,780
<29-5,RYAN>我不知道
<29-5,RYAN>I don't know.

812
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:14,850
<29-6,CASTLE>我想我知道是谁想要并袭击了你们
<29-6,CASTLE>I think I know who wanted it and who attacked you boys.

813
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,740
<29-6,CASTLE>钻石可以在实验室合成
<29-6,CASTLE>A diamond like that made in a lab--

814
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:18,700
<29-6,CASTLE>这会让钻石公司破产
<29-6,CASTLE>that would put diamond companies out of business.

815
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:20,750
<29-7,RYAN>你认为是钻石行业派来的小丑
<29-7,RYAN>You think it's the diamond industry who sent in the clowns?

816
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,440
<29-8,CASTLE>考虑到行业的未来
<29-8,CASTLE>With the future of their industry at stake,

817
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:23,860
<29-8,CASTLE>天晓得他们会做出什么事
<29-8,CASTLE>who knows how far they'd go?

818
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:24,710
<29-8,CASTLE>伙计们
<29-8,CASTLE>Hey, guys.

819
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,630
<29-9,ESPOSITO>托瑞有线索
<29-9,ESPOSITO>Tory got a hit.

820
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,840
<30-1,BECKETT>听说鉴证组提取到了一枚指纹
<30-1,BECKETT>So C.S.U. was able to pull a usable print?

821
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:30,600
<30-2,ESPOSITO>是  我们很幸运  她不太愿意洗车
<30-2,ESPOSITO>Yeah, lucky for us, the lady wasn't big into washing her car.

822
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:33,570
<30-3,TORI>我们扫描指纹时  联邦数据库没有信息
<30-3,TORI>When we ran the print, nothing popped in the federal database.

823
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:35,890
<30-4,ESPOSITO>但考虑到钻石业的国际性
<30-4,ESPOSITO>But given the international nature of the diamond industry,

824
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,820
<30-4,ESPOSITO>我让托瑞扩大了搜索范围
<30-4,ESPOSITO>I asked Tory to cast a wider net.

825
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:38,860
<30-4,ESPOSITO>我们联系了国际刑警
<30-4,ESPOSITO>We contacted interpol.

826
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:40,190
<30-5,RYAN>我们的劫匪是外国人
<30-5,RYAN>Our mugger's a foreign national?

827
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,480
<30-6,TORI>确切的说是南非人
<30-6,TORI>South African, to be exact.

828
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:43,340
<30-6,TORI>他的名字叫里奥·维恩加德
<30-6,TORI>His name is Leo Wyngaard--

829
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:45,580
<30-6,TORI>蹲遍了半数非洲监狱
<30-6,TORI>In and out of half a dozen African prisons.

830
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:47,520
<30-7,ESPOSITO>更别提他还上了恐怖分子名单
<30-7,ESPOSITO>Not to mention, he's on the terror watch list.

831
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:51,200
<30-8,CASTLE>一看就是钻石集团会雇来干坏事的那种人
<30-8,CASTLE>Just the kind of guy a diamond cartel would hire for their dirty work.

832
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:52,940
<30-9,ESPOSITO>现在给他们看照片
<30-9,ESPOSITO>Now show 'em the picture.

833
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,190
<30-10,ESPOSITO>眼熟吧
<30-10,ESPOSITO>Look familiar?

834
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,060
<30-11,BECKETT>他是马特·兰切特
<30-11,BECKETT>That's Matt Lanchet.

835
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:58,590
<30-12,CASTLE>爱丽丝的男朋友
<30-12,CASTLE>Alice's boyfriend.

836
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:03,470
<31-1,RYAN>我们差点在肯尼迪机场错过他
<31-1,RYAN>We almost missed him at J.F.K.

837
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,430
<31-1,RYAN>他正准备去约翰内斯堡
<31-1,RYAN>He was boarding a flight to Johannesburg.

838
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,340
<31-2,GATES>他一得知我们拿到了钻石就想赶紧抽身
<31-2,GATES>He must have cut his losses once he knew we had secured the diamond.

839
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:10,790
<31-3,ESPOSITO>我还是不明白沃纳夫妇
<31-3,ESPOSITO>I still don't get why the Warners

840
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,870
<31-3,ESPOSITO>是从哪里得到这么块人造钻石的
<31-3,ESPOSITO>had a man-made stone in the first place.

841
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,730
<31-4,RYAN>不管是什么原因  里奥想要那钻石
<31-4,RYAN>Well, whatever the reason, Leo wanted that diamond,

842
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:17,810
<31-4,RYAN>并且利用爱丽丝得到它
<31-4,RYAN>and he was using Alice to get it.

843
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:20,370
<31-5,ESPOSITO>也就是说他强迫她帮忙
<31-5,ESPOSITO>Meaning he leveraged her into helping him,

844
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:23,500
<31-5,ESPOSITO>逼她取出钱并订好了飞机
<31-5,ESPOSITO>forced her to pull the money out and order up the plane.

845
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:25,040
<31-6,GATES>然后杀了她
<31-6,GATES>Then he killed her,

846
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:28,600
<31-6,GATES>把事情弄得像全是她一个人的主意
<31-6,GATES>made this whole thing look like it was her idea.

847
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:30,730
<31-7,RYAN>长官  鉴于这家伙之前为了钻石
<31-7,RYAN>Sir, considering that this guy

848
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:32,620
<31-7,RYAN>想把我和埃斯波置于死地
<31-7,RYAN>tried to kill me and Espo for that diamond,

849
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:35,030
<31-7,RYAN>能不能让我们进去问个究竟
<31-7,RYAN>you mind if we go in there and get some answers?

850
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:39,350
<31-7,RYAN>等等
<31-7,RYAN>Wait.

851
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,910
<32-1,LEO WYNGAARD>你们以为我是为钻石集团卖命
<32-1,LEO WYNGAARD>You think I'm working for the cartels?

852
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,990
<32-1,LEO WYNGAARD>是我在利用爱丽丝
<32-1,LEO WYNGAARD>That I was using Alice?

853
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:45,250
<32-1,LEO WYNGAARD>我爱爱丽丝
<32-1,LEO WYNGAARD>I loved Alice.

854
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:47,880
<32-2,RYAN>你老是用假名字和你爱的女人在一起吗
<32-2,RYAN>You always use fake names with women that you love?

855
00:34:47,890 --> 00:34:49,120
<32-3,LEO>她知道我的真实身份
<32-3,LEO>She knew who I really was.

856
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:50,010
<32-3,LEO>我们是一起干的
<32-3,LEO>We were in this together.

857
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:51,690
<32-4,ESPOSITO>那是当然
<32-4,ESPOSITO>Yeah, sure, you were.

858
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:53,800
<32-4,ESPOSITO>你为什么要偷那钻石
<32-4,ESPOSITO>Why would you steal that diamond?

859
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:57,100
<32-5,LEO>我和爱丽丝相遇在卢旺达  当时我在做援助
<32-5,LEO>Alice and I met in Rwanda when I was doing aid work.

860
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:58,780
<32-5,LEO>我们年轻  我们相爱了
<32-5,LEO>We were young and in love.

861
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:01,570
<32-5,LEO>有一天  士兵闯进了村子
<32-5,LEO>Then one day, soldiers came to the village,

862
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:03,690
<32-5,LEO>是钻石集团雇的
<32-5,LEO>financed by the diamond cartel.

863
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:06,690
<32-5,LEO>我们躲在丛林里亲眼看见他们屠杀了每一个人
<32-5,LEO>We watched from the jungle as they slaughtered everyone--

864
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:09,900
<32-5,LEO>为了利益争地盘而血流成河
<32-5,LEO>Casualties of a turf war for profit.

865
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:11,740
<32-5,LEO>那一天改变了我
<32-5,LEO>That day changed me.

866
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:16,390
<32-5,LEO>我决心要用毕生阻止钻石集团的血腥行径
<32-5,LEO>I dedicated myself to stopping the cartels' bloody practices.

867
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,540
<32-5,LEO>我知道不能让爱丽丝卷入这种生活
<32-5,LEO>It was a life I knew Alice couldn't be a part of,

868
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:20,770
<32-5,LEO>但我从没停止过爱她
<32-5,LEO>but I never stopped loving her.

869
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:23,030
<32-6,RYAN>所以你偷了一颗人造钻石
<32-6,RYAN>So you're working against the cartels

870
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,700
<32-6,RYAN>这就是你对付钻石集团的办法
<32-6,RYAN>by stealing a man-made diamond?

871
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:30,390
<32-7,LEO>两年前  钻石开始出现在
<32-7,LEO>Two years ago, stones started popping up

872
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,670
<32-7,LEO>欧洲和中东市场
<32-7,LEO>in Europe and the Middle East--

873
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:35,270
<32-7,LEO>由于完美无缺  卖出了数百万的价钱
<32-7,LEO>Flawless, being sold for millions.

874
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:39,490
<32-7,LEO>这时我的一个宝石专家朋友偶然得到了两颗
<32-7,LEO>That's when a gemologist friend of mine happened across a pair of them.

875
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:42,990
<32-7,LEO>他发现它们是完全相同的
<32-7,LEO>He discovered that they were exactly the same.

876
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,740
<32-7,LEO>大自然决不会造出完全相同的两件物品
<32-7,LEO>Nature doesn't make exact copies.

877
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:47,970
<32-8,ESPOSITO>它们是人造的
<32-8,ESPOSITO>They were man-made.

878
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:52,010
<32-9,LEO>没错  我试着追踪它们的来源
<32-9,LEO>Yeah. I tried to trace them back to their source.

879
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:54,830
<32-9,LEO>但我只知道它们来自美国
<32-9,LEO>All I knew was that they were coming out of The States,

880
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:57,020
<32-9,LEO>这时爱丽丝突然联系了我
<32-9,LEO>and then Alice called me out of the blue,

881
00:35:57,030 --> 00:36:00,500
<32-9,LEO>说她的一个客户  史蒂夫·沃纳有个秘密
<32-9,LEO>said one of her clients, Steve Warner, had a secret.

882
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:03,750
<32-10,ESPOSITO>等等  你是要告诉我史蒂夫·沃纳能做钻石
<32-10,ESPOSITO>Wait. Are you telling me that Steve Warner can make diamonds?

883
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,840
<32-10,ESPOSITO>没错
<32-10,ESPOSITO>Yes.

884
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:06,670
<32-11,LEO>人造钻石并不稀奇
<32-11,LEO>Man-made diamonds are nothing new,

885
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:09,720
<32-11,LEO>但之前没人能做出那个质量
<32-11,LEO>but no one had ever produced this quality of gem before--

886
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:12,030
<32-11,LEO>大而没有瑕疵
<32-11,LEO>big and flawless.

887
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,790
<32-11,LEO>钻石开采很快就会成为历史
<32-11,LEO>Soon, diamond mines would be a relic of the past.

888
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,440
<32-11,LEO>史蒂夫·沃纳的技术能改变一切
<32-11,LEO>Steve Warner's technology could change everything.

889
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:19,320
<32-11,LEO>于是我联系到了沃纳本人
<32-11,LEO>So I approached Warner.

890
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:21,340
<32-11,LEO>我请求他能把他的技术公开
<32-11,LEO>I begged him to make his technology available,

891
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:23,120
<32-11,LEO>但他否认他拥有这项技术
<32-11,LEO>but he denied he even had it.

892
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:25,020
<32-11,LEO>这技术只是用来让他中饱私囊
<32-11,LEO>He was just using it to line his own pockets.

893
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:27,870
<32-11,LEO>我们要让世人知道  我们需要证据
<32-11,LEO>The world needed to know, and we needed proof.

894
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,790
<32-12,ESPOSITO>那条项链就是证据
<32-12,ESPOSITO>The necklace.

895
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,470
<32-13,LEO>我们知道如果我们能检查一下那块钻石
<32-13,LEO>We knew that if we could just examine that stone,

896
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,990
<32-13,LEO>我们就能把它和其他两个联系在一起
<32-13,LEO>that we could tie it back to the others,

897
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,620
<32-13,LEO>我们就能向所有人揭露他们的行径
<32-13,LEO>then we could show everyone what it was doing,

898
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:36,930
<32-13,LEO>人们能亲眼看到人造钻石是有可能的
<32-13,LEO>and they could all see that it was possible.

899
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:40,210
<32-13,LEO>每个人终能打开贸易壁垒
<32-13,LEO>Then... everyone would eventually unlock the code.

900
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:42,500
<32-14,ESPOSITO>顷刻间  完美无瑕的人造钻石
<32-14,ESPOSITO>Then all of a sudden, flawless, man-made diamonds

901
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:44,030
<32-14,ESPOSITO>涌入市场
<32-14,ESPOSITO>would flood the market.

902
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:47,400
<32-15,LEO>没有钻石集团  就没有流血事件
<32-15,LEO>No more cartels. No more sponsored bloodshed.

903
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:50,390
<32-15,LEO>我们就能改变世界
<32-15,LEO>We were gonna change the world.

904
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:55,750
<32-15,LEO>那晚爱丽丝订了一架飞机带我们去一个私人实验室
<32-15,LEO>That night, alice had a plane standing by to take us to a private lab.

905
00:36:57,130 --> 00:36:58,540
<32-15,LEO>但她没有出现
<32-15,LEO>But she never showed.

906
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:01,120
<32-16,ESPOSITO>还有没有谁知道你们要拿走钻石
<32-16,ESPOSITO>Did anyone else know you'd taken the diamond?

907
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:04,110
<32-17,LEO>知道钻石丢失的人就只有
<32-17,LEO>The only people that knew that diamond was gone

908
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:08,130
<32-17,LEO>我  爱丽丝和沃纳夫妇
<32-17,LEO>were me, Alice, and the Warners.

909
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:11,940
<33-1,STEVE>我们说过  我们不会回答关于钻石的任何问题
<33-1,STEVE>We told you, we're not answering questions about that diamond.

910
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:12,630
<33-1,STEVE>行  没问题
<33-1,STEVE>Yeah, that's okay.

911
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,570
<33-2,BECKETT>你们也说不出什么我们不知道的事情了
<33-2,BECKETT>There's nothing that you can say that we don't already know.

912
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:19,000
<33-2,BECKETT>比如  我们知道那是人造的
<33-2,BECKETT>For instance, we know it's man-made.

913
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:21,790
<33-3,CASTLE>我们也知道制造钻石的人就是你
<33-3,CASTLE>And we know you are the man who made it.

914
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,670
<33-4,BECKETT>我们还知道
<33-4,BECKETT>We also know that...

915
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:27,270
<33-4,BECKETT>背地里将这些人造钻石
<33-4,BECKETT>You made a lot of cash secretly selling

916
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,590
<33-4,BECKETT>贩卖到海外让你赚了不少现款
<33-4,BECKETT>those man-made diamonds on foreign markets.

917
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,570
<33-5,STEVE>太荒谬了
<33-5,STEVE>That's ridiculous.

918
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:31,570
<33-5,STEVE>你知道我身价有多少吗
<33-5,STEVE>Do you know what I'm worth?

919
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:32,390
<33-5,STEVE>我为什么要干那种勾当
<33-5,STEVE>Why would I do that?

920
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,170
<33-6,BECKETT>经济危机的时候你收到了沉重打击
<33-6,BECKETT>You took a huge hit during the economic downturn.

921
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:37,500
<33-6,BECKETT>你当时向各方欠下巨债
<33-6,BECKETT>You were leveraged to the hilt.

922
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:38,910
<33-6,BECKETT>你需要大量现款
<33-6,BECKETT>You needed that cash.

923
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,550
<33-7,STEVE>就算你说的是真的
<33-7,STEVE>Even if what you're saying is true,

924
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,320
<33-7,STEVE>也不代表是我杀了爱丽丝
<33-7,STEVE>that doesn't mean I murdered Alice!

925
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:45,940
<33-8,BECKETT>但你的确雇了霍克去找回钻石
<33-8,BECKETT>You did hire Hawke to get that diamond back.

926
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,240
<33-8,BECKETT>好吧
<33-8,BECKETT>Okay.

927
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,910
<33-9,STEVE>我也是别无他法了
<33-9,STEVE>I had to.

928
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:55,000
<33-9,STEVE>我怕范·勒恩发现我的生意
<33-9,STEVE>I was afraid Von Roenn would find out.

929
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:57,000
<33-10,CASTLE>范·勒恩  那个钻石集团头目
<33-10,CASTLE>VonRoenn, the diamond cartel?

930
00:37:57,010 --> 00:37:58,850
<33-10,CASTLE>他们跟这事有什么关系
<33-10,CASTLE>What do they have to do with this?

931
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:01,010
<33-11,STEVE>我还在工程学院的时候
<33-11,STEVE>When I was in engineering school,

932
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:04,040
<33-11,STEVE>发明了在实验室制造钻石的方法
<33-11,STEVE>I developed a process for lab-grown diamonds.

933
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:07,030
<33-11,STEVE>但当时的成品又小又有瑕疵
<33-11,STEVE>But all I could manage were small flawed stones.

934
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,770
<33-11,STEVE>一点也不值钱
<33-11,STEVE>They were worthless.

935
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,830
<33-11,STEVE>那是我身无分文  所以把这项技术卖给了
<33-11,STEVE>At the time I had no money, so I sold the technology

936
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:15,140
<33-11,STEVE>唯一对它感兴趣的人  范·勒恩
<33-11,STEVE>to the only people interested-- VonRoenn.

937
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:17,470
<33-12,JANET>他们想打压竞争对手
<33-12,JANET>They wanted to stifle the competition.

938
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,510
<33-12,JANET>保护自己的市场份额
<33-12,JANET>You know, protect their market share.

939
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,230
<33-13,STEVE>几年前  我与珍妮特的关系遇到瓶颈
<33-13,STEVE>Then a few years ago, Janet and I hit a rough patch.

940
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,820
<33-13,STEVE>我想送她点有意义的东西
<33-13,STEVE>And I wanted to give her something meaningful.

941
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:27,690
<33-13,STEVE>要买一颗钻石太容易了
<33-13,STEVE>It was too easy just to buy her a diamond.

942
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,860
<33-14,BECKETT>所以我觉得自己做一颗
<33-14,BECKETT>So you decided to make one of your own.

943
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:31,930
<33-15,STEVE>我找出我的实验设备
<33-15,STEVE>I broke out my equipment

944
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:34,390
<33-15,STEVE>以便给她做颗小钻石
<33-15,STEVE>so I could make her a small diamond.

945
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:35,450
<33-15,STEVE>但在制作过程中
<33-15,STEVE>But in the process,

946
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:37,270
<33-15,STEVE>我取得了惊人的突破
<33-15,STEVE>I had a game-changing breakthrough.

947
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,920
<33-15,STEVE>我的小浪漫
<33-15,STEVE>My little romantic gesture

948
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:42,670
<33-15,STEVE>造就了史上最大颗的钻石之一
<33-15,STEVE>became one of the biggest diamonds in history.

949
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:46,870
<33-15,STEVE>忽然间  我能够制作完美的钻石了
<33-15,STEVE>Suddenly, I could make flawless stones...

950
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:48,960
<33-15,STEVE>想做多少就多少
<33-15,STEVE>As many as I wanted.

951
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:52,300
<33-16,CASTLE>这项技术现在是属于范·勒恩
<33-16,CASTLE>With technology that now belong to VonRoenn.

952
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:54,380
<33-16,CASTLE>经济危机的时候你们需要大量现金
<33-16,CASTLE>And when the downturn hit and you needed cash...

953
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:58,140
<33-17,BECKETT>意识到只要不被发现  这是再好不过的生财之道
<33-17,BECKETT>You realized you had the means as long as no one knew.

954
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:59,310
<33-18,STEVE>但它违反了我们的协议
<33-18,STEVE>It violated our agreement.

955
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:02,150
<33-18,STEVE>如果范·勒恩发现这事  他们会毁了我
<33-18,STEVE>If Von Roenn found out, they'd ruin me.

956
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,310
<33-19,BECKETT>这也是你雇佣突袭队
<33-19,BECKETT>Which is why you hired a strike team

957
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,580
<33-19,BECKETT>要从我们手里抢回钻石的原因
<33-19,BECKETT>to recover that stone from our custody.

958
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:09,280
<33-20,STEVE>什么  我不知道你们在说什么
<33-20,STEVE>What? I don't know what you're talking about.

959
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:11,510
<33-21,BECKETT>沃纳先生  我们找到了突袭队乘坐的车子
<33-21,BECKETT>Mr. Warner, we found the SUV they used.

960
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,130
<33-21,BECKETT>它已经被烧毁
<33-21,BECKETT>It had been torched.

961
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:16,500
<33-21,BECKETT>但鉴证组把汽车识别码恢复了
<33-21,BECKETT>But CSU Still was able to pull the VIN number.

962
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:18,710
<33-22,CASTLE>结果显示  车是在皇后区的车库里被偷的
<33-22,CASTLE>Turns out it was stolen from a garage in Queens.

963
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,150
<33-22,CASTLE>车库的所有人约瑟夫·比安奇先生
<33-22,CASTLE>And the garage owner, Joseph Bianchi?

964
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,310
<33-22,CASTLE>他是你保安主管的连襟
<33-22,CASTLE>He's the brother-in-law of your head of security.

965
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,660
<33-22,CASTLE>我们还查到通联纪录
<33-22,CASTLE>We also pulled phone records

966
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:27,370
<33-22,CASTLE>发现你和他曾在
<33-22,CASTLE>and found that you and he had exchanged

967
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:30,980
<33-22,CASTLE>袭击发生前的一小时之内通话至少六次
<33-22,CASTLE>at least half a dozen phone calls in the hours before the attack.

968
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:31,890
<33-23,STEVE>什么
<33-23,STEVE>What?

969
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,420
<33-24,BECKETT>你对袭击下达了指令
<33-24,BECKETT>You ordered that strike.

970
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:34,950
<33-25,STEVE>我没打过那些电话
<33-25,STEVE>I-I didn't make these calls.

971
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,410
<33-25,STEVE>我当时根本不在家
<33-25,STEVE>I-I wasn't even home.

972
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:38,110
<33-25,STEVE>这是...
<33-25,STEVE>It's--I--

973
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,810
<33-25,STEVE>不
<33-25,STEVE>No.

974
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:44,530
<33-25,STEVE>珍妮特
<33-25,STEVE>Janet?

975
00:39:44,810 --> 00:39:46,540
<33-25,STEVE>你做了什么
<33-25,STEVE>What did you do?

976
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,260
<33-25,STEVE>我做了什么
<33-25,STEVE>What did I do?

977
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:52,550
<33-26,JANET>我当她是自家人
<33-26,JANET>I treated her like family.

978
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,320
<33-26,JANET>信任她
<33-26,JANET>I trusted her.

979
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:57,210
<33-26,JANET>当霍克查出是爱丽丝偷了钻石  我去见她
<33-26,JANET>When Hawke found out it was Alice, I went to her,

980
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:59,960
<33-26,JANET>求她把钻石还给我
<33-26,JANET>begging for her to give the stone back.

981
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:01,780
<33-26,JANET>我只是想吓吓她
<33-26,JANET>I only meant to scare her,

982
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:04,110
<33-26,JANET>但她对我举起枪
<33-26,JANET>But she grabbed for the gun and...

983
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:07,190
<33-26,JANET>她可能会暴露我们的生意  史蒂夫
<33-26,JANET>she would've exposed us, Steve.

984
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,480
<33-26,JANET>那样我们就什么都没有了
<33-26,JANET>We were going to lose everything.

985
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:12,990
<33-26,JANET>我必须阻止她
<33-26,JANET>I had to stop her. I had to get it back...

986
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:14,970
<33-26,JANET>为了我们
<33-26,JANET>For us.

987
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:17,390
<33-26,JANET>为了你
<33-26,JANET>For you.

988
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:32,390
<34-1,CASTLE>不准睁眼哦
<34-1,CASTLE>Keep 'em closed.

989
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,470
<34-2,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我发誓  你要是把我送到莱纳斯面前
<34-2,BECKETT>Castle, I swear if you're bringing me face-to-face with Linus,

990
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,560
<34-2,BECKETT>我会拿枪射它
<34-2,BECKETT>I'm gonna pull my gun out and shoot him.

991
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:38,870
<34-3,CASTLE>没那个必要
<34-3,CASTLE>That will not be necessary.

992
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:39,780
<34-4,BECKETT>好吧
<34-4,BECKETT>Okay.

993
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:41,280
<34-5,CASTLE>好了  睁开吧
<34-5,CASTLE>Okay, open.

994
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,690
<34-6,BECKETT>贝壳
<34-6,BECKETT>Seashells?

995
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:47,130
<34-7,CASTLE>不仅仅是贝壳
<34-7,CASTLE>Well, not just seashells.

996
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:48,640
<34-7,CASTLE>这些是我们的贝壳
<34-7,CASTLE>Those are our seashells.

997
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:49,530
<34-7,CASTLE>是我们第一次一起在
<34-7,CASTLE>We collected those--

998
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:52,670
<34-8,BECKETT>汉普顿散步的时候捡的
<34-8,BECKETT>On our first walk in the hamptons.

999
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:55,730
<34-9,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你把它们都留下啦
<34-9,BECKETT>Castle, you kept these?

1000
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:57,680
<34-10,CASTLE>我知道它们摆在这里有点不搭
<34-10,CASTLE>Now, I know it doesn't really go with the space

1001
00:40:57,690 --> 00:41:00,250
<34-10,CASTLE>但至少它们在早晨不会流着口水盯着你
<34-10,CASTLE>but at least it won't be hungrily staring at you in the morning.

1002
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:01,620
<34-11,BECKETT>你不用为我做这些的
<34-11,BECKETT>You didn't have to do this.

1003
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:04,280
<34-12,CASTLE>不  我应该的  我刚读完爱丽丝的书
<34-12,CASTLE>No, I did. I did. I finished reading Alice's book,

1004
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:07,290
<34-12,CASTLE>其中有一章是写给我们这类伴侣的
<34-12,CASTLE>and there's a chapter in there that speaks to couples like us.

1005
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:09,430
<34-12,CASTLE>我俩都是主导型人格
<34-12,CASTLE>See, we're both alphas.

1006
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,710
<34-12,CASTLE>书上说  我们得一起给共同的生活空间下定义
<34-12,CASTLE>And it says that we need to define our shared territory together.

1007
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,960
<34-12,CASTLE>这些艺术品  讲述的都是我的故事
<34-12,CASTLE>These art pieces all over-- these are all my stories.

1008
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:19,690
<34-12,CASTLE>但这些贝壳  讲的是我们的
<34-12,CASTLE>But the shells? That's ours.

1009
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,770
<34-13,BECKETT>我喜欢我们的故事
<34-13,BECKETT>I like our story.

1010
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:22,450
<34-14,CASTLE>我也是
<34-14,CASTLE>Yeah, me, too.

1011
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:26,540
<34-15,CASTLE>这下糟了
<34-15,CASTLE>That can't be good.

1012
00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:29,720
<34-15,CASTLE>你得承认  这是我们自找的
<34-15,CASTLE>You have to admit that we brought this upon ourselves.

1013
00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:33,030
<34-16,BECKETT>真的假的
