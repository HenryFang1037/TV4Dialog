00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,780
<1-2,FARRAH DARWAZA>我们机长也是你的大粉丝呢
<1-2,FARRAH DARWAZA>You know, our pilot is also a huge fan.

7
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,610
<1-2,FARRAH DARWAZA>可以也为她签个名吗
<1-2,FARRAH DARWAZA>You think you could sign a book for her, too?

8
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,290
<1-3,CASTLE>十分乐意  我只求她
<1-3,CASTLE>I'd love to. All I ask in return is that

9
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:30,490
<1-3,CASTLE>安全送我们到希思罗机场
<1-3,CASTLE>she deliver us to Heathrow safely.

11
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:35,370
<1-6,CASTLE>谢谢
<1-6,CASTLE>Thank you.

12
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,720
<1-7,MAN>我被从指定的座位顶下来了
<1-7,MAN>I got bumped out of my assigned seat.

13
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:38,990
<1-7,MAN>你说你会想办法的
<1-7,MAN>You said you'd fix it.

14
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:40,810
<1-8,FARRAH>我说十分抱歉
<1-8,FARRAH>I said you had my apology.

15
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:43,190
<1-8,FARRAH>但这是头等舱唯一的座位了
<1-8,FARRAH>This is the only seat available in first.

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,610
<1-9,MAN>你知道我是谁吗
<1-9,MAN>Do you know who I am?

17
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,290
<1-10,ALEXIS CASTLE>我不知道他是谁  但我知道他是什么样的人
<1-10,ALEXIS CASTLE>I don't know who he is, but I know what he is...

18
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:48,110
<1-10,ALEXIS CASTLE>大混蛋
<1-10,ALEXIS CASTLE>A giant ass.

19
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,810
<1-12,ALEXIS>爸爸  你什么时候开始这么紧张坐飞机了
<1-12,ALEXIS>Dad, when did you become such a nervous flier?

20
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:59,210
<1-13,CASTLE>没有  我就是不喜欢气流
<1-13,CASTLE>I'm not. I just don't like turbulence...

22
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:01,600
<1-13,CASTLE>还有座舱压力骤降
<1-13,CASTLE>Or sudden drop in cabin pressure

23
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,650
<1-13,CASTLE>还有机械故障
<1-13,CASTLE>or mechanical problems

25
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,500
<1-13,CASTLE>还有坠机
<1-13,CASTLE>or crashing.

26
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:07,210
<1-13,CASTLE>不用担心
<1-13,CASTLE>There's nothing to worry about.

28
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:09,920
<1-14,ALEXIS>就是气流有点不稳而已
<1-14,ALEXIS>It's just a little bumpy air. That's all it is.

29
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,550
<1-15,CASTLE>气流就不该不稳
<1-15,CASTLE>Air, by nature, should not be bumpy.

31
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:13,950
<1-16,ALEXIS>看看乘务员
<1-16,ALEXIS>Just look at the flight crew.

32
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,420
<1-16,ALEXIS>只要他们还在走动  还在微笑  就没事
<1-16,ALEXIS>If they're up and smiling, then everything is fine.

33
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:22,460
<1-17,CASTLE>他们是还站着  但可没笑
<1-17,CASTLE>Yes, well, they're up, but they are not exactly smiling.

34
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:24,180
<1-18,ALEXIS>爸爸  航程很长
<1-18,ALEXIS>Dad, it's a long flight.

35
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,850
<1-18,ALEXIS>你得把注意力转移到别的地方
<1-18,ALEXIS>You should really focus on something else,

36
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:27,510
<1-18,ALEXIS>否则感觉只会更漫长
<1-18,ALEXIS>or it'll seem even longer...

37
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:28,620
<1-18,ALEXIS>我们都会很难熬
<1-18,ALEXIS>for both of us.

38
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,880
<1-19,CASTLE>好吧  我就不去理会死亡阴影了
<1-19,CASTLE>Fine. I shall ignore the grim specter of death

39
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,230
<1-19,CASTLE>只专注于我们的行程
<1-19,CASTLE>and focus... focus on our itinerary.

40
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:41,280
<1-19,CASTLE>好吧  车会去酒店接我们
<1-19,CASTLE>All right. Car is going to pick us up from the hotel,

41
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,300
<1-19,CASTLE>送我们去夏洛克·福尔摩斯协会
<1-19,CASTLE>whisk us off to the Sherlock Holmes Society,

42
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,670
<1-19,CASTLE>我将在那里跟各位推理作家同僚
<1-19,CASTLE>where I will speak to my fellow mystery writers about...

43
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,860
<1-20,ALEXIS>其实  我今晚有计划
<1-20,ALEXIS>Actually, I made plans for tonight.

44
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,160
<1-21,CASTLE>什么计划  跟谁啊
<1-21,CASTLE>W-- what plans? With who?

45
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,500
<1-22,ALEXIS>几个在伦敦做交换学生的朋友
<1-22,ALEXIS>Oh, some friends who are doing their semester abroad in London.

46
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,240
<1-22,ALEXIS>我们要在南肯辛顿一家酒吧见面
<1-22,ALEXIS>We're meeting a pub in South Ken.

47
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,990
<1-23,CASTLE>但夏洛克·福尔摩斯协会
<1-23,CASTLE>But the, um, Sherlock Holmes Society

48
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:00,370
<1-23,CASTLE>要在贝克街221号B集会啊
<1-23,CASTLE>is convening at 221B Baker Street.

49
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,030
<1-23,CASTLE>你不会想错过看夏洛克·福尔摩斯宅邸的机会吧
<1-23,CASTLE>You don't want to miss the actual home of Sherlock Holmes.

50
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,140
<1-24,ALEXIS>你知道他是个虚构人物吧
<1-24,ALEXIS>You do know he's fictional, right?

51
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,830
<1-25,CASTLE>但那地方是真的啊
<1-25,CASTLE>Yes, but his address is real.

52
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:08,610
<1-25,CASTLE>而且我还会讲话  如果你不在
<1-25,CASTLE>And I will be speaking, and if you're not there,

53
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,990
<1-25,CASTLE>-谁会为我骄傲啊  -我永远为你骄傲  爸爸
<1-25,CASTLE>- who will be proud of me? - I'm always proud of you, dad.

54
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:13,500
<1-26,ALEXIS>但我都听过你演讲无数次了
<1-26,ALEXIS>But I've heard you speak a million times.

55
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,860
<1-26,ALEXIS>我知道你会说什么
<1-26,ALEXIS>I know what you're gonna say.

56
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,400
<1-27,CASTLE>这可不可能
<1-27,CASTLE>That is improbable.

57
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,140
<1-28,ALEXIS>你会说你不相信作者会遇到瓶颈
<1-28,ALEXIS>You'll say you don't believe in writer's block,

58
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,200
<1-28,ALEXIS>你写第一部小说是为泡一个妹子
<1-28,ALEXIS>that you wrote your first novel to impress a girl.

59
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,400
<1-28,ALEXIS>拜读大作家的作品能给你灵感
<1-28,ALEXIS>That reading great writers inspires you,

60
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:23,900
<1-28,ALEXIS>而跟他们一起饮酒
<1-28,ALEXIS>and drinking with them inspires you

61
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,800
<1-28,ALEXIS>会激励你在畅销书榜单上把他们比下去
<1-28,ALEXIS>to beat them on the best-seller list.

62
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,000
<1-28,ALEXIS>好吧
<1-28,ALEXIS>Okay.

63
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,150
<1-29,CASTLE>显然我需要另找新的话题了
<1-29,CASTLE>Clearly I need to develop some new material.

64
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,010
<1-29,CASTLE>但这本来是
<1-29,CASTLE>But this was supposed to be

65
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:33,230
<1-29,CASTLE>传统的父女时光啊
<1-29,CASTLE>old-fashioned father-daughter time.

66
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:35,460
<1-30,ALEXIS>爸爸  看着你对你的朋友发表讲话
<1-30,ALEXIS>Dad, watching you speak to your cronies

67
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,330
<1-30,ALEXIS>算不上是父女时光
<1-30,ALEXIS>isn't exactly father-daughter time.

68
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:38,710
<1-30,ALEXIS>而且我也不是12了
<1-30,ALEXIS>Besides, I'm not 12.

69
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,410
<1-30,ALEXIS>我们不用时刻在一起
<1-30,ALEXIS>We don't have to be attached at the hip.

70
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,510
<1-31,CASTLE>好吧  死亡的阴影  又回来了
<1-31,CASTLE>Okay. That impending specter of death... it's back.

71
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,170
<1-32,CASTLE>贝克特  你怎么跑进去的
<1-32,CASTLE>Beckett. How did you get in there?

72
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,230
<1-33,KATE BECKETT>通过神奇的无线网络
<1-33,KATE BECKETT>Through the magic of WiFi.

73
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:54,770
<1-33,KATE BECKETT>我就猜到你会在上网
<1-33,KATE BECKETT>I figured you'd be online.

74
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,160
<1-33,KATE BECKETT>我觉得你会想知道最新进展
<1-33,KATE BECKETT>So I thought that you would want an update.

75
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,660
<1-33,KATE BECKETT>我们破案了  是赛车手
<1-33,KATE BECKETT>We solved the case. The race car driver did it.

76
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:01,580
<1-34,CASTLE>太好了
<1-34,CASTLE>That's good to hear.

77
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,320
<1-35,BECKETT>你那边没事吧
<1-35,BECKETT>Is everything okay up there?

78
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,950
<1-36,ALEXIS>就是遇到了点气流
<1-36,ALEXIS>Just a little turbulence.

79
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:12,050
<1-37,BECKETT>卡塞尔  有问题吗
<1-37,BECKETT>Castle, is something wrong?

80
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,120
<1-38,CASTLE>嗯  没事的
<1-38,CASTLE>Yeah... everything's gonna be just fine.

81
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,460
<2-1,JAVIER ESPOSITO>卡塞尔
<2-1,JAVIER ESPOSITO>Hey, Castle.

82
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,040
<2-1,JAVIER ESPOSITO>卡塞尔
<2-1,JAVIER ESPOSITO>Castle?

83
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:24,900
<2-2,BECKETT>只有我觉得这根本不叫"没事"吗
<2-2,BECKETT>Is it just me, or does everything not seem just fine?

84
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:25,890
<2-3,ESPOSITO>贝克特  放心
<2-3,ESPOSITO>Beckett, relax.

85
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:28,220
<2-3,ESPOSITO>就算气流再强烈  也不会把飞机搞下来
<2-3,ESPOSITO>Even the most heinous turbulence won't bring a plane down.

86
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,410
<2-4,KEVIN RYAN>而且每天有20趟航班飞离纽约
<2-4,KEVIN RYAN>And every day, 20 flights leave New York

87
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:31,950
<2-4,KEVIN RYAN>安全降落在伦敦
<2-4,KEVIN RYAN>and land in London without a problem.

88
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:34,300
<2-4,KEVIN RYAN>-卡塞尔的航班也不会有事  -是啊
<2-4,KEVIN RYAN>- It's gonna be the same for Castle's flight, too. - Yeah.

89
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:41,000
<3-1,CASTLE>没事的
<3-1,CASTLE>It's gonna be all right.

90
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,920
<3-2,ALEXIS>各位  这里是机长艾德蒙斯
<3-2,ALEXIS>Folks, this is Captain Edmunds.

91
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,060
<3-3,CAPTAIN EDMUNDS>之前遭遇了气流
<3-3,CAPTAIN EDMUNDS>We hit some chop there,

92
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,930
<3-3,CAPTAIN EDMUNDS>但我们已经攀升至3.9万英尺高空
<3-3,CAPTAIN EDMUNDS>but we've climbed to 39,000 feet

93
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:48,630
<3-3,CAPTAIN EDMUNDS>到希思罗机场应该不会再有颠簸了
<3-3,CAPTAIN EDMUNDS>and expect a smooth ride all the way to Heathrow.

94
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:51,030
<3-4,ALEXIS>瞧  根本不用担心
<3-4,ALEXIS>See? There's nothing to worry about.

95
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,480
<3-5,CASTLE>嗯
<3-5,CASTLE>Yeah.

96
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,950
<3-6,CASTLE>那他们怎么不笑呢
<3-6,CASTLE>Now why aren't they smiling?

97
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,390
<3-7,ALEXIS>爸爸  你听到机长的话了
<3-7,ALEXIS>Dad, you heard the pilot.

98
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:00,350
<3-8,CASTLE>我告诉你  不对劲
<3-8,CASTLE>I'm telling you, something is not right.

99
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:02,440
<3-8,CASTLE>我要去问个明白
<3-8,CASTLE>And I am going to find out what.

100
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:07,190
<3-9,CASTLE>打扰
<3-9,CASTLE>Excuse me.

101

<3-10,JIM KOGUT>先生  安全带警告灯还开着呢
<3-10,JIM KOGUT>Sir, the seat belt sign is still illuminated.

<3-10,JIM KOGUT>请回到你的座位上
<3-10,JIM KOGUT>If you could please return to your seat...

103
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,350
<3-11,CASTLE>你没笑  你们都没笑
<3-11,CASTLE>You're not smiling. None of you are smiling.

104
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,640
<3-11,CASTLE>机长也在这里  怎么回事啊
<3-11,CASTLE>And the captain's here? What's going on?

105
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,960
<3-11,CASTLE>出什么机械故障了吗
<3-11,CASTLE>Is there some kind of mechanical problem?

106
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,210
<3-12,JIM>-先生  请回去...  -吉姆  等等
<3-12,JIM>- Please, sir, just return... - Jim, wait. Um...

107
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,830
<3-13,FARRAH>或许他能帮上忙
<3-13,FARRAH>Maybe he can help.

108
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,700
<3-14,CAPTAIN EDMUNDS>卡塞尔先生  我是艾德蒙斯机长
<3-14,CAPTAIN EDMUNDS>Mr. Castle, I'm Captain Edmunds.

109
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,800
<3-14,CAPTAIN EDMUNDS>你跟纽约警局合作  是吗
<3-14,CAPTAIN EDMUNDS>You work with the N.Y.P.D., right?

110
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,990
<3-14,CAPTAIN EDMUNDS>我们需要你的协助
<3-14,CAPTAIN EDMUNDS>We could actually use your assistance.

111
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:28,890
<3-15,CASTLE>协助什么
<3-15,CASTLE>My assistance with what?

112
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,530
<3-16,CAPTAIN EDMUNDS>这是凯尔·福特
<3-16,CAPTAIN EDMUNDS>This is Kyle Ford.

113
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:33,280
<3-16,CAPTAIN EDMUNDS>他是本航班的空警
<3-16,CAPTAIN EDMUNDS>He's the air marshal on this flight.

114
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,130
<3-17,CASTLE>我见过他  他就坐在我那排
<3-17,CASTLE>I saw this guy. He's sitting in my row.

115
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:38,110
<3-17,CASTLE>至少  刚刚还在的
<3-17,CASTLE>He... at least, he was sitting in my row.

116
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,630
<3-17,CASTLE>这跟空警有什么关系
<3-17,CASTLE>What does this have to do with the air marshal?

117
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:42,440
<3-18,CAPTAIN EDMUNDS>一小时前  他向地面办事处发了短信
<3-18,CAPTAIN EDMUNDS>An hour ago, he sent a text to his field office

118
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,880
<3-18,CAPTAIN EDMUNDS>称本机上有安全隐患
<3-18,CAPTAIN EDMUNDS>about a security issue onboard this air craft.

119
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,650
<3-19,CASTLE>什么样的安全隐患
<3-19,CASTLE>What kind of security issue?

120
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:49,340
<3-20,CAPTAIN EDMUNDS>"大洋航空57号航班可能面临威胁
<3-20,CAPTAIN EDMUNDS>"Possible threat to Oceanic Air flight 57.

121
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,560
<3-20,CAPTAIN EDMUNDS>正在调查"
<3-20,CAPTAIN EDMUNDS>I'm investigating."

122
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,500
<3-20,CAPTAIN EDMUNDS>福特的短信里只说了这么多
<3-20,CAPTAIN EDMUNDS>That's all Ford said in his text.

123
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,690
<3-21,CASTLE>他跟你怎么说的
<3-21,CASTLE>And what did he tell you?

124
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:56,700
<3-22,CAPTAIN EDMUNDS>可惜的是  我没能跟他说上话
<3-22,CAPTAIN EDMUNDS>Unfortunately, I haven't been able to talk to him.

125
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,830
<3-22,CAPTAIN EDMUNDS>福特先生失踪了
<3-22,CAPTAIN EDMUNDS>Mr. Ford is missing.

126
00:04:58,830 --> 00:04:59,830
<3-23,CASTLE>失踪
<3-23,CASTLE>Missing?

127
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:02,970
<3-23,CASTLE>失踪了
<3-23,CASTLE>Missing?

128
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:06,070
<3-24,CASTLE>怎么可能  你们搜飞机了吗
<3-24,CASTLE>How could he be missing? Did you search the plane?

129
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,190
<3-25,DEBBIE PARKER>从头至尾
<3-25,DEBBIE PARKER>From front to back.

130
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:09,450
<3-26,CAPTAIN EDMUNDS>鉴于目前状况  我已接到命令
<3-26,CAPTAIN EDMUNDS>Given the circumstances, I've been instructed

131
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:12,480
<3-26,CAPTAIN EDMUNDS>把我自己锁进驾驶舱继续飞往希思罗机场
<3-26,CAPTAIN EDMUNDS>to lock myself in the cockpit and continue on to Heathrow.

132
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,390
<3-27,CASTLE>-恐怖主义应对机制  -没错
<3-27,CASTLE>- Terrorism protocol. - Precisely.

133
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:16,810
<3-28,CAPTAIN EDMUNDS>现在  空警行踪不明
<3-28,CAPTAIN EDMUNDS>Right now, with the air marshal unaccounted for,

134
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:18,220
<3-28,CAPTAIN EDMUNDS>你是飞机上
<3-28,CAPTAIN EDMUNDS>you're the closest thing we have

135
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,950
<3-28,CAPTAIN EDMUNDS>最接近执法人员的人了
<3-28,CAPTAIN EDMUNDS>to law enforcement on this plane.

136
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,950
<3-29,CASTLE>光这一点就够令人担忧了
<3-29,CASTLE>Which in itself is cause for concern.

137
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:24,030
<3-30,CAPTAIN EDMUNDS>你愿意帮助我们吗  卡塞尔先生
<3-30,CAPTAIN EDMUNDS>Will you help us, Mr. Castle?

138
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:26,450
<3-31,CASTLE>当然  我当然愿意
<3-31,CASTLE>Yeah. Yes. No, of course.

139
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:27,770
<3-31,CASTLE>当然  好吧
<3-31,CASTLE>Of course. Okay, um...

140
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:30,780
<3-31,CASTLE>你们搜查飞机时  都检查了哪些地方
<3-31,CASTLE>When you searched the plane, where did you look?

141
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,490
<3-32,FARRAH>-卫生间  厨房  -好的
<3-32,FARRAH>- Um, the restrooms, the galleys. - Good.

142
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:34,700
<3-34,JIM>-还有行李舱  -很好
<3-34,JIM>- Uh, cargo hold. - Great.

143
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,170
<3-35,CASTLE>包括行李架都检查了
<3-35,CASTLE>Even the overhead bins.

144
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,710
<3-37,CASTLE>可以确定福特先生在飞机上的某处
<3-37,CASTLE>Okay, well, Mr. Ford is on the plane somewhere.

145
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,560
<3-37,CASTLE>我们只能再检查一次了
<3-37,CASTLE>We just have to search again.

146
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,520
<3-37,CASTLE>也许  这次还是别检查行李架了
<3-37,CASTLE>Maybe... skip the overhead bins this time.

147
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,510
<4-1,DEBBIE>真不明白  就好像他凭空失踪了
<4-1,DEBBIE>I don't know. It's like he just disappeared.

148
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:59,260
<4-1,DEBBIE>根本讲不通啊  借过
<4-1,DEBBIE>It doesn't make sense. Excuse me.

149
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,850
<4-2,CASTLE>你了解那位空警吗
<4-2,CASTLE>How well do you know the air marshal?

150
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,520
<4-3,DEBBIE>不太了解
<4-3,DEBBIE>Not that well.

151
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,230
<4-3,DEBBIE>福特先生一个月就跟我们飞两次
<4-3,DEBBIE>Mr. Ford only flies with us like twice a month.

152
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,930
<4-3,DEBBIE>他很专业  讲礼貌  这里
<4-3,DEBBIE>He's very professional, very polite. There you go.

153
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,380
<4-3,DEBBIE>好的  这里
<4-3,DEBBIE>Okay. This...

154
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:11,770
<4-4,DEBBIE>是唯一一处
<4-4,DEBBIE>Is the only other place

155
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,950
<4-4,DEBBIE>我们还没进行二次搜索的地方
<4-4,DEBBIE>we haven't given a second look.

156
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,250
<5-1,CASTLE>福特知道怎么下来吗
<5-1,CASTLE>Does Ford know how to get down here?

157
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,600
<5-2,DEBBIE>当然  他和我们一样也能进入所有区域
<5-2,DEBBIE>Of course. He has access to the entire plane, just like we do.

158
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,200
<5-3,CASTLE>和机身等长  所有地方都找过了吗
<5-3,CASTLE>Runs the length of the plane. And you looked everywhere?

159
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,810
<5-3,CASTLE>我们并没有把所有行李取出来
<5-3,CASTLE>Well, we didn't pull out all the luggage

160
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:32,590
<5-4,DEBBIE>因为当时并没有发现下面有人
<5-4,DEBBIE>'cause there was no sign anyone was down here.

161
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,250
<5-5,CASTLE>这倒霉的飞机上有条蛇哎
<5-5,CASTLE>There's a snake on the mother-flyin' plane.

162
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,320
<5-6,DEBBIE>没遇上上周随机运送的斗牛犬
<5-6,DEBBIE>You're lucky it wasn't the pit bulls

163
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,040
<5-6,DEBBIE>算你走运了
<5-6,DEBBIE>we had to ship last week.

164
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,570
<5-7,CASTLE>看看这个行李
<5-7,CASTLE>Look at this luggage.

165
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,390
<5-7,CASTLE>什么时候允许衣物
<5-7,CASTLE>Since when does the airline allow

166
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,190
<5-7,CASTLE>露在行李箱外面了
<5-7,CASTLE>clothes hanging out of bags?

167
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,750
<5-8,DEBBIE>一般不允许的
<5-8,DEBBIE>They don't, not usually.

168
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,480
<5-9,CASTLE>三个不同的行李箱
<5-9,CASTLE>That's three different bags...

169
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,180
<5-9,CASTLE>分别属于三位乘客
<5-9,CASTLE>from three different passengers.

170
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,750
<5-9,CASTLE>这没道理
<5-9,CASTLE>That doesn't make any sense.

171
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,540
<5-10,DEBBIE>-除非  -除非什么
<5-10,DEBBIE>- Unless... - Unless what?

172
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:08,550
<5-11,CASTLE>除非是有人把另一个箱子的东西取了出来
<5-11,CASTLE>Unless someone took the clothes out of another suitcase,

173
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,810
<5-11,CASTLE>塞进了这三个箱子里
<5-11,CASTLE>stuffed them into those three bags.

174
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:13,610
<5-12,DEBBIE>你不会是认为
<5-12,DEBBIE>You don't think...

175
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:15,010
<5-13,CASTLE>只有打开看看才知道了
<5-13,CASTLE>One way to find out.

176
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:23,950
<5-13,CASTLE>我的天哪
<5-13,CASTLE>Oh, my god.

177
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:25,960
<5-14,DEBBIE>那是福特空警
<5-14,DEBBIE>That's air marshal Ford.

187
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:38,580
<6-1,BECKETT>不会吧  空警死了
<6-1,BECKETT>You've got to be kidding me. The air marshal is dead?

188
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:42,570
<6-2,CASTLE>不仅死了  而且头部遭受重击  被杀
<6-2,CASTLE>Not just dead, but bonked on the head, murdered.

189
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:43,720
<6-3,BECKETT>而且还有呢
<6-3,BECKETT>And there's more.

190
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,390
<6-3,BECKETT>还有
<6-3,BECKETT>There's more?

191
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:48,800
<6-4,CASTLE>凯尔·福特的枪套是空的  枪不见了
<6-4,CASTLE>Kyle Ford's holster is empty. His gun is missing.

192
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,510
<6-5,BECKETT>好吧  那么可以认定凶手持有武器
<6-5,BECKETT>Okay, so, uh, we have to assume that the killer is armed.

193
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:54,300
<6-6,CASTLE>而且他们可能还有下一步计划
<6-6,CASTLE>And they may have another agenda --

194
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,790
<6-6,CASTLE>挟持人质  劫持飞机
<6-6,CASTLE>taking hostages, hijacking the plane.

195
00:07:56,950 --> 00:08:00,090
<6-6,CASTLE>说清楚  这绝非我要的轻松伦敦之旅
<6-6,CASTLE>F.Y.I., this is not the relaxing London getaway I had planned.

196
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:01,490
<6-7,BECKETT>这事还有谁知道
<6-7,BECKETT>So who else knows about this?

197
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:03,680
<6-8,CASTLE>机组人员  空警
<6-8,CASTLE>Well, just the flight crew, the air marshal service,

198
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,870
<6-8,CASTLE>还有联调局
<6-8,CASTLE>and the F.B.I.

199
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:06,070
<6-9,BECKETT>我能帮什么忙
<6-9,BECKETT>And how can I help?

200
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:08,030
<6-10,CASTLE>他们给了我一份乘客名单
<6-10,CASTLE>Uh, they gave me a copy of the flight manifest.

201
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:10,000
<6-10,CASTLE>我邮件给你了  现在应该到了
<6-10,CASTLE>I e-mailed it to you. You should have that by now.

202
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,950
<6-11,BECKETT>好的  我会和联调局合作
<6-11,BECKETT>Good. I'll coordinate with the F.B.I.

203
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,300
<6-11,BECKETT>开始查找有不良记录的乘客
<6-11,BECKETT>And start running names to look for red flags.

204
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,680
<6-11,BECKETT>你没事吧
<6-11,BECKETT>Are you okay?

205
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:19,110
<6-12,CASTLE>阿丽克西斯也在航班上
<6-12,CASTLE>Alex is on this flight,

206
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:21,280
<6-12,CASTLE>还有其他近两百名乘客
<6-12,CASTLE>along with almost 200 other people.

207
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:25,310
<6-13,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你能做到的
<6-13,BECKETT>Castle... you can do this.

208
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:27,840
<6-14,CASTLE>做到什么  我该做什么  抓凶手吗
<6-14,CASTLE>Do what? What am I supposed to do, catch the killer?

209
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,990
<6-14,CASTLE>凶手可能是任何人  都不知道从哪下手
<6-14,CASTLE>It could be anyone. I wouldn't know where to start.

210
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:31,260
<6-15,BECKETT>从头开始
<6-15,BECKETT>You start at the beginning.

211
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,950
<6-15,BECKETT>建立死者的时间线
<6-15,BECKETT>We build a timeline for our victim,

212
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:34,750
<6-15,BECKETT>和以往的第一步一样
<6-15,BECKETT>same first step we always take.

213
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,110
<6-15,BECKETT>是啊
<6-15,BECKETT>Right.

214
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:38,220
<6-16,CASTLE>只是  这次  这第一步是
<6-16,CASTLE>I just -- this time, that first step is...

215
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:40,000
<6-16,CASTLE>在一万两千米的高空上
<6-16,CASTLE>39,000 feet off the ground.

216
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,750
<6-17,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我会陪着你
<6-17,BECKETT>Castle, I'm gonna be here with you.

217
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,500
<6-17,BECKETT>在地上想办法破这个案子
<6-17,BECKETT>I'll be working this case from the ground,

218
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,900
<6-17,BECKETT>和大家一起
<6-17,BECKETT>along with the boys.

00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,670
<6-18,CASTLE>好的  谢谢
<6-18,CASTLE>Okay. Thank you.

220
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,780
<6-18,CASTLE>我能破案的
<6-18,CASTLE>I can figure this out.

221
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,230
<6-19,BECKETT>我知道
<6-19,BECKETT>I know you can.

222
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,160
<6-20,DEBBIE>抱歉  小姐  这里乘客不能进入
<6-20,DEBBIE>I am sorry, miss. This area is off-limits.

<6-21,CASTLE>她是和我一起的
<6-21,CASTLE>Oh, she's -- that's -- she's with me.

<6-21,CASTLE>她是我女儿  她是...
<6-21,CASTLE>That's my daughter, and she's...

225
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,210
<6-22,ALEXIS>你走了好久  我很担心
<6-22,ALEXIS>You were gone so long, I got worried.

226
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,050
<6-22,ALEXIS>你在这儿干什么呢
<6-22,ALEXIS>Why are you down here?

227
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,350
<6-23,CASTLE>我待会儿打给你  爱你
<6-23,CASTLE>Uh, I'll call you later. I love you.

228
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:05,700
<7-1,BECKETT>我也爱你
<7-1,BECKETT>I love you, too.

229
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,550
<7-2,RYAN>一直喜欢歪心狼
<7-2,RYAN>Always rooting for that Coyote,

230
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:08,300
<7-3,ESPOSITO>-不喜欢BB鸟  -就是
<7-3,ESPOSITO>- not the Road Runner. - Right.

231
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,330
<7-4,BECKETT>两位
<7-4,BECKETT>Guys?

232
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,490
<7-4,BECKETT>我需要你们的帮助
<7-4,BECKETT>I need your help.

233
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,870
<8-1,ALEXIS>你觉得可能是谁干的
<8-1,ALEXIS>Who do you think could have done it?

234
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:16,740
<8-2,CASTLE>这正是我想解决的问题
<8-2,CASTLE>Well, that's what I'm gonna try to figure out.

235
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,370
<8-3,ALEXIS>怎么做
<8-3,ALEXIS>How?

236
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:20,450
<8-3,ALEXIS>和机组人员一起重现福特的行动
<8-3,ALEXIS>By reconstructing Ford's movements with the flight crew.

237
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,440
<8-4,CASTLE>同时  我需要你不要声张
<8-4,CASTLE>In the meantime, I need you to keep this to yourself

238
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,470
<8-4,CASTLE>回上面安全的机舱去
<8-4,CASTLE>and go back upstairs where it's safer.

239
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:27,570
<8-5,ALEXIS>那儿就安全吗  凶手不是在那儿吗
<8-5,ALEXIS>How is it safer? Isn't that where the killer is?

240
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,640
<8-6,CASTLE>我只是不想让你卷进来
<8-6,CASTLE>Look, I just don't want you to be a part of this.

241
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,540
<8-7,ALEXIS>我已经卷进来了  我能帮忙的  爸爸
<8-7,ALEXIS>I'm already part of it. I can help, dad.

242
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,290
<8-7,ALEXIS>我还当过蕾妮的实习生呢  记得吗
<8-7,ALEXIS>I interned with Lanie, remember?

243
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,800
<8-7,ALEXIS>我可以检查尸体找线索
<8-7,ALEXIS>I'll check the body for clues.

244
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,800
<8-8,CASTLE>阿丽克西斯
<8-8,CASTLE>Well, A-Alexis --

245
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,950
<8-9,ALEXIS>这飞机上有个杀人犯
<8-9,ALEXIS>There's a killer on this plane.

246
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,220
<8-9,ALEXIS>我们还不知道他是谁  想干什么
<8-9,ALEXIS>We don't know what he's planning or who he is,

247
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,430
<8-9,ALEXIS>也许我能帮上忙呢
<8-9,ALEXIS>and maybe I can do something about that.

248
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:48,190
<8-9,ALEXIS>我不会回座位的
<8-9,ALEXIS>I am not going back to my seat.

249
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:50,990
<8-10,CASTLE>哪怕意味着我们要时刻在一起吗
<8-10,CASTLE>Even if it means us being joined at the hip?

250
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,510
<8-10,CASTLE>真的假的啊
<8-10,CASTLE>Really?

251
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:54,120
<8-11,ALEXIS>这种时候你还拿这话还击我
<8-11,ALEXIS>You're throwing that back at me now?

252
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,190
<8-12,CASTLE>无话可说了吧
<8-12,CASTLE>Right in your face.

253
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:57,050
<8-13,ALEXIS>我开始检查了
<8-13,ALEXIS>I'll get started here.

254
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:58,230
<8-13,ALEXIS>你去跟机组人员合作
<8-13,ALEXIS>You go talk to the flight crew

255
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:00,150
<8-13,ALEXIS>-想办法找到凶手  -好的
<8-13,ALEXIS>- and try to figure out who did this. - Right.

256
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:03,730
<9-1,JIM>凶手就在外面
<9-1,JIM>It was someone out there.

257
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,350
<9-1,JIM>这些人中的一个杀害了凯尔·福特
<9-1,JIM>One of those people killed Kyle Ford.

258
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:09,630
<9-2,FARRAH>我刚刚告诉了其他空乘
<9-2,FARRAH>I just told the other flight attendants.

259
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,000
<9-2,FARRAH>我还是不敢相信
<9-2,FARRAH>I still can't believe this.

260
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,790
<9-3,DEBBIE>现在怎么办  卡塞尔先生
<9-3,DEBBIE>What do we do now, Mr. Castle?

261
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,410
<9-4,CASTLE>现在我们想办法拼凑出
<9-4,CASTLE>Well, now we try to piece together

262
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:17,710
<9-4,CASTLE>被害者死前在哪里  和谁说过话
<9-4,CASTLE>where the victim was and who he had contact with before he died.

263
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,640
<9-4,CASTLE>你们最后一次看到福特空警
<9-4,CASTLE>When was the last time anyone remembers

264
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,840
<9-4,CASTLE>是什么时间
<9-4,CASTLE>seeing air Marshal Ford?

265
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,520
<9-5,FARRAH>-谁在酒水服务时招待的他  -是我
<9-5,FARRAH>- Wait, who served him during drink service? - I did.

266
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,690
<9-7,CASTLE>这是早上八点半的航班
<9-7,CASTLE>Okay, this was an 8:30 AM flight.

267
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:26,860
<9-7,CASTLE>酒水服务时什么时候
<9-7,CASTLE>Drink service occurred when?

268
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:27,940
<9-8,DEBBIE>是十点钟开始的
<9-8,DEBBIE>Uh, we start at 10:00.

269
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:30,000
<9-9,FARRAH>等我回收垃圾的时候
<9-9,FARRAH>And by the time I did the trash pickup,

270
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,650
<9-9,FARRAH>福特就不在他的位子上了  不见了
<9-9,FARRAH>Ford wasn't in his seat. He was gone.

271
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,990
<9-10,JIM>没有不见  我在用餐时间看到他了
<9-10,JIM>Not gone. I noticed him during meal service

272
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:36,070
<9-10,JIM>-在靠近机尾的地方  -他在做什么
<9-10,JIM>- near the back of the plane. - Doing what?

273
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:38,210
<9-12,JIM>我没看到  一位乘客缠住了我
<9-12,JIM>Oh, I didn't see because a passenger got in my face

274
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:39,300
<9-12,JIM>抱怨食物很糟糕
<9-12,JIM>about the lousy food.

275
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,940
<9-12,JIM>我们最近为了省钱改了供应商...
<9-12,JIM>We recently switched vendors to save money --

276
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,420
<9-13,CASTLE>我...你什么时候看到他的
<9-13,CASTLE>I -- when you saw him,

277
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,360
<9-13,CASTLE>他是在第一过道还是第二过道
<9-13,CASTLE>was he in aisle 1 or aisle 2?

278
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,810
<9-14,DEBBIE>如果是用餐时间的话
<9-14,DEBBIE>If it was meal service,

279
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:48,660
<9-14,DEBBIE>过道一是被餐车堵住的...
<9-14,DEBBIE>aisle 1 is blocked by the cart --

280
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,370
<9-15,CASTLE>那就是第二过道  什么时间呢
<9-15,CASTLE>So aisle 2. What time was that?

281
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,670
<9-16,JIM>快到十一点的时候
<9-16,JIM>Just before 11:00.

282
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:54,370
<9-17,CASTLE>我们是在11:35的时候发现尸体的
<9-17,CASTLE>And we found the body at 11:35,

283
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:57,450
<9-17,CASTLE>这样在他被杀之前有个约35分钟的空当
<9-17,CASTLE>giving us about a 35-minute window before he was killed.

284
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:59,900
<9-17,CASTLE>还有其他人看到他在飞机尾部了吗
<9-17,CASTLE>Does anyone else remember seeing him at the back of the plane?

285
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,290
<9-17,CASTLE>他有和其他人一起吗
<9-17,CASTLE>Was he with someone?

286
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,480
<9-18,DEBBIE>加油  伙计们  努力想
<9-18,DEBBIE>Come on, you guys, try to remember.

287
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,190
<9-19,FARRAH>也许可以问坐在后面的乘客有没有看到他
<9-19,FARRAH>Maybe we can ask the passengers in back if they saw him.

288
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:07,990
<9-20,CASTLE>不行  如果这样做了
<9-20,CASTLE>No, if we did that,

289
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:09,260
<9-20,CASTLE>乘客们就会知道有什么不对劲了
<9-20,CASTLE>word would get out something is wrong,

290
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:11,130
<9-20,CASTLE>说不定凶手也就知道了
<9-20,CASTLE>Word that could make it back to the killer.

291
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,230
<9-21,CASTLE>也许还有其他的办法
<9-21,CASTLE>Maybe there's another way

292
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:17,860
<9-21,CASTLE>能知道福特在过道后部做什么
<9-21,CASTLE>To know what Ford was doing at the back of this aisle.

293
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,780
<9-21,CASTLE>那两位先生这样自拍了多久了
<9-21,CASTLE>How long have those two gentlemen been taking selfies?

294
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,000
<9-22,JIM>度蜜月的那对
<9-22,JIM>The honeymooners?

295
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,390
<9-22,JIM>喝完第一杯酒就开始了  他们很有爱
<9-22,JIM>Since their first Pimm's cup. They're adorable.

296
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,650
<9-23,CASTLE>我得和他们聊聊
<9-23,CASTLE>I have to talk to them.

297
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,370
<9-24,DEBBIE>我们要做什么
<9-24,DEBBIE>What should we do?

298
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:29,120
<9-25,CASTLE>你们的任务最艰巨了
<9-25,CASTLE>You have the hardest job of all.

299
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:31,230
<9-25,CASTLE>假装什么事都没有发生
<9-25,CASTLE>Pretend like everything's normal.

300
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,570
<10-1,CHRIS>我觉得接下来的旅程
<10-1,CHRIS>I think for the rest of the trip

301
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:34,850
<10-1,CHRIS>我们都应该像这样说话
<10-1,CHRIS>we should talk like this.

302
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:36,130
<10-2,HUSBAND>真是优雅
<10-2,HUSBAND>So posh.

303
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:38,740
<10-2,HUSBAND>英音的"自拍"怎么说
<10-2,HUSBAND>How do you say "selfie" in British?

304
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,270
<10-2,HUSBAND>自帕
<10-2,HUSBAND>Sew-fee!

305
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,640
<10-4,HUSBAND>像索菲似的
<10-4,HUSBAND>Sophie?

306
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,880
<10-5,CASTLE>要不我来帮你们俩好好拍一张吧
<10-5,CASTLE>Why don't I grab a proper picture of the two of you?

307
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,310
<10-6,CHRIS>-太好了  谢谢  -没问题
<10-6,CHRIS>- Oh, great, thanks. - You bet.

308
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,460
<10-8,CASTLE>准备好
<10-8,CASTLE>Here we go.

309
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:55,130
<10-9,HUSBAND>能快点吗  我都快笑僵了
<10-9,HUSBAND>Can you hurry up? My face is hurting.

310
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:57,140
<10-10,CASTLE>好了  再来一张
<10-10,CASTLE>Right. One more for safety.

311
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,480
<10-10,CASTLE>好的
<10-10,CASTLE>Okay.

312
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,060
<10-11,CASTLE>你俩是怎么认识的
<10-11,CASTLE>So how did you guys meet?

313
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:02,750
<10-12,CHRIS>那可是很长的故事
<10-12,CHRIS>It's kind of a long story.

314
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,110
<10-13,CASTLE>我最喜欢听长故事了
<10-13,CASTLE>I love long stories.

315
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:06,150
<10-13,CASTLE>我的天
<10-13,CASTLE>Oh, god...

316
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:08,500
<11-1,LANIE PARISH>你要处理这种事真是糟糕  亲爱的
<11-1,LANIE PARISH>It's awful what you're dealing with, sweetie.

317
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,710
<11-2,ALEXIS>非常感谢你的帮忙  蕾妮
<11-2,ALEXIS>Thanks for your help, Lanie.

318
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:12,910
<11-3,LANIE>客气什么  我真希望还能帮上更多的忙
<11-3,LANIE>Are you kidding? I just wish there was more I could do.

319
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,950
<11-3,LANIE>我会指导你一步步做的  放心
<11-3,LANIE>I'm gonna talk you through this, all right?

320
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:17,110
<11-4,ALEXIS>你想先看看头部的伤口吗
<11-4,ALEXIS>Do you want to see the head wound first?

321
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:20,370
<11-5,LANIE>好的  不过你得凑得非常近才行
<11-5,LANIE>Yeah, but you're gonna need to get in really close.

322
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,580
<11-6,LANIE>试试把头发往后面拨一点
<11-6,LANIE>Try moving the hair back a little.

323
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:36,370
<11-6,LANIE>这样就好了
<11-6,LANIE>Yeah, there we go.

324
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:38,160
<11-7,ALEXIS>你能看出他是被什么击中的吗
<11-7,ALEXIS>Can you tell what he was hit with?

325
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,850
<11-8,LANIE>很难说  一个长条形的  比如管子
<11-8,LANIE>Mm, it's hard to say. Something oblong. A pipe, maybe.

326
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,460
<11-9,ALEXIS>我的天
<11-9,ALEXIS>Oh, man.

327
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,900
<11-10,LANIE>阿丽克西斯你还好吗
<11-10,LANIE>Alexis, are you all right?

328
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,320
<11-10,LANIE>只不过是一具尸体罢了
<11-10,LANIE>It's just another body.

329
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,540
<11-10,LANIE>你之前经历过很多次了
<11-10,LANIE>You've done this plenty of times before.

330
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,410
<11-11,ALEXIS>我不是因为这个尸体而难受
<11-11,ALEXIS>It's not the body I'm worried about.

331
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:54,850
<11-11,ALEXIS>是那个杀了他还偷走他的枪的人
<11-11,ALEXIS>It's the person who killed him and took his gun.

332
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:57,030
<11-12,LANIE>看了这个伤口  关于凶手
<11-12,LANIE>And looking at this, there is something

333
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:59,570
<11-12,LANIE>我能说出点有用的东西了
<11-12,LANIE>I can tell you about who that person is.

334
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,180
<12-1,ALEXIS>爸爸...
<12-1,ALEXIS>Dad...

335
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:07,910
<12-2,CASTLE>蕾妮发现了什么吗
<12-2,CASTLE>Lanie find something?

336
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:10,370
<12-3,ALEXIS>没有搏斗的迹象  看上去像是
<12-3,ALEXIS>No sign of a struggle, but it looks like

337
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:12,640
<12-3,ALEXIS>福特因脑后遭到一记重击而死...
<12-3,ALEXIS>Ford died from a single blow to the back of the head --

338
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,290
<12-3,ALEXIS>伤口在左侧颅顶骨
<12-3,ALEXIS>The left parietal bone.

339
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:16,930
<12-4,CASTLE>那凶手一定是突然袭击他的
<12-4,CASTLE>So the killer must have caught him by surprise.

340
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,750
<12-5,ALEXIS>更重要的消息是根据伤口的角度来看
<12-5,ALEXIS>The bigger news is that the angle of the blow

341
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,100
<12-5,ALEXIS>凶手是个左撇子
<12-5,ALEXIS>indicates that whoever did this was left-handed.

342
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,410
<12-6,CASTLE>从统计学的角度来说  这样就排除了
<12-6,CASTLE>Statistically speaking, that rules out

343
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:25,690
<12-6,CASTLE>飞机上的大部分人  干得好
<12-6,CASTLE>most everyone on the plane. Good work.

344
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:29,860
<12-7,ALEXIS>那对同性恋夫夫  他们是嫌犯
<12-7,ALEXIS>The...gay couple? Are they suspects?

345
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,230
<12-8,CASTLE>不  应该不是他们
<12-8,CASTLE>Nah, I really doubt it.

346
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,810
<12-9,ALEXIS>那你怎么会有他们的自拍照
<12-9,ALEXIS>Then why do you have their selfies?

347
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:34,940
<12-10,CASTLE>我把照片从他们手机上电邮了过来
<12-10,CASTLE>Well, I e-mailed them to myself off their phone.

348
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,670
<12-10,CASTLE>说来话长
<12-10,CASTLE>It's a long story.

349
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:39,000
<12-10,CASTLE>都快和他们如何相识的故事一样长了
<12-10,CASTLE>Almost as long as the one about how they met.

350
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:41,140
<12-10,CASTLE>但他们拍照的时候
<12-10,CASTLE>But they take these near the time

351
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,890
<12-10,CASTLE>正好是空警福特在机尾的那段时间
<12-10,CASTLE>Air Marshal Ford was at the back of the plane.

352
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:44,260
<12-10,CASTLE>我希望他会和凶手一起
<12-10,CASTLE>I was hoping he'd show up in one of them

353
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:46,000
<12-10,CASTLE>出现在某张照片里  可惜不走运
<12-10,CASTLE>along with the killer, but no luck.

354
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,080
<12-11,ALEXIS>视频里也没有吗
<12-11,ALEXIS>Not even in the video?

355
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,010
<12-12,CASTLE>我还没来得及看这个呢
<12-12,CASTLE>Actually, I didn't check out that one.

356
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,340
<12-13,CHRIS>大家好
<12-13,CHRIS>Hello!

357
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,280
<12-15,CHRIS>我们结婚了
<12-15,CHRIS>We did it!

358
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,980
<12-16,CASTLE>看后面  他就在那里
<12-16,CASTLE>In the background. There he is.

359
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,010
<12-16,CASTLE>那是福特
<12-16,CASTLE>That's Ford.

360
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:58,990
<12-17,ALEXIS>不过他是一个人
<12-17,ALEXIS>But he's not with anybody.

361
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:02,060
<12-17,ALEXIS>他在查看顶部行李箱
<12-17,ALEXIS>He was checking the overhead bin.

362
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,650
<12-18,CASTLE>不过在找什么呢  不是他的包
<12-18,CASTLE>Yeah, but for what? Not his own bag.

363
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:05,150
<12-18,CASTLE>他是和我们一起在头等舱的
<12-18,CASTLE>He was up here in first with us.

364
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,280
<12-19,ALEXIS>再播放一遍
<12-19,ALEXIS>Let's play it again.

365
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,940
<12-20,CASTLE>说不定里面有什么
<12-20,CASTLE>Maybe something's in there.

366
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:12,760
<12-20,CASTLE>福特说他在调查一个可能的威胁
<12-20,CASTLE>Ford says he was onto a possible threat.

367
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:14,780
<12-21,ALEXIS>不过他根本没在往里面看
<12-21,ALEXIS>But he's not even looking inside.

368
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:19,200
<12-22,CASTLE>因为那个行李架就是个幌子
<12-22,CASTLE>Because the overhead bin is a ruse.

369
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,520
<12-22,CASTLE>你看福特一直在略过肩膀看别的地方
<12-22,CASTLE>See how Ford is glancing over his shoulder?

370
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,550
<12-22,CASTLE>-他在观察什么人  -你说得对
<12-22,CASTLE>- He's clocking someone. - You're right.

371
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,400
<12-23,ALEXIS>是这家伙
<12-23,ALEXIS>It's this guy, uh...

372
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,530
<12-24,CASTLE>26B
<12-24,CASTLE>26B.

373
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,170
<12-23,ALEXIS>看
<12-23,ALEXIS>And look.

374
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:30,920
<12-23,ALEXIS>他发现福特在看他了
<12-23,ALEXIS>He realizes Ford is watching him.

375
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:34,560
<12-24,CASTLE>26B  26B...
<12-24,CASTLE>26B, 26B...

376
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:36,010
<12-24,CASTLE>伊萨多·巴尔顿
<12-24,CASTLE>Isadore Baldon.

377
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:39,530
<13-1,BECKETT>伊萨多·巴尔顿  25岁  来自布鲁克林
<13-1,BECKETT>Isadore Baldon, 25, of Brooklyn.

378
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:41,100
<13-1,BECKETT>没有犯罪记录  但是...
<13-1,BECKETT>No criminal record, but...

379
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,410
<13-1,BECKETT>有麻烦了  卡塞尔
<13-1,BECKETT>We have a problem, Castle.

380
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:44,530
<13-2,CASTLE>什么样的麻烦
<13-2,CASTLE>What's the problem?

381
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,960
<13-3,BECKETT>他和你描述的那个人不一样
<13-3,BECKETT>He doesn't match the man that you described.

382
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:50,360
<13-3,BECKETT>我们联系上了巴尔顿  他还在市里呢
<13-3,BECKETT>We contacted Baldon. He's actually here in town.

383
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:52,840
<13-3,BECKETT>他的护照好几周之前被偷了
<13-3,BECKETT>His passport was stolen weeks ago.

384
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:55,780
<13-3,BECKETT>坐在26B的那个人  绝对不是伊萨多·巴尔顿
<13-3,BECKETT>Whoever is sitting in 26B, it's not Isadore Baldon.

385
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,490
<13-4,CASTLE>也许这就是福特一直留意他的原因
<13-4,CASTLE>Oh, maybe that's why Ford was watching him.

386
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:58,630
<13-4,CASTLE>他发现了他偷护照
<13-4,CASTLE>He got onto that somehow.

387
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:00,730
<13-5,BECKETT>不久之后福特就被杀了
<13-5,BECKETT>And then moments later Ford was murdered.

388
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:03,450
<13-6,CASTLE>我想我们找到凶手了
<13-6,CASTLE>I think we found our killer.

389
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,020
<14-1,FARRAH>他在干什么
<14-1,FARRAH>What's he doing?

390
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,360
<14-2,CASTLE>大汗淋漓  他很紧张
<14-2,CASTLE>Sweating bullets. He's nervous.

391
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,560
<14-3,JIM>他当然很紧张  他杀了凯尔·福特
<14-3,JIM>Of course he's nervous. He just killed Kyle Ford.

392
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,870
<14-4,FARRAH>还不能确定  吉姆
<14-4,FARRAH>We don't know that, Jim.

393
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,960
<14-4,FARRAH>他用偷来的护照坐飞机
<14-4,FARRAH>He's flying on a stolen passport.

394
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,880
<14-5,JIM>还要求坐在靠近行李舱的后排
<14-5,JIM>He requested a seat in the back near the cargo hold.

395
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,650
<14-5,JIM>你们看过视频了
<14-5,JIM>You saw the video.

396
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:33,070
<14-5,JIM>福特当时在监视他  现在却死了
<14-5,JIM>Ford was watching him, and now he's dead.

397
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:35,180
<14-5,JIM>黛比  你难道不认为
<14-5,JIM>Debbie, you can't tell me he doesn't meet the criteria

398
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:37,300
<14-5,JIM>他对乘客和机组人员构成威胁了吗
<14-5,JIM>for posing a threat to passengers and crew.

399
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:39,260
<14-6,DEBBIE>不  他当然是威胁  在这种情况下
<14-6,DEBBIE>No, he definitely does. Under the circumstances,

400
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,370
<14-6,DEBBIE>我们有权拘捕他
<14-6,DEBBIE>we're empowered to detain him,

401
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:42,060
<14-6,DEBBIE>而且我们受过这种训练
<14-6,DEBBIE>and we have the training to do so.

402
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:44,200
<14-7,CASTLE>我觉得你们不该这么做  现在还不行
<14-7,CASTLE>I don't think you should, not just yet.

403
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,760
<14-8,DEBBIE>你不需要对飞机上的人负责
<14-8,DEBBIE>Well, you're not responsible for the people on this plane.

404
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,400
<14-8,DEBBIE>但我们需要
<14-8,DEBBIE>We are.

405
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,740
<14-9,FARRAH>是的  而且如果是他的话  他可是有枪的
<14-9,FARRAH>Yeah. And if he did it, he has a gun.

406
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,480
<14-10,JIM>而我  不想等到他开枪再去拦他
<14-10,JIM>And I, for one, don't want to wait for him to start shooting it.

407
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,280
<14-11,CASTLE>可如果他不是我们要找的人怎么办
<14-11,CASTLE>And what if he's not our guy?

408
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,180
<14-11,CASTLE>你去把他拿下
<14-11,CASTLE>You go out there and take him down,

409
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:58,310
<14-11,CASTLE>人们会开始惊慌  真正的凶手就警觉了
<14-11,CASTLE>It'll start a panic, alert the real killer,

410
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:00,570
<14-11,CASTLE>那他可能还是会开枪
<14-11,CASTLE>and he may pull a gun anyway.

411
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:02,260
<14-12,DEBBIE>好吧  那你有什么提议
<14-12,DEBBIE>Okay, so what do you propose?

412
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,800
<14-13,CASTLE>我们要确认他的身份
<14-13,CASTLE>We need to identify him,

413
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,190
<14-13,CASTLE>搞明白我们对付的人是谁
<14-13,CASTLE>figure out who it is we're dealing with.

414
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,530
<14-13,CASTLE>是不是又要送饮料了
<14-13,CASTLE>Isn't it about time for another drink service?

415
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:11,500
<14-14,JIM>本该是的  可是航空公司削减预算
<14-14,JIM>It would be, except for that the airline's cut back,

416
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,470
<14-14,JIM>-所以我们只能...  -吉姆  吉姆
<14-14,JIM>- so now we're only allowed... - Jim. Jim.

417
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,540
<14-15,CASTLE>我付钱
<14-15,CASTLE>My treat.

418
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:19,000
<15-1,FARRAH>有垃圾吗
<15-1,FARRAH>Trash?

419
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,150
<15-1,FARRAH>谢谢
<15-1,FARRAH>Thank you.

420
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:23,040
<15-1,FARRAH>非常感谢
<15-1,FARRAH>Thank you very much.

421
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,230
<15-2,FARRAH>要我收走吗  先生
<15-2,FARRAH>Can I take that for you, sir?

422
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,490
<15-3,FARRAH>非常感谢
<15-3,FARRAH>Thank you so much.

423
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:55,990
<15-4,CASTLE>做得好  法拉
<15-4,CASTLE>Well played, Farrah.

424
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,660
<15-5,FARRAH>现在怎么做
<15-5,FARRAH>What are we doing now?

425
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:01,080
<15-6,ALEXIS>他用自动铅笔的铅粉充当取指纹粉末
<15-6,ALEXIS>He's using the graphite from his mechanical pencil to make fingerprint powder.

426
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,170
<15-7,CASTLE>我在《百战天龙》里看过
<15-7,CASTLE>I saw this on "MacGyver" once.

427
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:04,220
<15-7,CASTLE>我还见过李察·狄恩·安德森[主演]
<15-7,CASTLE>Well, I actually met Richard Dean Anderson.

428
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,410
<15-8,ALEXIS>-你知道他说什么吗  -能先干正事吗
<15-8,ALEXIS>- You know what he said? - Can you please do it already?

429
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:06,810
<15-9,CASTLE>-说得对  -谢谢
<15-9,CASTLE>- Right. - Thank you.

430
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,250
<15-10,FARRAH>真的有用
<15-10,FARRAH>It's actually working.

431
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,790
<15-11,CASTLE>太好了
<15-11,CASTLE>Sweet.

432
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,670
<16-1,TORY ELLIS>我在联调局的数据库里找到了匹配
<16-1,TORY ELLIS>I got a hit off the f.B.I. database.

433
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:28,320
<16-3,TORY>-艾曼·哈达德  -他是叙利亚人
<16-3,TORY>- Aiman Haddad. - He's a Syrian national in the U.S.

434
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:31,000
<16-3,TORY>凭学生签证来到美国  就读于哈德逊大学
<16-3,TORY>on a student visa, enrolled at Hudson University.

435
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:32,120
<16-3,TORY>24岁
<16-3,TORY>24 years old.

436
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,440
<16-4,BECKETT>等一下  如果他是合法入境  那为什么
<16-4,BECKETT>Wait, if he's here legally, then why would he be

437
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,160
<16-4,BECKETT>要用偷来的护照坐飞机呢
<16-4,BECKETT>traveling on a stolen passport?

438
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,090
<16-5,TORY>可能是因为联调局把他列在了禁飞名单上
<16-5,TORY>It might be because the f.B.I. has him on the no-fly list.

439
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:40,120
<16-6,BECKETT>什么原因
<16-6,BECKETT>For what reason?

440
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:43,450
<16-7,TORY>显然艾曼·哈达德跟伊斯兰国有关
<16-7,TORY>Apparently Aiman Haddad is affiliated with I.S.I.S.

441
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:44,810
<16-8,BECKETT>他是恐怖分子吗
<16-8,BECKETT>He's a terrorist?

442
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:47,990
<16-9,ESPOSITO>还有更糟的  我跟哈达德哈德逊大学的室友谈过
<16-9,ESPOSITO>It gets worse. I just talked to Haddad's roommate at Hudson.

443
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:50,100
<16-9,ESPOSITO>他说哈达德最近对宗教非常痴迷
<16-9,ESPOSITO>He said that Haddad had recently become super religious

444
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,090
<16-9,ESPOSITO>而且把他的东西全都卖了  室友问他为什么
<16-9,ESPOSITO>and sold all of his stuff, and when the roommate asked why,

445
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:55,020
<16-9,ESPOSITO>哈达德说他不再需要这些东西了
<16-9,ESPOSITO>Haddad said that he wasn't going to be needing it anymore.

446
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,060
<16-10,BECKETT>我们得告诉卡塞尔
<16-10,BECKETT>We got to tell Castle.

447
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:01,910
<17-1,CASTLE>好的  谢谢你告诉我
<17-1,CASTLE>Yeah. Thank you for letting me know.

448
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,480
<17-1,CASTLE>我一会儿再打给你
<17-1,CASTLE>I'll call you later.

449
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,600
<17-2,ALEXIS>怎么了  贝克特怎么说
<17-2,ALEXIS>What is it? What did Beckett say?

450
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:10,210
<17-3,CASTLE>你回到头等舱去
<17-3,CASTLE>I want you to go back to first class.

451
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:11,790
<17-3,CASTLE>在那儿等着我去找你
<17-3,CASTLE>Stay there until I tell you.

452
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,720
<17-4,ALEXIS>好的
<17-4,ALEXIS>Okay.

453
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:16,360
<17-5,ALEXIS>-小心点  老爸  -好的
<17-5,ALEXIS>- Be careful, dad. - Okay.

454
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,190
<17-6,DEBBIE>这么说他是坏人了
<17-6,DEBBIE>I take it he's a bad guy.

455
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:25,830
<17-7,CASTLE>他在禁飞名单上  而且禁飞的理由很充足
<17-7,CASTLE>He's on the no-fly list, and for good reason.

456
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,540
<17-9,FARRAH>-这么说他是恐怖分子  -天哪
<17-9,FARRAH>- So he's a terrorist. - Oh, my God.

457
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,290
<17-10,CASTLE>他杀死了空警
<17-10,CASTLE>He murdered the air marshal.

458
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:31,390
<17-10,CASTLE>能够做出这么大胆的行为
<17-10,CASTLE>Now that is a bold act committed by someone

459
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:34,050
<17-10,CASTLE>说明他已经不在乎飞机降落后自己会被抓
<17-10,CASTLE>not concerned with what happens to him once the plane lands.

460
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,770
<17-11,JIM>因为这架飞机可能根本不会降落
<17-11,JIM>Because maybe the plane won't be landing.

461
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:37,660
<17-12,CASTLE>我觉得我们可以做最坏的打算
<17-12,CASTLE>I think we can assume the worst.

462
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:40,290
<17-12,CASTLE>假设他的计划不仅是杀死凯尔·福特
<17-12,CASTLE>Assume that his plan is bigger than killing Kyle Ford.

463
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:41,490
<17-13,DEBBIE>好的  我们知道该怎么做
<17-13,DEBBIE>Okay, we know what to do.

464
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:43,450
<17-13,DEBBIE>首先  要尽可能把他隔离开
<17-13,DEBBIE>First, we isolate him if possible.

465
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:45,320
<17-14,JIM>我会控制住他的双手  这样他就不能拿枪了
<17-14,JIM>I'll control his hands so he doesn't go for the gun

466
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,820
<17-14,JIM>或者其它危险品
<17-14,JIM>or something worse.

467
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,340
<17-15,FARRAH>我去拿束线带把他捆住
<17-15,FARRAH>I'll get the zip ties to secure him.

468
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:50,920
<17-16,CASTLE>很好  你们也说了  我们得悄悄地做这些
<17-16,CASTLE>Good, and like you said, I think we should do this quietly.

469
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,930
<17-16,CASTLE>想办法让他离开座位
<17-16,CASTLE>Try to get him out of his seat

470
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:54,620
<17-16,CASTLE>并且远离其他乘客
<17-16,CASTLE>and away from the other passengers.

471
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,380
<17-17,DEBBIE>我可以广播让他到飞机后部的厨房
<17-17,DEBBIE>I could page him back to the rear galley.

472
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,590
<17-18,CASTLE>他可能会起疑心  这样太冒险了
<17-18,CASTLE>He might get suspicious. That's too risky.

473
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:00,710
<17-18,CASTLE>如果他意识到我们要控制住他
<17-18,CASTLE>If he realizes we're trying to take him down,

474
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:02,740
<17-18,CASTLE>他可能会狗急跳墙
<17-18,CASTLE>he may do something desperate.

475
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,750
<17-19,MARILYN>你在干什么啊
<17-19,MARILYN>Hey, what are you doing?

476
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:11,360
<17-19,MARILYN>怎么了
<17-19,MARILYN>What's going on?

477
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:17,570
<17-20,CASTLE>把门打开
<17-20,CASTLE>Open the door!

478
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:18,890
<17-20,CASTLE>把门打开
<17-20,CASTLE>Open the door!

479
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,540
<17-21,CASTLE>你能听懂他在说什么吗
<17-21,CASTLE>Can you understand what he's saying?

480
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,310
<17-22,CASTLE>是谁  你在跟谁通话
<17-22,CASTLE>Who is that? Who are you talking to?

481
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:32,870
<17-22,CASTLE>你说了什么
<17-22,CASTLE>What were you saying?!

482
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:36,000
<17-23,CASTLE>他说了什么
<17-23,CASTLE>What was he saying?

483
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:39,780
<17-24,FARRAH>他说"他们知道了  很快一切就会结束"
<17-24,FARRAH>He said, "They know, and it'll all be over soon."

484
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:49,730
<18-1,ESPOSITO>贝克特  我刚跟国土安全部通过电话
<18-1,ESPOSITO>Yo, Beckett, I just got off with homeland security.

485
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,050
<18-1,ESPOSITO>哈达德拨的那个电话号码
<18-1,ESPOSITO>The number that Haddad was calling

486
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:52,600
<18-1,ESPOSITO>是叙利亚的一部手机
<18-1,ESPOSITO>was traced to his Syrian mobile account.

487
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,710
<18-2,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你听见了吗
<18-2,BECKETT>Castle, did you hear that?

488
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:55,380
<18-3,CASTLE>是的  知道他是打给谁了吗
<18-3,CASTLE>Yeah. Do we know who he was calling?

489
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:57,110
<18-4,ESPOSITO>不知道  国务院正在跟
<18-4,ESPOSITO>No. State's trying to coordinate

490
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,670
<18-4,ESPOSITO>叙利亚政府协商  不过他们
<18-4,ESPOSITO>with the Syrian government, but they're not expecting

491
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:00,050
<18-4,ESPOSITO>一般不会配合
<18-4,ESPOSITO>any kind of cooperation.

492
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,610
<18-5,AIMAN HADDAD>你们搞错了
<18-5,AIMAN HADDAD>You are making a mistake!

493
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,230
<18-5,AIMAN HADDAD>我有权利
<18-5,AIMAN HADDAD>I have rights!

494
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:04,790
<18-6,DEBBIE>我们检查了他的座位
<18-6,DEBBIE>Okay, we checked his seat

495
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:06,760
<18-6,DEBBIE>还有他的行李  没有发现枪
<18-6,DEBBIE>and his carry-on, and there's no sign of a gun.

496
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,050
<18-7,CASTLE>贝克特  找不到枪
<18-7,CASTLE>Beckett, we can't find the gun.

497
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:09,430
<18-8,BECKETT>他可能藏在什么地方了
<18-8,BECKETT>Well, he might have hidden it somewhere.

498
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:11,400
<18-8,BECKETT>或者他在飞机上还有同伙
<18-8,BECKETT>Or he has a partner who is onboard.

499
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,590
<18-8,BECKETT>无论如何  卡塞尔  你都要审讯他
<18-8,BECKETT>Either way, Castle, you're gonna have to interrogate him.

500
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:14,830
<18-9,CASTLE>我
<18-9,CASTLE>Me?

501
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:17,330
<18-10,BECKETT>你都跟我一起审讯过上百次了
<18-10,BECKETT>You've been with me in hundreds of interrogations.

502
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:19,460
<18-11,CASTLE>是的  可那时并没有关系到我的生命
<18-11,CASTLE>Yeah, just never when my life depended on it,

503
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:21,020
<18-11,CASTLE>或者其他人的生命
<18-11,CASTLE>along with everyone else's.

504
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:23,090
<18-12,RYAN>各位  我还有坏消息
<18-12,RYAN>Hey, guys, I have more bad news.

505
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:24,730
<18-12,RYAN>航空公司说
<18-12,RYAN>According to the airline,

506
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:26,490
<18-12,RYAN>哈达德还带了一个经过检查的包上了飞机
<18-12,RYAN>Haddad has a checked bag on the flight.

507
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:29,010
<18-12,RYAN>联调局希望你们能找到  并搜查一下
<18-12,RYAN>F.B.I. needs you to locate and search it.

508
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:30,720
<18-13,CASTLE>真好  那要是发现什么呢
<18-13,CASTLE>Great. And if we find something?

509
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,390
<18-14,ESPOSITO>如果是爆炸装置
<18-14,ESPOSITO>In the event there's an explosive device,

510
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:33,850
<18-14,ESPOSITO>拆弹组会告诉你怎么做的
<18-14,ESPOSITO>the bomb squad will talk you through it.

511
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,360
<18-15,CASTLE>我们要找到他的行李
<18-15,CASTLE>We need to find his luggage.

<18-16,JIM>-我跟你去找  -不不  你和法拉
<18-16,JIM>- I'll go with you. - No, no, no. I need you and Farrah

<18-17,DEBBIE>到上面去让大家保持冷静
<18-17,DEBBIE>upstairs keeping things calm.

514
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,500
<18-17,DEBBIE>很多乘客在询问情况
<18-17,DEBBIE>The passengers are starting to ask questions.

515
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,430
<18-18,JIM>你怎么跟他们说的
<18-18,JIM>What did you tell them?

516
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:44,940
<18-19,DEBBIE>一位男士喝了太多的酒
<18-19,DEBBIE>That a gentleman had too much to drink,

517
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,340
<18-19,DEBBIE>不过我不确定他们是否相信
<18-19,DEBBIE>but I'm not sure they believed me.

518
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:49,740
<18-20,ALEXIS>我去  越快找到  我们就越安全
<18-20,ALEXIS>I'll go. The faster we find it, the safer we'll be.

00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,830
<18-21,CASTLE>祝我好运
<18-21,CASTLE>Wish me luck.

521
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:56,390
<18-22,BECKETT>不用靠运气  你已经做了无数次了
<18-22,BECKETT>You don't need it. You've done this a million times.

522
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:58,330
<18-23,CASTLE>有发现就告诉你
<18-23,CASTLE>I'll let you know if I find anything.

523
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:01,450
<18-24,HADDAD>拜托  这完全是个可怕的误会
<18-24,HADDAD>Please. This is all a terrible mistake.

524
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:02,530
<18-25,CASTLE>你叫什么名字
<18-25,CASTLE>What's your name?

<18-26,HADDAD>伊萨多·巴尔顿
<18-26,HADDAD>Isadore Baldon.

526
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:05,740
<18-27,CASTLE>也许应该重来一遍
<18-27,CASTLE>Maybe we should try this again.

527
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:08,280
<18-27,CASTLE>我们知道你是艾曼·哈达德
<18-27,CASTLE>We know you are Aiman Haddad

528
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:10,420
<18-27,CASTLE>而且你和伊斯兰国有密切联系
<18-27,CASTLE>and that you have ties with I.S.I.S.

529
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:13,420
<18-27,CASTLE>你的计划是什么  谁是你的同伙
<18-27,CASTLE>Now what is your plan, and who are you working with?

530
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,130
<18-28,HADDAD>我不知道你在说什么
<18-28,HADDAD>I don't know what you're talking about.

531
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,810
<18-28,HADDAD>"他们知道了  很快一切就会结束"
<18-28,HADDAD>"They know, and it'll all be over soon."

532
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,680
<18-29,CASTLE>那是你刚才在手机上说的话
<18-29,CASTLE>That's what you said upstairs on the phone.

533
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,060
<18-29,CASTLE>你在跟谁通话
<18-29,CASTLE>So who were you talking to?

534
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:25,180
<18-30,HADDAD>既然你不会相信我
<18-30,HADDAD>Why should I answer

535
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,710
<18-30,HADDAD>我为什么还要回答你
<18-30,HADDAD>when I can see you won't believe me?

536
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:31,450
<19-1,DEBBIE>从这进去
<19-1,DEBBIE>Through here.

537
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,170
<19-2,ALEXIS>类似事件以前发生过吗
<19-2,ALEXIS>Anything like this ever happen on a flight before?

538
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:36,750
<19-3,DEBBIE>我经历的最接近的一次是
<19-3,DEBBIE>Closest I came was a 90-year-old

539
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,250
<19-3,DEBBIE>一位90岁的老人犯心脏病
<19-3,DEBBIE>who had a heart attack.

540
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,510
<19-3,DEBBIE>幸运的是  那次事故结局很圆满
<19-3,DEBBIE>Luckily, that one had a happy ending.

541
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:42,350
<19-4,ALEXIS>-这次也会的  -是吗
<19-4,ALEXIS>- This one will, too. - Yeah?

542
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:43,690
<19-4,ALEXIS>你做这行多久了
<19-4,ALEXIS>How long have you been doing this?

543
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:46,640
<19-5,DEBBIE>30年  还以为已经见过所有的...
<19-5,DEBBIE>30 years. Thought I'd seen it all --

544
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,940
<19-5,DEBBIE>每一个疯狂的乘客  每一个国家
<19-5,DEBBIE>Every crazy passenger, every country.

545
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:51,720
<19-5,DEBBIE>却遇上了这事
<19-5,DEBBIE>Now this.

546
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,840
<19-6,ALEXIS>如果有人能解决此事  非我爸爸莫属
<19-6,ALEXIS>If anyone can figure it out, my dad can.

547
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:55,700
<19-7,DEBBIE>真庆幸他在这趟航班上
<19-7,DEBBIE>Good thing he's on this flight.

548
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,550
<19-7,DEBBIE>你有这样的家庭真幸运
<19-7,DEBBIE>You're lucky to have family like that.

549
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,070
<19-8,ALEXIS>是的  是很幸运
<19-8,ALEXIS>Yeah. I guess I am.

550
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:01,090
<19-8,ALEXIS>你呢  有孩子吗
<19-8,ALEXIS>What about you? You have kids?

551
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:04,330
<19-9,DEBBIE>该怎么说呢  我总是在天上飞
<19-9,DEBBIE>Ah, what can I say? I was always up in the air.

552
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:10,020
<19-9,DEBBIE>找到了  伊萨多·巴尔顿  这是他的包
<19-9,DEBBIE>Got it. Isadore Baldon. This is his bag.

553
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,330
<20-1,CASTLE>我不是警察  也不是空警
<20-1,CASTLE>Now, I'm not a cop, and I'm not an air marshal,

554
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,830
<20-1,CASTLE>但我会搞清楚你在图谋些什么
<20-1,CASTLE>but I'm gonna find out what you're up to.

555
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:28,780
<20-1,CASTLE>你知道为什么吗
<20-1,CASTLE>Do you know why?

556
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,780
<20-2,CASTLE>因为我女儿在这架飞机上
<20-2,CASTLE>Because my daughter is on this plane,

557
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:37,940
<20-2,CASTLE>我不会让任何意外发生在她身上的
<20-2,CASTLE>and I'm not going to let anything happen to her.

558
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,420
<20-3,HADDAD>我不是恐怖分子
<20-3,HADDAD>I am not a terrorist.

559
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,730
<20-4,CASTLE>禁飞名单上有你的名字
<20-4,CASTLE>You're on the no-fly list.

560
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:43,400
<20-5,HADDAD>都是因为我那该死的表兄决定加入伊斯兰国
<20-5,HADDAD>Only because my idiot cousin decided to join I.S.I.S.

561
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,140
<20-6,CASTLE>你用偷来的护照上的飞机
<20-6,CASTLE>You're flying on a stolen passport.

562
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,800
<20-7,HADDAD>用真名我没法出行
<20-7,HADDAD>I couldn't travel under my own name,

563
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,190
<20-7,HADDAD>除此之外我还能怎么办
<20-7,HADDAD>so how else should I fly?

564
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:51,300
<20-8,CASTLE>为什么那么着急要坐飞机呢
<20-8,CASTLE>Why the sudden urgency to fly in the first place?

565
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,190
<20-9,HADDAD>我必须回叙利亚
<20-9,HADDAD>I need to go back to Syria.

566
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:55,810
<20-10,CASTLE>为什么  你的任务是什么
<20-10,CASTLE>Why? What's your mission?

567
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:56,710
<20-11,HADDAD>什么任务
<20-11,HADDAD>My mission?

<20-11,HADDAD>我必须回家
<20-11,HADDAD>I have to go home.

569
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:02,910
<20-11,HADDAD>我母亲病得很重  胰腺癌
<20-11,HADDAD>My mother is very sick. Pancreatic cancer.

570
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:04,670
<20-11,HADDAD>我向运输安全管理局作出申请
<20-11,HADDAD>I petitioned the T.S.A.

571
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:06,800
<20-11,HADDAD>我尝试了正规途径
<20-11,HADDAD>I went through the proper channels.

572
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:09,190
<20-11,HADDAD>但现在她只有几周的生命了
<20-11,HADDAD>But now she only has a few weeks to live.

573
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:11,900
<20-11,HADDAD>我在电话里就是跟她在讲话
<20-11,HADDAD>She is the one I was talking to on the phone.

574
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,800
<20-12,CASTLE>解释一下这个
<20-12,CASTLE>Explain this.

575
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:17,210
<20-12,CASTLE>那个空警一直盯着你
<20-12,CASTLE>See how the air marshal is staring right at you?

576
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:18,970
<20-13,HADDAD>他是空警吗
<20-13,HADDAD>He's the air marshal?

577
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,960
<20-14,HADDAD>他看出我很紧张  是不是
<20-14,HADDAD>He saw I was nervous, didn't he?

578
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,900
<20-14,HADDAD>就是因为他我才被扣留的吗
<20-14,HADDAD>Is he the reason I'm being detained?

579
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,180
<20-15,CASTLE>是的  可以这样说
<20-15,CASTLE>Yeah, you might say that.

580
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,550
<20-15,CASTLE>他发现你图谋不轨
<20-15,CASTLE>He realized you were up to something,

581
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,880
<20-15,CASTLE>所以你跟着他到了飞机尾部
<20-15,CASTLE>so you followed him to the back of the plane

582
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:32,070
<20-15,CASTLE>然后你杀了他
<20-15,CASTLE>and you killed him.

583
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:35,430
<20-16,HADDAD>杀了他  你什么意思
<20-16,HADDAD>Killed him? What do you mean?

584
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:36,910
<20-17,CASTLE>我们就在那里发现他的
<20-17,CASTLE>We found him right over there.

585
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,010
<20-18,HADDAD>不不不  其实是
<20-18,HADDAD>No. No, no, no, no, no! No, no! In fact,

586
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:44,810
<20-18,HADDAD>几秒钟后  这个人接到了许多短信
<20-18,HADDAD>seconds after that, this man got numerous texts on his phone

587
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:47,230
<20-18,HADDAD>然后他开始回信息  然后他就跑开了
<20-18,HADDAD>and then began texting back, and then he rushed off.

588
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:49,730
<20-18,HADDAD>那是我最后一次见他
<20-18,HADDAD>Look, this is the last I saw of him.

589
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,620
<20-19,CASTLE>他的手机在我们这  哈达德
<20-19,CASTLE>We have his phone, Haddad.

590
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,780
<20-19,CASTLE>他只发了一条短信
<20-19,CASTLE>He only sent one text.

591
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,370
<20-20,HADDAD>不  我知道自己看见了什么
<20-20,HADDAD>No, I know what I saw.

592
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:59,690
<20-20,HADDAD>他接到了一堆短信  至少有五条
<20-20,HADDAD>He got a bunch of texts, five at least.

593
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,090
<20-20,HADDAD>爸爸
<20-20,HADDAD>Dad?

594
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:03,060
<20-21,ALEXIS>能出来一下吗
<20-21,ALEXIS>Could I see you for a second?

595
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:10,790
<21-1,CASTLE>有发现吗
<21-1,CASTLE>Anything?

596
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:12,740
<21-2,ALEXIS>我们查看了他的行李
<21-2,ALEXIS>We checked his luggage.

597
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,770
<21-2,ALEXIS>没有枪  没有炸弹
<21-2,ALEXIS>No gun, no device,

598
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:16,410
<21-2,ALEXIS>没有任何证明他是恐怖分子的东西
<21-2,ALEXIS>nothing that speaks to terrorism.

599
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,790
<21-2,ALEXIS>政府无法证实他母亲生病的说辞
<21-2,ALEXIS>Look, state can't confirm the story about the sick mother,

600
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:25,980
<22-1,BECKETT>但哈达德的部分说辞被证实了
<22-1,BECKETT>but part of Haddad's story checks out.

601
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,490
<22-2,ESPOSITO>原来那个空警福特
<22-2,ESPOSITO>Turns out that air marshal Ford

602
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:29,190
<22-2,ESPOSITO>在飞机上还有另一部手机
<22-2,ESPOSITO>had a second phone on the flight.

603
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:30,660
<22-3,RYAN>是他的私人电话
<22-3,RYAN>It was his personal cell.

604
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,080
<22-4,CASTLE>尸体上没找到另一部手机
<22-4,CASTLE>Well, we didn't find a second phone on the body.

605
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,120
<22-5,BECKETT>如果上面有证据  很可能
<22-5,BECKETT>Well, if it had evidence on it, it's possible

606
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,640
<22-5,BECKETT>已经被凶手拿走了
<22-5,BECKETT>the killer removed it.

607
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,930
<22-6,CASTLE>没有手机的情况下可以调取他的短信吗
<22-6,CASTLE>Can we recover his texts without the phone?

608
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:40,830
<22-7,RYAN>可以  不过需要花费些时间
<22-7,RYAN>Yeah, but it's gonna take some time

609
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:42,690
<22-7,RYAN>才能让手机公司发给我们
<22-7,RYAN>to get the phone company to release them.

610
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:44,330
<22-8,CASTLE>可现在我们没那么多时间
<22-8,CASTLE>And time is something we don't have.

611
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,690
<22-9,BECKETT>这些事没法洗清哈达德的嫌疑
<22-9,BECKETT>And none of this clears Haddad.

612
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:47,310
<22-9,BECKETT>这些可能都是障眼法
<22-9,BECKETT>This could all be a smokescreen.

613
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,460
<22-10,ESPOSITO>让我们去追踪一些虚无的线索
<22-10,ESPOSITO>Something for us to chase

614
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:49,840
<22-10,ESPOSITO>从而掩盖他真实的计划
<22-10,ESPOSITO>while his real plan unfolds.

615
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,270
<22-11,CASTLE>我们需要那部手机
<22-11,CASTLE>We need that phone.

616
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:54,330
<22-11,CASTLE>如果福特在发短信的话  他一定连接了
<22-11,CASTLE>If Ford was texting, he must have been connected

617
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:55,660
<22-11,CASTLE>飞机上的无线网络
<22-11,CASTLE>to the plane's WiFi.

618
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:58,140
<22-12,RYAN>也就是说那部手机可能还在联网
<22-12,RYAN>Which means the phone may still be connected.

619
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:00,530
<22-13,CASTLE>好  那托瑞能不能用
<22-13,CASTLE>Right. So can Tory ping his cell

620
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:04,040
<22-13,CASTLE>"找到我的用户"那个应用  让手机响
<22-13,CASTLE>using the "Find my users" App, make it beep?

621
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,360
<22-13,CASTLE>好了  我进去了
<22-13,CASTLE>Okay, I'm in.

622
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,670
<23-1,TORY>我已经把他的号码连接到应用上了
<23-1,TORY>I've linked his number into the app.

623
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:09,870
<23-1,TORY>等你准备好就发出信号
<23-1,TORY>Ready to ping when you are.

624
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,260
<23-2,CASTLE>好  就位了
<23-2,CASTLE>Okay, stand by.

625
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,220
<23-2,CASTLE>好了  大家都准备好了吗
<23-2,CASTLE>All right, everyone ready?

626

<23-3,DEBBIE>Ready. Farrah and I are in coach,

<23-3,DEBBIE>吉姆在头等舱
<23-3,DEBBIE>and Jim is in first class.

628
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:21,820
<23-4,CASTLE>注意看有没有人看手机
<23-4,CASTLE>Watch for anyone reaching for their phone.

629
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:24,490
<23-4,CASTLE>福特的手机可能就在凶手的手里
<23-4,CASTLE>Ford's phone could be in the killer's hands.

630
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:27,860
<23-5,DEBBIE>好的
<23-5,DEBBIE>Okay.

631
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:28,940
<23-6,CASTLE>行动
<23-6,CASTLE>Go.

632
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:30,450
<23-7,TORY>信号发出
<23-7,TORY>Pinging now.

633
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,670
<23-8,FARRAH>在那里
<23-8,FARRAH>Over there.

634
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,150
<23-8,FARRAH>错误警报
<23-8,FARRAH>False alarm.

635
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:50,470
<23-9,ALEXIS>你听见什么声音了吗
<23-9,ALEXIS>Do you hear anything?

636
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,050
<23-10,CASTLE>如果有人取出电池
<23-10,CASTLE>If someone removed the battery

637
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:56,250
<23-10,CASTLE>或者关机  托瑞就没法...
<23-10,CASTLE>or even turned it off, Tory's not gonna be able --

638
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,590
<23-11,CASTLE>我有发现
<23-11,CASTLE>I have something.

639
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:00,790

<23-13,CASTLE>- How long does it take a snake to pass a -- - There it is.

643
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,790
<23-15,CASTLE>谢天谢地
<23-15,CASTLE>Oh, thank god. Okay.

644
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,090
<23-16,CASTLE>手机锁了  我们需要解锁密码
<23-16,CASTLE>It's locked. We need his pass code.

645
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:28,190
<23-17,ALEXIS>或者他的指纹
<23-17,ALEXIS>Or his fingerprint.

646
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,260
<23-18,CASTLE>真的非常抱歉
<23-18,CASTLE>I am...so sorry about this,

<23-18,CASTLE>感谢你为国家做出的贡献
<23-18,CASTLE>and thank you for your service to our country.

648
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,360
<23-18,CASTLE>好了
<23-18,CASTLE>Okay.

649
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:42,650
<23-19,ALEXIS>上面说了什么
<23-19,ALEXIS>What's it say?

650
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:45,340
<23-20,CASTLE>上面有很多短信
<23-20,CASTLE>It's got at least a dozen texts on here.

651
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:47,020
<23-21,HADDAD>你看吧  我告诉过你
<23-21,HADDAD>You see? I told you.

652
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:50,900
<23-22,CASTLE>-帅哥  想找点乐子吗  -你是谁
<23-22,CASTLE>- "Hey, sexy, wanna have some fun?" - "Who is this?"

653
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,060
<23-23,ALEXIS>到后面来找我你就知道了
<23-23,ALEXIS>"Meet me in the back of the plane and find out."

654
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:55,070
<23-24,CASTLE>但他们不愿意表明身份
<23-24,CASTLE>But then when they refuse to reveal their identity,

655
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:56,220
<23-24,CASTLE>福特不愿意见面
<23-24,CASTLE>Ford won't meet.

656
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:57,870
<23-25,ALEXIS>看  短信开始有敌意了
<23-25,ALEXIS>Look. The texts start to get hostile.

657
00:26:57,870 --> 00:27:00,430
<23-26,CASTLE>照我说的做  否则你就麻烦了
<23-26,CASTLE>"Do what I say, or you'll have a situation on your hands."

658
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:03,400
<23-28,CASTLE>-什么麻烦  -就是雇你来阻止的麻烦
<23-28,CASTLE>- "What kind of situation?" - "The kind you're hired to prevent."

659
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:05,660
<23-29,ALEXIS>威胁飞机安全是联邦刑事犯罪
<23-29,ALEXIS>"It's a federal offense to threaten an aircraft."

660
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:07,030
<23-30,CASTLE>如果我坚持到底
<23-30,CASTLE>"It's not a threat if I follow through

661
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:08,870
<23-30,CASTLE>并且让飞机坠毁  就不是威胁了
<23-30,CASTLE>and take down this plane."

662
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:12,420
<23-31,ALEXIS>幕后黑手不管是谁  还在飞机上
<23-31,ALEXIS>Whoever's behind this is still on the plane.

663
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:19,350
<24-2,BECKETT>-贝克特  我有线索了  -别挂电话
<24-2,BECKETT>- Beckett, I've got something. Yeah, hold on.

664
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:21,130
<24-3,TORY>空警手机上的短信
<24-3,TORY>Those texts on the Marshal's phone, they were sent

665
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:22,330
<24-3,TORY>是一部预付费手机发来的
<24-3,TORY>from a pre-paid cell.

666
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:23,130
<24-4,BECKETT>你能查到吗
<24-4,BECKETT>Can you trace it?

667
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,700
<24-5,TORY>不能  手机好像关机了
<24-5,TORY>No, it looks like it's been turned off.

668
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,250
<24-6,BECKETT>查一下手机号  看能不能找到
<24-6,BECKETT>Okay, run down that number. See if you can find out

669
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:28,570
<24-6,BECKETT>是谁在哪里买到的  卡塞尔
<24-6,BECKETT>who bought it and from where. Castle?

670
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:30,550
<24-7,BECKETT>-你还在吗  -是的  我在
<24-7,BECKETT>- You still there? - Yeah, I'm here.

671
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:32,530
<24-7,BECKETT>幕后黑手肯定有所准备
<24-7,BECKETT>Whoever's behind this did their homework.

672
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:33,740
<25-1,CASTLE>他们有福特的私人电话
<25-1,CASTLE>They had Ford's personal number

673
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:35,830
<25-1,CASTLE>也知道如何操控他
<25-1,CASTLE>and they knew exactly how to manipulate him.

674
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:37,360
<25-1,CASTLE>他们肯定认识他
<25-1,CASTLE>They must have known him somehow.

675
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,060
<25-2,BECKETT>我已经让他们去查福特的一切
<25-2,BECKETT>I've got the boys digging into Ford's life --

676
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,640
<25-2,BECKETT>财物  行踪  电话记录
<25-2,BECKETT>Financials, movements, phone records.

677
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,000
<25-2,BECKETT>他们在找线索看能不能把他和
<25-2,BECKETT>They're looking for anything that'll connect him

678
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,090
<25-2,BECKETT>这架航班上的什么人联系起来
<25-2,BECKETT>to someone on that flight.

679
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:44,600
<25-3,CASTLE>好的  让他们查快一点
<25-3,CASTLE>Well, tell them to dig a little faster

680
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:47,260
<25-3,CASTLE>在发短信的人把威胁变成现实之前
<25-3,CASTLE>before our texter makes good on his threat to take us down.

681
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:50,170
<25-4,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我
<25-4,BECKETT>Castle, I...

682
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,080
<25-5,CASTLE>我知道  我也是
<25-5,CASTLE>I know. Me, too.

683
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,320
<25-5,CASTLE>有线索了就给我打电话
<25-5,CASTLE>Call me when you have something.

684
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:55,990
<25-6,BECKETT>好的
<25-6,BECKETT>Okay.

685
00:27:57,230 --> 00:28:00,190
<25-7,ALEXIS>我们不能干坐着等分局的消息
<25-7,ALEXIS>We can't just sit around and wait for word from the precinct.

686
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:01,790
<25-7,ALEXIS>肯定有什么是我们能做的
<25-7,ALEXIS>There has to be something we can do.

687
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,210
<25-8,CASTLE>也许真的有
<25-8,CASTLE>Well, maybe there is.

688
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:06,220
<25-8,CASTLE>只有百分之十的人是左撇子
<25-8,CASTLE>Only 10% of the population is left-handed.

689
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:08,760
<25-8,CASTLE>我们肯定有法子能找出乘客当中
<25-8,CASTLE>There must be a way for us to figure out who of the passengers

690
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,230
<25-8,CASTLE>谁是左撇子  这样能缩小嫌疑人的范围
<25-8,CASTLE>is a southpaw, thus narrowing our suspect pool.

691
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:14,230
<25-9,FARRAH>我们可以把入境和海关申报表发下去
<25-9,FARRAH>We could pass out customs and immigration forms.

692
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:16,160
<25-9,FARRAH>这样我们就知道谁是左撇子了
<25-9,FARRAH>Then we'd know who's left-handed.

693
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,530
<25-10,CASTLE>聪明  现在你的思维方式就像个推理作家
<25-10,CASTLE>Brilliant. Now you're thinking like a mystery writer.

694
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,850
<26-1,ALEXIS>-你觉得这有用吗  -不知道
<26-1,ALEXIS>- Think this will work? - I don't know.

695
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:31,860
<26-2,CASTLE>总比什么都不做好
<26-2,CASTLE>It's better than doing nothing.

696
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,880
<26-3,CASTLE>没能像那样睡过去简直太遗憾了
<26-3,CASTLE>Too bad we didn't sleep through this, too, huh?

698
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:56,440
<26-3,CASTLE>只是确认一下它还在
<26-3,CASTLE>Just making sure it's still there.

699
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:01,080
<27-1,BECKETT>贝克特  我找到了
<27-1,BECKETT>Beckett, I got it.

700
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,570
<27-2,TORY>给空警发短信的手机
<27-2,TORY>The phone that texted the Marshal --

701
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:04,580
<27-2,TORY>手机是在网上购买并且是在机场
<27-2,TORY>The phone was purchased online and picked up at the airport

702
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:06,100
<27-2,TORY>一个空运商店提货的
<27-2,TORY>at a flight tech express store

703
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,930
<27-2,TORY>就在航班起飞前半小时不到
<27-2,TORY>Less than half an hour before the flight.

704
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,230
<27-3,ESPOSITO>那家商店有摄像头吗
<27-3,ESPOSITO>Does the store have any cameras?

705
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:10,610
<27-4,TORY>没有  机场的摄像头
<27-4,TORY>No, and the cameras in the airport

706
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:12,200
<27-4,TORY>都没有很好的角度能够拍到收银处
<27-4,TORY>don't have a good angle on the register.

707
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,360
<27-4,TORY>但我们不需要监控视频
<27-4,TORY>But we don't need video.

708
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,880
<27-4,TORY>买主用的是信用卡
<27-4,TORY>The purchaser used a credit card.

709
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,800
<27-4,TORY>我们找到了她的名字  我查了旅客名单
<27-4,TORY>We have her name, and I checked the manifest.

710
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,840
<27-4,TORY>她就在飞机上
<27-4,TORY>She's on the plane.

711
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:21,330
<28-1,CASTLE>马琳·辛格
<28-1,CASTLE>Marilyn Singer?

712
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:23,160
<28-2,BECKETT>她说是大洋航空的前执行总监
<28-2,BECKETT>Yeah, she's a former Oceanic executive

713
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:25,740
<28-2,BECKETT>去年被解雇  卡塞尔听这个
<28-2,BECKETT>who got fired last year, and, Castle, get this.

714
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:29,560
<28-2,BECKETT>她对航空公司提出非法解雇的诉讼
<28-2,BECKETT>She filed a wrongful termination suit accusing the airline

715
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:32,080
<28-2,BECKETT>指控公司排挤她
<28-2,BECKETT>of blackballing her, and last week the judge

716
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,100
<28-2,BECKETT>上周法官判她败诉
<28-2,BECKETT>ruled against her in favor of Oceanic Airlines.

717
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,190
<28-3,CASTLE>于是她想
<28-3,CASTLE>So she wants to --

718
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:38,380
<28-3,CASTLE>想让他们的飞机坠毁
<28-3,CASTLE>So she wants to take down

719
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:40,070
<28-3,CASTLE>来进行报复吗
<28-3,CASTLE>one of their planes for revenge?

720
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,280
<28-3,CASTLE>听上去有点极端
<28-3,CASTLE>That seems a little extreme.

721
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,790
<28-4,BECKETT>是的  卡塞尔  但这和她发给空警
<28-4,BECKETT>Yes, Castle, but it's consistent with the texts

722
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:45,190
<28-4,BECKETT>短信的内容一致
<28-4,BECKETT>she sent the air marshal.

723
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:46,900
<28-4,BECKETT>对她来说  毁掉坑了她的航空公司
<28-4,BECKETT>and what better way for her to destroy the airline

724
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:49,090
<28-4,BECKETT>还有什么更好的办法吗
<28-4,BECKETT>she believes ruined her life?

725
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:52,510
<28-5,CASTLE>她坐在什么位置
<28-5,CASTLE>What seat is she in?

726
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,440
<29-1,ALEXIS>那是马琳吗
<29-1,ALEXIS>That's Marilyn?

727
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,550
<29-2,CASTLE>假发  眼镜
<29-2,CASTLE>The hair, the glasses --

728
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:59,420
<29-2,CASTLE>她不想被人认出来
<29-2,CASTLE>She did not want to be recognized.

729
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:02,690
<29-3,ALEXIS>爸爸  左手  就是她
<29-3,ALEXIS>Dad, left hand. It's her.

730
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:05,520
<29-4,CASTLE>我们需要在她实施计划之前
<29-4,CASTLE>Okay, we need to isolate her before she carries out

731
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,130
<29-4,CASTLE>-把她隔离起来  -怎么做呢
<29-4,CASTLE>- whatever her plan is. - How?

732
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:09,900
<29-6,CASTLE>回到你的座位
<29-6,CASTLE>Go to your seat.

733
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:11,040
<29-7,ALEXIS>你要做什么
<29-7,ALEXIS>What are you gonna do?

734
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,340
<29-8,CASTLE>非常蠢的事
<29-8,CASTLE>Something very stupid.

735
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:14,230
<29-9,ALEXIS>她有枪
<29-9,ALEXIS>She has a gun.

736
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:16,550
<29-10,CASTLE>所以我让你离得远一点
<29-10,CASTLE>Which is why I want you as far away as possible.

737
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:18,070
<29-11,ALEXIS>可我也担心你啊
<29-11,ALEXIS>You know I feel the same way about you, right?

738
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,790
<29-12,CASTLE>我知道  听着
<29-12,CASTLE>I do, I do. Now...

739
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:22,470
<29-12,CASTLE>回到你的座位  求你了
<29-12,CASTLE>Go back to your seat. Please.

740
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:27,410
<29-12,CASTLE>我需要一杯酒
<29-12,CASTLE>I'm gonna need a glass of wine.

741
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,000
<29-12,CASTLE>红酒
<29-12,CASTLE>Red.

742
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,460
<30-1,CASTLE>天啊  太对不起了
<30-1,CASTLE>Oh, my -- I am so sorry.

<30-4,DEBBIE>女士  会留下污渍的
<30-4,DEBBIE>Ma'am, you don't want that to set.

<30-4,DEBBIE>跟我到后面  我们会处理好的
<30-4,DEBBIE>Come back with me, and we'll take care of it.

749

<30-5,MARILYN>别碰我  我没事
<30-5,MARILYN>Don't touch me. I'm fine.

750
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:00,750
<30-6,CASTLE>-你还是跟她走吧  -我说了我没事
<30-6,CASTLE>- Maybe you should go with her. - I said I'm fine.

751
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:03,460
<30-7,MARILYN>有枪
<30-7,MARILYN>Gun!

752
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,540
<30-8,CASTLE>我的天
<30-8,CASTLE>Oh, my god!

753
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:15,030
<30-9,FARRAH>女士们先生们  请坐好
<30-9,FARRAH>Uh...ladies and gentlemen, please remain seated.

754
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:18,840
<30-9,FARRAH>我们显然遇到了些情况  但一切都在掌控中
<30-9,FARRAH>We obviously had a situation, but we have it under control.

755
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,020
<31-1,MARILYN>我告诉你  这是个误会
<31-1,MARILYN>I'm telling you, this is some kind of mistake.

756
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,660
<31-1,MARILYN>那枪不是我的
<31-1,MARILYN>That gun is not mine.

757
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:24,320
<31-2,CASTLE>马琳你有什么计划
<31-2,CASTLE>What was your plan, Marilyn?

758
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,290
<31-2,CASTLE>挟持人质  让飞机坠毁吗
<31-2,CASTLE>Take hostages, try to bring down the plane?

759
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:28,350
<31-3,MARILYN>让飞机坠机
<31-3,MARILYN>Bring down the plane?

760
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:30,140
<31-3,MARILYN>你在乱说些什么
<31-3,MARILYN>What the hell are you talking about?

761
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:32,480
<31-4,CASTLE>我说的是你指控大洋航空败诉
<31-4,CASTLE>I'm talking about the suit you lost against Oceanic,

762
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,320
<31-4,CASTLE>以及你发到这个手机上的威胁短信
<31-4,CASTLE>and the threatening texts you sent from this phone.

763
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,640
<31-5,MARILYN>那不是我的手机
<31-5,MARILYN>That is not my phone.

764
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,330
<31-6,CASTLE>在你包里  用你的信用卡买的
<31-6,CASTLE>It was in your purse, paid for with your credit card.

765
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,050
<31-7,MARILYN>凯尔在哪  我要和他谈
<31-7,MARILYN>Where's Kyle? I want to talk to Kyle.

766
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:45,170
<31-7,MARILYN>我知道他是这架航班的空警
<31-7,MARILYN>I know he's the air marshal on this flight.

767
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:48,650
<31-7,MARILYN>是他让你这么做的吗  这一点都不好笑
<31-7,MARILYN>Did he put you up to this? Because it is not funny.

768
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:51,470
<31-8,CASTLE>你怎么会认识福特先生
<31-8,CASTLE>How is it that you know Mr. Ford?

769
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,130
<31-9,MARILYN>他是我男朋友  行了吧
<31-9,MARILYN>He's my boyfriend, all right?

770
00:31:57,990 --> 00:31:59,590
<31-9,MARILYN>如果他觉得这是在教训我
<31-9,MARILYN>And if he thinks he's teaching me a lesson,

771
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:01,900
<31-9,MARILYN>我要真的发火了
<31-9,MARILYN>I'm going to be seriously pissed.

772
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,460
<31-9,MARILYN>他现在在哪
<31-9,MARILYN>Now where is he?

773
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:04,960
<31-9,MARILYN>马琳
<31-9,MARILYN>Marilyn...

774
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:07,200
<31-10,CASTLE>凯尔死了
<31-10,CASTLE>Kyle is dead.

775
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:12,750
<31-11,MARILYN>死了
<31-11,MARILYN>Dead?

776
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:17,480
<31-11,MARILYN>凯尔死了  怎么会这样
<31-11,MARILYN>Kyle's dead? How?

777
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,520
<31-12,CASTLE>这你应该清楚
<31-12,CASTLE>You should know.

778
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:20,360
<31-12,CASTLE>他的枪就在你包里
<31-12,CASTLE>His gun was in your purse.

779
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,470
<31-12,CASTLE>不是  我
<31-12,CASTLE>No. I --

780
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:25,050
<31-13,MARILYN>我根本不知道发生了什么事
<31-13,MARILYN>I-I don't understand what's going on.

781
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:27,880
<31-13,MARILYN>一定是有人在我去洗手间的时候
<31-13,MARILYN>Someone else must have put that in my bag with the phone

782
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,340
<31-13,MARILYN>把枪和手机放进我的包里
<31-13,MARILYN>when I was in the bathroom.

783
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:33,870
<31-14,CASTLE>你出门旅行总是戴假发吗
<31-14,CASTLE>And I suppose you always wear a wig when you travel?

784
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:35,330
<31-14,CASTLE>你不懂  我以为
<31-14,CASTLE>You don't understand. I thought --

785
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:38,570
<31-15,MARILYN>我以为凯尔有外遇了
<31-15,MARILYN>I thought kyle was having an affair.

786
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,250
<31-15,MARILYN>这本是我们拍拖半周年纪念日
<31-15,MARILYN>It was our 6-month anniversary,

787
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:43,520
<31-15,MARILYN>我们本来要一起过周末的
<31-15,MARILYN>and we were supposed to go away for the weekend.

788
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:46,800
<31-15,MARILYN>但最后一刻  凯尔打电话给我
<31-15,MARILYN>But at the last minute, Kyle called

789
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,440
<31-15,MARILYN>说他得在这班飞机上工作
<31-15,MARILYN>and said he had to work this flight,

790
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,920
<31-15,MARILYN>他要顶替某人的班
<31-15,MARILYN>that he had to fill in for someone.

791
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,520
<31-15,MARILYN>但我听出了言外之意
<31-15,MARILYN>But there was something in his voice,

792
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:56,030
<31-15,MARILYN>好像他没有告诉我实情
<31-15,MARILYN>like he wasn't telling me the whole story.

793
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:59,490
<31-16,CASTLE>所以你决定跟踪他  跟他上同一班飞机
<31-16,CASTLE>So you decided to stalk him, follow him onto this plane?

794
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:00,980
<31-17,MARILYN>我们在空中邂逅
<31-17,MARILYN>We met in the air.

795
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,330
<31-17,MARILYN>在长途跋涉中坠入爱河
<31-17,MARILYN>Fell in love on the long haul.

796
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:06,800
<31-17,MARILYN>我想也许他爱上了其他人
<31-17,MARILYN>I thought maybe he'd found someone else.

797
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:09,630
<31-18,CASTLE>所以你就引他来到这  和他对质
<31-18,CASTLE>Is that why you lured him back here? To confront him?

798
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:11,850
<31-18,CASTLE>事情愈演愈烈  你一气之下杀了他
<31-18,CASTLE>And when it all went south, you killed him in a rage?

799
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:12,630
<31-18,CASTLE>不是
<31-18,CASTLE>No.

800
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:15,700
<31-19,MARILYN>我不会这么做的  拜托
<31-19,MARILYN>I wouldn't do that. Please.

801
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:17,440
<31-19,MARILYN>你们一定要相信我
<31-19,MARILYN>You have to believe me.

802
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:19,710
<31-20,CASTLE>我没法相信
<31-20,CASTLE>I can't afford to.

803
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:23,130
<31-20,CASTLE>吉姆  把她带到下面去  确保她别乱跑
<31-20,CASTLE>Jim, take her down below. Make sure she's secure.

804
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:36,200
<31-21,ALEXIS>怎么了
<31-21,ALEXIS>What's wrong?

805
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:37,590
<31-22,CASTLE>我不知道  就是
<31-22,CASTLE>I don't know. Just --

806
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:40,180
<31-22,CASTLE>当我告诉她福特死了的时候
<31-22,CASTLE>When I told her Ford was dead,

807
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:42,790
<31-22,CASTLE>她的反应看起来如此真实
<31-22,CASTLE>her reaction seemed so real.

808
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:45,210
<31-23,ALEXIS>爸爸  枪和手机都在她的包里
<31-23,ALEXIS>Dad, the gun and phone were in her purse.

809
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:46,410
<31-23,ALEXIS>她又是左撇子  我
<31-23,ALEXIS>She's left-handed. I --

810
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:47,900
<31-23,ALEXIS>不  我知道  所有的证据都指向她
<31-23,ALEXIS>No, I know, I know. Everything fits.

811
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,230
<31-24,CASTLE>但为什么网购
<31-24,CASTLE>But why buy a pre-paid phone online

812
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:53,020
<31-24,CASTLE>然后很快就去机场店里取
<31-24,CASTLE>just to pick it up at the airport store minutes later?

813
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:55,040
<31-24,CASTLE>何不直接去店里买
<31-24,CASTLE>Why not just walk into the store and buy it?

814
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:56,390
<31-24,CASTLE>还有为什么要用会被追踪到的
<31-24,CASTLE>And why use a credit card that could be traced

815
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:57,740
<31-24,CASTLE>信用卡  除非
<31-24,CASTLE>back to her, unless...

816
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:00,710
<34-3,ALEXIS>除非这都是计划好的
<34-3,ALEXIS>Unless that was part of the plan?

817
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,990
<31-24,CASTLE>证据都指向完美的嫌疑人
<31-24,CASTLE>To give us the perfect suspect

818
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:05,940
<31-24,CASTLE>这样我们就不会追查真相了
<31-24,CASTLE>so we'd stop looking for the truth.

819
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:08,570
<31-25,ALEXIS>你觉得有人陷害她
<31-25,ALEXIS>You think someone set her up?

820
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:12,880
<31-26,CASTLE>我觉得这件事没这么简单
<31-26,CASTLE>I think something else is going on here.

821
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,690
<32-1,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你在飞机上经历了很多
<32-1,BECKETT>Look, Castle, you've been through a lot up there,

822
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:22,290
<32-1,BECKETT>也许是你作家想象力太丰富
<32-1,BECKETT>so maybe your storyteller's imagination's

823
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:24,310
<32-1,BECKETT>-又开始乱推理了  -我跟你说
<32-1,BECKETT>- getting the best of you. - I'm telling you,

824
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:26,460
<32-2,CASTLE>这件事没那么简单
<32-2,CASTLE>there's a lot more going on here.

825
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:29,470
<32-2,CASTLE>有人想要我们就此结案  但并没有
<32-2,CASTLE>Someone wants us to think this is over, but it's not.

826
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:30,560
<32-3,RYAN>卡塞尔也许是对的
<32-3,RYAN>Castle may be right.

827
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,440
<32-4,ESPOSITO>我们联系了空警局
<32-4,ESPOSITO>We contacted the Air Marshal Service.

828
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,350
<32-4,ESPOSITO>福特没有帮人顶替
<32-4,ESPOSITO>Ford wasn't filling in for anyone.

829
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:35,920
<32-4,ESPOSITO>是他要求上这班飞机的
<32-4,ESPOSITO>He requested to be on that flight.

830
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:38,530
<32-5,RYAN>我们复查了福特的财务记录
<32-5,RYAN>We also double-checked Ford's financial records,

831
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:41,330
<32-5,RYAN>发现刚刚有一笔交易
<32-5,RYAN>and we found a transaction that just posted.

832
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:45,430
<32-5,RYAN>是一笔9950美元电汇到他的银行账户
<32-5,RYAN>It turns out $9,950 was wired to his bank account

833
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:47,020
<32-5,RYAN>就在飞机起飞前几分钟
<32-5,RYAN>just minutes before takeoff.

834
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:48,870
<32-6,BECKETT>刚好在一万美元以下
<32-6,BECKETT>Just under the $10,000 mark.

835
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:50,540
<32-6,BECKETT>有人不想让联调局知道
<32-6,BECKETT>Someone didn't want to tip off the Feds.

836
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:52,960
<32-7,ESPOSITO>不管发生了什么事  福特都牵涉其中
<32-7,ESPOSITO>Whatever's going on up there, Ford is involved.

837
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:54,130
<32-8,CASTLE>这钱是从哪来的
<32-8,CASTLE>Who's the money from?

838
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:57,550
<32-9,RYAN>这个人  维克托·科斯托夫·迪特里希
<32-9,RYAN>This guy -- Victor Kristoph Dietrich.

839
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:59,630
<32-9,RYAN>他是个富有的德国实业家
<32-9,RYAN>He's a wealthy German industrialist,

840
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:01,770
<32-9,RYAN>在进出口贸易圈名气很大
<32-9,RYAN>big name in the import/export business.

841
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:03,720
<32-9,RYAN>美国海关人员指出他涉嫌
<32-9,RYAN>U.S. Customs officials have flagged him

842
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:06,410
<32-9,RYAN>多次违规  但从未被逮到
<32-9,RYAN>several times for violations, but nothing ever stuck.

843
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,690
<32-10,ALEXIS>你觉得福特要求上这个航班
<32-10,ALEXIS>Do you think Ford requested to be on this flight

844
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:10,430
<32-10,ALEXIS>是因为迪特里希花钱雇他
<32-10,ALEXIS>because Dietrich paid him to be on it?

845
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:11,830
<32-11,CASTLE>是的  但原因呢
<32-11,CASTLE>Yes, but why?

846
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,060
<32-12,BECKETT>迪特里希现在在哪
<32-12,BECKETT>Where is Dietrich?

847
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:14,670
<32-13,ESPOSITO>他的办公室离这两个街区
<32-13,ESPOSITO>His office is two blocks away.

848
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:16,580
<32-14,BECKETT>-马上叫来问话  -好的
<32-14,BECKETT>-I want him here. - Now. Yeah.

849
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:21,970
<33-1,VICTOR DIETRICH>我很抱歉  警探  但我从没见过这个人
<33-1,VICTOR DIETRICH>I am sorry, Detectives, but I've never seen him before.

850
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:24,420
<33-2,BECKETT>那为何你的账户转了一万美元
<33-2,BECKETT>Then why was $10,000 transferred from your bank account

851
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:26,020
<33-2,BECKETT>到他的账户  迪特里希先生
<33-2,BECKETT>to his, Mr. Dietrich?

852
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:28,570
<33-3,DIETRICH>-一定是银行失误吧  -不  不是
<33-3,DIETRICH>- Must be some kind of banking error. - No, it's not.

853
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:30,950
<33-4,BECKETT>两边的银行都确认过了
<33-4,BECKETT>Both of your financial institutions confirmed it.

854
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,500
<33-5,DIETRICH>乐善好施又不算犯罪
<33-5,DIETRICH>It isn't a crime to give a gift.

855
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,790
<33-6,BECKETT>怎么  这是礼物吗
<33-6,BECKETT>Oh, so it's a gift now?

856
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,650
<33-6,BECKETT>给一个你素昧平生的人
<33-6,BECKETT>To someone that you don't even know?

857
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:38,470
<33-7,RYAN>你为何要付钱
<33-7,RYAN>What were you paying

858
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,570
<33-7,RYAN>给福特空警  迪特里希先生
<33-7,RYAN>the Air Marshal for, Mr. Dietrich?

859
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:43,830
<33-8,DIETRICH>很高兴和你们谈话  但我得走了
<33-8,DIETRICH>This has been delightful, but I'm afraid I have to go.

860
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:46,430
<33-9,RYAN>不行  你哪都不能去
<33-9,RYAN>Um, no. You're -- you're not going anywhere.

861
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:48,480
<33-10,DIETRICH>你没有理由扣押我
<33-10,DIETRICH>You have no cause to hold me.

862
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:49,420
<33-11,BECKETT>事实上  我们有
<33-11,BECKETT>Actually, we do.

863
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,100
<33-11,BECKETT>作为重要证人
<33-11,BECKETT>As a material witness.

<33-15,BECKETT>是的  这些钱是用来做什么的
<33-15,BECKETT>Yes. Now what was the money for?

<33-22,DIETRICH>他只是负责看着手表
<33-22,DIETRICH>He was merely keeping an eye on it.

<33-23,RYAN>你让一个学徒戴着1300万的手表
<33-23,RYAN>You gave an apprentice a $13 million watch?

00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:45,900
<33-24,BECKETT>或者交税了
<33-24,BECKETT>or pay taxes on it.

00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,400
<34-6,AARON>感谢上帝
<34-6,AARON>Thank god.

903
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:21,810
<34-7,AARON>放开我
<34-7,AARON>Let go of me!

904
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:23,480
<34-7,AARON>先别感谢上帝
<34-7,AARON>Don't thank god just yet.

905
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:24,920
<34-8,CASTLE>这表是假的
<34-8,CASTLE>This watch is a fake.

906
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,810
<34-8,CASTLE>真的天神表是自动上发条的
<34-8,CASTLE>The real celestialis is self-winding.

907
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:28,350
<34-8,CASTLE>这表有旋钮
<34-8,CASTLE>This watch has a knob.

908
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,880
<34-8,CASTLE>也就是说这一切跟恐怖主义无关
<34-8,CASTLE>Which means this was never about terrorism,

909
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,030
<34-8,CASTLE>这是劫案
<34-8,CASTLE>it was about a heist.

910
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:34,440
<34-9,AARON>我不明白
<34-9,AARON>I don't -- I don't understand.

911
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,040
<34-10,CASTLE>你戴的是假冒的
<34-10,CASTLE>You're wearing a knockoff.

912
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,000
<34-10,CASTLE>睡着时被调包了
<34-10,CASTLE>It got switched out while you were sleeping.

913
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,390
<34-10,CASTLE>你在下飞机之后
<34-10,CASTLE>You weren't supposed to realize it

914
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,570
<34-10,CASTLE>才会发觉
<34-10,CASTLE>until you were off the plane

915
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:42,380
<34-10,CASTLE>到时真表早就不见踪影了
<34-10,CASTLE>and the real watch was long gone.

916
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:44,840
<34-11,ALEXIS>那个讨厌的家伙坐位被调换了
<34-11,ALEXIS>That obnoxious guy who had his seat changed.

917
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,700
<34-11,ALEXIS>他原本应该坐在这里吗
<34-11,ALEXIS>Was this originally where he was supposed to sit?

918
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:49,110
<34-12,FARRAH>是的  但福特先生两天前要求坐这里
<34-12,FARRAH>Yes, but Mr. Ford put in a request for that seat

919
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:51,290
<34-12,FARRAH>空警是有优先权的
<34-12,FARRAH>two days ago, and air marshals get priority,

920
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:52,860
<34-12,FARRAH>于是就把坐位留给了他
<34-12,FARRAH>so the system assigned it to him.

921
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:54,710
<34-13,CASTLE>他知道坐这里是看管手表
<34-13,CASTLE>He knew it was the perfect vantage point

922
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:55,960
<34-13,CASTLE>的最佳位置
<34-13,CASTLE>from which to watch the watch.

923
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,310
<34-14,ALEXIS>但小偷一定是发现了
<34-14,ALEXIS>But the thief must have found out.

924
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:59,060
<34-14,ALEXIS>有空警坐在这  小偷没法动手
<34-14,ALEXIS>And they couldn't steal the watch with an air marshal

925
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:02,480
<34-14,ALEXIS>于是就把他从头等舱引走
<34-14,ALEXIS>sitting right there, so they had to lure ford out of first class.

926
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:04,640
<34-15,CASTLE>用一部能追查到
<34-15,CASTLE>Using a phone that, if traced,

927
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,500
<34-15,CASTLE>福特女友的手机
<34-15,CASTLE>would lead them back to Ford's girlfriend,

928
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,670
<34-15,CASTLE>她刚好有作案动机
<34-15,CASTLE>who had a motive.

929
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,240
<34-16,ALEXIS>老爸  这意味着小偷知道谁在飞机上
<34-16,ALEXIS>Dad, that means the thief knows who's on the plane.

930
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,470
<34-16,ALEXIS>能拿到旅客名单  位置表
<34-16,ALEXIS>They had access to the manifest, seat assignments,

931
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:14,850
<34-16,ALEXIS>还了解福特的私人生活
<34-16,ALEXIS>Ford's personal life.

932
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,820
<34-17,CASTLE>还有旅客的信用卡
<34-17,CASTLE>And passenger credit cards.

933
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,280
<34-17,CASTLE>这是内部人干的
<34-17,CASTLE>This was an inside job.

934
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:21,790
<34-17,CASTLE>艾伦  饮品是谁给你的
<34-17,CASTLE>Aaron, who served you this drink?

935
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:23,160
<34-17,CASTLE>有人下了药
<34-17,CASTLE>Because someone spiked it.

936
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,970
<34-18,AARON>不记得
<34-18,AARON>I can't remember.

937
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:26,870
<34-18,AARON>但通常是她
<34-18,AARON>But it's usually her.

938
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,750
<34-19,FARRAH>不是我  我没给人下药
<34-19,FARRAH>No. No. I did not drug anybody.

939
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,170
<34-20,ALEXIS>爸  她做不到
<34-20,ALEXIS>Dad, she couldn't have.

940
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:33,140
<34-20,ALEXIS>她当时在第二过道给我们服务
<34-20,ALEXIS>She was serving us over in aisle 2.

941
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:35,500
<34-21,CASTLE>那就是...
<34-21,CASTLE>Well, then it was...

942
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:39,080
<34-22,DEBBIE>退后
<34-22,DEBBIE>Stay back.

943
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:42,200
<34-23,FARRAH>黛比
<34-23,FARRAH>Debbie?

944
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:45,240
<34-24,DEBBIE>是你
<34-24,DEBBIE>You?

945

<34-26,DEBBIE>30 years

948
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:56,220
<34-26,DEBBIE>忠诚服务
<34-26,DEBBIE>of loyal service.

949
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,660
<34-26,DEBBIE>我终于要退休了
<34-26,DEBBIE>I was finally ready to retire.

950
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:00,830
<34-26,DEBBIE>大洋航空做了什么
<34-26,DEBBIE>So what does Oceanic do?

951
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:02,840
<34-26,DEBBIE>他们调整
<34-26,DEBBIE>They restructure...

952
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:05,820
<34-26,DEBBIE>废除了我们的养老保险
<34-26,DEBBIE>and eliminate our peions.

953
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:06,930
<34-27,CASTLE>黛比
<34-27,CASTLE>Debbie...

954
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,970
<34-28,CASTLE>这不是你想做的事  放下枪
<34-28,CASTLE>You don't want to do this. Drop this gun.

955
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:12,740
<34-29,DEBBIE>你知道每个月在头等舱
<34-29,DEBBIE>Do you have any idea what it's like

956
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:16,640
<34-29,DEBBIE>给这个混小子服务什么感受吗
<34-29,DEBBIE>serving this little punk kid in first class every month?

957
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:19,610
<34-29,DEBBIE>听他吹嘘手腕上的东西
<34-29,DEBBIE>Hearing him brag about how much money

958
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:21,060
<34-29,DEBBIE>价值连城
<34-29,DEBBIE>he's got strapped to his wrist.

959
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:23,450
<34-29,DEBBIE>而我一无所有
<34-29,DEBBIE>When I have nothing.

960
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:28,970
<34-30,ALEXIS>于是当你得知他又要坐这架航班
<34-30,ALEXIS>So when you found out he was taking this flight again,

961
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:31,060
<34-30,ALEXIS>决定有所行动
<34-30,ALEXIS>you decided to do something.

962
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,850
<34-31,DEBBIE>我听说了那块表
<34-31,DEBBIE>I heard about that watch.

963
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:35,150
<34-31,DEBBIE>要被拍卖
<34-31,DEBBIE>How it was gonna be auctioned off.

964
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:36,660
<34-31,DEBBIE>1300万美金
<34-31,DEBBIE>That's $13 million!

965
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,350
<34-31,DEBBIE>但没人
<34-31,DEBBIE>But nobody...

966
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:42,160
<34-31,DEBBIE>没人会受到伤害的
<34-31,DEBBIE>Nobody was supposed to get hurt.

967
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:46,230
<34-31,DEBBIE>我只需福特离开他
<34-31,DEBBIE>All right, I j-- I just needed Ford to step away

968
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:47,730
<34-31,DEBBIE>一小会儿
<34-31,DEBBIE>from him for like a minute.

969
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,950
<34-31,DEBBIE>但当他看到艾伦睡着了
<34-31,DEBBIE>But when he saw Aaron was sleeping...

970
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:53,510
<34-30,ALEXIS>他就明白了
<34-30,ALEXIS>He knew.

971
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:57,900
<34-28,CASTLE>他在货舱找到我
<34-28,CASTLE>He tracked me down to the cargo hold.

00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:58,810
<34-27,CASTLE>黛比
<34-27,CASTLE>Debbie...

974
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,060

<34-32,ALEXIS>But please don't make it worse.
