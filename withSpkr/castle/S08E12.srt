<1-15,CASTLE>有没有空见个面  商谈...戏剧化停顿
<1-15,CASTLE>for a meeting to talk about a... dramatic pause...

00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:48,440
<1-21,CASTLE>就是个无良的玩笑
<1-21,CASTLE>It was a silly joke.

43
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,830
<1-22,ALEXIS>更像是半公开的威胁
<1-22,ALEXIS>More like a thinly veiled threat.

<1-22,ALEXIS>有什么区别
<1-22,ALEXIS>Tomato, to-mah-to.

00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:12,860
<6-6,ESPOSITO>怎么说
<6-6,ESPOSITO>Strange how?

129
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,320
<6-7,JENNIFER>艾玛刚获得升职
<6-7,JENNIFER>Well, Emma had just gotten a promotion

130
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,540
<6-7,JENNIFER>去制作11点档新闻
<6-7,JENNIFER>to produce the 11:00 news.

131
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,430
<6-8,LILA>这对她来说很重大
<6-8,LILA>Which was a huge deal for her.

132
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,060
<6-8,LILA>是啊
<6-8,LILA>Exactly.

133
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,210
<6-9,JENNIFER>但她这一周都...
<6-9,JENNIFER>Yet all this week, she was acting kind of...

134
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:20,910
<6-9,JENNIFER>怎么说呢
<6-9,JENNIFER>I don't know.

135
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,380
<6-10,LILA>-怪怪的  -是啊
<6-10,LILA>- Off. - Yeah.

136
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,880
<6-12,ESPOSITO>知道为什么吗
<6-12,ESPOSITO>Well, any idea why?

137
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:25,780
<6-13,JENNIFER>艾玛跟我说
<6-13,JENNIFER>Well, Emma confided in me

138
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,290
<6-13,JENNIFER>她拿到了什么
<6-13,JENNIFER>that she had gotten her hands on

139
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:28,790
<6-13,JENNIFER>证明
<6-13,JENNIFER>some kind of proof.

140
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:30,720
<6-14,RYAN>什么的证明
<6-14,RYAN>Uh, proof of what?

141
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,000
<6-15,JENNIFER>她说不能告诉我
<6-15,JENNIFER>She said that she couldn't tell me,

142
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,660
<6-15,JENNIFER>至少得等到时机合适
<6-15,JENNIFER>at least not until after the time was right,

143
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:35,640
<6-15,JENNIFER>不知是什么意思
<6-15,JENNIFER>whatever that meant.

144
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,640
<6-16,ESPOSITO>你们是否知道
<6-16,ESPOSITO>Do either of you know

145
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,850
<6-16,ESPOSITO>艾玛跟谁有什么私人恩怨吗
<6-16,ESPOSITO>if Emma was having personal problems with anyone,

146
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:41,030
<6-16,ESPOSITO>比如工作上或者生活上
<6-16,ESPOSITO>anyone at work, in her personal life?

147
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:41,980
<6-17,JENNIFER>我是不知道
<6-17,JENNIFER>Not that I know of.

148
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,350
<6-18,LILA>有巴克利
<6-18,LILA>Well, there's Buckley.

149
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:44,770
<6-19,JENNIFER>是啊  但新闻编辑室的人
<6-19,JENNIFER>Yeah, but everybody in the newsroom

150
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:45,750
<6-19,JENNIFER>都对巴克利有问题
<6-19,JENNIFER>has problems with Buckley.

151
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:46,580
<6-20,ESPOSITO>那是谁
<6-20,ESPOSITO>Who's Buckley?

152
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,930
<6-21,JENNIFER>是电视台另一位制作人
<6-21,JENNIFER>Another producer at the station...

153
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,700
<6-21,JENNIFER>他比艾玛资历深
<6-21,JENNIFER>he had seniority over Emma,

154
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,330
<6-21,JENNIFER>但她却代替他升了职
<6-21,JENNIFER>but she beat him out for that promotion.

155
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:52,350
<6-22,LILA>巴克利很不爽
<6-22,LILA>And Buckley was pissed.

156
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,310
<6-23,JENNIFER>是啊  他甚至说
<6-23,JENNIFER>Yeah, I mean, he even claimed

157
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,600
<6-23,JENNIFER>她为了得到工作散布了他的谣言
<6-23,JENNIFER>that she'd made up lies about him just to get the job.

158
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,090
<6-24,LILA>但我无法想象他会为此杀人
<6-24,LILA>But I can't imagine he would kill her for that.

159
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:01,720
<6-25,RYAN>巴克利是否开一辆白色货车
<6-25,RYAN>By any chance, does Buckley drive a white van?

160
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,800
<6-26,LILA>是的
<6-26,LILA>Yeah, he does.

161
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,350
<7-1,CASTLE>我又回幼儿园了吗
<7-1,CASTLE>What, am I in kindergarten again?

162
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:44,060
<7-2,CASTLE>芬奇老师呢
<7-2,CASTLE>So where's Mrs. Finch?

163
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:49,730
<7-2,CASTLE>你不是芬奇老师
<7-2,CASTLE>You are not Mrs. Finch.

164
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,310
<7-3,JUDAH>你们是谁
<7-3,JUDAH>Who are you guys?

165
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:58,360
<7-4,CASTLE>我在哪
<7-4,CASTLE>Where am I?

166
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,310
<7-4,CASTLE>我不知道
<7-4,CASTLE>I don't know.

167
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,310
<7-5,SIMON>我和这人刚醒来
<7-5,SIMON>Me and this guy just woke up.

168
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,920
<7-6,TODD>我的肩膀好疼
<7-6,TODD>My shoulder's killing me.

169
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:11,260
<7-7,JUDAH>有人有电话吗  我的不见了
<7-7,JUDAH>Anyone have a phone? Mine's gone.

170
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:13,150
<7-8,CASTLE>没有
<7-8,CASTLE>No.

171
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:14,230
<7-9,SIMON>怎么回事
<7-9,SIMON>What the hell is going on?

172
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:15,210
<7-9,SIMON>我们怎么过来的
<7-9,SIMON>How did we get here?

173
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:17,640
<7-10,CASTLE>我印象里最后一件事是去
<7-10,CASTLE>Last thing I remember I-I went to a...

174
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:20,390
<7-10,CASTLE>一栋破破烂烂的大楼见史蒂芬·金
<7-10,CASTLE>a run-down building going to meet Stephen King

175
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,090
<7-10,CASTLE>然后灯一盏盏熄灭了
<7-10,CASTLE>and then all the lights went out.

176
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:24,690
<7-11,JUDAH>等等  尼可拉斯街143号吗
<7-11,JUDAH>Hold on... 143 Nicholas Street?

177
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,950
<7-12,CASTLE>你怎么知道
<7-12,CASTLE>How did you know that?

178
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,670
<7-13,JUDAH>有个律师来电话  叫我去见他
<7-13,JUDAH>A lawyer called, asked me to meet him there...

179
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,150
<7-13,JUDAH>说我从一年前
<7-13,JUDAH>said I inherited the building

180
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,690
<7-13,JUDAH>去世的叔叔那里继承了这栋楼
<7-13,JUDAH>from my uncle who passed away a year ago.

181
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:33,040
<7-14,SIMON>是啊  我也是收到了这样的消息
<7-14,SIMON>Yeah, I was told the same thing,

182
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,600
<7-14,SIMON>但说的是我几个月前
<7-14,SIMON>except it was supposedly my cousin

183
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,080
<7-14,SIMON>去世的堂亲
<7-14,SIMON>who died a few months ago.

184
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,590
<7-14,SIMON>天呐
<7-14,SIMON>Oh, my God.

185
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:39,940
<7-15,TODD>我们都被骗了过去
<7-15,TODD>We were all lured there.

186
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,740
<7-16,CASTLE>可是谁呢
<7-16,CASTLE>Yeah, but by whom?

187
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:48,270
<7-17,TODD>我胳膊上有黏黏的东西
<7-17,TODD>There's a sticky substance on my arms.

188
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,580
<7-17,TODD>你们呢
<7-17,TODD>Do you guys have that?

189
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,630
<7-18,JUDAH>这东西撞不开
<7-18,JUDAH>This thing's not budging.

190
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,530
<7-19,CASTLE>好吧
<7-19,CASTLE>Okay, um...

191
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:05,150
<7-19,CASTLE>我在走廊里
<7-19,CASTLE>You know, when I was in that hallway,

192
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:07,030
<7-19,CASTLE>看着灯熄灭的时候
<7-19,CASTLE>when the lights went out,

193
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:10,260
<7-19,CASTLE>最后只记得肩膀一阵刺痛
<7-19,CASTLE>last thing I remember was a sharp pain in my shoulder.

194
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:14,190
<7-19,CASTLE>我们肯定是被人用注射器或麻醉针下药了
<7-19,CASTLE>So we must have been drugged with a syringe or a tranq dart.

195
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:16,740
<7-20,SIMON>为什么啊  谁会这么对我们
<7-20,SIMON>But why? Who would do that to us?

196
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,620
<7-21,CASTLE>我猜是那个镜头后的人
<7-21,CASTLE>My guess is whoever's behind that camera.

197
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,780
<7-22,SIMON>天呐  是连环杀手
<7-22,SIMON>Oh, man, it's a serial killer.

198
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:30,040
<7-22,SIMON>我《日界线》上见过这种事的报道
<7-22,SIMON>I've seen stuff like this on "Dateline,"

199
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,590
<7-22,SIMON>从来没有好结局
<7-22,SIMON>and it never ends well.

200
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:32,410
<7-23,JUDAH>你能不能闭嘴
<7-23,JUDAH>Will you please shut the hell up?

201
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:33,360
<7-24,SIMON>我只是想告诉你
<7-24,SIMON>I'm just trying to tell you, this is a...

202
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,990
<7-25,JUDAH>-闭嘴  -各位
<7-25,JUDAH>- Shut up! - Guys...

203
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,460
<7-26,CASTLE>不管是谁做的
<7-26,CASTLE>whoever is behind this,

204
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:40,210
<7-26,CASTLE>如果那人想要我们死  我们早死了
<7-26,CASTLE>if they wanted us dead, we would be dead.

205
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:42,720
<7-26,CASTLE>所以显然对方是另有所图
<7-26,CASTLE>So, obviously, they want something else, right?

206
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,490
<7-27,SIMON>是啊  但什么呢
<7-27,SIMON>Yeah, b-but what?

207
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:46,050
<7-27,SIMON>我不知道
<7-27,SIMON>I don't know.

208
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,480
<7-28,CASTLE>我们到处看看吧
<7-28,CASTLE>Let's take a look around.

209
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,260
<7-28,CASTLE>显然有人费心费力地
<7-28,CASTLE>Obviously someone went through a lot of trouble

210
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:51,100
<7-28,CASTLE>设计了这里
<7-28,CASTLE>designing this place.

212
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:03,800
<7-28,CASTLE>伙计们
<7-28,CASTLE>Guys.

213
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,000
<7-29,CASTLE>"拯救就在其中"
<7-29,CASTLE>"Salvation lies within."

214
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,060
<7-30,SIMON>那是什么
<7-30,SIMON>What is that thing?

215
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,140
<7-31,CASTLE>是密码筒
<7-31,CASTLE>It's a cryptex.

216
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,100
<7-31,CASTLE>是个上锁的盒子
<7-31,CASTLE>It's kind of a lock box

217
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,800
<7-31,CASTLE>需要密码才能开启
<7-31,CASTLE>that requires a password to open it.

218
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,590
<7-31,CASTLE>我们需要密码
<7-31,CASTLE>So we just need the password.

219
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:17,400
<7-32,JUDAH>我们得马上冲出去
<7-32,JUDAH>We need to bust out of here... now.

220
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:26,130
<7-33,JUDAH>刃是橡皮的
<7-33,JUDAH>The blade's rubber.

221
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:29,430
<7-34,CASTLE>那是蜜蜂吗
<7-34,CASTLE>Is that a bee?

222
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:32,280
<7-35,TODD>我过敏  我严重过敏
<7-35,TODD>I'm allergic. I'm very allergic!

223
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,830
<7-36,CASTLE>放松  你把它激怒了
<7-36,CASTLE>Okay, well, relax. You're antagonizing it.

224
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:35,920
<7-37,TODD>它好像被我胳膊上的东西吸引
<7-37,TODD>I think it's attracted to the stuff that's on my arm.

225
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:39,500
<7-38,TODD>不
<7-38,TODD>Oh, no.

226
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:43,340
<7-38,TODD>你没事吧
<7-38,TODD>Are you all right?

227
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,200
<7-39,CASTLE>好了  放松  放松
<7-39,CASTLE>Okay, relax. Relax.

228
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,290
<7-39,CASTLE>你要过敏性休克了
<7-39,CASTLE>You're going into anaphylactic shock.

229
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:46,570
<7-39,CASTLE>你有肾上腺素吗
<7-39,CASTLE>Do you have epinephrine?

230
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,080
<7-40,TODD>我的注射器没了  本来就在我兜里的
<7-40,TODD>My injector's gone! It was in my pocket!

231
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,510
<7-40,TODD>哪去了  哪去了
<7-40,TODD>Where is it? Where is it?!

232
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:52,920
<7-41,JUDAH>没事的  哥们
<7-41,JUDAH>It's okay, man. It's okay.

<7-41,JUDAH>We'll find it.

234
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:55,710
<7-42,CASTLE>伙计们  这上面有蜜蜂的图案
<7-42,CASTLE>Guys, there's a picture of a bee.

235
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,590
<7-42,CASTLE>或许你的肾上腺素在这里面
<7-42,CASTLE>Maybe your epinephrine's in here.

236
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,920
<7-43,SIMON>我们怎么办
<7-43,SIMON>W-What should we do?

237
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,070
<7-44,CASTLE>我们需要密码
<7-44,CASTLE>We need the password.

238
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:06,530
<7-45,JUDAH>呼吸  呼吸
<7-45,JUDAH>Just breathe. Just breathe.

239
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:08,070
<7-45,JUDAH>好吗  我们会想到办法的
<7-45,JUDAH>All right? We'll figure this out.

240
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,480
<7-46,CASTLE>各位  有几个字母上面有蜜蜂
<7-46,CASTLE>Guys, some of the letters have little bees over them.

241

<7-46,CASTLE>-阿戴  -怎么回事
<7-46,CASTLE>- A-D-E... - What the hell?

244
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:23,550
<7-47,JUDAH>什么意思
<7-47,JUDAH>What does that mean?

245
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,640
<7-48,CASTLE>不知道  可能是个词  或是短语
<7-48,CASTLE>I don't know. It could be a word, maybe it's a phrase.

246
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,350
<7-48,CASTLE>"牛奶杆"  不对
<7-48,CASTLE>Uh, "Dairy pole"... no.

247
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:31,620
<7-48,CASTLE>"我玩实干家"
<7-48,CASTLE>"I play doer."

248
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:34,120
<7-48,CASTLE>"可怕的策略"
<7-48,CASTLE>"A dire ploy."

249
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,990
<7-49,SIMON>各位  他看上去不妙
<7-49,SIMON>Guys, he's not looking so good.

250
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:38,940
<7-50,CASTLE>等等
<7-50,CASTLE>Wait a minute.

251
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,790
<7-50,CASTLE>"玩

253
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,580
<7-50,CASTLE>就死"
<7-50,CASTLE>die."

254
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,510
<7-51,SIMON>天呐  太变态了
<7-51,SIMON>Oh, man. This is so twisted.

255
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:50,240
<7-52,TODD>谢天谢地
<7-52,TODD>Oh, thank God.

<7-53,JUDAH>快点  快点
<7-53,JUDAH>Hurry, hurry, hurry.

257
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,280
<7-54,CASTLE>准备好了吗
<7-54,CASTLE>Okay, ready?

258
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:57,610
<7-55,JUDAH>你做了什么
<7-55,JUDAH>What did you do to him?

259
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,080
<7-56,CASTLE>没什么  我就是...
<7-56,CASTLE>Nothing. I just put...

262
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,430
<7-57,CASTLE>是剧毒
<7-57,CASTLE>It says it's poison.

263
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:10,350
<7-50,CASTLE>什么
<7-50,CASTLE>What?

264
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:11,490
<7-43,SIMON>这不...
<7-43,SIMON>That's not...

265
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,610
<7-36,CASTLE>"拯救就在其中"
<7-36,CASTLE>"Salvation lies within."

266
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:16,010
<7-29,CASTLE>拯...撒谎
<7-29,CASTLE>Sa-- lies.

267
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:17,590
<7-57,CASTLE>是个骗局
<7-57,CASTLE>It was a trick.

268
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,020
<7-58,JUDAH>好了  好了
<7-58,JUDAH>Okay, okay.

269
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:22,400
<7-59,CASTLE>解开他的领子  让他呼吸
<7-59,CASTLE>Just open up his collar so he can breathe.

270
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,380
<7-60,CASTLE>那是什么
<7-60,CASTLE>What is that?

271
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,930
<7-61,SIMON>我们现在怎么办
<7-61,SIMON>So what the hell are we supposed to do now?

272
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,260
<7-62,CASTLE>我不知道
<7-62,CASTLE>I don't know.

282
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,130
<8-1,SIMON>你说得对
<8-1,SIMON>You were right.

283
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,850
<8-1,SIMON>幕后黑手不打算杀了我们
<8-1,SIMON>Whoever's behind this isn't gonna kill us.

284
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,160
<8-1,SIMON>他希望我们互相残杀
<8-1,SIMON>He wants us to kill each other.

285
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:53,640
<8-2,CASTLE>我...这上面还有一则线索
<8-2,CASTLE>I... There's another clue right here.

286
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,840
<8-3,SIMON>"时间不够了
<8-3,SIMON>"Time has run out.

287
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,860
<8-4,CASTLE>两个是解药
<8-4,CASTLE>" 2-will cure.

288
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,170
<8-1,SIMON>一个将致命"
<8-1,SIMON>1-will kill."

289
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,290
<8-2,CASTLE>那么这附近
<8-2,CASTLE>Okay, so that has to mean

290
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:00,070
<8-2,CASTLE>肯定有解药
<8-2,CASTLE>that there's a-an antidote around here somewhere.

291
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:02,060
<8-2,CASTLE>到处找找  各位  到处找找
<8-2,CASTLE>Look around. Guys, look around. Look around.

292
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:02,740
<8-3,SIMON>我们找什么
<8-3,SIMON>What are we looking for?

293
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,870
<8-4,CASTLE>这附近有什么东西
<8-4,CASTLE>Something around here.

294
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,460
<8-4,CASTLE>"两个是解药"  什么意思啊
<8-4,CASTLE>"2-will cure"... What does that mean?

295
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,890
<8-5,SIMON>还有一个注射器吗
<8-5,SIMON>Is it another injector?

296
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:08,670
<8-5,SIMON>"一个将致命"
<8-5,SIMON>"1-will kill..."

297
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,790
<8-5,SIMON>是针吗
<8-5,SIMON>Is it a needle?

298
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:13,040
<8-6,JUDAH>各位  我有发现
<8-6,JUDAH>Hey, guys, found something.

299
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,050
<8-6,JUDAH>"两个[2]是解药"
<8-6,JUDAH>"2-will cure."

300
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,690
<8-6,JUDAH>撑住  伙计
<8-6,JUDAH>Hang in there, buddy.

301
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:18,780
<8-6,JUDAH>这是二号
<8-6,JUDAH>This is number 2.

302
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:20,630
<8-6,JUDAH>我们给他2号就行
<8-6,JUDAH>We just got to give him number 2.

303
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:21,820
<8-6,JUDAH>等等  不对
<8-6,JUDAH>Wait, wait, no, wait, wait.

304
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:22,440
<8-7,CASTLE>不对劲
<8-7,CASTLE>Something's not right.

305
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,750
<8-7,CASTLE>这太简单了
<8-7,CASTLE>Um, it's too easy, too, uh,...

306
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:25,960
<8-8,JUDAH>但线索不就是这么说的吗
<8-8,JUDAH>But that's what the clue said.

307
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,780
<8-8,JUDAH>"两个是解药"
<8-8,JUDAH>"2-will cure."

308
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:27,490
<8-9,CASTLE>如果意思是
<8-9,CASTLE>What if that means

309
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:30,410
<8-9,CASTLE>两个针剂合用是解药呢
<8-9,CASTLE>a combination of two vials makes the antidote?

310
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:31,830
<8-10,SIMON>你说什么呢
<8-10,SIMON>What are you talking about?

311
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:34,990
<8-11,CASTLE>显然我们不能对线索想当然
<8-11,CASTLE>Well, clearly we can't take any of these clues for granted.

312
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:37,260
<8-11,CASTLE>"时间不够了"  这什么意思
<8-11,CASTLE>"Time has run out"... What does that mean?

313
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:40,990
<8-11,CASTLE>钟
<8-11,CASTLE>Okay, the clock...

314
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:42,730
<8-11,CASTLE>那台钟停了
<8-11,CASTLE>that clock has stopped.

315
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,270
<8-11,CASTLE>这就是"时间不够了[停止了]"
<8-11,CASTLE>Which is "Time has run out,"

316
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:46,660
<8-11,CASTLE>指针指的是1和3
<8-11,CASTLE>and the hands are at 1:00 and 3:00,

317
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:50,700
<8-11,CASTLE>那么  如果解药是
<8-11,CASTLE>so what if the antidote...

318
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:54,620
<8-11,CASTLE>1和3合起来呢
<8-11,CASTLE>1 and 3 vials combined.

319
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,240
<8-12,SIMON>天呐
<8-12,SIMON>Oh, man...

320
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,440
<8-13,JUDAH>这对吗
<8-13,JUDAH>I don't know.

321
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,680
<8-14,JUDAH>你确定吗
<8-14,JUDAH>You sure about this?

322
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:15,330
<8-15,SIMON>谢天谢地
<8-15,SIMON>Oh, thank God.

323
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:17,510
<8-16,CASTLE>你没事吧
<8-16,CASTLE>You all right?

324
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:18,860
<7-45,JUDAH>呼吸
<7-45,JUDAH>Just breathe.

325
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:19,990
<8-16,CASTLE>呼吸
<8-16,CASTLE>Breathe.

326
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,700
<9-1,BUCKLEY>好了  为什么找我来
<9-1,BUCKLEY>Okay. Why the hell am I here?

327
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,500
<9-2,ESPOSITO>巴克利先生
<9-2,ESPOSITO>Well, Mr. Buckley,

328
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,220
<9-2,ESPOSITO>我们得知你跟艾玛·马修斯有些问题
<9-2,ESPOSITO>we understand that you had some issues with Emma Matthews.

329
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,660
<9-3,BUCKLEY>我不知道你什么意思
<9-3,BUCKLEY>I don't know what you're talking about.

330
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:33,590
<9-3,BUCKLEY>我喜欢艾玛
<9-3,BUCKLEY>I liked Emma.

331
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:34,910
<9-3,BUCKLEY>她的遭遇太可惜了
<9-3,BUCKLEY>It's a real shame what happened to her.

332
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,540
<9-4,RYAN>是啊  你肯定心都碎了
<9-4,RYAN>Yeah, we're sure you're heartbroken,

333
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,530
<9-4,RYAN>尤其据说她还散布谣言
<9-4,RYAN>especially after she supposedly lied

334
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:40,640
<9-4,RYAN>害你没能在单位得到重要晋升
<9-4,RYAN>and beat you out of that big promotion at work.

335
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,420
<9-5,ESPOSITO>现在艾玛死了
<9-5,ESPOSITO>And now that Emma's dead,

336
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,280
<9-5,ESPOSITO>新工作肯定属于你了
<9-5,ESPOSITO>that new job is yours for the taking.

337
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:45,560
<9-5,ESPOSITO>等等
<9-5,ESPOSITO>Hold on.

338
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,510
<9-6,BUCKLEY>我或许并不为艾玛的死感到遗憾
<9-6,BUCKLEY>I may not be shedding tears over Emma's demise,

339
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:48,830
<9-6,BUCKLEY>但我也没杀她
<9-6,BUCKLEY>but I didn't kill her.

340
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:52,300
<9-7,RYAN>你有一辆白色拉姆350货车  是吧  巴克利先生
<9-7,RYAN>You own a white Ram 350 van, don't you, Mr. Buckley?

341
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:53,210
<9-8,BUCKLEY>是啊  怎么了
<9-8,BUCKLEY>Yeah. So?

342
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:54,890
<9-9,RYAN>艾玛遇害时
<9-9,RYAN>So a van matching that description

343
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:56,000
<9-9,RYAN>有人在她家外面
<9-9,RYAN>was seen outside Emma's place

344
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,280
<9-9,RYAN>见到了符合这一特征的车
<9-9,RYAN>during the time she was murdered.

345
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,690
<9-10,ESPOSITO>你昨晚9点到11点间在哪
<9-10,ESPOSITO>Where were you between 9:00 and 11:00 last night?

346
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,920
<9-11,BUCKLEY>布鲁克林的奥马利酒吧
<9-11,BUCKLEY>At O'Malley's Pub in Brooklyn.

347
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,690
<9-11,BUCKLEY>我的车就停在外面
<9-11,BUCKLEY>And my van was parked right out front.

348
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:05,810
<9-11,BUCKLEY>随便问那里的任何人
<9-11,BUCKLEY>Ask anyone there.

349
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:06,620
<9-12,ESPOSITO>我们会的
<9-12,ESPOSITO>We will.

350
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,890
<9-12,ESPOSITO>最好属实
<9-12,ESPOSITO>And it better check out.

351
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:10,100
<9-13,BUCKLEY>告诉你们
<9-13,BUCKLEY>And just so you guys know,

352
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,510
<9-13,BUCKLEY>艾玛的确说了关于我不实的话才得到了晋升
<9-13,BUCKLEY>Emma did lie about me to get that promotion.

353
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:14,290
<9-13,BUCKLEY>那小妞经常说谎
<9-13,BUCKLEY>That chick lied all the time.

354
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:15,430
<9-14,ESPOSITO>你说什么呢
<9-14,ESPOSITO>What are you talking about?

355
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:17,260
<9-15,BUCKLEY>昨天  我还撞见她在剪辑室
<9-15,BUCKLEY>Just yesterday I caught her in the edit bay

356
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:19,260
<9-15,BUCKLEY>数字化老录像带
<9-15,BUCKLEY>digitizing old VHS tapes.

357
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,440
<9-15,BUCKLEY>艾玛说是一则报道的证据
<9-15,BUCKLEY>Emma said it was proof for a story,

358
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,060
<9-15,BUCKLEY>但她在做的报道我都知道
<9-15,BUCKLEY>but I know all the stories she was working on,

359
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:25,280
<9-15,BUCKLEY>那些视频跟那些报道毫无关系
<9-15,BUCKLEY>and those videos had nothing to do with any of them.

360
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,500
<9-15,BUCKLEY>艾玛的同事不是说
<9-15,BUCKLEY>Wait, didn't Emma's co-worker

361
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,380
<9-16,RYAN>她发现了什么证据吗
<9-16,RYAN>say she just stumbled on some sort of proof?

362
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:31,000
<9-17,ESPOSITO>巴克利  带子上是什么内容
<9-17,ESPOSITO>Buckley, what was on those tapes?

363
00:14:30,010 --> 00:15:10,130
<9-17,ESPOSITO>最新美剧下载
<9-17,ESPOSITO>www.ZiMuZu.tv

364
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,720
<9-18,BUCKLEY>一段奇怪的家庭录影  几个孩子
<9-18,BUCKLEY>They were weird home videos of a couple of kids

365
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,210
<9-18,BUCKLEY>坐在那里  戴着奇怪的勋章
<9-18,BUCKLEY>sitting around wearing these strange medallions.

366
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:36,130
<9-19,ESPOSITO>怎么奇怪
<9-19,ESPOSITO>Strange how?

367
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:36,860
<9-19,ESPOSITO>我说不清
<9-19,ESPOSITO>I don't know.

368
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,490
<9-20,BUCKLEY>圆圆的符号
<9-20,BUCKLEY>They... They had round symbols.

369
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,140
<9-21,RYAN>这样的吗
<9-21,RYAN>Did they look anything like this?

370
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,630
<9-22,BUCKLEY>对  就是这样的
<9-22,BUCKLEY>Yeah. Exactly like that.

371
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,350
<9-23,RYAN>她在数字化的这些录像带有副本吗
<9-23,RYAN>Are there copies of these VHS tapes she was digitizing?

372
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:50,530
<9-24,BUCKLEY>嗯  系统会自动把原始影像
<9-24,BUCKLEY>Yeah. The system automatically archives the raw footage

373
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:52,120
<9-24,BUCKLEY>备份到服务器
<9-24,BUCKLEY>to the server for backup.

374
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,990
<10-1,CASTLE>你感觉如何
<10-1,CASTLE>How you feeling?

375
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:57,500
<10-2,TODD>好多了  谢谢你救了我
<10-2,TODD>Better. Thanks for saving me.

376
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,150
<10-3,CASTLE>我都不知道你的名字呢
<10-3,CASTLE>Hey, I don't even know your name.

377
00:14:59,160 --> 00:14:59,680
<10-4,TODD>是啊
<10-4,TODD>That's right.

378
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,270
<10-5,CASTLE>我们还没好好介绍过
<10-5,CASTLE>We haven't done proper introductions.

379
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:02,880
<10-6,TODD>-我是里克  -托德
<10-6,TODD>- I'm Rick. Todd.

382
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,250
<10-9,CASTLE>各位
<10-9,CASTLE>Well, gentlemen,

383
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,880
<10-9,CASTLE>显然  我们被带来是有原因的
<10-9,CASTLE>um, clearly we were all brought here for a reason.

384
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,770
<10-9,CASTLE>或许如果我们能想明白是什么原因  就能出去了
<10-9,CASTLE>Maybe if we can figure out what it is, it'll be our way out.

385
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:13,870
<10-10,TODD>好吧  怎么想
<10-10,TODD>Okay. How do we do that?

386
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:16,140
<10-11,CASTLE>我们跟彼此肯定有某种联系
<10-11,CASTLE>Well, we all must have some sort of connection to each other.

387
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:16,960
<10-11,CASTLE>但我这辈子
<10-11,CASTLE>Yeah, but I've never seen

388
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,820
<10-12,SIMON>从没见过你们任何一个
<10-12,SIMON>any of you guys in my life, ever.

389
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:21,080
<10-13,CASTLE>是啊  但或许这联系
<10-13,CASTLE>Right, but it may be some connection

390
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,840
<10-13,CASTLE>我们尚不了解
<10-13,CASTLE>we're not yet aware of.

391
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:24,630
<10-13,CASTLE>我是个悬疑作家
<10-13,CASTLE>Um, I'm a mystery writer.

392
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:25,710
<10-13,CASTLE>你们是做什么的
<10-13,CASTLE>What do you guys do for a living?

393
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:27,620
<10-14,SIMON>三年级老师
<10-14,SIMON>I'm a third-grade teacher.

<10-15,TODD>牧师
<10-15,TODD>I'm a minister.

395
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,180
<10-16,JUDAH>-拳击馆老板  -好吧
<10-16,JUDAH>- I own a boxing gym. - Okay. All right.

396
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:33,000
<10-17,CASTLE>没什么关联  你们是哪人
<10-17,CASTLE>No connection there, but, uh, where are you from?

397
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,380
<10-17,CASTLE>我是纽约市土生土长的
<10-17,CASTLE>I'm born and raised in New York City.

398
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,070
<10-18,JUDAH>悬疑作家  没人在乎我们为什么在这儿
<10-18,JUDAH>Hey, mystery writer, no one cares why we're here.

399
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:37,500
<10-18,JUDAH>我们只想出去
<10-18,JUDAH>We only care about getting out.

400
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,700
<10-19,SIMON>-我同意  -我也是
<10-19,SIMON>- I'm with him. - Me too.

401
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,870
<10-20,TODD>这里肯定有什么东西我们能用来逃跑
<10-20,TODD>There's got to be something in here we can use to escape.

402
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:44,290
<10-20,TODD>那个  犹大
<10-20,TODD>You know what, Judah,

403
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:45,800
<10-21,CASTLE>我们上次打破了一样东西时
<10-21,CASTLE>the last time we broke something,

404
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,830
<10-21,CASTLE>托德差点丧命
<10-21,CASTLE>Todd nearly died.

405
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:49,210
<10-22,JUDAH>哥们  可不是我给他注射了
<10-22,JUDAH>Hey, pal, I'm not the one who injected him

406
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:50,070
<10-22,JUDAH>毒药  好吗
<10-22,JUDAH>with poison, okay?

407
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,480
<10-23,CASTLE>我就是这个意思
<10-23,CASTLE>That's exactly my point.

408
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,630
<10-23,CASTLE>到处乱翻
<10-23,CASTLE>Rummaging around

409
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:55,360
<10-23,CASTLE>或许会不慎启动另一个死亡陷阱
<10-23,CASTLE>may inadvertently activate another deadly trap.

410
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,690
<10-24,TODD>-我们总得做点什么  -同意
<10-24,TODD>- We got to do something. - Agreed.

411
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:05,870
<10-25,CASTLE>所以我们放聪明点吧
<10-25,CASTLE>So let's be smart about it.

412
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,110
<10-25,CASTLE>密码筒
<10-25,CASTLE>Um, the cryptex...

413
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,900
<10-25,CASTLE>让我们发现了毒药
<10-25,CASTLE>I-It led us to the poison,

414
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,210
<10-25,CASTLE>毒药让我们发现了解药
<10-25,CASTLE>and the poison led us to the antidote.

415
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:14,660
<10-26,SIMON>是啊  但解药上面没有线索
<10-26,SIMON>Yeah, but there was no clue on the antidote.

416
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:17,980
<10-27,CASTLE>钟也是谜底的一部分
<10-27,CASTLE>The clock was part of that solution.

417
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,480
<10-27,CASTLE>或许
<10-27,CASTLE>Maybe...

418
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,070
<10-27,CASTLE>它有下一个线索
<10-27,CASTLE>it holds the next clue.

419
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,890
<10-28,CASTLE>"钥匙能释放你们"
<10-28,CASTLE>"The key will release you."

420
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,750
<10-28,CASTLE>什么钥匙
<10-28,CASTLE>But what key?

421
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:36,700
<11-1,HAYLEY SHIPTON>阿丽克西斯  你父亲呢
<11-1,HAYLEY SHIPTON>Alexis, where is your father?

422
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,260
<11-2,ALEXIS>他没跟你在一起吗
<11-2,ALEXIS>He's not with you?

423
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:41,090
<11-3,HAYLEY>如果是那样  我还会问吗
<11-3,HAYLEY>If he were, would I be asking you where he is?

424
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:43,600
<11-5,HAYLEY>抱歉  抱歉
<11-5,HAYLEY>Okay, sorry, sorry.

425
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,680
<11-5,HAYLEY>不是有意那么冲的
<11-5,HAYLEY>I don't mean to get so bitchy.

426
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,250
<11-5,HAYLEY>只是你父亲没去参加我安排的
<11-5,HAYLEY>It's just that your father blew off that meeting

427
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,820
<11-5,HAYLEY>跟潜在客户的见面
<11-5,HAYLEY>I set up with potential clients.

428
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,030
<11-6,ALEXIS>他今早临时安排了
<11-6,ALEXIS>He had an impromptu get-together

429
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:52,080
<11-6,ALEXIS>跟史蒂芬·金的见面  或许他还没走
<11-6,ALEXIS>this morning with Stephen King... maybe he's still there.

430
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,770
<11-7,HAYLEY>-你有金的号码吗  -没有
<11-7,HAYLEY>- Do you have King's number? - No.

431
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:55,290
<11-8,ALEXIS>但他的助理给我爸打了电话
<11-8,ALEXIS>But his assistant called my Dad's cell,

432
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,060
<11-8,ALEXIS>而电话是与办公室电脑相连的
<11-8,ALEXIS>which is linked to the office computer.

433
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:59,740
<11-8,ALEXIS>好了  这是他的电话记录
<11-8,ALEXIS>Okay, here's his call log.

434
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:00,880
<11-8,ALEXIS>知道了
<11-8,ALEXIS>Got it.

435
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,880
<11-9,ALEXIS>抱歉  此号码...
<11-9,ALEXIS>We're sorry, you have reached a number...

436
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,380
<11-9,ALEXIS>不通
<11-9,ALEXIS>It's disconnected.

437
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:11,360
<11-9,ALEXIS>我肯定是打错了
<11-9,ALEXIS>I must have misdialed.

438
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:17,230
<11-9,ALEXIS>抱歉  此号码...
<11-9,ALEXIS>We're sorry, you have reached a number...

439
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:18,470
<11-10,HAYLEY>不对劲
<11-10,HAYLEY>Something's wrong.

440
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,100
<11-10,HAYLEY>嗯  史蒂芬·金的新推文
<11-10,HAYLEY>Yeah, there's a new tweet from Stephen King...

441
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:22,640
<11-10,HAYLEY>"20分钟后看澳大利亚直播节目《晚7点企划》
<11-10,HAYLEY>"Watch me live on Australia's '7PM Project'

442
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,730
<11-10,HAYLEY>有我出镜"
<11-10,HAYLEY>in 20 minutes."

443
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:26,520
<11-11,ALEXIS>如果史蒂芬·金在澳大利亚
<11-11,ALEXIS>If Stephen King is in Australia...

444
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,130
<11-11,ALEXIS>那我爸在哪
<11-11,ALEXIS>where's my Dad?

445
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:31,250
<11-11,ALEXIS>"钥匙能释放你们"  什么钥匙啊
<11-11,ALEXIS>"The key will release you," but what key?

446
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,180
<12-1,SIMON>或许是比喻
<12-1,SIMON>Maybe it's a metaphor.

447
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,130
<12-2,JUDAH>或许你是个白痴
<12-2,JUDAH>Maybe you're an idiot.

448
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:35,470
<12-2,JUDAH>你能不能闭上嘴  让大人好好思考
<12-2,JUDAH>Now, will you please shut up so the grown-ups can think?

449
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:37,560
<12-3,CASTLE>各位  吵嘴对我们没有帮助
<12-3,CASTLE>Guys, the bickering is not gonna help us.

450
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:39,950
<12-4,TODD>或许这屋里有什么东西
<12-4,TODD>Maybe there's something in this room

451
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:41,630
<12-4,TODD>跟这个钥匙孔是一个形状
<12-4,TODD>that's shaped like this keyhole.

452
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:44,290
<12-5,CASTLE>我在哪见过这个形状的
<12-5,CASTLE>Yeah, I know I've seen that shape before.

453
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,830
<12-5,CASTLE>伙计们  我们能出去了
<12-5,CASTLE>Boys, we're getting out of here.

454
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:03,140
<12-6,JUDAH>拜托
<12-6,JUDAH>Oh, come on.

455
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,800
<12-6,JUDAH>"最后剩下的人将得到自由"
<12-6,JUDAH>"The last one standing will be freed."

456
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:22,020
<12-7,CASTLE>三颗子弹  我们四个人
<12-7,CASTLE>Three bullets, four of us.

457
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,070
<12-7,CASTLE>怎么
<12-7,CASTLE>So, what?

458
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,620
<12-8,SIMON>杀了其他人的人就可以走了吗
<12-8,SIMON>Whoever kills the others goes free?

459
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,420
<12-9,JUDAH>把枪给我  里克
<12-9,JUDAH>Give me the gun, Rick.

460
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,130
<12-10,SIMON>不不  把枪给我
<12-10,SIMON>No, no, no. I want the gun!

461
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:38,720
<12-11,TODD>你俩  够了
<12-11,TODD>Both of you, stop!

462
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:41,140
<12-12,CASTLE>停下
<12-12,CASTLE>Stop it.

463
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:44,290
<12-12,CASTLE>否则  幕后黑手就要赢了  你们不明白吗
<12-12,CASTLE>If you don't, whoever's behind this wins, don't you see?

464
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,310
<12-13,TODD>你还不明白我们别无选择吗
<12-13,TODD>Don't you see we're powerless in here?

465
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,640
<12-13,TODD>不是的
<12-13,TODD>No, we're not.

466
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:50,580
<12-14,CASTLE>我们可以不玩
<12-14,CASTLE>We have the power not to play.

467
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,450
<13-3,BECKETT>听到了吗
<13-3,BECKETT>You hear that?

468
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:55,970
<12-14,CASTLE>我不要再玩你的变态游戏了
<12-14,CASTLE>We're not gonna play your sick, little game anymore.

469
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:57,440
<12-14,CASTLE>你输了
<12-14,CASTLE>You lose.

470
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:04,830
<12-15,CASTLE>是另一个房间
<12-15,CASTLE>It's another room.

471
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,440
<12-15,CASTLE>跟这个一样
<12-15,CASTLE>It's identical to this one.

472
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,180
<12-15,CASTLE>梅多
<12-15,CASTLE>Meadow.

473
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,870
<12-16,SIMON>我妻子怎么在那里
<12-16,SIMON>What's my wife doing in there?

474
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,670
<12-17,JUDAH>那是我女朋友  帕蒂
<12-17,JUDAH>That's my girlfriend, Patty.

476
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:26,780
<13-1,MEADOW>是一模一样的
<13-1,MEADOW>It's exactly the same.

477
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,340
<13-2,PATTY>一切都一模一样
<13-2,PATTY>Everything's the same.

478
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:29,930
<13-3,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<13-3,BECKETT>Castle?

479
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:31,130
<13-3,BECKETT>你听得到吗
<13-3,BECKETT>Do you hear me?

480
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,520
<13-3,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<13-3,BECKETT>Castle?

481
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:33,870
<13-3,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<13-3,BECKETT>Castle?

482
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,010
<13-4,MEADOW>那是我丈夫  西蒙
<13-4,MEADOW>That was my husband, Simon.

483
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,390
<13-5,PATTY>还有我的男友
<13-5,PATTY>And my boyfriend.

484
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:41,060
<13-6,BECKETT>这也刚好解释了他们手机发来
<13-6,BECKETT>Which explains the text that they used

485
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,020
<13-6,BECKETT>引我们到这里的短信
<13-6,BECKETT>to lure us here.

486
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,910
<13-6,BECKETT>幕后黑手先劫持了他们
<13-6,BECKETT>They must have been abducted first

487
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:45,900
<13-6,BECKETT>然后用他们的手机给我们发短信
<13-6,BECKETT>and then their phones were used to text us.

488
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:46,780
<13-7,PATTY>但为什么
<13-7,PATTY>But why?

489
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,750
<13-8,BECKETT>更重要的是  谁是那第四个人
<13-8,BECKETT>More importantly, who's that fourth man?

490
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,520
<13-9,PATTY>什么
<13-9,PATTY>What?

491
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,260
<13-10,MEADOW>对  屏幕上有四个人
<13-10,MEADOW>Yeah, there were four guys on that screen

492
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:54,030
<13-10,MEADOW>但咱们这只有三个
<13-10,MEADOW>but only three of us.

493
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:55,260
<13-11,PATTY>那个本该出现
<13-11,PATTY>What happened to the woman

494
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,900
<13-11,PATTY>在这张椅子上的女人出了什么事
<13-11,PATTY>that was supposed to be in that chair?

495
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,490
<13-12,BECKETT>你脖子上是什么
<13-12,BECKETT>What is that on your neck?

496
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:02,590
<13-13,PATTY>什么
<13-13,PATTY>What?

497
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:05,570
<13-14,MEADOW>这是什么
<13-14,MEADOW>What is it?

498
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:09,840
<13-15,PATTY>你也有一个
<13-15,PATTY>You have one, too.

499
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,970
<13-16,MEADOW>我呢
<13-16,MEADOW>What about me?

500
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:12,880
<13-17,PATTY>没有
<13-17,PATTY>No.

501
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:14,470
<13-18,MEADOW>那这是好事还是坏事
<13-18,MEADOW>Well, is that a good thing or a bad thing?

502
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:17,110
<13-19,BECKETT>我不知道  但要紧的是保持冷静
<13-19,BECKETT>I don't know, but the important thing here is to stay calm.

503
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,370
<13-20,MEADOW>去你的冷静
<13-20,MEADOW>Screw calm!

504
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:20,880
<13-20,MEADOW>我说咱们打碎玻璃  把这里砸开出去
<13-20,MEADOW>I say we break that glass and hack our way out of here.

505
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,020
<13-21,BECKETT>-不  那不是好主意  -谁管你
<13-21,BECKETT>- No, that's not a good idea. - Tough.

506
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:25,300
<13-22,MEADOW>如果这不是紧急情况  我不晓得什么还算
<13-22,MEADOW>If this isn't an emergency, I don't know what is.

507
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,700
<13-23,BECKETT>听着  幕后黑手无论是谁  都不会
<13-23,BECKETT>Look, whoever is behind this isn't stupid enough

508
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,380
<13-23,BECKETT>蠢到给我们留下能够破门而出的工具
<13-23,BECKETT>to leave something that we can use to go free,

509
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,080
<13-23,BECKETT>就是说那是个陷阱
<13-23,BECKETT>which means that's a trap.

510
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:36,070
<13-23,BECKETT>现在还是完成这个谜题  看看会发生什么
<13-23,BECKETT>Now let's just finish this puzzle and see what happens.

511
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,360
<13-24,MEADOW>好吧
<13-24,MEADOW>Fine.

512
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,220
<13-24,MEADOW>你们尽情玩吧
<13-24,MEADOW>Knock yourself out.

513
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,010
<13-25,PATTY>这里有些很熟悉的感觉
<13-25,PATTY>Something about this feels familiar.

514
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:50,750
<13-26,BECKETT>什么意思
<13-26,BECKETT>What do you mean?

515
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:53,380
<13-27,PATTY>同样的房间  任务
<13-27,PATTY>Identical rooms, the tasks --

516
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,200
<13-27,PATTY>我在研究生院时读过一则案例
<13-27,PATTY>in grad school I read a case study

517
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,990
<13-27,PATTY>检验在压力环境下的分离焦虑
<13-27,PATTY>that examines separation anxiety in stressful situations.

518
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,740
<13-28,MEADOW>这块当然是压力环境
<13-28,MEADOW>Well, this certainly is stressful.

519
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,200
<13-29,MEADOW>谢天谢地
<13-29,MEADOW>Oh. Thank God.

520
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,220
<13-30,BECKETT>你在干嘛
<13-30,BECKETT>What are you doing?

521
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:07,410
<13-31,MEADOW>抽根烟  我遭了罪  还不享受一下
<13-31,MEADOW>Having a smoke. I think I've earned it.

522
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:08,180
<13-31,MEADOW>不行
<13-31,MEADOW>No!

523
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:12,920
<13-32,BECKETT>我告诉过你  你不能相信这地方的所有东西
<13-32,BECKETT>I told you -- you can't trust anything in this place.

524
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,130
<13-32,BECKETT>可能会杀死你
<13-32,BECKETT>This could kill you.

525
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,340
<13-33,MEADOW>这是香烟
<13-33,MEADOW>It's a cigarette.

526
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,390
<13-33,MEADOW>当然最终会害死我
<13-33,MEADOW>It's definitely gonna kill me eventually.

527
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,680
<13-34,MEADOW>这又是什么
<13-34,MEADOW>What the hell is that?

528
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,770
<13-35,BECKETT>闻起来像花生
<13-35,BECKETT>It smells like peanuts.

529
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:30,480
<13-36,MEADOW>我对花生过敏
<13-36,MEADOW>I'm allergic.

530
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,310
<13-37,PATTY>看起来贝克特警监
<13-37,PATTY>Looks like Captain Beckett

531
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:33,550
<13-37,PATTY>救了你一命
<13-37,PATTY>just saved your life.

532
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:35,540
<13-37,PATTY>你开始团队合作  好吗
<13-37,PATTY>So how about you start being a team player?

533
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:37,300
<13-38,BECKETT>我要你来告诉我
<13-38,BECKETT>I need you to tell me

534
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,430
<13-38,BECKETT>有关那个案例的所有事情
<13-38,BECKETT>everything you can about this study.

535
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:51,160
<14-1,SIMON>我老婆在哪里干啥  还有你们的
<14-1,SIMON>What the hell is my wife doing in here, and yours?

536
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,510
<14-2,JUDAH>他们一定是人质
<14-2,JUDAH>They must be leverage

537
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,940
<14-2,JUDAH>为了逼迫我们服从命令  否则她们可能受伤害
<14-2,JUDAH>to make us follow the rules or else they get hurt.

538
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,270
<14-3,CASTLE>或者我们是人质
<14-3,CASTLE>Or maybe we're the leverage.

539
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:57,370
<14-4,JUDAH>那托德呢
<14-4,JUDAH>And what about Todd?

540
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:58,940
<14-4,JUDAH>他在那边谁也没有
<14-4,JUDAH>He didn't have anyone in that room.

541
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,420
<14-5,SIMON>他是个神父  是独身者
<14-5,SIMON>He's a priest. They're celibate.

542
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,730
<14-6,TODD>我是牧师  规矩不同的
<14-6,TODD>I'm a minister. The rules are different.

543
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:06,130
<14-7,SIMON>所以有位牧师太太  但不在里面
<14-7,SIMON>So is there a Mrs. Minister that's not in there?

544
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,050
<14-8,TODD>不  但这不意味着
<14-8,TODD>No, but that doesn't mean

545
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:08,880
<14-8,TODD>没有我在乎的人
<14-8,TODD>there aren't people I care about.

546
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,290
<14-8,TODD>如果他们中任何人出了事
<14-8,TODD>And if something happened to one of them --

547
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:11,810
<14-9,CASTLE>我们不确知
<14-9,CASTLE>Look, we don't know enough

548
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:13,190
<14-9,CASTLE>你需要担心的这些  好吗
<14-9,CASTLE>for you to be worried about that, okay?

549
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:15,260
<14-10,SIMON>老天  锁在在房间里  一只装了子弹的手枪
<14-10,SIMON>Ah, hell, being locked in this room with a loaded gun

550
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,620
<14-10,SIMON>让相互杀戮的指示
<14-10,SIMON>and instructions to kill one another

551
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,910
<14-10,SIMON>足够让我担心了
<14-10,SIMON>is plenty to be worried about.

552
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:19,410
<14-10,SIMON>我们不会那么做的
<14-10,SIMON>We're not gonna do that.

553
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:20,880
<14-11,CASTLE>我们要做的是想明白
<14-11,CASTLE>What we should be doing is figuring out

554
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,090
<14-11,CASTLE>为什么我们会在这里
<14-11,CASTLE>why the hell we're here.

555
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:24,020
<14-12,JUDAH>还有为什么有些人被打上那种标志
<14-12,JUDAH>And why are some of us marked with this symbol

556
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,130
<14-12,JUDAH>另些人没有
<14-12,JUDAH>and others aren't.

557
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,960
<14-13,CASTLE>女人中有人有那标志吗
<14-13,CASTLE>Did you see the symbol on any of the women?

558
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:30,430
<14-14,JUDAH>我看到派翠西脖子上有东西  但我没有
<14-14,JUDAH>I saw something on Patricia's neck, but I don't have one.

559
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:32,360
<14-15,CASTLE>-你老婆呢  -没有
<14-15,CASTLE>- And what about your wife? - No.

560
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,130
<14-16,SIMON>你确定
<14-16,SIMON>You sure?

561
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:34,570
<14-18,SIMON>我眼睛没有离开过她
<14-18,SIMON>I didn't take my eyes off of her.

562
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:36,260
<14-19,CASTLE>所以她没有而你有
<14-19,CASTLE>So she doesn't have one but you do.

563
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:38,620
<14-19,CASTLE>根据这个规律  贝克特一定有
<14-19,CASTLE>Following that pattern, Beckett must have one

564
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:39,740
<14-19,CASTLE>因为我没有
<14-19,CASTLE>because I don't.

565
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:42,870
<14-20,SIMON>什么意思
<14-20,SIMON>Meaning what?

566
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:45,940
<14-21,CASTLE>如果有标志的人
<14-21,CASTLE>Well, what if the people with the symbol

567
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:49,790
<14-21,CASTLE>是重要的目标  其他人只是人质
<14-21,CASTLE>are the important ones and the rest of us are leverage?

568
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:57,610
<15-1,HAYLEY>他在那里
<15-1,HAYLEY>There he is.

569
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,920
<15-2,ALEXIS>他在那里做什么
<15-2,ALEXIS>What's he doing in there?

570
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:16,000
<15-2,ALEXIS>等一下  那辆货车什么情况
<15-2,ALEXIS>Wait, what's going on with that van?

571
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:29,600
<15-3,ALEXIS>到底出了什么事
<15-3,ALEXIS>Uh, what the hell just happened?

572
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:32,900
<15-4,ALEXIS>那是我爸爸吗
<15-4,ALEXIS>Was that my dad?

573
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:36,070
<15-4,ALEXIS>所以巴克利送来了
<15-4,ALEXIS>So, Buckley sent over those tapes

574
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:37,810
<16-1,RYAN>艾玛转换过的录像带
<16-1,RYAN>that Emma was digitizing.

575
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:38,850
<16-2,ESPOSITO>然后
<16-2,ESPOSITO>And?

576
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,530
<16-3,RYAN>他是对的
<16-3,RYAN>Well, he's right.

577
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:42,580
<16-3,RYAN>很奇怪
<16-3,RYAN>It's, uh, weird.

578
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:49,440
<16-4,ESPOSITO>他们在干嘛
<16-4,ESPOSITO>What are they doing?

579
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:53,610
<16-5,RYAN>解谜题  持续多个小时
<16-5,RYAN>Solving puzzles. For hours.

580
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:57,890
<16-5,RYAN>他们戴着那个标识  像巴克利所说的
<16-5,RYAN>And they're wearing the symbol, just like Buckley said.

581
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:00,760
<16-6,ESPOSITO>那个小女孩是艾玛吗
<16-6,ESPOSITO>Could that little girl be Emma?

582
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,660
<16-7,RYAN>有可能
<16-7,RYAN>It's possible.

583
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,650
<16-7,RYAN>根据衣着和图像质量
<16-7,RYAN>Based on clothing and picture quality,

584
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:07,610
<16-7,RYAN>实验室认为录像带最少是20年前的
<16-7,RYAN>the lab thinks that the tape is at least 20 years old.

585
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:11,560
<16-8,ESPOSITO>如果是爱玛  那小男孩是谁
<16-8,ESPOSITO>If it is Emma, then who's that little boy

586
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:14,640
<16-8,ESPOSITO>这些录像带和她被谋杀有什么关系
<16-8,ESPOSITO>and what do these videos have to do with her murder?

587
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:16,680
<16-9,GIRL>我害怕
<16-9,GIRL>I'm scared.

588
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:19,480
<16-9,GIRL>我再不想玩这个游戏了
<16-9,GIRL>I don't want to play this game anymore.

589
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,950
<16-9,GIRL>求求你  让我出去
<16-9,GIRL>Please, let me out.

590
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:31,860
<16-11,ALEXIS>老爸丢了  我们也联系不到贝克特的手机
<16-11,ALEXIS>Dad's missing and we can't reach Beckett's cell.

591
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:33,160
<16-12,ESPOSITO>打住  打住
<16-12,ESPOSITO>Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on, hold on.

592
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,660
<16-12,ESPOSITO>贝克特在一个法医会议上  阿丽克西斯
<16-12,ESPOSITO>Beckett's at a forensics conference, Alexis.

593
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:37,780
<16-13,ALEXIS>不  她没有出现
<16-13,ALEXIS>No. She never showed.

594
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,660
<16-14,HAYLEY>里奇今早被引进了一栋空楼
<16-14,HAYLEY>Rick was lured into an empty building this morning.

595
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,520
<16-14,HAYLEY>我黑进了邻近街边的摄像头
<16-14,HAYLEY>I hacked a nearby street camera and got footage

596
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,070
<16-14,HAYLEY>发现一辆白色货车逃离现场
<16-14,HAYLEY>of a white van fleeing the scene.

597
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,860
<16-15,ESPOSITO>邻居看到艾玛家门前停了辆白色货车
<16-15,ESPOSITO>Neighbors saw a white van in front of Emma's building.

598
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:47,790
<16-16,ALEXIS>艾玛是谁
<16-16,ALEXIS>Who's Emma?

599
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,020
<16-17,RYAN>谋杀案被害人
<16-17,RYAN>A murder victim.

600
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:52,590
<16-17,RYAN>我们认为杀害她的凶手
<16-17,RYAN>We think her killer

601
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:54,670
<16-17,RYAN>也许开着一辆生锈的白色货车
<16-17,RYAN>might have been have been driving a rusty white van.

602
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:03,930
<17-1,BECKETT>如果线索是正确的  那么这一定就是钥匙
<17-1,BECKETT>If the clue is right, this must be the key.

603
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:06,540
<17-2,MEADOW>我收回对你所有的冷言恶语
<17-2,MEADOW>I take back every bad thing i've been thinking about you.

604
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:08,840
<17-3,BECKETT>是吗  谢了
<17-3,BECKETT>Yeah, well, thank you.

605
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,390
<17-4,PATTY>又是一个智力游戏
<17-4,PATTY>Just another mind game.

606
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,500
<17-5,BECKETT>"最后剩下的人将得到自由"
<17-5,BECKETT>"The last one standing will be freed."

607
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:30,370
<17-6,BECKETT>两发子弹
<17-6,BECKETT>Two bullets.

608
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:32,360
<17-7,PATTY>三个人
<17-7,PATTY>And three of us.

609
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:36,440
<17-7,PATTY>很显然抓我们的人想让我们自相残杀
<17-7,PATTY>Clearly our captor's trying to turn us against each other.

610
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,810
<17-8,PATTY>这是什么变态的新考验
<17-8,PATTY>What kind of sick new test is this?

611
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:42,460
<17-9,BECKETT>我不知道  不过它似乎不那么复杂
<17-9,BECKETT>I don't know, but it seems a little unsophisticated.

612
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,480
<17-10,PATTY>梅多
<17-10,PATTY>Meadow!

613
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,510
<17-10,PATTY>你在干什么
<17-10,PATTY>What are you doing?

614
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:48,280
<17-11,MEADOW>这叫做适者生存
<17-11,MEADOW>It's called survival of the fittest.

615
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,830
<18-1,CASTLE>还是混凝土
<18-1,CASTLE>Just more concrete.

616
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,120
<18-1,CASTLE>归在"意料之中"类别
<18-1,CASTLE>Which falls under the "To be expected" column.

617
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,010
<18-2,TODD>不
<18-2,TODD>Oh, no.

618
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:13,860
<18-3,SIMON>对不起  哥们
<18-3,SIMON>Sorry, boys.

619
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:16,100
<18-3,SIMON>我妻子做得对
<18-3,SIMON>My wife's got the right idea.

620
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:24,710
<19-1,PATTY>梅多  你不必这么做
<19-1,PATTY>Meadow, you don't have to do this.

621
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:26,300
<19-2,MEADOW>听着  这无关个人感情
<19-2,MEADOW>Look, it's nothing personal.

622
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,580
<19-3,BECKETT>把枪给我  梅多
<19-3,BECKETT>Give me the gun, Meadow.

623
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:29,970
<19-3,BECKETT>杀了我们并不能让你从这里出去
<19-3,BECKETT>Shooting us isn't gonna get you out of here any faster.

624
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:31,430
<19-4,MEADOW>很抱歉  但不是你死就是我亡
<19-4,MEADOW>I'm sorry, but it's you or me.

625
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:40,240
<21-5,MEADOW>西蒙
<21-5,MEADOW>Simon...

626
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:44,190
<20-1,CASTLE>杀了我们并不会让那道门打开
<20-1,CASTLE>shooting us is not gonna get that door open.

627
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:45,330
<20-1,CASTLE>你又不知道
<20-1,CASTLE>You don't know that.

628
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,440
<20-2,SIMON>字条上说只有一个人能幸存
<20-2,SIMON>The note says only one will survive.

629
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:49,200
<20-2,SIMON>我得让那个人是我
<20-2,SIMON>I need to make sure it's me.

630
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:53,340
<20-3,TODD>别走上这条绝路
<20-3,TODD>Don't go down this path.

631
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:57,150
<20-4,SIMON>抱歉  牧师
<20-4,SIMON>Sorry, Preacher.

632
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,040
<20-5,TODD>他死了
<20-5,TODD>He's dead.

633
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:20,540
<20-6,CASTLE>枪管被封死了
<20-6,CASTLE>The barrel is sealed.

634
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,820
<20-6,CASTLE>这把枪就像这房间一样被动过手脚
<20-6,CASTLE>The gun's as rigged as this room.

635
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,610
<21-1,BECKETT>戴真手铐之前先用这个吧
<21-1,BECKETT>Until I get you into real handcuffs.

636
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:32,390
<21-1,BECKETT>拜托
<21-1,BECKETT>Come on.

637
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,980
<21-2,MEADOW>我们不能握手言和吗
<21-2,MEADOW>Can't we work something out?

638
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:35,950
<21-3,PATTY>你想杀了我们
<21-3,PATTY>You tried to kill us.

639
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:37,500
<21-3,PATTY>如果她没把子弹取出来
<21-3,PATTY>If she hadn't taken the bullets out,

640
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,410
<21-3,PATTY>你就动手了
<21-3,PATTY>you would have.

641
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,730
<21-4,MEADOW>我那时候已经不是自己了
<21-4,MEADOW>I wasn't myself.

642
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:42,730
<21-4,MEADOW>战逃反应  纯粹是动物本能
<21-4,MEADOW>It was fight or flight, pure animal instinct.

643
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:49,700
<21-5,MEADOW>不  西蒙
<21-5,MEADOW>No. Simon.

644
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:00,970
<21-6,BECKETT>我非常抱歉
<21-6,BECKETT>I'm so sorry.

645
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:01,810
<21-7,MEADOW>算了吧
<21-7,MEADOW>Save it.

646
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:03,270
<21-7,MEADOW>你的丈夫杀了他
<21-7,MEADOW>Your husband killed him.

647
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:05,660
<21-8,BECKETT>我们不知道那是不是真的
<21-8,BECKETT>We don't know that.

648
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,020
<21-9,MEADOW>离我远点
<21-9,MEADOW>Get away from me.

649
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,620
<21-9,MEADOW>我们该怎么做
<21-9,MEADOW>What are we gonna do?

650
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,280
<21-10,PATTY>这对抓我们的人来说就是一场游戏
<21-10,PATTY>This is all a game to our captor.

651
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,630
<21-10,PATTY>我们在任人摆布
<21-10,PATTY>We're being manipulated.

652
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,550
<21-11,BECKETT>我们要改变规则
<21-11,BECKETT>We're gonna change the rules.

653
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,130
<22-1,ESPOSITO>你有消息的时候打电话给我
<22-1,ESPOSITO>Just give me a call whenever you hear something.

654
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:27,260
<22-2,RYAN>有线索了
<22-2,RYAN>Hey. I got something.

655
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:28,410
<22-2,RYAN>维克拉姆仔细排查了录像
<22-2,RYAN>Vikram scrubbed the footage.

656
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:29,540
<22-2,RYAN>他发现一个智力玩具下方写着
<22-2,RYAN>He found the name "Northcliff"

657
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:30,940
<22-2,RYAN>"诺斯克利夫"这个名字
<22-2,RYAN>written at the bottom of one of the puzzles.

658
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,380
<22-2,RYAN>艾玛十几岁的时候
<22-2,RYAN>Now, when Emma was a teenager,

659
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,980
<22-2,RYAN>她曾经替一对精神病专家夫妻遛狗
<22-2,RYAN>she walked dogs for a pair of psychiatrists --

660
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:37,730
<22-2,RYAN>乔福瑞·诺斯克利夫和萨曼莎·诺斯克利夫
<22-2,RYAN>Geoffrey and Samantha Northcliff.

661
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:40,590
<22-3,ESPOSITO>进展不错
<22-3,ESPOSITO>This is good.

662
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:41,970
<22-4,RYAN>更好的在后面
<22-4,RYAN>Yeah, and it gets better.

663
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:44,630
<22-4,RYAN>艾玛被谋杀的前晚
<22-4,RYAN>There was a break-in at the Northcliffs' apartment

664
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:46,200
<22-4,RYAN>诺斯克利夫夫妇的公寓遭到了入室偷窃
<22-4,RYAN>the night before Emma was murdered.

665
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,390
<22-4,RYAN>警方报告表明
<22-4,RYAN>According to the police report,

666
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:50,000
<22-4,RYAN>唯一丢失的私人物品

667
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:50,880
<22-5,ESPOSITO>VHS录像带
<22-5,ESPOSITO>The VHS tapes.

668
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,580
<22-5,ESPOSITO>一定是她闯进去偷那些录像带的
<22-5,ESPOSITO>She must have broken in to steal them.

669
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:53,210
<22-6,RYAN>但是为什么
<22-6,RYAN>But why?

670
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:54,420
<22-7,ESPOSITO>我们去问问诺斯克利夫夫妇
<22-7,ESPOSITO>Let's ask the Northcliffs.

671
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:55,200
<22-8,RYAN>我找不到他们
<22-8,RYAN>I can't find them.

672
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,860
<22-8,RYAN>但是我把他们的秘书带到审讯室了
<22-8,RYAN>But I've got their secretary in the box right now.

673
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:58,620
<22-9,ESPOSITO>很好
<22-9,ESPOSITO>All right.

674
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:00,830
<23-1,ROSE>真是一场悲剧
<23-1,ROSE>So much tragedy.

675
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:04,180
<23-1,ROSE>我在艾玛十几岁之后就再也没见过她了
<23-1,ROSE>I hadn't seen Emma since she was a teenager.

676
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,460
<23-1,ROSE>然后上周我在费耶的葬礼上遇到了她
<23-1,ROSE>And then I ran into her last week at Fay's funeral.

677
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:09,280
<23-2,ESPOSITO>谁的葬礼
<23-2,ESPOSITO>Whose funeral?

678
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,560
<23-3,ROSE>费耶·诺斯克利夫
<23-3,ROSE>Fay Northcliff --

679
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:12,250
<23-3,ROSE>乔福瑞和萨曼莎的女儿
<23-3,ROSE>Geoffrey and Samantha's daughter.

680
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,210
<23-4,RYAN>她发生了什么
<23-4,RYAN>What happened to her?

681
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,680
<23-5,ROSE>她上吊自杀了
<23-5,ROSE>She hung herself.

682
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:15,970
<23-5,ROSE>可怜的孩子
<23-5,ROSE>The poor girl.

683
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:19,000
<23-6,RYAN>她有什么兄弟姐妹吗
<23-6,RYAN>Did she have any siblings?

684
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:21,110
<23-7,ROSE>有一个双胞胎弟弟  布兰登
<23-7,ROSE>Yes. A twin brother, Brandon.

685
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,420
<23-8,RYAN>-这两个人是你说的双胞胎吗  -是的
<23-8,RYAN>- And are these the twins, right here? - Yes.

686
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,640
<23-9,ROSE>25年前  诺斯克利夫夫妻在
<23-9,ROSE>25 years ago, the Northcliffs did groundbreaking research

687
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,570
<23-10,ESPOSITO>儿童的分离焦虑方面有突破性研究
<23-10,ESPOSITO>on separation anxiety in children.

688
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:35,960
<23-11,RYAN>但当时有传言研究中存在不道德行为
<23-11,RYAN>But there were rumors of unethical behavior.

689
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,320
<23-11,RYAN>他们参与到了一些
<23-11,RYAN>And they were involved in some

690
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:39,190
<23-11,RYAN>非常边缘化的行为科学之中
<23-11,RYAN>pretty fringe behavioral science.

691
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:42,550
<23-12,ESPOSITO>诺斯克利夫夫妇是不是用他们的亲生孩子做了测试对象
<23-12,ESPOSITO>Did the Northcliffs use their own children as test subjects?

692
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:44,350
<23-13,ROSE>我什么都不知道
<23-13,ROSE>I wouldn't know anything about that.

693
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,710
<23-14,RYAN>艾玛死了 罗丝
<23-14,RYAN>Emma's dead, Rose.

694
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,690
<23-14,RYAN>如果是她闯进诺斯克利夫夫妇的公寓
<23-14,RYAN>And if she broke into the Northcliffs' apartment

695
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:50,700
<23-14,RYAN>去偷那些录像带
<23-14,RYAN>to steal those tapes,

696
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,230
<23-14,RYAN>那她就是准备揭发他们
<23-14,RYAN>then she was planning to expose them.

697
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:54,200
<23-14,RYAN>那么很有可能是诺斯克利夫夫妇
<23-14,RYAN>It's possible that the Northcliffs

698
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,740
<23-14,RYAN>杀了她封口
<23-14,RYAN>killed her to keep that secret.

699
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:57,930
<23-15,ESPOSITO>如果你不想作为从犯被起诉
<23-15,ESPOSITO>And if you don't want to be charged as an accessory,

700
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:59,870
<23-15,ESPOSITO>你现在最好老实交代
<23-15,ESPOSITO>then you better come clean right now.

701
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,890
<23-16,ROSE>你们得相信我
<23-16,ROSE>You have to believe me.

702
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,530
<23-16,ROSE>我不知道那些实验
<23-16,ROSE>I didn't know the experiments

703
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:08,570
<23-16,ROSE>会伤害那些孩子
<23-16,ROSE>were doing harm to those children.

704
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:12,290
<23-16,ROSE>但是时间说明了一切
<23-16,ROSE>Time has proven otherwise.

705
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:15,660
<23-16,ROSE>布兰登逃离了这个国家  成了一个隐士
<23-16,ROSE>Brandon fled the country, became a recluse.

706
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:19,600
<23-16,ROSE>可怜的费耶  你们知道她的结局
<23-16,ROSE>Poor Fay -- you know what happened to her.

707
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:24,770
<23-17,RYAN>你知道诺斯克利夫夫妇现在可能在哪里吗
<23-17,RYAN>Do you have any idea where the Northcliffs might be right now?

708
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,260
<23-18,ROSE>我从昨天起就没再见过他们
<23-18,ROSE>I haven't seen them since yesterday.

709
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:28,870
<23-18,ROSE>我发誓
<23-18,ROSE>I swear to you.

710
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:31,450
<23-18,ROSE>伙计们
<23-18,ROSE>Guys.

711

716
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:43,330
<24-5,HAYLEY>查到了  哈茨戴尔郊外的一处隐秘住宅
<24-5,HAYLEY>Yes, it's a secluded property outside Hartsdale.

717
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:45,030
<24-6,RYAN>那也许是他们扣留卡塞尔和贝克特的地方
<24-6,RYAN>That could be where they're holding Castle and Beckett.

718
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:46,180
<24-6,RYAN>-我们走吧  -好
<24-6,RYAN>- Let's go. - Yeah.

719
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,880
<25-1,CASTLE>这样行不通
<25-1,CASTLE>This is not gonna happen.

720
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,520
<25-1,CASTLE>我们得再精明点
<25-1,CASTLE>We need to work smarter.

721
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,270
<25-1,CASTLE>怎么办
<25-1,CASTLE>How?

722
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,990
<25-2,JUDAH>这扇门是唯一的出路
<25-2,JUDAH>That door's the only way out.

723
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,340
<25-3,CASTLE>要是我们能找到可以当做杠杆的东西
<25-3,CASTLE>If we could find something we can use as a pry bar,

724
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:02,220
<25-3,CASTLE>我们就能够伸到锁和门框之间
<25-3,CASTLE>we can get it between lock and the frame,

725
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,620
<25-3,CASTLE>这样也许可以把门撬开
<25-3,CASTLE>we might be able to pop it open.

726
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:04,830
<25-4,JUDAH>好的
<25-4,JUDAH>Yeah, okay.

727
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:05,960
<25-4,JUDAH>好吧
<25-4,JUDAH>All right.

728
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:15,080
<26-1,BECKETT>这里面的化学物质都是易爆的
<26-1,BECKETT>So, the chemicals in there are explosive.

729
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:18,940
<26-1,BECKETT>只要一个催化剂就能把它引爆
<26-1,BECKETT>It just needs a catalyst to set it off.

730
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:22,460
<26-1,BECKETT>很好
<26-1,BECKETT>Great.

731
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:25,380
<26-2,BECKETT>导火索
<26-2,BECKETT>Fuse.

732
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:28,690
<26-3,PATTY>给你
<26-3,PATTY>There you go.

733
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,560
<26-4,BECKETT>谢谢  太好了
<26-4,BECKETT>Thanks. Perfect.

734
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,280
<26-5,PATTY>我一直都很喜欢这东西的味道
<26-5,PATTY>I've always loved the smell of this stuff.

735
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:41,940
<26-5,PATTY>好了
<26-5,PATTY>Okay.

736
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,540
<26-6,BECKETT>你俩最好躲起来
<26-6,BECKETT>You two better hide.

737
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,560
<27-1,JUDAH>那是什么
<27-1,JUDAH>What was that?

738
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:05,960
<27-2,CASTLE>不知道  但我们得赶紧离开这
<27-2,CASTLE>I don't know, but we need to get out of here now.

739
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,700
<27-2,CASTLE>好的
<27-2,CASTLE>Okay.

740
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,440
<28-1,BECKETT>跟紧
<28-1,BECKETT>Just stay close.

741
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:18,520
<28-1,BECKETT>这可能是另一个陷阱
<28-1,BECKETT>This could be another trap.

742
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,390
<28-2,BECKETT>退后
<28-2,BECKETT>Get back.

743
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:39,400
<28-3,BECKETT>那里有人  跟紧点  好吗
<28-3,BECKETT>There's someone there. Stay close, okay?

744
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:57,960
<28-4,CASTLE>别开枪
<28-4,CASTLE>Don't shoot.

745
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,350
<28-4,CASTLE>那是用来杀掉开枪者的
<28-4,CASTLE>It's rigged to kill the shooter.

746
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,180
<28-4,CASTLE>西蒙就是那样死的
<28-4,CASTLE>That's how Simon died.

747
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,580
<28-6,CASTLE>谢天谢地你没事
<28-6,CASTLE>Thank God you're okay.

748
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:09,380
<28-7,JUDAH>帕特里夏
<28-7,JUDAH>Patricia.

749
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:10,730
<28-8,BECKETT>你还好吗
<28-8,BECKETT>You okay?

750
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:11,580
<28-9,CASTLE>是的  没事
<28-9,CASTLE>Yeah. Good.

751
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:12,830
<28-10,TODD>我们得继续走
<28-10,TODD>We should keep moving.

752
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:13,980
<28-11,CASTLE>他说得对
<28-11,CASTLE>He's right.

753
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,250
<28-12,CASTLE>这有可能是个陷阱
<28-12,CASTLE>It could be a trap!

754
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,210
<28-13,BECKETT>不  等等
<28-13,BECKETT>No, wait, wait.

755
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:24,110
<28-13,BECKETT>没事
<28-13,BECKETT>It's fine!

756
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:25,150
<28-14,TODD>我们可以出去了
<28-14,TODD>W-We can get out.

757
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,290
<28-15,PATTY>我们走  赶紧离开这
<28-15,PATTY>Let's go. Let's get out of here.

758
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:28,260
<28-16,JUDAH>总算可以走了
<28-16,JUDAH>About damn time.

759
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:29,960
<28-17,TODD>我们自由了
<28-17,TODD>Oh, we're free!

760
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:31,500
<28-17,TODD>不
<28-17,TODD>No!

761
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:36,390
<28-18,PATTY>-不  -我们被困在里面了
<28-18,PATTY>- No! - We're locked in.

762
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:47,970
<28-19,CASTLE>不管他们出于什么目的
<28-19,CASTLE>Whatever they're for,

763
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:50,070
<28-19,CASTLE>我们只有不到五分钟的时间来想明白了
<28-19,CASTLE>we got less than five minutes to figure it out.

764
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:52,750
<28-19,CASTLE>门一锁死  倒计时就开始了
<28-19,CASTLE>It started counting down as soon as the doors closed.

765
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,740
<28-20,BECKETT>明显这房间是抓我们的人设计的终局
<28-20,BECKETT>Okay, clearly this room is our captor's endgame.

766
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,570
<28-20,BECKETT>他想让我们最后困在这里
<28-20,BECKETT>He wanted us to end up here.

767
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:00,000
<28-21,PATTY>为什么  他想从我们身上得到什么
<28-21,PATTY>Why? What does he want from us?

768
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:02,700
<28-22,CASTLE>是另一条线索吗
<28-22,CASTLE>Another clue?

769
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:04,910
<28-23,BECKETT>谜题的最后一部分
<28-23,BECKETT>Last piece of the puzzle --

770
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:05,880
<28-23,BECKETT>剩下的人
<28-23,BECKETT>"Of those who remain,

771
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:08,040
<28-23,BECKETT>只有你们的另一半可以活着
<28-23,BECKETT>only your better half can survive."

772
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,370
<28-24,JUDAH>这到底是什么意思
<28-24,JUDAH>What the hell does that mean?

773
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,180
<28-25,BECKETT>这里有六个人  三个控制杆
<28-25,BECKETT>There are six of us left and three levers.

774
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:14,060
<28-25,BECKETT>他想把爱人分开
<28-25,BECKETT>He wants to separate the couples,

775
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:16,380
<28-25,BECKETT>让我们来选择谁可以获得自由
<28-25,BECKETT>make us choose who goes free.

776
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:18,550
<28-26,PATTY>留下的人要拉动控制杆
<28-26,PATTY>And who stays behind to pull the levers.

777
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:20,600
<28-26,PATTY>我猜三个杆子必须同时拉动
<28-26,PATTY>I assume all three need to be pulled at once

778
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,540
<28-26,PATTY>才能把门打开
<28-26,PATTY>to open the door.

779
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:22,960
<28-27,CASTLE>除非他就想让我们这么去想
<28-27,CASTLE>Unless that's what he wants us to think.

780
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:25,270
<28-27,CASTLE>这三个控制杆也可能把房间炸毁
<28-27,CASTLE>These levers could just as easily blow this room.

781
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:26,300
<28-28,JUDAH>我们怎么知道呢
<28-28,JUDAH>How are we supposed to know?

782
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,360
<28-29,TODD>我们必须要有信念
<28-29,TODD>We have to have faith.

783
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:36,590
<28-30,JUDAH>等等
<28-30,JUDAH>W-Wait, wait!

784
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,740
<28-31,TODD>看到了吗  信念
<28-31,TODD>See? Faith.

785
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:46,460
<28-31,TODD>现在  谁愿意和我留在这
<28-31,TODD>Now, who's staying in here with me?

786
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:50,410
<29-1,SWAT MEMBER>州警察
<29-1,SWAT MEMBER>State police!

787
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:55,430
<29-2,SWAT MEMBER>我们找到了两名人质
<29-2,SWAT MEMBER>We got two hostages!

788
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:56,800
<29-3,ESPOSITO>是诺斯克利夫夫妇
<29-3,ESPOSITO>It's the Northcliffs.

789
00:34:56,810 --> 00:34:58,880
<29-3,ESPOSITO>-卧室安全  -厨房安全
<29-3,ESPOSITO>-Bedroom's clear! -Kitchen's clear!

790
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:01,000
<29-4,ESPOSITO>这是什么
<29-4,ESPOSITO>What the hell is this?

791
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:04,900
<29-4,ESPOSITO>爸爸
<29-4,ESPOSITO>Dad?

792
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:08,660
<29-5,ALEXIS>他们在哪里
<29-5,ALEXIS>Where are they?

793
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:13,290
<29-6,JEFFREY NORTHCLIFF>山脚下的树林里有一个隐蔽的房子
<29-6,JEFFREY NORTHCLIFF>There's a building hidden in the trees at the bottom of the hill.

794
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:14,880
<29-7,ESPOSITO>是谁做的  谁把你们留在这里
<29-7,ESPOSITO>Who's behind this? Who left you here?

795
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:17,190
<29-8,SAMANTHA NORTHCLIFF>我们的儿子布兰登
<29-8,SAMANTHA NORTHCLIFF>Our son, Brandon.

796
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:18,410
<30-1,TODD>我们快没时间了
<30-1,TODD>We're out of time.

797
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:19,930
<30-1,TODD>你们必须做出选择
<30-1,TODD>You need to choose which ones of you

798
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:21,280
<30-1,TODD>谁要和我一起留在这里
<30-1,TODD>are staying in here with me.

799
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,080
<30-2,CASTLE>我留下
<30-2,CASTLE>I'll stay.

800
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:31,950
<30-3,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<30-3,BECKETT>Castle.

801
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:37,590
<30-3,BECKETT>好吧
<30-3,BECKETT>Fine.

802
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,760
<30-4,BECKETT>我不会把你单独留在这的
<30-4,BECKETT>But I'm not letting you stay here alone.

803
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:46,170
<30-4,BECKETT>帕特里夏你带着其他人走
<30-4,BECKETT>Patricia, you leave with the others.

804
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:47,840
<30-5,TODD>指示上说了"你们的另一半"
<30-5,TODD>The instructions say "Your better half."

805
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:49,220
<30-5,TODD>如果你俩都留下  这就破坏了规则
<30-5,TODD>If you both stay, that's breaking the rules.

806
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,100
<30-6,BECKETT>去他的规则
<30-6,BECKETT>Screw the rules!

807
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,460
<30-7,TODD>这样对所有人都会造成不好的后果
<30-7,TODD>There could be consequences for all of us!

808
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:53,840
<30-8,JUDAH>我们服从规则也会有后果
<30-8,JUDAH>There's consequences when we follow the rules, too.

809
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:56,060
<30-8,JUDAH>没事
<30-8,JUDAH>Come on.

810
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:02,130
<30-9,PATTY>谢谢你
<30-9,PATTY>Thank you!

811
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:03,320
<30-9,PATTY>我们会去求救的
<30-9,PATTY>We'll send help.

812
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,210
<30-10,CASTLE>现在怎么办
<30-10,CASTLE>So, what now?

813
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:25,890
<30-10,CASTLE>对不起
<30-10,CASTLE>I'm sorry.

814
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:27,490
<31-1,TODD>我以为我们可以跑出去
<31-1,TODD>I thought we could run out the door.

815
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,420
<31-1,TODD>真的吗
<31-1,TODD>Really?

816
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,970
<31-2,CASTLE>不是因为我们打破了你的规则吗
<31-2,CASTLE>So it's not because we broke your rules?

817
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:34,630
<31-3,BECKETT>他确实说了会有后果
<31-3,BECKETT>Well, he did say that there would be consequences.

818
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:38,720
<31-4,CASTLE>我们知道是你搞的鬼
<31-4,CASTLE>We know it's you.

819
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:42,420
<31-5,TODD>该死
<31-5,TODD>Damn it.

820
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:46,090
<31-5,TODD>别动
<31-5,TODD>Don't!

821
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:51,030
<31-6,TODD>我哪里露馅了
<31-6,TODD>What gave me away?

822
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,250
<31-7,CASTLE>即便我们认为这房间是险境
<31-7,CASTLE>When you ran into this room,

823
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:56,410
<31-7,CASTLE>你还是跑进来了
<31-7,CASTLE>even though we all suspected it would be booby-trapped.

824
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:58,930
<31-8,BECKETT>还有当你拉动控制杆时
<31-8,BECKETT>And then when you pulled that lever,

825
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:00,260
<31-8,BECKETT>你一点都没犹豫
<31-8,BECKETT>you didn't even hesitate.

826
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,180
<31-9,CASTLE>就跟西蒙扣动扳机时
<31-9,CASTLE>Same way you didn't hesitate

827
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:03,940
<31-9,CASTLE>你没有犹豫一样
<31-9,CASTLE>when Simon pulled the trigger.

828
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,320
<31-9,CASTLE>你不害怕
<31-9,CASTLE>You weren't afraid,

829
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:08,280
<31-9,CASTLE>不是因为你是有信仰的牧师
<31-9,CASTLE>and not because you're a "minister" With faith,

830
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,360
<31-9,CASTLE>而是因为你是幕后黑手
<31-9,CASTLE>but because you are a mastermind with the knowledge

831
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,310
<31-9,CASTLE>知道枪被改造  会从后射出
<31-9,CASTLE>that the gun was rigged to fire backwards.

832
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,690
<31-10,TODD>这把不会
<31-10,TODD>Not like this one.

833
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,040
<31-11,TODD>把实验完成吧
<31-11,TODD>Let's finish the experiment.

834
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:24,040
<31-11,TODD>你们其中一个得死掉
<31-11,TODD>One of you has to die.

835
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,010
<31-11,TODD>这就是规则
<31-11,TODD>Those are the rules.

836
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:26,070
<31-12,BECKETT>你为什么这么做
<31-12,BECKETT>Why are you doing this?

837
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:27,570
<31-13,TODD>当我父母把我和双胞胎姐姐分开
<31-13,TODD>That's the same question I asked my parents

838
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:29,710
<31-13,TODD>没日没夜测试我们时
<31-13,TODD>when they would rip me away from my twin sister --

839
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:32,860
<31-13,TODD>我问了同样的问题
<31-13,TODD>testing us over and over, day after day.

840
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:35,430
<31-14,CASTLE>听着  任何人都不该
<31-14,CASTLE>Look, no one should be treated

841
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:36,700
<31-14,CASTLE>遭受你和姐姐的待遇
<31-14,CASTLE>the way you and your sister were.

842
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:37,490
<31-15,BECKETT>让我们帮你
<31-15,BECKETT>Let us help you.

843
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,650
<31-16,TODD>帮你  就凭你
<31-16,TODD>Help me? You?

844
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,050
<31-16,TODD>为什么
<31-16,TODD>Why?

845
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,690
<31-16,TODD>因为你是警察
<31-16,TODD>'Cause you're a cop?

846
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,030
<31-16,TODD>我还是孩子的时候  跟警察谈过
<31-16,TODD>I talked to cop once, when I was a kid.

847
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:46,680
<31-16,TODD>你知道发生了什么吗
<31-16,TODD>You know what happened?

848
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,820
<31-16,TODD>他派了两个12分局的警员去
<31-16,TODD>He sent over two officers from the 12th Precinct,

849
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:49,900
<31-16,TODD>你的分局
<31-16,TODD>your precinct.

850
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:51,430
<31-16,TODD>他们跟我父母
<31-16,TODD>They talked to my parents

851
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:53,730
<31-17,BECKETT>谈了五分钟  就走掉了
<31-17,BECKETT>for five minutes, then walked away!

852
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:55,300
<31-17,BECKETT>很抱歉
<31-17,BECKETT>I'm sorry.

853
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,920
<31-18,TODD>抱歉有什么用  我姐姐遭罪了
<31-18,TODD>Not as sorry as my sister was.

854
00:37:57,020 --> 00:38:00,630
<31-18,TODD>我父母命令我们接受更多分离  测试
<31-18,TODD>My parents ordered more isolation, more tests.

855
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:04,020
<31-19,CASTLE>你认为贝克特应该为此负责
<31-19,CASTLE>So you're holding Beckett responsible?

856
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:07,810
<31-19,CASTLE>她那时还是个孩子
<31-19,CASTLE>She was a child when that happened.

857
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:09,360
<31-19,CASTLE>你为什么要惩罚她
<31-19,CASTLE>Why are you punishing her?

858
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:12,150
<31-20,TODD>这不是惩罚  这是科学
<31-20,TODD>This isn't punishment. This is science.

859
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:14,280
<31-21,BECKETT>帕特里夏是教育委员会的心理医生
<31-21,BECKETT>Patricia is a psychiatrist on the Board of Education.

860
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,290
<31-21,BECKETT>那里也有人让你和姐姐失望了
<31-21,BECKETT>Did someone there let you and your sister down?

861
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:19,720
<31-22,TODD>凯特  所有人都让我们大失所望
<31-22,TODD>Kate, everyone let us down.

862
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:20,810
<31-23,BECKETT>这么说  我们是
<31-23,BECKETT>So we're all surrogates

863
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:23,150
<31-23,BECKETT>那些没能保护你们的人的代替品
<31-23,BECKETT>for people that weren't able to protect you two.

864
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:25,780
<31-24,CASTLE>但你很小心地选择了彼此相爱的人
<31-24,CASTLE>But you were careful to choose people who love each other,

865
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:28,330
<31-24,CASTLE>因为你爱你的姐姐
<31-24,CASTLE>because you loved your sister.

866
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,650
<31-24,CASTLE>她是你的灵魂伴侣
<31-24,CASTLE>She was your soulmate.

867
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:33,360
<31-25,TODD>现在你们其中一个也能感同身受了
<31-25,TODD>Now one of you has to feel what I feel.

868
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,580
<31-26,BECKETT>为什么选择艾玛
<31-26,BECKETT>Now, why did you choose Emma?

869
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:36,310
<31-27,TODD>她想曝光我的父母
<31-27,TODD>She wanted to expose my parents!

870
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:37,330
<31-27,TODD>那不够
<31-27,TODD>That's not enough --

871
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,060
<31-27,TODD>两个孩子解谜的视频
<31-27,TODD>some video tapes of some kids doing puzzles?

872
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:42,470
<31-27,TODD>算不上什么  新闻上播播就再无音讯
<31-27,TODD>That's nothing, a blip in the news cycle.

873
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:44,590
<31-27,TODD>但你们其中一人生还
<31-27,TODD>But one of you goes free,

874
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:49,010
<31-27,TODD>告诉外界我杀掉了你的挚爱并自杀
<31-27,TODD>and tells how I killed your one true love and myself --

875
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:52,910
<31-27,TODD>只有那时  世界才会明白我父母制造了
<31-27,TODD>only then will the world truly understand the monster

876
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:54,210
<31-27,TODD>怎样的怪兽
<31-27,TODD>my parents created.

877
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,040
<31-27,TODD>别多说了
<31-27,TODD>No more talking.

878
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:58,310
<31-27,TODD>该解决最后的谜题了
<31-27,TODD>Time to solve the final puzzle.

879
00:38:58,610 --> 00:38:59,720
<31-25,TODD>哪个死
<31-25,TODD>Which one of you dies?

880
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,070
<31-28,BECKETT>我不会选择
<31-28,BECKETT>I won't choose.

881
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:03,910
<31-29,CASTLE>我也不会
<31-29,CASTLE>Neither will I.

882
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:07,080
<31-30,TODD>赶紧决定  否则我就打残你们  直到死掉
<31-30,TODD>Decide or I'll start maiming you till someone does.

883
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,240
<31-27,TODD>好吧
<31-27,TODD>Okay, okay.

884
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,270
<31-28,BECKETT>我选
<31-28,BECKETT>I'll choose.

885
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:13,360
<31-31,CASTLE>我选
<31-31,CASTLE>I-I'll decide.

886
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:15,790
<31-31,CASTLE>很好
<31-31,CASTLE>Good.

887
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:18,120
<31-32,TODD>谁死  里克
<31-32,TODD>Who dies, Rick?

888
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:21,510
<31-33,CASTLE>谁都不死
<31-33,CASTLE>No one dies.

889
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:27,220
<31-34,BECKETT>别动
<31-34,BECKETT>Don't move.

890
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:35,060
<31-35,ESPOSITO>你们还好吗
<31-35,ESPOSITO>You guys okay?

891
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,860
<31-36,BECKETT>没事  感谢来营救我们
<31-36,BECKETT>Yeah. Thanks for rescuing us.

892
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:39,010
<31-37,HAYLEY>是啊  很显然没了我们你们很无助
<31-37,HAYLEY>Yes, because clearly you're helpless without us.

893
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:40,290
<31-38,CASTLE>你们怎么找到我们的
<31-38,CASTLE>How'd you guys even find us?

894
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:42,410
<31-39,RYAN>我们有最棒的帮手
<31-39,RYAN>Well, we had our best person on it.

895
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:46,780
<31-40,ALEXIS>真是不能让你独处五分钟
<31-40,ALEXIS>I can't leave you alone for five minutes.

896
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:48,500
<31-41,CASTLE>难道说不拥抱我了吗
<31-41,CASTLE>Does this mean no hug?

897
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:01,310
<32-1,HAYLEY>我出去嗨
<32-1,HAYLEY>I'm heading out for a bit of fun.

<32-1,HAYLEY>一起吗
<32-1,HAYLEY>Want to come with?

899
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,520
<32-2,ALEXIS>不了  多谢邀请
<32-2,ALEXIS>I'll pass. Thanks.

900
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,670
<32-3,HAYLEY>你怎么样
<32-3,HAYLEY>How you doing?

901
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:18,930
<32-4,HAYLEY>你很担心你的父亲
<32-4,HAYLEY>You worry a lot about your Father.

902
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:25,160
<32-5,ALEXIS>如果理查德·卡塞尔是你爸  你也会的
<32-5,ALEXIS>You would, too, if Richard Castle was your dad.

903
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:29,070
<32-5,ALEXIS>他一年也就被绑架两次
<32-5,ALEXIS>I mean, the guy's abducted, like, what, twice a year?

904
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:31,700
<32-5,ALEXIS>有点超标
<32-5,ALEXIS>I think that's a tad above the national average.

905
00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:33,190
<32-6,HAYLEY>但他总是回家
<32-6,HAYLEY>Yet he always comes home.

906
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:34,530
<32-6,HAYLEY>你知道为什么吗
<32-6,HAYLEY>Do you know why that is?

907
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:35,450
<32-6,HAYLEY>知道
<32-6,HAYLEY>Yeah.

908
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:37,010
<32-7,ALEXIS>他很幸运
<32-7,ALEXIS>He's really lucky.

909
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:40,370
<32-8,HAYLEY>不  他很擅长他所做的
<32-8,HAYLEY>No. He's really good at what he does.

910
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,420
<32-9,ALEXIS>他有你这么棒吗
<32-9,ALEXIS>Is he as good as you?

911
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:48,940
<32-10,HAYLEY>当然没有
<32-10,HAYLEY>Good heavens, no.

912
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:50,420
<32-10,HAYLEY>你为什么会这么问
<32-10,HAYLEY>Why would you ask such a thing?

913
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:52,430
<32-10,HAYLEY>好了  给你打扮打扮
<32-10,HAYLEY>All right. We're gonna get you dolled up,

914
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,610
<32-10,HAYLEY>我们去夜店
<32-10,HAYLEY>we are gonna go out to some clubs,

915
00:40:54,610 --> 00:40:57,020
<32-10,HAYLEY>闯点小祸
<32-10,HAYLEY>we're gonna get into just a tiny, little bit of trouble.

916
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:58,360
<32-10,HAYLEY>无伤大雅  走吧
<32-10,HAYLEY>Never hurt anyone. Come on.

917
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,580
<33-1,BECKETT>谢了
<33-1,BECKETT>Thanks.

918
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:08,660
<33-2,CASTLE>还好吗
<33-2,CASTLE>You okay?

919
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:11,080
<33-3,BECKETT>我在想那些小孩
<33-3,BECKETT>Yeah, I was just thinking about those little kids.

920
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:11,960
<33-3,BECKETT>我是说
<33-3,BECKETT>I mean...

921
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,700
<33-3,BECKETT>很多人让他们失望了
<33-3,BECKETT>a lot of people let them down.

922
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:19,410
<33-4,CASTLE>尽管最终他们的父母被曝光
<33-4,CASTLE>And although their parents are finally being exposed,

923
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:21,290
<33-4,CASTLE>远不及弥补一切
<33-4,CASTLE>it's far too little, too late.

924
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:23,760
<33-5,BECKETT>今早醒来  我绝没想到
<33-5,BECKETT>This is not the day that I was expecting

925
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,120
<33-5,BECKETT>这一天如此度过
<33-5,BECKETT>when I woke up this morning.

926
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,150
<33-6,CASTLE>可不是
<33-6,CASTLE>Tell me about it.

927
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:28,140
<33-6,CASTLE>至少结果还不赖
<33-6,CASTLE>But at least it's ending well.

928
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,030
<33-7,BECKETT>是啊
<33-7,BECKETT>Yeah.

929
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:34,070
<33-8,BECKETT>怎么了
<33-8,BECKETT>What's wrong?

930
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:34,950
<33-8,BECKETT>没事
<33-8,BECKETT>Nothing.

931
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,900
<33-9,CASTLE>我只是很期待
<33-9,CASTLE>I-I ju-- I was really looking forward

932
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:39,000
<33-9,CASTLE>能够与...
<33-9,CASTLE>to the prospect of collaborating

933
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,250
<33-9,CASTLE>史蒂芬·金合作
<33-9,CASTLE>with Stephen King, you know?

934
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:43,770
<33-10,BECKETT>卡塞尔  想想好的一面
<33-10,BECKETT>Well, you know, Castle, look on the bright side.

935
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,820
<33-10,BECKETT>史蒂芬·金打来电话时
<33-10,BECKETT>When Stephen King does call,

936
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:47,780
<33-10,BECKETT>至少现在你有个打破尴尬的超赞段子了
<33-10,BECKETT>at least you'll have one hell of an icebreaker.
