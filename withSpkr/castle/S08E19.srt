<2-2,CASTLE>Watching you sleep.

29
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:19,220
<2-2,CASTLE>恐不恐怖
<2-2,CASTLE>Is that creepy?

30
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,160
<2-3,BECKETT>我觉得很温馨
<2-3,BECKETT>I think it's sweet.

31
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,050
<2-4,CASTLE>我还照了相
<2-4,CASTLE>I took some pictures.

32
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:24,490
<2-5,BECKETT>不那么温馨了
<2-5,BECKETT>Less sweet.

33
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,650
<2-6,CASTLE>是一系列的  你一般不会醒来的
<2-6,CASTLE>They're part of a series. Usually you don't wake up.

34
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:28,050
<2-7,BECKETT>这下恐怖了
<2-7,BECKETT>And now it's creepy.

35
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,070
<2-8,CASTLE>我在想
<2-8,CASTLE>I've been thinking...

36
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:30,910
<2-9,BECKETT>不
<2-9,BECKETT>Oh, no.

37
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:33,660
<2-10,CASTLE>放心  我已经放弃零重力做爱的事了
<2-10,CASTLE>Oh, relax. I'm over that whole sex-in-zero-g thing.

38
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:36,210
<2-11,BECKETT>很好  那是绝对要出意外的
<2-11,BECKETT>Good, 'cause that was just an accident waiting to happen.

39
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:37,080
<2-12,CASTLE>但说真的
<2-12,CASTLE>Seriously, though.

40
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,980
<2-12,CASTLE>我觉得我们该改变一下了
<2-12,CASTLE>I think it's time we shake things up.

41
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:40,820
<2-12,CASTLE>搬去巴黎
<2-12,CASTLE>Move to Paris, you know,

42
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,620
<2-12,CASTLE>去尼泊尔寻找埋藏宝藏
<2-12,CASTLE>search for buried treasure in Nepal.

43
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:45,610
<2-12,CASTLE>我们可以乘热气球穿过撒哈拉
<2-12,CASTLE>We could fly a hot air balloon across the Sahara.

44
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:48,030
<2-13,BECKETT>知道吗  我喜欢那些点子
<2-13,BECKETT>You know what? I love all of those ideas,

45
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,690
<2-13,BECKETT>但我才刚当上警监
<2-13,BECKETT>but I just became captain,

46
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:51,790
<2-13,BECKETT>你还要经营你的私家侦探生意
<2-13,BECKETT>and you have your P.I. business.

47
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,060
<2-14,CASTLE>还要洛克塞特
<2-14,CASTLE>And then there's LokSat.

48
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:53,920
<2-15,BECKETT>是啊
<2-15,BECKETT>Exactly.

49
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,760
<2-16,BECKETT>我们有责任  是吧
<2-16,BECKETT>We have responsibilities, right?

50
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:59,800
<2-17,CASTLE>如果我们没有呢
<2-17,CASTLE>But what if we didn't?

51
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,790
<2-17,CASTLE>请稍后
<2-17,CASTLE>Hold, please.

52
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:03,720
<2-18,BECKETT>我可能得接  或许是有命案呢
<2-18,BECKETT>Um, I might need that. That might be a homicide.

53
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,490
<2-19,CASTLE>被害人不会死得更透了
<2-19,CASTLE>The victim's not gonna get any deader.

54
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:06,480
<2-19,CASTLE>听我说
<2-19,CASTLE>Listen.

55
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,610
<2-19,CASTLE>如果我们找到了洛克塞特  拿下了他
<2-19,CASTLE>Let's say we find LokSat and take him down --

56
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:11,040
<2-19,CASTLE>而且不被反杀
<2-19,CASTLE>without getting killed.

57
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:12,630
<2-21,CASTLE>然后呢
<2-21,CASTLE>What then?

58
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,440
<2-21,CASTLE>你不会当很久的12分局警监
<2-21,CASTLE>You're not gonna be captain of the 12th Precinct for very long.

59
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,700
<2-21,CASTLE>你平步青云  不可阻挡
<2-21,CASTLE>You're on a rocket. Sky's the limit.

60
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,780
<2-21,CASTLE>你知道到时会怎么样吗
<2-21,CASTLE>So you know what happens then?

61
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:23,780
<2-23,CASTLE>我们成为普通人
<2-23,CASTLE>We become normal.

62
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:27,400
<2-24,BECKETT>不  卡塞尔  你永远不会成为普通人
<2-24,BECKETT>No, Castle, you're never gonna be normal.

63
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,530
<2-24,BECKETT>我是认真的
<2-24,BECKETT>I'm serious.

64
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:31,350
<2-25,CASTLE>-想想吧  -我会的
<2-25,CASTLE>- Think about it. - I will.

65
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:34,660
<2-26,BECKETT>什么情况
<2-26,BECKETT>What do you got?

66
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:35,570
<2-26,BECKETT>阿兰·马斯特斯
<2-26,BECKETT>Alan Masters.

67
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:37,300
<3-1,LANIE PARISH>一切迹象表明是中毒
<3-1,LANIE PARISH>All signs point to poison --

68
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:41,040
<3-1,LANIE PARISH>瞳孔放大  唇色发青
<3-1,LANIE PARISH>dilated pupils, bluish discoloration around the lips.

69
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,960
<3-1,LANIE PARISH>这是明显征兆
<3-1,LANIE PARISH>That's a giveaway,

70
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,910
<3-1,LANIE PARISH>但得等尸检完毕才能确定
<3-1,LANIE PARISH>but I'll know for sure after the autopsy.

71
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:44,470
<3-2,CASTLE>谁报的警
<3-2,CASTLE>Who called it in?

72
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,820
<3-3,LANIE>他有线电视公司的客服接线员
<3-3,LANIE>Customer-service operator for his cable company.

73
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,830
<3-3,LANIE>事发时她正在跟他打电话
<3-3,LANIE>She was on the phone with him when it happened.

74
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:50,040
<3-4,CASTLE>好个死法
<3-4,CASTLE>What a way to go.

75
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,190
<3-5,LANIE>毒死还是跟有线电视公司打电话
<3-5,LANIE>Poisoned or on the phone with the cable company?

76
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,810
<3-6,CASTLE>至少毒发很快
<3-6,CASTLE>Well, at least the poison was quick.

77
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,060
<3-7,JAVIER ESPOSITO>看来凶手把窗户撬开了
<3-7,JAVIER ESPOSITO>Looks like our killer jimmied that window open.

78
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,850
<3-7,JAVIER ESPOSITO>邻居认为昨晚8点左右听到了
<3-7,JAVIER ESPOSITO>Neighbor thought she heard somebody on the fire escape

79
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,220
<3-7,JAVIER ESPOSITO>有人走防火梯
<3-7,JAVIER ESPOSITO>last night around 8:00.

80
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,610
<3-8,CASTLE>他怎么中毒的
<3-8,CASTLE>How was he poisoned?

81
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:01,450
<3-9,LANIE>饮水
<3-9,LANIE>In his water.

82
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:03,210
<3-9,LANIE>厨房水槽下面的滤水器
<3-9,LANIE>The filter underneath the kitchen sink

83
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:04,370
<3-9,LANIE>被动了手脚
<3-9,LANIE>was tampered with.

84
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:07,250
<3-10,ESPOSITO>讽刺的是  他是城市安全检查员
<3-10,ESPOSITO>Ironically, he works for the city as a safety inspector.

85
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:12,190
<3-11,CASTLE>如果我是个人物性格专家  而我就是
<3-11,CASTLE>You know, if I were an expert on character, which I am,

86
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:15,240
<3-11,CASTLE>我会说阿兰算是个梦想家
<3-11,CASTLE>I would say that Alan was a bit of a dreamer,

87
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,590
<3-11,CASTLE>白天在街头进行调查
<3-11,CASTLE>spending his days on the ground inspecting things

88
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:20,000
<3-11,CASTLE>但晚上  却做起梦来
<3-11,CASTLE>but his nights in the clouds,

89
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,670
<3-11,CASTLE>幻想着冒险
<3-11,CASTLE>fantasizing of adventure.

90
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:23,810
<3-12,CASTLE>不幸的是  他还没真正体验生活
<3-12,CASTLE>Tragically, his life was cut short

91
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,650
<3-12,CASTLE>就早逝了
<3-12,CASTLE>before he ever truly lived.

92
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:28,610
<3-12,CASTLE>怎么回事
<3-12,CASTLE>What's going on?

93
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,650
<3-13,ALAN>或许没有
<3-13,ALAN>Or not.

94
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,330
<3-13,ALAN>你们都在我公寓里做什么
<3-13,ALAN>What are you all doing in my apartment?

95
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:36,140
<3-14,ESPOSITO>蕾妮
<3-14,ESPOSITO>Um, Lanie.

96
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,930
<3-15,LANIE>别看我  他刚刚明明死了
<3-15,LANIE>Don't "Um, Lanie" me. That man was dead!

97
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:41,760
<3-15,LANIE>他现在可活得好好的
<3-15,LANIE>Well, he's very much alive now.

98
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,260
<4-1,LANIE>他当时没有脉搏  没有呼吸声
<4-1,LANIE>He had no pulse, no breath sounds,

99
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,150
<4-1,LANIE>而且瞳孔放大固定
<4-1,LANIE>and his pupils were dilated and fixed.

100
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:48,030
<4-1,LANIE>那尸僵  尸斑呢
<4-1,LANIE>Was there rigor mortis, lividity?

101
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:50,410
<4-2,LANIE>没有  但他当时死了还不到一小时
<4-2,LANIE>No, but he'd been dead less than an hour.

102
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:52,180
<4-3,BECKETT>蕾妮  被害人真的...
<4-3,BECKETT>Lanie, hey. Is it true that our victim was --

103
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:54,680
<4-4,LANIE>他都死了  我会做工作的
<4-4,LANIE>He was dead, okay? I know how to do my job.

104
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:56,620
<4-5,BECKETT>好嘛  冷静  没事的  我就...
<4-5,BECKETT>Okay, calm down. It's all good. I just --

105
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,730
<4-6,LANIE>不不  不是没事
<4-6,LANIE>No, no, no. It's not all good.

106
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:01,210
<4-6,LANIE>我差点往他肝脏里插了根温度计
<4-6,LANIE>I almost stuck a thermometer in his liver.

107
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:03,050
<4-7,BECKETT>他情况稳定了吗
<4-7,BECKETT>Uh, so is he stable?

108
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:04,370
<4-7,BECKETT>我还在做测试
<4-7,BECKETT>Well, I'm still running tests,

109
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:06,260
<4-8,BECKETT>但他似乎非常健康
<4-8,BECKETT>but he seems completely healthy

110
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:09,730
<4-8,BECKETT>尽管他摄入了足以致死的河豚毒素
<4-8,BECKETT>despite having ingested a deadly dose of tetrodotoxin.

111
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:10,780
<4-9,LANIE>河豚毒素
<4-9,LANIE>TTX.

112
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:13,320
<4-9,LANIE>是一种很多鱼类含有的毒素
<4-9,LANIE>It's a neurotoxin found in several species of fish.

113
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:14,860
<4-9,LANIE>效力很强
<4-9,LANIE>It's extremely potent.

114
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,840
<4-10,BECKETT>但他还是活了下来  有什么解释吗
<4-10,BECKETT>And yet he survived, so do you have an explanation.

115
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:21,060
<4-10,BECKETT>不  但你丈夫有
<4-10,BECKETT>No, but your husband sure does.

116
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,060
<5-1,CASTLE>你就是当代拉撒路
<5-1,CASTLE>You are a modern-day Lazarus,

117
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,820
<5-1,CASTLE>你起死回生  好回答那个永恒的问题
<5-1,CASTLE>risen from the grave to answer the eternal question --

118
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,910
<5-1,CASTLE>另一边什么样
<5-1,CASTLE>What's on the other side?

119
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,250
<5-2,ALAN>对不起  你是谁来着
<5-2,ALAN>I'm sorry. Who are you again?

120
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,040
<5-3,BECKETT>请原谅他  马斯特斯先生
<5-3,BECKETT>You'll have to forgive him, Mr. Masters.

121
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,270
<5-3,BECKETT>他很容易激动
<5-3,BECKETT>He's very excitable.

122
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:35,440
<5-4,CASTLE>抱歉  我觉得揭秘
<5-4,CASTLE>Well, excuse me if I find pulling back the curtain

123
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,650
<5-4,CASTLE>我们死后会发生什么实在有点令人激动
<5-4,CASTLE>on what happens when we die just a tad exciting.

124
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:40,600
<5-4,CASTLE>是有白光吗  还是类似隧道那种
<5-4,CASTLE>Was there a white light or is it more of a tunnel thing?

125
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,940
<5-5,ALAN>我记得的最后一件事
<5-5,ALAN>The last thing I remember,

126
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:44,990
<5-5,ALAN>是服药  想把有线电视修好
<5-5,ALAN>I was taking my pills, trying to get my cable fixed,

127
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:47,740
<5-5,ALAN>然后我就醒来了  公寓里全是警察
<5-5,ALAN>and then I woke up - to an apartment full of police.

128
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:50,370
<5-6,CASTLE>没有灵魂出窍体验吗
<5-6,CASTLE>So, no out-of-body experience?

129
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,670
<5-7,BECKETT>你有什么仇家吗
<5-7,BECKETT>Do you have any enemies?

130
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:53,810
<5-8,ALAN>我  没有  我就是个普通人
<5-8,ALAN>Me? No. I'm an average guy.

131
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:55,110
<5-8,ALAN>我上班  我回家
<5-8,ALAN>I go to work, I come home.

132
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:57,740
<5-9,CASTLE>但你有更广大的梦想  是吧
<5-9,CASTLE>But you dream of so much more, don't you?

133
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,680
<5-10,ALAN>你怎么知道的
<5-10,ALAN>How do you know that?

134
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,940
<5-10,ALAN>你读了我的日记吗
<5-10,ALAN>Did you read my diary?

135
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,460
<5-11,CASTLE>没有  我看到了你的照片...
<5-11,CASTLE>No, I saw your pictures on your --

136
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,020
<5-11,CASTLE>你还记日记吗
<5-11,CASTLE>Wait, you keep a diary?

137
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,600
<5-11,CASTLE>作为大老爷们  管那叫日志比较好
<5-11,CASTLE>As a grown man, call it a journal.

138
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,850
<5-12,BECKETT>工作上呢
<5-12,BECKETT>What about work?

139
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,770
<5-12,BECKETT>你最近有惹怒什么公司同事吗
<5-12,BECKETT>Have you upset anyone there recently?

140
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:11,810
<5-12,BECKETT>有
<5-12,BECKETT>Yeah.

141
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,580
<5-13,ALAN>有个我手下的人
<5-13,ALAN>There is this guy that works for me --

142
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:16,310
<5-13,ALAN>之前是我的手下  戴夫·巴顿
<5-13,ALAN>well, used to work for me -- Dave Barton.

143
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,380
<5-13,ALAN>我不得不解雇了他  因为他
<5-13,ALAN>I had to fire him because he was letting

144
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:21,210
<5-13,ALAN>对严重的违规只给予了警告处理
<5-13,ALAN>serious infractions slide with just a warning.

145
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:22,130
<5-14,BECKETT>是因为受贿吗
<5-14,BECKETT>Was it for money?

146
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:23,730
<5-15,ALAN>据传是如此
<5-15,ALAN>That was the rumor.

147
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:27,030
<5-15,ALAN>他解雇他时  他的确显得有些生气
<5-15,ALAN>And he did seem a little miffed when I let him go.

148
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:29,420
<5-15,ALAN>我把他留给我的语音信息放给你们听
<5-15,ALAN>I'll play you the message that he left me.

149
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:32,330
<5-16,DAVE BARTON>你个臭蛆
<5-16,DAVE BARTON>You slimy little maggot.

150
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,340
<5-16,DAVE BARTON>我要用生锈的勺子捅你
<5-16,DAVE BARTON>I'm gonna stab you with a rusty spoon

151
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:36,160
<5-16,DAVE BARTON>用你的肠子勒死你
<5-16,DAVE BARTON>and strangle you with your own intestines.

152
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,150
<5-16,DAVE BARTON>要不
<5-16,DAVE BARTON>Or better yet,

153
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:39,860
<5-16,DAVE BARTON>我要逼你一个个吃下你的脚趾
<5-16,DAVE BARTON>I'm gonna force-feed you your toes one by one,

154
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,120
<5-16,DAVE BARTON>然后再把你烧了
<5-16,DAVE BARTON>and then I'm gonna light you on fire.

155
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,600
<5-16,DAVE BARTON>首先  我要用羊角锤把你打瘫
<5-16,DAVE BARTON>First, I'm gonna paralyze you with a claw hammer

156
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,830
<5-16,DAVE BARTON>然后往你身上倒一堆蚂蚁  你个混蛋
<5-16,DAVE BARTON>and then cover you with ants, you son of a bitch!

157
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,610
<5-17,ALAN>之后还有一堆
<5-17,ALAN>And it goes on and on like that for a while.

158
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:49,370
<5-18,BECKETT>你就没想着该报警吗
<5-18,BECKETT>And you never thought to call the police?

159
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:51,630
<5-19,ALAN>告戴夫吗  不
<5-19,ALAN>On Dave? No!

160
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,850
<5-19,ALAN>他就是神经比较大条
<5-19,ALAN>He's just got a big personality.

161
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:57,280
<6-1,DAVE BARTON>没办法  我有愤怒问题
<6-1,DAVE BARTON>What can I say? I have anger issues.

162
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,840
<6-2,KEVIN RYAN>以及杀人创意天赋
<6-2,KEVIN RYAN>And a gift for murderous creativity.

163
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:03,860
<6-2,KEVIN RYAN>威胁要"把阿兰的脚钉在天花板上
<6-2,KEVIN RYAN>Threatening to "Nail Alan to the ceiling by his feet

164
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:07,280
<6-2,KEVIN RYAN>用大球棒把他的脸当彩罐打开花"
<6-2,KEVIN RYAN>and pinata the hell out of his face with a Fungo bat."

165
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:08,980
<6-3,DAVE>就是狠话而已
<6-3,DAVE>It's all just talk.

166
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,310
<6-3,DAVE>我其实是晕血的
<6-3,DAVE>I actually get nauseous at the sight of blood.

167
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,740
<6-4,ESPOSITO>所以你决定昨晚给阿兰下毒吗
<6-4,ESPOSITO>Oh, is that why you decided to poison Alan last night?

168
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,520
<6-5,DAVE>我昨晚在家
<6-5,DAVE>Hey, I was home last night

169
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,560
<6-5,DAVE>跟我妻子和岳母在一起
<6-5,DAVE>with my wife and my mother-in-law,

170
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,150
<6-5,DAVE>相信我  那对我的愤怒问题毫无帮助
<6-5,DAVE>which, believe you me, is no good for my anger issues.

171
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:22,190
<6-5,DAVE>那女人简直能逼疯我
<6-5,DAVE>I mean, that woman drives me crazy.

172
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,950
<6-5,DAVE>有时候我真想拿个搅拌机
<6-5,DAVE>Sometimes I just think about getting a blender

173
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,530
<6-5,DAVE>和泥铲
<6-5,DAVE>and a trowel and --

174
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,360
<6-5,DAVE>开玩笑的
<6-5,DAVE>Kidding.

175
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,900
<6-6,RYAN>你最好希望你的不在场证明能核实
<6-6,RYAN>Well, you better hope your alibi holds up,

176
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,630
<6-6,RYAN>你有充足的动机
<6-6,RYAN>'cause you had all the motive in the world.

177
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:33,790
<6-7,DAVE>你要动机
<6-7,DAVE>You want motive?

178
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,790
<6-7,DAVE>我们是安全检查员
<6-7,DAVE>We're safety inspectors.

179
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:37,320
<6-7,DAVE>你以为我们开出
<6-7,DAVE>You think we're making friends

180
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,980
<6-7,DAVE>数百万的罚单能交朋友吗
<6-7,DAVE>handing out millions in fines?

181
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,700
<6-7,DAVE>我们可收不到圣诞贺卡
<6-7,DAVE>We're not getting any Christmas cards.

182
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,160
<6-8,ESPOSITO>尤其是阿兰
<6-8,ESPOSITO>Especially Alan.

183
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,180
<6-8,ESPOSITO>什么意思
<6-8,ESPOSITO>What do you mean, especially Alan?

184
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:46,350
<6-9,DAVE>大家都知道他这人一丝不苟
<6-9,DAVE>The guy's got a rep for being a real stickler.

185
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:47,750
<6-9,DAVE>他不放过任何东西
<6-9,DAVE>He doesn't let anything slide.

186
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,850
<6-10,ESPOSITO>你就是这样吗
<6-10,ESPOSITO>Oh, is that what you did --

187
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:51,130
<6-10,ESPOSITO>为点小钱就放人一马
<6-10,ESPOSITO>let things slide in exchange for a payday?

188
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:53,100
<6-11,DAVE>或许吧  或许没有
<6-11,DAVE>Maybe I did, maybe I didn't.

189
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,290
<6-11,DAVE>那我也不是杀人犯
<6-11,DAVE>Doesn't make me a killer.

190
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:57,550
<6-11,DAVE>重点是  阿兰不肯通融
<6-11,DAVE>The point is that Alan refuses to play the game.

191
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:59,830
<6-11,DAVE>这让很多人生气
<6-11,DAVE>And that pisses off a lot of people.

192
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,710
<7-2,VIKRAM>蕾妮真的宣布了一个活人死亡吗
<7-2,VIKRAM>Did Lanie really declare a live guy dead?

193
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:06,340
<7-3,BECKETT>没有  好吧  是的
<7-3,BECKETT>No. Well, yeah,

194
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:08,320
<7-3,BECKETT>但就算帮你自己个忙  别跟她提
<7-3,BECKETT>but do yourself a favor -- Don't mention it to her.

195
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,470
<7-3,BECKETT>有发现吗
<7-3,BECKETT>So, you got something?

196
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,480
<7-4,VIKRAM>我在洛克塞特方面可能有突破发现
<7-4,VIKRAM>I might have broken open LokSat.

197
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,640
<7-5,BECKETT>你找到他们了
<7-5,BECKETT>You found them?

198
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,460
<7-6,VIKRAM>很不幸  没有  但我找到了另一个人
<7-6,VIKRAM>Unfortunately, no, but I did find someone else.

199
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:18,030
<7-6,VIKRAM>依据卡塞尔发现的洛克塞特飞到
<7-6,VIKRAM>Based on Castle's discovery of the exact time and date

200
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:18,980
<7-6,VIKRAM>洛杉矶的准确日期时间
<7-6,VIKRAM>LokSat flew into L.A.,

201
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:19,760
<7-6,VIKRAM>我一直在看所有
<7-6,VIKRAM>I've been scrubbing footage

202
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,080
<7-6,VIKRAM>洛杉矶附近机场的视频
<7-6,VIKRAM>from all the Los Angeles area airports.

203
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,790
<7-6,VIKRAM>看这是谁
<7-6,VIKRAM>Look who showed up.

205
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,530
<7-7,BECKETT>卡莱布·布朗
<7-7,BECKETT>Caleb Brown?

206
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:29,590
<7-8,VIKRAM>但他是用的假名出行  彼得·麦克加菲
<7-8,VIKRAM>But he was traveling under an alias -- Peter McCaffery.

207
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:32,270
<7-9,BECKETT>卡莱布肯定是去洛杉矶跟洛克塞特见面了
<7-9,BECKETT>So, Caleb must have gone to L.A. To meet with LokSat.

208
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:33,700
<7-9,BECKETT>但开SUV的是谁
<7-9,BECKETT>But who's driving the S.U.V.?

209
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,460
<7-10,VIKRAM>我不知道  我只能看到部分车牌
<7-10,VIKRAM>I don't know. I can only read part of the plate,

210
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,710
<7-10,VIKRAM>但我在列出可能匹配的清单
<7-10,VIKRAM>but I'm generating a list of possible matches.

211
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:38,540
<7-10,VIKRAM>警监
<7-10,VIKRAM>Captain.

212
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,430
<7-11,RYAN>戴夫·巴顿的不在场证明核实了
<7-11,RYAN>Dave Barton alibied out,

213
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:43,250
<7-11,RYAN>但我们在列出阿兰最近
<7-11,RYAN>but we're getting a list of all the companies

214
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:46,110
<7-11,RYAN>罚了款或停了业的店家名单
<7-11,RYAN>that Alan has either fined or shut down for violations recently.

215
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,620
<7-11,RYAN>然后我们会让阿兰看一遍清单
<7-11,RYAN>Then we're gonna run the list past Alan.

216
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:49,240
<7-12,BECKETT>他的未遂杀人犯还逍遥在外
<7-12,BECKETT>Whose would-be killer is still out there,

217
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,710
<7-12,BECKETT>你采取了什么防范措施
<7-12,BECKETT>so what precautions are you taking?

218
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:52,390
<7-13,RYAN>警车把他从医院接回家了
<7-13,RYAN>Squad car just brought him home from the hospital.

219
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:54,290
<7-13,RYAN>我们派了警员在他门外站岗
<7-13,RYAN>We got a uniform posted outside his door,

220
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:58,070
<7-13,RYAN>所以他唯一真正的担忧  是你丈夫
<7-13,RYAN>which makes his only real concern your husband.

221
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,320
<7-14,BECKETT>嗯
<7-14,BECKETT>Yeah.

222
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:02,330
<8-1,CASTLE>你死而重生了
<8-1,CASTLE>So, you have died and been reborn.

223
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:03,340
<8-1,CASTLE>你现在打算怎么办
<8-1,CASTLE>What are you gonna do now?

224
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,340
<8-2,ALAN>上床睡觉
<8-2,ALAN>Going to bed.

225
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,430
<8-2,ALAN>我明天还有一整天的检查要做呢
<8-2,ALAN>I have a full day of inspections tomorrow.

226
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,570
<8-2,ALAN>我得精神振奋
<8-2,ALAN>I need to be focused.

227
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,500
<8-2,ALAN>你不能装作什么都没发生似的回去工作
<8-2,ALAN>You can't just go back to work like nothing happened.

228
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,070
<8-3,CASTLE>这是一次频死经历  是一记警钟啊
<8-3,CASTLE>You had a near-death experience. That's a wake-up call.

229
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:12,610
<8-3,CASTLE>走入世界
<8-3,CASTLE>Get out there.

230
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:14,550
<8-3,CASTLE>过上你一直梦想的生活吧
<8-3,CASTLE>Live this life you've always dreamed about.

231
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:16,750
<8-4,ALAN>我墙上虽然挂了些照片
<8-4,ALAN>Just because I have a few pictures on my wall

232
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,730
<8-4,ALAN>不代表我对生活有什么不满
<8-4,ALAN>doesn't mean I'm not happy with my life.

233
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:21,670
<8-5,CASTLE>是啊  你枯燥孤独的生活
<8-5,CASTLE>Right. Your drab, solitary life.

234
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,220
<8-6,ALAN>才不孤独呢
<8-6,ALAN>It's not solitary.

235
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,370
<8-7,CASTLE>那么有位安全检查员太太吗
<8-7,CASTLE>So there's a Ms. Safety Inspector?

236
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,650
<8-8,ALAN>没有
<8-8,ALAN>Not exactly.

237
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,310
<8-8,ALAN>但我有个心仪的女人
<8-8,ALAN>But there is a woman I have my eye on.

238
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,240
<8-8,ALAN>她幽默  聪明
<8-8,ALAN>She's funny and smart.

239
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,170
<8-9,CASTLE>-但不知道你的存在  -不知道
<8-9,CASTLE>- Doesn't know you exist? - No.

240
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:35,320
<8-10,ALAN>安全
<8-10,ALAN>All clear.

241
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,870
<8-11,OFFICER>如果你需要什么  我就在门外
<8-11,OFFICER>I'll be right outside if you need anything.

242
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,110
<8-12,ALAN>很好  谢谢
<8-12,ALAN>Great, thanks.

243
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,010
<8-13,CASTLE>你该打给这个女人
<8-13,CASTLE>You should really call this woman.

244
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,200
<8-14,ALAN>好  我会的
<8-14,ALAN>Okay, I will.

245
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:43,530
<8-15,CASTLE>你真不记得死亡的任何事了吗
<8-15,CASTLE>And you honestly don't remember anything about being dead?

246
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:44,440
<8-15,CASTLE>真心不
<8-15,CASTLE>Really don't.

247
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:54,960
<9-1,CASTLE>谁会那样啊  谁会那样得到第二次机会
<9-1,CASTLE>Who does that? Who gets a second chance like that

248
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,500
<9-1,CASTLE>然后第二天还起来去上班
<9-1,CASTLE>and just goes to work the next morning?

249
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,420
<9-2,OFFICER>我会的  我喜欢工作
<9-2,OFFICER>I would. I like work.

250
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:07,900
<9-3,CASTLE>阿兰
<9-3,CASTLE>Alan!

251
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:19,400
<9-4,OFFICER>有人在床上动了手脚  想电死他
<9-4,OFFICER>Someone rigged the bed to electrocute him.

252
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:21,150
<9-4,OFFICER>他死了吗
<9-4,OFFICER>Is he dead?

253
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:28,970
<9-5,LANIE>抱歉  卡塞尔  他这次真的死了
<9-5,LANIE>Sorry, Castle, but this time, he really is dead.

254
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,620
<9-6,CASTLE>真是可惜
<9-6,CASTLE>What a waste.

255
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:32,920
<9-7,LANIE>得到了第二次机会
<9-7,LANIE>To be given a second chance

256
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,000
<9-7,LANIE>然后又这样被夺走
<9-7,LANIE>and have it taken away like this.

257
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:37,310
<9-8,CASTLE>他原打算像没事人一样回去工作
<9-8,CASTLE>He was just gonna go back to work like nothing happened.

258
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,190
<9-9,LANIE>什么
<9-9,LANIE>What?

259
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,180
<9-10,CASTLE>如果我不是那么专注于他的重生
<9-10,CASTLE>If I hadn't been so focused on his rebirth,

260
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,780
<9-10,CASTLE>本可能会注意到电线的
<9-10,CASTLE>I might have noticed that wire.

261
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,980
<9-10,CASTLE>我本可以救他的
<9-10,CASTLE>I could have saved him.

262
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,230
<9-11,LANIE>别自责  卡塞尔
<9-11,LANIE>You can't beat yourself up, Castle.

263
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:48,610
<9-11,LANIE>我还以为他是个医学奇迹呢
<9-11,LANIE>I was starting to think he was some kind of medical miracle.

264
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:49,980
<9-11,LANIE>原来他之前只是走运
<9-11,LANIE>Turns out, he was just lucky.

265
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,360
<9-11,LANIE>最终  他的运气也用光了
<9-11,LANIE>And in the end, his luck ran out.

266
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:03,730
<9-12,CASTLE>什么运气啊
<9-12,CASTLE>Forget lucky.

267
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,320
<9-13,ALAN>有人烤肉了吗
<9-13,ALAN>Somebody cooking barbecue?

268
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:09,520
<9-14,CASTLE>他有不死之身
<9-14,CASTLE>He's immortal.

278
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,680
<10-1,LANIE>-他之前绝对死了  -你上次就那么说的
<10-1,LANIE>- He was definitely dead. - That's what you said last time.

279
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:22,090
<10-2,LANIE>他上次也死了
<10-2,LANIE>He was dead the last time, too.

280
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:22,840
<10-3,BECKETT>抱歉
<10-3,BECKETT>Uh, sorry.

281
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,180
<10-3,BECKETT>能让我们说一句吗
<10-3,BECKETT>Um, can we have a minute, please?

282
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,480
<10-4,BECKETT>-当然  -谢谢
<10-4,BECKETT>- Of course. - Thanks.

283
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,610
<10-4,BECKETT>抱歉  我好凌乱
<10-4,BECKETT>I'm sorry. I'm just rattled.

284
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:30,180
<10-5,LANIE>人是可能中毒或触电
<10-5,LANIE>You know, people can come back from being poisoned

285
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:33,070
<10-5,LANIE>而不死  但一天两次
<10-5,LANIE>and from being electrocuted, but both in the same day?

286
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:34,640
<10-6,BECKETT>有什么解释吗
<10-6,BECKETT>So, is there an explanation?

287
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,650
<10-7,LANIE>我能想到两个
<10-7,LANIE>I can think of two.

288
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:37,150
<10-7,LANIE>要么我是工作能力不行
<10-7,LANIE>Either I'm really bad at my job

289
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:39,160
<10-7,LANIE>要么卡塞尔是对的  这人有不死之身
<10-7,LANIE>or Castle's right and this guy is immortal.

290
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,510
<10-8,BECKETT>他不是不死之身
<10-8,BECKETT>He is not immortal,

291
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:42,910
<10-8,BECKETT>你在工作上是个天才
<10-8,BECKETT>and you are a genius at your job.

292
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,490
<10-8,BECKETT>我们得继续寻找答案
<10-8,BECKETT>We just got to keep looking for answers,

293
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:46,890
<10-8,BECKETT>首先就是谁那么想杀了他
<10-8,BECKETT>starting with who wants to kill this guy so badly.

294
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,760
<10-9,LANIE>第二次刺杀企图有什么鉴证证据吗
<10-9,LANIE>Is there any forensics on the second attempt?

295
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,930
<10-10,BECKETT>没有  床肯定是
<10-10,BECKETT>No. The bed must have been wired

296
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:53,050
<10-10,BECKETT>结束了犯罪现场证据搜集后
<10-10,BECKETT>after the apartment was already released

297
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:54,160
<10-10,BECKETT>才布上了线
<10-10,BECKETT>from being a crime scene,

298
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,220
<10-10,BECKETT>所以凶手在阿兰和卡塞尔回去之前
<10-10,BECKETT>which means the killer had about a two-hour window

299
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:59,290
<10-10,BECKETT>有两小时的时机
<10-10,BECKETT>before Alan and Castle got there.

300
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,630
<10-11,RYAN>本该杀死阿兰的毒素  河豚毒素
<10-11,RYAN>So, the toxin that should have killed Alan, TTX,

301
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,070
<10-11,RYAN>是一种管制药物
<10-11,RYAN>is a controlled substance,

302
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,700
<10-11,RYAN>只有少数制药公司有
<10-11,RYAN>available through only a few pharma supply companies.

303
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,750
<10-11,RYAN>疾控中心正要发名单给我们
<10-11,RYAN>CDC is sending us over a list right.

304
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,290
<10-12,LANIE>那么找到买家或许就能找到凶手
<10-12,LANIE>So, finding the buyer might lead to the killer.

305
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:16,090
<10-13,RYAN>知道阿兰为什么还没死吗
<10-13,RYAN>Any idea how our boy Alan is still with us?

306
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:18,970
<10-14,BECKETT>不知道  但卡塞尔有个理论
<10-14,BECKETT>Uh, no. But Castle has a theory.

307
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,370
<11-1,CASTLE>你是个超级英雄
<11-1,CASTLE>You are a superhero.

308
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:24,040
<11-2,ALAN>我真不是  我就是个普通人
<11-2,ALAN>No, I'm really not. I'm just an ordinary guy.

309
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,520
<11-3,CASTLE>你本来是个普通人  阿兰
<11-3,CASTLE>You were an ordinary guy, Alan.

310
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:28,400
<11-3,CASTLE>大部分超级英雄起初就是这样
<11-3,CASTLE>That's how most superheroes start out --

311
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:31,580
<11-3,CASTLE>温和弱小的人  这就是你
<11-3,CASTLE>mild-mannered weaklings, and that's you!

312
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,780
<11-4,ALAN>多谢夸奖
<11-4,ALAN>Wow, thanks.

313
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:36,660
<11-5,CASTLE>放心  这都是为了突出你的转化
<11-5,CASTLE>Relax. It's all to maximize your transformative arc.

314
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:39,730
<11-6,ALAN>如果我认同你的看法  你能让我一个人静静吗
<11-6,ALAN>If I agree with you, will you leave me alone?

315
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:42,300
<11-7,CASTLE>别傻了  我们这才开始
<11-7,CASTLE>Don't be silly. We're just getting started!

316
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,260
<11-7,CASTLE>首先  我们得想明白
<11-7,CASTLE>First, we need to figure out

317
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,920
<11-7,CASTLE>是什么触发了你的转化
<11-7,CASTLE>what triggered your transformation,

318
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,620
<11-7,CASTLE>可以说是你的起源故事
<11-7,CASTLE>your origin story, if you will.

319
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:48,430
<11-8,ALAN>为什么
<11-8,ALAN>Why?

320
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:50,450
<11-9,CASTLE>因为起源故事就是一切
<11-9,CASTLE>Because the origin story is everything!

321
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:52,740
<11-9,CASTLE>关于这个有九部蜘蛛侠故事吧
<11-9,CASTLE>What, there's, what, nine Spider-Man movies about it?

322
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:53,520
<11-10,ESPOSITO>喂
<11-10,ESPOSITO>Yo.

323
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,230
<11-10,ESPOSITO>有线索了
<11-10,ESPOSITO>We got a lead.

324
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:57,600
<11-11,CASTLE>我们得给阿兰想个超级英雄名字
<11-11,CASTLE>We need to come up with a superhero name for Alan.

325
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,180
<11-12,ALAN>不不  不需要
<11-12,ALAN>No. No, we really don't.

326
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,300
<11-13,ESPOSITO>安全侠怎么样
<11-13,ESPOSITO>How about... Safety Man?

327
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,260
<11-14,CASTLE>烂透了
<11-14,CASTLE>No, that's terrible.

328
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,310
<11-15,ESPOSITO>他有其他超能力吗
<11-15,ESPOSITO>Well, does he have any other powers?

329
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:05,660
<11-16,CASTLE>不知道  我们该检测一下
<11-16,CASTLE>I don't know. We should really run some tests.

330
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:08,140
<11-17,ALAN>你刚提到了线索
<11-17,ALAN>Um, you said something about a lead...

331
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:10,770
<11-18,ESPOSITO>是啊  我们查了一下你的检查历史
<11-18,ESPOSITO>Right. Yeah, we've been checking into your inspection history

332
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:12,880
<11-18,ESPOSITO>看你是否惹怒了什么人
<11-18,ESPOSITO>to see if there's somebody you might have pissed off.

333
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,890
<11-18,ESPOSITO>可能找到了  赞提姆实验室
<11-18,ESPOSITO>I think we have a winner -- Zantium Labs.

334
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:16,460
<11-18,ESPOSITO>你刚给他们开了六位数的罚单
<11-18,ESPOSITO>You just hit them with a six-figure fine.

335
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,530
<11-19,ALAN>是啊  他们是一家生物制药公司
<11-19,ALAN>Yeah, they're a biopharmaceutical company.

336
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,320
<11-19,ALAN>他们两天前发生了
<11-19,ALAN>I threatened to shut them down

337
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,810
<11-19,ALAN>严重化学品泄漏事故  我威胁要关停他们
<11-19,ALAN>after they had a bad chemical spill two days ago.

338
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:24,990
<11-20,CASTLE>化学品泄漏事故
<11-20,CASTLE>A chemical spill?

339
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:25,930
<11-20,CASTLE>谜题解决了
<11-20,CASTLE>Mystery solved.

340
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:29,320
<11-20,CASTLE>接触危险物质是最常见的
<11-20,CASTLE>Exposure to dangerous materials is the most common

341
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,030
<11-20,CASTLE>超级英雄起源故事
<11-20,CASTLE>superhero origin story there is.

342
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,850
<11-21,ALAN>抱歉  泄漏的是LAH
<11-21,ALAN>Sorry. The spill was L.A.H.

343
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:35,240
<11-21,ALAN>是一种无机化合物  是作为催化剂
<11-21,ALAN>It's an inorganic compound used as a catalyst

344
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,820
<11-21,ALAN>制作其他化合物的
<11-21,ALAN>to make other chemicals, which --

345
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,680
<11-21,ALAN>重点是  这东西有爆炸性
<11-21,ALAN>The point is, it can be explosive,

346
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,490
<11-21,ALAN>但是绝不会把人变成
<11-21,ALAN>but there's nothing about it that would ever turn anyone

347
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:42,030
<11-21,ALAN>该怎么说呢
<11-21,ALAN>into a, I don't know...

348
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,470
<11-21,ALAN>酷毙队长
<11-21,ALAN>Captain Cool?

349
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:46,770
<11-22,CASTLE>不  继续想
<11-22,CASTLE>No. But keep trying.

350
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,330
<11-23,ESPOSITO>这次泄漏的责任人是谁
<11-23,ESPOSITO>Hey, who's on the hook for that spill?

351
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,900
<11-24,ALAN>实验室经理  弗兰克·帕切特
<11-24,ALAN>The lab manager, Frank Patchett.

352
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,530
<11-24,ALAN>他求我不要开罚单的
<11-24,ALAN>He begged me not to fine him.

353
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,930
<11-24,ALAN>他说实验室在大量流失资金
<11-24,ALAN>He said the lab was hemorrhaging money.

354
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:55,770
<11-25,ESPOSITO>听上去像动机
<11-25,ESPOSITO>That sounds like motive.

355
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:57,120
<11-25,ESPOSITO>走吧  卡塞尔  我们去跟他谈谈
<11-25,ESPOSITO>Come on, Castle. Let's go talk to this guy.

356
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,190
<11-26,ALAN>等等
<11-26,ALAN>Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

357
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:00,350
<11-26,ALAN>或许我该一起去
<11-26,ALAN>Maybe I should come with you.

358
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:01,390
<11-27,CASTLE>为什么
<11-27,CASTLE>Why?

359
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:03,260
<11-28,ALAN>不为什么
<11-28,ALAN>No reason.

360
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:06,020
<11-29,CASTLE>那姑娘
<11-29,CASTLE>The girl.

361
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,170
<11-29,CASTLE>就是还不知道你存在的那个
<11-29,CASTLE>The one who doesn't know you exist.

362
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:09,230
<11-29,CASTLE>她在那儿工作  是吧
<11-29,CASTLE>She works there, doesn't she?

363
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:12,000
<11-30,ALAN>不是  是
<11-30,ALAN>No. Yes.

364
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:13,910
<11-30,ALAN>她叫格温  营销部的
<11-30,ALAN>Her name is Gwen. She's in marketing.

365
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,840
<11-31,ESPOSITO>抱歉  阿兰  你得待在这里
<11-31,ESPOSITO>Sorry, Alan. You got to stay here.

366
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,070
<11-31,ESPOSITO>如果赞提姆实验室有人想杀你

367
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:20,100
<11-31,ESPOSITO>而我还带你去那儿  那我就是最差劲的警察了
<11-31,ESPOSITO>I'd be the worst cop on the force if I took you there.

368
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,360
<11-31,ESPOSITO>别担心  阿兰

371
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:28,740
<12-1,GWEN PARKER>真不敢相信会有人那么害可怜的阿兰
<12-1,GWEN PARKER>I can't believe someone would try and do that to poor Alan.

<12-1,GWEN PARKER>他人那么好
<12-1,GWEN PARKER>He's such a sweet man.

00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,180
<13-2,GWEN>这里的人挺恨他的
<13-2,GWEN>People around here kind of hate him,

375
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,740
<13-2,GWEN>但  怎么说呢  我觉得他挺逗的
<13-2,GWEN>but, I don't know, I think he's really funny.

376
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,830
<13-3,CASTLE>我会转告的
<13-3,CASTLE>Oh, I'll tell him you said that.

<13-6,ESPOSITO>我要问你几个关于阿兰·马斯特斯的问题
<13-6,ESPOSITO>I need to ask you a few questions about Alan Masters.

381

<13-7,FRANK PATCHETT>他还好吧
<13-7,FRANK PATCHETT>Is he doing okay?

382
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,030
<13-7,FRANK PATCHETT>我听说有人企图杀他
<13-7,FRANK PATCHETT>I heard someone tried to kill him.

<13-11,CASTLE>除了阿兰
<13-11,CASTLE>Nobody except Alan.

388
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,760
<13-12,FRANK>你觉得他的遭遇跟泄漏事故有关吗
<13-12,FRANK>You think what happened to him is connected to the spill?

389
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:00,950
<13-12,FRANK>或许吧
<13-12,FRANK>Maybe.

<14-5,CASTLE>如果你要在这个实验室里选一样
<14-5,CASTLE>Look, um, if you had to pick something in this lab

<14-7,CASTLE>super-soldier serum --

405
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,340
<14-8,MIKE>嗯  我们这儿没有那种东西
<14-8,MIKE>Yeah, we don't have anything like that here.

<14-9,CASTLE>那这个呢
<14-9,CASTLE>Then what is -- What about this?

00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:56,720
<14-9,CASTLE>你们这儿忙什么呢
<14-9,CASTLE>What are you working on right here?

408
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,070
<14-10,MIKE>我们发现了刺激老鼠
<14-10,MIKE>We've discovered an accelerated method

409
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:59,740
<14-10,MIKE>发细胞加速生长的办法
<14-10,MIKE>for growing hair cells in the mice.

410
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,700
<14-11,CASTLE>加速细胞再生
<14-11,CASTLE>Accelerated cell regeneration?

411
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,430
<14-11,CASTLE>这或许是通往永生的关键
<14-11,CASTLE>That could be the key to immortality.

412
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,580
<15-1,FRANK>我这48小时里一直在
<15-1,FRANK>I've been supervising this cleanup

413
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:07,830
<15-1,FRANK>监督清理的事
<15-1,FRANK>for the last 48 hours.

414
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:09,640
<15-1,FRANK>就算我想杀阿兰
<15-1,FRANK>Even if I wanted to kill Alan,

415
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,870
<15-1,FRANK>我也没有时机或精力
<15-1,FRANK>I didn't have the opportunity or the energy.

416
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,230
<15-2,ESPOSITO>但你有动机
<15-2,ESPOSITO>But you did have the motive.

417
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:16,180
<15-2,ESPOSITO>你求他不要开罚单  但他还是开了
<15-2,ESPOSITO>You begged him not to fine you, and he did anyway.

418
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,220
<15-2,ESPOSITO>是啊
<15-2,ESPOSITO>Yeah.

419
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,550
<15-3,FRANK>他很烦人  但损害已经造成了
<15-3,FRANK>He's a pain in the ass, but the damage was already done.

420
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:21,370
<15-3,FRANK>杀了他也不会得到什么
<15-3,FRANK>Killing him would have accomplished nothing.

421
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:23,350
<15-3,FRANK>我送他去停车场时
<15-3,FRANK>You know, something odd did happen

422
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:24,870
<15-3,FRANK>的确发生了怪事
<15-3,FRANK>when I walked him out to the parking lot.

423
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:25,710
<15-4,ESPOSITO>什么怪事
<15-4,ESPOSITO>Odd how?

424
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:27,070
<15-5,FRANK>有人当时在阿兰的车附近
<15-5,FRANK>There was someone hanging out at Alan's car,

425
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:28,760
<15-5,FRANK>但看到我们走来就走开了
<15-5,FRANK>but he took off when he saw us coming.

426
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,460
<15-5,FRANK>我当时没怎么细想  但是
<15-5,FRANK>I didn't think much of it at the time, but...

427
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,950
<15-6,ESPOSITO>你们停车场有监控吗
<15-6,ESPOSITO>Does your parking lot have security cameras?

428
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,670
<15-6,ESPOSITO>-有  -我看看
<15-6,ESPOSITO>- Yeah. - Let me see him.

429
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:37,700
<16-1,BECKETT>休姆先生  你是最近被阿兰关停的一家
<16-1,BECKETT>Mr. Hume, so you're an operations manager at a plastics factory

430
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,140
<16-1,BECKETT>塑料厂的营运经理
<16-1,BECKETT>that Alan recently shut down.

431
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,060
<16-1,BECKETT>对吗
<16-1,BECKETT>Is that correct?

432
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:42,010
<16-2,GLEN HUME>我没把阿兰怎么样  我是无辜的
<16-2,GLEN HUME>I didn't do anything to Alan. I'm innocent.

433
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:44,670
<16-3,ESPOSITO>无辜者一般不会跟到受害者的停车场去
<16-3,ESPOSITO>Innocent men don't usually stalk their victims in parking lots.

434
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:47,520
<16-4,HUME>我就是想跟阿兰谈谈而已
<16-4,HUME>I just wanted to talk to Alan. That's all.

435
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:49,900
<16-4,HUME>我需要找到合适的时机
<16-4,HUME>I needed to find the right moment.

436
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,350
<16-4,HUME>我们得单独谈
<16-4,HUME>We had to be alone.

437
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,180
<16-4,HUME>好吧
<16-4,HUME>Okay.

438
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:53,860
<16-5,BECKETT>你想跟他谈什么
<16-5,BECKETT>What did you want to talk to him about?

439
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:58,080
<16-5,BECKETT>休姆先生  如果你只是想跟他谈
<16-5,BECKETT>Mr. Hume, if all you wanted to do was talk to him,

440
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,230
<16-5,BECKETT>那为什么警员找到你时
<16-5,BECKETT>then why did UNIs find you

441
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:01,890
<16-5,BECKETT>你带着两个箱子和一张去墨西哥的票
<16-5,BECKETT>with two suitcases and a ticket to Mexico?

442
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:04,000
<16-6,HUME>因为我不想死
<16-6,HUME>Because I don't want to die.

443
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,130
<16-6,HUME>他们找上了阿兰  那我就是下一个了
<16-6,HUME>They came after Alan and I'm next.

444
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:07,930
<16-6,HUME>"他们"是谁
<16-6,HUME>Who's "they"?

445
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,200
<16-7,ESPOSITO>如果你知道是谁想杀阿兰  你得告诉我们
<16-7,ESPOSITO>If you know who went after Alan, you need to tell us.

446
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,250
<16-8,BECKETT>是你们公司的人吗
<16-8,BECKETT>Was it someone from your company?

447
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,590
<16-9,ESPOSITO>你是告密者吗  格伦
<16-9,ESPOSITO>Are you a whistle-blower, Glen?

448
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:17,140
<16-9,ESPOSITO>你是想揭露什么吗
<16-9,ESPOSITO>Is there something you're trying to expose?

449
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,990
<16-9,ESPOSITO>你是为这个找阿兰吗
<16-9,ESPOSITO>Is that why you wanted to talk to Alan?

450
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:21,730
<16-10,BECKETT>纽约警局可以保护你
<16-10,BECKETT>The NYPD can protect you,

451
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,520
<16-10,BECKETT>如果真有人想杀你
<16-10,BECKETT>and if someone really is trying to kill you,

452
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,980
<16-10,BECKETT>你待在我们这里
<16-10,BECKETT>you're a lot safer in here with us

453
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,770
<16-10,BECKETT>比自己在外更安全
<16-10,BECKETT>than out there, on your own.

454
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,110
<16-10,BECKETT>好吧
<16-10,BECKETT>Okay.

455
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,360
<16-11,HUME>但不是我们公司的人
<16-11,HUME>But it's not someone from my company.

456
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,040
<17-1,ALAN>是黑帮
<17-1,ALAN>It's the mob.

457
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,440
<16-12,BECKETT>有组织犯罪跟阿兰怎么会扯上关系
<16-12,BECKETT>What would organized crime want with Alan?

458
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:39,890
<16-12,BECKETT>废物管理
<16-12,BECKETT>Waste management.

459
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:40,740
<16-12,BECKETT>对
<16-12,BECKETT>Yeah.

460
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:43,110
<16-13,HUME>他们逼我跟他们签下
<16-13,HUME>They strong-armed me into giving them the contract

461
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:45,330
<16-13,HUME>我公司危险废料处理的合约
<16-13,HUME>for my factory's hazardous-waste disposal.

462
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:47,770
<16-13,HUME>他们在城里到处这么干
<16-13,HUME>They've been doing the same thing all over town.

463
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:50,480
<16-13,HUME>他们直接把这些东西倾倒进垃圾堆
<16-13,HUME>And they just dump the stuff into the landfill.

464
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,280
<16-14,ESPOSITO>他们为什么会先找上阿兰
<16-14,ESPOSITO>So, why would they target Alan before you?

465
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,520
<16-15,BECKETT>因为阿兰解雇了戴夫·巴顿
<16-15,BECKETT>Because Alan fired Dave Barton,

466
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:56,740
<16-15,BECKETT>他们唯一能买通的检查员
<16-15,BECKETT>the only inspector that they could buy.

467
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,510
<16-15,BECKETT>所以阿兰成了碍事的
<16-15,BECKETT>So Alan was becoming a big problem,

468
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:00,780
<16-15,BECKETT>他们唯一的解决方案就是杀了他
<16-15,BECKETT>and their only solution was to kill him.

469
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:04,340
<17-1,ALAN>黑帮想杀我
<17-1,ALAN>The mob is trying to kill me?

470
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:06,960
<17-2,CASTLE>想  但没成功  知道为什么吗
<17-2,CASTLE>Trying and failing. But do you know why?

471
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,430
<17-3,ALAN>因为我是  落健侠吗
<17-3,ALAN>Because I'm -- I'm, what, Rogaine Man?

472
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:10,670
<17-4,CASTLE>恶心  最糟的一个名字了
<17-4,CASTLE>Yuck. Worst name yet.

473
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:12,860
<17-4,CASTLE>但这能解释你为什么总能起死回生
<17-4,CASTLE>But it does explain why you keep coming back to life.

474
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:15,620
<17-4,CASTLE>你的细胞以惊人速度重生
<17-4,CASTLE>Your cells regenerate at an amazing rate.

475
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:17,040
<17-5,LANIE>但是并没有
<17-5,LANIE>Except they don't.

476
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:18,440
<17-6,CASTLE>什么
<17-6,CASTLE>What?

477
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,820
<17-7,LANIE>刚拿到了检测结果
<17-7,LANIE>Just got the test back.

478
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:22,270
<17-7,LANIE>血液和组织细胞都没有
<17-7,LANIE>No sign of abnormal regenerative activity

512
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:30,430
<18-2,ESPOSITO>是一家新公司  叫做靶眼
<18-2,ESPOSITO>It's a new entity called Bullseye.

513
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:31,480
<18-2,ESPOSITO>我们不清楚经营者是谁
<18-2,ESPOSITO>We're not sure who's running it,

515
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,330
<18-2,ESPOSITO>不对劲
<18-2,ESPOSITO>I don't know.

516
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:36,660
<18-3,BECKETT>触电和下毒不像黑帮的作风
<18-3,BECKETT>Electrocution and poisoning doesn't sound like the mob.

517
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,550
<18-5,RYAN>-是啊  -除非是不想引起注意
<18-5,RYAN>- No. - Unless they're trying to keep a low profile.

518
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,520
<18-5,RYAN>不引起我们注意的最好办法是别张扬
<18-5,RYAN>The best way to stay off our radar is to fly under it.

519
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,780
<18-6,BECKETT>是啊
<18-6,BECKETT>Yeah, true.

520
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:43,470
<18-6,BECKETT>你们去二楼
<18-6,BECKETT>Why don't you guys head down to the second floor,

521
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:45,360
<18-6,BECKETT>看看有组织犯罪有什么看法
<18-6,BECKETT>see if Organized Crime has any insight?

522
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,250
<18-6,BECKETT>好的
<18-6,BECKETT>Okay.

523
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:50,040
<19-1,CASTLE>我们知道你能扛过中毒和触电
<19-1,CASTLE>We know you can survive poisoning and electrocution.

524
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:53,510
<19-1,CASTLE>现在该看看你是否能扛过穿透伤了
<19-1,CASTLE>Now it's time to see if you can survive penetrative wounds.

525
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:55,580
<19-2,ALAN>我们从小点的东西起步吧
<19-2,ALAN>How about if we start with some smaller,

526
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:57,110
<19-2,ALAN>比如纸割手
<19-2,ALAN>like a paper cut?

527
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:59,320
<19-3,CASTLE>好吧  这有点过了
<19-3,CASTLE>Okay, this is all a little overwhelming.

<19-3,CASTLE>我理解  好
<19-3,CASTLE>I understand. All right.

529
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:02,680
<19-3,CASTLE>我们先试试其他的超能力吧
<19-3,CASTLE>Let's -- Let's test for some other powers first.

530
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,870
<19-4,CASTLE>念力
<19-4,CASTLE>Telekinesis.

531
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:05,910
<19-4,CASTLE>试试用你的意念移动钢琴
<19-4,CASTLE>Try to move the piano with your mind.

532
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:09,520
<19-5,ALAN>如果我做了  你能告诉我格温的事吗
<19-5,ALAN>If I try this, will you tell me about Gwen?

00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,660
<19-8,CASTLE>那是个小伎俩
<19-8,CASTLE>That was a trick.

536
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:20,060
<19-8,CASTLE>是想测试蜘蛛侠的灵敏感知
<19-8,CASTLE>I was actually testing for Spidey-sense.

537
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,140
<19-9,ALAN>我没有
<19-9,ALAN>I don't have it!

538
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:22,060

00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:17,910
<19-42,ALAN>而和格温共进晚餐
<19-42,ALAN>and my dinner with Gwen

594
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:19,640
<19-42,ALAN>将会是好事降临的开端
<19-42,ALAN>will be the beginning of something really terrific!

595
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,880
<19-43,CASTLE>就是这种范儿  阿兰  我要跟你一起去
<19-43,CASTLE>That's the spirit, Alan. And I'm going with you.

596
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,550
<19-44,ALAN>求你别去
<19-44,ALAN>Please don't.

597
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:23,800
<19-45,CASTLE>谋害你性命最初的两次尝试
<19-45,CASTLE>The first two attempts on your life

598
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,840
<19-45,CASTLE>本来是想低调悄无声息
<19-45,CASTLE>were meant to be anonymous, quiet.

599
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,750
<19-45,CASTLE>他们不太可能会明目张胆地动手
<19-45,CASTLE>It's very unlikely they'd try something in a public place.

600
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:28,630
<19-46,ALAN>就是
<19-46,ALAN>Exactly.

601
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:29,570
<19-47,CASTLE>但他们的确两次都失手了
<19-47,CASTLE>Well, they did fail twice.

602
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:30,720
<19-47,CASTLE>他们可能会变本加厉
<19-47,CASTLE>They may try to kick it up a notch.

603
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,020
<19-48,ALAN>什么意思
<19-48,ALAN>What are you saying?

604
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:34,480
<19-49,CASTLE>别点开胃菜
<19-49,CASTLE>Don't order an appetizer.

605
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:53,710
<19-49,CASTLE>最新美剧下载
<19-49,CASTLE>www.ZiMuZu.tv

606
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:41,810
<20-1,BECKETT>你发现什么线索了吗
<20-1,BECKETT>You found something.

607
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:42,650
<20-1,BECKETT>是的
<20-1,BECKETT>Yeah.

608
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,640
<20-2,VIKRAM>我查了卡莱布·布朗
<20-2,VIKRAM>I ran the partial plate

609
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,420
<20-2,VIKRAM>上的那辆越野车的部分车牌
<20-2,VIKRAM>from that S.U.V. Caleb Brown got into,

610
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:47,620
<20-2,VIKRAM>拿到了一个名单
<20-2,VIKRAM>generated a list of names.

611
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,980
<20-2,VIKRAM>猜猜看谁在上面
<20-2,VIKRAM>Guess who's on it.

612
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:50,900
<20-3,BECKETT>布鲁克斯
<20-3,BECKETT>Brooks.

613
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,110
<20-3,BECKETT>那个拿了一袋子蜘蛛的家伙
<20-3,BECKETT>Guy with the bag of spiders

614
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,820
<20-3,BECKETT>想干掉我和卡塞尔来着
<20-3,BECKETT>who tried to take down Castle and me.

622
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,430
<20-4,VIKRAM>如果是布鲁克斯在机场去接的卡莱布
<20-4,VIKRAM>If Brooks picked up Caleb at the airport,

623
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:57,980
<20-4,VIKRAM>这就把卡莱布和洛克塞特直接联系起来了
<20-4,VIKRAM>then this ties Caleb directly to LokSat.

631
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:00,140
<20-5,BECKETT>听着  这只是个开始而已
<20-5,BECKETT>Well, look, it's a start anyway.

632
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:01,980
<20-6,VIKRAM>开始吗  这可是照片证据
<20-6,VIKRAM>A start? It's photographic evidence.

633
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:04,460
<20-7,BECKETT>什么的证据  他跟一个坏人上了车吗
<20-7,BECKETT>Of what? That he got into a car with a bad guy?

634
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,950
<20-7,BECKETT>卡莱布是公辩律师  他为坏人说话
<20-7,BECKETT>Caleb's a public defender. He represents bad guys.

635
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,310
<20-8,VIKRAM>他用的是假名
<20-8,VIKRAM>He was using an alias.

636
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:10,480
<20-8,VIKRAM>我们可以拿着这个去找卡莱布
<20-8,VIKRAM>We can use this to go at Caleb,

637
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,860
<20-8,VIKRAM>让他说出洛克塞特的身份
<20-8,VIKRAM>get him to reveal LokSat's identity.

638
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:14,550
<20-9,BECKETT>直到他告知洛克塞特我们在查他
<20-9,BECKETT>Until he alerts LokSat that we're onto him,

639
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:16,030
<20-9,BECKETT>我们就都没命了
<20-9,BECKETT>and then we're all dead.

640
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,240
<20-9,BECKETT>不行  我们等直到找到更确切的证据
<20-9,BECKETT>No, we got to wait until we have something more concrete.

641
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,160
<20-9,BECKETT>好吧
<20-9,BECKETT>Fine.

642
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,170
<20-10,VIKRAM>卡莱布的假名  彼得·麦克加菲
<20-10,VIKRAM>Caleb's alias -- Peter McCaffery.

643
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:22,760
<20-10,VIKRAM>我会继续查下去
<20-10,VIKRAM>I'll look into and see

644
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:24,650
<20-10,VIKRAM>以这个名字进行过其他出行
<20-10,VIKRAM>what other trips he's taken under that name,

645
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:26,890
<20-10,VIKRAM>看能不能查到更明确的线索
<20-10,VIKRAM>see if it leads somewhere more definitive.

646
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,750
<20-11,BECKETT>我明白这让人很丧气
<20-11,BECKETT>Look, I know this is frustrating.

647
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,180
<20-11,BECKETT>但我们一步步在靠近了
<20-11,BECKETT>But we're getting close.

648
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,880
<20-11,BECKETT>我们只需要每一步走得小心一点
<20-11,BECKETT>We just have to tread carefully.

650
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,560
<21-1,CASTLE>她在那
<21-1,CASTLE>There she is.

651
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:41,550
<21-1,CASTLE>她看上去很漂亮
<21-1,CASTLE>She looks nice.

652
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:47,510
<21-2,ALAN>这简直大错特错  我是安全检查员
<21-2,ALAN>This is a huge mistake. I'm a safety inspector.

653
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:49,320
<21-2,ALAN>这样一点都不性感
<21-2,ALAN>That's not even a little sexy.

654
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,520
<21-2,ALAN>比去死还吓人
<21-2,ALAN>This is so much scarier than dying.

655
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,010
<21-3,CASTLE>你是阿兰·马斯特斯  超级英雄
<21-3,CASTLE>You are Alan Masters, superhero.

656
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,980
<21-3,CASTLE>妞都喜欢超级英雄
<21-3,CASTLE>Chicks dig superheroes.

657
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:59,090
<21-4,ALAN>我要跟她说我是超级英雄吗
<21-4,ALAN>Should I tell her I'm a superhero?

658
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,650
<21-5,CASTLE>要是我  不会这么开场
<21-5,CASTLE>I wouldn't open with that.

659
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:01,970
<21-5,CASTLE>好吧
<21-5,CASTLE>Okay.

660
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,670
<21-6,ALAN>我要去了

661
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,730
<21-6,ALAN>祝我好运
<21-6,ALAN>Wish me luck.

662
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:05,720
<21-7,CASTLE>祝你好运

<21-12,ALAN>谢谢你能跟我一起吃饭
<21-12,ALAN>Thanks for having dinner with me.

668
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:18,030
<21-13,GWEN>经历了这样的一天  你打电话来我很惊讶
<21-13,GWEN>I was surprised that you called, after the day you've had.

669
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:19,800
<21-14,ALAN>今天真是够了  疯了
<21-14,ALAN>What a day, right? Crazy.

670
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,950
<21-14,ALAN>太疯狂了  我...

673
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,330
<21-16,ALAN>没什么  我打喷嚏而已
<21-16,ALAN>Nothing. I sneezed.

674
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:30,270
<21-17,GWEN>你...你打喷嚏会说"我是超级英雄"吗
<21-17,GWEN>You -- You sneezed, "I'm a superhero"?

675
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:31,610
<21-18,ALAN>对  对  过敏了
<21-18,ALAN>Yeah. Allergies.

676
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,400
<21-18,ALAN>超级英雄  不好意思
<21-18,ALAN>Superhero! Excuse me.

677
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:42,670
<21-19,CASTLE>莱恩
<21-19,CASTLE>Hey, Ryan.

678
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:44,590
<22-1,RYAN>我们查到了靶眼废物处理公司的所有者
<22-1,RYAN>We I.D.'d the owner of Bullseye Waste Management.

679
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,260
<22-1,RYAN>是一个叫霍雷肖·斯贝特的家伙
<22-1,RYAN>He's a guy named Horatio Spate.

680
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,680
<22-2,CASTLE>那就是个适合超级大反派的名字
<22-2,CASTLE>That's a good supervillain name.

681
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:48,450
<22-3,RYAN>没开玩笑
<22-3,RYAN>This is not a joke.

682
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:51,220
<22-3,RYAN>斯贝特涉嫌谋害了很多人
<22-3,RYAN>Spate is suspected of executing over a dozen people.

683
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:53,540
<22-3,RYAN>我把他的照片发给你了你留意一下
<22-3,RYAN>I texted you his picture just to put him on your radar.

684
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:54,940
<22-4,CASTLE>不管做什么  别出门
<22-4,CASTLE>Whatever you do, don't leave the loft.

685
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,700
<22-4,CASTLE>别出门  明白了
<22-4,CASTLE>Don't leave the loft. Got it.

686
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,470
<22-4,CASTLE>等等  那是什么声音
<22-4,CASTLE>Wait, what's that noise?

688
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:12,380
<23-1,SPATE>糟糕
<23-1,SPATE>Crap.

689
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,320
<23-2,ALAN>-你好阿兰  -我认识你吗
<23-2,ALAN>- Hello, Alan. - Do I know you?

690
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,350
<23-3,SPATE>抱歉打断你浪漫的晚餐
<23-3,SPATE>Sorry to interrupt your romantic dinner.

691
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:20,740
<23-4,CASTLE>小心阿兰  他就是你的死对头
<23-4,CASTLE>Careful, Alan. He's your archnemesis.

692
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,760
<23-5,ALAN>真的吗  我还有死对头
<23-5,ALAN>Seriously? I have an archnemesis?

693
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:25,980
<23-6,ALAN>他们就是这样装扮的吗
<23-6,ALAN>Is that how they dress?

694
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:28,090
<23-7,GWEN>阿兰你真可爱  我喜欢你
<23-7,GWEN>Alan, you're cute and I like you,

695
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:30,190
<23-7,GWEN>但这有点过了
<23-7,GWEN>but this is all a bit much.

696
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:34,490
<23-7,GWEN>你说你是超级英雄  他是大反派
<23-7,GWEN>You say that you're a superhero, and he's a supervillain.

697
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,780
<23-7,GWEN>所以你是他的跟班吗
<23-7,GWEN>So does that make you his sidekick?

698
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:39,720
<23-8,CASTLE>跟班  才不是  我是导师
<23-8,CASTLE>Sidekick? Please. I'm the mentor.

699
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,760
<23-9,GWEN>我还是他的约会对象呢
<23-9,GWEN>And I'm his date.

700
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,980
<23-9,GWEN>至少刚刚是
<23-9,GWEN>Or at least I was.

701
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:45,200
<23-9,GWEN>对不起  这太诡异了
<23-9,GWEN>I'm sorry. This is just weird.

702
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:48,660
<23-10,ALAN>她以为我是个疯子了  真谢谢你
<23-10,ALAN>And she thinks I'm crazy. Thank you so much.

703
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,000
<23-10,ALAN>都是你的错
<23-10,ALAN>This is all your fault.

704
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
<23-11,CASTLE>其实  是他的错
<23-11,CASTLE>Actually, it's his.

705
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,910
<23-11,CASTLE>阿兰  这位是霍雷肖·斯贝特
<23-11,CASTLE>Alan, meet Horatio Spate.

706
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:56,840
<23-11,CASTLE>他是靶眼废物处理公司的新掌门人
<23-11,CASTLE>He's the new owner of Bullseye Waste Management.

707
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,060
<23-12,ALAN>所以  你就是想要置我于死地的人吗
<23-12,ALAN>So, you're the one who's trying to kill me?

708
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:01,870
<23-13,SPATE>不  我若要你三更死  你岂能活到五更天
<23-13,SPATE>Hardly. If I wanted you dead, you'd be dead already.

709
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:03,970
<23-14,ALAN>那你想要什么
<23-14,ALAN>Well, what do you want?

710
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:05,260
<23-15,SPATE>一项互惠安排
<23-15,SPATE>An arrangement.

711
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,590
<23-15,SPATE>它对我们双方都有利
<23-15,SPATE>One that would benefit both of us.

712
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:09,550
<23-15,SPATE>有人两次试图杀死你
<23-15,SPATE>Twice someone's tried to kill you.

713
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:11,020
<23-15,SPATE>而你却能安然地活到现在
<23-15,SPATE>And you're still with us.

714
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,200
<23-15,SPATE>你认为你能幸运多久
<23-15,SPATE>How long before Lady Luck abandons you?

715
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,450
<23-16,CASTLE>让我猜猜
<23-16,CASTLE>Oh, let me guess.

716
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:16,840
<23-16,CASTLE>你可以为他提供保护
<23-16,CASTLE>A man like you can offer protection.

717
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,650
<23-17,SPATE>何止是保护  我能保证他的性命
<23-17,SPATE>More than offer. I can guarantee it.

718
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,050
<23-17,SPATE>作为条件  我希望你在实施安全检查时
<23-17,SPATE>In return, all I ask is that you adopt a more

719
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:26,140
<23-17,SPATE>能睁一只眼闭一只眼
<23-17,SPATE>laissez-faire interpretation of your inspection policies.

720
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:27,790
<23-18,CASTLE>这是道德考验
<23-18,CASTLE>This is a moral test.

721
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:31,410
<23-18,CASTLE>每个超级英雄都会被大反派逼入道德困境中
<23-18,CASTLE>Every superhero is presented with a moral dilemma by the villain,

722
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:32,830
<23-18,CASTLE>欲使其堕落
<23-18,CASTLE>trying to corrupt him.

723
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:36,580
<23-19,ALAN>霍雷肖·斯贝特  我的回答是不
<23-19,ALAN>Horatio Spate, my answer is no.

724
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:38,120
<23-20,CASTLE>他要拔枪
<23-20,CASTLE>Gun, gun.

725
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,820
<23-21,SPATE>放轻松  哥们
<23-21,SPATE>Relax, boys.

726
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,940
<23-21,SPATE>这是白果
<23-21,SPATE>It's ginkgo.

727
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:43,340
<23-21,SPATE>最近刚开始吃
<23-21,SPATE>Just started taking it.

728
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:44,530
<23-22,SPATE>它的作用是
<23-22,SPATE>Here's what it does.

729
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:47,570
<23-22,SPATE>提高记忆力  强化大脑功能
<23-22,SPATE>It improves memory, - it sharpens brain function,

730
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:51,730
<23-22,SPATE>促使人们作出最正确的决定
<23-22,SPATE>and it helps a person make really, really good decisions.

731
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,010
<23-22,SPATE>或许你该尝试一粒
<23-22,SPATE>Perhaps you should try one,

732
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,280
<23-22,SPATE>然后重新作出回答
<23-22,SPATE>then you can rethink your answer.

733
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,500
<23-23,SPATE>保重
<23-23,SPATE>Careful.

734
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:00,160
<23-23,SPATE>外面很危险哦
<23-23,SPATE>Dangerous out there.

735
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,280
<24-1,CASTLE>他活像是从漫画里走出来的人
<24-1,CASTLE>It's as if he stepped off the pages of a graphic novel.

736
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,230
<24-1,CASTLE>你们真该亲眼见见他的
<24-1,CASTLE>You should have been there to see him in person.

737
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:08,180
<24-2,BECKETT>对  他们应该亲眼见
<24-2,BECKETT>Yes. They should have.

738
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:10,100
<24-2,BECKETT>而不是你  也绝不是阿兰
<24-2,BECKETT>Not you, and definitely not Alan.

739
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,590
<24-2,BECKETT>我知道你心知肚明
<24-2,BECKETT>Now, tell me how dangerous it was for you

740
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:14,020
<24-2,BECKETT>把他带去公共场合是多么危险的事
<24-2,BECKETT>to take him out in public, 'cause I know that you knew.

741
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:17,420
<24-3,CASTLE>他坠入爱河了  贝克特  爱情至上
<24-3,CASTLE>He's in love, Beckett. And I love love.

742
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:20,280
<24-3,CASTLE>对不起  不会有下次了
<24-3,CASTLE>And I'm sorry, and I won't do it again.

743
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,950
<24-4,BECKETT>是的不会有下次了  你知道为什么吗
<24-4,BECKETT>No, you won't, and you know why?

744
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:23,640
<24-4,BECKETT>因为在找到霍雷肖之前
<24-4,BECKETT>Because I've had him sent to a real safe house

745
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,500
<24-4,BECKETT>他会一直待在我安排的安全房里
<24-4,BECKETT>until we track down Horatio.

746
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,860
<24-5,RYAN>头儿  我们认为他们可能想要低调
<24-5,RYAN>Boss, I know we were talking about flying under the radar,

747
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:30,190
<24-5,RYAN>但这事一点都不像是霍雷肖的风格
<24-5,RYAN>but that really doesn't seem to be Horatio's style.

748
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:31,620
<24-5,RYAN>他是用子弹来解决问题的人
<24-5,RYAN>I mean, he solves problems with bullets,

749
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:34,970
<24-5,RYAN>而不是什么下毒  或精心计划的电击圈套
<24-5,RYAN>not poisons and elaborate electrocution traps.

750
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:36,840
<24-6,ESPOSITO>那他为什么要担保阿兰性命
<24-6,ESPOSITO>So why would he guarantee protection?

751
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:40,010
<24-7,CASTLE>可能他知道谁是真正的凶手
<24-7,CASTLE>Oh, maybe he knows the actual identity of our would-be killer.

752
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:43,320
<24-8,BECKETT>阻止凶手的罪行能让他控制阿兰
<24-8,BECKETT>And stopping the hit could benefit his waste-disposal company

753
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,370
<24-8,BECKETT>进而惠及他的废物处理公司
<24-8,BECKETT>by giving him leverage on Alan.

754
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,460
<24-8,BECKETT>霍雷肖有没有什么熟人最近买了TTX
<24-8,BECKETT>Are any of Horatio's associates recent buyers of TTX?

755
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,430
<24-8,BECKETT>这能帮我们缩小想杀阿兰的嫌疑人范围
<24-8,BECKETT>'Cause that could help us narrow down who's trying to kill Alan.

756
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:52,510
<24-9,RYAN>清单在这里
<24-9,RYAN>We've got the list right here.

757
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,570
<24-10,CASTLE>等等  福龙药草公司
<24-10,CASTLE>Wait a minute. Lucky Dragon Herbologists?

759
00:26:56,570 --> 00:27:00,290
<24-10,CASTLE>霍雷肖有个小药盒  上面有龙的标识
<24-10,CASTLE>Horatio had a pillbox with a dragon logo on it.

760
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,900
<24-11,CASTLE>就是它  一样的标识
<24-11,CASTLE>That's it. That's the same logo.

761
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:09,770
<24-12,ESPOSITO>这上面说那是中国白莲教的幌子公司
<24-12,ESPOSITO>It says here that it's a front for the White Lotus Chinese Triad.

762
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:11,610
<24-13,RYAN>这么一家国际知名黑帮持有TTX
<24-13,RYAN>Okay, so how does an international gang

763
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:13,600
<24-13,RYAN>是如何做到不被调查的呢
<24-13,RYAN>get cleared to possess TTX?

764
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,640
<24-14,BECKETT>福龙是一家合法经营的企业
<24-14,BECKETT>Because Lucky Dragon is a legitimate business

765
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:18,790
<24-14,BECKETT>而且中医里有小剂量的TTX是正常的
<24-14,BECKETT>and there are small doses of TTX in Eastern medicine.

766
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:20,460
<24-15,ESPOSITO>等等  这说不通啊
<24-15,ESPOSITO>Hold up. This doesn't make sense.

767
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,850
<24-15,ESPOSITO>有情报说
<24-15,ESPOSITO>According to Intel,

768
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:25,070
<24-15,ESPOSITO>白莲教把霍雷肖视为眼中钉
<24-15,ESPOSITO>the Triad sees Horatio as a threat to their territory.

769
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:26,350
<24-15,ESPOSITO>他们之间随时会有一场血战
<24-15,ESPOSITO>They're gearing up for war.

770
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:29,240
<24-16,RYAN>所以霍雷肖无法保证阿兰
<24-16,RYAN>So, no way is Horatio guaranteeing Alan's safety

771
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,290
<24-16,RYAN>不死于白莲教之手
<24-16,RYAN>with the Triads.

772
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:31,450
<24-16,RYAN>除非
<24-16,RYAN>Unless...

773
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,960
<24-17,CASTLE>霍雷肖说他最近开始吃白果
<24-17,CASTLE>Horatio said he just started taking ginkgo.

774
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,640
<24-17,CASTLE>有没有可能这两大集团正在协商
<24-17,CASTLE>What if the two empires are hammering out

775
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,660
<24-17,CASTLE>达成某种联盟
<24-17,CASTLE>some kind of an alliance?

776
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:39,870
<24-18,ESPOSITO>阿兰不明就里地牵扯进这个联盟
<24-18,ESPOSITO>An alliance that Alan unknowingly stumbled onto

777
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:41,720
<24-18,ESPOSITO>成为白莲教的瓮中之鳖
<24-18,ESPOSITO>and put him right in the cross hairs of the Triad.

778
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,750
<24-19,RYAN>不过到底是什么让水火不容的黑帮
<24-19,RYAN>But what could bring two warring gangs together

779
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:44,960
<24-19,RYAN>合作了呢
<24-19,RYAN>to join forces?

780
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,150
<24-20,BECKETT>去弄一张福龙药草公司的搜查令
<24-20,BECKETT>Well, get a search warrant for Lucky Dragon Herbologists

781
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:48,310
<24-20,BECKETT>来查个水落石出
<24-20,BECKETT>and find out.

782
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:52,650
<24-22,BECKETT>卡莱布
<24-22,BECKETT>Uh, Caleb.

783
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:53,250
<24-22,BECKETT>你怎么来这了
<24-22,BECKETT>What are you doing here?

784
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:54,070
<24-23,CALEB>不好意思打扰你了
<24-23,CALEB>I hate to bother you,

785
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:55,640
<24-23,CALEB>但我有个客户亟须你的帮助
<24-23,CALEB>but I could really use your help with a client.

786
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,410
<24-23,CALEB>你能过来几分钟吗
<24-23,CALEB>Can I borrow you for a quick minute?

787
00:27:57,690 --> 00:27:58,820
<24-24,BECKETT>当然可以
<24-24,BECKETT>Yeah, sure.

788
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,250
<25-1,BECKETT>这个客户是谁
<25-1,BECKETT>So, who is this client?

789
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,890
<25-2,CALEB>我想你应该对他很熟
<25-2,CALEB>I think you're familiar with him --

790
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:06,970
<25-2,CALEB>彼得·麦克加菲
<25-2,CALEB>Peter McCaffery.

791
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,060
<25-3,BECKETT>不  没听过
<25-3,BECKETT>No, it -- it doesn't sound familiar.

792
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:13,210
<25-4,CALEB>没听过  我帮你回忆一下
<25-4,CALEB>No? Let me fill you in.

793
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:15,590
<25-4,CALEB>有个十分热血的警察
<25-4,CALEB>So, there's this overzealous cop.

794
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:17,670
<25-4,CALEB>你了解这种类型的  她永不言弃
<25-4,CALEB>You know the type. She never knows when to give up.

795
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:19,310
<25-4,CALEB>她让她的技术人员
<25-4,CALEB>And she has her tech guy

796
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:21,860
<25-4,CALEB>调查了彼得·麦克加菲最近的行程
<25-4,CALEB>look into Peter McCaffery's recent travel.

797
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,170
<25-5,BECKETT>好吧
<25-5,BECKETT>Okay.

798
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:26,050
<25-6,CALEB>麦克加菲先生是个十分注重隐私的人
<25-6,CALEB>Yeah, well, Mr. McCaffery's a very private person,

799
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:29,310
<25-6,CALEB>他设置了一些让人意想不到的数字绊雷
<25-6,CALEB>so he set up some unexpected digital trip wires.

800
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:32,160
<25-6,CALEB>这对技术人员和他老板来说可不是件好事
<25-6,CALEB>That's bad news for the tech guy and his boss.

801
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:35,860
<25-6,CALEB>而这位警察仍在浑然不知地迈入绝境
<25-6,CALEB>And so this cop, she keeps marching toward this kill zone,

802
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,650
<25-6,CALEB>除非她回头
<25-6,CALEB>and unless she makes an about-face,

803
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:39,720
<25-6,CALEB>否则她绝不会有好下场
<25-6,CALEB>it is not going to end well.

804
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:42,810
<25-7,BECKETT>我不明白
<25-7,BECKETT>I don't get it.

805
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,190
<25-7,BECKETT>你曾为和平部队服役一整期
<25-7,BECKETT>You served a full term in the Peace Corps.

806
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:46,960
<25-7,BECKETT>你在环保局工作过
<25-7,BECKETT>You worked for the EPA.

807
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:49,760
<25-7,BECKETT>你用法律武器和贪污受贿的公司作斗争
<25-7,BECKETT>You brought legal action against corrupt corporations.

808
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:50,930
<25-8,CALEB>你想说什么  凯特
<25-8,CALEB>What's your point, Kate?

809
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:51,750
<25-8,CALEB>究竟发生了什么
<25-8,CALEB>What happened?

810
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:53,940
<25-9,BECKETT>你曾经正义有为  为什么失去了初心
<25-9,BECKETT>You used to make a difference. Why did you sell out?

811
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:56,890
<25-9,BECKETT>听着
<25-9,BECKETT>Look.

812
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:01,430
<25-10,CALEB>我的客户是迫不得已才为他斗不过的人效力的
<25-10,CALEB>My client is forced to work for a man that he cannot fight.

813
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:04,600
<25-10,CALEB>信我的话吧  你也斗不过的
<25-10,CALEB>And take my word for it. Neither can you.

814
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,500
<25-11,BECKETT>我们互相帮助吧
<25-11,BECKETT>Let's help each other out here.

815
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:09,010
<25-11,BECKETT>我们可以扳倒洛克塞特
<25-11,BECKETT>We can bring down LokSat.

816
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:12,180
<25-11,BECKETT>我这是再给你一个弃恶扬善的机会
<25-11,BECKETT>I'm giving you a second chance to make a difference.

817
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,350
<25-12,CALEB>警监  别太为难自己
<25-12,CALEB>Captain, just do yourself a favor, hmm?

818
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,700
<25-12,CALEB>听从我的警告吧
<25-12,CALEB>Heed my warning.

819
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:21,020
<25-13,BECKETT>不  还是你听我的警告吧
<25-13,BECKETT>No, you heed mine.

820
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,790
<25-13,BECKETT>你可以考虑到明晚八点
<25-13,BECKETT>You have until 8:00 tomorrow night.

821
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:25,310
<25-14,CALEB>不然怎么样呢
<25-14,CALEB>Then what?

822
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:26,950
<25-15,BECKETT>不然我就揭发你
<25-15,BECKETT>I'll expose you.

823
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:29,590
<25-15,BECKETT>我们就一起担惊受怕
<25-15,BECKETT>And then we'll both be looking over our shoulders,

824
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:32,140
<25-15,BECKETT>等着洛克塞特把我们灭口
<25-15,BECKETT>waiting for LokSat to tie up loose ends.

825
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,410
<25-15,BECKETT>因为他们一旦发现你的伪装身份暴露了
<25-15,BECKETT>Because once they find out that your cover is blown

826
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:35,700
<25-15,BECKETT>我盯上你了
<25-15,BECKETT>and I'm onto you,

827
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:37,380
<25-15,BECKETT>那你和我一样得死
<25-15,BECKETT>then you're gonna be as dead as I am.

828
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,640
<25-16,CALEB>七分钟  凯特
<25-16,CALEB>Seven minutes, Kate.

829
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:40,800
<25-16,CALEB>七分钟
<25-16,CALEB>Seven minutes.

830
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,770
<25-16,CALEB>身体死亡后
<25-16,CALEB>That's how long the brain continues to function

831
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:44,010
<25-16,CALEB>大脑还会运行七分钟时间
<25-16,CALEB>after the body dies,

832
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:47,680
<25-16,CALEB>神经突触慢慢熄灭之际
<25-16,CALEB>and as all of those synapses slowly stop firing off,

833
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,950
<25-16,CALEB>就是人们常说的走马灯  一生的经历在眼前闪过
<25-16,CALEB>that's when they say that our lives flash before our eyes.

834
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:51,740
<25-16,CALEB>等你的七分钟来临的时候
<25-16,CALEB>Now, when your seven minutes come,

835
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:55,370
<25-16,CALEB>我真心希望你的眼前不会浮现这个瞬间
<25-16,CALEB>I sincerely hope that you do not flash to this moment,

836
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:58,810
<25-16,CALEB>你有机会选择生却偏要选择死的瞬间
<25-16,CALEB>when you had a chance to live and you chose not to.

837
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:09,100
<26-1,BECKETT>需要我来处理吗
<26-1,BECKETT>Do you want me to handle that?

838
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,950
<26-1,BECKETT>你今天早上紧张得要命
<26-1,BECKETT>You're on edge this morning.

839
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:13,160
<26-2,CASTLE>紧张  我为什么要紧张
<26-2,CASTLE>On edge? Why would I be on edge?

840
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:15,600
<26-2,CASTLE>是因为洛克塞特的亲信知道我们盯上他了
<26-2,CASTLE>Because LokSat's henchman knows we're onto him

841
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,550
<26-2,CASTLE>刺客随时可能破门而入吗
<26-2,CASTLE>and assassins could come through the door at any second.

842
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:19,420
<26-2,CASTLE>我倒想问  你为什么不紧张
<26-2,CASTLE>I mean, why aren't you on edge?

843
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,410
<26-3,BECKETT>卡莱布有很多面  但是他不会自取灭亡
<26-3,BECKETT>well, Caleb is a lot of things, but he's not suicidal,

844
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:24,100
<26-3,BECKETT>他只能找我们帮忙
<26-3,BECKETT>and working with us is his only recourse.

845
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,550
<26-4,CASTLE>他威胁你的性命
<26-4,CASTLE>He threatened your life.

846
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:26,660
<26-5,BECKETT>因为他害怕了
<26-5,BECKETT>Because he was scared.

847
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,290
<26-5,BECKETT>相信我  卡塞尔  我把他说动了
<26-5,BECKETT>Trust me, Castle. I turned him.

848
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:30,090
<26-5,BECKETT>我确定他今天会来
<26-5,BECKETT>I'm positive he's gonna come in today.

849
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:31,500
<26-6,CASTLE>我也觉得他会来
<26-6,CASTLE>Oh, yeah, I think he's coming in, too.

850
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,680
<26-6,CASTLE>反正他不来就是洛克塞特的杀人小分队来
<26-6,CASTLE>Well, either him or LokSat's kill squads.

851
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:34,790
<26-8,CASTLE>天啊
<26-8,CASTLE>Geez.

852
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,140
<26-9,RYAN>科博法官拒绝签署我们对
<26-9,RYAN>So, Judge Kober just denied our search warrant request

853
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,580
<26-9,RYAN>福龙药草公司的搜查令申请
<26-9,RYAN>for The Lucky Dragon.

854
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,120
<26-10,BECKETT>我们怀疑那是白莲教的幌子
<26-10,BECKETT>A suspected Triad front.

855
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,140
<26-10,BECKETT>她知道两次刺杀阿兰未遂都和他们有联系吗
<26-10,BECKETT>Does she know that we like them for two attempts on Alan's life?

856
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,840
<26-11,RYAN>她说我们还需要合理依据
<26-11,RYAN>Says we still need probable cause.

857
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:48,540
<26-12,BECKETT>我们只能另辟蹊径了
<26-12,BECKETT>Okay, we got to go at this a different way.

858
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,180
<26-12,BECKETT>如果霍雷肖和白莲教
<26-12,BECKETT>You know, if Horatio and the Triads

859
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:52,210
<26-12,BECKETT>真的联手的话  那一定是大事
<26-12,BECKETT>are working together, this is something big.

860
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:53,520
<26-12,BECKETT>各位
<26-12,BECKETT>Guys.

861
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:55,670
<26-13,CASTLE>我知道该怎么进去了
<26-13,CASTLE>I know how to get in.

862
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,490
<27-1,CASTLE>一定要按计划行事
<27-1,CASTLE>Stick to the plan.

863
00:30:57,490 --> 00:30:59,810
<27-2,ALAN>放松点  我完全能搞定
<27-2,ALAN>Relax. I totally got this.

864
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:03,440
<27-3,SHOP MAN>欢迎光临福龙药草公司
<27-3,SHOP MAN>Welcome to Lucky Dragon Herbs and Remedies.

865
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,720
<27-3,SHOP MAN>你们想要点什么
<27-3,SHOP MAN>Can I help you?

866
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,430
<27-4,ALAN>安检抽查
<27-4,ALAN>Surprise safety inspection.

867
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:11,810
<27-5,CASTLE>顺便提醒您  先生  他举着证件呢
<27-5,CASTLE>FYI, sir, he's holding out a badge

868
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:13,940
<27-5,CASTLE>上面写着安全健康部
<27-5,CASTLE>that says - Department of Safety and Health

869
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,840
<27-5,CASTLE>他的表情很严肃
<27-5,CASTLE>and he's got a serious look on his face.

870
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,590
<27-6,ALAN>非常严肃
<27-6,ALAN>Very serious look.

871
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:20,970
<27-7,MAN>好吧  但是为什么两个人一起来检查
<27-7,MAN>Okay. But why two inspectors?

872
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:25,140
<27-8,ALAN>-因为他是我带的实习生  -我是实习生
<27-8,ALAN>- Uh, because he is my trainee... - Trainee.

873
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:27,890
<27-10,ALAN>多一双眼睛盯着有好处
<27-10,ALAN>...and it helps to have a second set of eyes.

874
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:30,370
<27-11,ALAN>不是说只有一双眼睛
<27-11,ALAN>Not that one set of eyes

875
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:32,850
<27-11,ALAN>或者没有眼睛就不好
<27-11,ALAN>or no sets of eyes is a bad thing.

876
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:34,820
<27-12,MAN>你们爱带几双眼睛都行
<27-12,MAN>Bring all the eyes you would like.

877
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:36,710
<27-12,MAN>我敢说你们查不出我的药
<27-12,MAN>I'm sure you'll find my medicines

878
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:39,480
<27-12,MAN>违反你们西方的什么规矩
<27-12,MAN>violate none of your Western laws.

879
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,650
<27-13,CASTLE>这事我们自有判断
<27-13,CASTLE>We'll be the judge of that.

880
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,270
<27-14,MAN>我觉得我应该和你们在一起
<27-14,MAN>I ask we stay together

881
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:51,070
<27-14,MAN>这样才能给你们答疑解惑
<27-14,MAN>so I may address your inspection concerns.

882
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:51,880
<27-14,MAN>当然了
<27-14,MAN>Of course.

883
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:56,640
<27-15,CASTLE>我来引开他  你溜到里屋去
<27-15,CASTLE>I'll cause a distraction. You slip to the back room.

884
00:31:57,170 --> 00:31:59,970
<27-16,MAN>这些是我最名贵的草药
<27-16,MAN>Here are some of my most precious herbs.

885
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:02,160
<27-16,MAN>这个国家长不出来的
<27-16,MAN>Impossible to grow in this country.

886
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,990
<27-17,CASTLE>你是说这边的草药吗
<27-17,CASTLE>Oh, you mean these herbs right here?

887
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,230
<27-18,MAN>你的助手笨手笨脚
<27-18,MAN>Your assistant's very clumsy.

888
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:14,640
<27-19,ALAN>是啊  他就这样
<27-19,ALAN>Yes, he is.

889
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,360
<27-19,ALAN>所以我们越早查完走人越好
<27-19,ALAN>Which is why the sooner we get out of your way, the better.

890
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,490
<27-19,ALAN>麻烦带我们去里屋看看
<27-19,ALAN>Take us to your back room now, please.

891
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:20,690
<27-20,MAN>那是当然
<27-20,MAN>But of course.

892
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:24,980
<27-21,MAN>等等  我感受到一股力量
<27-21,MAN>Wait. I sense something.

893
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:26,990
<27-21,MAN>一股强大的力量
<27-21,MAN>Something powerful.

894
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:30,190
<27-21,MAN>这是超越自然规律的存在
<27-21,MAN>An unnatural presence in the order of things.

895
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:30,990
<27-22,CASTLE>哪种存在
<27-22,CASTLE>What kind of presence?

896
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,080
<27-22,CASTLE>到底是哪种存在呢
<27-22,CASTLE>What kind, indeed?

897
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,790
<27-23,MAN>当凡人不再是凡人
<27-23,MAN>When is a man not a man?

898
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:36,580
<27-23,MAN>当生命之力无法断绝
<27-23,MAN>When his life-force cannot be extinguished,

899
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,150
<27-23,MAN>当他拥有不死之身的时候
<27-23,MAN>when he cannot die.

900
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:40,680
<27-23,MAN>那他就是神
<27-23,MAN>Then he is a god.

901
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:42,290
<27-24,CASTLE>我觉得他感受到你的力量了
<27-24,CASTLE>I think he senses your powers.

902
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,160
<27-25,ALAN>真的吗  你这么觉得吗
<27-25,ALAN>Yeah? You do?

903
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,260
<27-26,CASTLE>要不然就是他在拖延时间
<27-26,CASTLE>Either that or he's buying time

904
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:46,400
<27-26,CASTLE>让他的同伙把违禁品从后门运出去
<27-26,CASTLE>while his guys get the contraband out the back door.

905
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,080
<28-1,ESPOSITO>你们把箱子放下
<28-1,ESPOSITO>You guys drop the cases.

906
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,830
<28-2,RYAN>纽约警局  跪下  伙计们
<28-2,RYAN>NYPD. On your knees, fellas.

907
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:05,200
<28-3,ESPOSITO>这到底是什么
<28-3,ESPOSITO>What the hell is this?

908
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:06,290
<29-1,LANIE>海洛因
<29-1,LANIE>Heroin.

909
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:08,060
<29-2,CASTLE>什么时候开始海洛因长这样了
<29-2,CASTLE>Since when does heroin look like that?

910
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,950
<29-3,LANIE>从进化成合成海洛因开始
<29-3,LANIE>Since it's synthetic heroin,

911
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:12,960
<29-3,LANIE>这是一种批量生产模拟海洛因毒瘾的类鸦片
<29-3,LANIE>an opioid manufactured to replicate a heroin high.

912
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,360
<29-3,LANIE>实际上  这东西是升级版
<29-3,LANIE>In fact, this stuff actually improves on it

913
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,470
<29-3,LANIE>因为根据我的测试分析
<29-3,LANIE>because, according to the analysis I ran,

914
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:18,910
<29-3,LANIE>它掺了河鲀毒素
<29-3,LANIE>it's laced with TTX.

915
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:21,210
<29-4,ALAN>就是那种差点杀了我的毒药
<29-4,ALAN>The same poison that almost killed me?

916
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:23,090
<29-4,ALAN>怎么  海洛因还不够危险吗
<29-4,ALAN>What, heroin isn't dangerous enough?

917
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:26,360
<29-5,LANIE>因为这宗毒药能够戒断神经元突触
<29-5,LANIE>Because that poison works by blocking synapses.

918
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,530
<29-5,LANIE>小剂量下  它是有效的止痛剂
<29-5,LANIE>In small doses, it's a powerful analgesic

919
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:31,770
<29-5,LANIE>尤其是消除吸食海洛因的疼痛
<29-5,LANIE>specifically used for the pain of heroin withdrawal.

920
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:33,730
<29-6,BECKETT>所以它通过减轻疼痛副作用
<29-6,BECKETT>So it makes the drug more addictive

921
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:35,300
<29-6,BECKETT>让毒品更容易使人上瘾
<29-6,BECKETT>by reducing the painful side effects.

922
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,630
<29-6,BECKETT>就此  海洛因
<29-6,BECKETT>So more addictive heroin

923
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:38,670
<29-6,BECKETT>不再需要通过走私
<29-6,BECKETT>that doesn't have to be smuggled into the country because --

924
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:41,110
<29-7,CASTLE>因为它在美国就能制造
<29-7,CASTLE>Because it can be made right here in the good old U.S. Of A.

925
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:42,850
<29-8,BECKETT>这也解释了白莲教和霍雷肖
<29-8,BECKETT>That explains why the Triads and Horatio

926
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:44,710
<29-8,BECKETT>为什么愿意搁置争议
<29-8,BECKETT>are willing to put their difference aside,

927
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:45,790
<29-8,BECKETT>因为合成海洛因能值几十亿
<29-8,BECKETT>because synthetic heroin could be worth billions.

928
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:47,280
<29-9,ALAN>合成海洛因能值几十亿
<29-9,ALAN>Synthetic heroin could be worth billions.

929
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,630
<29-9,ALAN>这和我有什么关系
<29-9,ALAN>What does this have to do with me?

930
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,440
<29-9,ALAN>为什么有人想要我死
<29-9,ALAN>Why would anybody want me dead?

931
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,910
<29-10,LANIE>显然  这东西是在某个实验室里制作的
<29-10,LANIE>Well, clearly this stuff is made in a lab somewhere,

932
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:55,130
<29-10,LANIE>而你的工作室检查实验室  所以
<29-10,LANIE>and your job is to inspect laboratories, so --

933
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:58,460
<29-11,ALAN>你知道  这种黄色看上去很眼熟
<29-11,ALAN>You know, this shade of yellow looks very familiar.

934
00:33:58,460 --> 00:33:59,690
<29-11,ALAN>它怎么会是这种颜色
<29-11,ALAN>What is it that gives it this color?

935
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:03,230
<29-12,LANIE>叫做L.A.H的无机催化剂
<29-12,LANIE>An inorganic catalyst commonly referred to as L.A.H.

936
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:05,400
<29-13,ALAN>氢化锂铝
<29-13,ALAN>Lithium aluminum hydride?

937
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:07,210
<29-13,ALAN>我在检查赞提姆实验室时
<29-13,ALAN>That is the same chemical that spilled

938
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:09,920
<29-13,ALAN>泄露的就是这种化学物质
<29-13,ALAN>when I was inspecting Zantium Labs.

939
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:12,490
<29-14,LANIE>所以他们想要你死
<29-14,LANIE>This is why they wanted you dead.

940
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:15,040
<29-15,ALAN>当合成海洛因上市的时候
<29-15,ALAN>When the synthetic heroin hits the streets,

941
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,150
<29-15,ALAN>大家都会知道它通过L.A.H合成
<29-15,ALAN>it'll come out that it was made with L.A.H.

942
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:19,630
<29-16,LANIE>而既然你知道哪个实验室买了大量的L.A.H
<29-16,LANIE>And since you knew the lab had purchased large amounts of L.A.H.

943
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:21,090
<29-17,ALAN>他们不敢冒着
<29-17,ALAN>They couldn't take the risk

944
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:22,610
<29-17,ALAN>我可能在新闻上看见什么
<29-17,ALAN>that I might see something on the news,

945
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:23,570
<29-17,ALAN>把线索拼凑在一起
<29-17,ALAN>put the pieces together,

946
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:25,500
<29-17,ALAN>-向政府举报的风险  -意味着
<29-17,ALAN>- and report it to the authorities. - Which means...

947
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,610
<29-19,ALAN>赞提姆实验室的人想要杀我
<29-19,ALAN>Someone at Zantium Labs is trying to kill me!

948
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:28,360
<29-20,LANIE>赞提姆实验室的人想要杀你
<29-20,LANIE>...someone at Zantium Labs is trying to kill you!

949
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,290
<29-21,BECKETT>天啊  我们说话听起来也是这样的吗
<29-21,BECKETT>Oh, my God. Is that what we sound like?

950
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:31,310
<29-22,CASTLE>希望不是
<29-22,CASTLE>Certainly hope not.

951
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,660
<29-22,CASTLE>这很可爱  但有点太可爱了
<29-22,CASTLE>I mean, it was cute but just overly cute.

952
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:34,380
<29-23,BECKETT>阿兰
<29-23,BECKETT>Alan.

953
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:37,020
<29-25,BECKETT>你知道赞提姆实验室是谁订购了L.A.H吗
<29-25,BECKETT>Do you know who ordered the L.A.H. For Zantium?

954
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:39,700
<29-26,ALAN>我知道  麦克·林  首席化学家
<29-26,ALAN>I do. Mike Lin, the lead chemist.

955
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:41,530
<29-26,ALAN>我记得在订购单上看到了他的名字
<29-26,ALAN>I remember seeing his name on the purchase order.

956
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:43,300
<29-26,ALAN>也许他就是想要杀我的人
<29-26,ALAN>He's probably the guy who's trying to kill me.

957
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,300
<29-26,ALAN>他可能非常危险
<29-26,ALAN>He could be very dangerous.

958
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:46,140
<29-26,ALAN>我们得在他伤害别人之前
<29-26,ALAN>We need to get down there and figure something out

959
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:47,040
<29-26,ALAN>想办法搞定他
<29-26,ALAN>before he hurts someone else.

960
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,480
<29-27,BECKETT>不  我们得很谨慎
<29-27,BECKETT>No. We have to be very smart about this.

961
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,640
<29-27,BECKETT>麦克这样的化学家
<29-27,BECKETT>There is no way that Mike, a chemist,

962
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:52,970
<29-27,BECKETT>不可能是他一个人行动
<29-27,BECKETT>would be working alone here,

963
00:34:52,970 --> 00:34:57,070
<29-27,BECKETT>所以我们得先得到扣押整个实验室的法院指令
<29-27,BECKETT>so we have to get a court order to impound the entire laboratory

964
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:59,290
<29-27,BECKETT>确保每人毁坏任何证物
<29-27,BECKETT>and make sure that nobody destroys any of the evidence.

965
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:00,760
<29-28,ALAN>需要花多久时间
<29-28,ALAN>Well, how long will that take?

966
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,780
<29-29,BECKETT>别担心  我们会抓到他的
<29-29,BECKETT>Don't worry. We'll get this guy.

967
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,140
<30-1,RYAN>卡塞尔  你在这啊
<30-1,RYAN>Oh, Castle. There you are.

968
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,250
<30-1,RYAN>我们拿到搜查令了  走吧
<30-1,RYAN>We got the warrant. Let's go.

969
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:09,630
<30-2,ESPOSITO>好  阿兰在哪
<30-2,ESPOSITO>Yeah. Where's Alan?

970
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,040
<30-3,CASTLE>我以为他跟你们在一起
<30-3,CASTLE>I thought he was with you guys.

971
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:14,140
<30-3,CASTLE>哦  不
<30-3,CASTLE>Oh, no.

972
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:24,300
<31-1,ALAN>格温
<31-1,ALAN>Gwen!

973
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,680
<31-2,GWEN>阿兰  你在这干什么
<31-2,GWEN>Alan. What are you doing here?

974
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,420
<31-3,ALAN>如果你想活命的话就跟我来
<31-3,ALAN>Come with me if you want to live.

975
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,660
<31-4,GWEN>阿兰  发生什么了
<31-4,GWEN>Alan, what is going on?

976
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:40,220
<31-5,ALAN>麦克·林在实验室里秘密的制作合成海洛因
<31-5,ALAN>Mike Lin is secretly making synthetic heroin in the lab.

977
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:41,810
<31-5,ALAN>就是他想要杀我
<31-5,ALAN>He's the one who's trying to kill me.

978
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:43,760
<31-6,GWEN>天啊  阿兰  你确定吗
<31-6,GWEN>Oh, my God. Alan, are you sure?

979
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,180
<31-7,ALAN>是啊  但别担心
<31-7,ALAN>Yeah. But don't worry.

980
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:46,430
<31-7,ALAN>警察马上就过来
<31-7,ALAN>The cops are on the way,

981
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:48,770
<31-7,ALAN>在那之前  我会保护你
<31-7,ALAN>and until then, I'll protect you.

982
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:52,090
<31-8,ALAN>这个能用
<31-8,ALAN>This'll work.

983
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:55,180
<31-8,ALAN>如果那个老瞎子能用  我也能用
<31-8,ALAN>Yeah, if that old blind guy could use it, so could I.

984
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,810
<31-9,ALAN>或者  那个其实更好
<31-9,ALAN>Or -- Or that's actually better.

985
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:01,790
<31-9,ALAN>等等  你为什么有枪
<31-9,ALAN>Wait. Why do you have a gun?

986
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,380
<31-10,GWEN>-我要杀了麦克  -不
<31-10,GWEN>- I'm gonna kill Mike. - No.

987
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:05,420
<31-11,ALAN>不  不  警察会逮捕他的
<31-11,ALAN>No, no, no. The cops will arrest him.

988
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:06,670
<31-12,GWEN>这就是我害怕的
<31-12,GWEN>That's what I'm afraid of.

989
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:07,530
<31-12,GWEN>麦克是这唯一
<31-12,GWEN>Mike is the only person here

990
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:09,690
<31-12,GWEN>知道我在掌控毒品生意的人
<31-12,GWEN>who knows that I'm running this drug operation.

991
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:11,230
<31-12,GWEN>什么
<31-12,GWEN>What?

992
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,940
<31-13,ALAN>等等  是你给我下毒的
<31-13,ALAN>Wait, you're the one who poisoned me?

993
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,780
<31-14,GWEN>还有要电死你  是的
<31-14,GWEN>And electrocuted you, yeah.

994
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:18,510
<31-14,GWEN>我在试图保持低调
<31-14,GWEN>I was trying to be discreet.

995
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:19,350
<31-14,GWEN>我男朋友霍雷肖说
<31-14,GWEN>I mean, my boyfriend Horatio

996
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:21,050
<31-14,GWEN>我应该直接朝你脑袋上开一枪  但
<31-14,GWEN>said I should just shoot you in the head, but --

997
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:22,980
<31-15,ALAN>等等  别说了
<31-15,ALAN>Hold on! Stop everything!

998
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:23,740
<31-15,ALAN>哇
<31-15,ALAN>Wha--

999
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:26,180
<31-15,ALAN>霍雷肖是你男朋友
<31-15,ALAN>Horatio is your boyfriend?

1000
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:30,650
<31-15,ALAN>所以  我猜第二次约会是没戏了
<31-15,ALAN>So I guess a second date is out of the question?

1001
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:31,940
<31-15,ALAN>阿兰
<31-15,ALAN>Alan.

1002
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:34,980
<31-16,GWEN>你真的觉得像你这样的人跟我有戏吗
<31-16,GWEN>You seriously thought a guy like you had a shot with me?

1003
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,470
<31-17,ALAN>我还认为濒死两次很痛苦
<31-17,ALAN>I thought dying twice was painful.

1004
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:41,030
<31-18,GWEN>也许第三次不会有这么难受了
<31-18,GWEN>Well, maybe it won't be so bad the third time.

1005
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:46,020
<32-1,POLICE>-警察  -都别动  纽约警察
<32-1,POLICE>- Police! - Nobody move! NYPD!

1006
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:48,190
<32-1,POLICE>马上  举起手来
<32-1,POLICE>Right now! Put up your hands!

1007
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:49,950
<32-2,RYAN>-举起手来  -把你的手放在我们视线内
<32-2,RYAN>- Get 'em up! - Get your hands where we can see 'em!

1008
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:51,940
<32-2,RYAN>手  手
<32-2,RYAN>Hands. Hands.

1009
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:57,220
<32-3,CASTLE>看到阿兰了吗
<32-3,CASTLE>Any sign of Alan?

1010
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,130
<32-4,RYAN>不  还没有
<32-4,RYAN>No, not yet.

1011
00:36:58,130 --> 00:36:59,380
<32-5,CASTLE>我确定他到这来了
<32-5,CASTLE>I'm sure he came here.

1012
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,350
<32-5,CASTLE>看看你能找到格温的办公室吗
<32-5,CASTLE>See if you can find Gwen's office.

1013
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:14,290
<32-6,CASTLE>阿兰
<32-6,CASTLE>Alan!

1014
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,210
<32-7,RYAN>哦  不
<32-7,RYAN>Oh, no.

1015
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,200
<32-8,CASTLE>这是我的错误
<32-8,CASTLE>This is my fault.

1016
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:33,980
<32-8,CASTLE>我在他身上强加了超级英雄的责任
<32-8,CASTLE>I forced the superhero mantle onto him.

1017
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:37,080
<32-8,CASTLE>我向他灌输了他是刀枪不入的这种疯狂的念头
<32-8,CASTLE>I filled his head with crazy ideas of being invulnerable,

1018
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,670
<32-8,CASTLE>然后就像伊卡洛斯一样
<32-8,CASTLE>and then, like some superhero Icarus,

1019
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:41,320
<32-8,CASTLE>他飞得离太阳太近了
<32-8,CASTLE>he flew too close to the sun.

1020
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:44,200
<32-8,CASTLE>阿兰  对不起  我很抱歉
<32-8,CASTLE>Alan, I'm sorry. I am so sorry.

1021
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,340
<32-8,CASTLE>我让你失望了
<32-8,CASTLE>I let you down!

1022
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:47,240
<32-9,CASTLE>谢谢
<32-9,CASTLE>Thank you.

1023
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:47,990
<32-10,ALAN>没关系
<32-10,ALAN>Don't mention it.

1024
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:49,610
<32-11,CASTLE>阿兰  你还活着
<32-11,CASTLE>Alan! You're alive?

1025
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:51,320
<32-12,ALAN>别这么大声
<32-12,ALAN>Shh! Not so loud.

1026
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,400
<32-12,ALAN>我头疼的快炸了似的
<32-12,ALAN>I've got a splitting headache.

1027
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,430
<32-13,RYAN>我来  叫辆救护车吧
<32-13,RYAN>I'll, uh, call an ambulance?

1028
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:56,080
<32-14,ALAN>放轻松  我没事
<32-14,ALAN>Relax. I'm fine.

1029
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:58,290
<32-14,ALAN>我只需要吃两片止痛片
<32-14,ALAN>I just need a couple of Advil.

1030
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,610
<32-14,ALAN>-怎么  出什么事了  卡塞尔  -你
<32-14,ALAN>- What? What is it, Castle? - You --

1031
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:03,900
<32-16,ALAN>我脑袋上是不是被开了一枪
<32-16,ALAN>Did I get shot in the head?

1032
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:06,170
<32-17,CASTLE>正中间  我是说  你怎么可能
<32-17,CASTLE>Right in the middle! I mean, how did you even --

1033
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:07,580
<32-17,CASTLE>等一下  这说明你看到杀你的人了
<32-17,CASTLE>Wait, that means you've seen your killer.

1034
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:08,800
<32-17,CASTLE>谁  是谁
<32-17,CASTLE>Who -- Who was it?

1035
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:10,530
<32-18,ALAN>你肯定猜不到
<32-18,ALAN>You're never gonna guess.

1036
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:14,400
<32-19,ESPOSITO>我在她准备给药剂师麦克来一枪的时候抓住了她
<32-19,ESPOSITO>I took her down just before she put a bullet in Mike the chemist.

1037
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:16,600
<32-20,GWEN>该死的你为什么就是不肯死
<32-20,GWEN>Why the hell won't you die?

1038
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:21,120
<32-21,CASTLE>我一直都不觉得她适合你
<32-21,CASTLE>I never thought she was right for you.

1039
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:25,400
<33-1,CASTLE>我见过的最酷的事情
<33-1,CASTLE>Coolest thing ever.

1040
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:30,010
<33-2,LANIE>如你所见  子弹射进却没有穿透
<33-2,LANIE>As you can see, the slug pierced but didn't penetrate

1041
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:32,230
<33-2,LANIE>阿兰头骨的垂直板
<33-2,LANIE>the vertical plate of Alan's skull.

1042
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:35,450
<33-3,LANIE>真的吗  我知道那只是个点22口径的左轮手枪
<33-3,LANIE>Really? I realize it was only a .22-caliber revolver,

1043
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:38,050
<33-3,LANIE>但那可是近距离射击
<33-3,LANIE>but it was fired at point-blank range.

1044
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:40,850
<33-4,ALAN>你听起来对我还活着有点失望
<33-4,ALAN>Hey, you sound a little upset that I'm still alive.

1045
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:43,200
<33-5,LANIE>不  我只是  好啦
<33-5,LANIE>No. It's just -- Oh, come on.

1046
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,240
<33-6,BECKETT>我想这次你应该无法解释了
<33-6,BECKETT>I don't suppose you have an explanation this time.

1047
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,650
<33-6,BECKETT>介于他在过去的48小时里已经死了三次
<33-6,BECKETT>Well, considering he's already died three times in 48 hours,

1048
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:50,730
<33-7,LANIE>这还重要吗
<33-7,LANIE>does it even matter?

1049
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:52,340
<33-7,LANIE>终于体会我的心情了吧
<33-7,LANIE>Welcome to the club.

1050
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:55,550
<33-7,LANIE>阿兰  从专业医学角度出发
<33-7,LANIE>Alan, it's my professional medical opinion

1051
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:57,860
<33-8,ALAN>你是我见过的最幸运的
<33-8,ALAN>that you're the luckiest man who's ever lived

1052
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:00,160
<33-8,ALAN>死而复生的人
<33-8,ALAN>and kept living even after he died.

1053
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,290
<33-8,ALAN>谢了  医生
<33-8,ALAN>Thanks, Doc.

1054
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,050
<33-9,CASTLE>你感觉如何
<33-9,CASTLE>How you feeling?

1055
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,990
<33-10,ALAN>要知道  我很感激
<33-10,ALAN>You know, I'm grateful.

1056
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:07,370
<33-10,ALAN>尤其是我新交到的朋友
<33-10,ALAN>Especially for the new friend I made.

1057
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:10,680
<33-10,ALAN>我非常希望我们可以保持联系
<33-10,ALAN>I sure hope we could stay in touch.

1058
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,170
<33-11,CASTLE>你在开玩笑吗  你和我
<33-11,CASTLE>Are you kidding? You and me?

1059
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:14,450
<33-11,CASTLE>这会是一个美丽的开始
<33-11,CASTLE>This is the start of a beautiful --

1060
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,330
<33-12,BECKETT>我不觉得他是在和你说话
<33-12,BECKETT>I don't think he's talking to you.

1061
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:20,120
<33-13,LANIE>也许你有一些我们没见过的特殊能力
<33-13,LANIE>Hey, maybe you have a few secret powers we haven't seen yet.

1062
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:21,640
<33-14,CASTLE>就像我一直说的那样
<33-14,CASTLE>Which is what I've been saying all along.

1063
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:24,030
<33-15,LANIE>但是也许这些能力的发现
<33-15,LANIE>But perhaps discovery of those abilities

1064
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:26,720
<33-15,LANIE>最好交给一个医学专家
<33-15,LANIE>is best left to a medical expert.

1065
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,790
<33-16,LANIE>回见  卡塞尔
<33-16,LANIE>Buh-bye, Castle.

1066
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:29,700
<33-16,LANIE>慢走不送
<33-16,LANIE>Get to stepping.

1067
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:34,230
<34-1,BECKETT>好  谢谢
<34-1,BECKETT>Okay, yeah, thanks.

1068
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:35,810
<34-2,BECKETT>是维克拉姆
<34-2,BECKETT>That was Vikram.

1069
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:39,390
<34-2,BECKETT>缉毒组逮捕了霍雷肖和白莲教的几个成员
<34-2,BECKETT>The DEA just arrested Horatio and a few members of the Triad.

1070
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:40,410
<34-3,CASTLE>所以有什么不对
<34-3,CASTLE>So, what's wrong?

1071
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:42,350
<34-4,BECKETT>和卡莱布约定的期限已经过了
<34-4,BECKETT>Caleb's deadline has come and gone

1072
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:43,780
<34-4,BECKETT>维克拉姆说他失踪了
<34-4,BECKETT>and Vikram's said that he's disappeared.

1073
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,000
<34-4,BECKETT>他潜逃了
<34-4,BECKETT>He gone off-grid.

1074
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:46,040
<34-5,CASTLE>他在逃命
<34-5,CASTLE>He's running.

1075
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:49,090
<34-5,CASTLE>不敢面对洛克塞特  不敢和我们合作
<34-5,CASTLE>Too scared to face LokSat, too scared to work with us.

1076
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:51,060
<34-6,BECKETT>这意味着我们失去了唯一的线索
<34-6,BECKETT>Which means we just lost our only lead.

1077
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,520
<34-7,CASTLE>所以我们要怎么做
<34-7,CASTLE>So, what do we do?

1078
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,770
<34-8,BECKETT>我不知道  也许你是对的
<34-8,BECKETT>I don't know. Maybe you're right.

1079
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:56,400
<34-8,BECKETT>也许是时候有所改变了
<34-8,BECKETT>Maybe it is time for a change.

1080
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:00,070
<34-9,CASTLE>我听说这个时候的巴黎很不错
<34-9,CASTLE>I hear Paris is nice this time of year.

1081
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:04,880
<34-9,CASTLE>只要和你在一起  我去哪都好
<34-9,CASTLE>So long as I'm with you, I'll go anywhere.

1082
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:11,200
<35-1,CALEB>别  别开枪
<35-1,CALEB>Oh, don't -- don't shoot me.

1083
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,000
<35-1,CALEB>我会把我的苏格兰威士忌洒了的
<35-1,CALEB>I might spill my Scotch.

1084
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:14,760
<35-2,CASTLE>我想你说的是我的苏格兰威士忌
<35-2,CASTLE>I think you mean my Scotch.

1085
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:17,870
<35-2,CASTLE>而且是我最贵的苏格兰威士忌
<35-2,CASTLE>And my most expensive Scotch.

1086
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:18,800
<35-3,CALEB>物有所值
<35-3,CALEB>It's worth it.

1087
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,530
<35-4,BECKETT>你改变主意了  卡莱布
<35-4,BECKETT>You had a change of heart, Caleb?

1088
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:24,220
<35-5,CALEB>要知道  每天早晨我们醒来
<35-5,CALEB>You know, every morning we wake up

1089
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:26,800
<35-5,CALEB>然后选择我们要做谁
<35-5,CALEB>and we choose who we want to be.

1090
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,550
<35-5,CALEB>我醒来然后问自己  为什么我这样选择
<35-5,CALEB>I wake up and I ask myself, "Why are you choosing this?"

1091
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:34,950
<35-5,CALEB>因为你说的对  凯特  我曾经是个好人
<35-5,CALEB>Because you're right, Kate. I was a good guy once.

1092
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,640
<35-6,BECKETT>你仍然可以是
<35-6,BECKETT>And you still can be.

1093
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,120
<35-6,BECKETT>谁是洛克赛特
<35-6,BECKETT>Who is LokSat?

1094
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:40,940
<35-7,CALEB>我不知道
<35-7,CALEB>I don't know.

1095
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,900
<35-8,CASTLE>算了吧  你为他效力
<35-8,CASTLE>Oh, come on. You work for him.

1096
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:46,030
<35-9,CALEB>是  但我最开始是为他的同伙工作
<35-9,CALEB>Yes. But I started out working for his partner.

1097
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:47,920
<35-10,BECKETT>威廉·布莱肯议员
<35-10,BECKETT>Senator William Bracken?

1098
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:50,290
<35-12,BECKETT>所以  怎么  洛克赛特把你接过去了
<35-12,BECKETT>So, what, LokSat inherited you?

1099
00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:51,490
<35-13,CALEB>更像是招募
<35-13,CALEB>It was more like drafted.

1100
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,570
<35-13,CALEB>布莱肯被杀之后
<35-13,CALEB>After Bracken's murder,

1101
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:55,450
<35-13,CALEB>我在我的门阶上收到了这个和一张便笺
<35-13,CALEB>I received this on my doorstep with a note.

1102
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:58,520
<35-13,CALEB>上面写着"布朗先生  现在开始你为我工作"
<35-13,CALEB>And I quote, "Mr. Brown, you now work for me.

1103
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:01,330
<35-13,CALEB>这个手机是用卫星定位启动的
<35-13,CALEB>This cellphone is enabled with GPS and will only function

1104
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:03,990
<35-13,CALEB>只有在艾斯特公园最北边才能用
<35-13,CALEB>at the northernmost end of Astor Park.

1105
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:07,110
<35-13,CALEB>每月第三个周一早晨八点到那里
<35-13,CALEB>Be there every third Monday of the month at 8:00 a.m.

1106
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:08,480
<35-13,CALEB>接受指令
<35-13,CALEB>to receive your orders.

1107
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,080
<35-13,CALEB>凯特  这是你的了
<35-13,CALEB>Kate, it's yours.

1108
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,840
<35-14,CALEB>希望下次通话你可以追踪到洛克赛特
<35-14,CALEB>And hopefully you can trace LokSat's next call.

1109
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:13,930
<35-15,BECKETT>他们会知道我不是你
<35-15,BECKETT>They're gonna know I'm not you.

1110
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:16,820
<35-16,CALEB>我们没有对话  电话响  我接
<35-16,CALEB>We don't have a conversation. The phone rings, I answer.

1111
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:19,320
<35-16,CALEB>一个电脑处理过的声音告诉我指令
<35-16,CALEB>An electronically modified voice gives me instructions.

1112
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:22,300
<35-16,CALEB>整个过程持续不到60秒
<35-16,CALEB>It lasts no more than 60 seconds,

1113
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:23,830
<35-16,CALEB>所以让你最得力的手下做好准备
<35-16,CALEB>so have your best people ready.

1114
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:32,570
<35-17,CASTLE>你去哪里
<35-17,CASTLE>Where are you going?

1115
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:37,360
<35-18,CALEB>我会去以前去的地方  办公室  家
<35-18,CALEB>I'm gonna go to the same places that I always go -- work, home.

1116
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:39,210
<35-18,CALEB>我会装作一切照旧
<35-18,CALEB>I'm gonna act as if nothing has changed.

1117
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:41,810
<35-19,BECKETT>但是一切已经变了  我们可以保护你
<35-19,BECKETT>Yeah, but it has. And we can protect you.

1118
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,410
<35-20,CALEB>我想从你这里得到的只有你的承诺
<35-20,CALEB>All I want from you is your promise

00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:45,520
<35-20,CALEB>承诺你会坚持到底
<35-20,CALEB>that you will see this thing through.

00:41:45,790 --> 00:41:47,250
<35-20,CALEB>记得我今天的选择
<35-20,CALEB>And remember who I chose to be today

1121
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:50,120
<35-20,CALEB>因为没有其他人会这样做
<35-20,CALEB>because nobody else will.

1122
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,830
<35-20,CALEB>那个苏格兰威士忌真是太好喝了  里克
<35-20,CALEB>That's a damn fine Scotch, Rick.

1123
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:58,930
<35-21,CASTLE>就是它了
<35-21,CASTLE>This is it.

1124
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:01,920
<35-21,CASTLE>-这是我们接近洛克赛特的唯一机会  -是的
<35-21,CASTLE>- It's our one shot at LokSat. - Yeah.
