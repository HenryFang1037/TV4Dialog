00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:01,910
<11-3,BECKETT>-我们现在该怎么办  -等
<11-3,BECKETT>- So what do we do now? - We wait.

244
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:03,960
<11-4,ROMAN>-但是我  -但是什么
<11-4,ROMAN>- But I... - But what?

245
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:06,250
<11-5,ROMAN>-长官  -抱歉
<11-5,ROMAN>- Sir? - Excuse me.

246
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:11,720
<11-6,GATES>你在想什么
<11-6,GATES>What are you thinking?

247
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:16,150
<11-7,BECKETT>-长官  你确定那女人没案底吗  -怎么了
<11-7,BECKETT>- Sir, are you sure that this woman doesn't have a record? - Why?

248
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:19,110
<11-9,BECKETT>因为她看起来非常不信任警察
<11-9,BECKETT>Because she seems to have a deep mistrust of the police.

249
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:20,490
<11-10,GATES>显然  还有些东西
<11-10,GATES>Well, obviously, there's more to it

250
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,430
<11-10,GATES>不在系统资料里
<11-10,GATES>than what's in the system.

251
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,010
<11-11,BECKETT>我知道我已经不在这工作了  但
<11-11,BECKETT>Look, I know I'm not on the job anymore, but...

252
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,310
<11-12,GATES>你想去检查犯罪现场
<11-12,GATES>You want to work the crime scene.

253
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,940
<11-13,BECKETT>多一双眼睛也没什么坏处
<11-13,BECKETT>It can't hurt to have an extra pair of eyes.

254
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:29,640
<11-13,BECKETT>而且我们对艾玛了解得更多
<11-13,BECKETT>And the more we find out about Emma,

255
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:31,260
<11-13,BECKETT>我们救出卡塞尔和人质们的可能性
<11-13,BECKETT>the better chance we'll have of getting castle

256
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,630
<11-13,BECKETT>-就越大  -去吧
<11-13,BECKETT>- and the hostages... - Go.

257
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,150
<11-13,BECKETT>好吧  艾玛
<11-13,BECKETT>All right, Emma.

258
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,890
<12-1,CASTLE>你没杀你的男友
<12-1,CASTLE>So... you didn't kill your boyfriend.

259
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:45,500
<12-1,CASTLE>我们来想想是谁杀的
<12-1,CASTLE>Let's figure out who did.

260
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:47,980
<12-1,CASTLE>我的所有故事的开头都是
<12-1,CASTLE>As you know, all my stories start in the same place

261
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:49,800
<12-1,CASTLE>一样的  告诉我发生了什么
<12-1,CASTLE>in the beginning. So tell me what happened.

262
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:53,420
<12-2,EMMA>-我昨晚回家晚了  -你为什么回家晚了
<12-2,EMMA>- I got home late last night. - Why did you get home late?

263
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,380
<12-3,CASTLE>下班之后  我  我买了条裙子
<12-3,CASTLE>Well, after work, I-I-- I, um, I bought a dress.

264
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:58,770
<12-4,EMMA>因为今天是我的生日
<12-4,EMMA>Because today's my birthday. Um...

265
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,690
<12-4,EMMA>安其罗本来今晚会带我出去吃饭
<12-4,EMMA>Angelo was, uh, was gonna take me out to dinner tonight.

266
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,260
<12-4,EMMA>他有惊喜给我
<12-4,EMMA>He worked out some sort of surprise.

267
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:07,920
<12-4,EMMA>说这会是我一辈子都忘不掉的生日
<12-4,EMMA>Said it'd be a birthday I'd never forget, so...

268
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:09,940
<12-5,CASTLE>知道是什么样的惊喜吗
<12-5,CASTLE>Any idea what the surprise was?

269
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,420
<12-6,EMMA>求婚吧
<12-6,EMMA>A marriage proposal.

270
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,650
<12-6,EMMA>至少我  我是这么希望的
<12-6,EMMA>At least I was-- that's what I was hoping.

271
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:15,970
<12-6,EMMA>所以我才买了那条裙子
<12-6,EMMA>That's why I bought the dress,

272
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:19,080
<12-6,EMMA>虽然我买不起  很傻  对吧
<12-6,EMMA>even though I couldn't afford it. Just stupid, huh?

273
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:20,390
<12-7,CASTLE>不  一点都不傻
<12-7,CASTLE>No. Not at all.

274
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:23,980
<12-7,CASTLE>你买了裙子  然后呢
<12-7,CASTLE>So you have your dress, and...

276
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,600

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,360
<12-9,CASTLE>然后呢
<12-9,CASTLE>And then what happened?

280
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:37,480
<12-10,EMMA>早上起来的时候
<12-10,EMMA>When I woke up in the morning, I...

281
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,670
<12-10,EMMA>发现安其罗在地上
<12-10,EMMA>I found Angelo on the floor,

<12-11,CASTLE>-然后你做了什么  -我吓坏了
<12-11,CASTLE>- Well, what did you do? - I-I panicked.

<12-12,EMMA>我就逃到这来了
<12-12,EMMA>Here I am.

<12-13,MICKEY>是啊  用枪挟持我们  真是个疯子女友
<12-13,MICKEY>Yeah, holding us at gunpoint. Talk about a psycho girlfriend.

<12-15,SUE>-你说什么  -你想害死我们吗
<12-15,SUE>- What did you say?! - Are you trying to get us killed?

<12-16,CASTLE>艾玛  放松
<12-16,CASTLE>Okay, okay. Emma, relax.

<12-16,CASTLE>Ignore him. Just focus on me, all right?

295
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:20,570
<12-16,CASTLE>-安其罗有你家的钥匙吗  -有
<12-16,CASTLE>- Did Angelo have a key to your place? - Yes.

<12-18,CASTLE>但昨晚你没让他过来
<12-18,CASTLE>But you didn't make any plans for him to come over last night?

297
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,140
<12-19,EMMA>对
<12-19,EMMA>No.

<12-23,EMMA>一杯  两指高
<12-23,EMMA>One glass. The--the two fingers.

<12-24,CASTLE>我需要你再给我捋一遍
<12-24,CASTLE>I'm gonna need you to walk me through this again.

305
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:48,630
<13-3,LANIE>我不是这个意思
<13-3,LANIE>That's not what I meant.

306
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:51,020
<13-3,LANIE>你不是应该在看婚礼场地什么的吗
<13-3,LANIE>Shouldn't you be off looking at wedding venues or something?

307
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,250
<13-4,BECKETT>没  我们连时间都没定
<13-4,BECKETT>No, we haven't even set a date.

00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,090
<13-4,BECKETT>我们只想享受订婚的欢乐时光
<13-4,BECKETT>We're just trying to enjoy our engagement.

309
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,590
<13-4,BECKETT>为什么每个人都在催我们
<13-4,BECKETT>Why is everyone trying to rush us?

310
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:57,530
<13-5,KEVIN RYAN>你以为这就算催了吗
<13-5,KEVIN RYAN>Think you're being rushed now,

311
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:58,790
<13-5,KEVIN RYAN>等婚礼之后吧
<13-5,KEVIN RYAN>wait until after the wedding.

312
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:01,110
<13-5,KEVIN RYAN>刚下圣坛不到十分钟  所有人都会问
<13-5,KEVIN RYAN>Not ten minutes from the altar, they'll all be like,

313
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,050
<13-5,KEVIN RYAN>"你们什么时候生小宝宝啊"
<13-5,KEVIN RYAN>"When are you two having a baby?"

314
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:04,260
<13-6,JAVIER ESPOSITO>兄弟  你老婆情绪不稳定是因为怀孕了
<13-6,JAVIER ESPOSITO>Bro, your wife's hormonal because she's pregnant.

315
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:05,610
<13-6,JAVIER ESPOSITO>你又是为什么呢
<13-6,JAVIER ESPOSITO>What's your excuse?

316
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:08,110
<13-7,BECKETT>我猜这是艾玛的男友
<13-7,BECKETT>So I take it this is Emma's boyfriend?

317
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:10,860
<13-8,LANIE>曾经是  直到她拿了厨房的刀子
<13-8,LANIE>He was, until she stabbed him three times with a knife...

318
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:12,400
<13-8,LANIE>刺了他三刀
<13-8,LANIE>from the kitchen butcher block.

319
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,110
<13-9,BECKETT>艾玛声称自己是无辜的
<13-9,BECKETT>Emma's claiming that she's innocent.

320
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,660
<13-9,BECKETT>有没有可能是别人做的
<13-9,BECKETT>Is there any chance that someone else did this?

321
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,020
<13-10,RYAN>没有其他纤维和指纹
<13-10,RYAN>No foreign fibers or prints.

322
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,440
<13-10,RYAN>所有的证据都指向艾玛
<13-10,RYAN>All evidence is pointing towards Emma.

323
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,020
<13-11,BECKETT>-有动机了吗  -有
<13-11,BECKETT>- Any ideas on motive? - Oh, yeah.

324
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,500
<13-11,BECKETT>这是安其罗的手机
<13-11,BECKETT>This is Angelo's cell phone.

325
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,800
<13-12,ESPOSITO>看他和艾玛发的短信
<13-12,ESPOSITO>Check out the text history between him and Emma.

326
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:25,630
<13-12,ESPOSITO>她指责他与斯卡斯代尔的
<13-12,ESPOSITO>She was accusing him of having an affair

327
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:26,950
<13-12,ESPOSITO>某个小妞有染
<13-12,ESPOSITO>with some chick up in Scarsdale.

328
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:29,240
<13-13,RYAN>我们在安其罗的口袋里发现了这个
<13-13,RYAN>And we found this in Angelo's pocket.

329
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:32,020
<13-13,RYAN>锯木厂河公路  SH
<13-13,RYAN>"S.H. off Saw Mill River Parkway."

330
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,540
<13-14,BECKETT>锯木厂河公路是从纽约
<13-14,BECKETT>Saw Mill River Parkway is the way to Scarsdale

331
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,300
<13-14,BECKETT>去斯卡斯代尔的路
<13-14,BECKETT>from the city.

332
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:38,020
<13-15,RYAN>SH可能是和他约会的女孩名字首字母
<13-15,RYAN>"S.H." could be the initials of the lady he was seeing on the side.

333
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,590
<13-16,BECKETT>听听这个
<13-16,BECKETT>A-and listen to this--

334
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,740
<13-16,BECKETT>昨晚9:47艾玛给安其罗发短信
<13-16,BECKETT>Emma texts Angelo last night at 9:47

335
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:45,460
<13-16,BECKETT>说她喝多了  很寂寞  想要见他
<13-16,BECKETT>saying she's drunk, lonely, and wants to see him.

336
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:47,590
<13-17,ESPOSITO>一个空的威士忌酒瓶
<13-17,ESPOSITO>And here is an empty bottle of Scotch.

337
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:50,270
<13-17,ESPOSITO>女士们先生们  这是深夜打炮进展不顺的结果
<13-17,ESPOSITO>Ladies and gentlemen, this is a booty call gone wrong.

338
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,250
<13-17,ESPOSITO>这些都讲不通啊
<13-17,ESPOSITO>None of this makes any sense.

339
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,380
<13-18,BECKETT>如果真是她杀了他
<13-18,BECKETT>I mean, if she actually killed him,

340
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:54,220
<13-18,BECKETT>为什么不要求去国外的机票
<13-18,BECKETT>then why isn't she asking for a flight out of the country?

341
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:56,470
<13-18,BECKETT>而是坚持让我们证明她的清白
<13-18,BECKETT>why is she insisting that she's innocent?

342
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:58,360
<13-19,RYAN>也许她不正常
<13-19,RYAN>Uh, maybe because she's crazy.

343
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:59,830
<13-19,RYAN>我找到了她的处方药
<13-19,RYAN>I found Emma's prescriptions--

344
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,420
<13-19,RYAN>氯硝西泮和阿立哌唑
<13-19,RYAN>Clonazepam and aripiprazole.

345
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:03,720
<13-19,RYAN>蕾妮  这些都是治疗精神病的吧
<13-19,RYAN>Lanie, aren't those antipsychotics?

346
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,810
<13-20,LANIE>有一个是  另一个是治疗情绪紊乱的
<13-20,LANIE>One is, the other one's for mood disorders.

347
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,850
<13-20,LANIE>如果艾玛停药的话
<13-20,LANIE>Hey, you know, if Emma stopped taking her meds,

348
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,360
<13-20,LANIE>她可能会精神崩溃
<13-20,LANIE>she could have had a psychotic break.

349
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,470
<13-21,BECKETT>也就是说她可能忘记自己做了什么
<13-21,BECKETT>Which means she wouldn't remember what she did.

350
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:13,840
<13-21,BECKETT>-我得提醒卡塞尔  -贝克特  淡定
<13-21,BECKETT>- We have to warn Castle. - Beckett, relax.

351
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,490
<13-22,ESPOSITO>他只是和那个女打电话而已
<13-22,ESPOSITO>He's just on the phone with the woman.

352
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:16,700
<13-23,BECKETT>不  他进去了
<13-23,BECKETT>No. He went in.

353
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,350
<14-1,CASTLE>好吧  等会打给你
<14-1,CASTLE>Okay. Let me call you back.

354
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,580
<14-2,EMMA>贝克特探长有发现了吗
<14-2,EMMA>Did Detective Beckett find anything?

355
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:29,240
<14-3,CASTLE>艾玛  如果你不和我说实话  我没办法帮你
<14-3,CASTLE>Emma, I can't help you if you're not honest with me.

356
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,520
<14-4,EMMA>我说的都是实话
<14-4,EMMA>But I have been honest.

357
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,160
<14-5,CASTLE>你说你和安其罗之间没有问题
<14-5,CASTLE>You said everything between you and Angelo was all right.

358
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,160
<14-6,EMMA>对啊
<14-6,EMMA>Yeah, it was.

359
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:36,140
<14-7,CASTLE>那你没怀疑过他出轨咯
<14-7,CASTLE>So you didn't suspect him of cheating?

360
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:43,630
<14-8,EMMA>没有  只是他一直去斯卡斯代尔
<14-8,EMMA>No, it--it's just that he kept going up to Scarsdale

361
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:44,840
<14-8,EMMA>却不说为什么
<14-8,EMMA>without saying why.

362
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:47,060
<14-8,EMMA>-我确定那不重要  -确定吗
<14-8,EMMA>- I-I'm sure it was nothing. - Are you?

363
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,570
<14-9,CASTLE>有没有可能  你想和他当面对质
<14-9,CASTLE>Or could it be that you wanted to confront him?

364
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,620
<14-9,CASTLE>所以你才在昨晚发短信给他
<14-9,CASTLE>And maybe that's why you texted Angelo last night

365
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:55,930
<14-9,CASTLE>让他去你家
<14-9,CASTLE>and invited him over.

366
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,070
<14-10,EMMA>你在说什么啊
<14-10,EMMA>What are you talking about?

367
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:58,490
<14-11,CASTLE>看你的手机  艾玛
<14-11,CASTLE>Look at your phone, Emma.

368
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,150
<14-12,EMMA>等一下  我没...
<14-12,EMMA>Wait, I don't...

369
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:08,850
<14-12,EMMA>我不记得我发过这些短信
<14-12,EMMA>No, I don't remember writing these texts.

370
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,850
<14-13,CASTLE>你不记得不代表你没做过
<14-13,CASTLE>Just because you don't remember doesn't mean you didn't.

371
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:13,500
<14-13,CASTLE>就好像你只记得你喝了一杯威士忌
<14-13,CASTLE>Just like you only remember having one glass of scotch.

372
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:14,650
<14-13,CASTLE>但如果你喝了不止一杯呢
<14-13,CASTLE>But what if you had more?

373
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:18,270
<14-13,CASTLE>她们发现了你的酒瓶  艾玛  是空的
<14-13,CASTLE>They found your Scotch bottle, Emma. It was empty.

374
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,470
<14-14,EMMA>我没有喝完一整瓶
<14-14,EMMA>I-I didn't finish the bottle.

375
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:22,550
<14-15,CASTLE>也许你喝了  只不过忘记了
<14-15,CASTLE>Maybe you did, and you just can't remember.

376
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:23,330
<14-16,EMMA>胡扯
<14-16,EMMA>That is ridiculous!

377
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,660
<14-19,CASTLE>事实上这不是瞎说
<14-19,CASTLE>Uh, um, a-actually, it's not.

378
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,640
<14-22,EMMA>如果一个人喝了太多
<14-22,EMMA>If someone's had too much to drink,

379
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,320
<14-24,EMMA>可能会暂时丧失意识
<14-24,EMMA>they can suffer what's called an en bloc blackout.

380
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,440
<14-27,CASTLE>让大脑没办法制造新记忆
<14-27,CASTLE>It prevents the brain from creating new memories.

381
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,910
<14-17,CASTLE>艾玛  你想让我
<14-17,CASTLE>Emma, you wanted me...

382
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:39,190
<14-17,CASTLE>揭露真相
<14-17,CASTLE>to uncover the truth.

383
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:45,950
<14-17,CASTLE>不
<14-17,CASTLE>No.

384
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:48,170
<14-18,EMMA>你不能也这样
<14-18,EMMA>Not you.

385
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:50,550
<14-18,EMMA>求你  别告诉我你也不相信我
<14-18,EMMA>Please don't tell me that you don't believe me.

386
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,030
<14-18,EMMA>我没有杀安其罗
<14-18,EMMA>I didn't kill Angelo, okay?

387
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,100
<14-18,EMMA>我想嫁给他
<14-18,EMMA>I mean, I-I wanted to marry him.

388
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,920
<14-18,EMMA>我不会这么做的
<14-18,EMMA>I wouldn't do this!

389
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:00,700
<14-18,EMMA>天啊
<14-18,EMMA>Oh, god.

390
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:05,480
<14-18,EMMA>天啊  我...
<14-18,EMMA>God... did I? I--

391
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,520
<14-18,EMMA>万一真的是我
<14-18,EMMA>What if I did? I don't...

392
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:11,310
<14-20,EMMA>怎么了
<14-20,EMMA>What?

393
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:13,100
<14-21,CASTLE>你怎么写"爱你"
<14-21,CASTLE>How do you text "Love you"?

394
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:13,960
<14-22,EMMA>什么意思
<14-22,EMMA>What do you mean?

395
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,900
<14-23,CASTLE>当你写"爱你"的时候  你怎么拼的
<14-23,CASTLE>When you write "Love you," how do you spell it?

396
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,430
<14-24,EMMA>打一个横躺的心再加字母"U"
<14-24,EMMA>Do a sideways heart and the letter "U."

397
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:21,340
<14-25,CASTLE>没错  除了昨晚
<14-25,CASTLE>Right, except for last night,

398
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,730
<14-25,CASTLE>你把它完整拼了出来  "爱你"
<14-25,CASTLE>when you just spelled it out-- "Love you."

399
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:25,840
<14-26,EMMA>不可能  我从不把它拼完整
<14-26,EMMA>No. I never spell it out.

400
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,710
<14-27,CASTLE>而且昨晚短信的语气
<14-27,CASTLE>And the voice in those texts from last night--

401
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:29,560
<14-27,CASTLE>也和往常的不一样
<14-27,CASTLE>it's--it's different from the others.

402
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:31,470
<14-28,EMMA>就像是别人写的吗
<14-28,EMMA>As if somebody else wrote them?

403
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:32,700
<14-29,CASTLE>可能  我不确定
<14-29,CASTLE>Maybe. I don't know.

404
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,190
<14-30,EMMA>如果这短信不是我写的
<14-30,EMMA>Well, if I didn't write these, that means

405
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:36,150
<14-30,EMMA>那就是另有其人  对吗
<14-30,EMMA>that somebody else did, right?

406
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,780
<14-30,EMMA>也就是说  凶手用了我的手机
<14-30,EMMA>Which means the killer used my phone!

407
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:46,540
<14-31,EMMA>你得把手机拿去验指纹
<14-31,EMMA>You have to dust this for prints.

408
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:49,300
<14-31,EMMA>快点  快  你得把凶手找出来
<14-31,EMMA>Come on. Come on. You have to find the killer.

409
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,450
<14-32,KOGAN>-等等  什么  -你不会丢下我们不管吧
<14-32,KOGAN>- Wait, what? - You're not leaving us, are you?

410
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:53,770
<14-33,CASTLE>不  我会救你们出去
<14-33,CASTLE>No. I-I'm gonna get you outta here.

411
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:55,050
<14-34,MICKEY>说得跟真的似的
<14-34,MICKEY>Like hell you are.

412
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:57,100
<14-34,MICKEY>等着瞧吧  你和警察肯定不会有所行动
<14-34,MICKEY>Look, if you or the cops aren't gonna do anything,

413
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,780
<14-34,MICKEY>-我敢肯定  -闭嘴
<14-34,MICKEY>- I sure as hell am. - Shut up!

414
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:01,830
<14-35,EMMA>你还在等什么  快  快走  行吗
<14-35,EMMA>What are you waiting for? Come on! Just go, okay?

415
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:06,360
<14-36,CASTLE>米奇  别做傻事  拜托
<14-36,CASTLE>Mickey, don't do anything. Please.

416
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:17,960
<15-1,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<15-1,BECKETT>Castle!

417
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,970
<15-2,ROMAN>卡塞尔先生  怎么回事  里面什么情况
<15-2,ROMAN>Mr. Castle, what happened? What is going on in there?

418
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:25,050
<15-2,ROMAN>我们有麻烦了
<15-2,ROMAN>We got problems.

419
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:28,640
<15-3,CASTLE>退一步说  艾玛不太稳定
<15-3,CASTLE>Emma is unstable, to say the least.

420
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,720
<15-3,CASTLE>但这还不是最糟的  里面有个人质
<15-3,CASTLE>But that's not the worst of it. There's a hostage in there--

421
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,110
<15-3,CASTLE>看多了《虎胆龙威》
<15-3,CASTLE>He's seen "Die Hard" too many times.

422
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,360
<15-3,CASTLE>他总想在那儿充英雄
<15-3,CASTLE>He's gonna try and be a hero.

423
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,690
<15-3,CASTLE>还有件事我觉得你应该知道
<15-3,CASTLE>And there's something else I think you need to know.

424
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:36,190
<15-4,BECKETT>什么
<15-4,BECKETT>What's that?

425
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,090
<15-5,CASTLE>艾玛说的可能是实话
<15-5,CASTLE>Emma might actually be telling the truth.

426
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,630
<15-6,BECKETT>什么实话
<15-6,BECKETT>The truth about what?

427
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:43,690
<15-7,CASTLE>贝克特  我想她可能是被人栽赃的
<15-7,CASTLE>Beckett, I think she's being framed for murder.

428
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,430
<16-1,CASTLE>但万一艾玛是对的呢
<16-1,CASTLE>But what if Emma is right?

429
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:51,080
<16-1,CASTLE>如果真有人编辑了这些短信
<16-1,CASTLE>What if someone else wrote those texts

430
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:52,720
<16-1,CASTLE>这只是一个完美的栽赃证据
<16-1,CASTLE>and this is all just an elaborate frame-up,

431
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,800
<16-1,CASTLE>而艾玛是无辜的呢
<16-1,CASTLE>and Emma's just a patsy?

432
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:56,180
<16-2,ESPOSITO>句法  大哥  你居然只因艾玛写短信的方式
<16-2,ESPOSITO>Syntax, bro? You're gonna base Emma's innocence

433
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,550
<16-2,ESPOSITO>就想说明她是无辜的
<16-2,ESPOSITO>on how she writes her texts?

434
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:59,710
<16-3,CASTLE>我是说有可能
<16-3,CASTLE>I'm just saying, it's possible.

435
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:02,660
<16-4,ESPOSITO>听着  如果我们能在罪案现场发现
<16-4,ESPOSITO>Look, if we found D.N.A. or prints

436
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:05,610
<16-4,ESPOSITO>DNA  指纹或纤维  这还有可能
<16-4,ESPOSITO>or fibers at the crime scene, maybe.

437
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:07,640
<16-5,RYAN>苏利  我们能从艾玛的手机上提取到有效指纹吗
<16-5,RYAN>Sully, we get any usable prints off Emma's cell phone?

438
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,040
<16-5,RYAN>不  但就算提取到了
<16-5,RYAN>No, but even if we did,

439
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,870
<16-6,CASTLE>怎么能说明是别人发的呢
<16-6,CASTLE>how could someone else have pulled this off?

440
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:12,750
<16-6,CASTLE>要在她不知情的情况下用她的手机
<16-6,CASTLE>To use her phone without her knowing,

441
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,090
<16-6,CASTLE>艾玛肯定得处于神志不清的状态
<16-6,CASTLE>Emma would have had to have been unconscious,

442
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:16,790
<16-6,CASTLE>有可能是别人打晕了她
<16-6,CASTLE>so someone could have knocked her out.

443
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:18,030
<16-6,CASTLE>她每晚都喝酒
<16-6,CASTLE>She has a scotch every night.

444
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,170
<16-6,CASTLE>也可能是在她的酒瓶里下药
<16-6,CASTLE>Someone could have dosed her bottle.

445
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:21,240
<16-7,SULLY>或者她可能就是个疯狂的粉丝
<16-7,SULLY>Or maybe she's just some crazed fan,

446
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,390
<16-7,SULLY>就像凯茜·贝茨在《危情十日》中演的
<16-7,SULLY>like Kathy Bates in "Misery."

447
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:26,180
<16-7,SULLY>你得庆幸你没摔断腿  不是吗
<16-7,SULLY>You should be happy you didn't get hobbled. Right?

448
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:31,170
<16-8,GATES>好了  这是你的案子
<16-8,GATES>Okay. This is your investigation.

449
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:32,570
<16-8,GATES>继续在艾玛身上挖线索
<16-8,GATES>Keep running the case on Emma.

450
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:33,950
<16-9,CASTLE>-可是  警监  我...  -让我说完
<16-9,CASTLE>- But, captain, I'm-- - Let me finish.

451
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:35,630
<16-10,GATES>听着  卡塞尔先生  多年来
<16-10,GATES>Look, Mr. Castle, over the years,

452
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:37,840
<16-10,GATES>不论你的理论有多离奇
<16-10,GATES>I have learned not to discount your little theories,

453
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,470
<16-10,GATES>我已经学会了不去低估它们
<16-10,GATES>no matter how fanciful.

454
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:42,890
<16-10,GATES>你和贝克特与苏利警探合作
<16-10,GATES>So why don't you and Beckett work with Detective Sully,

455
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:44,730
<16-10,GATES>看看能不能查到什么
<16-10,GATES>and let's see if there's something to this?

456
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:46,070
<16-11,BECKETT>-谢谢  长官  -谢谢
<16-11,BECKETT>- Thank you, sir. - Thank you.

457
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,640
<16-13,SULLY>我们从哪里开始
<16-13,SULLY>So, where do we start?

458
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:53,130
<16-14,BECKETT>从我们的被害人  安其罗·瓦奎斯开始
<16-14,BECKETT>By looking into our victim-- Angelo Vazquez.

459
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:55,070
<17-1,CASTLE>所有线索都证明一件事
<17-1,CASTLE>Everything here tells the same story.

460
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:57,100
<17-1,CASTLE>安其罗是个好人
<17-1,CASTLE>Angelo was a decent guy.

461
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:59,440
<17-1,CASTLE>十年前  在小偷小摸后
<17-1,CASTLE>Ten years ago, after some petty B&Es,

462
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,390
<17-1,CASTLE>他走上正道
<17-1,CASTLE>he turned his life around.

463
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:03,690
<17-1,CASTLE>他在高危少年所做志愿工作  很受爱戴
<17-1,CASTLE>He volunteered with at-risk youth, he was well-liked.

464
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:05,990
<17-1,CASTLE>他最近丢掉了修理工的工作
<17-1,CASTLE>He had been recently laid off from his mechanic's job,

465
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:07,010
<17-1,CASTLE>但他很积极
<17-1,CASTLE>but he was still upbeat.

466
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,250
<17-1,CASTLE>看不出谁杀了他  也看不出为什么
<17-1,CASTLE>There's nothing that explains who killed him or why,

467
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,030
<17-1,CASTLE>除了艾玛
<17-1,CASTLE>Other than Emma.

468
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:12,960
<17-2,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你忘了斯卡斯代尔
<17-2,BECKETT>Castle, you're forgetting about Scarsdale.

469
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,450
<17-3,CASTLE>你认为艾玛的怀疑是真的
<17-3,CASTLE>You think Emma's suspicious are true,

470
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:15,620
<17-3,CASTLE>他有外遇
<17-3,CASTLE>That he was having an affair?

471
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:17,110
<17-3,CASTLE>斯卡斯代尔的女人杀了他
<17-3,CASTLE>That some woman in Scarsdale killed him?

472
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,270
<17-4,BECKETT>斯卡斯代尔有线索  你看
<17-4,BECKETT>Well, something was going on in Scarsdale. Look at this.

473
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,570
<17-4,BECKETT>三晚之前
<17-4,BECKETT>Three nights ago,

474
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:26,010
<17-4,BECKETT>-斯卡斯代尔住户投诉了安其罗的车  -为什么
<17-4,BECKETT>- A resident complained about Angelo's car. - Why?

475
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:29,670
<17-6,BECKETT>苏利怎么在他桌子上找东西的
<17-6,BECKETT>How does Sully find anything on this desk?

476
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,200
<17-7,CASTLE>不知道  他有自己的系统吧
<17-7,CASTLE>I don't know. He must have a system.

477
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,580
<17-7,CASTLE>-我认为那原来是个百吉饼  -你知道吗
<17-7,CASTLE>- I think that was once a bagel. - Okay, you know what?

478
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:34,670
<17-8,BECKETT>查一查
<17-8,BECKETT>Here we go.

479
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,950
<17-8,BECKETT>斯卡斯代尔眺望路的住户
<17-8,BECKETT>A Scarsdale resident on overlook road

480
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:39,510
<17-8,BECKETT>将安其罗的车牌报给警方
<17-8,BECKETT>reported Angelo's license plate to the police.

481
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:43,620
<17-8,BECKETT>他说司机整整两个小时  自己待在车里
<17-8,BECKETT>He said the driver spent two hours drinking coffee

482
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,100
<17-8,BECKETT>喝咖啡
<17-8,BECKETT>alone in his car.

483
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,290
<17-9,CASTLE>在车里喝两个小时咖啡
<17-9,CASTLE>Two hours drinking coffee alone

484
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:48,910
<17-9,CASTLE>不像是有外遇
<17-9,CASTLE>doesn't sound like much of an affair.

485
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:50,790
<17-10,BECKETT>是啊  但他想干什么呢
<17-10,BECKETT>Yeah, but what was Angelo up to?

487
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,840
<17-10,BECKETT>是苏利
<17-10,BECKETT>Hey, it's Sully.

488
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:57,550
<17-11,SULLY>安其罗的公寓没有什么有趣的发现
<17-11,SULLY>There was nothing of interest at Angelo's apartment,

489
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:00,690
<17-11,SULLY>但他的车就是另一回事了
<17-11,SULLY>But his car is a whole other matter.

490
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:04,140
<17-11,SULLY>安其罗有个行李袋
<17-11,SULLY>Get this. Angelo had a duffel bag

491
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:07,250
<17-11,SULLY>装满了行窃用的工具
<17-11,SULLY>filled with tools of the burglar variety,

492
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:10,120
<17-11,SULLY>一栋房子的平面图
<17-11,SULLY>a floor plan to what looks like a house...

493
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:15,600
<17-11,SULLY>和一个兰柯-4700警报器的说明书
<17-11,SULLY>and a manual for a Ramco-4700 alarm system.

494
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,060
<17-11,SULLY>我认为他不是想安装报警系统
<17-11,SULLY>I don't think he was installing home security systems.

495
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,500
<17-12,BECKETT>安其罗没了工作
<17-12,BECKETT>Angelo was out of work.

496
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,200
<17-12,BECKETT>你认为他又重操旧业了吗
<17-12,BECKETT>Do you think he went back to committing B&E?

497
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,540
<17-13,CASTLE>只有一个人知道这个答案
<17-13,CASTLE>I only know one person with the answer to that question.

498
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,180
<18-1,MICKEY>计划是这样的
<18-1,MICKEY>Okay, here's the plan.

499
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:44,300
<18-1,MICKEY>医生  你假装癫痫发作
<18-1,MICKEY>Doc, act like you're having a seizure.

500
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,490
<18-2,KOGAN>什么
<18-2,KOGAN>Excuse me?

501
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,870
<18-3,MICKEY>然后  苏  你挤出几滴眼泪
<18-3,MICKEY>And then, Sue, you squirt out a few tears,

502
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:49,580
<18-3,MICKEY>求艾玛帮他
<18-3,MICKEY>Beg Emma to help him.

503
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:52,340
<18-3,MICKEY>她一帮忙  我就制住她  一切就结束了
<18-3,MICKEY>When she does, boom, I take her out, we end this,

504
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,890
<18-3,MICKEY>然后咱在街角的酒吧碰面
<18-3,MICKEY>then we meet at the bar around the corner,

505
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,080
<18-3,MICKEY>第一轮酒我请
<18-3,MICKEY>and the first round's on me.

506
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,490
<18-4,KOGAN>你疯了吗
<18-4,KOGAN>Are you out of your mind?

507
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,640
<18-5,SUE>这是最烂的计划
<18-5,SUE>That is the dumbest plan ever.

508
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,010
<18-6,MICKEY>算了  我自己动手
<18-6,MICKEY>Fine, I'll do it by myself.

509
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:08,150
<18-7,CASTLE>是卡塞尔
<18-7,CASTLE>It's Castle.

510
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:13,120
<18-8,CASTLE>我带了甜甜圈
<18-8,CASTLE>And I brought doughnuts.

511
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,620
<18-10,MICKEY>无麸质的吗
<18-10,MICKEY>Um... gluten-free?

512
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,720
<18-11,CASTLE>老兄  这是甜甜圈  爱吃不吃
<18-11,CASTLE>Dude, they're doughnuts. Either you're in or you're out.

513
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,000
<18-12,EMMA>有发现吗
<18-12,EMMA>You find out anything?

514
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,970
<18-13,CASTLE>艾玛  关于安其罗总去斯卡斯代尔  你知道些什么
<18-13,CASTLE>Emma, what do you know about Angelo's trips to Scarsdale?

515
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,520
<18-14,EMMA>不知道  他没跟我说过
<18-14,EMMA>Nothing. He wouldn't tell me.

516
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,690
<18-15,CASTLE>他会不会是去踩点  准备入室盗窃
<18-15,CASTLE>Is it possible he was there casing a house for a burglary?

517
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:32,620
<18-16,EMMA>什么...不  这太荒谬了
<18-16,EMMA>Wha--no. That's ridiculous.

518
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:35,440
<18-17,CASTLE>大写字母S.H.  能让你想到什么吗
<18-17,CASTLE>Do the initials "S.H." mean anything to you?

519
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:39,380
<18-19,CASTLE>是不是安其罗又开始犯罪了
<18-19,CASTLE>Could someone from Angelo's criminal past have come back?

520
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:41,850
<18-20,EMMA>那只是他年轻时犯的小错  仅此而已
<18-20,EMMA>Look, that was all petty stuff when he was a kid, that's all.

521
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:43,620
<18-21,CASTLE>对  但他不再是个孩子了
<18-21,CASTLE>Yes, but he wasn't a kid anymore.

522
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,870
<18-21,CASTLE>风险更高了  他失业了
<18-21,CASTLE>The stakes were higher. He was out of work.

523
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:48,120
<18-21,CASTLE>想在你生日时给你个惊喜
<18-21,CASTLE>He wanted to surprise you on your birthday,

524
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:50,160
<18-21,CASTLE>说不定是求婚
<18-21,CASTLE>Maybe propose.

525
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,660
<18-21,CASTLE>如果他准备这些的时候惹上了麻烦呢
<18-21,CASTLE>What if he got into trouble trying to make that happen?

526
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:03,910
<19-1,ESPOSITO>贝克特
<19-1,ESPOSITO>Yo, Beckett.

527
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,540
<19-1,ESPOSITO>卡塞尔人呢
<19-1,ESPOSITO>Where's Castle?

528
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:06,710
<19-2,RYAN>他不在里面吧
<19-2,RYAN>He's not in there, is he?

529
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:08,740
<19-4,ESPOSITO>-怎么了  -我们有发现
<19-4,ESPOSITO>- Why? - We found something.

530
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,360
<19-4,ESPOSITO>是关于艾玛的
<19-4,ESPOSITO>Something about Emma.

531
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:14,350
<19-4,ESPOSITO>艾玛
<19-4,ESPOSITO>Emma.

532
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,130
<20-1,CASTLE>放他们走吧
<20-1,CASTLE>Let these people go.

533
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,400
<20-1,CASTLE>已经可以了
<20-1,CASTLE>It worked.

534
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:21,230
<20-1,CASTLE>你把我引了过来  现在有希望了
<20-1,CASTLE>You got my attention. There's hope now.

535
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:23,670
<20-1,CASTLE>不
<20-1,CASTLE>No.

536
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:25,890
<20-2,EMMA>证明我的清白之前  不行
<20-2,EMMA>Not until my name is cleared. No.

537
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:30,980
<20-3,CASTLE>-贝克特的  -接吧
<20-3,CASTLE>- It's Beckett. - Go.

538
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:33,450
<20-5,CASTLE>贝克特
<20-5,CASTLE>Hey, Beckett.

539
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,350
<20-6,BECKETT>我告诉你件事儿不要有什么反应
<20-6,BECKETT>Do not react to what I'm about to tell you.

540
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:36,500
<20-7,CASTLE>好的
<20-7,CASTLE>Okay.

541
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:37,600
<20-8,BECKETT>艾玛从头到尾
<20-8,BECKETT>Emma has been playing you

542
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,770
<20-8,BECKETT>都在耍你
<20-8,BECKETT>this whole time.

543
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,550
<20-9,CASTLE>有意思  详细说一下吧
<20-9,CASTLE>Interesting. Can you elaborate?

544
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:43,050
<20-10,BECKETT>安其罗不是她手下第一个亡魂了  她以前也杀过人
<20-10,BECKETT>Angelo is not her first victim. She's done this before.

545
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:44,770
<20-10,BECKETT>她有一个封存的少年犯罪档案
<20-10,BECKETT>She has a sealed juvie record

546
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:47,850
<20-10,BECKETT>记录在原名之下  艾玛·琼斯
<20-10,BECKETT>under her original name -- Emma Jones.

547
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,250
<20-12,BECKETT>16岁时  她杀了寄养家的兄弟
<20-12,BECKETT>When she was 16, she killed her foster brother--

548
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:52,320
<20-12,BECKETT>比利·考斯
<20-12,BECKETT>Billy Koss.

549
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,510
<20-12,BECKETT>显然  她喝醉了
<20-12,BECKETT>Apparently, she got drunk,

550
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:55,390
<20-12,BECKETT>把他引到地下室
<20-12,BECKETT>lured him into their basement,

551
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:57,140
<20-12,BECKETT>然后用刀刺死了他
<20-12,BECKETT>and then stabbed him with a knife.

552
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:58,980
<20-13,CASTLE>那真是巧了
<20-13,CASTLE>Well, that's a coincidence.

553
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,730
<20-13,CASTLE>也表明了她的惯用手法  卡塞尔
<20-13,CASTLE>Also known as an M.O. Castle,

554
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:03,000
<20-14,BECKETT>她就是这么杀死安其罗的
<20-14,BECKETT>It's exactly what she did to Angelo.

555
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,440
<20-14,BECKETT>她情绪不稳定  你得赶快离开那里  马上
<20-14,BECKETT>She's unstable. You need to get out of there--now.

556
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:10,630
<20-15,EMMA>什么都别说
<20-15,EMMA>Don't say another word.

557
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,040
<20-15,EMMA>挂掉
<20-15,EMMA>Hang up.

558
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:15,920
<20-16,EMMA>她把比利·考斯的事告诉你了  是不是
<20-16,EMMA>She told you about Billy Koss, didn't she?

559
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:22,290
<21-1,CASTLE>-听着  艾玛  -退后
<21-1,CASTLE>-Look, Emma... - Back up!

560
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:26,200
<21-2,EMMA>我不是杀人犯
<21-2,EMMA>I am not a murderer.

561
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:27,870
<21-3,CASTLE>但你却拿枪指着我
<21-3,CASTLE>Says the lady pointing a gun at me.

562
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:30,380
<21-4,EMMA>你们不该查比利·考斯的案子的
<21-4,EMMA>You weren't supposed to find out about Billy Koss.

563
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,520
<21-4,EMMA>如果警察想查就查
<21-4,EMMA>I mean, what is the point of a sealed record

564
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,970
<21-4,EMMA>那么封存档案有什么意义啊
<21-4,EMMA>when the cops can open it whenever they feel like it?!

565
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:36,290
<21-5,CASTLE>他们肯定先拿到了传票
<21-5,CASTLE>I'm sure they got a subpoena first.

566
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:37,960
<21-6,EMMA>肯定也会对那些描述我的形容词
<21-6,EMMA>And I'm sure they all had a laugh

567
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,590
<21-6,EMMA>拿来说笑  对吧
<21-6,EMMA>off all the adjectives describing me, right?

568
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:44,980
<21-6,EMMA>狂躁症  情感两极化  暴力  杀人犯
<21-6,EMMA>Manic. Bipolar. Violent. Murderer!

569
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:45,870
<21-7,CASTLE>我不是要较真
<21-7,CASTLE>Well, not to be a stickler,

570
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:47,940
<21-7,CASTLE>但"杀人犯"不是形容词
<21-7,CASTLE>but "murderer" isn't an adjective.

571
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:50,040
<21-8,EMMA>-我不是白痴  -抱歉
<21-8,EMMA>- I'm not an idiot. - Sorry.

572
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:51,790
<21-9,CASTLE>我紧张的时候会挖苦别人
<21-9,CASTLE>I just get sarcastic when I'm nervous.

573
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:53,210
<21-10,EMMA>我不是在说这个
<21-10,EMMA>That's not what I was talking about.

574
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:55,120
<21-10,EMMA>我知道你会怎么想
<21-10,EMMA>Look, I knew what you were going to think.

575
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:59,170
<21-10,EMMA>两起命案  同样的犯罪手法
<21-10,EMMA>Two deaths happening the exact same way?

576
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:02,050
<21-10,EMMA>所以我才没告诉你  但我是清白的
<21-10,EMMA>That's why I didn't tell you. But I am innocent!

577
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,690
<21-10,EMMA>我没杀安其罗  我没有
<21-10,EMMA>I didn't kill Angelo. I didn't!

578
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:07,420
<21-11,CASTLE>如果这是真的  艾玛  你想让我帮你
<21-11,CASTLE>If that's true, Emma, and you want me to help you,

579
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:09,730
<21-11,CASTLE>就把一切都告诉我
<21-11,CASTLE>you have to tell me everything.

580
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:23,460
<21-12,EMMA>我16岁的时候
<21-12,EMMA>When I was 16,

581
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,660
<21-12,EMMA>被送到这家寄养家庭
<21-12,EMMA>I was sent to this foster home.

582
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,320
<21-12,EMMA>有一对双胞胎孤儿住在那儿
<21-12,EMMA>Twin orphans lived there--

583
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,660
<21-12,EMMA>考斯兄弟
<21-12,EMMA>The Koss brothers.

584
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:33,590
<21-12,EMMA>沃伦和比利
<21-12,EMMA>Warren and Billy.

585
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,010
<21-13,CASTLE>发生了什么
<21-13,CASTLE>What happened?

586
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,640
<21-14,EMMA>他们两个欺负了我好几周
<21-14,EMMA>Those two bullied me for weeks.

587
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,360
<21-14,EMMA>寄养家父母要出去赚钱
<21-14,EMMA>Foster parents were in it for the money,

588
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,060
<21-14,EMMA>所以他们不关心
<21-14,EMMA>so they didn't care.

589
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:46,680
<21-14,EMMA>但后来有一天  双胞胎
<21-14,EMMA>But then one day, the twins

590
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:48,390
<21-14,EMMA>突然对我很好
<21-14,EMMA>were nice to me all of a sudden.

591
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:52,040
<21-14,EMMA>我就以为他们
<21-14,EMMA>And I thought they, um...

592
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:56,340
<21-14,EMMA>我以为他们终于接受我了
<21-14,EMMA>I thought they'd finally accepted me, you know?

593
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:58,140
<21-14,EMMA>于是我们
<21-14,EMMA>So we...

594
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:00,920
<21-14,EMMA>一起去了地下室
<21-14,EMMA>we went down to the basement.

595
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,290
<21-14,EMMA>我们喝了烈酒  然后...
<21-14,EMMA>We drank schnapps, and then...

596
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:08,320
<21-14,EMMA>比利拿刀刺向我
<21-14,EMMA>Billy pulled a knife on me.

597
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:10,930
<21-16,EMMA>我只是想阻止他
<21-16,EMMA>I was just trying to stop him.

598
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:14,520
<21-18,EMMA>不是故意要...
<21-18,EMMA>I didn't mean to...

599
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,140
<21-20,EMMA>后来警察来了
<21-20,EMMA>And then when the cops came...

600
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:20,960
<21-22,EMMA>沃伦撒了谎
<21-22,EMMA>Warren lied.

601
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,140
<21-14,EMMA>他说是我拿刀刺他们
<21-14,EMMA>He said I pulled the knife on them,

602
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:25,770
<21-14,EMMA>警察相信了他的话
<21-14,EMMA>And they just--they just took him at his word.

603
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,630
<21-15,CASTLE>所以你讨厌警察
<21-15,CASTLE>Which is why you hate cops.

604
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,620
<21-16,EMMA>但我没杀安其罗
<21-16,EMMA>But I didn't kill Angelo.

605
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:34,460
<21-16,EMMA>我没有  你必须相信我
<21-16,EMMA>I didn't. You have to believe me.

606
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,130
<21-17,CASTLE>艾玛  我相信你
<21-17,CASTLE>I do, Emma. I believe you.

607
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,010
<21-17,CASTLE>但为什么安其罗和比利的死
<21-17,CASTLE>But why were Angelo and Billy's deaths

608
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:44,630
<21-17,CASTLE>布置得一模一样呢
<21-17,CASTLE>staged exactly the same way?

609
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,350
<21-18,EMMA>我不知道  我不知道
<21-18,EMMA>I have no idea. I don't know.

610
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:48,730
<21-19,CASTLE>一定是了解你过去的人做的
<21-19,CASTLE>It has to be someone who knew something about your past.

611
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:52,230
<21-20,EMMA>-是啊  我猜也是  -那是谁呢
<21-20,EMMA>- Yeah. I mean, I guess so. - But who?

612
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,310
<21-20,EMMA>沃伦·考斯
<21-20,EMMA>Warren Koss.

613
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:57,810
<21-21,CASTLE>有什么方法能比杀死你男友
<21-21,CASTLE>What better way to get revenge for the death of his brother

614
00:25:57,810 --> 00:25:59,430
<21-21,CASTLE>然后嫁祸给你
<21-21,CASTLE>than by killing your boyfriend

615
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:00,660
<21-21,CASTLE>更能为兄报仇的呢
<21-21,CASTLE>And pinning the murder on you?

616
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,660
<21-22,EMMA>不是沃伦
<21-22,EMMA>No, it's not Warren.

617
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:03,040
<21-22,EMMA>沃伦因为故意伤人
<21-22,EMMA>Warren's doing eight years

618
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,940
<21-22,EMMA>在新新监狱服刑8年
<21-22,EMMA>up in sing sing for assault.

619
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:06,880
<21-23,CASTLE>-你一直关注着他  -当然
<21-23,CASTLE>- You kept track of him? - Of course.

620
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,520
<21-24,EMMA>我是因为他才改名的
<21-24,EMMA>He's the reason why I changed my name.

621
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,540
<21-24,EMMA>我非常小心
<21-24,EMMA>I mean, I have been really careful

622
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:12,070
<21-24,EMMA>避开沃伦的生活范围
<21-24,EMMA>about staying off of Warren's radar

623
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,920
<21-24,EMMA>自从他在庭上指证我杀人之后
<21-24,EMMA>ever since he testified against me in court.

624
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,050
<21-24,EMMA>差点让我坐一辈子牢
<21-24,EMMA>He almost got me thrown in prison for life.

625
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:17,680
<21-24,EMMA>要不是那些
<21-24,EMMA>If it wasn't for the sisters

626
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,560
<21-25,CASTLE>圣海伦娜儿童之家的修女们  我...
<21-25,CASTLE>Of St. Helena's home for children, I--

627
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,000
<21-25,CASTLE>慢着  再说一遍
<21-25,CASTLE>Whoa, whoa. Go back.

628
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,530
<21-25,CASTLE>-圣海伦娜儿童之家  在哪  -在扬克斯[纽约郊区]
<21-25,CASTLE>- St. Helena's home for children--where is that? - In Yonkers.

629
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:27,050
<21-27,CASTLE>我们在安其罗的外套里
<21-27,CASTLE>The note we found in Angelo's jacket

630
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:30,200
<21-27,CASTLE>发现写着"S.H.在锯木厂河路上"的便笺
<21-27,CASTLE>said "S.H. off Saw Mill River parkway."

631
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:32,640
<21-27,CASTLE>S.H.指的是圣海伦娜
<21-27,CASTLE>"S.H." has to be St. Helena's.

632
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,700
<21-27,CASTLE>扬克斯就在锯木厂河路上
<21-27,CASTLE>Yonkers is off Saw Mill River parkway.

633
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:37,870
<21-27,CASTLE>圣海伦娜跟这个联系到一块儿了
<21-27,CASTLE>Somehow St. Helena's is connected to this.

634
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:41,100
<21-28,EMMA>但是怎么会  我好久没回那里了
<21-28,EMMA>But I--how? I mean, I haven't been back there in years.

635
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,940
<22-1,RYAN>我跟圣海伦娜的弗兰西斯修女联系过了
<22-1,RYAN>I spoke with sister Frances at St. Helena's.

636
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:47,150
<22-1,RYAN>她说三天前夜里曾有一次非法闯入
<22-1,RYAN>She said that there was a break-in three nights ago.

637
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:49,650
<22-2,ESPOSITO>她们用的是兰柯-4700警报器
<22-2,ESPOSITO>And they have a Ramco-4700 alarm.

638
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:53,570
<22-3,CASTLE>兰柯-4700  安其罗车里有它的说明书
<22-3,CASTLE>Ramco-4700. That's the manual Angelo had in his car.

639
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,420
<22-4,EMMA>他为什么要闯入我之前住的孤儿院
<22-4,EMMA>Why would he break into my old orphanage?

640
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:57,250
<22-5,RYAN>我们有个靠谱的想法
<22-5,RYAN>We have a pretty good idea.

641
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:58,960
<22-5,RYAN>弗兰西斯修女检查过了档案室
<22-5,RYAN>Sister Frances checked the records room.

642
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,530
<22-5,RYAN>艾玛密封的收养文件不见了
<22-5,RYAN>And Emma's sealed foster care file is missing.

643
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:03,260
<23-1,ESPOSITO>看来是安其罗偷走的
<23-1,ESPOSITO>Looks like Angelo stole it.

644
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:05,780
<23-3,CASTLE>-他为什么这么做  -发现关于你的什么事
<23-3,CASTLE>- Why would he do that? - To find out something about you?

645
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:07,720
<23-4,EMMA>不  我已经告诉他我的一切了
<23-4,EMMA>No, I already told him everything about me.

646
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:12,000
<23-4,EMMA>天啊
<23-4,EMMA>Oh, god.

647
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:14,980
<23-5,CASTLE>回头打给你们  伙计们
<23-5,CASTLE>Guys, let me call you back.

648
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:18,490
<23-5,CASTLE>你知道原因了
<23-5,CASTLE>You figured it out?

649
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:23,420
<23-6,EMMA>我一出生  就被送去领养了
<23-6,EMMA>I was given up for adoption when I was born.

650
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,100
<23-6,EMMA>安其罗知道我一直想弄清楚自己的身世
<23-6,EMMA>Angelo knew I always wanted to find out where I came from.

651
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,500
<23-7,CASTLE>而那个文件有你的收养信息
<23-7,CASTLE>And that file had your adoption papers

652
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,530
<23-7,CASTLE>包括你亲生父母的名字
<23-7,CASTLE>with your birth parents' names.

653
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,320
<23-8,EMMA>之前我试图拿到文件
<23-8,EMMA>I tried to get 'em in the past,

654
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:36,560
<23-8,EMMA>但是...  文件已经被封存
<23-8,EMMA>but... they were sealed.

655
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:39,210
<23-9,CASTLE>这就是安其罗今晚想要给你的惊喜
<23-9,CASTLE>That's the surprise Angelo was gonna give you tonight...

656
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,790
<23-9,CASTLE>在你的生日晚餐上
<23-9,CASTLE>At your birthday dinner.

657
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:44,130
<23-9,CASTLE>礼物就是知道你的亲生父母是谁
<23-9,CASTLE>The gift of knowing who your real parents are.

658
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,260
<23-9,CASTLE>小心

675
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,860
<25-13,BECKETT>被每秒一千尺速度运行的子弹射到不疼才怪
<25-13,BECKETT>traveling at 1,000 feet per second's gonna sting a bit.

<26-1,RYAN>她往你胸部射了一枪
<26-1,RYAN>She shot you in the chest,

681
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:47,990
<26-1,RYAN>你还认为她是无辜的
<26-1,RYAN>and you still think she's innocent?

682
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:49,460
<26-2,CASTLE>不  她射了我一枪
<26-2,CASTLE>No, she shot me in the chest,

683
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,930
<26-2,CASTLE>现在我知道她是无辜的了
<26-2,CASTLE>and now I know she's innocent.

684
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:52,200
<26-3,CASTLE>谢谢  你看不出来吗
<26-3,CASTLE>Thank you. Don't you see?

685
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,060
<26-3,CASTLE>就像避弹衣保护我一样
<26-3,CASTLE>Just like that vest protected me,

686
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,670
<26-3,CASTLE>艾玛的收养文件
<26-3,CASTLE>Emma's adoption papers--

687
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:57,400
<26-3,CASTLE>保护着凶手
<26-3,CASTLE>they're protecting the killer.

688
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,800
<26-4,ESPOSITO>那完全说不通
<26-4,ESPOSITO>You know that made no sense, right?

689
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:02,230
<26-5,BECKETT>我想卡塞尔是想说
<26-5,BECKETT>I-I think what Castle is suggesting

690
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,440
<26-5,BECKETT>艾玛的亲生父母
<26-5,BECKETT>is that one of Emma's birth parents

691
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:05,810
<26-5,BECKETT>也许就是幕后主使
<26-5,BECKETT>may be behind all of this.

692
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:07,900
<26-6,CASTLE>那也是安其罗拿走记录的原因
<26-6,CASTLE>That's why Angelo took those records--

693
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:10,840
<26-6,CASTLE>找到她的亲生父母  如果他找到了其中之一呢
<26-6,CASTLE>to find her birth parents. What if he found one of them?

695
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,470
<26-6,CASTLE>也许就住在斯卡斯戴尔眺望路上
<26-6,CASTLE>Perhaps living on Overlook Road in Scarsdale.

696
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:16,790
<26-6,CASTLE>如果她的亲生父母不想被找到呢
<26-6,CASTLE>But what if that birth parent didn't want to be found?

697
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:19,130
<26-6,CASTLE>如果艾玛知道真相对他们来说是个威胁呢
<26-6,CASTLE>What if Emma learning the truth was a threat somehow?

698
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:21,020
<26-7,RYAN>卡塞尔  这只是猜测而已
<26-7,RYAN>Castle, that's just speculation.

699
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:23,400
<26-7,RYAN>如果你是对的  我们可能永远不会知道
<26-7,RYAN>And if you're right, we'll probably never know.

700
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,850
<26-7,RYAN>凶手现在很有可能已经毁掉了记录
<26-7,RYAN>The killer's most likely destroyed the records by now.

701
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:28,190
<26-8,ESPOSITO>除非  安其罗藏了起来
<26-8,ESPOSITO>Unless... Angelo hid them.

702
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:29,960
<26-8,ESPOSITO>我是说  这本应是个惊喜
<26-8,ESPOSITO>I mean, they were supposed to be a surprise.

703
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:32,470
<26-9,BECKETT>再去安其罗的住所  我们要再搜查一遍
<26-9,BECKETT>Head back to Angelo's place. We need to search it again.

704
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:37,730
<26-10,ESPOSITO>你有意识到
<26-10,ESPOSITO>You are aware that you don't actually

705
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,320
<26-10,ESPOSITO>你已经不是警察了  对吧
<26-10,ESPOSITO>work here anymore, right?

706
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:42,540
<26-11,BECKETT>对不起  使唤习惯了
<26-11,BECKETT>I'm sorry. Old habits.

707
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,240
<26-12,ESPOSITO>好  我们会让苏利
<26-12,ESPOSITO>Okay. Uh, we'll grab Sully...

708
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,510
<26-12,ESPOSITO>再去搜查一遍  以防万一
<26-12,ESPOSITO>go check again, just in case.

709
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:49,540
<26-12,ESPOSITO>但不是因为你要求我这么做
<26-12,ESPOSITO>But not because you asked me to.

710
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,270
<26-12,ESPOSITO>是因为我正好要去...
<26-12,ESPOSITO>Okay. 'cause I was actually on my way to...

711
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:55,370
<26-13,BECKETT>好的  假设这是艾玛的生日礼物
<26-13,BECKETT>Okay. So let's suppose it is one of Emma's birth parents.

712
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:57,150
<26-13,BECKETT>如果安其罗被谋杀是为了诬陷
<26-13,BECKETT>If Angelo's murder was a setup,

713
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:59,720
<26-13,BECKETT>他们又怎么会知道如何布置呢
<26-13,BECKETT>then how would they know how to stage it?

714
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,120
<26-13,BECKETT>我是说  他们把她送去领养
<26-13,BECKETT>I mean, they gave her up for adoption,

715
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,030
<26-13,BECKETT>那他们怎么知道艾玛的暴力史
<26-13,BECKETT>so how would they know about Emma's violent history?

716
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:05,880
<26-14,CASTLE>-新闻报道  -不  我查过了
<26-14,CASTLE>-Newspaper articles. - No. I checked.

717
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,740
<26-15,RYAN>因为她当时还是未成年人  名字没对外公布
<26-15,RYAN>Because she was a minor, her name was withheld.

718
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,560
<26-16,BECKETT>那么凶手必须通过其他渠道拿到
<26-16,BECKETT>So then our killer had to have had access

719
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,730
<26-16,BECKETT>艾玛密封的青少年犯罪记录
<26-16,BECKETT>to Emma's sealed juvie records.

720
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:14,040
<26-17,CASTLE>这样的话  就需要传票
<26-17,CASTLE>And for that, you need a subpoena.

721
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,180
<26-18,RYAN>看来有人直接跳过这一步了
<26-18,RYAN>Looks like someone skipped that step.

722
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:21,350
<26-18,RYAN>艾玛的密封档案三天前被打开过
<26-18,RYAN>Emma's sealed records were opened three days ago.

723
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:22,330
<26-19,BECKETT>是谁打开的
<26-19,BECKETT>By who?

724
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,100
<27-1,RYAN>是朱丽安·卡特吗
<27-1,RYAN>Julian Carter?

725
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,720
<27-2,RYAN>你好  我是莱恩警探  这位是凯特·贝克特
<27-2,RYAN>Hi. I'm Detective Ryan. This is Kate Beckett.

726
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,990
<27-2,RYAN>我们是十二分局的  能否耽误你些时间
<27-2,RYAN>We're from the 12th. Do you have a second

727
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:31,470
<27-2,RYAN>帮助我们件事
<27-2,RYAN>to help us out with something?

728
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:32,660
<27-3,JULIAN>没问题  怎么了
<27-3,JULIAN>Sure. What's up?

729
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,600
<27-4,BECKETT>系统记录显示你打开了
<27-4,BECKETT>The system tagged you for opening a file

730
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,240
<27-4,BECKETT>艾玛·琼斯的文件
<27-4,BECKETT>of an Emma Jones.

731
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,550
<27-5,JULIAN>对  这就是我的工作
<27-5,JULIAN>Yeah. That's my job.

732
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:40,110
<27-5,JULIAN>打开文件  合上文件
<27-5,JULIAN>I open files, I close files.

733
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:42,090
<27-5,JULIAN>我正在归档文件
<27-5,JULIAN>Right now I'm filing files.

734
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,570
<27-6,JULIAN>有什么问题吗
<27-6,JULIAN>Is there a problem?

735
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:48,470
<27-7,BECKETT>恐怕是的  那是青少年犯罪文件
<27-7,BECKETT>I'm afraid so. You see, it was a juvie file,

736
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:51,250
<27-7,BECKETT>而你没经法庭批准打开了
<27-7,BECKETT>and you didn't have the court's permission to unseal it.

737
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:54,620
<27-8,JULIAN>我有时候忘了注销我的电脑
<27-8,JULIAN>Well, I... sometimes forget to log out of my computer,

738
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,870
<27-8,JULIAN>-也许是有人  -别狡辩了
<27-8,JULIAN>-so maybe somebody - just stop it.

739
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:58,950
<27-9,RYAN>你已经丢了饭碗  现在的问题是
<27-9,RYAN>You've already lost your job. Now the only question is

740
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:00,300
<27-9,RYAN>你是否也会失去自由
<27-9,RYAN>whether you're losing your freedom, too,

741
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,850
<27-9,RYAN>因为我们会以凶手从犯的罪名
<27-9,RYAN>because I'm about two seconds away from arresting you

742
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:05,170
<27-10,JULIAN>-将你逮捕  -等等  等等
<27-10,JULIAN>- for accessory to murder. - W-wait. Wait. Hold on.

743
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:07,760
<27-11,BECKETT>在他掏出手铐之前你最好先交代清楚
<27-11,BECKETT>You better start talking before he pulls out his cuffs.

744
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:11,920
<27-12,JULIAN>好的好的  我说
<27-12,JULIAN>Okay. Okay. Okay!

745
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:16,590
<27-12,JULIAN>有时候  我会把信息透露给一个律师
<27-12,JULIAN>From time to time, I slip information to a lawyer.

746
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:17,510
<27-13,RYAN>什么样的信息
<27-13,RYAN>What kind of information?

747
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:19,760
<27-14,JULIAN>犯罪档案  证人证词之类的
<27-14,JULIAN>Rap sheets, witness statements, things like that.

748
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,560
<27-15,BECKETT>那艾玛的事呢
<27-15,BECKETT>What about with Emma?

749
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,520
<27-16,JULIAN>三天之前  那个律师打电话给我
<27-16,JULIAN>Three days ago, the lawyer called,

750
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,180
<27-16,JULIAN>说他的一个客户要所有
<27-16,JULIAN>Said a client wanted all the information

751
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:26,670
<27-16,JULIAN>关于艾玛·里格斯的警方信息
<27-16,JULIAN>that the police had on Emma Riggs.

752
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,750
<27-17,BECKETT>-有什么目的  -他没说
<27-17,BECKETT>- What for? - He didn't say.

753
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:31,000
<27-18,JULIAN>但当我告诉他艾玛有青少年犯罪文件
<27-18,JULIAN>But when I told him that Emma had a juvie file

754
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,630
<27-18,JULIAN>不过归在不同的姓氏之下
<27-18,JULIAN>under a different last name,

755
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:35,030
<27-18,JULIAN>他又额外付给我一千美元打开文件
<27-18,JULIAN>He paid me an extra grand to unseal it.

756
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,280
<27-19,RYAN>那个律师叫什么名字
<27-19,RYAN>What's the name of this lawyer?

757
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:39,760
<28-1,RAYMOND VANCE>不  我和法官约好了吃午餐
<28-1,RAYMOND VANCE>No, I'm having breakfast with the judge--

758
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,290
<28-2,RYAN>你好  文斯先生  我是莱恩警探
<28-2,RYAN>Hi, Mr. Vance. I'm Detective Ryan.

759
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:43,240
<28-3,VANCE>他是一个朋友的朋友
<28-3,VANCE>Uh, he's a friend of a friend.

760
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:46,780
<28-4,VANCE>对  而且...
<28-4,VANCE>Yeah. And then--

761
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:48,400
<28-5,RYAN>他会给你回电话的
<28-5,RYAN>He's gonna need to call you back.

762
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:51,040
<28-6,VANCE>-你脑子有毛病吗  -事实上  文斯先生
<28-6,VANCE>- What is your problem? - Actually, Mr. Vance,

763
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:55,850
<28-8,VANCE>-有毛病的是你  -好吧  洗耳恭听
<28-8,VANCE>- You are. - Okay. I'm listening.

764
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:58,300
<28-9,RYAN>你受一名客户所托  通过贿赂  查阅了
<28-9,RYAN>On behalf of a client, you paid to have

765
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,800
<28-9,RYAN>艾玛·里格斯的少年犯罪记录
<28-9,RYAN>Emma Riggs' juvenile records unsealed.

766
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:04,310
<28-10,VANCE>购买封存警方文件是违法的
<28-10,VANCE>Buying secured police files is illegal...

767
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,760
<28-10,VANCE>而且会吊销律师资格证  我是绝不会做这种事的
<28-10,VANCE>and grounds for disbarment. I would never do that.

768
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:09,890
<28-11,RYAN>是吗  我可是有一位纽约警局文职人员
<28-11,RYAN>Really? Because I have an N.Y.P.D. civilian employee

769
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:12,540
<28-11,RYAN>他的说辞与你刚好相反  并且他愿意作证
<28-11,RYAN>who begs to differ. He's willing to testify to it.

770
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:15,890
<28-12,VANCE>警探  我不是惟利是图的小律师
<28-12,VANCE>Detective, I'm not some ambulance chaser.

771
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:19,160
<28-12,VANCE>我可是柯帕杨律师事务所受人尊敬的律师
<28-12,VANCE>I'm a respected attorney at Kirk Patrick & Young.

772
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,630
<28-12,VANCE>所以除非你能拿出什么实质证据
<28-12,VANCE>So unless you have any real proof of those claims,

773
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:23,690
<28-12,VANCE>不然你就别指望任何法庭
<28-12,VANCE>good luck getting any court to take the word

774
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:26,460
<28-12,VANCE>会听信一个渎职的文职人员的证词
<28-12,VANCE>of a disgraced civilian employee.

775
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:31,540
<28-13,RYAN>文斯先生  你的客户现在卷入了一起谋杀案
<28-13,RYAN>Mr. Vance, you have a client who's mixed up in a homicide.

776
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:34,420
<28-13,RYAN>你拒绝透露他的姓名  就是妨碍司法公正
<28-13,RYAN>By withholding their name, you're obstructing justice.

777
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:37,600
<28-14,VANCE>就算我想帮你  我也不能把客户的姓名透露给你
<28-14,VANCE>Even if I wanted to, I can't disclose my client's name.

778
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,760
<28-14,VANCE>你也清楚地知道  律师和客户之间是有保密协议的
<28-14,VANCE>As you're well aware, that falls under privileged information.

779
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:48,590
<29-2,BECKETT>别跟我说律师那边碰壁了
<29-2,BECKETT>Oh, don't tell me we struck out on the lawyer.

780
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:50,110
<29-3,RYAN>恐怕是的
<29-3,RYAN>Yeah, I'm afraid so.

781
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:51,410
<29-4,CASTLE>那现在怎么办
<29-4,CASTLE>So what do we do now?

782
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,010
<29-5,CASTLE>拜托  如果我们不想点办法的话
<29-5,CASTLE>Come on, you guys. If we don't figure this out,

783
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:55,960
<29-5,CASTLE>艾玛就要在监狱里度过余生了
<29-5,CASTLE>Emma is going away for life.

784
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:59,110
<29-5,CASTLE>她的威士忌酒瓶子怎么样了  检验结果出来了吗
<29-5,CASTLE>What about her scotch bottle? Did the lab report come back?

785
00:32:59,110 --> 00:32:59,910
<29-6,RYAN>蕾妮刚刚发过信息来
<29-6,RYAN>Lanie just texted.

786
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:03,290
<29-6,RYAN>没有找到任何毒品或是镇定剂的残留
<29-6,RYAN>There's no evidence of any drugs or sedatives.

787
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:05,110
<29-6,RYAN>抱歉  不过看来我们走投无路了
<29-6,RYAN>I'm sorry. It looks like we're dead in the water.

788
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:07,880
<29-7,ESPOSITO>不  此言差矣  猜猜我们在安其罗的公寓里找到了什么
<29-7,ESPOSITO>No. Far from it. Guess what we found in Angelo's apartment.

789
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,280

<29-18,ESPOSITO>眺望路上的房子比起来哪个更大
<29-18,ESPOSITO>compares to his big house on Overlook Road in Scarsdale.

813
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:12,730
<30-4,CASTLE>就因为他跟你的上司是好基友
<30-4,CASTLE>So because he has a standing tee time with your boss,

814
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:14,330
<30-4,CASTLE>他就可以逃脱谋杀罪名吗

861
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:19,210

<32-13,RYAN>我只能想到一个原因
<32-13,RYAN>Now I can only think of one reason

900
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:44,010
<32-13,RYAN>就是你闯入他的公寓
<32-13,RYAN>that you'd break into in his, uh, apartment,

901
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:47,280
<32-13,RYAN>想找到艾玛的收养记录
<32-13,RYAN>and that would be to find Emma's adoption records

902
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,130
<32-13,RYAN>来掩盖与你家有关的一切联系
<32-13,RYAN>to cover up any link back to your family.

903
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:51,840
<32-14,ESPOSITO>通过录像所示
<32-14,ESPOSITO>Now according to this video,

904
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:53,220
<32-14,ESPOSITO>你进到了公寓里
<32-14,ESPOSITO>you were inside that apartment

905
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:56,010
<32-14,ESPOSITO>找了足足两个小时
<32-14,ESPOSITO>searching for a good two hours.

906
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,300
<32-14,ESPOSITO>糟透了
<32-14,ESPOSITO>Damn...

907
00:37:57,570 --> 00:37:59,250
<32-14,ESPOSITO>你竟然没想到去看看
<32-14,ESPOSITO>You didn't think to look...

908
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:01,230
<32-14,ESPOSITO>包好送给艾玛的礼物
<32-14,ESPOSITO>tt the wrapped gift for Emma,

909
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:02,540
<32-14,ESPOSITO>没想到吧
<32-14,ESPOSITO>Did you?

910
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:06,100
<32-15,RYAN>她的收养记录
<32-15,RYAN>Her adoption records.

911
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,780
<32-15,RYAN>直到那时  你的计划一切顺利
<32-15,RYAN>Up until then, your plan was going perfectly.

912
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:10,470
<32-15,RYAN>你给艾玛的威士忌里面注入了麻醉药
<32-15,RYAN>You spiked Emma's scotch bottle with knockout drops

913
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:11,800
<32-15,RYAN>然后换成了空瓶子
<32-15,RYAN>and you swapped it out for an empty one.

914
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,490
<32-15,RYAN>这招挺聪明
<32-15,RYAN>Th-that was pretty clever.

915
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:16,980
<32-16,ESPOSITO>但没把有药的瓶子从家里扔掉就有点傻了
<32-16,ESPOSITO>But not so clever to throw the dosed bottle away at your house.

916
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,280
<32-16,ESPOSITO>对  我们从你的垃圾箱里找到了瓶子
<32-16,ESPOSITO>Yeah. We found the bottle in your recycle bin.

917
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,340
<32-16,ESPOSITO>检测出了水合氯醛
<32-16,ESPOSITO>It tested positive for chloral hydrate.

918
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,830
<32-17,ESPOSITO>糟透了  又一次
<32-17,ESPOSITO>Oops again.

919
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:25,740
<32-18,VANCE>这都是间接证据
<32-18,VANCE>All of this is circumstantial.

920
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:27,400
<32-18,VANCE>我是说  我的动机是什么
<32-18,VANCE>I mean, what could possibly be my motive?

921
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,540
<32-19,RYAN>你岳父帮我想出来了
<32-19,RYAN>Oh, your father-in-law helped us out with that one.

922
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,310
<32-19,RYAN>你的律师事务所代理斯托克斯家族
<32-19,RYAN>Your law firm represents the Stokeses.

923
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:32,930
<32-19,RYAN>你知道他们要将
<32-19,RYAN>Now you knew that they were about to transfer

924
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:34,400
<32-19,RYAN>一大部分财产转到女儿的信托基金里
<32-19,RYAN>a majority of their wealth into a trust

925
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,770
<32-19,RYAN>也就是你的妻子
<32-19,RYAN>for their daughter-- your wife.

926
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:39,330
<32-20,ESPOSITO>你不想要什么小孤儿安妮[音乐剧人物]
<32-20,ESPOSITO>And you didn't want some little orphan Annie

927
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:41,880
<32-20,ESPOSITO>忽然出现卷走一半
<32-20,ESPOSITO>coming around, making a claim for half.

928
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:44,800
<32-21,RYAN>所以才会决定杀掉知道真相的人
<32-21,RYAN>That's when you decided to kill the one man who knew the truth

929
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:47,380
<32-21,RYAN>再嫁祸到这个不为人所知的继承人身上
<32-21,RYAN>and frame it on the unknowing heir.

930
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:51,170
<32-22,ESPOSITO>只有一点我们不太确定
<32-22,ESPOSITO>There's just one thing that we're not so sure about.

931
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:52,830
<32-23,RYAN>你打算协议认罪
<32-23,RYAN>Are you gonna make a deal and plea to murder?

932
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,610
<32-23,RYAN>还是冒险上庭
<32-23,RYAN>or you gonna take your chances in court?

933
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:57,170
<32-24,ESPOSITO>律师有自己的律师吗
<32-24,ESPOSITO>Do lawyers have lawyers?

934
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:01,310
<33-1,CASTLE>艾玛

964
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:55,150

<35-1,CASTLE>我弄这件防弹衣时你们还嘲笑过我
<35-1,CASTLE>when I had this made four years ago.

966
00:40:57,910 --> 00:40:59,090
<35-1,CASTLE>我会把它裱起来了

<35-2,RYAN>你的头号粉丝要杀你
<35-2,RYAN>Hey, what does it say about your writing

968
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:02,290
<35-2,RYAN>它又能说明你的作品怎么样呢
<35-2,RYAN>when your number-one fan tries to kill you?

969
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,430
<35-3,CASTLE>这是个意外

971
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:07,430
<35-5,CASTLE>不过好的一面就是你们的签名版
<35-5,CASTLE>But on the bright side, your autographed copies

972
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:09,920
<35-5,CASTLE>《致命希特》就更值钱了
<35-5,CASTLE>of "Deadly Heat" would be worth way more.

973
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:12,380
<35-7,CASTLE>-一点都不好笑  卡塞尔  -有点好笑
<35-7,CASTLE>- Not funny, Castle. - Little bit funny.
