00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:06,910
<1-10,BECKETT>她俩做了饭啊  你不会真让她们洗碗吧
<1-10,BECKETT>You are not letting them do dishes after they just cooked.

<1-11,CASTLE>她们喜欢啊
<1-11,CASTLE>They want to.

00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:10,980
<1-12,BECKETT>"我失踪两个月"当做资本  讨好处  是吧
<1-12,BECKETT>"I've been missing for two months thing," aren't you?

26
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,220
<1-13,CASTLE>她们很高兴我能回来
<1-13,CASTLE>They are glad to have me back,

28
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:15,820
<1-13,CASTLE>如果对我关照得无微不至能让她们开心
<1-13,CASTLE>and if fussing over me makes them happy...

<1-13,CASTLE>那就偷乐嘛
<1-13,CASTLE>Enjoy it.

30
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,750
<1-13,CASTLE>你也该尝尝这个
<1-13,CASTLE>Like you ought to be enjoying this

31
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,930
<1-13,CASTLE>薯片软糖冰淇淋圣代
<1-13,CASTLE>potato chip fudge ice cream sundae.

32
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:24,060
<1-13,CASTLE>有种又咸又甜的味道
<1-13,CASTLE>It's got that whole salty/sweet thing going on.

33
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,960
<1-13,CASTLE>跟我一样
<1-13,CASTLE>It's just... just like me.

<1-15,CASTLE>I'll... I'll get yeah. I'll get it. Mm.

00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,150
<1-16,CASTLE>贝克特的电话
<1-16,CASTLE>Beckett's phone.

38
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,600
<2-1,BECKETT>我知道你才回来几周
<2-1,BECKETT>Look, I know that you've only been back

39
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,380
<2-1,BECKETT>我们都还在适应这一点
<2-1,BECKETT>for a few weeks, and we're all still trying to process it,

40
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:52,310
<2-1,BECKETT>但我得说
<2-1,BECKETT>but I gotta say,

41
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,600
<2-1,BECKETT>阿丽克西斯对你那么关照
<2-1,BECKETT>Alexis waiting on you hand and foot...

42
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,130
<2-1,BECKETT>实在好怪
<2-1,BECKETT>it's just it's a little odd.

43
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:58,720
<2-2,CASTLE>你知道什么才叫怪吗
<2-2,CASTLE>Hey, you know what's really odd?

44
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,730
<2-2,CASTLE>冰淇淋车开到这么荒无人烟的地方
<2-2,CASTLE>Ice cream truck in the middle of nowhere.

45
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,970
<2-2,CASTLE>这里才没有小孩会来排队买糖呢
<2-2,CASTLE>There's no kids lining up to buy bomb pops around here.

46
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:05,030
<2-3,BECKETT>是啊  这里一定不是常规行车路线
<2-3,BECKETT>Yeah, this couldn't have been the driver's route.

47
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:07,090
<2-4,KEVIN RYAN>差远了  我刚刚跟冰淇淋车的
<2-4,KEVIN RYAN>Not even close. I just got off the phone

48
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:08,170
<2-4,KEVIN RYAN>车主通过电话
<2-4,KEVIN RYAN>with the owner of the ice cream truck...

49
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:09,550
<2-4,KEVIN RYAN>谢尔盖·维托什金
<2-4,KEVIN RYAN>Sergei Vetotchkin.

50
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:12,520
<2-4,KEVIN RYAN>死者是他儿子  安东  22岁
<2-4,KEVIN RYAN>The victim is his son... Anton, 22.

51
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,590
<2-4,KEVIN RYAN>早上5点发现他死在车座上
<2-4,KEVIN RYAN>They found him behind the wheel around 5:00 p.m.

52
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,160
<2-5,CASTLE>这世上没有神圣的东西了吗
<2-5,CASTLE>Is nothing sacred?

53
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,770
<2-5,CASTLE>谁会杀冰淇淋车售货员啊
<2-5,CASTLE>I mean, who kills an ice cream man,

54
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,640
<2-5,CASTLE>这可是童真的象征
<2-5,CASTLE>a symbol of childhood innocence?

55
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,310
<2-6,BECKETT>或许有人是想抢他钱
<2-6,BECKETT>Maybe someone wanted his money.

56
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:25,040
<2-7,RYAN>但是今天的收入都还在车上
<2-7,RYAN>Except that today's cash receipts were still in the van.

57
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:27,540
<2-8,LANIE PARISH>而且凶手是近距离开枪
<2-8,LANIE PARISH>And whoever did this shot him at close range.

58
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,600
<2-8,LANIE PARISH>胸口两处枪伤  有焦痕
<2-8,LANIE PARISH>Two G.S.W.s to the chest with powder burns.

59
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,420
<2-9,JAVIER ESPOSITO>我们认为凶手登上车
<2-9,JAVIER ESPOSITO>We figure the shooter boarded the truck

60
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,220
<2-9,JAVIER ESPOSITO>射死了安东  然后把他抬回座位里
<2-9,JAVIER ESPOSITO>and shot Anton, knocking him back into the shifter.

61
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,520
<2-9,JAVIER ESPOSITO>挂一档  车慢慢开到了这里
<2-9,JAVIER ESPOSITO>Went into first, and that's why the truck rolled here.

62
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,680
<2-9,JAVIER ESPOSITO>凶手大概从车后逃离的
<2-9,JAVIER ESPOSITO>Killer probably bolted out the back.

63
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,120
<2-10,BECKETT>有人看到了吗
<2-10,BECKETT>Anyone see it?

64
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,740
<2-11,RYAN>我们派了警员在这里找目击者
<2-11,RYAN>We got unis canvassing for witnesses,

65
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:45,340
<2-11,RYAN>但这一带没什么人
<2-11,RYAN>but it's not exactly an area where people hang out.

66
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,830
<2-12,BECKETT>那街头监控呢
<2-12,BECKETT>And what about street cams?

67
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:49,630
<2-13,RYAN>覆盖不全  如果有发现真是撞大运了
<2-13,RYAN>Coverage is spotty. We'll get really lucky if we get a hit.

68
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:52,070
<2-14,CASTLE>这孩子为什么来这一带啊
<2-14,CASTLE>What was this kid doing here in the first place?

69
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,190
<3-1,SERGEI VETOTCHKIN>我不知道我们儿子为什么去那一带
<3-1,SERGEI VETOTCHKIN>I don't know why our son would be in that neighborhood.

70
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,790
<3-1,SERGEI VETOTCHKIN>我们不是在那里做生意的
<3-1,SERGEI VETOTCHKIN>That's not where we do business.

71
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,720
<3-2,BECKETT>他有没有可能卷进什么
<3-2,BECKETT>Well, is it possible that he was involved

72
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,120
<3-2,BECKETT>危险的事中
<3-2,BECKETT>in something that would take him down there,

73
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,460
<3-2,BECKETT>才会去那边
<3-2,BECKETT>something dangerous?

74
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:04,810
<3-3,SERGEI>不  安东是个好孩子
<3-3,SERGEI>No. Anton was...A good boy.

75
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,310
<3-3,SERGEI>他从没惹过麻烦
<3-3,SERGEI>Never got in trouble.

76
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:08,690
<3-4,BECKETT>他行车线路上有什么麻烦吗
<3-4,BECKETT>Were there any troubles on his route?

77
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:11,200
<3-4,BECKETT>他生活中有什么异常吗
<3-4,BECKETT>Anything unusual going on in his life?

78
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:14,410
<3-5,BECKETT>他早下学回家了
<3-5,BECKETT>He came home early from school.

79
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:15,850
<3-5,BECKETT>他去哪所学校
<3-5,BECKETT>What school did he go to?

80
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:18,870
<3-5,BECKETT>他在布朗克斯的社区大学夜校
<3-5,BECKETT>He was taking night classes at the community college

81
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:21,370
<3-6,SERGEI>学平面设计
<3-6,SERGEI>in the Bronx for graphic design.

82
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:25,020
<3-6,SERGEI>他小时候在阿布哈兹就喜欢画画
<3-6,SERGEI>Since he was a boy in Abkhazia, he loved to draw.

83
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,790
<3-6,SERGEI>但昨晚  他从学校回来时
<3-6,SERGEI>But last night, he came back from class

84
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:31,540
<4-1,NATALIE BARNS>十分不安  似乎是出事了
<4-1,NATALIE BARNS>very upset, like something was wrong.

85
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:34,930
<4-1,NATALIE BARNS>是啊  当时的确不对劲
<4-1,NATALIE BARNS>Yeah, there was definitely something wrong.

86
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:37,520
<4-1,NATALIE BARNS>我从没见过安东那副样子
<4-1,NATALIE BARNS>I'd never seen Anton like that before.

87
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,540
<4-2,RYAN>能跟我们说说情况吗
<4-2,RYAN>Could you tell us what happened?

88
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,690
<4-3,NATALIE>我给了他一项课业任务
<4-3,NATALIE>Yeah, I'd given the class an assignment,

89
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:44,940
<4-3,NATALIE>安东像其他人一样在自己的工作台做设计
<4-3,NATALIE>and Anton was working at his station like everyone else,

90
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:48,790
<4-3,NATALIE>突然之间  他就开始颤抖  似乎很害怕
<4-3,NATALIE>and all of a sudden he started shaking like he was terrified.

91
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:49,950
<4-4,ESPOSITO>因为什么
<4-4,ESPOSITO>Because of what?

92
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,560
<4-5,NATALIE>不知道  他随后跑出了教室
<4-5,NATALIE>I don't know. He ran out of the room.

93
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,710
<4-5,NATALIE>但后来我在停车场
<4-5,NATALIE>But I saw him later in the parking lot

94
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,780
<4-5,NATALIE>看见他上了一个男人的车
<4-5,NATALIE>getting into a car with some guy.

95
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,380
<4-6,ESPOSITO>什么男人  能描述一下吗
<4-6,ESPOSITO>What guy? Can you describe him?

96
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,290
<4-7,NATALIE>太暗了
<4-7,NATALIE>No, it was too dark, but...

97
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:02,240
<4-7,NATALIE>我记得那辆车
<4-7,NATALIE>I-I do remember the car.

98
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,880
<4-7,NATALIE>亮绿色  老款凯美瑞
<4-7,NATALIE>It was bright green, an old Camry.

99
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,760
<4-8,ESPOSITO>你记得车牌吗
<4-8,ESPOSITO>Did you happen to get a license plate?

100
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:10,760
<4-9,NATALIE>我记得有3  E和K
<4-9,NATALIE>I-I got a 3, an "E," and a "K."

101
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:13,070
<4-10,RYAN>你说他是在工作台上突然发作
<4-10,RYAN>You said this all started when he was at his station.

102
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:15,030
<4-10,RYAN>能让我们看下他之前在忙些什么吗
<4-10,RYAN>Can we take a look at what he was working on?

103
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:18,280
<4-11,NATALIE>可以  我得先登录系统
<4-11,NATALIE>Uh, yeah. I have to log you into the system.

105
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,100
<4-12,NATALIE>怎么会这样
<4-12,NATALIE>What the - -

106
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,420
<4-12,NATALIE>他的文件夹不见了  而且他的
<4-12,NATALIE>His portfolio is gone and all his...

107
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:32,880
<4-12,NATALIE>作业也被删除了
<4-12,NATALIE>projects have been deleted.

108
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,030
<4-13,RYAN>是安东自己删除的吗  他为什么这么做
<4-13,RYAN>Did Anton delete them? Why would he do that?

109
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:36,590
<4-14,NATALIE>我不知道
<4-14,NATALIE>I have no idea.

110
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,470
<5-1,BECKETT>是鉴证组  我是莱恩
<5-1,BECKETT>It's C.S.U. Ryan.

111
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,060
<5-1,BECKETT>莱恩
<5-1,BECKETT>Ryan?

112
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,360
<5-2,RYAN>鉴证组有发现
<5-2,RYAN>Hey. C.S.U. got us a lead.

113
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:54,840
<5-2,RYAN>看这个柜子的关合状态
<5-2,RYAN>See how this cabinet door is open?

114
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,950
<5-2,RYAN>跟凶案现场的照片一样
<5-2,RYAN>Just like in these crime scene photos.

115
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:03,030
<5-3,BECKETT>嗯  是一样的  那又如何
<5-3,BECKETT>Okay. So?

116
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:06,040
<5-4,RYAN>当柜子右边的门关上的时候
<5-4,RYAN>So when the cabinet door is closed...

117
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,130
<5-5,BECKETT>左边原先被遮盖的地方也有血迹
<5-5,BECKETT>There's blood spatter on the door panel behind it.

118
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:11,930
<5-6,CASTLE>说明安东被杀的时候右边的门是关上的
<5-6,CASTLE>Which means the door was closed when Anton was shot.

119
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:15,040
<5-7,RYAN>对  现在你们再看门内面
<5-7,RYAN>Yep. Now, see this smear of blood

120
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,160
<5-7,RYAN>边缘处的血印
<5-7,RYAN>on the inside edge of the door?

121
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,000
<5-7,RYAN>鉴证组的人说这是手指印造成的
<5-7,RYAN>C.S.U. said that this came from a finger,

122
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,670
<5-7,RYAN>所以有人从柜子里面
<5-7,RYAN>So somebody grabbed the door from the inside,

123
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,130
<5-7,RYAN>打开了门
<5-7,RYAN>pulling it open.

124
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,580
<5-8,CASTLE>如果安东被杀时有人在里面
<5-8,CASTLE>If someone was in there when Anton was shot...

125
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,430
<5-9,BECKET>-他就看见了杀人凶手  -有目击证人
<5-9,BECKET>- They saw our killer. - A witness.

126
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,710
<5-11,RYAN>不是这么简单  我猜测目击证人也许是个孩子
<5-11,RYAN>Yeah, not only that, I think our witness might be a kid.

127
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:30,770
<5-12,BECKETT>你说什么
<5-12,BECKETT>What?

128
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,590
<5-13,RYAN>这是他落在柜子里的
<5-13,RYAN>They left that on the inside of the cabinet.

129
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:36,760
<5-13,RYAN>是一张班级郊游的许可征询信
<5-13,RYAN>It's a permission slip for a class trip.

130
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:37,940
<5-13,RYAN>无法从上面套取有用的指纹
<5-13,RYAN>No usable prints on it,

131
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:40,000
<5-13,RYAN>但的确是今天的日期
<5-13,RYAN>But it does have today's date.

133
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,600
<5-14,CASTLE>肯尼迪小学
<5-14,CASTLE>Kennedy elementary.

134
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,930
<5-14,CASTLE>离这不到一英里
<5-14,CASTLE>That's less than a mile away.

135
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:44,530
<5-14,CASTLE>假设下午放学后
<5-14,CASTLE>Assuming an afternoon dismissal,

136
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:46,460
<5-14,CASTLE>安东被杀时大概是下午5点
<5-14,CASTLE>Anton was shot at 5:00 p.m.

137
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:49,580
<5-15,BECKETT>安东被杀时一位肯尼迪小学的学生在货车里
<5-15,BECKETT>Someone from that school was in this van when Anton was killed.

138
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,700
<5-16,CASTLE>是鲁伊兹老师二年级班上的学生
<5-16,CASTLE>Someone from Miss Ruiz's second grade class.

139
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:58,540
<6-1,PRINCIPAL SILVA>我不敢相信是鲁伊兹老师班上的学生
<6-1,PRINCIPAL SILVA>I can't imagine it's one of Mrs. Ruiz's students.

140
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:00,470
<6-1,PRINCIPAL SILVA>他们怎么会自己跑到那去
<6-1,PRINCIPAL SILVA>Why would they even be in that area alone?

141
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:02,470
<6-2,BECKETT>等我们警官跟他们聊完后
<6-2,BECKETT>Well, we'll know more once our youth officer

142
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:03,540
<6-2,BECKETT>就知道了
<6-2,BECKETT>is done talking to them.

143
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,810
<6-2,BECKETT>昨天鲁伊兹老师班上
<6-2,BECKETT>Now, what time did...

144
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:07,110
<6-2,BECKETT>是几点下课的
<6-2,BECKETT>Mrs. Ruiz's class let out yesterday?

145
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:09,200
<6-3,PRINCIPAL SILVA>3点放学的   而且每个孩子都是由
<6-3,PRINCIPAL SILVA>At 3 p.m., and each child was picked up

146
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,890
<6-3,PRINCIPAL SILVA>父母或者合法的监护人接走的
<6-3,PRINCIPAL SILVA>by a parent or authorized guardian.

147
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:13,850
<6-4,BECKETT>我需要一份他们的名单
<6-4,BECKETT>Okay, and I'm gonna need a list of all of their names

148
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,850
<6-4,BECKETT>这样我们才能推断出下午5点他们大概在什么地方
<6-4,BECKETT>so we can determine where they were at 5:00 p.m.

149
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:17,940
<6-5,PRINCIPAL SILVA>-没问题  -贝克特警探
<6-5,PRINCIPAL SILVA>- Of course. - Detective Deckett?

150
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:20,490
<6-6,DETECTIVE MIRANDA DANIELS>我和鲁伊兹老师和所有的学生都谈过了
<6-6,DETECTIVE MIRANDA DANIELS>Mrs. Ruiz and I talked to all the students.

151
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:22,030
<6-6,DETECTIVE MIRANDA DANIELS>没人看起来像是目击者
<6-6,DETECTIVE MIRANDA DANIELS>None of them seems to be your witness.

152
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:24,190
<6-7,CASTLE>但是肯定有一个是
<6-7,CASTLE>Except one of them has to be.

153
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:27,070
<6-8,BECKETT>也许我们应该再跟他们聊一次
<6-8,BECKETT>You know, maybe we should talk to them again.

154
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:29,180
<6-9,DANIELS>如果他们害怕说出来  再来一次也没多大帮助
<6-9,DANIELS>If they're afraid to come forward, that's not gonna help.

155
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,760
<6-10,PRINCIPAL SILVA>又或者他们什么都没看见
<6-10,PRINCIPAL SILVA>Or perhaps they didn't see anything.

156
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,770
<6-10,PRINCIPAL SILVA>不管怎样  他们也不该被无休止的问题
<6-10,PRINCIPAL SILVA>Either way, these children shouldn't be subjected

157
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:34,320
<6-10,PRINCIPAL SILVA>-一直纠缠下去  -我明白
<6-10,PRINCIPAL SILVA>- to endless questions. - I know, I understand,

158
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,280
<6-11,BECKETT>但我们必须找到目击证人
<6-11,BECKETT>But we have to find this witness.

159
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,060
<6-12,DANIELS>像这种情况  孩子更容易像
<6-12,DANIELS>In cases like this, a child is often more likely

160
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,920
<6-12,DANIELS>非官方的人袒露心扉
<6-12,DANIELS>to open up to somebody who's not an authority figure - -

161
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,530
<6-12,DANIELS>同学或者朋友
<6-12,DANIELS>A classmate, a friend.

162
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:47,770
<6-13,BECKETT>所以我们要找一个
<6-13,BECKETT>So, basically, we're looking for someone

163
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:49,290
<6-13,BECKETT>不会让他们觉得有压迫感的人
<6-13,BECKETT>who won't intimidate them.

164
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:52,190
<6-13,BECKETT>一个出现在教室里
<6-13,BECKETT>An adult presence in the classroom

165
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:54,140
<6-13,BECKETT>会被八岁的孩子当做是
<6-13,BECKETT>that 8- year- olds will view as a peer,

166
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,570
<6-13,BECKETT>他们同伴的成年人
<6-13,BECKETT>someone that they can consider one of their own?

167
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:59,110
<6-14,PRINCIPAL SILVA>好吧  可我们去哪找这样的人呢
<6-14,PRINCIPAL SILVA>Okay, but where would we find someone like that?

168
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:00,220
<6-14,PRINCIPAL SILVA>通关了
<6-14,PRINCIPAL SILVA>Got it.

169
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,830
<6-15,CASTLE>太简单了
<6-15,CASTLE>Easy.

179
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,420
<7-1,BECKETT>谢谢你  鲁伊兹老师
<7-1,BECKETT>Thank you, Mrs. Ruiz,

180
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:19,250
<7-1,BECKETT>同意让卡塞尔占用你的课堂时间
<7-1,BECKETT>For letting Castle spend time in your classroom.

181
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,960
<7-1,BECKETT>我没什么选择
<7-1,BECKETT>I wasn't given much of a choice.

182
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,570
<7-2,BECKETT>对此我们深表歉意
<7-2,BECKETT>Well, then we apologize for the imposition,

183
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:26,010
<7-2,BECKETT>但我们的确需要找到目击证人
<7-2,BECKETT>but we do need to figure out who this witness is.

184
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,390
<7-2,BECKETT>你们打算怎么做
<7-2,BECKETT>And just how are you going to do that?

185
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:29,180
<7-3,CASTLE>你知道我们已经跟他们都谈过了  对吗
<7-3,CASTLE>You know we spoke to all of them already, right?

186
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,900
<7-3,CASTLE>我不一样  我有儿童一般的心
<7-3,CASTLE>Yes, but being 90% kid myself,

187
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:34,950
<7-3,CASTLE>我知道他们在想什么
<7-3,CASTLE>I have an ability to get into the minds of children.

188
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:36,930
<7-3,CASTLE>而且我有个完美的计划
<7-3,CASTLE>And I have the perfect plan.

189
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:39,800
<7-3,CASTLE>相信我  不可能的
<7-3,CASTLE>Trust me, there is no such thing.

190
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,420
<7-4,CASTLE>卡塞尔先生  你有曾和
<7-4,CASTLE>Have you ever been in a room

191
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,220
<7-4,CASTLE>20个二年级学生待在一起的经历吗
<7-4,CASTLE>with 20 second- graders, Mr. Castle?

192
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,930
<7-4,CASTLE>谢谢你的关心  莱斯丽
<7-4,CASTLE>I appreciate your concern, Leslie.

193
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,110
<7-4,CASTLE>我能叫你莱斯丽吗
<7-4,CASTLE>May I call you Leslie?

194
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:48,700
<7-4,CASTLE>-鲁伊兹老师比较合适  -了解
<7-4,CASTLE>- "Mrs. Ruiz" Is fine.  Excellent.

195
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,710
<7-5,CASTLE>我有信心  对这些小鬼
<7-5,CASTLE>I'm sure I'm more than capable of handling

196
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:53,170
<7-5,CASTLE>我能应付自如
<7-5,CASTLE>anything these little charmers can throw my way.

197
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:01,640
<7-6,CASTLE>别担心  只是个橡皮擦
<7-6,CASTLE>In this case, is an eraser.

198
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,810
<7-7,BECKETT>你们有什么发现吗
<7-7,BECKETT>Hey, what do you got?

199
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:08,200
<7-8,ESPOSITO>我们根据安东老师提供的
<7-8,ESPOSITO>We chased down that partial plate

200
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,390
<7-8,ESPOSITO>零星的车牌资料查了下
<7-8,ESPOSITO>that Anton's teacher gave us.

201
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,580
<7-8,ESPOSITO>她看见的那辆车吗
<7-8,ESPOSITO>That car she saw?

202
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,400
<7-8,ESPOSITO>发现车子注册在一位已退休的
<7-8,ESPOSITO>Looks like it's registered to a retired cop

203
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,010
<7-8,ESPOSITO>名叫克拉克·杰菲的警察名下
<7-8,ESPOSITO>named Clark Jaffe.

204
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:15,820
<7-9,BECKETT>-警察  -对
<7-9,BECKETT>- A cop? - Yeah.

205
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,850
<7-10,ESPOSITO>安东那晚给他打了个电话
<7-10,ESPOSITO>Anton placed a call to him that night from

206
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:19,270
<7-10,ESPOSITO>用的是校外的付费电话
<7-10,ESPOSITO>the pay phone outside the college.

207
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,100
<7-11,BECKETT>好  带他回来
<7-11,BECKETT>Okay, bring him in.

208
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,660
<7-12,ESPOSITO>怕是不行了
<7-12,ESPOSITO>That's gonna be a problem.

209
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,830
<7-12,ESPOSITO>他已经死了  被枪杀的
<7-12,ESPOSITO>Jaffe's dead. Shot to death.

210
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:26,670
<7-13,BECKETT>他也被枪杀了  什么时候
<7-13,BECKETT>He was shot, too? When?

211
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:28,950
<7-14,ESPOSITO>昨天  安东遇害前八小时左右
<7-14,ESPOSITO>Yesterday, about eight hours before Anton.

212
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:31,300
<7-14,ESPOSITO>我进行了弹道对比  吻合
<7-14,ESPOSITO>And I ran ballistics. It's a match.

213
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,640
<7-14,ESPOSITO>是同一个凶手
<7-14,ESPOSITO>It's the same shooter.

214
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:34,610
<7-15,BECKETT>好  我马上来
<7-15,BECKETT>Okay. I'm on my way.

<14-19,JASON>今天的课将由他来帮我上
<14-19,JASON>He's gonna be helping me with today's lessons.

222
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:59,340
<14-19,JASON>早上好  卡塞尔先生
<14-19,JASON>Good morning, Mr. Castle.

223
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,130
<14-19,JASON>好了  大侦探  该你上了
<14-19,JASON>Okay, Columbo. You're on.

224
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,040
<8-1,CASTLE>好
<8-1,CASTLE>Right.

225
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,460
<8-2,CASTLE>同学们  早上好
<8-2,CASTLE>Good morning, class.

226
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,170
<8-3,CASTLE>咱们有谁知道什么是作家吗
<8-3,CASTLE>Does anyone here know what a writer is?

227
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:15,690
<8-4,EMILY>-你说  -作家就是写故事的
<8-4,EMILY>- Yes? - A writer writes stories.

228
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:17,300
<8-4,EMILY>非常正确
<8-4,EMILY>That's exactly right.

229
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:20,280
<8-5,CASTLE>那么...有谁认识任何作家吗
<8-5,CASTLE>And...who here knows a writer?

230
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,280
<8-6,JASON>真无聊
<8-6,JASON>This is boring!

231
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,880
<8-6,JASON>鲁伊兹老师说我可以展示我的拍立得
<8-6,JASON>Mrs. Ruiz said I can show-and-tell my instant camera!

232
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,610
<8-7,CASTLE>稍等会吧  杰森
<8-7,CASTLE>Maybe later, Jason.

233
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,350
<8-7,CASTLE>你说
<8-7,CASTLE>Yes?

234
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:30,700
<8-8,JACK>卡塞尔先生  你不是就作家吗
<8-8,JACK>Mr. Castle, aren't you a writer?

235
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,520
<8-9,CASTLE>事实上  我还真是
<8-9,CASTLE>Well, as a matter of fact, I am.

236
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,840
<8-10,JACK>你有名吗
<8-10,JACK>Are you famous?

237
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,750
<8-11,CASTLE>我不确定"有名"这个词是否恰当
<8-11,CASTLE>Well, I don't know if I'd use the word "Famous."

238
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,090
<8-12,JASON>-有人...  -我爸爸说你的书很烂
<8-12,JASON>-Some people... - my dad says your books suck.

239
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:47,160
<8-12,JASON>卡塞尔先生
<8-12,JASON>Mr. Castle!

240
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,090
<8-13,CASTLE>我的课堂上不能做鬼脸
<8-13,CASTLE>We do not make faces in my classroom.

241
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:50,240
<8-13,CASTLE>是他先的
<8-13,CASTLE>He started it!

242
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:54,350
<8-10,JACK>你说你有计划来着
<8-10,JACK>You said you had a plan?

243
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:56,460
<8-6,JASON>对  我有计划
<8-6,JASON>Yes, yes, I have a plan.

244
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:02,740
<8-3,CASTLE>除了我  还有人认识其他作家吗
<8-3,CASTLE>Aside from me, does anyone here know another writer?

245
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,140
<8-14,CASTLE>这样吧  所有人向左看
<8-14,CASTLE>Tell you what. Everyone look to your left.

246
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:09,090
<8-4,EMILY>你们看到的都是作家
<8-4,EMILY>You're looking at a writer.

247
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,870
<8-13,CASTLE>除了最后一列的同学  你们看的是墙
<8-13,CASTLE>Except for you guys on the end. You're looking at the wall.

248
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:15,500
<8-14,CASTLE>我们都是作家
<8-14,CASTLE>We are all writers.

249
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:19,370
<8-14,CASTLE>如果你会讲故事  你就能写故事
<8-14,CASTLE>If you can tell a story, you can write a story.

250
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:21,700
<8-14,CASTLE>所以...
<8-14,CASTLE>So...

251
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:26,160
<8-14,CASTLE>咱们现在就开始吧  咱们来写个故事
<8-14,CASTLE>Let's do that right now. Let's write a story.

252
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,780
<8-14,CASTLE>主角可以是一个小男孩
<8-14,CASTLE>It can be about a little boy

253
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,530
<8-14,CASTLE>或是小女孩  就像你们一样
<8-14,CASTLE>or a little girl, just like you.

254
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:33,470
<8-14,CASTLE>情节可以搞笑也可以恐怖  随你们发挥
<8-14,CASTLE>It can be as silly or as scary as you want it to be.

255
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:35,650
<8-15,EMILY>我能写一个过家家的故事吗
<8-15,EMILY>Can I write about having a tea party?

256
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:36,690
<8-16,CASTLE>当然可以
<8-16,CASTLE>Of course you can.

257
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:39,730
<8-17,SOPHIE>卡塞尔先生  我可以编故事吗
<8-17,SOPHIE>Mr. Castle, is it okay to make things up?

258
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:41,680
<8-18,CASTLE>当然可以  你们可以编故事
<8-18,CASTLE>Of course, yes. You can make things up,

259
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,300
<8-18,CASTLE>又或者  你们可以
<8-18,CASTLE>Or you could, um, you could write it

260
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,770
<8-18,CASTLE>改写生活中真实发生过的事
<8-18,CASTLE>based on something that happened in real life.

261
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,960
<8-18,CASTLE>大家都准备好了吗
<8-18,CASTLE>Is everyone ready?

262
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:54,850
<8-18,CASTLE>开始
<8-18,CASTLE>Uh, go!

263
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:03,830
<9-1,BECKETT>找到两名受害者之间的联系了吗
<9-1,BECKETT>We found a link between our two vics?

264
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,760
<9-2,ESPOSITO>除了知道安东那晚上了杰菲的车
<9-2,ESPOSITO>Other than Anton getting in Jaffe's car that night,

265
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,430
<9-2,ESPOSITO>其他还没有  而且安东没有案底
<9-2,ESPOSITO>not so far, and Anton's never been in trouble with the law.

266
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,700
<9-3,BECKETT>问过安东的父母了吗
<9-3,BECKETT>You talk to Anton's parents?

267
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,900
<9-4,ESPOSITO>问了  他们从没听说过杰菲
<9-4,ESPOSITO>Yeah, they never heard of Jaffe.

268
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:11,850
<9-4,ESPOSITO>我跟你说  这两个人
<9-4,ESPOSITO>I'm telling you, these guys,

269
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:13,260
<9-4,ESPOSITO>他们住在不同的街区
<9-4,ESPOSITO>they lived in different neighborhoods,

270
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,590
<9-4,ESPOSITO>结交的是不同的圈子
<9-4,ESPOSITO>they moved in different circles.

271
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,850
<9-5,BECKETT>他们一起开车离开的
<9-5,BECKETT>They drive off together,

272
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:17,920
<9-5,BECKETT>然后第二天两人都死了
<9-5,BECKETT>and then the next day they both end up dead?

273
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:20,230
<9-5,BECKETT>他们一定有关联  我们要查出来
<9-5,BECKETT>They're connected. We just gotta find out how.

274
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:22,980
<9-6,ESPOSITO>还有点发现  克拉克·杰菲遇害后
<9-6,ESPOSITO>I got something else. After Clark Jaffe was killed,

275
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,740
<9-6,ESPOSITO>有人翻过他的家
<9-6,ESPOSITO>someone tossed his place.

276
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,880
<9-7,BECKETT>凶手在找什么东西
<9-7,BECKETT>Killer was looking for something.

277
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,990
<9-7,BECKETT>不多喝点水的话  他们能把你累死
<9-7,BECKETT>If you don't hydrate, they'll eat you alive.

278
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:37,380
<10-1,CASTLE>谢谢  你真好
<10-1,CASTLE>Ah, thank you. That's very kind.

279
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:39,880
<10-1,CASTLE>他们写的故事怎么样了
<10-1,CASTLE>So, how are those stories they wrote?

280
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,010
<10-2,CASTLE>别客气  我的桌子尽管用
<10-2,CASTLE>Oh, and feel free to use my desk.

281
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:44,160
<10-2,CASTLE>我...只是
<10-2,CASTLE>I was.. I just...

282
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:47,700
<10-2,CASTLE>你不太喜欢我  对吧
<10-2,CASTLE>You don't like me very much, do you?

283
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,240
<6-4,BECKETT>不是  卡塞尔先生
<6-4,BECKETT>That's not it, Mr. Castle.

284
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:51,950
<6-5,PRINCIPAL SILVA>他们还是孩子
<6-5,PRINCIPAL SILVA>These are kids,

285
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,500
<6-6,DETECTIVE MIRANDA DANIELS>我有责任保护他们
<6-6,DETECTIVE MIRANDA DANIELS>and it's my job to protect them,

286
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:56,970
<6-7,CASTLE>即便对方是出于好意
<6-7,CASTLE>even from people who mean well.

287
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:00,840
<6-8,BECKETT>而且  如果他们真有人看到了什么
<6-8,BECKETT>Besides, if one of them did see something,

288
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,480
<6-9,DANIELS>他都吓得没勇气说出来
<6-9,DANIELS>They're too afraid to come forward.

289
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,380
<8-10,JACK>你又怎么能指望他会写下来呢
<8-10,JACK>So why would you expect them to write about?

290
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:07,100
<8-11,CASTLE>我没有  起码不是直接写下来
<8-11,CASTLE>Well, I don't. Well, not directly.

291
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,480
<10-2,CASTLE>但一段那么让人难忘的经历
<10-2,CASTLE>But an experience that powerful

292
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:11,990
<10-3,CASTLE>总会想办法自己浮出水面
<10-3,CASTLE>is going to find a way to express itself

293
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:13,460
<10-3,CASTLE>最后就会落于纸上
<10-3,CASTLE>and end up on the page.

294
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:17,380
<10-3,CASTLE>再天马行空的想象也是基于事实基础的
<10-3,CASTLE>Even the wildest fantasy is based on a kernel of truth.

295
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:20,010
<10-3,CASTLE>作为一个故事大师
<10-3,CASTLE>As a master storyteller, I'm able to separate

296
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:24,280
<10-3,CASTLE>我能从细微的痕迹中分辨出事实和虚构
<10-3,CASTLE>the make-believe from the telltale details of thinly veiled fact.

297
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,400
<10-3,CASTLE>记住我的话  鲁伊兹老师
<10-3,CASTLE>You mark my words, Mrs. Ruiz...

298
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,840
<10-3,CASTLE>这堆东西中的某处
<10-3,CASTLE>Somewhere in this pile is the key

299
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,760
<10-3,CASTLE>有我们找到目击者的关键
<10-3,CASTLE>to identifying our witness.

300
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:41,440
<11-1,BECKETT>我查了杰菲的车
<11-1,BECKETT>I followed up on Jaffe's car.

301
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:43,770
<11-1,BECKETT>没有导航  没有收费系统的记录
<11-1,BECKETT>There's no G.P.S., no E-ZPass.

302
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:44,900
<11-1,BECKETT>完全没有办法
<11-1,BECKETT>There's no way of finding out

303
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,730
<11-1,BECKETT>知道他和安东那晚去了哪里
<11-1,BECKETT>where he and Anton went that night.

304
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:49,400
<11-1,BECKETT>好吧  你的财务状况调查如何
<11-1,BECKETT>Okay, what about you on financials?

305
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,110
<11-2,ESPOSITO>作为前警察  他的生活比和尚还简谱
<11-2,ESPOSITO>For an ex-cop, the guy lived like a monk.

306
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:53,500
<11-2,ESPOSITO>安东也是  而这正是我们的麻烦所在
<11-2,ESPOSITO>So did Anton, which is part of our problem.

307
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,180
<11-2,ESPOSITO>那孩子没手机  没信用卡记录
<11-2,ESPOSITO>The kid had no cell phone, no credit cards to pull.

308
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,850
<11-2,ESPOSITO>他们俩一定有联系
<11-2,ESPOSITO>There's got to be a connection between these two guys.

309
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:59,160
<11-2,ESPOSITO>但我就是找不到
<11-2,ESPOSITO>I'm just not finding it.

310
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:00,910
<11-2,ESPOSITO>但我不理解的是
<11-2,ESPOSITO>But here's what I don't get --

311
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,810
<11-2,ESPOSITO>22岁的一个卖冰淇淋的
<11-2,ESPOSITO>what's a 22-year-old ice cream man

312
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:04,090
<11-2,ESPOSITO>能和一个前任警察有什么关系呢
<11-2,ESPOSITO>doing with an ex-cop, anyway?

313
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:05,270
<11-3,RYAN>关于这事我可能有线索了
<11-3,RYAN>I may have a lead on that.

314
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:07,310
<11-3,RYAN>我调查了那辆冰淇淋车
<11-3,RYAN>I was looking into the ice cream truck.

315
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:09,380
<11-3,RYAN>上周在马布尔山被贴了罚单
<11-3,RYAN>It was ticketed last week up on Marble Hill,

316
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:11,810
<11-3,RYAN>-但那根本不在安东的路线上  -于是
<11-3,RYAN>- which is nowhere near Anton's route. - So?

317
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:14,520
<11-5,RYAN>于是我调查了克拉克·杰菲的财务状况
<11-5,RYAN>So I checked into Clark Jaffe's financials.

318
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,700
<11-5,RYAN>杰菲的信用卡显示他恰在当天
<11-5,RYAN>Jaffe's credit card shows that he parked at a meter

319
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:19,630
<11-5,RYAN>用过同一条街的停车场
<11-5,RYAN>the exact same block on the same day.

320
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:22,600
<11-6,BECKETT>这绝不是巧合
<11-6,BECKETT>That's not a coincidence.

321
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:26,970
<12-1,RYAN>这是当天拍到安东的车的交通监控录像
<12-1,RYAN>This is traffic cam footage of Anton's truck that day.

322
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:28,540
<12-1,RYAN>看
<12-1,RYAN>Now watch.

323
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,490
<12-2,ESPOSITO>他进了那家物流店
<12-2,ESPOSITO>He goes into that shipping store.

324
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:37,980
<12-2,ESPOSITO>他去那干什么
<12-2,ESPOSITO>What's he doing in there?

325
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,570
<12-3,RYAN>不知道  但我仔细看了一遍录像
<12-3,RYAN>I have no idea. But I scrubbed all the footage.

326
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,260
<12-3,RYAN>这是一小时前的
<12-3,RYAN>This is from an hour earlier.

327
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,830
<12-4,BECKETT>绿色凯美瑞
<12-4,BECKETT>A green camry.

328
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:49,650
<12-4,BECKETT>和克拉克·杰菲
<12-4,BECKETT>And that's Clark Jaffe.

329
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:52,800
<12-5,ESPOSITO>进了同一家店
<12-5,ESPOSITO>Going into the same store.

330
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:55,320
<12-6,BECKETT>他们俩去那儿干什么
<12-6,BECKETT>So what were the two of them doing?

331
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,570
<12-6,BECKETT>我找到啦
<12-6,BECKETT>I found it!

332
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,920
<12-6,BECKETT>我想我找到目击者了
<12-6,BECKETT>I think I found our witness!

333
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,420
<12-6,BECKETT>就是这份  是杰克
<12-6,BECKETT>Right here. It's Jack.

334
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:06,210
<13-1,CASTLE>他写了一个关于邪恶巨人的故事
<13-1,CASTLE>He wrote a story about an evil giant,

335
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:07,550
<13-1,CASTLE>从孩子的角度看
<13-1,CASTLE>which, from a child's perspective,

336
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:09,270
<13-1,CASTLE>就是凶手应有的形象
<13-1,CASTLE>is how the killer would seem.

337
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:11,870
<13-1,CASTLE>他说那个巨人声音很大很生气
<13-1,CASTLE>He said that the giant spoke in a loud, angry voice,

338
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:15,490
<13-1,CASTLE>说话很凶  而且说他要伤害别人
<13-1,CASTLE>said mean things, and promised he would hurt someone.

339
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:17,480
<13-1,CASTLE>那不过是杰克与豌豆的故事
<13-1,CASTLE>That's just "Jack and the Beanstalk."

340
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,460
<13-2,CASTLE>没错  但他的故事里  巨人有把枪
<13-2,CASTLE>Yes, but in this story, the giant had a gun.

341
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,190
<13-2,CASTLE>好吧  就算你是对的
<13-2,CASTLE>Okay. Let's say you're right.

342
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,350
<13-2,CASTLE>假设杰克当时真藏在冰淇淋车里
<13-2,CASTLE>Let's say Jack was hiding in the ice cream truck,

343
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:26,880
<13-2,CASTLE>而且他太害怕不愿说出来
<13-2,CASTLE>and he's afraid to tell anyone.

344
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,940
<13-2,CASTLE>你又怎么让他告诉你呢
<13-2,CASTLE>How are you gonna get him to tell you?

345
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:41,130
<14-1,CASTLE>继续前进  前进
<14-1,CASTLE>Keep moving! Move up!

346
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:43,640
<14-1,CASTLE>停止前进  兄弟们  掩护我
<14-1,CASTLE>Hold back, guys! Cover me!

347
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:44,970
<14-2,JACK>干掉他们啦
<14-2,JACK>Got 'em!

348
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:46,960
<14-3,CASTLE>干的好  等等
<14-3,CASTLE>Nice work! Whoa! Wait a minute.

349
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,940
<14-3,CASTLE>我想我看到前方出现了更多坏人
<14-3,CASTLE>I think I see more bad guys ahead.

350
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:51,540
<14-4,JACK>怎么了
<14-4,JACK>What?

351
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,880
<14-5,CASTLE>有个巨人
<14-5,CASTLE>There's a giant.

352
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,510
<14-5,CASTLE>他有没有
<14-5,CASTLE>And does he...

353
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:57,480
<14-5,CASTLE>没错  他拿着一把枪
<14-5,CASTLE>Yeah. He does. He's got a gun.

354
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,530
<14-6,JACK>糟糕  快趴下  他要开枪了
<14-6,JACK>No! Get down! He's gonna shoot it!

355
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,670
<14-7,CASTLE>你这么觉得吗
<14-7,CASTLE>You think?

356
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:03,330
<14-8,JACK>上次就是这样  他说  我要开枪了
<14-8,JACK>He did last time. He said, "I'm gonna shoot."

357
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,520
<14-8,JACK>然后他就开枪了
<14-8,JACK>Then he did.

358
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,460
<14-9,CASTLE>-上次  就像你的故事吗  -是
<14-9,CASTLE>- Last time, like in your story? - Yes.

359
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,990
<14-10,JACK>他开枪了  砰砰
<14-10,JACK>He shot his gun -- bing, bing!

360
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:11,370
<14-10,JACK>然后另一个人就流血了
<14-10,JACK>And then the other guy was bleeding.

361
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:13,750
<14-10,JACK>不过
<14-10,JACK>Only...

362
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,940
<14-11,CASTLE>这并不是个故事  对吗  杰克
<14-11,CASTLE>it wasn't a story, was it, Jack?

363
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,390
<14-11,CASTLE>这是真的
<14-11,CASTLE>It really happened.

364
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,850
<14-12,JACK>我好害怕  我闭上了眼睛
<14-12,JACK>I was scared. I closed my eyes

365
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:21,810
<14-12,JACK>直到巨人消失
<14-12,JACK>until the giant disappeared.

366
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:23,890
<14-13,CASTLE>哥们儿  你很勇敢
<14-13,CASTLE>Hey, man, you are very brave.

367
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:26,210
<14-14,JACK>我哥哥不是这么说的
<14-14,JACK>That's not what my brother said.

368
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:27,850
<14-15,CASTLE>你哥哥也在
<14-15,CASTLE>Your brother was there?

369
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:31,680
<14-16,JACK>他说  别当胆小鬼了  这只是电影
<14-16,JACK>He said, "Don't be a chicken. It's just a stupid movie."

370
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:34,440
<14-16,JACK>然后他就换台了
<14-16,JACK>Then he changed the channel.

371
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,090
<14-17,CASTLE>-巨人是在电视上的  -是的
<14-17,CASTLE>- The giant was on TV? - Yeah.

372
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:44,920
<14-19,JASON>卡塞尔先生尿裤子了  卡塞尔先生尿裤子了
<14-19,JASON>Mr. Castle wet his pants! Mr. Castle wet his pants!

373
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:48,500
<14-20,CASTLE>没有  这是因为草坪是湿的
<14-20,CASTLE>No, no -- see, the ground was wet!

374
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:02,300
<15-1,CLERK>安东和杰菲先生  他们常来
<15-1,CLERK>Yeah. Anton and Mr. Jaffe. They come in here a lot.

375
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:05,100
<15-1,CLERK>安东六个月前租了个
<15-1,CLERK>Anton rented a P.O. box here

376
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,260
<15-1,CLERK>邮政信箱  552号
<15-1,CLERK>about six months ago, box 552.

377
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:08,740
<15-1,CLERK>他和杰菲一起用
<15-1,CLERK>And he shared it with Jaffe.

378
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:11,440
<15-2,BECKETT>-他们共用一个邮政信箱  -是的
<15-2,BECKETT>- They were sharing a P.O. box? - Yeah.

379
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,890
<15-4,BECKETT>他们收到的都是什么样的邮件
<15-4,BECKETT>What kind of mail were they getting?

380
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:14,820
<15-5,CLERK>奇怪的就在这儿  他们没收到过邮件
<15-5,CLERK>That's the thing. They weren't getting any mail.

381
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,670
<15-5,CLERK>至少我没见过
<15-5,CLERK>At least not that I ever saw.

382
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,420
<15-6,ESPOSITO>那他们用这邮箱干什么
<15-6,ESPOSITO>Then why did they need the box?

383
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:21,000
<15-7,CLERK>我只知道他们都每两周来查看一次
<15-7,CLERK>All I know is they both came in twice a week to check it.

384
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,510
<15-8,BECKETT>-一起吗  -不是
<15-8,BECKETT>- Together? - No.

385
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,680
<15-9,CLERK>一般隔一小时左右
<15-9,CLERK>Usually about an hour apart.

386
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,290
<15-10,ESPOSITO>这是他们的情报秘密传递点
<15-10,ESPOSITO>They were using it as a dead drop.

387
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:27,580
<15-11,BECKETT>没错  但传递的是什么呢
<15-11,BECKETT>Yeah, but for what?

388
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:29,080
<15-11,BECKETT>你最后一次见他们是什么时候
<15-11,BECKETT>Uh -- when was the last time you saw them?

389
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,340
<15-12,CLERK>上周他们两个我都见过
<15-12,CLERK>I saw 'em both last week.

390
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,380
<15-12,CLERK>但昨天安东又来了
<15-12,CLERK>But Anton came in yesterday.

391
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,470
<15-12,CLERK>而且我告诉他那通电话的事后
<15-12,CLERK>And he seemed a little worked up

392
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:37,480
<15-12,CLERK>他看起来有点激动
<15-12,CLERK>after I told him about the phone call I'd got.

393
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,400
<15-13,ESPOSITO>哪通电话
<15-13,ESPOSITO>What phone call?

394
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,460
<15-14,CLERK>一个俄国口音的人打来的
<15-14,CLERK>Some dude with a Russian accent

395
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:43,410
<15-14,CLERK>问我说552号邮箱是谁的
<15-14,CLERK>called asking me who owned box 552 --

396
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:44,710
<15-14,CLERK>就是安东的那个
<15-14,CLERK>Anton's box.

397
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,720
<15-14,CLERK>我跟他说我们不能提供客户信息
<15-14,CLERK>I told the caller we don't give out that kind of information,

398
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,880
<15-14,CLERK>但当我跟安东说起此事时
<15-14,CLERK>but when I mentioned the call to Anton,

399
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:51,950
<15-14,CLERK>他突然失控了
<15-14,CLERK>He flipped out.

400
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:53,270
<15-15,ESPOSITO>这么说安东认识这个人
<15-15,ESPOSITO>So Anton knew this guy.

401
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:56,470
<15-16,BECKETT>-是  -我也这么认为  因为他非常慌张
<15-16,BECKETT>- Yeah. - I guess so, 'cause he went into total panic mode,

402
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:57,790
<15-17,CLERK>说要打个电话
<15-17,CLERK>Said he had to use the phone.

403
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:59,230
<15-17,CLERK>但我不能让他打
<15-17,CLERK>But I couldn't let him use it.

404
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:00,610
<15-17,CLERK>因为这违法了公司的规定
<15-17,CLERK>It's against company policy,

405
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:02,550
<15-17,CLERK>于是他就跑了出去
<15-17,CLERK>So he just raced out of here.

406
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,090
<15-18,BECKETT>那是什么时间
<15-18,BECKETT>What time was that?

407
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:05,560
<15-20,BECKETT>-三点  -好的  谢了
<15-20,BECKETT>- 3:00. - Okay, thanks.

408
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,650
<15-21,BECKETT>下午三点  两个小时后安东就被杀了
<15-21,BECKETT>3:00 P.M.? That's two hours before Anton was killed.

409
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,580
<15-22,ESPOSITO>看来这个俄国人是来干掉他的
<15-22,ESPOSITO>Sounds like this Russian dude was coming for him.

410
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,500
<15-22,ESPOSITO>你觉得安东是想打给谁  杰菲吗
<15-22,ESPOSITO>Who do you think Anton was trying to call -- Jaffe?

411
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,120
<15-23,BECKETT>或者是另一个与这些事有关系的人
<15-23,BECKETT>Or someone else connected to all of this.

412
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:15,800
<15-23,BECKETT>安东没有手机
<15-23,BECKETT>Look, Anton didn't have a cell,

413
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,690
<15-23,BECKETT>所以如果他真想打电话  那一定就在附近
<15-23,BECKETT>so if he really needed to make a call, he'd go nearby.

414
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:19,820
<15-24,ESPOSITO>我会排查这里所有的商店
<15-24,ESPOSITO>I'll canvass all the stores in the area,

415
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,300
<15-24,ESPOSITO>看看有没有人让安东打过电话
<15-24,ESPOSITO>see if anyone let Anton use their phone.

416
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,240
<15-25,BECKETT>很好  学校快要放学了
<15-25,BECKETT>Great. And, school's almost out.

417
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,760
<15-25,BECKETT>我去接卡塞尔  看看他有没有
<15-25,BECKETT>I'll get ahold of Castle and see if he's gotten

418
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:26,500
<15-25,BECKETT>找到目击者
<15-25,BECKETT>any closer to finding our witness.

419
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,010
<16-1,CASTLE>还没有进展
<16-1,CASTLE>No, no breakthroughs yet,

420
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,960
<16-1,CASTLE>不过  好消息是
<16-1,CASTLE>But, the good news is -- is,

421
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,930
<16-1,CASTLE>他们好像已经把我当作他们的一员了
<16-1,CASTLE>it looks like they've accepted me as one of their own.

422
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:35,020
<16-1,CASTLE>各位  把钱包还给我  那是别人送的礼物
<16-1,CASTLE>Okay, guys, give me the wallet. That was a gift.

423
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,810
<16-2,BECKETT>等等  你那边到底什么情况
<16-2,BECKETT>Wait, what is going on over there?

424
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:38,760
<16-2,BECKETT>有什么问题吗
<16-2,BECKETT>Is there a problem?

425
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,330
<16-3,CASTLE>没有  一切顺利  晚上再谈
<16-3,CASTLE>No, everything's fine. I'll talk to you tonight.

<16-3,CASTLE>鲁伊兹老师  能帮个忙吗
<16-3,CASTLE>Mrs. Ruiz, a little help here?

<16-4,EMILY>Okay, that's get-- okay.

<16-4,EMILY>孩子们  去走廊站好队准备放学
<16-4,EMILY>Children, line up in the hall for dismissal.

433
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,620
<16-4,EMILY>卡塞尔先生  你还好吗
<16-4,EMILY>Mr. Castle, are you okay?

00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:17,030
<16-6,EMILY>我知道这种感觉
<16-6,EMILY>I know how it feels.

437
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,540
<16-6,EMILY>有时我也会遇到不好的事
<16-6,EMILY>Sometimes bad things happen to me, too.

438
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:20,860
<16-7,CASTLE>是吗
<16-7,CASTLE>They do?

439
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,410
<16-8,EMILY>很不好的事
<16-8,EMILY>Really bad things --

440
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:26,220
<16-8,EMILY>今天早晨鲁伊兹老师问我的时候
<16-8,EMILY>Things I didn't want to tell Mrs. Ruiz

441
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,120
<16-8,EMILY>我不想告诉她
<16-8,EMILY>when she asked me this morning.

442
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,390
<16-9,CASTLE>什么事呢
<16-9,CASTLE>Well, things like what?

443
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:32,740
<16-10,EMILY>比如昨天  我...
<16-10,EMILY>Like yesterday, I was...

444
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,010
<16-10,EMILY>艾米丽  快过来 亲爱的
<16-10,EMILY>Emily? Come along, dear.

445
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:36,030
<16-11,EMILY>我们去看医生不能迟到
<16-11,EMILY>We don't want to be late for the doctor.

446
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,800
<16-11,EMILY>你明天会来吗
<16-11,EMILY>Will you be here tomorrow?

447
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,650
<16-12,CASTLE>一定来
<16-12,CASTLE>You can count on it.

448
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:51,500
<17-1,BECKETT>埃斯波西托跟艾米丽的父母的确认了
<17-1,BECKETT>So Esposito confirmed with Emily's parents

449
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,800
<17-1,BECKETT>那天她14岁的哥哥应该负责
<17-1,BECKETT>that her 14-year-old brother was supposed to be

450
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:57,100
<17-1,BECKETT>看着她的  可是他当时在玩游戏
<17-1,BECKETT>watching her that day, but he was playing video games

451
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,840
<17-1,BECKETT>好几个小时都没有看她
<17-1,BECKETT>and he didn't check on her for hours.

452
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,690
<17-2,CASTLE>这么说她可能溜出去了
<17-2,CASTLE>So she could have sneaked out.

453
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:02,260
<17-2,CASTLE>就是她  贝克特  我确定
<17-2,CASTLE>It is her, Beckett. I knew it!

454
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:05,310
<17-3,BECKETT>所以我们昨晚就应该去她家跟她谈
<17-3,BECKETT>Which is why we should have talked to her at her place last night.

455
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,720
<17-4,CASTLE>不顾把她吓到吗  不行  不行
<17-4,CASTLE>And risk intimidating her? No, no.

456
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,870
<17-4,CASTLE>这个小女孩  她已经准备好要跟我说了
<17-4,CASTLE>This girl's -- she's ready to open up to me.

457
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,740
<17-4,CASTLE>我们有种  特别的感情
<17-4,CASTLE>We have a... a special connection.

458
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,750
<17-5,BECKETT>是吗  我需要担心吗
<17-5,BECKETT>Really? Should I be worried?

459
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,880
<17-6,CASTLE>只需要担心我会比你先破案
<17-6,CASTLE>Only that I'm gonna solve the case before you.

460
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:21,940
<17-8,ALEXIS>你们要去哪
<17-8,ALEXIS>Where do you think you're going?

461
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:23,910
<17-9,CASTLE>二年级教室
<17-9,CASTLE>Second grade.

462
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:25,720
<17-10,ALEXIS>要吃完早餐才能走
<17-10,ALEXIS>Not without finishing your breakfast.

463
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,310
<17-11,CASTLE>我基本吃完了  而且我要迟到了
<17-11,CASTLE>I ate most of it, and I'm just -- I'm late.

464
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,400
<17-12,ALEXIS>拜托  老爸  就再吃一口
<17-12,ALEXIS>Come on, dad, just one more bite.

465
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,870
<17-13,CASTLE>阿丽克西斯  我不...
<17-13,CASTLE>Alexis, I'm not --

466
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:32,520
<17-14,ALEXIS>别忘了你的午餐
<17-14,ALEXIS>Now don't forget your lunch.

467
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,200
<17-15,CASTLE>好吧  你说得对
<17-15,CASTLE>Okay. You're right.

468

<17-15,CASTLE>她的确有点怪异  我会跟她谈的
<17-15,CASTLE>It's weird. I'll talk to her.

469
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:40,220
<17-17,CASTLE>-好  -不过现在...
<17-17,CASTLE>- Okay. - But right now...

470
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,250
<17-17,CASTLE>我要赶紧去过家家了
<17-17,CASTLE>I'm late for a tea party.

<18-1,CASTLE>Thank you so mu--

00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,080

<18-1,CASTLE>Oh, that's plenty.

473
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,650
<18-1,CASTLE>这茶是你自己泡的吗
<18-1,CASTLE>Did you make this tea yourself?

474
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:52,830
<18-3,CASTLE>不得不说  太好喝了
<18-3,CASTLE>I have to say, it's excellent.

475
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:54,750
<18-5,CASTLE>-谢谢  -不  应该谢谢你
<18-5,CASTLE>- Thank you. - No, thank you.

476
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,140
<18-6,EMILY>你要加糖吗
<18-6,EMILY>Do you want some sugar?

477
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,730
<18-7,CASTLE>其实我正在减肥
<18-7,CASTLE>Actually, I'm trying to cut back.

478
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:00,540
<18-7,CASTLE>你有低能量仙尘吗
<18-7,CASTLE>Do you have any low-calorie fairy dust?

479
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,090
<18-8,EMILY>谢谢
<18-8,EMILY>Thank you.

480
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:05,230
<18-9,CASTLE>太好了
<18-9,CASTLE>Perfect.

481
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,950
<18-9,CASTLE>太好喝了  非常感谢
<18-9,CASTLE>Delicious. Thank you very much.

482
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,820
<18-9,CASTLE>也谢谢你课间跟我一起玩
<18-9,CASTLE>And thank you for spending recess with me.

483
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,050
<18-10,EMILY>不客气
<18-10,EMILY>You're welcome.

484
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,920
<18-10,EMILY>你想建一座冰宫吗
<18-10,EMILY>Do you want to build an ice palace?

485
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:17,640
<18-11,CASTLE>这是我最喜欢的事
<18-11,CASTLE>It's only my favorite thing to do.

486
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:19,720
<18-12,CASTLE>开始吧
<18-12,CASTLE>Here we go.

487
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,820
<18-12,CASTLE>太漂亮了
<18-12,CASTLE>Oh, they are nice.

488
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,380
<18-12,CASTLE>艾米丽  你还记得吗  昨天你跟我说
<18-12,CASTLE>You know, Emily, do you remember yesterday

489
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:28,210
<18-12,CASTLE>你遇到了非常不好的事情
<18-12,CASTLE>you said that something really bad happened,

490
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,130
<18-12,CASTLE>那事情...
<18-12,CASTLE>something...

491
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:30,800
<18-13,EMILY>你造的墙太高了
<18-13,EMILY>You're making the wall too high.

492
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,270
<18-14,CASTLE>抱歉
<18-14,CASTLE>Oh. Sorry.

493
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,370
<18-14,CASTLE>这样好一些了吗
<18-14,CASTLE>Is that better?

494
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,590
<18-14,CASTLE>好了
<18-14,CASTLE>All right.

495
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:37,050
<18-14,CASTLE>你说有些事情
<18-14,CASTLE>You said it was something

496
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:39,340
<18-14,CASTLE>你不想告诉鲁伊兹老师
<18-14,CASTLE>that you didn't want to tell Mrs. Ruiz about.

497
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:41,650
<18-14,CASTLE>那你想跟我说说吗
<18-14,CASTLE>Do you think maybe you'd want to tell me?

498
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,640
<18-14,CASTLE>好吧
<18-14,CASTLE>Okay.

499
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,710
<18-14,CASTLE>你知道  如果你愿意可以跟我说说
<18-14,CASTLE>You know, you could -- if you wanted.

500
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:49,960
<18-14,CASTLE>就好像一位公主对另一位公主
<18-14,CASTLE>It would just be... one princess to another.

501
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:52,720
<18-15,EMILY>因为公主们要互相帮助吗
<18-15,EMILY>Because princesses help each other?

502
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:55,310
<18-15,EMILY>因为公主们要互相帮助
<18-15,EMILY>Because princesses help each other.

503
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,520
<18-17,EMILY>这和杰森有关
<18-17,EMILY>It's about Jason.

504
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:02,730
<18-18,CASTLE>杰森  那个做鬼脸的小孩吗
<18-18,CASTLE>Jason -- that kid who makes faces, Jason?

505
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,330
<18-19,EMILY>他欺负人
<18-19,EMILY>He's a bully.

506
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,500
<18-19,EMILY>他说一些难听的话还扯我的头发
<18-19,EMILY>He says mean things and pulls my hair.

507
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:10,220
<18-19,EMILY>今天早上他踩了我的脚  故意的
<18-19,EMILY>This morning, he stepped on my foot -- on purpose.

508
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:13,680
<18-20,CASTLE>艾米丽  你知道为什么人会做不好的事吗
<18-20,CASTLE>Emily, do you know why people do mean things?

509
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,100
<18-20,CASTLE>因为这样会让他们觉得自己很坚强
<18-20,CASTLE>'Cause it makes 'em feel strong.

510
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:19,170
<18-20,CASTLE>真的  可你和我  我们本身就很坚强
<18-20,CASTLE>Really, though, you and me, we're the strong ones.

511
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:20,990
<18-20,CASTLE>我们只是把我们的力量放在心里
<18-20,CASTLE>We just keep our strength inside.

512
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:23,090
<18-20,CASTLE>以至于有时候我们自己都会忘了它的存在
<18-20,CASTLE>So sometimes we forget it's there.

513
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:25,770
<18-21,EMILY>就好像有时候我忘了我口袋里有口香糖
<18-21,EMILY>Like sometimes I forget I have gum in my pocket.

514
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:30,210
<18-22,CASTLE>是的  所以下次杰森再欺负你
<18-22,CASTLE>Exactly. So, next time Jason does something mean,

515
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:34,680
<18-22,CASTLE>你要拿出勇气  释放它
<18-22,CASTLE>you just use that strength and just let it go.

516
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:37,580
<18-22,CASTLE>当他发现无法使你生气  他就不会来烦你
<18-22,CASTLE>When he sees he can't upset you, he'll stop bothering you.

517
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:38,420
<18-22,CASTLE>好吗
<18-22,CASTLE>Okay?

518
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:43,280
<18-23,EMILY>我能出去玩了吗
<18-23,EMILY>Can I go out and play now?

519
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,730
<18-24,CASTLE>当然  这些盘子我来洗
<18-24,CASTLE>Of course. I'll take care of these dishes

520
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:46,180
<18-24,CASTLE>宫殿我会来完成的
<18-24,CASTLE>and finish the palace.

521
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:52,840
<18-2,EMILY>不是她  对吗
<18-2,EMILY>Not her, huh?

522
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:54,970
<18-25,CASTLE>来吧  你就幸灾乐祸吧
<18-25,CASTLE>Go ahead. Gloat.

523
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,340
<18-25,CASTLE>可能这就是个愚蠢的想法
<18-25,CASTLE>Maybe this was a dumb idea.

524
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,680
<18-25,CASTLE>当然是
<18-25,CASTLE>Oh, it was.

525
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,940
<18-25,CASTLE>但这个笨办法
<18-25,CASTLE>But...that dumb idea

526
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,230
<28-1,EMILY>也让艾米丽对你吐露了心声
<28-1,EMILY>got Emily to confide in you.

527
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,140
<18-25,CASTLE>他们渐渐信任你了  卡塞尔先生
<18-25,CASTLE>You're earning their trust, Mr. Castle.

528
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,540
<18-26,CASTLE>我想是的  不是吗
<18-26,CASTLE>I guess I am, aren't I?

529
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:14,140
<18-20,CASTLE>如果你让艾米丽对你敞开心扉
<18-20,CASTLE>And if you got Emily to open up to you,

530
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,530
<18-15,EMILY>接下来的事谁知道呢
<18-15,EMILY>then who knows?

531
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:18,290
<18-10,EMILY>可能那个目击者也会这样的
<18-10,EMILY>Maybe that witness really will come forward.

532
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:20,770
<18-4,EMILY>谢谢你
<18-4,EMILY>Thank you...

533
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:22,390
<18-27,CASTLE>莱斯丽
<18-27,CASTLE>Leslie?

534
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:25,120
<17-6,CASTLE>还是叫我鲁伊兹老师好点
<17-6,CASTLE>Still Mrs. Ruiz. Right.

535
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,310
<17-7,BECKETT>天呐
<17-7,BECKETT>Oh, dear!

536
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:29,620
<17-7,BECKETT>让一下
<17-7,BECKETT>Please!

537
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,500
<19-1,JASON>她一拳打在我鼻子上
<19-1,JASON>She punched me in the nose!

538
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:36,000
<19-2,EMILY>这是我内心的力量
<19-2,EMILY>It was my inside strength.

539
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,340
<19-2,EMILY>我释放它了  就像卡塞尔先生说的那样
<19-2,EMILY>I let it go, like Mr. Castle said.

540
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:41,180
<19-3,JASON>-你让她揍我  -什么  不是的杰森
<19-3,JASON>- You told her to hit me?! - What?! No, Jason --

541
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,730
<19-5,JASON>我要告诉校长
<19-5,JASON>I'm gonna tell the principal!

542
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:44,220
<19-6,CASTLE>我  那是
<19-6,CASTLE>I'm -- that was --

543
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:50,730
<20-1,PRINCIPAL SILVA>卡塞尔先生  我确定这件事情
<20-1,PRINCIPAL SILVA>Mr. Castle, I'm sure that this is being

544
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:53,430
<20-1,PRINCIPAL SILVA>被搞得过分严重了  但我实话实说
<20-1,PRINCIPAL SILVA>blown out of proportion, but I'll be candid.

545
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,880
<20-1,PRINCIPAL SILVA>杰森的父母是非常厉害的律师
<20-1,PRINCIPAL SILVA>Jason's parents are two high-powered lawyers

546
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,540
<20-1,PRINCIPAL SILVA>对起诉有着非一般的热情
<20-1,PRINCIPAL SILVA>with a zest for litigation.

547
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:01,990
<20-1,PRINCIPAL SILVA>我们刚刚决定最好还是不要惹怒他们
<20-1,PRINCIPAL SILVA>We found out a while ago that it's best not to upset them.

548
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:04,170
<20-2,CASTLE>你的意思是
<20-2,CASTLE>So what are you saying?

549
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,390
<20-3,PRINCIPAL SILVA>我们已经试过了
<20-3,PRINCIPAL SILVA>We gave this experiment a fair shot,

550
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:07,910
<20-3,PRINCIPAL SILVA>但是现在我们得向前看了
<20-3,PRINCIPAL SILVA>but now we have to move on.

551
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:12,330
<20-4,CASTLE>席尔瓦校长拜托  我只需要多一点时间
<20-4,CASTLE>Principal Silva, please -- I just need a little more time.

552
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:14,130
<20-5,PRINCIPAL SILVA>我也希望能相信你  卡塞尔先生
<20-5,PRINCIPAL SILVA>I wish that I could believe that, Mr. Castle,

553
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:16,080
<20-5,PRINCIPAL SILVA>但你在寻找目击证人这件事上
<20-5,PRINCIPAL SILVA>but have you made any progress in identifying

554
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,720
<20-5,PRINCIPAL SILVA>有什么进展吗
<20-5,PRINCIPAL SILVA>this supposed witness?

555
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,260
<20-5,PRINCIPAL SILVA>任何的进展
<20-5,PRINCIPAL SILVA>Any progress at all?

556
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,570
<21-1,RYAN>从财务情况上看不出任何线索
<21-1,RYAN>Nothing pops with this financials.

557
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,500
<21-1,RYAN>如果安东和杰菲是利用那个邮箱
<21-1,RYAN>If Anton and Jaffe were doing anything illegal

558
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,580
<21-1,RYAN>进行非法活动  他们也赚不到什么钱
<21-1,RYAN>with that P.O. box, they weren't making much money.

559
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:32,220
<21-2,BECKETT>克拉克·杰菲任职了30年
<21-2,BECKETT>Clark Jaffe put in 30 years.

560
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:35,500
<21-2,BECKETT>他受过表彰直到退休也没有任何污点记录
<21-2,BECKETT>He retired with commendations and a spotless service record.

561
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:38,090
<21-2,BECKETT>为什么像他那样的人会犯法呢
<21-2,BECKETT>Why would someone like him break the law?

562
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,970
<21-3,RYAN>对安东我也有同样的疑问
<21-3,RYAN>I'm asking the same thing about Anton.

563
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:42,330
<21-3,RYAN>我们最需要的就是卡塞尔寻找的目击证人
<21-3,RYAN>What we really need is Castle's witness.

564
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:44,080
<21-4,ESPOSITO>排查有线索了
<21-4,ESPOSITO>Yo. Canvass got a hit.

565
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,740
<21-4,ESPOSITO>邮箱存放店旁边的一个酒窖老板说
<21-4,ESPOSITO>The owner of a bodega near that mailbox store

566
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:48,230
<21-4,ESPOSITO>安东非常惊慌地进来使用了电话
<21-4,ESPOSITO>said that Anton came in all desperate to use the phone.

567
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:50,820
<21-4,ESPOSITO>-这个人让他打了电话  -给谁
<21-4,ESPOSITO>- The guy let him make a call. - To whom?

568
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,330
<22-1,ESPOSITO>这个人  德米特里·拉伦科夫
<22-1,ESPOSITO>To this guy. Dmitri Kalenkov.

569
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:55,060
<22-1,ESPOSITO>他2003年移民到美国
<22-1,ESPOSITO>He emigrated to the U.S. in '03

570
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:57,240
<22-1,ESPOSITO>有传闻说他是俄国黑手党的打手
<22-1,ESPOSITO>and is rumored to be an enforcer for the Bratva.

571
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,020
<22-2,BECKETT>俄罗斯集团犯罪
<22-2,BECKETT>Russian organized crime?

572
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:00,010
<22-2,BECKETT>等等
<22-2,BECKETT>Wait a minute.

573
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:02,070
<22-3,RYAN>那个来询问邮箱的人
<22-3,RYAN>The guy who called asking about the P.O. Box --

574
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:04,320
<22-3,RYAN>不也是俄国人吗  如果那人就是德米特里
<22-3,RYAN>Wasn't he Russian, too? What if that was Dmitri,

575
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,810
<22-3,RYAN>会不会他就是杀害杰菲和安东的凶手
<22-3,RYAN>and he's the one that took out Jaffe and Anton?

576
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,000
<22-4,BECKETT>可能他们做了一些非法的勾当
<22-4,BECKETT>Maybe they were involved in something illegal,

577
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,160
<22-4,BECKETT>不管那是什么  跟俄国犯罪团伙有关
<22-4,BECKETT>and whatever it was stepped on Russian mob turf.

578
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,090
<22-5,ESPOSITO>所以安东给德米特里打电话来调解
<22-5,ESPOSITO>So Anton called Dmitri to smooth things over.

579
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:14,860
<22-6,RYAN>结果最后胸口挨了两枪
<22-6,RYAN>And ended up taking two in the chest.

580
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:17,060
<22-6,RYAN>谢谢
<22-6,RYAN>Thanks, l.T.

581
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,140
<22-7,ESPOSITO>集团犯罪组刚拿到德米特里现在的住址
<22-7,ESPOSITO>Organized crime just got a current address on dmitri.

582
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:24,860
<23-2,BECKETT>-纽约警局  -德米特里·拉伦科夫
<23-2,BECKETT>- N.Y.P.D.! - Dmitri Kalenkov!

583
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:27,040
<23-3,ESPOSITO>-纽约警局  -举起手来  举起手来
<23-3,ESPOSITO>- N.Y.P.D.! - Hands up! Hands up!

584
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:29,480
<23-4,BECKETT>-纽约警局  -举起手来  德米
<23-4,BECKETT>- N.Y.P.D.! - Hands up, Dmi--

585
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:31,350
<23-7,ESPOSITO>这味道真是
<23-7,ESPOSITO>That smells good.

586
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:35,440
<23-8,ESPOSITO>找到他了
<23-8,ESPOSITO>Found him!

587
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:37,150
<23-8,ESPOSITO>这就是德米特里
<23-8,ESPOSITO>It's Dmitri.

588
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:41,740
<23-9,ESPOSITO>他被人枪杀了
<23-9,ESPOSITO>He's been shot.

589
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:43,430
<23-9,ESPOSITO>已经死了好几天了
<23-9,ESPOSITO>Been dead at least a couple of days.

590
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,160
<23-10,RYAN>贝克特  过来看看
<23-10,RYAN>Hey, Beckett, check it out.

591
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,050
<23-10,RYAN>电缆  汽车电池  导线
<23-10,RYAN>Electrical cable, car battery, leads.

592
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:54,240
<23-11,BECKETT>他先被折磨过
<23-11,BECKETT>He was tortured first.

593
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,290
<24-1,LANIE>某人曾在这里被折磨过
<24-1,LANIE>Well, someone might have been tortured here,

594
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:07,810
<24-1,LANIE>不过不是德米特里
<24-1,LANIE>but it wasn't Dmitri.

595
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,700
<24-2,BECKETT>你确定
<24-2,BECKETT>Are you sure?

596
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:12,170
<24-3,LANIE>我发现的伤口除了枪伤
<24-3,LANIE>The only injury I see besides bullet wounds

597
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:14,810
<24-3,LANIE>就是他脑后的钝器外伤
<24-3,LANIE>is a blunt-force trauma to the back of the head,

598
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:16,180
<24-3,LANIE>根据创面的情况来看
<24-3,LANIE>And by the look of the contusion,

599
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:19,540
<24-3,LANIE>我认为凶器是那把断掉的座椅扶手
<24-3,LANIE>I would say it was made by that broken chair arm.

600
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:21,650
<24-4,ESPOSITO>假如被折磨的不是德米特里
<24-4,ESPOSITO>So if Dmitri wasn't tortured,

601
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:23,280
<24-4,ESPOSITO>可能他就是负责折磨的人
<24-4,ESPOSITO>maybe he was the one doing the torturing.

602
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,050
<24-4,ESPOSITO>正符合他黑帮打手的身份
<24-4,ESPOSITO>It fits the profile of a mob enforcer.

603
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:27,480
<24-5,BECKETT>就是说那个被绑在椅子上的人挣脱了
<24-5,BECKETT>Which means whoever was tied into that chair broke free,

604
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,050
<24-5,BECKETT>制住了德米特里  然后枪杀了他
<24-5,BECKETT>overpowered Dmitri, and then shot him.

605
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,970
<24-5,BECKETT>他死了有多久了
<24-5,BECKETT>How long has he been dead?

606
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,620
<24-6,LANIE>至少有三天时间
<24-6,LANIE>I'd say at least three days.

607
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:37,690
<24-7,ESPOSITO>那德米特里是在杰菲和安东之前被杀的
<24-7,ESPOSITO>So Dmitri was killed before Jaffe and Anton.

608
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,800
<24-8,LANIE>而且很有可能是同一杀手所为
<24-8,LANIE>And most likely by the same shooter.

609
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,820
<24-8,LANIE>同样胸口上开了两枪
<24-8,LANIE>Same two taps to the chest.

610
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:43,290
<24-9,BECKETT>好的  谢谢
<24-9,BECKETT>Okay, thanks.

611
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,570
<24-10,BECKETT>为什么要杀害一个黑帮打手
<24-10,BECKETT>Why kill a mob enforcer,

612
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:48,570
<24-10,BECKETT>一个卖冰激凌的和一个退休警察
<24-10,BECKETT>an ice cream man, and a retired cop?

613
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,440
<24-10,BECKETT>他们到底卷入什么事情了
<24-10,BECKETT>What were they mixed up in?

614
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:49,950
<24-10,BECKETT>我不知道
<24-10,BECKETT>I don't know,

615
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:51,380
<24-11,ESPOSITO>但这看上去和俄国有很大关系
<24-11,ESPOSITO>but it's starting to look like a Russian thing.

616
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:54,020
<24-11,ESPOSITO>安东  德米特里还有那个给邮箱店打电话的人
<24-11,ESPOSITO>Anton, Dmitri, the guy who called the mailbox store.

617
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,700
<24-12,BECKETT>再和有组织犯罪调查科联系看看
<24-12,BECKETT>Okay, touch base with Organized Crime again.

618
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,910
<24-12,BECKETT>让他们查查俄罗斯社区里有什么冲突
<24-12,BECKETT>Let's see if there's a conflict in the Russian community.

619
00:25:57,910 --> 00:25:58,640
<24-12,BECKETT>好的
<24-12,BECKETT>All right.

620
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:02,340
<24-13,RYAN>是安东的父母那边
<24-13,RYAN>Hey. That was Anton's parents.

621
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,460
<24-13,RYAN>有人闯进了他们的公寓还翻了个底朝天
<24-13,RYAN>Someone just broke into their apartment and tossed the place.

622
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:06,080
<24-14,ESPOSITO>这和杰菲的住所被翻过一样
<24-14,ESPOSITO>Just like Jaffe's place was tossed.

623
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:08,290
<24-15,BECKETT>凶手正在找某个东西
<24-15,BECKETT>The killer's after something.

624
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,370
<24-15,BECKETT>某个这些被害者拥有的东西
<24-15,BECKETT>Something that our victims had.

625
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:11,930
<24-16,RYAN>是的  但是什么呢
<24-16,RYAN>Yeah, but what?

<25-1,CASTLE>Jack, you make sure you keep your guard up on that battlefield,

<25-4,CASTLE>Oh. Yeah, Emily, I gotta go.

636
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:33,730
<25-5,EMILY>是不是我害你的
<25-5,EMILY>Is it because I got you in trouble?

637
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:36,090
<25-6,CASTLE>不不  艾米丽  不是你的错
<25-6,CASTLE>Oh, no. No, Emily, that's not your fault.

<25-6,CASTLE>You make sure you use your princess powers for good, okay?

<25-7,EMILY>再见了

<25-8,CASTLE>Bye, guys.

643
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,950
<25-8,CASTLE>我从没想过我会这么说
<25-8,CASTLE>I never thought I'd say this,

644
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:56,680
<25-9,CASTLE>你要走了我心里也不舒服
<25-9,CASTLE>but I'm sorry to see you leave.

<25-9,CASTLE>谢谢你这么说  鲁伊兹女士
<25-9,CASTLE>Thank you very much, Mrs. Ruiz.

<25-10,CASTLE>-非常感谢  -保重
<25-10,CASTLE>- I appreciate that. - Take care.

649
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,970
<26-1,SERGEI>我简直无法相信我看到的
<26-1,SERGEI>I could not believe what I saw.

650
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:22,460
<26-1,SERGEI>我和我老婆吃完午饭回来之后
<26-1,SERGEI>When my wife and I got back from lunch,

651
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:23,820
<26-1,SERGEI>发现门被踹开了
<26-1,SERGEI>the door was kicked in

652
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,630
<26-1,SERGEI>整个房间被翻得一团糟
<26-1,SERGEI>and the place was torn apart.

653
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,310
<26-2,RYAN>你知不知道他们在找什么
<26-2,RYAN>Do you have any idea what they were looking for?

654
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:31,470
<26-3,SERGEI>安东房间天花板的通风孔被撬开了
<26-3,SERGEI>In Anton's room, the ceiling vent was pried open,

655
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:34,200
<26-3,SERGEI>就在下面的地板上
<26-3,SERGEI>and on the floor right below it.

656
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:36,820
<26-3,SERGEI>我发现了这个
<26-3,SERGEI>I found this.

657
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:43,210
<26-4,BECKETT>护照
<26-4,BECKETT>Passports?

658
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:48,970
<26-5,RYAN>都是空白的
<26-5,RYAN>They're blank.

659
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,760
<26-6,BECKETT>你知道安东怎么会有这些的吗
<26-6,BECKETT>What was Anton doing with these?

660
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:54,110
<26-7,SERGEI>我之前从来没见过这些
<26-7,SERGEI>I've never seen them before today.

661
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,280
<26-7,SERGEI>我的儿子究竟卷入什么事情了
<26-7,SERGEI>What was my son involved in?

662
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,430
<26-8,RYAN>他正在进修平面设计
<26-8,RYAN>He was studying graphic design.

663
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:00,010
<26-8,RYAN>你觉得他是不是在伪造护照
<26-8,RYAN>Do you think he was forging passports?

664
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:02,610
<26-9,BECKETT>维托什金先生  我想问你一下
<26-9,BECKETT>Mr. Vetotchkin, I -- I need to ask you,

665
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:05,470
<26-9,BECKETT>你见过这个人吗
<26-9,BECKETT>do you recognize this man?

666
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:09,910
<26-10,SERGEI>见过  这是德米特里  德米特里·拉伦科夫
<26-10,SERGEI>Yes, that's Dmitri. Dmitri kalenkov.

667
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,450
<26-11,BECKETT>你是怎么认识他的
<26-11,BECKETT>And how do you know him?

668
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:14,610
<26-12,SERGEI>他和我儿子一起长大的
<26-12,SERGEI>He and my son grew up together

669
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,980
<26-12,SERGEI>在阿布哈兹还在战乱的时候
<26-12,SERGEI>back in Abkhazia during the war.

670
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:21,110
<26-12,SERGEI>德米特里也和这事有关吗
<26-12,SERGEI>Is Dmitri involved in this, too?

671
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,910
<26-13,BECKETT>抱歉  稍等一下
<26-13,BECKETT>I'm sorry. Just one moment.

672
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:32,140
<26-14,CASTLE>贝克特  你得过来一下
<26-14,CASTLE>Beckett, you need to come down here.

673
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:33,220
<26-14,CASTLE>我发现了线索
<26-14,CASTLE>I found something.

674
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,720
<27-1,BECKETT>卡塞尔  把这个塞到你口袋的人...
<27-1,BECKETT>Castle, whoever put this in your pocket...

675
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,570
<27-2,CASTLE>在传达一个讯息
<27-2,CASTLE>Is sending me a message.

676
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:41,930
<27-2,CASTLE>我们的证人不太情愿出来作证
<27-2,CASTLE>Our witness is reluctant to come forward,

677
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:43,630
<27-2,CASTLE>但等他发现我要走了
<27-2,CASTLE>but when they saw I was leaving,

678
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,130
<27-2,CASTLE>他不得不有所行动
<27-2,CASTLE>it forced their hand.

679
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:48,350
<27-3,BECKETT>你有没有问过是谁画的
<27-3,BECKETT>Have you tried just asking who drew it?

680
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:49,770
<27-4,CASTLE>我不想把他吓跑了
<27-4,CASTLE>I don't want to scare them off...

681
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:52,100
<27-4,CASTLE>不过我有个计划
<27-4,CASTLE>But I have a plan.

682
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:58,800
<27-4,CASTLE>同学们  额外的休息时间到了
<27-4,CASTLE>Okay, class, time for that extra recess period

683
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:01,190
<27-4,CASTLE>这是你们表现好给你们的奖励
<27-4,CASTLE>I promised you for being extra good today.

684
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:10,020
<28-1,EMILY>我叫艾米丽  你是谁
<28-1,EMILY>I'm Emily. Who are you?

685

<28-2,BECKETT>I'm kate. I'm Mr. Castle's...friend.

686
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:16,160
<28-3,EMILY>你喜欢和他玩扮公主游戏吗
<28-3,EMILY>Do you like to play princess with him?

687
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:19,450
<28-4,BECKETT>时不时
<28-4,BECKETT>Uh...sometimes.

688
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:23,610
<28-5,EMILY>你们俩是不是要结婚
<28-5,EMILY>Are you two getting married?

689
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:26,210
<28-6,BECKETT>有一天会的
<28-6,BECKETT>One day. One day.

690
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:31,350
<28-7,CASTLE>现在机会来了  我从前面开始找
<28-7,CASTLE>Now's our chance. I'll take the front.

691
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,490
<28-7,CASTLE>你们俩从后面开始
<28-7,CASTLE>You guys take the back.

692
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,930
<28-8,BECKETT>我们找的是什么
<28-8,BECKETT>Okay, so what are we looking for?

693
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,150
<28-9,CASTLE>找一幅可能来自同一个孩子画的画
<28-9,CASTLE>A drawing that looks like it could have been made by the same kid.

694
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,380
<28-10,BECKETT>但是这些是一群二年级学生
<28-10,BECKETT>Yeah, but these are second-graders.

695
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:39,440
<28-10,BECKETT>他们的画风都差不多啊
<28-10,BECKETT>I mean, don't their drawings look the same?

696
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,630
<28-10,BECKETT>在我看来不是的  探长
<28-10,BECKETT>Not to me, detective.

697
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:42,180
<28-10,BECKETT>当你和这群孩子朝夕相处
<28-10,BECKETT>When you live and breathe these children,

698
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,230
<28-11,CASTLE>每一笔画的涂抹都是独一无二的
<28-11,CASTLE>every scribble is like a fingerprint.

699
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,580
<28-11,CASTLE>真想不到面对他们还要说这么鼓舞的话
<28-11,CASTLE>Can't imagine they'll need much prompting when we confront them.

700
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:47,710
<28-11,CASTLE>目击的事很显然已经
<28-11,CASTLE>This has clearly been eating away

701
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:49,360
<28-11,CASTLE>被他们脆弱的小心灵给侵蚀了
<28-11,CASTLE>at their delicate little psyches.

702
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:51,420
<28-11,CASTLE>给他们自我倾诉的机会
<28-11,CASTLE>Given the chance to unburden themselves --

703
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:52,590
<28-11,CASTLE>找到了
<28-11,CASTLE>Found it.

704
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:56,380
<28-12,CASTLE>那个脆弱的小心灵是谁
<28-12,CASTLE>All right. Who's our sensitive little soul?

705
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:58,210
<28-13,JASON>鲁伊兹老师
<28-13,JASON>Hey, Mrs. Ruiz,

706
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:00,260
<28-13,JASON>你为什么翻我的桌子
<28-13,JASON>why are you going through my desk?

707
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:02,330
<28-13,JASON>杰森
<28-13,JASON>Jason?

708
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:05,550
<28-14,CASTLE>你是目击证人
<28-14,CASTLE>You're the witness?

709
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,970
<29-1,JASON>我不会告诉卡塞尔先生的  他是个混球
<29-1,JASON>I'm not talking to Mr. Castle. He's a jerk-face.

710
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:14,470
<29-2,CASTLE>好吧  你知道吗
<29-2,CASTLE>Okay, you know what?

711
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,970
<29-2,CASTLE>他才是小混球
<29-2,CASTLE>He's the jerk-face.

712
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:17,140
<29-3,BECKETT>他才八岁
<29-3,BECKETT>He's 8 years old.

713
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:19,210
<29-3,BECKETT>你来这才一天半
<29-3,BECKETT>You've been here for a day and a half,

714
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:20,530
<29-3,BECKETT>这么快就拉仇恨了
<29-3,BECKETT>and you already have a nemesis?

715
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:23,080
<29-4,CASTLE>我怎么会知道他就是目击证人
<29-4,CASTLE>How was I supposed to know he'd be the witness?

716
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,580
<29-4,CASTLE>杰森
<29-4,CASTLE>Jason,

717
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:36,780
<29-5,BECKETT>我想告诉你你没惹上任何麻烦  好吗
<29-5,BECKETT>I want you to know that you're not in trouble, okay?

718
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:39,920
<29-6,JASON>我只不过是画了一幅画
<29-6,JASON>All I did was draw a picture.

719
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,980
<29-6,JASON>没错
<29-6,JASON>Ex-exactly.

720
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:46,500
<29-7,BECKETT>但是我知道你想告诉我
<29-7,BECKETT>But I know that you want to tell me

721
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:48,470
<29-7,BECKETT>关于画上的事情
<29-7,BECKETT>all about this picture.

722
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:49,960
<29-7,BECKETT>除非是因为混球在
<29-7,BECKETT>Except jerk-face over there,

723
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,510
<29-7,BECKETT>他认为你是胆小鬼所以我们应该
<29-7,BECKETT>he thinks that you're too scared and that we should

724
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:53,050
<29-7,BECKETT>打电话叫你妈妈来接你
<29-7,BECKETT>call your mom to come and pick you up.

725
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:54,740
<29-8,JASON>我才不是胆小鬼
<29-8,JASON>I'm not scared!

<29-9,BECKETT>So, listen, I need you to tell me everything that you remember seeing

728
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,570
<29-9,BECKETT>你看见的所有事情
<29-9,BECKETT>while you were hiding in this ice cream truck.

731
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:11,160
<29-11,CASTLE>会比藏在心里的感觉更好
<29-11,CASTLE>letting it out rather than keeping it in.

732
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:14,240
<29-12,JASON>不  我不能说  因为我当时不在那
<29-12,JASON>No! I can't, because I wasn't there!

<29-19,BECKETT>她是个大人
<29-19,BECKETT>She's a grownup.

<29-20,JASON>妈妈出城的时候我和她住在一起
<29-20,JASON>I stay with her when our mom goes out of town.

745
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,990
<29-21,CASTLE>那天是你把请假条给她的
<29-21,CASTLE>So you gave her your permission slip that day?

746
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:55,260
<29-22,JASON>是她让我请假的
<29-22,JASON>She dropped me off

<29-22,JASON>当她回到家时 她哭了
<29-22,JASON>When she came home, she was crying.

749
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,400
<29-22,JASON>她跟我说不能告诉任何人她去哪了
<29-22,JASON>She told me never tell anyone where she went,

750
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,020
<29-22,JASON>否则会有坏事发生
<29-22,JASON>or something bad would happen.

<29-23,BECKETT>你姐姐叫什么名字
<29-23,BECKETT>What's your sister's name?

<30-2,RYAN>我从没去过安东的卡车上
<30-2,RYAN>I was never in Anton's truck.

<31-1,NATALIE>我知道你去过  娜塔莉
<31-1,NATALIE>I know that you were, Natalie.

759
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,630
<31-2,BECKETT>你得从这些你和安东
<31-2,BECKETT>And you have to start with those passports

760
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:34,470
<31-2,BECKETT>一起伪造的护照说起
<31-2,BECKETT>that you helped Anton forge.

761
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:38,070
<31-3,BECKETT>这么说你的确牵涉其中
<31-3,BECKETT>So you were involved?

762
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:41,050
<31-4,NATALIE>我们只是想做点好事
<31-4,NATALIE>We were just trying to do something good.

763
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:42,390
<31-5,BECKETT>你说的"我们"是指谁
<31-5,BECKETT>Who do you mean by "We"?

<31-5,BECKETT>-是你  安东  杰菲吗  -是的
<31-5,BECKETT>- You, Anton, and Jaffe? - Yeah.

765
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:47,390
<31-7,BECKETT>告诉我护照的事
<31-7,BECKETT>Tell me about the passports.

766
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:49,190
<31-7,BECKETT>安东的行车路线
<31-7,BECKETT>Anton's route

767
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:51,560
<31-8,NATALIE>覆盖了布莱顿海滩
<31-8,NATALIE>covered Brighton Beach.

768
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:54,140
<31-8,NATALIE>那儿有很多俄国人
<31-8,NATALIE>There were a lot of Russians there,

769
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:57,410
<31-8,NATALIE>他看见了很多人被许诺有工作来到这
<31-8,NATALIE>and he'd seen so many of them come here with the promise of a job,

770
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:59,550
<31-8,NATALIE>然后他们的证件被拿走了
<31-8,NATALIE>and then their papers would be taken,

771
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:01,590
<31-8,NATALIE>他们被迫在血汗工厂工作
<31-8,NATALIE>and they'd be forced to work in sweatshops

772
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:03,410
<31-8,NATALIE>有的则更糟糕
<31-8,NATALIE>Or -- or worse, and --

773
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:05,610
<31-8,NATALIE>安东想让他们回家
<31-8,NATALIE>Anton was trying to get back home.

774
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,970
<31-9,BECKETT>但是他们没有合法文件他们回不去
<31-9,BECKETT>Which they couldn't do now without the right documents.

775
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:09,930
<31-10,NATALIE>是的
<31-10,NATALIE>Yeah.

776
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:13,190
<31-11,BECKETT>那杰菲是怎么卷进这件事的
<31-11,BECKETT>And how did Jaffe fit into all of this?

777
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,850
<31-12,NATALIE>安东听说杰菲可以通过关系
<31-12,NATALIE>Well, Anton heard that Jaffe had a connection

778
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:17,500
<31-12,NATALIE>拿到空白的护照
<31-12,NATALIE>that could get blank passports.

779
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,840
<31-12,NATALIE>而且杰菲在布莱顿海滩当警察
<31-12,NATALIE>And Jaffe worked Brighton Beach as a cop,

780
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,510
<31-12,NATALIE>他知道这些都是怎么回事
<31-12,NATALIE>So he knew what was going on,

781
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:24,300
<31-12,NATALIE>他同情那些移民
<31-12,NATALIE>and -- and he was sympathetic to the immigrants.

782
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:25,750
<31-13,BECKETT>而你是拥有
<31-13,BECKETT>And you were the one

783
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:27,670
<31-13,BECKETT>高科技设计软件的人
<31-13,BECKETT>with the high-tech design software.

784
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:29,370
<31-13,BECKETT>所以安东选了你的课
<31-13,BECKETT>That's why Anton took your class.

785
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,170
<31-14,NATALIE>当我发现安东的意图时
<31-14,NATALIE>When I found out what Anton was doing,

786
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:33,980
<31-14,NATALIE>我决定帮助他  因为我...
<31-14,NATALIE>I-I decided to help, 'cause I...

787
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,010
<31-14,NATALIE>我想做出改变
<31-14,NATALIE>I wanted to make a difference.

788
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:46,110
<31-15,BECKETT>我不明白这事怎么会害死人
<31-15,BECKETT>I don't understand how this got anyone killed.

789
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:50,080
<31-16,NATALIE>有天晚上  安东在班里做护照
<31-16,NATALIE>The other night, Anton was making a passport in class,

790
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,060
<31-16,NATALIE>他看见其中一个客户的照片
<31-16,NATALIE>and he saw the photo of the client,

791
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:54,540
<31-16,NATALIE>他认出了那个人  他就是...
<31-16,NATALIE>and he recognized the man. It was this --

792
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:57,260
<31-16,NATALIE>他过去认识的一个很可怕的人
<31-16,NATALIE>this terrible man from his past.

793
00:33:57,730 --> 00:33:58,460
<31-17,BECKETT>谁
<31-17,BECKETT>Who?

794
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,100
<31-18,NATALIE>安东叫他"上校"
<31-18,NATALIE>Anton called him "Polkovnik."

795
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:02,580
<31-18,NATALIE>安东很害怕他
<31-18,NATALIE>Anton was terrified of him,

796
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:05,150
<31-18,NATALIE>他说这个上校曾想杀了他
<31-18,NATALIE>said this polkovnik once tried to kill him.

797
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:07,230
<31-18,NATALIE>但安东说他必须
<31-18,NATALIE>But Anton said that he had to --

798
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:10,380
<31-18,NATALIE>把照片给一个朋友看才能确认
<31-18,NATALIE>to show the picture to a friend of his just to be sure,

799
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:13,030
<31-18,NATALIE>一个叫德米特里的人
<31-18,NATALIE>some...guy called Dmitri.

800
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:16,950
<31-19,BECKETT>娜塔莉  你在货车里都看见了什么
<31-19,BECKETT>Natalie, what did you see in that van?

801
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:20,380
<31-20,NATALIE>安东给我留了信息
<31-20,NATALIE>Anton had left a message for me

802
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:22,370
<31-20,NATALIE>让我去他的冰淇淋车那见面
<31-20,NATALIE>to meet him at his ice cream truck,

803
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,770
<31-20,NATALIE>不是他以往的路线
<31-20,NATALIE>away from his usual route.

804
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,770
<31-20,NATALIE>我到那里后  他说杰菲死了
<31-20,NATALIE>And when I got there, he said that Jaffe was dead,

805
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:30,000
<31-20,NATALIE>那个男人杀了他
<31-20,NATALIE>and that this man had killed him,

806
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,630
<31-20,NATALIE>如果我们不逃跑的话
<31-20,NATALIE>and that he was afraid that we would be next

807
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:32,870
<31-20,NATALIE>他怕我们会是下一个死的人
<31-20,NATALIE>if we didn't run.

808
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:35,160
<31-20,NATALIE>然后安东看到他过来了
<31-20,NATALIE>And then Anton saw him coming,

809
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:36,540
<31-20,NATALIE>他叫我躲起来
<31-20,NATALIE>so he told me to hide.

810
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:40,220
<31-20,NATALIE>我就眼看着
<31-20,NATALIE>And I watched.

811
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:44,040
<31-20,NATALIE>我眼看着上校开枪打死了安东
<31-20,NATALIE>I watched as polkovnik gunned Anton down.

812
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,090
<31-21,BECKETT>你看见他的脸了吗
<31-21,BECKETT>You see his face?

813
00:34:49,410 --> 00:34:50,580
<31-22,BECKETT>能描述出来吗
<31-22,BECKETT>Can you describe him?

814
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:52,600
<31-23,NATALIE>是的  我
<31-23,NATALIE>Yeah, I --

815
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:54,270
<31-23,NATALIE>比这更好
<31-23,NATALIE>I can do...better.

816
00:34:55,990 --> 00:34:56,630
<32-1,ESPOSITO>等一下  你说
<32-1,ESPOSITO>Wait a second, you're saying

817
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:58,150
<32-1,ESPOSITO>她有上校的照片吗
<32-1,ESPOSITO>she's got a picture of polkovnik?

818
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:59,980
<32-2,BECKETT>在她公寓的一个信封里
<32-2,BECKETT>Yeah, in an envelope at her apartment,

819
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:02,460
<32-2,BECKETT>还有和那个人相关的其它信息  怎么了
<32-2,BECKETT>along with other information on him -- why?

820
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:04,390
<32-3,RYAN>因为我们查过这个叫上校的人了
<32-3,RYAN>Because we looked into this guy polkovnik.

821
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:05,620
<32-4,CASTLE>简单来说  他被通缉不只是因为
<32-4,CASTLE>Suffice to say he's wanted for a lot more

822
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:07,740
<32-5,BECKETT>-杀了三个人那么简单  -在纽约吗
<32-5,BECKETT>- than just three murders. - Here in New York?

823
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:10,770
<32-6,RYAN>不  在十年前的格鲁吉亚阿布哈兹地区
<32-6,RYAN>No, in the Abkhazia region of Georgia 10 years ago.

824
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:12,990
<32-6,RYAN>他因战争罪行被国际法庭通缉
<32-6,RYAN>He's wanted by the World Court for war crimes.

825
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,880
<32-7,ESPOSITO>他曾是民兵头领  犯下暴行
<32-7,ESPOSITO>He was a militia leader, committed atrocities,

826
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,490
<32-7,ESPOSITO>血洗很多村庄  包括安东和德米特里住过的
<32-7,ESPOSITO>wiped out villages, including where Anton and Dmitri lived.

827
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:19,610
<32-7,ESPOSITO>所以他们才会逃走
<32-7,ESPOSITO>That's why they fled.

828
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:21,290
<32-7,ESPOSITO>国际刑警组织一直在追捕这个人
<32-7,ESPOSITO>Interpol's been after this guy ever since.

829
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:23,190
<32-8,CASTLE>他们得到线报说上校在纽约
<32-8,CASTLE>They got a tip that polkovnik was in New York,

830
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:24,690
<32-8,CASTLE>所以他们加强了抓捕网  但问题是
<32-8,CASTLE>so they're tightening the net. Only one problem --

831
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:25,820
<32-8,CASTLE>没有这个人的照片
<32-8,CASTLE>there's no pictures of this guy,

832
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:26,940
<32-8,CASTLE>没有人知道他长什么样子
<32-8,CASTLE>so no one knows what he looks like.

833
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,140
<32-9,RYAN>他希望可以保持这个状态
<32-9,RYAN>And he wants to keep it that way,

834
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:31,430
<32-9,RYAN>所以当德米特里试图自己伸张正义时
<32-9,RYAN>so when Dmitri tried to take justice into his own hands,

835
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:33,050
<32-9,RYAN>上校就杀了他
<32-9,RYAN>polkovnik killed him.

836
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,260
<32-9,RYAN>然后他又追踪到杰菲和安东
<32-9,RYAN>Then he tracked down Jaffe and Anton

837
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,530
<32-9,RYAN>把他们也杀了
<32-9,RYAN>and killed them, too.

838
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:37,950
<32-9,RYAN>他知道他们能够认出他来
<32-9,RYAN>He knew that they could I.D. him.

839
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:39,300
<32-10,BECKETT>那才是他要找的
<32-10,BECKETT>That's what he was looking for --

840
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,850
<32-10,BECKETT>安东准备给他做护照用的照片
<32-10,BECKETT>The picture that Anton was gonna use on his passport.

841
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:43,210
<32-11,CASTLE>他迫切需要护照
<32-11,CASTLE>A passport that he desperately needs

842
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:44,110
<32-11,CASTLE>好离开这个国家
<32-11,CASTLE>to get out of this country.

<37-7,ALEXIS>在巴黎那件事后

942
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:28,050
<37-8,CASTLE>家里的大人
<37-8,CASTLE>the adult of the family --

943

944
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:30,460
<37-10,CASTLE>非常充分的理由

945
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,370
<37-10,CASTLE>但是
<37-10,CASTLE>But...

946
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:36,920
<37-10,CASTLE>但是作为大人  就要意识到
<37-10,CASTLE>But part of being an adult is realizing

947
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:40,840
<37-10,CASTLE>你无法永远保护你爱的人
<37-10,CASTLE>you can't always protect the people you love.

00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:44,880
<37-11,ALEXIS>好吧

949

951
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:56,560
<37-14,CASTLE>而你当大人的时间太长了
<37-14,CASTLE>And you've spent way too much time having to be one.

952
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,340
<37-14,CASTLE>所以
<37-14,CASTLE>So...

00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:07,710
<37-16,ALEXIS>你不觉得我玩这个太老了吗
<37-16,ALEXIS>Don't you think I'm a little old for that?

955
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,590
<37-17,CASTLE>我都不会太老  所以
<37-17,CASTLE>I am not too old for it, so you are definitely

00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:10,420
<37-17,CASTLE>你绝对不会
<37-17,CASTLE>not too old for it.

957
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:12,110
<37-17,CASTLE>你不觉得我们至少该试试看吗
<37-17,CASTLE>Don't you think we should at least test them out?

958
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:14,260
<37-18,ALEXIS>好吧
<37-18,ALEXIS>Okay.

00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:18,920
<37-20,CASTLE>你想去哪
<37-20,CASTLE>Where do you want to go?

961
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,190
<37-21,ALEXIS>不知道呢  去吃雪糕
<37-21,ALEXIS>I don't know, ice cream?

963
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:24,650
<37-22,CASTLE>这个案子以后  我估计有段时间都不想吃雪糕了
<37-22,CASTLE>After this case, I might be off ice cream for a while.

964
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:25,790
<37-22,CASTLE>好吧
<37-22,CASTLE>Okay.
