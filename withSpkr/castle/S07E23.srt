<1-5,CASTLE>So which big head?

13

<1-8,CASTLE>Which of these should be hanging behind me

21
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:12,180
<1-8,CASTLE>挂在我身后
<1-8,CASTLE>at the ceremony next week?

23
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,550
<1-9,MARTHA RODGERS>亲爱的  你知道我从不偏颇
<1-9,MARTHA RODGERS>Darling, you know I refuse to play favorites.

24
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:19,220
<1-9,MARTHA RODGERS>我对我儿子的两个大脸的爱是一样的
<1-9,MARTHA RODGERS>I love both of my son's big heads equally.

25
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:22,020
<1-9,MARTHA RODGERS>好了  我要去见个朋友了
<1-9,MARTHA RODGERS>All right. I am off to meet a friend of mine

26
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:24,410
<1-9,MARTHA RODGERS>这位朋友的父亲刚刚去世了
<1-9,MARTHA RODGERS>whose father just passed away.

00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:27,080
<1-11,MARTHA>没事的
<1-11,MARTHA>Oh, no, no. Don't be.

29
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,170
<1-11,MARTHA>他活得很精彩
<1-11,MARTHA>He had a r-rich, full life.

30
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:33,790
<1-11,MARTHA>更重要的是  他在切尔西有栋租金管制的阁楼
<1-11,MARTHA>And, more importantly, he has a rent-controlled loft in Chelsea,

31
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:36,640
<1-11,MARTHA>我如果做得巧妙  或许能搞到手
<1-11,MARTHA>which, if I play my cards right, could be mine.

32
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:38,060
<1-11,MARTHA>再见了
<1-11,MARTHA>Bye.

33
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:41,690
<1-12,CASTLE>这就是我们都喜欢的"死亡即机遇"的精神
<1-12,CASTLE>Well, there's the "death as opportunity" spirit we all love.

34
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:44,000
<1-13,BECKETT>看来我们自己也遇到机遇了
<1-13,BECKETT>Oh, looks like we have an opportunity of our own.

35
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,800
<1-14,CASTLE>我们出发吧
<1-14,CASTLE>Let's head out.

<2-1,CASTLE>we could be New York's newest power couple.

40
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,010
<2-2,BECKETT>卡塞尔  别触霉头啊
<2-2,BECKETT>Oh, Castle, don't jinx iit.

41
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:57,080
<2-2,BECKETT>我的考试结果还没出来呢
<2-2,BECKETT>I haven't even gotten my exam results back yet.

<2-3,CASTLE>你肯定能行的
<2-3,CASTLE>You, you aced it.

43

<2-4,KEVIN RYAN>不  是那个心脏被斧子砍中的家伙
<2-4,KEVIN RYAN>No, man. It was that guy with the ax in his heart.

44
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,940
<2-4,KEVIN RYAN>他在躺椅上流血致死
<2-4,KEVIN RYAN>He bled out in the barcalounger.

45
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,250
<2-4,KEVIN RYAN>我们还喊他"苍蝇之王"呢  记得吗
<2-4,KEVIN RYAN>We called him "Lord of the Flies," remember?

46
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,410
<2-5,JAVIER ESPOSITO>不不  你错了  兄弟
<2-5,JAVIER ESPOSITO>No, no, no. You're wrong, bro.

47
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:08,120
<2-5,JAVIER ESPOSITO>是宠物店老板被妻子喂了狗那个
<2-5,JAVIER ESPOSITO>It was the pet-shop owner whose wife fed him to the dogs.

48
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,120
<2-6,BECKETT>你们吵什么呢
<2-6,BECKETT>What are you guys fighting about?

49
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,890
<2-7,RYAN>蒙哥马利警监10年前的今天
<2-7,RYAN>Uh, the first case that Captain Montgomery

50
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:12,390
<2-7,RYAN>第一次让我们做搭档查的案子
<2-7,RYAN>partnered us on 10 years ago today.

51
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,850
<2-8,CASTLE>是吗  今天是你们的纪念日啊
<2-8,CASTLE>Really? It's your manniversary?

52
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:15,030
<2-8,CASTLE>我居然都没给你们准备礼物
<2-8,CASTLE>And I didn't get you anything.

53
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:15,820
<2-9,ESPOSITO>还有时间哦
<2-9,ESPOSITO>There's still time.

54
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,080
<2-10,TROOPER COLLINS>你们是12分局的
<2-10,TROOPER COLLINS>You the folks from the 12th?

55
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,110
<2-10,TROOPER COLLINS>我是柯林斯骑警
<2-10,TROOPER COLLINS>I'm trooper Collins.

56
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,610
<2-10,TROOPER COLLINS>多谢你们能来到辖区之外
<2-10,TROOPER COLLINS>Thanks for coming out of your jurisdiction.

57
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:20,930
<2-10,TROOPER COLLINS>被害人是个无名氏
<2-10,TROOPER COLLINS>Our victim's a Jane Doe.

58
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,510
<2-10,TROOPER COLLINS>看来她是在林中遭遇攻击
<2-10,TROOPER COLLINS>It appears she was attacked in the woods

59
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:23,510
<2-10,TROOPER COLLINS>一直被追到大路上
<2-10,TROOPER COLLINS>and chased onto the road,

60
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,880
<2-10,TROOPER COLLINS>被车撞死了
<2-10,TROOPER COLLINS>where she was hit by that truck.

61
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,910
<2-10,TROOPER COLLINS>由于袭击的关系
<2-10,TROOPER COLLINS>Because of the assault,

62
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,600
<2-10,TROOPER COLLINS>我们将此案列为凶杀
<2-10,TROOPER COLLINS>we're classifying the death as a homicide.

63
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,810
<2-11,CASTLE>知道她是从哪过来的吗
<2-11,CASTLE>Any idea where she was coming from?

64
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:30,020
<2-12,TROOPER COLLINS>这里是州狩猎场
<2-12,TROOPER COLLINS>It's state game land.

65
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,280
<2-12,TROOPER COLLINS>方圆数里无人家
<2-12,TROOPER COLLINS>Not a house for miles.

66
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,090
<2-13,BECKETT>-尸体上有身份证吗  -没有
<2-13,BECKETT>- Any I.D. on the body? - No.

67
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,280
<2-14,TROOPER COLLINS>指纹也查了  没收录在案过
<2-14,TROOPER COLLINS>And we ran her prints, but they're not on file.

68
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,040
<2-14,TROOPER COLLINS>我们已经派出队伍搜索林子了
<2-14,TROOPER COLLINS>We've got our teams out there searching the woods,

69
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,120
<2-14,TROOPER COLLINS>但我们在她胸罩里找到了这个
<2-14,TROOPER COLLINS>but we found these tucked into her bra.

70
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,050
<2-15,RYAN>50块  门卡  现金收据
<2-15,RYAN>$50 bill, key card, and a cash receipt.

71
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:45,770
<2-16,TROOPER COLLINS>是城里一家咖啡店的  昨天开据的
<2-16,TROOPER COLLINS>From a coffee shop in the city, dated yesterday.

72
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:47,080
<2-17,ESPOSITO>这门卡看着像酒店的
<2-17,ESPOSITO>This card looks like a hotel key.

73
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,770
<2-18,TROOPER COLLINS>但不是这一带的酒店
<2-18,TROOPER COLLINS>But it's not from anywhere around here.

74
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:50,400
<2-18,TROOPER COLLINS>我们认为她可能是住在城里的
<2-18,TROOPER COLLINS>We think maybe she was staying in the city.

75
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,580
<2-18,TROOPER COLLINS>我们希望你们能帮忙查清她的身份
<2-18,TROOPER COLLINS>We were hoping you could help us track down who she is

76
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,680
<2-18,TROOPER COLLINS>以及她为什么会在这里
<2-18,TROOPER COLLINS>and what she was doing here.

77
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,710
<2-19,BECKETT>嗯  当然
<2-19,BECKETT>Yeah, of course.

78
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:05,820
<2-20,CASTLE>柯林斯骑警
<2-20,CASTLE>Trooper Collins?

79
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,890
<2-20,CASTLE>她脸上的伤痕
<2-20,CASTLE>These carvings on her face?

80
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:08,970
<2-21,TROOPER COLLINS>十字吗
<2-21,TROOPER COLLINS>The crosses?

81
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,350
<2-21,TROOPER COLLINS>很诡异吧
<2-21,TROOPER COLLINS>Freaky, right?

82
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:13,150
<2-21,TROOPER COLLINS>我们认为她大概是在逃离对她做下了那种事的人
<2-21,TROOPER COLLINS>We think she was maybe running from whoever did that.

83
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,350
<2-22,BECKETT>看上去像是某种仪式
<2-22,BECKETT>They look ritualistic.

84
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:16,030
<2-23,TROOPER COLLINS>是啊  还有更怪的
<2-23,TROOPER COLLINS>Yeah. And it gets freakier.

85
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,530
<2-23,TROOPER COLLINS>卡车撞上姑娘的时候
<2-23,TROOPER COLLINS>Just as that trucker hit the girl,

86
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,970
<2-23,TROOPER COLLINS>他说看到林子里冒出个东西来
<2-23,TROOPER COLLINS>he says he saw something emerge from the woods.

87
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:20,950
<2-24,CASTLE>什么东西
<2-24,CASTLE>Some thing?

88
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,090
<2-25,TROOPER COLLINS>戴面具的黑影
<2-25,TROOPER COLLINS>A dark figure wearing a mask.

89
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,260
<2-26,CASTLE>什么样的面具
<2-26,CASTLE>What kind of mask?

90
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,750
<2-27,TROOPER COLLINS>他吓得不轻  我们就没逼问
<2-27,TROOPER COLLINS>He was pretty shaken, so we didn't press.

91
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,010
<2-27,TROOPER COLLINS>等他接受过救治我们再去录完整的口供
<2-27,TROOPER COLLINS>We'll get a full statement from him once he's been treated.

92
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:28,770
<2-28,CASTLE>他人呢
<2-28,CASTLE>Where is he?

93
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:30,320
<2-29,TROOPER COLLINS>在伍德伯里的医院
<2-29,TROOPER COLLINS>At the hospital in Woodbury.

94
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:32,290
<2-29,TROOPER COLLINS>失陪  柯林斯骑警  讲
<2-29,TROOPER COLLINS>Excuse me. Trooper Collins. Go.

95
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:37,120
<2-30,CASTLE>我们得跟那个司机谈谈
<2-30,CASTLE>We need to talk to that driver.

96
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:39,180
<3-1,TRUCKER>我想刹车的
<3-1,TRUCKER>I tried to stop. I did.

97
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,850
<3-1,TRUCKER>但她实在是突然就蹿了出来
<3-1,TRUCKER>But she just came out of nowhere.

98
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:41,910
<3-2,CASTLE>沃特斯先生  骑警
<3-2,CASTLE>Mr. Walters, the trooper

99
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:44,270
<3-2,CASTLE>-说你看到了林子里的什么东西  -是的
<3-2,CASTLE>- said you saw something in the woods. - Yeah.

100
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:45,650
<3-3,TRUCKER>看上去简直不像真的
<3-3,TRUCKER>It almost didn't seem real...

101
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:47,780
<3-3,TRUCKER>像是个鬼一般
<3-3,TRUCKER>Like it was some kind of ghost.

102
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,480
<3-3,TRUCKER>特别吓人
<3-3,TRUCKER>Freaky as all hell.

103
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,820
<3-4,BECKETT>能描述一下吗
<3-4,BECKETT>Can you describe it?

104
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,740
<3-5,TRUCKER>它穿了件深色的破外衣
<3-5,TRUCKER>It wore a dark ragged coat

105
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,420
<3-5,TRUCKER>戴着面具  像是张娃娃脸
<3-5,TRUCKER>with a mask like a doll's face.

106
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,520
<3-6,CASTLE>像是瓷娃娃吗
<3-6,CASTLE>Like porcelain?

107
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,300
<3-6,CASTLE>对
<3-6,CASTLE>Yeah.

108
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:00,410
<3-7,TRUCKER>是白的  眼睛的地方是黑的
<3-7,TRUCKER>It was white, with black where the eyes should have been.

109
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,210
<3-8,CASTLE>有什么印记吗
<3-8,CASTLE>Were there markings on it?

00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,050
<3-10,CASTLE>-有  -什么样的
<3-10,CASTLE>- Yeah. - Like what?

111
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,750
<3-11,TRUCKER>像是眼睛流下的眼泪
<3-11,TRUCKER>Like streaked teardrops coming from the eyes.

112
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,080
<3-11,TRUCKER>脸是
<3-11,TRUCKER>Uh, and the... the face, it was, uh...

113
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,330
<3-12,CASTLE>被两道黑线分割开  像个十字
<3-12,CASTLE>Bisected with two black lines, like a cross.

114
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:12,590
<3-12,CASTLE>是啊

<3-17,CASTLE>Beckett, I've seen that mask before.

129
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,920
<4-1,BECKETT>这是卡车司机画的草图
<4-1,BECKETT>The sketch is from the truck driver.

130
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,840
<4-1,BECKETT>你愿意谈谈吗
<4-1,BECKETT>You ready to talk about it?

131
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,490
<4-2,CASTLE>那年我11岁
<4-2,CASTLE>I was 11 years old.

132
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:47,550
<4-2,CASTLE>我妈跟皮蓬团去做巡演了
<4-2,CASTLE>Uh, my mother was touring with "Pippin."

133
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:48,700
<4-2,CASTLE>我在新罕布什尔
<4-2,CASTLE>I was in New Hampshire,

134
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,470
<4-2,CASTLE>待在一个同学家
<4-2,CASTLE>staying with the family of a classmate

135
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:53,310
<4-2,CASTLE>跟他们一起过总统日的周末
<4-2,CASTLE>for presidents' day weekend.

136
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:57,490
<4-2,CASTLE>他们家旁边有几百亩的国有森林
<4-2,CASTLE>Their home abutted a few hundred acres of state forest

137
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:58,900
<4-2,CASTLE>叫"霍兰德森林"
<4-2,CASTLE>called Hollander's woods.

138
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:01,250
<4-2,CASTLE>大人们让我们绝不能单独进那林子
<4-2,CASTLE>We were told never to go into the woods alone.

139
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,800
<4-3,BECKETT>越是有人告诉你别去  你就越会想办法去
<4-3,BECKETT>Somebody told you not to, so you had to do it anyway.

140
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,000
<4-4,CASTLE>我走了好几个小时
<4-4,CASTLE>I walked for hours.

141
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:11,610
<4-4,CASTLE>我很冷  还彻底迷了路
<4-4,CASTLE>I was cold, completely lost.

142
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,910
<4-4,CASTLE>就是那时候  我看到了他
<4-4,CASTLE>And that's when I saw him --

143
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,860
<4-4,CASTLE>一个穿着黑衣的影子  跪在地上
<4-4,CASTLE>a figure clad in black, kneeling.

144
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:21,660
<4-4,CASTLE>过了一小会儿  他离开了
<4-4,CASTLE>And after a few moments, he left.

145
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:24,450
<4-4,CASTLE>然后我就看到她躺在地上
<4-4,CASTLE>And that's when I saw her on the ground.

146
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:25,970
<4-5,BECKETT>她
<4-5,BECKETT>"Her"?

147
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:26,990
<4-5,BECKETT>一具尸体
<4-5,BECKETT>A body.

148
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,000
<4-6,CASTLE>我这辈子见过的第一具尸体
<4-6,CASTLE>First body I ever saw.

149
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:31,790
<4-6,CASTLE>她的喉咙被撕开了
<4-6,CASTLE>Her throat had been slit,

150
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,630
<4-6,CASTLE>跟这次一样的符号
<4-6,CASTLE>and those same symbols

151
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:36,400
<4-6,CASTLE>被刻在她的额头和脸颊上
<4-6,CASTLE>were carved into her forehead and her cheeks.

152
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,290
<4-6,CASTLE>我碰了碰她的手臂
<4-6,CASTLE>I touched her arm.

153
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:41,710
<4-6,CASTLE>我还记得当时在想  真凉啊
<4-6,CASTLE>I remember thinking how cold it was.

154
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,130
<4-7,MASKED ASSAILANT>敢把你今天看到的事告诉任何人
<4-7,MASKED ASSAILANT>Tell anyone what you've seen here today,

155
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:48,960
<4-7,MASKED ASSAILANT>我会找到你  宰了你
<4-7,MASKED ASSAILANT>and I'll find you and kill you.

156
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,080
<4-7,MASKED ASSAILANT>明白吗
<4-7,MASKED ASSAILANT>Do you understand?

157
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,820
<4-8,MASKED ASSAILANT>滚
<4-8,MASKED ASSAILANT>Go!

158
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,930
<5-1,BECKETT>你觉得他为什么会放了你
<5-1,BECKETT>Why do you think he let you live?

159
00:05:58,860 --> 00:05:59,880
<5-1,BECKETT>我不知道
<5-1,BECKETT>I don't know.

160
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:01,560
<5-2,CASTLE>我一直等到返回城里
<5-2,CASTLE>I waited till I got back to the city

161
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,430
<5-2,CASTLE>就用公用电话报了警
<5-2,CASTLE>to call the police from a pay phone.

162
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,960
<5-2,CASTLE>我太害怕了  不敢让警方知道我是谁
<5-2,CASTLE>I was too scared to let them know who I was.

163
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,180
<5-3,BECKETT>那女孩是谁
<5-3,BECKETT>And who was the girl?

164
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,250
<5-4,CASTLE>奇怪的就是这个
<5-4,CASTLE>That's just the thing.

165
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,070
<5-4,CASTLE>他们带着寻尸犬搜索了整片树林
<5-4,CASTLE>They searched the woods with cadaver dogs.

166
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,730
<5-4,CASTLE>完全没找到任何尸体
<5-4,CASTLE>They never found a body.

167
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:14,110
<5-5,BECKETT>所以你也一直不知道她是谁
<5-5,BECKETT>So you never figured out who she was?

168
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:15,560
<5-6,CASTLE>我查过当地的报纸
<5-6,CASTLE>I checked local papers.

169
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,390
<5-6,CASTLE>那附近没人被报失踪
<5-6,CASTLE>No one in the area had been reported missing.

170
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:19,410
<5-6,CASTLE>等我长大了点  我还查了失踪人口
<5-6,CASTLE>When I got older, I checked with missing persons,

171
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,860
<6-2,BECKETT>甚至是联调局的数据库
<6-2,BECKETT>even the FBI database,

172
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,930
<5-6,CASTLE>想找到任何跟她特征一致的人
<5-6,CASTLE>for anyone matching her description

173
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:26,370
<5-6,CASTLE>或任何涉及到这些符号或那面具的凶案
<5-6,CASTLE>or any crimes involving those symbols or that mask,

174
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:27,820
<5-6,CASTLE>但一无所获
<5-6,CASTLE>but there was nothing.

175
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:30,600
<5-6,CASTLE>就好像那事从未发生过
<5-6,CASTLE>It's like it never happened.

176
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,290
<5-6,CASTLE>后来  我自己也开始怀疑是否真有其事了
<5-6,CASTLE>And after a while, I started to wonder if it had.

177
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,780
<5-6,CASTLE>在树林里的那天  凯特
<5-6,CASTLE>That day in the woods, kate --

178
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,890
<5-6,CASTLE>那就是我开始写犯罪小说的原动力
<5-6,CASTLE>that's why I do what I do.

179
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,840
<5-6,CASTLE>我被驱使着解开一个个谜团故事
<5-6,CASTLE>I'm driven to figure out the story

180
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,490
<5-6,CASTLE>是因为那件事我一直没能弄清
<5-6,CASTLE>because I could never figure out that one.

181
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:48,950
<5-7,BECKETT>这事你以前怎么从来没跟我说过
<5-7,BECKETT>Why didn't you ever tell me this before?

182
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:51,870
<5-8,CASTLE>可能因为我不希望它是真的吧
<5-8,CASTLE>I think I didn't want it to be real.

183
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:53,400
<5-8,CASTLE>可它是真的
<5-8,CASTLE>But it is real.

184
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:55,600
<5-8,CASTLE>他是真实存在的
<5-8,CASTLE>He's real.

185
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:57,820
<5-8,CASTLE>他以前杀过人
<5-8,CASTLE>He killed before,

186
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:01,020
<5-8,CASTLE>现在他又要开杀戒了
<5-8,CASTLE>and he just tried to kill again.

187
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:05,940
<6-1,RYAN>我问了霍兰德森林附近的警局
<6-1,RYAN>I checked with the police department near Hollander's woods.

188
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,670
<6-1,RYAN>他们的记录显示的确有一通电话
<6-1,RYAN>Their logs do show that they received a call

189
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:09,910
<6-1,RYAN>于83年2月举报有尸体
<6-1,RYAN>in February of '83 reporting a body.

190
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:12,600
<6-1,RYAN>但由于搜查一无所获  他们认为只是恶作剧
<6-1,RYAN>But after coming up empty, they assumed it was a prank.

191
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,400
<6-2,BECKETT>好吧  那联调局的数据库呢
<6-2,BECKETT>Okay, what about the FBI Database?

192
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,620
<6-3,RYAN>近30年内没有任何袭击或谋杀案
<6-3,RYAN>There's been no other occurrences in the past 30 years

193
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,500
<6-3,RYAN>出现过这种手法
<6-3,RYAN>of any assaults or murders with this MO.

194
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:23,290
<6-3,RYAN>贝克特  卡塞尔说的那件事
<6-3,RYAN>Beckett, this thing that Castle says happened,

195
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,190
<6-3,RYAN>已经过去几十年了
<6-3,RYAN>it was decades ago.

196
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,630
<6-3,RYAN>他真的确定吗
<6-3,RYAN>Is he really sure about this?

197
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:28,340
<6-4,BECKETT>我从没见他这么坚定过
<6-4,BECKETT>As sure as I've ever seen him.

198
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:30,080
<6-5,RYAN>那么  我们的无名女尸
<6-5,RYAN>So, our jane doe --

199
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,860
<6-6,BECKETT>咖啡店的收据有什么发现吗
<6-6,BECKETT>anything on that coffee-shop receipt?

200
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,150
<6-7,RYAN>有  有一个咖啡师记得见过死者
<6-7,RYAN>Yeah, a barista there remembered seeing our victim.

201
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:34,980
<6-7,RYAN>她不是常客
<6-7,RYAN>She wasn't a regular,

202
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:37,200
<6-7,RYAN>但最近几天她来过好几次
<6-7,RYAN>but she had been in several times in the past few days.

203
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,250
<6-8,BECKETT>有人跟她一起吗
<6-8,BECKETT>Was anyone with her?

204
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,610
<6-9,RYAN>没有  她都是一个人来的
<6-9,RYAN>No. She came in alone.

205
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,120
<6-9,RYAN>她总是点好饮品  找个座位
<6-9,RYAN>She'd get her drink, take a seat,

206
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,010
<6-9,RYAN>然后花好几个小时盯着窗外
<6-9,RYAN>and spend hours staring out the window.

207
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,920
<6-10,BECKETT>好吧  不如我们找人去周围问问吧
<6-10,BECKETT>Okay, why don't we set up a canvass of the neighborhood?

208
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,790
<6-10,BECKETT>也许有人知道她是谁
<6-10,BECKETT>Maybe someone there knows who she is.

209
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:48,830
<6-10,BECKETT>过了这么多年
<6-10,BECKETT>After all these years,

210
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:51,340
<6-11,RYAN>你真觉得会是同一个凶手吗
<6-11,RYAN>do you really think it could be the same killer?

211
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,350
<6-12,BECKETT>要找到他才能知道答案了
<6-12,BECKETT>We won't know until we find him.

212
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,330
<6-13,ESPOSITO>记得我们在死者身上找到的门卡吗
<6-13,ESPOSITO>That key card that we found on the victim?

213
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:58,970
<6-13,ESPOSITO>是皇后区外一家可延期汽车旅馆的
<6-13,ESPOSITO>It was tracked to an extended-stay motel out in Queens.

214
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,100
<7-1,ESPOSITO>她付的现金
<7-1,ESPOSITO>She paid cash for the room.

215
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,420
<7-1,ESPOSITO>没有出示身份证
<7-1,ESPOSITO>Didn't present an I.D.

216
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,060
<7-1,ESPOSITO>登记名是简·史密斯
<7-1,ESPOSITO>Registered as Jane Smith.

217
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,380
<7-1,ESPOSITO>我猜不是真名
<7-1,ESPOSITO>Not her real name, I'm guessing.

218
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,370
<7-2,BECKETT>那我们还是不知道她是谁
<7-2,BECKETT>So we still don't know who she is.

219
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:11,660
<7-2,BECKETT>-她入住的时候有开车吗  -没有
<7-2,BECKETT>- Did she have a car when she checked in? - No.

220
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,010
<7-3,ESPOSITO>她打车来的
<7-3,ESPOSITO>Cab dropped her off.

221
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:15,520
<7-4,BECKETT>也就是说有人把她带去了树林
<7-4,BECKETT>Which means someone took her to those woods.

222
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:17,080
<7-5,CASTLE>她在这里待了多久
<7-5,CASTLE>How long has she been staying here?

223
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,140
<7-6,ESPOSITO>两周左右
<7-6,ESPOSITO>About two weeks.

224
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:21,680
<7-6,ESPOSITO>埃斯波  查查这些抽屉
<7-6,ESPOSITO>Espo, check the drawers.

225
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,820
<8-1,BECKETT>看能不能找到什么来确定死者身份
<8-1,BECKETT>See if we can find anything to I.D. our victim.

228
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,790
<8-3,BECKETT>照片  都是同一个女人
<8-3,BECKETT>Photos. All of the same woman?

229
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:42,920
<8-4,CASTLE>再看看这个
<8-4,CASTLE>And look at this.

230
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,780
<8-5,BECKETT>车牌号
<8-5,BECKETT>License plate numbers.

231
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:46,800
<8-6,CASTLE>起码几百个
<8-6,CASTLE>Hundreds of them,

232
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,170
<8-6,CASTLE>还有每辆车注册的地址
<8-6,CASTLE>along with the registered address of each vehicle.

233
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:50,470
<8-7,BECKETT>她怎么会有这些东西
<8-7,BECKETT>Why would she have that?

234
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:51,860
<8-8,CASTLE>看看这些车牌
<8-8,CASTLE>Look at the plate numbers.

235
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,110
<8-9,BECKETT>每个都有字母X和Z
<8-9,BECKETT>Each one has the letters "X" And "Z" in it.

236
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:56,150
<8-9,BECKETT>我们的受害者在找某个特定的人
<8-9,BECKETT>Our victim was looking for someone specific.

237
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,520
<8-10,CASTLE>对  但是谁呢
<8-10,CASTLE>Yeah, but who?

238
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,520
<8-11,ESPOSITO>我知道应该去问谁了
<8-11,ESPOSITO>I think I know someone we can ask.

240
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:04,080
<9-1,FRANK MALLOY>我就知道艾玛会出事
<9-1,FRANK MALLOY>I knew something bad would happen to Emma.

241
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,190
<9-1,FRANK MALLOY>我一直想找她  想阻止她
<9-1,FRANK MALLOY>I was trying to find her, to -- to stop her.

242
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:09,900
<9-2,BECKETT>马洛伊先生  你女儿究竟来纽约干什么
<9-2,BECKETT>Mr. Malloy, what was your daughter doing in the city?

243
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,060
<9-3,FRANK>两个月前  她的一个朋友失踪了
<9-3,FRANK>Two months ago, a friend of hers disappeared.

244
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:15,490
<9-3,FRANK>艾玛想找到她
<9-3,FRANK>Emma was trying to find her.

245
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:17,460
<9-4,BECKETT>等等
<9-4,BECKETT>Wait.

246
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,770
<9-4,BECKETT>这是她的朋友吗
<9-4,BECKETT>Was this her friend?

247
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:21,730
<9-5,FRANK>是的  佐伊·艾迪森
<9-5,FRANK>Yeah. Zoey Addison.

248
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:25,440
<9-6,CASTLE>你说她消失了是什么意思
<9-6,CASTLE>And what exactly do you mean by "She disappeared"?

249
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:27,900
<9-7,FRANK>佐伊的男朋友打她
<9-7,FRANK>Zoey had a boyfriend that was beating on her.

250
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:31,020
<9-7,FRANK>所以她开了她男友的车想去艾玛那儿住
<9-7,FRANK>So she took his car and was on her way to stay with Emma.

251
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,220
<9-7,FRANK>但却没开到她那儿
<9-7,FRANK>But she never showed.

252
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,170
<9-7,FRANK>几天之后  警察发现车停在路旁
<9-7,FRANK>Couple days later, the cops found the car

253
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:36,640
<9-7,FRANK>车的散热器坏掉了
<9-7,FRANK>by the side of the road with a busted radiator...

254
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,110
<9-7,FRANK>但佐伊却不知所踪
<9-7,FRANK>But no sign of Zoey.

255
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,040
<9-8,BECKETT>-他们和她的男朋友谈过吗  -谈过
<9-8,BECKETT>- Did they talk to the boyfriend? - Oh, yeah.

256
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,720
<9-9,FRANK>但有不在场证据证实他离现场有两州之隔
<9-9,FRANK>But he was two states away with an alibi.

257
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,940
<9-9,FRANK>他报案说车被偷了
<9-9,FRANK>He reported the car stolen,

258
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,040
<9-9,FRANK>所以警方认为佐伊偷车在逃
<9-9,FRANK>so the cops just figured that Zoey was on the run

259
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,800
<9-9,FRANK>然后弃车跑了
<9-9,FRANK>and ditched it for another ride.

260
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,640
<9-9,FRANK>艾玛知道佐伊不会那样做
<9-9,FRANK>But Emma knew that Zoey wouldn't do that --

261
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,760
<9-9,FRANK>不会不辞而别
<9-9,FRANK>not without calling.

262
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,740
<9-9,FRANK>艾玛当时是收银员  她请了假
<9-9,FRANK>So Emma took a leave from her cashier's job

263
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:57,290
<9-9,FRANK>想去找她  重走她的路线
<9-9,FRANK>to try to find her, retracing her route.

264
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,190
<9-9,FRANK>艾玛在一个卡车休息站找到了目击者
<9-9,FRANK>Em found a waitress at a truck stop

265
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:01,850
<9-9,FRANK>那人看见佐伊坐进了一辆白色轿车
<9-9,FRANK>who saw Zoey get in the back of a white sedan.

266
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,800
<9-10,BECKETT>那车是纽约牌照并且有字母X和Z
<9-10,BECKETT>With New York plates containing the letters "X" And "Z"?

267
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,540
<9-10,BECKETT>是的
<9-10,BECKETT>Yeah.

268
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,820
<9-11,FRANK>那个女服务员告诉艾玛
<9-11,FRANK>The waitress told Emma it had an oval sticker

269
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,700
<9-11,FRANK>车后窗贴有椭圆的贴纸写着纽约市
<9-11,FRANK>in its back window that said "NYC."

270
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,030
<9-11,FRANK>她来纽约就是为了查这件事
<9-11,FRANK>That's what she was doing in the city.

271
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:13,860
<9-12,BECKETT>她想找到佐伊上的那辆车
<9-12,BECKETT>She was trying to track the car Zoey got into.

272
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,520
<9-12,BECKETT>马洛伊先生这片树林能让你想起什么吗
<9-12,BECKETT>Mr. Malloy, do these woods mean anything to you?

273
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,860
<9-12,BECKETT>有什么原因会让艾玛去那吗
<9-12,BECKETT>Is there any reason that Emma would be in them?

274
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,390
<9-13,CASTLE>它们有没有可能在佐伊的路线上
<9-13,CASTLE>Were they on Zoey's route, maybe?

275
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:21,670
<9-13,CASTLE>离她失踪的地方近吗
<9-13,CASTLE>Somewhere near where she disappeared?

276
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:24,330
<9-14,FRANK>佐伊来自匹兹堡  是相反的方向
<9-14,FRANK>Zoey was coming from Pittsburgh, the opposite direction.

277
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:27,100
<9-15,CASTLE>这么长时间来  都没有她的消息吗
<9-15,CASTLE>And all this time, no one's heard anything from her?

278
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,170
<9-16,FRANK>佐伊没有家人
<9-16,FRANK>Zoey didn't have family.

279
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,700
<9-16,FRANK>要不是艾玛
<9-16,FRANK>And if it wasn't for Emma,

280
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:35,760
<9-16,FRANK>根本没人知道她失踪的事
<9-16,FRANK>no one would have even known that she'd disappeared.

281
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,710
<10-1,CASTLE>这就是为什么我找不到
<10-1,CASTLE>That's why I could never find the girl

282
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,820
<10-1,CASTLE>那个我在树林里看见的女孩
<10-1,CASTLE>I saw in the woods.

283
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,780
<10-1,CASTLE>他把目标锁定在那些不被在意的人身上
<10-1,CASTLE>He targets people who won't be missed --

284
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:44,180
<10-1,CASTLE>搭便车的旅行者  被困的司机
<10-1,CASTLE>hitchhikers, stranded motorists.

285
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,420
<10-1,CASTLE>问上几个问题
<10-1,CASTLE>He asks them a couple of questions.

286
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,990
<10-1,CASTLE>如果符合这个标准  他就会杀害他们
<10-1,CASTLE>If they fit the profile, he kills them.

287
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:51,530
<10-1,CASTLE>如果不是  他就只是个好心人带他们一程
<10-1,CASTLE>And if not, he's just some good samaritan giving them a ride.

288
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:53,260
<10-1,CASTLE>所以他才没有杀了我
<10-1,CASTLE>That's why he didn't kill me.

289
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,870
<10-1,CASTLE>那样会引起注意
<10-1,CASTLE>It would have attracted attention.

290
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,210
<10-1,CASTLE>三十年了
<10-1,CASTLE>30 years.

291
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:58,150
<10-1,CASTLE>你觉得他做了多少这样的事  10次
<10-1,CASTLE>How many times do you think he did this? 10?

292
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,860
<10-1,CASTLE>20次还是100次
<10-1,CASTLE>20? 100?

293
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:02,340
<10-1,CASTLE>我早就该想办法阻止他
<10-1,CASTLE>I should have found a way to stop him.

294
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,470
<10-2,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你当时才11岁
<10-2,BECKETT>Castle, you were 11 years old.

295
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,710
<10-2,BECKETT>并且当时发生在你身上的事情很糟糕
<10-2,BECKETT>And what happened to you back then was terrible.

296
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:08,370
<10-2,BECKETT>我理解你把这次案件
<10-2,BECKETT>And I know that you're thinking of this case

297
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,950
<10-2,BECKETT>当做是驱除恶魔的一种方式
<10-2,BECKETT>as a way to exorcise those demons,

298
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:11,320
<10-2,BECKETT>但我们还不知道我们面临的是什么
<10-2,BECKETT>but we don't know what we have here.

299
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,330
<10-2,BECKETT>我们甚至不知道这是不是同一人所为
<10-2,BECKETT>We don't even know if this is the same person.

300
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:15,200
<10-3,CASTLE>当然是同一个人
<10-3,CASTLE>Of course it's the same person.

301
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:18,180
<10-3,CASTLE>艾玛一定是做了我没有做的事
<10-3,CASTLE>See, Emma must have been able to do what I never could.

302
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,550
<10-3,CASTLE>她找到了这个人
<10-3,CASTLE>She tracked him down.

303
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,280
<10-3,CASTLE>这就是为什么他找上了艾玛
<10-3,CASTLE>That's why he went after her.

304
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,530
<10-3,CASTLE>我必须把这人找出来  凯特
<10-3,CASTLE>I have to find this guy, Kate.

305
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,080
<10-3,CASTLE>我得给这事画上句号
<10-3,CASTLE>I need to end this.

306
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:29,900
<10-4,BECKETT>伙计们  有没有什么办法
<10-4,BECKETT>Guys, is there any way

307
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,980
<10-4,BECKETT>能查到30年前的警方记录
<10-4,BECKETT>to check police records from 30 years ago?

308
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,090
<10-4,BECKETT>看有没有任何被丢弃的汽车
<10-4,BECKETT>See if there were any abandoned cars

309
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:36,950
<10-4,BECKETT>在霍兰德森林50英里范围内收到过罚单
<10-4,BECKETT>ticketed within a 50-mile radius of Hollander's woods?

310
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,500
<10-5,ESPOSITO>当然  我们只需要打给
<10-5,ESPOSITO>Sure. We just have to call

311
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,550
<10-5,ESPOSITO>那一地区的所有市政警察部门
<10-5,ESPOSITO>all the municipal police departments in the area...

312
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,020
<10-6,RYAN>等着他们嘲笑完
<10-6,RYAN>And wait for them to stop laughing long enough

313
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:45,920
<10-6,RYAN>跪求他们去布满灰尘的储存室里找一找
<10-6,RYAN>to beg them to check their dusty storage rooms.

314
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:48,350
<10-6,RYAN>-你是认真的吗  -我们必须
<10-6,RYAN>- You serious? - We need to

315
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:49,660
<10-7,BECKETT>知道我们现在面对的是怎样的情况
<10-7,BECKETT>know exactly what we're dealing with here,

316
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,690
<10-7,BECKETT>所以  二位纪念日愉快了
<10-7,BECKETT>so happy manniversary.

317
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:56,160
<10-8,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>贝克特探长  借一步说话
<10-8,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>Detective Beckett. A word?

318
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,690
<11-1,GATES>-关一下门  -好的
<11-1,GATES>- Close the door. - Oh, yeah.

319
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:04,250
<11-2,GATES>我刚接到总局的电话
<11-2,GATES>I just got a call from 1pp.

320
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,910
<11-2,GATES>他们想让我今晚放你的假
<11-2,GATES>They want me to take you off shift tonight

321
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,590
<11-2,GATES>去做绩效评估
<11-2,GATES>for a performance review.

322
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:08,970
<11-3,BECKETT>警监
<11-3,BECKETT>Um, sir,

323
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:11,650
<11-3,BECKETT>我的绩效评估是在三个月后
<11-3,BECKETT>my review's not scheduled for another three months.

324
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,350
<11-3,BECKETT>你觉得
<11-3,BECKETT>D-do you think that this has something

325
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,170
<11-3,BECKETT>这和警监的考试有关吗
<11-3,BECKETT>to do with the captain's exam?

326
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:18,280
<11-4,GATES>不会  他们不会要求会面讨论考试结果
<11-4,GATES>No, they don't ask for a meet to discuss exam results.

327
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,680
<11-4,GATES>那是发邮件通知你的
<11-4,GATES>They notify you by mail.

328
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:22,590
<11-5,BECKETT>那到底是怎么回事
<11-5,BECKETT>So w-what's going on?

329
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:25,100
<11-6,GATES>我不清楚  我认识的人都不知情
<11-6,GATES>I don't know, and none of my sources are talking.

330
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,400
<11-6,GATES>他们让你七点半赶到那
<11-6,GATES>But they want you there at 7:30.

331
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,400
<12-1,CASTLE>很有可能是好消息
<12-1,CASTLE>Well, maybe it's good news.

332
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,930
<12-1,CASTLE>也许你也得奖了
<12-1,CASTLE>Maybe you're getting an award, too --

333
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:34,020
<12-1,CASTLE>凶杀组杰出成就奖
<12-1,CASTLE>"Career Achievement in Homicide."

334
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,440
<12-2,CASTLE>好吧  也许也不是
<12-2,CASTLE>Yeah, okay, it's probably not that.

335
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,870
<12-2,CASTLE>但还是有可能是好消息
<12-2,CASTLE>But, still, it could be good news.

336
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:40,340
<12-3,BECKETT>那为什么我的警察直觉告诉我这是坏事
<12-3,BECKETT>Well, then why is my cop sense telling me it's bad?

337
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:42,450
<12-4,TORY ELLIS>伙计们  有线索了
<12-4,TORY ELLIS>Hey, guys. Got something.

338
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:45,900
<12-4,TORY ELLIS>我在查艾玛清单上的列出车牌号
<12-4,TORY ELLIS>I was running those license plates on Emma's list,

339
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:48,130
<12-4,TORY ELLIS>看这些车主是否有犯罪史
<12-4,TORY ELLIS>seeing if any of the owners have criminal backgrounds,

340
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:50,760
<13-1,TORY>我发现这辆车登记的地址
<13-1,TORY>when I noticed this car registered to an address

341
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,390
<13-1,TORY>和艾玛被杀害当天去过的那家咖啡店
<13-1,TORY>right down the street from the coffee shop

342
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:54,630
<13-1,TORY>在同一条街上
<13-1,TORY>where Emma went the day she was killed.

343
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,730
<13-2,CASTLE>她在监视那辆车
<13-2,CASTLE>She was surveilling that car.

344
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:58,290
<13-3,BECKETT>她肯定认为这辆车
<13-3,BECKETT>She must have thought it was the one

345
00:12:58,290 --> 00:12:59,910
<13-3,BECKETT>就是佐伊在卡车休息站上的那辆车
<13-3,BECKETT>that Zoey got into at the truck stop.

346
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,300
<13-4,CASTLE>当这辆车的车主意识到艾玛在追查他时
<13-4,CASTLE>And when the owner of the car realized she was onto him,

347
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,990
<13-5,BECKETT>-他就找上了她  -这是谁的车
<13-5,BECKETT>- he went after her. - Whose car is it?

348
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:06,490
<13-6,TORY>这就是奇怪的地方  车主是这名女性
<13-6,TORY>That's the weird thing. It belongs to this woman.

349
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:08,130
<13-7,BECKETT>康妮·刘易斯
<13-7,BECKETT>Connie Lewis.

350
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:10,910
<13-8,TORY>她已经72岁并且没有犯罪记录
<13-8,TORY>But she's 72 and has no criminal record.

351
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:12,110
<13-9,BECKETT>她的地址是什么
<13-9,BECKETT>What's her address?

352
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,120
<14-1,CASTLE>就是这了
<14-1,CASTLE>There it is.

353
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:16,800
<14-1,CASTLE>白色轿车  车牌有X和Z
<14-1,CASTLE>White sedan, "X" And "Z" in the plate,

354
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:18,690
<14-1,CASTLE>车窗上有纽约市的贴纸
<14-1,CASTLE>"NYC" Sticker in the window.

355
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:20,620
<14-1,CASTLE>就和艾玛找到的目击者描述的一样
<14-1,CASTLE>Exactly as Emma's witness described.

356
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,410
<14-2,BECKETT>但是一个72岁的女性
<14-2,BECKETT>Yeah, but how's a 72-year-old woman

357
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:24,120
<14-2,BECKETT>怎么会和这一切有关呢
<14-2,BECKETT>connected to all of this?

358
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:27,840
<14-3,BECKETT>你还好吗
<14-3,BECKETT>You okay?

359
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,510
<14-4,CASTLE>这么多年了  我也许终于要得到答案了
<14-4,CASTLE>After all these years, I may finally get some answers.

360
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,560
<14-4,CASTLE>刘易斯太太
<14-4,CASTLE>Mrs. Lewis?

361
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,350
<15-1,BECKETT>纽约警察
<15-1,BECKETT>NYPD.

362
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:37,950
<15-2,CASTLE>门没锁
<15-2,CASTLE>It's open.

363
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,440
<15-2,CASTLE>电视开着
<15-2,CASTLE>TV's on.

364
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:44,040
<15-2,CASTLE>刘易斯夫人  能听见吗
<15-2,CASTLE>Mrs. Lewis, can you hear me?!

365
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:56,940
<15-4,BECKETT>刘易斯夫人
<15-4,BECKETT>Mrs. Lewis?

366
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:03,830
<15-4,BECKETT>刘易斯夫人
<15-4,BECKETT>Mrs. Lewis?

367
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,870
<15-4,BECKETT>刘易斯夫人
<15-4,BECKETT>Mrs. Lewis?

368
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:09,960
<15-4,BECKETT>刘易斯夫人
<15-4,BECKETT>Mrs. Lewis?

369
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:18,300
<16-1,LANIE PARISH>表面并没有外伤
<16-1,LANIE PARISH>There were no outward signs of trauma

370
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,620
<16-1,LANIE PARISH>皮肤上也没有伤痕
<16-1,LANIE PARISH>or carvings in her skin.

371
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,110
<16-1,LANIE PARISH>但在我回去给她验尸之前
<16-1,LANIE PARISH>But until I get her back to the morgue,

372
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,460
<16-1,LANIE PARISH>还不能排除谋杀的可能
<16-1,LANIE PARISH>we can't rule out homicide.

373
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:23,740
<16-2,CASTLE>她死了多长时间了
<16-2,CASTLE>How long has she been dead?

374
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,620
<16-3,LANIE>根据腐烂程度  我想应该有三年了
<16-3,LANIE>Based on decay, I'd say about three years.

375
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,050
<16-4,BECKETT>怎么会没人发现呢
<16-4,BECKETT>How did no one notice?

376
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:30,250
<16-5,CASTLE>凶手发现了  所以用了她的车
<16-5,CASTLE>The killer did, and he used her car.

377
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,580
<16-6,BECKETT>或许还用了她家
<16-6,BECKETT>And maybe her place.

379
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,900
<16-7,ESPOSITO>看看我在厨房里发现了什么
<16-7,ESPOSITO>Look what I found in the kitchen.

381
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:40,170
<16-8,BECKETT>和我们在艾玛酒店房间里发现的火柴盒一样
<16-8,BECKETT>The same matchbook that we found in Emma's hotel room.

382
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,490
<16-9,CASTLE>如果艾玛在跟踪凶手
<16-9,CASTLE>If Emma was tailing the killer,

383
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:42,620
<16-9,CASTLE>她可能跟着他去过那里
<16-9,CASTLE>she could have followed him there.

384
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,840
<16-10,RYAN>我找到了刘易斯的亲属
<16-10,RYAN>I tracked down Lewis' next of kin.

385
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,120
<16-10,RYAN>唯一的亲人是她儿子
<16-10,RYAN>Only family listed is a son.

386
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,790
<16-10,RYAN>在她的东西里找到了他的号码
<16-10,RYAN>Found this number for him in her things.

387
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,550
<16-11,BECKETT>区号是910  是哪的
<16-11,BECKETT>910 area code? Where's that from?

388
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:53,030
<16-12,RYAN>-北卡罗来纳州  -好的
<16-12,RYAN>- North Carolina. - Okay.

389
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:55,490
<16-13,BECKETT>我来通知他  看看他知道些什么
<16-13,BECKETT>I'll handle the notification, see what he knows.

390
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,440
<16-14,CASTLE>都三年没见了  肯定知道的不多
<16-14,CASTLE>Not much, if he hasn't seen her in three years.

391
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:00,450
<16-14,CASTLE>他这做儿子的怎么三年都不来看他母亲
<16-14,CASTLE>What kind of a son doesn't check on his own mother?

392
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:01,760
<16-15,RYAN>不是所有的家庭和和睦相处的
<16-15,RYAN>Not all families get along.

394
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,890
<16-15,RYAN>我父亲有二十多年没跟他兄弟说过一句话
<16-15,RYAN>My father didn't talk to his brother for 20 years.

395
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,610
<17-1,ESPOSITO>是空的
<17-1,ESPOSITO>It's empty.

396
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,110
<17-2,BECKETT>检查一下电话
<17-2,BECKETT>Check for the phone.

397
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,450
<17-3,CASTLE>被移动过
<17-3,CASTLE>It's been moved.

398
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,660
<17-4,BECKETT>里面的人  把武器放下
<17-4,BECKETT>You inside, drop your weapon!

399
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,530
<17-5,BECKETT>地上有个洞
<17-5,BECKETT>There's a hole in the floor.

400
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:41,180
<17-5,BECKETT>各位  他在下面  我们走
<17-5,BECKETT>You guys, he's below us. Let's go!

401
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,340
<18-1,ESPOSITO>诺亚·刘易斯  52岁
<18-1,ESPOSITO>Noah Lewis. 52.

402
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,260
<18-1,ESPOSITO>90年代时在部队打杂工
<18-1,ESPOSITO>He did a stint in the army back in the '90s.

403
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,210
<18-1,ESPOSITO>最近一段时间没有工作记录
<18-1,ESPOSITO>There's no recent records about employment.

404
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:13,420
<18-1,ESPOSITO>他跟邻居说他母亲卧床不起
<18-1,ESPOSITO>He told the neighbors that his mother was bedridden

405
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,770
<18-1,ESPOSITO>由他来照顾
<18-1,ESPOSITO>and that he was taking care of her.

406
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:16,920
<18-2,BECKETT>所以他们觉得他是个孝顺儿子
<18-2,BECKETT>So they just assumed that he was the good son.

407
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,890
<18-3,ESPOSITO>是的  不过他们的关系很不好
<18-3,ESPOSITO>Yeah, but the relationship was far from rosy.

408
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:20,550
<18-3,ESPOSITO>四年前  他母亲把他送进了
<18-3,ESPOSITO>Four years ago, his mother had him committed

409
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:22,020
<18-3,ESPOSITO>一家州立精神病院
<18-3,ESPOSITO>to a state mental institution

410
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,370
<18-3,ESPOSITO>起因是他用刀威胁她
<18-3,ESPOSITO>after he threatened her with a knife.

411
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,570
<18-3,ESPOSITO>所以我跟当时受指派医治他的医生
<18-3,ESPOSITO>So I got in touch with the state-appointed shrink

412
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:26,280
<18-3,ESPOSITO>取得了联系
<18-3,ESPOSITO>who's treating him.

413
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,800
<18-3,ESPOSITO>他说诺亚有边缘型人格障碍
<18-3,ESPOSITO>he says that Noah has borderline personality disorder

414
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,420
<18-3,ESPOSITO>伴有暴力倾向
<18-3,ESPOSITO>and exhibited violent tendencies.

415
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,090
<18-3,ESPOSITO>那就是他了
<18-3,ESPOSITO>So it's him.

416
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,250
<18-4,CASTLE>有没有记录显示他三十年前在哪里
<18-4,CASTLE>Any record of where he was 30 years ago?

417
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,670
<18-5,ESPOSITO>我们更关注的是他现在在哪
<18-5,ESPOSITO>Well, we're a little bit more focused on where he is now.

418
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:38,850
<18-5,ESPOSITO>有几队人正在附近搜索
<18-5,ESPOSITO>We have teams still combing the neighborhood.

419
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:40,800
<18-5,ESPOSITO>也发了通告  可到目前什么都没查到
<18-5,ESPOSITO>We put out a BOLO. But so far, nothing.

420
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,570
<18-6,RYAN>你对凶手作案模式的看法好像真对了
<18-6,RYAN>Your theory about the killer's M.O. may have just paid off.

421
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:44,400
<18-7,BECKETT>你发现什么了吗
<18-7,BECKETT>You found something?

422
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,420
<18-8,RYAN>是的  1983年的二月份
<18-8,RYAN>Yeah, from February of '83.

423
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,960
<18-8,RYAN>在你发现那具尸体的第二天
<18-8,RYAN>The day after you saw that body,

424
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:50,350
<18-8,RYAN>警察给一辆遗弃的皮卡车贴了罚单
<18-8,RYAN>police ticketed an abandoned pickup truck

425
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:53,070
<18-8,RYAN>车是在霍兰德森林附近的路边被发现的
<18-8,RYAN>they saw by the roadside near Hollander's Woods.

426
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:54,510
<18-8,RYAN>那辆车的主人是个农民
<18-8,RYAN>The truck belonged to a farmer

427
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:57,060
<18-8,RYAN>把车借给了一个来工作的年轻女移民
<18-8,RYAN>who'd loaned it to a young woman, a migrant worker,

428
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,760
<18-8,RYAN>她要外出买点东西
<18-8,RYAN>to go out and make a supply run.

429
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,180
<18-8,RYAN>当警察通知那个农民找到了他的车时
<18-8,RYAN>When the cops told the farmer that they'd found his truck,

430
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:03,750
<18-8,RYAN>他只是以为她逃走了
<18-8,RYAN>he assumed that she'd just run off.

431
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:06,550
<18-9,CASTLE>所以他也没报失踪
<18-9,CASTLE>So he never reported her missing.

432
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:09,230
<18-10,RYAN>是的  他不想跟移民局惹上麻烦
<18-10,RYAN>No. He didn't want to get her in trouble with immigration.

433
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:11,110
<18-11,CASTLE>他还记得那个女人是谁吗
<18-11,CASTLE>Did he remember who she was?

434
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:11,820
<18-11,CASTLE>是的
<18-11,CASTLE>Yeah.

435
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,730
<18-12,RYAN>他还有一张照片
<18-12,RYAN>And he had a photo.

436
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,900
<18-13,CASTLE>她叫什么名字
<18-13,CASTLE>What was her name?

437
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:25,330
<18-14,RYAN>罗莎莉塔·坎波
<18-14,RYAN>Rosalita Campo.

438
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:27,990
<18-15,ESPOSITO>我们会再查一下诺亚
<18-15,ESPOSITO>We'll dig deeper into Noah,

439
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,460
<18-15,ESPOSITO>看看他在三十年前跟那个地方有没有交集
<18-15,ESPOSITO>see if we can connect him to that area 30 years ago.

440
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,100
<18-16,BECKETT>我们会找到他的  卡塞尔
<18-16,BECKETT>We'll find him, Castle.

441
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:36,500
<18-16,BECKETT>我保证
<18-16,BECKETT>I promise.

442
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,280
<18-16,BECKETT>我要去进行评估了
<18-16,BECKETT>I'm supposed to head off to my review.

443
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:40,140
<18-16,BECKETT>你需要我推迟一下吗
<18-16,BECKETT>Do you want me to postpone?

444
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,800
<18-17,CASTLE>不用  我应该跟你一起去的
<18-17,CASTLE>No. I should go with you.

445
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,770
<18-18,BECKETT>我一个人能行
<18-18,BECKETT>I'll be all right.

446
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,260
<18-18,BECKETT>结束后我会打给你  好吗
<18-18,BECKETT>I'll call you when I'm done, okay?

447
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,100
<18-19,CASTLE>好的

00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:46,490
<18-20,BECKETT>-再见  -再见
<18-20,BECKETT>- Bye. - Bye.

<19-3,CASTLE>No, I was just...

453
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,780
<19-3,CASTLE>在看一些我很久前写的东西
<19-3,CASTLE>reading something I wrote a long time ago.

454
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:24,220
<19-4,ALEXIS>老爸  你知道的时候有多大
<19-4,ALEXIS>Dad, how old were you when you knew?

<19-7,CASTLE>Since I was a kid, I guess. Why?

<19-8,ALEXIS>I'm finishing my junior year,

459
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,580
<19-8,ALEXIS>可我还不知道我想做什么
<19-8,ALEXIS>and I have no idea what I want to do.

460
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,220
<19-8,ALEXIS>你在我这个年龄的时候
<19-8,ALEXIS>By the time you were my age,

<19-8,ALEXIS>How can I be amazing

<21-8,KAUFMAN>在洛杉矶  你调查了一起
<21-8,KAUFMAN>In Los Angeles, you investigated a case

<21-8,KAUFMAN>-不属于你管辖的案件  -但是...

497
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,830
<21-10,KAUFMAN>利用你的职权向布莱肯议员
<21-10,KAUFMAN>You used your badge to pursue a personal vendetta

498
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,910
<21-10,KAUFMAN>报私仇  跨过法律界限
<21-10,KAUFMAN>against Senator Bracken, crossing the line

499
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:37,450
<21-10,KAUFMAN>无数次置他人生命于危险
<21-10,KAUFMAN>and endangering the lives of others numerous times.

500
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:38,680
<21-11,BECKETT>长官  那个人是杀人犯
<21-11,BECKETT>Sir, that man was a murderer.

<21-12,KAUFMAN>你曾经向上级隐瞒案件信息
<21-12,KAUFMAN>You've withheld case information from superiors

502
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,880
<21-12,KAUFMAN>只要愿意就公然蔑视当局权威
<21-12,KAUFMAN>and flown in the face of authority whenever it suits you,

503
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,300
<21-12,KAUFMAN>更不要说你和理查德·卡塞尔的工作关系
<21-12,KAUFMAN>not to mention your working relationship with Richard Castle.

504
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,560
<21-12,KAUFMAN>告诉我  探长  你有多少次
<21-12,KAUFMAN>Tell me, Detective, how often have you let

505

<21-12,KAUFMAN>因你对你丈夫的私人感情
<21-12,KAUFMAN>your personal feelings for your husband

506

507
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:53,180
<21-13,BECKETT>长官  你说的不对  我从没有...
<21-13,BECKETT>Sir, that is unfair. I never let --

508
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:55,370
<21-14,KAUFMAN>当他失踪之后  你利用职权
<21-14,KAUFMAN>And when he went missing, you used your position

509
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:57,150
<21-14,KAUFMAN>和大量纳税人的钱
<21-14,KAUFMAN>and a great deal of the taxpayers' money

510
00:20:57,150 --> 00:21:00,140
<21-14,KAUFMAN>以及同僚警探们的帮助来搜寻他
<21-14,KAUFMAN>to search for him, enlisting the aid of fellow detectives.

511
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:04,080
<21-14,KAUFMAN>而且  你早就臭名昭著了  因为你是
<21-14,KAUFMAN>And, well, you are infamous for being the inspiration

512
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,670
<21-14,KAUFMAN>虚构的纽约警局探长妮基·希特的原型
<21-14,KAUFMAN>for the fictional NYPD detective Nikki Heat,

513
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:08,700
<21-14,KAUFMAN>你和她一样  不干正事的时间
<21-14,KAUFMAN>who spends more time on her back

514
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:10,990
<21-14,KAUFMAN>比追捕嫌犯的时间还要多
<21-14,KAUFMAN>than she does pursuing killers.

515
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,080
<21-15,KAUFMAN>贝克特探长  你凭什么领导别人
<21-15,KAUFMAN>Detective Beckett, how do you expect to lead

516
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:17,950
<21-15,KAUFMAN>或是继续干你现在这份工作
<21-15,KAUFMAN>or even continue in your current job

517
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:20,860
<21-15,KAUFMAN>很明显你经常做出错误的判断
<21-15,KAUFMAN>when it's clear you've exercised such poor judgment?

518
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:22,420
<21-16,BECKETT>长官  如果你看过我的档案...
<21-16,BECKETT>Sir, if you would look at my record --

519
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:24,100
<21-17,KAUFMAN>我们现在就看着呢
<21-17,KAUFMAN>We are looking at your record.

520
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:26,290
<21-17,KAUFMAN>你根本没有做警监的资格
<21-17,KAUFMAN>You are not qualified for a captaincy,

521
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,440
<21-17,KAUFMAN>在我看来...
<21-17,KAUFMAN>and in my opinion...

522
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:31,030
<21-17,KAUFMAN>你连做探长的资格都没有
<21-17,KAUFMAN>You are not qualified to be a detective.

523
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,610
<21-18,KAUFMAN>谢谢  你可以走了
<21-18,KAUFMAN>Thank you. You can go.

524
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,880
<21-19,BECKETT>你说错了  长官
<21-19,BECKETT>You're wrong, sir.

525
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:53,810
<21-20,KAUFMAN>你说什么
<21-20,KAUFMAN>Excuse me?

526
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:55,300
<21-20,KAUFMAN>我说  "你说错了"
<21-20,KAUFMAN>I said, "You're wrong."

527
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:58,720
<21-21,BECKETT>你看过的每一个案件
<21-21,BECKETT>In every case you have referenced,

528
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:02,490
<21-21,BECKETT>我不仅成功地把凶手捉拿归案
<21-21,BECKETT>I have not only successfully brought the killer to justice,

529
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,360
<21-21,BECKETT>更是怀着对法律  对我所代表的警局
<21-21,BECKETT>but I did so with the utmost respect for the law

530
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,350
<21-21,BECKETT>最深的敬意
<21-21,BECKETT>and for the department I represent.

531
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,410
<21-21,BECKETT>至于我和卡塞尔先生的关系
<21-21,BECKETT>And regarding my relationship with Mr. Castle,

532
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:12,360
<21-21,BECKETT>事实证明他是个非常出色的搭档
<21-21,BECKETT>He has proven to be a brilliant partner

533
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:13,920
<21-21,BECKETT>而且他总是支持着我
<21-21,BECKETT>and he's always had my back.

534
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:19,320
<21-21,BECKETT>至于他以我虚构出的角色
<21-21,BECKETT>And as for his...fictional representation of me,

535
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,220
<21-21,BECKETT>我很自豪能够成为他的灵感来源
<21-21,BECKETT>I'm proud to have been his inspiration,

536
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,490
<21-21,BECKETT>作为他的妻子我也很骄傲
<21-21,BECKETT>and I am proud to be his wife.

537
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:27,950
<21-21,BECKETT>你问我  "我凭什么领导别人"
<21-21,BECKETT>You asked, "How do I expect to lead?"

538
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:30,030
<21-21,BECKETT>就凭我只做正确的事情
<21-21,BECKETT>By continuing to fight for what's right,

539
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:31,390
<21-21,BECKETT>而不是做简单的事情
<21-21,BECKETT>not for what's easy.

540
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:33,780
<21-21,BECKETT>我工作的职责是保护纽约的市民
<21-21,BECKETT>My job is to protect the citizens of New York,

541
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:36,850
<21-21,BECKETT>我会比其他所有人都要努力做好这份工作
<21-21,BECKETT>and I will do it by doing my job better than anyone else

542
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:38,240
<21-21,BECKETT>并取得成果
<21-21,BECKETT>and getting results.

543
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,660
<21-21,BECKETT>我从不越过界限
<21-21,BECKETT>I don't cross the line.

544
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,890
<21-21,BECKETT>我把自己至于界限之上
<21-21,BECKETT>I put myself on it.

545
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:44,630
<21-21,BECKETT>如果你还有什么问题的话
<21-21,BECKETT>And if you have any other questions,

546
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:45,910
<21-21,BECKETT>那你可以去问问那些
<21-21,BECKETT>then you can ask the families

547
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,970
<21-21,BECKETT>我帮助过的被害人家属
<21-21,BECKETT>of the victims that I have served.

548
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,520
<21-21,BECKETT>贝克特探长
<21-21,BECKETT>Detective Beckett.

<21-22,PAUL GIBNEY>Sit down.

550
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:05,920
<21-23,GIBNEY>那真是个慷慨有力的回答
<21-23,GIBNEY>That was an impassioned and powerful response.

551
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,340
<21-23,GIBNEY>事实上  这也正是我们期望看到的
<21-23,GIBNEY>In fact, it was exactly what we were hoping for.

552
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:10,740
<21-24,KAUFMAN>这其实并不是表现评估
<21-24,KAUFMAN>This wasn't a performance review.

553
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,570
<21-25,BECKETT>那你为什么要像那样攻击我
<21-25,BECKETT>Then why would you attack me like that?

554
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:15,650
<21-26,KAUFMAN>我们想看看你能否为自己辩护
<21-26,KAUFMAN>We wanted to see if you could defend yourself.

555

<21-26,KAUFMAN>凯特  这是个测试
<21-26,KAUFMAN>Kate, this was an audition.

556
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,330
<21-27,BECKETT>为什么测试
<21-27,BECKETT>For what?

557
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:19,660
<21-28,GIBNEY>为你的未来
<21-28,GIBNEY>Your future.

<21-28,GIBNEY>You know it.

563
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:32,940
<21-28,GIBNEY>这也是你去华盛顿以及参加警监考核的原因
<21-28,GIBNEY>It's why you went to D.C., why you took the captain's exam.

564
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,590
<21-28,GIBNEY>你想要一个更大的舞台
<21-28,GIBNEY>You want a bigger stage,

570
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:51,980
<22-2,BECKETT>他们说这还只是个开始
<22-2,BECKETT>And they say it's just the start.

571
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:55,050
<22-2,BECKETT>他们好像关注我已经有一段时间了
<22-2,BECKETT>Apparently the party has had their eye on me for a while now.

572
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:57,550
<22-2,BECKETT>他们认为大家想找像我这样的人
<22-2,BECKETT>They think that people are looking for someone like me.

575
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:03,460
<22-4,BECKETT>我是个警察  不是政客
<22-4,BECKETT>I'm a cop, not a politician.

576
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:06,040
<22-4,BECKETT>我有没有跟你说过
<22-4,BECKETT>Did I ever tell you

577
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,140
<22-4,BECKETT>我小时候曾经参加过模拟联合国
<22-4,BECKETT>that I was in a model U.N. when I was a kid?

578
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,900
<22-5,BECKETT>有次我妈担任在场监护人
<22-5,BECKETT>My mom was one of the chaperones.

579
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:14,450
<22-5,BECKETT>看过我的表现后  她说"你知道吗  小凯"
<22-5,BECKETT>And after watching me, she said, "You know, Katie...

580
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:18,560
<22-5,BECKETT>你长大之后想做什么都可以

583
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:26,000
<22-6,CASTLE>你已经做到了
<22-6,CASTLE>And you have.

584
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:30,680
<22-6,CASTLE>现在的问题是  你能否做得更大
<22-6,CASTLE>The question now is, can you make a bigger difference?

585
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:32,280
<22-7,BECKETT>卡塞尔  如果你看到了
<22-7,BECKETT>Castle, if you saw the way

586
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,800
<22-7,BECKETT>他们在里面是如何奚落我的...
<22-7,BECKETT>that they attacked me in that room...

587
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,740
<22-7,BECKETT>等竞选时  只会变本加厉
<22-7,BECKETT>And in a campaign, it would only be worse.

588
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:38,160
<22-7,BECKETT>你  阿丽克西斯  我父亲  玛莎
<22-7,BECKETT>You, Alexis, my dad, Martha,

589
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,770
<22-7,BECKETT>你们都会成为被攻击的对象
<22-7,BECKETT>you guys would all be fair game.

590
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:41,090
<22-8,CASTLE>我们可都是意志坚强的人
<22-8,CASTLE>We're a tough bunch.

591
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,580
<22-9,BECKETT>那你觉得我能竞选吗
<22-9,BECKETT>So you think I could do it?

592
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:45,080
<22-10,CASTLE>我相信你可以
<22-10,CASTLE>I know you can.

593
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:48,960
<22-11,BECKETT>他们说我高分通过了警监考核
<22-11,BECKETT>They said that I aced my captain's exam.

594
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:51,740
<22-11,BECKETT>估计一年之内我就可以管理自己的分局了
<22-11,BECKETT>I could probably have my own precinct within the year.

595
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:55,490
<22-12,CASTLE>什么时候需要答复
<22-12,CASTLE>When do you have to decide?

596
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:56,660
<22-13,BECKETT>很快
<22-13,BECKETT>Soon.

597
00:24:58,370 --> 00:24:59,890
<22-14,CASTLE>不管你如何决定
<22-14,CASTLE>Well, whatever you decide...

598
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:02,100
<22-14,CASTLE>我都支持你
<22-14,CASTLE>I will back your play.

599
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:03,410
<22-15,BECKETT>谢谢
<22-15,BECKETT>Thank you.

601
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:11,830
<22-16,BECKETT>火柴盒的线索有收获了
<22-16,BECKETT>That matchbook lead paid off.

602
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:13,280
<22-17,ESPOSITO>派去监视酒吧的警员
<22-17,ESPOSITO>The unit that we put on that bar

603
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,830
<22-17,ESPOSITO>发现了诺亚·刘易斯
<22-17,ESPOSITO>spotted Noah Lewis heading inside.

604
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:16,010
<22-17,ESPOSITO>刚刚缉捕了他
<22-17,ESPOSITO>E.S.U. just took him down.

605
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,130
<22-18,BECKETT>找到他了
<22-18,BECKETT>They found him.

606
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:22,580
<23-1,NOAH>我妈妈呢
<23-1,NOAH>Where's my mother?

607
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:24,260
<23-2,BECKETT>尸检中
<23-2,BECKETT>Being autopsied.

608
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:25,600
<23-3,NOAH>我警告过她
<23-3,NOAH>I warned her,

609
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:28,220
<23-3,NOAH>但她就是唠叨不停
<23-3,NOAH>but she wouldn't stop running her mouth at me.

610
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,320
<23-3,NOAH>现在唠叨不成了吧
<23-3,NOAH>Now she doesn't say a word.

611
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:33,900
<23-3,NOAH>瞧瞧她的下场
<23-3,NOAH>It's what she deserved.

612
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:35,330
<23-4,CASTLE>那其他人呢
<23-4,CASTLE>Well, what about the others?

613
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:37,060
<23-4,CASTLE>她们也活该吗
<23-4,CASTLE>Did they deserve what they got?

614
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,850
<23-4,CASTLE>我们已经知道你的所作所为了  诺亚
<23-4,CASTLE>We know what you've done, Noah...

615
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:41,850
<23-4,CASTLE>知道了你的真面目
<23-4,CASTLE>Who you really are.

616
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,480
<23-5,BECKETT>讲讲艾玛·马洛伊的事
<23-5,BECKETT>Tell us about Emma Malloy.

617
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,390
<23-6,NOAH>光说名字想不起来
<23-6,NOAH>I'm not good with names.

618
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:53,080
<23-7,CASTLE>你见过她
<23-7,CASTLE>You know her.

619
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:55,250
<23-8,BECKETT>前天晚上你在哪
<23-8,BECKETT>Where were you the night before last?

620
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:56,980
<23-9,NOAH>-外面  -外面哪
<23-9,NOAH>- Out. - Out where?

621
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,500
<23-10,BECKETT>邻居说你的车不在
<23-10,BECKETT>Neighbors said your car was gone.

622
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,220
<23-11,NOAH>开车兜风去了
<23-11,NOAH>I took a drive.

623
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,730
<23-12,BECKETT>是开去森林了吗
<23-12,BECKETT>Did you drive to the woods?

624
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:05,530
<23-12,BECKETT>那这个女孩呢  佐伊·艾迪森
<23-12,BECKETT>What about this girl? Zoey Addison.

625
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,350
<23-13,CASTLE>有人看到她上了你的车  诺亚
<23-13,CASTLE>She was seen getting into your car, Noah.

626
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:09,380
<23-13,CASTLE>现在失踪了
<23-13,CASTLE>Now she's gone.

627
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:11,800
<23-14,NOAH>挺漂亮的
<23-14,NOAH>Mm. She's pretty.

628
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:12,980
<23-15,CASTLE>她死了吗
<23-15,CASTLE>Is she dead?

629
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,030
<23-16,NOAH>我不知道
<23-16,NOAH>I can't help you.

630
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:19,580
<23-17,CASTLE>你把她们都带去哪里了  其他人
<23-17,CASTLE>Where do you take them, the others?

631
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,490
<23-17,CASTLE>你是怎么让她们失踪的
<23-17,CASTLE>How do you make them disappear?

632
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,070
<23-18,BECKETT>我们有你的车  诺亚  还可以调查你的房子
<23-18,BECKETT>We have your car, Noah, your house.

633
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:25,670
<23-18,BECKETT>总会找到证据的
<23-18,BECKETT>We will find evidence.

634
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,350
<23-19,CASTLE>艾玛是不是发现了什么证据
<23-19,CASTLE>Did Emma find evidence?

635
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:28,850
<23-19,CASTLE>所以你才杀了她吗
<23-19,CASTLE>Is that why you went after her?

636
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:30,340
<23-19,CASTLE>因为她接近了真相
<23-19,CASTLE>Because she got too close?

637
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,420
<23-19,CASTLE>所以你才向我们开枪吗
<23-19,CASTLE>Is that why you shot at us?

638
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,480
<23-20,NOAH>你们进了我家
<23-20,NOAH>You were in my house.

639
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,710
<23-20,NOAH>还看不出吗
<23-20,NOAH>Don't you see?

640
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:38,330
<23-20,NOAH>我才是受害者
<23-20,NOAH>I'm the victim here.

641
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:40,180
<23-20,NOAH>我才是受害者
<23-20,NOAH>I'm the victim.

642
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:47,340
<24-1,BECKETT>怎么了
<24-1,BECKETT>What's wrong?

643
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:50,530
<24-2,CASTLE>他逍遥法外了三十多年
<24-2,CASTLE>Just he's been getting away with it for 30 years.

644
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:54,000
<24-2,CASTLE>我本以为他会更...骇人一些
<24-2,CASTLE>I thought he'd be more... formidable.

645
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:55,870
<24-3,RYAN>有麻烦了
<24-3,RYAN>We have a problem.

646
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,620
<24-3,RYAN>刚得到鉴证组的消息
<24-3,RYAN>I just spoke with C.S.U.

647
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:59,780
<24-3,RYAN>目前还未在房中车中发现任何可以证明
<24-3,RYAN>So far, they haven't found anything in the house or the car

648
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:02,060
<24-3,RYAN>诺亚和艾玛或佐伊有关联的证据
<24-3,RYAN>that links Noah to Emma or Zoey.

649
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:04,530
<24-4,CASTLE>就是说我们没法证明他和那些谋杀案的联系
<24-4,CASTLE>So we can't connect him to either of their murders?

650
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,540
<24-5,BECKETT>那他妈妈的死呢
<24-5,BECKETT>What about his mother's?

651
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,330
<24-6,ESPOSITO>尸检结果
<24-6,ESPOSITO>Autopsy results

652
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:08,960
<24-6,ESPOSITO>表明她是自然死亡
<24-6,ESPOSITO>indicate that she died of natural causes.

653
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,350
<24-7,RYAN>现在  他的罪名只有不当处理尸体
<24-7,RYAN>Right now, all we have this guy on is mishandling a body.

654
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:15,240
<24-9,ESPOSITO>-他冲我们开枪了  -是  但当时他在衣橱里
<24-9,ESPOSITO>- He shot at us. - Yeah, but he was hiding in the closet at the time.

655
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,000
<24-10,BECKETT>他可以说不知道我们是警察  可以脱罪的
<24-10,BECKETT>He can claim he didn't know we were cops. He can plead out.

656
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,960
<24-11,RYAN>卡塞尔  我们都没法证明他和霍兰德森林的关系
<24-11,RYAN>Castle, we can't even link this guy to Hollander's Woods.

657
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,850
<24-11,RYAN>83年  他在南卡罗来纳州的
<24-11,RYAN>In '83, he was at a military academy

658
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:23,630
<24-11,RYAN>一所军校上学
<24-11,RYAN>all the way in South Carolina.

659
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,280
<24-12,CASTLE>当时是总统日的周末
<24-12,CASTLE>It was Presidents' day weekend.

660
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,780
<24-12,CASTLE>也许他在休假  或者逃学了
<24-12,CASTLE>He could have been on vacation or -- or just skipping school.

661
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:30,550
<24-13,ESPOSITO>但这些记录没有了  所以没法证明
<24-13,ESPOSITO>Except those records are gone, so there's no way to prove it.

662
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:32,160
<24-13,ESPOSITO>陪审团能看到的只是
<24-13,ESPOSITO>All the jury's gonna hear is that he was

663
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,050
<24-13,ESPOSITO>他当时离新罕布什尔一1000英里
<24-13,ESPOSITO>1,000 miles away from New Hampshire.

664
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:35,670
<24-13,ESPOSITO>没有证据  我们就没法立案
<24-13,ESPOSITO>Without evidence, we don't have a case.

665
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:36,620
<24-14,BECKETT>本案的关键在于艾玛
<24-14,BECKETT>The key to this is Emma.

666
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:37,580
<24-14,BECKETT>我们得证明
<24-14,BECKETT>We need to place his car

667
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:39,150
<24-14,BECKETT>她被袭前后他的车在附近
<24-14,BECKETT>in the area at the time she was attacked.

668
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,610
<24-14,BECKETT>和柯林斯合作  在那里取证
<24-14,BECKETT>Let's coordinate with Collins and set up a canvass up there.

669
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,170
<24-15,CASTLE>总该有个他常去的地方
<24-15,CASTLE>There's got to be a place he goes --

670
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:45,740
<24-15,CASTLE>一个偏僻的用来抛尸的地方
<24-15,CASTLE>somewhere out of the way where he puts the bodies.

671
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,470
<24-16,BECKETT>你说他有个心理医生
<24-16,BECKETT>You said that he was seeing a shrink.

672
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:50,880
<24-17,ESPOSITO>没错  范·霍茨曼医生
<24-17,ESPOSITO>Yeah. A, uh -- a Dr. Van Holtzman.

673
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:53,420
<24-18,BECKETT>也许诺亚的心理咨询中有说过什么
<24-18,BECKETT>You know, maybe Noah said something during his sessions

674
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:54,610
<24-18,BECKETT>有助破案的线索
<24-18,BECKETT>that could help us.

675
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,060
<24-18,BECKETT>去哪找霍茨曼
<24-18,BECKETT>Where do we find Holtzman?

676
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,850
<25-1,CASTLE>如果诺亚被无罪释放
<25-1,CASTLE>If Noah ends up walking,

677
00:27:57,850 --> 00:27:59,440
<25-1,CASTLE>你恐怕得把我弄进精神病院
<25-1,CASTLE>you're gonna have to have me committed.

678
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:01,520
<25-1,CASTLE>打扰
<25-1,CASTLE>Excuse me.

679
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,420
<25-2,BECKETT>我们想见一下霍茨曼医生  谢谢
<25-2,BECKETT>We need to speak with Dr. Holtzman, please.

680
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,790
<25-3,RECEPTIONIST>当然  请稍等
<25-3,RECEPTIONIST>Of course. Just a moment.

681
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:08,940
<25-4,BECKETT>这七年来你的无数疯狂理论
<25-4,BECKETT>Listen, if after seven years of your crazy theories,

682
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,430
<25-4,BECKETT>都没让你走火入魔
<25-4,BECKETT>you haven't already been committed,

683
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:12,030
<25-4,BECKETT>我觉得心理医生还是免了
<25-4,BECKETT>then I think you're pretty safe.

684
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:16,010
<25-4,BECKETT>你好  我是霍茨曼医生
<25-4,BECKETT>Hi. I'm Dr. Holtzman.

685
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:17,360
<25-4,BECKETT>听说你们要找我
<25-4,BECKETT>I understand you've been looking for me.

686
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,410
<25-5,BECKETT>我是贝克特警探
<25-5,BECKETT>Yeah, I'm Detective Beckett.

687
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:19,430
<25-5,BECKETT>这位是理查德·卡塞尔
<25-5,BECKETT>This is Richard Castle.

688
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:20,270
<25-2,BECKETT>我们需要就你的
<25-2,BECKETT>We need to speak with you

689
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:22,950
<25-5,BECKETT>患者诺亚·刘易斯  问你几个问题
<25-5,BECKETT>regarding one of your patients -- Noah Lewis.

690
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,760
<25-5,BECKETT>当然可以
<25-5,BECKETT>Of course.

691
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,280
<25-6,HOLTZMAN>请允许我先处理这几个处方
<25-6,HOLTZMAN>Let me just finish with these prescriptions,

692
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,390
<25-6,HOLTZMAN>然后就来见你们
<25-6,HOLTZMAN>and I'll be right with you.

693
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,360
<25-7,BECKETT>好的
<25-7,BECKETT>Okay.

694
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:31,760
<25-8,CASTLE>贝克特  我认出了他的声音
<25-8,CASTLE>Beckett, I know that voice --

695
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,890
<25-8,CASTLE>就是那天霍兰德森林里那个人的声音
<25-8,CASTLE>from that day in Hollander's Woods.

696
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,170
<25-8,CASTLE>是他  他才是凶手
<25-8,CASTLE>It's him. He's the killer.

697
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,950
<26-1,BECKETT>卡塞尔  那都是三十年前的事了
<26-1,BECKETT>Castle, that was over 30 years ago.

698
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:44,680
<26-2,CASTLE>-你不可能  -凯特  他说话时
<26-2,CASTLE>- You can't possibly -- - Kate, when he spoke,

699
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,090
<26-2,CASTLE>我都能想起刀抵在我喉咙上的感觉
<26-2,CASTLE>I could feel the knife at my throat.

700
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:48,660
<26-2,CASTLE>我死也忘不了那个声音
<26-2,CASTLE>I will never forget that voice as long as I live.

701
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:51,970
<26-3,HOLTZMAN>抱歉耽搁了
<26-3,HOLTZMAN>Sorry about that.

702
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:53,730
<26-3,HOLTZMAN>我们去我办公室谈吧
<26-3,HOLTZMAN>Shall we talk in my office?

703
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:58,920
<27-1,HOLTZMAN>请坐
<27-1,HOLTZMAN>Please, have a seat.

704
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,050
<27-1,HOLTZMAN>我得说听说了诺亚做的事
<27-1,HOLTZMAN>I wish I could say that I was surprised

705
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:05,120
<27-1,HOLTZMAN>我并不惊讶
<27-1,HOLTZMAN>to hear what Noah had done.

706
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:07,270
<27-1,HOLTZMAN>但他确实深受困扰
<27-1,HOLTZMAN>But he was very troubled.

707
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:09,710
<27-1,HOLTZMAN>他在这里接受治疗时我们竭尽了全力
<27-1,HOLTZMAN>We did everything we could for him while he was in our care.

708
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:13,510
<27-2,BECKETT>霍茨曼医生  你治疗刘易斯先生多久了
<27-2,BECKETT>Dr. Holtzman, how long have you been treating Mr. Lewis?

709
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:14,430
<27-2,BECKETT>四年了
<27-2,BECKETT>Four years.

710
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:16,340
<27-3,HOLTZMAN>他母亲送他来后  我们一度稳定了他的病情
<27-3,HOLTZMAN>We got him stable after his mother committed him,

711
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:18,620
<27-3,HOLTZMAN>但放他出院的条件之一就是
<27-3,HOLTZMAN>but a condition of his release

712
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,470
<27-3,HOLTZMAN>每月的法定治疗
<27-3,HOLTZMAN>were state-mandated sessions every month.

713
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:23,100
<27-4,BECKETT>你们俩都聊了些什么
<27-4,BECKETT>And what did the two of you talk about?

714
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:28,300
<27-5,HOLTZMAN>愤怒  亲密  他对女人的敌意
<27-5,HOLTZMAN>Anger, intimacy, his animosity toward women.

715
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:29,780
<27-6,CASTLE>你是达特茅斯毕业的
<27-6,CASTLE>You went to Dartmouth.

716
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,890
<27-7,HOLTZMAN>是的  本科
<27-7,HOLTZMAN>Yes, for undergrad.

717
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:36,250
<27-8,BECKETT>你上一次见到刘易斯先生是什么时候
<27-8,BECKETT>Uh, when was the last time you saw Mr. Lewis?

718
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:37,370
<27-9,HOLTZMAN>几天前
<27-9,HOLTZMAN>A few days ago.

719
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:38,780
<27-9,HOLTZMAN>他相当焦虑
<27-9,HOLTZMAN>He was quite agitated.

720
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:40,450
<27-9,HOLTZMAN>他觉得有人跟踪他
<27-9,HOLTZMAN>He thought someone was following him.

721
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:41,700
<27-9,HOLTZMAN>我以为他只是有妄想症
<27-9,HOLTZMAN>I thought he was just being paranoid,

722
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,340
<27-9,HOLTZMAN>所以调整了他的用药
<27-9,HOLTZMAN>so I adjusted his meds.

723
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:46,600
<27-10,BECKETT>你完全不知道他会有暴力行为
<27-10,BECKETT>And you had no idea that he was about to do something violent?

724
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,060
<27-11,HOLTZMAN>不知道
<27-11,HOLTZMAN>None.

725
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,880
<27-12,CASTLE>他以前也干过这种事
<27-12,CASTLE>He's done this before, you know.

726
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,490
<27-12,CASTLE>绑架女人  在树林里杀了她们
<27-12,CASTLE>Abducted women, killed them in the woods --

727
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,110
<27-12,CASTLE>可能持续了好几年
<27-12,CASTLE>possibly for years.

728
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:56,620
<27-13,HOLTZMAN>你怎么知道的
<27-13,HOLTZMAN>How do you know?

729
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,660
<27-13,HOLTZMAN>有目击者
<27-13,HOLTZMAN>Witnesses.

730
00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:00,920
<27-14,CASTLE>他作案时带着面具
<27-14,CASTLE>When he does it, he wears a mask.

731
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:04,300
<27-14,CASTLE>他为什么这么做  在杀人时带上面具
<27-14,CASTLE>Now, why would he do that -- wear a mask when he kills them?

732
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:06,830
<27-16,CASTLE>-我不知道  -试着猜猜看
<27-16,CASTLE>- I don't know. - If you had to guess.

733
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:10,120
<27-16,CASTLE>什么样的精神疾病会促使一个人这么做
<27-16,CASTLE>What kind of psychosis would drive a man to do that?

734
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:13,050
<27-16,CASTLE>可怕的童年吗
<27-16,CASTLE>Something terrible in his childhood?

735
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:16,510
<27-17,HOLTZMAN>精神变态者的心理可没那么简单
<27-17,HOLTZMAN>The mind of a psychopath is not that simple.

736
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:18,630
<27-18,CASTLE>但他还是杀了她们
<27-18,CASTLE>But he kills them anyway.

737
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:21,750
<27-18,CASTLE>那他为什么要把脸藏在这副面具之下呢
<27-18,CASTLE>So why would he need to hide his face behind this?

738
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:27,690
<27-19,HOLTZMAN>也许他不是在隐藏
<27-19,HOLTZMAN>Maybe he's not hiding it.

739
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,830
<27-19,HOLTZMAN>也许这才是他真正的脸
<27-19,HOLTZMAN>Maybe this is his true face...

740
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,380
<27-19,HOLTZMAN>他内心深处的怪物
<27-19,HOLTZMAN>the monster he knows he really is.

741
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:37,170
<27-19,HOLTZMAN>他希望被害者
<27-19,HOLTZMAN>And he wants his victims

742
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:40,480
<27-19,HOLTZMAN>在临死前看到它  畏惧它
<27-19,HOLTZMAN>to see it and fear it before they die.

743
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:44,190
<27-19,HOLTZMAN>也许他真正的面具
<27-19,HOLTZMAN>Maybe his real mask

744
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:47,070
<27-19,HOLTZMAN>是他每天都伪装成的那个人
<27-19,HOLTZMAN>is the man he has to pretend to be every day.

745
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,250
<28-1,CASTLE>他的声音
<28-1,CASTLE>His voice?

746
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,330
<28-1,CASTLE>我知道  这听上去很疯狂
<28-1,CASTLE>I know. It sounds crazy.

747
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:55,470
<28-2,RYAN>因为它就是很疯狂  卡塞尔
<28-2,RYAN>Because it is, Castle.

748
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:56,660
<28-2,RYAN>我们已经有一个嫌疑犯了
<28-2,RYAN>We already have a suspect.

749
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,190
<28-3,CASTLE>他很有嫌疑
<28-3,CASTLE>Ah, the perfect suspect.

750
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,310
<28-3,CASTLE>因为霍茨曼医生了解他病人的
<28-3,CASTLE>Because Dr. Holtzman knew intimate details

751
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:02,890
<28-3,CASTLE>隐私  他陷害诺亚为他顶罪
<28-3,CASTLE>about his patients, he set Noah up to take the fall

752
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:05,090
<28-3,CASTLE>以防有人查到那些谋杀案
<28-3,CASTLE>just in case anyone got onto the murders.

753
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,660
<28-3,CASTLE>而且霍茨曼1983年时在新罕布什尔州
<28-3,CASTLE>And Holtzman was in New Hampshire, at Dartmouth,

754
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:08,850
<28-3,CASTLE>达特茅斯学院
<28-3,CASTLE>in 1983.

755
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:11,380
<28-4,ESPOSITO>他是个居家好男人  结婚24年
<28-4,ESPOSITO>He's a family man, married to his wife for 24 years.

756
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:13,730
<28-4,ESPOSITO>有孩子  非常受人尊敬  从未被逮捕过
<28-4,ESPOSITO>Kids, well-respected, never been arrested.

757
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:14,820
<28-5,RYAN>还有目击者
<28-5,RYAN>And witnesses.

758
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,590
<28-5,RYAN>他们看见被害人上了诺亚的车
<28-5,RYAN>They saw the victim get into Noah's car,

759
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:17,860
<28-5,RYAN>而不是霍茨曼的
<28-5,RYAN>not Holtzman's.

760
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,200
<28-6,CASTLE>那件事我还无法解释  但是
<28-6,CASTLE>I can't explain that yet, but...

761
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:23,370
<28-6,CASTLE>霍茨曼是幕后黑手
<28-6,CASTLE>Holtzman is behind this, and...

762
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:29,250
<28-7,BECKETT>宝贝  那个声音  有没有可能是你记错了
<28-7,BECKETT>Babe, the voice -- is it possible you're misremembering?

763
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:31,660
<28-7,BECKETT>你把这个杀手魔鬼化了
<28-7,BECKETT>You've made this killer your personal bogeyman.

764
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:32,590
<28-7,BECKETT>你自己也说过
<28-7,BECKETT>You said so yourself.

765
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,790
<28-7,BECKETT>你希望他更骇人一些
<28-7,BECKETT>You wanted him to be more formidable.

766
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:36,060
<28-8,CASTLE>你们不相信我
<28-8,CASTLE>You don't believe me.

767
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:37,870
<28-9,BECKETT>他是清白的
<28-9,BECKETT>He's clean.

768
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:39,420
<28-9,BECKETT>他和这桩案件没有关系
<28-9,BECKETT>He has no connection to this case.

769
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:40,860
<28-9,BECKETT>我们没有线索继续追查
<28-9,BECKETT>We've got nothing to go on.

770
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:42,000
<28-10,ESPOSITO>比没有还要少
<28-10,ESPOSITO>Less than nothing.

771
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,700
<28-10,ESPOSITO>我们只有一个30年前的声音指认
<28-10,ESPOSITO>All we have is a 30-year-old voice I.D.

772
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:46,010
<28-10,ESPOSITO>况且目击者在案发时还是个孩子
<28-10,ESPOSITO>from a witness who was a kid at the time.

773
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:49,060
<28-11,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我们和你一样想破案
<28-11,BECKETT>Look, Castle, we want to solve it as much as you do.

774
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,030
<28-12,CASTLE>你知道吗
<28-12,CASTLE>You know what?

775
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:53,230
<28-12,CASTLE>我料到这些人会不相信我
<28-12,CASTLE>I expected this from these guys.

776
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:55,690
<28-12,CASTLE>但我没料到你也如此
<28-12,CASTLE>Just not from you.

777
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,050
<28-13,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<28-13,BECKETT>Castle.

778
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:24,550
<28-13,BECKETT>对不起
<28-13,BECKETT>I'm sorry.

779
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:27,980
<29-1,BECKETT>你说是他  我相信你
<29-1,BECKETT>You said it was him. I believe you.

780
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,280
<29-2,CASTLE>但你说得对
<29-2,CASTLE>Except you're right.

781
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,510
<29-2,CASTLE>我们什么也做不了
<29-2,CASTLE>There's nothing we can do.

782
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:34,280
<29-2,CASTLE>我们得盯梢他好几年  等他再次出手
<29-2,CASTLE>We'd have to sit on him for years, hoping he makes a move.

783
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:37,920
<29-2,CASTLE>这不是故事应有的结局
<29-2,CASTLE>This is not how the story was supposed to end.

784
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,570
<29-3,BECKETT>我在想
<29-3,BECKETT>I was thinking.

785
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:43,520
<29-3,BECKETT>他是如何让被害者无声无息地消失的呢
<29-3,BECKETT>How did he make those victims disappear without a trace?

786
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:45,790
<29-4,CASTLE>他一定得把她们带到某个地方
<29-4,CASTLE>Well, he would have had to have taken them somewhere.

787
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:47,580
<29-5,BECKETT>某个他的家人不知道的地方
<29-5,BECKETT>Somewhere his family didn't know about.

788
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:51,370
<29-6,CASTLE>他一定有个老巢  一个贮藏室
<29-6,CASTLE>He'd have to have a lair, a storage space somewhere.

789
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,630
<29-7,BECKETT>那就有太多危险了
<29-7,BECKETT>Too many things could go wrong.

790
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:54,890
<29-7,BECKETT>比如洪水  再比如爱管闲事的管理人员
<29-7,BECKETT>There could be a flood, a nosy manager.

791
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:56,480
<29-7,BECKETT>他必须找一个
<29-7,BECKETT>He would have to find a place

792
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,740
<29-7,BECKETT>他可以完全掌控的地方
<29-7,BECKETT>over which he had absolute control.

793
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:01,120
<29-7,BECKETT>所以我做了个资产调查
<29-7,BECKETT>So I did a property search.

794
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:05,260
<29-7,BECKETT>他名下什么也没有  但我找到了这个
<29-7,BECKETT>It came up empty on him, but I did find this.

795
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:08,720
<29-8,CASTLE>-农场  -是啊
<29-8,CASTLE>- Farmland? - Yeah.

796
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,370
<29-9,BECKETT>产权归霍茨曼去世的父母所有
<29-9,BECKETT>Owned by Holtzman's parents, both deceased.

797
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:12,230
<29-9,BECKETT>在一份信托中
<29-9,BECKETT>It's in a trust.

798
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:14,670
<29-9,BECKETT>霍茨曼被列为唯一的受托人
<29-9,BECKETT>Holtzman is listed as the sole trustee.

799
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:16,800
<29-9,BECKETT>他的妻子有可能不知道
<29-9,BECKETT>It's possible his wife doesn't know about it.

800
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:19,350
<29-10,CASTLE>这距离艾玛被卡车撞倒的地方只有几英里
<29-10,CASTLE>It's only a few miles from where Emma was hit by that truck.

801
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:22,070
<29-11,BECKETT>税收记录显示这个地产上有座谷仓
<29-11,BECKETT>Tax records show that there's a barn on the property.

802
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,890
<29-12,CASTLE>他一定把她关在那儿了
<29-12,CASTLE>He must have held her there.

803
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:26,800
<29-12,CASTLE>那是私人地产  又荒无人烟
<29-12,CASTLE>It's private, in the middle of nowhere.

804
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,270
<29-12,CASTLE>最佳隐蔽场所
<29-12,CASTLE>The perfect lonely place.

805
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:30,850
<29-13,BECKETT>只是  我永远也拿不到搜索令
<29-13,BECKETT>Only, I would never get a warrant.

806
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:32,220
<29-13,BECKETT>如果没有搜索令去搜查的话
<29-13,BECKETT>And if I searched it without one,

807
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:35,040
<29-13,BECKETT>我找到的任何证据都不会被许可
<29-13,BECKETT>then any evidence I would find would be inadmissible.

808
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,070
<29-14,CASTLE>因为你是个警察
<29-14,CASTLE>'cause you're a cop.

809
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:38,420
<29-14,CASTLE>但你不是
<29-14,CASTLE>But you're not.

810
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:41,020
<29-15,BECKETT>这是非法入侵
<29-15,BECKETT>It would be trespassing.

811
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:43,270
<29-15,BECKETT>你会违法的
<29-15,BECKETT>You would be breaking the law.

812
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,340
<29-15,BECKETT>但如果你找到了线索
<29-15,BECKETT>But if you found something...

813
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,050
<29-15,BECKETT>我知道这对你来说意义重大
<29-15,BECKETT>And I know how much this means to you,

814
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:51,710
<29-15,BECKETT>所以不管你的决定如何  我都支持你
<29-15,BECKETT>so whatever you decide, I will back your play.

815
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,350
<30-1,BECKETT>看上去荒废很久了
<30-1,BECKETT>Looks deserted.

816
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:07,170
<30-2,CASTLE>这是地产分割线
<30-2,CASTLE>This is the property line.

817
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:08,660
<30-2,CASTLE>你应该待在这边
<30-2,CASTLE>You should stay back here on this side.

818
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:10,540
<30-3,BECKETT>好吧  但你不能单独进去
<30-3,BECKETT>Okay, but you're not going in alone.

819
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,400
<30-3,BECKETT>打开免提
<30-3,BECKETT>Keep me on speaker.

820
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,460
<30-3,BECKETT>告诉我你找到了什么
<30-3,BECKETT>Let me know what you find.

821
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:13,230
<30-4,CASTLE>好
<30-4,CASTLE>Right.

822
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,170
<31-1,BECKETT>你看见什么了
<31-1,BECKETT>So, what are you seeing?

823
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,800
<31-2,CASTLE>他好像将谷仓用作贮藏
<31-2,CASTLE>Looks like he uses it for storage.

824
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:39,080
<31-2,CASTLE>恐怖  恐怖的贮藏
<31-2,CASTLE>Creepy, creepy storage.

825
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,680
<31-3,CASTLE>贝克特  这有一辆和诺亚一样的车
<31-3,CASTLE>Beckett, it's the same car that Noah has.

826
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:48,610
<31-3,CASTLE>同样的颜色
<31-3,CASTLE>Same color...

827
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,580
<31-3,CASTLE>同样的车牌  同样的标志  一模一样
<31-3,CASTLE>Same license plate, same sticker -- everything.

828
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:52,400
<31-3,CASTLE>他就是这么干的
<31-3,CASTLE>That's how he did it.

829
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,960
<31-4,BECKETT>如果有人看到他  就会追查到诺亚
<31-4,BECKETT>So if someone spotted him, it would lead right back to Noah.

830
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,670
<31-4,BECKETT>但你需要更多线索才能报警
<31-4,BECKETT>But you're gonna need more than that to call the police.

831
00:34:57,910 --> 00:34:58,900
<31-4,BECKETT>四处看看
<31-4,BECKETT>Look around.

832
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:01,110
<31-4,BECKETT>他可能保留了被害人的物件当做战利品
<31-4,BECKETT>He may have kept trophies from his victims.

833
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:09,890
<31-5,BECKETT>你还好吗
<31-5,BECKETT>You okay?

834
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:15,770
<31-6,CASTLE>是的
<31-6,CASTLE>Yeah.

835
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:29,750
<31-7,CASTLE>上帝啊
<31-7,CASTLE>Oh, god.

836
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,140
<31-7,CASTLE>卡塞尔
<31-7,CASTLE>Castle?

837
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:33,260
<31-8,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你看到了什么
<31-8,BECKETT>Castle, what do you see now?

838
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:36,520
<31-9,CASTLE>我看到了她们
<31-9,CASTLE>I see them.

839
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:39,520
<31-9,CASTLE>被害者的照片
<31-9,CASTLE>Photos of his victims.

840
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:41,320
<31-9,CASTLE>都在这
<31-9,CASTLE>I see all of them.

841
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:53,840
<31-10,CASTLE>贝克特  他在这  他在屋里
<31-10,CASTLE>Beckett, he's here. He's inside.

842
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:55,170
<31-11,HOLTZMAN>你怎么找到我的
<31-11,HOLTZMAN>How did you find me?

843
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,560
<31-12,CASTLE>自霍兰德森林的事之后  我一直在找你
<31-12,CASTLE>I've been looking for you since Hollander's Woods.

844
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:02,600
<31-13,HOLTZMAN>那男孩
<31-13,HOLTZMAN>The boy.

845
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:04,630
<31-13,HOLTZMAN>是你
<31-13,HOLTZMAN>That was you?

846
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:08,030
<31-13,HOLTZMAN>当时我应该杀了你
<31-13,HOLTZMAN>I should have killed you when I had the chance.

847
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:09,690
<31-14,CASTLE>你赢不了的  霍茨曼
<31-14,CASTLE>You can't win, Holtzman.

848
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:11,410
<31-14,CASTLE>我们知道你是谁
<31-14,CASTLE>We know who you are.

849
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:12,870
<31-15,HOLTZMAN>无所谓
<31-15,HOLTZMAN>It doesn't matter.

850
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,160
<31-15,HOLTZMAN>你俩都会死
<31-15,HOLTZMAN>You're both be dead.

851
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,440
<31-15,HOLTZMAN>他们永远找不到我
<31-15,HOLTZMAN>And they'll never find me.

852
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:18,770
<31-15,HOLTZMAN>卡塞尔
<31-15,HOLTZMAN>Castle!

853
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,390
<32-1,BECKETT>被锁住了
<32-1,BECKETT>It's locked!

00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:32,750
<33-2,BECKETT>我进不去
<33-2,BECKETT>I can't get in!

856
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,070
<33-3,HOLTZMAN>面对心魔的危险是
<33-3,HOLTZMAN>The danger of facing your demons...

857
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,680
<33-3,HOLTZMAN>...有时  心魔会战胜你
<33-3,HOLTZMAN>...is that sometimes the demons win.

858
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:44,900
<34-1,BECKETT>卡塞尔  发生了什么
<34-1,BECKETT>Castle, what's going on in there?!

863
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,900
<34-1,BECKETT>著名心理学家范·霍茨曼乡下住所
<34-1,BECKETT>Still more gruesome discoveries and many more questions

864
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:43,400
<34-1,BECKETT>发现了更多可怖物证  留下更多不解谜题
<34-1,BECKETT>at the rural property of noted psychologist Van Holtzman

865
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,990
<34-1,BECKETT>当局仍在寻找
<34-1,BECKETT>as authorities continue

866
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:47,570
<38-1,NEWSCASTER>被其埋藏的被害者尸体
<38-1,NEWSCASTER>to find the buried bodies of his victims.

867
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:57,030
<38-2,BECKETT>我以为你要练习今晚的演讲
<38-2,BECKETT>Thought you were practicing your speech for tonight.

868
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:58,300
<38-3,CASTLE>是的
<38-3,CASTLE>Oh, yeah. I was.

869
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,400
<38-3,CASTLE>只是...
<38-3,CASTLE>I just, um...

870
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:02,590
<38-3,CASTLE>我不禁在想
<38-3,CASTLE>I couldn't help but wonder --

871
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:06,870
<38-3,CASTLE>如果不是他  不是那天树林里发生的事
<38-3,CASTLE>If it wasn't for him, for that day in the woods,

872
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:09,010
<38-3,CASTLE>我会成为现在的我吗
<38-3,CASTLE>would I even be here?

873
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:10,490
<38-3,CASTLE>我们会相遇吗
<38-3,CASTLE>Would we be here?

874
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:15,180
<38-4,BECKETT>宝贝  我们相识相知不是因为他
<38-4,BECKETT>Babe, we're not here because of him.

875
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:20,580
<38-4,BECKETT>我们拥有彼此是因为面对他这样的人  成就了我们
<38-4,BECKETT>We're here because of who we are in the face of people like him.

876
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,720
<38-4,BECKETT>所以你成为悬疑小说家
<38-4,BECKETT>That's why you write mysteries.

877
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,750
<38-4,BECKETT>所以我成为警察
<38-4,BECKETT>That's why I became a cop.

878
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,380
<38-4,BECKETT>我们都试图伸张正义
<38-4,BECKETT>We're both trying to bring justice to this world.

879
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:35,990
<38-4,BECKETT>现在
<38-4,BECKETT>Now...

880
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:41,930
<38-4,BECKETT>我去换衣服
<38-4,BECKETT>...I'm gonna go and get dressed

881
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:46,610
<38-4,BECKETT>以便到时我可以好好地为真实的你而骄傲
<38-4,BECKETT>so I can be very proud tonight of who you are.

<39-1,MICHAEL CONNELLY>Murder, mystery, the macabre --

892
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:28,950
<39-2,CASTLE>我...
<39-2,CASTLE>You know, I-I...

893
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:31,580
<39-2,CASTLE>过去这几天  我一直在想
<39-2,CASTLE>I've spent a lot of time the last few days

894
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:33,620
<39-2,CASTLE>我是如何走到这一步的
<39-2,CASTLE>thinking about how I got here.

895
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:39,280
<39-2,CASTLE>无尽的赶稿  停不住的灵感枯竭
<39-2,CASTLE>The long hours, the blank pages.

896
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:44,520
<39-2,CASTLE>很多人认为写作是份孤独的职业
<39-2,CASTLE>Most people think that writing is a solitary profession,

897
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:48,620
<39-2,CASTLE>我们窝在屋里  沉浸在想象世界
<39-2,CASTLE>that we spend our days in our imaginary worlds...

898
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:52,140
<39-2,CASTLE>打斗  恋爱  死去
<39-2,CASTLE>fighting, loving, dying.

899
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:54,560
<39-2,CASTLE>但我们不是孤军奋战
<39-2,CASTLE>But we don't do it alone...

900
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:59,780
<39-2,CASTLE>因为我们所写的佳作来源于真实
<39-2,CASTLE>Because anything that's good in our writing comes from truth.

901
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:01,080
<39-2,CASTLE>事实是
<39-2,CASTLE>And the truth is,

902
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:05,980
<39-2,CASTLE>我走到这一步是因为我生命中的贵人
<39-2,CASTLE>I'm here because of the people in my life.

903
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:07,810
<39-2,CASTLE>母亲
<39-2,CASTLE>Mother.

904
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:10,990
<39-2,CASTLE>在我眼中  你永远是明星
<39-2,CASTLE>You will always be a star in my eyes.

905
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:15,510
<39-2,CASTLE>阿丽克西斯  你每天都让我赞叹
<39-2,CASTLE>And, Alexis, you amaze me every day.

906
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:21,040
<39-2,CASTLE>你俩是我无条件之爱的两根红发支柱
<39-2,CASTLE>You two are my redheaded pillars of unconditional love.

907
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:25,140
<39-2,CASTLE>12分局的朋友们
<39-2,CASTLE>To my friends at the 12th precinct...

908
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:27,520
<39-2,CASTLE>你们容纳了我
<39-2,CASTLE>You let me in.

909
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:32,150
<39-2,CASTLE>尤其是哈维尔和凯文
<39-2,CASTLE>Especially you two, Javier, Kevin.

910
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,640
<39-2,CASTLE>你们把我当成并肩作战的兄弟
<39-2,CASTLE>You've made me your brother-in-arms,

911
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,660
<39-2,CASTLE>为此  感谢你们
<39-2,CASTLE>and I thank you for that.

912
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:41,260
<39-2,CASTLE>凯特
<39-2,CASTLE>And Kate.

913
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,810
<39-2,CASTLE>七年前  我以为我再也写不下去了
<39-2,CASTLE>Seven years ago, I thought I would never write again.

914
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,710
<39-2,CASTLE>结果你走进了大门
<39-2,CASTLE>And then you walked through the door.

915
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,350
<39-2,CASTLE>我的世界就此改变
<39-2,CASTLE>And my whole world changed.

916
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:55,300
<39-2,CASTLE>你是对的  你曾说"我什么都不知道"
<39-2,CASTLE>You were right -- you said I had no idea.

917
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:58,350
<39-2,CASTLE>但我现在知道了
<39-2,CASTLE>But now I do.

918
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,090
<39-2,CASTLE>这是因为你
<39-2,CASTLE>This is because of you.

919
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,600
<38-4,BECKETT>因为我们
<38-4,BECKETT>Because of us.

920
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,030
<38-4,BECKETT>永远
<38-4,BECKETT>Always.

921
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:27,060
<40-1,MARTHA>演讲很感人  亲爱的
