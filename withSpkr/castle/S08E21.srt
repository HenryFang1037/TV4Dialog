00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,050
<1-3,ALEXIS>断电  拜托
<1-3,ALEXIS>Blackout. Come on.

19
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,440
<1-3,ALEXIS>肯定是风暴引起的
<1-3,ALEXIS>Must be from the storm.

20
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,800
<2-1,HAYLEY>等等  我知道我父亲在这儿
<2-1,HAYLEY>Hold on. I know my dad keeps

21
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,330
<2-2,ALEXIS>放了个手电筒
<2-2,ALEXIS>a flashlight here somewhere.

22
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:53,600
<2-2,ALEXIS>你听到了吗
<2-2,ALEXIS>Did you hear that?

23
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,030
<2-2,ALEXIS>有人企图闯进来吗
<2-2,ALEXIS>Is someone trying to break in?

24
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:05,920
<2-2,ALEXIS>终结即将到来
<2-2,ALEXIS>Finis omnium nunc est.

25
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:22,860
<2-2,ALEXIS>断电  电话不能用
<2-2,ALEXIS>So, the power is out, the phones are down.

26
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,030
<2-2,ALEXIS>知道这意味着什么吗
<2-2,ALEXIS>You know what that means?

27
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,740
<2-2,ALEXIS>不会有深夜工作电话
<2-2,ALEXIS>No late-night calls from work

28
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,740
<4-1,RICHARD CASTLE>打断我们的裸体扭扭乐游戏
<4-1,RICHARD CASTLE>to interrupt our game of naked Twister.

<4-1,RICHARD CASTLE>等等  你怎么还穿着衣服
<4-1,RICHARD CASTLE>What, why are you still dressed?

<4-2,KATE BECKETT>我得去趟分局
<4-2,KATE BECKETT>I've got to go to the precinct.

31
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:31,450
<4-3,CASTLE>什么  现在吗
<4-3,CASTLE>What? Now?!

32
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:34,260
<4-3,CASTLE>没有什么比断电更浪漫了
<4-3,CASTLE>T-There's nothing more romantic than a blackout.

33
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,670
<4-4,BECKETT>是啊  也没有比这更致命的了
<4-4,BECKETT>Yeah, and nothing more deadly.

34
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,870
<4-4,BECKETT>你跟我一样清楚  一发生断电
<4-4,BECKETT>You know as well as I do that as soon as the lights go out,

35
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:39,410
<4-4,BECKETT>就会发生坏事
<4-4,BECKETT>bad things happen.

36
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,040
<4-5,BECKETT>那是什么
<4-5,BECKETT>What the hell's that?

37
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:43,910
<4-6,CASTLE>侦探社办公室的紧急信号
<4-6,CASTLE>The panic signal from the P.I. Office.

38
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:46,420
<4-6,CASTLE>阿丽克西斯独自在那边时我就会打开
<4-6,CASTLE>I had it set up for when Alexis is there by herself.

39
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,460
<4-7,CASTLE>没有信号
<4-7,CASTLE>No service.

40
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,510
<4-8,BECKETT>贝克特警监呼叫中心
<4-8,BECKETT>This is Captain Beckett to Central.

41
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:53,010
<5-1,CASTLE>阿丽克西斯
<5-1,CASTLE>Alexis?

42
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,440
<5-1,CASTLE>怎么回事  你没事吧
<5-1,CASTLE>What happened? Are you all right?

43
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,930
<5-2,ALEXIS>嗯  那人拿着斧子闯了进来
<5-2,ALEXIS>Yeah. That guy broke in with an ax,

44
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:57,970
<5-2,ALEXIS>吼了一句拉丁文
<5-2,ALEXIS>yelling something in Latin.

45
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:00,070
<5-2,ALEXIS>然后倒地死掉了
<5-2,ALEXIS>Then he just dropped dead.

46
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:01,410
<5-3,CASTLE>他说了什么
<5-3,CASTLE>What did he say?

47
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,420
<5-4,ALEXIS>不知道  发生得太快了
<5-4,ALEXIS>I don't know. It all happened so fast.

48
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,820
<5-5,BECKETT>他是拿那个闯进来的吗
<5-5,BECKETT>Is that what he broke in with?

49
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,290
<5-6,HAYLEY>是啊  这才叫硬闯派对呢
<5-6,HAYLEY>Yep. Talk about crashing a party.

50
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:09,360
<5-6,HAYLEY>原来是楼下大堂的消防斧
<5-6,HAYLEY>Turns out it's the fire ax from the downstairs lobby.

51
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,860
<5-7,BECKETT>那么闯入者肯定是上来的路上拿的
<5-7,BECKETT>So our intruder must've grabbed it on his way up.

52
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:13,990
<5-7,BECKETT>为什么啊  想闯进这间办公室
<5-7,BECKETT>But why? I mean, there's easier ways

53
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:15,560
<5-7,BECKETT>明明有更简单的办法
<5-7,BECKETT>to break into this office.

54
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,640
<5-8,HAYLEY>是啊  而且更安静
<5-8,HAYLEY>Yeah, and more silent.

55
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,760
<5-8,HAYLEY>他绝对是没打算让人不备
<5-8,HAYLEY>He certainly wasn't planning on sneaking up on anyone.

56
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:19,870
<5-9,BECKETT>你查到他身份了吗
<5-9,BECKETT>You get an ID on the guy?

57
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:22,340
<5-10,HAYLEY>没有  没有钱包
<5-10,HAYLEY>No. No wallet, and your, uh,

58
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,290
<5-10,HAYLEY>而且你的便携指纹机器不好使了
<5-10,HAYLEY>portable fingerprint thingumajiggy is down

59
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:25,040
<5-10,HAYLEY>天气的原因
<5-10,HAYLEY>due to weather.

60
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,180
<5-11,LANIE PARISH>他左侧受伤  导致流血致死
<5-11,LANIE PARISH>He bled to death from a wound in his left side.

61
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,470
<5-11,LANIE PARISH>我猜  不管是什么刺伤了他
<5-11,LANIE PARISH>My guess is whatever he was stabbed with

62
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,390
<5-11,LANIE PARISH>刺穿了他的锁骨下动脉
<5-11,LANIE PARISH>punctured his subclavian artery.

63
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:33,810
<5-11,LANIE PARISH>之后  他大概坚持了30分钟
<5-11,LANIE PARISH>After that, he would've had about 30 minutes

64
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,140
<5-11,LANIE PARISH>最多一小时
<5-11,LANIE PARISH>to an hour, tops.

65
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:38,810
<5-12,HAYLEY>他晚上九点拿着这东西进来
<5-12,HAYLEY>Well, he came in here with this around 9:00 p.m.

66
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:40,390
<5-12,HAYLEY>之后很快就倒地了
<5-12,HAYLEY>He keeled over shortly thereafter.

67
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:43,660
<5-13,BECKETT>那么他肯定是8点到8:30间受伤的
<5-13,BECKETT>So he must've been stabbed between 8:00 and 8:30.

68
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:46,560
<5-13,BECKETT>他戴了一条医院腕带
<5-13,BECKETT>There's a -- There's a hospital bracelet.

69
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:49,590
<5-13,BECKETT>闯入者名叫G·肖
<5-13,BECKETT>Our intruder's name is G. Shaw,

70
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,440
<5-13,BECKETT>他是
<5-13,BECKETT>and he was a patient at...

71
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:55,550
<5-13,BECKETT>皮科莫精神病院的病人
<5-13,BECKETT>Peakmore Psychiatric Facility.

72
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,710
<5-14,CASTLE>哎呦
<5-14,CASTLE>Yikes.

73
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:57,900
<5-15,HAYLEY>你认识那里吗
<5-15,HAYLEY>You know it?

74
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,820
<5-16,CASTLE>那是一家罪犯精神病院
<5-16,CASTLE>It's a psychiatric hospital for the criminally insane.

75
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:05,590
<5-16,CASTLE>这位挥斧疯子是个落跑精神病人
<5-16,CASTLE>Our ax-wielding psycho is an escaped mental patient.

76
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,260
<6-1,KEVIN RYAN>备用发电机不太好使
<6-1,KEVIN RYAN>Back-up generator's not working so well.

77
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,370
<6-2,JAVIER ESPOSITO>是啊  按说这样的地方该很先进才对
<6-2,JAVIER ESPOSITO>Yeah, place like this you'd think would be state of the art.

78
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:14,010
<6-3,CASTLE>我们是为一名逃跑犯人而来
<6-3,CASTLE>We're here about an escaped inmate

79
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:15,700
<6-3,CASTLE>他刚刚企图用斧子杀两个人
<6-3,CASTLE>just tried to kill two people with an ax.

80
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,020
<6-4,SECURITY GUARD>稍等
<6-4,SECURITY GUARD>Wait here.

81
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:24,580
<6-5,ESPOSITO>如果我住这里  肯定也会想跑
<6-5,ESPOSITO>Yo, I'd try to escape, too, if I lived here.

82
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,430
<6-5,ESPOSITO>谁知道他们都对病人做什么呢
<6-5,ESPOSITO>Who knows what they're doing to them back there.

83
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:29,010
<6-6,CASTLE>不可能比历史上发生过的事更糟了
<6-6,CASTLE>Can't be anything worse than what we did historically.

84
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:32,240
<6-6,CASTLE>很多文化都误将精神疾病当做妖术的征兆
<6-6,CASTLE>Many cultures mistook mental illness for a sign of sorcery.

85
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,640
<6-6,CASTLE>治疗从祈祷
<6-6,CASTLE>Treatments ranged from, well, prayer

86
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,850
<6-6,CASTLE>到颅骨钻孔释放恶魔都有
<6-6,CASTLE>to drilling holes in the skull to release the demons.

87
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:37,920
<6-7,RYAN>绝对是治疗比
<6-7,RYAN>Definitely a case of the cure

88
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,150
<6-7,RYAN>疾病更糟的一个案例

92
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:46,500
<6-10,CASTLE>你们找到加百列·肖了吗
<6-10,CASTLE>Did you find Gabriel Shaw?

93
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,820
<6-10,CASTLE>不  是他找到了我们
<6-10,CASTLE>No, he found us,

94
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,040
<6-10,CASTLE>但此前他被捅伤  伤势致命
<6-10,CASTLE>but not before he was fatally stabbed.

95
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,740
<6-11,MARTIN>太可怕了
<6-11,MARTIN>That's terrible.

96
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:55,110
<6-11,MARTIN>加百列·肖在皮科莫待了20年了
<6-11,MARTIN>Gabriel Shaw's been here at Peakmore for the last 20 years.

97
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:55,990
<6-12,CASTLE>他做了什么
<6-12,CASTLE>What did he do?

98
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:58,330
<6-13,MARTIN>他闯进了一个沃伦·克朗的家
<6-13,MARTIN>He broke into the house of a man named Warren Crowne,

99
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:00,600
<6-13,MARTIN>企图杀他和他全家
<6-13,MARTIN>tried to kill him and his entire family.

100
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,150
<6-14,CASTLE>那个大慈善家沃伦·克朗吗
<6-14,CASTLE>Warren Crowne the philanthropist?

101
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,360
<6-14,CASTLE>我记得当时的新闻标题
<6-14,CASTLE>I remember the headlines.

102
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,020
<6-14,CASTLE>他的袭击者不是自称复仇天使吗
<6-14,CASTLE>Didn't his attacker say he was some kind of avenging angel?

103
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,960
<6-15,RYAN>大天使加百列  圣徒信使
<6-15,RYAN>The archangel Gabriel -- the divine messenger.

104
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,160
<6-15,RYAN>教义问答学得好
<6-15,RYAN>Catechism class.

105
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,930
<6-15,RYAN>加百列·肖深信
<6-15,RYAN>Gabriel Shaw was convinced

106
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:13,230
<6-16,MARTIN>他在执行上帝的任务
<6-16,MARTIN>that he was on a mission from God

107
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:14,570
<6-16,MARTIN>要铲除世界的邪恶
<6-16,MARTIN>to rid the world of evil.

108
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:18,090
<6-16,MARTIN>即便经历了20年的抗精神病药和
<6-16,MARTIN>It was a mission that even 20 years of antipsychotic drugs

109
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:20,720
<6-16,MARTIN>电击疗法都无法让他放弃这个任务
<6-16,MARTIN>and electroshock therapy could not dissuade him from.

110
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,670
<6-17,ESPOSITO>知道谁可能会想他死吗
<6-17,ESPOSITO>Any idea who might've wanted him dead?

111
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:23,620
<6-18,MARTIN>没有
<6-18,MARTIN>None.

112
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:26,840
<6-18,MARTIN>加百列几乎与外面世界毫无联系
<6-18,MARTIN>Gabriel's contact with the outside world was virtually nil.

113
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:28,380
<6-18,MARTIN>他的房间就在这边
<6-18,MARTIN>His room's down here.

114
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,530
<6-19,RYAN>知道他是怎么逃的吗
<6-19,RYAN>Any idea how he might've escaped?

115
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:35,310
<6-20,MARTIN>知道  他偷了一位护工的钥匙卡
<6-20,MARTIN>Yes, he, uh, he stole a keycard from one of our orderlies.

116
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:38,700
<6-20,MARTIN>我们今天大概中午时候就发现他失踪了
<6-20,MARTIN>Uh, we realized he was missing around noon today.

00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:42,030
<6-21,RYAN>中午  你们之前为什么没报警
<6-21,RYAN>Noon? Why the hell didn't you call the police before?

118
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:43,880
<6-22,MARTIN>我现在意识到我们是该报警
<6-22,MARTIN>We should have. I realize that now.

119

<6-23,CASTLE>他挥着斧子冲进了我的办公室
<6-23,CASTLE>The man came to my office wielding an ax.

120
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,010
<6-24,MARTIN>所以我派出了
<6-24,MARTIN>Which is why I sent out

121
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,350
<6-24,MARTIN>一组护工找加百列
<6-24,MARTIN>a group of orderlies looking for Gabriel.

122
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:52,920
<6-24,MARTIN>他们找了一整天  空手而归
<6-24,MARTIN>They searched all day and came back empty-handed.

123
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:55,210
<6-25,RYAN>-只是  -只是什么
<6-25,RYAN>- Except - Except what?

124

<6-26,MARTIN>有一位护工还没回来呢
<6-26,MARTIN>One of the orderlies hasn't come back yet.

<6-26,MARTIN>戴维·霍比
<6-26,MARTIN>Uh, Dave Holmby.

<6-26,MARTIN>I-I-I tried calling him, but the phones are out.

127
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:05,430
<6-27,RYAN>戴维和加百列之前有什么过节吗
<6-27,RYAN>Have Dave and Gabriel had any problems in the past?

128
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:09,180
<6-28,MARTIN>他们是有些矛盾
<6-28,MARTIN>They've had... issues, yes.

129
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:13,180
<6-28,MARTIN>事实上  加百列偷的就是戴维的钥匙卡
<6-28,MARTIN>In fact, it was Dave's keycard that Gabriel stole.

130
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,970
<6-28,MARTIN>但戴维在我们这儿干很久了
<6-28,MARTIN>But Dave's been with us a long time.

131
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:18,060
<6-28,MARTIN>他不是会杀人的人
<6-28,MARTIN>He's not the type of person to kill anyone,

132
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,190
<6-28,MARTIN>如果你们在这么想的话
<6-28,MARTIN>if that's what you're thinking.

133
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:22,180
<6-29,ESPOSITO>你们派护工去抓一个暴力
<6-29,ESPOSITO>You sent an orderly out to recapture a violent,

134
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,490
<6-29,ESPOSITO>精神不稳定的人
<6-29,ESPOSITO>mentally unstable man.

135
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,720
<6-29,ESPOSITO>他或许是想制服加百列
<6-29,ESPOSITO>It's possible he was trying to subdue Gabriel

136
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,260
<6-29,ESPOSITO>结果事态失控了
<6-29,ESPOSITO>and things got out of control.

137
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,650
<6-30,RYAN>于是戴维捅伤了加百列
<6-30,RYAN>So, Dave stabs Gabriel,

138
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:30,330
<6-30,RYAN>但又在暴风雨中与他失散
<6-30,RYAN>but then loses him in the storm.

139
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,990
<6-31,CASTLE>各位  你们听到了吗
<6-31,CASTLE>Guys, are you hearing that?

140
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,700
<6-32,CASTLE>那里面有什么东西
<6-32,CASTLE>Something in here.

141
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,440
<6-33,CASTLE>怎么不说你们有鼠患
<6-33,CASTLE>Might've told me about your rodent problem.

142
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,150
<6-34,MARTIN>我们没有
<6-34,MARTIN>We don't have one.

143
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,480
<6-34,MARTIN>一般没有
<6-34,MARTIN>Not usually.

144
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,860
<6-36,RYAN>肯定是因为暴风雨跑上来了
<6-36,RYAN>Must've been driven to higher ground by the storm.

145
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,000
<6-36,RYAN>那是本《圣经》吗
<6-36,RYAN>That a bible?

146
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,500
<6-37,CASTLE>是啊  但上面有画
<6-37,CASTLE>Yeah, but with... drawings...

147
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,160
<6-37,CASTLE>画的是恶魔  通篇都是
<6-37,CASTLE>of demons, page after page of them.

148
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,860
<6-38,LANIE>莱恩  哈维  有人吗
<6-38,LANIE>Ryan, Javi, anyone there?

149
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,710
<6-39,RYAN>收到  蕾妮  讲
<6-39,RYAN>Yeah, Lanie. We're here. Go ahead.

150
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:21,240
<6-40,LANIE>赶紧来停尸房
<6-40,LANIE>Well, get your ass to the morgue.

151
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,930
<6-40,LANIE>我发现了令人不安的东西
<6-40,LANIE>I found something disturbing.

152
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:25,470
<6-41,CASTLE>是啊  不安的事还挺多呢
<6-41,CASTLE>Yeah, well, that seems to be going around.

153
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,890
<7-1,CASTLE>是什么...
<7-1,CASTLE>So, what is so --

154
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,430
<7-1,CASTLE>那是血吗
<7-1,CASTLE>Is that blood?

155
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,300
<7-2,BECKETT>据蕾妮说不是的
<7-2,BECKETT>Well, not according to Lanie.

156
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:42,600
<7-3,RYAN>那是什么
<7-3,RYAN>Then...what is it?

157
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,910
<7-4,BECKETT>是墨水
<7-4,BECKETT>Some kind of ink.

158
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:46,660
<7-4,BECKETT>蕾妮把样本送去实验室了
<7-4,BECKETT>Lanie sent samples to the lab,

159
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,760
<7-4,BECKETT>但我们知道  从纹样看来
<7-4,BECKETT>but one thing that we do know is, based on the writing,

160
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,610
<7-4,BECKETT>加百列不可能是自己弄上去的
<7-4,BECKETT>there's no way that Gabriel did this to himself.

161
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,200
<7-5,ESPOSITO>那么是医院的什么人
<7-5,ESPOSITO>So, then, someone at the hospital.

162
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:53,800
<7-6,BECKETT>是啊  我打了电话  他们说
<7-6,BECKETT>Yeah, I called, and they said

163
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,170
<7-6,BECKETT>他今早逃出去时
<7-6,BECKETT>that he didn't have any writing on him

164
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:56,490
<7-6,BECKETT>身上还没有图案
<7-6,BECKETT>when he escaped this morning.

165
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:58,390
<7-7,CASTLE>罗马数字是《圣经》章节
<7-7,CASTLE>The Roman numerals are bible verses,

166
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:00,000
<7-7,CASTLE>文字都是拉丁语的
<7-7,CASTLE>and the words are all in Latin.

167
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:04,440
<7-7,CASTLE>"保护我  主  不受邪恶之手侵害"
<7-7,CASTLE>"Protect me, O Lord, from the hands of the wicked."

168
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:06,590
<7-8,RYAN>是救赎祷文
<7-8,RYAN>It's a prayer for salvation.

169
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:08,720
<7-9,ESPOSITO>听起来他在害怕  怕什么呢
<7-9,ESPOSITO>Sounds like he was scared, but of what?

170
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,780
<7-10,LANIE>还不止这些谜团
<7-10,LANIE>The mysteries don't stop there.

171
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:13,510
<7-10,LANIE>我进行尸检的时候  我发现伤口
<7-10,LANIE>When I conducted the autopsy, I found that the wound

172
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:17,160
<7-10,LANIE>是什么爪子弄出来的
<7-10,LANIE>had been inflicted by some kind of talon or claw.

173
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,460
<7-11,RYAN>动物那样吗
<7-11,RYAN>Like an animal?

174
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:19,730
<7-12,LANIE>还有更怪的
<7-12,LANIE>It gets even weirder.

175
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:22,600
<7-12,LANIE>伤口内有种奇怪的物质
<7-12,LANIE>There was a strange substance inside the wound.

176
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,960
<7-13,CASTLE>我猜猜  硫磺
<7-13,CASTLE>Let me guess -- sulfur.

177
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,100
<7-14,LANIE>你怎么知道
<7-14,LANIE>Yeah, how'd you know?

178
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:29,800
<7-15,CASTLE>各位  这还不明显吗
<7-15,CASTLE>Guys, isn't it obvious?

179
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,550
<7-15,CASTLE>拉丁祷文  爪子  硫磺  也就是
<7-15,CASTLE>Latin prayers, a claw, sulfur -- also known...

180
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:35,780
<7-15,CASTLE>硫磺石
<7-15,CASTLE>as brimstone?

181
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,210
<7-16,ESPOSITO>拜托  卡塞尔
<7-16,ESPOSITO>Come on, Castle.

182
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,030
<7-17,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你不是认为
<7-17,BECKETT>Castle, you don't think that --

183
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:39,610
<7-18,CASTLE>我就是
<7-18,CASTLE>Oh, but I do.

184
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,820
<7-18,CASTLE>我们都有心魔
<7-18,CASTLE>We all have our demons.

185
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,330
<7-18,CASTLE>但加百列的恶魔杀了他
<7-18,CASTLE>But Gabriel was killed by his.

195
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,270
<8-1,BECKETT>我怎么说的
<8-1,BECKETT>What did I tell you?

196
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:57,220
<8-1,BECKETT>一断电  就会发生坏事
<8-1,BECKETT>I mean, as soon as the lights go out, bad things happen.

197
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:59,750
<8-1,BECKETT>至少分局在用备用发电机
<8-1,BECKETT>You know, at least the precinct is on a backup generator,

198
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:00,800
<8-1,BECKETT>全城其他地方
<8-1,BECKETT>'cause the rest of the city

199
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,330
<8-1,BECKETT>都要间歇用电
<8-1,BECKETT>is gonna have intermittent power.

200
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,650
<8-1,BECKETT>今天会像地狱般难熬
<8-1,BECKETT>Today's gonna be hell.

201
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,680
<8-1,BECKETT>这话合适
<8-1,BECKETT>Well, that's appropriate,

202
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,170
<8-2,CASTLE>因为凶手很可能就来自那里
<8-2,CASTLE>since that's the likely place our killer is from.

203
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:09,760
<8-2,CASTLE>你说我们会不会需要特别武器
<8-2,CASTLE>You know, do you think we're gonna need specialized equipment

204
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,670
<8-2,CASTLE>来抓这个恶魔杀人犯  比如有驱魔性能的
<8-2,CASTLE>to capture this demon murderer, something exorcism-esque?

205
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,300
<8-3,BECKETT>这案子没什么超自然可言
<8-3,BECKETT>There's nothing supernatural about this case.

206
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,060
<8-4,CASTLE>被害人被沾有硫磺的爪子捅伤了
<8-4,CASTLE>Our victim was stabbed with a brimstone-covered claw,

207
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,860
<8-4,CASTLE>也或许是被角戳了
<8-4,CASTLE>or gored by a horn, perhaps.

208
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,400
<8-4,CASTLE>除了恶魔还有什么能做到啊
<8-4,CASTLE>Now, what but a demon could do that?

209
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,500
<8-5,BECKETT>莱恩和埃斯波
<8-5,BECKETT>Look, Ryan and Espo are

210
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,690
<8-5,BECKETT>这就要把玩失踪的护工戴维·霍比带来
<8-5,BECKETT>bringing in Dave Holmby, our rogue orderly,

211
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:26,350
<8-5,BECKETT>他们肯定能问出
<8-5,BECKETT>and I am sure that they are going to get

212
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:28,930
<8-5,BECKETT>非常正常  有理有据的
<8-5,BECKETT>a very sane and grounded explanation

213
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:30,780
<8-5,BECKETT>他杀加百列·肖的理由
<8-5,BECKETT>as to why he killed Gabriel Shaw.

214
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,720
<8-6,CASTLE>寻求真相  你究竟得到启蒙
<8-6,CASTLE>Seek the truth - and thou shalt be enlightened.

215
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:34,920
<8-7,BECKETT>是《圣经》里的吗
<8-7,BECKETT>Is that scripture?

216
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,010
<8-8,CASTLE>是卡塞尔福音里的
<8-8,CASTLE>From the book of Castle.

217
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:40,070
<9-1,ESPOSITO>我去  那场暴风雨真是厉害
<9-1,ESPOSITO>Hot damn, that was some storm!

218
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:42,790
<9-2,RYAN>可不是  简直不让人活
<9-2,RYAN>Seriously, fit for neither man nor beast.

219
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:45,390
<9-2,RYAN>真是难以想象
<9-2,RYAN>I can only imagine how hard it was

220
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:47,770
<9-2,RYAN>在这样的天气里追踪一个精神病人有多困难
<9-2,RYAN>to track down an escaped mental patient in the middle of it.

221
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:49,660
<9-3,ESPOSITO>是啊  真是赶上福尔摩斯的
<9-3,ESPOSITO>Yeah, that was some Sherlock-level

222
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,100
<9-3,ESPOSITO>侦探水平了  戴维
<9-3,ESPOSITO>detective work, Dave.

223
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,710
<9-3,ESPOSITO>纽约警局如果能招到你这样的人就太幸运了
<9-3,ESPOSITO>NYPD would be lucky to have someone like you.

224
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:54,600
<9-5,ESPOSITO>知道我们该干什么吗
<9-5,ESPOSITO>You know what we should do?

225
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:57,640
<9-7,ESPOSITO>-给他张申请表  -好主意
<9-7,ESPOSITO>- Give him an application. - Ooh, that's a good idea.

226
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,790
<9-9,RYAN>但有杀人的问题
<9-9,RYAN>Ahh, there's that whole murder issue.

227
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:02,830
<9-10,ESPOSITO>是啊
<9-10,ESPOSITO>Right.

228
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:05,330
<9-11,RYAN>如果你昨晚逮到肖之后
<9-11,RYAN>If only you wouldn't have killed Shaw last night

229
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,220
<9-12,ESPOSITO>没杀了他多好
<9-12,ESPOSITO>after you caught him.

230
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:08,820
<9-12,ESPOSITO>我倒不是不理解你  他偷了你的钥匙卡嘛
<9-12,ESPOSITO>Not that I don't sympathize. I mean, he stole your keycard.

231
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,470
<9-14,ESPOSITO>-是啊  -你大概要被解雇了
<9-14,ESPOSITO>- Yep. - You probably were gonna get fired.

232
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,610
<9-15,DAVE HOLMBY>等等  我跟肖分开时  他还有气呢
<9-15,DAVE HOLMBY>Wait a minute. When I left Shaw, he was still alive.

233
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:15,570
<9-16,RYAN>那么你承认他跑了之后还见过他了
<9-16,RYAN>Oh, so you admit to seeing him after he escaped?

234
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:16,990
<9-16,RYAN>是的
<9-16,RYAN>Yeah.

235
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:20,070
<9-17,DAVE>他以前老提87街上的一家教堂
<9-17,DAVE>Look, he used to talk about this church on 87th street.

236
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:22,420
<9-17,DAVE>所以我去了那儿  他正往外走
<9-17,DAVE>So I went up there. There he was, walking out.

237
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,790
<9-17,DAVE>我抓住了他  想把他拖上我的车  但
<9-17,DAVE>I grabbed him, I tried to drag him into my car, but...

238
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:25,820
<9-18,RYAN>怎么了
<9-18,RYAN>But what?

239
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,740
<9-19,DAVE>他知道我
<9-19,DAVE>He knew that I was...

240
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,530
<9-19,DAVE>偷病人的药
<9-19,DAVE>liberating meds from patients

241
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:32,210
<9-19,DAVE>然后上街头转卖
<9-19,DAVE>and selling them on the street.

242
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:33,640
<9-19,DAVE>我猜猜
<9-19,DAVE>Let me guess.

243
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,250
<9-20,ESPOSITO>他说如果你带他回去
<9-20,ESPOSITO>He told you that if you took him back,

244
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,750
<9-20,ESPOSITO>他就出卖你
<9-20,ESPOSITO>he was gonna rat you out.

245
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,540
<9-21,DAVE>他是那么说还好了
<9-21,DAVE>I wish he said that.

246
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,690
<9-21,DAVE>他说无论如何都会把事说出去
<9-21,DAVE>He promised he was gonna out me no matter what.

247
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:42,630
<9-22,RYAN>等等  听上去
<9-22,RYAN>Wait a minute, that sounds like

248
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:44,020
<9-22,RYAN>你更有捅他的动机了
<9-22,RYAN>even more of a motive to stab the guy.

249
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,790
<9-23,DAVE>我发誓  我放他走了
<9-23,DAVE>I swear, I let him go.

250
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:47,590
<9-23,DAVE>他昨天4:30时还活着
<9-23,DAVE>He was alive at 4:30 yesterday,

251
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:49,190
<9-23,DAVE>那是我最后一次见到他
<9-23,DAVE>and that was the last time that I saw him.

252
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,510
<9-24,RYAN>你为什么没回皮科莫
<9-24,RYAN>So, why didn't you go back to Peakmore?

253
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:52,360
<9-24,RYAN>你为什么躲在你女友公寓里
<9-24,RYAN>Why were you hiding out at your girlfriend's apartment?

254
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,360
<9-24,RYAN>我没躲
<9-24,RYAN>I wasn't hiding.

255
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,400
<9-25,DAVE>我以为肖迟早要被抓到
<9-25,DAVE>I figured Shaw was gonna get caught sooner or later,

256
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,980
<9-25,DAVE>那么我无论如何也会丢了工作
<9-25,DAVE>which meant that I was out of a job no matter what.

257
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:58,980
<9-25,DAVE>所以我心想  算了
<9-25,DAVE>So I said screw it.

258
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,750
<9-25,DAVE>不如干脆给自己放假吧
<9-25,DAVE>Might as well take the rest of the night off and,

259
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:02,990
<9-25,DAVE>陪陪我女朋友
<9-25,DAVE>you know, spend some time with my girl.

260
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,800
<9-26,ESPOSITO>就算这是真的
<9-26,ESPOSITO>All right, let's pretend that that's true.

261
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:07,650
<9-26,ESPOSITO>为什么现在  他都被关了20年了
<9-26,ESPOSITO>Why now? After 20 years of confinement,

262
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,580
<9-26,ESPOSITO>肖为什么突然决定越狱
<9-26,ESPOSITO>why would Shaw decide to break out?

263
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,520
<9-27,DAVE>我只知道  这几周来
<9-27,DAVE>All I know is in the past few weeks,

264
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,660
<9-27,DAVE>他一直很激动
<9-27,DAVE>he was really amped up.

265
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,900
<9-28,RYAN>为什么  他出什么事了吗
<9-28,RYAN>Why? Something happen to him?

266
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,740
<9-29,DAVE>不是什么事  是什么人  有个探视者
<9-29,DAVE>Not something, someone -- a visitor.

267
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,710
<9-30,ESPOSITO>谁
<9-30,ESPOSITO>Who?

268
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:18,380
<9-30,ESPOSITO>我不知道
<9-30,ESPOSITO>I don't know.

269
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:21,110
<9-31,DAVE>但不管那人是谁  都让肖很激动
<9-31,DAVE>But whoever it was really set Shaw off.

270
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,920
<9-31,DAVE>他原本就很不稳定
<9-31,DAVE>I mean, he was already disturbed,

271
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,000
<9-31,DAVE>但那人来过之后  他情况更糟了
<9-31,DAVE>but after this guy came by, he got even worse.

272
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:30,340
<10-1,ALEXIS>我调出了肖20年前的
<10-1,ALEXIS>So, I pulled the police file and court records

273
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,900
<10-1,ALEXIS>警方案卷和法庭记录
<10-1,ALEXIS>for Shaw's prosecution 20 years ago,

274
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,320
<10-1,ALEXIS>据这里写  肖对克朗家的袭击
<10-1,ALEXIS>and according to this, Shaw's attack on the Crowne family

275
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,650
<10-1,ALEXIS>绝不是临时起意
<10-1,ALEXIS>was anything but random.

276
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:36,950
<10-1,ALEXIS>他当时是一名
<10-1,ALEXIS>He was working as a consultant

277
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:38,540
<10-1,ALEXIS>私家侦探诺亚·克雷默的顾问
<10-1,ALEXIS>for a P.I. named Noah Kramer.

278
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,080
<10-2,HAYLEY>什么样的顾问
<10-2,HAYLEY>What kind of consultant?

279
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,320
<10-3,ALEXIS>精神顾问
<10-3,ALEXIS>Spiritual.

280
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,850
<10-3,ALEXIS>克雷默受雇调查克朗一家
<10-3,ALEXIS>Kramer had been hired to investigate the Crowne family.

281
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:46,630
<10-4,HAYLEY>等等  一个私家侦探为什么要雇精神顾问
<10-4,HAYLEY>Wait. Why would a P.I. hire a spiritual consultant

282
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:49,110
<10-4,HAYLEY>协助调查一个亿万富翁慈善家
<10-4,HAYLEY>to help investigate a billionaire philanthropist?

283
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,240
<10-5,HAYLEY>怎么了
<10-5,HAYLEY>What? What is it?

284
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,310
<10-6,ALEXIS>我知道肖为什么来这间办公室了
<10-6,ALEXIS>I know why Shaw came to this office.

285
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,920
<10-6,ALEXIS>20年前  这里是诺亚·克雷默的办公室
<10-6,ALEXIS>20 years ago, this was Noah Kramer's office.

286
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:59,340
<11-1,CASTLE>更新案件板了  那么一定是
<11-1,CASTLE>Ooh, updating the murder board must mean

287
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,500
<11-2,RYAN>-霍比的不在场证明证实了  -是啊
<11-2,RYAN>- Holmby's alibi checked out? - That it did.

288
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,840
<11-4,RYAN>-太棒了  -不是吧
<11-4,RYAN>- Yes! - Really?

289
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,580
<11-5,CASTLE>拜托  我就是很高兴结束了护工理论
<11-5,CASTLE>Come on. I'm just excited to get off the whole orderly thing

290
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:07,970
<11-5,CASTLE>踏上了寻找真正凶手的路程
<11-5,CASTLE>and on to the trail of the true killer,

291
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:09,730
<11-5,CASTLE>很可能是条通往地狱的路
<11-5,CASTLE>which is most likely a road paved to hell,

292
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:10,790
<11-5,CASTLE>因为我们都知道
<11-5,CASTLE>because we all know

293
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:12,140
<11-5,CASTLE>恶魔都是那里来的
<11-5,CASTLE>that's where demons come from.

294
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:14,230
<11-6,RYAN>我一定会把肖的探视者
<11-6,RYAN>Well, I will be sure to cross reference

295
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:16,980
<11-6,RYAN>跟坠落天使名单做对比的  好吗
<11-6,RYAN>Shaw's visitor against the list of fallen angels, okay?

296
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,360
<11-7,CASTLE>埃斯波西托拿到探视名单了吗
<11-7,CASTLE>Has Esposito gotten the visitor logs yet?

297
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,930
<11-8,RYAN>他在办  但由于断电
<11-8,RYAN>Well, he's trying, but the power outage

298
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,220
<11-8,RYAN>什么事都很慢
<11-8,RYAN>is slowing everything down.

299
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,710
<11-8,RYAN>有什么问题吗
<11-8,RYAN>Something wrong?

300
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,560
<11-9,CASTLE>看啊
<11-9,CASTLE>Look at that.

301
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,740
<11-10,RYAN>似乎是镜头光晕  怎么了
<11-10,RYAN>Yeah, it looks just like a lens flair. Why?

302
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:32,670
<11-11,CASTLE>-又出现了  -好奇怪
<11-11,CASTLE>- There it is again. - Weird.

303
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,920
<11-12,RYAN>那不是
<11-12,RYAN>That's not...

304
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,620
<11-13,CASTLE>爸爸  海莉和我做了调查  20年前
<11-13,CASTLE>Dad, Hayley and I did some digging, and 20 years ago,

305
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,020
<11-14,ALEXIS>加百列·肖是一名私家侦探
<11-14,ALEXIS>Gabriel Shaw worked as a consultant

306
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:50,560
<11-14,ALEXIS>诺亚·克雷默的顾问  他就在你的办公室工作
<11-14,ALEXIS>for a P.I. named Noah Kramer who worked out of your office.

307
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,120
<11-15,CASTLE>或许肖拿着斧子过去
<11-15,CASTLE>It's possible that Shaw came there with the ax

308
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:53,970
<11-15,CASTLE>是去找克雷默了
<11-15,CASTLE>looking for Kramer.

309
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:55,820
<11-16,HAYLEY>这个理论不错  但克雷默早死了
<11-16,HAYLEY>Well, it's a nice theory, but Kramer's long dead.

310
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:56,850
<11-16,HAYLEY>肖被送入皮科莫
<11-16,HAYLEY>He was killed in an accident

311
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,990
<11-16,HAYLEY>一年半后他死于事故
<11-16,HAYLEY>a year and a half after Shaw was committed to Peakmore.

312
00:11:58,990 --> 00:11:59,980
<11-17,CASTLE>什么样的事故
<11-17,CASTLE>What kind of an accident?

313
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:02,700
<11-18,ALEXIS>他被从一建筑工地坠落的管子刺穿了
<11-18,ALEXIS>He was impaled by a pipe that fell at a construction site.

314
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,990
<11-19,CASTLE>好吧  好可怕
<11-19,CASTLE>Okay. That's horrible.

315
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:07,320
<11-19,CASTLE>但是  肖还是有可能因为头脑不清楚
<11-19,CASTLE>But still, it's possible that Shaw was delusional enough

316
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,880
<11-19,CASTLE>而以为克雷默还活着
<11-19,CASTLE>to believe that Kramer was still alive.

317
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,590
<11-20,HAYLEY>或许吧  克雷默的妻子孩子
<11-20,HAYLEY>Maybe. You know, Kramer's wife and kid

318
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:11,550
<11-20,HAYLEY>还住在城里
<11-20,HAYLEY>still live in the city.

319
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:14,400
<11-20,HAYLEY>或许他们知道肖的动机
<11-20,HAYLEY>Perhaps they can shed some light on Shaw's motives.

320
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,870
<11-21,CASTLE>告诉我他们的地址
<11-21,CASTLE>Give me an address for them.

321
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,220
<11-21,CASTLE>写下来
<11-21,CASTLE>Write this down.

322
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,840
<11-21,CASTLE>等等  我去拿支笔
<11-21,CASTLE>Hang on, let me get a pen.

323
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:21,650
<12-1,SONDRA KRAMER>加百列·肖死了
<12-1,SONDRA KRAMER>Gabriel Shaw is dead?

324
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,380
<12-3,SONDRA>我们昨天才见到他
<12-3,SONDRA>We just saw him yesterday.

325
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,460
<12-4,CASTLE>在哪
<12-4,CASTLE>Where?

326
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,440
<12-5,SONDRA>他来了我们家
<12-5,SONDRA>Well, he came by the house.

327
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:29,620
<12-5,SONDRA>他说皮科莫释放了他
<12-5,SONDRA>He said he was released from Peakmore.

328
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,560
<12-6,RYAN>他有什么事
<12-6,RYAN>What did he want?

329
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,820
<12-7,MARSHALL KRAMER>他想找20年前留给我父亲的东西
<12-7,MARSHALL KRAMER>He was looking for stuff he left with my dad 20 years ago.

330
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:34,750
<12-8,CASTLE>什么样的东西
<12-8,CASTLE>What kind of stuff?

331
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,550
<12-9,MARSHALL>我不知道  我没问  我们
<12-9,MARSHALL>I don't know. I didn't ask. We --

332
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:40,150
<12-9,MARSHALL>我们不想跟他扯上关系
<12-9,MARSHALL>We didn't want anything to do with him.

333
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:41,480
<12-9,MARSHALL>他毁了我爸的生活
<12-9,MARSHALL>He ruined my dad's life.

334
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:43,690
<12-10,SONDRA>马歇尔当时还太小  不记得
<12-10,SONDRA>Marshall's too young to remember,

335
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:46,400
<12-10,SONDRA>但他知道
<12-10,SONDRA>but he's well aware

336
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,700
<12-10,SONDRA>加百列·肖是如何毁了我们家
<12-10,SONDRA>of how Gabriel Shaw ruined our family.

337
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,880
<12-10,SONDRA>肖袭击了克朗一家后
<12-10,SONDRA>After Shaw attacked the Crownes,

338
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,630
<12-10,SONDRA>我丈夫的名誉尽毁
<12-10,SONDRA>my husband's reputation was destroyed.

339
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:58,170
<12-10,SONDRA>诺亚很震惊他结交的朋友
<12-10,SONDRA>Noah was shocked to think that a man he befriended

340
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:02,120
<12-10,SONDRA>居然暗藏如此邪恶
<12-10,SONDRA>could've hidden such...evil.

341
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:04,710
<12-10,SONDRA>诺亚觉得他们的合作
<12-10,SONDRA>Noah thought the work they had done together

342
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:07,540
<12-10,SONDRA>是个错误  需要掩埋起来
<12-10,SONDRA>was a mistake and thought it needed to be buried.

343
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,980
<12-11,RYAN>你们有肖的东西吗
<12-11,RYAN>So, do you have anything of Shaw's?

344
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:11,210
<12-12,SONDRA>没有  我丈夫死后
<12-12,SONDRA>Oh, no. No, after my husband died,

345
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:12,990
<12-12,SONDRA>我实在不忍进入他的办公室
<12-12,SONDRA>I just couldn't bear going into his office,

346
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:16,050
<12-12,SONDRA>于是我雇了家公司把家具都卖掉了
<12-12,SONDRA>so I-I hired a company to sell off the furniture

347
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:17,220
<12-12,SONDRA>然后把其他东西都丢掉了
<12-12,SONDRA>and just dump the rest.

348
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,980
<12-12,SONDRA>肖走之前我都告诉他了
<12-12,SONDRA>I told Shaw all of this before he left.

349
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:20,980
<12-13,RYAN>那是几点
<12-13,RYAN>What time was that?

350
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,410
<12-14,MARSHALL>大概5点
<12-14,MARSHALL>Around 5:00.

351
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:25,490
<12-15,CASTLE>据他碰到凶手还差3.5小时
<12-15,CASTLE>That's still 3.5 hours before he met his murderer.

352
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:27,980
<12-16,RYAN>他有提到他接下来要去哪吗
<12-16,RYAN>Did he mention anything about where he was going next?

353
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:31,620
<12-17,SONDRA>没有  但他走之前说了句拉丁语
<12-17,SONDRA>No, but he said something in Latin before he walked away.

354
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,180
<12-18,CASTLE>你还记得是什么吗  或许很重要
<12-18,CASTLE>Do you remember what that was? It could be very important.

355
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,580
<12-19,SONDRA>终结...我不知道
<12-19,SONDRA>Finis omnium... I don't know.

356
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,990
<12-20,MARSHALL>即将到来
<12-20,MARSHALL>Nunc est.

357
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:44,010
<12-21,CASTLE>终结即将到来
<12-21,CASTLE>Finis omnium nunc est.

358
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,480
<12-22,RYAN>终结即将到来
<12-22,RYAN>The end is upon us.

359
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,530
<13-1,CASTLE>我知道肖昨晚为什么挥着斧子闯进来了
<13-1,CASTLE>I know why Shaw came here wielding an ax last night.

360
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:51,690
<13-2,HAYLEY>罪孽地杀死
<13-2,HAYLEY>To commit unholy murder

361
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:53,490
<13-2,HAYLEY>两名出众得不可思议的女性吗
<13-2,HAYLEY>on two unbelievably exceptional women?

362
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:55,160
<13-3,CASTLE>接近  但不对
<13-3,CASTLE>Close, but no.

363
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,160
<13-3,CASTLE>他是想进入那里
<13-3,CASTLE>He was trying to get in there.

364
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,750
<13-4,HAYLEY>保险箱吗
<13-4,HAYLEY>The safe?

365
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,930
<13-5,CASTLE>我租下办公室时  这里都被糊上了
<13-5,CASTLE>This was all drywalled over when I rented the office.

366
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,190
<13-5,CASTLE>我翻修时  承包商才发现了它
<13-5,CASTLE>The contractors found it when I was doing the renovations.

367
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:05,610
<13-5,CASTLE>房东以为已经拆掉了
<13-5,CASTLE>The landlord thought it had been removed,

368
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:09,010
<13-5,CASTLE>显然诺亚·克雷默死前筑墙把它封上了
<13-5,CASTLE>but clearly Noah Kramer walled it up before he died,

369
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:11,100
<13-5,CASTLE>意图埋葬他和肖在一同调查的东西
<13-5,CASTLE>intent on burying whatever he and Shaw were working on.

370
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,720
<13-6,ALEXIS>所以肖才拿了把斧子
<13-6,ALEXIS>That's why Shaw grabbed the ax --

371
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:14,290
<13-6,ALEXIS>是想打开保险箱
<13-6,ALEXIS>to try and break into the safe.

372
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:16,570
<13-7,HAYLEY>-里面有什么  -我不知道
<13-7,HAYLEY>- So, what's inside? - I don't know.

373
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,720
<13-8,CASTLE>等等  你从未打开过
<13-8,CASTLE>Wait a minute. You've never opened --

374
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,880
<13-9,HAYLEY>为什么不啊
<13-9,HAYLEY>Why the hell not?

375
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:21,030
<13-10,CASTLE>薛定谔的猫
<13-10,CASTLE>Schrodinger's cat.

376
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,840
<13-11,HAYLEY>天呐  这又是他的
<13-11,HAYLEY>Oh, God. Is this another one of his --

377
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,500
<13-12,ALEXIS>这可好
<13-12,ALEXIS>Great!

378
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,980
<13-13,HAYLEY>不不  听我说
<13-13,HAYLEY>No, no. It's -- look.

379
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,310
<13-14,CASTLE>如果我打开了它  我就注定要失望
<13-14,CASTLE>If I opened it, I was bound to be disappointed

380
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:28,630
<13-14,CASTLE>不管里面是有什么
<13-14,CASTLE>with whatever was inside.

381
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:29,660
<13-14,CASTLE>如果我不打开它
<13-14,CASTLE>If I never opened it,

382
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,400
<13-14,CASTLE>那么我想象的任何东西都可能在里面
<13-14,CASTLE>literally anything I imagine could be in there.

383
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,240
<13-15,HAYLEY>所以你选择了幻想而非现实吗
<13-15,HAYLEY>So, you chose fantasy over reality?

384
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:34,970
<13-16,CASTLE>当然
<13-16,CASTLE>Well, duh.

385
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:36,360
<13-17,ALEXIS>但我们现在要打开它了  是吧
<13-17,ALEXIS>But we're going to open it now, right?

386
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,270
<13-16,CASTLE>当然了
<13-16,CASTLE>Well, duh.

387
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:38,970
<13-18,CASTLE>如果有个被恶魔杀死的
<13-18,CASTLE>When an ax-wielding psychopath

388
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:41,720
<13-18,CASTLE>挥斧疯子想打开它  显然
<13-18,CASTLE>is killed by a demon trying to get inside, clearly,

389
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,640
<13-18,CASTLE>里面的东西绝对值得一看
<13-18,CASTLE>whatever's in there is worth seeing.

390
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,770
<13-18,CASTLE>如果
<13-18,CASTLE>If only...

391
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,530
<13-18,CASTLE>我认识会开保险箱的人就好了
<13-18,CASTLE>I knew someone who could crack a safe?

392
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:51,440
<13-19,HAYLEY>是杰斐逊钛500保险箱
<13-19,HAYLEY>It's a Jefferson Titanium 500 vault.

393
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,420
<13-20,CASTLE>什么意思
<13-20,CASTLE>Meaning?

394
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:56,820
<13-21,HAYLEY>我需要28分钟和一杯巧克力奶昔
<13-21,HAYLEY>I need 28 minutes and a chocolate milkshake.

395
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,750
<13-22,CASTLE>你开玩笑吧
<13-22,CASTLE>You're kidding.

396
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,380
<13-23,HAYLEY>-巧克力奶昔  -没问题
<13-23,HAYLEY>- Chocolate milkshake. - Chocolate milkshake.

397
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:00,570
<13-23,HAYLEY>这就去
<13-23,HAYLEY>Chocolate milkshake.

398
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,600
<14-1,ESPOSITO>-警监  -怎么
<14-1,ESPOSITO>- Captain. - Yeah?

399
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,490
<14-3,ESPOSITO>据皮科莫的探视记录
<14-3,ESPOSITO>According to Peakmore's visitor's logs,

400
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:06,110
<14-3,ESPOSITO>去探视肖的人叫丹尼斯·沃姆沃德
<14-3,ESPOSITO>the person who came to see Shaw was named Dennis Wormwood.

401
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:07,330
<14-4,BECKETT>很好  找到他了吗
<14-4,BECKETT>Oh, good. Any luck finding him?

402
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:08,570
<14-5,ESPOSITO>没有  这是个假名
<14-5,ESPOSITO>No, because it's a fake name.

403
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:10,480
<14-6,BECKETT>好吧  皮科莫肯定有监控
<14-6,BECKETT>Okay, well, Peakmore must have security videos,

404
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,710
<14-6,BECKETT>调出监控  看能否确认他身份
<14-6,BECKETT>so pull the feed, see if you can ID him.

405
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:12,680
<14-7,ESPOSITO>我调了
<14-7,ESPOSITO>I did.

406
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,900
<14-7,ESPOSITO>看看
<14-7,ESPOSITO>Check this out.

407
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:18,090
<14-8,BECKETT>好奇怪
<14-8,BECKETT>Oh, that's strange.

408
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:19,950
<14-9,ESPOSITO>该说恐怖
<14-9,ESPOSITO>Creepy is more like it.

409
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:21,180
<14-9,ESPOSITO>你觉得卡塞尔会不会是对的
<14-9,ESPOSITO>So, do you think Castle's right --

410
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:24,040
<14-10,BECKETT>不不不  不许你火上浇油
<14-10,BECKETT>No, no, no, no. Don't even add fuel to that fire.

411
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,050
<14-10,BECKETT>那个报了假名的人  肯定为了保密那次探视
<14-10,BECKETT>Whoever gave the fake name must've sabotaged the videos

412
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:28,270
<14-10,BECKETT>而破坏了监控录像
<14-10,BECKETT>in order to keep that visit a secret,

413
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:30,040
<14-10,BECKETT>因此他更可能是凶手了
<14-10,BECKETT>which makes him look even more like our killer.

414
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,340
<14-11,ESPOSITO>好吧  我会继续查的
<14-11,ESPOSITO>All right, I'll keep digging.

415
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,830
<15-1,CASTLE>这是不是...太吵了  我去...
<15-1,CASTLE>Is this -- this is -- this is loud. I'm gonna...

416
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:55,650
<15-1,CASTLE>好了
<15-1,CASTLE>Got it.

417
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:58,590
<15-2,HAYLEY>好了  这是你最后
<15-2,HAYLEY>Okay, it's your last chance

418
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:02,420
<15-2,HAYLEY>发挥想象的机会了
<15-2,HAYLEY>to let your imagination run wild.

419
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:05,300
<15-4,ALEXIS>-我不用再想了  -或许我们不该打开
<15-4,ALEXIS>- I'm good. - Eh, maybe we shouldn't.

420
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:08,380
<15-4,ALEXIS>考虑到魔鬼落跑精神病人什么的
<15-4,ALEXIS>Given the whole Satanic, escaped-mental-patient angle?

421
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,800
<15-5,CASTLE>阿丽克西斯  我们不能让恐惧控制我们的行为
<15-5,CASTLE>Alexis, we can't let fear control our actions.

422
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:28,950
<15-6,ALEXIS>想重新考虑吗
<15-6,ALEXIS>Care to rethink that?

423
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,190
<15-7,CASTLE>进去了
<15-7,CASTLE>Here we go.

424
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,590
<15-8,ALEXIS>都是什么啊
<15-8,ALEXIS>What is it all?

425
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:31,080
<15-9,CASTLE>看起来是调查
<15-9,CASTLE>Looks like research.

426
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,160
<15-10,ALEXIS>调查什么
<15-10,ALEXIS>Into what?

427
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,730
<15-11,CASTLE>世界末日
<15-11,CASTLE>The end of days.

428
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,390
<15-11,CASTLE>据这上面讲  就将发生在两天后
<15-11,CASTLE>Which, according to this, is two days from now.

429
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,600
<16-1,RYAN>天呐  我讨厌疯狂墙
<16-1,RYAN>Man, I hate walls of crazy.

430
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,960
<16-2,CASTLE>如果不是疯言疯语呢
<16-2,CASTLE>What if it's not crazy?

431
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,600
<16-2,CASTLE>肖认为天启将于两天后开始
<16-2,CASTLE>Shaw believed the apocalypse starts in two days.

432
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:53,680
<16-3,ALEXIS>那肖为什么要再进来这里
<16-3,ALEXIS>Then why did Shaw want to get back inside of here?

433
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,640
<16-3,ALEXIS>他想要什么
<16-3,ALEXIS>What was he after?

434
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,960
<16-4,HAYLEY>是啊  好问题
<16-4,HAYLEY>Yeah. It's a good question.

435
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,900
<16-4,HAYLEY>想想看  这些东西一直就在我们身旁
<16-4,HAYLEY>It's insane to think that this has all been sitting

436
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:58,650
<16-4,HAYLEY>太疯狂了
<16-4,HAYLEY>right next to us all this time.

437
00:17:58,650 --> 00:17:59,520
<16-5,ALEXIS>简直变态
<16-5,ALEXIS>It's twisted.

438
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,350
<16-5,ALEXIS>看来他们在跟踪这个男孩  维科特·克朗
<16-5,ALEXIS>Looks like they were following this boy, Victor Crowne.

439
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,050
<16-6,ESPOSITO>等等  克朗  那就是20年前
<16-6,ESPOSITO>Wait, Crowne. That was the family

440
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:06,210
<16-6,ESPOSITO>肖企图谋害的一家
<16-6,ESPOSITO>that Shaw tried to murder 20 years ago.

441
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,380
<16-6,ESPOSITO>是啊  我查了他们
<16-6,ESPOSITO>Yeah, I looked into them.

442
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,730
<16-7,RYAN>父母是沃伦和爱丽丝·克朗
<16-7,RYAN>Warren and Alice Crowne were the parents.

443
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:11,910
<16-7,RYAN>他们有个九岁儿子维科特
<16-7,RYAN>They had a nine-year-old boy named Victor.

444
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:13,830
<16-7,RYAN>更糟的是  肖的袭击没有杀死他们
<16-7,RYAN>What's worse, after surviving Shaw's attacks,

445
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:16,640
<16-7,RYAN>之后却在滑雪时遭遇诡异雪崩而死
<16-7,RYAN>they were killed in a freak skiing avalanche

446
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,230
<16-7,RYAN>维科特成了孤儿
<16-7,RYAN>and Victor became an orphan.

447
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,140
<16-8,ALEXIS>可怜的孩子
<16-8,ALEXIS>Poor kid.

448
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,570
<16-9,RYAN>是  也不是  他们是亿万富翁
<16-9,RYAN>Well, yes and no. They were billionaires.

449
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:23,260
<16-9,RYAN>维科特将继承全部财产
<16-9,RYAN>Victor stood to inherit the entire fortune.

450
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,770
<16-9,RYAN>开玩笑吗
<16-9,RYAN>Are you kidding me?

451
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,050
<16-10,CASTLE>各位  你们看出来了吧
<16-10,CASTLE>Guys, tell me you're seeing this.

452
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:31,500
<16-10,CASTLE>一名身处世界末日阴谋中央
<16-10,CASTLE>A targeted orphan standing to inherit an empire

453
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,230
<16-10,CASTLE>将继承大笔财产  被人盯上的孤儿
<16-10,CASTLE>in the center of a religious Armageddon plot?

454
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:35,660
<16-10,CASTLE>拜托
<16-10,CASTLE>Hello!

455
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,180
<16-10,CASTLE>这是《凶兆》
<16-10,CASTLE>It's "The Omen"!

456
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,920
<16-10,CASTLE>肖认定维科特·克朗是反基督者
<16-10,CASTLE>Shaw believed that Victor Crowne was the Antichrist.

457
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,980
<16-11,ALEXIS>是...你是指
<16-11,ALEXIS>The A-- as in...

458
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,140
<16-12,CASTLE>就是魔鬼的化身
<16-12,CASTLE>As in the personification of the devil.

459
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,820
<16-12,CASTLE>是的  亲爱的  没错
<16-12,CASTLE>Yes, dear. Yes. It --

460
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,980
<16-12,CASTLE>所以肖才会袭击克朗夫妇
<16-12,CASTLE>That's why Shaw went after the Crownes.

461
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,080
<16-12,CASTLE>他其实是想杀他们儿子
<16-12,CASTLE>He was going after their son.

462
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:51,170
<16-13,HAYLEY>但那是一部电影
<16-13,HAYLEY>Except that was a film.

463
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,230
<16-13,HAYLEY>别告诉我
<16-13,HAYLEY>Please don't tell me

464
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:53,990
<16-13,HAYLEY>你在谷歌反基督者
<16-13,HAYLEY>you are Googling the Antichrist right now.

465
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:55,950
<16-14,ALEXIS>我在调查维科特·克朗
<16-14,ALEXIS>I'm looking into Victor Crowne.

466
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:57,980
<16-14,ALEXIS>他还住在纽约
<16-14,ALEXIS>He still lives here in New York.

467
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:01,460
<16-15,ESPOSITO>如果肖认为维科特真是魔鬼
<16-15,ESPOSITO>If Shaw believed that Victor was some sort of devil,

468
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,610
<16-15,ESPOSITO>或许那是他从精神病院逃出来的原因
<16-15,ESPOSITO>maybe that's why he escaped from that institution --

469
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:05,090
<16-15,ESPOSITO>好去完成任务
<16-15,ESPOSITO>so that he could finish his mission.

470
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:06,620
<16-16,ALEXIS>据文章说  两天后
<16-16,ALEXIS>According to this article, in two days,

471
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,630
<16-16,ALEXIS>维科特·克朗就将满30岁  可以完全控制
<16-16,ALEXIS>Victor Crowne turns 30 and will gain full control

472
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:10,230
<16-16,ALEXIS>他父母的商业帝国
<16-16,ALEXIS>over his parents' empire.

473
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,170
<16-16,ALEXIS>这就对了
<16-16,ALEXIS>That's it.

474
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,450
<16-17,CASTLE>耶稣是30岁开始布道
<16-17,CASTLE>Jesus began his ministry when he was 30.

475
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:18,390
<16-17,CASTLE>很多人认为反基督者
<16-17,CASTLE>Many people believe that the Antichrist

477
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:21,070
<16-17,CASTLE>也将在同样的年龄开始统治地球
<16-17,CASTLE>will begin his reign on Earth at the same age.

478
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,670
<16-17,CASTLE>一旦他升天
<16-17,CASTLE>And that once his ascension has started,

479
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,230
<16-17,CASTLE>就无法阻止他了
<16-17,CASTLE>it cannot be stopped.

480
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:28,720
<16-17,CASTLE>各位  如果维科特·克朗真是反基督者
<16-17,CASTLE>Guys, what if Victor Crowne is the Antichrist

481
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,830
<16-17,CASTLE>肖并没疯呢
<16-17,CASTLE>and Shaw isn't crazy?

482
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:31,880
<16-18,HAYLEY>不  里克  他绝对是疯子
<16-18,HAYLEY>No, Rick. He was very crazy.

490
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,160
<16-18,HAYLEY>记得吗  他想杀个孩子
<16-18,HAYLEY>Remember -- he tried to kill a child.

498
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,710
<16-19,ESPOSITO>我们还没把肖逃跑后的
<16-19,ESPOSITO>You know, we still haven't accounted for

499
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:36,500
<16-19,ESPOSITO>时间线都查清
<16-19,ESPOSITO>all of Shaw's time after he escaped.

500
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:38,090
<16-19,ESPOSITO>如果他仍然执念于杀死维科特
<16-19,ESPOSITO>If he's still obsessed with killing Victor,

501
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:39,840
<16-19,ESPOSITO>那昨晚他就很有可能是冲着杀人去的
<16-19,ESPOSITO>there's a chance he took a run at him last night.

502
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,890
<16-20,ALEXIS>可维科特已经是成年人  有能力保护自己
<16-20,ALEXIS>Except Victor is a full-grown man now, able to defend himself.

503
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,210
<16-21,ESPOSITO>如果维科特在自卫过程中刺伤了肖
<16-21,ESPOSITO>And if Victor stabbed Shaw in self-defense,

504
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,860
<16-21,ESPOSITO>他也许因为害怕而不敢站出来
<16-21,ESPOSITO>he might be too afraid to come forward.

505
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,500
<16-22,RYAN>我们得和这个人谈谈
<16-22,RYAN>We need to talk to this guy.

506
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:55,280
<17-1,CASTLE>拜托  大半个城市都断电了
<17-1,CASTLE>Come on. Half the city is blacked out,

507
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,290
<17-1,CASTLE>这里居然还亮的像棵圣诞树
<17-1,CASTLE>but this place is lit up like a Christmas tree?

508
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:59,970
<17-2,ESPOSITO>-也许是用发电机发的电呢  -没错
<17-2,ESPOSITO>- The lights probably run on generators. - Sure.

509
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:02,620
<17-3,CASTLE>用地狱之火驱动的热能发电机
<17-3,CASTLE>Thermoelectric generator fueled by the flames of Hell.

510

<17-3,CASTLE>看看这个  伙计们  看这个
<17-3,CASTLE>Check this out, you guys. Look at this.

511
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:08,130
<17-3,CASTLE>身家亿万的企业家一心要用他的
<17-3,CASTLE>Billionaire entrepreneur hell-bent on "Saving the world"

<17-3,CASTLE>with his water reclamation project? I'm sure.

513
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,150
<17-4,RYAN>卡塞尔  众所周知  维科特·克朗
<17-4,RYAN>Castle, by all accounts, Victor Crowne has helped

514
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,520
<17-4,RYAN>通过提供干净的饮用水
<17-4,RYAN>millions of impoverished people

515
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,520
<17-4,RYAN>帮助了很多贫困的人
<17-4,RYAN>by providing them with clean drinking water.

516
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,950
<17-5,CASTLE>或者是用它来感染我们
<17-5,CASTLE>Or is he infecting us with it?

517
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,500
<17-7,ROLLINS>先生们  请跟我这边走
<17-7,ROLLINS>Gentlemen, follow me this way, please.

518
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,040
<17-8,ESPOSITO>你从保险箱里偷了这个来保护你自己
<17-8,ESPOSITO>You stole this from the safe to protect yourself?!

519
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:24,990
<17-9,RYAN>卡塞尔
<17-9,RYAN>Castle!

520
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:27,600
<17-10,CASTLE>怎么了  你们有枪保护
<17-10,CASTLE>What?! You guys have guns.

521
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:34,020
<18-1,VICTOR CROWNE>纽约警局
<18-1,VICTOR CROWNE>The NYPD.

522
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:37,120
<18-1,VICTOR CROWNE>还有理查德·卡塞尔本人
<18-1,VICTOR CROWNE>And Richard Castle in the flesh.

523
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,600
<18-1,VICTOR CROWNE>我是你们所有人的粉丝
<18-1,VICTOR CROWNE>I'm fans of you all.

524
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,780
<18-2,CROWNE>你身上有静电
<18-2,CROWNE>Yikes! You got a shock.

525
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:44,800
<18-2,CROWNE>这可真让人讨厌  不是吗
<18-2,CROWNE>Don't you hate when that happens?

526
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:47,790
<18-2,CROWNE>有什么可以让我为诸位效劳呢
<18-2,CROWNE>So, how can I help you fine gentlemen?

527
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,640
<18-3,RYAN>克朗先生  我们想问几个关于这个人的问题
<18-3,RYAN>Mr. Crowne, we just have some questions about this man.

528
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,770
<18-4,CASTLE>看来你认出他是谁了
<18-4,CASTLE>I take it you recognize him.

529
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,530
<18-5,CROWNE>加百列·肖  永生难忘
<18-5,CROWNE>Gabriel Shaw. Hard face to forget.

530
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:00,990
<18-6,ESPOSITO>你最近见过他吗
<18-6,ESPOSITO>Have you seen him recently?

531
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:03,230
<18-7,CROWNE>你们到底想说什么
<18-7,CROWNE>Okay, what's this all about?

532
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,120
<18-7,CROWNE>肖死了
<18-7,CROWNE>Shaw is dead.

533
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,470
<18-8,RYAN>他昨天下午从皮科莫逃走
<18-8,RYAN>He escaped from Peakmore yesterday afternoon

534
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:07,880
<18-8,RYAN>之后在夜里被杀害
<18-8,RYAN>and was killed later that evening.

535
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,060
<18-9,CASTLE>你看起来很高兴
<18-9,CASTLE>You seem pleased.

536
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:13,120
<18-10,CROWNE>这人袭击了我的家人  卡塞尔先生
<18-10,CROWNE>The man attacked my family, Mr. Castle.

537
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:16,100
<18-10,CROWNE>别指望我为他的死掉一滴眼泪
<18-10,CROWNE>Don't expect me to shed a tear over his demise.

538
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:19,430
<18-10,CROWNE>20年了  这张脸让我不得安宁
<18-10,CROWNE>20 years, this face has haunted me.

539
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,390
<18-11,ESPOSITO>为什么这样
<18-11,ESPOSITO>How's that?

540
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:23,470
<18-12,CROWNE>受袭后  我父母带我离开了这座城市
<18-12,CROWNE>Days after his attack, my parents and I left the city.

541
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,130
<18-12,CROWNE>我的父母死于途中一场诡异的事故
<18-12,CROWNE>My parents perished in a freak accident on that trip.

542
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:27,590
<18-13,CASTLE>你认为他们的死是肖的错
<18-13,CASTLE>You blame Shaw for their deaths.

543
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,290
<18-14,CROWNE>他触发了连锁反应
<18-14,CROWNE>He set those events in motion.

544
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:31,490
<18-14,CROWNE>那个人永久地诅咒了我的人生
<18-14,CROWNE>That man forever cursed my life.

545
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:33,870
<18-14,CROWNE>但我把我的痛苦化作福祉
<18-14,CROWNE>But I've turned my pain into a blessing.

546
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:36,210
<18-14,CROWNE>把所有的负能量
<18-14,CROWNE>Channeled all that negative energy

547
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:39,680
<18-14,CROWNE>投入到一个造福人类的计划
<18-14,CROWNE>into a plan for something good -- a better world.

<18-14,CROWNE>这个全球项目计划
<18-14,CROWNE>in just a couple of days.

<18-15,CASTLE>在你30岁生日的时候
<18-15,CASTLE>On your 30th birthday.

552
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,240
<18-16,CROWNE>恰巧  是的
<18-16,CROWNE>As it so happens, yes.

553
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,660
<18-17,ESPOSITO>尽管我不想  克朗先生
<18-17,ESPOSITO>Well, I hate to have to ask you this, Mr. Crowne,

554
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,080
<18-17,ESPOSITO>但我还是要问昨天晚上你在哪里
<18-17,ESPOSITO>but where were you last night?

555
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,400
<18-18,CROWNE>这里  工作

<18-18,CROWNE>如果你们想核实的话
<18-18,CROWNE>if you'd like to verify that.

558
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:07,580
<18-18,CROWNE>说完了
<18-18,CROWNE>We're done here.

561
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,270
<18-20,CASTLE>什么东西闻起来像是

562
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,210
<18-20,CASTLE>硫磺
<18-20,CASTLE>Sulfur.

<20-1,ESPOSITO>伙计  你可别再看那些恐怖片了
<20-1,ESPOSITO>Bro, you have to stop watching these horror films.

578
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:15,950
<20-2,CASTLE>跟罪案现场照片里
<20-2,CASTLE>That same slash of light

579
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:17,560
<20-2,CASTLE>出现的光线一模一样
<20-2,CASTLE>appeared in the crime-scene photos, okay?

580
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,930
<20-2,CASTLE>位置也一样  就在我的脖子上
<20-2,CASTLE>In the exact same place -- right across my neck.

581
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:21,920
<20-4,CASTLE>现在视频里又出现了
<20-4,CASTLE>Now it's showing up again in the video feed?

<20-4,CASTLE>那是实时监控  不可能被动手脚
<20-4,CASTLE>That's live feed! That cannot be manipulated!

583
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:27,500
<20-5,RYAN>卡塞尔  所有关于凶兆和反基督者...
<20-5,RYAN>Castle, all this stuff about omens and the Antichrist --

584
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,570
<20-6,ESPOSITO>你被死亡标记等等
<20-6,ESPOSITO>You being marked for death...

585
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:29,600
<20-7,RYAN>都是你胡思乱想的
<20-7,RYAN>It's all in your head.

586
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:30,980
<20-10,RYAN>-伙计们  -小心
<20-10,RYAN>- Guys -- - Look out!

587
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,000
<20-11,CASTLE>现在又怎么说呢
<20-11,CASTLE>You were saying?!

588
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,640
<21-1,BECKETT>碰巧绳子磨损严重而已
<21-1,BECKETT>It was a frayed cable.

589
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,820
<21-2,CASTLE>是是  我同意  如果你说的破绳子是指撒旦的话
<21-2,CASTLE>Yes. Yes, I agree. If by frayed cable, you mean Satan.

590
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:46,230
<21-3,BECKETT>听着  卡塞尔  别误会
<21-3,BECKETT>Look, Castle, don't take this the wrong way,

591
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,870
<21-3,BECKETT>你听起来有点发疯
<21-3,BECKETT>but you're starting to sound crazy.

592
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:51,120
<21-3,BECKETT>不是你平日里的那种疯  而是变本加厉的疯
<21-3,BECKETT>And not your usual crazy, I mean, next-level nutter.

593
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,610
<21-4,CASTLE>贝克特  听我说
<21-4,CASTLE>Beckett, listen to me.

594
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:56,000
<21-4,CASTLE>我看着维科特·克朗冷漠无情的眼睛
<21-4,CASTLE>I looked into the cold, soulless eyes of Victor Crowne,

595
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,050
<21-4,CASTLE>告诉你我看到了什么...
<21-4,CASTLE>and let me tell you what I saw --

596
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:00,640
<21-4,CASTLE>邪恶
<21-4,CASTLE>Evil.

597
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,520
<21-5,BECKETT>我看了维科特·克朗的
<21-5,BECKETT>Well, I looked into the surveillance tapes

598
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,520
<21-5,BECKETT>大楼监控录像
<21-5,BECKETT>from Victor Crowne's building,

599
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,370
<21-5,BECKETT>告诉你我看到了什么
<21-5,BECKETT>and let me tell you what I saw --

600
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:08,950
<21-5,BECKETT>维科特·克朗整晚都在工作
<21-5,BECKETT>Victor Crowne working all night.

601
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,570
<21-5,BECKETT>他根本没有离开过大楼  卡塞尔
<21-5,BECKETT>He never left the building, Castle.

602
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:11,580
<21-5,BECKETT>他不是我们的凶手
<21-5,BECKETT>He's not our killer.

603
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,770
<21-6,CASTLE>他不受地球上的规则约束  贝克特
<21-6,CASTLE>He's not gonna be bound by earthly laws, Beckett.

604
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:15,050
<21-6,CASTLE>恶魔的基础常识
<21-6,CASTLE>That's Demon 101.

605
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:16,250
<21-7,ESPOSITO>警监
<21-7,ESPOSITO>Yo, Cap.

606
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,640
<21-7,ESPOSITO>我们还是没弄清楚案发期间
<21-7,ESPOSITO>We're still not having any luck figuring out where Shaw was

607
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,930
<21-7,ESPOSITO>肖到底在哪里
<21-7,ESPOSITO>during that time-of-death window.

608
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:20,960
<21-8,BECKETT>一定有人见过他
<21-8,BECKETT>Well, someone must've seen him,

609
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,870
<21-8,BECKETT>-不如让警员再排查一遍吧  -好的
<21-8,BECKETT>- so why don't we get unis to re-canvass? - All right.

610
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:25,120
<21-10,RYAN>我刚刚接到蕾妮的电话
<21-10,RYAN>Yo, I just got a call from Lanie.

611
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,530
<21-10,RYAN>你们还记得印在受害者尸体上的
<21-10,RYAN>Uh, do you remember the biblical verses

612
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:27,720
<21-10,RYAN>圣经章节吗
<21-10,RYAN>painted all over our Vic's body?

613
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,360
<21-10,RYAN>实验室做了分析  而结果非常奇怪
<21-10,RYAN>Well, the lab ran an analysis, and the results are...odd.

614
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,210
<21-10,RYAN>颜料是一种由橄榄油
<21-10,RYAN>It's a paste made from a mixture

615
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:35,930
<21-10,RYAN>肉桂  桂皮  香茅  没药混合而成
<21-10,RYAN>of olive oil, cassia, cinnamon, cymbopogon, and myrrh.

617
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:38,790
<21-11,CASTLE>香茅和没药吗  我好像在哪见过
<21-11,CASTLE>Cymbopogon and myrrh? I've seen this somewhere before.

618
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,000
<21-11,CASTLE>我发誓
<21-11,CASTLE>I swear it.

619
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:43,250
<21-11,CASTLE>-跟上  -好吧
<21-11,CASTLE>- Go. - All right.

620
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:45,590
<22-1,CASTLE>大家好
<22-1,CASTLE>Hey, guys.

621
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:46,590
<22-2,ALEXIS>爸爸
<22-2,ALEXIS>Hey, Dad.

622
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:48,900
<22-2,ALEXIS>你简直无法相信我们在这找到了什么
<22-2,ALEXIS>You wouldn't believe some of the stuff we're finding in here.

623
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,750
<22-3,CASTLE>你有找到过一份食谱吗
<22-3,CASTLE>Did you find a recipe?

624
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,270
<22-4,ALEXIS>什么的食谱  反基督者饼干吗
<22-4,ALEXIS>For what? Antichrist cookies?

625
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:54,460
<22-5,CASTLE>不  当然不是
<22-5,CASTLE>No, of course not.

626
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:56,430
<22-6,CASTLE>但实际上  我也不知道
<22-6,CASTLE>But, actually, I don't even know.

627
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,150
<22-6,CASTLE>我只知道我在这看到过一封有写食谱的信
<22-6,CASTLE>All I know is I saw a letter in here that had a recipe on it

628
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:02,300
<22-6,CASTLE>里面提到了橄榄油  肉桂  桂皮  香茅和没药
<22-6,CASTLE>with olive oil, cassia, cinnamon, cymbopogon, and myrrh.

629
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,540
<22-6,CASTLE>等等  怎么听起来这么耳熟呢
<22-6,CASTLE>Wait, wait, wait a minute. Why does that sound so familiar?

630
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:06,280
<22-6,CASTLE>等等  等一下
<22-6,CASTLE>Hold on, hold on, hold on.

631
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:09,910
<22-7,HAYLEY>对  在这
<22-7,HAYLEY>Yeah, here it is.

632
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:14,760
<22-7,HAYLEY>是一个叫卡尔·冯·埃克兰的人写给加百列·肖的
<22-7,HAYLEY>It's addressed to Gabriel Shaw from a Karl Von Eckland.

633
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:17,830
<22-7,HAYLEY>这封信里面一直在说一种膏油
<22-7,HAYLEY>Now the letter goes on and on and on about anointing oil.

634
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:20,520
<22-7,HAYLEY>是古时候用来准备
<22-7,HAYLEY>It was used in ancient times to prepare the righteous

635
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,040
<22-7,HAYLEY>与恶魔战斗的东西
<22-7,HAYLEY>for battle against demons,

636
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:26,210
<21-11,CASTLE>它的原材料包含了香茅和没药
<21-11,CASTLE>and the ingredients include cymbopogon and myrrh.

637
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:27,870
<22-6,CASTLE>来听一下这部分
<22-6,CASTLE>Okay, now listen to this part.

638
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:30,490
<22-7,HAYLEY>"轮到你听从召唤
<22-7,HAYLEY>"Find me when it's your turn to answer the call.

639
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:33,330
<22-7,HAYLEY>我会帮你准备抵抗魔鬼的战斗"
<22-7,HAYLEY>I will prepare you - for your battle against evil."

640
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,870
<22-8,ESPOSITO>写这个的人是谁来着
<22-8,ESPOSITO>And who's the guy who wrote that?

641
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:36,370
<22-9,RYAN>卡尔·冯·埃克兰
<22-9,RYAN>Karl Von Eckland.

642
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:37,890
<22-10,CASTLE>我们确实得跟这人谈谈
<22-10,CASTLE>We really need to talk to this guy.

643
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:39,920
<22-11,RYAN>但他已经死了
<22-11,RYAN>Well, um, he's dead.

644
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,290
<22-11,RYAN>除非你在这找个通灵板
<22-11,RYAN>So, unless you have a Ouija board somewhere around here,

645
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:43,300
<22-11,RYAN>这难度恐怕有点大
<22-11,RYAN>it might be a bit of a challenge.

646
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,260
<22-12,ALEXIS>他怎么死的
<22-12,ALEXIS>How did he die?

647
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:48,650
<22-13,RYAN>貌似是1996年12月13日心脏病突发
<22-13,RYAN>Looks like he had a fatal heart attack on December 13, 1996.

648
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:51,420
<22-14,HAYLEY>就是写完这封信的一个月之后
<22-14,HAYLEY>That is just one month after this letter was written.

649
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:53,490
<22-15,ESPOSITO>也是加百列·肖被送到皮科莫的一周后
<22-15,ESPOSITO>And a week after Gabriel Shaw was sent to Peakmore.

650
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:55,710
<22-16,CASTLE>等等  如果肖被关在精神病院
<22-16,CASTLE>Wait a minute. If Shaw was institutionalized,

651
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:58,100
<22-16,CASTLE>很有可能他不知道卡尔·冯·埃克兰死了
<22-16,CASTLE>it's possible he didn't know Karl Von Eckland was dead.

652
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,270
<22-17,ALEXIS>也就是说他逃出来以后
<22-17,ALEXIS>Which means after he broke out,

653
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:01,360
<22-17,ALEXIS>他可能会去冯·埃克兰的公寓里
<22-17,ALEXIS>he probably went to Von Eckland's apartment to get prepared

654
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,010
<22-17,ALEXIS>为他要面对的恶魔之战做准备
<22-17,ALEXIS>for his supposed demonic battle.

655
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,330
<22-18,CASTLE>莱恩  现在住在冯·埃克兰公寓里的是谁
<22-18,CASTLE>Ryan, who lives in Von Eckland's apartment now?

656
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:06,620
<22-19,RYAN>他的儿子奥斯卡
<22-19,RYAN>His son, Oscar.

657
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:08,740
<22-19,RYAN>似乎他父亲死后他就搬进去了
<22-19,RYAN>Looks like he moved in after his father died.

658
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:10,210
<23-1,CASTLE>地方不错
<23-1,CASTLE>Nice place.

659
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:14,020
<23-1,CASTLE>真是不拘一格
<23-1,CASTLE>It's very, uh... eclectic.

660
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,260
<23-2,OSCAR VON ECKLUND>是  也诡异得要命
<23-2,OSCAR VON ECKLUND>Yeah, it's creepy as all hell,

661
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:17,900
<23-2,OSCAR VON ECKLUND>但都是我爸爸的旧物
<23-2,OSCAR VON ECKLUND>but it's my dad's old stuff.

662
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:20,000
<23-2,OSCAR VON ECKLUND>实在不忍心把这些丢掉
<23-2,OSCAR VON ECKLUND>Never had the heart to get rid of any of it.

663
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:22,810
<23-3,CASTLE>你没有继承你父亲的宗教事业吗
<23-3,CASTLE>So, you didn't follow in your father's religious footsteps?

664
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:24,880
<23-3,CASTLE>当然没有
<23-3,CASTLE>Hell, no.

665
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,420
<23-4,OSCAR>都是迷信罢了
<23-4,OSCAR>It's all mumbo jumbo.

666
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,590
<23-5,ESPOSITO>二十块吗
<23-5,ESPOSITO>20 bucks?

667
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:29,140
<23-5,ESPOSITO>总要混口饭吃不是吗
<23-5,ESPOSITO>Hey, a man's got to eat, right?

668
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,270
<23-6,OSCAR>所以我就在这赚点小钱
<23-6,OSCAR>So, I make a little money on the side.

669
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:33,490
<23-6,OSCAR>就把这些神圣的废物卖给那些傻子
<23-6,OSCAR>You know, selling blessed crap to suckers.

670
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:36,000
<23-6,OSCAR>有祝福的蜡烛  神圣的十字架
<23-6,OSCAR>Yeah, blessed candles, blessed crosses.

671
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:38,110
<23-6,OSCAR>你对祝福手链感兴趣吗
<23-6,OSCAR>Can I interest you in a blessed bracelet?

672
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:41,570
<23-7,RYAN>没有  但我们对这个人有兴趣
<23-7,RYAN>No, but, uh, we are interested in this man.

673
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:43,200
<23-7,RYAN>他昨晚来了这吗
<23-7,RYAN>Was he here last night?

674
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:46,340
<23-8,OSCAR>对  六点左右
<23-8,OSCAR>Yeah. Around 6:00.

675
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,890
<23-8,OSCAR>叫加百列什么的吗
<23-8,OSCAR>Gabriel something?

676
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,200
<23-8,OSCAR>来找我爸
<23-8,OSCAR>Was looking for my old man.

677
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,050
<23-9,CASTLE>他想让你父亲给他抹点神油
<23-9,CASTLE>He wanted your father to anoint him

678
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:52,790
<23-9,CASTLE>为一场圣战做准备
<23-9,CASTLE>with the oil for spiritual battle.

679
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:54,350
<23-10,OSCAR>你怎么知道
<23-10,OSCAR>How do you know that?

680
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,840
<23-11,ESPOSITO>你给他抹神油了吗  奥斯卡
<23-11,ESPOSITO>Did you anoint him, Oscar?

681
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:59,300
<23-12,OSCAR>五十块  当然抹了
<23-12,OSCAR>For 50 bucks, hell yeah, I did.

682
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:01,450
<23-12,OSCAR>怎么了  他很坚持想要
<23-12,OSCAR>What? He was desperate,

683
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:03,330
<23-12,OSCAR>于是我就找了本我爸的旧书
<23-12,OSCAR>so I grabbed one of Pop's old books,

684
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:06,210
<23-12,OSCAR>然后就做了一点神油出来
<23-12,OSCAR>and I whipped up a batch of the anointing oil,

685
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,220
<23-12,OSCAR>我还在他身上写了点圣经章节
<23-12,OSCAR>and I, uh, wrote some bible verses on him.

686
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:11,300
<23-12,OSCAR>这让他平静了很多
<23-12,OSCAR>It gave him great peace.

687
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:13,590
<23-13,RYAN>但这平静没持续多久  那人已经死了
<23-13,RYAN>Well, that peace didn't last. The man's dead.

688
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:17,020
<23-14,OSCAR>真的吗  他怎么了
<23-14,OSCAR>Really? What happened to him?

689
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,200
<23-15,CASTLE>他被撒旦的子嗣杀死了
<23-15,CASTLE>He was murdered... by the spawn of Satan.

690
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:21,330
<23-16,OSCAR>-他是说真的吗  -很认真
<23-16,OSCAR>- Is he serious? - Very.

691
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,900
<23-17,ESPOSITO>奥斯卡  加百列·肖有没有告诉你
<23-17,ESPOSITO>So, Oscar, did Gabriel Shaw

692
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,760
<23-18,ESPOSITO>他要去见什么人
<23-18,ESPOSITO>tell you whether he was meeting anyone?

693
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:28,770
<23-18,ESPOSITO>他有说他要去哪吗
<23-18,ESPOSITO>Did he say where he was going?

694
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:31,230
<23-19,OSCAR>没有  他谢了我然后就走了
<23-19,OSCAR>No, just thanked me and left.

695
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,890
<23-20,ESPOSITO>-他几点走的  -七点半过一点
<23-20,ESPOSITO>- What time did he leave? - A little after 7:30.

696
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:36,280
<23-20,ESPOSITO>就是肖被刺前三十分钟
<23-20,ESPOSITO>That's 30 minutes before Shaw was stabbed.

697
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,740
<24-1,CASTLE>伙计们  我们很接近了
<24-1,CASTLE>Guys, we're getting close.

698
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:40,280
<24-1,CASTLE>所以有好消息也有坏消息
<24-1,CASTLE>Okay, so good and bad news.

699
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,950
<24-1,CASTLE>好消息就是我们找到了
<24-1,CASTLE>The good news is we found surveillance footage

700
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:45,350
<25-1,RYAN>肖在奥斯卡家附近的监控录像
<25-1,RYAN>of Shaw in Oscar's neighborhood

701
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:47,000
<25-1,RYAN>这样我们就能找到
<25-1,RYAN>and we were able to track him back

702
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:48,410
<25-1,RYAN>他被刺的位置是哪
<25-1,RYAN>to the location where he was stabbed.

703
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:49,970
<25-2,CASTLE>你们有加百列·肖被害的录像吗
<25-2,CASTLE>You have video of Gabriel Shaw's murder?

704
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:52,270
<25-3,ESPOSITO>算是有吧
<25-3,ESPOSITO>Well, yeah. Uh, sort of.

705
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:54,840
<25-4,BECKETT>所以就有坏消息了是吧
<25-4,BECKETT>This is where the bad news comes in.

706
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:57,020
<25-5,RYAN>由于那场雷暴雨
<25-5,RYAN>It appears that due to the thunderstorm,

707
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:59,490
<25-5,RYAN>所有的监控摄像都有点失灵了
<25-5,RYAN>none of the cameras are functioning properly.

708
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:01,170
<25-6,BECKETT>什么意思
<25-6,BECKETT>What does that mean?

709
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:05,140
<25-7,ESPOSITO>这个  这有点怪
<25-7,ESPOSITO>It -- Uh...It's just gonna be sort of...odd.

710
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:07,710
<25-8,CASTLE>一般的奇怪吗  还是魔鬼般诡异那种怪
<25-8,CASTLE>Like odd odd? Or work of the Devil odd?

711
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:10,730
<25-9,ESPOSITO>不  就一般的奇怪  卡塞尔  好吗
<25-9,ESPOSITO>No, just odd odd, Castle, all right?

712
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:11,930
<25-10,RYAN>-放吧  -好的
<25-10,RYAN>- Go ahead. - Okay.

713
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:42,920
<25-12,RYAN>那就是恶魔
<25-12,RYAN>That...is a demon.

714
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:44,000
<25-13,CASTLE>朋友们  你们做到了
<25-13,CASTLE>You guys, you did it.

715
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,880
<25-13,CASTLE>你们手上有加百列·肖
<25-13,CASTLE>You have video of Gabriel Shaw

716
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,100
<25-13,CASTLE>被不属于这世上的东西杀害的录像
<25-13,CASTLE>killed by something not of this world.

717
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,170
<25-13,CASTLE>行了  卡塞尔  别激动
<25-13,CASTLE>All right, Castle. Easy.

718
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:52,150
<25-14,BECKETT>听着大家伙  我知道是有点晚
<25-14,BECKETT>Look, guys, I-I know it's late,

719
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:54,120
<25-14,BECKETT>但我要你们去一趟那个码头
<25-14,BECKETT>but I need you to go down to that loading dock

720
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,040
<25-14,BECKETT>看能不能找到什么线索  拜托了
<25-14,BECKETT>and see what you can find, please.

721
00:28:57,010 --> 00:28:57,600
<25-15,RYAN>好
<25-15,RYAN>Yeah.

722

<25-16,BECKETT>辛苦了
<25-16,BECKETT>Thank you.

723
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:00,520
<25-17,BECKETT>我去收拾一下
<25-17,BECKETT>I'm gonna go pack up.

724
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,700
<25-17,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<25-17,BECKETT>And, um...Castle?

725
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:06,070
<25-17,BECKETT>只是故障而已
<25-17,BECKETT>It's just a glitch.

726
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,200
<26-1,CASTLE>"反基督者出现
<26-1,CASTLE>"And the beast shall rise

727
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,470
<26-1,CASTLE>示以精明非凡之象
<26-1,CASTLE>and appear as astute and miraculous --

728
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,430
<26-1,CASTLE>领袖借由繁荣及平和之态
<26-1,CASTLE>the leader who comes into power

729
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:28,210
<26-1,CASTLE>上台掌权
<26-1,CASTLE>on a platform of prosperity and peace."

730
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:31,550
<26-1,CASTLE>或者简而言之
<26-1,CASTLE>Or, in a nutshell,

731
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,210
<26-2,CASTLE>维科特·克朗
<26-2,CASTLE>Victor Crowne.

732
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:32,580
<26-2,CASTLE>我的妈呀
<26-2,CASTLE>Geez!

733
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:36,050
<26-3,BECKETT>吓到你啦
<26-3,BECKETT>Gotcha.

734
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,700
<26-4,CASTLE>一点都不好玩  贝克特
<26-4,CASTLE>Not funny, Beckett!

735
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,390
<26-4,CASTLE>我被神秘力量盯上了
<26-4,CASTLE>I am being targeted by dark forces.

736
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:40,660
<26-4,CASTLE>我是认真的  我能感觉到
<26-4,CASTLE>I'm serious. I can feel it.

737
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:42,820
<26-5,BECKETT>好吧  但你明天再感觉行不行
<26-5,BECKETT>Okay, fine. Can you just feel it in the morning?

738
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,670
<26-5,BECKETT>已经很晚了  去睡吧
<26-5,BECKETT>'Cause it's late. Let's go to bed.

739
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,740
<26-6,CASTLE>行  我一会儿就去
<26-6,CASTLE>Yeah, just give me a few minutes.

740
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:48,530
<26-7,BECKETT>好吧
<26-7,BECKETT>All right.

741
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:52,370
<26-8,BECKETT>-吓  -我的妈呀
<26-8,BECKETT>- Boo! - Geez!

742
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,660
<26-10,BECKETT>你太好唬啦
<26-10,BECKETT>You're so easy!

747
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:11,860
<27-1,CASTLE>天使匕首
<27-1,CASTLE>The Angel Dagger.

748
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,490
<27-1,CASTLE>在哪见过来着
<27-1,CASTLE>Where have I seen --

749
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,000
<28-1,CASTLE>贝克特
<28-1,CASTLE>Hey, Beckett.

750
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,150
<28-2,BECKETT>你在哪
<28-2,BECKETT>Hey, where are you?

751
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:50,760
<28-3,CASTLE>我在办公室
<28-3,CASTLE>I'm at the office.

752
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,850
<28-3,CASTLE>我知道肖为什么要闯进来了
<28-3,CASTLE>I figured out why Shaw broke in here.

753
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:53,790
<28-4,BECKETT>-是吗  -对
<28-4,BECKETT>- Really? - Yeah.

754
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:55,950
<28-5,CASTLE>他是来找一把兵器的
<28-5,CASTLE>He was looking for a weapon.

755
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:57,960
<28-5,CASTLE>能杀死反基督者的唯一兵器
<28-5,CASTLE>It's the only thing that can kill the Antichrist.

756
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,630
<28-5,CASTLE>叫天使匕首
<28-5,CASTLE>It's called the Angel Dagger.

757
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,990
<28-6,BECKETT>卡塞尔  别闹了
<28-6,BECKETT>Castle, would you please just --

758
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:01,970
<28-6,BECKETT>贝克特  我没开玩笑
<28-6,BECKETT>Beckett, I am serious.

759
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:05,150
<28-7,CASTLE>我在网上找到了相关信息  而且匕首就在这
<28-7,CASTLE>I-I found references to it on the Internet, and it was here.

760
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:07,290
<28-7,CASTLE>一直放在保险箱里
<28-7,CASTLE>It's been in the safe the whole time.

761
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:09,540
<28-7,CASTLE>刀身就藏在...
<28-7,CASTLE>I-It's a blade that was hidden in a --

762
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,650
<28-8,CASTLE>-谁在那  -谁在那
<28-8,CASTLE>- Who's there? - Who's where?

763
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:16,430
<28-10,BECKETT>喂  卡塞尔
<28-10,BECKETT>Hello? Castle --

764
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,510
<28-11,CASTLE>他来了
<28-11,CASTLE>He's here.

765
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:20,700
<28-12,BECKETT>谁
<28-12,BECKETT>Who?

766
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:23,550
<28-13,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<28-13,BECKETT>Castle?

767
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,250
<28-14,BECKETT>喂
<28-14,BECKETT>Hello?

768
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:41,610
<29-1,CASTLE>我看到他的眼睛了  他是恶魔
<29-1,CASTLE>I saw his eyes. It was a demon.

769
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:44,710
<29-2,BECKETT>或者只是个戴了夜视镜的人
<29-2,BECKETT>Or someone with night-vision goggles.

770
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:46,450
<29-3,CASTLE>贝克特  你还要多少证据
<29-3,CASTLE>Beckett, how much proof do you need

771
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:47,530
<29-3,CASTLE>才能相信
<29-3,CASTLE>before you finally accept the fact

772
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:49,270
<29-3,CASTLE>你丈夫已经被标记了死亡
<29-3,CASTLE>that your husband has been marked for death!

773
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,770
<29-3,CASTLE>如果你真的被标记了死亡
<29-3,CASTLE>Okay, if you were marked for death,

774
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:51,890
<29-4,BECKETT>那恶魔早就杀了你
<29-4,BECKETT>then the demon would've killed you.

775
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:54,800
<29-4,BECKETT>相反  那个人偷袭敲晕你
<29-4,BECKETT>Instead, you were knocked out by a very human attacker

776
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,780
<29-4,BECKETT>然后抢走你说的那个什么鬼匕首
<29-4,BECKETT>who managed to run off with your...w-whatever dagger.

777
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:58,830
<29-6,ALEXIS>-天使匕首  -是天使匕首
<29-6,ALEXIS>- Angel Dagger! - Angel -- Angel Dagger.

778
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:01,190
<29-7,CASTLE>天使匕首  只有恶魔才会想得到的东西
<29-7,CASTLE>Angel Dagger. It's something only a demon would want.

779
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,800
<29-8,BECKETT>如果是真的  那为什么恶魔要洗劫你的保险箱
<29-8,BECKETT>Look, if that's true, then why did the demon ransack your safe?

780
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,380
<29-9,CASTLE>当然是为了寻找其他有超自然能力的宝贝
<29-9,CASTLE>Hello? To look for other items with supernatural abilities.

781
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:10,700
<29-10,RYAN>-难道...  -卡塞尔
<29-10,RYAN>- Is it--  - Hey, Castle.

782
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:11,890
<29-10,RYAN>你没事吧  哥们
<29-10,RYAN>How you doing, buddy?

783
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:13,800
<29-11,CASTLE>我和魔鬼对视了
<29-11,CASTLE>Well, boys, I looked into the eyes of the devil,

784
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,040
<29-12,RYAN>就是这样
<29-12,RYAN>so there's that.

785
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,900
<29-13,ESPOSITO>他是不是脑震荡了
<29-13,ESPOSITO>Did they check him for a concussion?

786
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:20,210
<29-14,BECKETT>没  他只是有点受惊了
<29-14,BECKETT>Uh, no. He's fine. He's just a little shaken.

787
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:21,810
<29-14,BECKETT>你们调查出什么了吗
<29-14,BECKETT>You guys got anything on the canvass?

788
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:23,750
<29-15,ESPOSITO>有个保安在
<29-15,ESPOSITO>Yeah, a bouncer who was working at a club

789
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:26,130
<29-15,ESPOSITO>肖被刺现场对面的一家俱乐部上班
<29-15,ESPOSITO>across the alley from where Shaw's stabbing took place

790
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:27,850
<29-15,ESPOSITO>他看到了一辆银色探险者从那开出
<29-15,ESPOSITO>saw a gray Explorer tear ass out of there.

791
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:28,960
<29-16,BECKETT>有车牌号吗
<29-16,BECKETT>All right, did you get the plates?

792
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,500
<29-17,RYAN>没有  但我们不需要
<29-17,RYAN>Nope, and we don't need them.

793
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,820
<29-17,RYAN>因为这宗案件里只有一个人
<29-17,RYAN>Turns out there's only one person in this case

794
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,190
<29-17,RYAN>有银色探险者这款车
<29-17,RYAN>who has a gray Explorer.

795
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:36,500
<30-1,SONDRA>我是有  但那款车很多人开
<30-1,SONDRA>Oh, yeah? Well, a lot of people have that kind of SUV.

796
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,760
<30-2,RYAN>没错  但可没那么多人
<30-2,RYAN>Yes, but not a lot of people

797
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,830
<30-2,RYAN>车库里藏有凶器
<30-2,RYAN>have the murder weapon in their garage.

798
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:42,150
<30-2,RYAN>我们搜查了你家
<30-2,RYAN>See, we got a search warrant for your place,

799
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:46,580
<30-2,RYAN>找到了你的园林钳
<30-2,RYAN>and, uh, we found your garden claw.

800
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,510
<31-1,ESPOSITO>这解释了为什么肖尸体上有爪状伤痕
<31-1,ESPOSITO>So, that explains the claw-shaped wound on Shaw's body.

801
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:54,740
<31-1,ESPOSITO>看吧  卡塞尔
<31-1,ESPOSITO>See, Castle?

802
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:56,400
<31-1,ESPOSITO>根本没有恶魔
<31-1,ESPOSITO>No demon.

803
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:58,960
<31-2,CASTLE>那为什么肖尸体上
<31-2,CASTLE>Yeah, then, uh, why was there sulfur,

804
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,040
<31-2,CASTLE>会有硫磺呢
<31-2,CASTLE>i.e. Brimstone, found in Shaw's body.

805
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:04,910
<31-2,CASTLE>我们实验室对凶器作了检验
<31-2,CASTLE>Our labs did an analysis of the murder weapon,

806
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:07,820
<31-2,CASTLE>上面不仅有肖的血迹
<31-2,CASTLE>and not only did they find traces of Shaw's blood on it,

807
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:11,750
<32-1,RYAN>还有残存的含硫园艺肥分子
<32-1,RYAN>but they also found particles of sulfuric gardening fertilizer,

808
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:14,400
<32-1,RYAN>刚好能与死者伤口上的硫磺相匹配
<32-1,RYAN>which matches the sulfur we found in the wound.

809
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:18,170
<32-1,RYAN>有什么要补充吗
<32-1,RYAN>Anything else?

810
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,340
<32-1,RYAN>我只是想跟他讲道理
<32-1,RYAN>I was just trying to talk some sense into him,

811
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:25,050
<32-1,RYAN>但肖却不停地念叨他
<32-1,RYAN>but Shaw just started rambling

812
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:29,310
<32-1,RYAN>消除恶魔的使命
<32-1,RYAN>about his mission to vanquish evil.

813
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:31,990
<34-1,SONDRA>他才是真正的恶魔
<34-1,SONDRA>He was the true evil.

814
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:34,750
<34-1,SONDRA>如果你只是想和他讲道理
<34-1,SONDRA>If all you wanted to do was talk,

815
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:36,630
<34-2,BECKETT>那为什么要带凶器去
<34-2,BECKETT>then why did you bring the murder weapon?

816
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:42,420
<34-3,SONDRA>我在车里放了花店要用的工具
<34-3,SONDRA>I keep tools for my flower shop in my SUV.

817
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:47,130
<34-3,SONDRA>我也不知道怎么回事  他一直没完没了
<34-3,SONDRA>And, I don't know, he just started going on and on,

818
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,250
<34-3,SONDRA>然后我就抓起了钳子
<34-3,SONDRA>and I grabbed the claw.

819
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:56,620
<34-3,SONDRA>二十年前  那家伙毁了我的家庭
<34-3,SONDRA>20 years ago, that man ruined my family,

820
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:02,460
<34-3,SONDRA>我不能让他再毁一次
<34-3,SONDRA>and I couldn't let him do it all over again to us.

821
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,650
<34-4,BECKETT>克雷默太太  你为什么昨晚要闯入
<34-4,BECKETT>Mrs. Kramer, why did you break into

822
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:09,950
<34-4,BECKETT>你丈夫以前的办公室
<34-4,BECKETT>your husband's old office last night?

823
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:13,330
<34-5,SONDRA>你在说什么
<34-5,SONDRA>What are you talking about?

824
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:15,040
<34-6,BECKETT>没必要再隐瞒了
<34-6,BECKETT>There's no reason to lie now.

825
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,340
<34-6,BECKETT>我们知道是你拿了天使匕首
<34-6,BECKETT>We know you took the Angel Dagger.

826
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,990
<34-7,SONDRA>我整晚都和我儿子在一块
<34-7,SONDRA>I was home all night with my son.

827
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:31,730
<35-1,CASTLE>如果袭击我的不是她  那到底是谁呢
<35-1,CASTLE>If she wasn't the one who attacked me, who the hell did?

828
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:38,020
<35-1,CASTLE>有什么线索能找到卡塞尔的恶魔袭击者吗
<35-1,CASTLE>Yo, any evidence to help identify Castle's demonic assailant?

829
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:39,970
<36-1,ESPOSITO>没有  不过  里克  袭击你的人
<36-1,ESPOSITO>No, but, Rick, whoever attacked you

830
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:42,640
<36-2,HAYLEY>还拿走了关于克朗家族的所有档案
<36-2,HAYLEY>also took all of the files on the Crowne family.

831
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:44,160
<36-3,CASTLE>这个狡猾的魔鬼
<36-3,CASTLE>That sneaky little devil.

832
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:46,310
<36-3,CASTLE>是维科特·克朗干的
<36-3,CASTLE>It's Victor Crowne. He did this.

833
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,450
<36-4,ALEXIS>你怎么知道
<36-4,ALEXIS>How do you figure?

834
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:49,450
<36-5,CASTLE>很明显他是想拿走任何对他不利的东西
<36-5,CASTLE>Well, clearly he's trying to take possession of any weapon

835
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:52,240
<36-5,CASTLE>并且消除一切
<36-5,CASTLE>that could be used against him and erase any and all evidence

836
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,600
<36-5,CASTLE>能表明他撒旦之子身份的证据
<36-5,CASTLE>of his true identity as the spawn of Satan.

837
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,740
<36-6,RYAN>我们已经查过维科特·克朗了
<36-6,RYAN>We already looked into Victor Crowne.

838
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:58,490
<36-6,RYAN>他整晚都待在一家俱乐部庆祝三十岁生日
<36-6,RYAN>He was out celebrating all night at a club for his 30th birthday.

839
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:00,510
<36-7,CASTLE>那到底还有谁会这么不择手段呢
<36-7,CASTLE>Okay, who else is gonna go to such lengths?

840
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:03,310
<36-8,HAYLEY>不知道  不过他落了个东西
<36-8,HAYLEY>Well, we don't know, but they left a souvenir.

841
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:07,150
<36-8,HAYLEY>这不是保险箱里原来的东西
<36-8,HAYLEY>This was not in the original inventory of the safe's contents.

842
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:11,240
<36-9,ESPOSITO>这是奥斯卡·冯·埃克兰的手链
<36-9,ESPOSITO>Yo, that's Oscar Von Eckland's bracelet.

843
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,270
<36-10,CASTLE>为什么他会想要天使匕首
<36-10,CASTLE>Why would he want the Angel Dagger?

844
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:15,350
<36-11,RYAN>因为他一直参与其中
<36-11,RYAN>Because he was in on it the whole time.

845
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,520
<36-11,RYAN>你们记得精神病院里
<36-11,RYAN>Do you remember the distorted image

846
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,170
<36-11,RYAN>肖的神秘访客的失真图像吗
<36-11,RYAN>of Shaw's mystery visitor at the psychiatric facility?

847
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:22,310
<36-11,RYAN>维克拉姆把它复原了
<36-11,RYAN>Well, Vikram was able to clean it up.

848
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,820
<36-12,ESPOSITO>他说自己不相信宗教
<36-12,ESPOSITO>He said he didn't believe in all this religious stuff.

849
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:29,400
<36-13,CASTLE>他在说谎  你们都知道这说明什么
<36-13,CASTLE>He lied, and you all know what that means.

850
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,500
<36-14,ALEXIS>说明他疯了吗
<36-14,ALEXIS>That he's insane.

851
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:33,070
<36-15,CASTLE>不  不像肖  他的神志很清醒
<36-15,CASTLE>No, unlike Shaw, he has all his faculties,

852
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:36,740
<36-15,CASTLE>但是奥斯卡和他的先父一样是虔诚的信徒
<36-15,CASTLE>but Oscar, like his father before him, is a true believer.

853
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:38,970
<36-15,CASTLE>他要继承先父的未完事业
<36-15,CASTLE>He's gonna pick up where his old man left off --

<39-3,ESPOSITO>他们就没把肖管好
<39-3,ESPOSITO>They didn't do so great with Shaw.

920
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,210
<39-4,RYAN>老大

<40-2,CASTLE>我身上还有死亡标记
<40-2,CASTLE>I'm... still marked for death.

00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:36,770
<40-3,BECKETT>按说救了反基督者的命
<40-3,BECKETT>Oh, well, you'd think that saving the Antichrist

925
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:37,910
<40-3,BECKETT>真的能让你逃过一劫呢
<40-3,BECKETT>would actually give you a pass.

926
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:39,710
<40-4,CASTLE>你就笑话我吧  我要是死了你会想我的
<40-4,CASTLE>You know, you mock, but you're gonna miss me when I'm gone.

927
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:41,130
<40-5,BECKETT>你死不了
<40-5,BECKETT>You're not going anywhere.
