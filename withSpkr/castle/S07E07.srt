4
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,830
<1-3,EMT>没有  但她曾说是有人害了她

<2-1,RICHARD CASTLE>他曾写"星辰不是..."
<2-1,RICHARD CASTLE>who wrote, "It's not in the stars..."

57
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,020
<2-30,BECKETT>有凶杀案
<2-30,BECKETT>There's been a murder.

<2-31,ESPOSITO>是吗  我们没接到通知啊

62
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,730
<3-1,CASTLE>本可能更糟的
<3-1,CASTLE>Well, it could have been worse.

63
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:04,630
<3-2,BECKETT>还是可能更糟啊
<3-2,BECKETT>It still might be.

64
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:07,040
<3-2,BECKETT>谁知道他们现在在怎么折腾我们家啊
<3-2,BECKETT>I mean, who knows what they're doing to our place right now?

65
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:08,340
<3-3,CASTLE>你听到你说什么了吗
<3-3,CASTLE>You hear what you just said?

66
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,540
<3-4,BECKETT>"我们家"  我们诶  我们结婚了
<3-4,BECKETT>"Our place." Our. We're married.

67
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:12,850
<3-5,CASTLE>我们结婚了  我们成功了  卡塞尔太太
<3-5,CASTLE>We're married. We did it, Mrs. Castle!

68
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,720
<3-6,BECKETT>是啊  贝克特先生
<3-6,BECKETT>We certainly did, Mr. Beckett.

69
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,730
<3-6,BECKETT>不过这可不是
<3-6,BECKETT>Although this arguably isn't

70
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:17,870
<3-6,BECKETT>最浪漫的婚后活动
<3-6,BECKETT>the most romantic post-wedding activity.

71
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:20,090
<3-7,CASTLE>或许也很合适  考虑到我们是怎么认识的
<3-7,CASTLE>Or perhaps it's fitting, considering how we met.

72
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:23,180
<3-7,CASTLE>但你说得对  得考虑蜜月了
<3-7,CASTLE>But you bring up an excellent point... the honeymoon.

73
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,850
<3-8,BECKETT>是啊  关于去异国岛屿度假
<3-8,BECKETT>Yes. About the exotic island getaway...

74
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,100
<3-8,BECKETT>那个得等等了
<3-8,BECKETT>I-it's gonna have to wait.

75
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,870
<3-10,BECKETT>-为什么  -因为你失踪的时候
<3-10,BECKETT>- Why? - Because when you went missing,

76
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:32,730
<3-10,BECKETT>我把我的假期都用来找你了
<3-10,BECKETT>I used up all of my vacation days looking for you.

77
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,080
<3-11,CASTLE>那没有蜜月了
<3-11,CASTLE>So no honeymoon.

78
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,590
<3-12,BECKETT>一段日子内是不行了
<3-12,BECKETT>Mm, not for a while, I'm afraid.

79
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,460
<3-13,CASTLE>没有迈代鸡尾酒  我们只有杀人案
<3-13,CASTLE>So instead of Mai Tais... we get murder.

80
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:42,930
<3-14,CASTLE>好啊
<3-14,CASTLE>Great.

81
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:44,440
<3-14,CASTLE>这挺好的
<3-14,CASTLE>Nah, it'll be great.

82
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:46,800
<4-1,DOCTOR>惠特妮·威廉姆斯
<4-1,DOCTOR>Whitney Williams.

83
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:48,890
<4-1,DOCTOR>先是抽搐  随后心脏停搏
<4-1,DOCTOR>She went into convulsions, then cardiac arrest.

84
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:49,930
<4-1,DOCTOR>我们没能救活她
<4-1,DOCTOR>We couldn't bring her back.

85
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,710
<4-2,CASTLE>她的遗言是德蒙贝克
<4-2,CASTLE>And her last words were "Diamondback"?

86
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,310
<4-3,DOCTOR>-那是什么  -不知道
<4-3,DOCTOR>- What does that mean? - I have no idea.

87
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,380
<4-4,BECKETT>她自称是被人谋害
<4-4,BECKETT>And she believed that she was a victim of foul play.

88
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,700
<4-5,DOCTOR>是的  我也这么认为
<4-5,DOCTOR>Yes, and so do I.

89
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,010
<4-5,DOCTOR>我们进行了血检
<4-5,DOCTOR>We ran a full blood work-up,

90
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:00,290
<4-5,DOCTOR>检测到了高剂量的地高辛
<4-5,DOCTOR>and it came back with high traces of digoxin.

91
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,770
<4-6,CASTLE>那是心脏药物
<4-6,CASTLE>Oh, that's a heart medication.

92
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:03,270
<4-7,DOCTOR>从毛地黄中萃取的
<4-7,DOCTOR>Derived from the foxglove plant.

93
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,830
<4-7,DOCTOR>据我们的尸检官称
<4-7,DOCTOR>According to our pathologist,

94
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:08,420
<4-7,DOCTOR>这是未提纯的地高辛  直接从植物中提取的
<4-7,DOCTOR>this was un-purified digoxin, taken directly from the plant.

95
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,800
<4-8,BECKETT>-是致命剂量  -她是被毒死的
<4-8,BECKETT>- It's lethal. - So she was poisoned.

96
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,980
<4-8,BECKETT>能知道她摄入毛地黄有多久了吗
<4-8,BECKETT>A-any way to tell how long ago she ingested the foxglove?

97
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,100
<4-9,DOCTOR>我们估计为10到14小时
<4-9,DOCTOR>We're estimating 10 to 14 hours.

98
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,900
<4-10,BECKETT>你联系她亲属了吗
<4-10,BECKETT>Have you contacted the next of kin?

99
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,520
<4-11,DOCTOR>我觉得你们会想来处理这事
<4-11,DOCTOR>I thought you would want to handle that.

100
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,510
<4-11,DOCTOR>这是她的紧急情况卡
<4-11,DOCTOR>This is her in-case-of-emergency card.

102
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,090
<5-1,ESPOSITO>多谢前来达格玛先生和太太

<5-5,PHILIP>send them to the finest schools.

109
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:40,340
<5-6,RYAN>下毒是在10到14小时之前
<5-6,RYAN>The poisoning occurred between 10 and 14 hours ago.

110
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,170
<5-6,RYAN>你们知道惠特妮当时在哪里
<5-6,RYAN>Do you happen to know where Whitney was

111
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:43,940

<5-6,RYAN>不知道
<5-6,RYAN>No.

113

<5-7,LENANNE>我们最后一次见她是一周前
<5-7,LENANNE>The last time we saw her was a week ago

114
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:48,780
<5-7,LENANNE>她来吃晚饭
<5-7,LENANNE>when she came over for supper.

115
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:51,690
<5-8,RYAN>她提到她跟谁有矛盾了吗
<5-8,RYAN>Did she mention if she was having problems with anyone,

116
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,730
<5-8,RYAN>也许在工作上
<5-8,RYAN>Perhaps at work?

117
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:53,920
<5-9,LENANNE>她说过要休息下
<5-9,LENANNE>She did say she was going to

<5-11,LENANNE>Whitney said she needed some time to get over the loss.

<5-12,ESPOSITO>德蒙贝克这词  你们听过吗
<5-12,ESPOSITO>Does the word "Diamondback" mean anything to either of you?

122
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,470
<5-12,ESPOSITO>-没有  -我想没有
<5-12,ESPOSITO>- No. - No, I'm afraid not.

123
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:10,070
<6-1,CASTLE>德蒙贝克
<6-1,CASTLE>Okay. "Diamondback."

124
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:11,110
<6-1,CASTLE>反复斟酌后
<6-1,CASTLE>I've whittled it down to

125
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:12,970
<6-1,CASTLE>我猜测德蒙贝克可能有三种含义
<6-1,CASTLE>three possibilities as to what that means

126
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:15,040
<6-1,CASTLE>同时能够解释为何惠特妮死前会说这个
<6-1,CASTLE>and why Whitney would utter it with her dying breath.

127
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:18,370
<6-2,BECKETT>我相信每一种都很有说服力
<6-2,BECKETT>And I'm sure that none of them will be a waste of my time.

128
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:20,530
<6-3,CASTLE>可能性一  它是一个地下
<6-3,CASTLE>Possibility number one -- it's the password

129
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:24,190
<6-3,CASTLE>格斗俱乐部的暗号
<6-3,CASTLE>for a murderous underground snake-handling fight club.

130
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,500
<6-3,CASTLE>诚然  也许不是这个意思
<6-3,CASTLE>Granted, that's probably not what it means,

131
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,230
<6-3,CASTLE>但这可能成为我妮基·希特系列下本书的创意
<6-3,CASTLE>but it might be the basis for my next Nikki Heat novel.

132
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:31,250
<6-3,CASTLE>可能性二  她是被
<6-3,CASTLE>Possibility number two -- she was killed

133
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,860
<6-3,CASTLE>漫威漫画人物杀害  其特殊能力
<6-3,CASTLE>by the marvel character diamondback, whose special skill

134
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:37,110
<6-3,CASTLE>是投射菱形毒刺
<6-3,CASTLE>was throwing diamond-shaped spikes filled with poison.

135
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,630
<6-4,CASTLE>可能性三
<6-4,CASTLE>Third possibility

136
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,360
<6-5,ESPOSITO>是亚利桑那州一家度假农场
<6-5,ESPOSITO>It's a dude ranch in Arizona.

137
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,860
<6-6,RYAN>达格玛夫妇那里毫无结果  但我们找到一封
<6-6,RYAN>We struck out with the Dagmars, but we found an e-mail

138
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:46,140
<6-6,RYAN>发自德蒙贝克老西部度假村的住宿确认邮件
<6-6,RYAN>to Whitney from a diamondback old west ranch

139
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,840
<6-6,RYAN>惠特妮在牧场工人宿舍14号房定了2周住宿
<6-6,RYAN>confirming a two-week stay in bunkhouse number 14.

140
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,950
<6-7,CASTLE>老西部农场度假村  这就是我说的可能性三
<6-7,CASTLE>Old west dude ranch. That's my number three.

141
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,990
<6-7,CASTLE>我刚要说呢  干得好  兄弟们
<6-7,CASTLE>That's exactly what I was gonna say. Good work, boys.

142
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:55,830
<6-8,ESPOSITO>你还是逊毙了
<6-8,ESPOSITO>You still suck.

143
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:58,090
<6-9,RYAN>你还欠我们伴郎服的租赁费呢
<6-9,RYAN>And you owe us for those tuxedo rentals.

144
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,350
<6-11,BECKETT>她去亚利桑那度了两周假
<6-11,BECKETT>So, she was on vacation in Arizona for two weeks?

145
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:02,910
<6-12,ESPOSITO>-是的  -有人和她一起吗
<6-12,ESPOSITO>- Yep.  - She go with anyone?

146
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:07,040
<6-14,RYAN>没有  但这种城市人乡村体验的事情
<6-14,RYAN>No, but it looks like the whole "City slickers" cowboy thing

147
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,390
<6-14,RYAN>显然不太适合她
<6-14,RYAN>didn't really agree with her.

148
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:09,400
<6-14,RYAN>惠特妮缩减了她的行程
<6-14,RYAN>Whitney cut her trip short.

149
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,850
<6-14,RYAN>只在那待了三天
<6-14,RYAN>After only three days there,

150
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:12,450
<6-14,RYAN>她就把机票改签了
<6-14,RYAN>she paid for a last-minute ticket change

151
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,430
<6-14,RYAN>于今早8点飞往菲尼克斯
<6-14,RYAN>from 8. a.m flight out of Phoenix this morning.

152
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:17,640
<6-15,BECKETT>今早  所以她是在亚利桑那当地时间
<6-15,BECKETT>This morning? So she was poisoned in Arizona

153
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:22,710
<6-15,BECKETT>凌晨1点至5点间被下毒的
<6-15,BECKETT>somewhere between 1:00 to 5:00 a.m. local time.

154
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:25,070
<6-16,ESPOSITO>所有证据显示她离开的很匆忙
<6-16,ESPOSITO>And all indications are that she left in a big hurry.

155
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:27,820
<6-16,ESPOSITO>她甚至忘了归还宿舍的钥匙
<6-16,ESPOSITO>She even forgot to turn in her bunkhouse key.

156
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,790
<6-17,BECKETT>我需要那个地方所有的资料
<6-17,BECKETT>Okay, I need every detail we can get on that place.

157
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:30,380
<6-18,CASTLE>据网上说
<6-18,CASTLE>Well, according to this,

158
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:33,160
<6-18,CASTLE>德蒙贝克老西部农场是一个充满历史感的度假胜地
<6-18,CASTLE>"Diamondback old west ranch is a living history resort

159
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:36,120
<6-18,CASTLE>服务员和客人均着老式的西部服装
<6-18,CASTLE>"Where both staff and guests dress in old west attire

160
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,200
<6-18,CASTLE>体验牛仔的生活
<6-18,CASTLE>and engage in cowboy activities."

161
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,230
<6-18,CASTLE>听起来很不错
<6-18,CASTLE>This sounds pretty cool!

162
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,160
<6-19,BECKETT>不  你想想惠特妮是在那里被毒死的
<6-19,BECKETT>Or not, considering Whitney might have been poisoned there.

163
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:45,710
<6-19,BECKETT>等等  如果惠特妮是今日乘机返回的话
<6-19,BECKETT>Wait a minute -- if Whitney flew back today,

164
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:47,910
<6-19,BECKETT>那她毒发的时候应该坐在
<6-19,BECKETT>then she was coming in on the train from JFK

165
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:48,830
<6-19,BECKETT>从肯尼迪机场出发的地铁上
<6-19,BECKETT>when she had that seizure.

166
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:51,750
<6-19,BECKETT>在医院我们只找到了她的钱包
<6-19,BECKETT>But the only personal effect that we found at the hospital

167
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:54,200
<6-19,BECKETT>所以她的行李去哪了
<6-19,BECKETT>was her purse, so where is her luggage?

168
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,560
<6-20,ESPOSITO>也许救护队带走她时  落在地铁上了
<6-20,ESPOSITO>Maybe it was left in the subway when the medics took her.

169
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,350
<6-21,BECKETT>如果是在农场被下毒的
<6-21,BECKETT>Well, if something happened at that ranch,

170
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:00,770
<6-21,BECKETT>那她的行李里也许会留下证据
<6-21,BECKETT>there might be evidence of it in her suitcases.

171
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:02,720
<6-22,ESPOSITO>-我会去查的   -我去查查她的账单
<6-22,ESPOSITO>- I'll look into it.  - And I'll keep digging in her financials.

172
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,180
<6-23,RYAN>也许在亚利桑那她还去过别的地方
<6-23,RYAN>Maybe there's somewhere else she went in Arizona.

173
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,680
<6-24,BECKETT>我会联系当地的治安官
<6-24,BECKETT>And I'll touch base with the local sheriff

174
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,600
<6-24,BECKETT>-寻求合作调查  -谢了  伙计
<6-24,BECKETT>- and coordinate with him on the investigation. - Thanks, big boy.

175
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,620
<7-1,SHERIFF>警探  在我看来
<7-1,SHERIFF>Look, detective the way I see it,

176
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,220
<7-1,SHERIFF>这事不在亚利桑那的管辖范围
<7-1,SHERIFF>This is not an Arizona matter.

177
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,640
<7-2,BECKETT>治安官  我们有证据
<7-2,BECKETT>Sheriff, we have evidence

178
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,330
<7-2,BECKETT>证明惠特妮是在你的管辖区内被下毒的
<7-2,BECKETT>that Whitney was poisoned in your jurisdiction.

179
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:19,750
<7-3,SHERIFF>不  你只是猜测罢了
<7-3,SHERIFF>No, what you have is speculation.

180
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,940
<7-3,SHERIFF>她可能是在飞机上或者机场被下毒的
<7-3,SHERIFF>She could have been poisoned on the plane or at the airport.

181
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,410
<7-3,SHERIFF>而且我也不知道从哪开始调查
<7-3,SHERIFF>Hell, I wouldn't know where to begin.

182
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:26,360
<7-4,BECKETT>我来告诉你
<7-4,BECKETT>Well, I-I'm telling you where to begin --

183
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:28,180
<7-4,BECKETT>德蒙贝克老西部农场
<7-4,BECKETT>Diamondback old west ranch.

184
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:31,490
<7-5,SHERIFF>警探  你要明白  那个度假村
<7-5,SHERIFF>Detective, you got to understand. That resort --

185
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,730
<7-5,SHERIFF>可是我们旅游小镇的命根子
<7-5,SHERIFF>That's the lifeblood of our little tourist town.

186
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:37,110
<7-6,BECKETT>-所以这涉及到政治了  -不  是私人感情
<7-6,BECKETT>- So this is political.  - No, it's personal.

187
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,960
<7-7,SHERIFF>听着  这里有我一起长大的朋友
<7-7,SHERIFF>Look, I've got people here -- folks I grew up with --

188
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,150
<7-7,SHERIFF>我不能平白无故地打扰人家的生意
<7-7,SHERIFF>and I can't justo in and disrupt business

189
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,880
<7-7,SHERIFF>除非你有确实的证据
<7-7,SHERIFF>until there's some concrete proof.

190
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,040
<8-1,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>非常遗憾  没有当地治安官的合作
<8-1,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>I'm sorry. Without the sheriff's cooperation,

191
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,450
<8-1,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>我们能做的十分有限
<8-1,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>there's only so much we can do.

192
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,390
<8-2,BECKETT>所以我们就让凶手逍遥法外了吗
<8-2,BECKETT>So we're just gonna let him get away with this?

193
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,710
<8-3,ESPOSITO>就像我们不计较
<8-3,ESPOSITO>Kind of like how we let you get away

194
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:56,460
<8-3,ESPOSITO>你们不请我们去婚礼一样
<8-3,ESPOSITO>with not inviting us to the wedding?

195
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,410
<8-4,GATES>至少你们被邀去祝酒了
<8-4,GATES>Well, at least you were invited to the champagne toast.

196
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:00,790
<8-5,BECKETT>抱歉  长官
<8-5,BECKETT>Uh... sorry, sir.

197
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:03,370
<8-6,GATES>不不  我确定这是卡塞尔先生的错
<8-6,GATES>Oh, no, no, no. I'm sure it was Mr. Castle's fault.

198
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:05,540
<8-6,GATES>关于案子  我联络联邦局
<8-6,GATES>Now, regarding the case, I'll call the feds

199
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,400
<8-6,GATES>看他们能否为我们说说情
<8-6,GATES>and see if they can intercede on our behalf.

200
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,750
<8-7,BECKETT>长官  那可得好几周呢
<8-7,BECKETT>Sir, that could take weeks.

201
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,660
<8-7,BECKETT>到那时什么证据证人都没了
<8-7,BECKETT>By then, any evidence or witnesses could be long gone.

202
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:15,130
<8-8,RYAN>长官  我查了惠特妮的消费记录
<8-8,RYAN>Uh, excuse me, sir, I checked Whitney's financials.

203
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:16,450
<8-8,RYAN>她今早叫了的士
<8-8,RYAN>She used a car service

204
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:18,780
<8-8,RYAN>送她去亚利桑那的机场
<8-8,RYAN>to get to the airport in Arizona this morning.

205
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:19,870
<8-8,RYAN>我跟司机谈过了
<8-8,RYAN>And I spoke with the driver.

206
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:22,220
<8-8,RYAN>他说她离开农场时心情很沮丧
<8-8,RYAN>He said she seemed upset when she left the ranch.

207
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,500
<8-9,ESPOSITO>肯定发生了什么
<8-9,ESPOSITO>Something happened there.

208
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,500
<8-10,RYAN>对  但我们没办法调查
<8-10,RYAN>Yeah, but we have no way to investigate it.

209
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,490
<8-11,CASTLE>等等
<8-11,CASTLE>Wait.

210
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:28,870
<8-11,CASTLE>也许我们可以
<8-11,CASTLE>Maybe we do.

211
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,000
<8-12,BECKETT>-可以吗  -看看这地方
<8-12,BECKETT>- We do?  - Well, look at this place.

212
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:34,140
<8-13,CASTLE>多美的天际啊
<8-13,CASTLE>I mean, it's got beautiful skies,

213
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:37,180
<8-13,CASTLE>一望无际的草场  老西部的刺激
<8-13,CASTLE>Wide-open spaces, the thrill of the old west.

214
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:40,360
<8-13,CASTLE>作为即兴蜜月行  有什么比这度假村更好的呢
<8-13,CASTLE>What better place for an impromptu honeymoon?

215
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:43,140
<8-13,CASTLE>当然  主要还是去调查案子
<8-13,CASTLE>For the investigation, of course.

216
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:45,260
<8-13,CASTLE>我们乘机几小时就可以到那里了
<8-13,CASTLE>We could jump on a plane and be there in a few hours.

217
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,570
<8-14,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你不会说真的吧
<8-14,BECKETT>Castle, you cannot be serious.

218
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:49,400
<8-15,CASTLE>我们一边度蜜月
<8-15,CASTLE>We can find Whitney's killer

219
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,190
<8-15,CASTLE>一边调查案子找出真凶  太完美了
<8-15,CASTLE>and have a honeymoon at the same time -- it's perfect.

220
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:55,600
<8-16,BECKETT>不  卡塞尔  我才不要去农场度蜜月呢
<8-16,BECKETT>No, Castle. We are not having a honeymoon at a dude ranch!

221
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,830
<8-17,CASTLE>这可是绝佳的掩护
<8-17,CASTLE>Well, it -- then, it can be our cover story.

222
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:58,840
<8-17,CASTLE>我们是一对渴望体验
<8-17,CASTLE>We're a-a newlywed couple

223
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,050
<8-17,CASTLE>狂野西部的新婚夫妇
<8-17,CASTLE>with a hankerin' for the wild frontier, right?

224
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:03,110
<8-17,CASTLE>听着  贝克特
<8-17,CASTLE>And, look, Beckett,

225
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,260
<8-17,CASTLE>我知道你想将
<8-17,CASTLE>I know you want to see justice brought

226
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,370
<8-17,CASTLE>凶手绳之以法
<8-17,CASTLE>to this young woman's killer.

227
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:08,390
<8-17,CASTLE>而这个
<8-17,CASTLE>And this...

228
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:11,080
<8-17,CASTLE>这是唯一的办法
<8-17,CASTLE>This is the only way.

229
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:18,730
<8-18,GATES>虽然不想承认  但也许你老公说的对
<8-18,GATES>I hate to say this, but your husband may be right.

230
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:22,200
<8-18,GATES>这可能是破案的最佳机会
<8-18,GATES>This could be our best shot at solving the case.

00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,510
<11-16,BECKETT>这房间之前住过位女士吗
<11-16,BECKETT>that there was a woman staying in our room before?

344
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,170
<11-16,BECKETT>是啊

345
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:32,630
<11-17,CASTLE>他们居然让她和男人住得这么近
<11-17,CASTLE>I'm surprised they let her stay in so close with menfolk,

346
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:34,180
<11-17,CASTLE>考虑到这里的老西部风俗
<11-17,CASTLE>considering the customs of the old west.

347
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,420
<11-18,TOBIAS>我猜  当他们发现

353
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:46,760
<12-1,TOBIAS>强壮  肤黑  味苦
<12-1,TOBIAS>strong, black, and bitter.

354
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:49,510
<12-2,BECKETT>你真有趣  我猜你和你之前的邻居
<12-2,BECKETT>Ooh, you're fun! I bet you and your old bunkhouse mate

355
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:50,920
<12-2,BECKETT>一定遇到过不少麻烦事
<12-2,BECKETT>got into all sorts of trouble.

356
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,010
<12-3,TOBIAS>我可没有  不过惠特妮可不一样
<12-3,TOBIAS>Not me. But Whitney, on the other hand --

357
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:55,020
<12-3,TOBIAS>别误会我  她是个可人儿
<12-3,TOBIAS>Now, don't get me wrong. She's a sweetheart,

358
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,770
<12-3,TOBIAS>但她可不是个省油的灯
<12-3,TOBIAS>but she's a bit of a hell raiser.

359
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:57,990
<12-4,BECKETT>-是吗  -是的
<12-4,BECKETT>- Really? - Yeah.

360
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,260
<12-6,BECKETT>-怎么说  -我们来这里的第一天
<12-6,BECKETT>- How so? - Okay, like, our first day here,

361
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,110
<12-7,TOBIAS>我们去看一场马术表演
<12-7,TOBIAS>we went on a horseback-riding tour.

362
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:03,570
<12-7,TOBIAS>她中途偷偷溜走了
<12-7,TOBIAS>She snuck off in the middle of it.

363
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:04,710
<12-8,CASTLE>真离谱  她去哪了
<12-8,CASTLE>Get out. Where'd she go?

364
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,680
<12-9,TOBIAS>大概是去跟她那个牛仔员工鬼混去了吧
<12-9,TOBIAS>Probably went to go hang out with her ranch hand --

365
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,840
<12-9,TOBIAS>在这里工作的红巾男孩中的一个
<12-9,TOBIAS>One of the red-bandana boys that work here.

366
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,620
<12-9,TOBIAS>她会整晚和他在一起  每天如此
<12-9,TOBIAS>She used to stay out with him all night, every night.

367
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,460
<12-10,CASTLE>听起来我最好让他离我夫人远一点
<12-10,CASTLE>Sounds like I better keep him clear of my missus.

368
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,700
<12-10,CASTLE>-这个罗密欧是谁  -我不知道  她不肯说
<12-10,CASTLE>- Who was this Romeo? - I don't know. She wouldn't say.

369
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:18,230
<12-11,TOBIAS>她只说他很高很帅  黑皮肤
<12-11,TOBIAS>She just said he was tall, dark, and handsome...

370
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:18,980
<12-11,TOBIAS>而且有老婆
<12-11,TOBIAS>oh, and married.

371
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,570
<12-12,BECKETT>有老婆吗  真离谱
<12-12,BECKETT>Married?! Get out.

372
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,520
<12-13,TOBIAS>-没错  -不知道是不是出了什么麻烦
<12-13,TOBIAS>- Yes. - Ooh, I wonder if there was any trouble.

373
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,070
<12-14,BECKETT>我们能住进这间屋子好像是
<12-14,BECKETT>I kind of think the reason that we got this room

374
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,740
<12-14,BECKETT>因为惠特妮提前离开了
<12-14,BECKETT>is because Whitney left so early.

375
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,670
<12-15,TOBIAS>没错  昨天晚上
<12-15,TOBIAS>She sure did -- her last night here,

376
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:30,030
<12-15,TOBIAS>她凌晨三点才回来  心烦意乱的
<12-15,TOBIAS>she rolled in at 3:00 A.M., upset.

377
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,270
<12-15,TOBIAS>-她的哭声把我吵醒了  -发生什么事了
<12-15,TOBIAS>- She woke me up with all her crying. - What happened?

378
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:34,440
<12-17,TOBIAS>我也这样问她  可她不肯说
<12-17,TOBIAS>That's what I said, but she didn't want to talk about it.

379
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,860
<12-17,TOBIAS>天亮前她就离开了  连再见都没跟我说
<12-17,TOBIAS>She left before the sun came up. Didn't even say goodbye.

380
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:39,060
<12-17,TOBIAS>我约会要迟到了
<12-17,TOBIAS>Oh. I'm late for chow.

381
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,670
<12-17,TOBIAS>谢谢你们的咖啡  回头见
<12-17,TOBIAS>Thanks for the coffee. See y'all around.

382
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:41,650
<12-18,BECKETT>好吧
<12-18,BECKETT>Okay.

383
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,880
<12-19,CASTLE>跟已婚男人的婚外情
<12-19,CASTLE>An affair with a married man?

384
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:49,300
<12-20,BECKETT>是的  凌晨三点之前她都跟他在一起
<12-20,BECKETT>Yes, and she was with him until 3:00 A.M.

385
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,440
<12-20,BECKETT>这正好是她被下毒的那段时间
<12-20,BECKETT>that's right in the middle of her time-of-poisoning window.

386
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,470
<12-21,CASTLE>-得找出这个人  -怎么找  我们是卧底
<12-21,CASTLE>- We got to find this guy. - But how? We're undercover.

387
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:55,460
<12-22,BECKETT>我不能就那么亮出警徽直接问别人
<12-22,BECKETT>I can't just flash my badge and get people to talk.

388
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:58,190
<12-23,CASTLE>没错  所以这次我们不能用警察的身份
<12-23,CASTLE>Exactly, which is why we don't approach this like cops.

389
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:00,310
<12-23,CASTLE>我们用作家的身份来打探消息
<12-23,CASTLE>We approach this like writers.

390
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:02,430
<12-24,BECKETT>我们拖到最后  然后编故事吗
<12-24,BECKETT>So we procrastinate and make stuff up?

391
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:03,480
<12-24,BECKETT>不是
<12-24,BECKETT>No.

392
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:05,060
<12-25,CASTLE>是  但也不是
<12-25,CASTLE>Well, yes. But no.

393
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,480
<12-25,CASTLE>在这个事情上
<12-25,CASTLE>In this particular instance,

394
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:08,770
<12-25,CASTLE>我们要像作家一样调查  那就是...
<12-25,CASTLE>we approach the investigation like writers by...

395
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,240
<12-25,CASTLE>做调研
<12-25,CASTLE>doing research.

396
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:14,190
<13-1,CASTLE>有七个牛仔员工符合
<13-1,CASTLE>Now, there are seven ranch hands who fit the bill

397
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:15,990
<13-1,CASTLE>高帅且黑的描述  但是为了找出
<13-1,CASTLE>of tall, dark, and handsome, but in order to figure out

398
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:17,160
<13-1,CASTLE>到底是哪个在跟惠特妮鬼混
<13-1,CASTLE>which one was fooling around with Whitney,

399
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,120
<13-1,CASTLE>我们必须先找出其中哪一个是已婚的
<13-1,CASTLE>we have to first determine who of them are married.

400
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,090
<13-1,CASTLE>所以我们找一下谁戴了婚戒
<13-1,CASTLE>That means we need to go on a wedding-ring search.

402
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,140
<13-1,CASTLE>这几个是可疑人物
<13-1,CASTLE>And these are the possibilities.

403
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,380
<13-2,CASTLE>我做了一下分工
<13-2,CASTLE>So I split their classes up between us.

404
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:27,910
<13-3,BECKETT>等一下
<13-3,BECKETT>Whoa. Hold up.

405
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:30,220
<13-3,BECKETT>口琴初学班  牛仔酒吧
<13-3,BECKETT>Harmonica for beginners? Cowboy saloon?

406
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,790
<13-3,BECKETT>为什么你分到的都是好地方
<13-3,BECKETT>How come you get all the cool activities,

407
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:34,590
<13-4,CASTLE>-而我分到的却是捆猪班  -因为是我的主意
<13-4,CASTLE>- and I get hog-tying? - Because this was my idea.

408
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:35,760
<13-4,CASTLE>尽管很可惜
<13-4,CASTLE>Though it will be a shame

409
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,820
<13-4,CASTLE>我们蜜月的第一天要分头行动了
<13-4,CASTLE>that we're spending the first day of our honeymoon apart.

410
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,680
<13-5,BECKETT>不可惜  因为这不是我们的蜜月旅行
<13-5,BECKETT>Except we're not, because this is not our honeymoon.

411
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:42,160
<13-5,BECKETT>好了  回见
<13-5,BECKETT>Okay. Bye.

412
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,120
<13-5,BECKETT>注意安全
<13-5,BECKETT>Be safe.

413
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:45,800
<13-6,BECKETT>莱恩  情况怎么样
<13-6,BECKETT>Hey, Ryan, how's it going?

414
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,280
<13-7,RYAN>很好  我们刚讨论过你们的婚礼
<13-7,RYAN>Oh, wonderful. In fact, we were just discussing your nuptials.

415
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,500
<13-8,ESPOSITO>不是实际的那场  因为我们都没参加
<13-8,ESPOSITO>Not the actual event, since neither of us were there.

416
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,820
<13-9,BECKETT>伙计们  你们就为了这事打电话吗
<13-9,BECKETT>Guys, is this really why you're calling?

417
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:53,970
<13-10,RYAN>一部分原因是的
<13-10,RYAN>Partly, yes.

418
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,710
<13-11,ESPOSITO>我们有新消息  先说好的
<13-11,ESPOSITO>And we have news. Here's the good.

419
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:57,840
<13-11,ESPOSITO>交通运输局监控显示惠特妮的包
<13-11,ESPOSITO>MTA cameras show that Whitney's bags

420
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,900
<13-11,ESPOSITO>的确遗落在了地铁站
<13-11,ESPOSITO>were left on the subway.

421
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,140
<13-12,RYAN>坏消息是  包被一个流浪汉偷走了
<13-12,RYAN>Here's the bad news -- they were stolen by a homeless man.

422
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,160
<13-12,RYAN>不过我们发了全境通告
<13-12,RYAN>But we put out a BOLO.

423
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,560
<13-12,RYAN>希望有人会认出他来
<13-12,RYAN>Hopefully somebody will recognize him.

424
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,560
<13-13,ESPOSITO>另外  蕾妮在尸检中也有所发现
<13-13,ESPOSITO>Also, Lanie found something during her autopsy.

425
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,800
<13-13,ESPOSITO>她在惠特妮的指甲里
<13-13,ESPOSITO>She found traces of a wax-covered cardboard

426
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,330
<13-13,ESPOSITO>和裤腰带中  发现了涂了蜡的纸屑
<13-13,ESPOSITO>under Whitney's nails and on the waistband of her pants.

427
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:13,360
<13-14,BECKETT>蜡纸屑  像包肉的那种纸吗
<13-14,BECKETT>Wax-covered cardboard -- like butcher paper?

428
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,730
<13-15,ESPOSITO>蕾妮说很难分辨
<13-15,ESPOSITO>Lanie says it's too hard to tell.

429
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:16,960
<13-15,ESPOSITO>你和跟屁虫那边怎么样  有发现吗
<13-15,ESPOSITO>What about you and hop along? Learn anything?

430
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,370
<13-16,BECKETT>目前看来  我们的死者
<13-16,BECKETT>Uh, well, so far, it looks like our victim

431
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:20,430
<13-16,BECKETT>在和一个已婚男人有婚外情
<13-16,BECKETT>was having an affair with a married man.

432
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:23,150
<13-16,BECKETT>不过问题是  男人的身份还是个谜
<13-16,BECKETT>But the problem is, his identity is a mystery.

433
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:25,760
<13-17,RYAN>说到谜  我们跟惠特妮的朋友谈过
<13-17,RYAN>Well, speaking of mysteries, we spoke with Whitney's friends.

434
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,080
<13-17,RYAN>他们说在她出发之前
<13-17,RYAN>They said prior to her departure,

435
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,740
<13-17,RYAN>她花了很长时间待在历史协会
<13-17,RYAN>she was spending a good deal of time at the historical society.

436
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,050
<13-18,BECKETT>他们知道她在那里干什么吗
<13-18,BECKETT>Do they know what she was doing there?

437
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:33,560
<13-19,RYAN>我们还在调查  但是
<13-19,RYAN>Well, we're still looking into it, but --

438
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,950
<13-20,BECKETT>好了  我要挂了
<13-20,BECKETT>Okay, guys, I-I-I got to go.

439
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:37,690
<13-21,TOBIAS>凯特  你是要去捆猪班吗
<13-21,TOBIAS>Hey, Kate. Wait, are you going to hog-tying class?

00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,110
<15-11,OLLIE>差点就丢了工作
<15-11,OLLIE>That could have cost me my job.

00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:43,780
<15-11,OLLIE>先生  我很抱歉
<15-11,OLLIE>Look, mister, I'm sorry.

<15-12,CASTLE>Save it. You want my silence?

498
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:48,990
<15-12,CASTLE>那就跟我讲讲惠特妮  你们俩怎么回事
<15-12,CASTLE>Tell me about Whitney. What happened between you two?

499
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,590
<15-13,OLLIE>是她找上我的
<15-13,OLLIE>Look, she came on to me,

500
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,870
<15-13,OLLIE>跟我调情  动手动脚的
<15-13,OLLIE>started flirting, getting all handsy.

501
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:55,190
<15-13,OLLIE>几个哥们儿见了  就说我们好上了
<15-13,OLLIE>A bunch of the boys saw us and figured we hooked up,

502
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:58,010
<15-13,OLLIE>但我们没有  我发誓
<15-13,OLLIE>but we didn't -- I swear it.

503
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:00,280
<15-13,OLLIE>事实上  我觉得她就是想要我的农场钥匙
<15-13,OLLIE>In fact, I think she was just after my ranch key.

504
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,170
<15-14,CASTLE>农场钥匙
<15-14,CASTLE>Ranch key?

505
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:03,440
<15-15,OLLIE>挂在一个蛇形钥匙链上
<15-15,OLLIE>It's on a snake key chain.

506
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:06,170
<15-15,OLLIE>我认为是她拉扯我的时候偷走了
<15-15,OLLIE>I think she picked it off me when she was pawing at me.

507
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:08,290
<15-16,CASTLE>-哪里的钥匙  -农场仓库
<15-16,CASTLE>- What does the key open? - The ranch shed.

508
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,980
<15-17,OLLIE>等等  你是说她偷了你的钥匙
<15-17,OLLIE>Wait a minute. Y-you're saying that she stole your key

509
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,330
<15-18,CASTLE>就为了进农场仓库
<15-18,CASTLE>to open the ranch shed.

510
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:13,330
<15-18,CASTLE>仓库里有什么
<15-18,CASTLE>What's in the shed?

511
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:15,590
<15-19,OLLIE>没什么  就是些农用工具
<15-19,OLLIE>Nothing. Just ranch supplies.

512
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,080
<15-19,OLLIE>我不明白
<15-19,OLLIE>I don't get it.

513
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,320
<16-1,CASTLE>惠特妮为什么要偷这里的钥匙呢
<16-1,CASTLE>Why would Whitney steal the key to this place?

514
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,840
<16-2,BECKETT>不知道  但显然这和外遇无关
<16-2,BECKETT>I don't know. But clearly, it has nothing to do with the affair.

515
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:35,440
<16-3,CASTLE>那她到底在找什么
<16-3,CASTLE>Right, so what was she after?

516
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,840
<16-4,BECKETT>卡塞尔  还记得蕾妮说
<16-4,BECKETT>Castle, do you remember how Lanie said

517
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,280
<16-4,BECKETT>她在惠特妮的指甲和腰带下
<16-4,BECKETT>that she found traces of wax-covered cardboard

518
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,450
<16-4,BECKETT>都发现有封蜡木箱的痕迹吗
<16-4,BECKETT>under Whitney's nails and in her waistband?

519
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:43,510
<16-5,CASTLE>记得  怎么了
<16-5,CASTLE>Yeah, so?

520
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:46,840
<16-6,BECKETT>你知道什么东西是装在封蜡木箱里的吗
<16-6,BECKETT>So, you know what's wrapped in wax-covered cardboard?

521
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:49,780
<18-14,BECKETT>炸药
<18-14,BECKETT>Dynamite.

522
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,930
<16-6,BECKETT>她进来是为了偷炸药
<16-6,BECKETT>She broke in here to steal sticks of these.

523
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,160
<16-7,CASTLE>农民用炸药清理田地
<16-7,CASTLE>Ranchers use dynamite to clear their land.

524
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,800
<16-7,CASTLE>惠特妮偷炸药又要干什么
<16-7,CASTLE>What the hell was Whitney using it for?

525
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:04,510
<17-1,RYAN>知道惠特妮偷炸药想要做什么吗
<17-1,RYAN>Is there any indication why Whitney would steal dynamite?

526
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:05,650
<17-2,BECKETT>还不知道  但卡塞尔和我
<17-2,BECKETT>Not yet, but Castle and I

527
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:07,590
<17-2,BECKETT>正在试图回顾她的每一步行动
<17-2,BECKETT>have been re-tracing every move she made,

528
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:10,880
<17-2,BECKETT>就从她开溜的那次骑马旅行开始
<17-2,BECKETT>starting with that horseback-riding tour that she snuck away from.

529
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:13,330
<17-3,ESPOSITO>-知道她去了哪吗  -我四处问了问
<17-3,ESPOSITO>- Well, any idea where she was going? - I asked around,

530
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:15,370
<17-4,BECKETT>她走的那条路好像是
<17-4,BECKETT>and apparently, the trail that she took

531
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:17,700
<17-4,BECKETT>通往印第安保留区的
<17-4,BECKETT>led to the native American reservation.

532
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:21,140
<17-5,ESPOSITO>等等  不是那个亚瓦佩保留区吧
<17-5,ESPOSITO>Wait a minute -- it wasn't the Yavapai reservation, was it?

533
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,630
<17-6,BECKETT>就是  你怎么知道的
<17-6,BECKETT>Yeah. How'd you know?

534
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:23,870
<17-7,RYAN>历史协会
<17-7,RYAN>The historical society.

535
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:26,670
<17-7,RYAN>惠特妮查阅了18和19世纪时很生僻的
<17-7,RYAN>Whitney was looking up obscure documents and maps

537
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:28,880
<17-7,RYAN>一些地图和文件
<17-7,RYAN>from the late 18th, early 19th century.

538
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,810
<17-8,ESPOSITO>大多数都是关于
<17-8,ESPOSITO>Yeah, most of them had to do

539
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:32,650
<17-8,ESPOSITO>亚瓦佩保留区附近的一个水坝工程
<17-8,ESPOSITO>with the construction of a dam near the Yavapai reservation.

540
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,000
<17-9,BECKETT>有人知道她为什么调查那里吗
<17-9,BECKETT>Well, did anyone know why she was researching that area?

541
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,730
<17-10,ESPOSITO>没  但那可能就是
<17-10,ESPOSITO>No, but it's probably the

542
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:37,190
<17-10,ESPOSITO>她去那里的原因
<17-10,ESPOSITO>reason she went out there in the first place.

543
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:39,510
<17-11,RYAN>但这并没有解释为什么惠特妮需要炸药
<17-11,RYAN>But it doesn't explain why Whitney needed dynamite

544
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:40,860
<17-11,RYAN>或者她为什么会被毒杀
<17-11,RYAN>or why she was poisoned.

545
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,280
<17-12,BECKETT>这一切肯定都有联系
<17-12,BECKETT>Look, it's all got to be related.

546
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,880
<17-12,BECKETT>卡塞尔和我正要去那个保留区
<17-12,BECKETT>Castle and I are headed up to the reservation

547
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,540
<17-12,BECKETT>寻找...线索
<17-12,BECKETT>to get some answers... now.

553
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:09,220
<17-14,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我让你去找交通工具时
<17-14,BECKETT>Uh, Castle, when I asked you to find us a ride,

554
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,220
<17-14,BECKETT>我的想法是
<17-14,BECKETT>I was thinking of something

555
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:12,730
<17-14,BECKETT>类似于小货车之类的
<17-14,BECKETT>more along the lines of a pickup truck.

556
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,800
<17-14,BECKETT>保留区有20多公里远
<17-14,BECKETT>The reservation's 15 miles away.

557
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,740
<17-14,BECKETT>马车什么时候才能到啊
<17-14,BECKETT>This is gonna take forever.

<17-15,CASTLE>怎么跟你说呢
<17-15,CASTLE>Yeah, well, what can I tell you?

559
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:20,660
<17-15,CASTLE>这儿的一切都是正宗的西部风
<17-15,CASTLE>Everything here's authentic old west.

560
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:25,970
<17-15,CASTLE>真是的
<17-15,CASTLE>Really?

561
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:28,970
<17-16,BECKETT>无法抗拒是吗
<17-16,BECKETT>Couldn't resist, huh?

562
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:30,460
<17-16,BECKETT>非得搞一把六发式左轮手枪
<17-16,BECKETT>Just had to get a six shooter.

563
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:31,700
<17-17,CASTLE>是吧  很棒不是吗
<17-17,CASTLE>Right? Isn't it great?

564
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:33,170
<17-17,CASTLE>还有更赞的
<17-17,CASTLE>And it gets better.

567
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:40,060
<17-18,BECKETT>谁说"我愿意"后  浪漫就走入坟墓来着
<17-18,BECKETT>And who said romance dies after you say "I do"?

568
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,110
<17-19,CASTLE>埃斯波西托  莱恩  驾

573
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,100
<18-1,YAVAPAI ELDER>有点太冒犯了吧
<18-1,YAVAPAI ELDER>That's some real cultural insensitivity.

574
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,540
<18-2,BECKETT>抱歉  先生  我们无意冒犯
<18-2,BECKETT>Sorry, sir. We didn't mean any offense.

575
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:11,460
<18-2,BECKETT>我们在德蒙贝克度假
<18-2,BECKETT>We're -- we're vacationing at Diamondback.

576
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,150
<18-3,YAVAPAI ELDER>我看出来了
<18-3,YAVAPAI ELDER>Yeah, I figured that.

577
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,910
<18-3,YAVAPAI ELDER>我只是逗你们玩
<18-3,YAVAPAI ELDER>I was just messing with you folks.

578
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:15,860
<18-3,YAVAPAI ELDER>放轻松
<18-3,YAVAPAI ELDER>Relax.

579
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,100
<18-4,CASTLE>他骗到我了
<18-4,CASTLE>He got me. Yeah.

580
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,040
<18-5,YAVAPAI ELDER>欢迎
<18-5,YAVAPAI ELDER>Welcome.

581
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,470
<18-6,CASTLE>我叫里克
<18-6,CASTLE>Yeah. Well, I'm Rick.

582
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:23,120
<18-7,BECKETT>-好的  -这位是凯特
<18-7,BECKETT>- Yes. - This here is Kate.

583
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:26,730
<18-8,CASTLE>我们正在度蜜月
<18-8,CASTLE>And we... are on our honeymoon.

584
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:28,710
<18-8,CASTLE>-不是吗  宝贝  -当然
<18-8,CASTLE>- Ain't we, honey? - Yeah. We sure are.

585
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,510
<18-9,BECKETT>我们在德蒙贝克遇到个客人
<18-9,BECKETT>Um, so, we met a guest at Diamondback.

586
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,220
<18-9,BECKETT>她的名字叫惠特妮
<18-9,BECKETT>Her name was Whitney.

587
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,340
<18-9,BECKETT>她说她来这时
<18-9,BECKETT>She said that she came out here,

588
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,750
<18-9,BECKETT>发现了令人惊叹的景象
<18-9,BECKETT>and she discovered some breathtaking views.

589
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:38,410
<18-10,YAVAPAI ELDER>当然  我记得惠特妮  是个好姑娘
<18-10,YAVAPAI ELDER>Yeah, sure. I remember Whitney. Nice girl.

590
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:41,310
<18-11,BECKETT>几天前她骑着一匹阿帕卢萨马来到这
<18-11,BECKETT>She came out a few days ago riding an appaloosa.

591
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:43,510
<18-12,YAVAPAI ELDER>但她对风光可不感兴趣
<18-12,YAVAPAI ELDER>But she wasn't interested in the scenery.

592
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:46,880
<18-13,CASTLE>真的吗  她对什么感兴趣呢
<18-13,CASTLE>Really? What was she, uh, interested in?

593
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,210
<18-14,BECKETT>和炸药有关系吗
<18-14,BECKETT>Did it have anything to do with dynamite?

594
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:50,420
<18-15,YAVAPAI ELDER>炸药吗  不是的
<18-15,YAVAPAI ELDER>Dynamite? No.

595
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:53,030
<18-15,YAVAPAI ELDER>她只是对一个亚瓦佩词有疑问
<18-15,YAVAPAI ELDER>She just had a question about a yavapai word.

596
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,520
<18-16,CASTLE>-什么词  -Aha gah hel'lah
<18-16,CASTLE>- What word was that? - Aha gah hel'lah.

597
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:57,740
<18-17,YAVAPAI ELDER>她想知道这个词有没有歧义
<18-17,YAVAPAI ELDER>She wanted to know if it could be misinterpreted.

598
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:00,090
<18-18,CASTLE>-像是个奇怪的问题  -不
<18-18,CASTLE>- Seems an odd question. - Not really.

599
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:02,630
<18-19,YAVAPAI ELDER>我们许多词的词义会根据语境而改变
<18-19,YAVAPAI ELDER>Many of our words change depending on the context.

600
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,130
<18-19,YAVAPAI ELDER>Aha gah hel'lah的意思是河流
<18-19,YAVAPAI ELDER>Aha gah hel'lah means "River,"

601
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,060
<18-19,YAVAPAI ELDER>但有时也表示小溪
<18-19,YAVAPAI ELDER>but sometimes, it means "Stream."

602
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:08,740
<18-20,BECKETT>为什么她想知道那个词的意思呢
<18-20,BECKETT>Why would she want to know about that word?

603
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:09,680
<18-20,BECKETT>我不清楚
<18-20,BECKETT>I have no idea.

604
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,540
<18-21,YAVAPAI ELDER>但是听到我的答案惠特妮很高兴
<18-21,YAVAPAI ELDER>But Whitney was happy with my answer.

605
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,670
<18-21,YAVAPAI ELDER>谢过我之后她就走了
<18-21,YAVAPAI ELDER>She thanked me and left.

606
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,560
<18-22,CASTLE>就这样吗  我没明白
<18-22,CASTLE>And that was it? I don't get it.

607
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:16,930
<18-23,YAVAPAI ELDER>我也不太明白为什么
<18-23,YAVAPAI ELDER>Yeah, well, I don't get

608
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:19,870
<18-23,YAVAPAI ELDER>新婚夫妇穿得像牛仔一样来度蜜月
<18-23,YAVAPAI ELDER>newlyweds dressing up like cowboys on their honeymoon,

609
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,710
<18-23,YAVAPAI ELDER>但我还是不多说了
<18-23,YAVAPAI ELDER>but I try not to judge.

610
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,030
<19-1,CASTLE>关于惠特妮我们知道的越多
<19-1,CASTLE>You know, the more we learn about Whitney,

611
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:29,140
<19-1,CASTLE>我越发不明白她要干什么
<19-1,CASTLE>the less I understand about what she was up to.

612
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:31,000
<19-2,BECKETT>是啊  历史协会
<19-2,BECKETT>Yeah, I mean, the historical society,

613
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:33,350
<19-2,BECKETT>亚瓦佩词语  炸药
<19-2,BECKETT>the yavapai word, the dynamite --

614
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:36,250
<19-2,BECKETT>这些为什么会让人下毒害死惠特妮呢
<19-2,BECKETT>How does all of that add up to someone poisoning whitney?

615
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:37,610
<19-2,BECKETT>这都说不通啊
<19-2,BECKETT>It just doesn't make sense.

616
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,100
<19-3,CASTLE>你知道吗  还有些事也说不通
<19-3,CASTLE>You know what else doesn't make any sense

617
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:41,310
<19-3,CASTLE>那就是我们虽然结了婚
<19-3,CASTLE>is we're married, and...

618
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:43,290
<19-3,CASTLE>但一点儿也不像结了婚的样子
<19-3,CASTLE>we're not acting like it.

619
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,480
<19-4,BECKETT>你有什么想法  牛仔
<19-4,BECKETT>What do you got in mind, cowboy?

620
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,040
<19-4,BECKETT>承认吧  你被我的才华闪瞎了
<19-4,BECKETT>Admit it. You're impressed.

621
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:01,510
<20-1,CASTLE>是啊  的确
<20-1,CASTLE>Yeah, you're right. I am.

622
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:05,290
<20-2,BECKETT>事实上  这挺奇妙的
<20-2,BECKETT>This is actually... kinda magical.

623
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:11,440
<20-3,CASTLE>为我们  为这趟旅程  还有将来干杯
<20-3,CASTLE>To us, to the journey, and to what lies ahead.

624
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:24,860
<10-6,CASTLE>怎么啦
<10-6,CASTLE>What?

625
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:27,580
<20-4,CASTLE>你知道吗
<20-4,CASTLE>You know...

626
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,460
<20-5,BECKETT>或许这可以成为我们的蜜月
<20-5,BECKETT>Maybe this is our honeymoon.

627
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:52,610
<20-6,BECKET>卡塞尔  别动
<20-6,BECKET>Castle, don't move.

628
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,390
<20-7,CASTLE>你的愿望就是我的命令
<20-7,CASTLE>Your wish is my command.

629
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:57,070
<20-8,BECKETT>不  我是认真的  一步都别动
<20-8,BECKETT>No, I'm serious. Don't move an inch.

630
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,280
<20-9,CASTLE>不要
<20-9,CASTLE>Oh. No!

631
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:07,170
<20-9,CASTLE>不不  不要
<20-9,CASTLE>No, no, no, no, no.

632
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:09,220
<20-9,CASTLE>埃斯波  莱恩  回来
<20-9,CASTLE>Espo, Ryan, come back!

633
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,880
<20-9,CASTLE>伙计们  不  回来
<20-9,CASTLE>Guys! No, come back!

634
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:17,290
<20-10,CASTLE>你之前说得对
<20-10,CASTLE>Well, you were right before.

635
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:19,860
<20-10,CASTLE>这完全不是我们的蜜月
<20-10,CASTLE>This is so not our honeymoon.

636
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:30,960
<21-1,GRADY>谢天谢地
<21-1,GRADY>Well, thank goodness.

637
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:32,610
<21-1,GRADY>我们正准备派一队人马
<21-1,GRADY>We were fixing to put together a posse

638
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:34,140
<21-1,GRADY>去找你们俩呢
<21-1,GRADY>to go searching for the two of you.

639
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,320
<21-2,BECKETT>对不起  格拉迪先生
<21-2,BECKETT>Yeah, sorry, Mr. Grady.

640
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,150
<21-2,BECKETT>我们想给你打电话的
<21-2,BECKETT>We tried to call you,

641
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:38,720
<21-2,BECKETT>但山里头没信号
<21-2,BECKETT>but we couldn't get a signal in the hills.

642
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,230
<21-3,GRADY>你们的马几小时前就回来了  怎么了
<21-3,GRADY>Your horses came back hours ago. What happened up there?

643
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:42,780
<21-4,CASTLE>我们遇到了和你的度假村同名的东西
<21-4,CASTLE>We met a namesake of your ranch.

644
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,930
<21-5,GRADY>响尾蛇  好吧
<21-5,GRADY>Oh, a rattler. Yeah.

645
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:47,260
<21-5,GRADY>你们回酒吧
<21-5,GRADY>Well, why don't you mosey on over to the cantina

646
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:50,290
<21-5,GRADY>吃点东西  再喝点新鲜果汁
<21-5,GRADY>and strap on a feed bag and get some fresh jitter juice in you?

647
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:51,320
<21-6,BECKETT>我们会的
<21-6,BECKETT>Yeah, I think we'll do that.

648
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,130
<21-7,CASTLE>换上干净的衣服我们马上就去
<21-7,CASTLE>Yeah, just as soon as we get on some fresh union suits.

649
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,270
<22-1,GATES>你们找到被害人的行李箱了吗
<22-1,GATES>You found our victim's suitcases?

650
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,610
<22-2,ESPOSITO>是的  长官  全境通告发出后
<22-2,ESPOSITO>Yes, sir -- our B.O.L.O. got a hit

651
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:04,320
<22-2,ESPOSITO>得以找到在地铁被流浪汉拿走的箱子
<22-2,ESPOSITO>on the homeless guy who took them from the subway.

652
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,770
<22-3,RYAN>里面是惠特妮做的调查
<22-3,RYAN>Inside is Whitney's research

653
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:09,630
<22-3,RYAN>还有我们之前没见过的东西  一封信
<22-3,RYAN>and something we haven't seen before -- a letter.

654
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:11,120
<22-4,ESPOSITO>没有寄件人地址
<22-4,ESPOSITO>There was no return address,

655
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,000
<22-4,ESPOSITO>但上面有一个亚利桑那州1992年的邮戳
<22-4,ESPOSITO>but it's got an Arizona postmark dated 1992.

656
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,350
<22-5,GATES>20年前的信
<22-5,GATES>A 20-year-old letter?

657
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:18,090
<22-5,GATES>小竹竿  由瑞贝卡·杜林转交
<22-5,GATES>"Slim, in care of Rebecca Doolin."

658
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:21,010
<22-6,ESPOSITO>-寄到新泽西  -希望找到杜林女士
<22-6,ESPOSITO>- Jersey address. - Yeah, we're hoping to track down Ms. Doolin

659
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:22,030
<22-6,ESPOSITO>我们就能找到一些答案
<22-6,ESPOSITO>so we can get some answers.

660
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:23,490
<22-7,RYAN>这封信是个名叫克莱德的人写的
<22-7,RYAN>The letter's from a guy named Clyde.

661
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:25,000
<22-7,RYAN>我们认为照片上的人就是他
<22-7,RYAN>We assume that the photograph is him.

662
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:28,520
<22-8,GATES>这里说克莱德是德蒙贝克的一个季节工
<22-8,GATES>It says here that Clyde was a seasonal worker at Diamondback.

663
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:31,040
<22-9,RYAN>20年前  那还不是个度假村
<22-9,RYAN>Yeah, 20 years ago, before the place was a resort.

664
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,980
<22-9,RYAN>但有趣的是
<22-9,RYAN>But here's the interesting part.

665
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,700
<22-9,RYAN>信上克莱德不停地讲
<22-9,RYAN>In the letter, Clyde goes on about

666
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,330
<22-9,RYAN>他和一个名叫杜奇的人
<22-9,RYAN>how he and a guy named Dutch

667
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:39,380
<22-9,RYAN>即将揭开一个大秘密
<22-9,RYAN>were close to figuring out some big secret.

668
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,540
<23-1,CASTLE>什么大秘密
<23-1,CASTLE>What big secret?

669
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,100
<23-2,RYAN>信上没有说  但克莱德写道
<23-2,RYAN>It doesn't say, but Clyde wrote,

670
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,680
<23-2,RYAN>我只需要再多几周  小竹竿
<23-2,RYAN>"I just need a few more weeks.

671
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,220
<23-2,RYAN>杜奇和我已经很接近了
<23-2,RYAN>"Slim, Dutch, and I are so close.

672
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:49,700
<23-2,RYAN>全都是因为一个亚瓦佩词
<23-2,RYAN>"It all comes down to a mistranslation

673
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:52,190
<23-3,CASTLE>-理解错误  -让我猜猜
<23-3,CASTLE>- of a Yavapai word." - Let me guess.

674
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:54,950
<23-4,RYAN>-Aha gah hel'lah  -是的  你怎么知道
<23-4,RYAN>- Aha gah hel'lah. - Yeah, how'd you know?

675
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:57,870
<23-5,CASTLE>这和惠特妮问亚瓦佩长老的是同一个词
<23-5,CASTLE>It's the same word Whitney was asking the Yavapai elder about.

676
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:58,930
<23-6,RYAN>克莱德接下去是这么写的
<23-6,RYAN>Well, Clyde goes on to write,

677
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:00,990
<23-6,RYAN>"我无法相信一个不起眼的古老词汇"
<23-6,RYAN>"I can hardly believe that one little, old word"

678
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:03,570
<23-6,RYAN>"竟然是解开孔雀兄弟秘密的关键"
<23-6,RYAN>"is the key to the secret of the Peacock boys."

679
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:05,370
<23-6,RYAN>"等我找到了宝藏  我就回家找你"
<23-6,RYAN>"As soon as I find it, I'm coming on home to you."

680
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:06,680
<23-6,RYAN>"爱你  克莱德"
<23-6,RYAN>"Love, Clyde."

681
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,570
<23-7,CASTLE>孔雀兄弟  哪里听过似的...
<23-7,CASTLE>The Peacock boys -- how do I know...

682
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,200
<23-7,CASTLE>他们是那对通缉犯
<23-7,CASTLE>They're wanted men.

683
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,960
<23-7,CASTLE>科尼利厄斯和珀西·孔
<23-7,CASTLE>Cornelius and Percy Pea...

684
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:18,010
<23-7,CASTLE>雀
<23-7,CASTLE>...cock.

685
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:20,560
<23-8,BECKETT>莱恩  你知道信里提到那些人是谁吗
<23-8,BECKETT>Hey, Ryan, any idea who those people in the letter are?

686
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,610
<23-9,RYAN>不  哈维正在调查这位收件女士的下落
<23-9,RYAN>No, but Javi's trying to track down the lady who the letter was sent to.

687
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:24,650
<23-9,RYAN>我会及时通知你的
<23-9,RYAN>I'll keep you posted.

<23-10,CASTLE>谢谢  多谢  莱恩
<23-10,CASTLE>Thank you. Thank you, Ryan.

691
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:30,350
<23-11,BECKETT>口水快擦擦  牛仔
<23-11,BECKETT>Eyes back in their sockets, cowboy.

692
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:32,300
<23-11,BECKETT>-还有个谋杀案要破呢  -说的对
<23-11,BECKETT>- We got a murder to solve. - Right.

693
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:35,090
<23-13,BECKETT>这个叫克莱德的是什么人
<23-13,BECKETT>Now, who is this Clyde fellow,

694
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:36,540
<23-13,BECKETT>为什么被害人会有他的信件
<23-13,BECKETT>and why did our victim have his letter?

695
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:39,420
<23-13,BECKETT>这些又和孔雀兄弟有什么关系
<23-13,BECKETT>And what does any of this have to do with the Peacock boys?

696
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:41,790
<23-14,CASTLE>好问题  我知道谁能回答这些问题
<23-14,CASTLE>Good questions. And I know who has the answers.

697
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:42,540
<23-15,BECKETT>真的
<23-15,BECKETT>You do?

698
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:45,390
<23-16,CASTLE>西部片里只有他才能解答你的所有问题
<23-16,CASTLE>The same person who always has the answers in westerns --

699
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:47,660
<23-16,CASTLE>可亲可爱  无所不知的酒保
<23-16,CASTLE>The affable, all-knowing barkeep.

700
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:49,140
<24-1,BARTENDER>火车大盗
<24-1,BARTENDER>Train robbers.

701
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:52,120
<24-1,BARTENDER>1893年抢了一列南太平洋公司的火车
<24-1,BARTENDER>Held up the Southern Pacific back in 1893.

702
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:55,290
<24-1,BARTENDER>卷走了50块美国财政部金砖
<24-1,BARTENDER>Made off with 50 bars of US Treasury gold.

703
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:56,520
<24-2,CASTLE>金子
<24-2,CASTLE>Gold?

704
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:58,600
<24-3,BARTENDER>24K纯金  伙计
<24-3,BARTENDER>24-karat Au, feller.

705
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,360
<24-3,BARTENDER>孔雀兄弟穿过了亡者峡谷
<24-3,BARTENDER>Them Peacock boys -- they outrun a whole squad of soldiers

706
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,740
<24-3,BARTENDER>甩掉了一整队士兵
<24-3,BARTENDER>by traversing Deadman's Gorge.

707
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:06,820
<24-3,BARTENDER>两天之后  他们在菲尼克斯城外被击毙
<24-3,BARTENDER>Two days later, they was gunned down just outside of Phoenix.

708
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:08,200
<24-3,BARTENDER>但金子却不见了
<24-3,BARTENDER>But the gold was gone.

709
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:10,250
<24-4,BECKETT>金子的事难道没有人知道吗
<24-4,BECKETT>And no one knows anything about it?

710
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:11,580
<24-4,BECKETT>有不少传闻
<24-4,BECKETT>There were rumors.

711
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:14,760
<24-5,BARTENDER>1947年  传教士开始写下
<24-5,BARTENDER>1947, the missionaries started writing down

712
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,570
<24-5,BARTENDER>关于亚瓦佩人的古老故事
<24-5,BARTENDER>the old stories of the Yavapai people.

713
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:19,340
<24-5,BARTENDER>其中一个故事讲得是黑狐
<24-5,BARTENDER>One of them was about black fox --

714
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:22,950
<24-5,BARTENDER>一小孩  讲他被孔雀兄弟绑架后
<24-5,BARTENDER>Just a kid, abducted by them Peacock boys.

715
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:24,620
<24-5,BARTENDER>被迫做他们的向导
<24-5,BARTENDER>Forced him to be their guide.

716
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:26,810
<24-5,BARTENDER>他们在旅途中停了下来
<24-5,BARTENDER>But during their journey, they stopped,

717
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:29,820
<24-5,BARTENDER>他们把可怜的黑狐绑在一棵树上
<24-5,BARTENDER>and they tied poor black fox to a tree,

718
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,200
<24-5,BARTENDER>就在河的南岸
<24-5,BARTENDER>just south of the river,

719
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,210
<24-5,BARTENDER>他们驾着装满黄金的马车离开了
<24-5,BARTENDER>and they rode off in their gold-laden wagon.

720
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:35,460
<24-5,BARTENDER>他们回来之后
<24-5,BARTENDER>But when they returned...

721
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:38,380
<24-5,BARTENDER>黄金不见了
<24-5,BARTENDER>It was empty.

722
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:40,910
<24-6,CASTLE>孔雀兄弟把金子藏了起来
<24-6,CASTLE>The Peacock brothers stashed the gold.

723
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:42,190
<24-7,BARTENDER>其他人也都这么觉得
<24-7,BARTENDER>That's what everybody thought.

724
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,460
<24-7,BARTENDER>这个故事流传开后  寻宝猎人就...
<24-7,BARTENDER>When this story surfaced, treasure hunters --

725
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:45,860
<24-7,BARTENDER>纷涌而至
<24-7,BARTENDER>they came a-coming.

726
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,430
<24-8,CASTLE>-有人找到了吗  -没有
<24-8,CASTLE>- Anybody ever find it? - Nope.

727
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:51,970
<24-9,BARTENDER>所以这成为了西部的又一个传奇
<24-9,BARTENDER>And that's why this is just another legend of the old west.

729
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:54,210
<25-10,BECKETT>惠特妮是在找这些金子
<25-10,BECKETT>Whitney was after the gold.

730
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:57,040
<25-1,CASTLE>假如传教士在编写黑狐的故事的时候
<25-1,CASTLE>What if, when those missionaries wrote down black fox's story,

731
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,300
<25-1,CASTLE>他们把某些地方弄错了
<25-1,CASTLE>they wrote it down incorrectly?

732
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,910
<25-1,CASTLE>那个亚瓦佩词有两个意思  记得吗
<25-1,CASTLE>That Yavapai word has two meanings, remember?

733
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:03,330
<25-1,CASTLE>假如孔雀兄弟并没有把金子藏在河边
<25-1,CASTLE>What if the Peacocks didn't stash the gold near a river?

734
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:05,300
<25-1,CASTLE>假如他们是把金子藏在了小溪边
<25-1,CASTLE>What if they stashed it near a stream?

735
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:06,780
<25-1,CASTLE>卡塞尔
<25-1,CASTLE>Castle,

736
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:09,020
<25-2,BECKETT>快看这些惠特妮研究的地图
<25-2,BECKETT>look at these maps from Whitney's research.

737
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:13,110
<25-2,BECKETT>1893年时河北边还有条小溪流
<25-2,BECKETT>In 1893, there was a small stream north of the river.

738
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:15,910
<25-2,BECKETT>到了1920年因为修坝断流了
<25-2,BECKETT>And then, in 1920, it was dammed off.

739
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,350
<25-3,CASTLE>等等  也就是说这么多年
<25-3,CASTLE>Wait, that means all those years,

740
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:18,520
<25-3,CASTLE>大家找金子的地方
<25-3,CASTLE>everyone was looking for the gold

741
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,030
<25-4,BECKETT>-都错了  -都错了
<25-4,BECKETT>- In the wrong place. - In the wrong place!

742
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:21,140
<25-4,BECKETT>那也正是惠特妮需要炸药的原因
<25-4,BECKETT>That's why Whitney needed the dynamite,

743
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:23,780
<25-5,CASTLE>她要炸开藏金子的地方
<25-5,CASTLE>to blast open whatever hiding place it was in.

744
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:26,610
<25-5,CASTLE>发现50块金砖后  你会怎么办呢
<25-5,CASTLE>But what do you do when you discover 50 bars of gold,

745
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:28,310
<25-5,CASTLE>放在行李箱里飞回家吗
<25-5,CASTLE>fly it home in your carry-on?

746
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:30,370
<25-5,CASTLE>当然不是  于是她把金子留在这
<25-5,CASTLE>'course not. So she left it there.

747
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:31,940
<25-5,CASTLE>然后回到纽约寻求帮助
<25-5,CASTLE>She went back to New York for help.

748
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:34,180
<25-5,CASTLE>大概是凶手发现了她的秘密
<25-5,CASTLE>But perhaps the killer caught on to her,

749
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,860
<25-5,CASTLE>下毒杀她灭口
<25-5,CASTLE>poisoned her to silence her

750
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,570
<25-5,CASTLE>这样就能把那些金子据为己有
<25-5,CASTLE>and to keep the gold for themselves.

751
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:39,540
<25-6,BECKETT>惠特妮回家的时候  她很烦躁
<25-6,BECKETT>When Whitney went home, she was upset.

752
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:41,420
<25-6,BECKETT>那像是刚发现金子的人的表现吗
<25-6,BECKETT>Does that sound like someone who'd just found gold?

753
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:42,670
<25-6,BECKETT>好吧
<25-6,BECKETT>Okay.

754
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:44,870
<25-7,CASTLE>你难倒我了
<25-7,CASTLE>Mm, you got me there.

755
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,660
<25-7,CASTLE>但如果惠特妮是在找金子的话
<25-7,CASTLE>But if Whitney was searching for the gold

756
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:50,150
<25-7,CASTLE>凶手跟踪了她  那一定会有线索的
<25-7,CASTLE>and the killer tracked her, there could be clues.

757
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:51,790
<25-8,BECKETT>你一直在假设那些金子还在那里
<25-8,BECKETT>You keep assuming that the gold's still out there.

758
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:53,790
<25-8,BECKETT>别忘了  克莱德和杜奇以前也在找
<25-8,BECKETT>Don't forget, Clyde and Dutch were looking for it.

759
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:55,420
<25-8,BECKETT>他们也许已经找到了
<25-8,BECKETT>They might have found it.

760
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,920
<25-9,CASTLE>不会的  他们可没有惠特妮的那些老地图
<25-9,CASTLE>Not if they didn't have those old maps that Whitney had.

761
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,160
<25-10,BECKETT>你一心只想找那些金子
<25-10,BECKETT>You just want to go after the gold.

762
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,900
<25-10,BECKETT>我当然想找金子了  那可是金子啊
<25-10,BECKETT>Of course I want to go after the gold! It's gold!

763
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,500
<25-11,CASTLE>好吧  听着
<25-11,CASTLE>Okay, look.

764
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:04,730
<25-11,CASTLE>如果我们利用惠特妮的研究
<25-11,CASTLE>If we use Whitney's research,

765
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:08,080
<25-11,CASTLE>我们就有可能找到杀害惠特妮的凶手
<25-11,CASTLE>we may find Whitney's killer, too.

766
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:11,260
<25-11,CASTLE>拜托  贝克特  你说怎样
<25-11,CASTLE>Come on, Beckett. What do you say?

767
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,650
<25-11,CASTLE>没错  这是我
<25-11,CASTLE>Yeah, that's me.

768
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:16,960
<26-1,REBECCA DOOLIN>不过我已经不住在那里好些年了
<26-1,REBECCA DOOLIN>But I haven't lived at this address in years.

769
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,720
<26-2,ESPOSITO>瑞贝卡  谁是小竹竿
<26-2,ESPOSITO>Rebecca, who is Slim?

770
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:20,380
<26-3,REBECCA>她是我的一个朋友
<26-3,REBECCA>She was a friend of mine.

771
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,280
<26-3,REBECCA>她的真名是弗吉尼亚·威廉姆斯
<26-3,REBECCA>Her real name's Virginia Williams.

772
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,230
<26-4,ESPOSITO>她是有个女儿叫惠特妮吗
<26-4,ESPOSITO>Wait, did she have a daughter named Whitney?

773
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:26,980
<26-5,REBECCA>弗吉尼亚和我住在一起的时候正怀着惠特妮
<26-5,REBECCA>Well, Virginia was pregnant with Whitney when she stayed with me.

774
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:30,310
<26-5,REBECCA>-那会儿弗吉尼亚真是一团糟  -怎讲
<26-5,REBECCA>- Virginia was a real mess back then. - How so?

775
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:33,290
<26-7,REBECCA>怀着孕  没有钱  没有未来
<26-7,REBECCA>Knocked up, no money, no prospects.

776
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:36,280
<26-7,REBECCA>弗吉尼亚受够了收到类似这样的信件
<26-7,REBECCA>Virginia got so fed up with getting letters like these,

777
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:38,330
<26-7,REBECCA>她终于给克莱德写了绝交信
<26-7,REBECCA>She finally wrote Clyde a "Dear John" letter

778
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,470
<26-7,REBECCA>决定向前看了
<26-7,REBECCA>and moved on.

779
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,660
<26-8,ESPOSITO>-你是说克莱德是惠特妮的父亲  -没错
<26-8,ESPOSITO>- Wait, are you saying that Clyde is Whitney's father? - Mm-hmm.

780
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:45,250
<26-10,ESPOSITO>你知道克莱德现在在哪里吗
<26-10,ESPOSITO>Do you have any idea where Clyde is now?

781
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:47,600
<26-11,REBECCA>都20年了  我怎么知道
<26-11,REBECCA>It's been 20 years. How would I know?

782
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:51,050
<27-1,BECKETT>惠特妮一定是在母亲去世之后找到了克莱德的信
<27-1,BECKETT>Whitney must have found Clyde's letters after her mother passed.

783
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:52,600
<27-2,CASTLE>是的  然后便开始了她的寻宝之旅
<27-2,CASTLE>Yeah, and that's what started her quest.

784
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,720
<27-2,CASTLE>根据这张地图
<27-2,CASTLE>Now, according to the map.

785
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:58,130
<27-2,CASTLE>那条溪流应该就在这一带
<27-2,CASTLE>The stream used to be right around here...

786
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,100
<27-2,CASTLE>我想是吧
<27-2,CASTLE>I think.

787
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:02,770
<27-2,CASTLE>也许吧
<27-2,CASTLE>Maybe.

788
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:04,650
<27-3,BECKETT>我不知道
<27-3,BECKETT>I-I don't know.

789
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:08,580
<27-3,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你干吗呢
<27-3,BECKETT>Castle, what are you doing?

790
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:11,040
<27-4,CASTLE>我在追踪惠特妮寻金的脚步
<27-4,CASTLE>I am tracking Whitney's path to the gold.

791
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:13,810
<27-5,BECKETT>怎么个追踪法
<27-5,BECKETT>And how are you doing that?

792
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:15,890
<27-6,CASTLE>盯着地面看啊
<27-6,CASTLE>By staring at the dirt.

793
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:18,310
<27-6,CASTLE>所有老的西部片里都这么演
<27-6,CASTLE>That's how they do it in all the old Westerns.

794
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:21,110
<27-7,BECKETT>是  但人家是牛仔  你是个纽约客
<27-7,BECKETT>Yes, because they're cowboys. You're a New Yorker.

795
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,630
<27-7,BECKETT>-东部人  都市人  -没错
<27-7,BECKETT>- An Easterner. A city slicker. - Yes.

796
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:25,540
<27-8,CASTLE>正因为我是都市人  所以我可以
<27-8,CASTLE>And because I'm a city slicker, I can tell you,

797
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:27,840
<27-8,CASTLE>百分百确定地告诉你  惠特妮到过这
<27-8,CASTLE>with absolute certainty, Whitney was here.

798
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:29,400
<27-9,BECKETT>你怎么知道  你又不会凭脚印追踪
<27-9,BECKETT>How? You don't know how to read tracks.

799
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,370
<27-10,CASTLE>我是不会  但正因为我是纽约人
<27-10,CASTLE>No, no, but because I'm a New Yorker,

800
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:32,700
<27-9,BECKETT>我知道怎么凭垃圾追踪
<27-9,BECKETT>I know how to read litter.

801
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:34,330
<27-10,CASTLE>你看这个
<27-10,CASTLE>Check this out.

802
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:38,100
<27-10,CASTLE>烧焦的打蜡纸板
<27-10,CASTLE>Charred wax-covered cardboard.

803
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:41,120
<27-11,BECKETT>惠特妮肯定在附近引爆了炸药
<27-11,BECKETT>Whitney must have detonated the dynamite nearby.

804
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,350
<27-11,BECKETT>咱们接近了
<27-11,BECKETT>We're close.

805
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,160
<27-12,CASTLE>那里更多
<27-12,CASTLE>Ah. More there.

806
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:48,740
<27-12,CASTLE>贝克特  看啊
<27-12,CASTLE>Beckett, look at this.

807
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:53,440
<27-13,CASTLE>还真是有金子啊
<27-13,CASTLE>There's gold in them Thar Hills.

808
00:32:58,390 --> 00:32:59,650
<27-13,CASTLE>你先下去  看看有没有蛇
<27-13,CASTLE>You go first. Check for snakes.

809
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:05,880
<28-1,CASTLE>这地方真古老啊
<28-1,CASTLE>This place is old!

810
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,310
<28-1,CASTLE>这个矿肯定在孔雀兄弟藏金前
<28-1,CASTLE>This mine must have been abandoned

811
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:09,260
<28-1,CASTLE>就已经被遗弃了
<28-1,CASTLE>before the Peacock boys stashed their loot.

812
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:09,830
<28-2,BECKETT>慢点走  卡塞尔
<28-2,BECKETT>Slow down, Castle.

813
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:11,440
<28-2,BECKETT>-小心点  -开什么玩笑
<28-2,BECKETT>- Just be careful. - Are you kidding?

814
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,650
<28-3,CASTLE>这里可有宝藏  惠特妮找到了金子
<28-3,CASTLE>There's treasure in here. Whitney found the gold.

815
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:17,040
<28-4,BECKETT>又或者克莱德找到了金子  跟他的哥们杜奇分了
<28-4,BECKETT>Or Clyde found the gold and split it with his buddy Dutch

816
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,640
<28-4,BECKETT>然后抛弃了惠特妮母女
<28-4,BECKETT>and simply abandoned Whitney and her mom.

817
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,240
<28-5,CASTLE>我绝对确定克莱德没有找到金子
<28-5,CASTLE>I'm absolutely positive Clyde didn't find the gold.

818
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,360
<28-6,BECKETT>你怎么能这么确定呢
<28-6,BECKETT>And how can you be so sure, huh?

819
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:26,980
<28-7,CASTLE>因为金子还在
<28-7,CASTLE>Because it's still here.

820
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:31,910
<28-7,CASTLE>一个多世纪以来  50块金条
<28-7,CASTLE>For over a century, 50 ingots of pure gold

821
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:34,440
<28-7,CASTLE>一直被困在这个阴冷的墓穴中
<28-7,CASTLE>have been trapped in this cold, dark tomb,

822
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:38,800
<28-7,CASTLE>耐心地等待救援
<28-7,CASTLE>waiting patiently to be rescued.

823
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,080
<28-7,CASTLE>你听见了吗  贝克特
<28-7,CASTLE>You hear that, Beckett?

824
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,050
<28-7,CASTLE>你听见它们的呼唤了吗
<28-7,CASTLE>Do you hear them calling?

825
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:47,260
<28-8,CASTLE>它们在召唤我
<28-8,CASTLE>Calling to me.

826
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,580
<28-8,CASTLE>你的等待结束了  我的金子朋友
<28-8,CASTLE>Your wait is over, my golden friends.

827
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,340
<28-8,CASTLE>我来救你们了
<28-8,CASTLE>I'm here to save you.

828
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:56,610
<28-8,CASTLE>好吧
<28-8,CASTLE>Okay!

829
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,850
<28-9,CASTLE>这可不是金子
<28-9,CASTLE>That's not gold!

830
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:04,990
<29-1,BECKETT>-这是钝器外伤  -没错  而且凭这顶帽子
<29-1,BECKETT>- That's blunt-force trauma. - Yep. And given this hat,

831
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:07,130
<29-2,CASTLE>我就猜到死者是谁了
<29-2,CASTLE>I'm pretty sure I know who the victim is.

832
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,690
<29-4,CASTLE>-是克莱德  -没错
<29-4,CASTLE>- It's Clyde. - Yep.

833
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:09,450
<29-5,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你觉得
<29-5,BECKETT>Castle, do you think

834
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:11,600
<29-5,BECKETT>惠特妮是不是来这找她父亲的呢
<29-5,BECKETT>that Whitney came out here to find her dad?

835
00:34:11,910 --> 00:34:14,110
<29-6,CASTLE>这就能解释她离开时为什么那么难过了
<29-6,CASTLE>Well, that explains why she was so upset when she left.

836
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:16,630
<29-6,CASTLE>你猜的对  克莱德多年前就找到了宝藏
<29-6,CASTLE>You were right. Clyde found the treasure years ago.

837
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,740
<29-7,BECKETT>是  但他哥们杜奇摆了他一道
<29-7,BECKETT>Yeah, but then his buddy Dutch double-crossed him.

838
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:20,470
<29-7,BECKETT>杜奇自己独吞了金子
<29-7,BECKETT>Dutch took the gold for himself,

839
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:22,690
<29-7,BECKETT>把他的血衣丢下了
<29-7,BECKETT>left his blood-stained shirt behind.

840
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:24,370
<29-8,CASTLE>如果他已经杀过一次人了  那他为了
<29-8,CASTLE>And if he killed once, what's to stop him

841
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:26,290
<29-8,CASTLE>保护自己的秘密就会不惜代价再开杀戒
<29-8,CASTLE>from killing again to protect his secret?

842
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,140
<29-8,CASTLE>等会  如果惠特妮找到了她被害的父亲
<29-8,CASTLE>Wait, if Whitney found her murdered father,

843
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,190
<29-8,CASTLE>那她何不直接去找警长呢
<29-8,CASTLE>why not just go straight to the sheriff?

844
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:32,570
<29-8,CASTLE>为什么要坐第一班飞机回家呢
<29-8,CASTLE>Why take the first flight home?

845
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,870
<29-9,BECKETT>去找杀害她父亲的凶手对质  杜奇只是他的绰号
<29-9,BECKETT>To confront her father's killer. Dutch was just his nickname.

846
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,960
<29-9,BECKETT>卡塞尔  看  这件衬衣上有干洗店的标签
<29-9,BECKETT>Castle, look. There's a laundry tag on this shirt.

847
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,040
<29-9,BECKETT>上面有姓名缩写P.D.
<29-9,BECKETT>It has the initials "P.D."

848
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:44,150
<29-9,BECKETT>菲利普·达格玛
<29-9,BECKETT>Philip Dagmar.

849
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:47,660
<30-1,DAGMAR>我和惠特妮的死一点关系也没有
<30-1,DAGMAR>I had nothing to do with Whitney's death.

850
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:49,590
<30-2,RYAN>你确定吗  达格玛先生
<30-2,RYAN>Are you sure about that, Mr. Dagmar...

851
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:51,410
<30-2,RYAN>还是说你更喜欢我们叫你杜奇
<30-2,RYAN>or should we call you Dutch?

852
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,140
<30-3,RYAN>我们查过你的通话记录
<30-3,RYAN>We checked your phone records.

853
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,270
<30-3,RYAN>在惠特妮被害那天早上  你接到过一个
<30-3,RYAN>There was a call from the ranch pay phone

854
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:58,930
<30-3,RYAN>从牧场的公用电话打来的电话
<30-3,RYAN>to your cellphone the morning of Whitney's murder.

855
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,530
<30-4,ESPOSITO>她打过电话给你  对吧
<30-4,ESPOSITO>She called you, didn't she?

856
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:03,820
<30-4,ESPOSITO>她说了什么
<30-4,ESPOSITO>What did she say?

857
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:06,170
<30-5,DAGMAR>说她要飞回家
<30-5,DAGMAR>That she was flying home,

858
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:08,710
<30-5,DAGMAR>还说她要当面跟我谈谈
<30-5,DAGMAR>and she needed to speak with me in person.

859
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:10,100
<30-6,ESPOSITO>你之前为什么不告诉我们
<30-6,ESPOSITO>Why didn't you tell us this before?

860
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:13,140
<30-7,DAGMAR>-因为这会使我有嫌疑  -没错  的确如此
<30-7,DAGMAR>- Because it makes me look guilty. - You're right. It does.

861
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,250
<30-8,ESPOSITO>我敢说你在那个小镇里
<30-8,ESPOSITO>I bet you've still got connections

862
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:15,830
<30-9,RYAN>仍有人脉  对吧
<30-9,RYAN>in that one-horse town, don't you?

863
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:17,240
<30-10,DAGMAR>我为什么要杀惠特妮
<30-10,DAGMAR>Why would I kill Whitney?

864
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,170
<30-11,ESPOSITO>因为她发现了你的秘密  杜奇
<30-11,ESPOSITO>Because she knew about your secret, Dutch.

865
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:21,190
<30-11,ESPOSITO>我们找到了克莱德的尸骨
<30-11,ESPOSITO>We found Clyde's skeleton.

866
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:25,200
<30-12,RYAN>当年你拿走那50块金条时丢下的尸骨
<30-12,RYAN>The skeleton that you left when you took those 50 bars of gold.

867
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:28,150
<31-1,GRADY>你们是说关于孔雀兄弟
<31-1,GRADY>So you're saying that the story

868
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:30,730
<31-1,GRADY>和金子的故事是真的吗
<31-1,GRADY>about the Peacock boys and the gold is true?

869
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:32,440
<31-2,CASTLE>没错  还有人因此丧了命
<31-2,CASTLE>Yeah, and someone found out the hard way.

870
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,520
<31-3,DAISY MAY>这对生意可不利
<31-3,DAISY MAY>Well, that's not gonna be good for business.

871
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,710
<31-4,SHERIFF>你不用担心
<31-4,SHERIFF>Now, don't you worry none.

872
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,830
<31-4,SHERIFF>早在你们买下这里以前就有这个传说了
<31-4,SHERIFF>All that nonsense is from long before y'all bought the place.

873
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:41,160
<31-4,SHERIFF>不会有人被吓跑的  我会确保这点的
<31-4,SHERIFF>It's not gonna scare anyone off. And I'll make sure of it.

874
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:42,440
<31-5,DAISY MAY>谢谢你了  警长
<31-5,DAISY MAY>We appreciate that, sheriff.

875
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:44,770
<31-6,SHERIFF>吉米我要借用一下牧场的全地形车
<31-6,SHERIFF>Jimmy, I sure could use the ranch's ATVs

876
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:45,930
<31-6,SHERIFF>去一下那个矿井
<31-6,SHERIFF>to get up to this mine.

877
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:47,900
<31-7,GRADY>没问题  我们有两辆呢  你都拿去用吧
<31-7,GRADY>'Course. We got two of them. They're all yours.

878
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,420
<31-8,DAISY MAY>走吧  我带你过去
<31-8,DAISY MAY>Come on. I'll take you to them.

879
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:52,080
<31-9,SHERIFF>警探  可以请你给我带路吗
<31-9,SHERIFF>Detective, would you mind showing me the way?

880
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:52,980
<31-10,BECKETT>没问题
<31-10,BECKETT>Not a problem.

881
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:55,800
<31-10,BECKETT>我不在你要乖乖的  卡塞尔
<31-10,BECKETT>Try to stay out of trouble while I'm gone, Castle.

882
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,940
<31-11,CASTLE>那还有什么意思
<31-11,CASTLE>Where's the fun in that?

883
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,470
<31-12,GRADY>听起来你过得很精彩啊  孩子
<31-12,GRADY>Sounds like you had a hell of a day, son.

884
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,880
<31-12,GRADY>想不想坐下来给我讲讲
<31-12,GRADY>Want to bend an elbow and tell me all about it?

885
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:04,580
<31-12,GRADY>酒我请
<31-12,GRADY>Drinks are on me.

886
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:09,060
<32-1,DAGMAR>这些年来我已经为惠特妮尽力了
<32-1,DAGMAR>I did the best I could for Whitney all these years.

887
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:11,670
<32-1,DAGMAR>但她还是想知道她父亲的下落
<32-1,DAGMAR>But she wanted to find out what happened to her father.

888
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:14,220
<32-1,DAGMAR>天啊  我真不敢相信她找到他了
<32-1,DAGMAR>God, I can't believe she found him.

889
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:18,410
<32-2,ESPOSITO>她找到父亲后  你知道要做什么  对吧
<32-2,ESPOSITO>And when she did, you knew exactly what to do, didn't you?

890
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:19,750
<32-3,RYAN>于是你雇人给她下毒
<32-3,RYAN>So you hired someone to poison her.

891
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:21,540
<32-4,DAGMAR>不  我没杀惠特妮
<32-4,DAGMAR>No, I-I didn't kill Whitney.

892
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,210
<32-5,ESPOSITO>-但我知道是谁干的  -少来  杜奇  我们知道是你
<32-5,ESPOSITO>- But I think I know who did. - Come on, Dutch. We know it was you.

893
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:28,160
<32-6,DAGMAR>我和克莱德找不到那条小溪的所在地
<32-6,DAGMAR>Clyde and I couldn't find the location of the old stream.

894
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:31,940
<32-6,DAGMAR>于是我们找了个在镇里长大的人帮忙
<32-6,DAGMAR>So we enlisted the help of someone who grew up in the town.

895
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:35,100
<32-6,DAGMAR>我和克莱德计划找到金子后就上交国库
<32-6,DAGMAR>Clyde and I planned to turn in the gold

896
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:37,900
<32-6,DAGMAR>然后领取发现者奖金
<32-6,DAGMAR>and collect the finder's fee from the treasury.

897
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:40,320
<32-6,DAGMAR>但是我们的新同伙不同意
<32-6,DAGMAR>But our new partner disagreed.

898
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:41,770
<32-6,DAGMAR>他们打了起来
<32-6,DAGMAR>They fought,

899
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,970
<32-6,DAGMAR>然后克莱德跌倒  摔在一块石头上
<32-6,DAGMAR>and then Clyde fell, landed on a rock,

900
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:46,020
<32-6,DAGMAR>撞到了头
<32-6,DAGMAR>and hit his head.

901
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:48,460
<32-6,DAGMAR>几分钟内他就死了
<32-6,DAGMAR>He was dead in minutes.

902
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:51,040
<32-6,DAGMAR>那就是我出卖灵魂的时候
<32-6,DAGMAR>That's when I sold my soul...

903
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,180
<32-6,DAGMAR>为了25块金条
<32-6,DAGMAR>For 25 bars of gold.

904
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:58,240
<32-7,RYAN>达格玛先生  你的另外一位同伙是谁
<32-7,RYAN>Mr. Dagmar, who was your other partner?

905
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:06,430
<33-1,CASTLE>好酒
<33-1,CASTLE>Smooth.

906
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:07,500
<33-2,CASTLE>不好意思  接个电话
<33-2,CASTLE>Excuse me.

907
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,880
<33-2,CASTLE>莱恩  老西部没有手机
<33-2,CASTLE>Ryan, they didn't have mobile phone in the old west,

908
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:16,230
<33-2,CASTLE>你影响到了这里的气氛和我的酒兴
<33-2,CASTLE>so you're kind of killing the vibe and my buzz.

909
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:17,670
<33-3,RYAN>听着  贝克特跟你在一起吗
<33-3,RYAN>Listen, is Beckett with you?

910
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:18,830
<33-4,CASTLE>没有  怎么了
<33-4,CASTLE>No. Why?

911
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:20,560
<33-5,RYAN>我一直给她打电话发短信  她没接
<33-5,RYAN>I've been calling and texting. She's not answering.

912
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,740
<33-6,CASTLE>她在车上
<33-6,CASTLE>She's on a ATV.

913
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,320
<33-6,CASTLE>她可能听不见电话  怎么了
<33-6,CASTLE>She probably can't hear her phone. What's up?

914
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:26,500
<33-7,RYAN>还有一个同伙  他才是凶手
<33-7,RYAN>There was a third partner. He's the killer.

915
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:28,010
<33-8,CASTLE>警长吗
<33-8,CASTLE>The sheriff?

916
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:30,270
<33-9,RYAN>不  是詹姆斯·格拉迪
<33-9,RYAN>No, it's James Grady.

917
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,950
<33-10,GRADY>看来我们该告别了
<33-10,GRADY>Well, I guess this is goodbye.

918
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:48,460
<33-11,CASTLE>格拉迪  站住
<33-11,CASTLE>Grady, stop.

919
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:59,840
<33-12,GRADY>谁能阻止我  你吗
<33-12,GRADY>Who's gonna make me, son? You?

920
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:15,480
<34-1,CASTLE>听着  格拉迪  你
<34-1,CASTLE>L-look, Grady, you, uh...

921
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:18,570
<34-1,CASTLE>你杀了我  那你头上的凶案
<34-1,CASTLE>You'll kill me, that's just another murder

922
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:19,980
<34-1,CASTLE>又多了一桩
<34-1,CASTLE>you're gonna have to answer for.

923
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,080
<34-2,GRADY>如果我先赶到墨西哥就不会
<34-2,GRADY>Not if I make it to Mexico first.

924
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:24,190
<34-3,CASTLE>我不能让你跑掉
<34-3,CASTLE>I can't let that happen.

925
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:28,050
<34-4,GRADY>算你有种  孩子  这我得承认
<34-4,GRADY>You got sand, boy. I'll give you that much.

926
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:31,220
<34-4,GRADY>你为何不坐下  再喝一杯呢
<34-4,GRADY>Why don't you just sit on down and have another drink?

927
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:32,850
<34-4,GRADY>我说孩子
<34-4,GRADY>Come on, son.

928
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,730
<34-4,GRADY>想想你的妻子
<34-4,GRADY>think of your wife.

929
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:36,350
<34-5,CASTLE>正想着呢
<34-5,CASTLE>I am.

930
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:37,840
<34-5,CASTLE>好吧
<34-5,CASTLE>Fine.

931
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,430
<34-6,GRADY>如果你非要
<34-6,GRADY>If you got a hankering for a residence

932
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,180
<34-6,GRADY>找死
<34-6,GRADY>in the bone orchard,

933
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:44,410
<34-6,GRADY>我成全你
<34-6,GRADY>I'll accommodate you.

934
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,860
<34-6,GRADY>有遗言吗
<34-6,GRADY>Any last words?

935
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:49,720
<34-6,GRADY>有
<34-6,GRADY>Yeah.

936
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,000
<34-7,CASTLE>如果我活下来
<34-7,CASTLE>If I survive this...

937
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:55,440
<34-7,CASTLE>我要在大众点评上给这地方恶评
<34-7,CASTLE>I'm giving this place a scathing review on yelp.

938
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,890
<34-8,CASTLE>看来你看到莱恩的短讯了
<34-8,CASTLE>I, uh -- I guess you got Ryan's message.

939
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:37,930
<34-9,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我走开五分钟
<34-9,BECKETT>Castle, I leave you alone for five minutes,

940
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:39,470
<34-9,BECKETT>你就跟人单挑上了
<34-9,BECKETT>and you end up in a showdown?

941
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:40,540
<34-9,BECKETT>是的
<34-9,BECKETT>Yeah, well...

942
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,920
<34-10,CASTLE>好在我娶了东方最快女枪手
<34-10,CASTLE>Good thing I married the, uh, fastest gun from the east.

943
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:51,140
<35-1,SHERIFF>惠特妮是用自己名字入住的
<35-1,SHERIFF>Given that Whitney checked in under her own name,

944
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,050
<35-1,SHERIFF>格拉迪估计从她来到这里就盯上她了
<35-1,SHERIFF>Grady may have been onto her from the moment she arrived.

945
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:55,970
<35-2,CASTLE>或许没用多久就查明了她的来意
<35-2,CASTLE>Probably didn't take him long to figure out why she came.

946
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:58,450
<35-3,BECKETT>知晓之后  他跟着她来到矿厂
<35-3,BECKETT>And when he did, he must have followed her to the mine

947
00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:00,690
<35-4,SHERIFF>-看到了她的发现  -是的  她来的那天早上
<35-4,SHERIFF>- and seen what she discovered. - Yep. On the morning she left,

948
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:04,210
<35-4,SHERIFF>格拉迪在网上特意查了毛地黄下毒
<35-4,SHERIFF>Grady made specific internet searches on foxglove poisoning.

949
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:06,110
<35-5,BECKETT>看来证据确凿啊  警长
<35-5,BECKETT>Sounds like you got him dead to rights, sheriff.

950
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:08,540
<35-6,SHERIFF>加上你们的帮忙  是这样
<35-6,SHERIFF>Well, with what you did here, we sure do.

951
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,580
<35-6,SHERIFF>探长  我欠你人情
<35-6,SHERIFF>Detective, I'm in your debt.

952
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:11,740
<35-6,SHERIFF>保重
<35-6,SHERIFF>Y'all take care of yourselves.

953
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:12,660
<35-7,CASTLE>谢了  警长
<35-7,CASTLE>Thank you, sheriff.

954
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:17,960
<35-8,CASTLE>看来我们为这个镇除了害
<35-8,CASTLE>Well, I guess we cleaned up this town.

955
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:20,370
<35-9,BECKETT>是的
<35-9,BECKETT>Yeah, I reckon we did.

956
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:25,680
<35-10,CASTLE>该回家了
<35-10,CASTLE>So guess it's, uh, time to go home.

957
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,770
<36-1,ESPOSITO>不  但你知道最让我痛心的是什么吗
<36-1,ESPOSITO>No, no, but, well, you know what really gets me

958
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:37,300
<36-1,ESPOSITO>他们说只邀请了家人
<36-1,ESPOSITO>is that they said they only invited immediate family.

959
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,010
<36-1,ESPOSITO>怎么  我们不是家人吗
<36-1,ESPOSITO>What? We're not family?

960
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:40,670
<36-2,RYAN>更像是被嫌弃的亲戚
<36-2,RYAN>More like poor relations.

961
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,420
<36-3,RYAN>再说他们相爱
<36-3,RYAN>And we're probably the reason

962
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:43,420
<36-3,RYAN>-多半是因为我们  -可不是
<36-3,RYAN>- that they fell in love in the first place. - Right?

963
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:46,360
<36-5,GATES>我听你们抱怨了
<36-5,GATES>You know, I've been listening to your bellyaching

964
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:48,800
<36-5,GATES>好几天了  我不得不问
<36-5,GATES>for the last few days, and I have to ask --

965
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:50,430
<36-5,GATES>你俩脑袋被门挤了吗
<36-5,GATES>What the hell's wrong with you two?

966
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:52,490
<36-6,ESPOSITO>长官  难道这事一点都不困扰你吗
<36-6,ESPOSITO>Come on, sir. It doesn't bother you?

967
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:54,850
<36-7,GATES>你真的想知道我的看法吗  警探
<36-7,GATES>You really want to know what I think, detectives?

968
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:57,500
<36-7,GATES>我觉得你们应该停止抱怨
<36-7,GATES>I think that the two of you should stop whining

969
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:00,420
<36-7,GATES>不要搞得像小女孩没被邀请参加舞会一样
<36-7,GATES>like two little schoolgirls who weren't invited to the dance

970
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:03,330
<36-7,GATES>祝福你们的好友
<36-7,GATES>and be happy that your friends, your very dear friends,

971
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:04,930
<36-7,GATES>他们找到了办法走到一起
<36-7,GATES>have found a way to make it work,

972
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:07,960
<36-7,GATES>尤其是考虑到他们经历的一切
<36-7,GATES>especially after all the hell those two have been through.

973
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,340
<36-7,GATES>总之  我是这么想的
<36-7,GATES>Now, that's what I think.

974
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:13,610
<36-8,RYAN>你这么一说
<36-8,RYAN>Well, when you put it that way...

975
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:16,100
<36-9,ESPOSITO>是的  在某些人看来
<36-9,ESPOSITO>Yeah, I mean, I guess in some opinions,

976
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:18,720
<36-9,ESPOSITO>-我俩对这事是挺犯浑的  -是的
<36-9,ESPOSITO>- We have been kind of jerks about it. - I guess.

977
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,260
<36-11,GATES>没错
<36-11,GATES>Yeah. You have.

978
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,110
<36-11,GATES>不过如果你们感兴趣
<36-11,GATES>But if you're interested,

979
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:26,200
<36-11,GATES>你们还是能够弥补他们的
<36-11,GATES>there might be something you could do to make it up to them.

980
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:32,140
<37-1,TOBIAS>里克  看到你们走我好难过
<37-1,TOBIAS>Well, Rick, sorry to see you guys go.

981
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:34,300
<37-2,CASTLE>我也是  但是没办法
<37-2,CASTLE>Oh, yeah, me, too, but, uh, it couldn't be helped.

982
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:37,590
<37-3,BECKETT>嗨  牛仔
<37-3,BECKETT>Hey, there, cowboy.

983
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:39,630
<37-3,BECKETT>这么急要去哪儿啊
<37-3,BECKETT>Where you off to in such a hurry?

984
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:40,540
<37-3,BECKETT>贝克特  你在干什么
<37-3,BECKETT>Beckett, what are you doing?

985
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:41,340
<37-4,CASTLE>我们会错过航班的
<37-4,CASTLE>We're gonna miss our flight.

986
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:42,580
<37-4,CASTLE>你早上就得到分局
<37-4,CASTLE>You got to be in the office by morning.

987
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:44,470
<37-6,CASTLE>-不用  -怎么不用
<37-6,CASTLE>- No, I don't. - Yeah, you do.

988
00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:47,170
<37-6,CASTLE>-你没有可用假期了  -事实上  我有
<37-6,CASTLE>- You don't have any personal days left. - Actually, I kind of do.

989
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:49,460
<37-7,BECKETT>作为结婚礼物  莱恩和埃斯波西托
<37-7,BECKETT>For our wedding gift, Ryan and Esposito

990
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:53,320
<37-7,BECKETT>各自腾出一个假期给了我
<37-7,BECKETT>have both agreed to give me two of their vacation days each.

991
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,080
<37-8,CASTLE>-是吗  -是的
<37-8,CASTLE>- They did? - Yeah.

992
00:41:55,090 --> 00:41:56,520
<37-9,BECKETT>现在我们有四天
<37-9,BECKETT>So, now we have four days

993
00:41:56,520 --> 00:42:00,380
<37-9,BECKETT>想做什么  就做什么
<37-9,BECKETT>to do whatever...we...want.

994
00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:03,910
<37-10,CASTLE>你想留在这
<37-10,CASTLE>And you want to stay here?

995
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,050
<37-11,BECKETT>当然
<37-11,BECKETT>Of course I want to stay.

996
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,240
<37-11,BECKETT>毕竟  这是我们的蜜月
<37-11,BECKETT>After all, this is our honeymoon.

997
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,310
<37-12,BECKETT>等等  我们还是会去岛上度假吧
<37-12,BECKETT>Oh, wait. We're gonna still go to that island getaway, right?

998
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:13,940
<37-13,CASTLE>-当然  -那就好
<37-13,CASTLE>- Yes. Absolutely. - Okay, good.
