3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,730
<1-1,RENZO>长途飞行吗
<1-1,RENZO>Long flight?

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,480
<1-2,MATHIAS>简直没完没了  还有多远
<1-2,MATHIAS>Endless. How much further?

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,670
<1-3,RENZO>还有些时间
<1-3,RENZO>You have some time.

6
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:18,680
<1-3,RENZO>如果想睡觉  请随意  先生
<1-3,RENZO>If you want to sleep, go ahead, sir.

7
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:41,770
<1-3,RENZO>我给你弄了杯咖啡
<1-3,RENZO>Hey! I made some coffee for you.

8
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:43,610
<1-3,RENZO>失眠者的力量来源
<1-3,RENZO>It's insomniac strength.

9
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:48,500
<2-1,KATE BECKETT>你已经连续四天晚上没睡觉了
<2-1,KATE BECKETT>This is the fourth night in a row that you haven't slept.

10
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:49,830
<2-1,KATE BECKETT>-出什么事了  -我不知道
<2-1,KATE BECKETT>- Something wrong? - I don't know.

11
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:52,540
<2-2,RICHARD CASTLE>可能我的潜意识迫切想要我
<2-2,RICHARD CASTLE>Maybe my subconscious has a pressing need to...

12
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,610
<2-2,RICHARD CASTLE>查看脸书网上谁给我点赞了
<2-2,RICHARD CASTLE>catch up on my facebook likes.

13
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:57,290
<2-3,BECKETT>-玛莎  早上好  -早上好  亲爱的
<2-3,BECKETT>- Martha, good morning. - Ah. Good morning, darling.

<2-5,BECKETT>-来点早餐吗  -不  谢谢
<2-5,BECKETT>- Would you like some breakfast? - No, thank you.

17
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,330
<2-6,MARTHA>为了保持清醒  我要禁食
<2-6,MARTHA>I'm, uh, fasting for clarity.

18
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:04,840
<2-6,MARTHA>我受邀为斯托帕德 的新戏做试演
<2-6,MARTHA>I have been asked to read for the new Stoppard play.

20
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,640
<2-7,CASTLE>有什么问题
<2-7,CASTLE>So what's the problem?

21
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,700
<2-8,MARTHA>我已经很久没有参加试镜了
<2-8,MARTHA>Well, I haven't auditioned for anything in ages.

23
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,320
<2-8,MARTHA>我需要知道我的天赋
<2-8,MARTHA>I think I need to decide if that particular train

24
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,940
<2-8,MARTHA>是否还依然存在
<2-8,MARTHA>has left the station.

26
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:16,920
<2-9,CASTLE>"凯萨琳·贝克特女士收"  这是什么
<2-9,CASTLE>"Ms. Katherine beckett"? What's this?

27
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,040
<2-10,BECKETT>有个前男友要结婚了
<2-10,BECKETT>Oh, an ex is getting married.

28
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:20,530
<2-10,BECKETT>你还记得威尔·索伦森吗
<2-10,BECKETT>Do you remember Will Sorenson?

29
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:22,040
<2-11,CASTLE>-你那个联调局前男友吗  -是的
<2-11,CASTLE>- Your old F.B.I. Squeeze? - Yeah.

30
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,010
<2-13,CASTLE>真是幸运  我出现在你生活中
<2-13,CASTLE>Oh, man. I'm so lucky I came along

31
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:26,670
<2-14,BECKETT>-拯救你脱离苦海  -等等  你拯救了我吗
<2-14,BECKETT>- and saved you from that life. - Wait. You saved me?

32
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,050
<2-15,CASTLE>拜托  你自己也得承认他无聊透了
<2-15,CASTLE>Come on. Even you have to admit he was boring.

33
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:31,500
<2-15,CASTLE>像有线卫星公众事务网络一样无聊
<2-15,CASTLE>Like, C-SPAN boring.

34
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:33,460
<2-16,BECKETT>你凭什么认为
<2-16,BECKETT>You know, what makes you think

35
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,640
<2-16,BECKETT>如果你不出现  我还会和索伦森在一起呢
<2-16,BECKETT>that I would be with Sorenson if you hadn't come along?

36
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,330
<2-17,CASTLE>好吧  那你会在哪
<2-17,CASTLE>All right, where would you be?

37
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:39,400
<2-18,BECKETT>-如果没有你在周围捣乱  -是的
<2-18,BECKETT>- If you weren't around to distract me? - Yeah.

38
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,240
<2-19,CASTLE>我可能会成为...
<2-19,CASTLE>Um, I would probably be...

39
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,430
<2-20,BECKETT>我自己分局的警监
<2-20,BECKETT>captain of my own precinct.

40
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:44,210
<2-21,CASTLE>-厉害  -没错
<2-21,CASTLE>- Wow. - Yeah.

41
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:46,910
<2-22,BECKETT>好吧  如果我没有被你迷住的话
<2-22,BECKETT>Okay. Had I not been bewitched by you,

42
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:49,830
<2-23,CASTLE>现在我可能在写第二本普利策得奖作品了
<2-23,CASTLE>I think by now I'd be working on my second Pulitzer.

43
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:52,300
<2-24,BECKETT>-这么说我们拖彼此的后腿了  -糟透了
<2-24,BECKETT>- So we're bad for each other, huh? - The worst.

44
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,780
<2-26,BECKETT>如果我们从未相遇的话可能会更好
<2-26,BECKETT>I guess we'd both be better off if we'd never met.

45
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,940
<2-27,CASTLE>就像是电影《美好人生》
<2-27,CASTLE>It's like "It's a wonderful life."

46
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:02,520
<2-27,CASTLE>每次你电话一响  就意味着有人遇害了
<2-27,CASTLE>Every time your phone rings, a victim gets their wings.

48
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:07,030
<3-1,KEVIN RYAN>他的名字叫马提亚斯·甘斯勒
<3-1,KEVIN RYAN>His name is Mathias Gensler.

49
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,210
<3-1,KEVIN RYAN>他的护照显示他是瑞士籍公民
<3-1,KEVIN RYAN>His passport indicates that he is a Swiss national.

50
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:12,690
<3-1,KEVIN RYAN>目击者称  两个蒙面人
<3-1,KEVIN RYAN>Witnesses said that two masked men

51
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:15,230
<3-1,KEVIN RYAN>袭击了司机和甘斯勒
<3-1,KEVIN RYAN>attacked both the driver and Gensler

52
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:17,390
<3-1,KEVIN RYAN>然后把甘斯勒先生的手腕砍下来
<3-1,KEVIN RYAN>before cutting a silver briefcase

53
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,000
<3-1,KEVIN RYAN>抢走了和他拷在一起的银色公文包
<3-1,KEVIN RYAN>handcuffed to Mr. Gensler's wrist.

54
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,260
<3-2,BECKETT>这是一起埋伏  作案的人
<3-2,BECKETT>So this was an ambush. Whoever did this

55
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,700
<3-2,BECKETT>知道他随身携带着这个公文包
<3-2,BECKETT>knew that he had that case with him.

56
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,890
<3-3,RYAN>看起来袭击者驾驶一辆
<3-3,RYAN>Looks like the attackers fled

57
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:26,010
<3-3,RYAN>无牌照的新型奔驰车逃跑的
<3-3,RYAN>in a late model G-Wagon, no plates.

58
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:28,970
<3-4,CASTLE>他衬衣上是鞋印吗
<3-4,CASTLE>Is that a boot print on his shirt?

59
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:31,270
<3-5,BECKETT>凶手一定踩着他不让他起身
<3-5,BECKETT>The killer must have held him down with his foot.

60
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:33,040
<3-6,CASTLE>公文包里有什么
<3-6,CASTLE>So what was in the case?

61
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,840
<3-6,CASTLE>核启动代码  还是致命病毒
<3-6,CASTLE>Nuclear launch codes? Deadly virus?

62
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,880
<3-7,RYAN>我们还不知道  司机的记录显示
<3-7,RYAN>We don't know yet. The driver's log shows

63
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,190
<3-7,RYAN>从特波罗机场接到甘斯勒先生
<3-7,RYAN>that Mr. Gensler was picked up at Teterboro airport

64
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:41,840
<3-7,RYAN>他是从瑞士来的私人包机上下来的
<3-7,RYAN>after arriving on a private charter flight from Switzerland.

65
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:43,130
<3-8,BECKETT>车送他去哪里
<3-8,BECKETT>And where was the car taking him?

66
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,510
<3-9,RYAN>这只显示了接他的地点
<3-9,RYAN>The manifest only lists the pickup.

67
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,910
<3-10,BECKETT>-给租车公司打电话了吗  -没人可以找
<3-10,BECKETT>- You call the car company? - Uh, there's no one to call.

68
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:49,020
<3-11,RYAN>那个司机  伦佐·康拉德  他就是老板
<3-11,RYAN>The driver -- Renzo Conrad -- owned the service.

69
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,450
<3-11,RYAN>他一个人单干
<3-11,RYAN>He was a one-man band.

70
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:53,550
<3-12,BECKETT>说到单干  你的搭档呢
<3-12,BECKETT>Speaking of "One-man band," where's your partner?

71
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:56,030
<3-13,CASTLE>是啊  还有蕾妮呢
<3-13,CASTLE>Yeah! And Lanie.

72
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,880
<3-14,LANIE PARISH>等等
<3-14,LANIE PARISH>Wait! Wait.

73
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,260
<3-15,JAVIER ESPOSITO>我们来了  我们刚才...
<3-15,JAVIER ESPOSITO>We're here. We were just, uh...

74
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,110
<3-16,LANIE>-有点堵车  -是的
<3-16,LANIE>- Stuck in traffic. - Yeah.

75
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,520
<3-17,ESPOSITO>你跟罗密欧汇报一下情况
<3-17,ESPOSITO>Why don't you bring Romeo here up to speed

76
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,740
<3-18,BECKETT>然后联系一下瑞士领事馆
<3-18,BECKETT>and contact the Swiss consulate.

77
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,680
<3-18,BECKETT>也许他们知道甘斯勒要干什么
<3-18,BECKETT>Maybe they know what Gensler was up to.

78
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:11,740
<3-19,LANIE>卡塞尔  你在对我的尸体做什么
<3-19,LANIE>Castle, what are you doing with my body?

79
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,880
<3-20,BECKETT>假装不认识他好了
<3-20,BECKETT>Just pretend like you don't know him.

80
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,360
<3-21,CASTLE>贝克特  这不是土
<3-21,CASTLE>Beckett, this is not dirt.

81
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,570
<3-21,CASTLE>是打火石  少许碳
<3-21,CASTLE>It's flint... hints of carbon.

82
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,450
<3-21,CASTLE>这是煤
<3-21,CASTLE>That's coal.

83
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,960
<3-21,CASTLE>-是粉末状未经提炼的煤  -然后呢
<3-21,CASTLE>- It's pulverized, unrefined coal. - So?

84
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,140
<3-23,CASTLE>我曾在一部早期的
<3-23,CASTLE>So I used a clue like this

85
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,210
<3-23,CASTLE>斯道姆小说里写过一个类似的线索
<3-23,CASTLE>in one of my early Derrick Storm books.

86
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:29,200
<3-23,CASTLE>除了在燃煤发电厂
<3-23,CASTLE>It's very unusual to find unrefined coal

87
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,730
<3-23,CASTLE>未经提炼的煤是很罕见的
<3-23,CASTLE>outside a Coal-Fired power plant.

88
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:32,310
<3-24,BECKETT>城里的燃煤发电厂
<3-24,BECKETT>All the coal plants in the city are either

89
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,310
<3-24,BECKETT>要么被关闭  要么转型了
<3-24,BECKETT>shut down or converted.

90
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,810
<3-25,CASTLE>是的  但是有的厂子依然存在
<3-25,CASTLE>Right, but some of them are still standing.

91
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,230
<3-25,CASTLE>在哈德森就有个被废弃的工厂
<3-25,CASTLE>There's an abandoned one on Hudson

92
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,460
<3-25,CASTLE>他们准备把它建成一个购物中心
<3-25,CASTLE>they're gonna turn into a shopping mall.

93
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,940
<3-26,BECKETT>煤灰可能从别的地方来的
<3-26,BECKETT>Coal dust could have come from a lot of places.

94
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,020
<3-27,CASTLE>废弃的燃煤发电厂
<3-27,CASTLE>An abandoned plant would be a perfect place

95
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,230
<3-27,CASTLE>是突袭的完美场所
<3-27,CASTLE>to launch a strike like this.

96
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:45,300
<3-28,BECKETT>蕾妮  你去鉴证组
<3-28,BECKETT>Lanie, why don't you get C.S.U. Techs

97
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,360
<3-28,BECKETT>检测一下死者衬衫上的残留物
<3-28,BECKETT>to test the substance on the victim's shirt?

98
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,300
<3-28,BECKETT>我们去特波罗机场查一下那架飞机
<3-28,BECKETT>We gotta go to Teterboro and look into that flight.

99
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,410
<3-29,CASTLE>那个燃煤发电厂正顺路
<3-29,CASTLE>And that coal plant is right on the way.

100
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:53,010
<3-30,BECKETT>好吧
<3-30,BECKETT>Fine.

101
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:54,650
<3-30,BECKETT>我们顺路去一下那个发电厂
<3-30,BECKETT>We'll stop off at the coal plant.

104
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,010
<4-1,CASTLE>你想去吗
<4-1,CASTLE>So you thinking about going?

105
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:06,870
<4-2,BECKETT>去哪
<4-2,BECKETT>Going where?

106
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,130
<4-3,CASTLE>索伦森的婚礼
<4-3,CASTLE>Sorenson's wedding.

107
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,260
<4-3,CASTLE>重温一下往日情怀
<4-3,CASTLE>Take a little trip down memory lane.

108
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,860
<4-4,BECKETT>我认为这不是个好主意
<4-4,BECKETT>I don't think that's such a good idea.

109
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:12,850
<4-5,CASTLE>为什么不呢
<4-5,CASTLE>Why not?

110
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:16,160
<4-6,BECKETT>我还没准备好参加别人的婚礼
<4-6,BECKETT>I'm not really ready for someone else's perfect day.

111
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:24,820
<5-1,CASTLE>如果可以改变过去  我愿意做任何事
<5-1,CASTLE>You know I'd give anything to change what happened, right?

112
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:26,570
<5-2,BECKETT>是的  我知道
<5-2,BECKETT>Yeah, I know you would.

113
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:29,880
<5-2,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<5-2,BECKETT>Castle.

114
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,960
<5-3,BECKETT>你说得对
<5-3,BECKETT>You were right.

115
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,400
<5-3,BECKETT>凶手的奔驰车在这
<5-3,BECKETT>The shooter's G-Wagon's here.

116
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:38,100
<5-3,BECKETT>埃斯波  我需要支援到哈德森燃煤厂来
<5-3,BECKETT>Espo, hey. I need backup at the Hudson river coal plant.

117
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:44,140
<6-1,CASTLE>公文包在那
<6-1,CASTLE>There's the case.

118
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:48,940
<6-2,BECKETT>里面有什么
<6-2,BECKETT>What's in it?

119
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,880
<6-3,CASTLE>像是某种手工艺品
<6-3,CASTLE>Some kind of artifact.

120
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:55,840
<6-4,BECKETT>想必是值钱东西才值得去杀人灭口
<6-4,BECKETT>Must be valuable if it was worth killing over.

121
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,360
<6-5,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你在干嘛
<6-5,BECKETT>Castle, what are you --

122
00:04:58,690 --> 00:04:59,790
<6-6,BECKETT>蹲下
<6-6,BECKETT>Get down!

123
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,350
<6-7,BECKETT>为什么你总是这么手贱
<6-7,BECKETT>Why do you always have to touch everything?

00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:58,920
<7-1,CASTLE>贝克特出事了
<7-1,CASTLE>Beckett's in trouble.

132

<7-1,CASTLE>我逃了出来  但她的车不见了
<7-1,CASTLE>I got away, but her car is missing.

133
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:03,330
<7-1,CASTLE>-我想她被绑架了  -警监
<7-1,CASTLE>- I think she was abducted. - Uh, Captain?

<7-4,RYAN>贝克特警监  这个人说你出事了
<7-4,RYAN>Captain Beckett, this guy claims you're in trouble.

<7-6,ESPOSITO>-警监  -你认识他吗
<7-6,ESPOSITO>- Captain? - You know him?

137
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,030
<7-7,BECKETT>我从没见过这个人
<7-7,BECKETT>I've never seen this man before in my life.

147
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:31,610
<8-1,CASTLE>从没见过我  好吧  真好笑
<8-1,CASTLE>Never seen me before? Okay, that's very funny.

148
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:33,460
<8-1,CASTLE>我只是很高兴你没事  你是怎么回来的
<8-1,CASTLE>I'm just glad you're okay. How did you get back here?

<8-3,CASTLE>我们遭遇枪战  顺便说句  这套衣服不错
<8-3,CASTLE>We were being shot at. That's a nice suit, by the way.

151
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,170
<8-4,BECKETT>不管你是谁  你该离开这了
<8-4,BECKETT>Whoever you are, I think you better leave.

<8-5,CASTLE>-不管我是谁  -走吧  老兄
<8-5,CASTLE>- Whoever I am? - Come on, pal.

<8-6,ESPOSITO>不管你嗑什么了  如果你悄悄离开这
<8-6,ESPOSITO>Ow! Whatever trip you're on, if you leave quietly,

154
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:45,870
<8-6,ESPOSITO>我们可以当什么事都没发生过
<8-6,ESPOSITO>I'm sure we can forget this ever happened.

155
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:49,030
<8-7,CASTLE>好了  我懂了  你们在整我
<8-7,CASTLE>Okay! Whoa-ho! I get it. You guys are punking me.

156
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:51,480
<8-7,CASTLE>抱歉  就像我生日那次
<8-7,CASTLE>Sorry. Just like, uh, my birthday.

157
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,040
<8-7,CASTLE>这招不错  你们怎么做到那么逼真的
<8-7,CASTLE>This is good. How did you stage that?

158
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,520
<8-7,CASTLE>双尸枪击案  那只断手
<8-7,CASTLE>The double shooting, the severed hand,

159
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,090
<8-7,CASTLE>衬衣上的煤灰
<8-7,CASTLE>coal dust on the shirt?

160
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:57,930
<8-8,ESPOSITO>他刚刚描述了案发现场
<8-8,ESPOSITO>He just described our crime scene.

161
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,920
<8-9,BECKETT>你从哪得到这些信息的
<8-9,BECKETT>Where did you get that information?

162
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:04,200
<8-10,CASTLE>从案发现场得到的  我跟你们三个
<8-10,CASTLE>From being... at the crime scene with...

00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:05,410
<8-10,CASTLE>一起去的啊
<8-10,CASTLE>all of you.

164
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:06,840
<8-11,RYAN>警监  我们五分钟前才拿到
<8-11,RYAN>Captain, we only got the forensics

165
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:08,080
<8-11,RYAN>法医的关于煤灰报告
<8-11,RYAN>about the coal dust five minutes ago.

166
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,380
<8-12,BECKETT>你是怎么知道这么多案件细节的
<8-12,BECKETT>And how do you know so much about this case?

167
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:13,440
<8-13,CASTLE>凯特  你们骗到我了  玩笑到此为止
<8-13,CASTLE>Kate, okay, you know what? You got me. Joke's over.

168
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,240
<8-14,BECKETT>你说的没错  到此为止了
<8-14,BECKETT>You're right. It is.

169
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,120
<9-1,CASTLE>伙计们
<9-1,CASTLE>Guys!

170
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:23,250
<9-1,CASTLE>真的假的  这是怎么回事
<9-1,CASTLE>Seriously, what's going on here?

171
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:26,760
<9-2,RYAN>理查德·卡塞尔先生  原来你是个小说家
<9-2,RYAN>Mr. Richard Castle. Ha, you're a novelist.

172
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:27,810
<9-2,RYAN>要不你给我们讲个故事
<9-2,RYAN>Why don't you tell us a story

173
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:29,800
<9-2,RYAN>讲讲早上四点至六点之间你在哪
<9-2,RYAN>about where you were between 4:00 and 6:00 A.M.?

174
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,260
<9-3,CASTLE>我和贝克特在床上
<9-3,CASTLE>In bed with Beckett.

175
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,770
<9-4,ESPOSITO>你还是不要这样诋毁警监吧
<9-4,ESPOSITO>Maybe you shouldn't talk about the captain like that.

176
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:35,230
<9-5,RYAN>你是怎么知道煤灰的事
<9-5,RYAN>How did you know about the coal dust?

177
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:37,620
<9-6,CASTLE>故事就是从那开始的  就在那个工厂
<9-6,CASTLE>Well, that's where all this started, at the plant.

178
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,680
<9-6,CASTLE>在那发生了
<9-6,CASTLE>There was --

179
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,530
<9-6,CASTLE>发生了爆炸
<9-6,CASTLE>There was an explosion.

180
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,080
<9-6,CASTLE>我一定是昏迷了  这是个梦境
<9-6,CASTLE>I must have gotten knocked out. This is a dream.

181
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,570
<9-6,CASTLE>你们只是我大脑创造出来的
<9-6,CASTLE>Okay? You guys are just creations of my psyche.

182
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,030
<9-6,CASTLE>我这是在解决心理问题
<9-6,CASTLE>This is me just working out some issues.

183
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:53,660
<9-6,CASTLE>所以你们不认识我  因为你们并不存在
<9-6,CASTLE>That's why you don't know me, because you aren't real.

184
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:55,280
<9-6,CASTLE>你们知道吗  我可以证明
<9-6,CASTLE>And you know what? I can prove it.

185
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,160
<9-6,CASTLE>众所周知
<9-6,CASTLE>Well-known fact,

186
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,380
<9-6,CASTLE>在梦境里是看不清字的
<9-6,CASTLE>it's impossible to read in a dream.

187
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:02,510
<9-8,CASTLE>'理查德·卡塞尔  又名理查德·罗杰斯'
<9-8,CASTLE>"Richard Castle, A.K.A. Richard Rodgers."

188
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:03,590
<9-9,ESPOSITO>你吓着我了
<9-9,ESPOSITO>You had me worried there.

189
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:05,300
<9-9,ESPOSITO>我刚刚还真以为我不存在呢
<9-9,ESPOSITO>For a second, I thought I didn't exist.

190
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,500
<9-9,ESPOSITO>打住打住
<9-9,ESPOSITO>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey --

191
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,820
<9-10,CASTLE>这里写着我跳上了梅西百货的游行花车
<9-10,CASTLE>It says here I jumped on a Macy's parade float

192
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,890
<9-10,CASTLE>接着和伊迪娜·门泽尔合唱了《随他吧》
<9-10,CASTLE>and sang "Let it go" with Idina Menzel

193
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:13,190
<9-10,CASTLE>然后坐着热气球在中央公园裸体着陆了
<9-10,CASTLE>and then landed a hot-air balloon naked in central park?

194
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,470
<9-10,CASTLE>我没做过这些  伙计们
<9-10,CASTLE>I didn't do these things, guys.

195
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:17,360
<9-10,CASTLE>拜托  我绝不会跟人合唱《随他吧》的
<9-10,CASTLE>Come on. I would never sing "Let it go" as a duet.

196
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:20,150
<9-11,RYAN>卡塞尔先生  如果你告诉我们
<9-11,RYAN>Mr. Castle, this is gonna go much easier for you

197
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,780
<9-11,RYAN>你对于谋杀案有什么了解  事情会简单很多
<9-11,RYAN>if you just tell us what you know about those murders.

198
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,020
<9-12,CASTLE>好吧  凯特
<9-12,CASTLE>Okay, Kate? Kate!

199
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:24,620
<9-13,RYAN>这家伙疯了
<9-13,RYAN>This guy's nuts.

200
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,350
<9-13,RYAN>出来
<9-13,RYAN>Come on.

201
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:27,670
<9-14,CASTLE>拜托了  跟我谈谈
<9-14,CASTLE>Please, just talk to me.

202
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:29,230
<9-15,ESPOSITO>坐下  不然我要扣押你了
<9-15,ESPOSITO>Sit down, or I'll have to restrain you.

203
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:32,220
<9-16,CASTLE>我知道你在那  因为通常我都在你旁边
<9-16,CASTLE>I know you're in there, because usually I'm right beside you.

204
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,520
<9-17,BECKETT>卡塞尔先生  坐下
<9-17,BECKETT>Mr. Castle, sit down.

205
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,440
<9-18,BECKETT>我来处理
<9-18,BECKETT>I'll handle this.

206
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:42,960
<9-19,ESPOSITO>你确定吗  警监
<9-19,ESPOSITO>You sure, Captain?

207
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,970
<9-20,BECKETT>卡塞尔先生  我们暂时假设
<9-20,BECKETT>Mr. Castle, let's just say for a moment

208
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,840
<9-21,BECKETT>我们的确见过彼此吧
<9-21,BECKETT>that you and I did meet each other.

209
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,160
<9-21,BECKETT>我们在哪里见过
<9-21,BECKETT>Where would that have been?

210
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,650
<9-22,CASTLE>在我的签售会上  你来找我
<9-22,CASTLE>At my book party. You came to me.

211
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:58,990
<9-22,CASTLE>你向我咨询一件模仿谋杀案
<9-22,CASTLE>You asked me to consult on a copycat murder.

212
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:00,770
<9-22,CASTLE>就在六年前  当时你还是短发
<9-22,CASTLE>It was six years ago. Your hair was short then.

213
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:02,480
<9-22,CASTLE>短发的你很可爱
<9-22,CASTLE>It was adorable.

214
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:06,400
<9-23,BECKETT>六年前啊
<9-23,BECKETT>Six years ago, huh?

215
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:12,350
<9-23,BECKETT>资料上说和你见面的是麦克纳提警探
<9-23,BECKETT>Well, it says here that you met with a Detective McNulty.

216
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,640
<9-23,BECKETT>显然是你帮助他破了案子
<9-23,BECKETT>Apparently you helped him solve the case.

217
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,010
<9-24,CASTLE>不  凯特  是你
<9-24,CASTLE>No -- no, no, no. Kate, it was -- it was you.

00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,520
<9-24,CASTLE>好吧  今天早上我在你身边醒过来
<9-24,CASTLE>All right. Okay, I -- I woke up next to you this morning.

219
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:21,330
<9-24,CASTLE>这不是我幻想出来的
<9-24,CASTLE>I'm not imagining that.

220
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:23,630
<9-25,BECKETT>我很抱歉  卡塞尔先生
<9-25,BECKETT>I-I'm sorry, Mr. Castle.

221
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:26,070
<9-25,BECKETT>我们俩没有在交往
<9-25,BECKETT>We don't have a relationship.

222

<9-25,BECKETT>在今天之前  我们从没见过面
<9-25,BECKETT>Before today, you and I have never met.

223
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:32,600
<9-25,BECKETT>你想打电话叫谁来接你吗
<9-25,BECKETT>Now, is there someone that you would like to call?

<10-1,MARTHA>这个签名是送给谁的
<10-1,MARTHA>Who should I make this out to?

244
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,690
<10-19,CASTLE>显然非常非常嗨
<10-19,CASTLE>Apparently very, very hard.

245
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,400
<10-19,CASTLE>这可不是好事
<10-19,CASTLE>Oh, that can't be good.

246
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:29,420
<10-20,MARTHA>来吧  孩子  过来  亲爱的
<10-20,MARTHA>Come on, kiddo. Come on. Oh, dear.

247
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:34,170
<10-22,MARTHA>别担心  亲爱的
<10-22,MARTHA>Don't worry, darling.

248
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:36,660
<10-23,MARTHA>到家就好了
<10-23,MARTHA>Once you're home, you'll feel much better.

249
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,490
<11-1,CASTLE>天啊  母亲
<11-1,CASTLE>Oh, my god, mother!

250
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:41,820
<11-1,CASTLE>你把我家怎么了
<11-1,CASTLE>What have you done with my place?

251
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:45,640
<11-2,MARTHA>理查德  这事我们已经聊过了
<11-2,MARTHA>Oh, Richard. We have talked abou this!

252
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,620
<11-2,MARTHA>现在咱们是合缴贷款  这是咱俩的家
<11-2,MARTHA>Now that we share the mortgage, it is our place.

253
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:52,940
<11-2,MARTHA>而且  既然你的大部分存款都没了...
<11-2,MARTHA>And since you have lost most of your life savings...

254
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:54,970
<11-3,CASTLE>啥  存款没了  怎么没的
<11-3,CASTLE>Whoa! Lost my savings? How?

255
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:57,540
<11-4,MARTHA>你投资失败啊  大都花在美女和赛马上了
<11-4,MARTHA>You invested poorly... mostly blondes and racehorses.

256
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,560
<11-4,MARTHA>而且你这伟大的美国小说
<11-4,MARTHA>And it's not as if your great american novel here

257
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,430
<11-4,MARTHA>也没有多畅销
<11-4,MARTHA>is flying off the shelves.

258
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:05,140
<11-5,CASTLE>《有限之笑》  我没写过这书  这...
<11-5,CASTLE>"Finite laughter"? I did not write this. This...

259
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,780
<11-5,CASTLE>"巴布柯克是个小男人  有着大梦想的小男人
<11-5,CASTLE>"Babcock was a small man, a small man with large dreams,

260
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,830
<11-5,CASTLE>而其中的一个梦想就是贝蒂"  太烂了
<11-5,CASTLE>and one of those dreams was Betty." This is awful!

261
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:11,590
<11-6,MARTHA>评论家也是这么说的
<11-6,MARTHA>Exactly what the critics said.

262
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:15,360
<11-6,MARTHA>但我很高兴客观角度总算让你有点自知之明了
<11-6,MARTHA>But I am pleased to see that distance has given you some perspective.

263
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,800
<11-7,ALEXIS CASTLE>-很好  -爸
<11-7,ALEXIS CASTLE>- Good. - Oh, hey, dad.

264
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:18,980
<11-9,ALEXIS>看来你是保释了
<11-9,ALEXIS>I see you made bail.

265
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:21,650
<11-10,CASTLE>阿丽克西斯  你的头发  什么时候弄的
<11-10,CASTLE>Alexis, your hair! When did you do that?!

266
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:24,030
<11-11,ALEXIS>三年前
<11-11,ALEXIS>Uh, three years ago.

267
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,690
<11-11,ALEXIS>-我搬去洛杉矶之前就弄了  -洛杉矶
<11-11,ALEXIS>- Before I moved to L.A. - L.A.?!

268
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:30,140
<11-12,CASTLE>理查德  别找茬  阿丽克西斯就回来待几天
<11-12,CASTLE>Richard, don't start. Alexis is here for a few days.

269
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:32,010
<11-13,MARTHA>她可是专程从拯救世界的大业中抽出时间
<11-13,MARTHA>She's taking time off from saving the world

270
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:34,450
<11-13,MARTHA>-来参加我的开幕之夜的  -够了
<11-13,MARTHA>- to come to my opening night. - Okay.

271
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:36,780
<11-14,CASTLE>好吧  够了
<11-14,CASTLE>Okay, that's it.

272
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,260
<11-14,CASTLE>够了  我受够了
<11-14,CASTLE>That's it. I'm done.

273
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:41,400
<11-15,ALEXIS>奶奶  他没事吧
<11-15,ALEXIS>Grandma, is he ok?

274
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,880
<11-16,MARTHA>他昨晚过得不容易
<11-16,MARTHA>He had a rough night.

275
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,940
<11-18,CASTLE>不管这都是怎么回事
<11-18,CASTLE>Whatever... all this is,

276
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,570
<11-18,CASTLE>昏迷  做梦  或是什么诡异的幻觉
<11-18,CASTLE>Coma, a dream, wired hallucination,

277
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:53,930
<11-18,CASTLE>就算只是披萨消化不良
<11-18,CASTLE>Or, even just a undigested pisa

278
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,580
<11-18,CASTLE>我要结束这一切
<11-18,CASTLE>I'm ending it.

279
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:03,350
<11-19,CASTLE>该醒醒了
<11-19,CASTLE>It's time to wake up.

280
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,840
<11-19,CASTLE>我不明白
<11-19,CASTLE>I don't understand.

281
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,430
<11-20,CASTLE>我以前从没做过这样的梦
<11-20,CASTLE>I've never had a dream like this before.

282
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:18,840
<11-20,CASTLE>-我怎么还没醒  -也许这不是梦
<11-20,CASTLE>- Why aren't I waking up? - Maybe it's not a dream.

283
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,390
<11-21,ALEXIS>也许你穿越到什么平行宇宙里去了
<11-21,ALEXIS>Maybe you traveled into some alternate universe.

284
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:23,390
<11-22,MARTHA>阿丽克西斯  别讽刺你老爸
<11-22,MARTHA>Oh, Alexis, don't tease your father.

285
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:25,150
<11-22,MARTHA>亲爱的  要不你去躺会儿吧
<11-22,MARTHA>Darling, Maybe you'd just better lie down.

286
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,640
<11-23,CASTLE>对  可能真该躺会儿
<11-23,CASTLE>Yeah, maybe I should.

291
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,270
<12-1,CHELSEA>小查德
<12-1,CHELSEA>Hey, Richie.

292
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,600
<12-1,CHELSEA>照你说的  我用了你藏的钥匙
<12-1,CHELSEA>I used your hidden key like you said.

293
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,330
<12-2,CASTLE>你是谁
<12-2,CASTLE>Who are you?

294
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:51,430
<12-3,CHELSEA>要玩这个游戏吗
<12-3,CHELSEA>Oh, is that what we're playing?

295
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,320
<12-3,CHELSEA>好啊
<12-3,CHELSEA>Okay. Oh!

296
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:54,970
<12-3,CHELSEA>我在汽车站看到了你  先生
<12-3,CHELSEA>I saw you at the bus stop, mister,

297
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:56,320
<12-3,CHELSEA>于是便尾随你回了家
<12-3,CHELSEA>And I followed you home.

298
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,830
<12-4,CASTLE>好吧  显然我们认识  切尔西吗
<12-4,CASTLE>Okay, obviously we know each other...Chelsea?

299
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:00,680
<12-5,CHELSEA>真是我人生中最快乐的两周
<12-5,CHELSEA>Oh, it was the funnest two weeks of my life.

300
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,950
<12-6,CASTLE>好吧  说真的  我...
<12-6,CASTLE>Okay, real...I... oh, I...

301
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,970
<12-7,CHELSEA>-我真不行  -你当然行  你行的
<12-7,CHELSEA>- I-I really can't do this. - Sure, you can. Sure, you can.

302
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,860
<12-7,CHELSEA>我包里有几片伟哥
<12-7,CHELSEA>I got a couple little blue pills in my purse.

303
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:09,150
<12-8,CASTLE>哦不不  我是说  不...
<12-8,CASTLE>Oh. No... no, I mean... no, I just... I, uh...

304
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:11,060
<12-8,CASTLE>我得继续工作了
<12-8,CASTLE>I-I have to get back to work.

305
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:14,270
<12-8,CASTLE>听着  你看起来是个可爱的年轻的...
<12-8,CASTLE>Look, you seem like a... a lovely young... mm?

306
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:18,950
<12-8,CASTLE>非常年轻的女人  可我想你该走了
<12-8,CASTLE>Young woman, but I-I-I, um, I think you should go.

307
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:21,900
<12-9,CHELSEA>真的假的
<12-9,CHELSEA>Seriously?

308
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:25,220
<12-9,CHELSEA>你们这些作家还真奇怪
<12-9,CHELSEA>You writers are so strange.

310
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,400
<12-10,MAN>就好像突然之间  我穿过了一扇门
<12-10,MAN>It was like suddenly I waed through a doorway

311
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:43,220
<12-10,MAN>那边的人我都认识  可一切都不一样了
<12-10,MAN>where I knew everyone, but everything was different.

312
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:46,140
<12-10,MAN>我老婆嫁给了别的男人
<12-10,MAN>My wife was married to another man.

313
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:51,110
<12-11,WOMAN>我回到家  我父母都没认出我来
<12-11,WOMAN>I came back home, and my parents didn't recognize me.

314
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:52,260
<12-11,WOMAN>他们根本不认识我
<12-11,WOMAN>They didn't know me.

318
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:10,330
<13-1,MARTHA>早上好  亲爱的
<13-1,MARTHA>Well, good morning, darling.

319
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,600
<13-1,MARTHA>今天感觉好点了吗
<13-1,MARTHA>Are you feeling better today?

320
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:13,390
<13-2,CASTLE>好多了  我知道是怎么回事了
<13-2,CASTLE>Much, because I know what's going on.

321
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:15,990
<13-2,CASTLE>我知道我为什么在这里了  是这个
<13-2,CASTLE>I know why I'm here. It's this.

322
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:19,600
<13-3,MARTHA>"瑞士考古团队发现了古印加人手工艺品"
<13-3,MARTHA>"Swi archaeological team discovers ancient incan artifact"?

323
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:22,430
<13-4,CASTLE>不是随便什么手工艺品  从记号来看
<13-4,CASTLE>Not just any artifact. Given its markings,

324
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:24,580
<13-4,CASTLE>一些神秘主义者相信
<13-4,CASTLE>some mystics believe that it's connected

325
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,310
<13-4,CASTLE>它与印加人通往诸神之地的大门有关
<13-4,CASTLE>to the incan gateway to the gods,

326
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:27,540
<13-4,CASTLE>通过那扇门  萨满教巫师
<13-4,CASTLE>A doorway through which shamans

327
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,250
<13-4,CASTLE>可以穿越到另一个时空去
<13-4,CASTLE>were known to travel into other rea.

328
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,850
<13-5,ALEXIS>老爸  我那是开玩笑的
<13-5,ALEXIS>Dad, I was joking.

329
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:32,360
<13-5,ALEXIS>别告诉我你相信这些
<13-5,ALEXIS>Please don't tell me you believe this.

330
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:34,650
<13-5,ALEXIS>阿莱克西斯  我当时就拿着它
<13-5,ALEXIS>Alexis, I was holding this.

331
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:37,520
<13-6,CASTLE>就在那时候
<13-6,CASTLE>And at right at the moment,

332
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,880
<13-6,CASTLE>手榴弹滚到了我们之间
<13-6,CASTLE>as the grenade was rolling between us,

333
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,250
<13-6,CASTLE>我在想  也许我配不上她
<13-6,CASTLE>I was thinking maybe I wasn't good for her.

334
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,660
<13-6,CASTLE>如果我们从未相遇  贝克特也许会过得更好
<13-6,CASTLE>Maybe Beckett would be happier if we had never met.

335
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:51,270
<13-6,CASTLE>就是这个发生了改变  这就是我所在的世界
<13-6,CASTLE>That's what changed. That's where I am...

336
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:52,670
<13-6,CASTLE>一个我们从未相遇过的世界
<13-6,CASTLE>In a world where we never met.

337
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:54,100
<13-6,CASTLE>就好像过去的六年从未发生过
<13-6,CASTLE>It's like the last six years didn't happen.

338
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,300
<13-7,ALEXIS>贝克特是谁
<13-7,ALEXIS>Who... who's Beckett?

339
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,500
<13-8,CASTLE>没错  你不知道她是谁
<13-8,CASTLE>Exactly. You don't know who she is,

340
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,560
<13-8,CASTLE>因为我们从未相遇  我也没写过妮奇·希特小说
<13-8,CASTLE>Because she and I never met, so I didn't write "Nikki heat,"

341
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,970
<13-8,CASTLE>我只写出了那堆垃圾
<13-8,CASTLE>I wrote that godawful piece of trash instead,

342
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:03,300
<13-8,CASTLE>由于收入很少
<13-8,CASTLE>and with less money coming in,

343
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,530
<13-8,CASTLE>你不得不去外面打拼  追求成功
<13-8,CASTLE>you were forced to go out and be successful.

344
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,780
<13-9,MARTHA>我成功是因为我有才
<13-9,MARTHA>I found success because of my boundless talent.

345
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:10,220
<13-10,CASTLE>-而出于某种原因  我们疏远了  -某种原因
<13-10,CASTLE>- And somehow we drifted apart. - Somehow?

346
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,070
<13-12,CASTLE>不是我疯了  只是这里不是我的世界
<13-12,CASTLE>I'm not crazy. This is not my world.

347
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:14,550
<13-13,MARTHA>-我要回家  -你要怎么回
<13-13,MARTHA>- I need to get back home. - How do you intend to do that?

348
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,470
<13-14,CASTLE>我要帮这个世界的贝克特找到那个工艺品
<13-14,CASTLE>By helping this world's Beckett find that artifact

349
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:19,980
<13-14,CASTLE>这样我就能回到我的现实了
<13-14,CASTLE>so I can get back to my reality.

350
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:22,040
<13-15,ALEXIS>所以我才和妈妈住
<13-15,ALEXIS>This is why I live with mom.

351
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,540
<14-1,CASTLE>原来你是我的粉丝啊
<14-1,CASTLE>So you're a fan.

352
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,220
<14-1,CASTLE>我还以为你不知道我呢
<14-1,CASTLE>And here I thought you didn't know me.

353
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,300
<14-2,BECKETT>我不知道  我是说之前不知道
<14-2,BECKETT>Yeah, I don't. I mean, I didn't. I --

354
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,340
<14-3,CASTLE>你没认出来那个神经错乱的我吧
<14-3,CASTLE>Didn't recognize me in my deranged state?

355
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:35,620
<14-3,CASTLE>我应该道歉
<14-3,CASTLE>Listen... I have to apologize.

356
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:37,890
<14-3,CASTLE>我的所作所为肯定让你以为我是疯了
<14-3,CASTLE>How I acted, you must have thought I was crazy.

357
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:40,210
<14-4,BECKETT>没错  因为你就是疯了
<14-4,BECKETT>Well, yeah, that's because you were.

358
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:42,980
<14-5,CASTLE>这是因为我正在写的一本新书
<14-5,CASTLE>Yeah. It's this new book I've been working on.

359
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:45,180
<14-5,CASTLE>我一直在创作
<14-5,CASTLE>I have been working nonstop.

360
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,760
<14-5,CASTLE>我不停的喝咖啡
<14-5,CASTLE>I mean, I have been drinking coffee,

361
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,540
<14-5,CASTLE>吃安定  我都几天没睡了
<14-5,CASTLE>popping NoDoz, I haven't slept in days,

362
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,990
<14-5,CASTLE>而且更糟的是
<14-5,CASTLE>and to make matters worse...

363
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,710
<14-5,CASTLE>书里有个新人物  是以你为原型塑造的
<14-5,CASTLE>There's a new character. I-I kind of based her on you.

364
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,440
<14-5,CASTLE>根据我从新闻上对你的了解
<14-5,CASTLE>What I -- what I read about you.

365
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,940
<14-5,CASTLE>她聪明机智  发奋图强
<14-5,CASTLE>So she's savvy and smart and driven,

366
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,780
<14-5,CASTLE>而且我爱上了她
<14-5,CASTLE>and I have fallen in love with her.

367
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:02,900
<14-5,CASTLE>我和她一起吃饭  睡觉
<14-5,CASTLE>I mean, I eat with her, I sleep with her --

368
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,270
<14-5,CASTLE>但我知道了  你不是她
<14-5,CASTLE>but I know you are not her.

369
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,760
<14-6,BECKETT>这些都不能解释
<14-6,BECKETT>You know, none of this explains

370
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,000
<14-6,BECKETT>你为什么对案发现场如此了解
<14-6,BECKETT>how you know so much about the crime scene.

371
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,020
<14-7,CASTLE>我有个警用电台
<14-7,CASTLE>I have a police scanner,

372
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,780
<14-7,CASTLE>我在跟进这件案子
<14-7,CASTLE>and I was tracking the investigation.

373
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,670
<14-7,CASTLE>事实上  这正是我来的原因  警监
<14-7,CASTLE>Actually, that's why I'm here, captain.

374
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:17,130
<14-7,CASTLE>我知道手提箱里装的什么
<14-7,CASTLE>I know what was in the briefcase,

375
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:18,260
<14-7,CASTLE>我知道它去了哪
<14-7,CASTLE>I know where it's going,

376
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,530
<14-7,CASTLE>而且我想我知道是谁拿的
<14-7,CASTLE>and I think I know who took it.

377
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:20,480
<14-8,BECKETT>你怎么知道的
<14-8,BECKETT>And how do you know all that?

378
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,370
<14-9,CASTLE>说来话长  但我真知道
<14-9,CASTLE>It's complicated, but... I do.

379
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:24,650
<14-9,CASTLE>警监
<14-9,CASTLE>Hey, captain.

380
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,060
<14-10,RYAN>他来这儿干嘛
<14-10,RYAN>What's he doing here?

381
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,240
<14-11,BECKETT>我不知道
<14-11,BECKETT>I'm not sure.

382
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,020
<14-12,RYAN>好吧  快递公司回复了
<14-12,RYAN>Okay. So, uh, I heard back from the courier company.

383
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,790
<14-12,RYAN>原来死者是在运送一件
<14-12,RYAN>Turns out our victim was transporting --

384
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,530
<14-13,CASTLE>古老的印加工艺品
<14-13,CASTLE>An ancient incan artifact.

385
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,920
<14-14,RYAN>没错  而且是要送去
<14-14,RYAN>Yeah. And, uh, it was on its way --

386
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,360
<14-15,CASTLE>纽约帕利塞兹的
<14-15,CASTLE>To the lamont-doherty laboratories

387
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,230
<14-15,CASTLE>拉蒙-多哈堤实验室做研究
<14-15,CASTLE>in palisades, new york, for study.

388
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:44,680
<14-15,CASTLE>科学家认为它是陨石打造的
<14-15,CASTLE>Scientists believe it was fashioned from a meteorite,

389
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,840
<14-15,CASTLE>但是传统扫描仪都无法穿透它
<14-15,CASTLE>but it's proven impenetrable to conventional scans.

390
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,470
<14-15,CASTLE>我怎么知道的
<14-15,CASTLE>How did I know all this?

391
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:53,160
<14-15,CASTLE>我当过犯罪小说家  现在也有些线人
<14-15,CASTLE>I used to be a crime novelist, and I still have a few sources.

392
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:56,710
<14-15,CASTLE>警监  死者就是因为它被杀的
<14-15,CASTLE>Captain, this is what your victims were killed for.

393
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,060
<14-16,BECKETT>为什么会有人为这东西杀人
<14-16,BECKETT>And why would someone kill for this?

394
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,690
<14-17,RYAN>实验室的人说这样的古董
<14-17,RYAN>Well, the folks at the lab said an object like that

395
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,500
<14-17,RYAN>对收藏家来说是无价之宝
<14-17,RYAN>would be invaluable to any collector.

396
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:08,220
<14-18,BECKETT>卡塞尔先生  你说你知道是谁拿走了它
<14-18,BECKETT>Mr. Castle, you said that you might know who took it.

397
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:11,020
<14-19,CASTLE>我虽然不确定那人是谁
<14-19,CASTLE>Not exactly who, but...

398
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:13,450
<14-19,CASTLE>但我知道与谁有关
<14-19,CASTLE>I know who was involved.

399
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:17,340
<15-1,CASTLE>租赁车要去接甘斯勒
<15-1,CASTLE>So the car service was going to pick up Gensler,

400
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:19,000
<15-1,CASTLE>即是送货员  接人的地点是这里的机场
<15-1,CASTLE>the courier, from the airport here,

401
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,260
<15-1,CASTLE>送他去这里的实验室  基本是向北的
<15-1,CASTLE>take him to the lab here -- basically north.

402
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,240
<15-1,CASTLE>但出于某种原因  他们被袭击时
<15-1,CASTLE>Yet for some reason, when they were attacked,

403
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,350
<15-1,CASTLE>-却在西班牙哈莱姆区  -反方向
<15-1,CASTLE>- they ended up here in Spanish Harlem. - The opposite way.

404
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,290
<15-3,CASTLE>没错  所以要么是司机
<15-3,CASTLE>Yes. So either this driver

405
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:31,770
<15-3,CASTLE>毫无方向感可言
<15-3,CASTLE>had a terrible sense of direction...

406
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:32,610
<15-4,BECKETT>要么就是司机参与了其中
<15-4,BECKETT>Or he was in on it.

407
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:35,110
<15-5,CASTLE>也许是他的同伴杀他是为灭口
<15-5,CASTLE>And maybe his partners killed him to silence him.

408
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,830
<15-6,BECKETT>莱恩警探  去详细调查这个司机
<15-6,BECKETT>Detective Ryan, get me everything you can on that driver.

409
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:45,630
<15-7,BECKETT>你帮了大忙  卡塞尔先生
<15-7,BECKETT>That was surprisingly helpful, Mr. Castle.

410
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,500
<15-8,CASTLE>我可不可以  在这儿待着
<15-8,CASTLE>Do you mind if I... hang around,

411
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,950
<15-8,CASTLE>-跟进一下案件  -休息室在那边
<15-8,CASTLE>- see how this turns out? - Mm-hmm. Breakroom's over there.

412
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:50,950
<15-10,CASTLE>我知道
<15-10,CASTLE>I know.

413
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:03,640
<16-1,ESPOSITO>写东西的  告诉我
<16-1,ESPOSITO>Yo, writer boy, tell me how you know

414
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,410
<16-1,ESPOSITO>-你怎么知道燃煤工厂的事的  -什么
<16-1,ESPOSITO>- about that coal plant. - What?

415
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:08,140
<16-3,ESPOSITO>就是你昨天来时提到的那个
<16-3,ESPOSITO>The one you were talking about when you came in yesterday.

416
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,840
<16-3,ESPOSITO>警监让我来问问你
<16-3,ESPOSITO>Captain had me check it out.

417
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:11,960
<16-3,ESPOSITO>你知道我发现了什么吗
<16-3,ESPOSITO>You know what I found?

418
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:14,780
<16-4,ESPOSITO>轮胎印
<16-4,ESPOSITO>Tire tracks.

419
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:17,750
<16-4,ESPOSITO>和我们在案发现场发现的轮胎印一模一样
<16-4,ESPOSITO>The same tire tracks that we found at our crime scene.

420
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,820
<16-4,ESPOSITO>你知道犯人把那里当作
<16-4,ESPOSITO>Now, you knew that our doers were using it

421
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,100
<16-4,ESPOSITO>中转站  而你知道的唯一原因
<16-4,ESPOSITO>as a staging ground, and the only way

422
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,850
<16-4,ESPOSITO>就是因为你有参与其中
<16-4,ESPOSITO>you would know that is if you were involved.

423
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:25,880
<16-5,CASTLE>好吧  我一般不会告诉别人的  不过
<16-5,CASTLE>Okay, fine. I don't usually like to tell people this,

424
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:28,160
<16-5,CASTLE>我有超能力
<16-5,CASTLE>but I have a gift.

425
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,670
<16-6,ESPOSITO>-我能看出一些事  -看出一些事
<16-6,ESPOSITO>- I know things. - You know things?

426
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:33,130
<16-7,CASTLE>你我昨天是第一次见面没错吧
<16-7,CASTLE>You and I haven't met before yesterday, correct?

427
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:34,550
<16-8,ESPOSITO>-没错  -那我是怎么能知道
<16-8,ESPOSITO>- Yeah. - So then how would I know

428
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:36,160
<16-9,CASTLE>你喜欢一个女人
<16-9,CASTLE>that you had a thing with a woman

429
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:39,150
<16-9,CASTLE>她姓名的缩写是L.P.
<16-9,CASTLE>whose initials were... L.P.?

430
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,180
<16-9,CASTLE>而且我又怎么知道
<16-9,CASTLE>And how would I know that

431
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,870
<16-9,CASTLE>她走向了下段感情你却放不下呢
<16-9,CASTLE>she moved on and you can't?

432
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:46,100
<16-10,ESPOSITO>莱恩就是个大嘴巴  是他告诉你的
<16-10,ESPOSITO>Ryan has a big, fat mouth. That's how you know.

433
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,680
<16-11,CASTLE>怎么回事呢  不敢做出承诺吗
<16-11,CASTLE>What happened? Commitment issues?

434
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:53,860
<16-12,RYAN>哥们  有新发现
<16-12,RYAN>Hey, man. We got something.

435
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:01,260
<17-1,RYAN>在他被杀前四天里
<17-1,RYAN>Okay, so over the last four days before he was killed,

436
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,490
<17-1,RYAN>司机曾经
<17-1,RYAN>our driver made a --

437
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:10,720
<17-2,RYAN>司机曾经多次打给
<17-2,RYAN>Our driver made a series of phone calls

438
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,150
<17-2,RYAN>一家餐厅里的公用电话
<17-2,RYAN>to a pay phone located inside of a restaurant.

439
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:15,590
<17-2,RYAN>问题在于  那家店已经
<17-2,RYAN>The only problem is, the place has been shut down

440
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,080
<17-3,ESPOSITO>-关门好几个月了  -他要打给谁
<17-3,ESPOSITO>- the past couple of months. - Who was he calling?

441
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,440
<17-4,RYAN>不知道  不过看这个
<17-4,RYAN>I have no idea, but check it out --

442
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,140
<17-4,RYAN>那家废弃餐厅   鸟人
<17-4,RYAN>The deserted restaurant, El Chozo,

443
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,300
<17-4,RYAN>也许就是他想去的地方
<17-4,RYAN>maybe that's where he was headed.

444
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,140
<17-4,RYAN>离SUV被袭击的地点不远
<17-4,RYAN>It's right near where the S.U.V. was attacked.

445
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:25,290
<17-5,BECKETT>好吧  去那看看  找找线索
<17-5,BECKETT>All right, get up there. See what you can find.

446
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:28,720
<17-6,CASTLE>警监  我能不能跟着一起去
<17-6,CASTLE>Uh, captain, would it be possible for me to ride along?

447
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,220
<17-6,CASTLE>-只是为写书做点研究  -他开玩笑吗
<17-6,CASTLE>- Uh, strictly for research purposes. - Is he kidding?

448
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,050
<17-8,CASTLE>我只是不愿错过观察的机会
<17-8,CASTLE>I would just love the chance to observe,

449
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:34,580
<17-8,CASTLE>为我的书收集点细节素材
<17-8,CASTLE>get some details for my book.

450
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,880
<17-9,RYAN>警监  我们可以带着他
<17-9,RYAN>Yeah, sure, cap, we'll take him along.

451
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,060
<17-10,ESPOSITO>-搞什么啊  -他是玛莎·罗杰斯的儿子
<17-10,ESPOSITO>- What the... - Dude, that's Martha Rodgers' son.

452
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,210
<17-11,RYAN>他可以给我们弄到贵宾票
<17-11,RYAN>He can get us house seats.

453
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:41,740
<17-11,RYAN>-你能弄到贵宾票对吧  -没  问题
<17-11,RYAN>- You can get us house seats, right? - Ab...solutely.

454
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,280
<17-13,BECKETT>好吧  但是要听话  不要碍事
<17-13,BECKETT>Okay. But do as they say and don't interfere.

455
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,870
<17-13,BECKETT>好了  走吧我的贵宾票
<17-13,BECKETT>Come on. Let's go, house seats.

456
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:47,710
<18-1,CASTLE>你们警监
<18-1,CASTLE>So the captain --

457
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,630
<18-1,CASTLE>她有男朋友吗
<18-1,CASTLE>is she seeing anyone?

458
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:51,880
<18-2,RYAN>谈过几个  没有到认真的地步
<18-2,RYAN>She has boyfriends. Nothing serious.

459
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,500
<18-3,ESPOSITO>怎么  作家小子
<18-3,ESPOSITO>Why, writer boy?

460
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,300
<18-3,ESPOSITO>你难道觉得自己有机会追到她
<18-3,ESPOSITO>What, you think you have a chance with her?

461
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:56,920
<18-3,ESPOSITO>还有你都干了些什么
<18-3,ESPOSITO>And what are you doing,

462
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,140
<18-3,ESPOSITO>竟然口无遮拦地对外人说别人的私生活
<18-3,ESPOSITO>telling crazy over here about everyone's private life?

00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,370
<18-4,RYAN>-我吗  -对
<18-4,RYAN>- Me? - Yeah.

<18-7,CASTLE>I look at people, and I see things.

469
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,550
<18-8,RYAN>你看看我  能看出什么来
<18-8,RYAN>What do you see when you look at me?

470
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,640
<18-9,CASTLE>蜂蜜牛奶和雀斑
<18-9,CASTLE>Honeymilk and freckles.

471
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,300
<18-9,CASTLE>不是吧
<18-9,CASTLE>No!

472
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,510
<18-10,RYAN>是珍妮·奥马利
<18-10,RYAN>That's Jenny O'malley.

473
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:20,140
<18-10,RYAN>是的  她以前经常给我做蜂蜜牛奶
<18-10,RYAN>Yeah, she used to make me honeymilk.

474
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:22,280
<18-10,RYAN>她本来会成为我的妻子
<18-10,RYAN>She could have been the one.

475
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,810
<18-11,CASTLE>-本来会  -是的
<18-11,CASTLE>- Could have? - Yeah...

476
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:27,430
<18-12,RYAN>贝克特升任警监后  我们的案子数量翻了倍
<18-12,RYAN>Well, when Beckett was promoted to captain, our caseload doubled.

477
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:29,530
<18-12,RYAN>我没时间陪她
<18-12,RYAN>I guess I-I never had time for her.

478
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:32,390
<18-13,CASTLE>或许你应该给她打个电话
<18-13,CASTLE>Maybe you should give her a call.

479
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,410
<18-14,ESPOSITO>或许你应该管好你自己的事
<18-14,ESPOSITO>Maybe you should mind your own business.

480
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:42,660
<19-1,ESPOSITO>好了  听好规矩
<19-1,ESPOSITO>All right. Here are the rules --

481
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,230
<19-1,ESPOSITO>待在车里  否则我就向你开枪  明白了吗
<19-1,ESPOSITO>Stay in the car, or I shoot you. Got it?

482
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:48,340
<19-2,CASTLE>能给我留个窗缝吗
<19-2,CASTLE>You want to crack a window for me?

483
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:00,270
<20-1,ESPOSITO>简直不敢相信警监让我们照顾这蠢货
<20-1,ESPOSITO>I can't believe the captain's making us babysit this nutjob.

484
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:01,170
<20-1,ESPOSITO>他还好啦
<20-1,ESPOSITO>He's not so bad.

486
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,780
<20-1,ESPOSITO>太棒了
<20-1,ESPOSITO>Oh, yes.

487
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:36,620
<21-1,CASTLE>好了
<21-1,CASTLE>Okay...

488
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:38,890
<21-2,CASTLE>带我回家
<21-2,CASTLE>Take me home.

489
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,030
<21-2,CASTLE>要显灵啊
<21-2,CASTLE>Come on...

490
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:49,560
<21-2,CASTLE>交出来  否则就杀了你
<21-2,CASTLE>Hand it over, or you die.

491
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,510
<22-1,MARIA>谁派你来的  你都知道什么
<22-1,MARIA>Who sent you? What do you know?

492
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:57,310
<22-2,CASTLE>没人派我来  没人  是它送我来的
<22-2,CASTLE>Nobody sent me. Nobody. It just -- this -- it sent me.

493
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:01,350
<22-2,CASTLE>这个东西  是它  我看到了一束蓝光
<22-2,CASTLE>The object, it sent me. I saw a blue light,

494
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,780
<22-2,CASTLE>然后我就来这了
<22-2,CASTLE>and I ended up here.

495
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,750
<22-3,RYAN>纽约警察  马上把刀放下
<22-3,RYAN>NYPD! Dropour knife now!

496
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:06,960
<22-4,CASTLE>不要
<22-4,CASTLE>No!

497
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:13,950
<22-5,RYAN>搞什么  伙计
<22-5,RYAN>What the hell, man?

498
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,270
<22-5,RYAN>你应该在车里等着的
<22-5,RYAN>You were supposed to wait in the car.

499
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:17,190
<22-6,CASTLE>还有关系吗  都碎了
<22-6,CASTLE>What does it matter now? It's broken!

500
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:19,490
<22-6,CASTLE>我回不了家了
<22-6,CASTLE>Now I'm never getting home.

501
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,760
<22-6,CASTLE>一辈子都被困在这了
<22-6,CASTLE>Now I'm stuck here in this life.

502
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:26,300
<22-6,CASTLE>可真的那个是不会碎的
<22-6,CASTLE>But the real one would never...break.

503
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,440
<22-6,CASTLE>这是个假的  这是个假的
<22-6,CASTLE>This is a fake! This is a fake.

504
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:31,180
<22-6,CASTLE>你从哪得到的  真的在哪里
<22-6,CASTLE>Where did you get this, and where's the real one?

505
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,490
<22-7,ESPOSITO>把他也拷上
<22-7,ESPOSITO>Cuff him, too.

506
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,760
<23-1,BECKETT>你觉得你在做什么
<23-1,BECKETT>What the hell do you think you were doing?

507
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,430
<23-1,BECKETT>你会害死自己的
<23-1,BECKETT>You could have gotten yourself killed.

508
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:41,920
<23-2,CASTLE>我有后援  而且我的确帮忙抓到了嫌犯
<23-2,CASTLE>I had backup. And I did help capture a suspect.

509
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:44,420
<23-3,BECKETT>不  你应该只是随行  在一边观望
<23-3,BECKETT>No, you were supposed to accompany and observe,

510
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,290
<23-3,BECKETT>-而不是参与和...  -干扰
<23-3,BECKETT>- not participate and... - Annoy.

511
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,700
<23-5,BECKETT>让我的人身处险境
<23-5,BECKETT>Risk my people's lives.

512
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,160
<23-5,BECKETT>经过上午的闹剧后
<23-5,BECKETT>Now, after this morning's antics,

513
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,940
<23-5,BECKETT>我希望你能表现得好一些
<23-5,BECKETT>I expected you to be on your best behavior.

514
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:53,150
<23-6,CASTLE>-其实  我已经表现得很好了  -什么事
<23-6,CASTLE>- Actually, that kind of is my best behavior. - What?

515
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:55,090
<23-7,BECKETT>我只是在欣赏你们的争论
<23-7,BECKETT>Oh, I'm just enjoying the show.

516
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,720
<23-8,ESPOSITO>嫌犯名字是玛利亚·桑切斯
<23-8,ESPOSITO>Our suspect's name is Maria Sanchez.

517
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:00,590
<23-8,ESPOSITO>她被秘鲁政府通缉了
<23-8,ESPOSITO>She's wanted by the Peruvian government

518
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:02,560
<23-8,ESPOSITO>跟政府大楼的爆炸案有关
<23-8,ESPOSITO>in connection with the bombings at a government building,

519
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:06,020
<23-8,ESPOSITO>还有偷窃和非法交易手工艺品
<23-8,ESPOSITO>not to mention the theft and trafficking of stolen artifacts.

520
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:08,240
<23-9,CASTLE>那就是她了  她是幕后黑手
<23-9,CASTLE>Then that's her, and she's behind it.

521
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,160
<23-9,CASTLE>我们得跟她谈谈
<23-9,CASTLE>We need to talk to her.

522
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,270
<23-10,BECKETT>不  卡塞尔先生  是他们去跟她谈
<23-10,BECKETT>No, Mr. Castle, they need to talk to her.

523
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:13,080
<23-10,BECKETT>你该回家了  这案子没你的事了
<23-10,BECKETT>You need to go home. You're done with this case.

524
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,710
<23-12,BECKETT>-但  -我没因为妨碍执法拘捕你  算你走运
<23-12,BECKETT>- But... - You're lucky I don't arrest you for obstruction.

525
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:18,500
<23-12,BECKETT>警官  请送卡塞尔先生进电梯
<23-12,BECKETT>Officer, please escort Mr. Castle to the elevator.

526
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,280
<23-12,BECKETT>-我希望他离开  -你不明白
<23-12,BECKETT>- I want him gone. - You don't understand.

527
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:22,390
<23-13,CASTLE>我需要找到这个手工艺品
<23-13,CASTLE>I need to find this artifact.

528
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:24,340
<23-13,CASTLE>贝克特  求你了
<23-13,CASTLE>Beckett! Please!

529
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:32,500
<23-14,BECKETT>什么事  埃斯波西托警探
<23-14,BECKETT>Yes, Detective Esposito?

530
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:34,160
<23-15,ESPOSITO>你不会让他影响到你吧
<23-15,ESPOSITO>You're not letting him get to him, are you?

531
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,500
<23-16,BECKETT>你不是还有案子要破吗
<23-16,BECKETT>Don't you have a case to close?

532
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,290
<24-1,MARIA>你们管这叫走私
<24-1,MARIA>You call it smuggling.

533
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:19,480
<24-1,MARIA>我们这是把自己的东西拿回来
<24-1,MARIA>We call it taking back our rightful legacy.

534
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,550
<24-1,MARIA>那件手工品在我们萨满教的人看来是很神圣的
<24-1,MARIA>That artifact was considered divine by our Shamans

535
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:24,300
<24-1,MARIA>而且是属于我们印加人的
<24-1,MARIA>and belongs to the Incan people.

536
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,350
<25-1,RYAN>为了这个东西值得杀死两个人吗
<25-1,RYAN>Was that legacy worth the lives of two men?

537
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:27,640
<25-2,MARIA>不  计划不是这样的
<25-2,MARIA>No, that wasn't the plan.

538
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,410
<25-3,RYAN>那计划是什么样的  玛利亚
<25-3,RYAN>Then what was the plan, Maria?

539
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:32,690
<25-3,RYAN>快点  直接问她那工艺品在哪就行了
<25-3,RYAN>Come on. Just ask where the artifact is.

540
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:35,380
<25-3,RYAN>我的堂兄  伦佐  他是司机
<25-3,RYAN>My cousin Renzo -- he was the driver.

541
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:38,060
<25-3,RYAN>他在送货人的水里放了镇定剂
<25-3,RYAN>He put sedatives in the courier's water

542
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,260
<27-1,MARIA>好让他昏迷过去
<27-1,MARIA>to knock him out.

543
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:41,290
<27-1,MARIA>甘斯勒睡着后  我们就会把他
<27-1,MARIA>Once Gensler was asleep, we were going to

544
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,610
<27-1,MARIA>带到饭店  然后把手提箱调包
<27-1,MARIA>bring him to the restaurant and switch the cases.

545
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:45,260
<27-1,MARIA>没人会受伤
<27-1,MARIA>No one was supposed to get hurt.

546
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:48,150
<27-1,MARIA>但有人袭击了他们  拿走了它
<27-1,MARIA>But someone attacked them. Someone else took it.

547
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:49,600
<28-1,CASTLE>你不知道它在哪
<28-1,CASTLE>You don't know where it is?

548
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,830
<28-1,CASTLE>袭击发生在离饭店不远的地方
<28-1,CASTLE>That attack happened just a few blocks from the restaurant.

549
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:53,500
<28-1,CASTLE>他们怎么知道车会去那
<28-1,CASTLE>How did they know the car was gonna be there?

550
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:55,570
<28-1,CASTLE>还有谁知道这事  玛利亚
<28-1,CASTLE>Who else was involved, Maria?

551
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:58,020
<29-1,RYAN>除了你和伦佐
<29-1,RYAN>Who else besides you and Renzo

552
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,830
<29-1,RYAN>还有谁知道更改了线路
<29-1,RYAN>knew about the change in route?

553
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:00,900
<29-2,MARIA>没人
<29-2,MARIA>No one.

554
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:04,530
<30-1,MARIA>除了机场那个人
<30-1,MARIA>Except the guy at the airport.

555
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,650
<30-2,CASTLE>-什么人  -什么人
<30-2,CASTLE>- What guy? - What guy?

556
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:09,150
<30-2,CASTLE>只有伦佐接到甘斯勒这个计划才能成功
<30-2,CASTLE>The plan only worked if Renzo made the pickup.

557
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:11,920
<31-1,RYAN>但是送货人用的是另一家公司的租车服务
<31-1,RYAN>But the courier, Gensler, was using another car service.

558
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:14,570
<31-2,MARIA>所以我们贿赂了私人飞机航站楼的迎宾员
<31-2,MARIA>So we paid the concierge at the private jet terminal

559
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:16,090
<31-2,MARIA>让他更改了租车公司
<31-2,MARIA>to change limo companies.

560
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:17,480
<31-2,MARIA>可能他告诉了别人
<31-2,MARIA>Maybe he told someone.

561
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,780
<31-2,MARIA>或者他可能知道工艺品在哪
<31-2,MARIA>Or maybe he knows where the artifact is.

562
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:20,040
<32-1,CASTLE>赶快问她那个人的名字
<32-1,CASTLE>Just ask her his name.

563
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,450
<32-2,ESPOSITO>你还记得他的名字吗
<32-2,ESPOSITO>Do you remember his name?

564
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,940
<32-3,BECKETT>卡塞尔先生
<32-3,BECKETT>Mr. Castle!

565
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:26,540
<32-4,CASTLE>你好  我正在  我只是
<32-4,CASTLE>Hey! I was... I just...

566
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,690
<32-4,CASTLE>不敢相信她竟然把我关起来了
<32-4,CASTLE>I can't believe she locked me up.

567
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:34,690
<32-4,CASTLE>她还不知道
<32-4,CASTLE>She -- she has no idea

568
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:36,960
<33-1,CASTLE>她这是在阻止我回到她身边
<33-1,CASTLE>she's stopping me from getting back to her.

569
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,020
<33-2,PERP>我不知道  伙计
<33-2,PERP>I don't know, man.

570
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,940
<33-2,PERP>可能这才是你真实的生活
<33-2,PERP>Maybe this is your real life.

571
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:41,200
<33-2,PERP>你说你有钱有名还和这个性感警察订了婚
<33-2,PERP>'Cause the one where you're rich and famous

572
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,500
<33-2,PERP>对我来说才像是编出来
<33-2,PERP>and engaged to the hot cop sounds pretty made-up to me.

573
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,610
<33-3,BECKETT>我给你妈打了电话
<33-3,BECKETT>I called your mother.

574
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:47,640
<33-3,BECKETT>她不肯来接你
<33-3,BECKETT>She refused to come and get you.

575
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,930
<33-4,CASTLE>她坚信严厉是最好的教育方式
<33-4,CASTLE>Oh. Well, she always did believe in tough love.

576
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:52,880
<33-5,BECKETT>不过看起来教育得并不成功
<33-5,BECKETT>That doesn't seem to have worked out in your case.

577
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,830
<33-6,CASTLE>确实如此
<33-6,CASTLE>No.

578
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,480
<33-7,BECKETT>卡塞尔先生  你为什么对这案子这么上心
<33-7,BECKETT>What is it with you and this case, Mr. Castle?

579
00:25:57,770 --> 00:25:59,370
<33-8,CASTLE>我是个推理作家
<33-8,CASTLE>I'm a mystery writer and I'm compelled

580
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:00,480
<33-8,CASTLE>我非得知道故事怎么收尾
<33-8,CASTLE>to know how the story ends.

581
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,280
<33-9,BECKETT>你的故事
<33-9,BECKETT>With you...

582
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:04,610
<33-9,BECKETT>以回家收尾
<33-9,BECKETT>...going home.

583
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:06,540
<33-10,CASTLE>你放我走吗
<33-10,CASTLE>You're letting me go?

584
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,040
<33-11,BECKETT>我也能让你在这呆一晚上
<33-11,BECKETT>Well, I could let you stay overnight,

585
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,900
<33-11,BECKETT>但那样的话我就得写书面报告了
<33-11,BECKETT>but then I would have to do the paperwork.

586
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:11,200
<33-12,CASTLE>不不  我
<33-12,CASTLE>No, no. I, uh...

587
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:18,210
<33-13,BECKETT>你说得对  我们之前见过
<33-13,BECKETT>You know, you were right. We have met before.

588
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:21,660
<33-15,BECKETT>-见过吗  -德里克·斯道姆小说的签售
<33-15,BECKETT>- We have? - On a book tour for an old Derrick Storm novel.

589
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:25,110
<33-15,BECKETT>我排队等  打算让你签名
<33-15,BECKETT>I, uh, waited in line to get it signed...by you.

590
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,160
<33-15,BECKETT>我以前很喜欢这些书
<33-15,BECKETT>I used to love those books.

591
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:29,480
<33-16,CASTLE>你从来没跟我说过
<33-16,CASTLE>You never told me that.

592
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:31,300
<33-17,BECKETT>我们才认识了一天
<33-17,BECKETT>Well, we've only known each other for a day.

593
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:34,140
<33-17,BECKETT>尽管感觉起来  远长于一天
<33-17,BECKETT>Although it feels a lot longer.

594
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,000
<33-18,CASTLE>跟我混  容易产生这样的错觉
<33-18,CASTLE>I have that effect on people.

595
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:40,750
<33-19,BECKETT>我一直有件事想问你
<33-19,BECKETT>There's something I've been meaning to ask you.

596
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:41,960
<33-20,CASTLE>随便问
<33-20,CASTLE>Anything.

597
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,360
<33-21,BECKETT>为什么你要让德里克·斯道姆死掉呢
<33-21,BECKETT>Why did you kill Derrick Storm?

598
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:47,120
<33-22,ESPOSITO>警监
<33-22,ESPOSITO>Hey, cap.

599
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,490
<33-22,ESPOSITO>我们有线索了
<33-22,ESPOSITO>We've got something.

600
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,920
<33-23,BECKETT>下次吧
<33-23,BECKETT>Another time, I guess.

601
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,410
<33-23,BECKETT>晚安  卡塞尔先生
<33-23,BECKETT>Good night, Mr. Castle.

602
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,900
<34-1,RYAN>我们和机场迎宾员谈了谈
<34-1,RYAN>So we talked to the concierge at the airport.

603
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,600
<34-1,RYAN>他承认从玛利亚那收了贿赂
<34-1,RYAN>He admitted to taking a bribe from Maria

604
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,320
<34-1,RYAN>换了豪轿公司  但他发誓没告诉别人
<34-1,RYAN>to switch limo companies, but he swore he didn't tell anyone.

605
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,780
<34-2,ESPOSITO>但当我们给他施压时
<34-2,ESPOSITO>But when we held his feet to the fire,

606
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:07,610
<34-2,ESPOSITO>他才把那晚看到的事情说了出来
<34-2,ESPOSITO>he came clean about what he saw that night.

607
00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:10,390
<34-3,RYAN>一辆黑色的奔驰SUV停在机场门外
<34-3,RYAN>A black g-wagon sitting outside the airport gates

608
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:12,400
<34-3,RYAN>-有两个人在里面  -就是开枪的人
<34-3,RYAN>- with two guys in it. - Our shooters.

609
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,930
<34-4,BECKETT>他们肯定是在等甘斯勒
<34-4,BECKETT>So they must have been waiting for Gensler,

610
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:16,710
<34-4,BECKETT>然后就跟踪了他
<34-4,BECKETT>and then they followed him from the airport.

611
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:17,640
<34-5,ESPOSITO>是的  在等待期间
<34-5,ESPOSITO>Yeah, and while they were waiting,

612
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,210
<34-5,ESPOSITO>其中一个人出来抽烟
<34-5,ESPOSITO>one of them stepped out for a smoke.

613
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:20,980
<34-5,ESPOSITO>监控系统拍到了他
<34-5,ESPOSITO>Surveillance caught him on camera.

614
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:22,890
<34-6,RYAN>我们发了全境通告  明天早上
<34-6,RYAN>We issued a B.O.L.O., and we're gonna run the tattoo

615
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:24,080
<34-6,RYAN>我们会在数据库里查找那个纹身
<34-6,RYAN>through the database in the morning.

616
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,220
<34-7,BECKETT>好的  有消息随时通知我
<34-7,BECKETT>All right. Why don't you gentlemen keep me apprised?

617
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:27,050
<35-1,CASTLE>好的
<35-1,CASTLE>Yeah.

618
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,240
<35-2,BECKETT>我以为我们已达成一致  你得闪人了
<35-2,BECKETT>I thought we agreed that you were leaving.

619
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,710
<35-3,CASTLE>我对这个案子有个想法
<35-3,CASTLE>Well, I had a thought about the case.

620
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,900
<35-4,BECKETT>你跟这个案子没关系
<35-4,BECKETT>You're not on the case.

621
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:49,080
<35-5,CASTLE>事实上  我是在想你
<35-5,CASTLE>Actually, I was thinking about you.

622
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:50,780
<35-5,CASTLE>我在想我能否请你喝一杯
<35-5,CASTLE>I was wondering if I could buy you a drink.

623
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:53,190
<35-5,CASTLE>这是最起码的  我欠了你的情
<35-5,CASTLE>It's the least I could do. I owe you that much.

624
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:54,790
<35-6,BECKETT>可我觉得这不是个好...
<35-6,BECKETT>Right. Well, I don't think that that would be a good --

625
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:59,270
<35-7,CASTLE>你来  就告诉你我写死德里克·斯道姆的原因
<35-7,CASTLE>And if you come, I will tell you why I killed Derrick Storm.

626
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:06,170
<36-1,CASTLE>史上最年轻的女警监
<36-1,CASTLE>So, the youngest woman to ever make captain.

627
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:07,800
<36-1,CASTLE>太了不起了
<36-1,CASTLE>That's impressive.

628
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,380
<36-2,BECKETT>-没那么好啦  -不是吗
<36-2,BECKETT>- It's not all that it's cracked up to be. - No?

629
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:13,630
<36-4,BECKETT>不  如果你真以我为原型创造角色
<36-4,BECKETT>No, and if you really are basing a character on me,

630
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:14,860
<36-5,CASTLE>她肯定很没无聊
<36-5,CASTLE>then she's gonna be boring.

631
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,640
<36-5,CASTLE>我可不觉得你会无趣
<36-5,CASTLE>Oh, I doubt you could ever be boring.

632
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:21,530
<36-6,BECKETT>我的生活里尽是些书面报告和警局政治
<36-6,BECKETT>Well, my life mostly consists of paperwork and politics.

633
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,680
<36-7,CASTLE>你想念办案时光
<36-7,CASTLE>Ah, you miss the streets.

634
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:28,000
<36-8,BECKETT>说实话  我觉得
<36-8,BECKETT>Truthfully, I-I don't think

635
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,560
<36-8,BECKETT>我不该成为一个凶案警探
<36-8,BECKETT>that I was meant to be a homicide detective.

636
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,460
<36-9,CASTLE>为什么这么说
<36-9,CASTLE>Why would you say that?

637
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:35,020
<36-10,BECKETT>因为让我想成为警察的那个案子
<36-10,BECKETT>Because the case that made me want to be a cop,

638
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,630
<36-10,BECKETT>我一直没能侦破
<36-10,BECKETT>I was never able to solve.

639
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:40,850
<36-11,BECKETT>不过  话说回来
<36-11,BECKETT>Anyway, back to you.

640
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,570
<36-11,BECKETT>你为什么写死德里克·斯道姆呢
<36-11,BECKETT>Why did you kill off Derrick Storm?

641
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:46,360
<36-12,CASTLE>这有点复杂
<36-12,CASTLE>Ah. It's complicated.

642
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,140
<36-13,BECKETT>等一下  这是什么地方
<36-13,BECKETT>Wait. What is this place?

643
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:51,580
<36-14,CASTLE>-我以为这只是个约会  -你听我说完
<36-14,CASTLE>- I thought this was a date. - Okay, hang on. Hear me out.

644
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:53,000
<36-15,BECKETT>你还在查那个案子
<36-15,BECKETT>You're still working the case.

645
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,370
<36-16,CASTLE>听着  深红犀牛是澳大利亚
<36-16,CASTLE>Listen. The crimson rhino is the mascot

646
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:56,940
<36-16,CASTLE>一个橄榄球队的吉祥物
<36-16,CASTLE>for an Australian rugby team.

647
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:59,550
<36-16,CASTLE>如果嫌犯脖子上有那个纹身
<36-16,CASTLE>If our suspect has a tattoo on his neck,

648
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,380
<36-16,CASTLE>他肯定是球队的铁杆粉丝  我查了下
<36-16,CASTLE>he's got to be a major fan. I looked it up.

649
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,970
<36-16,CASTLE>这是纽约唯一一家
<36-16,CASTLE>There's only one bar in New York

650
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:04,990
<36-16,CASTLE>会现场直播他们比赛的酒吧
<36-16,CASTLE>that plays their games live.

651
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:06,290
<36-16,CASTLE>现在就有一场比赛
<36-16,CASTLE>And there's one on right now.

652
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,760
<36-17,BECKETT>我就知道这是个错误
<36-17,BECKETT>I knew this was a mistake.

653
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:09,360
<36-18,CASTLE>贝克特  等等
<36-18,CASTLE>Beckett, wait.

<36-18,CASTLE>It's him.

655
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:16,010
<36-19,BECKETT>待在这
<36-19,BECKETT>Stay here.

656
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,130
<36-19,BECKETT>打扰一下
<36-19,BECKETT>Excuse me.

<36-20,BECKETT>把手放在我能看到的地方
<36-20,BECKETT>and put your hands where I can see them.

659
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:28,840
<36-21,TATTOOED MAN>当然
<36-21,TATTOOED MAN>Sure thing.

<36-23,CASTLE>你和我  是对好搭档唉
<36-23,CASTLE>We make a pretty good team, you and I.

661
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,440
<37-1,CASTLE>他说了什么
<37-1,CASTLE>Well? What'd he say?

662
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:51,260
<37-2,BECKETT>什么都没说  在他那厉害律师的建议下
<37-2,BECKETT>Nothing, on the advice of his high-powered counsel.

663
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:56,180
<37-3,CASTLE>-那我们接下来有什么行动  -没行动
<37-3,CASTLE>- Okay, so what's our next move? - There is no next move.

664
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:58,450
<37-4,BECKETT>你说你想待到案子破了再走
<37-4,BECKETT>You asked to stick around until this case was resolved.

665
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:00,050
<37-5,CASTLE>-现在已经破案了  -这怎么能算破案
<37-5,CASTLE>- It's resolved. - How is it resolved?

666
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:02,440
<37-6,BECKETT>莱恩和埃斯波西托警探在嫌犯家找到了
<37-6,BECKETT>Detectives Ryan and Esposito found the G-wagon

667
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,710
<37-6,BECKETT>那辆奔驰还有杀人凶器
<37-6,BECKETT>and the murder weapons at our suspect's place.

668
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,110
<37-6,BECKETT>一切都明了了
<37-6,BECKETT>This is open-and-shut.

669
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:07,680
<37-7,CASTLE>那个工艺品呢  我们得找到它
<37-7,CASTLE>What about the artifact? We need to find it.

670
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,090
<37-8,BECKETT>那个让他们偷东西的人
<37-8,BECKETT>Whoever had them steal it,

671
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:11,840
<37-8,BECKETT>那东西和他们早就不见了
<37-8,BECKETT>it and they are long gone by now.

672
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,640
<37-9,CASTLE>肯定有人知道它在哪里
<37-9,CASTLE>Someone has to know where it is.

673
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:14,850
<37-9,CASTLE>还有一个枪手
<37-9,CASTLE>There's the other shooter.

674
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:17,060
<37-10,BECKETT>但我们没有办法找到他
<37-10,BECKETT>Okay, but we have no way to find him.

675
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:20,350
<37-10,BECKETT>地方检察官会要一个认罪协议
<37-10,BECKETT>Look, the D.A.'s gonna ask for a plea deal.

676
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:23,280
<37-10,BECKETT>但相信我  这个嫌犯以前是军人
<37-10,BECKETT>But trust me, this suspect's ex-military.

677
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,100
<37-11,CASTLE>-他不可能供出同伴的  -就这么放手了
<37-11,CASTLE>- He's not gonna roll. - So that's it?

678
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,140
<37-12,BECKETT>这不是你的书  卡塞尔先生
<37-12,BECKETT>This isn't one of your books, Mr. Castle.

679
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:28,670
<37-12,BECKETT>你不会总能找到答案
<37-12,BECKETT>You don't always get the answers.

680
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:31,370
<37-12,BECKETT>我们已经结案了  我们赢了
<37-12,BECKETT>We cleared the case. It's a win.

681
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:34,040
<37-12,BECKETT>不  不能就这样了结
<37-12,BECKETT>No, you know, that -- that can't be it.

682
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:37,050
<37-13,CASTLE>我那个世界的凯特·贝克特绝不会就此罢休
<37-13,CASTLE>The Kate Beckett in my world would never call this a win.

683
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:39,400
<37-13,CASTLE>我认识的凯特·贝克特绝不会
<37-13,CASTLE>The Kate Beckett where I come from, she would be unrelenting

684
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,070
<37-13,CASTLE>碰到一点点困难就放弃
<37-13,CASTLE>in the face of anything that's thrown in her path.

685
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:42,740
<37-13,CASTLE>她会追寻真相  她绝对...
<37-13,CASTLE>She would find the truth, and she would...

686
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,830
<37-13,CASTLE>不会妥协
<37-13,CASTLE>never compromise.

687
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,350
<37-14,BECKETT>我不了解那个你自称来自的
<37-14,BECKETT>I don't know what "Twilight Zone" world

688
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:49,430
<37-14,BECKETT>《阴阳魔界》  但你并不了解我
<37-14,BECKETT>you think you come from, but you don't know me,

689
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:50,880
<37-14,BECKETT>也请别装作了
<37-14,BECKETT>and don't pretend you do.

00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,100
<37-14,BECKETT>我们没什么可说的了
<37-14,BECKETT>We're done here.

692

<38-2,ALEXIS>-你还没睡呢  -还在洛杉矶时间呢
<38-2,ALEXIS>- You're still up. - Still on LA Time.

693
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:14,990
<38-3,CASTLE>也对
<38-3,CASTLE>Right.

694
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:18,290
<38-4,ALEXIS>你找到那个神秘陨石了吗
<38-4,ALEXIS>So did you find your mystic meteor?

695
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:21,550
<38-5,CASTLE>不  没有  线索断了
<38-5,CASTLE>No, no, um... trail went cold.

696
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:24,010
<38-6,ALEXIS>看来你要和我们困在这了
<38-6,ALEXIS>Guess you're stuck here with us then.

697
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:26,850
<38-7,CASTLE>过来  和我坐会儿
<38-7,CASTLE>Come, come sit with me.

<38-8,CASTLE>来吧  给我一次机会
<38-8,CASTLE>Come on. Just give me a chance.

699
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:31,350
<38-8,CASTLE>看在以往的情份上
<38-8,CASTLE>Just, um, for old times' sake.

700
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:33,390
<38-8,CASTLE>我有个问题问你
<38-8,CASTLE>I have a-a question for you.

701
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:37,560
<38-8,CASTLE>希望能得到非反讽的回答
<38-8,CASTLE>And, and I would love a-a non-ironic answer.

702
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:40,940
<38-8,CASTLE>我们之间到底发生了什么
<38-8,CASTLE>What happened between us?

703
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,420
<38-8,CASTLE>你为什么要搬去洛杉矶
<38-8,CASTLE>Why did you move to LA?

704
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:44,400
<38-9,ALEXIS>你心里清楚
<38-9,ALEXIS>You know why.

705
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,090
<38-10,CASTLE>再讲一遍吧
<38-10,CASTLE>Uh, tell me again.

706
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:48,870
<38-11,ALEXIS>因为你放弃了
<38-11,ALEXIS>Because you gave up.

707
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:52,090
<38-11,ALEXIS>你看了那些对你著作的负面评论
<38-11,ALEXIS>You read all those terrible reviews on your magnum opus,

708
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,300
<38-11,ALEXIS>心里的那道坎始终过不去
<38-11,ALEXIS>and you couldn't move past it,

709
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,340
<38-11,ALEXIS>我没法待在这儿看你这样
<38-11,ALEXIS>And I couldn't stick around and watch.

710
00:31:58,370 --> 00:31:59,370
<38-11,ALEXIS>可你知道吗
<38-11,ALEXIS>But you know what?

711
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:02,320
<38-11,ALEXIS>我想我现在能理解了
<38-11,ALEXIS>Now I think I understand it.

712
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,240
<38-12,CASTLE>为什么这么说
<38-12,CASTLE>What do you mean?

713
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,100
<38-13,ALEXIS>我原本雄心壮志
<38-13,ALEXIS>I had all these plans, you know?

714
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,600
<38-13,ALEXIS>想要改变世界
<38-13,ALEXIS>To change the world.

715
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:09,140
<38-13,ALEXIS>我一直在为公益事业努力工作
<38-13,ALEXIS>But this nonprofit I'm working for --

716
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:12,110
<38-13,ALEXIS>可所做的一切都显得渺小虚无
<38-13,ALEXIS>Everything we do seems so small and pointless.

717
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:13,230
<38-13,ALEXIS>感觉我做什么都没有意义
<38-13,ALEXIS>It's like nothing I do matters,

718
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:14,350
<38-13,ALEXIS>那我为什么还要做呢
<38-13,ALEXIS>so why try?

719
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:15,840
<38-13,ALEXIS>亲爱的  不是的
<38-13,ALEXIS>Sweetie, no. Um...

720
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:19,590
<38-14,CASTLE>你所做的每一件事都有意义
<38-14,CASTLE>Everything you do matters.

721
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:23,100
<38-14,CASTLE>每个瞬间  每个你做的决定
<38-14,CASTLE>Every moment, every decision you make,

722
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,480
<38-14,CASTLE>都影响着你周遭的人们
<38-14,CASTLE>it affects the people around you,

723
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:28,780
<38-14,CASTLE>都在潜移默化地改变着世界
<38-14,CASTLE>it changes the world in a million imperceptible ways.

724
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:30,910
<38-14,CASTLE>不论现实世界是怎样的
<38-14,CASTLE>And no matter what your reality,

725
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:32,230
<38-14,CASTLE>你都可以努力使它变得更好
<38-14,CASTLE>you can make it better.

726
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,090
<38-14,CASTLE>我们都可以
<38-14,CASTLE>We both can.

727
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:42,460
<38-15,ALEXIS>我好想你  爸爸
<38-15,ALEXIS>I've missed you, dad.

728
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,600
<39-1,MARTHA>亲爱的  你这是要去哪里
<39-1,MARTHA>Darling, where are you off to?

729
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:00,270
<2-20,BECKETT>我决定听从自己内心的声音
<2-20,BECKETT>I'm gonna take my own advice.

730
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:03,300
<39-2,CASTLE>我知道为什么老天把我弄到这个世界来
<39-2,CASTLE>I know why the universe sent me to this world.

731
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:07,540
<39-2,CASTLE>就算一生中最重要的一天搞砸了
<39-2,CASTLE>So the most important day of our lives got screwed up.

732
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:08,600
<39-2,CASTLE>那又怎样
<39-2,CASTLE>Big deal.

733
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,810
<39-2,CASTLE>她和我一起才更幸福
<39-2,CASTLE>She's better off with me.

734
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:13,310
<39-2,CASTLE>我和她在一起才更好  即使在这个世界
<39-2,CASTLE>And I'm better off with her, even in this world.

735
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:17,070
<39-2,CASTLE>假如我能向这个贝克特证明她有多厉害
<39-2,CASTLE>If I can prove to this Beckett how extraordinary she is,

736
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:19,080
<39-2,CASTLE>那她就能帮我找到这个工艺品
<39-2,CASTLE>she can help me find that artifact,

737
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:21,370
<39-2,CASTLE>这样我就能回去了
<39-2,CASTLE>and I can get back home.

738
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:24,300
<40-1,CASHIER>好了  里克的大杯卡布奇诺
<40-1,CASHIER>There you go. It's a large cappuccino for Rick,

<40-4,JACK>That's okay. I'll give you a ride.

744
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:37,790
<40-5,CASTLE>我讨厌这个世界
<40-5,CASTLE>I hate this world.

746
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:47,170
<41-1,CASTLE>别紧张  放松点
<41-1,CASTLE>Easy. Take it easy.

747

<41-3,CASTLE>Marcus Lark. Lark Development.

749
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,490
<41-3,CASTLE>原来你就是幕后黑手
<41-3,CASTLE>So you're behind this.

750
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:57,100
<41-4,MARCUS LARK>你对这个了解多少  卡赛尔先生
<41-4,MARCUS LARK>What do you know about this, Mr. Castle?

751
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,770
<41-5,CASTLE>我知道你为了它杀了两个人
<41-5,CASTLE>I know you killed two men for it.

752
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,730
<41-6,LARK>你知道的可不止这些
<41-6,LARK>Oh, you know more than that.

753

<41-6,LARK>我的律师在警局无意听到你的话
<41-6,LARK>My attorney overheard you at the police station.

754
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:06,960
<41-6,LARK>我就让他查了下你的底细
<41-6,LARK>So I had him check up on you.

755
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:09,260
<41-6,LARK>过去两天的表现非常奇怪
<41-6,LARK>Pretty strange behavior the last two days,

756
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:11,320
<41-6,LARK>就是说要么是因为你精神不正常
<41-6,LARK>which means either you're psychotic,

757
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:12,600
<41-6,LARK>要么是因为这不是你的世界
<41-6,LARK>or this isn't your world.

758
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,050
<41-7,CASTLE>我完全不知道你在讲什么
<41-7,CASTLE>I have no idea what you're talking about.

759
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:16,550
<41-8,LARK>我觉得你知道
<41-8,LARK>I think you do.

760
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:24,600
<41-9,LARK>你知不知道我花了多少年时间寻找这个
<41-9,LARK>Do you know how many years I spent looking for this?

761
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,010
<41-9,LARK>获取不为人知的奥秘
<41-9,LARK>Hearing the whispered secrets.

765
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:38,300
<41-9,LARK>我毕生都在从传说中寻找真相
<41-9,LARK>I spent years untangling legend from truth.

766

<41-9,LARK>印加人认为这是通往众神的入口
<41-9,LARK>The Incans believed it was a gateway to the gods,

767
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:45,400
<41-9,LARK>可惜  并不是
<41-9,LARK>But...it's not.

768
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:48,700
<41-9,LARK>它是开启无限种可能的钥匙
<41-9,LARK>It's a doorway to the infinite.

769
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:51,850
<41-9,LARK>一个改变我宿命的机会

00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:56,720
<41-9,LARK>它所有的秘密我都知道  卡赛尔先生
<41-9,LARK>I know everything about this, Mr. Castle --

771
00:34:57,390 --> 00:34:58,850
<41-10,CASTLE>就是不知道它如何起效
<41-10,CASTLE>Except how it works.

772
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:02,160
<41-10,CASTLE>你有钱  事业有成  什么都有
<41-10,CASTLE>You're rich, successful. You have everything.

773
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,650
<41-10,CASTLE>为什么想要改变自己的宿命
<41-10,CASTLE>Why would you want to change your destiny?

774
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:06,720
<41-11,LARK>是个人都有后悔的事情
<41-11,LARK>No man lives without regrets.

775
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:09,090
<41-11,LARK>别废话了  卡塞尔先生
<41-11,LARK>Now then, Mr. Castle,

776
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,270
<41-11,LARK>到底是什么原理
<41-11,LARK>How does it work?

777
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,230
<41-11,LARK>我不知道
<41-11,LARK>I don't know.

778
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,500
<41-12,CASTLE>我就是拿在手上  然后就这么发生了
<41-12,CASTLE>I was holding on to it, and it just happened.

779
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:15,680
<41-13,LARK>我无意伤害你
<41-13,LARK>Look, I don't want to hurt you,

780
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,090
<41-13,LARK>但假如你不告诉  我不得不那样做
<41-13,LARK>but I will if you don't tell me how it works.

781
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:20,100
<41-14,CASTLE>我发誓  我真的不知道
<41-14,CASTLE>I swear to you, I don't know.

782
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,900
<41-15,LARK>-打穿他的膝盖  -什么
<41-15,LARK>- Shoot out his knee. - What?

<41-17,BECKETT>纽约警察  马上放下武器
<41-17,BECKETT>N.Y.P.D.! Drop your weapon now!

784
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:28,020
<41-18,CASTLE>后悔这个吧
<41-18,CASTLE>Regret this!

785

<41-20,CASTLE>-你没事吧  -没  你怎么找到我的
<41-20,CASTLE>- Are you okay? - Yeah. How'd you find me?

786
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,920
<41-21,BECKETT>我不停回想你说的关于绝不妥协的事
<41-21,BECKETT>I couldn't stop thinking about what you said about compromise.

787
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:41,210
<41-21,BECKETT>所以我回顾了整个调查
<41-21,BECKETT>So I decided to retrace the investigation.

788
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:44,200
<41-21,BECKETT>我能找到这  完全是靠运气
<41-21,BECKETT>It's -- it's just pure luck that it brought me here when it did.

789
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:45,240
<41-22,CASTLE>或是命运
<41-22,CASTLE>Or fate.

790
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,990
<41-23,BECKETT>你怎么在这里  他们想从你这获取什么
<41-23,BECKETT>Why are you here? What did they want from you?

791
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:57,880
<41-24,CASTLE>一件我并没有的东西
<41-24,CASTLE>Something I guess I didn't have.

792
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,050
<41-25,CASTLE>小心
<41-25,CASTLE>Look out!

793
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:05,000
<41-26,BECKETT>天啊
