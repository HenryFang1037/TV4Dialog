1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:03,790
<39-12,BAUER>很少有人调到这儿来  你是哪人
<39-12,BAUER>You don't get too many transfer at this place. Where you from?

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:06,940
<49-16,PAM>奥尔巴尼  能来大城市我真激动
<49-16,PAM>Albany. I'm just so excited to be in the big city.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,520
<49-17,BECKETT>别太开心了
<49-17,BECKETT>Yeah, well, don't get too excited.

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,700
<49-18,CASTLE>跟在奥尔巴尼打扫房间不会有什么两样
<49-18,CASTLE>Same rooms as the ones you cleaned in Albany.

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,620
<49-19,BECKETT>床一样  地毯一样  每天早上都乱得要死
<49-19,BECKETT>Same beds, same carpets, same mess every morning.

6
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:17,680
<49-20,EDDIE>老天啊
<49-20,EDDIE>Oh, my god.

9
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:26,860
<49-20,EDDIE>那是咖啡味儿吗
<49-20,EDDIE>Do I smell coffee?

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,770
<2-1,CASTLE>如果有  一定是家养小精灵煮的
<2-1,CASTLE>If you do, it was made by elves.

11
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,390
<2-2,CASTLE>天呐
<2-2,CASTLE>Geez!

12
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,460
<2-3,ALEXIS CASTLE>你吓着我了
<2-3,ALEXIS CASTLE>You scared me.

13
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:50,980
<2-4,BECKETT>是啊  这一大早上够刺激的
<2-4,BECKETT>Yeah, I think we all just kick-started our day.

14
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:52,580
<2-5,CASTLE>你怎么在这儿
<2-5,CASTLE>What are you doing here?

15
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:54,750
<2-6,ALEXIS>我昨晚做家教做到很晚
<2-6,ALEXIS>Oh, my tutoring job went late,

16
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,020
<2-6,ALEXIS>又没有城铁回我那儿
<2-6,ALEXIS>and the train wasn't running back to my place,

17
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,850
<2-6,ALEXIS>就在这儿过夜了  希望你不介意
<2-6,ALEXIS>so I crashed here. Hope you don't mind.

18
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,720
<2-7,CASTLE>当然不介意了  话说
<2-7,CASTLE>No! No, of course not. Matter of fact,

21
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,590
<2-7,CASTLE>既然你跟男朋友分手了
<2-7,CASTLE>um, now that you've broken up with your boyfriend,

22
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:06,580
<2-7,CASTLE>其实你完全可以搬回来啊
<2-7,CASTLE>there's really no reason you can't move back in here.

24
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:08,040
<2-8,ALEXIS>其实我真的不可以
<2-8,ALEXIS>Actually, there are many reasons,

26
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:09,430
<2-8,ALEXIS>首先  我有份租约
<2-8,ALEXIS>starting with "I have a lease."

27
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,750
<2-9,CASTLE>我说过这我能想办法
<2-9,CASTLE>Ah. I told you I would help you with that.

28
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:13,710
<2-9,CASTLE>而且你知道我不希望你一个人住那儿
<2-9,CASTLE>And you know I-I don't like you living in that place alone.

30
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,610
<2-10,ALEXIS>老爸  没事的  我应付得来
<2-10,ALEXIS>Dad, it's fine. I can handle it.

31
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,450
<2-10,ALEXIS>我得走了  早上还有课
<2-10,ALEXIS>I got to go. I have an early class.

32
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,560
<2-11,BECKETT>早上就有案子
<2-11,BECKETT>And we have an early murder.

33
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,370
<3-1,CASTLE>她跟派一起住的时候是一码事
<3-1,CASTLE>Well, it was one thing when she was living there with Pi,

34
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:28,660
<3-1,CASTLE>但现在她一个人了
<3-1,CASTLE>But now that she's alone,

35
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,200
<3-1,CASTLE>为什么不离开那鬼地方  回家住呢
<3-1,CASTLE>why not dump the dump and come home?

36
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,600
<3-2,BECKETT>或许她在享受独立的感觉啊
<3-2,BECKETT>Well, maybe she's enjoying her independence.

37
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,980
<3-3,CASTLE>她没时间独立
<3-3,CASTLE>She doesn't have time for independence.

38
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:37,270
<3-3,CASTLE>她得去做家教  上课  实践工作
<3-3,CASTLE>She's got her tutoring gigs, her classes, her work-study job.

39
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:38,240
<3-3,CASTLE>她都累坏了
<3-3,CASTLE>She's exhausted.

40
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,550
<3-4,BECKETT>卡塞尔  她这人挺固执的
<3-4,BECKETT>Well, Castle, I mean, she's strong-willed.

41
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:42,060
<3-4,BECKETT>或许是放不下面子
<3-4,BECKETT>Maybe it's pride.

42
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,030
<3-5,CASTLE>如果真是那个原因  应该会更自豪一些
<3-5,CASTLE>If it were pride, she'd be more... well, proud.

43
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:46,620
<3-5,CASTLE>有别的原因
<3-5,CASTLE>No, there's something else...

44
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:49,020
<3-5,CASTLE>她有其他不肯回家的理由
<3-5,CASTLE>Another reason why she's not coming home.

45
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:52,880
<3-6,CASTLE>-西托  -诶
<3-6,CASTLE>- Sito! - Yeah.

46
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:54,760
<3-8,CASTLE>有人没能退房吗
<3-8,CASTLE>Someone miss a check-out?

47
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:55,780
<3-9,ESPOSITO>他倒是死翘翘了
<3-9,ESPOSITO>No, he checked out, all right.

48
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,500
<3-9,ESPOSITO>客房服务员发现贾斯汀·马奎特
<3-9,ESPOSITO>Housekeeping found this guy, Justin Marquette,

49
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,060
<3-9,ESPOSITO>死在147房间里
<3-9,ESPOSITO>dead in room 147.

50
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,710
<3-9,ESPOSITO>驾照上写着他就住在附近
<3-9,ESPOSITO>His driver's license says he lives nearby.

51
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:06,220
<4-1,BECKETT>胸口中一枪吗
<4-1,BECKETT>Single gunshot to the chest?

52
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,790
<4-2,LANIE PARISH>一枪致命
<4-2,LANIE PARISH>One is all it took.

53
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:11,650
<4-2,LANIE PARISH>从入口伤来看  应该是小口径手枪
<4-2,LANIE PARISH>Based on the entry wound, I'd say a small-caliber handgun.

54
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,050
<4-2,LANIE PARISH>尸僵和肝温度
<4-2,LANIE PARISH>Lividity and liver temp

55
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,620
<4-2,LANIE PARISH>表明死亡时间是昨晚10点到午夜
<4-2,LANIE PARISH>put the time of death between 10:00 p.m. and midnight.

56
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,580
<4-3,BECKETT>直到早上才被人发现吗
<4-3,BECKETT>And he wasn't found until morning?

57
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,620
<4-4,BECKETT>那怎么没人听到枪声呢
<4-4,BECKETT>So how come no one heard the shot?

58
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:21,300
<4-5,ESPOSITO>周围的房间都是空的
<4-5,ESPOSITO>All the neighboring rooms are empty.

59
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,100
<4-5,ESPOSITO>经理说只有40%的客房有住客
<4-5,ESPOSITO>The manager says that the place is only about 40% occupied.

60
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,260
<4-6,CASTLE>经理说他入住的时候有人跟他一起吗
<4-6,CASTLE>Did the manager mention him checking in with anyone?

61
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,800
<4-7,ESPOSITO>房间登记在他一人名下
<4-7,ESPOSITO>The room was in his name alone.

62
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,240
<4-7,ESPOSITO>莱恩在找昨晚的前台接待
<4-7,ESPOSITO>Ryan's trying to track down the desk clerk from last night

63
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,760
<4-7,ESPOSITO>看能不能得到更详细的信息
<4-7,ESPOSITO>to see if he can get some more details.

64
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:33,170
<4-7,ESPOSITO>不过没有强行闯入的迹象
<4-7,ESPOSITO>There's no sign of forced entry, though.

65
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:34,800
<4-8,CASTLE>那么凶手不是跟他一起来的
<4-8,CASTLE>So either the killer was with him,

66
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,660
<4-8,CASTLE>-就是被死者放进来的  -对
<4-8,CASTLE>- or the victim let him in. - Yeah.

67
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:41,920
<4-10,BECKETT>看来他从小冰箱拿了一瓶水
<4-10,BECKETT>It looks like he took a bottle of water from this mini-fridge,

68
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,520
<4-10,BECKETT>转过身来就被枪击
<4-10,BECKETT>turned back around, got shot,

69
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,560
<4-10,BECKETT>然后把椅子也拽倒了
<4-10,BECKETT>and then he took the chair down with him.

70
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:49,090
<4-11,CASTLE>没有行李
<4-11,CASTLE>There's no luggage.

71
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,190
<4-11,CASTLE>你说他就住在附近  那他来这儿干什么
<4-11,CASTLE>You said he lives nearby. What was he doing here?

72
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,490
<4-12,ESPOSITO>不知道  我看了他的手机
<4-12,ESPOSITO>I don't know. I checked his phone.

73
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:54,150
<4-12,ESPOSITO>没有迹象表明他要跟谁碰面
<4-12,ESPOSITO>There was no indication of a meeting.

74
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,850
<4-12,ESPOSITO>在他死前几小时
<4-12,ESPOSITO>There was no appointments, calls, or texts

75
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:56,970
<4-12,ESPOSITO>没有约会  电话  或短信
<4-12,ESPOSITO>in the hours leading up to his death.

76
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:00,130
<4-13,KEVIN RYAN>我找到了给贾斯汀·马奎特登记入住的前台
<4-13,KEVIN RYAN>Hey. Found the desk clerk who checked in Justin Marquette.

77
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,350
<4-13,KEVIN RYAN>这家伙有问题
<4-13,KEVIN RYAN>Something's up with this guy.

78
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:03,880
<5-1,JANE>马奎特先生大概八点来的
<5-1,JANE>Uh, Mr. Marquette came at about 8:00.

79
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:06,110
<5-1,JANE>没有预定  这不算不寻常
<5-1,JANE>No reservation, which is not unusual.

80
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,580
<5-2,RYAN>简  跟他们说说房间的事
<5-2,RYAN>Jane, tell them about the room.

81
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,720
<5-3,JANE>这的确不寻常
<5-3,JANE>Well, that was unusual.

82
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,920
<5-3,JANE>他要求住在147号房间
<5-3,JANE>He asked to stay in room 147.

83
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,680
<5-3,JANE>而且还坚持要住那儿
<5-3,JANE>In fact, he insisted on it.

84
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,420
<5-4,CASTLE>147号房间有什么特别的吗
<5-4,CASTLE>Is there anything special about 147?

85
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,330
<5-5,JANE>没有  所有房间都是一样的
<5-5,JANE>No, all our rooms are identical.

86
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:16,740
<5-5,JANE>所以我才觉得奇怪
<5-5,JANE>That's why it was so strange.

87
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:17,980
<5-6,BECKETT>他以前来过吗
<5-6,BECKETT>Had he been here before?

88
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,200
<5-7,JANE>系统里查不到他
<5-7,JANE>Well, he's not in the system,

89
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,480
<5-7,JANE>所以他从没在任何一家最佳旅伴酒店入住过
<5-7,JANE>which means he's never been a guest at any Best Traveler Hotel.

90
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,240
<5-8,CASTLE>他提到他为什么要入住了吗
<5-8,CASTLE>Did he mention why he was staying?

91
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,650
<5-8,CASTLE>他不用说啊
<5-8,CASTLE>He didn't have to.

92
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:28,660
<5-9,JANE>长得挺帅  不带行李  只住一晚
<5-9,JANE>Good-looking guy, no bags, checking in for one night?

93
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:32,270
<5-9,JANE>依我的经验  他一定是来约炮的
<5-9,JANE>In my experience, that means he was here to hook up.

94
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:33,520
<5-10,BECKETT>他跟谁一起来的吗
<5-10,BECKETT>Did he come here with anyone?

95
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,990
<5-11,JANE>没有  但他在跟谁发短信
<5-11,JANE>No, but he was texting with someone.

96
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,920
<5-11,JANE>我猜那一定是他约好的人
<5-11,JANE>I figured that's who he was meeting.

97
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,610
<5-12,BECKETT>他发了短信  你确定
<5-12,BECKETT>He texted? Are you sure?

98
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:42,450
<5-12,BECKETT>我们在他手机上没发现短信
<5-12,BECKETT>We didn't find any texts on his phone.

99
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,950
<5-13,JANE>我确定
<5-13,JANE>I'm positive.

100
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:46,830
<5-14,JANE>看
<5-14,JANE>There.

101
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:48,300
<5-14,JANE>看到没  他在发短信
<5-14,JANE>See? He's texting.

102
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:50,450
<5-15,CASTLE>而且是用翻盖手机
<5-15,CASTLE>On a flip phone.

103
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,650
<5-16,BECKETT>那不是我们找到的手机
<5-16,BECKETT>That's not the phone we found.

104
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:54,850
<6-1,ESPOSITO>就我能查到的看
<6-1,ESPOSITO>As far as I can tell,

105
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:57,080
<6-1,ESPOSITO>这是贾斯汀·马奎特名下唯一的手机
<6-1,ESPOSITO>that's the only cellphone registered to Justin Marquette.

106
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,750
<6-2,BECKETT>那么我们在监控里看到的一定是另一部秘密手机
<6-2,BECKETT>So the one we saw in the video must be a second, secret one.

107
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,430
<6-3,CASTLE>而凶手为了掩藏身份给拿走了
<6-3,CASTLE>Which the killer took to hide their identity.

108
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:03,830
<6-4,BECKETT>那么这人是谁
<6-4,BECKETT>So who is this guy,

109
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:07,140
<6-4,BECKETT>为什么要用第二部手机  为什么非待在那间房
<6-4,BECKETT>why a second phone, and why room 147?

110
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:08,890
<6-5,RYAN>酒店监控没有多少信息
<6-5,RYAN>I didn't get much from hotel security video.

111
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,730
<6-5,RYAN>覆盖面不全  而且贾斯汀房间外面的
<6-5,RYAN>Coverage is sketchy, and there are no cameras

112
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:12,680
<6-5,RYAN>走廊上没有摄像头
<6-5,RYAN>in the hallway outside Justin's room.

113
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,920
<6-6,BECKETT>跟他的亲属联系上了吗
<6-6,BECKETT>Did you get ahold of next of kin?

114
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,520
<6-7,RYAN>还没  但我在他的个人网站上
<6-7,RYAN>Not yet, but I did find out about our victim

115
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,070
<6-7,RYAN>查到了一些东西
<6-7,RYAN>through his personal website.

116
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,540
<6-8,BECKETT>他还有个人网站
<6-8,BECKETT>He's got his own website?

117
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,550
<6-8,BECKETT>对  他是一名演员
<6-8,BECKETT>Yeah, he was an actor --

118
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:22,460
<6-9,RYAN>从信用等级来看  混得不怎么样
<6-9,RYAN>a struggling one, judging by his credits.

119
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,430
<6-9,RYAN>贾斯汀·马奎特
<6-9,RYAN>"Justin Marquette

120
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,170
<6-10,CASTLE>是鲁斯特戏剧公司的成员
<6-10,CASTLE>is a member of the Rooster Theater Company

00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,440
<8-1,LAURA>我们是通过戏剧公司认识的

134
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,100
<8-1,LAURA>三个月前开始交往
<8-1,LAURA>and started dating three months ago.

135
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,980
<8-1,LAURA>他今天没来排练
<8-1,LAURA>I knew something was wrong

136
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,620
<8-1,LAURA>我就觉得会不会是出事了
<8-1,LAURA>when he didn't show up for rehearsal today.

137
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,250
<8-2,BECKETT>你最后一次见到他是什么时候
<8-2,BECKETT>And when was the last time you saw him?

138
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:05,750
<8-3,LAURA>昨天早上  在我那里
<8-3,LAURA>Yesterday morning at my place.

139
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,120
<8-3,LAURA>我们出去晨跑了
<8-3,LAURA>We, um... we went for a run,

140
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,760
<8-3,LAURA>然后他冲了澡之后就去上班了
<8-3,LAURA>and then he showered and left for work.

141
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:11,680
<8-4,CASTLE>他在哪上班
<8-4,CASTLE>Where did he work?

142
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:12,850
<8-5,LAURA>大多数时候是做临时工
<8-5,LAURA>Temp jobs, mostly.

143
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,530
<8-5,LAURA>他最近挣的不多
<8-5,LAURA>He wasn't getting much recently,

144
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,320
<8-5,LAURA>但他说他不在乎  因为...
<8-5,LAURA>but he said that he didn't mind, because...

145
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:20,040
<8-5,LAURA>这样他就有更多时间和我在一起了
<8-5,LAURA>because it gave him more time to spend with me.

146
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,850
<8-6,CASTLE>知道他昨晚去最佳旅伴酒店
<8-6,CASTLE>Any idea what he would be doing at the

00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:27,180
<8-6,CASTLE>干什么吗

<8-7,LAURA>他在酒店吗

150
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:31,890
<8-8,BECKETT>劳拉  我知道这很难
<8-8,BECKETT>Look, Laura, I know this is difficult,

151
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:35,510
<8-8,BECKETT>但贾斯汀是不是有可能在劈腿
<8-8,BECKETT>but is it possible that Justin was seeing someone else?

152
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:36,820
<8-9,LAURA>什么  不会的
<8-9,LAURA>What? No.

153
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,990
<8-10,CASTLE>他有没有牵扯上什么危险或违法的事
<8-10,CASTLE>Was he involved in anything dangerous or illegal?

154
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,570
<8-11,LAURA>不不  据我所知  没有
<8-11,LAURA>No, not -- not that I know of. No.

155
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:43,690
<8-12,BECKETT>他认识的人之中
<8-12,BECKETT>Was there anyone in his life

156
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:45,120
<8-12,BECKETT>有谁想要伤害他吗
<8-12,BECKETT>that might have wanted to harm him?

157
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,310
<8-13,EDDIE>前几天的那件事  记得吗
<8-13,EDDIE>There was that thing the other day, remember?

158
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,120
<8-14,CASTLE>什么事
<8-14,CASTLE>What thing?

159
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,510
<8-15,EDDIE>一个疯女人在街上走过来
<8-15,EDDIE>Some crazy woman walked up to him on the street

160
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,510
<8-15,EDDIE>威胁他
<8-15,EDDIE>and threatened him.

161
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,900
<8-16,PAM>对  贾斯汀都吓坏了
<8-16,PAM>That's right. Justin was totally rattled.

162
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,560
<8-16,PAM>晚上差点不能上台表演
<8-16,PAM>He could barely perform that night.

163
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,380
<8-17,BECKETT>-他知道她是谁吗  -不知道
<8-17,BECKETT>- Did he know who she was? - Mnh-mnh.

164
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,350
<8-18,LAURA>他也不想谈起那件事
<8-18,LAURA>And he did not want to talk about it, either.

165
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,920
<8-18,LAURA>他只说事情发生在第九大道和梅瑟街的
<8-18,LAURA>All he said was that it happened outside a coffee shop

166
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,190
<8-18,LAURA>咖啡店外
<8-18,LAURA>on 9th and Mercer.

167
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:08,990
<8-18,LAURA>谢谢
<8-18,LAURA>Thanks.

168
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:10,620
<9-1,ESPOSITO>咖啡店打来的
<9-1,ESPOSITO>That was the coffee shop.

169
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,010
<9-1,ESPOSITO>一位咖啡师目击了全过程
<9-1,ESPOSITO>A barista saw the whole thing go down.

170
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:13,450
<9-1,ESPOSITO>店外的一个女人走向贾斯汀
<9-1,ESPOSITO>A woman walked up to Justin outside

171
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:14,570
<9-1,ESPOSITO>开始朝他吼
<9-1,ESPOSITO>and started yelling at him.

172
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:16,510
<9-2,BECKETT>-知道长相了吗  -还不止呢
<9-2,BECKETT>- You get a description? - I did better than that.

173
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:17,770
<9-3,ESPOSITO>那女人是常客了
<9-3,ESPOSITO>The woman's a regular customer.

174
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:19,510
<9-3,ESPOSITO>她有一张会员卡  名字叫安妮塔·米勒
<9-3,ESPOSITO>She's got a loyalty card, and her name's Anita Miller.

175
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:21,450
<9-3,ESPOSITO>-我派人去带她来  -好的
<9-3,ESPOSITO>- I'll send a unit to pick her up. - Great.

176
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,960
<9-3,ESPOSITO>感谢前来  米勒女士
<9-3,ESPOSITO>Thanks for coming in, Ms. Miller.

177
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,630
<9-3,ESPOSITO>我是贝克特探长
<9-3,ESPOSITO>I'm detective Beckett.

178
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:32,520
<10-1,BECKETT>我想问你几个问题  关于...
<10-1,BECKETT>Uh, I just need to ask you a few questions about --

179
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,550
<10-2,ANITA MILLER>贾斯汀·马奎特
<10-2,ANITA MILLER>Justin Marquette.

180
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:35,340
<10-3,BECKETT>看来你认识他
<10-3,BECKETT>So you know him.

181
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:37,060
<10-4,ANITA>不止是认识了  探长
<10-4,ANITA>I more than know him, detective.

182
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,890
<10-4,ANITA>事实上  我杀了他
<10-4,ANITA>In fact... I killed him.

183
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,280
<10-5,BECKETT>你是在认罪吗
<10-5,BECKETT>Are you confessing?

184
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,470
<10-6,ANITA>给我点纸  我把一切都写下来
<10-6,ANITA>Just give me some paper. I want to write it all down.

185
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,100
<10-6,ANITA>好的
<10-6,ANITA>Yeah.

186
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,530
<11-1,CASTLE>11秒认罪
<11-1,CASTLE>11 seconds to a confession.

187
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:00,030
<11-1,CASTLE>一定是你的最佳战绩了
<11-1,CASTLE>That's got to be your personal best.

188
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,100
<11-2,BECKETT>听起来你很失望啊  卡塞尔
<11-2,BECKETT>You sound like you're disappointed, Castle.

189
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,730
<11-3,CASTLE>是的  有点失望
<11-3,CASTLE>Well, I am, a little.

190
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:07,800
<11-3,CASTLE>秘密电话  147号房
<11-3,CASTLE>I mean, a secret phone, room 147 --

191
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:10,010
<11-3,CASTLE>这个案子很有阴谋的潜质
<11-3,CASTLE>this case had conspiratorial promise.

192
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:10,970
<11-5,CASTLE>更有可能的是贾斯汀
<11-5,CASTLE>Well, most likely Justin

193
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:12,460
<11-4,BECKETT>背着女友跟安妮塔好了
<11-4,BECKETT>was cheating on his girlfriend with Anita,

194
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,680
<11-4,BECKETT>后来两人在酒店见面
<11-4,BECKETT>and the two of them met up at the hotel,

195
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,890
<11-4,BECKETT>于是场面就失控了
<11-4,BECKETT>and that's where things went south.

196
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:17,700
<11-5,CASTLE>很可能就是这样  真无聊
<11-5,CASTLE>Yes, well, most likely, that is boring.

197
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:21,540
<11-6,BECKETT>并不是每个案子都会被神秘和阴谋笼罩的
<11-6,BECKETT>Look, not every case has to be shrouded in mystery and intrigue.

198
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,620
<11-7,ESPOSITO>有麻烦了
<11-7,ESPOSITO>Yo. Uh, we got a problem.

199
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,360
<11-8,BECKETT>怎么了
<11-8,BECKETT>What's wrong?

200
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,300
<11-9,ESPOSITO>我查了安妮塔·米勒的行踪
<11-9,ESPOSITO>Well, I was looking into Anita Miller's whereabouts

201
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,900
<11-9,ESPOSITO>想把她和酒店联系起来
<11-9,ESPOSITO>to try to tie her to the hotel,

202
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:30,900
<11-9,ESPOSITO>但她的信用卡记录显示
<11-9,ESPOSITO>except her credit-card records

203
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,150
<11-9,ESPOSITO>她昨晚在法吉奥饭店
<11-9,ESPOSITO>show that she was at Le Fagio restaurant last night.

204
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,490
<11-10,BECKETT>可能是别人刷了她的信用卡
<11-10,BECKETT>So maybe someone else used her credit card.

205
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:36,410
<11-11,ESPOSITO>不  经理确认是她本人
<11-11,ESPOSITO>Nah. The manager I.D.'d her.

206
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:38,270
<11-11,ESPOSITO>他说她和另一个人平摊了饭钱
<11-11,ESPOSITO>And he said that she split the bill with another guy,

207
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,620
<11-11,ESPOSITO>是她的戒酒担保人
<11-11,ESPOSITO>Her A.A. Sponsor.

208
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:40,950
<11-11,ESPOSITO>我刚问过他  他证实
<11-11,ESPOSITO>I just spoke to him, and he confirmed

209
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:43,730
<11-11,ESPOSITO>他们从晚上9点半到零点半都在一起
<11-11,ESPOSITO>that they were together from 9:30 P.M. To 12:30 A.M.

210
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,910
<11-12,CASTLE>正好在案发时间范围内
<11-12,CASTLE>But that's our entire time-of-death window.

211
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,380
<11-12,CASTLE>如果属实  那么安妮塔不可能是凶手
<11-12,CASTLE>If that's true, then Anita can't be our killer.

212
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:56,370
<11-13,BECKETT>那她为什么要认罪
<11-13,BECKETT>Then why is she confessing?

213
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:58,630
<11-14,CASTLE>看来也不那么无聊
<11-14,CASTLE>Not so boring after all.

223
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,680
<12-1,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>安妮塔·米勒承认自己是凶手
<12-1,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>So, Anita Miller is confessing to the murder,

224
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,900
<12-1,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>但她有不在场证明
<12-1,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>and she has an alibi.

225
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:11,840
<12-2,BECKETT>我们还在继续调查  长官
<12-2,BECKETT>Yeah, we're still trying to make sense of it, sir.

226
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,250
<12-3,GATES>会不会是死亡时间判断错误了
<12-3,GATES>Is it possible that we misjudged the time of death?

227
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:17,030
<12-4,BECKETT>不  蕾妮确信自己的检测
<12-4,BECKETT>No. No, Lanie stands behind her examination.

228
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,840
<12-5,GATES>好的  那么不在场证明呢
<12-5,GATES>Okay, then, what about the alibi?

229
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,100
<12-6,BECKETT>埃斯波西托已经和餐厅的人证实过了
<12-6,BECKETT>Esposito verified it with the restaurant.

230
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,390
<12-6,BECKETT>餐厅经理  迎宾员  甚至服务生
<12-6,BECKETT>The manager, the hostess, even the waiter

231
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,810
<12-6,BECKETT>都确认安妮塔整个晚上都在那儿
<12-6,BECKETT>confirmed that Anita was there all evening.

232
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:28,600
<12-6,BECKETT>不仅如此  而且这家餐厅离酒店很远
<12-6,BECKETT>Not only that, but this restaurant is nowhere near the hotel.

233
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,440
<12-7,GATES>那她就不可能是凶手
<12-7,GATES>Then she couldn't have killed the victim,

234
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,320
<12-7,GATES>那就查清楚她为什么撒谎
<12-7,GATES>so find out why she's lying.

235
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:39,800
<13-1,ANITA>写好了  我记得的所有事都写在上面了
<13-1,ANITA>It's all there, everything I remember about what I did.

236
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:43,400
<13-2,BECKETT>我们只是想当面再确认一遍
<13-2,BECKETT>Well, we just wanted to go over this in person,

237
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,540
<13-2,BECKETT>避免供词前后有出入
<13-2,BECKETT>just to clear up any discrepancies.

238
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:47,270
<13-3,ANITA>什么前后出入
<13-3,ANITA>What discrepancies?

239
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,820
<13-4,CASTLE>你就告诉我们发生了什么事
<13-4,CASTLE>Well, why don't you just tell us what happened?

240
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,530
<13-5,ANITA>我去他的房间见他
<13-5,ANITA>Well, I went to see him in his room.

241
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:54,920
<13-6,CASTLE>-哪间房间  -147号房
<13-6,CASTLE>- Which room was that? - Room 147.

242
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,200
<13-7,ANITA>147号房
<13-7,ANITA>Room 147?

243
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,830
<13-7,ANITA>就在最佳伴旅酒店
<13-7,ANITA>At the Best Traveler Hotel.

244
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:03,030
<14-1,ANITA>我敲了门
<14-1,ANITA>I knocked on the door.

245
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:05,690
<14-1,ANITA>他立马就开门了
<14-1,ANITA>He opened it almost immediately.

246
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,620
<14-2,JUSTIN>恭候你多时了  进来吧
<14-2,JUSTIN>Been waiting for you. Come on in.

247
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,660
<14-2,JUSTIN>给你拿点水喝
<14-2,JUSTIN>Let me get you a water.

248
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:11,160
<14-2,JUSTIN>他说要给我一瓶水
<14-2,JUSTIN>He offered me a bottle of water,

249
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,020
<14-2,JUSTIN>然后走到迷你冰箱去拿
<14-2,JUSTIN>and then he went to the mini-fridge.

250
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,420
<14-2,JUSTIN>就在这时我掏出了枪
<14-2,JUSTIN>That's when I took out the gun.

251
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,260
<14-2,JUSTIN>他转过身要把水递给我  然后我
<14-2,JUSTIN>He turned around to give me the water, and I...

252
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:21,990
<14-2,JUSTIN>我向他开枪了
<14-2,JUSTIN>I shot him.

253
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,410
<14-2,JUSTIN>我往他胸口开了一枪
<14-2,JUSTIN>I shot him in the chest.

254
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,340
<17-1,ANITA>之后发生了什么
<17-1,ANITA>And then what happened?

255
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,620
<17-2,BECKETT>他看上去很惊讶
<17-2,BECKETT>He looked surprised.

256
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,720
<17-3,ANITA>摇摇晃晃向后退
<17-3,ANITA>He staggered back.

257
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,240
<17-3,ANITA>手上的水掉在地上
<17-3,ANITA>He dropped the bottle of water,

258
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:34,040
<17-3,ANITA>他用手抓住了背后的椅子
<17-3,ANITA>and he kind of gripped onto the back of this chair.

259
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:37,020
<17-3,ANITA>然后他倒了下去  椅子也被带倒了
<17-3,ANITA>Then he fell and knocked it over.

260
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,940
<18-1,ESPOSITO>她描述的和犯罪现场一模一样
<18-1,ESPOSITO>That's exactly how we found the crime scene.

261
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:42,680
<18-2,RYAN>她肯定去过那儿
<18-2,RYAN>She must've been there.

262
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:44,760
<18-3,ESPOSITO>怎么会  她怎么可能去过
<18-3,ESPOSITO>How? How is that possible?

263
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:49,240
<18-4,BECKETT>安妮塔  你和贾斯汀·马奎特什么关系
<18-4,BECKETT>Anita, what was your relationship with Justin Marquette?

264
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:50,950
<19-1,ANITA>我和他的关系
<19-1,ANITA>My relationship?

265
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:52,800
<19-2,CASTLE>你们两个很熟吗
<19-2,CASTLE>Were the two of you involved?

266
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:54,570
<19-3,ANITA>我想没有
<19-3,ANITA>Uh, I don't think so.

267
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:57,150
<19-4,BECKETT>那你怎么认识他的
<19-4,BECKETT>Then how did you know him?

268
00:09:58,750 --> 00:09:59,790
<19-5,ANITA>我也不确定
<19-5,ANITA>I'm not sure.

269
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,920
<19-6,BECKETT>如果你不知道自己是怎么认识他的
<19-6,BECKETT>If you don't know how you knew him,

270
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:05,900
<19-6,BECKETT>那你为什么杀他呢
<19-6,BECKETT>then why would you kill him?

271
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,270
<19-7,ANITA>我有酒瘾
<19-7,ANITA>I'm an alcoholic.

272
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:09,310
<19-7,ANITA>他为我的酗酒负责
<19-7,ANITA>He was responsible for my drinking.

273
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,180
<19-8,CASTLE>这怎么说
<19-8,CASTLE>How was he responsible?

274
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,400
<19-9,ANITA>我不知道  我很抱歉
<19-9,ANITA>I don't know. I'm -- I'm sorry.

275
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,240
<19-9,ANITA>我最近一直都很混乱
<19-9,ANITA>I've been really confused lately.

276
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:17,870
<19-10,CASTLE>因为酗酒的事
<19-10,CASTLE>Because of the drinking.

277
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:20,190
<19-11,ANITA>不  我已经戒酒戒了四年
<19-11,ANITA>No, I've been sober for four years.

278
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:21,870
<19-11,ANITA>我依旧在和酒瘾作斗争
<19-11,ANITA>I mean, god knows I still struggle,

279
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,570
<19-11,ANITA>但是过去的这两个礼拜
<19-11,ANITA>but these last two weeks,

280
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:26,370
<19-11,ANITA>我的记忆非常的模糊
<19-11,ANITA>they've just been really... blurry.

281
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,730
<19-12,BECKETT>你记得你昨晚和你的担保人去吃晚饭吗
<19-12,BECKETT>Do you remember going to dinner with your sponsor last night?

282
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,130
<19-13,ANITA>-是昨天晚上吗  -是的
<19-13,ANITA>- Was that last night? - Mm-hmm.

283
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:35,410
<19-14,ANITA>是的  没错  是昨天晚上
<19-14,ANITA>Yes, you're right. It was.

284
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:38,650
<19-15,CASTLE>那么  你什么时候去酒店见贾斯汀呢
<19-15,CASTLE>So, then, when did you go to the hotel and meet Justin?

285
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,370
<19-16,ANITA>我不记得了
<19-16,ANITA>I don't remember.

286
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:45,430
<19-17,BECKETT>安妮塔  大概几天前  有目击证人
<19-17,BECKETT>Anita, we have a witness that saw you accost Justin

287
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:47,400
<19-17,BECKETT>在咖啡店外看见你和贾斯汀起冲突
<19-17,BECKETT>outside of a coffee shop a couple of days ago.

288
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,290
<19-17,BECKETT>-你记得吗  -是的  我记得
<19-17,BECKETT>- Do you remember that? - Yes, I do.

289
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:51,510
<19-18,ANITA>他当时在和一个大块头的秃顶男人说话
<19-18,ANITA>Uh, he was talking to this big, bald man.

290
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:54,790
<19-18,ANITA>我得警告贾斯汀  告诉他他有危险
<19-18,ANITA>I had to warn Justin, to tell him he was in danger.

291
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:57,140
<19-19,CASTLE>-那个秃顶男人要害他  -不  是我
<19-19,CASTLE>- From the bald man. - No, from me.

292
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,990
<19-20,ANITA>我见到贾斯汀时
<19-20,ANITA>The moment I saw Justin,

293
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:01,600
<19-20,ANITA>我就有一种我会伤害他的不祥预感
<19-20,ANITA>I just had this awful feeling that I was gonna hurt him.

294
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,340
<19-20,ANITA>而且我真的这么做了
<19-20,ANITA>And I did.

295
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:10,520
<20-1,RYAN>好的  谢谢
<20-1,RYAN>All right. Thanks.

296
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:13,660
<20-1,RYAN>昨晚酒店没人看到安妮塔
<20-1,RYAN>So -- no one at the hotel saw Anita last night,

297
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:16,500
<20-1,RYAN>而且技术部在监控录像上也完全找不到她
<20-1,RYAN>and tech can't find her in any of the security-cam footage.

298
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:17,750
<20-2,BECKETT>这一点也说通
<20-2,BECKETT>This doesn't make any sense.

299
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,830
<20-2,BECKETT>她知道案发的细节
<20-2,BECKETT>She knows details about our crime

300
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:21,410
<20-2,BECKETT>这些细节只有凶手才知道
<20-2,BECKETT>that only our killer could know.

301
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:23,990
<20-3,CASTLE>法医那边怎么样  鉴证组那边有没有发现什么
<20-3,CASTLE>What about forensics? Did CSU come up with anything?

302
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:25,810
<20-4,ESPOSITO>在纽约的酒店房间能有什么发现
<20-4,ESPOSITO>In a hotel room in New York city?

303
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,460
<20-4,ESPOSITO>发现的都是情趣之物
<20-4,ESPOSITO>They found all kinds of fun stuff,

304
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,490
<20-4,ESPOSITO>但没发现任何安妮塔和147号房的联系
<20-4,ESPOSITO>but nothing that tied Anita back to room 147.

305
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,820
<20-5,RYAN>也许这是一出戏
<20-5,RYAN>You know, maybe it's an act,

306
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,470
<20-5,RYAN>障眼法之类的
<20-5,RYAN>you know, some kind of smokescreen,

307
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:33,830
<20-5,RYAN>她想要替别人背黑锅
<20-5,RYAN>and she's taking the fall for someone else.

308
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:35,770
<20-6,BECKETT>可她一定知道我们会查证她的不在场证明
<20-6,BECKETT>Except she had to have known that we would check her alibi,

309
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:37,930
<20-6,BECKETT>而这与她的招供完全相悖
<20-6,BECKETT>Which completely contradicts her confession.

310
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:41,800
<20-14,BECKETT>好了  说吧
<20-14,BECKETT>All right. Come on.

311
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:43,060
<20-15,RYAN>啥
<20-15,RYAN>Hmm?

312
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,230
<20-7,ESPOSITO>跟我们说说你的"高见"  老兄
<20-7,ESPOSITO>Give us one of your theories, bro.

313
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,610
<20-8,ESPOSITO>说吧  不管你说什么  都不可能
<20-8,ESPOSITO>Come on. And whatever it is, it can't be any crazier

314
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:48,900
<20-8,ESPOSITO>比现在的情况更不可思议
<20-8,ESPOSITO>than what we're already dealing with.

315
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,120
<20-9,CASTLE>好的
<20-9,CASTLE>Okay.

316
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:52,430
<20-9,CASTLE>我觉得
<20-9,CASTLE>I think...

317
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:58,210
<20-10,CASTLE>不得不承认  我现在完全高见无能
<20-10,CASTLE>I'm man enough to admit I'm completely theory-less.

318
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,730
<20-11,RYAN>也许安妮塔受到了什么精神伤害
<20-11,RYAN>Maybe Anita suffered some kind of psychotic break.

319
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:04,080
<20-12,BECKETT>我已经叫了人给她做精神评估
<20-12,BECKETT>I've ordered a psych eval,

320
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,270
<20-12,BECKETT>但是精神病也解释不了
<20-12,BECKETT>but psychosis doesn't explain

321
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:07,100
<20-12,BECKETT>她是怎么知道谋杀案的细节的
<20-12,BECKETT>How she knew all about the murder.

322
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,790
<20-13,ESPOSITO>或者她为什么要杀他
<20-13,ESPOSITO>Or why she killed the guy in the first place.

323
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,040
<20-13,ESPOSITO>我反复查过她的通话记录
<20-13,ESPOSITO>I double-checked her phone records.

324
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,400
<20-13,ESPOSITO>她和贾斯汀·马奎特并没有
<20-13,ESPOSITO>There's not a single call or text

325
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,910
<20-13,ESPOSITO>任何的通话或者短信往来
<20-13,ESPOSITO>between her and Justin Marquette.

326
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:14,270
<20-13,ESPOSITO>看上去他们两个之前根本不认识对方
<20-13,ESPOSITO>It's like they had no history at all.

327
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:15,900
<20-14,BECKETT>好的  你们两个去她的住处
<20-14,BECKETT>Okay, why don't you guys go over to her apartment

328
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,360
<20-14,BECKETT>核查她的电子邮件  日程表  日记
<20-14,BECKETT>and check everything -- e-mails, calendars, her diary --

329
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,020
<20-14,BECKETT>看看是否能发现什么
<20-14,BECKETT>And let's see if we can find anything there

330
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,350
<20-14,BECKETT>把她和被害人联系在一起
<20-14,BECKETT>that'll connect her to our victim.

331
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,270
<20-15,RYAN>马上去办
<20-15,RYAN>We're on it.

332
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,220
<20-16,DOC HOLLOWAY>贝克特探长  卡塞尔先生  很高兴见到你们
<20-16,DOC HOLLOWAY>Detective Beckett, Mr. Castle, good to see you.

333
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,560
<20-17,BECKETT>霍洛维医生  多谢你跑一趟
<20-17,BECKETT>Thank you so much for coming in, Dr. Holloway.

334
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,180
<20-18,HOLLOWAY>你们这儿有位病人在等我吧
<20-18,HOLLOWAY>I gather you have a patient for me.

335
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,100
<20-19,CASTLE>没错
<20-19,CASTLE>Oh, yeah.

336
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,600
<21-1,RYAN>我们搜遍了这房子的所有房间
<21-1,RYAN>Well, we've been through every room in the house.

337
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:38,630
<21-1,RYAN>没发现枪和沾血衣物
<21-1,RYAN>No gun, no bloody clothes,

338
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:41,650
<21-1,RYAN>找不到证据把安妮塔和凶杀现场或贾斯汀联系起来
<21-1,RYAN>Nothing that links Anita back to that crime scene or to Justin.

339
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,480
<21-2,ESPOSITO>是没找到  但你来看她的日程表
<21-2,ESPOSITO>Maybe not, but check out her date book.

340
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:45,350
<21-2,ESPOSITO>有几页被撕掉了
<21-2,ESPOSITO>Some pages have been ripped out,

341
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,990
<21-2,ESPOSITO>过去两周的日程记录都没了
<21-2,ESPOSITO>including all of the last two weeks.

342
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:48,130
<21-3,RYAN>-两周吗  等等  -没错
<21-3,RYAN>- Two weeks? Wait a minute. - Yeah.

343
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:50,580
<21-3,RYAN>安妮塔说过她过去两周一直很"迷糊"
<21-3,RYAN>That's how long Anita says she's been feeling "Blurry."

344
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,450
<21-5,RYAN>也许她电脑里也有日程表备份
<21-5,RYAN>Maybe she kept a calendar on her computer.

345
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,530
<21-5,RYAN>看  她确实备份了
<21-5,RYAN>Yeah, looks like she did,

346
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:01,180
<21-5,RYAN>但过去两周的记录也被抹掉了
<21-5,RYAN>but the same two weeks have been erased.

347
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,130
<21-6,ESPOSITO>看起来有人想掩盖什么
<21-6,ESPOSITO>Seems like someone's trying to cover something up.

348
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:04,640
<21-7,RYAN>是谁呢  想掩盖什么
<21-7,RYAN>Yeah, but who? And what?

349
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,650
<22-1,CASTLE>尽管我也喜欢身陷谜局
<22-1,CASTLE>As much as I love a good mystery,

350
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:11,700
<22-1,CASTLE>但我还是有点希望他能让我们弄清楚
<22-1,CASTLE>a small part of me is hoping he can give us some clarity

351
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,610
<22-1,CASTLE>这到底是怎么回事
<22-1,CASTLE>on what the hell is going on.

352
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,180
<22-2,BECKETT>说到弄清楚  你说
<22-2,BECKETT>Uh, speaking of clarity, what did you mean

353
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:18,200
<22-2,BECKETT>阿丽克西斯可能因为其它事情
<22-2,BECKETT>when you said that there might be something else

354
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,760
<22-2,BECKETT>不搬回你的公寓  是指什么事
<22-2,BECKETT>that's keeping alexis from moving back to your loft?

355
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,480
<22-2,BECKETT>我也不知道
<22-2,BECKETT>I don't know!

356
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,990
<22-3,CASTLE>阿丽克西斯不肯讲  我想...
<22-3,CASTLE>And Alexis won't talk about it, so...

357
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,890
<22-3,CASTLE>或许等霍洛维医生和安妮塔谈完
<22-3,CASTLE>maybe when Dr. Holloway's done talking to Anita,

358
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:27,290
<22-3,CASTLE>可以让他和阿丽克西斯去聊聊
<22-3,CASTLE>I can get him to talk to Alexis.

359
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,600
<22-4,BECKETT>医生  你的判断如何
<22-4,BECKETT>Hey. So, what's the verdict?

360
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,390
<22-5,HOLLOWAY>目前  据我观察
<22-5,HOLLOWAY>Based on my examination so far,

362
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:36,760
<22-5,HOLLOWAY>她精神状态正常  但有些混乱
<22-5,HOLLOWAY>I find her to be mentally competent, if somewhat disoriented.

363
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,820
<22-5,HOLLOWAY>从所有迹象来看  她似乎讲的是实话
<22-5,HOLLOWAY>By all indications, she seems to be telling the truth.

364
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:41,250
<22-6,BECKETT>就是说她确实杀了贾斯汀·马奎特
<22-6,BECKETT>Meaning she did kill Justin Marquette?

365
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,720
<22-7,HOLLOWAY>要不就是她深信是她杀的
<22-7,HOLLOWAY>Or she believes she did, anyway.

366
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,160
<22-8,CASTLE>那混乱呢
<22-8,CASTLE>And what about the disorientation?

367
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,150
<22-8,CASTLE>是怎么导致的
<22-8,CASTLE>How do you account for that?

368
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:47,020
<22-9,HOLLOWAY>可能是身体或神经问题
<22-9,HOLLOWAY>Could be medical or a neurologic condition,

369
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,550
<22-9,HOLLOWAY>或者是对药物的不良反应
<22-9,HOLLOWAY>adverse reaction to drugs.

370
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:50,940
<22-9,HOLLOWAY>可能她经历了创伤性事件
<22-9,HOLLOWAY>It's possible she experienced a traumatic event

371
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,300
<22-9,HOLLOWAY>导致了逆行性遗忘
<22-9,HOLLOWAY>which caused some sort of retrograde amnesia.

372
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,460
<22-10,BECKETT>像杀人这样的创伤性事件吗
<22-10,BECKETT>So, traumatic like killing someone?

373
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,430
<22-11,HOLLOWAY>有可能  我会做个详细检查
<22-11,HOLLOWAY>Potentially. I'm gonna do a full work-up.

374
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:58,910
<22-11,HOLLOWAY>结论出来才会知道更多
<22-11,HOLLOWAY>I'll know more when the results come back.

375
00:13:59,030 --> 00:13:59,610
<22-12,BECKETT>谢谢你  医生
<22-12,BECKETT>Thank you, doctor.

376
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:04,780
<22-13,CASTLE>安妮塔·米勒深信她杀了死者
<22-13,CASTLE>So, Anita Miller believes she killed the victim,

377
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,300
<22-13,CASTLE>但事实证明不可能是她
<22-13,CASTLE>but the facts say she couldn't have.

378
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,410
<22-14,BECKETT>不  不是所有的事实
<22-14,BECKETT>No, not all the facts.

379
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:10,320
<22-14,BECKETT>我们知道她在咖啡店外和贾斯汀搭话
<22-14,BECKETT>I mean, we know she accosted Justin outside the coffee shop,

380
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,480
<22-14,BECKETT>她供认了谋杀罪行
<22-14,BECKETT>she confessed to the murder,

381
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,580
<22-14,BECKETT>而且她十分清楚谋杀过程
<22-14,BECKETT>and she has intimate knowledge of the crime.

382
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:18,350
<22-14,BECKETT>很显然  我们现在还没办法解释一切  但
<22-14,BECKETT>So, look. Clearly, we haven't explained everything, but --

383
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:19,900
<22-15,CASTLE>但你认为她是凶手
<22-15,CASTLE>But you believe she killed him.

384
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:23,630
<22-16,BECKETT>我认为除非事态有变
<22-16,BECKETT>I think that until something changes,

385
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:25,310
<22-16,BECKETT>否则她有最大嫌疑
<22-16,BECKETT>she's our best suspect.

386
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:28,230
<22-16,BECKETT>警探  你得和这人谈谈
<22-16,BECKETT>Detective, there's someone here you need to talk to.

387
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,820
<22-16,BECKETT>这是萨姆·卡森
<22-16,BECKETT>This is Sam Carson.

388
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:31,130
<22-16,BECKETT>把你对我讲的跟她说一遍
<22-16,BECKETT>Tell her what you told me.

389
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:33,310
<23-1,SAM CARSON>我想供认一起谋杀案
<23-1,SAM CARSON>I want to confess to a murder.

390
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:36,230
<23-1,SAM CARSON>我杀了贾斯汀·马奎特
<23-1,SAM CARSON>I killed Justin Marquette.

391
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,150
<23-2,CASTLE>我想事态有变了
<23-2,CASTLE>I'd say something just changed.

392
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:44,690
<24-1,SAM>对  是我
<24-1,SAM>Yeah, it was me.

393
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,860
<24-1,SAM>别误会  我并不是以此为荣
<24-1,SAM>Don't get me wrong -- it's not like I'm proud of it.

394
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:47,930
<24-2,GATES>我没听错吧
<24-2,GATES>Did I hear right?

395
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:50,230
<24-2,GATES>又有人供认谋杀吗
<24-2,GATES>Another person has confessed to this murder?

396
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:52,560
<24-3,ESPOSITO>对  但我觉得他只是想引人注意罢了
<24-3,ESPOSITO>Yeah, but I just think he's some kind of attention-seeker.

397
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:53,620
<24-4,CASTLE>对  到目前为止  他的供述
<24-4,CASTLE>Yeah -- so far, the confession

398
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:55,050
<24-4,CASTLE>只是重复了新闻报道的内容
<24-4,CASTLE>is just a rehash of the news report.

399
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:56,860
<24-5,BECKETT>卡森先生  你知道
<24-5,BECKETT>Mr. Carson, do you realize

400
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:00,180
<24-5,BECKETT>对警察做假口供是犯法的吗
<24-5,BECKETT>that making false statements to the police is a crime?

401
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,460
<24-6,SAM>我说的是实话
<24-6,SAM>I'm telling you the truth.

402
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,820
<24-6,SAM>我在酒店房间杀了个人
<24-6,SAM>I killed the guy in his hotel room.

403
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:05,420
<25-1,BECKETT>好吧  那是哪个房间
<25-1,BECKETT>Okay, fine. What room was that?

404
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:15,120
<25-1,BECKETT>147  是147房间
<25-1,BECKETT>147. It was room 147.

405
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,020
<25-1,BECKETT>你得告诉我到底发生了什么
<25-1,BECKETT>I need you to tell me exactly what happened.

406
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:24,820
<26-1,BECKETT>我在他房间
<26-1,BECKETT>I was in his room, uh --

407
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,970
<26-2,SAM>不  我要知道细节
<26-2,SAM>No, no. I need details.

408
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:30,030
<26-3,BECKETT>你躲在壁橱里吗  踢开了门吗
<26-3,BECKETT>Were you hiding in the closet? Did you kick down the door?

409
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,790
<26-4,SAM>不  我敲门的
<26-4,SAM>No. I knocked.

410
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,940
<26-4,SAM>恭候你多时了  进来吧
<26-4,SAM>Been waiting for you. Come on in.

411
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:37,710
<26-4,SAM>给你拿点水喝
<26-4,SAM>Let me get you a water.

412
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:40,070
<26-4,SAM>他让我进去了  给我拿了水
<26-4,SAM>He let me in, offered me a water.

413
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:41,800
<26-4,SAM>拿了水
<26-4,SAM>A water?

414
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,450
<26-4,SAM>对  一瓶水
<26-4,SAM>Yeah, like, a bottle.

415
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,850
<26-4,SAM>然后他去了冰箱那儿
<26-4,SAM>Then he -- he went to the fridge.

416
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:46,340
<26-4,SAM>就是那时我掏出了枪
<26-4,SAM>That's when I pulled out my gun.

417
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,730
<26-4,SAM>他转过身来后  我朝他开了枪
<26-4,SAM>He turned around, and I shot him...

418
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:51,360
<29-1,SAM>正中胸口
<29-1,SAM>Right in the chest.

419
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,670
<30-1,BECKETT>然后呢
<30-1,BECKETT>And then what?

420
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,290
<30-2,SAM>他向后倒去  抓住了椅子
<30-2,SAM>He fell back, grabbed for a chair,

421
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:58,600
<30-2,SAM>倒下的时候把椅子也带倒了
<30-2,SAM>Knocked it over when he fell down.

422
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:04,600
<30-2,SAM>然后我就走了
<30-2,SAM>Then I left.

423
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,090
<30-3,BECKETT>你为什么杀他
<30-3,BECKETT>Why did you kill him?

424
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:08,890
<30-4,SAM>为什么
<30-4,SAM>Why?

425
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:09,700
<30-5,BECKETT>对啊
<30-5,BECKETT>Yeah.

426
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,100
<30-6,SAM>因为我很愤怒
<30-6,SAM>'cause I was angry.

427
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,920
<30-6,SAM>我有情绪问题  你懂吧
<30-6,SAM>I got anger issues, you know?

428
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,140
<30-6,SAM>我看到他的时候  就满腔怒火
<30-6,SAM>And when I saw him, I was just so filled with rage.

429
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,120
<30-7,BECKETT>是因为他对你做了什么
<30-7,BECKETT>Because he did what to you?

430
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:24,780
<30-8,SAM>这个  我也没弄明白
<30-8,SAM>That's -- that's the part I'm not too clear on.

431
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,550
<30-8,SAM>前几个星期的事我都记不大清了
<30-8,SAM>The last -- last couple of weeks have been just kind of hazy.

432
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,510
<30-9,BECKETT>你怎么认识死者的
<30-9,BECKETT>How did you know the victim?

433
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,400
<30-10,SAM>我没印象我认识他
<30-10,SAM>I don't -- I don't know that I do.

434
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:41,980
<30-11,BECKETT>那么  他让你十分愤怒  但你根本不认识他吗
<30-11,BECKETT>Okay. He filled you with rage, and you don't know him?

435
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,390
<30-11,BECKETT>那你为什么要去147号房间呢
<30-11,BECKETT>Why did you go to Room147 in the first place?

436
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:46,030
<30-11,BECKETT>-是他联系你的吗  -我忘记了
<30-11,BECKETT>- Did he contact you? - I don't remember.

437
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:48,150
<30-13,BECKETT>你怎么能忘记了呢
<30-13,BECKETT>How do you not remember?

438
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:49,550
<30-13,BECKETT>你在耍什么把戏呢
<30-13,BECKETT>What kind of game are you playing here?

439
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,310
<30-14,SAM>我没有在耍任何把戏
<30-14,SAM>I'm not playing any game!

440
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:51,460
<30-15,BECKETT>你知道我认为你在干什么吗
<30-15,BECKETT>You know what I think you're doing?

441
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,620
<30-15,BECKETT>你在阻挠我办案
<30-15,BECKETT>You're trying to sabotage my case!

442
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:56,040
<30-15,BECKETT>你知道没有检察官会在
<30-15,BECKETT>You know that no D.A. is going to get a conviction

443
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,360
<30-16,SAM>多人供认情况下定罪
<30-16,SAM>with multiple confessions!

444
00:16:58,430 --> 00:16:59,750
<30-16,SAM>多人供认
<30-16,SAM>Multiple confessions?

445
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:02,360
<30-17,BECKETT>没错  你和安妮塔·米勒一起策划的
<30-17,BECKETT>Yeah, you and Anita Miller are working together on this.

446
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,860
<30-17,BECKETT>你们要不是互相为对方掩盖罪行
<30-17,BECKETT>You're either covering for each other,

447
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:06,140
<30-17,BECKETT>就是一起为其他人掩盖罪行
<30-17,BECKETT>or you're covering for someone else out there.

448
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,410
<30-18,SAM>谁是安妮塔·米勒
<30-18,SAM>Who the hell is Anita Miller?

449
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:09,750
<30-19,BECKETT>你知道她是谁
<30-19,BECKETT>You know who she is.

450
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,250
<30-20,SAM>我从没见过这个女人
<30-20,SAM>I've never seen that woman before in my life.

451
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:20,310
<31-1,ANITA>我不认识他
<31-1,ANITA>I'm telling you, I don't know him.

452
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:22,050
<31-2,CASTLE>你确定吗
<31-2,CASTLE>Are you sure about that?

453
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:24,930
<31-3,BECKETT>因为萨姆跟你讲的案发情况一模一样
<31-3,BECKETT>Because Sam told us the same story you did,

454
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:27,170
<31-3,BECKETT>不同的是是他杀了贾斯汀
<31-3,BECKETT>But that he killed Justin.

455
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:30,300
<31-4,ANITA>他在撒谎  我杀了贾斯汀·马奎特
<31-4,ANITA>Well, he's lying. I killed Justin Marquette.

456
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:38,480
<31-4,ANITA>我们没找到萨姆和安妮塔之间的关联
<31-4,ANITA>So, we can't find a link between Sam and Anita,

457
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,280
<32-1,BECKETT>也没找到他们俩和死者之间的关联
<32-1,BECKETT>or between either one of them and our victim.

458
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,430
<32-2,CASTLE>那萨姆的不在场证明呢
<32-2,CASTLE>What about Sam's alibi?

459
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:44,120
<32-3,BECKETT>他的弟弟说他和萨姆
<32-3,BECKETT>His brother says that he and Sam

460
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,630
<32-3,BECKETT>昨晚一整晚都在棒球室内练习场
<32-3,BECKETT>were at the batting cages all last night.

461
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,270
<32-3,BECKETT>而且根据监控录像来看
<32-3,BECKETT>And based on the security video,

462
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:50,260
<32-3,BECKETT>萨姆根本没去过酒店
<32-3,BECKETT>Sam never set foot in the hotel.

463
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,210
<32-4,CASTLE>他们俩都坚信是自己杀了贾斯汀
<32-4,CASTLE>They both believe they killed Justin,

464
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:56,870
<32-4,CASTLE>他们俩都清楚谋杀的细节
<32-4,CASTLE>They both know details about the murder,

465
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:59,390
<32-4,CASTLE>而且他们俩都拥有相同的记忆问题
<32-4,CASTLE>and they both have similar memory problems.

466
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,260
<32-4,CASTLE>这其中必有关联
<32-4,CASTLE>I mean, they must be connected.

467
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:05,540
<32-4,CASTLE>假如是他们的生活确有交集  只不过不是
<32-4,CASTLE>What if their lives intersect, just not in such a...

468
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:06,750
<32-4,CASTLE>一般的那种交集呢
<32-4,CASTLE>literal sense?

469
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:07,770
<32-5,BECKETT>不要说  卡塞尔  求你了
<32-5,BECKETT>No. Castle, no. Please.

470
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:09,910
<32-5,BECKETT>如果你又要说平行宇宙理论
<32-5,BECKETT>If this is some alternate-universe theory,

471
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,080
<32-5,BECKETT>我可没心情听
<32-5,BECKETT>I'm not in the mood.

472
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:11,890
<32-5,BECKETT>真的吗
<32-5,BECKETT>Really?

473
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,810
<32-6,CASTLE>平行宇宙  你也太小瞧我了
<32-6,CASTLE>Alternate universe -- that's how little you think of me.

474
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,080
<32-7,BECKETT>对不起  对不起
<32-7,BECKETT>I'm sorry. I'm -- I'm sorry.

475
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:17,710
<32-7,BECKETT>我只是  我以为你要
<32-7,BECKETT>I just -- I thought that you --

476
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:19,870
<32-8,CASTLE>不是  他们俩是心灵相通的
<32-8,CASTLE>No, they're psychically linked.

477
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,550
<32-9,CASTLE>而且不是彼此相通  而是和真正的凶手相通
<32-9,CASTLE>And not just to each other, but to the actual killer.

478
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,680
<32-9,CASTLE>他们是通过他或她的眼看到了犯罪过程
<32-9,CASTLE>See, they're seeing the crime through his or her eyes.

479
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,220
<32-9,CASTLE>这种感觉实在是太身临其境了
<32-9,CASTLE>And the experience is so visceral

480
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:30,300
<32-9,CASTLE>以至于让萨姆和安妮塔
<32-9,CASTLE>that both Sam and Anita

481
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,280
<32-9,CASTLE>都认为他们自己才是杀人凶手
<32-9,CASTLE>think that they committed the crime themselves.

482
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:37,230
<32-10,BECKETT>对不起  我只是  你兴奋了
<32-10,BECKETT>I'm sorry. It's just, you got excited.

483
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:38,660
<32-11,CASTLE>-看起来有点可爱  -是是
<32-11,CASTLE>- It's kind of cute. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

484
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,120
<32-11,CASTLE>你知道我有多喜欢奇怪的事情
<32-11,CASTLE>You know how I like the weird stuff.

485
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:43,080
<32-12,CASTLE>谁的短信
<32-12,CASTLE>Who's that?

486
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:46,330
<32-13,BECKETT>没人  没什么事
<32-13,BECKETT>Oh, uh, it's nobody. Nothing.

487
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:47,430
<32-13,BECKETT>没什么事
<32-13,BECKETT>It's -- it's nothing.

488
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:48,640
<32-13,BECKETT>警探
<32-13,BECKETT>Detective?

489
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,770
<32-13,BECKETT>又来了一个
<32-13,BECKETT>We got another one.

490
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:52,050
<33-1,BECKETT>又一个什么
<33-1,BECKETT>Another what?

491
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:54,420
<33-2,DWIGHT CARRUTHERS>我叫德怀特·卡瑟斯  是注册会计师
<33-2,DWIGHT CARRUTHERS>I'm Dwight Carruthers, cpa.

492
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,360
<33-2,DWIGHT CARRUTHERS>我来自首
<33-2,DWIGHT CARRUTHERS>I'm here to turn myself in...

493
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:59,100
<33-2,DWIGHT CARRUTHERS>我杀害了贾斯汀·马奎特
<33-2,DWIGHT CARRUTHERS>...for killing Justin Marquette.

494
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:01,760
<33-3,BECKETT>-不会吧  -好了
<33-3,BECKETT>- No. - All right.

495
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:04,690
<33-4,CASTLE>这个案子现在正式  无与伦比了
<33-4,CASTLE>This is now officially...outstanding.

496
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:08,590
<33-5,RYAN>你们要来看看这个
<33-5,RYAN>Hey. You guys need to see this.

497
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,600
<33-6,DWIGHT>等等  我需要供认
<33-6,DWIGHT>Wait, I-I need to confess.

498
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,900
<33-7,BECKETT>是嘛  排队去吧
<33-7,BECKETT>Yeah, take a number.

499
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:16,740
<34-1,RYAN>一旦我们意识到有可能
<34-1,RYAN>Once we realized that someone

500
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,240
<34-1,RYAN>有人去过安妮塔的公寓
<34-1,RYAN>might've gone through Anita's apartment,

501
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,140
<34-1,RYAN>我们让警员排查了那一块区域
<34-1,RYAN>We had UNIs canvass the area.

502
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:23,470
<34-1,RYAN>安妮塔的一个邻居记得两周前
<34-1,RYAN>Now, one of Anita's neighbors remembers seeing a red van

503
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,380
<34-1,RYAN>看到过一辆红色货车停在她家门口
<34-1,RYAN>parked outside her place about two weeks ago.

504
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,550
<34-2,BECKETT>就是从那时起她开始感觉意识混乱的
<34-2,BECKETT>Right when she started feeling disoriented.

505
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:30,760
<34-3,RYAN>是的  不止如此  我们问过萨姆·卡森的邻居
<34-3,RYAN>Yeah, not only that, we checked in with Sam Carson's neighbors.

506
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:33,100
<34-3,RYAN>结果发现其中一个人也记得几天后
<34-3,RYAN>Turns out, one of them remembers seeing the same red van

507
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,350
<34-3,RYAN>看到过一辆相同的红色货车停在卡森家外
<34-3,RYAN>parked outside of Carson's house a few nights later.

508
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:37,440
<34-3,RYAN>她之所以记得是因为他觉得货车看起来很可疑
<34-3,RYAN>She remembers it because she thought it looked suspicious.

509
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,730
<34-4,BECKETT>你知道车牌号吗
<34-4,BECKETT>Did you get a plate number?

510
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:41,810
<34-5,RYAN>不知道  但她用她的手机照了一张相
<34-5,RYAN>No, but she took a picture with her phone.

511
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:43,180
<34-5,RYAN>看看谁在驾驶
<34-5,RYAN>Take a look who's behind the wheel.

512
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:46,540
<34-6,CASTLE>这不是
<34-6,CASTLE>Is that...

513
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:48,670
<34-7,BECKETT>一个大块头秃顶男人
<34-7,BECKETT>A big, bald man,

514
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:50,410
<34-7,BECKETT>就跟安妮塔声称她看见
<34-7,BECKETT>just like the one Anita said she saw

515
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:52,770
<34-7,BECKETT>和死者在咖啡店外交谈的人一样
<34-7,BECKETT>talking to our victim outside the coffee shop.

516
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,280
<34-8,CASTLE>那么死者和两个嫌疑犯之间
<34-8,CASTLE>So our victim and two suspects

517
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,860
<34-8,CASTLE>的确是有关联之处的
<34-8,CASTLE>do have something in common.

518
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:58,020
<34-9,BECKETT>没错  就是他
<34-9,BECKETT>Yeah -- him.

519
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:03,310
<35-1,GATES>-那么现在有三个人自首了  -是的  长官
<35-1,GATES>- So, now there are three of them. - Yes, sir.

520
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:06,880
<35-2,BECKETT>但是我们相信这个男人就是案子的关键
<35-2,BECKETT>But we believe that this man is the key to our case.

521
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,760
<35-2,BECKETT>他的货车分别在安妮塔和萨姆的公寓外被人看到过
<35-2,BECKETT>His van was seen outside both Anita and Sam's apartments,

522
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,440
<35-2,BECKETT>并且安妮塔认出他是
<35-2,BECKETT>And Anita I.D.'d him as the guy

523
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,080
<35-2,BECKETT>和死者在咖啡店外交谈的那个人
<35-2,BECKETT>that was talking to our victim outside the coffee shop.

524
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,720
<35-3,GATES>这个男人和卡瑟斯先生有什么关系
<35-3,GATES>And what is this man's connection to Mr. Carruthers?

525
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,330
<35-4,BECKETT>这就是我要去查明的
<35-4,BECKETT>That's what I'm gonna find out.

526
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:24,110
<36-1,DWIGHT>我已经准备好了负全部责任
<36-1,DWIGHT>I-I'm prepared to take full responsibility

527
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,220
<36-1,DWIGHT>并对自己所做的一切供认不讳
<36-1,DWIGHT>and admit to what I did.

528
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:28,000
<36-2,BECKETT>我相信  你认识这个男人吗
<36-2,BECKETT>Yes, I'm sure you are. Now, do you recognize this man?

529
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,330
<36-3,DWIGHT>你不想听我的供述吗
<36-3,DWIGHT>Don't you want to hear my confession?

530
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:31,360
<36-4,BECKETT>最佳旅伴酒店  147号房间
<36-4,BECKETT>Best traveler hotel, room 147,

531
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,370
<36-4,BECKETT>贾斯汀给了你一瓶水  你一枪打死了他
<36-4,BECKETT>Justin offered you water, and then you shot him.

532
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,610
<36-5,DWIGHT>你是怎么知道的
<36-5,DWIGHT>How -- how did you know?

533
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:40,010
<36-6,CASTLE>贝克特  这跟安妮塔画的一样
<36-6,CASTLE>Beckett? Just like the one Anita drew.

534
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,830
<36-7,BECKETT>德怀特  这个符号是什么意义
<36-7,BECKETT>Dwight, what does that symbol mean?

535
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:43,130
<36-8,DWIGHT>我不知道
<36-8,DWIGHT>I -- uh, uh, I don't -- I don't know.

536
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:44,940
<36-8,DWIGHT>它最近一直浮现在我的脑海里
<36-8,DWIGHT>It's just been stuck in my head lately.

537
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,090
<36-8,DWIGHT>但是就算知道又能怎么样呢
<36-8,DWIGHT>But what difference does that make?

538
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,190
<36-8,DWIGHT>-我枪杀了一个人  -我们知道
<36-8,DWIGHT>- I-I shot a guy! - We know.

539
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:49,930
<36-9,BECKETT>你能仔细看看这些照片吗
<36-9,BECKETT>Now, can you take a close look at these pictures

540
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:51,600
<36-9,BECKETT>告诉我们你见过这个男人吗
<36-9,BECKETT>And tell me if you recognize that man?

541
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:55,880
<36-10,DWIGHT>没有  但是货车看起来很熟悉
<36-10,DWIGHT>Uh...no, but the van looks familiar.

542
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:57,580
<36-11,CASTLE>你以前见过吗  哪里见到的
<36-11,CASTLE>You've seen it before? Where?

543
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,780
<36-12,DWIGHT>我不是很清楚
<36-12,DWIGHT>Uh, I'm not sure.

544
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,370
<36-12,DWIGHT>最近有点
<36-12,DWIGHT>I've -- I've been --

545
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:03,300
<36-13,CASTLE>稀里糊涂的  就这最近两周
<36-13,CASTLE>Confused recently, like the last two weeks?

546
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,530
<36-14,BECKETT>德怀特  认真想  这很重要
<36-14,BECKETT>Dwight, think. This is important.

547
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,490
<36-15,DWIGHT>那  那是上周二  大约中午
<36-15,DWIGHT>It -- it was last tuesday... a-around noon.

548
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:13,660
<36-15,DWIGHT>我从自信训练班回家
<36-15,DWIGHT>I was coming home from... assertiveness training,

549
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,920
<36-15,DWIGHT>那辆货车停在豪士顿街上
<36-15,DWIGHT>And -- and that van was parked on Houston Street

550
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,360
<36-15,DWIGHT>就在我公寓外面
<36-15,DWIGHT>outside my apartment.

551
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,210
<36-16,BECKETT>豪士顿街上有交通摄像头
<36-16,BECKETT>There are traffic cams on Houston.

552
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:20,770
<36-16,BECKETT>说不定拍到了车牌号
<36-16,BECKETT>They might've caught a plate number.

553
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,000
<36-16,BECKETT>你们不是吧
<36-16,BECKETT>Um...seriously?

554
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:27,190
<36-17,DWIGHT>我杀了人  你们却只关心货车
<36-17,DWIGHT>I killed someone, and all you care about is a van?

555
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:30,020
<37-1,RYAN>技术人员搜索了上周二以来豪士顿街
<37-1,RYAN>All right. Techs scrubbed traffic cam footage

556
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,170
<37-1,RYAN>交通摄像头拍下的影像资料
<37-1,RYAN>from last tuesday on Houston.

<37-2,ESPOSITO>It's registered to a Miles Madsen.

<37-3,BECKETT>太好了  那就是我们要找的人
<37-3,BECKETT>Great. That's our guy.

560
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:36,630
<37-3,BECKETT>我们还知道他什么
<37-3,BECKETT>So, what do we know about him?

561
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:38,480
<37-4,ESPOSITO>他在逃  警员搜查了他的公寓
<37-4,ESPOSITO>That he's in the wind -- uniforms hit his apartment,

<37-4,ESPOSITO>可房东说已经好几周没见过马德森了
<37-4,ESPOSITO>but the landlord said he hasn't seen Madsen in weeks.

563
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,220
<37-5,BECKETT>好吧  发全面通缉
<37-5,BECKETT>Okay, put out an APB.

<37-5,BECKETT>Find out everything you can about him.

565
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,790
<37-5,BECKETT>现在  他是将这些人连在一起的唯一一环
<37-5,BECKETT>Right now, he's the only link connecting all these people.

566
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:49,730
<37-6,ESPOSITO>你要去哪里
<37-6,ESPOSITO>Where you going?

00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,190
<38-6,ALEXIS>是这样的
<38-6,ALEXIS>Okay, well...

576
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:26,260
<38-7,BECKETT>你爸爸想让你搬回来住
<38-7,BECKETT>Your dad wants you to move back home.

577
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,730
<38-7,BECKETT>我知道你说你租房合同还没到期
<38-7,BECKETT>And I know that you said you have a lease,

578
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:31,380
<38-7,BECKETT>可你又说你还有些其他原因
<38-7,BECKETT>but you also said that there were other reasons

579
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,830
<38-7,BECKETT>你为什么不想搬回来呢  我只是
<38-7,BECKETT>why you didn't want to move back, and I-I just...

580
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:38,850
<38-7,BECKETT>想确认你不想回来的原因不是我
<38-7,BECKETT>I want to make sure that one of those reasons isn't me.

581
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:40,910
<38-8,ALEXIS>不
<38-8,ALEXIS>Oh, no.

582
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,080
<38-8,ALEXIS>不不  完全不是因为你
<38-8,ALEXIS>No, no, it's -- it's not you at all.

583
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,590
<38-8,ALEXIS>你确定吗
<38-8,ALEXIS>Are you sure?

584
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,990
<38-9,BECKETT>因为我最不愿意见到的就是
<38-9,BECKETT>'cause the last thing I want to do

585
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:50,370
<38-9,BECKETT>我让你在你自己家感到不受欢迎
<38-9,BECKETT>is make you feel unwelcome in your own home.

586
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:53,870
<38-8,ALEXIS>不是因为你  是因为我自己
<38-8,ALEXIS>No, it's... not you, it's me.

587
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:57,930
<38-10,ALEXIS>我搬出去时  我爸对我说的那些话
<38-10,ALEXIS>All those things my dad said when I was moving out --

588
00:22:57,930 --> 00:23:01,570
<38-10,ALEXIS>说我搬出去和男友住是错误的决定
<38-10,ALEXIS>About me making a mistake moving in with my boyfriend --

589
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:02,730
<38-10,ALEXIS>他说的对
<38-10,ALEXIS>He was right.

590
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,540
<38-10,ALEXIS>我现在全都明白了
<38-10,ALEXIS>I can see it so clearly now.

591
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,340
<38-10,ALEXIS>为什么那时就不明白呢
<38-10,ALEXIS>Why didn't I then?

592
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,070
<38-11,BECKETT>你那时身处爱情迷雾之中
<38-11,BECKETT>You were in the love haze.

593
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:11,350
<38-12,ALEXIS>爱情迷雾
<38-12,ALEXIS>The love haze?

594
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:12,360
<38-12,ALEXIS>爱情就像毒品
<38-12,ALEXIS>It's like a drug!

595
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:16,150
<38-13,BECKETT>会让聪明人做出愚蠢的事情
<38-13,BECKETT>It makes intelligent people do stupid things.

596
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,770
<38-13,BECKETT>当迷雾都散开  你瞧瞧周围
<38-13,BECKETT>Then it clears, and you look around,

597
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:20,020
<38-13,BECKETT>你便会想  我这之前怎么想的
<38-13,BECKETT>and you wonder, "What was I thinking?"

598
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:22,450
<38-13,BECKETT>你爸爸只是想帮助你
<38-13,BECKETT>Your dad just wants to help.

599
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,070
<38-13,BECKETT>应该让他出手相助
<38-13,BECKETT>It's okay to let him.

600
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:28,000
<38-14,ALEXIS>是的  不过这是我犯的错误
<38-14,ALEXIS>Yes, but this was my mistake.

601
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:29,550
<38-14,ALEXIS>他不应该为此埋单
<38-14,ALEXIS>He shouldn't have to pay for it,

602
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,460
<38-14,ALEXIS>我要继续兼职家教
<38-14,ALEXIS>so I will tutor

603
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:34,900
<38-14,ALEXIS>尽我所能直到合同结束
<38-14,ALEXIS>and do whatever I have to until the lease is up.

604
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,700
<38-14,ALEXIS>好吧
<38-14,ALEXIS>Okay.

605
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:38,950
<38-15,BECKETT>我明白  听我说
<38-15,BECKETT>I get it. Look.

606
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:42,590
<38-15,BECKETT>你做的这些看似很高尚  可惜不是
<38-15,BECKETT>I know what you're doing seems noble, but it's not.

607
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,270
<38-15,BECKETT>长时间的工作  精疲力竭
<38-15,BECKETT>I mean, the long hours, the exhaustion --

608
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:48,330
<38-15,BECKETT>你这么做其实是惩罚自己
<38-15,BECKETT>What you're actually doing is punishing yourself.

609
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:51,030
<38-15,BECKETT>相信我  我曾和你处境一样
<38-15,BECKETT>Trust me. I've been there.

610
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:56,800
<38-16,BECKETT>这没有必要
<38-16,BECKETT>This -- this isn't necessary.

611
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:00,350
<38-16,BECKETT>你爸爸很爱你
<38-16,BECKETT>Your dad loves you.

612
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,860
<38-16,BECKETT>他很担心你
<38-16,BECKETT>He worries about you.

613
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,310
<38-16,BECKETT>你的悔过已经足够了
<38-16,BECKETT>I think your penance is paid.

615
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:13,210
<38-17,BECKETT>抱歉  我得走了
<38-17,BECKETT>I'm sorry. I have to go.

616
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:16,240
<38-17,BECKETT>考虑下  好吗
<38-17,BECKETT>Uh, just think about it, okay?

617
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:19,090
<38-18,BECKETT>回见
<38-18,BECKETT>I'll see you.

618
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,310
<39-1,BECKETT>你们找到马德森了吗

<39-2,ESPOSITO>没有  不过就快了
<39-2,ESPOSITO>No, but we're getting close.

620
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:29,010
<39-2,ESPOSITO>我们发现他是阿波罗尖峰公司的
<39-2,ESPOSITO>We figured out that he's an independent contractor

621
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:31,040
<39-2,ESPOSITO>独立承包人
<39-2,ESPOSITO>for Apollo Pinnacle, Inc.,

622
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,160
<39-3,RYAN>这家公司是
<39-3,RYAN>which turns out to be a front

623
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,380
<39-3,RYAN>永恒视野组织的幌子公司
<39-3,RYAN>for another organization called E.H.I.,

624
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,510
<39-3,RYAN>全称是永恒视野研究所
<39-3,RYAN>or Eternal Horizons Institute.

625
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:37,550
<39-4,BECKETT>那是什么
<39-4,BECKETT>And what is that?

626
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:39,660
<39-5,RYAN>引用他们网站的原话
<39-5,RYAN>Well, to quote their website,

627
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:41,870
<39-5,RYAN>"该研究所提供庇护  启蒙
<39-5,RYAN>"E.H.I. provides sanctuary, enlightenment,

628
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:43,690
<39-5,RYAN>以及通向终极自我的道路"
<39-5,RYAN>and pathways to the ultimate self."

629
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:46,040
<39-5,RYAN>他们声称在全球范围内有上千名追随者
<39-5,RYAN>They claim to have thousands of followers all over the world.

630
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,840
<39-6,ESPOSITO>不过不是所有人都满意他们的服务
<39-6,ESPOSITO>But not all of them are satisfied customers.

631
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,690
<39-6,ESPOSITO>在2005年  三名追随者
<39-6,ESPOSITO>In 2005, three of those followers died

632
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:52,100
<39-6,ESPOSITO>死于某种蒸汗屋入会仪式
<39-6,ESPOSITO>in some kind of sweat-lodge initiation.

633
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:53,500
<39-6,ESPOSITO>虽然该组织遭到起诉
<39-6,ESPOSITO>Charges were filed, but, ultimately,

634
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,010
<39-6,ESPOSITO>但最终法院还是裁定属于意外死亡
<39-6,ESPOSITO>the deaths were ruled accidental.

635
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:57,900
<39-7,BECKETT>追随者  入会仪式  听起来像是邪教
<39-7,BECKETT>Followers? Initiations? This thing sounds like a cult.

636
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,100
<39-8,CASTLE>是个邪教
<39-8,CASTLE>Oh, it's a cult, all right,

00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:27,610
<41-13,BAUER>恐怕不认识
<41-13,BAUER>I'm afraid not.

688
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:31,400
<41-14,BECKETT>那这个人呢  迈尔斯·马德森
<41-14,BECKETT>What about this man, Miles Madsen?

689
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,100
<41-14,BECKETT>我知道他为你工作
<41-14,BECKETT>I understand he works for you.

690
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:37,970
<41-15,BAUER>马德森先生不为永恒视野工作已有段时间了
<41-15,BAUER>Mr. Madsen has not been employed by E.H.I. for some time --

691
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:39,640
<41-15,BAUER>准确地说  有些年了
<41-15,BAUER>Years, in fact.

692
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,310
<41-16,CASTLE>马德森受雇于你时工作内容是什么
<41-16,CASTLE>Well, what did mr. Madsen do when he worked for you?

693
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:44,620
<41-17,BAUER>鉴于他已不再受雇于我
<41-17,BAUER>Since he is no longer in my employ,

694
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,280
<41-17,BAUER>我不知问这个有何关联
<41-17,BAUER>I don't see the relevance.

695
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,160
<41-18,BECKETT>关系就在于
<41-18,BECKETT>The relevance

696
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:50,090
<41-18,BECKETT>他牵涉进了一桩凶杀案
<41-18,BECKETT>Is that he is connected to a murder investigation.

697
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:54,060
<41-19,BAUER>你浓厚的敌意令我震惊  探长
<41-19,BAUER>I'm struck by the level of your hostility, Detective.

698
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:55,560
<41-19,BAUER>这不利健康
<41-19,BAUER>It's not healthy.

699
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:59,180
<41-20,CASTLE>一名凶杀组探长询问你雇员的情况
<41-20,CASTLE>You know what I'm struck by is your total lack of curiosity

700
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:03,230
<41-20,CASTLE>你却毫不忧心  这才叫人震惊呢
<41-20,CASTLE>as to why a homicide detective is asking about your employee.

701
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:04,710
<41-21,BAUER>是前雇员
<41-21,BAUER>Former employee.

702
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:07,550
<41-22,BECKETT>随便他是什么  总之他与这个案子有牵连
<41-22,BECKETT>Well, whatever he is, he is definitely involved in this case,

703
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:11,220
<41-22,BECKETT>此外还牵涉到三人  都是你这个小组的
<41-22,BECKETT>along with three other members of your...little group --

704
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:14,540
<41-22,BECKETT>安妮塔·米勒  萨姆·卡森  德怀特·卡瑟斯
<41-22,BECKETT>Anita Miller, Sam Carson, Dwight Carruthers.

705
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:16,460
<41-23,BAUER>抱歉  探长
<41-23,BAUER>I'm sorry, Detective.

706
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:19,270
<41-23,BAUER>这些人不是永恒视野的成员
<41-23,BAUER>Those people are not part of E.H.I.

707
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,590
<41-24,CASTLE>这真是
<41-24,CASTLE>Wow. That's...

708
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:22,540
<41-24,CASTLE>你查都不查就知道
<41-24,CASTLE>amazing how you would just know that

709
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,840
<41-24,CASTLE>还真让人惊奇
<41-24,CASTLE>off the top of your head.

710
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:28,070
<41-25,BAUER>我亲自接见本组织每个成员
<41-25,BAUER>I make a point of meeting every member of my E.H.I. family.

711
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:30,440
<41-25,BAUER>你提到的这三位不在其中
<41-25,BAUER>The people you mentioned are not among them.

712
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:31,470
<41-26,BECKETT>那想必你不会介意
<41-26,BECKETT>Well, then, I'm sure you won't mind

713
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,370
<41-26,BECKETT>我们搜查下你的档案
<41-26,BECKETT>if we check your files,

714
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:35,150
<41-26,BECKETT>以及你存有的迈尔斯·马德森的文件
<41-26,BECKETT>along with the records that you have on Miles Madsen.

715
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,660
<41-27,BAUER>那你就需要搜查令了  探长
<41-27,BAUER>You'd need a warrant for that, Detective,

716
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:39,470
<41-27,BAUER>但你申请不到的
<41-27,BAUER>and you won't get one.

717
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,050
<41-27,BAUER>怎么了
<41-27,BAUER>What's that?

718
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,850
<41-28,BAUER>他们准备好了
<41-28,BAUER>They're ready.

719
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:46,560
<41-28,BAUER>真抱歉  研讨会要开始了
<41-28,BAUER>I'm sorry. My session is starting.

720
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,170
<41-28,BAUER>贾思敏会送两位离开
<41-28,BAUER>Jasmine will show you out.

721
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:50,660
<41-29,BECKETT>等下  鲍尔博士  我
<41-29,BECKETT>No. Dr. Bauer, I -- uh --

722
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,070
<41-30,RECEPTIONIST>这边请
<41-30,RECEPTIONIST>Right this way.

723
00:28:58,250 --> 00:28:59,550
<42-1,BECKETT>让鲍尔说着了
<42-1,BECKETT>Bauer was right.

724
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:01,940
<42-1,BECKETT>法官不肯签发搜查令
<42-1,BECKETT>The judge turned us down for a search warrant.

725
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:04,690
<42-2,RYAN>你真以为永恒天视野的"大教主"是背后主谋
<42-2,RYAN>You really think E.H.I.'s grand pooh-bah is behind this?

726
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:07,470
<42-3,BECKETT>我认为他知道马德森在哪
<42-3,BECKETT>I think that he knows where Madsen is

727
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:09,290
<42-3,BECKETT>而且马德森还在替他卖命
<42-3,BECKETT>and that Madsen is still working for him.

728
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:10,080
<42-4,RYAN>做什么呢
<42-4,RYAN>But doing what?

729
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:11,880
<42-4,RYAN>而这种种又和
<42-4,RYAN>And what does any of this have to do

730
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,770
<42-4,RYAN>落魄演员贾斯汀·马奎特有什么关系
<42-4,RYAN>with a struggling actor like Justin Marquette?

731
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:15,870
<42-6,BECKETT>-哈  -"哈"什么
<42-6,BECKETT>- Huh. - "Huh" what?

732
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:17,790
<42-7,CASTLE>永恒视野官网
<42-7,CASTLE>Uh, the E.H.I. website --

733
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:20,050
<42-7,CASTLE>简介里说他们设有各种课程
<42-7,CASTLE>the testimonials claim that they have programs

734
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:22,900
<42-7,CASTLE>以帮助人们戒烟  戒酒  以及
<42-7,CASTLE>that help people quit smoking, quit drinking, uh,

735
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,370
<42-7,CASTLE>重新掌控生活
<42-7,CASTLE>take charge of their lives.

736
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:25,040
<42-8,RYAN>所以呢
<42-8,RYAN>So?

737
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,380
<42-9,CASTLE>这三个自首的人
<42-9,CASTLE>So, all three of our confessors

738
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:28,860
<42-9,CASTLE>全都有这类问题  酗酒
<42-9,CASTLE>have had problems in their lives -- uh, alcoholism,

739
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,580
<42-9,CASTLE>暴躁易怒  缺乏自信
<42-9,CASTLE>anger management, assertiveness issues --

740
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:33,710
<42-9,CASTLE>而他们都有可能找永恒视野寻求帮助
<42-9,CASTLE>all things that they could've gone through E.H.I. to treat.

741
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:35,540
<42-10,RYAN>但他们都予以否认了
<42-10,RYAN>But they all claim that they didn't.

742
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,310
<42-11,CASTLE>如果他们找过呢
<42-11,CASTLE>But what if they did?

743
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:38,150
<42-11,CASTLE>如果他们找过
<42-11,CASTLE>What if they did,

744
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:41,630
<42-11,CASTLE>但出于某种原因  永恒视野想要消除所有
<42-11,CASTLE>but something made E.H.I. want to eliminate

745
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,280
<42-11,CASTLE>与自身有关联的线索呢
<42-11,CASTLE>any record of their involvement?

746
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:47,510
<42-11,CASTLE>撕掉日记本的相关内容  删除日历记录
<42-11,CASTLE>Torn date-book pages, wiped calendars.

747
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:50,080
<42-11,CASTLE>也许这就是马德森去他们住所的原因
<42-11,CASTLE>Maybe that's why Madsen went to their apartments --

748
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:54,090
<42-11,CASTLE>去消除所有能联系到永恒视野的证据
<42-11,CASTLE>To erase any trace of their connection to E.H.I.

749
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:56,550
<42-12,BECKETT>卡塞尔  仅仅删掉日程记录是不够的
<42-12,BECKETT>Castle, you can't just do that by wiping out calendars.

750
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:58,110
<42-13,CASTLE>-你还得  -消除记忆
<42-13,CASTLE>- You'd have to -- - Wipe memories.

751
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,280
<42-13,CASTLE>想想吧
<42-13,CASTLE>Think about it.

752
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:03,340
<42-13,CASTLE>整整两个星期模糊不清  稀里糊涂
<42-13,CASTLE>The fogginess, the confusion over the last two weeks.

753
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:06,140
<42-14,RYAN>你是说  这个表面光鲜的自助组织
<42-14,RYAN>So y-you're saying that a glorified self-help group

754
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:08,000
<42-14,RYAN>能消除人的记忆吗  怎么消除
<42-14,RYAN>can erase people's memories? How?

755
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:09,340
<42-15,HOLLOWAY>用药物
<42-15,HOLLOWAY>With drugs.

756
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:11,660
<42-15,HOLLOWAY>安妮塔·米勒的检查报告出来了
<42-15,HOLLOWAY>Anita Miller's tests came back.

757
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:15,800
<42-15,HOLLOWAY>她体内普萘洛尔衍生物含量很不正常
<42-15,HOLLOWAY>Found unusual levels of a propranolol derivative in her system,

758
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,080
<42-15,HOLLOWAY>所以我又检查了卡森先生和卡瑟斯先生
<42-15,HOLLOWAY>so I tested Mr. Carson and Mr. Carruthers.

759
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,750
<42-15,HOLLOWAY>他们血液里也有这种成分
<42-15,HOLLOWAY>It was in their blood, as well.

760
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,770
<42-16,BECKETT>普萘洛尔
<42-16,BECKETT>Propranolol?

761
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:24,910
<42-17,HOLLOWAY>少量使用可以用于控制血压
<42-17,HOLLOWAY>In small doses, it's mainly a blood-pressure drug.

762
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:26,940
<42-17,HOLLOWAY>大量使用则能更改记忆
<42-17,HOLLOWAY>In high doses, it's been found to alter memories,

763
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:27,980
<42-17,HOLLOWAY>甚至消除记忆
<42-17,HOLLOWAY>even eliminate them.

764
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:30,380
<42-18,CASTLE>如果它能用于更改记忆  有没有可能让人相信
<42-18,CASTLE>If it can alter memories, could it make someone believe

765
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:32,680
<42-18,CASTLE>他们做过一些实际上并没有做过的事呢
<42-18,CASTLE>they had done something they actually hadn't?

766
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:33,940
<42-19,HOLLOWAY>正常情况下
<42-19,HOLLOWAY>Under normal circumstances,

767
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,720
<42-19,HOLLOWAY>人类的大脑是很容易受影响的
<42-19,HOLLOWAY>the human brain is very suggestible.

768
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,850
<42-19,HOLLOWAY>再加上这种药  我认为完全可能
<42-19,HOLLOWAY>Combined with a drug like this, I'd say it's entirely possible.

769
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:41,600
<42-20,BECKETT>失陪
<42-20,BECKETT>Excuse me.

770
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,220
<42-20,BECKETT>太棒了
<42-20,BECKETT>Outstanding.

771
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,380
<42-21,CASTLE>这简直就是《盗梦空间》
<42-21,CASTLE>This is straight out of "Inception."

772
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:47,590
<42-21,CASTLE>有人把谋杀的记忆
<42-21,CASTLE>Someone planted the memory of the murder

773
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:48,980
<42-21,CASTLE>植入他们三人脑中
<42-21,CASTLE>in all three of their heads,

774
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,850
<42-21,CASTLE>同时让他们忘记自己和永恒视野的关系
<42-21,CASTLE>while erasing any knowledge of their connection to E.H.I.

775
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,670
<42-22,RYAN>卡塞尔  你知道这听起来有多疯狂吗
<42-22,RYAN>Castle, do you have any idea how insane that sounds?

776
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:55,310
<42-23,CASTLE>这是个阴险的计划
<42-23,CASTLE>It's a diabolical plan.

777
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:58,370
<42-23,CASTLE>让三个人在同一桩谋杀案上招供
<42-23,CASTLE>Have three suspects confess to the same crime,

778
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:00,570
<42-23,CASTLE>使警方无法逮捕其中任何一人
<42-23,CASTLE>making it impossible for the police to arrest anyone.

779
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:02,820
<42-24,RYAN>但这仍无法解释他们如何在没去过现场的情况下
<42-24,RYAN>But none of this explains how they all knew the details

780
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,710
<42-24,RYAN>知道谋杀的细节
<42-24,RYAN>of the murder without actually being there.

781
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,520
<42-25,CASTLE>说不定...他们去过了
<42-25,CASTLE>Maybe...they were there,

782
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,910
<42-25,CASTLE>只是...没有亲身去
<42-25,CASTLE>just...not in person.

783
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:12,830
<42-25,CASTLE>会不会是凶手拍摄了谋杀过程
<42-25,CASTLE>What if justin's killer filmed the murder

784
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:14,260
<42-25,CASTLE>然后在药物起效的时候
<42-25,CASTLE>and then showed it to these people

785
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:15,870
<42-25,CASTLE>播放给这些人看
<42-25,CASTLE>while they were in their drug-induced state?

786
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:17,290
<42-25,CASTLE>那他们就会以为这些图像
<42-25,CASTLE>They would think the images were drawn

787
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:18,590
<42-25,CASTLE>是他们亲身经历的
<42-25,CASTLE>from their own experience.

788
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:20,310
<42-26,BECKETT>如果他们看到了真正的谋杀
<42-26,BECKETT>If they were shown the actual murder,

789
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:23,100
<42-26,BECKETT>那他们三人就都是目击者
<42-26,BECKETT>then that makes all three of them witnesses.

790
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,200
<42-27,CASTLE>他们看到了犯罪细节
<42-27,CASTLE>With details of the crime

791
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,730
<42-27,CASTLE>或许能帮我们找到真正的凶手
<42-27,CASTLE>that could lead to our real killer.

792
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:29,460
<43-1,SAM>我告诉你  是我自己按下了扳机
<43-1,SAM>I'm telling you, I pulled the trigger myself.

793
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,160
<43-2,DWIGHT>我也是
<43-2,DWIGHT>So did I.

794
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,960
<43-3,BECKETT>听着  我知道你们都觉得这一切是真实的
<43-3,BECKETT>Look, I understand that it seems real to you,

795
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,220
<43-3,BECKETT>但可能不是真的
<43-3,BECKETT>but it may not be.

796
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,990
<43-4,ANITA>可为什么有人要这么做
<43-4,ANITA>But why would somebody do this to us?

797
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:36,240
<43-5,BECKETT>为了逃脱谋杀指控
<43-5,BECKETT>To get away with murder.

798
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,150
<43-6,CASTLE>你们只需要说出关于那个旅馆房间
<43-6,CASTLE>We just need you to tell us everything you "remember"

799
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:40,830
<43-6,CASTLE>你们所"记得"的一切
<43-6,CASTLE>about being in that hotel room,

800
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:42,820
<43-6,CASTLE>包括不经意听到的声音
<43-6,CASTLE>Down to the last overheard whisper or --

801
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:44,290
<43-6,CASTLE>无意中在镜子里瞥见的身影
<43-6,CASTLE>or glimpse of a shadow in a mirror.

802
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:47,100
<43-7,BECKETT>要记住  你们觉得不值一提的细节
<43-7,BECKETT>Now, keep in mind that what seems like a minor detail to you

803
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,220
<43-7,BECKETT>都可能会成为解决这案子的关键
<43-7,BECKETT>may actually be the key to us solving this case.

804
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,400
<43-7,BECKETT>从安妮塔开始吧
<43-7,BECKETT>So, let's start with Anita.

805
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,620
<43-8,ANITA>我记得的第一件事是敲了147的房门
<43-8,ANITA>The first thing I remember is knocking on the door of 147.

806
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,840
<43-8,ANITA>过了几秒  贾斯汀开门了
<43-8,ANITA>After a few seconds, Justin opened it.

807
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,110
<43-8,ANITA>他笑得很轻佻  然后...
<43-8,ANITA>He smiled flirtatiously, and --

808
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:59,860
<43-9,SAM>等一下  他没有跟我调情
<43-9,SAM>Okay, he did not flirt with me.

809
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:01,830
<43-10,DWIGHT>也没跟我  他很严肃
<43-10,DWIGHT>No, he was businesslike.

810
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:04,640
<43-11,CASTLE>你进去之后看到什么
<43-11,CASTLE>And, uh, what did you see when you went in the room?

811
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,860
<43-12,ANITA>我记得有地毯  是米色的
<43-12,ANITA>I remember the carpet. It was beige.

812
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:09,730
<43-12,ANITA>墙纸上有隐约的花卉图案
<43-12,ANITA>The wallpaper had a subtle floral pattern,

813
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:11,330
<43-12,ANITA>冰箱上有一幅画
<43-12,ANITA>and there was a painting above the fridge.

814
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:12,650
<43-12,ANITA>我想应该是风景画
<43-12,ANITA>I-I think it was a landscape.

815
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,110
<43-13,DWIGHT>对  画的是乡村
<43-13,DWIGHT>Yeah, of a countryside.

816
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,420
<43-14,ANITA>当他从冰箱里拿出一瓶水时
<43-14,ANITA>And when he pulled out the bottle of water from the fridge,

817
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,920
<43-14,ANITA>我记得在冰箱侧门上
<43-14,ANITA>I remember there were six other bottles

818
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,940
<43-14,ANITA>还有六瓶
<43-14,ANITA>in the fridge door there.

819
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:21,000
<43-15,SAM>不对  是五瓶  我记得很清楚
<43-15,SAM>No, there were five. I remember that clear as day.

820
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:21,980
<43-16,ANITA>不对  是六瓶
<43-16,ANITA>Nuh-unh. There were six.

821
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:23,540
<43-17,DWIGHT>我也记得是五瓶
<43-17,DWIGHT>I remember five, too.

822
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:24,970
<43-19,ANITA>-听到了吧  -我知道自己看到了什么
<43-19,ANITA>- See? - I know what I saw.

823
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:26,230
<43-20,SAM>你看错了
<43-20,SAM>You saw wrong.

824
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:28,830
<43-20,SAM>是五瓶  他看见五瓶  我也看见五瓶  你呢
<43-20,SAM>There were five. He saw five. I saw five. You saw what?

825
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,820
<43-21,BECKETT>卡塞尔  如果他们不能在细节上统一
<43-21,BECKETT>Castle, if they can't agree on the details,

826
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,460
<43-21,BECKETT>我觉得我们是得不到什么线索的
<43-21,BECKETT>then I don't think we're gonna learn anything here.

827
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:33,350
<43-22,CASTLE>恰恰相反
<43-22,CASTLE>Au contraire.

828
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:35,720
<43-22,CASTLE>我们刚刚知道了一个非常重要的线索
<43-22,CASTLE>We've already learned something very, very important.

829
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,780
<43-22,CASTLE>跟我来
<43-22,CASTLE>Come with me.

830
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:37,820
<43-23,BECKETT>去哪儿
<43-23,BECKETT>Where we going?

831
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:38,720
<43-24,CASTLE>回旅馆
<43-24,CASTLE>Back to the hotel.

832
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,560
<43-25,SAM>你们显然是在说谎  好吗
<43-25,SAM>You guys are clearly lying, okay?

833
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,460
<43-25,SAM>我...
<43-25,SAM>I --

834
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:45,830
<43-25,SAM>好了  卡塞尔
<43-25,SAM>Come on, Castle.

835
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,740
<44-1,BECKETT>能不能告诉我这是在干什么
<44-1,BECKETT>Could you just tell me what this is all about?

836
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:49,230
<44-2,CASTLE>等我确定自己想对了再告诉你
<44-2,CASTLE>Not until I know I'm right.

837
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:50,820
<44-2,CASTLE>现在我确定...
<44-2,CASTLE>Which...

838
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:53,060
<44-2,CASTLE>我是对的
<44-2,CASTLE>I am.

839
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:55,140
<44-2,CASTLE>你该知道你跟一个天才订婚了
<44-2,CASTLE>You should know you're engaged to a genius.

840
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,130
<44-3,BECKETT>对  擅长惹恼我的天才
<44-3,BECKETT>Yes, a genius at annoying me.

841
00:32:57,130 --> 00:32:58,260
<44-3,BECKETT>现在我是贾斯汀
<44-3,BECKETT>So, I'm Justin,

842
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:00,720
<44-4,CASTLE>而你是其中一个向我开枪的人
<44-4,CASTLE>and you are one of the several people who shot me.

843
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,100
<44-5,BECKETT>真得有开枪的冲动唉
<44-5,BECKETT>I'm starting to feel the urge.

844
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,170
<44-6,CASTLE>我去给你拿水
<44-6,CASTLE>I go to get you a bottle of water, and...

845
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,560
<44-6,CASTLE>告诉我  你看到冰箱里有几瓶水
<44-6,CASTLE>tell me how many bottles do you see in the fridge?

846
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:11,480
<44-7,BECKETT>一瓶也没有  被门挡住了
<44-7,BECKETT>None. The door's blocking it.

847
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,440
<44-7,BECKETT>没错
<44-7,BECKETT>Exactly.

848
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,350
<44-8,CASTLE>这说明安妮塔  萨姆和德怀特
<44-8,CASTLE>Which means Anita, Sam, or Dwight

849
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:15,210
<44-8,CASTLE>也不可能看见
<44-8,CASTLE>couldn't have seen it, either.

850
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:16,400
<44-8,CASTLE>他们所看到的
<44-8,CASTLE>Whatever they saw --

851
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:19,130
<44-9,BECKETT>根本不是在这房间发生的
<44-9,BECKETT>It didn't happen in this room!

852
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:25,490
<45-1,GATES>如果他们没有目击真正的谋杀
<45-1,GATES>Okay, if they didn't witness the actual murder,

853
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:26,920
<45-1,GATES>那他们看到的是什么
<45-1,GATES>then what did they see?

854
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,660
<45-2,CASTLE>在另一个最佳旅伴旅馆的
<45-2,CASTLE>Something that happened at another Best Traveler Hotel

855
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:31,470
<45-2,CASTLE>另一间147号房发生的事
<45-2,CASTLE>i-in another room 147.

856
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:33,530
<45-3,BECKETT>我们查了附近其他分店
<45-3,BECKETT>We checked other branches in the area.

857
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:34,630
<45-3,BECKETT>发现三星期前
<45-3,BECKETT>Now, three weeks ago,

858
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:36,930
<45-3,BECKETT>长岛最佳伴旅酒店
<45-3,BECKETT>the Best Traveler in Long Island city

859
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:41,710
<45-3,BECKETT>把一整层都租给了永恒视野  包括147号房
<45-3,BECKETT>rented an entire floor, including room 147, to E.H.I.

860
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:43,250
<45-4,CASTLE>那房间和
<45-4,CASTLE>Their room 147 is identical

861
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:44,570
<45-4,CASTLE>我们发现被害人的房间一模一样
<45-4,CASTLE>to the one where we found our victim.

862
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:45,640
<45-5,BECKETT>只是冰箱门打开的方向
<45-5,BECKETT>Except that fridge opens

863
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,860
<45-5,BECKETT>和证人描述的相吻合
<45-5,BECKETT>exactly like our witnesses described it.

864
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,430
<45-6,GATES>永恒视野在那里做什么
<45-6,GATES>What was E.H.I. Doing there?

865
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,590
<45-7,CASTLE>他们跟酒店说是为了做会员活动
<45-7,CASTLE>They told the hotel it was some kind of member event.

866
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:53,230
<45-8,BECKETT>但是他们带了自己的保安
<45-8,BECKETT>But they brought their own security,

867
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:55,730
<45-8,BECKETT>并且迫使酒店工作人员离开了几个小时
<45-8,BECKETT>and they kept hotel staff off the floor for hours.

868
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:57,470
<45-9,CASTLE>那天确实发生了点事
<45-9,CASTLE>Something happened that day,

869
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:59,230
<45-9,CASTLE>与贾斯汀的谋杀案有关
<45-9,CASTLE>something connected to Justin's murder,

870
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:01,030
<45-9,CASTLE>他们不想有人记住这件事
<45-9,CASTLE>that E.H.I. wants everyone to forget.

871
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:03,960
<45-10,RYAN>有线索了
<45-10,RYAN>I got something.

872
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:05,730
<46-1,RYAN>我在查看长岛最佳伴旅酒店的
<46-1,RYAN>All right, so I was going through surveillance footage

873
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:07,790
<46-1,RYAN>监控录像
<46-1,RYAN>of the Best Traveler inn in Long Island city.

874
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:09,920
<46-1,RYAN>我想看看那三个自首的人
<46-1,RYAN>I wanted to see if any of our three confessors

875
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,560
<46-1,RYAN>是否参加过永恒视野的活动
<46-1,RYAN>did attend that E.H.I. Event.

876
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,430
<46-2,BECKETT>有吗
<46-2,BECKETT>And...?

877
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:14,400
<46-3,RYAN>没看到他们几个  但是我发现了这个
<46-3,RYAN>No sign of them, but I did see this.

878
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,260
<46-5,CASTLE>那是被害人  看看他和谁在一起
<46-5,CASTLE>That's our victim. And look who he's with.

879
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,910
<46-6,BECKETT>鲍尔博士没有说真话
<46-6,BECKETT>Dr. Bauer lied to us.

880
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:23,130
<46-6,BECKETT>他认识贾斯汀
<46-6,BECKETT>He did know Justin.

881
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:25,350
<46-7,CASTLE>我们现在有足够证据拿到搜查令了吗
<46-7,CASTLE>We got enough for a warrant now?

882
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:30,080
<47-1,RECEPTIONIST>拜托  你们不能拿走这些文件
<47-1,RECEPTIONIST>Please, you can't take those files!

883
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,160
<47-2,ESPOSITO>是吗  搜查令上可不是这么写着的
<47-2,ESPOSITO>Really? That's not what my warrant says.

884
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:33,200
<47-2,ESPOSITO>说吧  鲍尔博士在哪
<47-2,ESPOSITO>Now, where's Dr. Bauer?

885
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,800
<47-3,RECEPTIONIST>我跟你说过  他在斯德哥尔摩
<47-3,RECEPTIONIST>I told you, he's in Stockholm!

886
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,250
<47-4,ESPOSITO>斯德哥尔摩的哪儿  住什么酒店
<47-4,ESPOSITO>Where in Stockholm? What hotel?

887
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:36,900
<47-4,ESPOSITO>我不知道
<47-4,ESPOSITO>I don't know!

888
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,320
<47-5,RECEPTIONIST>他没把联系电话留给我
<47-5,RECEPTIONIST>He didn't leave a contact number!

889
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,860
<47-6,CSU TECH>探长  我追踪到
<47-6,CSU TECH>Detective, I traced the signal

890
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:41,990
<47-6,CSU TECH>上次贝克特探长和鲍尔视频通话的信号
<47-6,CSU TECH>from Bauer's video conference with detective Beckett.

891
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:43,260
<47-7,ESPOSITO>他在斯德哥尔摩的什么位置
<47-7,ESPOSITO>So where in Stockholm is he?

892
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:44,140
<47-8,CSU TECH>是这样的
<47-8,CSU TECH>That's the thing.

893
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:46,030
<47-8,CSU TECH>信号经由斯德哥尔摩
<47-8,CSU TECH>The signal was routed through Stockholm,

894
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:48,450
<47-8,CSU TECH>但好像是由本地的互联网地址发出的
<47-8,CSU TECH>but it looks like it originated from a local I.P. Address.

895
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:50,100
<47-9,ESPOSITO>本地的  在曼哈顿吗
<47-9,ESPOSITO>Local, as in Manhattan?

896
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,890
<47-10,CSU TECH>就在这栋楼里
<47-10,CSU TECH>As in inside this building.

897
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:52,850
<47-11,ESPOSITO>什么位置
<47-11,ESPOSITO>Where?

898
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:58,360
<47-12,RECEPTIONIST>你们不能去那  这是不对外开放的区域
<47-12,RECEPTIONIST>You can't go back there! This -- this area's restricted!

899
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,240
<47-13,CSU TECH>那个房间
<47-13,CSU TECH>That one.

900
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,270
<47-13,CSU TECH>不准动
<47-13,CSU TECH>Don't move!

901
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:07,000
<47-14,ESPOSITO>这就是所谓的斯德哥尔摩
<47-14,ESPOSITO>So this is Stockholm.

902
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:11,230
<48-1,BAUER>好吧  是的  我认识他
<48-1,BAUER>All right. Yes. I knew him.

903
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:14,050
<48-1,BAUER>可对于他的死我一无所知
<48-1,BAUER>But I know nothing about his death.

904
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:16,590
<48-2,CASTLE>那你还在销毁文件
<48-2,CASTLE>And yet you were shredding files,

905
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:19,480
<48-2,CASTLE>那些关于安妮塔  萨姆  德怀特  马德森
<48-2,CASTLE>files on Anita, Sam, Dwight, Madsen --

906
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:21,210
<48-2,CASTLE>所有涉案人员的文件
<48-2,CASTLE>all people connected with this case.

907
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:23,720
<48-3,BECKETT>那天发生了什么事  为什么你和贾斯汀会在那
<48-3,BECKETT>What happened that day? Why were you there with Justin?

908
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,810
<48-4,BAUER>我们只是要拍一部电影
<48-4,BAUER>All we did was make a film.

909
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:26,800
<48-5,BECKETT>电影
<48-5,BECKETT>A film?

910
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:28,500
<48-5,BECKETT>我没有杀他
<48-5,BECKETT>I didn't kill Justin.

911
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:30,740
<48-6,BAUER>我请他来当演员
<48-6,BAUER>I hired him as an actor.

912
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:38,750
<48-7,BAUER>这是我们图像疗法的试点项目
<48-7,BAUER>It was part of our image therapy pilot program.

913
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:40,780
<48-8,JUSTIN>恭候你多时了  进来吧
<48-8,JUSTIN>Been waiting for you. Come on in.

914
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:42,660
<48-8,JUSTIN>给你拿点水喝
<48-8,JUSTIN>Let me get you a water.

915
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:49,170
<48-9,BAUER>电影是为了让观众
<48-9,BAUER>The viewer was supposed to

916
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:51,380
<48-9,BAUER>能将他们的问题发泄到一个人身上
<48-9,BAUER>project their problems on a person --

917
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:52,940
<48-9,BAUER>这个案例中  贾斯汀扮演的就是那个人
<48-9,BAUER>In this case, Justin.

918
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:55,230
<48-10,BECKETT>这就是安妮塔把酗酒的问题怪到他头上的原因
<48-10,BECKETT>That's why Anita blamed him for her drinking,

919
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:58,080
<48-10,BECKETT>也是他成了萨姆易怒情绪聚焦点的原因
<48-10,BECKETT>and -- and why he was the focus of Sam's anger issues.

920
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,600
<48-11,CASTLE>我就知道  你在给他们灌输记忆
<48-11,CASTLE>I knew it. You were implanting memories.

921
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,480
<48-11,CASTLE>不是的
<48-11,CASTLE>No!

922
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:03,510
<48-12,BAUER>不是的  这是为了帮助他们学会控制
<48-12,BAUER>No, it was supposed to help them take control

923
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:06,210
<48-12,BAUER>通过假想把这些问题击毙
<48-12,BAUER>of their problems by literally shooting them dead.

924
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,340
<48-12,BAUER>我们拍了两个版本
<48-12,BAUER>We -- we made two versions,

925
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:10,020
<48-12,BAUER>一个适用于女士  一个适用于男士
<48-12,BAUER>one for women and another for men.

926
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:12,710
<48-12,BAUER>为了激发疗效  我们必须使患者
<48-12,BAUER>For the therapy to work, we had to put subjects

927
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:15,360
<48-12,BAUER>处于药物诱导的催眠暗示状态
<48-12,BAUER>in a chemically induced suggestive state

928
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:19,170
<48-12,BAUER>然后向他们展示这段录像  但是这太真实了
<48-12,BAUER>while showing them this footage, uh, but it was just too real.

929
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,970
<48-12,BAUER>这段经历深深地印在他们脑海里
<48-12,BAUER>They began to internalize the experience.

930
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:23,250
<48-12,BAUER>他们就真的开始相信
<48-12,BAUER>And then they -- they started to believe

931
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:25,020
<48-12,BAUER>是自己杀死了贾斯汀
<48-12,BAUER>they'd actually killed Justin.

932
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,960
<48-12,BAUER>我们立刻叫停了这个项目
<48-12,BAUER>We -- we halted the program immediately.

933
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,680
<48-13,BECKETT>但却已经造成了伤害
<48-13,BECKETT>But the damage was already done.

934
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:30,460
<48-14,BAUER>他们扬言要告我们
<48-14,BAUER>They threatened to sue.

935
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:33,490
<48-14,BAUER>说我们把他们当成了实验的小白鼠
<48-14,BAUER>They said we were using them as guinea pigs.

936
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:35,010
<48-15,CASTLE>你就是这么做的
<48-15,CASTLE>Which you were.

937
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,500
<48-16,BAUER>我们只是想帮他们
<48-16,BAUER>We tried to help them.

938
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:39,500
<48-16,BAUER>我们召回了这些成员做最后的疗程
<48-16,BAUER>We brought them back for one final session

939
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,410
<48-16,BAUER>用来  改正错误
<48-16,BAUER>to...correct the problem.

940
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:42,440
<48-17,BECKETT>你说的改正
<48-17,BECKETT>And by correcting,

941
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,430
<48-17,BECKETT>就是对他们使用药物吗
<48-17,BECKETT>you mean dosing them with propranolol

942
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:47,050
<48-17,BECKETT>这样就能让他们忘掉自己来过你这里
<48-17,BECKETT>so that they would forget they ever visited E.H.I.?

943
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:49,450
<48-18,BAUER>我们只是想帮助人而已
<48-18,BAUER>We were just trying to help people.

944
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:53,040
<48-19,CASTLE>所以你就派马德森杀贾斯汀吗  来帮他
<48-19,CASTLE>Is that why you sent Madsen after Justin -- to "Help" Him?

945
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,650
<48-20,BAUER>马德森只是提醒贾斯汀
<48-20,BAUER>Madsen only talked with Justin

946
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:58,160
<48-20,BAUER>要记得保密协议上的规定
<48-20,BAUER>to remind him of the confidentiality agreement

947
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,630
<48-20,BAUER>防止他跟别人说起这个项目
<48-20,BAUER>that prohibited him from talking about the program.

948
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:02,940
<48-20,BAUER>对他被谋杀这件事  我们确实不知情
<48-20,BAUER>We knew nothing about his murder.

949
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:07,410
<48-21,CASTLE>可死亡现场被布置得和播放的视频一模一样
<48-21,CASTLE>And yet his death was staged to mirror that video exactly.

950
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:08,860
<48-21,CASTLE>我们想要让这一切
<48-21,CASTLE>Why would we do that

951
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:11,860
<48-22,BAUER>不被人发现  为什么要杀人呢
<48-22,BAUER>when we were just trying to make this go away?

952
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,070
<48-22,BAUER>不对
<48-22,BAUER>No, no, no, no, no.

953
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:16,100
<48-22,BAUER>是有人针对我们  某个知道这段录像的人
<48-22,BAUER>Someone's targeting us, someone who knew about that tape

954
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,940
<48-22,BAUER>想利用这视频诋毁我们
<48-22,BAUER>and knew they could use it against us.

955
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:20,340
<48-22,BAUER>可能是某个患者
<48-22,BAUER>Uh, uh, one of the other test subjects,

956
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,720
<48-22,BAUER>某个员工
<48-22,BAUER>someone on the crew.

957
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:24,130
<48-23,BECKETT>我需要
<48-23,BECKETT>I'm gonna need a list

958
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:26,470
<48-23,BECKETT>所有知道这视频的人员名单
<48-23,BECKETT>of all of the people that knew about that video.

959
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:30,220
<49-1,PAM>确定不要再向舞台前走了
<49-1,PAM>Be sure not to step any further downstage,

960
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:33,360
<49-1,PAM>不然幕布放下来的时候会打到你的脑袋
<49-1,PAM>or the backdrop will smack you in the head when it flies in.

961
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,390
<49-2,EDDIE>懂了
<49-2,EDDIE>Roger that.

962
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,830
<49-2,EDDIE>贝克特探长
<49-2,EDDIE>Detective Beckett.

963
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:37,960
<49-3,LAURA>贾斯汀的案子有新进展了吗
<49-3,LAURA>Do you have news about Justin's case?

964
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,080
<49-4,BECKETT>有
<49-4,BECKETT>We do.

965
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:41,440
<49-4,BECKETT>我们认为贾斯汀是由于
<49-4,BECKETT>We now believe that Justin was killed

966
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,590
<49-4,BECKETT>他出演的一个视频而被害
<49-4,BECKETT>because of a video that he acted in.

967
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,460
<49-5,LAURA>视频
<49-5,LAURA>A video?

968
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,550
<49-6,CASTLE>那视频是为一个叫永恒视野的组织拍摄的
<49-6,CASTLE>It was made for an organization called E.H.I.,

969
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:49,980
<49-6,CASTLE>恰巧那视频的后期制作是由可汗后期制作的
<49-6,CASTLE>and it just so happens it was edited by Kahn Post Production.

970
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:51,100
<49-6,CASTLE>可汗后期
<49-6,CASTLE>Kahn Post?

971
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:53,970
<49-7,EDDIE>帕姆  那不是你上班的地方吗
<49-7,EDDIE>Pam, isn't that where your day job is?

972
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:56,960
<49-8,PAM>是  但我不知道视频的事
<49-8,PAM>Yeah, but I don't know about any video.

973
00:37:56,970 --> 00:37:58,070
<49-9,CASTLE>我们认为你知道
<49-9,CASTLE>We think you do.

974
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:59,610
<49-9,CASTLE>当你看到那视频的时候
<49-9,CASTLE>And when you saw the video,

975
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,160
<49-9,CASTLE>你看到了机会
<49-9,CASTLE>you saw an opportunity.

976
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:03,780
<49-10,BECKETT>帕姆  我们查过你的信用卡
<49-10,BECKETT>Pam, we checked your credit card.

977
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:06,630
<49-10,BECKETT>我们知道你刚买了一个翻盖手机
<49-10,BECKETT>We know that you just bought a flip phone.

978
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,510
<49-11,PAM>所以呢
<49-11,PAM>So?

979
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:10,040
<49-12,CASTLE>在贾斯汀被害前
<49-12,CASTLE>So just before Justin died,

980
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:12,920
<49-12,CASTLE>他用翻盖手机给某人发信息
<49-12,CASTLE>he was texting someone on a flip phone,

981
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:14,450
<49-12,CASTLE>据我们推测正是杀害他的凶手
<49-12,CASTLE>presumably his killer.

982
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:15,940
<49-13,BECKETT>当我们查看电话记录时
<49-13,BECKETT>When we looked into the phone records,

983
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:19,150
<49-13,BECKETT>我们查到了宣称是从永恒视野发给贾斯汀的信息
<49-13,BECKETT>there were texts supposedly from E.H.I. to Justin,

984
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:23,480
<49-13,BECKETT>说要付他五千美金再次出演视频中的角色
<49-13,BECKETT>offering him $5,000 to reprise his role in that video.

985
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:26,720
<49-14,CASTLE>我打赌那个电话是你给贾斯汀的
<49-14,CASTLE>I'm betting that you gave Justin that phone,

986
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:28,730
<49-14,CASTLE>或许你跟他说这是永恒视野的人
<49-14,CASTLE>probably told him someone from E.H.I.

987
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:30,160
<49-14,CASTLE>送过来给他的
<49-14,CASTLE>dropped by, wanted him to have it.

988
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,050
<49-15,BECKETT>但发信息的并不是永恒视野的人  而是你
<49-15,BECKETT>But it wasn't E.H.I. that sent those texts. It was you.

989
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:36,380
<49-15,BECKETT>你把他骗去了那个酒店  然后杀了他
<49-15,BECKETT>You lured him to that hotel, and then you killed him.

990
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,120
<49-16,PAM>等一下  这太疯狂了
<49-16,PAM>Wait. This is crazy.

991
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:39,910
<49-16,PAM>贾斯汀是我的朋友
<49-16,PAM>Justin was my friend.

992
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:41,040
<49-16,PAM>我为什么要这么做
<49-16,PAM>Why would I do that?

993
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,600
<49-17,BECKETT>我们查过你的背景  帕姆
<49-17,BECKETT>We checked your background, Pam.

994
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,000
<49-17,BECKETT>在永恒视野蒸汗屋入会仪式中
<49-17,BECKETT>One of the men that was killed

995
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,990
<49-17,BECKETT>被害的其中一人是阿兰·克拉克
<49-17,BECKETT>in that E.H.I. sweat-lodge initiation was Alan Clark...

996
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:49,240
<49-17,BECKETT>也就是你弟弟
<49-17,BECKETT>your brother.

997
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:50,890
<49-18,CASTLE>永恒视野本该对此负全责
<49-18,CASTLE>E.H.I. was to blame,

998
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,670
<49-18,CASTLE>但却没人为此付出代价
<49-18,CASTLE>but no one was held accountable.

999
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:54,800
<49-18,CASTLE>他的死亡被认定是意外
<49-18,CASTLE>His death was ruled accidental.

1000
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:56,030
<49-18,CASTLE>当你看到那视频
<49-18,CASTLE>And when you watched that video,

1001
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:59,290
<49-18,CASTLE>你意识到这是你干掉他们的最好机会
<49-18,CASTLE>you realized you had the perfect chance to take them down.

1002
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:00,620
<49-19,BECKETT>但你知道你需要贾斯汀
<49-19,BECKETT>But you knew that you needed Justin

1003
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:01,450
<49-19,BECKETT>来实施这一计划
<49-19,BECKETT>in order to pull it off,

1004
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:03,570
<49-19,BECKETT>于是你就找到了一个接近他的机会
<49-19,BECKETT>so you found a way to get close to him.

1005
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:06,250
<49-20,EDDIE>天啊  这才是你加入我们戏剧公司的原因
<49-20,EDDIE>Oh, my God. That's why you joined our theater company.

1006
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:07,530
<49-21,LAURA>帕姆  你干了什么
<49-21,LAURA>Pam, what did you do?

1007
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:09,800
<49-21,LAURA>你不明白
<49-21,LAURA>You don't understand.

1008
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:13,070
<49-22,PAM>我必须这么做  为了阿兰  为了其他人
<49-22,PAM>I had to do it -- for Alan, for the others.

1009
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:15,830
<49-22,PAM>必须有人阻止那些恶魔
<49-22,PAM>Those monsters had to be stopped.

1010
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:17,190
<49-23,BECKETT>通过谋杀一个无辜的人吗
<49-23,BECKETT>By killing an innocent man?

1011
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:21,500
<49-24,PAM>贾斯汀才不无辜呢  他是跟他们一伙的
<49-24,PAM>Justin was not innocent. He was one of them.

1012
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:24,540
<49-25,CASTLE>他只是个演员  临时出演一天而已
<49-25,CASTLE>He was just an actor, hired for the day.

1013
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:26,010
<49-26,PAM>那当我试图跟他谈那件事的时候
<49-26,PAM>Then why did he stonewall me

1014
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:28,210
<49-26,PAM>他为什么闭口不谈
<49-26,PAM>when I tried to talk to him about it?!

1015
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:32,560
<49-26,PAM>他们都要为此负责
<49-26,PAM>They are all accountable!

1016
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:35,550
<49-26,PAM>必须有人阻止他们
<49-26,PAM>Somebody had to stop them!

1017
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:40,500
<49-26,PAM>必须有人把他们的真面目昭告世人
<49-26,PAM>Somebody had to show the world what they really are!

1018
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:48,130
<49-27,BECKETT>帕姆  转过身去  你被捕了
<49-27,BECKETT>Pam, turn around. You're under arrest.

1019
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:56,120
<50-1,SAM>所以这一切都是出于报复吗
<50-1,SAM>So all of this was about revenge?

1020
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,610
<50-2,CASTLE>是的  不幸的是
<50-2,CASTLE>Yeah, and, unfortunately,

1021
00:39:57,610 --> 00:39:59,090
<50-2,CASTLE>你们恰巧被卷入其中
<50-2,CASTLE>you just got caught in the middle.

1022
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:00,390
<50-3,DWIGHT>那鲍尔博士呢
<50-3,DWIGHT>What about Dr. Bauer?

1023
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:03,020
<50-4,BECKETT>永恒视野已被取缔
<50-4,BECKETT>E.H.I. has been shut down, effective immediately,

1024
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:06,530
<50-4,BECKETT>而联邦调查局也对他们展开了全面调查
<50-4,BECKETT>and the FBI is launching a full-scale investigation.

1025
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:08,930
<50-5,ANITA>那个开红色货车  给我们下药的人呢
<50-5,ANITA>And the guy in the red van, the one who drugged us?

1026
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:11,250
<50-6,CASTLE>边境巡警在他试图跨境去加拿大的时候把他逮住了
<50-6,CASTLE>Border patrol caught him trying to cross into Canada.

1027
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:12,890
<50-6,CASTLE>他正被遣返回来
<50-6,CASTLE>He's being extradited back here now.

1028
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:13,570
<50-7,DWIGHT>我不明白的是
<50-7,DWIGHT>What I don't understand

1029
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:15,800
<50-7,DWIGHT>我们怎么会都来自首呢
<50-7,DWIGHT>is what made us come in when we did,

1030
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,740
<50-7,DWIGHT>而且还都在同一天
<50-7,DWIGHT>all on the same day.

1031
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:18,970
<50-8,CASTLE>霍洛维医生猜测这可能是某种心理暗示
<50-8,CASTLE>Dr. Holloway figures it was some kind of trigger.

1032
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:20,920
<50-8,CASTLE>也许你们在报纸上看到对此案的某个报道
<50-8,CASTLE>Maybe you read an article on the murder

1033
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:22,250
<50-8,CASTLE>或是在电视上看到了新闻
<50-8,CASTLE>or you saw something on TV.

1034
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:24,490
<50-9,BECKETT>不管是什么  现在都结束了
<50-9,BECKETT>Yeah, but whatever it was, it's over now.

1035
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:26,010
<50-9,BECKETT>你们都自由了
<50-9,BECKETT>You're all free to go.

1036
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:29,960
<50-10,BECKETT>德怀特  你没事吧
<50-10,BECKETT>Dwight, are you okay?

1037
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:31,860
<50-11,DWIGHT>没  没事
<50-11,DWIGHT>Uh, it's -- it's nothing.

1038
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:33,040
<50-12,ANITA>别这样  说说嘛
<50-12,ANITA>No, what?

1039
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:36,750
<50-13,DWIGHT>只是我一直都没机会自首
<50-13,DWIGHT>I just never got to confess.

1040
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:40,700
<50-14,ANITA>如果你说出来会开心点的话  我愿意当听众
<50-14,ANITA>Well, if it makes you feel better, I'll hear it.

1041
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:43,490
<50-15,SAM>我也愿意  走吧  我请客吃披萨
<50-15,SAM>Yeah. Me, too. Come on. I'll buy us all a slice.

1042
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:44,640
<50-15,SAM>好吧
<50-15,SAM>Okay, uh...

1043
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,200
<50-16,DWIGHT>我走到147房间  敲了敲门
<50-16,DWIGHT>So, I-I walk up to room 147, knock on the door...

1044
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,710
<50-17,BECKETT>要是再让我听一遍那个自首的话
<50-17,BECKETT>If I have to hear that confession one more time,

1045
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:51,480
<50-17,BECKETT>我非杀人不可
<50-17,BECKETT>I'm gonna shoot somebody.

1046
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:58,780
<51-1,CASTLE>来  这个东西可以帮你遗忘
<51-1,CASTLE>Here's a little something to help you forget.

1047
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:00,690
<51-2,BECKETT>没事的  卡塞尔
<51-2,BECKETT>It's okay, Castle.

1048
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:02,400
<51-2,BECKETT>你也知道  我就喜欢怪案
<51-2,BECKETT>You know I like the weird ones.

1049
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:10,410
<51-2,BECKETT>有意思的是  人的思想居然可以如此受人控制
<51-2,BECKETT>It's interesting how malleable the human mind is.

1050
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:12,950
<51-2,BECKETT>那些人只不过是想寻求一点帮助而已
<51-2,BECKETT>I mean, all those people wanted was a little help.

1051
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,460
<51-3,CASTLE>结果他们却变成了小白鼠
<51-3,CASTLE>But instead, they became guinea pigs,

1052
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:16,880
<51-3,CASTLE>就因为他们求助时找错了人
<51-3,CASTLE>all because they turned to the wrong person for answers.

1053
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,630
<51-4,BECKETT>是啊  有时候很难分辨
<51-4,BECKETT>Yeah, well, sometimes it's hard to know

1054
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:19,720
<51-4,BECKETT>谁才是对的人
<51-4,BECKETT>who the right person is.

1055
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,880
<51-4,BECKETT>毕竟你也找了三次才找对人
<51-4,BECKETT>After all, it took you three tries.

1056
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:24,320
<51-5,CASTLE>的确  但我最终还是找到了呀
<51-5,CASTLE>True, but I figured it out,

1057
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,260
<51-5,CASTLE>而且还不需要你给我下药
<51-5,CASTLE>and you didn't even have to drug me.

1058
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:28,320
<51-6,BECKETT>你怎么知道你睡着了以后我对你做了什么
<51-6,BECKETT>How do you know what I do to you when you're sleeping?

1059
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:32,640
<51-7,CASTLE>不管你对我做了些什么  下次叫醒我就是了
<51-7,CASTLE>Well, whatever it is, wake me up for it next time.

1060
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:36,540
<51-8,CASTLE>失陪一下
<51-8,CASTLE>Excuse me.

1061
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:41,940
<51-9,CASTLE>阿丽克西斯
<51-9,CASTLE>Alexis.

1062
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,330
<51-9,CASTLE>怎么了
<51-9,CASTLE>What's going on?

1063
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:46,240
<51-10,ALEXIS>爸
<51-10,ALEXIS>Dad

1064
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,270
<51-10,ALEXIS>我能回家吗
<51-10,ALEXIS>can I come home?

1065
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:53,070
<51-11,CASTLE>过来
<51-11,CASTLE>Come here.
