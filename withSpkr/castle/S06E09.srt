3
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:23,250
<1-1,SECURITY GUARD>伙计  我得请你离开这里
<1-1,SECURITY GUARD>Buddy, I'm gonna have to ask you to move along.

9
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:46,200
<1-1,SECURITY GUARD>嘿  你
<1-1,SECURITY GUARD>Hey there!

10
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:49,820
<1-1,SECURITY GUARD>喂喂
<1-1,SECURITY GUARD>Excuse me?

11
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,180
<2-1,SECURITY GUARD>这里是禁区
<2-1,SECURITY GUARD>This is a restricted area.

12
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,060
<2-1,SECURITY GUARD>女士
<2-1,SECURITY GUARD>Ma'am?

13
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:04,020
<2-1,SECURITY GUARD>女士
<2-1,SECURITY GUARD>Ma'am?

14
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,330
<2-2,SECURITY GUARD>你没事吧
<2-2,SECURITY GUARD>Are you all right?

15
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,710
<2-2,SECURITY GUARD>我们该找个安逸的地方
<2-2,SECURITY GUARD>We should go somewhere relaxing, you know,

16
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,320
<3-1,RICHARD CASTLE>可以什么都不做  就那么待着
<3-1,RICHARD CASTLE>where we can just hang, don't you think?

17
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:23,430
<3-2,KATE BECKETT>做蜜月计划之前
<3-2,KATE BECKETT>Before we plan the honeymoon,

18
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,280
<3-2,KATE BECKETT>-是不是该先选日子  -不
<3-2,KATE BECKETT>- shouldn't we set a wedding date first? - No.

19
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:27,570
<3-3,CASTLE>因为警局还没
<3-3,CASTLE>'cause the department hasn't even said

20
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:29,080
<3-3,CASTLE>准你的假
<3-3,CASTLE>if you can have time off yet.

21
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:32,260
<3-3,CASTLE>而且  计划蜜月能帮我们定日子
<3-3,CASTLE>Besides, planning a honeymoon will help us set a date.

22
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:34,480
<3-4,BECKETT>好吧  你说说
<3-4,BECKETT>Okay. I can't wait to hear about this.

23
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:37,130
<3-5,CASTLE>你总不想雨季去泰国
<3-5,CASTLE>What, you don't want to go to Thailand during monsoon season, do you?

24
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,600
<3-5,CASTLE>或者冬天去新西兰
<3-5,CASTLE>Or New Zealand in the winter?

25
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:40,980
<3-5,CASTLE>你先想好要去哪
<3-5,CASTLE>No. You decide where you wanna go,

26
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,940
<3-5,CASTLE>然后想好什么时候去最好
<3-5,CASTLE>the best time to be there.

27
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:44,810
<3-5,CASTLE>这样婚礼日子就定下来了
<3-5,CASTLE>Boom. Lobby for those dates.

28
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,090
<3-6,BECKETT>新西兰
<3-6,BECKETT>New Zealand?

29
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,120
<3-6,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你是想借我们的蜜月
<3-6,BECKETT>Castle, are you using our honeymoon

30
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:50,930
<3-6,BECKETT>去中土游玩吗
<3-6,BECKETT>as an excuse to go and tour middle-earth?

31
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,120
<3-7,CASTLE>你同意我就去
<3-7,CASTLE>I'm game if you are.

32
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:55,840
<3-8,BECKETT>我想要更浪漫而不那么霍比特的蜜月
<3-8,BECKETT>I was hoping for something more romantic and less hobbit-y.

33
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:57,980
<3-9,CASTLE>为什么大家都认为浪漫跟霍比特毫不相干
<3-9,CASTLE>Why does everyone always think those two are mutually exclusive?

34
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,050
<3-10,BECKETT>而且应该是一个我们两个都没去过的地方
<3-10,BECKETT>And it should be a place that neither of us have ever been to.

35
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,180
<3-11,CASTLE>同意  我们找个完美的地方
<3-11,CASTLE>Agreed. A perfect spot that will be ours

36
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,320
<3-11,CASTLE>-独享甜蜜时光  -比如巴塞罗那
<3-11,CASTLE>- and ours alone. - Like Barcelona.

37
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:05,790
<3-13,CASTLE>我带梅瑞狄斯去了那儿
<3-13,CASTLE>That's where I took Meredith.

38
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,260
<3-14,BECKETT>好吧
<3-14,BECKETT>Okay. Um...

39
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,700
<3-14,BECKETT>格拉格斯  我一直想去那儿
<3-14,BECKETT>Galagos, I've always wanted to go there.

40
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,070
<3-15,CASTLE>-金娜  -你逗我呢
<3-15,CASTLE>- Gina. - Seriously?

41
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,000
<3-17,CASTLE>嗯  我们的蜜月是旋风狂扫式的
<3-17,CASTLE>Yeah, part of our whirlwind honeymoon tour.

42
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:16,390
<3-18,BECKETT>好吧  瑞士阿尔卑斯山  听说那里很美
<3-18,BECKETT>Fine. Swiss Alps. I hear they're breathtaking.

43
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,510
<3-19,CASTLE>-是啊  -不会吧
<3-19,CASTLE>- They are. - No.

44
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,670
<3-21,CASTLE>嗯  我跟梅瑞狄斯以前冬天会去那儿
<3-21,CASTLE>Yeah. That's where, uh, Meredith and I used to winter.

45
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,220
<3-22,BECKETT>这样吧  我觉得更明智的做法
<3-22,BECKETT>You know what? I think a better plan

46
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:22,900
<3-22,BECKETT>是你列出来这世界上
<3-22,BECKETT>would be for you to make a list of all the places in the world

47
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:25,250
<3-22,BECKETT>你没去度过蜜月  假期
<3-22,BECKETT>that you've never honeymooned, vacationed,

48
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,080
<3-22,BECKETT>或者迎娶你前妻的地方
<3-22,BECKETT>or married any of your other wives.

49
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:28,680
<3-23,CASTLE>能多难啊
<3-23,CASTLE>How hard could it be?

50
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,090
<4-1,BECKETT>阿尔巴尼亚和芬兰  就这两个地方了吗
<4-1,BECKETT>Albania and Finland-- that's all you've got left.

51
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,070
<4-2,CASTLE>我们常出去旅行嘛
<4-2,CASTLE>Well, we traveled a lot.

52
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,010
<4-2,CASTLE>我肯定还能想到其他的地方
<4-2,CASTLE>Well, I'm sure I can think of some other places.

53
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,680
<4-3,BECKETT>我想去暖和点的地方
<4-3,BECKETT>Yeah, well, my vote's for someplace warmer.

54
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:37,780
<4-4,CASTLE>有道理
<4-4,CASTLE>Ah, maybe you're right.

55
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:41,090
<4-4,CASTLE>或许我们该先选日子
<4-4,CASTLE>Maybe we should just... focus on setting a date.

56
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,090
<4-5,BECKETT>莱恩
<4-5,BECKETT>Hey, Ryan.

57
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,340
<4-5,BECKETT>蕾妮怎么了
<4-5,BECKETT>What's going on with Lanie?

58
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:50,350
<4-6,KEVIN RYAN>这件案子让她有点受触动
<4-6,KEVIN RYAN>Uh, this case just hit a little close to home.

59
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,610
<4-7,CASTLE>怎么了
<4-7,CASTLE>Why? What happened?

60
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:53,450
<4-8,RYAN>夜班保安
<4-8,RYAN>A security guard on the night shift

61
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:56,350
<4-8,RYAN>发现被害人吊死在那根梁上
<4-8,RYAN>found the victim hanging from that beam.

62
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,690
<4-8,RYAN>确认死者是帕姆·霍奇斯  32岁
<4-8,RYAN>We I.D.'d her as Pam Hodges, 32.

63
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,250
<4-9,CASTLE>勒着脖子吊死的吗
<4-9,CASTLE>Hanging, as in, by the neck?

64
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:04,890
<4-10,RYAN>对  但真正诡异的是她的长相
<4-10,RYAN>Yeah. But what's really bizarre is the way the victim looks.

65
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:09,560
<4-11,CASTLE>这是蕾妮的姐姐吗
<4-11,CASTLE>Is that Lanie's sister?

66
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,510
<4-12,BECKETT>蕾妮没有姐妹
<4-12,BECKETT>Lanie doesn't have a sister.

67
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,510
<4-12,BECKETT>-帕姆·霍奇斯和蕾妮有血缘关系吗  -没有
<4-12,BECKETT>- Are Pam Hodges and Lanie related? - Nope.

68
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,910
<4-13,LANIE PARISH>但人说这世上总有个跟我们长得一样的人
<4-13,LANIE PARISH>But they say we all have a twin out there somewhere.

69
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,500
<4-13,LANIE PARISH>看来这就是我的那个了
<4-13,LANIE PARISH>I guess this one's mine.

70
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,170
<4-14,BECKETT>蕾妮  初步尸检结果可以待会儿说
<4-14,BECKETT>Lanie, we can deal with the preliminaries later.

71
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,180
<4-15,LANIE>我一开始是吓了一跳
<4-15,LANIE>I was shook up at first,

72
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:24,230
<4-15,LANIE>但现在没事了  她死于凌晨两点到四点间
<4-15,LANIE>but I'm fine now. She died between 2:00 and 4:00 a.m.

73
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,640
<4-15,LANIE>她的脖子没断  因为凶手对套索动了手脚
<4-15,LANIE>Her neck did not break because the killer rigged the wires

74
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:28,170
<4-15,LANIE>让她的脚刚刚离地
<4-15,LANIE>so her feet were just off the ground.

75
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,070
<4-15,LANIE>她大概是勒死的
<4-15,LANIE>She probably was strangled to death.

76
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,830
<4-16,CASTLE>那么细的绳索怎么没断
<4-16,CASTLE>How does a wire that thin not snap?

77
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,070
<4-17,RYAN>是高强度钓丝
<4-17,RYAN>It's high-test fishing line,

78
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,490
<4-17,RYAN>大多体育用品店都有售
<4-17,RYAN>available at most sporting goods stores.

79
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,410
<4-18,CASTLE>那么  别人看起来
<4-18,CASTLE>So then... it would have seemed

80
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:39,110
<4-18,CASTLE>会以为她只是站在码头上
<4-18,CASTLE>like she was just standing there on the dock.

81
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,500
<4-19,RYAN>我们来的时候她就是那个样
<4-19,RYAN>That's how she looked when we rolled up.

82
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:41,700
<4-19,RYAN>很诡异
<4-19,RYAN>It was freaky.

83
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,800
<4-20,BECKETT>或许这就是凶手的目的
<4-20,BECKETT>It's what her killer was going for.

84
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:46,250
<4-20,BECKETT>让她的尸体组成一幅画面
<4-20,BECKETT>He put her body on display to create a tableau.

85
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:48,680
<4-20,BECKETT>他很有信心  厚颜无耻
<4-20,BECKETT>He's confident... brazen.

86
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:50,230
<4-21,CASTLE>或许这不是第一次了
<4-21,CASTLE>Yeah, like he'd done it before?

87
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,820
<4-22,BECKETT>联系联调局
<4-22,BECKETT>Contact the FBI.

88
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:54,740
<4-22,BECKETT>看看他们数据库里有没有类似的案件
<4-22,BECKETT>See if they have any similar murders in their databases.

89
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,810
<4-22,BECKETT>-有目击者吗  -目前没有
<4-22,BECKETT>- Do we have any witnesses? - No, not so far.

90
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,360
<4-23,RYAN>保安发现被害人之前
<4-23,RYAN>Security guard had rousted a homeless guy

91
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:59,510
<4-23,RYAN>赶走了一个流浪汉
<4-23,RYAN>before he found the victim.

92
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,030
<4-23,RYAN>警员还在找他
<4-23,RYAN>Uniforms are still trying to track him down,

93
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:01,790
<4-23,RYAN>好问问他看到什么没
<4-23,RYAN>see if he saw anything.

94
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,110
<4-24,CASTLE>关于帕姆·霍奇斯都查到了什么
<4-24,CASTLE>What do we know about Pam Hodges?

95
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,330
<4-25,JAVIER ESPOSITO>她来自佛罗里达州  在坦帕市过着边缘生活
<4-25,JAVIER ESPOSITO>She's from Tampa, Florida, where she lived on the fringes,

96
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,770
<4-25,JAVIER ESPOSITO>大概有六次因卖淫被捕
<4-25,JAVIER ESPOSITO>racked up about a half a dozen busts for solicitation.

97
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,630
<4-25,JAVIER ESPOSITO>这是一年以前的她
<4-25,JAVIER ESPOSITO>This is her about a year ago.

98
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,960
<4-25,JAVIER ESPOSITO>看来她境遇有所好转
<4-25,JAVIER ESPOSITO>I'd say she came up in the world.

99
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:12,190
<4-26,CASTLE>她现在可比当时
<4-26,CASTLE>She looks a heck of a lot better now

100
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,450
<4-26,CASTLE>气色好多了
<4-26,CASTLE>than she did back then...

101
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,280
<4-26,CASTLE>就是没气了
<4-26,CASTLE>Aside from the being-dead part.

102
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:16,790
<4-27,BECKETT>-她为什么来纽约  -不知道
<4-27,BECKETT>- Why was she in New York? - Don't know yet.

103
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,530
<4-28,ESPOSITO>她七个月前搬来了这里
<4-28,ESPOSITO>She moved here seven months ago.

104
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,760
<4-28,ESPOSITO>-纽约的驾照  地址在布鲁克林  -好
<4-28,ESPOSITO>- New York driver's license with a Brooklyn address. - All right.

105
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:22,990
<4-29,BECKETT>查查那个地址  看看她是否有亲人在这儿
<4-29,BECKETT>Check her address, see if she's got any family here.

106
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,940
<5-1,CALVIN HODGES>对  帕姆是我侄女
<5-1,CALVIN HODGES>Yes, Pam's my niece.

107
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,660
<5-1,CALVIN HODGES>她在我家待了几周
<5-1,CALVIN HODGES>She stayed at my place for a few weeks

108
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,120
<5-1,CALVIN HODGES>然后搬进了城里
<5-1,CALVIN HODGES>when she moved to the city.

109
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:29,830
<5-2,ESPOSITO>你知道她为什么搬来这里吗  霍奇斯先生
<5-2,ESPOSITO>Do you know why she came to town, Mr. Hodges?

110
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,650
<5-3,CALVIN>她说她需要重新开始
<5-3,CALVIN>Well, she said she needed a fresh start

111
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:35,060
<5-3,CALVIN>-而且她得到了份工作  -什么工作
<5-3,CALVIN>- and she had a job offer. - Doing what?

112
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:37,940
<5-5,CALVIN>我担心帕姆又会去站街
<5-5,CALVIN>I was afraid Pam would start working the streets again.

113
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:40,080
<5-5,CALVIN>她告诉家人再也不会重操旧业时
<5-5,CALVIN>She burned a lot of bridges by telling the family

114
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:42,300
<5-5,CALVIN>也断了很多后路
<5-5,CALVIN>she would go straight and never doing it.

115
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,910
<5-5,CALVIN>但这次不同
<5-5,CALVIN>But this time was different.

116
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:46,400
<5-5,CALVIN>帕姆说要搬就搬出了我家
<5-5,CALVIN>Pam moved out of my house when she said she would.

117
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:47,840
<5-5,CALVIN>她有了一份新工作
<5-5,CALVIN>She started working a job.

118
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,880
<5-5,CALVIN>几个月前  我和她一起吃了午饭
<5-5,CALVIN>A few months back, I met her for lunch.

119
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,730
<5-5,CALVIN>我几乎都认不出她了
<5-5,CALVIN>And I almost didn't recognize her,

120
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:54,100
<5-5,CALVIN>她看上去很好  很幸福
<5-5,CALVIN>she looked so good. Pam was happy.

121
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,410
<5-5,CALVIN>她说这份新工作就是她梦寐以求的
<5-5,CALVIN>She said this new job was just what she needed.

122
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,770
<5-6,RYAN>你对她的工作有了解吗
<5-6,RYAN>What do you know about this job?

123
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:01,110
<5-6,RYAN>-她在哪上班  -她不肯说太多
<5-6,RYAN>- Where did she work? - She wouldn't talk about it much,

124
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,550
<5-7,CALVIN>只说是份正经工作
<5-7,CALVIN>except to say that it was legit

125
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,960
<5-7,CALVIN>她得到了很好的照顾
<5-7,CALVIN>and that she was being taken care of.

126
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:07,350
<5-8,ESPOSITO>她搬走后  你知道她住哪里吗
<5-8,ESPOSITO>Do you know where she moved to after she left your place?

127
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,050
<5-9,CALVIN>那天  我和她打了一辆车
<5-9,CALVIN>Well, she and I shared a cab that day,

128
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,340
<5-9,CALVIN>她在西区高速旁的一幢楼前下了车
<5-9,CALVIN>and it dropped her off at a building off the west side highway.

129
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:16,860
<5-9,CALVIN>但我可以说  帕姆真的有了很大改观
<5-9,CALVIN>I'll tell you this-- Pam took a big step up.

130
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:22,130
<6-1,CASTLE>很大改观
<6-1,CASTLE>A big step up?

131
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,520
<6-1,CASTLE>简直是质的飞跃
<6-1,CASTLE>This is a giant leap.

132
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:28,320
<6-1,CASTLE>这可是最高档的豪宅
<6-1,CASTLE>This is a--this is a vault into the stratosphere.

133
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:31,020
<6-2,BECKETT>一个来自坦帕的前妓女
<6-2,BECKETT>How does a former streetwalker from Tampa

134
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,950
<6-2,BECKETT>怎么负担得起这样的房子
<6-2,BECKETT>afford a place like this?

135
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,610
<6-3,CASTLE>有人来找过她吗
<6-3,CASTLE>She ever get any visitors?

136
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,360
<6-3,CASTLE>-有可能她就在家里接客  -不是的  先生
<6-3,CASTLE>- Possible that she, uh, worked out of the home? - No, sir.

137
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:39,870
<6-4,GRAHAM>这不可能
<6-4,GRAHAM>That is not possible.

138
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,720
<6-5,BECKETT>那这租金是谁付的
<6-5,BECKETT>Well, then who paid for rent?

139
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:45,510
<6-6,GRAHAM>探长  我们在保护客户隐私方面
<6-6,GRAHAM>Detective, we have a well-earned reputation for discretion...

140
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,020
<6-6,GRAHAM>一直有着很好的口碑
<6-6,GRAHAM>and guarding the privacy of our clients.

141
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:50,010
<6-7,BECKETT>有谋杀就没有隐私可言了
<6-7,BECKETT>Privacy ends when murder begins.

142
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:52,510
<6-7,BECKETT>马上告诉我是谁在支付这套房的房租
<6-7,BECKETT>Now I want the name of whoever is paying for this unit.

143
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,540
<6-7,BECKETT>如果你不知道  马上去给我查
<6-7,BECKETT>And if you don't have that, then go get it.

144
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,230
<6-8,CASTLE>我爱死你生气的样子了
<6-8,CASTLE>I love when you get angry.

145
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,980
<6-8,CASTLE>我是说生别人的气  不是对我
<6-8,CASTLE>I mean, at other people, besides me.

146
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:03,440
<6-9,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你看这些大衣
<6-9,BECKETT>Castle, look at these coats.

147
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,220
<6-9,BECKETT>这里起码挂着两万块呢
<6-9,BECKETT>There's at least 20 grand hanging here.

148
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:09,270
<6-10,CASTLE>不论是谁给她的租的房子也给她买了衣服
<6-10,CASTLE>So whoever was paying her rent bought her wardrobe, too.

149
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,140
<6-11,BECKETT>这衣服  这豪宅  她的妓女背景
<6-11,BECKETT>These coats, this insane place, her history as a hooker,

150
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:16,190
<6-11,BECKETT>还有得到了很好照顾的工作
<6-11,BECKETT>and now this job where she's well taken care of?

151
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,850
<6-12,CASTLE>所有的一切都指向一点
<6-12,CASTLE>All points to one thing.

152
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:19,190
<6-13,BECKETT>她是某人的情妇
<6-13,BECKETT>She was someone's mistress.

153
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,670
<6-14,CASTLE>而她的干爹还没露面
<6-14,CASTLE>And her sugar daddy hasn't come forward

154
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,640
<6-14,CASTLE>或是没举报她的失踪
<6-14,CASTLE>or reported her missing.

155
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:22,800
<6-14,CASTLE>他最起码
<6-14,CASTLE>At the very least,

156
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:24,240
<6-14,CASTLE>了解她的生活
<6-14,CASTLE>he knows about her life.

157
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,870
<6-14,CASTLE>最坏的情况  他就是凶手
<6-14,CASTLE>At the very most, he's the one who took it.

158
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,160
<6-15,BECKETT>假如帕姆是被包养的
<6-15,BECKETT>If Pam was a kept woman,

159
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,880
<6-15,BECKETT>那他一定在这里出现过
<6-15,BECKETT>then he's been to this apartment.

160
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:31,820
<6-15,BECKETT>我得叫鉴证组的人来这里收集指纹
<6-15,BECKETT>I'm gonna get ahold of C.S.U., have them sweep for prints

161
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,240
<6-15,BECKETT>这样我们就能知道谁在这里待过
<6-15,BECKETT>so we can find out who's been here.

162
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,960
<6-16,CASTLE>同时  我们也可以看看这里有什么东西
<6-16,CASTLE>While we're at it, we should take a look and see what's on this.

163
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,860
<6-16,CASTLE>这里可能有他们的合影
<6-16,CASTLE>She might have taken a picture of him.

164
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,310
<7-1,TECH AGENT TORI>看起来她没拍合影
<7-1,TECH AGENT TORI>It doesn't look like she did.

165
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,070
<7-1,TECH AGENT TORI>这里大多数都是标准的纽约风景照
<7-1,TECH AGENT TORI>These are mostly standard tourist snapshots of New York.

166
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:45,080
<7-2,CASTLE>没有人物照  朋友  男朋友吗
<7-2,CASTLE>No pictures of people, friends, boyfriends?

167
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:47,220
<7-3,TORI>目前没有发现
<7-3,TORI>I haven't found any so far.

168
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:49,030
<7-4,BECKETT>继续找  好吗
<7-4,BECKETT>Keep looking, okay?

169
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,070
<7-4,BECKETT>同时关注背景中的人像
<7-4,BECKETT>And check the faces in the background,

170
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,500
<7-4,BECKETT>看看是否有人重复出现
<7-4,BECKETT>see if any of them show up again.

171
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:54,070
<7-4,BECKETT>这些照片很可能就是我们的希望
<7-4,BECKETT>Those photos might be our best bet.

172
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,380
<7-5,CASTLE>谢谢
<7-5,CASTLE>Thanks.

173
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,870
<7-5,CASTLE>看来租房人信息没查到喽
<7-5,CASTLE>I take it this means we hit a wall on who rents the apartment?

174
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,740
<8-1,CASTLE>房子是一家叫格莱格斯·贝克的公司租的
<8-1,CASTLE>The lease is held and paid for by Gregs-Baker,

175
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,610
<8-2,BECKETT>是一家注册在伯利兹的壳公司
<8-2,BECKETT>which is a shell corporation based out of Belize,

176
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,360
<8-2,BECKETT>公司的设立方式确保其无法查证
<8-2,BECKETT>and it was set up in such a way as to make it untraceable.

177
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:09,520
<8-3,CASTLE>好吧  那通话记录和信用卡呢
<8-3,CASTLE>All right, well, what about phone records and credit cards?

178
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:11,320
<8-3,CASTLE>这一定能告诉我们帕姆·霍奇斯和谁在一起
<8-3,CASTLE>It must point to who Pam Hodges was spending time with.

179
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,120
<8-4,BECKETT>她很少用电话
<8-4,BECKETT>She barely used her phone.

180
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:15,460
<8-4,BECKETT>她的信用卡账单倒是不少
<8-4,BECKETT>And even though she racked up huge credit card bills,

181
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:18,710
<8-4,BECKETT>不过大多是用在买衣服  鞋子和做头发
<8-4,BECKETT>it was mostly for shoes and clothes and hair salons.

182
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,950
<8-4,BECKETT>也是由格莱格斯·贝克公司按月支付的
<8-4,BECKETT>And it was paid for monthly by Gregs-Baker.

183
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,300
<8-5,CASTLE>鉴证组在她的公寓有发现吗
<8-5,CASTLE>Well, what did C.S.U. Find at her apartment?

184
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,430
<8-6,BECKETT>只有她的指纹  没别人的
<8-6,BECKETT>Her prints. No one else's.

185
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,470
<8-7,CASTLE>-这到底是怎么了  -我也不知道
<8-7,CASTLE>- What the hell is going on here? - I don't know.

186
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:29,570
<8-8,BECKETT>但是有人在掩盖行踪方面
<8-8,BECKETT>But someone is doing an incredible job

187
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,240
<8-8,BECKETT>做得非常到位
<8-8,BECKETT>of covering their tracks.

188
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,600
<8-8,BECKETT>喂  蕾妮
<8-8,BECKETT>Hey, Lanie.

189
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:33,710
<8-8,BECKETT>凯特
<8-8,BECKETT>Kate...

190
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:35,850
<8-9,LANIE>你下来一下吧
<8-9,LANIE>I need you to get down here.

191
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,360
<8-10,BECKETT>好  我们马上来
<8-10,BECKETT>Okay, we're on our way.

192
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:39,900
<8-11,LANIE>不要卡塞尔  就你来
<8-11,LANIE>Not Castle. Just you.

193
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,390
<9-1,BECKETT>怎么了
<9-1,BECKETT>Hey, what's going on?

194
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,610
<9-2,LANIE>帕姆·霍奇斯近期做过整容  脸颊内有植入物
<9-2,LANIE>Pam Hodges recently had a cheek plastic put in.

195
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:52,000
<9-2,LANIE>使得她的脸变宽  就像我一样
<9-2,LANIE>It made her face broader, like mine.

196
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:53,980
<9-4,LANIE>-好吧  -她用的洗发水
<9-4,LANIE>- Okay. - Her hair products,

197
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,870
<9-4,LANIE>口红  指甲油
<9-4,LANIE>her lipstick, her nail polish--

198
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,000
<9-4,LANIE>都跟我用的一模一样
<9-4,LANIE>they're all the same as the ones I use.

199
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:00,290
<9-5,BECKETT>蕾妮  你只不过是碰巧和被害人用的
<9-5,BECKETT>Lanie, you're just picking up on things that are similar

200
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,620
<9-6,LANIE>-一样而已  -我也一直这样安慰自己
<9-6,LANIE>- with the victim. - That's what I kept telling myself.

201
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:04,170
<9-6,LANIE>然后我发现了这个
<9-6,LANIE>Then I found this.

202
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:10,190
<9-7,BECKETT>好吧  这我之前见过
<9-7,BECKETT>Okay, all right. I've seen this before.

203
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,980
<9-7,BECKETT>这是"内在力量"的意思
<9-7,BECKETT>It--it means "Inner strength."

204
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:14,110
<9-8,LANIE>我知道这是什么意思  凯特
<9-8,LANIE>I know what it means, Kate.

205
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,090
<9-8,LANIE>你看
<9-8,LANIE>Look.

206
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:20,600
<9-9,LANIE>我在同样的位置有着一模一样的纹身
<9-9,LANIE>I have the same exact tattoo in the same place.

207
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,300
<9-10,BECKETT>这怎么可能
<9-10,BECKETT>How's that even possible?

208
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:24,530
<9-11,LANIE>我们这么像并非巧合
<9-11,LANIE>It's no accident we could be twins.

209
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:28,280
<9-11,LANIE>是有人故意要把她弄成和我一样
<9-11,LANIE>Somebody went out of their way to make her look like me.

219
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:42,050
<10-1,ESPOSITO>等等  你是说
<10-1,ESPOSITO>Wait a minute. So you're saying

220
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:43,920
<10-1,ESPOSITO>帕姆·霍奇斯想弄成和蕾妮一样
<10-1,ESPOSITO>that Pam Hodges was trying to look like Lanie?

221
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:45,640
<10-2,BECKETT>从纹身和整容手术来看
<10-2,BECKETT>Given the tattoo and the surgery,

222
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,370
<10-2,BECKETT>没有其他解释了
<10-2,BECKETT>I just don't see another explanation.

223
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,090
<10-3,RYAN>但她为什么要这样呢
<10-3,RYAN>Yeah, but why would she do that?

224
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,880
<10-4,CASTLE>因为她干爹喜欢她这样
<10-4,CASTLE>Because her sugar daddy wanted her to.

225
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:53,170
<10-4,CASTLE>有可能他在坦帕找到她
<10-4,CASTLE>Maybe he found her down in tampa,

226
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:56,100
<10-4,CASTLE>把她运过来  按自己的喜好打扮她
<10-4,CASTLE>shipped her up here, set her up in style.

227
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,080
<10-4,CASTLE>对于一个妓女来说
<10-4,CASTLE>I mean, to a streetwalker,

228
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,600
<10-4,CASTLE>这是最轻松的活了
<10-4,CASTLE>that would seem like the greatest gig ever,

229
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:03,110
<10-4,CASTLE>她只要任他把自己塑造成蕾妮的样子就行
<10-4,CASTLE>and all she'd have to do is let him remake her into Lanie.

231
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,190
<10-6,ESPOSITO>-谢了  LT  -不过更加扭曲
<10-6,ESPOSITO>- Thanks, L.T. - Yeah, but even more twisted.

232
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:08,830
<10-6,ESPOSITO>这家伙肯定认识蕾妮
<10-6,ESPOSITO>So this guy has to know Lanie.

233
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,240
<10-7,BECKETT>但她似乎不认识他
<10-7,BECKETT>Only she doesn't seem to know him.

234
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,180
<10-7,BECKETT>不过她还是会录口供的
<10-7,BECKETT>But she's still coming in to give us a statement.

235
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:14,550
<10-7,BECKETT>帕姆大厦的人怎么说
<10-7,BECKETT>Now, what about the staff in Pam's building?

236
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,760
<10-7,BECKETT>有没有提供其他的详细资料
<10-7,BECKETT>Did they give us any more details?

237
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:18,490
<10-8,ESPOSITO>没  没人见过有人去找她
<10-8,ESPOSITO>No, none of them remember seeing any guys coming to see her.

238
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,460
<10-9,BECKETT>也许有其他的方法可以找到这个人
<10-9,BECKETT>You know, there might be another way for us to trace this guy.

239
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,810
<10-9,BECKETT>脸颊植入物上有序列号
<10-9,BECKETT>The cheek implants have serial numbers.

240
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,860
<10-9,BECKETT>也许可以帮我们找到帕姆的整形医生
<10-9,BECKETT>Maybe that'll lead us to Pam's surgeon.

241
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:28,300
<10-10,RYAN>也许干爹藏起来还有别的原因
<10-10,RYAN>There might be another reason her sugar daddy's laying low.

242
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:29,480
<10-10,RYAN>联调局的数据库显示
<10-10,RYAN>FBI database shows

243
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:31,740
<10-10,RYAN>还有两人被用金属钓丝勒死
<10-10,RYAN>two other victims strangled with metal fishing line

244
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,060
<10-10,RYAN>尸体摆成吊死状
<10-10,RYAN>and their bodies staged--

245
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:35,290
<10-10,RYAN>一个在迈阿密  另一个在劳德代尔堡
<10-10,RYAN>one in Miami, one in Fort Lauderdale,

246
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,140
<10-10,RYAN>案子都没破  没有嫌疑人
<10-10,RYAN>both unsolved, no suspects.

247
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:39,260
<10-11,CASTLE>死者来自佛罗里达  也许他在那儿结识了她
<10-11,CASTLE>Well, our victim's from Florida. Maybe he knew her from there.

248
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:41,300
<10-12,BECKETT>调出那两起案子的文件  和我们这个作对比
<10-12,BECKETT>Order the homicide files, check 'em against our case.

249
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:44,790
<10-12,BECKETT>同时  排查帕姆去过的商店和沙龙
<10-12,BECKETT>In the meantime, canvass the stores and the salons Pam went to.

250
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,960
<10-12,BECKETT>也许她和别人透露过
<10-12,BECKETT>Maybe she confided in someone,

251
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:47,760
<10-12,BECKETT>或者有人见过她和他一起
<10-12,BECKETT>or someone might have seen her with this guy.

252
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:52,250
<11-1,CASTLE>一位法医竟然在调查她二重身的凶手
<11-1,CASTLE>An M.E. investigates the murder of her own doppelganger.

253
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,970
<11-1,CASTLE>如果不是发生在蕾妮身上  一定是个好故事
<11-1,CASTLE>It'd be a great story, if Lanie weren't living it.

254
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:58,200
<11-2,BECKETT>我们一定漏掉了什么  卡塞尔
<11-2,BECKETT>There's something that we're missing here, Castle.

255
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,320
<11-2,BECKETT>佛罗里达发生两起相似案件
<11-2,BECKETT>Two similar murders in Florida.

256
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:02,490
<11-2,BECKETT>死者也来自佛罗里达
<11-2,BECKETT>Our victim, also from Florida.

257
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,780
<11-2,BECKETT>还有她跟蕾妮外貌上的相似
<11-2,BECKETT>But then there's this whole Lanie and her look-a-like angle.

258
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:06,730
<11-2,BECKETT>这是怎么回事
<11-2,BECKETT>How does that fit in?

259
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,080
<11-3,CASTLE>完全想不出来
<11-3,CASTLE>I have no idea.

260
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,240
<11-4,RYAN>脸颊植入物有线索
<11-4,RYAN>We got a hit on those cheek implants.

261
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,280
<11-4,RYAN>查到了曼哈顿一位整容医生
<11-4,RYAN>They were traced to a Manhattan cosmetic surgeon--

262
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:14,600
<11-4,RYAN>凯莉·尼曼医生
<11-4,RYAN>a Dr. Kelly Nieman.

263
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:17,550
<11-5,CASTLE>我很想知道凯莉·尼曼医生要怎么说
<11-5,CASTLE>Well, I for one, am very interested in what Dr. Nieman has to say.

264
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:19,620
<11-6,RYAN>还有
<11-6,RYAN>In the meantime,

265
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:21,860
<11-6,RYAN>蕾妮想让埃斯波西托给她录口供
<11-6,RYAN>Lanie wants to give her statement to Esposito.

266
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:26,160
<12-1,ESPOSITO>你不是罪犯  蕾妮
<12-1,ESPOSITO>You're not a perp, Lanie.

267
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,760
<12-1,ESPOSITO>我们不该在这里  以这种方式谈话
<12-1,ESPOSITO>It doesn't seem right-- us talking in here like this.

268
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:31,560
<12-2,LANIE>我想要个私密的地方
<12-2,LANIE>I wanted to be somewhere private.

269
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:35,060
<12-2,LANIE>-赶紧开始吧  好吗  -好
<12-2,LANIE>- So let's get on with this, okay? - Okay.

270
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:38,050
<12-3,ESPOSITO>你能不能想到任何
<12-3,ESPOSITO>Um... so can you think of anyone

271
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,580
<12-3,ESPOSITO>会做这种事的人
<12-3,ESPOSITO>who would do a thing like this?

272
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:40,630
<12-4,LANIE>想不到
<12-4,LANIE>No.

273
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,240
<12-5,ESPOSITO>过去半年内你都和谁在一起过
<12-5,ESPOSITO>Who have you been with in the last six months,

274
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,210
<12-5,ESPOSITO>除了我  我知道我们没有定下来
<12-5,ESPOSITO>besides me? I mean, I know we're not exclusive.

275
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,670
<12-6,LANIE>没有
<12-6,LANIE>No one.

276
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,080
<12-7,ESPOSITO>我要知道真相  无论真相是什么
<12-7,ESPOSITO>I need the truth-- whatever it is.

277
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:54,220
<12-8,LANIE>我说的就是真相
<12-8,LANIE>I'm telling you the truth.

278
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,760
<12-9,ESPOSITO>那他们怎么知道纹身的事
<12-9,ESPOSITO>Then how do they know about the tattoo?

279
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:57,620
<12-9,ESPOSITO>你才纹了三个月  对吧
<12-9,ESPOSITO>You've only had it three months, right?

280
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,330
<12-9,ESPOSITO>如果你没脱衣服别人是看不见的
<12-9,ESPOSITO>No one could see it unless you're naked.

281
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:02,380
<12-10,LANIE>那你有没有不小心和别人讲过
<12-10,LANIE>Well, did you happen to mention it to anyone?

282
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,490
<12-11,ESPOSITO>当然没有了
<12-11,ESPOSITO>Of course not.

283
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,230
<12-12,LANIE>我只给你一个人看过
<12-12,LANIE>You are the only person I ever showed it to.

284
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:07,970
<12-13,ESPOSITO>等一下  还是有地方不对
<12-13,ESPOSITO>Wait. Still, something's not right.

285
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,080
<12-13,ESPOSITO>没道理啊
<12-13,ESPOSITO>This--this doesn't make sense.

286
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:12,100
<12-13,ESPOSITO>快点  蕾妮  好好想想
<12-13,ESPOSITO>Come on, Lanie. Think.

287
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,000
<12-13,ESPOSITO>有人接近过你
<12-13,ESPOSITO>Someone got close to you.

288
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:16,600
<12-13,ESPOSITO>看过那个纹身
<12-13,ESPOSITO>Someone saw that tattoo.

289
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:19,000
<12-13,ESPOSITO>是谁
<12-13,ESPOSITO>Who was it?

290
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,620
<12-14,LANIE>-我的天  -怎么了
<12-14,LANIE>- Oh, my God. - What?

291
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,990
<12-16,LANIE>两个月前有个晚上很奇怪
<12-16,LANIE>I had a weird... night two months back.

292
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,990
<12-17,ESPOSITO>怎么个奇怪法
<12-17,ESPOSITO>Weird how?

293
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,100
<12-18,LANIE>部门有人升职
<12-18,LANIE>Someone at work got promoted,

294
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:34,050
<12-18,LANIE>所以我们一堆人去夜店庆祝
<12-18,LANIE>and a bunch of us hit a nightclub to celebrate.

295
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,200
<12-18,LANIE>大家跳得很欢  所以我待到很晚
<12-18,LANIE>And some hot jazz was going, so I stayed late.

296
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:40,300
<12-18,LANIE>第二天早上醒来的时候
<12-18,LANIE>When I woke up the next day,

297
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:42,830
<12-18,LANIE>我完全不记得我是怎么回家的
<12-18,LANIE>I couldn't remember how I got home.

298
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,540
<12-19,ESPOSITO>等等  你什么时候打破你只喝两杯的规矩了
<12-19,ESPOSITO>Wa-wait, since when do you go busting your 2-drink limit?

299
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:47,920
<12-20,LANIE>我没有  那天晚上也没有
<12-20,LANIE>I don't, and I didn't that night either.

300
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:52,060
<12-20,LANIE>会不会就是那天晚上呢
<12-20,LANIE>What... What if this is when it happened?

301
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:54,090
<12-20,LANIE>他往我酒里下药
<12-20,LANIE>What if he put something in my drink

302
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,960
<12-20,LANIE>把我带回家
<12-20,LANIE>and took me to my place

303
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,070
<12-20,LANIE>然后所有这一切都因我而起
<12-20,LANIE>and all of this started because of me?

304
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,410
<13-1,RYAN>你找我  发现了什么
<13-1,RYAN>I got your message. What'd you find?

305
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,530
<13-2,TORI>帕姆的照片里没有发现
<13-2,TORI>Nothing in Pam's pictures,

306
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,560
<13-2,TORI>但是我扫描了相机里的记忆卡
<13-2,TORI>but I scanned the camera's memory card,

307
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:08,890
<13-2,TORI>恢复了一张删除的照片
<13-2,TORI>and I recovered a deleted picture file.

308
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,920
<13-3,RYAN>这是死者  什么时候拍的
<13-3,RYAN>That's our victim. When was this taken?

309
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:17,360
<13-4,TORI>根据图片详情  是昨天下午
<13-4,TORI>Based on the J.P.E.G. data, yesterday afternoon.

310
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,660
<13-5,RYAN>就是她被害之前几小时
<13-5,RYAN>So just a few hours before she was killed.

311
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,940
<13-5,RYAN>找到那个船坞  并查出船主是谁
<13-5,RYAN>Let's locate that marina and find out who owns that boat.

312
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:26,740
<14-1,BECKETT>纽约警局  我需要
<14-1,BECKETT>N.Y.P.D. I need--

<14-2,BRYCE>I'm sorry... do you have an appointment?

314

<14-3,BECKETT>我们找尼曼医生
<14-3,BECKETT>We're here to see Dr. Nieman.

315
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:34,150
<14-4,BRYCE>-我可以问一下这是怎么回事吗  -不行
<14-4,BRYCE>- Can I ask what this is regarding? - No.

316

<15-2,BECKETT>贝克特探长  卡塞尔先生
<15-2,BECKETT>Detective Beckett. Mr. Castle.

319
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:42,070
<15-2,BECKETT>请进  请坐
<15-2,BECKETT>Uh, please come in. Have a seat.

320
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,440
<15-3,NIEMAN>作为一个孜孜不倦的自我推销者
<15-3,NIEMAN>As a tireless self-promoter,

321
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:47,840
<15-3,NIEMAN>我送你一支笔吧
<15-3,NIEMAN>let me offer you one of my pens.

322
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,160
<15-4,BECKETT>不用了  谢谢
<15-4,BECKETT>No, thank you.

323
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:51,490
<15-4,BECKETT>我们只是想问你几个问题
<15-4,BECKETT>We're just here to ask you a few questions.

324
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:55,860
<15-5,NIEMAN>我想说  你的脸真是太美了  探长
<15-5,NIEMAN>Oh, can I just say, you have an amazing face, detective?

325
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,660
<15-5,NIEMAN>那...
<15-5,NIEMAN>And what about, uh...

326
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:59,030
<15-6,CASTLE>那我的呢
<15-6,CASTLE>What about my face?

327
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,460
<15-7,NIEMAN>很有潜质
<15-7,NIEMAN>Uh... amazing potential.

328
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:04,420
<15-8,BECKETT>不如讨论一下帕姆·霍奇斯的脸吧
<15-8,BECKETT>Why don't we talk about Pam Hodges' face

329
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:06,440
<15-8,BECKETT>和她被害的事
<15-8,BECKETT>and the fact that she was murdered?

330
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:08,910
<15-9,NIEMAN>天啊  怎么回事
<15-9,NIEMAN>Jeez. What happened?

331
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,200
<15-10,BECKETT>她是你的顾客  对吧
<15-10,BECKETT>She was one of your patients. Is that correct?

332
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:14,520
<15-11,NIEMAN>是的  我给她做了一下修整
<15-11,NIEMAN>Uh, yes. Yes, I performed some refinements.

333
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:15,940
<15-12,CASTLE>在谁的授意下呢
<15-12,CASTLE>And at whose behest?

334
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:17,190
<15-13,NIEMAN>她自己
<15-13,NIEMAN>Hers.

335
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:19,790
<15-13,NIEMAN>她给我带来了一张她朋友的照片
<15-13,NIEMAN>She actually brought me a picture of a friend of hers.

336
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,580
<15-13,NIEMAN>她们脸型相似
<15-13,NIEMAN>They had similar facial structure,

337
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:23,830
<15-13,NIEMAN>帕姆想接近她朋友的长相
<15-13,NIEMAN>and Pam wanted to look a bit more like her friend.

338
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,460
<15-14,BECKETT>等等  我问你  顾客来这里
<15-14,BECKETT>Wait. Let me get this straight. So people come in

339
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:27,490
<15-14,BECKETT>要求整容成别人的模样
<15-14,BECKETT>and ask to look like other people,

340
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,310
<15-14,BECKETT>你们就照做
<15-14,BECKETT>and you just do it?

341
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,060
<15-15,NIEMAN>病人带照片过来也不足为奇
<15-15,NIEMAN>Well, it's not unusual for patients to bring me photos--

342
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:34,790
<15-15,NIEMAN>通常是模特或演员的照片  用作参考
<15-15,NIEMAN>Usually of models or actors-- for reference.

343
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,130
<15-16,CASTLE>她给你看的这些照片
<15-16,CASTLE>And these photos she showed you,

344
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,550
<15-16,CASTLE>是在哪拍的
<15-16,CASTLE>where were they taken?

345
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,080
<15-17,NIEMAN>像是酒吧或俱乐部的快照
<15-17,NIEMAN>They looked like snapshots from a bar or a club,

346
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:41,230
<15-17,NIEMAN>我记得是这样
<15-17,NIEMAN>as I recall.

347
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,020
<15-18,BECKETT>她和别人一起来过吗
<15-18,BECKETT>Did she ever come here with anyone, um...

348
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:47,070
<15-18,BECKETT>她提到过她生活中的人吗
<15-18,BECKETT>Did she ever mention any of the men in her life?

349
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,560
<15-19,NIEMAN>恐怕没有
<15-19,NIEMAN>No, I'm afraid not.

350
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:51,670
<15-20,CASTLE>是谁付了她整容的费用
<15-20,CASTLE>And who was it that paid for these new cheeks of hers?

351
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,540
<15-21,NIEMAN>是她付的  公司支票
<15-21,NIEMAN>She did... with a company check.

352
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:55,060
<15-22,CASTLE>格莱格斯·贝克吗
<15-22,CASTLE>From Gregs-Baker?

353
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:58,190
<15-23,NIEMAN>我得再查一下  不过听起来没错
<15-23,NIEMAN>I'd have to look, but that-- that sounds right.

354
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,860
<15-24,BECKETT>失陪一下
<15-24,BECKETT>Um, excuse me.

<15-26,NIEMAN>我很乐意帮你挖掘潜力
<15-26,NIEMAN>And I'd love to help you realize it.

<16-2,RYAN>-说吧  -我们查到了照片上的船坞
<16-2,RYAN>- Yeah, hey. - We tracked down that marina from the photo.

360
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,860
<16-2,RYAN>是长岛的迎风湾
<16-2,RYAN>It's Windward Cove in Long Island.

361
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,410
<16-3,BECKETT>-我们正在这儿  -帕姆登的是谁的船
<16-3,BECKETT>- We're here right now. - Who's boat was Pam on?

362
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,910
<16-4,RYAN>船登记在佛罗里达的鲁迪·霍林斯名下
<16-4,RYAN>It's registered out of Florida to a Rudy Hollings.

363
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,210
<16-5,BECKETT>好  他是什么情况
<16-5,BECKETT>Okay, so what do we know about him?

364
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,220
<16-6,RYAN>一无所知  只知道帕姆遇害当晚
<16-6,RYAN>Not a damn thing, except for Pam was on his boat

365
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,320
<16-6,RYAN>在他的船上
<16-6,RYAN>the night she was murdered.

366
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:27,320
<16-6,RYAN>-我们要登船了  安全了再给你打电话  -好
<16-6,RYAN>- We're about to board. I'll call you when it's secure. - Okay.

367
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,500
<16-6,RYAN>纽约警局  纽约警局
<16-6,RYAN>N.Y.P.D.! N.Y.P.D.!

368
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,060
<17-1,SWAT TEAM MEMBER>警察  前方有个疑犯
<17-1,SWAT TEAM MEMBER>Police! Got a suspect up ahead!

<17-4,ESPOSITO>怎么了
<17-4,ESPOSITO>What?

374
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,860
<17-5,RYAN>-埃斯波西托  出去  别看  -什么意思
<17-5,RYAN>- Espo, go outside. Don't look, man. - What do you mean?

375
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:10,220
<17-6,ESPOSITO>你说什么  叫我出去
<17-6,ESPOSITO>What are you talking about, go outside? Huh?

376
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:11,500
<17-1,SWAT TEAM MEMBER>让我看
<17-1,SWAT TEAM MEMBER>Let me see.

377
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,330
<17-7,ESPOSITO>是我
<17-7,ESPOSITO>It's me.

378
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,700
<18-1,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>死者是丹尼尔·桑托斯
<18-1,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>Our victim is Daniel Santos

379
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:32,040
<18-1,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>和帕姆·霍奇斯一样  他被钓丝吊着
<18-1,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>like Pam Hodges, he was hung with fishing line.

380
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:35,120
<18-1,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>不过桑托斯没有做过整容手术的迹象
<18-1,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>Although Santos shows no sign of cosmetic surgery,

381
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:37,960
<18-1,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>凶手  由于不明原因
<18-1,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>this killer-- for reasons unknown--

382
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:40,760
<18-1,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>显然精心挑选了两名
<18-1,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>has clearly selected two victims

383
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:44,270
<18-1,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>样貌和我们两名警员相似的人下手
<18-1,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>who bear a deliberate resemblance to members of our own police family.

384
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,640
<18-1,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>犯罪现场有什么线索
<18-1,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>Now, what did the crime scene give us?

385
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:48,520
<18-2,ESPOSITO>没有指纹和痕量证据
<18-2,ESPOSITO>Well, there's no prints or trace evidence.

386
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,630
<18-2,ESPOSITO>我们只知道吊着桑托斯的装备
<18-2,ESPOSITO>All we know is that the rig Santos was hung from

387
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,960
<18-2,ESPOSITO>是用标准五金店管子搭建
<18-2,ESPOSITO>was built from standard hardware store pipe,

388
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:54,600
<18-2,ESPOSITO>装钓丝的卷线器
<18-2,ESPOSITO>and that the fishing reel that fed the line

389
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:57,510
<18-2,ESPOSITO>是2005年在北卡罗来纳州一家鱼饵店买的
<18-2,ESPOSITO>was bought from a bait shop in North Carolina in 2005.

390
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,950
<18-3,GATES>船主的资料呢
<18-3,GATES>Where are we on the owner of the boat?

391
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,530
<18-4,RYAN>鲁迪·霍林斯  他在西班牙待了一年
<18-4,RYAN>Rudy Hollings--he's been in Spain for a year.

392
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:04,440
<18-4,RYAN>他说不知道谁会利用他的船杀人
<18-4,RYAN>He said he had no idea who would've used his boat to commit a murder.

393
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:06,860
<18-5,GATES>那就是有人知道他的出行计划
<18-5,GATES>So somebody could have been aware of his travel plans?

394
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:09,900
<18-6,CASTLE>也有可能是凶手对船只有所了解
<18-6,CASTLE>It's also possible if the killer knew boats,

395
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:12,650
<18-6,CASTLE>他通过观察找到了没有人在使用的船
<18-6,CASTLE>uh, they were looking for telltale signs the boat wasn't in use.

396
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,360
<18-7,BECKETT>对  这可能就是他选这只船的原因  长官
<18-7,BECKETT>Yeah, that's probably why he picked it, sir.

397
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:16,810
<18-7,BECKETT>他知道自己能不受干扰地杀死丹尼尔·桑托斯
<18-7,BECKETT>He knew he could kill Daniel Santos undisturbed.

398
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,490
<18-8,GATES>桑托斯先生的背景呢
<18-8,GATES>Well, what do we know about Mr. Santos?

399
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,930
<18-9,BECKETT>他一年前从乔治亚州搬来这里
<18-9,BECKETT>He moved here from Georgia about a year ago,

400
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:23,000
<18-9,BECKETT>我还在找他目前的住址
<18-9,BECKETT>uh, I'm still trying to find a current address.

401
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:24,230
<18-9,BECKETT>我和他的父母谈过
<18-9,BECKETT>I did speak with his parents.

402
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,440
<18-9,BECKETT>他们告诉我他之前做脱衣舞男
<18-9,BECKETT>They told me that he worked as a male stripper.

403
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:28,040
<18-9,BECKETT>三个月前  他打电话给父母
<18-9,BECKETT>Three months ago, he called his parents

404
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:29,570
<18-9,BECKETT>说他不跳脱衣舞了
<18-9,BECKETT>to tell them that he quit stripping,

405
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:31,900
<18-9,BECKETT>找到了一份很好的演出机会
<18-9,BECKETT>and he had landed a big-time gig.

406
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,430
<18-10,GATES>他们知道是什么演出吗
<18-10,GATES>Did they know what this gig was?

407
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,990
<18-11,BECKETT>不知道  他和帕姆·霍奇斯一样闪烁其词
<18-11,BECKETT>No. He was vague, just like Pam Hodges.

408
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,400
<18-12,GATES>好  我要你  埃斯波西托警探
<18-12,GATES>Okay. So I need you, Detective Esposito,

409
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:42,760
<18-12,GATES>和帕里什医生回顾一遍你们共同处理的所有案件
<18-12,GATES>and Dr. Parish to go over all the cases that you worked together.

410
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:46,590
<18-12,GATES>-看有没有哪个有关人员有嫌疑  -是  长官
<18-12,GATES>- See if anyone connected to them presents as a suspect. - Yes, sir.

411
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,120
<18-14,GATES>为了这些死者  和我们自己人
<18-14,GATES>For the sake of these victims-- and our own people--

412
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:52,110
<18-14,GATES>查出凶手
<18-14,GATES>Find this killer.

413
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:58,380
<18-15,CASTLE>我还是不懂
<18-15,CASTLE>I still don't get it.

414
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,570
<18-15,CASTLE>为什么有人会杀害克隆版埃斯波西托和蕾妮
<18-15,CASTLE>Why would someone kill clones of Esposito and Lanie?

415
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,020
<18-15,CASTLE>这算是种警告吗
<18-15,CASTLE>I mean, is it some kind of warning?

416
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:05,760
<18-16,BECKETT>或许我们细查丹尼尔·桑托斯的生活
<18-16,BECKETT>Maybe if we dig deeper into Daniel Santos' life,

417
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:07,000
<18-16,BECKETT>问题就迎刃而解了
<18-16,BECKETT>we'll figure it out.

418
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:09,910
<18-16,BECKETT>我想我知道要怎么查他的动向了
<18-16,BECKETT>I think I've got a lead as to what he was up to.

419
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,260
<18-16,BECKETT>根据他的预付费借记卡记录
<18-16,BECKETT>According to his pre-paid debit card records,

420
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:14,460
<18-16,BECKETT>他每周一  周三  周五下午
<18-16,BECKETT>he bought a latte at the same midtown building

421
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:17,220
<18-16,BECKETT>都在同一幢市中心大楼里买一杯拿铁
<18-16,BECKETT>every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday afternoon.

422
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:19,940
<18-17,CASTLE>-好像他有固定约会  -是的
<18-17,CASTLE>- As if he was keeping some kind of regular appointment? - He did.

423
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:21,190
<18-18,BECKETT>根据门卫的口供
<18-18,BECKETT>According to the doorman,

424
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,600
<18-18,BECKETT>他在见一个叫伊恩·福勒的医生
<18-18,BECKETT>he was meeting with a Dr. Ian Fuller.

425
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:25,040
<18-18,BECKETT>他是个治疗师
<18-18,BECKETT>He's some kind of a therapist.

426
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:27,030
<18-18,BECKETT>事实上  我是个语言治疗师
<18-18,BECKETT>Actually, I'm a speech therapist.

427
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,890
<19-1,BECKETT>我专门研究减少口音
<19-1,BECKETT>I specialize in accent reduction.

428
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,240
<19-1,BECKETT>丹尼尔来自乔治亚州
<19-1,BECKETT>Uh, so Daniel was from Georgia.

429
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:31,800
<19-1,BECKETT>他是不是想改掉
<19-1,BECKETT>Was he trying to get rid

430
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:34,000
<19-2,FULLER>-他的南方口音  -不止如此
<19-2,FULLER>- of his southern accent? - Oh, more than that.

431
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:36,180
<19-2,FULLER>他想改变整个说话方式
<19-2,FULLER>He wanted to change his entire speech pattern.

432
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,240
<19-3,CASTLE>变成什么样
<19-3,CASTLE>To what end?

433
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:40,070
<19-4,FULLER>他没说  可他非常有决心
<19-4,FULLER>He didn't say, but he was very determined

434
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,900
<19-4,FULLER>非常明确他的目标
<19-4,FULLER>and very specific about his goals.

435
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:44,720
<19-4,FULLER>他还带来了一断想达成的目标的音频文件
<19-4,FULLER>He even brought in an audio file of how he wanted to sound.

436
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,130
<19-6,FULLER>-你有那份文件吗  -有  我带来了
<19-6,FULLER>- Do you have the file? - Yeah, I have it right here.

437
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,760
<19-6,FULLER>我这就把它调出来
<19-6,FULLER>Let me just, uh, pull it up.

438
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,150
<19-7,ESPOSITO>没错
<19-7,ESPOSITO>It's true.

439
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,340
<19-7,ESPOSITO>比如  我以前是军人
<19-7,ESPOSITO>For example, I'm former military,

440
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:57,320
<19-7,ESPOSITO>所以我是个神枪手
<19-7,ESPOSITO>Which makes me an expert marksman.

441
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:58,750
<19-7,ESPOSITO>我通常是第一个破门而入的
<19-7,ESPOSITO>I'm usually first through the door.

442
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,750
<19-8,BECKETT>这是埃斯波西托
<19-8,BECKETT>That's Esposito.

443
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,050
<19-9,ESPOSITO>我则是身强体壮的那位
<19-9,ESPOSITO>I'm definitely the physical one.

444
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:01,960
<19-10,CASTLE>是从那部在分局拍摄的
<19-10,CASTLE>That's from the documentary

445
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:03,170
<19-10,CASTLE>-纪录片里截取的  -我身体一直很棒
<19-10,CASTLE>- we shot right here at the precinct. - I stay in sick shape.

446
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:03,980
<19-10,CASTLE>瞧瞧
<19-10,CASTLE>Boom!

447
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:05,230
<19-10,CASTLE>桑托斯不仅长得像他
<19-10,CASTLE>Santos wasn't just a look-alike--

448
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,520
<19-10,CASTLE>-说话也像  -说真的
<19-10,CASTLE>- He was a sound-alike. - Seriously though...

449
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:12,130
<20-1,ESPOSITO>他的脸  他的发型
<20-1,ESPOSITO>His face, the way he cut his hair,

450
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,890
<20-1,ESPOSITO>现在他连说话都跟我一样了吗
<20-1,ESPOSITO>and now he's trying to talk like me, too?

451
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,900
<20-1,ESPOSITO>什么样的神经病会这么做
<20-1,ESPOSITO>What kind of sicko is doing this?

452
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:17,720
<20-2,LANIE>我浏览了我们经手的每一件案子
<20-2,LANIE>I went through every case we worked on,

453
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,440
<20-2,LANIE>一无所获
<20-2,LANIE>and nothing jumped out.

454
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:20,700
<20-3,ESPOSITO>我也一样
<20-3,ESPOSITO>Yeah, not for me either.

455
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:21,910
<20-3,ESPOSITO>这肯定
<20-3,ESPOSITO>It's gotta be--

456
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,750
<20-3,ESPOSITO>这肯定是私人恩怨
<20-3,ESPOSITO>It's gotta be something personal.

457
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,100
<20-3,ESPOSITO>这肯定是知道我们关系的人做的
<20-3,ESPOSITO>It's gotta be someone who knows about our relationship.

458
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:28,510
<20-3,ESPOSITO>不管他是谁  肯定是个变态
<20-3,ESPOSITO>Well, whoever he is, he's a freak.

459
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,560
<20-4,LANIE>他让丹尼尔·桑托斯饱受折磨
<20-4,LANIE>He made Daniel Santos suffer.

460
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:32,610
<20-4,LANIE>看看皮肤下的出血情况
<20-4,LANIE>Look at the bleeding underneath the skin.

461
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:35,600
<20-4,LANIE>他死前那条钓丝嵌入他脖子长达几个小时
<20-4,LANIE>That wire bit into his neck for hours before he died.

462
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:39,360
<20-4,LANIE>凶手利用卷线器  让他慢慢死去
<20-4,LANIE>The killer used that fishing reel to kill him slowly.

463
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:41,550
<20-4,LANIE>他下一个要找上谁呢
<20-4,LANIE>So who is he gonna go after now--

464
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,840
<20-4,LANIE>你和我  另一个版本的莱恩和贝克特吗
<20-4,LANIE>You and me, some version of Ryan and Beckett?

465
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:46,730
<20-4,LANIE>如果这只是个开始呢
<20-4,LANIE>What if this is just the beginning?

466
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,630
<20-5,ESPOSITO>会没事的
<20-5,ESPOSITO>It'll be okay.

467

<20-5,ESPOSITO>我保证
<20-5,ESPOSITO>I promise.

<20-5,ESPOSITO>我不会让任何人伤害你
<20-5,ESPOSITO>I won't let anything happen to you.

469
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:56,440
<20-5,ESPOSITO>是吗
<20-5,ESPOSITO>Yeah?

470
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:59,160
<20-6,LANIE>那你自己呢
<20-6,LANIE>What if something happens to you?

471
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,610
<20-8,ESPOSITO>兄弟  我们正说到动情处呢
<20-8,ESPOSITO>Dude... we're having a moment here.

472
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,920
<20-8,ESPOSITO>抱歉
<20-8,ESPOSITO>Sorry...

473
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,940
<20-9,RYAN>我找到桑托斯工作的脱衣舞俱乐部了
<20-9,RYAN>I found the strip club where Santos worked.

474
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:09,270
<20-9,RYAN>他们有他在皇后区的家庭住址
<20-9,RYAN>They had a home address for him in Queens.

475
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:11,070
<21-1,RYAN>你还好吧
<21-1,RYAN>So how are you doing, man?

476

<21-3,RYAN>It's big-- what you're dealing with.

478
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:16,760
<21-3,RYAN>我只是想说  还有我呢
<21-3,RYAN>I just want to put it out there that I'm here for you.

479
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:18,360
<21-4,ESPOSITO>谢了 兄弟
<21-4,ESPOSITO>Good to know, man.

480
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,480
<21-5,RYAN>我是想说  找人聊聊会有帮助的
<21-5,RYAN>The point is, sometimes talking about it helps.

481
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:23,880
<21-6,ESPOSITO>怎么  你想让我分享内心感受吗
<21-6,ESPOSITO>So what, you want me to share my feelings now?

482
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:25,890
<21-7,RYAN>很多人都会这么做
<21-7,RYAN>Uh, it's what a lot of people would do.

483
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,400
<21-8,ESPOSITO>好吧
<21-8,ESPOSITO>All right, fine.

484
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:29,730
<21-8,ESPOSITO>我要找到这个人渣
<21-8,ESPOSITO>I want to find this piece of garbage,

485
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:32,020
<21-8,ESPOSITO>把他吊起来  看看他爽不爽
<21-8,ESPOSITO>string him up, and see how he likes it.

486
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,160
<21-8,ESPOSITO>就这样
<21-8,ESPOSITO>There...

487
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:35,610
<21-8,ESPOSITO>-我分享了  高兴了吗  -看
<21-8,ESPOSITO>- I shared a feeling. Happy now? - See...

488
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:36,740
<21-9,RYAN>感觉好点了吧
<21-9,RYAN>Don't you feel better?

489
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:39,310
<21-10,ESPOSITO>-莱恩  -算了
<21-10,ESPOSITO>- Ryan... - All right.

490
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,760
<21-11,RYAN>楼管说丹尼尔·桑托斯
<21-11,RYAN>The super said that Daniel Santos

491
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:43,110
<21-11,RYAN>-最近没怎么来过这  -天啊
<21-11,RYAN>- hasn't been around here much lately. - Oh, my god.

492
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:48,100
<21-13,ESPOSITO>-丹尼尔  -不  实际上
<21-13,ESPOSITO>- Daniel? - No. No, actually, uh,

493
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:51,350
<21-13,ESPOSITO>哈维尔·埃斯波西托警探  纽约警察
<21-13,ESPOSITO>Detective Javier Esposito, N.Y.P.D.

494
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:56,240
<21-14,THERESA>像见鬼了一样
<21-14,THERESA>It's like seeing a ghost.

495
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,430
<21-14,THERESA>你跟他太像了
<21-14,THERESA>You look so much like him.

496
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,070
<21-15,ESPOSITO>你认识丹尼尔吗
<21-15,ESPOSITO>Yeah, um, so you knew Daniel?

497
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,460
<21-16,THERESA>我希望能更了解他
<21-16,THERESA>Not as much as I wanted to,

498
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:03,460
<21-16,THERESA>但多少知道些
<21-16,THERESA>but a little.

499
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,900
<21-16,THERESA>至少知道他完全可以找更好的谋生手段
<21-16,THERESA>Enough to know that he was better than what he did for a living.

500
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:08,590
<21-17,RYAN>听说他为了一个很好的机会辞掉了那份工作
<21-17,RYAN>We--we heard he quit that job for some big-time gig.

501
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,610
<21-17,RYAN>你知道是什么吗
<21-17,RYAN>You have any idea what it was?

502
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:11,210
<21-18,THERESA>他说他不能跟别人说这个
<21-18,THERESA>He said he couldn't talk about it.

503
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,210
<21-19,RYAN>有人来见过他吗
<21-19,RYAN>Uh, did people come visit him here?

504
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:15,230
<21-20,THERESA>没人来找丹尼尔
<21-20,THERESA>People didn't visit Daniel.

505
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,300
<21-20,THERESA>一般都是倒过来
<21-20,THERESA>It was more like the other way around.

506
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,830
<21-21,ESPOSITO>怎么讲
<21-21,ESPOSITO>Meaning what?

507
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,680
<21-22,THERESA>我看到过他
<21-22,THERESA>I'd see him, uh...

508
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:23,350
<21-22,THERESA>离开这儿  有辆豪华轿车等在前门
<21-22,THERESA>leave here and a limo would be waiting out front.

509
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,680
<21-23,RYAN>-最近如此吗  -没错
<21-23,RYAN>- Was this recently? - Yeah.

510
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,580
<21-24,THERESA>他两晚前被接走的
<21-24,THERESA>One picked him up two nights ago.

511
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:28,970
<21-25,RYAN>他被杀的那个晚上
<21-25,RYAN>The same night he was killed.

512
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:31,190
<21-25,RYAN>你记得那车什么样吗
<21-25,RYAN>Do you remember what that vehicle looked like?

513
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,730
<21-26,THERESA>黑色
<21-26,THERESA>It was black.

514
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,880
<21-26,THERESA>城里随处可见的那种
<21-26,THERESA>I mean, it was just a regular town car.

515
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:39,230
<21-26,THERESA>但牌照周围有蓝色
<21-26,THERESA>But there was... blue around the license plate.

516
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,980
<21-27,ESPOSITO>等等  你是说蓝色霓虹灯吗
<21-27,ESPOSITO>Wait a minute. Do you mean blue neon?

517
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,640
<21-28,THERESA>对  就是那个
<21-28,THERESA>Yeah, that was it.

518
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,770
<21-29,ESPOSITO>蓝色霓虹灯牌照框
<21-29,ESPOSITO>Blue neon license plate frames--

519
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:47,560
<21-29,ESPOSITO>那是蓝月豪轿公司的标志
<21-29,ESPOSITO>That's the trademark of Blue Moon Limos.

520
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:49,260
<22-1,BECKETT>蓝月公司的经理
<22-1,BECKETT>That was the manager at the Blue Moon.

521
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:51,480
<22-1,BECKETT>他说那辆车把丹尼尔·桑托斯送到了
<22-1,BECKETT>He said the limo dropped Daniel Santos off

522
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:53,870
<22-1,BECKETT>订车人的公寓
<22-1,BECKETT>at the apartment of the person who ordered it.

523
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,510
<22-2,CASTLE>不管是谁  可能就是凶手
<22-2,CASTLE>Well, whoever it is, is probably our killer.

524
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,450
<22-2,CASTLE>有姓名吗
<22-2,CASTLE>Did he give you a name?

525
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:59,400
<22-3,BECKETT>凯莉·尼曼医生
<22-3,BECKETT>Yeah, Dr. Kelly Nieman.

526
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:02,860
<22-4,CASTLE>她还真是"很有潜力"啊
<22-4,CASTLE>Well, I would say she has "Amazing potential"...

527
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,580
<22-4,CASTLE>做杀人犯
<22-4,CASTLE>as a murderer.

528
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:18,550
<23-1,GATES>-怎样  -门卫确认
<23-1,GATES>- Well? - The doorman at her building confirms

529
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,320
<23-2,BECKETT>桑托斯两晚前去过
<23-2,BECKETT>that Santos visited two nights ago.

530
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:21,990
<23-3,CASTLE>而且不是第一次了
<23-3,CASTLE>And not for the first time.

531
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,930
<23-3,CASTLE>他说桑托斯经常在医生家过夜
<23-3,CASTLE>He said Santos was a frequent overnight guest of the good doctor.

532
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:27,020
<23-4,BECKETT>两名被害人都与她联系起来了
<23-4,BECKETT>Which directly connects her to both of our victims.

533
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:29,100
<23-5,GATES>凯莉·尼曼能制服得了
<23-5,GATES>So are we to believe that Kelly Nieman

534
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:32,320
<23-5,GATES>正当壮年的桑托斯吗
<23-5,GATES>Overpowered Santos-- a young man in his prime?

535
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:33,930
<23-6,CASTLE>她完全做得到
<23-6,CASTLE>Well, she was more than capable.

536
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,360
<23-6,CASTLE>根据她的简历  她是跆拳道和
<23-6,CASTLE>According to her bio, she's a black belt

537
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:37,160
<23-6,CASTLE>柔道的双重黑带
<23-6,CASTLE>in both tae kwon do and jiujitsu.

538
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,940
<23-7,BECKETT>她还有行船经验且在弗罗里达长大
<23-7,BECKETT>She also has boating experience and grew up in Florida.

539
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:41,970
<23-7,BECKETT>实际上  另两起案件发生时
<23-7,BECKETT>In fact, she was in Miami at a conference

540
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,980
<23-7,BECKETT>她就在迈阿密
<23-7,BECKETT>at the time of the other two murders.

541
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:46,570
<23-8,GATES>我们有任何能证明她有嫌疑的确凿证据吗
<23-8,GATES>Do we have any hard evidence linking her to these murders?

542
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:49,740
<23-9,BECKETT>从一开始就看得出本案凶手十分小心谨慎
<23-9,BECKETT>It's been clear from the beginning that our killer is very careful.

543
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,590
<23-10,GATES>也就是说没证据
<23-10,GATES>So the answer is no.

544
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,860
<23-11,GATES>这整个案子都建立在推测之上
<23-11,GATES>This entire case is circumstantial,

545
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:00,250
<23-11,GATES>所以你得撬开她的嘴
<23-11,GATES>which means you're gonna need to break her.

546
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,090
<23-11,GATES>而且机会只此一次
<23-11,GATES>And you got one shot.

547
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,190
<23-11,GATES>尼曼医生
<23-11,GATES>Dr. Nieman...

548
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,810
<24-1,BECKETT>感谢你能过来
<24-1,BECKETT>Thank you for coming in.

549
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,660
<24-2,NIEMAN>我有的选吗
<24-2,NIEMAN>Was I offered a choice?

550
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:14,570
<24-2,NIEMAN>关于你与丹尼尔·桑托斯的关系
<24-2,NIEMAN>I wanted to ask you a few questions

551
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:17,470
<24-3,BECKETT>我想问你几个问题
<24-3,BECKETT>about your relationship with Daniel Santos.

552
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,220
<24-4,NIEMAN>现在我和他可没关系了
<24-4,NIEMAN>Well, I no longer have one.

553
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:20,870
<24-5,BECKETT>看来你已经知道他被害了
<24-5,BECKETT>So you are aware that he's dead.

554
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,610
<24-6,NIEMAN>我在新闻上看的
<24-6,NIEMAN>I watch the news.

555
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:26,130
<24-7,BECKETT>但你看上去并不很难过
<24-7,BECKETT>You don't seem terribly upset by it.

556
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:29,650
<24-8,NIEMAN>我当然能装得很难过
<24-8,NIEMAN>Well, I suppose I could fake it or lie,

557
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:32,730
<24-8,NIEMAN>但这对你我来说都很无聊
<24-8,NIEMAN>but that's just as tedious for you as it is for me.

558
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:35,100
<24-8,NIEMAN>我们之间纯粹是肉体上的关系
<24-8,NIEMAN>It was purely physical with us.

559
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:40,500
<24-8,NIEMAN>你真的是一个非常美丽的女人
<24-8,NIEMAN>You really are a beautiful woman...

560
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:43,420
<24-8,NIEMAN>但并不完美
<24-8,NIEMAN>but not perfect.

561
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:46,460
<24-8,NIEMAN>我能让你完美
<24-8,NIEMAN>I could fix you.

562
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:50,530
<24-9,BECKETT>他去你的公寓之后你去了那里
<24-9,BECKETT>Where did you go after he came to your apartment?

563
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:53,320
<24-10,NIEMAN>就待在我的公寓里
<24-10,NIEMAN>Hmm. We stayed in.

564
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,790
<24-11,BECKETT>你没有去过哪个船坞附近
<24-11,BECKETT>You didn't go by a marina?

565
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,240
<24-12,NIEMAN>我又没有船
<24-12,NIEMAN>I don't have a boat.

566
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,080
<24-13,BECKETT>但他的遗体就是在一艘船上被发现了
<24-13,BECKETT>And yet his body was found on one.

567
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:00,290
<24-13,BECKETT>在那之前
<24-13,BECKETT>And prior to that,

568
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,920
<24-13,BECKETT>他去过你的公寓
<24-13,BECKETT>he was at your apartment.

569
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:05,030
<24-14,NIEMAN>-没错  但他又走了  -什么时候
<24-14,NIEMAN>- Yes, but then he left my place. - When?

570
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,200
<24-16,NIEMAN>十点左右
<24-16,NIEMAN>Around 10:00.

571
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:08,650
<24-17,BECKETT>丹尼尔·桑托斯和你共度了他最后一天
<24-17,BECKETT>Daniel Santos spent his last day with you.

572
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,840
<24-17,BECKETT>帕姆·霍奇斯是你的客户
<24-17,BECKETT>Pam Hodges was a patient of yours.

573
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:12,530
<24-17,BECKETT>他俩都被谋杀了
<24-17,BECKETT>They were both murdered.

574
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:16,450
<24-17,BECKETT>他们唯一的共同点就是你
<24-17,BECKETT>The only person that they have in common is you.

575
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:17,770
<24-17,BECKETT>你也不指望我会相信
<24-17,BECKETT>Now you don't expect me to believe

576
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,690
<24-17,BECKETT>这纯粹是个巧合吧
<24-17,BECKETT>that that's a coincidence, do you?

577
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,110
<24-18,NIEMAN>当然不是巧合
<24-18,NIEMAN>It's not a coincidence at all.

578
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,030
<24-18,NIEMAN>帕姆就是丹尼尔介绍来的
<24-18,NIEMAN>Daniel referred Pam to me as a patient.

579
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,730
<24-19,BECKETT>这么说他俩认识
<24-19,BECKETT>So they knew each other?

580
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:28,240
<24-19,BECKETT>我们找不到任何证据证明这一点
<24-19,BECKETT>We don't have any evidence of that.

581
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:31,190
<24-20,NIEMAN>我确定如果你继续查下去肯定会有所收获
<24-20,NIEMAN>Well, I'm sure you'll find some if you keep looking.

582
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,470
<24-20,NIEMAN>帕姆来见我时  说过是他推荐她来的
<24-20,NIEMAN>When Pam came in, she said that he'd recommended her to me.

583
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:36,520
<24-20,NIEMAN>我也问你个问题
<24-20,NIEMAN>Let me ask you something.

584
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:38,930
<24-20,NIEMAN>你想没想到过我被陷害了
<24-20,NIEMAN>Has it occurred to you that I'm being set up here?

585
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,410
<24-21,BECKETT>谁陷害的你
<24-21,BECKETT>Set up by whom?

586
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,990
<24-22,NIEMAN>也许这个凶手
<24-22,NIEMAN>Maybe whoever did this

587
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,420
<24-22,NIEMAN>知道我与丹尼尔和帕姆的关系
<24-22,NIEMAN>knew of my connection to Daniel and Pam.

588
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:46,150
<24-22,NIEMAN>也许这就是他计划的一部分
<24-22,NIEMAN>Maybe this was part of their plan--

589
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,280
<24-22,NIEMAN>浪费你我的时间
<24-22,NIEMAN>to waste your time and mine.

590
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:49,970
<24-23,BECKETT>我看不会
<24-23,BECKETT>I doubt that.

591
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,890
<24-24,NIEMAN>你没法证明我去过什么码头
<24-24,NIEMAN>You'll never prove that I was at those docks

592
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,860
<24-24,NIEMAN>或者船坞  因为我本来就没有
<24-24,NIEMAN>or some marina, because I wasn't.

593
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:01,720
<24-24,NIEMAN>再说  我又有什么动机杀人呢
<24-24,NIEMAN>Besides... what possible motive would I have for killing anyone?

594
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:06,080
<24-25,NIEMAN>我跟律师约会过
<24-25,NIEMAN>I've dated lawyers.

595
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,610
<24-25,NIEMAN>我知道你要是不起诉我
<24-25,NIEMAN>I know that if you don't charge me,

596
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,450
<24-25,NIEMAN>我有权离开
<24-25,NIEMAN>I can leave.

597
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,480
<24-26,NIEMAN>别生气  探长
<24-26,NIEMAN>No hard feelings, detective.

598
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:18,780
<24-26,NIEMAN>你我都是专业人士  你只是在尽职而已
<24-26,NIEMAN>We're both professionals. You're just doing your job.

599
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:22,750
<24-26,NIEMAN>你寻求正义  我则追求完美
<24-26,NIEMAN>You seek justice, and I seek perfection.

600
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:26,020
<24-26,NIEMAN>话说回来
<24-26,NIEMAN>In fact...

601
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:29,940
<24-26,NIEMAN>你要是打算让自己达到完美
<24-26,NIEMAN>whenever you're ready to take this to the next level...

602
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,150
<24-26,NIEMAN>尽管来找我
<24-26,NIEMAN>you come see me.

603
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,130
<25-1,BECKETT>我什么都没问出来  卡塞尔
<25-1,BECKETT>I got nothing, Castle. I--

604
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:52,130
<25-1,BECKETT>我甚至没法把她和佛罗里达的凶案联系起来
<25-1,BECKETT>I can't even tie her to the Florida murders,

605
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:55,910
<25-1,BECKETT>只知道案发时她在那一带
<25-1,BECKETT>other than the fact that she was in the area when they occurred.

606
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:58,240
<25-2,CASTLE>有些你不爱听的话
<25-2,CASTLE>Can I say something that'll...

607
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:00,420
<25-2,CASTLE>我不知当说不当说
<25-2,CASTLE>probably annoy you?

608
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,740
<25-3,BECKETT>我就是不让你说你不也照样开口
<25-3,BECKETT>Since when do you ask for permission?

609
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:04,000
<25-3,BECKETT>也对
<25-3,BECKETT>Touche.

610
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:06,540
<25-4,CASTLE>如果尼曼医生真的不是凶手呢
<25-4,CASTLE>What if Dr. Nieman isn't our killer?

611
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:08,330
<25-5,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你也看见她在审讯室的表现了
<25-5,BECKETT>Castle, you saw her in there.

612
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,160
<25-5,BECKETT>她在跟我打太极呢
<25-5,BECKETT>She was toying with me.

613
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:11,770
<25-5,BECKETT>她肯定脱不了干系
<25-5,BECKETT>She's involved in this.

614
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,300
<25-5,BECKETT>我能感觉到
<25-5,BECKETT>I can feel it.

615
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:16,190
<25-6,CASTLE>我同意  她不是热情亲切的那种
<25-6,CASTLE>I admit... she's not warm and cuddly.

616
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,440
<25-6,CASTLE>但这并不意味着她有罪
<25-6,CASTLE>But that doesn't make her guilty.

617
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:21,100
<25-7,BECKETT>按说你应该是最不可能相信她的了
<25-7,BECKETT>How can you of all people buy her story?

618
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:24,180
<25-8,CASTLE>因为此时此刻  这比我们的推理更合理
<25-8,CASTLE>Because at this point, it makes more sense than ours does.

619
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:26,740
<25-8,CASTLE>你想一想
<25-8,CASTLE>Just... consider this.

620
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:29,670
<25-8,CASTLE>这整个案子  凶手都抢先我们一步
<25-8,CASTLE>All along, this killer has been one step ahead of us--

621
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:32,010
<25-8,CASTLE>人证物证都没有  公司也是个空壳
<25-8,CASTLE>no evidence, no witnesses, phantom corporations.

622
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:33,840
<25-8,CASTLE>这个人引得我们原地打转
<25-8,CASTLE>He or she has us chasing our tails.

623
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:37,560
<25-8,CASTLE>这同一个凶手  怎么会突然间叫了辆豪车
<25-8,CASTLE>So why, suddenly, does this same person order a limo

624
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:40,880
<25-8,CASTLE>使被害人死亡当天  自己跟他在一起
<25-8,CASTLE>placing her with Santos the night he died?

625
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,110
<25-8,CASTLE>难道是新手疏忽了
<25-8,CASTLE>Rookie mistake.

626
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,320
<25-9,BECKETT>也许这根本不是个疏忽
<25-9,BECKETT>Or maybe it's not a mistake at all.

627
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:47,400
<25-9,BECKETT>也许凯莉·尼曼在下一盘更大的棋
<25-9,BECKETT>Maybe Kelly Nieman is playing a much deeper game.

628
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:48,570
<25-9,BECKETT>也许正是因为她自信
<25-9,BECKETT>Maybe she's so confident

629
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,410
<25-9,BECKETT>没有证据能把她和凶案联系起来
<25-9,BECKETT>that we can't tie her to these murders,

630
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:54,050
<25-9,BECKETT>所以有意留下线索引我们查到她头上
<25-9,BECKETT>that she's letting the trail lead straight back to her.

631
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:56,240
<25-10,RYAN>那个  似乎不太可能
<25-10,RYAN>Um... that's looking pretty unlikely.

632
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:57,230
<25-11,BECKETT>为什么
<25-11,BECKETT>Why?

633
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,470
<25-11,BECKETT>她的不在场证明无懈可击
<25-11,BECKETT>Her alibi's ironclad.

634
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,470
<25-12,RYAN>两起凶案她都没法作案  但是
<25-12,RYAN>She's no good for either of the murders. But...

635
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,580
<25-12,RYAN>我们似乎找到了可能犯案的人
<25-12,RYAN>we might have found somebody who is.

636
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:04,140
<25-13,CASTLE>早跟你说过
<25-13,CASTLE>Told you.

637
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,280
<26-1,TORI>这是凯莉·尼曼公寓外
<26-1,TORI>This is from a traffic cam

638
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:07,830
<26-1,TORI>一街区处的交通探头拍的画面
<26-1,TORI>a block from Kelly Nieman's apartment.

639
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:09,100
<26-2,BECKETT>那是丹尼尔·桑托斯
<26-2,BECKETT>That's Daniel Santos.

640
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:11,680
<26-3,CASTLE>时间显示是10点07分  这么说凯莉没撒谎
<26-3,CASTLE>The timecode is 10:07. So Kelly was telling the truth.

641
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:12,740
<26-3,CASTLE>他确实是在十点前后离开的
<26-3,CASTLE>He did leave around 10:00.

642
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:14,620
<26-4,RYAN>再接着看
<26-4,RYAN>Yeah, now watch this.

643
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,720
<26-5,BECKETT>能拉近镜头看清驾驶员的相貌吗
<26-5,BECKETT>Can we get a closer look at the driver?

644
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:23,100
<26-6,TORI>只拍到这一个角度
<26-6,TORI>No, this is our only angle.

645
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,940
<26-7,CASTLE>不管那人是谁  桑托斯认识他
<26-7,CASTLE>Well, whoever he is, Santos knows him.

646
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:27,410
<26-8,RYAN>我们查了车牌
<26-8,RYAN>Now we tried running the plate...

647
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,890
<26-8,RYAN>结果是从别的车子上偷来的
<26-8,RYAN>But it was stolen off another car.

648
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:29,920
<26-8,RYAN>死路一条
<26-8,RYAN>So no good there.

649
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:32,310
<26-8,RYAN>但托瑞注意到后车窗上有张贴纸
<26-8,RYAN>But Tory noticed a decal in the back window.

650
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,200
<26-9,TORI>是停车证
<26-9,TORI>It's a parking pass.

651
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:36,470
<26-10,BECKETT>迈阿密的"珊瑚之路船坞"
<26-10,BECKETT>For "Coral Way Marina" in Miami.

652
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,660
<26-11,CASTLE>不管他是谁  他可能跟佛罗里达的凶案有关
<26-11,CASTLE>So whoever he is, he could be connected to our Florida murders.

653
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:39,650
<26-12,RYAN>我给船坞打了电话
<26-12,RYAN>I called the marina.

654
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,110
<26-12,RYAN>尽管停车证已经过期
<26-12,RYAN>Even though the parking pass is expired,

655
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,930
<26-12,RYAN>他们还是查出了这是给什么人的
<26-12,RYAN>they were able to tell us who it was issued to--

656
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,480
<26-13,CASTLE>那人叫卡尔·马修斯
<26-13,CASTLE>one Carl Matthews.

657
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:45,860
<26-13,CASTLE>卡尔·马修斯是谁
<26-13,CASTLE>And who is Carl Matthews?

658
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:47,970
<26-14,RYAN>把他的驾照照片调出来
<26-14,RYAN>Show us the DMV photo, please.

659
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,720
<26-15,RYAN>现在认识了吗
<26-15,RYAN>Recognize him now?

660
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,730
<26-16,BECKETT>这是码头的保安
<26-16,BECKETT>That's the security guard from the dock.

661
00:26:58,530 --> 00:26:59,980
<27-1,BECKETT>我们现在认为  是卡尔·马修斯
<27-1,BECKETT>We now believe that Carl Matthews killed

662
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:02,630
<27-1,BECKETT>杀害了丹尼尔·桑托斯和帕姆·霍奇斯
<27-1,BECKETT>both Daniel Santos and Pam Hodges.

663
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,110
<27-2,ESPOSITO>那个发现她尸体的蠢蛋保安吗
<27-2,ESPOSITO>That security mook that found her?

664
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,370
<27-2,ESPOSITO>我们怎么让他逃走的
<27-2,ESPOSITO>How did we let him slip away?

665
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:07,960
<27-3,RYAN>马修斯没有犯罪记录  当时没觉得他有嫌疑
<27-3,RYAN>Matthews didn't have a record, and nothing on him popped.

666
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:10,890
<27-3,RYAN>在马修斯发现帕姆·霍奇斯的尸体一天后
<27-3,RYAN>Now the day after Matthews "found" Pam Hodges dead,

667
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:13,580
<27-3,RYAN>他就辞职了  说他太难过无法工作
<27-3,RYAN>he quit his job, saying he was too upset to work.

668
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,780
<27-3,RYAN>现在他行踪不明
<27-3,RYAN>Now he's in the wind.

669
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:17,150
<27-4,ESPOSITO>我打赌  佛罗里达的案子也是他干的
<27-4,ESPOSITO>I'll bet this scumbag did the Florida murders, too.

670
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,360
<27-5,BECKETT>看来是这样的
<27-5,BECKETT>It looks that way.

671
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:20,250
<27-5,BECKETT>他曾在佛罗里达的渔船出租公司工作
<27-5,BECKETT>He crewed fishing charters in Florida,

672
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:23,500
<27-5,BECKETT>这说明他熟悉船只
<27-5,BECKETT>which means he knows his way around boats.

673
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:26,330
<27-5,BECKETT>2010年  他消失了
<27-5,BECKETT>Now, in 2010, he went off the grid,

674
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:28,820
<27-5,BECKETT>直到一年前  他又出现在纽约
<27-5,BECKETT>and then he resurfaced about a year ago in New York

675
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:30,800
<27-5,BECKETT>在码头工作
<27-5,BECKETT>when he took at job at the docks.

676
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:32,510
<27-6,GATES>下一步打算怎么办
<27-6,GATES>What's your next move?

677
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:36,460
<27-7,BECKETT>我们已经对马修斯和他的车放出通缉令
<27-7,BECKETT>We've got an alert out on Matthews and his car,

678
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:39,960
<27-7,BECKETT>但最可能找到他的办法是联系他的家人
<27-7,BECKETT>but... our best bet is to get in contact with his family,

679
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:42,580
<27-7,BECKETT>朋友  同事  或者前妻
<27-7,BECKETT>his friends, co-workers, ex-wives.

680
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:44,760
<27-7,BECKETT>他认识的人中  肯定有人知道他的下落
<27-7,BECKETT>Someone in his life has to know where he is

681
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:46,970
<27-7,BECKETT>和他接下来想干什么
<27-7,BECKETT>and what his next move might be.

682
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:54,240
<28-1,CASTLE>有进展吗
<28-1,CASTLE>Any news?

683
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:57,030
<28-2,BECKETT>还没有  但我们会找到他的
<28-2,BECKETT>No, not yet, but we'll find him.

684
00:27:58,190 --> 00:27:59,590
<28-2,BECKETT>有什么不对劲吗
<28-2,BECKETT>What's wrong?

685
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:04,410
<28-3,CASTLE>卡尔·马修斯不对劲  他在这个故事里格格不入
<28-3,CASTLE>Carl Matthews is wrong. He doesn't fit the story.

686
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:05,980
<28-4,BECKETT>怎么格格不入了
<28-4,BECKETT>How doesn't he fit?

687
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:08,150
<28-5,CASTLE>在佛罗里达  他就是个整天泡海滩的人
<28-5,CASTLE>In Florida, he's basically a beach bum.

688
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,400
<28-5,CASTLE>在纽约他也只是保安
<28-5,CASTLE>Here he's a security guard.

689
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:11,940
<28-5,CASTLE>这样的人怎么策划得出这样的案子
<28-5,CASTLE>H-how's a guy like that pull this off?

690
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:13,420
<28-6,BECKETT>也许他就是...
<28-6,BECKETT>Maybe he just...

691
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:16,260
<28-6,BECKETT>比他给人的印象聪明得多吧
<28-6,BECKETT>reads more intelligent than he is on paper.

692
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:17,680
<28-7,CASTLE>那钱怎么解释
<28-7,CASTLE>What about the money--

693
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:20,140
<28-7,CASTLE>给帕姆·霍奇斯的手术费
<28-7,CASTLE>enough to put Pam Hodges in for surgery?

694
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:23,320
<28-8,BECKETT>他抢银行或者贩毒了吧
<28-8,BECKETT>He robbed a bank, or he was dealing drugs.

695
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:24,450
<28-8,BECKETT>我也不知道
<28-8,BECKETT>I-I don't know. You know,

696
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:26,870
<28-8,BECKETT>他离开佛罗里达后就没有消息了
<28-8,BECKETT>he fell off the grid after he left Florida.

697
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,930
<28-9,CASTLE>提到这个  他人在佛罗里达
<28-9,CASTLE>Speaking of which, he's in Florida.

698
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:31,750
<28-9,CASTLE>没有消息  从没被逮捕过
<28-9,CASTLE>He's off the grid. He's never been arrested.

699
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,110
<28-9,CASTLE>那他为什么对蕾妮和埃斯波西托那么着迷
<28-9,CASTLE>Why the fixation with Lanie and Esposito?

700
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,040
<28-10,BECKETT>我们没有全部答案  卡塞尔
<28-10,BECKETT>We don't have all of the answers, Castle,

701
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:38,210
<28-10,BECKETT>至少目前没有
<28-10,BECKETT>Not right now, at least.

702
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,470
<28-10,BECKETT>但所有的证据都指向马修斯
<28-10,BECKETT>But all of the evidence is pointing to Matthews.

703
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,420
<28-11,CASTLE>我同意
<28-11,CASTLE>I agree with you.

704
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:43,670
<28-11,CASTLE>我只是觉得他不是单干
<28-11,CASTLE>I just don't think he's working alone.

705
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,590
<28-11,CASTLE>我觉得  他还有个同伙
<28-11,CASTLE>I think he has a partner.

706
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,750
<28-12,BECKETT>比如尼曼医生吗
<28-12,BECKETT>Like who, Dr. Nieman?

707
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,080
<28-12,BECKETT>不对
<28-12,BECKETT>No.

708
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:52,840
<28-13,CASTLE>是我们的老相识了
<28-13,CASTLE>Someone we've dealt with before.

709
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:58,090
<29-1,BECKETT>-3XK  3XK早死了  -是吗
<29-1,BECKETT>- 3XK? 3XK is dead. - Is he?

710
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,300
<29-2,CASTLE>如果我们能在3XK的档案里找到卡尔·马修斯呢
<29-2,CASTLE>And what if we find Carl Matthews' name in his case files?

711
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:02,020
<29-3,BECKETT>杰瑞·泰森从桥上冲下去了
<29-3,BECKETT>Jerry Tyson fell off that bridge.

712
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:04,140
<29-3,BECKETT>从30多米高的桥上跌入水中
<29-3,BECKETT>It was a hundred-foot drop into the water.

713
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:05,290
<29-4,CASTLE>有人找到他的尸体了吗
<29-4,CASTLE>Was his body ever found?

714
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,330
<29-5,BECKETT>没人从那么高的地方摔下去还能活命
<29-5,BECKETT>Nobody could survive that fall.

715
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,650
<29-6,CASTLE>杰瑞·泰森就能
<29-6,CASTLE>Jerry Tyson could.

716
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:10,050
<29-7,BECKETT>卡塞尔  听听你自己说的话
<29-7,BECKETT>Castle, listen to yourself.

717
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:13,040
<29-7,BECKETT>没有任何泰森还活着的证据
<29-7,BECKETT>There's not a shred of evidence that Tyson is alive,

718
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:14,740
<29-7,BECKETT>更别说参与这桩案子了
<29-7,BECKETT>let alone involved in this.

719
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:15,900
<29-8,CASTLE>泰森不会留下证据
<29-8,CASTLE>Tyson doesn't leave evidence,

720
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:17,280
<29-8,CASTLE>除了他希望我们找到
<29-8,CASTLE>not unless he wants us to find it,

721
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:18,720
<29-8,CASTLE>比如已删除的照片
<29-8,CASTLE>like that deleted photo.

722
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:20,700
<29-8,CASTLE>没有证据  加上一丝不苟的算计
<29-8,CASTLE>No evidence, plus meticulous planning--

723
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:24,340
<29-8,CASTLE>就是3XK的特点  这次案子确实符合这些
<29-8,CASTLE>that's vintage 3XK, and this case has it in spades.

724
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:27,030
<29-10,CASTLE>-卡塞尔  -知道3XK还有什么经典手法吗
<29-10,CASTLE>- Castle... - And you want to know some other 3XK classics--

725
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,960
<29-10,CASTLE>利用长相相似的人们
<29-10,CASTLE>using people that look like other people.

726
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:30,780
<29-10,CASTLE>找一个杀手代替自己杀人
<29-10,CASTLE>Using a killer to act on his behalf.

727
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:32,690
<29-10,CASTLE>贝克特  你怎么就看不出来呢
<29-10,CASTLE>Beckett, how can you not see it?

728
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,020
<29-11,BECKETT>我看到的是你的愧疚
<29-11,BECKETT>What I see is the guilt that you feel.

729
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:36,280
<29-12,CASTLE>这事跟我无关
<29-12,CASTLE>This isn't about me.

730
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:38,970
<29-13,BECKETT>听着  泰森逃跑时  他骗倒了我们所有人
<29-13,BECKETT>Look, when Tyson escaped, he outsmarted all of us.

731
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:40,610
<29-13,BECKETT>但你一直觉得那是你的错
<29-13,BECKETT>But you've always blamed yourself.

732
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,330
<29-14,CASTLE>因为就是我的错...
<29-14,CASTLE>Because I'm to blame...

733
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,960
<29-14,CASTLE>是他  是杰瑞·泰森
<29-14,CASTLE>It's him-- it's Jerry Tyson.

734
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:47,230
<29-15,BECKETT>别追着死人不放  卡塞尔
<29-15,BECKETT>Don't chase ghosts, Castle.

735
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,030
<29-15,BECKETT>好吗  不值得  相信我
<29-15,BECKETT>Okay? It's not worth it, trust me.

736
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:50,210
<29-15,BECKETT>探长
<29-15,BECKETT>Detective!

737
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,600
<29-16,FILE CLERK>3XK的档案好像全都不见了
<29-16,FILE CLERK>Looks like the 3XK files are gone.

738
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:54,630
<29-17,BECKETT>什么叫不见了
<29-17,BECKETT>What do you mean, they're gone?

739
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,690
<29-18,CASTLE>全都没了吗  怎么会这样
<29-18,CASTLE>All of them? How?

740
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,770
<29-19,FILE CLERK>肯定是有人领走了
<29-19,FILE CLERK>Somebody must have signed them out.

741
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:02,080
<29-20,BECKETT>是谁
<29-20,BECKETT>Who?

742
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:05,400
<30-1,ESPOSITO>如果能想到别的东西  请务必联系我  谢谢
<30-1,ESPOSITO>Well, let me know if you can think of anything else, all right? Thanks.

743
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:09,020
<30-2,BECKETT>3XK的档案呢
<30-2,BECKETT>Where are the 3XK files?

744
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:09,900
<30-3,ESPOSITO>你们说什么呢
<30-3,ESPOSITO>What are you talking about?

745
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:11,080
<30-3,ESPOSITO>你说什么呢
<30-3,ESPOSITO>What are you talking about?

746
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:12,970
<30-4,BECKETT>你的签名在表单上
<30-4,BECKETT>Your name is on the signature sheet.

747
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:13,700
<30-5,ESPOSITO>不  才没有
<30-5,ESPOSITO>No, it's not.

748
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:15,020
<30-6,CASTLE>有  三天前的签名
<30-6,CASTLE>Yeah, from three days ago.

749
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:16,380
<30-7,BECKETT>你把档案都领走了
<30-7,BECKETT>You checked those files out.

750
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:17,540
<30-8,ESPOSITO>我没领走任何档案
<30-8,ESPOSITO>I didn't check out any files.

751
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:19,590
<30-8,ESPOSITO>一定有人弄错了
<30-8,ESPOSITO>Somebody messed up.

752
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:23,920
<30-8,ESPOSITO>我的天啊
<30-8,ESPOSITO>Oh, my god.

753
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:26,720
<30-8,ESPOSITO>有谁能告诉我们  究竟是怎么回事吗
<30-8,ESPOSITO>Someone want to tell us what the hell is going on?

754
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:37,440
<31-1,BECKETT>电话是法医办公室主任打来的
<31-1,BECKETT>That was the head of the M.E.'s office.

755
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:44,010
<31-1,BECKETT>所有3XK案件死者的报告
<31-1,BECKETT>Reports, lab work, D.N.A., tissue samples

756
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:48,320
<31-1,BECKETT>实验室化验单  DNA和组织样本
<31-1,BECKETT>of every suspected 3XK victim were checked out...

757
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:49,760
<31-1,BECKETT>全被蕾妮取走了
<31-1,BECKETT>by Lanie.

758
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:53,480
<31-2,ESPOSITO>只不过不是真的蕾妮
<31-2,ESPOSITO>Only not the real Lanie.

759
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,630
<31-3,RYAN>你是说那个混蛋回来了
<31-3,RYAN>Are you saying the son of a bitch is back?

760
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,280
<31-4,CASTLE>这解释了死者的外貌相似
<31-4,CASTLE>That explains the look-alikes....

761
00:30:57,290 --> 00:30:59,250
<31-5,ESPOSITO>还有桑托斯模仿我声音的原因
<31-5,ESPOSITO>And why Santos tried to sound like me.

762
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:01,190
<31-6,CASTLE>杰瑞·泰森消失了还不够
<31-6,CASTLE>It's not enough that Jerry Tyson disappeared.

763
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,770
<31-6,CASTLE>他还想让他的案子也消失
<31-6,CASTLE>He wanted his murders to disappear, too.

764
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:04,730
<31-6,CASTLE>不止是证据没了
<31-6,CASTLE>And it's not just evidence.

765
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:07,430
<31-6,CASTLE>他的杀人手法  死者偏好
<31-6,CASTLE>It's his M.O.s, victim preferences,

766
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,470
<31-6,CASTLE>上百条能反映其心理特征的案件细节
<31-6,CASTLE>all the hundreds of tiny case details that can reveal psychology

767
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,610
<31-6,CASTLE>这本可揭露他下落和接下来的行动
<31-6,CASTLE>as to where he is, where he might be going next.

768
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:15,900
<31-6,CASTLE>全没了  好像他一下子洗白了
<31-6,CASTLE>It's all gone.... like he's got a clean slate.

769
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:19,610
<31-7,BECKETT>或许没都洗掉
<31-7,BECKETT>Maybe not completely clean.

770
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:22,600
<31-7,BECKETT>打给关押泰森的监狱
<31-7,BECKETT>Call the prison where Tyson did time.

771
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:25,130
<31-7,BECKETT>在他的记录也消失前  让他们保管好
<31-7,BECKETT>Have them secure his records before they disappear, too,

772
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:27,020
<31-7,BECKETT>然后把复印件发给我们
<31-7,BECKETT>And then have them send us the copies.

773
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:29,040
<31-8,RYAN>我这就去办
<31-8,RYAN>Oh, I'm all over it.

774
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:30,910
<31-9,GATES>一辆巡逻车刚发现马修斯的车
<31-9,GATES>A cruiser just spotted Matthews' car

775
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,530
<31-9,GATES>停在皇后区的星爆旅馆
<31-9,GATES>at the Starburst Motel in Queens.

776
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:36,800
<31-10,CASTLE>我们当时就把杰瑞·泰森安置在那儿
<31-10,CASTLE>That's the same motel where we put up Jerry Tyson.

777
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:45,300
<31-10,CASTLE>多谢
<31-10,CASTLE>Thanks.

778
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:47,390
<32-1,ESPOSITO>前台说他在47号房
<32-1,ESPOSITO>Front desk says he's in room 47.

779
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,790
<32-2,CASTLE>泰森当时也在那间房
<32-2,CASTLE>That's the same room Tyson was in.

780
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,120
<32-3,ESPOSITO>那是他的车
<32-3,ESPOSITO>There's his car.

781
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:06,130
<32-3,ESPOSITO>47号房的灯亮着
<32-3,ESPOSITO>Lights out in room 47.

782
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:08,110
<32-4,BECKETT>听着  卡塞尔
<32-4,BECKETT>Listen, castle.

783
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,760
<32-4,BECKETT>我们不清楚上面什么情况
<32-4,BECKETT>We don't know what's waiting for us up there.

784
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:11,060
<32-4,BECKETT>你得待在这儿  好吗
<32-4,BECKETT>You need to stay here, okay?

785
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:12,830
<32-5,CASTLE>你小心点
<32-5,CASTLE>You be careful.

786
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,620
<32-6,BECKETT>走吧
<32-6,BECKETT>Let's go.

787
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:35,890
<32-7,ESPOSITO>警察  纽约警局
<32-7,ESPOSITO>Police! N.Y.P.D.!

788
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:58,130
<32-8,RYAN>3XK在哪
<32-8,RYAN>Where is 3XK?

789
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,930
<32-9,CASTLE>他在哪
<32-9,CASTLE>Where is he?!

790
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,440
<33-1,GATES>你还好吗  警探
<33-1,GATES>How are you, detective?

791
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:13,550
<33-2,ESPOSITO>那要看卡尔·马修斯这边进展如何
<33-2,ESPOSITO>Depends on how things go down with carl matthews.

792
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:18,140
<33-3,GATES>我让你们单独待会儿
<33-3,GATES>I'll give you two the room.

793
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:18,950
<33-4,LANIE>医生
<33-4,LANIE>Doctor.

794
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,710
<33-4,LANIE>长官
<33-4,LANIE>Sir.

795
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:26,630
<33-5,LANIE>什么样的变态混蛋为了一些卷宗杀两个人啊
<33-5,LANIE>What kind of twisted bastard murders two people for some files?

796
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,450
<33-6,ESPOSITO>就他那种
<33-6,ESPOSITO>That kind.

797
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:31,220
<33-7,LANIE>有证据证明是他杀了他了吗
<33-7,LANIE>Do we have proof that he killed him?

798
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:33,200
<33-8,ESPOSITO>证据不足
<33-8,ESPOSITO>Not enough.

799
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,970
<33-9,LANIE>那接下来怎么办
<33-9,LANIE>So what's gonna happen?

800
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:37,480
<33-10,ESPOSITO>我们要让他以为我们掌握的证据比实际的多
<33-10,ESPOSITO>We make him think that our case is stronger than it really is,

801
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:39,280
<33-10,ESPOSITO>让他招供
<33-10,ESPOSITO>Get him to confess.

802
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:41,340
<33-10,ESPOSITO>这是我们唯一的办法
<33-10,ESPOSITO>It's our only play.

803
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,150
<34-1,CARL MATTHEWS>你弄断了我三根肋骨
<34-1,CARL MATTHEWS>You broke three of my ribs.

804
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,140
<34-1,CARL MATTHEWS>抱歉
<34-1,CARL MATTHEWS>Oh, I'm sorry.

805
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:55,370
<34-2,CASTLE>我本来打算弄断两位数的呢
<34-2,CASTLE>I was going for double digits.

806
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:58,650
<34-3,BECKETT>我们要坦白地聊聊你的未来了  卡尔
<34-3,BECKETT>We need to have a candid conversation about your future, Carl.

807
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,590
<34-4,CASTLE>或者说没有未来
<34-4,CASTLE>Or lack thereof.

808
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:04,640
<34-5,BECKETT>我们在你背的背包里发现了钢制钓丝
<34-5,BECKETT>We found a steel fishing line in that backpack you were carrying.

809
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:05,580
<34-6,CASTLE>有趣的是
<34-6,CASTLE>Here's a fun fact.

810
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:07,320
<34-6,CASTLE>你知道当你切当一根金属丝时
<34-6,CASTLE>Did you know that when you cut a wire,

811
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:09,450
<34-6,CASTLE>它会留下微观的痕迹
<34-6,CASTLE>it leaves microscopic impressions--

812
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:12,410
<34-6,CASTLE>独一无二的金属微观痕迹
<34-6,CASTLE>unique microscopic impressions-- in the metal.

813
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:14,510
<34-7,BECKETT>我们因此知道背包里的这根线
<34-7,BECKETT>That's how we knew the wire in the pack

814
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:18,220
<34-7,BECKETT>和你用来吊丹尼尔·桑托斯的是同一卷线
<34-7,BECKETT>came from the same spool that you used to hang Daniel Santos.

815
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:20,520
<34-8,CASTLE>我们能证明你与帕姆·霍奇斯的死有关
<34-8,CASTLE>We can also connect you to the murder of Pam Hodges.

816
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:22,570
<34-8,CASTLE>同样的钓丝  同样的切割工具
<34-8,CASTLE>Same wire, same cutting tool.

817
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:24,200
<34-9,BECKETT>还有佛罗里达的谋杀案
<34-9,BECKETT>And to the murders in Florida.

818
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:24,790
<34-10,CASTLE>没错
<34-10,CASTLE>Oh, yes.

819
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,460
<34-10,CASTLE>你钟爱的钓丝又一次出现了
<34-10,CASTLE>Where your fondness for fishing line was once again on display.

820
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:30,370
<34-10,CASTLE>但我认为在法庭上
<34-10,CASTLE>But I think by this point in the trial,

821
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:33,680
<34-10,CASTLE>陪审团听到这里就够了
<34-10,CASTLE>the jurors will have heard enough.

822
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:38,980
<34-11,MATTHEWS>听起来只有大棒没有胡萝卜啊
<34-11,MATTHEWS>Sounds like a lot of sticks and no carrots.

823
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:50,470
<35-1,BECKETT>都招了吧  卡尔
<35-1,BECKETT>Confess to all the murders, Carl.

824
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,470
<35-1,BECKETT>佛罗里达那边会免去死刑
<35-1,BECKETT>And Florida will take the death penalty off the table.

825
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,630
<35-1,BECKETT>这是你能得到最好的条件
<35-1,BECKETT>It's the best you're gonna get.

826
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,630
<35-1,BECKETT>我是给你求生的机会
<35-1,BECKETT>I'm giving you life.

827
00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:00,530
<35-2,CASTLE>这比你给死者的多多了
<35-2,CASTLE>Which is more than you ever gave your victims.

828
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,050
<35-2,CASTLE>好吧
<35-2,CASTLE>All right.

829
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:15,000
<36-1,MATTHEWS>我都成功得手了
<36-1,MATTHEWS>I had a good run.

830
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:21,210
<37-1,BECKETT>有几起案件
<37-1,BECKETT>How many are there?

831
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:24,570
<37-2,MATTHEWS>一路往北有四起  如果你是要问这个
<37-2,MATTHEWS>Way north of four, if that's what you're asking.

832
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:27,570
<37-3,BECKETT>跟我说说帕姆·霍奇斯
<37-3,BECKETT>Tell me about Pam Hodges.

833
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,470
<37-3,BECKETT>她是个斗士
<37-3,BECKETT>She was a fighter.

834
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,470
<37-4,MATTHEWS>她脸上的表情
<37-4,MATTHEWS>And the look on her face--

835
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:34,210
<37-4,MATTHEWS>她渴望活下来
<37-4,MATTHEWS>She wanted to live so bad.

836
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:38,430
<37-4,MATTHEWS>但我让她站在运输托盘上  然后把它抽走
<37-4,MATTHEWS>But I stood her on a shipping pallet, then pulled it away.

837
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:43,620
<37-4,MATTHEWS>她的双脚刚好离地
<37-4,MATTHEWS>And her feet were just... just off the ground.

838
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:48,750
<37-4,MATTHEWS>我记得她的鞋尖摩擦着木板
<37-4,MATTHEWS>I remember the toes of her shoes scuffing the wood.

839
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:52,970
<37-4,MATTHEWS>一开始是慌张而迅速地
<37-4,MATTHEWS>All panicky and fast, at first.

840
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:55,290
<37-4,MATTHEWS>然后慢下来
<37-4,MATTHEWS>And then slower.

841
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,930
<37-4,MATTHEWS>最后停了下来
<37-4,MATTHEWS>And then not at all.

842
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,510
<37-5,BECKETT>那丹尼尔·桑托斯呢
<37-5,BECKETT>And what about Daniel Santos?

843
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:04,010
<37-6,MATTHEWS>对丹尼尔  我用的是卷线器
<37-6,MATTHEWS>With Daniel, I used the reel.

844
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:07,340
<37-6,MATTHEWS>我每收缩四分之一英寸  发出滴答的声响
<37-6,MATTHEWS>So with each click I drew in a quarter-inch of line.

845
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:08,970
<37-6,MATTHEWS>线就变得更紧
<37-6,MATTHEWS>It got tighter...

846
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:13,490
<37-6,MATTHEWS>然后把他一点一点吊起来
<37-6,MATTHEWS>And then lifted him bit... by bit.

847
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:16,460
<37-6,MATTHEWS>我每听到滴答一声  我就去看他
<37-6,MATTHEWS>Every time I hear a click, I'm right back with him.

848
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:21,220
<38-1,LANIE>你觉得我们要花多久
<38-1,LANIE>How long do you think it's gonna take

849
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:24,430
<38-1,LANIE>才能不去想他的所作所为
<38-1,LANIE>before we stop thinking about what he's done?

850
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,540
<38-1,LANIE>直到我们
<38-1,LANIE>Till we stop...

851
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:31,090
<38-1,LANIE>不再看着对方  就好像看着两个死人
<38-1,LANIE>looking at each other and seeing two dead people?

852
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:32,910
<38-2,ESPOSITO>我不知道
<38-2,ESPOSITO>I don't know.

853
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:40,390
<39-1,CASTLE>你为了杰瑞·泰森杀了他们
<39-1,CASTLE>You killed them both for Jerry Tyson.

854
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,460
<39-1,CASTLE>不  我欣赏他的杰作
<39-1,CASTLE>No, I admire his work.

855
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:44,890
<39-2,MATTHEWS>但不是这样  我只为自己卖命
<39-2,MATTHEWS>But no, I'm my own man.

856
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:47,310
<39-3,BECKETT>你为了自己  让他们改头换面
<39-3,BECKETT>And as your own man, you groomed them,

857
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:50,340
<39-3,BECKETT>用你在开曼群岛建的
<39-3,BECKETT>paid for Pam's apartment using the money

858
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:54,210
<39-3,BECKETT>格莱格斯·贝克公司账户里的钱为帕姆付房租
<39-3,BECKETT>from the Gregs-Baker account that you established in the Caymans.

859
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:56,080
<39-4,MATTHEWS>对  是这样的
<39-4,MATTHEWS>Yeah, that's right.

860
00:36:58,130 --> 00:36:59,600
<39-5,BECKETT>你在说谎
<39-5,BECKETT>You're lying.

861
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:02,670
<39-5,BECKETT>开户地点是在伯利兹  不是在开曼
<39-5,BECKETT>That account was opened in Belize, not the Caymans.

862
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:06,210
<39-6,CASTLE>因为你不是开户人  所以你不知道
<39-6,CASTLE>But you wouldn't know that because you weren't the one who opened it.

863
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:08,020
<39-6,CASTLE>杰瑞·泰森在哪
<39-6,CASTLE>Where's Jerry Tyson?

864
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:10,470
<39-7,MATTHEWS>据我所知他已经死了
<39-7,MATTHEWS>Uh, he's dead is my understanding.

865
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,710
<39-8,BECKETT>那你何必大费周章偷3XK的案卷
<39-8,BECKETT>So then why did you do all of this to steal the 3XK files?

866
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,480
<39-9,CASTLE>你为什么入住同样的汽车旅馆
<39-9,CASTLE>Why would you use the same motel?

867
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:20,630
<39-9,CASTLE>住在杰瑞·泰森逃出警方监控的房间里
<39-9,CASTLE>The same room where Jerry Tyson escaped police custody?

868
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:22,730
<39-10,MATTHEWS>有人推荐了那里
<39-10,MATTHEWS>Someone recommended it.

869
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,140
<39-10,MATTHEWS>另外无线上网免费
<39-10,MATTHEWS>Plus it had free wi-fii.

870
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:28,340
<39-11,MATTHEWS>我会供认我杀过的人
<39-11,MATTHEWS>I'll confess to my kills.

871
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:31,600
<39-11,MATTHEWS>一个不多  一个不少
<39-11,MATTHEWS>No more and no less.

872
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:35,880
<39-11,MATTHEWS>我还记得他们每一个人
<39-11,MATTHEWS>I recall every one of them

873
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:39,100
<39-11,MATTHEWS>细节记忆犹新
<39-11,MATTHEWS>in the clearest detail.

874
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:41,440
<39-11,MATTHEWS>所有的记忆
<39-11,MATTHEWS>All those memories.

875
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,840
<39-11,MATTHEWS>对我来说  我不会住在牢房里
<39-11,MATTHEWS>And to me, I won't be in a prison cell.

876
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:46,850
<39-11,MATTHEWS>而是会活在脑海里
<39-11,MATTHEWS>I'll be living here.

877
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:52,720
<39-11,MATTHEWS>我需要杆好笔和一个本
<39-11,MATTHEWS>Uh, I need a good pen and a pad of paper.

878
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:55,580
<39-11,MATTHEWS>其实  是好几个本
<39-11,MATTHEWS>Uh, several pads, in fact.

879
00:37:57,930 --> 00:38:01,830
<39-12,MATTHEWS>我知道你们觉得把一切都搞清了
<39-12,MATTHEWS>I know you think you've got this all figured out,

880
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,620
<39-12,MATTHEWS>但是你们没有
<39-12,MATTHEWS>But you don't.

881
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,610
<40-1,GATES>他是怎么说杰瑞·泰森的
<40-1,GATES>What did he say about Jerry Tyson?

882
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:21,400
<40-2,BECKETT>什么都没说
<40-2,BECKETT>Nothing.

883
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:27,420
<40-3,GATES>这些文件被盗是个重大的安全漏洞
<40-3,GATES>The theft of those files was a major security breach.

884
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:31,410
<40-3,GATES>警局会很快把这件事糊弄过去的
<40-3,GATES>Be aware that the department is eager to put that behind them.

885
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,390
<40-3,GATES>这很丢人
<40-3,GATES>It's an embarrassment.

886
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:37,550
<40-4,BECKETT>长官  如果有探长提出泰森
<40-4,BECKETT>Sir, if a detective were to suggest that tyson,

887
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,790
<40-4,BECKETT>这个当局已经宣布死亡的人
<40-4,BECKETT>a man that the department's already declared dead,

888
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,340
<40-4,BECKETT>可能还活着
<40-4,BECKETT>might still be alive--

889
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:43,900
<40-5,GATES>那就更丢人了
<40-5,GATES>An even bigger embarrassment.

890
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:48,370
<40-5,GATES>所以如果你要提出这一观点
<40-5,GATES>So if you're gonna make that claim...

891
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:51,860
<40-5,GATES>要保证有理有据
<40-5,GATES>make damn sure you can back it up.

892
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:57,520
<40-6,BECKETT>我会记住的  长官
<40-6,BECKETT>I will keep that in mind, Sir.

893
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:02,660
<41-1,CASTLE>刚才说什么了
<41-1,CASTLE>What was that about?

894
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:06,820
<41-2,BECKETT>如果泰森还活着  纽约警局也不想知道
<41-2,BECKETT>That if Tyson is alive, the N.Y.P.D. doesn't wanna know about it.

895
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:07,980
<41-3,CASTLE>那你呢
<41-3,CASTLE>And what about you?

896
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:09,150
<41-3,CASTLE>你觉得他回来了吗
<41-3,CASTLE>Do you think he's back?

897
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,150
<41-4,BECKETT>卡塞尔  没有人能死而复生
<41-4,BECKETT>Castle, people don't just rise from the dead.

898
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,880
<41-4,BECKETT>所以我还在寻找其他解释
<41-4,BECKETT>So I'm still looking at other explanations.

899
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:14,640
<41-4,BECKETT>但是如果他真逍遥法外  我们得找到他
<41-4,BECKETT>But if he is out there, we have to find him.

900
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:16,610
<41-5,CASTLE>我们从卡尔·马修斯那里得不到什么了
<41-5,CASTLE>We're not gonna get any more out of Carl Matthews.

901
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,570
<41-5,CASTLE>那我们从哪里开始
<41-5,CASTLE>So... where do we start?

902
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:19,720
<41-5,CASTLE>伙计们
<41-5,CASTLE>Guys,

903
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:22,130
<41-6,RYAN>我觉得我在发过来的监狱报告中有所发现
<41-6,RYAN>I think I found something in those prison records that got sent over.

904
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:24,740
<41-6,RYAN>你们还记得泰森在被释放前
<41-6,RYAN>Do you remember right before he was released from prison,

905
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:26,110
<41-6,RYAN>被狱友殴打了吗
<41-6,RYAN>Tyson got beat up by some inmates?

906
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,780
<41-7,BECKETT>对  这就是我们把他放出来的原因
<41-7,BECKETT>Yeah, that's why we pulled him out of there.

907
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:28,860
<41-7,BECKETT>我们以为他有生命危险
<41-7,BECKETT>We thought his life was in danger,

908
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:30,820
<41-7,BECKETT>但是结果是他导演的这一切
<41-7,BECKETT>But it turns out, he just staged the whole thing.

909
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:32,460
<41-8,RYAN>对  但是殴打是真的
<41-8,RYAN>Right, but the beat down was real.

910
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:34,560
<41-8,RYAN>他被送到了医务室
<41-8,RYAN>He got sent to the infirmary.

911
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:36,130
<41-8,RYAN>看看是谁治疗了他
<41-8,RYAN>Look who was attending him.

912
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,270
<41-9,CASTLE>凯莉·尼曼医生
<41-9,CASTLE>Dr. Kelly Nieman?

913
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,950
<41-10,RYAN>她志愿成为一名监狱医生
<41-10,RYAN>She volunteered as a prison doc.

914
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,900
<41-10,RYAN>更重要的是  她在泰森到那儿的那周开始工作
<41-10,RYAN>More importantly, she started there the week Tyson arrived,

915
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:43,460
<41-10,RYAN>他释放后她就辞职了
<41-10,RYAN>and she quit the day he was released.

916
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:44,820
<41-11,CASTLE>她以前就认识他
<41-11,CASTLE>She knew him from before.

917
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:46,510
<41-11,CASTLE>她是为了接近他才接下这个工作
<41-11,CASTLE>She took that job to be close to him.

918
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,970
<41-11,CASTLE>她是泰森的女朋友
<41-11,CASTLE>She's gotta be Tyson's girlfriend.

919
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:49,750
<41-12,BECKETT>他把自己会的一切都教给了她
<41-12,BECKETT>He taught her everything he knew.

920
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,720
<41-12,BECKETT>把她带回来
<41-12,BECKETT>Get her back here.

921
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:51,970
<41-13,RYAN>她不接电话
<41-13,RYAN>She's not answering her cell.

922
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:54,180
<41-13,RYAN>也不在公寓里
<41-13,RYAN>She's not at her apartment either.

923
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:04,630
<42-1,RYAN>该死
<42-1,RYAN>Damn it!

924
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,890
<42-2,ESPOSITO>这就是你找不到她的原因
<42-2,ESPOSITO>This explains why you couldn't reach her.

925
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:06,820
<42-2,ESPOSITO>她跑了
<42-2,ESPOSITO>She bolted.

926
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:09,300
<42-3,RYAN>如果这和泰森有关  他肯定也跑了
<42-3,RYAN>And if Tyson's in this, he did, too.

927
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:13,430
<42-4,CASTLE>这家诊所生机勃勃的样子还历历在目呢
<42-4,CASTLE>Seems like only yesterday this place was a thriving medical practice,

928
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,200
<42-4,CASTLE>但是  都过去了
<42-4,CASTLE>but... it was yesterday.

929
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:19,110
<42-5,BECKETT>我们还是需要检查这个地方
<42-5,BECKETT>We still gotta clear the place.

930
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,940
<43-1,CASTLE>贝克特
<43-1,CASTLE>Beckett?

931
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:33,940
<43-2,BECKETT>怎么了
<43-2,BECKETT>What is it?

933
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:49,960
<43-2,BECKETT>好的  谢谢
<43-2,BECKETT>Okay, all right, thanks.

934
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:54,440
<43-2,BECKETT>所有3XK案卷的电子记录也都被删除了
<43-2,BECKETT>So all of the electronic records from the 3xk cases were deleted, too.

935
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:56,650
<44-1,BECKETT>不仅如此  似乎被害人
<44-1,BECKETT>Not only that, but it looks like our victims

936
00:40:56,660 --> 00:41:00,270
<44-1,BECKETT>拿走了其他26起悬案的证据和文件
<44-1,BECKETT>took evidence and files from 26 other unsolved murders.

937
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,190
<44-2,CASTLE>那些案子也是泰森干的吗
<44-2,CASTLE>More murders committed by Tyson?

938
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,850
<44-3,BECKETT>或者是凯莉·尼曼
<44-3,BECKETT>Or Kelly Nieman.

939
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:04,540
<44-3,BECKETT>我说不清  卡塞尔
<44-3,BECKETT>I don't know, Castle.

940
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:07,010
<44-3,BECKETT>我开始觉得她也有这个能力
<44-3,BECKETT>I'm starting to think she'd be capable of it, too.

941
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:09,000
<44-4,CASTLE>泰森确实是挑对了女人
<44-4,CASTLE>Tyson sure did pick the right woman.

942
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:10,340
<44-4,CASTLE>而且她还能改变他的容貌
<44-4,CASTLE>Plus she can change his appearance.

943
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:11,380
<44-4,CASTLE>没准她已经这么干了
<44-4,CASTLE>Maybe she already has.

944
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:13,250
<44-5,BECKETT>你是觉得他还活着
<44-5,BECKETT>You're still assuming that he's alive.

945
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:14,810
<44-5,BECKETT>你不这么认为吗
<44-5,BECKETT>Aren't you?

946
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:16,060
<44-6,CASTLE>他一定还活着
<44-6,CASTLE>He must be.

947
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:18,380
<44-6,CASTLE>否则  为什么要安排这一切偷走文件呢
<44-6,CASTLE>Otherwise, why orchestrate all this to steal the file?

948
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:20,850
<44-7,BECKETT>或许她只是想留住他的记忆
<44-7,BECKETT>Well, maybe she just wanted to keep his memory alive.

949
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:23,170
<44-7,BECKETT>或者是他的遗产
<44-7,BECKETT>Or his legacy.

950
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:26,640
<44-8,CASTLE>这让他们两个人一样危险
<44-8,CASTLE>And that makes her just as dangerous as he is.

951
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,110
<44-8,CASTLE>她还在逍遥法外
<44-8,CASTLE>She's still out there somewhere

952
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,760
<44-8,CASTLE>和杰瑞·泰森在一起  或独自一人
<44-8,CASTLE>with Jerry Tyson or without him.

953
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:47,020
<44-8,CASTLE>*我们还会再见*
<44-8,CASTLE>*We'll meet again*

954
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:49,970
<44-8,CASTLE>*虽不知何地*
<44-8,CASTLE>*Don't know where*

955
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:52,930
<44-8,CASTLE>*虽不知何时*
<44-8,CASTLE>*Don't know when*

956
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:57,080
<44-8,CASTLE>*但我知道你我一定会再见*
<44-8,CASTLE>*But I know we'll meet again*

957
00:41:57,090 --> 00:42:01,700
<44-8,CASTLE>*在一个阳光灿烂的日子*
<44-8,CASTLE>*Some sunny day*

958
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:07,570
<44-8,CASTLE>*要一直微笑*
<44-8,CASTLE>*Keep smiling through*

959
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:10,140
<44-8,CASTLE>*正如你*
<44-8,CASTLE>*Just like you*

960
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:13,270
<44-8,CASTLE>*一直以来的那样*
<44-8,CASTLE>*Always do*

961
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,700
<44-8,CASTLE>*直到蓝天*
<44-8,CASTLE>*Till the blue skies*

962
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:18,350
<44-8,CASTLE>*将乌云*
<44-8,CASTLE>*Drive the dark clouds*

963
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:22,320
<44-8,CASTLE>*驱散*
<44-8,CASTLE>*Far away*
