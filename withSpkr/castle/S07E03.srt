<2-15,BECKETT>嗯...我们还没...
<2-15,BECKETT>Yeah, I mean, we haven't since...

25
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,920
<2-16,CASTLE>是啊  因为发生了那么多事
<2-16,CASTLE>Yeah, well, given everything that's happened,

26
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,370
<2-16,CASTLE>我以为你是没...准备好呢
<2-16,CASTLE>I thought you just... you weren't...Ready.

27
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:40,650
<2-17,BECKETT>我以为是你没准备好
<2-17,BECKETT>I thought that you weren't ready.

28
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,340
<2-18,CASTLE>我准备好好的了
<2-18,CASTLE>I'm ready.

<2-18,CASTLE>我...
<2-18,CASTLE>I'm... I

30
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,570
<2-18,CASTLE>绝对准备好了
<2-18,CASTLE>I'm... I'm so ready.

31
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,950
<2-19,BECKETT>我也准备好了  我真的准备好了
<2-19,BECKETT>I-I'm ready, too. Like, I'm really ready.

32
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:51,030
<2-20,CASTLE>好吧  那我们在等什么啊
<2-20,CASTLE>Okay. Well, then what are we waiting for?

33
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:00,030
<2-20,CASTLE>怎么了

00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,790
<3-2,BECKETT>我还会穿你的情人节礼物
<3-2,BECKETT>I'll even slip into that valentine's day gift you got me.

37
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:06,650
<3-3,CASTLE>就是那件...
<3-3,CASTLE>You mean the one with...

38
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,060
<3-3,CASTLE>-那个...  -没错
<3-3,CASTLE>- With... - Yeah.

39
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:18,850
<3-3,CASTLE>穿过他胸膛的那是台球杆吗
<3-3,CASTLE>Is that a pool cue through his chest?

40
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,790
<4-1,CASTLE>看来不用问死因了
<4-1,CASTLE>Guess we don't have to ask how he died.

41
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:24,850
<4-2,LANIE PARISH>下腔静脉被刺穿
<4-2,LANIE PARISH>Inferior vena cava was punctured.

42
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:26,140
<4-2,LANIE PARISH>他数分钟内流血致死
<4-2,LANIE PARISH>He bled out in minutes.

43
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,380
<4-3,BECKETT>死亡时间呢
<4-3,BECKETT>And when did that happen?

44
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,400
<4-4,JAVIER ESPOSITO>楼下的夫妇
<4-4,JAVIER ESPOSITO>The couple in the unit downstairs

45
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,920
<4-4,JAVIER ESPOSITO>7点50听到了打斗声便报了警
<4-4,JAVIER ESPOSITO>heard a struggle at 7:50 and called 911.

46
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,660
<4-4,JAVIER ESPOSITO>他们说听上去打得很厉害
<4-4,JAVIER ESPOSITO>They said it sounded like a hell of a fight.

47
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,420
<4-4,JAVIER ESPOSITO>被害人名叫威廉·法维克  25岁
<4-4,JAVIER ESPOSITO>Victim's name is William Fairwick. He was 25.

48
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,570
<4-5,BECKETT>还有什么别的信息吗
<4-5,BECKETT>What else do we know about him?

49
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:39,510
<4-6,ESPOSITO>除了知道他喜欢无政府主义纹身
<4-6,ESPOSITO>Other than his taste in anarchy tattoos

50
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,570
<4-6,ESPOSITO>和撒旦图样  其他还不清楚
<4-6,ESPOSITO>and satanic design, not much yet.

51
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:44,190
<4-6,ESPOSITO>他的笔记本和手机都有密码
<4-6,ESPOSITO>His laptop and phone were both password protected.

52
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,970
<4-7,KEVIN RYAN>抱歉  地铁好堵
<4-7,KEVIN RYAN>So sorry. Subway took forever.

53
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:48,180
<4-8,JAVIER ESPOSITO>哥们  你是待命人员
<4-8,JAVIER ESPOSITO>Bro, you're supposed to be on call.

54
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,620
<4-8,JAVIER ESPOSITO>你怎么一身酒气
<4-8,JAVIER ESPOSITO>Why do you smell like a wino?

55
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,940
<4-9,RYAN>我跟珍妮吃晚饭了
<4-9,RYAN>Oh, I was at dinner with Jenny,

56
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:54,270
<4-9,RYAN>我跑出餐馆的时候被人洒上了酒
<4-9,RYAN>and someone spilled a drink on me as I rushed out.

58
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,410
<4-10,CASTLE>嗯
<4-10,CASTLE>Yeah.

59
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:00,780
<4-12,CASTLE>这一道碎片是从左及右的
<4-12,CASTLE>The debris from this breakage goes from left to right.

60
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:02,720
<4-13,BECKETT>那么行凶的是左撇子
<4-13,BECKETT>So, whoever did it was left handed.

61
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,770
<4-14,ESPOSITO>而且应该是受邀入门
<4-14,ESPOSITO>Most likely invited.

62
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:06,000
<4-14,ESPOSITO>门窗都从里面锁好了
<4-14,ESPOSITO>All the doors and windows were locked from the inside,

63
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,620
<4-14,ESPOSITO>虽然打得一团乱  但没有强行闯入的迹象
<4-14,ESPOSITO>And despite the wreckage, there's no sign of forced entry.

64
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:09,700
<4-15,BECKETT>有什么被盗吗
<4-15,BECKETT>Was anything stolen?

65
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,260
<4-16,ESPOSITO>没什么明显的贵重物品被盗
<4-16,ESPOSITO>None of the obvious valuables,

66
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,610
<4-16,ESPOSITO>但我在他的袜子抽屉最里面发现了这个
<4-16,ESPOSITO>but I did find this stashed in the back of his sock drawer.

67
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,270
<4-16,ESPOSITO>是两万块现金
<4-16,ESPOSITO>It's $20,000 in cash.

68
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:17,690
<4-16,ESPOSITO>凶手可能就是在找这个
<4-16,ESPOSITO>Could be what the killer was looking for.

69
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:19,370
<4-17,BECKETT>留在家里挺冒险啊
<4-17,BECKETT>That's pretty risky leaving it here.

70
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:20,820
<4-17,BECKETT>这家伙是做什么的
<4-17,BECKETT>What did this guy do for a living?

71
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,850
<4-18,RYAN>看啊  我找到了他的工作证
<4-18,RYAN>Hey, check it out. I found his work I.D.

72
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:27,520
<4-18,RYAN>上面写着格林布拉特保险公司
<4-18,RYAN>It says here "Greenblatt Insurance."

73
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,280
<4-18,RYAN>我去查查  看看有没有关联
<4-18,RYAN>I'll track it down, see if it has any relevance.

74
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,490
<4-19,HENRY WRIGHT>天呐  威尔
<4-19,HENRY WRIGHT>Oh, my god, Will?!

75
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,630
<4-19,HENRY WRIGHT>怎么回事
<4-19,HENRY WRIGHT>What happened?

76
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:38,120
<5-1,HENRY>嗯  我们做了两年邻居了
<5-1,HENRY>Yeah, we've been neighbors for two years.

77
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,520
<5-1,HENRY>我们下班后有时一起玩游戏
<5-1,HENRY>We played video games after work sometimes.

78
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:42,280
<5-1,HENRY>我就是来看他在不在
<5-1,HENRY>I was just seeing if he was around.

79
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,940
<5-2,BECKETT>你整晚都在吗  亨利
<5-2,BECKETT>Were you here all night, Henry?

80
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:44,890
<5-3,HENRY>是的
<5-3,HENRY>Yeah.

81
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:46,550
<5-4,BECKETT>那你听到什么声音了吗
<5-4,BECKETT>So, did you hear anything?

82
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,230
<5-5,HENRY>抱歉  我一整晚都在围攻柯巴尔德城堡
<5-5,HENRY>Sorry, I've been laying siege to the fortress of Kobald all night.

83
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,750
<5-5,HENRY>大地远征里的吗
<5-5,HENRY>From "Terra Quest"?

84
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,540
<5-6,CASTLE>你是什么  狡猾的西部食尸鬼
<5-6,CASTLE>What are you... a wily westland ghoul?

85
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,450
<5-6,CASTLE>凶狠的南方河怪
<5-6,CASTLE>Menacing south river orc?

86
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:57,640
<5-6,CASTLE>东山妖精
<5-6,CASTLE>East mountain goblin.

87
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:00,570
<5-7,HENRY>其实  我是国王
<5-7,HENRY>I'm, uh, their king, actually.

88
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:02,680
<5-8,CASTLE>厉害啊
<5-8,CASTLE>Respect.

89
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,050
<5-9,BECKETT>总之  回到现实世界中
<5-9,BECKETT>Anyway, back to the real world.

90
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:07,230
<5-9,BECKETT>威尔最近有什么奇怪之处吗
<5-9,BECKETT>So, did Will exhibit any odd behavior recently?

91
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:09,030
<5-10,HENRY>没有  跟往常一样啊
<5-10,HENRY>No. It was pretty much the same routine.

92
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:11,230
<5-10,HENRY>早上去上班  晚上回来
<5-10,HENRY>I mean, he'd go to work in the morning, come home at night.

93
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:13,240
<5-11,BECKETT>好吧  他提到过其他的朋友吗
<5-11,BECKETT>Okay. Did he talk about any of his other friends?

94
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,340
<5-11,BECKETT>谁最近跟他有矛盾
<5-11,BECKETT>Was he having troubles with anyone?

95
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:16,960
<5-12,HENRY>我们不怎么谈现实生活的事
<5-12,HENRY>We didn't talk much about real-life stuff.

96
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,670
<5-12,HENRY>主要就是交流游戏
<5-12,HENRY>It was mainly just "Terra Quest."

97
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:20,640
<5-12,HENRY>但如果他遇到了麻烦
<5-12,HENRY>But if he was having a problem,

98
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,610
<5-12,HENRY>大概跟他赚钱的生意有关
<5-12,HENRY>it probably had something to do with how he made his money.

99
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,280
<5-13,BECKETT>在格林布拉特保险公司吗
<5-13,BECKETT>At Greenblatt Insurance?

100
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,610
<5-14,HENRY>理赔人只是他的日间工作
<5-14,HENRY>Claims adjuster, that... that was just his day job.

101
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,980
<5-14,HENRY>他每晚在切尔西台球厅能挣很多钱
<5-14,HENRY>He was making a fortune every night over at Chelsea Billiards.

102
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,980
<5-14,HENRY>他是个台球赌棍
<5-14,HENRY>Guy was a pool hustler.

103
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:34,900
<5-15,BECKETT>这就解释了袜子抽屉里的现金
<5-15,BECKETT>That explains the cold, hard cash we found in his sock drawer.

104
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,940
<5-16,CASTLE>还有穿过他胸膛的台球杆
<5-16,CASTLE>And the pool cue we found in his chest.

105
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:43,060
<6-1,FATS SHEPHERD>嗯  威尔是在我这边工作
<6-1,FATS SHEPHERD>Yeah. Will worked my tables.

106
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,950
<6-1,FATS SHEPHERD>他是我见过的最厉害的
<6-1,FATS SHEPHERD>He was the best I ever seen.

107
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,630
<6-1,FATS SHEPHERD>什么角度都会打
<6-1,FATS SHEPHERD>Knew all the angles.

108
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:49,060
<6-2,BECKETT>被他赢钱的人有谁对他有不满吗
<6-2,BECKETT>Anyone he took for money ever have a problem with him?

109
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:51,640
<6-3,SHEPHERD>当然  但我们主要拿华尔街的二货开刀
<6-3,SHEPHERD>Sure, but will mostly hustled Wall Street tools

110
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,160
<6-3,SHEPHERD>一场也就一千
<6-3,SHEPHERD>for 10 bills a game.

111
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:58,370
<6-3,SHEPHERD>输个一两千  对他们来说不算什么
<6-3,SHEPHERD>Losing a grand here or there is chump change for them.

112
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,870
<6-3,SHEPHERD>那些人是不会为了一场赌博杀人的
<6-3,SHEPHERD>None of those guys would ever kill will over a bet.

113
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,900
<6-4,CASTLE>但有人会吗
<6-4,CASTLE>But there are guys that would?

114
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,510
<6-5,SHEPHERD>威尔一直在我这种高档俱乐部干活儿
<6-5,SHEPHERD>Will always worked - the upscale clubs like mine

115
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:09,310
<6-5,SHEPHERD>拿客人的钱是很安全的
<6-5,SHEPHERD>where it's safe to take money off the clientele.

116
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,160
<6-5,SHEPHERD>但最近  我听说他开始在布鲁克林的
<6-5,SHEPHERD>But recently, I'd heard that he started hustling

117
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:15,230
<6-5,SHEPHERD>奥尼尔酒吧赌博
<6-5,SHEPHERD>out in Brooklyn at O'neill's.

118
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:18,470
<6-5,SHEPHERD>那里净是重罪犯和人渣
<6-5,SHEPHERD>That place is full of felons and lowlifes.

119
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:20,720
<6-6,BECKETT>知道他为什么跑去了那儿吗
<6-6,BECKETT>Any idea why he decided to move his game up there?

120
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,700
<6-7,SHEPHERD>肯定不是为了钱  他在这儿赚的很多
<6-7,SHEPHERD>Well, it wasn't for the money. I mean, he was cleaning up here.

121
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:25,730
<6-7,SHEPHERD>但是
<6-7,SHEPHERD>But, uh...

122
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,650
<6-7,SHEPHERD>但是人说话  做事
<6-7,SHEPHERD>What people say and do...

123
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,040
<6-7,SHEPHERD>并不总合乎逻辑的
<6-7,SHEPHERD>doesn't always make sense.

124
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,010
<6-8,BECKETT>谢泼德先生
<6-8,BECKETT>Mr. Shepherd?

125
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,080
<6-9,SHEPHERD>也许只是我多心了
<6-9,SHEPHERD>No, it's probably nothing.

126
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:40,490
<6-9,SHEPHERD>说来挺傻的
<6-9,SHEPHERD>It's stupid, even.

127
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:42,470
<6-10,BECKETT>要是能帮我们
<6-10,BECKETT>It's not stupid if it could help us

128
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:44,420
<6-10,BECKETT>了解威尔的情况就不傻
<6-10,BECKETT>fill in the blanks on Will's life.

129
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:52,800
<6-11,SHEPHERD>我曾问过他  他怎么这么厉害
<6-11,SHEPHERD>I once asked him - how he got to be so good.

130
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,580
<6-11,SHEPHERD>他跟我说他去了十字路口
<6-11,SHEPHERD>He told me he went down to the crossroads,

131
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,390
<6-11,SHEPHERD>跟魔鬼做了交易  换来天赋
<6-11,SHEPHERD>made a deal with the devil for his talent.

132
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,360
<6-11,SHEPHERD>我觉得  他只是在开玩笑对吧
<6-11,SHEPHERD>I figured that's -- that -- that's got to be a joke, right?

133
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:04,620
<6-11,SHEPHERD>但有天晚上  他看起来很紧张
<6-11,SHEPHERD>But the other night, he looked nervous.

134
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,680
<6-11,SHEPHERD>很明显在害怕
<6-11,SHEPHERD>I mean, downright scared,

135
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,610
<6-11,SHEPHERD>所以我问他说  你怎么啦
<6-11,SHEPHERD>so I asked him, I said, "What's going on?"

136
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,580
<6-11,SHEPHERD>你知道他说什么吗
<6-11,SHEPHERD>You know what he told me?

137
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:12,510
<6-12,CASTLE>不  但我绝对想知道
<6-12,CASTLE>No, but I want to know.

138
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,090
<6-13,SHEPHERD>他说他那天没在开玩笑
<6-13,SHEPHERD>He said it wasn't a joke.

139
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:19,760
<6-13,SHEPHERD>他说他大限已到
<6-13,SHEPHERD>He said his time was up --

140
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:23,380
<6-13,SHEPHERD>他要失去他的灵魂了
<6-13,SHEPHERD>that he was about to lose his soul.

141
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,890
<6-13,SHEPHERD>我说了的  很傻对吧
<6-13,SHEPHERD>Well, like I said, though, uh, stupid, right?

142
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:40,250
<6-14,BECKETT>埃斯波有线索  在分局等我们呢
<6-14,BECKETT>Espo's got something for us at the precinct.

143
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:43,910
<7-1,CASTLE>一个人说他要失去灵魂了紧接着就应验了
<7-1,CASTLE>A guy says he's gonna lose his soul and then he does?

144
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:44,880
<7-1,CASTLE>难道不诡异吗
<7-1,CASTLE>How creepy is that?

145
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,610
<7-2,BECKETT>是那人惹上了恶棍招致了死亡
<7-2,BECKETT>The guy was hustling felons and he got himself killed.

146
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:50,380
<7-2,BECKETT>这不是诡异  不过恐怕是死因
<7-2,BECKETT>That's not creepy, that's probable cause.

147
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:52,040
<7-2,BECKETT>被害人的雇主查到什么了吗
<7-2,BECKETT>Anything on our vic's employer?

148
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,910
<7-2,BECKETT>是的
<7-2,BECKETT>Uh, yeah.

149
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:55,620
<7-3,RYAN>我查到格林布拉特公司一个1-800打头的电话号
<7-3,RYAN>I got a 1-800 number for greenblatt insurance,

150
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,130
<7-3,RYAN>但他们明天才营业呢
<7-3,RYAN>but they're closed until tomorrow.

151
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:58,250
<7-4,BECKETT>你回家时能顺路去一趟
<7-4,BECKETT>Can you stop by O'Neill's bar

152
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,710
<7-4,BECKETT>布鲁克林的奥尼尔酒吧吗
<7-4,BECKETT>in Brooklyn on your way home,

153
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,500
<7-4,BECKETT>查访一下是否有人见过被害人
<7-4,BECKETT>ask around about the vic?

154
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,430
<7-5,BECKETT>要是珍妮在等你就算了
<7-5,BECKETT>Unless Jenny needs you?

155
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,530
<7-6,RYAN>没  可以的
<7-6,RYAN>No, all good.

156
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,450
<7-7,BECKETT>埃斯波  查到什么了
<7-7,BECKETT>Espo, what do we got?

157
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:09,260
<8-1,ESPOSITO>我拿到了威尔公寓的监控录像
<8-1,ESPOSITO>I pulled security footage from Will's building.

158
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,320
<8-1,ESPOSITO>电梯旁有个摄像头
<8-1,ESPOSITO>There's a security camera in the elevator area

159
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,490
<8-1,ESPOSITO>刚好能看到威尔的房间
<8-1,ESPOSITO>slightly angled - towards Will's apartment.

160
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:15,250
<8-2,TORY ELLIS>我设法放大了录像
<8-2,TORY ELLIS>I was able to magnify the footage.

161
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,800
<8-3,BECKETT>很好  那我们就能看到
<8-3,BECKETT>Great, then we should be able to pull an image

162
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,310
<8-3,BECKETT>凶手离开他房间的过程了
<8-3,BECKETT>of our killer leaving the apartment.

163
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,180
<8-4,ESPOSITO>按理说没错  但是  你自己看吧
<8-4,ESPOSITO>We should, yeah, but... Watch.

164
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:26,120
<8-5,ESPOSITO>这是报警电话前一分钟的录像
<8-5,ESPOSITO>This is a minute before the 911 call.

165
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:28,450
<8-6,TORY>这是报警一分钟后的
<8-6,TORY>And this is minutes later.

166
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,410
<8-7,ESPOSITO>门自己开了又关上
<8-7,ESPOSITO>The door opens and closes on its own,

167
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,060
<8-7,ESPOSITO>之后到警察到达前
<8-7,ESPOSITO>and then no one enters

168
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,090
<8-7,ESPOSITO>没有一个人进出过那个房间
<8-7,ESPOSITO>or exits the apartment until police arrive,

169
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:36,820
<8-7,ESPOSITO>所有的窗户  都是从里面锁上的
<8-7,ESPOSITO>and all the windows were locked from the inside.

170
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:37,950
<8-8,BECKETT>这不可能
<8-8,BECKETT>That's impossible.

171
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,800
<8-8,BECKETT>凶手肯定用某种方法进出过房间
<8-8,BECKETT>The killer had to get in and out somehow.

172
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,040
<8-9,CASTLE>能再放一遍吗
<8-9,CASTLE>Uh, can you play that again?

173
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,500
<8-10,CASTLE>凶手就在那儿
<8-10,CASTLE>There's your killer right there.

174
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:47,800
<8-10,CASTLE>还不明白吗
<8-10,CASTLE>Don't you see?

175
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:49,530
<8-10,CASTLE>威尔和魔鬼做了交易
<8-10,CASTLE>Will made a deal with the devil.

176
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:51,990
<8-10,CASTLE>合同到期了  付出代价的时候到了
<8-10,CASTLE>The contract was up, so it was time to pay.

177
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:54,720
<8-10,CASTLE>魔鬼如期而至  完成了交易
<8-10,CASTLE>The devil came and got his due.

187
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:05,520
<8-10,CASTLE>是吗
<8-10,CASTLE>Really?

188
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:07,330
<9-1,BECKETT>魔鬼就是这么杀人的吗
<9-1,BECKETT>That's how the devil is gonna kill someone --

189
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:09,400
<9-1,BECKETT>用一根折断的台球杆
<9-1,BECKETT>using a broken pool stick?

190
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:10,730
<9-2,CASTLE>也许是黑暗王子想要
<9-2,CASTLE>Well, perhaps the prince of darkness

191
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:11,920
<9-2,CASTLE>以此传达一个讯息
<9-2,CASTLE>is trying to make a point.

192
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,010
<9-2,CASTLE>你以此为生  也就因此而死
<9-2,CASTLE>You live by the cue, you die by the cue.

193
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:16,430
<9-3,BECKETT>我以为他一般都直接让地狱猎犬动手呢
<9-3,BECKETT>Thought he usually just released the hell hounds.

194
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,770
<9-4,CASTLE>好吧  那你怎么解释
<9-4,CASTLE>All right, then how do you explain

195
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:18,940
<9-4,CASTLE>我们看到的录像
<9-4,CASTLE>what we just saw back there?

196
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:19,850
<9-4,CASTLE>简单
<9-4,CASTLE>Easy.

197
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:23,200
<9-5,BECKETT>威尔跑进屋时并没有关门
<9-5,BECKETT>Will didn't close the door all the way when he came back in.

198
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,280
<9-5,BECKETT>窗户开着
<9-5,BECKETT>Our window was open.

199
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,100
<9-5,BECKETT>凶手从窗户进来
<9-5,BECKETT>The killer came through,

200
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,340
<9-5,BECKETT>一股狂风进来吹开了门
<9-5,BECKETT>and this huge gust of wind forced the door open

201
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,770
<9-5,BECKETT>风停后门就关上了
<9-5,BECKETT>and then shut when they left.

202
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,050
<9-6,CASTLE>但埃斯波西托说了
<9-6,CASTLE>But Esposito said

203
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:34,530
<9-6,CASTLE>所有窗户都是从里面锁上的
<9-6,CASTLE>all the windows were locked from the inside.

204
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,420
<9-7,BECKETT>凶手是职业杀手
<9-7,BECKETT>Our killer's a pro.

205
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,860
<9-7,BECKETT>他知道怎么从外面锁上窗户
<9-7,BECKETT>He knows how to reset interior locks.

206
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,810
<9-8,CASTLE>但威尔住19层  大楼还没逃生梯
<9-8,CASTLE>Except Will lives on the 19th floor with no fire escape.

207
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:43,400
<9-9,BECKETT>拜托  卡塞尔
<9-9,BECKETT>Come on, Castle.

208
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,600
<9-9,BECKETT>你知道要想进没有逃生梯的高层的窗户
<9-9,BECKETT>You know that there are plenty of ways to access windows

209
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,140
<9-9,BECKETT>也是有很多办法的
<9-9,BECKETT>on high-level floors without a fire escape.

210
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,030
<9-10,CASTLE>没错  对蜘蛛侠来说的话
<9-10,CASTLE>Yes. If you're spider-man.

211
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,200
<9-11,BECKETT>凶手不是蜘蛛侠
<9-11,BECKETT>Our killer's not spider-man.

212
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:53,100
<9-12,CASTLE>同意  因为凶手是魔鬼
<9-12,CASTLE>Agreed... Because it's the devil.

213
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:55,200
<9-13,BECKETT>此案中只有一个地方能找到魔鬼
<9-13,BECKETT>The only place - that we're gonna find the devil

214
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,060
<9-13,BECKETT>因为关键[魔鬼]藏在细节里
<9-13,BECKETT>in this case is in the details.

215
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,420
<9-13,BECKETT>只要对威尔的生活有了更详尽的了解
<9-13,BECKETT>Once we find out more about Will's life,

216
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:02,620
<9-13,BECKETT>我们就能揭开  他人类敌人的神秘面纱
<9-13,BECKETT>then we will uncover - who his earthbound enemy is.

217
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,580
<9-14,CASTLE>明天再揭
<9-14,CASTLE>Tomorrow.

218
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:07,120
<9-14,CASTLE>今晚  我想回家去玩
<9-14,CASTLE>Tonight, I have something I'd like to uncover

219
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:08,610
<9-14,CASTLE>脱衣游戏
<9-14,CASTLE>back at home.

220
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:10,380
<9-15,CASTLE>不要接
<9-15,CASTLE>Don't answer that.

221
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,160
<9-15,CASTLE>不要  看都不要看
<9-15,CASTLE>Don't. Don't even. Don't look at it.

222
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:15,120
<9-15,CASTLE>-别接  -我只是
<9-15,CASTLE>- Don't answer it. - I just want --

223
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,210
<9-15,CASTLE>不要接
<9-15,CASTLE>Don't pick it up.

224
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:17,970
<9-17,CASTLE>你接了
<9-17,CASTLE>You picked it up.

226
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,520
<9-18,BECKETT>-是蕾妮啊  -蕾妮
<9-18,BECKETT>- Oh, Lanie. Yes. - Lanie!

227
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:23,380
<9-18,BECKETT>好  我马上过去
<9-18,BECKETT>Okay. I'll be right there.

228
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,400
<10-1,LANIE>进一步检查过尸体后
<10-1,LANIE>On closer examination of the body,

229
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,200
<10-1,LANIE>我在被害人的左手手腕处
<10-1,LANIE>I found multiple stress fractures here

230
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,500
<10-1,LANIE>发现了多处撕裂
<10-1,LANIE>on the victim's left wrist.

231
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,390
<10-2,BECKETT>怎么弄的
<10-2,BECKETT>From what?

232
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:36,370
<10-3,LANIE>撕裂伤有屈曲性损伤  拉伤
<10-3,LANIE>Well, they're consistent with flexion, extension,

233
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,750
<10-3,LANIE>过伸性损伤
<10-3,LANIE>and hyperextension,

234
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,290
<10-3,LANIE>就像一个左撇子
<10-3,LANIE>as a left-handed person would experience if --

235
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:43,350
<10-4,BECKETT>拿着台球杆  破坏周围的一切时弄的
<10-4,BECKETT>They grabbed a pool cue - and smashed everything to bits.

236
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,980
<10-4,BECKETT>说明威尔是左撇子
<10-4,BECKETT>So, Will's left handed.

237
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:48,090
<10-4,BECKETT>你是说毁掉他公寓的人是他自己吗
<10-4,BECKETT>Are you saying that will destroyed his own apartment?

238
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,210
<10-4,BECKETT>盲目地挥舞台球杆来保护自己
<10-4,BECKETT>Swinging a pool cue blindly to defend himself?

239
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:55,670
<11-1,CASTLE>我告诉你  这完全合理
<11-1,CASTLE>Telling you, it makes perfect sense.

240
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:57,080
<11-1,CASTLE>要是你在被隐形的恶魔攻击
<11-1,CASTLE>What would you do if you were attacked

241
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,860
<11-1,CASTLE>你会怎么办
<11-1,CASTLE>by an invisible demonic force?

242
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,570
<11-2,BECKETT>我会让莱恩中午别吃加豆墨西哥卷了
<11-2,BECKETT>I'd tell Ryan to lay off the bean burritos at lunch.

243
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,450
<11-3,RYAN>两位
<11-3,RYAN>Hey, guys.

244
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:05,050
<11-4,BECKETT>莱恩
<11-4,BECKETT>Hey, Ryan.

245
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:06,030
<11-5,RYAN>你是对的
<11-5,RYAN>So, you were right.

246
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:08,300
<11-5,RYAN>威尔的麻烦  可能真的是在
<11-5,RYAN>Will's troubles may have followed him home

247
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,340
<11-5,RYAN>奥尼尔台球厅惹上的
<11-5,RYAN>from O'Neill's pool hall.

248
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,310
<11-5,RYAN>我询问了多个目击者
<11-5,RYAN>I spoke with several witnesses who said

249
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,760
<11-5,RYAN>他上星期在那里跟一个叫吉格·麦克斯的
<11-5,RYAN>that he got into an altercation there last week

250
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,290
<11-5,RYAN>释放犯发生过争执
<11-5,RYAN>with an ex-con named Jiggy Michaels.

251
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:17,670
<11-6,BECKETT>争执有多严重
<11-6,BECKETT>How serious was the altercation?

252
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,270
<11-7,RYAN>吉格砸碎了一个啤酒瓶  威胁要杀了他
<11-7,RYAN>Well, Jiggy smashed a beer bottle, threatened to kill him.

253
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:21,640
<11-7,RYAN>好几个人不得不拦住他
<11-7,RYAN>Several people had to hold him back.

254
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,660
<11-8,CASTLE>这算得上严重了
<11-8,CASTLE>That qualifies as serious.

255
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,510
<11-9,RYAN>威尔赢了他两万块钱
<11-9,RYAN>Apparently, Will hustled him out of 20 grand.

256
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,830
<11-10,BECKETT>我们在他家就发现了这么多钱
<11-10,BECKETT>That's the exact same amount of money we found at his apartment.

257
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:31,650
<11-11,RYAN>而且  吉格有很多前科  包括多次强行闯入
<11-11,RYAN>Plus, Jiggy has over a dozen priors, including multiple B&Es.

258
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,270
<11-12,BECKETT>他能毫无声息地出入别人家
<11-12,BECKETT>He can get in and out undetected.

259
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:34,720
<11-11,RYAN>大家管他叫"幽灵"
<11-11,RYAN>They call him the Ghost.

260
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,430
<11-12,BECKETT>一个真实存在的杀手能够毫无声息地出入
<11-12,BECKETT>A real-world killer who can get in and out undetected.

261
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,850
<11-12,BECKETT>这才是个完美的解释
<11-12,BECKETT>Now, that makes perfect sense.

262
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:41,950
<12-1,JIGGY MICHAELS>我要律师
<12-1,JIGGY MICHAELS>I want a lawyer.

263
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,330
<12-2,JIGGY>我不是第一次进来了
<12-2,JIGGY>This ain't my first rodeo.

264
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,310
<12-3,RYAN>很不幸
<12-3,RYAN>Well, that is too bad,

265
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:49,090
<12-3,RYAN>因为律师会让你什么都不要说
<12-3,RYAN>because a lawyer is gonna tell you not to talk.

266
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:51,140
<12-4,ESPOSITO>可这样的话  你怎么跟大陪审团解释
<12-4,ESPOSITO>And how are you gonna explain to a grand jury

267
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:53,730
<12-4,ESPOSITO>那个你威胁过的  曾经赢了你钱的人
<12-4,ESPOSITO>that you threatened to kill a guy who hustled you,

268
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:55,930
<12-4,ESPOSITO>三天后  竟然被杀死了
<12-4,ESPOSITO>and then, three days later, he ended up dead?

269
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:58,430
<12-5,RYAN>作为多个犯罪组织的窃贼
<12-5,RYAN>As a second-story man for several crime outfits,

270
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:00,340
<12-5,RYAN>你知道怎么闯入法维克的家
<12-5,RYAN>you knew how to break into Fairwick's place,

271
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,360
<12-5,RYAN>但是当你找不到钱时
<12-5,RYAN>but when you couldn't find your money,

272
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,090
<12-5,RYAN>就决心要报复了
<12-5,RYAN>you settled on revenge instead.

273
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:06,080
<12-6,ESPOSITO>我们找到了一张出租车小票
<12-6,ESPOSITO>We've got a taxi receipt

274
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,230
<12-6,ESPOSITO>显示你昨晚去了切尔西
<12-6,ESPOSITO>dropping you off at Chelsea last night,

275
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:10,090
<12-6,ESPOSITO>离威尔的家只有三个街区
<12-6,ESPOSITO>three blocks from Will's apartment.

276
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:13,570
<12-6,ESPOSITO>那里距你在赛普里斯山的家相当得远  吉格
<12-6,ESPOSITO>That's a long way from your place in Cypress Hills, Jiggy.

277
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:17,470
<12-7,JIGGY>我的男朋友住在切尔西
<12-7,JIGGY>My boyfriend lives in Chelsea.

278
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:18,770
<12-7,JIGGY>我一整晚都跟他在一起
<12-7,JIGGY>I was with him all night.

279
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:21,100
<12-7,JIGGY>还有  威尔不是赢了我的钱  他作弊了
<12-7,JIGGY>And Will didn't hustle me. He cheated me.

280
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:23,990
<12-7,JIGGY>打到一半时  那混蛋跟我赌翻倍  赢家全拿
<12-7,JIGGY>Half a game in, that cujo bet me double or nothing

281
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,600
<12-7,JIGGY>然后一杆就全清了台上的球
<12-7,JIGGY>and cleared the rest of the table with a single shot.

282
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,720
<12-8,RYAN>你说什么呢
<12-8,RYAN>What are you talking about?

283
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:32,480
<12-9,JIGGY>那个母球就像着了魔了
<12-9,JIGGY>It was like that cue ball was possessed or something.

284
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:34,540
<13-1,JIGGY>没人能那么厉害  或者那么幸运
<13-1,JIGGY>No one is that good or that lucky,

285
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:37,050
<13-1,JIGGY>所以是的  我很生气  但我没有杀他
<13-1,JIGGY>So, yeah, I got pissed, but I didn't kill the guy.

286
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,390
<13-1,JIGGY>事实上  威尔第二天找到了我
<13-1,JIGGY>In fact, Will tracked me down the next day

287
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:40,890
<13-1,JIGGY>并提出要把钱还给我
<13-1,JIGGY>and offered to give the money back.

288
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:41,840
<14-1,ESPOSITO>是吗
<14-1,ESPOSITO>Really?

289
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:45,090
<14-2,JIGGY>他真的打算把两万块钱还给你
<14-2,JIGGY>He was just gonna pay you back $20,000,

290
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:46,580
<14-3,ESPOSITO>怎么  他突然良心发现
<14-3,ESPOSITO>What, out of the kindness of his heart?

291
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,030
<14-4,JIGGY>是用来换取消息的
<14-4,JIGGY>In exchange for some knowledge.

292
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,760
<14-5,RYAN>这消息可够贵的  你为他做了什么
<14-5,RYAN>That's some expensive knowledge. What did you do for him?

293
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,690
<14-6,JIGGY>什么也没做  我们只是聊了聊
<14-6,JIGGY>I didn't do anything. We just talked.

294
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:53,090
<14-7,ESPOSITO>那威尔想知道什么
<14-7,ESPOSITO>So, what did Will want to know?

295
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:57,210
<14-8,JIGGY>他想让我去踩点上东区一户有钱人家
<14-8,JIGGY>He wanted me to case a brownstone on the Upper East Side.

296
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:58,740
<14-9,RYAN>这不光是聊聊这么简单
<14-9,RYAN>That sounds like more than talking.

297
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,300
<14-10,JIGGY>我已经不干那一行了
<14-10,JIGGY>I don't do that stuff anymore.

298
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,300
<14-10,JIGGY>威尔只是想问问他怎么能进去
<14-10,JIGGY>Will just asked how he could break in himself.

299
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,470
<14-11,ESPOSITO>为什么  那户人家有什么特别的
<14-11,ESPOSITO>Why? What was so special about that brownstone?

300
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,380
<14-12,JIGGY>我不知道  但想进去绝非易事
<14-12,JIGGY>I don't know, but it wasn't gonna be easy.

301
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:10,260
<14-12,JIGGY>那户人家也有准备
<14-12,JIGGY>I mean, place had the works --

302
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:13,450
<14-12,JIGGY>运动检测器  压力和热量传感器
<14-12,JIGGY>motion detectors, pressure and thermal sensors.

303
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,760
<14-12,JIGGY>想要进去简直就是疯了
<14-12,JIGGY>You'd have to be nuts to try to go in there.

304
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:18,520
<14-13,ESPOSITO>你看这样好不好  我们当没听见
<14-13,ESPOSITO>What do you say that we forget

305
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,630
<14-13,ESPOSITO>你给他传授闯入人家的"秘籍"
<14-13,ESPOSITO>that you were acting like the Wikipedia of B&Es?

306
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,930
<14-14,RYAN>但你要把那户人家的地址告诉我们
<14-14,RYAN>And you give us the address of that brownstone.

307
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:30,140
<15-1,BECKETT>在这周早些时候  七十大街东39号
<15-1,BECKETT>There was a break-in at 39 East 70th Street

308
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,500
<15-1,BECKETT>确实发生过一起入室盗窃
<15-1,BECKETT>earlier this week,

309
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,970
<15-1,BECKETT>户主汤姆·塔尔梅奇受到了袭击
<15-1,BECKETT>and the owner, Tom Talmadge, was assaulted.

310
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:35,260
<15-1,BECKETT>汤姆·塔尔梅奇
<15-1,BECKETT>Tom Talmadge?

311
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,260
<15-2,CASTLE>他是这个拼车服务Hytch的创始人
<15-2,CASTLE>He's the founder of that ride-share service, Hytch.

312
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:40,390
<15-3,ESPOSITO>车顶上有大拇指的那种车
<15-3,ESPOSITO>The stupid cars with the thumbs on the roof?

313
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:42,680
<15-4,CASTLE>随你怎么嘲笑  这个应用让他成了亿万富翁
<15-4,CASTLE>Laugh all you want. That app made him a billionaire.

314
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,030
<15-5,RYAN>威尔闯入亿万富翁的家干什么
<15-5,RYAN>What's Will doing breaking into a billionaire's house?

315
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,950
<15-6,BECKETT>不知道  但有件事很奇怪
<15-6,BECKETT>I don't know, but here's the weird thing.

316
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,450
<15-6,BECKETT>汤姆进了医院  但他拒绝
<15-6,BECKETT>Tom was hospitalized and he refused

317
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:50,970
<15-6,BECKETT>告诉警察袭击者的容貌
<15-6,BECKETT>to give a description of the attacker.

318
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:54,100
<15-7,CASTLE>这和威尔几天后被杀绝不是巧合
<15-7,CASTLE>Can't be a coincidence that Will shows up dead a few days later.

319
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,640
<15-8,BECKETT>不是  他在隐瞒什么
<15-8,BECKETT>No. He's hiding something.

320
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,710
<16-1,TOM TALMADGE>我已经跟别的警察说了
<16-1,TOM TALMADGE>I already told the other cops --

321
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:00,180
<16-1,TOM TALMADGE>我不想录口供
<16-1,TOM TALMADGE>I don't want to give a statement.

322
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,460
<16-2,BECKETT>塔尔梅奇先生
<16-2,BECKETT>Mr. Talmadge,

323
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:03,530
<16-2,BECKETT>你跟威廉·法维克是什么关系
<16-2,BECKETT>What's your relationship to William Fairwick?

324
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:04,980
<16-3,TOM>我不知道他是谁
<16-3,TOM>I don't know who that is.

325
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:11,210
<16-4,BECKETT>塔尔梅奇先生  你的反应出卖了你
<16-4,BECKETT>Mr. Talmadge, your reaction says otherwise.

326
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:12,630
<16-4,BECKETT>是他袭击的你吗
<16-4,BECKETT>Was he your attacker?

327
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,580
<16-5,TOM>我不要录口供
<16-5,TOM>I'm not giving a statement.

328
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,300
<16-6,CASTLE>鉴于法维克先生被杀了
<16-6,CASTLE>Given that Mr. Fairwick was murdered,

329
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,200
<16-6,CASTLE>你最好还是再考虑一下
<16-6,CASTLE>you might want to rethink that.

330
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,220
<16-7,TOM>被杀了
<16-7,TOM>Murdered?

331
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:23,840
<16-8,TOM>如果你们是觉得我跟这件事有什么关系
<16-8,TOM>Look, if you're implying that I had something to do with it --

332
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,290
<16-9,BECKETT>那你为什么拒绝回答问题
<16-9,BECKETT>Well, why else would you refuse to answer the question?

333
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:27,940
<16-10,TOM>因为你们肯定不会相信我
<16-10,TOM>Because you won't believe me anyway.

334
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,320
<16-10,TOM>听起来太离谱了
<16-10,TOM>It'll sound crazy.

335
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,600
<16-11,CASTLE>离谱的事我们见得多了
<16-11,CASTLE>You wouldn't believe the crazy things we've heard.

336
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:35,270
<16-11,CASTLE>说说吧
<16-11,CASTLE>Try us.

337
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:42,540
<16-12,TOM>那天我早回家了  开了瓶啤酒
<16-12,TOM>I'd gotten home early, cracked a beer,

338
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,410
<16-12,TOM>但是在我坐下前
<16-12,TOM>but before I could settle in,

339
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:47,720
<16-12,TOM>我有种感觉  像是有人在盯着我
<16-12,TOM>I had this feeling like I was being watched.

340
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,950
<16-12,TOM>然后  突然之间
<16-12,TOM>Then out of nowhere,

341
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:51,440
<16-12,TOM>有东西把我砸倒在地
<16-12,TOM>something threw me to the ground.

342
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,690
<16-12,TOM>等一下  有东西
<16-12,TOM>Wait. Some thing?

343
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:54,610
<16-13,BECKETT>你是说他吧
<16-13,BECKETT>You mean him, right?

344
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:57,250
<16-13,BECKETT>不  我是指某个东西
<16-13,BECKETT>No. I mean some thing.

345
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:58,750
<16-14,TOM>某种力量
<16-14,TOM>Some force.

346
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:01,790
<16-14,TOM>我能感觉到它压在我身上  让我窒息
<16-14,TOM>I could feel it on top of me, suffocating me,

347
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:03,960
<16-14,TOM>但是  但是又什么也没有
<16-14,TOM>But -- but there was nothing there.

348
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,780
<16-14,TOM>我一定是晕过去了一段时间
<16-14,TOM>I must've blacked out for a second,

349
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:07,880
<16-14,TOM>等我醒来时
<16-14,TOM>And when I came to,

350
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:11,670
<16-14,TOM>那个人站在我面前  喊着"住手
<16-14,TOM>that guy was standing over me, screaming, "Stop it.

351
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:13,620
<16-14,TOM>你要弄死他了  我们的计划不是这样的"
<16-14,TOM>You're killing him. This wasn't the deal."

352
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,890
<16-15,BECKETT>-他在跟谁喊  -我不知道
<16-15,BECKETT>- And who was he yelling at? - I don't know.

353
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,560
<16-16,TOM>那里没有别人了
<16-16,TOM>There wasn't anybody else there.

354
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,840
<16-16,TOM>但我觉得这个人  他救了我一命
<16-16,TOM>But I think that guy, he saved my life.

355
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:24,550
<16-17,CASTLE>这个所谓的力量  它想要什么
<16-17,CASTLE>This force, what did it want?

356
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:29,660
<16-18,TOM>似乎  它是想要我
<16-18,TOM>It just seemed like it wanted... me.

358
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,240
<17-1,BECKETT>好吧
<17-1,BECKETT>Okay. Fine.

359
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,080
<17-1,BECKETT>我承认这很诡异
<17-1,BECKETT>I admit it is weird.

360
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,590
<17-1,BECKETT>但我敢肯定
<17-1,BECKETT>But I can tell you this.

361
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:52,020
<17-1,BECKETT>无论塔尔梅奇看到或没看到的是什么
<17-1,BECKETT>Whatever Talmadge saw or didn't see,

362
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:52,750
<17-1,BECKETT>那绝不是魔鬼
<17-1,BECKETT>it wasn't the devil.

363
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:55,870
<17-2,CASTLE>你说得对  可能是它的一个小鬼
<17-2,CASTLE>You're right. Probably one of his minions.

364
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:58,470
<17-2,CASTLE>魔鬼派这个低级小鬼
<17-2,CASTLE>A lowly demon that will summoned from beelzebub

365
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:00,840
<17-2,CASTLE>去帮它从塔尔梅奇那里弄到它想要的东西
<17-2,CASTLE>to help him get whatever it was he wanted from Talmadge.

366
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,020
<17-3,BECKETT>魔鬼是不需要帮助就能通过安保系统的
<17-3,BECKETT>Demons don't need help - getting past security systems,

367
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,960
<17-3,BECKETT>也用不着走门
<17-3,BECKETT>and the devil doesn't need to use the door.

368
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,530
<17-4,BECKETT>我会再看一遍威尔公寓的
<17-4,BECKETT>I'm gonna take another look at that security-cam footage

369
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:08,830
<17-4,BECKETT>监控录像
<17-4,BECKETT>from Will's apartment.

370
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:14,720
<18-1,BECKETT>那光碟哪去了
<18-1,BECKETT>Where's the DVD?

371
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:15,690
<18-2,OFFICER>什么光碟
<18-2,OFFICER>What DVD?

372
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:19,080
<18-3,BECKETT>我把监控录像的光碟放在这个证据箱里了
<18-3,BECKETT>I put a DVD of security footage in this evidence box.

373
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:19,740
<18-3,BECKETT>哪去了
<18-3,BECKETT>Where is it?

374
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,460
<18-4,OFFICER>不在的话  就是你没放进来
<18-4,OFFICER>Ain't in there, you didn't put it in there.

375
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,800
<18-5,BECKETT>我没放进来才怪
<18-5,BECKETT>The hell I didn't.

376
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,040
<18-5,BECKETT>前两个小时谁来过
<18-5,BECKETT>Who's been in here the past two hours?

377
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,690
<18-6,OFFICER>探长  从你今天早上查看这个箱子之后
<18-6,OFFICER>Detective, no one's been in or out of this room

378
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,610
<18-6,OFFICER>就没有人进出过这里
<18-6,OFFICER>since you checked that box in this morning.

379
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:29,880
<18-6,OFFICER>那光碟怎么没了呢
<18-6,OFFICER>So, what did it do?

380
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:32,780
<18-7,BECKETT>自己走出去了吗
<18-7,BECKETT>Just walk out on its own?

381
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:33,850
<18-7,BECKETT>不是
<18-7,BECKETT>No.

382
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:35,690
<18-7,BECKETT>它不是自己走出去的
<18-7,BECKETT>It didn't walk out on its own.

383
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:37,070
<18-8,CASTLE>贝克特  你说得对
<18-8,CASTLE>Beckett, you were right.

384
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,100
<18-8,CASTLE>凶手不是什么恶魔
<18-8,CASTLE>Killer isn't the devil.

385
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,250
<18-8,CASTLE>恶魔用不着销毁证据
<18-8,CASTLE>The devil doesn't need to dispose of evidence.

386
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:40,980
<18-9,BECKETT>很明显
<18-9,BECKETT>Clearly.

387
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,250
<18-10,CASTLE>明显这个词用得真是恰当
<18-10,CASTLE>"Clearly" is the perfect word,

388
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:46,380
<18-10,CASTLE>因为很明显  我们要找的凶手是隐形人
<18-10,CASTLE>Because clearly, our killer is the invisible man.

389
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,110
<19-1,CASTLE>你毁了咖啡的奶泡
<19-1,CASTLE>You collapsed the foam.

390
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:57,800
<19-2,BECKETT>我给威尔的公寓打电话
<19-2,BECKETT>So, I called Will's place

391
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,320
<19-2,BECKETT>想再把监控的录像调出来
<19-2,BECKETT>to pull security-cam footage from the hallway again,

392
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,570
<19-2,BECKETT>可是所有的文件都被清除了
<19-2,BECKETT>and all the files have been erased.

393
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:05,860
<19-2,BECKETT>门卫确定纽约警局离开犯罪现场后
<19-2,BECKETT>The doorman swears that no one has been in the security room

394
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,950
<19-2,BECKETT>没有人到过安保室
<19-2,BECKETT>since NYPD left the crime scene.

395
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:10,370
<19-3,CASTLE>没有人  还是有某个他看不到的人
<19-3,CASTLE>No one - or someone he couldn't see?

396
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,430
<19-3,CASTLE>贝克特  这个推论符合全部事实
<19-3,CASTLE>Beckett, it fits all the facts.

397
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,740
<19-3,CASTLE>塔尔梅奇被一股无形的力量袭击
<19-3,CASTLE>The attack on Talmadge by an unseen force,

398
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,680
<19-3,CASTLE>丢失的证据
<19-3,CASTLE>the missing evidence,

399
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,480
<19-3,CASTLE>诡异的白色撞球  甚至威尔的凶杀案
<19-3,CASTLE>the haunted cue ball, even Will's murder.

400
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,430
<19-4,BECKETT>卡塞尔  打住
<19-4,BECKETT>Castle, stop.

401
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:20,960
<19-4,BECKETT>这个世上没有什么隐形人
<19-4,BECKETT>There is no such thing as the invisible man.

402
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,630
<19-4,BECKETT>但肯定有蹊跷  而威尔是其中的关键
<19-4,BECKETT>But something is going on, and Will is at the center of it.

403
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:25,110
<19-4,BECKETT>埃斯波
<19-4,BECKETT>Hey, Espo.

404
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:27,350
<19-6,BECKETT>威尔·法维克身上还有什么发现
<19-6,BECKETT>What else have we found on Will Fairwick?

405
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,920
<19-7,ESPOSITO>莱恩还在联系
<19-7,ESPOSITO>Well, Ryan's still trying to get in touch

406
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:30,850
<19-7,ESPOSITO>他的公司  格林布拉特保险公司
<19-7,ESPOSITO>with his employer, Greenblatt Insurance,

407
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:33,220
<19-7,ESPOSITO>托瑞正在里面破解他的电子设备
<19-7,ESPOSITO>and Tory's in there trying to crack his electronics.

408
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,660
<19-7,ESPOSITO>显然威尔在硬件的加密很厉害
<19-7,ESPOSITO>Apparently, Will had some heavy encryption on his hardware.

409
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,150
<19-8,CASTLE>对于一个在保险业工作的人来说
<19-8,CASTLE>That seems a little unnecessary

410
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,790
<19-8,CASTLE>这么严的加密有点没必要
<19-8,CASTLE>for someone in the insurance industry.

411
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:41,400
<19-9,ESPOSITO>我刚从他的无线运营商那
<19-9,ESPOSITO>Yeah, but I just got his phone records

412
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:42,480
<19-9,ESPOSITO>拿到了他的电话记录
<19-9,ESPOSITO>from his wireless carrier,

413
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:43,790
<19-9,ESPOSITO>这家伙不怎么打电话
<19-9,ESPOSITO>And dude didn't talk much

414
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:45,900
<19-9,ESPOSITO>除了这里的这个号码
<19-9,ESPOSITO>except to this one number right here.

415
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:48,390
<19-9,ESPOSITO>过去的六周里他给这号码打了几十通电话
<19-9,ESPOSITO>He traded dozens of calls with it over the past six weeks,

416
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:50,050
<19-9,ESPOSITO>在此之前他从没有联系过这个号码
<19-9,ESPOSITO>and he didn't ever call it before then.

417
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,800
<19-10,CASTLE>看上去他们几乎每天都要通话
<19-10,CASTLE>Looks like they spoke nearly every day.

418
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,880
<19-11,BECKETT>这号码是谁的
<19-11,BECKETT>Who owns that number?

419
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,410
<19-12,ESPOSITO>是一位名叫多娜·布鲁克斯的女士注册的
<19-12,ESPOSITO>It's registered to a Ms. Donna Brooks.

420
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:58,350
<19-12,ESPOSITO>这显示她是哈德逊大学的海洋生物学教授
<19-12,ESPOSITO>Says here that she's a marine biology professor at Hudson U.

421
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,990
<19-13,BECKETT>他在做什么  要和生物教授联系
<19-13,BECKETT>What's he doing - talking to a biology professor?

422
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:04,590
<20-1,DONNA BROOKS>我好几天都没有他的消息了
<20-1,DONNA BROOKS>I hadn't heard from him in a few days.

423
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:07,740
<20-1,DONNA BROOKS>我很担心  但我没想过事情会是这样
<20-1,DONNA BROOKS>I was worried, but I never imagined this.

424
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,200
<20-1,DONNA BROOKS>我不敢相信他已经死了
<20-1,DONNA BROOKS>I can't believe he's dead.

425
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:13,930
<20-2,BECKETT>多娜我知道很难接受  但你怎么认识威尔的
<20-2,BECKETT>Donna, I know this is hard, but how do you know Will?

426
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,910
<20-3,DONNA>我想你可以说我们在约会
<20-3,DONNA>Um, I guess you could say we were dating.

427
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:21,170
<20-3,DONNA>他几个月前在脸书上联系我
<20-3,DONNA>He reached out on facebook a couple months ago.

428
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:25,730
<20-3,DONNA>自从在麻省理工约过会后我就没见过他
<20-3,DONNA>I hadn't seen him since we first dated back at M.I.T.

429
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:29,320
<20-4,CASTLE>支持无政府主义的桌球老手上过麻省理工
<20-4,CASTLE>An anarchist pool shark attended M.I.T.?

430
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,440
<20-5,DONNA>他一直都很叛逆
<20-5,DONNA>He was always a rebel,

431
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:34,100
<20-5,DONNA>也是我们班上最聪明的学生
<20-5,DONNA>and the smartest student in our class.

432
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,700
<20-6,BECKETT>他为什么要再和你联系
<20-6,BECKETT>Why did he get back in touch?

433
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,320
<20-7,DONNA>威尔只上了一个学期就退学了
<20-7,DONNA>Will dropped out after only a semester.

434
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:40,790
<20-7,DONNA>他想找我谈谈完成学位的事情
<20-7,DONNA>So he wanted to talk about finishing his degree,

435
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:42,650
<20-7,DONNA>在哈德逊上学
<20-7,DONNA>enrolling here at Hudson.

436
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,940
<20-7,DONNA>过了这么久
<20-7,DONNA>It was crazy after all that time,

437
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:47,190
<20-7,DONNA>我们之间还能擦出火花真是太不可思议了
<20-7,DONNA>the spark was still there between us.

438
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,050
<20-8,DONNA>不好意思
<20-8,DONNA>Excuse me.

439
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:54,140
<20-8,DONNA>墨鱼不喜欢这样
<20-8,DONNA>Cuttlefish don't like that.

440
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,310
<20-9,CASTLE>好吧
<20-9,CASTLE>Right.

441
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,570
<20-10,BECKETT>他有没有提过汤姆·塔尔梅奇这个名字
<20-10,BECKETT>Did he ever mention the name Tom Talmadge?

442
00:17:57,570 --> 00:17:59,480
<20-11,DONNA>没有  我印象中没有
<20-11,DONNA>Uh, no. Not that I remember.

443
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,590
<20-12,BECKETT>威尔的生活中
<20-12,BECKETT>And was there anything out of the ordinary

444
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:02,770
<20-12,BECKETT>有没有什么不寻常的地方
<20-12,BECKETT>going on in Will's life?

445
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:05,720
<20-13,CASTLE>比如超出常理很多很多的东西
<20-13,CASTLE>Like way, way, way out of the ordinary.

446
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,810
<20-14,DONNA>有
<20-14,DONNA>Yeah. There was.

447
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:10,600
<20-14,DONNA>从上周开始威尔变得有些多疑
<20-14,DONNA>Will started acting paranoid last week.

448
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:11,370
<20-14,DONNA>我们去吃饭的时候
<20-14,DONNA>We went to dinner,

449
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:14,170
<20-14,DONNA>他只愿意坐在正对门口的位置
<20-14,DONNA>and he would only take a table facing the door.

450
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,900
<20-14,DONNA>他觉得自己被人监视了
<20-14,DONNA>He said he thought he was being watched.

451
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:17,790
<20-15,BECKETT>被谁
<20-15,BECKETT>By who?

452
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:19,770
<20-16,DONNA>他只是说  他们
<20-16,DONNA>He would only say by "Them."

453
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:21,140
<20-16,DONNA>我以为这都是他乱想出来的
<20-16,DONNA>I thought he was imagining it.

454
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,550
<20-16,DONNA>我跟他说他需要帮助
<20-16,DONNA>I told him he needed to get help

455
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:24,600
<20-16,DONNA>才不至于让麻省理工的事情再次发生
<20-16,DONNA>so it didn't become M.I.T. all over again.

456
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,130
<20-17,CASTLE>在麻省理工的时候发生了什么
<20-17,CASTLE>What happened at M.I.T.?

457
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,700
<20-18,DONNA>大一的时候  威尔崩溃了
<20-18,DONNA>Freshman year, Will had a breakdown.

458
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,870
<20-18,DONNA>在很大的压力下他承受不住了
<20-18,DONNA>He cracked under the pressure.

459
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:33,590
<20-18,DONNA>所以他才离开了
<20-18,DONNA>That's why he left.

460
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:34,960
<20-18,DONNA>但如果他是被杀的
<20-18,DONNA>But if somebody killed him,

461
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:37,940
<20-18,DONNA>那有可能他真是被人跟踪了
<20-18,DONNA>then maybe he was being followed.

462
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,870
<21-1,BECKETT>也可以这么想
<21-1,BECKETT>Okay, here's a theory.

463
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,170
<21-1,BECKETT>万一是威尔又一次崩溃了呢
<21-1,BECKETT>What if will had another breakdown?

464
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:43,380
<21-1,BECKETT>万一是他臆想出来恶魔要来找他
<21-1,BECKETT>What if he imagined that the devil was after him,

465
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:46,540
<21-1,BECKETT>在他的妄想中自己把公寓毁掉了
<21-1,BECKETT>and in his delusional state, he smashed up his apartment

466
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,780
<21-1,BECKETT>然后把自己钉死了呢
<21-1,BECKETT>and impaled himself?

467
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:50,230
<21-1,BECKETT>吃了迷幻药的人做过比这还糟的事
<21-1,BECKETT>I mean, we've seen guys on pcp do much worse.

468
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,150
<21-2,CASTLE>但还是不能解释塔尔梅奇遭受的袭击
<21-2,CASTLE>Well, that still doesn't explain the attack on Talmadge,

469
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:54,800
<21-2,CASTLE>奇特一杆清台  还有消失的证据
<21-2,CASTLE>The magical pool shot, or all the disappearing evidence.

470
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,630
<21-2,CASTLE>不  事情要比这严重
<21-2,CASTLE>No, something much bigger is going on here.

471
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:58,260
<21-3,RYAN>你知道吗  我觉得卡塞尔是对的
<21-3,RYAN>You know, I think Castle may be right.

472
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,070
<21-3,RYAN>我终于联系上了格林布拉特保险公司
<21-3,RYAN>I finally got in touch with Greenblatt Insurance.

473
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:03,050
<21-3,RYAN>他们说他是在职员工  但是是远程员工
<21-3,RYAN>They say he is on the payroll, but as a remote employee.

474
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:04,840
<21-3,RYAN>格林布拉特唯一的办公室在芝加哥
<21-3,RYAN>Greenblatt's only office is in Chicago,

475
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,880
<21-3,RYAN>威尔从来都没去过那
<21-3,RYAN>and Will's never been there.

476
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,770
<21-4,CASTLE>但是他的邻居说他看见威尔每天都去工作
<21-4,CASTLE>But his neighbor said he saw him go into work every day.

477
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:09,040
<21-5,RYAN>而且他的工作出入证
<21-5,RYAN>Yep, and his Greenblatt key card

478
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,120
<21-5,RYAN>跟钥匙挂在一起  有很多刮痕  都磨旧了
<21-5,RYAN>was with his house keys and all scratched up, worn.

479
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,050
<21-6,CASTLE>如果格林布拉特在纽约没有办事处
<21-6,CASTLE>So, if Greenblatt doesn't have a New York office,

480
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:14,450
<21-6,CASTLE>那威尔每天都去了哪里呢
<21-6,CASTLE>where was Will going every day?

481
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:16,730
<21-7,BECKETT>听上去格林布拉特保险公司是个幌子
<21-7,BECKETT>Sounds like Greenblatt Insurance is a front.

482
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,700
<21-7,BECKETT>莱恩  这张门卡现在在哪里
<21-7,BECKETT>Ryan, where is this key card now?

483
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:19,990
<21-8,RYAN>还在威尔的公寓里
<21-8,RYAN>Back at Will's apartment.

484
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:27,230
<22-1,BECKETT>你这是在干什么
<22-1,BECKETT>What are you doing?

485
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:30,710
<22-2,CASTLE>我们不知道隐形人现在是不是也在这里
<22-2,CASTLE>We don't know if the invisible man is here right now.

486
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,010
<22-3,CASTLE>那个隐形人是不是捏你屁股了
<22-3,CASTLE>Did the invisible man just goose you?

487
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,190
<22-4,BECKETT>-卡塞尔  -我知道
<22-4,BECKETT>- Castle. - I know.

488
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:44,850
<22-5,CASTLE>他们就是这样的人  太没礼貌了
<22-5,CASTLE>They're like that. So gauche.

489
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:47,750
<22-5,CASTLE>格林布拉特保险公司
<22-5,CASTLE>威廉·法维克

490
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,310
<22-6,CASTLE>好了
<22-6,CASTLE>Right.

491
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,030
<22-7,CASTLE>演得真像
<22-7,CASTLE>That's pretty good.

492
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:58,040
<22-7,CASTLE>隐形的部分被你诠释得...
<22-7,CASTLE>You're really selling the invisible ...

493
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,210
<22-8,CASTLE>这是  这是真的
<22-8,CASTLE>This is -- this is real!

494
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,260
<22-9,CASTLE>我碰到了  不论那是什么  我碰到了
<22-9,CASTLE>I touched it. Whatever it was, I touched it!

495
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:12,750
<22-10,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<22-10,BECKETT>Castle!

496
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:14,660
<22-11,CASTLE>他是来抢门卡的
<22-11,CASTLE>He's going after the key card!

497
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:23,940
<22-13,BECKETT>你还好吗
<22-13,BECKETT>Are you okay?

498
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:28,560
<22-14,BECKETT>刚才到底是什么
<22-14,BECKETT>What was that?

499
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:30,180
<22-15,CASTLE>就是他
<22-15,CASTLE>That was him.

500
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:34,080
<22-15,CASTLE>隐形人真的存在
<22-15,CASTLE>The invisible man is real!

501
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:35,890
<22-15,CASTLE>是的
<22-15,CASTLE>Yeah.

502
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:40,680
<22-16,BECKETT>不论那个  不论那个是什么
<22-16,BECKETT>Well, whatever it...That -- whatever it was,

503
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:45,130
<22-16,BECKETT>他带着我们唯一的线索跑掉了
<22-16,BECKETT>It just ran off - with the only lead we have.

504
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:45,900
<22-16,BECKETT>没有
<22-16,BECKETT>No.

505
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,000
<22-17,CASTLE>他带走的是我的信用卡
<22-17,CASTLE>It ran off with my credit card.

506
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,970
<22-17,CASTLE>我拼死保住了这张门卡
<22-17,CASTLE>I managed to hang on to the key card.

507
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,620
<22-18,CASTLE>你不会觉得他还在这里吧
<22-18,CASTLE>You don't think - he's still here, do you?

508
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:05,630
<23-1,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>你们在封锁的犯罪现场被袭击了  被谁
<23-1,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>You were attacked at a closed crime scene? By whom?

509
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:07,470
<23-2,BECKETT>我们没能看清楚袭击者的长相  长官
<23-2,BECKETT>We didn't get a good look at the assailant, sir.

510
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,960
<23-3,CASTLE>其实  我们
<23-3,CASTLE>Actually, we --

511
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,420
<23-4,GATES>怎么了  卡塞尔先生
<23-4,GATES>Yes, Mr. Castle?

512
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:15,120
<23-5,CASTLE>当时很黑  我们什么都没看见
<23-5,CASTLE>It was dark and we didn't see anything.

513
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:17,500
<23-6,GATES>你们知道为什么那人会在那里吗
<23-6,GATES>Do you know why this person was there?

514
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,590
<23-7,BECKETT>我们确信他们是想拿到被害者的门卡
<23-7,BECKETT>We believe they were after the victim's key card.

515
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:20,110
<23-7,BECKETT>为什么
<23-7,BECKETT>Why?

516
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:23,060
<23-8,GATES>他们是想介入威尔的某部分生活吗
<23-8,GATES>Were they trying to gain access to some part of Will's life?

517
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,480
<23-9,CASTLE>也许他们是想掩盖罪证
<23-9,CASTLE>Or maybe they were covering their tracks

518
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,810
<23-9,CASTLE>不想让我们知道那张卡能打开哪扇门
<23-9,CASTLE>and don't want us to know what door that card opens.

519
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:28,720
<23-10,BECKETT>我已经让鉴证科重新处理犯罪现场了
<23-10,BECKETT>I've got CSU reprocessing the crime scene.

520
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,590
<23-10,BECKETT>他们正在寻找新的指纹
<23-10,BECKETT>They're looking for new prints,

521
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:31,400
<23-10,BECKETT>托瑞会把那张门卡和安全系统
<23-10,BECKETT>and Tory's gonna try to match the key card

522
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,210
<23-10,BECKETT>进行匹配
<23-10,BECKETT>to, um, to security systems.

523
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:35,690
<23-10,BECKETT>她明早就会开工
<23-10,BECKETT>She's gonna start that first thing in the morning.

524
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:38,480
<23-11,GATES>好的  有新消息通知我
<23-11,GATES>All right. Um, keep me posted.

525
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,230
<23-12,GATES>你有什么事情没告诉我吗
<23-12,GATES>Is there something you're not telling me?

526
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:51,160
<23-13,BECKETT>没有  长官
<23-13,BECKETT>No, sir.

527
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,720
<24-1,CASTLE>贝克特探长
<24-1,CASTLE>Detective Beckett.

528
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:58,680
<24-1,CASTLE>对你的上级撒谎
<24-1,CASTLE>Lying to your superior?

529
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,290
<24-2,BECKETT>我说的是事实
<24-2,BECKETT>I told her the truth.

530
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:02,010
<24-2,BECKETT>我不知道是什么袭击了我俩
<24-2,BECKETT>I don't know what attacked us.

531
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,460
<24-2,BECKETT>我没说谎
<24-2,BECKETT>That was not a lie.

532
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,430
<24-3,CASTLE>忽略是无形的谎言
<24-3,CASTLE>Omission is the invisible lie.

533
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,630
<24-4,BECKETT>卡塞尔  别跟我说之前发生的事
<24-4,BECKETT>Castle, you can't tell me that what happened

534
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:08,350
<24-4,BECKETT>没有吓到你  哪怕一点点
<24-4,BECKETT>didn't freak you out just a little bit.

535
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:10,370
<24-4,BECKETT>-那到底是什么  -我不知道
<24-4,BECKETT>- I mean, what the hell was that thing? - I don't know.

536
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:14,580
<24-5,CASTLE>但我知道有个能放松一下的方法
<24-5,CASTLE>But I do know a way to take our minds off it for a while

537
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:15,740
<24-5,CASTLE>如果你
<24-5,CASTLE>if you're, uh...

538
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:17,890
<24-5,CASTLE>有兴趣的话
<24-5,CASTLE>Interested?

539
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,510
<25-1,CASTLE>你根本不知道我是有多想念这个
<25-1,CASTLE>You have no idea how much I missed this.

540
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,570
<25-2,BECKETT>你失去了两个月的记忆
<25-2,BECKETT>You had amnesia for two months.

541
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,710
<25-2,BECKETT>我更想念
<25-2,BECKETT>I missed it more.

542
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:48,860
<25-3,CASTLE>你听到了吗
<25-3,CASTLE>Did you hear that?

543
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:50,780
<25-4,BECKETT>别吓人了  卡塞尔
<25-4,BECKETT>Very funny, Castle.

544
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,720
<25-5,CASTLE>我认真的
<25-5,CASTLE>I'm serious.

545
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,720
<25-6,BECKETT>就是音乐声
<25-6,BECKETT>No, just hear the music.

546
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,450
<25-8,BECKETT>是你的手在我的腿上吗
<25-8,BECKETT>Is that your hand on my leg?

547
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,090
<25-9,CASTLE>是的
<25-9,CASTLE>Yeah.

548
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:06,570
<25-9,CASTLE>-绝对是  -好吧
<25-9,CASTLE>- Pretty sure. - Okay.

549
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:07,580
<25-11,CASTLE>来吧
<25-11,CASTLE>Okay.

550
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:09,710
<25-12,CASTLE>怎么了
<25-12,CASTLE>What's wrong?

551
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,740
<25-13,BECKETT>我觉得  我觉得们正在被人看着
<25-13,BECKETT>I just -- I feel like we're being watched.

552
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,840
<25-14,CASTLE>我很确定没人在看我们
<25-14,CASTLE>Pretty sure we're not being watched.

553
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,900
<25-15,BECKETT>我相信你  不过也许现在不适合干这个
<25-15,BECKETT>I know, but maybe this isn't such a good idea.

554
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:24,080
<25-16,CASTLE>在这儿等我
<25-16,CASTLE>Just wait here.

555
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,750
<25-16,CASTLE>好吧
<25-16,CASTLE>Okay.

556
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,990
<26-1,CASTLE>你还觉得参加僵尸末日生存训练营
<26-1,CASTLE>And you thought zombie apocalypse survival camp

557
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:42,900
<26-1,CASTLE>是浪费时间呢
<26-1,CASTLE>was a waste of time.

558
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:47,930
<26-2,CASTLE>很好  不错
<26-2,CASTLE>Good. Okay.

559
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:52,050
<26-3,CASTLE>怎么了
<26-3,CASTLE>What?

560
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:56,110
<26-4,BECKETT>你突然有种书呆子式的性感
<26-4,BECKETT>You just kind of make nerdy sexy.

561
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,100
<26-4,BECKETT>说的没错
<26-4,BECKETT>That's true.

562
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:58,770
<26-5,CASTLE>刚才到哪儿了
<26-5,CASTLE>Where were we?

563
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,530
<26-7,CASTLE>母亲
<26-7,CASTLE>Mother.

564
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:12,690
<26-8,BECKETT>玛莎
<26-8,BECKETT>Martha?

565
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:13,810
<26-9,MARTHA>非常抱歉
<26-9,MARTHA>I'm so sorry.

566
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:15,000
<26-9,MARTHA>我不知道你们在家
<26-9,MARTHA>I didn't know you guys were home.

567
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,770
<26-9,MARTHA>我就是想来拿点牙线
<26-9,MARTHA>I just wanted a little dental floss,

568
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:18,500
<26-9,MARTHA>看来我是找到了
<26-9,MARTHA>And it looks like I found it.

569
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:19,890
<26-10,MARTHA>我的天呐
<26-10,MARTHA>Oh, my lord.

570
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,640
<27-1,RYAN>鉴证科重新处理犯罪现场
<27-1,RYAN>So, CSU reprocessed that crime scene.

571
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:32,780
<27-1,RYAN>没发现新的指纹  这就说明
<27-1,RYAN>No new fingerprints, which means --

572
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,120
<27-2,ESPOSITO>拜托  隐形人
<27-2,ESPOSITO>Come on. The invisible man?

573
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:34,900
<27-2,ESPOSITO>我就这么说说
<27-2,ESPOSITO>I'm just saying,

574
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,740
<27-3,RYAN>贝克特昨晚都有点被吓到了
<27-3,RYAN>even Beckett seemed freaked out last night.

575
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,520
<27-4,ESPOSITO>如果可以隐形  还真挺酷的
<27-4,ESPOSITO>It would be cool, the power of invisibility.

576
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:42,890
<27-5,RYAN>我肯定会溜进51区的  你呢
<27-5,RYAN>I would so sneak into Area 51. You?

577
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,740
<27-6,ESPOSITO>超级碗  50码处
<27-6,ESPOSITO>Super bowl, 50-yard line.

578
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:47,250
<27-6,ESPOSITO>全场最佳的座...
<27-6,ESPOSITO>Best seat in the hou...

579
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:49,380
<27-7,ESPOSITO>你脖子上的是什么
<27-7,ESPOSITO>Hey, what's that on your neck?

580

605
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:48,450
<28-1,RYAN>不是开玩笑

00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,130
<28-1,RYAN>那工作比这危险多了
<28-1,RYAN>It's more dangerous than this job.

607
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:51,700
<28-1,RYAN>那些女人  疯狂地冲到台上
<28-1,RYAN>Those women, they rush the stage

608
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,470
<28-1,RYAN>就好像那些男人是地球上仅存的男性
<28-1,RYAN>like these are - the last men on the planet.

611
00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:01,140
<28-2,TORY>我从未见过类似这卡的无线射频识别构造
<28-2,TORY>The card's RFID architecture is like nothing I've ever seen.

612
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,150
<28-3,BECKETT>关于这卡
<28-3,BECKETT>Yeah, but there's got to be something else

613
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,400
<28-3,BECKETT>没什么别的线索吗
<28-3,BECKETT>that you can tell us about it.

614
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:05,620
<28-4,TORY>只能告诉你  这不是为了销售生产的
<28-4,TORY>I can tell you this -- it's not commercially manufactured.

615
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:07,050
<28-5,RYAN>那无政府主义男是怎么拿到它的
<28-5,RYAN>Well, how did anarchy boy get it, then?

616
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:09,140
<28-6,TORY>我不知道  恐怕没办法查出来
<28-6,TORY>I don't know, and I'm afraid there's no way to find out.

617
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:11,300
<28-6,TORY>这卡片的设计使它无迹可寻
<28-6,TORY>This thing was designed to be untraceable.

618
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:14,150
<28-7,BECKETT>也许卡片无迹可寻  但这个不一定
<28-7,BECKETT>Maybe the card was, but this wasn't.

619
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:18,630
<28-7,BECKETT>产自美国  亚特文提斯服饰公司出品
<28-7,BECKETT>Proudly made in the U.S.A. by Advantus Apparel.

620
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:23,660
<29-1,CASTLE>等等  要我赞助分局垒球队吗
<29-1,CASTLE>So, wait, I'm sponsoring the precinct softball team?

621
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:26,080
<29-2,BECKETT>是的  只有这样我才能让
<29-2,BECKETT>Yeah, it was the only way that I could get Advantus Apparel

622
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,760
<29-2,BECKETT>亚特文提斯服饰公司把客户名单给我们
<29-2,BECKETT>to share their client list with us.

623
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,960
<29-2,BECKETT>他们说四年前已把格林布拉特的订单
<29-2,BECKETT>Now, they said that they shipped the Greenblatt order

624
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,070
<29-2,BECKETT>送到这里了
<29-2,BECKETT>to this office four years ago.

625
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,710
<29-3,CASTLE>这里是什么地方
<29-3,CASTLE>What is this place?

626
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:38,700
<29-3,CASTLE>我不知道
<29-3,CASTLE>I don't know.

627
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,200
<29-4,BECKETT>整层楼都没有登记
<29-4,BECKETT>This whole floor is unlisted.

628
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:42,980
<29-5,CASTLE>我想这一定是个秘密实验室
<29-5,CASTLE>I think it's a secret laboratory

629
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,560
<29-5,CASTLE>他们把人类当做试验品
<29-5,CASTLE>where they're injecting human guinea pigs

630
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,180
<29-5,CASTLE>给他们注射隐形血清
<29-5,CASTLE>with invisibility serum.

631
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,480
<29-6,BECKETT>不管是什么
<29-6,BECKETT>Well, whatever it is,

632
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:50,580
<29-6,BECKETT>凶手绝对不希望我们找到
<29-6,BECKETT>the killer definitely didn't want us to find it.

633
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:55,640
<30-1,RECEPTIONIST>你们好
<30-1,RECEPTIONIST>Oh, hello, there.

634
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,900
<30-2,CASTLE>我猜这一定不是格林布拉特保险公司
<30-2,CASTLE>I'm betting this isn't Greenblatt Insurance.

635
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,040
<30-3,BECKETT>你好  我是贝克特探长  纽约警局

<30-3,BECKETT>is an employee here.

<30-5,CASTLE>What kind of business is this, exactly?

640
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,200
<30-6,RECEPTIONIST>稍等片刻
<30-6,RECEPTIONIST>It'll be just a moment.

641
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:10,590
<30-6,RECEPTIONIST>我好喜欢这件夹克
<30-6,RECEPTIONIST>I love that jacket.

<31-1,HEAD OF SECURITY>If you and Mr. Castle vacate the premises immediately,

645
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:31,680
<31-1,HEAD OF SECURITY>我们就不会以擅闯罪向联邦政府提出起诉
<31-1,HEAD OF SECURITY>we'll refrain from filing Federal trespassing charges.

646
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,570
<31-2,BECKETT>对不起  我们在调查一起谋杀案
<31-2,BECKETT>I'm sorry, we're investigating a homicide.

647

<31-2,BECKETT>得到答复前  是不会离开的
<31-2,BECKETT>We're not leaving without answers.

648
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:37,220
<31-3,CASTLE>向联邦政府提出起诉
<31-3,CASTLE>Uh, Federal charges?

649
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:40,260
<31-3,CASTLE>这一定是个绝密的政府机构
<31-3,CASTLE>It's a top-secret government facility.

650
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,510
<31-3,CASTLE>我说得对  隐形血清
<31-3,CASTLE>I was right. Invisibility serum.

651
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,820
<31-4,HEAD OF SECURITY>你刚才说什么
<31-4,HEAD OF SECURITY>What did you say?

652
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:44,920
<31-5,CASTLE>我刚才说我说得对
<31-5,CASTLE>I said I was right.

655
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,660
<31-4,HEAD OF SECURITY>你刚才说隐形血清是什么意思
<31-4,HEAD OF SECURITY>What did you mean by invisibility serum?

656
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:06,950
<31-7,CASTLE>-我只是说  -卡塞尔
<31-7,CASTLE>- I was just saying that -- - Castle.

657
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:09,650
<31-8,BECKETT>如果想知道答案
<31-8,BECKETT>If you want answers,

658
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:11,260
<31-8,BECKETT>你必须先回答我们几个问题
<31-8,BECKETT>you're gonna have to give us some first.

659
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:14,630
<31-8,BECKETT>除非你希望整个纽约警局的人来敲你的门
<31-8,BECKETT>Unless you want the entire NYPD knocking on your front door.

660
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:17,980
<31-9,SARKOV>你们想知道什么
<31-9,SARKOV>What do you want to know?

661
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:22,230
<31-10,BECKETT>这里是什么地方  跟法维克有什么关系
<31-10,BECKETT>What is this place and how is will Fairwick connected to it?

662
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:25,260
<31-11,SARKOV>卡塞尔先生说得对
<31-11,SARKOV>Mr. Castle is correct.

663
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,950
<31-11,SARKOV>这里是政府机构
<31-11,SARKOV>This is a government facility.

664
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,220
<31-12,CASTLE>中情局  还是国土安全部
<31-12,CASTLE>CIA? Homeland Security.

665
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:31,440
<31-12,CASTLE>莫非是国防高级研究计划局
<31-12,CASTLE>Ah-ah! D.A.R.P.A.?

666
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,490
<31-13,SARKOV>差不多吧
<31-13,SARKOV>Something like that.

667
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:33,630
<31-13,SARKOV>威尔在这里工作
<31-13,SARKOV>Will worked here,

668
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,960
<31-13,SARKOV>他的死对我们来说是莫大的损失
<31-13,SARKOV>and his death was quite a loss to us.

669
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,030
<31-14,BECKETT>这么说你知道他被谋杀了
<31-14,BECKETT>So, you know about his murder.

670
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:40,220
<31-14,BECKETT>他在这是做什么的
<31-14,BECKETT>What did he do here?

671
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,630
<31-15,SARKOV>他曾是我手下的一名科学家
<31-15,SARKOV>He was one of my scientists.

672
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:44,330
<31-15,SARKOV>量子工程学  我从麻省理工把他招来的
<31-15,SARKOV>Quantum engineering. I recruited him out of M.I.T.

673
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:45,270
<31-16,BECKETT>招募
<31-16,BECKETT>Recruited?

674
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:47,400
<31-16,BECKETT>等等  这么说他并没崩溃
<31-16,BECKETT>Wait, so then he never had a breakdown.

675
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:49,370
<31-17,SARKOV>只是掩人耳目的借口
<31-17,SARKOV>Cover story to avoid questions.

676
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:51,970
<31-18,CASTLE>量子工程学  国防高级研究计划局
<31-18,CASTLE>Quantum engineering? D.A.R.P.A.?

677
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:54,070
<31-18,CASTLE>你们的确在研究隐形
<31-18,CASTLE>You are researching invisibility.

678
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:57,640
<31-19,SARKOV>不  卡塞尔先生  隐形纯属科幻
<31-19,SARKOV>No, Mr. Castle. Invisibility is science fiction.

679
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:01,650
<31-20,SARKOV>隐身衣才是科学
<31-20,SARKOV>Cloaking, however, is science.

680
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:04,690
<31-21,SARKOV>我已经回答了你们的问题  现在该我问了
<31-21,SARKOV>I have answered your questions. Now answer mine.

681
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:08,400
<31-21,SARKOV>你们是怎么发现我们研究的技术的
<31-21,SARKOV>How did you find out about our technology?

682
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,180
<31-22,BECKETT>在调查过程中
<31-22,BECKETT>During our investigation,

683
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:12,780
<31-22,BECKETT>我们曾遇到一个看不见的人
<31-22,BECKETT>we encountered an unseen person...

684
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:13,680
<31-23,CASTLE>隐形人
<31-23,CASTLE>Invisible person.

685
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,780
<31-23,CASTLE>出现在威尔的家里
<31-23,CASTLE>...at Will's apartment.

686
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:18,110
<31-24,BECKETT>我们认为不管幕后真凶是谁
<31-24,BECKETT>We believe this whoever was behind his murder,

687
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:20,080
<31-24,BECKETT>鉴于你们所研究的项目
<31-24,BECKETT>and given the research that you're doing here,

688
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,360
<31-24,BECKETT>我们认为凶手和这间机构有关
<31-24,BECKETT>we believe the killer is connected to this facility.

689
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,240
<31-25,SARKOV>这不可能
<31-25,SARKOV>That's impossible.

690
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,350
<31-26,BECKETT>-我们清楚看见了什么  -或没看见什么
<31-26,BECKETT>- We know what we saw. - Or didn't see.

691
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,890
<31-25,SARKOV>不  我说不可能
<31-25,SARKOV>No, it's impossible

692
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:29,990
<31-28,SARKOV>是因为我们的技术还未起效
<31-28,SARKOV>because we haven't gotten our technology to work.

693
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:33,530
<31-28,SARKOV>不过我知道是谁干的
<31-28,SARKOV>But I think I know who did.

694
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,680
<32-1,BECKETT>中国人吗
<32-1,BECKETT>The Chinese?

695
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,840
<32-2,SARKOV>他们一直在研究这项技术
<32-2,SARKOV>They've been pursuing the same technology.

696
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:39,040
<32-2,SARKOV>我们听说他们接近了突破点
<32-2,SARKOV>We heard they were close to a breakthrough.

697
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,460
<32-3,BECKETT>你为什么怀疑他们
<32-3,BECKETT>Why would you suspect them?

698
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:42,120
<32-4,SARKOV>因为几天前
<32-4,SARKOV>Because a few days ago,

699
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,380
<32-4,SARKOV>我们遭受了严重的网络攻击
<32-4,SARKOV>we suffered a crippling cyber attack.

700
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,960
<32-4,SARKOV>所有的数据都被清除了
<32-4,SARKOV>All of our data was wiped out.

701
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:48,720
<32-4,SARKOV>我们的团队追踪病毒
<32-4,SARKOV>Our team managed to trace the virus

702
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,590
<32-4,SARKOV>到上海的一个中转站
<32-4,SARKOV>to a relay station in Shanghai.

703
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:51,610
<32-5,CASTLE>是件隐形衣
<32-5,CASTLE>It's a suit.

704
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:54,570
<32-5,CASTLE>怎么使它隐形
<32-5,CASTLE>How does it turn invisible?

705
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,980
<32-6,SARKOV>通过异介质使光线产生折射
<32-6,SARKOV>By bending light waves over meta materials.

706
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:02,840
<32-7,CASTLE>你们的玩具太酷了
<32-7,CASTLE>You guys have the coolest toys.

707
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:05,030
<32-8,SARKOV>我就是用这个把威尔吸引到这里来
<32-8,SARKOV>It's what I promised Will to lure him here.

708
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:08,030
<32-8,SARKOV>有机会和先进的政府科技近距离接触
<32-8,SARKOV>The opportunity to play - with advanced government tech.

709
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:10,710
<32-8,SARKOV>当然了  作为一个无政府主义者
<32-8,SARKOV>Of course, as an anarchist,

710
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:12,690
<32-8,SARKOV>他把这笑称为和魔鬼结下的契约
<32-8,SARKOV>he joked it was his deal with the devil.

711
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:15,510
<32-9,BECKETT>如果你是对的  中国人也有这样一件衣服
<32-9,BECKETT>If you're right and the Chinese do have a working suit,

712
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:17,110
<32-9,BECKETT>他们为什么攻击威尔呢
<32-9,BECKETT>why would they target Will?

713
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:20,010
<32-10,SARKOV>21世纪  技术就是军备比拼
<32-10,SARKOV>Technology is the arms race of the 21st century.

714
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:22,560
<32-10,SARKOV>威尔是我们研究的核心人物
<32-10,SARKOV>And Will was the key to our research.

715
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:25,810
<32-10,SARKOV>他的死  令我们的研究倒退了好几年
<32-10,SARKOV>His death... sets us back years.

716
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,260
<32-11,SARKOV>-我失陪一下  -好的
<32-11,SARKOV>- Excuse me for just one moment. - Yeah.

717
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,190
<32-12,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<32-12,BECKETT>Castle.

718
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:38,000
<32-13,BECKETT>如果这事幕后主使是中国人
<32-13,BECKETT>If the Chinese are behind this,

719
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,080
<32-13,BECKETT>他们为什么要阻止我们拿走威尔的门卡
<32-13,BECKETT>why would they try to stop us from taking Will's key card,

720
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:43,320
<32-13,BECKETT>塔尔梅奇和他们又有什么关系
<32-13,BECKETT>And what do they have to do with Talmadge?

721
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:44,590
<32-14,CASTLE>我觉得不是中国人
<32-14,CASTLE>I don't think it's the Chinese.

722
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:45,780
<32-15,BECKETT>为什么
<32-15,BECKETT>Why not?

723
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:49,520
<32-16,CASTLE>看到这里的符号了吗  这里
<32-16,CASTLE>Do you see that symbol there that -- there.

724
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:52,570
<32-16,CASTLE>在病毒中不断重复那个  这不是中国字
<32-16,CASTLE>It keeps repeating in the virus -- the one that isn't Chinese.

725
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:57,910
<32-18,CASTLE>那是《大地远征》东山妖精的标志
<32-18,CASTLE>It's a symbol of the east mountain goblins from "Terra Quest."

726
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,220
<32-19,BECKETT>威尔的邻居
<32-19,BECKETT>Will's neighbor.

727
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:01,860
<32-19,BECKETT>亨利·怀特
<32-19,BECKETT>Henry Wright.

728
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:04,150
<33-1,ESPOSITO>警员去了亨利·怀特的公寓
<33-1,ESPOSITO>Unis went - to Henry Wright's apartment,

729
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:06,510
<33-1,ESPOSITO>全空了  衣柜和抽屉干干净净
<33-1,ESPOSITO>Found it cleaned out -- closet and dresser emptied.

730
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:07,230
<33-1,ESPOSITO>那家伙跑了
<33-1,ESPOSITO>Dude's gone.

731
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:08,360
<33-2,BECKETT>调查他有什么结果
<33-2,BECKETT>What have we found on him?

732
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,260
<33-3,ESPOSITO>他是个很有水平的黑客
<33-3,ESPOSITO>Well, he's a serious hacker.

733
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,780
<33-3,ESPOSITO>15岁时  黑进了市电力公司
<33-3,ESPOSITO>At 15, he cracked the city's power grid.

734
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:15,330
<33-3,ESPOSITO>他到20来岁  才接受现身说法教育
<33-3,ESPOSITO>Didn't get scared straight until he was in his 20s.

735
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:16,540
<33-3,ESPOSITO>现在是网络管理
<33-3,ESPOSITO>Now he's a sneaker,

736
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:18,870
<33-3,ESPOSITO>为财富500强企业测试防火墙
<33-3,ESPOSITO>testing cyber defenses for fortune 500 companies.

737
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,440
<33-4,BECKETT>就是说他拥有网络攻击
<33-4,BECKETT>Which means he had the skills necessary

738
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:23,000
<33-4,BECKETT>萨科夫博士实验室的技能
<33-4,BECKETT>to launch a cyber attack against Dr. Sarkov's lab.

739
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,790
<33-5,RYAN>他和这案子还有一个联系
<33-5,RYAN>And, uh, he had another connection to this case.

740
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:27,330
<33-5,RYAN>亨利在加州理工曾经与  稍等
<33-5,RYAN>Henry attended Caltech with -- wait for it --

741
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,840
<33-5,RYAN>被袭击受害人汤姆·塔尔梅奇是同学
<33-5,RYAN>Assault victim Tom Talmadge.

742
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:29,960
<33-5,RYAN>他们曾是室友
<33-5,RYAN>They were roommates.

743
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,570
<33-5,RYAN>这是亨利起诉塔尔梅奇的案子
<33-5,RYAN>This is the lawsuit that Henry filed against Talmadge,

744
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:35,280
<33-5,RYAN>指控他盗取了代码
<33-5,RYAN>accusing him of stealing the code

745
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,870
<33-5,RYAN>后来开发出Hytch
<33-5,RYAN>that he used to build Hytch.

746
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:38,180
<33-5,RYAN>被法院驳回了
<33-5,RYAN>The court dismissed the case.

747
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,790
<33-6,CASTLE>令亨利没能成为亿万富翁
<33-6,CASTLE>Costing Henry billions.

748
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:43,930
<33-6,CASTLE>萨科夫说她的实验室没有破解隐形技术
<33-6,CASTLE>Sarkov said her lab hadn't cracked the cloaking technology,

749
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:47,350
<33-6,CASTLE>但如果威尔在邻居亨利的帮忙下破解了呢
<33-6,CASTLE>but what if Will did with a little help from his neighbor, Henry?

750
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:48,940
<33-6,CASTLE>有了起效的隐形衣
<33-6,CASTLE>And with a functioning suit,

751
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,400
<33-6,CASTLE>亨利可以在威尔的帮助下
<33-6,CASTLE>Henry could've enlisted Will's help

752
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,790
<33-6,CASTLE>向塔尔梅奇报复
<33-6,CASTLE>to get revenge against Talmadge.

753
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:54,980
<33-7,RYAN>但亨利仍需帮助才能破解塔尔梅奇的家庭安保系统
<33-7,RYAN>But Henry still needed help defeating Talmadge's home security.

754
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:57,410
<33-7,RYAN>隐形并不能破解热能或压力系统
<33-7,RYAN>Invisibility doesn't defeat thermal or pressure systems.

755
00:31:57,410 --> 00:31:58,710
<33-8,BECKETT>所以亨利穿着隐形衣
<33-8,BECKETT>So, they hustled Jiggy

756
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:01,220
<33-8,BECKETT>他们联手坑了吉格
<33-8,BECKETT>while Henry was wearing that invisibility suit.

757
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:03,680
<33-8,BECKETT>是亨利移动了球桌上的白球
<33-8,BECKETT>Henry is the one that was moving the cue ball around the table.

758
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:06,010
<33-9,CASTLE>也许当亨利意识到隐形衣的作用后
<33-9,CASTLE>And perhaps once Henry realized the power of the suit,

759
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:07,330
<33-9,CASTLE>他就盯上了威尔
<33-9,CASTLE>he set his sights on Will,

760
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:09,900
<33-9,CASTLE>确保隐形衣永远不会被夺走
<33-9,CASTLE>Making sure that power would never be taken away.

761
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:11,270
<33-10,RYAN>好吧  怎么找这小子
<33-10,RYAN>Okay, how do we find this kid?

762
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:13,100
<33-11,ESPOSITO>没办法  这家伙是顶级黑客
<33-11,ESPOSITO>We don't. The guy's a high-level hacker.

763
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,960
<33-11,ESPOSITO>他有了新的身份  现在应该已经出国了
<33-11,ESPOSITO>He's got a new I.D. and he's out of the country by now.

764
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,970
<33-11,ESPOSITO>他会利用自己的技能  像国王一样生活
<33-11,ESPOSITO>He'll trade on his skills and live like a king.

765
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:20,510
<33-12,CASTLE>事实上  他已经像国王一样生活着
<33-12,CASTLE>Actually, he's already living like a king,

766
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:22,190
<33-12,CASTLE>这会助我们找到他
<33-12,CASTLE>and that's how we're gonna find him.

767
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:26,740
<34-1,GAME NARRATOR>欢迎来到《大地远征》  冒险在等着你
<34-1,GAME NARRATOR>Welcome to "Terra Quest." Adventure awaits.

768
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,520
<34-1,GAME NARRATOR>好了
<34-1,GAME NARRATOR>All right.

769
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:33,220
<34-2,CASTLE>东山妖精大军
<34-2,CASTLE>East mountain goblin army is attacking

770
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:35,240
<34-2,CASTLE>从奥尔峰基地开始进攻
<34-2,CASTLE>from the base of mt. Orr,

771
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:38,260
<34-2,CASTLE>就是说他们的国王会带领他们进入战斗
<34-2,CASTLE>which means their king will be leading them into battle.

772
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,310
<35-2,CASTLE>他在那里
<35-2,CASTLE>There he is.

773
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:42,780
<34-1,GAME NARRATOR>那是亨利
<34-1,GAME NARRATOR>That's Henry.

774
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:45,990
<34-2,CASTLE>他在哪里弄了一把青龙剑
<34-2,CASTLE>Where did he get a falchion sword?

775
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,850
<34-2,CASTLE>那玩意要90以上的征服分呢
<34-2,CASTLE>That's like plus-90 conquest points.

776
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:49,100
<34-3,BECKETT>可以锁定头像吗
<34-3,BECKETT>Can you get a lock on that avatar

777
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:51,160
<34-3,BECKETT>看能否追踪到亨利在哪里登陆的
<34-3,BECKETT>and see if you can trace the location where Henry logged in?

778
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,180
<34-4,TORY>我想可以
<34-4,TORY>I think so.

779
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,730
<34-5,CASTLE>我会加入战斗
<34-5,CASTLE>And I will join the battle...

780
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:57,050
<34-5,CASTLE>拖住他
<34-5,CASTLE>...And slow him down.

781
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:10,820
<35-1,CASTLE>我还以为地下游戏窝点只是传说呢
<35-1,CASTLE>I thought underground gaming dens were just legend.

782
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:13,220
<35-2,CASTLE>我还以为隐形人也不是真的呢
<35-2,CASTLE>Yeah, well, I thought - the invisible man wasn't real.

783
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:15,000
<35-2,CASTLE>他在那里
<35-2,CASTLE>There he is.

784
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:17,300
<35-2,CASTLE>亨利
<35-2,CASTLE>Henry!

785
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:19,070
<35-3,BECKETT>站住  站住
<35-3,BECKETT>Stop! Stop!

786
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,370
<35-3,BECKETT>拦住他
<35-3,BECKETT>Stop him!

787
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:21,610
<35-3,BECKETT>站住
<35-3,BECKETT>Stop!

788
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:30,450
<35-4,CASTLE>现在青龙剑在谁手中啊
<35-4,CASTLE>Who's got the falchion sword now?

789
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,900
<36-1,HENRY>我没有杀威尔  他是我的朋友
<36-1,HENRY>I didn't murder Will. He was my friend.

790
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,210
<36-2,BECKETT>那你为什么要跑  亨利
<36-2,BECKETT>Then why did you run, Henry?

791
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:49,470
<36-3,BECKETT>我们知道你找过汤姆·塔尔梅奇麻烦
<36-3,BECKETT>Look, we know that you went after Tom Talmadge.

792
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:51,190
<36-3,BECKETT>你策划了一起网络攻击
<36-3,BECKETT>You were behind a cyber attack

793
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:53,660
<36-3,BECKETT>搞垮了政府实验室
<36-3,BECKETT>that brought down a government lab,

794
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:56,920
<36-3,BECKETT>然后你清空你的公寓消失了
<36-3,BECKETT>And then you cleaned out your apartment and you disappeared.

795
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,440
<36-4,HENRY>因为我害怕他们接下来会找我
<36-4,HENRY>Because I was afraid that they would come after me next.

796
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,160
<36-5,BECKETT>谁
<36-5,BECKETT>Who?

797
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,570
<36-6,HENRY>杀掉威尔的人
<36-6,HENRY>The same people that killed Will.

798
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,580
<36-6,HENRY>如果他们发现我知道...
<36-6,HENRY>All right, if they found out that I knew...

799
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:07,520
<36-7,BECKETT>你知道什么
<36-7,BECKETT>That you knew what?

800
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:11,020
<36-7,BECKETT>你帮了他对吗
<36-7,BECKETT>You helped him, didn't you?

801
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,080
<36-7,BECKETT>你帮他造了隐形衣
<36-7,BECKETT>You helped him build a working suit.

802
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:16,480
<36-8,HENRY>威尔带着超前的想法来找我
<36-8,HENRY>Will came to me with an out-there idea.

803
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:20,260
<36-8,HENRY>他要将自然伪装运用到
<36-8,HENRY>He wanted to adopt nature's camouflage

804
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,610
<36-8,HENRY>结构材料中
<36-8,HENRY>to meta materials.

805
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:23,880
<36-8,HENRY>但他的实验室
<36-8,HENRY>But there wasn't anybody in his lab

806
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:26,850
<36-8,HENRY>没人有我这种编码技术  因为我不可能
<36-8,HENRY>that had my program skills, and since there was no way

807
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:28,470
<36-8,HENRY>通过安全审查
<36-8,HENRY>I was gonna get security clearance,

808
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:30,380
<36-8,HENRY>我们只能偷偷地进行
<36-8,HENRY>we worked on the down low.

809
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:32,150
<36-9,BECKETT>作为交换  你可以用他的隐形衣
<36-9,BECKETT>And in exchange, you got to use his suit

810
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:34,170
<36-9,BECKETT>向塔尔梅奇报复  对吗
<36-9,BECKETT>to exact your revenge against Talmadge, right?

811
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:35,690
<36-10,HENRY>本不该发生的
<36-10,HENRY>That wasn't supposed to happen.

812
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:37,700
<36-10,HENRY>我只是在找证据
<36-10,HENRY>I was just looking for proof

813
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,410
<36-10,HENRY>证明汤姆偷了我开发Hytch的理念
<36-10,HENRY>that Tom stole my idea for Hytch.

814
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:41,500
<36-11,BECKETT>但他被打断的肋骨可没有证实你的话
<36-11,BECKETT>Yeah, well, - his broken ribs say otherwise.

815
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,160
<36-12,HENRY>我找不到需要的证据
<36-12,HENRY>I couldn't find what I needed.

816
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:47,530
<36-12,HENRY>然后汤姆提前回到家
<36-12,HENRY>And then Tom came home early.

817
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,850
<36-12,HENRY>我只是想捉弄他一下
<36-12,HENRY>I-I just wanted to mess with him.

818
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:54,720
<36-12,HENRY>但我失控了
<36-12,HENRY>But I snapped.

819
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,600
<36-12,HENRY>威尔听到挣扎声  进来拉开了我
<36-12,HENRY>Will heard the struggle, he came in, and he pulled me off.

820
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:04,000
<36-13,BECKETT>威尔制止你  你生气了
<36-13,BECKETT>You got angry with Will for stopping you.

821
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:08,320
<36-13,BECKETT>所以你决定用他的隐形衣来干掉他
<36-13,BECKETT>So, you decided to use his suit to kill him instead, right?

822
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:09,010
<36-13,BECKETT>不
<36-13,BECKETT>No!

823
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:11,640
<36-14,HENRY>我们都意识到我变成了佛罗多
<36-14,HENRY>We both realized that I had become Frodo,

824
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,340
<36-14,HENRY>那件隐形衣就是统治一切的魔戒
<36-14,HENRY>and the suit was the one ring to rule them all!

825
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:17,590
<36-14,HENRY>威尔知道任谁拥有都会得到过大的权力
<36-14,HENRY>Will knew it was too much power for anyone to have,

826
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:19,070
<36-14,HENRY>尤其是政府
<36-14,HENRY>especially the government.

827
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,350
<36-15,BECKETT>所以威尔成了奥本海默[曼哈顿计划领导者之一]
<36-15,BECKETT>So, that was Will's Oppenheimer moment.

828
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:25,750
<36-15,BECKETT>隐形衣变成了原子弹
<36-15,BECKETT>The suit became the atomic bomb.

829
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:27,250
<36-16,HENRY>隐形衣需要被销毁
<36-16,HENRY>All right, - it needed to be destroyed.

830
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:29,840
<36-16,HENRY>投进魔域之火
<36-16,HENRY>Cast into the fires of mordor.

831
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,630
<36-16,HENRY>我们黑进实验室是为了使他们无法重建该技术
<36-16,HENRY>We sabotaged the lab so that they couldn't rebuild the tech,

832
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,880
<36-16,HENRY>至少不是马上重建
<36-16,HENRY>at least not right away.

833
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,080
<36-16,HENRY>没了威尔从头足类动物那
<36-16,HENRY>And without the quantum cellular equations

834
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,890
<36-16,HENRY>导出的量子细胞方程式
<36-16,HENRY>Will derived from cephalopods,

835
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:40,480
<36-16,HENRY>他们可能永远也重建不了
<36-16,HENRY>they may never be able to.

836
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,210
<36-17,BECKETT>头足类动物  鱿鱼吗
<36-17,BECKETT>Cephalopods? Like squids?

837
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:44,690
<36-18,HENRY>事实上  威尔
<36-18,HENRY>Actually, um, Will,

838
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:47,090
<36-18,HENRY>的方程式是通过墨鱼得出的
<36-18,HENRY>he based his equations off of the cuttlefish.

839
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,180
<37-1,VIDEO NARRATOR>墨鱼是大自然公认的
<37-1,VIDEO NARRATOR>The cuttlefish is known

840
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:55,430
<37-1,VIDEO NARRATOR>伪装之王
<37-1,VIDEO NARRATOR>as nature's king of camouflage.

841
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:56,720
<37-2,CASTLE>听这段
<37-2,CASTLE>And listen to this.

842
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,210
<37-2,CASTLE>墨鱼的乳突有着独特的能力
<37-2,CASTLE>"The papillae of the cuttlefish are unique in their ability

843
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:01,260
<37-2,CASTLE>通过迅速极化反射光波
<37-2,CASTLE>"to rapidly polarize reflected light waves

844
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:03,230
<37-2,CASTLE>改变其表皮颜色
<37-2,CASTLE>and change the creature's skin color."

845
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:05,440
<37-2,CASTLE>这才是威尔联系多娜的原因
<37-2,CASTLE>That's why will got back in touch with donna.

846
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:07,520
<37-3,BECKETT>他不是还惦念着她  他想要她的研究
<37-3,BECKETT>He didn't want her. He wanted her research.

847
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,870
<37-3,BECKETT>卡塞尔  看威尔的通讯记录
<37-3,BECKETT>Castle, look at Will's phone records.

848
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,120
<37-3,BECKETT>连续多周  他俩之间
<37-3,BECKETT>For weeks, there were phone calls

849
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,420
<37-3,BECKETT>有着多次的相互通话
<37-3,BECKETT>going back and forth between the two of them,

850
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:19,170
<37-3,BECKETT>在他死前三天
<37-3,BECKETT>and then three days before his death,

851
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:21,260
<37-3,BECKETT>就是在他让隐形衣起效之时
<37-3,BECKETT>right when he got that suit to function,

852
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:23,450
<37-3,BECKETT>就只有她打给他的电话了
<37-3,BECKETT>there were only incoming calls from her.

853
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:24,750
<37-3,BECKETT>威尔不接电话了
<37-3,BECKETT>Will wasn't answering.

854
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:27,960
<37-4,CASTLE>谋杀案之后  她就不打电话了
<37-4,CASTLE>And right after will was murdered, she stops calling,

855
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,720
<37-4,CASTLE>就好像她已经知道他死了似的
<37-4,CASTLE>almost as if she knew he was dead.

856
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,950
<37-5,RYAN>伙计们  我给大学打了电话
<37-5,RYAN>Hey, guys. I called the university.

857
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:34,240
<37-5,RYAN>猜猜谁在威尔被谋杀那晚取消了自己的课
<37-5,RYAN>Guess who canceled their class the night will was killed.

858
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:41,430
<38-1,DONNA>怎么回事
<38-1,DONNA>What's going on here?

859
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:42,830
<38-1,DONNA>这是私人办公室
<38-1,DONNA>This is a private office.

860
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:44,460
<38-2,BECKETT>隶属于这所大学
<38-2,BECKETT>Which belongs to the university.

861
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:46,150
<38-2,BECKETT>校长给了我们搜查的允许
<38-2,BECKETT>The dean gave us permission to search it

862
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:47,540
<38-2,BECKETT>作为我们调查的一部分
<38-2,BECKETT>as a part of our investigation.

863
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:50,510
<38-3,DONNA>等等  你认为我跟威尔的死有关
<38-3,DONNA>Wait. You think I had something to do with Will's death?

864
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:52,990
<38-4,BECKETT>多娜  他被杀那晚你错过了自己的课
<38-4,BECKETT>Donna, you missed your class the night that he was killed.

865
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:53,880
<38-4,BECKETT>你在哪
<38-4,BECKETT>Where were you?

866
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:55,740
<38-5,DONNA>感冒在家休息
<38-5,DONNA>At home with a cold.

867
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,360
<38-5,DONNA>我不会伤害威尔的  我爱他
<38-5,DONNA>I never would've hurt Wwill. I loved him.

868
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:01,060
<38-6,BECKETT>你爱他  他却背叛了你
<38-6,BECKETT>You loved him, but then he betrayed you.

869
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:03,690
<38-7,CASTLE>他的背叛一定令你很愤怒
<38-7,CASTLE>That must have made you angry to find out

870
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:05,930
<38-7,CASTLE>发现他不过是在利用你得到研究成果
<38-7,CASTLE>that he was just using you for your research.

871
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:08,240
<38-8,DONNA>那不是真的
<38-8,DONNA>That's not true.

872
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,780
<38-9,BECKETT>那是他第二次抛弃你
<38-9,BECKETT>That was the second time that he left you,

873
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:11,280
<38-9,BECKETT>他令你蒙羞  你无法接受这一切
<38-9,BECKETT>and you couldn't live with the embarrassment.

874
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,130
<38-10,DONNA>胡说  这太扯了
<38-10,DONNA>This is ridiculous.

875
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:12,940
<38-10,DONNA>我不会站在这
<38-10,DONNA>I'm not gonna stand here

876
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,890
<38-10,DONNA>任由你们指责我杀害了我的男友
<38-10,DONNA>and let you accuse me of killing my boyfriend.

877
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:17,970
<38-11,BECKETT>多娜  是你穿着隐形衣在公寓与我们搏斗
<38-11,BECKETT>Donna, that was you in the suit in the apartment with us.

878
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,950
<38-11,BECKETT>你用同一件隐形衣杀了威尔
<38-11,BECKETT>That's the same suit that you used to kill Will.

879
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:23,440
<38-11,BECKETT>你发现了他的研究
<38-11,BECKETT>You found out about his project,

880
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,040
<38-11,BECKETT>在他毁掉它之前
<38-11,BECKETT>and before he could destroy it,

881
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,890
<38-11,BECKETT>你用他自己的发明解决了他
<38-11,BECKETT>you used his own creation against him.

882
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:29,230
<38-12,DONNA>什么隐形衣  你在说什么
<38-12,DONNA>What suit? What are you talking about?

883
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:31,940
<38-13,CASTLE>你穿着那件去抢威尔的门卡
<38-13,CASTLE>The suit you wore when you went after Will's key card

884
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:33,830
<38-13,CASTLE>却最终拿走了我的信用卡
<38-13,CASTLE>and you got my credit card instead.

885
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:36,220
<38-13,CASTLE>刚刚在你抽屉末端底部找到的
<38-13,CASTLE>Just found it buried in the back of your drawer.

886
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:38,050
<38-13,CASTLE>随便感谢你  我忘记挂失了
<38-13,CASTLE>Thank you for that, by the way. I forgot to cancel this.

887
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:39,280
<38-13,CASTLE>要是挂失  解挂很麻烦的
<38-13,CASTLE>That can be such a pain.

888
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,420
<38-14,DONNA>我应该做什么  放过他吗
<38-14,DONNA>What was I supposed to do, let him get away with it?

889
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:46,050
<38-14,DONNA>他不再打来电话  不再发短信
<38-14,DONNA>He stopped calling, stopped texting.

890
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,390
<38-14,DONNA>他利用了我
<38-14,DONNA>He used me!

891
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,270
<38-14,DONNA>还竟敢假装我不存在
<38-14,DONNA>And then pretended like I didn't exist.

892
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:54,910
<38-14,DONNA>他希望我从他的生活中消失
<38-14,DONNA>He wanted me to just disappear from his life.

893
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:58,010
<38-14,DONNA>我的确消失了
<38-14,DONNA>So I did.

894
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:01,080
<38-14,DONNA>我让他措手不及
<38-14,DONNA>And he never saw me coming.

895
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,890
<38-15,BECKETT>多娜·布鲁克斯  你因谋杀
<38-15,BECKETT>Donna Brooks, you're under arrest --

896
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:12,120
<38-17,BECKETT>-去追  -好
<38-17,BECKETT>- You go. - Okay. Okay.

897
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:14,220
<38-18,CASTLE>我来放下这个
<38-18,CASTLE>Okay, I'll get this.

898
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:23,570
<39-1,CASTLE>她的背包和衣服
<39-1,CASTLE>Her backpack and clothes.

899
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,230
<39-1,CASTLE>她穿上了隐形衣
<39-1,CASTLE>She's wearing the suit.

900
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:26,490
<39-2,BECKETT>卡塞尔  抵住门
<39-2,BECKETT>Castle, block the door.

901
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,610
<39-2,BECKETT>好
<39-2,BECKETT>Right.

902
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:32,020
<39-3,CASTLE>这次不会让她溜走了
<39-3,CASTLE>She is not slipping past this time.

903
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:38,030
<39-4,BECKETT>多娜  你跑不掉的
<39-4,BECKETT>Donna, there's nowhere to go.

904
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,460
<39-4,BECKETT>这下你完蛋了
<39-4,BECKETT>Yeah, gotcha now!

905
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,210
<39-5,CASTLE>我好想念咱俩心有灵犀啊
<39-5,CASTLE>I so missed these mind melds.

906
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,180
<39-5,CASTLE>两点钟方向
<39-5,CASTLE>2 o'clock!

907
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:34,520
<39-5,CASTLE>她在那
<39-5,CASTLE>She's right there.

908
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,370
<40-1,RYAN>贝克特  如果你能隐形会做什么
<40-1,RYAN>Beckett, what would you do if you were invisible?

909
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:58,020
<40-2,BECKETT>我会在没有完成案件报告的情况下开溜
<40-2,BECKETT>I'd walk out of here without having to file this report.

910
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:00,210
<40-3,RYAN>无聊
<40-3,RYAN>Boring.

911
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:02,240
<40-5,ESPOSITO>你呢  卡塞尔
<40-5,ESPOSITO>How about you, Castle?

912
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:04,980
