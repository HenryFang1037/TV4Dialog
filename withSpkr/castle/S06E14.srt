<1-2,JUSTIN>简直就是孤独养猫老太太加大卫·鲍伊[英国音乐人]
<1-2,JUSTIN>It was very "sad cat lady meets David Bowie."

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,760
<1-3,LOLA>我们就沦落到这个地步了  在垃圾箱里找布料
<1-3,LOLA>This is what it's come to -- dumpster-diving to find fabric

6
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,300
<1-3,LOLA>准备我们的期中高级女式时装作业
<1-3,LOLA>for our midterm haute couture project.

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,180
<1-4,JUSTIN>俗话说得好
<1-4,JUSTIN>Well, you know what they say.

8
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:21,350
<1-4,JUSTIN>一个人的垃圾是另一个人的...
<1-4,JUSTIN>One man's trash is another man's --

<1-5,LOLA>-我好像有发现  -我也是

00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:26,530
<1-6,JUSTIN>卡住了
<1-6,JUSTIN>It's stuck.

11
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:28,490
<1-7,LOLA>因为我们在拽一件东西
<1-7,LOLA>That's because we're both tugging on it.

12
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:30,080
<1-8,JUSTIN>-放手  -我先拿到的
<1-8,JUSTIN>- Let go. - I had it first.

13
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:35,620
<2-1,MARTHA RODGERS>这布料真是要迷死人了
<2-1,MARTHA RODGERS>Oh, this fabric is just to die for.

20
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,050
<2-4,MARTHA>各种美妙绚丽的婚礼杂志
<2-4,MARTHA>to the glorious world of wedding magazines.

21
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,550
<2-5,BECKETT>这些杂志都很女性化  有很多痴情新娘
<2-5,BECKETT>They are all very girly, with a lot of gauzy photos

22
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:56,280
<2-5,BECKETT>身着薄纱衣物  目光投向远方的照片
<2-5,BECKETT>of love-struck brides looKing off into the distance.

23
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,930
<2-6,CASTLE>或许他们在思考高达50%的离婚率
<2-6,CASTLE>Perhaps they're contemplating the 50% divorce rate.

24
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:02,140
<2-7,MARTHA>不要被这些杂志的梦幻的表面迷惑
<2-7,MARTHA>You know what, you need to get beyond the fairytale-treacle aspect

27
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,040
<2-7,MARTHA>要以他们的本质作用看待他们
<2-7,MARTHA>of these magazines and see them for what they are --

29
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:08,090
<2-7,MARTHA>为你筹划婚礼提供思路的源泉
<2-7,MARTHA>a source of ideas as you plan your wedding.

31
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:09,020
<2-7,MARTHA>有道理
<2-7,MARTHA>Yeah.

32
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:10,930
<2-8,CASTLE>看这里
<2-8,CASTLE>Like this place.

33
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,340
<2-8,CASTLE>科尔多瓦宅邸
<2-8,CASTLE>The Cordova House?

35
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:16,030
<2-9,BECKETT>标志性的西班牙殖民复兴风格宅邸
<2-9,BECKETT>Uh, "A landmark Spanish revival mansion

36
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:18,760

<2-10,CASTLE>始建于世纪之交
<2-10,CASTLE>"It was built at the turn of the century,

38
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:22,780
<2-10,CASTLE>是建筑美学的永恒遗产
<2-10,CASTLE>remains an enduring legacy of architectural beauty

39
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:24,440
<2-10,CASTLE>就位于曼哈顿中心
<2-10,CASTLE>in the heart of Manhattan."

40
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,480
<2-11,MARTHA>我记得这里
<2-11,MARTHA>I remember the Cordova House.

41
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,870
<2-11,MARTHA>70年代的时候  那里是一个艺术场馆
<2-11,MARTHA>It was like a cultural venue for the arts in the '70s.

42
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,610
<2-11,MARTHA>我好像去哪里参加过一个派对
<2-11,MARTHA>I think I went to a party there.

43
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:35,410
<2-11,MARTHA>不过那是70年代嘛  所以我也拿不准
<2-11,MARTHA>Of course, it was the '70s, so I can't be sure.

44
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:36,810
<2-12,BECKETT>这上面说他们进行了翻修
<2-12,BECKETT>This says it's been refurbished.

45
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,400
<2-12,BECKETT>并且开始接受婚礼预定了

47
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:44,800
<2-15,CASTLE>莫非我们偶然找到了一个我们都认同的婚礼场所
<2-15,CASTLE>Could it be that we've stumbled upon a venue we actually agree on.

48
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,760
<2-16,BECKETT>是啊  至少我挺喜欢  你呢

00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:27,010
<4-9,LILLIAN>她本期望在《当代时尚》工作能给她更多机会
<4-9,LILLIAN>She hoped working at Modern Fashion would open doors for her.

118
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,860
<4-10,ESPOSITO>据你所知  艾拉遇到什么麻烦了吗
<4-10,ESPOSITO>Was Ella having any problems that you know of?

119
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,940
<4-11,LILLIAN>她最近压力很大
<4-11,LILLIAN>Um... She had been stressed lately,

120
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,390
<4-11,LILLIAN>比平时的压力还大
<4-11,LILLIAN>a little more than usual.

121
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:37,390
<4-11,LILLIAN>我问她时  她只说是工作上的事  没详说
<4-11,LILLIAN>I asked her. She said it was work, but she didn't go into details.

122
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,590
<4-12,RYAN>莉莉安  如果可以的话

<4-14,LILLIAN>我们这里没有信号
<4-14,LILLIAN>Oh, we don't get cell reception in here.

<4-14,LILLIAN>-用我的座机吧  -谢谢
<4-14,LILLIAN>- You can use my landline if you like. - Thanks.

00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,700
<5-1,BECKETT>时尚界的职业联盟
<5-1,BECKETT>The big leagues for anyone who wants to work in fashion.

134
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,680
<5-2,CASTLE>看来要在这儿工作都必须是辣妹
<5-2,CASTLE>Wow. Apparently, you have to be a total hottie just to work here.

135
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,740
<5-2,CASTLE>我是以一个完全不在乎这一切的
<5-2,CASTLE>And I'm saying that as a completely detached,

136
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,000
<5-2,CASTLE>准新郎的身份说这话的
<5-2,CASTLE>soon-to-be-married observer.

138
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,560
<5-4,CASTLE>不行  不过想不看都难
<5-4,CASTLE>Actually, no. But it's kind of hard not to.

139
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,140
<5-5,BECKETT>玛蒂尔达只雇那些
<5-5,BECKETT>I mean, Matilda only hires people

140
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:25,630
<5-5,BECKETT>符合杂志风格的人  你必须看上去像那么回事
<5-5,BECKETT>that fit the magazine's brand. You have to...Look the part.

141
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:27,110
<5-6,CASTLE>你对玛蒂尔达·金似乎很了解啊
<5-6,CASTLE>You seem to know a lot about Matilda King.

00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,430
<5-7,BECKETT>总会听到些传闻嘛
<5-7,BECKETT>Yeah, well, I've picked up a thing or two.

<5-10,CARRIE>如果我把你加入她的日程她会发疯的
<5-10,CARRIE>She's going to freak out if I add you to the schedule.

149
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,630
<5-10,CARRIE>你们知道之前的那个助理有多惨吗
<5-10,CARRIE>Do you have any idea what happened to the last assistant?

00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,240
<5-11,BECKETT>知道  她死了
<5-11,BECKETT>Yes. She's dead.

151
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,020
<5-12,CARRIE>死了  什么意思

<5-13,MATILDA KING>-不行  -天呐  她来了
<5-13,MATILDA KING>- No, no, no, no. - Oh, God. Here she comes.

<5-14,CARRIE>我绝不接受拒绝
<5-14,CARRIE>I won't take no for an answer.

159
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,360
<5-15,MATILDA>不过当然是往错误的方向推动
<5-15,MATILDA>No doubt, in the wrong direction.

<5-15,MATILDA>给我回话哦

<5-24,BECKETT>When I was a model... for about 15 minutes.

00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:37,190
<5-25,CASTLE>你为《当代时尚》做过模特
<5-25,CASTLE>You modeled for Modern Fashion?

<5-26,MATILDA>直至今日  你还是唯一拒绝我的人
<5-26,MATILDA>To date, you're the only person to ever tell me no.

178
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,220
<5-26,MATILDA>我现在忙得很
<5-26,MATILDA>I'm wall-to-wall.

00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:53,940
<5-27,CASTLE>我们要问你几个问题
<5-27,CASTLE>We need to ask you a few questions

182
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,600
<5-28,BECKETT>是关于你的助理  艾拉·海因斯
<5-28,BECKETT>about your assistant, Ella Hayes.

183
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,830
<5-28,BECKETT>而且等不得
<5-28,BECKETT>It cannot wait.

<5-29,MATILDA>去我办公室谈吧  电话不要接进来
<5-29,MATILDA>We'll talk in my office. Hold my calls.

185
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:03,590
<5-29,MATILDA>对了  艾拉是前助理了
<5-29,MATILDA>By the way, Ella is my former assistant.

186
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,860
<6-1,MATILDA>稍等一下  朱利安
<6-1,MATILDA>Be right with you, Julian.

187
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,570
<6-2,BECKETT>你说前助理是什么意思
<6-2,BECKETT>Uh, so, what do you mean by "former"?

188
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:16,810
<6-3,MATILDA>我昨天下午炒掉了她
<6-3,MATILDA>I fired her yesterday afternoon,

189
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,230
<6-3,MATILDA>她的日程安排错了
<6-3,MATILDA>after she made a scheduling mistake

190
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,990
<6-3,MATILDA>害我晚到了一个董事会议
<6-3,MATILDA>and I showed up to a board meeting late.

191
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:24,700
<6-3,MATILDA>她上周还犯过类似错误
<6-3,MATILDA>And that was after her mistake last week,

192
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:28,970
<6-3,MATILDA>结果我让杂志的新东家等了我45分钟
<6-3,MATILDA>when I kept the new owner of our magazine waiting for 45 minutes.

193
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:32,400
<6-4,JULIAN BRUCKNER>玛蒂尔达  你看到"美妙五人"摄影的校样了吗
<6-4,JULIAN BRUCKNER>Matilda, have you seen the proofs from the "Fab Five" photo shoot?

194
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,880
<6-4,JULIAN BRUCKNER>真是美极了
<6-4,JULIAN BRUCKNER>They are divine.

195
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,570
<6-5,MATILDA>希望如此  朱利安
<6-5,MATILDA>They'd better be, Julian.

196
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:38,730
<6-5,MATILDA>你目前拿给我的东西可都不怎么样
<6-5,MATILDA>So far, everything you've submitted has been rather distrait.

197
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:41,660
<6-6,JULIAN>玛蒂尔达这些设计师都还乳臭未干
<6-6,JULIAN>Oh, Matilda, these designers are barely out of diapers.

198
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,000
<6-7,BECKETT>抱歉  打扰一下
<6-7,BECKETT>E-excuse me. Sorry.

199
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,230
<6-7,BECKETT>我们在调查凶杀案
<6-7,BECKETT>We're investigating a murder here.

200
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,690
<6-8,MATILDA>凶杀
<6-8,MATILDA>Murder?

201
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,360
<6-8,MATILDA>谁死了
<6-8,MATILDA>Of whom?

202
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:51,530
<6-9,CASTLE>你的前助理艾拉
<6-9,CASTLE>Your former assistant, Ella.

203
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,000
<6-10,JULIAN>艾拉死了  怎么死的
<6-10,JULIAN>El-- Ella's dead? How?

204
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:55,460
<6-11,CASTLE>我们也想搞清楚
<6-11,CASTLE>That's what we're trying to figure out.

205
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,410
<6-11,CASTLE>你们知道她有什么麻烦吗
<6-11,CASTLE>Now, do you know if she had any problems?

206
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:02,870
<6-12,JULIAN>这不会跟她和格蕾丝的事有关吧
<6-12,JULIAN>You don't think this had anything to do with that incident with Grace?

207
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:03,830
<6-13,BECKETT>什么事
<6-13,BECKETT>What incident?

208
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:04,930
<6-14,CASTLE>谁是格蕾丝
<6-14,CASTLE>And who's Grace?

209
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,720
<6-15,MATILDA>格蕾丝是我另一个助理  也被我炒了
<6-15,MATILDA>Grace is my other assistant, whom I fired

210
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,700
<6-15,MATILDA>因为她没有及时纠正日程安排的错误
<6-15,MATILDA>because she allowed the scheduling mistakes to happen.

211
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,080
<6-16,BECKETT>那她俩之间有什么事
<6-16,BECKETT>And what was the incident?

212
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:15,010
<6-17,JULIAN>昨天艾拉和格蕾丝
<6-17,JULIAN>Well, apparently, yesterday, when Ella and Grace

213
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:17,190
<6-17,JULIAN>由保安护送离开的时候
<6-17,JULIAN>were escorted out of the building by security,

214
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,600
<6-17,JULIAN>大打出手
<6-17,JULIAN>they literally got into a brawl,

215
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,040
<6-17,JULIAN>就在摄影现场
<6-17,JULIAN>right in the middle of a photo shoot.

216
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,280
<6-17,JULIAN>摄影师塞奇不得不出手阻止
<6-17,JULIAN>The photographer, Serge, had to break it up.

217
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,620
<7-1,SERGE>是啊  她俩真的是大动干戈
<7-1,SERGE>Yeah. The two of them really went at it.

218
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,380
<7-1,SERGE>牟足了力气的小妞大战
<7-1,SERGE>I mean, it was a full-on catfight.

219
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:27,800
<7-1,SERGE>还挺性感的
<7-1,SERGE>It was actually kind of sexy.

220
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,400
<7-2,BECKETT>她俩为什么打架
<7-2,BECKETT>What exactly was the fight about?

221
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:31,120
<7-3,SERGE>为了工作
<7-3,SERGE>It was about the job. Okay?

222
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,220
<7-3,SERGE>我听到格蕾丝怪艾拉害她丢了饭碗
<7-3,SERGE>I overheard Grace blame Ella for -- for getting her fired.

223
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:35,250
<7-4,YUMI>塞奇
<7-4,YUMI>Serge!

224
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,510
<7-4,YUMI>还要多久
<7-4,YUMI>How long will this take?

225
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,490
<7-4,YUMI>我完成设计的最后期限就要到了
<7-4,YUMI>I'm up against a deadline to finish my design.

226
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:41,100
<7-5,SERGE>为了取悦玛蒂尔达  你就在这儿等着吧
<7-5,SERGE>You'll be here as long as it takes to make Matilda happy.

227
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,370
<7-6,SERGE>我们都要遵从的咒语
<7-6,SERGE>The mantra we all live by.

228
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:47,710
<7-7,BECKETT>关于那场打斗你还记得其它细节吗
<7-7,BECKETT>Uh, did you remember any other details about the fight?

229
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,790
<7-8,SERGE>不止记得  我可以给你们看
<7-8,SERGE>I can do better than that. I can show you something.

230
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:50,860
<7-8,SERGE>我当时在摄影
<7-8,SERGE>I was shooting at the time.

231
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,890
<7-8,SERGE>拍到了几张她们出现在背景里的照片
<7-8,SERGE>And got a few frames with them in the background.

232
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:57,440
<7-9,SERGE>就这儿  看吧
<7-9,SERGE>There. Check it out.

233
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,860
<7-10,CASTLE>能放大她俩吗
<7-10,CASTLE>Can...you zoom in on that?

234
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:00,760
<7-11,SERGE>能
<7-11,SERGE>Sure.

235
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,720
<7-12,CASTLE>看格蕾丝的围巾
<7-12,CASTLE>Check out Grace's scarf.

236
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,270
<7-13,BECKETT>蕾妮说艾拉是被勒杀
<7-13,BECKETT>Lanie said she found blue hairs

237
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:07,510
<7-13,BECKETT>且在颈部发现了蓝色毛发
<7-13,BECKETT>on Ella's neck from being strangled.

238
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:08,920
<7-14,CASTLE>看来格蕾丝穿着杀人装束
<7-14,CASTLE>Looks like Grace was dressed to kill.

249
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:23,450
<8-1,GRACE>我从小看着《当代时尚》长大的
<8-1,GRACE>Look, I grew up reading Modern Fashion.

250
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:26,130
<8-1,GRACE>为玛蒂尔达·金工作简直是我的梦想
<8-1,GRACE>Working for Matilda King, that was my dream.

251
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:28,510
<8-1,GRACE>被玛蒂尔达解雇的人  圈内都记得
<8-1,GRACE>But when Matilda fires someone, people remember,

252
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:31,540
<8-1,GRACE>也就是说我在时尚圈基本混不下去了
<8-1,GRACE>which means my career in fashion is pretty much done,

253
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,430
<8-1,GRACE>多亏了艾拉
<8-1,GRACE>thanks to Ella.

254
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:34,490
<8-2,BECKETT>你认为你被炒是她的错
<8-2,BECKETT>Because you believed it was her fault that you got fired.

255
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:35,950
<8-2,BECKETT>就是她的错
<8-2,BECKETT>It was her fault.

256
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,380
<8-3,GRACE>她之所以会犯错  是因为她忙于
<8-3,GRACE>She started making mistakes because she was so busy

257
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:40,270
<8-3,GRACE>拍优美那种设计师的马屁
<8-3,GRACE>sucking up to designers like Yumi

258
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:42,890
<8-3,GRACE>还有炫耀她的草图  却害我付出了代价
<8-3,GRACE>and showing off her sketches, and I paid the price.

259
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:44,440
<8-4,BECKETT>所以你杀了她
<8-4,BECKETT>Which is why you killed her.

260
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,390
<8-4,BECKETT>你到底在说什么
<8-4,BECKETT>What are you even talking about?

261
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,570
<8-5,GRACE>我俩打了一架  就这样而已
<8-5,GRACE>We got in a fight. That was it.

262
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:50,010
<8-6,BECKETT>好吧  那解释一下这个
<8-6,BECKETT>Okay, okay. Then explain this.

263
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,490
<8-6,BECKETT>这条蓝色羊驼毛围巾是在你公寓里找到的
<8-6,BECKETT>This blue alpaca scarf was found at your apartment.

264
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:55,170
<8-6,BECKETT>跟艾拉被勒死后
<8-6,BECKETT>It's an exact match to the hairs

265
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:57,750
<8-6,BECKETT>颈部残留的毛发完全匹配
<8-6,BECKETT>found on ella's neck after she was strangled.

266
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,430
<8-7,GRACE>拜托  这围巾又不止我一个人有
<8-7,GRACE>Come on. Other people have that scarf.

267
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:01,060
<8-8,BECKETT>是的  但就你有杀人动机
<8-8,BECKETT>Yeah, but you're the only one with motive.

268
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:03,110
<8-9,GRACE>这围巾是《当代时尚》送的圣诞礼物
<8-9,GRACE>It was the Christmas gift from Modern Fashion.

269
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:04,580
<8-9,GRACE>每个人都有
<8-9,GRACE>We all got the scarf.

270
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:08,870
<8-9,GRACE>也许艾拉当时正围着  凶手就用来勒死了她
<8-9,GRACE>Maybe Ella was wearing hers and someone choked her with it.

271
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:12,610
<8-10,BECKETT>你凌晨12点到2点在哪  格蕾丝
<8-10,BECKETT>Where were you between 12:00 and 2:00 a.m., Grace?

272
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:13,910
<8-11,GRACE>我刚被炒鱿鱼
<8-11,GRACE>I'd just gotten fired.

273
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,710
<8-11,GRACE>几个朋友带我出去喝酒了
<8-11,GRACE>Some friends took me out and got me drunk.

274
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,460
<8-11,GRACE>-你可以问他们  -我会的
<8-11,GRACE>- You can ask them. - I will.

275
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:19,550
<8-12,BECKETT>同时  我们再说说艾拉的事
<8-12,BECKETT>In the meantime, let's talk about Ella.

276
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,080
<8-12,BECKETT>她室友觉得她最近工作上有点麻烦
<8-12,BECKETT>Her roommate thought that she was having trouble at the office.

277
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,750
<8-12,BECKETT>你跟她共事  知道是什么麻烦吗
<8-12,BECKETT>You worked with her. You know what it was?

278
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:27,610
<8-13,GRACE>好像是有点事
<8-13,GRACE>Actually, there was something else.

279
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,440
<8-13,GRACE>几天前  午餐时间
<8-13,GRACE>A few days ago, at lunchtime,

280
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:33,050
<8-13,GRACE>我看到她跟一个男人在公司大楼外面争执
<8-13,GRACE>I saw her arguing with this guy outside the building.

281
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:34,720
<8-14,BECKETT>你认得他吗
<8-14,BECKETT>Did you recognize him?

282
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:36,200
<8-15,GRACE>以前从没见过
<8-15,GRACE>I'd never seen him before.

283
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,270
<8-15,GRACE>但我听到他在威胁她
<8-15,GRACE>But I overheard them, and he was threatening her.

284
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,060
<8-15,GRACE>他说她手上有他要的东西
<8-15,GRACE>He said she had something he wanted

285
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,720
<8-15,GRACE>她必须交出来
<8-15,GRACE>and he wouldn't take no for an answer.

286
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,490
<8-16,BECKETT>-她什么反应  -她说他再来找她的话
<8-16,BECKETT>- And what was her reaction? - She said she was gonna call the police

287
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:47,330
<8-17,GRACE>就要报警  然后他就气冲冲地走了
<8-17,GRACE>if he didn't leave her the hell alone, and then he stormed off.

288
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,230
<8-17,GRACE>我问过她是怎么回事
<8-17,GRACE>I-I tried to ask her what it was all about,

289
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,150
<8-17,GRACE>但她不肯说
<8-17,GRACE>but she wouldn't tell me.

290
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,780
<8-18,BECKETT>你还记得他的样貌  能帮我们做素描画像吗
<8-18,BECKETT>Do you remember him well enough to help us with a sketch?

291
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,900
<8-19,GRACE>应该可以
<8-19,GRACE>I think so.

292
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:57,060
<9-1,BECKETT>这就是威胁艾拉的人
<9-1,BECKETT>Okay, this is the guy who threatened Ella.

293
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,600
<9-2,CASTLE>你相信格蕾丝的说法
<9-2,CASTLE>So, you believe Grace's story?

294
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,120
<9-3,BECKETT>她的不在场证明核实了
<9-3,BECKETT>Well, her alibi checks out.

295
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,360
<9-3,BECKETT>制服警员还找到两名目击者看到他跟艾拉争执
<9-3,BECKETT>And UNIS found two witnesses that saw him arguing with Ella.

296
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,880
<9-4,CASTLE>艾拉美其名是个助手
<9-4,CASTLE>Ella was basically a glorified assistant.

297
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,490
<9-4,CASTLE>能有什么是这个男人想要的呢
<9-4,CASTLE>What could she possibly have had that this man wanted?

298
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,600
<9-5,BECKETT>你想啊  卡塞尔
<9-5,BECKETT>Well, think about it, Castle.

299
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,390
<9-5,BECKETT>玛蒂尔达·金是时尚界最有影响力的人物
<9-5,BECKETT>Matilda King is the most influential person in fashion,

300
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:14,510
<9-5,BECKETT>艾拉跟她又有直接联系
<9-5,BECKETT>and Ella had direct access to her world.

301
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,090
<9-6,CASTLE>你是说这个人威胁艾拉
<9-6,CASTLE>So you're saying this man leveraged Ella

302
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:20,770
<9-6,CASTLE>来搞清楚下季裙边的走向
<9-6,CASTLE>to find out what direction hemlines are going next season?

303
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:23,290
<9-6,CASTLE>我刚想到了一个新标题
<9-6,CASTLE>I just came up with a new title.

304
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,530
<9-6,CASTLE>"谋杀正当时"
<9-6,CASTLE>"Murder is the new black."

305
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,660
<9-7,BECKETT>这话讲得通吗
<9-7,BECKETT>Does that even make sense?

306
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:29,300
<9-8,RYAN>讲不通  还有件说不通的事
<9-8,RYAN>No, it doesn't. And here's something else that doesn't make sense.

307
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:29,870
<9-9,BECKETT>你们在艾拉的公寓里
<9-9,BECKETT>Did you guys find something

308
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:31,640
<9-10,RYAN>-发现了什么吗  -可以这么说
<9-10,RYAN>- at Ella's apartment? - You could say that.

309
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,650
<9-10,RYAN>我用座机的时候
<9-10,RYAN>I went to use the landline,

310
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,760
<9-10,RYAN>注意到靠近灯的位置有干扰音
<9-10,RYAN>and I noticed some static when I got near a lamp.

311
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,850
<9-11,ESPOSITO>把灯拆开之后  瞧我们发现了什么
<9-11,ESPOSITO>When we popped that lamp open, look what we found inside.

312
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:37,880
<9-12,BECKETT>窃听器
<9-12,BECKETT>A bug?

313
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,530
<9-12,BECKETT>为什么有人会窃听艾拉的公寓
<9-12,BECKETT>Why would someone bug Ella's apartment?

314
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:43,600
<9-13,CASTLE>因为她是"尼基塔女郎"
<9-13,CASTLE>Because... she is "La Femme Nikita",

315
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,370
<9-13,CASTLE>她在《当代时尚》的工作只是伪装身份
<9-13,CASTLE>and her job at Modern Fashion is just a cover.

316
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:47,570
<9-14,BECKETT>她不是"尼基塔女郎"
<9-14,BECKETT>She's not "La Femme Nikita."

317
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:51,590
<9-15,CASTLE>窃听  来自神秘人的威胁  谋杀
<9-15,CASTLE>Still, wiretaps, threats from mysterious men, murder --

318
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,540
<9-15,CASTLE>发生的一切  牵扯到的不止是时尚
<9-15,CASTLE>Whatever's going on here, it's bigger than fashion.

319
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,110
<9-16,BECKETT>查查看能不能找到序列号
<9-16,BECKETT>Okay, see if you can get a serial number.

320
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:57,020
<9-16,BECKETT>查出这个窃听器是谁买的
<9-16,BECKETT>Let's figure out who bought that bug.

321
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,910
<10-1,CASTLE>好的  非常感谢
<10-1,CASTLE>All right. Thank you very much.

322
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:04,270
<10-1,CASTLE>是科尔多瓦宅邸的活动策划人打来的
<10-1,CASTLE>That was the event planner at the Cordova House.

323
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,750
<10-1,CASTLE>他们说秋天还有可预订的日子
<10-1,CASTLE>They said they still have a few spots open in the fall.

324
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,260
<10-1,CASTLE>今晚她可以带我们参观一下
<10-1,CASTLE>She can give us a tour tonight.

325
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,700
<10-2,BECKETT>那就这么定了
<10-2,BECKETT>Whoo-hoo! Let's do it.

326
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:13,640
<10-3,CASTLE>-水门事件进展如何了  -事情越发复杂了
<10-3,CASTLE>- So, where are we on watergate? - So, the plot thickens.

327
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,550
<10-4,BECKETT>艾拉公寓的楼管
<10-4,BECKETT>The building manager at Ella's apartment

328
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:18,560
<10-4,BECKETT>记得一个月前放进去过一个灭虫员
<10-4,BECKETT>remembers letting an exterminator into her place about a month ago.

329
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,700
<10-5,CASTLE>通常来说  灭虫员清理虫子[双关]
<10-5,CASTLE>Usually, exterminators get rid of bugs.

330
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,490
<10-6,BECKETT>但这位却不然
<10-6,BECKETT>Only this one didn't.

331
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:24,870
<10-6,BECKETT>他所在的公司并不存在
<10-6,BECKETT>The company that he worked for doesn't exist.

332
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,450
<10-6,BECKETT>这都是为了什么呢  卡塞尔
<10-6,BECKETT>I mean, what is this about, Castle?

333
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:28,150
<10-6,BECKETT>为什么有人会把艾拉作为目标
<10-6,BECKETT>Why would someone target Ella?

334
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:30,140
<10-7,CASTLE>我说了但你驳回了我的理论
<10-7,CASTLE>Well, you already heard and rejected my theory.

335
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:32,510
<10-8,BECKETT>但你的理论并不能解释
<10-8,BECKETT>Yeah, but your theory doesn't explain the little detail

336
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:34,140
<10-8,BECKETT>蕾妮发现的细节
<10-8,BECKETT>that Lanie just found out.

337
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,950
<10-8,BECKETT>艾拉鞋底沾着黑珊瑚
<10-8,BECKETT>There's black coral on the sole of Ella's shoe,

338
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:38,660
<10-8,BECKETT>黑珊瑚不是垃圾箱里的
<10-8,BECKETT>and it wasn't from the dumpster.

339
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,770
<10-9,CASTLE>这说不通啊
<10-9,CASTLE>Well, that doesn't make any sense.

340
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:41,180
<10-9,CASTLE>黑珊瑚是热带地区的
<10-9,CASTLE>Black coral is found in the tropics.

341
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:43,200
<10-10,BECKETT>正是如此  这东西怎么会粘到她鞋上
<10-10,BECKETT>Exactly. So how did this end up on her shoe?

342
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,280
<10-11,ESPOSITO>-贝克特  -加上卡塞尔
<10-11,ESPOSITO>- Yo, Beckett. - And Castle.

343
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:46,460
<10-12,CASTLE>好吧
<10-12,CASTLE>Sure.

344
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,030
<10-13,ESPOSITO>序列号上没有发现
<10-13,ESPOSITO>So, no look on the serial number

345
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:50,460
<10-13,ESPOSITO>但对犯罪现场排查后有了重大发现
<10-13,ESPOSITO>but we got a hit off the canvass of the crime scene.

346
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:53,180
<10-13,ESPOSITO>一个女裁缝下了夜班后看到街角有个人
<10-13,ESPOSITO>A seamstress coming off the late shift saw a guy wait on the corner

347
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,630
<10-13,ESPOSITO>就等在艾拉被害的小巷子旁
<10-13,ESPOSITO>right near the alley where Ella was killed.

348
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:55,630
<10-14,BECKETT>知道他长相了吗
<10-14,BECKETT>We get a description?

349
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,310
<10-15,ESPOSITO>嗯  和画像相符
<10-15,ESPOSITO>Yeah, and he matches our sketch.

350
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:00,360
<11-1,TERESA GOMEZ>对  就是他
<11-1,TERESA GOMEZ>Yes. That's him.

351
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:01,550
<11-1,TERESA GOMEZ>我路过时
<11-1,TERESA GOMEZ>He was standing by the alley

352
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,780
<11-1,TERESA GOMEZ>他就站在百老汇咖啡店外的小巷里
<11-1,TERESA GOMEZ>outside the broadway coffee shop when I walked by.

353
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:04,870
<11-2,BECKETT>那时候几点
<11-2,BECKETT>And what time was this?

354
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:06,120
<11-3,TERESA>刚过午夜
<11-3,TERESA>Just after midnight.

355
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,650
<11-4,CASTLE>你还记得他多高吗  穿着怎样
<11-4,CASTLE>Do you recall how tall he was, what he wore?

356
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,390
<11-5,TERESA>我就是搞面料的
<11-5,TERESA>Fabric is my business.

357
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:13,810
<11-5,TERESA>他穿了件深色西装  高品质羊毛混纺的
<11-5,TERESA>He wore a dark suit -- nice quality, wool blend.

358
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:16,500
<11-5,TERESA>还戴了条显眼的条纹领带
<11-5,TERESA>Oh, and he had a distinctive striped tie --

359
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:20,020
<11-5,TERESA>深红和深蓝色条纹上有金色三角形交叉
<11-5,TERESA>crimson and navy with gold triangles across the stripes.

360
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,420
<11-6,BECKETT>像是俱乐部的领带
<11-6,BECKETT>That sounds like a club tie.

361
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,280
<11-7,CASTLE>深红和深蓝色  我知道那个
<11-7,CASTLE>Crimson and navy -- yes, I know that one.

362
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,110
<11-7,CASTLE>金色三角形  那是卡尔顿俱乐部的领带
<11-7,CASTLE>Gold triangles. That's the Carlton Club tie.

363
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:26,990
<11-7,CASTLE>如果我们能把画像
<11-7,CASTLE>If we can match that

364
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:28,960
<11-7,CASTLE>去和他们的会员配对  就能知道他身份了
<11-7,CASTLE>sketch to one of its members, we got our I.D.

365
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,860
<11-8,BECKETT>但是那样的俱乐部
<11-8,BECKETT>Yeah, except clubs like that

366
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:32,940
<11-8,BECKETT>出了名地保护会员隐私
<11-8,BECKETT>are notoriously protective of keeping their members' privacy.

367
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:35,070
<11-8,BECKETT>他们不会交出信息的
<11-8,BECKETT>They're not just gonna hand over that information.

368
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:38,760
<11-9,CASTLE>俱乐部不会  但是会员可以
<11-9,CASTLE>The club won't, no, but one of its members might.

369
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:43,680
<12-1,CASTLE>经过艰苦的谈判  和尼克斯队球票的利诱
<12-1,CASTLE>After a tough negotiation that involved my Knicks tickets

370
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,190
<12-1,CASTLE>外加我下本书里以他祖母冠名一个角色
<12-1,CASTLE>and naming a character in my next book after his nana,

371
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,250
<12-1,CASTLE>我朋友终于给了我这个名字  马库斯·康维
<12-1,CASTLE>my friend came up with a name -- Marcus Conway.

372
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,600
<12-2,BECKETT>我们掌握他什么情况
<12-2,BECKETT>Okay, so, what do we know about him?

373
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,250
<12-3,CASTLE>他是凯勒曼·古德菲尔德律所的一名律师
<12-3,CASTLE>He is a lawyer at Kellerman Goodfriend.

374
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,490
<12-4,BECKETT>那是市里最大的律所之一啊
<12-4,BECKETT>That's one of the city's biggest law firms.

375
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,880
<12-4,BECKETT>为什么一个高端律师会对艾拉紧追不放呢
<12-4,BECKETT>Why is a high-powered lawyer going after Ella?

376
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,130
<12-5,ESPOSITO>可能与她的工作有关
<12-5,ESPOSITO>Maybe it has to do with her work.

377
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,760
<12-5,ESPOSITO>原来马库斯·康维
<12-5,ESPOSITO>Turns out that Marcus Conway

378
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,860
<12-5,ESPOSITO>是《小妞女装》杂志的总法律顾问
<12-5,ESPOSITO>is general counsel for Couture Chick Magazine.

379
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,580
<12-6,CASTLE>是《时尚女装》  你肯定不知道
<12-6,CASTLE>That's "Chic", and not that you would know,

380
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:07,540
<12-6,CASTLE>但他们是《当代时尚》最强的竞争者
<12-6,CASTLE>but they are Modern Fashion's biggest competitor.

381
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,630
<12-7,BECKETT>联系康维的律所  我要知道他在哪
<12-7,BECKETT>Call Conway's firm. I want to know where he is.

382
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:13,280
<13-1,MARCUS CONWAY>警探  做出这种指控之前
<13-1,MARCUS CONWAY>Detective, I would think very carefully

383
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,130
<13-1,MARCUS CONWAY>你得仔细考虑一下
<13-1,MARCUS CONWAY>before making these kinds of accusations.

384
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:18,180
<13-2,BECKETT>康维先生  我没有做出任何指控
<13-2,BECKETT>Mr. Conway, I am not making any accusations.

385
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,110
<13-2,BECKETT>我只是简单地陈述事实
<13-2,BECKETT>I am simply stating fact.

386
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,520
<13-2,BECKETT>有目击者听到你威胁艾拉·海因斯
<13-2,BECKETT>We have a witness that heard you threatening Ella Hayes

387
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,870
<13-2,BECKETT>还有人看到你出现在她被害地点附近
<13-2,BECKETT>and another one that saw you near where she was killed.

388
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:26,860
<13-3,CASTLE>刚好是她遇害的时间
<13-3,CASTLE>Right about the same time she ended up that way.

389
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,480
<13-4,BECKETT>你得解释一下
<13-4,BECKETT>You need to explain yourself.

390
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,380
<13-5,GLORIA ROBBINS>马库斯  我听说警察来了
<13-5,GLORIA ROBBINS>Marcus, I heard the police are here.

391
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,700
<13-5,GLORIA ROBBINS>发生了什么事
<13-5,GLORIA ROBBINS>What's going on?

392
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,620
<13-6,BECKETT>你是谁
<13-6,BECKETT>Who are you?

393
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:33,620
<13-7,GLORIA>葛洛丽亚·罗宾斯
<13-7,GLORIA>Gloria Robins.

394
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,390
<13-7,GLORIA>我是《时尚女装》的主编
<13-7,GLORIA>I'm editor-in-chief of Couture Chic.

395
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:37,330
<13-8,CONWAY>他们认为我杀了艾拉·海因斯
<13-8,CONWAY>They think I murdered Ella Hayes.

396
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:38,700
<13-9,GLORIA>什么  太荒谬了
<13-9,GLORIA>What? That's ridiculous.

397
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:40,040
<13-10,BECKETT>你知道她是谁
<13-10,BECKETT>So you know who she is?

398
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,390
<13-11,GLORIA>-这显然是个大误会  -那就解释清楚
<13-11,GLORIA>- This is obviously one huge misunderstanding. - Then clear it up.

399
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:45,220
<13-12,BECKETT>告诉我你对艾拉·海因斯的了解
<13-12,BECKETT>Tell me what you know about Ella Hayes.

400
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,890
<13-13,CONWAY>我们接近艾拉并试图
<13-13,CONWAY>We approached Ella and attempted to...

401
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:51,950
<13-13,CONWAY>将她招入麾下
<13-13,CONWAY>engage her services.

402
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,650
<13-14,BECKETT>那就是说你们想雇她
<13-14,BECKETT>So, basically, you tried to hire her

403
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:56,340
<13-14,BECKETT>以获取《当代时尚》的内部信息
<13-14,BECKETT>to get inside information on Modern Fashion.

404
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,460
<13-15,CONWAY>-我没那么说  -但她肯定是这么理解的
<13-15,CONWAY>- I wouldn't put it that way. - Well, I'm pretty sure she would,

405
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,790
<13-16,BECKETT>所以她拒绝了你
<13-16,BECKETT>which is why she turned you down.

406
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,180
<13-17,CASTLE>但是你却不接受拒绝
<13-17,CASTLE>And you wouldn't take no for an answer.

407
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,700
<13-18,CONWAY>我们这行竞争很激烈的
<13-18,CONWAY>Look, this is a competitive business

408
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,450
<13-18,CONWAY>谁都想抢占先机
<13-18,CONWAY>with everyone looking to get an edge.

409
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:06,370
<13-18,CONWAY>没错  我确实着急想达成交易
<13-18,CONWAY>Yes, I was aggressive in trying to make a deal,

410
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:07,890
<13-18,CONWAY>但我接受了她的拒绝
<13-18,CONWAY>but when she refused and I accepted that,

411
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:09,310
<13-18,CONWAY>再没和她联系
<13-18,CONWAY>and I never contacted her again.

412
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:11,360
<13-19,BECKETT>那你能解释一下在死亡时间前后
<13-19,BECKETT>Then why were you less than a block away

413
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,170
<13-19,BECKETT>你恰好在案发现场的事实吗
<13-19,BECKETT>from where she was killed at about the time she died?

414
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:16,220
<13-20,CONWAY>是她给我打的电话
<13-20,CONWAY>Because she called me.

415
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:17,910
<13-20,CONWAY>她昨晚约我见面
<13-20,CONWAY>She asked me to meet her last night.

416
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,150
<13-21,BECKETT>为什么
<13-21,BECKETT>Why would she do that?

417
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:21,490
<13-22,CONWAY>可能是因为玛蒂尔达炒了她吧
<13-22,CONWAY>Probably because matilda just fired her.

418
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,060
<13-22,CONWAY>总之  她说她有
<13-22,CONWAY>The bottom line is, she said she had

419
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:25,240
<13-22,CONWAY>《当代时尚》的爆炸性内幕
<13-22,CONWAY>bombshell information on Modern Fashion --

420
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,330
<13-22,CONWAY>一旦爆料  一定能毁掉《当代时尚》
<13-22,CONWAY>information that, if it got out, it would destroy the magazine.

421
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:36,210
<14-1,BECKETT>康维先生  我查看了艾拉的通话记录
<14-1,BECKETT>Mr. Conway, I took a look at Ella's cellphone records,

422
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:38,500
<14-1,BECKETT>她昨晚没有给你打过电话
<14-1,BECKETT>she never called you last night.

423
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,640
<14-2,CONWAY>她打了  我可以证明
<14-2,CONWAY>She did call, and I can prove it.

424
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,280
<14-2,CONWAY>她还给我留言了
<14-2,CONWAY>She left me a message.

425
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:43,920
<14-2,CONWAY>我是艾拉
<14-2,CONWAY>Hey, it's Ella.

426
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,590
<14-3,ELLA>你的提议我接受了
<14-3,ELLA>I changed my mind about your offer.

427
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:47,120
<14-3,ELLA>我有可以毁掉
<14-3,ELLA>I found out something,

428
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:48,810
<14-3,ELLA>《当代时尚》的消息
<14-3,ELLA>something that'll ruin Modern Fashion,

429
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:50,560
<14-3,ELLA>让它一败涂地
<14-3,ELLA>take down the whole operation.

430
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:52,650
<14-3,ELLA>一小时后百老汇咖啡店见
<14-3,ELLA>Meet me at the Broadway coffee shop in an hour.

431
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:53,740
<14-3,ELLA>我等你
<14-3,ELLA>I'll see you there.

432
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,990
<14-4,CONWAY>我等了她两个小时  可她一直没露面
<14-4,CONWAY>I waited around for two hours, but she never showed.

433
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:57,730
<14-5,BECKETT>她掌握了什么信息
<14-5,BECKETT>What information did she want to share?

434
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:00,540
<14-6,CONWAY>我也想知道  可我毫无头绪
<14-6,CONWAY>Believe me I would love to know, but I have the faintest idea.

435
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,510
<14-7,CASTLE>你雇她找的是什么消息
<14-7,CASTLE>What were you trying to hire her to find out?

436
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:04,210
<14-8,GLORIA>你也许听说了
<14-8,GLORIA>As you may have heard,

437
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:07,110
<14-8,GLORIA>一个叫格伦·卡特的高科技投资商
<14-8,GLORIA>a tech-venture capitalist named Glen Carter

438
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:09,150
<14-8,GLORIA>上个月买下了《当代时尚》
<14-8,GLORIA>bought Modern Fashion last month.

439
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:12,990
<14-8,GLORIA>格伦计划把玛蒂尔达的宝贝杂志
<14-8,GLORIA>Glen has big plans to drag Matilda's precious little magazine

440
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:14,400
<14-8,GLORIA>带进数码时代
<14-8,GLORIA>into the digital age.

441
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,330
<14-9,CASTLE>-计划内容是  -那也是我们想知道的
<14-9,CASTLE>- Which are? - Well, that's what we wanted to know,

442
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:20,140
<14-10,GLORIA>因为我们网站的网上销售没能带来更多营业额
<14-10,GLORIA>Since our website has failed to generate new subscription business.

443
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:22,630
<14-10,GLORIA>所以如果能得到《当代时尚》的新计划
<14-10,GLORIA>If we could get Modern Fashion's new playbook,

444
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:26,310
<14-10,GLORIA>我们就能改进战略  抢占先机
<14-10,GLORIA>It could help us strategize and stay one step ahead.

445
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:28,080
<14-11,BECKETT>所以  你想让艾拉帮忙
<14-11,BECKETT>So, you wanted to hire Ella

446
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,570
<14-11,BECKETT>让她告诉你们
<14-11,BECKETT>so that she could tell you about

447
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:31,780
<14-11,BECKETT>《当代时尚》的新方向
<14-11,BECKETT>the new direction the magazine was taking,

448
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:32,970
<14-11,BECKETT>她拒绝了
<14-11,BECKETT>and when she turned you down,

449
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,900
<14-11,BECKETT>你们就只说了这些
<14-11,BECKETT>that was the extent of your contact?

450
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,520
<14-12,CONWAY>直到她昨晚来电话
<14-12,CONWAY>Until she called last night.

451
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:38,390
<14-13,CASTLE>那窃听器又是怎么回事
<14-13,CASTLE>And what about the eavesdropping?

452
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,700
<14-14,CONWAY>你在说什么
<14-14,CONWAY>W-what are you talking about?

453
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,240
<14-15,BECKETT>我们在艾拉的公寓找到了一个窃听器
<14-15,BECKETT>We found a listening device in Ella's apartment.

454
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:47,070
<14-16,GLORIA>不是我们干的  与我们无关
<14-16,GLORIA>That wasn't us. We had nothing to do with that.

455
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:48,920
<15-1,BECKETT>这就是我们为什么
<15-1,BECKETT>So, these records explain why

456
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,400
<15-1,BECKETT>没找到艾拉和马库斯·康维的通话记录
<15-1,BECKETT>we missed Ella's phone calls to Marcus Conway.

457
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:53,830
<15-1,BECKETT>她是用室友的座机和他联系的
<15-1,BECKETT>She phoned him using her roommate's landline.

458
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:57,050
<15-1,BECKETT>她约康维一小时后在咖啡店见面
<15-1,BECKETT>So, she told Conway to meet her in the coffee shop in an hour.

459
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:59,310
<15-1,BECKETT>她公寓离那儿只有20分钟的路程
<15-1,BECKETT>It would take her about 20 minutes to get there from her apartment,

460
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:01,240
<15-1,BECKETT>她一定是赴约的路上被杀的
<15-1,BECKETT>So she must have been killed on the way there.

461
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:03,240
<15-2,CASTLE>好遗憾
<15-2,CASTLE>That's a real shame.

462
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:06,000
<15-2,CASTLE>瞧瞧她的设计  她其实很有天赋
<15-2,CASTLE>Looking at her designs, Ella actually had talent.

463
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,380
<15-3,BECKETT>问题在于  她到底知道了什么
<15-3,BECKETT>Yeah, well, the question is, what did she know,

464
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,470
<15-3,BECKETT>凶手杀她是不是为了灭口
<15-3,BECKETT>and did someone kill her to keep her quiet?

465
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:12,460
<15-4,RYAN>这我不知道
<15-4,RYAN>Well, I can't help you out there,

466
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,890
<15-4,RYAN>我知道的是  在放置窃听器这事上
<15-4,RYAN>but I can tell you that Marcus Conway

467
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:17,510
<15-4,RYAN>马库斯·康维确实是清白的
<15-4,RYAN>was telling the truth about not planting that bug.

468
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:18,900
<15-5,ESPOSITO>窃听器的序列号显示它来自皇后区一家叫
<15-5,ESPOSITO>Yeah, the serial number led us to a distributor

469
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,680
<15-5,ESPOSITO>交替情报的经销商
<15-5,ESPOSITO>named Alternate Intelligence in Queens.

470
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,720
<15-6,BECKETT>他们知道买主是谁吗
<15-6,BECKETT>Do they know who brought it?

471
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,380
<15-7,RYAN>一个月前詹姆斯·卡瓦纳用信用卡
<15-7,RYAN>James kavanaugh paid for that listening device

472
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,130
<15-7,RYAN>购买了那个窃听器
<15-7,RYAN>with a credit card a month ago.

473
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,760
<15-8,CASTLE>重点在于什么
<15-8,CASTLE>And when does it get interesting?

474
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,040
<15-9,ESPOSITO>在于他不仅是前特种部队成员
<15-9,ESPOSITO>When we found out he was former special forces and,

475
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,560
<15-9,ESPOSITO>还是现任《当代时尚》的保安队长
<15-9,ESPOSITO>not to mention, the head of security at Modern Fashion.

476
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,900
<15-10,BECKETT>等等  艾拉是被她自己的公司监视了
<15-10,BECKETT>Wait a minute -- Ella was being spied on by her own magazine?

477
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:39,890
<15-11,CASTLE>贝克特  我们约了去看科尔多瓦宅邸的场馆
<15-11,CASTLE>Oh, Beckett, we have that appointment at the Cordova House.

478
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:41,740
<15-12,BECKETT>卡塞尔  抱歉  我有任务在身
<15-12,BECKETT>Oh, Castle, I'm sorry. Duty calls.

479
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,590
<15-12,BECKETT>你自己去行吗
<15-12,BECKETT>Can -- can you go without me

480
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:45,620
<15-12,BECKETT>看看是否和照片一样漂亮
<15-12,BECKETT>and see if it's as good as the pictures?

481
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,150
<15-13,CASTLE>你信任我的判断吗
<15-13,CASTLE>You trust me to make this decision on my own?

482
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:49,470
<15-14,BECKETT>那还是带上玛莎吧
<15-14,BECKETT>Can you go with Martha?

483
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,850
<15-15,BECKETT>我们得传讯詹姆斯·卡瓦纳
<15-15,BECKETT>We have to bring James Kavanaugh in.

484
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,890
<15-16,RYAN>收到
<15-16,RYAN>Yeah.

485
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:00,000
<16-1,JAMES KAVANAUGH>我是保安  当然会有相关设备
<16-1,JAMES KAVANAUGH>I'm in the security business. I buy lots of equipment.

486
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,280
<16-2,ESPOSITO>我们在意的是你安装在
<16-2,ESPOSITO>Yeah, well, this equipment was a listening device

487
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:04,560
<16-2,ESPOSITO>艾拉·海因斯公寓的那个窃听器
<16-2,ESPOSITO>that you installed in Ella Hayes' apartment.

488
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:07,190
<16-3,KAVANAUGH>那不是我装的
<16-3,KAVANAUGH>If you think that, you're mistaken.

489
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:09,670
<16-4,BECKETT>是吗  可我们给艾拉公寓的楼管
<16-4,BECKETT>Really, because we showed your picture

490
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:12,580
<16-4,BECKETT>看你的照片后  他指认你就是那个
<16-4,BECKETT>to the super at Ella's building, and he identified you

491
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:15,650
<16-4,BECKETT>进过她公寓的灭虫员
<16-4,BECKETT>as the exterminator he let into her apartment.

492
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:18,690
<16-5,KAVANAUGH>艾拉·海因斯的死和我无关
<16-5,KAVANAUGH>I had nothing to do with what happened to Ella Hayes.

493
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:21,230
<16-6,BECKETT>你擅闯她的房间  安装了窃听器
<16-6,BECKETT>You broke into her place, you wired it for sound,

494
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,780
<16-6,BECKETT>现在她死了  还说与你无关
<16-6,BECKETT>and now she's dead?

495
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:23,730
<16-6,BECKETT>詹姆斯
<16-6,BECKETT>James?

496
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,670
<16-7,ESPOSITO>你自己觉得别人会怎么想
<16-7,ESPOSITO>Think about how that looks, bro.

497
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,360
<16-8,BECKETT>你最好把知道的都交代清楚
<16-8,BECKETT>Your best bet is to tell us exactly what you know.

498
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:32,580
<16-9,KAVANAUGH>我只安装了窃听器  没别的了
<16-9,KAVANAUGH>All I did was bug her place, okay?

499
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:36,170
<16-9,KAVANAUGH>格伦·卡特买下杂志之后
<16-9,KAVANAUGH>I mean, once Glen Carter bought the magazine,

500
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:39,120
<16-9,KAVANAUGH>家庭监听就成了惯例
<16-9,KAVANAUGH>home monitoring got to be a common practice.

501
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,920
<16-10,BECKETT>这么说是格伦·卡特要求设监听的吗
<16-10,BECKETT>So, Glen Carter ordered the surveillance?

502
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,140
<16-11,KAVANAUGH>不  他并不知道这事
<16-11,KAVANAUGH>No, he didn't know anything about it.

503
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,680
<16-11,KAVANAUGH>是玛蒂尔达·金要求的
<16-11,KAVANAUGH>It was ordered by Matilda King.

504
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,680
<16-11,KAVANAUGH>玛蒂尔达·金
<16-11,KAVANAUGH>Matilda king.

505
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,300
<16-12,BECKETT>-你确定吗  -当然  千真万确
<16-12,BECKETT>- You sure about that? - Yes, I'm sure.

506
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:56,200
<16-13,KAVANAUGH>她害怕有人要抢了她的饭碗
<16-13,KAVANAUGH>She got all freaked out about someone coming after her job,

507
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:58,930
<16-13,KAVANAUGH>所以她说再也不知道该相信谁
<16-13,KAVANAUGH>so she said she didn't know who she could trust anymore.

508
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:02,030
<16-14,ESPOSITO>好  那谁负责监听艾拉的公寓呢
<16-14,ESPOSITO>Okay, so, who monitored the audio from Ella's apartment?

509
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,840
<16-15,KAVANAUGH>玛蒂尔达让我装好设备
<16-15,KAVANAUGH>Matilda had me set it up

510
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,080
<16-15,KAVANAUGH>所有音频都直接传到她的电脑
<16-15,KAVANAUGH>so that it fed directly to her computer.

511
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,720
<16-16,ESPOSITO>你知道这说明什么吗
<16-16,ESPOSITO>You realize what this means?

512
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,400
<16-17,BECKETT>艾拉用座机打给马库斯·康维
<16-17,BECKETT>Ella called Marcus Conway on the landline,

513
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,830
<16-17,BECKETT>说她能击垮《当代时尚》
<16-17,BECKETT>told him she could take down the magazine,

514
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:18,570
<16-17,BECKETT>而这些话都被玛蒂尔达听到了
<16-17,BECKETT>and Matilda heard the whole thing.

515
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:20,000
<17-1,RYAN>好的  非常感谢
<17-1,RYAN>Okay. Thank you very much.

516
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,070
<17-1,RYAN>《当代时尚》大楼的大堂保安
<17-1,RYAN>So, the guard in the lobby of the Modern Fashion building

517
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:26,730
<17-1,RYAN>看到玛蒂尔达昨晚11点30离开
<17-1,RYAN>saw Matilda leave there last night at 11:30,

518
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:28,240
<17-1,RYAN>她走得很匆忙
<17-1,RYAN>and she was in a big hurry.

519
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,320
<17-2,ESPOSITO>11点30么
<17-2,ESPOSITO>11:30?

520
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:32,140
<17-2,ESPOSITO>正好是艾拉打电话给马库斯·康维之后
<17-2,ESPOSITO>Well, that's right after Ella called Marcus Conway.

521
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,230
<17-2,ESPOSITO>玛蒂尔达知道艾拉要去告密
<17-2,ESPOSITO>Matilda knew that Ella was about to spill the beans

522
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,580
<17-2,ESPOSITO>击垮《当代时尚》
<17-2,ESPOSITO>and bring down the magazine.

523
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:37,790
<17-3,BECKETT>于是玛蒂尔达去阻止她了
<17-3,BECKETT>So Matilda went to stop her.

524
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,020
<17-3,BECKETT>她就是凶手
<17-3,BECKETT>She's our killer.

525
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,880
<18-1,CARRIE>等等等等  她正在打电话
<18-1,CARRIE>Wait, wait, wait. She's on a call.

526
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,990
<18-1,CARRIE>她可以回电
<18-1,CARRIE>She can call back.

527
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:59,300
<18-1,CARRIE>格伦  这杂志并不只是推特转发或脸书点赞
<18-1,CARRIE>Glen, this magazine is not about tweets or likes on facebook,

528
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,500
<18-1,CARRIE>我的天呐
<18-1,CARRIE>for god's sake!

529
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,920
<19-1,MATILDA>57年来
<19-1,MATILDA>For 57 years,

530
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:05,450
<19-1,MATILDA>女性买这本杂志都是为了时尚
<19-1,MATILDA>women have been purchasing this magazine for the fashion!

531
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:06,450
<19-2,GLENN CARTER>玛蒂尔达  冷静
<19-2,GLENN CARTER>Matilda, please.

532
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:09,760
<19-3,MATILDA>她们工作不顺心  生活不如意时
<19-3,MATILDA>Whenever they've had a bad day at work or at home,

533
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,800
<19-3,MATILDA>她们想到的总是我们
<19-3,MATILDA>they've come to us!

534
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,960
<19-3,MATILDA>我们让她们逃脱现实  给她们梦幻
<19-3,MATILDA>We are their escape! We are their fantasy!

535
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:16,810
<19-3,MATILDA>把七零八落的生活拼凑起来的是时装
<19-3,MATILDA>It's the clothing that stitches it all together.

536
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:18,580
<19-3,MATILDA>这才是最重要的
<19-3,MATILDA>That's what matters.

537
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,890
<19-4,GLENN CARTER>-没什么可说了  -格伦
<19-4,GLENN CARTER>- We're done here. - Glen!

538
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:23,550
<19-4,GLENN CARTER>格伦
<19-4,GLENN CARTER>Glen!

539
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,350
<19-6,MATILDA>抱歉  没看到你在那
<19-6,MATILDA>Oh. I'm sorry. I didn't see you there.

540
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,120
<19-7,BECKETT>金女士  你脾气不小啊
<19-7,BECKETT>You've got a hell of a temper, Ms. King.

541
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,500
<19-8,MATILDA>这不是脾气
<19-8,MATILDA>It's not temper.

542
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,940
<19-8,MATILDA>这是挫败
<19-8,MATILDA>It's frustration.

543
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,320
<19-8,MATILDA>我们的新老板格伦·卡特
<19-8,MATILDA>Glen Carter, our new owner,

544
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,420
<19-8,MATILDA>关心的不是时尚而是金钱
<19-8,MATILDA>cares more about money than fashion.

545
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:45,830
<19-9,BECKETT>就因为这个  所以你疑心他会把你换掉吗
<19-9,BECKETT>Is that why you were paranoid he was gonna replace you?

546
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,470
<19-10,MATILDA>我不知道你听说了什么  但我可是玛蒂尔达·金
<19-10,MATILDA>I don't know what you've heard, but I'm Matilda King.

547
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,490
<19-10,MATILDA>我代表这本杂志
<19-10,MATILDA>My name is synonymous with this magazine.

548
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,280
<19-10,MATILDA>他不敢把我换掉的
<19-10,MATILDA>He wouldn't dare replace me.

549
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,230
<19-11,BECKETT>那为什么他买下杂志的时候
<19-11,BECKETT>So then why did you order the monitoring

550
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:01,660
<19-11,BECKETT>你要下令监听
<19-11,BECKETT>of all of your employees' conversations

551
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:04,360
<19-11,BECKETT>你员工的所有对话呢
<19-11,BECKETT>the moment that he bought the magazine?

552
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:08,960
<19-12,MATILDA>确实瞒不过你
<19-12,MATILDA>You are quite the detective.

553
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,940
<19-12,MATILDA>请坐
<19-12,MATILDA>Take a seat.

554
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:17,240
<19-12,MATILDA>从杂志被收购开始  谣言便四起
<19-12,MATILDA>Yes, since the purchase, rumors have been swirling.

555
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:19,790
<19-12,MATILDA>我也想单纯认为它们只是谣言
<19-12,MATILDA>I'd like to think that they're just rumors,

556
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:21,850
<19-12,MATILDA>但我冒不起险
<19-12,MATILDA>but I can't afford to take that chance.

557
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,720
<19-12,MATILDA>我得确认我的手下绝对忠诚
<19-12,MATILDA>I need to know my people are loyal.

558
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,860
<19-13,BECKETT>通过窃听他们住所吗
<19-13,BECKETT>By bugging their homes?

559
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,520
<19-14,MATILDA>是经过他们许可的
<19-14,MATILDA>With their permission.

560
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,750
<19-14,MATILDA>我们曾有过类似状况发生
<19-14,MATILDA>We've had some loyalty issues,

561
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,060
<19-14,MATILDA>所以我的律师们在雇佣协议上
<19-14,MATILDA>so my lawyers added some fine print

562
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,870
<19-14,MATILDA>增添了些附属细则
<19-14,MATILDA>to their employment agreements.

563
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,760
<19-15,BECKETT>你真的认为这样就能在法庭上脱罪吗
<19-15,BECKETT>Do you actually believe that's gonna fly in court?

564
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:44,340
<19-16,MATILDA>我的律师们是这样想的
<19-16,MATILDA>My lawyers seem to think so.

565
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:48,330
<19-16,MATILDA>告诉我  这些和你的调查有什么关系
<19-16,MATILDA>Now, what does this have to do with your investigation?

566
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:50,500
<19-17,BECKETT>鉴于你要被换掉的谣言
<19-17,BECKETT>Look, given the rumors about your job,

567
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,630
<19-17,BECKETT>当你发现艾拉把不利于《当代时尚》的情报带给对手后
<19-17,BECKETT>it must have been disconcerting to find out Ella

568
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:56,450
<19-17,BECKETT>一定非常不安吧
<19-17,BECKETT>was taking damaging information on Modern Fashion to the competition.

569
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:59,100
<19-18,MATILDA>你指的是什么
<19-18,MATILDA>To what are you referring? What information?

570
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,060
<19-18,MATILDA>我们还不清楚
<19-18,MATILDA>We don't know that.

571
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,440
<19-19,BECKETT>我们只知道就在她安排好
<19-19,BECKETT>But what we do know is moments after she made the arrangements

572
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,880
<19-19,BECKETT>要卖出那份情报后
<19-19,BECKETT>to sell that information,

573
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,190
<19-19,BECKETT>有人看到你跑出去
<19-19,BECKETT>you were seen running out of here.

574
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:14,530
<19-20,MATILDA>你认为我跑出去是去谋杀艾拉吗
<19-20,MATILDA>You think that I ran out of here to kill Ella?

575
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,560
<19-21,BECKETT>你的安全主管说你下令安装监听设备
<19-21,BECKETT>Your head of security says that you're set up

576
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:19,580
<19-21,BECKETT>是要在你的电脑上即时听到录音
<19-21,BECKETT>to listen to these recordings live on your computer.

577
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:21,240
<19-22,MATILDA>我到周末才听
<19-22,MATILDA>Something I do on the weekend.

578
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,680
<19-22,MATILDA>平日里要管理杂志  事务繁忙
<19-22,MATILDA>I'm a little busy running a magazine during the week.

579
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,690
<19-23,BECKETT>对  这职位你急切地想要保住
<19-23,BECKETT>Yeah, a position that you're desperate to defend.

580
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,710
<19-23,BECKETT>这就是作案动机和作案时机
<19-23,BECKETT>That's motive and that's opportunity.

581
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:30,030
<19-24,MATILDA>我昨晚跑出办公室
<19-24,MATILDA>I ran out of my office last night

582
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:33,490
<19-24,MATILDA>因为我约好和奥斯卡·德拉伦塔喝一杯  要迟到了
<19-24,MATILDA>because I was late for drinks with Oscar de la Renta.

583
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,620
<19-24,MATILDA>你尽可以去核实
<19-24,MATILDA>Feel free to check.

584
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:40,630
<19-24,MATILDA>至于艾拉对杂志的威胁
<19-24,MATILDA>Regarding Ella's threat to the magazine,

585
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:42,560
<19-24,MATILDA>我从没听过她这么说
<19-24,MATILDA>I never heard her say that.

586
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,520
<19-25,BECKETT>那你也不知道她掌握了什么情报吗
<19-25,BECKETT>And you have no idea what Ella was taking to the competition?

587
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,390
<19-26,MATILDA>不清楚
<19-26,MATILDA>None.

588
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:50,330
<19-26,MATILDA>但如果你查出来了  我还是有兴趣知道的
<19-26,MATILDA>But if you find out, I'd be curious to know.

589
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,130
<19-26,MATILDA>还有什么事吗  探长
<19-26,MATILDA>Anything else, detective?

590
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:57,600
<19-27,BECKETT>我需要那些录音
<19-27,BECKETT>I'm gonna need those recordings.

591
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:06,020
<20-1,RYAN>贝克特  玛蒂尔达的不在场证明确认了
<20-1,RYAN>Hey, Beckett. Matilda's alibi checks out.

592
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:09,100
<20-1,RYAN>她凌晨两点前都在和奥斯卡喝酒
<20-1,RYAN>She was having drinks with Oscar until about 2:00 a.m.

593
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,790
<20-2,BECKETT>所以玛蒂尔达不是凶手
<20-2,BECKETT>So Matilda's not our killer?

594
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:13,450
<20-2,BECKETT>而我们还不知道艾拉带到竞争对手去的
<20-2,BECKETT>And we still don't know what explosive information

595
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:15,650
<20-2,BECKETT>爆炸性的情报是什么
<20-2,BECKETT>Ella was taking to the competition.

596
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,880
<20-3,ESPOSITO>我在这些音频里的发现
<20-3,ESPOSITO>I think I may have found something on these audio files

597
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:19,470
<20-3,ESPOSITO>可以帮你们把这件事弄清楚
<20-3,ESPOSITO>that might shed light on that.

598
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,610
<20-3,ESPOSITO>我一直在听近一星期
<20-3,ESPOSITO>So I have been going though about a week of

599
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:24,290
<20-3,ESPOSITO>艾拉和她室友间的无聊对话
<20-3,ESPOSITO>inane conversations between Ella and her roommate.

600
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:26,300
<20-3,ESPOSITO>她在被杀当晚打了一通电话
<20-3,ESPOSITO>But she did place a call on the day of the murder

601
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,150
<20-3,ESPOSITO>非常奇怪
<20-3,ESPOSITO>that was pretty strange.

602
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:28,400
<20-3,ESPOSITO>听听看
<20-3,ESPOSITO>Check it out.

603
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,870
<20-4,ELLA>嗨  我是艾拉
<20-4,ELLA>Hey. It's me -- Ella.

604
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,680
<20-4,ELLA>《当代时尚》内部发生了奇怪的事
<20-4,ELLA>Something weird is going on inside Modern Fashion.

605
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,470
<20-4,ELLA>我觉得有人在针对我
<20-4,ELLA>I think someone's targeting me.

606
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:39,420
<20-4,ELLA>我需要你的帮助  赶快回电
<20-4,ELLA>I need your help. Call me back.

607
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,150
<20-5,RYAN>我们知道她这是打给谁吗
<20-5,RYAN>Do we know who's on the other end of that call?

608
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:42,540
<20-6,ESPOSITO>根据这些座机的通话记录
<20-6,ESPOSITO>Based on the landline phone records,

609
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:44,640
<20-6,ESPOSITO>这通电话是打给《当代时尚》的一个人
<20-6,ESPOSITO>the call was placed to someone at Modern Fashion,

610
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,800
<20-6,ESPOSITO>但因为线路经由电话总机
<20-6,ESPOSITO>But it was routed through a switchboard,

611
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,980
<20-6,ESPOSITO>所以无法显示她是打给谁的
<20-6,ESPOSITO>so it doesn't show who she was connected to.

612
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:50,470
<20-7,BECKETT>这范围可大到在那工作的100多个人
<20-7,BECKETT>This directory lists over 100 people that work there.

613
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:51,360
<20-7,BECKETT>可不是
<20-7,BECKETT>Yeah.

614
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,490
<20-8,ESPOSITO>幸运的是我有顺风耳
<20-8,ESPOSITO>Lucky I have crazy-good hearing.

615
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,000
<20-10,ESPOSITO>再听听开头
<20-10,ESPOSITO>Listen to the beginning again.

616
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:58,430
<20-10,ESPOSITO>我让个技术员分析了这些哔声
<20-10,ESPOSITO>I had a tech analyze those beeps

617
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:00,560
<20-10,ESPOSITO>然后将它们联系到相应的数字
<20-10,ESPOSITO>And connect them to the corresponding digits.

618
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:03,100
<20-10,ESPOSITO>这通电话是打给这个电话分机
<20-10,ESPOSITO>The call was placed to this extension.

619
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,700
<20-11,BECKETT>阿曼多·蒙托亚
<20-11,BECKETT>Armando Montoya.

620
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,410
<20-11,BECKETT>-他是《当代时尚》里的网络技术员  -是的
<20-11,BECKETT>- He's an I.T. tech at modern fashion? - Mm-hmm.

621
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:09,850
<20-11,BECKETT>艾拉为什么要向他求助
<20-11,BECKETT>What was Ella doing calling him for help?

622
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,960
<21-1,ARMANDO MONTOYA>我们是朋友
<21-1,ARMANDO MONTOYA>We were friends, you know?

623
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:20,270
<21-1,ARMANDO MONTOYA>这里的人都当我是空气  但艾拉没有
<21-1,ARMANDO MONTOYA>To most of the people here, I'm invisible, but Ella saw me.

624
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,860
<21-1,ARMANDO MONTOYA>她人很好
<21-1,ARMANDO MONTOYA>She was nice.

625
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:25,500
<21-2,BECKETT>她死的那天为什么需要你的帮助
<21-2,BECKETT>Why did she need your help the day she died?

626
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:28,000
<21-3,MONTOYA>她想让我看看玛蒂尔达的日程表
<21-3,MONTOYA>She wanted me to look at Matilda's calendar.

627
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,170
<21-4,BECKETT>为什么
<21-4,BECKETT>What for?

628
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:32,330
<21-5,MONTOYA>因为玛蒂尔达错过了一些重要的会议
<21-5,MONTOYA>Because Matilda missed some important meetings,

629
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:33,480
<21-5,MONTOYA>但是艾拉非常确定她把会议
<21-5,MONTOYA>But Ella was sure she entered them

630
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,350
<21-5,MONTOYA>都输入到日程表里去了
<21-5,MONTOYA>into the calendar correctly.

631
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,880
<21-5,MONTOYA>她想知道日程表是否被篡改了
<21-5,MONTOYA>She wanted to know if the calendar had been tampered with.

632
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,150
<21-6,BECKETT>那到底是不是呢
<21-6,BECKETT>And -- and was it?

633
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:42,840
<21-7,MONTOYA>过去几周  有几处日程被篡改了
<21-7,MONTOYA>Yes, everal entries had been changed over the past couple weeks --

634
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:44,430
<21-7,MONTOYA>都是在半夜发生的
<21-7,MONTOYA>All in the middle of the night.

635
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,950
<21-7,MONTOYA>当我给她看的时候
<21-7,MONTOYA>When I showed it to her,

636
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:48,250
<21-7,MONTOYA>她确信有人想陷害她
<21-7,MONTOYA>She was convinced that someone was trying to set her up.

637
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,670
<21-8,BECKETT>你知道是谁改的吗
<21-8,BECKETT>Well, were you able to tell who made those changes?

638
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:54,250
<21-9,MONTOYA>不知道  我只发现IP地址不在杂志内部
<21-9,MONTOYA>No, I tracked them all to an I.P. address outside Modern Fashion.

639
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,640
<21-9,MONTOYA>我只能做到这一步
<21-9,MONTOYA>It's the best I could do.

640
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:57,140
<21-9,MONTOYA>我告诉她后
<21-9,MONTOYA>I give her the info

641
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:59,850
<21-9,MONTOYA>她说她要找出陷害她的人
<21-9,MONTOYA>and she said she was gonna figure out who set her up...

642
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:01,650
<21-9,MONTOYA>让他们付出代价
<21-9,MONTOYA>and make them pay.

643
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,060
<21-9,MONTOYA>再听到她的消息时  她已经死了
<21-9,MONTOYA>Next I hear, she's dead.

644
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:09,360
<21-10,BECKETT>你还有那个IP地址吗
<21-10,BECKETT>Do you still have that I.P. Address?

645
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:11,600
<22-1,ESPOSITO>知道了  我会让技术员查查的
<22-1,ESPOSITO>Yeah. Okay. I'll have a tech run it down.

646
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,750
<22-1,ESPOSITO>但为什么会有人想陷害一个时尚助理呢
<22-1,ESPOSITO>But why would anyone want to sabotage a fashion assistant?

647
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:14,770
<22-2,BECKETT>我不知道  埃斯波
<22-2,BECKETT>I don't know, Espo.

648
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:18,450
<22-2,BECKETT>如果艾拉在追查幕后主使  也许她找到了
<22-2,BECKETT>If Ella went after whoever's behind this, maybe she found one.

649
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:20,200
<22-3,ESPOSITO>如果我查到地址  给你打电话
<22-3,ESPOSITO>All right, well, I'll give you a call when I get a location.

650
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,420
<22-4,BECKETT>好的  谢谢
<22-4,BECKETT>Okay. Thanks.

651
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,230
<22-4,BECKETT>还有问题吗  警探
<22-4,BECKETT>More questions, detective?

652
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:34,410
<23-1,MATILDA>事实上  我们有证据表明
<23-1,MATILDA>Actually, we found evidence that suggests

653
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:37,730
<23-2,BECKETT>不是艾拉搞砸了你的会议
<23-2,BECKETT>Ella wasn't responsible for screwing up your appointments.

654
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,600
<23-2,BECKETT>有人篡改了你的日程表
<23-2,BECKETT>Someone else changed your calendar --

655
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,380
<23-2,BECKETT>办公室之外的人干的
<23-2,BECKETT>Someone outside of this office.

656
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,510
<23-3,MATILDA>你是说我无缘无故把艾拉炒了
<23-3,MATILDA>Are you saying that I fired Ella for no reason?

657
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,940
<23-4,BECKETT>你知道为什么有人会这样对她吗
<23-4,BECKETT>Do you know why someone would have done this to her?

658
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:49,000
<23-4,BECKETT>不知道
<23-4,BECKETT>No.

659
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:53,060
<23-5,MATILDA>但我知道为什么有人会这样对我
<23-5,MATILDA>But I do know why someone would want to do this to me.

660
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,300
<23-6,BECKETT>什么意思
<23-6,BECKETT>What do you mean?

661
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,270
<23-7,MATILDA>自从格伦·卡特买下《当代时尚》
<23-7,MATILDA>Ever since Glen Carter bought modern fashion,

662
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:59,460
<23-7,MATILDA>那些鲨鱼就游过来了  他们闻到了血腥味
<23-7,MATILDA>The sharks have been circling. They smell blood.

663
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:03,000
<23-8,BECKETT>所以日程错误会在这个重要时期影响你的形象
<23-8,BECKETT>So the calendar mistakes made you look bad at a critical time?

664
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,280
<23-8,BECKETT>等我一下
<23-8,BECKETT>Excuse me.

665
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:09,620
<23-9,MATILDA>这正是我需要的  太"好"了
<23-9,MATILDA>Oh, this is just what I need.

666
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:10,870
<23-10,BECKETT>发生什么事了
<23-10,BECKETT>What's wrong?

667
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:13,740
<23-11,MATILDA>我要在半个小时内定夺一条要在这期上杂志的裙子
<23-11,MATILDA>I have to make a decision in the next half-hour about a dress,

668
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:16,160
<23-11,MATILDA>可模特还没出现
<23-11,MATILDA>this issue, and the model didn't show up.

669
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,420
<23-12,MATILDA>贝克特警探
<23-12,MATILDA>Detective Beckett.

670
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:25,920
<23-13,MATILDA>几年前我给你一份工作时  你拒绝了我
<23-13,MATILDA>You said "No" to me years ago when I offered you a job.

671
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,090
<23-13,MATILDA>现在还我一个人情吧
<23-13,MATILDA>Might you do a little favor for me now?

672
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:37,290
<24-1,MARTHA>理查德  看看这些漂亮的古董吊灯
<24-1,MARTHA>Oh, Richard, look at these beautiful antique chandeliers.

673
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:39,990
<24-2,LESLIE>如果你们感兴趣的话
<24-2,LESLIE>So, if you're interested,

674
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:43,650
<24-2,LESLIE>明年秋天还有两个时段可以预定

713
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,880
<25-9,BECKETT>也许那个没来的模特穿起来更好看
<25-9,BECKETT>looked better on the model that didn't show up.

725
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:04,080

00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:08,390
<25-16,CASTLE>他们的不幸成就了我们一生的喜悦

<25-16,CASTLE>我们可以拿下他们今春的空档
<25-16,CASTLE>We can take their spot for the spring.

737
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,120
<26-2,BECKETT>还要仔细筹备安排
<26-2,BECKETT>and the planning that we have to do, and I just --

00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,920
<26-2,BECKETT>我不想太着急做这些
<26-2,BECKETT>I don't want to rush any of this.

<26-6,ESPOSITO>So, a tech was able to track down that I.P. address.

745
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:05,600
<26-6,ESPOSITO>更改日程表的人
<26-6,ESPOSITO>Whoever changed that calendar

746
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,450
<26-6,ESPOSITO>是索霍区的一个设计工作室的
<26-6,ESPOSITO>did it from a design studio in SoHo.

00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:09,880
<26-7,BECKETT>《当代时尚》和这个工作室有什么关联吗
<26-7,BECKETT>Is there any connection between the studio and Modern Fashion?

748
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,080
<26-8,ESPOSITO>事实上  他们有关系
<26-8,ESPOSITO>As a matter of fact, there is.

<27-11,YUMI>她想我给她一份工作
<27-11,YUMI>She, uh, she came to ask me for a job.

786
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,390
<27-12,CASTLE>真的
<27-12,CASTLE>Really?

787
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,950
<27-13,YUMI>我告诉她我很想帮她
<27-13,YUMI>I told her I wanted to help,

788
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:28,370
<27-13,YUMI>但这件事我无能为力
<27-13,YUMI>but there was absolutely nothing I could do.

789
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:32,740
<27-13,YUMI>被玛蒂尔达·金炒了鱿鱼的人  没人敢雇他们
<27-13,YUMI>When Matilda King fires someone, they are radioactive.

790
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:34,470
<27-14,CASTLE>你知道她为什么被解雇吗
<27-14,CASTLE>Do you have any idea why she was fired?

791
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:35,720
<27-15,YUMI>不知道
<27-15,YUMI>No.

792
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:37,520
<27-16,BECKETT>我觉得你知道
<27-16,BECKETT>I think you do.

793
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:40,160
<27-16,BECKETT>有人篡改了玛蒂尔达·金的日程表
<27-16,BECKETT>Someone changed Matilda King's calendar.

794
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:42,080
<27-16,BECKETT>玛蒂尔达以为是艾拉  但其实不是她
<27-16,BECKETT>Matilda thought it was Ella, but it wasn't Ella.

795
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,440
<27-16,BECKETT>是你工作室的人干的
<27-16,BECKETT>It was someone from your studio.

796
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:47,090
<27-17,CASTLE>我们追踪到了IP地址  艾拉也追踪到了
<27-17,CASTLE>We traced the I.P. address, so did Ella.

797
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:49,110
<27-17,CASTLE>所以她昨晚才会来到这里
<27-17,CASTLE>That's what she was doing here last night.

798
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:51,590
<27-17,CASTLE>她不是来向你要份工作
<27-17,CASTLE>She wasn't asking for a job.

799
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:54,600
<27-17,CASTLE>她是来找出是谁篡改了日程表
<27-17,CASTLE>She was looking to find who made those changes --

800
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,410
<27-17,CASTLE>是谁毁了她的事业
<27-17,CASTLE>Who ruined her career.

801
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:57,810
<27-18,BECKETT>鉴于你刚刚对我们撒谎了
<27-18,BECKETT>And given the fact that you just lied to us,

802
00:32:57,810 --> 00:32:59,850
<27-18,BECKETT>我猜就是你干的
<27-18,BECKETT>I am guessing it was you.

803
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:00,710
<27-18,BECKETT>我
<27-18,BECKETT>Me?

804
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:04,100
<27-19,YUMI>你们知道玛蒂尔达·金在时装产业
<27-19,YUMI>Do you have any idea how powerful Matilda King is

805
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,640
<27-19,YUMI>有多强大的影响力吗
<27-19,YUMI>in the fashion industry?

806
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:08,970
<27-19,YUMI>我的设计是"美妙五人"的得奖作品
<27-19,YUMI>My design is a "Fab Five" winner.

807
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:11,180
<27-19,YUMI>玛蒂尔达就要让我名声鹊起
<27-19,YUMI>Matilda's about to make me famous.

808
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:14,080
<27-19,YUMI>惹了她等于自断前程
<27-19,YUMI>Messing with her would be career suicide.

809
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,510
<27-19,YUMI>我怎么可能有杀人动机呢
<27-19,YUMI>What could possibly be my motive?

810
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:17,930
<27-20,CASTLE>很简单
<27-20,CASTLE>Oh, it's simple.

811
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:20,130
<27-20,CASTLE>你要让她被解雇
<27-20,CASTLE>You needed to get her fired.

812
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:21,890
<27-20,CASTLE>你要诋毁她的名声
<27-20,CASTLE>You needed to discredit her.

813
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:24,760
<27-21,YUMI>我究竟为什么要这么做
<27-21,YUMI>Why on earth would I do that?

814
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:28,070
<27-22,CASTLE>因为你在"美妙五人"的得奖设计
<27-22,CASTLE>Because your winning "Fab Five" design...

815
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:30,720
<27-22,CASTLE>不是出自你之手
<27-22,CASTLE>isn't yours.

816
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:34,190
<27-22,CASTLE>这是艾拉的素描本
<27-22,CASTLE>From Ella's sketchbook.

817
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:36,070
<28-1,CASTLE>与图片上的一模一样
<28-1,CASTLE>They're exactly the same.

818
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,260
<28-2,YUMI>艾拉是个有理想抱负的设计师
<28-2,YUMI>Ella was an aspiring designer.

819
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:40,000
<28-2,YUMI>她肯定是模仿我的设计
<28-2,YUMI>She must have copied me.

820
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:43,400
<28-3,BECKETT>不  艾拉的舍友一个月前已经看到在她绘图了
<28-3,BECKETT>No. Ella's roommate saw her making those sketches months ago.

821
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:44,570
<28-4,YUMI>这么说
<28-4,YUMI>Okay, then.

822
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:46,330
<28-4,YUMI>如果这是出自她的素描本
<28-4,YUMI>If you found it in her sketchbook,

823
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:47,430
<28-4,YUMI>那怎么会在我手上呢
<28-4,YUMI>then how did I get it?

824
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:49,130
<28-4,YUMI>玛蒂尔达的另一个助理格蕾丝
<28-4,YUMI>Well, Matilda's other assistant, Grace,

825
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:53,000
<28-5,BECKETT>已经确认了她看见艾拉给你她的复印本
<28-5,BECKETT>confirmed seeing Ella give you copies of her sketches.

826
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:53,990
<28-5,BECKETT>很显然  当你去"美妙五人"的展示会议上
<28-5,BECKETT>Apparently, you had them on you

827
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,640
<28-5,BECKETT>你就将它据为己有了
<28-5,BECKETT>when you went in on your "Fab five" pitch meeting.

828
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,070
<28-6,CASTLE>从那开始  你就自编自导自演了
<28-6,CASTLE>And from there, the story writes itself.

829
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,530
<28-7,BECKETT>你展示了自己的设计作品
<28-7,BECKETT>You showed your designs,

830
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:02,760
<28-6,CASTLE>然而你的作品不够好
<28-6,CASTLE>and they just weren't good enough to make the cut,

831
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:05,470
<28-6,CASTLE>但是艺术总监在你的包里看到了这些
<28-6,CASTLE>but then the artistic director sees these in your bag --

832
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:08,310
<28-6,CASTLE>这设计新奇  惊艳  蕴玉之石
<28-6,CASTLE>The fresh, stunning, raw talent --

833
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:09,850
<28-6,CASTLE>"美妙五人"的不二之选
<28-6,CASTLE>Perfect for the "Fab Five."

834
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:11,750
<28-7,BECKETT>只是这不是你的作品
<28-7,BECKETT>Except they weren't your designs.

835
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:14,690
<28-8,CASTLE>这事只有两个人知道  你和艾拉
<28-8,CASTLE>Only two people knew that -- you and Ella.

836
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,530
<28-8,CASTLE>成为"美妙五人"设计师
<28-8,CASTLE>And being a "Fab Five" designer

837
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:19,090
<28-8,CASTLE>可以成就你的事业  所以你做出了决定
<28-8,CASTLE>could literally make your career, so you made a choise.

838
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:21,060
<28-9,BECKETT>一旦你被选为"美妙五人"之后
<28-9,BECKETT>Once you were chosen for the "Fab Five,"

839
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:24,490
<28-9,BECKETT>你意识到艾拉会知道你偷了她的设计
<28-9,BECKETT>you realized that Ella would know you had stolen her designs.

840
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:27,600
<28-9,BECKETT>你得去破坏她的名声让全世界都不相信她
<28-9,BECKETT>You had to discredit her so that no one would believe her.

841
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:32,130
<28-10,YUMI>我要请律师
<28-10,YUMI>I want a lawyer.

842
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:38,280
<29-1,CASTLE>艾拉肯定在工作室和优美当面对质过
<29-1,CASTLE>Ella must have confronted Yumi at his studio.

843
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,580
<29-1,CASTLE>如果她威胁要曝光丑闻
<29-1,CASTLE>If she threatened to expose the whole scandal,

844
00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:41,620
<29-1,CASTLE>他的职业生涯就完蛋了
<29-1,CASTLE>his career would be over.

845
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:42,690
<29-1,CASTLE>他必须杀了她掩盖事实
<29-1,CASTLE>He had to kill her to hide the truth.

846
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:43,490
<29-2,BECKETT>没错  这就都说得通了
<29-2,BECKETT>Yeah. That all makes sense.

847
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:45,990
<29-2,BECKETT>现在我们只要把他和案发现场联系起来就行
<29-2,BECKETT>Now we just have to connect him to the crime scene.

848
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:47,940
<29-3,RYAN>可现在的问题是  联系不起来
<29-3,RYAN>Only one problem -- you can't.

849
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:49,360
<29-3,RYAN>优美没杀害艾拉
<29-3,RYAN>Yumi didn't kill Ella.

850
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,440
<29-4,CASTLE>你怎么知道
<29-4,CASTLE>How do you know?

851
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,650
<29-5,RYAN>多个员工见到艾拉和优美对质
<29-5,RYAN>Multiple employees saw Ella confront Yumi,

852
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:54,120
<29-5,RYAN>但她走了之后
<29-5,RYAN>but after she took off,

853
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,350
<29-5,RYAN>他一直待在工作室直到凌晨三点  没离开过
<29-5,RYAN>he was at the studio till 3:00 a.m. He never left.

854
00:34:56,350 --> 00:34:57,760
<29-6,BECKETT>等等  你确定吗
<29-6,BECKETT>Wait. Are you -- are you sure?

855
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,990
<29-7,RYAN>他的不在场证明确认了
<29-7,RYAN>His alibi rocks out.

856
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:01,110
<29-8,CASTLE>但我们知道工作室里
<29-8,CASTLE>but we know someone changed matilda's calendar

857
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:01,840
<29-8,CASTLE>有人篡改了玛蒂尔达的日程表
<29-8,CASTLE>from that studio.

858
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,570
<29-8,CASTLE>他肯定以某种方式牵涉其中
<29-8,CASTLE>He has to be involved somehow.

859
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:05,790
<29-9,RYAN>我觉得其他人也牵涉到了
<29-9,RYAN>I think someone else was, too.

860
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:07,620
<29-9,RYAN>我查过了优美的通话记录
<29-9,RYAN>I went through Yumi's phone records,

861
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:08,890
<29-9,RYAN>艾拉离开之后
<29-9,RYAN>and after Ella left,

862
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:12,650
<29-9,RYAN>他打了六个电话到《当代时尚》去
<29-9,RYAN>he made half a dozen phone calls to Modern Fashion.

863
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,170
<30-1,MATILDA>如此漂亮的设计
<30-1,MATILDA>Such beautiful designs.

864
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:23,640
<30-1,MATILDA>这么长时间  我竟然不知道
<30-1,MATILDA>After all this time, I had no idea.

865
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:26,610
<30-1,MATILDA>如果她知道这些设计被偷了
<30-1,MATILDA>If she knew these designs had been stolen,

866
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:27,970
<30-1,MATILDA>为什么不来找我
<30-1,MATILDA>why didn't she come to me.

867
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:29,870
<30-2,BECKETT>也许她觉得你根本不会听她的话
<30-2,BECKETT>Maybe she didn't think you would listen --

868
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:31,750
<30-2,BECKETT>至少不会听像她这样的人说话
<30-2,BECKETT>At least, not to someone like her.

869
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:34,120
<30-2,BECKETT>也许她只是想报复
<30-2,BECKETT>Maybe she just wanted revenge.

870
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,800
<30-3,MATILDA>那样的话她目的达到了
<30-3,MATILDA>She would've gotten it.

871
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:39,690
<30-3,MATILDA>如果我们的"美妙五人"名单被《时尚女装》曝光是舞弊的话
<30-3,MATILDA>If Couture Chic xposed that our"Fab five" list was corrupt,

872
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:41,230
<30-3,MATILDA>我就会丢了饭碗
<30-3,MATILDA>it would have cost me my job.

873
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:42,880
<30-4,CASTLE>还会给谁带来损失
<30-4,CASTLE>Who else stood to lose?

874
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,380
<30-5,MATILDA>所有牵涉其中的人
<30-5,MATILDA>Everyone involved, I suppose.

875
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:47,600
<30-6,BECKETT>艾拉离开优美的工作室之后
<30-6,BECKETT>Well, just after Ella left Yumi's studio,

876
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,010
<30-6,BECKETT>他打了一连串的电话
<30-6,BECKETT>he made a series of phone calls

877
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:51,400
<30-6,BECKETT>给《当代时尚》的某个人
<30-6,BECKETT>to someone here at modern fashion.

878
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,940
<30-7,CASTLE>这个人知道优美的秘密
<30-7,CASTLE>Someone who must have known Yumi's secret --

879
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,350
<30-7,CASTLE>帮他掩盖事实真相
<30-7,CASTLE>who was helping him cover it up.

880
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:57,260
<30-7,CASTLE>这个人知道如果真相大白了
<30-7,CASTLE>Someone who knew that if the truth got out,

881
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:58,810
<30-7,CASTLE>就会同时毁了他们两个
<30-7,CASTLE>it could destroy them both.

882
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,520
<30-8,MATILDA>只有一个人会这么做
<30-8,MATILDA>There's only one person it could be.

883
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,220
<30-9,BECKETT>谁
<30-9,BECKETT>Who?

884
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:10,630
<31-1,MATILDA>这期杂志一周内就要印刷了
<31-1,MATILDA>We go to print in one week on this issue,

885
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:13,910
<31-1,MATILDA>可是你们给我的封面备选还是不尽人意
<31-1,MATILDA>and I'm still not happy with the cover options.

886
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:16,650
<31-1,MATILDA>而且我们"美妙五人"栏目也还没完成
<31-1,MATILDA>And we're still not there with the "Fab Five" spread!

887
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:19,390
<31-1,MATILDA>散会吧  继续干活去
<31-1,MATILDA>Now, go, please, make it better!

888
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:23,290
<31-1,MATILDA>朱利安  聊一下
<31-1,MATILDA>Julian, a word.

889
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,290
<31-2,MATILDA>当你见到优美交上来的设计时
<31-2,MATILDA>What was your first reaction

890
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:30,860
<31-2,MATILDA>你的第一反应是什么
<31-2,MATILDA>when you saw Yumi's design submission?

891
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:31,820
<31-3,JULIAN>我惊呆了
<31-3,JULIAN>Blown away.

892
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:33,600
<31-3,JULIAN>所以我才提名他
<31-3,JULIAN>I mean, that's why I nominated him.

893
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:37,810
<31-4,MATILDA>那你能不能告诉我  当他向你坦白
<31-4,MATILDA>Now, is there a reason why you didn't come to me

894
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:40,080
<31-4,MATILDA>他偷了艾拉的设计时
<31-4,MATILDA>and tell me when he confessed to you

895
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,450
<31-4,MATILDA>你为什么没来告诉我呢
<31-4,MATILDA>that he stole Ella's design?

896
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,420
<31-5,JULIAN>什么意思
<31-5,JULIAN>What do you mean?

897
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:45,430
<31-6,MATILDA>我今早跟优美谈过
<31-6,MATILDA>I had a word with Yumi this morning.

898
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:47,640
<31-6,MATILDA>他说这件事你早就知情了
<31-6,MATILDA>He told me you've known for a while.

899
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:51,820
<31-6,MATILDA>而且他还说篡改我的日程表是你的主意
<31-6,MATILDA>And he also said it was your idea to change my calendar.

900
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:53,120
<31-7,JULIAN>他在撒谎
<31-7,JULIAN>He's lying.

901
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,140
<31-8,MATILDA>然后我又问过卡特先生
<31-8,MATILDA>Then I spoke to Mr. Carter,

902
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:59,000
<31-8,MATILDA>他证实了我的猜测
<31-8,MATILDA>and he confirmed my suspicion.

903
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:01,670
<31-8,MATILDA>你对我的职位虎视眈眈
<31-8,MATILDA>You've been gunning for my job.

904
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:07,280
<31-10,MATILDA>-这又能证明什么  -证明你想一石二鸟
<31-10,MATILDA>- What does that prove? - It proves that you tried to kill two birds with one stone.

905
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:12,060
<31-10,MATILDA>你篡改我的日程表  败坏艾拉的名声也伤到了我
<31-10,MATILDA>You changed my calendar in order to discredit Ella and undermine me.

906
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:14,920
<31-11,JULIAN>-你不知道自己在说什么  -少来这套
<31-11,JULIAN>- You don't know what you're talking about. - Don't even.

907
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:17,510
<31-12,MATILDA>你被解雇了
<31-12,MATILDA>You're fired.

908
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:24,050
<31-13,JULIAN>我离开这  都用不着到今晚  就能在任何一间
<31-13,JULIAN>I can walk out of here and get hired at any magazine I want

909
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:25,530
<31-13,JULIAN>杂志社找到工作
<31-13,JULIAN>by the end of the day.

910
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:32,100
<31-14,BECKETT>你短期内都不用再找工作了  朱利安
<31-14,BECKETT>You won't be applying for a new job anytime soon, Julian.

911
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:32,990
<31-14,BECKETT>天啊
<31-14,BECKETT>Oh, my...

912
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:34,250
<31-15,JULIAN>这太荒唐了
<31-15,JULIAN>This is ridiculous.

913
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,090
<31-15,JULIAN>玛蒂尔达·金
<31-15,JULIAN>Matilda King --

914
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:41,080
<31-15,JULIAN>她最喜欢这样折磨人玩了
<31-15,JULIAN>she takes pleasure in torturing people like this.

915
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:46,040
<31-15,JULIAN>实际上  她给你们讲的故事就跟她本人一样疯狂
<31-15,JULIAN>Fact is, her story is as crazy as she is.

916
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,050
<31-16,BECKETT>只不过我们搜了你家附近的垃圾桶
<31-16,BECKETT>Except we searched the dumpsters around your apartment,

917
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:50,820
<31-16,BECKETT>找到了艾拉的围巾
<31-16,BECKETT>and we found Ella's scarf --

918
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,680
<31-16,BECKETT>也正是那条你用来勒死她的围巾
<31-16,BECKETT>the one that you used to strangle her.

919
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:57,030
<31-16,BECKETT>实验室在那条围巾上找到了两组DNA
<31-16,BECKETT>The lab also found two sets of DNA on that scarf --

920
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:59,340
<31-16,BECKETT>艾拉的和你的
<31-16,BECKETT>Ella's and yours.

921
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:04,410
<31-17,JULIAN>在我的律师到之前  我都不会再说一句话
<31-17,JULIAN>I'm not gonna say another word until my lawyer's present.

922
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,670
<32-1,RYAN>检察官怎么说
<32-1,RYAN>So, what did the D.A. say?

923
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:14,740
<32-2,BECKETT>朱利安不肯认罪  他要在庭审上碰碰运气
<32-2,BECKETT>That Julian's gonna plead not guilty, take his chances at trial.

924
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:17,850
<32-3,CASTLE>好消息是优美决定和检方合作换取免罪
<32-3,CASTLE>The good news is Yumi cut a deal to avoid charges.

925
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:20,890
<32-3,CASTLE>看来谋杀不是他的菜
<32-3,CASTLE>I guess murder is not his type of accessory.

926
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:23,370
<32-4,BECKETT>他向检察官交代  他告诉过朱利安
<32-4,BECKETT>Yeah. He confessed to telling Julian

927
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:27,340
<32-4,BECKETT>艾拉已经发现了真相  朱利安说他会摆平她
<32-4,BECKETT>that Ella figured it all out and Julian told him that he would take care of her.

928
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:30,010
<32-5,CASTLE>看来今年"美妙五人"变成"美妙四人"了
<32-5,CASTLE>So, I guess the "Fab Five" is gonna be "Fab Four" this year.

929
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,180
<32-6,RYAN>我一直以为时尚产业很光彩迷人呢
<32-6,RYAN>I always thought the fashion industry seemed glamorous.

930
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,920
<32-6,RYAN>没想到就连黑帮都比他们有道德
<32-6,RYAN>Turns out, mobsters are more ethical.

931
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,400
<32-7,BECKETT>天啊  不然你认为我为什么要退出那行呀
<32-7,BECKETT>Oh, my gosh. Why do you think I quit?

932
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,230
<32-7,BECKETT>我宁可跟杀人犯混在一块也不要天天对着一堆模特
<32-7,BECKETT>I'll take murderers over models any day.

933
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,970
<32-8,ESPOSITO>要是杀人犯都这么性感就好了
<32-8,ESPOSITO>If only murderers were this hot.

934
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:42,580
<32-9,BECKETT>我还有些文书工作没做完
<32-9,BECKETT>I got a bit of paperwork to do.

935
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:44,670
<32-10,CASTLE>无聊的文书工作
<32-10,CASTLE>Ah! Boring paperwork.

936
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:46,360
<32-10,CASTLE>我听到这句话就想回家了
<32-10,CASTLE>That is my cue to leave.

937
00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:48,870
<32-11,BECKETT>-晚点见  -好的  我做完就去找你
<32-11,BECKETT>- I'll see you later? - Yeah. Yeah, I'll see you when I'm done.

939
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:18,160
<33-1,CASTLE>要来杯酒吗
<33-1,CASTLE>Hey. Shall I pour you a glass?

940
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:20,960
<33-2,BECKETT>不  现在不喝
<33-2,BECKETT>Uh, no. Not right now.

941
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:23,130
<33-3,CASTLE>一切都还好吗
<33-3,CASTLE>Everything all right?

942
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:27,560
<33-4,BECKETT>宝贝  咱俩得聊聊
<33-4,BECKETT>Babe, we have to talk.

943
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:33,510
<33-5,CASTLE>通常人们在宣布坏消息之前才用这个开场白
<33-5,CASTLE>Wow. That's something people say before they deliver bad news.

944
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:42,290
<33-5,CASTLE>你还记得你昨晚打电话问我场地的事吗
<33-5,CASTLE>You know when you called last night about the venue?

945
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:46,830
<33-6,BECKETT>我当时跟玛蒂尔达在一起  她希望我试一条裙子
<33-6,BECKETT>I was with Matilda, and she wanted me to model a dress.

946
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:51,430
<33-6,BECKETT>那条裙子是件婚纱
<33-6,BECKETT>And it was a wedding dress.

947
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:55,640
<33-6,BECKETT>当我看到自己穿着婚纱的样子  我就
<33-6,BECKETT>And when I saw myself in it, I just --

948
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,930
<33-6,BECKETT>我想起了我母亲
<33-6,BECKETT>I started to think about my mom.

949
00:40:57,930 --> 00:41:00,110
<33-6,BECKETT>她一定希望自己能参与这一切
<33-6,BECKETT>She would have loved to have been a part of all of this,

950
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:03,870
<33-6,BECKETT>帮我选婚礼上用的花  陪我试婚纱
<33-6,BECKETT>to help pick out the flowers and try on the dresses and...

951
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,920
<33-6,BECKETT>当我在镜子里看到自己  我就
<33-6,BECKETT>When I looked at myself in the mirror, I just --

952
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:10,390
<33-6,BECKETT>我期待见到她站在我身后
<33-6,BECKETT>I-I halfway expected to see her right behind me...

953
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:15,150
<33-6,BECKETT>可她却不在  有那么一刻  我心里想
<33-6,BECKETT>And she wasn't there. And, just for a moment, I thought to myself,

954
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:18,240
<33-6,BECKETT>"我不知道没有她在  我能不能完成这一切"
<33-6,BECKETT>"I don't know if I can do all of this without her."

955
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:21,810
<33-6,BECKETT>所以当你问的时候  我才没答应
<33-6,BECKETT>And that's why I said no when you asked about the venue.

956
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:25,510
<33-6,BECKETT>很抱歉  是我在犯傻
<33-6,BECKETT>I'm so sorry. It was so stupid.

957
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,960
<33-7,CASTLE>不
<33-7,CASTLE>No.

958
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:29,300
<33-7,CASTLE>不  一点都不傻
<33-7,CASTLE>No, not stupid.

959
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:31,210
<33-7,CASTLE>这是人性
<33-7,CASTLE>Human.

960
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:37,550
<33-8,BECKETT>你知道我还希望她能见证什么吗
<33-8,BECKETT>Do you know what else I wish she could experience?

961
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,430
<33-9,CASTLE>你
<33-9,CASTLE>You.

962
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:41,160
<33-9,CASTLE>真的吗
<33-9,CASTLE>Really?

963
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,650
<33-10,BECKETT>她肯定会超爱你
<33-10,BECKETT>She would have loved you.

964
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:49,490
<33-11,CASTLE>凯特
<33-11,CASTLE>You know, Kate...

965
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:52,180
<33-11,CASTLE>如果你还需要多点时间的话
<33-11,CASTLE>if you need more time --

966
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:55,010
<33-12,BECKETT>不不  我不需要更多时间考虑了
<33-12,BECKETT>No. No, I don't -- I don't need any more time.

967
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:57,200
<33-12,BECKETT>我甚至不想等到秋天
<33-12,BECKETT>I don't even want us to wait until the fall.

968
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:00,240
<33-12,BECKETT>我觉得我们可以找到另外一个能在春天结婚的地方
<33-12,BECKETT>I think we can find a new venue in the spring.

969
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:02,400
<33-13,CASTLE>你觉得咱们能做得到
<33-13,CASTLE>You think we can pull it off?

970
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:03,420
<33-13,CASTLE>当然
<33-13,CASTLE>Yeah.

971
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:06,410
<33-14,BECKETT>我婚纱都准备好了
<33-14,BECKETT>I mean, I already have the dress.
