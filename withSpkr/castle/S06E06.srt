1
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:17,060
<1-1,RICHARD CASTLE>这完全是惊悚片里的场景
<1-1,RICHARD CASTLE>This is straight out of a slasher flick.

2
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,670
<1-1,RICHARD CASTLE>通常会发现死者躺在这样的走廊尽头
<1-1,RICHARD CASTLE>Usually find murder victims at the end of hallways like these.

3
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:22,320
<1-1,RICHARD CASTLE>难以置信阿丽克西斯住在这里
<1-1,RICHARD CASTLE>Cannot believe Alexis lives here.

4
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:25,300
<1-2,MARTHA RODGERS>理查德  阿丽克西斯和派邀请我们吃晚餐
<1-2,MARTHA RODGERS>Richard, Alexis and Pi have invited us for dinner.

5
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,980
<1-2,MARTHA RODGERS>这对他们而言是很大的一步
<1-2,MARTHA RODGERS>This is a big step for them.

6
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,110
<1-2,MARTHA RODGERS>不要挑三拣四的
<1-2,MARTHA RODGERS>So let us not be judgmental.

11
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:30,730
<1-3,CASTLE>好吧
<1-3,CASTLE>Fine.

12
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:32,110
<1-4,MARTHA>再说
<1-4,MARTHA>Besides...

13
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:34,760
<1-4,MARTHA>难道你忘了你大学时住的茅屋吗
<1-4,MARTHA>remember the hovel you lived in in college?

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,230
<1-5,CASTLE>唯一的区别是我没和派同居
<1-5,CASTLE>Only difference is I wasn't shacking up with Pi.

17
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:41,150
<1-6,MARTHA>你保持开明的态度真好  亲爱的
<1-6,MARTHA>Well, it's nice that you're keeping an open mind, dear.

19
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,630
<1-6,MARTHA>你们来了
<1-6,MARTHA>You're here!

21
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:47,000
<1-7,ALEXIS CASTLE>快进来吧  我好想向你们展示我们的温馨小屋
<1-7,ALEXIS CASTLE>Come on in. I'm so excited for you to see our place.

<1-7,ALEXIS CASTLE>进来吧
<1-7,ALEXIS CASTLE>Come on.

24
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,750
<1-8,MARTHA>天啊  你的第一个公寓
<1-8,MARTHA>Oh... my. Your first place.

25
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:59,310
<1-9,PI>你好  C先生
<1-9,PI>Hey! Mr. C.!

26
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:01,700
<1-10,PI>欢迎  准备好
<1-10,PI>Welcome. And prepare yourself

27
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,680
<1-10,PI>吃上一顿美味实惠的晚餐吧
<1-10,PI>for some savory and sustainable dining.

28
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,500
<1-11,CASTLE>让我猜猜  会有水果
<1-11,CASTLE>Ah, let me guess. There will be fruit.

29
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,520
<1-12,PI>我会把你变成果食主义者的  C先生
<1-12,PI>I'll make a fruitarian out of you yet, Mr. C.

30
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,110
<1-13,MARTHA>-太棒了  - 这是一份小小的乔迁礼物
<1-13,MARTHA>- Great. - Uh, here is a, um, little housewarming present.

31
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:15,330
<1-13,MARTHA>它需要阳光
<1-13,MARTHA>And it needs sunlight,

32
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:17,520
<1-13,MARTHA>而且还有一张小贺卡
<1-13,MARTHA>and there's a little gift card as well.

33
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:18,710
<1-14,ALEXIS>谢谢你  奶奶
<1-14,ALEXIS>Thank you, gram.

34
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,620
<1-14,ALEXIS>你觉得怎么样
<1-14,ALEXIS>Well? What do you think?

35
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:21,790
<1-15,MARTHA>我觉得很不错
<1-15,MARTHA>Oh, I think it's adorable.

36
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,170
<1-15,MARTHA>我喜欢你们做的装修
<1-15,MARTHA>I love what the two of you have done with this.

37
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:26,490
<1-16,PI>是啊  我们装修时很开心
<1-16,PI>Yeah, we've had lots of fun fixing it up.

38
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:28,450
<1-16,PI>我们坐在毯子上吃东西
<1-16,PI>We were eating on a blanket on the floor,

39
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:30,380
<1-16,PI>然后我们发现了这扇旧门  然后把它做成了桌子
<1-16,PI>but then we found this old door and set it up as a table.

40
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:33,060
<1-17,ALEXIS>我在餐馆附近的垃圾桶里发现了椅子
<1-17,ALEXIS>And I found the chairs next to a restaurant dumpster.

41
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,140
<1-18,MARTHA>垃圾桶里的椅子  那真是
<1-18,MARTHA>Oh! Dumpster chairs. That's...

42
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:36,960
<1-19,CASTLE>太棒了
<1-19,CASTLE>great.

43
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,840
<1-20,MARTHA>波西米亚式生活
<1-20,MARTHA>Well, there is nothing like

44
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:42,410
<1-20,MARTHA>最能促进血液循环了
<1-20,MARTHA>la vie boheme to get the blood flowing.

45
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:43,340
<1-20,MARTHA>给我吧
<1-20,MARTHA>I'll take that.

46
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:44,510
<1-21,MARTHA>友好点
<1-21,MARTHA>Be nice.

47
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:46,840
<1-21,MARTHA>瞧
<1-21,MARTHA>Oh, look.

48
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:47,930
<1-21,MARTHA>蒲团
<1-21,MARTHA>A futon.

49
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,840
<1-8,MARTHA>真爽
<1-8,MARTHA>Oh, yes.

50
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,070
<1-22,CASTLE>如果你们想要坚实的座位
<1-22,CASTLE>You know, if you guys want something real to sit on,

51
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:57,610
<1-22,CASTLE>我仓库里还有一个旧沙发  我可以...
<1-22,CASTLE>I have an old couch in storage. I could just--

52
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:00,270
<1-23,PI>我说不好  C先生
<1-23,PI>Hmm. Uh, I don't know, Mr. C. Um...

53
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,020
<1-23,PI>那是什么颜色的
<1-23,PI>What color is it?

54
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:03,870
<1-24,CASTLE>免费的
<1-24,CASTLE>Free.

55
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:06,710
<1-25,ALEXIS>爸爸  我们不用  需要的我们都有了
<1-25,ALEXIS>Dad, we're fine. We have everything we need.

56
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,380
<1-26,MARTHA>派  阿丽克西斯告诉我你找了份新工作
<1-26,MARTHA>So, Pi, Alexis tells me that you have a new job.

57
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:12,470
<1-27,PI>是的  我在为非政府组织
<1-27,PI>I do indeed. I am tracking bee populations in the city

58
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,470
<1-27,PI>追踪蜜蜂种群
<1-27,PI>for an N.G.O.

59
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,680
<1-29,PI>这和我在哥斯达黎加做的工作很像
<1-29,PI>It's a lot like the job I did in Costa Rica.

60
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,840
<1-29,PI>我们在评估蜂群的能力和数量
<1-29,PI>We're assessing the colony's strength and numbers.

61
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,170
<1-30,CASTLE>就是说你负责数蜜蜂
<1-30,CASTLE>So you're... counting bees.

62
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,380
<1-31,PI>不止如此  C先生
<1-31,PI>Well, there's a little more to it than that, Mr. C.,

63
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,540
<1-31,PI>但  是的
<1-31,PI>but... yeah.

64
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,200
<1-32,CASTLE>那是份真正的工作
<1-32,CASTLE>And that's a real job?

65
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,760
<1-32,CASTLE>对  是真正的工作
<1-32,CASTLE>Yes, it's a real job.

66
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,300
<1-33,ALEXIS>蜜蜂对食物供应来说很重要
<1-33,ALEXIS>Bees are vital to the food supply.

67
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,460
<1-33,ALEXIS>这是重要的工作
<1-33,ALEXIS>It's important work.

68
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,100
<1-33,ALEXIS>好吧
<1-33,ALEXIS>Well...

69
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:35,420
<1-34,CASTLE>只要这工作能让你们买得起水果摆桌上就好
<1-34,CASTLE>so long as it puts fruit on the table.

70
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,940
<1-35,MARTHA>说到桌子  我饿坏了
<1-35,MARTHA>Speaking of the table, I am famished.

71
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,180
<1-35,MARTHA>我们可以开餐了吗
<1-35,MARTHA>Shall we dine?

72
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,490
<1-36,PI>好  开饭吧
<1-36,PI>Yes, let's do that.

73
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:50,250
<2-1,CASTLE>不用说  晚餐是一场灾难
<2-1,CASTLE>Needless to say, dinner was a disaster,

74
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,650
<2-1,CASTLE>但真正的灾难是
<2-1,CASTLE>but the real disaster is that

75
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:53,700
<2-1,CASTLE>阿丽克西斯和他同居了
<2-1,CASTLE>Alexis has moved in with this guy.

76
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,910
<2-1,CASTLE>他根本配不上她
<2-1,CASTLE>He's just so wrong for her.

77
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,090
<2-2,KATE BECKETT>她会想明白的
<2-2,KATE BECKETT>Yeah, well, she'll figure it out.

78
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:57,990
<2-2,KATE BECKETT>至少她没住在脏地方  那很好
<2-2,KATE BECKETT>At least she's not living in squalor. That's good.

79
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:00,430
<2-3,CASTLE>不  可不好  我倒希望是脏地方
<2-3,CASTLE>No, it's not good. I was hoping for squalor.

80
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,430
<2-3,CASTLE>我指望是脏地方
<2-3,CASTLE>I was counting on squalor.

81
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,520
<2-3,CASTLE>因为阿丽克西斯受不了脏地方
<2-3,CASTLE>Because Alexis cannot last in squalor.

82
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:06,900
<2-3,CASTLE>我希望同居风波赶紧过去
<2-3,CASTLE>I was just hoping this whole thing would blow over.

83
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,350
<2-3,CASTLE>她会发现派是没有野心的嬉皮士
<2-3,CASTLE>She would see Pi for the ambition-free hippie

84
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,380
<2-3,CASTLE>而他现在变成了不着调的新世纪十字军
<2-3,CASTLE>that he is, and now he's morphed into some kind of new age crusader.

85
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:17,790
<2-3,CASTLE>就好像是他把做一个迷人的男孩变成了一种职业
<2-3,CASTLE>It's as though he's turned being a charming man-child into a career.

86
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,720
<2-4,BECKETT>那听起来还真是"不耳熟"啊
<2-4,BECKETT>Yeah, that doesn't sound familiar, does it?

87
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,680
<2-5,CASTLE>我需要一起超赞谋杀案  这样我就不会纠结那事了
<2-5,CASTLE>What I need is a good murder so I can stop obsessing.

88
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,700
<2-6,KEVIN RYAN>我们满足你的要求  卡塞尔
<2-6,KEVIN RYAN>Well, we got one for you, Castle.

89
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:27,760
<2-6,KEVIN RYAN>死者名叫苏珊娜·里奇兰德  28岁
<2-6,KEVIN RYAN>Our victim is Susannah Richland, 28.

90
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:30,490
<2-6,KEVIN RYAN>名片上写着她是会计
<2-6,KEVIN RYAN>Business card says she's an accountant.

91
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:40,070
<2-7,CASTLE>会计怎么会搞成这样
<2-7,CASTLE>How does an accountant end up like this?

92
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:41,620
<2-8,LANIE PARISH>很恐怖吧
<2-8,LANIE PARISH>Freaky, huh?

93
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:44,260
<2-9,CASTLE>看看她手上的标记  看起来像圣痕
<2-9,CASTLE>Look at those marks on her hand. They look like stigmata.

94
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,810
<2-10,RYAN>她摆的姿势像是被钉在十字架上
<2-10,RYAN>Yeah, the way she's posed might suggest a crucifixion.

95
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,240
<2-11,LANIE>不过死因
<2-11,LANIE>Except the cause of death

96
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,500
<2-11,LANIE>是喉咙上的刺伤
<2-11,LANIE>is probably that stab wound to the throat

97
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:54,260
<2-11,LANIE>-这是双刃剑造成的  比如说匕首  -匕首
<2-11,LANIE>- from a double-edged blade like a dagger. - A dagger?

98
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,900
<2-12,CASTLE>也许这是某种仪式性献祭
<2-12,CASTLE>Maybe this is some kind of ritualistic sacrifice.

99
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,920
<2-13,BECKETT>也许是凶手故意为之
<2-13,BECKETT>Or maybe the killer wanted to make it look like it was.

100
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,400
<2-14,LANIE>由于现场缺少血迹  我认为她是在别处被杀
<2-14,LANIE>Note the lack of blood. I'd say she was moved here

101
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,060
<2-14,LANIE>然后移到这里来的
<2-14,LANIE>but killed somewhere else.

102
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:07,290
<2-15,CASTLE>我能不能推测是祭坛
<2-15,CASTLE>Might I suggest a sacrificial altar?

103
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,440
<2-16,BECKETT>不行
<2-16,BECKETT>No, you may not.

104
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,420
<2-16,BECKETT>死亡时间
<2-16,BECKETT>Do we have a time of death?

105
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:12,680
<2-17,LANIE>我推断是晚十点到午夜
<2-17,LANIE>I'm thinking 10:00 to midnight.

106
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,510
<2-18,RYAN>好吧  我开始排查
<2-18,RYAN>All right, uh, I'll start a canvass

107
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:16,130
<2-18,RYAN>收集监控录像
<2-18,RYAN>and start gathering security video,

108
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,300
<2-18,RYAN>看有没有人目睹了弃尸过程
<2-18,RYAN>see if I can find someone who witnessed the body drop.

109
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,570
<2-19,BECKETT>联系联调局
<2-19,BECKETT>Yeah, and get ahold of the FBI,

110
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:22,100
<2-19,BECKETT>看他们那里有没有相同作案手法的凶杀案
<2-19,BECKETT>see if they have any other murders with the same M.O.

111
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:25,300
<2-21,JAVIER ESPOSITO>-好  -刚跟苏珊娜的老板通完电话
<2-21,JAVIER ESPOSITO>- Yeah, okay. - Just got off the phone with Susannah's boss.

112
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,400
<2-21,JAVIER ESPOSITO>他想不明白她怎么会遇害
<2-21,JAVIER ESPOSITO>He knows of nothing in her life that would explain this.

113
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,480
<2-21,JAVIER ESPOSITO>但他说她最近行为举止有些怪异
<2-21,JAVIER ESPOSITO>But he did say she'd been acting odd lately

114
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:30,730
<2-21,JAVIER ESPOSITO>她还请了一周假
<2-21,JAVIER ESPOSITO>and that she'd asked for a week off

115
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:32,090
<2-21,JAVIER ESPOSITO>去处理私事
<2-21,JAVIER ESPOSITO>to handle a personal matter.

116
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:33,250
<2-22,CASTLE>他知道是什么私事吗
<2-22,CASTLE>And he didn't know what it was?

117
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,840
<2-23,ESPOSITO>不知道  她的同事也都不知道
<2-23,ESPOSITO>No. Neither did any of her co-workers.

118
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,220
<2-24,BECKETT>联系死者的家人朋友
<2-24,BECKETT>All right, contact her family and friends.

119
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,000
<2-24,BECKETT>看他们知不知道
<2-24,BECKETT>Let's see if they knew.

120
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,310
<2-24,BECKETT>-我和卡塞尔去她家  -好的
<2-24,BECKETT>- Castle and I are gonna go to her apartment. - All right.

121
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:43,110
<3-1,CASTLE>你知道她最近
<3-1,CASTLE>Did you know of any personal matters

122
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,150
<3-1,CASTLE>在处理什么私事吗
<3-1,CASTLE>she might have been dealing with?

123
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,730
<3-2,LANDLADY>不知道  但肯定出事了
<3-2,LANDLADY>No, but something was up.

124
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:48,850
<3-2,LANDLADY>上周开始  她的作息变得很不规律  经常晚归
<3-2,LANDLADY>Last week, she started keeping odd hours, staying out too late.

125
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:49,670
<3-2,LANDLADY>不是她的风格
<3-2,LANDLADY>It wasn't like her.

126
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:52,530
<3-3,BECKETT>她家里来客人吗  有男朋友吗
<3-3,BECKETT>Did she have any visitors, any men in her life?

127
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:53,660
<3-4,LANDLADY>我没见过
<3-4,LANDLADY>Not that I ever saw.

128
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:57,640
<3-4,LANDLADY>-查完记得锁门  -谢谢
<3-4,LANDLADY>- Be sure to lock up when you're done. - Thanks.

129
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,510
<3-4,LANDLADY>一位看起来普通的会计
<3-4,LANDLADY>An apparently ordinary accountant

130
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:05,490
<3-4,LANDLADY>被残忍杀害  尸体根据仪式摆放
<3-4,LANDLADY>brutally slain and ritually posed,

131
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:07,620
<4-1,CASTLE>被害前忙于处理私事
<4-1,CASTLE>all while tending to a personal matter

132
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:09,200
<4-2,BECKETT>行迹诡秘
<4-2,BECKETT>shrouded in secrecy.

133
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,750
<4-2,BECKETT>哪有诡秘
<4-2,BECKETT>It's not shrouded in secrecy.

134
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,400
<4-2,BECKETT>只是还不知道是什么事而已
<4-2,BECKETT>We just don't know what it is yet.

135
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:14,990
<4-3,CASTLE>我的版本更具戏剧色彩
<4-3,CASTLE>My version has more dramatic flair.

136
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:17,190
<4-4,CASTLE>她家有很多有关中世纪史的书籍
<4-4,CASTLE>She's got a lot of books here on medieval history.

137
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:19,640
<4-4,CASTLE>也许她的阴暗秘密
<4-4,CASTLE>Maybe her dark secret

138
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,360
<4-4,CASTLE>跟黑暗时期[欧洲中世纪]有关系
<4-4,CASTLE>has something to do with the Dark Ages.

139
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:23,660
<4-4,CASTLE>那就解释了她尸体的姿势
<4-4,CASTLE>That could explain the way we found her body.

140
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,830
<4-5,BECKETT>卡塞尔  可能让你说对了
<4-5,BECKETT>Castle, you might be on to something.

141
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:28,810
<4-6,BECKETT>看这个
<4-6,BECKETT>Look at this.

142
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:32,160
<4-6,BECKETT>宗教图标和异教符号
<4-6,BECKETT>Religious icons and pagan symbols.

143
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:34,200
<4-7,CASTLE>她是最近才迷上这种东西的
<4-7,CASTLE>This fascination of hers is recent.

144
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,360
<4-7,CASTLE>这些书都是三天前从图书馆借出的
<4-7,CASTLE>All these books were checked out of the library three days ago.

145
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,710
<4-8,BECKETT>那跟她的凶杀案有什么关系
<4-8,BECKETT>Okay, so what does that have to do with her murder?

146
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,190
<4-9,CASTLE>我可能知道答案
<4-9,CASTLE>I think I know the answer.

147
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:42,800
<4-9,CASTLE>五角星形  灵眼
<4-9,CASTLE>The pentagram, the all-seeing eye--

148
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,790
<4-9,CASTLE>都是黑魔法中的供能对象
<4-9,CASTLE>both of those are power objects in dark magic.

149
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:46,950
<4-9,CASTLE>这些元素  土  气
<4-9,CASTLE>All these elements-- earth, air,

150
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:50,730
<4-9,CASTLE>火  水  以太  都是
<4-9,CASTLE>fire, water, ether-- all medieval symbols

151
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:53,180
<4-9,CASTLE>与邪恶法术有关的中世纪符号
<4-9,CASTLE>that are sometimes associated with satanic practices.

152
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:55,290
<4-9,CASTLE>苏珊娜迷上了神秘学
<4-9,CASTLE>Susannah was into the occult.

153
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,760
<5-1,HENRY COLLINS>神秘学  我了解我表妹
<5-1,HENRY COLLINS>The occult? I know my cousin.

154
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,600
<5-1,HENRY COLLINS>她不会跟这种事扯上关系的
<5-1,HENRY COLLINS>No way was she mixed up with that kind of thing.

155
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:04,300
<5-2,ESPOSITO>我们在她家找到了这些符号  柯林斯先生
<5-2,ESPOSITO>Well, we found these symbols at her place, Mr. Collins,

156
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,380
<5-2,ESPOSITO>以及有关中世纪史的书籍
<5-2,ESPOSITO>along with some books on medieval history.

157
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:08,240
<5-2,ESPOSITO>知道她怎么会有这些东西吗
<5-2,ESPOSITO>Any idea why they'd be there?

158
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:12,080
<5-3,HENRY>不知道  她很热衷历史
<5-3,HENRY>No. I mean, she was a history buff,

159
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,340
<5-3,HENRY>但多是美国历史  不是那种
<5-3,HENRY>but more American history, not that kind of thing.

160
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,420
<5-4,ESPOSITO>她跟人结过怨吗  柯林斯先生
<5-4,ESPOSITO>Did she have any, uh, enemies in her life, Mr. Collins?

161
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,130
<5-4,ESPOSITO>或者情感危机
<5-4,ESPOSITO>Any relationship issues?

162
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,600
<5-5,HENRY>应该没有
<5-5,HENRY>Not that I know of.

163
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,400
<5-5,HENRY>我不明白谁会杀害她
<5-5,HENRY>I just--I don't understand who would do this to her.

164
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,390
<5-6,ESPOSITO>你最后一次见她是什么时候
<5-6,ESPOSITO>When was the last time you saw her?

165
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,330
<5-7,HENRY>大概  三周前吧
<5-7,HENRY>Maybe... three weeks ago.

166
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,160
<5-7,HENRY>我是她唯一的亲人
<5-7,HENRY>I was her only family,

167
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,410
<5-7,HENRY>所以我们每隔几个月就一起共进晚餐
<5-7,HENRY>so we'd get together for dinner every few months.

168
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,730
<5-7,HENRY>但奇怪的是  她
<5-7,HENRY>But it's strange. She, um...

169
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:38,870
<5-7,HENRY>她昨晚突然给我打电话
<5-7,HENRY>She actually called me last night out of the blue.

170
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:40,680
<5-8,ESPOSITO>她说什么了
<5-8,ESPOSITO>And what did she say?

171
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,320
<5-9,HENRY>她说有些话要跟我说
<5-9,HENRY>That she had something that she wanted to talk to me about.

172
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:45,890
<5-10,ESPOSITO>什么话
<5-10,ESPOSITO>What was that?

173
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:47,360
<5-11,HENRY>我还没来得及问
<5-11,HENRY>I didn't even get a chance to ask.

174
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,390
<5-11,HENRY>她被人打断了
<5-11,HENRY>She got interrupted or something,

175
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,810
<5-11,HENRY>说回头打给我
<5-11,HENRY>said she'd call me right back,

176
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,040
<5-11,HENRY>却她没回电
<5-11,HENRY>but she never did.

177
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,380
<5-11,HENRY>现在我知道原因了
<5-11,HENRY>But now I know why.

178
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,070
<6-1,BECKETT>联调局数据库里没有符合本案
<6-1,BECKETT>So the FBI doesn't have any murders in their database

179
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,390
<6-1,BECKETT>作案手法的凶案
<6-1,BECKETT>that match this M.O.

180
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,180
<6-2,CASTLE>那就剩我的理论了
<6-2,CASTLE>Which leaves us with my theory--

181
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,350
<6-2,CASTLE>死者想涉猎黑魔法
<6-2,CASTLE>our victim was dabbling with black magic,

182
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:08,690
<6-2,CASTLE>却召唤来了恶魔
<6-2,CASTLE>and she conjured up a demon.

183
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:12,360
<6-3,BECKETT>或者她跟某个隐晦的宗教派别发生了冲突
<6-3,BECKETT>Or maybe she ran afoul of some obscure religious sect,

184
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,300
<6-3,BECKETT>-他们将她献给了自己的异教神  -你在干什么
<6-3,BECKETT>- and they sacrificed her to their pagan deity. - What are you doing?

185
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,500
<6-5,BECKETT>瞎编乱造  跟你一样
<6-5,BECKETT>Making stuff up, just like you do.

186
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,750
<6-6,CASTLE>那是我的工作
<6-6,CASTLE>Yeah, because that's my job.

187
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,000
<6-6,CASTLE>你得追查证据
<6-6,CASTLE>It's your job to follow the evidence.

188
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,770
<6-6,CASTLE>你这是在破坏自然秩序
<6-6,CASTLE>You're messing with the natural order of things.

189
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,590
<6-7,RYAN>伙计们  过来看点东西
<6-7,RYAN>Hey, guys? Something you need to see.

190
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:26,050
<7-1,RYAN>现场排查没找到
<7-1,RYAN>So our canvass couldn't come up with anyone

191
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:28,820
<7-1,RYAN>目睹弃尸的人  但苏珊娜
<7-1,RYAN>who witnessed the body dump, but Susannah had

192
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,220
<7-1,RYAN>口袋里有张交通卡
<7-1,RYAN>a metrocard in her pocket.

193
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:31,940
<7-1,RYAN>我让纽约大都会运输署查了记录
<7-1,RYAN>So I had M.T.A. run its history.

194
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:34,690
<7-1,RYAN>她的卡昨晚在一辆M3公交车上刷过
<7-1,RYAN>Her card was swiped last night on an M3 bus.

195
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:36,380
<7-1,RYAN>她8点45分在家附近上车
<7-1,RYAN>She got on it at 8:45 near her apartment.

196
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,250
<7-2,BECKETT>去哪
<7-2,BECKETT>Where was she going?

197
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:40,210
<7-3,RYAN>公交车摄像头拍到她出现在华盛顿高地的
<7-3,RYAN>Bus cam has her exiting at West 168th Street

198
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,100
<7-3,RYAN>168西街
<7-3,RYAN>Washington Heights.

199
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:43,160
<7-4,CASTLE>那离陈尸现场就半英里左右
<7-4,CASTLE>That's about a half mile from where her body was found.

200
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,460
<7-5,BECKETT>她去那里干什么
<7-5,BECKETT>What was she doing way up there?

201
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,110
<7-5,BECKETT>不知道
<7-5,BECKETT>I don't know.

202
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:47,970
<7-6,RYAN>但我查了附近十个街区的交通监控录像
<7-6,RYAN>But I checked traffic cam footage in a 10-block radius,

203
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:50,670
<7-6,RYAN>发现苏珊娜在173西街
<7-6,RYAN>and I found Susannah crossing St. Nicholas

204
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:53,080
<7-6,RYAN>穿过圣尼古拉斯街
<7-6,RYAN>at West 173rd Street.

205
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:56,360
<7-6,RYAN>看来还有人跟着她
<7-6,RYAN>And it looks like she had company.

206
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,100
<7-8,RYAN>-修道士  -看下时间戳  10点05分
<7-8,RYAN>- A monk? - Check out the time stamp-- 10:05,

207
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,710
<7-8,RYAN>-就在死亡时间区里  -被刻意摆放过的尸体
<7-8,RYAN>- right in our time-of-death window. - A posed body,

208
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,970
<7-9,CASTLE>神秘的中世纪符号  现在又来了个凶残的修道士
<7-9,CASTLE>mysterious medieval symbols, and now a murderous monk.

209
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,800
<7-9,CASTLE>现实版的《达芬奇密码》啊
<7-9,CASTLE>It's a real life "Da Vinci code."

219
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,410
<8-1,BECKETT>这人的身份我们有线索吗
<8-1,BECKETT>Do we have any idea who this guy is?

220
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:22,770
<8-2,CASTLE>我来告诉你他是谁吧
<8-2,CASTLE>I'll tell you who he is.

221
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:25,460
<8-2,CASTLE>他是一个刺客团体的成员
<8-2,CASTLE>He's part of a brotherhood of assassins,

222
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:27,850
<8-2,CASTLE>被选中去保卫一个古老的秘密
<8-2,CASTLE>chosen to guard an ancient secret.

223
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:30,480
<8-4,CASTLE>-卡塞尔  -跟踪一个对中世纪符号着迷的女人
<8-4,CASTLE>- Castle...  - stalking a woman obsessed with medieval symbols?

224
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,730
<8-4,CASTLE>这就是证据显示出的事实
<8-4,CASTLE>This is what the evidence suggests.

225
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,190
<8-5,BECKETT>他的脸有更清楚点的镜头吗
<8-5,BECKETT>Can we get a closer look at his face?

226
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,420
<8-6,RYAN>他没抬过头
<8-6,RYAN>He never turns his head.

227
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,170
<8-7,BECKETT>等等  把他头顶放大
<8-7,BECKETT>Wait. Zoom in on his scalp.

228
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,810
<8-7,BECKETT>那儿  看到了吗
<8-7,BECKETT>There. You see that?

229
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,040
<8-8,CASTLE>宗教印记
<8-8,CASTLE>Ritual markings,

230
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:46,440
<8-8,CASTLE>是对一些不虔诚行为的惩罚
<8-8,CASTLE>Left by some unholy initiation.

231
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,010
<8-9,BECKETT>更像是外科手术的疤痕吧
<8-9,BECKETT>They're more like surgical scars.

232
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,830
<8-10,RYAN>我去查查一些医疗程序  看有没有
<8-10,RYAN>I'll see if I can look into a medical procedure

233
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,620
<8-10,RYAN>能造成这种疤痕的  也许能帮我们确定他的身份
<8-10,RYAN>that could cause this. Might help us I.D. him.

234
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,810
<9-1,CASTLE>我跟你说  修道士  被害人  还有这些符号
<9-1,CASTLE>I'm telling you, our monk, our victim, and these symbols

235
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:58,930
<9-1,CASTLE>彼此是由联系的
<9-1,CASTLE>are all connected.

236
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:01,860
<9-1,CASTLE>我打赌苏珊娜·里奇兰德破译了这些符号
<9-1,CASTLE>I'm betting Susannah Richland decoded these symbols

237
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:03,950
<9-1,CASTLE>发现了一些黑暗的  尘封已久的秘密
<9-1,CASTLE>and uncovered some dark, long-held secret,

238
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,490
<9-1,CASTLE>于是付出了生命的代价
<9-1,CASTLE>paid for it with her life.

239
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:08,060
<9-2,BECKETT>听着  卡塞尔  我同意她最近
<9-2,BECKETT>Look, Castle, I agree that her recent interest

240
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:09,390
<9-2,BECKETT>对于这些符号的无端痴迷
<9-2,BECKETT>in all things medieval

241
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,960
<9-2,BECKETT>也许和案情有关  但这并不意味着
<9-2,BECKETT>may be relevant, but it doesn't mean

242
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,260
<9-2,BECKETT>她是因为某些狗血事件而被害
<9-2,BECKETT>that she was killed in some baroque plot.

243
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,600
<9-3,ESPOSITO>要我就不会那么肯定
<9-3,ESPOSITO>Well, I wouldn't be too sure about that.

244
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:17,610
<9-3,ESPOSITO>关于《达芬奇密码》的说法  卡塞尔可能说对了
<9-3,ESPOSITO>Castle might be right about this "Da Vinci code" thing.

245
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,730
<9-4,ESPOSITO>别蹬鼻子上脸
<9-4,ESPOSITO>Don't... ruin it.

246
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:21,600
<9-4,ESPOSITO>苏珊娜的电话记录显示
<9-4,ESPOSITO>According to Susannah's phone records,

247
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,420
<9-4,ESPOSITO>她死前当天曾给哈德逊大学的
<9-4,ESPOSITO>she made a call to a professor Jason Byford

248
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,530
<9-4,ESPOSITO>杰森·拜福德教授打过电话
<9-4,ESPOSITO>at Hudson University the day before she died,

249
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:27,690
<9-4,ESPOSITO>还有更劲爆的
<9-4,ESPOSITO>and get this.

250
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:30,290
<9-4,ESPOSITO>他是古代语言和符号的专家
<9-4,ESPOSITO>He's an expert in ancient languages and symbology.

251
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:31,990
<9-5,CASTLE>就像影片中的汤姆·汉克斯
<9-5,CASTLE>Just like Tom Hanks in the movie.

252
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,170
<9-5,CASTLE>不是狗血事件  这明明是畅销书的情节
<9-5,CASTLE>It's not a baroque plot. It's a bestseller plot.

253
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:35,880
<9-6,BECKETT>最起码  他应该能告诉我们
<9-6,BECKETT>Well, at the very least, he should be able to tell us

254
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:37,280
<9-6,BECKETT>苏珊娜到底目的何在
<9-6,BECKETT>what Susannah was up to.

255
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:38,640
<9-6,BECKETT>我和卡塞尔去找他聊聊
<9-6,BECKETT>Castle and I will go talk to him.

256
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,560
<9-6,BECKETT>另外  我需要你去一趟陈尸间
<9-6,BECKETT>In the meantime, I need you to go to the morgue.

257
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,640
<9-6,BECKETT>-蕾妮说她有发现  -好
<9-6,BECKETT>- Lanie says she has something.  - Okay.

258
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:45,770
<10-1,LANIE>我终于确定凶器是什么了
<10-1,LANIE>So I was finally able to identify the murder weapon.

259
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,550
<10-2,ESPOSITO>你之前不是说是把匕首吗
<10-2,ESPOSITO>Thought you said it was a dagger.

260
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,320
<10-3,LANIE>我知道我说过什么
<10-3,LANIE>I know what I said, but based on

261
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:51,800
<10-3,LANIE>但从伤口的弧度和她颈部的伤痕来看
<10-3,LANIE>the curvature of the wound and the injuries to her neck,

262
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,880
<10-3,LANIE>被害人是被一把剑刺死
<10-3,LANIE>our victim was stabbed with a sword.

263
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,050
<10-5,LANIE>-剑  -没错  类似这样的双刃剑
<10-5,LANIE>- A sword?  - Yes, a double-edged sabre like this...

264
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:01,470
<10-5,LANIE>剑柄在她颈部留下了淤痕
<10-5,LANIE>With a hilt that left a crenelated bruising pattern on her neck.

265
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,750
<10-6,ESPOSITO>还真复古啊
<10-6,ESPOSITO>Very old school.

266
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:05,680
<10-7,LANIE>我仔细查看了她手部的伤痕
<10-7,LANIE>I took a closer look at her hand injuries,

267
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,840
<10-7,LANIE>发现了一些东西
<10-7,LANIE>and I found something.

268
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:09,520
<10-7,LANIE>她手掌的伤口中有墨水的残留
<10-7,LANIE>There was ink residue in this wound on her palm.

269
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,380
<10-7,LANIE>我根据下层真皮留下的痕迹画出了这个
<10-7,LANIE>I was able to draw it up from the lower dermis.

270
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:15,110
<10-7,LANIE>看起来是她在手上画了这个符号
<10-7,LANIE>It looks like she drew this symbol on her hand.

271
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:16,840
<10-8,ESPOSITO>我得把这个给贝克特看看
<10-8,ESPOSITO>All right. I gotta get this to Beckett.

272
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,870
<10-8,ESPOSITO>我得赶紧回局里了
<10-8,ESPOSITO>Head back to the precinct.

273
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,620
<11-1,PROFESSOR JASON BYFORD>是的  我见过苏珊娜
<11-1,PROFESSOR JASON BYFORD>Yes, I met with Susannah.

274
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,710
<11-1,PROFESSOR JASON BYFORD>经常有人打来问一些研究问题
<11-1,PROFESSOR JASON BYFORD>People often call with research questions,

275
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:24,760
<11-1,PROFESSOR JASON BYFORD>我希望能帮上忙
<11-1,PROFESSOR JASON BYFORD>so I try to be helpful.

276
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,570
<11-1,PROFESSOR JASON BYFORD>她想知道这些符号的含义
<11-1,PROFESSOR JASON BYFORD>She wanted to know what these symbols meant.

277
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,910
<11-2,CASTLE>-你怎么说的  -我说要视情况而定
<11-2,CASTLE>- What did you tell her?  - I said that it all depends.

278
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,480
<11-3,BYFORD>这些符号有的已经存在上千年了
<11-3,BYFORD>Some of these have existed for thousands of years.

279
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,270
<11-3,BYFORD>在不同的文化中有着不同的含义
<11-3,BYFORD>They signify different things to different cultures.

280
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,840
<11-4,BECKETT>这些符号与危险的东西有关的吗  比如邪教
<11-4,BECKETT>Are any of them tied to anything dangerous, like cults?

281
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,370
<11-5,BYFORD>是有一些
<11-5,BYFORD>Hmm, a few, yes,

282
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:40,540
<11-5,BYFORD>不过大部分都与共济会有关
<11-5,BYFORD>but mostly, these are associated with the freemasons,

283
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:43,430
<11-5,BYFORD>所以在美国的建筑和图标中才会这么常见
<11-5,BYFORD>which is why you see so many on buildings and icons in the U.S.

284
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:45,510
<11-6,CASTLE>我们的很多开国元勋都是共济会成员
<11-6,CASTLE>A lot of our founding fathers were freemasons.

285
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,990
<11-7,BECKETT>我知道  我看过《国家宝藏》
<11-7,BECKETT>Yes. I saw "National treasure."

286
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:49,610
<11-8,BYFORD>我也是  真遗憾
<11-8,BYFORD>As did I, sadly.

287
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,850
<11-8,BYFORD>不少可恶的事实错误
<11-8,BYFORD>Some odious factual errors.

288
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,730
<11-8,BYFORD>不过在美国独立战争期间
<11-8,BYFORD>Though it is true that during the american revolution,

289
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:56,600
<11-8,BYFORD>的确有些类似的符号
<11-8,BYFORD>symbols like these were used as markers

290
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,620
<11-8,BYFORD>被用作战争机密和掩埋宝藏的标记
<11-8,BYFORD>for war secrets and buried treasure.

291
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,290
<11-9,CASTLE>宝藏
<11-9,CASTLE>Treasure?

292
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:03,270
<11-10,BYFORD>比如英国战败后
<11-10,BYFORD>Like the British gold left behind

293
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:05,940
<11-10,BYFORD>留下的那些金币  或是美国国库首批铸造的钱币中
<11-10,BYFORD>when they lost the war or the missing half dimes...

294
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,950
<11-10,BYFORD>遗失的那一半
<11-10,BYFORD>the first coins minted by the U.S. Treasury.

295
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:11,090
<11-11,BECKETT>教授  苏珊娜问过你这个符号吗
<11-11,BECKETT>Professor, did Susannah ask you about this symbol?

296
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:15,240
<11-12,BYFORD>应该没有  怎么了
<11-12,BYFORD>I don't believe so. Why?

297
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:17,410
<11-13,BECKETT>她昨晚被杀了
<11-13,BECKETT>She was killed last night,

298
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,690
<11-13,BECKETT>我们认为所有这些符号都与之相关
<11-13,BECKETT>And we believe all of these symbols are relevant.

299
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:20,740
<11-14,BYFORD>被杀
<11-14,BYFORD>Killed?

300
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,300
<11-15,BECKETT>怎么了
<11-15,BECKETT>What is it?

301
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:27,300
<11-16,BYFORD>有些东西你们得看看
<11-16,BYFORD>Uh, um, there's something you need to see.

302
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,240
<12-1,BYFORD>她带着这封信来的
<12-1,BYFORD>She had this letter with her.

303
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,440
<12-1,BYFORD>她想知道它是否能与这些符号联系起来
<12-1,BYFORD>She wanted to know if it was connected to the symbols.

304
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,600
<12-1,BYFORD>我从没见过这类东西
<12-1,BYFORD>Now I'd never seen anything quite like it,

305
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,110
<12-1,BYFORD>所以我...
<12-1,BYFORD>so I, uh, I, um,

306
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:38,160
<12-1,BYFORD>我趁她不注意的时候偷拍了一张照片
<12-1,BYFORD>well, I snuck a picture of it while she wasn't looking.

307
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,740
<12-2,CASTLE>"我  纽约城的西奥多·罗斯
<12-2,CASTLE>"I, Theodore Rose, of New York City,

308
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,730
<12-2,CASTLE>"一个身心健康的忠诚爱国者
<12-2,CASTLE>"a loyal patriot of sound mind and body,

309
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:44,910
<12-2,CASTLE>...这将成为我的临终遗嘱"
<12-2,CASTLE>do the..to make this my last will and testament."

310
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,610
<12-3,BYFORD>西奥多·罗斯是十八世纪的著名石匠
<12-3,BYFORD>Theodore Rose was an 18th-century stonemason

311
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:49,180
<12-3,BYFORD>不过这可不只是一份遗嘱
<12-3,BYFORD>of some renown, but it's more than a will.

312
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,090
<12-3,BYFORD>继续读  这里
<12-3,BYFORD>Keep reading. Here.

313
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:52,100
<12-4,CASTLE>"我将把钥匙传给后世
<12-4,CASTLE>"So I pass to them still living this key

314
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,570
<12-4,CASTLE>"它将指向我们的大秘密
<12-4,CASTLE>"which marks the way to our great secret,

315
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:55,880
<12-4,CASTLE>藏在城市之中
<12-4,CASTLE>enshrined within the city."

316
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,740
<12-4,CASTLE>而这封信就是找到它的关键
<12-4,CASTLE>And this letter is the key to finding it.

317
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:58,610
<12-5,BECKETT>她从哪里搞到这信的
<12-5,BECKETT>Where did she get it?

318
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:01,240
<12-6,BYFORD>她没说  不过从日期和封印上看
<12-6,BYFORD>She didn't say, but according to the date and seal,

319
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,760
<12-6,BYFORD>这信写于1798年
<12-6,BYFORD>It was written in 1798.

320
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,470
<12-7,BECKETT>那些拉丁文是什么意思
<12-7,BECKETT>And the latin phrases-- what do they mean?

321
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:06,520
<12-8,BYFORD>我帮她翻译了其中的一些
<12-8,BYFORD>Well, I translated some of them for her.

322
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,540
<12-8,BYFORD>貌似是某种谜语  这一句说
<12-8,BYFORD>They're riddles of some kind. This one says

323
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:11,950
<12-8,BYFORD>世界在天堂与埃土中翻转
<12-8,BYFORD>"The world turns between the heavens and the ash heap."

324
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:13,490
<12-9,CASTLE>这不是谜语  而是线索
<12-9,CASTLE>They're not riddles. They're clues--

325
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:16,220
<12-9,CASTLE>有关共济会宝藏的线索
<12-9,CASTLE>Clues leading to some great masonic treasure.

326
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,970
<12-9,CASTLE>最后一句话也许就是她遇害的原因
<12-9,CASTLE>And this last line could be why she was murdered.

327
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,980
<12-9,CASTLE>危险和灾难
<12-9,CASTLE>"Periculum et dolor..."

328
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,500
<12-9,CASTLE>我的拉丁文不太灵光  但这句应该是说
<12-9,CASTLE>My latin is pretty rusty, but I think that means

329
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,480
<12-10,BECKETT>谁若心生歹意
<12-10,BECKETT>"Peril and woe to him who follows this path

330
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:26,960
<12-10,BECKETT>必将遭遇不幸
<12-10,BECKETT>with a dark heart."

331
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,970
<12-11,RYAN>-我是贝克特  -那个修道士
<12-11,RYAN>- Beckett. - So that pattern

332
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:38,960
<12-11,RYAN>头上的伤疤是一种叫
<12-11,RYAN>of scars on our monk's dome was from a procedure called

333
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:41,440
<12-11,RYAN>脑立体定向术留下的
<12-11,RYAN>stereotactic brain surgery.

334
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,630
<12-12,BECKETT>能查到他是谁吗
<12-12,BECKETT>Okay, can that get us an I.D.?

335
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:44,480
<12-12,BECKETT>医疗记录应该是保密的吧
<12-12,BECKETT>Because medical records are confidential.

336
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,810
<12-13,RYAN>但监狱记录就不用保密了
<12-13,RYAN>Prison records aren't.

337
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:47,600
<12-13,RYAN>我猜测他入过狱
<12-13,RYAN>I took a shot that our guy did some time.

338
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,780
<12-13,RYAN>系统中有19个人曾动过这手术
<12-13,RYAN>19 men in the system had this surgery,

339
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:52,250
<12-13,RYAN>但只有一人的伤疤与这修道士
<12-13,RYAN>but only one had scars that were an exact match

340
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,550
<12-13,RYAN>完全吻合  本杰明·韦德
<12-13,RYAN>to the monk-- Benjamin Wade.

341
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,110
<12-13,RYAN>他在格林黑文坐牢期间
<12-13,RYAN>He got surgery to remove a tumor

342
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:57,760
<12-13,RYAN>为移除脑瘤做了这项手术
<12-13,RYAN>while doing a stretch at Green Haven

343
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,900
<12-13,RYAN>罪名是谋杀未遂
<12-13,RYAN>for attempted murder.

344
00:12:58,900 --> 00:12:59,870
<12-14,BECKETT>听到了吗  卡塞尔
<12-14,BECKETT>Hear that, Castle?

345
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:03,250
<12-14,BECKETT>嫌犯是前科犯  凶恶的修道士
<12-14,BECKETT>Our suspect is an ex-con-- a felonious monk.

346
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,490
<12-15,ESPOSITO>贝克特  没找到本杰明·韦德现在的住址
<12-15,ESPOSITO>Hey, Beckett, got no current address on Benjamin Wade,

347
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:08,280
<12-15,ESPOSITO>但他入狱之前在布朗克斯
<12-15,ESPOSITO>but he did have an apartment in the Bronx

348
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:09,320
<12-15,ESPOSITO>有一间公寓
<12-15,ESPOSITO>before he got sent to the joint.

349
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,620
<12-16,BECKETT>去查下  看谁知道他现在住哪
<12-16,BECKETT>Okay, check it out. See if anyone knows where he is now.

350
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,230
<13-1,ESPOSITO>我估计这里没人知道韦德的消息
<13-1,ESPOSITO>I don't think anyone here can give us a line on Wade.

351
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:19,060
<13-1,ESPOSITO>当地警察说这里都被
<13-1,ESPOSITO>Local P.D. Says this place has been taken over

352
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:21,140
<13-1,ESPOSITO>流浪汉和瘾君子占满了
<13-1,ESPOSITO>by squatters and crackheads.

353
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,310
<13-2,RYAN>看看这地方
<13-2,RYAN>Look at this place.

354
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:26,580
<13-2,RYAN>这空气吸一口都能让人得肝炎
<13-2,RYAN>We're gonna get hepatitis just breathing the air.

355
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:29,230
<13-3,ESPOSITO>就是这里  韦德以前住的地方
<13-3,ESPOSITO>This is it. It's where Wade used to live.

356
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:30,490
<13-4,RYAN>破烂的家
<13-4,RYAN>Home crack home.

357
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:37,150
<13-5,ESPOSITO>别管我
<13-5,ESPOSITO>Leave me alone!

358
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:39,200
<13-6,RYAN>别来烦我
<13-6,RYAN>I don't want you here.

359
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,220
<13-6,RYAN>-纽约警察  -谁来救救我
<13-6,RYAN>- N.Y.P.D. - Somebody help me.

360
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,190
<13-7,ESPOSITO>-警察  -警察  不许动
<13-7,ESPOSITO>- Police! - N.Y.P.D.! Don't move!

361
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,010
<13-8,RYAN>本杰明·韦德  你涉嫌谋杀被逮捕了
<13-8,RYAN>Benjamin Wade, you're under arrest for murder.

362
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,810
<14-1,BECKETT>认得她吗  韦德先生
<14-1,BECKETT>Recognize her, mr. Wade?

363
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:16,390
<14-2,BECKETT>这是你跟踪她的照片
<14-2,BECKETT>And this is you, stalking her

364
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:18,200
<14-2,BECKETT>就在她被杀之前
<14-2,BECKETT>shortly before she was killed.

365
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:19,520
<14-2,BECKETT>可以解释一下吗
<14-2,BECKETT>You care to explain?

366
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,410
<14-3,CASTLE>也许他立誓保持沉默了
<14-3,CASTLE>Maybe he took a vow of silence.

367
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:27,500
<14-3,CASTLE>沉默而凶狠
<14-3,CASTLE>You know, silent but deadly.

368
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,480
<14-4,BECKETT>前提是他真的是个修道士
<14-4,BECKETT>Assuming he's a real monk.

369
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,960
<14-5,WADE>事实上  我是修道士
<14-5,WADE>Actually, I am a monk.

370
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,260
<14-5,WADE>我只是学会了言前三思
<14-5,WADE>I've just learned to think before I speak.

371
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,870
<14-5,WADE>我出狱以后皈依了
<14-5,WADE>I joined the Franciscan Order of Perpetual Hope

372
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,870
<14-5,WADE>永福圣方济会
<14-5,WADE>after I left prison.

373
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,760
<14-6,BECKETT>你皈依的这家修道院
<14-6,BECKETT>This monastery that you're a part of--

374
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,810
<14-6,BECKETT>是不是正好在华盛顿高地呢
<14-6,BECKETT>does it happen to be in Washington Heights?

375
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:46,260
<14-6,BECKETT>我们就是在那里发现了苏珊娜·里奇兰德的尸体
<14-6,BECKETT>Because that's exactly where we found Susannah Richland,

376
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,300
<14-6,BECKETT>考虑到你的前科
<14-6,BECKETT>And given your record--

377
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,670
<14-7,WADE>我已经重新做人了
<14-7,WADE>Not that guy anymore.

378
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:53,220
<14-7,WADE>患脑瘤后  我获得了心灵上的觉悟
<14-7,WADE>After my brain tumor, I had a spiritual awakening.

379
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,020
<14-7,WADE>找到了人生的意义
<14-7,WADE>Found a purpose.

380
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,870
<14-8,BECKETT>那你在那烂房子里干什么
<14-8,BECKETT>Then what were you doing in a crack house?

381
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,070
<14-9,WADE>我是在照顾那些迷途的羔羊
<14-9,WADE>I was tending to the lost.

382
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,290
<14-9,WADE>我不是在跟踪这个女人
<14-9,WADE>Wasn't stalking this woman. I was...

383
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:02,820
<14-9,WADE>而是想保护她
<14-9,WADE>I was trying to protect her.

384
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:03,710
<14-10,CASTLE>保护她
<14-10,CASTLE>Protect her?

385
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:05,270
<14-11,WADE>我在修道礼堂里看到她
<14-11,WADE>I found her in a monastery chapel.

386
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:07,810
<14-11,WADE>她跪在祷告蜡烛旁边
<14-11,WADE>She was kneeling by the prayer candles.

387
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:10,320
<14-11,WADE>说这地方对她家有特殊意义
<14-11,WADE>Said the place was special to her family.

388
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,510
<14-11,WADE>于是我让她独自一人静静祷告
<14-11,WADE>So I left her to pray in peace,

389
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,770
<14-11,WADE>然后有人来了  棕色长发  戴眼镜
<14-11,WADE>and this guy shows up-- brown long hair, glasses.

390
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:19,340
<14-11,WADE>戴着帽子  向我打听那个女人
<14-11,WADE>He's wearing this hat. Starts asking me questions about her.

391
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,290
<14-11,WADE>想知道她在里面干什么  他很生气
<14-11,WADE>Wants to know what she's doing there. He's upset.

392
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:22,280
<14-11,WADE>看起来咄咄逼人
<14-11,WADE>He seems aggressive.

393
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,170
<14-12,BECKETT>韦德先生  是你在跟踪她
<14-12,BECKETT>Mr. Wade, that's you following her,

394
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,200
<14-12,BECKETT>可不是别的什么人
<14-12,BECKETT>not some other guy.

395
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,830
<14-13,WADE>我以为他会对她下手
<14-13,WADE>I thought that he was gonna go after her.

396
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,430
<14-13,WADE>所以我才跟着她  直到她上了计程车
<14-13,WADE>So I did. I followed her until she got into a cab,

397
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,120
<14-13,WADE>然后我就回到修道院
<14-13,WADE>and then I came back to the monastery.

398
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,070
<14-14,BECKETT>真的吗
<14-14,BECKETT>Really?

399
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,190
<14-14,BECKETT>好呀
<14-14,BECKETT>Okay.

400
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:38,460
<14-14,BECKETT>描述一下计程车吧
<14-14,BECKETT>Describe the cab.

401
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:40,080
<14-15,WADE>就是辆计程车而已
<14-15,WADE>It was a cab.

402
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,850
<14-16,BECKETT>车牌号  计程车号
<14-16,BECKETT>License plate. Medallion number.

403
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,300
<14-17,WADE>我不记得了  好像是辆
<14-17,WADE>I don't remember. It was a...

404
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,050
<14-17,WADE>丰田普锐斯吧
<14-17,WADE>Prius, maybe.

405
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:46,820
<14-18,CASTLE>这车可有好几百辆呢
<14-18,CASTLE>There are hundreds of those.

406
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:49,740
<14-18,CASTLE>会讲故事的人善于运用细节
<14-18,CASTLE>A good storyteller uses details.

407
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:51,010
<14-18,CASTLE>这样谎话才编得圆
<14-18,CASTLE>It's what sells the lie.

408
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:53,760
<14-19,WADE>我没撒谎  车顶有音乐剧《女巫前传》的广告
<14-19,WADE>It's not a lie. There was an ad for "Wicked" on top of it.

409
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,490
<14-20,CASTLE>《女巫前传》
<14-20,CASTLE>"Wicked."

410
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:59,000
<14-20,CASTLE>不错  很到位  泄露内心的小细节
<14-20,CASTLE>That's nice. It's precise. Freudian little detail.

411
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,130
<14-20,CASTLE>但仍是谎言
<14-20,CASTLE>But still a lie.

412
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,280
<15-1,ESPOSITO>有一点他倒没撒谎
<15-1,ESPOSITO>So here's what's not a lie.

413
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,020
<15-1,ESPOSITO>我给方济会打了电话
<15-1,ESPOSITO>Just called the Franciscan Order.

414
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,850
<15-1,ESPOSITO>本杰明·韦德的确是个修道士
<15-1,ESPOSITO>Turns out Benjamin Wade really is a monk.

415
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:07,750
<15-2,CASTLE>还是本案凶手
<15-2,CASTLE>And our murderer.

416
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,240
<15-3,BECKETT>只要能找到证据就好
<15-3,BECKETT>Now we just need to prove it.

417
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,010
<15-4,ESPOSITO>慢着  你俩对这个人看法一致
<15-4,ESPOSITO>Wait. You guys are on the same page about this guy?

418
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:13,830
<15-5,BECKETT>不完全一致  我认为他有罪
<15-5,BECKETT>Not exactly. I think he's guilty

419
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:15,450
<15-5,BECKETT>是因为他和被害人有关联
<15-5,BECKETT>because of his contact with the victim,

420
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:18,300
<15-5,BECKETT>他跟踪了她  外加他还有暴力史
<15-5,BECKETT>the stalking, and his history of violence.

421
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,580
<15-5,BECKETT>而我认为他有罪是因为他和被害人有关联
<15-5,BECKETT>I think he's guilty because of his contact with the victim,

422
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,510
<15-6,CASTLE>他跟踪了她  外加他还卷入了一桩
<15-6,CASTLE>the stalking, and his role in a sinister conspiracy

423
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,650
<15-6,CASTLE>和共济会有关的危险阴谋
<15-6,CASTLE>involving freemasons.

424
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,920
<15-7,BECKETT>我不敢相信你以为那封信是真的
<15-7,BECKETT>I can't believe you're really buying into that letter.

425
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,940
<15-7,BECKETT>你不相信才奇怪呢
<15-7,BECKETT>I can't believe you aren't.

426
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,090
<15-8,CASTLE>我调查了一下那封信的作者
<15-8,CASTLE>I did a little research into the author of our letter--

427
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:30,150
<15-8,CASTLE>西奥多·罗斯先生
<15-8,CASTLE>Mr. Theodore Rose.

428
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:33,490
<15-8,CASTLE>你知不知道他曾是共济会最高级长老
<15-8,CASTLE>Did you know he was a 33rd degree master mason?

429
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:37,080
<15-9,ESPOSITO>也就是说他是共济会的黑带级人物
<15-9,ESPOSITO>So that makes him, what, like a freemason black belt?

430
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,890
<15-10,CASTLE>比那还厉害  他是一位爱国间谍
<15-10,CASTLE>Way better than that. He was a patriot spy.

431
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:43,140
<15-10,CASTLE>他在独立战争时用密码和暗语传递信息
<15-10,CASTLE>He wrote codes and ciphers during the American Revolution,

432
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:46,060
<15-10,CASTLE>这就意味着这封信是找到
<15-10,CASTLE>meaning this letter could be the key to finding

433
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,790
<15-10,CASTLE>共济会至高机密的关键
<15-10,CASTLE>the great secret of the masons,

434
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:49,530
<15-10,CASTLE>而这机密就封存在这座城市里
<15-10,CASTLE>enshrined somewhere within the city.

435
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:50,690
<15-11,BECKETT>为啥  因为你巴不得这是真的
<15-11,BECKETT>Why? Because you want it to be?

436
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:52,270
<15-12,CASTLE>有点吧  再就是因为
<15-12,CASTLE>Partly, and because

437
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:53,690
<15-12,CASTLE>只有这套理论能解释得通
<15-12,CASTLE>it's the only story that makes sense.

438
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:56,310
<15-12,CASTLE>神秘兄弟会要确保罗斯的秘密
<15-12,CASTLE>Shadowy brotherhood guarding Rose's secret

439
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:57,620
<15-12,CASTLE>永不见天日
<15-12,CASTLE>for all eternity.

440
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,130
<15-12,CASTLE>苏珊娜查得太深
<15-12,CASTLE>Susannah got too close,

441
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:01,380
<15-12,CASTLE>所以他们派出修道士刺客杀她灭口
<15-12,CASTLE>so they sent their monk assassin to kill her.

442
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:04,170
<15-13,RYAN>说到这  韦德的律师来了
<15-13,RYAN>Yeah, about that--uh, Wade's lawyer's here.

443
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:06,570
<15-13,RYAN>他说我们要么起诉  要么放人
<15-13,RYAN>He says we need to charge his client or let him go.

444
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,450
<15-14,ESPOSITO>我们没有足够证据起诉他
<15-14,ESPOSITO>We don't have enough to charge him.

445
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:10,710
<15-15,BECKETT>不如先拖住他  等证据充足再说
<15-15,BECKETT>Why don't we try to keep him until we do?

446
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,740
<15-15,BECKETT>让韦德去见素描师
<15-15,BECKETT>Put Wade in with a sketch artist.

447
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,940
<15-15,BECKETT>让他描述一下
<15-15,BECKETT>Have him describe that guy

448
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:16,220
<15-15,BECKETT>他声称跟踪苏珊娜的那人的样貌
<15-15,BECKETT>that was supposedly stalking Susannah.

449
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,830
<15-15,BECKETT>这样我和卡塞尔就有足够时间
<15-15,BECKETT>That'll buy Castle and I enough time

450
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:19,180
<15-15,BECKETT>去戳穿他的不在场证明
<15-15,BECKETT>to tear his alibi apart,

451
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,710
<15-15,BECKETT>另外为谨慎起见
<15-15,BECKETT>and just to cover our bases,

452
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:22,690
<15-15,BECKETT>你去查一下韦德说的那辆出租车
<15-15,BECKETT>you look into that cab that wade described.

453
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:24,640
<15-16,RYAN>说真的  你想让我追查一辆
<15-16,RYAN>Really? You want me to track down a cab

454
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,850
<15-16,RYAN>顶着《女巫前传》广告的出租车
<15-16,RYAN>off a banner ad for "Wicked"?

455
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:27,610
<15-17,BECKETT>让我开开眼
<15-17,BECKETT>Impress me.

456
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,490
<15-18,RYAN>有时候我真希望她待在特区别回来
<15-18,RYAN>You know, there are times I wish she stayed in D.C.

457
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,230
<16-1,BROTHER SILAS MORA>抱歉  探长  但你的确弄错了
<16-1,BROTHER SILAS MORA>I'm sorry, detective, but you're wrong.

458
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:40,120
<16-1,BROTHER SILAS MORA>在这位年轻女士遇害的时段里
<16-1,BROTHER SILAS MORA>Brother Benjamin was in his quarters at the time you say

459
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,850
<16-1,BROTHER SILAS MORA>本杰明修士确实待在他的住处
<16-1,BROTHER SILAS MORA>this young woman was killed.

460
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:43,280
<16-2,BECKETT>有什么人能证明吗
<16-2,BECKETT>And can anyone else verify that?

461
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,510
<16-3,MORA>至少有七位本会成员看见他了
<16-3,MORA>At least seven other members of our order saw him.

462
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:50,420
<16-4,CASTLE>你们的使命究竟是什么
<16-4,CASTLE>And... what exactly is the mission of your order?

463
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,720
<16-5,MORA>帮助有需要的人
<16-5,MORA>To care for those in need,

464
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,590
<16-5,MORA>遵循并分享基督的教诲
<16-5,MORA>to live by and share the teachings of Christ.

465
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,240
<16-6,CASTLE>我认为你
<16-6,CASTLE>I think you

466
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:59,750
<16-6,CASTLE>忘了说"保卫惊天秘密"那部分了
<16-6,CASTLE>left out the part about protecting a great secret.

467
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:03,050
<16-7,MORA>恐怕我没明白您的意思
<16-7,MORA>I'm afraid I don't understand.

468
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,190
<16-8,CASTLE>装傻吗
<16-8,CASTLE>Don't you?

469
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:05,880
<16-9,MORA>我真没听明白
<16-9,MORA>No, I don't.

470
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,600
<16-10,BECKETT>那个  感谢你抽时间见我们
<16-10,BECKETT>Uh... thank you... so much for your time.

471
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:12,360
<16-11,CASTLE>"感谢你抽时间见我们"  这就完事了
<16-11,CASTLE>"Thank you for your time"? That's it?

472
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:14,300
<16-12,BECKETT>没错  直到我们拿到
<16-12,BECKETT>Yeah, until we get the statements

473
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,390
<16-12,BECKETT>那七个证人的证词
<16-12,BECKETT>from the seven other witnesses.

474
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,130
<16-13,CASTLE>听着  他们肯定口径一致
<16-13,CASTLE>Look, they're all gonna tell you the same thing.

475
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:17,950
<16-13,CASTLE>还不明白吗
<16-13,CASTLE>Don't you see?

476
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:20,840
<16-13,CASTLE>这些修道士  心往一块想  劲往一处使
<16-13,CASTLE>These monks--they're in it up to their hoods.

477
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:25,080
<16-13,CASTLE>除非  他们并非在保护这个秘密
<16-13,CASTLE>Unless... unless they're not protecting the great secret

478
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,450
<16-13,CASTLE>而是也在找寻它
<16-13,CASTLE>and they're actually trying to find it, too.

479
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:28,590
<16-13,CASTLE>因为  就像约柜一样
<16-13,CASTLE>Because, like the ark of the covenant,

480
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,730
<16-13,CASTLE>这个秘密是终极能量源
<16-13,CASTLE>it is a source of ultimate power.

481
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:32,340
<16-14,BECKETT>卡塞尔  这些修道士全都
<16-14,BECKETT>Castle, these monks took vows

482
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,920
<16-14,BECKETT>立下清贫  禁欲  服从之誓
<16-14,BECKETT>of poverty, chastity, and obedience.

483
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,830
<16-14,BECKETT>我可不认为他们图谋统治世界
<16-14,BECKETT>I don't see them trying to take over the world.

484
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:38,120
<16-15,CASTLE>世界
<16-15,CASTLE>World.

485
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:39,950
<16-16,BECKETT>怎么了
<16-16,BECKETT>What?

486
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,490
<16-16,BECKETT>西奥多·罗斯写的那封信
<16-16,BECKETT>Theodore Rose's letter.

487
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:46,660
<16-17,CASTLE>拉丁文写的线索
<16-17,CASTLE>There was that one clue in latin. Uh...

488
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,080
<16-17,CASTLE>"世界在天堂与埃土间翻转"
<16-17,CASTLE>"The world turns between the heavens and the ash heap."

489
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,590
<16-17,CASTLE>拉丁语中"埃土"这个词
<16-17,CASTLE>In latin, the word for "Ash heap"

490
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,400
<16-17,CASTLE>又指"祭坛"
<16-17,CASTLE>also means "Altar."

491
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,690
<16-17,CASTLE>那扇彩窗描绘的是天堂
<16-17,CASTLE>The heavens are depicted in that stained glass.

492
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,830
<16-18,BECKETT>那么祭坛肯定就在它下面
<16-18,BECKETT>And the altar is right underneath it.

493
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:02,360
<16-19,CASTLE>这些线索指引她到这里  但原因何在
<16-19,CASTLE>So the clues led her to this chapel, but why?

494
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,280
<16-20,BECKETT>那些祈祷蜡烛
<16-20,BECKETT>The prayer candles.

495
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,030
<16-20,BECKETT>这里肯定就是韦德说他发现
<16-20,BECKETT>So this must be where Wade

496
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:11,180
<16-20,BECKETT>苏珊娜跪祷的地方了
<16-20,BECKETT>said he found Susannah kneeling.

497
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:13,430
<16-20,BECKETT>卡塞尔  看这里
<16-20,BECKETT>Castle, look.

498
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,860
<16-20,BECKETT>有纹理刻在基座上
<16-20,BECKETT>There's something carved in that base stone.

499
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,400
<16-21,CASTLE>那就是她画在手上的图案
<16-21,CASTLE>That's the symbol she drew on her hand.

500
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,420
<16-21,CASTLE>那其它的线索
<16-21,CASTLE>So these other clues...

501
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:23,710
<16-22,BECKETT>肯定指向其它藏有这类图案的地点
<16-22,BECKETT>Must lead to other places where the symbols are hidden.

502
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:25,660
<16-22,BECKETT>-但这些图案又有什么意义  -听这段
<16-22,BECKETT>- But what are they for? - Listen to this.

503
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:29,620
<16-23,CASTLE>"无论天神凡人  皆难御神匠之击"
<16-23,CASTLE>"For gods and men alike doth lame Hephaestus strike."

504
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:32,400
<16-23,CASTLE>我明白了  我知道在哪了
<16-23,CASTLE>I know what that means. I know where that is.

505
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:34,270
<16-24,BECKETT>-你明白了  -没错  赫菲斯托斯
<16-24,BECKETT>- You do? - Yeah. Hephaestus was

506
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:35,480
<16-25,CASTLE>是希腊神话中的铁匠之神
<16-25,CASTLE>the Greek god of blacksmiths.

507
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,500
<16-25,CASTLE>他的熔铁炉就在埃特纳火山
<16-25,CASTLE>His forge was in Mount Etna.

508
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,680
<16-25,CASTLE>下曼哈顿区就有家老铁匠铺
<16-25,CASTLE>There's an old blacksmith's shop right here in Lower Manhattan

509
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,720
<16-25,CASTLE>名字就叫"埃特纳熔炉"
<16-25,CASTLE>called Etna's Forge.

510
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,980
<16-25,CASTLE>18世纪起就在那了
<16-25,CASTLE>It's been there since the 1700s.

511
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:45,770
<16-25,CASTLE>我知道是因为我和阿丽克西斯去过那
<16-25,CASTLE>I know because I was there with... Alexis.

512
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:48,970
<16-25,CASTLE>她三年级的实地考察  但肯定错不了
<16-25,CASTLE>It was... A field trip. Third grade, but that-- that's gotta be it.

513
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:50,500
<16-26,BECKETT>被害人是被剑刺死的
<16-26,BECKETT>Our victim was killed with a sword.

514
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,820
<16-26,BECKETT>如果那家老铁匠铺真的存在
<16-26,BECKETT>If there's an old blacksmith shop,

515
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,230
<16-26,BECKETT>没准凶杀现场就在那
<16-26,BECKETT>that could be our crime scene.

516
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:55,700
<16-27,CASTLE>一条人们为其厮杀的
<16-27,CASTLE>A clue trail to a freemason secret

517
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,140
<16-27,CASTLE>共济会秘密线索
<16-27,CASTLE>that people would kill for--

518
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:59,110
<16-27,CASTLE>这案子越来越有趣了
<16-27,CASTLE>This case just keeps getting better.

519
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:02,360
<17-1,CASTLE>或许本杰明·韦德那天夜里其实
<17-1,CASTLE>So maybe what Benjamin Wade actually did that night

520
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,890
<17-1,CASTLE>是跟踪苏珊娜到了铁匠铺
<17-1,CASTLE>was follow Susannah to this blacksmith shop.

521
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:06,720
<17-2,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我们还不知道她是否来过这里
<17-2,BECKETT>Castle, we don't even know if she was here.

522
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,110
<17-3,CASTLE>她肯定来过
<17-3,CASTLE>Oh, she was here, all right,

523
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:09,410
<17-3,CASTLE>马上就要解开谜团
<17-3,CASTLE>on the verge of solving the puzzle

524
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:11,250
<17-3,CASTLE>却在此时不幸早逝
<17-3,CASTLE>when her life was cut tragically short.

525
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,430
<17-3,CASTLE>就是这里
<17-3,CASTLE>This is the place.

526
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:14,470
<17-4,BECKETT>我从来不知道这里还有个铁匠铺
<17-4,BECKETT>I never knew this was here.

527
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:21,410
<17-4,BECKETT>太不可思议了
<17-4,BECKETT>Wow, this is incredible.

528
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:24,190
<18-1,BECKETT>不是应该有个讲解员
<18-1,BECKETT>Shouldn't there be a... docent

529
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:27,060
<18-1,BECKETT>或者满头大汗的人站在这里打铁吗
<18-1,BECKETT>or some sweaty guy hammering metal standing around?

530
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,050
<18-1,BECKETT>是啊
<18-1,BECKETT>Yeah.

531
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,590
<18-2,CASTLE>有人吗
<18-2,CASTLE>Hello?!

532
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,790
<18-2,CASTLE>这里有铁匠吗
<18-2,CASTLE>Is there a smithy hereabouts?

533
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:34,180
<18-2,CASTLE>我们千里迢迢来……
<18-2,CASTLE>We have traveled many a mile to the--

534
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,100
<18-2,CASTLE>这样很讨厌吗
<18-2,CASTLE>Is this annoying?

535
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,830
<18-3,BECKETT>是的  这样吧  我去后面查看一下
<18-3,BECKETT>Yeah. You know what? I'm gonna check in back.

536
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,260
<18-3,BECKETT>你在这里四处看看
<18-3,BECKETT>Why don't you take a look around here?

537
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,080
<18-3,BECKETT>如果这是我们要找的犯罪现场
<18-3,BECKETT>If this is our crime scene,

538
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,480
<18-3,BECKETT>可能会有挣扎的痕迹
<18-3,BECKETT>there might be signs of struggle.

539
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,380
<18-4,CASTLE>好
<18-4,CASTLE>Right.

540
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:48,660
<18-5,CASTLE>这个有了
<18-5,CASTLE>Have it...

541
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,130
<18-5,CASTLE>这个想要
<18-5,CASTLE>Want it...

542
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:51,580
<18-5,CASTLE>这个需要
<18-5,CASTLE>Need it...

543
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,010
<18-5,CASTLE>有了  需要
<18-5,CASTLE>Got it... need it...

544
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:56,550
<18-6,KENNY>你不应该来这里寻找符号
<18-6,KENNY>You should not have come here looking for the sign,

545
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,400
<18-6,KENNY>因为等待你的只有死亡
<18-6,KENNY>for only death awaits you.

546
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:04,410
<18-7,CASTLE>那个
<18-7,CASTLE>Well, now...

547
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,890
<18-7,CASTLE>你手里的不会刚好是一把有雉堞的
<18-7,CASTLE>That wouldn't happen to be a double-edged saber

548
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,850
<18-7,CASTLE>双刃佩剑吧
<18-7,CASTLE>with a crenelated hilt, now, would it?

549
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:17,710
<19-1,KENNY>你已闯入你无法理解的秘密
<19-1,KENNY>You have trespassed into secrets beyond your comprehension.

550
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,090
<19-1,KENNY>你将用生命为此付出代价
<19-1,KENNY>You will pay with your life.

551
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:22,430
<19-2,CASTLE>好吧  在你杀我之前
<19-2,CASTLE>Okay. O-okay, b-but just... before you kill me,

552
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:24,090
<19-2,CASTLE>有件事是你应该知道
<19-2,CASTLE>there's one thing you should know.

553
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,450
<19-3,KENNY>什么事
<19-3,KENNY>And what is that?

554
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:28,520
<19-4,CASTLE>我很擅长剑术
<19-4,CASTLE>I am really good at this.

555
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:36,600
<19-5,CASTLE>你也不差
<19-5,CASTLE>Uhh! You're not so bad yourself.

556
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,520
<19-5,CASTLE>你是谁
<19-5,CASTLE>Who are you?

557
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:40,700
<19-6,CASTLE>关于西奥多·罗斯遗愿  你知道些什么
<19-6,CASTLE>And what do you know about the last will of Theodore Rose?

558
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:43,710
<19-7,KENNY>两百年来我们守护着这个秘密
<19-7,KENNY>For 200 years, my people have guarded that secret.

559
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:46,690
<19-7,KENNY>这个秘密将被带进我的坟墓  或者你的
<19-7,KENNY>It will go with me to my grave... or yours!

560
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,640
<19-8,CASTLE>你是谁
<19-8,CASTLE>Now who are you?

561
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:14,330
<19-9,KENNY>我是谁不重要
<19-9,KENNY>It's not important who I am.

562
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:17,190
<19-9,KENNY>你赢了  符号应被揭晓
<19-9,KENNY>The win is yours. The sign shall be revealed.

563
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,720
<19-10,CASTLE>那是苏珊娜白板上的符号
<19-10,CASTLE>That's the symbol from Susannah's board.

564
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:28,940
<19-10,CASTLE>她来过这里  是你
<19-10,CASTLE>She was here. It was you.

565
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:30,300
<19-10,CASTLE>是你杀了她
<19-10,CASTLE>You're the one who killed her.

566
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,340
<19-11,KENNY>等等  你赢了  哥们儿
<19-11,KENNY>Whoa, wait a minute. You won, man.

567
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,760
<19-11,KENNY>你现在可以把剑放下了
<19-11,KENNY>You can put the sword down now.

568
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,480
<19-12,CASTLE>除非你告诉我你是谁
<19-12,CASTLE>Not until you tell me who you are

569
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:37,960
<19-12,CASTLE>还有你为什么要杀死苏珊娜·里奇兰德  贝克特
<19-12,CASTLE>and why you killed Susannah Richland. Beckett!

570
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,630
<19-13,KENNY>我觉得你好像搞错了
<19-13,KENNY>I think there's been some kind of mistake here.

571
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:41,010
<19-14,CASTLE>不不不  没搞错
<19-14,CASTLE>No, no, no, no mistake.

572
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,650
<19-14,CASTLE>苏珊娜被你或你们这伙人中的一个
<19-14,CASTLE>Susannah was stabbed through the throat

573
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:45,910
<19-14,CASTLE>用一柄双刃佩剑刺穿喉咙
<19-14,CASTLE>with a double-edged saber by you or one of your people.

574
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:46,950
<19-15,KENNY>对不起  我有点迷糊了
<19-15,KENNY>I'm sorry. I'm a little lost here.

575
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,420
<19-15,KENNY>他们改剧本了吗
<19-15,KENNY>Did they change the script?

576
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:50,250
<19-15,KENNY>因为如果他们改了  他们可没告诉我
<19-15,KENNY>'cause if they did, they didn't tell me.

577
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:51,490
<19-16,CASTLE>剧本
<19-16,CASTLE>Script?

578
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:54,940
<19-16,CASTLE>什么剧本
<19-16,CASTLE>What script?

579
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,350
<19-17,KENNY>寻宝游戏
<19-17,KENNY>The scavenger hunt.

580
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:02,070
<19-17,KENNY>卡塞尔
<19-17,KENNY>Castle?

581
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:03,930
<19-18,BECKETT>怎么回事
<19-18,BECKETT>What's going on?

582
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,070
<19-18,BECKETT>寻宝游戏
<19-18,BECKETT>A scavenger hunt?

583
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:12,070
<20-1,CASTLE>这些线索  符号  都是个游戏吗
<20-1,CASTLE>So the clues, the symbol-- it's all just a game?

584
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:15,490
<20-2,KENNY>是为纽约历史研究院举办的募捐
<20-2,KENNY>It's a fund-raiser for the New York Historical Institute.

585
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:17,350
<20-2,KENNY>线索指引到历史建筑
<20-2,KENNY>The clues lead to historic buildings,

586
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:19,810
<20-2,KENNY>参加游戏的人在里面收集这些古老符号
<20-2,KENNY>where the players collect these old symbols.

587
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:23,100
<20-2,KENNY>他们雇佣像我这样的演员与参赛者互动
<20-2,KENNY>They hire actors like me to interact with the contestants.

588
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:25,040
<20-2,KENNY>我通常在文艺复兴集市上演出
<20-2,KENNY>I usually work Renaissance Fairs.

589
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,250
<20-3,BECKETT>这个女人是你们的参赛者之一吗
<20-3,BECKETT>Was this woman one of your contestants?

590
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:31,710
<20-4,KENNY>是  她几天前就过了这一关
<20-4,KENNY>Yeah. She came through here couple days ago.

591
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:33,260
<20-4,KENNY>她被杀害了吗
<20-4,KENNY>She was killed?

592
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,020
<20-5,CASTLE>是  被一柄佩剑
<20-5,CASTLE>Yeah, with a saber

593
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,770
<20-5,CASTLE>跟你用的这把几乎一模一样
<20-5,CASTLE>almost exactly like the one you were using.

594
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:38,610
<20-6,KENNY>那是特技武器  不会伤人  这些都是
<20-6,KENNY>That was a stunt weapon. It's harmless. They all are.

595
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:41,280
<20-6,KENNY>我没杀人  我只是个演员
<20-6,KENNY>I didn't kill anybody. I'm just an actor.

596
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,250
<20-6,KENNY>我昨晚都没在这里工作
<20-6,KENNY>I wasn't even working here last night.

597
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:46,240
<20-6,KENNY>拜托  打电话给纽约历史研究所
<20-6,KENNY>Look, please, call the New York Historical Institute.

598
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,200
<20-6,KENNY>找他们的主管诺兰·伯恩斯
<20-6,KENNY>Talk to Nolan Burns, their director.

599
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,490
<20-6,KENNY>这全都是游戏而已
<20-6,KENNY>This is all just a game.

600
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:51,770
<21-1,NOLAN BURNS>这当然只是个游戏
<21-1,NOLAN BURNS>Of course it was just a game.

601
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:55,540
<21-1,NOLAN BURNS>每年越来越多的纽约历史建筑
<21-1,NOLAN BURNS>Every year, more and more historic New York buildings

602
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:56,800
<21-1,NOLAN BURNS>被拆毁
<21-1,NOLAN BURNS>are being torn down,

603
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,660
<21-1,NOLAN BURNS>作为历史研究所的主管
<21-1,NOLAN BURNS>and as director of the Historical Institute,

604
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:01,010
<21-1,NOLAN BURNS>我在寻找有趣的方式来提高关注度
<21-1,NOLAN BURNS>I was looking for a fun way to raise awareness.

605
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:02,890
<21-2,BECKETT>伯恩斯先生  这些
<21-2,BECKETT>Mr. Burns, these symbols

606
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:04,940
<21-2,BECKETT>苏珊娜·里奇兰德拍下照片的符号
<21-2,BECKETT>that Susannah Richland took pictures of--

607
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,680
<21-2,BECKETT>也是游戏的一部分吗
<21-2,BECKETT>are those also a part of the game?

608
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:10,310
<21-3,BURNS>是的  这些都是用在游戏中的符号
<21-3,BURNS>Yes, these are all... symbols used in the game.

609
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:12,180
<21-3,BURNS>看来她找到了全部
<21-3,BURNS>Looks like she found them all.

610
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:14,210
<21-3,BURNS>她本有可能胜出的
<21-3,BURNS>She might have won.

611
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:16,170
<21-4,BECKETT>有没有可能是有人为了赢得比赛
<21-4,BECKETT>Is it possible that someone would have killed her

612
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:17,690
<21-4,BECKETT>而杀了她
<21-4,BECKETT>to get a competitive edge?

613
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:19,790
<21-5,BURNS>奖金是2500美元
<21-5,BURNS>Prize money is $2,500.

614
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:23,070
<21-5,BURNS>一些参赛者的路费都比这多
<21-5,BURNS>Some of the contestants spent more than that in travel expenses.

615
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,450
<21-6,CASTLE>这些符号可能有别的意思吗
<21-6,CASTLE>Could these symbols mean something else?

616
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:26,920
<21-6,CASTLE>带有危险性的意思
<21-6,CASTLE>Something dangerous?

617
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:28,130
<21-7,BURNS>据我所知没有
<21-7,BURNS>Not that I'm aware of.

618
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,320
<21-7,BURNS>我知道在一些18世纪建造的房子上
<21-7,BURNS>I do know they can be found on buildings

619
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,290
<21-7,BURNS>能找到这些符号
<21-7,BURNS>dating as far back as the 1700s,

620
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:33,940
<21-7,BURNS>所以我才使用了它们
<21-7,BURNS>which is why I used them.

621
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:34,680
<21-7,BURNS>但是
<21-7,BURNS>It's just...

622
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,830
<21-8,CASTLE>被害人身上带着一封信
<21-8,CASTLE>Our victim had this letter on her.

623
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,390
<21-8,CASTLE>出自18世纪共济会成员西奥多·罗斯之手
<21-8,CASTLE>It's from an 18th-century freemason named Theodore Rose.

624
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:43,550
<21-8,CASTLE>他在信中提到一个巨大的隐秘
<21-8,CASTLE>In it, he speaks of a great hidden secret.

625
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:45,550
<21-9,BURNS>"藏在这座城市之中"
<21-9,BURNS>It'd be "Enshrined in the city."

626
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,140
<21-9,BURNS>这封信是游戏的一部分
<21-9,BURNS>The letter was part of the game.

627
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:49,270
<21-9,BURNS>我们把它手写在羊皮纸上
<21-9,BURNS>We had it hand-written on parchment.

628
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:50,780
<21-9,BURNS>参赛者人手一份
<21-9,BURNS>One for each contestant.

629
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,090
<21-10,CASTLE>但罗斯确有其人
<21-10,CASTLE>But Rose is real.

630
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:54,580
<21-10,CASTLE>他热衷于留下线索和密码
<21-10,CASTLE>He had a penchant for clues and ciphers.

631
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:57,570
<21-11,BURNS>正是如此  他增加了游戏的真实性
<21-11,BURNS>Exactly. He brought some authenticity.

632
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:59,780
<21-11,BURNS>他是一名共济会成员
<21-11,BURNS>And the fact that he was a freemason

633
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,520
<21-11,BURNS>又是乔治·华盛顿之友的事实
<21-11,BURNS>and a friend of George Washington's

634
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,980
<21-11,BURNS>让他成为本游戏核心人物的最佳人选
<21-11,BURNS>made rose the perfect person on whom to base the game.

635
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,740
<21-11,BURNS>所以我从他的手稿提取部分内容
<21-11,BURNS>So I drew from his writings,

636
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:09,360
<21-11,BURNS>剩下的则从共济会历史中摘取
<21-11,BURNS>and the rest I pulled from freemason history.

637
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,730
<21-11,BURNS>但这都是虚构的
<21-11,BURNS>But none of this is real.

638
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,550
<21-11,BURNS>我从未想到这会导致某人的死亡
<21-11,BURNS>I don't see how any of this would lead to someone's death.

639
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:17,090
<21-12,BECKETT>不管怎样  我需要所有参赛者的姓名
<21-12,BECKETT>Regardless, I'm gonna need the names of all of the contestants.

640
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,170
<21-13,BURNS>那你得联系这次活动的策划公司
<21-13,BURNS>You'll have to check with the event planning company,

641
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:21,690
<21-13,BURNS>"极限游戏"  他们负责活动报名
<21-13,BURNS>Games Ultra. They handled the registration.

642
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:26,240
<22-1,CASTLE>无法相信费这么大劲最后竟都是虚构的
<22-1,CASTLE>Can't believe all this time, it was all just make-believe.

643
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,240
<22-2,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你不是真的相信
<22-2,BECKETT>Castle, you didn't really believe

644
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,970
<22-2,BECKETT>这背后隐藏着一个
<22-2,BECKETT>that this was gonna lead to some

645
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:31,740
<22-2,BECKETT>共济会宝藏  是吧
<22-2,BECKETT>great freemason treasure, did you?

646
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:34,160
<22-3,CASTLE>不  当然不相信  那太傻了
<22-3,CASTLE>No, of course not. That'd be foolish.

647
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:36,440
<22-3,CASTLE>我先失陪了  我要回家
<22-3,CASTLE>Now if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go home

648
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,810
<22-3,CASTLE>沉溺于我破案生涯中
<22-3,CASTLE>to wallow in what is perhaps the most disappointing day

649
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:40,570
<22-3,CASTLE>最令人失望的一天中  暗自抹泪
<22-3,CASTLE>Of my crime-solving career.

650
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:43,330
<22-4,BECKETT>我过会回去  给你打打气
<22-4,BECKETT>Okay, I'll come by later and try to cheer you up.

651
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:50,310
<22-5,BECKETT>从"极限游戏"那拿到参赛者名单了么
<22-5,BECKETT>Did we get the list of contestants from Games Ultra?

652
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:51,830
<22-6,ESPOSITO>拿到了  而且参赛报名表
<22-6,ESPOSITO>Yep, and the contestant applications

653
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:53,960
<22-6,ESPOSITO>肯定会有照片  看看这位老兄
<22-6,ESPOSITO>had to include a photo. Take a look at this dude.

654
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,980
<22-7,BECKETT>他怎么了
<22-7,BECKETT>What about him?

655
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,830
<22-8,RYAN>与修道士提供的跟踪苏珊娜的
<22-8,RYAN>Well, check out the sketch that our monk gave us of the guy

656
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:59,910
<22-8,RYAN>家伙的素描对比下
<22-8,RYAN>that he says was following Susannah.

657
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,710
<22-9,BECKETT>是同一个人
<22-9,BECKETT>Well, it's the same guy.

658
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:06,470
<22-9,BECKETT>那关于这位汤姆·史蒂文斯
<22-9,BECKETT>Okay. So... what do we know

659
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:08,120
<22-9,BECKETT>我们知道些什么
<22-9,BECKETT>about Tom Stevens?

660
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,090
<22-10,RYAN>他的名字和地址都是伪造的
<22-10,RYAN>Well, his name and address are bogus.

661
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,410
<22-10,RYAN>报名表上的其他信息也一样
<22-10,RYAN>Everything on the application is.

662
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:12,880
<22-10,RYAN>没一条是真的
<22-10,RYAN>None of this information is real.

663
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,040
<22-11,ESPOSITO>他肯定就是凶手
<22-11,ESPOSITO>And he had to be the guy who killed her.

664
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:15,010
<22-11,ESPOSITO>他到过修道院
<22-11,ESPOSITO>He was at the monastery.

665
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:16,880
<22-11,ESPOSITO>不然怎么会用假名注册
<22-11,ESPOSITO>Why else would he sign up with a fake name?

666
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:20,040
<22-12,BECKETT>他的名字是假的  但他的钱是真的
<22-12,BECKETT>Well, his name might be fake, but his money is real.

667
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:22,440
<22-12,BECKETT>找到了  支票付款
<22-12,BECKETT>And there you go. Paid with a check.

668
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,900
<22-12,BECKETT>如果我们能查到这次付款
<22-12,BECKETT>If we can trace that payment...

669
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:25,220
<22-13,ESPOSITO>那我们就能知道他是谁
<22-13,ESPOSITO>Then we might be able to I.D. him.

670
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,950
<22-14,BECKETT>看看"极限游戏"在哪家银行开户
<22-14,BECKETT>All right, see where Games Ultra keeps their accounts

671
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,320
<22-14,BECKETT>明早立刻联系那家银行
<22-14,BECKETT>and hit that bank first thing in the morning.

672
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,610
<22-14,BECKETT>我要找到这家伙
<22-14,BECKETT>I want this guy found.

<23-3,MARTHA>What is all this?

677
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:41,990
<23-4,CASTLE>只是些  游戏
<23-4,CASTLE>Oh, just some... game.

678
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,770
<23-4,CASTLE>你最好抽点时间
<23-4,CASTLE>Well, you might wanna

679
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:45,360
<23-5,MARTHA>关注下现实世界
<23-5,MARTHA>pay attention to the real world for a moment.

680
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,260
<23-5,MARTHA>阿丽克西斯对你在那天晚上聚餐时的行为
<23-5,MARTHA>Alexis is furious with you over your behavior

681
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:51,120
<23-5,MARTHA>极为恼火  我必须说  我赞成她
<23-5,MARTHA>at dinner the other night, and I must say, I agree.

<23-6,CASTLE>得了  我没那么糟糕
<23-6,CASTLE>Come on. It wasn't that bad.

683
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:54,340
<23-7,MARTHA>你羞辱了她的公寓
<23-7,MARTHA>You insulted her apartment.

684
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:56,350
<23-7,MARTHA>你拿她男友的工作开玩笑
<23-7,MARTHA>You made fun of her boyfriend's career.

00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:57,770
<23-8,CASTLE>老妈  他在数蜜蜂
<23-8,CASTLE>Mother, he's counting bees.

686
00:26:57,770 --> 00:27:00,020
<23-9,MARTHA>是的  而且那对他很重要
<23-9,MARTHA>Yes, and it is important to him,

687
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:02,070
<23-9,MARTHA>正如阿丽克西斯对他很重要
<23-9,MARTHA>As Alexis is important to him.

688
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:04,920
<23-10,CASTLE>我就是不明白  她怎么会和他在一起
<23-10,CASTLE>I just don't even understand. Why is she even with him?

689
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,890
<23-11,MARTHA>这是她想要的
<23-11,MARTHA>This is what she wants.

690
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:08,940
<23-11,MARTHA>她下个周下个月想要什么
<23-11,MARTHA>Now will she want it next week or next month?

691
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:09,870
<23-11,MARTHA>谁知道
<23-11,MARTHA>Who knows?

692
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:11,640
<23-11,MARTHA>但这是她此时此刻想要的
<23-11,MARTHA>But this is what she wants today.

693
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:15,230
<23-11,MARTHA>如果你想要她融入你的生活
<23-11,MARTHA>And if you want her to be a part of your life,

694
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:18,450
<23-11,MARTHA>那你必须改变看问题的角度
<23-11,MARTHA>then you are going to have to change your point of view.

695
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,630
<23-12,CASTLE>你是对的  老妈
<23-12,CASTLE>You're right, mother.

696
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:23,640
<23-13,MARTHA>我当然是对的  好极了
<23-13,MARTHA>Of course I'm right. Good.

697
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:31,930
<23-14,CASTLE>看问题的角度
<23-14,CASTLE>Point of view...

699
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:44,220
<23-15,CASTLE>这不是场游戏
<23-15,CASTLE>This isn't a game.

700
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,300
<23-15,CASTLE>完全不是
<23-15,CASTLE>This isn't a game at all.

701
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:54,330
<24-1,ESPOSITO>没找到
<24-1,ESPOSITO>No luck.

702
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:55,220
<24-1,ESPOSITO>根据银行记录
<24-1,ESPOSITO>According to the bank,

703
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:56,720
<24-1,ESPOSITO>史蒂文斯先生确实用支票付的款
<24-1,ESPOSITO>Mr. Stevens did pay with a check,

704
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,240
<24-1,ESPOSITO>但那是张银行本票  无法追踪
<24-1,ESPOSITO>but it was a cashier's check, so there's no way to trace it.

705
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:00,550
<24-2,BECKETT>隐瞒身份
<24-2,BECKETT>Hiding his identity,

706
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:03,200
<24-2,BECKETT>在被害人死前跟踪她
<24-2,BECKETT>following our victim just before she died.

707
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,870
<24-2,BECKETT>他肯定就是凶手
<24-2,BECKETT>This has gotta be our killer.

708
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:08,770
<24-3,RYAN>我终于追踪到了被害人上的
<24-3,RYAN>Okay. I finally tracked down that cab

709
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:09,830
<24-3,RYAN>那辆出租
<24-3,RYAN>that our victim got into--

710
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:12,100
<24-3,RYAN>车顶有《女巫前传》广告的那辆
<24-3,RYAN>The one with the "Wicked" banner ad on top.

711
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,440
<24-3,RYAN>开始  我打电话给
<24-3,RYAN>So first, I had to call

712
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,800
<24-3,RYAN>《女巫前传》上演的剧院
<24-3,RYAN>the theater Where "Wicked" Was playing.

713
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,050
<24-3,RYAN>他们把我指向公关公司
<24-3,RYAN>They directed me to a P.R. firm who then

714
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:19,090
<24-3,RYAN>然后又让我去找广告中介
<24-3,RYAN>sent me to an ad agency

715
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:21,580
<24-3,RYAN>他们代理出租车顶的广告  然后五辆车
<24-3,RYAN>that sells space on the top of cabs, and five cabs--

716
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:23,950
<24-4,ESPOSITO>-你跟出租车司机谈了没  -嗯
<24-4,ESPOSITO>- Did you talk to the cabbie or not? - Yes.

717
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:27,690
<24-5,RYAN>问到了  出租车司机确认他载过苏珊娜
<24-5,RYAN>Yes, I did. The cabbie confirmed that he picked up Susannah

718
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:29,610
<24-5,RYAN>晚上10:10在华盛顿高地
<24-5,RYAN>in Washington heights at 10:10 P.M.

719
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:31,090
<24-6,BECKETT>看来修道士说的是实话
<24-6,BECKETT>So our monk was telling the truth.

720
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:32,430
<24-6,BECKETT>那出租车司机把她载到哪了
<24-6,BECKETT>Okay, where did the cabbie take her?

721
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:34,620
<24-7,RYAN>奇怪的是  他没载她去任何地方
<24-7,RYAN>That's the odd part. He didn't take her anywhere.

722
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:35,710
<24-8,BECKETT>-什么意思  -苏珊娜只是让他
<24-8,BECKETT>- What do you mean? - Susannah just had him

723
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:37,410
<24-9,RYAN>在附近绕了45分钟
<24-9,RYAN>drive around the neighborhood for 45 minutes

724
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:38,860
<24-9,RYAN>然后回到教堂把她放下车
<24-9,RYAN>and dropped her back off at the chapel.

725
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:39,690
<24-10,BECKETT>这说不通啊
<24-10,BECKETT>That doesn't make any sense.

726
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:41,440
<24-10,BECKETT>为什么她当晚又回去了
<24-10,BECKETT>Why would she go back there the same night?

727
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,850
<24-11,CASTLE>我来告诉你为什么
<24-11,CASTLE>I'll tell you why.

728
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:47,190
<24-11,CASTLE>因为苏珊娜发现这不只是个游戏
<24-11,CASTLE>Because Susannah realized it wasn't just a game.

729
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:48,850
<24-12,BECKETT>卡塞尔  别告诉我你还在...
<24-12,BECKETT>Castle, please don't tell me that you're still on--

730
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:49,980
<24-12,BECKETT>不不  听我说
<24-12,BECKETT>Oh, no, no. Just listen.

731
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,640
<24-13,CASTLE>伯恩斯告诉我们  他把游戏设定在
<24-13,CASTLE>Burns told us that he based the game

732
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,590
<24-13,CASTLE>西奥多·罗斯的一些作品之上
<24-13,CASTLE>on some of the writings of Theodore Rose.

733
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:54,930
<24-13,CASTLE>如果罗斯给的提示都是真的呢
<24-13,CASTLE>Now what if Rose's clues were real

734
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:56,740
<24-13,CASTLE>真的能指向某个地方
<24-13,CASTLE>and actually led somewhere?

735
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:59,710
<24-13,CASTLE>如果苏珊娜发现了这一点呢
<24-13,CASTLE>What if Susannah figured that out?

736
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:02,460
<24-13,CASTLE>这是所有的符号
<24-13,CASTLE>Here are all our symbols.

737
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,330
<24-13,CASTLE>互相之间看似没有关联
<24-13,CASTLE>They didn't seem to relate to each other

738
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:07,810
<24-13,CASTLE>直到加上这一块  苏珊娜画在她手上的这块
<24-13,CASTLE>until you add this one--the one Susannah drew on her hand.

739
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:11,620
<24-13,CASTLE>她当晚在教堂发现这符号后就被杀了
<24-13,CASTLE>The one she found at the chapel the night she was killed.

740
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:13,780
<24-14,BECKETT>它们可以拼合起来
<24-14,BECKETT>They all fit together.

741
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:16,560
<24-15,CASTLE>最后一块  没有它  其他的都拼不起来
<24-15,CASTLE>Final piece. Without it, the others didn't fit.

742
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,720
<24-15,CASTLE>所以凶手把她手上符号的抹掉了
<24-15,CASTLE>That's why the killer scraped it off her hand.

743
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:20,070
<24-15,CASTLE>他不希望她或者其他人
<24-15,CASTLE>He didn't want her or anyone else

744
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,910
<24-15,CASTLE>发现这个秘密
<24-15,CASTLE>to be able to figure it out.

745
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:23,630
<24-16,ESPOSITO>那么碎片拼起来之后
<24-16,ESPOSITO>Okay, so the pieces fit together.

746
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:24,840
<24-16,ESPOSITO>能说明什么呢
<24-16,ESPOSITO>What do they mean?

747
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:27,960
<24-17,CASTLE>我不知道  但是...
<24-17,CASTLE>I don't know, but...

748
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:30,830
<24-17,CASTLE>这个形状看着眼熟吗
<24-17,CASTLE>Does this shape look familiar?

749
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,840
<24-18,BECKETT>眼熟
<24-18,BECKETT>Yes, it does.

750
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,980
<25-1,CASTLE>-好神奇  -是啊
<25-1,CASTLE>- Amazing, right? - Yeah.

751
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,110
<25-2,BECKETT>但这能说明什么呢
<25-2,BECKETT>But what does it mean?

752
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:43,700
<25-3,CASTLE>说明这不是游戏的一部分
<25-3,CASTLE>It means that this isn't a part of any game.

753
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:48,400
<25-3,CASTLE>如果所有符号拼合之后指向这个浮雕
<25-3,CASTLE>If all those symbols put together indicate this carving,

754
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,520
<25-3,CASTLE>那它一定内含玄机
<25-3,CASTLE>then it has to have some kind of significance.

755
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,960
<25-3,CASTLE>卡塞尔  看这个
<25-3,CASTLE>Castle, look at this.

756
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:57,800
<25-4,BECKETT>每个符号旁边都有一个小字母
<25-4,BECKETT>Each one of these symbols has a small letter next to it--

757
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,450
<25-4,BECKETT>R-O-S-I
<25-4,BECKETT>R-O-S-I.

758
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:03,720
<25-5,CASTLE>罗西  可能是指他的名字罗斯
<25-5,CASTLE>Rosi? Maybe it's supposed to be his name--Rose.

759
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,990
<25-6,BECKETT>这是"I"
<25-6,BECKETT>Uh, that's a-- that's an "I".

760
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:08,320
<25-6,BECKETT>可能是"Rois"  法语中的"国王"
<25-6,BECKETT>Um... maybe it's "Rois", Like, uh, french for "King,"

761
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,460
<25-6,BECKETT>"Soir"  法语中的"夜晚"
<25-6,BECKETT>Or, uh, "Soir" For "Evening".

762
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:12,210
<25-7,CASTLE>不  等等
<25-7,CASTLE>Oh, no, wait.

763
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:15,600
<25-7,CASTLE>土  气  水  火  以太在中央
<25-7,CASTLE>Earth, air, water, fire, ether in the center.

764
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,790
<25-7,CASTLE>在中世纪炼金术中代表五大元素
<25-7,CASTLE>In medieval alchemy, these are the five elements

765
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,970
<25-7,CASTLE>它们组成了宇宙
<25-7,CASTLE>that make up the universe,

766
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:20,700
<25-7,CASTLE>但它们的重要性有先后之分
<25-7,CASTLE>But there's an order of importance--

767
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:22,520
<25-7,CASTLE>土  气  水  火
<25-7,CASTLE>Earth, air, water, fire.

768
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,750
<25-7,CASTLE>把字母按照这个顺序排列
<25-7,CASTLE>We put the letters in that order,

769
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:25,940
<25-7,CASTLE>那就是O-R-I
<25-7,CASTLE>It's O-R-I...

770
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:28,450
<25-7,CASTLE>S
<25-7,CASTLE>S.

771
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:31,860
<25-7,CASTLE>"Oris"
<25-7,CASTLE>"Oris".

772
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:34,410
<25-7,CASTLE>拉丁语中的"口"
<25-7,CASTLE>Latin for "Mouth."

773
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,340
<25-8,CASTLE>-我开玩笑呢  -卡塞尔
<25-8,CASTLE>- I'm just kidding. - Castle!

774
00:30:57,490 --> 00:30:58,960
<25-10,CASTLE>没想到你会上当
<25-10,CASTLE>I can't believe you fell for that.

775
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:02,640
<25-11,CASTLE>不过里面真的有东西  等等
<25-11,CASTLE>There is something in here, though. Hang on.

776
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:47,500
<25-12,BECKETT>苏珊娜来过这里
<25-12,BECKETT>Susannah was here.

777
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:49,950
<25-12,BECKETT>这里是犯罪现场
<25-12,BECKETT>This is our crime scene.

778
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,540
<25-13,CASTLE>这是凶器
<25-13,CASTLE>There's our murder weapon.

779
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:54,990
<25-14,BECKETT>卡塞尔  看这里  这些痕迹是新的
<25-14,BECKETT>Castle, look at this. These marks are fresh.

780
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:56,960
<25-14,BECKETT>有人想把它打开
<25-14,BECKETT>Someone was trying to get inside it.

781
00:31:57,990 --> 00:31:59,740
<25-15,CASTLE>苏珊娜当晚肯定来过
<25-15,CASTLE>Susannah must have come to the chapel that night

782
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:01,590
<25-15,CASTLE>和我们一样发现了进来的方法
<25-15,CASTLE>and figured out how to get in here just like we did.

783
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:02,600
<25-16,BECKETT>不过在打开石棺前
<25-16,BECKETT>Except the killer found her

784
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:04,810
<25-16,BECKETT>凶手找到了她
<25-16,BECKETT>before she was able to open the sarcophagus.

785
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:06,120
<25-17,CASTLE>你觉得里面是什么
<25-17,CASTLE>What do you think's inside?

786
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:06,960
<25-17,CASTLE>不知道
<25-17,CASTLE>I don't know,

787
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:08,600
<25-18,BECKETT>有人觉得里面放着值得去杀人的东西
<25-18,BECKETT>but someone thought it was worth killing for.

788
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:15,770
<25-19,CASTLE>好吧
<25-19,CASTLE>Okay.

789
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,600
<25-19,CASTLE>推...推不动
<25-19,CASTLE>Okay, okay.

790
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,350
<25-20,CASTLE>如果跟我们先前推理的一样
<25-20,CASTLE>Okay. If it's like everything else we've been doing,

791
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:26,490
<25-20,CASTLE>解开线索才能打开它
<25-20,CASTLE>we need to solve a clue to open it.

792
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:28,440
<25-21,BECKETT>卡塞尔  看这个地球
<25-21,BECKETT>Hey, Castle, look at the world.

793
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:31,030
<25-21,BECKETT>跟圣坛上的彩色玻璃那个看上去一样
<25-21,BECKETT>It's just like the one in the stained glass above the altar.

794
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,960
<25-22,CASTLE>"世界在天堂与埃土间翻转"
<25-22,CASTLE>"The world spins between the heavens and the ash heap."

795
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:37,920
<25-22,CASTLE>尘归尘  石棺也许就代表埃土
<25-22,CASTLE>Ashes to ashes. The coffin could be the ash heap.

796
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,710
<25-23,BECKETT>这就表示  那么
<25-23,BECKETT>Which means, then, that...

797
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:42,300
<25-23,BECKETT>那儿  那里是天堂
<25-23,BECKETT>There. Those are heavens.

798
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:52,170
<25-24,CASTLE>"地球翻转"
<25-24,CASTLE>"The world turns..."

799
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:13,030
<25-25,CASTLE>"1792年"
<25-25,CASTLE>"1792".

800
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:16,410
<25-25,CASTLE>这是拜福德教授跟我们说过的
<25-25,CASTLE>These are the half dimes Professor Byford

801
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:17,670
<25-25,CASTLE>五美分银币
<25-25,CASTLE>just told us about.

802
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:18,760
<25-25,CASTLE>这些是美国财政部铸造的
<25-25,CASTLE>These are the very first coins

803
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,670
<25-25,CASTLE>第一批硬币
<25-25,CASTLE>to be minted by the U.S. Treasury.

804
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:21,820
<25-25,CASTLE>可值钱了
<25-25,CASTLE>These are worth a fortune.

805
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:23,200
<25-26,BECKETT>杀人动机也有了
<25-26,BECKETT>Now we have our motive for murder.

806
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,080
<25-27,CASTLE>去年拍卖会上  一枚就值
<25-27,CASTLE>Just one of these went for auction last year.

807
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,820
<25-27,CASTLE>150万美元
<25-27,CASTLE>$1.5 million.

808
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:30,380
<25-27,CASTLE>这里应该有一千枚
<25-27,CASTLE>There's gotta be a thousand of them in here.

809
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:31,820
<25-27,CASTLE>你知道这得值多少钱吗
<25-27,CASTLE>Do you have any idea what that's worth?

810
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:34,520
<25-27,CASTLE>我已经告诉你了
<25-27,CASTLE>I just told you what it's worth.

811
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,430
<25-28,BECKETT>怎么回事
<25-28,BECKETT>What was that?

812
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:41,630
<25-29,CASTLE>要我猜  肯定不是好事
<25-29,CASTLE>If I had to guess, I would say something bad.

813
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,890
<25-30,BECKETT>不  不
<25-30,BECKETT>No, no.

814
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,910
<26-1,BECKETT>卡塞尔  把那袋硬币放回棺材里
<26-1,BECKETT>Castle, put the bag of coins back in the coffin.

815
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:01,110
<26-1,BECKETT>也许门会再打开
<26-1,BECKETT>Maybe it'll open up the door again.

816
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:02,040
<26-2,CASTLE>好主意
<26-2,CASTLE>Good idea.

817
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,590
<26-3,CASTLE>该死
<26-3,CASTLE>Rats.

818
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:13,030
<26-3,CASTLE>在我的想象中  带你来教堂可不是这个样子
<26-3,CASTLE>This is not my idea of going to the chapel with you.

819
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:14,580
<26-3,CASTLE>你手机有信号吗
<26-3,CASTLE>Do you have a cell signal?

820
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,180
<26-4,BECKETT>没有
<26-4,BECKETT>Yeah, it doesn't look like it.

821
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:18,210
<26-5,CASTLE>看来那封信上说的没错
<26-5,CASTLE>Well, then the letter was right.

822
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:20,170
<26-5,CASTLE>"若心生歹意
<26-5,CASTLE>"Peril and woe to him who follows this path

823
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:22,710
<26-5,CASTLE>必将遭遇不幸"  咱们死定了
<26-5,CASTLE>with a dark heart." This is it.

824
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,730
<26-6,BECKETT>卡塞尔  咱们不会死在这的
<26-6,BECKETT>Castle, we're not gonna die in here.

825
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:26,440
<26-7,CASTLE>你也看到那些墙有多厚了
<26-7,CASTLE>You saw how thick those walls were.

826
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,600
<26-7,CASTLE>那都是石头墙  我们就算是大喊大叫一整天
<26-7,CASTLE>They're made of stone. We can yell and scream

827
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,710
<26-7,CASTLE>也不会有人听得见的
<26-7,CASTLE>all day long. No one's gonna hear.

828
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:32,960
<26-7,CASTLE>这屋里又不可能有吃的
<26-7,CASTLE>It's not like they stocked up this place with supplies.

829
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,970
<26-7,CASTLE>等咱俩吃蜡烛吃够了以后怎么办
<26-7,CASTLE>And what's gonna happen when we get tired of eating candle wax?

830
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:37,400
<26-8,BECKETT>不会的  我们会从这里出去的
<26-8,BECKETT>No, we're gonna get out of here.

831
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:39,300
<26-8,BECKETT>肯定有办法出去的
<26-8,BECKETT>There has to be a way out.

832
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,020
<26-9,CASTLE>好吧  也许你是对的
<26-9,CASTLE>Okay, yeah, you know what? You're right.

833
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:44,840
<26-9,CASTLE>这只是西奥多·罗斯对我们的考验
<26-9,CASTLE>All right, this is just Theodore Rose testing us.

834
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:47,470
<26-9,CASTLE>肯定还会有其它线索  其它的谜题
<26-9,CASTLE>There's gotta be another clue, another puzzle.

835
00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:49,330
<26-9,CASTLE>有可能是跟他的名字有关  会不会
<26-9,CASTLE>Something to do with his name. What if...

836
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:51,970
<26-9,CASTLE>会不会是变位词呢
<26-9,CASTLE>what if it's an anagram?

837
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:55,130
<26-10,CASTLE>西奥多·罗斯还可以拼成
<26-10,CASTLE>Theodore Rose...is...

838
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,130
<26-10,CASTLE>留意或是脚趾
<26-10,CASTLE>heed or toes.

839
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:01,670
<26-10,CASTLE>不对  西奥多·罗斯还可以是
<26-10,CASTLE>No. Theodore Rose...

840
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:04,230
<26-10,CASTLE>他  干公鸡
<26-10,CASTLE>he...do rooster.

841
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:06,340
<26-10,CASTLE>这太不合适了  好吧
<26-10,CASTLE>That's inappropriate. Okay.

842
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:07,390
<26-10,CASTLE>西奥多·罗斯  西奥多·罗斯
<26-10,CASTLE>Theodore Rose, Theodore Rose.

843
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,020
<26-10,CASTLE>鹿吃奥利奥
<26-10,CASTLE>Deer shot Oreo.

844
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:11,630
<26-10,CASTLE>十八世纪还没有奥利奥呢
<26-10,CASTLE>Oh, they didn't have Oreos in the 1700s.

845
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:15,070
<26-11,BECKETT>-卡塞尔  可能有别的办法出去  -我洗耳恭听
<26-11,BECKETT>- Castle, there might be another way out of here. - I'm all ears.

846
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:17,760
<26-12,CASTLE>杀害苏珊娜的凶手知道
<26-12,CASTLE>Susannah's killer knows that the half dimes

847
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,090
<26-13,BECKETT>这些五美分硬币还在这
<26-13,BECKETT>are still in here.

848
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:21,960
<26-13,BECKETT>他早晚得回到这里来
<26-13,BECKETT>Eventually, he's gonna have to come back...

849
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:23,430
<26-13,BECKETT>取走这些硬币
<26-13,BECKETT>to get them.

850
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:26,230
<26-14,CASTLE>他肯定是一个一开始就知道硬币存在的人
<26-14,CASTLE>He must be somebody who knew they existed in the first place.

851
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,290
<26-15,BECKETT>一个一开始就知道这一切都是
<26-15,BECKETT>Someone...who knew...all of this...

852
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,740
<26-15,BECKETT>真实的人
<26-15,BECKETT>was real.

853
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:36,000
<26-16,CASTLE>还有谁比那个让大家都以为这只是个游戏的人
<26-16,CASTLE>And who better than the person who wanted everyone to think

854
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,500
<26-16,CASTLE>更可疑的呢
<26-16,CASTLE>that this was just a game?

855
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:39,570
<26-17,BECKETT>诺兰·伯恩斯
<26-17,BECKETT>Nolan Burns.

856
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:41,390
<26-17,BECKETT>历史研究院的主管
<26-17,BECKETT>The director of the historical institute.

857
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:44,710
<26-17,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我手机有信号了
<26-17,BECKETT>Castle, I've got bars.

858
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:45,650
<26-18,CASTLE>终于啊
<26-18,CASTLE>Finally.

859
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,620
<26-19,ESPOSITO>怎么了  贝克特
<26-19,ESPOSITO>What's up, Beckett?

860
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:49,690
<26-20,BECKETT>埃斯波  你得马上来教堂一下
<26-20,BECKETT>Espo, you need to get to the chapel now.

861
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:51,950
<26-20,BECKETT>还有  让莱恩把诺兰·伯恩斯带回局里
<26-20,BECKETT>And tell Ryan to pick up Nolan Burns.

862
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:54,870
<27-1,BECKETT>伯恩斯先生
<27-1,BECKETT>Mr. Burns...

863
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:58,260
<27-1,BECKETT>上次见你的时候  你漏了一些细节没有告诉我们
<27-1,BECKETT>you left out a few details the last time we spoke.

864
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,100
<27-2,BURNS>我不明白你在说什么
<27-2,BURNS>I don't know what you mean.

865
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,610
<27-3,BURNS>你找到了
<27-3,BURNS>You found them.

866
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:12,250
<27-4,BECKETT>所以说这不仅仅是个游戏
<27-4,BECKETT>So it wasn't just a game.

867
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:17,520
<27-4,BECKETT>的确
<27-4,BECKETT>No.

868
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:20,990
<27-5,BURNS>我们发给选手们的信件
<27-5,BURNS>That...letter we gave the contestants

869
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,360
<27-5,BURNS>是以真实的信件为基础改写的
<27-5,BURNS>was based on an actual letter

870
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,890
<27-5,BURNS>而那封信是我在重新装修研究院时找到的
<27-5,BURNS>I found hidden in the building I was renovating.

871
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:27,310
<27-5,BURNS>我本来  是打算自己解开那些线索的
<27-5,BURNS>I tried to...follow the clues myself,

872
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,760
<27-5,BURNS>可是我有几个搞不懂的
<27-5,BURNS>but I couldn't solve them all.

873
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:32,330
<27-6,BECKETT>于是你就设计了这么一个寻宝游戏
<27-6,BECKETT>You set up a scavenger hunt to solve clues

874
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:34,090
<27-6,BECKETT>想通过众人的力量来解谜
<27-6,BECKETT>through crowdsourcing.

875
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:35,800
<27-7,BURNS>我从没想过会有人受伤
<27-7,BURNS>I never thought anyone would get hurt.

876
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,920
<27-8,BECKETT>不是受伤  伯恩斯  是被杀害
<27-8,BECKETT>Not hurt, Burns. Murdered.

877
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,020
<27-9,BURNS>但不是我干的  我发誓
<27-9,BURNS>But not by me, I swear.

878
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:42,740
<27-9,BURNS>我  我告诉过你  她去世的那天晚上
<27-9,BURNS>I-I told you, I-I was at home with my family

879
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:43,700
<27-9,BURNS>我在家里陪我的家人
<27-9,BURNS>the night she died.

880
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:46,630
<27-10,BECKETT>你还跟我说你不认识苏珊娜呢
<27-10,BECKETT>You also told me that you didn't know Susannah.

881
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:48,340
<27-10,BECKETT>我跟你的助手聊过了
<27-10,BECKETT>I spoke with your assistant.

882
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:50,300
<27-10,BECKETT>你在三个月前见过苏珊娜
<27-10,BECKETT>You met with her three months ago.

883
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,570
<27-10,BECKETT>这件事你怎么能不告诉我们呢
<27-10,BECKETT>How did you fail to mention that?

884
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:53,950
<27-11,BURNS>因为我知道你们会怎么想
<27-11,BURNS>'Cause I knew how it would look!

885
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:55,500
<27-12,BECKETT>现在情况对你更不利了
<27-12,BECKETT>And now it looks even worse.

886
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,340
<27-12,BECKETT>你为什么要见她
<27-12,BECKETT>Now why did you meet with her?

887
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:02,290
<27-13,BURNS>因为我希望她能在罗斯的家族史上
<27-13,BURNS>Because I hoped she would shed some light

888
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:04,060
<27-13,BURNS>给我点提示
<27-13,BURNS>on the Rose family history.

889
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:06,500
<27-13,BURNS>没准能找到一些可以帮助我解开最后一道谜题的东西
<27-13,BURNS>You know, something that might help solve that last clue,

890
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,450
<27-13,BURNS>仅此而已
<27-13,BURNS>but that was it!

891
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:08,690
<27-14,BECKETT>等一下  倒回去一下
<27-14,BECKETT>Wait a minute. Go back.

892
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:10,660
<27-14,BECKETT>苏珊娜只是个会计
<27-14,BECKETT>Susannah was an accountant.

893
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:14,110
<27-14,BECKETT>她怎么会了解罗斯家族呢
<27-14,BECKETT>Why would she know anything about the Rose family?

894
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,710
<27-15,BURNS>因为她是西奥多·罗斯的
<27-15,BURNS>Because she was a direct descendant

895
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:18,200
<27-15,BURNS>直系后代
<27-15,BURNS>of Theodore Rose.

896
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:20,620
<27-15,BURNS>失踪的五美分的传说
<27-15,BURNS>The legend of the missing half dimes

897
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:22,570
<27-16,BECKETT>是他们的家族传说
<27-16,BECKETT>was family lore.

898
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,770
<27-16,BECKETT>家族传说
<27-16,BECKETT>Family lore.

899
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,610
<28-1,HENRY>我听说你们在我表妹的谋杀案上
<28-1,HENRY>Hey. They said you found something out

900
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:35,900
<28-1,HENRY>有所进展
<28-1,HENRY>about my cousin's murder.

901
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:39,820
<28-2,BECKETT>是的  不过我们要先跟你核对一些事情
<28-2,BECKETT>Uh, we did. We, uh, we just need to go over a few things first.

902
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,470
<28-2,BECKETT>根据她的通话记录
<28-2,BECKETT>Now according to her phone records,

903
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:45,610
<28-2,BECKETT>她上几个月跟你联系的比以往频繁
<28-2,BECKETT>she called you more frequently over the last few months.

904
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:47,060
<28-2,BECKETT>有什么特别原因吗
<28-2,BECKETT>Is there any reason why?

905
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:48,870
<28-3,HENRY>我觉得她是一个人寂寞了
<28-3,HENRY>I got the feeling she was lonely.

906
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:52,610
<28-4,BECKETT>她有提到过西奥多·罗斯吗
<28-4,BECKETT>A-and did she ever mention Theodore Rose?

907
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:54,730
<28-5,HENRY>没有  她提这个干吗
<28-5,HENRY>No. Why would she?

908
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:57,770
<28-6,CASTLE>这么说你了解失踪的五美分的传说咯
<28-6,CASTLE>So you're familiar with the lore of the missing half dimes?

909
00:37:57,770 --> 00:37:59,970
<28-7,HENRY>当然  这是个家族之谜
<28-7,HENRY>Yeah, sure. It was a big family myth.

910
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:01,140
<28-8,CASTLE>只不过事实并非如此
<28-8,CASTLE>Except it wasn't.

911
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:04,200
<28-8,CASTLE>苏珊娜还真找到了那些硬币
<28-8,CASTLE>Susannah actually located the coins.

912
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:06,480
<28-8,CASTLE>它们被藏在教堂的密室里  她就是因此被杀的
<28-8,CASTLE>They were in a hidden crypt. That's where she was killed.

913
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,950
<28-9,HENRY>太可怕了
<28-9,HENRY>That's terrible.

914
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:10,010
<28-9,HENRY>知道是谁干的吗
<28-9,HENRY>Do you know who did it?

915
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:12,810
<28-10,BECKETT>最有可能的是知道她在寻宝的人
<28-10,BECKETT>Most likely someone who knew what she was looking for.

916
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:16,990
<28-10,BECKETT>鉴证组在密室里找到两组DNA
<28-10,BECKETT>CSU Found two sets of DNA in that crypt.

917
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:19,800
<28-10,BECKETT>一组是苏珊娜的  另一组是凶手的
<28-10,BECKETT>One was from Susannah. One was from her killer.

918
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,560
<28-10,BECKETT>我凭直觉找人对比了一下两组DNA
<28-10,BECKETT>Now on a hunch, I had them compare the two,

919
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:26,000
<28-10,BECKETT>结果显示  杀死苏珊娜的凶手
<28-10,BECKETT>and the results indicate that Susannah and her killer

920
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,590
<28-10,BECKETT>与她有血缘关系
<28-10,BECKETT>were related.

921
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:32,400
<28-11,CASTLE>鉴证组还发现了一根假发丝
<28-11,CASTLE>CSU also found a synthetic hair

922
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,030
<28-11,CASTLE>它属于类似这样的假发
<28-11,CASTLE>found in a wig not unlike this one.

923
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:39,110
<28-11,CASTLE>你使用假名  报名参加了寻宝游戏
<28-11,CASTLE>You signed up for the game under a false name.

924
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:41,970
<28-11,CASTLE>乔装打扮  来查探她的进度
<28-11,CASTLE>You used a disguise so you could track her progress.

925
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,340
<28-11,CASTLE>一切都结束了亨利  你就是凶手
<28-11,CASTLE>It's over, Henry. We know it's you.

926
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,940
<28-12,HENRY>我妈妈住在疗养院
<28-12,HENRY>My mom's in assisted living.

927
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:50,910
<28-12,HENRY>我努力工作  但还是过得非常拮据
<28-12,HENRY>I work hard, but I barely get by.

928
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,300
<28-12,HENRY>那些银币能改变我的人生
<28-12,HENRY>Those half dimes were gonna change my life.

929
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:56,200
<28-12,HENRY>但苏珊娜却说找到它们以后
<28-12,HENRY>But Susannah said that she was gonna find them

930
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,950
<28-12,HENRY>要把它们全捐出去
<28-12,HENRY>and then just give them all away.

931
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,730
<28-12,HENRY>她说那是历史的遗物
<28-12,HENRY>Said they were part of history,

932
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:03,150
<28-12,HENRY>属于人民
<28-12,HENRY>that they belonged to the people.

933
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,150
<28-12,HENRY>那晚  她打电话跟我说她找到了
<28-12,HENRY>She called me that night with the good news,

934
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:09,900
<28-12,HENRY>我再次试着阻止她把它们捐出去
<28-12,HENRY>and I tried to talk her out of it one last time.

935
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:12,010
<28-12,HENRY>我们发生争执
<28-12,HENRY>We argued.

936
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:16,210
<28-12,HENRY>之后就...
<28-12,HENRY>And the next thing I knew...

937
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,290
<29-1,RYAN>我查了之前的记录
<29-1,RYAN>Well, I was looking through the records,

938
00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:31,300
<29-1,RYAN>发现有好几代罗斯家的人
<29-1,RYAN>and I found out there have been

939
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:34,070
<29-1,RYAN>都是在那所教堂举行的婚礼
<29-1,RYAN>several Rose family weddings in that chapel.

940
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,570
<29-1,RYAN>苏珊娜几年前也曾去过那里
<29-1,RYAN>Susannah had even been there once years ago.

941
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:38,870
<29-1,RYAN>她一定还记得见过那扇琉璃彩窗
<29-1,RYAN>She must have remembered seeing that stained glass window.

942
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:40,770
<29-2,CASTLE>所以只有她能明白最后的线索
<29-2,CASTLE>That's how she was able to figure out that last clue

943
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:41,690
<29-2,CASTLE>所蕴含的意义
<29-2,CASTLE>when no one else could.

944
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:42,950
<29-3,RYAN>也是亨利把她手上的记号挖去的原因
<29-3,RYAN>And why Henry scraped it off her hand,

945
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:44,610
<29-3,RYAN>确保除了他没人能发现银币
<29-3,RYAN>so he could be only one that'd ever find it.

946
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:46,350
<29-4,BECKETT>那些银币怎么处理
<29-4,BECKETT>So what's gonna happen to the half dimes?

947
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:47,510
<29-5,ESPOSITO>银币是在教堂被发现的
<29-5,ESPOSITO>Well, they were found in the chapel,

948
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,940
<29-5,ESPOSITO>所以属于修道院
<29-5,ESPOSITO>so they belong to the monastery.

949
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:51,760
<29-6,CASTLE>和尚们的誓言遇到试炼了
<29-6,CASTLE>Well, that'll put the monks' vow of poverty to the test.

950
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,480
<29-7,ESPOSITO>他们已经已满分通过了"试炼"
<29-7,ESPOSITO>They've already passed that with flying colors.

951
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,670
<29-7,ESPOSITO>因为那些银币是重要的历史遗物
<29-7,ESPOSITO>Because of the historical significance of the coins,

952
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:57,050
<29-7,ESPOSITO>所以全都捐给大都会艺术博物馆
<29-7,ESPOSITO>they're donating them to The Met.

953
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,250
<29-8,CASTLE>你们知道吗
<29-8,CASTLE>You know...

954
00:39:59,250 --> 00:39:59,840
<29-9,RYAN>又来了  我先走了
<29-9,RYAN>Here we go. I gotta go.

955
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,590
<29-10,CASTLE>历史上传说  这些银币是乔治·华盛顿
<29-10,CASTLE>It is believed that George Washington

956
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:05,590
<29-10,CASTLE>将玛莎·华盛顿的银饰熔化后铸成的
<29-10,CASTLE>had those half dimes minted from Martha Washington's silver.

957
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,990
<29-10,CASTLE>那时候  在独立革命之前
<29-10,CASTLE>Back then, before the revolution,

958
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:09,480
<29-10,CASTLE>除了国王  其他人私自铸币是违法的
<29-10,CASTLE>it was illegal for anyone but a king to mint money.

959
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:12,770
<29-10,CASTLE>所以  这些银币的价值远超过它们本身
<29-10,CASTLE>So those coins are worth a lot more than just their silver.

960
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:15,870
<29-10,CASTLE>它们实际上是美国独立的宣言
<29-10,CASTLE>They're actually more of a declaration of independence.

961
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:16,640
<29-11,BECKETT>那就对了
<29-11,BECKETT>Well, then it's right

962
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,280
<29-11,BECKETT>像苏珊娜希望的那样回归人民
<29-11,BECKETT>That they're going back to the people,

963
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,410
<29-11,BECKETT>是物归原主了
<29-11,BECKETT>like Susannah wanted.

964
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:23,170
<29-12,CASTLE>说到"独立"  我得去找阿丽克西斯
<29-12,CASTLE>Speaking of independence, I gotta go see Alexis.

965
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:36,000
<30-1,CASTLE>能进来吗
<30-1,CASTLE>Can I come in?

966
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,870
<30-2,ALEXIS>就在这说吧
<30-2,ALEXIS>We can talk here.

967
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:44,140
<30-3,CASTLE>我对之前的行为感到非常抱歉
<30-3,CASTLE>Look, I'm... sorry about how I acted.

968
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,600
<30-4,ALEXIS>抱歉也不够
<30-4,ALEXIS>Being sorry isn't enough, dad.

969
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:50,330
<30-5,CASTLE>那我该怎么做
<30-5,CASTLE>Then what can I do?

970
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:52,020
<30-5,CASTLE>我要怎么做你才能原谅我
<30-5,CASTLE>What can I do to make this right?

971
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,820
<30-6,ALEXIS>你知道我是怎么得知你像贝克特求婚的事的吗
<30-6,ALEXIS>Do you know how I found out you had proposed to Beckett?

972
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:59,270
<30-6,ALEXIS>在哥斯达黎加  奶奶打电话告诉我的
<30-6,ALEXIS>Over the phone with gram while I was in Costa Rica.

973
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:01,310
<30-7,CASTLE>是因为贝克特的事吗
<30-7,CASTLE>This is about Beckett?

974
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:04,130
<30-8,ALEXIS>不  但你没告诉我  使我很难过
<30-8,ALEXIS>No, but I was hurt you didn't tell me.

975
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:05,390
<30-9,CASTLE>我是有打算要告诉你的
<30-9,CASTLE>Look, I was going to tell you.

976
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:06,460
<30-9,CASTLE>只是...
<30-9,CASTLE>It just...

977
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:08,350
<30-9,CASTLE>事情发生得太突然
<30-9,CASTLE>It just happened.

978
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:11,960
<30-10,ALEXIS>的确  而且我也不确定那是个好主意
<30-10,ALEXIS>I know it did, and I don't know if it's a good idea

979
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:14,400
<30-10,ALEXIS>不确定她就是你的真命天女
<30-10,ALEXIS>or if she's really the one,

980
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:17,880
<30-10,ALEXIS>但我还是接受了  不是吗
<30-10,ALEXIS>but you know what? I accept it.

981
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:19,810
<30-10,ALEXIS>你知道为什么吗
<30-10,ALEXIS>You know why?

982
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:21,860
<30-10,ALEXIS>因为她让你开心
<30-10,ALEXIS>Because she makes you happy,

983
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:24,680
<30-10,ALEXIS>就像派让我开心一样
<30-10,ALEXIS>the same way Pi makes me happy.

984
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:27,560
<30-10,ALEXIS>我所要求的不过是我给予你的
<30-10,ALEXIS>All I want is the same thing I'm giving you--

985
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,510
<30-10,ALEXIS>无条件的接受
<30-10,ALEXIS>acceptance.

986
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:33,910
<30-11,CASTLE>好吧  我接受他
<30-11,CASTLE>Okay. I accept him.

987
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:35,490
<30-11,CASTLE>不  你才没有接受
<30-11,CASTLE>No, you don't.

988
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:37,490
<30-12,ALEXIS>嘴上怎么说不重要
<30-12,ALEXIS>Because it's not about what you say.

989
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:38,770
<30-12,ALEXIS>心里的认同才算数
<30-12,ALEXIS>It's what's inside.

990
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:39,890
<30-12,ALEXIS>我知道  你心里还是抗拒的
<30-12,ALEXIS>I know what's there now,

991
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:41,920
<30-12,ALEXIS>我不想派感觉到你的抗拒
<30-12,ALEXIS>and I don't want Pi to feel that from you,

992
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:45,000
<30-12,ALEXIS>我也不想自己为此不开心
<30-12,ALEXIS>and... I don't wanna feel that either.

993
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:48,120
<30-12,ALEXIS>听着
<30-12,ALEXIS>Look...

994
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:51,420
<30-13,CASTLE>我会试着接受
<30-13,CASTLE>I'll work on it.

995
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:52,760
<30-13,CASTLE>我会的
<30-13,CASTLE>I will.

996
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:57,450
<30-13,CASTLE>与此同时  我们能不能一起去吃个雪糕
<30-13,CASTLE>Meantime, how about we go out for some makeup ice cream?

997
00:41:57,450 --> 00:41:58,640
<30-13,CASTLE>好不好  我请客
<30-13,CASTLE>Okay? My treat.

998
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:00,930
<30-13,CASTLE>不好
<30-13,CASTLE>No.

999
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:03,790
<30-14,ALEXIS>我需要时间冷静下来
<30-14,ALEXIS>I need time to stop being mad,

1000
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:06,450
<30-14,ALEXIS>你也需要时间学习
<30-14,ALEXIS>and you need time to figure out a way

1001
00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:08,130
<30-14,ALEXIS>怎么接受这一切
<30-14,ALEXIS>to be okay with this.

1002
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:12,740
<30-15,ALEXIS>回见  爸爸
<30-15,ALEXIS>I'll see you later, dad.
