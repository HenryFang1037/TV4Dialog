<4-6,CASTLE>快速婚礼教堂结婚很酷炫

<4-9,BECKETT>And I broke up with the guy a couple weeks later

95
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,600
<4-9,BECKETT>因为我发现他一再撒谎

96
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,640
<4-9,BECKETT>堕落腐化  还偷东西

<4-10,CASTLE>我还以为你是一生只结一次婚的姑娘
<4-10,CASTLE>And here I thought you were a one-and-done kind of girl.

00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,830
<4-11,MARTHA>你父亲知道这事吗
<4-11,MARTHA>Does your father know about this?

107
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,140
<5-3,BROWNING>恐怕结不成
<5-3,BROWNING>I'm afraid you can't.

108
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,460
<5-3,BROWNING>除非你先结束第一段婚姻
<5-3,BROWNING>Not unless you terminate your first marriage.

00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,720
<5-6,BROWNING>我可以让法院加速审核  但是
<5-6,BROWNING>and I could expedite it through the city, but...

00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,560
<6-3,CASTLE>法律上来说  他的确是
<6-3,CASTLE>Except, legally, he is.

122
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,140
<6-4,BECKETT>都有些什么资料
<6-4,BECKETT>So, what do we know about him?

130
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,300
<6-7,CASTLE>鉴于他的斑斑劣迹  我得说
<6-7,CASTLE>I must say, given his record,

131
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,490
<6-7,CASTLE>你能这么多年对他不离不弃真不简单

199
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,930

<10-4,BECKETT>还记得咱俩曾经去过拉斯维加斯吗
<10-4,BECKETT>Do you remember a trip that we took to Vegas?

206
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,850
<10-5,ROGAN>有点记不清了
<10-5,ROGAN>I don't know. It's a little fuzzy.

207
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:53,880
<10-5,ROGAN>不过  我最好的回忆大都是模糊的
<10-5,ROGAN>But, uh, most of my best memories are.

208
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:57,160
<10-6,BECKETT>那你还记不记得  当时我们
<10-6,BECKETT>So, when we were there, do you recall

<10-6,BECKETT>叫了一辆出租车  去了教堂
<10-6,BECKETT>a cab ride and a drive-up chapel?

00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,050
<10-7,ROGAN>忘了  但我记得
<10-7,ROGAN>Nope, but I do recall

211
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:03,600
<10-7,ROGAN>我们在一家脱衣舞店吃了霸王餐
<10-7,ROGAN>a dine-and-dash on the strip.

212
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,050
<10-7,ROGAN>还记得吗  吃的大三明治
<10-7,ROGAN>Do you remember... with the hoagies?

213
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:08,380
<10-7,ROGAN>在收银台时  "你们俩  滚出去"
<10-7,ROGAN>At the counter... "Hey, you! Get out of there!"

214
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,160
<10-8,BECKETT>你可能觉得这挺好玩的
<10-8,BECKETT>Well, you know what, you're probably gonna find this funny,

215
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,460
<10-8,BECKETT>但是  实际上
<10-8,BECKETT>but, as it turns out,

216
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,540
<10-8,BECKETT>你和我已经
<10-8,BECKETT>you and I have been...

217
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:18,080
<10-8,BECKETT>结婚  15年了
<10-8,BECKETT>married for...15 years.

218
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,330
<10-9,ROGAN>结婚
<10-9,ROGAN>Married?

219
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:20,780
<10-11,ROGAN>真的吗
<10-11,ROGAN>For realsies?

220
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,340
<10-12,BECKETT>是的
<10-12,BECKETT>Yeah.

221
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,040
<10-13,ROGAN>太搞笑了

224
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:29,420
<10-14,BECKETT>不过  也不是什么大事
<10-14,BECKETT>But you know what, it's not a big deal,

225
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:32,200
<10-14,BECKETT>因为你需要做的只是
<10-14,BECKETT>Because all you have to do is...

226
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:33,930
<10-14,BECKETT>签了这个
<10-14,BECKETT>sign this...

227
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:36,110
<10-14,BECKETT>然后你就恢复自由了
<10-14,BECKETT>and you're off the hook.

228
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:38,000
<10-11,ROGAN>好  好  好

231
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,050
<10-15,ROGAN>这种不自由也挺好的
<10-15,ROGAN>it is a pretty nice hook, you know?

232
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,310
<10-15,ROGAN>见鬼  咱俩都结婚这么久了
<10-15,ROGAN>I mean, heck, we have been married this long.

233
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:50,430
<10-15,ROGAN>或许我们可以再给彼此一次机会
<10-15,ROGAN>Maybe we should just give it a chance...

234
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,410
<10-15,ROGAN>不吗  好吧
<10-15,ROGAN>No. I know, I know.

<10-21,ROGAN>我...
<10-21,ROGAN>I...

249
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,980
<10-22,BECKETT>我很抱歉
<10-22,BECKETT>You know, I'm sorry.

250
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,540
<10-22,BECKETT>你肯定很忙  我应该走了
<10-22,BECKETT>I...I... you're obviously busy, and I should probably just go.

251
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,490
<10-22,BECKETT>但麻烦你签了这个
<10-22,BECKETT>But if you could just sign this...

252
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:33,620
<10-23,ROGAN>好的  当然
<10-23,ROGAN>No. Yeah. Of course.

253
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:36,140
<10-23,ROGAN>我很愿意
<10-23,ROGAN>I'd... I would... I would really love to sign

254
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,770
<10-23,ROGAN>-签这份离婚协议  -很好
<10-23,ROGAN>- this dissolution-of-marriage agreement for you. - Great.

255
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:42,870
<10-25,ROGAN>不过  你得先帮我做件事
<10-25,ROGAN>But...you're gonna have to do something for me first.

256
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:47,890
<10-25,ROGAN>好了
<10-25,ROGAN>Okay.

257
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,540
<11-1,ALEXIS>要那一条
<11-1,ALEXIS>Which one?

258
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,580
<11-2,ESPOSITO>朴素点的  也就是这条
<11-2,ESPOSITO>The easy one, which is this one.

259
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:52,250
<11-2,ESPOSITO>谢谢
<11-2,ESPOSITO>Thank you.

260
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,210
<11-2,ESPOSITO>贝克特有消息了吗
<11-2,ESPOSITO>Any news from Beckett?

261
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,900
<11-3,CASTLE>几个小时前她给我发了短信
<11-3,CASTLE>Uh, she texted me a couple hours ago --

262
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,270
<11-3,CASTLE>说她找到了  之后就没消息了
<11-3,CASTLE>Said she'd found him, but I haven't heard from her since.

263
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,430
<11-4,ESPOSITO>可能他们在叙旧
<11-4,ESPOSITO>Maybe they're catching up.

264
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,350
<11-5,CASTLE>是啊  他们有挺多共同点的
<11-5,CASTLE>Sure. No, sure. They got a lot in common.

265
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:03,890
<11-5,CASTLE>她可以聊聊那些被她送进监狱的人
<11-5,CASTLE>She can talk about all the people she's put in prison,

266
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:06,130
<11-5,CASTLE>他可以聊聊那些他在监狱遇到的人
<11-5,CASTLE>And he can talk about all the people he's met in prison.

267
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:10,060
<11-6,RYAN>阿丽克西斯  我还没发福到这个程度
<11-6,RYAN>Um, Alexis, I haven't gained this much daddy weight.

268
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:10,750
<11-6,RYAN>不可能
<11-6,RYAN>That can't be right.

269
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,010
<11-7,ALEXIS>我检查尺寸检查了十遍
<11-7,ALEXIS>I double-checked the size 10 times.

270
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:13,990
<11-8,ESPOSITO>也许是你终于
<11-8,ESPOSITO>Hey, maybe you finally hit

271
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:16,020
<11-8,ESPOSITO>等到了你的生长周期  兄弟
<11-8,ESPOSITO>that growth spurt you've been waiting on, bro.

272
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:19,890
<11-9,CASTLE>她来电话了
<11-9,CASTLE>And that's her.

273
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:21,480
<11-9,CASTLE>还好吗
<11-9,CASTLE>Hey. What's up?

274
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:24,560
<11-10,BECKETT>我遇到了点小麻烦
<11-10,BECKETT>Okay, so, there has been a little glitch.

275
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,620
<11-11,CASTLE>-他不愿意签字吗  -不是  他愿意
<11-11,CASTLE>- He won't sign? - Oh, no. He'll sign,

276
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,560
<11-12,BECKETT>但是他让我先替他做件事
<11-12,BECKETT>But he wants me to do something first.

277
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,680
<11-13,CASTLE>什么样的事
<11-13,CASTLE>What kind of thing?

278
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,810
<11-14,BECKETT>他让我从他前女友的卡车里
<11-14,BECKETT>He wants me to break into his ex-girlfriend's truck

279
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:33,920
<11-14,BECKETT>帮他偷一个车库开门器
<11-14,BECKETT>and steal a garage-door opener.

280
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,040
<11-15,CASTLE>好吧  为什么呢
<11-15,CASTLE>O...kay. Why?

281
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,570
<11-16,BECKETT>看来  他们俩分手后
<11-16,BECKETT>Apparently, after they broke up,

282
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:40,360
<11-16,BECKETT>他前女友拿走了他的一些东西
<11-16,BECKETT>his ex-girlfriend took a few of his things,

283
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,470
<11-16,BECKETT>他想要回来
<11-16,BECKETT>and he wants them back.

284
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:45,290
<11-17,CASTLE>他需要拿车库钥匙进他女友家吗
<11-17,CASTLE>And he needs the garage-door opener to get into her place?

285
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,610
<11-18,BECKETT>是她妈妈的家  但是也对
<11-18,BECKETT>Her...mom's place, but yeah.

286
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:49,980
<11-19,CASTLE>鉴于他的种种案底  他怎么不自己去偷
<11-19,CASTLE>But given his record, why doesn't he just steal it himself?

287
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,540
<11-20,BECKETT>因为她的卡车就停在她酒吧的外面
<11-20,BECKETT>Because her truck is parked right outside of her bar,

288
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:53,710
<11-20,BECKETT>他靠近不了
<11-20,BECKETT>and he can't get close to it

289
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:56,240
<11-20,BECKETT>因为有人看见他就会告诉他前女友
<11-20,BECKETT>without someone spotting him and then telling her.

290
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,280
<11-21,CASTLE>你真的要这么做
<11-21,CASTLE>And you're actually thinking about doing this?

291
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,830
<11-22,BECKETT>如果我不干  他就不会签字
<11-22,BECKETT>If I don't, he won't sign.

292
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:02,490
<11-22,BECKETT>卡塞尔  他可以拖上好几年
<11-22,BECKETT>Castle, he could drag this on for years.

293
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:03,900
<11-23,CASTLE>要是你被抓到怎么办
<11-23,CASTLE>And if you get caught?

294
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:04,850
<11-23,CASTLE>不会的
<11-23,CASTLE>I won't.

295
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,640
<11-24,BECKETT>听着卡塞尔  我只有乖乖听他的
<11-24,BECKETT>Look, Castle, he's got me over a barrel here.

296
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:10,180
<11-24,BECKETT>如果我不做  我们就结不了婚
<11-24,BECKETT>If I don't do this, we don't get married.

297
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,950
<11-25,CASTLE>赶紧弄完就回家吧
<11-25,CASTLE>Just get this over with and come home.

298
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,450
<11-26,BECKETT>事情办好我就给你打电话
<11-26,BECKETT>I'll call you when I'm done.

299
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,170
<12-1,BECKETT>完成任务
<12-1,BECKETT>Mission accomplished.

300
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:06,530
<12-2,CASTLE>你拿到车库的遥控了
<12-2,CASTLE>So, you got the remote?

301
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:08,180
<12-3,BECKETT>是的  没有被抓住
<12-3,BECKETT>Yes. And I wasn't caught.

302
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:10,070
<12-4,CASTLE>你确定他现在就会签字了吗
<12-4,CASTLE>And you're sure he'll sign the papers now?

303
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,070
<12-5,BECKETT>他肯定会签的
<12-5,BECKETT>Oh, he's gonna sign them, all right.

304
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,620
<12-5,BECKETT>我不会让他说不的
<12-5,BECKETT>I'm not taking "No" for an answer.

305
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,670
<12-5,BECKETT>告诉大家婚礼如期举行
<12-5,BECKETT>Tell everyone that this wedding is on.

306
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,700
<12-5,BECKETT>我很快就会回来的
<12-5,BECKETT>I'll be on my way back to the city soon.

307
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,760
<12-5,BECKETT>-我等不及了  -再见
<12-5,BECKETT>- Can't wait. - Bye.

308
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,110
<13-1,THUG>给我回来  罗根
<13-1,THUG>Get back here, Rogan!

309
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,670
<13-2,BECKETT>-够了  伙计  够了  -罗根
<13-2,BECKETT>- All right, man! All right! - Rogan!

310
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,380
<13-2,BECKETT>停下
<13-2,BECKETT>Stop!

311
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,320
<13-3,BECKETT>有没有搞错
<13-3,BECKETT>Really?!

312
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,910
<13-3,BECKETT>你看到车牌了吗
<13-3,BECKETT>Did you get the license of the truck?

313
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:54,930
<14-1,DEPUTY>那车没有车牌
<14-1,DEPUTY>It didn't have one.

314
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,580
<14-2,BECKETT>但是那两个人都带着面具
<14-2,BECKETT>But both of the men were wearing masks.

315
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,440
<14-3,DEPUTY>你的朋友被他们带走了  他叫什么
<14-3,DEPUTY>And your friend who got taken -- what's his name?

316
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:01,430
<14-4,BECKETT>罗根  罗根·奥拉里
<14-4,BECKETT>Rogan -- Rogan O'Leary.

317
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,090
<14-5,BECKETT>什么  你为什么合上笔记本
<14-5,BECKETT>What -- why are you closing your notebook?

318
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:08,290
<14-6,DEPUTY>女士  我们部门没有闲暇
<14-6,DEPUTY>Ma'am, our department doesn't have the resources

319
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:11,660
<14-6,DEPUTY>调查奥拉里先生的每件案子
<14-6,DEPUTY>to investigate every claim involving Mr. O'Leary.

320
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:12,960
<14-7,BECKETT>可有人把他带走了
<14-7,BECKETT>But someone took him.

321
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,180
<14-8,DEPUTY>是啊
<14-8,DEPUTY>I'm sure they did.

322
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,890
<14-8,DEPUTY>而且他们肯定有充分理由这么做
<14-8,DEPUTY>I'm sure they had a very good reason.

323
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:16,970
<14-8,DEPUTY>过了几天
<14-8,DEPUTY>And in a few days,

324
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,900
<14-8,DEPUTY>他就会出现  喝得烂醉  满身淤青  痛苦不堪
<14-8,DEPUTY>he'll show up drunk, bruised, and sorry as hell.

325
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:23,310
<14-9,BECKETT>我等不了那么多天  我现在就得找到他
<14-9,BECKETT>I don't have a few days. I need to find him now.

326
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,740
<14-10,DEPUTY>女士  作为女人跟你说句心里话
<14-10,DEPUTY>Ma'am, from one woman to another...

327
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,920
<14-10,DEPUTY>放手吧
<14-10,DEPUTY>Let him go.

328
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:34,750
<15-1,CASTLE>他被绑架了  怎么会  可是
<15-1,CASTLE>He's been abducted?! H-how -- but --

329
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,490
<15-2,BECKETT>-是啊  我也不敢相信  -好吧
<15-2,BECKETT>- I know. I don't believe it, either. - O-okay.

330
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:40,620
<15-3,CASTLE>我讨厌这样  但我们是不是该推迟一下
<15-3,CASTLE>I hate to ask, but do you think maybe we should postpone?

331
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,780
<15-4,BECKETT>不  我不会放弃的  我要找到他
<15-4,BECKETT>No. No, I'm not giving up. I'm gonna find him.

332
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:44,240
<15-5,CASTLE>-怎么找  -我可是个警探
<15-5,CASTLE>- How? - Well, I'm a detective.

333
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,700
<15-6,BECKETT>肯定有人知道一些情况
<15-6,BECKETT>Someone here has to know something.

334
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,000
<15-7,CASTLE>你不该一个人去做  我马上赶过来
<15-7,CASTLE>You shouldn't be doing this alone. I'm coming up there.

335
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:49,690
<15-8,BECKETT>-真的吗  -是的
<15-8,BECKETT>- Are you sure? - Yes.

336
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:52,950
<15-9,CASTLE>当然  这里的一切都布置好了
<15-9,CASTLE>Absolutely. E-everything here is completely under control.

337
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:54,960
<15-9,CASTLE>几小时后见
<15-9,CASTLE>I-I will see you in a few hours.

338
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:56,440
<15-9,CASTLE>再见
<15-9,CASTLE>Bye.

339
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:02,010
<15-10,CASTLE>你好
<15-10,CASTLE>Hello?

340
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,860
<15-10,CASTLE>我是理查德·卡塞尔
<15-10,CASTLE>Yes, this is Richard Castle.

341
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:11,190
<15-10,CASTLE>什么
<15-10,CASTLE>What?

342
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:13,260
<16-1,ALEXIS>婚礼会场不能用了
<16-1,ALEXIS>We lost our venue?

343
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:15,000
<16-1,ALEXIS>怎么可能呢
<16-1,ALEXIS>How is that even possible?!

344
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,860
<16-2,CASTLE>他们今晚办了个马戏团聚会
<16-2,CASTLE>They had a circus party there tonight

345
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,250
<16-2,CASTLE>有人表演了喷火的把戏
<16-2,CASTLE>with some first-time fire breathers.

346
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,690
<16-2,CASTLE>现在我们的顶楼宴会厅没有台子了
<16-2,CASTLE>Now our rooftop venue does not have a floor.

347
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:21,740
<16-3,ALEXIS>这就是一场灾难
<16-3,ALEXIS>This is a disaster.

348
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:24,270
<16-4,CASTLE>结婚的地方没了  结婚的对象也不在
<16-4,CASTLE>No place to get married and no one to get married to.

349
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:26,050
<16-4,CASTLE>这都不是灾难二字就可以描述的
<16-4,CASTLE>I think "Disaster" is an understatement.

350
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:29,020
<16-5,MARTHA>所谓的灾难其实就是隐藏的机遇
<16-5,MARTHA>So-called "Disaster" is merely opportunity in disguise.

351
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:31,000
<16-5,MARTHA>我们重新找一个地方举办婚礼就行了
<16-5,MARTHA>We'll just find another place to hold the wedding.

352
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:31,940
<16-6,CASTLE>开什么玩笑
<16-6,CASTLE>Are you kidding?

353
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,370
<16-6,CASTLE>在曼哈顿我们两天之内
<16-6,CASTLE>Where are we gonna find a venue in Manhattan

354
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:36,090
<16-6,CASTLE>上哪去找一个能容下300人的宴会厅
<16-6,CASTLE>that holds 300 people -- in less than two days?

355
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,670
<16-7,ALEXIS>我们已经有个地方了
<16-7,ALEXIS>Ooh! We already have one.

356
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,320
<16-7,ALEXIS>不在曼哈顿
<16-7,ALEXIS>Not in Manhattan.

357
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,760
<16-7,ALEXIS>我们可以在汉普斯顿的房子举办婚礼
<16-7,ALEXIS>We can move the whole party to our house in the Hamptons.

358
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:44,420
<16-8,CASTLE>对呀
<16-8,CASTLE>Yes.

359
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:45,870
<16-8,CASTLE>对呀
<16-8,CASTLE>Yes!

360
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:48,260
<16-8,CASTLE>我们在那儿办过更大的聚会呢
<16-8,CASTLE>We've held larger parties than this out there.

361
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,470
<16-9,ALEXIS>我们可以租豪车接客人过去
<16-9,ALEXIS>We rent luxury buses to shuttle our guests

362
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:52,580
<16-9,ALEXIS>给婚庆公司报销车费
<16-9,ALEXIS>and pay the vendors' transportation costs.

363
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:53,240
<16-9,ALEXIS>太聪明了
<16-9,ALEXIS>Brilliant!

364
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,120
<16-10,MARTHA>早上我会第一时间给管家打电话
<16-10,MARTHA>I will call the housekeeper first thing in the morning

365
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,870
<16-10,MARTHA>让他们把地方准备好
<16-10,MARTHA>and have them start getting the place ready.

366
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,410
<16-11,CASTLE>你确定这样行得通
<16-11,CASTLE>You really think we can pull this off?

367
00:14:58,410 --> 00:14:59,670
<16-12,MARTHA>拜托
<16-12,MARTHA>Oh, please!

368
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:02,780
<16-12,MARTHA>我们公司没有地方的时候
<16-12,MARTHA>I once staged "A chorus line" on a subway platform

369
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,530
<16-12,MARTHA>我还在地铁站台拍演了《平步青云》
<16-12,MARTHA>when our company lost its space.

370
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:06,110
<16-12,MARTHA>我觉得我可以办得到
<16-12,MARTHA>I think I can move a wedding.

371
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:08,320
<16-12,MARTHA>阿丽克西斯会帮忙的
<16-12,MARTHA>Alexis will help with everything.

372
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:09,930
<16-12,MARTHA>你只要保证
<16-12,MARTHA>You just make sure

373
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:13,860
<16-12,MARTHA>凯瑟琳找到她那个游手好闲的丈夫
<16-12,MARTHA>Katherine finds - that deadbeat husband of hers.

374
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:14,930
<16-12,MARTHA>好了
<16-12,MARTHA>Yes.

375
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:19,560
<17-1,BECKETT>谢谢你能赶过来  宝贝
<17-1,BECKETT>Thanks for coming up, babe.

376
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,960
<17-1,BECKETT>真抱歉这场乌龙
<17-1,BECKETT>I'm so sorry about this whole mess.

377
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,150
<17-2,CASTLE>未婚夫不就是应该帮助
<17-2,CASTLE>Oh, what's a fiance for, if not to help find

378
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:25,770
<17-2,CASTLE>未婚妻找到现任丈夫的嘛
<17-2,CASTLE>his future wife's current husband?

379
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,490
<17-2,CASTLE>况且没有我的干扰  阿丽克西斯和我妈
<17-2,CASTLE>And Alexis and mother will get far more done

380
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,510
<17-2,CASTLE>会更有效率
<17-2,CASTLE>without my interference.

381
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:31,470
<17-3,BECKETT>我只希望她们不是徒劳
<17-3,BECKETT>Well, I just hope that all their work is not for nothing.

382
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,750
<17-4,CASTLE>你觉得罗根的前女友能帮我们找到他
<17-4,CASTLE>You think Rogan's ex will be able to help us find him?

383
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:34,990
<17-5,BECKETT>他们曾经同居
<17-5,BECKETT>They lived together.

384
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:37,280
<17-5,BECKETT>如果我们走运的话  她可能知道
<17-5,BECKETT>If we're lucky, she'll be able to tell us

385
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,550
<17-5,BECKETT>他惹上了什么麻烦
<17-5,BECKETT>what kind of mess he was mixed up in.

386
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:41,410
<17-6,CLORIS MAGUIRE>有什么事吗
<17-6,CLORIS MAGUIRE>Can I help you?

387
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:44,110
<17-7,BECKETT>你好  女士
<17-7,BECKETT>Uh, hi, ma'am.

388
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,850
<17-7,BECKETT>纽约警察  我们在找罗根·奥拉里
<17-7,BECKETT>NYPD. We're looking for Rogan O'Leary.

389
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:49,790
<17-8,CLORIS>你们要是找到他就别让他回来了
<17-8,CLORIS>Well, if you find him, you can keep him.

390
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,240
<17-9,TILDY>老妈  别说了
<17-9,TILDY>Stop it, mama.

391
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,100
<17-9,TILDY>昨天在酒吧看到你了
<17-9,TILDY>You were in the bar yesterday.

392
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,170
<17-10,BECKETT>对  我是想找奥拉里先生帮忙
<17-10,BECKETT>Yeah, I was hoping - that Mr. O'Leary could help us

393
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:00,100
<17-10,BECKETT>破一件陈年旧案
<17-10,BECKETT>with...an old case,

394
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,210
<17-10,BECKETT>但他昨晚好像被绑架了
<17-10,BECKETT>but it seems that he was abducted last night.

395
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:02,800
<17-11,TILDY>有谁会绑架他
<17-11,TILDY>By who?

396
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:04,630
<17-12,CASTLE>我们希望你能提供点线索
<17-12,CASTLE>We were hoping you could tell us.

397
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:07,620
<17-13,CLORIS>可不是我  要我直接杀了他
<17-13,CLORIS>Wasn't me. I'd have offed him.

398
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,270
<17-14,TILDY>老妈  够了
<17-14,TILDY>Mama, that's enough.

399
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:12,530
<17-15,BECKETT>他是被两个男人拖上一辆生锈的皮卡带走的
<17-15,BECKETT>Look, he was taken by two men in a rusty pickup truck.

400
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:14,000
<17-15,BECKETT>你知道他们是谁吗
<17-15,BECKETT>Do you have any idea who they were?

401
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,670
<17-15,BECKETT>不知道
<17-15,BECKETT>No.

402
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:19,100
<17-16,TILDY>但他总是用各种方式惹恼别人
<17-16,TILDY>But he's always working crazy angles, pissing people off.

403
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,800
<17-17,CASTLE>你是因为这个和他分手的吗
<17-17,CASTLE>Is that why you left him?

404
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,520
<17-17,CASTLE>不
<17-17,CASTLE>No.

405
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:23,310
<17-18,TILDY>这我都习惯了
<17-18,TILDY>I was used to that.

406
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:27,010
<17-18,TILDY>他从我这拿了钱要筹划些什么
<17-18,TILDY>But he took money from me for one of his schemes --

407
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:28,510
<17-18,TILDY>说会让我们暴富
<17-18,TILDY>said he was gonna make us rich.

408
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:31,780
<17-18,TILDY>当然钱都打水漂了  我可能连酒吧都保不住
<17-18,TILDY>He lost it all, of course. Now I might lose the bar.

409
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:34,550
<17-18,TILDY>但即便他劣迹斑斑
<17-18,TILDY>Thing is, in spite of it all...

410
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,240
<17-18,TILDY>我还是爱他
<17-18,TILDY>I love him.

411
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,540
<17-18,TILDY>我可以忽视
<17-18,TILDY>I mean, I can overlook the fact that --

412
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,140
<17-18,TILDY>他没有正规工作
<17-18,TILDY>That he's not - a "Regular job" Kind of guy

413
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,740
<17-18,TILDY>或者他因为昏迷的妻子而不能和我结婚
<17-18,TILDY>or that he can't marry me while his wife's in a coma,

414
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:47,900
<17-18,TILDY>但他不该危及我的酒吧
<17-18,TILDY>but he should never have put my bar in jeopardy.

415
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:51,950
<17-19,BECKETT>抱歉  他说他有个妻子
<17-19,BECKETT>I'm sorry -- - he said that he had a wife?

416
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,410
<17-20,CASTLE>昏迷的妻子
<17-20,CASTLE>A wife in a coma?

417
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:57,110
<17-21,TILDY>对  他俩在学校时候结的婚  她出了事故
<17-21,TILDY>Yeah. He married in college. She got in an accident.

418
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:59,070
<17-21,TILDY>昏迷15年了
<17-21,TILDY>Been in a coma 15 years.

419
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,630
<17-21,TILDY>好像叫"凯蒂"什么的
<17-21,TILDY>"Katie"...Something.

420
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,930
<17-22,TILDY>挺凄惨的
<17-22,TILDY>It's kind of tragic, really.

421
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:06,040
<17-23,CASTLE>确实非常凄惨
<17-23,CASTLE>So very tragic.

422
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:11,060
<17-24,BECKETT>他昨天提到什么麻烦了吗
<17-24,BECKETT>Did he mention any trouble yesterday?

423
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:14,170
<17-24,BECKETT>或者有没有说他非常需要
<17-24,BECKETT>Or say anything about you having something in your possession

424
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:15,630
<17-24,BECKETT>你的什么东西
<17-24,BECKETT>that he urgently needed?

425
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,070
<17-24,BECKETT>车库或房子里的什么东西
<17-24,BECKETT>Something in the garage or house?

426
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,040
<17-25,TILDY>对  想起来了
<17-25,TILDY>Actually, yeah.

427
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:22,150
<17-25,TILDY>他说想要我从他公寓拿的那台笔记本电脑
<17-25,TILDY>He said he needed the laptop I took from his apartment.

428
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:23,920
<17-25,TILDY>还说马上就要
<17-25,TILDY>Said he needed it right away.

429
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,890
<17-26,CASTLE>他说为什么了吗
<17-26,CASTLE>Did he say why?

430
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,520
<17-27,TILDY>没有  但那是我的电脑
<17-27,TILDY>No, but since it's my laptop,

431
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:29,020
<17-27,TILDY>我估计他是胡扯
<17-27,TILDY>I figured it was a line of bull,

432
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,700
<17-27,TILDY>只是想让我把电脑给他
<17-27,TILDY>that he wanted me to give it up

433
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,220
<17-27,TILDY>然后他好卖了换钱罢了
<17-27,TILDY>so he could sell it for the money.

434
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:34,760
<17-28,CASTLE>他这么着急想要拿到电脑
<17-28,CASTLE>Given how anxious he was to get his hands on it,

435
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,410
<17-28,CASTLE>这可能和他被绑架有关
<17-28,CASTLE>it might have something to do with his abduction.

436
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:38,260
<17-29,BECKETT>蒂尔迪  我们能借用一下这台电脑吗
<17-29,BECKETT>Tildy, could we borrow that laptop?

437
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:40,790
<17-29,BECKETT>或许能帮我们找到他
<17-29,BECKETT>Might help us find him.

438
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:42,870
<17-30,CASTLE>我们是破案专家
<17-30,CASTLE>We are trained professionals,

439
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:46,510
<17-30,CASTLE>罗根可能惹上了大麻烦
<17-30,CASTLE>and Rogan might be in some very, very serious trouble.

440
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,880
<18-1,BECKETT>他确实有麻烦了
<18-1,BECKETT>He's in trouble, all right.

441
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,080
<18-1,BECKETT>这么多年  他一直知道我们结了婚
<18-1,BECKETT>I mean, all these years, he knew that we were married.

442
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,290
<18-1,BECKETT>我来的时候他就知道
<18-1,BECKETT>He knew when I got here.

443
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:55,170
<18-1,BECKETT>而15年来
<18-1,BECKETT>And for 15 years,

444
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:57,730
<18-1,BECKETT>他居然一直用这个借口来逃避婚姻
<18-1,BECKETT>he's been using that as an excuse not to commit.

445
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:58,770
<18-2,CASTLE>昏迷中的妻子
<18-2,CASTLE>Coma wife...

446
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,800
<18-2,CASTLE>很有才嘛
<18-2,CASTLE>it's kind of brilliant.

447
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,310
<18-3,BECKETT>你是说"卑鄙"吧
<18-3,BECKETT>You mean "Despicable," Right?

448
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,690
<18-4,CASTLE>对  我...就是这个意思
<18-4,CASTLE>Yeah. That's...what I meant.

449
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,480
<18-5,BECKETT>你在电脑上发现什么了吗
<18-5,BECKETT>Did you find anything on the laptop?

450
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:09,500
<18-6,CASTLE>他们的往来邮件都相当色情
<18-6,CASTLE>Their e-mails to each other are fairly pornographic,

451
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,210
<18-6,CASTLE>但这都不是被绑架的原因
<18-6,CASTLE>but nothing - that would get a man abducted.

452
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,320
<18-7,BECKETT>也许我们该打电话给托瑞
<18-7,BECKETT>You know what -- maybe we should call Tory

453
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,130
<18-7,BECKETT>让她远程访问  看看我们有没有漏掉什么
<18-7,BECKETT>and have her access it remotely, see if we're missing anything.

454
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:16,810
<18-8,CASTLE>我们应该再去罗根的公寓
<18-8,CASTLE>And we should re-check Rogan's apartment --

455
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:17,730
<18-8,CASTLE>查查有没有线索
<18-8,CASTLE>see if there's anything there

456
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,440
<18-8,CASTLE>能让我们知道他惹了什么麻烦
<18-8,CASTLE>that could tell us what he was involved with.

457
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:20,970
<18-9,BECKETT>我得给蕾妮打个电话
<18-9,BECKETT>I got to call Lanie.

458
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,560

<18-9,BECKETT>I'm not gonna make my spa bachelorette party this afternoon.

459

470
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:53,500

508
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:17,590
<22-21,BECKETT>我得知道我的钱花在了哪里
<22-21,BECKETT>then tell me what I'm paying for.

509
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:21,320
<22-22,HEAD BIKER>好吧  也算合理

<22-30,CASTLE>我想你应该不收支票吧
<22-30,CASTLE>I don't suppose you'd take a check.

526

<22-31,BECKETT>我们还需要一点时间
<22-31,BECKETT>We just need a little bit more time.

<22-32,HEAD BIKER>再给你们12小时
<22-32,HEAD BIKER>You bought yourself 12 hours.

532
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:11,730
<22-33,HEAD BIKER>如果我回来的时候你们凑不齐钱
<22-33,HEAD BIKER>If you don't have the full amount when I come back,

<22-33,HEAD BIKER>我就打断你们的腿
<22-33,HEAD BIKER>I start breaking legs.

534
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,820
<22-33,HEAD BIKER>明白了吗
<22-33,HEAD BIKER>Do you understand?

<23-2,CASTLE>我很喜欢我的腿  还有你的
<23-2,CASTLE>I happen to like my legs -- and yours, too.

538
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:29,260
<23-2,CASTLE>为什么你老公要花5000块让摩托手
<23-2,CASTLE>And why is your husband paying bikers over 5 grand

539
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,780
<23-2,CASTLE>偷一部脱衣舞女的手机
<23-2,CASTLE>for a stripper's phone?

540
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:33,720
<23-3,BECKETT>首先  能别叫他我老公吗
<23-3,BECKETT>First of all, can we please stop calling him my husband?

541
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,690
<23-3,BECKETT>其次  我不知道  不过我猜
<23-3,BECKETT>And secondly, I don't know, but I'm guessing

542
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:38,120
<23-3,BECKETT>这一定和绑架有关
<23-3,BECKETT>it has something to do with the abduction.

543
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,570
<23-3,BECKETT>喂  我是贝克特
<23-3,BECKETT>Hey. It's Beckett.

<23-3,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你能查一下那个旅馆的地址吗
<23-3,BECKETT>Castle, can you look up the address to the roadhouse?

546
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,510
<23-3,BECKETT>我想知道脱衣舞女的手机上究竟有什么
<23-3,BECKETT>I want to know what was on that stripper's phone.

547
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:50,840
<23-4,CASTLE>找一家本地脱衣舞酒吧

00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,190
<24-5,SAPPHIRE>就是部手机而已

00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:57,580
<24-19,LANIE>可婚纱已经被毁得不像样了
<24-19,LANIE>but there was just too much damage.

581
00:22:59,210 --> 00:22:59,990
<24-19,LANIE>凯特
<24-19,LANIE>Kate...

582
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:01,570
<24-20,LANIE>那个婚纱
<24-20,LANIE>The dress,

583
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,350
<24-20,LANIE>没法再穿了
<24-20,LANIE>it's gone!

584
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,810
<25-1,CASTLE>一件婚纱而已  又不是世界末日
<25-1,CASTLE>It's only a dress. It's not the end of the world.

585
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:13,720
<25-2,BECKETT>我怎么觉得就是呢
<25-2,BECKETT>Then why does it feel like it is?

586
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:16,100
<25-2,BECKETT>我们的婚礼应该如童话一般
<25-2,BECKETT>Our wedding was supposed to be magical.

587
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,140
<25-2,BECKETT>应该是我俩最完美的一天
<25-2,BECKETT>It was supposed to be our perfect day.

588
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,310
<25-2,BECKETT>可现在却...
<25-2,BECKETT>And now it's just...

589
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:22,350
<25-2,BECKETT>支离破碎
<25-2,BECKETT>falling apart.

590
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:24,080
<25-3,CASTLE>那我们就一起把它拼凑起来
<25-3,CASTLE>So we'll put it back together.

591
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,200
<25-4,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我现在还是别人的妻子
<25-4,BECKETT>Castle, I'm married to someone else.

592
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,470
<25-4,BECKETT>我还不知道那个人在哪里
<25-4,BECKETT>And I have no idea where he is.

593
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:29,590
<25-4,BECKETT>我们一点线索也没有
<25-4,BECKETT>We don't have any leads.

594
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:32,150
<25-4,BECKETT>雪上加霜的先是会场  现在又来这个
<25-4,BECKETT>And to make things worse, the venue, and then now this?

595
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:36,360
<25-4,BECKETT>感觉这就像是一个强烈的征兆
<25-4,BECKETT>I mean, it just feels like all of this is one big sign.

596
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:39,180
<25-5,CASTLE>也许这就是一个征兆
<25-5,CASTLE>Well, maybe it is a sign.

597
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:43,820
<25-5,CASTLE>预示着我们爱情  是伟大的
<25-5,CASTLE>A sign that ours is a great love story.

598
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,190
<25-5,CASTLE>毕竟哪个伟大的爱情故事
<25-5,CASTLE>'Cause what's a great love story

599
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:47,880
<25-5,CASTLE>不是经历了重重阻挠呢
<25-5,CASTLE>without obstacles to overcome?

600
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:50,240
<25-5,CASTLE>每个童话故事里都有
<25-5,CASTLE>Every fairy tale has them,

601
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,390
<25-5,CASTLE>唯有真爱才能穿过种种阻碍
<25-5,CASTLE>terrible trials that only the worthy can transcend.

602
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:57,090
<25-5,CASTLE>但你不能放弃
<25-5,CASTLE>But you can't give up.

603
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,270
<25-5,CASTLE>事情就是如此
<25-5,CASTLE>That's the deal.

604
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:02,630
<25-5,CASTLE>如果我们想要幸福美满  就不能放弃
<25-5,CASTLE>We want the happy ending, we can't give up.

605
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:08,380
<25-6,BECKETT>这就是我要嫁给你的原因
<25-6,BECKETT>And that's why I want to marry you.

607
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,930
<25-7,BECKETT>我是托瑞
<25-7,BECKETT>Hey, it's Tory.

608
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:22,780
<25-8,TORY ELLIS>我想我找到了线索
<25-8,TORY ELLIS>I think I may have found something.

609
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:25,130
<25-8,TORY ELLIS>我搜查了那台笔记本
<25-8,TORY ELLIS>I was scrubbing the laptop

610
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,150
<25-8,TORY ELLIS>结果找到了一个隐藏文件夹
<25-8,TORY ELLIS>and came across a hidden folder.

611
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:28,400
<25-9,BECKETT>里面有什么
<25-9,BECKETT>What's in it?

612
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:29,660
<25-9,BECKETT>照片
<25-9,BECKETT>Pictures.

613
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:30,840
<25-10,TORY>从照片属性来看
<25-10,TORY>According to image data,

614
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,380
<25-10,TORY>它们是最近从某人的手机里下载下来的
<25-10,TORY>they were recently downloaded from someone's phone.

615
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:36,650
<25-10,TORY>大部分都无关紧要  不过其中有几张
<25-10,TORY>Most of them are innocuous, but there are a couple of them

616
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:39,670
<25-10,TORY>我觉得你有必要看一下
<25-10,TORY>that, um... I think you need to see.

617
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:40,690
<25-11,CASTLE>我给你发过去了
<25-11,CASTLE>I'm e-mailing them now.

618
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:47,230
<25-12,BECKETT>怎么了
<25-12,BECKETT>What?

619
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,090
<25-13,BECKETT>我想我知道你鬼鬼祟祟的老公为什么
<25-13,BECKETT>I think I know why - your scheming, scamming husband

620
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:52,110
<25-13,BECKETT>想偷这个脱衣舞女的手机了
<25-13,BECKETT>wanted to steal that stripper's phone.

621
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,180
<25-13,BECKETT>仔细看看
<25-13,BECKETT>Check it out.

622
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,680
<25-14,BECKETT>就是一男的看脱衣舞  有什么了不得的
<25-14,BECKETT>It's a guy with a stripper. What's the big deal?

623
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,570
<25-14,BECKETT>有什么了不得的
<25-14,BECKETT>What's the big deal?

624
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,710
<25-15,CASTLE>十分了不得
<25-15,CASTLE>That is the big deal.

625
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:02,350
<25-15,CASTLE>这是当地的牧师
<25-15,CASTLE>It's the local pastor.

626
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:05,100
<25-15,CASTLE>能让你老公花大钱换照片的原因
<25-15,CASTLE>There's only one reason your husband would pay that much

627
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,340
<25-15,CASTLE>只有一个
<25-15,CASTLE>to get these photos.

628
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,240
<25-15,CASTLE>他在敲诈上帝的仆人
<25-15,CASTLE>He was blackmailing a man of God.

629
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,360
<25-16,BECKETT>一位乐享淫欲的牧师
<25-16,BECKETT>A pastor with skin in the game.

630
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:13,470
<25-17,CASTLE>他有充分的动机想让罗根消失
<25-17,CASTLE>And motive to make Rogan disappear.

631
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,150
<26-1,BECKETT>谢谢您能见我们  牧师
<26-1,BECKETT>Thank you for meeting with us, pastor.

632
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:21,200
<26-2,PASTOR BOB>你在电话里说事出紧急
<26-2,PASTOR BOB>Well, you said on the phone it was urgent,

633
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:24,220
<26-2,PASTOR BOB>而救人于危急是我的使命
<26-2,PASTOR BOB>and helping people is my calling.

634
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,140
<26-3,CASTLE>那你的使命也包括帮助那些坐在你腿上
<26-3,CASTLE>Does that include helping people out of their clothes

635
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,520
<26-3,CASTLE>尽情展示胴体的人吗
<26-3,CASTLE>while they're sitting on your lap?

636
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:30,460
<26-4,PASTOR BOB>你从哪搞到的
<26-4,PASTOR BOB>Where did you get those?

637
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:32,310
<26-5,BECKETT>我看你非常清楚照片是哪来的
<26-5,BECKETT>I think you already know the answer to that.

638
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:34,500
<26-6,PASTOR BOB>看来你们也是图财的了
<26-6,PASTOR BOB>I suppose you want money, too.

639
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:37,180
<26-6,PASTOR BOB>我是个牧师  不是取款机
<26-6,PASTOR BOB>I am a pastor, not a bank!

640
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,730
<26-7,CASTLE>我们不是来讹你的
<26-7,CASTLE>We're not here to blackmail you.

641
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:40,880
<26-7,CASTLE>不是吗
<26-7,CASTLE>You're not?

642
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:44,080
<27-1,PASTOR BOB>事情始于六个月前
<27-1,PASTOR BOB>It started six months ago.

643
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:44,880
<27-1,PASTOR BOB>我当时...
<27-1,PASTOR BOB>I had...

644
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:47,590
<27-1,PASTOR BOB>一时糊涂
<27-1,PASTOR BOB>a moment of weakness.

645
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:49,880
<27-1,PASTOR BOB>被那舞女拍了个现行
<27-1,PASTOR BOB>That stripper got photos of me.

646
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:51,790
<27-1,PASTOR BOB>从此我就没安生日子过了
<27-1,PASTOR BOB>It's been a nightmare ever since.

647
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:53,910
<27-1,PASTOR BOB>今天要一千  明天要五百
<27-1,PASTOR BOB>$1,000 here, $500 there.

648
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,110
<27-2,BECKETT>也就是说讹你的是塞弗丽  不是罗根
<27-2,BECKETT>So, Sapphire was blackmailing you, not Rogan?

649
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:59,120
<27-3,PASTOR BOB>一开始他没有  但后来罗根肯定发现了
<27-3,PASTOR BOB>At first. Then Rogan must've found out.

650
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,740
<27-3,PASTOR BOB>他不知用什么办法搞到了照片
<27-3,PASTOR BOB>He got his hands on the photos somehow.

651
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,130
<27-3,PASTOR BOB>他说如果我给他两万五
<27-3,PASTOR BOB>He said if I gave him $25,000,

652
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:06,520
<27-3,PASTOR BOB>他就能彻底解决掉这些照片
<27-3,PASTOR BOB>he would make them disappear forever.

653
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:07,470
<27-3,PASTOR BOB>如果我不给钱
<27-3,PASTOR BOB>And if I didn't,

654
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:11,430
<27-3,PASTOR BOB>他就把这些照片寄给本地教会
<27-3,PASTOR BOB>he would release them to the Willow Creek register.

655
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:14,000
<27-4,CASTLE>所以为了弄回这些照片  你才绑架了他
<27-4,CASTLE>So, is that why you kidnapped him? To get those photos back?

656
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,760
<27-4,CASTLE>什么
<27-4,CASTLE>What?!

657
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,200
<27-5,PASTOR BOB>我才没有绑架他
<27-5,PASTOR BOB>I didn't kidnap him!

658
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:19,900
<27-5,PASTOR BOB>你们把我看成什么人了
<27-5,PASTOR BOB>What kind of a man do you think I am?!

659
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,300
<27-6,CASTLE>从照片上就能看出你是什么人
<27-6,CASTLE>Well, I think we have a pretty good picture.

660
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,810
<27-6,CASTLE>而且不止一张
<27-6,CASTLE>We have a few pictures, actually.

661
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:24,330
<27-7,PASTOR BOB>我都打算付钱了
<27-7,PASTOR BOB>No, I was going to pay him.

662
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:25,850
<27-7,PASTOR BOB>我发誓  不信来看
<27-7,PASTOR BOB>I swear. Look.

663
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:30,120
<27-7,PASTOR BOB>本来今天早上我准备把钱给他
<27-7,PASTOR BOB>I was supposed to meet him here this morning with the money.

664
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:34,530
<27-7,PASTOR BOB>然后他把那笔记本和照片交给我
<27-7,PASTOR BOB>He was going to hand over the laptop and the photos,

665
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:36,170
<27-7,PASTOR BOB>但他一直没来
<27-7,PASTOR BOB>but he never showed.

666
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,480
<27-8,PASTOR BOB>马上就来  门罗太太
<27-8,PASTOR BOB>Be right with you, Mrs. Monroe.

667
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:45,860
<27-9,BECKETT>所以你也不知道罗根在哪  是谁绑了他
<27-9,BECKETT>So, you have no idea where Rogan is or who might've taken him?

668
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:46,670
<27-9,BECKETT>不知道
<27-9,BECKETT>No.

669
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:51,230
<27-10,PASTOR BOB>但如果你们找着他  告诉他钱已经备好了
<27-10,PASTOR BOB>But if you find him, tell him I am ready to pay.

670
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,930
<27-10,PASTOR BOB>我只希望这破事早点了结
<27-10,PASTOR BOB>I just want this to end.

671
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:57,190
<27-10,PASTOR BOB>让您久等了  门罗太太
<27-10,PASTOR BOB>Thank you for waiting, Mrs. Monroe.

672
00:26:57,290 --> 00:27:00,610
<27-11,CASTLE>那么你老公截了别人的发财路
<27-11,CASTLE>So, your husband is hijacking someone else's blackmail?

673
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:03,800
<27-11,CASTLE>还挺聪明  也很邪恶
<27-11,CASTLE>Kind of ingenious, in a... degenerate sort of way.

674
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,180
<27-12,BECKETT>塞弗丽肯定不这么想
<27-12,BECKETT>Not if you're Sapphire.

675
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,740
<27-12,BECKETT>如果你是塞弗丽
<27-12,BECKETT>If you're Sapphire,

676
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,980
<27-12,BECKETT>来钱门道被人堵了肯定恼火
<27-12,BECKETT>you're pissed that you lost your income stream,

677
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,790
<27-12,BECKETT>会想把这些照片夺回来
<27-12,BECKETT>and you want those photos back.

678
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:13,860
<28-1,CRYSTAL>抱歉  塞弗丽走了
<28-1,CRYSTAL>I'm sorry, but Sapphire's gone.

679
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,650
<28-1,CRYSTAL>你们俩刚问完话  她就逃了
<28-1,CRYSTAL>She bolted right after she talked to you guys.

680
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,310
<28-1,CRYSTAL>臭娘们害得我替她当班
<28-1,CRYSTAL>Bitch stuck me with her shift.

681
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,610
<28-2,BECKETT>你知道能在哪找到她吗
<28-2,BECKETT>Do you know where we could find her?

682
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:22,800
<28-3,CRYSTAL>你可以去他男朋友那找找
<28-3,CRYSTAL>You could try her boyfriend's place.

683
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,280
<28-3,CRYSTAL>他们算是在同居
<28-3,CRYSTAL>They sort of live together.

684
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,020
<28-3,CRYSTAL>他名叫吉米·拉兹
<28-3,CRYSTAL>His name's Jimmy Lutz.

685
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:29,100
<28-3,CRYSTAL>他在183号公路边上有座农场
<28-3,CRYSTAL>He's got a farm off route 183.

686
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:33,390
<28-4,CASTLE>我们真该给她小费
<28-4,CASTLE>We really should tip.

687
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:43,970
<28-4,CASTLE>就是这里
<28-4,CASTLE>There it is.

688
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,210
<29-1,CASTLE>就是那辆卡车
<29-1,CASTLE>That's the truck.

689
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,790
<29-2,BECKETT>把罗根劫走的那辆
<29-2,BECKETT>The one that took Rogan.

690
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,120
<29-2,BECKETT>你看
<29-2,BECKETT>Here.

691
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:02,960
<29-3,CASTLE>看看谷仓那边
<29-3,CASTLE>Check out the barn.

692
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,380
<29-4,BECKETT>看来我们找到劫匪了
<29-4,BECKETT>Looks like we found our kidnappers.

693
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:10,520
<29-5,CASTLE>我们报警吧
<29-5,CASTLE>Then we should call the police.

694
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,580
<29-7,CASTLE>-理由是什么  -他们手里有枪
<29-7,CASTLE>- And tell them what? - That they have guns.

695
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:15,950
<29-8,BECKETT>在他们自己的地盘上持枪  受宪法保护
<29-8,BECKETT>On their own property, which is their constitutional right.

696
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,470
<29-8,BECKETT>我们没法证明他们劫了罗根
<29-8,BECKETT>We don't have proof that they have Rogan.

697
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:22,300
<29-9,CASTLE>暂时没法
<29-9,CASTLE>Yet.

698
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:24,440
<29-9,CASTLE>暂时  什么暂时
<29-9,CASTLE>"Yet"? What do you mean, "yet"?

699
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,210
<29-10,BECKETT>来吧  卡塞尔
<29-10,BECKETT>Come on, Castle.

700
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,790
<29-10,BECKETT>我们进去看看他是不是被关在那里
<29-10,BECKETT>Let's see if that's where they're keeping him.

701
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,040
<29-10,BECKETT>你明天还想不想结婚了
<29-10,BECKETT>Do you want to get married tomorrow or not?

702
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,160
<29-11,CASTLE>万一被他们抓住了呢
<29-11,CASTLE>What if we get caught?

703
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,580
<29-12,BECKETT>就说我们是城里出来玩的
<29-12,BECKETT>We tell them we're tourists from the city.

704
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:40,330
<29-12,BECKETT>走迷路了
<29-12,BECKETT>We got lost.

705
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,960
<29-13,CASTLE>是啊  这法子在电影里可管用了
<29-13,CASTLE>Yes. That worked out really well in "Deliverance."

706
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,460
<29-14,BECKETT>就先从那谷仓找起吧
<29-14,BECKETT>Okay, let's start with that barn.

707
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:57,030
<30-1,CASTLE>这地方就跟乡村恐怖片的开头似的
<30-1,CASTLE>Place looks like the start of an Amish horror film.

708
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:04,140
<30-2,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<30-2,BECKETT>Castle.

709
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:09,350
<30-2,BECKETT>罗根
<30-2,BECKETT>Rogan?

710
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:12,760
<30-3,BECKETT>是你吗
<30-3,BECKETT>Is that you?

711
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:25,250
<30-4,CASTLE>吓我一大跳
<30-4,CASTLE>I was not expecting that.

712
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,420
<30-5,BECKETT>罗根
<30-5,BECKETT>Rogan!

<30-5,BECKETT>oh, my God.

714
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:38,360
<30-6,ROGAN>笑死我了  老兄  你真该听听你那动静
<30-6,ROGAN>Oh, my God. Dude, you should've heard yourself.

715
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:39,850
<30-6,ROGAN>不要  啊啊啊
<30-6,ROGAN>"Oh! Aah!"

<30-7,ROGAN>Kit Kat, who is this guy?

717
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:45,860

<30-9,BECKETT>是吗
<30-9,BECKETT>Really?

720
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,590
<30-10,ROGAN>就冲刚才那小甜嗓
<30-10,ROGAN>Well, after his little scream,

721
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:54,890
<30-10,ROGAN>你最好检查下他的家伙事
<30-10,ROGAN>you may want to, uh, re-check his man parts.

722
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,210
<30-11,CASTLE>我的家伙事粗着呢  劳你关心了
<30-11,CASTLE>My man parts are just fine, thank you very much.

723
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:58,720
<30-12,BECKETT>咱们能不能别讨论什么家伙事了
<30-12,BECKETT>Could everyone please stop saying "man parts"?

724
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,850
<30-13,ROGAN>你们怎么找到我的
<30-13,ROGAN>So, how did you find me?

726
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,500
<30-14,CASTLE>一路闻着堕落和欺诈的臭气
<30-14,CASTLE>of disappointment and deception,

727
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,530
<30-14,CASTLE>就直接找到你了

<30-15,ROGAN>快给我解开绳子  咱们赶紧逃走
<30-15,ROGAN>Here, why don't you untie me so we can get out of here?

730
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:08,760
<30-16,BECKETT>好
<30-16,BECKETT>Fine.

731
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,660
<30-17,CASTLE>你才是混蛋
<30-17,CASTLE>You're a douche.

<30-18,ROGAN>W-what are you -- what are you doing?

734
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:18,930
<30-19,BECKETT>解开一只手就够了
<30-19,BECKETT>Freeing up one hand.

735
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:21,440
<30-19,BECKETT>签个字又不用两只手
<30-19,BECKETT>That's all you need to sign this.

736
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:23,820
<30-20,ROGAN>说得好  小凯

738
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,490
<30-21,BECKETT>我没跟你开玩笑
<30-21,BECKETT>I'm not joking.

739
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:29,220
<30-21,BECKETT>你要是想脱身逃走  那就得先签字
<30-21,BECKETT>If you want me to cut you loose, then sign the papers.

740
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,960
<30-22,ROGAN>你先让我逃出去  我再签字
<30-22,ROGAN>I'll sign the papers when we're out of here.

00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,280
<30-24,ROGAN>什么  你不相信我吗
<30-24,ROGAN>What? You don't trust me?

743
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,880
<30-25,CASTLE>你毕竟敲诈了一位牧师
<30-25,CASTLE>In fairness, you did blackmail a pastor.

744
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,660
<30-26,ROGAN>等等  就等一下
<30-26,ROGAN>Wait, wait, wait. Just hold on.

745
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,440
<30-26,ROGAN>你就不想听听我的说法吗
<30-26,ROGAN>Don't you want to hear my side of it?

746
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,050
<30-27,BECKETT>我不在乎
<30-27,BECKETT>I don't care about your side!

747
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:45,160
<30-27,BECKETT>我只要你把这文件签了
<30-27,BECKETT>I just want you to sign these papers.

748
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,910
<30-28,CASTLE>我想我们还是先等安全了
<30-28,CASTLE>You know, maybe we should wait to do this

749
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:47,950
<30-28,CASTLE>再来签字吧
<30-28,CASTLE>till we get somewhere safe.

750
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:49,660
<30-29,ROGAN>就是  听那家伙事的话
<30-29,ROGAN>Yes. Listen to man parts.

751
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:51,210
<30-29,ROGAN>我们先离开这鬼地方
<30-29,ROGAN>Let's get the hell out of here.

752
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:52,360
<30-30,BECKETT>你好再次玩失踪吗
<30-30,BECKETT>So you can disappear again?

753
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,840
<30-30,BECKETT>再被绑架吗  没门
<30-30,BECKETT>Or get kidnapped? No.

754
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:56,210
<30-30,BECKETT>现在就在虚线上把名字签了
<30-30,BECKETT>Just sign these papers right now on the dotted line.

755
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:57,450
<30-31,ROGAN>你不懂
<30-31,ROGAN>You don't understand.

756
00:30:57,670 --> 00:30:58,920
<30-31,ROGAN>这些家伙要杀了我
<30-31,ROGAN>Those guys are gonna kill me.

757
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,940
<30-32,BECKETT>就为了几张敲诈的照片
<30-32,BECKETT>Over blackmail photos?

758
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,420
<30-32,BECKETT>他们不会杀了你的  罗根
<30-32,BECKETT>They're not gonna kill you, Rogan.

759
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:04,060
<30-33,CASTLE>话说回来  这样一来我们的麻烦就解决了
<30-33,CASTLE>Though, if you think about it, that would solve our problem.

760
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,800
<30-34,ROGAN>听着  这不仅仅是关于牧师的事
<30-34,ROGAN>Listen, this isn't about the pastor, okay?

761
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,940
<30-34,ROGAN>那脱衣舞女的手机里还有其他照片
<30-34,ROGAN>T-there were other photos on t-that stripper's phone --

762
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:11,150
<30-34,ROGAN>那些照片和她男朋友有关
<30-34,ROGAN>photos that had something to do with her boyfriend.

<30-36,ROGAN>是的  但我觉得这不是他真名
<30-36,ROGAN>Yeah, but I-I don't think that's his real name.

765
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:15,810
<30-36,ROGAN>我的意思是  那对丑兄弟
<30-36,ROGAN>I mean, t-the ugly brothers --

766
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:18,080
<30-36,ROGAN>他们一直叫他别的名字
<30-36,ROGAN>they -- they always, uh, called him something else,

767
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,610
<30-36,ROGAN>好像是什么巴保兹
<30-36,ROGAN>like... Barbozza something.

<30-37,BECKETT>等等  叫巴保兹

00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:31,610
<30-40,ROGAN>但我没告诉他照片在哪
<30-40,ROGAN>but I wouldn't tell him where they are

774
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:33,470
<30-40,ROGAN>因为我不想把蒂尔迪扯进来
<30-40,ROGAN>'cause I didn't want him going after Tildy.

775
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:35,890
<30-41,CASTLE>打断下  我们是在说米奇·巴保兹
<30-41,CASTLE>I-I'm sorry -- are we talking about Mickey Barbozza,

<30-44,BECKETT>他为了躲避搜捕杀了六个人
<30-44,BECKETT>He eluded a massive manhunt by killing half a dozen people,

781
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,720
<30-44,BECKETT>联调局就一直在通缉他
<30-44,BECKETT>and the FBI's been - looking for him ever since.

782
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:52,010
<30-45,ROGAN>那  他一直躲在这里吗
<30-45,ROGAN>And, so, wh-- he's been hiding out up here?

<30-46,BECKETT>Yeah. Congratulations, Rogan.

784
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:57,290
<30-46,BECKETT>你碰巧偷了一位潜逃黑帮成员的照片
<30-46,BECKETT>You accidentally stole photos of a fugitive mobster.

785
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,950
<30-47,ROGAN>好吧  但这不是我本意
<30-47,ROGAN>Okay, but that was not my intent.

00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,560
<30-48,CASTLE>快点  我们走
<30-48,CASTLE>Come on. Let's go.

787
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:11,630
<30-49,ROGAN>只有我这么想  还是我们完蛋了
<30-49,ROGAN>Is it just me, or are we completely screwed?

788
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:18,920
<31-1,MARTHA>快点  理查德  快接电话
<31-1,MARTHA>Oh, come on, Richard. Pick up.

789
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,080
<31-2,ALEXIS>还没消息吗
<31-2,ALEXIS>Still no word?

790
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,120
<31-3,MARTHA>好几个小时没消息了
<31-3,MARTHA>No, not for hours.

791
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:23,680
<31-4,ESPOSITO>很漂亮  不是吗
<31-4,ESPOSITO>It's beautiful, isn't it?

792
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:24,430
<31-4,ESPOSITO>简直完美
<31-4,ESPOSITO>It's perfect.

793
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:27,080
<31-5,LANIE>真不敢相信阿丽克西斯和玛莎能布置好这里
<31-5,LANIE>I can't believe Alexis and Martha pulled this off.

794
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,950
<31-6,ESPOSITO>现在就缺新郎和新娘了
<31-6,ESPOSITO>Now all we need is a bride and groom.

795
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:31,780
<31-7,LANIE>离婚礼开始只有不到24小时了
<31-7,LANIE>The wedding's less than 24 hours away.

796
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,360
<31-7,LANIE>希望他们能赶到
<31-7,LANIE>I hope they make it.

797
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:42,070
<32-1,BECKETT>告诉我这也是童话的一部分吧
<32-1,BECKETT>Tell me this is - still part of the fairy tale.

798
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:43,910
<32-2,CASTLE>如果是  那也是格林暗黑童话
<32-2,CASTLE>If it is, it's a Grimm one.

799
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:46,510
<32-3,ROGAN>你们觉得他们会怎么做
<32-3,ROGAN>What do you -- what do you think they're gonna do?

800
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:48,650
<32-4,BECKETT>我觉得
<32-4,BECKETT>My guess --

801
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:51,450
<32-4,BECKETT>一旦他们拿回照片  他们就会杀了我们
<32-4,BECKETT>once they recover the photos, they'll probably kill us.

802
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:54,410
<32-5,CASTLE>是啊  成就史上最糟单身派对
<32-5,CASTLE>Yes, making this - the worst bachelor party ever!

803
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:55,480
<32-6,ROGAN>别看我啊
<32-6,ROGAN>Don't look at me.

804
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,680
<32-6,ROGAN>要不是她那么固执不肯给我松绑
<32-6,ROGAN>Okay, we would've been out of there

805
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:59,190
<32-6,ROGAN>我们早就逃出去了
<32-6,ROGAN>if she hadn't gotten all stubborn and just cut me loose.

806
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:02,260
<32-7,BECKETT>你大可以签了文件  让我解脱啊
<32-7,BECKETT>You could've just signed those papers and cut me loose.

807
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,450
<32-8,ROGAN>不管你信不信
<32-8,ROGAN>Hey, believe it or not,

808
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:05,940
<32-8,ROGAN>我只是想补偿蒂尔迪
<32-8,ROGAN>I was just trying to do the right thing for Tildy.

809
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,870
<32-9,BECKETT>靠敲诈一位牧师吗
<32-9,BECKETT>By blackmailing a pastor?

810
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:10,220
<32-10,ROGAN>拜托  别被那牧师骗了
<32-10,ROGAN>Oh, please. Don't let the collar fool you.

811
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,540
<32-10,ROGAN>他活该
<32-10,ROGAN>That guy had it coming.

812
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:13,700
<32-11,CASTLE>不会吧  你说牧师活该
<32-11,CASTLE>Really?! The pastor had it coming?

813
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:17,120
<32-12,ROGAN>没错  他告诉我了一个投资机会
<32-12,ROGAN>Yes. He told me about this investment opportunity

814
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,510
<32-12,ROGAN>可以让我的钱翻一番
<32-12,ROGAN>where I could double my money.

815
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:22,670
<32-12,ROGAN>只是  我没钱  所以我问蒂尔迪借了
<32-12,ROGAN>Only...I didn't have any money, so I borrowed tildy's.

816
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:25,030
<32-12,ROGAN>猜猜发生了什么  那就是个骗局
<32-12,ROGAN>Well, guess what. It was a scam.

817
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,210
<32-12,ROGAN>那人骗我好付钱给那个脱衣舞女
<32-12,ROGAN>The guy was rooking me to pay off the stripper.

818
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:29,390
<32-12,ROGAN>这破了多少戒律啊
<32-12,ROGAN>I mean, how many broken commandments is that?

819
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,220
<32-12,ROGAN>所以我就自己扛下来了
<32-12,ROGAN>So I took matters into my own hands, you know?

820
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:34,960
<32-12,ROGAN>那可真他妈的是个好计划
<32-12,ROGAN>And it was a -- it was a damn fine plan, too.

821
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,550
<32-13,ROGAN>除了...
<32-13,ROGAN>Except the...

823
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,050
<32-13,ROGAN>我真没想到会变成这样
<32-13,ROGAN>I really didn't see that coming.

824
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,430
<32-13,ROGAN>我们还没完
<32-13,ROGAN>This isn't over.
