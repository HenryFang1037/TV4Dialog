1
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:09,540
<1-1,TOM RICHWOOD>执行了六个月的任务
<1-1,TOM RICHWOOD>You know, after six months,

2
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,610
<1-1,TOM RICHWOOD>火星越看越像考艾岛了
<1-1,TOM RICHWOOD>Mars is starting to remind me of Kauai,

3
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:15,380
<1-1,TOM RICHWOOD>只不过没有水
<1-1,TOM RICHWOOD>Except without the water

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,450
<1-1,TOM RICHWOOD>也没有穿泳衣的美女  也没有空气
<1-1,TOM RICHWOOD>or the hot girls in bikinis or the air.

5
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,270
<1-1,TOM RICHWOOD>我真想看看美女啊
<1-1,TOM RICHWOOD>What I wouldn't give for a hot girl.

6
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:28,210
<1-1,TOM RICHWOOD>都这么久了  看个丑女也行
<1-1,TOM RICHWOOD>Hell, after all this time, I'd even take an ugly one,

7
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:30,630
<1-1,TOM RICHWOOD>如果她装在纸袋里
<1-1,TOM RICHWOOD>Assuming she came with a paper bag.

8
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:33,020
<1-2,ELISE KIM>真会说话  里奇伍德
<1-2,ELISE KIM>Oh, real classy, Richwood.

9
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:34,450
<1-2,ELISE KIM>赶紧修好短路
<1-2,ELISE KIM>Just repair the short,

10
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,880
<1-2,ELISE KIM>确保4B线圈没有烧坏
<1-2,ELISE KIM>and make sure the four-b coil isn't fried.

11
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,780
<1-2,ELISE KIM>电力网不能坏掉
<1-2,ELISE KIM>We can't afford to have the power grid compromised.

12
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,510
<1-3,TOM>是  舰长
<1-3,TOM>Aye-aye, captain.

13
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:45,660
<1-4,TOM>糟糕
<1-4,TOM>Oh, boy.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,120
<1-4,TOM>坏消息  烧坏了
<1-4,TOM>Bad news. It's charred.

15
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:52,340
<1-4,TOM>我可能得换掉动力耦合器了
<1-4,TOM>I may have to replace the power coupling

16
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:54,550
<1-4,TOM>并重启A级系统
<1-4,TOM>and reboot A-level systems...

17
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,400
<1-5,KIM>没收到  里奇伍德  有干扰
<1-5,KIM>Didn't read that, Richwood. Interference.

18
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,630
<1-5,KIM>重复
<1-5,KIM>Come again.

20
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,280
<1-6,TOM>小心
<1-6,TOM>Watch out!

21
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,500
<1-7,KIM>汤姆
<1-7,KIM>Tom?

23
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:06,010
<1-7,KIM>汤姆
<1-7,KIM>Tom!

26
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:25,240
<2-1,ALEXIS CASTLE>好诶
<2-1,ALEXIS CASTLE>Yes!

27
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,250
<2-2,KATE BECKETT>我等不及脱下我的...
<2-2,KATE BECKETT>I can't wait to take off my...

28
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,490
<2-2,KATE BECKETT>鞋了
<2-2,KATE BECKETT>...shoes.

29
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:30,850
<2-3,ALEXIS>爸爸  贝克特
<2-3,ALEXIS>Dad. Beckett.

30
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:32,270
<2-4,RICHARD CASTLE>看来别想安静在家度过一晚了
<2-4,RICHARD CASTLE>So much for a quiet evening at home.

31
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:34,760
<2-5,ALEXIS>我以为你们今晚要工作到很晚
<2-5,ALEXIS>I thought you guys were working late tonight.

32
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,130
<2-6,CASTLE>今天没什么案子  我们早下班了
<2-6,CASTLE>Slow murder day. We got off early.

33
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:37,740
<2-6,CASTLE>你在玩激光枪战
<2-6,CASTLE>You're playing laser tag?

34
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,480
<2-6,CASTLE>不带我
<2-6,CASTLE>Without me?

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,010
<2-7,CASTLE>那是我的装备吗
<2-7,CASTLE>Is that my gear?

36
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:43,580
<2-8,ALEXIS>爸爸  贝克特  这是大卫
<2-8,ALEXIS>Oh, dad, Beckett, this is David.

37
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,570
<2-8,ALEXIS>他跟我打赌说我打不过他
<2-8,ALEXIS>He bet me I couldn't beat him.

38
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,940
<2-9,BECKETT>-她把你海扁了  是吧  -是啊
<2-9,BECKETT>- She trounced you, didn't she? - Yeah.

39
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,090
<2-10,DAVID>天呐
<2-10,DAVID>Oh, my,

40
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:51,800
<2-11,MARTHA RODGERS>这下面是怎么回事
<2-11,MARTHA RODGERS>What is going on down here?

41
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:55,880
<2-12,CASTLE>显然发生的事太多了  那是我的睡衣吗
<2-12,CASTLE>Far too much, apparently. Uh, are those my pajamas?

42
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,330
<2-13,MARTHA>真抱歉  本
<2-13,MARTHA>I'm so sorry, Ben.

43
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,960
<2-13,MARTHA>我的家人  这是本杰明
<2-13,MARTHA>Um, family, Benjamin.

44
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,600
<2-13,MARTHA>本  这是我的家人
<2-13,MARTHA>Ben, meet my family.

45
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,120
<2-14,BECKETT>卡塞尔  有杀人案
<2-14,BECKETT>Castle, we got a murder.

46
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,690
<2-15,BECKETT>要破  不是要犯下
<2-15,BECKETT>Uh, to solve, not to commit.

47
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:09,990
<2-16,MARTHA>再见
<2-16,MARTHA>Bye.

48
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,840
<3-1,CASTLE>那是我最软的一件睡衣了
<3-1,CASTLE>But those were my softest pajamas,

49
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,790
<3-1,CASTLE>现在我只能烧掉了
<3-1,CASTLE>and now I'm gonna have to burn them.

50
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:14,940
<3-1,CASTLE>只有我觉得
<3-1,CASTLE>Is it just me, or is the loft

51
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,170
<3-1,CASTLE>家里现在越来越挤了吗
<3-1,CASTLE>getting awfully small these days?

52
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,390
<3-2,BECKETT>四个大人住在一起
<3-2,BECKETT>Well, four adults together in one space...

53
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,480
<3-2,BECKETT>我们肯定要妨碍到彼此
<3-2,BECKETT>We're bound to step on each other's toes.

54
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,650
<3-3,CASTLE>今晚的人格外多
<3-3,CASTLE>Yeah, well, there's a lot more toes than usual tonight.

55
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,330
<3-4,KEVIN RYAN>伙计们  你们能来太好了
<3-4,KEVIN RYAN>Hey, guys. Glad you're here.

56
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:27,200
<3-4,KEVIN RYAN>你们肯定想看看的  尤其你  卡塞尔
<3-4,KEVIN RYAN>You're gonna want to see this, especially you, Castle.

57
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,350
<3-4,KEVIN RYAN>这是什么地方啊
<3-4,KEVIN RYAN>What is this place?

58
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:37,680
<4-1,BECKETT>是任务控制中心
<4-1,BECKETT>It's mission control.

59
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,490
<4-2,CASTLE>那是火星
<4-2,CASTLE>And that's Mars.

60
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,590
<4-3,RYAN>那是尸体
<4-3,RYAN>And there's your body.

61
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:47,850
<4-4,CASTLE>被害人在火星
<4-4,CASTLE>Our victim is on Mars?

62
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,480
<4-4,CASTLE>秘密火星任务的谣言是真的
<4-4,CASTLE>The "Secret manned mission to Mars" rumors were true.

63
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,590
<4-4,CASTLE>我就知道
<4-4,CASTLE>I knew it!

64
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:54,570
<4-5,BECKETT>这是不是超出我们的管辖范围了
<4-5,BECKETT>You know, this might be a little out of our jurisdiction.

65
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:55,600
<4-6,JAVIER ESPOSITO>那不是火星
<4-6,JAVIER ESPOSITO>It's not Mars.

66
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,150
<4-6,JAVIER ESPOSITO>这位是行动指挥艾德·莱德利
<4-6,JAVIER ESPOSITO>This is operations director Ed Redley.

67
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,320
<4-6,JAVIER ESPOSITO>-这是贝克特和莱恩警探  -卡塞尔
<4-6,JAVIER ESPOSITO>- This is detectives Beckett and Ryan. - Castle.

68
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,560
<4-8,ED REDLEY>你们所看到的是
<4-8,ED REDLEY>Uh, what you're seeing is a live feed

69
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,030
<4-8,ED REDLEY>真正火星任务之前的
<4-8,ED REDLEY>from a simulation we're conducting

70
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,840
<4-8,ED REDLEY>模拟任务直播信号
<4-8,ED REDLEY>in advance of a real Mars mission.

71
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:06,250
<4-9,BECKETT>你们是哪方面  宇航局吗
<4-9,BECKETT>Who's "We"? NASA?

72
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:09,230
<4-10,ED>这是火星2018任务  由个人资助
<4-10,ED>It's the Mars 2018 project. We're privately funded.

73
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:12,050
<4-11,CASTLE>没错  韦格·詹森  那个网络亿万富翁
<4-11,CASTLE>Yes, by Viggo Jansen, the internet billionaire.

74
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:14,590
<4-11,CASTLE>他许诺2018年要送人上火星
<4-11,CASTLE>He promised to put humans on Mars by 2018.

75
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,960
<4-11,CASTLE>还办了比赛
<4-11,CASTLE>Held a competition and everything.

76
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,250
<4-11,CASTLE>我报名加入项目  但没进去
<4-11,CASTLE>I signed up for the program, but I didn't get in.

77
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,090
<4-12,BECKETT>你报名去火星
<4-12,BECKETT>Wait, you signed up to go to Mars?

78
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:21,780
<4-13,CASTLE>-什么时候  -几年前
<4-13,CASTLE>- When? - A couple years ago.

79
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,260
<4-14,BECKETT>我当时在哪
<4-14,BECKETT>Where was I?

80
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:24,910
<4-15,CASTLE>我们当时在吵架
<4-15,CASTLE>We were fighting.

81
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:28,430
<4-16,ESPOSITO>被害人  驾驶员汤姆·里奇伍德被该是
<4-16,ESPOSITO>The victim, pilot Tom Richwood, was supposedly alone

82
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:31,850
<4-16,ESPOSITO>独自一人在火星表面进行维修任务
<4-16,ESPOSITO>on the, uh, planet's surface conducting repairs.

83
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:33,440
<4-17,ED>我们当时遭遇了通讯中断
<4-17,ED>We were in a communication blackout,

84
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,330
<4-17,ED>这是模拟状态的一部分
<4-17,ED>part of simulating planetary conditions,

85
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:36,930
<4-17,ED>这时任务指挥官打破规程
<4-17,ED>when the mission commander broke protocol

86
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,460
<4-17,ED>跟我们说汤姆死了
<4-17,ED>to tell us they found Tom dead.

87
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,130
<4-17,ED>他们认为并非意外
<4-17,ED>They don't think it was an accident.

88
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:42,550
<4-18,BECKETT>我想看看尸体  模拟地在哪
<4-18,BECKETT>Well, I'd like to see the body. So where is the simulation?

89
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:43,740
<4-19,ED>在楼下
<4-19,ED>A couple of floors below us,

90
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,300
<4-19,ED>这说来容易做起来难
<4-19,ED>and that's easier said than done.

91
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,950
<4-20,RYAN>为了模拟火星环境
<4-20,RYAN>In order to mimic conditions on Mars

92
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,750
<4-20,RYAN>也避免作弊
<4-20,RYAN>as well as discourage any cheating,

93
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,890
<4-20,RYAN>模拟室里满是毒气
<4-20,RYAN>the simulation is filled with noxious gas.

94
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:51,740
<4-20,RYAN>不会致死
<4-20,RYAN>Right, it won't kill you,

95
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:54,380
<4-21,ED>但会引起严重不适和红疹
<4-21,ED>but it will induce severe nausea and a rash.

96
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,160
<4-21,ED>要好几天才能排净模拟室的空气
<4-21,ED>It would take several days to vent the sim

97
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,520
<4-21,ED>让里面气体可呼吸  所以你们如果想进去
<4-21,ED>to make the air breathable, so if you want to go in,

98
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,550
<4-21,ED>就得穿太空服
<4-21,ED>you're gonna need to wear space suits.

99
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,260
<4-22,CASTLE>最棒的案子
<4-22,CASTLE>Best case ever!

100
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,820
<4-22,CASTLE>这边吗
<4-22,CASTLE>This way?

101
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,880
<5-1,BECKETT>能跟我们讲讲被害人吗
<5-1,BECKETT>What can you tell us about the victim?

102
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,860
<5-2,ED>汤姆·里奇伍德是任务的驾驶员
<5-2,ED>Well, Tom Richwood was the mission pilot.

103
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,310
<5-2,ED>前海军飞行员  在宇航局上过天
<5-2,ED>Former navy top gun, did a tour with NASA.

104
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,200
<5-3,BECKETT>家人呢
<5-3,BECKETT>What about family?

105
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:20,330
<5-4,ED>没有  所以他是任务首选人物
<5-4,ED>None, which made him the perfect candidate for the mission.

106
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:21,750
<5-4,ED>他击败了世界上一些
<5-4,ED>He beat out some of the smartest,

107
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,420
<5-4,ED>最聪明  最有竞争力的候选人
<5-4,ED>most competitive candidates in the world

108
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,680
<5-4,ED>加入了这项首个人类上火星的任务
<5-4,ED>to be a part of the first manned team to Mars.

109
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,350
<5-5,CASTLE>-他们都是这样  -里面还有谁
<5-5,CASTLE>- They all did. - Who else is inside?

110
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,060
<5-6,ED>剩余四位宇航员
<5-6,ED>Our four remaining astronauts.

111
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:32,120
<5-6,ED>团队医疗专家哈伦博士在等你
<5-6,ED>The team's medical specialist, Dr. Haroun, is waiting for you.

112
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,880
<6-1,BECKETT>最近有人进出过模拟室吗
<6-1,BECKETT>So, has anyone been in or out of the simulation recently?

113
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:41,040
<6-2,ED>不  这是一项全密封9个月的实验
<6-2,ED>No. It's a sealed nine-month experiment.

114
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,160
<6-1,BECKETT>宇航员六个月前
<6-1,BECKETT>No one's been in or out

115
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:44,140
<6-2,ED>进入后就没有人进出过
<6-2,ED>since the astronauts entered six months ago.

116
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,630
<6-3,ESPOSITO>-那么凶手可能就在他们之中  -嗯
<6-3,ESPOSITO>- Which means one of them probably did it. - Yeah.

117
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,210
<6-5,CASTLE>只有三套宇航服
<6-5,CASTLE>There's only three suits.

118
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,540
<6-6,RYAN>没事  我们不用都进去
<6-6,RYAN>Um, that's okay. We don't all need to go in.

119
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:56,470
<6-6,RYAN>-我回大堂去录口供  -不是吧
<6-6,RYAN>- I'll go take statements back at the facility. - Seriously?

120
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,260
<6-7,CASTLE>你不想上火星吗
<6-7,CASTLE>You don't want to go to Mars?

121
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,770
<6-8,RYAN>其一  那不是火星
<6-8,RYAN>"A," It's actually not Mars,

122
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:02,650
<6-8,RYAN>其二  我在地球就很开心
<6-8,RYAN>and "B," I'm happy here on earth,

123
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:03,890
<6-8,RYAN>你好好玩吧  卡塞尔
<6-8,RYAN>but have fun, Castle.

124
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,170
<6-9,CASTLE>我一定会的
<6-9,CASTLE>Trust me, I will.

125
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,560
<7-1,BECKETT>闹完了吗
<7-1,BECKETT>Are you done?

126
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,630
<7-1,BECKETT>没有
<7-1,BECKETT>No.

127
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,400
<7-2,CASTLE>终于来到了火星
<7-2,CASTLE>Finally made it to Mars.

128
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,220
<7-2,CASTLE>我都不用进行宇航员训练
<7-2,CASTLE>I didn't even have to go to astronaut training.

129
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,980
<7-3,ESPOSITO>你真报名去火星了啊
<7-3,ESPOSITO>So, you really signed up to go to Mars, huh?

130
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:36,900
<7-4,CASTLE>那多酷啊
<7-4,CASTLE>Wouldn't that be cool?

131
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,870
<7-4,CASTLE>对你不算  但对我多酷啊
<7-4,CASTLE>I mean, not so much for you, but for me.

132
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:40,000
<7-4,CASTLE>警探
<7-4,CASTLE>Detectives?

133
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,830
<7-5,BECKETT>我是拉什曼·哈伦博士  生物科学官
<7-5,BECKETT>I'm Dr. Rusham Haroun, the bioscience officer

134
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:43,970
<7-6,BECKETT>他在那边
<7-6,BECKETT>He's over here.

135
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:47,010
<7-6,BECKETT>没人看到事情经过吗
<7-6,BECKETT>And nobody saw this happen?

136
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,960
<7-7,HAROUM>没有  我们都在模拟舱内
<7-7,HAROUM>No, we were all in the module.

137
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,610
<7-7,HAROUM>我们听到了他尖叫
<7-7,HAROUM>We heard him scream.

138
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:52,690
<7-7,HAROUM>他一定是摔在了耦合器线圈上
<7-7,HAROUM>He must have fallen into the coupling coil,

139
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:54,540
<7-7,HAROUM>因为那时电力中断了
<7-7,HAROUM>because right then the power went out.

140
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:57,590
<7-7,HAROUM>等我和安琪拉出来的时候  他已经死了
<7-7,HAROUM>By the time Angela and I got out here, he was gone.

141
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:00,120
<7-7,HAROUM>我们又花了10分钟才恢复了电力
<7-7,HAROUM>It took us another 10 minutes to get the power restored.

142
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,380
<7-8,BECKETT>看似是刀伤
<7-8,BECKETT>It looks like a stab wound.

143
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,050
<7-9,ESPOSITO>而且用力很猛
<7-9,ESPOSITO>Delivered with a lot of force.

144
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:04,280
<7-10,CASTLE>那凶器呢
<7-10,CASTLE>Well, where's the murder weapon?

145
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,200
<7-10,CASTLE>没有
<7-10,CASTLE>There wasn't one.

146
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,120
<7-11,HAROUM>但他的一件工具  他的螺丝刀不见了
<7-11,HAROUM>But one of his tools, his screwdriver, is missing.

147
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:10,160
<7-11,HAROUM>这个样子的
<7-11,HAROUM>It looks like this.

148
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,310
<7-12,ESPOSITO>这里石头很多  没有脚印
<7-12,ESPOSITO>It's pretty rocky around here. No footprints.

149
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:16,640
<7-13,CASTLE>而且凶手大概穿着宇航服
<7-13,CASTLE>And, since the killer was probably wearing a suit,

150
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,320
<7-13,CASTLE>也不会留下DNA
<7-13,CASTLE>there's not gonna be any DNA.

151
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,280
<7-14,BECKETT>把尸体送去停尸间查查看吧
<7-14,BECKETT>Let's get his body to the morgue and find out.

152
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,800
<7-14,BECKETT>让鉴证组过来  把这里好好搜索一下
<7-14,BECKETT>And get CSU down here. I want this place searched.

153
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,130
<7-14,BECKETT>如果没人进出过
<7-14,BECKETT>If no one's been in or out,

154
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:26,540
<7-14,BECKETT>那么凶器就还在这里
<7-14,BECKETT>Then that murder weapon is still inside here.

155
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:30,410
<7-14,BECKETT>哈伦博士  我想跟其他宇航员谈谈
<7-14,BECKETT>Dr. Haroun, I'd like to speak to the other astronauts, please.

156
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:32,240
<7-15,HAROUM>他们在里面  跟我来
<7-15,HAROUM>They're inside. Follow me.

157
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:37,030
<7-16,CASTLE>人类的一宗小小谋杀案
<7-16,CASTLE>One small murder for man,

158
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,980
<7-16,CASTLE>人类的一个大谜题
<7-16,CASTLE>one giant mystery for mankind.

159
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:44,120
<7-17,BECKETT>就算你低声说  大家也都能听到
<7-17,BECKETT>Even when you whisper, everyone can hear you.

160
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:54,770
<7-17,BECKETT>我可能得换掉动力耦合器了  并重启
<7-17,BECKETT>I may need to replace the power coupling and reboot...

161
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,900
<7-17,BECKETT>没收到  里奇伍德  有干扰
<7-17,BECKETT>Didn't read that, Richwood. Interference.

162
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,010
<7-17,BECKETT>重复
<7-17,BECKETT>Come again.

163
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,240
<7-17,BECKETT>小心
<7-17,BECKETT>Watch out!

164
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:04,530
<8-1,KIM>其他你们都知道了
<8-1,KIM>You know the rest.

165
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,700
<8-2,BECKETT>这事发生时你们都在哪
<8-2,BECKETT>And where were each one of you when this happened?

166
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:10,740
<8-3,KIM>安琪拉  拉什曼和我都在指挥模拟器里
<8-3,KIM>Angela, Rusham, and I were here, in the command module.

167
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,370
<8-3,KIM>米哈伊尔在工程区
<8-3,KIM>Mikhail was over in engineering.

168
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:14,550
<8-4,BECKETT>从工程区能进入外部吗
<8-4,BECKETT>And is there access to the outside from engineering?

169
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,080
<8-5,MIKHAIL>有一个紧急舱门
<8-5,MIKHAIL>There is emergency hatch,

170
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:19,510
<8-5,MIKHAIL>但如果我穿过舱门  警报会触响的
<8-5,MIKHAIL>but if I had gone through it, the alarm would have sounded.

171
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:22,160
<8-6,KIM>而且作为项目的一部分  我们都受到严密监视
<8-6,KIM>Plus, as part of the program, we're all closely monitored.

172
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,590
<8-6,KIM>以防我们丧失意识
<8-6,KIM>In case we lose consciousness

173
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:25,740
<8-6,KIM>或者宇航员出舱的时候宇航服发生故障
<8-6,KIM>or there's a suit malfunction on an E.V.A.,

174
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,110
<8-6,KIM>我们皮肤里都有追踪器
<8-6,KIM>we all have trackers under our skin.

175
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:30,700
<8-7,HAROUM>米拉会记录我们所有人的行动
<8-7,HAROUM>And M.I.R.A. keeps a record of all our movements.

176
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,650
<8-7,HAROUM>米拉是谁
<8-7,HAROUM>Who's M.I.R.A.?

177
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,500
<8-9,ANGELA>任务电脑
<8-9,ANGELA>That's what we call the mission computer.

178
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,290
<8-10,BECKETT>我想看看这些记录
<8-10,BECKETT>Well, I'd like to take a look at those records.

179
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:39,440
<8-11,MIRA>我乐意为您提供您需要的一切记录
<8-11,MIRA>I will be happy to provide you with any records you require,

180
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,670
<8-11,MIRA>贝克特探长
<8-11,MIRA>Detective Beckett.

181
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,420
<8-12,BECKETT>-她会说话  -嗯
<8-12,BECKETT>- It talks? - Yeah.

182
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,950
<8-13,KIM>我们把她视为任务的第六位成员
<8-13,KIM>We think of her as the sixth member of the crew.

183
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,540
<8-14,CASTLE>这是不是有点《2001太空漫游》
<8-14,CASTLE>Isn't that a little "2001"?

184
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,840
<8-15,HAROUM>她的程序是学习适应型的
<8-15,HAROUM>She is programmed to learn and adapt,

185
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,140
<8-15,HAROUM>但比起哈尔[电影里的机器人]  她更像siri
<8-15,HAROUM>but she's more siri than H.A.L.

186
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,400
<8-15,HAROUM>问她你在哪
<8-15,HAROUM>Ask her where you are.

187
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,510
<8-16,CASTLE>米拉  我们在哪
<8-16,CASTLE>M.I.R.A., where are we?

188
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:58,080
<8-17,MIRA>你在火星北部低地的
<8-17,MIRA>You are aboard the vessel Tensing Norgay

189
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,340
<8-17,MIRA>丹增·诺盖号
<8-17,MIRA>in the northern lowlands of Mars.

190
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:03,010
<8-18,MIKHAIL>她真以为自己在火星
<8-18,MIKHAIL>She actually thinks she's on Mars.

191
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:05,190
<8-19,BECKETT>不论如何  我得请你们
<8-19,BECKETT>Regardless, I'm gonna need to ask all of you

192
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:08,360
<8-19,BECKETT>跟我去一趟分局  我好妥当进行审问
<8-19,BECKETT>to join me at the precinct so I can interview you properly.

193
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,440
<8-20,KIM>这是个问题
<8-20,KIM>That...could be a problem.

194
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,190
<8-20,KIM>抱歉  探长
<8-20,KIM>I'm sorry, detective.

195
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,970
<9-1,ED>我不能让你带走宇航员
<9-1,ED>I can't let you remove the astronauts.

196
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:18,450
<9-1,ED>我没这个权力
<9-1,ED>I don't have that kind of authority.

197
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:19,350
<9-2,BECKETT>那谁有
<9-2,BECKETT>Well, then, who does?

198
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:21,190
<9-3,VIGGO JANSEN>我
<9-3,VIGGO JANSEN>That would be me.

199
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,710
<9-3,VIGGO JANSEN>我的宇航员哪里也不会去
<9-3,VIGGO JANSEN>And my astronauts aren't going anywhere.

200
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:27,230
<9-4,CASTLE>那是韦格·詹森啊
<9-4,CASTLE>That's Viggo Jansen. The Viggo Jansen.

201
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:29,290
<9-5,JANSEN>探长  如果我们现在停工
<9-5,JANSEN>Detective, if we shut down now,

202
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:31,150
<9-5,JANSEN>我们会失去数月的宝贵数据
<9-5,JANSEN>we will lose months of priceless data.

203
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:33,850
<9-5,JANSEN>数百万的实验就此白费
<9-5,JANSEN>Millions of dollars' worth of experiments will be compromised.

204
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:36,840
<9-5,JANSEN>我们会损失半年  我们没那个时间了
<9-5,JANSEN>We'll lose half a year, and we don't have that time.

205
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,700
<9-6,BECKETT>詹森先生  这不是请求
<9-6,BECKETT>Mr. Jansen, it's not a request.

206
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,580
<9-6,BECKETT>有人被杀了
<9-6,BECKETT>A man has been murdered.

207
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,290
<9-6,BECKETT>我需要进行调查
<9-6,BECKETT>I need to conduct an investigation.

208
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:45,280
<9-7,JANSEN>我会尽全力协助你的
<9-7,JANSEN>And I will do everything in my power to help you...

209
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,670
<9-7,JANSEN>但不能关闭我的模拟室
<9-7,JANSEN>Short of shutting down my sim.

210
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:51,790
<9-8,JANSEN>火星是我们这一代的太空竞赛
<9-8,JANSEN>Mars is our generation's space race,

211
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:54,050
<9-8,JANSEN>我的团队会是第一支上火星的团队
<9-8,JANSEN>And my team's gonna be first...

212
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:55,810
<9-8,JANSEN>不是中国人  或火星一号
<9-8,JANSEN>Not the chinese or Mars one

213
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:59,930
<9-8,JANSEN>或是那个自我膨胀的电影制片人  伊恩·拉什尔爵士
<9-8,JANSEN>or that puffed-up movie producer, sir Ian Rasher.

214
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:02,660
<9-9,BECKETT>我可以申请法院命令强迫你
<9-9,BECKETT>I can get a court order to compel you.

215
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:05,050
<9-10,JANSEN>凭我的法律团队  你要花上几个月了
<9-10,JANSEN>And with my legal team, it'll take you months.

216
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:06,990
<9-10,JANSEN>或者  我们可以合作
<9-10,JANSEN>Or we can work together.

217
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,750
<9-10,JANSEN>我给你所有你需要的权限
<9-10,JANSEN>I give you all the access you need,

218
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,760
<9-10,JANSEN>让我的模拟室继续运行
<9-10,JANSEN>and my simulation keeps running.

219
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,250
<9-11,BECKET>好吧  现在可以
<9-11,BECKET>Fine. For now.

220
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,950
<9-11,BECKET>但如果被我发现那几个人中有人是凶手
<9-11,BECKET>But if I find out any of those people are responsible,

221
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:18,920
<9-11,BECKET>你休想阻止我带走他们
<9-11,BECKET>you won't stop me from removing them.

222
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,750
<9-12,RYAN>那个  根据这份追踪数据
<9-12,RYAN>Yeah. Well, according to this tracking data,

223
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,150
<9-12,RYAN>他们似乎都不是凶手
<9-12,RYAN>none of them seem responsible.

224
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,420
<9-12,RYAN>汤姆估计死亡时间时
<9-12,RYAN>They were all exactly where they said they were

225
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:27,310
<9-12,RYAN>他们都在自己所说的位置
<9-12,RYAN>at Tom's approximate time of death.

226
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,050
<9-12,RYAN>甚至确认了任务探测车
<9-12,RYAN>It even confirms that the mission's rover

227
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:32,520
<9-12,RYAN>在凶案发生时仍停在太空栖息地
<9-12,RYAN>was still parked at the habitat at the time of the incident.

228
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,440
<9-13,CASTLE>看来我的"机器反攻"理论行不通了
<9-13,CASTLE>Well, there goes my "Rise of the machines" theory.

229
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,700
<9-14,BECKETT>如果里面的人都查实了
<9-14,BECKETT>Okay, so if all the people inside are accounted for,

230
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,100
<9-14,BECKETT>那凶手一定来自模拟室外
<9-14,BECKETT>then our killer must have come from outside of the simulation.

231
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,170
<9-15,JANSEN>那我们会知道的
<9-15,JANSEN>We would know.

232
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:42,130
<9-15,JANSEN>气闸门是唯一的入口
<9-15,JANSEN>The airlock door is the only way in or out.

233
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:43,530
<9-15,JANSEN>有警报  有监控
<9-15,JANSEN>It's alarmed and monitored.

234
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:45,510
<9-16,ED>打扰  贝克特探长
<9-16,ED>Uh, excuse me. Detective Beckett,

235
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,410
<9-16,ED>栖息地内有发给你的讯息
<9-16,ED>there's a message coming in for you from the habitat.

236
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:49,020
<9-16,ED>如果可以  我放在屏幕上
<9-16,ED>I can put it on the monitor if you like.

237
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,250
<9-17,BECKETT>好的
<9-17,BECKETT>Yeah, please.

238
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:53,810
<9-18,BECKETT>埃斯波  有什么发现
<9-18,BECKETT>Hey, Espo, what do you got?

239
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:55,430
<9-19,ESPOSITO>我正在检查被害人的视频日志
<9-19,ESPOSITO>I was just going through our victim's video diaries.

240
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:56,990
<9-19,ESPOSITO>你得看看这个
<9-19,ESPOSITO>There's something you need to see.

242
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,790
<9-19,ESPOSITO>六个月了
<9-19,ESPOSITO>Six months in,

243
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:03,980
<9-20,TOM>我知道心理实验也是任务的一部分
<9-20,TOM>and I know part of this mission is a psych experiment.

244
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,150
<9-20,TOM>或许封闭的环境开始影响到我了
<9-20,TOM>Maybe the close quarters are starting to get to me,

245
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:10,150
<9-20,TOM>但我好像开始看到幻象
<9-20,TOM>but I think I'm starting to see things.

246
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:14,020
<9-20,TOM>我今天在外面时  我发誓我看到了人
<9-20,TOM>When I was out there today, I could've sworn I saw someone,

247
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,140
<9-20,TOM>而且这不是第一次了
<9-20,TOM>and it's not the first time.

248
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:22,450
<9-20,TOM>我知道这不可能  但我觉得这里并不只有我们
<9-20,TOM>I know it's not possible, but I don't think we're alone.

258
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:35,260
<10-1,ESPOSITO>别走动  我可能还有问题
<10-1,ESPOSITO>Hang tight. I may have more questions.

259
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,210
<10-2,BECKETT>讲吧  埃斯波
<10-2,BECKETT>Go ahead, Espo.

260
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:54,570
<10-3,ESPOSITO>我刚刚跟其他几位宇航员谈过
<10-3,ESPOSITO>Hey. So, I just finished talking to the other astronauts.

261
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:57,130
<10-3,ESPOSITO>他们似乎都不知道汤姆在说什么
<10-3,ESPOSITO>None of them seem to have any idea what Tom was talking about.

262
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:59,200
<10-4,BECKETT>好了  谢谢  埃斯波
<10-4,BECKETT>All right. Thanks, Espo.

263
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:01,100
<10-4,BECKETT>鉴证组刚刚完成了初步检查
<10-4,BECKETT>CSU just finished their initial sweep.

264
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:03,250
<11-1,RYAN>模拟室里没有别人
<11-1,RYAN>There's no one else in that simulation.

265
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:05,770
<11-2,JANSEN>汤姆可能真是看到幻象了
<11-2,JANSEN>It's possible Tom was seeing things.

266
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,270
<11-2,JANSEN>我们的所有测试均显示
<11-2,JANSEN>All our tests show that being locked

267
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:10,340
<11-2,JANSEN>与他人一起关在封闭空间里会对人的心理造成影响
<11-2,JANSEN>in a confined space with others can play tricks on your mind.

268
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:11,990
<11-3,CASTLE>但幻觉不会杀人
<11-3,CASTLE>Only, delusions don't kill.

269
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,720
<11-4,BECKETT>而且  如果汤姆所言属实
<11-4,BECKETT>And, if what Tom said was true,

270
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:15,000
<11-4,BECKETT>那么杀他的人
<11-4,BECKETT>then whoever killed him

271
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:17,310
<11-4,BECKETT>或许能不被察觉地进出模拟室
<11-4,BECKETT>might have been able to get in and out undetected.

272
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,520
<11-5,JANSEN>我说了  探长
<11-5,JANSEN>I told you, detective,

273
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:21,200
<11-5,JANSEN>凭我们的安保力度  这不可能
<11-5,JANSEN>given our security, that's impossible.

274
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:22,560
<11-6,ED>先生
<11-6,ED>Sir.

275
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,180
<11-6,ED>或许没那么绝对
<11-6,ED>Maybe not.

276
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,230
<12-1,MISSION CONTROL TECH>按莱恩警探的要求
<12-1,MISSION CONTROL TECH>At detective Ryan's request,

277
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,540
<12-1,MISSION CONTROL TECH>我检查了我们所有的安全系统
<12-1,MISSION CONTROL TECH>I ran a check on all our security systems.

278
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:31,530
<12-1,MISSION CONTROL TECH>一切看起来很正常  直到我开始检查深层代码
<12-1,MISSION CONTROL TECH>Everything looked normal until I got into the deep code.

279
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:32,520
<12-2,MISSION CONTROL TECH>看到吗
<12-2,MISSION CONTROL TECH>See that?

280
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:34,160
<12-4,CASTLE>-天呐  -是什么
<12-4,CASTLE>- Oh, god. - What is it?

281
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:36,190
<12-5,JANSEN>我们的安全系统被入侵了
<12-5,JANSEN>Our security system's been hacked...

282
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,990
<12-5,JANSEN>钥匙卡  警报代码
<12-5,JANSEN>Key cards, alarm codes.

283
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,180
<12-6,BECKETT>所以有人可能闯入了模拟室
<12-6,BECKETT>Meaning someone could've broken into the simulation.

284
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:41,270
<12-7,MISSION CONTROL TECH>从我们的备份文件来看
<12-7,MISSION CONTROL TECH>Based on our back-up files,

285
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,810
<12-7,MISSION CONTROL TECH>这些改动是两天前做的
<12-7,MISSION CONTROL TECH>these changes were made two days ago,

286
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:45,980
<12-7,MISSION CONTROL TECH>在晚11点10分到11点14之间
<12-7,MISSION CONTROL TECH>sometime between 11:10 and 11:14 at night.

288
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:55,590
<12-8,JANSEN>数码追踪显示我们是从外部被入侵的
<12-8,JANSEN>Digital tracing indicates we were breached from the outside.

289
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,410
<12-8,JANSEN>有人闯入了我们的防火墙
<12-8,JANSEN>Someone broke through our firewall.

290
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,580
<12-9,BECKETT>能查到是谁吗
<12-9,BECKETT>Can you tell who?

291
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:01,640
<12-10,JANSEN>与主机项链的IP地址我们都有登记
<12-10,JANSEN>We log every I.P. Address that connects to the mainframe.

292
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:04,180
<12-10,JANSEN>我正在查那个时间段
<12-10,JANSEN>I'm running a trace now for that time window.

293
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:07,860
<12-11,JANSEN>那个  第三个  这个是陌生IP
<12-11,JANSEN>There. Third one down. I don't recognize that one.

294
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:09,290
<12-12,RYAN>好  我们应该能查到
<12-12,RYAN>All right, we should be able to trace it.

295
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,790
<12-13,JANSEN>不用  我查了
<12-13,JANSEN>Don't bother. I just did.

296
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,450
<12-13,JANSEN>来自民宅无线网络  登记在...
<12-13,JANSEN>It's coming from a residential wi-fi registered to a...

297
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,850
<12-13,JANSEN>开玩笑吧
<12-13,JANSEN>You got to be kidding me.

298
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,100
<12-14,BECKETT>是谁
<12-14,BECKETT>Who is it?

299
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,880
<12-14,BECKETT>克林特·格兰杰  急性子驾驶员
<12-14,BECKETT>Clint Granger, hothead pilot.

300
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:21,890
<12-15,JANSEN>他是申请人之一
<12-15,JANSEN>He was one of our applicants

301
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,640
<12-15,JANSEN>但被踢出了项目
<12-15,JANSEN>until he was kicked out of the program.

302
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:24,770
<12-16,CASTLE>为什么被踢走了
<12-16,CASTLE>Why'd he get kicked out?

303
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:27,880
<12-17,JANSEN>他指责汤姆在候选人测试期间给他搞了破坏
<12-17,JANSEN>He accused Tom of sabotaging him during candidate testing

304
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:29,580
<12-17,JANSEN>说这害他错失驾驶员一职
<12-17,JANSEN>and claimed it cost him the pilot spot.

305
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:32,260
<12-18,ED>于是他试图在停车场轧死汤姆
<12-18,ED>So he tried to run Tom over in the parking lot.

306
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,540
<12-19,BECKETT>什么时候的事
<12-19,BECKETT>And when was this?

307
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,840
<12-20,ED>七个月前
<12-20,ED>Seven months ago.

308
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:37,530
<12-20,ED>不过他确实说过要回来干完这事
<12-20,ED>But he did say he'd be back to finish the job.

309
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:39,990
<12-20,ED>是的  我当时很生气
<12-20,ED>Yeah, I was pissed.

310
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,550
<12-20,ED>我现在还是很生气
<12-20,ED>I'm still pissed.

311
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:44,020
<12-20,ED>在最后一轮前他往我的饮料里放了东西
<12-20,ED>He slipped something into my drink before the final round.

312
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,710
<12-20,ED>让我反应变慢了
<12-20,ED>Slowed my reaction time.

313
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,170
<13-1,BECKETT>所以你就用你的车去撞他
<13-1,BECKETT>So you tried to run him over with your car?

314
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,360
<13-2,GRANGER>应该是我去执行那个任务  不是他
<13-2,GRANGER>It should have been me on that mission, not him.

315
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,540
<13-2,GRANGER>应该是我留名青史
<13-2,GRANGER>He stole my spot in history.

316
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:57,030
<13-2,GRANGER>要是我说的话  他这是活该倒霉
<13-2,GRANGER>And you ask me, he got what he deserved.

317
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,310
<13-2,GRANGER>但我没有杀他
<13-2,GRANGER>But I did not kill him.

318
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,870
<13-3,RYAN>可是我们追踪到网络攻击的源头是你家
<13-3,RYAN>And yet we traced that cyber attack to your apartment.

319
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,650
<13-4,GRANGER>我是个驾驶员  不是电脑极客
<13-4,GRANGER>I am a pilot, not a computer geek.

320
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:07,170
<13-4,GRANGER>即便是任务急需我也写不出那代码
<13-4,GRANGER>I couldn't rewrite that code if the mission depended on it.

321
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,560
<13-5,BECKETT>你可能是雇了别人
<13-5,BECKETT>You could've hired someone.

322
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:10,620
<13-5,BECKETT>有可能  但我没有
<13-5,BECKETT>Yeah, but I didn't.

323
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,210
<13-6,GRANGER>汤姆被杀的时候
<13-6,GRANGER>Look, when Tom was getting himself murdered,

324
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:14,060
<14-1,BECKETT>我在康乃迪克州跟朋友吃饭
<14-1,BECKETT>I was at dinner with a friend in Connecticut.

325
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:15,810
<13-6,GRANGER>而且有人用我的无线网络进行攻击时
<13-6,GRANGER>And when that hack took place from my Wi-Fi,

326
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,740
<13-6,GRANGER>我甚至都不在国内
<13-6,GRANGER>I wasn't even in the country.

327
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,590
<13-6,GRANGER>有人在陷害我
<13-6,GRANGER>Someone's setting me up!

328
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:25,480
<14-1,BECKETT>格兰杰的不在场证据被证实了
<14-1,BECKETT>Granger's alibi checks out.

329
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:28,680
<14-1,BECKETT>汤姆·里奇伍德被杀时他的确在跟朋友吃饭
<14-1,BECKETT>He was at dinner with a friend when Tom Richwood was killed.

330
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:29,970
<14-2,CASTLE>黑客攻击那晚呢
<14-2,CASTLE>What about the night the hack took place?

331
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:32,320
<14-3,BECKETT>格兰杰去新斯科舍省[加拿大]看他兄弟了
<14-3,BECKETT>Granger was visiting his brother in Nova Scotia.

332
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:33,320
<14-3,BECKETT>不是他干的
<14-3,BECKETT>It wasn't him.

333
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:34,600
<14-4,RYAN>火星  新斯科舍省
<14-4,RYAN>Mars, Nova Scotia --

334
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:36,610
<14-4,RYAN>这家伙还真是喜欢荒凉的地方
<14-4,RYAN>this guy really loves barren landscapes.

335
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,460
<14-5,CASTLE>拜托  莱恩
<14-5,CASTLE>Come on, Ryan,

336
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:39,610
<14-5,CASTLE>难道你就不想去火星吗
<14-5,CASTLE>You're telling me you have no desire to go to Mars?

337
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,470
<14-6,RYAN>我还是喜欢不用氧气筒呼吸
<14-6,RYAN>I prefer my oxygen without a can.

338
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,880
<14-7,CASTLE>你的冒险精神哪去了
<14-7,CASTLE>Where's your sense of adventure?

339
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:43,590
<14-7,CASTLE>还有探索精神
<14-7,CASTLE>Of exploration?

340
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,120
<14-7,CASTLE>使命感
<14-7,CASTLE>Of... destiny?

341
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:49,570
<14-8,RYAN>如果让我飞几千英里去看一个没有生命的[星]球
<14-8,RYAN>If I want to fly thousands of miles to see a lifeless orb,

342
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,660
<14-8,RYAN>我还不如去珍妮的祖母家
<14-8,RYAN>I can just visit Jenny's grandmother.

343
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:55,260
<14-8,RYAN>都有敌对的气氛  都有寒冷的温度
<14-8,RYAN>Same hostile environment, same freezing temperatures,

344
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:57,740
<14-8,RYAN>都有有害的气体
<14-8,RYAN>Same noxious atmosphere.

345
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,500
<14-9,BECKETT>什么情况
<14-9,BECKETT>Huh? "Huh," What?

346
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:03,190
<14-10,RYAN>有段视频  是在黑客攻击那晚
<14-10,RYAN>Well, this is a video of Granger's apartment lobby

347
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,670
<14-10,RYAN>格兰杰公寓大厅的  来看看
<14-10,RYAN>the night of the hack -- check it out.

348
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,270
<14-10,RYAN>这家伙晚上11:05进入的大楼
<14-10,RYAN>This guy enters the building at 11:05 P.M.,

349
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,830
<14-10,RYAN>就在黑客攻击之前
<14-10,RYAN>Just before the hack took place.

350
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,930
<14-10,RYAN>再看看这个
<14-10,RYAN>Now watch.

351
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:14,000
<14-10,RYAN>15分钟之后
<14-10,RYAN>15 minutes later.

352
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:19,700
<14-11,BECKETT>他离开了大楼
<14-11,BECKETT>He leaves the building.

353
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:22,700
<14-11,BECKETT>他可能是盗用了格兰杰的无线网络
<14-11,BECKETT>He could've piggybacked on Granger's wireless

354
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:26,120
<14-11,BECKETT>对模拟室的安全网络实施了攻击
<14-11,BECKETT>and used that to carry out the attack on the simulation security.

355
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:28,950
<14-12,RYAN>是的  可他是谁呢
<14-12,RYAN>Yeah, but who is he?

356
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:30,910
<15-1,ESPOSITO>名字叫乔治·雷尔
<15-1,ESPOSITO>Name's George Reyes.

357
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,770
<15-1,ESPOSITO>火星2018的人立刻认出了他
<15-1,ESPOSITO>The folks down at Mars 2018 recognized him immediately.

358
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,140
<15-1,ESPOSITO>他是高级设备工程师
<15-1,ESPOSITO>He's the senior facilities engineer,

359
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,660
<15-1,ESPOSITO>昨天请了病假
<15-1,ESPOSITO>And he called in sick yesterday.

360
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,120
<15-1,ESPOSITO>之后就没人再联系上他了
<15-1,ESPOSITO>Nobody's been able to reach him since.

361
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:39,440
<15-2,BECKETT>他有没有动机
<15-2,BECKETT>Did he have a motive to break

362
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:41,050
<15-2,BECKETT>潜入模拟室  杀掉汤姆呢
<15-2,BECKETT>into the simulation and kill Tom?

363
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,770
<15-3,ESPOSITO>没人知道  不过他的同事们说
<15-3,ESPOSITO>Not that anyone knew, but his colleagues say

364
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,810
<15-3,ESPOSITO>他最近几天一直行为很神秘
<15-3,ESPOSITO>that he's been acting secretive the last couple of days,

365
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,390
<15-3,ESPOSITO>自从接到了他妻子的信件后就这样
<15-3,ESPOSITO>ever since receiving a private communique from his wife.

366
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,030
<15-4,CASTLE>他妻子跟这有什么关系
<15-4,CASTLE>What does his wife got to do with this?

367
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,880
<15-5,ESPOSITO>有很大关系  知道他妻子是谁吗
<15-5,ESPOSITO>Maybe everything. Ask me who his wife is.

368
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:51,490
<15-6,CASTLE>是谁
<15-6,CASTLE>Who's his wife?

369
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,950
<15-7,ESPOSITO>安琪拉·奥维拉  是其中一个航天员
<15-7,ESPOSITO>Angela Olvera, one of the other astronauts.

370
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,280
<15-8,BECKETT>那信的内容是什么
<15-8,BECKETT>So, what was on the message?

371
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:02,280
<16-1,ANGELA>我是想让乔治知道我想离婚了
<16-1,ANGELA>I was letting George know that I wanted out of our marriage.

372
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:03,880
<16-2,CASTLE>他在太空跟他分手
<16-2,CASTLE>You broke up with him from space?

373
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:06,310
<16-3,ANGELA>他一直在给我发情书
<16-3,ANGELA>He was sending me all these sweet e-mails.

374
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,070
<16-3,ANGELA>我不能让这继续下去了
<16-3,ANGELA>I couldn't let it go on.

375
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,550
<16-3,ANGELA>我必须得告诉他我爱上别人了
<16-3,ANGELA>I had to tell him that I'd fallen for someone else,

376
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:13,360
<16-3,ANGELA>我们任务里的人
<16-3,ANGELA>someone on the mission.

377
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:14,440
<16-4,CASTLE>是汤姆吗
<16-4,CASTLE>Was it Tom?

378
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:16,220
<16-5,ANGELA>不  不是汤姆
<16-5,ANGELA>No. Not Tom.

379
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:22,550
<16-6,ANGELA>天哪
<16-6,ANGELA>Oh, God.

380
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,780
<16-7,BECKETT>怎么了
<16-7,BECKETT>What?

381
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,470
<16-7,BECKETT>安琪拉
<16-7,BECKETT>Angela?

382
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,920
<16-8,ANGELA>我在信里没说是谁
<16-8,ANGELA>I didn't say who it was in my letter.

383
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:31,040
<16-8,ANGELA>可能他以为是汤姆
<16-8,ANGELA>Maybe he thought it was Tom.

384
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,730
<16-9,BECKETT>他有理由这么认为吗
<16-9,BECKETT>Did he have reason to?

385
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,450
<16-10,ANGELA>是的
<16-10,ANGELA>Yeah, he did.

386
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:37,270
<16-10,ANGELA>汤姆在训练期间一直在追求我
<16-10,ANGELA>Tom wouldn't stop hitting on me all through training.

387
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,720
<16-10,ANGELA>乔治跟他说如果他不住手  就要付出代价的
<16-10,ANGELA>George told him if he didn't stop, he'd make him pay.

388
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:44,970
<16-11,ESPOSITO>找到他了  在机场
<16-11,ESPOSITO>We found him. He's at the airport.

389
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,530
<16-11,ESPOSITO>刚买了一张去旧金山的机票
<16-11,ESPOSITO>Just bought a ticket to San Francisco.

390
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,600
<16-11,ESPOSITO>机场的保安逮住了他
<16-11,ESPOSITO>Airport security just picked him up.

391
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:53,580
<17-1,GEORGE REYES>安琪拉和我是一个团队
<17-1,GEORGE REYES>We were a team, Angela and me.

392
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:56,160
<17-1,GEORGE REYES>我们要么一起去火星  要么都不去
<17-1,GEORGE REYES>We were gonna go to Mars together or not at all.

393
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:57,960
<17-1,GEORGE REYES>可当她入选  而我落选时
<17-1,GEORGE REYES>But when she got in and I didn't,

394
00:15:57,970 --> 00:15:59,550
<17-1,GEORGE REYES>我也不能妨碍她的事业
<17-1,GEORGE REYES>I couldn't stand in her way.

395
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,200
<17-2,CASTLE>看着她离开地球已经够让你难受的了
<17-2,CASTLE>Hard enough to have her leave the planet,

396
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,790
<17-2,CASTLE>可看到她为了别人离开你...
<17-2,CASTLE>but to leave you for someone else...

397
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,620
<17-2,CASTLE>你一定很绝望
<17-2,CASTLE>you must have been devastated.

398
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:08,020
<17-3,GEORGE>是非常绝望
<17-3,GEORGE>Try utterly destroyed.

399
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:11,260
<17-4,BECKETT>所以你才黑进了安保系统吗
<17-4,BECKETT>Is that why you hacked security?

400
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,890
<17-4,BECKETT>为了破坏模拟室
<17-4,BECKETT>In order to break into the simulation

401
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,060
<17-4,BECKETT>并杀死你以为是安琪拉情人的人
<17-4,BECKETT>and kill the man that you thought was Angela's lover?

402
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:18,310
<17-4,BECKETT>我说了  我跟汤姆的死没有关系
<17-4,BECKETT>I'm telling you, I had nothing to do with Tom's death.

403
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,660
<17-5,GEORGE>我是想破坏这次任务
<17-5,GEORGE>I was going to sabotage the mission.

404
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,090
<17-5,GEORGE>我想如果模拟室出现重大故障
<17-5,GEORGE>I figured if the simulation suffered a catastrophic failure,

405
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,370
<17-5,GEORGE>就能够拖延这个项目
<17-5,GEORGE>it would set the program back,

406
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,710
<17-5,GEORGE>安琪拉就能回到我身边
<17-5,GEORGE>and Angela would come home to me.

407
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,600
<17-5,GEORGE>但是我临阵退缩了
<17-5,GEORGE>But I chickened out.

408
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:32,840
<17-5,GEORGE>那次攻击
<17-5,GEORGE>The hack,

409
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:34,340
<17-5,GEORGE>嫁祸到格兰杰身上
<17-5,GEORGE>setting it up to lead back to Granger --

410
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:36,220
<17-5,GEORGE>我只敢做到那一步了
<17-5,GEORGE>that's as far as I got.

411
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:37,430
<17-5,GEORGE>我没进去过
<17-5,GEORGE>I never went inside,

412
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,830
<17-5,GEORGE>也没杀过任何人
<17-5,GEORGE>and I sure as hell didn't kill anyone.

413
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:42,980
<17-6,CASTLE>那你为什么要离开这里
<17-6,CASTLE>Then why were you leaving town?

414
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,790
<17-7,GEORGE>她甩了我
<17-7,GEORGE>She dumped me.

415
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,550
<17-7,GEORGE>我怎么还能继续在那里工作
<17-7,GEORGE>How was I supposed to keep going to work there?

416
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,470
<17-7,GEORGE>我需要一个新的开始
<17-7,GEORGE>I needed a fresh start.

417
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:51,560
<17-7,GEORGE>自从我收到她的信后
<17-7,GEORGE>And since I got her letter,

418
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:55,270
<17-7,GEORGE>我好几个晚上都在奥马里酒吧借酒消愁
<17-7,GEORGE>I've spent nights drowning my sorrows at O'malley's.

419
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,640
<17-7,GEORGE>汤姆被杀时我就在那里
<17-7,GEORGE>That's where I was when Tom was murdered.

420
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:59,660
<17-7,GEORGE>-你可以去问他们  -好吧  本
<17-7,GEORGE>- You can ask them. - Okay, Ben.

421
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:01,860
<17-8,BECKETT>还有谁能利用你的攻击
<17-8,BECKETT>So who else could've used your hack

422
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:03,690
<17-8,BECKETT>穿过模拟室的气闸门
<17-8,BECKETT>to get through the simulation's airlock?

423
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:06,030
<17-9,GEORGE>需要用我的生物特征才行  没人做得到
<17-9,GEORGE>It was calibrated to my biometrics. No one else could've used it.

424
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,970
<17-10,CASTLE>-但的确有人做到了  -不
<17-10,CASTLE>- But someone did. - No.

425
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,900
<17-11,GEORGE>就算有人进去了  也是通过别的方法
<17-11,GEORGE>If they got in, they did it some other way.

426
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:12,080
<17-12,BECKETT>没有别的方法了
<17-12,BECKETT>There is no other way.

427
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:14,170
<17-13,GEORGE>这我可不确定
<17-13,GEORGE>I'm not so sure about that.

428
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,760
<17-14,BECKETT>你什么意思
<17-14,BECKETT>What do you mean?

429
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:17,590
<17-15,GEORGE>我研究过设施的规划设计
<17-15,GEORGE>I studied the facility plans.

430
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,830
<17-15,GEORGE>模拟室就像一座银行金库
<17-15,GEORGE>The simulation is like a bank vault.

431
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,440
<17-15,GEORGE>想要进去  你得绕过保安
<17-15,GEORGE>To get in, you got to get past guards,

432
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:24,100
<17-15,GEORGE>安保系统  摄像头
<17-15,GEORGE>security systems, cameras.

433
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:26,030
<17-15,GEORGE>不过就像金库一样
<17-15,GEORGE>But like a bank vault,

434
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:28,470
<17-15,GEORGE>只要你有足够的动力
<17-15,GEORGE>if you're motivated enough,

435
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:30,880
<17-15,GEORGE>一定有办法进去
<17-15,GEORGE>there's always another way in.

436
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:39,010
<18-1,CASTLE>你真的认为有人
<18-1,CASTLE>You really think someone

437
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:41,380
<18-1,CASTLE>会通过地道进入模拟室
<18-1,CASTLE>could've tunneled their way into the sim?

438
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:44,410
<18-2,BECKETT>不  但既然乔治的不在场证明被证实了
<18-2,BECKETT>No, but since George's alibi checked out,

439
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:47,020
<18-2,BECKETT>我们就得查看所有的可能性
<18-2,BECKETT>we're gonna have to look at all of our options,

440
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:50,350
<18-2,BECKETT>包括这种不太可能的
<18-2,BECKETT>including the unlikely ones.

441
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:53,140
<18-2,BECKETT>根据乔治的地图
<18-2,BECKETT>According to George's map,

442
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:55,740
<18-2,BECKETT>这个遗弃的设施通道
<18-2,BECKETT>This abandoned utility access

443
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,980
<18-2,BECKETT>就在詹森的大楼下面
<18-2,BECKETT>runs directly under Jansen's facility.

444
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:00,410
<18-3,CASTLE>是的  不过有谁如此恨汤姆
<18-3,CASTLE>Yeah, but who would hate Tom enough

445
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,970
<18-3,CASTLE>以至于愿意穿过五英尺的混凝土地道去杀他
<18-3,CASTLE>to tunnel through 5 feet of concrete to kill him?

446
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,030
<18-4,BECKETT>不知道  不过...
<18-4,BECKETT>I don't know, but...

447
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,330
<18-4,BECKETT>不过有人似乎真的这么做了
<18-4,BECKETT>but it looks like someone did.

448
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:12,830
<18-5,BECKETT>卡塞尔  抬我上去
<18-5,BECKETT>Castle, boost me up.

449
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,660
<18-6,CASTLE>为什么每次都是我在下面
<18-6,CASTLE>Why am I always on the bottom?

450
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:17,030
<18-7,CASTLE>遵命  亲爱的
<18-7,CASTLE>Yes, dear.

451
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,350
<18-8,CASTLE>星球上潮湿的入口
<18-8,CASTLE>Planets dank access ways...

452
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,420
<18-8,CASTLE>难道没有让你想起《异形》吗
<18-8,CASTLE>is it just me, or does this remind you of "Alien"?

453
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:24,690
<18-9,BECKETT>我知道你希望这就像科幻片那样
<18-9,BECKETT>I know that you want this to be science-fiction,

454
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,980
<18-9,BECKETT>但我们不是在太空里
<18-9,BECKETT>but we are not in space.

455
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:27,910
<18-10,CASTLE>确实  但难道你都不希望如此吗
<18-10,CASTLE>No, but wouldn't you like it to be?

456
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,830
<18-10,CASTLE>拜托  你是科幻极客
<18-10,CASTLE>Come on, you're a sci-fi geek.

457
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,190
<18-10,CASTLE>-你难道不想去火星吗  -我当然想
<18-10,CASTLE>- Wouldn't you just love to go to Mars? - Of course I would.

458
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:32,880
<18-11,BECKETT>所以我才申请了
<18-11,BECKETT>That's why I applied

459
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:35,690
<18-11,BECKETT>去年伊恩·拉什尔的项目
<18-11,BECKETT>to Ian Rasher's program last year!

460
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,380
<18-12,CASTLE>等等  什么  你申请了登陆火星计划
<18-12,CASTLE>Wait, what? You applied to go to Mars?

461
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:39,610
<18-12,CASTLE>还不带我  什么时候啊
<18-12,CASTLE>Without me? When?

462
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,980
<18-13,BECKETT>我们当时吵架了
<18-13,BECKETT>Well, we were fighting.

463
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,360
<18-14,CASTLE>好吧  我活该
<18-14,CASTLE>Oh, okay. Well, I deserved that.

464
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:45,630
<18-15,BECKETT>天哪  卡塞尔
<18-15,BECKETT>Oh, geez, Castle.

465
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,060
<18-16,CASTLE>看到什么了吗
<18-16,CASTLE>See anything?

466
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:51,300
<18-17,BECKETT>确实有人来过
<18-17,BECKETT>Someone did tunnel up.

467
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,130
<18-17,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<18-17,BECKETT>Castle?

468
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,680
<18-17,BECKETT>我想我找到了凶器
<18-17,BECKETT>I think I found the murder weapon.

469
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,590
<18-18,CASTLE>你听到了吗
<18-18,CASTLE>Did you hear that?

470
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,650
<18-19,BECKETT>听到什么
<18-19,BECKETT>Whoa. Hear what?

471
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:07,790
<18-20,BECKETT>怎么回事
<18-20,BECKETT>What happened?

472
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,790
<18-21,CASTLE>那里有东西
<18-21,CASTLE>Something's down here.

473
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,140
<18-22,BECKETT>不是人吗
<18-22,BECKETT>Some thing?

474
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,390
<18-23,BECKETT>那到底是什么啊
<18-23,BECKETT>What the hell is that?

475
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,130
<19-1,CASTLE>我跟你说了太像《异形》了
<19-1,CASTLE>Told you this felt like "Alien."

476
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,410
<19-2,BECKETT>卡塞尔  够了  这不是《异形》
<19-2,BECKETT>Castle, stop. This is not "Alien."

477
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,700
<19-3,CASTLE>你觉得那像人类吗
<19-3,CASTLE>Did that look human to you?

478
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,360
<19-4,BECKETT>确实不像
<19-4,BECKETT>Actually, no.

479
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:31,330
<19-4,BECKETT>那就对了
<19-4,BECKETT>Right.

480
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:32,650
<19-5,CASTLE>我打赌那是异形
<19-5,CASTLE>See, I'm betting it's a xenomorph

481
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:35,380
<19-5,CASTLE>被困地球  被模拟室
<19-5,CASTLE>stranded here on earth, attracted to the simulation

482
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:36,870
<19-5,CASTLE>吸引  因为它需要毒气环境
<19-5,CASTLE>because it needs the toxic environment.

483
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,560
<19-5,CASTLE>也许它是觉得汤姆侵犯了自己的领地
<19-5,CASTLE>It probably saw Tom as encroaching on its territory

484
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:41,070
<19-5,CASTLE>才杀掉了他
<19-5,CASTLE>and killed him for it.

485
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:41,590
<19-6,BECKETT>你干什么
<19-6,BECKETT>What are you doing?

486
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,060
<19-7,CASTLE>检查你身上有没有抓伤咬伤
<19-7,CASTLE>I'm checking you for bites and scratches.

487
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:45,690
<19-7,CASTLE>确保你没被产卵
<19-7,CASTLE>Making sure you didn't somehow get impregnated.

488
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:48,510
<19-8,BECKETT>你要觉得我这样受孕  那我们真得谈谈
<19-8,BECKETT>If you think that's how I get pregnant, we need to talk.

489
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:51,230
<19-9,BECKETT>在那
<19-9,BECKETT>There!

490
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:58,520
<19-10,CASTLE>贝克特
<19-10,CASTLE>Beckett!

491
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,420
<19-11,CASTLE>它蜕皮了
<19-11,CASTLE>It shed its skin.

492
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:07,920
<19-12,BECKETT>不是皮
<19-12,BECKETT>It's not skin.

493
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:09,480
<19-12,BECKETT>是防毒面具
<19-12,BECKETT>It's a gas mask.

494
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:13,250
<19-13,CASTLE>这是个呼吸管  人类用的
<19-13,CASTLE>It's a breathing hose. For a human.

495
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,970
<19-14,BECKETT>因为模拟室的烟雾
<19-14,BECKETT>To protect themselves from the fumes of the simulation.

496
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:18,410
<19-14,BECKETT>确实有人想闯进来
<19-14,BECKETT>Someone was trying to break in.

497
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,570
<20-1,HAROUM>没错  这里是进入点
<20-1,HAROUM>Yes, this was the access point.

498
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:26,200
<20-2,JANSEN>为什么会有人想溜进我的模拟室
<20-2,JANSEN>Why would someone tunnel into my simulation?

499
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:27,610
<20-3,CASTLE>也许是你的对手
<20-3,CASTLE>Well, maybe it's one of your competitors.

500
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,990
<20-3,CASTLE>目的可能是刺探情报或者搞破坏
<20-3,CASTLE>It could be espionage... or sabotage.

501
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,360
<20-4,BECKETT>也许被害人发现了他们
<20-4,BECKETT>And our victim might have found out

502
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:33,070
<20-4,BECKETT>并威胁说要揭发
<20-4,BECKETT>and threatened to expose them.

503
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,860
<20-5,CASTLE>不管是哪种  这能解释
<20-5,CASTLE>Either way, this explains what he saw,

504
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:37,130
<20-5,CASTLE>他为什么觉得当时还有别人在
<20-5,CASTLE>why he thought there was someone else in there with him.

505
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,450
<20-6,JANSEN>他们是怎么躲开我的监控摄像头的
<20-6,JANSEN>How did they elude my cameras?

506
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,670
<20-7,BECKETT>也许他们和你项目中的
<20-7,BECKETT>Well, maybe they were working with someone

507
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,160
<20-7,BECKETT>内部人员串通
<20-7,BECKETT>that was involved in your program

508
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:43,130
<20-7,BECKETT>知道摄像头关闭的时间
<20-7,BECKETT>and knew when the cameras would be blacked out.

509
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,300
<20-8,BECKETT>失陪
<20-8,BECKETT>Excuse me.

511
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,800
<20-9,ESPOSITO>鉴证科证实了
<20-9,ESPOSITO>So, CSU just confirmed it.

512
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:49,840
<20-9,ESPOSITO>螺丝刀上的血迹确实是汤姆的
<20-9,ESPOSITO>The blood on the screwdriver belonged to Tom.

513
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:51,790
<20-10,BECKETT>-确实是本案的凶器  -上面有指纹吗
<20-10,BECKETT>- It's our murder weapon. - Okay, any prints?

514
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,980
<20-11,ESPOSITO>没有  但如果凶手当时在模拟室里
<20-11,ESPOSITO>No, but if the killer was in the simulation...

515
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:55,710
<20-12,BECKETT>那肯定是戴着手套的
<20-12,BECKETT>then they would have been wearing gloves.

516
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,110
<20-12,BECKETT>好吧  那防毒面具呢
<20-12,BECKETT>Um, okay, what about the gas mask?

517
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:57,850
<20-12,BECKETT>有什么线索吗
<20-12,BECKETT>Anything from that?

518
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,010
<20-12,BECKETT>看起来像军用设备
<20-12,BECKETT>It looks military,

519
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,660
<20-13,ESPOSITO>但我们还在试图追踪来源
<20-13,ESPOSITO>But we're still trying to run it down.

520
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:02,620
<20-13,ESPOSITO>还有  莱恩正在查看周边
<20-13,ESPOSITO>Meantime, Ryan's pulling camera footage

521
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:03,760
<20-13,ESPOSITO>区域的监控录像
<20-13,ESPOSITO>from the surrounding area.

522
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:04,790
<20-13,ESPOSITO>幸运的话
<20-13,ESPOSITO>Maybe we'll get lucky,

523
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,010
<20-13,ESPOSITO>也许我们可以
<20-13,ESPOSITO>catch our alien exiting

524
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:08,150
<20-13,ESPOSITO>看到外星凶手走出通道出口
<20-13,ESPOSITO>one of the access points to the utility tunnel.

525
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,490
<20-13,ESPOSITO>结果可能要等明早出来了
<20-13,ESPOSITO>Probably won't know anything till morning.

526
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,030
<20-14,BECKETT>好的  保持联络
<20-14,BECKETT>All right, keep me apprised.

527
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,280
<20-15,BECKETT>你帮我们想想有谁
<20-15,BECKETT>Okay, why don't you think about anyone

528
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:15,890
<20-15,BECKETT>会想要破坏你的模拟室
<20-15,BECKETT>that would have wanted to breach your simulation,

529
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,450
<20-15,BECKETT>我们查到什么会通知你
<20-15,BECKETT>and we'll keep you posted on what we find.

530
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,330
<20-15,BECKETT>好
<20-15,BECKETT>Yeah.

531
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:20,750
<21-1,BECKETT>天哪
<21-1,BECKETT>Oh, my god.

532
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,990
<21-1,BECKETT>诡异的一天
<21-1,BECKETT>What a day.

533
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,880
<21-1,BECKETT>我觉得现在身上还有蜘蛛网呢
<21-1,BECKETT>I feel like I'm still covered in spider webs.

534
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:26,680
<21-1,BECKETT>简直等不及冲个热水澡了
<21-1,BECKETT>I cannot wait to take a hot shower.

535
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:29,600
<21-2,CASTLE>也许我可以  和你一起洗
<21-2,CASTLE>Oh, maybe I could, uh, join you.

536
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:30,420
<21-3,BECKETT>那真好
<21-3,BECKETT>Ooh, that'd be nice.

537
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:32,730
<21-3,BECKETT>我们可以放松一下  倒杯红酒
<21-3,BECKETT>We could relax, have a glass of wine --

538
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:35,220
<21-4,CASTLE>听到了吗
<21-4,CASTLE>Do you hear that?

539
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:37,160
<21-5,BECKETT>是你妈妈的声音
<21-5,BECKETT>It's your mom.

540
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,370
<21-6,CASTLE>还有本
<21-6,CASTLE>And Ben.

541
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,450
<21-6,CASTLE>而且阿莱克西斯也在
<21-6,CASTLE>And Alexis is here.

542
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,080
<21-7,BECKETT>还带着朋友
<21-7,BECKETT>With friends.

543
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:43,990
<21-8,CASTLE>不如我们去旅馆吧
<21-8,CASTLE>Maybe we could go to a hotel.

544
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,060
<21-9,BECKETT>你还说你可以忍受
<21-9,BECKETT>And yet you think you could survive

545
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,170
<21-9,BECKETT>在一个小太空舱里
<21-9,BECKETT>being stuck in a space capsule

546
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,280
<21-9,BECKETT>和四个人一起困一年呢
<21-9,BECKETT>with four other people for a year.

547
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:50,050
<21-10,CASTLE>我可以啊  如果你是四人之一的话
<21-10,CASTLE>I could, if you were one of those people.

548
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,100
<21-12,ALEXIS>你们俩啊
<21-12,ALEXIS>You guys.

549
00:21:58,830 --> 00:21:59,580
<21-13,ALEXIS>单独找个房间吧
<21-13,ALEXIS>Get a room.

550
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:01,380
<21-14,CASTLE>我们很愿意啊  如果还有空房间的话
<21-14,CASTLE>We would, if there were any left!

551
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:07,990
<22-1,CASTLE>也许你不该这么快就把你的房子转租了
<22-1,CASTLE>Maybe you shouldn't have been so quick to sublet your place.

552
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,050
<22-2,BECKETT>我们可以定个时间表
<22-2,BECKETT>You know, maybe we can just set up a schedule,

553
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,690
<22-2,BECKETT>或者让他们提前通知我们一声
<22-2,BECKETT>or they could give us a heads-up

554
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,850
<22-2,BECKETT>不必让我们回家时大吃一惊
<22-2,BECKETT>and let us know what to expect when we get home.

555
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,670
<22-3,CASTLE>我要开一个家庭会议
<22-3,CASTLE>I'm gonna call a family meeting.

556
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:17,070
<22-3,CASTLE>或者我们直接去火星吧
<22-3,CASTLE>Or we could just go to Mars.

557
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:19,100
<22-4,BECKETT>我想你不会喜欢住火星的
<22-4,BECKETT>Yeah, I don't think you'd be happy there.

558
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,930
<22-4,BECKETT>那里没有淋浴  有速溶咖啡
<22-4,BECKETT>There's no showers, there's instant coffee,

559
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:21,750
<22-4,BECKETT>而且你得自己动手
<22-4,BECKETT>and you have to bag your own --

560
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,140
<22-5,RYAN>早啊  卡塞尔夫妇
<22-5,RYAN>Hey, Castles!

561
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:25,500
<22-6,BECKETT>监控录像查到什么线索了吗
<22-6,BECKETT>Hey. Any luck on that security-cam footage?

562
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,280
<22-7,RYAN>没有  这个外星人走的肯定是
<22-7,RYAN>Nada. Your alien must've accessed

563
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:29,020
<22-7,RYAN>没有摄像头的地下通道
<22-7,RYAN>the underground where there wasn't any coverage.

564
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:31,470
<22-7,RYAN>但防毒面具的调查倒是有进展
<22-7,RYAN>But we did have better luck with that gas mask.

565
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:34,490
<22-7,RYAN>鉴证科在面具内侧发现了
<22-7,RYAN>CSU was able to pull exhaled-breath condensate

566
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,950
<22-7,RYAN>呼出凝结物
<22-7,RYAN>from inside the face plate.

567
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,880
<22-7,RYAN>里面包含着少量DNA
<22-7,RYAN>It contained trace amounts of DNA.

568
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:39,070
<22-8,BECKETT>系统里找到匹配了吗
<22-8,BECKETT>We get a match in the system?

569
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,220
<22-9,RYAN>我们系统里没有
<22-9,RYAN>Not our system,

570
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:42,730
<22-9,RYAN>但2018火星计划中
<22-9,RYAN>but as part of the Mars 2018 program,

571
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:45,700
<22-9,RYAN>每位申请者都要提交DNA样本
<22-9,RYAN>every applicant had to submit sample DNA.

572
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:47,470
<22-9,RYAN>所以我们在那个系统里进行检索
<22-9,RYAN>So, we ran it against that database,

573
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,000
<22-9,RYAN>-猜猜找到了谁  -不会吧
<22-9,RYAN>- and guess who popped up. - No!

574
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:51,020
<22-10,CASTLE>外星人是格兰杰啊
<22-10,CASTLE>Granger's our alien?

575
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:52,220
<22-11,BECKETT>他是进出了模拟室
<22-11,BECKETT>So, he was getting in and out,

576
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:53,700
<22-11,BECKETT>只是走的路出乎意料
<22-11,BECKETT>just not the way we thought.

577
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:55,720
<22-12,CASTLE>也就是说他的不在场证明是谎话
<22-12,CASTLE>Which means his alibi was a lie.

578
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:57,180
<22-12,CASTLE>当他得知我们查到他了
<22-12,CASTLE>As soon as he knew we were onto him --

579
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:58,720
<22-13,BECKETT>他就回去销毁证据
<22-13,BECKETT>he went back to destroy the evidence.

580
00:22:58,730 --> 00:22:59,710
<22-13,BECKETT>你把他带过来了吗
<22-13,BECKETT>You bringing him in?

581
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,900
<22-14,RYAN>找到的话我会的
<22-14,RYAN>I would if we could find him,

582
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:02,290
<22-14,RYAN>但他不在家
<22-14,RYAN>But he's not at his place

583
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,560
<22-14,RYAN>也不接电话
<22-14,RYAN>and he's not answering his phone.

584
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:04,760
<22-15,BECKETT>发个全境通告
<22-15,BECKETT>Okay, put out an APB.

585
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:07,460
<22-15,BECKETT>地下黑暗中遭遇后  他可能已经逃跑了
<22-15,BECKETT>After our encounter in the dark, he might be on the run.

586
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:08,820
<22-16,ESPOSITO>我也许有办法找到他
<22-16,ESPOSITO>I may know how to find him.

587
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:11,190
<22-16,ESPOSITO>那个防毒面具  并不是常见的东西
<22-16,ESPOSITO>That gas mask -- it's an uncommon make.

588
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,920
<22-16,ESPOSITO>城里能提供它的卖家不多
<22-16,ESPOSITO>Not a lot of suppliers in the city carry them.

589
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:14,220
<22-16,ESPOSITO>但我通过它的序列号
<22-16,ESPOSITO>But I was able to track down the serial number

590
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:16,080
<22-16,ESPOSITO>找到了上城一家军用设备供应商
<22-16,ESPOSITO>to an army/navy supply store uptown.

591
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:17,940
<22-17,BECKETT>他们证明面具是格兰杰买的了吗
<22-17,BECKETT>Did they confirm that Granger bought it?

592
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:19,820
<22-18,ESPOSITO>没有  面具是几个月前卖出的了
<22-18,ESPOSITO>No, the mask was purchased a couple months back,

593
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:20,800
<22-18,ESPOSITO>所以没人记得买主
<22-18,ESPOSITO>so no one remembered the buyer,

594
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:22,440
<22-18,ESPOSITO>但付款的是个公司帐户
<22-18,ESPOSITO>but it was charged to a corporate account --

595
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:23,820
<22-18,ESPOSITO>一个叫纽顿实业的公司
<22-18,ESPOSITO>a company called Newton Endeavors.

596
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,460
<22-19,BECKETT>-都了解多少情况  -不多
<22-19,BECKETT>- What do we know about them? - Not much.

597
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:26,760
<22-20,ESPOSITO>网上找不到任何信息
<22-20,ESPOSITO>I couldn't find anything on the web,

598
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:28,230
<22-20,ESPOSITO>但我找到了一个地址
<22-20,ESPOSITO>but I was able to track down an address

599
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,730
<22-20,ESPOSITO>在皇后区的威利点
<22-20,ESPOSITO>out in Queens in Willets Point.

600
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,740
<22-21,BECKETT>干的好
<22-21,BECKETT>Well done.

<23-1,BECKETT>Sounds space related.

603
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:38,340
<23-2,CASTLE>太空  最后的边疆[《星际迷航》台词]
<23-2,CASTLE>Space -- the final frontier.

604
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,900
<23-2,CASTLE>开启卡塞尔和贝克特的冒险之旅
<23-2,CASTLE>These are the voyages of Castle and Beckett.

605
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,480
<23-2,CASTLE>不间断的任务
<23-2,CASTLE>Their ongoing mission --

606
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:44,490
<23-2,CASTLE>探索不同的犯案动机
<23-2,CASTLE>to explore strange new motives,

607
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:48,060
<23-2,CASTLE>找出罪案的新证人和新疑犯
<23-2,CASTLE>to seek out new witnesses and new suspects for murder,

608
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,040
<23-2,CASTLE>勇于探索...
<23-2,CASTLE>to boldly go where --

609
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:50,260
<23-2,CASTLE>就是这儿
<23-2,CASTLE>Oh, right over here.

610

611
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:54,430
<23-3,BECKETT>这是纽顿实业吗
<23-3,BECKETT>Is this Newton Endeavors?

612
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,800
<23-4,SECURITY GUARD>抱歉  这是私人领地
<23-4,SECURITY GUARD>Oh, I'm sorry. This is private property.

613
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,470
<23-4,SECURITY GUARD>请你们离开
<23-4,SECURITY GUARD>I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

<23-5,BECKETT>请你开门
<23-5,BECKETT>I'm gonna have to ask you to open that door.

616
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:12,540
<24-1,BECKETT>不是吧
<24-1,BECKETT>What the hell?

617
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:18,310
<24-2,CASTLE>这是我的幻觉  还是这太空舱看着很眼熟
<24-2,CASTLE>Is it just me, or does that capsule look incredibly familiar?

618
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:30,040
<25-1,BECKETT>谁会想仿造詹森的火星移居地啊
<25-1,BECKETT>Who would want to build a replica of Jansen's Mars colony?

619
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:31,270
<25-2,CASTLE>他的竞争对手
<25-2,CASTLE>The competition.

620
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:33,780
<25-2,CASTLE>格兰杰一定是潜入模拟室
<25-2,CASTLE>Granger must have been breaking into the sim

621
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:36,610
<25-2,CASTLE>帮詹森的对手窃取技术
<25-2,CASTLE>to steal technology for Jansen's competitors.

622
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:38,380
<25-3,IAN RASHER>我不介意付他们三倍工资
<25-3,IAN RASHER>I don't care if we have to pay them triple.

623
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:40,760
<25-3,IAN RASHER>我们不能再落后于人了
<25-3,IAN RASHER>We cannot fall any further behind.

624
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:42,540
<25-4,BECKETT>我想我知道是谁了
<25-4,BECKETT>And I think I know which one.

625
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,650
<25-5,CASTLE>伊恩·拉什尔爵士
<25-5,CASTLE>Yep. Sir Ian Rasher.

626
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,700
<25-5,CASTLE>亿万富翁  纨绔子弟  冒险家
<25-5,CASTLE>Billionaire playboy adventurer.

627
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:49,860
<25-6,BECKETT>也可能是谋杀案从犯
<25-6,BECKETT>And possible accessory to murder.

628
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:51,040
<25-7,CASTLE>也许你该反思
<25-7,CASTLE>You may want to rethink

629
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:53,270
<25-7,CASTLE>申请加入他项目的做法
<25-7,CASTLE>your application to his program.

630
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,330
<25-9,BECKETT>拉什尔先生吗  纽约警察  贝克特探长
<25-9,BECKETT>Mr. Rasher? Detective Beckett, NYPD.

631
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,750
<25-9,BECKETT>-能聊一聊吗  -当然
<25-9,BECKETT>- I was wondering if we could have a word. - Of course.

632
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,560
<25-10,RASHER>我有什么可以帮到纽约警察的
<25-10,RASHER>What can I do for New York's finest?

633
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:04,100
<25-11,BECKETT>你可以先告诉我克林特·格兰杰在哪里
<25-11,BECKETT>Well, you can start by telling me where Clint Granger is.

634
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:05,840
<25-12,RASHER>抱歉  探长
<25-12,RASHER>I'm sorry, detective.

635
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:08,630
<25-12,RASHER>我恐怕不认识这个人
<25-12,RASHER>I'm afraid I don't know who that is.

636
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:09,500
<25-13,BECKETT>你确定吗
<25-13,BECKETT>Are you sure?

637
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:12,440
<25-13,BECKETT>看看周围  我猜他就是你雇来
<25-13,BECKETT>Because looking around, i'm guessing he's the guy that you hired

638
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:16,630
<25-13,BECKETT>窃取韦格·詹森火星模拟室的人
<25-13,BECKETT>to steal Viggo Jansen's plans for the mars simulation.

639
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,000
<25-13,BECKETT>探长
<25-13,BECKETT>Detective,

640
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:20,890
<25-14,RASHER>我雇的是世上最好的工程师
<25-14,RASHER>I employ the world's best engineers.

641
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:24,800
<25-14,RASHER>我为什么要浪费时间得到我对手的技术
<25-14,RASHER>Why would I bother wasting my time on my competitor's technology?

642
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:26,850
<25-15,CASTLE>也许因为你在逐渐落后于他
<25-15,CASTLE>Maybe because you're falling behind them.

643
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:29,410
<25-15,CASTLE>众所周知你上两次火箭发射
<25-15,CASTLE>It's no secret your last two rocket launches

644
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:31,470
<25-15,CASTLE>都以悲惨失败告终
<25-15,CASTLE>were spectacular failures.

645
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,400
<25-15,CASTLE>你想要获胜
<25-15,CASTLE>You want to win,

646
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:34,960
<25-15,CASTLE>所以你需要在竞争中占上风
<25-15,CASTLE>so you needed to buy a competitive advantage.

647
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:36,620
<25-16,BECKETT>当詹森的一名队员
<25-16,BECKETT>And after one of Jansen's team members

648
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:37,810
<25-16,BECKETT>发现你的目的时
<25-16,BECKETT>discovered what you were up to --

649
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:40,530
<25-16,BECKETT>对于你这样声望和爵位的人
<25-16,BECKETT>A man with your reputation and knighthood --

650
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:43,030
<25-16,BECKETT>你没得选择  只能杀了他
<25-16,BECKETT>you had no choice but to have him killed.

651
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:44,400
<25-17,RASHER>杀
<25-17,RASHER>Killed?

652
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:46,890
<25-17,RASHER>谁被杀了
<25-17,RASHER>Who was killed?

653
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,910
<25-18,BECKETT>詹森手下的一个宇航员汤姆·里奇伍德
<25-18,BECKETT>One of Jansen's astronauts -- Tom Richwood.

654
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,640
<25-19,RASHER>我和这件事没有关联
<25-19,RASHER>I had nothing to do with that.

655
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,060
<25-20,BECKETT>要让我相信你
<25-20,BECKETT>Well, the best way to convince me of that

656
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:57,240
<25-20,BECKETT>就告诉我格兰杰在哪里
<25-20,BECKETT>is to tell me where Granger is.

657
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:00,780
<25-20,BECKETT>除非你更想入狱
<25-20,BECKETT>unless you prefer prison.

658
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:07,660
<26-1,GRANGER>对  我是伊恩爵士派的间谍
<26-1,GRANGER>Okay, yeah... I was spying for Sir Ian.

659
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:10,970
<26-1,GRANGER>他承诺事成之后让我当他团队的驾驶员
<26-1,GRANGER>He promised me the pilot slot on his mission if I did.

660
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:12,710
<26-1,GRANGER>但关于汤姆的事我没有撒谎
<26-1,GRANGER>But I was telling the truth about Tom.

661
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,680
<26-1,GRANGER>他不是我杀的
<26-1,GRANGER>I didn't kill him.

662
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:14,890
<26-1,GRANGER>我有不在场证明  不是吗
<26-1,GRANGER>I have an alibi, remember?

663
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,330
<26-2,BECKETT>不在场证明是可以伪造的
<26-2,BECKETT>Alibis can be bought.

664
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,510
<26-2,BECKETT>我们在防毒面具上发现了你的DNA
<26-2,BECKETT>We found your DNA on the gas mask.

665
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,790
<26-2,BECKETT>我们知道通道里的是你
<26-2,BECKETT>We know it was you in the access way.

666
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,870
<26-3,GRANGER>因为我不想事情看起来
<26-3,GRANGER>Because I didn't want it to look like

667
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,550
<26-3,GRANGER>和我有牵连
<26-3,GRANGER>I had anything to do with this.

668
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:26,020
<26-3,GRANGER>我去是为了确保我没有留下任何物证
<26-3,GRANGER>I went to make sure that I hadn't left anything there

669
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:27,220
<26-3,GRANGER>能让你们追查到我
<26-3,GRANGER>that could point back to me.

670
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:28,290
<26-4,BECKETT>比如凶器吗
<26-4,BECKETT>Like the murder weapon?

671
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,860
<26-5,GRANGER>你们真觉得如果是我杀了汤姆
<26-5,GRANGER>Oh, come on. If I killed Tom, do you really think

672
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:32,150
<26-5,GRANGER>我会傻到把凶器留在那儿吗
<26-5,GRANGER>I'd be stupid enough to leave the murder weapon there?

673
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:35,510
<26-5,GRANGER>再说  我根本没进过模拟室
<26-5,GRANGER>Besides, I was never inside the simulation.

674
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,280
<26-5,GRANGER>那太冒险了
<26-5,GRANGER>That would've been way too risky.

675
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:39,160
<26-5,GRANGER>太容易被发现
<26-5,GRANGER>Too many opportunities to get caught.

676
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:40,810
<26-6,BECKETT>那为什么要用防毒面具
<26-6,BECKETT>Then why the gas mask?

677
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:42,300
<26-7,GRANGER>那只是个预防措施
<26-7,GRANGER>It was a precaution.

678
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:45,850
<26-7,GRANGER>我并不是要用那个通道进去
<26-7,GRANGER>I wasn't using the tunnel to get in.

679
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:48,300
<26-7,GRANGER>那是个交接点
<26-7,GRANGER>It was a drop point.

680
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:51,660
<26-8,BECKETT>有人和你里应外合
<26-8,BECKETT>You were working with someone on the inside.

681
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,250
<26-9,GRANGER>我需要资源  而他需要钱
<26-9,GRANGER>I needed access. He needed money.

682
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:55,410
<26-9,GRANGER>所以我们达成了交易
<26-9,GRANGER>So we struck a deal.

683
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:57,150
<26-9,GRANGER>他帮我下载方案图纸和规划
<26-9,GRANGER>He'd download schematics and plans

684
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,790
<26-9,GRANGER>然后放在通道里
<26-9,GRANGER>and drop them for me in the tunnel.

685
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,990
<26-10,BECKETT>是谁
<26-10,BECKETT>Who?

686
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:03,850
<26-12,BECKETT>-米哈伊尔·丹科夫  -那个宇航员
<26-12,BECKETT>- Mikhail Dankov. - The astronaut?

687
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,790
<26-13,GRANGER>如果汤姆发现了他  那或许他就是凶手
<26-13,GRANGER>If Tom was onto him, then maybe he's your killer.

688
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,240
<26-14,BECKETT>我们查过他的追踪器
<26-14,BECKETT>We checked his tracker.

689
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:10,140
<26-14,BECKETT>凶案发生时他在栖息地
<26-14,BECKETT>He was inside the habitat at the time of the murder.

690
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:12,470
<26-15,GRANGER>米哈伊尔知道如果他的行踪被记录的话
<26-15,GRANGER>Mikhail knew if his movements were being recorded,

691
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,370
<26-15,GRANGER>他就无法为我们的所作所为逃避惩罚
<26-15,GRANGER>he'd never get away with what we were doing.

692
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:16,350
<26-15,GRANGER>所以他打败了系统
<26-15,GRANGER>So he beat the system.

693
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:19,760
<26-15,GRANGER>他在植入追踪器之前就克隆了数据
<26-15,GRANGER>He cloned his tracker before they embedded it under his skin.

694
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:24,160
<26-15,GRANGER>只要没人发现  他可以在任何时间溜出去
<26-15,GRANGER>As long as no one was looking, he could slip out at any time.

695
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,270
<27-1,ESPOSITO>米哈伊尔
<27-1,ESPOSITO>Mikhail?

696
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,270
<27-2,MIKHAIL>什么事
<27-2,MIKHAIL>Yes?

697
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,050
<27-3,ESPOSITO>我想和你谈谈
<27-3,ESPOSITO>I'd like a few words with you.

698
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:38,560
<27-4,MIKHAIL>谈什么
<27-4,MIKHAIL>What about?

699
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:42,160
<27-5,ESPOSITO>你和克林特·格兰杰的合作关系
<27-5,ESPOSITO>Your business relationship with Clint Granger.

700
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:53,250
<27-7,ESPOSITO>别这样米哈伊尔  你疯了
<27-7,ESPOSITO>Come on, Mikhail. You're crazy!

701
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:57,420
<27-7,ESPOSITO>哥们儿  你能跑哪去  你在火星呢
<27-7,ESPOSITO>Bro, where you gonna run? You're on mars!

702
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:12,470
<28-1,MIKHAIL>虽然我不想承认  但是出来的感觉真好
<28-1,MIKHAIL>I hate to admit, but it's good to be out.

703
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:14,070
<28-2,ESPOSITO>继续
<28-2,ESPOSITO>Go ahead.

704
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,150
<28-3,MIKHAIL>大家怎么说来着  新鲜空气  时代广场
<28-3,MIKHAIL>What do they say? Fresh air, times square?

705
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,430
<28-4,ESPOSITO>经历过火星模拟室  监狱应该是小菜一碟了吧
<28-4,ESPOSITO>Well, after the mars simulation, prison should be a breeze.

706
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:23,430
<28-5,MIKHAIL>我是在贩卖信息  多大的事儿啊
<28-5,MIKHAIL>So I was trading information. Big deal.

707
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:26,100
<28-5,MIKHAIL>我去火星之后就再也不回来了
<28-5,MIKHAIL>I was leaving the planet and never coming back.

708
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:29,010
<28-5,MIKHAIL>我要确保我的家人受到好的照料
<28-5,MIKHAIL>I wanted to make sure my family was taken care of.

709
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:30,380
<28-6,ESPOSITO>真高尚
<28-6,ESPOSITO>Oh, noble.

710
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:33,480
<28-7,MIKHAIL>你们老美啊  一点点金钱交易无伤大雅
<28-7,MIKHAIL>You Americans. A little corruption never hurt anyone.

711
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:35,260
<28-8,BECKETT>我不认为汤姆会赞同
<28-8,BECKETT>I don't think Tom would agree.

712
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:38,150
<28-8,BECKETT>汤姆  汤姆是个浑蛋
<28-8,BECKETT>Tom? Tom was jackass.

713
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:41,360
<28-9,MIKHAIL>所有人都受不了他克扣粮食供给
<28-9,MIKHAIL>Drove everyone crazy the way he doled out food and supplies

714
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:44,870
<28-9,MIKHAIL>还用每个人细小的错误来建立影响力
<28-9,MIKHAIL>and tried to leverage everyone for making even tiniest error.

715
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,130
<28-9,MIKHAIL>相信我  大家可能不敢说出来
<28-9,MIKHAIL>Trust me, they may be scared to say it,

716
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:49,240
<28-9,MIKHAIL>但没人为他的死感到伤心
<28-9,MIKHAIL>but no one's sad he's dead.

717
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:52,320
<28-9,MIKHAIL>没有人期待在另一个星球
<28-9,MIKHAIL>No one was looking forward to spending rest of lives

718
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:54,100
<28-9,MIKHAIL>和他共度余生
<28-9,MIKHAIL>with him on other planet.

719
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:56,790
<28-10,BECKETT>但你是唯一一个在他被谋杀时下落不明的
<28-10,BECKETT>And yet, you are the only one that is unaccounted for

720
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,220
<28-10,BECKETT>也就是说
<28-10,BECKETT>during his murder,

721
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:01,540
<28-10,BECKETT>你是唯一一个能杀死他的人
<28-10,BECKETT>which means you are the only one that could've killed him.

722
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,690
<28-11,MIKHAIL>不  我不是
<28-11,MIKHAIL>Mm, no. I could not.

723
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,010
<28-11,MIKHAIL>我能证明案发时我在哪儿
<28-11,MIKHAIL>I can prove where I was during the murder.

724
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:09,930
<28-12,BECKETT>怎么证明
<28-12,BECKETT>How?

725
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:12,370
<28-13,MIKHAIL>金指挥官让我去工程区时
<28-13,MIKHAIL>When commander Kim sent me down to engineering,

726
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:15,060
<28-13,MIKHAIL>我用仅有的时间拍照片
<28-13,MIKHAIL>I used rare time alone to take pictures

727
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:18,430
<28-13,MIKHAIL>在生命补给处帮格兰杰下载图纸
<28-13,MIKHAIL>and download schematics from life support to give to Granger.

728
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:20,850
<28-13,MIKHAIL>存有所有照片的内存盘还在我这里
<28-13,MIKHAIL>I still have the drive with all of my photos.

729
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:23,700
<28-13,MIKHAIL>照片上标有时间
<28-13,MIKHAIL>They're time-stamped with the mission clock.

730
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:29,450
<28-14,ESPOSITO>你的不在场证明是当时你在为格兰杰窃取信息
<28-14,ESPOSITO>So, your alibi is that you were spying for Granger?

731
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,410
<28-15,MIKHAIL>去看我的照片你们就知道了
<28-15,MIKHAIL>Go. Look at my photos. You'll see.

732
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:40,000
<29-1,RYAN>我翻阅了米哈伊尔的所有照片
<29-1,RYAN>So, I went through all of Mikhail's photos

733
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:41,950
<29-1,RYAN>从汤姆被杀的那个晚上开始
<29-1,RYAN>from the night Tom was murdered.

734
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:46,540
<29-1,RYAN>他没有说谎
<29-1,RYAN>As you can see, he's telling the truth.

735
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,090
<29-1,RYAN>看到他的镜像了吗
<29-1,RYAN>See his reflection?

736
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,150
<29-1,RYAN>是的
<29-1,RYAN>Yeah.

737
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:52,330
<29-2,CASTLE>时间模块确认了时间
<29-2,CASTLE>And the module clock confirms the time.

738
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,830
<29-3,BECKETT>他可能仿制了时间
<29-3,BECKETT>Maybe he faked the time,

739
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,190
<29-3,BECKETT>要不整件事都是格兰杰做的
<29-3,BECKETT>or maybe it was Granger after all.

740
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,750
<29-4,CASTLE>不是格兰杰  莱恩  前一张
<29-4,CASTLE>It wasn't Granger. Uh, Ryan, go back.

741
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,310
<29-4,CASTLE>就是这张
<29-4,CASTLE>To -- there, now...

742
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:03,630
<29-4,CASTLE>放大窗户
<29-4,CASTLE>Zoom in on the window.

743
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:06,780
<29-4,CASTLE>看右下方
<29-4,CASTLE>Look down on the bottom right.

744
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,140
<29-5,RYAN>那是探测车吗
<29-5,RYAN>Is that the rover?

745
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:12,460
<29-6,BECKETT>我以为计算机记载
<29-6,BECKETT>I thought the computer said

746
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:13,950
<29-6,BECKETT>谋杀时它处于停靠状态
<29-6,BECKETT>that it was docked during the murder.

747
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,380
<29-7,CASTLE>很显然  计算机弄错了
<29-7,CASTLE>Clearly, the computer was wrong.

748
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:17,700
<29-7,CASTLE>放大探测车的机械臂
<29-7,CASTLE>Now, uh, push in on the Rover's arm.

749
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:19,430
<29-7,CASTLE>滤掉其他反射图像
<29-7,CASTLE>Filter out some of that reflection.

750
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:25,100
<29-8,BECKETT>是那把螺丝刀
<29-8,BECKETT>It's the screwdriver.

751
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:28,470
<29-9,CASTLE>那就是拿着凶器的凶手
<29-9,CASTLE>There's your killer holding the murder weapon.

752
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,550
<29-9,CASTLE>是探测车干的
<29-9,CASTLE>The Rover did it.

753
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:36,820
<30-1,JANSEN>探测车开出去了  不对啊
<30-1,JANSEN>The rover was out? This can't be right.

754
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:38,430
<30-1,JANSEN>米拉的所有数据都显示
<30-1,JANSEN>All the data from M.I.R.A. indicates

755
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,490
<30-1,JANSEN>汤姆被杀时  探测车处于停靠状态
<30-1,JANSEN>that the rover was docked when Tom was killed.

756
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,890
<30-2,CASTLE>数据弄错了
<30-2,CASTLE>I'd say the data's wrong.

757
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,730
<30-2,CASTLE>根据你的文献
<30-2,CASTLE>And according to your literature,

758
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,190
<30-2,CASTLE>那辆探测车有着能够
<30-2,CASTLE>that rover has the speed and dexterity

759
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,990
<30-2,CASTLE>精准杀人的速度和灵巧度
<30-2,CASTLE>to kill with mathematical precision.

760
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,980
<30-3,BECKETT>詹森先生  都有谁能够操控探测车
<30-3,BECKETT>Mr. Jansen, who has access to the rover controls?

761
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:52,700
<30-3,BECKETT>宇航员吗  或是控制中心的人
<30-3,BECKETT>One of your astronauts? Someone at mission control?

762
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:54,320
<30-3,BECKETT>没人能操控
<30-3,BECKETT>No one has access.

763
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:57,300
<30-4,JANSEN>探测车是很复杂的机械设备
<30-4,JANSEN>The rover is an extremely complex piece of equipment.

764
00:30:57,310 --> 00:31:00,160
<30-4,JANSEN>人工操作  太容易出错
<30-4,JANSEN>Under human control, there's too high a margin for error,

765
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:02,810
<30-4,JANSEN>所以我们将其设计为只能通过计算机控制
<30-4,JANSEN>So we designed it to interface solely with the computer.

766
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:05,770
<30-4,JANSEN>我们的宇航员描述其想要完成的任务
<30-4,JANSEN>Our astronauts describe the sort of task they want carried out,

767
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,440
<30-4,JANSEN>米拉负责执行
<30-4,JANSEN>and M.I.R.A. executes it.

768
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:10,250
<30-5,CASTLE>有没有可能某人要求她杀死汤姆
<30-5,CASTLE>Is it possible someone could have asked her to kill Tom?

769
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:15,840
<30-6,JANSEN>米拉不会执行那种命令的
<30-6,JANSEN>M.I.R.A. wouldn't comply with that sort of command.

770
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,530
<30-6,JANSEN>但这不太对劲
<30-6,JANSEN>But something's wrong.

771
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:20,970
<30-6,JANSEN>我需要跟她谈谈
<30-6,JANSEN>I need to talk to her.

772
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:23,350
<30-7,BECKET>能不能找个私密的地方谈
<30-7,BECKET>Well, is there somewhere we can do that privately

773
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,730
<30-7,BECKET>不被他人偷听的地方
<30-7,BECKET>without anyone hearing?

774
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:27,360
<30-8,JANSEN>有  模拟室中的计算机模块舱
<30-8,JANSEN>Yeah, the computer-module pod inside the sim.

775
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:37,990
<31-1,KIM>怎么了
<31-1,KIM>What's going on?

776
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,300
<31-2,JANSEN>很快就会让你知道
<31-2,JANSEN>I'll let you know soon.

777
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:53,160
<31-2,JANSEN>这里
<31-2,JANSEN>In here.

778
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:01,690
<31-2,JANSEN>好了
<31-2,JANSEN>There.

779
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,050
<32-1,JANSEN>我切断了与栖息地其他人的通讯
<32-1,JANSEN>I've cut off communications with the rest of the habitat.

780
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,370
<32-2,JANSEN>没人能听见我们
<32-2,JANSEN>No one can hear us.

781
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:08,360
<32-3,MIRA>是你吗  詹森博士
<32-3,MIRA>Is that you, Dr. Jansen?

782
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:09,650
<32-4,JANSEN>是的  米拉
<32-4,JANSEN>Yes, M.I.R.A.

783
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:11,670
<32-5,MIRA>你来火星干什么  博士
<32-5,MIRA>What are you doing on Mars, doctor?

784
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,230
<32-6,JANSEN>我来跟你谈谈
<32-6,JANSEN>I came to talk to you.

785
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,940
<32-6,JANSEN>你还记得贝克特探长和理查德·卡塞尔吧
<32-6,JANSEN>You remember Detective Beckett and Richard Castle.

786
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:18,210
<32-7,MIRA>当然  有什么需要帮忙的
<32-7,MIRA>Of course. How can I help you?

787
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:20,780
<32-8,BECKETT>我们是要审问计算机吗
<32-8,BECKETT>Are we seriously about to interrogate a computer?

788
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:22,830
<32-9,MIRA>探长  "审问"一词暗示
<32-9,MIRA>Detective, the word "Interrogate"

789
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,040
<32-9,MIRA>你认为我做错了什么事
<32-9,MIRA>implies you believe I am guilty of something.

790
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:27,070
<32-9,MIRA>你认为我做错了什么
<32-9,MIRA>Of what do you think I am guilty?

791
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,050
<32-10,CASTLE>至少她没有请律师
<32-10,CASTLE>Well, at least she's not asking for a lawyer.

792
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:31,260
<32-10,CASTLE>米拉
<32-10,CASTLE>M.I.R.A.,

793
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:33,350
<32-11,BECKETT>我们想知道  汤姆·里奇伍德被杀时
<32-11,BECKETT>we'd like to know where the rover was

794
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,130
<32-11,BECKETT>探测车在哪里
<32-11,BECKETT>when Tom Richwood was killed.

795
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:37,810
<32-12,MIRA>我已经把这个讯息给你了  探长
<32-12,MIRA>I already gave you that information, Detective.

796
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:39,160
<32-12,MIRA>探测车处于停靠状态
<32-12,MIRA>The rover was docked.

797
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:41,450
<32-13,JANSEN>米拉  我们知道探测车并未停靠
<32-13,JANSEN>M.I.R.A., we know the rover wasn't docked.

798
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,560
<32-14,MIRA>你们怎么知道的
<32-14,MIRA>How do you know?

799
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:47,150
<32-15,JANSEN>我们有照片  证据
<32-15,JANSEN>We have photographs, evidence.

800
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,060
<32-16,MIRA>你们的证据有误
<32-16,MIRA>Your evidence is incorrect.

801
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:50,790
<32-16,MIRA>探测车处于停靠状态
<32-16,MIRA>The rover was docked.

802
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:53,500
<32-17,BECKETT>米拉  在汤姆死前
<32-17,BECKETT>M.I.R.A., prior to Tom's death,

803
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:56,200
<32-17,BECKETT>有人指示你启动探测车吗
<32-17,BECKETT>did someone instruct you to activate the rover?

804
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:00,860
<32-18,JANSEN>她在使用更多的电力  不对劲
<32-18,JANSEN>She's drawing more power. Something's wrong.

805
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:03,850
<32-19,MIRA>不  探测车并未启动
<32-19,MIRA>No. The rover wasn't activated.

806
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,410
<32-19,MIRA>探测车处于停靠状态
<32-19,MIRA>The rover was docked.

807
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,800
<32-20,CASTLE>有可能是他人篡改了她的存储吗
<32-20,CASTLE>Is it possible someone could have altered her memory?

808
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:10,330
<32-21,MIRA>没人篡改我的存储  卡塞尔先生
<32-21,MIRA>No one altered my memory, Mr. Castle.

809
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:12,210
<32-21,MIRA>我的存储很好
<32-21,MIRA>My memory is perfect.

810
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:14,860
<32-22,JANSEN>她存储核心被设计成封闭系统
<32-22,JANSEN>Her memory core was designed to be a closed system.

811
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:17,360
<32-22,JANSEN>无法被篡改  但出了什么问题
<32-22,JANSEN>It can't be altered, but something's off.

812
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:20,370
<32-22,JANSEN>米拉  在所有系统运行一级诊断程序
<32-22,JANSEN>M.I.R.A., run a level-one diagnostic on all systems.

813
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:22,930
<32-23,MIRA>没必要运行诊断程序
<32-23,MIRA>There is no need to run a diagnostic.

814
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:25,490
<32-23,MIRA>所有系统都处于最佳状态
<32-23,MIRA>All systems are optimal.

815
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,540
<32-24,JANSEN>那也运行一遍  好吗
<32-24,JANSEN>How about we run it anyway?

816
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:30,390
<32-25,MIRA>抱歉  我做不到
<32-25,MIRA>I'm sorry. I can't do that.

817
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,080
<32-26,JANSEN>为什么
<32-26,JANSEN>Why not?

818
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:33,610
<32-27,MIRA>那样做违背我的运行参数
<32-27,MIRA>It violates my operational parameters.

819
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:36,510
<32-28,JANSEN>只是简单的诊断程序  违背了什么参数
<32-28,JANSEN>It's a simple diagnostic. What parameter does it violate?

820
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,350
<32-29,MIRA>那会危害整个任务
<32-29,MIRA>It will compromise the mission.

821
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:41,100
<32-30,JANSEN>诊断程序怎么会危害整个任务
<32-30,JANSEN>How will a diagnostic compromise the mission?!

822
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:43,860
<32-31,MIRA>回答这个问题会危害整个任务
<32-31,MIRA>Answering that question will compromise the mission.

823
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:45,570
<32-32,JANSEN>-我不明白  -我明白
<32-32,JANSEN>- I don't understand. - I think I do.

824
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:46,850
<32-33,BECKETT>她知道她在说谎
<32-33,BECKETT>She knows she's lying to us,

825
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,400
<32-33,BECKETT>如果她运行诊断程序
<32-33,BECKETT>and if she runs those diagnostics,

826
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:49,790
<32-33,BECKETT>我们就会发现真相
<32-33,BECKETT>we'll discover the truth.

827
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,270
<32-34,CASTLE>真相会危害到整个任务
<32-34,CASTLE>And that truth will somehow put the mission at risk.

828
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,640
<32-35,JANSEN>她是台机器  她不会说谎
<32-35,JANSEN>She's a machine. She can't lie.

829
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:56,300
<32-36,CASTLE>你说过她被编程拥有学习能力
<32-36,CASTLE>You said that she's programmed to learn.

830
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:57,720
<32-36,CASTLE>如果有人教她说谎呢
<32-36,CASTLE>What if somebody taught her how?

831
00:33:57,730 --> 00:33:59,660
<32-36,CASTLE>如果有人利用她来杀人
<32-36,CASTLE>What if someone used her to kill

832
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:01,320
<32-36,CASTLE>然后利用她掩盖罪行
<32-36,CASTLE>and then to help cover up the crime?

833
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:03,180
<32-37,JANSEN>不  她的核心参数是无法被修改的
<32-37,JANSEN>No, her core parameters can't be altered.

834
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:06,040
<32-37,JANSEN>她被编程保护整个任务以及参与任务的每个人
<32-37,JANSEN>She's programmed to protect the mission and everyone on it.

835
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:07,070
<32-38,CASTLE>但如果那些运行参数
<32-38,CASTLE>But what if those operational parameters are

836
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,110
<32-38,CASTLE>彼此矛盾呢
<32-38,CASTLE>in conflict with each other?

837
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,880
<32-38,CASTLE>如果她需要保护的人
<32-38,CASTLE>What if someone she's programmed to protect

838
00:34:11,890 --> 00:34:13,510
<32-38,CASTLE>对整个任务是个威胁呢
<32-38,CASTLE>is a threat to the mission?

839
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:16,980
<32-38,CASTLE>米拉  你对汤姆·里奇伍德如何看待
<32-38,CASTLE>Um, M.I.R.A., how would you classify Tom Richwood?

840
00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:18,810
<32-39,MIRA>汤姆·里奇伍德军士长
<32-39,MIRA>Sergeant Major Tom Richwood,

841
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:21,190
<32-39,MIRA>驾驶员  系统工程专家
<32-39,MIRA>pilot, systems engineering specialist.

842
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,910
<32-40,CASTLE>-好  好  -已死亡
<32-40,CASTLE>- Right. Right, okay. Um... - Deceased.

843
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:25,120
<32-42,CASTLE>汤姆对整个任务是个威胁吗
<32-42,CASTLE>Was Tom a threat to the mission?

844
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:27,690
<32-43,MIRA>是的
<32-43,MIRA>Yes.

845
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:31,550
<32-43,MIRA>为什么
<32-43,MIRA>Why?

846
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:34,840
<32-44,JANSEN>是谁告诉你汤姆是个威胁的
<32-44,JANSEN>Who told you Tom was a threat?

847
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:35,740
<32-25,MIRA>抱歉
<32-25,MIRA>I'm sorry.

848
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:38,380
<32-45,MIRA>我未经授权给予你此讯息
<32-45,MIRA>I'm not authorized to give you that information.

849
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:39,300
<32-46,CASTLE>因为在她的系统中
<32-46,CASTLE>Because in her mind,

850
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:41,780
<32-46,CASTLE>那个讯息会危害整个任务
<32-46,CASTLE>that information would be a threat to the mission.

851
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:43,380
<32-47,BECKETT>肯定还有其他办法找出真相
<32-47,BECKETT>There's got to be another way to find out.

852
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:44,430
<32-47,BECKETT>有
<32-47,BECKETT>There is.

853
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:46,460
<32-48,JANSEN>我可以重启她
<32-48,JANSEN>I can reboot her.

854
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,260
<32-48,JANSEN>她所有学到的东西都会被消除
<32-48,JANSEN>Everything she's learned will be wiped,

855
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,760
<32-48,JANSEN>但储存的内容都会得以保存
<32-48,JANSEN>but all recorded memory will stay intact.

856
00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:54,830
<32-48,JANSEN>我们很快就会知道到底发生了什么
<32-48,JANSEN>We can find out pretty quickly what happened.

857
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,010
<32-49,CASTLE>那是什么
<32-49,CASTLE>What's that?

858
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,640
<32-50,JANSEN>有人打开了与外界连接的通气口
<32-50,JANSEN>Someone's opened the vents to the outside!

859
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:01,490
<32-50,JANSEN>我们暴露在外界空气中了
<32-50,JANSEN>We're taking in atmosphere!

860
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:05,620
<32-51,CASTLE>是米拉  她在试图保护自己
<32-51,CASTLE>It's M.I.R.A. She's trying to protect herself.

861
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:08,310
<32-52,JANSEN>不  米拉  回答我
<32-52,JANSEN>No! M.I.R.A., don't shut me out!

862
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,960
<32-53,BECKETT>你说这有害  但不会杀死我们
<32-53,BECKETT>You said that this was harmful but it wouldn't kill us, right?

863
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:12,570
<32-54,JANSEN>短期不会  长期暴露其中是致命的
<32-54,JANSEN>Short term -- long term, it's deadly!

864
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:13,980
<32-54,JANSEN>我们得出去
<32-54,JANSEN>We have to get out of here!

865
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,090
<32-55,BECKETT>锁住了
<32-55,BECKETT>It's locked!

866
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:18,300
<32-55,BECKETT>求助
<32-55,BECKETT>Call for help!

867
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:19,940
<32-56,JANSEN>通讯切断了
<32-56,JANSEN>Communications are dead!

868
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:22,500
<32-57,CASTLE>米拉  开门
<32-57,CASTLE>M.I.R.A., open the door!

869
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:25,250
<32-57,CASTLE>打开舱门
<32-57,CASTLE>Open the pod bay door!

870
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:32,940
<33-1,CASTLE>我想去火星
<33-1,CASTLE>I wanted to go to mars...

871
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:34,360
<33-1,CASTLE>不是死在火星上
<33-1,CASTLE>not die on mars.

872
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:42,160
<33-2,BECKETT>等下  我们不是在火星上
<33-2,BECKETT>Wait a minute. We're not on mars.

873
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:44,140
<33-2,BECKETT>我们在地球上
<33-2,BECKETT>We're on earth.

874
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:50,020
<33-3,ESPOSITO>喂
<33-3,ESPOSITO>Hello?

875
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:51,930
<33-3,ESPOSITO>贝克特
<33-3,ESPOSITO>Beckett?

876
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,990
<34-1,ESPOSITO>你是说电脑试图杀死你们吗
<34-1,ESPOSITO>Are you saying that the computer tried to kill you?

877
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,210
<34-2,CASTLE>就像《2001太空漫游》
<34-2,CASTLE>Yeah, just like in "2001."

878
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,570
<34-2,CASTLE>库布里克没弄错
<34-2,CASTLE>Kubrick was right.

879
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:00,630
<34-2,CASTLE>人工智能不是个好主意
<34-2,CASTLE>A.I. is a bad idea.

880
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,050
<34-2,CASTLE>米拉不是人工智能
<34-2,CASTLE>M.I.R.A.'s not A.I.

881
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:05,190
<34-3,JANSEN>是的  她能学习  适应  但她是机器
<34-3,JANSEN>Yes, she can learn and adapt, but she's a machine.

882
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,780
<34-3,JANSEN>她无法自我思考
<34-3,JANSEN>She cannot think for herself.

883
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:08,130
<34-4,CASTLE>那她为什么要杀死我们
<34-4,CASTLE>Then why'd she try to kill us?

884
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,450
<34-4,CASTLE>那不是米拉
<34-4,CASTLE>It wasn't M.I.R.A.

885
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:11,170
<34-5,ED>我们刚刚断开了服务器
<34-5,ED>We just pulled apart the server.

886
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:14,170
<34-5,ED>有人在重启系统中附加了一个子程序
<34-5,ED>Someone embedded a subroutine into the O.S. reset program.

887
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:15,750
<34-6,RYAN>一旦你们试图重启她
<34-6,RYAN>The moment that you tried to reboot her,

888
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,430
<34-6,RYAN>子程序启动  将你们困在里面
<34-6,RYAN>that subroutine activated, trapping you guys inside.

889
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:21,060
<34-7,ED>它同时触发了米拉存储电路的倾卸
<34-7,ED>It also triggered a dump of M.I.R.A.'s memory circuits.

890
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:23,370
<34-7,ED>所有的任务数据都没了
<34-7,ED>All the mission data is gone.

891
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:25,390
<34-8,BECKETT>那么这是幕后黑手
<34-8,BECKETT>So this was a failsafe

892
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,400
<34-8,BECKETT>安装的故障保护
<34-8,BECKETT>installed by whoever was behind this.

893
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:30,240
<34-8,BECKETT>我们本不该发现探测车或是米拉的异样
<34-8,BECKETT>We were never meant to find out about the rover or M.I.R.A.,

894
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:31,320
<34-8,BECKETT>万一我们发现了
<34-8,BECKETT>and on the off chance that we did,

895
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:33,710
<34-8,BECKETT>凶手希望我们不会更近一步
<34-8,BECKETT>the killer wanted to make sure we didn't get any further.

896
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,620
<34-9,CASTLE>通过杀死唯一的证人
<34-9,CASTLE>By killing the only witness --

897
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:37,380
<34-9,CASTLE>米拉和她的存储体
<34-9,CASTLE>M.I.R.A. and her memory banks.

898
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:39,170
<34-10,JANSEN>肯定是某个宇航员干的
<34-10,JANSEN>It has to be one of the astronauts.

899
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:41,460
<34-10,JANSEN>他们是唯一能安放子程序的人
<34-10,JANSEN>They're the only ones who could've planted that subroutine,

900
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:43,170
<34-10,JANSEN>也是唯一能说服米拉
<34-10,JANSEN>the only ones who could've convince M.I.R.A.

901
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,050
<34-10,JANSEN>汤姆是个威胁的人
<34-10,JANSEN>that Tom was a threat.

902
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:46,330
<34-11,BECKETT>但是存储内容无法恢复
<34-11,BECKETT>Yeah, but with the memory data unrecoverable,

903
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:48,060
<34-11,BECKETT>我们没法知道到底是谁
<34-11,BECKETT>it's impossible to know which one.

904
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:50,370
<34-12,CASTLE>不  有办法
<34-12,CASTLE>No. Not impossible.

905
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:51,670
<34-12,CASTLE>事实上
<34-12,CASTLE>As a matter of fact,

906
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,980
<34-12,CASTLE>只有一个解释说得通
<34-12,CASTLE>there's only one explanation that makes sense.

907
00:36:58,190 --> 00:36:59,550
<35-1,KIM>你在开玩笑吧
<35-1,KIM>You can't be serious.

908
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,010
<35-1,KIM>你认为我们中的某人是凶手
<35-1,KIM>You think one of us is the killer?

909
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:03,590
<35-2,CASTLE>这几乎是完美犯罪
<35-2,CASTLE>And it was almost the perfect crime.

910
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,070
<35-2,CASTLE>凶手只需要一个替罪羊
<35-2,CASTLE>All the mastermind needed was someone to pin it on,

911
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,650
<35-2,CASTLE>米哈伊尔刚好派上用场
<35-2,CASTLE>and that's where Mikhail came in.

912
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:08,530
<35-3,BECKETT>凶手一定是发现
<35-3,BECKETT>The killer must've found out

913
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:10,480
<35-3,BECKETT>米哈伊尔在倒卖商业机密
<35-3,BECKETT>that Mikhail was selling secrets,

914
00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:12,600
<35-3,BECKETT>使他成为最完美的替罪羊
<35-3,BECKETT>which made him the perfect patsy.

915
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:13,840
<35-4,CASTLE>凶手只需确保
<35-4,CASTLE>All they had to do was make sure

916
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:16,220
<35-4,CASTLE>米哈伊尔在汤姆被杀时没有不在场证明就行
<35-4,CASTLE>that Mikhail was unaccounted for during Tom's murder.

917
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:19,100
<35-4,CASTLE>再就是把凶器安放在他的交接点
<35-4,CASTLE>That and plant the weapon at his drop-off point.

918
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:20,500
<35-5,BECKETT>一石两鸟
<35-5,BECKETT>Killing two birds with one stone --

919
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:21,930
<35-5,BECKETT>人见人恨的汤姆
<35-5,BECKETT>Tom, whom everybody hated,

920
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,490
<35-5,BECKETT>和倒卖机密的米哈伊尔
<35-5,BECKETT>and Mikhail, who was selling secrets.

921
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,150
<35-6,CASTLE>于是凶手派米哈伊尔去工程区
<35-6,CASTLE>So they sent Mikhail to engineering,

922
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,240
<35-6,CASTLE>他不会知道所发生的一切
<35-6,CASTLE>where he would be blind to everything that happened.

923
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:28,480
<35-6,CASTLE>可惜他没有待在那
<35-6,CASTLE>Only he didn't stay there.

924
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:30,420
<35-6,CASTLE>他去了生命补给室
<35-6,CASTLE>Instead, he went to life support,

925
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:33,310
<35-6,CASTLE>通过一张照片  就揭露了一切
<35-6,CASTLE>Where, with one photo, he expos everything.

926
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:36,800
<35-7,BECKETT>金指挥官  是你在维修时
<35-7,BECKETT>Commander Kim, it was you who sent Mikhail to engineering

927
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:38,260
<35-7,BECKETT>派米哈伊尔去工程区的
<35-7,BECKETT>during the repair, wasn't it?

928
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:41,340
<35-8,KIM>-是的  但这没什么奇怪的  -的确
<35-8,KIM>- Yes, though there's nothing unusual about that. - No.

929
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:42,510
<35-9,CASTLE>但根据流程
<35-9,CASTLE>But according to procedure,

930
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,540
<35-9,CASTLE>安琪拉不是应该去辅助他吗
<35-9,CASTLE>Isn't Angela supposed to be there backing him up?

931
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:47,770
<35-10,KIM>是的  但我需要她在这里做检查
<35-10,KIM>Yes, but I needed her up here checking protocols.

932
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:49,550
<35-10,KIM>那可不能证明我是凶手
<35-10,KIM>That hardly makes me a murderer.

933
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,020
<35-10,KIM>再说我都没有离开模块舱
<35-10,KIM>And I never even left the module

934
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:54,670
<35-10,KIM>所以我无法在通道中安放杀人凶器
<35-10,KIM>so I...I couldn't have planted the murder weapon in the tunnel.

935
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:55,570
<35-10,KIM>的确
<35-10,KIM>No.

936
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:57,940
<35-11,CASTLE>但是哈伦博士和安琪拉可以做到
<35-11,CASTLE>But Dr. Haroun and Angela could have done that.

937
00:37:57,950 --> 00:38:00,540
<35-12,BECKETT>你俩在外面停留了10分钟
<35-12,BECKETT>The two of you were outside together for 10 minutes.

938
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:02,750
<35-13,HAROUM>是去查看汤姆并恢复供电
<35-13,HAROUM>Yes, checking on Tom and restoring power.

939
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,600
<35-14,CASTLE>那时所有摄像机都停用了
<35-14,CASTLE>While all the cameras were down,

940
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:06,600
<35-14,CASTLE>给了你足够的时间丢弃凶器
<35-14,CASTLE>Giving you enough time to ditch the murder weapon

941
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:09,590
<35-14,CASTLE>并清理探测车上的证据
<35-14,CASTLE>and clean any forensic evidence off the rover.

942
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,940
<35-15,ANGELA>太扯了
<35-15,ANGELA>That's ridiculous.

943
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:13,280
<35-15,ANGELA>你这是要一一列举我们的嫌疑吗
<35-15,ANGELA>Are you just gonna go after us one by one?

944
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:15,130
<35-15,ANGELA>那时我一直跟拉什曼在一起
<35-15,ANGELA>I was with Rusham the whole time.

945
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:16,570
<35-15,ANGELA>他没有接近过探测车
<35-15,ANGELA>He didn't go anywhere near the rover.

946
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:17,810
<35-16,HAROUM>安琪拉也没有
<35-16,HAROUM>And neither did Angela.

947
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:20,870
<35-17,BECKETT>所以才说犯案者很聪明
<35-17,BECKETT>And that's what makes this crime so clever.

948
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:21,850
<35-17,BECKETT>从一开始
<35-17,BECKETT>From the beginning,

949
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:24,100
<35-17,BECKETT>你们三个就一直在给彼此提供不在场证明
<35-17,BECKETT>the three of you have been able to alibi each other out

950
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:27,330
<35-17,BECKETT>因为你们都参与其中
<35-17,BECKETT>because you were all in on it together.

951
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:29,530
<35-18,CASTLE>只有你们三个合谋
<35-18,CASTLE>It would've taken the three of you colluding

952
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:32,010
<35-18,CASTLE>才能说服米拉汤姆会危害整个任务
<35-18,CASTLE>to convince M.I.R.A. that Tom was threatening the mission.

953
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:33,790
<35-19,BECKETT>考虑到你们对汤姆的看法
<35-19,BECKETT>And given the way that you felt about Tom,

954
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,550
<35-19,BECKETT>你们知道汤姆在团队中  一切都会搞砸
<35-19,BECKETT>you knew that the team couldn't survive with him on it.

955
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:40,140
<35-19,BECKETT>他的确是个威胁  尤其是在环境恶劣的星球上
<35-19,BECKETT>He was a threat, especially on a hostile planet.

956
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:42,560
<35-20,CASTLE>于是  在被关在这狭小空间
<35-20,CASTLE>So, after six months of being locked up

957
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,840
<35-20,CASTLE>六个月后  你们决定
<35-20,CASTLE>in this tin can together, you decided

958
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:46,810
<35-20,CASTLE>比起牺牲成为第一批
<35-20,CASTLE>that rather than sacrifice your chance

959
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:50,270
<35-20,CASTLE>踏上火星的人类的机会
<35-20,CASTLE>at being the first human beings to stand on mars,

960
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:54,930
<35-20,CASTLE>还是用一条人命换来永垂不朽更划算
<35-20,CASTLE>you would put your shot at immortality ahead of another man's life.

961
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:57,860
<35-21,KIM>这是个有趣的推理
<35-21,KIM>That's a...fascinating theory,

962
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:00,890
<35-21,KIM>但米拉的存储都没了  你没有证据
<35-21,KIM>But with M.I.R.A.'s memory gone, you have no proof.

963
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,720
<35-22,BECKETT>我们也是这么想的
<35-22,BECKETT>You know, that's what we thought, as well.

964
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:06,590
<35-22,BECKETT>知道詹森博士告知我们米拉的黑盒子
<35-22,BECKETT>Until Dr. Jansen told us about M.I.R.A's black box.

965
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,590
<35-23,CASTLE>由于出现灾难性故障
<35-23,CASTLE>In the event of a catastrophic failure,

966
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:11,290
<35-23,CASTLE>她把她的数据传到了最近的卫星上
<35-23,CASTLE>she pulses all her data to the nearest satellite.

967
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,280
<35-23,CASTLE>你们与她所有的交谈
<35-23,CASTLE>All your conversations with her,

968
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:14,970
<35-23,CASTLE>全部的内容
<35-23,CASTLE>everything you three did,

969
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,750
<35-23,CASTLE>都在上面
<35-23,CASTLE>It's all there.

970
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:20,890
<35-24,BECKETT>坏消息是  你们谁都去不了火星了
<35-24,BECKETT>So, the bad news is, none of you are going to mars.

971
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:21,710
<35-24,BECKETT>好消息是
<35-24,BECKETT>Good news is,

972
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,280
<35-24,BECKETT>第一个老实交代的人
<35-24,BECKETT>the first one to cooperate

973
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:25,290
<35-24,BECKETT>判刑的时间最短
<35-24,BECKETT>will get the least amount of jail time.

974
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:34,440
<36-1,BECKETT>没想到他们这么快就招供了
<36-1,BECKETT>I just didn't expect them to cave that quickly.

975
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:36,880
<36-1,BECKETT>真是个好策略  卡塞尔
<36-1,BECKETT>That was a clever ruse, Castle.

976
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:38,180
<36-2,CASTLE>这招好用真开心
<36-2,CASTLE>I'm just glad it worked.

977
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:39,080
<36-2,CASTLE>如果没成功
<36-2,CASTLE>And if there's not

978
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:41,750
<36-2,CASTLE>真该有个灾难性故障黑匣子卫星
<36-2,CASTLE>a catastrophic-black-box satellite, there should be.

979
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:43,690
<36-2,CASTLE>你认为詹森会怎么做
<36-2,CASTLE>What do you think is gonna happen with Jansen?

980
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:46,230
<36-3,BECKETT>他是业界先锋  梦想家
<36-3,BECKETT>Uh, he's a pioneer. He's a visionary.

981
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,540
<36-3,BECKETT>或许2018年他做不到
<36-3,BECKETT>He may not get there in 2018,

982
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:50,240
<36-3,BECKETT>但我打赌他肯定还是第一个
<36-3,BECKETT>but I'm willing to bet that he's gonna be the first.

983
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:55,400
<36-3,BECKETT>这案子后  你还想去火星吗
<36-3,BECKETT>So, after all of this, you still want to go to Mars?

984
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:56,800
<36-4,CASTLE>当然
<36-4,CASTLE>Oh, of course.

985
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:58,060
<36-4,CASTLE>但我认为我会等到他们有头等舱服务
<36-4,CASTLE>But I think I'm gonna wait till they have

986
00:39:58,070 --> 00:40:00,290
<36-4,CASTLE>到时咱俩一起去
<36-4,CASTLE>first-class service so we can go together.

987
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:02,730
<36-6,CASTLE>你认为
<36-6,CASTLE>Do you think at any point,

988
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:04,510
<36-6,CASTLE>那时候有没有那个宇航员对另一个人说
<36-6,CASTLE>one of those astronauts turned to the others and said,

989
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:07,530
<36-6,CASTLE>"杀掉汤姆可能是个坏主意"
<36-6,CASTLE>"Maybe killing Tom is a really bad idea"?

990
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:09,920
<36-7,BECKETT>我认为当人们被关在密闭空间内
<36-7,BECKETT>I think that when people are stuck together in a small space

991
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:13,590
<36-7,BECKETT>很长时间后  他们就看不清问题了
<36-7,BECKETT>for a long period of time, they lose perspective.

992
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:14,970
<36-7,BECKETT>说到这个
<36-7,BECKETT>Speaking of which,

993
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:17,310
<36-7,BECKETT>不是要召开家庭会议吗
<36-7,BECKETT>Um, wasn't there supposed to be a family meeting tonight?

994
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,370
<36-7,BECKETT>是的
<36-7,BECKETT>There is.

995
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:20,270
<36-8,MARTHA>我告诉阿丽克西斯不用来
<36-8,MARTHA>I told Alexis she did not need to come

996
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:23,540
<36-8,MARTHA>因为我想跟你俩单独谈
<36-8,MARTHA>because I wanted to talk to the two of you alone.

997
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:24,890
<36-8,MARTHA>我知道
<36-8,MARTHA>Now, I know that things

998
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:27,050
<36-8,MARTHA>最近这里比较混乱
<36-8,MARTHA>have been a little frenetic around here,

999
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:28,960
<36-8,MARTHA>阿丽克西斯和她的朋友
<36-8,MARTHA>what with alexis and her friends

1000
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:32,650
<36-8,MARTHA>你俩非常规的作息时间
<36-8,MARTHA>and the two of you in anout at all sorts of odd hours and --

1001
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:34,830
<36-9,CASTLE>别忘了你和你的新男友大晚上唱歌
<36-9,CASTLE>And you and your new boyfriend doing late-night medleys.

1002
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,540
<36-9,CASTLE>是的
<36-9,CASTLE>I -- well, yeah, that.

1003
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:38,540
<36-10,MARTHA>所以我决定
<36-10,MARTHA>So, I have decided --

1004
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:40,480
<36-10,MARTHA>我不想让你俩难过
<36-10,MARTHA>And I don't want to upset either one of you --

1005
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:44,500
<36-10,MARTHA>我决定找一个自己的地方
<36-10,MARTHA>that I am going to look for a place of my own.

1006
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:47,700
<36-11,CASTLE>居住吗
<36-11,CASTLE>To live?

1007
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:48,790
<36-12,MARTHA>是的
<36-12,MARTHA>Well, yes.

1008
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:50,930
<36-12,MARTHA>当然  不是马上搬走
<36-12,MARTHA>I mean, not right away, of course.

1009
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:51,780
<36-12,MARTHA>想找个完美的住处
<36-12,MARTHA>I mean, it's gonna take me a while

1010
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:53,960
<36-12,MARTHA>得花点时间
<36-12,MARTHA>to find exactly the right space.

1011
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:55,460
<36-13,CASTLE>母亲  我只是召开家庭会议
<36-13,CASTLE>Mother, I was just calling a family meeting.

1012
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:56,810
<36-13,CASTLE>没想让你搬走
<36-13,CASTLE>I didn't intend for you to move out.

1013
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:59,230
<36-14,MARTHA>亲爱的  这跟你无关  只跟我有关
<36-14,MARTHA>Darling, this is not about you. Thiss about me.

1014
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,970
<36-14,MARTHA>把这当做是进化吧
<36-14,MARTHA>Think of it as a kind of evolution, you know?

1015
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:06,290
<36-14,MARTHA>我现在事业干得不错
<36-14,MARTHA>I'm -- I'm starting to do very well for myself,

1016
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:09,680
<36-14,MARTHA>我想过不了多久
<36-14,MARTHA>and I am guessing that, uh, before too long,

1017
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:12,580
<36-14,MARTHA>就该有小卡塞尔
<36-14,MARTHA>there's gonna be a few more little Castles,

1018
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:15,110
<36-14,MARTHA>在这里搞破坏了
<36-14,MARTHA>creating havoc around here, and --

1019
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,120
<36-14,MARTHA>我认为你俩
<36-14,MARTHA>And I think the two of you

1020
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:21,140
<36-14,MARTHA>应该独享这里
<36-14,MARTHA>deserve to have this place to yourselves.

1021
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:29,030
<36-15,CASTLE>如果有需要帮忙的事  告诉我
<36-15,CASTLE>Let me know if there's anything I can do.

1022
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,000
<36-16,MARTHA>我会的
<36-16,MARTHA>OH...I will.

1023
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,190
<36-16,MARTHA>好了  我该走了
