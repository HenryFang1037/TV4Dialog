<37-9,ESPOSITO>露西应该告诉我来客人了的
<37-9,ESPOSITO>Lucy, you should have told me we had company.

19
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,340
<2-1,RICHARD CASTLE>那得另花钱
<2-1,RICHARD CASTLE>That costs extra.

20
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,330
<2-2,LUCY>据你的机器朋友说
<2-2,LUCY>Well, according to your little, mechanical friend here,

21
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:39,470
<2-3,MARTHA RODGERS>你一直在用冻匹萨发泄悲伤
<2-3,MARTHA RODGERS>you have been drowning your sorrows in frozen pizza,

22
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:40,740
<2-4,CASTLE>还有网上购物
<2-4,CASTLE>online shopping...

23
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,730
<2-5,LUCY>还连看道夫·龙格尔的电影
<2-5,LUCY>And Dolph Lundgren marathons.

24
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:44,160
<2-6,MARTHA>你也背叛我  露西
<2-6,MARTHA>Et tu, Lucy?

25
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:45,420
<2-7,ALEXIS>没什么隐私可言了吗
<2-7,ALEXIS>Is nothing private?

26
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,760
<2-8,CASTLE>除非你好好设置我
<2-8,CASTLE>Not without the proper setting.

27
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,780
<2-9,LUCY>亲爱的
<2-9,LUCY>Darling, I-I mean,

28
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:49,450
<2-10,MARTHA>我知道跟凯瑟琳分开很艰难
<2-10,MARTHA>I know it's difficult for you without Katherine,

29
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:52,650
<2-10,MARTHA>但现在就喝酒是不是早了点
<2-10,MARTHA>but really, isn't it a little early in the day for this?

30
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:54,470
<2-11,CASTLE>这是给莱恩和埃斯波西托的
<2-11,CASTLE>These are for Ryan and Esposito.

31
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:57,330
<2-11,CASTLE>他们今天拿到警长测试结果
<2-11,CASTLE>They get the results of their sergeant's exam today,

32
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:59,230
<2-11,CASTLE>我想稍后去趟分局
<2-11,CASTLE>So I thought I'd drop down to the precinct,

33
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:00,220
<2-11,CASTLE>给他们个惊喜
<2-11,CASTLE>surprise them a little later on.

34
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,920
<2-12,ALEXIS>如果贝克特恰巧也在
<2-12,ALEXIS>And if Beckett happens to be there...

35
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,620
<2-13,CASTLE>那就更该庆祝了
<2-13,CASTLE>All the more reason to celebrate.

36
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:09,520
<3-1,KATE BECKETT>考试有结果了吗
<3-1,KATE BECKETT>Hey, so, any word on the exam?

37
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:10,270
<3-2,JAVIER ESPOSITO>-别说了  -你要触霉头的
<3-2,JAVIER ESPOSITO>- Stop it. - You're gonna jinx it.

38
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,330
<3-2,JAVIER ESPOSITO>好吧
<3-2,JAVIER ESPOSITO>Okay, okay.

39
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:12,660
<3-3,KEVIN RYAN>不说了
<3-3,KEVIN RYAN>Done.

40
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,720
<3-4,BECKETT>蕾妮
<3-4,BECKETT>Hey, Lanie.

41
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,400
<3-6,BECKETT>这是谁
<3-6,BECKETT>So, who is this?

42
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,110
<3-7,LANIE>贾斯汀·弗莱彻  38岁
<3-7,LANIE>Justin Fletcher, 38.

43
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:20,030
<3-7,LANIE>胸口两处枪伤  近距离开枪
<3-7,LANIE>Two GSWs to the chest, close range.

44
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,270
<3-8,BECKETT>知道案发时间吗
<3-8,BECKETT>Any idea when this happened?

45
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,820
<3-9,LANIE>大概上午10:14左右
<3-9,LANIE>Around 10:14 a.m.

46
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,780
<3-10,BECKETT>好精准啊
<3-10,BECKETT>That's pretty specific.

47
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,790
<3-11,LANIE>911那时接到目击者匿名电话
<3-11,LANIE>That's when 911 received an anonymous call from a witness.

48
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,240
<3-12,RYAN>技术部正在追踪
<3-12,RYAN>Tech's trying to trace it now.

49
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,770
<3-13,BECKETT>那是被害人的车吗
<3-13,BECKETT>So that's our victim's car?

50
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:31,940
<3-14,RYAN>是的  钥匙在兜里
<3-14,RYAN>Yeah. Keys were in his pocket.

51
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:32,710
<3-14,RYAN>我们在查呢
<3-14,RYAN>We're just digging into it.

52
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,660
<3-15,BECKETT>那就不是劫车了
<3-15,BECKETT>Then this wasn't a carjacking.

53
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,830
<3-16,ESPOSITO>也不是抢劫
<3-16,ESPOSITO>Or a robbery.

54
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,740
<3-16,ESPOSITO>被害人的钱包现金还在身上
<3-16,ESPOSITO>Victim still has cash and wallet on him.

55
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,390
<3-17,BECKETT>这都是防弹玻璃啊
<3-17,BECKETT>These are bulletproof windows, huh?

56
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,520
<3-18,ESPOSITO>还不止这一点升级呢
<3-18,ESPOSITO>That's not the only upgrade.

57
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,440
<3-18,ESPOSITO>轮胎是强化防爆轮胎
<3-18,ESPOSITO>These tires are reinforced run-flat,

58
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,530
<3-18,ESPOSITO>门上装有防弹板
<3-18,ESPOSITO>and there are kevlar panels in these doors.

59
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,000
<3-19,BECKETT>怎么样
<3-19,BECKETT>So what do you think?

60
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,840
<3-19,BECKETT>或许是公司安保车
<3-19,BECKETT>Maybe he was corporate security?

61
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,340
<3-20,RYAN>这么小的后座不可能
<3-20,RYAN>Not with that tiny backseat.

62
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,750
<3-21,RYAN>我是说里面容不下人
<3-21,RYAN>I mean, there's no room for a guy to get in there.

63
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,360
<3-24,BECKETT>-我闭嘴了  -好的吧
<3-24,BECKETT>- I'm just gonna stop talking. - Yeah, okay.

64
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:03,840
<3-25,BECKETT>更加精彩了
<3-25,BECKETT>Now the plot thickens.

65
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:08,570
<3-26,BECKETT>埃斯波  让鉴证组来查查吧
<3-26,BECKETT>Espo, why don't you get CSU to sweep this?

66
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:10,470
<3-26,BECKETT>或许他们能查出被害人藏的什么
<3-26,BECKETT>Maybe they can tell us what our victim was hiding here.

67
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,950
<3-27,ESPOSITO>或许他就因此被杀
<3-27,ESPOSITO>Might be what he was killed for.

68
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:15,790
<3-28,LANIE>是考试结果吗
<3-28,LANIE>Is that the test results?

69
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,000
<3-28,LANIE>不是
<3-28,LANIE>No, no.

70
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:21,680
<3-29,RYAN>技术部查到了匿名911电话的姓名住址
<3-29,RYAN>Tech got a name and address on that anonymous 911 call.

71
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,730
<3-29,RYAN>米娅·拉斯洛
<3-29,RYAN>Mia Laszlo.

72
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:24,710
<3-29,RYAN>住在炮台公园
<3-29,RYAN>Address in Battery Park.

73
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:26,100
<3-30,BECKETT>好了  去找她
<3-30,BECKETT>All right, pick her up.

74
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,020
<4-1,MIA>谁
<4-1,MIA>Yes?

75
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:31,260
<4-2,ESPOSITO>拉斯洛女士  我是埃斯波西...
<4-2,ESPOSITO>Ms. Laszlo, I'm Detective Esposi--

76
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:33,720
<4-2,ESPOSITO>嗯
<4-2,ESPOSITO>Yeah.

77
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:37,130
<4-3,ESPOSITO>埃斯波西托警探  这位是莱恩警探
<4-3,ESPOSITO>Detective Esposito. This is Detective Ryan.

78
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:38,400
<4-3,ESPOSITO>我们有几个问题想问你
<4-3,ESPOSITO>We want to ask you a few questions

79
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,690
<4-3,ESPOSITO>是关于你报案的那起凶杀案
<4-3,ESPOSITO>about that murder you reported.

80
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,540
<4-3,ESPOSITO>-我们可以进来吗  -不行
<4-3,ESPOSITO>- Can we come in? - No.

81
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:45,920
<4-5,RYAN>抱歉  女士  我们还是得跟你谈谈
<4-5,RYAN>Excuse me, ma'am! We still need to talk to you!

82
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:49,010
<4-6,MIA>之所以匿名是有原因的
<4-6,MIA>There is a reason it was an anonymous call.

83
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:52,070
<4-7,RYAN>你目睹了凶杀  你要么让我们进去说
<4-7,RYAN>You witnessed a murder, so you either let us in to talk,

84
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:53,590
<4-7,RYAN>要么我们押你去警局
<4-7,RYAN>or we can drag you down to the station.

85
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:55,760
<4-8,MIA>等等
<4-8,MIA>Just a minute.

86
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,060
<4-9,MIA>好吧  听清楚  我们这么办
<4-9,MIA>Okay, listen closely. Here's how this is going to go.

87
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,860
<4-9,MIA>我单独坐后座
<4-9,MIA>I ride in the backseat, alone,

88
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,930
<4-9,MIA>窗户要一直开着
<4-9,MIA>and the windows stay down the whole way.

89
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:15,860
<5-1,BECKETT>你能想到会有谁
<5-1,BECKETT>Can you think of anyone

90
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,400
<5-1,BECKETT>想杀你哥哥吗
<5-1,BECKETT>who would have wanted to kill your brother?

91
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,890
<5-2,GRAHAM>没有  让人都爱贾斯汀  他是个大好人
<5-2,GRAHAM>No. Everyone loved Justin. He was such a good guy.

92
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,550
<5-2,GRAHAM>我们父母死后  他离开军队来照顾我
<5-2,GRAHAM>He left the army to take care of me after our parents died.

93
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,030
<5-2,GRAHAM>让我上了大学
<5-2,GRAHAM>He made sure that I went to college.

94
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:27,630
<5-2,GRAHAM>学费都是他付的  尽管他
<5-2,GRAHAM>He, uh... he paid for all of it, even though he...

95
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,270
<5-2,GRAHAM>他一开始老是找不到工作
<5-2,GRAHAM>he had a hard time finding a job at first.

96
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,930
<5-3,BECKETT>他究竟做什么
<5-3,BECKETT>And what did he do exactly?

97
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:33,410
<5-4,GRAHAM>他是高级司机  经常送东西
<5-4,GRAHAM>He was a high-end driver, made a lot of deliveries.

98
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:34,910
<5-5,BECKETT>有违法的东西吗
<5-5,BECKETT>Anything illegal?

99
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:36,440
<5-6,GRAHAM>我不知道  怎么了
<5-6,GRAHAM>I don't know. Why?

100
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,810
<5-7,BECKETT>我们在他车上发现了一个秘密隔间
<5-7,BECKETT>We found a secret compartment in his car,

101
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:39,520
<5-7,BECKETT>我们认为他可能
<5-7,BECKETT>and we think that he might

102
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,190
<5-7,BECKETT>是因为里面原本装的东西而被杀
<5-7,BECKETT>have been killed because of what was inside.

103
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,890
<5-7,BECKETT>你知道他在里面放了什么
<5-7,BECKETT>Do you have any idea what he kept in there

104
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:45,040
<5-7,BECKETT>或者他早上为什么会在那个停车场吗
<5-7,BECKETT>or maybe what he was doing in the garage this morning?

105
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,850
<5-7,BECKETT>不知道
<5-7,BECKETT>No.

106
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,430
<5-8,GRAHAM>我上次跟他通话是昨天
<5-8,GRAHAM>The last time that I spoke to him was yesterday.

107
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,280
<5-8,GRAHAM>他说要去见个叫猎鹰的人
<5-8,GRAHAM>He said that he had to go meet someone named Falcon.

108
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,240
<6-1,RYAN>贝克特
<6-1,RYAN>Hey, Beckett!

109
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:55,740
<6-1,RYAN>贝克特  贝克特

00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:48,810
<7-3,BECKETT>关于早上的凶案  你还记得什么
<7-3,BECKETT>Uh, so, what do you remember about the murder this morning?

127
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:50,120
<7-4,MIA>不记得什么了
<7-4,MIA>Not much.

128
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,570
<7-4,MIA>我听到两声枪响
<7-4,MIA>I heard two gunshots,

129
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:53,290
<7-4,MIA>然后有个带着滑雪面罩的家伙
<7-4,MIA>and then a guy with a ski mask

130
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:54,270
<7-4,MIA>跟我一起上了电梯
<7-4,MIA>got on the elevator with me.

131
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:57,220
<7-4,MIA>我以为他要杀我  可他没有
<7-4,MIA>I thought he was gonna kill me, but he didn't.

132
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:59,330
<7-4,MIA>反而在一楼下了电梯
<7-4,MIA>Instead, he got off at the ground level.

133
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,920
<7-4,MIA>于是我打了911然后离开了
<7-4,MIA>I called 911 and left.

134
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,810
<7-4,MIA>我现在能回家了吗
<7-4,MIA>Can I go home now?

135
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:03,370
<7-6,MIA>-不行  -为什么
<7-6,MIA>- Uh, no. - Why not?

136
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:07,360
<7-7,BECKETT>因为我还...没问完
<7-7,BECKETT>Because I'm not done asking you questions just...yet.

137
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,500
<7-8,MIA>你早餐总是吃甘蓝菜吗
<7-8,MIA>Do you always eat kale for breakfast?

138
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,520
<7-8,MIA>这可不好
<7-8,MIA>'cause that is just wrong.

139
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,910
<7-9,BECKETT>你怎么知道我今早吃了甘蓝菜
<7-9,BECKETT>How did you know that I had kale this morning?

140
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:14,780
<7-10,MIA>你一身的甘蓝味
<7-10,MIA>You reek of it.

141
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:19,630
<7-10,MIA>这一屋子都是很烂的希腊菜味儿
<7-10,MIA>Like, this room stinks of grade-"D" greek food.

142
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,620
<7-11,BECKETT>你鼻子还真灵
<7-11,BECKETT>You're very sensitive to smell.

143
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,960
<7-12,MIA>你真该改名叫废话警监
<7-12,MIA>Oh, you should change your name to Captain Obvious.

144
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,100
<7-12,MIA>我这叫嗅觉过敏
<7-12,MIA>It's called hyperosmia.

145
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:27,380
<7-12,MIA>自己查字典
<7-12,MIA>Look it up.

146
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,260
<7-13,BECKETT>好吧  那凶手有什么味道
<7-13,BECKETT>Okay, uh, so, what did our killer smell like?

147
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,260
<7-14,MIA>天啊  我说不好
<7-14,MIA>Gosh, I don't know.

148
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:36,150
<7-14,MIA>要么是宠物狗  要么就是火药味
<7-14,MIA>It was either puppies or gunpowder.

149
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:37,610
<7-15,BECKETT>你总是这么凶巴巴的吗
<7-15,BECKETT>Are you always this unpleasant?

150
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:38,430
<7-16,MIA>对
<7-16,MIA>Yep.

151
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,540
<7-17,BECKETT>关于电梯里的那个人
<7-17,BECKETT>Is there anything else that you remember

152
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,980
<7-17,BECKETT>你还记得什么吗
<7-17,BECKETT>about the guy in the elevator?

153
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,150
<7-18,MIA>他是个白人
<7-18,MIA>He was a white guy.

154
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:47,920
<7-18,MIA>一米八出头  穿着深色衣服
<7-18,MIA>Was about six feet tall, dark clothes,

155
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:51,230
<7-18,MIA>他还从死者身上抢了个银色公文包
<7-18,MIA>And he was carrying a silver briefcase that he got off of that dead guy.

<8-26,BECKETT>Okay. Thanks.

192
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,810
<9-1,MIA>她显然喜欢你
<9-1,MIA>She's clearly got the hots for you.

193
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,040
<9-2,CASTLE>谁
<9-2,CASTLE>Who?

194
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,780
<9-3,MIA>辣妹警监啊
<9-3,MIA>Captain hoochie mama.

195
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,110
<9-3,MIA>她看到你的时候  信息素分泌都要冲破天际了
<9-3,MIA>Her pheromone output went through the roof when she saw you.

196
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:38,600
<9-4,CASTLE>你怎么知道的
<9-4,CASTLE>And you know this how?

197
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:40,900
<9-5,MIA>我能闻到  就像我还能闻到
<9-5,MIA>I can smell it, like I can smell

198
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,250
<9-5,MIA>你今早用剃须膏洗了头
<9-5,MIA>that you washed your hair with shaving cream this morning,

199
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:46,730
<9-5,MIA>而且你吃了隔夜的玉米饼却没刷牙
<9-5,MIA>And you chose day-old tacos over brushing your teeth.

200
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,480
<9-6,CASTLE>你是巫师吗
<9-6,CASTLE>Are you a wizard?

201
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,640
<9-7,MIA>被诅咒的巫师
<9-7,MIA>A cursed one.

202
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:51,050
<9-8,CASTLE>等等  你有嗅觉过敏症
<9-8,CASTLE>Wait. You have hyperosmia.

203
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:53,470
<9-8,CASTLE>你的嗅觉到底敏感到了什么程度
<9-8,CASTLE>Just how heightened is your olfactory acuity?

204
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,790
<9-9,MIA>超级敏感  你怎么...
<9-9,MIA>It's off the charts. How do you --

205
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:55,980
<9-10,CASTLE>我博览群书啊
<9-10,CASTLE>I read a lot.

206
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:56,940
<9-10,CASTLE>你是说
<9-10,CASTLE>You're telling me you can tell

207
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,590
<9-10,CASTLE>你单凭贝克特散发出的气味就能知道她对我的感觉
<9-10,CASTLE>exactly how Beckett feels about me just by her smell?

208
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:00,350
<10-2,ESPOSITO>没错
<10-2,ESPOSITO>Yes.

209
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:02,680
<10-3,HAYLEY>告诉你吧
<10-3,HAYLEY>Tell you what.

210
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,910
<9-10,CASTLE>我有辆新款法拉利就在楼下
<9-10,CASTLE>I have a brand-new ferrari downstairs.

211
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,600
<9-11,MIA>闻起来就像天堂
<9-11,MIA>Smells like heaven.

212
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,350
<9-12,CASTLE>要不我送你回家
<9-12,CASTLE>How about I give you a ride home

213
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:10,060
<9-12,CASTLE>你再跟我多说说
<9-12,CASTLE>and you can tell me a little more?

214
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,710
<9-12,CASTLE>或者让朱利安警官送你也行
<9-12,CASTLE>Or officer Julian here can give you a ride home,

215
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:14,890
<9-12,CASTLE>他最爱的食物可是香肠配巧克力奶
<9-12,CASTLE>and his favorite meal is sausages and chocolate milk.

216
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:18,520
<9-13,CASTLE>这就对了
<9-13,CASTLE>That's what I thought.

217
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,030
<9-13,CASTLE>朱利安  交给我就行了  谢了
<9-13,CASTLE>Julian, I got this. Thanks.

218
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,170
<9-14,CASTLE>海莉  你怎么来了
<9-14,CASTLE>Hayley, what are you doing here?

219
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:23,980
<9-15,HAYLEY SHIPTON>工作
<9-15,HAYLEY SHIPTON>Working.

220
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,790
<9-16,CASTLE>她也很喜欢我  你应该能...
<9-16,CASTLE>She likes me a lot, too. You can probably tell --

221
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:27,570
<9-16,CASTLE>并没有
<9-16,CASTLE>No.

222
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,400
<10-1,RYAN>我们还在查被害人的电话记录和社交网络信息
<10-1,RYAN>We're still looking into our victim's phone records and social media,

223
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,210
<10-1,RYAN>但目前为止  还没发现任何叫猎鹰的
<10-1,RYAN>But so far, we haven't found anyone named Falcon.

224
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:36,740
<10-2,ESPOSITO>但我们发现了一条可能的线索
<10-2,ESPOSITO>But we did find a possible link

225
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,420
<10-2,ESPOSITO>是一家叫猎鹰会的公司
<10-2,ESPOSITO>to a company called the Falcon Unit.

226
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,290
<10-2,ESPOSITO>现在正在查
<10-2,ESPOSITO>We're checking them out now.

227
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:41,200
<10-3,HAYLEY>还费什么劲  我知道他们啊
<10-3,HAYLEY>Why bother when I could just tell you who they are?

228
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,710
<10-4,BECKETT>某人真会隆重登场
<10-4,BECKETT>Somebody knows how to make an entrance.

229
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:43,630
<10-5,HAYLEY>大家好啊
<10-5,HAYLEY>Hello, all.

230
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:44,880
<10-6,ESPOSITO>你好啊姑娘  还好吗
<10-6,ESPOSITO>What's up, girl? How you doing?

231
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,650
<10-6,ESPOSITO>很高兴再次见到你  裤子真赞
<10-6,ESPOSITO>Nice to see you again. Great pants.

232
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,830
<10-7,BECKETT>言归正传  你刚才说...
<10-7,BECKETT>Anyway, you were saying?

233
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,060
<10-8,HAYLEY>猎鹰会  这是家私人公司
<10-8,HAYLEY>The Falcon Unit, it's a private company

234
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,340
<10-8,HAYLEY>特长是帮富有的客户
<10-8,HAYLEY>that specializes in transporting sensitive

235
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:57,250
<10-8,HAYLEY>运输敏感的  偶尔还有违法的物品
<10-8,HAYLEY>and occasionally illegal items for wealthy clients.

236
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,700
<10-9,ESPOSITO>那咱们的被害人是像电影里那种送玩命快递的
<10-9,ESPOSITO>So our victim was a transporter, like the movie?

237
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,610
<10-10,RYAN>这就解释了装甲的跑车
<10-10,RYAN>That explains the armored sports car

238
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:02,740
<10-10,RYAN>和秘密隔间
<10-10,RYAN>and secret compartment.

239
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,530
<10-11,BECKETT>那么  公文包里有什么
<10-11,BECKETT>So, what was in the briefcase?

240
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:07,150
<10-12,HAYLEY>恐怕答案是有偿的
<10-12,HAYLEY>I'm afraid the answer to that comes with a price.

241
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,450
<10-12,HAYLEY>我想加入调查
<10-12,HAYLEY>I want in on the investigation.

242
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,970
<10-13,BECKETT>这事对你有什么好处
<10-13,BECKETT>And what's in this for you?

243
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:12,250
<10-14,HAYLEY>公文包里的物品
<10-14,HAYLEY>The item in the briefcase

244
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,530
<10-14,HAYLEY>保了很大一笔保险
<10-14,HAYLEY>has a rather large insurance policy.

245
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:16,540
<10-14,HAYLEY>保险公司雇我把它找回来
<10-14,HAYLEY>The insurance company has hired me to recover it.

246
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,280
<10-15,BECKETT>这可不是什么寻宝游戏
<10-15,BECKETT>You know, this isn't a treasure hunt.

247
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,800
<10-15,BECKETT>我们是要破凶杀案
<10-15,BECKETT>We're trying to solve a homicide.

248
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,490
<10-16,HAYLEY>死者是因为那个箱子而死的
<10-16,HAYLEY>And your victim was killed for that briefcase,

249
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,090
<10-16,HAYLEY>如果你找到凶手  我也能找到丢失的东西
<10-16,HAYLEY>so you find your killer, I find my missing item.

250
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:25,430
<10-16,HAYLEY>大家各取所需
<10-16,HAYLEY>Everyone goes home happy?

251
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,090
<10-17,BECKETT>好吧
<10-17,BECKETT>Okay.

252
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:30,440
<10-18,RYAN>那死者要运送的是什么东西
<10-18,RYAN>So, what was our victim hired to transport?

253
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,040
<10-19,HAYLEY>一副梵高的画  在二战时丢失了
<10-19,HAYLEY>A Van Gogh, lost since World War II,

254
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,010
<10-19,HAYLEY>在三周前的拍卖会上以六千五百万被拍下
<10-19,HAYLEY>purchased at auction 3 weeks ago for $65 million.

264
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,930
<11-1,BECKETT>丢失很久的梵高的画卖出了大价钱
<11-1,BECKETT>Long-lost Van Gogh sold for a fortune.

265
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:49,490
<11-1,BECKETT>这事网上怎么没有
<11-1,BECKETT>How come this wasn't on the Internet?

266
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:51,130
<11-2,HAYLEY>这幅画的身世很复杂
<11-2,HAYLEY>The painting has a complicated history.

267
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:53,280
<11-2,HAYLEY>在战争期间被抢过很多次
<11-2,HAYLEY>It was looted several times during the war,

268
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,640
<11-2,HAYLEY>想要正当买卖是不可能的
<11-2,HAYLEY>which made an aboveboard sale impossible,

269
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,790
<11-2,HAYLEY>所以只能秘密地在苏黎世被拍卖
<11-2,HAYLEY>so it was auctioned secretly in Zurich,

270
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,490
<11-2,HAYLEY>买家远程竞拍
<11-2,HAYLEY>with potential buyers bidding remotely.

271
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:00,930
<11-3,RYAN>我们应该弄到竞拍者的名单
<11-3,RYAN>We should get a list of the other bidders.

272
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:02,740
<11-3,RYAN>可能是其中一个没拍到的人想要偷它
<11-3,RYAN>Maybe one of the losers tried to steal it.

273
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:05,150
<11-4,HAYLEY>我已经试过了  拍卖行不合作
<11-4,HAYLEY>I already tried. Auction house isn't playing ball.

274
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,530
<11-4,HAYLEY>如果他们泄露了客户资料
<11-4,HAYLEY>I mean, they give up their clients,

275
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:07,410
<11-4,HAYLEY>他们的生意就完了
<11-4,HAYLEY>they lose their business.

276
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:08,830
<11-5,BECKETT>我去联系一下国务院
<11-5,BECKETT>You know what? I'll reach out to the state department,

277
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:10,460
<11-5,BECKETT>看他们能不能施加点压力
<11-5,BECKETT>see if they can apply a little pressure.

278
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,030
<11-6,ESPOSITO>我想我找到凶手了
<11-6,ESPOSITO>I think I found our killer.

279
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:14,020
<11-6,ESPOSITO>一部自动取款机的摄像头
<11-6,ESPOSITO>An ATM camera caught a guy

280
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,470
<11-6,ESPOSITO>拍下了一个符合目击者描述的人
<11-6,ESPOSITO>matching our witness' description

281
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:17,200
<11-6,ESPOSITO>在十点半的时候离开了停车场
<11-6,ESPOSITO>exiting the parking garage at 10:30.

282
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,780
<11-7,BECKETT>那是凶案发生后十五分钟
<11-7,BECKETT>That's 15 minutes after the murder.

283
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:19,980
<11-7,BECKETT>他怎么还在附近呢
<11-7,BECKETT>How come he was still around?

284
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:21,180
<11-8,HAYLEY>可能是藏箱子
<11-8,HAYLEY>Probably stashing the briefcase.

285
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,900
<11-9,ESPOSITO>两分钟后  一个地铁的摄像头拍到了他
<11-9,ESPOSITO>Two minutes later, a subway cam caught him

286
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:23,680
<11-9,ESPOSITO>正在上F线
<11-9,ESPOSITO>hopping the "F" Train.

287
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:26,760
<11-9,ESPOSITO>他的地铁卡是用一张信用卡买的
<11-9,ESPOSITO>Now, his metro card was purchased with a credit card

288
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,060
<11-9,ESPOSITO>卡主是弗雷迪·斯塔克  一个低级的混混
<11-9,ESPOSITO>belonging to a Freddy Stark, a low-level dirtbag

289
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,230
<11-9,ESPOSITO>有过非法闯入和暴力袭击的前科
<11-9,ESPOSITO>with a history of B&E and violent assault.

290
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,530
<11-10,BECKETT>干得漂亮  警长
<11-10,BECKETT>Nice job, Sarge.

291
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:37,110
<12-1,CASTLE>贝克特和我结婚将近一年了
<12-1,CASTLE>So, Beckett and I had been married almost a year,

292
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:38,530
<12-1,CASTLE>而且我们之间挺好的
<12-1,CASTLE>And -- and things were going great,

293
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:40,330
<12-1,CASTLE>可是突然之间  她就说需要空间
<12-1,CASTLE>and then, suddenly, she says she needs space.

294
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:41,690
<12-2,MIA>这关我什么事呢
<12-2,MIA>Why is that my problem?

295
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:44,040
<12-3,CASTLE>不关的  我只是在想
<12-3,CASTLE>Oh, it's not, but I-I was just thinking,

296
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,920
<12-3,CASTLE>你对信息素那么敏感
<12-3,CASTLE>you're so attuned to pheromone output,

297
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,550
<12-3,CASTLE>这样你就能在贝克特的事上帮到我
<12-3,CASTLE>you could help me with my interactions with Beckett,

298
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,360
<12-3,CASTLE>告诉我什么时候吸引到她了
<12-3,CASTLE>let me know when I'm being charming,

299
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,200
<12-3,CASTLE>什么时候烦到她了
<12-3,CASTLE>let me know when I'm annoying her.

300
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,160
<12-4,MIA>像这样吗
<12-4,MIA>You mean like this?

301
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,200
<12-4,MIA>卡塞尔  你很烦人
<12-4,MIA>Hey, Castle, you're being annoying.

302
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,120
<12-5,CASTLE>是的  不过我觉得
<12-5,CASTLE>Yes, only I'm thinking

303
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,300
<12-5,CASTLE>最好是悄悄地给我做个手势  这样她就...
<12-5,CASTLE>more like a secret hand gesture so she doesn't...

304
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,470
<12-5,CASTLE>你是说现在我很烦人吗
<12-5,CASTLE>You mean right now?

305
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,220
<12-5,CASTLE>是的
<12-5,CASTLE>Yeah.

306
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:06,170
<12-6,MIA>听着  你其实在气味上没特别恼人
<12-6,MIA>Listen, you are actually fairly inoffensive on an odor level,

307
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:07,740
<12-6,MIA>可是我不喜欢与人交际
<12-6,MIA>but I am not a people person

308
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,100
<12-6,MIA>而且我也不想跟人交际
<12-6,MIA>and have zero interest in becoming one.

309
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:11,770
<12-7,CASTLE>让我进去  我会说服你的
<12-7,CASTLE>Let me in. Let me convince you.

310
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:14,330
<12-8,MIA>想都别想  除了我没人能进去
<12-8,MIA>Forget it. No one goes inside but me.

311
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:16,820
<12-9,CASTLE>这样会很寂寞啊
<12-9,CASTLE>Well, that sounds lonely.

312
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:18,890
<12-10,MIA>才不会
<12-10,MIA>It's not.

313
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:20,670
<12-10,MIA>不  我才不...
<12-10,MIA>No. I-I-I'm not...

314
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:21,730
<12-11,CASTLE>就五分钟
<12-11,CASTLE>Five minutes.

315
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:22,660
<12-11,CASTLE>如果我说服不了你
<12-11,CASTLE>If I haven't convinced you,

316
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,850
<12-11,CASTLE>你可以把我赶出来
<12-11,CASTLE>you can just kick me out.

317
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:25,170
<12-11,CASTLE>好吧
<12-11,CASTLE>Fine.

318
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,190
<12-12,MIA>可是你得先净化一下
<12-12,MIA>But you have to be decontaminated.

319
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,500
<12-13,CASTLE>挺好玩的啊
<12-13,CASTLE>Sounds like fun.

320
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:55,890
<13-1,CASTLE>你在家里工作
<13-1,CASTLE>You work from home.

321
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:59,500
<13-2,MIA>我给一家香水公司做气味顾问
<13-2,MIA>I consult for a perfume company as a professional nose,

322
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,490
<13-2,MIA>专攻原始吸引
<13-2,MIA>specializing in primal attraction.

323
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:05,280
<13-3,CASTLE>可你一个人住  也没有人来看你
<13-3,CASTLE>And yet you live alone and never have visitors.

324
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,730
<13-3,CASTLE>我也见人的
<13-3,CASTLE>I see people.

325
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,090
<13-4,MIA>每周去一次办公室
<13-4,MIA>I go into the office once a week.

326
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,690
<13-4,MIA>我只能承受这么多
<13-4,MIA>That's all I can handle.

327
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,570
<13-4,MIA>况且  看我离开家发生了什么
<13-4,MIA>And besides, look what happens when you leave.

328
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:16,650
<13-4,MIA>搭电梯的时候遇到一个满头大汗的凶手
<13-4,MIA>You wind up riding an elevator with a sweaty killer.

329
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,400
<13-5,CASTLE>你能闻到他出汗了
<13-5,CASTLE>You could smell his sweat.

330
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,420
<13-6,MIA>还有他的枪
<13-6,MIA>And his gun.

331
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:20,930
<13-7,CASTLE>还有什么
<13-7,CASTLE>What else?

332
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,320
<13-8,MIA>没了
<13-8,MIA>Nothing.

333
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:25,640
<13-8,MIA>扯  你就像条猎犬
<13-8,MIA>Bull. You're like a bloodhound.

334
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,590
<13-9,CASTLE>你只是不想被牵扯到其中
<13-9,CASTLE>You just don't want to get involved.

335
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,150
<13-9,CASTLE>可是我敢打赌  只要你再闻到这个凶手
<13-9,CASTLE>But I'm betting you could identify this killer

336
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,380
<13-9,CASTLE>你就能认出他来
<13-9,CASTLE>if you smelled him again.

337
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:33,430
<13-9,CASTLE>很好闻
<13-9,CASTLE>That's nice.

00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:03,760
<15-4,BECKETT>他怎么知道这个案子的
<15-4,BECKETT>How does he even know about this case?

<16-5,HAYLEY>Who's Mia?

357
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,680
<16-6,CASTLE>她是目击证人
<16-6,CASTLE>She's an eyewitness --

358

<16-6,CASTLE>Well, technically, she's a nose-witness.

00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,730
<16-7,MIA>请把那个放下
<16-7,MIA>Please put that down.

361
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,250
<16-8,BECKETT>可凶手带着面具
<16-8,BECKETT>who was wearing a mask.

362
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:26,170
<16-9,CASTLE>无所谓  因为她能通过味道认出他来
<16-9,CASTLE>That doesn't matter because she can I.D. him by his smell.

363
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:28,680
<16-10,BECKETT>是的  她说他闻起来像是火药味
<16-10,BECKETT>Yeah, she said that he smelled like gunpowder.

364
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,740
<16-10,BECKETT>我要挂电话了
<16-10,BECKETT>Look, I'm gonna hang up.

365
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,830
<16-10,BECKETT>这可不是瞎闹的时候
<16-10,BECKETT>This isn't time for party games.

366
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,830
<16-11,MIA>没有瞎闹
<16-11,MIA>It's not a party game.

367
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:35,740
<16-12,HAYLEY>好吧  那你就告诉我们点
<16-12,HAYLEY>Okay, then tell us something unique

368
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,270
<16-12,HAYLEY>-凶手气味的特别之处  -是啊
<16-12,HAYLEY>- about the killer's scent. - Yeah.

369
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:41,040
<16-14,MIA>有一丝卸甲油的味道
<16-14,MIA>There was a hint of nail-polish remover.

370
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:46,790
<16-15,BECKETT>一个一米八的人身上有卸甲油的味道吗
<16-15,BECKETT>A six-foot-tall guy who smells like nail-polish remover.

371
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:47,990
<16-15,BECKETT>这是在浪费时间
<16-15,BECKETT>This is a waste of time.

372
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,380
<16-16,CASTLE>等等  告诉她那个
<16-16,CASTLE>Hang on. Tell her the thing.

373
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,820
<16-17,MIA>好吧  这个怎么样
<16-17,MIA>Okay, how about this?

374
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,810
<16-17,MIA>那个手提箱里面有一副老油画
<16-17,MIA>There was an old oil painting in that briefcase.

375
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,420
<16-18,CASTLE>信了吧
<16-18,CASTLE>Boom.

376
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:57,770
<16-19,BECKETT>你怎么知道这个的
<16-19,BECKETT>How do you know that?

377
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:00,360
<16-20,MIA>你反应迟钝吗  我闻见了
<16-20,MIA>Are you slow? I smelled it.

378
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:02,120
<16-21,MIA>你确定你想挽回她吗
<16-21,MIA>Are you sure you want her back?

379
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:02,730
<16-21,MIA>我觉得你能找到更好的
<16-21,MIA>'cause I think you can do better.

380
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:04,430
<16-22,CASTLE>-这  -贝克特  我们马上去分局
<16-22,CASTLE>- This - Beckett, we're gonna come down to the precinct.

381
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:05,480
<16-23,BECKETT>不  卡塞尔
<16-23,BECKETT>No! Castle --

382
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:07,500
<17-1,MIA>我不去
<17-1,MIA>I'm not going.

383
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,910
<17-2,CASTLE>不  你要去
<17-2,CASTLE>Yes, you are.

384
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,400
<17-3,MIA>为什么  因为你觉得我能帮你挽回你妻子
<17-3,MIA>Why? Because you think I can help you get your wife back?

385
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,660
<17-3,MIA>不  好吧  是
<17-3,MIA>No. Well, y-yes.

386
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,990
<17-4,CASTLE>但也是因为今天早上有一个人被谋杀了
<17-4,CASTLE>But because a man was murdered this morning,

387
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,740
<17-4,CASTLE>需要有人为他伸张正义
<17-4,CASTLE>and that man deserves justice.

388
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:23,250
<17-4,CASTLE>你把你的嗅觉过敏当作诅咒
<17-4,CASTLE>You know, you see your hyperosmia as a curse,

389
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,220
<17-4,CASTLE>但与此同时  你也获得了一个很好的天赋
<17-4,CASTLE>when, really, you've been given a great gift.

390
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,380
<17-4,CASTLE>在你的帮助下
<17-4,CASTLE>And with your help,

391
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,120
<17-4,CASTLE>警察可以把这个冷血杀手抓捕归案
<17-4,CASTLE>the police can put away a cold-blooded killer.

392
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,820
<17-4,CASTLE>这是不是值得让你出面帮忙
<17-4,CASTLE>Now, isn't that worth putting yourself out there?

393
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:35,910
<17-4,CASTLE>不
<17-4,CASTLE>No.

394
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:37,560
<17-5,MIA>你做什么也不能
<17-5,MIA>And there is nothing you can do

395
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,530
<17-5,MIA>让我离开我的公寓
<17-5,MIA>to make me leave my apartment.

396
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:40,540
<17-6,CASTLE>什么都不能
<17-6,CASTLE>Nothing?

397
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,440
<17-6,CASTLE>什么都不能
<17-6,CASTLE>Nothing.

398
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,160
<17-7,MIA>-抱歉  -天啊
<17-7,MIA>- I'm sorry. - Oh, my god.

399
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,620
<17-8,CASTLE>特殊情况  特殊手段
<17-8,CASTLE>Desperate times call for desperate measures.

400
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,530
<17-9,CASTLE>这些玉米片味道真难闻
<17-9,CASTLE>Oh, you were right about those tacos.

401
00:16:58,450 --> 00:16:59,590
<18-1,MIA>他不是凶手
<18-1,MIA>He's not the killer.

402
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,840
<18-2,BECKETT>如果被别人知道我授权闻味指认凶手
<18-2,BECKETT>If word gets out that I authorized a smell lineup --

403
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,110
<18-3,CASTLE>有让见到过凶手的人看人指认
<18-3,CASTLE>They have visual lineups for people who have seen killers,

404
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:07,090
<18-3,CASTLE>听过凶手说话的人通过声音指认
<18-3,CASTLE>Voice lineups for people who have heard them.

405
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:12,320
<18-3,CASTLE>但无论如何  我们知道弗雷迪当时在停车场
<18-3,CASTLE>But regardless, we know Freddy was at the garage,

406
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,180
<18-3,CASTLE>他很明显在说谎  所以
<18-3,CASTLE>and he's clearly lying, so --

407
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:16,580
<18-4,BECKETT>我们骗他  告诉他我们的目击者已经指认他了
<18-4,BECKETT>So we lie to him, tell him that our witness I.D.'d him.

408
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:17,900
<18-5,CASTLE>然后看他说什么
<18-5,CASTLE>And watch him talk.

409
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,520
<19-1,FREDDY>我没杀他
<19-1,FREDDY>I didn't kill him!

410
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,210
<19-2,BECKETT>我们的目击者可不是这么说的
<19-2,BECKETT>That's not what our witness says.

411
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,570
<19-3,FREDDY>这算什么指认啊
<19-3,FREDDY>What kind of lineup was that, anyway?

412
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,090
<19-3,FREDDY>那个目击者都没有看我的脸
<19-3,FREDDY>The witness didn't even look at my face!

413
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:28,850
<19-5,FREDDY>-那幅画在哪  -不在我这
<19-5,FREDDY>- Where's the painting? - I don't have it.

414
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:30,160
<19-6,BECKETT>别废话  弗雷迪
<19-6,BECKETT>Cut the crap, Freddy.

415
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,260
<19-6,BECKETT>你只有一次机会说服我
<19-6,BECKETT>You got one chance to convince me

416
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,580
<19-6,BECKETT>你不是杀人犯
<19-6,BECKETT>that you're not the murderer.

417
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,670
<19-7,FREDDY>好吧  听着  我确实在停车场
<19-7,FREDDY>Okay, listen, I was at the garage,

418
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:36,910
<19-7,FREDDY>但不是去杀人的
<19-7,FREDDY>but not to kill the guy.

419
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:38,850
<19-7,FREDDY>-我被派去取回那幅画  -谁派你的
<19-7,FREDDY>- I was hired to retrieve the painting. - By who?

420
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:40,120
<19-9,FREDDY>汤姆·吉列姆  猎鹰会的头
<19-9,FREDDY>Tom Gilliam. Head of the falcon unit.

421
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,020
<19-10,BECKETT>就是让贾斯汀去运送那幅画的公司
<19-10,BECKETT>That's who hired Justin to transport it.

422
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:44,210
<19-10,BECKETT>他们为什么又会让你去偷
<19-10,BECKETT>Why would they want you to steal it from him?

423
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,040
<19-10,BECKETT>我不知道
<19-10,BECKETT>I don't know.

424
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,410
<19-11,FREDDY>但吉列姆让我去
<19-11,FREDDY>But Gilliam was really upset

425
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:47,640
<19-11,FREDDY>找贾斯汀时非常不高兴
<19-11,FREDDY>when he hired me to hunt Justin down,

426
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,990
<19-11,FREDDY>叫我无论如何都要把画拿回来
<19-11,FREDDY>told me to do whatever it took to get the painting back.

427
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:51,900
<19-11,FREDDY>所以我黑了贾斯汀车上的导航
<19-11,FREDDY>So I hacked the GPS in justin's car

428
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,190
<19-11,FREDDY>跟踪他去了停车场
<19-11,FREDDY>and followed him to the garage.

429
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:54,650
<19-11,FREDDY>但等我赶到时
<19-11,FREDDY>But by the time I got there,

430
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:57,760
<19-11,FREDDY>他已经死了  画也不见了
<19-11,FREDDY>he was already dead and the painting was gone.

431
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,070
<19-12,BECKETT>你什么时候赶到停车场的
<19-12,BECKETT>What time did you get there?

432
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:01,090
<19-13,FREDDY>十点二十才到
<19-13,FREDDY>Didn't get to the garage till 10:20.

433
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:04,560
<20-1,ESPOSITO>好吧  谢谢
<20-1,ESPOSITO>All right, thanks.

434
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,080
<20-1,ESPOSITO>警监证实了弗雷迪的说法
<20-1,ESPOSITO>Captain confirms Freddy's story.

435
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,970
<20-2,RYAN>所以他在米娅报警后才到
<20-2,RYAN>So he arrived after Mia called 911.

436
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:11,280
<20-3,ESPOSITO>意味着他不是凶手
<20-3,ESPOSITO>Which means he ain't our guy.

437
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,540
<20-3,ESPOSITO>你打算怎么审这个猎鹰会的家伙
<20-3,ESPOSITO>So, how do you want to go at this falcon unit dude?

438
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,610
<20-3,ESPOSITO>我说我们跟他来硬的
<20-3,ESPOSITO>I say we hit him hard.

439
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,620
<20-3,ESPOSITO>这种人只有恐吓他才能起作用
<20-3,ESPOSITO>Guys like this only respond to intimidation.

440
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,230
<20-4,RYAN>现在要这样了吗
<20-4,RYAN>Is that the way it's gonna be now?

441
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,310
<20-4,RYAN>我升职了  所以我说我们这么做
<20-4,RYAN>"I get this big promotion, and I say we do it this way."

442
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:22,860
<20-5,ESPOSITO>不  我们可以按照你的方式来
<20-5,ESPOSITO>Hey, hey, no. We can do it your way.

443
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,390
<20-5,ESPOSITO>你想怎么做
<20-5,ESPOSITO>How do you want to play it?

444
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:27,830
<20-6,RYAN>我说我们跟他来硬的
<20-6,RYAN>I say we go at him hard.

445
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:28,970
<20-6,RYAN>打扰了
<20-6,RYAN>Excuse me!

446
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,130
<20-7,RYAN>汤姆·吉列姆  我是莱恩警探
<20-7,RYAN>Tom Gilliam, I'm detective Ryan.

447
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:32,330
<20-7,RYAN>这是埃斯波西托警探
<20-7,RYAN>This is detective Esposito.

448
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:33,440
<20-7,RYAN>关于贾斯汀·弗莱彻的凶杀案
<20-7,RYAN>We just have a few questions

449
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,930
<20-7,RYAN>我们有几个问题要问你
<20-7,RYAN>about the murder of Justin Fletcher.

450
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:37,790
<20-8,TOM GILLIAM>那真是个悲剧  但我对此一无所知
<20-8,TOM GILLIAM>A real tragedy, but I don't know anything about it.

451
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,040
<20-9,ESPOSITO>那就有意思了  因为弗雷迪·斯塔克说你知道
<20-9,ESPOSITO>That's funny, 'cause Freddy Stark says you do.

452
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,340
<20-10,GILLIAM>有什么我能帮忙的吗
<20-10,GILLIAM>How can I help you?

453
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,580
<20-11,RYAN>你可以从告诉我们为什么你雇佣弗雷迪
<20-11,RYAN>Well, you can start by telling us why you hired Freddy

454
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,940
<20-11,RYAN>去从你自己的雇员那把画偷回来开始
<20-11,RYAN>to steal that painting back from your own employee.

455
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:54,790
<20-12,GILLIAM>你们消息错了
<20-12,GILLIAM>You got it all wrong.

456
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:56,480
<20-12,GILLIAM>我没有雇佣弗雷迪去偷它
<20-12,GILLIAM>I didn't hire Freddy to steal it.

457
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:57,750
<20-12,GILLIAM>我雇佣他去取回它
<20-12,GILLIAM>I hired him to retrieve it.

458
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,150
<20-12,GILLIAM>贾斯汀从我们这偷走了它
<20-12,GILLIAM>Justin stole it from us.

459
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,410
<20-13,ESPOSITO>这说不通
<20-13,ESPOSITO>That doesn't make sense.

460
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:02,390
<20-13,ESPOSITO>你雇佣贾斯汀来运输这幅画
<20-13,ESPOSITO>You hired Justin to transport the painting.

461
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:04,650
<20-14,GILLIAM>不  我雇佣了别人
<20-14,GILLIAM>No. I hired someone else.

462
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:08,180
<20-14,GILLIAM>运输货物的人抽取佣金  货到付款
<20-14,GILLIAM>Transporters work on commission, payable upon delivery,

463
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,600
<20-14,GILLIAM>那幅画的佣金达到了六位数
<20-14,GILLIAM>and the commission for that painting was six figures.

464
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,110
<20-14,GILLIAM>贾斯汀一定是起了贪心  抢了这份工作
<20-14,GILLIAM>Justin must have gotten greedy and jumped the job.

465
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:16,320
<20-15,ESPOSITO>直到真的运输员来取那幅画的时候
<20-15,ESPOSITO>We didn't realize until the real transporter arrived

466
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,640
<20-14,GILLIAM>我们才意识到它不见了
<20-14,GILLIAM>to pick up the painting, and it was gone.

467
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,550
<20-15,ESPOSITO>那谁是真正的运输员
<20-15,ESPOSITO>Then who's the real transporter?

468
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,320
<21-1,ESPOSITO>利亚姆·霍利斯特  前英国雇佣兵
<21-1,ESPOSITO>Liam Hollister, ex-British mercenary.

469
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,360
<21-1,ESPOSITO>因为太过暴力被开除出
<21-1,ESPOSITO>Kicked out of the French foreign legion

470
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,270
<21-1,ESPOSITO>法国外籍兵团
<21-1,ESPOSITO>for being too violent.

471
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:29,120
<21-2,RYAN>根据海莉的说法
<21-2,RYAN>According to Hayley,

472
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:31,440
<21-2,RYAN>猎鹰每当有大笔的业务时都会找利亚姆
<21-2,RYAN>Liam is falcon's go-to guy for big-money jobs.

473
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,900
<21-3,ESPOSITO>我认为他对于贾斯汀偷走他的任务
<21-3,ESPOSITO>I don't think he'd take too kindly

474
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,490
<21-3,ESPOSITO>不会很高兴
<21-3,ESPOSITO>to Justin stealing his commission.

475
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:35,310
<21-3,ESPOSITO>可能采取了擅自行动
<21-3,ESPOSITO>Might go rogue.

476
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,970
<21-4,RYAN>于是他跟踪贾斯汀去了那个停车场
<21-4,RYAN>So he tracked Justin to that garage

477
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:38,580
<21-4,RYAN>用两颗子弹交换了那幅画
<21-4,RYAN>and traded two bullets for that painting.

478
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:40,440
<21-5,ESPOSITO>按说他刚杀了人
<21-5,ESPOSITO>You'd think he'd be rolling around in something

479
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,280
<21-5,ESPOSITO>该开辆低调点的车出来晃
<21-5,ESPOSITO>a little more subtle after committing murder.

480
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,030
<21-6,RYAN>是啊
<21-6,RYAN>Yeah.

481
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:46,540
<21-7,ESPOSITO>兄弟  我们没事吧
<21-7,ESPOSITO>Hey, bro... are we good?

482
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:48,960
<21-8,RYAN>是啊  当然
<21-8,RYAN>Yeah, yeah. Of course.

483
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,860
<21-8,RYAN>为什么这么问
<21-8,RYAN>Why do you even ask?

484
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,680
<21-9,ESPOSITO>因为你一整天都有点奇怪
<21-9,ESPOSITO>Cause you've been acting weird all day.

485
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,010
<21-9,ESPOSITO>我知道你很失望
<21-9,ESPOSITO>And I know that you're bummed,

486
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:55,680
<21-9,ESPOSITO>但是你甚至都没有恭喜我通过了
<21-9,ESPOSITO>But you never even gave me props for passing.

487
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,760
<21-10,RYAN>哈维  你说得对
<21-10,RYAN>Yeah. Javi, you're right, man.

488
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,980
<21-10,RYAN>恭喜  兄弟  真的
<21-10,RYAN>Congratulations, man. Really.

489
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:04,320
<21-11,ESPOSITO>谢谢
<21-11,ESPOSITO>Thanks, bro.

490
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,380
<21-12,ESPOSITO>他来了
<21-12,ESPOSITO>Here we go.

491
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:31,700
<22-1,ESPOSITO>你去左边
<22-1,ESPOSITO>Go left.

492
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:02,050
<22-2,RYAN>哈维  你没事吧
<22-2,RYAN>Javi, you okay?

493
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:04,460
<22-3,ESPOSITO>有事  你打中我屁股了
<22-3,ESPOSITO>No! You shot me in the ass!

494
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,250
<23-1,BECKETT>-你打伤了你的搭档  -在屁股上
<23-1,BECKETT>- You shot your partner. - In the ass.

495
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,540
<23-2,HAYLEY>纯属意外
<23-2,HAYLEY>It was an accident.

496
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,600
<23-3,RYAN>医生说他没事的
<23-3,RYAN>The hospital says he's gonna be fine.

497
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:18,670
<23-3,RYAN>只要缝几针就好了
<23-3,RYAN>Just needs a few stitches.

498
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:20,180
<23-4,HAYLEY>还得要一条新裤子
<23-4,HAYLEY>And a new pair of trousers.

499
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,330
<23-5,RYAN>有利亚姆的消息吗
<23-5,RYAN>Any sign of Liam?

500
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:25,380
<23-6,BECKETT>没有  但他是开着劳斯菜斯逃跑的
<23-6,BECKETT>No, but he fled in his Rolls,

501
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:28,670
<23-6,BECKETT>所以我们让维克拉姆监控了
<23-6,BECKETT>so we've got Vikram monitoring every street cam

502
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:29,940
<23-6,BECKETT>城里每个十字路口的监控
<23-6,BECKETT>at every crossing in the city,

503
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,570
<23-6,BECKETT>只要他试图离开曼哈顿
<23-6,BECKETT>which means if he tries to get out of Manhattan,

504
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:32,590
<23-6,BECKETT>我们就能找到他
<23-6,BECKETT>we will find him.

505
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:34,570
<23-7,RYAN>那我去配合他
<23-7,RYAN>Well, I will coordinate with him,

506
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:36,030
<23-7,RYAN>查一下利亚姆的生活
<23-7,RYAN>start digging into Liam's life,

507
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,560
<23-7,RYAN>看能不能找出他的藏身之处
<23-7,RYAN>try and figure out where he might go to ground.

508
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:43,050
<23-8,HAYLEY>你知道利亚姆会丢弃那辆车对吧
<23-8,HAYLEY>You know Liam's gonna ditch the car, right?

509
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:43,650
<23-9,BECKETT>我知道
<23-9,BECKETT>I know.

510
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:45,550
<23-10,HAYLEY>像那样的车肯定能换个好价钱
<23-10,HAYLEY>A ride like that would fetch top dollar.

511
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:48,230
<23-10,HAYLEY>如果利亚姆要逃跑他可能会想快点拿到钱
<23-10,HAYLEY>If Liam's bolting, he might want some quick cash.

512
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,190
<23-11,BECKETT>你要给谁打电话
<23-11,BECKETT>Who are you calling?

513
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,510
<23-12,HAYLEY>你丈夫
<23-12,HAYLEY>Your husband.

514
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:52,610
<23-12,HAYLEY>我想他应该有朋友知道
<23-12,HAYLEY>I reckon that he might have some friends

515
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:55,280
<23-12,HAYLEY>在哪里能迅速把一辆劳斯莱斯卖掉
<23-12,HAYLEY>who would know where to sell a hot rolls in a hurry.

<24-1,MIA>你还在这干嘛
<24-1,MIA>Why are you still here?

00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,830
<24-2,CASTLE>案子还没结呢
<24-2,CASTLE>The case isn't over yet.

518
00:21:58,830 --> 00:21:59,860
<24-3,MIA>但已经不管我的事了
<24-3,MIA>It is for me.

<24-6,CASTLE>I'll ask around. Okay.

524
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,910
<24-6,CASTLE>好了  我们有了新任务

00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,460
<24-7,MIA>这我可帮不了你
<24-7,MIA>I can't help you with that.

528
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:19,090
<24-8,CASTLE>但我们一到那你就可以指认他
<24-8,CASTLE>But you can I.D. him once we get there.

529
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,360
<24-9,MIA>你为什么要这么对我
<24-9,MIA>Why are you doing this to me?

530
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,230
<24-10,CASTLE>因为你帮了我  我现在得报答你
<24-10,CASTLE>Because you helped me out, and now I'm returning the favor.

531
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:25,460
<24-11,MIA>通过折磨我吗
<24-11,MIA>By torturing me?

532
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,670
<24-11,MIA>不是的
<24-11,MIA>No.

533

535
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:34,490
<24-12,CASTLE>我知道你觉得这个世界有点让你承受不来
<24-12,CASTLE>I know you find the world a little overwhelming,

536
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:37,110
<24-12,CASTLE>但在外面  才是真正的生活
<24-12,CASTLE>But out here, this is where life happens.

537
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:40,260
<24-12,CASTLE>所以  我们走吧
<24-12,CASTLE>So...let's go.

572
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,270
<26-15,CARTER>我把画拍下只是因为洛伦佐觉得
<26-15,CARTER>I only bid on it 'cause Lorenzo thought

00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:07,700
<26-15,CARTER>那画挂在我的私人飞机里很好看
<26-15,CARTER>it would look great hanging in my g5.

<26-19,CARTER>他问我是否对一辆二手劳斯莱斯有兴趣
<26-19,CARTER>he asked if I had any interest in a used Rolls-Royce.

<27-4,CASTLE>is going to have to pay out a fortune when I report it.

585
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:41,230
<27-4,CASTLE>我想看看我还能多挣多少
<27-4,CASTLE>Now, how much extra can I look forward to making?

586
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:42,870
<27-5,MECHANIC>我得去查一下
<27-5,MECHANIC>Well, gonna have to run some numbers,

587
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:44,700
<27-5,MECHANIC>但我得看看外国买家愿意出多少
<27-5,MECHANIC>but I'll see what our foreign buyers might pay for it.

588
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,480
<27-6,CASTLE>谢谢
<27-6,CASTLE>Thank you.

589
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:50,000
<27-7,CASTLE>那辆看上去像利亚姆的车
<27-7,CASTLE>Right. That looks like Liam's car right there.

590
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,780
<27-7,CASTLE>去看看
<27-7,CASTLE>Let's go.

00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:57,000
<27-9,MIA>敞篷车  太恶心了
<27-9,MIA>Uh. Convertible -- yuck.

595
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,920
<27-10,CASTLE>好了  你去把后备箱开一下好吗
<27-10,CASTLE>All right, why don't you, uh, pop the trunk?

596
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,930
<27-11,MIA>好的
<27-11,MIA>O-okay.

597
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,270
<27-12,HOLLISTER>你在干什么
<27-12,HOLLISTER>What the hell are you doing?

598
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,220
<27-13,CASTLE>只是看看这辆车而已
<27-13,CASTLE>Oh! Just taking a look at the car.

599
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,130
<27-14,HOLLISTER>-走开  -没问题
<27-14,HOLLISTER>- Yeah, back up. - Hey, no problem.

600
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:19,570
<27-15,CASTLE>好的
<27-15,CASTLE>Yes.

<27-16,HOLLISTER>Hey! Get out of there!

602
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:25,250
<27-17,CASTLE>用不着这样
<27-17,CASTLE>No need for that.

603
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:27,130
<27-18,CASTLE>米娅
<27-18,CASTLE>Mia!

604
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:34,980
<27-19,MIA>我干得不错吧
<27-19,MIA>Did I do okay?

605
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,500
<27-20,CASTLE>简直完美
<27-20,CASTLE>You did perfectly!

606
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:41,160
<28-1,RYAN>我认输了
<28-1,RYAN>I give up.

607
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:44,520
<28-1,RYAN>你们俩怎么把利亚姆困在他的后备箱里
<28-1,RYAN>How the hell did the two of you trap Liam in his own trunk?

608
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:47,070
<28-2,MIA>因为我俩很棒你俩太逊  下个问题
<28-2,MIA>Because we're awesome and you two suck. Next question.

609
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,590
<28-3,CASTLE>你怎么了
<28-3,CASTLE>What -- what happened to you?!

610
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,200
<28-4,ESPOSITO>执行任务时受伤了
<28-4,ESPOSITO>Injured in the line of duty.

611
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:52,480
<28-5,CASTLE>真的吗  怎么搞的
<28-5,CASTLE>Really? How?

612
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,950
<28-6,RYAN>我  不小心冲他开了一枪
<28-6,RYAN>I... accidentally shot him

613
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:57,150
<28-6,RYAN>打到了臀大肌
<28-6,RYAN>in the gluteus maximus.

614
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:58,270
<28-7,CASTLE>屁股上
<28-7,CASTLE>In the ass?!

615
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:00,760
<28-8,CASTLE>或许我应该把这个交给你
<28-8,CASTLE>Well, maybe I should give this to you.

616
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:02,940
<28-9,CASTLE>抱歉  这没什么好笑的
<28-9,CASTLE>I'm sorry. This is so not funny.

617
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,200
<28-10,MIA>没错  简直太搞笑了
<28-10,MIA>You're right. It's hilarious.

618
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,860
<28-10,MIA>笑死人了
<28-10,MIA>It's hilarious!

619
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,170
<28-11,CASTLE>来吧  米娅  我们把这儿交给
<28-11,CASTLE>Come on, Mia. Let's make way for, uh,

620
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:09,980
<28-11,CASTLE>神枪手莱恩和埃斯波西臀
<28-11,CASTLE>Crack-shot Ryan and Assposito.

621
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,230
<28-11,CASTLE>埃斯波西臀
<28-11,CASTLE>"Assposito."

622
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,290
<28-12,ESPOSITO>利亚姆  纽约警察
<28-12,ESPOSITO>Liam, NYPD.

623
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:20,930
<28-12,ESPOSITO>我们现在要打开后备箱  别做傻事
<28-12,ESPOSITO>We're about to open this trunk, so don't do anything stupid.

624
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:27,680
<29-1,HOLLISTER>不是我干的
<29-1,HOLLISTER>It wasn't me!

625
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,470
<29-2,ESPOSITO>我猜不是你拿了那个装着被盗画作的
<29-2,ESPOSITO>So I guess it wasn't you who had the stolen painting

626
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:30,490
<29-2,ESPOSITO>银色箱子
<29-2,ESPOSITO>in the silver briefcase.

627
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:31,700
<29-3,RYAN>我猜也不是你
<29-3,RYAN>I suppose it also wasn't you

628
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,120
<29-3,RYAN>试图在那座大楼里杀掉我们
<29-3,RYAN>who tried to kill us in that building.

629
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,910
<29-4,HOLLISTER>相信我  如果我想杀你们  你们早死了
<29-4,HOLLISTER>Oh, trust me, if I was trying to kill you, you'd be dead.

630
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:39,090
<29-5,ESPOSITO>我只是开火压制你们  好让自己脱身
<29-5,ESPOSITO>Wow. I was laying down a suppressive fire in order to get away.

631
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:41,580
<29-6,HOLLISTER>我故意射偏的  不像你  朋友
<29-6,HOLLISTER>I aimed to miss, unlike you, mate,

632
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:44,370
<29-6,HOLLISTER>你开枪打了自己搭档的屁股
<29-6,HOLLISTER>who shot your own partner in the ass.

633
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:46,330
<29-7,RYAN>好了  不  不要再考虑我们的事
<29-7,RYAN>Okay, l-let's not concern ourselves

634
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:48,310
<29-7,RYAN>包括谁射伤了  埃斯波西臀  托
<29-7,RYAN>with who shot Detective Assp-- Es--

635
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,860
<29-7,RYAN>埃斯波西托警探
<29-7,RYAN>Espo-- Eetective Esposito.

636
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,860
<29-7,RYAN>坐下  立刻  坐下否则我把你关起来
<29-7,RYAN>Sit down now! Sit down or I'm locking you up!

637
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,950
<29-8,HOLLISTER>坐下了
<29-8,HOLLISTER>Over there.

638
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:58,650
<29-9,RYAN>不如  我们讨论一下你是怎么枪杀了贾斯汀
<29-9,RYAN>Rather, let's discuss how you shot Justin.

639
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,050
<29-10,HOLLISTER>告诉你了  不是我干的
<29-10,HOLLISTER>I'm telling you it wasn't me.

640
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:02,210
<29-11,RYAN>我明白  你被激怒了
<29-11,RYAN>Look, I get it. You were pissed.

641
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:04,070
<29-11,RYAN>他在你护送活儿里插了一脚
<29-11,RYAN>He jumped you on that transporter job,

642
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:05,620
<29-11,RYAN>把你踢出了一单大生意
<29-11,RYAN>screwed you out of a big commission.

643
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:06,590
<29-12,ESPOSITO>于是你找到他
<29-12,ESPOSITO>And then you tracked him down,

644
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:07,960
<29-12,ESPOSITO>在停车场跟他对质
<29-12,ESPOSITO>and you confronted him in that garage.

645
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:09,370
<29-12,ESPOSITO>你大概本来没想杀人
<29-12,ESPOSITO>You probably didn't even mean to kill.

646
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:10,320
<29-13,HOLLISTER>我没有杀贾斯汀
<29-13,HOLLISTER>I didn't shoot Justin.

647
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,660
<29-14,ESPOSITO>废话少说
<29-14,ESPOSITO>Cut that crap.

648
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,330
<29-14,ESPOSITO>所有证据都指向你
<29-14,ESPOSITO>All the evidence points to you.

649
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:15,630
<29-15,HOLLISTER>所以我才要躲着你们
<29-15,HOLLISTER>Which is why I ran from you guys.

650
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:17,690
<29-15,HOLLISTER>听着  我当时在那个停车场里
<29-15,HOLLISTER>Look, I was at that parking garage,

651
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:20,050
<29-15,HOLLISTER>但是我离开的时候  贾斯汀还活着
<29-15,HOLLISTER>but when I left, Justin was alive.

652
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,180
<29-15,HOLLISTER>像你说的那样
<29-15,HOLLISTER>It's like you said,

653
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:23,460
<29-15,HOLLISTER>我找贾斯汀对质  他道歉了
<29-15,HOLLISTER>I confronted Justin, but he apologized.

654
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,590
<29-15,HOLLISTER>他知道对不起我
<29-15,HOLLISTER>He knew he did me wrong,

655
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:27,050
<29-15,HOLLISTER>所以他把画还给我了  然后我离开了
<29-15,HOLLISTER>so he gave me back the painting, and I left.

656
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:29,520
<29-15,HOLLISTER>一定是有人在我走之后杀了他
<29-15,HOLLISTER>And someone else must have come after me and shot him.

657
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:31,610
<29-16,RYAN>你真的指望我们相信
<29-16,RYAN>Do you really expect us to believe that?

658
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:32,770
<29-16,RYAN>不
<29-16,RYAN>No.

659
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,200
<29-17,HOLLISTER>但这是事实
<29-17,HOLLISTER>But it's the truth.

660
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:43,040
<30-1,BECKET>这个案子针对利亚姆的证据都是间接的
<30-1,BECKET>This case against Liam is pretty circumstantial.

661
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,390
<30-2,ESPOSITO>希望弹道检测能证实
<30-2,ESPOSITO>Well, hopefully, ballistics can match

662
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:45,570
<30-2,ESPOSITO>他的枪是凶器
<30-2,ESPOSITO>his gun to the murder weapon.

663
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:48,330
<30-3,MIA>我需要吃的  马上
<30-3,MIA>I need food now.

664
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,660
<30-3,MIA>你们要知道  在饿肚子的时候
<30-3,MIA>And just so you know, when hungry,

665
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:53,290
<30-3,MIA>我会有易怒倾向
<30-3,MIA>I do have a tendency to become irritable.

666
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,450
<30-4,CASTLE>你易怒  我才不信呢
<30-4,CASTLE>You irritable? I don't believe it.

667
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:56,890
<30-5,HAYLEY>美极了  不是吗
<30-5,HAYLEY>Beautiful, isn't it?

668
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:58,680
<30-5,HAYLEY>需要多久才能让我把它送回我的雇主那
<30-5,HAYLEY>How long before I can return it to my employer?

669
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,140
<30-6,BECKETT>这个得检察官说了算
<30-6,BECKETT>Well, that's up to the D.A.

670
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,380
<30-7,MIA>这是个赝品  你知道的吧
<30-7,MIA>It's a forgery, you know?

671
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,680
<30-8,HAYLEY>-什么  -你怎么知道
<30-8,HAYLEY>- What? - How do you know?

672
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,590
<30-9,BECKETT>你能闻出来
<30-9,BECKETT>You can smell it.

673
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:08,130
<30-10,MIA>油画需要很多年才能完全干燥
<30-10,MIA>Oil paint takes many years to become fully dry.

674
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:11,490
<30-10,MIA>这幅闻起来太新鲜了  不可能是19世纪的
<30-10,MIA>That smells way too fresh to be from the 19th century.

675
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:13,100
<30-10,MIA>这幅绝对不是杀手
<30-10,MIA>That's definitely not the painting

676
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,680
<30-10,MIA>箱子里的那幅画
<30-10,MIA>that was in the killer's briefcase.

677
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,070
<30-11,ESPOSITO>难道利亚姆说的是真的
<30-11,ESPOSITO>Maybe Liam was telling the truth?

678
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,540
<30-12,RYAN>如说是真的  那就能解释
<30-12,RYAN>If he was, it would explain

679
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:19,080
<30-12,RYAN>为什么贾斯汀那么轻易就放弃了这幅画
<30-12,RYAN>why Justin gave up the painting so easily.

680
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:19,790
<30-12,RYAN>他知道这是赝品
<30-12,RYAN>He knew it was a fake.

681
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:21,900
<30-13,BECKETT>那就意味着真正的凶手还拿着那副真的画
<30-13,BECKETT>Which means the real killer is still out there,

682
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,130
<30-13,BECKETT>逍遥法外
<30-13,BECKETT>with the real painting.

683
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:24,980
<30-14,CASTLE>我爱死剧情反转了
<30-14,CASTLE>Oh, I love it when there's a twist.

684
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,910
<30-15,MIA>我爱死肚子饱饱的了
<30-15,MIA>And I love it when my belly's full.

685
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:28,730
<30-16,CASTLE>我  我这就订外卖
<30-16,CASTLE>I-I'm getting takeout right now.

686
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:29,940
<30-17,MIA>餐厅食品
<30-17,MIA>Restaurant food?

687
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:31,720
<30-17,MIA>绝不
<30-17,MIA>Hell no!

688
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:33,930
<30-17,MIA>我只吃家里做的饭
<30-17,MIA>Home cooking only.

689
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:36,360
<30-17,MIA>所有食物必须用蒸的而且没有
<30-17,MIA>Everything has to be steamed with zero --

690
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,010
<30-17,MIA>我是说完全没有  任何调味料
<30-17,MIA>and I mean zero -- seasoning.

691
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:40,500
<30-17,MIA>如果让我闻到或者看到一粒盐
<30-17,MIA>If I even smell or see a speck of salt,

692
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,850
<30-17,MIA>有人会受伤的
<30-17,MIA>somebody is gonna get hurt.

693
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,120
<30-17,MIA>你是我的司机  卡塞尔  我们走
<30-17,MIA>You're my ride, Castle. Let's go.

694
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,300
<30-18,BECKETT>祝你好胃口  亲爱的
<30-18,BECKETT>Bon appetit, babe.

695
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:48,740
<30-19,CASTLE>拜托
<30-19,CASTLE>Man.

696
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:51,750
<31-1,CASTLE>米娅  如果你想要清淡没味的食物
<31-1,CASTLE>Mia, if you have a hankering for a bland meal,

697
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:53,920
<31-1,CASTLE>我要推荐你  我母亲做的菜
<31-1,CASTLE>I have a treat for you -- my mother's cooking.

00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:55,480
<31-2,MARTHA RODGERS>我听见了  理查德
<31-2,MARTHA RODGERS>I heard that, Richard.

699
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:57,150
<31-2,MARTHA RODGERS>我想你态度应该好一点
<31-2,MARTHA RODGERS>I think gratitude would be appropriate,

700
00:28:57,150 --> 00:29:00,280
<31-2,MARTHA RODGERS>好歹我在给你蒸这顿奇怪的饭
<31-2,MARTHA RODGERS>Since I am steaming this ridiculous meal for you.

701
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:02,430
<31-3,MIA>玛莎·罗杰斯

<31-5,MIA>1999年5月19日
<31-5,MIA>Uh, May 19, 1999.

705
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:10,290
<31-5,MIA>我看过你在《彼平正传》的演出
<31-5,MIA>I saw you perform in "Pippin."

706
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:13,140
<31-6,MARTHA>我的天啊  你记得吗
<31-6,MARTHA>Oh, my go-- you remember that?

707
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:15,530
<31-6,MARTHA>没错  小百老汇
<31-6,MARTHA>Oh, yeah. Off-Off-Broadway.

709
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:19,500
<31-8,MARTHA>所以我说的是小百老汇嘛
<31-8,MARTHA>Off-Off-Broadway, as I said.

710
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,070
<31-8,MARTHA>这真好啊
<31-8,MARTHA>Well, isn't this nice?

711
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:23,670
<31-8,MARTHA>你喜欢我们的剧
<31-8,MARTHA>So you liked the production?

712
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:25,200
<31-9,MIA>不  我讨厌它
<31-9,MIA>No. Hated it.

713
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:26,740
<31-9,MIA>另外  那个剧场闻起来好像
<31-9,MIA>Plus, the theater smelled like

714
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:28,870
<31-9,MIA>炎热夏天存放的比利时干酪肉汤
<31-9,MIA>limburger gravy on a hot summer's day.

715
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:32,350
<31-9,MIA>不过你  你棒极了
<31-9,MIA>But you -- you were amazing.

716
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:35,690
<31-10,CASTLE>真的吗  你一整天和这位畅销作家一起  无感
<31-10,CASTLE>Really? So all day with a best-selling author, nothing.

717
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:36,750
<31-10,CASTLE>和我妈在一起20秒
<31-10,CASTLE>20 seconds with my mother,

718
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,460
<31-10,CASTLE>你就变成泰勒·斯威夫特演唱会上的小女生了
<31-10,CASTLE>You're a tweener at a Taylor Swift concert?

719
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,960
<31-11,MARTHA>别乱喷  理查德
<31-11,MARTHA>Don't be a hater, Richard.

720
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,950
<31-11,MARTHA>这就是戏剧的魅力
<31-11,MARTHA>It's the power of theater.

721
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:43,870
<31-11,MARTHA>继续  慢慢说  你有点太激动了
<31-11,MARTHA>Go on, go on. You were raving.

722
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:46,540
<31-12,MIA>你的表演  太感人了
<31-12,MIA>Your performance -- it was so moving.

723
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:50,920
<31-12,MIA>让我完全忘记了我的真实生活有多糟糕
<31-12,MIA>I completely forgot how horrible my real life was.

724
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:53,400
<31-12,MIA>那简直  那是最美好的一天
<31-12,MIA>It was just -- it was the best day ever.

725
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,430
<31-13,MARTHA>亲爱的
<31-13,MARTHA>Oh! Sweetheart.

726
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,450
<31-14,MIA>而且你几乎没有臭味
<31-14,MIA>Oh! And you barely stink. Oh!

727
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:02,700
<31-15,CASTLE>从她嘴里说出来  这是非常高的评价
<31-15,CASTLE>Oh, coming from her, that's high praise.

728
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,580
<32-1,RYAN>贝克特  我查到一些东西
<32-1,RYAN>Hey, Beckett, I got something.

729
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:07,680
<32-2,ESPOSITO>是我们查到一些东西
<32-2,ESPOSITO>We've got something.

730
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,610
<32-3,RYAN>没错  我正是这么说的
<32-3,RYAN>Yeah, that's what I said.

731
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:10,260
<32-4,ESPOSITO>-你不是那么说的  -好吧  但我就那个意思
<32-4,ESPOSITO>- That's not what you said. - Okay, it's what I meant.

732
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,710
<32-6,BECKETT>好吧  你们只要有一个人告诉我到底是什么事
<32-6,BECKETT>Okay, you both get gold stars for the day

733
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:13,210
<32-6,BECKETT>我今天就给你们俩都发小红花
<32-6,BECKETT>if just one of you can tell me what's going on.

734
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:15,510
<32-7,RYAN>我们查了一下
<32-7,RYAN>We did some digging

735
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:17,590
<32-7,RYAN>这幅油画痛苦的历史
<32-7,RYAN>into this painting's tortured history.

736
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:19,250
<32-8,ESPOSITO>第二次世界大战时被盗
<32-8,ESPOSITO>Stolen during World War II.

737
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:20,320
<32-8,ESPOSITO>被拍卖前
<32-8,ESPOSITO>It ended up in a private collection

738
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,600
<32-8,ESPOSITO>是私人收藏
<32-8,ESPOSITO>before coming up for auction.

739
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,150
<32-9,RYAN>显然  这种被盗的艺术品
<32-9,RYAN>Apparently, stolen artwork like this

740
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:25,310
<32-9,RYAN>很难回到主人的手中
<32-9,RYAN>rarely ends up in the hands of its owner.

741
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:27,340
<32-10,BECKETT>这跟贾斯汀的谋杀案有什么关系
<32-10,BECKETT>What does any of this have to do with Justin's murder?

742
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,160
<32-11,ESPOSITO>大有联系
<32-11,ESPOSITO>Everything.

743
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:30,170
<32-11,ESPOSITO>这幅梵高跟我们认识的一个人有关
<32-11,ESPOSITO>The Van Gogh is connected to somebody we know.

744
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:32,610
<32-13,RYAN>-谁  -两年前  丢失这幅画的那家人
<32-13,RYAN>- Who? - Two years ago, there was a failed legal claim

745
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:34,690
<32-13,RYAN>提起了法律诉讼  却以失败告终
<32-13,RYAN>on behalf of the family that the painting was stolen from.

746
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:36,110
<32-14,ESPOSITO>猜猜这家人是谁
<32-14,ESPOSITO>And guess who filed it.

747
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:40,930
<33-1,MARTHA>你还想吃真是太好了
<33-1,MARTHA>Oh, so glad you wanted a second helping.

748
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:42,880
<33-2,MIA>谢谢  玛莎  太美味了
<33-2,MIA>Thank you, Martha. It's perfect.

749
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,410
<33-3,CASTLE>我想我的味觉都睡着了
<33-3,CASTLE>I think my palate fell asleep.

750
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:48,150
<33-4,MARTHA>那是给咱俩叫的外卖
<33-4,MARTHA>Oh. That will be the takeout for you and me.

751
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:48,950
<33-5,CASTLE>干得漂亮
<33-5,CASTLE>Well done.

752

00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,490
<33-6,CASTLE>妈  你到底点了什么
<33-6,CASTLE>Mother, what exactly did you order?

754
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,540
<34-1,LORENZO>卡塞尔先生  你要跟我走一趟
<34-1,LORENZO>Mr. Castle, you're coming with me.

755
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:02,620
<34-2,MARTHA>不  他才不会跟你走
<34-2,MARTHA>Oh, no, he is not.

756

<34-3,CASTLE>妈  没事  没事
<34-3,CASTLE>Oh, mother, it's -- it's all right.

<34-3,CASTLE>好吧  你是谁
<34-3,CASTLE>Okay, so, uh, who are you?

758
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,820
<34-4,LORENZO>我是谁不重要
<34-4,LORENZO>Who I am's not important.

759
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,820
<34-4,LORENZO>你是谁才重要
<34-4,LORENZO>It's who you are that is.

760
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,220
<34-4,LORENZO>你娶了十二区分局的警监
<34-4,LORENZO>You're married to the captain of the 12th precinct,

761
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:13,160
<34-4,LORENZO>现在有一幅艺术品正保存在那里
<34-4,LORENZO>where a certain work of art is being held.

762
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,580
<34-4,LORENZO>你要去替我拿回来
<34-4,LORENZO>You're going to go and get it for me.

763
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,390
<34-5,CASTLE>给我一个这么做的理由
<34-5,CASTLE>Give me one good reason why I should.

764
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:18,080
<34-6,LORENZO>我给你两个
<34-6,LORENZO>I'll give you two.

765
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:19,020
<34-7,MARTHA>天啊
<34-7,MARTHA>Oh! Oh, my God!

766
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,720
<34-8,CASTLE>好吧  好吧  你把枪指回我
<34-8,CASTLE>Okay, okay. Put -- put the gun back -- back to me.

767
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,910
<34-9,LORENZO>-指着我就好了  -那幅画是属于我们家的
<34-9,LORENZO>- Point it at me. - Look, that painting belongs to my family.

768
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:25,660
<34-9,LORENZO>我父亲终其一生在寻找它
<34-9,LORENZO>My father spent his life trying to find it.

769
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:27,360
<34-9,LORENZO>他去世的时候心已碎
<34-9,LORENZO>He died a broken man.

770
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,570
<34-9,LORENZO>我绝不可能让它
<34-9,LORENZO>There's no way I'm going to let it

771
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:30,550
<34-9,LORENZO>落在某个亿万富豪的窝里
<34-9,LORENZO>sit in some billionaire's man cave.

772
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,330
<34-10,CASTLE>好的  我明白  真的
<34-10,CASTLE>Okay, I get it. I do.

773
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:36,880
<34-10,CASTLE>说真的  我也想帮你
<34-10,CASTLE>And I want to help you, honestly.

774
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:40,450
<34-10,CASTLE>但是即使我愿意  我也拿不到那幅画
<34-10,CASTLE>But I can't get that painting even if I tried.

775
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,830
<34-11,LORENZO>为什么
<34-11,LORENZO>And why is that?

776
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:43,390
<34-12,CASTLE>露西不会让我那么做的
<34-12,CASTLE>Lucy's not gonna let me.

777
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:45,220
<34-13,LORENZO>谁他妈的是露西
<34-13,LORENZO>Who the hell's Lucy?

778
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,230
<34-14,CASTLE>她就在你身后
<34-14,CASTLE>She's right behind you.

779
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:47,780
<34-15,LUCY>准确的说  我在他左边
<34-15,LUCY>Technically, I am to his left.

780
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:59,580
<34-16,CASTLE>你们看到没  我一拳就把他干掉了
<34-16,CASTLE>Did you see that?! Knocked him out with one punch!

781
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,160
<34-17,MARTHA>被干掉的不只他一个人
<34-17,MARTHA>And he wasn't the only one.

782
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,520
<35-1,BECKETT>里克  你还好吧
<35-1,BECKETT>Rick, are you okay?

783
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:21,070
<35-2,CASTLE>一点也不好
<35-2,CASTLE>Far from it.

784
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:23,180
<35-2,CASTLE>我想米娅要告我们
<35-2,CASTLE>I think Mia is gonna sue us

785
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,290
<35-2,CASTLE>让我们赔个倾家荡产
<35-2,CASTLE>for everything we've got.

786
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:26,200
<35-3,MIA>那是  他打断了我挣钱的家伙
<35-3,MIA>Yeah. He broke my money-maker.

787
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:27,790
<35-4,CASTLE>我道过歉了
<35-4,CASTLE>I said I was sorry.

788
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:29,520
<35-5,BECKETT>还有个坏消息
<35-5,BECKETT>Well, uh, there's more bad news.

789
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:32,800
<35-5,BECKETT>洛伦佐不是凶手  我跟他的同事谈过
<35-5,BECKETT>Lorenzo's not our killer. I spoke with his co-workers.

790
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,560
<35-5,BECKETT>他的不在场证明很牢靠
<35-5,BECKETT>He's got a rock-solid alibi.

791
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,430
<35-6,CASTLE>这很合理
<35-6,CASTLE>Well, that makes sense.

792
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:36,870
<35-6,CASTLE>他要是愿意杀贾斯汀的话
<35-6,CASTLE>If he was willing to kill Justin,

793
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:37,890
<35-6,CASTLE>那幅梵高早就到他手上了
<35-6,CASTLE>he'd already have the Van Gogh

794
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:39,460
<35-6,CASTLE>他也就不用让我去偷那幅赝品了
<35-6,CASTLE>and he wouldn't have asked me to steal the fake one.

795
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:42,510
<35-7,LORENZO>等一下  你们找到的梵高是那幅赝品
<35-7,LORENZO>Hold on. The Van Gogh you recovered is the forgery?

796
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:44,500
<35-8,BECKETT>你是怎么知道赝品的事的
<35-8,BECKETT>How do you know about the forgery?

797
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:46,580
<35-8,BECKETT>洛伦佐  你现在麻烦大着呢
<35-8,BECKETT>Lorenzo, you are in a world of trouble.

798
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:49,670
<35-8,BECKETT>你现在最好把你知道的一切都告诉我们
<35-8,BECKETT>Your best bet is to tell us everything you know now.

799
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,020
<35-9,LORENZO>我整个成年时光
<35-9,LORENZO>I have spent my entire adult life

800
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,370
<35-9,LORENZO>都在找寻那幅画
<35-9,LORENZO>searching for that painting.

801
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:54,770
<35-9,LORENZO>当我听说它要被拍卖时
<35-9,LORENZO>When I heard it was coming up for auction,

802
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:56,220
<35-9,LORENZO>我就试图让我老板买下它
<35-9,LORENZO>I tried to get my boss to buy it.

803
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:57,120
<35-10,BECKETT>但他不肯
<35-10,BECKETT>But he wouldn't.

804
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,010
<35-11,LORENZO>是的  但是我在贾斯汀送货时结识了他
<35-11,LORENZO>No, but I knew Justin from some of his deliveries.

805
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:02,890
<35-11,LORENZO>我做了点功课  发现在那幅画被转移前
<35-11,LORENZO>I did some research, learned that we had three weeks

806
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,200
<35-11,LORENZO>我们有三周的时间
<35-11,LORENZO>before the painting was to be moved,

807
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,520
<35-11,LORENZO>于是我们就秘密策划
<35-11,LORENZO>so we hatched a plan.

808
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,700
<35-11,LORENZO>让贾斯汀抢了利亚姆的护送工作
<35-11,LORENZO>Justin would jump Liam's transporter job

809
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,770
<35-11,LORENZO>然后用赝品把那幅梵高换出来
<35-11,LORENZO>and switch the Van Gogh with the fake.

810
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,560
<35-12,BECKETT>而那幅赝品是由你负责提供的
<35-12,BECKETT>And you provided the forgery?

811
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:15,970
<35-13,LORENZO>不  从一开始贾斯汀就说他认识一个人
<35-13,LORENZO>No, from the very beginning, Justin said he knew a guy.

812
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,390
<35-13,LORENZO>所以他才去那个停车场
<35-13,LORENZO>That's why he went to the parking garage --

813
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:20,250
<35-13,LORENZO>去取那幅赝品
<35-13,LORENZO>to pick up the forged painting.

815
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:25,320
<35-14,CASTLE>制造赝品的那个人才是凶手
<35-14,CASTLE>Whoever forged that painting is the killer.

816
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,850
<35-14,CASTLE>他杀害贾斯汀为了得到梵高的真迹
<35-14,CASTLE>He killed Justin for the real Van Gogh.

817
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:29,290
<35-15,BECKETT>但是贾斯汀在停车场把假画给了利亚姆
<35-15,BECKETT>But Justin gave Liam the fake in the parking garage.

818
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:30,090
<35-16,CASTLE>没错  所以呢
<35-16,CASTLE>Yeah, so?

819
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:32,690
<35-17,BECKETT>所以说在利亚姆到达前  画就已经被掉包了
<35-17,BECKETT>So, the exchange happened before Liam even arrived.

820
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:33,940
<35-18,CASTLE>但那并不意味着凶手跑掉了
<35-18,CASTLE>That doesn't mean the killer was gone.

821
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,220
<35-18,CASTLE>他可能只是躲起来了
<35-18,CASTLE>He could have just been hiding.

822
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:38,590
<35-18,CASTLE>要是利亚姆正好在掉包的时候到的呢
<35-18,CASTLE>What if Liam drove up just as the swap was taking place?

823
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:39,780
<35-19,BECKETT>那凶手就只能藏起来
<35-19,BECKETT>Then the killer would take cover.

824
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:42,260
<35-20,CASTLE>没错  所以利亚姆拿着假画走了
<35-20,CASTLE>Right. So Liam drives away with the forgery,

825
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:44,220
<35-20,CASTLE>凶手出来  杀掉贾斯汀  拿走了真迹
<35-20,CASTLE>killer comes back out, kills Justin for the real one.

826
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,400
<35-21,BECKETT>有这个可能
<35-21,BECKETT>That's a possibility.

827
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:49,980
<35-21,BECKETT>那问题就是  我们怎么辨认这个神秘人呢
<35-21,BECKETT>Then the question is, how do we identify this mystery man?

828
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:52,040
<35-22,CASTLE>通过他的味道
<35-22,CASTLE>By his smell.

829
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,230
<35-23,BECKETT>好主意  卡塞尔
<35-23,BECKETT>Well, that's a great idea, Castle,

830
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:56,040
<35-23,BECKETT>不过你把干这事的鼻子给打断了
<35-23,BECKETT>but you literally just broke the nose.

831
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:59,120
<35-24,CASTLE>那就只能靠我们了
<35-24,CASTLE>Well, then, it's up to us.

832
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,670
<36-1,BECKETT>贾斯汀把车停在这里见那个造假的人
<36-1,BECKETT>Justin parked here to meet with the forger,

833
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:08,260
<36-1,BECKETT>也就是说利亚姆肯定是从那边开进来的
<36-1,BECKETT>which means Liam must have driven in from over there.

834
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:10,850
<36-2,CASTLE>所以凶手肯定从这里跑掉
<36-2,CASTLE>So the killer must have headed away from here

835
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,630
<36-2,CASTLE>以防被人看到
<36-2,CASTLE>to avoid being spotted.

836
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:14,340
<36-3,BECKETT>但是  楼梯间是最好的躲藏地点
<36-3,BECKETT>But, you know, the stairwell's the best option,

837
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:16,410
<36-3,BECKETT>可是远在另外一边
<36-3,BECKETT>but that's on the opposite side.

838
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:18,810
<36-4,CASTLE>米娅说凶手身上有卸甲水的味道
<36-4,CASTLE>Mia said the killer smelled like nail-polish remover.

839
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:20,140
<36-5,BECKETT>是的  这也太不寻常了
<36-5,BECKETT>Yeah, which is unusual.

840
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:22,430
<36-6,CASTLE>那是什么声音
<36-6,CASTLE>What is that noise?

841
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:23,990
<36-7,BECKETT>听上去像是一台
<36-7,BECKETT>It sounds like an air-conditioning unit

842
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:25,760
<36-7,BECKETT>快报废的空调设备
<36-7,BECKETT>on its last legs.

843
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,370
<36-8,CASTLE>-就是它了  -是什么
<36-8,CASTLE>- That's it. - What's it?

844
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,050
<36-9,BECKETT>卸甲水
<36-9,BECKETT>Nail-polish remover.

845
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:30,800
<36-10,CASTLE>卸甲水之所以有那样的味道
<36-10,CASTLE>Smells like nail-polish remover

846
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,080
<36-10,CASTLE>是因为它的主要成分  丙酮
<36-10,CASTLE>because of its active ingredient, acetone.

847
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,600
<36-10,CASTLE>空调设备泄露
<36-10,CASTLE>Air-conditioning units leak.

848
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:36,780
<36-10,CASTLE>准确地说是泄露氟利昂
<36-10,CASTLE>Specifically, they leak freon.

849
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:37,670
<36-10,CASTLE>氟利昂闻起来
<36-10,CASTLE>Freon smells...

850
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:39,130
<36-11,BECKETT>像丙酮
<36-11,BECKETT>like acetone.

851
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:42,600
<36-12,BECKETT>凶手一定就站在氟利昂泄露处的旁边
<36-12,BECKETT>The killer must have been standing next to a freon leak.

852
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:45,100
<36-13,CASTLE>他可能离这个柱子非常近
<36-13,CASTLE>He probably squeezed up against this pillar,

853
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,400
<36-13,CASTLE>所以才会有氟利昂沾到他身上
<36-13,CASTLE>and that's how he got the freon transferred onto him.

854
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:50,980
<36-14,BECKETT>而且  这个...
<36-14,BECKETT>And, uh, this...

855
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:54,680
<36-14,BECKETT>很可能就是他的头发
<36-14,BECKETT>may very well be his hair.

856
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:56,350
<36-15,CASTLE>我们有了凶手的DNA
<36-15,CASTLE>We have the killer's DNA.

857
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:02,690
<37-1,ESPOSITO>-多谢你能回来  格雷汉姆  -没什么
<37-1,ESPOSITO>- Thanks for coming back in, Graham. - Not a problem.

858
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:05,230
<37-2,GRAHAM>听说我哥哥的案子有进展了
<37-2,GRAHAM>So, there was an update to my brother's case?

859
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:07,330
<37-2,GRAHAM>是的  贾斯汀
<37-2,GRAHAM>Yeah, uh... Justin.

860
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:10,310
<37-3,RYAN>你大学的学费是他支付的
<37-3,RYAN>Now, he paid your college tuition,

861
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:12,320
<37-3,RYAN>艺术学院  对不对
<37-3,RYAN>didn't he, at the art institute?

862
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:14,300
<37-4,GRAHAM>这和案子有什么关系吗
<37-4,GRAHAM>What's that have to do with anything?

863
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,930
<37-5,ESPOSITO>我们听说你是个出色的画家
<37-5,ESPOSITO>Well, we heard that you were an amazing painter.

864
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:18,510
<37-6,RYAN>据你的教授所说  你很有天赋
<37-6,RYAN>Uh, gifted, according to your professors.

865
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:20,350
<37-7,ESPOSITO>但却是个烂赌鬼
<37-7,ESPOSITO>But a lousy gambler.

866
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:23,210
<37-7,ESPOSITO>没错  我们核实过了
<37-7,ESPOSITO>Yeah. We checked.

867
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,210
<37-7,ESPOSITO>到处都有你的签名和借条
<37-7,ESPOSITO>You had markers and I.O.U.s all over the city.

868
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:27,170
<37-8,RYAN>在地下赌场那种地方
<37-8,RYAN>At underground casinos -- the kind of establishments

869
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:29,880
<37-8,RYAN>他们是不会友善对待你这种还不起钱的人
<37-8,RYAN>that don't take kindly when you can't pay up.

870
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:31,190
<37-9,ESPOSITO>我猜你哥哥让你伪造那幅梵高画的时候
<37-9,ESPOSITO>I bet you thought it was your lucky day

871
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:32,990
<37-9,ESPOSITO>你一定觉得自己遇到天大的好事了
<37-9,ESPOSITO>when your brother asked you to forge that Van Gogh.

872
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,180
<37-10,RYAN>贾斯汀要卖掉那幅原画
<37-10,RYAN>Justin was gonna sell the original painting.

873
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:36,540
<37-10,RYAN>你们两个准备分掉所得的钱
<37-10,RYAN>The two of you would split the profits,

874
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:39,270
<37-10,RYAN>但当你发觉他准备
<37-10,RYAN>but when you found out that he was just gonna

875
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:41,450
<37-10,RYAN>把画送人  你有些生气了
<37-10,RYAN>give that painting away, you got a little pissed.

876
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:42,480
<37-11,GRAHAM>真荒唐
<37-11,GRAHAM>That's ridiculous.

877
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,070
<37-11,GRAHAM>这根本证明不了是我杀了他
<37-11,GRAHAM>I-it doesn't prove that I killed him, either.

878
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:46,410
<37-12,ESPOSITO>的确  不过犯罪现场的头发可以证明
<37-12,ESPOSITO>No, but the hair at the crime scene does.

879
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:47,680
<37-12,ESPOSITO>我们检测了DNA
<37-12,ESPOSITO>We ran the DNA.

880
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,500
<37-12,ESPOSITO>跟你的哥哥有54%相似...
<37-12,ESPOSITO>It's a match to your brother by 54%...

881
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:52,830
<37-12,ESPOSITO>也就是说毛发属于他的兄弟姐妹
<37-12,ESPOSITO>Also known as a sibling match.

882
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:55,700
<37-13,RYAN>你是个赌徒  对吧
<37-13,RYAN>Now, you're a gambling man, right?

883
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:59,170
<37-13,RYAN>如果我们检测这杯子上的毛发DNA
<37-13,RYAN>So how much do you want to bet that when we run that hair

884
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:01,030
<37-13,RYAN>你准备赌多少钱
<37-13,RYAN>against the DNA from this glass...

885
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,310
<37-13,RYAN>会是完全匹配
<37-13,RYAN>It's gonna be an exact match?

886
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:07,980
<37-14,ESPOSITO>我们有你住处的搜查令
<37-14,ESPOSITO>And we have a warrant for your place.

887
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,690
<37-14,ESPOSITO>我们会在你那里找到什么呢
<37-14,ESPOSITO>Now, what are we gonna find there?

888
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,230
<37-14,ESPOSITO>你用的枪
<37-14,ESPOSITO>The gun that you used?

889
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:14,060
<37-14,ESPOSITO>还是那幅梵高的原画呢
<37-14,ESPOSITO>The original Van Gogh?

890
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:20,210
<37-15,GRAHAM>他是我哥哥  我不想杀他的
<37-15,GRAHAM>H-he was my brother. I-I-I didn't want to kill him.

891
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:21,840
<37-15,GRAHAM>我只是  我需要钱
<37-15,GRAHAM>I just -- I-I needed the money.

892
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,360
<38-1,BECKETT>你能看出区别来吗
<38-1,BECKETT>So, can you tell the difference?

893
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:32,240
<38-1,BECKETT>完全看不出来
<38-1,BECKETT>Uh...no. Not at all.

894
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:35,490
<38-2,HAYLEY>我跟画作的现任主人谈过了
<38-2,HAYLEY>Oh, I, uh, spoke to the current owner,

895
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:37,990
<38-2,HAYLEY>把整件事都告诉了他  他表示
<38-2,HAYLEY>told him the whole story, and he pledged

896
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:39,600
<38-2,HAYLEY>只要洛伦佐家的案子一宣判
<38-2,HAYLEY>that he's going to give it to the State Museum

897
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,550
<38-2,HAYLEY>他就把这幅画献给国家博物馆
<38-2,HAYLEY>while Lorenzo's family's issue is being adjudicated.

898
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,460
<38-2,HAYLEY>所以  算是个好的结尾吧
<38-2,HAYLEY>So, bit of a happy ending.

899
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,690
<38-3,BECKETT>很高兴跟你合作
<38-3,BECKETT>Well, it was a pleasure working with you.

900
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:47,820
<38-4,HAYLEY>我也是
<38-4,HAYLEY>Yeah. You too.

901
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,740
<38-4,HAYLEY>身为警察  你是个好人
<38-4,HAYLEY>You're not so bad for a cop.

902
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:52,750
<38-5,BECKETT>谢谢  你也是个好人  作为一个...
<38-5,BECKETT>Thank you. You're not so bad for a-a...

903
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,090
<38-5,BECKETT>你到底是做什么工作的
<38-5,BECKETT>What -- what exactly do you do?

904
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:01,090
<39-1,RYAN>你需要帮忙吗
<39-1,RYAN>Hey, you need any help?

905
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:02,010
<39-2,ESPOSITO>不劳烦你
<39-2,ESPOSITO>Not from you.

906
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:04,040
<39-3,RYAN>哈维
<39-3,RYAN>Javi, look...

907
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,650
<39-3,RYAN>你能宽宏大量原谅我吗
<39-3,RYAN>...could you find it in your heart to forgive me?

908
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,760
<39-4,ESPOSITO>好吧
<39-4,ESPOSITO>All right.

909
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:16,860
<39-5,RYAN>我们没事了吗
<39-5,RYAN>We're cool?

910
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:18,530
<39-6,ESPOSITO>是的
<39-6,ESPOSITO>Yeah.

911
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:24,500
<39-7,RYAN>对不起
<39-7,RYAN>I'm sorry.

912
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:25,850
<39-7,RYAN>对不起
<39-7,RYAN>I'm sorry.

913
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,090
<39-8,ESPOSITO>怎么  难道你不是故意的吗
<39-8,ESPOSITO>What, like you didn't mean to do that?

914
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:29,380
<39-9,RYAN>那是个意外
<39-9,RYAN>Th-that was an accident!

915
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,020
<39-10,ESPOSITO>似乎最近身边的意外
<39-10,ESPOSITO>Well, it seems like there's been a lot of accidents

916
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:32,760
<39-10,ESPOSITO>有点多啊  探长
<39-10,ESPOSITO>around here lately, detective.

917

<39-20,BECKETT>如果你们俩私底下不能解决的话
<39-20,BECKETT>If the two of you can't figure this out on your own,

932
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:04,580
<39-20,BECKETT>那就去见心理医生  这是命令
<39-20,BECKETT>then you're doing it in therapy, and that's an order --

<39-20,BECKETT>什么借口都没有用
<39-20,BECKETT>No ifs, ands, or buts.

<40-2,MIA>医生说肿消了
<40-2,MIA>Oh, the doctor said my schnoz should go back to normal

950
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,590
<40-9,MIA>知道吗  我闻不到你身上味道的时候
<40-9,MIA>You know what? You're easier to be around

951
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:01,890
<40-9,MIA>更好跟你相处
<40-9,MIA>when I can't smell you.

00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,930
<41-1,MIA>我的职业
<41-1,MIA>I've spent my career

959
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:37,570
<41-1,MIA>但那些都是伪造的
<41-1,MIA>but they're all just forgeries...

960
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:39,900
<41-1,MIA>就跟那幅画一样
