<3-11,LOPEZ>八字还没一撇呢
<3-11,LOPEZ>A little too soon for that kind of talk,

<3-15,CARL SHELDON>你对自己的抱负很含蓄啊  亚历克斯
<3-15,CARL SHELDON>You're being very coy about your aspirations, Alex.

127
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:06,970
<3-15,CARL SHELDON>很显然你有很大的抱负
<3-15,CARL SHELDON>But you obviously have some,

128
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,170
<3-15,CARL SHELDON>-否则你也不会来这了  -目前来说
<3-15,CARL SHELDON>- or you wouldn't be here. - Well, for now,

<3-17,SHELDON>我说话很直接
<3-17,SHELDON>Being coy isn't in my nature.

131
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:15,010
<3-17,SHELDON>你还有你的想法并不是这个国家所需要的
<3-17,SHELDON>You and your ideas aren't what this country needs,

132
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:17,590
<3-17,SHELDON>我一定不会让你当上总统的

<4-5,RYAN>我的视线就离开了一秒钟
<4-5,RYAN>I took my eyes off him for one second.

180
00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:59,620
<4-6,FRANK>不不不  凯文  我们会找到枪手的
<4-6,FRANK>No, no, no, kev. We are gonna find this shooter.

<4-6,FRANK>纽约警察把周围十个街区都封锁了
<4-6,FRANK>NYPD sealed off 10 square blocks from this place.

182
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:03,490
<4-7,RYAN>-有人知道枪手的样子吗  -只有你描述的
<4-7,RYAN>- Did we get a description? - Only the one you gave us...

<4-9,RYAN>Come on. No one saw his face?

185
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:08,890
<4-10,FRANK>看见了  不过都太惊慌了  没记住
<4-10,FRANK>Yeah, they did, but they were too busy panicking to remember.

186
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,400
<4-11,FRANK>你来回忆一下刚才的事好吗
<4-11,FRANK>Look, why don't we walk through what happened?

187
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,300
<4-12,RYAN>不用了  弗兰克  我已经回忆过了
<4-12,RYAN>No, Frank. I already did that.

188
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:16,890
<4-13,FRANK>再回忆一遍又没害处
<4-13,FRANK>And what's the harm in doing it again?

189
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,920
<4-13,FRANK>好吧
<4-13,FRANK>Yeah.

190

<4-14,RYAN>枪响了  有三声
<4-14,RYAN>Shots rang out, three of 'em.

192
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:28,730
<4-14,RYAN>我扑向洛佩兹  也把卡洛琳带倒了
<4-14,RYAN>I-I-I dove onto Lopez, took Carolyn down, too.

193
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,860
<4-14,RYAN>我看见他们受伤了  这时你来了
<4-14,RYAN>I saw they were hit. That's when you came in.

194
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:34,510
<4-16,RYAN>然后我发现了枪手  不过只看到他的背影
<4-16,RYAN>And then I spotted the shooter. And I only ever saw the back.

195
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:36,250
<4-17,FRANK>好吧  想想他的手
<4-17,FRANK>All right, think about his hands.

196
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,250
<4-17,FRANK>有没有戴戒指  手表什么的
<4-17,FRANK>Rings on his fingers, a watch?

<4-18,RYAN>是的  他脖子上挂着一张淡蓝色的身份卡
<4-18,RYAN>Yeah, he had a pale-blue I.D. card hanging from his neck.

201
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:51,800
<4-18,RYAN>他有媒体通行证
<4-18,RYAN>This guy had a press pass.

207
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:08,230
<4-24,BECKETT>不行  凯文  这事不能等
<4-24,BECKETT>No. Kev, this can't wait.

<4-30,RYAN>不不  没用  我没看到枪手的脸
<4-30,RYAN>No, no. There's no point. I never saw the shooter's face.

216
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,830
<4-2,FRANK>不过

00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,510
<5-2,RYAN>我很遗憾  先生
<5-2,RYAN>I'm very sorry, sir.

<5-4,RYAN>-那张卡是谁的  -谁的也不是
<5-4,RYAN>- Who did it belong to? - No one.

229
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,790
<5-6,RYAN>什么叫"谁的也不是"
<5-6,RYAN>What do you mean, "No one"?

230
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,320
<5-7,FRANK>保安有多余的通行证
<5-7,FRANK>Event security kept extra passes on hold

231
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,260
<5-7,FRANK>留给那些临时出现的人
<5-7,FRANK>for last-minute attendees.

232
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:39,030
<5-7,FRANK>枪手不知道从哪弄到了一张
<5-7,FRANK>So somehow our shooter got ahold of one.

00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,410
<5-8,RYAN>-该死的  -是啊

<6-1,CASTLE>他明白那不是他的错  对吧
<6-1,CASTLE>He knows it's not his fault, right?

236
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:45,990
<6-2,BECKETT>毕竟是在他眼皮底下发生的
<6-2,BECKETT>Well, it happened on his watch.

237
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:48,060
<6-2,BECKETT>对他来说  在找到凶手之前
<6-2,BECKETT>So for Ryan, it means it's all on him

238
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,900
<6-2,BECKETT>一切都要算在他头上
<6-2,BECKETT>until he finds this guy.

239
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,960
<6-3,JIM BOYCE>贝克特探长  我是吉姆·博伊斯  州党主席
<6-3,JIM BOYCE>Detective Beckett, Jim Boyce, state party chair.

240
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,500
<6-3,JIM BOYCE>这整件事真是太可怕了
<6-3,JIM BOYCE>This whole thing is just terrible.

241
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:55,840
<6-3,JIM BOYCE>有什么消息吗
<6-3,JIM BOYCE>Is...there any news?

242
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,510
<6-4,BECKETT>我们正在竭尽全力逮捕嫌疑人
<6-4,BECKETT>Just that we're doing everything we can to apprehend the suspect.

243
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,770
<6-5,BOYCE>我很高兴是你接手了这案子
<6-5,BOYCE>Well, I'm glad that you're the one handling the case.

244
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,120
<6-6,BECKETT>抱歉  博伊斯先生  我们认识吗
<6-6,BECKETT>I'm sorry, Mr. Boyce. Do we know each other?

245
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,550
<6-7,BOYCE>不  但你盛名在外
<6-7,BOYCE>No, but you have an outstanding reputation,

246
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:08,290
<6-7,BOYCE>连我身边的人都知道
<6-7,BOYCE>and it's gotten the attention of the people in my world.

247
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,940
<6-7,BOYCE>我就不耽误你了  探长
<6-7,BOYCE>I won't hold you, detective.

248
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,790
<6-8,BECKETT>-幸会  -彼此彼此
<6-8,BECKETT>- Pleasure to meet you. - Yeah, likewise.

249
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,300
<6-9,CASTLE>什么情况
<6-9,CASTLE>What was that about?

250
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:16,130
<6-10,BECKETT>不知道
<6-10,BECKETT>I have no idea.

251
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:19,540
<7-1,LOPEZ>也许我们能以卡洛琳的名义建立一个基金
<7-1,LOPEZ>Maybe we can set up a foundation in Carolyn's name.

252
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:23,320
<7-2,MIA>好的  奖学金之类的
<7-2,MIA>Yes, let's do that. Like a-a scholarship fund.

253
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:26,030
<7-3,MEGAN>不如我去查查  然后给你们意见吧
<7-3,MEGAN>Why don't I look into that and get back to you with options.

254
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:27,300
<7-4,LOPEZ>那真是再好不过了  布鲁克斯
<7-4,LOPEZ>That would be great, Megan.

255
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:29,960
<7-5,BECKETT>洛佩兹议员  我是贝克特探长
<7-5,BECKETT>Congressman Lopez, I'm detective Beckett.

256
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,510
<7-5,BECKETT>这位是卡塞尔先生
<7-5,BECKETT>This is Mr. Castle.

257
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:34,070
<7-5,BECKETT>我们在调查枪击案
<7-5,BECKETT>We're investigating the shooting.

258
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:35,740
<7-6,LOPEZ>作为一名政客
<7-6,LOPEZ>You know, as a politician...

259
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,820
<7-6,LOPEZ>你一早就知道可能会受到伤害
<7-6,LOPEZ>...you know in the back of your mind that harm may come to you,

260
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,290
<7-6,LOPEZ>但绝不该殃及到无辜的人
<7-6,LOPEZ>But it should never come to an innocent bystander.

261
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:43,040
<7-7,BECKETT>议员先生  案发之前您有留意到
<7-7,BECKETT>Congssman, did you notice anything

262
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,930
<7-7,BECKETT>任何可疑的人或事吗
<7-7,BECKETT>or anyone suspicious prior to the shooting?

263
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,870
<7-8,LOPEZ>一切都很正常
<7-8,LOPEZ>Everything seemed normal.

264
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,030
<7-9,BECKETT>-直到出事  -我们确信枪击
<7-9,BECKETT>- Until it wasn't. - Well, we believe that the shots originated

265
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:57,820
<7-9,BECKETT>来自舞台的最北边
<7-9,BECKETT>from the north end of the backstage area.

266
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:58,900
<7-10,CASTLE>也就是你跟卡洛琳·戴克交谈时
<7-10,CASTLE>That's the direction you were facing

267
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,540
<7-10,CASTLE>你正对着的方向
<7-10,CASTLE>when you were speaking with Carolyn Decker.

268
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,500
<7-11,BECKETT>你有注意到后面有任何可疑的人吗
<7-11,BECKETT>Did you notice anyone in the background?

269
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,410
<7-12,LOPEZ>我看到了
<7-12,LOPEZ>I saw...

270
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:08,260
<7-12,LOPEZ>舞台工作人员  制作团队...
<7-12,LOPEZ>stagehands, production crew...

271
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:10,700
<7-12,LOPEZ>有一个人
<7-12,LOPEZ>There was this one guy.

272
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:11,890
<7-13,CASTLE>他穿的什么
<7-13,CASTLE>What was he wearing?

273
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:13,860
<7-14,LOPEZ>灰色西装
<7-14,LOPEZ>A gray suit.

274
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,260
<7-14,LOPEZ>是他吗
<7-14,LOPEZ>Is that him?

275
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,750
<7-14,LOPEZ>就是他杀了卡洛琳吗
<7-14,LOPEZ>Is that the man that killed Carolyn?

276
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,780
<7-15,BECKETT>你有看到他的样貌吗  能形容一下吗
<7-15,BECKETT>Did you see his face? Can you describe him?

277
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:30,250
<7-16,LOPEZ>我记得一清二楚
<7-16,LOPEZ>I can most definitely describe him.

278
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,060
<8-1,ESPOSITO>这就是我们要找的人  艾里克·钱伯斯
<8-1,ESPOSITO>This is our guy, Eric Chambers...

279
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,960
<8-1,ESPOSITO>边缘博客写手  极端的政治活动者
<8-1,ESPOSITO>Fringe blogger and political activist with some pretty extreme ideas.

280
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,610
<8-2,BECKETT>他跟画像的确很相像
<8-2,BECKETT>Okay, he looks like the sketch,

281
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:39,230
<8-2,BECKETT>但他有出现在犯罪现场吗
<8-2,BECKETT>But can we place him at the crime scene?

282
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:41,950
<8-3,ESPOSITO>鉴证组在墙上发现了他的指纹  他当时在场
<8-3,ESPOSITO>CSU pulled chambers' print off the wall, so he was there.

283
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:42,800
<8-3,ESPOSITO>绝对是他
<8-3,ESPOSITO>It's definitely him.

284
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,790
<8-4,CASTLE>我猜他不太支持洛佩兹吧
<8-4,CASTLE>I'm guessing he's not a big supporter of Lopez?

285
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:45,910
<8-5,ESPOSITO>这么形容可太轻了
<8-5,ESPOSITO>That's an understatement.

286
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:48,140
<8-5,ESPOSITO>两周前  他在博客上痛骂了洛佩兹
<8-5,ESPOSITO>Two weeks ago, chambers ranted on his blog

287
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:50,820
<8-5,ESPOSITO>说他威胁到了美国人的生活方式
<8-5,ESPOSITO>about how Lopez posed a threat to the American way of life

288
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,600
<8-5,ESPOSITO>还说他将得到叛国者应得的报应
<8-5,ESPOSITO>and that he would get what all traitors deserve.

289
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,330
<8-7,ESPOSITO>-钱伯斯现在在哪  -他最近的地址在包厘街
<8-7,ESPOSITO>- Where is Chambers now? His last known address was in the bowery.

290
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:57,900
<8-8,BECKETT>-战术组已经去了  -带上莱恩
<8-8,BECKETT>- Tactical's gearing up. - Take Ryan.

291
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,790
<8-8,BECKETT>你们逮捕钱伯斯时应该让他在场
<8-8,BECKETT>He should be there when you pick Chambers up.

292
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:17,030
<9-1,ESPOSITO>战术组还有三分钟就到
<9-1,ESPOSITO>Tactical's about three minutes out.

293
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,380
<9-2,RYAN>我们怎么确定钱伯斯在家
<9-2,RYAN>How do we know Chambers is at home?

294
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,530
<9-3,ESPOSITO>托瑞锁定了他的手机  他就在里面
<9-3,ESPOSITO>Tory pinged his cell. He's in there.

295
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:29,400
<9-4,ESPOSITO>哥们儿  我们会抓住他的
<9-4,ESPOSITO>Hey, bro. We're gonna get this guy.

296
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,190
<9-6,RYAN>就是他
<9-6,RYAN>There he is.

297
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:53,180
<9-7,RYAN>他要跑
<9-7,RYAN>He's on the move!

298
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,100
<9-8,ESPOSITO>钱伯斯  不许动
<9-8,ESPOSITO>Chambers, freeze!

299
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,350
<9-8,ESPOSITO>钱伯斯
<9-8,ESPOSITO>Chambers!

300
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:06,900
<9-8,ESPOSITO>放开我
<9-8,ESPOSITO>Get the hell off me!

301
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,660
<9-9,RYAN>你们不能这样
<9-9,RYAN>You can't do this!

302
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,060
<9-9,RYAN>给我个理由杀你啊
<9-9,RYAN>Give me a reason!

303
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:14,690
<9-10,ESPOSITO>艾里克·钱伯斯  你被捕了
<9-10,ESPOSITO>Eric Chambers, you're under arrest.

304
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,800
<9-10,ESPOSITO>我们抓到他了  莱恩  没事了
<9-10,ESPOSITO>We got him, Ryan. We're good.

305
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,430
<10-1,BECKETT>钱伯斯先生  你将面临谋杀
<10-1,BECKETT>Mr. Chambers, you are facing charges for murder

306
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:25,440
<10-1,BECKETT>和企图刺杀国会议员未遂的指控
<10-1,BECKETT>and the attempted assassination of a congressman.

307
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,120
<10-1,BECKETT>争取宽大的最好办法就是坦白认罪
<10-1,BECKETT>Your best hope for leniency is to confess.

308
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:32,100
<10-2,ERIC CHAMBERS>我不会认罪的  我不会满足你们的
<10-2,ERIC CHAMBERS>I'll never confess. I won't give you the satisfaction.

309
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,220
<10-3,BECKETT>那你不如将这当做一次机会
<10-3,BECKETT>Okay, why don't you consider this a chance

310
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,790
<10-3,BECKETT>从你的角度说说怎么回事吧
<10-3,BECKETT>to tell your side of the story?

311
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:37,800
<10-4,CHAMBERS>我的角度就是我是无辜的
<10-4,CHAMBERS>My side of the story is that I'm innocent.

312
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,810
<10-4,CHAMBERS>这一切都是假的
<10-4,CHAMBERS>This is all a charade.

313
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:40,910
<10-5,CASTLE>证据显示可不是如此
<10-5,CASTLE>The evidence would suggest otherwise.

314
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,600
<10-6,BECKETT>我们在你的公寓发现了这张被偷的记者证
<10-6,BECKETT>We found this stolen press pass at your apartment

315
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,920
<10-6,BECKETT>还有一张舞厅的平面图
<10-6,BECKETT>along with a floor plan of the ballroom.

316
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,910
<10-7,CASTLE>并且你在枪击发生后就逃离了现场
<10-7,CASTLE>Then there's the pesky issue of you fleeing after firing the shots.

317
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,870
<10-8,CHAMBERS>一个真正的爱国者  从定义上就是国家的敌人
<10-8,CHAMBERS>A true patriot, by definition, is an enemy of the state.

318
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:57,740
<10-8,CHAMBERS>我们的政府在起诉我这样的人方面
<10-8,CHAMBERS>Our government has a long and sorry history

319
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,590
<10-8,CHAMBERS>可有着悠久而不堪的历史
<10-8,CHAMBERS>of persecuting people like me.

320
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:02,210
<10-9,BECKETT>这么说  你还成被害人了
<10-9,BECKETT>So, you are the victim here?

321
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:05,060
<10-10,CHAMBERS>而你们就是他们用来摧毁我的工具
<10-10,CHAMBERS>And you're the instrument they're using to try to destroy me.

322
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,790
<10-10,CHAMBERS>你们太盲目了  看不到这其实是个剧本
<10-10,CHAMBERS>You're too blind to see that this is a script.

323
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:09,520
<10-10,CHAMBERS>你们只是在扮演其中的角色
<10-10,CHAMBERS>You're just playing your part.

324
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:12,350
<10-11,CASTLE>这就是最让我不解的地方了
<10-11,CASTLE>Um, okay, here's the part that fascinate me.

325
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:14,660
<10-11,CASTLE>你恨洛佩兹  你希望他死
<10-11,CASTLE>You hated Lopez. You wanted him dead.

326
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:15,590
<10-11,CASTLE>所以你开枪打了他
<10-11,CASTLE>So you shot him.

327
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:17,530
<10-11,CASTLE>虽然并没致命
<10-11,CASTLE>Not fatally, it turns out.

328
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:21,370
<10-11,CASTLE>但你仍为各地的"真正的爱国者"发出了一击
<10-11,CASTLE>But still, you struck a blow for "True patriots" everywhere.

329
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:24,730
<10-11,CASTLE>这不正是你此生最荣耀的时刻吗  艾里克
<10-11,CASTLE>Isn't this the proudest moment of your life, Eric?

330
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:26,140
<10-11,CASTLE>为什么不承认呢
<10-11,CASTLE>I mean, why not own it?

331
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:28,800
<10-11,CASTLE>为什么不承认你的壮举呢
<10-11,CASTLE>Why not take credit for what you've accomplished?

332
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,830
<10-12,BECKETT>你希望上庭  这样就会有人开论坛纪念你了
<10-12,BECKETT>You want your day in court so you can have a public forum.

333
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:37,030
<10-13,CHAMBERS>我没什么好说的了
<10-13,CHAMBERS>I'm done here.

334
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,480
<11-1,BECKETT>钱伯斯不肯开口
<11-1,BECKETT>Chambers isn't talking.

335
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,720
<11-2,RYAN>可能不重要了
<11-2,RYAN>Well, that may not matter.

336
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,010
<11-2,RYAN>我们应该发现犯罪用枪了
<11-2,RYAN>I think we literally just found the smoking gun.

337
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:47,380
<11-3,ESPOSITO>听好  警员在
<11-3,ESPOSITO>Get this...UNIs found

338
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,390
<11-3,ESPOSITO>离酒店大约一个街区距离的雨水沟里
<11-3,ESPOSITO>a.38-caliber pistol in a storm drain

339
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:51,560
<11-3,ESPOSITO>发现了一把0.38口径的手枪  最近才开过
<11-3,ESPOSITO>about a block away from the hotel, recently fired.

340
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,600
<11-4,CASTLE>-活动场地不是有金属探测器吗  -对
<11-4,CASTLE>- Weren't there metal detectors at the venue? - Yeah.

341
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,510
<11-5,ESPOSITO>也就是说枪可能是早就藏在酒店里
<11-5,ESPOSITO>Which means that the gun might have been waiting for him,

342
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:57,550
<11-6,RYAN>-等着他去取的  -还有记者证
<11-6,RYAN>- stashed at the hotel. - Along with the press pass.

343
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,940
<11-7,CASTLE>也就是说  他不是独自作案的
<11-7,CASTLE>So, that suggests he wasn't acting alone.

344
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,970
<11-8,BECKETT>洛佩兹可能仍是他同伙的目标
<11-8,BECKETT>And Lopez might still be a target.

345
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:04,030
<11-9,ESPOSITO>我去打给医院加强警戒
<11-9,ESPOSITO>I'll call down to the hospital and beef up security.

346
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:07,350
<11-10,BECKETT>如果弄清钱伯斯在案发现场的行动
<11-10,BECKETT>If we can reconstruct Chambers' movements from the venue,

347
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:09,260
<11-10,BECKETT>也许就能知道他是如何弄到的枪
<11-10,BECKETT>we might be able to figure out how he got that gun.

348
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,660
<11-11,CASTLE>还能找到他的共犯
<11-11,CASTLE>And who he was working with.

349
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,500
<11-12,RYAN>在我们试图确认钱伯斯的身份时
<11-12,RYAN>You know, when we were trying to I.D. Chambers,

350
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,690
<11-12,RYAN>我们收集了活动的数百张照片
<11-12,RYAN>we rounded up hundreds of photos from that event.

351
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:16,130
<11-12,RYAN>我想我知道怎么找
<11-12,RYAN>I think I know where to start.

352
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:18,020
<12-1,TORY ELLIS>有些是摄影师拍的
<12-1,TORY ELLIS>Some were taken by photographers,

353
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,970
<12-1,TORY ELLIS>其他是客人用手机拍的
<12-1,TORY ELLIS>others by guests on their cellphones.

354
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:22,880
<12-1,TORY ELLIS>我用了面部扫描系统试着搜索钱伯斯
<12-1,TORY ELLIS>I used facial recognition to try and search for Chambers.

355
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,750
<12-2,RYAN>找到他了吗
<12-2,RYAN>Did you find him?

356
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,260
<12-3,TORY>14张照片中有他  大多都在背景中
<12-3,TORY>He appears in 14 pictures, mostly in the background.

357
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,930
<12-3,TORY>因为每张照片都有时间戳
<12-3,TORY>Since each photo is time-stamped,

358
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:30,430
<12-3,TORY>所以可以构架出他在现场的行动
<12-3,TORY>I was able to plot his movement at the venue.

359
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:34,110
<12-3,TORY>每个点就代表钱伯斯被拍到的位置
<12-3,TORY>Each dot represents where Chambers was photographed.

360
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:36,160
<12-4,RYAN>照片中有人曾交给过他东西吗
<12-4,RYAN>Does anyone in the photos ever hand him something?

361
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,170
<12-4,RYAN>他有拿到过手枪大小的东西吗
<12-4,RYAN>Does he ever retrieve an object the size of a gun?

362
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:41,310
<12-5,TORY>恐怕没有  但有五分钟钱伯斯的
<12-5,TORY>I'm afraid not, but there is a five-minute gap

363
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,270
<12-5,TORY>行动是未知的
<12-5,TORY>when chambers is unaccounted for.

364
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:47,250
<12-5,TORY>这是缺失时段前的最后一张照片
<12-5,TORY>This is the last photo before the missing time.

365
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:50,530
<12-6,RYAN>那个门通向一个储藏间
<12-6,RYAN>That door leads to a storage area.

366
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:52,760
<12-7,TORY>-也许枪就藏在里面  -不不不
<12-7,TORY>- Then maybe that's where the gun was stashed. - No. No, no.

367
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,720
<12-8,RYAN>按照安全规程  晚宴时那扇门
<12-8,RYAN>Security protocol would have had that door locked

368
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,630
<12-9,TORY>-该是锁上的  -但这间没有锁
<12-9,TORY>- for the evening. - Well, this room wasn't locked.

369
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:59,720
<12-9,TORY>这个时段左右还有一张照片拍到了这里
<12-9,TORY>Here's another picture of it taken around the same time.

370
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:04,840
<12-10,RYAN>那个人是酒店的工作人员
<12-10,RYAN>That guy works for the hotel.

371
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:07,020
<12-10,RYAN>如果那扇门应该是锁着的
<12-10,RYAN>If that door was supposed to be locked,

372
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,430
<12-10,RYAN>那他进去是要做什么
<12-10,RYAN>what was he doing in there?

373
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,310
<13-1,RYAN>朱利安·贝利
<13-1,RYAN>Julian Bailey?

374
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:14,870
<13-2,JULIAN BAILEY>有事吗
<13-2,JULIAN BAILEY>Yes?

375
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:15,700
<13-3,ESPOSITO>你介意告诉我们
<13-3,ESPOSITO>Do you mind telling us

376
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,640
<13-3,ESPOSITO>昨晚你进储藏间做什么去了吗
<13-3,ESPOSITO>what you were doing in the storage room last night?

377
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,400
<13-4,JULIAN>我没进什么储藏间
<13-4,JULIAN>I wasn't in any storage room.

378
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,670
<13-5,RYAN>那么这是谁  你的邪恶双胞胎吗
<13-5,RYAN>Oh, then who's this? Your evil twin?

379
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,860
<13-6,JULIAN>好吧
<13-6,JULIAN>Okay, yeah.

380
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:28,720
<13-6,JULIAN>我溜进去见了个女孩
<13-6,JULIAN>I snuck in there for a girl, you know?

381
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,980
<13-6,JULIAN>我们约在那里见  但她却没来
<13-6,JULIAN>We were gonna meet up, but she never showed.

382
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:33,590
<13-7,RYAN>好吧  你见过这个人吗
<13-7,RYAN>All right. Have you seen this guy?

383
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:36,350
<13-8,JULIAN>他倒是进来了
<13-8,JULIAN>Yeah, he came in the room.

384
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,550
<13-8,JULIAN>我是不该进那间屋子的
<13-8,JULIAN>I wasn't supposed to be there,

385
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,300
<13-9,RYAN>-所以我就藏起来了  -他进去干了什么
<13-9,RYAN>- so I hid. - What was he doing in the room?

386
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,020
<13-9,RYAN>在找东西吗  他是不是拿了把枪
<13-9,RYAN>Was he looking for something? Did he have a gun?

387
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,320
<13-10,JULIAN>枪  不是  他和另一个人在一起
<13-10,JULIAN>A gun? No, he was with another dude.

388
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,930
<13-10,JULIAN>他们在很紧张的交谈
<13-10,JULIAN>They were talking all intense.

389
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,180
<13-11,CARL SHELTON>关于何时何地
<13-11,CARL SHELTON>We have to be smart

390
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:48,880
<13-11,CARL SHELTON>干掉洛佩兹我们必须要谨慎
<13-11,CARL SHELTON>about when and where we bring Mr. Lopez down.

391
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,370
<13-12,CHAMBERS>我都计划好了  好吗
<13-12,CHAMBERS>I've got it covered, okay?

392
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:52,500
<13-12,CHAMBERS>洛佩兹会得到报应的
<13-12,CHAMBERS>Lopez is gonna get what's coming to him.

393
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,470
<14-1,ESPOSITO>你之前怎么不说这事
<14-1,ESPOSITO>And you didn't think to mention this before?

394
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,130
<14-2,JULIAN>我害怕被解雇
<14-2,JULIAN>I was afraid I'd get fired.

395
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:57,740
<14-2,JULIAN>再说  等我意识到
<14-2,JULIAN>Plus, by the time I realized he was the one

396
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,870
<14-2,JULIAN>他就是枪击了议员的人时  你们都抓到他了
<14-2,JULIAN>who shot the congressman, you guys had already caught him.

397
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:01,760
<14-3,RYAN>好吧  和他交谈的另一个人
<14-3,RYAN>All right, this other dude that he was talking to,

398
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,150
<14-3,RYAN>你看到他的脸了吗
<14-3,RYAN>did you see his face?

399
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,600
<14-4,JULIAN>他们出门的一瞬间看到了一下
<14-4,JULIAN>Just for a second as the two of them were walking out.

400
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,540
<14-4,JULIAN>卡尔·谢尔顿
<14-4,JULIAN>Carl Shelton?

401
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,980
<15-1,CASTLE>那个亿万富翁兼实业家卡尔·谢尔顿
<15-1,CASTLE>As in billionaire industrialist Carl Shelton?

402
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,460
<15-2,RYAN>是的  而且他很讨厌洛佩兹
<15-2,RYAN>Yeah, and he's no fan of Lopez.

403
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,420
<15-2,RYAN>我看到了谢尔顿当面告诉洛佩兹
<15-2,RYAN>I saw Shelton tell Lopez to his face

404
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,770
<15-2,RYAN>他绝对当不上总统
<15-2,RYAN>that he would never become president.

405
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:22,170
<15-3,CASTLE>也许谢尔顿是想确保这点
<15-3,CASTLE>Maybe Shelton wanted to make sure,

406
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:24,010
<15-3,CASTLE>所以就串通了钱伯斯
<15-3,CASTLE>so he colluded with Chambers.

407
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:25,110
<15-4,ESPOSITO>很有可能
<15-4,ESPOSITO>It's starting to look that way,

408
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:27,500
<15-4,ESPOSITO>尤其是谢尔顿还是酒店的共有人
<15-4,ESPOSITO>especially since Shelton is co-owner of this hotel.

409
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,930
<15-5,BECKETT>也就是说他能弄到一张记者证
<15-5,BECKETT>Which means he would have access to a press pass

410
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:32,120
<15-5,BECKETT>而且也知道怎么带枪过安检
<15-5,BECKETT>and know how to get a gun past security.

411
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:35,200
<15-6,CASTLE>金钱与权利的对抗  企业大亨与政治家之战
<15-6,CASTLE>It's money versus power, tycoon versus politician --

412
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,020
<15-6,CASTLE>从美国建国就开始有这种事了
<15-6,CASTLE>a story as old as America itself.

413
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,140
<15-7,BECKETT>那我们就试着查查艾里克·钱伯斯
<15-7,BECKETT>All right, let's try and find out what the connection is

414
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:41,300
<15-7,BECKETT>和卡尔·谢尔顿的联系吧
<15-7,BECKETT>between Eric Chambers and Carl Shelton.

415
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:43,860
<16-1,LAWYER>我想谢尔顿先生恐怕不认识
<16-1,LAWYER>I'm afraid Mr. Shelton does not know anyone

416
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,090
<16-2,BECKETT>-什么艾里克·钱伯斯  -我们有目击者
<16-2,BECKETT>- named eric chambers. - Well, we have a witness

417
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:48,220
<16-2,BECKETT>看到你们两人在交谈
<16-2,BECKETT>that saw the two of you talking to each other.

418
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,970
<16-3,LAWYER>是目击者看错了
<16-3,LAWYER>That witness is mistaken.

419
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:51,920
<16-1,LAWYER>谢尔顿先生
<16-1,LAWYER>Mr. Shelton,

420
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:55,580
<16-4,BECKETT>你在资助一个叫做美国至上的组织
<16-4,BECKETT>you financed a group called America for Americans.

421
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:58,090
<16-4,BECKETT>它的创始人之一就是艾里克·钱伯斯
<16-4,BECKETT>It's co-founded by Eric Chambers.

422
00:19:58,090 --> 00:19:59,240
<16-5,LAWYER>-我的委托人  -我
<16-5,LAWYER>- My client -- - I...

423
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:02,450
<16-6,CARL SHELTON>我资助了很多草根组织
<16-6,CARL SHELTON>I fund many grassroots organizations

424
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:05,070
<16-6,CARL SHELTON>但凡和我一样关心这个
<16-6,CARL SHELTON>who share my concern about the decline

425
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:07,830
<16-6,CARL SHELTON>伟大国家前程的组织我都资助  但我并不
<16-6,CARL SHELTON>of this great nation, but I'm not acquainted

426
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:10,340
<16-6,CARL SHELTON>认识每个组织的每个人
<16-6,CARL SHELTON>with every person in every group.

427
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:12,960
<16-7,BECKETT>艾里克·钱伯斯恐怕很难忽视吧
<16-7,BECKETT>Eric Chambers' views are hard to miss.

428
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,590
<16-7,BECKETT>他倡议居民武装起来
<16-7,BECKETT>He advocates armed resistance

429
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:17,390
<16-7,BECKETT>反抗他所谓的美国极权主义
<16-7,BECKETT>against what he calls "The U.S. police state."

430
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:19,150
<16-8,SHELTON>我认为美国公民武装起来
<16-8,SHELTON>Well, there's nothing wrong with ordinary Americans

431
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:22,070
<16-8,SHELTON>反抗政府的过度管控没什么错
<16-8,SHELTON>defending themselves against government overreach.

432
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:23,630
<16-9,CASTLE>但这事并非过度管控
<16-9,CASTLE>Well, this isn't about overreach,

433
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:25,270
<16-9,CASTLE>而是你个人想要消灭一个
<16-9,CASTLE>This is about you getting rid of a politician

434
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:26,500
<16-9,CASTLE>意见不合的政敌
<16-9,CASTLE>who stood against you.

435
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,780
<16-10,SHELTON>你在说什么  卡塞尔先生
<16-10,SHELTON>W-what is that, Mr. Castle?

436
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,790
<16-10,SHELTON>你新写的小说吗
<16-10,SHELTON>Your latest work of fiction?

437
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,330
<16-11,LAWYER>我想面谈该结束了吧
<16-11,LAWYER>I believe that concludes our interview.

438
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,990
<16-11,LAWYER>如果你还有问题  请带传票来
<16-11,LAWYER>If you have more questions, get a subpoena.

439
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,960
<16-12,BECKETT>谢尔顿先生  这事是你指使钱伯斯干的
<16-12,BECKETT>Mr. Shelton, you put Chambers up to this

440
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:41,370
<16-12,BECKETT>而我会证明这点
<16-12,BECKETT>and I intend to prove it.

441
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,030
<16-13,SHELTON>祝你好运了
<16-13,SHELTON>Good luck with that.

442
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:58,540
<17-1,ESPOSITO>怎么了  哥们儿
<17-1,ESPOSITO>What's up, bro?

443
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,640
<17-1,ESPOSITO>大家都走了  你怎么还在这儿
<17-1,ESPOSITO>Everyone's gone. What you still doing here?

444
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:03,850
<17-2,RYAN>思考
<17-2,RYAN>Thinking.

445
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:08,400
<17-3,ESPOSITO>好啦  我们破案了  凶手都抓住了
<17-3,ESPOSITO>Come on. This is a win. We got the shooter.

446
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:09,790
<17-4,RYAN>谢尔顿呢
<17-4,RYAN>What about Shelton?

447
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,860
<17-5,ESPOSITO>我们会起诉他的
<17-5,ESPOSITO>We'll build a case against him.

448
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:15,020
<17-5,ESPOSITO>我打赌钱伯斯会帮忙  供出谢尔顿的
<17-5,ESPOSITO>And I bet that Chambers will help us out and roll on Shelton.

449
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,310
<17-6,RYAN>那他为什么还没供出他呢
<17-6,RYAN>Why hasn't he done that already?

450
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:20,030
<17-7,ESPOSITO>也许谢尔顿许诺了钱伯斯
<17-7,ESPOSITO>Maybe Shelton made Chambers some promises

451
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,470
<17-7,ESPOSITO>某种好处作为封口费
<17-7,ESPOSITO>in return for him keeping his mouth shut.

452
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,950
<17-8,RYAN>谢尔顿这样地位的人为什么要冒险
<17-8,RYAN>Why would a man in Shelton's situation

453
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,500
<17-8,RYAN>被人看见和钱伯斯在一起呢
<17-8,RYAN>risk being seen with Chambers?

454
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,340
<17-9,ESPOSITO>因为他和其他那些富有的混蛋一样
<17-9,ESPOSITO>Because he's like all these other rich sons of bitches

455
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,930
<17-9,ESPOSITO>以为钱能摆平一切麻烦
<17-9,ESPOSITO>who think they can get away with anything.

456
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,350
<17-10,RYAN>我不知道  这事有点不对劲  哈维
<17-10,RYAN>I don't know. Something about this just isn't sitting right, Javi.

457
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,030
<17-11,ESPOSITO>你现在思维不清楚
<17-11,ESPOSITO>You're spinning.

458
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:38,000
<17-11,ESPOSITO>你只需要好好睡上一晚
<17-11,ESPOSITO>You just need a good night's sleep.

459
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:40,550
<17-11,ESPOSITO>明早一切就都清楚了
<17-11,ESPOSITO>In the morning, everything will be clear to you.

460
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:41,480
<17-11,ESPOSITO>好吗
<17-11,ESPOSITO>All right?

461
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:55,550
<18-1,BECKETT>喂
<18-1,BECKETT>Hello.

462
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:00,100
<18-2,BECKETT>什么
<18-2,BECKETT>What?!

463
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,220
<18-2,BECKETT>好的  现在怎么样
<18-2,BECKETT>Right. How about now?

464
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,300
<19-1,RYAN>-看起来不错  -好
<19-1,RYAN>- That looks good. - Okay.

465
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,490
<19-2,CASTLE>太好了  你来了
<19-2,CASTLE>Oh! Good, you're here.

466
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:09,220
<19-3,BECKETT>这是什么  你们在干什么
<19-3,BECKETT>What is this? What are you guys doing?

467
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:13,160
<19-4,CASTLE>莱恩在这忙了一整晚  他发短信叫我来
<19-4,CASTLE>Ah, well, Ryan was working all night, and he texted me.

468
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:14,930
<19-5,BECKETT>你叫卡塞尔却不叫我
<19-5,BECKETT>You texted Castle and not me?

469
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:16,680
<19-6,RYAN>想出疯狂的推理时
<19-6,RYAN>Well, when you have a crazy theory,

470
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,990
<19-6,RYAN>你是不会叫理智的人来的
<19-6,RYAN>you don't call the voice of reason.

471
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,360
<19-7,BECKETT>什么  什么推理
<19-7,BECKETT>What -- what theory?

472
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,900
<19-8,CASTLE>艾里克·钱伯斯不是开枪的人
<19-8,CASTLE>Eric Chambers is not our shooter.

473
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:21,950
<19-8,CASTLE>我们抓错人了
<19-8,CASTLE>We got the wrong guy.

474
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:29,500
<20-1,GATES>你说艾里克·钱伯斯不是开枪的人吗
<20-1,GATES>You're telling me Eric Chambers is not our shooter?

475
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:30,770
<20-1,GATES>有什么根据
<20-1,GATES>Based on what?

476
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:31,920
<20-2,RYAN>物理学  长官
<20-2,RYAN>Physics, sir.

477
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:33,060
<20-3,BECKETT>洛佩兹议员说
<20-3,BECKETT>Congressman Lopez said

478
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,940
<20-3,BECKETT>他跟卡洛琳·戴克说话的时候
<20-3,BECKETT>that when he talked to Carolyn Decker,

479
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,900
<20-3,BECKETT>他看见钱伯斯站在远处的墙边
<20-3,BECKETT>he saw Chambers by the far wall.

480
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,030
<20-4,RYAN>鉴证组也的确在那里找到了他的指纹
<20-4,RYAN>Which is where CSU found his prints.

481
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:41,600
<20-5,CASTLE>但几秒钟后  刺客就开枪了
<20-5,CASTLE>But seconds later, our assassin opens fire --

482
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:42,510
<20-5,CASTLE>连开三枪
<20-5,CASTLE>three shots.

483
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:45,090
<20-6,RYAN>第一枪打在洛佩兹左面锁骨的下方
<20-6,RYAN>The first one strikes Lopez beneath the left clavicle.

484
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:47,510
<20-7,BECKETT>第二枪擦过卡洛琳·戴克的肩膀
<20-7,BECKETT>The second one grazes Carolyn Decker's shoulder,

485
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:49,770
<20-7,BECKETT>第三枪打在她后背偏下的位置
<20-7,BECKETT>and the third one strikes her in the upper back.

486
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:51,760
<20-8,RYAN>那一枪击中了她的肺动脉
<20-8,RYAN>That shot severs her pulmonary artery.

487
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,860
<20-8,RYAN>连抢救的机会都没有
<20-8,RYAN>She never has a chance.

488
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,540
<20-9,GATES>这些怎么会让你们认为
<20-9,GATES>How does any of this lead you to think

489
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,500
<20-9,GATES>钱伯斯不是那个刺客呢
<20-9,GATES>that Chambers is not the assassin.

490
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,830
<20-10,CASTLE>钱伯斯的有利位置
<20-10,CASTLE>Chambers' vantage point.

491
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:01,170
<20-10,CASTLE>他是从侧面看洛佩兹和卡洛琳·戴克的
<20-10,CASTLE>He had a side-angle view of Lopez and Carolyn Decker.

492
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:03,720
<20-11,RYAN>所以钱伯斯怎么可能从背后击中卡洛琳呢
<20-11,RYAN>So how did Chambers manage to shoot Carolyn in the back?

493
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,660
<20-11,RYAN>答案是他不可能做到
<20-11,RYAN>The answer is that he couldn't have,

494
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,370
<20-11,RYAN>除非那个子弹神奇的
<20-11,RYAN>not unless that bullet magically took

495
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:08,890
<20-11,RYAN>在空中向右转了个弯
<20-11,RYAN>a hard right turn in midair.

496
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:12,000
<20-12,CASTLE>所以说开枪的人是从草丘那里开的枪
<20-12,CASTLE>Which means the shots were fired from the grassy knoll,

497
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,970
<20-12,CASTLE>-比喻说法  -贝克特探长
<20-12,CASTLE>- metaphorically speaking. - Detective Beckett,

498
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:16,250
<20-13,GATES>你真的认为他们的话可信吗
<20-13,GATES>do you actually find any of this plausible?

499
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,470
<20-14,BECKETT>是的  长官  可信到
<20-14,BECKETT>Yes, sir, plausible enough that I'm getting ballistics

500
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:21,300
<20-14,BECKETT>我让弹道分析人员回去重新做分析
<20-14,BECKETT>to reevaluate the crime scene.

501
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:23,940
<20-15,GATES>钱伯斯有动机
<20-15,GATES>Chambers had motive,

502
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,160
<20-15,GATES>他偷了张记者证  案发后他逃跑了
<20-15,GATES>he stole a press pass, he fled the shooting.

503
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:29,120
<20-15,GATES>-这些你怎么解释  -我想钱伯斯被陷害
<20-15,GATES>- How do you explain all that? - I think Chambers

504
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:31,770
<20-16,RYAN>-做替罪羊  -可能是被卡尔·谢尔顿陷害的
<20-16,RYAN>- was set up to be the fall guy. - Probably by Carl Shelton.

505
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:34,830
<20-18,GATES>那他为什么不坚称自己是清白的呢
<20-18,GATES>Then why isn't he vigorously protesting his innocence?

506
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,520
<20-19,CASTLE>钱伯斯不信任政府
<20-19,CASTLE>Chambers distrusts authority.

507
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,560
<20-20,BECKETT>而他认为我们也是陷害他的人
<20-20,BECKETT>And he believes that we're part of a plot against him.

508
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,550
<20-21,GATES>无论如何  艾里克·钱伯斯依然是第一嫌疑人
<20-21,GATES>Nonetheless, Eric Chambers remains our prime suspect

509
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:43,260
<20-21,GATES>除非有证据表明他无罪
<20-21,GATES>unless proof comes in that he isn't.

510
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,440
<20-22,RYAN>在此期间  长官
<20-22,RYAN>In the meantime, sir,

511
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,400
<20-22,RYAN>我想再审问他一次
<20-22,RYAN>I'd like to take another run at him.

512
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,640
<21-1,CHAMBERS>你是在浪费时间
<21-1,CHAMBERS>You're wasting your time.

513
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:54,950
<21-1,CHAMBERS>我不会开口的
<21-1,CHAMBERS>I'm not talking.

514
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,350
<21-2,RYAN>没关系
<21-2,RYAN>Well, that's okay.

515
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:03,480
<21-2,RYAN>你不用开口  你听着就行
<21-2,RYAN>You don't have to talk. You can just listen.

516
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,740
<21-3,RYAN>是的  我们知道...  你不是开枪的人
<21-3,RYAN>Yeah, we know that... you're not the shooter.

517
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:10,970
<21-4,CHAMBERS>你当然知道
<21-4,CHAMBERS>Of course you do.

518
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:13,090
<21-4,CHAMBERS>是你们的人精心策划了整件事
<21-4,CHAMBERS>You people orchestrated the whole thing.

519
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,080
<21-5,RYAN>我告诉你吧  艾里克
<21-5,RYAN>You know, Eric, I got a news flash for you.

520
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:18,590
<21-5,RYAN>你并不是某个大型政府阴谋组织的目标
<21-5,RYAN>You're not the focus of some big governmental conspiracy.

521
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:21,630
<21-5,RYAN>没人对你有一丁点的兴趣
<21-5,RYAN>No one has the... least bit of interest in you.

522
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,280
<21-5,RYAN>说实话  我收回那句话
<21-5,RYAN>Actually, I take that back.

523
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:30,390
<21-5,RYAN>有人对你很感兴趣
<21-5,RYAN>Someone is very interested in you --

524
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,550
<21-5,RYAN>那个陷害你的人
<21-5,RYAN>whoever set you up.

525
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,740
<21-5,RYAN>有人
<21-5,RYAN>Somebody went to

526
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:40,070
<21-5,RYAN>费尽心思陷害你
<21-5,RYAN>a significant amount of trouble to frame you,

527
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:40,920
<21-5,RYAN>而现在...
<21-5,RYAN>and now...

528
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:47,080
<21-5,RYAN>现在你知道的太多了
<21-5,RYAN>...now you know too much.

529
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:50,670
<21-5,RYAN>成了需要清理的目标
<21-5,RYAN>You're a loose end.

530
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:54,680
<21-5,RYAN>你可不会有什么好下场
<21-5,RYAN>I don't see a very bright future for you.

531
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:03,910
<21-6,CHAMBERS>你真的指望我会相信你说的话吗
<21-6,CHAMBERS>You honestly expect me to believe a word you say?

532
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:06,300
<21-7,RYAN>那取决于你  这是你的生活
<21-7,RYAN>Eh, that's up to you. It's your life.

533
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:11,940
<21-7,RYAN>只要告诉我你怎么进入后台的
<21-7,RYAN>Just tell me everything about how you got backstage,

534
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,130
<21-7,RYAN>我会保证你的安全
<21-7,RYAN>and I'll keep you safe.

535
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:17,580
<21-7,RYAN>如果不说  我就帮不了你了
<21-7,RYAN>If not, I can't help you.

536
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,070
<21-7,RYAN>没人能帮你
<21-7,RYAN>Nobody can.

537
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,350
<21-8,RYAN>你想想吧
<21-8,RYAN>Just think about it.

538
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,400
<21-8,RYAN>不过别想太久了
<21-8,RYAN>But don't think too long.

539
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:34,790
<21-9,CHAMBERS>等等
<21-9,CHAMBERS>Wait.

540
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:40,420
<22-1,BECKETT>如果钱伯斯不是开枪的人
<22-1,BECKETT>So, if Chambers isn't our shooter,

541
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:42,130
<22-1,BECKETT>那他去后台干什么
<22-1,BECKETT>then what was he doing backstage?

542
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:45,100
<22-2,RYAN>他想在洛佩兹电视演讲时与他对质
<22-2,RYAN>He wanted to make a political statement by confronting Lopez

543
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,080
<22-2,RYAN>表达自己的政治立场
<22-2,RYAN>during his speech in front of the cameras.

544
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,530
<22-2,RYAN>这样的话  他知道这会在
<22-2,RYAN>That way, he knew that it would blow up

545
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:50,240
<22-2,RYAN>24小时滚动新闻中播放
<22-2,RYAN>on the 24-hour news cycle.

546
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,570
<22-3,CASTLE>那卡尔·谢尔顿怎么回事
<22-3,CASTLE>All right, what about Carl Shelton?

547
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:53,980
<22-4,RYAN>卡塞尔  看起来这跟谢尔顿无关
<22-4,RYAN>Castle, it's looking like Shelton may not be involved.

548
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,580
<22-4,RYAN>这个亿万富翁实业家
<22-4,RYAN>The billionaire industrialist

549
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:57,290
<22-5,CASTLE>手握权力的杠杆
<22-5,CASTLE>with his grubby hands on the levers of power?

550
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:58,570
<22-5,CASTLE>当然和他有关
<22-5,CASTLE>Of course he's involved.

551
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:00,190
<22-5,CASTLE>有人看到他们一起出现在储藏室
<22-5,CASTLE>They were seen in the storage room.

552
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:01,180
<22-6,RYAN>那是因为谢尔顿
<22-6,RYAN>That's because Shelton

553
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:03,190
<22-6,RYAN>意识到钱伯斯想搞砸那次活动
<22-6,RYAN>realized that Chambers had crashed the event.

554
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:05,170
<22-6,RYAN>所以他想劝服他不要闹事
<22-6,RYAN>So, he tried to talk him out of making a scene.

555
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:07,600
<22-7,BECKETT>钱伯斯到底从哪里弄到的记者证
<22-7,BECKETT>So, where did Chambers get the press pass from?

556
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,370
<22-8,RYAN>放这他的信箱里
<22-8,RYAN>It was left for him in his mailbox.

557
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:10,480
<22-9,CASTLE>他的信箱里吗
<22-9,CASTLE>In his mailbox?

558
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,160
<22-10,RYAN>-谁放的  -一个匿名的支持者
<22-10,RYAN>- By whom? - An anonymous sympathizer

559
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,960
<22-10,RYAN>通过他的网站联系到他
<22-10,RYAN>contacted him through his website,

560
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,040
<22-10,RYAN>给他留下记者证还有
<22-10,RYAN>left him the pass, and instructions

561
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,340
<22-10,RYAN>如何去后台的指示图
<22-10,RYAN>about where to wait backstage.

562
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:22,180
<22-11,CASTLE>好吧  我能说...
<22-11,CASTLE>Okay, can I -- can I just say...

563
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:25,160
<22-11,CASTLE>我知道我偶尔会
<22-11,CASTLE>I know I have occasionally theorized

564
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,950
<22-11,CASTLE>发表阴谋论
<22-11,CASTLE>that a conspiracy was afoot.

565
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:27,610
<22-12,BECKETT>只是偶尔吗
<22-12,BECKETT>"Occasionally"?

566
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:30,350
<22-13,CASTLE>不过这次  真的是有个阴谋
<22-13,CASTLE>But this time, a conspiracy really is afoot.

567
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:32,320
<22-13,CASTLE>伙计们  钱伯斯明显就是被
<22-13,CASTLE>Guys, Chambers was clearly being manipulated

568
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:35,330
<22-13,CASTLE>身份不明的人操控潜入后台
<22-13,CASTLE>by person or persons unknown into being backstage

569
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:37,030
<22-13,CASTLE>所以他可以成为完美的替罪羊
<22-13,CASTLE>so he'd be the perfect patsy.

570
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:38,900
<22-14,BECKETT>为什么有人会大费周章
<22-14,BECKETT>Why would someone go to all that trouble

571
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,490
<22-14,BECKETT>陷害他是射杀洛佩兹的枪手
<22-14,BECKETT>to set him up as Lopez's shooter?

572
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:43,150
<22-15,ESPOSITO>我也许可以解答这个问题
<22-15,ESPOSITO>I may have an answer for that.

573
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:45,990
<22-15,ESPOSITO>根据初级弹道学的报告  你说得对
<22-15,ESPOSITO>Prelim ballistics report. You were right.

574
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:48,030
<22-15,ESPOSITO>子弹不是从钱伯斯的位置发出的
<22-15,ESPOSITO>The shots did not come from where Chambers was standing.

575
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,350
<22-16,CASTLE>-那是从哪儿射出的  -根据轨迹
<22-16,CASTLE>- So where did the shots come from? - Well, based on trajectories,

576
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:52,360
<22-17,ESPOSITO>子弹是从这个位置发射出来的
<22-17,ESPOSITO>the shots were fired from this position right here.

577
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,680
<22-18,RYAN>枪手站在照明支柱的后面
<22-18,RYAN>The shooter was behind the lighting stanchion.

578
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,290
<22-19,BECKETT>这就是为什么没人看见他
<22-19,BECKETT>That's why no one saw him.

579
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:58,390
<22-19,BECKETT>开枪后他就从后面溜走了
<22-19,BECKETT>He took a shot and then he slipped out the back.

580
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,900
<22-20,ESPOSITO>那个地方的确很隐蔽
<22-20,ESPOSITO>Yeah, it's good concealment.

581
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,130
<22-20,ESPOSITO>不会有人看见他
<22-20,ESPOSITO>Nobody would be able to spot him,

582
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:02,520
<22-20,ESPOSITO>但从这个角度看
<22-20,ESPOSITO>but check out this angle.

583
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:06,120
<22-21,CASTLE>卡洛琳·戴克把洛佩兹挡住了
<22-21,CASTLE>Carolyn Decker's blocking Lopez.

584
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,560
<22-22,RYAN>这就能解释为什么刺客没有射中洛佩兹
<22-22,RYAN>That would explain why the assassin missed Lopez.

585
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:10,290
<22-23,BECKETT>除非他没有射偏
<22-23,BECKETT>Unless he didn't miss him.

586
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:13,510
<22-24,ESPOSITO>的确  卡洛琳·戴克几乎正对着枪手
<22-24,ESPOSITO>Exactly, Carolyn Decker was almost square to the shooter

587
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:14,680
<22-24,ESPOSITO>并且她也是被射击到中心位置
<22-24,ESPOSITO>and she's the one who got hit center-mass.

588
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:18,640
<22-25,BECKETT>各位  万一我们查错了方向怎么办
<22-25,BECKETT>You guys, what if we're looking at this the wrong way?

589
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,110
<22-26,CASTLE>卡洛琳·戴克才是真正的目标
<22-26,CASTLE>And Carolyn Decker's the real target.

590
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:21,570
<22-27,RYAN>我们会彻查她的一切
<22-27,RYAN>All right, we'll dig through her life.

591
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:23,060
<22-27,RYAN>看是否什么人有杀人动机
<22-27,RYAN>See if anyone had motive to do this.

592
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,890
<22-28,TORY>你们得先看一下这个
<22-28,TORY>There's something you should see first.

593
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:29,210
<23-1,TORY>这是来自艾里克·钱伯斯的住处
<23-1,TORY>This is from Eric Chambers' building.

594
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:31,310
<23-1,TORY>我在核查  把他的时间线连在一起时
<23-1,TORY>I was reviewing it to paste together his timeline

595
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,460
<23-1,TORY>看到了这个
<23-1,TORY>when I saw this.

596
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,960
<23-1,TORY>他径直走到钱伯斯的邮箱
<23-1,TORY>He goes straight to Chambers' mailbox.

597
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:37,950
<23-2,CASTLE>这肯定不是邮递员
<23-2,CASTLE>Okay, that is definitely not the mailman.

598
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:39,650
<23-3,BECKETT>他肯定是把记者证给钱伯斯
<23-3,BECKETT>He must be leaving the press pass for Chambers.

599
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:40,250
<23-3,BECKETT>这是什么时候
<23-3,BECKETT>When was this?

600
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:41,810
<23-4,TORY>枪击前三小时
<23-4,TORY>Three hours before the shooting.

601
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:43,430
<23-5,ESPOSITO>我们能看一下这个人的脸吗
<23-5,ESPOSITO>Can we get a look at this dude's face?

602
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,570
<23-6,TORY>不是很清楚
<23-6,TORY>Not a good one.

603
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:51,370
<23-7,RYAN>天哪
<23-7,RYAN>Oh, my god.

604
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:53,750
<23-8,BECKETT>怎么了
<23-8,BECKETT>What is it?

605
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:58,150
<23-9,RYAN>是我的姐夫  弗兰克
<23-9,RYAN>That's my brother-in-law. That's Frank.

606
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:04,610
<24-1,GATES>你确定那是弗兰克·凯利
<24-1,GATES>Are you sure that's Frank Kelly?

607
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,920
<24-2,RYAN>毫无疑问
<24-2,RYAN>Yeah. No question.

608
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:11,030
<24-3,BECKETT>莱恩  我知道这很难接受  但是
<24-3,BECKETT>Ryan, I know this is hard, but...

609
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:14,590
<24-3,BECKETT>枪击发生时弗兰克在哪
<24-3,BECKETT>Where was Frank during those shots?

610
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,320
<24-4,FRANK>好的  我会在台上看着他
<24-4,FRANK>All right, I'll keep eyes on him onstage.

611
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,780
<24-4,FRANK>这就交给你了
<24-4,FRANK>You cover him back here?

612
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:21,200
<24-4,FRANK>他在帷幕的另一边
<24-4,FRANK>He was on the other side of the curtain.

613
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,830
<25-1,RYAN>他去了宴会厅来掩护洛佩兹
<25-1,RYAN>He went into the ballroom to cover Lopez.

614
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:25,230
<25-2,CASTLE>你看到他在那了吗
<25-2,CASTLE>Did you see him out there?

615
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:27,360
<3-36,RYAN>没有
<3-36,RYAN>No.

616
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:30,490
<25-3,RYAN>所以你也不是很清楚他在哪里
<25-3,RYAN>So, you don't really know where he was.

617
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:33,180
<25-4,GATES>枪击后  他多久到的
<25-4,GATES>After the shots, how soon did he arrive?

618
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,800
<25-5,RYAN>十秒钟  可能
<25-5,RYAN>10 seconds, maybe.

619
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:39,070
<25-6,BECKETT>足够他从
<25-6,BECKETT>Long enough for him to get

620
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:41,350
<25-6,BECKETT>照明支柱到你可以看到他的地方
<25-6,BECKETT>from the light stanchion to where you saw him.

621
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:44,280
<25-7,RYAN>所以  你是说
<25-7,RYAN>So, what are you saying here,

622
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:47,890
<25-7,RYAN>是弗兰克杀害了卡洛琳·戴克吗
<25-7,RYAN>that Frank killed Carolyn Decker?

623
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:48,900
<25-7,RYAN>他为什么要那样做
<25-7,RYAN>Why would he?

624
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:49,980
<25-8,GATES>我不知道
<25-8,GATES>I don't know,

625
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:51,940
<25-8,GATES>但我们必须考虑这个可能性
<25-8,GATES>but we need to consider the possibility.

626
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,770
<25-8,GATES>至少  他参与其中
<25-8,GATES>At the very least, he was involved,

627
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:56,020
<25-8,GATES>所以我们要把他带来
<25-8,GATES>so we're bringing him in.

628
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:58,710
<25-9,RYAN>很好  因为你知道吗
<25-9,RYAN>Good. Because you know what?

629
00:28:58,860 --> 00:28:59,980
<25-9,RYAN>他会告诉我们他的说辞
<25-9,RYAN>He'll tell his side of the story.

630
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,280
<25-9,RYAN>肯定会对此有所解释的
<25-9,RYAN>There's an explanation for this.

631
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,780
<25-10,CASTLE>肯定会有的  莱恩
<25-10,CASTLE>I-I'm sure there is, Ryan.

632
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,280
<25-10,CASTLE>没有什么会比这更让我们欣慰的
<25-10,CASTLE>A-and nothing would make us happier.

633
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,680
<25-11,RYAN>伙计们  这是我的姐夫
<25-11,RYAN>Guys, this is my brother-in-law.

634
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:08,590
<25-11,RYAN>他肯定不会卷入到像这样的事里
<25-11,RYAN>There's no way he can be mixed up in something like this.

635
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,710
<25-11,RYAN>哥们
<25-11,RYAN>Hey, bro.

636
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,060
<25-12,ESPOSITO>很遗憾
<25-12,ESPOSITO>I'm sorry to say that

637
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,840
<25-12,ESPOSITO>警员刚准备把弗兰克带过来
<25-12,ESPOSITO>UNIs just tried to pick up Frank.

638
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:16,440
<25-12,ESPOSITO>他一看到警车就跑了
<25-12,ESPOSITO>As soon as he saw the patrol car, he bolted.

639
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:17,790
<25-12,ESPOSITO>他们没追到他
<25-12,ESPOSITO>They lost him.

640
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:20,600
<25-13,GATES>发出全境通缉
<25-13,GATES>Issue an A.P.B. see if there's any connection

641
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,870
<25-13,GATES>看弗兰克·凯利和卡洛琳·戴克是否有关联
<25-13,GATES>between Frank Kelly and Carolyn Decker.

642
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,450
<25-14,BECKETT>我去查
<25-14,BECKETT>I'm on it.

643
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,100
<25-15,GATES>你要去哪里
<25-15,GATES>Uh, where are you going?

644
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:29,970
<25-16,RYAN>我要去找到弗兰克
<25-16,RYAN>I'm gonna go find Frank.

645
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,410
<25-17,ESPOSITO>我和你一起去
<25-17,ESPOSITO>I'll go with you.

646
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:38,180
<25-18,RYAN>谢谢  哈维  但这是我的家人
<25-18,RYAN>Thanks, Javi, but... this is family here.

647
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:39,450
<25-18,RYAN>我想一个人去
<25-18,RYAN>I got to do this one alone.

648
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:42,580
<25-18,RYAN>好的
<25-18,RYAN>Okay.

649
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:51,720
<26-1,RYAN>我得和弗兰克谈谈  格温
<26-1,RYAN>I need to talk to Frank, Gwen.

650
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:52,900
<26-2,GWEN KELLY>他不在这
<26-2,GWEN KELLY>He's not here.

651
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:53,920
<26-3,RYAN>那他在哪
<26-3,RYAN>Where is he, then?

652
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:56,580
<26-4,GWEN>凯文  你难道一走进来
<26-4,GWEN>Kevin, don't you walk in here

653
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:58,450
<26-4,GWEN>就开始指责你自己的家人吗
<26-4,GWEN>and start pointing fingers at our own family.

654
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:00,360
<26-5,RYAN>他跑了  他为什么要那样做  格温
<26-5,RYAN>He ran! Why would he do that, Gwen?!

655
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:03,000
<26-6,RYAN>他做了什么
<26-6,RYAN>What's he into?

656
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:03,890
<26-7,GWEN>什么都没有
<26-7,GWEN>Nothing!

657
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:08,030
<26-8,RYAN>我知道这个表情
<26-8,RYAN>I know that look.

658
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:10,980
<26-8,RYAN>那是你以前
<26-8,RYAN>Yeah, that's the look that you used to get

659
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,050
<26-8,RYAN>偷偷抽烟
<26-8,RYAN>when you'd sneak a cigarette

660
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:13,590
<26-8,RYAN>跟妈妈撒谎的表情
<26-8,RYAN>and then you'd lie to mom about it.

661
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:16,070
<26-8,RYAN>格温我支持你  但我得知道真相
<26-8,RYAN>Look, Gwen, I'm here for you, but I need to know the truth.

662
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,680
<26-8,RYAN>他干了什么
<26-8,RYAN>What's he into?

663
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:25,000
<26-9,GWEN>去年家里的情况很紧张
<26-9,GWEN>Things were tight last year.

664
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:28,800
<26-9,GWEN>你知道  孩子们都在圣玛格丽特上学
<26-9,GWEN>You know, both kids are at St. Margaret's now,

665
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,600
<26-9,GWEN>费用很高
<26-9,GWEN>and that costs an arm and a leg.

666
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:33,440
<26-9,GWEN>可那之后家里慢慢有了一些钱
<26-9,GWEN>But then some money started coming in.

667
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,080
<26-10,RYAN>从哪来的钱
<26-10,RYAN>From where?

668
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:38,320
<26-11,GWEN>弗兰克说他在做些额外的工作
<26-11,GWEN>Frank said that he was picking up extra work, and...

669
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:40,540
<26-11,GWEN>但他并不是在公司挣的
<26-11,GWEN>But he never ran it through the company.

670
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:42,000
<26-11,GWEN>总是拿的现金
<26-11,GWEN>It was always cash.

671
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:43,140
<26-12,RYAN>有多少
<26-12,RYAN>How much cash?

672
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:46,340
<26-13,GWEN>加起来大概五万美金
<26-13,GWEN>Over time... close to 50 grand.

673
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:49,220
<26-13,GWEN>凯文  你是知道弗兰克的
<26-13,GWEN>Kevin! You know Frank.

674
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:51,290
<26-13,GWEN>你知道他是不会伤害别人的
<26-13,GWEN>You know he would never hurt a soul.

675
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:53,680
<26-14,RYAN>那就告诉我他在哪  不然他会受到伤害
<26-14,RYAN>Then tell me where he is before he's the one who gets hurt.

676
00:30:59,010 --> 00:30:59,960
<27-1,CASTLE>有莱恩的消息吗
<27-1,CASTLE>Any word from Ryan?

677
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:03,210
<27-2,BECKETT>没有  还没  这肯定很艰难
<27-2,BECKETT>Uh, no. Not yet. It's got to be tough.

678
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,250
<27-2,BECKETT>弗兰克对他来说就像亲兄弟一样
<27-2,BECKETT>Frank is like a brother to him.

679
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:09,090
<27-3,CASTLE>也许弗兰克不像我们想的那样陷得这么深
<27-3,CASTLE>Well, maybe Frank isn't in this as deep as we think.

680
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,600
<27-3,CASTLE>埃斯波西托还没有找到
<27-3,CASTLE>Esposito still hasn't found

681
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,760
<27-3,CASTLE>他和卡洛琳·戴克之间的任何关联
<27-3,CASTLE>anything connecting him to Carolyn Decker.

682
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,250
<27-4,BECKETT>我也没有
<27-4,BECKETT>Yeah, well, neither have I.

683
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,190
<27-4,BECKETT>最讨厌这差事
<27-4,BECKETT>I hate this part.

684
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:18,690
<27-5,CASTLE>检查受害者的个人物品吗
<27-5,CASTLE>Going through a victim's effects?

685
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:20,360
<27-6,BECKETT>是啊  尤其是手包
<27-6,BECKETT>Yeah, especially a purse.

686
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,830
<27-6,BECKETT>里面每一件东西都太私密
<27-6,BECKETT>Everything in it is just so intimate.

687
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:26,910
<27-6,BECKETT>让你有机会看到一个人的
<27-6,BECKETT>It's like you get a chance to really see

688
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:28,190
<27-6,BECKETT>真面目
<27-6,BECKETT>who a person is...

689
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:31,190
<27-6,BECKETT>或曾经的真面目
<27-6,BECKETT>or was.

690
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:33,980
<27-7,CASTLE>那卡洛琳·戴克的真面目如何
<27-7,CASTLE>And who was Carolyn Decker?

691
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:39,470
<27-8,BECKETT>她是...她是一个工作狂
<27-8,BECKETT>Uh, she was, um... a workaholic.

692
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:42,910
<27-8,BECKETT>手机上的日常闹钟设置为早上四点
<27-8,BECKETT>The daily alarm on her phone is set for 4:00 a.m.

693
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:43,960
<27-8,BECKETT>从她的日程表上看
<27-8,BECKETT>And her calendar shows

694
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,820
<27-8,BECKETT>她全身心地投入了净水计划
<27-8,BECKETT>that she was completely dedicated to pure water now.

695
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:50,450
<27-8,BECKETT>在她的钱包里有一封来自非洲小男孩
<27-8,BECKETT>She has that handwritten letter from a little boy in Africa

696
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:52,330
<27-8,BECKETT>亲笔写的感谢信
<27-8,BECKETT>in her wallet thanking her.

697
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:55,800
<27-8,BECKETT>他的村子由于霍乱几乎灭绝
<27-8,BECKETT>His village was almost completely wiped out by cholera.

698
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,110
<27-8,BECKETT>然后他们在村子里建起了净水系统
<27-8,BECKETT>And then once they set up the water-filtration system

699
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:59,720
<27-8,BECKETT>再也没人死了
<27-8,BECKETT>in the village, nobody died.

700
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:03,000
<27-8,BECKETT>她的确是有所作为
<27-8,BECKETT>She was actually making a difference.

701
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,720
<27-9,CASTLE>你也有所作为
<27-9,CASTLE>You know, you make a difference, too.

702
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,010
<27-10,BECKETT>但不如她
<27-10,BECKETT>Yeah, not like her.

703
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:12,420
<27-11,CASTLE>好吧
<27-11,CASTLE>Okay.

704
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:13,770
<27-11,CASTLE>怎么了
<27-11,CASTLE>What?

705
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:17,860
<27-12,BECKETT>她还有一部手机
<27-12,BECKETT>She's got a second phone.

706
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,090
<27-13,CASTLE>里面有什么吗
<27-13,CASTLE>Anything on it?

707
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:23,190
<27-14,BECKETT>对  谋杀动机
<27-14,BECKETT>Yeah. Motive for murder.

708
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:48,520
<28-1,RYAN>你做了什么  弗兰克
<28-1,RYAN>What did you do, Frank?

709
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:51,920
<28-2,FRANK>跟你想的不一样
<28-2,FRANK>Not what you're thinking, man.

710
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:53,300
<28-3,RYAN>装得不错
<28-3,RYAN>That's a nice touch,

711
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,400
<28-3,RYAN>当我想起钱伯斯带着记者证时
<28-3,RYAN>the way you acted all surprised when I remembered

712
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,460
<28-3,RYAN>你装出一脸吃惊的样子
<28-3,RYAN>that Chambers was wearing a press pass.

713
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:00,400
<28-3,RYAN>其实你一点都不惊讶  弗兰克
<28-3,RYAN>Well, you weren't surprised Frank,

714
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,420
<28-3,RYAN>因为就是你把记者证给他的
<28-3,RYAN>because all along it was you that gave it to him.

715
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:05,660
<28-3,RYAN>你雇我干这趟活
<28-3,RYAN>You hired me for this job

716
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:08,320
<28-3,RYAN>是因为你知道我根本就不会怀疑你
<28-3,RYAN>because you knew that I would never suspect you.

717
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:10,600
<28-3,RYAN>你知道你能引导整个调查
<28-3,RYAN>You knew that you could steer the investigation.

718
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,910
<28-4,FRANK>不不  不是这样的
<28-4,FRANK>No. No, it wasn't like that.

719
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:14,150
<28-4,FRANK>没人会受到伤害的
<28-4,FRANK>And nobody was ever supposed to get hurt.

720
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,670
<28-5,RYAN>这他妈到底什么意思
<28-5,RYAN>What the hell does that even mean?

721
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,440
<28-5,RYAN>卡洛琳·戴克  她死了
<28-5,RYAN>Carolyn Decker, she's dead.

722
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,480
<28-5,RYAN>我深深自责  而一切都是你干的
<28-5,RYAN>I blamed myself. All along it was you.

723
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,940
<28-6,FRANK>凯文  我卷进了一些事
<28-6,FRANK>Kev, I got myself into something

724
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,690
<28-6,FRANK>我无法脱身
<28-6,FRANK>and I-I can't get myself out.

725
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:26,270
<28-6,FRANK>你怎么能这样
<28-6,FRANK>How... how could you do this?

726
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:29,850
<28-7,RYAN>你怎么能这样对待格温和孩子们
<28-7,RYAN>How -- how could you do this to Gwen and the kids?

727
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:33,080
<28-7,RYAN>看着我的眼睛告诉我
<28-7,RYAN>Look me in the eyes and tell me...

728
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:36,020
<28-7,RYAN>你有没有杀卡洛琳
<28-7,RYAN>did you kill Carolyn?

729
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:37,760
<28-7,RYAN>你认识她吗
<28-7,RYAN>Did you know her?

730
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,000
<28-7,RYAN>你杀她是为了钱吗
<28-7,RYAN>Did you do it for the money?

731
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,950
<28-8,FRANK>我没有杀人
<28-8,FRANK>I didn't kill nobody.

732
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,320
<28-9,RYAN>你一定做了什么  弗兰克
<28-9,RYAN>Well, you had to have done something, Frank.

733
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,600
<28-9,RYAN>你哪来的现金
<28-9,RYAN>Where did you get all that cash?

734
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:54,150
<28-10,FRANK>安保的工作
<28-10,FRANK>The security thing...

735
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,850
<28-10,FRANK>并不如我说的那样顺利
<28-10,FRANK>ain't going as good as I said.

736
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:02,520
<28-10,FRANK>生活不易  懂吗  我需要钱
<28-10,FRANK>Times are tough, you know? I needed money.

737
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:07,250
<28-10,FRANK>所以我靠卖通行证赚点外快
<28-10,FRANK>So I made some cash on the side by selling access.

738
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:08,570
<28-11,RYAN>什么样的通行证
<28-11,RYAN>What kind of access?

739
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:11,080
<28-12,FRANK>帮人溜进演唱会后台
<28-12,FRANK>Slipping people in backstage at a concert,

740
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,020
<28-12,FRANK>方便狗仔之类的
<28-12,FRANK>passes to fringe journalists,

741
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,270
<28-12,FRANK>就是那些无法从正门进入的人
<28-12,FRANK>you know, who can't get in the front door.

742
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:16,810
<28-12,FRANK>我向你发誓  我不知道记者证
<28-12,FRANK>I swear to you, I didn't know that press pass

743
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:17,860
<28-12,FRANK>会到钱伯斯的手里
<28-12,FRANK>was going to Chambers.

744
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:20,680
<28-12,FRANK>我只想为我的家庭  你的姐姐提供更好的生活
<28-12,FRANK>I'm just trying to provide for my family, for your sister.

745
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,490
<28-12,FRANK>我以为你会理解我
<28-12,FRANK>I thought, of all people, you'd understand that.

746
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,490
<28-13,RYAN>这记者证是谁花钱买的
<28-13,RYAN>Who paid you for that pass?

747
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,250
<28-14,FRANK>我已经把我知道的都说了
<28-14,FRANK>I've told you everything I know.

748
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,510
<28-14,FRANK>你就只能知道这么多  因为...
<28-14,FRANK>And that's all you're gonna get 'cause...

749
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:37,320
<28-14,FRANK>我们都很清楚警察进监狱会有什么下场
<28-14,FRANK>We both know what happens to cops in prison.

750
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:41,060
<28-14,FRANK>我不会去自首的
<28-14,FRANK>And I ain't turning myself in.

751
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:44,950
<28-15,RYAN>弗兰克
<28-15,RYAN>Frank.

752
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,190
<28-15,RYAN>弗兰克
<28-15,RYAN>Frank!

753
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,570
<29-1,BECKETT>莱恩  抱歉
<29-1,BECKETT>Ryan, I'm so sorry.

754
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:13,290
<29-2,RYAN>我姐姐还会更加难过
<29-2,RYAN>Well, it's gonna be a lot harder on my sister.

755
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:17,950
<29-2,RYAN>但至少不是弗兰克开的枪
<29-2,RYAN>But at least Frank isn't our shooter.

756
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:19,080
<29-3,CASTLE>他知道是谁开的吗
<29-3,CASTLE>Does he know who is?

757
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:22,410
<29-4,RYAN>不知道  他收到一个装有五千块钱的信封
<29-4,RYAN>No, he received $5,000 in an envelope

758
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:24,740
<29-4,RYAN>还有一个放记者证的地址
<29-4,RYAN>along with an address of where to leave to press pass.

759
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:25,900
<29-5,BECKETT>钱是谁付的
<29-5,BECKETT>And who paid him?

760
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:28,500
<29-6,RYAN>跟他联系的是一个叫曼哈顿政治的组织
<29-6,RYAN>He was contacted by an outfit called Manhattan Politics.

761
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,940
<29-6,RYAN>发现电邮是假的
<29-6,RYAN>Turns out it's a front with a dead e-mail address.

762
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:32,950
<29-7,CASTLE>这组织背后的人陷害了艾里克·钱伯斯
<29-7,CASTLE>So, whoever's behind this set up Eric Chambers

763
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:34,210
<29-7,CASTLE>并利用了弗兰克
<29-7,CASTLE>and used Frank to do it.

764
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:36,150
<29-8,BECKETT>这笔钱我们能追踪吗
<29-8,BECKETT>Can we trace the money?

765
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,110
<29-9,RYAN>还没查到  不过这钱是连号的
<29-9,RYAN>No luck so far. Though the bills are sequential.

766
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:40,890
<29-9,RYAN>有可能是从银行取出来的
<29-9,RYAN>So it probably came from a bank withdrawal.

767
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:41,980
<29-10,CASTLE>那信封呢
<29-10,CASTLE>What about the envelope?

768
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,870
<29-11,RYAN>鉴证组提取到了部分指纹
<29-11,RYAN>CSU pulled off a partial print,

769
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,470
<29-11,RYAN>但还不足以和数据库比对
<29-11,RYAN>but it's not enough to run against the database.

770
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:47,820
<29-12,BECKETT>也许不用比对
<29-12,BECKETT>Maybe we don't have to.

771
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:49,930
<29-13,RYAN>什么意思
<29-13,RYAN>What do you mean?

772
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:52,750
<29-14,CASTLE>根据卡洛琳·戴克手机上的短信
<29-14,CASTLE>Well, given the texts we found on Carolyn Decker's phone,

773
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,870
<29-14,CASTLE>我们可能只需查一个名字
<29-14,CASTLE>we may only have to check one name.

774
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,960
<30-1,MIA>亚历克斯一会就能出院了
<30-1,MIA>Alex will be discharged later today,

775
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,850
<30-1,MIA>对于来自各地的支持
<30-1,MIA>and we are so grateful and humbled

776
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,960
<30-1,MIA>我们深表感激
<30-1,MIA>by the outpouring of support from all over the world.

777
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,840
<30-1,MIA>而同时我们也为
<30-1,MIA>But it's also a time of mourning

778
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:11,010
<30-1,MIA>卡洛琳·戴克的惨死深感悲痛
<30-1,MIA>for the tragic death of Carolyn Decker.

779
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:15,470
<30-1,MIA>我的丈夫将继续为这个国家的人民奋斗
<30-1,MIA>My husband will honor her name by continuing to fight

780
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:17,170
<30-1,MIA>继续为那些无法反映心声的人们努力
<30-1,MIA>for the people of this country

781
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:20,530
<30-1,MIA>以此来作为对她的纪念
<30-1,MIA>and for those who voices aren't always heard.

782
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:22,660
<30-1,MIA>谢谢
<30-1,MIA>Thank you.

783
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:25,710
<30-2,BECKETT>打扰一下
<30-2,BECKETT>Excuse me.

784

<30-3,MIA>Detective Beckett, Mr. Castle, what brings you here?

<30-3,MIA>这个
<30-3,MIA>This.

786
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:32,740
<30-4,BECKETT>这里装着用来给艾里克·钱伯斯
<30-4,BECKETT>It contained cash used to buy a press pass

787
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:34,030
<30-4,BECKETT>买记者证的钱
<30-4,BECKETT>for Eric Chambers.

788
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:37,220
<30-5,MIA>记者证  杀手就是这么混进来的吗
<30-5,MIA>A press pass? That's how the assassin got in?

789
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:37,980
<30-6,CASTLE>你应该知道
<30-6,CASTLE>Well, you should know.

790
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,550
<30-6,CASTLE>信封上有你的指纹
<30-6,CASTLE>You're fingerprint is on the envelope.

792
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,450
<30-7,BECKETT>因为我们找不到你
<30-7,BECKETT>Because we can't account for you.

793
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:49,170
<30-8,MIA>你们难道认为我企图谋杀亲夫
<30-8,MIA>You can't be suggesting that I tried to kill my husband.

794
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:50,720
<30-9,CASTLE>不  不  当然不是
<30-9,CASTLE>Oh, no. No, no, not at all.

795
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,100
<30-9,CASTLE>我们认为你试图谋杀卡洛琳·戴克
<30-9,CASTLE>We're suggesting you tried to kill Carolyn Decker

796
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:54,410
<30-9,CASTLE>且成功了
<30-9,CASTLE>and succeeded.

797
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:57,660
<30-10,MIA>这指控既荒谬又卑鄙
<30-10,MIA>That's ridiculous and despicable.

798
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:01,170
<30-11,BECKETT>这是你丈夫与卡洛琳之间的短讯
<30-11,BECKETT>These are texts between your husband and Carolyn.

799
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:03,930
<30-12,CASTLE>有三年之久  那是奸情开始的时候
<30-12,CASTLE>Going back three years, when their affair first started.

800
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,900
<30-13,BECKETT>这是杀人动机  洛佩兹太太
<30-13,BECKETT>That's motive for murder, Mrs. Lopez.

801
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:08,090
<30-14,CASTLE>或许是纯粹的个人恩怨
<30-14,CASTLE>Now, maybe it was purely personal,

802
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:09,880
<30-14,CASTLE>或许是因为你把她看作是
<30-14,CASTLE>or maybe you saw her as a liability

803
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,720
<30-14,CASTLE>你丈夫成为总统的不利因素
<30-14,CASTLE>to your husband's chances of becoming president.

804
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:14,100
<30-14,CASTLE>无论如何  必须除掉卡洛琳·戴克
<30-14,CASTLE>Either way, Carolyn Decker had to go.

805
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,660
<30-15,BECKETT>但你得保证此事不会牵连到你身上
<30-15,BECKETT>But you had to make sure that it didn't lead back to you.

806
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:18,920
<30-16,CASTLE>于是你设局
<30-16,CASTLE>So, you created a narrative

807
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:21,620
<30-16,CASTLE>搞得好像洛佩兹先生被刺客刺杀
<30-16,CASTLE>where Mr. Lopez was being targeted by an assassin,

808
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:24,070
<30-16,CASTLE>让艾里克·钱伯斯做替罪羊
<30-16,CASTLE>and Eric Chambers was the patsy.

809
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:26,020
<30-16,CASTLE>这个计划既能提升你丈夫
<30-16,CASTLE>A plan which happened to raise your husband's profile

810
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,680
<30-16,CASTLE>在国内的关注度  如我们所见
<30-16,CASTLE>on the national stage, as we just saw.

811
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,550
<30-17,MIA>-好样的  -你们以为我不知道他俩的奸情吗
<30-17,MIA>- Well done. - You don't think I knew about the affair?

812
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:35,540
<30-17,MIA>我嫁给亚历克斯的时候  就知道会面对什么局面
<30-17,MIA>I understood the deal I was making when I married Alex.

813
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,820
<30-17,MIA>卡洛琳可不是不利因素
<30-17,MIA>And far from a liability,

814
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:40,300
<30-17,MIA>她是他的幕后顾问
<30-17,MIA>Carolyn was his behind-the-scenes advisor.

815
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,920
<30-17,MIA>通过她  他找到了很多支持他的
<30-17,MIA>She was a conduit to major donors

816
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,830
<30-18,BECKETT>-巨额捐献人  -枪击时你在哪  洛佩兹太太
<30-18,BECKETT>- who backed him -- - Where were you during the shooting mrs. Lopez?

817
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:52,650
<30-19,MIA>亚历克斯和我有个协议
<30-19,MIA>Alex and I have an agreement.

818
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:56,840
<30-19,MIA>我在宾馆
<30-19,MIA>I was at the hotel.

819
00:37:57,830 --> 00:37:59,410
<30-19,MIA>717房间
<30-19,MIA>Room 717.

820
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:06,550
<30-19,MIA>如果真的有必要  我可以告诉你她的名字
<30-19,MIA>I can give you her name if it's absolutely necessary.

821
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:07,430
<30-20,BECKETT>有必要
<30-20,BECKETT>It will be.

822
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:10,540
<30-20,BECKETT>但这还是解释不了你的指纹
<30-20,BECKETT>But it still doesn't explain away your fingerprint.

823
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:14,870
<30-21,MIA>这信封来自亚历克斯的办公室
<30-21,MIA>This envelope is from Alex's office.

824
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:17,790
<30-21,MIA>我知道是因为办公用品都是我订购的
<30-21,MIA>I know that because I ordered the stationary.

825
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:19,500
<30-21,MIA>我有时在那帮忙
<30-21,MIA>I help out there sometimes.

826
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,570
<30-21,MIA>我给他的选民寄信
<30-21,MIA>I send letters to his constituents.

827
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,540
<30-21,MIA>我肯定是在那期间摸过这信封
<30-21,MIA>I must have touched it at some point.

828
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:25,280
<30-22,CASTLE>还有谁能拿到他的信封
<30-22,CASTLE>Who else has access to his envelopes?

829
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,690
<31-1,LOPEZ>我不明白
<31-1,LOPEZ>I'm afraid I don't understand.

830
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:33,570
<31-1,LOPEZ>你认为我的人参与其中
<31-1,LOPEZ>So, you think that one of my people played a part in this?

831
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:36,340
<31-2,MEGAN>那不可能  我亲自审核过所有员工
<31-2,MEGAN>Well, that's impossible. I-I personally vetted everyone.

832
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:37,750
<31-3,RYAN>当我们知晓从何查探
<31-3,RYAN>Once we knew where to look,

833
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:40,020
<31-3,RYAN>我们找到了账单的匹配记录
<31-3,RYAN>we matched the serial numbers from those bills

834
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:42,300
<31-3,RYAN>出自你的银行账户提款
<31-3,RYAN>to a withdrawal from your bank account.

835
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:44,930
<31-5,BECKETT>-我的  -准确地说  是你的竞选出行账户
<31-5,BECKETT>- My bank? - Specifically, your campaign travel account.

836
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:46,290
<31-5,BECKETT>那不可能
<31-5,BECKETT>That can't be.

837
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:48,640
<31-6,LOPEZ>我是唯一有授权使用那账户的人
<31-6,LOPEZ>I'm the only one authorized to access the account --

838
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,370
<31-6,LOPEZ>只有我
<31-6,LOPEZ>Just me.

839
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:52,370
<31-7,CASTLE>-和梅根  -她刚好
<31-7,CASTLE>- and Megan. - Who is, oddly enough,

840
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:54,540
<31-7,CASTLE>出现在银行安保录像中
<31-7,CASTLE>who showed up on the bank security video

841
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,020
<31-7,CASTLE>进行提款
<31-7,CASTLE>making the withdrawal.

842
00:38:56,770 --> 00:38:58,420
<31-8,MEGAN>亚历克斯  这太荒谬了
<31-8,MEGAN>Alex, this is a mistake.

843
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:01,170
<31-8,MEGAN>我不会那么做  我没理由那么做
<31-8,MEGAN>I would never do this. I have no reason to.

844
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:03,460
<31-9,BECKETT>那可不是实话
<31-9,BECKETT>That's not exactly true.

845
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:05,590
<31-9,BECKETT>我们仔细查看了卡洛琳的短讯
<31-9,BECKETT>We looked into Carolyn's texts again.

846
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:07,150
<31-9,BECKETT>她对你有所担忧
<31-9,BECKETT>She had misgivings about you.

847
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,210
<31-10,RYAN>卡洛琳认为在合适的团队支持下
<31-10,RYAN>Carolyn believed that you could make it

848
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:11,820
<31-10,RYAN>你有希望一路晋级  成为总统
<31-10,RYAN>all the way to the presidency with the right team in place,

849
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:14,410
<31-10,RYAN>但她认为梅根不属于那个团队
<31-10,RYAN>but she didn't think that Megan belonged on that team.

850
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,180
<31-11,CASTLE>想到被排挤在外
<31-11,CASTLE>The thought of being cast aside

851
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:18,550
<31-11,CASTLE>令你无法忍受  于是你想出一招
<31-11,CASTLE>was more than you could bear. So you came up with a plan

852
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:19,840
<31-12,RYAN>既能除掉威胁
<31-12,RYAN>that would eliminate your problem

853
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:22,050
<31-12,RYAN>又能让你的上司得到全国的同情
<31-12,RYAN>and win your boss the sympathy of a nation --

854
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:23,370
<31-12,RYAN>一石二鸟
<31-12,RYAN>Two birds with one stone.

855
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:24,460
<31-13,BECKETT>我们拿到搜查令
<31-13,BECKETT>We got a search warrant

856
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:26,130
<31-13,BECKETT>搜查你的公寓  梅根
<31-13,BECKETT>to look into your apartment, megan.

857
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:27,860
<31-13,BECKETT>你穿的大衣上
<31-13,BECKETT>The coat that you were wearing

858
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:30,150
<31-13,BECKETT>检测出射击残留物
<31-13,BECKETT>tested positive for gunshot residue.

859
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:33,270
<31-14,LOPEZ>你杀了卡洛琳
<31-14,LOPEZ>You killed Carolyn.

860
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:36,390
<31-14,LOPEZ>梅根  你怎么能这么做
<31-14,LOPEZ>Megan, how -- how could you do that?

861
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:38,990
<31-14,LOPEZ>我怎么能
<31-14,LOPEZ>How could I?

862
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,010
<31-14,LOPEZ>你怎么能那样
<31-14,LOPEZ>How could you?

863
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:44,250
<31-15,MEGAN>你从市议会起家时
<31-15,MEGAN>When you started at city council,

864
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:46,430
<31-15,MEGAN>我为你在人家草坪上插宣传板
<31-15,MEGAN>I was putting signs on people's lawns,

865
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:49,430
<31-15,MEGAN>我在大冷天中为你分发传单
<31-15,MEGAN>I was passing out pamphlets in the freezing cold.

866
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:52,440
<31-15,MEGAN>我为你写演讲稿  我为你做账单
<31-15,MEGAN>I write your speeches. I craft your bills.

867
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:55,180
<31-15,MEGAN>我把全部都给了你
<31-15,MEGAN>I have invested my entire life in you,

868
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,620
<31-15,MEGAN>满足你的一切需求
<31-15,MEGAN>In doing whatever it is you need me to do.

869
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,780
<31-15,MEGAN>我做的很好
<31-15,MEGAN>And I've done it well.

870
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:02,660
<31-15,MEGAN>那些付出不应该被如此对待
<31-15,MEGAN>That should count for something.

871
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,640
<31-16,RYAN>梅根·布鲁克斯  你因谋杀
<31-16,RYAN>Megan Brooks, you're under arrest

872
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,170
<31-16,RYAN>卡洛琳·戴克而被捕
<31-16,RYAN>for the murder of Carolyn Decker.

873
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,150
<32-1,BECKETT>背后插刀  出轨  背叛
<32-1,BECKETT>Backstabbing, adultery, and betrayal --

874
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:14,700
<32-1,BECKETT>我就是因为这个讨厌政治
<32-1,BECKETT>That is why I hate politics.

875
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:17,020
<32-1,BECKETT>人民的代表应该是可敬的
<32-1,BECKETT>Representatives of the people should be honorable.

876
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:18,500
<32-1,BECKETT>值得信任的
<32-1,BECKETT>They should be trustworthy.

877
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,750
<32-2,CASTLE>有些是这样的
<32-2,CASTLE>Well, I'm sure some of them are,

878
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,540
<32-2,CASTLE>但华盛顿可能需要
<32-2,CASTLE>But Washington could probably use

879
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:23,940
<32-2,CASTLE>多一些像你这样思考的人
<32-2,CASTLE>a few more people that think the way you do.

880
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,360
<32-2,CASTLE>这是什么
<32-2,CASTLE>What's this?

882
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,500
<32-3,BECKETT>学习材料
<32-3,BECKETT>Oh, study materials.

883
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,310
<32-4,CASTLE>警监考试
<32-4,CASTLE>For the Captain's exam.

884
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:34,510
<32-4,CASTLE>-你要考吗  -这是我的下一步
<32-4,CASTLE>- So you're gonna go for it? - Well, it's the next step.

885
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:36,380
<32-5,BECKETT>还不确定这是该走的那条路
<32-5,BECKETT>I'm not sure if it's the right one yet,

886
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:38,270
<32-5,BECKETT>但想考考  看我能考成什么样
<32-5,BECKETT>But I figured I'd take the test, see how I do.

887
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:39,620
<32-6,CASTLE>如果考过了呢
<32-6,CASTLE>And if you do well?

888
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:41,680
<32-7,BECKETT>也许那会帮我做出决定
<32-7,BECKETT>Then maybe that'll make my decision for me.

889
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:43,500
<32-7,BECKETT>-准备好回家了吗  -是的
<32-7,BECKETT>- You ready to go home? - Yeah.

890
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:50,950
<33-1,FRANK>我该怎么跟她说
<33-1,FRANK>What am I gonna tell her?

891
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:54,200
<33-2,RYAN>唯一能说的就是真相
<33-2,RYAN>The only thing you can -- the truth.

892
00:40:54,810 --> 00:40:55,990
<33-3,FRANK>我搞砸了
<33-3,FRANK>I messed everything up.

893
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:58,470
<33-3,FRANK>即便是签了认罪协议  我还是要入狱
<33-3,FRANK>Even with a plea deal, I'm going to jail.

894
00:40:58,470 --> 00:40:59,720
<33-4,RYAN>未必
<33-4,RYAN>No, you don't know that.

895
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:06,660
<33-5,FRANK>格温会恨我的
<33-5,FRANK>Gwen's gonna hate me...

896
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,630
<33-5,FRANK>我说了谎
<33-5,FRANK>For lying...

897
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:12,070
<33-5,FRANK>没能成为我应该成为的男子汉
<33-5,FRANK>And for not being the man I said I was.

898
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:16,240
<33-6,RYAN>她很坚强  比你想象的坚强
<33-6,RYAN>She's strong, frank. Stronger than you think.

899
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,460
<33-7,FRANK>我不知道是该敲门  还是直接开门
<33-7,FRANK>I don't know if I should knock or just open the door.

900
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:35,710
<33-8,FRANK>我错了  格温
<33-8,FRANK>I'm sorry, gwennie.

901
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:38,050
<33-8,FRANK>我很抱歉
<33-8,FRANK>I'm so sorry.

902
00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:42,100
<33-9,GWEN>我们会撑过去的  宝贝
<33-9,GWEN>We'll get through it, baby.

903
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:44,170
<33-9,GWEN>会撑过去的
<33-9,GWEN>We'll figure it out.
