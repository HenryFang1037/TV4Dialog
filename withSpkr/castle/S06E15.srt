<1-1,KRIS HOWARD>Take the 65th street transverse across the park.

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,850
<1-2,HILLARY COOPER>第五大道游客太多  交通太堵
<1-2,HILLARY COOPER>Freaking tourists on 5th avenue always screw up traffic.

4
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:17,650
<1-4,HILLARY>-是麦迪森  -估计她要迟到
<1-4,HILLARY>- It's Madison. - Probably running late.

<1-7,MADISON>Sure this comes as a shock to you, but I'm running late.

7

<1-10,MADISON>Anyways, I'm on my way in five.

11
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:37,350
<1-10,MADISON>你们听到了吗
<1-10,MADISON>Did you hear that?

12

<1-12,MADISON>Who's there?

15
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,230

16
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:49,860
<1-13,MADISON>天呐

17
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:51,710
<1-14,KRIS>麦迪森
<1-14,KRIS>Madison?!

22
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:07,070
<2-1,RICHARD CASTLE>要不要放点音乐
<2-1,RICHARD CASTLE>Uh, shall I put on a little music?

24
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,860
<2-2,KATE BECKETT>你想让我性致盎然吗  卡塞尔
<2-2,KATE BECKETT>Are you trying to get me in the mood, Castle?

25
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:11,410
<2-3,CASTLE>是的  兴致盎然来挑选
<2-3,CASTLE>Yes, I am -- in the mood to select

26
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:13,910
<2-3,CASTLE>一支出色的婚礼乐队
<2-3,CASTLE>one of these amazing wedding bands.

27
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:17,270
<2-5,CASTLE>我已经筛选掉很多了  就剩最后五支
<2-5,CASTLE>I've weeded out the hacks and selected five finalists.

28
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:18,560
<2-6,BECKETT>乐队
<2-6,BECKETT>A band?

29
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:20,900
<2-6,BECKETT>没有DJ算什么派对啊
<2-6,BECKETT>What's a party without a deejay?

30
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:21,930
<2-7,CASTLE>这话随口一说  是吧
<2-7,CASTLE>That's rhetorical, right?

31
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:22,600
<2-8,BECKETT>拜托  卡塞尔  我可不想
<2-8,BECKETT>Come on, Castle, I don't want

32
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,510
<2-8,BECKETT>某个俗气的乐队队长在咱俩跳第一支舞
<2-8,BECKETT>some cheesy band leader trying to imitate Sinatra

33
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:27,650
<2-8,BECKETT>《巫术》的时候在边上模仿西纳特拉
<2-8,BECKETT>when we're dancing our first dance to "Witchcraft".

35
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:29,650
<2-8,BECKETT>我要老蓝眼睛本人[西纳特拉昵称]
<2-8,BECKETT>I want Ol' Blue Eyes himself.

36
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:31,710
<2-9,CASTLE>可惜  他没空[98年过世]
<2-9,CASTLE>Uh, well, sadly, he's not available.

37
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:34,710
<2-10,BECKETT>但DJ可以播放他的唱片
<2-10,BECKETT>No, but his recordings are via a deejay.

38
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:37,330
<2-11,CASTLE>能先倒回去吗  我们为什么要跳《巫术》
<2-11,CASTLE>Can we go back a second? Why would we be dancing to "Witchcraft"?

39
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:38,260
<2-12,BECKETT>因为这是我们的歌
<2-12,BECKETT>'cause it's our song.

40
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:39,240
<2-13,CASTLE>什么时候的事
<2-13,CASTLE>Since when?

41
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,980
<2-14,BECKETT>自从我们去年夏天在汉普顿斯的卡拉OK酒吧唱过
<2-14,BECKETT>Since we sang it at the karaoke bar in the Hamptons last summer.

42
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,720
<2-15,CASTLE>我们的歌不是
<2-15,CASTLE>I thought our song was

43
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,770
<2-15,CASTLE>布鲁斯·斯普林斯汀的《黑夜起舞》吗
<2-15,CASTLE>Bruce Springsteen's "Dancing In the Dark".

44
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:46,660
<2-16,BECKETT>什么时候的事
<2-16,BECKETT>Since when?

45
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,530
<2-17,CASTLE>自从我让灯塔酒吧的老板
<2-17,CASTLE>Since I had the boss pull you onstage

46
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:50,110
<2-17,CASTLE>拉你上台模仿柯特妮·考克斯[老友记女演员]
<2-17,CASTLE>Courtney-Cox style at the Beacon.

47
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:52,510
<2-18,CASTLE_BECKETT>我们没有属于自己的歌吗
<2-18,CASTLE_BECKETT>Do we not have a song?

48
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,550
<2-19,CASTLE>我们肯定有的吧
<2-19,CASTLE>We must have a song.

49
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:57,490
<2-20,BECKETT>我们的歌就是这铃声
<2-20,BECKETT>It looks like they're playing it now.

51
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:02,540
<2-20,BECKETT>萨顿区发生凶杀案
<2-20,BECKETT>Murder at Sutton Place.

52
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:10,860
<3-1,CASTLE>好高档的凶杀地点
<3-1,CASTLE>Fancy address for a homicide.

53
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,920
<3-2,KEVIN RYAN>有钱人家
<3-2,KEVIN RYAN>Fancy family.

54
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:16,780
<3-2,KEVIN RYAN>死者麦迪森·博蒙特是高三...
<3-2,KEVIN RYAN>Our victim, Madison Beaumont -- she was a senior at, uh --

55
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:20,060
<3-3,CASTLE>菲克罗夫特预备学校  我认得这个饰章
<3-3,CASTLE>Faircroft Preparatory Academy. I recognize the crest.

56
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,800
<3-3,CASTLE>我成功道路上去过的众多学校中的一所
<3-3,CASTLE>One of the many schools I attended on my road to greatness.

57
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,290
<3-4,BECKETT>有打斗迹象
<3-4,BECKETT>Okay, so, there's signs of struggle.

58
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,070
<3-4,BECKETT>看来麦迪森反抗了
<3-4,BECKETT>Looks like Madison put up a fight.

59
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:28,870
<3-4,BECKETT>她一个人在家吗
<3-4,BECKETT>Was she here alone?

60
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:31,260
<3-5,RYAN>是的  父母晚上出去了
<3-5,RYAN>Yeah. Parents were gone for the evening.

61
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,490
<3-5,RYAN>母亲是设计师
<3-5,RYAN>Mother's a designer.

62
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:34,210
<3-5,RYAN>父亲是很厉害的辩护律师
<3-5,RYAN>Father's some high-powered defense attorney.

63
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:35,250
<3-6,BECKETT>强行入室吗
<3-6,BECKETT>Forced entry?

64
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,860
<3-7,RYAN>不是  家里也没丢东西
<3-7,RYAN>Nope. Nothing's missing, either,

65
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,910
<3-7,RYAN>可能不是盗窃出了岔子
<3-7,RYAN>so probably wasn't a burglary gone wrong.

66
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:42,810
<3-8,BECKETT>椽上的是血吗
<3-8,BECKETT>Is that blood up there on the rafter?

67
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,140
<3-9,LANIE PARISH>是的  她的血
<3-9,LANIE PARISH>Yes, and it's hers.

68
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,420
<3-10,CASTLE>怎么到这上面去的
<3-10,CASTLE>How'd it get up there?

69
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:47,930
<3-11,RYAN>就我们所知
<3-11,RYAN>Well, as far as we can tell,

70
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:50,420
<3-11,RYAN>是凶手把麦迪森扔上去的
<3-11,RYAN>our killer threw Madison up there.

71
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,000
<3-12,LANIE>可能这就是她的死因
<3-12,LANIE>Which is probably what killed her.

72
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,390
<3-12,LANIE>她有严重颅脑损伤
<3-12,LANIE>She has a major intracranial injury.

73
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:56,630
<3-13,CASTLE>她被扔上了天花板
<3-13,CASTLE>She was thrown against the ceiling?

74
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:00,330
<3-13,CASTLE>这简直是超人的行为  几乎不可能实现
<3-13,CASTLE>That is a superhuman feat bordering on physically impossible.

75
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,040
<3-14,BECKETT>好了  卡塞尔  说出来吧
<3-14,BECKETT>Okay, Castle, let's hear it.

76
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,620
<3-14,BECKETT>你有什么稀奇古怪的理论
<3-14,BECKETT>What's your outlandish theory?

77
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:05,000
<3-15,CASTLE>这还不明显吗
<3-15,CASTLE>Isn't it obvious?

78
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:07,330
<3-15,CASTLE>麦迪森惹恼了绿巨人
<3-15,CASTLE>Madison made the Hulk angry.

79
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:09,740
<3-16,LANIE>不管是不是绿巨人
<3-16,LANIE>Well, Hulk or no Hulk,

80
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,240
<3-16,LANIE>肝温表明死亡时间
<3-16,LANIE>liver temp puts the time of death

81
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,320
<3-16,LANIE>在今晚八点到十点
<3-16,LANIE>somewhere between 8:00 and 10:00 tonight.

82
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,010
<3-17,RYAN>符合报警电话的时间
<3-17,RYAN>Which fits with our 911 call.

83
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:18,190
<3-17,RYAN>电话是在9点08分由一位的哥打进来的
<3-17,RYAN>Call came in at 9:08 from a cabbie

84
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,170
<3-17,RYAN>报警人声称这个地址有人收到攻击
<3-17,RYAN>saying that someone was being attacked at this address.

85
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:22,150
<3-18,BECKETT>出租车  他目睹整个凶案了吗
<3-18,BECKETT>A cabbie? Did he witness the murder?

86
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,800
<3-19,RYAN>还不清楚
<3-19,RYAN>We're still not clear on that.

87
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,880
<3-19,RYAN>我们还在找他
<3-19,RYAN>We're trying to track him down.

88
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,190
<3-19,RYAN>同时  埃斯波在警局跟麦迪森的家人谈话
<3-19,RYAN>Meanwhile, Espo's talking with Madison's family back at the precinct.

89
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:33,540
<3-19,RYAN>要是我们待在家没出去就好了
<3-19,RYAN>If only we'd stayed home instead of going to dinner.

90
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:36,710
<3-19,RYAN>我们想给麦迪森一点空间
<3-19,RYAN>We wanted to give Madison her space.

91
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,050
<3-19,RYAN>我们最近经常吵架
<3-19,RYAN>We've been fighting a lot.

92
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:39,450
<4-1,JAVIER ESPOSITO>吵些什么
<4-1,JAVIER ESPOSITO>About what?

93
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,630
<4-1,JAVIER ESPOSITO>她不学习  不跟我们说话...
<4-1,JAVIER ESPOSITO>Her not studying, her not talking to us --

94
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,300
<4-2,ESPOSITO>就是平常的青少年琐事
<4-2,ESPOSITO>normal teenage stuff.

95
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,000
<4-2,ESPOSITO>我得问问
<4-2,ESPOSITO>I have to ask.

96
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:51,370
<4-2,ESPOSITO>你们知道有谁想伤害你们的女儿吗
<4-2,ESPOSITO>Do you know of anybody who might want to hurt your daughter?

97
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:52,880
<4-2,ESPOSITO>没有
<4-2,ESPOSITO>No. No, of course not.

98
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,530
<4-2,ESPOSITO>麦迪森朋友非常多
<4-2,ESPOSITO>Madison had so many friends.

99

103
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,010
<4-3,ESPOSITO>我们认为凶手
<4-3,ESPOSITO>Well, we think whoever did this

104
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:10,190
<4-3,ESPOSITO>一定非常强壮  肌肉发达
<4-3,ESPOSITO>had to be unusually strong -- muscular, maybe.

105
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,730
<4-3,ESPOSITO>你们知道她认识的人当中有谁...
<4-3,ESPOSITO>Do you know of anybody in her life --

106

00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,870
<4-4,ESPOSITO>查尔斯  会不会是莱利
<4-4,ESPOSITO>Charles, what about Riley?

108
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,260
<4-4,ESPOSITO>莱利是谁

111
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,920
<6-2,BECKETT>他不是很能接受
<6-2,BECKETT>He didn't take it well.

112
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:25,710
<5-1,BECKETT>莱利·米奇姆
<5-1,BECKETT>Riley Mitchum --

113
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,830
<5-1,BECKETT>根据菲克罗夫特橄榄球队官网的资料
<5-1,BECKETT>According to the Faircroft football website,

<5-1,BECKETT>他就是你说的绿巨人  卡塞尔
<5-1,BECKETT>There's your Hulk, Castle.

116
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,670
<5-2,CASTLE>杀人可跟菲克罗夫特
<5-2,CASTLE>Well, though murder is at odds

117
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:36,010
<5-2,CASTLE>灌输给学生的价值观格格不入
<5-2,CASTLE>with the values instilled in a Faircroft man.

118
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,090
<5-2,CASTLE>高中以后我就没来过这里了
<5-2,CASTLE>I haven't been back here since I was a senior.

119

<5-3,BECKETT>你就是从这儿毕业的咯
<5-3,BECKETT>So, this is where you graduated, huh?

120
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:43,520
<5-4,CASTLE>本来是那样的  如果不是
<5-4,CASTLE>Well, I would have, if it wasn't for the fact

121
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,560
<5-4,CASTLE>某夜我和小伙伴们溜进学校

122
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,270
<5-4,CASTLE>把一头奶牛推上12层楼的楼顶的话
<5-4,CASTLE>and pushed a cow up 12 flights of stairs onto the roof.

123
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:51,000
<5-5,BECKETT>-奶牛  真的吗  -嗯
<5-5,BECKETT>- A cow? Really? - Yep.

124
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,670
<5-6,CASTLE>然后呢
<5-6,CASTLE>So, what happened?

125
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:52,780
<5-7,BECKETT>你们被开除了吗
<5-7,BECKETT>Did you guys get expelled?

126
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:55,720
<5-8,CASTLE>不  只有我  不像其他人那样团结一心
<5-8,CASTLE>No, just me. I wasn't connected like my buddies were.

127
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,730
<5-8,CASTLE>我成绩好不合群  所以被开除了
<5-8,CASTLE>I was the scholarship kid, so I got the boot.

128
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,590
<5-9,BECKETT>你后来发展得很好啊
<5-9,BECKETT>Well, I think you turned out all right.

129
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:00,720
<5-10,CASTLE>英雄所见略同
<5-10,CASTLE>Me, too.

130
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,950
<6-1,RILEY MITCHUM>这事太可怕了
<6-1,RILEY MITCHUM>Man, this is awful.

131
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:05,160
<6-1,RILEY MITCHUM>麦迪森是我的初恋啊
<6-1,RILEY MITCHUM>I mean, Madison was, like, my first love.

132
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,790
<6-2,BECKETT>她把你甩了  你一定很受伤吧
<6-2,BECKETT>Must've hurt when she broke up with you.

133
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:08,970
<6-3,RILEY>等等  你们理解错了
<6-3,RILEY>Wait, y-you guys got it all wrong.

134
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:10,360
<6-3,RILEY>是我甩了她
<6-3,RILEY>I broke up with her.

135
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,390
<6-4,BECKETT>她母亲不是这么说的
<6-4,BECKETT>Mm, not according to her mom.

136
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:14,720
<6-5,RILEY>她父母什么都不知道  好吗
<6-5,RILEY>Man, her -- her parents didn't have a clue, okay?

137
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,580
<6-5,RILEY>几个月前
<6-5,RILEY>A couple months ago,

138
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,760
<6-5,RILEY>麦迪森开始每晚都外出
<6-5,RILEY>Madison started going out all times of the night.

139
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:19,210
<6-5,RILEY>也不肯告诉我她在忙些什么
<6-5,RILEY>She wouldn't tell me what she was up to.

140
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:20,770
<6-6,CASTLE>她是去见其他人吗
<6-6,CASTLE>Was she seeing someone else?

141
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:23,620
<6-7,RILEY>我觉得是这样  但我没查出是谁
<6-7,RILEY>I figured she had to be, but I never found out who.

142
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,150
<6-8,BECKETT>你昨晚在哪
<6-8,BECKETT>Where were you last night?

143
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,140
<6-9,RILEY>跟我的新女友在一起  你们可以去问她
<6-9,RILEY>Was with...My new girl. You can ask her.

144
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,350
<6-10,BECKETT>名字告诉我  我要确认一下
<6-10,BECKETT>Okay, well, I'm gonna need a name to confirm that.

145
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,370
<6-10,BECKETT>失陪一下
<6-10,BECKETT>Excuse me.

146
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,270
<6-11,RYAN>-贝克特  -莱恩
<6-11,RYAN>- Hey, Beckett. - Hey, Ryan.

147
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,210
<6-12,BECKETT>你去查一下
<6-12,BECKETT>I need you to check into

148
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,570
<6-12,BECKETT>麦迪森的通话记录和最近的活动
<6-12,BECKETT>Madison's phone records and recent activity.

149
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:43,230
<6-12,BECKETT>找找她最新结识了什么人
<6-12,BECKETT>Look for anyone new in her life.

150
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:46,070
<7-1,RYAN>好的  我们找到那个的哥了
<7-1,RYAN>You got it. Meantime, we located that cabbie.

151
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:49,000
<7-1,RYAN>他说两名女乘客在视频通话里看到袭击了
<7-1,RYAN>He says two female passengers saw the attack on a video call.

152
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,690
<7-1,RYAN>她们让他报警
<7-1,RYAN>They told him to call 911.

153
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:52,150
<7-1,RYAN>然后就逃下车了
<7-1,RYAN>Then they bolted from the cab.

154
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:54,440
<7-2,ESPOSITO>但他把姑娘们上车的地点告诉我们了
<7-2,ESPOSITO>But he gave us the building where he picked the girls up,

155
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,850
<7-2,ESPOSITO>门卫认出了她们
<7-2,ESPOSITO>and the doorman there I.D.'d them.

156
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:58,000
<7-3,BECKETT>-她们现在在哪  -就在你那
<7-3,BECKETT>- Where are they now? - Same place you are.

157
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:02,510
<7-3,BECKETT>克丽丝·霍华德  希拉里·库珀
<7-3,BECKETT>Kris Howard? Hillary Cooper?

158
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:05,210
<7-3,BECKETT>是关于麦迪森的  对吧
<7-3,BECKETT>It's about Madison, isn't it?

159
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:09,540
<7-3,BECKETT>凶案当时我们正在视频通话
<7-3,BECKETT>We were facetiming with her when it happened.

160
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,530
<7-3,BECKETT>太恐怖了
<7-3,BECKETT>It was horrifying.

161
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:13,740
<9-1,KRIS>那你们为什么不报警
<9-1,KRIS>Well, then, why didn't you call 911?

162
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,370
<9-2,BECKETT>我们太害怕
<9-2,BECKETT>We just panicked.

163
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:16,770
<9-3,HILLARY>我们吓坏了
<9-3,HILLARY>We were scared.

164
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:17,620
<9-4,CASTLE>怕什么
<9-4,CASTLE>Of what?

165
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,110
<9-5,KRIS>害怕成为下一个
<9-5,KRIS>That we'd be next.

166
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:23,460
<9-6,CASTLE>下一个  什么  凶手看见你们了
<9-6,CASTLE>Next? What, did the attacker see you?

167
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,540
<9-7,KRIS>没有  但是
<9-7,KRIS>No, but...

168
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,530
<9-8,BECKETT>什么
<9-8,BECKETT>What?

169
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:31,820
<9-9,KRIS>两周前
<9-9,KRIS>Look, uh, two weeks ago,

170
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,710
<9-9,KRIS>在食堂发生了一件事
<9-9,KRIS>this thing happened in the cafeteria --

171
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:36,820
<9-10,HILLARY>校长说过我们不能谈论这件事
<9-10,HILLARY>The principal said we're not supposed to talk about it.

172
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,510
<9-11,CASTLE>什么事
<9-11,CASTLE>About what?

173
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:42,180
<9-12,HILLARY>你们还是去问他吧
<9-12,HILLARY>You'll have to ask him.

174
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,190
<10-1,ASSISTANT>校长稍后就到
<10-1,ASSISTANT>The principal will be with you in just a moment.

175
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:47,950
<10-2,BECKETT>谢谢
<10-2,BECKETT>Thank you.

176
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:51,210
<10-3,BECKETT>卡塞尔  这都说不通啊
<10-3,BECKETT>Castle, none of this adds up.

177
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,960
<10-3,BECKETT>那两个女生在怕什么
<10-3,BECKETT>What were those girls so afraid of?

178
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,980
<10-3,BECKETT>食堂到底发生了什么事
<10-3,BECKETT>What happened in that cafeteria?

179
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:56,340
<10-4,CASTLE>我本该给出一个推论
<10-4,CASTLE>I'd offer a theory,

180
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,540
<10-4,CASTLE>但我在忙着回忆课后留校的时光
<10-4,CASTLE>but I'm too busy having detention flashbacks.

181
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,720
<10-5,BECKETT>你一定在这条过道上待过很长时间
<10-5,BECKETT>You must've spent a lot of time in this hallway.

182
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,220
<10-6,CASTLE>比在教室的时间还长
<10-6,CASTLE>More than I did in class.

183
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,960
<10-7,BECKETT>我赌那校长恨你
<10-7,BECKETT>I bet that principal hated you.

184
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,990
<10-8,CASTLE>"恨"这个字的程度好像还不够强烈
<10-8,CASTLE>I'm wondering if "Hate" is a strong-enough word.

185
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:10,020
<10-8,CASTLE>邓南校长雇了辆吊车才把奶牛从楼顶弄走
<10-8,CASTLE>Principal Dunnan had to hire a crane to get that cow off the roof.

186
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,310
<10-8,CASTLE>但我敢肯定那老牛已经退休了
<10-8,CASTLE>But I'm sure that old battle-ax has long since retired.

187
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,460
<10-8,CASTLE>放牧去了  打个比喻
<10-8,CASTLE>Put out to pasture, so to speak.

188
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:18,210
<10-9,PRINCIPAL DUNAN>是牛的比喻吗  罗杰斯先生
<10-9,PRINCIPAL DUNAN>Is that a bovine reference, Mr. Rodgers?

189
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:23,180
<10-10,CASTLE>邓南校长  您还在这
<10-10,CASTLE>Principal Dunnan, you're, uh...still here.

190
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:25,650
<10-11,DUNAN>遗憾的是  你回来了
<10-11,DUNAN>And, sadly, you have returned.

191
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:35,410
<11-1,DUNAN>我看到你成功地把自己从
<11-1,DUNAN>I see you have managed to extricate yourself

192
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:38,270
<11-1,DUNAN>不良少年的人生中解救出来了  罗杰斯先生
<11-1,DUNAN>from a life of delinquency, Mr. Rodgers,

193
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:41,090
<11-1,DUNAN>还变成了作家  不怎样的
<11-1,DUNAN>and become a writer... of sorts.

194
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,400
<11-3,CASTLE>事实上  现在是卡塞尔先生了
<11-3,CASTLE>Well, actually, it's, uh, Mr. Castle now.

195
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,440
<11-4,DUNAN>在我眼里你永远是罗杰斯
<11-4,DUNAN>You'll always be Rodgers to me.

196
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:50,010
<11-5,BECKETT>我们想问问你关于麦迪森·博蒙特的事
<11-5,BECKETT>Uh, we need to ask you a few questions about Madison Beaumont.

197
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,190
<11-6,DUNAN>真是件不幸的事
<11-6,DUNAN>It's a terrible business.

198
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:53,800
<11-6,DUNAN>对整个菲克罗夫特大家庭来说真是个悲剧
<11-6,DUNAN>It's a real tragedy for the entire Faircroft family.

199
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,010
<11-7,BECKETT>她的两个朋友  克丽丝·霍华德和希拉里·库珀
<11-7,BECKETT>Two of her friends, Kris Howard and Hillary Cooper,

200
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:58,180
<11-7,BECKETT>从视频通话中目击了凶案
<11-7,BECKETT>witnessed the murder over facetime,

201
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:01,070
<11-7,BECKETT>但她们不愿意说  我们想知道原因
<11-7,BECKETT>but they're not willing to talk. We need to know why.

202
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:03,410
<11-8,CASTLE>显然  这跟最近
<11-8,CASTLE>Apparently, it's related to something

203
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:05,820
<11-8,CASTLE>发生在食堂的事有关
<11-8,CASTLE>that happened in the cafeteria recently?

204
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,710
<11-9,BECKETT>邓南先生
<11-9,BECKETT>Mr. Dunnan?

205
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,770
<11-9,BECKETT>我可以说
<11-9,BECKETT>I'll tell you,

206
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:15,050
<11-10,DUNAN>但你们得答应不将其公之于众
<11-10,DUNAN>but you have to agree not to make any of this public.

207
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:17,190
<11-10,DUNAN>这会有损学校的声誉
<11-10,DUNAN>It will damage the school's reputation.

208
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:19,660
<11-11,BECKETT>我们是在调查谋杀案
<11-11,BECKETT>We are in the middle of a murder investigation.

209
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:22,440
<11-11,BECKETT>你没有谈条件的资格
<11-11,BECKETT>You're not exactly in the position to bargain here.

210
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,130
<11-12,DUNAN>好吧
<11-12,DUNAN>Very well.

211
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,430
<11-13,CASTLE>他竟然会用电脑
<11-13,CASTLE>I'm surprised he can use a computer.

212
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:32,000
<11-14,DUNAN>我是老了不是聋了  罗杰斯先生
<11-14,DUNAN>I am old, not deaf, Mr. Rodgers,

213
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,070
<11-14,DUNAN>而且高科技也难不倒我
<11-14,DUNAN>and undaunted by technology.

214
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,130
<11-14,DUNAN>两周前
<11-14,DUNAN>Two weeks ago,

215
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:38,780
<11-14,DUNAN>一个学生用手机拍下了整个事件
<11-14,DUNAN>a student captured this event on his cellphone.

216
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,250
<11-15,CASTLE>-事件  -没错
<11-15,CASTLE>- "Event"? - Yes.

217
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:44,170
<11-16,DUNAN>我删除了他手机上的视频
<11-16,DUNAN>I removed the video from his phone.

218
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,840
<11-16,DUNAN>因为在事情真相大白前
<11-16,DUNAN>I didn't want anyone to see it

219
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,310
<11-16,DUNAN>我还不想让其他人知道
<11-16,DUNAN>until the incident was fully understood.

220
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,230
<11-16,DUNAN>艾丽·比林斯
<11-16,DUNAN>Alli Billings?

221
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,130
<11-16,DUNAN>-辣  -确实
<11-16,DUNAN>- Hot. - So hot.

222
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:55,590
<11-16,DUNAN>-好吧  李琪·吉尔森呢  -少来了
<11-16,DUNAN>- All right, all right. Rikki Gelson? - No way!

223
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:56,770
<11-17,BECKETT>我觉得还行
<11-17,BECKETT>I'd still hit it!

224
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:58,170
<11-17,BECKETT>所谓的事件就是高中
<11-17,BECKETT>High-school guys playing "Hot-or-not" --

225
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,280
<11-18,DUNAN>-小男生给女生排名吗  -接着看
<11-18,DUNAN>- that's the event? - Just wait.

226
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:03,000
<11-17,BECKETT>乔丹·吉布斯觉得怎么样
<11-17,BECKETT>Okay, Jordan Gibbs -- hot or not?

227
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,960
<11-18,DUNAN>怎么搞的
<11-18,DUNAN>What?

228
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,710
<11-19,DUNAN>乔丹是个好学生
<11-19,DUNAN>Jordan is a good student,

229
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:09,410
<11-19,DUNAN>但是总受欺负
<11-19,DUNAN>but she's a bit of a black sheep.

230
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:11,870
<11-19,DUNAN>午饭吃什么  乔丹  油毡吗
<11-19,DUNAN>What's for lunch, Jordan -- linoleum?

231
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,100
<11-20,CASTLE>她总是被被害人及其朋友欺负
<11-20,CASTLE>And she's being bullied by our victim and her friends.

232
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,030
<11-21,DUNAN>接着看
<11-21,DUNAN>Keep watching.

235
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:36,790
<11-22,DUNAN>这  才是所谓的事件
<11-22,DUNAN>That... is the event.

236
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:38,700
<11-23,CASTLE>被排外
<11-23,CASTLE>The outcast...

237
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:40,390
<11-23,CASTLE>被坏女孩们欺负
<11-23,CASTLE>the mean girls,

238
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,780
<11-23,CASTLE>爆发的愤怒无意中触发了意念移物能力
<11-23,CASTLE>the rage that erupts in a telekinetic attack.

239
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:46,430
<11-23,CASTLE>简直是真实版的《魔女嘉莉》
<11-23,CASTLE>This is a real-life "Carrie."

249
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,710
<12-1,BECKETT>绝对是人为的恶作剧
<12-1,BECKETT>This has got to be a hoax.

250
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:05,620
<12-2,DUNAN>混乱一开始我就冲进了食堂
<12-2,DUNAN>I ran into the cafeteria as soon as the commotion started.

251
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,950
<12-2,DUNAN>现场乱作一团  即便是恶作剧
<12-2,DUNAN>The place was in shambles, but if it was a hoax,

252
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,390
<12-2,DUNAN>作恶者也没有留下证据
<12-2,DUNAN>the perpetrator left no evidence.

253
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:11,890
<12-3,BECKETT>我们需要备份一下视频用以研究
<12-3,BECKETT>Okay, well, we'll need a copy of this for analysis.

254
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:15,020
<12-3,BECKETT>-之前有类似的事发生过吗  -没有
<12-3,BECKETT>- Now, has anything like this happened before? - No.

255
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,660
<12-5,CASTLE>其实有的
<12-5,CASTLE>Um, yes --

256
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,200
<12-5,CASTLE>就在案发现场
<12-5,CASTLE>at the crime scene.

257
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,340
<12-5,CASTLE>这完美的解释了麦迪森头上的撞伤
<12-5,CASTLE>This explains Madison's head wound,

258
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,970
<12-5,CASTLE>还有横梁上的血迹
<12-5,CASTLE>the blood on the rafters.

259
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:24,780
<12-5,CASTLE>就是说乔丹用念力将她丢上了房梁
<12-5,CASTLE>Jordan threw her up there using the powers of her mind --

260
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,320
<12-5,CASTLE>也就是意念移物
<12-5,CASTLE>telekinesis.

261
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:30,540
<12-6,BECKETT>乔丹和麦迪森之前有过节吗
<12-6,BECKETT>Is there a history of trouble between Jordan and Madison?

262
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,770
<12-7,DUNAN>都是最近的事
<12-7,DUNAN>Not until recently.

263
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:32,580
<12-7,DUNAN>我听说
<12-7,DUNAN>I heard a rumor

264
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:35,060
<12-7,DUNAN>麦迪森和朋友们总是骚扰乔丹
<12-7,DUNAN>that Madison and her friends were harassing Jordan.

265
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,100
<12-7,DUNAN>于是找乔丹谈了谈
<12-7,DUNAN>I reached out to her,

266
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,690
<12-7,DUNAN>但她说想自己解决
<12-7,DUNAN>but she said she would prefer handling things herself.

267
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:40,590
<12-8,CASTLE>如果这就是她的解决办法
<12-8,CASTLE>Well, if this is how she handles things,

268
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:42,320
<12-8,CASTLE>克丽丝和希拉里会害怕也就在情理之中了
<12-8,CASTLE>no wonder Kris and Hillary are scared.

269
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,820
<12-9,BECKETT>我们得找乔丹谈谈
<12-9,BECKETT>We need to speak with Jordan.

270
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,610
<12-10,DUNAN>我去叫她
<12-10,DUNAN>I'll have her pulled from class.

271
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:49,480
<12-11,CASTLE>真想快点告诉史蒂芬这个案子
<12-11,CASTLE>Cannot wait to tell Stephen about this case.

272
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,130
<12-12,BECKETT>-谁  -史蒂芬·金[《魔女嘉莉》作者]  太难以置信了
<12-12,BECKETT>- Hmm? Stephen king. He won't believe it --

273
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:53,620
<12-13,CASTLE>真实版的《魔女嘉莉》
<12-13,CASTLE>a real-life Carrie.

274
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,820
<12-14,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我还不能肯定
<12-14,BECKETT>Castle, uh, I can't say

275
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,660
<12-14,BECKETT>食堂和麦迪森卧室究竟发生了什么
<12-14,BECKETT>what happened in the cafeteria or in Madison's bedroom yet.

276
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,750
<12-14,BECKETT>但有一点我能肯定
<12-14,BECKETT>But I can say this --

277
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,490
<12-14,BECKETT>这两个女孩之间的纠纷确实让
<12-14,BECKETT>the animosity between those two girls

278
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,860
<12-14,BECKETT>乔丹成为了案件重要的利害关系人
<12-14,BECKETT>is what makes Jordan a person of interest

279
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:06,010
<12-14,BECKETT>但绝非异能故事里的主人公
<12-14,BECKETT>and not your telekinetic fantasy.

280
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:09,690
<12-15,DUNAN>很抱歉  可是乔丹不见了
<12-15,DUNAN>I'm very sorry, but I'm afraid that Jordan is gone.

281
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,290
<12-16,BECKETT>什么叫不见了
<12-16,BECKETT>What do you mean she's gone?

282
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,730
<12-17,DUNAN>有学生说
<12-17,DUNAN>It seems a student in her class came in and told everyone

283
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:16,190
<12-17,DUNAN>警察来调查麦迪森的事
<12-17,DUNAN>the N.Y.P.D. was here asking about Madison.

284
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:19,000
<12-17,DUNAN>乔丹心烦意乱地离开了学校
<12-17,DUNAN>Jordan got very upset and left the campus.

285
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:21,200
<12-17,DUNAN>她的老师刚打来电话告诉我的
<12-17,DUNAN>Her teacher just called to inform us.

286
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,720
<12-17,DUNAN>乔丹还是不接电话
<12-17,DUNAN>Jordan's still not answering.

287
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,340
<12-17,DUNAN>只能接通留言箱
<12-17,DUNAN>It just keeps going right to voicemail.

288
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,880
<12-17,DUNAN>你确定她不在我那吗
<12-17,DUNAN>You sure she's not at my house?

289
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,400
<13-1,ESPOSITO>我的搭档去查看过了  她不在您家
<13-1,ESPOSITO>I sent my partner in to check. She wasn't there.

290
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:31,070
<13-1,ESPOSITO>帕朋夫人  乔丹有没有跟你提过
<13-1,ESPOSITO>Ms. Papen, did Jordan ever mention

291
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:32,700
<13-1,ESPOSITO>一个叫麦迪森·博蒙特的人
<13-1,ESPOSITO>a Madison Beaumont to you?

292
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,040
<13-1,ESPOSITO>我记忆中没有
<13-1,ESPOSITO>No, not that I can remember.

293
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,370
<13-2,ESPOSITO>-她昨天在家吗  -不在
<13-2,ESPOSITO>- Was she home last night? - No.

294
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,900
<13-2,ESPOSITO>她11点多才回来
<13-2,ESPOSITO>She was out till after 11:00.

295
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,030
<13-3,ESPOSITO>-去哪里了  -不知道
<13-3,ESPOSITO>- Out where? - I don't know.

296
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:45,190
<13-3,ESPOSITO>我哥哥和嫂子在车祸中去世了
<13-3,ESPOSITO>Look, my brother and his wife died in a car wreck,

297
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:46,360
<13-3,ESPOSITO>所以我收养了乔丹
<13-3,ESPOSITO>and I took Jordan in.

298
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,380
<13-4,ESPOSITO>我责无旁贷
<13-4,ESPOSITO>That's what you do.

299
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,920
<13-4,ESPOSITO>但我要兼两份工才能养活我俩
<13-4,ESPOSITO>But I have two jobs just to keep us afloat,

300
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,510
<13-4,ESPOSITO>我昨天8点多才到家  她不在
<13-4,ESPOSITO>and I wasn't home till 8:00, and she was gone.

301
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,730
<13-4,ESPOSITO>那她回来时看起来有什么异常吗
<13-4,ESPOSITO>How did she seem when she got home?

302
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,890
<24-15,RYAN>很安静  和平时一样
<24-15,RYAN>Quiet, as usual.

303
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:57,890
<24-16,CASTLE>我们不怎么说话
<24-16,CASTLE>We didn't talk much,

304
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:59,600
<24-17,BECKETT>她直接回她的屋里去了
<24-17,BECKETT>and then she just went straight to her room.

305
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,240
<13-5,RYAN>哈维
<13-5,RYAN>Hey, Javi...

306
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:02,900
<13-5,RYAN>过来一下行吗
<13-5,RYAN>Got a second?

307
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,990
<13-6,ESPOSITO>当然  失陪一下
<13-6,ESPOSITO>Yeah. Excuse me.

308
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:07,490
<17-7,BECKETT>警探
<17-7,BECKETT>Detective...

309
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:10,180
<13-3,ESPOSITO>我知道情况对乔丹十分不利
<13-3,ESPOSITO>I-I know what this looks like, but..

310
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,280
<13-4,ESPOSITO>但是乔丹真的是个好孩子
<13-4,ESPOSITO>Jordan is a really good kid.

311
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,090
<13-5,RYAN>她靠着自己挣来的奖学金
<13-5,RYAN>You know, she got a scholarship herself

312
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:16,570
<17-17,BECKETT>才进的这所高中
<17-17,BECKETT>to that fancy school, and, I mean,

313
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:19,030
<17-18,LUCAS>她不会轻易放弃这一切的
<17-18,LUCAS>She just -- she wouldn't throw that away, you know?

314
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,970
<17-18,LUCAS>她绝不会干这种事
<17-18,LUCAS>She -- she just wouldn't do this.

315
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:23,610
<14-1,HILLARY>绝对是乔丹干的
<14-1,HILLARY>Yeah. It was totally Jordan.

316
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:24,530
<14-2,KRIS>毋庸置疑
<14-2,KRIS>No doubt.

317
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,570
<14-3,BECKETT>你们并没有看到她
<14-3,BECKETT>But you never actually saw her.

318
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:28,520
<14-3,BECKETT>可是我们没看到任何人
<14-3,BECKETT>Well, we didn't see anyone.

319
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:30,200
<14-4,KRIS>就好像是什么隐形的力量
<14-4,KRIS>It was as if some invisible force

320
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,150
<14-4,KRIS>像丢洋娃娃似的把麦迪森丢来丢去
<14-4,KRIS>threw madison around the room like a rag doll.

321
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,190
<14-5,HILLARY>和乔丹在食堂
<14-5,HILLARY>The same way Jordan attacked

322
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:34,510
<14-5,HILLARY>-攻击我们时一模一样  -没错
<14-5,HILLARY>- us in the cafeteria. - Yeah.

323
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,860
<14-7,CASTLE>那是因为你们故意撞翻了她的盘子
<14-7,CASTLE>After you knocked into her as she carried a tray full of food.

324
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,870
<14-8,KRIS>我们知道欺负她不对  但...
<14-8,KRIS>Look, we know it was wrong of us to mess with her, but...

325
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,740
<14-9,HILLARY>她很古怪  你懂吗
<14-9,HILLARY>I mean, she's odd, you know?

326
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,760
<14-9,HILLARY>她对怪异的东西感兴趣
<14-9,HILLARY>She's into weird stuff.

327
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:50,910
<15-2,RYAN>-漫画书么  -乔丹房间里都是这些
<15-2,RYAN>- Comic books? - Yeah, I found them all over Jordan's room.

328
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,560
<15-3,ESPOSITO>小题大做  她或许就爱看X战警
<15-3,ESPOSITO>Big deal -- she's an X-men fan.

329
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,650
<15-4,RYAN>或许因为她也是变种人
<15-4,RYAN>Maybe 'cause she's one of them.

330
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:55,980
<15-4,RYAN>看看这些
<15-4,RYAN>Check it out.

334
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,730
<15-4,RYAN>还有这个
<15-4,RYAN>And then...there's this.

336
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,650
<15-5,ESPOSITO>得了吧  老兄  严肃点行吗
<15-5,ESPOSITO>Come on, bro. Let's be serious. Yeah?

337
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,450
<15-6,RYAN>你看这够严肃了吧
<15-6,RYAN>Is this serious enough for you?

338
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,250
<15-7,ESPOSITO>这是死者的照片
<15-7,ESPOSITO>That's our victim.

339
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:15,470
<15-8,RYAN>它就贴在乔丹书桌上方
<15-8,RYAN>I found it taped over Jordan's desk.

340
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:18,830
<16-1,ESPOSITO>她总是看这些书吗
<16-1,ESPOSITO>Was she always into this stuff?

341
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:21,620
<16-1,ESPOSITO>不  是几个礼拜前才开始的
<16-1,ESPOSITO>Uh, no. It started a few weeks ago.

342
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,510
<16-1,ESPOSITO>她问我提前要生活费
<16-1,ESPOSITO>She asked for an advance on her allowance

343
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:25,220
<16-2,ESPOSITO>去买了这些书
<16-2,ESPOSITO>and then went and bought all these books.

344
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,250
<16-2,ESPOSITO>怎么了
<16-2,ESPOSITO>Why?

345
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,350
<16-2,ESPOSITO>乔丹的朋友呢
<16-2,ESPOSITO>What about Jordan's friends?

346
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:29,620
<16-2,ESPOSITO>他们会知道她在哪儿吗
<16-2,ESPOSITO>Would they know where she is?

347
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,170
<16-2,ESPOSITO>她的朋友不多
<16-2,ESPOSITO>She doesn't have a lot of friends.

348
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:33,430
<16-3,RYAN>多数时候她都对着电脑
<16-3,RYAN>She spends most of her time in front of her computer.

349
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:34,840
<16-3,RYAN>你介意看我们看一下她的电脑吗
<16-3,RYAN>Do you mind if we take a look at it?

350
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,420
<16-3,RYAN>这有助于找出她的去向
<16-3,RYAN>It might help us find out where she went.

351
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:37,370
<16-3,RYAN>不介意
<16-3,RYAN>No, that's fine.

352
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,130
<16-4,ESPOSITO>在她这样十几岁的年纪
<16-4,ESPOSITO>Well, she's a teenage girl.

353
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:40,830
<16-4,ESPOSITO>肯定会有一起玩的小伙伴
<16-4,ESPOSITO>There's got to be somebody that she's hanging with.

354
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:42,890
<16-4,ESPOSITO>是有个男孩偶尔会来
<16-4,ESPOSITO>Well, there's one boy that comes around now and then.

355
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:45,430
<16-4,ESPOSITO>乔丹生病的时候给她拿来了作业
<16-4,ESPOSITO>He brought Jordan's homework to the house when she was sick.

356
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,970
<16-4,ESPOSITO>名字叫卢卡斯
<16-4,ESPOSITO>His name is Lucas.

357
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:51,520
<17-1,BECKETT>卢卡斯·特洛伊  他就在那儿
<17-1,BECKETT>Lucas Troy. And there he is.

358
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,390
<17-2,CASTLE>"星空骑士"  冬季舞会
<17-2,CASTLE>Ah, "A Starry Knight" -- The Winter Ball.

359
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,380
<17-2,CASTLE>我告诉过你邓南校长是在毕业舞会前开除我的吗
<17-2,CASTLE>Did I tell you principal Dunnan expelled me just before prom?

360
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,860
<17-3,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你居然没能参加自己的毕业舞会
<17-3,BECKETT>Castle, no! You didn't get to go to your own prom?

361
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,990
<17-4,CASTLE>我的舞伴原本是奥德拉·道伯森
<17-4,CASTLE>And my date would've been Audra Dobson --

362
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:04,920
<17-4,CASTLE>超级火辣
<17-4,CASTLE>So unbelievably hot.

363
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:08,130
<17-5,BECKETT>如果能给你点安慰的话  我也错过了舞会
<17-5,BECKETT>Well, if it's any consolation, I missed my prom as well.

364
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:09,690
<17-6,CASTLE>真的吗  为什么
<17-6,CASTLE>Really? Why?

365
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,630
<17-6,CASTLE>卢卡斯·特洛伊吗
<17-6,CASTLE>Lucas Troy?

366
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,250
<17-7,BECKETT>你好  我是凯特·贝克特警探
<17-7,BECKETT>Hi. I'm detective Kate Beckett.

367
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,040
<17-7,BECKETT>他是我同事  理查德·卡塞尔
<17-7,BECKETT>This is my colleague, Richard Castle.

368
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,200
<17-7,BECKETT>-有时间谈谈吗  -有啊  不好意思
<17-7,BECKETT>- Do you have a minute? - Yeah. Ye-- s-sorry.

369
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,190
<17-8,LUCAS TROY>我只是想在明天舞会前把这个弄完
<17-8,LUCAS TROY>I'm just trying to get this done for tomorrow's dance.

370
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:22,420
<17-8,LUCAS TROY>整个礼拜我都在忙这事儿
<17-8,LUCAS TROY>I've been at it all week.

371
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,040
<17-8,LUCAS TROY>现在我的肺里面
<17-8,LUCAS TROY>At this point, the inside of my lungs

372
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,280
<17-8,LUCAS TROY>可能都是天蓝色的了
<17-8,LUCAS TROY>are probably cerulean blue.

373
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:27,460
<17-9,CASTLE>真奇怪他们怎么没有延迟舞会
<17-9,CASTLE>I'm surprised they're not postponing the dance.

374
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:30,240
<17-10,LUCAS>麦迪森的父母坚持如期举行舞会来纪念她
<17-10,LUCAS>Madison's parents are insisting it go on in her memory.

375
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,520
<17-10,LUCAS>真是神奇  即使她已经死了
<17-10,LUCAS>It's amazing -- even after she's dead,

376
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,910
<17-10,LUCAS>所有话题还是围着她转
<17-10,LUCAS>everything's still all about her.

377
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:35,430
<17-11,BECKETT>很明显你不喜欢她
<17-11,BECKETT>Obviously, you're not a fan.

378
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,240
<17-12,LUCAS>我不喜欢她对待别人的方式
<17-12,LUCAS>I didn't like how she treated people.

379
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:38,450
<17-13,CASTLE>是指乔丹·吉布斯吗
<17-13,CASTLE>People like Jordan Gibbs?

380
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:41,620
<17-14,LUCAS>对  但乔丹不可能报复的
<17-14,LUCAS>Yeah, but there's no way Jordan would retaliate.

381
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:43,450
<17-14,LUCAS>她不会对任何人动手
<17-14,LUCAS>The girl wouldn't raise her hand to anyone.

382
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:44,850
<17-14,LUCAS>她没必要动"手"
<17-14,LUCAS>She didn't have to,

383
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,300
<17-15,CASTLE>要是她能隔空移物的话
<17-15,CASTLE>not when she has flying chairs in her arsenal.

384
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:48,620
<17-16,LUCAS>我听到传言了
<17-16,LUCAS>I heard the rumors.

385
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,700
<17-16,LUCAS>虽然我当时不在食堂
<17-16,LUCAS>I wasn't there in the cafeteria,

386
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:52,240
<17-16,LUCAS>但我肯定那不是她干的
<17-16,LUCAS>but I'm sure she had nothing to do with that.

387
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,680
<17-17,BECKETT>你今天早上第一节课是和她一起上的
<17-17,BECKETT>No, but you were in her first-period class this morning.

388
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,720
<17-17,BECKETT>你知道她去哪儿了吗
<17-17,BECKETT>Do you know where she went?

389
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,960
<17-18,LUCAS>她什么也没对我说  就这么走了
<17-18,LUCAS>She didn't say a word to me. She just -- she just took off.

390
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,900
<17-19,BECKETT>卢卡斯  我们跟你老师谈过
<17-19,BECKETT>Lucas, we spoke with your teacher.

391
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,200
<17-19,BECKETT>她说乔丹走后你马上也走了
<17-19,BECKETT>She said that you left right after Jordan did.

392
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,430
<17-19,BECKETT>你离开了15分钟  是去哪儿了
<17-19,BECKETT>You were gone for 15 minutes. Where'd you go?

393
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:09,440
<17-20,LUCAS>我看得出来她很不安
<17-20,LUCAS>I-I could see she was really upset,

394
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,970
<17-20,LUCAS>我只是想看看她好不好
<17-20,LUCAS>so I just wanted to see if she was okay.

395
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:12,370
<17-20,LUCAS>所以我就跟着她...
<17-20,LUCAS>So I went after her...

396
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:17,560
<17-20,LUCAS>但在4/5/6号线86街地铁站  我跟丢了
<17-20,LUCAS>but I lost her, uh, at the 4/5/6 subway station on 86th.

397
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:20,790
<18-1,TECH AGENT TORI>我们先来看看食堂录像
<18-1,TECH AGENT TORI>Okay, so, let's start with the cafeteria video.

398
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,430
<18-1,TECH AGENT TORI>看不出乔丹·吉布斯或其他人
<18-1,TECH AGENT TORI>There's no indication that Jordan Gibbs or anyone else

399
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:25,690
<18-1,TECH AGENT TORI>移动桌椅的迹象
<18-1,TECH AGENT TORI>is moving the tables and chairs.

400
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:28,900
<18-1,TECH AGENT TORI>坦白说  我也解释不了
<18-1,TECH AGENT TORI>Frankly, I can't explain what we're seeing here.

401
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:31,760
<18-2,CASTLE>我想我能给你们解释解释
<18-2,CASTLE>Well, I think I can offer an explanation.

402
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,220
<18-3,BECKETT>那通她打给朋友的视频电话呢
<18-3,BECKETT>Uh, what about the FaceTime call made to Madison's friends?

403
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:35,630
<18-3,BECKETT>有办法拿到视频吗
<18-3,BECKETT>Is there any way to retrieve that?

404
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:37,160
<18-4,TORI>视频电话就像电话一样
<18-4,TORI>A video call is like a phone call.

405
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,210
<18-4,TORI>如果没有人录下来
<18-4,TORI>Unless someone's recording it,

406
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:40,210
<18-4,TORI>电话挂断  数据也就没了
<18-4,TORI>once the call ends, the data is gone.

407
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:43,660
<18-4,TORI>至于乔丹的电脑嘛  搜索历史显示
<18-4,TORI>As for Jordan's laptop, browser history suggests

408
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:46,380
<18-4,TORI>最近两个礼拜  她花了很长时间
<18-4,TORI>she spent hours obsessing on all things telekinesis,

409
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,630
<18-4,TORI>研究意念移物
<18-4,TORI>starting two weeks ago.

410
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:48,680
<18-5,CASTLE>正好是在
<18-5,CASTLE>Right about the time

411
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,300
<18-5,CASTLE>她用意念砸了食堂之后
<18-5,CASTLE>she telekinetically rearranged the cafeteria.

412
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,880
<18-5,CASTLE>很显然  乔丹意识到自己有某些超能力
<18-5,CASTLE>Clearly, Jordan realized she had powers

413
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,430
<18-5,CASTLE>想要理解它们
<18-5,CASTLE>and was trying to understand them.

414
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,220
<18-5,CASTLE>这和《魔女嘉莉》惊人地相似啊
<18-5,CASTLE>This is exactly like the movie "Carrie."

415
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,120
<18-6,BECKETT>对  和电影惊人地相似  因为都是虚构的
<18-6,BECKETT>Yes, exactly like the movie -- fictional.

416
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,870
<18-6,BECKETT>乔丹没有什么超能力
<18-6,BECKETT>Jordan doesn't have powers.

417
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:03,470
<18-7,ESPOSITO>拿到了乔丹的通话记录
<18-7,ESPOSITO>Got Jordan's phone records.

418
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:05,290
<18-7,ESPOSITO>通信服务供应商说她的手机关机了
<18-7,ESPOSITO>Her service provider says that her phone's been turned off,

419
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:07,500
<18-7,ESPOSITO>但她离开学校的时候打了个电话
<18-7,ESPOSITO>but she made one call right when she ditched school.

420
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,350
<18-9,ESPOSITO>-打给谁  -号码属于一家叫亨德森诊断所的地方
<18-9,ESPOSITO>- To who? - Number's listed to a Henderson Diagnostics,

421
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:12,510
<18-9,ESPOSITO>但我找不到他们到底是做什么的
<18-9,ESPOSITO>And I can't find any info on what they do, exactly.

422
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:14,500
<18-9,ESPOSITO>打电话过去也没人接
<18-9,ESPOSITO>But when I called, there was no answer,

423
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,020
<18-9,ESPOSITO>也没有语音留言和短信
<18-9,ESPOSITO>no voicemail or message, either.

424
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:19,970
<18-11,ESPOSITO>-你有拿到地址吗  -是的  布鲁克林  4/5号线那站
<18-11,ESPOSITO>- Did you get an address? - Uh, yeah -- Brooklyn, off the 4/5 line.

425
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:24,080
<19-1,BECKETT>乔丹来这个地方干什么
<19-1,BECKETT>What was Jordan doing all the way out here?

426
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,180
<19-1,BECKETT>这里离她的家还有学校都很远
<19-1,BECKETT>I mean, it's miles away from her house, the school, uh --

427
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,560
<19-2,CASTLE>没人知道乔丹有任何朋友
<19-2,CASTLE>Just because nobody knows who Jordan's friends are.

428
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,900
<19-2,CASTLE>并不代表她真的没有任何朋友
<19-2,CASTLE>Doesn't mean she doesn't have any.

429
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:32,230
<19-3,BECKETT>她朋友都会来这种地方玩吗
<19-3,BECKETT>And her friends hang out in a place like this?

430
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,070
<19-4,NERDY GUY>你好
<19-4,NERDY GUY>Hi.

431
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,100
<19-5,BECKETT>纽约警察  我要问你几个问题
<19-5,BECKETT>NYPD. I'd like to ask you a few que--

432
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,730
<19-6,NERDY GUY>你一定是为博士而来
<19-6,NERDY GUY>Y-you must be here for the doctor.

433
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:42,680
<19-6,NERDY GUY>他正在上课
<19-6,NERDY GUY>He's in session now.

434
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,670
<19-6,NERDY GUY>跟着我走
<19-6,NERDY GUY>Follow me.

435
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,430
<20-1,BECKETT>打扰一下  纽约警察
<20-1,BECKETT>Excuse me. NYPD.

436
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:51,890
<20-1,BECKETT>我们来寻
<20-1,BECKETT>We're looking...

437
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:54,710
<20-2,BECKETT>找
<20-2,BECKETT>for...

438
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:01,190
<20-3,CASTLE>我想我们找对地方了
<20-3,CASTLE>I think we're in the right place.

439
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:09,720
<20-3,CASTLE>-你是怎么做到的  -精神专注的力量
<20-3,CASTLE>- How did you do that? - The power of a focused mind.

440
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:11,750
<21-1,CASTLE>是嘛  我在拉斯维加斯看到过这种把戏
<21-1,CASTLE>Yeah, I saw that trick in Vegas.

441
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,260
<21-2,BECKETT>你是谁  这是个什么地方
<21-2,BECKETT>So, who are you? What is this place?

442
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:17,010
<21-3,RAMPINEL>我是拉姆帕纳尔博士
<21-3,RAMPINEL>I am Dr. Rampanel.

443
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:18,630
<21-3,RAMPINEL>这个地方是我的实验室
<21-3,RAMPINEL>And this place is my lab,

444
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:20,730
<21-3,RAMPINEL>而且我所做的并不是魔术
<21-3,RAMPINEL>and what I do is not magic.

445
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:21,970
<21-4,BECKETT>那么到底是什么呢
<21-4,BECKETT>So, then, what is it?

446
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:24,270
<21-5,RAMPINEL>我在麻省理工学院教生物物理学
<21-5,RAMPINEL>I teach biophysics at M.I.T.

447
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,040
<21-5,RAMPINEL>我从亨德森那租下这个地方
<21-5,RAMPINEL>I rent this space from Henderson

448
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,540
<21-5,RAMPINEL>来开展我在意念移物方面的研究
<21-5,RAMPINEL>to conduct my research in telekinesis.

449
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:30,430
<21-6,CASTLE>你研究意念移物吗
<21-6,CASTLE>You study telekinesis?

450
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:33,160
<21-7,RAMPINEL>我教人们如何激发出他们的潜能
<21-7,RAMPINEL>I teach people how to unlock their potential.

451
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,540
<21-8,BECKETT>我猜是收费的
<21-8,BECKETT>For a fee, I'm guessing.

452
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:35,460
<21-8,BECKETT>如果他们付得够多
<21-8,BECKETT>If they pay you enough,

453
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:36,980
<21-8,BECKETT>你会让他们相信自己是特别的
<21-8,BECKETT>you make them believe they're special.

454
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,260
<21-9,RAMPINEL>我看出来你是个怀疑者
<21-9,RAMPINEL>I see you're a skeptic.

455
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,290
<21-9,RAMPINEL>大多数没有天赋的人都是如此
<21-9,RAMPINEL>Most ungifted are.

456
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,360
<21-10,BECKETT>你怎么看乔丹·吉布斯
<21-10,BECKETT>What can you tell us about Jordan Gibbs?

457
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,350
<21-11,RAMPINEL>对了  乔丹
<21-11,RAMPINEL>Ah, yes. Jordan.

458
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:50,100
<21-11,RAMPINEL>我记得她上周过来给自己做评估
<21-11,RAMPINEL>She came by last week, I think, to have herself evaluated.

459
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,420
<21-12,CASTLE>她做得怎么样  让我猜猜看
<21-12,CASTLE>How did she do? Uh, let me guess --

460
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,040
<21-12,CASTLE>太出色了
<21-12,CASTLE>Off the charts.

461
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,490
<21-13,RAMPINEL>我真的不能讨论我的研究结果
<21-13,RAMPINEL>I really can't discuss my findings.

462
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,440
<21-14,BECKETT>上周吗
<21-14,BECKETT>Last week?

463
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,850
<21-14,BECKETT>但是她今早往这里打过电话
<21-14,BECKETT>But she called here this morning.

464
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:03,490
<21-15,RAMPINEL>事实上  她确实打过电话
<21-15,RAMPINEL>In fact, she did, yes.

465
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:05,690
<21-16,CASTLE>她说了些什么
<21-16,CASTLE>And... what did she say?

466
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:07,010
<21-17,RAMPINEL>她很害怕
<21-17,RAMPINEL>Uh, she was frightened.

467
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:10,270
<21-17,RAMPINEL>乔丹还不知道如何控制自己的能力
<21-17,RAMPINEL>You see, Jordan doesn't yet know how to control her powers.

468
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:11,850
<21-18,BECKETT>她有来见你吗
<21-18,BECKETT>So, did she come here to see you?

469
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:14,250
<21-19,RAMPINEL>是的  但她现在已经走了
<21-19,RAMPINEL>Yes. But she's gone now.

470
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:16,330
<21-20,BECKETT>你在撒谎
<21-20,BECKETT>You're lying.

471
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:18,610
<21-20,BECKETT>如果你不说实话的话
<21-20,BECKETT>And if you don't tell me the truth,

472
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:20,780
<21-20,BECKETT>我会以妨碍司法公正罪
<21-20,BECKETT>I will arrest you for obstruction.

473
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:22,240
<21-20,BECKETT>-和窝藏嫌犯罪逮捕你  -别说了
<21-20,BECKETT>- and harboring a fugitive  - Stop.

474
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,060
<21-22,JORDAN>别逼他了
<21-22,JORDAN>Leave him alone.

475
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,990
<21-22,JORDAN>他只是想保护我
<21-22,JORDAN>He's just trying to protect me.

476
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,900
<22-1,RYAN>她甚至长得就有点像魔女嘉莉
<22-1,RYAN>She even kind of looks like Carrie.

477
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,480
<22-2,ESPOSITO>才不是
<22-2,ESPOSITO>No, she does not!

478
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,100
<22-2,ESPOSITO>再说了  这么个瘦小女生怎么能
<22-2,ESPOSITO>Besides, how would that little, skinny girl

479
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,680
<22-2,ESPOSITO>把麦迪森扔到天花板上
<22-2,ESPOSITO>throw Madison up against the ceiling?

480
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,240
<22-3,CASTLE>借助于我们还无法理解的能力
<22-3,CASTLE>With powers we have yet to comprehend.

481
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:43,750
<22-3,CASTLE>在里面小心点  别惹她生气
<22-3,CASTLE>Be careful in there. Don't anger her.

482
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:45,540
<22-3,CASTLE>我们不知道她有多大的能力
<22-3,CASTLE>We don't know what she's capable of.

483
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:46,790
<22-3,CASTLE>你说得对
<22-3,CASTLE>You're right.

484
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,600
<22-4,BECKETT>你或许应该跟我一块进去
<22-4,BECKETT>You should probably go in there with me...

485
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,360
<22-4,BECKETT>保护我
<22-4,BECKETT>For protection.

486
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:56,900
<23-1,BECKETT>找你找得好辛苦啊  乔丹
<23-1,BECKETT>You're a hard girl to find, Jordan.

487
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:01,190
<23-2,JORDAN>我必须要离菲克罗夫特远点
<23-2,JORDAN>I had to get away from Faircroft.

488
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,690
<23-2,JORDAN>每个人都在私下谈论说
<23-2,JORDAN>Everyone was whispering about

489
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:04,850
<23-2,JORDAN>我是杀害麦迪森的罪魁祸首
<23-2,JORDAN>how I was the one who killed Madison.

490
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,730
<23-3,BECKETT>他们为什么要这么说
<23-3,BECKETT>And why would they say that?

491
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,970
<23-4,CASTLE>是因为麦迪森是你的死敌吗
<23-4,CASTLE>Is it because Madison was your nemesis?

492
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:14,070
<23-4,CASTLE>她以前并不是
<23-4,CASTLE>She didn't used to be.

493
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,450
<23-5,JORDAN>很长一段时间
<23-5,JORDAN>For the longest time,

494
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:20,330
<23-5,JORDAN>我都被麦迪森和她的小团体所无视
<23-5,JORDAN>I was invisible to Madison and her bitch clique...

495
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,580
<23-5,JORDAN>就像我被大部分人所无视一样
<23-5,JORDAN>Just like I am to most people.

496
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,020
<23-5,JORDAN>然后  上个月
<23-5,JORDAN>And then, last month,

497
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:28,390
<23-5,JORDAN>放完寒假回来的第一个早上
<23-5,JORDAN>first morning back after winter break,

498
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:30,580
<23-5,JORDAN>我在图书馆里读书
<23-5,JORDAN>I was in the library reading,

499
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:33,400
<23-5,JORDAN>然后我偶然在俄国文学区碰到她
<23-5,JORDAN>and I ran into her in the Russian lit section.

500
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,660
<23-5,JORDAN>她接着就大发雷霆
<23-5,JORDAN>And she got all pissed,

501
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,540
<23-5,JORDAN>说我不能告诉任何人我在那里见过她
<23-5,JORDAN>Saying I couldn't tell anyone that I'd seen her there.

502
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:39,070
<23-6,CASTLE>-她为什么生气  -我完全不知道
<23-6,CASTLE>- What was she angry about? - I have no idea.

503
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:40,910
<23-7,JORDAN>也许她不想让任何人知道
<23-7,JORDAN>Maybe she didn't want anyone to know

504
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:42,540
<23-7,JORDAN>她还是会学习的
<23-7,JORDAN>that she actually studies.

505
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:46,980
<23-7,JORDAN>但是  那天晚些时候  麦迪森就开始针对我
<23-7,JORDAN>But then, later that day, Madison started messing with me,

506
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,480
<23-7,JORDAN>从此就一发不可收拾了
<23-7,JORDAN>and it just got worse from there.

507
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,440
<23-8,BECKETT>所以你在食堂演了那出闹剧
<23-8,BECKETT>So you pulled that stunt in the cafeteria

508
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:51,800
<23-8,BECKETT>想让她对你有所畏惧
<23-8,BECKETT>to make her scared of you.

509
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,620
<23-9,JORDAN>我只是想制止他们的行为
<23-9,JORDAN>I just wanted them to stop!

510
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,460
<23-10,BECKETT>这就是你杀麦迪森的原因吗
<23-10,BECKETT>Is that why you killed Madison?

511
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,640
<23-11,JORDAN>我猜是吧  我不知道
<23-11,JORDAN>I guess so! I-I don't know!

512
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,990
<23-12,JORDAN>这是我紧张时的习惯动作
<23-12,JORDAN>It's a nervous habit.

513
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,640
<23-13,BECKETT>乔丹  不能猜来猜去
<23-13,BECKETT>Jordan, there's no guessing here.

514
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,020
<23-13,BECKETT>你要么是杀了麦迪森要么没杀
<23-13,BECKETT>Either you did or you didn't kill Madison.

515
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,980
<23-14,JORDAN>我很生气
<23-14,JORDAN>I got so angry...

516
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:25,560
<23-14,JORDAN>然后东西就开始在食堂到处乱飞
<23-14,JORDAN>and stuff just started flying around the cafeteria.

517
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,630
<23-14,JORDAN>然后我希望麦迪森去死
<23-14,JORDAN>And then I wished for Madison to be dead,

518
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:29,410
<23-14,JORDAN>我再听到她的消息时  她真的就死了
<23-14,JORDAN>And the next thing I knew, she was!

519
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,120
<23-14,JORDAN>这一定是我做的  对吧
<23-14,JORDAN>It had to be me, right?

520
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,060
<23-15,BECKETT>你昨晚八点到十点在哪里
<23-15,BECKETT>Where were you between 8:00 and 10:00 P.M. last night?

521
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,480
<23-16,JORDAN>我在阿斯托利亚的露露咖啡厅学习
<23-16,JORDAN>I was studying at Lulu's Cafe in Astoria.

522
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:43,250
<24-1,ESPOSITO>我们得放她走
<24-1,ESPOSITO>We're gonna have to kick her loose.

523
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,960
<24-1,ESPOSITO>服务生确定乔丹在11点之前一直在
<24-1,ESPOSITO>Waitress confirmed that Jordan was at the cafe

524
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,940
<24-1,ESPOSITO>皇后区的咖啡厅里
<24-1,ESPOSITO>in Queens till 11:00.

525
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,600
<24-2,BECKETT>那她是不可能杀害麦迪森的
<24-2,BECKETT>So she couldn't have killed madison.

526
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:49,830
<24-3,CASTLE>不是仅凭她的双手
<24-3,CASTLE>Not with her bare hands,

527
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:52,650
<24-3,CASTLE>可谁知道她的隔空取物能力能伸展多远
<24-3,CASTLE>but who knows how far her secret telekinetic powers might reach?

528
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,820
<24-4,RYAN>事实上
<24-4,RYAN>Well, it turns out our victim

529
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,400
<24-4,RYAN>被害人也有着她自己的小秘密
<24-4,RYAN>might've had some secrets of her own.

530
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,060
<24-5,BECKETT>你找到了她是在和谁约会吗
<24-5,BECKETT>Did you track down whoever Madison was seeing?

531
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:00,090
<24-6,RYAN>据我所知  她没有在和任何人约会
<24-6,RYAN>As far as I can tell, she wasn't seeing anybody.

532
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:02,350
<24-6,RYAN>不过  这里是她的财务报告
<24-6,RYAN>But these are her financials.

533
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:04,260
<24-7,ESPOSITO>什么样的高中生会有财务报告
<24-7,ESPOSITO>What kind of high-school kid has financials?

534
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,270
<24-8,RYAN>麦迪森有
<24-8,RYAN>Madison does.

535
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:07,250
<24-8,RYAN>她有一堆信用卡
<24-8,RYAN>She had a dozen credit cards,

536
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,820
<24-8,RYAN>她把它们都刷爆了
<24-8,RYAN>and she was wearing them out

537
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:11,030
<24-8,RYAN>爱马仕手袋  周仰杰鞋子
<24-8,RYAN>Hermes handbags, Jimmy Choos.

538
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:13,270
<24-8,RYAN>这可是几万美金的东西
<24-8,RYAN>I'm talking tens of thousands of dollars.

539
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:14,800
<24-9,ESPOSITO>那又怎样  他父母很有钱
<24-9,ESPOSITO>So what? Her parents were loaded.

540
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:17,580
<24-10,RYAN>是啊  不过她父母可没帮她支付那些
<24-10,RYAN>Yeah, but mommy and daddy weren't springing for any of this stuff.

541
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,980
<24-10,RYAN>这些卡都是在麦迪森的名下
<24-10,RYAN>The cards were in Madison's name,

542
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:21,500
<24-10,RYAN>每月都用她的秘密银行账户付清欠款
<24-10,RYAN>paid off every month through her own secret bank account.

543
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,120
<24-11,BECKETT>那她这些钱都是哪里来的
<24-11,BECKETT>So where was this money coming from?

544
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,450
<24-12,RYAN>这也是我们正在调查的
<24-12,RYAN>That's what we're trying to figure out.

545
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,010
<24-12,RYAN>另外  还有一长串信用卡记录
<24-12,RYAN>Plus, there's more -- a slew of credit-card charges

546
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:29,910
<24-12,RYAN>半夜叫的出租车和便利店消费
<24-12,RYAN>for late-night cab rides and convenience-store purchases.

547
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:31,600
<24-13,CASTLE>这个倒是和麦迪森前男友的描述吻合
<24-13,CASTLE>Well, and that fits with what Madison's ex-boyfriend said

548
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,910
<24-13,CASTLE>说她经常半夜出去夜不归宿
<24-13,CASTLE>about her staying out to all hours.

549
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:35,330
<24-14,BECKETT>也许她只是出去玩  泡泡夜店什么的
<24-14,BECKETT>Okay, maybe she was going out, hitting the clubs.

550
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:36,770
<24-15,RYAN>是啊  不过  这些都是工作日夜晚
<24-15,RYAN>Yeah, but on weeknights?

551
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:38,580
<24-15,RYAN>而且这里没有酒吧或者夜店的记录
<24-15,RYAN>And there are no bar or club charges here.

552
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,680
<24-16,CASTLE>看看这个
<24-16,CASTLE>And look at this.

553
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,270
<24-16,CASTLE>记得乔丹和麦迪森的矛盾是怎么来的吗
<24-16,CASTLE>Remember how Jordan said her troubles with Madison began

554
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:45,200
<24-16,CASTLE>刚开学那会儿她俩在图书馆撞见
<24-16,CASTLE>when school started back up with that run-in at the library?

555
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,450
<24-16,CASTLE>根据这项出租车记录
<24-16,CASTLE>According to this taxi charge,

556
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:49,570
<24-16,CASTLE>麦迪森那天早上5点就在外面了
<24-16,CASTLE>Madison was out and about that same morning at 5:00 a.m.

557
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:52,020
<24-17,BECKETT>那说明她活动结束之后直接去了学校
<24-17,BECKETT>Okay, so, she was going straight to school from wherever she was.

558
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,300
<24-17,BECKETT>可是她为什么要整晚都在外面
<24-17,BECKETT>But why would she stay out all night

559
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,890
<24-17,BECKETT>然后去学校的图书馆
<24-17,BECKETT>and then go to the school library?

560
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:58,080
<24-18,CASTLE>她在做什么她不想让乔丹知道的事情
<24-18,CASTLE>What was she doing she didn't want Jordan to know about?

561
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:01,570
<25-1,LIBRARIAN>学生们通过刷卡来进出图书馆
<25-1,LIBRARIAN>Students use their I.D.s to swipe in and out of the library.

562
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,670
<25-1,LIBRARIAN>这是麦迪森·博蒙特整个学年
<25-1,LIBRARIAN>These are all the times Madison Beaumont

563
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:06,240
<25-1,LIBRARIAN>进出图书馆的记录
<25-1,LIBRARIAN>entered and exited during this entire school year.

564
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,420
<25-2,CASTLE>谢谢
<25-2,CASTLE>Thank you.

565
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,590
<25-3,BECKETT>每次麦迪森大清早去图书馆
<25-3,BECKETT>Okay, so, each one of Madison's early-morning visits

566
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:13,440
<25-3,BECKETT>都是在她在外面通宵之后
<25-3,BECKETT>to the library happened after one of her all-nighters.

567
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,110
<25-3,BECKETT>她进来之后五分钟就出去了
<25-3,BECKETT>She swiped in and out within 5 minutes.

568
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:18,830
<25-4,CASTLE>我猜她在俄国文学区这里晃可不是要学习
<25-4,CASTLE>I'm guessing she wasn't hanging out in russian lit to study.

569
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:21,540
<25-5,BECKETT>卡塞尔  俄国文学  就在这儿
<25-5,BECKETT>Castle, russian literature -- it's right here.

570
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,220
<25-6,CASTLE>多谢Kindle
<25-6,CASTLE>Thank god for the kindle,

571
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:25,220
<25-6,CASTLE>不然我没过几年就要失业了
<25-6,CASTLE>or I'd be out of a job in a couple of years.

572
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:27,580
<25-6,CASTLE>现在的孩子根本不看实体书了
<25-6,CASTLE>Kids just don't read actual books anymore.

573
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,740
<25-7,BECKETT>除非是《Voyna I mir》
<25-7,BECKETT>Unless it's "Voyna I mir" --

574
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,680
<25-7,BECKETT>《战争与和平》  俄文原版  瞧
<25-7,BECKETT>"War and peace," In its original russian. And look

575
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,630
<25-7,BECKETT>这片没有灰尘
<25-7,BECKETT>-- there's no dust here.

576
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:38,610
<25-7,BECKETT>看来最近有人把这本书拿出来过
<25-7,BECKETT>It's like someone pulled this out recently.

577
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:41,580
<25-7,BECKETT>这本书比我印象中的要轻
<25-7,BECKETT>And it's lighter than I remember Tolstoy being.

578
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:48,730
<25-8,BECKETT>这些是银行券吗
<25-8,BECKETT>Are these bank notes?

579
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,880
<25-9,CASTLE>这些是债券
<25-9,CASTLE>These are bonds.

580
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:52,940
<25-9,CASTLE>是无记名债券  德国政府发行的
<25-9,CASTLE>These are bearer bonds, issued by the German government.

581
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,670
<25-9,CASTLE>这些都是见票即可支付给持票人
<25-9,CASTLE>These are payable to the bearer,

582
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:55,770
<25-9,CASTLE>不会有任何验证
<25-9,CASTLE>no questions asked.

583
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:56,700
<25-9,CASTLE>德国无记名债券
<25-9,CASTLE>German bearer bonds?

584
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,960
<25-10,BECKETT>我以为这些只在《虎胆龙威》里有
<25-10,BECKETT>I thought that only existed in "Die Hard."

585
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,050
<25-11,CASTLE>麦迪森是怎么搞到这种东西的
<25-11,CASTLE>How did Madison get her hands on these?

586
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:04,660
<25-12,BECKETT>不知道  可这里价值超过一百万美元
<25-12,BECKETT>I don't know, but there's over a million dollars' worth here.

587
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,520
<25-12,BECKETT>肯定是哪里搞错了
<25-12,BECKETT>No, there must be some mistake.

588
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,110
<25-12,BECKETT>也许她是申请了几张信用卡
<25-12,BECKETT>She may have applied for some credit cards,

589
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:15,040
<25-12,BECKETT>不过麦迪森不可能有如此多现金在银行里
<25-12,BECKETT>but there's no way Madison had a bank account with this much cash in it.

590
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:17,300
<26-1,RYAN>没有搞错  博蒙特先生
<26-1,RYAN>There's no mistake, Mr. Beaumont.

591
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,980
<26-1,RYAN>这些钱也只是冰山的一角
<26-1,RYAN>And this money is just the tip of the iceberg.

592
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,190
<26-2,ESPOSITO>除了疯狂大血拼之外
<26-2,ESPOSITO>Well, aside from the shopping sprees,

593
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:23,400
<26-2,ESPOSITO>我们也发现您女儿的信用卡上
<26-2,ESPOSITO>We found some odd charges on your daughter's credit cards

594
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,810
<26-2,ESPOSITO>在过去几个月有异常消费记录
<26-2,ESPOSITO>over the past few months.

595
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:28,250
<26-3,RYAN>出租车记录  都是在深更半夜
<26-3,RYAN>For cab rides taken during the middle of the night.

596
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,220
<26-3,RYAN>你知道她是去干嘛了吗
<26-3,RYAN>Do you have any idea what she was doing

597
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:31,250
<26-3,RYAN>或者她是去哪里了
<26-3,RYAN>or where she was going?

598
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:33,070
<26-3,RYAN>这些都是在工作日夜晚
<26-3,RYAN>These charges are for weeknights.

599
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:34,410
<26-4,ESPOSITO>上学日夜晚
<26-4,ESPOSITO>School nights.

600
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,240
<26-4,ESPOSITO>那你们不知道这些
<26-4,ESPOSITO>So you weren't aware of this.

601
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:39,140
<27-3,ESPOSITO>不  麦迪森都是在11点上床睡觉
<27-3,ESPOSITO>No, Madison was in bed by 11:00 every night, or...

602
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,040
<27-4,RYAN>至少我们觉得是
<27-4,RYAN>We thought she was.

603
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:43,350
<27-5,BECKETT>你们觉得她是不是卷入什么事情里了
<27-5,BECKETT>Do you think she got mixed up in something,

604
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:45,860
<27-2,BECKETT>所以她才会被杀
<27-2,BECKETT>And...that's the reason she died?

605
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:46,770
<27-3,ESPOSITO>这个我们还不知道
<27-3,ESPOSITO>We don't know.

606
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,180
<26-5,RYAN>不过我们在学校图书馆里找到了一些东西
<26-5,RYAN>But we did find something else in the school library.

607
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,330
<26-5,RYAN>在一本被掏空的书里
<26-5,RYAN>Inside of a hollowed-out book

608
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:53,080
<26-6,ESPOSITO>书上布满了您女儿的指纹
<26-6,ESPOSITO>with your daughter's fingerprints all over it.

609
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,100
<26-6,ESPOSITO>你们找到了什么
<26-6,ESPOSITO>What did you find?

610
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,850
<26-7,RYAN>价230万美元的德国无记名债券
<26-7,RYAN>$2.3 million in German bearer bonds.

611
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:01,510
<26-7,RYAN>无记名债券
<26-7,RYAN>Bearer bonds?

612
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,520
<26-8,ESPOSITO>这些是你的无记名债券吗  博蒙特先生
<26-8,ESPOSITO>Are these your bearer bonds, Mr. Beaumont?

613
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,250
<26-8,ESPOSITO>不  不是的
<26-8,ESPOSITO>Uh, no. No.

614
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,250
<26-9,RYAN>那你知道你女儿可能会在哪里得到这些呢
<26-9,RYAN>Do you know where your daughter could've gotten them?

615
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,000
<26-9,RYAN>查尔斯
<26-9,RYAN>Charles?

616
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,030
<26-9,RYAN>不知道  非常抱歉
<26-9,RYAN>No. Um, I'm sorry.

617
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:18,320
<26-9,RYAN>我们帮不了你
<26-9,RYAN>We can't help you.

618
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:20,080
<26-9,RYAN>来  戴安  我们走吧
<26-9,RYAN>Come on, Diane. We're done here.

619
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,160
<27-1,ESPOSITO>麦迪森的父亲肯定知道这些无记名债券
<27-1,ESPOSITO>There's no question Madison's dad knew about those bearer bonds.

620
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,420
<27-2,BECKETT>如果他们知道有关她女儿之死的信息
<27-2,BECKETT>Okay, if they have something to do with his daughter's death,

621
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:35,070
<27-2,BECKETT>那他为什么不愿意告诉我们呢
<27-2,BECKETT>then why wouldn't he want to tell us about them?

622
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:37,190
<27-3,ESPOSITO>等我们知道这些债券是哪来的就都清楚了
<27-3,ESPOSITO>We're not gonna know until we know where they came from.

623
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:38,690
<27-4,RYAN>我们正在根据债券上的序列号查询信息
<27-4,RYAN>We're tracking the serial numbers on the bonds

624
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:40,160
<27-4,RYAN>看看是否能找到最初的持有者
<27-4,RYAN>to see if we can locate the original owners,

625
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,520
<27-4,RYAN>不过这要花上点时间
<27-4,RYAN>but it's gonna take some time.

626
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:46,110
<27-5,BECKETT>这女孩究竟卷入什么事情里了
<27-5,BECKETT>What the hell was this girl mixed up in?

627
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:50,780
<28-1,CASTLE>以及这和乔丹的意念移物能力有什么联系
<28-1,CASTLE>And what does it have to do with Jordan's telekinesis?

628
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:55,230
<28-2,BECKETT>没关系  因为乔丹根本就不会意念移物
<28-2,BECKETT>Nothing, because Jordan is not telekinetic.

629
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,220
<28-3,CASTLE>那你解释一下食堂的那段录像是怎么回事
<28-3,CASTLE>Well, explain that cafeteria video.

630
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,890
<28-4,BECKETT>我解释不了  卡塞尔
<28-4,BECKETT>I can't, Castle.

631
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:00,990
<28-4,BECKETT>但我告诉你  我肯定能找到解释的
<28-4,BECKETT>But I assure you, I will.

632
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,760
<28-5,CASTLE>那麦迪森的死又怎么说
<28-5,CASTLE>And what about Madison's death --

633
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:07,200
<28-5,CASTLE>被一股无形力量抛来投去  就像个布娃娃
<28-5,CASTLE>Being thrown around like a rag doll by an unseen force?

634
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,410
<28-6,BECKETT>你看不见并不意味着没人搞鬼
<28-6,BECKETT>Yeah, well, unseen doesn't mean that nobody was there.

635
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:11,160
<28-6,BECKETT>而我们应该关注的真正问题是
<28-6,BECKETT>And the real question that we should be asking

636
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,900
<28-6,BECKETT>一个17岁的小丫头
<28-6,BECKETT>is what is a 17-year-old doing

637
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:16,560
<28-6,BECKETT>藏着230万不记名债券干什么
<28-6,BECKETT>with $2.3 million in bearer bonds?

638
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:20,660
<28-6,BECKETT>这才是害死她的原因  不是什么超能力杀手
<28-6,BECKETT>That probably got her killed, not some psychic assassin.

639
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:23,360
<28-7,CASTLE>只怕对此我们只能各持己见了
<28-7,CASTLE>Well, perhaps we'll have to agree to disagree on that,

640
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,590
<28-7,CASTLE>但是这个我们应该能达成一致
<28-7,CASTLE>and agree to agree on this.

641
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:33,450
<28-8,BECKETT>"《公告牌》评选史上100首最浪漫的歌曲"
<28-8,BECKETT>"The billboard's top 100 most romantic songs of all time."

642
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:35,860
<28-9,CASTLE>我觉得我们的定情歌肯定得在这单子上
<28-9,CASTLE>I figure our song has got to be on that list somewhere.

643
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:38,660
<28-10,BECKETT>别卡塞尔  我才不会从一个什么单子上选歌
<28-10,BECKETT>No, Castle, I'm not choosing our song off of a list

644
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:42,180
<28-10,BECKETT>何况这单子上还有威豹的《给我一些甜蜜》
<28-10,BECKETT>that includes Def Leppard's "Pour some sugar on me."

645
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:44,610
<28-11,CASTLE>我敢肯定这首歌
<28-11,CASTLE>Uh, that song, I am sure,

646
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:47,860
<28-11,CASTLE>在87年点燃了无数艳舞厅恋情
<28-11,CASTLE>ignited many a strip-club romance in 1987.

647
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:50,770
<28-11,CASTLE>1987年啊
<28-11,CASTLE>1987...

648
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,830
<28-11,CASTLE>那一年手镯合唱团
<28-11,CASTLE>A year when the Bangles

649
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:55,290
<28-11,CASTLE>教会了我们像埃及人一样走路[该组合名作]
<28-11,CASTLE>taught us how to walk like an Egyptian,

650
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,700
<28-11,CASTLE>邦乔维教会了我们如何"活在祈祷中"
<28-11,CASTLE>Bon Jovi taught us how to live on nothing but a prayer,

651
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:01,520
<28-11,CASTLE>瑞克·艾斯里教会了我们怎么笑
<28-11,CASTLE>and Rick Astley taught us how to laugh.

652
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:03,930
<28-12,BECKETT>你感到怀旧是因为你今天又被拉回了
<28-12,BECKETT>You're feeling nostalgic after getting pulled back in time

653
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:05,670
<28-12,BECKETT>在菲克罗夫特预科学校上学的时光
<28-12,BECKETT>to your days at Faircroft Prep.

654
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:07,950
<28-12,BECKETT>是啊  重游故地感觉很奇妙
<28-12,BECKETT>Yeah, it was strange going back.

655
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:11,610
<28-13,CASTLE>一切看起来都小了点  却又和当年并无二致
<28-13,CASTLE>Everything seems smaller, yet unchanged.

656
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:13,650
<28-13,CASTLE>走廊还是那个走廊
<28-13,CASTLE>I mean, the hallways are the same.

657
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:14,820
<28-13,CASTLE>校长还是那位校长
<28-13,CASTLE>The principal is the same.

658
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:18,030
<28-13,CASTLE>连舞会横幅上的标识都没变
<28-13,CASTLE>Same banners for school dances.

659
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:20,200
<28-13,CASTLE>你为什么没参加你的毕业舞会
<28-13,CASTLE>A-and why didn't you go to your prom?

660
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:22,070
<28-13,CASTLE>我敢肯定17岁妙龄的凯瑟琳·贝克特
<28-13,CASTLE>I'm sure a 17-year-old Katherine Beckett

661
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:24,160
<28-13,CASTLE>有不少追求者
<28-13,CASTLE>had many a young suitor.

662
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,900
<28-14,BECKETT>只不过当年的叛逆小凯特太酷了
<28-14,BECKETT>Yeah, except rebel Becks was a little too cool

663
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,640
<28-14,BECKETT>看不上傻乎乎的舞会  所以
<28-14,BECKETT>to go to a silly dance, so...

664
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:32,450
<28-14,BECKETT>我们去参加了东村区的一个诗朗诵会
<28-14,BECKETT>we went to a poetry slam in the east village instead.

665
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,600
<28-14,BECKETT>回忆往昔  这是我希望
<28-14,BECKETT>It was one of those seminal moments

666
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,480
<28-14,BECKETT>没有错过的重要时刻之一
<28-14,BECKETT>that I kind of wish I didn't skip out on.

667
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:38,520
<28-15,CASTLE>敬那些我们错过的时光
<28-15,CASTLE>To the things we missed.

668
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,470
<28-16,BECKETT>也敬我们未曾错过的美好
<28-16,BECKETT>And to those we didn't.

669
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,730
<29-1,ESPOSITO>好的  有进展尽快回话
<29-1,ESPOSITO>All right, get back to me as soon as you can.

670
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:52,920
<29-1,ESPOSITO>那些不记名债券还是没进展
<29-1,ESPOSITO>Hey! So, still no word on the bearer bonds,

671
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,120
<29-1,ESPOSITO>但有越来越多的迹象表明
<29-1,ESPOSITO>but it's looking more and more

672
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,890
<29-1,ESPOSITO>麦迪森的所谓"课外活动"都是违法的
<29-1,ESPOSITO>like Madison's extracurriculars were of a criminal nature.

673
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:59,700
<29-2,BECKETT>-你有什么发现  -这是鉴证组发现的
<29-2,BECKETT>- What'd you find? - It's what CSU found --

674
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:01,370
<29-3,ESPOSITO>一枚古董戒指
<29-3,ESPOSITO>An antique ring.

675
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:04,520
<29-3,ESPOSITO>就藏在图书馆书架的后面
<29-3,ESPOSITO>It was at the back of the shelf at the library.

676
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,660
<29-3,ESPOSITO>肯定是从那本书里漏出来了  但我们查到
<29-3,ESPOSITO>Must've slipped out of the book. But we were able to I.D.

677
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,920
<29-3,ESPOSITO>这戒指是几周前一起失窃案中丢失的
<29-3,ESPOSITO>it as having been stolen in a burglary a few weeks ago.

678
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,330
<29-4,BECKETT>这戒指是谁的
<29-4,BECKETT>Who did this ring belong to?

679
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:12,500
<29-5,ESPOSITO>属于一个孩子在菲克罗夫特上学的母亲
<29-5,ESPOSITO>Uh, to the mom of a kid who attends Faircroft.

680
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,330
<29-5,ESPOSITO>而且在过去三个月里有12家
<29-5,ESPOSITO>Turns out that a dozen Faircroft families

681
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:16,210
<29-5,ESPOSITO>子女在菲克罗夫特上学的家庭都失窃了
<29-5,ESPOSITO>have been burglarized over the past 3 months,

682
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,500
<29-5,ESPOSITO>主要丢的都是手表和珠宝
<29-5,ESPOSITO>mainly watches and jewelry.

683
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,150
<29-6,BECKETT>那想必这些失窃案的案发时间
<29-6,BECKETT>Let me guess -- the dates of the burglaries

684
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:21,290
<29-6,BECKETT>和麦迪森夜不归宿的时间完全吻合
<29-6,BECKETT>match the dates that Madison was out all night.

685
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:23,700
<29-8,CASTLE>-说对了  -她肯定把这些赃物卖了
<29-8,CASTLE>- Bingo. - She must've fenced what she stole,

686
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,630
<29-8,CASTLE>所以才能付得起那些信用卡账单
<29-8,CASTLE>which explains why she was able to pay off her credit cards.

687
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:28,380
<29-9,BECKETT>也说明了她为什么一大早就去图书馆
<29-9,BECKETT>It also explains the early-morning visits to the library.

688
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:31,910
<29-9,BECKETT>她肯定把赃物都藏在托尔斯泰的书里
<29-9,BECKETT>She'd stash her haul in Tolstoy after each burglary,

689
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:33,190
<29-9,BECKETT>就算有人发现了她
<29-9,BECKETT>And if anyone caught on to her,

690
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:34,430
<29-10,CASTLE>他们也找不到这些赃物
<29-10,CASTLE>they'd never be able to find the loot.

691
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:35,550
<29-10,CASTLE>就算找到了赃物
<29-10,CASTLE>And if they did find the loot,

692
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:37,180
<29-10,CASTLE>也查不到她头上
<29-10,CASTLE>they wouldn't be able to connect it to her.

693
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:39,210
<29-11,ESPOSITO>我与麦迪森在学校的所有朋友都核实过了
<29-11,ESPOSITO>Well, I checked with all of Madison's friends at school.

694
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:40,570
<29-11,ESPOSITO>谁都不知道她在做什么
<29-11,ESPOSITO>None of them seem to know what she was up to.

695
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:42,620
<29-12,RYAN>无记名债券有进展了
<29-12,RYAN>Hey, hey. Got a hit on those bearer bonds.

696
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:44,300
<29-12,RYAN>原来  这些债券是在弗洛勒尔帕克
<29-12,RYAN>Turns out, they were stolen months ago

697
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,680
<29-12,RYAN>的一起银行抢劫案中失窃的
<29-12,RYAN>in an armed robbery of a bank in Floral Park.

698
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,520
<29-12,RYAN>劫匪把保险箱掠夺一空
<29-12,RYAN>The crew cleaned out the safety deposit boxes.

699
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,240
<29-13,ESPOSITO>慢着  你是说
<29-13,ESPOSITO>Hold up, are you saying

700
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,320
<29-13,ESPOSITO>一个17岁的预科生抢了一家银行
<29-13,ESPOSITO>that a 17-year-old prep-school girl robbed a bank?

701
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:54,800
<29-14,RYAN>不是  但估计她是把抢银行的人给劫了
<29-14,RYAN>No, but she might've robbed the guy who robbed the bank.

702
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,230
<29-14,RYAN>根据警方的报告
<29-14,RYAN>According to the police report,

703
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:59,170
<29-14,RYAN>银行劫案的主要嫌疑人
<29-14,RYAN>the prime suspect in the bank robbery

704
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:01,680
<29-14,RYAN>名叫陈向祖的人
<29-14,RYAN>was one Xiangzu Chen,

705
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:05,530
<29-14,RYAN>以前是三合会的打手  后来自己单干
<29-14,RYAN>a former triad enforcer who went into business for himself.

706
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:08,340
<29-14,RYAN>地检已经有足够的证据起诉他
<29-14,RYAN>Now, the D.A. had enough evidence to indict him,

707
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:10,760
<29-14,RYAN>但他的辩护律师利用技术细节把他救出来了
<29-14,RYAN>but his defense attorney got him off on a technicality.

708
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,310
<29-14,RYAN>失窃债券从未被发现
<29-14,RYAN>The bonds were never recovered.

709
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:14,480
<29-15,CASTLE>这和麦迪森又有什么联系
<29-15,CASTLE>And how does any of this connect with Madison?

710
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,000
<29-16,RYAN>看看他的辩护律师是谁
<29-16,RYAN>Look who his defense attorney is.

711
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,590
<29-17,BECKETT>查尔斯·博蒙特  麦迪森的父亲
<29-17,BECKETT>Charles Beaumont, Madison's father?

712
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,460
<29-18,ESPOSITO>麦迪森肯定从她父亲那里听说了债券的事
<29-18,ESPOSITO>Madison must've heard about the bonds from her dad,

713
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:23,490
<29-18,ESPOSITO>知道了陈把债券藏在哪  值多少钱
<29-18,ESPOSITO>where Chen was hiding them, and how much they were worth.

714
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:25,670
<29-19,CASTLE>这对新手小偷来说可是个了不得的成绩
<29-19,CASTLE>That's a huge score for a budding thief.

715
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:27,870
<29-20,BECKETT>如果陈发现了他律师的小女儿
<29-20,BECKETT>And if Chen found out that his lawyer's little girl

716
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:30,540
<29-20,BECKETT>偷了他230万
<29-20,BECKETT>Stole $2.3 million from him --

717
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:32,930
<29-21,ESPOSITO>这绝对是砸开她脑壳的动机
<29-21,ESPOSITO>it'd be motive to bash her skull against the ceiling.

718
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,290
<30-1,ESPOSITO>贝克特  我们有麻烦了
<30-1,ESPOSITO>Yo, Beckett, we got a problem.

719
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:44,620
<30-2,BECKETT>-陈不见了  -他藏起来了
<30-2,BECKETT>- Chen's gone. - He went into hiding?

720
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:46,520
<30-3,ESPOSITO>他卖了他的房子  昨天搬走了
<30-3,ESPOSITO>He put his house on the market, and he moved out yesterday.

721
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:48,600
<30-4,BECKETT>这可不像是个无辜的人的反应
<30-4,BECKETT>That doesn't sound like the actions of an innocent man.

722
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,460
<30-4,BECKETT>他去哪了
<30-4,BECKETT>Where did he go?

723
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,500
<30-4,BECKETT>我们试着追踪他
<30-4,BECKETT>We're trying to track him down,

724
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,340
<30-5,ESPOSITO>但他家里人什么都不说
<30-5,ESPOSITO>but no one in his family's talking.

725
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,740
<30-5,ESPOSITO>莱恩正在询问他的房地产经纪人
<30-5,ESPOSITO>Ryan's bringing in his realtor right now

726
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:54,500
<30-5,ESPOSITO>看看她知不知道她的去向
<30-5,ESPOSITO>to see if she knows where he went.

727
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:58,380
<31-1,REALTOR>不  我不知道他在哪儿
<31-1,REALTOR>No. No, I have no idea where he is.

728
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:01,420
<31-1,REALTOR>我只知道他宁愿损失一大笔钱
<31-1,REALTOR>All I know is he was willing to take a huge loss

729
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,660
<31-1,REALTOR>也要尽快结清交易
<31-1,REALTOR>to close immediately.

730
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,200
<31-1,REALTOR>他只想把房子脱手
<31-1,REALTOR>He just wanted the house out of his name

731
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,820
<31-1,REALTOR>然后在账户里拿到钱
<31-1,REALTOR>and the cash in his account.

732
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,570
<31-2,RYAN>你打算往哪里汇款
<31-2,RYAN>Where were you supposed to send the money?

733
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:10,730
<31-3,REALTOR>他给了我一个中国银行的汇款号码
<31-3,REALTOR>He gave me a routing number to a bank in China.

734
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:12,490
<31-4,RYAN>他有没有告诉你
<31-4,RYAN>Did he give you any reason

735
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:14,260
<31-4,RYAN>为什么这么急着脱手
<31-4,RYAN>why he was looking to unload so quickly?

736
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:17,360
<31-5,REALTOR>他说他生意上需要这笔钱
<31-5,REALTOR>Well, he said he needed the money for business reasons,

737
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,390
<31-5,REALTOR>但我知道他有所隐瞒
<31-5,REALTOR>but I could tell he was hiding something.

738
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:23,130
<31-5,REALTOR>我的工作就是了解我卖出的每套房子的每个细节
<31-5,REALTOR>It's my job to know everything about every home I sell,

739
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,810
<31-5,REALTOR>所以我打听了一下
<31-5,REALTOR>so I asked around.

740
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,980
<31-5,REALTOR>显然  陈先生很迷信
<31-5,REALTOR>Apparently, Mr. Chen is very superstitious,

741
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:34,090
<31-5,REALTOR>-而且据他邻居说  发生了一些事  -什么事
<31-5,REALTOR>- and according to the neighbors, something happened. - What?

742
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:36,990
<31-7,REALTOR>我不知道他们葫芦里卖的什么药
<31-7,REALTOR>Well, I don't know what they're putting in the water out there,

743
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:39,130
<31-7,REALTOR>不过隔壁邻居说
<31-7,REALTOR>but according to the next-door neighbor,

744
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:41,600
<31-7,REALTOR>几天前的晚上  有东西把陈先生和他手下
<31-7,REALTOR>something chased Mr. Chen and his men

745
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,270
<31-7,REALTOR>赶出了那间房子
<31-7,REALTOR>out of the house a few nights ago.

746
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:44,260
<31-8,RYAN>"有东西"是什么意思
<31-8,RYAN>What do you mean, "something"?

747
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:47,470
<31-9,REALTOR>某种东西  就是…
<31-9,REALTOR>Some thing, as in...

748
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:49,830
<31-10,RYAN>鬼
<31-10,RYAN>A ghost?

749
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:52,420
<31-11,REALTOR>这个邻居说他向窗外看
<31-11,REALTOR>This neighbor said that he looked out his window,

750
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:55,430
<31-11,REALTOR>看到院子里的家具都在绕着院子飞
<31-11,REALTOR>and all of the patio furniture was flying around the yard.

751
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:57,660
<31-11,REALTOR>把陈先生吓坏了
<31-11,REALTOR>It scared the hell out of Mr. Chen.

752
00:29:57,750 --> 00:30:00,140
<31-11,REALTOR>他和他手下就离开了房子  再也没回去过
<31-11,REALTOR>He and his men left the house, and he never returned.

753
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,320
<31-11,REALTOR>当然  他不会我提这种细节
<31-11,REALTOR>Obviously, that detail was left out of the listing.

754
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:07,890
<32-1,BECKETT>陈不仅仅离开了房子
<32-1,BECKETT>So, Chen didn't just leave his house.

755
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,140
<32-2,CASTLE>他还离开了这个国家
<32-2,CASTLE>He left the country.

756
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:12,390
<32-1,BECKETT>运输安全管理局证实了他在麦迪森被杀时
<32-1,BECKETT>TSA confirms that he was on a flight to Shanghai

757
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:13,630
<32-1,BECKETT>正在去上海的飞机上
<32-1,BECKETT>when Madison was murdered.

758
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:17,080
<32-2,CASTLE>-他不是凶手  -再说一次他为什么出国
<32-2,CASTLE>- He's not our killer. - Tell me again why he left the country.

759
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,620
<32-3,BECKETT>什么事
<32-3,BECKETT>What?

760
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:22,430
<32-4,RYAN>你不会想听这个的
<32-4,RYAN>Well, you're not gonna want to hear this,

761
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:25,040
<32-4,RYAN>但我跟进询问了陈的邻居
<32-4,RYAN>but I followed up with Chen's neighbors.

762
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:26,610
<32-4,RYAN>有几个人确认了他们在三天前的晚上
<32-4,RYAN>Now, several confirmed seeing

763
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:29,700
<32-4,RYAN>在陈家看到了
<32-4,RYAN>what can only be described as a telekinetic event

764
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:31,680
<32-4,RYAN>只能称之为隔空移物的事件
<32-4,RYAN>at Chen's property three nights ago.

765
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:34,610
<32-5,CASTLE>提醒我一下  德国无记名债券
<32-5,CASTLE>And remind me how stolen German bearer bonds

766
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:36,240
<32-5,CASTLE>怎么跟意念移物没关系来着
<32-5,CASTLE>have nothing to do with telekinesis.

767
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,780
<32-6,BECKETT>一定会有合理解释的  好吗
<32-6,BECKETT>You know, there's a logical explanation, okay?

768
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,980
<32-7,CASTLE>愿闻其详
<32-7,CASTLE>I'd love to hear it.

769
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:43,670
<32-7,CASTLE>好吧
<32-7,CASTLE>Okay, fine.

770
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:47,270
<32-8,BECKETT>麦迪森知道那些债券就在陈的房子里
<32-8,BECKETT>Uh, Madison knew that those bonds are in Chen's house.

771
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:50,060
<32-8,BECKETT>毕竟她父亲是他的律师
<32-8,BECKETT>Her father is, after all, his lawyer.

772
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:52,980
<32-8,BECKETT>所以她想再发一笔横财
<32-8,BECKETT>Um, so, she's looking for the next big score.

773
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,820
<32-8,BECKETT>她决定好好探查一下那间房子
<32-8,BECKETT>She decides to scope out the house,

774
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:58,320
<32-8,BECKETT>但是陈的保镖一直都在附近看着
<32-8,BECKETT>except Chen's guards are around all the time.

775
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,000
<32-8,BECKETT>所以在知道陈很迷信后
<32-8,BECKETT>So, knowing that Chen is superstitious,

776
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,260
<32-8,BECKETT>她自导自演了一场超自然事件
<32-8,BECKETT>she stages a supernatural event

777
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:05,630
<32-8,BECKETT>好把所有人都赶出去
<32-8,BECKETT>to scare everyone out of the house.

778
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:07,960
<32-9,RYAN>这还真是...挺合理
<32-9,RYAN>That's actually really... logical.

779
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:09,060
<32-10,BECKETT>谢谢
<32-10,BECKETT>Thank you.

780
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:11,430
<32-11,CASTLE>但其他事怎么解释  比如食堂里发生的
<32-11,CASTLE>But what about the other events -- the cafeteria?

781
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:13,210
<32-12,BECKETT>她在练习  看是不是真能成功
<32-12,BECKETT>Dry run, to see if she could pull it off.

782
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:15,150
<32-13,CASTLE>还有她的死...也是她自导自演的吗
<32-13,CASTLE>And her own death -- did she stage that, too?

783
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:20,190
<32-15,BECKETT>好吧  你说得对
<32-15,BECKETT>Okay, fine. All right. You're right.

784
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:22,150
<32-15,BECKETT>麦迪森不可能单干这些事
<32-15,BECKETT>Um, Madison couldn't have done this alone.

785
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,000
<32-15,BECKETT>所以还有别人参与了
<32-15,BECKETT>So someone else was involved.

786
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:25,940
<32-15,BECKETT>麦迪森一定有个同伙
<32-15,BECKETT>You know what? Madison had to have had a partner.

787
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:28,790
<32-16,CASTLE>说得对  一个能隔空移物的同伙
<32-16,CASTLE>You're right -- a partner with telekinetic abilities.

788
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:31,290
<32-17,BECKETT>或是假装能隔空移物的人
<32-17,BECKETT>Or someone with the ability to fake it.

789
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:34,490
<32-17,BECKETT>麦迪森想独吞的时候  那个同伙就盯上她了
<32-17,BECKETT>And when Madison wouldn't share, the partner went after her.

790
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:37,780
<32-17,BECKETT>只要找到麦迪森的同伙  就能找到凶手
<32-17,BECKETT>So we find Madison's partner, we'll find the killer.

791
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:39,920
<32-18,ESPOSITO>刚从鉴证组来的消息
<32-18,ESPOSITO>Hey. Just heard back from CSU.

792
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:42,260
<32-18,ESPOSITO>他们在陈家里找到了几个指纹
<32-18,ESPOSITO>They recovered a number of prints in Chen's house.

793
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:43,690
<32-18,ESPOSITO>和麦迪森的匹配
<32-18,ESPOSITO>Matched a set to Madison.

794
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:44,710
<32-19,CASTLE>和乔丹呢
<32-19,CASTLE>And to Jordan?

795
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,640
<32-20,ESPOSITO>目前还没有  但他们还在处理中
<32-20,ESPOSITO>Not yet, but they're still in process.

796
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,220
<32-20,ESPOSITO>他们也检查了
<32-20,ESPOSITO>They also examined the patio

797
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:50,310
<32-20,ESPOSITO>陈的家具乱飞的露台
<32-20,ESPOSITO>where Chen's furniture earned its frequent-flyer miles.

798
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:52,260
<32-20,ESPOSITO>找到了有蓝色痕迹的脚印
<32-20,ESPOSITO>Found shoe prints with traces of blue,

799
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:53,500
<32-20,ESPOSITO>上面还有彩色喷漆
<32-20,ESPOSITO>iridescent spray paint on them.

800
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:56,460
<32-21,CASTLE>让我猜一下  是天蓝色的
<32-21,CASTLE>Let me guess -- cerulean blue.

801
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:01,260
<33-1,CASTLE>能暂停吗  看那儿  左边
<33-1,CASTLE>Ooh! Can you freeze that? Look there, on the left.

802
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:02,610
<33-2,TORI>我看看能不能放大
<33-2,TORI>Let me see if I can zoom in.

803
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,590
<33-3,CASTLE>就是他  是卢卡斯  他当时在食堂
<33-3,CASTLE>It's him! It's Lucas. He was at the cafeteria.

804
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:09,540
<33-4,BECKETT>而且根据那个喷漆  他显然也去过陈家
<33-4,BECKETT>And apparently at Chen's place, based on that paint.

805
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:11,750
<33-5,CASTLE>所以卢卡斯才是那个有超能力的人  不是乔丹
<33-5,CASTLE>So, Lucas was the one with the power and not Jordan.

806
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:13,770
<33-6,BECKETT>是啊  自导自演这一切的能力
<33-6,BECKETT>Yeah, the power to stage these events.

807
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:15,390
<33-6,BECKETT>可他为什么要做麦迪森的同伙
<33-6,BECKETT>But why would he be Madison's accomplice?

808
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:17,620
<33-7,CASTLE>-他说他讨厌她  -或许他是后来才讨厌她的
<33-7,CASTLE>- He said that he hated her. - Maybe he came to hate her.

809
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:18,770
<33-7,CASTLE>所以他才杀了她
<33-7,CASTLE>That's why he killed her.

810
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:21,020
<33-8,BECKETT>而且既然所有人都觉得
<33-8,BECKETT>And with everyone assuming

811
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:23,200
<33-8,BECKETT>乔丹才是有隔空移物能力的人
<33-8,BECKETT>what Jordan was the one with the telekinetic abilities,

812
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,500
<33-8,BECKETT>还有比这更好的撇清嫌疑的办法吗
<33-8,BECKETT>what better way to throw people off his scent?

813
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,490
<34-1,BECKETT>就是这儿了
<34-1,BECKETT>This is it.

814
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:32,650
<34-2,CASTLE>那枪可没什么用
<34-2,CASTLE>That gun's not gonna be much help

815
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:35,080
<34-2,CASTLE>卢卡斯可以用念力把它从你手中夺走
<34-2,CASTLE>when Lucas rips it from your hand with his mind.

816
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:36,310
<34-3,BECKETT>卡塞尔  最后一次跟你说
<34-3,BECKETT>Castle, for the last time,

817
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,770
<34-3,BECKETT>隔空移物根本就不...
<34-3,BECKETT>telekinesis is not r--

818
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:43,810
<34-4,CASTLE>说完啊
<34-4,CASTLE>You were saying?

819
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,550
<34-4,CASTLE>够了
<34-4,CASTLE>Come on.

820
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:48,380
<34-5,BECKETT>我们一定能查出发生了什么事
<34-5,BECKETT>We're gonna finally figure out what's going on here.

821
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:53,580
<35-1,BECKETT>不许动
<35-1,BECKETT>Don't move.

822
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:55,570
<35-2,JORDAN>不是你想的那样的
<35-2,JORDAN>It's not what you think.

823
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:02,720
<35-3,LUCAS>别伤害她
<35-3,LUCAS>Don't hurt her.

824
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,910
<35-4,LUCAS>她和这事无关
<35-4,LUCAS>She had nothing to do with this.

825
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,290
<35-4,LUCAS>都是我的错
<35-4,LUCAS>It's all my fault.

826
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:15,400
<36-1,LUCAS>我没想过要让这一切发生
<36-1,LUCAS>I never meant for any of this to happen.

827
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,990
<36-1,LUCAS>我没想过要让人受伤
<36-1,LUCAS>I never meant for anyone to get hurt.

828
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:18,730
<36-2,BECKETT>那我们在你家看到的
<36-2,BECKETT>So, what we saw at your house,

829
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:21,850
<36-2,BECKETT>食堂发生的事  是你干的吗
<36-2,BECKETT>that event at the cafeteria -- that was you?

830
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,480
<36-3,LUCAS>你肯定觉得我是个怪胎  对吧
<36-3,LUCAS>Yeah. You must think I'm a freak, huh?

831
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,800
<36-4,BECKETT>你怎么做到的
<36-4,BECKETT>Uh how did you do it?

832
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:30,280
<36-5,LUCAS>你理解不了  大多数人都不懂
<36-5,LUCAS>You wouldn't understand. Most people don't.

833
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,290
<36-5,LUCAS>这就是我学着隐藏自己的原因
<36-5,LUCAS>That's why I've learned to hide what I am.

834
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,850
<36-6,CASTLE>意念移物
<36-6,CASTLE>Telekinetic.

835
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,200
<36-6,CASTLE>什么
<36-6,CASTLE>What?

836
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,510
<36-7,LUCAS>不是  聪明而已
<36-7,LUCAS>No -- smart.

837
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:40,460
<36-7,LUCAS>你懂的  当你很聪明
<36-7,LUCAS>You know, people don't like it when you're smart,

838
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:42,230
<36-7,LUCAS>做些其他人不明白的事  可不招人喜欢
<36-7,LUCAS>when you do things that people don't understand.

839
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:45,110
<36-7,LUCAS>我是说  你们看到的那些  是我操作的而已
<36-7,LUCAS>I mean, all that stuff you saw, I rigged.

840
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:48,800
<36-8,CASTLE>操作  可你确实让椅子桌子移动了
<36-8,CASTLE>Rigged? But you made the chairs move, the tables!

841
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:51,200
<36-9,LUCAS>是的  做特技是我的一个兴趣
<36-9,LUCAS>Right. Special effects are kind of my hobby.

842
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:51,790
<36-9,LUCAS>事实上  这是件很有意思的事
<36-9,LUCAS>It's pretty amazing, actually,

843
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:54,460
<36-9,LUCAS>像用鱼线  磁铁就能做出来的事情
<36-9,LUCAS>what you can do with, like, some fishing wire and magnets.

844
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:56,550
<36-9,LUCAS>人太好骗了
<36-9,LUCAS>And people are pretty gullible.

845
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:01,570
<36-10,LUCAS>当我看见那些女生欺负乔丹
<36-10,LUCAS>Now, when I saw those girls being so mean to Jordan,

846
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:03,300
<36-10,LUCAS>我只是  只是想制止她们
<36-10,LUCAS>I just -- I just wanted to make them stop.

847
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:05,540
<36-10,LUCAS>我想如果能够让她们害怕她
<36-10,LUCAS>And I figured if I make them afraid of her,

848
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:07,120
<36-10,LUCAS>这些女生就会离她远远的  你知道吗
<36-10,LUCAS>they'll leave her alone, you know?

849
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,670
<36-11,BECKETT>所以之后  你就伪造了
<36-11,BECKETT>So, then, you faked the whole

850
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:11,460
<36-11,BECKETT>食堂意念移物事件
<36-11,BECKETT>telekinetic event at the cafeteria.

851
00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:13,530
<36-11,BECKETT>没错
<36-11,BECKETT>Yeah.

852
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:15,460
<37-1,JORDAN>他会有什么事吗
<37-1,JORDAN>What's going to happen to him?

853
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:17,370
<37-2,ESPOSITO>这就要看他干了些什么
<37-2,ESPOSITO>That all depends on what he did.

854
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:21,650
<37-3,JORDAN>他只是想保护我
<37-3,JORDAN>He was just trying to protect me.

855
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:29,050
<37-3,JORDAN>从来没有人为我做过那些事
<37-3,JORDAN>I've never had anyone do anything like that for me before.

856
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:34,050
<37-3,JORDAN>这件事起作用了
<37-3,JORDAN>And it worked.

857
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:38,230
<38-1,LUCAS>大家都相信了  除了麦迪森
<38-1,LUCAS>I convinced everybody... except Madison.

858
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:40,120
<38-1,LUCAS>她  发现了我所做的事情
<38-1,LUCAS>She, uh, figured out what I'd done,

859
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,970
<38-1,LUCAS>她威胁我  说要
<38-1,LUCAS>and then she threatened to -- to --

860
00:34:41,970 --> 00:34:43,710
<38-1,LUCAS>要向教导处告发我
<38-1,LUCAS>to turn me in to the administration

861
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:44,780
<38-1,LUCAS>如果我不帮她的话
<38-1,LUCAS>if I didn't help her.

862
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:46,130
<38-1,LUCAS>你知道  知道
<38-1,LUCAS>And you know -- you know --

863
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:48,420
<38-1,LUCAS>你知道他们会怎么处理拿着奖学金的学生
<38-1,LUCAS>You know what they would do to a scholarship kid

864
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,220
<38-1,LUCAS>恐吓一屋子学生的事
<38-1,LUCAS>who terrorized a room full of students?

865
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:53,100
<38-2,CASTLE>她让你做了什么
<38-2,CASTLE>What did she ask you to do?

866
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,640
<38-3,LUCAS>在韦斯切斯特有所房子
<38-3,LUCAS>There was a house in, uh -- in Westchester,

867
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,020
<38-3,LUCAS>她想进到那所房里里面
<38-3,LUCAS>and she said she needed to get inside.

868
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,960
<38-3,LUCAS>我要做的就是分散主人的注意力
<38-3,LUCAS>And I was supposed to create a diversion

869
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,270
<38-3,LUCAS>把他吓跑
<38-3,LUCAS>to scare the owner out.

870
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:02,620
<38-4,BECKETT>你知道她在那所房子里找什么吗
<38-4,BECKETT>Do you know what she was after in the house?

871
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:05,140
<38-5,LUCAS>不知道  我只想完成她让我做的事情
<38-5,LUCAS>No. No idea. I just wanted to do whatever she said

872
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:07,120
<38-5,LUCAS>这样我才能继续自己的生活
<38-5,LUCAS>so I could get on with my life.

873
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:09,150
<38-6,BECKETT>这就是你杀害她的原因  因为她不放手
<38-6,BECKETT>Which is why you killed her -- because she wouldn't let you.

874
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:10,770
<38-7,LUCAS>不是的  我没有  我没有杀人
<38-7,LUCAS>No, I-I didn't -- I didn't kill anybody!

875
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:13,470
<38-8,BECKETT>卢卡斯  麦迪森正在打一通视频电话
<38-8,BECKETT>Lucas, Madison was on a face time call

876
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:14,500
<38-8,BECKETT>当她被害的时候
<38-8,BECKETT>when she was killed.

877
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,430
<38-8,BECKETT>目击证人说看到一股无形的力量
<38-8,BECKETT>Witnesses reported an invisible force

878
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:17,650
<38-8,BECKETT>在屋子里拖拽着她
<38-8,BECKETT>tossing her around the room.

879
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:20,450
<38-8,BECKETT>他们说这是意念移物事件
<38-8,BECKETT>They described it as a telekinetic event.

880
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:22,820
<38-8,BECKETT>刚刚你承认了你的杀人动机
<38-8,BECKETT>Now, you just admitted to motive.

881
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,630
<38-8,BECKETT>我们所有的嫌疑人当中
<38-8,BECKETT>And out of all of our suspects,

882
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:27,200
<38-8,BECKETT>只有你才有能力做到
<38-8,BECKETT>you're the only one capable of pulling that off.

883
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,160
<38-8,BECKETT>是的
<38-8,BECKETT>Yeah.

884
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,190
<38-9,LUCAS>没错  你说对了  是我做的
<38-9,LUCAS>Yeah, you're right. I did pull that off...

885
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,870
<38-9,LUCAS>但那是和麦迪森一起做的
<38-9,LUCAS>with Madison.

886
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:38,020
<39-1,LUCAS>那是麦迪森强迫我做的第一件事
<39-1,LUCAS>It was the first thing Madison forced me to do.

887
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,730
<39-1,LUCAS>看  我把它做得像是一通视频电话
<39-1,LUCAS>See, I made it look and sound like a face time call,

888
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:42,440
<39-1,LUCAS>但是这  只是一个视频
<39-1,LUCAS>but it's -- it's just a video.

889
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:44,310
<39-1,LUCAS>很显然  她的一个朋友
<39-1,LUCAS>Apparently, one of her friends

890
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:46,430
<39-1,LUCAS>被食堂的表演搞得魂不守舍
<39-1,LUCAS>was pretty disturbed by the cafeteria stunt,

891
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:48,630
<39-1,LUCAS>所以她弄了这个来吓吓她
<39-1,LUCAS>so she did this to really freak her out.

892
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:54,420
<39-2,BECKETT>确实是她朋友描述的那样
<39-2,BECKETT>Exactly how her friends describe it.

893
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:59,100
<39-3,LUCAS>这里  就是结尾  没有特效
<39-3,LUCAS>Now, here's just the end, with no effects.

894
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,170
<39-5,LUCAS>-怎么样  -看起来不错
<39-5,LUCAS>- How was that? - That looked good.

895
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,270
<39-6,MADISON>我们回放看一下
<39-6,MADISON>Let's play it back.

896
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:06,760
<39-6,MADISON>等她看到这个肯定吓死
<39-6,MADISON>She is so gonna freak when she sees this.

897
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:09,540
<39-7,CASTLE>她会认为是你那个变态心上人会找上她的
<39-7,CASTLE>She'll think your psycho sweetheart is coming for her next.

898
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,540
<39-7,CASTLE>-天啊  -好了  废柴  帮我把威压解下来
<39-7,CASTLE>All right, loser. Help me get this harness off.

899
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,240
<39-7,CASTLE>你什么时候做的视频
<39-7,CASTLE>When did you make this?

900
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:16,350
<39-8,LUCAS>上周
<39-8,LUCAS>Uh, last week.

901
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:19,800
<39-8,LUCAS>我把最后一部分处理了之后邮件给了麦迪森
<39-8,LUCAS>I edited that last part out and e-mailed it to Madison.

902
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:22,020
<39-9,CASTLE>杀人凶手肯定拿到了这个
<39-9,CASTLE>Our killer must've gotten their hands on this.

903
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:23,230
<39-9,CASTLE>他们用这个视频来掩盖犯罪事实
<39-9,CASTLE>They used the video to cover their crime

904
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:26,260
<39-9,CASTLE>让目击者认为他们看到了杀人现场
<39-9,CASTLE>by making witnesses believe they were watching the murder live.

905
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:27,730
<39-10,BECKETT>还有谁知道这个视频
<39-10,BECKETT>Who else knew about this video?

906
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:30,290
<39-11,LUCAS>据我所知  只有我  麦迪森
<39-11,LUCAS>Uh, as far as I know, just me, Madison,

907
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:33,420
<39-11,LUCAS>还有麦迪森要捉弄的那个闺蜜
<39-11,LUCAS>and whichever bitch friend Madison pranked with this.

908
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:37,020
<39-12,BECKET>那个闺蜜就是我们要找的凶手
<39-12,BECKET>Then that friend is our killer.

909
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:48,920
<40-1,BECKETT>打扰一下
<40-1,BECKETT>Mind if I cut in?

910
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:53,870
<41-1,HILLARY>邓南校长  发生什么事了
<41-1,HILLARY>Principal Dunnan, what's going on?

911
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:55,620
<41-1,HILLARY>我该问问你们两个
<41-1,HILLARY>I should ask you two that.

912
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:57,940
<41-2,DUNAN>在你们的储物柜里  我们发现了这些
<41-2,DUNAN>We found these inside your lockers,

913
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:00,540
<41-2,DUNAN>藏在里面的暗格中
<41-2,DUNAN>hidden under a false bottom inside.

914
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:02,190
<41-2,DUNAN>想要解释一下吗
<41-2,DUNAN>Care to explain?

915
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,300
<41-3,BECKETT>让我帮你吧
<41-3,BECKETT>Let me help you.

916
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:05,950
<41-3,BECKETT>所有的这些都是赃物
<41-3,BECKETT>It's all stolen property

917
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:08,710
<41-3,BECKETT>都是麦迪森·博蒙特作案得来的
<41-3,BECKETT>from thefts connected to Madison Beaumont.

918
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:11,290
<41-3,BECKETT>你俩就是她贼帮伙的同伙
<41-3,BECKETT>The two of you were partners in her little bling ring.

919
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:12,990
<41-4,CASTLE>至少麦迪森还挺聪明
<41-4,CASTLE>At least Madison was smart enough

920
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:15,860
<41-4,CASTLE>不会把偷来的东西藏在储物柜里
<41-4,CASTLE>not to hide her stolen stash in her locker.

921
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,310
<41-5,HILLARY>不知道你在说些什么
<41-5,HILLARY>I don't know what you're talking about.

922
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:18,920
<41-5,HILLARY>我从来没见过这些东西
<41-5,HILLARY>I've never seen that stuff before.

923
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,100
<41-5,HILLARY>我想你是见过的
<41-5,HILLARY>I think you have.

924
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:22,040
<41-6,BECKETT>我们已经把这里的每件东西
<41-6,BECKETT>We've matched each one of those items

925
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,270
<41-6,BECKETT>都和从这里的学生家里
<41-6,BECKETT>to property that was stolen

926
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:25,750
<41-6,BECKETT>偷窃的财物匹配过了
<41-6,BECKETT>from families that have students enrolled here.

927
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:27,250
<41-7,CASTLE>而你们的行动
<41-7,CASTLE>And we matched your movements

928
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:29,930
<41-7,CASTLE>符合这些入室盗窃罪发生的时间
<41-7,CASTLE>to the times when the burglaries were committed.

929
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:32,790
<41-8,DUNAN>你们偷窃就够糟的了  居然还对菲克罗夫特下手
<41-8,DUNAN>It's bad enough you stole, but from the Faircroft community?

930
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:35,050
<41-9,HILLARY>什么都别说  我爸是律师
<41-9,HILLARY>Don't say a word. My dad's a lawyer.

931
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:36,350
<41-9,HILLARY>不管出什么事他都能帮咱俩搞掂
<41-9,HILLARY>He can get us out of anything.

932
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:38,530
<41-10,BECKETT>-包括谋杀吗  -谋杀
<41-10,BECKETT>- Even murder? - Murder?

933
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:40,020
<41-11,KRIS>当麦迪森独自对那些不记名债券下手时
<41-11,KRIS>You must've felt betrayed

934
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:43,000
<41-12,CASTLE>你们肯定觉得自己遭到了背叛
<41-12,CASTLE>when Madison went after those bearer bonds alone.

935
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:45,140
<41-12,CASTLE>这可是百年一遇的机会啊  她却不带上你们
<41-12,CASTLE>Score of a lifetime, and she shut you out.

936
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,950
<41-12,CASTLE>-所以你们才杀了她对吧  -你在说什么呀
<41-12,CASTLE>- Is that why you killed her? - Hello?

937
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:49,710
<41-13,HILLARY>她被杀的时候我们在城市的另外一边
<41-13,HILLARY>We were halfway across town when that happened.

938
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:50,750
<41-13,HILLARY>有证人可以给我们作证的
<41-13,HILLARY>There are witnesses.

939
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:53,020
<41-13,HILLARY>我们通过视频电话看到她被杀的经过
<41-13,HILLARY>We saw her being killed on that Facetime call.

940
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:54,310
<41-14,BECKETT>你是说这通视频电话吗
<41-14,BECKETT>You mean this call?

941
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:57,590
<41-15,MADISON>等她看到这个肯定吓死
<41-15,MADISON>She is so gonna freak when she sees this.

942
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:59,770
<41-15,MADISON>她会认为是你那个变态心上人会找上她的
<41-15,MADISON>She'll think your psycho sweetheart is coming for her next.

943
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:02,090
<41-15,MADISON>-天啊  -好了  废柴  帮我把威压解下来
<41-15,MADISON>- Oh, my God. - All right, loser. Help me get this harness off.

944
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:09,110
<41-17,CASTLE>你看到的视频电话是麦迪森录好的恶作剧录像
<41-17,CASTLE>What you saw was a pre-recorded joke video that Madison made.

945
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:11,730
<41-17,CASTLE>你看到这段录像的时候  她早就已经死了
<41-17,CASTLE>By the time you watched it, she was already dead.

946
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:12,840
<41-18,BECKETT>凶手用这段录像作为自己的不在场证明
<41-18,BECKETT>Our killer used it as an alibi

947
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,680
<41-18,BECKETT>让自己看上去像是在案发当时
<41-18,BECKETT>to make it look like she was halfway across town

948
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,000
<41-18,BECKETT>已经跨过这座城市到达另一边了
<41-18,BECKETT>when the murder happened.

949
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:18,240
<41-18,BECKETT>她还特意找了个朋友做证人
<41-18,BECKETT>She also witnessed it alongside a friend.

950
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,290
<41-19,CASTLE>所以你以为是实时的视频通话
<41-19,CASTLE>So what you thought was a Facetime call

951
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:23,040
<41-19,CASTLE>实际上只是一段
<41-19,CASTLE>was actually a video...

952
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:25,200
<41-19,CASTLE>在凶手的手机上播放的录像
<41-19,CASTLE>played on the killer's phone.

953
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,440
<41-19,CASTLE>我说错了吗  克丽丝
<41-19,CASTLE>Isn't that right, Kris?

954
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:29,600
<41-19,CASTLE>不
<41-19,CASTLE>No.

955
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,770
<41-20,HILLARY>-求求你告诉我这不是真的  -什么不是真的
<41-20,HILLARY>- Please tell me you didn't. - Didn't what?

956
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:34,680
<41-21,KRIS>难道你还想继续跟她玩那套变态游戏吗
<41-21,KRIS>Didn't want to play her psycho games anymore?

957
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:36,610
<41-21,KRIS>我只想退出
<41-21,KRIS>I just wanted out.

958
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:38,730
<41-21,KRIS>但是当我跟她说的时候  她不许我退出
<41-21,KRIS>But when I told her, she wouldn't let me quit.

959
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,550
<41-21,KRIS>她说她会毁了我
<41-21,KRIS>She said that she would destroy me!

960
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,370
<41-21,KRIS>她会毁了我们
<41-21,KRIS>That she would destroy us!

961
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:46,640
<41-21,KRIS>所以我就想  既然她已经给我准备好了
<41-21,KRIS>So I thought, why should we take the blame

962
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,290
<41-21,KRIS>完美的不在场证明  为什么还要被她拖下水呢
<41-21,KRIS>when she'd already given me the perfect alibi?

963
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,120
<41-22,BECKETT>而你只需要将犯罪现场布置得跟录像中一样就行
<41-22,BECKETT>And all you had to do was match the crime scene to the video,

964
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,170
<41-22,BECKETT>所以你把麦迪森的血涂到了天花板上
<41-22,BECKETT>which is why you transferred Madison's blood to the ceiling.

965
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:58,440
<41-23,HILLARY>她是拉拉队队长
<41-23,HILLARY>She is captain of the cheer squad.

966
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:01,440
<41-23,HILLARY>她深知怎么爬到金字塔的顶端
<41-23,HILLARY>She knows her way to the top of the pyramid.

967
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:09,790
<42-1,CASTLE>卢卡斯的下场将会如何
<42-1,CASTLE>So, what's gonna happen to Lucas?

968
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,890
<42-2,BECKETT>他唯一的罪行就是破门入室
<42-2,BECKETT>Well, I mean, his only crime was

969
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:15,530
<42-2,BECKETT>其中的失物本是赃物  借此机会反而物归原主了
<42-2,BECKETT>a B&E in which stolen goods were stolen and since recovered,

970
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:17,090
<42-2,BECKETT>所以他不会被起诉
<42-2,BECKETT>so he'll keep his freedom.

971
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:20,420
<42-3,DUNAN>我们也会保留他的奖学金  只不过这学期
<42-3,DUNAN>And his scholarship, although he will be on probation

972
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:21,870
<42-3,DUNAN>他将留校察看
<42-3,DUNAN>for the remainder of the term.

973
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:24,110
<42-4,CASTLE>还真是宽大仁慈啊
<42-4,CASTLE>Leniency, huh?

974
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:27,180
<42-4,CASTLE>很高兴见到现如今学校的领导层
<42-4,CASTLE>Well, nice to see that the administration

975
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:29,800
<42-4,CASTLE>比我读书那会有人情味的多
<42-4,CASTLE>has more compassion now than they did in my day.

976
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,150
<42-5,DUNAN>我想知道一件事  卡塞尔先生
<42-5,DUNAN>There's one thing I need to know, Mr. Castle.

977
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,740
<42-5,DUNAN>这件事我已经琢磨了很多年了
<42-5,DUNAN>It's haunted me for years.

978
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:37,750
<42-5,DUNAN>你们是从哪弄来那头奶牛的
<42-5,DUNAN>Where did you get the cow?

979
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,150
<42-6,CASTLE>这么说吧  先生
<42-6,CASTLE>Put it this way, sir --

980
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:44,450
<42-6,CASTLE>如果你想要的话  我认识个熟人可以帮你
<42-6,CASTLE>if you ever need one, I know a guy.

981
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,230
<42-7,DUNAN>好了  看着点路
<42-7,DUNAN>All right, where do you think you're going?

982
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:53,380
<42-8,BECKETT>他们看起来玩得很开心啊
<42-8,BECKETT>They look like they're having fun.

983
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:55,390
<42-8,BECKETT>是啊
<42-8,BECKETT>Yeah.

984
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,880
<42-9,CASTLE>我知道你很叛逆  你不喜欢跟风
<42-9,CASTLE>Listen, I know you're a rebel and you hate convention

985
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,380
<42-9,CASTLE>之类之类的  但是
<42-9,CASTLE>and blah, blah, blah, but...

986
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,770
<42-9,CASTLE>凯特  你愿不愿意
<42-9,CASTLE>Kate, would you, uh...

987
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:09,270
<42-9,CASTLE>和我一同参加舞会
<42-9,CASTLE>will you go to the dance with me?

988
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:18,570
<42-9,CASTLE>*你流淌在我的血液中  我无法将你忘怀*
<42-9,CASTLE>*Oh, you're in my veins and I cannot get you out*

989
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:26,110
<42-9,CASTLE>*整晚我嘴里尝到的都是你的味道*
<42-9,CASTLE>*Oh, you're all I taste at night inside of my mouth*

990
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:27,180
<43-1,BECKETT>你后悔吗
<43-1,BECKETT>Do you regret it --

991
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:30,500
<43-1,BECKETT>搞了那场恶作剧  错过了你的毕业舞会
<43-1,BECKETT>that prank, missing your prom,

992
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,520
<43-1,BECKETT>没能跟奥德拉·道伯森一起跳舞
<43-1,BECKETT>not being here with Audra Dobson?

993
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:33,900
<43-2,CASTLE>一点都不后悔
<43-2,CASTLE>Not even a little bit.

994
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:39,170
<43-2,CASTLE>我所做过的每件事  每个选择
<43-2,CASTLE>Everything I've ever done, every choice I've ever made,

995
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:42,770
<43-2,CASTLE>发生在我身上的每一件
<43-2,CASTLE>every...terrible and wonderful thing

996
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:43,980
<43-2,CASTLE>坏事和好事
<43-2,CASTLE>that's ever happened to me --

997
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:46,300
<43-2,CASTLE>这一切都是为了引领我走到今天
<43-2,CASTLE>it's all led me to right here,

998
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,990
<43-2,CASTLE>这一刻在这里  和你在一起
<43-2,CASTLE>this moment, with you.

999
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,510
<43-3,CASTLE>*一切都不同了*
<43-3,CASTLE>*Nothing stays the same*

1000
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:57,140
<43-3,CASTLE>我一直很喜欢这首歌
<43-3,CASTLE>I've always loved this song.

1001
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,120
<43-5,CASTLE>我们是不是已经找到了属于我们的歌
<43-5,CASTLE>Could it be we just found our song?

1002
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:01,520
<43-5,CASTLE>*人无完人*
<43-5,CASTLE>*Nobody here's perfect*

1003
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:05,480
<43-6,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<43-6,BECKETT>Castle.

1004
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:18,700
<43-6,BECKETT>*你依赖的一切*
<43-6,BECKETT>*Oh, all that you rely on*

1005
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:21,430
<43-6,BECKETT>*一切*
<43-6,BECKETT>*O-o-on*

1006
