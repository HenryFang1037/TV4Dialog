54
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:00,220
<1-1,KATE BECKETT>杰森  你来这小巷做什么
<1-1,KATE BECKETT>What are you doing in an alley, Jason?

58
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:03,750
<2-1,BECKETT>芝加哥咋样呀
<2-1,BECKETT>How's Chicago?

59
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,180
<2-2,RICHARD CASTLE>很棒  猜猜发生了什么
<2-2,RICHARD CASTLE>Great. So, guess what happened?

60
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,750
<2-3,BECKETT>你因为举办疯狂派对被逐出宾馆
<2-3,BECKETT>You were kicked out of the hotel for throwing a crazy party.

61
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,320
<2-4,CASTLE>当年多美好呀
<2-4,CASTLE>Those were the days.

62
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,940
<2-4,CASTLE>不是  他们将余下的德里克·斯道姆系列
<2-4,CASTLE>No, they moved the rest of the dates

63
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:14,000
<2-4,CASTLE>签售时间安排在了婚礼之后
<2-4,CASTLE>of the Derrick Storm book tour to after the wedding.

64
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:15,100
<2-4,CASTLE>你知道这意味着什么
<2-4,CASTLE>So you know what that means?

65
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,550
<2-4,CASTLE>我要回家啦
<2-4,CASTLE>I'm coming home.

66
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,030
<2-5,CASTLE>好歹表现点喜悦之情呀
<2-5,CASTLE>Try to contain your excitement.

67
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:20,590
<2-5,CASTLE>抱歉
<2-5,CASTLE>I'm sorry.

68
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:23,420
<2-6,BECKETT>我是缺乏睡眠  不是缺乏激情
<2-6,BECKETT>That was lack of sleep, not lack of enthusiasm.

69
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:25,790
<2-6,BECKETT>我昨晚忙活我们的"项目"来着
<2-6,BECKETT>I just -- I was working on our...project.

70
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:28,100
<2-7,CASTLE>你出去了  独自一人
<2-7,CASTLE>You went out? Alone?

71
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:30,750
<2-7,CASTLE>你知道有多危险啊
<2-7,CASTLE>You know how dangerous this is.

72
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,030
<2-8,BECKETT>我很小心的
<2-8,BECKETT>Yeah. I was careful.

73
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,380
<2-8,BECKETT>我没有选择
<2-8,BECKETT>And I didn't have a choice.

74
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,170
<2-8,BECKETT>杰森·马科斯回城了
<2-8,BECKETT>Jason Marks came back to town.

75
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:38,410
<2-8,BECKETT>他在12大街被一辆黑色林肯城市接走
<2-8,BECKETT>He got picked up on 12th Street by a black town car

76
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:39,640
<2-8,BECKETT>去进行深夜密会
<2-8,BECKETT>for a late-night meet.

77
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,240
<2-9,CASTLE>和谁
<2-9,CASTLE>With whom?

78
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,990
<2-10,BECKETT>我不知道  我没跟去
<2-10,BECKETT>I don't know. I backed off.

79
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,910
<2-10,BECKETT>看  我没有鲁莽行事吧
<2-10,BECKETT>See? I was being responsible.

80
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:47,450
<2-11,CASTLE>不  叫增援才算不鲁莽
<2-11,CASTLE>No, being responsible means taking backup.

81
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,110
<2-11,CASTLE>也许该让莱恩和埃斯波西托
<2-11,CASTLE>Maybe it's time we brought Ryan and Esposito

82
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:50,120
<2-11,CASTLE>也一起来调查了
<2-11,CASTLE>into the loop on this.

83
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,730
<2-12,BECKETT>不要  我不能让他们拿工作冒险
<2-12,BECKETT>No, I'm not putting their careers at risk, too.

84
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,980
<2-12,BECKETT>有工作  我得走了
<2-12,BECKETT>Hey, that's work. I have to go.

85
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:59,410
<2-12,BECKETT>旅途平安  好吗
<2-12,BECKETT>Listen, have a safe flight, okay?

86
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:00,420
<2-12,BECKETT>我爱你
<2-12,BECKETT>I love you.

87
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,210
<2-13,CASTLE>好的  我更爱你
<2-13,CASTLE>Yeah, well, you better.

88
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,380
<2-13,CASTLE>距婚礼只有两周
<2-13,CASTLE>It's two weeks till the wedding,

89
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,700
<2-13,CASTLE>也来不及归还礼服了
<2-13,CASTLE>and it's too late to return the tux.

91
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,010
<3-1,KEVIN RYAN>一名清洁工早晨五点左右
<3-1,KEVIN RYAN>A street sweeper found the body

92
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:13,760
<3-1,KEVIN RYAN>发现了尸体  并报了警
<3-1,KEVIN RYAN>and called it in around 5:00 A.M.

93
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,110
<3-2,BECKETT>被害人有钱包吗
<3-2,BECKETT>Did the victim have a wallet?

94
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:17,590
<3-3,RYAN>有  名字叫杰森·马科斯
<3-3,RYAN>Yeah. His name is Jason Marks.

95
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:19,630
<3-4,RYAN>根据他钱包里的名片
<3-4,RYAN>According to the business card in his wallet,

96
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:23,480
<3-4,RYAN>他在华盛顿区的K街有一家政治顾问公司
<3-4,RYAN>he runs a political-consulting firm on K Street in D.C.

97
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,160
<3-4,RYAN>没事吧
<3-4,RYAN>You okay?

98
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,670
<3-5,BECKETT>没事  没事
<3-5,BECKETT>Yeah. Yeah, fine.

99
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:30,630
<3-5,BECKETT>公司那边说他来城里干什么了吗
<3-5,BECKETT>So, did the firm say what he was doing in town?

100
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,440
<3-6,RYAN>还没有  我留了个口讯
<3-6,RYAN>Oh, no, not yet. I left a message.

101
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,400
<3-6,RYAN>还没有回音
<3-6,RYAN>Still haven't heard back yet.

102
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:34,940
<3-7,BECKETT>他是被枪杀的
<3-7,BECKETT>So, he was shot?

103
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:36,480
<3-8,LANIE PARISH>胸部中两枪
<3-8,LANIE PARISH>Double tap to the chest.

104
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,700
<3-8,LANIE PARISH>并且是近距离射击
<3-8,LANIE PARISH>At close range, too.

105
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:39,200
<3-9,BECKETT>推测出死亡时间了吗
<3-9,BECKETT>Get what time?

106
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,780
<3-10,LANIE>我估计是在午夜12点至2点之间
<3-10,LANIE>I'm guessing between 12:00 and 2:00 A.M.

107
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,300
<3-11,BECKETT>这里没有多少血迹
<3-11,BECKETT>Well, there's not a lot of blood,

108
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,170
<3-11,BECKETT>他一定是在其他地方遇害
<3-11,BECKETT>so he must have been killed someplace else.

109
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:50,140
<3-12,LANIE>然后把尸体丢在了这里
<3-12,LANIE>Then they brought his body here and dumped it.

110
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,510
<3-13,BECKETT>莱恩  有目击者吗
<3-13,BECKETT>Ryan, were there any witnesses --

111
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,170
<3-13,BECKETT>有人看到有车开走吗
<3-13,BECKETT>anyone that saw a car driving away?

112
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:55,270
<3-14,RYAN>还没  不过盘查才刚开始
<3-14,RYAN>Not yet, but I just started the canvass.

113
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,680
<3-15,BECKETT>把交通监控调出来
<3-15,BECKETT>Okay, let's take a look at the traffic cam,

114
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,010
<3-15,BECKETT>看当时有没有其他人在巷子里
<3-15,BECKETT>see if we can figure out who else was in this alleyway.

115
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,580
<3-16,JAVIER ESPOSITO>我已经在找了
<3-16,JAVIER ESPOSITO>Actually, I'm already on that.

116
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,180
<3-16,JAVIER ESPOSITO>我把17大街翻了个遍
<3-16,JAVIER ESPOSITO>I've been all up and down 17th street.

117
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,090
<3-16,JAVIER ESPOSITO>没有一个监控  不过我已经在调两个街区内的
<3-16,JAVIER ESPOSITO>There are no cameras, but I'm pulling all traffic video

118
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,330
<3-16,JAVIER ESPOSITO>所有交通监控录像了
<3-16,JAVIER ESPOSITO>in a two-block radius.

119
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,490
<3-17,BECKETT>这样吧
<3-17,BECKETT>You know what? Um...

121
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:11,740
<3-17,BECKETT>把半径扩大到五个街区
<3-17,BECKETT>Why don't we extend that to a five-block radius?

122
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,780
<3-18,RYAN>五个  平常都是两个啊
<3-18,RYAN>Five? We usually only do two.

123
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,860
<3-19,BECKETT>我知道  就当是直觉吧
<3-19,BECKETT>Yeah. I -- you know, just call it a hunch.

124
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:17,860
<3-20,RYAN>好吧
<3-20,RYAN>All right.

125
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:18,850
<3-21,BECKETT>分局见
<3-21,BECKETT>I'll see you guys at the precinct.

126
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,510
<3-21,BECKETT>我还有事要处理
<3-21,BECKETT>I have to go and take care of something.

128
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:31,660
<4-2,CASTLE>-可恶  -理查德·卡塞尔  请留言
<4-2,CASTLE>- Damn. - This is Richard Castle. Leave me a message.

129
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,140
<4-3,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你还在飞机上吧
<4-3,BECKETT>Hey, Castle. You're probably still in the air.

130
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,360
<4-3,BECKETT>落地后直接来分局
<4-3,BECKETT>Listen, when you land, come straight to the precinct.

131
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,470
<4-3,BECKETT>出事了
<4-3,BECKETT>Something's happened.

132
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:38,290
<4-3,BECKETT>贝克特
<4-3,BECKETT>Hey, Beckett.

133
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:40,320
<5-1,RYAN>-你还好吗  -还好
<5-1,RYAN>- You good? - Yeah.

134
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:44,460
<5-2,BECKETT>杰森·马科斯的公司找到线索了吗
<5-2,BECKETT>Did you get anything from Jason Marks' office?

135
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,780
<5-3,RYAN>我去了  他们根本不知道他回来了
<5-3,RYAN>Yeah. They had no idea that he was in town,

136
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,900
<5-3,RYAN>连家人也不知道
<5-3,RYAN>neither did his family.

137
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:48,780
<5-3,RYAN>不管他回来要做什么
<5-3,RYAN>Whatever he was doing here,

138
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,210
<5-3,RYAN>绝对是个秘密
<5-3,RYAN>he was keeping it on the down-low.

139
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,450
<5-3,RYAN>不过我们发现
<5-3,RYAN>But we did find out

140
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:53,490
<5-3,RYAN>他住在市中心一家旅馆
<5-3,RYAN>that Marks was staying at a hotel in midtown.

141
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,680
<5-3,RYAN>正在查他在旅馆期间
<5-3,RYAN>We're checking to see whether he had any guests

142
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,480
<5-3,RYAN>有无访客和出入电话情况
<5-3,RYAN>or made any phone calls while he was there.

143
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:00,290
<5-4,ESPOSITO>我找到的线索比那好多了
<5-4,ESPOSITO>I just found something a whole lot hotter than that.

144
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,640
<5-4,ESPOSITO>按你说的  我调查了五个街区内的监控
<5-4,ESPOSITO>I pulled footage from a five-block radius, like you asked.

145
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,660
<5-4,ESPOSITO>你的直觉太准了
<5-4,ESPOSITO>Turned out to be a hell of a hunch.

146
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,880
<5-4,ESPOSITO>12大街的一个监控拍到了马科斯在一辆林肯里
<5-4,ESPOSITO>A camera off 12th caught marks in a town car.

147
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:08,380
<5-4,ESPOSITO>看看是谁开的
<5-4,ESPOSITO>Look who's driving.

148
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,690
<5-5,BECKETT>瓦肯·西蒙斯
<5-5,BECKETT>Vulcan Simmons.

149
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:16,070
<5-6,RYAN>如果这照片是
<5-6,RYAN>If this picture was taken

150
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:18,660
<5-6,RYAN>凌晨1点16在离案发现场5街区处拍的
<5-6,RYAN>five blocks from the crime scene at 1:16 a.M.,

151
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:21,420
<5-6,RYAN>说明马科斯很可能是不久后被杀的
<5-6,RYAN>it means that Marks was probably killed just a few minutes later.

152
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,510
<5-6,RYAN>说不定哪个监控拍拍到了瓦肯开枪
<5-6,RYAN>Maybe there's some other video of Vulcan pulling the trigger.

153
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:25,430
<5-7,ESPOSITO>没有  我一直追踪他到15大街
<5-7,ESPOSITO>There isn't -- I was able to track him to 15th Street

154
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,790
<5-7,ESPOSITO>但是之后就没有监控了
<5-7,ESPOSITO>but there's no coverage after that.

155
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:28,650
<5-8,RYAN>瓦肯·西蒙斯这种毒枭
<5-8,RYAN>What's a drug lord like Vulcan Simmons

156
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:31,450
<5-8,RYAN>为什么会和特区的政治顾问有瓜葛
<5-8,RYAN>doing mixed up with a D.C. political consultant, anyway?

157
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,690
<6-1,BECKETT>六周  卡塞尔
<6-1,BECKETT>Six weeks, Castle.

158
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:43,180
<6-1,BECKETT>我们追查了瓦肯·西蒙斯六周
<6-1,BECKETT>Six weeks following Vulcan Simmons,

159
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,370
<6-1,BECKETT>希望能有些许线索
<6-1,BECKETT>hoping for a lead.

160
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:47,510
<6-1,BECKETT>刚刚找到连接他和布莱肯的关键人物
<6-1,BECKETT>And when we finally find someone that connects him to Bracken,

161
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,380
<6-1,BECKETT>这人就死在了小巷里
<6-1,BECKETT>the guy ends up dead in an alley?

162
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,590
<6-2,CASTLE>如果杰森·马科斯是瓦肯的赃款和
<6-2,CASTLE>If Jason Marks is the conduit between Vulcan's drug money

163
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:55,000
<6-2,CASTLE>布莱肯议员总统大选的导管
<6-2,CASTLE>and senator Bracken's presidential campaign,

164
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:56,040
<6-2,CASTLE>他们为什么要杀他
<6-2,CASTLE>why would they kill him?

165
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,620
<6-2,CASTLE>情况有变
<6-2,CASTLE>Something's changed.

166
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:00,370
<6-3,BECKETT>也许这是布莱肯的防御措施
<6-3,BECKETT>Maybe Bracken's firewalling himself again --

167
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,690
<6-3,BECKETT>要在牵扯出自己之前抹杀证据
<6-3,BECKETT>erasing all of the dots before they connect back to him.

168
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:07,070
<6-3,BECKETT>我们得在线索断掉前行动了
<6-3,BECKETT>We have to move fast before those dots disappear.

169
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:10,330
<6-4,CASTLE>不行  我们说好了的  不能冒险
<6-4,CASTLE>No. We talked about this -- no unnecessary risks.

170
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,860
<6-5,BECKETT>我绝不要看着谋杀我母亲的凶手
<6-5,BECKETT>I'm not gonna stand by while my mother's murderer

171
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,960
<6-5,BECKETT>成为美国总统
<6-5,BECKETT>becomes president of the United States.

172
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,130
<6-6,CASTLE>也许不会如此
<6-6,CASTLE>Maybe you won't have to.

173
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,220
<6-6,CASTLE>我们把马科斯的死看成了阻碍
<6-6,CASTLE>We've been looking at Marks' death like it's a setback.

174
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,740
<6-6,CASTLE>也许这正是我们需要的转机呢
<6-6,CASTLE>What if it's the breakthrough we need?

175
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:21,810
<6-7,BECKETT>什么意思
<6-7,BECKETT>What do you mean?

176
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,250
<6-8,CASTLE>瓦肯·西蒙斯成了一桩谋杀案的
<6-8,CASTLE>Vulcan Simmons just became the prime suspect

177
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,860
<6-8,CASTLE>头号嫌疑人
<6-8,CASTLE>in a murder investigation.

178
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,420
<6-8,CASTLE>你就可以彻查他的过去
<6-8,CASTLE>You've been given an all-access pass to his life.

179
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,510
<6-8,CASTLE>只要我们出好牌  你就能定他的罪
<6-8,CASTLE>We play our cards right, you nail him with this...

180
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:33,150
<6-9,BECKETT>他就可能供出布莱肯
<6-9,BECKETT>He might roll on Bracken.

181
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:36,120
<6-10,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>探长  请来我的办公室
<6-10,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>Detective? My office, please.

182
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,900
<7-1,BECKETT>长官  你不能这样做
<7-1,BECKETT>No, sir, you can't do this.

183
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:45,030
<7-1,BECKETT>你不能让我放弃这个案子
<7-1,BECKETT>You can't take me off this case.

184
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,510
<7-1,BECKETT>没人比我更了解瓦肯·西蒙斯
<7-1,BECKETT>Nobody knows Vulcan Simmons like I do.

185
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,260
<7-2,GATES>也没人像你这样和他有这么深的过节
<7-2,GATES>And no one has a history with him like you do.

186
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:53,320
<7-2,GATES>他的律师会指责我们公报私仇
<7-2,GATES>His lawyers will spin it as a personal vendetta.

187
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,840
<7-2,GATES>西蒙斯先生正被带来问话
<7-2,GATES>Now, Mr. Simmons is being brought in for questioning,

188
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,810
<7-2,GATES>最好不要让他见到你
<7-2,GATES>and it's best that you're not here when he shows up.

189
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:01,190
<7-3,BECKETT>长官  我需要办这个案子
<7-3,BECKETT>Sir, I need to be a part of this case.

190
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:02,080
<7-3,BECKETT>我懂
<7-3,BECKETT>I know.

191
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:04,080
<7-4,GATES>但是不行
<7-4,GATES>But you can't be.

192
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,980
<7-4,GATES>休假半天  探长
<7-4,GATES>Take the rest of the day off, detective.

193
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:08,680
<7-4,GATES>这是命令
<7-4,GATES>That's an order.

194
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:14,960
<8-1,BECKETT>这辆车是关键
<8-1,BECKETT>This car's the key.

195
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,990
<8-1,BECKETT>如果瓦肯在车上杀掉了马科斯
<8-1,BECKETT>If that's where Vulcan killed Marks,

196
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:19,730
<8-1,BECKETT>我们就能在车上找到足够证据
<8-1,BECKETT>then we'll find the forensic evidence in it.

197
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,500
<8-1,BECKETT>除了供出布莱肯  他将别无选择
<8-1,BECKETT>He'll have no choice but to cut a deal and give up Bracken.

198
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:25,220
<8-1,BECKETT>我们很接近了  卡塞尔  我能感觉到
<8-1,BECKETT>It's just that we're so close, Castle. I can feel it.

199
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,820
<8-1,BECKETT>但是我们需要找到那辆车
<8-1,BECKETT>But we need to find that car.

200
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,020
<8-2,CASTLE>莱恩和埃斯波西托正在全力调查
<8-2,CASTLE>Ryan and Esposito are all over this.

201
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,070
<8-2,CASTLE>你也知道的  对吧
<8-2,CASTLE>You know that, right?

202
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:35,250
<8-3,BECKETT>分局来的
<8-3,BECKETT>It's the precinct.

203
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:37,200
<8-3,BECKETT>怎么样了
<8-3,BECKETT>Hey. How'd it go?

204
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,870
<8-4,RYAN>我们得释放瓦肯了
<8-4,RYAN>We had to cut Vulcan loose.

205
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:39,500
<8-5,BECKETT>什么
<8-5,BECKETT>What?!

206
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:41,900
<8-5,BECKETT>怎么回事
<8-5,BECKETT>What happened?

207
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:44,550
<8-6,RYAN>他的律师声称照片上的人不是他
<8-6,RYAN>His lawyers are claiming that it's not him in that photo.

208
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:46,400
<8-6,RYAN>而且瓦肯也没有任何车辆登记
<8-6,RYAN>And since Vulcan doesn't have any vehicles

209
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,980
<8-6,RYAN>在他名下  我们没有证据
<8-6,RYAN>registered to his name, we can't prove that it is.

210
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:53,140
<8-7,BECKETT>莱恩  听着  你得在他销毁
<8-7,BECKETT>Ryan, listen to me -- you have to seize that town car

211
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:55,540
<8-7,BECKETT>一切凶案证据之前找到那辆林肯
<8-7,BECKETT>before he gets rid of all of the evidence of the murder.

212
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:58,790
<8-8,RYAN>我们会尽力的  但他没有任何记录
<8-8,RYAN>Well, we would if we could, but the man has no paper trail.

213
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,350
<8-8,RYAN>我们查不到他住在哪里
<8-8,RYAN>We can't even figure out where he lives,

214
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:01,970
<8-8,RYAN>更别说他把车藏在哪
<8-8,RYAN>let alone where he keeps that car.

219
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:18,910
<9-1,VULCAN SIMMONS>得罪了个姑娘  她就永远记恨你
<9-1,VULCAN SIMMONS>Get a girl's hair wet and they never let it go.

220
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,640
<9-2,SIMMONS>你不会开枪的  探长
<9-2,SIMMONS>You are not going to shoot me, detective.

221
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,320
<9-2,SIMMONS>不会吗
<9-2,SIMMONS>No?

222
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,430
<9-3,BECKETT>再走一步试试
<9-3,BECKETT>Then take another step!

223
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:33,090
<9-4,SIMMONS>我死在这
<9-4,SIMMONS>Me laying dead?

224
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,130
<9-4,SIMMONS>你擅自闯入这里
<9-4,SIMMONS>You here trespassing?

225
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:37,300
<9-4,SIMMONS>而且你还带着血海深仇
<9-4,SIMMONS>With that big ol' grudge you carry?

226
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:41,100
<9-4,SIMMONS>你的上司都会怎么想
<9-4,SIMMONS>What are your bosses gonna say to that?

227
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:44,110
<9-5,BECKETT>你杀了杰森·马科斯
<9-5,BECKETT>You killed Jason Marks,

228
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,330
<9-5,BECKETT>车里的血迹就是证据
<9-5,BECKETT>and the blood in the car is gonna prove it.

229
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:48,400
<9-6,SIMMONS>那幸好你有搜查令
<9-6,SIMMONS>Well, then, it's a good thing you have a warrant.

230
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:54,080
<9-6,SIMMONS>你拿到搜查令了吧  探长
<9-6,SIMMONS>You do have a warrant, don't you, detective?

231
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:58,420
<9-6,SIMMONS>这真是可惜
<9-6,SIMMONS>Aw. Now, see, that's a shame.

232
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,050
<9-6,SIMMONS>因为现在这个证据
<9-6,SIMMONS>Because now all that evidence

233
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:04,550
<9-6,SIMMONS>已经是非法取得而不能被采纳
<9-6,SIMMONS>has become fruit of the poisoned tree.

234
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:06,930
<9-6,SIMMONS>我和我的律师真得谢谢你
<9-6,SIMMONS>My lawyers and I thank you.

235
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,440
<9-7,BECKETT>谁指使你的
<9-7,BECKETT>Who do you work for?

236
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:11,560
<9-8,SIMMONS>这一局你输了  探长
<9-8,SIMMONS>You lost this round, detective.

237
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,220
<9-8,SIMMONS>走吧
<9-8,SIMMONS>Now run along.

238
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:17,020
<9-9,BECKETT>没找到答案我是不会走的
<9-9,BECKETT>Not until I get some answers.

239
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:28,690
<10-1,CASTLE>你好
<10-1,CASTLE>Yeah, hello?

240
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,990
<10-2,ESPOSITO>是我埃斯波西托  贝克特和你在一起吗
<10-2,ESPOSITO>Yo. It's Espo. Is Beckett with you?

241
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,450
<10-3,CASTLE>怎么了  发生什么事了
<10-3,CASTLE>Why? What's going on?

242
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:37,420
<10-4,ESPOSITO>盖茨让她回来查瓦肯·西蒙斯的案子
<10-4,ESPOSITO>Well, Gates is putting her back on the Vulcan Simmons investigation.

243
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:38,610
<10-4,ESPOSITO>是吗
<10-4,ESPOSITO>She is?

244
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:42,030
<10-5,CASTLE>她不是不想让贝克特和他正面交锋吗
<10-5,CASTLE>I thought she didn't want Beckett going toe-to-toe with him.

245
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:43,820
<10-6,ESPOSITO>这个问题不存在了
<10-6,ESPOSITO>That's not gonna be an issue anymore.

246
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,290
<10-6,ESPOSITO>瓦肯·西蒙斯被杀了
<10-6,ESPOSITO>Vulcan Simmons has been murdered.

256
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:13,240
<11-1,CASTLE>今天早上你去哪了
<11-1,CASTLE>Hey. Where were you this morning?

257
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,760
<11-2,BECKETT>回头说
<11-2,BECKETT>Uh...not now.

258
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:19,300
<11-2,BECKETT>什么情况
<11-2,BECKETT>What do we think happened?

259
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,990
<11-2,BECKETT>有人折磨了他
<11-2,BECKETT>Someone tortured the man.

260
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,840
<12-1,BECKETT>根据血流特征
<12-1,BECKETT>Based on blood patterns,

261
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,480
<12-2,GATES>他半个小时内被枪击中了五次
<12-2,GATES>he was shot five times over a span of a half an hour.

262
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:29,120
<12-3,LANIE>凶手先击中了膝盖  然后是肩膀
<12-3,LANIE>So the killer started at the knees, then shoulders,

263
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,310
<12-3,LANIE>最后一击致命  穿过了心脏
<12-3,LANIE>and finally, a fatal round through the heart.

264
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:33,890
<12-4,GATES>看上去凶手可能是在审问他
<12-4,GATES>It seems like the shooter may have interrogated him --

265
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:36,630
<12-4,GATES>折磨他来获取信息
<12-4,GATES>Inflicting pain to get information, perhaps.

266
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:38,590
<12-5,BECKETT>法医证据呢
<12-5,BECKETT>What about forensic evidence?

267
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:40,700
<12-6,LANIE>没有太多可查的  凶手非常小心
<12-6,LANIE>Not much to go on -- our killer was careful,

268
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:42,750
<12-6,LANIE>捡走了打出的弹壳
<12-6,LANIE>picked up the spent shell casings.

269
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:43,640
<12-7,CASTLE>弹道匹配呢
<12-7,CASTLE>How about ballistics?

270
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,760
<12-8,LANIE>要还原子弹不太可能
<12-8,LANIE>It doesn't look like I'll be able to recover the bullets.

271
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:46,810
<12-9,CASTLE>是因为损坏太严重了吗
<12-9,CASTLE>Because they're too damaged?

272
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:47,840
<12-10,LANIE>因为它们不见了
<12-10,LANIE>Because they're gone.

273
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,400
<12-10,LANIE>杀害他的人把子弹从尸体里取出来了
<12-10,LANIE>Whoever did this, dug them out of the body.

274
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,760
<12-11,GATES>也就是说  凶手知道
<12-11,GATES>In other words, the killer knew

275
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,970
<12-11,GATES>我们会调查什么于是掩盖了痕迹
<12-11,GATES>what we'd look for and covered their tracks.

276
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,820
<12-11,GATES>你了解瓦肯的一切
<12-11,GATES>You know Vulcan's world.

277
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,970
<12-11,GATES>能想到是谁干的吗
<12-11,GATES>Any idea who might have done this?

278
00:12:58,970 --> 00:12:59,730
<12-12,BECKETT>不能  长官
<12-12,BECKETT>No, sir.

279
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,750
<12-12,BECKETT>有目击者吗
<12-12,BECKETT>Do we have any witnesses?

280
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,360
<12-13,GATES>目前还没有找到
<12-13,GATES>Not that we've found so far.

281
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:05,860
<12-13,GATES>但是我们找到了西蒙斯先生开的车
<12-13,GATES>But we did find the car Mr. Simmons was driving,

282
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:09,130
<12-13,GATES>里面还有血迹  应该是杰森·马科斯的
<12-13,GATES>and there's blood inside -- most likely from Jason Marks.

283
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:09,950
<12-13,GATES>跟我来
<12-13,GATES>I'll show you.

284
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:11,980
<12-14,RYAN>卡塞尔
<12-14,RYAN>Hey, Castle.

285
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:13,410
<12-14,RYAN>有时间吗
<12-14,RYAN>Got a sec?

286
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:15,440
<12-15,CASTLE>怎么啦
<12-15,CASTLE>What's up?

287
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:17,160
<12-16,ESPOSITO>我们刚刚盘问了一下
<12-16,ESPOSITO>We were just canvassing.

288
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,710
<12-16,ESPOSITO>有一个目击者说他们昨晚看到有人在这
<12-16,ESPOSITO>We spoke to a witness who said they saw someone here last night.

289
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,500
<12-17,RYAN>一个女人偷偷溜了进来
<12-17,RYAN>A woman sneaking onto the property.

290
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,860
<12-17,RYAN>据目击者描述她高挑  深色头发
<12-17,RYAN>Witness described her as "A tall brunette,

291
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:25,820
<12-17,RYAN>长得很好看不像是这附近的人
<12-17,RYAN>too good-looking to be in this neighborhood."

292
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:29,720
<13-1,BECKETT>是的  我在那
<13-1,BECKETT>Yes. I was there.

293
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:31,840
<13-1,BECKETT>可我没有杀他
<13-1,BECKETT>But I didn't kill him.

294
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:34,850
<13-1,BECKETT>不过我想过
<13-1,BECKETT>I thought about it, though.

295
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:36,570
<13-2,CASTLE>你怎么回事  凯特  我们说好了的
<13-2,CASTLE>What the hell, Kate? We had a deal.

296
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:37,850
<13-2,CASTLE>你为什么没跟我说
<13-2,CASTLE>Why didn't you tell me?

297
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,280
<13-3,BECKETT>我知道你不会让我去的
<13-3,BECKETT>I knew you wouldn't let me go.

298
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,970
<13-4,CASTLE>我当然不会  这太莽撞了
<13-4,CASTLE>You're damn right. I wouldn't risk reckless.

299
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:43,460
<13-5,BECKETT>我估计到了风险
<13-5,BECKETT>It was a calculated risk.

300
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,970
<13-5,BECKETT>我不能让瓦肯逃走
<13-5,BECKETT>I couldn't let Vulcan slip away.

301
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:48,130
<13-5,BECKETT>只是我的速度不够快
<13-5,BECKETT>Only, I didn't move fast enough.

302
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:50,410
<13-6,CASTLE>那昨晚发生了什么
<13-6,CASTLE>So, what happened last night?

303
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,910
<13-7,BECKETT>他在阴暗处等着
<13-7,BECKETT>He was in the shadows. He was waiting.

304
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:57,410
<13-7,BECKETT>他好像知道我会去
<13-7,BECKETT>It's like he knew I was coming.

305
00:13:57,890 --> 00:13:58,920
<13-7,BECKETT>我们说了几句话
<13-7,BECKETT>And we had words.

306
00:13:59,170 --> 00:13:59,740
<13-7,BECKETT>就这样
<13-7,BECKETT>That's it.

307
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:02,560
<13-7,BECKETT>我走的时候他还活着
<13-7,BECKETT>He was alive when I left.

308
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:04,680
<13-8,CASTLE>你没有看到其他人吗
<13-8,CASTLE>And you didn't see anyone else?

309
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,860
<13-9,BECKETT>没有  只有他
<13-9,BECKETT>No. Just him.

310
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:12,370
<13-10,CASTLE>凯特  你不能告诉任何人你去过车库
<13-10,CASTLE>Kate, you absolutely cannot tell anyone you were at that garage.

311
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:13,100
<13-11,BECKETT>我知道
<13-11,BECKETT>I know.

312
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:24,180
<13-12,CASTLE>他们是谁
<13-12,CASTLE>Who are they?

313
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,590
<13-13,BECKETT>那个走在前面的是多诺万警监
<13-13,BECKETT>The guy in the front is captain Donovan.

314
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:28,200
<13-13,BECKETT>内务部的
<13-13,BECKETT>He's internal affairs.

315
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:31,020
<13-13,BECKETT>盖茨调到这后  就是他接任
<13-13,BECKETT>He took over after Gates transferred here.

316
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,640
<13-13,BECKETT>他来这里干什么
<13-13,BECKETT>What's he doing here?

317
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,530
<13-13,BECKETT>蕾妮  你好
<13-13,BECKETT>Lanie? Hey.

318
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,250
<13-14,LANIE>凯特  有麻烦了
<13-14,LANIE>Kate, we have a problem.

319
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:41,790
<13-15,BECKETT>怎么了
<13-15,BECKETT>What's wrong?

320
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,090
<13-16,LANIE>我在瓦肯的尸体里找到一发子弹
<13-16,LANIE>I found a bullet in Vulcan's body,

321
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:46,490
<13-16,LANIE>打在在脊柱里
<13-16,LANIE>Lodged in his spine

322
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,460
<13-16,LANIE>是一颗40毫米的子弹
<13-16,LANIE>a .40 caliber.

323
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:50,010
<13-16,LANIE>凶手一定是没看见这颗子弹
<13-16,LANIE>Killer must have missed it.

324
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,570
<13-17,BECKETT>这会有什么麻烦
<13-17,BECKETT>How is that a problem?

325
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:52,940
<13-17,BECKETT>如果弹道测试找到匹配的枪  那么...
<13-17,BECKETT>If ballistics gets a match, then...

326
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,720
<13-18,LANIE>的确找到了匹配的枪
<13-18,LANIE>Ballistics did get a match.

327
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:58,910
<13-18,LANIE>射出这颗子弹的手枪登记在你的名下
<13-18,LANIE>The bullet came from a pistol that was registered to you.

328
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,000
<13-18,LANIE>凯特
<13-18,LANIE>Kate...

329
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,590
<13-18,LANIE>瓦肯·西蒙斯是被你的枪杀死的
<13-18,LANIE>Vulcan Simmons... was killed with your gun.

330
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,330
<13-19,CASTLE>怎么可能会是你的枪
<13-19,CASTLE>How could it be from your gun?

331
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:12,450
<13-19,CASTLE>你的枪在你这
<13-19,CASTLE>You have your gun.

332
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,410
<13-20,BECKETT>那是我的备用枪
<13-20,BECKETT>That's my backup piece.

333
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,710
<13-20,BECKETT>我家里的保险柜里有一把40毫米口径的枪
<13-20,BECKETT>I have a .40 cal in my safe at home.

334
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:20,780
<13-21,CASTLE>你被陷害了
<13-21,CASTLE>You're being set up.

335
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:24,560
<14-1,GATES>我看了弹道测试报告  马库斯  肯定弄错了
<14-1,GATES>I see what the ballistics report says, Marcus, but it's wrong.

336
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,710
<14-1,GATES>贝克特探长绝对不会做出这种事
<14-1,GATES>Detective Beckett would never do anything like this.

337
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:28,260
<14-2,MARCUS DONOVAN>我不是来跟你争论的  维多利亚
<14-2,MARCUS DONOVAN>This isn't a debate, Victoria.

338
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,810
<14-2,MARCUS DONOVAN>我们有交情所以我才来给你提个醒
<14-2,MARCUS DONOVAN>I'm just giving you a heads-up 'cause we have history.

339
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:31,950
<14-2,MARCUS DONOVAN>告诉我她在哪
<14-2,MARCUS DONOVAN>Now, where is she?

340
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:38,460
<14-2,MARCUS DONOVAN>看好其它的门
<14-2,MARCUS DONOVAN>Cover the other doors.

341
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:39,730
<15-1,DONOVAN>你这是在犯错  马库斯
<15-1,DONOVAN>You're making a mistake, Marcus.

342
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,780
<15-2,GATES>这里另有蹊跷
<15-2,GATES>Something else is going on here.

343
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,700
<15-3,DONOVAN>无所谓  我有命在身
<15-3,DONOVAN>Doesn't matter. I have my orders.

344
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:49,450
<15-4,DONOVAN>贝克特探长在哪
<15-4,DONOVAN>Where's Detective Beckett?

345
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,560
<15-5,CASTLE>我不知道
<15-5,CASTLE>I have no idea.

346
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,230
<15-6,DONOVAN>封锁分局
<15-6,DONOVAN>Lock down the precinct.

347
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:58,110
<15-6,DONOVAN>一定不能让她离开这栋楼
<15-6,DONOVAN>Make sure she does not leave this building.

348
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:07,040
<16-1,CASTLE>我跟你说了  我不知道她去哪了
<16-1,CASTLE>I'm telling you, I don't know where she went.

349
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,710
<16-2,DONOVAN>你刚才还跟贝克特探长在休息室里
<16-2,DONOVAN>You were just in the break room with Detective Beckett.

350
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:12,220
<16-2,DONOVAN>她逃走前跟你说什么了
<16-2,DONOVAN>What did she say to you before she fled?

351
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,210
<16-3,CASTLE>她没有杀瓦肯·西蒙斯
<16-3,CASTLE>That she didn't kill Vulcan Simmons.

352
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:17,490
<16-4,DONOVAN>你知道这个女人现在是通缉犯吗
<16-4,DONOVAN>Do you understand this woman is now the target of a manhunt,

353
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,880
<16-4,DONOVAN>还很可能是个杀人犯
<16-4,DONOVAN>that she's most likely a murderer?

354
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:21,360
<16-5,CASTLE>我帮不了你
<16-5,CASTLE>I can't help you.

355
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,340
<16-6,DONOVAN>让他走
<16-6,DONOVAN>I want him gone.

356
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:30,130
<16-6,DONOVAN>他不该待在这个分局
<16-6,DONOVAN>He has no business in this precinct --

357
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:31,870
<16-6,DONOVAN>至少在我们调查此案期间
<16-6,DONOVAN>not while we're conducting this investigation.

358
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,630
<16-7,GATES>我想他说得对  卡塞尔先生
<16-7,GATES>I'm afraid he's right, Mr. Castle.

359
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:34,870
<16-7,GATES>你得离开了
<16-7,GATES>You're gonna have to leave.

360
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:36,300
<16-8,CASTLE>很乐意
<16-8,CASTLE>Gladly.

361
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:38,730
<16-8,CASTLE>副队
<16-8,CASTLE>L.T.

362
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:40,290
<17-1,ESPOSITO>跟我们走一会
<17-1,ESPOSITO>Follow us a minute.

363
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:41,470
<17-2,LT>快点
<17-2,LT>Make it fast.

364
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:42,950
<17-3,RYAN>这是怎么回事  卡塞尔
<17-3,RYAN>What's this all about, Castle?

365
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:44,450
<17-4,CASTLE>伙计们  她不愿把你们牵扯进来
<17-4,CASTLE>Guys, she wouldn't want you involved.

366
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:46,690
<17-5,ESPOSITO>我们已经牵扯进来了  我们是一家人  兄弟
<17-5,ESPOSITO>We're already involved. We're family, bro.

367
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,460
<17-6,RYAN>我们知道这不仅仅是瓦肯·西蒙斯的事
<17-6,RYAN>We know this is bigger than Vulcan Simmons.

368
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:49,380
<17-7,CASTLE>为什么
<17-7,CASTLE>How?

369
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:51,900
<17-8,RYAN>我们在杰森·马科斯所住酒店的周围排查过
<17-8,RYAN>We canvassed around the hotel where Jason Marks was staying.

370
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,420
<17-8,RYAN>领班说他跟这个人见过面
<17-8,RYAN>The bell captain there said he had a meeting with this man.

371
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,350
<17-8,RYAN>眼熟吗
<17-8,RYAN>Look familiar?

372
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:58,580
<17-9,CASTLE>是的  是史密斯
<17-9,CASTLE>Yeah. That's Smith.

373
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,880
<17-10,ESPOSITO>蒙哥马利警监的朋友  对吧
<17-10,ESPOSITO>Captain Montgomery's friend, right?

374
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:01,120
<17-10,ESPOSITO>就是他掌握着布莱肯的资料
<17-10,ESPOSITO>The one who kept Beckett safe

375
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,510
<17-10,ESPOSITO>从而确保了贝克特的安全
<17-10,ESPOSITO>by holding those files on Bracken.

376
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:03,830
<17-11,RYAN>后来被人炸没了
<17-11,RYAN>Until they got blown to high heaven.

377
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:06,830
<17-12,CASTLE>是的  但是史密斯已经死了  死在医院了
<17-12,CASTLE>Yeah, but Smith is dead. He died in the hospital.

378
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:08,600
<17-13,ESPOSITO>可能他是想让别人这么以为
<17-13,ESPOSITO>Maybe that's just how he wanted it to look.

379
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:13,690
<17-14,CASTLE>史密斯的确有能力伪造死亡
<17-14,CASTLE>Smith did have the resources to fake his own death.

380
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:17,270
<17-14,CASTLE>而且这是唯一能让布莱肯不再追杀他的办法
<17-14,CASTLE>And that is the only way Bracken would stop hunting him.

381
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,010
<17-14,CASTLE>布莱肯
<17-14,CASTLE>Bracken?

382
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,100
<17-15,RYAN>这事都是因为他吗
<17-15,RYAN>Is that what this is all about?

383
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:27,030
<17-16,CASTLE>我们认为瓦肯贩毒的钱资助了他的竞选活动
<17-16,CASTLE>We believe Vulcan's drug money was funding his campaign.

384
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,410
<17-16,CASTLE>我们想找到他们的联系
<17-16,CASTLE>We were trying to find a link,

385
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:30,130
<17-16,CASTLE>可能我们太接近真相了
<17-16,CASTLE>but maybe we got too close.

386
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,760
<17-17,ESPOSITO>史密斯扮演什么角色
<17-17,ESPOSITO>Well, how does Smith fit in?

387
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,530
<17-17,ESPOSITO>我不知道
<17-17,ESPOSITO>I don't know.

388
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:36,090
<17-18,CASTLE>但如果他冒险重新现身
<17-18,CASTLE>But if he took the risk of showing himself,

389
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:37,800
<17-18,CASTLE>那么一定出了很大的事
<17-18,CASTLE>something big must be going on.

390
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,620
<17-19,ESPOSITO>贝克特现在正被
<17-19,ESPOSITO>Between the cops and Bracken's guys,

391
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,370
<17-19,ESPOSITO>警察和布莱肯的人追捕
<17-19,ESPOSITO>Beckett's right in the cross hairs.

392
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:43,220
<17-20,RYAN>我们能做些什么
<17-20,RYAN>What can we do?

393
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:45,960
<17-21,LT>各位  我们得走了
<17-21,LT>Guys, we got to go.

394
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,750
<17-22,CASTLE>我再通知你们
<17-22,CASTLE>I'll let you know.

395
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:08,770
<18-1,CASTLE>-你还好吗  -是的
<18-1,CASTLE>- You okay? - Yeah.

396
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:10,660
<18-2,BECKETT>你被跟踪了吗
<18-2,BECKETT>Were you followed?

397
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:13,700
<18-3,CASTLE>没  没有  我特意换了三辆出租车
<18-3,CASTLE>No. No, no. I switched cabs three times just to be sure.

398
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,610
<18-3,CASTLE>多诺万调了半个城市的警察找你
<18-3,CASTLE>Donovan's got half the force looking for you.

399
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,420
<18-3,CASTLE>我们两人的东西
<18-3,CASTLE>For the couple who has everything --

400
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,850
<18-3,CASTLE>两部已连接的一次性手机
<18-3,CASTLE>two matching burner phones.

401
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:21,590
<18-3,CASTLE>当然卫星定位已经关了
<18-3,CASTLE>GPS turned off, of course.

402
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:26,040
<18-4,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我不能再让你继续陪着我了
<18-4,BECKETT>Listen, Castle, I can't ask you to stick around anymore.

403
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:27,780
<18-5,CASTLE>你不需要  我是自愿的
<18-5,CASTLE>You don't have to ask. I'm volunteering.

404
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,330
<18-6,BECKETT>不  这太危险了
<18-6,BECKETT>No. It's too dangerous.

405
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,300
<18-6,BECKETT>布莱肯现在知道了我是在唬他
<18-6,BECKETT>Bracken knows that I was bluffing now --

406
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:34,250
<18-6,BECKETT>他知道我没有那一堆对他不利的证据
<18-6,BECKETT>that I don't have this huge file of evidence against him.

407
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,500
<18-6,BECKETT>否则我就不需要为了扳倒他而去找瓦肯的麻烦
<18-6,BECKETT>Cause if I did, I wouldn't have to go after Vulcan to bring him down.

408
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,810
<18-6,BECKETT>我玩过火了
<18-6,BECKETT>I've overplayed my hand.

409
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:42,120
<18-6,BECKETT>现在已经没有什么能阻止他杀我了
<18-6,BECKETT>There's nothing to stop him from killing me anymore,

410
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,260
<18-6,BECKETT>他已经开始行动了
<18-6,BECKETT>So he's making his move.

411
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,030
<18-6,BECKETT>我也得做出回应
<18-6,BECKETT>And I have to make mine.

412
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,730
<18-6,BECKETT>我给他在华盛顿特区的办公室打了电话
<18-6,BECKETT>I called his office in D.C.

413
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:51,790
<18-6,BECKETT>布莱肯现在在纽约
<18-6,BECKETT>Bracken's in New York.

414
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:54,060
<18-7,CASTLE>那你的计划是什么
<18-7,CASTLE>So, what's your plan?

415
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:56,000
<18-7,CASTLE>你什么都没有就打算去找他吗
<18-7,CASTLE>You're gonna take a run at him with nothing?

416
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,330
<18-8,BECKETT>我还有什么选择
<18-8,BECKETT>What's my other option --

417
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:59,290
<18-8,BECKETT>躲起来等他们来逮捕我吗
<18-8,BECKETT>hide in the shadows and wait for them to arrest me?

418
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:01,600
<18-8,BECKETT>不出两天我就会被吊死在牢房里
<18-8,BECKETT>Two days later, I'll end up hanging in my jail cell.

419
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,160
<18-8,BECKETT>"前探长畏罪自杀"
<18-8,BECKETT>"Rogue cop commits suicide."

420
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:06,050
<18-9,CASTLE>也许还有别的办法
<18-9,CASTLE>Maybe there's another way.

421
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,940
<19-1,ESPOSITO>我从圣西蒙医院
<19-1,ESPOSITO>I pulled the death certificate for Michael Smith

422
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,430
<19-1,ESPOSITO>调出了迈克尔·史密斯的死亡证明
<19-1,ESPOSITO>from St. Simon's Hospital.

423
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:17,560
<19-1,ESPOSITO>是由奥利弗·普莱辛医生签署的
<19-1,ESPOSITO>It was signed by a Dr. Oliver Pressing.

424
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,110
<19-1,ESPOSITO>他是个合法医生  无不良记录
<19-1,ESPOSITO>He's a legit doctor in good standing.

425
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,730
<19-2,CASTLE>真是完美的人选
<19-2,CASTLE>Someone above reproach --

426
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:24,100
<19-2,CASTLE>假造死亡的绝佳人选
<19-2,CASTLE>An excellent candidate to help you fake your death.

427
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,850
<19-2,CASTLE>普莱辛医生和史密斯之间
<19-2,CASTLE>Did you find any other connections

428
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:27,570
<19-2,CASTLE>有什么联系吗
<19-2,CASTLE>between Dr. Pressing and Smith?

429
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:28,430
<19-3,ESPOSITO>事
<19-3,ESPOSITO>As --

430
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,370
<19-3,ESPOSITO>事实上  大有关系
<19-3,ESPOSITO>As a matter of fact, I did.

431
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,310
<19-3,ESPOSITO>普莱辛医生
<19-3,ESPOSITO>Dr. Pressing?

432
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,430
<20-1,BECKETT>纽约警局  我们有几个问题要问你
<20-1,BECKETT>NYPD. We need to ask you a few questions.

433
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,920
<20-2,OLIVER PRESSING>我时间不多  我正要开始巡病
<20-2,OLIVER PRESSING>I don't have much time. I'm about to start my rounds.

434
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:55,570
<20-2,OLIVER PRESSING>我们了解到你是麦哲伦游艇俱乐部的一员
<20-2,OLIVER PRESSING>We understand you belong to the Magellan Yacht Club.

435
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:57,650
<20-3,CASTLE>事实上  你是董事会成员之一
<20-3,CASTLE>As a matter of fact, you are a member of the board.

436
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:59,640
<20-4,PRESSING>俱乐部那边有什么问题吗
<20-4,PRESSING>Well, is there a problem at the club?

437
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:01,220
<20-5,BECKETT>你认识迈克尔·史密斯吗
<20-5,BECKETT>Do you know Michael Smith?

438
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:03,300
<20-6,CASTLE>你应该会认识他
<20-6,CASTLE>It seems that you would,

439
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,980
<20-6,CASTLE>因为他也是董事会成员
<20-6,CASTLE>since he was also a board member.

440
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:08,750
<20-7,PRESSING>我和史密斯先生是老相识  直到他去世
<20-7,PRESSING>Well, I was acquainted with Mr. Smith, until he passed away.

441
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:09,700
<20-7,PRESSING>抱歉  我有点糊涂了
<20-7,PRESSING>Excuse me -- I'm a little confused.

442
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,330
<20-7,PRESSING>你们问询的目的到底是什么
<20-7,PRESSING>What's the nature of your inquiry?

443
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:12,420
<20-8,BECKETT>我们正在找他
<20-8,BECKETT>We're looking for him.

444
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,390
<20-9,PRESSING>正如我说的  他已经不在了
<20-9,PRESSING>Well, like I told you, he's deceased.

445
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:17,590
<20-10,BECKETT>医生  是你帮他消失的
<20-10,BECKETT>Doctor, you helped him disappear.

446
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,210
<20-11,PRESSING>太荒谬了
<20-11,PRESSING>That's absurd.

447
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:22,620
<20-11,PRESSING>他死了我才签署了他的死亡证明
<20-11,PRESSING>I signed his death certificate because he was dead.

449
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:34,140
<20-12,BECKETT>求你了  我们只想联系上他
<20-12,BECKETT>Please -- we just need to reach him.

450
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,270
<20-12,BECKETT>我们知道他就在城里
<20-12,BECKETT>We know that he's in town.

451
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,830
<20-12,BECKETT>你帮他是因为你知道他处境危险
<20-12,BECKETT>You helped him because you knew that he was in danger,

452
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,220
<20-12,BECKETT>我们现在也四面楚歌
<20-12,BECKETT>and we're in the same danger now.

453
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:40,950
<20-12,BECKETT>非常抱歉
<20-12,BECKETT>I'm sorry.

454
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,310
<20-13,PRESSING>你在浪费你我的时间
<20-13,PRESSING>You're wasting your time and mine.

455
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:45,750
<20-14,CASTLE>医生  我们很会制造麻烦的
<20-14,CASTLE>Doctor, we can make a lot more noise.

456
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:48,130
<20-14,CASTLE>这是你想要的吗  这是他想要的
<20-14,CASTLE>Is that what you want? Is that what he wants?

457
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:49,130
<20-14,CASTLE>卡塞尔  我们得走了
<20-14,CASTLE>Castle, we got to go.

458
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,400
<21-1,BECKETT>我的照片不应该出现在新闻上
<21-1,BECKETT>My picture shouldn't be on the news --

459
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,880
<21-1,BECKETT>不会因为这个  也不会这么快的
<21-1,BECKETT>Not for this, not this fast.

460
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,350
<21-2,CASTLE>-布莱肯  -是的
<21-2,CASTLE>- Bracken? - Yeah.

461
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,240
<21-3,BECKETT>我们得快点出去
<21-3,BECKETT>We got to get the hell out of here.

462
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:02,080
<21-3,BECKETT>卡塞尔  走楼梯
<21-3,BECKETT>Castle, stairwell.

463
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,440
<21-3,BECKETT>等等
<21-3,BECKETT>Wait.

464
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:11,220
<21-4,CASTLE>是我的手机  那个一次性手机
<21-4,CASTLE>It's my phone -- my burner phone.

465
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:12,760
<21-5,BECKETT>怎么会有人
<21-5,BECKETT>How did someone --

466
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,150
<21-6,CASTLE>我不知道
<21-6,CASTLE>I have no idea.

467
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:17,240
<21-6,CASTLE>你好
<21-6,CASTLE>Hello?

468
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:20,540
<21-7,SMITH>我知道你在找我  卡塞尔先生
<21-7,SMITH>I understand you're looking for me, Mr. Castle.

469
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:24,860
<21-7,SMITH>20分钟后老地方见
<21-7,SMITH>Meet me in the usual place -- 20 minutes.

470
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:29,290
<21-7,SMITH>是史密斯
<21-7,SMITH>That's Smith.

471
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,100
<21-7,SMITH>我们走
<21-7,SMITH>Let's go.

472
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,780
<22-1,CASTLE>他迟到了
<22-1,CASTLE>He's late.

473
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:42,190
<22-2,BECKETT>也许他改变主意了或者害怕了
<22-2,BECKETT>Maybe he changed his mind or got spooked.

474
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:43,620
<22-3,CASTLE>这家伙从来不会怕
<22-3,CASTLE>This guy doesn't spook.

475
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,290
<22-4,BECKETT>你真的觉得他能帮我们
<22-4,BECKETT>Do you really think he can help us?

476
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,360
<22-5,CASTLE>他曾经帮过
<22-5,CASTLE>He has before.

477
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,270
<22-6,SMITH>这个距离就够了
<22-6,SMITH>That's close enough.

478
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:04,640
<22-6,SMITH>我费尽心机才让自己活下来
<22-6,SMITH>I've gone to great lengths to keep alive.

479
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,080
<22-6,SMITH>现在我也得处处小心
<22-6,SMITH>I'd like to stay that way.

480
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:07,440
<22-7,BECKETT>但你还是回来了
<22-7,BECKETT>And yet, you came back.

481
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:09,150
<22-8,SMITH>我可以生活在阴影中
<22-8,SMITH>Well, I can survive in the shadows.

482
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:11,080
<22-8,SMITH>可我无法忍受终日不见阳光
<22-8,SMITH>I just don't want to live there forever.

483
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:14,550
<22-9,CASTLE>你想扳倒布莱肯  我们也是
<22-9,CASTLE>You need to take Bracken down -- same as we do.

484
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:16,600
<22-10,BECKETT>总有办法的
<22-10,BECKETT>There has to be a way.

485
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:18,370
<22-11,SMITH>是的  我以为我找到了
<22-11,SMITH>Yes, and I thought I'd found it.

486
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:21,470
<22-11,SMITH>我曾找到布莱肯的手下
<22-11,SMITH>I got to one of Bracken's men.

487
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,520
<22-11,SMITH>他告诉我还有一件让参议员
<22-11,SMITH>He told me there was something

488
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,300
<22-11,SMITH>非常害怕的证据
<22-11,SMITH>that the senator was afraid of --

489
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,960
<22-11,SMITH>是他以前的同伙为了自保录下来的
<22-11,SMITH>A recording made by a former associate to protect himself.

490
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:32,740
<22-11,SMITH>录音里布莱肯承认他曾谋杀
<22-11,SMITH>A recording in which Bracken admits to murder.

491
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,400
<22-12,BECKETT>你知道录音在哪里吗
<22-12,BECKETT>Do you know where it is?

492
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:38,420
<22-13,SMITH>不  布莱肯也不知道
<22-13,SMITH>No, and neither does Bracken.

493
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,720
<22-13,SMITH>尽管我和他一样花费了大量精力
<22-13,SMITH>Though he spent considerable resources

494
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,490
<22-13,SMITH>试图找到录音
<22-13,SMITH>trying to recover it -- as did I --

495
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:44,650
<22-13,SMITH>一年多了  都没有结果
<22-13,SMITH>for over a year, with no luck.

496
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:46,830
<22-13,SMITH>天呐  也许根本就不存在吧
<22-13,SMITH>Hell, it may not even exist.

497
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:49,830
<22-13,SMITH>但在我的搜寻过程中  我联系上了
<22-13,SMITH>But in my search, I did make a contact --

498
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,710
<22-13,SMITH>一个布莱肯组织里的顾问
<22-13,SMITH>A consultant in Bracken's organization --

499
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,800
<22-13,SMITH>他承诺他会曝光
<22-13,SMITH>And he promised that he could expose

500
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:59,030
<22-13,SMITH>布莱肯竞选融资涉及腐败
<22-13,SMITH>Bracken's campaign finances as corrupt.

501
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,770
<22-13,SMITH>可他也因此被杀了
<22-13,SMITH>But it got him killed.

502
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:02,430
<22-14,CASTLE>杰森·马科斯
<22-14,CASTLE>Jason Marks.

503
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,300
<22-14,CASTLE>是的
<22-14,CASTLE>Yes.

504
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,570
<22-15,SMITH>我很快就要说服他加入我们了
<22-15,SMITH>I was close to bringing him into the fold,

505
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:07,180
<22-15,SMITH>一定是被他们发现了
<22-15,SMITH>but they must have found out,

506
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,160
<22-15,SMITH>他也成了他们的累赘
<22-15,SMITH>which made him a liability.

507
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,540
<22-16,BECKETT>一定还有其他办法扳倒布莱肯
<22-16,BECKETT>There's got to be another way to get to Bracken.

508
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:12,300
<22-16,BECKETT>没有了
<22-16,BECKETT>There isn't.

509
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,790
<22-17,SMITH>我得从头再来
<22-17,SMITH>I just have to start again.

510
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,110
<22-18,BECKETT>我们一直在调查瓦肯的犯罪网
<22-18,BECKETT>We've been tracking Vulcan's network.

511
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:18,230
<22-18,BECKETT>也许我们能帮上忙
<22-18,BECKETT>Maybe we can help.

512
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,950
<22-19,SMITH>警探  你现在是泥菩萨过河
<22-19,SMITH>Detective, you are radioactive.

513
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,810
<22-19,SMITH>自身难保
<22-19,SMITH>You can't even help yourself.

514
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,200
<22-20,SMITH>不要再试图联系我了
<22-20,SMITH>Don't try to contact me again.

515
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:30,250
<22-20,SMITH>史密斯
<22-20,SMITH>Smith.

516
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,370
<22-21,CASTLE>一定还有什么我们可以做的
<22-21,CASTLE>There must be something we can do.

517
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:35,450
<22-21,CASTLE>逃跑
<22-21,CASTLE>Run.

518
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,330
<22-22,SMITH>消失
<22-22,SMITH>Disappear.

519
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,400
<22-22,SMITH>因为假如你们不走
<22-22,SMITH>Because if you don't...

520
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:42,040
<22-22,SMITH>他就会杀了你们
<22-22,SMITH>He will kill you.

521
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:02,460
<23-1,RYAN>新闻上都在说她
<23-1,RYAN>She's all over the news.

522
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,590
<23-1,RYAN>你有她的消息吗  电话  短信
<23-1,RYAN>You heard anything from them -- calls, texts?

523
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:06,930
<23-2,ESPOSITO>从今天下午之后就没消息了
<23-2,ESPOSITO>Not since this afternoon.

524
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:09,220
<23-2,ESPOSITO>不知道他们的行踪  我们也不能妄动
<23-2,ESPOSITO>And we can't make a move till we know where they are.

525
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:10,470
<23-3,GATES>两位
<23-3,GATES>Gentlemen?

526
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:14,790
<23-4,GATES>是不是还有我不知道的内情
<23-4,GATES>Is there something going on here that I should know about?

527
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,150
<23-5,ESPOSITO>你是指什么
<23-5,ESPOSITO>What do you mean?

528
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:19,860
<23-6,GATES>贝克特不是杀人犯  这我知道
<23-6,GATES>Beckett's not a killer. I know that.

529
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:21,510
<23-6,GATES>但这个案子会毁了她
<23-6,GATES>But she's gonna go down for this.

530
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:24,050
<23-6,GATES>板上钉钉的事了  除非我能施以援手
<23-6,GATES>It's open and shut, unless I can protect her.

531
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:26,960
<23-6,GATES>但如果我蒙在鼓里  我没法保护她
<23-6,GATES>And I can't do that if I'm left in the dark.

532
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:30,740
<23-6,GATES>所以如果有人陷害她  我得知道原因
<23-6,GATES>So if she's being set up, I need to know why.

533
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:38,020
<23-7,RYAN>长官  贝克特母亲被杀的案子你知道多少
<23-7,RYAN>Sir, how much do you know about Beckett's mother's murder?

534
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:40,790
<23-8,GATES>就是普通的街头劫杀  是个悬案
<23-8,GATES>It's a random stabbing -- never solved.

535
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,380
<23-9,ESPOSITO>背后其实大有内情
<23-9,ESPOSITO>There's a lot more to it than that.

536
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,200
<23-10,GATES>跟我仔细说说
<23-10,GATES>Tell me everything.

537
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,330
<24-1,CASTLE>"逃犯"套房
<24-1,CASTLE>The "fugitive" suite --

538
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:55,990
<24-1,CASTLE>现金免登记能要到的最好房间了
<24-1,CASTLE>best room that cash and no I.D. can buy.

539
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,410
<24-2,BECKETT>我们必须反击布莱肯
<24-2,BECKETT>We got to take the fight to Bracken.

540
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,630
<24-3,CASTLE>找那盘没人找得到的神秘磁带吗
<24-3,CASTLE>By looking for a mythical tape that no one can find?

541
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:02,910
<24-3,CASTLE>史密斯说得对
<24-3,CASTLE>No, Smith was right.

542
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:04,840
<24-3,CASTLE>乔装之后  我们得赶紧逃走
<24-3,CASTLE>Once we change your look, we get out of town.

543
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:07,290
<24-4,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我妈妈常说
<24-4,BECKETT>You know, Castle, my mom had a saying,

544
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,220
<24-4,BECKETT>"唯真必胜"
<24-4,BECKETT>"Vincit omnia veritas."

545
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,620
<24-5,CASTLE>"真理战胜一切"
<24-5,CASTLE>"Truth conquers all."

546
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:13,850
<24-6,BECKETT>逃走的话我们就不能找到真相了
<24-6,BECKETT>We'll never find the truth if we run away.

547
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:17,080
<24-6,BECKETT>凯特  如果丢了性命  也找不到真相
<24-6,BECKETT>Kate, we're never gonna find the truth if we're dead.

548
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:21,010
<24-7,CASTLE>我们这不是逃避  而是保存实力  明白吗
<24-7,CASTLE>We're not running away. We are surviving, okay?

549
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:22,620
<24-7,CASTLE>为了能战斗到明天
<24-7,CASTLE>We're living to fight another day.

550
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:24,230
<24-7,CASTLE>我们一定会扳倒布莱肯
<24-7,CASTLE>We will take down Bracken.

551
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:26,420
<24-7,CASTLE>但首先我们得找到藏身之所
<24-7,CASTLE>First, we're gonna find a safe place

552
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:27,590
<24-7,CASTLE>然后想办法反击
<24-7,CASTLE>and come up with a plan.

553
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:29,270
<24-7,CASTLE>我认识一个人
<24-7,CASTLE>I got a friend.

554
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:31,630
<24-7,CASTLE>能不说二话就给我们搞到一辆车
<24-7,CASTLE>He will give us a car, no questions asked.

555
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,960
<24-8,BECKETT>那好  去吧
<24-8,BECKETT>Okay. Go.

556
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:36,140
<24-9,CASTLE>我会回来的
<24-9,CASTLE>I'll be back.

557
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,810
<24-9,CASTLE>我们会杀回来的
<24-9,CASTLE>We'll be back.

558
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:04,310
<25-1,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<25-1,BECKETT>Castle?

559
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:16,940
<25-2,SENATOR WILLIAM BRACKEN>你好啊  探长
<25-2,SENATOR WILLIAM BRACKEN>Hello, Detective.

560
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:20,810
<25-3,THOMAS>想都别想
<25-3,THOMAS>Don't even think about it.

561
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:21,960
<25-4,SERGIO>把剪子扔了
<25-4,SERGIO>Drop the scissors.

562
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:30,840
<25-5,BRACKEN>我们本来说好了的  停火休战
<25-5,BRACKEN>We had an agreement -- a truce.

563
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,340
<25-5,BRACKEN>相安无事
<25-5,BRACKEN>"Live and let live."

564
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:35,290
<25-5,BRACKEN>我遵守了我的承诺  我甚至救了你一命
<25-5,BRACKEN>I held up my end of the bargain. I even saved your life.

565
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:38,490
<25-6,BECKETT>这就能弥补你从我这夺走的东西了吗
<25-6,BECKETT>And that makes up for what you took from me?

566
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:40,370
<25-7,BRACKEN>你怎么不想想我给了你的
<25-7,BRACKEN>What about what I gave to you?

567
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:43,630
<25-7,BRACKEN>你如今的地位  你如今的成就
<25-7,BRACKEN>Everything you are, everything you've accomplished

568
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,730
<25-7,BRACKEN>都是拜我所赐
<25-7,BRACKEN>is because of me.

569
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:46,910
<25-8,BECKETT>这样你杀了人就能心安理得了吗
<25-8,BECKETT>Is that how you justify murder?

570
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,790
<25-8,BECKETT>还说什么"这使你成了更好的人"
<25-8,BECKETT>"It builds character?"

571
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:53,730
<25-8,BECKETT>为什么不给我个机会让你变得更好些
<25-8,BECKETT>Then why don't you give me a chance to build yours?

572
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:54,810
<25-9,BRACKEN>你本来前景无限
<25-9,BRACKEN>You had a future.

573
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,880
<25-9,BRACKEN>你为什么就不能放下这些宿怨
<25-9,BRACKEN>Why couldn't you just let this go

574
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,220
<25-9,BRACKEN>好好过你的日子  让我也能向前看
<25-9,BRACKEN>and move on so I could do the same?

575
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,000
<25-10,BRACKEN>看来我今天说不动你
<25-10,BRACKEN>So, I guess there's no point

576
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,310
<25-10,BRACKEN>投我一票了  是不是
<25-10,BRACKEN>in asking for your vote, is there?

577
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:09,900
<25-10,BRACKEN>你参选不了
<25-10,BRACKEN>You're not gonna be on the ballot.

578
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:13,810
<25-11,BECKETT>你的竞选资金来自贩毒
<25-11,BECKETT>A presidential campaign financed by drug money

579
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:14,990
<25-11,BECKETT>为了遮掩事实还连杀数人
<25-11,BECKETT>with a trail of dead bodies?

580
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:16,970
<25-11,BECKETT>这么猛的料你是埋不了的
<25-11,BECKETT>There's no hole big enough to bury all of that.

581
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,340
<25-11,BECKETT>实话跟你说
<25-11,BECKETT>I got to tell you...

582
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,970
<25-12,BRACKEN>我真是有点钦佩你  你坚定不移的道德观
<25-12,BRACKEN>part of me really admires you -- your moral certitude,

583
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:26,760
<25-12,BRACKEN>为了信仰而战的劲头和手段
<25-12,BRACKEN>the way you fight for what you believe in,

584
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,490
<25-12,BRACKEN>即便明知会自毁前程也在所不惜
<25-12,BRACKEN>even knowing it's gonna destroy you.

585
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:32,400
<25-12,BRACKEN>但我的这点钦佩之心
<25-12,BRACKEN>But the part of me that admires you

586
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:35,870
<25-12,BRACKEN>可没法帮我作艰难的决定
<25-12,BRACKEN>is not the part that makes tough decisions.

587
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:38,390
<25-13,BECKETT>那好
<25-13,BECKETT>Fine.

588
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,250
<25-13,BECKETT>杀了我
<25-13,BECKETT>Then kill me.

589
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:43,480
<25-13,BECKETT>动手吧
<25-13,BECKETT>Do it.

590
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:44,860
<25-13,BECKETT>朝我开枪吧
<25-13,BECKETT>Pull the trigger.

591
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,190
<25-14,BRACKEN>我有专人代劳
<25-14,BRACKEN>I have people for that.

592
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:48,410
<25-15,BECKETT>我不想让他们下手
<25-15,BECKETT>I don't want them.

593
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:51,860
<25-15,BECKETT>我想让你动手
<25-15,BECKETT>I want you.

594
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:54,950
<25-15,BECKETT>快动手吧
<25-15,BECKETT>Do it -- now.

595
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:58,320
<25-15,BECKETT>难道你没种亲自动手
<25-15,BECKETT>Or don't you have the balls?

596
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:02,000
<25-16,BRACKEN>这样就会有证据把我和凶案现场联系起来
<25-16,BRACKEN>And create physical evidence linking me to the crime scene?

597
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,050
<25-16,BRACKEN>你明知道我没这么傻
<25-16,BRACKEN>We both know I'm smarter than that.

598
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:11,730
<25-16,BRACKEN>再见了  凯特
<25-16,BRACKEN>Goodbye, Kate.

599
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:16,910
<25-17,BECKETT>真相一定会大白于天下的
<25-17,BECKETT>The truth is gonna come out!

600
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:18,470
<25-18,BRACKEN>没有真相了
<25-18,BRACKEN>There is no truth.

601
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:21,780
<25-18,BRACKEN>不再有了
<25-18,BRACKEN>Not anymore.

602
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:38,300
<25-19,BECKETT>不
<25-19,BECKETT>No!

603
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:45,840
<25-20,THOMAS>把她嘴撬开
<25-20,THOMAS>Open her mouth.

604
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:54,550
<26-1,BECKETT>那个胶囊是做什么用的
<26-1,BECKETT>What was in that pill?

605
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:58,680
<26-2,THOMAS>让你消停一会儿
<26-2,THOMAS>Something to relax you.

606
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:02,160
<26-2,THOMAS>现在我们得灌醉你
<26-2,THOMAS>Now we're gonna take a little drink.

607
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:09,620
<26-2,THOMAS>有证据能证明布莱肯犯下这些案子吗
<26-2,THOMAS>Is there any proof that Bracken did these things?

608
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:11,870
<27-1,GATES>现在没了
<27-1,GATES>Not anymore.

609
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:14,540
<27-2,ESPOSITO>蒙哥马利保存了一些文件  但现在也没有了
<27-2,ESPOSITO>Montgomery had a file, but it's gone now.

610
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:17,060
<27-3,RYAN>长官  我们得帮她
<27-3,RYAN>Sir, we need to help her.

611
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:20,570
<27-4,GATES>没有证据
<27-4,GATES>No evidence...

612
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,850
<27-4,GATES>对方又是权势熏天的政界大佬
<27-4,GATES>Against one of the most powerful men in the country?

613
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,350
<27-4,GATES>我们无能为力了
<27-4,GATES>I don't think we can.

614
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,850
<27-4,GATES>把枪拿来  她醉了
<27-4,GATES>Get the gun. She's wasted.

615
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,060
<28-1,THOMAS>别紧张
<28-1,THOMAS>Relax.

616
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:54,160
<28-2,THOMAS>就快完了
<28-2,THOMAS>It's almost over.

617
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:06,360
<28-2,THOMAS>把你的手指放进来
<28-2,THOMAS>Let's get your finger in there.

618
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:16,660
<28-2,THOMAS>很好
<28-2,THOMAS>Good.

619
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:21,080
<28-2,THOMAS>凯特
<28-2,THOMAS>Kate?

620
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:36,240
<28-2,THOMAS>他告诉我还有一件让参议员
<28-2,THOMAS>He told me there was something out there

621
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:37,660
<28-2,THOMAS>非常害怕的证据
<28-2,THOMAS>the Senator was afraid of --

622
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:40,140
<30-1,SMITH>是他以前的同伙为了自保录下来的
<30-1,SMITH>A recording made by a former associate to protect...

623
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:43,370
<30-1,SMITH>录音里布莱肯承认他曾谋杀
<30-1,SMITH>...A recording in which bracken admits to murder.

624
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,140
<30-2,MONTGOMERY>当你走进第12分局时
<30-2,MONTGOMERY>When you walked into the 12th,

625
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:47,660
<30-2,MONTGOMERY>我感觉到了上帝之手
<30-2,MONTGOMERY>I felt the hand of god.

626
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:50,530
<30-2,MONTGOMERY>我知道他在给我另一个机会  然后我想
<30-2,MONTGOMERY>I knew he was giving me another chance, and I thought,

627
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:53,210
<30-2,MONTGOMERY>"如果我能像保护她那样的保护你"
<30-2,MONTGOMERY>"If I could protect you the way I should have protected her"...

628
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,920
<30-2,MONTGOMERY>你是蒙哥马利  蒙哥马利警监
<30-2,MONTGOMERY>You're Montgomery -- I mean, captain Montgomery.

629

<31-1,BECKETT>我认识你吗  警官
<31-1,BECKETT>Do I know you, officer...

630
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,430
<31-2,MONTGOMERY>贝克特
<31-2,MONTGOMERY>Beckett?

631
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:03,450
<31-3,BECKETT>不  长官  我只是...我希望与您共事
<31-3,BECKETT>No, sir. I just -- I've always wanted to do what you do.

632
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:05,400
<31-3,BECKETT>我很想加入凶杀组
<31-3,BECKETT>I wanted to be in homicide.

633
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,450
<31-4,MONTGOMERY>是吗  那你现在在哪个组
<31-4,MONTGOMERY>Is that right? What are you doing now?

634
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:09,080
<31-5,BECKETT>巡逻组
<31-5,BECKETT>Patrol.

635
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:11,170
<31-6,MONTGOMERY>这个我看出来了  我是问你在档案室里干什么
<31-6,MONTGOMERY>I see that. But what are you doing in the archives?

636
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:13,500
<31-7,BECKETT>对不起  长官  我不是故意闯进来的
<31-7,BECKETT>I'm sorry, sir. I didn't -- I didn't mean to be here.

637
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,780
<31-7,BECKETT>我知道我不该来  但我在调查一个案子
<31-7,BECKETT>I know I shouldn't be, but I was looking into a case --

638
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,190
<31-7,BECKETT>我妈妈的谋杀案
<31-7,BECKETT>My mom's homicide.

639
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:19,550
<31-8,MONTGOMERY>乔安娜·贝克特
<31-8,MONTGOMERY>Johanna Beckett.

640
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,090
<31-9,BECKETT>你认识她吗
<31-9,BECKETT>Did you know her?

641
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,560
<31-10,MONTGOMERY>我知道她的案子没破
<31-10,MONTGOMERY>I know her case is unsolved.

642
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:24,510
<31-10,MONTGOMERY>而你在查阅文件
<31-10,MONTGOMERY>And you're reviewing the files

643
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:28,910
<31-10,MONTGOMERY>看看他们是否漏掉了什么线索
<31-10,MONTGOMERY>to see if they might have... missed something.

644
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:29,860
<31-11,BECKETT>是的
<31-11,BECKETT>Yes, sir.

645
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,640
<31-12,MONTGOMERY>如果案子没破  很有可能
<31-12,MONTGOMERY>If the case is unsolved, chances are,

646
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:35,750
<31-12,MONTGOMERY>你要找的答案并不在这个文件里
<31-12,MONTGOMERY>the answers you're looking for probably aren't in that file.

647
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:39,730
<31-13,MONTGOMERY>你妈妈是做什么的  贝克特警官
<31-13,MONTGOMERY>What did your mother do, officer Beckett?

648
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:41,140
<31-14,BECKETT>她是一名律师
<31-14,BECKETT>She was a lawyer.

649
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:42,790
<31-15,MONTGOMERY>你觉得她的死或许和
<31-15,MONTGOMERY>You think her death might have had

650
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:44,750
<31-15,MONTGOMERY>她当时正在打的官司有关系吗
<31-15,MONTGOMERY>something to do with a case she was handling?

651
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:46,740
<31-16,BECKETT>调查她的案子的警官
<31-16,BECKETT>Well, the detective that was working her case --

652
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:49,560
<31-16,BECKETT>拉格兰说这只是随机杀人  但是...
<31-16,BECKETT>Raglan -- said that it was just random, but --

653
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:52,220
<31-17,MONTGOMERY>你有查阅她的私人用品吗
<31-17,MONTGOMERY>Well, did you look through her personal belongings --

654
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:56,540
<31-17,MONTGOMERY>旧的笔记本  账本  日记  磁带
<31-17,MONTGOMERY>Old notebooks, journals, diaries, cassette recordings --

655
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:58,240
<31-17,MONTGOMERY>之类的东西
<31-17,MONTGOMERY>stuff like that?

656
00:32:58,290 --> 00:32:59,610
<31-18,BECKETT>是的  看过很多遍了
<31-18,BECKETT>Yes, sir -- tons of times.

657
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:01,930
<31-18,BECKETT>但我还没找到任何与案件有关的东西
<31-18,BECKETT>But I haven't found anything that seems relevant.

658
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,310
<31-19,MONTGOMERY>继续找吧
<31-19,MONTGOMERY>Well, keep looking.

659
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:07,010
<31-19,MONTGOMERY>或许哪天你会发现线索
<31-19,MONTGOMERY>You never know where something might turn up.

660
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,580
<31-20,MONTGOMERY>很高兴认识你  贝克特警官
<31-20,MONTGOMERY>Nice meeting you,Officer Beckett.

661
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:16,350
<31-21,MONTGOMERY>对于你妈妈的事  我很遗憾
<31-21,MONTGOMERY>Sorry about your mom.

662
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,800
<31-22,BECKETT>谢谢  长官
<31-22,BECKETT>Thank you, sir.

663
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:33,960
<32-1,CASTLE>你感觉怎么样了
<32-1,CASTLE>How are you feeling?

664
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,460
<32-2,BECKETT>我们在哪儿
<32-2,BECKETT>Where are we?

665
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,900
<32-3,CASTLE>雷谱敦  佛蒙特州
<32-3,CASTLE>Ripton, Vermont -- population 588.

666
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:42,840
<32-3,CASTLE>过几个小时  我们就会到加拿大了
<32-3,CASTLE>In a couple of short hours, we will be crossing into Canada.

667
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:43,630
<32-3,CASTLE>调头
<32-3,CASTLE>Turn around.

668
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:45,820
<32-4,BECKETT>我们要回去
<32-4,BECKETT>We have to go back.

669
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:46,800
<32-5,CASTLE>什么
<32-5,CASTLE>What?

670
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,050
<32-6,BECKETT>是蒙哥马利
<32-6,BECKETT>It was Montgomery.

671
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:49,960
<32-6,BECKETT>是他把布莱肯那事录下来了
<32-6,BECKETT>He made that recording of Bracken --

672
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,850
<32-6,BECKETT>史密斯一直在找的那盘磁带是他录的
<32-6,BECKETT>the one that Smith has been looking for.

673
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:54,220
<32-7,CASTLE>蒙哥马利警监  你怎么知道的
<32-7,CASTLE>Captain Montgomery? How can you possibly know that?

674
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:55,250
<32-8,BECKETT>卡塞尔  当我第一次见到他的时候
<32-8,BECKETT>Castle, when I first met him,

675
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:56,740
<32-8,BECKETT>他说了些关于我妈妈谋杀案的事情
<32-8,BECKETT>he was saying things about my mother's murder,

676
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:59,560
<32-8,BECKETT>当时我没有明白过来
<32-8,BECKETT>things that I-I didn't understand at the time.

677
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:03,130
<32-8,BECKETT>但他特别提到了一盘磁带
<32-8,BECKETT>But he specifically mentioned a cassette recording.

678
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:06,540
<32-9,CASTLE>史密斯说过把那一切都录下来的人
<32-9,CASTLE>And Smith said that the person who made that recording

679
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,790
<32-9,CASTLE>是布莱肯的前同事
<32-9,CASTLE>was a former associate of Bracken's.

680
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:10,210
<32-10,BECKETT>没错  这下就都说得通了
<32-10,BECKETT>Yeah. It adds up.

681
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:14,890
<32-11,CASTLE>但如果蒙哥马利手里真的有那样的证据
<32-11,CASTLE>Okay, but if Montgomery did have that kind of evidence,

682
00:34:14,890 --> 00:34:16,680
<32-11,CASTLE>他为什么不直接给史密斯呢
<32-11,CASTLE>why wouldn't he have just given it to Smith?

683
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:18,840
<32-12,BECKETT>我觉得他给我妈妈了
<32-12,BECKETT>I think he gave it to my mom.

684
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:21,610
<32-12,BECKETT>他问当我查阅她的东西时
<32-12,BECKETT>He asked if I had been through her belongings,

685
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:23,420
<32-12,BECKETT>是否发现了一盘磁带
<32-12,BECKETT>if I came across a cassette.

686
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:27,620
<32-13,CASTLE>凯特  如果他把磁带给你妈妈了  你肯定会发现
<32-13,CASTLE>Kate, if he gave her the tape, you would've found it.

687
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:29,030
<32-13,CASTLE>你查阅她的东西能有上百万遍了
<32-13,CASTLE>You've been through her things a million times.

688
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,450
<32-14,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我当时不知道该找什么
<32-14,BECKETT>Castle, I didn't know what I was looking for.

689
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:34,780
<32-14,BECKETT>答案就在那里  我知道
<32-14,BECKETT>The answer is there. I know it.

690
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:36,530
<32-14,BECKETT>在我公寓里有一大箱我妈的东西
<32-14,BECKETT>I have a box of her things in my apartment.

691
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:37,590
<32-14,BECKETT>我们要回去
<32-14,BECKETT>We've got to go back.

692
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:39,640
<32-15,CASTLE>你疯了吗  他们正监视着你家
<32-15,CASTLE>That's crazy. They'll be staking out your place.

693
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,880
<32-16,BECKETT>布莱肯不会派人去的  至少不是现在
<32-16,BECKETT>Not Bracken's guys -- not now.

694
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,390
<32-17,CASTLE>那多诺万的手下呢  他会派警察去守着的
<32-17,CASTLE>And how about Donovan's guys? He'll have cops up there.

695
00:34:44,390 --> 00:34:46,250
<32-17,CASTLE>我们根本不可能靠近得了你家
<32-17,CASTLE>There's no way we're getting near that place.

696
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,040
<32-18,BECKETT>我们会进去的
<32-18,BECKETT>We will.

697
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,140
<32-18,BECKETT>我们只是需要一点帮助
<32-18,BECKETT>We just need a little help.

698
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:55,330
<33-1,RYAN>各位  今天你们走运了
<33-1,RYAN>Hey, guys. Yeah, it's your, uh, luck day.

699
00:34:55,330 --> 00:34:57,530
<33-1,RYAN>多诺万派我们来接班好让你们去吃点东西
<33-1,RYAN>Donovan sent us over so you can grab a bite to eat.

700
00:34:57,570 --> 00:34:59,420
<33-2,UNIFORM>还有一个小时才到我们的午餐时间
<33-2,UNIFORM>We're not supposed to take lunch for another hour.

701
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:01,480
<33-3,ESPOSITO>对不起  你现在不方便吗
<33-3,ESPOSITO>Oh. I'm sorry. Is this not a good time for you?

702
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:04,340
<33-3,ESPOSITO>要我们在这儿等着你们变饿吗
<33-3,ESPOSITO>So, what? We should just wait here until you guys get hungry?

703
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:07,070
<33-4,UNIFORM>好吧  我们去吃点东西  马上回来
<33-4,UNIFORM>All right. We'll grab a slice and be back in a few.

704
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:15,580
<33-5,BECKETT>谢了
<33-5,BECKETT>Thanks.

705
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:16,860
<33-6,RYAN>你们有两分钟
<33-6,RYAN>You've got about two minutes.

706
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:26,160
<33-7,BECKETT>如果蒙哥马利把磁带给她了
<33-7,BECKETT>Okay, if Montgomery gave her the tape,

707
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,110
<33-8,BECKETT>她肯定会对此做些笔记
<33-8,BECKETT>she would have written something down about it.

708
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:30,620
<33-8,BECKETT>我留了些她的笔记本放这箱子里了
<33-8,BECKETT>I kept some of her notebooks in here.

709
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:32,490
<33-9,BECKETT>该死
<33-9,BECKETT>Damn it.

710
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,380
<33-10,CASTLE>她的预约本
<33-10,CASTLE>Her appointment book.

711
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,100
<33-10,CASTLE>这是什么  某种速记吗
<33-10,CASTLE>What is this -- some kind of shorthand?

712
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,920
<33-11,BECKETT>是的  她在法学院时发明了一种代码
<33-11,BECKETT>Uh, yeah, she developed a code when she was in law school

713
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,190
<33-11,BECKETT>以防有人传唤她交出笔记
<33-11,BECKETT>in case anyone subpoenaed her notes.

714
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:47,550
<33-12,CASTLE>这方法太天才了
<33-12,CASTLE>That's ingenious.

715
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:50,090
<33-13,BECKETT>但弊端就是除了她没人知道那是什么意思
<33-13,BECKETT>Except she was the only one who knew what it meant.

716
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:50,950
<33-13,BECKETT>我把它交给我在国安局
<33-13,BECKETT>I gave it to contacts

717
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:53,570
<33-13,BECKETT>联调局和军情局的熟人
<33-13,BECKETT>in the NSA, the FBI, military intelligence.

718
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:55,350
<33-13,BECKETT>没有人破译出来了
<33-13,BECKETT>No one was able to decipher it.

719
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:58,040
<33-14,CASTLE>她就是在这天被杀了
<33-14,CASTLE>This is the day she died.

720
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,610
<33-14,CASTLE>这里面肯定写着些跟案子有关的事情
<33-14,CASTLE>There's got to be something in here about that case.

721
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:01,170
<33-15,BECKETT>我们可没时间查明了
<33-15,BECKETT>Yeah, well, we don't have time to figure it out.

722
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:02,130
<33-15,BECKETT>别看了  卡塞尔  我们要走了
<33-15,BECKETT>Come on, Castle. We got to go.

723
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:05,150
<33-16,CASTLE>看看这最后一条  "D.Me和家人"
<33-16,CASTLE>Hey, look at this last entry -- "D. Me w/ family"?

724
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,530
<33-17,BECKETT>"和家人吃晚餐"  她那天正是在
<33-17,BECKETT>"Dinner with family" -- she was on her way

725
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:09,180
<33-17,BECKETT>晚上去饭店找我们的路上被杀的
<33-17,BECKETT>to the restaurant to meet us the night that she was killed.

726
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:12,280
<33-18,CASTLE>看看"D"和"M"之间靠多近啊
<33-18,CASTLE>Look how close the "D" is to the "M."

727
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:15,130
<33-18,CASTLE>D.M.
<33-18,CASTLE>"D.M."

728
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:18,240
<33-19,BECKETT>蒙哥马利警监
<33-19,BECKETT>"Detective Montgomery."

729
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:20,090
<33-20,CASTLE>证据
<33-20,CASTLE>"E" -- "Evidence."

730
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:21,460
<33-20,CASTLE>蒙哥马利警监的物证
<33-20,CASTLE>"Detective Montgomery evidence."

731
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:22,710
<33-21,BECKETT>-难道你认为  -我是这样想的
<33-21,BECKETT>- Do you think that --  - I do.

732
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:24,640
<33-21,BECKETT>给家人
<33-21,BECKETT>"With family."

733
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:27,740
<33-22,CASTLE>你妈妈打算把带子拿给你们
<33-22,CASTLE>She was bringing the tape to you --

734
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:29,950
<33-22,CASTLE>也许为了安全  想把带子给你爸爸保管
<33-22,CASTLE>Maybe to give it to your father for safekeeping.

735
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:32,200
<33-23,BECKETT>那就是说她被杀时  证据在她手上
<33-23,BECKETT>Which means she would have had it on her when she was killed.

736
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,550
<33-23,BECKETT>布莱肯理应拿到那盘带子的
<33-23,BECKETT>Bracken would've recovered that.

737
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:35,160
<33-24,CASTLE>但我们知道他没有
<33-24,CASTLE>Only, we know he didn't.

738
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,120
<33-24,CASTLE>不然他也不会一直在找它
<33-24,CASTLE>Otherwise, he wouldn't still be looking for it.

739
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:40,790
<33-25,BECKETT>我妈妈把带子放哪了
<33-25,BECKETT>So, what did she do with the tape?

740
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,100
<34-1,BECKETT>很抱歉  兄弟们
<34-1,BECKETT>Look, guys, I'm so sorry.

741
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:08,280
<34-2,ESPOSITO>别这样  是我们弄砸了
<34-2,ESPOSITO>Please. We're the ones who screwed up.

742
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,490
<34-3,RYAN>是我们让他们发现了你的行踪
<34-3,RYAN>We led them right to you.

743
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:11,050
<34-4,DONOVAN>看着他们俩  直到我回来
<34-4,DONOVAN>Keep them here till I get back.

744
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:13,040
<34-4,DONOVAN>我想亲自押送他们
<34-4,DONOVAN>I want to personally escort them to booking.

745
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:22,750
<34-5,BECKETT>-卡塞尔  -别道歉
