137
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:03,350
<5-2,LANIE PARISH>我需要你帮个忙  不能告诉哈维尔
<5-2,LANIE PARISH>I need a favor, but you can't tell Javi.

138
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,590
<5-3,RYAN>我不知道这样好不好
<5-3,RYAN>I don't know if I'm comfortable with that.

139
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,200
<5-4,LANIE>不是坏事
<5-4,LANIE>It's not bad.

140
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,730
<5-4,LANIE>只是
<5-4,LANIE>It's just...

141
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,250
<5-4,LANIE>我认识了个人  我喜欢他
<5-4,LANIE>I met a guy. I like him.

142
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,090
<5-4,LANIE>我想让你给他做个背景调查
<5-4,LANIE>And I want you to run a background check on him.

143
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:12,460
<5-5,RYAN>-真浪漫  -真的
<5-5,RYAN>- Romantic. - Seriously.

144
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,160
<5-6,LANIE>就当今社会  谁都不可信
<5-6,LANIE>In this day and age, you can't trust anyone.

145
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,580
<5-6,LANIE>我不想爱上他
<5-6,LANIE>I don't want to fall for the guy

146
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,380
<5-6,LANIE>然后又发现他
<5-6,LANIE>and then discover he's got a thing

147
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,910
<5-6,LANIE>是个杀人狂
<5-6,LANIE>for putting the lotion in the basket.

148
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,510
<5-7,RYAN>好吧  我替你查查
<5-7,RYAN>Okay. I'll, uh, check it out.

149
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,720
<5-8,JAVIER ESPOSITO>查什么
<5-8,JAVIER ESPOSITO>Check what out?

150
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,660
<5-9,RYAN>我的红疹
<5-9,RYAN>Uh, this, uh... This rash that I have.

151
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,230
<5-9,RYAN>我想问问蕾妮的医学意见
<5-9,RYAN>Yeah, I wanted to get Lanie's medical opinion on it.

152
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,300
<5-10,ESPOSITO>说太多了  哥们
<5-10,ESPOSITO>Too much information, bro.

153
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,100
<5-11,LANIE>我也那么说  回见了
<5-11,LANIE>Yeah, that's what I said. Later, boys.

154
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:35,230
<6-1,CASTLE>首先
<6-1,CASTLE>First thing we need to do

155
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:37,190
<6-1,CASTLE>我们得查到菲利普·哈里斯在办什么案子
<6-1,CASTLE>is figure out what case Phillip Harris was working on.

156
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,790
<6-1,CASTLE>他很可能是因此被杀
<6-1,CASTLE>Odds are, that's what got him killed.

157
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,840
<6-2,HAYLEY>我也喜欢可怕的杀人案
<6-2,HAYLEY>Look, I love a gruesome murder as much as the next girl,

158
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,720
<6-2,HAYLEY>但我们没有客户
<6-2,HAYLEY>but we don't have a client.

159
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:43,620
<6-2,HAYLEY>而取悦那个可笑的最强侦探协会
<6-2,HAYLEY>And impressing that ridiculous detective society

160
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,000
<6-2,HAYLEY>并非我的首要任务
<6-2,HAYLEY>isn't exactly on the top of my list.

161
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,160
<6-3,CASTLE>是我的首要任务
<6-3,CASTLE>Well, it's on mine.

163
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,560
<6-3,CASTLE>但首先看看是否有人知道
<6-3,CASTLE>But first, let's see if anyone knows

164
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,570
<6-3,CASTLE>我一年半前为什么要来这里
<6-3,CASTLE>what I was doing here a year and a half ago.

166
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,650
<6-4,CASTLE>嗯  肯定是这里
<6-4,CASTLE>Yeah. This is definitely the place.

167
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:06,780
<6-5,HUNGRY ORCHARD OWNER>午餐两位
<6-5,HUNGRY ORCHARD OWNER>Two for lunch?

168
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:11,740

<7-1,HUNGRY ORCHARD OWNER>The watch.

169
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,940
<8-1,HAYLEY>理查德  怎么回事
<8-1,HAYLEY>Richard. What's going on?

00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,740
<8-2,CASTLE>你18个月前就在这里
<8-2,CASTLE>You were here 18 months ago.

<8-3,HUNGRY ORCHARD OWNER>Uh, yeah. It's my place. So?

<8-4,HAYLEY>Do you recognize him?

173
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:21,350
<8-5,HUNGRY ORCHARD OWNER>不  我该认得吗
<8-5,HUNGRY ORCHARD OWNER>No, should I?

174
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:24,040
<8-6,CASTLE>我来过
<8-6,CASTLE>Uh, I was here about, um...

175
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,490
<8-6,CASTLE>我大概一年半前来过
<8-6,CASTLE>I was here about a year and a half ago.

176
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:29,510
<8-6,CASTLE>出了什么事  你吼过我
<8-6,CASTLE>Something happened. You yelled at me.

177
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:30,930
<8-7,HUNGRY ORCHARD OWNER>你是戴表那家伙
<8-7,HUNGRY ORCHARD OWNER>Oh, you're the guy with the watch.

178
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:31,590
<8-8,CASTLE>什么表
<8-8,CASTLE>What watch?

179
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:32,890
<8-9,HUNGRY ORCHARD OWNER>你拿不出钱
<8-9,HUNGRY ORCHARD OWNER>You -- You couldn't pay.

180
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:34,370
<8-9,HUNGRY ORCHARD OWNER>我本想报警的
<8-9,HUNGRY ORCHARD OWNER>And then I was gonna call the cops on you.

181
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,690
<8-9,HUNGRY ORCHARD OWNER>然后你把表给我作为抵押
<8-9,HUNGRY ORCHARD OWNER>And then, uh, you -- you gave me your watch to hold onto.

182
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:37,960
<8-9,HUNGRY ORCHARD OWNER>说你会回来取  但一直没回来
<8-9,HUNGRY ORCHARD OWNER>Said you were gonna come back for it, but you never came.

183
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,840
<8-10,CASTLE>-我有跟谁一起来吗  -没有
<8-10,CASTLE>- Was I with anybody? - Uh, no.

184
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,430
<8-12,CASTLE>我有跟谁说话吗
<8-12,CASTLE>Did I talk to anybody?

185
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:43,870
<8-12,CASTLE>我有告诉你我去过哪或者要去哪吗
<8-12,CASTLE>Did I tell you where I'd been or where I was going?

186
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:47,470
<8-13,HUNGRY ORCHARD OWNER>没有  你吃了饭  然后就走了
<8-13,HUNGRY ORCHARD OWNER>No. You, uh, just ate, and then you left.

187
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:49,290
<8-13,HUNGRY ORCHARD OWNER>还把表给了我
<8-13,HUNGRY ORCHARD OWNER>Uh, gave me your watch first.

188
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,550
<8-14,CASTLE>还在你这儿吗
<8-14,CASTLE>Do you still have the watch?

189
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:51,860
<8-15,HUNGRY ORCHARD OWNER>我最棒的一个助攻
<8-15,HUNGRY ORCHARD OWNER>Best wingman I ever had.

190
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,800
<8-16,CASTLE>看上去不眼熟
<8-16,CASTLE>That does not look familiar.

191
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,860
<8-16,CASTLE>而且是假货
<8-16,CASTLE>And it's a knock-off.

192
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,150
<8-16,CASTLE>但这是我们最新的线索
<8-16,CASTLE>But it's the freshest clue we have.

193
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:57,470
<8-16,CASTLE>我要赎回来
<8-16,CASTLE>I'll buy it back from you.

194
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,680
<8-17,HUNGRY ORCHARD OWNER>好吧
<8-17,HUNGRY ORCHARD OWNER>Sure.

195
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,510
<9-1,VERONICA HARRIS>我弟弟是对的
<9-1,VERONICA HARRIS>My brother was right.

196
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,730
<9-2,RYAN>什么对了
<9-2,RYAN>Right about what?

197
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:06,750
<9-2,RYAN>幽灵
<9-2,RYAN>The Phantom.

198
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:09,610
<9-3,VERONICA>菲利普在追查的连环杀手
<9-3,VERONICA>A serial killer Phillip was hunting.

199
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:13,570
<9-3,VERONICA>他查一宗失踪案时偶然发现的
<9-3,VERONICA>He stumbled onto it working a missing-persons case.

200
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:16,160
<9-4,ESPOSITO>我们没听说过绰号幽灵的在逃连环杀手啊
<9-4,ESPOSITO>We haven't heard of any active serials nicknamed The Phantom.

201
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,060
<9-5,VERONICA>所以菲利普才喊他幽灵
<9-5,VERONICA>That's why Phillip called him The Phantom --

202
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:20,680
<9-5,VERONICA>因为都没人知道他的存在
<9-5,VERONICA>because no one has any idea that he exists.

203
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,390
<9-5,VERONICA>据菲利普说  幽灵一直在
<9-5,VERONICA>According to Phillip, The Phantom had been

204
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,360
<9-5,VERONICA>洛杉矶和纽约杀人
<9-5,VERONICA>killing people in Los Angeles and New York

205
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,460
<9-5,VERONICA>已经有几年了
<9-5,VERONICA>for the last several years.

206
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,050
<9-6,ESPOSITO>两岸连环杀手
<9-6,ESPOSITO>A bicoastal serial killer?

207
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:29,520
<9-7,VERONICA>菲利普飞回洛杉矶之前
<9-7,VERONICA>Right before Phillip flew back to L.A.,

208
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,240
<9-7,VERONICA>他说他查到了突破性线索
<9-7,VERONICA>he told me that he'd had a break in the case,

209
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,740
<9-7,VERONICA>他很快就能查明幽灵的身份了
<9-7,VERONICA>that he was close to identifying The Phantom.

210
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,050
<9-7,VERONICA>他肯定是太接近真相了
<9-7,VERONICA>He must have gotten too close to the truth.

211
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:43,330
<10-1,LANIE>我调出了据说是幽灵杀害的人的尸检报告
<10-1,LANIE>I pulled autopsy reports on The Phantom's alleged victims.

212
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:46,410
<10-1,LANIE>共有七人  洛杉矶四名  纽约三名
<10-1,LANIE>Total of seven -- four in L.A., three in New York.

213
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:48,480
<10-1,LANIE>凶器都是刀
<10-1,LANIE>All seven were killed with a knife.

214
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,840
<10-2,RYAN>除了刀之外有其他规律吗
<10-2,RYAN>Any pattern besides the knife?

215
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:52,390
<10-3,LANIE>没有  被害人什么样的都有
<10-3,LANIE>No. The victims are all over the map.

216
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:55,620
<10-3,LANIE>四个男人  三个女人  种族和年龄都不同
<10-3,LANIE>Four men, three women. Different ethnicities and ages.

217
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,900
<10-3,LANIE>每个被害人都被割了点东西
<10-3,LANIE>Each of the victims had something removed --

218
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,240
<10-3,LANIE>耳朵  眼睛  手指
<10-3,LANIE>an ear, an eye, a finger.

219
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,490
<10-4,RYAN>为什么  这有什么重要
<10-4,RYAN>Why? What's the significance of that?

220
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:03,490
<10-5,LANIE>没有
<10-5,LANIE>There is none.

221
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:04,900
<10-5,LANIE>由于如此随机
<10-5,LANIE>And because of the randomness,

222
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,460
<10-5,LANIE>一直没人把这些案子联系起来
<10-5,LANIE>no one was able to connect the murders.

223
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:08,410
<10-5,LANIE>除了菲利普·哈里斯
<10-5,LANIE>Until Phillip Harris, of course.

224
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:09,870
<10-6,ESPOSITO>那么菲利普是对的
<10-6,ESPOSITO>So Phillip was right.

225
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:11,140
<10-6,ESPOSITO>的确有名连环杀手
<10-6,ESPOSITO>A serial killer's been hunting

226
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,670
<10-6,ESPOSITO>在洛杉矶和纽约做案三年
<10-6,ESPOSITO>in L.A. And New York for three years

227
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:14,260
<10-6,ESPOSITO>而完全未被发现
<10-6,ESPOSITO>completely under the radar.

228
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,860
<11-1,CASTLE>跑这么远毫无进展
<11-1,CASTLE>All this way for a dead end.

229
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,840
<11-2,HAYLEY>或许也好  无知是福
<11-2,HAYLEY>Oh, it might be for the best. Ignorance is bliss.

230
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,290
<11-3,CASTLE>不  无知是地狱
<11-3,CASTLE>No, ignorance is hell.

231
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:22,280
<11-4,CHAUFFEUR>卡塞尔先生
<11-4,CHAUFFEUR>Mr. Castle.

233
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,040
<11-5,CASTLE>最强侦探协会要我去他们的总部
<11-5,CASTLE>The GDS is requesting my presence at headquarters.

234
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,190
<11-5,CASTLE>那么我一定是通过了他们的测试
<11-5,CASTLE>This must mean I passed their test

235
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,800
<11-5,CASTLE>他们要我加入他们
<11-5,CASTLE>and they want me to join their ranks.

236
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,260
<11-6,HAYLEY>真不想戳破
<11-6,HAYLEY>I hate to burst your fanboy bubble,

237
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,160
<11-6,HAYLEY>但你怎么知道这没问题
<11-6,HAYLEY>but how do you know this is on the up-and-up?

238
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,710
<11-7,CASTLE>-这没问题吧  -是  先生
<11-7,CASTLE>- Is this on the up-and-up? - Yes, sir.

239
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:42,750
<11-9,CASTLE>你干什么呢
<11-9,CASTLE>What are you doing?

240
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,110
<11-10,HAYLEY>照看你
<11-10,HAYLEY>Watching your back.

241
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:48,860
<12-1,CASTLE>我们有...
<12-1,CASTLE>Uh, we have...

242
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:53,730
<12-2,HAYLEY>你好
<12-2,HAYLEY>Hello.

243
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,620
<12-2,HAYLEY>卡塞尔先生  希普顿女士

<12-4,CASTLE>我简直不敢相信我在这里
<12-4,CASTLE>I cannot even believe I'm here.

248
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:03,630
<12-4,CASTLE>这就是梦想成真
<12-4,CASTLE>This is a dream come true.

249
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:05,600
<12-5,MASON WOOD>多谢你这么说
<12-5,MASON WOOD>That's very kind of you to say.

250
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,760
<12-5,MASON WOOD>我们协会有悠久丰富的历史
<12-5,MASON WOOD>Our society has a long and rich history,

251
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,740
<12-5,MASON WOOD>我们的会员遍及各个大陆
<12-5,MASON WOOD>and our membership expands every continent,

252
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,870

253
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:14,360
<12-6,CASTLE>-那里没几个杀人犯  -是啊
<12-6,CASTLE>- Not too many murders there. - No. No.

254
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:17,400
<12-7,MASON WOOD>不过  但我2007年发现了一艘藏在冰山里的
<12-7,MASON WOOD>Although, I did find a lost Chinese treasure ship

255
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,230
<12-8,MASON WOOD>失落的中国宝藏船
<12-8,MASON WOOD>hidden in an iceberg -- 2007.

256
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,560
<12-8,MASON WOOD>我也不想如此
<12-8,MASON WOOD>Now, I hate to do this,

257
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,750
<12-8,MASON WOOD>但我得单独跟卡塞尔先生谈谈
<12-8,MASON WOOD>but I need to speak to Mr. Castle alone.

258
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,370
<12-8,MASON WOOD>-你一定理解吧  希普顿女士  -不行
<12-8,MASON WOOD>- I'm sure you understand, Ms. Shipton. - No.

259
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:30,170
<12-9,HAYLEY>如果需要  我可以留在这里
<12-9,HAYLEY>I can stay here, if that's what you mean.

00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:32,540
<12-10,MASONS WOOD>太好了  这边请
<12-10,MASONS WOOD>Excellent. This way.

261
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:40,400
<13-1,MASON WOOD>可以看到  我们召集来了几位会员
<13-1,MASON WOOD>As you can see, we have assembled a few of our members.

262
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:47,750
<13-2,CASTLE>我认得你
<13-2,CASTLE>I know you.

263
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,380
<13-2,CASTLE>你之前去了犯罪现场
<13-2,CASTLE>You were at the crime scene.

264
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:51,410
<13-2,CASTLE>你是个警察
<13-2,CASTLE>You're a cop.

265
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:53,920
<13-3,KENDALL FROST>不  但我穿制服很像样
<13-3,KENDALL FROST>No, but I wear the hell out of a uniform.

266
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,180
<13-4,MASON WOOD>这位是肯德尔·弗罗斯特
<13-4,MASON WOOD>This is Kendall Frost.

267
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:58,020
<13-4,MASON WOOD>她是位旧金山的私家侦探
<13-4,MASON WOOD>She's a private detective based out of San Francisco.

268
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,150
<13-5,CASTLE>我恐怕有点糊涂
<13-5,CASTLE>I'm afraid I'm a little confused.

269
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:02,360
<13-5,CASTLE>我们来这里究竟是做什么
<13-5,CASTLE>What exactly are we doing here?

270
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,690
<13-6,MASON WOOD>菲利普·哈里斯曾是我们协会的成员
<13-6,MASON WOOD>Phillip Harris was a member of our society.

271
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:08,800
<13-6,MASON WOOD>他的死是莫大的惨剧
<13-6,MASON WOOD>His death is a tragedy.

272
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,960
<13-6,MASON WOOD>但对你或者弗罗斯特小姐也是个机会
<13-6,MASON WOOD>But it is also an opportunity for you or Ms. Frost.

273
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,270
<13-6,MASON WOOD>菲利普的死让我们协会有了空位
<13-6,MASON WOOD>Phillip's death has left an opening in our ranks.

274
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:20,690
<13-6,MASON WOOD>你们之中破了他的案子的人  就可以受邀
<13-6,MASON WOOD>Whichever one of you solves his murder will be invited in.

284
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:32,200
<14-1,CASTLE>菲利普·哈里斯是对的
<14-1,CASTLE>Phillip Harris was right.

285
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:34,120
<14-1,CASTLE>的确有个在东西海岸
<14-1,CASTLE>There is a phantom serial killer

286
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,490
<14-1,CASTLE>杀人的幽灵连环杀手
<14-1,CASTLE>murdering people on both coasts.

287
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:36,440
<14-2,HAYLEY>真聪明
<14-2,HAYLEY>That's clever.

288
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,730
<14-2,HAYLEY>分开下手
<14-2,HAYLEY>Splitting up his hunting ground

289
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,320
<14-2,HAYLEY>让大家不发现他
<14-2,HAYLEY>kept everyone from knowing his existence.

290
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,050
<14-2,HAYLEY>-他们查到线索了吗  -只有一条
<14-2,HAYLEY>- Did the boys get any leads? - Just one.

291
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:42,560
<14-3,CASTLE>他姐姐说菲利普·哈里斯
<14-3,CASTLE>His sister said that Phillip Harris

292
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,190
<14-3,CASTLE>之前在顶点影业做卧底
<14-3,CASTLE>was working undercover at Zenith Studios.

293
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:46,020
<14-4,ALEXIS>就是他们搞砸了
<14-4,ALEXIS>Oh, they're the ones

294
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,520
<14-4,ALEXIS>妮基·希特电影系列
<14-4,ALEXIS>that ruined the Nikki Heat movie franchise.

295
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:52,080
<14-5,CASTLE>不是搞砸  是毁了  彻底毁了
<14-5,CASTLE>Not ruined -- destroyed, terminated,

296
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:55,840
<14-5,CASTLE>消灭  汽化  根除
<14-5,CASTLE>extirpated, vaporized, eviscerated.

297
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,060
<14-6,HAYLEY>你想把所有近义词都说一遍吗
<14-6,HAYLEY>Do you plan on running through the full thesaurus?

298
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,950
<14-7,CASTLE>不  差不多可以了
<14-7,CASTLE>No. I think that'll about do it.

299
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:01,450
<14-7,CASTLE>总之  菲利普认为
<14-7,CASTLE>Anyway, Phillip thought

300
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:03,790
<14-7,CASTLE>顶点影业的什么人就是幽灵
<14-7,CASTLE>someone at Zenith Studios was The Phantom.

301
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:04,770
<14-8,ALEXIS>有可能
<14-8,ALEXIS>Makes sense.

302
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,800
<14-8,ALEXIS>很多跟电影业有关的人都东西海岸来回跑
<14-8,ALEXIS>Plenty of people connected with the film industry are bicoastal.

303
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,880
<14-9,HAYLEY>导演  制片人  摄影师
<14-9,HAYLEY>Directors, producers, cinematographers...

304
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,640
<14-10,CASTLE>演员  他们都差不多是反社会
<14-10,CASTLE>And actors, who are all borderline sociopaths, by the way.

305
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,790
<14-10,CASTLE>这还用你说
<14-10,CASTLE>Don't have to tell me.

306
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:15,860
<14-11,HAYLEY>顶点有人知道
<14-11,HAYLEY>Hey, did anyone at Zenith

307
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,390
<14-11,HAYLEY>菲利普是在那儿卧底吗
<14-11,HAYLEY>know that Phillip was working there undercover?

308
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:18,870
<14-12,CASTLE>只有一个人  影业老板
<14-12,CASTLE>Just one -- head of the studio.

309
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,360
<14-13,HAYLEY>我们去找他问话吧
<14-13,HAYLEY>Ah. Let's go talk to him.

00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,810
<15-1,CASTLE>最强侦探协会的位置
<15-1,CASTLE>in the Greatest Detective Society.

314
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:28,600
<15-1,CASTLE>肯德尔肯定没办法
<15-1,CASTLE>I mean, there's no way Kendall has access

315
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,010
<15-1,CASTLE>知道我了解的那些信息
<15-1,CASTLE>to the kind of details that I have.

316
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:32,100
<15-2,HAYLEY>别自大  里克  我们还没解决杀人案呢
<15-2,HAYLEY>Oh, don't get cocky, Rick. You haven't solved the murder yet.

329
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,210
<15-12,CASTLE>就因为我不肯让你参与妮基·希特电影
<15-12,CASTLE>'cause I wouldn't let you get cast in the Nikki Heat movie.

330
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:53,450
<15-13,COURTNEY>但我当时不知道  而现在知道的是

00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:58,970
<15-13,COURTNEY>没有被选入你的电影
<15-13,COURTNEY>Not being cast in your movie

334

<16-7,TREVOR>Now, look, I know this studio

354
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,840
<16-7,TREVOR>在《希特袭来》的制作上很差劲
<16-7,TREVOR>did a poor job producing Heatwave,

355
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,150
<16-7,TREVOR>但相信我  我为你的规划努力争取来着
<16-7,TREVOR>but believe me, I fought for your vision.

356

<16-7,TREVOR>现在  我是影业老板了
<16-7,TREVOR>And now that I am running the studio,

359
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,970
<16-8,CASTLE>但我们其实不是为了我的书而来
<16-8,CASTLE>But we're not actually here about my books.

360
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:56,070
<16-8,CASTLE>我们是在调查菲利普·哈里斯的死
<16-8,CASTLE>We're actually looking into the murder of Phillip Harris.

361
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:57,720
<16-9,TREVOR>我听说了  令人震惊
<16-9,TREVOR>Yes, I heard about that. It was shocking.

362
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:59,600
<16-9,TREVOR>菲尔是个大好人
<16-9,TREVOR>Phil was a great guy.

363
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,900
<16-9,TREVOR>他几年前救了我一命
<16-9,TREVOR>He saved my ass a couple of years ago.

364

385
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:34,630
<16-19,TREVOR>他提前叫停了拍摄  然后离开了
<16-19,TREVOR>he shut down production early and took off.

<16-20,CASTLE>他什么时候离开的
<16-20,CASTLE>About what time did he leave the lot?

<16-21,TREVOR>听说是11点左右  怎么了
<16-21,TREVOR>I heard around 11:00. Why?

388
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,870
<16-22,CASTLE>那他有的是时间赶往公墓
<16-22,CASTLE>Giving him lots of time to get to that cemetery.

389
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,910
<16-22,CASTLE>1号摄影棚在哪
<16-22,CASTLE>Where do we find Stage 1?

<17-1,CASTLE>So, how do you want to play this?

393
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:57,540
<18-1,HAYLEY>如果是他杀了菲利普·哈里斯
<18-1,HAYLEY>Well, if he did kill Phillip Harris,

394
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,580
<18-2,CASTLE>他肯定很小心  我们不能让他知道
<18-2,CASTLE>he's bound to be on guard, so we can't let him know

395
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,780
<18-2,CASTLE>我们把他当做嫌疑人
<18-2,CASTLE>that we are looking at him as a suspect.

396
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:04,320
<18-3,HAYLEY>-肯德尔  -她真厉害
<18-3,HAYLEY>- Kendall?! - Oh, she's good.

397
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,920
<18-4,CASTLE>她怎么会这么快就找到了奥斯汀
<18-4,CASTLE>How did she get onto Austin so quick?

398
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,230
<18-4,CASTLE>我们完了
<18-4,CASTLE>We're done for.

00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:10,530
<18-4,CASTLE>她已经把他迷住了
<18-4,CASTLE>She's already got him wrapped around her skinny, little finger.

400
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,880
<18-5,HAYLEY>别说我没为你做过什么
<18-5,HAYLEY>Don't say I never did anything for you.

<18-16,AUSTIN>-今晚再见  -当然
<18-16,AUSTIN>- See you ladies tonight. - Absolutely.

412
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:50,840
<18-18,KENDALL>你开什么玩笑
<18-18,KENDALL>Are you kidding me with this?

413
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,890
<18-19,HAYLEY>得了  亲爱的
<18-19,HAYLEY>Oh, come on, sweetie.

414
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,150
<18-19,HAYLEY>爱和凶杀案调查都是无所不用其极的
<18-19,HAYLEY>All's fair in love and murder investigations.

415
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:55,450
<18-20,KENDALL>你当这是游戏吗
<18-20,KENDALL>What, do you think this is a game?

416
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:57,740
<18-21,CASTLE>虽然你俩打架会很性感
<18-21,CASTLE>As hot as it would be to see you two fight --

417
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:58,930
<18-21,CASTLE>尤其是经过了那一吻
<18-21,CASTLE>especially after that kiss --

418
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:00,900
<18-21,CASTLE>我们得一起合作
<18-21,CASTLE>we need to work together on this.

419
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,410
<18-21,CASTLE>这样对我们都有利
<18-21,CASTLE>It is in all our best interests.

420
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:06,060
<18-22,KENDALL>好吧  我们合作
<18-22,KENDALL>All right. We'll work together.

421
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,750
<18-22,KENDALL>暂时的
<18-22,KENDALL>For now.

422
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:12,290
<18-23,CASTLE>这样正好
<18-23,CASTLE>This is actually gonna work out great.

423
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:14,460
<18-23,CASTLE>你和肯德尔缠住奥斯汀
<18-23,CASTLE>While you and Kendall keep Austin distracted,

424
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:16,810
<18-23,CASTLE>我就能去他家找出他是幽灵的证据了
<18-23,CASTLE>I'll search his house for proof that he's The Phantom.

425
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,910
<18-23,CASTLE>最强侦探协会的成员基本归我了
<18-23,CASTLE>Membership in the GDS is as good as mine.

426
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,480
<18-24,HAYLEY>你倒是高兴了
<18-24,HAYLEY>Oh, yay for you.

427
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,440
<18-24,HAYLEY>怎么了
<18-24,HAYLEY>What's wrong?

428
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,610
<18-25,CASTLE>是因为刚才跟肯德尔的吻吗
<18-25,CASTLE>Was it the kiss with Kendall?

429
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:23,900
<18-25,CASTLE>舌吻太多了吗
<18-25,CASTLE>Was it -- too much tongue?

430
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:24,640
<18-25,CASTLE>不够吗
<18-25,CASTLE>N-- not enough tongue?

431
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,130
<18-27,CASTLE>不怎么够
<18-27,CASTLE>N-- Well, not enough.

432
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:28,300
<18-26,HAYLEY>不是这事  肯德尔说得对  这不是比赛
<18-26,HAYLEY>No, Kendall was right. This is not a game.

433
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,660
<18-26,HAYLEY>如果奥斯汀·伊莱克拉真的是幽灵
<18-26,HAYLEY>If Austin Elektra is in fact The Phantom,

434
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:33,810
<18-26,HAYLEY>那我们就真的是要进虎穴了
<18-26,HAYLEY>then we are walking right into the lair of a serial killer.

435
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:36,280
<18-27,CASTLE>抱歉  "不够"后面的话再说一遍
<18-27,CASTLE>I'm sorry. Repeat everything you said after "Not enough."

436
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,900
<18-28,HAYLEY>上帝保佑
<18-28,HAYLEY>Oh, God help us.

438
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,320
<19-1,ESPOSITO>凯文
<19-1,ESPOSITO>Hey, Kev.

439
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:50,920
<19-2,RYAN>怎么了  搭档
<19-2,RYAN>What's up, partner?

440
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,830
<19-3,ESPOSITO>卡塞尔和海莉好像查到了些什么
<19-3,ESPOSITO>Castle and Hayley might be onto something.

441
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,560
<19-3,ESPOSITO>原来幽灵犯下两起谋杀案期间
<19-3,ESPOSITO>Turns out that movie director was in New York

442
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:56,190
<19-3,ESPOSITO>那个电影导演都在纽约
<19-3,ESPOSITO>during two of The Phantom's murders.

443
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:57,260
<19-4,RYAN>那第三起呢
<19-4,RYAN>What about the third?

444
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:57,990
<19-5,ESPOSITO>根据交易记录
<19-5,ESPOSITO>Based on financials,

445
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:59,800
<19-5,ESPOSITO>查不出那段时间奥斯汀在哪
<19-5,ESPOSITO>there's no indication of where Austin was.

446
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,840
<19-6,RYAN>也就是说他有可能在纽约
<19-6,RYAN>Which means he could have been here

447
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,530
<19-6,RYAN>犯下了第三起凶杀案
<19-6,RYAN>committing that third New York homicide.

448
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:03,260
<19-6,RYAN>他可能就是凶手
<19-6,RYAN>This could be our guy.

449
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,270
<19-7,ESPSOITO>是的  我会继续查的
<19-7,ESPSOITO>Yeah, I'm gonna keep digging.

450
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,680
<19-7,ESPSOITO>还有个事
<19-7,ESPSOITO>Oh, and...

451
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,010
<19-7,ESPSOITO>这是怎么回事  兄弟
<19-7,ESPSOITO>what is this, bro?

452
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,510
<19-8,ESPOSITO>你瞒着我什么
<19-8,ESPOSITO>What are you hiding from me,

453
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:16,500
<19-8,ESPOSITO>这个泰勒·罗斯是谁
<19-8,ESPOSITO>and who is Tyler Ross,

454
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,700
<19-8,ESPOSITO>还有你为什么要查他背景
<19-8,ESPOSITO>and why are you running a background check on him?

455
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,010
<19-9,RYAN>他谁也不是
<19-9,RYAN>Tyler's nobody.

456
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:22,730
<19-9,RYAN>好吧  是这样  珍妮和我
<19-9,RYAN>Well, you see, okay, Jenny a-and I,

457
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:24,680
<19-9,RYAN>想要雇一个新保姆
<19-9,RYAN>we're looking to have a new nanny.

458
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,720
<19-9,RYAN>或者应该说  是男保姆
<19-9,RYAN>Or in Tyler's case, a -- a manny.

459
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:28,730
<19-9,RYAN>-什么  -是的
<19-9,RYAN>- What? - Yeah.

460
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,180
<19-10,ESPOSITO>别装了
<19-10,ESPOSITO>Stop it.

461
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,370
<19-10,ESPOSITO>你简直太不会说谎了
<19-10,ESPOSITO>You're, like, the worst liar ever.

462
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:35,010
<19-10,ESPOSITO>这个人是谁
<19-10,ESPOSITO>Who is this guy?

463
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:36,810
<19-11,RYAN>他是蕾妮的新男友
<19-11,RYAN>He's Lanie's new boyfriend.

464
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:40,440
<19-11,RYAN>她想让我查一下他  而且不告诉你
<19-11,RYAN>She wanted me to check him out but not to tell you.

465
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:45,760
<19-11,RYAN>你知道这意味着什么吧
<19-11,RYAN>You know what this means, right?

466
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:51,750
<19-12,ESPOSITO>我们可以耍一下蕾妮了
<19-12,ESPOSITO>We... are gonna have some fun at Lanie's expense.

467
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:56,320
<20-1,RYAN>蕾妮
<20-1,RYAN>Hey, Lanie.

468
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:57,610
<20-1,RYAN>我收到你的短信了
<20-1,RYAN>I got your text.

469
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:58,780
<20-2,LANIE>我给你找到凶器了
<20-2,LANIE>And I've got your murder weapon --

470
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,370
<20-2,LANIE>应该说是凶器的图片
<20-2,LANIE>a picture of it, anyway.

471
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:05,030
<20-2,LANIE>我利用幽灵所杀的人的验尸报告生成了这个
<20-2,LANIE>I used the autopsies of The Phantom's victims to generate this.

472
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:11,620
<20-3,RYAN>靠近底部的锯齿很特别
<20-3,RYAN>Those serrations near the base are pretty distinctive.

473
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:12,540
<20-4,LANIE>没错
<20-4,LANIE>Exactly.

474
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,450
<20-4,LANIE>找到这把刀
<20-4,LANIE>Find the knife...

475
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:15,350
<20-5,RYAN>就能找到凶手  干得漂亮
<20-5,RYAN>Find the killer. Nice work.

476
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,480
<20-6,LANIE>那个  背景查得怎么样了
<20-6,LANIE>So, how's the background check going?

477
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,830
<20-7,RYAN>目前很好
<20-7,RYAN>Oh, pretty good so far.

478
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:22,750
<20-8,LANIE>听到你这么说我不安心啊
<20-8,LANIE>I don't like the sound of that.

479
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:25,230
<20-9,RYAN>没有  没什么可担心的
<20-9,RYAN>No, t-there's -- there's nothing to worry about...

480
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,220
<20-9,RYAN>目前为止
<20-9,RYAN>y-yet.

481
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,390
<20-9,RYAN>只是有些传言
<20-9,RYAN>It's -- it's just a rumor.

482
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,950
<20-10,LANIE>说来听听
<20-10,LANIE>Let's hear it.

483
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:30,810
<20-11,RYAN>好吧  他对小丑有特别的
<20-11,RYAN>Okay. He's got a thing about...

484
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:32,400
<20-11,RYAN>感觉
<20-11,RYAN>clowns.

485
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:34,390
<20-12,LANIE>没事啊  很多人都怕小丑呢
<20-12,LANIE>That's okay. Lots of people are afraid of clowns.

486
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:35,980
<20-13,RYAN>不不不  他不是怕小丑
<20-13,RYAN>Oh, no, no. He's not afraid of them.

487
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:37,380
<20-13,RYAN>他喜欢小丑
<20-13,RYAN>He likes them.

488
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,510
<20-14,LANIE>成癖好了吗
<20-14,LANIE>Like a fetish?

489
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,770
<20-14,LANIE>天哪
<20-14,LANIE>Oh, good Lord.

490
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:43,120
<20-15,RYAN>我还没有查证这一点
<20-15,RYAN>I-I haven't verified it yet.

491
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,540
<20-15,RYAN>我还要去问问他的一个前任
<20-15,RYAN>I still have to speak with one of his exes.

492
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,520
<20-16,LANIE>好吧  有消息通知我  行吗
<20-16,LANIE>Okay. Keep me posted, will you?

493
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:49,860
<21-1,CASTLE>莱恩  这太好了  谢谢你
<21-1,CASTLE>Ryan, that is excellent. Thank you.

494
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:53,760
<21-1,CASTLE>拖到明天早上再把它交给洛杉矶警察吧
<21-1,CASTLE>Now, just hold off on giving it to LAPD just until morning.

495
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,740
<21-1,CASTLE>我们有个计划来揪出幕后黑手
<21-1,CASTLE>We have a plan to expose who's behind this.

496
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,600
<21-2,HAYLEY>或者害死自己
<21-2,HAYLEY>Or get ourselves killed.

497
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:58,770
<21-3,CASTLE>打退堂鼓了吗
<21-3,CASTLE>Having second thoughts?

498
00:16:58,780 --> 00:16:59,750
<21-4,HAYLEY>跟一个从死者身上
<21-4,HAYLEY>About having a miage

499
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,210
<21-4,HAYLEY>取战利品的连环杀手会面吗
<21-4,HAYLEY>with a trophy-taking serial killer?

500
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:02,790
<21-4,HAYLEY>当然没有  怎么会出问题呢
<21-4,HAYLEY>No! What could possibly go wrong?

501
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,320
<21-5,CASTLE>听我说  这就是凶器
<21-5,CASTLE>Look, this is the murder weapon.

502
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,110
<21-5,CASTLE>你们需要做的就是缠住奥斯汀  争取时间
<21-5,CASTLE>All you have to do is distract Austin long enough

503
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:08,070
<21-5,CASTLE>让我找到这把刀
<21-5,CASTLE>for me to find this knife.

504
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:11,190
<21-6,HAYLEY>-希望它不要插在我们的背上  -嗯
<21-6,HAYLEY>- Let's just hope we don't find it in one of our backs. - Right.

505
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:16,350
<21-7,CASTLE>抱歉
<21-7,CASTLE>Sorry.

506
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,110
<21-9,CASTLE>我采取了一些
<21-9,CASTLE>I was setting up

507
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:19,230
<21-10,ALEXIS>反监控措施
<21-10,ALEXIS>a few counter-surveillance precautions.

508
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,750
<21-11,CASTLE>你觉得我们被监视了吗
<21-11,CASTLE>You think we're being bugged?

509
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,490
<21-12,ALEXIS>我们都不知道要去
<21-12,ALEXIS>We aren't sure exactly what or who

510
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:23,410
<21-12,ALEXIS>找谁或者找什么东西
<21-12,ALEXIS>we're looking for out here,

511
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:25,940
<21-12,ALEXIS>所以我觉得我们也不知道谁会在找我们
<21-12,ALEXIS>so I figured, we can't be sure who's looking for us.

512
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,000
<21-13,HAYLEY>那是什么引起了警报呢
<21-13,HAYLEY>So, what tripped the alarm?

513
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,980
<21-14,ALEXIS>可能传感器设置得太灵敏了
<21-14,ALEXIS>Maybe the sensor's turned up too high.

514
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,190
<21-15,HAYLEY>不是吧
<21-15,HAYLEY>I'll be damned.

515
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:38,060
<21-16,CASTLE>看来这块手表
<21-16,CASTLE>Looks like this watch is good for something

516
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:41,180
<21-16,CASTLE>不是只能用来在韩国餐厅抵账的
<21-16,CASTLE>other than taking care of checks at Korean restaurants.

517
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:46,200
<21-16,CASTLE>找到了
<21-16,CASTLE>Hello.

518
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,900
<21-17,HAYLEY>有人在手表的电池上
<21-17,HAYLEY>Someone has hard-wired a GPS transmitter

519
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,050
<21-17,HAYLEY>接了定位发射器
<21-17,HAYLEY>to the watch's battery.

520
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:51,250
<21-18,CASTLE>你觉得是中情局吗
<21-18,CASTLE>You think it's CIA,

521
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,950
<21-18,CASTLE>泰国那次任务后留下的
<21-18,CASTLE>left over from my Thailand mission?

522
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:54,820
<21-19,HAYLEY>有可能  不知道能不能查出来
<21-19,HAYLEY>Possible. Doubt we'll ever know for sure.

523
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,590
<21-20,ALEXIS>查不到这是在哪买的吗
<21-20,ALEXIS>Can't we track down where it was purchased?

524
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,370
<21-21,HAYLEY>查不到  这种发射器太常见了
<21-21,HAYLEY>No. I'm afraid this transmitter's incredibly common,

525
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,290
<21-21,HAYLEY>想要查出来简直是不可能的
<21-21,HAYLEY>which makes tracking it almost impossible.

526
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:02,830
<21-22,ALEXIS>那我们也要试一下  对吧
<21-22,ALEXIS>But we have to try, right?

527
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,250
<21-22,ALEXIS>这就是我们来这的初衷啊
<21-22,ALEXIS>I mean, it's why we're here.

528
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,000
<22-1,CASTLE>肯德尔
<22-1,CASTLE>Kendall.

529
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,710
<22-1,CASTLE>你真是放好了鱼饵
<22-1,CASTLE>You certainly have baited the hook.

530
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:10,210
<22-2,KENDALL>没办法  特别是考虑到
<22-2,KENDALL>I had to, especially considering

531
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:12,450
<22-2,KENDALL>今天晚上是二对一
<22-2,KENDALL>it's gonna be two against one tonight.

532
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,440
<22-3,CASTLE>你说什么呢
<22-3,CASTLE>What are you talking about?

533
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,890
<22-3,CASTLE>拜托  里奇
<22-3,CASTLE>Come on, Rick.

534
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:16,850
<22-4,KENDALL>我知道你会趁
<22-4,KENDALL>I know you're gonna sneak

535
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:18,430
<22-4,KENDALL>我和海莉缠住奥斯汀的时候
<22-4,KENDALL>into Austin's house to look for evidence

536
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,960
<22-4,KENDALL>溜进他家找证据
<22-4,KENDALL>while Hayley and I distract him.

537
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:22,150
<22-4,KENDALL>我不傻  可是如果你觉得你没这个
<22-4,KENDALL>I'm no fool, but you are if you think

538
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:24,740
<22-4,KENDALL>就能成功的话  你就太傻了
<22-4,KENDALL>your little plan will work without these.

539
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:27,610
<22-5,HAYLEY>奥斯汀·伊莱克拉家的结构图
<22-5,HAYLEY>Schematics to Austin Elektra's house.

540
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:28,460
<22-5,HAYLEY>你从哪搞到的
<22-5,HAYLEY>Where'd you get those?

541
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:29,950
<22-6,KENDALL>你这漂亮的小脑瓜就别管这个了
<22-6,KENDALL>Don't worry your pretty, little head about that.

542
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:30,930
<22-7,HAYLEY>漂亮吗
<22-7,HAYLEY>Pretty?

543
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,570
<22-8,KENDALL>海莉和我缠住奥斯汀的时候
<22-8,KENDALL>While Hayley and I distract Austin,

544
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,570
<22-8,KENDALL>你要找到这个
<22-8,KENDALL>you need to look for this.

545
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,290
<22-8,KENDALL>这是一面假墙
<22-8,KENDALL>It's a false wall.

546
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:38,680
<22-9,CASTLE>一间密室
<22-9,CASTLE>A secret room.

547
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,720
<22-9,CASTLE>这一定是奥斯汀收藏他被害人
<22-9,CASTLE>That would be the perfect place for Austin to hide

548
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,560
<22-9,CASTLE>可怕战利品的绝佳地方
<22-9,CASTLE>the grisly trophies he takes from his victims.

549
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,710
<22-9,CASTLE>没错
<22-9,CASTLE>Exactly.

550
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:48,300
<22-10,KENDALL>如果你能找到奥斯汀是凶手的证据
<22-10,KENDALL>Now, if you find evidence that Austin is the killer,

551
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,650
<22-10,KENDALL>功劳由我们平分
<22-10,KENDALL>I get equal credit.

552
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:51,090
<22-10,KENDALL>不能诳了我
<22-10,KENDALL>No double-crosses.

553
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,400
<22-11,CASTLE>成交
<22-11,CASTLE>Deal.

554
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,110
<22-11,CASTLE>这样  梅森·伍德得把咱俩都
<22-11,CASTLE>That way, Mason Wood has to make both of us

555
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:55,370
<22-11,CASTLE>收为协会成员
<22-11,CASTLE>members of the society.

556
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:56,260
<22-11,CASTLE>走吧
<22-11,CASTLE>Let's go.

557
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:58,180
<22-12,KENDALL>等一下  你就穿成这样去吗
<22-12,KENDALL>Hold on. Is that what you're wearing?

558
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,450
<22-13,CASTLE>-是的  -不是
<22-13,CASTLE>- Yes. - No.

559
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:00,900
<22-14,HAYLEY>让我想想是穿自己带来的
<22-14,HAYLEY>Deciding between something I brought

560
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,390
<22-14,HAYLEY>还是让里克再给我买一件
<22-14,HAYLEY>and something that Rick's about to buy me.

561
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:04,860
<22-15,CASTLE>我想我知道你倾向于哪个选择
<22-15,CASTLE>I think I know the direction you'll be leaning in.

562
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:09,250
<22-16,HAYLEY>你的确有资格加入最强侦探协会
<22-16,HAYLEY>You really do deserve to be in the Greatest Detective Society.

563
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:15,090
<23-1,AUSTIN>请进  请进
<23-1,AUSTIN>Come in, come in.

<23-1,AUSTIN>先来喝一杯
<23-1,AUSTIN>Let's get some drinks in you.

565
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,220
<23-2,AUSTIN>给
<23-2,AUSTIN>Here you go.

566
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,740
<23-4,AUSTIN>一些能让你放松的东西
<23-4,AUSTIN>A little something to loosen your inhibitions.

567
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:38,320
<23-5,HAYLEY>不用担心  我们已经很放松了
<23-5,HAYLEY>Oh, don't worry. We're plenty loose already.

568
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,280
<23-6,AUSTIN>等我把你绑起来就不会了
<23-6,AUSTIN>Not after I've tied you up.

569
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:45,910
<24-1,AUSTIN>谁先来
<24-1,AUSTIN>So, who's first?

570
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,030
<24-1,AUSTIN>要不这样
<24-1,AUSTIN>Tell you what.

571
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:09,030
<24-1,AUSTIN>让我先来绑你如何
<24-1,AUSTIN>Uh, why don't you let me tie you up first?

572
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:10,080
<25-1,HAYLEY>被绑住  我怎么进行
<25-1,HAYLEY>Then how am I gonna be able to do

573
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:12,410
<25-2,AUSTIN>那些计划好的坏事呢
<25-2,AUSTIN>all the terrible things that I've got planned for you?

574
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:14,900
<25-3,HAYLEY>我确定你会有办法的
<25-3,HAYLEY>Oh, I'm sure you'll figure something out.

575
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:16,900
<25-3,HAYLEY>不是吗  肯德尔
<25-3,HAYLEY>Isn't that right, Kendall?

576
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:17,990
<25-3,HAYLEY>肯德尔  肯德尔
<25-3,HAYLEY>Kendall -- Kendall?

577
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:18,900

<25-3,HAYLEY>Damn it.

578
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,730
<25-3,HAYLEY>她要错过所有的乐趣了
<25-3,HAYLEY>She's gonna miss all the fun.

579
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,900
<25-3,HAYLEY>你上当了
<25-3,HAYLEY>You've been had.

580
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,960
<26-1,CASTLE>那个该死的小
<26-1,CASTLE>That dirty little...

581
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,540
<26-1,CASTLE>我已经厌倦追着你跑了
<26-1,CASTLE>I'm getting tired of chasing you.

582
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,880
<26-1,CASTLE>休息片刻也无妨
<26-1,CASTLE>Well, there's no rule against taking a short break.

583
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:54,430
<26-1,CASTLE>怎么回事
<26-1,CASTLE>What the hell?

584
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,230
<26-1,CASTLE>你的朋友去哪了
<26-1,CASTLE>Hey, where's your friend?

585
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,130
<26-1,CASTLE>我以为我们说好的
<26-1,CASTLE>Thought we had a deal.

586
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:07,220
<28-1,CASTLE>不再互相欺骗
<28-1,CASTLE>No more double-crosses.

<28-2,CASTLE>抱歉  里克  不过我要成为
<28-2,CASTLE>Sorry, Ricky, but I am going to be the one

<28-4,CASTLE>Well, good luck with that,

590
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,550
<28-4,CASTLE>因为我在找一件谋杀凶器
<28-4,CASTLE>because I'm looking for a murder weapon.

591
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:17,510
<28-4,CASTLE>一种特殊形状的刀刃
<28-4,CASTLE>It's a unique blade,

592
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,930
<28-4,CASTLE>不过我想你并不知道这件事
<28-4,CASTLE>but I guess you wouldn't know that.

593
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:20,280
<28-5,KENDALL>-你说谎  -没有
<28-5,KENDALL>- You're lying. - No.

594
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:22,090
<28-6,CASTLE>它在这里
<28-6,CASTLE>And here it is.

595
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,730
<28-7,KENDALL>很好
<28-7,KENDALL>Okay, great.

596
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:25,740
<28-7,KENDALL>我们一起把它带走
<28-7,KENDALL>We'll take it in together.

597
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,540
<28-8,KENDALL>你说的  我们说好的  对吗
<28-8,KENDALL>Like you said, we have deal, right?

598
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:28,690
<28-9,CASTLE>所以现在说话又算话了吗
<28-9,CASTLE>Oh, so now the deal's back on?

599
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:29,880
<28-10,AUSTIN>放下那把刀
<28-10,AUSTIN>Drop the knife!

600
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:34,790
<28-11,CASTLE>奥斯汀  警察知道我们在这里
<28-11,CASTLE>Austin, the police know we're here.

601
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:36,990
<28-11,CASTLE>如果你杀了我们  他们会抓住你的
<28-11,CASTLE>If you kill us, they will catch you.

602
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:38,070
<28-12,AUSTIN>我不会杀了你们
<28-12,AUSTIN>I'm not gonna kill you.

603
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,450
<28-13,KENDALL>那你为什么拿枪口指着我们
<28-13,KENDALL>Then why are you holding us at gunpoint?

604
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:40,910
<28-14,AUSTIN>因为你们在抢劫我
<28-14,AUSTIN>Because you're robbing me?

605
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:41,870
<28-15,CASTLE>我们没有抢劫你
<28-15,CASTLE>We're not robbing you.

606
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:43,960
<28-15,CASTLE>我们在搜集你是连环杀人凶手的证据
<28-15,CASTLE>We're getting evidence that you are a serial killer.

607
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,720
<28-15,CASTLE>比如这把刀
<28-15,CASTLE>Like this knife,

608
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,430
<28-15,CASTLE>被用于七次仪式型谋杀中
<28-15,CASTLE>which as been used in seven ritualistic murders.

609
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:48,450
<28-15,CASTLE>你在说什么
<28-15,CASTLE>What are you talking about?

610
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:50,870
<28-16,AUSTIN>我才不是连环杀人凶手  我是个电影导演
<28-16,AUSTIN>I-I'm not a serial killer. I'm a film director.

611
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:53,570
<28-16,AUSTIN>那是我两年前拍的一部恐怖片里的道具
<28-16,AUSTIN>And that is a prop from a horror movie I shot two years ago.

612
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:54,790
<28-17,HAYLEY>不管是不是道具
<28-17,HAYLEY>Well, prop or not,

613
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:57,070
<28-17,HAYLEY>这把刀的形状和我们受害者的伤口完全吻合
<28-17,HAYLEY>this knife matches our victims' wounds exactly.

614
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:01,200
<28-18,AUSTIN>那部电影一共做了五把一模一样的刀
<28-18,AUSTIN>There were five identical knives made for that film,

615
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,950
<28-18,AUSTIN>也就是说还有四把这样的刀在其他地方
<28-18,AUSTIN>which means there are four others out there just like it.

616
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:05,510
<28-18,AUSTIN>也许你应该去找那其中的一把
<28-18,AUSTIN>Maybe you should be looking for one of those.

617
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:08,150
<28-19,CASTLE>但是其中三起谋杀你都在纽约
<28-19,CASTLE>But you were in New York for three of those murders.

618
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:10,650
<28-20,AUSTIN>还有其他八百万人也在  包括我的助手
<28-20,AUSTIN>So were 8 million other people, including my assistant,

619
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:13,150
<28-20,AUSTIN>他可以证明我所有的行踪
<28-20,AUSTIN>who can prove my whereabouts at all times.

620
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:15,600
<28-20,AUSTIN>现在滚出我的房子
<28-20,AUSTIN>Now get the hell out of my house!

621
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,690
<28-21,HAYLEY>你可不可以...好吧
<28-21,HAYLEY>Do you think you could...okay.

622
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:23,440
<29-1,ESPOSITO>导演说的是真话
<29-1,ESPOSITO>Well, the director was telling the truth.

623
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,380
<29-1,ESPOSITO>他在三起纽约谋杀中不在场证明都成立
<29-1,ESPOSITO>His alibis check out for all three New York murders.

624
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,160
<29-2,RYAN>我们得去追查一下为那部恐怖片
<29-2,RYAN>Then we need to track down all the knives

625
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,270
<29-2,RYAN>做的所有的刀
<29-2,RYAN>that were made for that horror movie.

626
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,100
<29-3,ESPOSITO>很显然其中的某一把
<29-3,ESPOSITO>Yeah. Clearly one of them

627
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,210
<29-3,ESPOSITO>被用来完成七次谋杀
<29-3,ESPOSITO>was used to commit all seven murders.

628
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:32,260
<29-4,LANIE>八次
<29-4,LANIE>There were eight.

629
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,680
<29-5,ESPOSITO>你在说什么
<29-5,ESPOSITO>W-What are you talking about?

630
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,440
<29-6,LANIE>我发现了第四个纽约被害人
<29-6,LANIE>I discovered a fourth New York victim --

631
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,420
<29-6,LANIE>一个叫帕特·克鲁斯的人
<29-6,LANIE>a man by the name of Pat Crews.

632
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:39,600
<29-7,RYAN>你确定
<29-7,RYAN>Are you sure?

633
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,300
<29-7,RYAN>菲利普·哈里斯只知道三起
<29-7,RYAN>Phillip Harris only knew about three.

634
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:43,210
<29-8,LANIE>他漏掉这一起是有原因的
<29-8,LANIE>There's a reason he missed this one.

635
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:45,730
<29-8,LANIE>因为这起谋杀和幽灵在洛杉矶杀死一名女子
<29-8,LANIE>Because this murder took place on the same day

636
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:48,540
<29-8,LANIE>发生在同一天
<29-8,LANIE>the Phantom killed a woman in Los Angeles.

637
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,960
<29-9,ESPOSITO>但这怎么可能
<29-9,ESPOSITO>But how can that be?

638
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,640
<29-9,ESPOSITO>除非
<29-9,ESPOSITO>Unless...

639
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:53,490
<29-10,RYAN>有两个连环杀人凶手
<29-10,RYAN>There are two serial killers,

640
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,240
<29-10,RYAN>一边一个
<29-10,RYAN>one on each coast.

641
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,670
<30-1,HAYLEY>-谁啊  -我不知道
<30-1,HAYLEY>- Who is that? - I don't know.

642
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,720
<30-2,CASTLE>不管是谁  我希望他们带了咖啡来
<30-2,CASTLE>Whoever it is, I hope they brought coffee.

643
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,280
<30-3,MENENDEZ>门德斯警探
<30-3,MENENDEZ>Detective Menendez.

644
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,400
<30-4,CASTLE>-要知道  -请进
<30-4,CASTLE>- You know... - Please come in.

645
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,510
<30-5,MENENDEZ>我想过会被
<30-5,MENENDEZ>...I expect to be screwed over

646
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:08,860
<30-5,MENENDEZ>某个不认识的蠢货坏事
<30-5,MENENDEZ>by an asshat that I don't know,

647
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:10,620
<30-5,MENENDEZ>但我没想到是被本该是朋友的人
<30-5,MENENDEZ>but not from one who's supposed to be my friend.

648
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:11,920
<30-6,HAYLEY>我想你是听说了昨天晚上
<30-6,HAYLEY>I take it that you heard about what happened

649
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,440
<30-6,HAYLEY>在奥斯汀·伊莱克拉家发生的事情
<30-6,HAYLEY>at Austin Elektra's house last night.

650
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,630
<30-7,MENENDEZ>你们说过会通知我案情进展
<30-7,MENENDEZ>You said you'd keep me in the loop.

651
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:15,780
<30-8,HAYLEY>我们可以解释
<30-8,HAYLEY>Look, we can explain.

652
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:19,700
<30-9,CASTLE>奥斯汀有一把符合凶器描述的道具刀
<30-9,CASTLE>Uh, Austin had a prop knife that matched the murder weapon.

653
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:21,680
<30-10,MENENDEZ>我们的实验室今天早晨检验了  不是它
<30-10,MENENDEZ>And our lab tested it this morning -- it's clean.

654
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:22,500
<30-11,HAYLEY>你有去追踪一下
<30-11,HAYLEY>Did you manage to track down

655
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,820
<30-11,HAYLEY>这部电影里用到的其他四把刀吗
<30-11,HAYLEY>the other four knives used in the movie?

656
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,440
<30-12,MENENDEZ>其中两把还在片厂室的仓库里
<30-12,MENENDEZ>Two of the knives are still at the studio warehouse.

657
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,670
<30-12,MENENDEZ>也不是它们
<30-12,MENENDEZ>They came up clean, too.

658
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:27,810
<30-12,MENENDEZ>据道具师说
<30-12,MENENDEZ>And according to the prop master --

659
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:29,810
<30-12,MENENDEZ>顺便说一句他的不在场证明已经核实
<30-12,MENENDEZ>who alibied out, by the way --

660
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:31,550
<30-12,MENENDEZ>最后的两把刀不翼而飞
<30-12,MENENDEZ>the last two knives went missing.

661
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:33,710
<30-13,CASTLE>蕾妮发现有两个不同的凶手
<30-13,CASTLE>Well, Lanie discovered there are two different murderers

662
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:36,700
<30-13,CASTLE>分别在各自的海岸用相同的凶器作案
<30-13,CASTLE>operating on either coast using identical weapons.

663
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:37,570
<30-13,CASTLE>我们所需要做的就是
<30-13,CASTLE>All we have to do --

664
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:38,700
<30-14,MENENDEZ>不  不  不
<30-14,MENENDEZ>Oh, whoa, whoa. No, no, no.

665
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:41,660
<30-14,MENENDEZ>没有什么我们  你们两个到此为止
<30-14,MENENDEZ>T-there is no "We." You two are done.

666
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:43,920
<30-14,MENENDEZ>如果我发现你们其中的哪一个继续查这个案子
<30-14,MENENDEZ>And if I catch either of you working this case,

667
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,300
<30-14,MENENDEZ>我就以扰乱公务的罪名逮捕你们两个
<30-14,MENENDEZ>I'll have you both arrested for obstruction.

668
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:50,100
<30-15,HAYLEY>别别别
<30-15,HAYLEY>No, no, no, no. Mm.

669
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:53,070
<30-16,CASTLE>也许一瓶小小的苏格兰纯麦威士忌
<30-16,CASTLE>Hey, maybe a little single malt scotch

670
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:54,280
<30-16,CASTLE>可以揭过这页
<30-16,CASTLE>will smooth things over?

671
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:55,510
<30-17,MENENDEZ>滚回去
<30-17,MENENDEZ>Go home.

672
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:58,480
<30-18,MENENDEZ>打扰一下
<30-18,MENENDEZ>Excuse me.

673
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:00,820
<30-19,BELLBOY>这个刚送来是给你的  卡塞尔先生
<30-19,BELLBOY>T-this just came for you, Mr. Castle.

674
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:03,170
<30-20,CASTLE>谢了
<30-20,CASTLE>Oh. Um...thanks.

675
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:09,920
<30-21,CASTLE>看起来门德斯不是唯一一个
<30-21,CASTLE>Looks like Menendez isn't the only one

676
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,690
<30-21,CASTLE>对昨晚感到不满的人
<30-21,CASTLE>unhappy about last night.

677
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,090
<30-21,CASTLE>梅森要立刻见肯德尔和我
<30-21,CASTLE>Mason wants to see Kendall and me right away.

678
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:15,200
<30-22,HAYLEY>好运
<30-22,HAYLEY>Good luck.

679
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,710
<30-23,HAYLEY>那是什么
<30-23,HAYLEY>What's that?

680
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:21,700
<30-24,CASTLE>这是报复
<30-24,CASTLE>This is payback.

681
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:24,140
<31-1,MASON WOOD>感谢前来赴约
<31-1,MASON WOOD>Thanks for coming in.

682
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:25,890
<31-2,CASTLE>其他人都去哪了
<31-2,CASTLE>Where is everyone else?

683
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:29,340
<31-3,MASON WOOD>他们对你俩的热情
<31-3,MASON WOOD>Their enthusiasm for both of you waned

684
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:32,040
<31-3,MASON WOOD>在昨晚的所作所为之后消退了
<31-3,MASON WOOD>after the way you conducted yourselves last night.

685
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:35,720
<31-3,MASON WOOD>简直杂乱无章  横冲直撞  缺乏我们期望
<31-3,MASON WOOD>It was messy, boarish, lacking the sophistication

686
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,070
<31-3,MASON WOOD>任何潜在会员所应有的心思缜密
<31-3,MASON WOOD>we expect from any potential member.

687
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:39,020
<31-5,CASTLE>-是她的错  -是他的错
<31-5,CASTLE>- It was her fault. - It was his fault.

688
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:42,270
<31-6,MASON WOOD>不  是我的错
<31-6,MASON WOOD>No, it was my fault,

689
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:43,680
<31-6,MASON WOOD>想着你们中会有一个
<31-6,MASON WOOD>thinking that either of you

690
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,600
<31-6,MASON WOOD>能接替菲利普
<31-6,MASON WOOD>could ever have filled Phillip's shoes.

691
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,880
<31-7,CASTLE>伍德先生  请再给我次机会
<31-7,CASTLE>Mr. Wood, please. Give me another chance.

692
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,780
<31-8,KENDALL>不  我来吧
<31-8,KENDALL>No, give me another chance.

693
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:51,280
<31-8,KENDALL>我会找到菲利普的杀手
<31-8,KENDALL>I will find Phillip's killer.

694
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,630
<31-9,CASTLE>她做不了  她这期间都落后我两步
<31-9,CASTLE>She won't. She's been two steps behind me this whole time.

695
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:54,780
<31-10,KENDALL>落后
<31-10,KENDALL>Behind you?

696
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,160
<31-10,KENDALL>我先找到奥斯汀的
<31-10,KENDALL>I got to Austin first.

697
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,530
<31-10,KENDALL>而我找到了那把刀
<31-10,KENDALL>And I got to the knife.

698
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:59,350
<31-11,CASTLE>虽然它不是真正的凶器
<31-11,CASTLE>And although it wasn't the actual murder weapon,

699
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:01,700
<31-11,CASTLE>但多亏我在纽约警局有联系人
<31-11,CASTLE>thank you to my contacts at the NYPD,

<33-5,HAYLEY>Sure, we could do that.

753

<33-7,HAYLEY>But what happens when your father starts

759

764
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:24,860
<33-7,HAYLEY>对他来说更安全  不是吗
<33-7,HAYLEY>to maybe not remember what happened?

765

<38-6,RYAN>One for yourself, one for your partner out in Los Angeles?

816
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,140
<38-7,JORDAN>你俩在说什么
<38-7,JORDAN>What are you guys talking about?

817
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:56,150
<38-8,RYAN>帕特·克鲁斯  你以前的写作老师
<38-8,RYAN>We're talking about Pat Crews, your old writing teacher.

818
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,780
<38-9,ESPOSITO>他被一把跟那一样的刀杀了
<38-9,ESPOSITO>He was killed with a knife shaped exactly like that one.

819
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:08,810
<38-10,ESPOSITO>放下
<38-10,ESPOSITO>Drop it!

820
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:09,480
<38-11,WOMAN>救救我
<38-11,WOMAN>Help me!

821
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,790
<38-12,RYAN>-快放了她乔丹  -退后
<38-12,RYAN>- Let her go, Jordan. - Stand back!

822
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:12,630
<38-14,ESPOSITO>你无路可走了  把剪刀放下
<38-14,ESPOSITO>You got no where to go. Drop the scissors.

823
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:13,890
<38-15,JORDAN>听着伙计们  我是个作家
<38-15,JORDAN>Listen, fellas, I'm a writer,

824
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:16,700
<38-15,JORDAN>相信我  要是坏人投降的话
<38-15,JORDAN>so trust me when I say if the villain surrenders,

825
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,990
<38-15,JORDAN>这也太不过瘾了
<38-15,JORDAN>oh, it's just so unsatisfying!

826
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:21,120
<38-15,JORDAN>所以他们总是"死得其所"
<38-15,JORDAN>That's why they always go out in style.

827
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:23,720
<38-16,ESPOSITO>放松  乔丹
<38-16,ESPOSITO>Just relax, Jordan.

828
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,910
<38-17,RYAN>别干蠢事
<38-17,RYAN>Don't do anything stupid.

829
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:26,580
<38-18,JORDAN>蠢  我吗
<38-18,JORDAN>Stupid? Me?

830
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:29,500
<38-18,JORDAN>你怎么能这么说  这么多年把你们蒙在鼓里
<38-18,JORDAN>How can you say that when we've outsmarted you for years?

831
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,650
<38-19,ESPOSITO>"我们"是谁  你洛杉矶的同伙是谁
<38-19,ESPOSITO>Who's "We"? Who's your partner in L.A.?

832
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:32,900
<38-20,JORDAN>一个天才
<38-20,JORDAN>A genius.

833
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:35,920
<38-20,JORDAN>他信任我  将我的构想变成现实
<38-20,JORDAN>He believed in me. Took my visions, made them real.

834
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,080
<38-21,RYAN>告诉我们名字  乔丹
<38-21,RYAN>Give us a name, Jordan.

835
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,410
<38-22,JORDAN>你永远都找不到他
<38-22,JORDAN>You'll never find him.

836
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:51,110
<39-1,CASTLE>好的  没事  我理解  谢谢
<39-1,CASTLE>Okay. No, I understand. Thank you.

837
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:53,660
<39-1,CASTLE>是莱恩和埃斯波西托
<39-1,CASTLE>That was Ryan and Esposito.

838
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:55,430
<39-1,CASTLE>他们不得已杀了乔丹·基根
<39-1,CASTLE>They had to kill Jordan Keegan.

839
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:58,220
<39-1,CASTLE>但他们把乔丹电脑里的文件拷贝发过来了
<39-1,CASTLE>But they sent us digital copies of Jordan's computer.

840
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:00,600
<39-1,CASTLE>我觉得我们  "我们"是指你们两个
<39-1,CASTLE>Now, I think we -- and by "We", I mean the two of you --

841
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,830
<39-1,CASTLE>也许能在里面找到些什么
<39-1,CASTLE>might be able to find something on there

842
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,460
<39-1,CASTLE>可以给我们线索找到他在西海岸的同伙
<39-1,CASTLE>that'll give us a lead to find his West Coast counterpart.

843
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:06,490
<39-2,HAYLEY>里克  我们得谈谈
<39-2,HAYLEY>Rick, we need to talk.

844
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:07,350
<39-3,CASTLE>谈什么
<39-3,CASTLE>About what?

845
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:10,050
<39-4,ALEXIS>你们俩单独谈谈
<39-4,ALEXIS>I'll give you two the room.

846
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:17,750
<39-5,HAYLEY>你还记得我们第一次见面的时候吗
<39-5,HAYLEY>You remember when we first met?

847
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:18,720
<39-6,CASTLE>我怎么能忘呢
<39-6,CASTLE>How could I forget?

848
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,280
<39-6,CASTLE>你冷不丁冲我脸上打了一拳
<39-6,CASTLE>You sucker-punched me in the face.

849
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,440
<39-7,HAYLEY>不  不是  我们之前就见过
<39-7,HAYLEY>No. No, we'd met before that.

850
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:25,940
<39-7,HAYLEY>确切地来说是一年半以前
<39-7,HAYLEY>A year and a half earlier, to be precise.

851
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:29,910
<39-8,CASTLE>你是说整段时间以来你都知道
<39-8,CASTLE>You mean this whole time you knew?

852
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:31,750
<39-8,CASTLE>你到底是谁
<39-8,CASTLE>Who the hell are you?

853
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:34,670
<39-9,HAYLEY>我是海莉  这个我没撒谎
<39-9,HAYLEY>I'm Hayley. Didn't lie about that.

854
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:36,070
<39-9,HAYLEY>严格来讲  我没有说过谎
<39-9,HAYLEY>Technically, I didn't lie about anything.

855
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,940
<39-9,HAYLEY>我确实隐瞒了事实  但我没说谎
<39-9,HAYLEY>I misrepresented, sure, but I-I didn't lie.

856
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,300
<39-10,CASTLE>但是为什么呢
<39-10,CASTLE>But why?

857
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,540
<39-11,HAYLEY>因为一年半前  是你让我这么做的
<39-11,HAYLEY>Because a year and a half ago, you asked me to.

858
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,640
<39-11,HAYLEY>实际上  是你求我这么做
<39-11,HAYLEY>In fact, you begged.

859
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:45,810
<39-12,CASTLE>我不明白
<39-12,CASTLE>I don't understand.

860
00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:49,360
<39-13,HAYLEY>很久以前我在军情六处做自由职业工作
<39-13,HAYLEY>So ages ago, I did some freelance work for MI-6,

861
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,060
<39-13,HAYLEY>在一次任务中我遇见了一个美国间谍
<39-13,HAYLEY>and I met an American spy on an op.

862
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:55,410
<39-13,HAYLEY>他是个年长的绅士  很英俊聪明绝顶
<39-13,HAYLEY>He was an older gentleman, very handsome, smart as a whip.

863
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:56,580
<39-14,CASTLE>我父亲
<39-14,CASTLE>My father.

864
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:58,030
<39-15,HAYLEY>杰克森·亨特
<39-15,HAYLEY>Jackson Hunt.

865
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,460
<39-15,HAYLEY>一年半前  他找到我
<39-15,HAYLEY>Year and a half ago, he calls me,

866
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:02,100
<39-15,HAYLEY>让我在洛杉矶照看你
<39-15,HAYLEY>asks me to keep an eye out on you here in L.A.

867
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:04,480
<39-15,HAYLEY>说你在干涉一些你不该插手的事情
<39-15,HAYLEY>Said you were sticking your nose where it didn't belong.

868
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,840
<39-16,CASTLE>他说我在做什么
<39-16,CASTLE>What did he say I was doing?

869
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,350
<39-16,CASTLE>我没问  他也没说
<39-16,CASTLE>I didn't ask, he didn't say.

870
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:10,230
<39-17,HAYLEY>但我确实知道你在泰国呆了两周后
<39-17,HAYLEY>But I do know that after your two weeks in Thailand,

871
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:12,180
<39-17,HAYLEY>你在中情局的卧底任务就结束了
<39-17,HAYLEY>your undercover mission for the CIA was over

872
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,290
<39-17,HAYLEY>你本来应该回家的
<39-17,HAYLEY>and you were supposed to go home.

873
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,500
<39-17,HAYLEY>但你却依旧我行我素  去了洛杉矶
<39-17,HAYLEY>But instead you went rogue and you came to L.A.

874
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,680
<39-17,HAYLEY>为了监视你的去向
<39-17,HAYLEY>To keep tabs on you,

875
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:19,110
<39-17,HAYLEY>我从一个朋友马尔科姆那借了个定位跟踪器
<39-17,HAYLEY>I borrowed a GPS tracker from a friend of mine, Malcolm.

876
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:19,760
<39-17,HAYLEY>我把它安到了...
<39-17,HAYLEY>And I placed it --

877
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,510
<39-18,CASTLE>我的手表里  是你
<39-18,CASTLE>In my watch. That was you.

878
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:23,670
<39-19,HAYLEY>对  可你却把它留在了那家韩国餐馆里
<39-19,HAYLEY>Yeah, only you left it in that Korean restaurant.

879
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,900
<39-19,HAYLEY>所以我就失去了你的消息
<39-19,HAYLEY>So I lost track of you.

880
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:28,050
<39-19,HAYLEY>等我找到你时  你已经被人击中了
<39-19,HAYLEY>And by the time I found you, you'd been shot in the side.

881
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:28,960
<39-20,CASTLE>谁开枪射我
<39-20,CASTLE>Who shot me?

882
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,040
<39-20,CASTLE>你不愿意说
<39-20,CASTLE>You wouldn't say.

883
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,930
<39-21,HAYLEY>你确实提到了你在中情局的管理人
<39-21,HAYLEY>You did mention your CIA handler,

884
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:37,700
<39-21,HAYLEY>一个叫詹金斯的人
<39-21,HAYLEY>a guy named Jenkins.

885
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:39,700
<39-21,HAYLEY>你说你要走
<39-21,HAYLEY>You said that you were going to go and ask him

886
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,750
<39-21,HAYLEY>要让他把这里发生在你身上的一切清除
<39-21,HAYLEY>to erase everything that had happened to you here.

887
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:43,320
<39-22,CASTLE>但这听上去不像是我的作风
<39-22,CASTLE>But that doesn't sound like me.

888
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:47,030
<39-22,CASTLE>我天性好奇  我为什么要那样做
<39-22,CASTLE>I'm curious by nature. Why would I do that?

889
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:49,080
<39-23,HAYLEY>我也不知道  但你当时很坚定
<39-23,HAYLEY>I have no clue, but you were adamant.

890
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:51,960
<39-23,HAYLEY>你让我发誓说如果我再见到你
<39-23,HAYLEY>And you made me promise that if I ever met you again,

891
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,350
<39-23,HAYLEY>一定不会提起任何事
<39-23,HAYLEY>I'd never say any of this.

892
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,180
<39-24,CASTLE>但这也不能解释你为什么待在我们身边
<39-24,CASTLE>Well, that doesn't explain why you stuck around,

893
00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:00,140
<39-24,CASTLE>为什么你会同意跟我一起共事
<39-24,CASTLE>why you agreed to come work with me.

894
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:06,380
<39-25,HAYLEY>我很喜欢你里克  我喜欢你的女儿
<39-25,HAYLEY>I'm fond of you, Rick, and I adore your daughter.

895
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:11,790
<39-25,HAYLEY>在过了一辈子只关心自己的生活后
<39-25,HAYLEY>And after a lifetime of caring about nobody but myself,

896
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:15,310
<39-25,HAYLEY>我决定留下来  看着你们两个
<39-25,HAYLEY>I decided to stick around and keep an eye on you two.

897
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:25,310
<39-26,CASTLE>有点像菲利普·迪克的科幻小说
<39-26,CASTLE>It's like a Philip K. Dick novel.

898
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:27,260
<39-26,CASTLE>真希望我能回到过去
<39-26,CASTLE>Wish I could go back in time

899
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:29,790
<39-26,CASTLE>告诉我自己不要清除记忆
<39-26,CASTLE>and tell myself not to erase my memory.

900
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:34,010
<39-27,HAYLEY>或许你可以相信你这么做是有原因的
<39-27,HAYLEY>Or you could trust that you did it with good reason.

901
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:38,090
<39-27,HAYLEY>也许你要对那段消失的时间放手
<39-27,HAYLEY>Maybe just let your lost time go,

902
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:39,470
<39-27,HAYLEY>因为如果你继续调查下去
<39-27,HAYLEY>because if you keep looking,

903
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:42,730
<39-27,HAYLEY>如果你坚持寻找答案
<39-27,HAYLEY>if you keep searching for that answer, well...

904
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:46,480
<39-27,HAYLEY>很难说你会捅出什么大麻烦
<39-27,HAYLEY>there's no telling what kind of hell you'll unleash.

905
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:51,830
<40-1,ALEXIS>爸爸
<40-1,ALEXIS>Dad?

906
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:53,800
<40-1,ALEXIS>海莉跟你说了什么
<40-1,ALEXIS>What did Hayley tell you?

907
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,750
<40-2,CASTLE>真相
<40-2,CASTLE>The truth.

908
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:57,170
<40-3,ALEXIS>为什么海莉要向我们说谎
<40-3,ALEXIS>Why did Hayley lie to us?

909
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:58,820
<40-4,CASTLE>因为是我让她这么做的
<40-4,CASTLE>Because I asked her to.

910
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:01,190
<40-4,CASTLE>情况很复杂
<40-4,CASTLE>It's complicated.

911
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:03,170
<40-5,ALEXIS>你能相信她吗
<40-5,ALEXIS>Can you trust her?

912
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:04,950
<40-6,CASTLE>能  当然能
<40-6,CASTLE>Yes. Absolutely.

913
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:06,430
<40-6,CASTLE>你也可以
<40-6,CASTLE>And you can, too.

914
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:08,030
<40-7,ALEXIS>但你不相信我可以处理好真相吗
<40-7,ALEXIS>But you can't trust me with the truth?

915
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:09,540
<40-8,CASTLE>等等
<40-8,CASTLE>Oh, hang on.

916
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:11,400
<40-8,CASTLE>阿里克西斯  这跟信任无关
<40-8,CASTLE>Alexis, that's not about trust.

917
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,250
<40-8,CASTLE>我是你的父亲
<40-8,CASTLE>I am your father.

918
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:16,520
<40-8,CASTLE>从你降生到这个世界的那天起
<40-8,CASTLE>And from the day you came into this world,

919
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:19,250
<40-8,CASTLE>我就有了保护你的责任
<40-8,CASTLE>it's been my job to protect you.

920
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,550
<40-9,ALEXIS>所以  我们下一步行动是什么
<40-9,ALEXIS>So, what's our next move?

921
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:25,930
<40-10,CASTLE>没有下一步了
<40-10,CASTLE>There is no next move.

922
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,870
<40-10,CASTLE>我们不再惹麻烦了
<40-10,CASTLE>We let sleeping dogs lie.

923
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:30,970
<40-10,CASTLE>那样对每个人来说都更安全
<40-10,CASTLE>It's safer that way, for everyone.

924
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:38,130
<40-11,HAYLEY>真的不好意思打扰你们
<40-11,HAYLEY>I'm really sorry to interrupt,

925
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:40,110
<40-11,HAYLEY>但我找到了一些东西
<40-11,HAYLEY>but I think I found something.

926
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:41,550
<40-12,CASTLE>-关于杀害菲利普的凶手吗  -对
<40-12,CASTLE>- On Phillip's homicide? - Yeah.

927
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:44,280
<40-13,HAYLEY>我在看乔丹·基根的电脑文件
<40-13,HAYLEY>I was going through Jordan Keegan's computer files,

928
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,690
<40-13,HAYLEY>我找到了些有趣的东西
<40-13,HAYLEY>and I found something interesting.

929
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:49,090
<40-14,CASTLE>这是一个剧本
<40-14,CASTLE>It's a screenplay.

930
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:50,870
<40-15,ALEXIS>《双生杀手》
<40-15,ALEXIS>"Gemini Killers."

931
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:54,170
<40-16,HAYLEY>这是个关于连环杀手二人组的恐怖故事
<40-16,HAYLEY>Yeah, it's a dreadful story about a serial-killing duo.

932
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:56,680
<40-16,HAYLEY>不是很确定  但也许能给我们一点启示
<40-16,HAYLEY>Not sure, but it might give us some insight.

934
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,150
<40-17,CASTLE>我见过这个
<40-17,CASTLE>I've seen this before.

935
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,010
<40-18,HAYLEY>这个剧本吗
<40-18,HAYLEY>The script?

936
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:01,330
<40-19,CASTLE>不是  是边上的笔记
<40-19,CASTLE>No, the -- the notes in the margins here --

938
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:02,850
<40-19,CASTLE>这个奇怪的笔迹...
<40-19,CASTLE>this odd handwriting that...

939
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:06,350
<40-19,CASTLE>我知道凶手是谁了
<40-19,CASTLE>I know who the killer is.

940
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,090
<41-1,TREVOR>不  我拿不了  我...
<41-1,TREVOR>No, I cannot hold. I...

941
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,160
<41-3,MENENDEZ>我是特雷夫·纳吉尔
<41-3,MENENDEZ>It's Trevor Nigel.

942
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,830
<41-2,TREVOR>什么...你得把那挪走
<41-2,TREVOR>What -- You're gonna have to move that.

943
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:14,350
<41-3,MENENDEZ>特雷夫·纳吉尔你被逮捕了
<41-3,MENENDEZ>Trevor Nigel, you're under arrest.

944
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:15,850
<41-4,TREVOR>什么
<41-4,TREVOR>Excuse me?

945
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:17,280
<41-5,MENENDEZ>我们找到了杀害菲利普·哈里斯的那把刀
<41-5,MENENDEZ>We found the knife that killed Phillip Harris.

946
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,040
<41-6,HAYLEY>还有一些相当可怕的人体部分
<41-6,HAYLEY>Along with a rather ghastly collection of human body parts.

947
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:22,650
<41-7,TREVOR>我没有承认
<41-7,TREVOR>I admit nothing.

948
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:24,720
<41-8,CASTLE>你的同伙死前也没有
<41-8,CASTLE>Neither did your partner before he was killed.

949
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,820
<41-9,TREVOR>乔丹死了吗
<41-9,TREVOR>Jordan is dead?

950
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:26,980
<41-9,TREVOR>是他出卖了我  对吗
<41-9,TREVOR>He gave me up, didn't he?

951
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:30,370
<41-9,TREVOR>我就知道我不该跟个编剧合伙
<41-9,TREVOR>I knew I should never have partnered with a screenwriter.

952
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:32,280
<41-10,CASTLE>不  特雷夫  是你把自己出卖了
<41-10,CASTLE>No, Trevor. You gave yourself up.

953
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,860
<41-10,CASTLE>当你的片厂在拍《希特热浪》时
<41-10,CASTLE>Back when your studio was doing Heat Wave,

954
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:36,750
<41-10,CASTLE>对你交给我的那个烂剧本我提了建议
<41-10,CASTLE>I gave you notes on that horrible script you commissioned.

955
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:38,480
<41-10,CASTLE>但你却发了回来上面有手写的笔记
<41-10,CASTLE>But you sent it back to me with a handwritten note

956
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,380
<41-10,CASTLE>说我的想法很愚蠢
<41-10,CASTLE>detailing why my ideas were stupid.

957
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:41,860
<41-10,CASTLE>我永远不会忘记坏的评论
<41-10,CASTLE>I never forget a bad review,

958
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,590
<41-10,CASTLE>特别是你的字迹如此特别
<41-10,CASTLE>especially one with such distinctive handwriting.

959
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:44,860
<41-11,HAYLEY>在你那连环杀手搭档的剧本上
<41-11,HAYLEY>It's the same handwriting

960
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:46,820
<41-11,HAYLEY>也出现了同样的笔迹
<41-11,HAYLEY>on your serial killer partner's screenplay.

961
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,440
<41-11,HAYLEY>理查德  你是个不错的作家
<41-11,HAYLEY>Richard, you're a pretty good writer,

962
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,080
<41-12,TREVOR>但你真该读读乔丹的作品
<41-12,TREVOR>but you should really read Jordan's work,

963
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,270
<41-12,TREVOR>因为那实在是让人眼前一亮
<41-12,TREVOR>because it is inspiring.

964
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:55,070
<41-12,TREVOR>我读完他写的《双生杀手》的剧本之后
<41-12,TREVOR>After I read his "Germini Killers" screenplay,

965
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,870
<41-12,TREVOR>我就知道我找到了同路人
<41-12,TREVOR>I knew that I had found a kindred spirit --

966
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,790
<41-12,TREVOR>一个和我有着同样渴望的人
<41-12,TREVOR>someone with the same desires as I had.

967
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:00,820
<41-12,TREVOR>而他的剧本写出了
<41-12,TREVOR>And his script laid out...

968
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,800
<41-12,TREVOR>我们可以用来杀人的完美计划
<41-12,TREVOR>...the perfect plan for us to kill --

969
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,520
<41-12,TREVOR>完全不会引人注意
<41-12,TREVOR>without attracting suspicion.

970
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,000
<41-12,TREVOR>可惜  他总是写不好结局
<41-12,TREVOR>Sadly, he could never nail the end.

971
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:09,810
<41-13,CASTLE>我们猜到了  而你也走到了结局
<41-13,CASTLE>Well, we did, and you've reached it.

972
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,260
<41-14,TREVOR>也许可以由你可以改写他的剧本
<41-14,TREVOR>Maybe you should do the rewrite.

973
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:12,560
<41-14,TREVOR>打给我的助理约个时间
<41-14,TREVOR>Call my assistant to set up a meeting.

974
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:13,710
<41-14,TREVOR>算了吧
<41-14,TREVOR>Know what? I'm good.

975
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:15,040
<41-15,CASTLE>再说  我想你的下一部作品
<41-15,CASTLE>Besides, I think your next picture's

976
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,260
<41-15,CASTLE>应该是监狱情景剧了
<41-15,CASTLE>gonna be a prison drama.

977
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:17,870
<41-16,HAYLEY>-还生我气呢  -是的
<41-16,HAYLEY>- Hey, still pissed at me? - Yep.

978
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:19,210
<41-17,MENENDEZ>拜托
<41-17,MENENDEZ>Oh, come on.

979
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:21,660
<41-18,HAYLEY>我下次来的时候补偿你
<41-18,HAYLEY>I'll make it up to you the next time I'm in town.

980
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:22,830
<41-19,MENENDEZ>最好如此
<41-19,MENENDEZ>You better.

981
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:24,840
<41-20,CASTLE>你俩真甜蜜啊
<41-20,CASTLE>That was really cute.

982
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,750
<41-21,HAYLEY>住口
<41-21,HAYLEY>Oh, stop it.

983
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:27,360
<41-21,HAYLEY>肯德尔
<41-21,HAYLEY>Kendall.

984
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:31,240
<41-22,CASTLE>见到你真高兴  圣佩德罗好玩吗
<41-22,CASTLE>Ha -- nice to see you. How was San Pedro?

985
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,320
<41-22,CASTLE>那边车不多吧
<41-22,CASTLE>Wasn't too much traffic, was there?

986
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,940
<41-22,CASTLE>你开的那条路
<41-22,CASTLE>What freeway did you take?

987
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:36,020
<41-23,KENDALL>手段高明  卡塞尔
<41-23,KENDALL>Well played, Castle.

988
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:41,610
<41-23,KENDALL>你赢了  不公平但合理
<41-23,KENDALL>You beat me, unfair and square.

989
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,020
<41-23,KENDALL>好了
<41-23,KENDALL>All right.

990
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:45,370
<41-24,KENDALL>速战速决吧
<41-24,KENDALL>Let's get this over with.

991
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:52,550
<42-1,ESPOSITO>她人呢  她短信上说有要事
<42-1,ESPOSITO>Where is she? Her text said it was important.

992
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:53,370
<42-2,RYAN>我不知道
<42-2,RYAN>I don't know.

993
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:54,640
<42-3,ESPOSITO>那咱们走吧
<42-3,ESPOSITO>Let's go, then.

994
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,800
<42-6,ESPOSITO>你这是干吗
<42-6,ESPOSITO>Hey! What'd you do that for?

995
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,280
<42-7,LANIE>我问了泰勒尿床的事
<42-7,LANIE>I confronted Tyler about his bed-wetting.

996
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:10,680
<42-8,RYAN>我们很抱歉  可以了吗
<42-8,RYAN>Hey, hey, hey! Look, we're sorry, okay?

997
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:11,760
<42-9,LANIE>一点也不可以
<42-9,LANIE>It's far from okay.

998
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,730
<42-9,LANIE>我们分手了
<42-9,LANIE>We broke up.

999
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:15,590
<42-10,ESPOSITO>我们去找他谈谈  帮你们俩和好
<42-10,ESPOSITO>Well, we'll talk to him. We'll work it out.

1000
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:17,370
<42-11,RYAN>不用  是我提出的分手
<42-11,RYAN>No, I broke up with him.

1001
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:19,280
<42-12,LANIE>他否认自己尿床
<42-12,LANIE>After he denied being a bed wetter,

1002
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,980
<42-12,LANIE>但他承认自己有个癖好
<42-12,LANIE>he admitted to having a fetish for...

1003
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:24,010
<42-12,LANIE>反正不是什么好事
<42-12,LANIE>Ooh, let's just say it was nasty.

1004
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,200
<42-13,RYAN>怎么叫做不是好事
<42-13,RYAN>What do you mean, "nasty"?

1005
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:27,790
<42-14,ESPOSITO>这家伙到底有什么诡异的癖好
<42-14,ESPOSITO>Yeah, what kind of nasty things was this dude into?

1006
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,170
<42-15,LANIE>滚出我的停尸房
<42-15,LANIE>Get out of my morgue!

1007
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:33,540
<42-15,LANIE>你们俩混球
<42-15,LANIE>Losers!

1008
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:35,870
<43-1,MASON WOOD>比赛结束了
<43-1,MASON WOOD>The competition has ended.

00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,370
<43-7,CASTLE>但是  你们应该认真考虑
<43-7,CASTLE>But, sir, you should seriously consider Kendall

1025
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:17,040
<43-7,CASTLE>让肯德尔加入
<43-7,CASTLE>for membership.

<43-7,CASTLE>She is one hell of a detective

1027
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:21,230
<43-7,CASTLE>而且非常精明
<43-7,CASTLE>and sneaky in all the right ways.

1028

00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:55,110
<44-2,CASTLE>我做不到
<44-2,CASTLE>I can't do it.

00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:00,160
<44-4,CASTLE>海莉  我需要知道到底发生了什么
<44-4,CASTLE>Hayley, I need to know what happened to me.

1039
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,320
<44-5,HAYLEY>好吧  还有最后一件事
<44-5,HAYLEY>Okay, there's one last thing.

1040
00:39:03,330 --> 00:39:05,720
<44-5,HAYLEY>就在你去消除记忆之前
<44-5,HAYLEY>Just before you left to get your memories erased,

1041
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,940
<44-5,HAYLEY>你带着最后一个请求来找我
<44-5,HAYLEY>you came to me with one final request.

1042
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:09,280
<44-6,CASTLE>什么请求
<44-6,CASTLE>Like what kind of request?

1043
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,960
<44-7,HAYLEY>如果你要求知道真相的话
<44-7,HAYLEY>That if you demanded to know the truth,

1044
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:13,560
<44-7,HAYLEY>我就给你看这个
<44-7,HAYLEY>I show you this.

1046
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,090
<44-8,CASTLE>这是什么
<44-8,CASTLE>What is this?

1047
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:20,030
<44-9,HAYLEY>黑网上一个秘密网址
<44-9,HAYLEY>It's a, uh, secret website on the dark web.

1048
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:20,910
<44-10,CASTLE>里面有什么
<44-10,CASTLE>What's on it?

1049
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:21,660
<44-11,HAYLEY>不知道
<44-11,HAYLEY>Not a clue.

1050
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,270
<44-11,HAYLEY>你设了一个只有你自己知道的密码
<44-11,HAYLEY>You installed a password that only you would know.

1051
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:24,840
<44-11,HAYLEY>称之为"布莱尔的密码"
<44-11,HAYLEY>Called it "Blair's combination."

1052
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:28,430
<44-12,CASTLE>那是我十七岁时写的一个短故事
<44-12,CASTLE>From a short story I wrote when I was 17.

1053
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:29,970
<44-12,CASTLE>从来没有发表过
<44-12,CASTLE>Never saw the light of day.

1054
00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:31,580
<44-12,CASTLE>密码是什么
<44-12,CASTLE>What was that combination?

1055
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:36,010
<44-12,CASTLE>4左
<44-12,CASTLE>4 left...

1056
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:38,020
<44-12,CASTLE>17右
<44-12,CASTLE>17 right...

1057
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:39,980
<44-13,HAYLEY>21左
<44-13,HAYLEY>21 left.

1059
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:44,510
<44-13,HAYLEY>我出去了
<44-13,HAYLEY>I'll step out.

1060
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:45,930
<44-13,HAYLEY>不  不  你
<44-13,HAYLEY>No, no. You've, um...

1061
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:47,940
<44-14,CASTLE>你有权一起看
<44-14,CASTLE>You've earned the right to see this.

1062
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,170
<44-15,CASTLE>伙计  是我
<44-15,CASTLE>Hey, there, buddy. It's me.

1063
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:54,950
<44-15,CASTLE>应该说  是你
<44-15,CASTLE>And by "me," I mean you.

1064
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:57,660
<44-15,CASTLE>如果你看到这个视频的话  说明你是个蠢货
<44-15,CASTLE>And if you are seeing this, then you are an idiot,

1065
00:39:58,170 --> 00:39:59,810
<44-15,CASTLE>因为你试图搞清楚
<44-15,CASTLE>because you are trying to figure out

1066
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:01,800
<44-15,CASTLE>在洛杉矶发生了什么
<44-15,CASTLE>what happened to you in Los Angeles.

1067
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,490
<44-15,CASTLE>你查出的关于布莱肯
<44-15,CASTLE>What you discovered about

1068
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:05,750
<44-15,CASTLE>和洛克塞特合作的事
<44-15,CASTLE>Bracken's partnership with LokSat

1069
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:07,280
<44-15,CASTLE>太过危险了
<44-15,CASTLE>is too dangerous to pursue.

1070
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,350
<44-16,CASTLE>洛克塞特
<44-16,CASTLE>LokSat?

1071
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,580
<44-16,CASTLE>我知道洛克塞特的事
<44-16,CASTLE>I knew about LokSat?

1072
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:12,390
<44-17,CASTLE>我差点没命就是很好的例子
<44-17,CASTLE>I am barely living proof.

1073
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:14,590
<44-17,CASTLE>我中枪是因为我试图查出
<44-17,CASTLE>I was shot trying to figure out

1074
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:16,680
<44-17,CASTLE>洛克塞特的航班今晚在哪降落
<44-17,CASTLE>where LokSat's plane was landing tonight.

1075
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,800
<44-17,CASTLE>我差一点就被发现而命丧虎口
<44-17,CASTLE>I barely escaped without being identified.

1076
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:23,490
<44-17,CASTLE>我清除咱们的记忆是有原因的
<44-17,CASTLE>I am erasing our mind for a reason --

1077
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:26,490
<44-17,CASTLE>为了保护凯特
<44-17,CASTLE>to protect Kate.

1078
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,090
<44-17,CASTLE>因为如果她发现了
<44-17,CASTLE>'Cause if she found out,

1079
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:31,850
<44-17,CASTLE>她就会没命
<44-17,CASTLE>then she will die.

1080
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:37,330
<44-17,CASTLE>所以为了她好  不要告诉她
<44-17,CASTLE>So do not tell her what you discovered in Los Angeles,

1081
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:38,600
<44-17,CASTLE>你在洛杉矶的发现
<44-17,CASTLE>for her sake.

1082
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,560
<44-18,CASTLE>你知道这意味着什么吗
<44-18,CASTLE>Do you know what this means?

1083
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,750
<44-19,HAYLEY>是的  你追踪到了洛克塞特
<44-19,HAYLEY>Yes. You tracked LokSat.

1084
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:44,320
<44-19,HAYLEY>如果我们可以查到机场记录
<44-19,HAYLEY>If we can cross-reference airports

1085
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:47,220
<44-19,HAYLEY>确定你中枪当晚都有哪些航班降落的话
<44-19,HAYLEY>and identify what airplane landed the night you were shot,

1086
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:49,330
<44-19,HAYLEY>我们就很有机会
<44-19,HAYLEY>then we have a real chance

1087
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:51,160
<44-19,HAYLEY>查出洛克塞特究竟是谁了
<44-19,HAYLEY>of finding out who LokSat really is.

1088
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,440
<44-19,HAYLEY>不  不
<44-19,HAYLEY>No, no.

1089
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:56,210
<44-20,CASTLE>这意味着发生的一切都是我的错
<44-20,CASTLE>It means what happened was my fault.

1090
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:01,980
<44-20,CASTLE>贝克特之前同事的遇害
<44-20,CASTLE>The murders of Beckett's former AG team --

1091
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:05,180
<44-20,CASTLE>为了保护贝克特不受洛克塞特的伤害
<44-20,CASTLE>in trying to protect Beckett from LokSat,

1092
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:08,140
<44-20,CASTLE>我无意中给他们都判了死刑
<44-20,CASTLE>I inadvertently sentenced them all to death.
