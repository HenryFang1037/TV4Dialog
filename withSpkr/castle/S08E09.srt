43
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,220
<2-7,BECKETT>谁能想到
<2-7,BECKETT>Who would have thought

44
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,420
<2-7,BECKETT>秘密约会能这么有成效
<2-7,BECKETT>that secret dating would be so productive?

45
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:41,860
<2-8,CASTLE>是啊  我们公开的争吵
<2-8,CASTLE>I know. Our public fights have made

46
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,960
<2-8,CASTLE>让我们私下的会面更加
<2-8,CASTLE>our private time so much more...

00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,010
<2-9,BECKETT>激烈了

00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:49,070
<2-12,CASTLE>警监还有空再议一题吗
<2-12,CASTLE>I don't suppose the captain has time for one more agenda?

50
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:50,490
<2-13,BECKETT>抱歉  我也想
<2-13,BECKETT>Oh, I'm sorry. I wish I could.

<2-13,BECKETT>但我得去总部跟盖茨警监会面
<2-13,BECKETT>But I have to make this meeting with Captain Gates at 1pp.

52
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,560
<2-14,CASTLE>那盖茨其实是指代维克拉姆
<2-14,CASTLE>And is "Gates" code for "Vikram"

53
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,410
<2-14,CASTLE>而总部其实是指你们的脱衣舞吧藏身处吗
<2-14,CASTLE>and "1pp" your secret strip-club hideout?

54
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,850
<2-15,BECKETT>不  跟盖茨的会面绝对是真的
<2-15,BECKETT>No. The meeting with Gates is very real.

<2-15,BECKETT>I will loop you in on everything LokSat.

58
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:15,120
<2-16,CASTLE>我理解这是一个秘密行动
<2-16,CASTLE>I-I mean, I get that the whole thing is a covert op.

59
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,900
<2-16,CASTLE>我只是想说  我可以作为你扳倒洛克塞特的
<2-16,CASTLE>I'm just saying... I could be your secret weapon

60
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,400
<2-16,CASTLE>秘密武器
<2-16,CASTLE>in taking LokSat down.

<2-17,BECKETT>Meanwhile, - I will be sneaking in and out

64
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:30,910
<2-17,BECKETT>溜进溜出
<2-17,BECKETT>of the building next door to get here.

65
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:32,200
<2-18,CASTLE>那我呢

76
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:06,870
<3-4,MARTHA>我们该考虑的是可怜的好姑娘罗宾

<3-6,MARTHA>She... she sat through an entire rehearsal,

79
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,740
<3-6,MARTHA>还一直等着
<3-6,MARTHA>and then she waited around

80
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,760
<3-6,MARTHA>跟我说谢谢
<3-6,MARTHA>so she could come up and thank me.

85
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,920
<3-6,MARTHA>查清真凶
<3-6,MARTHA>and find out who did this.

<3-7,CASTLE>当然
<3-7,CASTLE>Yeah, of course. Of course.

00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:35,410
<3-12,LANIE PARISH>玛莎还好吗
<3-12,LANIE PARISH>How's Martha?

91
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:36,860
<3-13,CASTLE>吓得不轻

92
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,070
<3-13,CASTLE>怎么回事
<3-13,CASTLE>What happened?

93
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,510
<3-14,KEVIN RYAN>被害人罗宾·金  20岁
<3-14,KEVIN RYAN>Victim is Robyn King, 20 years old.

<3-14,KEVIN RYAN>Works as the theater's night janitor.

95
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:46,640
<3-15,LANIE>从尸斑和尸温判断  死亡时间
<3-15,LANIE>Based on lividity and body temp, I estimate the time of death

96
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,970
<3-15,LANIE>约为昨晚9点到11点之间
<3-15,LANIE>is last night between 9:00 and 11:00.

97
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:51,570
<3-15,LANIE>死因  钝器击伤致死
<3-15,LANIE>Cause of death... blunt-force trauma.

98
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:55,860
<3-16,RYAN>凶手击中了罗宾的头  然后把她塞进雪箱
<3-16,RYAN>Killer hit Robyn in the head, stuffed her in the snow box,

99
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,220
<3-16,RYAN>升到了房梁上
<3-16,RYAN>and lifted her up to the rafter.

100
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,320
<3-17,LANIE>她在那儿流血致死
<3-17,LANIE>Where she bled out.

101
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:00,790
<3-18,JAVIER ESPOSITO>这是克里斯·杰克逊
<3-18,JAVIER ESPOSITO>This is Chris Jackson.

102
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,090
<3-18,JAVIER ESPOSITO>他是剧院制作经理
<3-18,JAVIER ESPOSITO>He's the theater's production manager.

103
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:05,280
<3-19,CASTLE>理查德·卡塞尔  是你雇佣了罗宾
<3-19,CASTLE>Richard Castle. So, you're the one who hired Robyn?

104
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,870
<3-20,CHRIS JACKSON>是的  我起初还有点紧张
<3-20,CHRIS JACKSON>Yes. And I was a little nervous at first.

105
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:09,570
<3-20,CHRIS JACKSON>罗宾是释放犯
<3-20,CHRIS JACKSON>Robyn was an ex-con,

106
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:12,420
<3-20,CHRIS JACKSON>但她的假释官敦促我给她份工作
<3-20,CHRIS JACKSON>but her parole officer pressed me to give her a job...

107
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,810
<3-20,CHRIS JACKSON>还保证说她非常值得信任
<3-20,CHRIS JACKSON>Promised that she was completely trustworthy.

108
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:17,760
<3-20,CHRIS JACKSON>昨晚之前从未出过问题
<3-20,CHRIS JACKSON>And until last night, there hadn't been a single problem.

109
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,940
<3-21,ESPOSITO>昨晚怎么了
<3-21,ESPOSITO>What happened last night?

110
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:21,910
<3-22,JACKSON>有个女人来找罗宾
<3-22,JACKSON>A woman showed up looking for Robyn,

111
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,550
<3-22,JACKSON>她非常愤怒
<3-22,JACKSON>and she was pissed.

112
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:24,530
<3-23,CASTLE>罗宾认识她吗
<3-23,CASTLE>And Robyn knew her?

113
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,350
<3-24,JACKSON>是的  她喊她"妈妈"
<3-24,JACKSON>Oh, yeah. She called her "mama."

114
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,320
<3-24,JACKSON>但她们显然不是幸福的一家人
<3-24,JACKSON>But they clearly weren't a happy family.

115
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:32,300
<3-24,JACKSON>我离开时还听到罗宾威胁说
<3-24,JACKSON>As I was leaving, I heard Robyn threaten to call the cops

116
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:34,300
<3-24,JACKSON>如果她妈再靠近她  她就叫警察
<3-24,JACKSON>if her mom ever came near her again.

117
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:36,750
<3-24,JACKSON>我真不该就那么走掉
<3-24,JACKSON>I shouldn't have left them alone.

118
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:41,270
<3-24,JACKSON>如果我当时没走  罗宾或许不会死
<3-24,JACKSON>Robyn might still be alive if I had just...stayed behind.

119
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,440
<4-1,RYAN>意外情况
<4-1,RYAN>So, here's a surprise.

120
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:49,180
<4-1,RYAN>根据罗宾的记录显示  她妈妈在她五岁时就死了
<4-1,RYAN>Robyn's records show that her mother died when she was 5.

121
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:51,230
<4-2,CASTLE>-那这个"妈妈"是谁  -问得好
<4-2,CASTLE>- Then who's "mama"? - Exactly.

122
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,270
<4-3,RYAN>我还发现了一个谜团
<4-3,RYAN>And here's another mystery that I found...

123
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,820
<4-3,RYAN>据罗宾的地铁卡显示
<4-3,RYAN>according to Robyn's MetroCard,

124
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:57,610
<4-3,RYAN>她出狱之后每周两晚都会
<4-3,RYAN>she's been taking subway trips up to Spanish Harlem

125
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:00,290
<4-3,RYAN>坐地铁去西班牙哈莱姆区
<4-3,RYAN>two nights a week ever since she was released from prison.

126
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:02,340
<4-3,RYAN>每次都是11:30左右离开
<4-3,RYAN>Each time, she leaves around 11:30 p.m.,

127
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:05,240
<4-3,RYAN>待近两小时才回家
<4-3,RYAN>stays for almost two hours before going home.

128
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,370
<4-4,CASTLE>能从财务方面看出她是去做什么了吗
<4-4,CASTLE>Any indication in her financials what she's doing up there?

129
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,400
<4-5,RYAN>还没查到什么
<4-5,RYAN>No, nothing yet.

130
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:11,770
<4-6,CASTLE>-我得接一下  -好
<4-6,CASTLE>- I got to take that. - Okay.

131
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,270
<4-8,CASTLE>我听说玛莎的事了
<4-8,CASTLE>So, I heard about Martha.

132
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,220
<4-9,BECKETT>你怎么没打断会议  叫我出来啊
<4-9,BECKETT>Why didn't you pull me out of the meeting?

133
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,360
<4-10,CASTLE>是这样  我想过的
<4-10,CASTLE>You know what? I thought about it.

134
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,080
<4-10,CASTLE>但因为我们的地下关系什么的
<4-10,CASTLE>But this whole new... secret relationship...

135
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,770
<4-10,CASTLE>我不知道有什么规矩
<4-10,CASTLE>I wasn't quite sure what the rules were.

136
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:22,860
<4-11,BECKETT>她没事吧
<4-11,BECKETT>Well, i-is she okay?

137
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,170
<4-12,CASTLE>身体上是没事
<4-12,CASTLE>Physically, yes. She's fine.

138
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:26,070
<4-12,CASTLE>但情绪不太好
<4-12,CASTLE>Emotionally, not so much.

139
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:28,750
<4-12,CASTLE>她要我答应她一定亲自揪出杀了罗宾的凶手
<4-12,CASTLE>She made me promise to help track down Robyn's killer.

140
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,710
<4-13,BECKETT>当然  但你得知道我在明面上
<4-13,BECKETT>Of course, - but you know that publicly,

141
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:31,910
<4-13,BECKETT>得做出反对
<4-13,BECKETT>I can't agree to that.

142
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:32,850
<4-14,CASTLE>什么意思
<4-14,CASTLE>What do you mean?

143
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:34,100
<4-15,BECKETT>意思是  我爱你
<4-15,BECKETT>Well, it means that I love you,

144
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:36,740
<4-15,BECKETT>但现在  我得吼你了
<4-15,BECKETT>but right now, - I'm gonna have to yell at you.

145
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:40,570
<4-15,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<4-15,BECKETT>Castle!

146
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:42,870
<4-16,BECKETT>我们说过的  你不能来这儿
<4-16,BECKETT>We talked about this! You can't be here!

147
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:45,400
<4-17,CASTLE>抱歉了  但我有充分的理由
<4-17,CASTLE>Well, excuse me for living, but I've got a damn good reason.

148
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,300
<4-18,BECKETT>我不管
<4-18,BECKETT>I don't care what your reason is.

149
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,600
<4-18,BECKETT>你不能就这么随心所欲地
<4-18,BECKETT>You can't just waltz in and out of my precinct

150
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,710
<4-18,BECKETT>进出我的分局
<4-18,BECKETT>whenever you want.

151
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,970
<4-19,CASTLE>我妈妈可是吓坏了  警监
<4-19,CASTLE>Uh, my mother was traumatized, captain.

152
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:54,850
<4-19,CASTLE>不管你喜不喜欢  我都得参与这件案子
<4-19,CASTLE>I'm involved in this case, whether you like it or not.

153
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:57,640
<4-20,BECKETT>好吧  但我会盯紧你的
<4-20,BECKETT>Fine. But you're on a short leash.

154
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:00,740
<4-21,CASTLE>有多紧我说了算
<4-21,CASTLE>Oh, I'll decide how short my leash is.

155
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:05,000
<4-22,ESPOSITO>刚跟罗宾的假释官通过电话
<4-22,ESPOSITO>Just got off the phone with Robyn's parole officer.

156
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:06,780
<4-22,ESPOSITO>看我发现了什么  罗宾的妈妈
<4-22,ESPOSITO>Look who I found... Robyn's mama.

157
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,670
<4-22,ESPOSITO>"妈妈"奥利维亚·图森特
<4-22,ESPOSITO>Olivia "Mama" Toussaint.

158
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:11,310
<4-22,ESPOSITO>是个卖派对毒品给富二代的中层毒贩
<4-22,ESPOSITO>She's a mid-level dealer who sells party drugs to rich kids.

159
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,550
<4-22,ESPOSITO>罗宾两年前被抓时就是她手下的一员
<4-22,ESPOSITO>Robyn was part of her crew two years ago when she got busted.

160
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:15,020
<4-23,BECKETT>罗宾被捕是因为什么
<4-23,BECKETT>What was Robyn arrested for?

161
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:17,580
<4-24,RYAN>盗车重罪  疏忽致险
<4-24,RYAN>Uh, grand theft auto, reckless endangerment,

162
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,830
<4-24,RYAN>破坏私产
<4-24,RYAN>destruction of private property.

163
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,390
<4-25,ESPOSITO>罗宾去一家长岛的乡村俱乐部
<4-25,ESPOSITO>Robyn made a delivery to a country club

164
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:22,330
<4-25,ESPOSITO>送货  但留下参加派对来着
<4-25,ESPOSITO>On long island, decided to stay for the party.

165
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,780
<4-25,ESPOSITO>她喝醉后  偷了辆车  撞进了房子里
<4-25,ESPOSITO>She got wasted, stole a car, drove into a house...

166
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,180
<4-25,ESPOSITO>损失高达50万美元
<4-25,ESPOSITO>Half a million dollars' worth of damage.

167
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,080
<4-26,RYAN>去阿尔比恩监狱蹲了两年
<4-26,RYAN>Got her two years in Albion correctional, too.

168
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:30,670
<4-27,CASTLE>那么罗宾现在获得假释  妈妈就去剧院
<4-27,CASTLE>So, with Robyn out on parole, mama must have gone

169
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:32,390
<4-27,CASTLE>想再把她招回麾下
<4-27,CASTLE>to the theater to bring her back into the fold.

170
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:35,120
<4-28,BECKETT>但罗宾不肯  还威胁要把妈妈供出去
<4-28,BECKETT>But Robyn refused and threatened to rat mama out.

171
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,030
<4-29,CASTLE>于是妈妈就永远封了罗宾的口
<4-29,CASTLE>So mama silenced Robyn for good.

172
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,010
<4-30,BECKETT>好吧  把她找来
<4-30,BECKETT>All right, boys, bring her in.

173
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:39,850
<4-30,BECKETT>好
<4-30,BECKETT>All right.

174
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:46,360
<5-1,CASTLE>告诉我  "妈妈"是个讽刺吗
<5-1,CASTLE>Tell me... is the "Mama" meant to be ironic?

175
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:49,940
<5-1,CASTLE>让未成年孩子替你贩毒可不像个妈妈
<5-1,CASTLE>Not very motherly having underage kids run drugs for you.

176
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,840
<5-1,CASTLE>我不知道你在说什么
<5-1,CASTLE>I don't know what you're talking about.

177
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:53,510
<5-2,ESPOSITO>那罗宾·金呢
<5-2,ESPOSITO>What about the name Robyn King?

178
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,150
<5-2,ESPOSITO>记起来了吗
<5-2,ESPOSITO>Does that ring a bell?

179
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:57,080
<5-3,MAMA>当然  怎么了
<5-3,MAMA>Sure. What of it?

180
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,820
<5-4,ESPOSITO>她为你蹲了两年监狱
<5-4,ESPOSITO>She did two years in prison for you.

181
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,260
<5-5,CASTLE>你大概觉得你每月往她监狱
<5-5,CASTLE>You probably thought the $40 a month you put

182
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,760
<5-5,CASTLE>小卖部存的40美元足以收买她的忠诚
<5-5,CASTLE>in her prison commissary account would keep her loyal.

183
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:05,320
<5-6,ESPOSITO>但我猜事与愿违
<5-6,ESPOSITO>But I'm thinking it didn't.

184
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:06,840
<5-6,ESPOSITO>所以你才去了趟剧院
<5-6,ESPOSITO>That's why you stopped by the theater

185
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,110
<5-6,ESPOSITO>想摆老妈的谱  让她愧疚
<5-6,ESPOSITO>to lay down a little - old-fashioned motherly guilt.

186
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:12,210
<5-7,CASTLE>或者是想强迫她回到你手下
<5-7,CASTLE>Or was it to strong-arm her back onto your crew?

187
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:15,390
<5-8,MAMA>我是去看她的  确保她一切都好
<5-8,MAMA>I went there to check on her, make sure she was okay.

188
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:17,820
<5-9,ESPOSITO>我们有目击证人说你到的时候怒气冲冲
<5-9,ESPOSITO>We got a witness that says you were angry when you showed up.

189
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,270
<5-10,MAMA>没办法  她伤了我的感情
<5-10,MAMA>What can I say? She hurt my feelings.

190
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,360
<5-11,CASTLE>是啊  孩子啊
<5-11,CASTLE>Yeah. Kids.

191
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:22,840
<5-11,CASTLE>不打电话  不写信
<5-11,CASTLE>They don't call, they don't write.

192
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,000
<5-12,MAMA>可不是
<5-12,MAMA>Tell me about it.

193
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:25,990
<5-12,MAMA>按理说  他们该知道感激
<5-12,MAMA>You think they'd show a little gratitude

194
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:28,140
<5-12,MAMA>而不是为了新家庭而甩掉你
<5-12,MAMA>instead of dumping you for a new family.

195
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,310
<5-13,ESPOSITO>所以你就杀了她吗
<5-13,ESPOSITO>Is that why you killed her?

196
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,200
<5-13,ESPOSITO>因为她开始跟别人混了
<5-13,ESPOSITO>'cause she started running with that other crew?

197
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,690
<5-14,MAMA>我没杀她  警探
<5-14,MAMA>I didn't kill her, detective.

198
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:36,060
<5-14,MAMA>我去了那儿  把想说的说了  我就走了
<5-14,MAMA>I went there, I said my piece, I left.

199
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,900
<5-14,MAMA>我能证明
<5-14,MAMA>And I can prove it.

200
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,530
<5-15,CASTLE>这个新家庭
<5-15,CASTLE>This new family...

201
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:41,770
<5-15,CASTLE>不会是在西班牙哈莱姆吧
<5-15,CASTLE>they wouldn't happen to live in Spanish Harlem, would they?

202
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:42,990
<5-16,MAMA>我怎么知道
<5-16,MAMA>Hell if I know.

203
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:45,170
<5-16,MAMA>罗宾说是在监狱里搭上了他们
<5-16,MAMA>Robyn said she hooked up with them in prison

204
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:47,330
<5-16,MAMA>而且他们有重大计划要执行
<5-16,MAMA>and that they had a big thing coming up.

205
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,070
<6-2,BECKETT>审妈妈审得如何
<6-2,BECKETT>How'd it go with mama?

206
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:58,160
<6-3,CASTLE>她的不在场证明核实了
<6-3,CASTLE>Oh, her, uh, alibi checks out.

207
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,070
<6-3,CASTLE>她8:15就已经上了出租
<6-3,CASTLE>She was in a cab by 8:15.

208
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:03,690
<6-3,CASTLE>看来罗宾在跟新的团伙混了
<6-3,CASTLE>And it looks as though Robyn was working with a new crew.

209
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,060
<6-4,BECKETT>我早先真的很开心
<6-4,BECKETT>I had a really great time earlier.

210
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,270
<6-5,CASTLE>我也是
<6-5,CASTLE>Me too.

211
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,240
<6-6,BECKETT>我现在想吻你是不是很不对
<6-6,BECKETT>Is it wrong that I want to kiss you right now?

212
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,620
<6-7,CASTLE>不对到对
<6-7,CASTLE>So wrong, it's right.

213
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,200
<6-9,CASTLE>-真抱歉  -为什么
<6-9,CASTLE>- I'm sorry. - For what?

214
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:19,430
<6-10,BECKETT>你个混蛋
<6-10,BECKETT>You're a jerk!

215
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,430
<6-11,ESPOSITO>哥们  没事吧
<6-11,ESPOSITO>H-hey, bro, you okay?

216
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:25,230
<6-11,ESPOSITO>嗯
<6-11,ESPOSITO>Yeah.

217
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,790
<6-12,CASTLE>不  她好使劲啊
<6-12,CASTLE>No. Ow! Man, she hits hard.

218
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:30,280
<6-13,RYAN>卡塞尔  显然你在这儿
<6-13,RYAN>Look, Castle, I-it's clearly not okay,

219
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,210
<6-13,RYAN>是个问题
<6-13,RYAN>you being here.

220
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,220
<6-14,ESPOSITO>嗯  你还是回家吧
<6-14,ESPOSITO>Yeah, you better go home.

221
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,920
<6-14,ESPOSITO>我们有发现会打给你
<6-14,ESPOSITO>We'll call you if we find anything.

222
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:04,860
<6-14,ESPOSITO>你是对的
<6-14,ESPOSITO>You're right.

223
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,700
<7-1,MARTHA>泡泡  很舒缓
<7-1,MARTHA>The bubbles... very soothing.

224
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,770
<7-2,CASTLE>妈妈  你在干什么
<7-2,CASTLE>Mother. What are you doing here?

225
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:12,440
<7-2,CASTLE>你该在家休息的
<7-2,CASTLE>You should be at home, resting.

226
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,660
<7-3,MARTHA>得了  我怎么休得了
<7-3,MARTHA>Please. How can I possibly rest?

227
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,890
<7-3,MARTHA>还要抓杀人犯呢
<7-3,MARTHA>There's a murderer to catch.

228
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:18,270
<7-4,CASTLE>听我说  我得提醒你  我们发现证据
<7-4,CASTLE>Listen, I-I have to warn you... we found evidence

229
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:20,640
<7-4,CASTLE>表明罗宾可能回归了犯罪生活
<7-4,CASTLE>that Robyn may have returned to a life of crime.

230
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,790
<7-5,MARTHA>不会  那姑娘是个好人
<7-5,MARTHA>Nonsense. That girl has a good heart.

231
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,640
<7-5,MARTHA>我知道她在努力改变自己的生活
<7-5,MARTHA>I know she was trying to turn her life around.

232
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,150
<7-5,MARTHA>我们开工吧  我能帮什么忙
<7-5,MARTHA>So let's get to work. What can I do to help?

233
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,440
<7-5,MARTHA>好吧
<7-5,MARTHA>All right.

234
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,480
<7-6,CASTLE>我们知道罗宾每周两次去西班牙哈莱姆
<7-6,CASTLE>We know that Robyn was meeting with her new crew

235
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,260
<7-6,CASTLE>见她的新团伙
<7-6,CASTLE>twice a week in Spanish Harlem.

236
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,440
<7-6,CASTLE>我觉得她手机上的这些符号
<7-6,CASTLE>And I think these symbols on her phone

237
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,130
<7-6,CASTLE>跟下次会议有关系
<7-6,CASTLE>have something to do with her next meeting.

238
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:38,820
<7-7,ALEXIS>那么问题在哪
<7-7,ALEXIS>So, what's the problem?

239
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:41,180
<7-8,CASTLE>我不会符号表情语
<7-8,CASTLE>I don't speak emoji.

240
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,180
<7-8,CASTLE>第一个符号
<7-8,CASTLE>I think that first symbol there...

241
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:47,610
<7-8,CASTLE>那个按钮  显然是个钟
<7-8,CASTLE>the buttony thing... is a clock, obviously.

242
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,450
<7-9,MARTHA>而且指针在12点方向
<7-9,MARTHA>Uh-huh, and the hands are on 12,

243
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:51,100
<7-9,MARTHA>那么罗宾的团伙是中午见面
<7-9,MARTHA>So Robyn's crew is meeting at noon.

244
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,040
<7-10,CASTLE>不对  是午夜
<7-10,CASTLE>Not noon... midnight.

245
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:55,750
<7-10,CASTLE>这样我们还有一小时
<7-10,CASTLE>So that gives us less than an hour

246
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,100
<7-10,CASTLE>研究出含义  赶去市区
<7-10,CASTLE>to figure this out and get uptown.

247
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,860
<7-11,ALEXIS>好吧  一只羊  一个耳朵
<7-11,ALEXIS>Okay, so we have - a sheep, an ear,

248
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,010
<7-11,ALEXIS>一个D  一只公牛
<7-11,ALEXIS>a "D," a bull,

249
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:04,370
<7-11,ALEXIS>一个包  沙滩球  和鱼竿上的鱼
<7-11,ALEXIS>a bag, a beach ball, and a fish on a pole.

250
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,170
<7-12,MARTHA>表情符号可以代表其他东西
<7-12,MARTHA>Emojis are symbolic for other things.

251
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:09,280
<7-13,CASTLE>当然  问题是它代表的是什么
<7-13,CASTLE>Clearly, but symbolic for what other things?

252
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:11,320
<7-14,ALEXIS>你会去哪儿钓鱼
<7-14,ALEXIS>Well, where would you go fishing?

253
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,160
<7-15,CASTLE>水边
<7-15,CASTLE>Water.

254
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,000
<7-15,CASTLE>河边
<7-15,CASTLE>By the river.

255
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,560
<7-16,CASTLE>可这和羊有什么关系
<7-16,CASTLE>What does that have to do with sheep?

256
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:19,060
<7-17,ALEXIS>表情符号大多是合成词
<7-17,ALEXIS>Well, emojis are often compound words,

257
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:22,340
<7-17,ALEXIS>所以"羊"加上"耳朵"
<7-17,ALEXIS>So "sheep" plus "ear"...

258
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,840
<7-17,ALEXIS>加上字母D可以是...
<7-17,ALEXIS>plus "D" could mean...

259
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,200
<7-18,CASTLE>羊耳朵...牧羊人
<7-18,CASTLE>Sheep eared. Shepherd.

260
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,280
<7-20,ALEXIS>-牧羊人  -没错
<7-20,ALEXIS>- Shepherd. - Exactly.

262
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,590
<7-21,MARTHA>-那公牛呢  -固执吗
<7-21,MARTHA>- And the bull? - Stubborn?

263
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,900
<7-23,CASTLE>华尔街吗  但那不在西班牙哈莱姆区
<7-23,CASTLE>Wall street? That's not in Spanish harlem.

264
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,480
<7-24,MARTHA>公牛是金牛座的符号
<7-24,MARTHA>Bull is the astrological sign for taurus.

265
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,120
<7-25,CASTLE>确实  这有帮助吗
<7-25,CASTLE>It is. Does that help us?

266
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,020
<7-26,ALEXIS>我们先做个标记
<7-26,ALEXIS>We'll put a pin in that.

267
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,110
<7-26,ALEXIS>接下去是包和球
<7-26,ALEXIS>Next are the bag and the ball.

268
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,460
<7-27,MARTHA>那可不是普通的包
<7-27,MARTHA>And not just any bag.

269
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,450
<7-27,MARTHA>那是个购物袋
<7-27,MARTHA>That is a shopping bag.

270
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:46,410
<7-28,CASTLE>你当然是最熟悉购物袋的
<7-28,CASTLE>An item with which you are intimately familiar.

271
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:47,650
<7-29,ALEXIS>连起来是  购物球
<7-29,ALEXIS>So, shopping ball?

272
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:50,640
<7-29,ALEXIS>不  广场  购物广场
<7-29,ALEXIS>No - -  mall. Shopping mall.

273
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,230
<7-30,CASTLE>等等
<7-30,CASTLE>Wait a minute.

274
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,670
<7-30,CASTLE>午夜  河边
<7-30,CASTLE>Midnight by the river

275
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:57,420
<7-30,CASTLE>到谢泼德·托雷斯[金牛座]购物广场
<7-30,CASTLE>At the Shepherd Taurus shopping mall?

277
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,570
<7-32,CASTLE>干得漂亮  走吧
<7-32,CASTLE>Well done. Let's go.

278
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:04,200
<7-33,ALEXIS>等等  我们不报警吗
<7-33,ALEXIS>Wait, wait. Shouldn't we call the cops?

279
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,350
<7-34,MARTHA>对  那附近不安全
<7-34,MARTHA>Yeah, that's a kind of dangerous neighborhood.

280
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,950
<7-35,CASTLE>女士们  下层住宅都高档化了
<7-35,CASTLE>Ladies, with all the gentrification going on,

281
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:11,470
<7-35,CASTLE>河畔的地产怎么会不安全呢
<7-35,CASTLE>there's no such thing as bad riverfront property.

282
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,050
<8-1,CASTLE>好吧  可能是我错了
<8-1,CASTLE>Okay. Maybe I was wrong.

283
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:17,520
<8-2,CASTLE>当心脚下
<8-2,CASTLE>Watch your step.

284
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:22,200
<8-2,CASTLE>也许我们该给埃斯波和莱恩发个短信
<8-2,CASTLE>Maybe we should be texting Espo and Ryan.

285
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,990
<8-3,ALEXIS>我已经打过电话了  他们在赶来
<8-3,ALEXIS>I already called them. They're on their way.

286
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:26,240
<8-4,CASTLE>我都不知道该庆幸还是该伤心
<8-4,CASTLE>I don't know whether to be happy or hurt

287
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,840
<8-4,CASTLE>你这么不信任我
<8-4,CASTLE>by your lack of faith in me.

288
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,070
<8-5,CASTLE>好吧  我是该庆幸
<8-5,CASTLE>Okay, I'm gonna go with happy.

<10-9,CHARISSE>Look, the aca-cons, we're all one-time offenders.

363
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:40,400
<10-9,CHARISSE>我们都很努力想不再走歪路
<10-9,CHARISSE>We work really hard to stay clean.

364
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:43,970
<10-9,CHARISSE>但艾格尼丝是个惯犯
<10-9,CHARISSE>But agnes... she's a repeat offender,

365
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:45,820
<10-9,CHARISSE>她根本不想从良
<10-9,CHARISSE>and she's not interested in changing.

366
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,260
<10-10,CASTLE>所以与其拿这样的大事冒险...
<10-10,CASTLE>So rather than take a chance before your big break...

367
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,410
<10-11,CHARISSE>我们踢她出局了
<10-11,CHARISSE>We kicked her out.

368
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:52,480
<10-11,CHARISSE>我们都投了票  但是罗宾去告诉了她
<10-11,CHARISSE>We all voted, but Robyn was the one who told her.

369
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,450
<10-11,CHARISSE>艾格尼丝很气愤
<10-11,CHARISSE>Agnes was pissed...

370
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:56,820
<10-11,CHARISSE>说罗宾在她背后捅刀
<10-11,CHARISSE>accused Robyn of stabbing her in the back.

371
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:01,140
<11-1,ESPOSITO>艾格尼丝·莫利纳  三次入狱
<11-1,ESPOSITO>Agnes Molina...  three-time loser

372
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:05,250
<11-1,ESPOSITO>前科累累  包括入室盗窃和伤人罪
<11-1,ESPOSITO>with a long list of priors, including b&e and assault.

373
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,680
<11-2,RYAN>看来现在又要加上杀人了
<11-2,RYAN>Looks like we can add murder to that list.

374
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,530
<11-3,ESPOSITO>我们比对了她的指纹
<11-3,ESPOSITO>Yeah, we ran her prints

375
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:09,150
<11-3,ESPOSITO>和剧院现场搜集到的指纹
<11-3,ESPOSITO>against the ones we found at the theater.

376
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:47,870
<11-3,ESPOSITO>最新美剧下载
<11-3,ESPOSITO>www.ZiMuZu.tv

377
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,060
<11-3,ESPOSITO>是匹配的
<11-3,ESPOSITO>We got a match.

378
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:12,140
<11-4,BECKETT>-那她现在在哪儿  -不知所踪
<11-4,BECKETT>- And where is she now? - She's in the wind.

379
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,440
<11-6,RYAN>艾格尼丝昨天没向假释官报到
<11-6,RYAN>Agnes didn't check in with her parole officer yesterday.

380
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,650
<11-7,ESPOSITO>警员搜过了她的公寓
<11-7,ESPOSITO>Unis searched her apartment.

381
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:17,210
<11-7,ESPOSITO>她似乎是打包离开了
<11-7,ESPOSITO>Looks like our girl packed up and left.

382
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:19,140
<11-8,BECKETT>肯定有人知道她藏在哪了
<11-8,BECKETT>Well, someone's got to have a lead on where she's hiding.

383
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:19,960
<11-9,ESPOSITO>我们也这么想
<11-9,ESPOSITO>Yeah, that's what we figured.

384
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,820
<11-10,RYAN>所以我们叫来了不倒退团体的组织者
<11-10,RYAN>Yeah, so we asked the couple that runs the N.B.P.

385
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,810
<11-10,RYAN>斯科特和琳达·温伯格夫妇
<11-10,RYAN>to come in - -  Scott and Linda Weinberg.

386
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:25,420
<11-11,BECKETT>好  我去和他们谈谈
<11-11,BECKETT>Great. I'll talk to them.

387
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:28,160
<11-11,BECKETT>你们去调查艾格尼丝  看能发现什么
<11-11,BECKETT>You guys dig into Agnes' life, see what you can find.

388
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:30,710
<12-1,LINDA WEINBERG>我们创办这个组织时还都是
<12-1,LINDA WEINBERG>We started this organization when we were both

389
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:32,450
<12-1,LINDA WEINBERG>年轻律师  想要回馈社会
<12-1,LINDA WEINBERG>young lawyers looking to give back,

390
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:35,830
<12-1,LINDA WEINBERG>看到对这些女孩的巨大帮助之后
<12-1,LINDA WEINBERG>and the difference we made for these girls was so profound

391
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:38,900
<12-1,LINDA WEINBERG>我们决定倾力帮助她们
<12-1,LINDA WEINBERG>that we dedicated our lives to helping them.

392
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:41,590
<12-2,BECKETT>你们了解艾格尼丝·莫利纳吗
<12-2,BECKETT>So, how well do you know Agnes Molina?

393
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,000
<12-3,LINDA>怎么了  她是疑犯吗
<12-3,LINDA>Why? Is she a suspect?

394
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,430
<12-4,BECKETT>是的
<12-4,BECKETT>Uh, yeah. She is.

395
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:49,800
<12-5,SCOTT WEINBERG>警监  艾格尼丝确实做了很多坏事
<12-5,SCOTT WEINBERG>Captain, Agnes certainly did some bad things in her life,

396
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,270
<12-5,SCOTT WEINBERG>但她人不错  不可能杀人
<12-5,SCOTT WEINBERG>but she's a sweet kid, not a killer.

397
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:54,020
<12-6,BECKETT>你知道她现在在哪里吗
<12-6,BECKETT>Do you have any idea where she is now?

398
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:55,000
<12-6,BECKETT>不知道
<12-6,BECKETT>No.

399
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,800
<12-7,SCOTT>上次被捕之后她父母就把她赶出去了
<12-7,SCOTT>I mean, her parents shut her out after her last arrest.

400
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,110
<12-8,BECKETT>那朋友呢
<12-8,BECKETT>And what about friends?

401
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,420
<12-9,LINDA>在监狱里有
<12-9,LINDA>In jail, yes.

402
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,610
<12-9,LINDA>但是外面就
<12-9,LINDA>But on the outside...

403
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:04,760
<12-10,SCOTT>只有组里的姑娘们了
<12-10,SCOTT>Just the girls in the group.

404
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,390
<12-11,BECKETT>肯定还有其他朋友
<12-11,BECKETT>There's got to be somebody else.

405
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,440
<12-11,BECKETT>如果艾格尼丝有麻烦她会找谁
<12-11,BECKETT>I-if Agnes was in trouble, who would she go to?

406
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,510
<12-12,LINDA>她有个前男友
<12-12,LINDA>There was an ex-boyfriend.

407
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:16,480
<12-12,LINDA>他到监狱看过她一次
<12-12,LINDA>He visited her in prison once.

408
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,830
<13-1,RYAN>前男友的名字叫德克斯特·格莱姆斯
<13-1,RYAN>Ex-boyfriend's name is Dexter Grimes.

409
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,170
<13-1,RYAN>他是个有前科的下岗焊接工
<13-1,RYAN>He's an unemployed welder and ex-con.

410
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,460
<13-2,CASTLE>听着像是个金龟婿
<13-2,CASTLE>Sounds like a real catch.

411
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,810
<13-2,CASTLE>另外  先生们  就像我说的
<13-2,CASTLE>And, gentlemen, as I told you,

412
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,680
<13-2,CASTLE>贝克特对我跟着来没有意见
<13-2,CASTLE>Beckett is fine with me riding along.

413
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,260
<13-3,ESPOSITO>对  她是没意见
<13-3,ESPOSITO>Oh, yeah, she's fine with it.

414
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,940
<13-4,RYAN>我记得她的原话是
<13-4,RYAN>I believe her exact words were,

415
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:33,460
<13-4,RYAN>可以  说不定运气好塞尔吃子弹了呢
<13-4,RYAN>"Sure. Maybe we'll get lucky and Castle will get shot."

416
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,840
<13-5,CASTLE>真的吗  过分
<13-5,CASTLE>Really? Ouch.

417
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:35,900
<13-6,ESPOSITO>你做了什么
<13-6,ESPOSITO>What'd you do?

418
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:38,020
<13-7,CASTLE>什么都没做
<13-7,CASTLE>Nothing.

419
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,970
<13-8,RYAN>你被扇耳光了  卡塞尔  你绝对干了什么
<13-8,RYAN>You got slapped, Castle. You definitely did something.

420
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,240
<13-9,ESPOSITO>还是干了谁
<13-9,ESPOSITO>Or someone.

421
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:44,410
<13-10,ESPOSITO>你出轨了
<13-10,ESPOSITO>You cheated?

<13-12,RYAN>卡塞尔  别跟我们撒谎
<13-12,RYAN>Castle, don't you lie to us.

424
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:48,200
<13-12,RYAN>贝克特是我们的家人
<13-12,RYAN>Beckett's our family.

00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,600
<13-12,RYAN>你对不起她  就是对不起我们
<13-12,RYAN>You cheat on her, you cheat on us.

<13-13,ESPOSITO>那个女的叫什么
<13-13,ESPOSITO>What's her name?

<13-14,CASTLE>伙计们  我说的是实话
<13-14,CASTLE>Guys, I'm telling you the truth.

00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,940
<14-1,RYAN>你最近一次见艾格尼丝·莫利纳是什么时候
<14-1,RYAN>When was the last time you saw Agnes Molina?

439
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:17,760
<14-1,RYAN>艾格尼丝吗
<14-1,RYAN>Agnes?

440
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:21,270
<14-2,DEXTER>好几年没见了  她被抓之前的事了
<14-2,DEXTER>Haven't seen her in years -- before she got busted.

441
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,290
<14-3,ESPOSITO>少蒙人  德克斯
<14-3,ESPOSITO>Nice try, Dex.

442
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:23,950
<14-3,ESPOSITO>我们知道你去监狱看过她
<14-3,ESPOSITO>We know that you visited her in prison.

443
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:25,250
<14-4,RYAN>她现在在逃
<14-4,RYAN>And now she's on the run.

444
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,730
<14-4,RYAN>你这么好  我们想她肯定跑到你这来了
<14-4,RYAN>You're such a catch, we figured she came running to you.

445
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:29,490
<14-5,DEXTER>我告诉你  我跟她已经结束了
<14-5,DEXTER>I'm telling you -- me and her are done.

446
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:31,050
<14-5,DEXTER>我不知道她在哪里
<14-5,DEXTER>I got no idea where she is.

447
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,150
<14-6,CASTLE>真的吗
<14-6,CASTLE>Is that right?

448
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:34,130
<14-6,CASTLE>那这个唇印是
<14-6,CASTLE>So, then, this lipstick is from...

449
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:35,510
<14-7,DEXTER>我妈的
<14-7,DEXTER>My mom.

450
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:38,200
<14-8,CASTLE>那么
<14-8,CASTLE>I suppose...

451
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,000
<14-8,CASTLE>这是你妈妈的内衣
<14-8,CASTLE>This is your mom's bra?

452
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:42,080
<14-9,DEXTER>对
<14-9,DEXTER>Yep.

453
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:49,830
<14-10,CASTLE>不太像
<14-10,CASTLE>Fat chance.

454
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:53,460
<14-10,CASTLE>事实上  德克斯特  我认为艾格尼丝藏在
<14-10,CASTLE>Matter of fact, Dexter, I believe Agnes is hiding...

455
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:55,970
<14-10,CASTLE>这里
<14-10,CASTLE>...right here.

456
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:01,290
<14-11,CASTLE>差点就骗到我了
<14-11,CASTLE>Almost had me.

457
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:03,680
<14-11,CASTLE>不幸的是我知道
<14-11,CASTLE>Too bad I know...

458
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:04,960
<14-11,CASTLE>她在这下面
<14-11,CASTLE>She's under here!

459
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,780
<14-12,CASTLE>天呐  谁把衣服堆在
<14-12,CASTLE>Man, who piles clothes under...

460
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:12,080
<14-13,CASTLE>有点紧张了吧  德克斯
<14-13,CASTLE>Getting a little nervous, Dex?

461
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:14,250
<14-13,CASTLE>我是不是越来越
<14-13,CASTLE>Am I getting...

462
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:16,130
<14-13,CASTLE>热[接近]了
<14-13,CASTLE>warmer?!

463
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:17,690
<14-14,CASTLE>不是吧
<14-14,CASTLE>Seriously?

464
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:23,260
<14-15,CASTLE>在那后面
<14-15,CASTLE>Behind the...

465
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:27,310
<14-16,CASTLE>我刚才就在那边
<14-16,CASTLE>I was right there.

466
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:32,890
<14-17,RYAN>就在这里
<14-17,RYAN>Yes.

467
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:39,310
<14-18,CASTLE>这应该是你的
<14-18,CASTLE>I believe this is yours.

468
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,530
<15-1,RYAN>我们知道你去过剧院  艾格尼丝
<15-1,RYAN>We know you were at the theater, Agnes.

469
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:46,720
<15-1,RYAN>我们发现了你的指纹
<15-1,RYAN>We found your prints.

470
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,370
<15-2,AGNES MOLINA>你们以为我为什么要跑
<15-2,AGNES MOLINA>Why do you think I ran?

471
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:50,440
<15-2,AGNES MOLINA>我一听说罗宾死了
<15-2,AGNES MOLINA>The second I heard Robyn was dead,

472
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,070
<15-2,AGNES MOLINA>我就知道你们会赖到我头上
<15-2,AGNES MOLINA>I knew you'd pin it on me.

473
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:54,010
<15-3,ESPOSITO>所以你是说  你没有杀罗宾
<15-3,ESPOSITO>So you're saying - that you didn't kill Robyn?

474
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:55,330
<15-3,ESPOSITO>因为我们听说她把你踢出组合
<15-3,ESPOSITO>'cause we heard you were pissed

475
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:56,720
<15-3,ESPOSITO>你很生气
<15-3,ESPOSITO>when she kicked you out of the group.

476
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,280
<15-4,AGNES>我的确很生气
<15-4,AGNES>Damn straight I was mad.

477
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,170
<15-4,AGNES>但是我没去计较
<15-4,AGNES>But I walked it off,

478
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:01,380
<15-4,AGNES>就像我的监狱辅导员教我的那样
<15-4,AGNES>just like my prisoner counselors taught me.

479
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:04,360
<15-6,AGNES>昨天是罗宾打给我
<15-6,AGNES>Robyn called me yesterday,

480
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,950
<15-6,AGNES>叫我昨晚十点去剧院见她
<15-6,AGNES>asked me to meet her at the theater last night at 10:00.

481
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:07,590
<15-7,ESPOSITO>为什么
<15-7,ESPOSITO>Why?

482
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:08,890
<15-8,AGNES>她说她需要一个保镖
<15-8,AGNES>She said she needed a bodyguard

483
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:10,870
<15-8,AGNES>需要人保护她
<15-8,AGNES>and somebody to keep her safe.

484
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:13,410
<15-9,RYAN>保镖  艾格尼丝  你好歹编得像一点
<15-9,RYAN>A bodyguard? Agnes, come on. You can do better than that.

485
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:15,820
<15-10,AGNES>是真的  她要给我五百块
<15-10,AGNES>It's true. She offered me 500 bucks.

486
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:18,000
<15-10,AGNES>有钱永远能使鬼推磨
<15-10,AGNES>Money trumps feelings every time.

487
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,810
<15-11,RYAN>好吧  那她要防着谁
<15-11,RYAN>Okay. Who did she need protection from?

488
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:21,780
<15-11,RYAN>我不知道
<15-11,RYAN>I don't know.

489
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:24,910
<15-12,AGNES>她只说是一个无伴奏比赛里的人
<15-12,AGNES>All she said, it was somebody from the a cappella competition.

490
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,970
<15-12,AGNES>她说等我到了再细说
<15-12,AGNES>She was gonna tell me more when I got to the theater,

491
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:30,110
<15-12,AGNES>但是我晚到了几个小时  她不在我就走了
<15-12,AGNES>but I was a couple hours late, and she wasn't there, so I left.

492
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,940
<15-12,AGNES>看来她当时其实就在那里吧
<15-12,AGNES>But I guess she was there, huh?

493
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,260
<15-12,AGNES>但已经死了
<15-12,AGNES>Dead.

494
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:44,010
<16-1,RYAN>罗宾被杀的时候  有人看到
<16-1,RYAN>We got witnesses that put Agnes in a diner across town

495
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:45,620
<16-1,RYAN>艾格尼丝在城市另一端一家餐厅里
<16-1,RYAN>during the time Robyn was killed.

496
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,880
<16-2,ESPOSITO>也就是说我们的凶手估计是
<16-2,ESPOSITO>Which means our killer is probably

497
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,660
<16-2,ESPOSITO>比赛里的人
<16-2,ESPOSITO>someone inside the competition.

498
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,210
<16-3,BECKETT>伙计们  谁给卡塞尔报了信
<16-3,BECKETT>Guys, who tipped Castle off?

499
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:53,300
<16-4,RYAN>不是我们  尤其他还...
<16-4,RYAN>Not us. Not after, uh...

500
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:55,170
<16-5,BECKETT>还怎么
<16-5,BECKETT>After what?

501
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,470
<16-6,RYAN>卡塞尔跟我们说了
<16-6,RYAN>Castle told us about...

502
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,640
<16-7,ESPOSITO>斯维特拉娜的事

<16-8,BECKETT>他跟你们说了
<16-8,BECKETT>He -- he...told you about...

<16-10,RYAN>我们很遗憾  贝克特
<16-10,RYAN>We're so sorry, Beckett.

507
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:11,330
<16-11,ESPOSITO>你想的话我们可以把他扔下楼梯
<16-11,ESPOSITO>If you want, we should throw him down a flight of stairs?

508
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:13,050
<16-12,BECKETT>不用了  我会...
<16-12,BECKETT>N-no, I'll -- I'll -- I'll take --

00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:17,640
<16-12,BECKETT>-不如你们进去找人问问话吧  -好吧
<16-12,BECKETT>- Why don't you guys go in and interview some people? - Okay.

<16-14,CASTLE>What?

513
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,000
<16-16,BECKETT>斯维特拉娜

00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:36,930
<16-17,CASTLE>嗯  我之前就想告诉你
<16-17,CASTLE>Yeah. I, uh, I was gonna tell you about that earlier,

515
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:39,400
<16-17,CASTLE>但我想我应该当面告诉你比较好  所以
<16-17,CASTLE>and I thought it would be better if I told you in person, so...

516
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:41,900
<16-18,BECKETT>-所以  -所以  小伙子们
<16-18,BECKETT>- So...? - So, uh, the boys --

517
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,920
<16-19,CASTLE>他们起了疑心  说我出轨
<16-19,CASTLE>they got suspicious and accused me of cheating.

518
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,120
<16-19,CASTLE>我慌了  所以现在他们以为
<16-19,CASTLE>I panicked, and now they think

519
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,670
<16-19,CASTLE>我在和一个叫斯维特拉娜的俄罗斯模特约会
<16-19,CASTLE>I'm dating a Russian model named Svetlana.

520
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:50,160
<16-20,BECKETT>你就不能起个好听点的名字吗
<16-20,BECKETT>And you couldn't think of a better name?

521
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,430
<16-21,CASTLE>对吧  我也觉得
<16-21,CASTLE>Right?! I know!

522
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:53,370
<16-21,CASTLE>那是我唯一能想到的名字  我也不知道为什么
<16-21,CASTLE>It was the only name I could come up with. I don't know why.

523
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:55,730
<16-21,CASTLE>不过说回来  她是个模特
<16-21,CASTLE>But still, she's a -- she's a model.

524
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:58,010
<16-21,CASTLE>是个非常非常火辣的模特
<16-21,CASTLE>She's a really, really hot model.

525
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,390
<16-22,BECKETT>算你说对了
<16-22,BECKETT>Damn straight she is.

<17-1,BECKETT>我们需要和负责人谈谈
<17-1,BECKETT>We need to speak with whoever's in charge.

529
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,000
<17-1,BECKETT>好的  我就是
<17-1,BECKETT>Yes, that would be me.

530
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,450
<17-2,BECKETT>我是拉森博士  全美无伴奏演唱大赛地区赛主管
<17-2,BECKETT>I'm Dr. Larson, director of the A.A.C Regionals.

531

<17-2,BECKETT>裁判长  全权负责这次比赛
<17-2,BECKETT>Head judge. I oversee all aspects of this competition.

00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:22,400
<17-2,BECKETT>那你一定认识罗宾·金
<17-2,BECKETT>Oh, so then you would have known Robyn King.

534
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:26,580
<17-2,BECKETT>不好说  她和我不是一路人  如果你懂我意思
<17-2,BECKETT>Vaguely. She wasn't my kind of people, if you know what I mean.

535
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,170
<17-3,CASTLE>你似乎对她的死讯并不吃惊
<17-3,CASTLE>You don't seem very shaken up about her death.

536
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:31,560
<23-8,HUNTER>当然这很可怕  但我并不能说感到吃惊
<23-8,HUNTER>Well, it's horrible, of course, but I can't say I'm surprised.

537
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,000
<23-9,RYAN>她和她的朋友  并不是全美无伴奏演唱大赛的料
<23-9,RYAN>She and her friends - are not exactly A.C.A material.

538
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,310
<23-10,HUNTER>因为他们有前科  你的意思是
<23-10,HUNTER>Because they're ex-cons, you mean?

539

541
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:42,210
<23-12,HUNTER>让她们这种人参与进来是个错误
<23-12,HUNTER>it was a mistake - to have their kind involved.

00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:44,100
<23-12,HUNTER>但是他们听了吗  没有
<23-12,HUNTER>But did they listen? No.

<19-11,RYAN>- Beckett. - Yeah?

585
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:36,880
<19-11,RYAN>你还好吗
<19-11,RYAN>You doing okay?

586
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:40,240
<19-12,BECKETT>还好
<19-12,BECKETT>Yeah.

587
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:45,120
<19-15,RYAN>我听到斯维特拉娜的时候  很难过
<19-15,RYAN>You know, I was crushed when I heard about...Svetlana.

588
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,240
<19-16,BECKETT>是吗
<19-16,BECKETT>You were?

589
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:57,230
<19-18,BECKETT>我觉得这样再好不过
<19-18,BECKETT>You know, I think it's for the best.

590
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,560
<19-19,RYAN>-是吗  -是的
<19-19,RYAN>- Oh, yeah? - Yeah.

591
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:02,850
<19-20,BECKETT>事实上  我也在和别人交往
<19-20,BECKETT>As a matter of fact, I'm dating someone else, too.

592
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:06,290
<19-20,BECKETT>一名医生  利文斯顿医生
<19-20,BECKETT>A, uh, a Dr... Livingstone.

593
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,760
<19-21,BECKETT>-莱恩  你听到了吗  -听到了
<19-21,BECKETT>- Ryan? Do you hear that? - Yeah.

594
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:38,400
<20-1,CASTLE>我的错  我全喷在自己身上了
<20-1,CASTLE>Oh. I got it. I spit all over myself.

595
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,810
<20-2,ESPOSITO>-正中我的眼睛  -我喷到你了也  抱歉
<20-2,ESPOSITO>- Got me right in my eye. - I got you, too? Sorry.

596
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:42,240
<20-3,CASTLE>只是一时忘情
<20-3,CASTLE>This made me -- caught up in the moment.

597
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,420
<20-3,CASTLE>卡塞尔  是你吗
<20-3,CASTLE>Castle? Is that you?

598
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:46,990
<20-3,CASTLE>贝克特
<20-3,CASTLE>Beckett?

599
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:48,030
<20-3,CASTLE>你们在做什么
<20-3,CASTLE>What are you doing?

600
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:49,180
<22-1,CASTLE>我们只是在
<22-1,CASTLE>We're just in --

601
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:50,440
<22-2,BECKETT>你们在做什么
<22-2,BECKETT>What -- what are you doing?

602
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,190
<22-3,CASTLE>我们在罗宾的化妆间里
<22-3,CASTLE>We're in the middle of Robyn's dressing room.

603
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:55,130
<22-4,BECKETT>她昨晚五点三十从这里跑出去
<22-4,BECKETT>She ran out of here at 5:30 last night.

604
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:57,110
<22-4,BECKETT>很显然  她当时非常沮丧
<22-4,BECKETT>Apparently, she was very upset.

605
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:59,660
<22-5,CASTLE>也许是因为她在这里听到的什么事
<22-5,CASTLE>Maybe over something she heard in here?

606
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:02,740
<22-5,CASTLE>你们其中有谁昨晚五点三十在这个房间吗
<22-5,CASTLE>Were any of you boys - in this room 5:30 last night?

607
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:04,250
<22-5,CASTLE>-没有  -不在
<22-5,CASTLE>- Nope. - No.

608
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:05,730
<22-6,CASTLE>我不在
<22-6,CASTLE>Not me.

609
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:11,470
<22-6,CASTLE>有人逃跑
<22-6,CASTLE>Got a runner!

610
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:25,330
<22-7,ESPOSITO>让开  让开  让开
<22-7,ESPOSITO>Move, move, move, move! Move! Move!

611
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,660
<22-7,ESPOSITO>不许动
<22-7,ESPOSITO>Don't move.

612
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:34,990
<22-7,ESPOSITO>好
<22-7,ESPOSITO>Sure.

613
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:40,120
<23-1,HUNTER>这都是个天大的误会
<23-1,HUNTER>This is all a big misunderstanding.

614
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,550
<23-2,BECKETT>你真的想玩这种游戏吗
<23-2,BECKETT>Do you seriously want to play that game?

615
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:43,080
<23-3,RYAN>我们无所谓  双手抱头
<23-3,RYAN>Yeah, fine by us. Put your hands on your head.

616
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,680
<23-4,HUNTER>等等  我们能做个交易吗
<23-4,HUNTER>W-wait. Can't we work something out?

617
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,000
<23-5,BECKETT>当然  如果你告诉我们真相
<23-5,BECKETT>Yeah -- if you tell us the truth.

618
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:51,190
<23-5,BECKETT>罗宾听到了你们化妆间里的一些事
<23-5,BECKETT>Now, Robyn overheard something from your dressing room.

619
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,370
<23-5,BECKETT>是不是
<23-5,BECKETT>Didn't she?

620
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:56,590
<23-6,HUNTER>我知道我们组合比不过无罪团  好吗
<23-6,HUNTER>I knew that my group couldn't beat the Aca-cons, okay?

621
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:58,130
<23-6,HUNTER>比不过她们那正能量的
<23-6,HUNTER>Not with their feel-good,

622
00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:01,020
<23-6,HUNTER>"无伴奏演唱团《女子监狱》版"的幕后故事
<23-6,HUNTER>"Orange is the new singing sensation" backstory.

623
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:05,520
<23-6,HUNTER>所以我  我就
<23-6,HUNTER>So I... I sort of...

624
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:08,510
<23-7,BECKETT>你是想操纵比赛结果吗
<23-7,BECKETT>Did you try to fix the competition?

625
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:10,910
<23-7,BECKETT>是的
<23-7,BECKETT>Yeah.

626
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:13,190
<23-8,HUNTER>-我贿赂了拉森博士  -主裁判吗
<23-8,HUNTER>- I bribed Dr. Larson. - The head judge?

627
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:14,980
<23-10,HUNTER>是他自己一直说个不停
<23-10,HUNTER>He was the one who was going on and on about

628
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:17,490
<23-10,HUNTER>说无罪团就不该来参加比赛
<23-10,HUNTER>How the aca-cons shouldn't even be in the competition,

629
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:19,520
<23-10,HUNTER>他们达不到全美无伴奏演唱大赛的标准如何如何
<23-10,HUNTER>How they weren't up to the standard of the A.A.C.

630
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,860
<23-11,BECKETT>他接受你的贿赂了吗
<23-11,BECKETT>And did he accept your bribe?

631
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,950
<23-12,HUNTER>接受了  但是罗宾无意听到了
<23-12,HUNTER>Yeah, but Robyn overheard us,

632
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:23,610
<23-12,HUNTER>我们的谈话  闯了进来
<23-12,HUNTER>and she burst in.

633
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:25,380
<23-12,HUNTER>她威胁说要向全国委员会举报
<23-12,HUNTER>She threatened to tell the national committee.

634
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,690
<23-13,RYAN>我看这就是谋杀动机
<23-13,RYAN>That sounds like motive for murder to me.

635
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:28,800
<23-14,HUNTER>对我来说并不是
<23-14,HUNTER>Not for me.

636
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:32,150
<23-14,HUNTER>拉森博士说他能搞定  就和罗宾一起走了
<23-14,HUNTER>Dr. Larson said he'd handle it, and then he left with Robyn.

637
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:33,580
<23-14,HUNTER>我只知道这些
<23-14,HUNTER>That's all I know.

638
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:36,080
<23-14,HUNTER>你们最好能解释清楚为什么把我拖到这里来
<23-14,HUNTER>You better have one heck of a good reason to drag me down here.

639
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,060
<23-14,HUNTER>我警告你们  我认识不少人
<23-14,HUNTER>I'm warning you -- I know people.

640
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,960
<24-1,RYAN>哦  我们也是
<24-1,RYAN>Oh. So do we.

641
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,910
<24-1,RYAN>比如亨特
<24-1,RYAN>People like Hunter.

642
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,080
<24-1,RYAN>知道吗  他交代说你受贿
<24-1,RYAN>You know, he told us that you took a bribe

643
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,150
<24-1,RYAN>要把无罪团清出比赛
<24-1,RYAN>to get the aca-cons out of the competition.

644
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,950
<24-1,RYAN>这是奇耻大谎
<24-1,RYAN>That is an outrageous lie.

645
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,900
<24-2,RYAN>那个叫亨特的家伙  我敢说他才是凶手
<24-2,RYAN>Now, that Hunter fellow -- I bet he's the killer.

646
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:56,270
<24-2,RYAN>是的  他这是利用你们
<24-2,RYAN>Yes, and he is trying to manipulate you. Mm-hmm.

647
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:57,450
<24-2,RYAN>说不定他说的对呢
<24-2,RYAN>Maybe he's right.

648
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:58,820
<24-3,ESPOSITO>是啊  说不定
<24-3,ESPOSITO>Yeah, maybe.

649
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:01,270
<24-3,ESPOSITO>等等  不可能是亨特
<24-3,ESPOSITO>No. Wait. Couldn't be Hunter.

650
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:02,920
<24-3,ESPOSITO>想起来了吗  他有不在场证明
<24-3,ESPOSITO>Remember -- he has an alibi.

651
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,850
<24-3,ESPOSITO>哦  对啊
<24-3,ESPOSITO>Oh, yeah.

652
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:05,170
<24-4,RYAN>对啊  真该死
<24-4,RYAN>That's right. Damn it.

653
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:06,370
<24-4,RYAN>我们觉得该回到原点怀疑你了  博士
<24-4,RYAN>I guess we're back to you, doc.

654
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,330
<24-5,ESPOSITO>所以你做了什么  安排一次会面
<24-5,ESPOSITO>So, what did you do -- arrange a meeting

655
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:09,770
<24-5,ESPOSITO>是不是罗宾不肯配合
<24-5,ESPOSITO>And when Robyn wouldn't cooperate with you,

656
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:11,310
<24-5,ESPOSITO>你就杀了她
<24-5,ESPOSITO>is that when you killed her?

657
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,280
<24-5,ESPOSITO>我没必要杀她
<24-5,ESPOSITO>There was no need to kill her.

658
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:15,920
<24-5,ESPOSITO>我们达成协议了
<24-5,ESPOSITO>We'd worked out a deal.

659
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:18,750
<24-6,RYAN>罗宾已经准备告发我了
<24-6,RYAN>Look, Robyn was all set to report me,

660
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:21,120
<24-6,RYAN>但是突然发生了奇怪的事情
<24-6,RYAN>But then something... peculiar happened.

661
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,040
<24-6,RYAN>奇怪
<24-6,RYAN>Peculiar?

662
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,150
<25-6,NARRATOR>是的  我们离开了亨特的化妆室  登台表演
<25-6,NARRATOR>Yes, we left Hunter's dressing room, and onstage,

663
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:26,690
<25-7,ROBYN>大家排练到一半
<25-7,ROBYN>The crew was in the middle of a tech rehearsal.

664
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:29,500
<25-8,NARRATOR>屏幕上播出了无罪团的介绍视频
<25-8,NARRATOR>The aca-con introduction video came up on the monitors.

665
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,900
<24-5,ESPOSITO>罗宾看了之后
<24-5,ESPOSITO>Robyn watched it.

666
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:33,200
<24-6,RYAN>突然之间
<24-6,RYAN>And then, suddenly, just like that...

667
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:35,400
<24-7,ESPOSITO>就改变了主意
<24-7,ESPOSITO>She changed her mind.

668
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:37,110
<24-7,ESPOSITO>你是说
<24-7,ESPOSITO>S-so you're saying

669
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:39,760
<24-7,ESPOSITO>罗宾看了个什么视频
<24-7,ESPOSITO>that Robyn changed her mind about ratting you out

670
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,510
<24-7,ESPOSITO>就决定不告发你了
<24-7,ESPOSITO>because of what she saw in some video?

671
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,490
<24-7,ESPOSITO>正如我所说  很奇怪
<24-7,ESPOSITO>Like I said, it was peculiar.

672
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:45,950
<24-7,ESPOSITO>但是罗宾保证只要我不接受贿赂
<24-7,ESPOSITO>But Robyn promised not to say anything,

673
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:47,180
<24-7,ESPOSITO>她就什么都不说
<24-7,ESPOSITO>so long as I rejected the bribe

674
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:50,170
<24-7,ESPOSITO>所以我给她拷了一份介绍录像
<24-7,ESPOSITO>And gave her a copy - of that introduction video.

675
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,650
<25-1,ROBYN>造化弄人  我进了监狱之后
<25-1,ROBYN>Ironically, I didn't find my love for singing

676
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:56,260
<25-1,ROBYN>才发觉自己对歌唱的热爱
<25-1,ROBYN>until I went to prison.

677
00:28:56,260 --> 00:29:00,310
<25-2,NARRATOR>18岁的罗宾已经有两年贩毒史
<25-2,NARRATOR>At 18, Robyn had already been running drugs for two years.

678
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:01,890
<25-2,NARRATOR>她的生活一片狼藉
<25-2,NARRATOR>Her life was a mess.

679
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:04,610
<25-2,NARRATOR>有一次给乡村俱乐部送货之后
<25-2,NARRATOR>And after making a delivery to a country-club party,

680
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:06,800
<25-2,NARRATOR>她偷车出了车祸
<25-2,NARRATOR>She stole and crashed a car.

681
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,000
<25-3,ROBYN>实际上  我烂醉如泥
<25-3,ROBYN>Truth is, I was so wasted,

682
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,190
<25-3,ROBYN>完全不记得当时发生了什么
<25-3,ROBYN>I don't even remember what happened.

683
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:13,480
<25-4,NARRATOR>罗宾被困在了着火的车里
<25-4,NARRATOR>Robyn was trapped in the burning car.

684
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:16,280
<25-4,NARRATOR>然后上天给她派来了一位英雄
<25-4,NARRATOR>But then, the universe sent her a hero.

685
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,590
<25-5,PERCY JOHNSON III>我开车回家路上  突然间
<25-5,PERCY JOHNSON III>I was driving home, and then --

686
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,770
<25-5,PERCY JOHNSON III>天啊  有车祸
<25-5,PERCY JOHNSON III>Oh, my god -- car crash.

687
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:23,490
<25-5,PERCY JOHNSON III>我把罗宾从车里拉出来  拖到安全地带
<25-5,PERCY JOHNSON III>I pulled Robyn out, I dragged her to safety,

688
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:26,660
<25-5,PERCY JOHNSON III>然后我只能用她的围巾
<25-5,PERCY JOHNSON III>And then I had to tourniquet her leg with her scarf

689
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:28,370
<25-5,PERCY JOHNSON III>给她止血
<25-5,PERCY JOHNSON III>to stop all the bleeding.

690
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:31,070
<25-6,NARRATOR>就像从灰烬中涅槃的凤凰
<25-6,NARRATOR>And like a phoenix rising from the ashes,

691
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:35,430
<25-6,NARRATOR>罗宾走出悲剧开始了全新的生活
<25-6,NARRATOR>Robyn emerged from this tragedy and started a new life.

692
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:38,320
<25-7,ROBYN>那场车祸是我生命中最好的事情
<25-7,ROBYN>That crash was the best thing that ever happened to me,

693
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,140
<25-7,ROBYN>因为入狱  我成功戒毒
<25-7,ROBYN>Because in prison, I got clean,

694
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:42,330
<25-7,ROBYN>加入了不倒退团体  并且
<25-7,ROBYN>Hooked up with the N.B.P., and...

695
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:44,180
<25-7,ROBYN>这挽救了我的人生
<25-7,ROBYN>And it saved my life.

696
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:48,940
<25-8,NARRATOR>女士们先生们  这就是无罪团
<25-8,NARRATOR>Ladies and gentlemen, the aca-cons.

697
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:52,130
<25-9,CASTLE>-为什么罗宾对此感兴趣  -注意了
<25-9,CASTLE>- Why would Robyn be so interested in this? - Hey.

698
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:54,840
<25-10,RYAN>我找到了罗宾从拉森博士那里
<25-10,RYAN>I managed to track down that cab that robyn jumped into

699
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,480
<25-10,RYAN>拿到视频后打的那辆出租车
<25-10,RYAN>After she got the dvd from Dr. Larson.

700
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,260
<25-11,ESPOSITO>她去哪儿了
<25-11,ESPOSITO>Where'd she go?

701
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,940
<25-12,RYAN>上东区的市政厅
<25-12,RYAN>Townhouse on the upper east side.

702
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:00,630
<25-13,ESPOSITO>看看住在那里的是谁
<25-13,ESPOSITO>And look who lives there.

703
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:03,340
<25-14,CASTLE>这绝对不可能是巧合
<25-14,CASTLE>That cannot be a coincidence.

704
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:07,870
<25-14,CASTLE>这么说
<25-14,CASTLE>So...

705
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:11,780
<26-1,BECKETT>你是不是在罗宾被害当晚见过她
<26-1,BECKETT>...you saw Robyn the night that she was murdered, huh?

706
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:12,900
<26-1,BECKETT>是的
<26-1,BECKETT>Yeah.

707
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:15,050
<26-2,PERCY>回头想想有点诡异
<26-2,PERCY>It's kind of eerie, - if you think about it, huh?

708
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:16,820
<26-3,BECKETT>是啊  我是说  她去找你做什么
<26-3,BECKETT>Yeah. I mean, why would she visit?

709
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,830
<26-4,PERCY>她是想亲自登门拜谢
<26-4,PERCY>Well, she wanted to thank me personally.

710
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,960
<26-4,PERCY>你看  我救罗宾的时候她昏迷不醒
<26-4,PERCY>You see, Robyn was unconscious when I saved her.

711
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,250
<26-4,PERCY>等她康复之后
<26-4,PERCY>Then after she recovered,

712
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:24,280
<26-4,PERCY>就直接进了监狱
<26-4,PERCY>She went straight to prison,

713
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,970
<26-4,PERCY>所以我们一直没机会正式见面
<26-4,PERCY>So we never actually properly met.

714
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:29,110
<27-1,BECKETT>波西  你是个真英雄
<27-1,BECKETT>Ah. Well, Percy, you are a real hero.

715
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,630
<27-2,PERCY>过奖了  你们才是英雄
<27-2,PERCY>No, you're the heroes.

716
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,700
<27-2,PERCY>我只是在正确的时间出现在正确的地点罢了
<27-2,PERCY>I was just in the right place at the right time.

717
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,990
<27-2,PERCY>别这么谦虚
<27-2,PERCY>Mnh-mnh. No, don't be so modest.

718
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:36,990
<28-1,BECKETT>如果不是你用围巾给罗宾的腿包扎
<28-1,BECKETT>If you didn't make a tourniquet out of that scarf,

719
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:39,210
<28-1,BECKETT>她可能就失血过多而死了
<28-1,BECKETT>Robyn could have bled out and died.

720
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,760
<28-1,BECKETT>说到那条围巾  是哪来的
<28-1,BECKETT>Speaking of that scarf, where did it come from?

721
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:44,710
<28-2,PERCY>是罗宾戴着的
<28-2,PERCY>Um... Robyn was wearing it.

722
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:45,790
<28-3,BECKETT>是吗
<28-3,BECKETT>She was?

723
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,730
<28-4,PERCY>那就有意思了
<28-4,PERCY>Oh. That's funny.

724
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,180
<28-5,BECKETT>因为我们联系了
<28-5,BECKETT>Because we reached out

725
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:52,320
<28-5,BECKETT>接收罗宾的那家医院
<28-5,BECKETT>to the hospital where robyn was taken,

726
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,970
<28-5,BECKETT>根据收诊表上的内容
<28-5,BECKETT>And on her intake form,

727
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:56,990
<28-5,BECKETT>存在一点时装界的悖论
<28-5,BECKETT>There's a bit of a-a fashion discrepancy.

728
00:30:56,990 --> 00:31:02,090
<28-5,BECKETT>你看  罗宾全身行头加起来也就50块钱
<28-5,BECKETT>Y-you see, Robyn's entire outfit was worth about $50.

729
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:04,440
<28-5,BECKETT>你用的那条围巾  可是爱马仕
<28-5,BECKETT>But the scarf that you used, it was an Hermes scarf,

730
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,010
<28-5,BECKETT>价值两千元左右
<28-5,BECKETT>And that was worth about 2 grand.

731
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:08,910
<28-5,BECKETT>所以我好奇的是
<28-5,BECKETT>So what I'm wondering is...

732
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,860
<28-5,BECKETT>你为什么说谎
<28-5,BECKETT>Why are you lying to me?

733
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,380
<28-5,BECKETT>好吧
<28-5,BECKETT>Okay.

734
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:18,730
<28-6,PERCY>你能保密吗
<28-6,PERCY>Can you keep a secret?

735
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:19,910
<28-6,PERCY>不能
<28-6,PERCY>No.

736
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:21,820
<28-7,BECKETT>但是那你也得告诉我
<28-7,BECKETT>But you're gonna tell me anyway.

737
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:26,060
<28-8,PERCY>救罗宾命的人不是我
<28-8,PERCY>I didn't save Robyn's life.

738
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,510
<28-8,PERCY>我赶到现场的时候
<28-8,PERCY>By the time I got there,

739
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,080
<28-8,PERCY>她已经安全了  但是浑身冰冷昏迷不醒
<28-8,PERCY>She was already safe and passed out cold,

740
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:32,310
<28-8,PERCY>腿上已经用围巾打好了绷带
<28-8,PERCY>And the scarf tourniquet was on her leg.

741
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:33,950
<28-9,BECKETT>你为什么说谎
<28-9,BECKETT>Why would you lie about that?

742
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,850
<28-10,PERCY>为了做英雄
<28-10,PERCY>To be a hero.

743
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:40,190
<28-10,PERCY>你知道这件事发生后我推特涨了多少粉吗
<28-10,PERCY>Do you know how many Twitter followers I got after that?

744
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:43,710
<29-1,BECKETT>这么说  罗宾知道了事情的真相
<29-1,BECKETT>So, uh, Robyn figured out what really happened,

745
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:45,400
<29-1,BECKETT>所以她才会去你家
<29-1,BECKETT>and that's why she came to your house?

746
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,350
<29-1,BECKETT>她想知道真相  我就告诉她了
<29-1,BECKETT>She wanted the truth, so I told her.

747
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:48,870
<29-1,BECKETT>有人把她从车里拉了出来
<29-1,BECKETT>Somebody else pulled her from the car.

748
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:51,560
<30-1,PERCY>他们肯定是...走掉了
<30-1,PERCY>Then they must have... run off.

749
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,000
<30-1,PERCY>一切肯定都跟这有关
<30-1,PERCY>That's what all this must have been about.

750
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,460
<31-1,ESPOSITO>罗宾在查探她被捕的事情
<31-1,ESPOSITO>Robyn was digging into her old arrest.

751
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:57,030
<31-2,CASTLE>是啊  她的发现导致自己被害
<31-2,CASTLE>Yeah, and whatever she found got her killed.

752
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,350
<31-2,CASTLE>视频里  罗宾说她嗨爆了
<31-2,CASTLE>In that video, - Robyn said she was so high,

753
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:01,590
<32-1,CASTLE>她什么都不记得
<32-1,CASTLE>she didn't remember anything,

754
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:05,130
<32-1,CASTLE>那她怎么知道是她偷的车
<32-1,CASTLE>So how does she know that she's the one who stole that car?

755
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:06,650
<32-2,ESPOSITO>因为波西告诉她  她是一个人
<32-2,ESPOSITO>Because Percy said she was alone.

756
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:08,850
<32-2,ESPOSITO>但他在说谎  有人在那
<32-2,ESPOSITO>But he was lying. Someone else was there.

757
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:12,510
<32-3,CASTLE>如果当时是那个人在开车呢
<32-3,CASTLE>And what if that someone was the one driving the car?

758
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:15,250
<32-3,CASTLE>你想想  逃离车祸现场的原因是
<32-3,CASTLE>Think about it -- a reason to leave the scene of an accident

759
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:17,220
<32-3,CASTLE>你是肇事者
<32-3,CASTLE>is that - you were the one responsible.

760
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:19,840
<32-4,ESPOSITO>有人撞了车  把罗宾拉出来
<32-4,ESPOSITO>So someone else crashed the car, pulled Robyn out,

761
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,660
<32-4,ESPOSITO>跑掉  让罗宾顶罪
<32-4,ESPOSITO>ran off, leaving Robyn to take the fall.

762
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:25,000
<32-5,CASTLE>但在那之前  那人用围巾包扎了罗宾的腿
<32-5,CASTLE>But not before bandaging Robyn's leg with their own scarf.

763
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,450
<32-6,ESPOSITO>就是说如果罗宾发现了围巾的主人
<32-6,ESPOSITO>So if Robyn found out who that scarf belonged to

764
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:28,210
<32-6,ESPOSITO>然后跑去跟那人对质
<32-6,ESPOSITO>and then confronted them --

765
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:30,150
<32-7,CASTLE>那人很可能就是凶手
<32-7,CASTLE>There's a good chance that person's our killer.

766
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:31,900
<32-8,RYAN>伙计们  我跟乡村俱乐部通了电话
<32-8,RYAN>Hey, guys, I talked to the country club,

767
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:35,100
<32-8,RYAN>我发现了开派对的人是谁
<32-8,RYAN>and I think I found the woman who threw that party.

768
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,250
<32-8,RYAN>她叫克洛伊·贾维斯
<32-8,RYAN>Her name is Chloe Jarvis,

769
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:40,700
<32-8,RYAN>而她  是长岛的帕丽斯·希尔顿
<32-8,RYAN>and apparently, she is, like, the Paris Hhilton of Long Island.

770
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:41,930
<32-9,CASTLE>听你的口气  好像这挺牛逼似的
<32-9,CASTLE>You say that like it's a good thing.

771
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:43,000
<32-10,ESPOSITO>但派对是好多年前了
<32-10,ESPOSITO>Yeah, but that party was years ago.

772
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,090
<32-10,ESPOSITO>我们怎么查出是谁戴了围巾呢
<32-10,ESPOSITO>How are we gonna find out who was wearing the scarf?

774
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:46,390
<32-11,RYAN>照片
<32-11,RYAN>Photos.

775
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:48,950
<32-11,RYAN>因为克洛伊有个疯狂照片集账号
<32-11,RYAN>Because Chloe has a snappamatic account.

776
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:50,000
<32-12,CASTLE>聪明
<32-12,CASTLE>Smart thinking.

777
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,230
<32-12,CASTLE>希望派对的照片还在上面
<32-12,CASTLE>Hopefully, the photos of that party are still up.

778
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,340
<32-13,RYAN>该死  克洛伊的账号是私密的
<32-13,RYAN>Damn. Chloe's account is private.

780
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:58,700
<32-13,RYAN>我们没有足够的合理根据  申请搜查令
<32-13,RYAN>And we don't have enough probable cause yet to justify a warrant.

781
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:01,860
<32-14,CASTLE>准确地说  是纽约警局需要合理根据
<32-14,CASTLE>Excuse me -- the NYPD may need probable cause.

782
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,740
<32-14,CASTLE>理查德·卡塞尔侦探社嘛  就....
<32-14,CASTLE>Richard Castle Investigations, however...

783
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:04,820
<32-15,ESPOSITO>不行  卡塞尔
<32-15,ESPOSITO>No, Castle.

784
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:06,450
<32-15,ESPOSITO>你不能
<32-15,ESPOSITO>You cannot...

785
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,690
<32-15,ESPOSITO>以纽约警局的名义  黑进克洛伊的账号
<32-15,ESPOSITO>hack Chloe's account on behalf of the NYPD.

786
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:11,360
<32-16,RYAN>我们绝对禁止你那样做
<32-16,RYAN>We absolutely forbid you.

787
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,320
<32-17,CASTLE>说实话  没了我  你们怎么破案
<32-17,CASTLE>Honestly, how did you guys ever solve murders without me?

788
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:17,260
<32-18,ESPOSITO>经常破案啊
<32-18,ESPOSITO>All the time.

789
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,300
<32-19,BECKETT>卡塞尔去哪了
<32-19,BECKETT>Hey, where's Castle going?

790
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:25,920
<32-19,BECKETT>那个...
<32-19,BECKETT>S--

791
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:28,360
<32-20,ESPOSITO>你不想知道的
<32-20,ESPOSITO>You don't want to know.

792
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,670
<32-20,ESPOSITO>贝克特  你不需要他
<32-20,ESPOSITO>'cause, Beckett, y-you don't need him.

793
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:33,220
<32-21,RYAN>听着  我就是想说
<32-21,RYAN>And -- and look, just so you know,

794
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,700
<32-21,RYAN>分手了  我俩归你
<32-21,RYAN>You get us in the breakup, okay?

795
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,320
<32-22,ESPOSITO>没错
<32-22,ESPOSITO>Oh, yeah. Damn straight.

796
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,870
<32-22,ESPOSITO>总之呢...
<32-22,ESPOSITO>Anyway...

797
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,430
<32-23,BECKETT>我在查阅苏福克郡警局
<32-23,BECKETT>Um, I was looking over Robyn's arrest reports

798
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:41,940
<32-23,BECKETT>关于罗宾的逮捕报告
<32-23,BECKETT>from the Suffolk County PD.

799
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,400
<32-23,BECKETT>没啥料  但是
<32-23,BECKETT>It's pretty thin, but apparently,

800
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,140
<32-23,BECKETT>他们保存室的证据箱不见了
<32-23,BECKETT>the evidence box in their property room is missing,

801
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:49,150
<32-23,BECKETT>也就是说要么他们本职工作干得很糟
<32-23,BECKETT>which means either they're practicing really shoddy police work...

802
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:51,420
<32-24,RYAN>要么有人帮助神秘车主陷害罗宾
<32-24,RYAN>Or somebody helped our mystery driver to frame Robyn.

803
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,170
<32-24,RYAN>没错
<32-24,RYAN>Exactly.

804
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:54,190
<32-25,BECKETT>当时执行逮捕的警官叫丹·奥格雷迪
<32-25,BECKETT>The arresting officer's name is Dan O'Grady.

805
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:57,550
<32-25,BECKETT>他刚刚退休  搬到了曼哈顿
<32-25,BECKETT>He just retired from the job and moved to Manhattan.

806
00:33:57,550 --> 00:34:00,090
<32-26,RYAN>-警察退休金住曼哈顿  哪那么容易  -是啊
<32-26,RYAN>- Kind of cushy - for a cop on a pension, huh? - It is.

807
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:01,430
<32-28,BECKETT>带他来问话
<32-28,BECKETT>All right, bring him in.

808
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,150
<32-28,BECKETT>我不知道该说什么  警监
<32-28,BECKETT>I don't know what to tell you, Captain.

809
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:08,230
<32-28,BECKETT>证据肯定是被错放了
<32-28,BECKETT>The evidence... must have been misplaced.

810
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:10,780
<32-28,BECKETT>电话问问接待警员
<32-28,BECKETT>Call the desk sergeant --

811
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:12,890
<33-1,BECKETT>不  证据不见了
<33-1,BECKETT>No, evidence is missing --

812
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,800
<33-1,BECKETT>尤其是那条被医院
<33-1,BECKETT>Specifically, the Hermes scarf

813
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,230
<33-1,BECKETT>送过去的爱马仕围巾
<33-1,BECKETT>that was sent over by the hospital.

814
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:18,210
<33-1,BECKETT>你把围巾搞到哪去了
<33-1,BECKETT>So what did you do with it?

815
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:21,050
<33-1,BECKETT>你以为自己是谁  丫头
<33-1,BECKETT>Who do you think you are, lady?

816
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:23,270
<33-2,BECKETT>我来这纯粹是给你面子
<33-2,BECKETT>I came here as a courtesy,

817
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:24,870
<33-2,BECKETT>你却指责我渎职
<33-2,BECKETT>and you're gonna accuse me of misconduct?

818
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:27,240
<33-2,BECKETT>我没有指责你任何事
<33-2,BECKETT>I'm not accusing you of anything.

819
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:29,180
<33-2,BECKETT>你的银行账户说明了一切
<33-2,BECKETT>Your own bank account is.

820
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:31,470
<33-2,BECKETT>罗宾认罪后一周
<33-2,BECKETT>A week - after Robyn took a plea deal,

821
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:36,060
<33-2,BECKETT>你五天存了五笔钱  每次都是9900美元
<33-2,BECKETT>You made five deposits -- $9,900 each -- over five days.

822
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,430
<33-2,BECKETT>我不必听你胡扯
<33-2,BECKETT>I don't have to listen to this.

823
00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:39,000
<33-3,BECKETT>一旦你离开这间办公室
<33-3,BECKETT>The moment you leave this office,

824
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,800
<33-3,BECKETT>我将给内务部打电话
<33-3,BECKETT>I will be calling internal affairs.

825
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,630
<33-3,BECKETT>你想让我跟他们说什么
<33-3,BECKETT>What do you want me to tell them?

826
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:45,530
<33-3,BECKETT>你协助侦破罗宾的谋杀案
<33-3,BECKETT>That you were helpful in solving Robyn's homicide

827
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:46,780
<33-3,BECKETT>还是你妨碍司法公正
<33-3,BECKETT>or that you obstructed justice?

828
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,300
<33-3,BECKETT>完全取决于你
<33-3,BECKETT>It's your call.

829
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:50,760
<33-3,BECKETT>听着
<33-3,BECKETT>Look.

830
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:54,790
<33-3,BECKETT>你...
<33-3,BECKETT>You, um...

831
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:58,280
<33-2,BECKETT>你得明白
<33-2,BECKETT>You got to understand.

832
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:02,770
<33-2,BECKETT>我当时还有四个月就要被强制退休
<33-2,BECKETT>I was four months away from mandatory retirement.

833
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,800
<33-2,BECKETT>我几近破产
<33-2,BECKETT>My bank account was a joke.

834
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:06,090
<33-2,BECKETT>我走投无路
<33-2,BECKETT>I was desperate.

835
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,670
<33-3,BECKETT>罗宾被捕后那天
<33-3,BECKETT>The day after Robyn was arrested,

836
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:09,500
<33-4,BECKETT>我接到了一个女人的电话
<33-4,BECKETT>I got a phone call from some woman.

837
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,410
<33-4,BECKETT>-谁  -我没问名字
<33-4,BECKETT>- From who? - I didn't get a name.

838
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:12,830
<32-17,CASTLE>她说如果我能把案子的证据
<32-17,CASTLE>She said she'd give me 50 Gs

839
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:15,180
<32-18,ESPOSITO>全部交给她  可以给我五万美金
<32-18,ESPOSITO>If I gave her all the evidence from the case,

840
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,000
<32-5,CASTLE>尤其是...
<32-5,CASTLE>Especially, uh...

841
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:18,830
<32-6,ESPOSITO>那条围巾
<32-6,ESPOSITO>That scarf.

843
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:25,430
<34-1,ALEXIS>进入了克洛伊的账号
<34-1,ALEXIS>I am in...Chloe's account.

844
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:26,580
<34-2,CASTLE>阿丽克西斯  搜索
<34-2,CASTLE>Now, Alexis, do a search

845
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:29,640
<34-2,CASTLE>克洛伊在乡村俱乐部高尔夫球场的派对
<34-2,CASTLE>for Chloe's golf course party at the country club.

846
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:38,670
<34-3,MARTHA>那是罗宾
<34-3,MARTHA>Oh, there's Robyn!

847
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:42,430
<34-3,MARTHA>她真是个可爱的姑娘
<34-3,MARTHA>She was such a lovely young woman.

848
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:44,580
<34-4,CASTLE>她没戴那条围巾
<34-4,CASTLE>And she's not wearing the scarf.

849
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:46,500
<34-5,ALEXIS>我没看到别人戴
<34-5,ALEXIS>I don't see anyone that is.

850
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:54,170
<34-6,CASTLE>等下  那里
<34-6,CASTLE>Wait -- there.

851
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:56,500
<34-7,ALEXIS>是那条围巾
<34-7,ALEXIS>There's the scarf.

852
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,600
<34-8,CASTLE>改变罗宾生活的那个女人
<34-8,CASTLE>So, the woman who changed Robyn's life

853
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:02,750
<34-8,CASTLE>同时也是毁掉她生活的人
<34-8,CASTLE>is also the one who took it.

854
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,800
<35-1,BECKETT>琳达  你是怎么认识罗宾的
<35-1,BECKETT>Linda, how did you know Robyn?

855
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:12,090
<35-2,LINDA>通过不倒退团体
<35-2,LINDA>Through N.B.P.

856
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:14,860
<35-2,LINDA>她是我们第一位囚犯参与者
<35-2,LINDA>She was one of our first prison participants.

857
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,440
<35-3,BECKETT>事实上  你们早在那之前就认识
<35-3,BECKETT>Uh, actually, you met long before that.

858
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:21,820
<35-3,BECKETT>只是罗宾醉得不省人事  不记得了
<35-3,BECKETT>Except Robyn was too wasted to remember.

859
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:25,260
<35-4,LINDA>我想我们都不记得了
<35-4,LINDA>I guess we both didn't remember.

860
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,840
<35-5,BECKETT>那是条漂亮的围巾
<35-5,BECKETT>That's a wonderful scarf.

861
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,050
<35-5,BECKETT>很昂贵
<35-5,BECKETT>Very expensive.

862
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:31,520
<35-5,BECKETT>你用它来救罗宾的命  真是太慷慨了
<35-5,BECKETT>It was very generous of you to use it to save Robyn's life.

863
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,660
<35-5,BECKETT>但那样做也是理所应当
<35-5,BECKETT>But, then again, it's the least you could do,

864
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,960
<35-5,BECKETT>鉴于撞车的人是你
<35-5,BECKETT>considering you're the one who crashed the car.

865
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,100
<35-5,BECKETT>我没有
<35-5,BECKETT>No, I didn't.

866
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:43,790
<35-6,LINDA>你知道吗  我记起来了
<35-6,LINDA>You know what? - it's coming back to me now.

867
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:46,720
<35-6,LINDA>在派对上  我把围巾给了罗宾
<35-6,LINDA>I-I gave Robyn that scarf at the party --

868
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:48,090
<35-6,LINDA>作为礼物
<35-6,LINDA>As a gift.

869
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:51,690
<35-7,BECKETT>听着  琳达  我知道  你害怕
<35-7,BECKETT>Look, Linda, I get it -- you were scared.

870
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:53,900
<35-7,BECKETT>如果你被发现  你会进监狱
<35-7,BECKETT>If found out, you would be sent to prison,

871
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,470
<35-7,BECKETT>被法学院开除
<35-7,BECKETT>kicked out of law school.

872
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:57,610
<35-7,BECKETT>你的未来将灰飞烟灭
<35-7,BECKETT>Your entire future would go up in flames.

873
00:36:57,610 --> 00:37:00,180
<35-7,BECKETT>于是你逃走  留下罗宾顶罪
<35-7,BECKETT>So you ran, and you let Robyn take the fall.

874
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,500
<35-8,LINDA>你证明不了
<35-8,LINDA>You can't prove any of this.

875
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,610
<35-9,BECKETT>不要这么确定
<35-9,BECKETT>I wouldn't be too sure about that.

876
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:07,600
<35-9,BECKETT>我追查到了打给奥格雷迪警官的电话
<35-9,BECKETT>I traced the call made to Officer O'grady.

877
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,770
<35-9,BECKETT>是你的手机打出的
<35-9,BECKETT>It was from your phone.

878
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:10,280
<35-9,BECKETT>我跟你的开户银行通过话
<35-9,BECKETT>I also spoke with your bank.

879
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,990
<35-9,BECKETT>他们找到了你贿赂他
<35-9,BECKETT>They found the $50,000 withdrawal

880
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:13,610
<35-9,BECKETT>的五万美元取款
<35-9,BECKETT>you used to pay him off.

881
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:21,640
<35-10,LINDA>我不知道我在想什么
<35-10,LINDA>I-I don't know what I was thinking.

882
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,560
<35-10,LINDA>我慌了
<35-10,LINDA>I panicked.

883
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:27,450
<35-10,LINDA>罗宾入狱后  我...
<35-10,LINDA>And after Robyn went to jail, I just...

884
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:30,470
<35-10,LINDA>我很愧疚
<35-10,LINDA>I felt so guilty.

885
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,760
<35-11,BECKETT>所以你才成立不倒退团体吗
<35-11,BECKETT>Is that why you started N.B.P.?

886
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:35,760
<35-12,LINDA>我以为那样会帮到罗宾
<35-12,LINDA>I thought maybe I could help Robyn,

887
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:38,350
<35-12,LINDA>弥补过失
<35-12,LINDA>Somehow make a difference.

888
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:41,520
<35-13,BECKETT>结果她发现了真相  跟你对质
<35-13,BECKETT>Except she found out the truth, confronted you,

889
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,960
<35-13,BECKETT>所以你杀害了她
<35-13,BECKETT>and that's why you killed her.

890
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:45,700
<35-14,LINDA>我没杀罗宾
<35-14,LINDA>I didn't kill Robyn.

891
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:47,600
<35-14,LINDA>我都不知道她知道了真相
<35-14,LINDA>I-I didn't even know she found out the truth.

892
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:49,410
<35-15,BECKETT>琳达  坦白吧
<35-15,BECKETT>Look, Linda, it's time to come clean.

893
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:50,580
<35-16,LINDA>我坦白了
<35-16,LINDA>I just did.

894
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:53,030
<35-16,LINDA>我撞了车  逃离现场
<35-16,LINDA>I crashed the car, fled the scene,

895
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:55,050
<35-16,LINDA>但我没杀罗宾
<35-16,LINDA>but I didn't kill Robyn.

896
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:57,910
<35-16,LINDA>谋杀发生时  我在费城出差
<35-16,LINDA>I was in Philadelphia on business at the time of the murder.

897
00:37:57,910 --> 00:37:59,560
<35-17,BECKETT>还有谁知道车祸
<35-17,BECKETT>Who else knew about the crash?

898
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:08,170
<35-18,LINDA>我想跟我的律师谈谈
<35-18,LINDA>I'd like to speak to my lawyer now.

900
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:15,610
<36-1,STAGE MANAGER>所有选手  最后确认  还是10分钟开场
<36-1,STAGE MANAGER>All groups, final checks. 10 minutes until curtain.

<36-2,MARTHA>理查德  感谢你让我来
<36-2,MARTHA>Oh, Richard, thank you for letting me be here.

<36-3,CASTLE>当然  老妈  你应该在这里
<36-3,CASTLE>Of course, mother. You should be here.

903
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,600
<36-4,SCOTT>琳达  是我
<36-4,SCOTT>Linda. Hey. It's me.

904
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,020
<36-4,SCOTT>演出要开始了  你在哪儿
<36-4,SCOTT>The show's about to start. Where are you?

905
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,880
<36-5,RYAN>温伯格先生  你可以挂掉电话了
<36-5,RYAN>Mr. Weinberg, you can hang up the phone.

906
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,420
<36-5,RYAN>你妻子被关在12分局
<36-5,RYAN>Your wife's being held at the 12th precint.

907
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:38,080
<36-6,SCOTT>为什么  怎么回事
<36-6,SCOTT>Why? What the hell's going on here?

908
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,990
<36-7,CASTLE>我们知道是你杀了罗宾
<36-7,CASTLE>We know you killed Robyn.

909
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:42,220
<36-8,SCOTT>这太扯了
<36-8,SCOTT>Excuse me, but that's absurd.

910
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:43,570
<36-9,ESPOSITO>我们排查了你的公寓
<36-9,ESPOSITO>We canvassed around your apartment.

911
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:45,090
<36-9,ESPOSITO>我们在垃圾桶里找到了一件你的T恤
<36-9,ESPOSITO>We found one of your shirts in a dumpster

912
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:46,530
<36-9,ESPOSITO>上面有罗宾的血
<36-9,ESPOSITO>with Robyn's blood on it.

913
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:49,270
<36-10,CASTLE>当她得知你妻子是车祸的真正肇事者
<36-10,CASTLE>When she realized your wife was behind the car accident,

914
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:51,240
<36-10,CASTLE>罗宾来找她了  不是吗
<36-10,CASTLE>Robyn came looking for her, didn't she?

915
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,530
<36-10,CASTLE>她很生气
<36-10,CASTLE>She was pissed.

916
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:55,720
<36-11,SCOTT>琳达出城了
<36-11,SCOTT>And Linda was out of town,

917
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:59,140
<36-11,SCOTT>所以我告诉她琳达会在她上班的地方跟她碰面
<36-11,SCOTT>So I told Robyn I'd have Linda meet her at her job.

918
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:01,480
<36-12,RYAN>但你不过想让她落单  以便杀了她
<36-12,RYAN>But you just wanted to get her alone so you could kill her

919
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:03,890
<36-12,RYAN>让妻子的秘密永不见天日
<36-12,RYAN>and bury your wife's secret forever.
