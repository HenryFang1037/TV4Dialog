<1-2,PATRICK>是希德·罗斯批的  希德想怎么样就怎么样
<1-2,PATRICK>Sid Ross did. And what Sid wants, Sid gets.

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,180
<1-2,PATRICK>他才不管电视网的意见呢
<1-2,PATRICK>He doesn't care what the network thinks.

6
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:20,650
<1-3,STACEY>那何必还跟他讨论卡司变动的事宜
<1-3,STACEY>Then what's the point of discussing cast changes with him?

7
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,200
<1-3,STACEY>反正他也会想做什么做什么
<1-3,STACEY>He's just gonna do what he wants regardless.

8
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,470
<1-4,PATRICK>一向如此
<1-4,PATRICK>As always.

26
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:06,190
<2-15,CASTLE>她在做48小时首句预热
<2-15,CASTLE>She's doing 48-hour first line.

27
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:09,190
<2-12,CASTLE>对了  你住在这里期间
<2-12,CASTLE>Oh, that's right. You haven't lived here

29
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:11,330
<2-12,CASTLE>还没经历过妈妈为首演做准备呢
<2-12,CASTLE>while mother is preparing to open in a play.

31
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:13,390
<2-12,CASTLE>信不信由你  但这是她
<2-12,CASTLE>This, believe it or not, is her little ritual

32
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:15,070
<2-12,CASTLE>进入角色的小仪式
<2-12,CASTLE>for getting into character.

33
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:16,070
<2-13,MARTHA>他死了吗

<2-14,BECKETT>好吧  那么这是正常的了
<2-14,BECKETT>Okay, so, this is normal?

35
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,300
<2-14,BECKETT>她是个演员  怎么算正常啊
<2-14,BECKETT>She's an actor. What's normal?

36
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,020
<2-15,CASTLE>我称之为"48小时首句预热"
<2-15,CASTLE>I call it "48-hour first line"

37
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:25,820
<2-15,CASTLE>因为首演前两天内
<2-15,CASTLE>Because for the two days prior to opening night,

38
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:26,730
<2-15,CASTLE>她就只肯
<2-15,CASTLE>she will say nothing

39
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:28,860
<2-15,CASTLE>说她角色在剧中的第一句
<2-15,CASTLE>but her character's first line of the play.

40
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:31,260
<2-16,BECKETT>好吧  还挺特别的
<2-16,BECKETT>Okay, that's unique.

41
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:32,360
<2-17,CASTLE>他死了吗
<2-17,CASTLE>Is he dead?

42
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,410
<2-18,MARTHA>但是她的剧不是下月才首演吗
<2-18,MARTHA>But doesn't her play open next month?

43
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:35,560
<2-19,BECKETT>是啊
<2-19,BECKETT>That's right.

44
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,950
<2-20,CASTLE>两天之后的是预演
<2-20,CASTLE>It's previews that are two days away.

45
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,710
<2-20,CASTLE>这是挺奇怪的
<2-20,CASTLE>Oh, no, that is odd.

46
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:42,910
<2-21,BECKETT>卡塞尔  发生了凶案
<2-21,BECKETT>Oh, Castle, there's been a homicide.

47
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:45,760
<2-23,BECKETT>-他死了吗  -很不幸  是的  玛莎
<2-23,BECKETT>- Is he dead? - Yes, unfortunately, Martha...

48
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:49,010
<2-24,BECKETT>嗯  当我没说
<2-24,BECKETT>Right. Never mind.

49
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:51,370
<2-25,CASTLE>说老实话  当初许下婚誓说要"同甘共苦"时
<2-25,CASTLE>Be honest. When you vowed "for better or for worse,"

50
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:53,640
<2-25,CASTLE>根本没想到会摊上这种事吧
<2-25,CASTLE>you really had no idea what you were getting into, did you?

51
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,630
<2-26,MARTHA>-他死了吗  -回见了  妈妈
<2-26,MARTHA>- Is he dead? Is he dead? - See you, mother.

52
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:57,520
<2-26,MARTHA>他死了吗
<2-26,MARTHA>Is he dead?

53
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,750
<2-26,MARTHA>他死了吗
<2-26,MARTHA>Is he dead?

54
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,980
<2-26,MARTHA>他...
<2-26,MARTHA>Is...

55
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,000
<3-1,CASTLE>我们可以去住酒店
<3-1,CASTLE>We can stay at a hotel.

56
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,630
<3-1,CASTLE>这样你就不用反复听她
<3-1,CASTLE>That way, you don't have to listen to her say that line

57
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,120
<3-1,CASTLE>-说那句台词了  -没事啦
<3-1,CASTLE>- over and over again. - No, it's okay.

58
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,850
<3-2,BECKETT>我们不会有事的  就是你妈妈有点...
<3-2,BECKETT>I mean, we're gonna manage. It's just, your mom's kind of...

59
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:09,290
<3-3,CASTLE>烦人  是啊  我知道
<3-3,CASTLE>Annoying? Yeah, I know.

60
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:10,890
<3-3,CASTLE>相信我  这算好的了
<3-3,CASTLE>Trust me, we're getting off easy.

61
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:13,070
<3-3,CASTLE>有次她的首句是
<3-3,CASTLE>One time her opening line was,

62
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:15,120
<3-3,CASTLE>"来啊  宝贝  我会让你爽到的"
<3-3,CASTLE>"Come on, baby. I'll make it worth your while."

63
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,170
<3-4,BECKETT>-我明白你意思了  -是啊
<3-4,BECKETT>- Ooh, I see what you mean. - Yeah.

64
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,440
<3-5,CASTLE>史上最尴尬的家长会
<3-5,CASTLE>Most awkward parent-teacher conference ever.

65
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:23,050
<4-2,LANIE PARISH>-蕾妮  -早啊  二位
<4-2,LANIE PARISH>- Hey, Lanie. - Good morning, you two.

66
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:25,100
<4-3,CASTLE>-这是  -希德·罗斯
<4-3,CASTLE>- This is... - Sid Ross!

67
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:27,380
<4-4,BECKET>《今晚周六夜》的编剧
<4-4,BECKET>The creator of "Saturday Night Tonight."

68
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,160
<4-5,CASTLE>是啊  还制作了好多的电影
<4-5,CASTLE>Yeah, not to mention all the movies he produced.

69
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,300
<4-6,BECKETT>-他是行业巨头啊  -怎么回事
<4-6,BECKETT>- The man's a mogul. - So, what happened?

70
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,160
<4-7,LANIE>他被用自己的领带勒死了
<4-7,LANIE>He was strangled with his own tie

71
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,980
<4-7,LANIE>然后被从7楼的SNT演播室
<4-7,LANIE>and then thrown down that elevator shaft

72
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,140
<4-7,LANIE>丢下了电梯井
<4-7,LANIE>from the "S.N.T." studios on the seventh floor.

73
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:39,670
<4-7,LANIE>尸体在电梯顶上躺了几小时
<4-7,LANIE>His body was on the roof of that elevator for hours

74
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:42,650
<4-7,LANIE>顶板终于支持不住  他才落了下来
<4-7,LANIE>before the panel gave way and Sid popped out.

75
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:45,010
<4-8,CASTLE>像地狱来的玩偶盒
<4-8,CASTLE>Like some jack-in-the-box from hell.

76
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,940
<4-9,BECKETT>-死亡时间  -从尸斑来看
<4-9,BECKETT>- Time of death? - Based on lividity,

77
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,860
<4-10,LANIE>晚上11点到凌晨2点间
<4-10,LANIE>between 11:00 p.m. and 2:00 a.m.

78
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,400
<4-11,CASTLE>看来希德在开夜车呢
<4-11,CASTLE>Looks like Sid was burning the midnight oil.

79
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,850
<4-12,BECKETT>我们问问保安  看他们是否知道
<4-12,BECKETT>Let's check with security, see if they know

80
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:53,690
<4-12,BECKETT>当时还有没有其他人在楼内
<4-12,BECKETT>if anyone else was in the building with him.

81
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,370
<4-13,CASTLE>考虑到我们在哪
<4-13,CASTLE>Considering where we are,

82
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:59,340
<4-13,CASTLE>或许是希德手下的员工杀了他
<4-13,CASTLE>maybe one of Sid's employees killed him.

83
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:02,170
<4-14,BECKETT>莱恩和埃斯波西托正带他妻子去警局
<4-14,BECKETT>Yeah, well, Ryan and Esposito are bringing his wife in now.

84
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:04,040
<4-14,BECKETT>或许她知道会是谁干的
<4-14,BECKETT>Maybe she knows who would have done this to him.

85
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,050
<4-14,BECKETT>大家都怕希德
<4-14,BECKETT>Everyone was scared of Sid,

86
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:09,550
<4-14,BECKETT>但他们不像我那么了解他
<4-14,BECKETT>but they didn't know him like I did.

87
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:14,130
<4-14,BECKETT>他们都把他当做冷漠的独裁者
<4-14,BECKETT>They thought he was just a cold, tyrannical dictator.

88
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,750
<5-1,KEVIN RYAN>听起来他有树敌
<5-1,KEVIN RYAN>Sounds like he had enemies.

89
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:20,550
<5-1,KEVIN RYAN>35年来他成就不少人  也毁了不少人
<5-1,KEVIN RYAN>After 35 years of making and breaking careers, you...

90
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,370
<5-2,RYAN>难免会惹到一些人
<5-2,RYAN>You're bound to piss off a few people.

91
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,550
<5-2,RYAN>《今晚周六夜》的人呢
<5-2,RYAN>Anyone at "Saturday Night Tonight" studio?

92
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,220
<5-3,ESPOSITO>他跟哪个雇员有矛盾吗
<5-3,ESPOSITO>Yeah, was he having trouble with any of his employees there?

93
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:29,390
<8-6,VOGEL>我不知道
<8-6,VOGEL>I don't know.

94
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:31,270
<8-7,TINA>可能吧
<8-7,TINA>Maybe. Uh...

95
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,200
<8-8,MICKEY>希德昨晚打给我  很奇怪
<8-8,MICKEY>Eh, Sid called me last night. It was odd.

96
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,830
<8-9,VOGEL>他说他要晚归
<8-9,VOGEL>Uh, he said he was going to be working late.

97
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:38,590
<8-10,LIZ>-这不寻常吗  -不
<8-10,LIZ>- And that's unusual? - No.

98
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:40,810
<8-11,BECKETT>他是个工作狂
<8-11,BECKETT>He was a workaholic.

99
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:44,220
<8-12,CASTLE>怪在他的语气  他很紧张
<8-12,CASTLE>The odd part was his tone. It was anxious.

100
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:46,140
<8-13,VOGEL>他说有人针对他
<8-13,VOGEL>He said someone was out to get him,

101
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,740
<11-2,CASTLE>他得处理一下
<11-2,CASTLE>and he needed to handle it.

102
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,590
<11-3,BECKETT>知道可能是谁吗
<11-3,BECKETT>Any idea who that someone might be?

103
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:52,620
<11-4,RYAN>我以为又是他生意上的事
<11-4,RYAN>Well, I just assumed it was one of his big business deals.

104
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,270
<11-4,RYAN>还有别人可能知道希德在做什么吗
<11-4,RYAN>Is there anyone else who might know what Sid was involved in?

105
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:58,420
<11-4,RYAN>是的  他制作公司的老板  基恩·沃格尔
<11-4,RYAN>Yes. The head of his production company, Gene Vogel.

106
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,640
<6-1,CHAD>沃格尔先生就在这边
<6-1,CHAD>Mr. Vogel is right over here.

107
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,140
<6-2,CASTLE>查德  是叫查德吧
<6-2,CASTLE>Chad... it's Chad, right?

108
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:05,340
<6-4,CASTLE>这是整35季以来的卡司照片吗
<6-4,CASTLE>Are these cast photos from all 35 seasons of the show?

109
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:08,230
<6-5,CHAD>是的  每位上过SNT的演员
<6-5,CHAD>Yep. Every performer who has ever been on "S.N.T."

111
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,580
<6-6,BECKETT>我最喜欢了
<6-6,BECKETT>That was my favorite.

112
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,860
<6-7,CASTLE>本国大部分的喜剧
<6-7,CASTLE>You know, a majority of this nation's comedy

113
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,060
<6-7,CASTLE>都来自这些天才的头脑
<6-7,CASTLE>was born in the minds of these geniuses.

114
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,640
<6-7,CASTLE>除了这一季  他们好烂
<6-7,CASTLE>Except for this season. Those guys sucked.

115
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,570
<6-8,BECKETT>-是啊  他们不怎么样  -这家伙
<6-8,BECKETT>- Yeah, they were terrible. - Oh, this guy!

116

<6-9,CASTLE>内德什么来着  他扮演手指医生
<6-9,CASTLE>Uh, Ned what's-his-name? He played, uh, doctor finger.

117
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:22,950
<6-9,CASTLE>抱歉  先生
<6-9,CASTLE>I'm sorry, sir.

00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,870

119
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,040
<6-9,CASTLE>你怎么可能不喜欢手指医生
<6-9,CASTLE>How can you not like doctor finger?

120
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,690

133
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,690

<7-7,DANNY VALENTINE>I remember when Sid asked me to host the pilot

<7-7,DANNY VALENTINE>这个疯狂的节目
<7-7,DANNY VALENTINE>of this...crazy show.

<7-7,DANNY VALENTINE>大家都说拒绝他  这节目不会火的
<7-7,DANNY VALENTINE>Everybody said, "Turn him down. Show's a dud."

<7-7,DANNY VALENTINE>然而35年后  还是势头不减
<7-7,DANNY VALENTINE>Well, 35 years later, it's still going strong.

<7-7,DANNY VALENTINE>我们通过尊重他的作品向希德致敬
<7-7,DANNY VALENTINE>We honor Sid by honoring his creation.

<7-7,DANNY VALENTINE>所以  我们开始演出吧
<7-7,DANNY VALENTINE>So...let's put on a show.

139
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,120
<7-8,BECKETT>沃格尔先生  不好意思  我是
<7-8,BECKETT>Mr. Vogel, excuse me. I'm --

140
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,440
<7-9,LIZ BELL>凯特·贝克特探长
<7-9,LIZ BELL>Detective Kate Beckett.

141
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,330
<7-9,LIZ BELL>你就是理查德·卡塞尔
<7-9,LIZ BELL>And you're Richard Castle.

142
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:32,360
<7-9,LIZ BELL>你好我是利兹·贝尔  《今晚周六夜》的总编剧
<7-9,LIZ BELL>Hi, I'm Liz Bell. I'm the head writer for "S.N.T."

143
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:34,050
<7-9,LIZ BELL>我非常崇拜你
<7-9,LIZ BELL>And I absolutely adore you.

144
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:36,780
<7-9,LIZ BELL>还有你  特别是你
<7-9,LIZ BELL>And you. Especially you.

145
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,460
<7-10,BECKETT>-我吗  真的吗  -当然啦
<7-10,BECKETT>- Me? Really? Uh -- oh, of course.

146
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,380
<7-11,LIZ>我一直关注你的事业  我曾想当个警察
<7-11,LIZ>I followed your career. I wanted to be a cop,

147
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,220
<7-11,LIZ>但最后却成了编剧
<7-11,LIZ>but ended up a writer.

148
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,490
<7-11,LIZ>是啊  很悲哀对吧
<7-11,LIZ>I know. It's pathetic.

149
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:47,630
<7-12,CASTLE>-你说什么  -我看了
<7-12,CASTLE>- Excuse me? - So I've seen footage

150
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,500
<7-13,LIZ>你办案时候的录像  我得问你
<7-13,LIZ>of your crime scenes, and I have to ask --

151
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:52,460
<7-13,LIZ>你是怎么做到一边办案一边保持发型的
<7-13,LIZ>how do you fight crime and keep your hair like that?

152
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,980
<7-13,LIZ>还穿着高跟鞋
<7-13,LIZ>And do it in high heels!

153
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:55,300
<7-13,LIZ>探长
<7-13,LIZ>Detective,

154
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,060
<7-14,VOGEL>我想你是为希德之死而来
<7-14,VOGEL>I assume you're here about Sid's death.

155
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,940
<7-15,BECKETT>-有什么能帮上忙  -我们与保安进行了核实
<7-15,BECKETT>- How can I help? - Well, uh, we checked with security,

156
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,720
<7-15,BECKETT>我得知大多数的员工
<7-15,BECKETT>and I understand that most employees enter and exit

157
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,310
<7-15,BECKETT>都是通过前门进出  但是显然
<7-15,BECKETT>through the front door, but apparently there's also

158
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,230
<7-15,BECKETT>-还有一个私人贵宾入口吗  -是的
<7-15,BECKETT>- a private V.I.P entrance? - That's right.

159
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:07,780
<7-16,VOGEL>希德是为了演员们设置了那个入口
<7-16,VOGEL>Sid had it installed for the actors

160
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:10,080
<7-16,VOGEL>让他们进出时能更为隐蔽
<7-16,VOGEL>so they could come and go with more privacy.

161
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,650
<7-17,CASTLE>那个私人入口处有监控摄像头吗
<7-17,CASTLE>Are there any security cameras on that private entrance?

162
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:13,460
<7-18,LIZ>他们是演员
<7-18,LIZ>They're actors,

163
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,780
<7-18,LIZ>他们会用那个入口做些别的事情  比如
<7-18,LIZ>so they also use it to do other things, like --

164
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,240
<7-19,VOGEL>希德决定不用监控
<7-19,VOGEL>Sid opted not to have surveillance.

165
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,060
<7-20,CASTLE>所以没有办法知道有谁
<7-20,CASTLE>So there's no way of telling who came in or out

166
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,870
<7-20,CASTLE>-从那个入口进出吗  -恐怕没有
<7-20,CASTLE>- of the private entrance? - I'm afraid not.

167
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,520
<7-22,BECKETT>昨晚有人在这里工作吗
<7-22,BECKETT>Was anyone working here last night

168
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:26,320
<7-22,BECKETT>在十点到凌晨两点之间
<7-22,BECKETT>between 11:00 p.m. And 2:00 a.m.?

169
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,800
<7-23,VOGEL>是的  所有的编剧和演员
<7-23,VOGEL>Yes. All the writers and actors.

170
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,270
<7-23,VOGEL>星期四是剧本改写之夜
<7-23,VOGEL>Thursday is rewrite night.

171
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:32,680
<7-23,VOGEL>大多数的人都在这待到第二天早上
<7-23,VOGEL>So most of them were here until sunup.

172
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,930
<7-24,CASTLE>在这些人中  有人和希德不和吗
<7-24,CASTLE>Of those people, did anyone have a problem with Sid?

173
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:40,340
<7-25,BECKETT>是谁
<7-25,BECKETT>Who?

174
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,320
<8-1,TINA TAMINO>对不起先生  我们还没开始营业
<8-1,TINA TAMINO>Sorry, sir, we're not quite open yet.

<8-2,LIZ>我把所有排练都录下来了
<8-2,LIZ>Uh, I record all of our rehearsals.

176
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:48,030
<8-2,LIZ>这是昨晚的事
<8-2,LIZ>This took place yesterday evening.

177
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:50,040
<8-3,TINA>伙计  你怎么穿着盔甲
<8-3,TINA>Dude, why are you wearing armor?

178
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,700
<8-4,MICKEY FRANKS>因为这个短剧太糟糕了  我要拯救它
<8-4,MICKEY FRANKS>Because the sketch sucks, and I'm trying to save it!

179
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,600
<8-5,CASTLE>麦基·弗兰克斯很搞笑
<8-5,CASTLE>Mickey Franks is hilarious.

180
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,780
<8-6,VOGEL>是啊  继续看
<8-6,VOGEL>Yes, well, just watch.

181
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,160
<8-7,TINA>麦基  你不能这么做
<8-7,TINA>Mickey, you can't do this!

182
00:06:58,170 --> 00:06:59,970
<8-7,TINA>希德已经批准了这个短剧
<8-7,TINA>Sid already approved the sketch.

183
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,540
<8-8,MICKEY>你知道吗  去他的希德
<8-8,MICKEY>You know, screw Sid.

184
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,170
<8-8,MICKEY>去他的希德
<8-8,MICKEY>Screw Sid!

185
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:03,740
<8-8,MICKEY>你想知道我觉得希德是什么样的吗
<8-8,MICKEY>You want to know what I think of Sid?

186
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,250
<8-8,MICKEY>我觉得希德就是这样
<8-8,MICKEY>That's what I think of Sid!

187
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,750
<8-8,MICKEY>希德去死  他是个死人
<8-8,MICKEY>Sid's dead, that's what he is!

188
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,400
<8-8,MICKEY>对我来说他已经死了
<8-8,MICKEY>He's dead to me!

189
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,310
<8-8,MICKEY>我会杀了他  他得去死
<8-8,MICKEY>I'll kill him! He's dead!

190
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:13,650
<8-9,VOGEL>他死了  死了  死了  死了
<8-9,VOGEL>He's dead! He's dead! He's dead! He's dead! He's...

191
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:17,810
<8-9,VOGEL>这季以来  麦基越来越不稳定
<8-9,VOGEL>Over this season, Mickey's become more and more unstable.

192
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:21,500
<8-9,VOGEL>情绪不稳定  突然发狂  自言自语
<8-9,VOGEL>Mood swings, outbursts, talks to himself --

193
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,870
<8-9,VOGEL>还和不在场的人说话
<8-9,VOGEL>and to people who aren't there.

194
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:25,110
<8-10,LIZ>但那是他第一次这样
<8-10,LIZ>But that was the first time he ever went this far.

195
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:27,130
<8-11,BECKETT>他为什么要对希德这么生气呢
<8-11,BECKETT>Well, did he have a reason to be angry with Sid?

196
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:28,570
<8-12,CASTLE>除了这个差劲的短剧外
<8-12,CASTLE>Aside from the lame sketch?

197
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:31,780
<8-13,VOGEL>事实上有  我昨天早上和希德谈过
<8-13,VOGEL>Actually, yes. I talked to Sid yesterday morning.

198
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,600
<8-13,VOGEL>他说他打算炒掉麦基
<8-13,VOGEL>He said he was planning to fire Mickey.

199
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,840
<8-14,CASTLE>他怎么想要解雇他的明星呢
<8-14,CASTLE>How can he fire his star?

200
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,460
<8-15,VOGEL>他很不稳定  难以预测
<8-15,VOGEL>Ah...he's volatile, unpredictable.

201
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:41,990
<8-15,VOGEL>越来越像个累赘
<8-15,VOGEL>He's become more and more of a liability.

202
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:44,990
<8-16,BECKETT>沃格尔先生  昨晚希德和麦基摊牌了吗
<8-16,BECKETT>Mr. Vogel, did Sid break the news to Mickey last night?

203
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,930
<8-17,VOGEL>我不知道  有可能
<8-17,VOGEL>I don't know, but he might have.

204
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:49,060
<8-18,BECKETT>麦基没有参加为希德举办的聚会
<8-18,BECKETT>Well, Mickey wasn't at the gathering for Sid.

205
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,750
<8-18,BECKETT>-他在大楼内吗  -如果他在的话
<8-18,BECKETT>- Is he in the building? - If he is,

206
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,230
<8-19,LIZ>他肯定会在服装道具室里面
<8-19,LIZ>he'll be in the wardrobe and props room.

207
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:54,580
<8-19,LIZ>他经常在那想新的角色
<8-19,LIZ>He hangs out there to develop new characters.

208
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:59,180
<9-1,BECKETT>有人在吗
<9-1,BECKETT>Hello? Anybody there?

209
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,640
<9-2,CASTLE>我真希望麦基不是凶手
<9-2,CASTLE>I'm really hoping Mickey's not the one behind this.

210
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,120
<9-2,CASTLE>这人在节目里实在是太搞笑了
<9-2,CASTLE>I mean, the man is just so damn funny on the show,

211
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:05,600
<9-2,CASTLE>即使在很烂的几集里
<9-2,CASTLE>even the crappy episodes.

212
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,770
<9-2,CASTLE>这家伙太搞笑了
<9-2,CASTLE>Guy's hysterical.

213
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:09,250
<9-3,BECKETT>而且很可能精神崩溃
<9-3,BECKETT>And quite possibly suffering a psychotic break.

214
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:13,100
<9-4,CASTLE>对啊  天才和疯子只有一线之差
<9-4,CASTLE>Yes. The fine line between genius and madness.

215
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,360
<9-5,CASTLE>麦基·弗兰克斯  是你吗
<9-5,CASTLE>Mickey Franks, is that you?

216
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,770
<9-5,CASTLE>不好意思
<9-5,CASTLE>I'm sorry.

217
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:29,240
<9-6,MICKEY>你肯定是把我当做另一套盔甲了
<9-6,MICKEY>You must have mistaken me for another suit of armor.

218
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,800
<9-6,MICKEY>恕我失陪
<9-6,MICKEY>Now if you'll excuse me.

219
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,730
<9-7,BECKETT>纽约警局  我们得谈谈
<9-7,BECKETT>N.Y.P.D. We need to talk.

220
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:37,620
<9-8,MICKEY>你别想活捉我  警察
<9-8,MICKEY>You'll never take me alive, copper!

221
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:42,350
<9-9,MICKEY>天哪  我的胰腺啊
<9-9,MICKEY>Oh! My pancreas!

222
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:49,180
<9-10,CASTLE>你瞧啊  即使被捕他还是很搞笑
<9-10,CASTLE>You see what I'm saying? Even arrested, he's hilarious!

<10-3,BECKETT>Uh, Mr. Franks,

240
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,930
<10-3,BECKETT>你昨晚恐吓了希德·罗斯
<10-3,BECKETT>you made some threats against Sid Ross last night.

241
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:29,550
<10-4,MICKEY>你说得对  别回答
<10-4,MICKEY>You're damn right I -- don't answer that!

242
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:34,730
<10-4,MICKEY>探长  请让我来回答你的问题
<10-4,MICKEY>Detective, address your questions to me, please.

243
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:35,890
<10-4,MICKEY>谢谢
<10-4,MICKEY>Thank you.

244
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:40,880
<10-5,BECKETT>你在哪里
<10-5,BECKETT>Uh, where were --

245
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,830
<10-5,BECKETT>昨晚十一点到凌晨两点
<10-5,BECKETT>Where...was your client

246
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:47,400
<10-5,BECKETT>你的委托人在哪里
<10-5,BECKETT>between 11:00 p.m. and 2:00 a.m. last night?

247
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,550
<10-6,MICKEY>他在做他自己的事
<10-6,MICKEY>He was minding his own damn business!

248
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:51,490
<10-6,MICKEY>我的委托人是一位正直的公民
<10-6,MICKEY>My client is an upstanding citizen

249
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:52,700
<10-6,MICKEY>并且是社会的砥柱中流
<10-6,MICKEY>and a pillar of the community.

250
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,780
<10-6,MICKEY>更别说他还是个幽默的混小子
<10-6,MICKEY>Not to mention, he's also one funny mother-fudgesicle.

251
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:58,060
<10-6,MICKEY>注意你的措辞
<10-6,MICKEY>Hey, watch your language.

252
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,180
<10-7,BECKETT>麦基  发生了什么
<10-7,BECKETT>What happened, Mickey?

253
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:01,820
<10-7,BECKETT>是希德跟你说你被解雇了
<10-7,BECKETT>Did Sid tell you you were fired,

254
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,290
<10-7,BECKETT>你就暴发把他给杀了
<10-7,BECKETT>so you snapped and killed him?

255
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,260
<10-8,MICKEY>等等  什么
<10-8,MICKEY>Hold on, what?

256
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,770
<10-8,MICKEY>希德死了吗
<10-8,MICKEY>Sid -- Sid's dead?

257
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:12,520
<10-9,MICKEY>嘿  我  我
<10-9,MICKEY>Whoa, hey, oh -- oh, whoa, I --

258
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:14,130
<10-9,MICKEY>我没有杀他
<10-9,MICKEY>I didn't kill him.

259
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,990
<10-10,CASTLE>你不再向你的律师求助了
<10-10,CASTLE>I noticed you're no long seeking counsel from your attorney.

260
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:19,120
<10-11,MICKEY>没有  那就是表演
<10-11,MICKEY>Yeah, no, that's -- that's just an act.

261
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,190
<10-11,MICKEY>我没疯
<10-11,MICKEY>I mean...I'm not crazy.

262
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:24,120
<10-11,MICKEY>我只是花了一年的时间让大家觉得我疯了
<10-11,MICKEY>Just spent a year of my life convincing people that I was.

263
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,940
<10-12,BECKETT>这件事上你做得非常好
<10-12,BECKETT>Yeah, and you've done a pretty good job of it.

264
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,440
<10-13,MICKEY>我是个演员  好吗
<10-13,MICKEY>I'm an actor, okay?

265
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:30,090
<10-13,MICKEY>我是个签了很长合约的演员
<10-13,MICKEY>I am an actor that's tied to a long-term contract

266
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:33,660
<10-13,MICKEY>而且这份合约还让我入不敷出
<10-13,MICKEY>that's, uh...not exactly covering his expenses.

267
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,560
<10-14,CASTLE>你是说你想被解雇掉
<10-14,CASTLE>Are you saying you were trying to get fired?

268
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:37,460
<10-14,CASTLE>我是说  希德掌控了我的演艺生涯
<10-14,CASTLE>I mean, Sid controls my career.

269
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:40,360
<10-15,MICKEY>因为他  我错失了很多电影主演的机会
<10-15,MICKEY>Because of him, I'm missing out on major movie roles.

270
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:42,160
<10-15,MICKEY>所以我才袭击了你们
<10-15,MICKEY>That's why I attacked you guys.

271
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,520
<10-15,MICKEY>我想如果你们能认定我是精神病患者
<10-15,MICKEY>I figured maybe if you 5150 me on a bellevue psych hold,

273
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,210
<10-15,MICKEY>他就终于会想摆脱我
<10-15,MICKEY>he would finally cut me loose.

274
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:48,590
<10-16,BECKETT>好吧  不管疯不疯
<10-16,BECKETT>Okay, look, crazy or not,

275
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:50,940
<10-16,BECKETT>你始终撂狠话威胁了希德
<10-16,BECKETT>You still made some pretty serious threats against Sid,

276
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,540
<10-16,BECKETT>而几小时后他就死了
<10-16,BECKETT>and hours later he ended up dead.

277
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,670
<10-17,MICKEY>好吧  你问我当时在哪是吧
<10-17,MICKEY>Okay -- you're asking my whereabouts, right? Mm.

278
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:59,150
<10-18,BECKETT>我整晚都在楼上的屋顶酒吧喝酒
<10-18,BECKETT>Okay, I was upstairs at the rooftop bar getting wasted all night.

279
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:01,770
<10-19,MICKEY>凌晨三点左右我跌跌撞撞地去了服装道具室
<10-19,MICKEY>And then I stumbled down to the wardrobe and props room

280
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:04,140
<10-19,MICKEY>然后就不省人事了
<10-19,MICKEY>at about 3:00 A.M. and passed out.

281
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,190
<10-19,MICKEY>你们进来的时候我才刚醒
<10-19,MICKEY>I had just woken up when you guys came in.

282
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,250
<10-19,MICKEY>而且  我都不知道希德死了
<10-19,MICKEY>Plus, I had no idea Sid was even dead,

283
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,580
<10-19,MICKEY>-我怎么可能跟这事有关呢  -好吧
<10-19,MICKEY>- so how could I have had anything to do with it? - Okay.

284
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:14,260
<10-21,MICKEY>不过  我可能知道是谁干的
<10-21,MICKEY>Look, I might know who did!

285
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,230
<10-20,BECKETT>好啊
<10-20,BECKETT>Okay.

286
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:17,690
<10-22,BECKETT>我们听着呢
<10-22,BECKETT>We're listening.

287
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:20,300
<10-23,MICKEY>昨晚大约九点左右
<10-23,MICKEY>Look, at around 9:00 P.M. Last night,

288
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,750
<10-23,MICKEY>我去了希德的办公室
<10-23,MICKEY>I...did go to Sid's office

289
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,890
<10-23,MICKEY>想求他解除我的合同
<10-23,MICKEY>to beg to be let out of my contract.

290
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:28,300
<10-23,MICKEY>可我根本没进去  因为我听到他在打电话
<10-23,MICKEY>But I never went in because I heard him on the phone.

291
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,030
<10-24,BECKETT>他在冲某人大吼
<10-24,BECKETT>He was yelling at someone.

292
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:32,040
<10-24,BECKETT>-他在吼谁  -不知道
<10-24,BECKETT>- Who was he yelling at? - I don't know.

293
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,310
<10-25,MICKEY>但好像跟什么交易有关
<10-25,MICKEY>But it had something to do with a deal

294
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:34,780
<10-25,MICKEY>是要半夜进行的
<10-25,MICKEY>that was going down around midnight.

295
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,890
<10-26,CASTLE>半夜  他说了是什么交易吗
<10-26,CASTLE>Midnight? Did he say what the deal was?

296
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:38,840
<10-27,MICKEY>没有  但希德在电话里告诉那人
<10-27,MICKEY>No. But Sid told that person on the phone

297
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,070
<10-27,MICKEY>他们最好按什么约定来  否则后果自负
<10-27,MICKEY>they better stick to the agreement, or else.

298
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:46,020
<10-28,MICKEY>我能打给我真正的律师了吗
<10-28,MICKEY>Can I call my real attorney?

299
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:48,410
<11-1,BECKETT>酒保证实了麦基的不在场证明
<11-1,BECKETT>The bartender confirmed Mickey's alibi.

300
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:49,640
<11-1,BECKETT>他不是凶手
<11-1,BECKETT>He's not our killer.

301
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,530
<11-2,CASTLE>那可以假设麦基说的是实话了
<11-2,CASTLE>Well, then we can assume Mickey was telling the truth

302
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:53,350
<11-2,CASTLE>他确实听到了希德的那通电话
<11-2,CASTLE>about the phone call he overheard Sid making.

303
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:56,100
<11-3,BECKETT>对  但希德会在大半夜做什么交易呢
<11-3,BECKETT>Yeah, but what kind of deal would Sid be making at midnight?

304
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:59,060
<11-4,RYAN>不管是什么  这事跟他死亡的时间线吻合
<11-4,RYAN>Whatever it was, it went down in the middle of his time of death window.

305
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,700
<11-5,CASTLE>所以可能跟他的死有关
<11-5,CASTLE>So this deal could be connected to his death.

306
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,410
<11-5,CASTLE>我们得查清跟希德通电话的人是谁
<11-5,CASTLE>We need to figure out who Sid was talking on the phone with.

307
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:04,720
<11-6,ESPOSITO>你倒是站着说话不腰痛
<11-6,ESPOSITO>Well, that's easier said than done.

308
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,370
<11-6,ESPOSITO>我刚查了希德的通话记录
<11-6,ESPOSITO>I just got Sid's phone dump.

309
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:07,430
<11-6,ESPOSITO>昨晚九点有一通电话
<11-6,ESPOSITO>A 9:00 P.M. Phone call

310
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:09,570
<11-6,ESPOSITO>来自一部反追踪的一次性手机
<11-6,ESPOSITO>came from an untraceable burner phone.

311
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,580
<11-7,BECKETT>这样吧  不如我们先找找希德的生意伙伴
<11-7,BECKETT>You know what? Why don't we get ahold of Sid's associates,

312
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,190
<11-7,BECKETT>看看他们是否有人知道是什么交易
<11-7,BECKETT>see if any of them know what this deal was.

313
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,550
<11-8,ESPOSITO>我知道该从谁开始
<11-8,ESPOSITO>I know who exactly who to start with.

314
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:16,130
<11-8,ESPOSITO>就在那通神秘电话后
<11-8,ESPOSITO>Right after that mystery call,

315
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:18,210
<11-8,ESPOSITO>希德给丹尼·瓦伦汀打了电话
<11-8,ESPOSITO>Sid phoned none other than Danny Valentine.

316
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:20,930
<11-8,ESPOSITO>要是有人知道那交易是什么  一定是瓦伦汀
<11-8,ESPOSITO>If anyone knows about that deal, it's Valentine.

317
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:24,380
<12-1,VALENTINE>探长  我完全不知道你在说什么
<12-1,VALENTINE>Detective, I have no idea what you're talking about.

318
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:27,180
<12-2,TINA>伙计  我是警察  而且是模特
<12-2,TINA>Look, buddy, I'm a cop and a model,

319
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,380
<12-2,TINA>我能看出来有人在说谎
<12-2,TINA>So I know when someone's lying to me.

320
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,530
<12-2,TINA>或是衣服穿得不合适
<12-2,TINA>and when their outfit is clashing.

321
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:33,950
<12-2,TINA>退后  这可能很危险
<12-2,TINA>Now stand back! This could be dangerous!

322
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:36,560
<12-3,VALENTINE>别担心  我写罪案小说的经验
<12-3,VALENTINE>Don't worry. My experience writing crime novels

323
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,170
<12-3,VALENTINE>已经帮我做好了应对危险的准备
<12-3,VALENTINE>has prepared me for danger.

324
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:40,750
<12-3,VALENTINE>而且  我还有防弹衣呢
<12-3,VALENTINE>Plus, I have my vest.

<12-4,TINA>小心点  坏蛋们  我们来了
<12-4,TINA>Look out, bad guys, here we come!

<12-6,LIZ>完成  很好  伙计们
<12-6,LIZ>And scene! Great job, guys.

329
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,800
<12-7,BECKETT>真不知道我们该觉得荣幸还是生气
<12-7,BECKETT>Okay, well, I don't know whether we should be flattered or offended.

330
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,280
<12-8,CASTLE>谁在乎啊  丹尼·瓦伦汀在演我
<12-8,CASTLE>Who cares? Danny Valentine's playing me!

<12-11,CASTLE>丹尼·瓦伦汀演的是我
<12-11,CASTLE>Danny Valentine's playing me.

<13-1,VALENTINE>My, uh, my car rental commercials?

349
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:48,380
<13-2,BECKETT>我在大学的时候确实看过
<13-2,BECKETT>Uh, yeah, well, I-I did catch my fair share

350
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:50,590
<13-2,BECKETT>《通缉犯》的重播
<13-2,BECKETT>of "Hot suspect" reruns in college.

351
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,880
<13-3,VALENTINE>我就知道  警察肯定爱看警匪剧
<13-3,VALENTINE>I knew it! The cop watched the cop show.

352
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:56,680
<13-3,VALENTINE>承认吧  我激发了你当警察的志向  对不对
<13-3,VALENTINE>Come on, I inspired you to become a detective, didn't I? Huh?

353
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,130
<13-4,BECKETT>可能有点吧
<13-4,BECKETT>Maybe a little bit.

354
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:02,880
<13-5,CASTLE>我们在调查一起谋杀案  对吧
<13-5,CASTLE>We're investigating a murder, right?

355
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:08,000
<13-6,BECKETT>对对  我们查了希德的电话记录
<13-6,BECKETT>Right. Yeah. Uh, so... we checked Sid's phone records,

356
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,280
<13-6,BECKETT>看来他昨晚9:03给你打过电话
<13-6,BECKETT>and apparently he called you at 9:03 last night.

357
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,690
<13-6,BECKETT>能告诉我们为什么吗
<13-6,BECKETT>Can you tell us why?

358
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:14,960
<13-7,VALENTINE>我本来要去跟希德和他前妻伊芙琳小酌几杯的
<13-7,VALENTINE>Yeah, I was supposed to have drinks with sid and his ex, Evelyn.

359
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:16,980
<13-7,VALENTINE>可临到头他却打电话来取消了
<13-7,VALENTINE>But Sid called last minute to cancel.

360
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,470
<13-8,CASTLE>你和希德要跟他前妻一起小聚
<13-8,CASTLE>You and Sid were going out with his ex-wife?

361
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:22,310
<13-9,VALENTINE>-这有点奇怪吧  -对我们来说不会
<13-9,VALENTINE>- Isn't that a little odd? - Not for us.

362
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:24,350
<13-9,VALENTINE>希德和伊芙琳二十年前就分开了
<13-9,VALENTINE>Sid and Evelyn split 20 years ago,

363
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:26,070
<13-9,VALENTINE>但我们仍是很要好的朋友
<13-9,VALENTINE>but we were all still close friends.

364
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:27,810
<13-10,BECKETT>他有说为什么要取消吗
<13-10,BECKETT>Did he say why he was canceling?

365
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,660
<13-11,VALENTINE>恐怕没有
<13-11,VALENTINE>Afraid not.

366
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:33,140
<13-12,CASTLE>他有提过半夜的什么交易吗
<13-12,CASTLE>Anything about a deal at midnight?

367
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,100
<13-13,VALENTINE>没有  但他要去个什么地方
<13-13,VALENTINE>No, but he was going somewhere,

368
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,760
<13-13,VALENTINE>因为他在讲电话时
<13-13,VALENTINE>Because while we were on the phone,

369
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:40,390
<13-13,VALENTINE>我亲眼看到他从大楼的私人出口离开了
<13-13,VALENTINE>I literally bumped into him leaving the building from the private entrance.

370
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,330
<13-14,CASTLE>等等  希德遇害当晚
<13-14,CASTLE>Wait, Sid was leaving the building

371
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:43,540
<13-14,CASTLE>离开了大楼
<13-14,CASTLE>the night of his murder?

372
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:46,700
<13-16,BECKETT>瓦伦汀先生  他有提过要跟谁见面吗
<13-16,BECKETT>Uh, Mr. Valentine, did he mention meeting with someone?

373
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:50,400
<13-16,BECKETT>拜托  叫我丹尼就好
<13-16,BECKETT>Please. Call me Danny.

374
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,850
<13-17,VALENTINE>没有  希德没说他要去哪
<13-17,VALENTINE>And, no, Sid didn't say where he was going.

375
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,530
<13-17,VALENTINE>但我确实看到一些奇怪的事
<13-17,VALENTINE>But I did see something strange.

376
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,490
<13-17,VALENTINE>他进了街角的地铁站
<13-17,VALENTINE>He went into the subway on the corner.

377
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,500
<13-18,CASTLE>那怎么奇怪了  丹尼
<13-18,CASTLE>And why was that strange, Danny?

378
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,300
<13-19,VALENTINE>他有24小时的私人司机
<13-19,VALENTINE>Well, he had an around-the-clock driver,

379
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,970
<13-19,VALENTINE>为什么要去搭乘公共交通工具呢
<13-19,VALENTINE>So why would he take mass transit?

380
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:10,810
<13-19,VALENTINE>除非是个秘密约会
<13-19,VALENTINE>Unless it was a secret rendezvous?

381
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,100
<14-1,BECKETT>不管希德去了哪
<14-1,BECKETT>Well, wherever Sid went,

382
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,700
<14-1,BECKETT>他显然不想让任何人知道
<14-1,BECKETT>He obviously didn't want anyone to know about it.

383
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,430
<14-1,BECKETT>拜托  卡塞尔
<14-1,BECKETT>Oh, come on, Castle.

384
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:25,330
<14-1,BECKETT>是他要跟我调情  我也没办法啊
<14-1,BECKETT>He was flirting with me. I can't control that.

385
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,680
<14-2,CASTLE>可你也回调他了
<14-2,CASTLE>But you were flirting right back.

386
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:27,960
<14-3,BECKETT>是  不然我该怎么做
<14-3,BECKETT>Yeah, but what was I supposed to do?

387
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,230
<14-3,BECKETT>他可是丹尼·瓦伦汀啊
<14-3,BECKETT>He's Danny frickin' Valentine.

388
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,610
<14-4,BECKETT>埃斯波
<14-4,BECKETT>Espo, hey.

389
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:34,490
<14-4,BECKETT>查到希德搭地铁去哪了吗
<14-4,BECKETT>You find out where Sid went on that subway ride?

390
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:37,360
<14-5,ESPOSITO>还没  但我跟他公司的基恩·沃格尔聊了
<14-5,ESPOSITO>Not yet, but I spoke to Gene Vogel from Sid's company.

391
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,940
<14-5,ESPOSITO>他所知的唯一一笔交易
<14-5,ESPOSITO>The only deal that he knew about was one

392
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,630
<14-5,ESPOSITO>是尚未经官方公布的
<14-5,ESPOSITO>that hasn't been officially announced yet.

393
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:41,830
<14-5,ESPOSITO>希德要把他公司49%的股份
<14-5,ESPOSITO>Apparently Sid was gonna sell

394
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:43,610
<14-5,ESPOSITO>卖给一家股权公司
<14-5,ESPOSITO>49% of his company to an equity firm.

395
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,280
<14-6,CASTLE>那会是希德提到的交易吗
<14-6,CASTLE>Could that be the deal sid was talking about?

396
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,100
<14-7,ESPOSITO>不太像  出售条款应该几周前就拟定了
<14-7,ESPOSITO>Doesn't look like it. The terms of the sale would have been settled weeks ago.

397
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,520
<14-7,ESPOSITO>没有什么可谈的了
<14-7,ESPOSITO>There was nothing left to negotiate.

398
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,360
<14-8,RYAN>各位  你们过来看看吧
<14-8,RYAN>Hey, guys, you're gonna wanna see this.

399
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:56,910
<15-1,RYAN>虽然希德用现金买的地铁卡
<15-1,RYAN>So, Sid paid for his metro card in cash,

400
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:59,760
<15-1,RYAN>不过我还是通过监控录像
<15-1,RYAN>but I was able to use security cams to track him

401
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,370
<15-1,RYAN>在大军团广场地铁站找到了他
<15-1,RYAN>all the way to Grand Army Plaza subway station.

402
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:04,530
<15-1,RYAN>他晚上十一点半在那下的车
<15-1,RYAN>He got off there at 11:30 P.M.

403
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,480
<15-2,BECKETT>布鲁克林  他去布鲁克林干什么
<15-2,BECKETT>In Brooklyn. What was he doing in Brooklyn?

404
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,720
<15-3,RYAN>我也有同样的问题
<15-3,RYAN>You know, I wondered the same thing,

405
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,850
<15-3,RYAN>所以我跟八十七分局核实了一下
<15-3,RYAN>so I checked with the 87th Precinct.

406
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:13,030
<15-3,RYAN>他们接到了一通从那个地方打来的报警电话
<15-3,RYAN>Apparently they responded to a 9-1-1 call in that area.

407
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,430
<15-4,ESPOSITO>-什么事  -自己看吧
<15-4,ESPOSITO>- About what? - Well, check it out.

408
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:16,760
<15-5,RYAN>警用交通录像
<15-5,RYAN>Officers used traffic cam footage,

409
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,460
<15-5,RYAN>拍到了事件结束时的画面
<15-5,RYAN>And they caught the tail end of it.

410
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:21,440
<15-5,RYAN>这里距离希德下地铁的地方大约有一个街区
<15-5,RYAN>This is about a block away from where Sid got off the subway.

411
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:23,510
<15-5,RYAN>看好了那个小巷子
<15-5,RYAN>Now keep your eye on that alley right there.

412
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:30,820
<15-6,ESPOSITO>-是打枪吗  -跟报警电话描述的吻合
<15-6,ESPOSITO>- Were those gunshots? - Fits with the 9-1-1 call.

413
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,410
<15-7,RYAN>报警者说有人开枪了
<15-7,RYAN>There was a report of shots fired.

414
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:34,260
<15-7,RYAN>看看接下来发生的
<15-7,RYAN>Now watch what happens next.

415
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:38,940
<15-7,RYAN>那是希德
<15-7,RYAN>That's Sid.

416
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,970
<15-8,BECKETT>各位  看一下时间戳
<15-8,BECKETT>You guys, look at the timestamp.

417
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:43,000
<15-8,BECKETT>刚过午夜十二点
<15-8,BECKETT>It's from just after midnight.

418
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,680
<15-9,CASTLE>这一定就是他所说的交易
<15-9,CASTLE>This must be the deal he was talking about.

419
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,510
<15-9,CASTLE>从他这个六十多岁人的移动速度来判断
<15-9,CASTLE>And judging by the speed his 60-year-old legs are moving,

420
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:49,160
<15-9,CASTLE>我觉得他一定是处于危险之中
<15-9,CASTLE>I would say he's in danger.

421
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,180
<15-10,BECKETT>那人是谁
<15-10,BECKETT>Who's that?

422
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,590
<15-11,RYAN>不知道  不过他手里有枪
<15-11,RYAN>I don't know, but he's got a gun

423
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:56,160
<15-11,RYAN>而且还戴着面具
<15-11,RYAN>and he's wearing a mask.

424
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,990
<15-12,CASTLE>不久之后  希德就从电梯井上栽下来了
<15-12,CASTLE>And hours later, Sid gets thrown down an elevator shaft.

425
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,640
<15-12,CASTLE>希德摊上什么事了
<15-12,CASTLE>What the hell was Sid mixed up in?

426
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,090
<16-1,BECKETT>各位  你们难道
<16-1,BECKETT>You guys, is it just me,

427
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:07,810
<16-1,BECKETT>不觉得这说不通吗
<16-1,BECKETT>or does none of this make sense?

428
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:09,550
<16-1,BECKETT>希德的财产有好几百万
<16-1,BECKETT>I mean, Sid was a multimillionaire.

429
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:12,530
<16-1,BECKETT>他这样的人绝不会在黑巷子里做见不得人的交易
<16-1,BECKETT>Guys like that don't make shady deals in the middle of dark alleys.

430
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:14,510
<16-2,RYAN>就算真要做  也会找别人替他做
<16-2,RYAN>Or if you do, you have someone else do it for you.

431
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:16,670
<16-3,ESPOSITO>是的  看看这个嫌犯
<16-3,ESPOSITO>Yeah, and take a look at our suspect there.

432
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:19,630
<16-3,ESPOSITO>是交易出了岔子  还是没杀死
<16-3,ESPOSITO>I mean, what is this, a deal gone wrong or a failed hit?

433
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:22,260
<16-4,CASTLE>是不是说  这个戴面具的人
<16-4,CASTLE>So what are we saying here, that the masked man

434
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,120
<16-4,CASTLE>跟踪希德回到了SNT大楼
<16-4,CASTLE>followed Sid back to the "S.N.T." building

435
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:24,960
<16-4,CASTLE>然后杀了他
<16-4,CASTLE>and killed him?

436
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,710
<16-5,ESPOSITO>既然有个没装监控的私人入口
<16-5,ESPOSITO>Well, with a private entrance with no surveillance cameras,

437
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:27,840
<16-5,ESPOSITO>这也是有可能的  对吧
<16-5,ESPOSITO>it's possible, right?

438
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,080
<16-6,CASTLE>可是既然有人要杀他
<16-6,CASTLE>But after an apparent attempt on his life,

439
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,950
<16-6,CASTLE>希德为什么还要回办公室呢
<16-6,CASTLE>why would Sid just go back to the office?

440
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:34,570
<16-7,BECKETT>而且如果希德真的有危险  他为什么不找保安呢
<16-7,BECKETT>And if Sid really was in danger, why didn't he call security?

441
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:36,580
<16-8,RYAN>我们或许能在那个小巷子里找到答案
<16-8,RYAN>Well, we may find some answers in that alley.

442
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:37,400
<16-9,ESPOSITO>我们去看看吧
<16-9,ESPOSITO>Let's go check it out.

443
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,350
<16-10,BECKETT>好的  卡塞尔和我再看一下交通录像
<16-10,BECKETT>Okay, Castle and I are gonna scrub traffic cams.

444
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,970
<16-10,BECKETT>或许能从中找出枪手
<16-10,BECKETT>Maybe we'll find the shooter there.

445
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:47,850
<17-1,RYAN>找到什么了吗
<17-1,RYAN>Anything yet?

446
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,340
<17-2,ESPOSITO>没有
<17-2,ESPOSITO>No.

447
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:53,170
<17-2,ESPOSITO>没有血迹  没有弹壳  什么都没有
<17-2,ESPOSITO>No blood, no shell casings, no nothing.

448
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:56,550
<17-3,RYAN>这有没有让你想起《夜晚周六夜》中的
<17-3,RYAN>Hey, doesn't this remind you of that sketch

449
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:59,690
<17-3,RYAN>麦基·弗兰克斯演夏洛克·福尔摩斯
<17-3,RYAN>from "Saturday Night Tonight" where, Mickey Franks

450
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:01,690
<17-3,RYAN>古怪的表弟的那个短剧
<17-3,RYAN>plays Sherlock Holmes' wacky cousin?

451
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:04,110
<17-4,ESPOSITO>没有  我不看那个无聊的节目
<17-4,ESPOSITO>No, I don't watch that stupid show, bro.

452
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:05,610
<17-1,RYAN>你不看
<17-1,RYAN>You don't?

453
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:06,660
<17-2,ESPOSITO>不看
<17-2,ESPOSITO>No.

454
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,930
<17-6,ESPOSITO>当然不看了  那些短剧从来没有结局
<17-6,ESPOSITO>Hell, no. The sketches never have any endings.

455
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:09,730
<17-6,ESPOSITO>简直是浪费时间
<17-6,ESPOSITO>It's a big waste of time,

456
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:11,160
<17-6,ESPOSITO>搜查这个巷子也是浪费时间
<17-6,ESPOSITO>Just like searching this alley is.

457
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,490
<17-7,RYAN>哈维  你得想个办法
<17-7,RYAN>You know, Javi, I think that you need

458
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:14,890
<17-7,RYAN>让自己阳光一些
<17-7,RYAN>to find a way to be more positive.

459
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:16,220
<17-8,ESPOSITO>不  我不需要
<17-8,ESPOSITO>No, I don't.

460
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,770
<17-9,RYAN>你也别总是说"不"了
<17-9,RYAN>And you need to stop saying "No" all the time.

461
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:22,060
<17-9,RYAN>其实  你为什么不能说"好的  而且..."
<17-9,RYAN>Instead, why don't you try saying "Yes, and..."?

462
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:23,650
<17-10,ESPOSITO>你说什么呢
<17-10,ESPOSITO>What the hell are you talking about?

463
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:26,530
<17-11,RYAN>这是我上大学时在即兴表演课上学的
<17-11,RYAN>Oh, I learned it in a "S.N.T." sponsored

464
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:28,930
<17-11,RYAN>那课程是SNT发起的
<17-11,RYAN>improvisation class I took in college.

465
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:31,850
<17-11,RYAN>你看  只需要把"不"换成"好的  而且"
<17-11,RYAN>See, by simply substituting "No" With "Yes, and..."

466
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:34,880
<17-11,RYAN>搭档们就不能打断彼此的进展
<17-11,RYAN>partners can't deny one another's progress

467
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,220
<17-11,RYAN>必须继续演下去  直至完成目标
<17-11,RYAN>moving forward in a scene and accomplishing goals.

468
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:41,940
<17-12,ESPOSITO>那个人或许昨天晚上也在这
<17-12,ESPOSITO>Yo. That guy might have been here last night.

469
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:45,200
<17-13,RYAN>是的  而且他可能还看到了
<17-13,RYAN>Yes, and he might have seen the exchange

470
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:46,600
<17-13,RYAN>希德和枪手之间的交易
<17-13,RYAN>between Sid and the gunman.

471
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,010
<17-13,RYAN>说了"好的[是]  而且"就会有收获吧
<17-13,RYAN>See what you can accomplish by saying "Yes, and..."?

472
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:51,790
<17-14,ESPOSITO>是的  而且你得闭嘴了
<17-14,ESPOSITO>Yes, and you need to shut the hell up.

473
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,790
<18-1,BECKETT>玛莎  你还好吗
<18-1,BECKETT>Martha, you okay?

474
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:05,330
<18-2,MARTHA>是的  是的  只是有点累了  没事的
<18-2,MARTHA>Oh, yeah. Yeah. Just a... little tired, that's all.

475
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,980
<18-3,CASTLE>走吧
<18-3,CASTLE>Shall we?

476
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,700
<18-4,BECKETT>你妈妈好像有点问题
<18-4,BECKETT>Something's wrong with your mom.

477
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,010
<18-5,CASTLE>我们不是已经谈过这事了吗
<18-5,CASTLE>I thought we already covered that.

478
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:13,720
<18-6,BECKETT>不是  不是  她不再重复台词了
<18-6,BECKETT>No, no, no. She's not repeating the lines.

479
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:15,350
<18-6,BECKETT>是有别的问题了
<18-6,BECKETT>Something else is going on.

480
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:18,310
<18-7,CASTLE>她不重复了不是更好吗
<18-7,CASTLE>Can't we just be happy that she stopped?

481
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:20,690
<18-8,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我得去警局了
<18-8,BECKETT>Castle, I have to go to the precinct.

482
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:22,830
<18-8,BECKETT>你能不能跟她谈谈  然后去警局找我
<18-8,BECKETT>Will you just talk to her and meet me over there?

483
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:25,050
<18-10,BECKETT>-可以  -好的  再见
<18-10,BECKETT>- Yeah. - OK. Bye.

489
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:38,550
<18-13,MARTHA>问得不对
<18-13,MARTHA>Wrong question.

490
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,120
<18-13,MARTHA>应该问我死了吗
<18-13,MARTHA>Am I dead?

508
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:22,150
<18-18,MARTHA>我拿到这个角色时  我就想
<18-18,MARTHA>When I got this part, I thought, well, hey,

509
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,170
<18-18,MARTHA>我有机会了
<18-18,MARTHA>there's a chance, you know?

510
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,840
<18-18,MARTHA>这可能是我演艺生涯的第二幕

<18-19,CASTLE>-的确是  -不  不是的

<18-20,MARTHA>I...

514
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:36,570
<18-20,MARTHA>我觉得我应该退出
<18-20,MARTHA>I think what I need to do is just drop out,

515
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:41,140
<18-20,MARTHA>-让我的替角登场  她很...  -绝对不行
<18-20,MARTHA>- let my understudy take over. She's very... - Oh, absolutely not.

<18-21,CASTLE>你不能退出  知道为什么吗
<18-21,CASTLE>You will not, and do you know why?

517
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:46,940
<18-21,CASTLE>因为你是个斗士  你怎么教育我的
<18-21,CASTLE>Because you're a fighter. What have you always told me?

518
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:50,210

<18-21,CASTLE>你要自己争取

<18-28,MARTHA>他死了吗

538
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,050
<18-29,CASTLE>给后面的观众再来一遍

<19-2,RYAN>他没有目击希德和蒙面枪手之间的"对话"
<19-2,RYAN>He didn't witness the exchange between Sid and our masked gunman.

544
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:48,760
<19-2,RYAN>但他的确听到了枪声
<19-2,RYAN>However, he did hear the gunshots

545
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,620
<19-2,RYAN>几分钟后看到一辆黑色探险者驶离现场
<19-2,RYAN>and a few minutes later he saw a black Explorer speeding away.

546
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:54,040
<19-3,BECKETT>-他看到车牌了吗  -是的  后四位
<19-3,BECKETT>- Did he get a plate? - Yeah, the last four numbers,

547
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,920
<19-4,RYAN>帮我们找到了一辆匹配的SUV
<19-4,RYAN>which got us a match to an SUV.

548
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,660
<19-4,RYAN>是这家伙租的...
<19-4,RYAN>rented by this guy --

549
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:00,390
<19-4,RYAN>科特·范·赞特
<19-4,RYAN>Kurt Van Zant.

<19-4,RYAN>因贩毒在福尔松监狱服了35年的刑
<19-4,RYAN>Just did a 35-year stretch in Folsom for drug trafficking,

551
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,260
<19-4,RYAN>但他刚被释放
<19-4,RYAN>but he was just released.

552
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,900
<19-5,BECKETT>希德和这前科犯有什么关联吗
<19-5,BECKETT>Is there a connection between Sid and this ex-con?

553
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,430
<19-6,RYAN>有的  范·赞特还在监狱里时
<19-6,RYAN>Oh, yeah. Uh, while he was in prison,

554
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:11,160
<19-6,RYAN>他向法院提起诉讼  声称是他为
<19-6,RYAN>Van Zant filed a lawsuit claiming that he financed

555
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:12,660
<19-6,RYAN>《今晚周六夜》首播集融资
<19-6,RYAN>the pilot for "Saturday Night Tonight"

556
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,590
<19-6,RYAN>而希德却让他一分好处没有捞到
<19-6,RYAN>and that Sid screwed him out of all the profits.

557
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:15,830
<19-7,BECKETT>等等  你是说
<19-7,BECKETT>Wait a minute. You're telling me

558
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:19,300
<19-7,BECKETT>毒枭给这个喜剧节目提供了资金支持
<19-7,BECKETT>that a drug kingpin bankrolled that comedy show?

559
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:19,780
<19-8,RYAN>没错
<19-8,RYAN>Yeah, I know.

560
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:21,500
<19-8,RYAN>听上去就像是他们的某个喜剧段子
<19-8,RYAN>It sounds like one of their comedy sketches, right?

561
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:24,290
<19-9,BECKETT>就是说这个给全国观众带去欢声笑语的节目
<19-9,BECKETT>So a show that brought joy, laughter, and "Judge Booty"

562
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:27,030
<19-9,BECKETT>可能是由贩毒的钱起家的
<19-9,BECKETT>to people everywhere may have been built on drug money.

563
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:28,430
<19-10,RYAN>是的  可诉讼被否
<19-10,RYAN>Yeah, but the lawsuit was thrown out,

564
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,990
<19-10,RYAN>希德数钞票时  范·赞特却在坐穿牢底
<19-10,RYAN>so while Sid was getting rich, Van Zant was rotting in prison.

565
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:33,050
<19-11,BECKETT>也许范·赞特就是希德跟他妻子说的
<19-11,BECKETT>You know, maybe Van Zant was who Sid was talking about

566
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:34,780
<19-11,BECKETT>那个要找他麻烦的人
<19-11,BECKETT>when he told his wife someone was after him.

567
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:36,330
<19-12,RYAN>有道理
<19-12,RYAN>Makes sense, right?

568
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:38,370
<19-12,RYAN>也许范·赞特觉得希德欠他
<19-12,RYAN>If Van Zant felt that Sid owed him a share

569
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:40,300
<19-12,RYAN>节目的利润  所以就来找他要了
<19-12,RYAN>of the profits from the show, maybe he came to collect.

570
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,990
<19-13,BECKETT>结果希德并没有乖乖给钱
<19-13,BECKETT>And when Sid didn't want to go along,

571
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:44,560
<19-13,BECKETT>范·赞特就选择了复仇
<19-13,BECKETT>Van Zant opted for revenge instead.

572
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:45,820
<19-13,BECKETT>范·赞特现在在哪里
<19-13,BECKETT>Where is Van Zant now?

573
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:47,670
<19-14,RYAN>他在皇后区的一家旅店登记入住了
<19-14,RYAN>He's registered at a hotel up in Queens.

574
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:51,610
<19-15,ESPOSITO>我把范·赞特的照片给SNT的保安看了
<19-15,ESPOSITO>Yo. I sent Van Zant's photo to security at "S.N.T.",

575
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:53,010
<19-15,ESPOSITO>问有没有人昨晚看到过他
<19-15,ESPOSITO>asked if anybody saw him last night.

576
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:55,070
<19-15,ESPOSITO>没人看到  但30分钟之前
<19-15,ESPOSITO>No one did. However, 30 minutes ago,

577
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:56,400
<19-15,ESPOSITO>范·赞特进入了大楼
<19-15,ESPOSITO>Van Zant entered the building

578
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,450
<19-15,ESPOSITO>是剧组里的某人给了他通行证
<19-15,ESPOSITO>on a day pass called in from someone at the show.

579
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:02,840
<20-1,VOGEL>科特·范·赞特  不是说真的吧
<20-1,VOGEL>Kurt Van Zant? You got to be kidding me.

580
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,130
<20-2,BECKETT>你认识他吗
<20-2,BECKETT>Yeah. Do you know him?

581
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:06,450
<20-3,VOGEL>不  不过希德跟我讲过他很多事
<20-3,VOGEL>No, but Sid told me all about him.

582
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,590
<20-3,VOGEL>他可是个危险人物
<20-3,VOGEL>He's dangerous.

583
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:09,760
<20-3,VOGEL>你是说他现在在演播室里
<20-3,VOGEL>You're telling me he's here in the studio?

584
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:11,510
<20-4,CASTLE>你知道是谁给他弄的通行证吗
<20-4,CASTLE>Do you know who called in his pass?

585
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,090
<20-5,VOGEL>不  不过我能查到
<20-5,VOGEL>No, but I can find out.

586
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:14,980
<20-5,VOGEL>跟我来
<20-5,VOGEL>Follow me.

587
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:24,880
<20-6,BECKETT>有什么事情吗
<20-6,BECKETT>Um, um, can I help you?

588
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:26,210
<20-7,TINA>不  没事
<20-7,TINA>Oh, no, it's fine.

589
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:28,520
<20-7,TINA>只是你的步态非常奇特
<20-7,TINA>You just have a very bizarre gait.

590
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,670
<20-9,TINA>抱...抱歉  什么
<20-9,TINA>I'm -- I'm sorry, what?

591
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:31,600
<20-9,TINA>抱歉  什么
<20-9,TINA>I'm sorry, what?

592
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:32,930
<20-9,TINA>搞定
<20-9,TINA>Nailed it.

593
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,340
<20-10,BECKETT>卡塞尔  告诉我我不是那样子的
<20-10,BECKETT>Castle, please tell me I don't move like that.

594
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:41,580
<20-10,BECKETT>我是那样的吗
<20-10,BECKETT>I mean...do I?

595
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:46,100
<20-11,CASTLE>这是陷阱问题吗
<20-11,CASTLE>Is this a trick question?

596
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:48,500
<20-11,CASTLE>哪个答案不会让我今晚睡在沙发上
<20-11,CASTLE>What answer is not gonna have me sleeping on the couch tonight?

597
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:56,840
<20-12,VOGEL>查德  找出是谁给科特·范·赞特发的通行证
<20-12,VOGEL>Chad, find out who called in a day pass for a Kurt Van Zant.

598
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,300
<20-13,CHAD>就站在你眼前  先生
<20-13,CHAD>You're looking at him, sir.

599
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:01,230
<20-14,BECKETT>什么  是你发的通行证  为什么
<20-14,BECKETT>Wait a minute. You called in the pass? Why?

600
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:03,570
<20-15,CHAD>是瓦伦汀先生让我发的
<20-15,CHAD>I was told to by Mr. Valentine.

601
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,170

<20-15,CHAD>- Danny Valentine? - Danny Valentine!

602
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:08,970
<21-1,CASTLE>我就知道
<21-1,CASTLE>Oh, I knew it.

603
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:11,120
<21-1,CASTLE>那个混蛋  毫无才华的花花公子...
<21-1,CASTLE>That smug, no-talent playboy --

604
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,850
<21-1,CASTLE>他就是这一切的幕后黑手
<21-1,CASTLE>He's up to his neck in this!

<21-2,VALENTINE>- Wait, no! Help! - N.Y.P.D.!

<22-1,VALENTINE>救命
<22-1,VALENTINE>Help! Aah!

609
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,140
<22-2,CASTLE>放开他[让他掉下去]
<22-2,CASTLE>Let him go!

610
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:24,420
<22-3,VALENTINE>什么  不
<22-3,VALENTINE>What?! No!

611
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:29,240
<22-3,VALENTINE>把他拉进来  范·赞特  马上
<22-3,VALENTINE>Pull him in, Van Zant, now!

612
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,360
<23-1,BECKETT>女士  别激动
<23-1,BECKETT>Hey, lady, relax!

613
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:35,170
<23-2,KURT VAN ZANT>让我看到你的双手
<23-2,KURT VAN ZANT>Come on, let me see your hands.

614
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:40,960
<23-3,BECKETT>多谢
<23-3,BECKETT>Thanks.

615
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,750
<23-4,VALENTINE>这家伙是个疯子
<23-4,VALENTINE>Guy's a psychopath.

616
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:44,650
<23-5,CASTLE>那你为什么要给他通行证
<23-5,CASTLE>Then why did you give him a pass to get on?

617
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,090
<23-6,VALENTINE>他在我酒店留了张字条
<23-6,VALENTINE>He left a note at my hotel.

618
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:48,260
<23-6,VALENTINE>说是有关于希德被害的信息
<23-6,VALENTINE>He said he had information about Sid's murder.

619
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,460
<23-7,BECKETT>你是说你并不认识这个人吗
<23-7,BECKETT>Are you saying you don't know this man?

620
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:50,740
<23-8,VALENTINE>我今天之前都没见过他
<23-8,VALENTINE>I never him before today.

621
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:53,400
<23-9,VAN ZANT>这整件事是个天大的误会
<23-9,VAN ZANT>Listen, this whole thing is a big misunderstanding.

622
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,230
<23-10,BECKETT>肯定是  走
<23-10,BECKETT>I'm sure it is. Come on.

623
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:59,410
<23-11,CASTLE>关于希德被害  他到底知道些什么
<23-11,CASTLE>So what information did he have about Sid's murder?

624
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:01,520
<23-11,CASTLE>什么都没有  他就是来要钱的
<23-11,CASTLE>Nothing. I mean, this was a shakedown.

625
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:04,150
<23-12,VALENTINE>他声称希德欠他《今晚周六夜》的钱
<23-12,VALENTINE>He claimed Sid owed him money for "Saturday Night Tonight",

626
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:05,280
<23-12,VALENTINE>鉴于希德没给他钱  他就想让我
<23-12,VALENTINE>but since Sid didn't pay, he wanted me

627
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:07,060
<23-12,VALENTINE>把我的那份转让给他
<23-12,VALENTINE>to sign over my shares of the show.

628
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:10,460
<23-13,CASTLE>-你也有节目的股份  -5%
<23-13,CASTLE>- You own a piece of the show? - Mm, 5%.

629
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,830
<23-14,VALENTINE>希德需要一个名人上首播集
<23-14,VALENTINE>Sid needed a -- a celebrity get for the pilot,

630
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:15,560
<23-14,VALENTINE>所以他就分了我一部分
<23-14,VALENTINE>so he gave me a piece of the back end.

631
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,440
<23-14,VALENTINE>这是我一生最棒的交易
<23-14,VALENTINE>It was the deal of my life.

632
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:20,010
<23-15,CASTLE>范·赞特想要他的那一份  但希德死了
<23-15,CASTLE>So Van Zant wanted his cut, but with Sid dead,

633
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:21,750
<23-15,CASTLE>他唯一的选择是来找你要
<23-15,CASTLE>his only option was to come after yours.

634
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:22,470
<23-16,VALENTINE>我拒绝了
<23-16,VALENTINE>I refused.

635
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:24,100
<23-16,VALENTINE>我说"这就是演艺圈  伙计"
<23-16,VALENTINE>I-I said, "Hey, that's show business, baby",

636
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,140
<23-16,VALENTINE>他听后就开始把我往窗户外面推
<23-16,VALENTINE>but that's when he started shoving me out the window.

637
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,250
<24-1,BECKETT>在福尔松蹲了35年
<24-1,BECKETT>35 years in Folsom.

638
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:32,990
<24-1,BECKETT>范·赞特先生  怨恨这么久还没消
<24-1,BECKETT>That's a long time to hold a grudge, Mr. Van Zant.

639
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:35,500
<24-2,VAN ZANT>女士  我没有杀希德
<24-2,VAN ZANT>Lady, I didn't kill Sid.

640
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:39,320
<24-3,BECKETT>可你却被看到逃离发生枪击的小巷
<24-3,BECKETT>And yet you were seen fleeing the alley where those shots were fired.

641
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:42,490
<24-3,BECKETT>不难想象  你会跟踪希德
<24-3,BECKETT>It's not hard to imagine that you would follow Sid

642
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:43,970
<24-3,BECKETT>然后把他结果掉
<24-3,BECKETT>and finish off the job.

643
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:47,000
<24-4,VAN ZANT>听着  你全都弄错了
<24-4,VAN ZANT>Look. You got this all wrong!

644
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,910
<24-4,VAN ZANT>假释出来之后  我直接去找了希德
<24-4,VAN ZANT>When I got paroled, I went straight to Sid.

645
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:51,980
<24-4,VAN ZANT>我们都谈妥了  他也道歉了
<24-4,VAN ZANT>We had it out, and he apologized.

646
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:53,710
<24-5,BECKETT>结果他现在却死了
<24-5,BECKETT>Except now he's dead.

647
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:55,040
<24-6,VAN ZANT>我为什么要对他下手呢
<24-6,VAN ZANT>Why would I move on him?

648
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,530
<24-6,VAN ZANT>他答应在把股份卖给资本集团之后
<24-6,VAN ZANT>He agreed to give me a major chunk of change

649
00:25:57,530 --> 00:26:00,690
<24-6,VAN ZANT>分给我其中很大的一份
<24-6,VAN ZANT>of an upcoming sale of shares to some equity group.

650
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:01,700
<24-6,VAN ZANT>所以我们没事了
<24-6,VAN ZANT>So we were good.

651
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:04,040
<24-7,BECKETT>那并不能解释你在巷子里朝他开枪
<24-7,BECKETT>That doesn't square with you shooting at him in the alley.

652
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:05,900
<24-8,VAN ZANT>那不是我  我发誓
<24-8,VAN ZANT>That wasn't me. I swear!

653
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:09,240
<24-9,BECKETT>如果不是  那是谁
<24-9,BECKETT>If it wasn't you, then who was it?

654
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,510
<24-9,BECKETT>我不知道
<24-9,BECKETT>I don't know.

655
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:13,100
<24-10,VAN ZANT>希德打电话给我
<24-10,VAN ZANT>Sid called me and told me

656
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,530
<24-10,VAN ZANT>说转让给我的节目股份文件准备好了
<24-10,VAN ZANT>the paperwork for my stake in the show was ready.

657
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:17,630
<24-10,VAN ZANT>但他不肯签字
<24-10,VAN ZANT>But he wouldn't sign off

658
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,370
<24-10,VAN ZANT>除非我先给他一样东西
<24-10,VAN ZANT>unless I brought him something.

659
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,610
<24-10,VAN ZANT>好吧
<24-10,VAN ZANT>Okay, fine.

660
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:22,980
<24-11,BECKETT>我就陪你玩
<24-11,BECKETT>I'll play along.

661
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:26,690
<24-11,BECKETT>希德让你给他带什么
<24-11,BECKETT>What did Sid want you to bring?

662
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:29,600
<24-12,VAN ZANT>一把未注册的枪
<24-12,VAN ZANT>An unregistered gun.

663
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:31,380
<24-13,BECKETT>希德要枪干什么
<24-13,BECKETT>Why would Sid want a gun?

664
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,880
<24-13,BECKETT>等等  让我猜猜  他没告诉你吧
<24-13,BECKETT>Wait, no. Let me guess. He didn't tell you.

665
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:34,900
<24-14,VAN ZANT>他真的没告诉我
<24-14,VAN ZANT>It's true!

666
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,280
<24-14,VAN ZANT>他只说让我11点半在那个小巷等他
<24-14,VAN ZANT>He just told me to meet him near that alley

667
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,780
<24-14,VAN ZANT>我就去了
<24-14,VAN ZANT>11:30, so I did.

668
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,870
<24-14,VAN ZANT>我给了他一把点38手枪
<24-14,VAN ZANT>I gave him a .38 special,

669
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:42,300
<24-14,VAN ZANT>他跟我说我今天早上
<24-14,VAN ZANT>and he told me I could pick up

670
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,600
<24-14,VAN ZANT>就可以去取签好字的文件了
<24-14,VAN ZANT>the signed papers in the morning.

671
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:46,500
<24-14,VAN ZANT>然后他让我远走高飞
<24-14,VAN ZANT>And then he told me I should take a hike.

672
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,210
<24-15,BECKETT>但你没这么做
<24-15,BECKETT>But you didn't.

673
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:49,940
<24-16,VAN ZANT>他要了一把枪
<24-16,VAN ZANT>Well... a man asks for a gun,

674
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,860
<24-16,VAN ZANT>他这是要趟浑水
<24-16,VAN ZANT>he's looking to dance with danger.

675
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:54,450
<24-16,VAN ZANT>我觉得我应该保护我的投资
<24-16,VAN ZANT>I thought it wise to protect my investment.

676
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:56,310
<24-17,BECKETT>你是说你留在那
<24-17,BECKETT>So you're saying that you stuck around

677
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:58,750
<24-17,BECKETT>-就为了看会发生什么事  -是的
<24-17,BECKETT>- just to see what would happen. - Yep.

678
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:01,780
<24-18,VAN ZANT>我看到希德穿过小巷躲进了一个门廊
<24-18,VAN ZANT>Saw Sid go down the alley and hide in a doorway.

679
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,230
<24-18,VAN ZANT>20分钟过去
<24-18,VAN ZANT>20 minutes go by,

680
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:05,590
<24-18,VAN ZANT>一个带面具的人出现了
<24-18,VAN ZANT>and some dude in a mask shows up.

681
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:08,590
<24-18,VAN ZANT>打开垃圾箱拿出一个绿色背包
<24-18,VAN ZANT>Opens the dumpster, pulls out a green duffel bag.

682
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:10,420
<24-19,BECKETT>背包里是什么
<24-19,BECKETT>And what was in the duffel bag?

683
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,350
<24-20,VAN ZANT>我怎么知道
<24-20,VAN ZANT>Hell if I know.

684
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:14,420
<24-20,VAN ZANT>这时希德拿着枪跳了出来  大声叫着
<24-20,VAN ZANT>But that's when Sid jumps out with the gun, screaming,

685
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:17,460
<24-20,VAN ZANT>你要的已经给你了  她在哪
<24-20,VAN ZANT>"You got what you wanted! Now where is she?"

686
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,110
<24-21,BECKETT>她是谁
<24-21,BECKETT>Who is "She"?

687
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:20,230
<24-21,BECKETT>我不知道
<24-21,BECKETT>I have no idea.

688
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,580
<24-22,VAN ZANT>但那个戴面具的人制住了希德
<24-22,VAN ZANT>But the masked man got the drop on Sid.

689
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:25,400
<24-22,VAN ZANT>他们扭打着去抢枪  然后砰砰砰
<24-22,VAN ZANT>They wrestled for the gun, and then, pop, pop, pop!

690
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,060
<24-22,VAN ZANT>枪响了
<24-22,VAN ZANT>Shots go off in the air!

691
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,670
<24-23,BECKETT>如果你想保护你的投资
<24-23,BECKETT>You know what? If you were protecting your investment,

692
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:31,120
<24-23,BECKETT>那你为什么没帮他
<24-23,BECKETT>then why didn't you help him out?

693
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:32,660
<24-24,VAN ZANT>希德跑了呀
<24-24,VAN ZANT>Well, Sid ran off.

694
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:34,660
<24-24,VAN ZANT>那个戴面具的人也没追他
<24-24,VAN ZANT>And the guy in the mask wasn't giving chase,

695
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:37,010
<24-24,VAN ZANT>所以我想  我还在假释期呢
<24-24,VAN ZANT>So I figured, well, I'm on parole.

696
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:39,560
<24-24,VAN ZANT>得在警察来之前赶紧跑
<24-24,VAN ZANT>I need to bug out before the cops show up.

697
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:41,570
<24-25,BECKETT>你这是旁观
<24-25,BECKETT>And that's all you did?

698
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:43,980
<24-26,VAN ZANT>我开车去了希德家看看能不能截住他
<24-26,VAN ZANT>I drove to Sid's building to see if I could catch him

699
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:45,940
<24-26,VAN ZANT>质问他到底把我卷进了什么事
<24-26,VAN ZANT>and ask him what the hell he got me into.

700
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,750
<24-26,VAN ZANT>但他一直没出现
<24-26,VAN ZANT>But he never showed up.

701
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:50,220
<24-26,VAN ZANT>紧接着  我就听说他死了
<24-26,VAN ZANT>Next thing I know, he's dead.

702
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,180
<25-1,ESPOSITO>我觉得他说的是实话
<25-1,ESPOSITO>I think he's telling the truth.

703
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,850
<25-1,ESPOSITO>希德公寓外的监控录像
<25-1,ESPOSITO>Security video outside of Sid's apartment

704
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,790
<25-1,ESPOSITO>拍到范·赞特在他车里
<25-1,ESPOSITO>shows Van Zant waiting out front

705
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:58,590
<25-1,ESPOSITO>从12点30到凌晨3点30一直等在那
<25-1,ESPOSITO>in his car from 12:30 A.M. to 3:30 in the morning.

706
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:00,560
<25-2,BECKETT>那里和摄影棚离得远着呢
<25-2,BECKETT>That's on the other side of town from the studio.

707
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,770
<25-3,ESPOSITO>范·赞特不可能作案
<25-3,ESPOSITO>Yeah, Van Zant couldn't have done it.

708
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:03,780
<25-4,BECKETT>你搜查的那个垃圾箱
<25-4,BECKETT>Okay, that dumpster that you searched --

709
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:05,010
<25-4,BECKETT>里面有背包吗
<25-4,BECKETT>There was no duffel bag?

710
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:06,430
<25-5,ESPOSITO>戴面具的人拿走了包
<25-5,ESPOSITO>The guy in the mask must have taken it,

711
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:08,060
<25-5,ESPOSITO>说明那个包是希德
<25-5,ESPOSITO>which means that Sid must have been the guy

712
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:08,930
<25-5,ESPOSITO>放那里的
<25-5,ESPOSITO>who dropped it off.

713
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:10,800
<25-6,BECKETT>希德说的交易肯定是指这个
<25-6,BECKETT>This has to be the deal that Sid was talking about,

714
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,510
<25-6,BECKETT>那个背包装的是赎金
<25-6,BECKETT>and that duffel bag was the payoff.

715
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:13,670
<25-7,RYAN>绝对没错
<25-7,RYAN>Yeah, it sure was.

716
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:15,350
<25-7,RYAN>我和业务经理谈了
<25-7,RYAN>I spoke with the business manager.

717
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:17,880
<25-7,RYAN>他刚发现在他被杀当天
<25-7,RYAN>He just discovered that on the day he was murdered,

718
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:20,420
<25-7,RYAN>-希德取了一大笔钱  -多少
<25-7,RYAN>- Sid made a huge bank withdrawal. - How huge?

719
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:22,350
<25-9,RYAN>400万无序美钞
<25-9,RYAN>$4 million in nonsequential bills.

720
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:23,550
<25-9,RYAN>无序美钞
<25-9,RYAN>Nonsequential bills?

721
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:25,260
<25-10,BECKETT>各位  这是起出岔的绑架案
<25-10,BECKETT>You guys, this was a ransom gone wrong.

722
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,480
<25-10,BECKETT>所以希德才会问  她在哪
<25-10,BECKETT>That's why Sid asked, "Where is she?"

723
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:30,160
<25-10,BECKETT>-他认识的某个女人被绑架了  -谁呢
<25-10,BECKETT>- Some woman is his life was kidnapped. - Yeah, but who?

724
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,530
<25-11,ESPOSITO>那就是我们要查出的
<25-11,ESPOSITO>That's what we got to find out.

725
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:33,900
<25-12,BECKETT>因为绑架她的人很可能就是凶手
<25-12,BECKETT>'cause whoever took her might be our killer.

726
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,770
<26-1,BECKETT>《今晚周六夜》的演员和工作人员
<26-1,BECKETT>The cast and the crew of "Saturday night tonight"

727
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:39,800
<26-1,BECKETT>都在摄影棚
<26-1,BECKETT>are all at the studio.

728
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,420
<26-1,BECKETT>无人失踪
<26-1,BECKETT>No one is missing.

729
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:43,540
<26-2,CASTLE>我们找到了希德的妻子  家人
<26-2,CASTLE>So we've covered Sid's wife, his family,

730
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:45,090
<26-2,CASTLE>朋友  同事
<26-2,CASTLE>his friends, and now his job.

731
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:46,420
<26-2,CASTLE>大家都没事
<26-2,CASTLE>Everyone's accounted for.

732
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:48,310
<26-3,RYAN>事实上  不是所有人
<26-3,RYAN>Uh, actually, not everyone.

733
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:50,820
<26-3,RYAN>伊芙琳·罗斯  希德的第一任妻子
<26-3,RYAN>Evelyn Ross, Sid's first wife.

734
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:51,720
<26-4,BECKETT>她失踪了吗
<26-4,BECKETT>She's missing?

735
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,180
<26-5,RYAN>我询问了希德的儿子
<26-5,RYAN>Well, I followed up with Sid's son,

736
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,740
<26-5,RYAN>他说她一直没回电话
<26-5,RYAN>and he said that she hadn't returned

737
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:57,440
<26-5,RYAN>所以我去问了她的门卫
<26-5,RYAN>any of his phone calls, so I spoke with her doorman.

738
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,740
<26-5,RYAN>门卫说伊芙琳两天前去晨跑后
<26-5,RYAN>Said that Evelyn went on her usual 6:00 A.M. run

739
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,630
<26-5,RYAN>就再也没回来
<26-5,RYAN>two days ago, and he hasn't seen her since.

740
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:02,800
<26-5,RYAN>她肯定就是被绑者
<26-5,RYAN>She's got to be our kidnap vic.

741
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,680
<26-6,ESPOSITO>没错  而且我定位了她的手机
<26-6,ESPOSITO>Yes, and I was able to ping her cell phone.

742
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,630
<26-8,ESPOSITO>-没错而且  -我没有
<26-8,ESPOSITO>- "Yes, and..." - I wasn't doing that.

743
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:08,500
<26-9,RYAN>-你刚说完  -警员发现手机
<26-9,RYAN>- No, you did it just now. - Anyway, uniforms found the phone

744
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,750
<26-10,ESPOSITO>被扔在布朗克斯一家酒馆旁的垃圾箱
<26-10,ESPOSITO>dumped in a trash can near a bodega in the Bronx,

745
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,650
<26-10,ESPOSITO>很可能是绑架者扔的
<26-10,ESPOSITO>probably tossed there by her kidnapper.

746
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:14,020
<26-11,BECKETT>有点不对劲
<26-11,BECKETT>Somethins not right here.

747
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,710
<26-12,CASTLE>首先被害人的行为就不对劲
<26-12,CASTLE>Starting with our victim's behavior.

748
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:17,780
<26-12,CASTLE>假设你是希德  你前妻被绑架了
<26-12,CASTLE>You're Sid. Your ex-wife gets kidnapped.

749
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,770
<26-12,CASTLE>在小巷中救回她的计划也失败了
<26-12,CASTLE>The deal in the alley to get her back goes south.

750
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:21,760
<26-12,CASTLE>这种情况下  你为什么还不找警察
<26-12,CASTLE>At that point, why wouldn't you go to the police?

751
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,070
<26-12,CASTLE>为什么要回你的办公室去
<26-12,CASTLE>Why do you go back to your office?

752
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:25,160
<26-13,RYAN>我再去趟希德的办公室  看有什么发现
<26-13,RYAN>I'll circle back with Sid's office, see what I can find out.

753
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,800
<26-14,ESPOSITO>警员刚送来了伊芙琳的手机
<26-14,ESPOSITO>Yo, unis just arrived with Evelyn's phone.

754
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,290
<27-1,TECH>这是伊芙琳的云账户
<27-1,TECH>This is Evelyn's cloud account.

755
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:31,740
<27-1,TECH>和她的手机是同步的
<27-1,TECH>It's synched to her cell phone.

756
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,980
<27-2,BECKETT>跑步地图  是那个健身应用
<27-2,BECKETT>Map My Jog. That's a fitness app.

757
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,010
<27-2,BECKETT>打开好吗
<27-2,BECKETT>Can you click on it?

758
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:36,790
<27-4,ESPOSITO>看来一直在运行
<27-4,ESPOSITO>Looks like it's been running this whole time.

759
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:38,710
<27-5,BECKETT>我见过这款应用
<27-5,BECKETT>I've seen this app before.

760
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:40,300
<27-5,BECKETT>用卫星定位系统计算
<27-5,BECKETT>They use G.P.S. to calculate

761
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,090
<27-5,BECKETT>跑步者的跑步距离和速度
<27-5,BECKETT>a jogger's distance and pace

762
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:43,890
<27-5,BECKETT>最重要的是还有跑步路线
<27-5,BECKETT>and most importantly, their route.

763
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,860
<27-6,ESPOSITO>重播一次伊芙琳的最后一次跑步路线好吗
<27-6,ESPOSITO>Can you replay Evelyn's last path?

764
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:49,040
<27-7,ESPOSITO>这是她离开了公寓
<27-7,ESPOSITO>That's her leaving her building.

765
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:52,290
<27-8,BECKETT>她跑向了公园
<27-8,BECKETT>Okay, so she jogged to the park.

766
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:54,750
<27-9,ESPOSITO>等等  这是她被绑架的时候吧
<27-9,ESPOSITO>Wait. Is this when she got kidnapped?

767
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:56,750
<27-10,BECKETT>肯定是  她的速度是每小时30英里
<27-10,BECKETT>It's got to be. She's moving at 30 miles an hour.

768
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:58,430
<27-11,ESPOSITO>-她肯定在车上  -没错
<27-11,ESPOSITO>- She had to have been in a vehicle. - Yeah.

769
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:01,420
<27-12,BECKETT>可以快进一下看看终点在哪里吗
<27-12,BECKETT>Can you fast-forward so that we can see where she ended up?

770
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:04,340
<27-13,TECH>她被带去了布朗克斯区
<27-13,TECH>So she was taken up to the Bronx.

771
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:09,730
<27-14,ESPOSITO>看来她停在了这座建筑物里
<27-14,ESPOSITO>Okay, looks like she stopped at this building.

772
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:12,270
<27-15,BECKETT>伊芙琳可能还在里面
<27-15,BECKETT>Evelyn might still be in that building.

773
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:13,550
<27-17,BECKETT>那是什么地方
<27-17,BECKETT>What do we know about that place?

774
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,970
<27-18,ESPOSITO>-不知道  我们去查  -好的
<27-18,ESPOSITO>- I don't know. We'll find out. - Okay.

775
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,750
<27-19,BECKETT>莱恩  希德的办公室有发现吗
<27-19,BECKETT>Hey, Ryan, you find anything in Sid's office?

776
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:21,250
<27-20,RYAN>没有  只有些文件和表格
<27-20,RYAN>No, just paperwork and spreadsheets.

777
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:23,500
<27-21,BECKETT>没什么和绑架有关的吗
<27-21,BECKETT>So nothing that speaks to a possible kidnapping?

778
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,690
<27-22,RYAN>都是很直白的东西  但我会带回来
<27-22,RYAN>Pretty straightforward stuff, but I'll bring it in

779
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,540
<27-22,RYAN>我们再细细梳理一遍
<27-22,RYAN>so we can go through it with a fine-tooth comb.

780
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:29,600
<27-23,ESPOSITO>贝克特  有发现
<27-23,ESPOSITO>Beckett, we got something.

781
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,230
<27-24,BECKETT>莱恩  我得挂了
<27-24,BECKETT>Okay, Ryan, I got to go.

782
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,800
<27-25,ESPOSITO>伊芙琳被带去的建筑
<27-25,ESPOSITO>That building where Evelyn was taken

783
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,140
<27-25,ESPOSITO>是个废弃仓库
<27-25,ESPOSITO>is an abandoned warehouse.

784
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:36,360
<27-25,ESPOSITO>这是个藏人质的最佳地点
<27-25,ESPOSITO>It's the ideal location to hold someone hostage.

785
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,950
<27-25,ESPOSITO>纽约警局
<27-25,ESPOSITO>N.Y.P.D.!

786
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:40,620
<28-1,SWAT TEAM MEMBER>上  上  上
<28-1,SWAT TEAM MEMBER>Go, go, go!

<28-3,ESPOSITO>Over here! Kick it.

789
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:52,810
<28-3,ESPOSITO>伊芙琳
<28-3,ESPOSITO>Evelyn?

790
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:55,420
<28-4,ESPOSITO>我们是警察  你现在安全了
<28-4,ESPOSITO>We're the police. You're safe now.

791
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:58,870
<28-5,EVELYN ROSS>天呐
<28-5,EVELYN ROSS>Oh, god...

792
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,340
<29-1,EVELYN>我只是停下来伸展一下
<29-1,EVELYN>I just had stopped to stretch,

793
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:06,420
<29-1,EVELYN>下一秒  就有一块破布
<29-1,EVELYN>and the next thing I knew, there was a rag

794
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:07,660
<29-1,EVELYN>捂住了我的嘴巴  然后
<29-1,EVELYN>over my mouth, and...

795
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:12,270
<29-1,EVELYN>我再醒来时  就在仓库里了
<29-1,EVELYN>Uh, when I came to, I was in that warehouse.

796
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:15,960
<29-2,CASTLE>有没有哪个时刻  你看见了
<29-2,CASTLE>At any point in time, did you get a look

797
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,640
<29-2,CASTLE>绑架者的脸
<29-2,CASTLE>at your kidnapper's face?

798
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,770
<29-3,EVELYN>他一直带着面具
<29-3,EVELYN>He always wore a mask.

799
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,080
<29-3,EVELYN>像是个滑雪面具  但很有光泽
<29-3,EVELYN>It was like a ski mask, but shiny,

800
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:25,820
<29-3,EVELYN>中间有道银色的锯齿
<29-3,EVELYN>with a silver zigzag up the middle

801
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:28,690
<29-4,CASTLE>还有个金色的头饰带
<29-4,CASTLE>and...a gold headband.

802
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:31,050
<29-4,CASTLE>金色的头饰带  你确定吗
<29-4,CASTLE>A gold headband? Are you sure about that?

803
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:32,890
<29-5,EVELYN>我很确定那就是个头饰带
<29-5,EVELYN>I'm pretty sure that's what it was.

804
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:35,610
<29-6,BECKETT>他的衣着呢
<29-6,BECKETT>And, uh, how about his clothes?

805
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:37,550
<29-6,BECKETT>你记得他的衣着有什么特别的吗
<29-6,BECKETT>Do you remember anything distinctive about them?

806
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:39,650
<29-6,BECKETT>不记得
<29-6,BECKETT>No.

807
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:43,290
<29-7,EVELYN>但是  他戴着戒指
<29-7,EVELYN>But...he wore a ring.

808
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:48,460
<29-7,EVELYN>他右手上戴着一枚红银相间的图章戒指
<29-7,EVELYN>A red and silver signet ring on his right hand.

809
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:49,590
<29-7,EVELYN>我记得
<29-7,EVELYN>I remember that.

810
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:51,120
<29-8,CASTLE>伊芙琳  再回到面具
<29-8,CASTLE>Evelyn, back to the mask --

811
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,450
<29-8,CASTLE>它跟这个面具相似吗
<29-8,CASTLE>did it look anything like this?

812
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,960
<29-9,EVELYN>是的  一模一样
<29-9,EVELYN>Yes, exactly like that.

813
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,430
<29-10,BECKETT>这是《今晚周六夜》节目里的吗
<29-10,BECKETT>Is that from "Saturday Night Tonight"?

814
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:01,660
<29-11,CASTLE>这个出自他们两年前一个不怎么出名的段子
<29-11,CASTLE>It's from an obscure sketch they did two years ago

815
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:03,870
<29-11,CASTLE>名叫《墨西哥摔角早茶自助》
<29-11,CASTLE>called "Lucha Libre Brunch Buffet."

816
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:05,420
<29-12,BECKETT>就是说绑架者可以进入
<29-12,BECKETT>So our kidnapper had access

817
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:07,730
<29-12,BECKETT>演播室的道具服装室
<29-12,BECKETT>to the props and wardrobe room at the studio.

818
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:09,050
<29-13,CASTLE>这是监守自盗
<29-13,CASTLE>This was an inside job.

819
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:12,170
<29-13,CASTLE>香蕉三明治  怎么个意思
<29-13,CASTLE>What do you mean, a banana sandwich?

833
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,890
<31-1,BECKETT>有人最近借了这些面具中的一个
<31-1,BECKETT>Someone recently checked out one of these masks,

834
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:43,800
<31-1,BECKETT>-我们得知道是谁  -现在吗
<31-1,BECKETT>- and we need to know who. - Now?

00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,090
<31-2,PROPMASTER>我们正在直播

00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:47,600
<31-3,CASTLE>它在《墨西哥摔角早茶自助》里用过
<31-3,CASTLE>It was from the "Lucha Libre Brunch Buffet" sketch.

00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,770
<31-4,PROPMASTER>是啊  那个段子糟透了
<31-4,PROPMASTER>Yeah, that sketch sucked.

838
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:51,080
<31-4,PROPMASTER>我们好多年没用过那些面具了
<31-4,PROPMASTER>We haven't used those masks in years.

839
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,910
<31-5,BECKETT>有出借登记记录吗
<31-5,BECKETT>Well, is there a record of someone signing it out?

840
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:54,400
<31-6,PROPMASTER>可能没有  但我可以查查
<31-6,PROPMASTER>Probably not, but I can check.

00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,450
<31-6,PROPMASTER>能给我五分钟吗
<31-6,PROPMASTER>Can you give me like five minutes?

00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,340
<32-2,BECKETT>是啊  但谁如此肆无忌惮
<32-2,BECKETT>Yeah, but who would be so brazen --

845
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:06,540
<32-2,BECKETT>或者如此天真地戴着节目里的面具
<32-2,BECKETT>or so naive -- as to use a mask from the show

846
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:08,340
<32-2,BECKETT>去实施绑架呢
<32-2,BECKETT>to perpetrate a kidnapping?

00:34:49,930 --> 00:34:52,340
<33-2,CHAD>很棒的五年  怎么了

889
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,010
<33-4,CHAD>对我来说  这值得等待
<33-4,CHAD>Uh, for me, it's worth the wait.

<33-4,CHAD>任何一天我都可能升职

<33-5,BECKETT>Yeah, sorry. I don't buy it.

892
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:03,590
<33-5,BECKETT>我认为你等得厌烦了
<33-5,BECKETT>I think you got tired of waiting,

893
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:06,110
<33-5,BECKETT>这么多年后  你想要回报
<33-5,BECKETT>and after so many years, you wanted payback.

894
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,600
<33-6,CHAD>回报  你指的是什么回报
<33-6,CHAD>Payback? What do you mean, payback?

895
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,870
<33-7,BECKETT>我说的是400万美元的那种回报
<33-7,BECKETT>I'm talking about the $4 million kind.

896
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:13,580
<33-7,BECKETT>你绑架了希德的前妻
<33-7,BECKETT>You kidnapped Sid's ex-wife.

897
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,810
<33-8,CHAD>等等  什么
<33-8,CHAD>Wait, what?

898
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,110
<33-9,CASTLE>这个计划挺巧妙的
<33-9,CASTLE>It was a pretty clever plan.

899
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:19,200
<33-9,CASTLE>只有一个小细节
<33-9,CASTLE>All except for that one tiny detail

900
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,010
<33-9,CASTLE>你没预见到
<33-9,CASTLE>that you could not have foreseen --

901
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:23,910
<33-9,CASTLE>希德在交钱时与你对峙
<33-9,CASTLE>Sid confronting you at the money drop.

902
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:27,080
<33-9,CASTLE>他认出了你的戒指  是吧
<33-9,CASTLE>He recognized your ring, didn't he?

903
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:30,500
<33-9,CASTLE>那时你意识到你唯一的出路
<33-9,CASTLE>That was when you realized your only way out

904
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:31,620
<33-9,CASTLE>就是杀了他
<33-9,CASTLE>was to kill him.

905
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:35,370
<33-10,CHAD>你觉得我杀了罗斯先生
<33-10,CHAD>You think I killed Mr. Ross?

906
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:37,620
<33-11,CASTLE>别装了  我们知道你的所作所为
<33-11,CASTLE>You can drop the act. We know what you did.

907
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:39,180
<33-11,CASTLE>就连伊芙琳也看到了你的戒指
<33-11,CASTLE>Even Evelyn saw your ring.

908
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:42,960
<33-12,CHAD>这枚戒指是我在SNT纪念品店买的
<33-12,CHAD>I bought this ring at the "S.N.T." gift shop.

909
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,440
<33-12,CHAD>很多人都有
<33-12,CHAD>Lots of people have it.

910
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,320
<33-13,BECKETT>是啊  但其他人的公寓里
<33-13,BECKETT>Yeah, except lots of people don't have evidence

911
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:47,740
<33-13,BECKETT>可没有证据
<33-13,BECKETT>in their apartments.

912
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:50,360
<33-14,CHAD>你在说什么
<33-14,CHAD>What are you talking about?

913
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:51,690
<33-14,CHAD>我什么都没做
<33-14,CHAD>I didn't do anything!

914
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:53,370
<33-15,BECKETT>那你倒是解释下为什么警探会在你床下
<33-15,BECKETT>So then why don't you explain how detectives found

915
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:57,710
<33-15,BECKETT>找到一把点38左轮枪和一张墨西哥摔角面具
<33-15,BECKETT>a .38 revolver and a lucha libre mask under your bed?

916
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:03,610
<33-16,CHAD>一定是邪恶的牙仙放在那里的
<33-16,CHAD>Must have been an evil tooth fairy who put it there,

917
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:04,860
<33-16,CHAD>反正不是我
<33-16,CHAD>'cause it wasn't me.

918
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:09,420
<33-16,CHAD>求你们相信我  不是我
<33-16,CHAD>Please, I-I-I didn't do this.

919
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:12,100
<33-17,CASTLE>那么希德被害当晚你在哪里
<33-17,CASTLE>All right, then where were you the night that Sid was murdered?

920
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:14,390
<33-17,CASTLE>-在家  -有人能证实吗
<33-17,CASTLE>- At home. - Can anyone verify that?

921
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,010
<33-17,CASTLE>没有
<33-17,CASTLE>No.

922
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:25,440
<34-1,VALENTINE>希德是个严厉的混蛋  但他爱他的工作
<34-1,VALENTINE>Sid was a tough S.O.B., but he loved his job,

923
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,100
<34-1,VALENTINE>他的工作是让我们逗美国人民笑
<34-1,VALENTINE>and his job was to get us to make America laugh.

924
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:31,100
<34-1,VALENTINE>今晚我们通过这种方式向他致敬
<34-1,VALENTINE>And tonight we honor him by doing just that.

925
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:33,030
<34-2,CASTLE>查德不可能是凶手  对吧
<34-2,CASTLE>Chad can't be the killer, can he?

926
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:34,200
<34-3,BECKETT>感觉不对劲
<34-3,BECKETT>Well, it doesn't feel right,

927
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,920
<34-3,BECKETT>但的确有很多对他不利的证据
<34-3,BECKETT>but there is an abundance of evidence.

928
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,590
<34-4,CASTLE>太多了  面具  凶器  戒指
<34-4,CASTLE>Yeah, it's too abundant -- the mask, the gun, the ring?

929
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:40,410
<34-4,CASTLE>太...完美了
<34-4,CASTLE>It's just too...perfect.

930
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:42,000
<34-5,BECKETT>你觉得他被嫁祸了
<34-5,BECKETT>So, what, you think he was framed?

931
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,710
<34-6,CASTLE>我觉得另有内情
<34-6,CASTLE>I think there's more to this story.

932
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:46,350
<34-7,BECKETT>有可能凶手想让伊芙琳
<34-7,BECKETT>You know, it's possible that the killer wanted

933
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:48,310
<34-7,BECKETT>看到面具和戒指
<34-7,BECKETT>Evelyn to see the mask and the ring.

934
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:49,850
<34-8,CASTLE>查德是完美的替罪羊
<34-8,CASTLE>Chad is the perfect fall guy.

935
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:52,850
<34-9,BECKETT>如果不是查德  是谁干的呢
<34-9,BECKETT>Okay, but if Chad didn't do it, then who did?

936
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,460
<34-10,RYAN>我可能找到了线索
<34-10,RYAN>I...may have a line on that.

937
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:57,560
<34-10,RYAN>我知道希德在办公室看电子表格
<34-10,RYAN>I figured out what Sid was doing in his office

938
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,010
<34-10,RYAN>是为什么了
<34-10,RYAN>with those spreadsheets.

939
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:01,320
<34-10,RYAN>他在查看公司的银行账户
<34-10,RYAN>He was going over his corporate bank accounts.

940
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:03,800
<34-11,BECKETT>希德在枪口下给劫匪付赎金
<34-11,BECKETT>Sid went from paying a kidnapper at gunpoint

941
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,240
<34-11,BECKETT>然后查看公司财务
<34-11,BECKETT>to checking his corporate financials?

942
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,170
<34-13,CASTLE>好...奇怪
<34-13,CASTLE>That's...weird.

943
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:09,480
<34-12,RYAN>不只是这件事奇怪
<34-12,RYAN>That's not the only thing that's weird.

944
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,540
<34-12,RYAN>看看他涂亮的部分
<34-12,RYAN>Check out those expenses he highlighted.

945
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:16,900
<34-13,CASTLE>这些奇怪是因为
<34-13,CASTLE>Oh, these are weird, because...

946
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,640
<34-14,RYAN>因为我给开曼群岛的银行打了电话
<34-14,RYAN>Because I called the bank in the Cayman Islands.

947
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,480
<34-14,RYAN>这些开支都是伪造的
<34-14,RYAN>All of those expenses are bogus.

948
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:24,160
<34-15,BECKETT>某个能着手希德公司的人在挪用公款
<34-15,BECKETT>So someone with access at Sid's company was embezzling money.

949
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,990
<34-16,RYAN>数额接近400万
<34-16,RYAN>Almost $4 million,

950
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:28,080
<34-16,RYAN>跟赎金一样
<34-16,RYAN>The exact amount of the ransom.

951
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:29,310
<34-16,RYAN>这就是了
<34-16,RYAN>Wait, that's it.

952
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,420
<34-17,CASTLE>挪用公款的人试图把从希德那偷来的钱
<34-17,CASTLE>The embezzler was trying to replace the money

953
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:32,830
<34-17,CASTLE>补回来
<34-17,CASTLE>he had stolen from sid.

954
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:34,640
<34-18,BECKETT>-我知道凶手是谁了  -我知道凶手是谁了
<34-18,BECKETT>- I know who the killer is. - I know who the killer is.

955
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:37,640
<34-19,CASTLE>赞  不过我得说是我把你领上正路
<34-19,CASTLE>Nice. In fairness, though, I walked you right through that.

956
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,830
<35-1,STAGE MANAGER>最后一个段子准备好
<35-1,STAGE MANAGER>Places for the final sketch!

957
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,200
<35-1,STAGE MANAGER>最后一个段子准备好
<35-1,STAGE MANAGER>Places for the final sketch.

958
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,550
<35-2,LIZ>一切还好吗
<35-2,LIZ>Hi. I-is everything all right?

959
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:02,270
<35-3,BECKETT>是的  事实上  我们有好消息
<35-3,BECKETT>Yes. In fact, we have some good news.

960
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:04,220
<35-4,VOGEL>好极了  节目结束后咱们聊
<35-4,VOGEL>Great. Let's talk after the show.

961
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:07,070
<35-5,CASTLE>演出已经结束了  至少对你来说
<35-5,CASTLE>Actually, show is already over -- at least for you.

962
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:09,660
<35-6,VOGEL>-什么  -别装了  沃格尔先生
<35-6,VOGEL>- Excuse me? - Drop the act, Mr. Vogel.

963
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:11,030
<35-7,BECKETT>我们知道是你杀了希德
<35-7,BECKETT>We know that you killed Sid.

964
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,290
<35-9,CASTLE>-这太疯狂了  -并不
<35-9,CASTLE>- That's insane. - Not really.

965
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,880
<35-9,CASTLE>考虑到希德公司分批销售
<35-9,CASTLE>Not considering the partial sale of Sid's company

966
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,160
<35-9,CASTLE>在即  一旦销售就意味着
<35-9,CASTLE>was on the horizon, a sale that would mean

967
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,060
<35-9,CASTLE>公司财务核查
<35-9,CASTLE>a review of the company's books.

968
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:23,470
<35-10,BECKETT>那将揭露你盗用400万公司公款
<35-10,BECKETT>Which would expose the $4 million that you embezzled.

969
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:25,930
<35-11,VOGEL>什么  你们发疯了吗
<35-11,VOGEL>What?! Are you out of your mind?

970
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,840
<35-12,CASTLE>没有  发疯的是你
<35-12,CASTLE>No, but you must have been.

971
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,550
<35-12,CASTLE>面对恶行被揭穿的现实
<35-12,CASTLE>Faced with the inevitability of being caught,

972
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:31,220
<35-12,CASTLE>你得有所行动
<35-12,CASTLE>you had to do something,

973
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,090
<35-12,CASTLE>于是你绑架伊芙琳  索要赎金
<35-12,CASTLE>so you kidnapped and ransomed Evelyn

974
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:36,570
<35-12,CASTLE>以便偿还你盗用的钱款
<35-12,CASTLE>in order to "reimburse" the money you'd stolen.

975
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:39,290
<35-13,BECKETT>一大包现金更容易存入
<35-13,BECKETT>A duffel bag full of cash would be easy to deposit

976
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:41,330
<35-13,BECKETT>公司在开曼群岛的银行
<35-13,BECKETT>in the company's Cayman Island bank,

977
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:43,410
<35-13,BECKETT>没人会提出质疑
<35-13,BECKETT>where no questions are asked.

978
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:44,680
<35-14,CASTLE>那之后  你只需
<35-14,CASTLE>And after that, all you'd have to do

979
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:47,070
<35-14,CASTLE>伪造银行对账单
<35-14,CASTLE>is falsify a few bank statements,

980
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:48,280
<35-14,CASTLE>你就高枕无忧了
<35-14,CASTLE>and you'd be in the clear.

981
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,660
<35-15,VOGEL>你们怎么敢这样  太扯了
<35-15,VOGEL>How dare you. This is absurd!

982
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:52,060
<35-16,BECKETT>我们追踪的钱款  基恩
<35-16,BECKETT>We followed the money, Gene.

983
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:55,990
<35-16,BECKETT>你从公司取出400万  投资创业公司
<35-16,BECKETT>You siphoned the $4 million to invest in a startup company.

984
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:57,730
<35-17,CASTLE>当公司破产
<35-17,CASTLE>And when that company went belly-up,

985
00:38:57,730 --> 00:38:59,170
<35-17,CASTLE>你拿不回你的钱
<35-17,CASTLE>you could not get your money back.

986
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,280
<35-18,BECKETT>希德定是在碰头地点认出了你
<35-18,BECKETT>Sid must have recognized you at the drop,

987
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,770
<35-18,BECKETT>但在那之后  他没有与你对质  直到他发现
<35-18,BECKETT>but he didn't confront you until after he discovered

988
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:05,280
<35-18,BECKETT>伪造的开支
<35-18,BECKETT>the faked expenses.

989
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:07,680
<35-19,LIZ>所以你就杀了他
<35-19,LIZ>So you killed him?

990
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:08,780
<35-19,LIZ>基恩  你怎么能这样做
<35-19,LIZ>Gene, how could you?

991
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:11,700
<35-20,VOGEL>不  这都是无凭证的指控
<35-20,VOGEL>No! These are -- these are baseless accusations.

992
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,770
<35-20,VOGEL>-他们什么证实不了  -事实上  我们可以
<35-20,VOGEL>- They can't prove anything. - Actually, we can.

993
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:15,240
<35-21,BECKETT>我们查了你的财务  发现
<35-21,BECKETT>We went through your financials and found

994
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:18,330
<35-21,BECKETT>数百万来自希德公司的未申报存款
<35-21,BECKETT>millions in undeclared deposits from Sid's company.

995
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:19,830
<35-22,CASTLE>顺便提一句
<35-22,CASTLE>Oh, by the way, nice touch

996
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:23,260
<35-22,CASTLE>戴面具  戴查德的SNT戒指够绝
<35-22,CASTLE>wearing the mask and "S.N.T." ring that Chad has.

997
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:25,020
<35-22,CASTLE>你栽赃陷害的唯一破绽是
<35-22,CASTLE>Only problem with your frame job --

998
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:26,680
<35-22,CASTLE>你当天下午投放栽赃物时
<35-22,CASTLE>you were witnessed hanging around

999
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:29,460
<35-22,CASTLE>有人看到你在他的公寓外
<35-22,CASTLE>outside his apartment this afternoon when you planted them.

1000
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,830
<35-23,BECKETT>基恩·沃格尔  你因...
