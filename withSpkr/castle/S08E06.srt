<1-1,JAVIER ESPOSITO>最好最坏打算  这些人危险至极
<1-1,JAVIER ESPOSITO>Expect the worst. These guys are beyond dangerous.

2
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,090
<1-2,KEVIN RYAN>行动
<1-2,KEVIN RYAN>Let's go.

00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:51,240
<1-2,KEVIN RYAN>别动  举起手来
<1-2,KEVIN RYAN>Don't move! Show me your hands!

9
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:57,330
<2-1,DETECTIVE ETHAN SLAUGHTER>你就带来这么点人吗
<2-1,DETECTIVE ETHAN SLAUGHTER>Is that all the guys you brought?

13
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:06,880
<2-1,DETECTIVE ETHAN SLAUGHTER>你还好吗  孩子
<2-1,DETECTIVE ETHAN SLAUGHTER>How you holding up, kiddo?

14
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:11,210
<2-1,DETECTIVE ETHAN SLAUGHTER>这分居真是越来越烦人了
<2-1,DETECTIVE ETHAN SLAUGHTER>This separation thing is getting really old.

16
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:12,090
<3-1,MARTHA ROGERS>我知道
<3-1,MARTHA ROGERS>I know.

17
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,200
<3-2,CASTLE>但凯瑟琳现在处于十字路口
<3-2,CASTLE>But Katherine is at a crossroads.

18
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,310
<3-3,MARTHA>她年轻时的丧亲之痛
<3-3,MARTHA>The loss she suffered when she was young

19
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,990
<3-3,MARTHA>改变了她
<3-3,MARTHA>has just changed her in ways

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,440
<3-3,MARTHA>而她现在才开始发现改变有多深
<3-3,MARTHA>that she is just now beginning to realize.

21
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:27,630
<3-3,MARTHA>要不要妈妈主动给你点建议
<3-3,MARTHA>Can your mother give you a little unsolicited advice?

22
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,370
<3-5,MARTHA>-不要  -那太遗憾了
<3-5,MARTHA>- No. - Too bad.

23
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:31,140
<3-5,MARTHA>我需要推敲材料
<3-5,MARTHA>I need to work on my material.

24
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,300
<3-6,CASTLE>-推敲材料  -我没说过吗
<3-6,CASTLE>- Your material? - Didn't I tell you?

25
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,490
<3-7,MARTHA>我在写书
<3-7,MARTHA>I'm writing a book.

26
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:37,040
<3-7,MARTHA>《主动忠告》  玛莎·罗杰斯著
<3-7,MARTHA>"Unsolicited Advice" by Martha Rodgers.

27
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:37,910
<3-7,MARTHA>这简直
<3-7,MARTHA>That's...

28
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,210
<3-8,CASTLE>这还真是个好主意
<3-8,CASTLE>That's actually a great idea.

29
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:42,840
<3-8,CASTLE>是啊  是吧
<3-8,CASTLE>I know. Isn't it?

30
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,650
<3-9,MARTHA>你的代理人也很喜欢
<3-9,MARTHA>Oh, and your agent loved it, too.

31
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:46,420
<3-10,CASTLE>-我代理人  -别管那个了
<3-10,CASTLE>- My agent? - Never you mind that.

32
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:47,350
<3-11,MARTHA>听好
<3-11,MARTHA>Just listen.

33
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,850
<3-11,MARTHA>有点信心
<3-11,MARTHA>Have faith.

34
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:51,220
<3-11,MARTHA>你和凯瑟琳之间的事
<3-11,MARTHA>Things between you and Katherine

35
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,650
<3-11,MARTHA>一般都会自行解决
<3-11,MARTHA>have a tendency to just work themselves out.

36
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:54,810
<3-11,MARTHA>我觉得她离开
<3-11,MARTHA>I think it's probably good

37
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,990
<3-11,MARTHA>几天或许也是好事
<3-11,MARTHA>that she's out of town for a couple of days

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,320
<3-11,MARTHA>你正需要与她分开一段时间
<3-11,MARTHA>because a little time apart is just what you need.

39
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:04,250
<3-12,CASTLE>我需要个办法分分神
<3-12,CASTLE>What I need is a distraction.

40
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:07,070
<4-1,NEWSCASTER>被称为纽约最
<4-1,NEWSCASTER>The burglary at what has been labeled

41
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:10,330
<4-1,NEWSCASTER>安全的大楼发生的盗窃案显然
<4-1,NEWSCASTER>New York's most secure building is clearly a black eye

43
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,260
<4-1,NEWSCASTER>打了亿万富翁开发商雷纳德·布斯的脸
<4-1,NEWSCASTER>for billionaire developer Ronald Booth,

44
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:15,130
<4-1,NEWSCASTER>他仍未透露具体被盗了什么
<4-1,NEWSCASTER>who's keeping quiet about exactly what was stolen

45
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,290
<4-1,NEWSCASTER>但之前发表了这一番言论
<4-1,NEWSCASTER>but had this to say earlier.

<5-5,ALEXIS>He just said he was an old friend.

58
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,580
<5-6,CASTLE>这绝不是好事
<5-6,CASTLE>That can't be good.

59
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:56,370
<5-7,MARTHA>这是几年前

81
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:55,880

<5-20,SLAUGHTER>你真是有位虎妈啊  大侦探
<5-20,SLAUGHTER>Well, you got a real mama lion here, Sherlock.

86
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,040
<5-20,SLAUGHTER>但不必担心

<5-20,SLAUGHTER>我要找你办的事绝不会害你涉嫌的
<5-20,SLAUGHTER>What I'm here about won't put you in a lick of danger.

90
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:13,360
<5-22,SLAUGHTER>我在办的案子需要人帮忙
<5-22,SLAUGHTER>The case I'm working on and need help with...

91
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,500
<5-22,SLAUGHTER>是一栋市中心的高级大楼的盗窃案
<5-22,SLAUGHTER>a high-end burglary in this big, shiny building in midtown.

92
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:18,590
<5-23,ALEXIS>纽约最安全大楼吗
<5-23,ALEXIS>The most secure building in New York?

93
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:20,820
<5-23,ALEXIS>我刚在新闻里看到
<5-23,ALEXIS>I just watched a news report about it.

94
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,580
<5-24,SLAUGHTER>看来有人绕过了警报系统
<5-24,SLAUGHTER>Yeah, seems, uh, somebody was able to bypass the alarm system

95
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:27,970
<5-24,SLAUGHTER>偷走了什么绝密微型芯片
<5-24,SLAUGHTER>and steal themselves some sort of top-secret microchip.

96
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,020
<5-24,SLAUGHTER>这事以我的智商有点理解不了
<5-24,SLAUGHTER>The whole... the whole thing's above my intellectual pay grade,

97
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,700
<5-24,SLAUGHTER>所以我想着大侦探可以帮帮忙
<5-24,SLAUGHTER>so I thought Sherlock here could help me out.

98
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:33,070
<5-25,CASTLE>你不是黑帮特遣队的吗
<5-25,CASTLE>I-I thought you were gang task force.

99
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,630
<5-26,SLAUGHTER>那个干腻味了
<5-26,SLAUGHTER>Oh, yeah, I got tired of that.

100
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:36,920
<5-26,SLAUGHTER>我开始搞新一级别的混蛋了
<5-26,SLAUGHTER>I moved on to a whole new class of dirtbags.

101
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,010
<5-27,CASTLE>多谢你来找我
<5-27,CASTLE>I-I'm flattered you thought of me,

<5-27,CASTLE>但是...我日程都满了
<5-27,CASTLE>but I'm just... I'm... I have my... my schedule is so full.

103

112
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,340

<6-1,LANIE PARISH>Killed between 10:00 and 2:00 last night.

128
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,760
<6-2,RYAN>好吧  看看被害人在跟谁通话
<6-2,RYAN>All right. Let's find out who the victim was talking to.

129
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,450
<6-3,ESPOSITO>他脸上的淤青呢
<6-3,ESPOSITO>What about that bruising on his face?

130
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:42,380
<6-4,LANIE>那个更早
<6-4,LANIE>That's older.

131
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:46,020
<6-4,LANIE>看来这24小时内有人折磨过李先生
<6-4,LANIE>Looks like someone worked Mr. Lee over within the last 24 hours.

132
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,730
<6-5,ESPOSITO>能从凶器上提取到指纹吗
<6-5,ESPOSITO>Any hope of getting a print off that murder weapon?

133
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,990
<6-6,LANIE>恐怕不会  看上去似乎是擦过
<6-6,LANIE>Doubtful. Looks like it's been wiped clean.

134
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,430
<6-7,RYAN>埃斯波
<6-7,RYAN>Hey, Espo.

135
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:54,050
<6-7,RYAN>猜猜被害人最后打给的是谁
<6-7,RYAN>Guess who the last person our victim called was.

136
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:54,890
<6-8,ESPOSITO>知道我现在多么
<6-8,ESPOSITO>Do you know how hard it is

137
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:56,490
<6-8,ESPOSITO>拼命忍着不说"你妈妈"吗
<6-8,ESPOSITO>for me to not say "your mama" right now?

138
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:00,010
<6-9,ESPOSITO>斯勒特
<6-9,ESPOSITO>Slaughter?

139
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,060
<6-10,SLAUGHTER>我哥们怎么了
<6-10,SLAUGHTER>What the hell happened to my guy?

140
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,280
<6-11,ESPOSITO>卡塞尔  斯勒特
<6-11,ESPOSITO>Castle. Slaughter.

141
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,070
<6-11,ESPOSITO>我可没想到会看到你俩一起出现
<6-11,ESPOSITO>This is not a pairing I would have expected.

142
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,080
<6-12,CASTLE>可不是
<6-12,CASTLE>I know, right?

143
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:10,930
<6-13,SLAUGHTER>我是说  又聚首了哦
<6-13,SLAUGHTER>I mean... together again!

144
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,040
<6-14,CASTLE>好诶
<6-14,CASTLE>Yay!

145
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:13,460
<6-15,SLAUGHTER>有线索吗
<6-15,SLAUGHTER>You got any leads?

146
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,860
<6-16,RYAN>嗯  被害人昨晚给你打过电话
<6-16,RYAN>Yeah... we got our victim calling you last night.

147
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,240
<6-16,RYAN>想说说你俩谈了什么吗
<6-16,RYAN>Care to share what you talked about?

148
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,160
<6-16,RYAN>维克多是我的线人
<6-16,RYAN>Victor was my C.I.

149
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,110
<6-17,SLAUGHTER>我手里最好的告密鬼
<6-17,SLAUGHTER>Best damn snitch I ever had.

150
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:23,500
<6-17,SLAUGHTER>他根本不是罪犯  他是个汉堡餐馆的经理
<6-17,SLAUGHTER>'cause he wasn't a criminal. He managed some burger joint.

151
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,710
<6-17,SLAUGHTER>但跟一群人渣一起长大
<6-17,SLAUGHTER>But he grew up with a rogues' gallery of lowlifes,

152
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:28,200
<6-17,SLAUGHTER>他们蠢得忍不住不跟他吹嘘
<6-17,SLAUGHTER>and they were just too stupid not to keep bragging to him

153
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,820
<6-17,SLAUGHTER>他们犯下的各种罪行
<6-17,SLAUGHTER>about all the crimes they were committing.

154
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:31,280
<6-18,ESPOSITO>他打给你做什么
<6-18,ESPOSITO>So, what was he calling you about?

155
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,360
<6-19,SLAUGHTER>他在打探我调查的一桩盗窃案的消息
<6-19,SLAUGHTER>Ah, he was doing some digging on this burglary I'm investigating.

156
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,660
<6-20,RYAN>看来他是因此被杀了
<6-20,RYAN>Well, looks like that digging might have got him killed.

157
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:38,870
<6-21,SLAUGHTER>你是说这是我的错吗
<6-21,SLAUGHTER>Are you saying this is my fault?

158
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:42,380
<6-22,CASTLE>除了你  维克多还向别人告密吗
<6-22,CASTLE>I-- well, was Victor talking to anyone else besides you?

159
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:43,930
<6-23,SLAUGHTER>不  他说要去见个什么人
<6-23,SLAUGHTER>No, he said he was gonna go meet someone.

160
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:45,010
<6-23,SLAUGHTER>但没告诉我名字
<6-23,SLAUGHTER>He didn't give me that name.

161
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:47,620
<6-24,CASTLE>那么我们第一步就是找到那人
<6-24,CASTLE>All right, then, our first step is to identify that guy.

162
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:50,020
<6-25,RYAN>不  那是我们的职责  这是凶案组的案子
<6-25,RYAN>No, that's our job. This is a homicide investigation.

163
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,950
<6-26,SLAUGHTER>怎么地  先是我的案子的  维克多是我的人
<6-26,SLAUGHTER>Tough! It was my case first. Victor was my guy.

164
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,410
<6-26,SLAUGHTER>我们要一起找到杀了他的那个鼠辈
<6-26,SLAUGHTER>So we're gonna find the rodent that killed him together.

165
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:56,410
<6-26,SLAUGHTER>走吧  大侦探
<6-26,SLAUGHTER>Come on, Sherlock.

166
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,130
<6-27,ESPOSITO>好吧  但是  斯勒特
<6-27,ESPOSITO>All right, but, Slaughter,

167
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:00,550
<6-27,ESPOSITO>你们做什么都得告诉我们一声
<6-27,ESPOSITO>you're gonna keep us in the loop on every move you make.

168
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:01,670
<6-28,SLAUGHTER>当然了
<6-28,SLAUGHTER>Of course.

169
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,430
<6-28,SLAUGHTER>我最懂得配合了
<6-28,SLAUGHTER>I'm a team player.

170
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,810
<7-1,SLAUGHTER>我完全是骗他们的
<7-1,SLAUGHTER>I totally lied to those guys.

171
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:08,720
<7-1,SLAUGHTER>我已经有
<7-1,SLAUGHTER>I already got a line on

172
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,420
<7-1,SLAUGHTER>维克多昨晚见的人的线索了
<7-1,SLAUGHTER>who Victor might have met with last night.

173
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,080
<7-2,CASTLE>你不觉得这消息该跟
<7-2,CASTLE>Don't you think that's information we should share

174
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,260
<7-2,CASTLE>莱恩和埃斯波西托分享吗
<7-2,CASTLE>with Ryan and Esposito?

175
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:15,090
<7-3,SLAUGHTER>不
<7-3,SLAUGHTER>Nah.

176
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,120
<7-3,SLAUGHTER>这多好玩
<7-3,SLAUGHTER>Isn't this fun?

177
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,550
<7-3,SLAUGHTER>你我又再次联手
<7-3,SLAUGHTER>You and me together again.

178
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:19,050
<7-3,SLAUGHTER>就像虎豹小霸王
<7-3,SLAUGHTER>Like Butch and Sundance.

179
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:23,320
<7-4,CASTLE>你应该知道电影最后他俩死了吧  对吗
<7-4,CASTLE>You know they die at the end of the movie, right?

180
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:26,100
<7-5,SLAUGHTER>知道  但死得多酷啊
<7-5,SLAUGHTER>Yeah. But what a way to go.

181
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:31,200
<8-1,DAWN>我无法相信  我昨天还有和他说话
<8-1,DAWN>I can't believe it. I just talked to him yesterday.

182
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:32,580
<8-2,CASTLE>你和他说了什么
<8-2,CASTLE>What did you talk to him about?

183
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,920
<8-3,DAWN>重新在一起
<8-3,DAWN>Getting back together.

184
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:35,600
<8-3,DAWN>我们几个月前分手了
<8-3,DAWN>We broke up a few months ago.

185
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,590
<8-3,DAWN>我厌倦了他的说话不算话
<8-3,DAWN>I got sick of him not keeping his word.

186
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,050
<8-3,DAWN>但是他说这次会有所不同
<8-3,DAWN>But he said it was gonna be different this time.

187
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,210
<8-3,DAWN>告诉我他马上能挣一大笔钱
<8-3,DAWN>Told me he was about to come into some big money.

188
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:45,450
<8-3,DAWN>我们在讨论一起离开
<8-3,DAWN>We were talking about taking off together --

189
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:46,510
<8-3,DAWN>去加利福尼亚
<8-3,DAWN>California.

190
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,740
<8-3,DAWN>我一直想住在海滨
<8-3,DAWN>I always wanted to live on the beach.

191
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:51,290
<8-4,SLAUGHTER>他有没有说这笔钱会从哪来
<8-4,SLAUGHTER>Did he say where this big money was coming from?

192
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,790
<8-5,DAWN>没有
<8-5,DAWN>No.

193
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,260
<8-6,CASTLE>可不可以请你稍等片刻
<8-6,CASTLE>Would you excuse us for a second?

194
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,930
<8-7,CASTLE>你觉不觉得维克多可能和那个微型芯片
<8-7,CASTLE>Do you think Victor might have been involved

195
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,090
<8-7,CASTLE>失窃有关
<8-7,CASTLE>in stealing that microchip?

196
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:03,650
<8-8,SLAUGHTER>不可能  他是个老实人
<8-8,SLAUGHTER>No way. He was a straight arrow.

197
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,080
<8-9,CASTLE>我知道你欣赏这个人
<8-9,CASTLE>I know you liked the guy,

198
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:06,760
<8-9,CASTLE>但是他做着最低工资的工作
<8-9,CASTLE>but he was working a minimum-wage job

199
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,220
<8-9,CASTLE>而他周围违法的哥们都日进斗金
<8-9,CASTLE>while all his criminal buddies were pulling in big cash.

200
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:10,980
<8-9,CASTLE>你真的觉得他不可能
<8-9,CASTLE>Is it so impossible to believe

201
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,400
<8-9,CASTLE>屈服于这样的诱惑吗
<8-9,CASTLE>that he might have given in to temptation?

202
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:14,840
<8-10,SLAUGHTER>好吧  这有可能
<8-10,SLAUGHTER>Yeah, it's possible.

203
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,400
<8-10,SLAUGHTER>我只是不愿相信他耍了我
<8-10,SLAUGHTER>I just hate the idea he was playing me.

204
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,180
<8-11,CASTLE>维克多有提过昨晚他要和谁见面吗
<8-11,CASTLE>Did victor say who he was meeting with last night?

205
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,310
<8-12,DAWN>一个叫特鲁科的人
<8-12,DAWN>Some guy named Trucco.

206
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,890
<9-1,RYAN>我查了一下斯勒特手里的盗窃案
<9-1,RYAN>So, I looked into Slaughter's burglary case.

207
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:28,430
<9-1,RYAN>盗贼偷走了
<9-1,RYAN>The burglars made off with

208
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:30,940
<9-1,RYAN>一个用于下一代手机的微型芯片
<9-1,RYAN>a microchip for a next-gen cellphone.

209
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,750
<9-1,RYAN>原型在黑市上价值超过一百万美元
<9-1,RYAN>Prototype is worth north of a million bucks on the black market.

210
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,980
<9-1,RYAN>维克拉姆正在已知黑市贩数据库里
<9-1,RYAN>Vikram is looking in the database of known fences

211
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,650
<9-1,RYAN>找处理这类赃物的人
<9-1,RYAN>to find out who deals in that kind of loot.

212
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,910
<9-2,ESPOSITO>鉴证组在凶器上找到了一枚指纹
<9-2,ESPOSITO>Yo. CSU managed to find a print on the murder weapon.

213
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:42,380
<9-2,ESPOSITO>藏在刀柄下面
<9-2,ESPOSITO>It was hidden under the hilt of the knife.

214
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:43,660
<9-3,RYAN>他们在系统里找到吻合的了吗
<9-3,RYAN>They get a match in the system?

215
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:44,870
<9-4,ESPOSITO>找到了  他们在发过来
<9-4,ESPOSITO>Yeah, they're sending it now.

<10-1,SLAUGHTER>他是个专营高科技的黑市贩
<10-1,SLAUGHTER>Turns out he's a fence specializing in high tech.

221
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,400
<10-1,SLAUGHTER>我们去问问他如何
<10-1,SLAUGHTER>What say we go shake his tree?

<11-9,SLAUGHTER>It's Elvez and lucky charms, isn't it?

250
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:49,350
<11-10,CASTLE>出了点小问题
<11-10,CASTLE>There's a slight problem.

251
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:50,380
<11-11,SLAUGHTER>把电话给我
<11-11,SLAUGHTER>Give me that phone.

252
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:56,420
<11-12,SLAUGHTER>你是谁  G型神探吗
<11-12,SLAUGHTER>What are you, Inspector Gadget?

253
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:57,390
<11-12,SLAUGHTER>这是把枪  不是支笔
<11-12,SLAUGHTER>This is a gun, not a pen.

254
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:00,010
<11-12,SLAUGHTER>你不该把它放在桌子里  应该带在身上
<11-12,SLAUGHTER>You don't keep it in your desk. You strap it to your side.

255
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,900
<11-12,SLAUGHTER>或者对你来说  放在你的小提包里
<11-12,SLAUGHTER>Or, in your case, keep it in your purse.

256
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:02,840
<11-13,CASTLE>请不要杀我
<11-13,CASTLE>Please don't kill me.

257
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:05,140
<11-14,SLAUGHTER>-我不会杀你  -你把刀插进维克多脖子里
<11-14,SLAUGHTER>- I'm not gonna kill you. - Is that what you told Victor

258
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,650
<11-15,CASTLE>前也对他这么说的吗
<11-15,CASTLE>before you buried a knife in his neck?

259
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:07,680
<11-16,SLAUGHTER>不是我干的
<11-16,SLAUGHTER>That wasn't me.

260
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,870
<11-17,CASTLE>那为什么凶器上全是你的指纹
<11-17,CASTLE>Then why were your fingerprints all over the murder weapon?

261
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:13,130
<11-18,SLAUGHTER>我送那把刀给维克多是为了谢谢他
<11-18,SLAUGHTER>I gave Victor that knife as a thank-you.

262
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,500
<11-19,CASTLE>致谢礼
<11-19,CASTLE>A thank-you gi--

263
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,310
<11-19,CASTLE>鲜花是不错的致谢礼物
<11-19,CASTLE>Flowers are a nice thank-you gift.

264
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:17,850
<11-19,CASTLE>一把大号兰博刀  简直神经病
<11-19,CASTLE>A giant rambo knife -- that's psychotic.

265
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,870
<11-20,SLAUGHTER>做法不同  不过这是事实
<11-20,SLAUGHTER>Eh, different strokes. But it's the truth.

266
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,410
<11-21,CASTLE>那么把你自己交给那哥俩
<11-21,CASTLE>Then just turn yourself in to the boys.

267
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:22,560
<11-21,CASTLE>他们会公正处理的
<11-21,CASTLE>They'll treat you fairly.

268
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:23,770
<11-22,SLAUGHTER>没那么简单
<11-22,SLAUGHTER>It ain't that simple.

269
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,890
<11-22,SLAUGHTER>昨天早晨当维克多拒绝给我调查
<11-22,SLAUGHTER>I may have hit Victor a few times yesterday morning

270
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:28,660
<11-22,SLAUGHTER>那起盗窃案的时候我可能打了他两下
<11-22,SLAUGHTER>when he wouldn't look into that burglary for me.

271
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:29,830
<11-22,SLAUGHTER>但我没有杀他
<11-22,SLAUGHTER>But I didn't kill him.

272
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,580
<11-23,CASTLE>一个拿枪指着我的人这么说
<11-23,CASTLE>Says the man holding a gun on me.

273
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,640
<11-23,CASTLE>给你  拿着
<11-23,CASTLE>Eh, here. Take it.

274
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,360
<11-24,SLAUGHTER>拿着
<11-24,SLAUGHTER>Take it!

275
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,560
<11-24,SLAUGHTER>我之前没有告诉你
<11-24,SLAUGHTER>I didn't tell you any of this before

276
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,790
<11-24,SLAUGHTER>是因为我知道这看起来是什么样
<11-24,SLAUGHTER>'cause I know how it looks.

277
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:39,840
<11-24,SLAUGHTER>你毫不犹豫就相信我杀了维克多
<11-24,SLAUGHTER>You didn't doubt for a second that I killed Victor.

278
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,020
<11-24,SLAUGHTER>其他人也不会犹豫
<11-24,SLAUGHTER>Neither will anyone else.

279
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,680
<11-24,SLAUGHTER>所以唯一能证明我清白就是找到真正的凶手
<11-24,SLAUGHTER>So the only way to clear my name is to find the real killer.

280
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:45,830
<11-24,SLAUGHTER>所以
<11-24,SLAUGHTER>So...

281
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:49,000
<11-25,CASTLE>为什么来找我
<11-25,CASTLE>Why come to me?

282
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:52,200
<11-26,SLAUGHTER>因为我敌人很多
<11-26,SLAUGHTER>'cause I got a lot of enemies.

283
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,480
<11-26,SLAUGHTER>却没有一个朋友
<11-26,SLAUGHTER>What I don't got's a friend.

284
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,780
<11-26,SLAUGHTER>我需要一个朋友  大侦探
<11-26,SLAUGHTER>I need a friend, Sherlock.

285
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,660
<12-1,ESPOSITO>斯勒特在哪
<12-1,ESPOSITO>Where's Slaughter?

286
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:14,710
<12-2,CASTLE>他走了  几分钟前离开了
<12-2,CASTLE>He's gone. He left a few minutes ago.

287
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,640
<12-4,CASTLE>-发生了什么  -他坚称自己是无辜的
<12-4,CASTLE>- What happened? - He insisted he was innocent.

288
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,770
<12-4,CASTLE>说那把刀是送给维克多的礼物
<12-4,CASTLE>Said he gave that knife to Victor as a gift.

289
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:22,530
<12-5,ESPOSITO>礼物  为什么不送一瓶好酒
<12-5,ESPOSITO>A gift? What's wrong with a nice bottle of wine?

290
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:23,260
<12-5,ESPOSITO>就是
<12-5,ESPOSITO>I know!

291
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,720
<12-6,CASTLE>不过  伙计们  我得告诉你们
<12-6,CASTLE>But, guys, I got to tell you

292
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,630
<12-6,CASTLE>他看上去说的是真的
<12-6,CASTLE>he really seemed like he was telling the truth.

293
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:27,620
<12-6,CASTLE>别想了
<12-6,CASTLE>Forget it.

294
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,440
<12-7,RYAN>那人说个一个字都不能信
<12-7,RYAN>You can't trust a word what that guy says.

295
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,190
<12-7,RYAN>你应该比谁都清楚这点  卡塞尔
<12-7,RYAN>You, above all people, should know that, Castle.

296
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:31,940
<12-8,ESPOSITO>他出格被抓
<12-8,ESPOSITO>It was only a matter of time

297
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,590
<12-8,ESPOSITO>只是时间问题
<12-8,ESPOSITO>until he crossed the line and got caught.

298
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,270
<12-9,RYAN>你能活下来完全是运气
<12-9,RYAN>You're just lucky to be alive.

299
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:36,730
<12-9,RYAN>离他远点
<12-9,RYAN>Stay away from him.

300
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:52,860
<12-10,CASTLE>我不喜欢对他们撒谎  不过你说得对
<12-10,CASTLE>I do not like lying to those guys, but you were right.

301
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,730
<12-10,CASTLE>他们不会相信你的
<12-10,CASTLE>They're not gonna give you the benefit of the doubt.

302
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,770
<12-11,SLAUGHTER>你是个好人  大侦探
<12-11,SLAUGHTER>You're a good man, sherlock.

<12-11,SLAUGHTER>现在我们是绑在一根绳上的蚂蚱
<12-11,SLAUGHTER>Now we're neck-deep in this together.

304
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,240

<13-23,SLAUGHTER>我强烈建议你告诉我们想知道的事
<13-23,SLAUGHTER>I strongly recommend you tell us what we want to know.

355
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,130
<13-24,TRUCCO>你们想知道什么
<13-24,TRUCCO>And what's that?

<13-25,CASTLE>你昨晚有没有从维克多那买来一块偷的微芯片
<13-25,CASTLE>Did you buy a stolen microchip from Victor last night?

360
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:20,260
<13-29,SLAUGHTER>拜托  先生  告诉我们事实
<13-29,SLAUGHTER>Please, sir, tell us the truth.

361
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:21,170
<13-30,TRUCCO>我说的是实话
<13-30,TRUCCO>I am.

362
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,060
<13-30,TRUCCO>维克多和他的搭档
<13-30,TRUCCO>Look, Victor and his partner were

363
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,990
<13-30,TRUCCO>昨晚约好跟我见面  但是他们没出现
<13-30,TRUCCO>supposed to meet me last night, but they never showed.

364
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:27,380
<13-31,CASTLE>-他的搭档是谁  -我不知道
<13-31,CASTLE>- Who's his partner? - I don't know.

365
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:29,050
<13-32,TRUCCO>不过从维克多跟他说话的口气上看
<13-32,TRUCCO>But from the way Victor talked about him,

366
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:31,010
<13-32,TRUCCO>他们的搭档关系不会再维系多久了
<13-32,TRUCCO>it seems like they weren't gonna be partners for long.

367
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,060
<13-33,CASTLE>你和我想的一样吗
<13-33,CASTLE>You thinking what I'm thinking?

368
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,820
<13-34,SLAUGHTER>可能不是
<13-34,SLAUGHTER>Probably not.

369
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:40,300
<13-35,CASTLE>可能维克多想独吞
<13-35,CASTLE>Like, maybe Victor got greedy

370
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,940
<13-35,CASTLE>想要出卖他的搭档
<13-35,CASTLE>tried to double-cross his partner?

371
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:44,410
<13-36,SLAUGHTER>然后搭档把他干掉了
<13-36,SLAUGHTER>The partner might have killed him for it.

372
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,060
<13-36,SLAUGHTER>好想法  大侦探  你看
<13-36,SLAUGHTER>Nice going, Sherlock. See?

373
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,110
<13-36,SLAUGHTER>我们配合得多好
<13-36,SLAUGHTER>We make a perfect team.

374
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:47,870
<13-36,SLAUGHTER>走吧
<13-36,SLAUGHTER>Let's go.

375
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:55,930
<13-37,CASTLE>怎么了
<13-37,CASTLE>What was that?

376
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,140
<13-38,SLAUGHTER>什么怎么了
<13-38,SLAUGHTER>What was what?

377
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,090
<14-1,RYAN>看看这个
<14-1,RYAN>Hey, check this out.

378
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:04,500
<14-1,RYAN>交通摄像头拍到维克多把车停在
<14-1,RYAN>Traffic cam caught Victor parked a block away

379
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,110
<14-1,RYAN>距离芯片被偷处一个街区之外的地方
<14-1,RYAN>from where the microchip was stolen.

380
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:09,060
<14-1,RYAN>这就是维克多  就在行窃发生前
<14-1,RYAN>That is Victor right before the burglary.

381
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,390
<14-1,RYAN>还有一个人跟他一起
<14-1,RYAN>And there's someone with him.

382
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,360
<14-2,ESPOSITO>肯定是他搭档  有更清楚的画面吗
<14-2,ESPOSITO>Must be a partner. Is there a better look?

383
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,090
<14-3,RYAN>没有
<14-3,RYAN>Nope.

384
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:14,890
<14-4,ESPOSITO>那个人会不会是斯勒特
<14-4,ESPOSITO>What if that's Slaughter?

385
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:16,730
<14-4,ESPOSITO>我跟他的警监谈过
<14-4,ESPOSITO>I spoke to his captain.

386
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,570
<14-4,ESPOSITO>斯勒特被调出了黑帮组
<14-4,ESPOSITO>Slaughter was reassigned from gangs

387
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:19,730
<14-4,ESPOSITO>因为有个毒贩指控他
<14-4,ESPOSITO>because a dealer accused him

388
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:21,940
<14-4,ESPOSITO>在一次突袭时中饱私囊了两万块钱
<14-4,ESPOSITO>of pocketing 20k during a drug bust.

389
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:24,320
<14-4,ESPOSITO>据说  斯勒特就要被停职了
<14-4,ESPOSITO>Word is, Slaughter was about to be suspended --

390
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,160
<14-4,ESPOSITO>很有可能被开除
<14-4,ESPOSITO>quite possibly kicked off the job.

391
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,600
<14-5,RYAN>也就意味着拿不到退休金了
<14-5,RYAN>Which means "Bye-bye, pension."

392
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,840
<14-6,ESPOSITO>偷这个芯片
<14-6,ESPOSITO>The microchip burglary

393
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,700
<14-6,ESPOSITO>可能就是斯勒特为退休做的打算
<14-6,ESPOSITO>might have been Slaughter's retirement plan.

394
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,370
<14-7,RYAN>如果维克多想要出卖他
<14-7,RYAN>And if Victor tried to double-cross him...

395
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:33,560
<14-8,ESPOSITO>斯勒特会干掉他
<14-8,ESPOSITO>Slaughter would have put him down.

396
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:36,400
<14-9,RYAN>可是为什么要把卡塞尔牵扯进来呢
<14-9,RYAN>But why involve Castle in all of this?

397
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:39,510
<14-10,ESPOSITO>可能维克多在死前把芯片藏起来了
<14-10,ESPOSITO>Maybe Victor hid the microchip before he died.

398
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:40,660
<14-10,ESPOSITO>斯勒特找不到
<14-10,ESPOSITO>Slaughter couldn't find it.

399
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,400
<14-10,ESPOSITO>所以他想骗卡塞尔
<14-10,ESPOSITO>And so he thought he could fool Castle

400
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,070
<14-10,ESPOSITO>用他特别的大脑来帮忙找出来
<14-10,ESPOSITO>into using his unique brain to help him find it.

401
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:46,180
<14-11,RYAN>幸运的是
<14-11,RYAN>Well, it's a good thing

402
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:48,100
<14-11,RYAN>卡塞尔不至于那么笨相信他
<14-11,RYAN>Castle's not dumb enough to fall for that.

403
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,250
<15-1,SLAUGHTER>你觉得芯片会在哪
<15-1,SLAUGHTER>So, where do you think the chip is?

404
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,860
<15-2,CASTLE>如果维克多的搭档没有把它买给特鲁科
<15-2,CASTLE>If Victor's partner didn't sell it to Trucco,

405
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,020
<15-2,CASTLE>那有可能还在他那里
<15-2,CASTLE>then they probably still have it.

406
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:57,920
<15-3,SLAUGHTER>这位天才是谁
<15-3,SLAUGHTER>Who's the talent?

408
00:15:58,590 --> 00:15:59,880
<15-4,CASTLE>斯勒特  这位是海莉
<15-4,CASTLE>Slaughter, this is Hayley.

409
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,430
<15-6,SLAUGHTER>怪不得你对那个慕男狂室友没兴趣呢
<15-6,SLAUGHTER>No wonder you weren't interested in that nympho roommate?

410
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,560
<15-7,HAYLEY>什么意思
<15-7,HAYLEY>I'm sorry -- what?

411
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:05,920
<15-8,CASTLE>没什么
<15-8,CASTLE>Just... forget it.

412
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,280
<15-8,CASTLE>海莉刚开始跟我合作  是我的顾问
<15-8,CASTLE>Hayley just started working with me as a consultant.

413
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:10,350
<15-9,HAYLEY>是的  里克之前让我
<15-9,HAYLEY>Yes, Rick has asked me

414
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:12,290
<15-9,HAYLEY>调查一下布斯塔的入室盗窃案
<15-9,HAYLEY>to suss out the break-in at Booth Tower.

415
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,680
<15-10,SLAUGHTER>英式英语  很性感
<15-10,SLAUGHTER>Oh, and she speaks British. That's hot.

416
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,040
<15-11,HAYLEY>每次认识你的朋友总是很愉快  里克
<15-11,HAYLEY>It's always a pleasure meeting one of your friends, Rick.

417
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,730
<15-12,CASTLE>他真的不是...  你就无视他吧
<15-12,CASTLE>He's really not... just... please ignore him.

418
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:21,780
<15-12,CASTLE>你查到什么了吗
<15-12,CASTLE>Did you find anything?

419
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:22,940
<15-12,CASTLE>当然了
<15-12,CASTLE>Of course I did.

420
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:25,290
<15-13,HAYLEY>布斯塔的安保系统
<15-13,HAYLEY>So, the security system at Booth Tower

421
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:26,560
<15-13,HAYLEY>非常地先进
<15-13,HAYLEY>is definitely cutting-edge.

422
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:29,070
<15-13,HAYLEY>需要天才级的数字锁专家
<15-13,HAYLEY>It would have taken a genius-level digital locksmith

423
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:31,130
<15-13,HAYLEY>才能攻破一层层的警报系统
<15-13,HAYLEY>to get through the several layers of the alarm system.

424
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:31,780
<15-14,SLAUGHTER>天才
<15-14,SLAUGHTER>Genius.

425
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:34,270
<15-14,SLAUGHTER>维克多或者他的那群朋友都不是天才
<15-14,SLAUGHTER>That sure as hell ain't Victor or anyone he hangs with.

426
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,380
<15-14,SLAUGHTER>你确定吗
<15-14,SLAUGHTER>You sure about that?

427
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:36,450
<15-15,HAYLEY>我调查了一下
<15-15,HAYLEY>'Cause I did some digging,

428
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:38,760
<15-15,HAYLEY>维克多之前主动为一个16岁的
<15-15,HAYLEY>and it turns out that Victor volunteered as a mentor

429
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,700
<15-15,HAYLEY>名叫路易斯·普林斯的穷苦孩子
<15-15,HAYLEY>to an underprivileged 16-year-old boy

430
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,700
<16-17,RYAN>当导师
<16-17,RYAN>named Louis Prince.

431
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,390
<15-14,SLAUGHTER>我黑进了路易斯的档案
<15-14,SLAUGHTER>Now, I hacked Louis' records,

432
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:46,330
<15-15,HAYLEY>他有很多次暴力犯罪记录
<15-15,HAYLEY>and he has quite the history of violence.

433
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:49,740
<15-15,HAYLEY>还被关进过少管所很多次
<15-15,HAYLEY>Turns out he's been in and out of several juvenile detention facilities,

434
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,190
<15-15,HAYLEY>而且还被四所高中都开除了
<15-15,HAYLEY>and he was kicked out of four high schools.

435
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:53,230
<15-16,SLAUGHTER>我觉得这孩子不怎么聪明
<15-16,SLAUGHTER>Doesn't sound too smart to me.

437
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,550
<15-17,CASTLE>那是他的智商吗
<15-17,CASTLE>Is that his I.Q.?

438
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:58,650
<15-18,HAYLEY>是的  190
<15-18,HAYLEY>Oh, yes -- 190.

439
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:01,170
<15-19,SLAUGHTER>这是个罪犯版的《心灵捕手》吗
<15-19,SLAUGHTER>It's like a criminal Good Will Hunting?

440
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,380
<15-19,SLAUGHTER>是的
<15-19,SLAUGHTER>Yeah.

441
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,000
<15-20,CASTLE>而且他好像已经上升到杀人的地步了
<15-20,CASTLE>And it looks like he's graduated to murder.

442
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,860
<16-1,MARK WEST>路易斯的生活很不幸
<16-1,MARK WEST>Louis had a rough life.

443
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:11,930
<16-1,MARK WEST>他五岁的时候被父亲抛弃
<16-1,MARK WEST>He was abandoned by his father when he was 5,

444
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:13,250
<16-1,MARK WEST>由母亲抚养长大
<16-1,MARK WEST>and then he was raised by his mother,

445
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,080
<16-1,MARK WEST>为了养活他  他母亲打了两份工
<16-1,MARK WEST>who has to work two jobs to support him.

446
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,590
<16-1,MARK WEST>所以这孩子一天有20个小时都是自己生活
<16-1,MARK WEST>Kid was on his own 20 hours a day.

447
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:18,610
<16-2,SLAUGHTER>不是所有的留守儿童都成了杀人凶手
<16-2,SLAUGHTER>Not all latchkey kids wind up killers.

448
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:21,170
<16-3,CASTLE>是的  他们也不都像爱因斯坦那么聪明
<16-3,CASTLE>Yeah, they're not all Einstein-level geniuses, either.

449
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:24,170
<16-4,WEST>说实话  路易斯简直太聪明了
<16-4,WEST>Louis was -- honestly was just too smart.

450
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:26,580
<16-4,WEST>而且也没人告诉他该怎么培养自己的天赋
<16-4,WEST>And he didn't have anyone to help nurture his talents,

451
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:29,530
<16-4,WEST>所以他就胡作非为
<16-4,WEST>so all he could do was lash out.

452
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:31,830
<16-4,WEST>那时我第一次见到了他
<16-4,WEST>That's when I first met him.

453
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,340
<16-4,WEST>我当时立刻就意识到他是导师行动的
<16-4,WEST>I knew right away he was the perfect candidate

454
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,400
<16-4,WEST>最佳人选
<16-4,WEST>for Operation Mentor.

455
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,570
<16-4,WEST>而他最需要的就是一个
<16-4,WEST>What he needed more than anything

456
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,890
<16-4,WEST>强大的男性榜样来照看他
<16-4,WEST>was a strong male role model to look out for him.

457
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:40,610
<16-5,SLAUGHTER>-也就是维克多  -最后才是他
<16-5,SLAUGHTER>- That was Victor. - Eventually, yes,

458
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:42,840
<16-6,WEST>路易斯之前接触过五个导师
<16-6,WEST>But Louis went through five other mentors first.

459
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,170
<16-6,WEST>我顶着很大压力没让他出局
<16-6,WEST>I got a lot of pressure to kick him out of the program.

460
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,420
<16-6,WEST>维克多是我最后的希望
<16-6,WEST>Victor was my last shot,

461
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,770
<16-6,WEST>不过他们一见面就非常合得来
<16-6,WEST>but they hit it off right away,

462
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:49,010
<16-6,WEST>而且路易斯也开始慢慢变好
<16-6,WEST>and Louis started getting better.

463
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:52,170
<16-6,WEST>警探  其实你应该考虑当导师
<16-6,WEST>You know, detective, you should consider becoming a mentor.

464
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,990
<16-7,SLAUGHTER>我可不是什么当榜样的材料
<16-7,SLAUGHTER>Yeah, I'm not role-model material.

465
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,050
<16-8,CASTLE>真的不是
<16-8,CASTLE>He's really not.

466
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:00,630
<16-9,WEST>谁也说不好  我也不是一直做顾问
<16-9,WEST>You never know. I wasn't always a counselor.

467
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:02,870
<16-9,WEST>我以前为了赚钱在华尔街每天工作15小时
<16-9,WEST>I used to chase money around Wall Street for 15 hours a day,

468
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:05,630
<16-9,WEST>可来到这里  更适合我
<16-9,WEST>But this here -- this is definitely more fulfilling.

469
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:06,810
<16-10,CASTLE>是的  我想也是
<16-10,CASTLE>Yes, I imagine so.

470
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:10,320
<16-10,CASTLE>如果维克多想利用路易斯的天赋
<16-10,CASTLE>Now, if Victor were to use Louis' genius

471
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:12,580
<16-10,CASTLE>来帮他犯罪  这样就是
<16-10,CASTLE>to help commit a crime, that would have been

472
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:14,250
<16-10,CASTLE>完全背叛了他的信任  对吧
<16-10,CASTLE>quite a betrayal of trust, wouldn't it?

473
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,140
<16-11,SLAUGHTER>是否足以让他爆发然后杀了他的导师呢
<16-11,SLAUGHTER>Enough to make him snap and kill his mentor?

474
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:19,340
<16-12,WEST>除了路易斯的妈妈  维克多是第一个能够取得
<16-12,WEST>Well, Victor was the first person that Louis ever trusted,

475
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,280
<16-12,WEST>他信任的人
<16-12,WEST>besides his mom,

476
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,370
<16-12,WEST>所以如果发现维克多背叛了他
<16-12,WEST>So finding out he'd been betrayed

477
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:24,270
<16-12,WEST>他会感到非常绝望的
<16-12,WEST>would have been pretty devastating.

478
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:28,060
<16-13,SLAUGHTER>知道路易斯会藏在哪里吗
<16-13,SLAUGHTER>Any idea where Louis might be hiding?

479
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,220
<16-14,WEST>我不知道  抱歉
<16-14,WEST>I don't know. Sorry.

480
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,150
<16-15,CASTLE>谢谢你的配合  韦斯特先生
<16-15,CASTLE>Thank you very much for your time, Mr. West.

00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:33,850
<16-15,CASTLE>我们得走了
<16-15,CASTLE>W- we got to go -- now.

<16-16,SLAUGHTER>Yeah, thanks.

483
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,720
<16-16,SLAUGHTER>韦斯特先生  我是莱恩警探
<16-16,SLAUGHTER>Mr. West. I'm Detective Ryan.

484
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,920
<16-17,RYAN>这位是埃斯波西托警探  纽约警局的
<16-17,RYAN>This is Detective Esposito. NYPD.

485
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,650
<16-17,RYAN>我们想问一些有关路易斯·普林斯的问题
<16-17,RYAN>We just have a few questions about a kid

486
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:54,200
<16-17,RYAN>他的导师是维克多·李
<16-17,RYAN>that Victor Lee was mentoring named Louis Prince.

487
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,920
<16-18,ESPOSITO>他可能知道一些信息
<16-18,ESPOSITO>It's possible he might have some information

488
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,290
<16-18,ESPOSITO>能帮我们破一个案子
<16-18,ESPOSITO>that can help us solve a crime.

489
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:58,630
<16-19,WEST>真有意思  有两个警察
<16-19,WEST>That's funny -- you guys just missed

490
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,730
<16-19,WEST>刚刚离开这里
<16-19,WEST>the two other cops that were here.

491
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:01,110
<16-19,WEST>他们也来问路易斯的事
<16-19,WEST>They were asking about Louis, too.

492
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,330
<17-1,CASTLE>好的  知道了
<17-1,CASTLE>Yes. Got it.

493
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:07,630
<17-1,CASTLE>海莉利用路易斯电脑的IP地址
<17-1,CASTLE>Hayley managed to track Louis down

494
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:08,980
<17-1,CASTLE>找到了他的行踪
<17-1,CASTLE>using the I.P. address on his computer.

495
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:09,960
<17-1,CASTLE>我知道地址了
<17-1,CASTLE>I have an address.

496
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,830
<17-1,CASTLE>非常感谢你  海莉
<17-1,CASTLE>Thank you very much for doing this, Hayley.

497
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:13,610
<17-1,CASTLE>我有电话打进来了  谢谢
<17-1,CASTLE>I- I have another call. Thanks.

498
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:15,490
<17-1,CASTLE>我是卡塞尔
<17-1,CASTLE>This is Castle.

499
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:16,730
<17-2,RYAN>你骗了我们
<17-2,RYAN>You lied to us?

500
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,330
<17-3,CASTLE>要是这么说的话...
<17-3,CASTLE>Well, when you put it that way...

501
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:21,200
<17-4,RYAN>卡塞尔  我不是跟你开玩笑
<17-4,RYAN>Castle, no. This is not funny.

502
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,370
<17-4,RYAN>你跟谋杀案嫌犯混在一起干什么
<17-4,RYAN>What are you doing running around with our murder suspect?

503
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,390
<17-5,CASTLE>斯勒特没杀人  好吧
<17-5,CASTLE>Hey, Slaughter didn't kill anyone, all right?

504
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:26,040
<17-5,CASTLE>我向你们保证
<17-5,CASTLE>I promise you.

505
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,240
<17-5,CASTLE>他和我们一样想找到杀维克多的凶手
<17-5,CASTLE>He wants to find Victor's killer just as much as we do.

506
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,920
<17-6,RYAN>是吗  他跟你说了为什么不在罪案组了吗
<17-6,RYAN>Really? Did he tell you why he's not working gangs anymore?

507
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,430
<17-7,CASTLE>是的  他说太无聊了
<17-7,CASTLE>Yes -- he said he got bored.

508
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:34,030
<17-8,RYAN>不  他是被降职了
<17-8,RYAN>No. He got demoted.

509
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:37,220
<17-8,RYAN>他因为抢了毒贩的钱正在接受调查
<17-8,RYAN>He's under investigation for robbing a drug dealer.

510
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:39,340
<17-9,CASTLE>你抢了毒贩的钱吗
<17-9,CASTLE>You robbed a drug dealer?

511
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,630
<17-10,SLAUGHTER>没有  那个指控简直是扯淡
<17-10,SLAUGHTER>Oh, hell no. That's a B.S. charge.

512
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:43,340
<17-11,RYAN>斯勒特就要失去退休金了  卡塞尔
<17-11,RYAN>Slaughter's about to lose his pension, Castle.

513
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,770
<17-11,RYAN>我们认为他是跟维克多合伙去偷那个芯片
<17-11,RYAN>We figure that he teamed up with Victor to steal that chip,

514
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:46,980
<17-11,RYAN>然后他想独吞
<17-11,RYAN>and then he got greedy.

515
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:48,740
<17-11,RYAN>把电话给我
<17-11,RYAN>Give me that.

516
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,460
<17-12,SLAUGHTER>警探  少管闲事
<17-12,SLAUGHTER>Hey, detective, get your head out of our butt!

517
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:53,680
<17-12,SLAUGHTER>是的  我的确是修理了一下维克多
<17-12,SLAUGHTER>Yeah, sure, I might have tuned Victor up a little bit,

518
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,730
<17-12,SLAUGHTER>不过我没杀他
<17-12,SLAUGHTER>but I didn't kill him.

519
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,690
<17-12,SLAUGHTER>你们查我就是在浪费时间
<17-12,SLAUGHTER>You're wasting your time chasing after me.

520
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:58,110
<17-12,SLAUGHTER>你们应该去找那个孩子
<17-12,SLAUGHTER>You should be after the kid.

521
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,400
<17-13,RYAN>喂
<17-13,RYAN>Hello?

522
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:04,710
<17-14,CASTLE>你知道把SIM卡拿出来就行了  对吧
<17-14,CASTLE>You know you can just take the S.I.M. card out, right?

523
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,320
<17-14,CASTLE>干这行后我丢的手机更多了
<17-14,CASTLE>I lose more phones in this line of work.

524
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:16,520
<18-1,CASTLE>如果我想退出  你会同意的  对吧
<18-1,CASTLE>If I wanted to just walk away, you would let me, right?

525
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,670
<18-2,SLAUGHTER>不想干了吗
<18-2,SLAUGHTER>Having second thoughts?

526
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:19,660
<18-3,CASTLE>鉴于以前的事  我觉得这合情合理
<18-3,CASTLE>I think that's reasonable, given your history.

527
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:21,510
<18-4,SLAUGHTER>你是指咱俩以前的事
<18-4,SLAUGHTER>You mean given our history.

528
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:28,150
<18-5,SLAUGHTER>不许动
<18-5,SLAUGHTER>Freeze!

529
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:32,830
<18-6,SLAUGHTER>陪着这孩子  大侦探
<18-6,SLAUGHTER>Stay with the kid, Sherlock.

530
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,880
<18-7,CASTLE>别紧张  别紧张  我们是来帮你的
<18-7,CASTLE>Relax, relax. We're not here to hurt you.

531
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:37,450
<18-8,LOUIS>求你了  求你离我远点
<18-8,LOUIS>Please. Please stay away from me.

532
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:48,020
<19-1,SLAUGHTER>过来
<19-1,SLAUGHTER>Come here.

533
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,380
<19-1,SLAUGHTER>没事了
<19-1,SLAUGHTER>You're okay. Come on.

534
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:53,100
<20-1,CASTLE>我们正试图弄清楚维克多出了什么事
<20-1,CASTLE>We're just trying to figure out what happened to Victor.

535
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,570
<20-2,LOUIS>我没杀他  我发誓
<20-2,LOUIS>I didn't kill him. I swear.

536
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:00,970
<20-3,CASTLE>没人说是你干的
<20-3,CASTLE>No one's saying you did.

537
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:05,400
<20-4,CASTLE>不是吧
<20-4,CASTLE>Really?!

538
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,440
<20-4,CASTLE>觉得有点丢脸了吧
<20-4,CASTLE>Not your proudest moment, huh?

539
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,470
<21-1,SLAUGHTER>我认为不是他干的
<21-1,SLAUGHTER>I don't think he did it.

540
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:20,540
<21-2,CASTLE>当然是他干的
<21-2,CASTLE>Sure he did.

541
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,250
<21-3,SLAUGHTER>你没看到他的表情
<21-3,SLAUGHTER>You didn't see his face.

542
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:25,040
<21-4,CASTLE>他很害怕  他还这么年轻
<21-4,CASTLE>He was scared and young.

543
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,850
<21-4,CASTLE>那不是一个凶手会有的神情
<21-4,CASTLE>It's not the face of a killer.

544
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:30,860
<21-5,SLAUGHTER>到危急关头时我们都是凶手  卡塞尔
<21-5,SLAUGHTER>We're all killers, Castle, when push comes to shove.

545
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:31,690
<21-5,SLAUGHTER>走
<21-5,SLAUGHTER>Come on.

546
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:37,100
<22-1,SLAUGHTER>我还需要表现得和善吗
<22-1,SLAUGHTER>Do I still have to play nice?

547
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:38,920
<22-2,CASTLE>不用了
<22-2,CASTLE>No.

548
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,130
<22-2,CASTLE>很好
<22-2,CASTLE>Good.

549
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,110
<22-3,SLAUGHTER>现在你告诉我们你来这干什么
<22-3,SLAUGHTER>Now, you're gonna tell me what you're doing here,

550
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:45,250
<22-3,SLAUGHTER>否则我会把你老二像拉链一样  拉到你下巴
<22-3,SLAUGHTER>or I'm gonna pull your dipstick up to your chin like a zipper.

551
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,830
<22-4,EDDIE>我为那小子来的
<22-4,EDDIE>Okay, I came for the kid.

552
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:47,660
<22-5,CASTLE>为什么
<22-5,CASTLE>Why?

553
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:49,120
<22-6,EDDIE>因为他是关键人物
<22-6,EDDIE>'Cause he's the key.

554
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,520
<22-7,SLAUGHTER>-我要开始拉了  -不  等等
<22-7,SLAUGHTER>- I'm gonna start zipping. - No, wait!

555
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:53,680
<22-8,EDDIE>我在一个专偷高端公司的团伙混
<22-8,EDDIE>Look, I work for a crew that specializes in high-end B&Es,

556
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,380
<22-8,EDDIE>老板叫大卫·雷西
<22-8,EDDIE>run by a guy named David Lacey.

557
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:56,950
<22-9,SLAUGHTER>我知道雷西
<22-9,SLAUGHTER>Ugh. I know Lacey.

558
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:58,940
<22-9,SLAUGHTER>他坏了反社会人士的名声
<22-9,SLAUGHTER>He gives sociopaths a bad name.

559
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,810
<22-10,CASTLE>你们帮维克多偷微芯片吗
<22-10,CASTLE>So you guys helped Victor steal the microchip?

560
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:01,360
<22-11,EDDIE>不是
<22-11,EDDIE>No.

561
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,410
<22-12,SLAUGHTER>他开始侮辱我们的智商了
<22-12,SLAUGHTER>See, now he's insulting our intelligence.

562
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:05,560
<22-12,SLAUGHTER>把浴帘拿来
<22-12,SLAUGHTER>Go get the shower curtain.

563
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,470
<22-12,SLAUGHTER>这会弄得一滩血的
<22-12,SLAUGHTER>This is gonna get a little messy.

564
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:07,570
<22-12,SLAUGHTER>别  是真的
<22-12,SLAUGHTER>No, no, it's true!

565
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:11,310
<22-13,EDDIE>维克多和那小子独自完成了微芯片的盗窃
<22-13,EDDIE>Victor and the kid pulled off the microchip job alone --

566
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:12,590
<22-13,EDDIE>为了传递一个信息
<22-13,EDDIE>to send a message.

567
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:13,790
<22-14,CASTLE>什么样的信息
<22-14,CASTLE>What kind of message?

568
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,340
<22-15,EDDIE>维克多四处散播
<22-15,EDDIE>Victor was going around town

569
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:17,710
<22-15,EDDIE>说他有可以开启任何锁的钥匙
<22-15,EDDIE>boasting that he had the key to any lock.

570
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:18,830
<22-16,CASTLE>是指路易斯吗
<22-16,CASTLE>Meaning Louis?

571
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:22,100
<22-17,EDDIE>那孩子发明了一种可以使任何警报器失效的系统
<22-17,EDDIE>The kid invented a device that could disarm any alarm system,

572
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,330
<22-17,EDDIE>不管多复杂都可以
<22-17,EDDIE>no matter how complex.

573
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:25,900
<22-17,EDDIE>闯入布斯塔是为了引起世人关注
<22-17,EDDIE>So breaking into the Booth Tower put the town on notice

574
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:28,600
<22-17,EDDIE>维克多的装置就可以招来出价更高的买家
<22-17,EDDIE>that Victor's services were available to the highest bidder.

575
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,790
<22-18,CASTLE>维克多在利用路易斯
<22-18,CASTLE>So Victor was using Louis.

576
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,490
<22-18,CASTLE>可是你的老板雷西
<22-18,CASTLE>Only your boss, Lacey,

577
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:34,390
<22-18,CASTLE>没兴趣跟维克多讨价还价
<22-18,CASTLE>wasn't interested in paying Victor's price.

578
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:36,340
<22-18,CASTLE>于是维克多一死  你来这
<22-18,CASTLE>So Victor ends up dead, you come here,

579
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,990
<22-18,CASTLE>免费带走这个孩子
<22-18,CASTLE>pick up the kid free of charge.

580
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:39,440
<22-18,CASTLE>斯勒特
<22-18,CASTLE>Slaughter!

581
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:40,990
<22-19,RYAN>把手举起来
<22-19,RYAN>Put your hands up right now.

582
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,390
<22-20,ESPOSITO>马上
<22-20,ESPOSITO>Do it -- now.

583
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:50,720
<22-21,SLAUGHTER>小心点  我的武器可比你的火力猛
<22-21,SLAUGHTER>Easy with that. It's a little more weapon than you're used to.

584
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:51,360
<22-22,RYAN>是啊
<22-22,RYAN>Yeah.

585
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,870
<22-23,ESPOSITO>你有权利保持缄默
<22-23,ESPOSITO>You have the right to remain silent.

586
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:55,630
<22-24,SLAUGHTER>是啊  知道  早就听说过了
<22-24,SLAUGHTER>Yeah, yeah, yeah. Heard it all before.

587
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:58,800
<23-1,RYAN>需要再来一队人押送另一个嫌犯
<23-1,RYAN>We're gonna need another unit to transport a second suspect.

588
00:22:58,850 --> 00:22:59,710
<23-1,RYAN>谢谢你
<23-1,RYAN>Thank you.

589
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:03,140
<23-2,CASTLE>埃斯波  他没杀维克多
<23-2,CASTLE>Espo. Espo. He didn't kill Victor.

590
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:05,850
<23-2,CASTLE>如果我的直觉正确的话  也不是路易斯干的
<23-2,CASTLE>And if my instincts are right, neither did Louis,

591
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:08,400
<23-2,CASTLE>那就意味着一个16岁的孩子独自在外面
<23-2,CASTLE>which means there is a 16-year-old kid out there alone

592
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,500
<23-2,CASTLE>一群非常危险的人在追踪他
<23-2,CASTLE>with a very dangerous crew after him.

593
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,580
<23-2,CASTLE>我们需要调集全部人手来寻找他
<23-2,CASTLE>We're gonna need all hands on deck to find him.

594
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,630
<23-3,ESPOSITO>那是不可能的  卡塞尔
<23-3,ESPOSITO>It's not gonna happen, Castle.

595
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,210
<23-3,ESPOSITO>-斯勒特跑不掉了  -可他们
<23-3,ESPOSITO>- Slaughter's going in. - But they --

596
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:17,890
<23-5,ESPOSITO>你该庆幸我没以协助教唆罪
<23-5,ESPOSITO>And you're lucky I don't arrest you, too,

597
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:19,000
<23-5,ESPOSITO>把你也一起抓起来
<23-5,ESPOSITO>for aiding and abetting.

598
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:20,860
<23-6,CASTLE>-埃斯波  求你了  -不行  卡塞尔
<23-6,CASTLE>- Espo, please. - No, Castle.

599
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:22,490
<23-7,ESPOSITO>我不会改变主意的
<23-7,ESPOSITO>I'm not changing my mind on this.

600
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,720
<23-7,ESPOSITO>莱恩
<23-7,ESPOSITO>Ryan.

601
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,070
<23-7,ESPOSITO>莱恩  另一组人到哪了
<23-7,ESPOSITO>Ryan, where are we with that other unit?

602
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,400
<23-8,ESPOSITO>-搞什么  -对不起
<23-8,ESPOSITO>- What the hell? - I'm sorry. I'm s--

603
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:32,120
<23-9,CASTLE>对不起  我不该那样做的
<23-9,CASTLE>I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done that.

604
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,060
<23-10,RYAN>刚才发生了什么
<23-10,RYAN>What just happened?

605
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:49,710
<23-11,ESPOSITO>卡塞尔偷走了我们的嫌犯
<23-11,ESPOSITO>Castle just stole our murder suspect.

606
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,210
<23-11,ESPOSITO>还有我们的车
<23-11,ESPOSITO>And our car.

607
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,770
<23-12,ESPOSITO>-你笑什么  -你笑什么
<23-12,ESPOSITO>- What are you laughing at? - What are you laughing at?

608
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,030
<24-1,RYAN>哈维  我想他们知道了
<24-1,RYAN>Javi, I think they know.

609
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,320
<24-1,RYAN>他们不知道
<24-1,RYAN>They don't know.

610
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:11,330
<24-2,ESPOSITO>不  巡逻队的人完全相信了
<24-2,ESPOSITO>No, that patrol unit totally bought our story

611
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:12,760
<24-2,ESPOSITO>我们说车出故障了的说辞
<24-2,ESPOSITO>about our car breaking down.

612
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:15,170
<24-2,ESPOSITO>把他关起来
<24-2,ESPOSITO>Yo. Take him to holding.

613
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:16,410
<24-2,ESPOSITO>过来
<24-2,ESPOSITO>Hey. Come here.

614
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,320
<24-3,RYAN>可如果下班时
<24-3,RYAN>What happens when we don't get the

615
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,320
<24-3,RYAN>车还送不到调配场怎么办
<24-3,RYAN>car back to the motor pool at the end of our shift?

616
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,450
<24-3,RYAN>我觉得该给贝克特打电话
<24-3,RYAN>I think we should call Beckett.

617
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:27,580
<24-4,ESPOSITO>说什么  说她丈夫
<24-4,ESPOSITO>And tell her what -- that her husband

618
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:29,350
<24-4,ESPOSITO>在我们鼻子底下把越狱犯带走了吗
<24-4,ESPOSITO>staged a jailbreak right under our noses?

619
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,580
<24-5,RYAN>其实是在你鼻子底下
<24-5,RYAN>Well, technically, your nose.

620
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,070
<24-5,RYAN>但那  那不是重点
<24-5,RYAN>But that -- that's not the point.

621
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,330
<24-5,RYAN>我们必须找到卡塞尔和斯勒特
<24-5,RYAN>We just need to find Castle and Slaughter.

622
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,600
<25-1,SLAUGHTER>在想好下一步该怎么办之前待在这里很安全
<25-1,SLAUGHTER>We'll be safe here till we figure out our next move.

623
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:43,840
<25-2,CASTLE>这不可能是你家吧
<25-2,CASTLE>This can't be your place.

624
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,510
<25-3,SLAUGHTER>为什么不能是
<25-3,SLAUGHTER>Why not?

625
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:48,460
<25-4,CASTLE>两个原因  第一  我们都是逃犯
<25-4,CASTLE>Two reasons -- one, we're both fugitives.

626
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:49,760
<25-4,CASTLE>藏身于我们任何一个人的家中
<25-4,CASTLE>Hiding at either of our apartments

627
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,670
<25-4,CASTLE>都是个糟糕的主意
<25-4,CASTLE>would be a terrible idea.

628
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:54,280
<25-4,CASTLE>第二  我以为你家里会更《枪与弹药》风
<25-4,CASTLE>Two, I picture your decor less architectural digest,

629
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,260
<25-4,CASTLE>而不是《建筑文摘》风
<25-4,CASTLE>more guns & ammo.

630
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:59,520
<25-5,SLAUGHTER>是我前妻的家  她出城了
<25-5,SLAUGHTER>It's my ex-wife's. She's, uh, out of town.

631
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,770
<25-6,CASTLE>我不知道你结过婚  她叫什么
<25-6,CASTLE>I had no idea you were married. What's her name?

632
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,360
<25-7,SLAUGHTER>麦迪
<25-7,SLAUGHTER>Maddie.

633
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,140
<25-8,CASTLE>我猜麦迪很喜欢看歌剧
<25-8,CASTLE>And I take it Maddie's a fan of the opera?

634
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:11,510
<25-9,SLAUGHTER>她是纽约歌剧院的女中音
<25-9,SLAUGHTER>She's a mezzo-soprano at the New York City Opera.

635
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,910
<25-10,CASTLE>你是说麦迪是玛德琳·科尔黛
<25-10,CASTLE>I'm sorry -- "Maddie," as in Madeleine Corday?

636
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:18,450
<25-11,SLAUGHTER>我看过她的表演
<25-11,SLAUGHTER>I've seen her perform.

637
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:20,900
<25-12,CASTLE>她  她简直太棒了
<25-12,CASTLE>She -- she's an absolute revelation.

638
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,270
<25-12,CASTLE>我只是无法想象她...
<25-12,CASTLE>I just can't picture her...

639
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:26,210
<25-12,CASTLE>跟你在一起
<25-12,CASTLE>...with you.

640
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,690
<25-12,CASTLE>你们是怎么认识的
<25-12,CASTLE>How did you even meet her?

641
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,810
<25-13,SLAUGHTER>大学
<25-13,SLAUGHTER>College.

642
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,370
<25-13,SLAUGHTER>我们俩一个专业
<25-13,SLAUGHTER>We had the same maj--

643
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:34,710
<25-14,CASTLE>你的专业是歌剧演唱吗
<25-14,CASTLE>You majored in opera singing?

644
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:35,450
<25-14,CASTLE>不是
<25-14,CASTLE>No.

645
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:37,730
<25-15,SLAUGHTER>音乐剧表演
<25-15,SLAUGHTER>Musical theater.

646
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:40,820
<25-16,CASTLE>-你吗  -是的
<25-16,CASTLE>- You? - Yeah.

647
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:42,770
<25-17,SLAUGHTER>如果你敢告诉别人
<25-17,SLAUGHTER>And if you tell anyone,

648
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:45,690
<25-17,SLAUGHTER>我就把你的脾塞到你鼻子里
<25-17,SLAUGHTER>I'm gonna force-feed you your spleen through your nose.

649
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,960
<25-18,CASTLE>对不起  我尽量表现得害怕来着
<25-18,CASTLE>Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm trying to be scared.

650
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,980
<25-18,CASTLE>只是我还在想象你摆爵士手造型
<25-18,CASTLE>I just keep picturing you doing jazz hands.

651
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,630
<26-1,ESPOSITO>卡塞尔在哪
<26-1,ESPOSITO>Where's Castle?

652
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:57,040
<26-2,ALEXIS>不知道
<26-2,ALEXIS>I have no idea.

653
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:59,010
<26-3,ESPOSITO>别骗我们  我们没心情跟你闹
<26-3,ESPOSITO>Don't lie to us. We're not in the mood.

654
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:00,640
<26-4,RYAN>是啊  我们不得不打私家车来
<26-4,RYAN>Yeah, we had to Uber here.

655
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:02,340
<26-5,HAYLEY>什么  你们的车呢
<26-5,HAYLEY>What? Where's your car?

656
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,790
<26-6,ESPOSITO>那不重要
<26-6,ESPOSITO>That's... not important.

657
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:06,370
<26-6,ESPOSITO>重要的是我们必须要找到他  立即马上
<26-6,ESPOSITO>What is important is that we need to find him -- now.

658
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:07,970
<26-7,HAYLEY>我们已经几个小时没见到他了
<26-7,HAYLEY>Well, we haven't seen him for hours.

659
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:09,250
<26-7,HAYLEY>出什么事了
<26-7,HAYLEY>What's going on?

660
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,190
<26-8,RYAN>我们逮捕斯勒特后  卡塞尔偷了我们的车
<26-8,RYAN>Castle stole our car after we arrested Slaughter.

661
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,750
<26-8,RYAN>真抱歉
<26-8,RYAN>I-I'm sorry.

662
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:18,390
<26-9,ALEXIS>那真的不好笑
<26-9,ALEXIS>That's, uh, that's really not funny.

663
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:19,580
<26-10,HAYLEY>真的很好笑啊
<26-10,HAYLEY>It really is, though.

664
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,870
<26-11,ESPOSITO>好了  别笑了
<26-11,ESPOSITO>Okay, knock it off.

665
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,230
<26-12,ALEXIS>等等  你们为什么逮捕斯勒特
<26-12,ALEXIS>But wait, wait. Why did you arrest Slaughter?

666
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:25,220
<26-12,ALEXIS>我爸爸说  他没杀维克多·李
<26-12,ALEXIS>According to dad, he didn't kill Victor Lee.

667
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:27,390
<26-14,HAYLEY>-那不是重点  -那好像就是重点
<26-14,HAYLEY>- That's not the point. - It's kind of the point.

668
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,560
<26-15,ESPOSITO>我们有理由相信
<26-15,ESPOSITO>Look, we had reason to believe

669
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,820
<26-15,ESPOSITO>斯勒特杀了维克多  但是
<26-15,ESPOSITO>that Slaughter killed Victor, but --

670
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,910
<26-16,RYAN>现在我们...  不确定了
<26-16,RYAN>Now we're... not so sure.

671
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:33,870
<26-17,HAYLEY>我可以告诉你们  那个天才少年路易斯
<26-17,HAYLEY>Well, I can tell you this -- that genius kid Louis

672
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:35,470
<26-17,HAYLEY>绝对没杀他
<26-17,HAYLEY>definitely didn't kill him, either.

673
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:36,190
<26-18,RYAN>你怎么知道的
<26-18,RYAN>How do you know that?

674
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:38,490
<26-19,HAYLEY>我帮卡塞尔追踪他的IP地址时
<26-19,HAYLEY>While I was tracking his I.P. address for Castle,

675
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:40,360
<26-19,HAYLEY>注意到在凶案发生的时段里
<26-19,HAYLEY>I noticed that during the time of the murder,

676
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,890
<26-19,HAYLEY>路易斯在布鲁克林的一个咖啡店里
<26-19,HAYLEY>Louis was at a coffee shop in Brooklyn.

677
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:43,490
<26-20,ALEXIS>一个店员记得曾见过他
<26-20,ALEXIS>And a barista remembers seeing him.

678
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:46,150
<26-21,ESPOSITO>也就是说大卫·雷西是我们的头号嫌犯
<26-21,ESPOSITO>Which makes David Lacey our prime suspect.

679
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,720
<26-22,HAYLEY>这个雷西是谁
<26-22,HAYLEY>Who's this Lacey guy?

680
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:50,220
<26-23,ESPOSITO>他操纵一伙劫匪  杀了很多人
<26-23,ESPOSITO>He runs a heist crew -- with a trail of bodies.

681
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,500
<26-23,ESPOSITO>我们抓了他的一个手下  他什么也不肯说
<26-23,ESPOSITO>We've got one of his soldiers in holding, and he's not talking.

682
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:54,660
<26-24,ALEXIS>等等  我爸爸有危险吗
<26-24,ALEXIS>Wait -- is my dad in danger?

683
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:56,790
<26-25,RYAN>我们真的得找到他
<26-25,RYAN>We really need to find him.

684
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:58,010
<26-26,ESPOSITO>尽快
<26-26,ESPOSITO>Fast.

685
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,250
<27-1,SLAUGHTER>味道好极了
<27-1,SLAUGHTER>Yum, yum, yum, yum.

686
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,530
<27-2,SLAUGHTER>来  尝尝这个
<27-2,SLAUGHTER>Here. Try that.

687
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,860
<27-3,CASTLE>-你到底是什么人  -是啊
<27-3,CASTLE>- Who are you? - Yeah.

688
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,890
<27-4,SLAUGHTER>我下厨的时候可以很好地思考
<27-4,SLAUGHTER>I do some of my best thinking when I'm cooking.

689
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:18,260
<27-4,SLAUGHTER>我就是这样度过了离婚的那段日子
<27-4,SLAUGHTER>It's what got me through my divorce.

690
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:20,070
<27-5,CASTLE>你和麦迪出了什么事
<27-5,CASTLE>What happened with you and Maddie?

691
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:22,590
<27-6,SLAUGHTER>她的事业越来越成功
<27-6,SLAUGHTER>Her career took off.

692
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,410
<27-6,SLAUGHTER>而我的一开始就失败了
<27-6,SLAUGHTER>Mine failed to launch.

693
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:25,430
<27-6,SLAUGHTER>我嫉妒了
<27-6,SLAUGHTER>I got jealous.

694
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:26,910
<27-6,SLAUGHTER>从那以后就每况日下
<27-6,SLAUGHTER>Went downhill from there.

695
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,260
<27-6,SLAUGHTER>你和你妻子到底怎么了
<27-6,SLAUGHTER>What really happened with you and your wife?

696
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:31,090
<27-7,CASTLE>我说了  我不知道
<27-7,CASTLE>I told you -- I don't know.

697
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,580
<27-8,SLAUGHTER>你那么聪明  可不该说这样的话  大侦探
<27-8,SLAUGHTER>You're too smart to be talking this stupid, Sherlock.

698
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,690
<27-8,SLAUGHTER>如果你真的爱那个妞
<27-8,SLAUGHTER>If you really love that broad,

699
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:35,750
<27-8,SLAUGHTER>就想办法弄清楚问题在哪
<27-8,SLAUGHTER>you figure out what the problem is,

700
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:36,870
<27-8,SLAUGHTER>然后解决它
<27-8,SLAUGHTER>and you do something.

701
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:41,680
<27-9,CASTLE>是那个孩子
<27-9,CASTLE>Hey, it's the kid!

702
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:43,170
<27-10,LOUIS>老天  怎么又是你
<27-10,LOUIS>Oh, God. Not you again.

703
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:44,850
<27-10,LOUIS>我要找斯勒特警探
<27-10,LOUIS>I'm looking for Detective Slaughter.

704
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:46,140
<27-12,SLAUGHTER>-他在这儿  - 嗨
<27-12,SLAUGHTER>- yeah, he's -- - hey.

705
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:48,890
<27-13,LOUIS>维克多告诉我  如果有麻烦了就来找你
<27-13,LOUIS>Victor told me that if I ever got into trouble to find you.

706
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:50,990
<27-13,LOUIS>他说你能保护我
<27-13,LOUIS>He said that you'd look out for me.

707
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:51,970
<27-13,LOUIS>他是这么说的
<27-13,LOUIS>He did?

708
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,550
<27-14,SLAUGHTER>我是说  是的  我当然会保护你
<27-14,SLAUGHTER>I mean, y-yeah, yeah. 'course I will.

709
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,450
<27-15,CASTLE>等一下  你是怎么找到他的
<27-15,CASTLE>Wait a minute. How did you find him here?

710
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:57,770
<27-16,LOUIS>我  我黑了他的资料
<27-16,LOUIS>I-I hacked his life.

711
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:58,930
<27-17,SLAUGHTER>你干了什么
<27-17,SLAUGHTER>You what my life?

712
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:00,790
<27-18,LOUIS>我做了一个密码生成器
<27-18,LOUIS>I used a cryptographic generator I created

713
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:02,350
<27-18,LOUIS>用它搞到了你的社保号码
<27-18,LOUIS>to get your Social Security number.

714
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,700
<27-18,LOUIS>然后就是简单的推算了
<27-18,LOUIS>After that, it was simple guesswork.

715
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,730
<27-18,LOUIS>我查看了你的信用卡消费记录和银行账户
<27-18,LOUIS>I went through your credit cards, your bank statements,

716
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:07,330
<27-18,LOUIS>我发现你有一个前妻
<27-18,LOUIS>and when I discovered that you had an ex-wife

717
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:09,670
<27-18,LOUIS>她最近在意大利表演
<27-18,LOUIS>who's currently performing in Italy, I found it odd

718
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:12,080
<27-18,LOUIS>奇怪的是她家的警报系统刚刚被关掉了
<27-18,LOUIS>that her home alarm system had recently been disarmed.

719
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,320
<27-18,LOUIS>我破了几道防火墙  查了你前妻的日程表
<27-18,LOUIS>I knocked down a few firewalls, got into your ex's calendar,

720
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,770
<27-18,LOUIS>发现管家周四之前不会过去
<27-18,LOUIS>and discovered the housekeeper doesn't come until Thursday,

721
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:18,620
<27-18,LOUIS>所以我猜一定是你
<27-18,LOUIS>so I assumed it was you.

722
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:21,070
<27-18,LOUIS>我黑了她的电脑IP地址  就这样
<27-18,LOUIS>I hacked her desktop's I.P. Address, and here I am.

723
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:23,200
<27-19,SLAUGHTER>也许我应该叫他"大侦探"
<27-19,SLAUGHTER>Maybe I should be calling him "Sherlock."

724
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,230
<27-20,LOUIS>有人来了
<27-20,LOUIS>Someone's here.

725
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:30,070
<27-21,SLAUGHTER>告诉我们你的位置  然后我要你躲起来
<27-21,SLAUGHTER>Hey, kid, tell us where you are, and then I want you to hide.

726
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:32,160
<27-22,LOUIS>我在  在一个仓库
<27-22,LOUIS>I'm -- I'm in a warehouse --

727
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:35,430
<27-23,SLAUGHTER>该死的  没信号了
<27-23,SLAUGHTER>Damn it. We lost him.

728
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:37,170
<27-24,CASTLE>也许不会  你看那面墙
<27-24,CASTLE>Maybe not. Look at the wall.

729
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,260
<27-25,SLAUGHTER>那是什么
<27-25,SLAUGHTER>What is that?

730
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:43,850
<27-26,CASTLE>蒸汽警告
<27-26,CASTLE>Fumigation notice.

731
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,710
<27-26,CASTLE>而且可以辨认公司的名字
<27-26,CASTLE>And you can just make out the company name

732
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:46,860
<27-26,CASTLE>还有电话号码
<27-26,CASTLE>and the phone number.

733
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:06,720
<28-1,CASTLE>我真的觉得我们应该叫后援
<28-1,CASTLE>I really think we should call for backup.

734
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,850
<28-2,SLAUGHTER>去他的后援  我们走
<28-2,SLAUGHTER>Ah, screw that. Come on.

735
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:22,160
<28-3,SLAUGHTER>我看见那孩子了  他被绑在椅子上
<28-3,SLAUGHTER>I see the kid. He's tied to a chair.

736
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:24,860
<28-3,SLAUGHTER>看起来他在受审问
<28-3,SLAUGHTER>Looks like he's being interrogated.

737
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:25,900
<28-4,CASTLE>有几个人
<28-4,CASTLE>By how many?

738
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:27,440
<28-5,SLAUGHTER>我只看见一个  我们上
<28-5,SLAUGHTER>I only see one. Come on.

739
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,950
<28-6,CASTLE>你连把枪都没有
<28-6,CASTLE>You don't even have a gun.

740
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:32,390
<28-7,SLAUGHTER>只有一个人  走吧
<28-7,SLAUGHTER>It's just one guy. Come on.

741
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:44,460
<29-1,SLAUGHTER>嗨  哥们
<29-1,SLAUGHTER>Hey, buddy.

742
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:48,990
<29-3,SLAUGHTER>-干得漂亮  -小菜一碟
<29-3,SLAUGHTER>- nice. - piece of cake, huh?

743
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:52,220
<29-4,SLAUGHTER>怎么啦  孩子
<29-4,SLAUGHTER>What's the matter, kid?

744
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:04,250
<29-5,SLAUGHTER>看来我们该叫上后援的
<29-5,SLAUGHTER>Guess we should have called for backup.

745
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,250
<29-6,CASTLE>马后炮
<29-6,CASTLE>Do you think?

746
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,550
<30-1,SLAUGHTER>傻货们  杀警察对于你们的犯罪记录
<30-1,SLAUGHTER>OK, chuckleheads, killing a police officer's

747
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:15,890
<30-1,SLAUGHTER>可不是什么好的补充材料
<30-1,SLAUGHTER>not exactly a good addition to your rap sheet.

748
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:17,640
<30-2,CASTLE>或是杀畅销作家
<30-2,CASTLE>O-or a best-selling author.

749
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:19,410
<30-3,DAVID LACEY>如果谁也找不到你们的尸体
<30-3,DAVID LACEY>It's kind of hard to charge us with murder

750
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:21,470
<30-3,DAVID LACEY>要控告我们谋杀貌似有点难
<30-3,DAVID LACEY>if nobody ever finds the bodies.

751
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,280
<30-4,THUG>要我把那小孩先弄出去吗
<30-4,THUG>Should I take the kid out of here?

752
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:24,460
<30-5,LACEY>不用  让他看着
<30-5,LACEY>Nah, let him watch.

753
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:26,240
<30-5,LACEY>这样也好让他明白如果不照我说的做
<30-5,LACEY>This way, he knows what's gonna happen to him

754
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,090
<30-5,LACEY>他会有什么样的下场
<30-5,LACEY>if he doesn't do exactly what I ask.

755
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:35,230
<30-6,LACEY>你他妈的在干什么
<30-6,LACEY>What the hell are you doing?

756
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:37,850
<30-7,LACEY>停下来
<30-7,LACEY>Hey, knock it off!

757
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:39,170
<30-8,SLAUGHTER>大侦探  我们就要死在这儿了
<30-8,SLAUGHTER>Sherlock, we're gonna die here.

758
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,790
<30-8,SLAUGHTER>我们好歹试着死得爷们一点行吗
<30-8,SLAUGHTER>Let's at least try to do it like men, huh?

759
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,940
<30-8,SLAUGHTER>男孩  男孩  疯狂的男孩
<30-8,SLAUGHTER>Boy, boy, crazy boy

761
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,510

<30-9,CASTLE>Got a rocket in your pocket

762
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:52,230
<30-9,CASTLE>保持冷静  男孩
<30-9,CASTLE>Keep cooly cool, boy

763
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:56,300

<30-10,SLAUGHTER>Don't get hot 'cause, man, you got some high times ahead ?

764
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:59,530
<30-11,SLAUGHTER_CASTLE>男孩  男孩  疯狂的男孩
<30-11,SLAUGHTER_CASTLE>Boy, boy, crazy boy

766
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:04,950
<30-11,SLAUGHTER_CASTLE>吹吹小风  放轻松  不是很容易吗
<30-11,SLAUGHTER_CASTLE>Breeze it, buzz it, easy does it ?

767
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:07,830
<30-12,LACEY>-谁来打死这两个家伙  -打开那果汁  男孩
<30-12,LACEY>- Will somebody please shoot these guys! - Turn up the juice, boy

768
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:08,710
<30-13,SLAUGHTER_CASTLE>打斗场面开始
<30-13,SLAUGHTER_CASTLE>Fight scene!

769
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:16,330
<30-14,CASTLE>抱歉
<30-14,CASTLE>Sorry.

770
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,070
<30-14,CASTLE>不许动
<30-14,CASTLE>Don't move!

771
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,210
<30-14,CASTLE>把手举起来
<30-14,CASTLE>Show me your hands!

772
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:30,440
<31-1,DETECTIVE ETHAN SLAUGHTER>就这些
<31-1,DETECTIVE ETHAN SLAUGHTER>Is that it?

773
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,710
<31-1,DETECTIVE ETHAN SLAUGHTER>你就带来这么点人吗
<31-1,DETECTIVE ETHAN SLAUGHTER>Is that all the guys you brought?

774
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,700
<31-2,RYAN>你觉得我们乐意这样吗
<31-2,RYAN>You think we enjoy this?

775
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:00,540
<32-1,LOUIS>谢谢你来找我
<32-1,LOUIS>Hey, uh, thanks for coming for me.

776
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,510
<32-1,LOUIS>维克多没看错人
<32-1,LOUIS>Victor wasn't wrong about you.

777
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:05,300
<32-2,SLAUGHTER>没错  但是我看错了他
<32-2,SLAUGHTER>Yeah. But I was wrong about Victor.

778
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:07,130
<32-2,SLAUGHTER>他是个糟糕的榜样
<32-2,SLAUGHTER>He was a crappy role model.

779
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,030
<32-3,LOUIS>你是个糟糕的歌手
<32-3,LOUIS>And you're a crappy singer.

780
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,420
<32-4,SLAUGHTER>你们搞定雷西一伙了吗
<32-4,SLAUGHTER>You nail Lacey and his crew?

781
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:14,180
<32-4,SLAUGHTER>是的
<32-4,SLAUGHTER>Yeah.

782
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,960
<32-5,RYAN>他们因为绑架和试图谋杀
<32-5,RYAN>They'll be doing some serious time

783
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,160
<32-5,RYAN>得蹲很长一段时间的牢房了
<32-5,RYAN>for kidnapping and attempted murder.

784
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,900
<32-6,SLAUGHTER>为什么他们没有被控告谋杀
<32-6,SLAUGHTER>Why aren't they getting charged with actual murder?

785
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,380
<32-7,CASTLE>因为他们谁都没杀维克多
<32-7,CASTLE>Because none of them killed Victor.

786
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:23,430
<32-8,ESPOSITO>维克多被害的时候
<32-8,ESPOSITO>They were at a restaurant in SoHo

787
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:25,000
<32-8,ESPOSITO>他们都在苏活区的一家餐厅
<32-8,ESPOSITO>at the time of victor's homicide.

788
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,890
<32-9,SLAUGHTER>就是说我们又回到原点
<32-9,SLAUGHTER>So we're right back to square one.

789
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:28,100
<32-10,CASTLE>倒不会
<32-10,CASTLE>Not necessarily.

790
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:31,040
<32-10,CASTLE>路易斯  你还记得任何关于维克多死时的事吗
<32-10,CASTLE>Louis, is there anything you can remember about Victor's death?

791
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,860
<32-11,LOUIS>没有了  我发誓
<32-11,LOUIS>Nothing. I swear.

792
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:34,760
<32-12,RYAN>但是你和维克多  你确实用你的设备
<32-12,RYAN>But you and Victor -- you did use your device

793
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,360
<32-12,RYAN>进入了布斯大厦然后偷走了那个芯片  对吧
<32-12,RYAN>to break into Booth Tower and steal that microchip, right?

794
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,610
<32-13,LOUIS>维克多带着这个主意来找我
<32-13,LOUIS>Victor came to me with the idea.

795
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:44,460
<32-13,LOUIS>他受够了拿那点薪水生活
<32-13,LOUIS>He was sick of living paycheck to paycheck,

796
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:46,060
<32-13,LOUIS>他承诺把芯片卖给布斯的竞争对手后
<32-13,LOUIS>promised to split the profit that we got

797
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:48,110
<32-13,LOUIS>我们把得来的钱对半分
<32-13,LOUIS>from selling the chip to Booth's competitor,

798
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,090
<32-13,LOUIS>那样我就可以照顾我妈了
<32-13,LOUIS>and I could take care of my mom for once.

799
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:52,880
<32-13,LOUIS>但是他没来取芯片
<32-13,LOUIS>But when he didn't show up for the chip,

800
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,290
<32-13,LOUIS>我不知道该怎么办
<32-13,LOUIS>I didn't know what to do.

801
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,830
<32-14,CASTLE>等一下  芯片在你那里
<32-14,CASTLE>Wait -- you have the chip?

802
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,570
<32-15,CASTLE>这是你们计划好的吗
<32-15,CASTLE>And was that part of the plan?

803
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:07,910
<32-16,LOUIS>不  我们从大厦离开的时候
<32-16,LOUIS>No, when we were leaving the tower,

804
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:09,610
<32-16,LOUIS>维克多开始表现得有点奇怪
<32-16,LOUIS>Victor started getting all weird.

805
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:10,940
<32-17,ESPOSITO>为什么  发生了什么事
<32-17,ESPOSITO>Why? What happened?

806
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:13,010
<32-18,LOUIS>我不知道  但是他更改了原计划
<32-18,LOUIS>I don't know, but he deviated from our plan.

807
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:14,540
<32-18,LOUIS>他告诉我拿好那个芯片
<32-18,LOUIS>He told me to hang on to the chip

808
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:15,950
<32-18,LOUIS>他还说他晚点儿跟我汇合
<32-18,LOUIS>and that he would catch up later.

809
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:18,810
<32-18,LOUIS>他说他得去办一些事儿
<32-18,LOUIS>Said he had to... take care of some business.

810
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,710
<32-19,SLAUGHTER>那可能是为了一个干更大的一笔
<32-19,SLAUGHTER>That's probably part of the bigger score.

811
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:23,510
<32-20,LOUIS>更大的一笔什么
<32-20,LOUIS>What bigger score?

812
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,800
<32-21,SLAUGHTER>真不想告诉你这些  孩子
<32-21,SLAUGHTER>Hate to tell you, kid.

813
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:28,160
<32-21,SLAUGHTER>闯入大楼从一开始就不是为了偷芯片
<32-21,SLAUGHTER>That break-in was never just about stealing that microchip.

814
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,870
<32-21,SLAUGHTER>那是向全城的抢劫团伙打广告
<32-21,SLAUGHTER>It was an advertisement to all the heist crews in town.

815
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:33,370
<32-22,CASTLE>为你的发明打广告
<32-22,CASTLE>For your invention.

816
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:36,030
<32-22,CASTLE>维克多在利用你
<32-22,CASTLE>Victor was using you.

817
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:43,770
<32-22,CASTLE>我要跟负责人谈话
<32-22,CASTLE>Hey, I need to speak to somebody in charge.

818
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:49,380
<33-1,RYAN>布斯先生  我是莱恩警探
<33-1,RYAN>Mr. Booth. I'm detective Ryan.

819
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,900
<33-1,RYAN>这位是埃斯珀西托警探
<33-1,RYAN>This is detective Esposito.

820
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:53,730
<33-2,BOOTH>那就是闯进我大楼的那个混蛋
<33-2,BOOTH>So, that's the punk who broke into my building,

821
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:55,680
<33-2,BOOTH>他让我变成了一个笑话
<33-2,BOOTH>Turned me into a late-night punch line, huh?

822
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,430
<33-3,ESPOSITO>我们找回了您的芯片
<33-3,ESPOSITO>We recovered your microchip.

823
00:33:57,490 --> 00:33:58,590
<33-4,BOOTH>谁在乎芯片
<33-4,BOOTH>Who cares?

824
00:33:58,820 --> 00:33:59,970
<33-4,BOOTH>我们能私下谈谈吗
<33-4,BOOTH>A word in private?

825
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:00,790
<33-5,RYAN>可以
<33-5,RYAN>Yes.

826
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,350
<34-1,BOOTH>先生们  你们知道
<34-1,BOOTH>Gentlemen, as you know,

827
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:15,600
<34-1,BOOTH>我是纽约警局的一位慷慨的支持者
<34-1,BOOTH>I am a generous supporter of the NYPD,

828
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:18,980
<34-1,BOOTH>无论是警察球队或者寡妇和孤儿基金我都支持
<34-1,BOOTH>Be it the policeman's ball or the widows and orphans fund.

829
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:21,230
<34-2,RYAN>布斯先生  您需要我们为您做什么吗
<34-2,RYAN>Mr. Booth, is there something you need from us?

830
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:22,350
<34-3,BOOTH>帮我个忙
<34-3,BOOTH>A favor.

831
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,410
<34-4,ESPOSITO>-我想  是一个需要很谨慎的忙  -是的
<34-4,ESPOSITO>- A discreet one, I take it. - Yes.

832
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:26,080
<34-5,BOOTH>竞争对手先把芯片推向市场
<34-5,BOOTH>The money I'd lose if a rival brought

833
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,540
<34-5,BOOTH>使我损失的那笔钱
<34-5,BOOTH>a version of that microchip to market before me

834
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:30,700
<34-5,BOOTH>比起那小子从大楼偷走的真正财富
<34-5,BOOTH>pales in comparison to the real fortune

835
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:32,700
<34-5,BOOTH>简直一文不值
<34-5,BOOTH>that punk kid stole from my building.

836
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:34,420
<34-6,ESPOSITO>什么财富
<34-6,ESPOSITO>What fortune is that?

837
00:34:34,930 --> 00:34:37,750
<34-7,BOOTH>今天早些时候  我的一个开曼群岛的账户
<34-7,BOOTH>Earlier today, $50 million was wired

838
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:39,930
<34-7,BOOTH>划走了五千万美元
<34-7,BOOTH>from a cayman islands account I have.

839
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,600
<34-8,RYAN>-一个私人账户  -你是说秘密账户
<34-8,RYAN>- a private account. - you mean a secret account.

840
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,730
<34-10,RYAN>是的  背着我太太  那账户需要继续保密
<34-10,RYAN>Yeah -- from my wife. It needs to stay that way.

841
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:47,760
<34-11,BOOTH>所以我需要你们无论如何
<34-11,BOOTH>So I need you to do whatever it takes

842
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,760
<34-11,BOOTH>找回我的钱并且避免更多的丑闻
<34-11,BOOTH>to recover my money quietly to avoid further scandal.

843
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,550
<34-11,BOOTH>明白吗
<34-11,BOOTH>Do you understand?

844
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:53,260
<34-12,ESPOSITO>你为什么觉得是那孩子偷了你的钱
<34-12,ESPOSITO>What makes you think this kid stole your money?

845
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,470
<34-13,BOOTH>还有谁有机会这么干
<34-13,BOOTH>Who else could have?

846
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:55,810
<34-13,BOOTH>账户号码  转账密码
<34-13,BOOTH>Account number, the transfer codes --

847
00:34:55,810 --> 00:34:58,360
<34-13,BOOTH>都被保存在一个电子保险箱里
<34-13,BOOTH>They were kept in an electronic safe in my office two floors up

848
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,600
<34-13,BOOTH>就在他偷走芯片的无菌室两层楼以上
<34-13,BOOTH>from the clean room where he stole the microchip.

849
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,880
<34-13,BOOTH>我是说  那孩子是个天才
<34-13,BOOTH>I mean, the kid's a genius.

850
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:04,260
<34-13,BOOTH>他有一个设备可以开我的锁  不是吗
<34-13,BOOTH>Got a device that can open any lock, right?

851
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:07,070
<35-1,LOUIS>我对什么开曼账户一无所知
<35-1,LOUIS>I don't know anything about a cayman account,

852
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:08,860
<35-1,LOUIS>而且我发誓我没偷什么五千万美金
<35-1,LOUIS>And I sure as hell didn't steal $50 million!

853
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:10,380
<35-2,ESPOSITO>路易斯  哥们  对我们说实话
<35-2,ESPOSITO>Louis, come on, man. Be straight with us.

854
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:12,910
<35-3,SLAUGHTER>是的孩子  如果你拿了那笔钱  首先  厉害
<35-3,SLAUGHTER>Yeah, kid, if you took that money, first of all, impressive,

855
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:14,940
<35-3,SLAUGHTER>更重要的是  你得坦白
<35-3,SLAUGHTER>but more importantly, you got to fess up.

856
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,170
<35-4,LOUIS>听着  不是我拿的
<35-4,LOUIS>Look, it wasn't me.

857
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:18,590
<35-4,LOUIS>伙计们  我想他说的是实话
<35-4,LOUIS>Guys, I think he's telling the truth.

858
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,750
<35-5,CASTLE>如果路易斯偷了钱
<35-5,CASTLE>If Louis stole the money,

859
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,740
<35-5,CASTLE>他一开始为什么会去向斯勒特求援
<35-5,CASTLE>why would he go to Slaughter for help in the first place?

860
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,590
<35-5,CASTLE>我们为什么会在一个仓库里找到他
<35-5,CASTLE>Why would we find him hiding in a warehouse?

861
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:25,990
<35-6,SLAUGHTER>大侦探说得对  这孩子是个天才
<35-6,SLAUGHTER>Look, Sherlock's got a point here. Kid's a genius.

862
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:28,450
<35-6,SLAUGHTER>有五千万美金  我们还没来得及眨眼
<35-6,SLAUGHTER>With $50 million, he'd drop off the face of the earth

863
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,830
<35-6,SLAUGHTER>他就逃出地球表面了
<35-6,SLAUGHTER>before we could even blink.

864
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:31,950
<35-7,RYAN>好吧  路易斯  是否有可能
<35-7,RYAN>Okay, Louis, is it possible

865
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:34,360
<35-7,RYAN>是维克多从保险箱里偷走了密码
<35-7,RYAN>that Victor stole the codes from that safe?

866
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:34,890
<35-8,LOUIS>不  不可能
<35-8,LOUIS>No. No way.

867
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:37,140
<35-8,LOUIS>我们在大楼里的时候他跟我一秒都没分开过
<35-8,LOUIS>He was with me every second we were inside that building.

868
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,590
<35-9,RYAN>那到底怎么回事
<35-9,RYAN>So, what are we saying here?

869
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:40,670
<35-9,RYAN>另有他人闯进了那座大楼
<35-9,RYAN>Someone else broke into that building, too?

870
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:42,600
<35-9,RYAN>等等
<35-9,RYAN>Wait.

871
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:45,620
<35-10,CASTLE>你说过当你们离开那座大楼的时候
<35-10,CASTLE>You said that when you and Victor left the building,

872
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:47,150
<35-10,CASTLE>他开始表现得奇怪
<35-10,CASTLE>he started acting strange,

873
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:50,940
<35-10,CASTLE>还改变了原计划  把芯片给你了
<35-10,CASTLE>broke from your original plan by giving you the microchip.

874
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,680
<35-11,LOUIS>是的
<35-11,LOUIS>Yeah.

875
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,490
<35-12,CASTLE>那么  也许他这么做是因为看到了什么
<35-12,CASTLE>Well, maybe he did that because he saw something.

876
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:54,310
<35-13,ESPOSITO>像是什么
<35-13,ESPOSITO>Like what?

877
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,950
<35-14,CASTLE>他认为自己看到了
<35-14,CASTLE>Something that made him think

878
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:57,820
<35-14,CASTLE>其他人尾随  利用他们的行径
<35-14,CASTLE>that someone else was piggybacking on the burglary

879
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,210
<35-14,CASTLE>干了自己的一票
<35-14,CASTLE>to pull a heist of their own.

880
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:01,060
<35-14,CASTLE>还有谁知道你们的计划
<35-14,CASTLE>Who else knew about your plan?

881
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:01,850
<35-15,LOUIS>没人
<35-15,LOUIS>No one.

882
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:03,650
<35-15,LOUIS>至少我没跟任何人说过
<35-15,LOUIS>At least not from me.

883
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,200
<35-16,SLAUGHTER>但也许维克多说过
<35-16,SLAUGHTER>But maybe from Victor.

884
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:07,390
<35-16,SLAUGHTER>等一下
<35-16,SLAUGHTER>Hey, wait a minute.

885
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,170
<35-17,LOUIS>当我们进到大楼地下室里的服务电梯时
<35-17,LOUIS>When we accessed the building's service elevators

886
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:11,290
<35-17,LOUIS>维克多把门用楔子顶开了
<35-17,LOUIS>in the basement, Victor wedged the door open.

887
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:12,890
<35-17,LOUIS>但我们走的时候  门是关着的
<35-17,LOUIS>But when we left, it was closed.

888
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:14,610
<35-17,LOUIS>我还以为是被风吹的
<35-17,LOUIS>I-I-I assumed it was a draft.

889
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:15,940
<35-18,SLAUGHTER>有可能是别人
<35-18,SLAUGHTER>It could have been a second thief.

890
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:18,310
<35-18,SLAUGHTER>该死  肯定是这事吓到了维克多
<35-18,SLAUGHTER>Hot damn. That's got to be what spooked Victor.

891
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:19,240
<35-19,ESPOSITO>也许当维克多说
<35-19,ESPOSITO>Maybe when Victor said

892
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,700
<35-19,ESPOSITO>他需要先处理一些事
<35-19,ESPOSITO>that he had to take care of something first,

893
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,730
<35-19,ESPOSITO>就是要去找这个贼对质
<35-19,ESPOSITO>it was to confront this piggyback thief.

894
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:25,000
<35-20,RYAN>也就是说后来闯入的人
<35-20,RYAN>Which means whoever our second burglar was

895
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,860
<35-20,RYAN>不仅仅知道他们要抢劫布斯的计划
<35-20,RYAN>not only knew about the plan to rob Booth

896
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:29,260
<35-20,RYAN>还知道布斯把秘密账户的密码
<35-20,RYAN>but also had knowledge of where Booth kept those codes

897
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:30,390
<35-20,RYAN>放在哪
<35-20,RYAN>for his secret account.

898
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:33,590
<35-21,CASTLE>我们找到那个人  就找到凶手了
<35-21,CASTLE>We find that person, we find our killer.

899
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:37,350
<36-1,CASTLE>我们漏掉了一些东西  先生们
<36-1,CASTLE>We are missing something, gentlemen.

900
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:39,490
<36-1,CASTLE>准确地说  我们漏掉了某个人
<36-1,CASTLE>More specifically, we're missing someone --

901
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:42,190
<36-1,CASTLE>某个既知道维克多和路易斯
<36-1,CASTLE>a person who knew Victor and Louis

902
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:42,980
<36-1,CASTLE>在计划盗窃
<36-1,CASTLE>were planning their heist

903
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:46,170
<36-1,CASTLE>同时又对布斯的财产了如指掌的人
<36-1,CASTLE>and had intimate knowledge of Booth's finances.

904
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:47,540
<36-1,CASTLE>我们的凶手
<36-1,CASTLE>We'll find our killer

905
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:49,900
<36-1,CASTLE>就在这个维恩图解的交集里
<36-1,CASTLE>in the intersection of that Venn Diagram.

906
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,220
<36-2,ESPOSITO>唯一的问题就是  那会是谁呢
<36-2,ESPOSITO>Only question is, who could that be?

907
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,190
<36-3,CASTLE>拜托  埃斯波西托
<36-3,CASTLE>Oh, come on, Espo.

908
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:58,200
<36-3,CASTLE>你不会真的准备起诉路易斯吧
<36-3,CASTLE>You're not really gonna charge Louis, are you?

909
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:02,800
<36-4,ESPOSITO>他犯了法  卡塞尔  这不是在玩大富翁
<36-4,ESPOSITO>He broke the law, Castle. It's not "Monopoly".

910
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,600
<36-4,ESPOSITO>没有"免收牢狱之灾"的游戏卡
<36-4,ESPOSITO>There's no "get out of jail free" card.

911
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,850
<36-5,SLAUGHTER>重大盗窃
<36-5,SLAUGHTER>Grand theft.

912
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:08,200
<36-5,SLAUGHTER>就算他未成年  也还是要蹲监狱的
<36-5,SLAUGHTER>Even though he's a minor, he's looking at real time.

913
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,160
<36-6,CASTLE>这孩子从头到尾就没别无选择
<36-6,CASTLE>Kid never stood a chance.

914
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:12,220
<36-6,CASTLE>他这辈子都被那些本应成为
<36-6,CASTLE>All his life, he'd been taken advantage of

915
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:14,520
<36-6,CASTLE>他模范榜样的成人所利用
<36-6,CASTLE>by adults who should be acting like his role models.

916
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:18,150
<36-8,ESPOSITO>怎么了  你有所发现吗
<36-8,ESPOSITO>What's up, man? You got something?

917
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,090
<36-9,RYAN>当我问布斯先生
<36-9,RYAN>While questioning Mr. Booth

918
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:21,410
<36-9,RYAN>关于他在开曼群岛的账户时
<36-9,RYAN>about his Cayman Island accounts,

919
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:23,890
<36-9,RYAN>他说那些账户是五年前才开的
<36-9,RYAN>he told me that they were set up a mere five years ago.

920
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:25,730
<36-10,SLAUGHTER>是吗  那又怎样
<36-10,SLAUGHTER>Yeah? So?

921
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:28,330
<36-11,RYAN>猜猜谁当时在帮他开户的那家
<36-11,RYAN>So guess who worked at the accounting firm

922
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:29,690
<36-11,RYAN>会计师事务所工作
<36-11,RYAN>that originally set them up.

923
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:34,490
<37-1,MARK WEST>我很开心你们在路易斯遭遇不幸之前
<37-1,MARK WEST>I'm just glad you guys were able to find Louis

924
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:36,720
<37-1,MARK WEST>找到了他
<37-1,MARK WEST>before something horrible happened to him.

925
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,530
<37-2,RYAN>是啊  我们很幸运
<37-2,RYAN>Yes, uh, we got lucky.

926
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:39,790
<37-2,RYAN>请坐
<37-2,RYAN>Please -- uh, have a seat.

927
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:42,850
<37-3,WEST>可怜的孩子
<37-3,WEST>Poor kid.

928
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,000
<37-3,WEST>他受了太多苦
<37-3,WEST>He's -- he's been through so much.

929
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,190
<37-3,WEST>路易斯案子上庭的时候
<37-3,WEST>You know, I'd like to testify

930
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:48,010
<37-3,WEST>我愿意当他的品行证人
<37-3,WEST>as a character witness on Louis' behalf

931
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:49,160
<37-3,WEST>为他出庭作证
<37-3,WEST>when his case goes to trial.

932
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,010
<37-4,ESPOSITO>你真是个好人  韦斯特先生
<37-4,ESPOSITO>That's very kind of you, Mr. West.

933
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,480
<37-4,ESPOSITO>但你那时候不会忙着自己的庭审吗
<37-4,ESPOSITO>But won't you be too busy with your own trial?

934
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,930
<37-5,WEST>我的庭审  你在说什么
<37-5,WEST>My trial? What are you talking about?

935
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,080
<37-6,RYAN>我们已经知道了
<37-6,RYAN>We know.

936
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:59,150
<37-7,WEST>知道什么
<37-7,WEST>You know what?

937
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:02,280
<37-8,RYAN>首先  你不是一直在帮助高危青少年
<37-8,RYAN>Well, for starters, you didn't always work with at-risk youth.

938
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,660
<37-9,WEST>是  我以前有别的工作  那又如何
<37-9,WEST>No, I mean, I've had other jobs. So?

939
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:06,900
<37-10,ESPOSITO>你曾做过布斯先生的会计
<37-10,ESPOSITO>So you were Mr. Booth's accountant,

940
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:09,450
<37-10,ESPOSITO>替他处理过一些最敏感的事务
<37-10,ESPOSITO>where you worked on his most sensitive matters.

941
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:12,090
<37-11,RYAN>比如在海外银行建立避税账户
<37-11,RYAN>Like setting up tax shelters in offshore banks.

942
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:14,450
<37-12,WEST>是的  那那份工作实在太没有成就感了
<37-12,WEST>Well, yeah, but the work was unfulfilling,

943
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:16,550
<37-12,WEST>于是我就离开了  因为我想回馈社会
<37-12,WEST>so I left because I wanted to give back to the community.

944
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:18,820
<37-13,RYAN>不  你是想回馈给布斯先生的妻子
<37-13,RYAN>No, you wanted to give back to Mr. Booth's wife,

945
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:21,190
<37-13,RYAN>但她并不接受你的性挑逗
<37-13,RYAN>but she didn't appreciate your sexual advances,

946
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:23,280
<37-13,RYAN>于是布斯先生就把你给炒了
<37-13,RYAN>so Mr. Booth fired your ass.

947
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,110
<37-14,ESPOSITO>你丢了工作  丢了养老金
<37-14,ESPOSITO>Yeah, you lost your job, you lost your pension,

948
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:27,530
<37-14,ESPOSITO>和那些优先认股权
<37-14,ESPOSITO>all those stock options.

949
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:28,870
<37-15,WEST>好吧  听着
<37-15,WEST>All right. Listen.

950
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,040
<37-15,WEST>我知道这段过去不光彩  但是
<37-15,WEST>I know how this looks, but --

951
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,590
<37-16,ESPOSITO>你的声誉毁于一旦
<37-16,ESPOSITO>Your reputation was ruined.

952
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:32,830
<37-16,ESPOSITO>你能找到的唯一工作
<37-16,ESPOSITO>The only job you could get

953
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:34,580
<37-16,ESPOSITO>就是帮助少年犯
<37-16,ESPOSITO>was working with juvenile delinquents.

954
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:36,670
<37-17,RYAN>这可不是你习惯的养尊处优的生活
<37-17,RYAN>Not exactly the cushy life you were used to.

955
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:39,010
<37-18,ESPOSITO>所以当你听说路易斯的发明时
<37-18,ESPOSITO>So you heard about Louis' invention,

956
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:41,190
<37-18,ESPOSITO>你看到的不仅仅是回归上流生活的途径
<37-18,ESPOSITO>and you saw not only a way to get back on top...

957
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:43,660
<37-19,RYAN>同时也是报复那个毁了你的生活的
<37-19,RYAN>But also get revenge on your former boss,

958
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:45,000
<37-19,RYAN>前任老板的方法
<37-19,RYAN>who ruined your life.

959
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:46,700
<37-19,RYAN>所以你才说服维克多
<37-19,RYAN>That's why you convinced Victor

960
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:47,960
<37-19,RYAN>策划了那些盗窃  对吧
<37-19,RYAN>to pull that heist, didn't you?

961
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,110
<37-20,ESPOSITO>这样一来你就可以跟在他后面进去
<37-20,ESPOSITO>So that you could go in right behind him

962
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:52,510
<37-20,ESPOSITO>盗取开曼群岛账户的密码
<37-20,ESPOSITO>and steal those Cayman Island bank codes.

963
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:56,760
<37-21,WEST>这是你们想象出来的故事
<37-21,WEST>Well, that is an imaginative story.

964
00:38:57,170 --> 00:38:59,550
<37-21,WEST>有意想不到的转折  复仇
<37-21,WEST>It had surprise twists, revenge.

965
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:03,570
<37-21,WEST>唯一缺少的就是证据
<37-21,WEST>all that's missing is the proof.

966
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:05,470
<37-22,ESPOSITO>像是从你家电脑上
<37-22,ESPOSITO>Like records of the bank transfers

967
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:06,690
<37-22,ESPOSITO>找出的银行转账记录吗
<37-22,ESPOSITO>on your home computer?

968
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:08,680
<37-22,ESPOSITO>我们取得了你家的搜查令  马克
<37-22,ESPOSITO>We got a warrant for your place, Mark.

969
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:10,260
<37-23,RYAN>我们还有你在维克多被杀当晚
<37-23,RYAN>We also have a credit-card receipt

970
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:12,910
<37-23,RYAN>你打车去他家的
<37-23,RYAN>for a cab ride that you took to Victor's apartment

971
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:14,400
<37-23,RYAN>信用卡收据
<37-23,RYAN>on the night he was murdered.

972
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:17,060
<37-24,RYAN>一切都结束了  韦斯特先生
<37-24,RYAN>It's over, Mr. West.

973
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,740
<37-24,RYAN>维克多本不该知道
<37-24,RYAN>Look, Victor wasn't supposed to know

974
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:19,680
<37-25,WEST>我的计划
<37-25,WEST>what I was doing, all right?

975
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,810
<37-25,WEST>但他不知怎么发现了
<37-25,WEST>But somehow he found out,

976
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:22,810
<37-25,WEST>他在他家质问我
<37-25,WEST>and he confronted me at his apartment.

977
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:24,430
<37-25,WEST>我被吓到了
<37-25,WEST>Now, I panicked, okay?

978
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:25,090
<37-25,WEST>我
<37-25,WEST>I...

979
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:27,460
<37-25,WEST>我没想杀他
<37-25,WEST>I didn't mean to kill him.

980
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:29,900
<37-25,WEST>我  你们得相信我  那不是
<37-25,WEST>I -- you have to believe me. That was not --

981
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,040
<38-1,SLAUGHTER>拜托  事情没那么糟  孩子
<38-1,SLAUGHTER>Ah, come on. It ain't that bad, kid.

982
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:45,070
<38-1,SLAUGHTER>我们抓到那个混蛋了不是吗
<38-1,SLAUGHTER>We caught the bastard, didn't we?

983
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,450
<38-2,LOUIS>但我还是要进监狱
<38-2,LOUIS>But I'm still going to prison.

984
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:50,660
<38-2,LOUIS>我要蹲多少年
<38-2,LOUIS>How much time am I looking at?

985
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,130
<38-3,SLAUGHTER>也许用不着
<38-3,SLAUGHTER>Maybe none.

986
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,470
<38-4,LOUIS>什么  怎么会
<38-4,LOUIS>What? How?

987
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:56,110
<38-5,SLAUGHTER>你是个好孩子  路易斯
<38-5,SLAUGHTER>You're a good kid, Louis.

988
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:58,580
<38-5,SLAUGHTER>只因为你做了几个愚蠢的决定
<38-5,SLAUGHTER>Too good to be rotting in a cell

989
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:00,200
<38-5,SLAUGHTER>就把牢底坐穿实在是太可惜了
<38-5,SLAUGHTER>for a few bonehead decisions.

990
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:02,580
<38-5,SLAUGHTER>所以从现在开始  我要亲自确保
<38-5,SLAUGHTER>So from now on, I'm gonna personally see to it

991
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:04,330
<38-5,SLAUGHTER>有人会照看你
<38-5,SLAUGHTER>that you got someone looking out for you --

992
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:06,610
<38-5,SLAUGHTER>而且你能有个很酷的榜样
<38-5,SLAUGHTER>that you got a cool role model.

993
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:08,860
<38-6,LOUIS>你是说卡塞尔先生吗
<38-6,LOUIS>You mean Mr. Castle?

994
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:10,010
<38-6,LOUIS>不
<38-6,LOUIS>No.

995
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:11,640
<38-7,SLAUGHTER>是我
<38-7,SLAUGHTER>Me.

996
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,520
<38-8,LOUIS>真的吗
<38-8,LOUIS>Really?

997
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:14,570
<38-9,SLAUGHTER>那当然
<38-9,SLAUGHTER>You bet.

998
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:16,540
<38-9,SLAUGHTER>我要做的第一件事就是我要用我的关系
<38-9,SLAUGHTER>First thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna use my pull

999
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:19,300
<38-9,SLAUGHTER>让市长找检察官把你的刑罚
<38-9,SLAUGHTER>to get the mayor to ask the D.A. to reduce your sentence

1000
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,490
<38-9,SLAUGHTER>减为缓刑
<38-9,SLAUGHTER>down to probation.

1001
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,310
<38-10,LOUIS>你跟市长关系这么铁
<38-10,LOUIS>You've got that kind of clout with the mayor?

1002
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:24,040
<38-11,SLAUGHTER>才没有呢  但卡塞尔可以
<38-11,SLAUGHTER>Hell no. Castle does.

1003
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:26,060
<38-11,SLAUGHTER>我会确保他打电话给市长的
<38-11,SLAUGHTER>And I'm gonna see to it that he makes that call...

1004
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,300
<38-11,SLAUGHTER>不然的话
<38-11,SLAUGHTER>Or else.

1005
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:29,270
<38-12,LOUIS>如果卡塞尔先生不照你说的做
<38-12,LOUIS>S-so you're gonna beat up Mr. Castle

1006
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:30,690
<38-12,LOUIS>你就揍他
<38-12,LOUIS>if he doesn't do what you ask?

1007
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,560
<38-13,LOUIS>还真是个好榜样啊
<38-13,LOUIS>Some role model.

1008
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:39,440
<38-14,SLAUGHTER>你说得对
<38-14,SLAUGHTER>You got a point.

1009
00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:41,680
<38-14,SLAUGHTER>看来咱俩要
<38-14,SLAUGHTER>Looks like the two of us are gonna have to do

1010
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,260
<38-14,SLAUGHTER>互为对方的榜样了
<38-14,SLAUGHTER>some role modeling for each other.

1011
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:44,920
<38-14,SLAUGHTER>怎么样
<38-14,SLAUGHTER>Sound good?

1012
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:58,740
<39-1,SLAUGHTER>你又摆出那副痴情脸了
<39-1,SLAUGHTER>Uh-oh. You got that dumb look on your face again.

1013
00:40:58,920 --> 00:40:59,750
<39-1,SLAUGHTER>我
<39-1,SLAUGHTER>I...

1014
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:02,630
<39-2,CASTLE>我不知道  我只是搞不懂贝克特
<39-2,CASTLE>I don't know. I'm just confused about Beckett.

1015
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:03,980
<39-3,SLAUGHTER>我也搞不懂
<39-3,SLAUGHTER>That makes two of us.

1016
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:05,540
<39-3,SLAUGHTER>那么漂亮的一个女人
<39-3,SLAUGHTER>I mean, how does a hot lady like that

1017
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:06,920
<39-3,SLAUGHTER>怎么就爱上你了呢
<39-3,SLAUGHTER>fall in love with a guy like you --

1018
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:07,800
<39-3,SLAUGHTER>尤其是当世界上
<39-3,SLAUGHTER>especially when there's a real man,

1019
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,060
<39-3,SLAUGHTER>有我这种真男人的时候
<39-3,SLAUGHTER>like me, running around?

1020
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:09,750
<39-3,SLAUGHTER>斯勒特  你给我听着
<39-3,SLAUGHTER>Okay, Slaughter, you know what?

1021
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:11,910
<39-4,CASTLE>你说别的都没事  但不许说贝克特
<39-4,CASTLE>I'll take a lot of crap from you, but not about Beckett.

1022
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:12,730
<39-4,CASTLE>这对我来说不是玩笑
<39-4,CASTLE>It's not a joke to me.

1023
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:15,050
<39-5,SLAUGHTER>我只是想引起你的注意  大侦探
<39-5,SLAUGHTER>Just trying to get your attention, Sherlock.

1024
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:16,980
<39-5,SLAUGHTER>我知道的不多
<39-5,SLAUGHTER>Look, I don't know much,

1025
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:19,610
<39-5,SLAUGHTER>但我确认的是  那女人很爱你
<39-5,SLAUGHTER>but what I do know is that lady has it bad for you,

1026
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:21,380
<39-5,SLAUGHTER>而你也一样
<39-5,SLAUGHTER>and you feel the same.

1027
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:22,880
<39-6,CASTLE>你想说的是
<39-6,CASTLE>Your point?

1028
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,250
<39-7,SLAUGHTER>不管贝克特在干吗
<39-7,SLAUGHTER>Whatever's going on with Beckett,

1029
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:25,820
<39-7,SLAUGHTER>她都不该独自面对
<39-7,SLAUGHTER>she shouldn't have to go through it alone.

1030
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,950
<39-8,CASTLE>我试过了  但她不告诉我
<39-8,CASTLE>Yes, well, I've tried. She won't let me in.

1031
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:30,380
<39-9,SLAUGHTER>那就不要征得她的允许
<39-9,SLAUGHTER>Then quit asking permission.

1032
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,140
<39-9,SLAUGHTER>我就是因为自己不够男人
<39-9,SLAUGHTER>I lost my wife

1033
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,590
<39-9,SLAUGHTER>没有把我妻子的需要放在自己的前面
<39-9,SLAUGHTER>'cause I wasn't man enough

1034
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:37,120
<39-9,SLAUGHTER>才失去了她
<39-9,SLAUGHTER>to put her needs ahead of mine.

1035
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,680
<39-9,SLAUGHTER>别犯一样的错
<39-9,SLAUGHTER>Don't make the same mistake.

1036
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:43,060
<39-9,SLAUGHTER>你知道吗  斯勒特
<39-9,SLAUGHTER>You know what, Slaughter?

1037
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:46,350
<39-10,CASTLE>别看你平时总是夸大其词  虚张声势
<39-10,CASTLE>For all your bluster and bravado,

1038
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:49,900
<39-10,CASTLE>你实际上也是个聪明  并且敏感
<39-10,CASTLE>you're actually a wise and, dare I say, sensitive --

1039
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:51,980
<39-11,SLAUGHTER>你给我打住
<39-11,SLAUGHTER>Whoa! Hey! Stop right there.

1040
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:55,020
<39-11,SLAUGHTER>只有你能把两个男人讨论一个女人这种事的气氛
<39-11,SLAUGHTER>Only you could take two guys talking about a chick

1041
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:56,090
<39-11,SLAUGHTER>给搞得这么诡异
<39-11,SLAUGHTER>and make it weird.

1042
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:58,090
<39-12,CASTLE>抱歉
<39-12,CASTLE>Sorry.
