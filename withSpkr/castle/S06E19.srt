3
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,850
<1-1,RICHARD CASTLE>我在飓风上结婚怎么样
<1-1,RICHARD CASTLE>What if we got married on the cyclone?

4
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,390
<1-2,KATE BECKETT>科尼岛的过山车吗
<1-2,KATE BECKETT>The roller coaster at Coney Island?

5
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:30,460
<1-3,CASTLE>想想啊  那得多好玩
<1-3,CASTLE>Come on. How much fun would that be?

6
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:32,250
<1-3,CASTLE>而且你说这多合适啊
<1-3,CASTLE>And talk about an appropriate,

7
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,010
<1-3,CASTLE>虽然这暗喻的意思有点明显
<1-3,CASTLE>if not slightly on-the-nose metaphor...

8
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,010
<1-3,CASTLE>新娘新郎肩并肩
<1-3,CASTLE>a bride and groom together, side-by-side,

9
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:38,570
<1-3,CASTLE>经历人生中的起起伏伏
<1-3,CASTLE>as they go through the ups and downs,

10
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:40,880
<1-3,CASTLE>辗转波折  和周而复始
<1-3,CASTLE>the twists and turns, and the loop-de-loops of life.

11
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:41,970
<1-4,BECKETT>卡塞尔我爱你
<1-4,BECKETT>Castle, I love you,

12
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:43,460
<1-4,BECKETT>但我不会在车上  太空
<1-4,BECKETT>but I will not marry you on a ride

13
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,770
<1-4,BECKETT>或过山车上跟你结婚
<1-4,BECKETT>or up in space or on a slide.

14
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,120
<1-5,CASTLE>苏斯博士肯定在个很有趣的地方结的婚
<1-5,CASTLE>Bet Dr. Seuss got married somewhere fun.

15
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,180
<1-6,BECKETT>是啊  在他妻子的客厅里
<1-6,BECKETT>Yes, his wife's living room.

16
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,560
<1-7,BECKETT>而且那种过山车上
<1-7,BECKETT>How many people do you think can fit

17
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,700
<1-7,BECKETT>能塞下多少人啊
<1-7,BECKETT>in one of those roller-coaster cars, anyway?

18
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,220
<1-7,BECKETT>二三十吗
<1-7,BECKETT>20? 30?

19
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,680
<1-8,CASTLE>说得对
<1-8,CASTLE>You know, that's a good point.

22
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:02,640
<1-8,CASTLE>我们该决定好我们该请谁
<1-8,CASTLE>We should determine exactly whom we are going to invite.

24
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,060
<1-9,BECKETT>是啊  好主意
<1-9,BECKETT>Yeah, good idea.

25
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:07,010
<1-10,CASTLE>这样我们就能决定该建造一个
<1-10,CASTLE>That way we can determine exactly how big

27
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:08,490
<1-10,CASTLE>多大的过山车了
<1-10,CASTLE>a roller-coaster car we need to build.

28
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:10,740
<1-11,BECKETT>或者我们需要一个多大的实际场地
<1-11,BECKETT>Or how big of an actual venue we need.

30
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,310
<1-11,BECKETT>不管怎样  我去拿纸
<1-11,BECKETT>Either way, I'll go and get the paper.

31
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:13,240
<1-12,CASTLE>我去拿笔
<1-12,CASTLE>I'll get a pen.

32
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,020
<1-13,BECKETT>我还是接电话吧
<1-13,BECKETT>And I will get the phone.

34
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:25,060
<2-1,CASTLE>要知道  少请点人是很有道理的
<2-1,CASTLE>You know, there's a good argument for keeping the list really small.

35
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,070
<2-1,CASTLE>比如只请近亲
<2-1,CASTLE>Just immediate family.

36
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,830
<2-2,BECKETT>你的道理跟某种
<2-2,BECKETT>This argument doesn't have something to do with

37
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:30,920
<2-2,BECKETT>游乐园器械无关吧
<2-2,BECKETT>a certain amusement park ride, does it?

38
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:31,880
<2-3,CASTLE>我是认真的
<2-3,CASTLE>I'm being serious.

39
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,290
<2-3,CASTLE>结婚是件私密的事
<2-3,CASTLE>Getting married is an intimate act,

40
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:35,470
<2-3,CASTLE>我们的仪式应该也很有私密感
<2-3,CASTLE>and our ceremony should reflect that intimacy.

41
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:37,420
<2-3,CASTLE>而且这样  我们都能坐进过山车里了
<2-3,CASTLE>And that way, we could all fit into one car.

42
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:39,740
<2-3,CASTLE>莱恩  你对过山车什么意见
<2-3,CASTLE>Ryan, how do you feel about roller coasters?

43
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,350
<2-4,KEVIN RYAN>让我想吐  怎么了
<2-4,KEVIN RYAN>Ooh, make me nauseous. Why?

44
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,140
<2-5,BECKETT>没什么  死者是谁
<2-5,BECKETT>No reason. Who's our victim?

45
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,350
<2-6,BECKETT>彼得·科尔德罗  26岁
<2-6,BECKETT>Peter Cordero, 26.

46
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,020
<2-7,RYAN>据楼管说  他是独居
<2-7,RYAN>According to the super, he lives alone.

47
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,340
<2-7,RYAN>是哈丁集团的期货交易员
<2-7,RYAN>He's a future's trader at JP Harding,

48
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,820
<2-7,RYAN>是华尔街的投资公司
<2-7,RYAN>the Wall Street investment firm.

49
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:51,780
<2-8,BECKETT>他怎么死的
<2-8,BECKETT>And how was he killed?

50
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,480
<2-9,RYAN>胸口中一枪致死
<2-9,RYAN>Uh, single GSW to the chest.

51
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,210
<2-10,CASTLE>看来他的未来[期货]被卖掉了
<2-10,CASTLE>Looks like his own future got traded.

52
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:56,890
<2-11,BECKETT>而且还拼死挣扎了一番
<2-11,BECKETT>Yeah, not without a fight first.

53
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,330
<2-11,BECKETT>谁发现了尸体
<2-11,BECKETT>Who found the body?

54
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:00,740
<2-12,RYAN>这个问题很有趣
<2-12,RYAN>Well, that's an interesting question.

55
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:04,930
<2-12,RYAN>晚上10点3分  一个女人拨打911
<2-12,RYAN>At 10:03 p.m., a woman made a 911 call

56
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:06,960
<2-12,RYAN>电话是从街区前边一部付费电话打出
<2-12,RYAN>from a pay phone down the block,

57
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,800
<2-12,RYAN>但她没说名字
<2-12,RYAN>but she refused to leave her name.

58
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:10,370
<2-13,CASTLE>街区前边的一部付费电话
<2-13,CASTLE>A pay phone down the block?

59
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:12,300
<2-13,CASTLE>那她怎么知道他死了呢  除非...
<2-13,CASTLE>But how would she know he was dead unless...

60
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,040
<2-14,BECKETT>除非她进过公寓
<2-14,BECKETT>Unless she was in the apartment.

61
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:16,210
<2-15,LANIE PARISH>从尸斑来看  死亡时间
<2-15,LANIE PARISH>Well, lividity places the time of death

62
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:17,630
<2-15,LANIE PARISH>在8点到10点之间
<2-15,LANIE PARISH>8:00 and 10:00,

63
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:20,950
<2-15,LANIE PARISH>如果911电话是10点3分拨出
<2-15,LANIE PARISH>So if the 911 call came in at 10:03...

64
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,300
<2-16,BECKETT>她可能就是凶手
<2-16,BECKETT>She could be our killer.

65
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,140
<2-17,RYAN>埃斯波西托在检查监控录像
<2-17,RYAN>Esposito's checking security-cam footage.

66
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,640
<2-17,RYAN>希望能拍到她
<2-17,RYAN>Hopefully, we caught her on tape.

67
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,970
<2-18,CASTLE>只有我觉得奇怪吗
<2-18,CASTLE>Now, is it just me, or is it odd

68
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,320
<2-18,CASTLE>死者穿着西装外套  打领带  裤子
<2-18,CASTLE>that our victim is wearing a suit jacket, tie, pants,

69
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,640
<2-18,CASTLE>鞋子  却唯有衬衫解开了
<2-18,CASTLE>shoes, but his shirt is unbuttoned?

70
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,070
<2-19,LANIE>的确挺怪  还有这个
<2-19,LANIE>It's odd, all right. And look at this...

71
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:39,660
<2-19,LANIE>他被射杀时  他的衬衫是穿好扣好的
<2-19,LANIE>His shirt was on and buttoned when he was shot.

72
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:42,440
<2-20,BECKETT>那么凶手是在他死后解开衬衫的
<2-20,BECKETT>So our killer unbuttoned his shirt after he was dead.

73
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:43,510
<2-21,LANIE>是的
<2-21,LANIE>Yep.

74
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,560
<2-22,CASTLE>凶手在找什么
<2-22,CASTLE>The killer was looking for something.

75
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:48,960
<2-22,CASTLE>价值连城的项链  或者像《华尔街之狼》那样
<2-22,CASTLE>A pricy necklace or... oh, a bunch of cash

76
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,030
<2-22,CASTLE>找贴在他胸前的一堆现金
<2-22,CASTLE>taped to his chest like "Wolf of Wall Street."

77
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,260
<2-23,LANIE>还有别的
<2-23,LANIE>There's something else.

78
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,640
<2-23,LANIE>我完全找不到自卫伤
<2-23,LANIE>I didn't find any defensive wounds,

79
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:56,220
<2-23,LANIE>如果他们在那边发生了打斗
<2-23,LANIE>So if there was a fight out there,

80
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:57,940
<2-23,LANIE>估计他是没参与
<2-23,LANIE>I don't think this guy was in it.

81
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,710
<2-24,JAVIER ESPOSITO>贝克特
<2-24,JAVIER ESPOSITO>Yo, Beckett.

82
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,550
<2-24,JAVIER ESPOSITO>大堂没有监控摄像头
<2-24,JAVIER ESPOSITO>There are no security cameras in the lobby,

83
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:04,310
<2-24,JAVIER ESPOSITO>但街上一家酒肆有摄像头
<2-24,JAVIER ESPOSITO>but I found one in a liquor store down the street.

84
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:08,800
<2-24,JAVIER ESPOSITO>拍到了911电话打进来时付费电话那里的照片
<2-24,JAVIER ESPOSITO>It got a shot of that pay phone right when the 911 call came in.

85
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:10,820
<2-25,BECKETT>在邻里排查
<2-25,BECKETT>Okay. Canvas the neighbors.

86
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,460
<2-25,BECKETT>看是否有人在楼里看到过她
<2-25,BECKETT>See if anyone saw her in the building.

87
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,830
<2-25,BECKETT>你们找到近亲了吗
<2-25,BECKETT>Did you talk to next of kin yet?

88
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,390
<2-26,RYAN>他没有很近的亲属
<2-26,RYAN>Well, the guy didn't have any immediate family,

89
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:18,120
<2-26,RYAN>但他在皇后区有个堂亲
<2-26,RYAN>But he did list a cousin in Queens,

90
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,190
<2-26,RYAN>玛利亚·科尔德罗  是他的紧急联系人
<2-26,RYAN>a Maria Cordero, as his in-case-of-emergency.

91
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:21,960
<2-27,BECKETT>好的  去带她来局里
<2-27,BECKETT>All right, bring her in.

92
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,970
<2-27,BECKETT>看她是否认得照片里的女人
<2-27,BECKETT>Let's see if she recognizes the woman in the photo.

93
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,740
<2-27,BECKETT>我和卡塞尔去他工作的地方
<2-27,BECKETT>Castle and I will go to his place of work

94
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:26,650
<2-27,BECKETT>看看他们知道什么
<2-27,BECKETT>and see what they know there.

95
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:27,560
<2-27,BECKETT>好的
<2-27,BECKETT>All right.

96
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:37,400
<3-1,MARIA CORDERO>抱歉  我不认识她
<3-1,MARIA CORDERO>No. No. I'm sorry. I don't know her.

97
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:40,490
<3-2,ESPOSITO>玛利亚  你堂哥有没有提过他有女朋友
<3-2,ESPOSITO>Maria, did your cousin say anything about having a girlfriend?

98
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:43,740
<3-3,MARIA>没有  他说他没时间  工作是他的全部
<3-3,MARIA>No. He said he didn't have time. Work was his life.

99
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,230
<3-4,RYAN>你们很亲密吗
<3-4,RYAN>Were the two of you close?

100
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,960
<3-5,MARIA>彼得就像我哥哥一样
<3-5,MARIA>Peter was like my brother.

101
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:52,130
<3-5,MARIA>他10岁时  他父母死于委内瑞拉的一场大地震
<3-5,MARIA>When he was 10, his parents died in the big earthquake in Venezuela.

102
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:55,220
<3-5,MARIA>我父母领养了他  把他带来美国
<3-5,MARIA>My parents adopted him and brought him to the states.

103
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,700
<3-6,ESPOSITO>彼得有提过他有什么仇家吗
<3-6,ESPOSITO>Did Peter say anything about having any enemies?

104
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:01,500
<3-7,MARIA>没有  他人很好
<3-7,MARIA>No. Peter was a sweet guy.

105
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,710
<3-7,MARIA>他从未忘记自己的出身
<3-7,MARIA>He never forgot where he came from...

106
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:07,200
<3-7,MARIA>不像他工作上那些生于富贵人家的人
<3-7,MARIA>Not like those privileged, silver-spoon types he worked with.

107
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:08,670
<3-7,MARIA>他是个拿奖学金的孩子
<3-7,MARIA>He was a scholarship kid,

108
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,840
<3-7,MARIA>他得到的一切都是靠努力工作
<3-7,MARIA>so everything he got was through hard work.

109
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,480
<3-8,RYAN>你最后一次跟他说话是什么时候
<3-8,RYAN>When did you talk to him last?

110
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:14,920
<3-9,MARIA>几天前
<3-9,MARIA>A few days ago.

111
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,180
<3-10,ESPOSITO>他精神如何
<3-10,ESPOSITO>And how did he seem?

112
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,490
<3-11,MARIA>压力很大的样子
<3-11,MARIA>Stressed, actually.

113
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:22,280
<3-12,ESPOSITO>他说是什么事了吗
<3-12,ESPOSITO>Did he say what about?

114
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,380
<3-13,MARIA>没有  我不知道
<3-13,MARIA>No. I-I don't know.

115
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:27,150
<3-13,MARIA>我问他时  他只说是工作上的事
<3-13,MARIA>When I asked him, he said something happened at work,

116
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:29,190
<3-13,MARIA>不过他应付得来
<3-13,MARIA>but it wasn't anything he couldn't handle.

117
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,580
<4-1,BECKETT>哈丁集团投资银行
<4-1,BECKETT>JP Harding investment bank.

118
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,880
<4-1,BECKETT>这里要么是资本主义的动力
<4-1,BECKETT>This place is either the engine of capitalism

119
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,600
<4-1,BECKETT>要么是贪婪和腐败的代表
<4-1,BECKETT>or the poster child of greed and corruption,

120
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,490
<4-1,BECKETT>这要看你读哪份报纸了
<4-1,BECKETT>depending on which paper you read.

121
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,820
<4-2,CASTLE>或许是市场的无形之手杀了彼得
<4-2,CASTLE>Maybe the invisible hand of the market killed Peter.

122
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,940
<4-2,CASTLE>这就能解释他为什么没有自卫伤了
<4-2,CASTLE>It would explain the lack of defensive wounds.

123

<5-5,BURMAN>你们这些证监会找茬的去跟我律师谈
<5-5,BURMAN>I told you S.E.C. pricks to talk to my lawyer.

<5-7,BURMAN>凶案组

<6-1,BURMAN>刚刚那出戏抱歉了  探长
<6-1,BURMAN>I apologize for the theatrics, detective,

150
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:05,270
<6-1,BURMAN>但在这个世界  钱能激励他们
<6-1,BURMAN>but in this world, it gets results.

151
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,330
<6-2,CASTLE>我还以为
<6-2,CASTLE>And here I thought the stories

152
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:08,510
<6-2,CASTLE>那些华尔街故事太夸张了呢
<6-2,CASTLE>of wall street excess were exaggerated.

153
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:10,800
<6-3,BECKETT>波曼先生  据我所知彼得·科尔德罗
<6-3,BECKETT>Mr. Berman, I understand that Peter Cordero

154
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,450
<6-3,BECKETT>是你的直属下属
<6-3,BECKETT>reported directly to you.

<6-4,BURMAN>对  他是我手下最好的期货操盘手

<6-4,BURMAN>是我见过的最好的人
<6-4,BURMAN>And one of the nicest guys you'll ever meet.

157
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,290
<6-4,BURMAN>至少是在这个圈子里
<6-4,BURMAN>In this part of the world, anyway.

158
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:19,420
<6-4,BURMAN>你们有什么线索了吗
<6-4,BURMAN>Do you have any leads?

159
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,580
<6-5,BECKETT>只有一个
<6-5,BECKETT>Uh, just one.

<6-5,BECKETT>你认识这个女人吗
<6-5,BECKETT>Do you recognize this woman?

161
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,970
<6-6,BURMAN>不  不认识
<6-6,BURMAN>No. I'm afraid I don't.

162
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:29,810
<6-7,BECKETT>据彼得·科尔德罗的家人说
<6-7,BECKETT>Well, according to Peter Cordero's family,

163
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:32,210
<6-7,BECKETT>他在工作上遇到了麻烦
<6-7,BECKETT>he was having some trouble here at work.

164
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:33,850
<6-7,BECKETT>你知道可能是什么事吗
<6-7,BECKETT>Do you have any idea what that might have been?

165
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:34,610
<6-7,BECKETT>不知道
<6-7,BECKETT>No idea.

166
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:36,960
<6-8,BURMAN>其实  他本月业绩是最好的一个月
<6-8,BURMAN>In fact, he was having one of the best months he's ever had.

167
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:38,910
<6-9,CASTLE>那他的客户呢  有什么问题吗
<6-9,CASTLE>And what about his clients? Any problems there?

168
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:42,030
<6-10,BURMAN>他是明日之星  客户们都喜欢他
<6-10,BURMAN>Well, Pete was a rising star. His clients loved him...

169
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:43,940
<6-11,BECKETT>但是
<6-11,BECKETT>But...

170
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:45,800
<6-11,BECKETT>但是什么
<6-11,BECKETT>But what?

171
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:49,700
<6-12,BURMAN>上周  我走楼梯上65楼
<6-12,BURMAN>Last week, I was taking the stairs to the 65th floor --

172
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:51,840
<6-12,BURMAN>我的锻炼方式
<6-12,BURMAN>my version of exercise --

173
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:53,670
<6-12,BURMAN>我看到彼得在楼梯间里
<6-12,BURMAN>and I saw Peter in the stairwell

174
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:56,150
<6-12,BURMAN>跟一个看着像小混混的人在一起
<6-12,BURMAN>with this guy who looked like a gangbanger.

175
00:06:56,150 --> 00:07:00,210
<6-12,BURMAN>脖子上都是纹身  脸上有大刀疤
<6-12,BURMAN>All tatted up his neck, big scar on his cheek.

176
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,440
<6-12,BURMAN>是在这里不会看到的那种人
<6-12,BURMAN>Not the kind of guy you ever see down here.

177
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:06,160
<6-12,BURMAN>他给了彼得一个这么大的包裹
<6-12,BURMAN>And he was handing Peter a package about yea big.

178
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:10,020
<6-12,BURMAN>彼得见到我后  一副做了亏心事的样子
<6-12,BURMAN>When Peter saw me, he looked guilty as hell.

179
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,450
<6-14,BURMAN>于是我就走开了
<6-14,BURMAN>So I just kept walking.

180
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:14,340
<6-13,CASTLE>你没有问他吗
<6-13,CASTLE>And you didn't ask him about it?

181
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,400
<6-14,BURMAN>我后来问了
<6-14,BURMAN>Yeah, I did later,

182
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:18,890
<6-14,BURMAN>但他说没事  我就没管
<6-14,BURMAN>but he said it was nothing, so I just let it go.

183
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:20,910
<6-15,BECKETT>你在楼梯间里看到了小混混
<6-15,BECKETT>You saw a gangbanger in your stairwell,

184
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:22,670
<6-15,BECKETT>结果什么都不管
<6-15,BECKETT>and you just let it go?

185
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:25,500
<6-16,BURMAN>这是一个高压环境  探长
<6-16,BURMAN>This is a high-stress environment, detective.

186
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:27,040
<6-16,BURMAN>我们不问那么多
<6-16,BURMAN>We don't ask a lot of questions

187
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,560
<6-16,BURMAN>不打听员工做了什么  来撑过每一天
<6-16,BURMAN>about what our people do to -- to get through the day.

188
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:33,300
<6-17,BECKETT>好吧  你能跟画像师描述一下那个人吗
<6-17,BECKETT>Okay. Do you think you can describe him to a sketch artist?

189
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,130
<6-18,BURMAN>可以的
<6-18,BURMAN>I think so.

190
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:37,440
<6-19,BECKETT>好的  我需要彼得所有同事的名字
<6-19,BECKETT>Great. I need the names of all of Peter's associates here at work.

191
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,180
<6-20,BURMAN>当然
<6-20,BURMAN>Of course.

192
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:40,320
<6-21,BECKETT>蕾妮有新发现
<6-21,BECKETT>Lanie's got something for us.

193
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,790
<7-1,LANIE>仍然没有自卫伤的迹象
<7-1,LANIE>Still no indication of defensive wounds,

194
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:47,360
<7-1,LANIE>但我在查他指甲里的DNA时发现了这个
<7-1,LANIE>but I did find this when I checked his nails for DNA.

195
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:51,280
<7-2,CASTLE>数字
<7-2,CASTLE>Numbers.

196
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,990
<7-2,CASTLE>7  2  3  5  9  8
<7-2,CASTLE>"7, 2, 3, 5, 9, 8."

197
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:56,840
<7-3,LANIE>他在四五天前用钢笔写的
<7-3,LANIE>He wrote it in pen I'd say four or five days ago.

198
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,760
<7-3,LANIE>但我不是为了这个才叫你们过来
<7-3,LANIE>But that's not why I called you.

199
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,600
<7-4,BECKETT>看这个
<7-4,BECKETT>Look at this.

200
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:04,340
<7-3,LANIE>在他胸口  Y型缝线的旁边
<7-3,LANIE>On his chest, next to the "Y" incision.

201
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:09,590
<7-4,BECKETT>-看什么  -很微小
<7-4,BECKETT>- Look at what? - It's subtle --

202
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:11,680
<7-5,LANIE>小得我差点都忽略了
<7-5,LANIE>so subtle, I almost missed it.

203
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,600
<7-5,LANIE>我觉得这是他衬衫被扯开的原因
<7-5,LANIE>But I think it explains why his shirt was ripped open.

204
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:17,780
<7-5,LANIE>-看到这里颗粒状的皮肤吗  -嗯
<7-5,LANIE>- You see this grainy material? - Yeah.

205
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,530
<7-7,LANIE>这是胶水残留
<7-7,LANIE>It's adhesive residue.

206
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:21,250
<7-7,LANIE>事实上  残留痕迹
<7-7,LANIE>In fact, there's a residue pattern

207
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,260
<7-7,LANIE>从肚子一直到胸口
<7-7,LANIE>from his belly to his chest.

208
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,360
<7-8,BECKETT>胶水
<7-8,BECKETT>Adhesive?

209
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,750
<7-9,LANIE>从这个痕迹看
<7-9,LANIE>Looking at the pattern,

210
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,220
<7-9,LANIE>我觉得这只华尔街之狼戴着窃听器
<7-9,LANIE>I'd say your wall street wolf was wearing a wire.

211
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:31,890
<8-1,GATES>窃听器
<8-1,GATES>A wire?

212
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:32,520
<8-1,GATES>是的  长官
<8-1,GATES>Yes, sir.

213
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:33,690
<8-2,BECKETT>我们觉得凶手射杀他之后
<8-2,BECKETT>We believe our killer removed it

214
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:35,530
<8-2,BECKETT>把窃听器从死者身上拿走了
<8-2,BECKETT>from the victim's body after shooting him.

215
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,580
<8-3,GATES>知道他是替谁戴着窃听器吗
<8-3,GATES>Do we know who he was wearing a wire for?

216
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,390
<8-4,BECKETT>我们还在
<8-4,BECKETT>Well, we're checking

217
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:40,560
<8-4,BECKETT>跟其他执法部门核对
<8-4,BECKETT>with other branches of law enforcement right now.

218
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:42,350
<8-5,GATES>这个在凶案后报警的女人呢
<8-5,GATES>What about this woman who called in the murder?

219
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:43,970
<8-5,GATES>你们查到她的身份了吗
<8-5,GATES>Have you been able to identify her?

220
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:45,480
<8-6,BECKETT>科尔德罗认识的人当中
<8-6,BECKETT>You know, no one in Cordero's life

221
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,480
<8-6,BECKETT>没有人知道她是谁
<8-6,BECKETT>seems to know who she is,

222
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,570
<8-6,BECKETT>我们也不知道该去哪找她
<8-6,BECKETT>and we have no idea where to find her.

223
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,710
<8-7,CASTLE>我觉得...她来找我们了
<8-7,CASTLE>I...think she just found us.

224
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:54,510
<8-8,GATES>天呐
<8-8,GATES>Oh, lord.

225
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,000
<8-8,GATES>我得说你们的案子变得更复杂了
<8-8,GATES>I'd say your case just got a lot more complicated.

226
00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:58,940
<8-9,BECKETT>怎么说  长官
<8-9,BECKETT>What is it, sir?

227
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,980
<8-10,GATES>她们来自联邦检察官办公室
<8-10,GATES>They're from the U.S. Attorney's office.

<8-11,CASTLE>你认识她们
<8-11,CASTLE>You know them?

229
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:03,450
<8-12,GATES>不认识照片里的女人
<8-12,GATES>Uh, not the woman from the photo,

230
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:05,530
<8-12,GATES>但她旁边的那个叫伊丽莎白·韦斯顿
<8-12,GATES>but the woman with her is Elizabeth Weston,

246
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,310
<9-4,STEPHANIE GOLDMARK>我们为了科尔德罗被杀一案而来
<9-4,STEPHANIE GOLDMARK>We're here about the Cordero murder.

247
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,030
<9-5,GATES>那就有趣了
<9-5,GATES>Oh, well, that's funny,

248
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:41,620
<9-5,GATES>因为我们对此也有许多疑问
<9-5,GATES>because we have a few questions about that ourselves.

249
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,890
<9-6,BECKETT>首先  葛马科女士
<9-6,BECKETT>Starting, Ms. Goldmark,

250
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:44,370
<9-6,BECKETT>你用公共电话报警时
<9-6,BECKETT>with why you didn't identify yourself

251
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:47,100
<9-6,BECKETT>为什么不肯透露自己的身份
<9-6,BECKETT>when you made that 911 call from the pay phone.

252
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:51,580
<9-7,WESTON>因为我让她别透露的
<9-7,WESTON>Because I instructed her not to.

253
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,980
<9-7,WESTON>我不能暴露我们的调查
<9-7,WESTON>I couldn't afford to compromise our investigation.

254
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:56,410
<9-8,CASTLE>什么调查
<9-8,CASTLE>What investigation?

255
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:01,260
<9-9,WESTON>我们能找个地方私下谈吗
<9-9,WESTON>Is there somewhere private we can talk?

256
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:06,210
<10-1,GATES>伊丽莎白  到底是什么事
<10-1,GATES>All right, Elizabeth, what's this all about?

257
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,500
<10-2,WESTON>死者是我们的秘密线人
<10-2,WESTON>Your victim was a confidential informant for my office

258
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,640
<10-2,WESTON>我们在对哈丁集团进行刑事调查
<10-2,WESTON>in an ongoing criminal investigation of JP Harding.

259
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:15,380
<10-3,BECKETT>所以科尔德罗戴着窃听器
<10-3,BECKETT>Which is why Cordero was wearing a wire.

260
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:18,060
<10-4,GOLDMARK>对  因为哈丁集团在65楼
<10-4,GOLDMARK>Yes, and since JP Harding is on the 65th floor,

261
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,530
<10-4,GOLDMARK>所以我们无法实时监控
<10-4,GOLDMARK>we couldn't monitor it live.

262
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:22,360
<10-4,GOLDMARK>科尔德罗每天早上戴上  晚上上交
<10-4,GOLDMARK>Cordero put it on every morning and turned it in every night,

263
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,180
<10-4,GOLDMARK>连同相应的录音设备
<10-4,GOLDMARK>along with the attached recording device.

264
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,860
<10-5,CASTLE>但昨晚他没有上交
<10-5,CASTLE>Only last night, he didn't.

265
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,580
<10-6,GOLDMARK>我去他的公寓查看情况
<10-6,GOLDMARK>I went to his apartment to see what happened.

266
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,250
<10-6,GOLDMARK>于是发现他死了  窃听器也不在了
<10-6,GOLDMARK>That's when I found him, and the wire was gone.

267
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:32,840
<10-7,WESTON>我们认为窃听器录下了
<10-7,WESTON>We think that there was something key

268
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,190
<10-7,WESTON>对我们调查很关键的信息
<10-7,WESTON>to our investigation on that wire

269
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:35,640
<10-7,WESTON>而他也因此被杀
<10-7,WESTON>and that's why he was killed.

270
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:36,960
<10-7,WESTON>你们掌握了什么线索
<10-7,WESTON>So where are you on leads?

271
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:41,440
<10-8,BECKETT>弹道科在查子弹的来历
<10-8,BECKETT>Well, uh, ballistics is running the slug,

272
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,110
<10-8,BECKETT>但目前的线索只有这个画像
<10-8,BECKETT>but right now the only lead is this sketch,

273
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:46,200
<10-8,BECKETT>由科尔德罗先生的老板杰米·波曼提供
<10-8,BECKETT>provided by Mr. Cordero's boss, Jamie Berman.

274
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,270
<10-8,BECKETT>他看到过这个人和被害人一起
<10-8,BECKETT>It's of a man he saw with our victim.

275
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:50,850
<10-9,WESTON>还是别太相信这个画像
<10-9,WESTON>Well, I wouldn't put much credence in that sketch.

276
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,080
<10-10,GATES>为什么
<10-10,GATES>Why? Why is that?

277
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:54,700
<10-11,WESTON>因为波曼是我们这次调查的目标
<10-11,WESTON>Because Berman is the target of our investigation.

278
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:57,750
<10-12,CASTLE>杰米·波曼  哈丁集团的负责人
<10-12,CASTLE>Jamie Berman, head of JP Harding?

279
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,780
<10-13,WESTON>我们试图立案起诉他很多年了
<10-13,WESTON>We've been trying to mount a case against him for years --

280
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,570
<10-13,WESTON>内线交易  证券欺诈
<10-13,WESTON>Insider trading, securities fraud.

281
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:02,720
<10-13,WESTON>我们知道他做了
<10-13,WESTON>We know he's doing it.

282
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,500
<10-13,WESTON>但一直没拿到证据
<10-13,WESTON>We just haven't been able to get proof.

283
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,400
<10-14,GOLDMARK>除非能够打入内部
<10-14,GOLDMARK>Not without getting inside.

284
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,670
<10-14,GOLDMARK>波曼很谨慎
<10-14,GOLDMARK>Berman's too careful.

285
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:09,410
<10-14,GOLDMARK>上个月我们有了突破口
<10-14,GOLDMARK>Then, last month, we caught a break.

286
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:11,830
<10-14,GOLDMARK>彼得·科尔德罗在一次盘查中
<10-14,GOLDMARK>Peter Cordero was found with a baggie of cocaine

287
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:13,160
<10-14,GOLDMARK>被搜出一袋可卡因
<10-14,GOLDMARK>during a stop-and-frisk.

288
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,660
<10-14,GOLDMARK>由于他还是青少年时就持有过毒品
<10-14,GOLDMARK>With his priors for possession when he was a teen,

289
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,090
<10-14,GOLDMARK>他面临着5到10年的监禁
<10-14,GOLDMARK>he was facing 5 to 10.

290
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,950
<10-15,GATES>你们让科尔德罗和你们合作
<10-15,GATES>You got Cordero to play ball.

291
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:20,890
<10-16,WESTON>他欣然同意了豁免协议
<10-16,WESTON>He jumped at an immunity deal.

292
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:22,840
<10-16,WESTON>他已经掌握了一些有价值的信息
<10-16,WESTON>He'd already gotten valuable information

293
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,980
<10-16,WESTON>存在窃听录音器里
<10-16,WESTON>on his wire recordings.

294
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,760
<10-16,WESTON>但是昨天  他本来应该
<10-16,WESTON>But yesterday, he was scheduled

295
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,480
<10-16,WESTON>和波曼单独面谈
<10-16,WESTON>to meet with Berman one-on-one.

296
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,830
<10-16,WESTON>逼他说出他干的一些勾当
<10-16,WESTON>He was gonna push him to open up about some of his deals.

297
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,600
<10-17,GOLDMARK>科尔德罗可能逼太紧了
<10-17,GOLDMARK>Cordero may have pushed too hard.

298
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:34,910
<10-17,GOLDMARK>我们认为波曼在会面时识破了科尔德罗
<10-17,GOLDMARK>We think Berman made Cordero in that meeting.

299
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,830
<10-18,BECKETT>所以你们认为杰米·波曼
<10-18,BECKETT>So you think Jamie Berman's somehow responsible

300
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:38,860
<10-18,BECKETT>与科尔德罗的死有关
<10-18,BECKETT>for Cordero's death?

301
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:39,870
<10-19,WESTON>是的  如果波曼知道
<10-19,WESTON>Well, if Berman knew

302
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,880
<10-19,WESTON>自己在录音带上供认了罪行
<10-19,WESTON>he had incriminated himself on tape...

303
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,960
<10-20,CASTLE>他会不惜一切把它夺回来的
<10-20,CASTLE>He'd go to any lengths to get it back.

304
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:47,190
<10-21,WESTON>维多利亚  调查还在继续
<10-21,WESTON>Victoria, this investigation is ongoing,

305
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,500
<10-21,WESTON>如果将消息透露给波曼或哈丁集团的人
<10-21,WESTON>and exposing it to Mr. Berman or anyone at JP Harding

306
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,320
<10-21,WESTON>就会违反联邦法律
<10-21,WESTON>would break federal statutes.

307
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,220
<10-21,WESTON>但我觉得你和你的团队
<10-21,WESTON>But I thought that this was something

308
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,920
<10-21,WESTON>必须知道这些事
<10-21,WESTON>that you and your team needed to know.

309
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,050
<10-22,GATES>那是当然
<10-22,GATES>I'd certainly say so.

310
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,180
<10-23,WESTON>那么如果案件的调查出现了重大进展
<10-23,WESTON>So I trust that you will keep my office in the loop

311
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:03,460
<10-23,WESTON>你们一定会通知我们
<10-23,WESTON>if there are any... significant developments.

312
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,590
<10-23,WESTON>清楚了吗
<10-23,WESTON>Is that clear?

313
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,150
<10-24,GATES>当然
<10-24,GATES>Of course.

314
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:16,330
<10-25,BECKETT>长官  我不知道你还有个妹妹
<10-25,BECKETT>Sir, I didn't -- I didn't know you had a sister.

315
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,740
<10-26,GATES>现在你知道了
<10-26,GATES>Oh, well, now you do.

316
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:27,460
<11-1,BECKETT>南部地区的联邦检察官
<11-1,BECKETT>U.S. Attorney for the southern district?

317
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,590
<11-1,BECKETT>这可不是什么小事
<11-1,BECKETT>That's a really big deal.

318
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,030
<11-2,CASTLE>为什么盖茨以前从没有提过她
<11-2,CASTLE>Why hasn't Gates ever mentioned her before?

319
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:33,980
<11-3,BECKETT>不知道  但她们之间
<11-3,BECKETT>I don't know, but there was definitely a subtle chill

320
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,070
<11-3,BECKETT>绝对有点僵
<11-3,BECKETT>between the two of them.

321
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:36,200
<11-3,BECKETT>有点僵
<11-3,BECKETT>"A subtle chill"?

322
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:38,330
<11-4,CASTLE>我看是极地漩涡
<11-4,CASTLE>More like a polar vortex.

323
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,810
<11-4,CASTLE>我猜她们俩过去应该发生了点什么
<11-4,CASTLE>I'm guessing something happened between them in the past --

324
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,470
<11-4,CASTLE>十分私人的事
<11-4,CASTLE>Something deeply personal

325
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:45,610
<11-4,CASTLE>盖茨不愿我们知道
<11-4,CASTLE>that Gates does not want us to know about.

326
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,210
<11-4,CASTLE>如果你去问她我就给你一美金
<11-4,CASTLE>I'll give you a dollar if you ask her.

327
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:49,730
<11-6,CASTLE>-才不  -别这样  你不好奇吗
<11-6,CASTLE>- No way. - Come on. Aren't you curious?

328
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:51,730
<11-7,BECKETT>好奇啊  但我太喜欢我的工作了
<11-7,BECKETT>Yeah, but I like my job too much.

329
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:55,030
<11-7,BECKETT>联邦检察官的说法可能有点靠谱
<11-7,BECKETT>Hey, so, uh, there may be something to the U.S. Attorney's theory.

330
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,260
<11-8,RYAN>我查了一下科尔德罗的日历
<11-8,RYAN>I checked Cordero's calendar.

331
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,580
<11-8,RYAN>他昨天下午五点的确安排了
<11-8,RYAN>He was scheduled to meet with Berman

332
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,910
<11-8,RYAN>和波曼会面
<11-8,RYAN>at 5 p.m. yesterday.

333
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:01,220
<11-8,RYAN>不管他们说了什么  情况有点不妙
<11-8,RYAN>And whatever they talked about, it got heated.

334
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:02,210
<11-9,BECKETT>你怎么知道的
<11-9,BECKETT>How do you know that?

335
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:03,310
<11-10,RYAN>根据楼层的监控录像
<11-10,RYAN>According to building security,

336
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:05,060
<11-10,RYAN>两人很快就离开了
<11-10,RYAN>the two of them left shortly after

337
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,360
<11-10,RYAN>并且看起来像起了争执
<11-10,RYAN>and seemed to be in the middle of a fight.

338
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:16,190
<12-1,BURMAN>是的  彼得和我昨天说过话
<12-1,BURMAN>Yeah, Peter and I had words yesterday.

339
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:17,030
<12-1,BURMAN>怎么了
<12-1,BURMAN>So what?

340
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,470
<12-2,BECKETT>今天早上我们谈话的时候
<12-2,BECKETT>So, you didn't tell us about that

341
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:20,900
<12-2,BECKETT>-你没告诉我们  -因为这不相关
<12-2,BECKETT>- when we talked this morning. - 'Cause it wasn't relevant.

342
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:22,150
<12-4,CASTLE>怎么不相关呢
<12-4,CASTLE>How is it not relevant?

343
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:23,510
<12-4,CASTLE>录像显示你们俩同时离开
<12-4,CASTLE>The video shows you leaving together.

344
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:24,850
<12-4,CASTLE>两小时后  他就死了
<12-4,CASTLE>Two hours later, he's dead.

345
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:27,130
<12-5,BURMAN>不相关是因为我没有杀他
<12-5,BURMAN>It's not relevant because I didn't kill him.

346
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,760
<12-5,BURMAN>说真的  探长  我有什么动机呢
<12-5,BURMAN>Honestly, detective, what would be my motive?

347
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:34,270
<12-6,BECKETT>你们俩到底为什么起了争执
<12-6,BECKETT>What exactly were the two of you arguing about?

348
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:35,370
<12-7,BURMAN>一笔生意
<12-7,BURMAN>A business deal.

349
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,270
<12-8,CASTLE>为一笔生意的话  你太激动了吧
<12-8,CASTLE>You looked pretty worked up for a business deal.

350
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,200
<12-9,BURMAN>这笔生意很重要
<12-9,BURMAN>There was a lot riding on it.

351
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:41,550
<12-10,BECKETT>什么生意
<12-10,BECKETT>What was the deal?

352
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:44,010
<12-11,BURMAN>客户隐私  探长
<12-11,BURMAN>Client confidentiality, detective.

353
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:45,920
<12-11,BURMAN>我不能说
<12-11,BURMAN>I'm not at liberty to discuss it.

354
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,020
<12-12,CASTLE>你和彼得在此之前会过面
<12-12,CASTLE>You had a meeting with Peter before that.

355
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,310
<12-12,CASTLE>你们那时候在谈什么
<12-12,CASTLE>What were you speaking about then?

356
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,310
<12-13,BURMAN>其他的财务问题
<12-13,BURMAN>Other financial matters.

357
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:52,640
<12-14,CASTLE>什么样的财务问题
<12-14,CASTLE>What kind of financial matters?

358
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,360
<12-15,BURMAN>敏感的问题  任何对此的探讨
<12-15,BURMAN>Sensitive ones, any discussion of which,

359
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,990
<12-15,BURMAN>即使是跟执法部门
<12-15,BURMAN>even with law enforcement,

360
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:59,040
<12-15,BURMAN>都可能被认为是内线交易
<12-15,BURMAN>would be considered insider trading.

361
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,500
<12-15,BURMAN>除非你们有法院的传票
<12-15,BURMAN>So unless you have a subpoena --

362
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,760
<12-16,BECKETT>还有谁参加了会面
<12-16,BECKETT>Who else was at the meeting?

363
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:03,450
<12-17,BURMAN>只有我们俩
<12-17,BURMAN>Just the two of us.

364
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:05,060
<12-18,BECKETT>你离开大厅之后去了哪里
<12-18,BECKETT>And what did you do after you left the lobby?

365
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:07,950
<12-19,BURMAN>我们沿着拉菲尔街往上走到喷泉就分开了
<12-19,BURMAN>Oh, we walked up Lafayette and parted ways around spring.

366
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:08,870
<12-20,BECKETT>那时候几点
<12-20,BECKETT>What time was that?

367
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,140
<12-21,BURMAN>6点15左右
<12-21,BURMAN>Around 6:15.

368
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,770
<12-22,BECKETT>你八点到十点间去了哪里
<12-22,BECKETT>Where were you between 8:00 and 10:00?

369
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,690
<12-23,BURMAN>坐在马戏团餐厅我平时的座位上
<12-23,BURMAN>At my usual table at le cirque.

370
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:14,920
<12-23,BURMAN>你们可以去查
<12-23,BURMAN>Feel free to check.

371
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:16,530
<12-24,NEAL>时间到了
<12-24,NEAL>It's time.

372
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:18,790
<12-25,BURMAN>抱歉
<12-25,BURMAN>Now, if you'll excuse me,

373
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:21,620
<12-25,BURMAN>我和美联储有个电话会议
<12-25,BURMAN>I have a conference call with the Fed.

374
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:25,540
<12-25,BURMAN>对了  如果你还想找我  探长
<12-25,BURMAN>Oh, and if you want to talk to me again, detective,

375
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:26,820
<12-25,BURMAN>给我的律师打电话
<12-25,BURMAN>call my lawyer.

376
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:34,280
<13-1,BECKETT>马戏团餐厅确认波曼
<13-1,BECKETT>Le cirque confirms that Berman was there

377
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,900
<13-1,BECKETT>8点到10点25都在那儿
<13-1,BECKETT>8:00 p.m. till 10:25.

378
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,270
<13-1,BECKETT>不可能是他
<13-1,BECKETT>Couldn't have been him.

379
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,610
<13-2,CASTLE>因为像波曼那样的人不会自己动手
<13-2,CASTLE>'Cause a guy like berman isn't gonna get his hands dirty.

380
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:41,920
<13-2,CASTLE>他肯定雇了别人
<13-2,CASTLE>He's gonna hire someone.

381
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,680
<13-2,CASTLE>你妹妹是对的  波曼是幕后黑手
<13-2,CASTLE>No, your sister's right. Berman is behind this.

382
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,060
<13-2,CASTLE>说到你妹妹
<13-2,CASTLE>And speaking of your sister --

383
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:46,930
<13-2,CASTLE>打住
<13-2,CASTLE>Let's not.

384
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:49,500
<13-3,GATES>如果波曼是幕后黑手
<13-3,GATES>If Berman is behind this,

385
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,510
<13-3,GATES>他会用尽一切手段来保护自己
<13-3,GATES>he will do everything he can to protect himself.

386
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,200
<13-4,BECKETT>知道联邦政府的人在监视他
<13-4,BECKETT>Knowing that the Feds are watching him,

387
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,930
<13-4,BECKETT>他肯定会小心翼翼地隐藏自己
<13-4,BECKETT>he would be careful to cover his tracks.

388
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:58,200
<13-4,BECKETT>要查到他身上简直不可能
<13-4,BECKETT>It's gonna be next to impossible to trace this back to him.

389
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,550
<13-5,CASTLE>那我们现在能确定的就是
<13-5,CASTLE>So, all we're really sure of

390
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:01,080
<13-5,CASTLE>他给我们的这个画像
<13-5,CASTLE>is that the sketch he gave us

391
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,390
<13-5,CASTLE>是个虚构的陷阱
<13-5,CASTLE>is a load of fictitious crap

392
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:03,860
<13-5,CASTLE>用来误导我们的调查方向
<13-5,CASTLE>meant to send us in the wrong direction.

393
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,840
<13-6,ESPOSITO>素描不是虚构的
<13-6,ESPOSITO>It's not as fictitious as you think.

394
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:08,470
<13-6,ESPOSITO>我刚拿到杀科尔德罗那把枪的弹道报告
<13-6,ESPOSITO>I just got the ballistics back on the bullet that killed Cordero.

395
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,200
<13-6,ESPOSITO>弹痕和三个月前布朗克斯区一家酒馆的
<13-6,ESPOSITO>Striations match a slug that was pulled from a robbery shooting

396
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,370
<13-6,ESPOSITO>抢劫枪击案的子弹相符
<13-6,ESPOSITO>at a bodega in the Bronx three months ago.

397
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,090
<13-6,ESPOSITO>警方的证据不足以立案
<13-6,ESPOSITO>The detectives couldn't make a case,

398
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:18,030
<13-6,ESPOSITO>但三个最可能的疑犯都是帮派成员
<13-6,ESPOSITO>but their three best suspects were gang members,

399
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:19,380
<13-7,CASTLE>包括这个人
<13-7,CASTLE>including this guy.

400
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,720
<13-8,GATES>-同一个人  -同一把枪
<13-8,GATES>- Same guy. - Same gun.

401
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,390
<13-9,BECKETT>海克托·努涅斯
<13-9,BECKETT>Hector Nunez?

402
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,930
<13-10,ESPOSITO>对  掌控着卡瓦列罗斯帮派的布朗克斯南部地区
<13-10,ESPOSITO>Yeah, runs the south Bronx territory of los Caballeros gang.

403
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:28,230
<13-10,ESPOSITO>前科包括暴力袭击  杀人未遂
<13-10,ESPOSITO>Priors include assault, attempted manslaughter,

404
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,770
<13-10,ESPOSITO>以及合谋分销可卡因
<13-10,ESPOSITO>and conspiracy to distribute cocaine.

405
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:34,840
<14-1,MARIA>不  你搞错了
<14-1,MARIA>No, you're wrong.

406
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:37,970
<14-1,MARIA>彼得从不沾染可卡因  他厌恶毒品
<14-1,MARIA>Peter had nothing to do with cocaine. He hated drugs.

407
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:40,230
<14-2,BECKETT>你知道上个月他因为持有毒品被捕吗
<14-2,BECKETT>Do you know he was arrested last month for possession?

408
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,850
<14-3,MARIA>不可能  我了解彼得
<14-3,MARIA>That's impossible. I know Peter.

409
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,120
<14-3,MARIA>他不可能吸毒的
<14-3,MARIA>He'd never use that stuff.

410
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,640
<14-4,BECKETT>玛利亚  你确定吗
<14-4,BECKETT>Are you sure, Maria?

411
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:49,360
<14-4,BECKETT>上星期有人看到这个男人给了他一个包裹
<14-4,BECKETT>Because he was seen receiving a package last week from this guy.

412
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,680
<14-5,MARIA>不  不  这不可能
<14-5,MARIA>No. No. It -- it can't be.

413
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,860
<14-6,CASTLE>你认得他吗
<14-6,CASTLE>Do you recognize him?

414
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:56,640
<14-6,CASTLE>他是海克托·努涅斯
<14-6,CASTLE>Hector Nunez.

415
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:58,250
<14-7,MARIA>是彼得从小玩到大的好朋友
<14-7,MARIA>He was Peter's best friend growing up.

416
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,680
<14-7,MARIA>但他后来进了帮派
<14-7,MARIA>But then he got mixed up in a gang,

417
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,520
<14-7,MARIA>也想把彼得拉进去
<14-7,MARIA>And he tried to drag Peter in, too.

418
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:05,250
<14-7,MARIA>后来海克托就变了  变得危险
<14-7,MARIA>Afterwards, Hector changed. He became dangerous.

419
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:07,890
<14-7,MARIA>彼得在十多年前就和他撇清关系了
<14-7,MARIA>Peter cut ties with him over a decade ago.

420
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:11,790
<14-8,CASTLE>你知道为什么他和彼得又牵扯上了吗
<14-8,CASTLE>Can you think of any reason why he'd be back in Peter's life?

421
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,000
<14-9,MARIA>海克托是个恶魔
<14-9,MARIA>Hector was a devil.

422
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,250
<14-9,MARIA>彼得根本不会再和他牵扯不清的
<14-9,MARIA>Peter would have never gotten mixed up with him again...

423
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,550
<14-10,MARIA>除非是万不得已
<14-10,MARIA>...unless he didn't have a choice.

424
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:30,320
<15-1,CASTLE>这里和华尔街真是相去甚远呐
<15-1,CASTLE>This is a long way from Wall Street.

425
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,010
<15-2,BECKETT>这说不通啊  如果彼得真吸毒了
<15-2,BECKETT>This doesn't make any sense. If Peter was into drugs,

426
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:36,000
<15-2,BECKETT>他肯定有钱从市区买毒品
<15-2,BECKETT>he had enough money to get them from downtown.

427
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,280
<15-2,BECKETT>明知道海克托很危险
<15-2,BECKETT>Why would he risk getting them

428
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,440
<15-2,BECKETT>为什么还从他那儿买毒品呢
<15-2,BECKETT>from someone that he knew was dangerous?

429
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,600
<15-3,CASTLE>就是这儿  热舞乐部
<15-3,CASTLE>There it is -- el baile club.

430
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,600
<15-4,BECKETT>卡瓦列罗斯帮派的非官方集聚地
<15-4,BECKETT>Yeah, unofficial headquarters of los Caballeros.

431
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:46,410
<15-4,BECKETT>跟紧我
<15-4,BECKETT>Stick close.

432
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:48,530
<15-4,BECKETT>如果海克托真像传言的那么危险
<15-4,BECKETT>If Hector's as dangerous as advertised,

433
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:49,960
<15-4,BECKETT>可能会有些麻烦
<15-4,BECKETT>things might get a little hairy.

434
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,450
<15-5,CASTLE>麻烦[多毛]是我的专长
<15-5,CASTLE>Hairy's my middle name.

435
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,920
<15-5,CASTLE>这话讲出来不如心里想的那么好
<15-5,CASTLE>That sounded a lot better in my head.

436
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,950
<16-1,CASTLE>你确定我们没走错吧
<16-1,CASTLE>Are you sure this is the right place?

437
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,360
<16-1,CASTLE>那些人看起来不像危险人物
<16-1,CASTLE>Those guys don't look very dangerous.

438
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,590
<16-2,BECKETT>那些人呢
<16-2,BECKETT>What about those guys?

439
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,860
<16-3,CASTLE>那些荷枪实弹的啊
<16-3,CASTLE>Ah, you mean the heavily-armed ones.

440
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,180
<16-4,BECKETT>我们要找海克托·努涅斯
<16-4,BECKETT>We're looking for Hector Nunez.

442
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:34,250
<16-5,CASTLE>海克托·努涅斯
<16-5,CASTLE>Hector Nunez?

443
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,140
<16-6,BECKETT>我是贝克特探长  纽约警局
<16-6,BECKETT>Detective Beckett, NYPD.

444
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:42,290
<16-7,HECTOR NUNEZ>探长  你不该来这儿的  受伤就不好了
<16-7,HECTOR NUNEZ>Detective, you shouldn't be here. You could get hurt.

445
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:44,440
<16-7,HECTOR NUNEZ>这附近不大安全
<16-7,HECTOR NUNEZ>It's a dangerous neighborhood.

446
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,880
<16-8,BECKETT>也许我该把你带到我的地盘问话
<16-8,BECKETT>Yeah, well, maybe I should take you down to my neighborhood.

447
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:49,270
<16-9,NUNEZ>给你省点时间吧
<16-9,NUNEZ>Let me save you some time.

448
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,930
<16-9,NUNEZ>不管你想问什么  我都没做过
<16-9,NUNEZ>Whatever it is, I didn't do it.

449
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,640
<16-10,BECKETT>那你也没听过一个叫彼得·科尔德罗的人了
<16-10,BECKETT>And I suppose you've never heard of a Peter Cordero, either.

450
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,790
<16-11,NUNEZ>彼得怎么了
<16-11,NUNEZ>What about Peter?

451
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:00,080
<16-12,BECKETT>他死了
<16-12,BECKETT>He's dead.

452
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:09,640
<17-1,NUNEZ>谁干的
<17-1,NUNEZ>Who did this?

453
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,280
<17-2,CASTLE>我们以为是你...
<17-2,CASTLE>Well, we were thinking you...

454
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:15,950
<17-2,CASTLE>...你也许你能告诉我们
<17-2,CASTLE>...might...be able to... tell us.

455
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:17,870
<17-3,NUNEZ>我绝不会伤害彼得
<17-3,NUNEZ>I'd never hurt peter.

456
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,300
<17-3,NUNEZ>他曾是我最好的朋友
<17-3,NUNEZ>He was my best friend.

457
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:22,840
<17-3,NUNEZ>我们小时候  帮派想招募他
<17-3,NUNEZ>When we were kids and the gang wanted to take him,

458
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:23,830
<17-3,NUNEZ>我阻止了
<17-3,NUNEZ>I wouldn't let them.

459
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:24,930
<17-3,NUNEZ>我知道他能拥有更好的生活
<17-3,NUNEZ>I knew he could do better.

460
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:30,380
<17-4,BECKETT>那他怎么会被你的枪射杀呢
<17-4,BECKETT>So how did he end up shot and killed with your gun?

461
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,530
<17-5,NUNEZ>他出了什么事
<17-5,NUNEZ>Something was going on with him.

462
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,480
<17-5,NUNEZ>上周他时隔多年头一次打电话找我
<17-5,NUNEZ>He called me last week -- first time in years.

463
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:36,460
<17-5,NUNEZ>说他在做什么能赚钱的买卖
<17-5,NUNEZ>Said he was into some deal that was gonna make him rich,

464
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:37,860
<17-5,NUNEZ>但很危险
<17-5,NUNEZ>but it was dangerous.

465
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,750
<17-5,NUNEZ>他需要保护自己  以防出事
<17-5,NUNEZ>In case something went wrong, he needed to protect himself.

466
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:42,520
<17-5,NUNEZ>他说要一把武器
<17-5,NUNEZ>He said he need a weapon.

467
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:44,270
<17-6,CASTLE>你是说你把那把枪给了他
<17-6,CASTLE>You're saying you gave him that gun?

468
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:45,800
<17-7,NUNEZ>对  他说他一直被监视
<17-7,NUNEZ>Well, he said he couldn't buy one himself

469
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,350
<17-7,NUNEZ>不能自己去买枪
<17-7,NUNEZ>'cause he was being watched all the time.

470
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,110
<17-8,BECKETT>你在楼梯间给他的包裹里就是枪吗
<17-8,BECKETT>Was that what was in the package you gave him in the stairwell?

471
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:52,630
<17-9,NUNEZ>嗯
<17-9,NUNEZ>Yeah.

472
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:55,540
<17-10,BECKETT>他所说的买卖是毒品吗
<17-10,BECKETT>That deal that he was into -- was it drugs?

473
00:18:56,250 --> 00:19:00,040
<17-11,NUNEZ>不是毒品  是钱  和银行账户有关
<17-11,NUNEZ>Not drugs, money. Something to do with bank accounts.

474
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:01,550
<17-12,CASTLE>银行账户
<17-12,CASTLE>"Bank accounts"?

475
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:04,140
<17-13,NUNEZ>上周四夜里  他来找我
<17-13,NUNEZ>Last Thursday night, he came to me,

476
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,160
<17-13,NUNEZ>要我最后再帮他个忙
<17-13,NUNEZ>said he needed one last favor.

477
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:10,700
<17-13,NUNEZ>让我把一个信封交给市中心什么银行的经理
<17-13,NUNEZ>He wanted me to take an envelope to a manager at some bank in midtown

478
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,140
<17-13,NUNEZ>好像是瑞士联邦银行什么的
<17-13,NUNEZ>Suisse Federal or something.

479
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:15,910
<17-14,CASTLE>他为什么不自己去呢  为什么让你去
<17-14,CASTLE>Why couldn't he just do it himself? Why would he need you?

480
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:19,030
<17-15,NUNEZ>他说不能被人看到他去银行  风险太大
<17-15,NUNEZ>Said he couldn't afford to be seen at the bank -- was too risky.

481
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:20,510
<17-16,BECKETT>信封里是什么
<17-16,BECKETT>What was in the envelope?

482
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:23,340
<17-17,NUNEZ>他说是过户指令什么的
<17-17,NUNEZ>He said something about transfer instructions.

483
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:26,120
<17-17,NUNEZ>信封封起来了  但有个银行账号
<17-17,NUNEZ>It was sealed, but there was a bank account number

484
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,410
<17-17,NUNEZ>写在信封外面
<17-17,NUNEZ>written on the outside.

485
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:28,530
<17-18,BECKETT>你记得账号吗
<17-18,BECKETT>Do you remember the number?

486
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,910
<17-19,NUNEZ>为防出事我写下来了
<17-19,NUNEZ>Wrote it down in case something went wrong.

487
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:32,780
<17-19,NUNEZ>还真出事了
<17-19,NUNEZ>I guess it did.

488
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:39,310
<17-20,CASTLE>不是他右手上写的六位数字
<17-20,CASTLE>Not the same six-digit number that was on his hand.

489
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,830
<17-21,NUNEZ>我把信封送去银行之后
<17-21,NUNEZ>After I took the envelope to the bank,

490
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,370
<17-21,NUNEZ>我打电话给彼得告诉他送到了
<17-21,NUNEZ>I called Peter at work to confirm it was done.

491
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,780
<17-21,NUNEZ>那是我们最后一次通话
<17-21,NUNEZ>That's the last time we talked.

492
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,400
<18-1,BECKETT>海克托的不在场证明确认了
<18-1,BECKETT>Hector's alibi checks out.

493
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:54,530
<18-1,BECKETT>彼得被杀时
<18-1,BECKETT>He was at lady of mercy

494
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:57,950
<18-1,BECKETT>他在仁慈圣母养老院看望他母亲
<18-1,BECKETT>nursing home visiting his mom when Peter was killed.

495
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,070
<18-2,CASTLE>神秘的财务交易
<18-2,CASTLE>Mysterious financial transactions,

496
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,500
<18-2,CASTLE>需要用到枪的危险买卖
<18-2,CASTLE>a deal so dangerous he needed a gun...

497
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,030
<18-2,CASTLE>我觉得你妹妹的重要证人
<18-2,CASTLE>Seem to me there's a lot more

498
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,110
<18-2,CASTLE>有很多事没有告诉她
<18-2,CASTLE>to your sister's star witness than she knew.

499
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:09,210
<18-3,GATES>没告诉她还是她故意没告诉我们
<18-3,GATES>"Than she knew" or than she chose to tell us about?

500
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:10,460
<18-4,BECKETT>长官
<18-4,BECKETT>Sir?

501
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:14,090
<18-5,ESPOSITO>问过瑞士联邦银行的经理了
<18-5,ESPOSITO>Yo. Talked to the manager at Suisse Federal.

502
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:16,740
<18-5,ESPOSITO>他证实确实有那个账号
<18-5,ESPOSITO>He confirmed that a bank account with those numbers exists,

504
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,080
<18-5,ESPOSITO>但他拒绝透露任何信息
<18-5,ESPOSITO>But he refused to give out any information on it.

505
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,580
<18-6,GATES>那他有没有说这是彼得·科尔德罗的账户
<18-6,GATES>Did he at least acknowledge it was Peter Cordero's account?

506
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,840
<18-7,ESPOSITO>他没说  因为他自己也不知道
<18-7,ESPOSITO>He couldn't, because he didn't know himself.

507
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:25,890
<18-7,ESPOSITO>这是一个私密数字账户
<18-7,ESPOSITO>It's a numbered account set up for privacy,

508
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:28,240
<18-7,ESPOSITO>要访问它必须要有密码才行
<18-7,ESPOSITO>so the only way that anyone can access it is with a password.

509
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,220
<18-8,BECKETT>那我们岂不是没办法知道科尔德罗在干嘛了
<18-8,BECKETT>So there's no way to know what Cordero was doing.

510
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,230
<18-9,ESPOSITO>没办法
<18-9,ESPOSITO>No.

511
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,700
<18-9,ESPOSITO>除非
<18-9,ESPOSITO>Unless...

512
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,110
<18-10,CASTLE>六位数
<18-10,CASTLE>Six digits?

514
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,980
<18-10,CASTLE>这看起来挺像个密码的
<18-10,CASTLE>Seems kind of password-y to me.

516
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:43,650
<19-1,BECKETT>好了  念给我听
<19-1,BECKETT>Okay, read it to me.

517
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:46,890
<19-1,BECKETT>723598
<19-1,BECKETT>723598.

518
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,030
<19-3,BECKETT>快出来吧
<19-3,BECKETT>Come on.

520
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:50,870
<19-4,CASTLE>进去了
<19-4,CASTLE>We're in.

521
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,170
<19-5,CASTLE>卡塞尔  你又成功了
<19-5,CASTLE>Castle, you've done it again.

522
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:55,390
<19-6,GATES>里面有多少钱
<19-6,GATES>What's it say?

524
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,120
<19-7,BECKETT>余额是零
<19-7,BECKETT>The balance is zero dollars.

525
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,160
<19-8,ESPOSITO>零  这个看上去人畜无害
<19-8,ESPOSITO>Zero dollars? That doesn't seem very dangerous.

526
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,660
<19-9,CASTLE>感觉就像是寻宝探险的最后
<19-9,CASTLE>Feels like the end of a treasure hunt

527
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,860
<19-9,CASTLE>你打开宝箱结果里面装满了沙子
<19-9,CASTLE>where you open up the chest and it's just full of sand.

528
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:08,850
<19-10,GATES>等等  查一下努涅斯先生说他转账的那天
<19-10,GATES>Wait. Go to the day Mr. Nunez claims he did the transfer,

529
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,310
<19-10,GATES>三月二十一日
<19-10,GATES>March 21st.

531
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:15,170
<19-11,BECKETT>我的天  2500万美元
<19-11,BECKETT>Oh, my god. $25 million.

532
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:17,500
<19-12,ESPOSITO>这宝箱里装的是金沙啊
<19-12,ESPOSITO>Whoa. That's some expensive sand.

533
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,170
<19-13,BECKETT>看来这笔钱是在
<19-13,BECKETT>Looks like it came into the account

534
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:21,570
<19-13,BECKETT>前一天早上8:34转入的
<19-13,BECKETT>the day before at 8:34 in the morning,

535
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:23,420
<19-13,BECKETT>随后海克托就把这笔钱转走了
<19-13,BECKETT>and then Hector transferred it out.

536
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:27,690
<19-14,CASTLE>神秘的2500万美元转账把他害死了
<19-14,CASTLE>A secret $25 million transfer that got him killed.

537
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:30,700
<19-15,GATES>科尔德罗到底卷入什么麻烦事了
<19-15,GATES>What the hell was Cordero into?

538
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,370
<20-1,ESPOSITO>好的
<20-1,ESPOSITO>Right.

539
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:36,290
<20-2,GATES>有什么好消息吗
<20-2,GATES>Any luck?

540
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:39,150
<20-3,ESPOSITO>没  我刚和瑞士联邦银行的领导通话
<20-3,ESPOSITO>No. I just talked to the head of Suisse Federal Bank.

541
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,750
<20-3,ESPOSITO>根据国际银行管理规则
<20-3,ESPOSITO>Given international banking regulations,

542
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:41,390
<20-3,ESPOSITO>我们没办法知道
<20-3,ESPOSITO>there's no way to tell

543
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:43,210
<20-3,ESPOSITO>这笔钱是哪里来的或者汇到哪里去了
<20-3,ESPOSITO>where that money came from or were it went.

544
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:44,920
<20-4,CASTLE>这笔钱是不是科尔德罗的都无法确定
<20-4,CASTLE>Or if the money's even Cordero's.

545
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,610
<20-4,CASTLE>他也许是在帮别人转移
<20-4,CASTLE>He could have been moving it for someone else.

546
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:48,690
<20-5,BECKETT>长官  如果这笔转账是和科尔德罗的死有关
<20-5,BECKETT>Sir, if this transaction was somehow responsible

547
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:50,900
<20-5,BECKETT>而我们又无法查清它的来龙去脉
<20-5,BECKETT>for Cordero's death and we can't track it,

548
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:54,490
<20-5,BECKETT>那我们就可能永远也找不到凶手了
<20-5,BECKETT>then we may never be able to find his killer.

549
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,840
<20-6,GATES>也许还另有办法
<20-6,GATES>There may be another way.

550
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,630
<21-1,WESTON>2500万美元
<21-1,WESTON>$25 million?

551
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:02,520
<21-1,WESTON>没错
<21-1,WESTON>That's right.

552
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:05,340
<21-2,GATES>你的线人为了保密可费了不少周折
<21-2,GATES>And your informant went to a great deal of trouble to keep it secret.

553
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,480
<21-3,WESTON>那你也不知道那些钱是哪里来的
<21-3,WESTON>And you have no idea where the money came from?

554
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,460
<21-4,GATES>不  不过那些钱很可能是他被杀的原因
<21-4,GATES>No, but odds are it's what got him killed.

555
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:14,150
<21-4,GATES>伊丽莎白  如果你知道任何和这有关的
<21-4,GATES>Elizabeth, if you know anything about this...

556
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:17,000
<21-5,WESTON>我当然什么都不知道了
<21-5,WESTON>Of course I don't know anything about this.

557
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,990
<21-5,WESTON>你不相信我
<21-5,WESTON>You don't believe me.

558
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:20,880
<21-6,GATES>怪我咯
<21-6,GATES>Do you blame me?

559
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,480
<21-6,GATES>我不知道
<21-6,GATES>I didn't know.

560
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,220
<21-7,WESTON>你看他费了那么大劲隐藏这笔转账
<21-7,WESTON>And given the lengths he went to hide the transaction,

561
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:26,410
<21-7,WESTON>显示是不想让我知道
<21-7,WESTON>he clearly didn't want me to know.

562
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:27,530
<21-8,GATES>好吧
<21-8,GATES>Okay, fine.

563
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:30,310
<21-8,GATES>我需要查看彼得·科尔德罗的录音记录
<21-8,GATES>Then I'm gonna need access to Peter Cordero's wire recordings.

564
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:30,950
<21-9,WESTON>为什么
<21-9,WESTON>For what?

565
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,830
<21-10,GATES>因为那些录音记录里
<21-10,GATES>Because there may be something on those tapes

566
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:34,140
<21-10,GATES>可能有和他被害有关的内容
<21-10,GATES>that's relevant to his murder.

567
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:34,710
<21-11,WESTON>我们都查过了
<21-11,WESTON>We went through them.

568
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:36,470
<21-11,WESTON>如果有什么的话  我们会注意到的
<21-11,WESTON>If there was anything on there, we would have heard it.

569
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:38,790
<21-12,GATES>不仔细是听不到的
<21-12,GATES>Not if you weren't listening for it.

570
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:42,390
<21-13,WESTON>非常抱歉  维多利亚  那些录音记录
<21-13,WESTON>I'm sorry, Victoria, but those wire recordings

571
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:45,050
<21-13,WESTON>是一项机密调查的一部分
<21-13,WESTON>are a privileged part of a confidential investigation.

572
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:46,690
<21-13,WESTON>我不能给你查看
<21-13,WESTON>I can't give you access.

573
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:48,410
<21-13,WESTON>是不能还是不愿
<21-13,WESTON>"Can't" Or "Won't"?

574
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,510
<21-14,GATES>你觉得我是瞎了吗
<21-14,GATES>Do you think I'm blind?

575
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,430
<21-14,GATES>抓住像波曼这样厉害的人物
<21-14,GATES>Bringing down someone as big as Berman,

576
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:54,430
<21-14,GATES>你就能呼风唤雨了
<21-14,GATES>you'd be able to write your own ticket.

577
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:56,560
<21-14,GATES>市长  司法部长
<21-14,GATES>The mayor's office, Attorney General --

578
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:59,310
<21-14,GATES>你所梦想的一切一切
<21-14,GATES>Everything you always dreamed of.

579
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:01,620
<21-14,GATES>可你需要科尔德罗的证词
<21-14,GATES>But you need Cordero's testimony,

580
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:05,260
<21-14,GATES>假如他在作证的时候参与了什么非法活动
<21-14,GATES>and if he was involved in anything dirty while acting as a witness,

581
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,670
<21-14,GATES>就会毁了你整个案子
<21-14,GATES>It'd jeopardize your whole case.

582
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:08,850
<21-14,GATES>那就是为什么你不愿意给我那些录音
<21-14,GATES>That's why you won't give us those tapes --

583
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:10,740
<21-14,GATES>因为你害怕我们会找到不利的东西
<21-14,GATES>Because you're afraid of what we might find.

584
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:13,130
<21-15,WESTON>抓住像波曼那样的骗子可以震慑
<21-15,WESTON>Taking down a shark like Berman would send a signal

585
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:15,910
<21-15,WESTON>所有金融圈里的骗子们
<21-15,WESTON>to every fraudulent actor in the financial market.

586
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:18,080
<21-15,WESTON>我必须顾全大局
<21-15,WESTON>I have to think about the greater good.

587
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:19,560
<21-16,GATES>这就是你对自己说的
<21-16,GATES>Oh, is that what you tell yourself

588
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:21,180
<21-16,GATES>好睡个好觉吗
<21-16,GATES>so you can sleep at night?

589
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:26,520
<21-17,WESTON>你根本不懂这里的游戏规则  不是吗
<21-17,WESTON>You could never play the game, could you?

590
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:28,970
<21-17,WESTON>所以你只好整天困在办公室里
<21-17,WESTON>It's why you're stuck behind a desk

591
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:31,500
<21-17,WESTON>而不是统领整个纽约警局
<21-17,WESTON>instead of running the entire force down at 1 P.P.

592
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:34,130
<21-18,GATES>我才没有困在这里
<21-18,GATES>I am not stuck anywhere.

593
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:36,510
<21-18,GATES>我永远也不会为我维护法律
<21-18,GATES>And I will never, never apologize

594
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:38,970
<21-18,GATES>尽心尽力的行为而道歉
<21-18,GATES>for doing my job to the letter of the law.

595
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:42,920
<21-18,GATES>好了  快把那些录音资料给我
<21-18,GATES>Now, I'm gonna need those wire recordings.

596
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:46,090
<21-18,GATES>难道你要我向你的上级报告吗
<21-18,GATES>Or do I have to go over your head?

597
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:57,010
<21-19,WESTON>任何你找到有关的  你先跟我说
<21-19,WESTON>Anything that you find, you bring it to me first.

598
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,520
<21-19,WESTON>你明白了吗
<21-19,WESTON>Do you understand?

599
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,200
<21-19,WESTON>我不能让你又毁了
<21-19,WESTON>I will not have you screw up

600
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,290
<21-19,WESTON>我另一个案子
<21-19,WESTON>another one of my investigations.

601
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,530
<22-1,CASTLE>我们可不能邀请她
<22-1,CASTLE>Let's not put her on the list.

602
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:12,500
<22-1,CASTLE>是啊
<22-1,CASTLE>Yeah.

603
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:19,490
<22-1,CASTLE>彼得·科尔德罗
<22-1,CASTLE>录音记录

604
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,630
<22-1,CASTLE>我真为盖茨感到难过
<22-1,CASTLE>I feel bad for Gates.

605
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,850
<23-1,RYAN>我的姐妹们根本无法共处一室
<23-1,RYAN>My sisters could never work together.

606
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:28,340
<23-1,RYAN>我跟你说  她们打起来的时候  简直
<23-1,RYAN>I tell you, when the two of them went at it -- whoo!

607
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:30,400
<23-2,ESPOSITO>我不介意和盖茨的妹妹出去约会
<23-2,ESPOSITO>I wouldn't mind going out with Gates' sister.

608
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,360
<23-3,RYAN>是吗
<23-3,RYAN>Oh, yeah?

609
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,830
<23-5,RYAN>要是盖茨成了你的大姨你感觉如何
<23-5,RYAN>How'd you like having Gates as your sister-in-law?

610
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:37,730
<23-6,RYAN>怎么了
<23-6,RYAN>What?

611
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,400
<23-7,ESPOSITO>我想我是发现了点东西
<23-7,ESPOSITO>I think I got something.

612
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,720
<24-1,ESPOSITO>在3月21日  彼得·科尔德罗的监听器
<24-1,ESPOSITO>So, on March 21st, Peter Cordero's wire

613
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:45,000
<24-1,ESPOSITO>录下了海克托·努涅斯打来的电话
<24-1,ESPOSITO>picked up a phone call from Hector Nunez

614
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:47,000
<24-1,ESPOSITO>就是确认转账完成的那通
<24-1,ESPOSITO>to confirm that the transfer was done.

615
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,360
<24-1,ESPOSITO>电话是上午9:25打进来的
<24-1,ESPOSITO>The call came in at 9:25 A.M.

616
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,530
<24-2,CASTLE>这和海克托说的一致
<24-2,CASTLE>That's pretty much what Hector said.

617
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:53,530
<24-3,ESPOSITO>是的  仔细听下面两通彼得打的电话
<24-3,ESPOSITO>Yeah, but listen to the next two calls that Peter makes.

618
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,690
<24-4,ESPOSITO>他是说"我以阿曼多·加西亚的名义打电话
<24-4,ESPOSITO>He's saying, "I'm calling on behalf of Armando Garcia.

619
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:59,870
<24-4,ESPOSITO>"我想确认下他的钱已经收到了
<24-4,ESPOSITO>"I want to make sure that his money was received.

620
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:01,490
<24-4,ESPOSITO>你能确认下数量吗"
<24-4,ESPOSITO>Can you confirm the amount?"

621
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:04,790
<24-4,ESPOSITO>然后他说"谢谢"  随后挂断电话
<24-4,ESPOSITO>Then he says, "Thank you," And then hangs up.

622
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,090
<24-5,GATES>阿曼多·加西亚是什么人
<24-5,GATES>Who's Armando Garcia?

623
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:07,380
<24-6,RYAN>我向哈丁集团查过了
<24-6,RYAN>I checked with JP Harding,

624
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,140
<24-6,RYAN>他们没有客户是叫这个名字的
<24-6,RYAN>but they don't have any clients by that name.

625
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,790
<24-7,BECKETT>那就不是公司的生意伙伴了
<24-7,BECKETT>So it wasn't company business?

626
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:12,670
<24-8,ESPOSITO>不是  仔细听第二通电话
<24-8,ESPOSITO>No. Now listen to the second call.

627
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,080
<24-9,PETER>他到了吗  我是彼得·科尔德罗
<24-9,PETER>Is he in? It's Peter Cordero calling.

628
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,580
<24-10,CASTLE>所以的事情都办妥了
<24-10,CASTLE>Hey, everything's taken care of,

629
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:19,770
<24-9,PETER>不过我们时间所剩不多了
<24-9,PETER>but we're running out of time.

630
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,450
<24-9,PETER>我们得在之后几天把这事搞定
<24-9,PETER>We need to get this done in the next couple days.

631
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,740
<24-9,PETER>有问题吗
<24-9,PETER>Is that gonna be a problem?

632
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,370
<24-9,PETER>很好
<24-9,PETER>Good.

633
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:28,990
<24-10,CASTLE>一切都处理好了
<24-10,CASTLE>"Everything's taken care of" --

634
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:30,690
<24-10,CASTLE>说的一定是那两千五百万
<24-10,CASTLE>That must be about the $25 million.

635
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:33,770
<24-11,GATES>但之后几天到底要干什么
<24-11,GATES>But what exactly was getting done in the next couple of days?

636
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:35,510
<24-11,GATES>为什么会导致他被杀
<24-11,GATES>And how did it get him killed?

637
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:37,030
<24-12,BECKETT>我们得找到阿曼多·加西亚
<24-12,BECKETT>We need to find Armando Garcia.

638
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,020
<24-13,RYAN>是  但不幸的是  这名字很常见
<24-13,RYAN>Yeah. Unfortunately, it's a pretty common name.

639
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:41,500
<24-13,RYAN>光是在美国就由几百个阿曼多·加西亚
<24-13,RYAN>There are hundreds of Armando Garcias in the U.S. Alone.

640
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,530
<24-13,RYAN>很难缩小范围
<24-13,RYAN>It's gonna be hard to narrow it down.

641
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:44,680
<24-14,BECKETT>除非我们能查出他打给了谁
<24-14,BECKETT>Unless we can find out who he was calling.

642
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,770
<24-14,BECKETT>9点25分时  彼得应该在工作
<24-14,BECKETT>At 9:25, Peter would have been at work.

643
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:48,900
<24-14,BECKETT>他应该是用办公桌上的电话打的
<24-14,BECKETT>He would've made those phone calls from his desk phone.

644
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:49,810
<24-15,ESPOSITO>如果我们能拿到通话记录
<24-15,ESPOSITO>If we can get those phone records,

645
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:51,860
<24-15,ESPOSITO>说不定就能知道他被卷入了什么事
<24-15,ESPOSITO>they could tell us what he was involved in.

646
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:53,840
<24-16,GATES>我去申请搜查令
<24-16,GATES>I'll put in for a warrant.

647
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,550
<24-16,GATES>希望上午前就能拿到
<24-16,GATES>Hopefully, we'll get it by morning.

648
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:58,830
<25-1,CASTLE>想到盖茨的妹妹
<25-1,CASTLE>You know, I was thinking about Gates' sister,

649
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:00,360
<25-1,CASTLE>我就很好奇
<25-1,CASTLE>and it got me wondering --

650
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:03,290
<25-1,CASTLE>你还有没有什么我不知道的家人
<25-1,CASTLE>do you have any family I don't know about?

651
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:04,770
<25-2,BECKETT>我想没有
<25-2,BECKETT>I don't think so.

652
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:08,520
<25-3,CASTLE>那就好  因为我们这个"私密的婚礼"
<25-3,CASTLE>Good. Because this "intimate wedding" of ours...

653
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,040
<25-4,BECKETT>不是吧  你也有那么多
<25-4,BECKETT>Oh, no. You too?

654
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:12,490
<25-5,CASTLE>-你那边有多糟  -我有一百多个亲友
<25-5,CASTLE>- How bad is yours? - I've got over 100.

655
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,670
<25-7,CASTLE>我比你还多三百个
<25-7,CASTLE>I'm at 300 over that.

656
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:16,660
<25-7,CASTLE>四百个
<25-7,CASTLE>400?!

657
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:19,150
<25-9,CASTLE>公平点来说  毕竟我名震全球...
<25-9,CASTLE>Well, to be fair, I am world-famous...

658
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:20,880
<25-9,CASTLE>...吧
<25-9,CASTLE>...ish.

659
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:22,370
<25-9,CASTLE>听着  这只是初稿
<25-9,CASTLE>Uh, look, it's a first draft.

660
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:23,130
<25-9,CASTLE>再精简一下就行了
<25-9,CASTLE>It just needs some editing.

661
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:25,860
<25-9,CASTLE>残暴无情地精简
<25-9,CASTLE>Brutal, ruthless editing.

662
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:27,730
<25-10,BECKETT>卡塞尔  迈克尔·康纳利
<25-10,BECKETT>Castle, Michael Connelly?

663
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:29,480
<25-10,BECKETT>你都一年多没见过他了
<25-10,BECKETT>You haven't seen him in over a year.

664
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:32,210
<25-10,BECKETT>你不记得他怎么写你上一本书的了吗
<25-10,BECKETT>Do you not remember what he wrote about your last book?

665
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:33,920
<25-10,BECKETT>不行  第一个要精简的就是他
<25-10,BECKETT>No. I think we got our first edit.

666
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,380
<25-11,CASTLE>我必须得邀请康纳利
<25-11,CASTLE>Uh, well, I have to invite Connelly,

667
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:36,670
<25-11,CASTLE>因为万一他发现
<25-11,CASTLE>because if he finds out

668
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:38,650
<25-11,CASTLE>乔纳森·凯勒曼被邀请了...
<25-11,CASTLE>that Jonathan Kellerman made the cut --

670
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:39,580
<25-11,CASTLE>而我必须得邀请凯勒曼
<25-11,CASTLE>And I have to invite Kellerman

671
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:41,730
<25-11,CASTLE>是因为我得邀请韦斯·克雷文和史蒂芬·金
<25-11,CASTLE>because I have to invite Wes Craven and Stephen King.

672
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:42,930
<25-12,BECKETT>那我们总得找个地方下手吧
<25-12,BECKETT>Yeah, but we got to start somewhere.

673
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:45,200
<25-13,CASTLE>我知道从哪下手了
<25-13,CASTLE>Well, I think I know where.

674
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,690
<25-13,CASTLE>特雷莎姑姑

675
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:47,560
<25-13,CASTLE>真的假的
<25-13,CASTLE>Really?

676
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,300
<25-13,CASTLE>她在脸谱网上那么说我
<25-13,CASTLE>After what she posted about me on facebook?

677
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,690
<25-14,BECKETT>她后来删了
<25-14,BECKETT>She took it down.

678
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,700
<25-15,CASTLE>好吧
<25-15,CASTLE>Fine.

679
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:53,360
<25-16,BECKETT>怎么办
<25-16,BECKETT>What are we gonna do?

680
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,070
<25-16,BECKETT>我们不能请五百个人来参加婚礼
<25-16,BECKETT>We can't have 500 people at the wedding.

00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:30,120
<26-2,BECKETT>所以人数从585降到582了吗
<26-2,BECKETT>That takes us from, what, 585 to 582?

696
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,030
<26-2,BECKETT>一定有更好的精简办法
<26-2,BECKETT>There's got to be a better way to cut this down.

697
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:33,920
<26-2,BECKETT>瑞恩  你的婚礼规模就挺小
<26-2,BECKETT>Ryan, you guys kept your wedding small.

698
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,290
<26-2,BECKETT>大概就一百人吧
<26-2,BECKETT>What was it -- like 100 people?

699
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,270
<26-3,RYAN>对  我们只花得起这个钱
<26-3,RYAN>Yeah, that's all we could afford.

700
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:39,750
<26-4,CASTLE>你是怎么精简名单的
<26-4,CASTLE>How did you contain the list?

701
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,620
<26-5,RYAN>有很多亲戚都记恨上我了
<26-5,RYAN>I have a lot of relatives who hate me now.

702
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,050
<26-6,RYAN>科尔德罗电话的搜查令下来了
<26-6,RYAN>So, the warrant on Cordero's phone finally came through.

703
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:48,710
<26-6,RYAN>不管这个阿曼多·加西亚是谁
<26-6,RYAN>Whoever this Armando Garcia is,

704
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:50,030
<26-6,RYAN>一定跟委内瑞拉有关
<26-6,RYAN>it has something to do with Venezuela.

705
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:51,660
<26-7,BECKETT>彼得就是从那来的
<26-7,BECKETT>That's where Peter was from.

706
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,560
<26-8,ESPOSITO>第一个确认那两千五百万的电话
<26-8,ESPOSITO>Yeah, that first call confirming the $25 million?

707
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,180
<26-8,ESPOSITO>是打给一家委内瑞拉银行的
<26-8,ESPOSITO>It was made to a bank in Venezuela.

708
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:57,260
<26-9,RYAN>第二个电话是打给委内瑞拉领事馆的
<26-9,RYAN>The second call was to the Venezuela Consulate

709
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:57,910
<26-9,RYAN>就在市里
<26-9,RYAN>right here in the city.

710
00:28:57,910 --> 00:28:59,710
<26-9,RYAN>是那里一个高级官员的直拨电话
<26-9,RYAN>It was the direct line of a senior official there --

711
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:01,590
<26-9,RYAN>叫路易·德加多
<26-9,RYAN>a Luis Delgado.

712
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,610
<27-1,BECKETT>秘密电汇
<27-1,BECKETT>Clandestine wire transfers,

713
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:08,160
<27-1,BECKETT>高级领事馆官员
<27-1,BECKETT>a high-ranking consulate official,

714
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:12,070
<27-1,BECKETT>都和这个神秘的阿曼多·加西亚有关
<27-1,BECKETT>all circling around the mysterious Armando Garcia.

715
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,770
<27-1,BECKETT>科尔德罗到底在干什么
<27-1,BECKETT>What was Cordero doing?

716
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:16,050
<27-2,CASTLE>我不知道  不过迫不及待想去查出真相了
<27-2,CASTLE>I don't know, but I can't wait to find out.

717
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:18,740
<27-2,CASTLE>瑞士银行户口  秘密汇款
<27-2,CASTLE>Swiss bank accounts, secret money transfers --

718
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:21,970
<27-2,CASTLE>全都笼罩着一种国际化阴谋的气息
<27-2,CASTLE>It's got international intrigue written all over it.

719
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,570
<28-1,VENEZUELAN DIPLOMAT>就是简单的护照申请
<28-1,VENEZUELAN DIPLOMAT>It was just a simple passport request.

720
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:26,770
<28-2,CASTLE>护照申请
<28-2,CASTLE>A passport request?

721
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:28,740
<28-3,VENEZUELAN DIPLOMAT>对  他就是为了这事打来的
<28-3,VENEZUELAN DIPLOMAT>Yes, that's why he called.

722
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:30,350
<28-4,BECKETT>那钱呢
<28-4,BECKETT>Well, what about the money?

723
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,730
<28-5,VENEZUELAN DIPLOMAT>恐怕我不知道什么钱的事
<28-5,VENEZUELAN DIPLOMAT>I'm afraid I don't know anything about any money.

724
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,770
<28-6,CASTLE>真的吗
<28-6,CASTLE>Really?

725
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:37,440
<28-6,CASTLE>那我想你也从没听说过阿曼多·加西亚吧
<28-6,CASTLE>I suppose you've never heard of Armando Garcia, either?

726
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,600
<28-7,VENEZUELAN DIPLOMAT>阿曼多·加西亚
<28-7,VENEZUELAN DIPLOMAT>Armando Garcia?

727
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:41,390
<28-7,VENEZUELAN DIPLOMAT>不  我当然听说过阿曼多·加西亚
<28-7,VENEZUELAN DIPLOMAT>Yes, of course I heard of Armando Garcia.

728
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,450
<28-8,CASTLE>你听说过
<28-8,CASTLE>You have?

729
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,980
<28-10,VENEZUELAN DIPLOMAT>护照就是给他办的
<28-10,VENEZUELAN DIPLOMAT>That's who I got the passport for.

730
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:48,120
<28-11,BECKETT>等等  我以为是给彼得·科尔德罗办的
<28-11,BECKETT>Wait, I thought that the passport was for Peter Cordero.

731
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,290
<28-12,VENEZUELAN DIPLOMAT>是啊  彼得·科尔德罗  阿曼多·加西亚
<28-12,VENEZUELAN DIPLOMAT>Yes, Peter Cordero, Armando Garcia...

732
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,130
<28-12,VENEZUELAN DIPLOMAT>这是同一个人
<28-12,VENEZUELAN DIPLOMAT>...it's the same guy.

733
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:57,570
<28-12,VENEZUELAN DIPLOMAT>他姑姑和姑父搬来纽约的时候
<28-12,VENEZUELAN DIPLOMAT>When his aunt and uncle moved into New York,

734
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,630
<28-12,VENEZUELAN DIPLOMAT>他为了融入环境改名了
<28-12,VENEZUELAN DIPLOMAT>he changed his name to fit in.

735
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:03,560
<28-12,VENEZUELAN DIPLOMAT>他的本名叫阿曼多·加西亚
<28-12,VENEZUELAN DIPLOMAT>But his birth name was Armando Garcia.

736
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,910
<28-13,BECKETT>他是在给自己汇钱
<28-13,BECKETT>He was sending the money to himself.

737
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:10,380
<28-14,CASTLE>你说他要申请护照
<28-14,CASTLE>You said he was requesting a passport.

738
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:12,170
<28-14,CASTLE>委内瑞拉护照吗
<28-14,CASTLE>A Venezuelan passport?

739
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:13,240
<28-14,CASTLE>当然
<28-14,CASTLE>Yes, of course.

740
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:16,980
<28-15,VENEZUELAN DIPLOMAT>科尔德罗要重新申请委内瑞拉国籍
<28-15,VENEZUELAN DIPLOMAT>Cordero applied to re-establish his venezuelan citizenship,

741
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:19,790
<28-15,VENEZUELAN DIPLOMAT>我们很乐意帮忙
<28-15,VENEZUELAN DIPLOMAT>and we were more than happy to oblige.

742
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:21,490
<28-16,CASTLE>以阿曼多·加西亚的名义
<28-16,CASTLE>Under the name "Armando Garcia"?

743
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:23,540
<28-17,VENEZUELAN DIPLOMAT>没错  不过
<28-17,VENEZUELAN DIPLOMAT>That's right. But, uh...

744
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:26,910
<28-17,VENEZUELAN DIPLOMAT>他的申请上有一点很奇怪
<28-17,VENEZUELAN DIPLOMAT>there was something odd about his request.

745
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:29,730
<28-17,VENEZUELAN DIPLOMAT>他想在墨西哥城拿护照
<28-17,VENEZUELAN DIPLOMAT>He asked to pick up the passport in Mexico City.

746
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:32,230
<28-18,BECKETT>墨西哥城  他说了为什么吗
<28-18,BECKETT>Mexico City? Did he say why?

747
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,910
<28-19,VENEZUELAN DIPLOMAT>没有  不过他昨天就该去那边的大使馆拿的
<28-19,VENEZUELAN DIPLOMAT>No, but he was supposed to get it yesterday at our embassy there.

748
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:37,790
<28-19,VENEZUELAN DIPLOMAT>他订了机票
<28-19,VENEZUELAN DIPLOMAT>He had booked a flight

749
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,480
<28-19,VENEZUELAN DIPLOMAT>从墨西哥城飞加拉加斯[委内瑞拉首都]
<28-19,VENEZUELAN DIPLOMAT>from Mexico City to Caracas that night.

750
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,540
<29-1,GATES>他想跑
<29-1,GATES>He was running away?

751
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,270
<29-2,BECKETT>不只是跑
<29-2,BECKETT>Not just running away,

752
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,630
<29-2,BECKETT>还有彻底改变他的身份
<29-2,BECKETT>changing his identity completely.

753
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:48,480
<29-3,GATES>他从未打算来作证
<29-3,GATES>He never intended to testify.

754
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,150
<29-3,GATES>他只是在欺骗我妹妹
<29-3,GATES>He was just stringing my sister along

755
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:51,380
<29-3,GATES>直到他能逃走
<29-3,GATES>until he could escape.

756
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:53,130
<29-4,CASTLE>他只需要开车去墨西哥
<29-4,CASTLE>All he had to do was drive to Mexico.

757
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:54,910
<29-4,CASTLE>一旦他登上去加拉加斯[委内瑞拉首都]的飞机
<29-4,CASTLE>Once he boarded that flight to Caracas

758
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:57,610
<29-4,CASTLE>在他用新的信用卡买的新的身份之下生活
<29-4,CASTLE>under his new identity, paid for with a new credit card,

759
00:30:57,610 --> 00:30:59,230
<29-4,CASTLE>彼得·科尔德罗就会从此消失了
<29-4,CASTLE>Peter Cordero would cease to exist.

760
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:00,570
<29-4,CASTLE>你妹妹永远都找不到他
<29-4,CASTLE>Your sister would never find him.

761
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:02,760
<29-5,BECKETT>但他并不想空手离去
<29-5,BECKETT>But he wasn't gonna leave empty-handed,

762
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,710
<29-5,BECKETT>所以他铤而走险地做了最后一笔交易
<29-5,BECKETT>so he made one last desperate deal.

763
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:06,030
<29-6,CASTLE>他被杀的那晚
<29-6,CASTLE>The night he was killed,

764
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,680
<29-6,CASTLE>他准备着带着两千五百万
<29-6,CASTLE>he was preparing to disappear forever

765
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,210
<29-6,CASTLE>就此消失
<29-6,CASTLE>along with the $25 million.

766
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:12,000
<29-7,GATES>不可能就这么凭空变出来两千五百万
<29-7,GATES>You don't just conjure $25 million out of thin air.

767
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,250
<29-7,GATES>肯定是有来源的
<29-7,GATES>It came from somewhere.

768
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:15,200
<29-8,CASTLE>而且鉴于这种情况  肯定还是非法的
<29-8,CASTLE>And, given the circumstances, nowhere legal.

769
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,680
<29-9,GATES>如果你是对的  这会毁掉我妹妹的案子
<29-9,GATES>If you're right, it'll destroy my sister's case.

770
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,690
<29-9,GATES>他做的所有证词会被作废
<29-9,GATES>All his testimony will be tainted.

771
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:21,860
<29-10,BECKETT>长官  你想让我们怎么做
<29-10,BECKETT>Sir, what do you want us to do?

772
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:24,170
<29-11,GATES>查明真相
<29-11,GATES>Find the truth.

773
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,590
<29-12,CASTLE>要想查明真相  我们需要知道
<29-12,CASTLE>In order to do that, we need to know

774
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:29,250
<29-12,CASTLE>这笔钱的来源  但是这根本没办法查出
<29-12,CASTLE>where the money came from, and there's no way to find out.

775
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:30,510
<29-13,RYAN>或许还是可以查出的
<29-13,RYAN>Uh, maybe there is.

776
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:33,330
<29-13,RYAN>阿曼多·加西亚的那个秘密的信用卡
<29-13,RYAN>You know that secret Armando Garcia credit card?

777
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:35,360
<29-13,RYAN>他用来买机票的那张
<29-13,RYAN>You know, the one he used to buy the plane ticket?

778
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,880
<29-13,RYAN>我们在那上面找到了另外一笔交易
<29-13,RYAN>We found another charge on it

779
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,530
<29-13,RYAN>他在一处网吧里租了一台电脑
<29-13,RYAN>for a computer station he rented at an internet cafe.

780
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,750
<29-14,ESPOSITO>他在那里的时间点
<29-14,ESPOSITO>He was there the exact same time

781
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:44,410
<29-14,ESPOSITO>和两千五百万在他账户出现的时间点相吻合
<29-14,ESPOSITO>that $25 million showed up in his account.

782
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:46,820
<29-15,BECKETT>不管他在那做了什么  都跟转账脱不了干系
<29-15,BECKETT>So whatever he was doing there was related to the transfer.

783
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,250
<29-15,BECKETT>网吧里有监控录像
<29-15,BECKETT>That cafe has security video.

784
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:49,860
<29-16,RYAN>如果我们能看到电脑屏幕
<29-16,RYAN>If we can get a look at the computer screen

785
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,170
<29-16,RYAN>或者是彼得在键盘上打了什么
<29-16,RYAN>or Peter's fingers on the keyboard,

786
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:53,530
<29-16,RYAN>或许我们能弄清楚那笔钱的来源
<29-16,RYAN>Maybe we can figure out where that money came from.

787
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:55,060
<29-17,GATES>和他的死因
<29-17,GATES>And why he was killed.

788
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:08,400
<30-1,BECKETT>你还好吗
<30-1,BECKETT>Sir, uh...you okay?

789
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,220
<30-2,GATES>只是在想如何在她不怪我的前提下
<30-2,GATES>Oh, just trying to figure out how to tell my sister

790
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:14,300
<30-2,GATES>告诉我妹妹她的案子完蛋了
<30-2,GATES>her case is compromised without her blaming me.

791
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:17,210
<30-3,BECKETT>你只是在做好你的本职工作  她为什么要怪你呢
<30-3,BECKETT>Why would she blame you when you're just doing you job?

792
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:19,740
<30-4,GATES>我们之间有段往事
<30-4,GATES>There's a history.

793
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,730
<30-5,BECKETT>1998年
<30-5,BECKETT>1998.

794
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:27,370
<30-6,GATES>我刚刚成为内部事务处的主管
<30-6,GATES>I had just been made head of internal affairs.

795
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:29,620
<30-6,GATES>伊丽莎白在地方检察官办公室里任职
<30-6,GATES>Elizabeth was in the D.A.'s office.

796
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:32,700
<30-6,GATES>我们自称"无敌姐妹花"
<30-6,GATES>We called ourselves "The Dynamic Duo."

797
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:35,680
<30-6,GATES>在那时候  伊丽莎白快要
<30-6,GATES>At the time, Elizabeth was closing in

798
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:38,700
<30-6,GATES>扳倒一个在东纽约的海洛因走私团体
<30-6,GATES>on a heroin ring in east New York,

799
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,700
<30-6,GATES>他们安插了卧底
<30-6,GATES>And they had an undercover inside.

800
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,810
<30-6,GATES>他的证词是案件的关键
<30-6,GATES>His testimony was key to the case, but...

801
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,020
<30-7,BECKETT>他并不清白
<30-7,BECKETT>He was dirty?

802
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:48,600
<30-8,GATES>他在伊丽莎白立案的几次查缴中
<30-8,GATES>He skimmed a few eight balls off the very bust

803
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,120
<30-8,GATES>中饱私囊
<30-8,GATES>Elizabeth was building her case around.

804
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:53,480
<30-8,GATES>当我们处抓到他倒卖时
<30-8,GATES>And when my office caught him re-selling it,

805
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:56,950
<30-8,GATES>她来找我  求我不要控诉
<30-8,GATES>She came to me, begged me not to file charges,

806
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:59,770
<30-8,GATES>让我顾全大局
<30-8,GATES>asked me to think of the greater good.

807
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:04,890
<30-8,GATES>我那天也尽职了
<30-8,GATES>I did my job that day, too.

808
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:11,130
<30-9,GATES>从此之后我们的关系再也没回到从前
<30-9,GATES>Hasn't been the same between us since.

809
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:16,160
<30-10,ESPOSITO>监控录像传过来的
<30-10,ESPOSITO>Security video is in.

810
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:20,670
<31-1,RYAN>科尔德罗在那里
<31-1,RYAN>There's Cordero.

811
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:22,260
<31-2,CASTLE>但是角度正好在监控器对面
<31-2,CASTLE>But the angle is over the monitor.

812
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,470
<31-2,CASTLE>我们看不见电脑屏幕
<31-2,CASTLE>We can't see the screen.

813
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:24,610
<31-3,BECKETT>或者是键盘
<31-3,BECKETT>Or the keyboard.

814
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:26,560
<31-3,BECKETT>这根本不可能看出来他在干什么
<31-3,BECKETT>There's no way to tell what he's doing.

815
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:29,430
<31-4,GATES>等一下  等等  他是谁
<31-4,GATES>Wait a minute. Wait. Who is that?

816
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:33,180
<31-5,CASTLE>看看时间代码
<31-5,CASTLE>Take a look at the time code.

817
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,510
<31-5,CASTLE>跟两千五百万出现在
<31-5,CASTLE>It's right around the moment

818
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:38,760
<31-5,CASTLE>科尔德罗瑞士银行账户上的时间点相差无几
<31-5,CASTLE>the $25 million got into Cordero's swiss bank account.

819
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:42,480
<31-6,BECKETT>就是他  是他把钱转给科尔德罗的
<31-6,BECKETT>It's him. He transferred the money to Cordero.

820
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,380
<31-7,GATES>从一个难以追踪的IP地址并由一个
<31-7,GATES>A covert transfer from an untraceable I.P. address,

821
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:46,800
<31-7,GATES>使用化名的人支付的秘密转账
<31-7,GATES>paid for under an alias.

822
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,430
<31-7,GATES>他为了掩盖身份
<31-7,GATES>These people took extraordinary measures

823
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:50,240
<31-7,GATES>真是无所不用其极
<31-7,GATES>to keep from being discovered.

824
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,120
<31-8,BECKETT>放大
<31-8,BECKETT>Zoom in.

825
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:53,810
<31-8,BECKETT>暂停
<31-8,BECKETT>Freeze it.

826
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:57,500
<31-8,BECKETT>等等  这是科尔德罗的上司杰米·波曼
<31-8,BECKETT>Wait. That's Cordero's boss. That Jamie Berman.

827
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:00,620
<31-9,ESPOSITO>为什么波曼秘密转给科尔德罗两千五百万
<31-9,ESPOSITO>Why would Berman secretly pay Cordero $25 million?

828
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,000
<31-10,BECKETT>只有一个原因
<31-10,BECKETT>Only one reason.

829
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:02,930
<31-10,BECKETT>科尔德罗一定告诉了波曼
<31-10,BECKETT>Cordero must have told Berman

830
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:05,140
<31-10,BECKETT>关于美国检察官的调查
<31-10,BECKETT>about the U.S. Attorney's investigation.

831
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:07,820
<31-11,CASTLE>波曼用钱收买他撤案
<31-11,CASTLE>And Berman was paying him to throw the case.

832
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:15,910
<31-11,CASTLE>如果波曼用钱收买了科尔德罗去撤案
<31-11,CASTLE>If Berman was paying Cordero to throw the case,

833
00:34:15,910 --> 00:34:18,600
<32-1,BECKETT>那他窃听器上的录音就全是假的
<32-1,BECKETT>then the recordings from his wire were all lies.

834
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,080
<32-1,BECKETT>波曼在给美国检察官
<32-1,BECKETT>Berman was feeding

835
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,200
<32-1,BECKETT>虚假的证据
<32-1,BECKETT>the U.S. Attorney's office false evidence.

836
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,720
<32-2,GATES>如果伊丽莎白是以此为据来打官司的话
<32-2,GATES>And if Elizabeth was building her case on that,

837
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,790
<32-2,GATES>她会被辩护方杀的片甲不留
<32-2,GATES>She would have been torn apart by the defense.

838
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,650
<32-3,CASTLE>即便不能永远阻止她调查
<32-3,CASTLE>Keeping her out of Berman's business

839
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:30,880
<32-3,CASTLE>也至少可以让波曼消停一阵子
<32-3,CASTLE>for quite a while, if not forever.

840
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:33,080
<32-4,GATES>一直以来  我妹妹以为她要将波曼拿下了
<32-4,GATES>All this time, my sister thought she was taking down Berman

841
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,430
<32-4,GATES>事实上是他努力把她拿下
<32-4,GATES>when he was really trying to take down her.

842
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:36,830
<32-5,BECKETT>但只有一件事解释不通
<32-5,BECKETT>The one thing it doesn't explain, though,

843
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:39,180
<32-5,BECKETT>为什么科尔德罗被杀
<32-5,BECKETT>is why Cordero was killed.

844
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,270
<32-6,GATES>波曼肯定脱不了干系
<32-6,GATES>Berman's up to his eyeballs in this.

845
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:43,120
<32-6,GATES>你把他带进局里  查出他都知道些什么
<32-6,GATES>You bring him in here and find out what he knows.

846
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,130
<32-7,BECKETT>是的  长官
<32-7,BECKETT>Yes, sir.

847
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:49,490
<33-1,BURMAN>恐怕你犯了个错误  探长
<33-1,BURMAN>I'm afraid you're mistaken, Detective.

848
00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:52,260
<33-1,BURMAN>我没有给科尔德罗先生转过钱
<33-1,BURMAN>I didn't transfer any money to Mr. Cordero,

849
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:55,630
<33-1,BURMAN>更不会转了两千五百万
<33-1,BURMAN>Certainly not $25 million.

850
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,270
<33-2,BECKETT>然而你按下那个按钮的一瞬间
<33-2,BECKETT>And yet, the moment that you press that button,

851
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:59,880
<33-2,BECKETT>两千五百万出现在了科尔德罗的账户上
<33-2,BECKETT>$25 million showed up in Cordero's account.

852
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:02,990
<33-3,LAWYER>你没有任何证据证明那个账户是属于科尔德罗先生的
<33-3,LAWYER>You have no evidence that account belongs to Mr. Cordero,

853
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:05,890
<33-3,LAWYER>就像你没有任何证据证明是我客户汇的款
<33-3,LAWYER>Just as you have no evidence that money came from my client.

854
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:08,560
<33-4,CASTLE>那你为什么和他一块在网吧里
<33-4,CASTLE>Then why were you with him in that internet cafe?

855
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,890
<33-5,BURMAN>那里的咖啡不错
<33-5,BURMAN>They have good coffee.

856
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:12,510
<33-6,BECKETT>我认为你不怕麻烦想让转账
<33-6,BECKETT>I think there's a reason why you went out of you way

857
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:13,990
<33-6,BECKETT>成为一个秘密是有原因的
<33-6,BECKETT>to keep that transfer a secret.

858
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:16,090
<33-6,BECKETT>我认为科尔德罗告诉你他被迫
<33-6,BECKETT>I think Cordero told you that he was being forced

859
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:18,380
<33-6,BECKETT>成了美国检察官的线人
<33-6,BECKETT>to be an informant for the U.S. Attorney.

860
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:20,830
<33-6,BECKETT>他知道自己永远都不可能复职了
<33-6,BECKETT>And knowing that he would never be able to work again,

861
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:22,260
<33-6,BECKETT>他和你做了一笔交易
<33-6,BECKETT>He struck a deal with you.

862
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:26,170
<33-6,BECKETT>用两千五百万来换你提供虚假证据
<33-6,BECKETT>$25 million in exchange for providing false evidence

863
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:28,040
<33-6,BECKETT>从而破坏调查
<33-6,BECKETT>to undermine the investigation.

864
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,730
<33-7,BURMAN>什么调查
<33-7,BURMAN>What investigation?

865
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:31,270
<33-7,BURMAN>你很清楚是什么调查
<33-7,BURMAN>You know exactly what investigation.

866
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:33,510
<33-8,BECKETT>当你发现他完成不了他的任务
<33-8,BECKETT>And when you found out that he wasn't gonna finish the job --

867
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:35,520
<33-8,BECKETT>他要带着你给他的钱远走高飞
<33-8,BECKETT>That he was gonna leave town and take your money with him --

868
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,780
<33-8,BECKETT>你杀了他
<33-8,BECKETT>You had him killed.

869
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,320
<33-8,BECKETT>然后你把他戴在身上的窃听器拿走
<33-8,BECKETT>And then you took the wire that you knew he was wearing

870
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:42,150
<33-8,BECKETT>来掩盖你谋杀的一切记录证据
<33-8,BECKETT>to cover up any recorded evidence of the murder.

871
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:44,140
<33-9,LAWYER>这都是胡乱猜测
<33-9,LAWYER>That's all wild speculation.

872
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:47,580
<33-10,BURMAN>更何况你连事实都搞不清楚
<33-10,BURMAN>Not to mention, you have your facts wrong.

873
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:53,320
<33-10,BURMAN>你说彼得被杀时身上戴着窃听器
<33-10,BURMAN>You said Peter was wearing his wire when he was killed.

874
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,510
<33-10,BURMAN>恐怕那不可能
<33-10,BURMAN>I'm afraid that's not possible.

875
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:57,960
<33-11,CASTLE>你知道窃听器的事
<33-11,CASTLE>So you knew about the wire?

876
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,400
<33-11,CASTLE>你承认你跟他一块参与了这事
<33-11,CASTLE>You admit you were in on it with him.

877
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,340
<33-12,LAWYER>杰米
<33-12,LAWYER>Jamie.

878
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,480
<33-13,BURMAN>知道这个又不犯法
<33-13,BURMAN>It's not illegal to know.

879
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,630
<33-13,BURMAN>而且我向你保证
<33-13,BURMAN>And I guarantee you

880
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:05,690
<33-13,BURMAN>你永远都不可能把我和转账联系起来
<33-13,BURMAN>you will never link me to that payment,

881
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:07,970
<33-13,BURMAN>这样你永远都不可能证明干扰证人
<33-13,BURMAN>So you'll never be able to prove witness tampering.

882
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:10,080
<33-13,BURMAN>但是没错  我知道窃听器的事
<33-13,BURMAN>But, yeah, I knew about the wire.

883
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,740
<33-13,BURMAN>彼得被杀时身上没戴窃听器
<33-13,BURMAN>And Peter wasn't wearing it when he was killed

884
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,940
<33-13,BURMAN>因为他已经把窃听器放在
<33-13,BURMAN>because he had already left it for the feds

885
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:17,430
<33-13,BURMAN>拉斐特街和斯普林大道交界处的秘密传递点了
<33-13,BURMAN>at the dead drop at Lafayette and Spring.

886
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,660
<33-14,BECKETT>你怎么会
<33-14,BECKETT>How do you even --

887
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,440
<33-14,BECKETT>是在你们俩一块散步的时候
<33-14,BECKETT>The walk that you took together.

888
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,670
<33-14,BECKETT>你和他在一起
<33-14,BECKETT>You were with him.

889
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:28,100
<33-15,BURMAN>我看着他打开其中一个信箱门
<33-15,BURMAN>I saw him go into the mailbox door

890
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:31,040
<33-15,BURMAN>然后把窃听器放到了其中一个盒子里
<33-15,BURMAN>and put it into one of those boxes.

891
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:36,500
<34-1,GATES>谢谢你们能来
<34-1,GATES>Thank you for coming.

892
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:37,500
<34-2,WESTON>应该的
<34-2,WESTON>Of course.

893
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,430
<34-3,GOLDMARK>案件有突破了
<34-3,GOLDMARK>There's been a break in the case?

894
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:41,000
<34-3,GOLDMARK>是的  的确
<34-3,GOLDMARK>Yes, actually.

895
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,380
<34-4,BECKETT>关于彼得·科尔德罗被谋杀一案
<34-4,BECKETT>New information has surfaced

896
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:44,290
<34-4,BECKETT>有新的线索浮出水面了
<34-4,BECKETT>about Peter Cordero's murder.

897
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,240
<34-5,GATES>事实上  美国检察官办公室的某人
<34-5,GATES>In fact, it seems someone in the U.S. Attorney's Office

898
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,950
<34-5,GATES>对科尔德罗在被害当晚没有将窃听器
<34-5,GATES>lied about Cordero not leaving his wire

899
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:52,740
<34-5,GATES>放在传递点这件事撒了谎
<34-5,GATES>at the dead drop the night of his death.

900
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:53,750
<34-6,GOLDMARK>没有人撒谎
<34-6,GOLDMARK>No one lied.

901
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:56,100
<34-6,GOLDMARK>我亲自去情报传递点看过  窃听器不在
<34-6,GOLDMARK>I went to the drop myself. It wasn't there.

902
00:36:57,950 --> 00:36:58,940
<34-7,GATES>伊丽莎白
<34-7,GATES>Elizabeth?

903
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:02,840
<34-8,GATES>你来告诉她吧
<34-8,GATES>Tell her.

904
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:06,850
<34-9,WESTON>史黛芬妮  如果彼得没有把他的窃听器上交的话
<34-9,WESTON>Stefanie, if Peter never turned in his wire,

905
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,580
<34-9,WESTON>那天的录音又怎么会出现在你的电脑上呢
<34-9,WESTON>how did that day's recordings end up on your computer?

906
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:13,240
<34-10,CASTLE>虽说你把那些录音删除了
<34-10,CASTLE>See, even though you erased them,

907
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,900
<34-10,CASTLE>但是我们的技术部成功地修复了
<34-10,CASTLE>the tech department here was able to recover...

908
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,490
<34-10,CASTLE>所有东西
<34-10,CASTLE>everything.

909
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:19,800
<34-11,GOLDMARK>我不知道你在说什么
<34-11,GOLDMARK>I don't know what you're talking about.

910
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,180
<34-12,GATES>按照标准程序  你应该在第二天一早
<34-12,GATES>Standard procedure was to turn them over

911
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:23,620
<34-12,GATES>将录音上交  以供分析
<34-12,GATES>for analysis the next morning.

912
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:26,180
<34-12,GATES>但是你那天晚上就先听了录音
<34-12,GATES>But you listened to those tapes that night,

913
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:28,050
<34-12,GATES>而且你还听到了一些本不该听到的东西
<34-12,GATES>and you heard something you weren't supposed to,

914
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:30,510
<34-12,GATES>至少是在科尔德罗消失前不想让你听到的东西
<34-12,GATES>at least not until Cordero was gone.

915
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:35,020
<34-13,PETER>我怀揣着美国梦来到了美国
<34-13,PETER>I came to the U.S. believing in the American dream.

916
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:37,850
<34-13,PETER>于是我在这腐败的世界  给腐败贪心的人打工
<34-13,PETER>So I worked hard and tried to be honest in a corrupt world,

917
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:39,480
<34-13,PETER>并且还能做到艰苦奋斗  刚正不阿
<34-13,PETER>working for corrupt and greedy people,

918
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,320
<34-13,PETER>那是因为我还坚信着美国梦
<34-13,PETER>because I still believed.

919
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:44,500
<34-13,PETER>可是当你  美国政府
<34-13,PETER>But when you, the U.S. government,

920
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:47,580
<34-13,PETER>就为了找个人作证  就嫁祸我藏毒
<34-13,PETER>plants drugs on me, threatens to destroy my future,

921
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:49,740
<34-13,PETER>还威胁说要毁了我的未来
<34-13,PETER>all because you need someone to testify,

922
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:52,900
<34-13,PETER>我还怎么能继续坚信下去
<34-13,PETER>how am I supposed to still believe?

923
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,560
<34-13,PETER>我已经尽我所能地按规矩办事
<34-13,PETER>I did everything I could to play by the rules,

924
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,210
<34-13,PETER>但其他人没有这样做
<34-13,PETER>but no one else does.

925
00:37:57,810 --> 00:38:00,230
<34-13,PETER>所以当你们听到这段录音时  我已经消失了
<34-13,PETER>So by the time you hear this, I'll be gone.

926
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:08,260
<34-14,BECKETT>我们讯问过逮到科尔德罗的那位警官
<34-14,BECKETT>We brought in the cop that busted Cordero.

927
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:12,920
<34-15,CASTLE>他承认是你指使他嫁祸科尔德罗藏毒的
<34-15,CASTLE>He confessed to planting the cocaine... on your orders.

928
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,610
<34-16,WESTON>你为什么要这么做  史黛芬妮
<34-16,WESTON>Why, Stefanie?

929
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,400
<34-17,GOLDMARK>你说过你需要一个内线
<34-17,GOLDMARK>You said you needed someone on the inside,

930
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:23,730
<34-17,GOLDMARK>才能对波曼立案  你说这是为了大局
<34-17,GOLDMARK>to make the case against Berman, for the greater good.

931
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,590
<34-18,WESTON>那也不是这样做呀
<34-18,WESTON>No. Not like this.

932
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:28,770
<34-19,CASTLE>当你听到录音
<34-19,CASTLE>When you heard that recording

933
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:30,500
<34-19,CASTLE>发现彼得要潜逃
<34-19,CASTLE>and found out Peter was leaving,

934
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:32,350
<34-19,CASTLE>你知道这一切都会大白于天下
<34-19,CASTLE>you knew it would all come out.

935
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,530
<34-19,CASTLE>所以你就去了他家
<34-19,CASTLE>So you went to his place.

936
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:36,820
<34-20,GOLDMARK>我是去试图说服他  但他不肯听我解释
<34-20,GOLDMARK>I-I went to try and talk to him, but he wouldn't listen.

937
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,920
<34-21,BECKETT>然后你看到了他的枪
<34-21,BECKETT>And then you saw his gun,

938
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,640
<34-21,BECKETT>就临时起意要永远封住他的嘴
<34-21,BECKETT>and you made sure that his story would never get out.

939
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:43,960
<34-21,BECKETT>接下来你还把现场布置得像是
<34-21,BECKETT>And then you made it look like

940
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,890
<34-21,BECKETT>有人为了夺走窃听录音带而将他杀害
<34-21,BECKETT>he was killed for that recording.

941
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,540
<35-1,WESTON>贝克特警探  卡塞尔先生
<35-1,WESTON>Detective Beckett, Mr. Castle.

942
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:59,230
<35-1,WESTON>我想赞扬你们  在顶着来自我和我办公室的压力下
<35-1,WESTON>I would like to commend you for your exemplary work

943
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:01,820
<35-1,WESTON>还能如此出色地完成任务
<35-1,WESTON>in the face of head winds from me and my office.

944
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:02,670
<35-2,BECKETT>谢谢夸奖
<35-2,BECKETT>Oh, thank you.

945
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:05,110
<35-2,BECKETT>但我们只是在警监的领导下
<35-2,BECKETT>But, I mean, we were just all doing our jobs,

946
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,790
<35-2,BECKETT>做了自己的本职工作而已
<35-2,BECKETT>following our captain's lead.

947
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:10,630
<35-3,CASTLE>你追踪到那两千五百万美金了吗
<35-3,CASTLE>Did you manage to track down that $25 million?

948
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:12,640
<35-4,WESTON>追到了  科尔德罗先生把一大部分
<35-4,WESTON>Yes, it turns out that Mr. Cordero

949
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,600
<35-4,WESTON>都捐献了  用来重建他的家乡
<35-4,WESTON>donated a large portion of it to rebuild his hometown --

950
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,900
<35-4,WESTON>也就是害他父母丧命的地震
<35-4,WESTON>the one that was destroyed

951
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,950
<35-4,WESTON>所摧毁的家乡
<35-4,WESTON>in the earthquake that killed his parents.

952
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:20,750
<35-5,BECKETT>你要试图把那笔钱追回来吗
<35-5,BECKETT>Are you gonna try to recover it?

953
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:22,960
<35-6,WESTON>一旦资金出了国境
<35-6,WESTON>Well, it's very difficult to reclaim funds

954
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,730
<35-6,WESTON>就很难在追讨回来了
<35-6,WESTON>once they've left the country.

955
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:27,930
<35-6,WESTON>还不如用我们的资源去干点别的事呢
<35-6,WESTON>Think that we have better uses for our resources.

956
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,330
<35-6,WESTON>我该走了  再次感谢你们
<35-6,WESTON>I should be going, but thank you again.

957
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,550
<35-7,GATES>那波曼呢  你还能对他立案吗
<35-7,GATES>What about Berman? Do you still have a case?

958
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:38,020
<35-8,WESTON>虽说这跟我预想的结果不同
<35-8,WESTON>Well, not the one that I thought,

959
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:39,850
<35-8,WESTON>但起码我不至于在法庭上
<35-8,WESTON>but at least I won't embarrass myself in court

960
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:41,960
<35-8,WESTON>出示不真实证据令自己难堪了
<35-8,WESTON>presenting evidence that's untrue.

961
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:45,070
<35-9,GATES>看来波曼白白损失了两千五百万美金
<35-9,GATES>Then Berman paid $25 million for nothing.

962
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,120
<35-9,GATES>这滋味肯定不好受呀
<35-9,GATES>Bet that hurt.

963
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,250
<35-10,WESTON>或许吧  但这还不够
<35-10,WESTON>Probably, but it's not enough.

964
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:49,820
<35-10,WESTON>我们会正规地立案
<35-10,WESTON>We will build our case the right way.

965
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:51,740
<35-10,WESTON>也许要花上点时间  但我们会抓到他的
<35-10,WESTON>It may take some time, but we'll get him.

966
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,890
<35-11,GATES>谢谢你  维多利亚
<35-11,GATES>Thank you, Victoria.

967
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:55,850
<35-11,GATES>谢我什么
<35-11,GATES>For what?

968
00:39:56,830 --> 00:39:58,540
<35-12,WESTON>谢谢你如此出色的工作
<35-12,WESTON>For doing your job so well.

969
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,530
<35-13,WESTON>我知道  现在已经不早了
<35-13,WESTON>So, I know it's -- it's late

970
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:03,710
<35-13,WESTON>你也许也想回家了
<35-13,WESTON>and you probably want to get home,

971
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:06,080
<35-13,WESTON>可是今天经历了这么多事  我真的很想和我的姐姐
<35-13,WESTON>but after today, I could really use a drink...

972
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:09,060
<35-13,WESTON>喝上一杯
<35-13,WESTON>...and a sister.

973
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:11,690
<35-14,GATES>我也是
<35-14,GATES>Me too.

974
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:23,810
<36-1,CASTLE>到头来  盖茨的妹妹人也不坏嘛
<36-1,CASTLE>You know, in the end, Gates' sister wasn't that bad.

975
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:25,790
<36-2,BECKETT>这是不是意味着我们要请她来参加婚礼呢
<36-2,BECKETT>Does that mean we have to invite her to the wedding?

976
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,050
<36-3,CASTLE>对了  说起这件事  咱们的名单怎么办
<36-3,CASTLE>Yeah, what about that -- our lists?

977
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:29,950
<36-4,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我们不能请那么多人
<36-4,BECKETT>Castle, we can't have that many people coming.

978
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:31,630
<36-5,CASTLE>同意  那我们该怎么办呢
<36-5,CASTLE>Agreed. So, what do we do?

979
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,810
<36-6,BECKETT>我想我们必须决定
<36-6,BECKETT>I think we have to decide

980
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:35,100
<36-6,BECKETT>咱们到底为什么要办这场婚礼
<36-6,BECKETT>why we're actually having this wedding.

981
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:36,550
<36-6,BECKETT>我们办婚礼到底是为了
<36-6,BECKETT>I mean, are we doing this

982
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:38,240
<36-6,BECKETT>不伤害周围这几百人的感情呢
<36-6,BECKETT>not to insult hundreds of people

983
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,690
<36-6,BECKETT>还是为了咱们自己呢
<36-6,BECKETT>or are we doing this for us?

984
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:41,260
<36-7,CASTLE>当然是为了咱们自己
<36-7,CASTLE>Well, for us.

985
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:43,190
<36-8,BECKETT>那我们何不花上一分钟时间
<36-8,BECKETT>Well, then, why don't we just take a minute

986
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,860
<36-8,BECKETT>写下那些不管怎样都一定必须
<36-8,BECKETT>and write down the names of all the people

987
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:47,910
<36-8,BECKETT>要出席婚礼
<36-8,BECKETT>that absolutely, positively have to be there,

988
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,140
<36-8,BECKETT>就为了让咱俩开心的人的名单呢
<36-8,BECKETT>no matter what, to make us happy?

989
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:51,810
<36-9,CASTLE>就一分钟
<36-9,CASTLE>One minute.

990
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:52,790
<36-10,BECKETT>没错
<36-10,BECKETT>Yeah.

991
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,360
<36-11,CASTLE>时间很短啊  要是我们把某个人给忘了呢
<36-11,CASTLE>That's not much time. What if we forget someone?

992
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:57,620
<36-12,BECKETT>那就说明我们本来就不该请这个人
<36-12,BECKETT>Then they shouldn't have been invited in the first place.

993
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:00,440
<36-13,CASTLE>那就这么办吧
<36-13,CASTLE>Let's do it.

994
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,310
<36-14,BECKETT>好的
<36-14,BECKETT>Okay.

995

998
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,510
<36-17,CASTLE>计时开始
<36-17,CASTLE>And go.

999
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:14,900
<36-18,BECKETT>你停笔了
<36-18,BECKETT>You stopped writing.

<36-19,CASTLE>你也是
<36-19,CASTLE>So did you.

1001

<36-20,CASTLE>我必须要请我妈和阿丽克西
<36-20,CASTLE>I'm going to have to invite my mother and Alexis.
