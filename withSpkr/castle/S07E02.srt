24
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,100
<1-1,COXSWAIN>停住  停住
<1-1,COXSWAIN>Hold water. Hold water.

28
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,300
<1-2,ROWER>什么东西啊
<1-2,ROWER>What is that?

29
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:07,950
<1-2,ROWER>可怕的谋杀  惊悚  刺激
<1-2,ROWER>Gruesome murders, chills and thrills...

31
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,750
<2-1,BROOKE>这就是作家卡塞尔闻名天下的东西
<2-1,BROOKE>It's what author richard Castle is known for,

33
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,130
<2-1,BROOKE>他又发布了两本新书
<2-1,BROOKE>And he's delivered yet again with two new books...

34
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,230
<2-1,BROOKE>《狂野斯道姆》和《狂怒希特》
<2-1,BROOKE>"Wild Storm" and "Raging Heat."

35
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,620
<2-1,BROOKE>谢谢你今早能来
<2-1,BROOKE>Thank you for joining us this morning.

36
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:17,240
<2-2,CASTLE>很荣幸
<2-2,CASTLE>My pleasure.

37
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,880
<2-3,BROOKE>但最大的谜团似乎是围绕着你的那个
<2-3,BROOKE>But perhaps the bigger mystery is the one that surrounds you.

38
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,950
<2-3,BROOKE>你的失踪登上了全国报纸头条
<2-3,BROOKE>Your disappearance made national headlines.

39
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:26,010
<2-3,BROOKE>几个月后  你在海上一艘小艇上被发现
<2-3,BROOKE>Months later, you were found in a dinghy at sea,

40
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:27,230
<2-3,BROOKE>而你却说完全不记得
<2-3,BROOKE>Yet you claim to have no memory

41
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:29,060
<2-3,BROOKE>自己去了哪里  怎么跑到小艇上
<2-3,BROOKE>of where you've been or how you got there.

42
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,940
<2-4,CASTLE>是啊  我知道这听上去很疯狂  我都这么觉得
<2-4,CASTLE>Yeah, I know it, uh... it sounds crazy, even to me,

43
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:34,830
<2-4,CASTLE>我们还在寻找答案
<2-4,CASTLE>and, uh, we're still looking for answers.

44
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,860
<2-5,BROOKE>你的评论家似乎有些看法
<2-5,BROOKE>Well, your critics seem to have some.

45
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,500
<2-5,BROOKE>这并不是秘密了  你上本书《狂野斯道姆》
<2-5,BROOKE>It's no secret your last book, "Wild Storms,"

46
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,150
<2-5,BROOKE>没能登上畅销榜
<2-5,BROOKE>slipped off the best-seller list.

47
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:41,920
<2-5,BROOKE>那么最合理的解释
<2-5,BROOKE>Isn't the most logical explanation

48
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,600
<2-5,BROOKE>难道不是这只是宣传手段吗
<2-5,BROOKE>that this is all a publicity stunt,

49
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,810
<2-5,BROOKE>让你登上头条  给新书促销
<2-5,BROOKE>a way to make headlines to drum up book sales?

50
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,620
<2-6,CASTLE>我保证  布鲁克  这绝非宣传手段
<2-6,CASTLE>I assure you, Brooke, it was no publicity stunt.

51
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:51,990
<2-6,CASTLE>我绝不会这么折磨我的家人和未婚妻
<2-6,CASTLE>I would never do that to my family of my fiance.

52
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:53,640
<2-7,BROOKE>说到你的未婚妻
<2-7,BROOKE>Speaking of your fiance,

53
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,400
<2-7,BROOKE>你正是在婚礼前失踪的
<2-7,BROOKE>you vanished just moments before your wedding.

54
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:59,670
<2-7,BROOKE>你要对认为你的失踪只是怯婚的粉丝说些什么
<2-7,BROOKE>What do you say to fans who chalk your disappearance up to cold feet?

55
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:02,750
<2-8,CASTLE>我要说  他们根本不了解情况
<2-8,CASTLE>Well, I would say that they don't know what they're talking about.

56
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:03,910
<2-9,BROOKE>那么婚礼还会举行吗
<2-9,BROOKE>So the wedding's still on.

57
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:06,230
<2-10,CASTLE>我们经历了一段折磨
<2-10,CASTLE>Well, we've been through a very tough experience.

58
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:08,600
<2-10,CASTLE>我们还在想办法解释一切
<2-10,CASTLE>We're still trying to make sense o-of everything, actually.

59
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,850
<2-10,CASTLE>其实...
<2-10,CASTLE>And I actually just... I-I...

60
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,130
<2-10,CASTLE>我是来谈我的书的
<2-10,CASTLE>I came here to talk about my books.

61
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:15,430
<2-11,BROOKE>如果这是您写的一本书  卡塞尔先生
<2-11,BROOKE>And if this were one of your books, Mr. Castle,

62
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,760
<2-11,BROOKE>你不会觉得这情节有点难以置信吗
<2-11,BROOKE>wouldn't you find the plot a little hard to swallow?

63
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,220
<2-11,BROOKE>失忆症  拜托啊
<2-11,BROOKE>I mean, amnesia, really?

64
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:24,720
<2-12,CASTLE>但这不是小说  布鲁克
<2-12,CASTLE>Well, this isn't a novel, Brooke.

65
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,070
<2-12,CASTLE>这是确有其事
<2-12,CASTLE>This actually happened.

66
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:28,780
<2-12,CASTLE>没有人比我更想知道真相
<2-12,CASTLE>And no one wants the truth more than I do.

67
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,510
<2-12,CASTLE>我可以证明
<2-12,CASTLE>And I can prove it.

68
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:37,030
<3-1,KATE BECKETT>我要悬赏25万美金
<3-1,KATE BECKETT>I'm offering a reward... $250,000...

69
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:39,410
<2-12,CASTLE>奖赏任何能拿出切实证据
<2-12,CASTLE>to anyone who can give me verifiable proof

70
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,650
<2-12,CASTLE>证明我失踪两个月内究竟身在何处
<2-12,CASTLE>as to where I was and exactly what I was doing

71
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,460
<2-12,CASTLE>做了什么的人
<2-12,CASTLE>during the two months I was missing.

72
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,290
<3-1,KATE BECKETT>那就不是采访
<3-1,KATE BECKETT>That wasn't an interview.

73
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,960
<3-1,KATE BECKETT>简直是埋伏
<3-1,KATE BECKETT>That was an ambush.

74
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:49,890
<3-1,KATE BECKETT>你怎么想的啊  居然给出25万元的悬赏
<3-1,KATE BECKETT>And what were you thinking offering a quarter-million-dollar reward?

75
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:50,530
<3-2,CASTLE>很聪明吧
<3-2,CASTLE>Genius, right?

76
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:51,940
<3-2,CASTLE>我真不知自己怎么没早点想到
<3-2,CASTLE>I don't know why I didn't think of it sooner.

77
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:52,860
<3-3,BECKETT>也行因为你知道
<3-3,BECKETT>Well, maybe because you knew

78
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:55,770
<3-3,BECKETT>这只会吸引疯子和投机者
<3-3,BECKETT>it was gonna lure crackpots and opportunists,

79
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,930
<3-3,BECKETT>我们不会跟进真正的线索
<3-3,BECKETT>and instead of going after real leads,

80
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:01,030
<3-3,BECKETT>而是追踪数几千个拿你的悬赏机会当彩票的
<3-3,BECKETT>we're gonna be chasing thousands of half-baked tipsters

81
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,840
<3-3,BECKETT>疯癫线人提供的情报
<3-3,BECKETT>playing the Richard Castle lottery.

82
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,790
<3-4,CASTLE>什么真正的线索
<3-4,CASTLE>What real leads?

83
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:05,290
<3-4,CASTLE>目前为止  我们一直在走死胡同
<3-4,CASTLE>So far, we've had nothing but dead ends.

84
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:06,920
<3-4,CASTLE>我受够蒙在鼓里的感觉了
<3-4,CASTLE>And I'm tired of not knowing.

85
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:08,750
<3-4,CASTLE>要想大海捞针
<3-4,CASTLE>No, to find a needle in a haystack,

86
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,510
<3-4,CASTLE>首先我们需要大海吧
<3-4,CASTLE>do we not first need a haystack?

87
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,090
<3-5,BECKETT>是啊  但不是满是疯子的大海
<3-5,BECKETT>Yeah, but not a haystack full of nutjobs.

88
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,430
<3-6,CASTLE>你也看见访谈了  没人信我
<3-6,CASTLE>You saw that interview. No one believes me.

89
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,620
<3-6,CASTLE>但是外面有人
<3-6,CASTLE>But somewhere out there,

90
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:20,060
<3-6,CASTLE>知道我去过哪里  做了什么
<3-6,CASTLE>someone knows where I was and what I was doing.

91
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,310
<3-7,BECKETT>你准备好了吗
<3-7,BECKETT>You ready for this?

92
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:27,730
<3-8,CASTLE>我或许能解决的谜团吗
<3-8,CASTLE>A mystery I might be able to solve?

93
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,540
<3-8,CASTLE>这会是解脱
<3-8,CASTLE>It'll be a relief.

94
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,890
<3-9,KEVIN RYAN>-卡塞尔  欢迎回来  -谢谢
<3-9,KEVIN RYAN>- Hey, Castle. Welcome back. - Thank you.

95
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:34,390
<3-10,CASTLE>听说东河今天比平常污染更严重一些
<3-10,CASTLE>I hear the East River's a little more polluted than usual today.

96
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:35,680
<3-11,RYAN>是啊  一队船员
<3-11,RYAN>Yeah. A crew team,

97
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,410
<3-11,RYAN>在河里发现了塑料包裹着的尸体
<3-11,RYAN>they found the body in the river wrapped in plastic.

98
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:40,680
<3-11,RYAN>可能是有人扔进河里  想毁尸灭迹
<3-11,RYAN>Someone probably dumped it hoping to make it disappear.

99
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,140
<3-12,BECKETT>他们没有绑足够沉的东西
<3-12,BECKETT>They didn't weigh it down enough.

100
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:44,780
<3-13,RYAN>-死者是谁  -他身上没有身份证
<3-13,RYAN>- So, who's the victim? - Well, he didn't have an I.D. on him,

101
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,220
<3-13,RYAN>但我们将他和一个失踪人口匹配了
<3-13,RYAN>but we matched it to a missing-persons.

102
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:47,910
<3-13,RYAN>华莱士·威利格  45岁
<3-13,RYAN>Wallace Williger, 45,

103
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,580
<3-13,RYAN>威利格玩具公司的业主和总裁
<3-13,RYAN>Owner and C.E.O. of Williger Toys.

104
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,780
<3-14,CASTLE>-制造阳光莎拉的吗  -阳光莎拉是什么
<3-14,CASTLE>- Makers of Sunshine Sarah? - Sunshine Sarah?

105
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,860
<3-16,CASTLE>她是个朝气蓬勃的红发布娃娃
<3-16,CASTLE>She's a spunky, redheaded rag doll.

106
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,510
<3-16,CASTLE>阿莱克西斯小时候最喜欢的娃娃
<3-16,CASTLE>Alexis' favorite when she was growing up.

107
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:57,370
<3-17,BECKETT>-去哪都会带着她  -他什么时候失踪的
<3-17,BECKETT>- Wouldn't go anywhere without her. - When did he go missing?

108
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,950
<3-18,RYAN>上周五  也就是四天以前
<3-18,RYAN>Last Friday, so four days ago.

109
00:03:58,950 --> 00:03:59,970
<3-18,RYAN>他妻子萨曼莎说
<3-18,RYAN>His wife, Samantha, said

110
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:02,040
<3-18,RYAN>他出去看电影了  然后就再也没有回来
<3-18,RYAN>he went off to the movies and never came back.

111
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:08,350
<3-20,CASTLE>-这什么情况  -贝克特没有告诉你吗
<3-20,CASTLE>- Something I should know? - Oh, Beckett didn't tell you?

112
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,750
<3-21,RYAN>你的失踪让他们重归于好了
<3-21,RYAN>Yeah, yeah, your disappearance kind of drove them back together.

113
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,250
<3-21,RYAN>人生苦短什么的
<3-21,RYAN>Life being short and all that.

114
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,900
<3-22,CASTLE>才失踪两个月
<3-22,CASTLE>Oh. Disappear for two months.

115
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:18,320
<4-1,LANIE PARISH>初步检查表明他的脖子断了
<4-1,LANIE PARISH>So, the prelim exam indicates his neck was broken.

116
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,390
<4-2,JAVIER ESPOSITO>鉴于他身上的防御性伤口  可能是因为搏斗
<4-2,JAVIER ESPOSITO>Probably after a struggle given his defensive wound.

117
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:22,610
<4-3,LANIE>幸运的是  尸体掉进水里时是用塑料包裹着的
<4-3,LANIE>Luckily, his body was wrapped when it went into the water.

118
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:25,190
<4-3,LANIE>我也许还可以从死者的手指甲里
<4-3,LANIE>I may still be able to pull the attacker's DNA

119
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:27,080
<4-3,LANIE>提取出凶手的DNA
<4-3,LANIE>From under the victim's nails.

120
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,410
<4-4,BECKETT>等等  他死了多长时间了
<4-4,BECKETT>Wait. How long has he been dead?

121
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:31,110
<4-5,LANIE>至少有几天了
<4-5,LANIE>At least a couple of days.

122
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,800
<4-6,CASTLE>他的脸和手怎么了
<4-6,CASTLE>What happened to his face and hands?

123
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:34,180
<4-6,CASTLE>看起来像是被烧过
<4-6,CASTLE>They look like they've been burned.

124
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,880
<4-7,LANIE>说真的  我不知道
<4-7,LANIE>Honestly, I don't know,

125
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,890
<4-7,LANIE>但尸体的其余部分没有遭到感染
<4-7,LANIE>but the rest of the body wasn't affected.

126
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:40,030
<4-7,LANIE>我带他回实验室后会了解更多情况
<4-7,LANIE>I'll know more when I get him back to the lab.

127
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:46,240
<5-1,SAMANTHA WILLIGER>他没回家时  我感觉很不安心  但是...
<5-1,SAMANTHA WILLIGER>I had that sick feeling when he didn't come home, but...

128
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,170
<5-1,SAMANTHA WILLIGER>人总往好的方面想
<5-1,SAMANTHA WILLIGER>you hope.

129
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,520
<5-2,BECKETT>威利格太太  有谁
<5-2,BECKETT>Mrs. Williger, was there anyone

130
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,500
<5-2,BECKETT>会想伤害你的丈夫吗
<5-2,BECKETT>that would've wanted to do your husband harm?

131
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,170
<5-2,BECKETT>没有
<5-2,BECKETT>No.

132
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:53,810
<5-3,SAMANTHA>他靠制造玩具为生
<5-3,SAMANTHA>He made toys for a living.

133
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,530
<5-3,SAMANTHA>他是个好人
<5-3,SAMANTHA>He was a decent man.

134
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:58,730
<5-4,BECKETT>但是...
<5-4,BECKETT>But...

135
00:04:58,790 --> 00:04:59,640
<5-4,BECKETT>但是什么
<5-4,BECKETT>But what?

136
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,120
<5-5,SAMANTHA>过去几周里  他很难熬
<5-5,SAMANTHA>These last few weeks, he had been having a hard time.

137
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,620
<5-5,SAMANTHA>自从安妮去世后
<5-5,SAMANTHA>Ever since Annie died.

138
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:07,220
<5-6,CASTLE>抱歉  安妮是谁
<5-6,CASTLE>Oh, I'm sorry. Um...who's Annie?

00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,920
<5-7,SAMANTHA>我们的拉布拉多寻回犬
<5-7,SAMANTHA>Our labrador retriever.

140
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,720
<5-7,SAMANTHA>她去世后  沃利开始工作到很晚
<5-7,SAMANTHA>And after she died, Wally started working late,

141
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:14,740
<5-7,SAMANTHA>在我睡觉后才回家  像是在躲着我
<5-7,SAMANTHA>coming home after I was asleep, like he was avoiding me.

142
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,240
<5-8,CASTLE>你跟他谈过这事吗
<5-8,CASTLE>Did you talk to him about it?

143
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,600
<5-9,SAMANTHA>我试过  他说没事
<5-9,SAMANTHA>I tried. He said everything was fine.

144
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,770
<5-9,SAMANTHA>他只是在忙活一个重要项目
<5-9,SAMANTHA>He was just working on an important project.

145
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:23,020
<5-10,BECKETT>他消失的那天呢
<5-10,BECKETT>And what about the day that he disappeared?

146
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,190
<5-10,BECKETT>他说过什么暗示了自己有麻烦的话吗
<5-10,BECKETT>Did he say anything that would indicate he was in trouble?

147
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:26,810
<5-11,SAMANTHA>没有  他很幸福
<5-11,SAMANTHA>No. He was happy.

148
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,400
<5-11,SAMANTHA>他告诉我  他爱我
<5-11,SAMANTHA>He told me he loved me,

149
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:32,330
<5-11,SAMANTHA>说事情很快就会好起来
<5-11,SAMANTHA>said things would be... better soon.

150
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:41,080
<6-1,CASTLE>看到她以后  我简直难以想象你那么多夜晚
<6-1,CASTLE>You know, seeing her, I can't imagine what it was like for you

151
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,660
<6-1,CASTLE>毫不知情时心里的感受
<6-1,CASTLE>all those nights, not knowing.

152
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:46,150
<6-2,BECKETT>我很走运  你回来了
<6-2,BECKETT>I was lucky. You came back.

153
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,610
<6-3,ESPOSITO>我们查看了威利格的手机记录和财务情况
<6-3,ESPOSITO>So, we took a look at Williger's phone and financials.

154
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,930
<6-3,ESPOSITO>他失踪那天没有消费记录
<6-3,ESPOSITO>There was no activity on the day he disappeared.

155
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:52,130
<6-4,RYAN>如果他真是去看电影了
<6-4,RYAN>If he was on his way to the movies,

156
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:54,720
<6-4,RYAN>要么他就没去成  要么就是用现金付的款
<6-4,RYAN>either he didn't make it there or he paid with cash.

157
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,830
<6-5,BECKETT>查查当地的电影院  看有没有人见过他
<6-5,BECKETT>Canvass local theaters, see if anyone saw him.

158
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:59,150
<6-5,BECKETT>再查查他过去几周的记录
<6-5,BECKETT>And take a look at his records for the past couple of weeks,

159
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,950
<6-5,BECKETT>看看有没有什么异常
<6-5,BECKETT>See if there's anything out of the ordinary there.

160
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,440
<6-5,BECKETT>我和卡塞尔去他的办公室
<6-5,BECKETT>Castle and I are gonna go to his office

161
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,000
<6-5,BECKETT>-看看那边有没有什么问题  -马上去
<6-5,BECKETT>- and check if there were any problems at work. - Right on.

162
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:06,480
<6-7,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>卡塞尔先生
<6-7,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>Mr. Castle.

163
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:10,600
<6-8,GATES>你到底以为你在干什么
<6-8,GATES>Just what in the hell do you think you're doing?

164
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,970
<6-9,BECKETT>你把局里的电话号码留给电视台了吗
<6-9,BECKETT>Did you give that TV station the precinct number?

165
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,640
<6-10,CASTLE>我总不能把自家电话给他们啊  那是隐私
<6-10,CASTLE>I'm not gonna give them my home phone. That's private.

166
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,790
<6-11,GATES>纽约警局可不是你的私人助理
<6-11,GATES>The NYPD is not your personal secretary.

167
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:21,420
<6-11,GATES>你知道你的这点小噱头
<6-11,GATES>Did you know how many man-hours

168
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,580
<6-11,GATES>耗费了我们多少人力物力吗
<6-11,GATES>this little stunt of yours is costing us?

169
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,740
<6-11,GATES>电话都快被打爆了
<6-11,GATES>The phones have been ringing off the hook!

170
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,270
<6-12,CASTLE>听到没
<6-12,CASTLE>Did you hear that?!

171
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,630
<6-12,CASTLE>打爆了
<6-12,CASTLE>Ringing off the hook?

172
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,110
<6-13,CASTLE>有线索了
<6-13,CASTLE>We have leads.

173
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,090
<6-14,GATES>什么情况
<6-14,GATES>What just happened?

174
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:42,500
<7-1,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你想什么呢
<7-1,BECKETT>Castle, what were you thinking?

175
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:43,800
<7-2,CASTLE>"不战而屈人之兵
<7-2,CASTLE>"The supreme art of war

176
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,420
<7-2,CASTLE>善之善者也"  孙子说的
<7-2,CASTLE>is to subdue the enemy without fighting," Sun tzu.

177
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:50,070
<7-2,CASTLE>那个战术之吻只是我浩瀚军械库里的一样武器
<7-2,CASTLE>The tactical smooch is just one weapon in my vast arsenal.

178
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:53,380
<7-3,BECKETT>再用一次  敌人可能就要动用核武器了
<7-3,BECKETT>Well, employ it again, and the enemy might go nuclear.

179
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:56,760
<7-4,CASTLE>好吧  总之这叠纸里能找到我之前行踪的线索
<7-4,CASTLE>Okay, but somewhere in this pile is the answer to where I was.

180
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,840
<7-4,CASTLE>我能感觉到
<7-4,CASTLE>I can feel it.

181
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,080
<7-5,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我知道这对我们有多重要
<7-5,BECKETT>Look, castle, I know how important this is to us,

182
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,570
<7-5,BECKETT>但你得知道  这事希望不大
<7-5,BECKETT>But you have to realize, this is a long shot,

183
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:06,580
<7-5,BECKETT>如果没有奏效  我不希望你太失望
<7-5,BECKETT>And I don't want you to be disappointed if it doesn't pan out.

184
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,110
<7-6,CASTLE>有玩具
<7-6,CASTLE>Toys.

185
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,770
<8-1,MARSHA STOLLER>沃利从无到有创建了这里
<8-1,MARSHA STOLLER>Wally built this place from the ground up.

186
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:20,260
<8-1,MARSHA STOLLER>真不敢相信他不在了
<8-1,MARSHA STOLLER>Seems impossible that he's gone.

187
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,860
<8-2,BECKETT>斯托勒小姐  公司一切还好吗
<8-2,BECKETT>Miss Stoller, was everything okay here at work?

188
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:26,350
<8-2,BECKETT>他跟同事或对手起过冲突吗
<8-2,BECKETT>Did he have any conflicts with colleagues or business rivals?

189
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:27,450
<8-3,MARSHA>至少我没听说
<8-3,MARSHA>Not that I'm aware of.

190
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:28,860
<8-3,MARSHA>作为公司的副总裁
<8-3,MARSHA>And as VP of the company,

191
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,260
<8-3,MARSHA>要是有事我肯定会知道
<8-3,MARSHA>I'm sure I'd know.

192
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,910
<8-4,BECKETT>我知道他过去几周承受了不少压力
<8-4,BECKETT>I understand that he was under pressure the past couple of weeks,

193
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,530
<8-4,BECKETT>总是很晚回家
<8-4,BECKETT>that he was coming home late.

194
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,730
<8-5,MARSHA>-谁告诉你的  -他太太
<8-5,MARSHA>- Who told you that? - His wife.

195
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,240
<8-7,MARSHA>不好意思  但这不是真的
<8-7,MARSHA>I'm sorry, but that's not true.

196
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:41,510
<8-7,MARSHA>我是说  他也许的确有压力
<8-7,MARSHA>I mean, he may have been under pressure,

197
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,190
<8-7,MARSHA>但肯定不是因为工作
<8-7,MARSHA>But it certainly wasn't here at work.

198
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,860
<8-8,BECKETT>这么说  他并没有加班到很晚
<8-8,BECKETT>So, he wasn't staying late?

199
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,360
<8-9,MARSHA>没有  正相反
<8-9,MARSHA>No, just the opposite.

200
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,190
<8-9,MARSHA>他每周都有几天会早退
<8-9,MARSHA>He was leaving early several days a week.

201
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,060
<8-10,CASTLE>我没想到这个真能弹
<8-10,CASTLE>I did not realize this would be on.

202
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,630
<8-10,CASTLE>抱歉
<8-10,CASTLE>Sorry.

203
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,440
<8-11,BECKETT>你知道他为什么要早退吗
<8-11,BECKETT>Do you know why he was leaving early?

204
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,600
<8-12,MARSHA>不知道  他说他有些私事要处理
<8-12,MARSHA>No, he said he was taking care of some personal things.

205
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:06,020
<8-12,MARSHA>好像挺私密的  所以我没多问
<8-12,MARSHA>It sounded private, so I didn't ask.

206
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,250
<8-12,MARSHA>不过他可能告诉过他的助理
<8-12,MARSHA>But maybe he told his assistant.

207
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:09,620
<8-12,MARSHA>马特
<8-12,MARSHA>Matt?

208
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,530
<8-13,MARSHA>威利格先生跟你提过
<8-13,MARSHA>Did Mr. Williger ever mention to you

209
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:17,350
<8-13,MARSHA>-他为什么要早退吗  -没有
<8-13,MARSHA>- why he was leaving early? - No.

210
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:20,050
<8-14,MATT MONROE>其实他对这整件事都挺保密的
<8-14,MATT MONROE>He was actually pretty secretive about the whole thing.

211
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:25,590
<8-15,CASTLE>这东西居然就上了膛摆在这儿
<8-15,CASTLE>You leave these loaded?

212
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,300
<9-1,ESPOSITO>我问过被害人的妻子了
<9-1,ESPOSITO>So, I checked with the vic's wife.

213
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,780
<9-1,ESPOSITO>威利格先生声称在加班的那几天
<9-1,ESPOSITO>The days that Mr. Williger claimed he was working late

214
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,690
<9-1,ESPOSITO>正是他在公司早退的日子
<9-1,ESPOSITO>are the exact same days he was leaving work early.

215
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:33,980
<9-2,BECKETT>那就是至少有十多天
<9-2,BECKETT>That leaves about 10 to 12 hours

216
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,450
<9-2,BECKETT>他每天有10-12小时下落不明
<9-2,BECKETT>over at least a dozen days that he's unaccounted for.

217
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:37,630
<9-2,BECKETT>他干什么去了
<9-2,BECKETT>What was he doing?

218
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:39,990
<9-3,RYAN>我刚查了他的电话和财务记录
<9-3,RYAN>I just went back through his phones and financials,

219
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:40,960
<9-3,RYAN>没有问题
<9-3,RYAN>And they are clean.

220
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,880
<9-3,RYAN>说实话  是太过干净了
<9-3,RYAN>In fact, they're too clean.

221
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,170
<9-3,RYAN>那些天从他离开公司
<9-3,RYAN>From the time he left work on those days

222
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:46,390
<9-3,RYAN>到他回家  期间完全没有任何记录
<9-3,RYAN>till the time he got home, there's no activity at all.

223
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:48,170
<9-3,RYAN>没有电话  也没有任何消费
<9-3,RYAN>No calls or purchases of any kind,

224
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:50,010
<9-3,RYAN>连地铁和出租车都没坐过
<9-3,RYAN>Not even subway or cab charges.

225
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:51,540
<9-4,BECKETT>那么  不管他在干什么
<9-4,BECKETT>So, whatever he was doing,

226
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:54,550
<9-4,BECKETT>他不希望任何人知道  为什么
<9-4,BECKETT>He wanted to keep it a secret from everyone. Why?

227
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:57,550
<9-5,RYAN>我们现在正需要卡塞尔的疯狂理论
<9-5,RYAN>What we could use right now is a crazy Castle theory.

228
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,290
<9-6,ESPOSITO>话说回来  卡塞尔哪去了
<9-6,ESPOSITO>Where is Castle, anyway?

229
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:02,920
<9-7,BECKETT>他需要休息  我让他回家查他的线索去了
<9-7,BECKETT>He needed a time out, so I sent him home to check his leads.

230
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,690
<31-5,MAC>嗨  帅哥  嗨  帅哥
<31-5,MAC>Hey, sexy. Hey, sexy.

231
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:08,470
<31-6,WORKER>嗨  帅哥  嗨  帅哥
<31-6,WORKER>Hey, sexy. Hey, sexy.

232
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:10,750
<9-7,BECKETT>肯定是蕾妮改了我的铃声
<9-7,BECKETT>Lanie must have changed my ringtone.

233
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:14,110
<9-8,ESPOSITO>-宝贝  有事吗  -有件奇怪的事
<9-8,ESPOSITO>- Hola, preciosa. What's up? - Something weird.

234
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,560
<9-9,LANIE>你知道被害人脸上和手上的斑点吧
<9-9,LANIE>You know that discoloration on the victim's hands and face?

235
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,360
<9-9,LANIE>是工业清洁剂造成的
<9-9,LANIE>It was caused by an industrial cleaner.

236
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:22,770
<9-9,LANIE>看来有人用这个清洗了他的皮肤
<9-9,LANIE>It looks like someone scrubbed his skin with it

237
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,810
<9-9,LANIE>但是发生在他死后
<9-9,LANIE>but after he was already dead.

238
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:26,980
<9-10,BECKETT>蕾妮  如果凶手是想销毁证据
<9-10,BECKETT>Wait, Lanie, if the killer is trying to get rid of evidence,

239
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:29,270
<9-10,BECKETT>为什么只洗手和脸的部分
<9-10,BECKETT>why would he only scrub the hands and face?

240
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:31,570
<9-11,LANIE>不知道  但清洁剂不含漂白剂
<9-11,LANIE>Don't know, but the cleaner wasn't bleach-based,

241
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:34,680
<9-11,LANIE>所以我还是有可能从指缝提取到DNA
<9-11,LANIE>so I still may be able to pull DNA from under the fingernails.

242
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,540
<9-11,LANIE>我还在他衣服口袋发现了一张收据
<9-11,LANIE>I also found a receipt in the victim's pocket.

243
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,260
<9-11,LANIE>是布鲁克林区的一家咖啡店的
<9-11,LANIE>It's from a coffee shop in Brooklyn,

244
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,340
<9-11,LANIE>日期正是他失踪的那天
<9-11,LANIE>dated the day he disappeared.

245
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:44,160
<9-12,RYAN>威利格住曼哈顿  办公室在市中心
<9-12,RYAN>Williger lived in Manhattan, and his office was in midtown.

246
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,370
<9-12,RYAN>他去布鲁克林干什么
<9-12,RYAN>What was he doing out in Brooklyn?

247
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:46,660
<9-13,BECKETT>你们俩去查查那家咖啡店
<9-13,BECKETT>Why don't you guys canvass the coffee shop

248
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,020
<9-13,BECKETT>看看有没有人见过威利格
<9-13,BECKETT>for anyone that saw Williger?

249
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,010
<9-13,BECKETT>明天一早我就去办
<9-13,BECKETT>I'll get a search warrant for

250
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:50,990
<9-13,BECKETT>他的办公室和住所的搜查令
<9-13,BECKETT>his office and house first thing in the morning.

251
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,380
<10-1,LANIE>好啦  凯特
<10-1,LANIE>Come on, Kate.

252
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,350
<10-1,LANIE>这是他两个月后的第一个案子
<10-1,LANIE>It's his first case back after two months.

253
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:01,310
<10-1,LANIE>你不能指望一切都马上恢复原状
<10-1,LANIE>You didn't expect everything to be back to normal right away.

254
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:03,860
<10-2,BECKETT>不是的  雷恩  只是
<10-2,BECKETT>No, Lane. It's just...

255
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:07,790
<10-2,BECKETT>我希望我们能回到从前
<10-2,BECKETT>It's just I-I want it to be us again,

256
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:10,400
<10-2,BECKETT>但我们之间却横着一道阴影
<10-2,BECKETT>and it's like there's this shadow between us.

257
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:15,300
<10-2,BECKETT>我是选择了信任他
<10-2,BECKETT>Look, I-I am choosing to trust him

258
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,800
<10-2,BECKETT>不论证据看起来如何
<10-2,BECKETT>in spite of all of the evidence.

259
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,370
<10-2,BECKETT>我只是  我希望相信
<10-2,BECKETT>I-I just -- I want to believe --

260
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:21,510
<10-3,LANIE>-但你不知道能不能做到  -是的
<10-3,LANIE>- But you don't know if you can. - Yeah.

261
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:27,070
<10-4,BECKETT>而他  他在假装一切都很好
<10-4,BECKETT>And he's -- he's acting like everything is fine.

262
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,460
<10-4,BECKETT>我们俩都是  但事实并非如此
<10-4,BECKETT>We both are, but it's -- it's not.

263
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:32,680
<10-5,LANIE>也许悬赏是个不错的主意
<10-5,LANIE>Maybe this reward he's offering is a good thing.

264
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,730
<10-5,LANIE>也许能找到真相
<10-5,LANIE>Maybe it'll lead to the truth.

265
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,200
<11-1,ALEXIS CASTLE>不  我不想知道你穿的是什么
<11-1,ALEXIS CASTLE>No, I don't want to know what you're wearing.

266
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,320
<11-1,ALEXIS CASTLE>你到底知不知道理查德·卡塞尔的消息
<11-1,ALEXIS CASTLE>Now, do you have any information about Richard Castle or not?

267
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:43,550
<11-1,ALEXIS CASTLE>谢谢
<11-1,ALEXIS CASTLE>Thanks.

268
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:45,620
<11-2,BECKETT>针捞得怎么样了
<11-2,BECKETT>So, how goes the haystack?

269
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,810
<11-3,CASTLE>显然  你是对的
<11-3,CASTLE>Uh, apparently you were right.

270
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:50,230
<11-4,BECKETT>-都不靠谱吗  -也不全是
<11-4,BECKETT>- Nutjobs? - No. Not all of them.

271
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:52,290
<11-5,ALEXIS>还有一些是期待著名作家
<11-5,ALEXIS>Some are lonely women hoping for a call

272
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,450
<11-5,ALEXIS>理查德·卡塞尔来电的孤独女人
<11-5,ALEXIS>from the famous author Richard Castle.

273
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,900
<11-6,MARTHA RODGERS>应该是我的约会对象
<11-6,MARTHA RODGERS>That will be my date.

274
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,780
<11-7,CASTLE>-你在约会啊  -没错  他叫罗伯特
<11-7,CASTLE>- Ooh. You have a date? - Uh-huh. Robert.

275
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:05,340
<11-8,MARTHA>我们是在悲伤辅导小组认识的  就是你...
<11-8,MARTHA>We met at the grief counseling group when you were presumed...

276
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,680
<11-9,CASTLE>-你约悲伤辅导小组的人  -没错
<11-9,CASTLE>- You -- you picked up a man at grief counseling? - Yes.

277
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,600
<11-10,MARTHA>-如果你能进屋去就更好了  -为什么
<11-10,MARTHA>- Now, I will thank you to go into the other room. - Why?

278
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:12,290
<11-11,CASTLE>因为当时
<11-11,CASTLE>Because at the moment,

279
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:14,380
<11-12,MARTHA>我们交往的基础是失去亲人
<11-12,MARTHA>our relationship is based on mutual loss,

280
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,950
<11-12,MARTHA>要是他发现你活着回来了
<11-12,MARTHA>and if he finds out that you have returned and are alive,

281
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:18,900
<11-12,MARTHA>这会  毁了这份感情的
<11-12,MARTHA>It will just -- it will ruin everything.

282
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,040
<11-13,CASTLE>妈妈  你知道我今早还上电视了吧
<11-13,CASTLE>Mother, you realize I was on television this morning.

283
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,980
<11-14,MARTHA>幸运的是罗伯特很有修养
<11-14,MARTHA>Luckily Robert is a cultured man.

284
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,320
<11-14,MARTHA>他不看电视
<11-14,MARTHA>He does not watch television.

285
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,780
<11-14,MARTHA>而且他只读《华尔街日报》
<11-14,MARTHA>The only newspaper he reads is the Wall Street Journal,

286
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:30,060
<11-14,MARTHA>而且感谢上帝  那上面不会有你的报道
<11-14,MARTHA>which, thankfully, did not carry news of your return.

287
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:31,640
<11-14,MARTHA>所以  进屋去
<11-14,MARTHA>So, go.

288
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,240
<11-14,MARTHA>快快快
<11-14,MARTHA>Go. Go. Go.

289
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:35,480
<12-1,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我相信她的本意是好的
<12-1,BECKETT>Castle, I'm sure she means well.

290
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,640
<12-2,CASTLE>不是这个问题  只是
<12-2,CASTLE>It's not that. It's just, uh...

291
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:40,680
<12-2,CASTLE>我真的以为有人能帮上忙
<12-2,CASTLE>I really thought someone out there could help.

292
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,400
<12-3,BECKETT>我们会解决的  卡塞尔  我们一起
<12-3,BECKETT>We'll figure this out, Castle. Together.

293
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:46,820
<12-4,CASTLE>失陪
<12-4,CASTLE>Excuse me.

294
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:47,640
<12-4,CASTLE>喂
<12-4,CASTLE>Hello?

295
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,420
<12-5,MAN>卡塞尔先生  我知道你在寻找答案
<12-5,MAN>Mr. Castle, I understand you're looking for answers.

296
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,780
<12-6,CASTLE>你是谁  你怎么弄到这个电话的
<12-6,CASTLE>Who is this? How did you get this number?

297
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,440
<12-7,MAN>我知道一些消息
<12-7,MAN>Because I know things,

298
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,060
<12-7,MAN>包括发生在你身上的事
<12-7,MAN>including what happened to you.

299
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,340
<12-7,MAN>你准备好知道真相了吗
<12-7,MAN>Are you ready to hear the truth?

309
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:14,530
<13-1,BECKETT>我觉得这样不好  我应该和你一起去
<13-1,BECKETT>I don't like this. I should go with you.

310
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,010
<13-2,CASTLE>他说了让我一个人来
<13-2,CASTLE>He said I had to come alone.

311
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,880
<13-3,BECKETT>我知道  但是你都不知道对方是谁
<13-3,BECKETT>Yeah, but you don't even know who he is.

312
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,340
<13-4,CASTLE>听起来像个间谍
<13-4,CASTLE>He sounded like a spy.

313
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:22,680
<13-5,BECKETT>你觉得这会不会和你父亲有关
<13-5,BECKETT>Do you think this has something to do with your father?

314
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,990
<13-6,CASTLE>这不是他的风格
<13-6,CASTLE>It doesn't seem like his style.

315
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,160
<13-6,CASTLE>到时间了
<13-6,CASTLE>It's time.

318
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:00,330
<13-7,MAN>跟我走
<13-7,MAN>Walk with me.

319
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,560
<14-1,CASTLE>你是谁
<14-1,CASTLE>Who are you?

320
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:21,020
<14-2,MAN>你知道得越少越好
<14-2,MAN>The less you know, the better.

321
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:23,760
<14-3,CASTLE>可你知道我发生了什么  怎么知道的
<14-3,CASTLE>But you know what happened to me. How?

322
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,140
<14-4,MAN>因为我当时和你在一起
<14-4,MAN>Because I was with you.

323
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,390
<14-4,MAN>它们对你做了那些事  我估计你也记不着了
<14-4,MAN>I don't expect you to remember, not after what they did.

324
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,490
<14-4,MAN>我很幸运逃出来了
<14-4,MAN>I was lucky I escaped.

325
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:34,190
<14-5,CASTLE>从哪逃出来的
<14-5,CASTLE>Escape from where?

326
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,130
<14-6,MAN>船上
<14-6,MAN>The ship.

327
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,970
<14-7,CASTLE>我是在一艘船上
<14-7,CASTLE>I was on a ship.

328
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,200
<14-7,CASTLE>所以我才在海里被发现
<14-7,CASTLE>Which is why I was found at sea.

329
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,500
<14-7,CASTLE>谁的船
<14-7,CASTLE>Whose ship?

330
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:43,990
<14-8,MAN>是一艘勘探船
<14-8,MAN>It's a survey vessel.

331
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,310
<14-8,MAN>至少他们是这么说的
<14-8,MAN>At least that's what they claimed.

332
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:48,390
<14-8,MAN>但我看到船上有武器
<14-8,MAN>But I saw weapons on board.

333
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:51,130
<14-8,MAN>我很确定那是艘攻击舰
<14-8,MAN>Pretty sure it was an attack ship.

334
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:55,960
<14-9,CASTLE>-这么说是军方的  -一定是
<14-9,CASTLE>- So it was military. - Must have been.

335
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:59,420
<14-10,MAN>否则它们为什么要把它藏在
<14-10,MAN>I mean, why else would they keep it

336
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:01,050
<14-10,MAN>月球的背光面
<14-10,MAN>on the dark side of the moon

337
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:04,070
<14-10,MAN>不让我们的科学家看见
<14-10,MAN>where our scientists can't see it?

338
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,160
<14-11,CASTLE>什么
<14-11,CASTLE>Excuse me?

339
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:07,830
<14-12,MAN>他们现在看上去和我们一样了
<14-12,MAN>You know, they look like us now.

340
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:11,680
<14-12,MAN>这就是他们绑走你的原因  为了复制你的皮肤
<14-12,MAN>That's why they took you. To copy your skin.

341
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:16,350
<14-13,CASTLE>你刚才说的船是指  宇宙飞船
<14-13,CASTLE>So, when you say ship, you mean... spaceship?

342
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:19,200
<14-14,MAN>他们入侵的时候我们将无力反抗
<14-14,MAN>We'll be defenseless when the invasion comes.

343
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:22,040
<14-14,MAN>我们必须要找到一个警示世人的办法
<14-14,MAN>We have to find a way to warn people.

344
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,030
<14-14,MAN>你能做到
<14-14,MAN>You can tell people.

345
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:27,770
<14-14,MAN>-你上过电视  -我  我会告诉他们
<14-14,MAN>- You were on TV. - I'll -- I'll warn them. I'll, uh...

346
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:31,200
<14-15,CASTLE>再跟我说一遍你是怎么知道我电话的
<14-15,CASTLE>Tell me again. How did you get my phone number?

347
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,080
<14-16,MAN>-我在电话公司上班  -当然了
<14-16,MAN>- I work for the phone company. - Of course you do.

348
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:41,180
<15-1,BECKETT>怎么了
<15-1,BECKETT>So, what happened?

349
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:43,670
<15-2,CASTLE>我真心不想说
<15-2,CASTLE>I really don't want to talk about it.

350
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,040
<15-2,CASTLE>你能  消停会吗
<15-2,CASTLE>Would you... knock it off?

351
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:54,120
<16-1,ESPOSITO>-来帮我找找  -抱歉
<16-1,ESPOSITO>- Come help me search. - Sorry.

352
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:56,030
<16-2,RYAN>我不知道我父母是怎么做到的
<16-2,RYAN>I don't know how my parents did it.

353
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,250
<16-3,ESPOSITO>做什么
<16-3,ESPOSITO>Did what?

354
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,000
<16-4,RYAN>养育我和我的姐姐们  赚钱养家
<16-4,RYAN>Raise me, all my sisters, put food on the table,

355
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,960
<16-4,RYAN>还能供我学钢琴
<16-4,RYAN>and still manage to give me piano lessons.

356
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,270
<16-4,RYAN>孩子的花销很大  加上珍妮又不上班
<16-4,RYAN>With Jenny not working and all the baby expenses,

357
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,050
<16-4,RYAN>我都快入不敷出了
<16-4,RYAN>I'm barely making ends meet.

358
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:08,030
<16-4,RYAN>可能有必要再找一份工作了
<16-4,RYAN>Probably gonna have to get a second job.

359
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,870
<16-5,ESPOSITO>他们好像在给仓库招聘保安
<16-5,ESPOSITO>Looks like they're hiring security guards down at their warehouse.

361
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:15,640
<16-5,ESPOSITO>你穿上保安的衣服一定不错
<16-5,ESPOSITO>A Rent-a-Cop uniform would look good on you.

362
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,360
<16-6,RYAN>死者的桌子里有什么见不得人的秘密吗
<16-6,RYAN>Find any dark secrets in our victim's desk?

363
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,750
<16-7,ESPOSITO>没有  这人简直是个圣人
<16-7,ESPOSITO>Nah. This guy's a saint.

<16-7,ESPOSITO>给慈善机构捐钱  他的员工也喜欢他
<16-7,ESPOSITO>He gives to charity, his employees love him.

365
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:24,560
<16-7,ESPOSITO>在我看来
<16-7,ESPOSITO>As far as I can tell,

366
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,170
<16-7,ESPOSITO>他根本就没有什么肮脏  见不得...
<16-7,ESPOSITO>there's no indication of any dirty, little secr...

376
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,370
<17-4,CASTLE>她跟威利格是什么关系
<17-4,CASTLE>What's her relation to Williger?

377
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:47,680
<17-5,ESPOSITO>-我们还在查她的背景  -我有个想法
<17-5,ESPOSITO>- We're still running background. - I may have a guess.

378
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,120
<17-6,RYAN>沃利的妻子说他们的狗死了以后他的行为就变了
<17-6,RYAN>Wally's wife said that his behavior changed after their dog died.

379
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,210
<17-6,RYAN>我去跟兽医确认了一下
<17-6,RYAN>I checked with the vet.

380
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:53,440
<17-6,RYAN>原来  那事没有那么简单
<17-6,RYAN>Turns out, there's a whole lot more to that story.

381
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,290
<17-6,RYAN>沃利让兽医不要写进报告里
<17-6,RYAN>Now, Wally asked the vet to keep it out of the report

382
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:56,630
<17-6,RYAN>为的是不让他妻子伤心
<17-6,RYAN>so as not to upset his wife,

383
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:58,100
<17-6,RYAN>但那只狗不是正常地死了
<17-6,RYAN>but the dog didn't just die.

384
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,500
<17-7,CASTLE>-她是被毒死的  -毒死的
<17-7,CASTLE>- She was poisoned. - Poisoned?

385
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,360
<17-8,RYAN>是的  兽医想检测一下毒物是什么
<17-8,RYAN>Yes, the vet wanted to run a test to find out what the toxin was,

386
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,900
<17-8,RYAN>但出于某种原因  沃利坚决地拒绝了
<17-8,RYAN>but for some reason, Wally adamantly refused.

387
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,830
<17-8,RYAN>兽医说他好像很受触动
<17-8,RYAN>Vet said he seemed pretty shaken up about it.

388
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:09,840
<17-9,CASTLE>现在一切都说得通了
<17-9,CASTLE>Well, now it makes perfect sense.

389
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:11,140
<17-9,CASTLE>一部秘密电话
<17-9,CASTLE>A secret phone,

390
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:13,850
<17-9,CASTLE>跟门多萨爱巢的钥匙  对妻子撒谎
<17-9,CASTLE>keys to Mendoza's love nest, lying to his wife.

391
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:15,130
<17-9,CASTLE>这就是现实版《致命诱惑》
<17-9,CASTLE>This is "Fatal Attraction."

392
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:16,630
<17-9,CASTLE>沃利有了外遇
<17-9,CASTLE>Wally was having an affair,

393
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:17,540
<17-9,CASTLE>当他准备结束这一切时
<17-9,CASTLE>and when he tried to end it,

394
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,830
<17-9,CASTLE>娜塔莉不顾一切想要留住他
<17-9,CASTLE>Natalie went all Glenn Close on him,

395
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:20,600
<17-9,CASTLE>毒死他的狗就是为了警告他
<17-9,CASTLE>poisoning his poor dog to send a message.

396
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,930
<17-10,RYAN>这也解释了沃利翘班的原因
<17-10,RYAN>Would explain why wally started missing work --

397
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:24,280
<17-10,RYAN>为了和他的情妇待在一起
<17-10,RYAN>To spend time with his mistress.

398
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:27,120
<17-11,CASTLE>可最后  这还不够
<17-11,CASTLE>But in the end, wasn't enough.

399
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:31,610
<18-1,BECKETT>门多萨小姐  纽约警察
<18-1,BECKETT>Miss Mendoza, NYPD.

400
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,550
<18-1,BECKETT>门多萨小姐
<18-1,BECKETT>Miss Mendoza?

401
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,070
<18-2,CASTLE>门没锁
<18-2,CASTLE>Unlocked.

<18-2,CASTLE>有人吗  门多萨小姐
<18-2,CASTLE>Hello? Miss Mendoza?

403

<18-3,BECKETT>有人吗
<18-3,BECKETT>Hello?

404
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,200

<18-4,BECKETT>Blood.

405
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,840
<18-5,BECKETT>看上去好像她被割喉了
<18-5,BECKETT>It looks like her throat's been slit.

406
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:20,980
<18-5,BECKETT>你是化妆师
<18-5,BECKETT>You're a makeup artist?

407
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,850
<19-1,BECKETT>大多数是给低成本恐怖片做特效
<19-1,BECKETT>Mostly for low-budget horror.

408
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:25,260
<19-2,NATALIE MENDOZA>我整个早上都在修整这副新妆容
<19-2,NATALIE MENDOZA>I spent all morning testing out this new look

409
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,930
<19-2,NATALIE MENDOZA>然后就睡了个午觉
<19-2,NATALIE MENDOZA>and then went to take a nap.

410
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:29,050
<19-3,CASTLE>我能说这幅新的妆容
<19-3,CASTLE>Can I just say, the new look --

411
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,940
<19-3,CASTLE>很像那么回事
<19-3,CASTLE>Very effective.

412

<19-8,BECKETT>娜塔莉  不要说谎
<19-8,BECKETT>Natalie, please don't lie to us.

<19-10,CASTLE>你越是否认  你看上去越有嫌疑
<19-10,CASTLE>The more you deny it, the guiltier you look.

420
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:51,100
<19-11,NATALIE>有什么嫌疑啊
<19-11,NATALIE>The guiltier I look for what?

<19-17,NATALIE>他雇我教他怎么用舞台化妆油彩
<19-17,NATALIE>He hired me to teach him to use theatrical makeup.

429
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:14,470
<19-18,BECKETT>他为什么要用舞台化妆油彩
<19-18,BECKETT>Why would he need to use theatrical makeup?

430
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:16,460
<19-19,NATALIE>为了一个他在做的研究项目
<19-19,NATALIE>Uh, for a research project he was doing.

<19-20,CASTLE>To what?

434
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:25,340
<19-21,NATALIE>他说他在研究社会对衰老的反应
<19-21,NATALIE>Um, he said he was studying society's reaction to aging

435
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:29,210
<19-21,NATALIE>让我把他化成
<19-21,NATALIE>and wanted my help to transform him

436
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,550
<19-21,NATALIE>一个七十岁的老头
<19-21,NATALIE>In -- into a 70-year-old man.

437
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:38,960
<20-1,ESPOSITO>失踪  化妆  这些都说不通
<20-1,ESPOSITO>Missing time, makeup? None of this makes any sense.

438
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,380
<20-1,ESPOSITO>一个玩具公司的总裁
<20-1,ESPOSITO>What's the C.E.O. Of a toy company

439
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,110
<20-1,ESPOSITO>为什么要偷偷地变装成一个老头呢
<20-1,ESPOSITO>doing secretly dressing up as an old man?

440
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:44,030
<20-2,CASTLE>我不知道  但娜塔莉说她只是教沃利
<20-2,CASTLE>I don't know, but Natalie said she only taught Wally

<20-2,CASTLE>怎么把化妆油彩涂到他的手和脸上
<20-2,CASTLE>how to apply the makeup to his hands and face.

442
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:48,700
<20-3,RYAN>这也是凶手刷掉的部位
<20-3,RYAN>The same parts of the body the killer scrubbed.

443
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,260
<20-3,RYAN>-他想除掉那些油彩  -对
<20-3,RYAN>- He was trying to remove the makeup. - Right.

444
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,850
<20-4,CASTLE>所以杀害沃利的凶手
<20-4,CASTLE>So Wally's murder

445
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:53,930
<20-4,CASTLE>一定和他的隐秘身份有着某种联系
<20-4,CASTLE>is connected to his secret identity somehow.

446
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:56,180
<20-5,BECKETT>你们知道沃利口袋里的那张收据吗
<20-5,BECKETT>You know that receipt that was in Wally's pocket,

<20-7,BECKETT>你知道吗  让他们再去查一次
<20-7,BECKETT>You know what? Have them canvass it again.

451
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:06,150
<20-7,BECKETT>我们可能找错人了
<20-7,BECKETT>We may have been looking for the wrong man.

<22-11,CASTLE>我往返用不了几个小时
<22-11,CASTLE>I'll be there and back a couple of hours.

488
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:39,180
<22-12,BECKETT>不行  出了这么多岔子
<22-12,BECKETT>No! Not after everything we've been through.

489
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,430
<22-12,BECKETT>你绝不能自己一个人去
<22-12,BECKETT>You're not going alone.

490
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:42,250
<22-13,ALEXIS>她说得对  你不能自己过去
<22-13,ALEXIS>She's right, dad. You can't go by yourself.

491
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,440
<22-13,ALEXIS>我和你一起去
<22-13,ALEXIS>I'll go with you.

<22-14,CASTLE>她和我一起去
<22-14,CASTLE>Yes. She'll go with me.

494
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:50,500
<22-15,BECKETT>我们不知道那边什么情况
<22-15,BECKETT>We have no idea what's out there,

495
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,690
<22-15,BECKETT>也不知道什么人会在那里
<22-15,BECKETT>no idea who's out there.

496
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:53,000
<22-15,BECKETT>太冒险了
<22-15,BECKETT>That's too risky.

497
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:55,790
<22-16,CASTLE>那可是加拿大  能有多危险
<22-16,CASTLE>It's Canada. How risky could it be?

498
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,490
<22-16,CASTLE>而且我得提醒你  我是成年人
<22-16,CASTLE>And need I remind you, I'm a grown man.

<22-17,BECKETT>But only because I know

504
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:08,810
<22-17,BECKETT>完全是因为我知道她在你身边你不会犯傻
<22-17,BECKETT>you're not gonna do anything stupid if she's with you.

505
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,890
<22-17,BECKETT>-别让他做任何蠢事  -我保证
<22-17,BECKETT>- Don't let him do anything stupid. - Promise.

<22-19,CASTLE>拿你护照去  我来买机票
<22-19,CASTLE>Grab your passport. I'll get the tickets.

508
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,540
<22-20,BECKETT>警员用老头样子的照片
<22-20,BECKETT>Hey, so uniforms re-canvassed at that coffee shop

509
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:19,960
<22-21,ESPOSITO>重新排查了那家咖啡店
<22-21,ESPOSITO>using the geezer photo.

510
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,930
<22-21,ESPOSITO>有线索了
<22-21,ESPOSITO>They got a hit.

511
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:24,110
<22-21,ESPOSITO>一位顾客认出老沃利是附近的一名租客
<22-21,ESPOSITO>A patron identified old-man Wally as a tenant at a nearby building.

512
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:25,360
<22-22,BECKETT>好的  我马上到
<22-22,BECKETT>Okay. I'll be right there.

513
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,880
<23-1,ESPOSITO>现在我们知道沃利的钥匙是哪里的了
<23-1,ESPOSITO>Now we know what Wally's keys were to.

514
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:36,030
<23-2,BECKETT>他租了多久了
<23-2,BECKETT>How long has he had this place?

515
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:38,380
<23-3,ESPOSITO>管理员说他是三周之前开始租的
<23-3,ESPOSITO>Super said he rented it three weeks ago.

516
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:39,200
<23-3,ESPOSITO>现金支付的
<23-3,ESPOSITO>Paid cash.

517
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,710
<23-3,ESPOSITO>他是扮成老头的样子租的
<23-3,ESPOSITO>At least the old-man version of him did.

518
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:42,580
<23-4,BECKETT>这明显是他用来乔装打扮的地方
<23-4,BECKETT>Yeah, this is obviously where he came to change.

519
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,920
<23-5,RYAN>不过是为了什么呢
<23-5,RYAN>Yeah. But to do what?

520
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,530
<23-6,BECKETT>让鉴证科搜查一下房间
<23-6,BECKETT>Have CSU sweep the room.

521
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,470
<23-6,BECKETT>和周围邻居谈谈
<23-6,BECKETT>Let's talk to neighbors,

522
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:47,760
<23-6,BECKETT>说不定他们看到了什么
<23-6,BECKETT>see if they saw anything.

524
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,460
<24-1,ALEXIS>就是这  照片里那栋建筑
<24-1,ALEXIS>That's it -- the building in the photo.

525
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:11,060
<24-1,ALEXIS>看起来眼熟吗
<24-1,ALEXIS>Any of it look familiar?

526
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,470
<24-2,CASTLE>一点也不
<24-2,CASTLE>No.

527
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:14,180
<24-3,ALEXIS>你真觉得答案就在里面吗
<24-3,ALEXIS>You really think the answer's inside?

528
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:16,480
<24-4,CASTLE>只有一个办法才能知道
<24-4,CASTLE>Only one way to find out.

529
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:18,860
<24-5,ALEXIS>爸  你要去哪里
<24-5,ALEXIS>Dad, where are you going?

530
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,560
<24-6,CASTLE>打开38号箱子
<24-6,CASTLE>Open box number 38.

531
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:23,210
<24-7,ALEXIS>你不能就这样走进保险箱室
<24-7,ALEXIS>You can't just walk into a safe deposit room.

532
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:25,570
<24-7,ALEXIS>你需要账号  签名卡
<24-7,ALEXIS>You need account info, signature cards.

533
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:27,700
<24-7,ALEXIS>我们都不确定这把钥匙就是这里的
<24-7,ALEXIS>We don't even know if that key came from here.

534
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,160
<24-8,CASTLE>我自有办法
<24-8,CASTLE>I have a plan.

535
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:30,980
<24-9,ALEXIS>爸
<24-9,ALEXIS>Dad.

536
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,640
<25-1,CASTLE>你好  能不能帮我一个忙
<25-1,CASTLE>Hi, there. I wonder if you can help me.

537
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,690
<25-1,CASTLE>我想租一个保险箱
<25-1,CASTLE>I'd like to rent a safe deposit box.

538
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,960
<25-1,CASTLE>邻居不记得有任何访客
<25-1,CASTLE>So, the neighbor doesn't remember any visitors

539
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,450
<25-1,CASTLE>也从没有见过年轻的沃利
<25-1,CASTLE>and she never saw young Wally,

540
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:45,840
<26-1,BECKETT>但是老沃利给她钱让她帮忙遛狗和喂养
<26-1,BECKETT>but old Wally was paying her to walk and feed the dog.

541
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,260
<26-1,BECKETT>另一栋公寓  另一条狗  穿成这样
<26-1,BECKETT>Another apartment, another dog, dressing up like this.

542
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:49,320
<26-2,ESPOSITO>这家伙到底想干什么
<26-2,ESPOSITO>What was this guy doing?

543
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:49,730
<44-7,CASTLE>我不知道
<44-7,CASTLE>I don't know,

544
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:51,260
<26-2,ESPOSITO>不论是什么  他因此被害
<26-2,ESPOSITO>but whatever it was, it got him killed.

545
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,850
<26-3,BECKETT>你把它带到兽医那里看看
<26-3,BECKETT>Why don't you take him to the vet?

546
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:53,820
<26-3,BECKETT>也许它身上有那种芯片
<26-3,BECKETT>Maybe he's got a microchip

547
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,090
<26-3,BECKETT>可以告诉我们它是哪来的
<26-3,BECKETT>that will tell us where he came from.

548
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:56,490
<26-4,ESPOSITO>-这就去  -贝克特
<26-4,ESPOSITO>- Right on. - Hey, beckett.

549
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:00,420
<26-5,RYAN>看来老头子喜欢中餐
<26-5,RYAN>Looks like our old man was fond of chinese food.

550
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:03,270
<26-5,RYAN>这个餐馆离这六站地铁
<26-5,RYAN>This is from a restaurant half a dozen subway stops away.

552
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:04,640
<26-6,BECKETT>叫外卖可有点远啊
<26-6,BECKETT>That's a long way to go for takeout.

553
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,470
<26-7,RYAN>是啊  我打电话过去
<26-7,RYAN>Yeah, so I called over there.

554
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:10,370
<26-7,RYAN>发现过去几周老沃利常去那吃饭
<26-7,RYAN>Turns out old-man Wally was a regular the last several weeks,

555
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:12,920
<26-7,RYAN>每天晚上都逗留到很晚  一直付现金
<26-7,RYAN>stopping by late every other night, always paying cash.

556
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,170
<26-8,BECKETT>不管他去哪  一定在餐馆附近
<26-8,BECKETT>So, wherever he was going, it was near that restaurant.

<31-8,BECKETT>这就是他乔装的原因
<31-8,BECKETT>That's why he made himself up.

603
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:04,270
<31-8,BECKETT>他不希望被他的员工认出
<31-8,BECKETT>He didn't want his employees to recognize him.

604
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,780
<31-9,RYAN>什么样的总裁
<31-9,RYAN>What's a C.E.O. Of a company

605
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:09,220
<31-9,RYAN>会在自己公司做门卫呢
<31-9,RYAN>doing working as a janitor in his own warehouse?

606
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,610
<31-9,RYAN>他是卧底老板
<31-9,RYAN>It's undercover boss.

607
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:14,120
<31-10,BECKETT>但是他做卧底是为了什么
<31-10,BECKETT>But what was he going undercover for?

608
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:20,510
<32-1,MAC>他是个很安静的人  独来独往
<32-1,MAC>He was a quiet guy. He kept to himself mostly.

609
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:23,770
<32-1,MAC>我从没想到他是总裁
<32-1,MAC>I never would have guessed he was the C.E.O.

610
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,800
<32-2,BECKETT>-上周五他在这上班吗  -是的
<32-2,BECKETT>- Was he working here last Friday? - Yeah.

611
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:27,670
<32-3,MAC>他4点开始值班
<32-3,MAC>In fact, he came in for his shift at 4:00.

612
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:28,620
<32-3,MAC>11点离开
<32-3,MAC>He left at 11:00.

613
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,230
<32-3,MAC>到周一的时候  他就没来上班了
<32-3,MAC>And then on Monday, he didn't show.

614
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,980
<32-4,RYAN>那天有什么不寻常的事情发生吗
<32-4,RYAN>Did anything unusual happen that day?

615
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:34,280
<32-5,MAC>-我想没有  -威利格先生来做卧底
<32-5,MAC>- I don't think so. - Well, were there any problems here,

616
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:37,630
<32-6,BECKETT>-是不是因为这里出了什么问题  -没有
<32-6,BECKETT>- any reason that Mr. Williger would want to go undercover? - No.

617
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:38,720
<32-7,MAC>上个月他和他的团队
<32-7,MAC>He and his team came in

618
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,380
<32-7,MAC>来过这做季度视察
<32-7,MAC>last month for their quarterly inspection,

619
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,360
<32-7,MAC>我们得到了令人欣喜的报告
<32-7,MAC>and we got a glowing report.

620
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,140
<32-8,RYAN>那他在做门卫的这段期间呢
<32-8,RYAN>Well, how about when he was here as a janitor?

621
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:46,950
<32-8,RYAN>他做了或说了什么不寻常的事情吗
<32-8,RYAN>Did he do or say anything out of the ordinary?

622
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:48,880
<32-9,WORKER>上周发生了一件事
<32-9,WORKER>There was that thing last week.

623
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:50,450
<32-10,RYAN>什么事
<32-10,RYAN>Ah. What thing?

624
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:53,710
<32-11,MAC>有个保安抓到他下班后在后勤办公室里
<32-11,MAC>One of the guards caught him in the back office after hours

625
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,290
<32-11,MAC>翻阅文件
<32-11,MAC>riffling through some paperwork.

626
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:56,270
<32-12,BECKETT>什么文件
<32-12,BECKETT>What kind of paperwork?

627
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:57,600
<32-13,MAC>主要是货单
<32-13,MAC>Manifests mostly,

628
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,570
<32-13,MAC>我们工厂的跟踪物流
<32-13,MAC>tracking shipments from our factories.

629
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:00,820
<32-13,MAC>保安警告了他
<32-13,MAC>The guard admonished him.

630
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,760
<32-13,MAC>他道歉了  大家就当这事算了
<32-13,MAC>He apologized. Everybody moved on.

631
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,630
<32-14,BECKETT>我们要看一下这些货单
<32-14,BECKETT>Well, we need to see those manifests.

632
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,470
<33-1,BECKETT>我问了他妻子  同事
<33-1,BECKETT>I talked to his wife, his colleagues.

633
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:10,840
<33-1,BECKETT>知不知道沃利在仓库做什么
<33-1,BECKETT>If any of them know what Wally was doing around his warehouse,

634
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:12,300
<33-1,BECKETT>他们都说不知情
<33-1,BECKETT>they're not admitting to it.

635
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,690
<33-1,BECKETT>你呢  有什么发现
<33-1,BECKETT>How about you? What'd you find?

636
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:15,240
<33-2,RYAN>除了我们国家
<33-2,RYAN>Aside from our country outsourcing

637
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,230
<33-2,RYAN>把制造环节都外包给了亚洲
<33-2,RYAN>all its manufacturing needs to Asia,

638
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:18,650
<33-2,RYAN>一切都很正常
<33-2,RYAN>everything seems to be in order.

639
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,200
<33-3,ESPOSITO>慢点  慢点
<33-3,ESPOSITO>Slow down, slow down.

640
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:23,400
<33-4,BECKETT>-进展如何  -三振出局了
<33-4,BECKETT>- How'd it go? - Struck out.

641
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,630
<33-5,ESPOSITO>流浪狗没有装微型芯片
<33-5,ESPOSITO>Rover here didn't have a microchip,

642
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:26,280
<33-5,ESPOSITO>所以没法知道它是哪来的
<33-5,ESPOSITO>so we still don't know where he came from,

643
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:27,860
<33-5,ESPOSITO>但兽医说他非常健康
<33-5,ESPOSITO>but the vet said he's in perfect health.

644
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:30,280
<33-6,RYAN>我不明白的是  他为什么还有条狗
<33-6,RYAN>You know what I don't get? Why did he have a dog?

645
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,380
<33-6,RYAN>这是他卧底身份的一部分
<33-6,RYAN>I mean, was it part of his cover,

646
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,550
<33-6,RYAN>还是跟他那条死去的狗有关
<33-6,RYAN>or did it have something to do with his own dog's death?

647
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:36,090
<33-7,BECKETT>我们遗漏了一些细节
<33-7,BECKETT>We're missing something,

648
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:38,000
<33-7,BECKETT>补上那些  一切就说得通了
<33-7,BECKETT>something that makes all of this make sense.

649
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,880
<33-7,BECKETT>莱恩  查一下沃利失踪当晚
<33-7,BECKETT>Ryan, can you look into security and street-camera footage

650
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,260
<33-7,BECKETT>仓库周围的监控录像
<33-7,BECKETT>around Wally's warehouse the night that he disappeared?

651
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,450
<33-7,BECKETT>我要知道他去哪了
<33-7,BECKETT>I want to find out where he went.

652
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:45,760
<33-8,RYAN>好的  走  狗狗
<33-8,RYAN>Right. Come on, boy.

653
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,130
<33-9,CASTLE>凯特
<33-9,CASTLE>Kate.

654
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:52,450
<33-10,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<33-10,BECKETT>Castle?

655
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,360
<34-1,BECKETT>记忆卡
<34-1,BECKETT>A memory card.

656
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:02,760
<34-2,CASTLE>三张记忆卡放在三个信封里
<34-2,CASTLE>Yeah, there were three of them in three separate envelopes --

657
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:05,300
<34-2,CASTLE>一个给阿丽克西斯  一个给我妈  另一个给你
<34-2,CASTLE>one for Alexis, one for my mother, and one for you.

658
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:06,760
<34-3,BECKETT>里面有什么
<34-3,BECKETT>What's on it?

659
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:13,910
<34-4,CASTLE>看吧
<34-4,CASTLE>Watch.

660
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,680
<34-5,CASTLE>凯特  如果你正在看
<34-5,CASTLE>Kate, if you're seeing this...

661
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:28,900
<34-5,CASTLE>如果看到这段片子  我可能已经死了
<34-5,CASTLE>Well, if you're seeing this, I'm probably dead.

662
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:33,170
<34-5,CASTLE>我想让你知道  我从没打算要离开你
<34-5,CASTLE>I-I want you to know, I never intended to leave you,

663
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:35,530
<34-5,CASTLE>不会像这样  不会在我们结婚当天
<34-5,CASTLE>not like this, not on our wedding day,

664
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:37,230
<34-5,CASTLE>但我身不由己
<34-5,CASTLE>but I-it wasn't my choice.

665
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:41,540
<34-5,CASTLE>我希望我能告诉你这是怎么回事
<34-5,CASTLE>I wish I could tell you what's going on.

666
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:44,650
<34-5,CASTLE>我...希望我能解释
<34-5,CASTLE>I...wish I could explain.

667
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,180
<34-5,CASTLE>你只需知道  我爱你
<34-5,CASTLE>But just know that I love you.

668
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,510
<34-5,CASTLE>永远爱你
<34-5,CASTLE>I've always loved you.

669
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,360
<34-5,CASTLE>永远
<34-5,CASTLE>Always.

670
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:04,630
<34-6,CASTLE>给阿丽克西斯和我妈的也差不多是这样
<34-6,CASTLE>The ones to Alexis and my mother were pretty much the same.

671
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:08,260
<34-6,CASTLE>凯特  我做了什么啊
<34-6,CASTLE>Kate, what did I do?

672
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:09,820
<34-6,CASTLE>我不知道
<34-6,CASTLE>Mm. I don't know.

673
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,570
<34-7,BECKETT>不知道
<34-7,BECKETT>I don't.

674
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:18,250
<34-7,BECKETT>或许我们有办法查出来
<34-7,BECKETT>But maybe there's a way we can find out.

675
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:21,390
<35-1,TORY ELLIS>文件里没有元数据
<35-1,TORY ELLIS>There's no metadata on the file,

676
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:22,850
<35-1,TORY ELLIS>也没有地理标签
<35-1,TORY ELLIS>and it wasn't geotagged.

677
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:25,910
<35-2,BECKETT>能不能查出它是在哪拍的
<35-2,BECKETT>Is there any other way to find out where this was taken?

678
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:27,040
<35-3,CASTLE>或许房间里有什么线索
<35-3,CASTLE>Maybe there's something in the room

679
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,500
<35-3,CASTLE>或者在音频里
<35-3,CASTLE>or something in the audio.

680
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:34,230
<35-4,TORY>录像是低画质的  没什么线索
<35-4,TORY>The recording's low quality, so there's not much to go on,

681
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,470
<35-4,TORY>但我会再挖掘一下
<35-4,TORY>but I'll see what I can dig up.

682
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:42,460
<36-1,CASTLE>真奇怪
<36-1,CASTLE>It's weird.

683
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,060
<36-1,CASTLE>我看到这个之前
<36-1,CASTLE>Before I saw that,

684
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:47,730
<36-1,CASTLE>只想知道我去了哪里  做了什么
<36-1,CASTLE>all I wanted to know was where I was and what I was doing.

685
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,460
<36-1,CASTLE>现在我不确定了
<36-1,CASTLE>Now I am not so sure.

686
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,800
<36-2,CASTLE>卧底老板有什么新进展了吗
<36-2,CASTLE>Any news on your undercover boss?

687
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:03,870
<36-3,BECKETT>所有的发现都导出了新的疑问
<36-3,BECKETT>Every answer just leads to more questions.

688
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,480
<36-3,BECKETT>我不知道他在仓库做了什么
<36-3,BECKETT>I have no idea what he was doing at that warehouse

689
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:10,270
<36-3,BECKETT>他跟狗在一起干什么
<36-3,BECKETT>or what this guy was doing with him.

690
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,670
<36-3,BECKETT>其实我很希望
<36-3,BECKETT>Actually, I was kind of hoping that you might be able

691
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:14,540
<36-3,BECKETT>你的疯狂理论能帮忙
<36-3,BECKETT>to help me with a crazy theory.

692
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:16,620
<36-4,CASTLE>抱歉  我黔驴技穷  亲一个怎么样
<36-4,CASTLE>Sorry. I'm fresh out. How about a kiss?

693
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:17,600
<36-5,BECKETT>更好
<36-5,BECKETT>Even better.

694
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:22,140
<36-6,CASTLE>他前世是个修女吧[大叔故意性别错乱]
<36-6,CASTLE>You think he was a nun in a previous life?

695
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,330
<37-1,CASTLE>警官  你口袋里有什么
<37-1,CASTLE>Detective, what do you have in your pocket?

696
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,850
<37-2,DETECTIVE>物证  搜查时找到的
<37-2,DETECTIVE>Evidence...from a bust.

697
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,110
<37-2,DETECTIVE>这女孩在贩毒
<37-2,DETECTIVE>The girl was dealing.

698
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:43,980
<37-3,BECKETT>他不是条普通的狗  是训练有素的缉毒犬
<37-3,BECKETT>So he's not just a dog. He's a trained drug dog.

699
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:46,270
<37-4,CASTLE>我想我又有疯狂理论了
<37-4,CASTLE>I think I have a crazy theory for you.

700
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,880
<38-1,ESPOSITO>你认为沃利在做的事是这个吗
<38-1,ESPOSITO>That's what you think Wally was up to?

701
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,170
<38-1,ESPOSITO>那是我听过的最疯狂的推论
<38-1,ESPOSITO>Well, that is the craziest story I've ever heard.

702
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:54,700
<38-2,CASTLE>我承认很疯狂
<38-2,CASTLE>I admit it's crazy,

703
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:56,630
<38-2,CASTLE>但这是唯一与所有事实相符的推论
<38-2,CASTLE>But it's the only story that matches all the facts.

704
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:57,930
<38-3,BECKETT>卡塞尔说得对
<38-3,BECKETT>Castle's right.

705
00:30:57,930 --> 00:30:59,890
<38-4,RYAN>就算对  也只是推论
<38-4,RYAN>Even if he is, it's still just a story.

706
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:01,060
<38-4,RYAN>我们没有证据
<38-4,RYAN>We don't have any proof.

707
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:05,630
<38-5,BECKETT>我想我知道该如何找证据了
<38-5,BECKETT>I think I know how we can find some.

708
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,880
<38-6,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你和我一起去吗
<38-6,BECKETT>Castle, you coming with me?

709
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:14,290
<38-7,CASTLE>你不介意的话  我想在这里待会儿
<38-7,CASTLE>Uh, if you don't mind, I'd like to stay here for a while.

710
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,560
<38-8,BECKETT>好的  我马上回来
<38-8,BECKETT>Okay. I'll be back soon.

711
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:18,390
<38-9,BECKETT>走吧  伙计们
<38-9,BECKETT>Come on, guys.

712
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,090
<39-1,CASTLE>有线索吗
<39-1,CASTLE>Any luck?

713
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:29,400
<39-2,TORY>你在城市里  我只知道这么多
<39-2,TORY>I know this much. You were in a city.

714
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,790
<39-3,CASTLE>-你怎么知道的  -窗户外
<39-3,CASTLE>- How can you tell? - Out the window.

715
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:35,810
<39-5,CASTLE>-完全一片白  -不是完全
<39-5,CASTLE>- It's completely white. - Not completely.

716
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:39,880
<39-6,TORY>摩天大楼
<39-6,TORY>Skyscrapers.

717
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:41,770
<39-7,CASTLE>-你知道这是哪里吗  -不知道
<39-7,CASTLE>- So, do you know where this is? - No.

718
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,370
<39-8,TORY>但窗外的景色
<39-8,TORY>But this view out the window,

719
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:45,910
<39-8,TORY>大厦的外形应该是独一无二的
<39-8,TORY>the configuration of buildings ought to be unique.

720
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:46,990
<39-9,CASTLE>这样说你可以找到
<39-9,CASTLE>So you can find it?

721
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:49,630
<39-10,TORY>理论上是  但将此数据
<39-10,TORY>Theoretically, but comparing this data set

722
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,830
<39-10,TORY>与全球3D地图作比较  所需时间太长
<39-10,TORY>to global 3D mapping would take forever

723
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:53,880
<39-10,TORY>我的计算机也没这个运算能力
<39-10,TORY>and more computing power than I have.

724
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:56,850
<39-11,CASTLE>如果范围缩小到一座城市呢
<39-11,CASTLE>What if we narrowed it to just one city?

725
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:58,130
<39-11,CASTLE>蒙特利尔  你可以找到吗
<39-11,CASTLE>Montreal? Could you do it then?

726
00:31:58,130 --> 00:32:00,380
<39-12,TORY>不知道  只能试试
<39-12,TORY>I don't know. Best I can do is try.

727
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:03,600
<40-1,ESPOSITO>无法想象收到自己这样的消息
<40-1,ESPOSITO>Can't imagine how freaky it must be getting a message

728
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:05,580
<40-1,ESPOSITO>却不记得录制的经过  该有多诡异
<40-1,ESPOSITO>like that from myself and not remember recording it.

729
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:06,660
<40-2,RYAN>他是如何应对这些的
<40-2,RYAN>How's he doing with it all?

730
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:09,060
<40-3,BECKETT>他需要答案  我们都需要
<40-3,BECKETT>He needs answers. We both do.

731
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,760
<41-1,CASTLE>你觉得需要多长时间
<41-1,CASTLE>How long do you think this is gonna take?

732
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:16,150
<41-2,TORY>我怎么知道  我甚至不确定有没有用
<41-2,TORY>Hell if I know. I'm not even sure it's going to work.

733
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:19,660
<41-3,TORY>我是艾利斯
<41-3,TORY>This is Ellis.

734
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:21,580
<41-3,TORY>马上来
<41-3,TORY>I'm on it.

735
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:30,570
<42-1,BECKETT>我们来看看卡塞尔的推论是否正确
<42-1,BECKETT>All right, let's see if Castle is right.

736
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:32,520
<42-2,RYAN>慢点  小子  慢点
<42-2,RYAN>Easy, boy. Easy!

737
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:34,470
<42-3,ESPOSITO>它发狂了
<42-3,ESPOSITO>He's really going crazy.

738
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:35,560
<42-4,RYAN>别这样  小子
<42-4,RYAN>Come on, boy.

739
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:36,740
<42-4,RYAN>不
<42-4,RYAN>No!

740
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:38,410
<42-5,MAC>别这样
<42-5,MAC>Come on!

741
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:47,710
<42-5,MAC>喂  怎么回事
<42-5,MAC>Hey. What the hell's going on here?

742
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:49,400
<42-6,BECKETT>这些箱子从哪里来的
<42-6,BECKETT>Where did these boxes come from?

743
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,130
<42-7,MAC>我们在中国的制造商
<42-7,MAC>Our manufacturer in China.

744
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:56,250
<42-8,BECKETT>看里面
<42-8,BECKETT>Check inside.

745
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:01,200
<43-10,BECKETT>毒品
<43-10,BECKETT>Drugs.

746
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:03,250
<42-9,BECKETT>谁负责这批货的
<42-9,BECKETT>Who's in charge of this shipment?

747
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:04,760
<42-9,BECKETT>麦克沃伊
<42-9,BECKETT>Mcavoy!

748
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:15,370
<42-11,MAC>放开我  我发誓  我没有杀他
<42-11,MAC>Let me go! I swear I didn't kill him!

749
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:17,050
<42-12,ESPOSITO>是吗  那是谁杀的
<42-12,ESPOSITO>Yeah? Then who did?

752
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:44,100
<43-1,MATT>对不起  斯托勒小姐  他们坚持要进来
<43-1,MATT>I'm sorry, miss Stoller. They insisted.

753
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:44,920
<43-2,MARSHA>没事  马特
<43-2,MARSHA>That's fine, Matt.

754
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:48,030
<43-2,MARSHA>我们在和威利格夫人过公司的账
<43-2,MARSHA>We were just going over the company's finances with Mrs. Williger.

755
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,020
<43-3,SAMANTHA>调查有进展吗
<43-3,SAMANTHA>Has there been any progress in the investigation?

756
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,050
<43-4,BECKETT>是的  有
<43-4,BECKETT>Yes, there has.

757
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,580
<43-4,BECKETT>我们知道了你丈夫被杀的原因
<43-4,BECKETT>We know why your husband was killed,

758
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:54,170
<43-4,BECKETT>是从你家的狗被杀开始的
<43-4,BECKETT>And it started with your dog.

759
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:56,350
<43-5,SAMANTHA>我的狗  安妮
<43-5,SAMANTHA>My dog? Annie?

760
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:57,910
<43-6,BECKETT>一个月前  你的丈夫
<43-6,BECKETT>Yeah, a month ago, your husband

761
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:00,690
<43-6,BECKETT>去了公司在布鲁克林的仓库
<43-6,BECKETT>went to the company warehouse in Brooklyn.

762
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:02,850
<43-6,BECKETT>我们相信他在那里的时候
<43-6,BECKETT>We believe that while he was there,

763
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:04,750
<43-6,BECKETT>他捡了一个阳光莎拉娃娃
<43-6,BECKETT>he picked up a sunshine Sarah doll

764
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,570
<43-6,BECKETT>给安妮做咬咬玩具
<43-6,BECKETT>to use as a chew toy for Annie.

765
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:08,850
<43-7,SAMANTHA>-是  它喜欢这些娃娃  -只是这一个令它没命
<43-7,SAMANTHA>- Yes, she loved those dolls. - Except this one killed her.

766
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,300
<43-9,MARSHA>你说什么呢
<43-9,MARSHA>What are you talking about?

767
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,640
<43-10,BECKETT>娃娃里有毒品
<43-10,BECKETT>There were drugs inside of it.

768
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:12,550
<43-11,MARSHA>这不可能
<43-11,MARSHA>That's impossible.

769
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,080
<43-12,ESPOSITO>沃利也是这样想的
<43-12,ESPOSITO>That's most likely what Wally thought

770
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,360
<43-12,ESPOSITO>所以他开始乔装
<43-12,ESPOSITO>and why he started wearing disguises,

771
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,860
<43-12,ESPOSITO>早下班  晚回家
<43-12,ESPOSITO>leaving early, and coming home late.

772
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:18,960
<43-13,BECKETT>他日复一日地去仓库
<43-13,BECKETT>He went back to the warehouse day after day

773
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,000
<43-13,BECKETT>想弄清楚是怎么回事
<43-13,BECKETT>trying to figure out what had happened

774
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:23,420
<43-13,BECKETT>直到他快查到真相时被他们杀害了
<43-13,BECKETT>until he got too close and they had him killed.

775
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:26,160
<43-14,SAMANTHA>-谁杀了他  -你仓库里的贩毒集团
<43-14,SAMANTHA>- Who had him killed? - The drug ring running out of your warehouse.

776
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:29,250
<43-15,BECKETT>他们把海洛因藏在那些娃娃里
<43-15,BECKETT>They were smuggling heroin into the country from China

777
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:30,710
<43-15,BECKETT>然后从中国走私过来
<43-15,BECKETT>inside of those dolls.

778
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:32,650
<43-16,ESPOSITO>斯托勒小姐  我们问过你的工头
<43-16,ESPOSITO>Miss Stoller, we talked to your foreman.

779
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:34,400
<43-16,ESPOSITO>他告诉我们夜班人员会先从娃娃中
<43-16,ESPOSITO>He told us how the night shift would remove the drugs

780
00:34:34,410 --> 00:34:36,480
<43-16,ESPOSITO>取出毒品  再把它们归入库存
<43-16,ESPOSITO>from the dolls before returning them to the inventory.

781
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,170
<43-17,MARSHA>我们库房的员工绝对不可能做这种事的
<43-17,MARSHA>There's no way our warehouse employees could pull that off.

782
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:42,500
<43-17,MARSHA>所有那些货都是从这里调配的
<43-17,MARSHA>All of those shipments are coordinated from here.

783
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,990
<43-18,BECKETT>没错  就在这间办公室里
<43-18,BECKETT>Yes. From this office.

784
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:45,880
<43-18,BECKETT>也就是说负责走私毒品的人
<43-18,BECKETT>Which means whoever was in charge of it

785
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:48,740
<43-18,BECKETT>肯定能拿到威利格先生的文件
<43-18,BECKETT>had to have had access to Mr. Williger's files.

786
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:53,900
<43-19,ESPOSITO>你这是去哪啊  兄弟
<43-19,ESPOSITO>Where you going, bro?

787
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,210
<43-20,MATT>我只是
<43-20,MATT>Oh, I'm just --

788
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:57,380
<43-21,RYAN>你跑不了的
<43-21,RYAN>You'll never make it.

789
00:34:57,530 --> 00:34:59,210
<43-22,MARSHA>-马特  -马特·门罗
<43-22,MARSHA>- Matt? - Matt Monroe.

790
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:01,640
<43-23,RYAN>他进公司前  一直住在亚洲
<43-23,RYAN>Before he joined the company, he was living over in Asia.

791
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,440
<43-23,RYAN>实际上  这正是威利格雇你的原因
<43-23,RYAN>In fact, that's one of the reasons Williger hired you,

792
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,260
<43-23,RYAN>因为你熟悉当地文化
<43-23,RYAN>your familiarity with local cultures.

793
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,930
<43-24,BECKETT>我想威利格先生没想到
<43-24,BECKETT>I guess Mr. Williger wasn't aware

794
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:10,560
<43-24,BECKETT>对亚洲文化的精通还包括海洛因交易
<43-24,BECKETT>that familiarity extended to their heroin trade.

795
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,720
<43-24,BECKETT>工头说你是这一切的幕后主使
<43-24,BECKETT>The foreman said you were behind the whole operation.

796
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,010
<43-26,ESPOSITO>-他撒谎  -是吗  他说他打过电话给你
<43-26,ESPOSITO>- He's lying. - Really? 'Cause he said that he called you,

797
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:16,800
<43-26,ESPOSITO>说他怀疑那个到处打探的
<43-26,ESPOSITO>told you he was suspicious

798
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:18,630
<43-26,ESPOSITO>新来的门卫
<43-26,ESPOSITO>about the new janitor who had been poking around

799
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,920
<43-26,ESPOSITO>你说你会处理的
<43-26,ESPOSITO>you said you'd take care of it?

800
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,640
<43-27,BECKETT>那正是威利格先生消失的那晚
<43-27,BECKETT>That was the same night that Mr. Williger disappeared.

801
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,650
<43-28,RYAN>发现那个老头居然是你老板
<43-28,RYAN>Must have been quite a surprise

802
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:24,480
<43-28,RYAN>你肯定吓了一跳吧
<43-28,RYAN>when you realized the old man was your boss.

803
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,050
<43-29,MATT>我跟这件事一点关系也没有
<43-29,MATT>I had nothing to do with this.

804
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,850
<43-30,RYAN>我们再次核查了街上的监控录像
<43-30,RYAN>We double-checked street cams.

805
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:31,400
<43-30,RYAN>这是沃利刚下班的时候  而你的车
<43-30,RYAN>This is your car three blocks from the warehouse

806
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,680
<43-30,RYAN>就停在离仓库三个街区外的地方
<43-30,RYAN>just after Wally ended his shift.

807
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:35,450
<43-31,BECKETT>而且我敢打赌我们提取的DNA样本
<43-31,BECKETT>And I bet the DNA samples that we collect

808
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:37,320
<43-31,BECKETT>也会证实我们所说的一切
<43-31,BECKETT>are gonna confirm what we already know.

809
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:42,640
<43-32,ESPOSITO>马特·门罗  你因谋杀
<43-32,ESPOSITO>Matt Monroe, you're under

810
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,430
<43-32,ESPOSITO>沃利·威利格而被捕
<43-32,ESPOSITO>arrest for the murder of Wally Williger.

811
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:48,790
<43-33,MARSHA>警探  如果沃利察觉到不妥
<43-33,MARSHA>Detective, if Wally knew something was wrong,

812
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:50,940
<43-33,MARSHA>他为什么要隐瞒所有人呢
<43-33,MARSHA>why did he hide it from everyone?

813
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:52,230
<43-34,BECKETT>他不知道可以信任谁
<43-34,BECKETT>He didn't know who he could trust,

814
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:53,810
<43-34,BECKETT>而他也不能去找有关部门  因为
<43-34,BECKETT>and he couldn't go to the authorities because --

815
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:54,850
<43-35,SAMANTHA>因为那样的话  我们公司
<43-35,SAMANTHA>Because our company name

816
00:35:54,850 --> 00:35:56,930
<43-35,SAMANTHA>就跟贩毒划上了等号
<43-35,SAMANTHA>would become synonymous with drug smuggling.

818
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:03,040
<43-37,TORY>我是托瑞  卡塞尔跟你在一起吗
<43-37,TORY>Hey, it's Tory. Is Castle with you?

819
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,120
<43-38,BECKETT>没啊  怎么了
<43-38,BECKETT>No. Why?

821
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:08,100
<43-39,TORY>我认为他可能去了蒙特利尔
<43-39,TORY>I think he might be in Montreal.

822
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:07,390
<44-1,HENRY JENKINS>你不该回来的
<44-1,HENRY JENKINS>You weren't supposed to come back.

823
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:08,980
<44-2,JENKINS>永远不该
<44-2,JENKINS>Ever.

824
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,090
<44-3,CASTLE>是你
<44-3,CASTLE>It's you.

825
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:13,420
<44-4,JENKINS>你记得什么
<44-4,JENKINS>What do you remember?

826
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,130
<44-5,CASTLE>什么都不记得
<44-5,CASTLE>Nothing.

827
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:16,440
<44-6,JENKINS>很好
<44-6,JENKINS>That's good.

828
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:20,280
<44-7,CASTLE>我知道你参与了此事
<44-7,CASTLE>I know you're involved.

829
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,550
<44-7,CASTLE>我也知道你清楚我身上发生了什么
<44-7,CASTLE>I know you know what happened to me.

830
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:23,960
<44-7,CASTLE>你是谁
<44-7,CASTLE>Who are you?

831
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,500
<44-8,JENKINS>你不能这么做
<44-8,JENKINS>You can't be doing this,

832
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:28,280
<44-8,JENKINS>到处问问题  还悬赏
<44-8,JENKINS>asking questions, offering rewards.

833
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,300
<44-8,JENKINS>这太危险了
<44-8,JENKINS>It's too dangerous.

834
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,520
<44-9,CASTLE>那就告诉我到底发生了什么
<44-9,CASTLE>Then tell me what happened.

835
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:33,160
<44-10,JENKINS>你没听明白  卡塞尔先生  你必须停手
<44-10,JENKINS>You're not listening, Mr. Castle. You need to stop.

836
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,270
<44-11,CASTLE>不然呢
<44-11,CASTLE>Or what?

837
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,530
<44-12,JENKINS>不然你将会发现真相
<44-12,JENKINS>Or you're going to find out the truth.

838
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:41,320
<44-12,JENKINS>而你说过你不想记得
<44-12,JENKINS>And you said you didn't want to remember.

839
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:44,980
<44-12,JENKINS>我们竭尽全力确保你不记得
<44-12,JENKINS>We went to great lengths to make sure that you didn't.

840
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,470
<44-12,JENKINS>但如果你继续找下去的话
<44-12,JENKINS>But if you keep looking...

841
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:50,310
<44-13,CASTLE>我绝不可能主动要求失忆
<44-13,CASTLE>There's no way in hell I asked for this.

842
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:51,280
<44-13,CASTLE>对不起
<44-13,CASTLE>I'm sorry.

843
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:53,530
<44-14,JENKINS>但这真是你要求的
<44-14,JENKINS>But you did.

844
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,360
<44-15,CASTLE>我不信你
<44-15,CASTLE>I don't believe you.

<44-16,JENKINS>霍兰德森林  卡塞尔先生

846
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:03,350
<44-16,JENKINS>你11岁那年二月里的一天
<44-16,JENKINS>That February day when you were 11 years old.

847
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:05,520
<44-17,CASTLE>不
<44-17,CASTLE>No.

848
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:06,760
<44-18,JENKINS>那天发生的事
<44-18,JENKINS>What happened to you there,

849
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:10,430
<44-18,JENKINS>才是你成为罪案作家的真正原因
<44-18,JENKINS>the real reason you became a mystery writer.

850
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:11,460
<44-18,JENKINS>你怎么会
<44-18,JENKINS>How did you...

851
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:15,030
<44-19,CASTLE>我从来没跟任何人说过那件事
<44-19,CASTLE>I never told anyone about that.

852
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:15,820
<44-19,CASTLE>不
<44-19,CASTLE>No.

853
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:18,600
<44-20,JENKINS>贝克特不知道  你家人也不知道
<44-20,JENKINS>Not Beckett, not your family.

854
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:21,390
<44-20,JENKINS>但你告诉了我
<44-20,JENKINS>But you told me,

855
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,650
<44-20,JENKINS>三周前
<44-20,JENKINS>three weeks ago

856
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:28,170
<44-20,JENKINS>以便遇到现在这种情况  你有证据
<44-20,JENKINS>so that if this ever happened, you'd have proof.

857
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:33,120
<44-20,JENKINS>你会知道是你要求被抹去记忆
<44-20,JENKINS>You'd know that you were the one who asked to forget.

858
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:37,900
<44-21,CASTLE>我要求的
<44-21,CASTLE>I asked for this?

859
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,930
<44-22,JENKINS>有些谜题本就不该被解开
<44-22,JENKINS>Some mysteries aren't meant to be solved.

860
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:43,670
<44-22,JENKINS>都结束了
<44-22,JENKINS>It's over now.

861
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:45,480
<44-22,JENKINS>回家
<44-22,JENKINS>Go home.

862

<44-22,JENKINS>好好生活  忘了这一切发生过
<44-22,JENKINS>Live your life. Forget this ever happened.

863
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:54,130
<44-22,JENKINS>这是你的意愿
<44-22,JENKINS>It's what you wanted.

864
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:07,120
<45-1,ALEXIS>你怎么能孤身前去  不告诉我们
<45-1,ALEXIS>How could you go up there on your own and not even tell us?

865
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,990
<45-2,CASTLE>因为我知道你会阻止我
<45-2,CASTLE>Because I knew you would try and stop me,

866
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:10,800
<45-2,CASTLE>我想知道真相  但...
<45-2,CASTLE>and I needed to know, but...

867
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,260
<45-2,CASTLE>但现在
<45-2,CASTLE>But now...

868
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:19,000
<45-2,CASTLE>我会做了什么穷凶极恶之事
<45-2,CASTLE>what could I have done that was so bad

869
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,880
<45-2,CASTLE>以致于我让他们抹去我的记忆呢
<45-2,CASTLE>that I asked them to make me forget?

870
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,720
<45-3,ALEXIS>也许你什么也没做
<45-3,ALEXIS>Maybe you didn't do anything.

871
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:27,080
<45-3,ALEXIS>也许你发现了什么糟糕的事情
<45-3,ALEXIS>Maybe you found out something terrible

872
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:30,510
<45-3,ALEXIS>或是目睹了什么你不想一辈子记着的事情
<45-3,ALEXIS>or witnessed something you didn't want to have to live with.

873
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:34,750
<45-4,MARTHA>或许过去的两个月就像是潘多拉盒子
<45-4,MARTHA>Or maybe the past two months is like pandora's box

874
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,660
<45-4,MARTHA>不该被打开
<45-4,MARTHA>and shouldn't be opened.

875
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:45,600
<46-1,CASTLE>我对他们和你的所作所为
<46-1,CASTLE>What I did to them, to you...

876
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:49,350
<46-1,CASTLE>我怎么能就这么忘却
<46-1,CASTLE>how am I supposed to just let that go?

877
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,060
<46-1,CASTLE>我不知道
<46-1,CASTLE>I don't know.

878
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:55,540
<46-2,BECKETT>我妈妈的谋杀案我也想忘却来着
<46-2,BECKETT>I tried with my mom's murder.

879
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,550
<46-2,BECKETT>遇到你之前  一直被我埋在心底
<46-2,BECKETT>I buried it until you came along.

880
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,160
<46-3,CASTLE>你认为有可能吗
<46-3,CASTLE>You think it's possible?

881
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:06,540
<46-3,CASTLE>在不知真相的情况下生活下去
<46-3,CASTLE>To live with it without ever knowing?

882
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:09,240
<46-3,CASTLE>卡塞尔
<46-3,CASTLE>Oh, Castle...

883
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,100
<46-4,BECKETT>不是一码事
<46-4,BECKETT>This is completely different.

884
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:21,100
<46-4,BECKETT>你身上不管发生了什么事  你已经知道了真相
<46-4,BECKETT>Whatever happened to you, you already knew the truth,

885
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:25,020
<46-4,BECKETT>你决定你不想记得这件事
<46-4,BECKETT>and you decided that you didn't want to remember it anymore.

886
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:28,800
<46-4,BECKETT>尽管我们都很想知道事情的原委
<46-4,BECKETT>And as much as we wanted to know the answers,

887
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:33,030
<46-4,BECKETT>但如果你做了决定  一定事出有因
<46-4,BECKETT>if you decided that, then there had to have been a reason.

888
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,600
<46-5,CASTLE>也许这就是我要他们抹去我记忆的原因
<46-5,CASTLE>Maybe that's why I asked them to make me forget.

889
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,880
<46-5,CASTLE>以便我能回到你身边
<46-5,CASTLE>So I could come home to you.

890
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,150
<46-6,CASTLE>你知道吗
<46-6,CASTLE>You know what?

891
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:45,890
<46-7,BECKETT>什么
<46-7,BECKETT>What?

892
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:48,820
<46-8,CASTLE>我们应该结婚
<46-8,CASTLE>We should get married.

893
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,050
<46-8,CASTLE>明早就结
<46-8,CASTLE>Tomorrow, first thing.

894
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:52,640
<46-8,CASTLE>忘掉这一切  你看如何
<46-8,CASTLE>Put all this behind us. What do you say?

895
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:55,460
<46-8,CASTLE>卡塞尔
<46-8,CASTLE>Castle...

896
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:01,620
<46-9,BECKETT>我很想嫁给你
<46-9,BECKETT>...there is nothing that I want more than to marry you,

897
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:02,850
<46-9,BECKETT>但这样不行
<46-9,BECKETT>but not like this.

898
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,810
<46-10,CASTLE>你还没准备好
<46-10,CASTLE>You're not ready?

899
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:07,200
<46-10,CASTLE>不  我们都没准备好
<46-10,CASTLE>No. We're both not ready.

900
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:09,800
<46-11,BECKETT>我们在寻找一块结实的地面
<46-11,BECKETT>We're looking for solid ground,

901
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:12,690
<46-11,BECKETT>你以为结了婚就能让你释怀
<46-11,BECKETT>and you think getting married is gonna fix the way you feel,

902
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:13,790
<46-11,BECKETT>不会的
<46-11,BECKETT>and it won't.

903
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,030
<46-11,BECKETT>我爱你
<46-11,BECKETT>Look, I love you.

904
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,650
<46-11,BECKETT>我会站在你身边
<46-11,BECKETT>And I'm here for you.

905
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:23,360
<46-11,BECKETT>但我们需要一些空间
<46-11,BECKETT>But we need to get some distance from all of this.

906
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,220
<46-11,BECKETT>回到原来的生活
<46-11,BECKETT>We need to get back to our own lives,

907
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:28,190
<46-11,BECKETT>一起找到结实的地面
<46-11,BECKETT>find solid ground together.

908
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:31,070
<46-11,BECKETT>我向你保证  我哪都不会去
<46-11,BECKETT>I promise you, I'm not going anywhere.

909
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:35,980
<46-11,BECKETT>等了这么久  我希望一切十全十美
<46-11,BECKETT>We've waited this long, so let's just make it right.

910
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:38,520
<46-12,CASTLE>多久
<46-12,CASTLE>How long?

911
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:41,540
<46-14,CASTLE>一个月
<46-14,CASTLE>A month.

912
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:45,370
<46-13,BECKETT>没有期待  没有压力
<46-13,BECKETT>No expectations, no pressure.

913
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:47,190
<46-13,BECKETT>就你和我
<46-13,BECKETT>Just us.

914
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,390
<46-13,BECKETT>然后我们再谈结婚
<46-13,BECKETT>And then we'll talk about it then.

915
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:56,350
<46-14,CASTLE>一个月
<46-14,CASTLE>A month.

916
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,140
<46-14,CASTLE>就这么定了
<46-14,CASTLE>It's a date.
