1
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:30,550
<1-1,RICHARD CASTLE>好了  卡塞尔家的女士们
<1-1,RICHARD CASTLE>All right, ladies of the Castle household,

2
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:33,620
<1-1,RICHARD CASTLE>提醒一下  你们的圣诞诗篇
<1-1,RICHARD CASTLE>just a reminder that your portion for the holiday poem

3
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:36,530
<1-1,RICHARD CASTLE>要在72小时内完成
<1-1,RICHARD CASTLE>is due in less than 72 hours.

4
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:37,830
<1-2,ALEXIS CASTLE>我只差润色了
<1-2,ALEXIS CASTLE>I just have to do a polish.

5
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,920
<1-3,CASTLE>等不及了  你的呢
<1-3,CASTLE>I can't wait to see it. How's yours coming along?

6
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,120
<1-3,CASTLE>准备好在卡塞尔家
<1-3,CASTLE>Are you ready for your big debut

7
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,250
<1-3,CASTLE>圣诞贺卡上首次亮相了吗
<1-3,CASTLE>in the Castle family Christmas card?

8
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:45,620
<1-4,KATE BECKETT>当然了
<1-4,KATE BECKETT>Yeah, absolutely.

9
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:46,860
<1-5,CASTLE>今年会是最棒的一年
<1-5,CASTLE>It's gonna be the best year ever!

10
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:47,870
<1-5,CASTLE>是啊
<1-5,CASTLE>Yeah.

11
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:49,260
<1-6,CASTLE>好激动
<1-6,CASTLE>Excited!

12
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:53,260
<1-7,BECKETT>同志们  我完全忘了
<1-7,BECKETT>You guys, I completely forgot.

13
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:54,510
<1-7,BECKETT>他说不是大事的
<1-7,BECKETT>He said that it wasn't a big deal,

14
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:56,310
<1-7,BECKETT>但我觉得好像是件大事
<1-7,BECKETT>but I think it actually kind of is.

15
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,120
<1-8,ALEXIS>是相当大的事
<1-8,ALEXIS>It's a very big deal.

16
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:00,450
<1-8,ALEXIS>我们甚至会产生攀比心
<1-8,ALEXIS>We even get a little competitive.

19
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,680
<1-9,MARTHA RODGERS>我7月份就开始研究我的了
<1-9,MARTHA RODGERS>I started working on mine in July.

20
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,350
<1-9,MARTHA RODGERS>什么
<1-9,MARTHA RODGERS>Wh--

22
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:05,040
<1-11,ALEXIS>-欢迎加入我们家  -是啊
<1-11,ALEXIS>- Welcome to the family. - Yeah.

23
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:07,160
<1-13,BECKETT>我要做什么来着
<1-13,BECKETT>So what do I have to do again?

25
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,780
<1-14,ALEXIS>写六句风趣  辛辣又意味深长的句子
<1-14,ALEXIS>Write six funny, poignant, eloquent lines

26
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:13,440
<1-14,ALEXIS>描述过去一年中你的精彩时刻
<1-14,ALEXIS>describing highlights of the past year for you.

28
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,550
<1-16,ALEXIS>-简单  -还得押韵
<1-16,ALEXIS>- Oh. Yeah. - And they must rhyme.

29
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:16,310
<1-17,MARTHA>没错
<1-17,MARTHA>Yeah.

30
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,860
<1-18,BECKETT>"我完蛋了"跟什么押韵
<1-18,BECKETT>What word rhymes with "I'm screwed"?

32
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:26,660
<2-1,BECKETT>我就是不太擅长押韵什么的
<2-1,BECKETT>It's just that rhyming isn't exactly my thing.

33
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:29,150
<2-2,CASTLE>你可是没去舞会
<2-2,CASTLE>This coming from a woman who skipped prom

34
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:31,190
<2-2,CASTLE>而去参加诗歌比赛的人
<2-2,CASTLE>to crash a poetry slam?

35
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,530
<2-3,BECKETT>是朗诵  卡塞尔
<2-3,BECKETT>Spoken word, Castle.

36
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:33,950
<2-3,BECKETT>完全不是一码事
<2-3,BECKETT>That's a totally different jam.

37
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:36,100
<2-3,BECKETT>我可以给你写个俳句
<2-3,BECKETT>I mean, I could write a haiku for you instead.

38
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,580
<2-5,BECKETT>-这有违规则  -你还在乎起规矩来了
<2-5,BECKETT>- Nah, that's against the rules. - Since when do you follow rules?

39
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,180
<2-6,CASTLE>因为那是我的规矩
<2-6,CASTLE>Since I'm the one who made them.

40
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,180
<2-6,CASTLE>等我们去参加分局圣诞派对的时候
<2-6,CASTLE>You should probably get me your first draft

41
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,460
<2-6,CASTLE>你就把初稿给我看看吧
<2-6,CASTLE>by the time we get to the, uh, precinct holiday party.

42
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,490
<2-7,BECKETT>只剩两天了
<2-7,BECKETT>That's two days away.

43
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:47,010
<2-8,CASTLE>瞧  时间足够了
<2-8,CASTLE>See? Plenty of time.

44
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:50,910
<2-10,CASTLE>准备迎接一起有节日气氛的凶杀案吧
<2-10,CASTLE>So get ready for a murder with a little holiday spirit.

45
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,650
<2-11,ESPOSITO>大概晚10:30发生
<2-11,ESPOSITO>Went down around 10:30 p.m.

46
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:54,880
<2-11,ESPOSITO>目击证人看到一辆黑色野马  无牌照
<2-11,ESPOSITO>Witnesses saw a black mustang, no plates,

47
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,350
<2-11,ESPOSITO>追逐此人
<2-11,ESPOSITO>chasing after this guy.

48
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,030
<2-12,BECKETT>驾车枪杀案吗
<2-12,BECKETT>This was a drive-by?

49
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,220
<2-12,BECKETT>但他看上去是近距离开枪致死
<2-12,BECKETT>But he looks like he was shot close range.

50
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,550
<2-13,ESPOSITO>没错  枪手射击头部  确保他活不过来
<2-13,ESPOSITO>Yeah, and the shooter capped him in the head to finish him off.

51
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,010
<2-14,BECKETT>那么就不是随机杀人
<2-14,BECKETT>So this wasn't random.

52
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,930
<2-14,BECKETT>有人看到袭击者了吗
<2-14,BECKETT>Did anyone get a good look at the assailant?

53
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:08,190
<2-15,ESPOSITO>是的  他飞驰而过的时候看到的
<2-15,ESPOSITO>Yeah, when he drove by like a bat out of hell.

54
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,330
<2-15,ESPOSITO>毛绒绒的红帽子  白色的大胡子
<2-15,ESPOSITO>Fuzzy red hat, big white beard.

55
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,690
<2-16,BECKETT>不是吧  凶手是个圣诞老人
<2-16,BECKETT>Seriously, our killer is Santa Claus?

56
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:15,930
<2-17,ESPOSITO>三名目击者口供一致
<2-17,ESPOSITO>Three witnesses all told the same story.

57
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:18,410
<2-18,CASTLE>伙计们  爬下无数烟囱
<2-18,CASTLE>Guys. Squeezing down countless chimneys?

58
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:21,030
<2-18,CASTLE>一晚为上百万人递送礼物
<2-18,CASTLE>Delivering millions of presents in one night?

59
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,260
<2-18,CASTLE>这不可避免
<2-18,CASTLE>It's bound to happen.

60
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:24,620
<2-18,CASTLE>圣诞老人终于崩溃了
<2-18,CASTLE>Santa finally cracked.

61
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,020
<2-18,CASTLE>或者
<2-18,CASTLE>Or...

62
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:28,620
<2-19,ESPOSITO>被害人是个坏孩子  不是乖孩子
<2-19,ESPOSITO>Our victim was naughty instead of nice.

63
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,120
<2-20,CASTLE>这太没品了
<2-20,CASTLE>That's tasteless.

64
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,480
<2-21,BECKETT>或者凶手穿了圣诞老人的服装
<2-21,BECKETT>Or a killer just wore a santa suit

65
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,050
<2-21,BECKETT>因为这是这个时候最棒的伪装
<2-21,BECKETT>because that was the perfect disguise at this time of year.

66
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:37,010
<2-21,BECKETT>我们对被害人有什么了解
<2-21,BECKETT>So what do we know about the victim?

67
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,880
<2-22,ESPOSITO>他名叫埃里克·梅瑟  住在市中心
<2-22,ESPOSITO>His name is Eric Mercer. Lives in midtown.

68
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,170
<2-22,ESPOSITO>他的医院证件表明他是圣西蒙医院的急诊室医生
<2-22,ESPOSITO>His hospital I.D. says he's an E.R. doctor at St. Simon's.

69
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:45,140
<2-23,BECKETT>-知道他是从哪过来的吗  -还不知道
<2-23,BECKETT>- Do we know where he was coming from? - Not yet,

70
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,970
<2-24,ESPOSITO>但是他在六个街区外的
<2-24,ESPOSITO>but he bought a latte at a coffee shop

71
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:48,240
<2-24,ESPOSITO>一家咖啡店买过拿铁
<2-24,ESPOSITO>six blocks away from here

72
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,720
<2-24,ESPOSITO>随后才被持枪圣诞老人追赶
<2-24,ESPOSITO>before our gun-toting St. Nick came after him.

73
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,810
<2-24,ESPOSITO>咖啡师说
<2-24,ESPOSITO>And the barista there said that

74
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,730
<2-24,ESPOSITO>梅瑟当时背着蓝色背包
<2-24,ESPOSITO>Mercer was carrying a blue backpack.

75
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,680
<2-24,ESPOSITO>但看到梅瑟逃跑的人
<2-24,ESPOSITO>But witnesses who saw Mercer running

76
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,890
<2-24,ESPOSITO>称他没带背包
<2-24,ESPOSITO>said there wasn't any backpack.

77
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:59,730
<2-25,BECKETT>好吧  我们搜索从这里到咖啡店的区域
<2-25,BECKETT>Okay, let's set up a search from here to that coffee shop.

78
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:02,520
<2-25,BECKETT>背包里可能有他被杀原因的线索
<2-25,BECKETT>That backpack may contain clues as to why he was killed.

79
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,900
<2-26,KEVIN RYAN>或许梅瑟生前最后跟他说话的人
<2-26,KEVIN RYAN>Well, maybe the last person that Mercer talked to

80
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,350
<2-26,KEVIN RYAN>对此会有些见解
<2-26,KEVIN RYAN>can shed some light on that.

81
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:07,590
<2-26,KEVIN RYAN>他中枪前10分钟
<2-26,KEVIN RYAN>10 minutes before he was shot,

82
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,620
<2-26,KEVIN RYAN>埃里克·梅瑟给圣西蒙医院的一个人打了电话
<2-26,KEVIN RYAN>Eric Mercer called someone at St. Simon's hospital.

83
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,780
<2-26,KEVIN RYAN>是我  我几小时前才跟埃里克说过话
<2-26,KEVIN RYAN>That was me. I just talked to Eric a few hours ago.

84
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,370
<2-26,KEVIN RYAN>对不起  这太让人震惊了
<2-26,KEVIN RYAN>I'm sorry. This is just such a shock.

85
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:18,950
<3-1,BECKETT>你们说话时他什么情况
<3-1,BECKETT>How did he seem when you talked?

86
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:21,960
<3-2,DEB>有点紧张  似乎很匆忙
<3-2,DEB>A little on edge, I guess... like he was in a hurry.

87
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,240
<3-3,CASTLE>他有说原因吗
<3-3,CASTLE>Did he say why?

88
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:25,130
<3-4,DEB>我以为是因为他叔叔的事
<3-4,DEB>I assume it was his uncle.

89
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:27,060
<3-4,DEB>他叔叔得了癌症  一个人住
<3-4,DEB>His uncle has cancer and lives alone.

90
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,730
<3-4,DEB>埃里克想去陪伴他
<3-4,DEB>Eric tried to be there for him.

91
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:30,660
<3-4,DEB>他昨晚也没来上班
<3-4,DEB>He missed work last night, too.

92
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:31,870
<3-5,BECKETT>你知道叔叔的名字吗
<3-5,BECKETT>Do you know his name?

93
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:34,230
<3-6,DEB>爱德华吧  爱德华·梅瑟
<3-6,DEB>Edward, I think. Edward Mercer.

94
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,790
<3-6,DEB>或许他知道埃里克为什么会出这种事
<3-6,DEB>Maybe he knows why this happened to Eric.

95
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:41,520
<4-2,LANIE PARISH>有什么线索
<4-2,LANIE PARISH>What you got for me, girl?

96
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:45,380
<4-3,ESPOSITO>我在被害人外套胳膊上发现了这个
<4-3,ESPOSITO>I found these on the arm of the vic's jacket.

97
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,040
<4-4,LANIE>是种小晶体
<4-4,LANIE>Some kind of tiny crystals.

98
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,080
<4-5,ESPOSITO>他撞碎玻璃窗后跌在了圣诞装饰品上
<4-5,ESPOSITO>Could they be from the Christmas decorations that he landed on

99
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:50,210
<4-5,ESPOSITO>会不会是那上面的
<4-5,ESPOSITO>after he crashed through the window?

100
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:52,890
<4-6,LANIE>不  这是矿物晶体
<4-6,LANIE>No, these are mineral crystals.

101
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:54,890
<4-6,LANIE>希望实验室能分辨出来
<4-6,LANIE>Hopefully the lab can I.D. them.

102
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,220
<4-7,ESPOSITO>等等  你每次叫我来
<4-7,ESPOSITO>Hang on. You always call me down here

103
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,240
<4-7,ESPOSITO>都是在实验室出结果后
<4-7,ESPOSITO>after the lab results are in,

104
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,490
<4-7,ESPOSITO>所以我认为
<4-7,ESPOSITO>which leads me to believe that you may have

105
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:06,010
<4-7,ESPOSITO>你还有别的动机
<4-7,ESPOSITO>some ulterior motives.

106
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:09,080
<4-8,LANIE>哈维  我有事想要你帮忙
<4-8,LANIE>Javi, I want to ask a little favor.

107
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,620
<4-9,ESPOSITO>你尽管说
<4-9,ESPOSITO>Anything you need.

108
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,480
<4-10,LANIE>我父母几乎从不离开路易斯安那州
<4-10,LANIE>So...My parents barely ever leave Louisiana,

109
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,270
<4-10,LANIE>他们明天要飞巴黎
<4-10,LANIE>and they're flying out to Paris tomorrow,

110
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:19,180
<4-10,LANIE>他们临时要在纽约中转
<4-10,LANIE>and they have a last-minute layover in New York.

111
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:22,290
<4-10,LANIE>他们想一起见个面
<4-10,LANIE>They want us all to get together.

112
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,890
<4-11,ESPOSITO>那么是要...
<4-11,ESPOSITO>So it's, uh,

113
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,910
<4-11,ESPOSITO>见家长吗
<4-11,ESPOSITO>meet the parents?

114
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,710
<4-12,LANIE>你能行吗
<4-12,LANIE>Are you okay with that?

115
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,600
<4-12,LANIE>当然
<4-12,LANIE>Yeah.

116
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,710
<4-13,ESPOSITO>当然  有什么不行的
<4-13,ESPOSITO>Yeah. Why wouldn't I be?

117
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:36,180
<4-13,ESPOSITO>这都不算帮忙  这只是更进一步
<4-13,ESPOSITO>That's not even really a favor. That's just me stepping up.

118
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:42,730
<4-15,LANIE>其实  我还没说到要你帮忙的
<4-15,LANIE>See, I didn't get to the favor part...

119
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:43,890
<4-15,LANIE>部分呢
<4-15,LANIE>...yet.

120
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:45,690
<4-16,ESPOSITO>什么
<4-16,ESPOSITO>What?

121
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:47,980
<4-17,ESPOSITO>刚刚不是吗
<4-17,ESPOSITO>You didn't?

122
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,110
<4-18,LANIE>是这样
<4-18,LANIE>See, um...

123
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,360
<4-18,LANIE>我父母
<4-18,LANIE>My parents...

124
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:55,730
<4-18,LANIE>我父母以为我们订婚了
<4-18,LANIE>My... my parents kind of think we're engaged.

125
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,060
<4-19,ESPOSITO>为什么呢
<4-19,ESPOSITO>Wh-why do they think that?

126
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:00,410
<4-20,LANIE>因为我们分分合合
<4-20,LANIE>Well, you and I were on again, off again,

127
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:01,920
<4-20,LANIE>他们特别担心
<4-20,LANIE>and they just got so worried about

128
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,140
<4-20,LANIE>他们的未婚女儿
<4-20,LANIE>their unmarried daughter that...

129
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,990
<4-21,ESPOSITO>所以你就跟他们说我们订婚了吗
<4-21,ESPOSITO>So you told them we got engaged?

130
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:07,770
<4-22,LANIE>我不是有意的  就那么冲口而出了
<4-22,LANIE>I didn't mean to. It just...Popped out.

131
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:10,000
<4-23,ESPOSITO>这种事怎么能冲口而出啊
<4-23,ESPOSITO>How does something like that just pop out?

132
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,800
<4-24,LANIE>我只想让他们别再纠缠下去
<4-24,LANIE>I wanted them to stop bugging me.

133
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:14,070
<4-24,LANIE>抱歉  哈维  既然我都说了
<4-24,LANIE>I'm sorry, Javi, but once I said it,

134
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:16,200
<4-24,LANIE>也改不了了   现在他们就来了
<4-24,LANIE>there it was, and now here they are.

135
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:18,470
<4-25,ESPOSITO>那么你是叫我第一次见你父母
<4-25,ESPOSITO>So the first time I meet your parents,

136
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:19,980
<4-25,ESPOSITO>就对他们撒谎
<4-25,ESPOSITO>you're asking me to lie to them?

137
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,930
<4-26,LANIE>我也要撒谎  但我早就这样了
<4-26,LANIE>I'll be lying to them, too, but I've been doing it longer.

138
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,670
<4-27,ESPOSITO>我能
<4-27,ESPOSITO>Uh... can I...just...

139
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,060
<4-28,LANIE>带他们来警局跟你打声招呼吗
<4-28,LANIE>bring 'em down to the precinct to say hello?

140
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:35,910
<4-28,LANIE>你就伪装十分钟
<4-28,LANIE>And you could just pretend for 10 minutes.

141
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:38,230
<4-28,LANIE>我会让你值当的
<4-28,LANIE>I'll make it worth your while.

142
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,480
<4-29,ESPOSITO>嗯  没问题  我能做到
<4-29,ESPOSITO>Y-yeah, yeah. I-I can do that.

143
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:45,700
<5-1,BECKETT>我们已经查看了埃里克家史
<5-1,BECKETT>So we looked into Eric's family history,

144
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,730
<5-1,BECKETT>他电话和电脑里的联系人
<5-1,BECKETT>contacts in his phone and computer.

145
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,800
<5-1,BECKETT>他没有一个叫爱德华·梅瑟的叔叔
<5-1,BECKETT>He does not have an uncle named Edward Mercer.

146
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,920
<5-1,BECKETT>事实上  他没有叔叔
<5-1,BECKETT>In fact, he doesn't have an uncle at all.

147
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,210
<5-2,CASTLE>那他为何没去上班  他去哪了
<5-2,CASTLE>Then why did he miss his shift, and where did he go?

148
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:59,180
<5-3,RYAN>我可能知道答案
<5-3,RYAN>I may have an answer to that.

149
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,430
<5-3,RYAN>记录显示埃里克
<5-3,RYAN>It turns out that Eric

150
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:03,280
<5-3,RYAN>今晚用拼车软件搭便车
<5-3,RYAN>used the Hytch Ride Share App to catch a ride

151
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,460
<5-3,RYAN>去了皇后区的某个地方
<5-3,RYAN>to an address in Queens tonight.

152
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,820
<5-3,RYAN>就在他被杀的几小时前
<5-3,RYAN>A couple of hours before he was killed.

153
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:09,440
<5-3,RYAN>实际上  他多次去过那个地方
<5-3,RYAN>In fact, he took numerous trips to that same address

154
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,600
<5-3,RYAN>并都和他医院翘班的时间吻合
<5-3,RYAN>which line up with shifts that he missed at the hospital.

155
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,860
<5-4,BECKETT>那地方有什么
<5-4,BECKETT>And what's at this location?

156
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,500
<5-5,CASTLE>显然没有爱德华叔叔
<5-5,CASTLE>Certainly not uncle edward.

157
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,090
<5-6,RYAN>是一个办公大楼
<5-6,RYAN>Offices. It's an office building

158
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:19,510
<5-6,RYAN>归纽约常青树卫生公司所有
<5-6,RYAN>owned by Evergreen Sanitation N.Y.C.

159
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,810
<5-7,BECKETT>你确定吗
<5-7,BECKETT>Are you sure about that?

160
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,450
<5-8,BECKETT>纽约常青树卫生公司是已知的
<5-8,BECKETT>Evergreen Sanitation N.Y.C. is a known front

161
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,150
<5-8,BECKETT>犯罪集团门面公司
<5-8,BECKETT>for organized crime.

162
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:28,860
<5-9,CASTLE>为什么埃里克·梅瑟要去一个犯罪窝点
<5-9,CASTLE>Why would Eric Mercer be visiting a mob-owned building?

163
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,870
<5-10,BECKETT>我们去皇后区查查就知道了
<5-10,BECKETT>Let's head to Queens and find out.

164
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:34,340
<6-1,BECKETT>没门牌  没有名字
<6-1,BECKETT>No placards, no names.

165
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,430
<6-1,BECKETT>这地方感觉就像个无人区
<6-1,BECKETT>It's like this whole place is unoccupied.

166
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,270
<6-2,CASTLE>埃里克却翘班跑来这里
<6-2,CASTLE>And yet Eric missed work to come here...

167
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,460
<6-2,CASTLE>而且是多次来
<6-2,CASTLE>Repeatedly.

168
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:43,450
<6-4,BECKETT>你好  先生  我们是纽约警局的  你能帮忙
<6-4,BECKETT>Ooh, excuse me, sir, N.Y.P.D. Could you help...

169
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:46,270
<6-5,BECKETT>等等  先生  你能帮个忙吗  我们
<6-5,BECKETT>Wait, sir, could you please just help us? We...

171
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:01,330
<6-5,BECKETT>这是个手术室
<6-5,BECKETT>This is a surgical suite.

172
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:03,810
<7-1,CASTLE>归犯罪集团所有
<7-1,CASTLE>Owned by organized crime.

173
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,430
<7-2,BECKETT>埃里克·梅瑟不是个普通的医生
<7-2,BECKETT>Eric Mercer wasn't just a doctor.

174
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:08,820
<7-3,CASTLE>他是黑帮天使
<7-3,CASTLE>He was a mob doctor.

184
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:18,510
<7-3,CASTLE>我在集团犯罪组工作了16年
<7-3,CASTLE>I've worked organized crime 16 years.

185
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:21,150
<8-1,DETECTIVE MCBRIDE>认识大部分的角色  但这个人  我不认识
<8-1,DETECTIVE MCBRIDE>I know most of the players, but this guy? No.

186
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:24,860
<8-2,BECKETT>我们推测他可能是纽约常青树卫生公司
<8-2,BECKETT>Well, we believe that he might have been a family doctor

187
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:27,710
<8-2,BECKETT>所有者的家庭医生
<8-2,BECKETT>for whoever controls Evergreen Sanitation N.Y.C.

188
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:29,140
<8-3,MCBRIDE>我知道  卡鲁齐家族
<8-3,MCBRIDE>Yeah, that's the Carlucci family.

189
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,410
<8-3,MCBRIDE>自从迪诺·斯卡佩拉掌权后
<8-3,MCBRIDE>They've been moving up the Charts

190
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:32,320
<8-3,MCBRIDE>他们的地位就大大提升
<8-3,MCBRIDE>since Dino Scarpella took over.

191
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,610
<8-3,MCBRIDE>但我不知道他们有个家庭医生
<8-3,MCBRIDE>But I didn't know that they had a doctor.

192
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:36,250
<8-4,CASTLE>迪诺·斯卡佩拉  我认识他
<8-4,CASTLE>Whoa. Um, Dino Scarpella... I know that guy.

193
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:36,910
<8-5,BECKETT>真的吗
<8-5,BECKETT>Seriously?

194
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:39,240
<8-6,CASTLE>嗯  我为德里克·斯道姆小说做调查时找过他
<8-6,CASTLE>Yeah, he helped me with research for a Derrick Storm novel,

195
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,470
<8-6,CASTLE>但他当时就是个中层人物
<8-6,CASTLE>But back then he was just a mid-level guy.

196
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,450
<8-7,BECKETT>麦克布莱德警探  假设埃里克就是
<8-7,BECKETT>Detective McBride, if Eric was a doctor

197
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:45,260
<8-7,BECKETT>卡鲁齐家族的医生  你能想到
<8-7,BECKETT>for the Carlucci family, do you have any idea

198
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,470
<8-7,BECKETT>他为何被杀吗
<8-7,BECKETT>why he would have been targeted?

199
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,490
<8-8,MCBRIDE>我没听到任何风声  如果你是指这个的话
<8-8,MCBRIDE>I haven't heard anything, if that's what you're asking me.

200
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:50,340
<8-8,MCBRIDE>但他被杀的方式
<8-8,MCBRIDE>But, uh, the way he was killed,

201
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,220
<8-8,MCBRIDE>像是有人想传递信息
<8-8,MCBRIDE>sounds like somebody was sending a message.

202
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:53,790
<8-9,CASTLE>我们能在哪找到迪诺·斯卡佩拉
<8-9,CASTLE>Where would we find Dino Scarpella?

203
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,760
<8-10,MCBRIDE>他主要的生意都在皇后区
<8-10,MCBRIDE>Uh, his main offices are over in Queens.

204
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:59,550
<8-10,MCBRIDE>是一家叫燃情的脱衣舞俱乐部
<8-10,MCBRIDE>It's a strip club called Cica Cica Boom Room.

205
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:01,120
<8-11,CASTLE>-为什么问这  -我们应该去跟他谈谈
<8-11,CASTLE>- Why?  - Well, we should go talk to him.

206
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,720
<8-11,CASTLE>迪诺认识我  他喜欢我
<8-11,CASTLE>Dino knows me. He likes me.

207
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,000
<8-11,CASTLE>如果埃里克是黑帮天使的话  他会愿意帮忙的
<8-11,CASTLE>If Eric was his mob doctor, he'd want to help solve this.

208
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,650
<8-12,BECKETT>前提是他没有参与其中
<8-12,BECKETT>Assuming he wasn't involved.

209
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,060
<8-12,BECKETT>我会让莱恩和埃斯波西托警探
<8-12,BECKETT>You know, I'll have detectives Ryan and Esposito

210
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,730
<8-12,BECKETT>与你协调调查野马车和弹道报告
<8-12,BECKETT>coordinate with you on the mustang and ballistics.

211
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:13,840
<8-12,BECKETT>看看能否查到
<8-12,BECKETT>We'll see if any of that connects

212
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,430
<8-12,BECKETT>犯罪集团哪个人身上
<8-12,BECKETT>to anyone in organized crime.

213
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,550
<8-13,CASTLE>脱衣舞俱乐部之旅
<8-13,CASTLE>Field trip to a strip club.

214
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,680
<9-1,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你要再这样看下去
<9-1,BECKETT>Castle, you keep staring like that,

215
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,810
<9-1,BECKETT>你至少得消费两杯酒了
<9-1,BECKETT>you're gonna have to pay for the 2-drink minimum.

216
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,570
<9-2,CASTLE>抱歉  你刚说什么来着
<9-2,CASTLE>I'm sorry. What were you saying?

217
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:40,500
<9-3,BECKETT>我什么都没说  是你在说
<9-3,BECKETT>I wasn't saying anything. You were talking.

218
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,280
<9-3,BECKETT>迪诺的事  说他是个好人
<9-3,BECKETT>About Dino, about how he's a nice guy

219
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,040
<9-3,BECKETT>尽管他是个黑帮头目
<9-3,BECKETT>In spite of the fact that he's a mobster.

220
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,350
<9-4,BECKETT>-你不会吧  -不是
<9-4,BECKETT>- Really? - No. But... uh...

221
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:47,160
<9-5,CASTLE>我知道你很难相信
<9-5,CASTLE>I know you find this hard to believe,

222
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,270
<9-5,CASTLE>但他真是一个很不错的人
<9-5,CASTLE>but he is a really nice guy.

223
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:52,160
<9-6,BECKETT>当然  直到他像杀鱼一样把你宰了
<9-6,BECKETT>Yeah, sure, up until the point he guts you like a fish.

224
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,700
<9-7,DINO SCARPELLA>-里克  真的是你吗  -迪诺
<9-7,DINO SCARPELLA>- Rick, is that really you? - Dino!

<9-20,BECKETT>A, uh, Dr. Eric Mercer.

243
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:44,040
<9-21,DINO>我不认识这个人
<9-21,DINO>Yeah, I do not recognize this person.

244
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:48,390
<9-22,BECKETT>斯卡佩拉先生  我们知道梅瑟医生
<9-22,BECKETT>Mr. Scarpella, we've connected Dr. Mercer

245
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:51,560
<9-22,BECKETT>在一间你的机构出资的手术室工作
<9-22,BECKETT>to a surgical suite paid for by your organization.

246
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,660
<9-23,CASTLE>迪诺  我们知道埃里克为你工作
<9-23,CASTLE>Dino, we know Eric worked for you,

247
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,400
<9-23,CASTLE>但有谁会想杀他呢
<9-23,CASTLE>But who would want to do this to him?

248
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,450
<9-23,CASTLE>你能帮帮我们吗
<9-23,CASTLE>Can you help us out?

249
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:58,550
<9-24,DINO>很遗憾  我无能为力
<9-24,DINO>Sadly, I have no help to offer.

250
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:00,790
<9-24,DINO>但请留下来  好好玩玩
<9-24,DINO>But please, stay, enjoy yourselves.

251
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:02,010
<9-24,DINO>我请客
<9-24,DINO>It's on the house.

252
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,290
<9-25,BECKETT>斯卡佩拉先生
<9-25,BECKETT>Uh, Mr. Scarpella...

253
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:06,620
<9-26,CHRISTOPHER>他说了  我们帮不上忙
<9-26,CHRISTOPHER>Like he said, we got nothing for you.

254
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:14,940
<9-27,BECKETT>-喂  埃斯波  -你和卡塞尔在欣赏脱衣舞时
<9-27,BECKETT>- Hey, Espo.  - So while you and Castle were busy getting lap dances,

255
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,720
<9-28,ESPOSITO>莱恩和我却在努力办案
<9-28,ESPOSITO>Ryan and I did some real police work.

256
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:18,950
<9-28,ESPOSITO>我们发现了卡鲁齐家族与凶案的联系
<9-28,ESPOSITO>We found a Carlucci connection to the murder.

257
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:20,850
<9-29,BECKETT>等等  什么联系
<9-29,BECKETT>Yeah... wait, what kind of a connection?

258
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,200
<9-30,RYAN>家族的二号人物
<9-30,RYAN>Turns out the family's number two,

259
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,250
<9-30,RYAN>克里斯托弗·卡鲁齐有一辆黑色野马
<9-30,RYAN>Christopher Carlucci, owns a black mustang.

260
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,160
<9-30,RYAN>猜猜里面藏了什么
<9-30,RYAN>Guess what was stashed inside.

261
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:30,090
<9-30,RYAN>一件带血迹的圣诞老人服
<9-30,RYAN>A santa suit... With blood on it.

262
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,400
<9-31,BECKETT>克里斯托弗·卡鲁齐
<9-31,BECKETT>Christopher Carlucci,

263
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:34,950
<9-31,BECKETT>我们得谈谈
<9-31,BECKETT>We need to talk.

264
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:37,580
<10-1,BECKETT>你为何要杀埃里克·梅瑟
<10-1,BECKETT>Why did you kill Eric Mercer?

265
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:38,930
<10-2,CHRISTOPHER>我没有
<10-2,CHRISTOPHER>I didn't.

266
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,040
<10-3,BECKETT>行  那你给我解释一下
<10-3,BECKETT>Okay, then why don't you clear this up for me?

267
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:43,320
<10-3,BECKETT>案发时你在哪里
<10-3,BECKETT>Where were you at the time of the murder?

268
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,670
<10-3,BECKETT>怎么会有人在犯罪现场看到了你的野马
<10-3,BECKETT>And why did witnesses see your mustang at the crime scene?

269
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:49,250
<10-3,BECKETT>我们又怎么会在你的后车箱
<10-3,BECKETT>And why did we find a santa suit

270
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:52,320
<10-3,BECKETT>找到了一套沾有埃里克血迹的圣诞老人衣服
<10-3,BECKETT>stuffed in the trunk of your car with Eric's blood on it?

271
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:58,450
<10-4,BECKETT>听着  克里斯托弗  我并不认为你是某天醒来
<10-4,BECKETT>Look, Christopher, I don't think you just woke up one morning

272
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,290
<10-4,BECKETT>突然就决定要杀了家庭医生
<10-4,BECKETT>and decided to kill the family doctor.

273
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:02,270
<10-4,BECKETT>应该是上面下的命令吧
<10-4,BECKETT>That kind of order comes from above.

274
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:07,110
<10-4,BECKETT>是迪诺·斯卡佩拉下的命令吗
<10-4,BECKETT>Did Dino Scarpella give the order?

275
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,750
<10-5,CHRISTOPHER>我要找律师
<10-5,CHRISTOPHER>I want a lawyer.

276
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:19,920
<11-1,RYAN>搞不懂卡鲁齐家的人为什么要杀了他们的医生
<11-1,RYAN>I wonder why the Carluccis would kill their own doctor.

277
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,250
<11-1,RYAN>也许他看到了什么不该看的东西
<11-1,RYAN>Maybe he saw something he shouldn't have,

278
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,170
<11-2,CASTLE>或是没能救活某个重要的帮派人物
<11-2,CASTLE>let the wrong mobster die on his table.

279
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:25,010
<11-3,RYAN>也对
<11-3,RYAN>Yeah.

280
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:26,710
<11-4,CASTLE>-失陪  -嗯
<11-4,CASTLE>- Excuse me. - Yeah.

281
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:30,090
<11-6,CASTLE>理查德·卡塞尔
<11-6,CASTLE>Richard Castle.

282
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:33,120
<11-7,DINO>里克  我们得谈谈
<11-7,DINO>Rick, we need to talk.

283
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:37,900
<11-7,DINO>他想让你去脱衣舞俱乐部见他
<11-7,DINO>He said he wanted you to meet him at the strip club?

284
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:38,850
<12-1,BECKETT>为什么
<12-1,BECKETT>Why?

285
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:40,640
<12-2,CASTLE>他只说事情很紧急
<12-2,CASTLE>He just said that it was urgent.

286
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,070
<12-2,CASTLE>要是迪诺·斯卡佩拉发出邀请
<12-2,CASTLE>And when Dino Scarpella issues an invitation,

287
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,540
<12-2,CASTLE>你可不能用"不"来答复他
<12-2,CASTLE>You don't R.S.V.P. with "No."

288
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:47,550
<12-3,BECKETT>当然可以  尤其是他可能下令杀了埃里克·梅瑟
<12-3,BECKETT>Yeah, you do, especially if he put a hit out on Eric Mercer.

289
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:49,020
<12-4,CASTLE>他打到分局来找我
<12-4,CASTLE>He called me at the precinct.

290
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,620
<12-4,CASTLE>他知道我娶了你
<12-4,CASTLE>He knows I'm married to you.

291
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,300
<12-4,CASTLE>我不会有危险的
<12-4,CASTLE>I-I'm in no danger here.

292
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,980
<12-5,BECKETT>天啊  卡塞尔  这话听着像墓志铭一样
<12-5,BECKETT>Oh, God, Castle, this just sounds like an epitaph.

293
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,280
<12-5,BECKETT>这样吧  我跟你一起去
<12-5,BECKETT>Um...You know what? I'm gonna go with you.

294
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,250
<12-6,CASTLE>他说了让我一个人去
<12-6,CASTLE>He said to come alone.

295
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,490
<12-6,CASTLE>这次你得相信我
<12-6,CASTLE>You're gonna have to trust me on this.

296
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:04,970
<12-6,CASTLE>迪诺  他是个有操守的人
<12-6,CASTLE>Dino... He's an honorable man.

297
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,850
<12-7,BECKETT>好吧  埃里克肯定也是这么想的
<12-7,BECKETT>Yeah, well, I bet that's what Eric thought, too.

298
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:16,510
<13-1,DINO>自己去买点好东西  好吗
<13-1,DINO>Buy yourself something nice with it, okay?

299
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,940
<13-1,DINO>别老想着这场悲剧了
<13-1,DINO>Take your mind off this tragedy.

300
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:21,440
<13-1,DINO>别告诉你母亲  好吗
<13-1,DINO>And don't tell your mother, okay?

301
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,580
<13-2,JANE>谢谢  爸爸
<13-2,JANE>Thanks, daddy.

302
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:26,690
<13-2,JANE>简
<13-2,JANE>Jane.

303
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,930
<13-3,DINO>她花在衣服上的钱
<13-3,DINO>The roll of cash she spends on clothes

304
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:30,350
<13-3,DINO>都能撑死一匹马了
<13-3,DINO>could choke a horse.

305
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:32,640
<13-3,DINO>我甚至买下了一家山寨的名牌服饰店
<13-3,DINO>I even bought an imitation couture company,

306
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,980
<13-3,DINO>但假货可配不上我女儿
<13-3,DINO>but the fake stuff isn't good enough for my girl.

307
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,080
<13-3,DINO>对吧  尤其她现在还很伤心
<13-3,DINO>Right? Especially now that she's upset.

308
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,250
<13-3,DINO>她跟埃里克  他们非常亲近
<13-3,DINO>She and Eric -- they were very close,

309
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,790
<13-3,DINO>从小就非常亲近了
<13-3,DINO>very close since they were kids.

310
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,590
<13-4,CASTLE>那么你承认他是你的医生了
<13-4,CASTLE>So you're admitting he was your doctor.

311
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:46,240
<13-5,DINO>我不喜欢"承认"这个词
<13-5,DINO>I don't like that word "Admit."

312
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,830
<13-6,CASTLE>那就"确认"
<13-6,CASTLE>"Acknowledging"?

313
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:51,220
<13-7,DINO>里克  你和我
<13-7,DINO>Wow, Rick, me and you --

314
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:54,130
<13-7,DINO>我们以前关系不错  对吧
<13-7,DINO>We had a good relationship once, huh?

315
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,010
<13-8,CASTLE>现在也是啊  不是吗
<13-8,CASTLE>We still do, don't we?

316
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:56,900
<13-8,CASTLE>我不知道
<13-8,CASTLE>Well, I don't know. I --

317
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,900
<13-9,DINO>我得确认说话不用有顾忌
<13-9,DINO>I need to know I can speak freely.

318
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,550
<13-9,DINO>得确认你不会转身就去对警方
<13-9,DINO>That you're not gonna turn around and repeat

319
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:02,170
<13-9,DINO>重复我说的话
<13-9,DINO>what I say to the authorities.

320
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,140
<13-9,DINO>迪诺
<13-9,DINO>Dino...

321
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,650
<13-10,CASTLE>你可以相信我
<13-10,CASTLE>You can trust me.

322
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:10,830
<13-10,CASTLE>埃里克是家人
<13-10,CASTLE>Eric was family.

323
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,090
<13-11,DINO>是我表亲布鲁诺的孩子
<13-11,DINO>My cousin Bruno's kid,

324
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,860
<13-11,DINO>他跟第三者生的
<13-11,DINO>By a girl he had on the side.

325
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:19,550
<13-11,DINO>他死在了监狱里
<13-11,DINO>Bruno... he died in the slammer,

326
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,670
<13-11,DINO>于是我一直照看着埃里克
<13-11,DINO>So I looked after Eric.

327
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,590
<13-11,DINO>我送他上最好的学校
<13-11,DINO>I sent him to the best schools.

328
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,750
<13-11,DINO>我不想让他为家族工作  可是...
<13-11,DINO>I didn't want him to work for the family, but...

329
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:28,410
<13-11,DINO>要想听上帝发笑  你就
<13-11,DINO>If you want to hear god laugh, you tell him --

330
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:30,240
<13-11,DINO>就把你的计划告诉他  等他作弄你
<13-11,DINO>Tell him all your plans, right?

331
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:31,620
<13-12,CASTLE>那么到底发生了什么
<13-12,CASTLE>So what happened?

332
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,420
<13-13,DINO>几年前
<13-13,DINO>A few years back,

333
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,560
<13-13,DINO>我的一个手下中了枪  这种事时有发生
<13-13,DINO>One of my guys got shot. It happens.

334
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,680
<13-13,DINO>他本来会死的  可埃里克站了出来
<13-13,DINO>He would have croaked, but Eric stepped up.

335
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,870
<13-13,DINO>接下来
<13-13,DINO>Next thing I know...

336
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,110
<13-13,DINO>他就喜欢上了这样的生活
<13-13,DINO>Next thing I know, he's got a taste for the life.

337
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,400
<13-13,DINO>我必须查清楚是谁干的
<13-13,DINO>I need to find out who did this to him.

338
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:47,970
<13-14,CASTLE>别误会啊  迪诺
<13-14,CASTLE>Don't take this the wrong way, Dino,

339
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:49,240
<13-14,CASTLE>可我觉得你已经知道是谁了
<13-14,CASTLE>But I think you already do know.

340
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,240
<13-15,DINO>不是克里斯托弗
<13-15,DINO>It was not Christopher.

341
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,790
<13-16,CASTLE>-一切证据都表明是他  -他是被陷害的
<13-16,CASTLE>- All the evidence says that it was. - He was framed.

342
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,540
<13-17,DINO>他是清白的  至少在这件事上是
<13-17,DINO>He's innocent -- when it comes to this, anyway.

343
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:58,860
<13-17,DINO>我知道  因为我当时跟他在一起
<13-17,DINO>I know... Because I was with him.

344
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:00,500
<13-18,CASTLE>迪诺  如果情况属实
<13-18,CASTLE>Dino, if that's true,

345
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:01,700
<13-18,CASTLE>你只要给贝克特打个电话就行
<13-18,CASTLE>all we have to do is call Beckett.

346
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,900
<13-18,CASTLE>-你可以做他的不在场证明  -不  不行
<13-18,CASTLE>- You can alibi him. Mm, no, that's no good.

347
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,510
<13-19,DINO>要知道  当时我跟克里斯托弗
<13-19,DINO>See, at the time, me and Christopher, we were,

348
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:09,300
<13-19,DINO>我们在进行一项很敏感的商业交易
<13-19,DINO>Uh, engaged in a sensitive business transaction.

349
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:11,280
<13-20,CASTLE>你说的"敏感"  是指"非法"吧
<13-20,CASTLE>And by "Sensitive," You mean "Illegal."

350
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:12,800
<13-20,CASTLE>这词我也不喜欢
<13-20,CASTLE>I don't like that word either.

351
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:14,600
<13-21,DINO>我的重点是
<13-21,DINO>My point is this --

352
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:17,230
<13-21,DINO>警察没在追查杀埃里克的真凶
<13-21,DINO>The cops are not looking for Eric's killer

353
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:19,230
<13-21,DINO>因为他们以为自己已经抓到真凶了
<13-21,DINO>because they think they already got him.

354
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:20,530
<13-21,DINO>就算他们去找
<13-21,DINO>Even if they are out looking for him,

355
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:22,870
<13-21,DINO>我的人也不会给乖乖配合
<13-21,DINO>Nobody in my world's gonna give 'em the time of day.

356
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,640
<13-21,DINO>所以就需要你出马了
<13-21,DINO>And this is where you come in.

357
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:26,510
<13-22,CASTLE>-我  -对
<13-22,CASTLE>- Me? - Yeah.

358
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:28,570
<13-23,DINO>我要你证明克里斯托弗的清白
<13-23,DINO>I need you to prove Christopher's innocence

359
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,090
<13-23,DINO>并找出杀死埃里克的真凶
<13-23,DINO>and find Eric's killer.

360
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:33,260
<13-23,DINO>你看  与这事相关的人肯定不会跟警察合作
<13-23,DINO>See, nobody connected's gonna talk to the cops,

361
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:34,900
<13-23,DINO>但如果我替你作保
<13-23,DINO>But if I vouch for you,

362
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:38,410
<13-23,DINO>给你一些警察得不到的权限
<13-23,DINO>give you access no cop has ever gotten...

363
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,310
<13-24,CASTLE>迪诺  我不知道自己...
<13-24,CASTLE>Dino, I don't know if I'm --

364
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:41,970
<13-25,DINO>我可以开个玩笑  说要给你一份
<13-25,DINO>I could crack a joke about making you an offer

365
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:43,340
<13-25,DINO>你无法拒绝的邀约
<13-25,DINO>you can't refuse.

366
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:46,100
<13-25,DINO>但你一定不能拒绝
<13-25,DINO>But you cannot refuse.

367
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:48,660
<13-26,CASTLE>明白
<13-26,CASTLE>Understood.

368
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,770
<13-27,DINO>那就好
<13-27,DINO>Good.

369
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,590
<13-28,CASTLE>但我如果查出是谁干的
<13-28,CASTLE>But if I figure out who did this,

370
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:54,850
<13-28,CASTLE>你得让我把凶手缉拿归案
<13-28,CASTLE>you have to let me bring the killer to justice.

371
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:57,480
<13-28,CASTLE>我是指上公堂
<13-28,CASTLE>And by "Justice," I mean legal justice,

372
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,510
<13-28,CASTLE>不是直接灭了他
<13-28,CASTLE>not just taking him out.

373
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:01,190
<13-28,CASTLE>到时候我要打电话通知贝克特
<13-28,CASTLE>When the time comes, I need to call Beckett.

374
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,670
<13-29,DINO>我们要用缄默法则起誓
<13-29,DINO>We will swear by the code of silence.

375
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,260
<13-29,DINO>乌黙它
<13-29,DINO>Omerta?

377
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,990
<13-30,CASTLE>你现在也跟我们血脉相连了  里克
<13-30,CASTLE>You're blood now, Rick.

378
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,390
<13-32,CASTLE>你也是我们的家人了
<13-32,CASTLE>You're family.

379
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:25,600
<13-33,DINO>别让我失望
<13-33,DINO>Do not let me down.

380
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:29,560
<14-1,BECKETT>我整理一下
<14-1,BECKETT>So let me get this straight.

381
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,100
<14-1,BECKETT>你想代表你的黑帮老大朋友
<14-1,BECKETT>You want to reinvestigate Eric's murder

382
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:36,070
<14-1,BECKETT>重新调查埃里克的谋杀案
<14-1,BECKETT>on behalf of your friend dino the mob boss?

383
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:38,340
<14-2,CASTLE>好吧  你这么说听起来可挺糟的
<14-2,CASTLE>Okay, well, when you put it like that, it sounds bad.

384
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,810
<14-3,BECKETT>不管我怎么说都挺糟的
<14-3,BECKETT>It sounds bad no matter how I put it.

385
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:42,120
<14-3,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我们已经抓到凶手了
<14-3,BECKETT>Castle, we have the killer.

386
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,940
<14-4,CASTLE>克里斯托弗当时跟迪诺在一起
<14-4,CASTLE>Christopher was with Dino at the time.

387
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,520
<14-5,BECKETT>那只是迪诺说的
<14-5,BECKETT>According to Dino.

388
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,050
<14-5,BECKETT>迪诺在耍你
<14-5,BECKETT>Dino is playing you.

389
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,000
<14-6,CASTLE>时常有帮派成员被捕
<14-6,CASTLE>Mobsters get arrested.

390
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,220
<14-6,CASTLE>这是做生意的成本  迪诺清楚这点
<14-6,CASTLE>It's a cost of doing business. Dino knows that.

391
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,760
<14-6,CASTLE>所以克里斯托弗要不是真的清白
<14-6,CASTLE>So why go through the trouble of asking me to look into it

392
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,360
<14-6,CASTLE>他为什么还要大费周章请我去调查
<14-6,CASTLE>unless Christopher was innocent?

393
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,760
<14-7,BECKETT>首先  他那可不叫"请"
<14-7,BECKETT>Firstly, he didn't exactly ask you,

394
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,980
<14-7,BECKETT>其次  他只是想让自己的二把手回到身边
<14-7,BECKETT>and secondly, he just wants his number two back.

395
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,560
<14-8,CASTLE>其实不只这些
<14-8,CASTLE>Well, there's more to it than that.

396
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:04,650
<14-8,CASTLE>乌黙它
<14-8,CASTLE>Omerta.

397
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:06,560
<14-8,CASTLE>我们发了血誓
<14-8,CASTLE>We made the blood oath.

398
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,380
<14-8,CASTLE>不是我的主意  我也没别的选择
<14-8,CASTLE>It was not my idea, and I did not have a choice.

399
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:12,590
<14-9,BECKETT>你相信迪诺就是因为被他取了点血
<14-9,BECKETT>So you believe Dino because he gave you a paper cut?

400
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:15,290
<14-10,CASTLE>如果我调查埃里克被杀案
<14-10,CASTLE>Look, if I look into eric's murder

401
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:18,490
<14-10,CASTLE>发现凶手还是克里斯托弗·卡鲁齐  那就是他
<14-10,CASTLE>and the trail leads back to Christopher Carlucci, so be it.

402
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:19,910
<14-10,CASTLE>但如果并非如此
<14-10,CASTLE>But if it doesn't,

403
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,760
<14-10,CASTLE>难道你不想知道真凶是谁吗
<14-10,CASTLE>don't you want to know who the real killer is?

404
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:27,290
<14-10,CASTLE>好吧
<14-10,CASTLE>Fine.

405
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:28,610
<14-11,BECKETT>但是你得保证不让盖茨警监
<14-11,BECKETT>But you have to promise that Captain Gates

406
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:30,280
<14-11,BECKETT>发现我们在调查
<14-11,BECKETT>isn't gonna find out that we're poking around

407
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,480
<14-11,BECKETT>已经结了的案子
<14-11,BECKETT>an already closed case.

408
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,860
<14-11,BECKETT>而且  你必须随时向我
<14-11,BECKETT>And... you have to keep me looped in

409
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,890
<14-11,BECKETT>-汇报新情况  -我保证
<14-11,BECKETT>- every step of the way. - I promise.

410
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,330
<14-12,CASTLE>既然迪诺给了我在家族中任意查访的权利
<14-12,CASTLE>And since Dino gave me an all-access pass with the family,

411
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,210
<14-12,CASTLE>我就从克里斯托弗问起吧
<14-12,CASTLE>I'm gonna start by talking to Christopher.

412
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,380
<14-12,CASTLE>谢谢
<14-12,CASTLE>Thank you.

413
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,180
<15-1,RYAN>我听说迪诺·斯卡佩拉和卡塞尔见了面
<15-1,RYAN>I heard Dino Scarpella and Castle had a sit-down.

414
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,470
<15-1,RYAN>你觉得是为什么
<15-1,RYAN>What do you think that's about?

415
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,510
<15-1,RYAN>不知道
<15-1,RYAN>I don't know.

416
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:52,810
<15-2,ESPOSITO>但我讨厌他有事瞒着我们的情况
<15-2,ESPOSITO>But I don't like him going around us like this.

417
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:54,190
<15-3,LANIE>嗨  宝贝

<16-3,CASTLE>有谁会想陷害你
<16-3,CASTLE>So who'd want to frame you?

464
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,930
<16-4,CHRISTOPHER>我是他的得力助手
<16-4,CHRISTOPHER>I'm his right-hand man.

465
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:54,290
<16-4,CHRISTOPHER>我能说出50个等不及想
<16-4,CHRISTOPHER>I know 50 guys who would slit my throat...

466
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,290
<16-4,CHRISTOPHER>干掉我的人
<16-4,CHRISTOPHER>like that.

467
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:57,350
<16-4,CHRISTOPHER>但他们会直接动手
<16-4,CHRISTOPHER>But they'd kill me.

468
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:59,890
<16-4,CHRISTOPHER>不会有想陷害我的人
<16-4,CHRISTOPHER>Not one of 'em would frame me.

469
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,720
<16-5,CASTLE>好吧  那说说埃里克吧
<16-5,CASTLE>All right, then let's talk about Eric.

470
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:06,760
<16-6,CHRISTOPHER>埃里克  最近有点担心
<16-6,CHRISTOPHER>Eric, uh, recently had some concerns.

471
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:09,320
<16-7,CASTLE>担心有人要杀他吗
<16-7,CASTLE>Concerns that someone was after him?

472
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:11,060
<16-8,CHRISTOPHER>也不是
<16-8,CHRISTOPHER>Not exactly. Uh...

473
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:14,120
<16-8,CHRISTOPHER>埃里克作为我们的医生
<16-8,CHRISTOPHER>See, Eric being our doctor --

474
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:15,930
<16-8,CHRISTOPHER>这是我们的家族秘密
<16-8,CHRISTOPHER>we kept that secret.

475
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:18,320
<16-8,CHRISTOPHER>以便他能继续无关家族那部分的生活
<16-8,CHRISTOPHER>You know, so he could have a life outside the family.

476
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:21,670
<16-8,CHRISTOPHER>但我猜他是担心这个秘密泄露
<16-8,CHRISTOPHER>But I guess he was afraid that his secret got out,

477
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:24,090
<16-8,CHRISTOPHER>因为几天前  他来找我
<16-8,CHRISTOPHER>because a few days ago, he comes to me

478
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:26,170
<16-8,CHRISTOPHER>让我帮他个忙
<16-8,CHRISTOPHER>and he asks a favor.

479
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,940
<16-9,CASTLE>帮什么忙
<16-9,CASTLE>What kind of a favor?

480
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:30,600
<16-10,CHRISTOPHER>他想要手机窃听检测器
<16-10,CHRISTOPHER>He wanted phone tap detectors.

481
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:32,760
<16-10,CHRISTOPHER>追踪设备
<16-10,CHRISTOPHER>You know, tracing equipment.

482
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,610
<16-10,CHRISTOPHER>他觉得自己在被监视
<16-10,CHRISTOPHER>He thought he was being watched.

483
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:36,250
<16-11,CASTLE>-谁在监视他  -我不知道
<16-11,CASTLE>- By whom? - I don't know.

484
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,590
<16-12,CHRISTOPHER>那时我以为他只是太多疑了
<16-12,CHRISTOPHER>You know, at the time, I thought he was just being paranoid.

485
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:41,750
<16-12,CHRISTOPHER>但我为了以防万一  所以
<16-12,CHRISTOPHER>But I wanted to be safe, so, I, uh,

486
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:45,080
<16-12,CHRISTOPHER>还是帮他联系了网络高手丽塔
<16-12,CHRISTOPHER>I hooked him up with cyber Rita.

487
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:47,810
<17-1,RITA>你们几个白痴准备好了吗
<17-1,RITA>Are you morons ready?

488
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:51,470
<17-1,RITA>我要切断警报器了  3  2  1
<17-1,RITA>I'm cutting the alarm in 3, 2, 1...

489
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,920
<17-1,RITA>结束
<17-1,RITA>bam!

490
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,180
<17-1,RITA>是  我帮了医生
<17-1,RITA>Yeah, I helped the doc.

491
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:57,650
<17-2,CASTLE>埃里克有告诉你他觉得是谁在监视他吗
<17-2,CASTLE>Well, did Eric tell you who he thought was watching him?

492
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,130
<17-3,RITA>你在说什么啊
<17-3,RITA>What are you talking about?

493
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:01,300
<17-4,CASTLE>他问你要反追踪设备时
<17-4,CASTLE>When he asked for the counter surveillance equipment.

494
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,950
<17-5,RITA>他问我要的不是那个
<17-5,RITA>That's not what he asked me for.

495
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:05,630
<17-6,CASTLE>不是吗
<17-6,CASTLE>It isn't?

496
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,290
<17-7,RITA>不  克里斯托弗打给我说埃里克要什么
<17-7,RITA>No. Christopher called me and told me to give Eric

497
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,450
<17-7,RITA>就给什么  所以我就给了
<17-7,RITA>whatever he needed, so I did.

498
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,930
<17-8,CASTLE>埃里克要的是什么
<17-8,CASTLE>And what did Eric need?

499
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,680
<17-8,CASTLE>听起来好像是
<17-8,CASTLE>Well, it sounds like

500
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:16,450
<17-9,RITA>埃里克跟我和克里斯托弗说的不一样呢
<17-9,RITA>Eric told Christopher one thing, and me another.

501
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:18,490
<17-9,RITA>所以在我确保这位打手大哥
<17-9,RITA>So I'm not gonna say another word

502
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,050
<17-9,RITA>不会把我丢进河里喂鱼前
<17-9,RITA>until I'm sure that lurch over there

503
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:22,560
<17-9,RITA>我不打算再说什么了
<17-9,RITA>isn't gonna have me sleeping with the fishes.

504
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:24,120
<17-10,CASTLE>打手  你能不能
<17-10,CASTLE>Uh, lurch, would you --

505
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:26,140
<17-10,CASTLE>我是说  瑞克  你能不能
<17-10,CASTLE>Rocco, I mean, could you --

506
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:29,750
<17-11,RITA>他想要烫手信用卡
<17-11,RITA>He wanted hot credit cards.

507
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,190
<17-12,CASTLE>失窃信用卡  为什么呢
<17-12,CASTLE>Stolen credit cards? What for?

508
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,390
<17-13,RITA>为了不花自己的钱买东西
<17-13,RITA>So he could buy things and not have to pay for them.

509
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,820
<17-14,CASTLE>-谢谢  这...  -我给了他一打
<17-14,CASTLE>- Thank you. That's -- - I gave him a dozen,

510
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:38,880
<17-15,RITA>每张刷爆前差不多
<17-15,RITA>So each is good for about 2 grand

511
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:40,120
<17-15,RITA>能刷两千
<17-15,RITA>before it needs to be tossed.

512
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:42,260
<17-16,CASTLE>埃里克有没有说为什么需要两万四千美金
<17-16,CASTLE>Did Eric say why he needed $24,000?

513
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:44,030
<17-17,RITA>也许是为了租车
<17-17,RITA>Maybe for wheels?

514
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,760
<17-17,RITA>他问我说这卡能不能
<17-17,RITA>He asked if he could use the card to access

515
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:47,470
<17-17,RITA>用在刷卡付钱的租车行  但我跟他说
<17-17,RITA>a swipe-and-go car rental, but I told him

516
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,870
<17-17,RITA>要在租车行用一定要再办张假身份证才行
<17-17,RITA>he was definitely gonna need a fake I.D. to go with the card.

517
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,940
<17-18,CASTLE>你能把那些信用卡号给我发到邮箱里吗
<17-18,CASTLE>Okay, could you e-mail me those credit card numbers

518
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,630
<17-18,CASTLE>-以便我检查一下他有没有用  -好
<17-18,CASTLE>- so I can see if he used them? - Yeah.

519
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,480
<17-19,RITA>你们哪个白痴碰响了防盗门
<17-19,RITA>Which of you idiots just triggered the security door?

520
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:00,320
<18-1,BECKETT>失窃信用卡  可能还有逃亡用车
<18-1,BECKETT>Stolen credit cards, a possible getaway car.

521
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:02,300
<18-1,BECKETT>听起来埃里克好像是要跑路啊
<18-1,BECKETT>Sounds like eric was about to go on the run.

522
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:03,570
<18-2,CASTLE>只是被凶手抢了先
<18-2,CASTLE>Only the killer got to him first.

523
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:06,500
<18-3,BECKETT>如果不是克里斯托弗杀的  那凶手是谁
<18-3,BECKETT>Okay, so if Christopher didn't kill him, then who did?

524
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:09,350
<18-4,CASTLE>也许埃里克用卡买的东西能提供一些线索
<18-4,CASTLE>Maybe whatever Eric was charging on those cards could give us a lead.

525
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,690
<18-5,RYAN>不幸的是  信用卡这条线没戏
<18-5,RYAN>Unfortunately, cards are a bust.

526
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,990
<18-5,RYAN>我查了所有的卡号  最近都没有被使用
<18-5,RYAN>I ran the numbers. No recent activity.

527
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,550
<18-6,CASTLE>-我们找到这些卡了吗  -没
<18-6,CASTLE>- Did we ever find those cards? - Uh, no.

528
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,520
<18-7,RYAN>医院的柜子  他的公寓
<18-7,RYAN>Not in his hospital locker or his apartment

529
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:19,850
<18-8,BECKETT>-他身上都没有  -有可能凶手拿走了
<18-8,BECKETT>- or on his body. - Maybe the killer took them.

530
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,830
<18-9,RYAN>我会让托瑞监控那些信用卡号
<18-9,RYAN>Well, I'll have Tory monitor the numbers,

531
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,060
<18-9,RYAN>看它们有没有人使用
<18-9,RYAN>see if any activity pops.

532
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,970
<18-10,ESPOSITO>-我想我有条线索  -我们真的认为
<18-10,ESPOSITO>- Think I got a lead. - So we're really thinking

533
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:27,820
<18-11,RYAN>-凶手不是克里斯托弗·卡鲁齐对吗  -他不是
<18-11,RYAN>- that this killer is not Christopher Carlucci, right? Yes.

534
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:29,390
<18-13,BECKETT>-有可能不是  -不是吗
<18-13,BECKETT>- Maybe. - No.

535
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:32,290
<18-14,ESPOSITO>算了吧  那家伙有罪
<18-14,ESPOSITO>Oh, come on. The guy is guilty.

536
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,530
<18-14,ESPOSITO>没人会想到他不是凶手  直到卡塞尔
<18-14,ESPOSITO>Nobody thought otherwise until Castle over here

537
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,690
<18-14,ESPOSITO>开始兼职给那伙人打工
<18-14,ESPOSITO>started moonlighting for the mob.

538
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,490
<18-15,CASTLE>我觉得你说的有点过了
<18-15,CASTLE>I think that might be overstating it a little.

539
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,860
<18-16,ESPOSITO>你和他们歃血为盟了都
<18-16,ESPOSITO>You took a blood oath.

540
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:41,540
<18-16,ESPOSITO>你让他们把你变成了个名誉匪徒
<18-16,ESPOSITO>You let them turn you into an honorary mobster.

541
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,220
<18-17,RYAN>-你怎么回事  -行了吧  哥们
<18-17,RYAN>- What's wrong with you? - Oh, come on, man.

542
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:45,710
<18-17,RYAN>有多少黑手党以外的人
<18-17,RYAN>How many people outside of the mafia

543
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,540
<18-17,RYAN>能有机会以沉默法则宣誓
<18-17,RYAN>ever get to swear Omertà?

544
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:49,810
<18-17,RYAN>我觉得这是一次人生的难以忘怀的经历
<18-17,RYAN>I think it is a... experience of a lifetime.

545
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:52,400
<18-19,BECKETT>-你当然这么想  -不是说你有线索吗
<18-19,BECKETT>- Of course you would. - Didn't you say you had a lead?

546
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:54,840
<18-20,ESPOSITO>实验室识别出了蕾妮在埃里克袖子上
<18-20,ESPOSITO>Yeah. The lab was able to identify the crystals

547
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:56,500
<18-20,ESPOSITO>找到的晶体是什么
<18-20,ESPOSITO>that Lanie found on Eric's sleeves.

548
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:58,300
<18-20,ESPOSITO>那是由亚铁氰化钠
<18-20,ESPOSITO>They're made up of sodium ferrocyanide

549
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:00,260
<18-20,ESPOSITO>和氯化钠混合而成的  也就是说
<18-20,ESPOSITO>mixed with sodium chloride, which means --

550
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:03,250
<18-21,CASTLE>那是道路用盐  可好几周都没下过雪了
<18-21,CASTLE>It's road salt. It hasn't snowed in weeks.

551
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,960
<18-21,CASTLE>那为什么埃里克要忙于这件事呢
<18-21,CASTLE>So why would Eric be literally up to his elbows in salt?

552
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:08,430
<18-22,ESPOSITO>我也不清楚  但岛上只有四个盐仓
<18-22,ESPOSITO>I don't know. But there are only four salt depots

553
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,270
<18-22,ESPOSITO>其中一个恰好就在犯罪现场
<18-22,ESPOSITO>on the island, and one of them happens to be

554
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,450
<18-22,ESPOSITO>三个街区的范围内
<18-22,ESPOSITO>within three blocks of our crime scene.

555
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:15,340
<18-24,RYAN>-那个蓝色背包  -我们找了但没找到
<18-24,RYAN>- The blue backpack. But we searched for it. - We never found it.

556
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:18,050
<18-25,BECKETT>那是因为埃里克死前把包藏起来了
<18-25,BECKETT>That's because just before Eric died, he hid that bag.

557
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:19,490
<18-26,CASTLE>那个盐仓
<18-26,CASTLE>The salt depot.

558
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,470
<19-1,CASTLE>天  我们跟随线索找到各种地方
<19-1,CASTLE>Man, the places we go to follow a lead.

559
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,940
<19-1,CASTLE>但如果这帮我们找到凶手  也是值得的
<19-1,CASTLE>But if it points to our killer, it's worth it indeed.

560
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,660
<19-2,BECKETT>你要是想借此帮我写诗
<19-2,BECKETT>If that's you trying to help me with my poem,

561
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:31,200
<19-2,BECKETT>那可是一点用都没有
<19-2,BECKETT>then it's not working.

562
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,440
<19-3,BECKETT>就在这
<19-3,BECKETT>Right over here.

563
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:37,030
<19-3,BECKETT>这就是埃里克进入仓库的地方
<19-3,BECKETT>This is where Eric gained access.

564
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,660
<19-4,CASTLE>等一下  那是  就在那
<19-4,CASTLE>Wait, is that the, uh -- right there.

565
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:50,900
<19-5,CASTLE>被害人的蓝色背包  你说得对
<19-5,CASTLE>The victim's blue backpack. You were right.

566
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:53,060
<19-5,CASTLE>埃里克肯定是在被杀害前把它藏在这里
<19-5,CASTLE>Eric must have stashed it here before he was killed.

567
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:54,770
<19-6,BECKETT>但他想把什么藏起来
<19-6,BECKETT>But what was he trying to hide

568
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,830
<19-6,BECKETT>不被人发现呢
<19-6,BECKETT>that he didn't want anyone to find?

569
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,850
<19-7,BECKETT>血衣吗
<19-7,BECKETT>Bloody clothes?

570
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,400
<19-8,CASTLE>带着弹孔
<19-8,CASTLE>With bullet holes.

571
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:06,550
<20-1,LANIE>我能知道就是
<20-1,LANIE>Here's what I can tell you.

572
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,850
<20-1,LANIE>穿这衣服的人
<20-1,LANIE>the guy who wore these clothes

573
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:10,930
<20-1,LANIE>有六英尺高  大概重180到200磅
<20-1,LANIE>was about 6 feet, maybe 180, 200 pounds.

574
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,780
<20-3,LANIE>-他的伤势呢  -背后中了两枪
<20-3,LANIE>- What about his injuries? Two shots to the back.

575
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:14,840
<20-3,LANIE>两颗子弹都射穿了身体
<20-3,LANIE>Both bullets exited the front of his body.

576
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:16,910
<20-3,LANIE>根据他被枪射中的部位和出血量
<20-3,LANIE>Based on where he was hit and the amount of blood,

577
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,390
<20-3,LANIE>他可能已经死了
<20-3,LANIE>he probably didn't survive.

578
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,450
<20-4,ESPOSITO>有没有尸体上面有这种类型的伤口
<20-4,ESPOSITO>So did any stiffs come in with those kinds of wounds?

579
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:23,130
<20-5,LANIE>-当然了  要去除衣服  -我查过了  没有
<20-5,LANIE>- Minus his clothes, of course. - No. I already checked.

580
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,640
<20-6,BECKETT>你能推测出他是什么时候被击中的吗
<20-6,BECKETT>Can you tell when he was shot?

581
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:27,910
<20-7,LANIE>从血液凝固上看应该是过去的两天内
<20-7,LANIE>Blood coagulation says it was within the last two days.

582
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,180
<20-8,ESPOSITO>埃里克两天前没去上班  他的拼车软件显示
<20-8,ESPOSITO>Eric missed work two days ago, and his hytch app showed

583
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:32,420
<20-8,ESPOSITO>他去了皇后区的手术室
<20-8,ESPOSITO>that he went to that surgical suite in Queens.

584
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:34,440
<20-9,BECKETT>所以有可能是他的一个黑帮病人
<20-9,BECKETT>So then maybe this was one of his mob patients.

585
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:36,630
<20-10,CASTLE>他不是  至少根据迪诺所说的来看
<20-10,CASTLE>He wasn't -- at least not according to Dino.

586
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,540
<20-10,CASTLE>家族里没有人被枪击
<20-10,CASTLE>No recent gunshot wounds in the family,

587
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:40,500
<20-10,CASTLE>在过去的一周里埃里克没有给人治疗过
<20-10,CASTLE>And Eric hadn't treated anyone in the past week.

588
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:42,540
<20-11,BECKETT>那埃里克肯定给其他人治疗过
<20-11,BECKETT>Then Eric must have treated someone else,

589
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:44,890
<20-11,BECKETT>某个和卡鲁齐家族无关的人
<20-11,BECKETT>someone not connected to the Carluccis.

590
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:47,510
<20-11,BECKETT>这是否就意味着埃里克
<20-11,BECKETT>Could that mean that Eric operated

591
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,110
<20-11,BECKETT>给其他黑帮家族的人动过手术
<20-11,BECKETT>on someone from another family?

592
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,520
<20-12,CASTLE>如果是的话  有黑帮成员死亡或者失踪
<20-12,CASTLE>If he did, and said mobster is dead or missing,

593
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:53,570
<20-12,CASTLE>那麦克布莱德探长应该会知道
<20-12,CASTLE>then perhaps Detective McBride has heard about it.

594
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,450
<20-13,LANIE>同时  我会查一下DNA看血液是否
<20-13,LANIE>Meantime, I'll run D.N.A. to see if this blood

595
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:56,960
<20-13,LANIE>和系统上的人有匹配
<20-13,LANIE>matches anyone in the system.

596
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:58,110
<20-14,BECKETT>谢谢  蕾妮
<20-14,BECKETT>Thanks, Lanie.

597
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:05,250
<20-15,ESPOSITO>那今晚有什么计划
<20-15,ESPOSITO>Hey, hey. Hey. So what's the game plan

598
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,470
<20-15,ESPOSITO>在吃饭的时候能应付得了你爸妈
<20-15,ESPOSITO>to survive dinner with your parents?

599
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,990
<20-16,LANIE>我不知道  我们连五分钟都应付不了
<20-16,LANIE>I don't know. We barely survived five minutes with them.

600
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:09,710
<20-16,LANIE>你
<20-16,LANIE>You...

601
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,290
<20-17,ESPOSITO>万一他们问我们想住在哪儿
<20-17,ESPOSITO>What if they ask us where we want to live?

602
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,040
<20-17,ESPOSITO>什么时候要孩子怎么办
<20-17,ESPOSITO>When we want kids?

603
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,120
<20-17,ESPOSITO>他们肯定会看穿我们的  也许我们得坦白
<20-17,ESPOSITO>They're gonna see right through us. Maybe we should come clean.

604
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:18,790
<20-18,LANIE>哈维  我不能坦白
<20-18,LANIE>Javi, I can't come clean.

605
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,010
<20-18,LANIE>如果我坦白了  他们就会没完没了的
<20-18,LANIE>If I come clean, I will never hear the end of this.

606
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:24,780
<20-18,LANIE>听着  你已经见过他们  兑现了诺言
<20-18,LANIE>Look, you met them. You kept your promise.

607
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:25,930
<20-18,LANIE>晚餐你可以不去
<20-18,LANIE>You can skip dinner.

608
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:29,120
<20-18,LANIE>我就说有事情  比如一具死尸
<20-18,LANIE>I'll say something came up -- like a dead body.

609
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:30,280
<20-18,LANIE>没门
<20-18,LANIE>No way.

610
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:33,070
<20-19,ESPOSITO>我不能变成那种未婚夫
<20-19,ESPOSITO>I can't be the kind of fiance that bails

611
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,140
<20-19,ESPOSITO>你爸妈难得来一趟我不能爽约
<20-19,ESPOSITO>on the one time your parents were in town.

612
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:38,140
<20-19,ESPOSITO>我必须得去  我们订婚了
<20-19,ESPOSITO>I have to go. We're engaged.

613
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,560
<20-20,LANIE>我们没有
<20-20,LANIE>We're not engaged.

614
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:41,290
<20-21,ESPOSITO>但我们有可能订了
<20-21,ESPOSITO>But we could be.

615
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,380
<20-21,ESPOSITO>将来某一天
<20-21,ESPOSITO>Someday.

616
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:44,360
<20-21,ESPOSITO>我不想让他们因为我现在偷偷溜走
<20-21,ESPOSITO>And I don't want them to hate me then

617
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,150
<20-21,ESPOSITO>而到那时候讨厌我
<20-21,ESPOSITO>because I skipped out now.

618
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:52,380
<21-1,MCBRIDE>我问了一下其他的黑帮家族
<21-1,MCBRIDE>So I asked around about the other crime families,

619
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:53,810
<21-1,MCBRIDE>查了查看谁失踪了
<21-1,MCBRIDE>looked into who might have gone missing

620
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:56,260
<21-1,MCBRIDE>或者你懂的  在过去几天吃了子弹的
<21-1,MCBRIDE>or, you know, taken a bullet the last few days.

621
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:59,100
<21-1,MCBRIDE>我想我找到那人了  1米86  86公斤
<21-1,MCBRIDE>I think I got your guy. 6'1", 190 pounds.

622
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:00,400
<21-1,MCBRIDE>他能穿上那些衣服
<21-1,MCBRIDE>He'd fit in those clothes.

623
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:01,660
<21-1,MCBRIDE>卢卡·泰萨罗
<21-1,MCBRIDE>Luca Tessaro?

624
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:03,030
<21-2,BECKETT>是泰萨罗黑帮的吗
<21-2,BECKETT>Of the Tessaro crime family?

625
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,910
<21-3,MCBRIDE>是的  他们到处在说
<21-3,MCBRIDE>Yeah, and the family's beating the drums

626
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,160
<21-3,MCBRIDE>因为卢卡三天前失踪了
<21-3,MCBRIDE>because Luca disappeared three days ago.

627
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:09,010
<21-4,CASTLE>泰萨罗家族和卡鲁齐家族不是对手吗
<21-4,CASTLE>Aren't the Tessaros and the Carluccis rivals?

628
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,620
<21-5,MCBRIDE>更像是不共戴天的仇人
<21-5,MCBRIDE>More like sworn enemies.

629
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:13,450
<21-5,MCBRIDE>这也可能是那位医生被杀的原因
<21-5,MCBRIDE>Which could be why things went bad for your doctor.

630
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:15,000
<21-5,MCBRIDE>你不能家族越界
<21-5,MCBRIDE>You don't cross family lines.

631
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:18,000
<21-6,BECKETT>关于卢卡失踪我们知道些什么
<21-6,BECKETT>What do we know about Luca's disappearance?

632
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:19,800
<21-7,MCBRIDE>三天前  911接到电话
<21-7,MCBRIDE>Well, 3 nights ago, 9-1-1 got reports

633
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:21,500
<21-7,MCBRIDE>说他家附近有人开枪
<21-7,MCBRIDE>of shots fired near his neighborhood.

634
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:23,940
<21-7,MCBRIDE>有警员出动  但什么都没找到
<21-7,MCBRIDE>Officers responded. They didn't find anything.

635
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,710
<21-7,MCBRIDE>但卢卡自那时起就失踪了
<21-7,MCBRIDE>But Luca hasn't been seen since.

636
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:28,050
<21-9,MCBRIDE>-谢谢你  警探  -有什么要帮忙的  尽管说
<21-9,MCBRIDE>- Thank you, detective. - Whatever you need.

637
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:32,170
<21-10,BECKETT>为什么埃里克要给卢卡·泰萨罗治疗呢
<21-10,BECKETT>Why would Eric treat Luca Tessaro,

638
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,870
<21-10,BECKETT>一个敌对黑帮的成员
<21-10,BECKETT>a member of a rival family?

639
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,060
<21-11,CASTLE>瞧见没  这就是我加入黑帮的魅力所在
<21-11,CASTLE>See, this is the beauty of me being mobbed up.

640
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:38,430
<21-11,CASTLE>暂时地  我可以直接去问迪诺
<21-11,CASTLE>Temporarily. I can go straight to the source and ask Dino.

641
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,420
<21-12,BECKETT>卡塞尔  小心一点
<21-12,BECKETT>Castle, just be careful.

642
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:42,350
<21-12,BECKETT>如果埃里克救了卡鲁齐的敌人
<21-12,BECKETT>If Eric treated a Carlucci enemy,

643
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,850
<21-12,BECKETT>那迪诺就有杀人的动机
<21-12,BECKETT>then Dino had motive.

644
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,530
<21-13,CASTLE>如果这会牵扯上他
<21-13,CASTLE>Dino is not gonna ask me to investigate

645
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,360
<21-13,CASTLE>迪诺肯定不会让我继续调查的
<21-13,CASTLE>If it's gonna lead back to his doorstep.

646
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:50,140
<21-13,CASTLE>我肯定能带着答案回来的
<21-13,CASTLE>But I shall return with answers.

647
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:51,910
<21-14,BECKETT>我和他们会去调查
<21-14,BECKETT>The boys and I will check the area

648
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,450
<21-14,BECKETT>发生枪击的地方
<21-14,BECKETT>where those shots were fired.

649
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,370
<21-14,BECKETT>也许警员漏掉了什么
<21-14,BECKETT>Maybe officers missed something.

650
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:58,530
<22-1,RYAN>如果警员们遗漏了什么  我也找不到
<22-1,RYAN>Well, if unis missed something, I'm not finding it.

651
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:01,720
<22-2,BECKETT>五个报警的人都说在这地下通道附近
<22-2,BECKETT>All five 9-1-1 callers said they heard shots

652
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:02,990
<22-2,BECKETT>听到了枪声
<22-2,BECKETT>near this underpass,

653
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,570
<22-2,BECKETT>如果卢卡·泰萨罗是在这里被杀的
<22-2,BECKETT>So if Luca Tessaro was killed here,

654
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:07,290
<22-2,BECKETT>那肯定有留下证据
<22-2,BECKETT>there's got to be evidence.

655
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,270
<22-3,RYAN>如果他真的是被害人的话
<22-3,RYAN>Assuming he's really our victim.

656
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,620
<22-4,ESPOSITO>他肯定是了  蕾妮发短信来了
<22-4,ESPOSITO>Oh, he definitely is. Lanie just texted.

657
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:12,850
<22-4,ESPOSITO>卢卡·泰萨罗的资料在系统里
<22-4,ESPOSITO>Luca Tessaro's in the system,

658
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,990
<22-4,ESPOSITO>衣服上血迹的初步DNA检测结果
<22-4,ESPOSITO>and the prelim DNA markers from the bloody clothes

659
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,090
<22-4,ESPOSITO>与系统里的相符
<22-4,ESPOSITO>are a match.

660
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,990
<22-5,RYAN>卢卡和埃里克又是怎么扯上关系的
<22-5,RYAN>How did Luca and Eric cross paths in the first place?

661
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:25,880
<22-6,BECKETT>伙计们
<22-6,BECKETT>You guys?

662
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,130
<22-7,BECKETT>我找到了一个弹头
<22-7,BECKETT>I found a slug.

663
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,150
<22-7,BECKETT>叫鉴证科来
<22-7,BECKETT>Call CSU.

664
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:38,340
<22-8,RYAN>我也有所发现
<22-8,RYAN>Hey. I found something else.

665
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:39,910
<22-8,RYAN>来看看这个
<22-8,RYAN>Check this out.

666
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:43,610
<22-9,BECKETT>这是血迹
<22-9,BECKETT>That's blood.

667
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,830
<23-1,CASTLE>瑞克你一定知道不少家族事务的内幕吧
<23-1,CASTLE>Rocco, you must be privy to the inner workings of the family.

668
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,720
<23-1,CASTLE>不知是否介意我问几个问题呢
<23-1,CASTLE>Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?

669
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:55,280
<23-2,CASTLE>那  那我就认为你是默认同意了
<23-2,CASTLE>I'm gonna go ahead and take that as a -- as a "Yes."

670
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:58,590
<23-2,CASTLE>那首先  你对埃里克·梅瑟有多了解
<23-2,CASTLE>So, first of all, how well did you know Eric Mercer?

671
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:05,100
<23-3,CASTLE>你还真是不喜欢说话  瑞克
<23-3,CASTLE>You're a man of few words, Rocco.

672
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:07,850
<23-3,CASTLE>真是一句话都不愿说
<23-3,CASTLE>Very, very few words.

673
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:10,380
<23-3,CASTLE>那卢卡·泰萨罗呢
<23-3,CASTLE>How about Luca Tessaro?

674
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:12,240
<23-3,CASTLE>埃里克和他有什么过节吗
<23-3,CASTLE>Eric have any history with him?

675
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:15,780
<23-4,ROCCO>卢卡是个万人嫌
<23-4,ROCCO>Luca's a sore subject.

676
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:19,650
<23-5,CASTLE>万人嫌  为什么
<23-5,CASTLE>Uh, sore subject, why?

677
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:20,670
<23-5,CASTLE>因为他是泰萨罗家族的
<23-5,CASTLE>Because he's a Tessaro?

678
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,920
<23-6,ROCCO>因为他是他们家族的败类
<23-6,ROCCO>Because he's a stain upon his family.

679
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,010
<23-7,CASTLE>那我想埃里克应该不喜欢他
<23-7,CASTLE>Okay, I take it Eric didn't like him.

680
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:29,020
<23-8,ROCCO>埃里克讨厌卢卡  我们都讨厌他
<23-8,ROCCO>Eric hated Luca. We all do.

681
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,810
<23-8,ROCCO>因为他没有好好对简
<23-8,ROCCO>For what he did to Jane.

682
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:33,830
<23-9,CASTLE>迪诺的女儿  她怎么和这有关
<23-9,CASTLE>Dino's daughter? How is she involved?

683
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:39,210
<23-10,ROCCO>某天晚上她在一家俱乐部
<23-10,ROCCO>One night she's at this club.

684
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:43,410
<23-10,ROCCO>卢卡也在  他想对她动手动脚的
<23-10,ROCCO>Luca was there, and he tried to have his way with her.

685
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:45,210
<23-10,ROCCO>消息传到了迪诺那里
<23-10,ROCCO>Word got back to Dino.

686
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:46,930
<23-10,ROCCO>他都准备好杀了卢卡的
<23-10,ROCCO>He was ready to kill Luca.

687
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,780
<23-10,ROCCO>他想亲自动手的
<23-10,ROCCO>Wanted to pull the trigger himself.

688
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:52,440
<23-12,ROCCO>-那后来呢  -没  简阻止了他
<23-12,ROCCO>- Well, did he? - Mnh-mnh. Jane stopped him.

689
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:54,790
<23-12,ROCCO>她不想挑起家族之间的战争
<23-12,ROCCO>She didn't want a war between families.

690
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,710
<23-12,ROCCO>此外  她也是个非常有分寸的女人
<23-12,ROCCO>Besides, she's a woman who can take care of herself.

691
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:02,930
<24-1,CASTLE>贝克特  我刚发现了非常有意思的线索
<24-1,CASTLE>Hey, Beckett, I just got some very interesting news.

692
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,080
<24-2,BECKETT>我也是
<24-2,BECKETT>Yeah, so did I.

693
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:06,890
<24-2,BECKETT>我们在卢卡被枪击的现场发现了血迹
<24-2,BECKETT>We found blood evidence at the scene where Luca was shot.

694
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:08,070
<24-3,CASTLE>继续说
<24-3,CASTLE>Go on.

695
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,760
<24-4,BECKETT>一个手镯上沾满了卢卡的血迹
<24-4,BECKETT>It was Luca's blood on a bracelet.

696
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:12,580
<24-4,BECKETT>鉴证科从上面提取的指纹
<24-4,BECKETT>CSU pulled a thumbprint off of it

697
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:15,930
<24-4,BECKETT>与简·斯卡佩拉在车管所备案的相符
<24-4,BECKETT>that matched a DMV record for Jane Scarpella.

698
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,740
<24-4,BECKETT>她是迪诺的女儿
<24-4,BECKETT>She's Dino's daughter.

699
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:20,150
<24-4,BECKETT>有可能是简杀了卢卡
<24-4,BECKETT>Look, it's possible that Jane killed Luca.

700
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,560
<24-4,BECKETT>她叫埃里克帮她毁尸灭迹随后又杀了他
<24-4,BECKETT>She got Eric to help cover it up and then she killed him, too.

701
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:24,920
<24-4,BECKETT>只不过...我还不知道她的动机
<24-4,BECKETT>I just -- I don't know what her motive would be.

702
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:26,250
<24-5,CASTLE>我想我知道
<24-5,CASTLE>I think I do.

703
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:28,320
<24-6,BECKETT>不错  那快说说吧
<24-6,BECKETT>Good. Then let's hear it.

704
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:31,900
<24-7,CASTLE>不行  得挂了  稍后再打给你说
<24-7,CASTLE>Can't. I gotta go. I'll call you back and tell you later.

705
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,030
<24-7,CASTLE>但愿吧
<24-7,CASTLE>I hope.

706
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:36,160
<24-8,ROCCO>头儿现在就要见你
<24-8,ROCCO>The boss will see you now.

707
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:42,970
<24-9,CASTLE>迪诺
<24-9,CASTLE>Dino.

708
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:45,290
<24-10,DINO>有什么消息要告诉我吗  里克
<24-10,DINO>What news do you have for me, Rick?

709
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,410
<24-10,DINO>是谁杀了埃里克
<24-10,DINO>Who killed Eric?

710
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,320
<25-1,DINO>你就这么走进来...
<25-1,DINO>You come in here...

711
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,390
<25-1,DINO>到我的地盘上
<25-1,DINO>To my house of business

712
00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:00,350
<25-1,DINO>指控我的女儿犯了不是一起
<25-1,DINO>and accuse my daughter of not one

713
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,290
<25-1,DINO>而是两起谋杀案
<25-1,DINO>but two murders?

714
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:05,770
<25-2,CASTLE>并不是...指控的意思...
<25-2,CASTLE>Not...Accuse as much as....

715
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,980
<25-2,CASTLE>她大概算是个...嫌疑人吧
<25-2,CASTLE>Perhaps she's a...Person of interest.

716
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:11,120
<25-3,DINO>你以为我不懂那是什么意思吗
<25-3,DINO>You think I don't know what that means?

717
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:14,510
<25-3,DINO>你让我失望了  里克
<25-3,DINO>You disappoint me, Rick.

718
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:16,480
<25-3,DINO>我请你帮忙
<25-3,DINO>I came to you.

719
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,770
<25-3,DINO>我信任你
<25-3,DINO>I put my faith in you.

720
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,360
<25-3,DINO>我以为我俩之间达成了共识
<25-3,DINO>I thought we had an understanding.

721
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:22,420
<25-4,CASTLE>确实有
<25-4,CASTLE>We did.

722
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:24,760
<25-4,CASTLE>真的  你是...
<25-4,CASTLE>We do. Look, you're the last...

723
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,790
<25-5,CASTLE>迪诺  你要干...你要干什么
<25-5,CASTLE>Dino, what are you -- what are you doing?

724
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,850
<25-6,DINO>我绝不容忍谎言  里克
<25-6,DINO>I don't tolerate lies, Rick.

725
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:32,670
<25-7,CASTLE>迪诺...
<25-7,CASTLE>Dino -- eh -- hey...

726
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:35,090
<25-7,CASTLE>我们是一家人  记得吗
<25-7,CASTLE>Hey, we're family, remember?

727
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:36,340
<25-7,CASTLE>没错
<25-7,CASTLE>That's right.

728
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:39,710
<25-8,DINO>你绝不能不尊重家人
<25-8,DINO>You never disrespect family.

729
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,780
<25-9,CASTLE>谁不尊重你了
<25-9,CASTLE>Who disrespects you?

730
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:43,350
<25-9,CASTLE>我尊重你  迪诺
<25-9,CASTLE>I respect you, Dino.

731
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,570
<25-9,CASTLE>我非常非常尊重你
<25-9,CASTLE>I-I-I respect the hell out of you.

732
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:48,220
<25-9,CASTLE>爸爸  我听说卡塞尔先生
<25-9,CASTLE>Dad, I heard Mr. Castle

733
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:50,390
<25-10,JANE>知道杀害埃里克的凶手是谁
<25-10,JANE>had information on Eric's killer.

734
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,450
<25-10,JANE>怎么回事
<25-10,JANE>Oh. What's going on?

735
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:55,580
<25-11,DINO>先出去  简  我还有正事要办
<25-11,DINO>Step out, Jane. I'm conducting business.

736
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:57,780
<25-12,CASTLE>迪诺  你问她  问问她
<25-12,CASTLE>Dino, ask her. Ask her.

737
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:59,520
<25-12,CASTLE>看在以前交情的份上
<25-12,CASTLE>You at least owe me that much.

738
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:00,980
<25-12,CASTLE>如果她是有罪的  你得知道
<25-12,CASTLE>If she's guilty, you need to know.

739
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:02,240
<25-12,CASTLE>不然你也没法保护她
<25-12,CASTLE>Otherwise, you can't protect her.

740
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:04,610
<25-13,JANE>有罪  我犯什么罪了
<25-13,JANE>Guilty? Guilty of what?

741
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:05,880
<25-13,JANE>泰萨罗的死
<25-13,JANE>Of Tessaro's murder.

742
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:08,100
<25-14,CASTLE>警方在凶案现场发现了你的手镯
<25-14,CASTLE>Police found your bracelet where he was shot.

743
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:09,540
<25-15,DINO>简  你告诉他
<25-15,DINO>Jane, you tell him.

744
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:12,570
<25-15,DINO>告诉他你不在那里  简
<25-15,DINO>Tell him you weren't there, Jane.

745
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,820
<25-15,DINO>你最好告诉他
<25-15,DINO>You better tell him.

746
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,890
<25-16,DINO>告诉他  简  告诉他
<25-16,DINO>Tell him! Jane, tell him!

747
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:18,860
<25-17,JANE>老爸  我错了  我是在那里
<25-17,JANE>Daddy, I'm sorry! I was.

748
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,580
<25-17,JANE>可我没有杀他
<25-17,JANE>But I didn't kill him.

749
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:24,760
<25-17,JANE>我是想救他的
<25-17,JANE>I was trying to save him.

750
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:26,300
<25-18,CASTLE>救他
<25-18,CASTLE>Save him?

751
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:29,860
<25-19,JANE>爸爸  卢卡和我...
<25-19,JANE>Dad, Luca and I --

752
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:31,500
<25-19,JANE>我们相爱了
<25-19,JANE>We were in love.

753
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:33,970
<25-20,DINO>你们什么
<25-20,DINO>You were in what?

754
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:36,110
<25-20,DINO>在他对你那样之后
<25-20,DINO>After what he did to you?

755
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,900
<25-21,JANE>他对我动手动脚的事情...
<25-21,JANE>That story about him coming on to me --

756
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:38,830
<25-22,DINO>是我编的
<25-22,DINO>I made it up.

757
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,170
<25-22,DINO>你编的  什么意思  什么叫你编的
<25-22,DINO>Made it up? What do you mean, you made it up?

758
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,730
<25-23,JANE>不然我该怎么说呢
<25-23,JANE>What was I supposed to say?

759
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:45,130
<25-23,JANE>我和一个泰萨罗家族的人相爱了
<25-23,JANE>That I was in love with a Tessaro?

760
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:46,530
<25-23,JANE>任何一个家族知道了我们的秘密
<25-23,JANE>If either family knew our secret,

761
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:48,200
<25-23,JANE>我们就永远无法在一起了
<25-23,JANE>we could never be together.

762
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,300
<25-24,JANE>老爸...
<25-24,JANE>Daddy...

763
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:55,170
<25-25,DINO>先容我好好想一想
<25-25,DINO>I'm processing this news.

764
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:00,830
<25-25,DINO>简
<25-25,DINO>Jane, uh...

765
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,420
<25-26,CASTLE>那晚究竟发生了什么
<25-26,CASTLE>What happened that night?

766
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,420
<25-26,CASTLE>卢卡打电话给我的...
<25-26,CASTLE>Luca called me...

767
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:11,550
<25-27,JANE>他呼吸十分困难  他被枪击了
<25-27,JANE>Gasping for breath. He'd been shot.

768
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:14,870
<25-27,JANE>等我找到他时  他已经昏迷不醒了
<25-27,JANE>By the time I got to him, he was unconscious,

769
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:15,910
<25-27,JANE>快死了
<25-27,JANE>Dying.

770
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:19,220
<25-27,JANE>他需要我的帮助  我就把他拖进我车里
<25-27,JANE>He needed help, so I dragged him into my car.

771
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:21,930
<25-27,JANE>大概就是在那时我的手镯掉了
<25-27,JANE>That's probably how I lost my bracelet.

772
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,350
<25-28,CASTLE>那你就打电话给埃里克了
<25-28,CASTLE>So you called Eric.

773
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:25,510
<25-29,JANE>我也不知道该怎么办了
<25-29,JANE>I didn't know what else to do.

774
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:28,630
<25-29,JANE>埃里克跟我说在手术室等他
<25-29,JANE>Eric told me to meet him at the surgery room.

775
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,860
<25-29,JANE>他为了救卢卡拼尽了全力
<25-29,JANE>He did everything in his power to save Luca,

776
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:33,160
<25-29,JANE>可是...还是不行
<25-29,JANE>But...He couldn't.

777
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:35,200
<25-30,DINO>这也解释了埃里克为何被杀
<25-30,DINO>Which explains Eric's murder.

778
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:38,320
<25-30,DINO>如果泰萨罗家族的人发现埃里克和卢卡的死有关
<25-30,DINO>If the Tessaros found out Eric was involved in Luca's death,

779
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:39,970
<25-30,DINO>他们肯定会复仇的
<25-30,DINO>they would have retaliated.

780
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:43,650
<25-30,DINO>他们知道什么  简
<25-30,DINO>What did they know, Jane?

781
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:44,870
<25-31,JANE>什么都不知道
<25-31,JANE>Nothing.

782
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,920
<25-31,JANE>埃里克处理掉了尸体和衣服
<25-31,JANE>Eric got rid of the body and the clothes

783
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:50,660
<25-31,JANE>这样他们就不会怀疑到我们家族
<25-31,JANE>So nothing could lead them to our family.

784
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,540
<25-32,CASTLE>简  卢卡有在电话上跟你说
<25-32,CASTLE>Jane, did Luca tell you on the phone

785
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:54,590
<25-32,CASTLE>谁要置他于死地吗
<25-32,CASTLE>who shot him, who wanted him dead?

786
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:56,980
<25-33,JANE>没有  但是上周
<25-33,JANE>No. But last week

787
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:00,270
<25-33,JANE>他说泰萨罗家族出事了
<25-33,JANE>he said something was up with the Tessaros.

788
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:02,400
<25-33,JANE>有人要谋权篡位
<25-33,JANE>Somebody was making a power grab,

789
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:04,300
<25-33,JANE>他要找出那个人
<25-33,JANE>and he was trying to find out who.

790
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:05,520
<25-34,DINO>我发誓
<25-34,DINO>I swear...

791
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:08,850
<25-34,DINO>如果埃里克的死和泰萨罗家族有关
<25-34,DINO>if the Tessaros killed my Eric,

792
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:11,040
<25-34,DINO>我们就开战
<25-34,DINO>we're going to war.

793
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,600
<26-1,BECKETT>敌对家族的爱情故事
<26-1,BECKETT>Lovers from rival families.

794
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:18,770
<26-1,BECKETT>听起来就像《罗密欧与朱丽叶》
<26-1,BECKETT>Wow, that sounds like "Romeo and Juliet."

795
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:20,940
<26-2,CASTLE>正好埃里克也懂得开药
<26-2,CASTLE>Right down to Eric as the apothecary.

796
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,670
<26-3,ESPOSITO>证实了简的不在场证明
<26-3,ESPOSITO>Yo. Jane's alibi checks out.

797
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,490
<26-3,ESPOSITO>门卫表示在埃里克被杀时  她在家
<26-3,ESPOSITO>Doorman places her at home during Eric's murder.

798
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,870
<26-4,BECKETT>卢卡·泰萨罗被杀时候
<26-4,BECKETT>What about the street cams in the area

799
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,080
<26-4,BECKETT>-周边街道的摄像头呢  -查过了
<26-4,BECKETT>- around Luca Tessaro's shooting? - We looked.

800
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:30,720
<26-5,ESPOSITO>那条路没有摄像头覆盖
<26-5,ESPOSITO>There's no cameras out that way.

801
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,170
<26-6,BECKETT>也就是说线索又断了
<26-6,BECKETT>Which means we're dead in the water.

802
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,770
<26-6,BECKETT>也就是说我没了用处
<26-6,BECKETT>Which means I could be dead in the water.

803
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,690
<26-7,CASTLE>如果泰萨罗家族的成员杀了卢卡和埃里克
<26-7,CASTLE>If one of the Tessaros killed luca and eric,

804
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,840
<26-7,CASTLE>我们得找出凶手
<26-7,CASTLE>we need to figure out who it was.

805
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:38,550
<26-8,BECKETT>除非你在他们家族也有熟人
<26-8,BECKETT>Well, unless you got a bud in that family, too,

806
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,860
<26-8,BECKETT>他们不会开口的
<26-8,BECKETT>they're not gonna talk.

807
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:42,000
<26-9,RYAN>信用卡方面有线索了
<26-9,RYAN>Luckily, a credit card just did the talking.

808
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:44,580
<26-9,RYAN>你们还记得埃里克从丽塔那拿到的信用卡吗
<26-9,RYAN>Do you remember those hot numbers that Eric got from Rita?

809
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:45,640
<26-9,RYAN>刚才有人用了其中一张
<26-9,RYAN>Well, someone just used one of 'em

810
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:48,420
<26-9,RYAN>-叫了披萨外卖  -是凶手
<26-9,RYAN>- to order a pizza for delivery. - It's the killer.

811
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:49,820
<26-10,CASTLE>他一定是从埃里克的尸体拿走的
<26-10,CASTLE>He must have got the cards off Eric's body.

812
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:51,800
<26-11,BECKETT>-送去哪  -送到一个瓷砖进口公司
<26-11,BECKETT>- Delivery to where? - To a tile import business

813
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:54,530
<26-12,RYAN>持有人是卢卡的堂兄  但丁·泰萨罗
<26-12,RYAN>owned by Luca's cousin, Dante Tessaro.

814
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:56,390
<26-12,RYAN>随着卢卡的死去  但丁成为了
<26-12,RYAN>And with Luca out of the way, Dante becomes

815
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,570
<26-12,RYAN>泰萨罗家族的继承人
<26-12,RYAN>heir apparent to the Tessaro family.

816
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:00,640
<26-13,BECKETT>这家瓷砖公司  在哪里
<26-13,BECKETT>This tile business -- what's the address?

817
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,270
<27-1,BECKETT>就是这了
<27-1,BECKETT>This is it.

818
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:18,260
<28-1,LUCA TESSARO>再靠近一步就打爆你的头
<28-1,LUCA TESSARO>One more step and I'll blow your heads off.

819
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:20,850
<34-4,MCBRIDE>卢卡·泰萨罗
<34-4,MCBRIDE>Luca Tessaro?

820
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:23,650
<34-5,BECKETT>你还活着
<34-5,BECKETT>You're alive?

821
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,770
<29-1,BECKETT>卢卡  放下武器
<29-1,BECKETT>Luca, put your weapon down!

822
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:30,900
<29-2,LUCA>为什么  好让你干掉我  回去交差
<29-2,LUCA>Why? So you can take me out? Finish the job?

823
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:33,570
<29-3,BECKETT>-谁派你来的  -没人派我  泰萨罗先生
<29-3,BECKETT>- Who sent you? - Nobody sent us, Mr. Tessaro.

824
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:35,170
<29-3,BECKETT>我们不会杀了你的
<29-3,BECKETT>We're not here to kill you.

825
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:36,670
<29-4,CASTLE>事实上
<29-4,CASTLE>No, a-as a matter of fact,

826
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,430
<29-4,CASTLE>我们以为你死了
<29-4,CASTLE>we thought you were already dead.

827
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:40,180
<29-4,CASTLE>听着  如果你不相信我们
<29-4,CASTLE>Hey, look, if you don't believe us,

828
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,180
<29-4,CASTLE>你可以问问简
<29-4,CASTLE>you can always ask Jane!

829
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:44,400
<29-4,CASTLE>是不是  简
<29-4,CASTLE>Isn't that right, Jane?

830
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:48,270
<29-5,JANE>等等  没事的卢卡  他们帮得上忙
<29-5,JANE>Wait. It's okay, Luca. They can help.

831
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:00,360
<30-1,LUCA>我们知道我们的家族永远不会同意
<30-1,LUCA>We knew our families would never approve of what we had.

832
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:02,180
<30-1,LUCA>所以我们要利用这次机会
<30-1,LUCA>So we were gonna use the opportunity

833
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:04,610
<30-1,LUCA>一辈子远走高飞
<30-1,LUCA>to leave the life -- for good.

834
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:06,680
<30-1,LUCA>销声匿迹
<30-1,LUCA>Disappear.

835
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,480
<30-2,CASTLE>埃里克身上的信用卡
<30-2,CASTLE>Those credit cards that Eric got --

836
00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:11,030
<30-2,CASTLE>是要帮助你们私奔的吗
<30-2,CASTLE>They were to help you get away?

837
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,440
<30-3,LUCA>但当埃里克被杀死
<30-3,LUCA>But when Eric got popped,

838
00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:15,650
<30-3,LUCA>我想凶手和要杀我的是同一个人
<30-3,LUCA>I figured it was the same guy who shot me.

839
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,300
<30-3,LUCA>也许他发现我还活着
<30-3,LUCA>You know, maybe he found out I was alive

840
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:20,010
<30-3,LUCA>然后跟踪埃里克要杀我灭口
<30-3,LUCA>and went after Eric to get to me.

841
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,720
<30-4,BECKETT>是谁要杀你  卢卡
<30-4,BECKETT>Who was trying to kill you, Luca?

842
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:23,290
<30-5,LUCA>我没看见他的样子
<30-5,LUCA>I didn't see him.

843
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,560
<30-5,LUCA>没人见过他  但是
<30-5,LUCA>No one ever has, but...

844
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:28,230
<30-5,LUCA>他自称"半影"
<30-5,LUCA>he calls himself il Penumbra.

845
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:31,050
<30-6,CASTLE>你知道他的事吗
<30-6,CASTLE>Well, what do you know about him?

846
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:33,770
<30-7,LUCA>他是几个月前新出现的人物
<30-7,LUCA>He's a new player who showed up a few months ago.

847
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:36,890
<30-7,LUCA>他开始在我们的地盘和店家联系
<30-7,LUCA>He started hitting up store owners on our turf

848
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,010
<30-7,LUCA>收取保护费
<30-7,LUCA>for protection payments.

849
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:40,850
<30-8,BECKETT>那么那些店家一定认得他
<30-8,BECKETT>Well, then the store owners must know who he is.

850
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:44,250
<30-9,LUCA>他用化名通过电邮管他们要钱
<30-9,LUCA>He was reaching out to them anonymously...Through e-mail.

851
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:47,100
<30-9,LUCA>电汇付款否则后果自负
<30-9,LUCA>Wire the payment or face consequences.

852
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,960
<30-9,LUCA>我们的一个干洗店拒绝付钱给他
<30-9,LUCA>One of our dry cleaners refused to pay,

853
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,500
<30-9,LUCA>他的干洗店被烧为灰烬了
<30-9,LUCA>his store burned down to the ground.

854
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,460
<30-10,CASTLE>黑手党2.0
<30-10,CASTLE>Mafia 2.0.

855
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:57,600
<30-11,LUCA>不管这家伙是谁  他要侵占我们的地盘
<30-11,LUCA>Whoever this guy is, he was moving into our territory,

856
00:34:57,610 --> 00:34:59,610
<30-11,LUCA>家族派我去追踪他
<30-11,LUCA>and the family ordered me to track him down.

857
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:00,510
<30-11,LUCA>我发现了那些店主
<30-11,LUCA>I uncovered the account

858
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,380
<30-11,LUCA>电汇钱给他的那个银行账号
<30-11,LUCA>where the shopkeepers were wiring him the money.

859
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:04,100
<30-11,LUCA>之后  我就接到一个人的电话
<30-11,LUCA>Next thing I know, I get a call from some guy

860
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:05,430
<30-11,LUCA>说他可以帮我
<30-11,LUCA>saying he could help.

861
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:07,010
<30-12,CASTLE>他叫你在桥下和他见面
<30-12,CASTLE>He tells you to meet him under the bridge,

862
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,400
<30-12,CASTLE>但其实是个圈套
<30-12,CASTLE>but it's a setup.

863
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:13,560
<31-1,BECKETT>我们找店家谈过话证实了卢卡说的
<31-1,BECKETT>The shopkeepers we talked to confirmed Luca's story.

864
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:16,250
<31-1,BECKETT>"半影"已经恐吓他们数月了
<31-1,BECKETT>This il Penumbra's been terrorizing them for months.

865
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,130
<31-2,CASTLE>怎么追踪一个没见过的人呢
<31-2,CASTLE>How do you track someone who nobody's seen?

866
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:20,930
<31-3,ESPOSITO>没法通过卢卡发现的那个银行账户
<31-3,ESPOSITO>Not through that bank info that Luca uncovered.

867
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,720
<31-3,ESPOSITO>账户追踪到开曼群岛一个私人账户就断了
<31-3,ESPOSITO>It dead-ended at a private account in the Cayman islands.

868
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:24,100
<31-4,RYAN>考虑到国际银行法
<31-4,RYAN>And given international banking laws,

869
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:26,000
<31-4,RYAN>没有办法找出这开户人
<31-4,RYAN>there's no way to determine who owns that account.

870
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:27,350
<31-5,CASTLE>也许还有办法
<31-5,CASTLE>But maybe there is.

871
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:30,220
<31-5,CASTLE>我认识一个朋友也许能帮到我们
<31-5,CASTLE>I, uh, made a new friend who might help us

872
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:32,940
<31-5,CASTLE>绕开那些烦人的国际银行法
<31-5,CASTLE>skirt those pesky international banking laws.

873
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,810
<32-1,CASTLE>丽塔  我知道这是不情之请
<32-1,CASTLE>Now, Rita, I know this is a big ask,

874
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,470
<32-1,CASTLE>但如果我们能查出账户是谁的
<32-1,CASTLE>but if we can figure out who owns that account,

875
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,710
<32-1,CASTLE>我们就找出了埃里克的凶手
<32-1,CASTLE>we'll find Eric's real killer.

876
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,000
<32-2,RITA>这个"半影"
<32-2,RITA>Now is this Penumbra character

877
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:41,520
<32-2,RITA>和陷害克里斯托弗是同一个人吗
<32-2,RITA>the same guy that framed Christopher?

878
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:42,910
<32-3,CASTLE>我们觉得是的
<32-3,CASTLE>We believe so, yes.

879
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:45,000
<32-4,RITA>好吧  我帮你
<32-4,RITA>All right, fine, I'll help.

880
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:48,610
<32-4,RITA>但这是因为我不想圣诞节独守空闺
<32-4,RITA>But only 'cause I don't want to sleep alone on Christmas.

881
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:50,900
<32-5,CASTLE>你和克里斯托弗
<32-5,CASTLE>You and Christopher?

882
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,950
<32-6,RITA>好的
<32-6,RITA>Okay, and...

884
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,460
<32-6,RITA>开什么玩笑
<32-6,RITA>You gotta be kidding me.

885
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:01,130
<32-7,CASTLE>这个化名也太怂了
<32-7,CASTLE>It's not even a clever alias.

886
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:04,680
<32-8,RITA>也许这人用那化名
<32-8,RITA>You know, this guy might be using that alias

887
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:05,880
<32-8,RITA>去取现了
<32-8,RITA>to withdraw his cash,

888
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:08,250
<32-8,RITA>但我肯定他是远程开户
<32-8,RITA>but I bet he created the account remotely.

889
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,440
<32-9,CASTLE>你觉得你能到追踪
<32-9,CASTLE>You think you can trace the account

890
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:11,090
<32-9,CASTLE>原先开户的电脑吗
<32-9,CASTLE>back to the computer it originated from?

891
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,720
<32-10,RITA>我想你应该告诉克里斯托弗
<32-10,RITA>I think you should tell Christopher

892
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:15,100
<32-10,RITA>新年夜他能回来过夜
<32-10,RITA>he's sleeping over new year's eve, too.

893
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:20,530
<33-1,BECKET>丽塔破解了"半影"的开曼账户
<33-1,BECKET>Rita determined il Penumbra's Cayman account

894
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:24,420
<33-1,BECKET>是用市中心图书馆分馆的服务器开户的
<33-1,BECKET>was opened using a server at the midtown library branch.

895
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:25,930
<33-2,RYAN>公共终端  这就说得通了
<33-2,RYAN>Public terminal. Makes sense.

896
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:28,170
<33-3,ESPOSITO>尤其是大部分的图书馆都没有监控摄像
<33-3,ESPOSITO>Especially since most libraries don't have security cameras.

897
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:30,520
<33-4,CASTLE>但是对街的便利店有监控摄像
<33-4,CASTLE>But the convenience store across the street from this one does,

898
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:32,280
<33-4,CASTLE>所以我们调取"半影"在当天
<33-4,CASTLE>so we pulled the video feed from the same day

899
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:33,950
<33-4,CASTLE>去开户的监控
<33-4,CASTLE>that il penumbra created the account.

900
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,970
<33-5,BECKETT>有时间标记的  因此
<33-5,BECKETT>It's time-stamped, so...

901
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,070
<33-5,BECKETT>在这
<33-5,BECKETT>There.

902
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,740
<33-5,BECKETT>这是开户之后唯一一个
<33-5,BECKETT>That's the only person who leaves

903
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:43,280
<33-5,BECKETT>几分钟之后离开的人
<33-5,BECKETT>in the minutes after the account was opened.

904
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,280
<33-5,BECKETT>你好  圣诞坏人
<33-5,BECKETT>Well, hello, bad santa.

905
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,560
<34-1,BECKETT>谢谢你能来见我们  警探
<34-1,BECKETT>Thanks for coming to see us, detective.

906
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:49,560
<34-2,MCBRIDE>不客气
<34-2,MCBRIDE>Of course.

907
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:52,090
<34-3,BECKETT>我们在调查中有所发现
<34-3,BECKETT>Our investigation uncovered something

908
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,180
<34-3,BECKETT>希望组织犯罪调查科
<34-3,BECKETT>that we hope the Qrganized Crime Unit

909
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:55,980
<34-3,BECKETT>能提供一些线索
<34-3,BECKETT>might have information about.

910
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:57,110
<34-4,MCBRIDE>你们发现了什么
<34-4,MCBRIDE>Uh, what'd you find?

911
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,960
<34-5,BECKETT>卢卡·泰萨罗还活着
<34-5,BECKETT>Luca Tessaro -- alive.

912
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,070
<34-6,MCBRIDE>你们之前跟我提到过那件血衣
<34-6,MCBRIDE>Uh, from the clothes that you told me about,

913
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,610
<34-6,MCBRIDE>-我以为他已经死了  -差点就死了
<34-6,MCBRIDE>- I assumed that he was dead. - He almost was.

914
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,740
<34-8,BECKETT>我们相信朝卢卡开枪的人
<34-8,BECKETT>We believe the person that shot Luca

915
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:09,440
<34-8,BECKETT>为了掩盖自己的罪行把埃里克·梅瑟也杀了
<34-8,BECKETT>also killed Eric Mercer to cover their tracks,

916
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:10,630
<34-8,BECKETT>也就是说凶手知道
<34-8,BECKETT>which means the shooter knew

917
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,070
<34-8,BECKETT>这两个人有联系
<34-8,BECKETT>that the two of them were in contact.

918
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,620
<34-9,RYAN>凶手称自己为"半影"
<34-9,RYAN>The shooter goes by the name of "Il Penumbra".

919
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:16,770
<34-9,RYAN>-听过这名字吗  -没印象
<34-9,RYAN>- Does that ring a bell? - Can't say it does.

920
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:18,810
<34-11,RYAN>好吧  这个"半影"
<34-11,RYAN>Huh. Okay, well, this, uh, Il Penumbra --

921
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:21,340
<34-11,RYAN>开了一辆类似克里斯托弗·卡鲁齐的野马去犯罪
<34-11,RYAN>he planted evidence to frame Christopher Carlucci

922
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:24,050
<34-11,RYAN>并留下证据  企图把埃里克的谋杀案
<34-11,RYAN>of Eric's murder after using a mustang like Christopher's

923
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,520
<34-11,RYAN>嫁祸给他
<34-11,RYAN>to commit the crime.

924
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,680
<34-12,MCBRIDE>我不知道你们要说什么
<34-12,MCBRIDE>I'm not sure where you're going with this.

925
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:29,320
<34-13,BECKETT>你的邻居有一辆黑色野马
<34-13,BECKETT>Your neighbor owns a black mustang.

926
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,830
<34-13,BECKETT>他说你那晚塞了点钱给他
<34-13,BECKETT>He said that you slipped him a little cash

927
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,350
<34-13,BECKETT>借了他的车
<34-13,BECKETT>to borrow it for that night.

928
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,720
<34-14,RYAN>我们让鉴证组彻底搜索过那辆车
<34-14,RYAN>We had C.S.U. sweep the car.

929
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:35,190
<34-15,BECKETT>他们在车里的地垫上找到了
<34-15,BECKETT>They found traces of Eric's blood

930
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,630
<34-15,BECKETT>你靴子留下的埃里克的血迹
<34-15,BECKETT>on the floor mat left there by your boot.

931
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:39,460
<34-16,MCBRIDE>你是在指控我谋杀吗
<34-16,MCBRIDE>Are you accusing me of murder?

932
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:41,730
<34-17,BECKETT>还有卢卡·泰萨罗的谋杀未遂案
<34-17,BECKETT>Along with the attempted murder of Luca Tessaro

933
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:43,590
<34-17,BECKETT>以及勒索重罪
<34-17,BECKETT>and felony extortion.

934
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:45,310
<34-17,BECKETT>我们找到了你在开曼群岛的账户
<34-17,BECKETT>We found the account in the Caymans.

935
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,730
<34-17,BECKETT>你在有组织犯罪部门工作了16年
<34-17,BECKETT>You've been working O.C.U. for 16 years

936
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:49,230
<34-17,BECKETT>眼睁睁看着那些不法分子发财
<34-17,BECKETT>watching bad guys get rich.

937
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:51,050
<34-18,RYAN>于是你决定要黑白都占
<34-18,RYAN>So you decided to play both sides,

938
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:52,830
<34-18,RYAN>也分上一杯羹
<34-18,RYAN>get a little piece of the action.

939
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:54,980
<34-19,MCBRIDE>这在法庭上是站不住脚的
<34-19,MCBRIDE>This will never fly in court.

940
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:56,970
<34-20,BECKETT>那我们只有走着看了
<34-20,BECKETT>Yeah, well, there's only one way to find out.

941
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:07,600
<35-1,DINO>里克
<35-1,DINO>Rick.

942
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:16,570
<35-2,CASTLE>卡塞尔先生
<35-2,CASTLE>Mr. Castle...

943
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,710
<35-3,CHRISTOPHER>我心怀感激
<35-3,CHRISTOPHER>I'm very grateful.

944
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:19,990
<35-3,CHRISTOPHER>丽塔也是
<35-3,CHRISTOPHER>And so is Rita.

945
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:22,570
<35-4,DINO>还有我女儿简  她也让我转达谢意
<35-4,DINO>And my daughter Jane -- she thanks you, too.

946
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:24,350
<35-5,CASTLE>她和卢卡接下来会怎样
<35-5,CASTLE>What's gonna happen to her and Luca?

947
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:27,420
<35-6,DINO>我决定还是祝福他们
<35-6,DINO>I decided it's better to bless her relationship

948
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:30,850
<35-6,DINO>并且跟泰萨罗家联姻而不是为此失去自己的孩子
<35-6,DINO>and unite with the Tessaros than to lose my kid.

949
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,700
<35-6,DINO>现在是和平的季节  对吧
<35-6,DINO>'Tis the season of peace, no?

950
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:34,160
<35-6,DINO>里克
<35-6,DINO>Rick...

951
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,190
<35-7,DINO>你帮了我一个忙
<35-7,DINO>you did me a favor.

952
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,290
<35-7,DINO>我欠你的
<35-7,DINO>I owe you.

953

<35-8,CASTLE>That's a call I hope I never have to make.

970
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:27,590
<36-11,ESPOSITO>要容易得多
<36-11,ESPOSITO>than I thought it was gonna be.

<36-12,ESPOSITO>但是
<36-12,ESPOSITO>But, you know,

972
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:32,660

00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,310
<36-12,ESPOSITO>和咱俩现在的交往状态
<36-12,ESPOSITO>and where we are.

974
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:38,990
<36-13,LANIE>哈维  我觉得这件事还是不要在这谈吧
<36-13,LANIE>Javi, I-I don't think we should do this here.

975
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,580
<36-14,ESPOSITO>不  我必须得说
<36-14,ESPOSITO>No, I have to say this.

<36-14,ESPOSITO>蕾妮
<36-14,ESPOSITO>Lanie...

977
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:45,250
<36-14,ESPOSITO>跟你假订婚这件事
<36-14,ESPOSITO>being fake engaged to you

978

<36-14,ESPOSITO>让我意识到 咱俩在一起有多开心
<36-14,ESPOSITO>made me realize how great we are together.

979
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,700
<36-14,ESPOSITO>但不是以你父母那种方式
<36-14,ESPOSITO>But not the way that your parents are.

980
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:54,700
<36-14,ESPOSITO>或是卡塞尔和贝克特

<36-16,ESPOSITO>不是那种方式
<36-16,ESPOSITO>not in that way.

986
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:08,110
<36-16,ESPOSITO>而你应该过那样的生活
<36-16,ESPOSITO>And you deserve what they have.

987
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,740
<36-17,LANIE>我们俩都应该
<36-17,LANIE>We both do.

988
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:15,900
<36-18,ESPOSITO>那你怎么跟你父母说啊
<36-18,ESPOSITO>What are you gonna tell your parents?

<36-19,LANIE>没必要现在毁了他们的假期
<36-19,LANIE>No need to spoil their vacation.

991
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,960
<37-1,RYAN>所以他用一把仪式匕首割了你的手
<37-1,RYAN>So then he cut you with a little ceremonial dagger.

993
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:28,500
<37-2,CASTLE>但你不能让他看出来  对吧
<37-2,CASTLE>but you can't let him know that, right?

994
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:31,080
<37-2,CASTLE>-所以我面无表情  -黑手党
<37-2,CASTLE>- So my face was like a stone. - The Black Hand.

<37-8,CASTLE>Is there a problem, captain?

1001
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,960
<37-9,GATES>在麦克布莱德警探被转移到县监狱的途中
<37-9,GATES>As he was being transferred to Central Booking,

1002
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:44,750
<37-9,GATES>被不明身份的袭击者

1003
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,480
<37-9,GATES>枪击身亡了
<37-9,GATES>by unknown assailants.

1004
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,100
<37-9,GATES>检察官得知在你调查的过程中
<37-9,GATES>The D.A. learned that you were cooperating

1005
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:52,300
<37-9,GATES>曾跟有组织犯罪的成员合作
<37-9,GATES>with members of organized crime in your investigation,

1006
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,910
<37-9,GATES>而他们可能会想要麦克布莱德的命
<37-9,GATES>people who might have wanted McBride dead.

1007
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:57,300
<37-9,GATES>这看起来可不妙
<37-9,GATES>Uh...this doesn't look good.

1008
00:40:57,310 --> 00:40:58,610
<37-9,GATES>特别是对你
<37-9,GATES>Especially for you.

1009
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:01,810
<37-9,GATES>我很抱歉  卡塞尔先生
<37-9,GATES>I am so sorry, Mr. Castle,

1010
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:05,380
<37-9,GATES>但是检察官上报了市长
<37-9,GATES>but the D.A. spoke to the mayor, and...

1011
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:12,260
<37-9,GATES>市长现在不许你继续跟着纽约警局办案了
<37-9,GATES>you are no longer permitted to work with the N.Y.P.D.

1012
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:19,680
<37-9,GATES>卡塞尔
<37-9,GATES>Castle.

1013
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:23,860
<37-10,BECKETT>听着  我
<37-10,BECKETT>Okay, so, I, um...
