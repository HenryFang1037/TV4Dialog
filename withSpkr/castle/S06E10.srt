00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:16,800
<16-10,BECKETT>*我们无法渡河*
<16-10,BECKETT>*And we cannot get o'er*

3
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:23,160
<16-11,SANDRA>*而我们又无双翼*
<16-11,SANDRA>*And neither have we*

4
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:28,890
<16-12,CASTLE>*无法飞身过河*
<16-12,CASTLE>*Wings to fly*

11
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:54,160
<16-12,CASTLE>卡塞尔  我以为就是个小聚会
<16-12,CASTLE>Castle, I thought this was gonna be a small gathering. I mean...

<1-1,KATE BECKETT>你买的食物够50个人吃了
<1-1,KATE BECKETT>There's enough food in here for, like, 50 people.

13
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,460
<1-2,RICHARD CASTLE>永远不要低估剩菜的重要性
<1-2,RICHARD CASTLE>Never underestimate the importance of leftovers--

14
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,480
<1-2,RICHARD CASTLE>隔夜填馅  火鸡汤
<1-2,RICHARD CASTLE>second-day stuffing, turkey soup,

<1-2,RICHARD CASTLE>微波炉加热洋芋  再扫荡一下食物银行
<1-2,RICHARD CASTLE>microwave yams, and a visit to the food bank.

16
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,460
<1-4,CASTLE>还有  阿丽克西斯总会做甜点
<1-4,CASTLE>And so that you know, Alexis always makes dessert.

17
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:11,880
<1-4,CASTLE>派说他要做个什么小红莓调和酒
<1-4,CASTLE>Pi said he would make a cranberry concoction of some kind.

18
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,310
<1-4,CASTLE>就连我妈也会下厨
<1-4,CASTLE>Even mother cooks something.

19
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:15,960
<1-5,MARTHA RODGERS>-虽然不是都能下咽  -我听到了
<1-5,MARTHA RODGERS>- It's not always edible. - I heard that!

20
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:17,880
<1-6,BECKETT>知道吗  我做的...
<1-6,BECKETT>Well, you know what? I make a...

21
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:21,810
<1-6,BECKETT>填馅超级好吃  我爸爸的烤玉米羹也非常拿手
<1-6,BECKETT>killer stuffing, and my dad makes a great traditional corn casserole.

22
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:24,530
<1-7,CASTLE>好啊  而且我知道你该穿什么服装
<1-7,CASTLE>Nice. And I know the perfect costume for you,

23
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:25,700
<1-7,CASTLE>你就别担心了
<1-7,CASTLE>so you don't have to worry.

24
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,750
<1-8,BECKETT>服装
<1-8,BECKETT>A costume?

25
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,410
<1-9,CASTLE>我要扮演首批移民约翰·罗尔夫
<1-9,CASTLE>Yeah, I'm gonna be, uh, settler John Rolfe,

26
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:32,150
<1-9,CASTLE>所以不用说  你要扮他的新娘宝嘉康蒂
<1-9,CASTLE>so you will, obviously, be Pocahontas--his bride.

27
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:33,960
<1-9,CASTLE>阿丽克西斯拿不定主意
<1-9,CASTLE>Alexis goes back and forth.

28
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,420
<1-9,CASTLE>有时候扮清教徒  有时候又扮美国土著
<1-9,CASTLE>Sometimes she's Puritan. Sometimes she's native American.

29
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,790
<1-9,CASTLE>要看她当时的心情了
<1-9,CASTLE>Just depends on where she is in her life.

30
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:39,650
<1-9,CASTLE>你父亲想扮哪一方都行  不用太复杂
<1-9,CASTLE>Your dad can be whichever. Nothing elaborate.

31
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:43,150
<1-10,BECKETT>你们感恩节还要穿服装吗
<1-10,BECKETT>Uh, so you guys-- you guys dress up for thanksgiving?

32
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:44,480
<1-11,CASTLE>这不是传统吗
<1-11,CASTLE>Doesn't everybody?

33
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:46,400
<1-12,BECKETT>不  这是你家的传统
<1-12,BECKETT>No, I think that's pretty special to you.

34
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,810
<1-12,BECKETT>我们结婚之前我还需要了解什么
<1-12,BECKETT>Um... so is there anything else I should know about you

35
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:49,910
<1-12,BECKETT>关于你的事吗
<1-12,BECKETT>before we get married?

36
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:52,000
<1-13,CASTLE>好多呢
<1-13,CASTLE>So many, many things.

37
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,550
<1-14,BECKETT>市中心一座教堂发生凶案
<1-14,BECKETT>There's been a murder in a church downtown.

38
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:58,620
<1-15,CASTLE>可惜不是在大教堂啊
<1-15,CASTLE>Too bad it wasn't in a cathedral.

39
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,340
<1-15,CASTLE>那就太像T.S.艾略特的风格了
<1-15,CASTLE>That would be so T.S. Eliot.

40
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,310
<1-15,CASTLE>《大教堂谋杀案》啊  托马斯·贝克特[故事主角]
<1-15,CASTLE>"Murder in the Cathedral"? Thomas Becket,

41
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,320
<1-16,BECKETT>-都是贝克特啊  -走吧
<1-16,BECKETT>- Beckett and Becket? - Come on.

42
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,420
<1-17,CASTLE>-这么不给面子  -走吧
<1-17,CASTLE>- Nothing? - Let's go.

43
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,450
<1-17,CASTLE>-谁给个反应嘛  -谢谢
<1-17,CASTLE>- Anyone? - Thank you.

44
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,410
<2-1,CASTLE>等我们结婚的时候
<2-1,CASTLE>You know, when we do this,

45
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:14,510
<2-1,CASTLE>可别在红毯尽头摆具尸体
<2-1,CASTLE>let's not do the dead body in the middle of the aisle.

46
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,770
<2-2,BECKETT>好想法
<2-2,BECKETT>Okay. Good call.

47
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,290
<2-2,BECKETT>怎么回事
<2-2,BECKETT>So what happened?

48
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:21,340
<2-3,KEVIN RYAN>死者6点半在弥撒期间走进教堂
<2-3,KEVIN RYAN>Well, our victim entered the church during 6:30 mass

49
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,870
<2-3,KEVIN RYAN>身中数枪
<2-3,KEVIN RYAN>with multiple gunshot wounds,

50
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,470
<2-3,KEVIN RYAN>一路走到祭坛前
<2-3,KEVIN RYAN>made his way towards the altar

51
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,220
<2-3,KEVIN RYAN>然后便摔倒在地
<2-3,KEVIN RYAN>before collapsing.

52
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:28,670
<2-4,JAVIER ESPOSITO>不过倒下之前还给了牧师点东西
<2-4,JAVIER ESPOSITO>But not before handing the priest a little somethin' somethin'.

53
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:32,690
<2-5,CASTLE>宝宝
<2-5,CASTLE>A baby?!

54
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:36,970
<2-6,LANIE PARISH>男婴  我猜他有三个月大了
<2-6,LANIE PARISH>A boy. I'm guessing he's about 3 months.

55
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,300
<2-6,LANIE PARISH>而且他饿了  总来摸我的胸
<2-6,LANIE PARISH>And he's hungry, 'cause he keeps going after the girls.

56
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,110
<2-7,CASTLE>不能怪他啊  你好啊  小家伙
<2-7,CASTLE>Well, who can blame him? Hi, buddy.

57
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:43,620
<2-7,CASTLE>你叫什么  小伙子
<2-7,CASTLE>What's your name, little man?

58
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,830
<2-8,LANIE>问得好
<2-8,LANIE>That is a very good question.

59
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:51,080
<2-9,BECKETT>-这是孩子的父亲吗  -我们还不知道
<2-9,BECKETT>- So is this the baby's father? - We don't really know.

60
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,910
<2-10,RYAN>但我们知道他叫卡梅隆·杜卡恩
<2-10,RYAN>But what we do know is his name is Cameron Ducane,

61
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,740
<2-11,ESPOSITO>30岁  住在布朗克斯
<2-11,ESPOSITO>30, lived in the Bronx.

62
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,500
<2-11,ESPOSITO>他钱包里没有宝宝的照片
<2-11,ESPOSITO>There's no baby pictures in his wallet.

63
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,260
<2-11,ESPOSITO>他有个商务车司机执照
<2-11,ESPOSITO>He's got a commercial driver's license--

64
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:00,850
<2-11,ESPOSITO>大概是个职业司机
<2-11,ESPOSITO>Probably drives for a living.

65
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:03,070
<2-11,ESPOSITO>有个洗车券
<2-11,ESPOSITO>He's got a car wash coupon,

66
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:07,250
<2-11,ESPOSITO>跟莱恩一样  他把辛苦赚来的钱
<2-11,ESPOSITO>and, like Ryan, spent his hard-earned money

67
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,480
<2-11,ESPOSITO>买了彩票
<2-11,ESPOSITO>on a lottery ticket.

68
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,340
<2-12,RYAN>那可是五州魔法球大奖  两亿4700万
<2-12,RYAN>That is the 5 state magicball jackpot at $247 million.

69
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,750
<2-12,RYAN>不买才是疯了
<2-12,RYAN>You're crazy not buying a ticket.

70
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,720
<2-13,ESPOSITO>买一两张得了  你买了50张
<2-13,ESPOSITO>Yeah, 1 or 2, but not 50.

71
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,040
<2-14,RYAN>我只是想增加中奖几率
<2-14,RYAN>I'm just increasing my odds of winning.

72
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,110
<2-15,ESPOSITO>你是增加破产几率吧
<2-15,ESPOSITO>Increasing your odds of being broke.

73
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,850
<2-16,RYAN>你知道在纽约市养个孩子
<2-16,RYAN>Listen, do you have any idea what it costs

74
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:21,130
<2-16,RYAN>要花多少钱吗
<2-16,RYAN>raising a child in New York city?

75
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:22,070
<2-17,ESPOSITO>我不知道要花多少钱
<2-17,ESPOSITO>I don't know how much it costs--

76
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:23,400
<2-18,RYAN>-伙计们  -你当然不知道
<2-18,RYAN>- Guys. - Well, of course you don't.

77
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,510
<2-19,ESPOSITO>-伙计们  -我不是...
<2-19,ESPOSITO>- Guys! - I'm not--

78
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:27,550
<2-20,CASTLE>我们别当着宝宝的面吵架好不好
<2-20,CASTLE>How about we don't fight in front of the baby?

79
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,290
<2-21,BECKETT>联系杜卡恩的近亲
<2-21,BECKETT>Okay, contact Ducane's next of kin.

80
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:35,010
<2-21,BECKETT>看看这个小家伙是不是他的孩子
<2-21,BECKETT>Let's see if this little guy is, indeed, his.

81
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,830
<2-22,CASTLE>那这段时间他要去哪
<2-22,CASTLE>And then what happens to him in the meantime?

82
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:38,450
<2-23,BECKETT>我们会联系儿童福利机构
<2-23,BECKETT>Well, we'll get ahold of child services...

83
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:41,190
<2-23,BECKETT>他们会安置他  直到我们能把他还给他家人
<2-23,BECKETT>and they'll place him until we're able to get him back to his family.

84
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:43,750
<2-23,BECKETT>我觉得蕾妮说得对  他好像是饿了
<2-23,BECKETT>I think Lanie's right. I think he is hungry.

85
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,360
<2-24,CASTLE>你们在这儿扫尾
<2-24,CASTLE>Um, how about you finish up here?

86
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,320
<2-24,CASTLE>我找个警员
<2-24,CASTLE>I'll grab a uniform,

87
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,810
<2-24,CASTLE>跟我去给他买点东西
<2-24,CASTLE>and we'll just go pick up some stuff for him?

88
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:49,620
<2-25,BECKETT>你真心的吗
<2-25,BECKETT>You really want to do that?

89
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,600
<2-26,CASTLE>当然  我资质颇深  我有儿童保育的RHD
<2-26,CASTLE>Of course. Highly qualified. I have an R.H.D. in child care.

90
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,490
<2-27,BECKETT>RHD是什么
<2-27,BECKETT>And an R.H.D. is...

91
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,020
<2-28,CASTLE>"狂野帅气爹"
<2-28,CASTLE>"Ruggedly handsome dad."

92
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,980
<2-29,BECKETT>好吧  去吧
<2-29,BECKETT>Okay. Fine. Go.

93
00:03:58,510 --> 00:03:59,760
<2-30,CASTLE>伙计  我们走
<2-30,CASTLE>Hey, buddy... let's go.

94
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,510
<2-31,CASTLE>别看她啊  走吧  我们去买冰淇淋
<2-31,CASTLE>Don't look at her. Come on. We'll get ice cream.

95
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,390
<2-32,BECKETT>知道他是在哪中枪的吗
<2-32,BECKETT>Do we know where he was shot?

96
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,820
<3-1,ESPOSITO>警员发现时  车还没熄火
<3-1,ESPOSITO>Uniforms found it with the engine running

97
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,490
<3-1,ESPOSITO>两边车门大开
<3-1,ESPOSITO>and both doors wide open.

98
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,810
<3-2,BECKETT>有人从上面向他开枪
<3-2,BECKETT>Someone fired at him from above,

99
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,860
<3-2,BECKETT>穿过车顶
<3-2,BECKETT>through the roof.

100
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,600
<3-2,BECKETT>好多血啊
<3-2,BECKETT>That's a lot of blood.

101
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,420
<3-3,RYAN>发现少了点什么吗
<3-3,RYAN>Notice what's missing?

102
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:22,780
<3-4,BECKETT>没有安全座椅
<3-4,BECKETT>There's no car seat.

103
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,660
<3-5,ESPOSITO>-说  -不论是怎么回事
<3-5,ESPOSITO>- Yeah. - Whatever happened,

104
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,140
<3-6,RYAN>我想他并没打算开车带着个小宝宝
<3-6,RYAN>I don't think he planned on having a baby with him.

105
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,310
<3-7,BECKETT>看不出他到底开了多久
<3-7,BECKETT>There's no way of telling how long he had been driving.

106
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,940
<3-7,BECKETT>他或许是在附近被枪击的
<3-7,BECKETT>I mean, he could have been shot nearby...

107
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:30,390
<3-8,RYAN>-也可能是在很远的地方  -好吧
<3-8,RYAN>- Or miles away. - Right.

108
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:32,380
<3-9,BECKETT>让警员查看交通监控录像
<3-9,BECKETT>Have uniforms go through traffic cam footage.

109
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,360
<3-9,BECKETT>看看能不能查清
<3-9,BECKETT>Let's see if we can figure out

110
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:34,950
<3-9,BECKETT>这车是从哪个方向过来的
<3-9,BECKETT>what direction this car was coming from.

111
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,000
<3-10,ESPOSITO>找到死者的妻子了  那不是他们的孩子
<3-10,ESPOSITO>We found the victim's wife. It's not their kid.

112
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,690
<3-10,ESPOSITO>我们才结婚两年
<3-10,ESPOSITO>We've only been married for two years.

113
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:42,100
<3-10,ESPOSITO>我们还没准备好要孩子
<3-10,ESPOSITO>We weren't ready for a baby.

114
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:44,720
<4-1,BECKETT>会是你们哪位朋友或亲戚的孩子吗
<4-1,BECKETT>Could the baby be a friend's or a relative's?

115
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:47,200
<4-1,BECKETT>不会  我从没见过他
<4-1,BECKETT>No, I've never seen him before.

116
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:51,230
<4-2,BECKETT>丽莎  我知道这不好受  但会不会
<4-2,BECKETT>Lissa, I know this is hard, but is it possible

117
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:54,370
<4-2,BECKETT>-卡梅跟别的女人有了孩子  -不可能

<4-2,BECKETT>Cam told me everything.

119
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:57,440
<4-3,BECKETT>他绝不会保守那么大的秘密
<4-3,BECKETT>He wouldn't have kept a secret like that.

<4-3,BECKETT>好吧  他今早去哪了

132
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,750
<6-22,RYAN>怎么说呢...疑神疑鬼

<6-7,BECKETT>and he put extra locks on all of our doors.

137
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:45,340
<6-29,BECKETT>想保证我的安全

<5-3,RYAN>我们知道他昨晚值了夜班
<5-3,RYAN>We know he worked the overnight yesterday.

00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:03,420
<5-4,ROMAN>他没有  他昨晚的确是该来上班
<5-4,ROMAN>He didn't. He was on the books to work last night,

146
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:06,140
<5-5,RYAN>-但他根本没来  -他常这样吗

<5-6,ROMAN>在这儿一年半了  第一次这样
<5-6,ROMAN>Nah, a year and a half here. That was his first time.

148
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:10,580
<5-7,ESPOSITO>你注意到他工作上有什么事吗
<5-7,ESPOSITO>You notice anything going on with him at work--

149
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,880
<5-7,ESPOSITO>不太寻常的事
<5-7,ESPOSITO>Anything unusual?

150
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,600
<5-8,ROMAN>对了  上周有个人来过
<5-8,ROMAN>Yeah, yeah, there was that guy that showed up last week.

151
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,110
<5-8,ROMAN>小心点  伙计们  开出来吧
<5-8,ROMAN>Watch yourselves. Guys, bring it out.

152
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:17,580
<5-9,RYAN>什么人
<5-9,RYAN>What guy?

153
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,360
<5-10,ROMAN>卡梅说是他老朋友了
<5-10,ROMAN>Well, Cam said he was an old friend, right?

154
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,490
<5-10,ROMAN>但我看他们不像很友好的样子
<5-10,ROMAN>But they didn't look too friendly to me.

155
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,410
<5-10,ROMAN>卡梅看见他时脸都白了
<5-10,ROMAN>When Cam saw him, he went pale.

156
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:24,940
<5-10,ROMAN>于是他出去和他交谈
<5-10,ROMAN>So he stepped outside to talk.

157
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,800
<5-10,ROMAN>听起来吵得挺凶
<5-10,ROMAN>And it sounded pretty heated.

158
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:27,810
<5-11,ESPOSITO>你知道他们在说什么吗
<5-11,ESPOSITO>You know what it was about?

159
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:30,460
<5-12,ROMAN>没有  但我听到他提到了坐牢的事
<5-12,ROMAN>No, but I heard the guy say something about going to prison.

160
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,840
<5-12,ROMAN>卡梅回来时很慌乱
<5-12,ROMAN>When Cam came back inside, he was rattled.

161
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:35,740
<5-12,ROMAN>那个人走前告诉卡梅  他还会回来
<5-12,ROMAN>And before that guy left, he told Cam that he'd be coming back.

162
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:36,940
<5-13,RYAN>那人又出现了吗
<5-13,RYAN>This guy show up again?

163
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,080
<5-14,ROMAN>没有  但我觉得卡梅害怕他
<5-14,ROMAN>Nah, but I got the feeling Cam was scared of him.

164
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,700
<5-14,ROMAN>因为一般情况下他凌晨三点
<5-14,ROMAN>Because normally he'd come back to the garage

165
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,810
<5-14,ROMAN>会回车库休息
<5-14,ROMAN>for his 3:00 a.m. lunch break.

166
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:43,240
<5-14,ROMAN>但自从那人出现后
<5-14,ROMAN>But since that guy showed up,

167
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,230
<5-14,ROMAN>他就会整晚在外面
<5-14,ROMAN>he'd be staying out all night,

168
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:45,860
<5-14,ROMAN>好像害怕回这里似的
<5-14,ROMAN>like he was scared to come back here.

169
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,160
<5-15,RYAN>这个人  你能描述他的外貌吗
<5-15,RYAN>This guy-- can you describe him?

170
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:51,070
<5-16,ROMAN>我没看到他的脸
<5-16,ROMAN>I didn't really get a look at his face.

171
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,280
<5-16,ROMAN>但是  我记起来了
<5-16,ROMAN>But oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

172
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:54,260
<5-16,ROMAN>他手臂上有一处纹身
<5-16,ROMAN>He had this, uh, tattoo on his arm.

173
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,350
<5-16,ROMAN>很显眼
<5-16,ROMAN>It was pretty spectacular.

174
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:58,180
<5-16,ROMAN>是一头露出牙齿的狼  对着月亮咆哮
<5-16,ROMAN>It was a wolf--teeth bared-- howling at a moon.

175
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:02,370
<6-1,BECKETT>咆哮狼纹身  还真挺具体的
<6-1,BECKETT>Wow, a howling wolf tattoo? That's pretty specific.

176
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,430
<6-3,BECKETT>如果这家伙服过刑  在监狱纹身数据库里
<6-3,BECKETT>If this guy did time, there should be a record of it

177
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,670
<6-3,BECKETT>应该会有记录
<6-3,BECKETT>in the prison tattoo database.

178
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,530
<6-4,RYAN>埃斯波西托在查了  知道这婴儿是谁家的吗
<6-4,RYAN>Esposito's checking right now. Any idea whose kid this is?

<6-5,BECKETT>没有失踪婴儿的报告
<6-5,BECKETT>Uh, there's no reports of any missing babies.

180
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,590
<6-6,RYAN>好吧  那死者呢
<6-6,RYAN>Okay, how about our victim?

181
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:15,270
<6-7,BECKETT>他之前有几张超速驾驶罚单
<6-7,BECKETT>Well, aside from a handful of speeding tickets

182
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:17,040
<6-7,BECKETT>除此之外没什么案底
<6-7,BECKETT>back in the day, he's clean.

183
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,160
<6-7,BECKETT>他所有的朋友都说他很沉默
<6-7,BECKETT>All of his friends say that he was quiet,

184
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:22,030
<6-7,BECKETT>努力工作  对妻子十分忠诚
<6-7,BECKETT>he was hard-working, and completely devoted to his wife.

185
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:24,720
<6-8,RYAN>他晚上十点去上班  但没到公司
<6-8,RYAN>Huh. Guy takes off for work at 10:00 p.m. and never arrives.

186
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,750
<6-8,RYAN>然后第二天早上6点45
<6-8,RYAN>And then at 6:45 the next morning,

187
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,940

00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:33,080
<6-8,RYAN>这八个小时内发生了什么
<6-8,RYAN>What the hell happened during those eight hours?

202
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,000
<6-17,BECKETT>我突然清楚地看见了
<6-17,BECKETT>I'm suddenly getting a clear and frightening visual

203
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,680
<6-17,BECKETT>我未来的恐怖景象
<6-17,BECKETT>as to what my future will look like.

<6-18,RYAN>卡塞尔  能让我抱抱他吗
<6-18,RYAN>Hey, Castle, um, mind if I... hold him?

<6-26,CASTLE>尽量保持冷静  他们能感觉到恐惧
<6-26,CASTLE>Just try to remain calm. They can sense fear.

212
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:35,040
<6-27,RYAN>这跟练习娃娃可完全不同
<6-27,RYAN>This is not at all like the practice doll.

213
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,930
<6-28,RYAN>我以为我准备好了
<6-28,RYAN>I thought I was ready.

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,660
<6-30,CASTLE>我是婴语者
<6-30,CASTLE>I'm the baby whisperer.

00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,710
<6-31,CASTLE>想抱抱他吗

221
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:59,180
<6-32,BECKETT>不想  我宁愿查清楚他是从哪来的
<6-32,BECKETT>Uh, no. I'd rather figure out where he came from.

222
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,810
<6-33,CASTLE>-当我...  -闭嘴
<6-33,CASTLE>- Well, when a m-- - Stop.

<6-34,BECKETT>Stop. I know where babies come from, Castle.

224
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,200
<6-34,BECKETT>只是  不知道他哪来的
<6-34,BECKETT>Just... not this one.

225
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,630
<6-35,BECKETT>你怎么会不想抱他啊
<6-35,BECKETT>I can't believe you don't want to hold the baby.

226
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:07,120
<6-35,BECKETT>大家都喜欢抱婴儿啊
<6-35,BECKETT>Everyone wants to hold the baby.

<6-36,ESPOSITO>我不想抱他
<6-36,ESPOSITO>I don't want to hold that baby.

228

<6-37,ESPOSITO>监狱纹身数据库有匹配
<6-37,ESPOSITO>So I got a hit in the, uh, prison tattoo database.

229
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:12,930
<6-37,ESPOSITO>看看吧
<6-37,ESPOSITO>Check it out.

230
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:15,220
<6-38,BECKETT>和罗曼描述的一样
<6-38,BECKETT>Just like Roman described it.

231
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,850
<6-39,ESPOSITO>是啊  纹身的主人是吉米·沃夫斯基
<6-39,ESPOSITO>Yep. Belongs to one Jimmy Wolfinsky--

232
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:18,910
<6-39,ESPOSITO>又名野狼吉米
<6-39,ESPOSITO>A.K.A. "Jimmy the wolf."

233
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:21,700
<6-39,ESPOSITO>是多起银行和珠宝抢劫的嫌疑犯
<6-39,ESPOSITO>Suspected in a handful of bank and jewelry jobs.

234
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,480
<6-39,ESPOSITO>七年前  他抢劫银行时
<6-39,ESPOSITO>He was arrested seven years ago

235
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,660
<6-39,ESPOSITO>被抓  随后被判刑
<6-39,ESPOSITO>and convicted when a bank robbery went south.

236
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,130
<6-39,ESPOSITO>他两周前刚被保释
<6-39,ESPOSITO>He just got paroled two weeks ago.

237
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,830
<6-40,BECKETT>他和死者有何联系
<6-40,BECKETT>Any connection to our victim?

238
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:31,020
<6-41,ESPOSITO>他抢的那家银行
<6-41,ESPOSITO>Well, the bank that he robbed--

239
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:31,980
<6-41,ESPOSITO>吉米本可以逃走的
<6-41,ESPOSITO>Jimmy would have gotten away,

240
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,210
<6-41,ESPOSITO>但当他走出大楼时
<6-41,ESPOSITO>but when he came outside the building,

241
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:34,920
<6-41,ESPOSITO>他的逃亡汽车已经开走了
<6-41,ESPOSITO>his getaway car was gone.

242
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,770
<6-41,ESPOSITO>警铃大作时  吉米的同伙溜走了
<6-41,ESPOSITO>Jimmy's partner bolted when the alarm sounded.

243
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:38,570
<6-41,ESPOSITO>警察没抓到他  吉米也没有招供
<6-41,ESPOSITO>Cops never caught him, and Jimmy never ratted.

244
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:40,620
<6-41,ESPOSITO>但是  目击证人画出了
<6-41,ESPOSITO>But... witnesses were able to provide a sketch

245
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,480
<6-41,ESPOSITO>逃亡司机的草图  看起来眼熟吗
<6-41,ESPOSITO>of the getaway driver. Look familiar?

246
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,320
<6-42,CASTLE>那是死者卡梅隆·杜卡恩
<6-42,CASTLE>That's Cameron Ducane-- our victim.

247
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:49,680
<6-43,ESPOSITO>我们性情温和的豪车司机有过犯罪历史
<6-43,ESPOSITO>Our mild-mannered limo driver had a criminal past.

248
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,840
<6-44,BECKETT>看来过去的事找上了他
<6-44,BECKETT>Looks like that past just caught up with him.

258
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:03,490
<7-1,CASTLE>原来这是个背叛和复仇的故事
<7-1,CASTLE>So... it's a tale of betrayal and revenge.

259
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,260
<7-1,CASTLE>当吉米被抓时
<7-1,CASTLE>Cameron abandons his partner Jimmy

260
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,420
<7-1,CASTLE>卡梅隆抛弃了他的同伙  让他承担责任
<7-1,CASTLE>when he comes down, leaving him to take the fall.

261
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:11,470
<7-1,CASTLE>卡梅隆满怀内疚  想把过去的事情抛诸脑后
<7-1,CASTLE>Ridden with remorse, Cameron tries to put it all behind him,

262
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:12,890
<7-1,CASTLE>重新开始生活
<7-1,CASTLE>start his life anew.

263
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,830
<7-1,CASTLE>但是突然
<7-1,CASTLE>But surprise, surprise,

264
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:17,010
<7-1,CASTLE>吉米保释了
<7-1,CASTLE>Jimmy made parole,

265
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:18,890
<7-1,CASTLE>而他足足想了七年
<7-1,CASTLE>after spending seven long years

266
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:20,770
<7-1,CASTLE>如何要让自己的老搭档付出代价
<7-1,CASTLE>thinking of ways to make his old partner pay.

267
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:22,160
<7-2,RYAN>难怪卡梅隆加了锁
<7-2,RYAN>No wonder Cameron was adding locks.

268
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:23,570
<7-3,CASTLE>他不想告诉妻子这件事
<7-3,CASTLE>He didn't want to tell his wife about it,

269
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:25,460
<7-3,CASTLE>因为他不想让她知道自己的犯罪历史
<7-3,CASTLE>because he didn't want her to know about is criminal past.

270
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,980
<7-4,BECKETT>这推论很不错  卡塞尔
<7-4,BECKETT>That's a great theory, Castle,

271
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:29,470
<7-4,BECKETT>不过这婴儿是哪来的
<7-4,BECKETT>except where did the baby come from?

272
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,370
<7-5,CASTLE>也许...
<7-5,CASTLE>Ah. Maybe...

273
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:34,960
<7-5,CASTLE>我一点思路也没有
<7-5,CASTLE>Nope, I got nothing. Hmm.

274
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,060
<7-6,ESPOSITO>我刚和野狼吉米的保释官谈过了
<7-6,ESPOSITO>I just talked Jimmy the wolf's parole officer.

275
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,430
<7-6,ESPOSITO>吉米在皇后区有间公寓
<7-6,ESPOSITO>Jimmy's got an apartment in Queens.

276
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,170
<7-7,BECKETT>好吧  去那里看看能不能找到他
<7-7,BECKETT>Okay. Head up there. See if you can track him down.

277
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:42,650
<7-7,BECKETT>不管昨晚发生了什么  他都参与其中了
<7-7,BECKETT>Whatever happened last night-- he was a part of it.

278
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,560
<7-8,CASTLE>别担心  小科斯莫  这些警察是最出色的
<7-8,CASTLE>Don't you worry, little Cosmo. These guys are the best.

279
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,570
<7-8,CASTLE>如果有谁能找到你的父母  那就是他们
<7-8,CASTLE>If anyone can find your folks, it's them.

280
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:50,970
<7-9,BECKETT>不过我们又和医院  联调局以及国家失踪儿童中心
<7-9,BECKETT>Except we have double-checked with hospitals, the F.B.I.,

281
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:53,890
<7-9,BECKETT>复核过了  一无所获
<7-9,BECKETT>and the N.C.M.E.C., and nothing.

282
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,410
<7-9,BECKETT>如果有人丢了孩子
<7-9,BECKETT>If someone was missing their baby,

283
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,530
<7-9,BECKETT>难道不会报案吗
<7-9,BECKETT>wouldn't they have come forward?

284
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,360
<7-10,CASTLE>也许他们不知道他失踪了
<7-10,CASTLE>Maybe they don't know he's gone...

285
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:01,140
<7-11,BECKETT>也许他们都死了
<7-11,BECKETT>Or maybe they're not alive.

286
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,960
<7-11,BECKETT>我们也不知道那晚发生了什么
<7-11,BECKETT>I mean, we don't know what happened that night.

287
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,260
<7-12,LANIE>不管发生了什么  都发生在那座教堂附近
<7-12,LANIE>Well, whatever happened, happened near that church.

288
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:08,490
<7-13,BECKETT>蕾妮  你来干什么
<7-13,BECKETT>Lanie, what are you doing here?

289
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:11,110
<7-14,LANIE>我有些线索  想着过来
<7-14,LANIE>I had some information. I thought I'd come by

290
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:13,900
<7-14,LANIE>看看我的小病人
<7-14,LANIE>and check on my little patient.

291
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:16,800
<7-14,LANIE>嗨  小甲虫
<7-14,LANIE>Hi, you little doodle bug.

292
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,690
<7-15,BECKETT>你好吗
<7-15,BECKETT>How you doin'?

293
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:21,220
<7-15,BECKETT>你为什么觉得卡梅隆是在教堂附近中枪的
<7-15,BECKETT>What makes you think Cameron was shot near the church?

294
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,730
<7-16,LANIE>根据伤口的性质和
<7-16,LANIE>Well, based on the nature and the severity

295
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:25,940
<7-16,LANIE>严重程度  死者中弹后可能只活了
<7-16,LANIE>of the wounds, your victim maybe had

296
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:28,650
<7-16,LANIE>五到十分钟  就流血身亡了
<7-16,LANIE>only five or ten minutes before he bled out.

297
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:30,440
<7-17,CASTLE>他没法开车开那么远
<7-17,CASTLE>He couldn't have driven that far.

298
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:32,050
<7-18,LANIE>最多20个街区
<7-18,LANIE>20 blocks at most.

299
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:35,400
<7-18,LANIE>我还在他的指甲下发现了特别的东西
<7-18,LANIE>I also found something unusual under his fingernails.

300
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,610
<7-18,LANIE>蜡渣  烧焦的硝化纤维
<7-18,LANIE>Wax residue, charred nitrocellulose...

301
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:41,070
<7-18,LANIE>和樟脑
<7-18,LANIE>and camphor.

302
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,960
<7-19,BECKETT>-硝化纤维  -对
<7-19,BECKETT>- Nitrocellulose? - Yes.

304
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,670
<7-20,LANIE>是用来做赛璐珞的
<7-20,LANIE>It's used to make celluloid.

305
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:47,330
<7-20,LANIE>老库存胶片中有
<7-20,LANIE>You can find it in old film stock,

306
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:51,050
<7-20,LANIE>还有一些塑料  但极其易燃
<7-20,LANIE>certain kinds of plastic, but it's highly flammable.

307
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:53,480
<7-20,LANIE>-对吧  -烧焦的赛璐珞
<7-20,LANIE>- Isn't it? - Charred celluloid--

308
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,530
<7-21,CASTLE>那是哪来的啊
<7-21,CASTLE>Where would that come from?

309
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:56,230
<7-22,LANIE>我可不知道  那是你的工作
<7-22,LANIE>Beats me. That's your job.

310
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:59,890
<7-22,LANIE>现在我的工作就是和小宝宝一起玩
<7-22,LANIE>Right now my job is to play with the little baby.

311
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,380
<7-22,LANIE>是啊
<7-22,LANIE>Yes, it is!

312
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,620
<8-1,ESPOSITO>吉米的公寓里没人
<8-1,ESPOSITO>Jimmy's apartment is empty,

313
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,140
<8-1,ESPOSITO>房东好几天都没看见他了
<8-1,ESPOSITO>and his landlord hasn't seen him in days.

314
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:08,600
<8-2,RYAN>如果他杀了卡梅隆
<8-2,RYAN>Well, if he killed Cameron,

315
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,970
<8-2,RYAN>现在可能在逃往墨西哥的路上了
<8-2,RYAN>he's probably halfway to Mexico by now.

316
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:11,730
<8-3,ESPOSITO>好吧  我会发一则通告
<8-3,ESPOSITO>All right, I'll put out a B.O.L.O. on him,

317
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:12,950
<8-3,ESPOSITO>询问一下他的保释官
<8-3,ESPOSITO>check in with his parole officer,

318
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:14,750
<8-3,ESPOSITO>看他有没有已知亲友的名单
<8-3,ESPOSITO>see if he's got a list of known associates.

319
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,870
<8-3,ESPOSITO>他刚刚从牢里放出来
<8-3,ESPOSITO>He just got out of prison.

320
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:18,010
<8-3,ESPOSITO>如果要逃跑  一定需要人帮忙
<8-3,ESPOSITO>If he's on the run, he's gonna need some help.

322
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:19,610
<8-3,ESPOSITO>没错  是啊  你先忙着
<8-3,ESPOSITO>Yeah. Yeah, yeah, and, uh, while you do that,

323
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:20,460
<8-4,RYAN>我去去就来
<8-4,RYAN>I'm gonna duck inside.

324
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:22,010
<8-4,RYAN>彩票在召唤我呢
<8-4,RYAN>I feel a quick pick calling my name.

325
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,350
<8-5,ESPOSITO>你不是吧
<8-5,ESPOSITO>Are you serious?

326
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:24,710
<8-6,RYAN>就两分钟  很快的
<8-6,RYAN>Two minutes, okay?

327
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,960
<8-7,ESPOSITO>孩子还未出世  你就拿奶粉钱去赌博吗
<8-7,ESPOSITO>Two minutes to fritter away your unborn child's future?

328
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:29,280
<8-8,RYAN>与其说是赌博  不如说是投资
<8-8,RYAN>Frittering or investing?

329
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,410
<8-9,ESPOSITO>你好  我是埃斯波西托探员
<8-9,ESPOSITO>Yo, this is detective Esposito.

330
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:34,820
<8-9,ESPOSITO>我要发一则通告  名字叫吉米·沃夫
<8-9,ESPOSITO>I need to put out a B.O.L.O. On a Jimmy Wolfins--

331
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,160
<8-9,ESPOSITO>不用了  我发现他了
<8-9,ESPOSITO>Never mind. I think I found him.

332
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,190
<8-10,ESPOSITO>你好啊  吉米
<8-10,ESPOSITO>Yo, Jimmy!

333
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:45,110
<8-11,ESPOSITO>别跑
<8-11,ESPOSITO>Come here.

334
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:48,170
<9-1,RYAN>49
<9-1,RYAN>49...

00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:49,580
<9-1,RYAN>9
<9-1,RYAN>9...

336
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,000
<9-1,RYAN>36
<9-1,RYAN>36...

337
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,130
<9-1,RYAN>你往哪跑啊  伙计
<9-1,RYAN>Where you running to, pal?

338
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,170
<9-1,RYAN>厉害啊  看到没
<9-1,RYAN>Hey! See?

339
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,890
<11-1,RYAN>我就说这是个幸运的地方
<11-1,RYAN>I knew this place was lucky.

340
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,390
<11-1,RYAN>走吧
<11-1,RYAN>Come on.

341
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:11,720
<11-1,RYAN>看到那个家伙了吗
<11-1,RYAN>Hmm, see that man?

342
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,340
<11-1,RYAN>那是一个坏人
<11-1,RYAN>That is a bad man.

343
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,530
<11-1,RYAN>他会把事情交代清楚
<11-1,RYAN>He's gonna confess.

344
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:18,170
<12-1,CASTLE>我们就能知道你是谁啦
<12-1,CASTLE>Then we're gonna know just who you are.

345
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:19,990
<12-2,RYAN>卡塞尔  我可以再试一次吗
<12-2,RYAN>Castle, mind if I try again?

346
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:20,560
<12-2,RYAN>当然可以啦
<12-2,RYAN>Of course.

347
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:21,910
<12-3,CASTLE>给你
<12-3,CASTLE>Here you go. Hey.

348
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,980
<12-4,RYAN>我想了想  还是在外面等吧
<12-4,RYAN>On second thought, I'll just wait outside.

349
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:34,540
<12-5,CASTLE>好吧
<12-5,CASTLE>No problem.

350
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,990
<12-5,CASTLE>-他真可爱  -是啊
<12-5,CASTLE>- He's cute. - Yeah.

351
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,910
<12-6,CASTLE>你是故意的是吗  小坏蛋
<12-6,CASTLE>You did that on purpose, didn't you?

352
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:43,520
<12-6,CASTLE>来击个掌吧  干得好
<12-6,CASTLE>High five. Good job.

353
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,640
<13-1,BECKETT>沃夫斯基先生
<13-1,BECKETT>Mr. Wolfinsky,

354
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,420
<13-1,BECKETT>这个人你认识吗
<13-1,BECKETT>Do you recognize this man?

355
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,340
<13-2,JIMMY>从来没见过
<13-2,JIMMY>Never seen him before in my life.

356
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,140
<13-2,JIMMY>是吗
<13-2,JIMMY>Really?

357
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,820
<13-3,BECKETT>我倒觉得他很像你的老搭档
<13-3,BECKETT>I think he looks a lot like your old partner--

358
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,710
<13-3,BECKETT>七年前抢银行的时候
<13-3,BECKETT>The one who left you to get busted

359
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,850
<13-3,BECKETT>他丢下你一人  害你被捕
<13-3,BECKETT>at that bank job seven years ago.

360
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,070
<13-4,JIMMY>一点印象也没有
<13-4,JIMMY>Doesn't ring a bell.

361
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,150
<14-1,CASTLE>这是一个熟练的谎话精
<14-1,CASTLE>That's a grown-up lying.

362
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,310
<14-1,CASTLE>你以后会见到很多呢
<14-1,CASTLE>Get used to that.

363
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,980
<14-1,CASTLE>那感觉肯定天天侵蚀着你吧
<14-1,CASTLE>Must have ate at ya, huh?

364
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:07,360
<14-1,CASTLE>在牢房里熬过一天又一天
<14-1,CASTLE>All those nights in the joint.

365
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:09,080
<14-1,CASTLE>你在里面吃苦受罪
<14-1,CASTLE>Knowing you were in there rotting away,

366
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,040
<15-1,ESPOSITO>他却在外面自由自在
<15-1,ESPOSITO>while he was out there free

367
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,510
<15-1,ESPOSITO>就因为那天他把你扔在了银行
<15-1,ESPOSITO>because he ditched you at the bank.

368
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:15,770
<15-2,JIMMY>我跟检察官说过了  我没有同伙
<15-2,JIMMY>Like I told the D.A., I didn't have a partner.

369
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,130
<15-2,JIMMY>就算有  我也不会做叛徒
<15-2,JIMMY>And if I did, I ain't no rat.

370
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:19,610
<15-3,BECKETT>不做叛徒
<15-3,BECKETT>What about...

371
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:21,550
<15-3,BECKETT>做杀人犯吗
<15-3,BECKETT>a murderer?

372
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,030
<15-4,JIMMY>卡梅死了吗
<15-4,JIMMY>Cam's dead?

373
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,280
<15-5,ESPOSITO>这么说你们认识喽
<15-5,ESPOSITO>So you do know him?

374
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,760
<15-6,JIMMY>是认识  但这事跟我一点关系也没有
<15-6,JIMMY>Yeah, okay, but I had nothing to do with this.

375
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,200
<15-7,BECKETT>你假释出狱那天  他给家里装了安全系统
<15-7,BECKETT>The day you make parole, he installs a security system,

376
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,880
<15-7,BECKETT>门上添了新锁
<15-7,BECKETT>gets all new locks.

377
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:34,210
<15-7,BECKETT>他为什么要这么做
<15-7,BECKETT>Now why would he do that?

378
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,320
<15-8,JIMMY>因为  我也不知道  我被判刑的时候
<15-8,JIMMY>Because... I don't know, when I was convicted,

379
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,240
<15-8,JIMMY>可能跟人说过会让他付出代价的话
<15-8,JIMMY>I may have told some folks that, uh, Cam will pay.

380
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,690
<15-8,JIMMY>但那都过去多少年了
<15-8,JIMMY>But that was years ago.

381
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,020
<15-8,JIMMY>听着  实际上
<15-8,JIMMY>Look, the truth is,

382
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,590
<15-8,JIMMY>那天搞砸的人是我
<15-8,JIMMY>I was the one who messed up that day.

383
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:46,690
<15-8,JIMMY>我在银行里耽误了时间
<15-8,JIMMY>I got hung up inside.

384
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:48,810
<15-8,JIMMY>卡梅已经尽可能地等我了
<15-8,JIMMY>Cam waited as long as he could--

385
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:50,050
<15-8,JIMMY>他其实早就该走了
<15-8,JIMMY>Longer than he should've.

386
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,940
<15-8,JIMMY>我跟他讲过这话  他知道我不记恨他
<15-8,JIMMY>I told him that. He knew we were square.

387
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,680
<15-9,ESPOSITO>卡梅的同事可不是这么说的
<15-9,ESPOSITO>Witnesses at Cam's work say otherwise.

388
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:56,320
<15-9,ESPOSITO>他说你们两个吵过架  而且在那之后
<15-9,ESPOSITO>Said you two were fighting, that afterwards...

389
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:58,910
<15-9,ESPOSITO>他晚上都不敢回车库
<15-9,ESPOSITO>Cam was scared to come back to the garage at night.

390
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:02,320
<15-10,JIMMY>什么  才不是呢  我在尝试开始新生活
<15-10,JIMMY>What? Nah, it's just, I'm trying to get my life together,

391
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,250
<15-10,JIMMY>就像他那样
<15-10,JIMMY>like he did.

392
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,920
<15-10,JIMMY>我本想让他在老板面前说说好话
<15-10,JIMMY>I thought maybe he could put in a word with his boss,

393
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,180
<15-10,JIMMY>帮我找个司机的工作
<15-10,JIMMY>help me get a job driving.

394
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,200
<15-11,ESPOSITO>那就有意思了
<15-11,ESPOSITO>Well, that's funny.

395
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:09,120
<15-11,ESPOSITO>目击者说你们的谈话后来升级为争吵
<15-11,ESPOSITO>'cause witnesses say that the conversation was heated.

396
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,410
<15-12,JIMMY>因为他不肯帮我
<15-12,JIMMY>Because he wouldn't help me.

397
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:11,730
<15-12,JIMMY>他说不想再跟我有任何瓜葛了
<15-12,JIMMY>He told me he couldn't be around me anymore,

398
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:13,350
<15-12,JIMMY>他不想再跟过去有什么牵连
<15-12,JIMMY>that that part of his life was over.

399
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:14,550
<15-12,JIMMY>毕竟他还欠我一个人情
<15-12,JIMMY>After all I'd done for him,

400
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:15,270
<15-12,JIMMY>当年我没把他供出来
<15-12,JIMMY>keeping my mouth shut

401
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:17,530
<15-12,JIMMY>过了这些年  他连句好话也不肯替我说
<15-12,JIMMY>All those years, he couldn't even put in a good word?

402
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,700
<15-12,JIMMY>那是我最后一次见他
<15-12,JIMMY>That's the last I saw of him.

403
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,830
<15-13,BECKETT>沃夫斯基先生  昨天晚上你在哪
<15-13,BECKETT>Mr. Wolfinksy, where were you last night?

404
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,740
<15-14,JIMMY>跟我女友在泽西
<15-14,JIMMY>I was with my girlfriend out in Jersey.

405
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:27,950
<15-14,JIMMY>我整个礼拜都跟她在一起
<15-14,JIMMY>I've been with her all week.

406
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,230
<15-15,ESPOSITO>那么今天早上呢  六点到七点之间
<15-15,ESPOSITO>What about this morning, between 6:00 and 7:00?

407
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,580
<15-16,JIMMY>我们在一家餐厅吃早饭
<15-16,JIMMY>We were having breakfast at a diner.

408
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,320
<15-16,JIMMY>在场的人可以作证
<15-16,JIMMY>People saw us.

409
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,400
<15-16,JIMMY>听着  我发誓不是我干的
<15-16,JIMMY>Look, I swear this wasn't me.

410
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,210
<15-17,BECKETT>你以前见过这个婴儿吗
<15-17,BECKETT>Have you ever seen this baby before?

411
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:39,940
<15-17,BECKETT>没有
<15-17,BECKETT>No.

412
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,550
<15-18,JIMMY>婴儿跟这事有什么关系
<15-18,JIMMY>What's a baby gotta do with this?

413
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,580
<16-3,BECKETT>他说的是实话
<16-3,BECKETT>Well, he's telling the truth.

414
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,530
<16-1,RYAN>根据他女朋友和室友的证词
<16-1,RYAN>According to his girlfriend and a roommate,

415
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,140
<16-1,RYAN>过去几天  他一直待在他们泽西的公寓里
<16-1,RYAN>he spent the last few days at their apartment in Jersey.

416
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,160
<16-2,ESPOSITO>餐厅的服务员也证实
<16-2,ESPOSITO>And a waitress at that diner

417
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:52,790
<16-2,ESPOSITO>案发的时候他确实在那儿
<16-2,ESPOSITO>places him there during the shooting window.

418
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:54,480
<16-3,BECKETT>好吧  如果吉米说的是实话
<16-3,BECKETT>Okay, well, if Jimmy was telling the truth,

419
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,030
<16-3,BECKETT>那卡梅没理由害怕他啊
<16-3,BECKETT>then Cam didn't have any reason to be afraid of him.

420
00:15:57,030 --> 00:16:01,110
<16-4,CASTLE>他为什么不敢在3点休息的时候回车库呢
<16-4,CASTLE>And why was he avoiding the limo garage 3:00 a.m. lunch break?

421
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:03,570
<16-5,BECKETT>也许他不是不敢去
<16-5,BECKETT>Maybe he wasn't avoiding it.

422
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,610
<16-5,BECKETT>而是因为别的事情
<16-5,BECKETT>Maybe something else was going on.

423
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,870
<16-5,BECKETT>大部分的豪车公司都会在车上配备定位装置
<16-5,BECKETT>Most limo companies use G.P.S. Services to track their vehicles.

424
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:11,790
<16-5,BECKETT>也许能查到卡梅那些晚上去了哪里
<16-5,BECKETT>Maybe they can tell us where Cam was going all those nights.

425
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:12,580
<16-6,ESPOSITO>这就去找
<16-6,ESPOSITO>On it.

426
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:16,050
<16-7,SANDRA WHITMAN>打扰一下  是贝克特探长吗
<16-7,SANDRA WHITMAN>Uh, excuse me, Detective Beckett?

427
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:17,190
<16-8,BECKETT>-我是   -你好
<16-8,BECKETT>- Yeah. - Hi.

428
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:18,830
<16-9,SANDRA>我是桑德拉·惠特曼  儿童福利中心的
<16-9,SANDRA>Sandra Whitman-- child services.

429
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:20,720
<16-9,SANDRA>很抱歉我来晚了
<16-9,SANDRA>Sorry it took me so long to get here.

430
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,410
<16-9,SANDRA>每年这个时候总是特别忙
<16-9,SANDRA>This time of year is always bad.

431
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:23,880
<16-10,BECKETT>没关系  不要紧
<16-10,BECKETT>Oh, no, uh, not a problem.

432
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,250
<16-10,BECKETT>宝宝在休息室
<16-10,BECKETT>He's right in the lounge.

433
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,420
<16-11,SANDRA>好的  谢谢
<16-11,SANDRA>Oh, great, thanks.

434
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,620
<16-12,CASTLE>你们打算拿他怎么办
<16-12,CASTLE>Um, uh... what's gonna happen to him?

435
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,480
<16-13,SANDRA>郡相关机构床位已经满了
<16-13,SANDRA>County facilities don't currently have any beds.

436
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,590
<16-13,SANDRA>我们会帮他找一个寄养家庭
<16-13,SANDRA>So we're working to find a foster family to take him.

437
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,240
<16-13,SANDRA>等安排好了就通知你们
<16-13,SANDRA>I'll let you know as soon as we do.

438
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:35,750
<16-14,CASTLE>谢谢
<16-14,CASTLE>Thank you.

439
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,380
<16-15,CASTLE>我们也许不该把他交给陌生人
<16-15,CASTLE>I don't know if we should just be handing him over to strangers.

440
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,790
<16-16,BECKETT>卡塞尔  今早之前我们对他来说也是陌生人呢
<16-16,BECKETT>Castle, we were strangers until this morning.

441
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:48,340
<16-17,CASTLE>面对那么一张小脸  你怎么还这么理性啊
<16-17,CASTLE>How can you be logical in the face of that face?

442
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,610
<16-18,BECKETT>因为我必须这样
<16-18,BECKETT>Well, because I have to be.

443
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:51,670
<16-18,BECKETT>我们也不知道科斯莫最后会怎么样
<16-18,BECKETT>I mean, we don't know what's gonna happen to Cosmo.

444
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:53,120
<16-18,BECKETT>不能投入太多感情
<16-18,BECKETT>We can't get attached.

445
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:55,860
<16-19,CASTLE>所以你才一直不肯抱他吗
<16-19,CASTLE>Is that why you won't hold him?

446
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:56,770
<16-19,CASTLE>是的
<16-19,CASTLE>Yes.

447
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,800
<16-20,BECKETT>好吧  我坦白
<16-20,BECKETT>Okay. Fine.

448
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,230
<16-20,BECKETT>我一直不太喜欢孩子
<16-20,BECKETT>I've never really been a baby person.

449
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,960
<16-20,BECKETT>有些人一看见宝宝
<16-20,BECKETT>I mean, some people see babies

450
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,830
<16-20,BECKETT>就想抱抱啊  啃啃小脚趾头啊什么的
<16-20,BECKETT>and they want to hold them, they want to nibble their toes,

451
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:09,980
<16-20,BECKETT>我从来都不像他们那样  所以
<16-20,BECKETT>and I've never been one of those people. So...

452
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,430
<16-21,CASTLE>我倒不知道你还有这一面
<16-21,CASTLE>I did not know that about you.

453
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,860
<16-21,CASTLE>你一定也讨厌彩虹吧
<16-21,CASTLE>I suppose you hate rainbows, too.

454
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,530
<16-22,BECKETT>我不讨厌宝宝  卡塞尔
<16-22,BECKETT>I don't hate babies, Castle.

455
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:21,320
<16-22,BECKETT>我只是没觉得他们那么可爱
<16-22,BECKETT>I just don't see the appeal.

456
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,450
<16-22,BECKETT>但等我们有了自己的孩子
<16-22,BECKETT>But I'm sure I'll feel differently

457
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:25,120
<16-22,BECKETT>我肯定会有所改变的
<16-22,BECKETT>when we have one of our own.

458
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:29,450
<16-23,CASTLE>是吗
<16-23,CASTLE>Will you?

459
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,830
<16-23,CASTLE>你会吗
<16-23,CASTLE>Will you?!

460
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,590
<17-1,RYAN>我们提取了之前六个晚上
<17-1,RYAN>Okay, so we pulled G.P.S. information

461
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:38,100
<17-1,RYAN>卡梅隆工作期间的定位信息
<17-1,RYAN>from the past six nights that Cameron was at work,

462
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,920
<17-1,RYAN>没发现有什么异常
<17-1,RYAN>and nothing out of the ordinary.

463
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,890
<17-2,ESPOSITO>但是他休息的时候就不一样了
<17-2,ESPOSITO>Until we took a look at his lunch hour.

464
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:43,800
<17-2,ESPOSITO>-你看  -每天凌晨三点
<17-2,ESPOSITO>- Check it out. - Every night at 3:00 a.m...

465
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,450
<17-3,RYAN>他交班之后  都会开往这里
<17-3,RYAN>he'd go off shift, and he would drive here.

467
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:47,780
<17-4,BECKETT>市中心的考弗斯大厦
<17-4,BECKETT>The Colfax building downtown?

468
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,750
<17-5,ESPOSITO>但他不会待很久  看着
<17-5,ESPOSITO>But he wouldn't stay long. Watch.

469
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,810
<17-6,RYAN>每天晚上  他都会开往同一个地方
<17-6,RYAN>Every night, he would drive to the same destination...

470
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:53,610
<17-6,RYAN>位于字母城的一个街区
<17-6,RYAN>A block in Alphabet City.

471
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:55,330
<17-7,ESPOSITO>每天晚上他都选择不同的路线
<17-7,ESPOSITO>Each night he would take a different route,

472
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:56,910
<17-7,ESPOSITO>一次又一次的重复尝试
<17-7,ESPOSITO>and he'd do it over and over again.

473
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:01,960
<17-8,RYAN>他这样的人干这种事
<17-8,RYAN>Only one reason I can think why someone like him

474
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,320
<17-8,RYAN>我只能想到一个原因
<17-8,RYAN>would be doing something like that.

475
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:06,090
<17-9,BECKETT>他是在练习逃跑路线
<17-9,BECKETT>He was practicing escape routes.

476
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,700
<17-9,BECKETT>卡梅又重操旧业了
<17-9,BECKETT>Cam was back in the life.

477
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,170
<17-9,BECKETT>他在计划逃跑
<17-9,BECKETT>He was planning a getaway.

478
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,310
<18-1,RYAN>我们看了考弗斯大厦的交通摄像头的录像
<18-1,RYAN>We scrubbed traffic cam footage from the Colfax Building

479
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:21,930
<18-1,RYAN>从那晚卡梅隆离开家开始
<18-1,RYAN>between the time Cameron left his house that night,

480
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:24,350
<18-1,RYAN>-到他到教堂为止  -我们在大厦后面
<18-1,RYAN>- to when he arrived at the church. - And we found this

481
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:25,620
<18-2,ESPOSITO>发现了这段录像
<18-2,ESPOSITO>behind the Colfax Building.

482
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:27,960
<18-3,BECKETT>那是他的车
<18-3,BECKETT>That's his car.

483
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,590
<18-4,ESPOSITO>有两个人跟他在一起
<18-4,ESPOSITO>Two guys are with him.

484
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,090
<18-5,CASTLE>凌晨3点57分
<18-5,CASTLE>3:57 a.m.

485
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:32,680
<18-5,CASTLE>他们带着那个箱子去哪
<18-5,CASTLE>Where are they going with that briefcase?

486
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,030
<18-6,RYAN>不知道  但是
<18-6,RYAN>Don't know, but then...

487
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,780
<18-6,RYAN>大概15分钟之后
<18-6,RYAN>about 15 minutes later...

488
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,740
<18-7,CASTLE>他们又出现了  同一个箱子
<18-7,CASTLE>Here they come. Same briefcase.

489
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:44,070
<18-7,CASTLE>这是一次抢劫...
<18-7,CASTLE>It's a heist...

490
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,250
<18-7,CASTLE>而卡梅是他们的司机
<18-7,CASTLE>And Cam is the wheelman.

491
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:49,150
<18-9,ESPOSITO>-那栋楼里有什么  -高级办公室
<18-9,ESPOSITO>- What's in the building? - Uh, high-end offices,

492
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:51,730
<18-9,ESPOSITO>珠宝店  房地产公司  还有律师事务所
<18-9,ESPOSITO>Jewelry store, real estate, and law offices,

493
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,340
<18-9,ESPOSITO>电视台  和几家银行
<18-9,ESPOSITO>The TV station, and a couple of banks.

494
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,310
<18-10,RYAN>我查过记录
<18-10,RYAN>I checked the blotter.

495
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:55,660
<18-10,RYAN>那个地址没有人上报
<18-10,RYAN>There were no reports of any break-ins

496
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,780
<18-10,RYAN>入室抢劫案
<18-10,RYAN>from anyone at that address.

497
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,690
<18-11,BECKETT>他们也许不知道他们被抢了
<18-11,BECKETT>Well, they might not know they have been hit.

498
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,500
<18-11,BECKETT>录像里有那个婴儿的迹象吗
<18-11,BECKETT>Is there any evidence of the baby in the footage?

499
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,760
<18-12,RYAN>没有  只有三个男人和一辆野马车
<18-12,RYAN>Nope. Only three men and a mustang.

500
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:05,550
<18-13,CASTLE>那科斯莫是从哪来的
<18-13,CASTLE>So where did Cosmo come from?

501
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:08,730
<18-14,BECKETT>一定是从卡梅隆凌晨4点12分
<18-14,BECKETT>Must be from wherever Cameron was between 4:12 a.m.

502
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,400
<18-14,BECKETT>到6点半他中枪之间去的地方来的
<18-14,BECKETT>and when he was shot at 6:30.

503
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,900
<18-14,BECKETT>盘查字母城
<18-14,BECKETT>Canvass the area in Alphabet City

504
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,450
<18-14,BECKETT>卡梅隆逃跑路线的终点
<18-14,BECKETT>where Cameron's practice route ended.

505
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:15,390
<18-14,BECKETT>看看能否找到那些人的老窝
<18-14,BECKETT>See if you can figure out where those guys were holed up.

506
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:17,440
<18-14,BECKETT>我和卡塞尔去考弗斯大厦
<18-14,BECKETT>Castle and I will head down to the Colfax Building.

507
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,500
<18-14,BECKETT>那里一定有人知道那些人拿走了什么
<18-14,BECKETT>Someone down there must know what these guys took.

508
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:22,180
<19-1,DENNIS>抱歉  探长  作为安全主管
<19-1,DENNIS>I'm sorry, Detective. As head of security,

509
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,860
<19-1,DENNIS>我跟所有的租客确认过
<19-1,DENNIS>I checked with all our tenants.

510
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,830
<19-1,DENNIS>据我们所知  什么都没丢
<19-1,DENNIS>As far as we can tell, nothing was taken.

511
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:28,010
<19-2,CASTLE>什么都没丢  你确定吗
<19-2,CASTLE>Well, nothing? Are you sure?

512
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:31,910
<19-3,BECKETT>丹尼斯先生  你们的安保系统如何
<19-3,BECKETT>Uh, Mr. Dennis, how--how's your security system?

513
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:32,890
<19-4,DENNIS>非常先进
<19-4,DENNIS>State of the art--

514
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:35,350
<19-4,DENNIS>全方位摄像头覆盖  运动检测器
<19-4,DENNIS>Good camera coverage, motion detectors.

515
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:37,260
<19-4,DENNIS>我们仔细检查了整个系统
<19-4,DENNIS>We double-checked all our systems.

516
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,960
<19-4,DENNIS>没有被切断的线  没有被触发的警报
<19-4,DENNIS>No wires were cut, no alarms were triggered,

517
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,280
<19-4,DENNIS>没有被呼叫的电梯
<19-4,DENNIS>No elevators called.

518
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:43,580
<19-4,DENNIS>就是没有任何有人进入大厦的迹象
<19-4,DENNIS>There's just no evidence of anyone entering the building.

519
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,390
<19-5,CASTLE>那你怎么解释这个
<19-5,CASTLE>Then how do you explain this?

520
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,310
<19-5,CASTLE>两个戴着面具的男人在凌晨四点
<19-5,CASTLE>Two masked guys entering your parking lot

521
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:48,960
<19-5,CASTLE>进入你们的停车场
<19-5,CASTLE>4:00 a.m.?

522
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,760
<19-6,DENNIS>我不知道
<19-6,DENNIS>I don't know.

523
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,210
<19-6,DENNIS>可能他们没能通过停车场的大门
<19-6,DENNIS>It's possible they never got past the parking gate

524
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,950
<19-6,DENNIS>然后就放弃了
<19-6,DENNIS>and just gave up.

525
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:57,730
<19-7,BECKETT>但我们还是需要检查
<19-7,BECKETT>Still, we're gonna need to examine

526
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:00,680
<19-7,BECKETT>-昨晚的所有监控录像  丹尼斯先生  -当然
<19-7,BECKETT>- all the surveillance from last night, mr. Dennis. - Of course.

527
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,150
<19-8,DENNIS>我再给你们一份租客名单
<19-8,DENNIS>I'll also get you a list of our tenants,

528
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:03,370
<19-8,DENNIS>如果你们想跟进的话
<19-8,DENNIS>if you want to follow up.

529
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:06,600
<19-9,CASTLE>一场什么都没拿的抢劫
<19-9,CASTLE>A heist where nothing was taken.

530
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,510
<19-9,CASTLE>也许这就是典型的
<19-9,CASTLE>Maybe this is a classic

531
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:10,640
<19-11,CASTLE>"盗而无道"的情况
<19-11,CASTLE>"no honor among thieves" situation.

532
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,980
<19-9,CASTLE>抢劫出了问题  他们打起来了
<19-9,CASTLE>You know, heist goes wrong, they fight.

533
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:15,970
<19-10,BECKETT>怎么会有人中枪后还带着个婴儿逃走
<19-10,BECKETT>Where someone gets shot running away with a baby?

534
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:19,860
<19-11,CASTLE>非典型"盗而无道"的情况吗
<19-11,CASTLE>Not-so-classic "no honor among thieves" situation?

535
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:20,810
<19-11,CASTLE>不
<19-11,CASTLE>No.

536
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,950
<20-1,RYAN>早些时候的事让我一直在想
<20-1,RYAN>Hey, earlier just got me thinking,

537
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:26,360
<20-1,RYAN>我们的孩子下个月就要生了
<20-1,RYAN>our baby's due in a month,

538
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:29,910
<20-1,RYAN>这我无法阻止  如果我还没准备好呢
<20-1,RYAN>And I can't stop it. What if I'm really not ready?

539
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:31,430
<20-2,ESPOSITO>你是没准备好
<20-2,ESPOSITO>Well, you're not ready.

540
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:34,000
<20-3,RYAN>-什么  -没人能准备好
<20-3,RYAN>- What? - Nobody is.

541
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:37,460
<20-4,ESPOSITO>听着  当爸爸就像当警察一样
<20-4,ESPOSITO>Look, being a dad is like being a cop.

542
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,610
<20-4,ESPOSITO>他们在警校里教你的是什么都没用
<20-4,ESPOSITO>It doesn't matter what they teach you in the academy,

543
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,110
<20-4,ESPOSITO>你在街上学的才有用  你干得挺好的吧
<20-4,ESPOSITO>you learn on the streets. You did okay with that, right?

544
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:45,830
<20-5,RYAN>我的第一天  我紧张得要死
<20-5,RYAN>Uh, my first day, I was so nervous,

545
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:47,090
<20-5,RYAN>我跟反恐特警组的车追尾了
<20-5,RYAN>I rear-ended a S.W.A.T. van,

546
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,540
<20-5,RYAN>然后十个穿着防弹背心的人冲出来
<20-5,RYAN>and ten guys in vests poured out,

547
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,720
<20-5,RYAN>打算直接把我放倒
<20-5,RYAN>ready to take me down with extreme prejudice.

548
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,490
<20-5,RYAN>好吧
<20-5,RYAN>Well...

549
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:56,740
<20-6,ESPOSITO>你很在乎
<20-6,ESPOSITO>You care.

550
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:00,570
<20-6,ESPOSITO>这已经让你比我爸爸要好一百倍了
<20-6,ESPOSITO>That already makes you a hundred times better than the dad I had.

551
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:03,660
<20-6,ESPOSITO>就是这里了
<20-6,ESPOSITO>This is it.

552
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:05,040
<20-6,ESPOSITO>这就是卡梅的路线的终点
<20-6,ESPOSITO>This is where Cam's route ended.

553
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:12,960
<20-7,RYAN>埃斯波  看看这个
<20-7,RYAN>Hey, Espo. Check it out.

554
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:14,340
<20-7,RYAN>一个弹孔
<20-7,RYAN>A bullet hole.

555
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:25,160
<21-1,ESPOSITO>这栋楼按计划在月底拆毁
<21-1,ESPOSITO>The building's scheduled to be torn down the end of the month.

556
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,590
<21-2,BECKETT>所以成了完美的藏身之处
<21-2,BECKETT>Making this a perfect hideout.

557
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:28,890
<21-3,RYAN>这里
<21-3,RYAN>Over here.

558
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:31,380
<21-3,RYAN>我们觉得杀卡梅的人是在这里开枪的
<21-3,RYAN>We think this is where Cam's killer fired from.

559
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:33,250
<21-4,BECKETT>那是火药残留吗
<21-4,BECKETT>Is that powder residue?

560
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,970
<21-5,RYAN>也许在冲卡梅隆开枪之前
<21-5,RYAN>Probably broke the window with his elbow

561
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:36,760
<21-5,RYAN>他用胳膊肘打破了窗户
<21-5,RYAN>before firing down at Cameron.

562
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:43,880
<21-6,BECKETT>这栋楼离教堂的距离开车只要五分钟
<21-6,BECKETT>This building is about a 5-minute drive to that church.

563
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,900
<21-7,CASTLE>这里最近有什么东西着火了
<21-7,CASTLE>Something caught fire here recently.

564
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,580
<21-7,CASTLE>就不久之前
<21-7,CASTLE>Very recently.

565
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,180
<21-8,ESPOSITO>这里还有打斗的痕迹
<21-8,ESPOSITO>There's also signs of a fight--

566
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:53,140
<21-8,ESPOSITO>墙上有四溅的血迹  不知道是谁的
<21-8,ESPOSITO>Blood spatter on the walls. Don't know whose.

567
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:57,490
<21-9,RYAN>我们还发现了这个
<21-9,RYAN>And we found this.

568
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,350
<21-10,CASTLE>科斯莫到过这里
<21-10,CASTLE>Cosmo was here.

569
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:02,850
<21-11,BECKETT>好吧  卡梅隆一定是在这里得到他的
<21-11,BECKETT>Okay, so this must be where Cameron got him from.

570
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:06,550
<21-11,BECKETT>一个婴儿怎么会在这里
<21-11,BECKETT>What was a baby doing here in the first place?

571
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:10,370
<21-11,BECKETT>让鉴证组仔细搜查这里
<21-11,BECKETT>Get C.S.U. Down here. Have them tear this place apart.

572
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,690
<21-11,BECKETT>指纹  痕量证据  任何能帮我们查明
<21-11,BECKETT>Prints, trace, anything that'll help us identify

573
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:15,080
<21-11,BECKETT>-其他涉案人员身份的东西  -好
<21-11,BECKETT>- whoever else was involved. - Right.

574
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:22,280
<22-1,BECKETT>你还好吗
<22-1,BECKETT>You okay?

575
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:25,640
<22-2,CASTLE>还好  我只是在想那个藏身所墙上的
<22-2,CASTLE>Yeah. I just keep wondering about whose blood that was

576
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,220
<22-2,CASTLE>血迹是谁的
<22-2,CASTLE>on the wall of the hideout.

577
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:30,490
<22-2,CASTLE>每次我想的时候  故事的结局都不好
<22-2,CASTLE>Every time I think about it, I don't like how the story ends.

578
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:32,140
<22-3,BECKETT>我已经联系了考弗斯大厦里的
<22-3,BECKETT>Well, I've contacted every business

579
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,710
<22-3,BECKETT>每一家商户
<22-3,BECKETT>in the Colfax Building.

580
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:35,910
<22-3,BECKETT>没有丢失物品也没有失踪的婴儿
<22-3,BECKETT>No thefts and no missing babies.

581
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:38,440
<22-4,ESPOSITO>我们又查了一下吉米·沃夫斯基
<22-4,ESPOSITO>Hey. We took another look at Jimmy Wolfinsky.

582
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,290
<22-4,ESPOSITO>就算他参与了  我们也找不到联系
<22-4,ESPOSITO>If he is involved, we can't find a connection.

583
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,560
<22-5,RYAN>我又跟卡梅隆的妻子谈了一次
<22-5,RYAN>I spoke to Cameron's wife again.

584
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,900
<22-5,RYAN>他生活中并没有出现什么新朋友
<22-5,RYAN>There's no indication of any new friends in his life.

585
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,170
<22-5,RYAN>但他们有财政问题
<22-5,RYAN>But they were having money issues.

586
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:47,390
<22-5,RYAN>他们就快要失去他们的房子了
<22-5,RYAN>They were on the verge of losing their house.

587
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:49,860
<22-5,RYAN>所以不管他做什么都是为了钱
<22-5,RYAN>So odds are, whatever he was doing was for the money.

588
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,550
<22-6,ESPOSITO>但他的通话记录没有什么异常
<22-6,ESPOSITO>But there was nothing unusual in his phone records,

589
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:52,990
<22-6,ESPOSITO>而且那晚没有通话记录
<22-6,ESPOSITO>and no activity that night.

590
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:54,380
<22-7,BECKETT>鉴证组刚刚开始工作
<22-7,BECKETT>Well, C.S.U. is just getting started,

591
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:56,240
<22-7,BECKETT>我们要明早才能得到进一步的消息
<22-7,BECKETT>and we're not gonna learn anything more until tomorrow,

592
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,280
<22-9,ESPOSITO>-所以...  -好吧
<22-9,ESPOSITO>- So... - All right.

593
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,710
<22-10,RYAN>-晚安  -晚安  伙计们
<22-10,RYAN>-Good night. - Good night, guys.

594
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:00,280
<22-11,BECKETT>我们也该走了
<22-11,BECKETT>We should probably get going, too.

595
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:04,300
<22-12,CASTLE>要知道  尽管卡梅隆中了枪
<22-12,CASTLE>You know, even though he had been shot,

596
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:07,050
<22-12,CASTLE>他还是尽可能地保护婴儿的安全
<22-12,CASTLE>Cameron did everything he could to keep that baby safe.

597
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:09,490
<22-12,CASTLE>那不像是一个坏人的行径
<22-12,CASTLE>That doesn't seem like the actions of a bad guy.

598
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:11,440
<22-13,BECKETT>对  他也许不是个坏人
<22-13,BECKETT>Yeah, well, he's probably not a bad guy.

599
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,430
<22-13,BECKETT>他只是做了个坏选择而且被它控制了
<22-13,BECKETT>He just made a bad choice and got in over his head.

600
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:16,690
<22-13,BECKETT>走吧  我们回家吧
<22-13,BECKETT>Now come on. Let's go home.

601
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:19,150
<23-1,SANDRA>嘘  没事的
<23-1,SANDRA>Shh, it's okay.

602
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:22,550
<23-1,SANDRA>没事的  嘘  嘘
<23-1,SANDRA>It's okay, shh. Hush, hush, hush.

603
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,710
<23-2,CASTLE>怎么了  科斯莫
<23-2,CASTLE>Oh, no. What's wrong, cosmo?

604
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:28,340
<23-3,BECKETT>-你还在这里  -对
<23-3,BECKETT>- You're still here? - Yeah.

605
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,450
<23-4,SANDRA>我一直在找一个寄养家庭
<23-4,SANDRA>I've been trying to locate a foster family.

606
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,120
<23-4,SANDRA>但因为这是感恩节周
<23-4,SANDRA>But because it's Thanksgiving week,

607
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,170
<23-4,SANDRA>没人能帮忙
<23-4,SANDRA>no one's available.

608
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:35,020
<23-4,SANDRA>我要把他送到郡危机中心去
<23-4,SANDRA>I'm gonna have to bring him to the county crisis center

609
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:37,200
<23-4,SANDRA>直到我找到能带他回家的人
<23-4,SANDRA>until I can find someone who can take him.

610
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,740
<23-5,CASTLE>你不是说那里没有床位了吗
<23-5,CASTLE>I thought you said there weren't any beds.

611
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,870
<23-6,SANDRA>人满为患时  就得让孩子同床
<23-6,SANDRA>When it's this crowded, they have to double up.

612
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,590
<23-7,CASTLE>没有别的选择了吗
<23-7,CASTLE>There's no other options?

613
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:44,580
<23-8,SANDRA>那是能收容婴儿的唯一地方
<23-8,SANDRA>That's the only place that can take an infant.

614
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,360
<23-9,CASTLE>如果我们带他回家呢
<23-9,CASTLE>Well, what if we take him?

615
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:47,500
<23-10,BECKETT>等等
<23-10,BECKETT>Wait...

616
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:48,940
<23-10,BECKETT>什么
<23-10,BECKETT>What?

617
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:50,910
<23-11,CASTLE>我们已经很熟悉了  我什么都有
<23-11,CASTLE>Well, we've already bonded. I-I got all the stuff.

618
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:52,820
<23-12,BECKETT>不  卡塞尔  我跟你说过了
<23-12,BECKETT>No, no. Castle, I told you.

619
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:55,840
<23-13,CASTLE>我知道  你还不习惯身边有孩子
<23-13,CASTLE>I know, I know. You haven't been around babies that much.

620
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,890
<23-13,CASTLE>没什么大不了的
<23-13,CASTLE>Not a big deal.

621
00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:59,440
<23-13,CASTLE>我搞得定  我是婴语者
<23-13,CASTLE>I got this. I'm the baby whisperer.

622
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:02,080
<23-14,BECKETT>她不会就这么给你个小宝宝
<23-14,BECKETT>Look, she's not gonna just give you a baby.

623
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,490
<23-14,BECKETT>我肯定会有背景调查
<23-14,BECKETT>I'm sure that there are background checks

624
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:06,230
<23-14,BECKETT>和填一堆的表  对吧
<23-14,BECKETT>and forms that we have to fill out, right?

625
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:09,150
<23-15,SANDRA>如果纽约警察官方监管
<23-15,SANDRA>Not... if the baby officially remains

626
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:11,580
<23-15,SANDRA>就不需要了
<23-15,SANDRA>in the custody of the N.Y.P.D.

627
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,550
<23-15,SANDRA>你俩目前为止
<23-15,SANDRA>And you guys have done...

628
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:15,540
<23-15,SANDRA>都表现不错哟
<23-15,SANDRA>an amazing job so far.

629
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:18,370
<23-16,CASTLE>你觉得怎么样  贝克特
<23-16,CASTLE>What do you say, Beckett?

630
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:20,690
<23-16,CASTLE>想要个宝宝吗
<23-16,CASTLE>Wanna have a baby?

631
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,200
<23-17,CASTLE>来嘛  肯定很有趣
<23-17,CASTLE>Come on! It'll be fun.

632
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,590
<23-17,CASTLE>抱歉
<23-17,CASTLE>Sorry.

633
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,200
<24-1,CASTLE>太没有趣了
<24-1,CASTLE>This is so not fun.

634
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,390
<24-2,BECKETT>卡塞尔  如果你想用这种方式
<24-2,BECKETT>Castle, if this is a part of your plan

635
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:41,800
<24-2,BECKETT>把我变成爱孩子的人
<24-2,BECKETT>to turn me into a baby person,

636
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,000
<24-2,BECKETT>可一点都没作用哦
<24-2,BECKETT>it's not working.

637
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:43,970
<24-2,BECKETT>我没有
<24-2,BECKETT>It isn't.

638
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:45,930
<24-3,CASTLE>一开始是这么想的  但是
<24-3,CASTLE>Well, it was, at first. But...

639
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:48,060
<24-3,CASTLE>他在局里的时候多乖啊
<24-3,CASTLE>he was so good at the precinct.

640
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,280
<24-4,BECKETT>我还以为你是"婴语者"呢
<24-4,BECKETT>I thought you were the "Baby whisperer."

641
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,500
<24-5,CASTLE>我就是
<24-5,CASTLE>I am.

642
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:52,390
<24-5,CASTLE>是宝宝出了问题
<24-5,CASTLE>There's something wrong with this baby.

643
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:54,430
<24-6,BECKETT>好吧  这里说
<24-6,BECKETT>Ooh, okay! So, it says here that,

644
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:57,810
<24-6,BECKETT>"轻轻地摇宝宝  可以让他安静下来"
<24-6,BECKETT>"Gently bouncing your baby should calm him or her down."

645
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,670
<24-7,CASTLE>好了  好了
<24-7,CASTLE>Okay, okay, okay, okay.

646
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:01,890
<24-8,BECKETT>有主意了
<24-8,BECKETT>I got an idea.

647
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,600
<24-9,CASTLE>嘘  嘘  好了
<24-9,CASTLE>Shh, shh, okay.

648
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:06,230
<24-9,CASTLE>你让我很难堪啊  宝宝
<24-9,CASTLE>You're making me look bad, kid.

649
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:08,060
<24-9,CASTLE>你想要啥都行  小家伙
<24-9,CASTLE>Anything you want, okay, buddy?

650
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:11,070
<24-9,CASTLE>告诉我  我就给你
<24-9,CASTLE>You just tell me what it is, I will give it to you.

651
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,900
<24-9,CASTLE>好了  嘘
<24-9,CASTLE>Okay, shh.

00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:15,810
<24-10,BECKETT>坐  摇吧
<24-10,BECKETT>Here, sit. Bounce.

653
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:23,450
<24-12,BECKETT>还真有用
<24-12,BECKETT>Ooh, it's working.

654
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:26,290
<24-13,CASTLE>你真是天才
<24-13,CASTLE>Yeah. You're a genius.

655
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:34,560
<24-14,CASTLE>别笑
<24-14,CASTLE>Do not laugh.

656
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,570
<24-15,BECKETT>我没笑
<24-15,BECKETT>I'm not laughing.

657
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:37,830
<24-16,CASTLE>不许笑  给我纸巾
<24-16,CASTLE>You do not laugh. Get me the towel.

<24-17,BECKETT>Okay, here.

<24-22,CASTLE>谢了  给你
<24-22,CASTLE>Come on. Thank you. Here we go. There we go.

<24-26,CASTLE>Not on that chair.

665
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,980
<24-28,CASTLE>把他放毯子上  我讨厌那条毯子
<24-28,CASTLE>Put him on the blanket. I hate that blanket.

666
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,760
<24-29,BECKETT>我们到讨厌的毯子上
<24-29,BECKETT>We're going on the nasty blanket.

667
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,190
<24-29,BECKETT>很好

<24-30,CASTLE>- Hold him, or he'll roll off. - Yes.

669
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:05,690
<24-31,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我觉得他需要换身衣服
<24-31,BECKETT>Castle, I think he needs a change of clothes.

670
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:08,030
<24-32,CASTLE>帮他脱掉衣服  我去拿套新的
<24-32,CASTLE>Uh, get him undressed. I'll get a onesie.

00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:11,160
<24-32,CASTLE>换衣服  换衣服
<24-32,CASTLE>Changin', changin'...

679
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:36,870
<24-39,CASTLE>接着
<24-39,CASTLE>And...

680
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,570
<24-40,CASTLE>就是胜利
<24-40,CASTLE>victory.

681
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,350
<24-40,CASTLE>我们成功了
<24-40,CASTLE>We've done it.

682
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,310
<24-40,CASTLE>好了
<24-40,CASTLE>All right.

683
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,580
<24-41,CASTLE>-抱着他  -好的
<24-41,CASTLE>- You hold him. - Okay, all right.

<24-43,CASTLE>给你  我来处理这个
<24-43,CASTLE>There we go. I'll take care of... this.

00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,440
<24-44,BECKETT>里克叔叔很逗吧
<24-44,BECKETT>Uncle Rick's pretty funny, huh?

686
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:57,640
<24-44,BECKETT>我觉得你也好逗
<24-44,BECKETT>I think you're pretty funny, too.

687
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,290
<24-45,CASTLE>怎么了

689
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,330
<24-46,BECKETT>好吧
<24-46,BECKETT>All right.

690
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:12,090
<24-47,CASTLE>现在我们要做的就是把他哄睡
<24-47,CASTLE>Now all we have to do is get him to sleep.

691
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:17,290
<25-1,MARTHA RODGERS>你是个饿饿的小男孩
<25-1,MARTHA RODGERS>Well, you are a hungry boy.

<25-1,MARTHA RODGERS>你真幸运
<25-1,MARTHA RODGERS>Good for you.

694
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,290
<25-2,MARTHA>看啊  谁醒了
<25-2,MARTHA>Oh, well, look who's up.

695
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:33,200
<25-3,ALEXIS>我是多久没回家了
<25-3,ALEXIS>How long have I been gone?

696
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:39,490
<26-1,BECKETT>连咖啡都没用
<26-1,BECKETT>Coffee's not even helping.

697
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,110
<26-2,CASTLE>忘记这码事儿了
<26-2,CASTLE>I'd forgotten about this part.

698
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:47,560
<26-3,RYAN>你们两个好像被送奶车撞了一样
<26-3,RYAN>You two look like you got hit by the milk truck.

699
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,580
<26-4,CASTLE>看到这张脸没有
<26-4,CASTLE>You see this face?

700
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,440
<26-4,CASTLE>这就是你以后的脸
<26-4,CASTLE>This is the face of your future.

701
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,680
<26-5,ESPOSITO>这么糟啊
<26-5,ESPOSITO>That bad, huh?

702
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,190
<26-6,CASTLE>不  不  不  我们睡得像婴儿一样
<26-6,CASTLE>No, no, no, we slept like babies.

703
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:58,770
<26-7,BECKETT>是啊  一个小时醒一次
<26-7,BECKETT>Yeah, up every hour.

704
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:00,420
<26-8,RYAN>小家伙在哪儿呢
<26-8,RYAN>Where is the little guy?

705
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:03,640
<26-9,BECKETT>玛莎和阿丽克西斯主动提出要照料他
<26-9,BECKETT>Martha and Alexis offered to babysit him.

706
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:05,660
<26-9,BECKETT>她们说要搞个照看宝宝日
<26-9,BECKETT>They said they're gonna make a day out of it.

707
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:08,290
<26-9,BECKETT>我们那个什么查得怎么样了
<26-9,BECKETT>So, where are we on, um...

708
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:10,100
<26-10,ESPOSITO>-儿童服务机构  -对  儿童服务机构
<26-10,ESPOSITO>- Child services? - Child services.

709
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:11,500
<26-11,BECKETT>还是没人上报失踪婴儿
<26-11,BECKETT>Still no reports of a missing baby.

710
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,650
<26-12,ESPOSITO>不过在你们哄宝宝的时候
<26-12,ESPOSITO>But while you two were bouncing junior on your knee,

711
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:14,880
<26-12,ESPOSITO>鉴证组的报告出来了
<26-12,ESPOSITO>C.S.U. reports came in.

712
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,880
<26-13,RYAN>不管凶手是谁  清理了现场
<26-13,RYAN>Whoever was there cleaned up after themselves.

713
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,540
<26-13,RYAN>现场没有指纹
<26-13,RYAN>The place was wiped down for prints.

714
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:19,910
<26-14,BECKETT>枪击呢
<26-14,BECKETT>What about that fire?

715
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:22,380
<26-15,RYAN>分析报告显示烧伤处有高浓度的
<26-15,RYAN>Analysis of the burn showed high concentration

716
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:24,720
<26-15,RYAN>硝化纤维和樟脑
<26-15,RYAN>nitrocellulose and camphor.

717
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,240
<26-16,CASTLE>烧焦的赛璐璐
<26-16,CASTLE>Charred celluloid.

718
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,160
<26-17,BECKETT>-和卡梅隆身上的一样  -我们发现的血迹
<26-17,BECKETT>- Just like on Cameron. - That blood we found--

719
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,800
<26-18,ESPOSITO>根据基因标记
<26-18,ESPOSITO>According to genetic markers,

720
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,670
<26-18,ESPOSITO>和这个宝宝有血缘关系
<26-18,ESPOSITO>came from someone related to that baby.

721
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:34,990
<26-19,RYAN>但是没有其他的信息
<26-19,RYAN>But without anything else to go on,

722
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:36,540
<26-19,RYAN>我们只知道他们有血缘关系
<26-19,RYAN>all we know is that they are related.

723
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,050
<26-19,RYAN>还是不知道他们是谁
<26-19,RYAN>We still don't know who either of them are.

724
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,610
<26-20,CASTLE>卡梅隆呢  他肯定知道
<26-20,CASTLE>What about Cameron? He must've known.

725
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:41,220
<26-21,RYAN>我们又查了一遍他的手机  朋友
<26-21,RYAN>We rechecked his phones, friends,

726
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:41,980
<26-21,RYAN>和财务情况
<26-21,RYAN>and financials.

727
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:43,830
<26-21,RYAN>不管发生过什么  他隐藏的很好
<26-21,RYAN>Whatever was going on, he hid it well.

728
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:45,250
<26-22,ESPOSITO>由于办公楼里没人知道
<26-22,ESPOSITO>And since no one in that office building

729
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:46,420
<26-22,ESPOSITO>这帮劫匪的目的是什么
<26-22,ESPOSITO>knows what our thieves were after,

730
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:47,710
<26-22,ESPOSITO>我们又回到原点了
<26-22,ESPOSITO>we're back at square one.

731
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:49,090
<26-23,BECKETT>也许不是
<26-23,BECKETT>Maybe not.

732
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:50,680
<26-24,ESPOSITO>为啥  你想到了什么
<26-24,ESPOSITO>Why? What are you thinking?

733
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,590
<26-25,BECKETT>考虑到我们昨晚
<26-25,BECKETT>I--given how much baby garbage

734
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:54,600
<26-25,BECKETT>搞出的那些婴儿垃圾
<26-25,BECKETT>we generated in just one night,

735
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,120
<26-25,BECKETT>和他们在枪击之后的清理
<26-25,BECKETT>and how quickly they cleaned and vacated that apartment

736
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,430
<26-25,BECKETT>和撤退速度
<26-25,BECKETT>after the shooting,

737
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:00,890
<26-25,BECKETT>我在想他们把垃圾扔哪儿了
<26-25,BECKETT>I'm wondering where all their garbage went.

738
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:06,000
<27-1,CASTLE>你把我带到了最有风情的地方
<27-1,CASTLE>You take me to the most exotic places.

739
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:08,080
<27-2,BECKETT>如果你不想进来
<27-2,BECKETT>Look, if you didn't wanna jump in,

740
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,450
<27-2,BECKETT>可以在旁边等啊
<27-2,BECKETT>you could've just waited on the side

741
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:10,940
<27-2,BECKETT>像以前一样
<27-2,BECKETT>like you usually do.

742
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:13,040
<27-3,CASTLE>啥  你在开玩笑吗  经历了昨晚
<27-3,CASTLE>What? Are you kidding? After the puke storm

743
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,570
<27-3,CASTLE>让你深陷其中的呕吐风波
<27-3,CASTLE>I put you through last night,

744
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:16,360
<27-3,CASTLE>不参与进来感觉很不对啊
<27-3,CASTLE>it felt wrong not to participate.

745
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,320
<27-4,BECKETT>是哦
<27-4,BECKETT>Yeah.

746
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:19,900
<27-5,CASTLE>顺便说一下  你昨晚很棒
<27-5,CASTLE>Which, by the way, you were great last night.

747
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:22,130
<27-6,BECKETT>谢谢  你也不赖啊
<27-6,BECKETT>Thank you. You weren't so bad yourself.

748
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:24,630
<27-7,CASTLE>我不是什么婴语者
<27-7,CASTLE>Well, I was no baby whisperer.

749
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,990
<27-7,CASTLE>我得说  当我主动要求
<27-7,CASTLE>You know, I-I gotta say, when I--when I volunteered

750
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:30,330
<27-7,CASTLE>收养科斯莫的时候  我以为是为他好
<27-7,CASTLE>to take Cosmo, I-I thought I was doing it for his benefit.

751
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:34,840
<27-7,CASTLE>但是我发现  我更是为了自己
<27-7,CASTLE>But... I realized I was doing it more for mine.

752
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:37,930
<27-7,CASTLE>阿丽克西斯还小的时候
<27-7,CASTLE>I... when Alexis was little,

753
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:39,440
<27-7,CASTLE>梅瑞狄斯经常不在家
<27-7,CASTLE>Meredith really wasn't around.

754
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:41,120
<27-8,BECKETT>都是我自己照顾她
<27-8,BECKETT>So I-I did it all on my own.

755
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,380
<27-8,BECKETT>当你说你不喜欢小孩子的时候
<27-8,BECKETT>And when you said you weren't a baby person--

756
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,960
<27-8,BECKETT>好的  好的  我明白了
<27-8,BECKETT>Oh, okay, okay. I get it.

757
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,210
<27-8,BECKETT>-你在想  -是的
<27-8,BECKETT>- You were thinking that... - Yeah.

758
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:49,940
<27-10,BECKETT>告诉你吧
<27-10,BECKETT>Okay, well, I'll tell you what.

759
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:51,280
<27-10,BECKETT>等到那一天
<27-10,BECKETT>When the time comes...

760
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,230
<27-10,BECKETT>我绝不可能让你
<27-10,BECKETT>There's no way I'm gonna let you

761
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:56,180
<27-10,BECKETT>一个人照顾我们的孩子
<27-10,BECKETT>take care of our baby on your own.

762
00:29:58,450 --> 00:29:59,710
<27-11,RYAN>伙计们
<27-11,RYAN>Hey, guys!

765
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:09,850
<27-13,RYAN>和科斯莫被我们发现时穿得一样
<27-13,RYAN>Same kind that Cosmo was wearing when we found him.

766
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:11,640
<27-14,CASTLE>便宜不可降解型的
<27-14,CASTLE>Cheap, non-biodegradable kind?

767
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,830
<27-14,CASTLE>简直是犯罪
<27-14,CASTLE>Well, that's just criminal.

768
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:14,030
<27-15,BECKETT>袋子里还有什么
<27-15,BECKETT>What else is in the bag?

00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:22,580

771
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:24,410
<27-16,RYAN>真的吗  可真奇怪
<27-16,RYAN>Really? That's weird.

<27-17,ESPOSITO>乒乓球  球拍和桌网
<27-17,ESPOSITO>Ping pong balls, paddles, and a net.

<27-18,CASTLE>那就是用赛璐珞做的  十分易燃
<27-18,CASTLE>Those are made of celluloid, highly flammable.

775
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:30,850
<27-18,CASTLE>所以才会有那些烧痕
<27-18,CASTLE>That's what caused the burn.

776
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:33,310
<27-19,ESPOSITO>说真的  他们烧乒乓球做什么
<27-19,ESPOSITO>Really? They were lighting ping pong balls on fire?

777
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,740
<27-20,BECKETT>把这些交给鉴证组  看能否提取出指纹来
<27-20,BECKETT>Okay, get the bags to C.S.U. see if they can pull prints.

778
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:39,680
<27-21,RYAN>这有一张三天前的收据

<27-21,RYAN>for the diapers from a quick mart.

00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:42,770
<27-21,RYAN>现金支付

<28-4,BECKETT>身世不明的婴儿  外加无人遭窃的盗窃案
<28-4,BECKETT>a missing baby, and a heist where nothing was taken.

789
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:10,680
<28-4,BECKETT>好像我们每取得一点进展
<28-4,BECKETT>I mean, each time we find a piece of this puzzle,

790
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,250
<28-4,BECKETT>整个案件似乎就更加无解
<28-4,BECKETT>it makes less and less sense.

791
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:13,880
<28-5,CASTLE>我们肯定漏下了什么
<28-5,CASTLE>There's something we're missing.

<28-5,CASTLE>-肯定有什么  -快看快看

<28-7,CASTLE>都安静  大伙儿
<28-7,CASTLE>Shh, shh, shh, quiet, everybody!

804

<29-5,CASTLE>我们遗漏的线索  我知道是什么了
<29-5,CASTLE>That something we're missing? I think we just found it.

<29-6,MIRANDA>You could be next.

808

<29-6,MIRANDA>你准备好梦想成真了吗
<29-6,MIRANDA>Are you ready for your dreams to come true?

809
00:31:57,970 --> 00:31:58,880
<29-7,RYAN>准备好啦
<29-7,RYAN>Yes.

<29-7,RYAN>Here we go...

<29-9,OFFICER HARRISON>I've got that.

813
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:09,540

815
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:12,690
<29-12,CASTLE>22
<29-12,CASTLE>22...

816
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:15,040
<29-12,CASTLE>22
<29-12,CASTLE>22...

817
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,430
<29-14,CASTLE>17
<29-14,CASTLE>17...

818
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:18,000
<29-14,CASTLE>17
<29-14,CASTLE>17...

819
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,840
<29-16,CASTLE>37
<29-16,CASTLE>37...

820
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:23,800
<29-16,CASTLE>37
<29-16,CASTLE>37...

821
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:26,360
<29-17,MIRANDA>魔法球号码是
<29-17,MIRANDA>And the magicball number is...

822
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,830
<29-18,CASTLE>28
<29-18,CASTLE>28.

823
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:28,750
<29-19,ESPOSITO>不可能
<29-19,ESPOSITO>No way.

824
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:30,020
<29-18,CASTLE>28
<29-18,CASTLE>28.

825
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,270
<29-20,MIRANDA>-怎么可能  -我是米兰达·瓦尔
<29-20,MIRANDA>- What the-- - I'm Miranda Vail...

826
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:33,790
<29-21,ESPOSITO>你怎么知道的  卡塞尔
<29-21,ESPOSITO>How'd you know that, Castle?

827
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,350
<29-23,BECKETT>-卡梅隆手上的彩票  -这就是动机
<29-23,BECKETT>- It's Cameron's lottery ticket - And it's motive.

828
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:39,600
<29-24,CASTLE>埃斯波西托  你说过考弗斯大厦里
<29-24,CASTLE>Esposito, you said that there was a TV station

829
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,960
<29-24,CASTLE>有一家电视台
<29-24,CASTLE>in the Colfax building?

830
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,370
<29-25,ESPOSITO>没错  WQTI台
<29-25,ESPOSITO>Yeah, WQTI.

831
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:44,550
<29-26,CASTLE>这就对了  那起没丢东西的失窃案
<29-26,CASTLE>Right, the break-in where nothing was stolen?

832
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,300
<29-26,CASTLE>乒乓球  蜡和氩气
<29-26,CASTLE>Ping pong balls, wax, gas.

833
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,080
<29-26,CASTLE>各位  全都能说通了
<29-26,CASTLE>You guys, it makes perfect sense.

834
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,090
<29-26,CASTLE>这是一起彩票作弊案
<29-26,CASTLE>He fixed the lottery.

835
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,990
<30-1,CASTLE>他们不是去偷东西  是偷天换日
<30-1,CASTLE>It wasn't a heist. It was an exchange.

836
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,800
<30-2,BECKETT>他们把官方的奖球换成了
<30-2,BECKETT>They replaced the official lotto balls

837
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:01,670
<30-2,BECKETT>被他们动过手脚的
<30-2,BECKETT>with the doctored ones,

838
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:03,940
<30-2,BECKETT>所以没人发觉有任何东西失窃了
<30-2,BECKETT>which is why no one knew anything was missing.

839
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,060
<30-3,CASTLE>他们肯定用氩气注满奖球
<30-3,CASTLE>They must've filled their lottery balls

840
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:08,740
<30-3,CASTLE>然后用蜡封住注射口
<30-3,CASTLE>with argon gas, sealing the hole with wax.

841
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:11,160
<30-3,CASTLE>摄影棚的灯光一照射  温度升高
<30-3,CASTLE>Under the hot lights of the tv studio,

842
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:13,140
<30-3,CASTLE>氩气使假球膨胀
<30-3,CASTLE>the argon would make the balls expand enough,

843
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:14,170
<30-3,CASTLE>无法进入滑道
<30-3,CASTLE>they wouldn't go in the chute.

844
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:15,130
<30-3,CASTLE>只能弹到一边
<30-3,CASTLE>They would just bounce off.

845
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:17,650
<30-4,RYAN>这样只有没注过氩气的假球才能进入滑道
<30-4,RYAN>So only the balls without gas can fit through 'em.

846
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:18,910
<30-5,CASTLE>他们肯定做过测试
<30-5,CASTLE>Yeah, they must've been doing tests,

847
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:20,830
<30-5,CASTLE>对注有氩气的假球进行加热
<30-5,CASTLE>exposing the gas-filled balls to heat sources,

848
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:23,460
<30-5,CASTLE>结果离热源太近  乒乓球又十分易燃
<30-5,CASTLE>and gotten them too close, and celluloid is flammable...

849
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,920
<30-6,RYAN>-所以失火了  -全说通了
<30-6,RYAN>- That's how the fire started. - It all fits.

850
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,900
<30-6,RYAN>只有一种办法能证明
<30-6,RYAN>And there's one sure way to prove it.

851
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:30,320
<31-1,CASTLE>-17  -不可能
<31-1,CASTLE>- 17... - No.

852
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,340
<31-2,DEAN SEAHORN>-37  -这不可能
<31-2,DEAN SEAHORN>-37... - No, no.

853
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:35,570
<31-2,DEAN SEAHORN>-不  这不可能  -结果就摆在那里
<31-2,DEAN SEAHORN>- No, this is impossible. - And yet...

854
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,860
<31-4,DEAN>你不明白  这根本不应该发生
<31-4,DEAN>You don't understand. This can't happen.

855
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:41,110
<31-4,DEAN>奖球都是彩票委员会派人亲手用
<31-4,DEAN>The balls are hand-delivered and locked in sealed briefcases

856
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,510
<31-4,DEAN>密封上锁的手提箱送到这里
<31-4,DEAN>by the lottery commission.

857
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:45,020
<31-4,DEAN>手提箱会放在保险柜里  只有两个人能打开
<31-4,DEAN>They're placed in a safe that only two people have access to.

858
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:46,200
<31-5,CASTLE>那从保险柜取出手提箱之后
<31-5,CASTLE>And what happens to the case

859
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:48,170
<31-5,CASTLE>进摄影棚之前是怎么处理的
<31-5,CASTLE>between the safe and the studio?

860
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:50,840
<31-6,DEAN>我们在开奖直播之前
<31-6,DEAN>One briefcase is chosen at random,

861
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:54,310
<31-6,DEAN>从九个完全一样的手提箱中随机挑选一个
<31-6,DEAN>between nine identical cases just before the drawing.

862
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:56,400
<31-6,DEAN>之后我们从箱中取出奖球
<31-6,DEAN>The balls are then removed from the case,

863
00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:57,900
<31-6,DEAN>逐个称重测量  然后由专人
<31-6,DEAN>weighed, measured, and then placed

864
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,750
<31-6,DEAN>带着橡胶手套将其放入开奖机
<31-6,DEAN>inside the machine by people wearing rubber gloves.

865
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:03,080
<31-6,DEAN>因此这种情况  根本没有出现的可能
<31-6,DEAN>Making this... A statistical impossibility.

866
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,940
<31-6,DEAN>这种情况出现的概率就跟...
<31-6,DEAN>The odds against this happening are like...

867
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,640
<31-7,CASTLE>中头奖一样低
<31-7,CASTLE>Winning the lottery?

868
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,460
<31-8,BECKETT>录像里他们拿的手提箱
<31-8,BECKETT>The case that they had with them at the time

869
00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:12,050
<31-8,BECKETT>只能装下一套奖球
<31-8,BECKETT>was only large enough to fit one set of balls.

870
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,810
<31-8,BECKETT>你说过开奖的这套奖球
<31-8,BECKETT>You said that they set that you used

871
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:16,410
<31-8,BECKETT>是随机挑选的  谁负责挑选
<31-8,BECKETT>was chosen at random. Who makes that choice?

872
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,780
<31-9,DEAN>就是开奖主持人  米兰达·瓦尔
<31-9,DEAN>Our lottery announcer, Miranda Vail.

873
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:21,350
<31-9,DEAN>但她已经干这行十年了
<31-9,DEAN>But she's been with us for ten years.

874
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:22,940
<31-9,DEAN>绝对做不出这样的事
<31-9,DEAN>She would never do something like that.

875
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,730
<31-10,BECKETT>她有孩子吗
<31-10,BECKETT>Does she have any children?

876
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:26,320
<31-11,DEAN>有  一个男婴
<31-11,DEAN>Yeah, a baby boy.

877
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:28,180
<31-12,CASTLE>多大了
<31-12,CASTLE>How old?

878
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:29,730
<31-13,DEAN>大概三个月吧
<31-13,DEAN>Maybe 3 months.

879
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:31,640
<31-14,BECKETT>她现在在哪
<31-14,BECKETT>Where is she right now?

880
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,350
<31-15,DEAN>她说她不太舒服  刚刚走了
<31-15,DEAN>She said she wasn't feeling well. She just left.

881
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:35,240
<31-16,BECKETT>好  你待在这  那些奖球是证据
<31-16,BECKETT>Okay, you stay here. That's evidence.

882
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,540
<31-16,BECKETT>给我看好那些球
<31-16,BECKETT>Watch those balls.

883
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:40,260
<31-17,CASTLE>太黄了  我还是别开玩笑了
<31-17,CASTLE>No. Not touching it.

884
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,550
<32-1,BECKETT>米兰达
<32-1,BECKETT>Miranda!

885

<32-3,BECKETT>请等一下  我们得谈谈
<32-3,BECKETT>Please, just wait. We need to talk.

<32-11,BECKETT>- He's safe. He's-- - What about my husband?

894

<32-12,MIRANDA>保罗  他们把他也劫走了
<32-12,MIRANDA>Paul, they have him, too.

895
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:11,080
<33-1,MIRANDA>他们三天前打电话给我
<33-1,MIRANDA>They called me three days ago.

896
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:12,830
<33-2,BECKETT>谁
<33-2,BECKETT>Who?

897
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,250
<33-2,BECKETT>一个男的
<33-2,BECKETT>A man.

898
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:18,590
<33-3,MIRANDA>他说我丈夫保罗还有本尼在他们手上
<33-3,MIRANDA>He said they were holding Paul, my husband, and Benny,

899
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,130
<33-3,MIRANDA>如果我报警
<33-3,MIRANDA>And that if I went to the police

900
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:22,670
<33-3,MIRANDA>或者向任何人求助  他俩全都活不成
<33-3,MIRANDA>or said anything to anyone, he would kill them both.

901
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:24,340
<33-4,BECKETT>他的声音你能认出来吗
<33-4,BECKETT>And did you recognize his voice?

902
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,620
<33-5,MIRANDA>他用了变声器
<33-5,MIRANDA>It was disguised.

903
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:28,280
<33-5,MIRANDA>他说如果我还想全家团圆
<33-5,MIRANDA>He told me that if I wanted to see my family again,

904
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,440
<33-5,MIRANDA>我就必须按照他说的去做
<33-5,MIRANDA>I had to do exactly as he said.

905
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,990
<33-6,CASTLE>他让你做什么
<33-6,CASTLE>And what did he tell you to do?

906
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,650
<33-7,MIRANDA>他说这很容易
<33-7,MIRANDA>He said it was easy.

907
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:36,000
<33-7,MIRANDA>我只需要按他要求挑选一箱奖球
<33-7,MIRANDA>All I had to do was pick the right set of balls.

908
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,680
<33-7,MIRANDA>他会在开奖当天早上打电话
<33-7,MIRANDA>He would call me the morning of the lottery

909
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,910
<33-7,MIRANDA>告诉我应该挑哪一箱
<33-7,MIRANDA>and tell me which one.

910
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:39,800

<33-9,MIRANDA>Yesterday, at 5:00 a.m., he told me to pick

912
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,490
<33-9,MIRANDA>挑左数第三个手提箱
<33-9,MIRANDA>the third briefcase from the left,

913
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:45,220
<33-9,MIRANDA>如果最后的中奖码和他希望的不一样
<33-9,MIRANDA>and that if his numbers didn't come up,

914
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:46,560
<33-9,MIRANDA>我就会失去丈夫和儿子
<33-9,MIRANDA>that I would be sorry.

915
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,520
<33-10,BECKETT>你在电话里听到别的声音了吗
<33-10,BECKETT>Did you hear anything else?

916
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,630
<33-10,BECKETT>从背景声里听出什么了吗
<33-10,BECKETT>Anything in the background?

917
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:53,080
<33-11,MIRANDA>没有  我只能听出本尼在哭
<33-11,MIRANDA>No. All I heard was Benny crying.

918
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,650
<33-11,MIRANDA>我什么时候能见到孩子  他在这吗
<33-11,MIRANDA>When do I get to see him? Is he here?

919
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:58,280
<33-12,BECKETT>有人正带他过来呢
<33-12,BECKETT>He's on his way in right now.

920
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:00,170
<33-13,CASTLE>有件事我还是不太明白
<33-13,CASTLE>One thing I-I still don't get.

921
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:02,730
<33-13,CASTLE>等他们来领奖的时候
<33-13,CASTLE>When they came forward to collect their winnings,

922
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:03,790
<33-13,CASTLE>你就能知道他们是谁了
<33-13,CASTLE>you would know who they were.

923
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:05,300
<33-13,CASTLE>他们又打算怎么逃跑呢
<33-13,CASTLE>How did they plan on getting away with it?

924
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,610
<33-14,MIRANDA>他们会把保罗和本尼
<33-14,MIRANDA>They were going to hold Paul and Benny

925
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,890
<33-14,MIRANDA>多关几天  直到他们能去取钱
<33-14,MIRANDA>another couple of days, until they could collect their winnings.

926
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,050
<33-14,MIRANDA>他们一旦把奖金转移出国
<33-14,MIRANDA>Once they moved the money out of the country,

927
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:13,480
<33-14,MIRANDA>就会放了我的家人
<33-14,MIRANDA>they were going to release them.

928
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:14,510
<33-14,MIRANDA>但是现在
<33-14,MIRANDA>But now...

929
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:17,550
<33-14,MIRANDA>你能找到他吗
<33-14,MIRANDA>Do you think you can find him?

930
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:22,710
<34-1,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>如果保罗仍是人质  他活不长了
<34-1,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>If Paul's still a hostage, he won't be for long.

931
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:24,660
<34-1,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>不管那天晚上绑架他的人之间发生了什么
<34-1,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>Whatever happened that night with his captors,

932
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,170
<34-1,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>他们的计划都砸了
<34-1,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>their plan is blown.

933
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:27,590
<34-2,BECKETT>不一定
<34-2,BECKETT>Not necessarily.

934
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:29,110
<34-2,BECKETT>我们刚刚跟彩票局的官员联系过
<34-2,BECKETT>We checked with lottery officials.

935
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:31,290
<34-2,BECKETT>在卡梅隆的尸体被发现了几个小时后
<34-2,BECKETT>A second ticket with the exact same numbers

936
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:32,260
<34-2,BECKETT>纽约市里卖出了第二张
<34-2,BECKETT>was sold in the city

937
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:34,710
<34-2,BECKETT>有着同样号码的彩票
<34-2,BECKETT>just hours after Cameron's body was found.

938
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:36,160
<34-3,GATES>代替我们找到的这一张
<34-3,GATES>A replacement ticket.

939
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,760
<34-4,CASTLE>他们可能还不知道我们已经发现了这一切
<34-4,CASTLE>They might not know we made the connection

940
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,680
<34-4,CASTLE>和彩票之间的联系
<34-4,CASTLE>to the lottery.

941
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,180
<34-4,CASTLE>毕竟米兰达执行了他们的指令
<34-4,CASTLE>After all, Miranda did as she was asked.

942
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:42,550
<34-4,CASTLE>所以他们也许还会来领奖金
<34-4,CASTLE>So they may still come forward.

943
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:44,720
<34-5,GATES>万一他们觉得这样太冒险了呢
<34-5,GATES>What if they decide that it's too risky?

944
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,740
<34-5,GATES>万一他们发现我们知道了呢
<34-5,GATES>What if they discover that we know?

945
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,950
<34-6,BECKETT>那保罗·瓦尔对于他们来说就只是个负担了
<34-6,BECKETT>Then Paul Vail will be nothing but a liability,

946
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:52,580
<34-6,BECKETT>他们一定会杀了他的
<34-6,BECKETT>and they will kill him.

947
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,410
<34-7,GATES>那么我们就要在那之前找到他
<34-7,GATES>Then we need to find him before that happens.

948
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,520
<35-1,RYAN>鉴证组的人正在重新检查卡梅的车
<35-1,RYAN>C.S.U.'s going over Cam's car again.

949
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,750
<35-1,RYAN>看能不能找到他的搭档留下的任何证据
<35-1,RYAN>See if his partners left any trace evidence.

950
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:07,300
<35-1,RYAN>但是需要时间
<35-1,RYAN>But it's gonna take time.

951
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:08,800
<35-2,GATES>我们现在最缺的就是时间
<35-2,GATES>Time is one thing we don't have.

952
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:10,470
<35-3,BECKETT>而且我们面临的挑战很艰巨
<35-3,BECKETT>And we're facing an uphill battle.

953
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:12,290
<35-3,BECKETT>不管这伙是什么人  他们肯定有手艺
<35-3,BECKETT>Whoever these guys are, they must've been damn good

954
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,830
<35-3,BECKETT>才能突破那栋大楼的保安系统而且不被发现
<35-3,BECKETT>to get past that building's security undetected.

955
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:17,270
<35-4,CASTLE>等一下  要是他们没那么做呢
<35-4,CASTLE>Wait. What if they didn't?

956
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,230
<35-5,ESPOSITO>你什么意思
<35-5,ESPOSITO>What do you mean?

957
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:20,030
<35-6,CASTLE>我们已经查到他们在考弗斯大楼
<35-6,CASTLE>We already know they have one person

958
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:22,040
<35-6,CASTLE>有一个内应  也就是米兰达
<35-6,CASTLE>working on the inside of the Colfax building --

959
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,490
<35-6,CASTLE>但万一他们在那里有俩人呢
<35-6,CASTLE>Miranda, but what if they have two?

960
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:26,420
<35-7,BECKETT>他们需要有个人帮他们绕过大楼的安保系统
<35-7,BECKETT>They would've needed someone to help them circumvent

961
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:28,780
<35-7,BECKETT>躲避摄像头
<35-7,BECKETT>the building's security system, avoid the camera,

962
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:29,930
<35-7,BECKETT>并且改写进门记录
<35-7,BECKETT>and rewrite all the logs.

963
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:32,340
<35-8,CASTLE>唯一能在不被人察觉的情况下做到这些的人
<35-8,CASTLE>The only person capable of doing that undetected...

964
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,970
<35-9,BECKETT>就是安保总管
<35-9,BECKETT>Is the head of security.

965
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:36,100
<35-10,CASTLE>他在那栋大楼里上班  我们跟他谈过
<35-10,CASTLE>He works in the building. We spoke to him.

966
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,690
<35-10,CASTLE>我们也许已经露底了
<35-10,CASTLE>We may have already tipped our hand.

967
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,710
<35-11,GATES>除非他也是被人胁迫的
<35-11,GATES>Not if he's being leveraged, too.

968
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:41,320
<35-11,GATES>我们对他了解多少
<35-11,GATES>What do we know about him?

969
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,430
<36-1,RYAN>沃特·丹尼斯  曾在奥尔巴尼[纽约州首府]当过警察
<36-1,RYAN>Walter Dennis. Guy's an ex-cop from Albany.

970
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:47,180
<36-2,GATES>他有没有家人  配偶或是孩子能被人用来胁迫他的
<36-2,GATES>Any family, spouse, or children they can use against him?

971
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:48,790
<36-3,ESPOSITO>没有  这家伙离异无子
<36-3,ESPOSITO>No, guy's divorced. No kids.

972
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:49,960
<36-4,RYAN>听着  丹尼斯十年前由于收受贿赂
<36-4,RYAN>Listen to this. Dennis got fired from

973
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,520
<36-4,RYAN>而被奥尔巴尼警察局开除了
<36-4,RYAN>the Albany police department ten years ago for taking bribes.

974
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,190
<36-6,CASTLE>-他受贿  -没人胁迫他
<36-6,CASTLE>- He's dirty. - They're not leveraging him.

975
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,350
<36-6,CASTLE>他跟他们是一伙的
<36-6,CASTLE>He's in on it.

976
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:58,550
<36-7,BECKETT>如果他跟他们是一伙的  那他就知道我们会怀疑他
<36-7,BECKETT>If he's in on it, then he knows we're onto him.

977
00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:00,580
<36-7,BECKETT>他也许见到我们带走了米兰达
<36-7,BECKETT>He would've seen us taking Miranda.

978
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:02,780
<36-8,CASTLE>他们现在不会现身了  他们会杀掉保罗的
<36-8,CASTLE>They can't come forward now. They're gonna kill Paul.

979
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:08,330
<37-1,BECKETT>丹尼斯没上班  我们一走他就离开了
<37-1,BECKETT>Dennis isn't at work. He left right after we did.

980
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:09,910
<37-2,RYAN>他也不在家
<37-2,RYAN>He's not at his apartment either.

981
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:12,540
<37-3,BECKETT>-他肯定跟保罗在一起  -听着
<37-3,BECKETT>- No, he's wherever Paul is. - Hey, check this out.

982
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,560
<37-4,ESPOSITO>我发现沃特·丹尼斯曾多次打电话
<37-4,ESPOSITO>I found a series of calls between Walter Dennis

983
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:15,860
<37-4,ESPOSITO>给罗曼豪车公司
<37-4,ESPOSITO>and Roman's limo service.

984
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,160
<37-5,BECKETT>正是卡梅隆工作的地方
<37-5,BECKETT>Where Cameron worked.

985
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,830
<37-6,ESPOSITO>丹尼斯往那里打过六次电话
<37-6,ESPOSITO>Dennis called there six times.

986
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:20,170
<37-7,BECKETT>也许是为了策划这次行动
<37-7,BECKETT>Probably to plan the job.

987
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:21,490
<37-8,ESPOSITO>只不过这些电话不是打给卡梅的
<37-8,ESPOSITO>Only they weren't to Cam.

988
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,980
<37-8,ESPOSITO>是这两天打的
<37-8,ESPOSITO>These were made in the last two days.

989
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,410
<37-9,BECKETT>那时候卡梅已经死了  那么
<37-9,BECKETT>After Cam was already dead, so --

990
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:25,560
<37-10,CASTLE>他这是打给谁呢
<37-10,CASTLE>Who was he calling?

991
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:31,500
<38-3,DENNIS>好了  走吧  外面没人
<38-3,DENNIS>Come on. Let's go. It's clear.

992
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:34,940
<38-4,DENNIS>走  带上他
<38-4,DENNIS>Come on. Let's get him.

993
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,350
<38-4,DENNIS>走吧  瓦尔
<38-4,DENNIS>Come on, Vail.

994
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:37,430
<38-4,DENNIS>时间到了
<38-4,DENNIS>Time's up.

995
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:49,280
<38-4,DENNIS>快点  把他塞进去
<38-4,DENNIS>Come on. Get him in.

996
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,030
<38-4,DENNIS>快点  把他塞进去
<38-4,DENNIS>Come on, get him in there.

997
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:52,550
<38-4,DENNIS>把他塞进去  塞到车尾箱里去
<38-4,DENNIS>Get him in, get him in the truck.

998
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,610
<38-4,DENNIS>把他塞进去
<38-4,DENNIS>Get him in.

999
00:38:57,450 --> 00:39:01,020
<38-5,ROMAN>对不起伙计  事已至此  我们别无选择
<38-5,ROMAN>Sorry, pal. The way things stand, we got no other choice.

1000
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:03,380
<38-6,BECKETT>还是有的
<38-6,BECKETT>I think you do.

1001
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:10,680
<38-7,RYAN>跪下
<38-7,RYAN>Come on on your knees.

1002
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:24,410
<39-1,PAUL>我还以为我再也见不到你了呢
<39-1,PAUL>I never thought I'd see you again.

1003
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:25,510
<39-1,PAUL>保罗
<39-1,PAUL>Paul.

1004
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:28,030
<39-2,GATES>本尼在哪
<39-2,GATES>Where's Benny?

1005
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,440
<39-2,GATES>他马上就到
<39-2,GATES>He's on his way up now.

1006
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:32,860
<39-2,GATES>干得漂亮
<39-2,GATES>Nicely done.

1007
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:36,330
<39-3,BECKETT>谢谢  但是卡梅才是真正的英雄
<39-3,BECKETT>Thanks, but, uh, Cam is the real hero here.

1008
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,390
<39-4,GATES>那个司机
<39-4,GATES>The getaway driver?

1009
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:40,330
<39-5,CASTLE>是啊  完全就是盗亦有道
<39-5,CASTLE>Yeah, turns out it was a case of "Honor Among Thieves."

1010
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:42,120
<39-6,ESPOSITO>保罗把整件事都交代了
<39-6,ESPOSITO>Yeah, Paul told us the whole story.

1011
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,410
<39-7,BECKETT>当卡梅的老板罗曼知道了他的情况后
<39-7,BECKETT>When Cam's boss, Roman, found out about his past,

1012
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:46,400
<39-7,BECKETT>逼卡梅接下了这份工作
<39-7,BECKETT>he pressured Cam into the job

1013
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,370
<39-7,BECKETT>威胁他说如果不合作就炒了他
<39-7,BECKETT>and threatened to fire him if he didn't go along.

1014
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:49,430
<39-8,CASTLE>他要毁掉卡梅和妻子
<39-8,CASTLE>He was gonna destroy everything

1015
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:50,840
<39-8,CASTLE>努力建筑的一切
<39-8,CASTLE>he and his wife were trying to build.

1016
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,250
<39-9,ESPOSITO>罗曼向他保证不会有人员伤亡
<39-9,ESPOSITO>Roman promised no one would get hurt,

1017
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:54,430
<39-9,ESPOSITO>但就在他们把电视台彩票球箱掉包后
<39-9,ESPOSITO>but then after the ball exchange at the TV station,

1018
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:56,480
<39-9,ESPOSITO>卡梅偷听到罗曼和沃特·丹尼斯的谈话
<39-9,ESPOSITO>Cam overheard Roman and Walter Dennis talking.

1019
00:39:56,490 --> 00:39:58,400
<39-9,ESPOSITO>说什么要窜逃出境完全是胡说八道
<39-9,ESPOSITO>That whole leaving the country thing was bull.

1020
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,480
<39-9,ESPOSITO>他们根本就没准备留瓦尔一家活口
<39-9,ESPOSITO>They never had any intention of letting the Vails live.

1021
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,010
<39-10,RYAN>没错  在他们去领奖金之前
<39-10,RYAN>Yeah, before collecting the winnings,

1022
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:04,110
<39-10,RYAN>他们计划伪造一场意外  杀掉他们一家三口
<39-10,RYAN>they were gonna stage an accident, killing 'em all.

1023
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:06,610
<39-11,GATES>把他们罪行的唯一证人灭口
<39-11,GATES>Silencing the only witnesses to their crime.

1024
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:08,760
<39-12,CASTLE>卡梅发现真相后  他下不了手
<39-12,CASTLE>When Cam found out, he couldn't live with it.

1025
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:11,100
<39-13,PAUL>他想救我们俩  但被他们抓到了
<39-13,PAUL>He tried to save us both. But they caught him.

1026
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,830
<39-13,PAUL>所以他抱着本尼就跑了
<39-13,PAUL>So he grabbed Benny and ran.

1027
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:15,040
<39-13,PAUL>他为了我们牺牲了自己
<39-13,PAUL>He gave up his life for us.

<39-18,RYAN>I mean, besides saving that family --

1035

<39-18,RYAN>他们准备对这期彩票重新开奖
<39-18,RYAN>they are rolling over the lottery.

<39-18,RYAN>So I got another shot at that $247 million.

1037
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,920

<39-26,CASTLE>我们也会有几个亲生的本尼满屋子跑呢
<39-26,CASTLE>we'll have a couple Bennys of our own running around.

1050
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,820
<39-27,ALEXIS>如果你俩几年后有孩子

00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,730
<39-27,ALEXIS>他们就可以一起长大了
<39-27,ALEXIS>they can grow up together.

1053
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,090
<39-28,CASTLE>美好憧憬就这样毁了
<39-28,CASTLE>And it's ruined.

1054
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:24,840
<39-29,CASTLE>如果我不赶紧回家把火鸡从冰箱里取出来的话
<39-29,CASTLE>And the turkey will be, too, if I don't get it

1055
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,490
<39-29,CASTLE>火鸡也就毁了  走吧  女士们  麻利的
<39-29,CASTLE>out of the freezer. Come on, ladies. Chop, chop.

1056
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:29,150
<40-1,CASTLE>好了

<40-2,MARTHA>这简直是太激动人心了
<40-2,MARTHA>Ooh. Oh, this is so exciting.

1058
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,880
<40-2,MARTHA>咱们的家庭正在飞速地壮大
<40-2,MARTHA>Our family is just growing by leaps and bounds.

1059
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,190
<40-2,MARTHA>亲爱的  如果我们保持这个速度的话
<40-2,MARTHA>If we keep this up, darling,

1060
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:38,660
<40-2,MARTHA>我们很快就要换个大餐桌了
<40-2,MARTHA>we're gonna need a bigger table.

1061
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:41,120
<40-3,CASTLE>再过二十分钟火鸡就能吃了
<40-3,CASTLE>Exactly 20 minutes till turkey time.

1062
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:42,540
<40-4,ALEXIS>派正在过来的路上
<40-4,ALEXIS>Pi is on his way,

1063
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:45,200
<40-4,ALEXIS>贝克特的父亲刚刚也打过电话来  他马上就到了
<40-4,ALEXIS>and Beckett's dad just called. He'll be here any minute.

1064
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,980
<40-5,CASTLE>太好了  那贝克特人呢
<40-5,CASTLE>Excellent. And where's Beckett?

1065
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:52,100
<40-6,MARTHA>凯萨琳
<40-6,MARTHA>Katherine.

1066
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:54,440
<40-6,MARTHA>你这穿着是什么呀
<40-6,MARTHA>What on earth are you wearing?

1067
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:56,860
<40-7,BECKETT>我的服装啊
<40-7,BECKETT>My...outfit.

1068
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:59,330
<40-7,BECKETT>这不是你们的家庭传统吗
<40-7,BECKETT>Your family...tradition.

1069
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:03,020
<40-8,CASTLE>关于这个嘛  你知道这件事上
<40-8,CASTLE>Yeah, uh, you do know I was kidding...

1070
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,270
<40-8,CASTLE>我是在开玩笑的  对吧
<40-8,CASTLE>about that, right?

1071
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:07,760
<40-9,BECKETT>事实上  我还真不知道
<40-9,BECKETT>You know, I actually wasn't sure about that.

1072
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:11,610
<40-9,BECKETT>所以我在想  如果这还不是卡塞尔的家庭传统的话
<40-9,BECKETT>So I figured, if this isn't a Castle family tradition,

1073
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:13,380
<40-9,BECKETT>我们就把它变成新传统
<40-9,BECKETT>then maybe it should be.

1074
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:17,160
<40-9,BECKETT>你最好把这身给我穿上  新教徒
<40-9,BECKETT>Better put this on, pilgrim.
