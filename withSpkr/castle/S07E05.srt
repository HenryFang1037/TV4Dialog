2
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:12,930
<1-1,ABBY SMITH>我11点就得到俱乐部  所以我没时间多说
<1-1,ABBY SMITH>I need to be at the club by 11:00, so I can't really talk.

3
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,310
<1-1,ABBY SMITH>不去
<1-1,ABBY SMITH>Uh skip it?

00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,330
<1-1,ABBY SMITH>我真的得挂了
<1-1,ABBY SMITH>Look, I really got to go.

00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:24,250
<1-1,ABBY SMITH>我会想你的
<1-1,ABBY SMITH>But I'll be thinking about you.

8
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:26,760
<1-1,ABBY SMITH>我会照张照片发你证明我想你
<1-1,ABBY SMITH>I'll take a pic and send it to you to prove it.

<2-5,CASTLE>I thought you said you were just coming to watch, anyway.

26
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:15,670
<2-6,MARTHA>本来是这么打算的
<2-6,MARTHA>Well, that was the plan,

27
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:17,840
<2-6,MARTHA>可我发现你需要我的专业帮助
<2-6,MARTHA>but then I discovered my expertise was needed.

28
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,270
<2-6,MARTHA>别忘了他的额头  亲爱的
<2-6,MARTHA>And don't miss his forehead, honey.

00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,070
<2-8,MARTHA>我不是第一次了  妈妈
<2-8,MARTHA>I've done this before, mother.

00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,410
<2-9,CASTLE>我心里有数的
<2-9,CASTLE>I know exactly what I'm doing.

<2-9,CASTLE>Thank you. Go ahead and just put one more.

00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:30,390
<2-9,CASTLE>加一层书
<2-9,CASTLE>Just another layer.

36
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,670
<2-9,CASTLE>摞起来
<2-9,CASTLE>Stack them right up on top of there.

37
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:32,350
<2-9,CASTLE>我觉得会很棒的
<2-9,CASTLE>I think it'll be great.

38
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:34,520
<2-10,MARTHA>那边有个人在用手机拍你
<2-10,MARTHA>There's a boy over there filming you with his phone.

39
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,610
<2-11,CASTLE>那是什么幕后花絮之类的
<2-11,CASTLE>Yeah, that just behind-the-scenes stuff.

40
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,950

00:01:58,530 --> 00:01:59,790
<2-20,MO>我是理查德·卡塞尔
<2-20,MO>I'm Richard Castle.

<2-21,CASTLE>it'll keep you hooked till the very last word.

58
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,010
<3-1,KATE BECKETT>那一定很尴尬吧
<3-1,KATE BECKETT>That must have been kind of embarrassing.

59
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,940
<3-2,CASTLE>的确有点伤到我的自尊
<3-2,CASTLE>It was a minor blow to my ego.

60
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,430
<3-2,CASTLE>但之后  我向内心的卡塞尔汲取力量
<3-2,CASTLE>But after that, I had to channel my inner Castle.

61
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:33,110
<3-2,CASTLE>之后  便所向披靡
<3-2,CASTLE>But once I did, nailed it.

62
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,160
<3-3,BECKETT>你完美地扮演了自己
<3-3,BECKETT>Wow, you nailed playing yourself.

63
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,020
<3-3,BECKETT>真厉害
<3-3,BECKETT>That's impressive.

64
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,390
<3-4,CASTLE>随你嘲笑吧
<3-4,CASTLE>Eh, mock if you will,

65
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:39,540
<3-4,CASTLE>但很快  你就会在各种平台上
<3-4,CASTLE>but pretty soon, you're gonna see my image

66
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,880
<3-4,CASTLE>看到我的形象了
<3-4,CASTLE>splashed across multiple platforms.

67
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,330
<3-4,CASTLE>就像卡塞尔升级版
<3-4,CASTLE>It's gonna be Castle 2.0.

68
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,720
<3-4,CASTLE>卡塞尔云端版
<3-4,CASTLE>It's gonna be Castle in the cloud.

69
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,440
<3-5,BECKETT>等等  多平台
<3-5,BECKETT>Wait a minute. Multiple platforms?

70
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,340
<3-5,BECKETT>不是电视广告吗
<3-5,BECKETT>I thought that this was a tv commercial.

71
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,500
<3-6,CASTLE>不  比那更好  是网络广告
<3-6,CASTLE>No, better... it's a webmercial.

72
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,910
<3-6,CASTLE>等几天后发行了
<3-6,CASTLE>And once it drops in a few days,

73
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,300
<3-6,CASTLE>我的出版商向我保证  我和《狂怒希特》
<3-6,CASTLE>my publisher assures me that both "Raging Heat" and I

74
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,270
<3-6,CASTLE>都会大热
<3-6,CASTLE>will go viral.

75
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:01,600
<3-6,CASTLE>我也该允许科技给我一个温暖暴赚的拥抱了
<3-6,CASTLE>It's time I let technology wrap me in its warm yet lucrative embrace.

76
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:03,330
<3-8,CASTLE>先生们早
<3-8,CASTLE>Gentlemen.

77
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:04,920
<3-8,CASTLE>有电梯吗  还是得走上去
<3-8,CASTLE>Is there an elevator? Is this a walk-up?

78
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,200
<3-8,CASTLE>希望有电梯
<3-8,CASTLE>Hope it's an elevator.

79
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,770
<4-1,JAVIER ESPOSITO>被害人名叫艾比·史密斯  23岁
<4-1,JAVIER ESPOSITO>Victim's name is Abby Smith. She's 23 years old.

80
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:12,920
<4-1,JAVIER ESPOSITO>一名维修人员今早发现了她
<4-1,JAVIER ESPOSITO>A maintenance worker found her early this morning.

81
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,830
<4-1,JAVIER ESPOSITO>这事很不对劲
<4-1,JAVIER ESPOSITO>We're dealing with something messed up here.

82
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:18,040
<4-2,LANIE PARISH>没错  首先是这些刺伤
<4-2,LANIE PARISH>You got that right, starting off with these stab wounds.

83
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,570
<4-3,CASTLE>是圆形的  凶器是什么
<4-3,CASTLE>They're round. What was the murder weapon?

84
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,670
<4-4,LANIE>不好说
<4-4,LANIE>Hard to tell.

85
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,230
<4-4,LANIE>编织针  或者冰锥
<4-4,LANIE>A knitting needle, maybe, or an ice pick.

86
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,040
<4-4,LANIE>我也猜不准
<4-4,LANIE>Your guess is as good as mine.

87
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:31,160
<4-4,LANIE>她的袭击者懂解剖
<4-4,LANIE>Her attacker knew about anatomy.

88
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,350
<4-4,LANIE>他刺穿了她的颈动脉和锁骨下动脉
<4-4,LANIE>He pierced her carotid and her subclavian arteries.

89
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:35,590
<4-4,LANIE>她数分钟内流血致死
<4-4,LANIE>She bled out in minutes.

90
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,980
<4-5,BECKETT>那么凶手可能有医学背景
<4-5,BECKETT>Which means our killer might have had a medical background.

91
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:41,480
<4-5,BECKETT>这里没有强行闯入的痕迹
<4-5,BECKETT>You know, there are no signs of forced entry.

92
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,300
<4-5,BECKETT>凶手是怎么进来的
<4-5,BECKETT>Do we know how this killer came in?

93
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,380
<4-6,KEVIN RYAN>不能确定
<4-6,KEVIN RYAN>Well, we're not really sure.

94
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:47,580
<4-6,KEVIN RYAN>但他绝对想让艾比知道他来了
<4-6,KEVIN RYAN>But he definitely wanted Abby to know that he was here.

95
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:49,670
<4-6,KEVIN RYAN>这是10:33发给她的照片
<4-6,KEVIN RYAN>She was texted this photo at 10:33,

96
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:50,960
<4-6,KEVIN RYAN>就在死亡时间附近
<4-6,KEVIN RYAN>right around time of death.

97
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,160
<4-7,BECKETT>这是凶手发的
<4-7,BECKETT>The killer sent this?

98
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,450
<4-8,RYAN>就在杀害她之前
<4-8,RYAN>Right before he murdered her.

99
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:56,800
<4-9,CASTLE>他在监视她
<4-9,CASTLE>He was watching her.

100
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,680
<4-9,CASTLE>然后又发来照片吓唬她
<4-9,CASTLE>And then he sent that to terrorize her.

101
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,270
<4-9,CASTLE>这是私人恩怨
<4-9,CASTLE>This was personal.

102
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,130
<4-9,CASTLE>这下科技的拥抱可不温暖了
<4-9,CASTLE>Well, so much for the warm embrace of technology.

103
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:03,330
<4-10,BECKETT>可以追查短信吗
<4-10,BECKETT>Is there any way to trace the text?

104
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,300
<4-11,RYAN>试过了  是一次性手机发来的
<4-11,RYAN>Well, we'll try, but it was sent from a burner phone.

105
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,890
<4-11,RYAN>同时  我们去问下邻居
<4-11,RYAN>Um, meanwhile, we'll check with the neighbors

106
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:07,850
<4-11,RYAN>看他们看见什么没
<4-11,RYAN>and see if they saw anything.

107
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:09,210
<4-12,BECKETT>记得也问下朋友和家人
<4-12,BECKETT>Okay, and talk to friends and family.

108
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:10,320
<4-12,BECKETT>如果这是私人恩怨
<4-12,BECKETT>If this was personal,

109
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,010
<4-12,BECKETT>他们也许会知道与谁有关
<4-12,BECKETT>they might have an idea as to who was behind this.

110
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:13,470
<4-13,RYAN>我们为何不从他开始
<4-13,RYAN>Why don't we start with this guy?

111
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,310
<5-2,RYAN>卡洛斯
<5-2,RYAN>Carlos.

112
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:15,200
<4-13,RYAN>被害人收到信息前
<4-13,RYAN>She was on the phone with him

113
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,900
<4-13,RYAN>刚与他通完电话
<4-13,RYAN>right before she received the text message.

114
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,640
<4-13,RYAN>从通话记录看  他应该是被害者男友
<4-13,RYAN>Judging by their call history, he looks to be the boyfriend.

115
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:22,080
<5-1,CARLOS VILLEGAS>真不敢相信她被杀了
<5-1,CARLOS VILLEGAS>I can't believe this happened.

116
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,020
<5-1,CARLOS VILLEGAS>要是我当时跟她在一起就好了
<5-1,CARLOS VILLEGAS>I should've been there to protect her.

117
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,300
<5-2,RYAN>卡洛斯  我们想问下你
<5-2,RYAN>We have to ask you, Carlos,

118
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:28,260
<5-2,RYAN>还有谁有艾比家的钥匙
<5-2,RYAN>who else had a key to Abby's place?

119
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,340
<5-3,CARLOS>没有别人
<5-3,CARLOS>Nobody.

120
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:30,810
<5-3,CARLOS>除了房东以外
<5-3,CARLOS>Just the landlord.

121
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:33,020
<5-4,ESPOSITO>她是在家等什么客人吗
<5-4,ESPOSITO>You know if she was expecting any visitors?

122
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,370
<5-4,ESPOSITO>没有
<5-4,ESPOSITO>No.

123
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,370
<5-5,CARLOS>她当时正准备去末日俱乐部
<5-5,CARLOS>She was actually heading out to Club Doom.

124
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,190
<5-5,CARLOS>她在那儿有个个人见面会
<5-5,CARLOS>She had booked a personal appearance there.

125
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,930
<5-6,RYAN>艾比是名人吗
<5-6,RYAN>Uh... Abby was a celebrity?

126
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,840
<5-7,CARLOS>她在社交网络上很活跃
<5-7,CARLOS>She was huge on social media.

127
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,800
<5-8,ESPOSITO>她是演员  歌手还是别的
<5-8,ESPOSITO>So, was she an actress or a singer or what?

128
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,220
<5-9,CARLOS>不是   她在Snappamatic上面分享照片
<5-9,CARLOS>No. She posted pics on Snappamatic --

129
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,600
<5-9,CARLOS>就那个照片分享软件
<5-9,CARLOS>You know, the photo-sharing app.

130
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,500
<5-9,CARLOS>她管那叫Snappamatic评论
<5-9,CARLOS>"Snappamatic reviews," She called them.

131
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,530
<5-10,ESPOSITO>上面有她的照片
<5-10,ESPOSITO>And that got her personal appearances?

132
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:53,580
<5-11,CARLOS>还有赞助商
<5-11,CARLOS>Yeah, and sponsors, too,

133
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,640
<5-11,CARLOS>尤其她有五十万粉丝
<5-11,CARLOS>Especially when she hit half a million followers.

134
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,520
<5-12,RYAN>她主要评论些什么
<5-12,RYAN>What did Abby review, exactly?

135
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,540
<5-13,CARLOS>就是段子
<5-13,CARLOS>They were, like, joke reviews.

136
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,000
<5-13,CARLOS>她来纽约是为了成为喜剧演员
<5-13,CARLOS>She came to New York to be a comedian,

137
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,710
<5-13,CARLOS>这就是
<5-13,CARLOS>And, um, this...

138
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,090
<5-13,CARLOS>让她成名的照片
<5-13,CARLOS>is how she hit it big.

139
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:07,950
<5-14,RYAN>这家希腊烤肉难吃得直接吐出来
<5-14,RYAN>"These gyros came right back up.

140
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,940
<5-14,RYAN>这种买一送一你可不会想要
<5-14,RYAN>That's a two-for-one special you don't want."

141
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,510
<5-15,CARLOS>这张照片火了
<5-15,CARLOS>This pic went viral and...

142
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,040
<5-15,CARLOS>一夜之间  她就成了明星
<5-15,CARLOS>Overnight, she was a star,

143
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,980
<5-15,CARLOS>追随者  粉丝  她因此备受关注
<5-15,CARLOS>With followers and fans, all this attention.

144
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:19,020
<5-15,CARLOS>我觉得自己要失去她了
<5-15,CARLOS>I-I felt like I was losing her.

145
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,500
<5-15,CARLOS>感觉已经没有两人空间了
<5-15,CARLOS>Like there was no room left for the two of us.

146
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,050
<5-16,ESPOSITO>有人跟踪她吗
<5-16,ESPOSITO>Do you think she had any stalkers?

147
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,030
<5-17,CARLOS>如果有  她也不一定会告诉我
<5-17,CARLOS>If she did, I'm not sure she would have told me.

148
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,830
<5-18,RYAN>有什么被评论的人
<5-18,RYAN>Did any of these reviewees

149
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,800
<5-18,RYAN>对这些照片表示生气吗
<5-18,RYAN>get upset about the pictures she posted?

150
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,330
<5-19,CARLOS>确实有
<5-19,CARLOS>Actually, yeah.

151
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:34,310
<5-19,CARLOS>有个男的  打过恐吓电话
<5-19,CARLOS>There was a guy -- he made threatening calls.

152
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,310
<5-20,RYAN>他叫什么
<5-20,RYAN>What was his name?

153
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,610
<6-1,ESPOSITO>爱德华·韩.
<6-1,ESPOSITO>Edward Han.

154
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:37,670
<6-2,CASTLE>他是个针灸师
<6-2,CASTLE>He's an acupuncturist.

155
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,880
<6-1,ESPOSITO>他的电话记录显示  艾比死前几天内
<6-1,ESPOSITO>His cellphone records show that he called Abby

156
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:41,950
<6-1,ESPOSITO>他给她打了数十通电话
<6-1,ESPOSITO>a dozen times in the days before her murder.

157
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,660
<6-2,CASTLE>说起精确扎针杀人  没有人
<6-2,CASTLE>And who better than an acupuncturist

158
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:47,060
<6-2,CASTLE>比针灸师更在行了  说不定凶器就是大针头
<6-2,CASTLE>to kill with accurate punctures, perhaps with a giant needle?

159
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,620
<6-3,BECKETT>而且他精通解剖学知道往哪下手
<6-3,BECKETT>And he has the anatomical training to know where to strike.

160
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,020
<6-4,ESPOSITO>更别提艾比还得罪过他
<6-4,ESPOSITO>Not to mention beef with Abby.

161
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,070
<6-4,ESPOSITO>看看这张图
<6-4,ESPOSITO>Check this out.

162
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,730
<6-4,ESPOSITO>现在到处都是
<6-4,ESPOSITO>This was posted all over the place,

163
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:56,390
<6-4,ESPOSITO>我猜对韩的生意打击很大
<6-4,ESPOSITO>And I bet it put a damper on Han's practice.

164
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,200
<6-5,CASTLE>别让这家伙捅你
<6-5,CASTLE>"Do not let this guy poke you."

165
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,000
<6-5,CASTLE>我不明白
<6-5,CASTLE>I don't get it.

166
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,940
<6-6,ESPOSITO>到处上传这种傻B照片
<6-6,ESPOSITO>Posting dumb-ass photos all over the place --

167
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,480
<6-6,ESPOSITO>她是怎么会有粉丝团的
<6-6,ESPOSITO>How did she have a fan base?

168
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,100
<6-6,ESPOSITO>这怎么成就一个事业的
<6-6,ESPOSITO>How did this become a career?

169
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,450
<6-7,CASTLE>欢迎来到分享经济时代
<6-7,CASTLE>Welcome to the sharing economy.

170
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:06,640
<6-8,ESPOSITO>得了  分享过度了
<6-8,ESPOSITO>Yeah, more like over-sharing.

171
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,900
<6-9,BECKETT>真的吗  你反对所有上传裸露照片的女人吗
<6-9,BECKETT>Really? And you're opposed to all photos of over-sharing women?

172
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,590
<6-10,ESPOSITO>那不一样
<6-10,ESPOSITO>That's different.

173
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:15,310
<6-11,RYAN>看来韩真有点可疑
<6-11,RYAN>Han's starting to look good for this.

174
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:18,200
<6-11,RYAN>艾比的一个邻居昨天看见韩在她公寓出现
<6-11,RYAN>One of Abby's neighbors saw him at her apartment yesterday.

175
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,730
<6-12,BECKETT>在她公寓  他去干嘛
<6-12,BECKETT>At her apartment? Doing what?

176
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:22,050
<6-13,RYAN>对她大叫  威胁说  会让她付出代价
<6-13,RYAN>Screaming at her, threatening to "Make her pay"

177
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,650
<6-13,RYAN>直到她砰得关上门
<6-13,RYAN>Till she slammed the door in his face.

178
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,840
<6-14,BECKETT>那么也许他回去表明立场了
<6-14,BECKETT>So maybe he went back to get the last word.

179
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,410
<7-1,EDWARD HAN>我根本没回去过
<7-1,EDWARD HAN>I never went back.

180
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:29,250
<7-1,EDWARD HAN>我承认  我是去过她公寓
<7-1,EDWARD HAN>I admit, I was at her apartment

181
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,220
<7-1,EDWARD HAN>也的确说过那些狠话
<7-1,EDWARD HAN>and I may have said those things.

182
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,340
<7-2,BECKETT>你对这评论很生气
<7-2,BECKETT>You were angry about this review.

183
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,520
<7-2,BECKETT>评论
<7-2,BECKETT>Review?

184
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:36,880
<7-3,HAN>这婊子都没来消费过
<7-3,HAN>That bimbo was never even a client.

185
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,620
<7-3,HAN>自她上传这张照片  我的生意一落千丈
<7-3,HAN>She posted that picture, and my walk-ins dropped off.

186
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,770
<7-3,HAN>她的无良段子毁了我的生意
<7-3,HAN>Her little joke was costing me my business.

187
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:44,150
<7-4,ESPOSITO>在我们看来  那就是作案动机
<7-4,ESPOSITO>Yeah, well, in our business, we call that motive.

188
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:46,240
<7-4,ESPOSITO>昨晚10点30你在哪
<7-4,ESPOSITO>Where were you last night at 10:30?

189
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,130
<7-5,HAN>独自悲伤中
<7-5,HAN>Off drowning my sorrows.

190
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:50,980
<7-5,HAN>我向你发誓  我真没杀她
<7-5,HAN>I swear to you, I did not do this.

191
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,950
<7-5,HAN>但我知道是谁干的
<7-5,HAN>But I know who did.

192
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,250
<7-5,HAN>她有个跟踪者
<7-5,HAN>She had a stalker.

193
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,950
<7-6,ESPOSITO>我知道  我们正看着他呢
<7-6,ESPOSITO>Yeah, I know. We're looking at him.

194
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:58,870
<7-7,HAN>不是我  艾比也以为我在跟踪她
<7-7,HAN>Not me. That's what Abby thought, too -- that I was stalking her.

195
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,020
<7-8,ESPOSITO>她为什么会这样想呢
<7-8,ESPOSITO>Now, why would she think that?

196
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,800
<7-8,ESPOSITO>或许是因为你整天打她电话
<7-8,ESPOSITO>Maybe because you were calling her all the time,

197
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,740
<7-8,ESPOSITO>还去她公寓找她
<7-8,ESPOSITO>showing up at her place?

198
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:05,910
<7-9,HAN>艾比说从上个月开始就有人在跟踪她
<7-9,HAN>Abby said someone had been following her for the last month,

199
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:07,740
<7-9,HAN>但我是上周才找到她的
<7-9,HAN>But I didn't track her down till a week ago.

200
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,520
<7-9,HAN>所以跟踪狂不可能是我
<7-9,HAN>So the stalker couldn't have been me.

201
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,840
<7-10,BECKETT>韩先生  你什么证据证明
<7-10,BECKETT>Mr. Han, do you have evidence

202
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,670
<7-10,BECKETT>你说的这人真实存在
<7-10,BECKETT>that this other person actually exists?

203
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,140
<7-11,HAN>明信片上有段话
<7-11,HAN>There's a note on a postcard.

204
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,550
<7-12,BECKETT>-什么话  -一段恐吓的话
<7-12,BECKETT>- What note? - A threat.

205
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:20,310
<7-13,HAN>她死的那天收到的
<7-13,HAN>She got it that day.

206
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:21,750
<7-13,HAN>她拿出来给我看
<7-13,HAN>She waved it in my face.

207
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,030
<7-13,HAN>说是我偷偷塞进她门里
<7-13,HAN>She accused me of slipping it under her door.

208
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:26,350
<7-13,HAN>留下那段话的人就是凶手
<7-13,HAN>Whoever left that note -- that's who did this.

209
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:27,640
<7-13,HAN>一定是
<7-13,HAN>It has to be.

210
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:33,170
<8-1,BECKETT>韩的不在场证明查实了
<8-1,BECKETT>Han's alibi checks out.

211
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:36,550
<8-1,BECKETT>酒保说案发时他正在享受他的第四杯鸡尾酒
<8-1,BECKETT>Bartender said he was well into his fourth mai tai at the time of the murder.

212
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:38,490
<8-2,CASTLE>再仔细想想
<8-2,CASTLE>Upon reflection, it's just as well

213
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:40,240
<8-2,CASTLE>从讲故事的立场来说
<8-2,CASTLE>from a storytelling standpoint.

214
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,580
<8-2,CASTLE>刚说完"别让这家伙捅你"
<8-2,CASTLE>I mean, "Do not let this guy poke you,"

215
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:45,000
<8-2,CASTLE>然后针灸师就拿着根大针捅死她
<8-2,CASTLE>then the acupuncturist stabs her with a giant needle.

216
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,600
<8-2,CASTLE>这有点明显过头了
<8-2,CASTLE>It's just a little too obvious.

217
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,960
<8-3,BECKETT>也就是说我们要找另一个有动机的人
<8-3,BECKETT>Which means we're looking for someone else with motive,

218
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,800
<8-3,BECKETT>但目前为止  没人浮出来
<8-3,BECKETT>But so far, no one sticks out.

219
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,490
<8-4,CASTLE>也许艾比的家人有什么想法
<8-4,CASTLE>Maybe Abby's family has some insight.

220
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:55,030
<8-5,BECKETT>没有  她跟他们不是很亲密
<8-5,BECKETT>They don't. She wasn't very close to them.

221
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,910
<8-6,ESPOSITO>看来韩说的威胁的事是真的
<8-6,ESPOSITO>Looks like Han was telling the truth about that threat.

222
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:00,900
<8-6,ESPOSITO>鉴证组在艾比的梳妆台抽屉里找到了这张明信片
<8-6,ESPOSITO>CSU Found this postcard in Abby's dresser drawer.

223
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,620
<8-7,BECKETT>"最亮的星星也是最快逝去的"
<8-7,BECKETT>"The brightest stars burn quickest."

224
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:08,190
<8-8,CASTLE>这是她被杀当天收到的吗
<8-8,CASTLE>She got this on the same day she was murdered?

225
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,310
<8-9,BECKETT>等等  这是指纹吗
<8-9,BECKETT>Wait, is this a fingerprint?

226
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:13,200
<8-10,ESPOSITO>不  只是块污渍  但也许是线索
<8-10,ESPOSITO>No. That's a smudge, but it might mean something.

227
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,990
<8-10,ESPOSITO>实验室说是木材清漆
<8-10,ESPOSITO>The lab says that it's wood varnish.

228
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:17,140
<8-11,RYAN>伙计们  看看这个
<8-11,RYAN>Hey, guys. Check this out.

229
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,240
<8-12,RYAN>我查了艾比的粉丝
<8-12,RYAN>I was looking through Abby's followers,

230
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,610
<8-12,RYAN>有个人在自己的账号上发了她的照片
<8-12,RYAN>And one of them posted pictures of her on their account.

231
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,230
<8-13,ESPOSITO>犯罪现场的照片
<8-13,ESPOSITO>Crime-scene photos?

232
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:31,340
<8-14,BECKETT>但不是我们的
<8-14,BECKETT>But not ours.

233
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,050
<8-14,BECKETT>凶手在我们到达现场前
<8-14,BECKETT>The killer took these photos

234
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:34,740
<8-14,BECKETT>拍下了这些照片
<8-14,BECKETT>before we got to the crime scene.

235
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,340
<8-15,CASTLE>"这颗明星的耀眼时刻过去了"
<8-15,CASTLE>"This star's 15 seconds are over."

236
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,330
<8-16,BECKETT>这是谁的账号
<8-16,BECKETT>Whose account is this?

237
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:40,180
<8-16,BECKETT>用户名叫"网络杀手"
<8-16,BECKETT>Username is "Net slayer."

247
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,930
<9-1,ESPOSITO>他杀了她  然后晒出了她的照片
<9-1,ESPOSITO>He kills her, then posts her picture.

248
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:57,390
<9-1,ESPOSITO>他为什么这么做
<9-1,ESPOSITO>Why would he do that?

249
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,770
<9-2,CASTLE>毁掉被害人形象  再施以侮辱
<9-2,CASTLE>Well, tear down the victim, add insult to injury.

250
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:01,950
<9-2,CASTLE>"这颗明星的耀眼时刻过去了"
<9-2,CASTLE>"This star's 15 seconds are over."

251
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:03,550
<9-2,CASTLE>也许这就是他杀艾比的原因
<9-2,CASTLE>Maybe that's why he killed Abby,

252
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,840
<9-2,CASTLE>因为她是网络红人
<9-2,CASTLE>Because she was a web celebrity.

253
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,480
<9-3,RYAN>也可能他自己也想红
<9-3,RYAN>Or he wants to become one himself.

254
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,580
<9-4,CASTLE>艾比可有五十万粉丝
<9-4,CASTLE>Abby did have half a million followers.

255
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,490
<9-4,CASTLE>杀了她会让他立马受到关注
<9-4,CASTLE>Killing her would give him instant high profile.

256
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:12,160
<9-5,BECKETT>也可能他只是在利用社交媒体
<9-5,BECKETT>Or he could just be using social media

257
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,900
<9-5,BECKETT>来掩盖他真实的作案动机
<9-5,BECKETT>to hide his true motives for killing her.

258
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,540
<9-5,BECKETT>不管怎样  也许这些照片能帮我们找到他
<9-5,BECKETT>Either way, maybe these photos could help us find him.

259
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,230
<9-6,ESPOSITO>嗯  我去找托瑞分析一下这些照片
<9-6,ESPOSITO>Yeah, I'll get with Tory. We'll analyze the photos,

260
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:19,910
<9-6,ESPOSITO>看能不能从倒影里提取出人像
<9-6,ESPOSITO>see if we can pull some images off the reflections.

261
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,880
<9-7,RYAN>我再查查他的账号
<9-7,RYAN>And I'll go through his account,

262
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,610
<9-7,RYAN>看有没有其他内容能帮我们确认他的身份
<9-7,RYAN>see if he posted anything else that could help us I.D. Him.

263
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:25,670
<9-7,RYAN>你们去哪
<9-7,RYAN>Where you guys going?

264
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:26,560
<9-8,BECKETT>直接去源头
<9-8,BECKETT>Straight to the source...

265
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,230
<9-8,BECKETT>也许snappamatic能告诉我们
<9-8,BECKETT>Maybe Snappamatic can give us an idea

266
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:30,190
<9-8,BECKETT>他是谁  或者去哪找他
<9-8,BECKETT>Who he is or where to find him.

267
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:35,370
<10-1,KENT WILDER>其实  确认用户身份和对其定位
<10-1,KENT WILDER>Actually, ID'ing and locating users

268
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:36,790
<10-1,KENT WILDER>恰恰是我们不能做的两件事
<10-1,KENT WILDER>are two things we just can't do.

269
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:39,060
<10-2,BECKETT>不能还是不想
<10-2,BECKETT>Can't or won't?

270
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:39,760
<10-2,BECKETT>不能
<10-2,BECKETT>Can't.

271
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:41,860
<10-3,OREN WILDER>Snappamatic是基于保护隐私而设计
<10-3,OREN WILDER>Snappamatic was designed for privacy.

272
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,300
<10-3,OREN WILDER>它运行的软件平台
<10-3,OREN WILDER>It runs on a software platform

273
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,190
<10-3,OREN WILDER>会将所有用户匿名
<10-3,OREN WILDER>that anonymizes all of our users.

274
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:47,460
<10-4,CASTLE>这对凶手来说肯定是最满意的一点
<10-4,CASTLE>I bet that was a real selling point for the killer.

275
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:51,430
<10-5,OREN>听着  没人比我们更恼火这事了
<10-5,OREN>Look, no one is more upset about this than we are.

276
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:53,280
<10-6,BECKETT>艾比·史密斯肯定更恼火
<10-6,BECKETT>I bet Abby Smith was.

277
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,610
<10-6,BECKETT>你们的一个用户杀了她
<10-6,BECKETT>One of your users killed her,

278
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,510
<10-6,BECKETT>而你们却想告诉我你们帮不上忙
<10-6,BECKETT>and you're trying to tell me that you can't help us.

279
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:59,800
<10-7,KENT>我们在尽力  伊万在梳理这家伙的账号
<10-7,KENT>We're trying. Evan's combing the guy's account,

280
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,930
<10-7,KENT>可注册咱们网站只要一个有效的电邮地址就行
<10-7,KENT>but all you need to register is a valid e-mail address.

281
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:05,040
<10-8,EVAN>他的电邮现在已经不可用了  所以毫无帮助
<10-8,EVAN>Which isn't valid anymore, by the way, so no help there.

282
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,820
<10-9,OREN>我们只能封掉他的账号  让他不能再发东西
<10-9,OREN>What we can do is suspend his account so he can't post.

283
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,870
<10-10,CASTLE>好吧  他之所以会发东西
<10-10,CASTLE>Uh, well, the reason he's posting in the first place

284
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:11,170
<10-10,CASTLE>是想获得关注
<10-10,CASTLE>is because he wants attention.

285
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,950
<10-10,CASTLE>-他需要交流  -没错
<10-10,CASTLE>- He needs to communicate. - Exactly.

286
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:14,460
<10-11,BECKETT>他喜欢分享  那就让他分享
<10-11,BECKETT>He likes to share, so let him.

287
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:17,100
<10-11,BECKETT>也许他会无意中分享出什么东西
<10-11,BECKETT>Maybe he's gonna share something that he didn't intend to.

288
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,540
<10-11,BECKETT>把图片撤下来  但别封他的号
<10-11,BECKETT>Now, take the pictures down but leave the account up.

289
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,990
<10-12,OREN>我们不希望网站的品牌
<10-12,OREN>W-we'd rather not have the snappamatic brand

290
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,370
<10-12,OREN>跟一个杀人凶手扯上关系
<10-12,OREN>associated with a murderer.

291
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:25,620
<10-13,BECKETT>已经扯上了
<10-13,BECKETT>It already is.

292
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,650
<10-13,BECKETT>这是我们直通凶手的管道
<10-13,BECKETT>It's our pipeline directly to the killer.

293
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:29,470
<10-13,BECKETT>账号不准封
<10-13,BECKETT>The account stays open.

294
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:31,110
<10-14,CASTLE>往好处想想  先生们
<10-14,CASTLE>Coider the bright side, gentlemen...

295
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,410
<10-14,CASTLE>你们网站的浏览量会破表的
<10-14,CASTLE>The traffic for your site will be through the roof.

296
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:36,200
<10-15,EVAN>我好像有发现了
<10-15,EVAN>I think I got something.

297
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:39,990
<10-15,EVAN>我在挖掘元数据
<10-15,EVAN>I was digging through the metadata

298
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:42,970
<10-15,EVAN>发现其中一张图片上有异常的地理标签
<10-15,EVAN>and found a GeoTag anomaly on one of the pictures.

299
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:44,260
<10-16,BECKETT>什么样的异常
<10-16,BECKETT>What kind of an anomaly?

300
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:46,600
<10-17,EVAN>是这样  地理标签包含了GPS坐标
<10-17,EVAN>Okay, so, the GeoTag holds GPS coordinates,

301
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,480
<10-17,EVAN>通常也就是照片被拍摄的地点
<10-17,EVAN>Usually of where a photo was taken.

302
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,720
<10-18,CASTLE>通常  但并不一定吗
<10-18,CASTLE>Usually but not always?

303
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,930
<10-19,EVAN>如果相机失去了GPS信号就不行
<10-19,EVAN>Not if the camera loses its GPS signal.

304
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:52,820
<10-19,EVAN>这样的话
<10-19,EVAN>In that case,

305
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,390
<10-19,EVAN>地理标签就会指向照片被上传的地点
<10-19,EVAN>A GeoTag is assigned when the photo is uploaded.

306
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:57,810
<10-20,CASTLE>所以  凶手没注意到他失去了GPS信号
<10-20,CASTLE>So, the killer lost his GPS signal, didn't notice...

307
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:00,160
<10-21,BECKETT>然后当他上传照片时
<10-21,BECKETT>and then when he posted his photos onto snappamatic,

308
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,820
<10-21,BECKETT>就意外地泄漏了他的位置
<10-21,BECKETT>he accidentally revealed his location.

309
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,670
<10-21,BECKETT>坐标是什么
<10-21,BECKETT>Wh-what are the coordinates?

310
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,500
<11-1,ESPOSITO>托瑞标出了地理标签的经纬度
<11-1,ESPOSITO>Tory plotted the longitude and latitude of the GeoTag,

311
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,320
<11-1,ESPOSITO>得到了一个在曼哈顿市区的地址
<11-1,ESPOSITO>and we got an address in downtown Manhattan.

312
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:09,490
<11-2,BECKETT>是什么地方
<11-2,BECKETT>And what's there?

313
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:11,450
<11-3,ESPOSITO>是个木制家具店
<11-3,ESPOSITO>It's a vintage furniture store.

314
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:12,600
<11-4,CASTLE>木...木材清漆
<11-4,CASTLE>W-w-wood...wood...wood varnish.

315
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,080
<11-4,CASTLE>这就跟纸上的污渍对上了
<11-4,CASTLE>That explains the smudge on the note.

316
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,880
<11-5,BECKETT>好  去拿到那里所有员工的姓名
<11-5,BECKETT>Okay, let's get the names of everyone that works there.

317
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,910
<11-6,ESPOSITO>已经去过了
<11-6,ESPOSITO>We already did.

318
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:19,470
<11-6,ESPOSITO>是家个体经营的店  店主叫比尔·加瑞特
<11-6,ESPOSITO>It's a one-man shop owned by one Bill Garrett.

319
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,540
<11-6,ESPOSITO>他以前是个警察
<11-6,ESPOSITO>Turns out he used to be a cop

320
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:22,020
<11-6,ESPOSITO>直到发生精神崩溃
<11-6,ESPOSITO>until he had a nervous breakdown.

321
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:24,940
<11-6,ESPOSITO>还有  他在网络部工作
<11-6,ESPOSITO>And get this -- he worked in the cyber division.

322
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:28,290
<11-7,CASTLE>这就意味着他很懂网络和社交媒体
<11-7,CASTLE>Which means he would know his way around the web and social media.

323
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:29,330
<11-8,BECKETT>带他来问话
<11-8,BECKETT>Bring him in.

325
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,330
<12-1,RYAN>比尔·加瑞特  纽约警局
<12-1,RYAN>Bill Garrett. NYPD.

326
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:35,680
<12-1,RYAN>举起手让我们看到
<12-1,RYAN>Keep your hands where we can see them.

327
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,820
<12-2,ESPOSITO>跪下  你知道流程的
<12-2,ESPOSITO>On your knees. You know the drill.

328
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,130
<13-1,BILL GARRETT>被抓来警局是退休警员应得的待遇吗
<13-1,BILL GARRETT>Getting brought in here is no way to treat a fellow officer.

329
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:54,460
<13-2,BECKETT>加瑞特先生  我们在你的商店里搜到了这些
<13-2,BECKETT>Mr. Garrett, we found these when we searched your shop.

330
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,830
<13-3,GARRETT>我是做家具翻修的  我当然有钻头
<13-3,GARRETT>I re-finish furniture. Of course I have awls.

331
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:01,820
<13-4,BECKETT>和她颈上的伤口吻合的钻头吗
<13-4,BECKETT>Awls that match the stab wounds in her neck?

332
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:04,610
<13-5,GARRETT>如果你认为是我杀害了这个女孩
<13-5,GARRETT>If you think I murdered this girl,

333
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:05,890
<13-5,GARRETT>那你一定是疯了
<13-5,GARRETT>you're out of your mind.

334
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,060
<13-6,BECKETT>我们还发现了这部手机
<13-6,BECKETT>We also found this cellphone.

335
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,770
<13-7,GARRETT>-买来以防万一的  -以防万一
<13-7,GARRETT>- Keep it for emergencies. - Emergencies?

336
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:12,760
<13-8,BECKETT>以防需要拍照吗
<13-8,BECKETT>Like, uh, snapping photos?

337
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,470
<13-9,BECKETT>你看  就算你删除了它们
<13-9,BECKETT>You see, even when you delete them,

338
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,360
<13-9,BECKETT>还是可以还原的
<13-9,BECKETT>they can still be recovered.

339
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:22,550
<13-10,GARRETT>这是搞什么啊  不是我拍的
<13-10,GARRETT>All right, what is this? I didn't take those.

340
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,620
<13-11,BECKETT>那为什么会出现在你的手机里
<13-11,BECKETT>Then how did they end up on your phone?

341
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,810
<13-11,BECKETT>而且为什么是从你的无线网
<13-11,BECKETT>And why were they uploaded to Snappamatic

342
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:28,370
<13-11,BECKETT>上传到Snappamatic上的
<13-11,BECKETT>using your wifi network?

343
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:29,580
<13-12,GARRETT>我从来不上传照片
<13-12,GARRETT>I don't upload photos.

344
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,370
<13-12,GARRETT>除非必要  我都不上网的
<13-12,GARRETT>I don't even go near the web unless I have to.

345
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:32,930
<13-13,BECKETT>还有发给艾比的信息
<13-13,BECKETT>And then there's the text to Abby

346
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:35,140
<13-13,BECKETT>这张明信片上的木材清漆
<13-13,BECKETT>and the wood varnish on this note,

347
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:37,610
<13-13,BECKETT>只要检查  肯定会发现来自你的商店
<13-13,BECKETT>which we're gonna trace right back to your shop.

348
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:38,870
<13-13,BECKETT>结束了
<13-13,BECKETT>It's over.

349
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,610
<13-13,BECKETT>你最好的选择就是认罪签协议
<13-13,BECKETT>Your best bet is to cut a deal.

350
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:43,740
<13-14,GARRETT>你们搞错了
<13-14,GARRETT>This is a mistake.

351
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:49,180
<13-15,BECKETT>在网络部工作肯定对你造成了巨大伤害吧
<13-15,BECKETT>Working cyber unit must have taken its toll.

352
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,950
<13-15,BECKETT>你一定很不容易
<13-15,BECKETT>It had to have been difficult.

353
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,610
<13-15,BECKETT>亲眼见证着网络的阴暗面
<13-15,BECKETT>Seeing the darkest side of the web --

354
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:54,250
<13-15,BECKETT>肯定对你有所改变吧
<13-15,BECKETT>that must have changed you.

355
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,330
<13-15,BECKETT>也许这就是你辞职并干下这种事的原因
<13-15,BECKETT>Maybe that's why you left and did what you did.

356
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:58,650
<13-16,GARRETT>我什么也没干
<13-16,GARRETT>I didn't do anything.

357
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:01,420
<13-16,GARRETT>我辞职是因为一个兄弟会成员约会强暴了一个女孩
<13-16,GARRETT>And I quit cyber because a frat boy date-raped a girl,

358
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,250
<13-16,GARRETT>把照片发到了网上  还逍遥法外
<13-16,GARRETT>posted the photos online, and got away with it,

359
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,490
<13-16,GARRETT>所以我失控暴怒  打伤了他
<13-16,GARRETT>so I flipped out and I put him in the hospital.

360
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,400
<13-16,GARRETT>我没有伤害这个女孩
<13-16,GARRETT>I did not hurt this girl.

361
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:09,860
<13-16,GARRETT>我都不知道她是谁
<13-16,GARRETT>I do not know her.

362
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:11,640
<13-17,BECKETT>你昨晚10点30分左右在哪里
<13-17,BECKETT>Where were you at 10:30 P.M.?

363
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,480
<13-18,GARRETT>-在家  -和谁在一起
<13-18,GARRETT>- I was at home. - With who?

364
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,740
<13-19,BECKETT>没人
<13-19,BECKETT>Nobody.

365
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,550
<13-20,GARRETT>我独居
<13-20,GARRETT>I was alone.

366
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,500
<14-1,ESPOSITO>这刚刚发布在网络杀手的账号上
<14-1,ESPOSITO>This was just posted to the Net Slayer's account.

367
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:38,250
<14-2,BECKETT>是你们逮捕加瑞特的画面
<14-2,BECKETT>That's you guys arresting Garrett.

368
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:40,980
<14-3,ESPOSITO>等等  这是什么
<14-3,ESPOSITO>Wait, what's this?

369
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:43,380
<14-4,BECKETT>抓错人了  纽约警局
<14-4,BECKETT>"Wrong suspect, NYPD.

370
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,960
<14-4,BECKETT>我还在
<14-4,BECKETT>"I'm still here.

371
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:46,730
<14-4,BECKETT>接下来我要干什么呢
<14-4,BECKETT>What will I do next?"

372
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:48,050
<14-5,CASTLE>要么是加瑞特被陷害了
<14-5,CASTLE>So, either Garrett was framed...

373
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:49,150
<14-6,ESPOSITO>要么就是他用什么办法
<14-6,ESPOSITO>Or somehow, he pulled this off

374
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:51,010
<14-6,ESPOSITO>制造了自己被陷害的假象
<14-6,ESPOSITO>to make it look like he was framed.

375
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:54,600
<14-7,BECKETT>不管这人是谁  他把这事提升到了全新的高度
<14-7,BECKETT>Whoever this is, he just took this to a whole new level.

376
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,390
<14-7,BECKETT>他在嘲弄我们
<14-7,BECKETT>He's taunting us.

377
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,200
<14-8,ESPOSITO>又有图片发布了
<14-8,ESPOSITO>More pictures are coming in.

378
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:00,360
<14-9,BECKETT>这是人体吗
<14-9,BECKETT>Body parts?

379
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:10,870
<14-10,ESPOSITO>人体  香肠  一个日期
<14-10,ESPOSITO>Body parts, sausages, a date.

380
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:11,760
<14-10,ESPOSITO>这到底是什么啊
<14-10,ESPOSITO>What the hell is this?

381
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,580
<14-11,CASTLE>游戏开始了
<14-11,CASTLE>"The game is on."

382
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,170
<14-11,CASTLE>这是个挑战  那些是线索
<14-11,CASTLE>That's a challenge. Those are clues.

383
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:15,280
<14-12,ESPOSITO>什么的线索
<14-12,ESPOSITO>Clues to what?

384
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,400
<14-13,BECKETT>下一次谋杀
<14-13,BECKETT>His next murder.

385
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:28,900
<15-1,CASTLE>人体  香肠  11月12号
<15-1,CASTLE>Body parts, sausage, november 12th.

386
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:32,430
<15-1,CASTLE>把人体做成香肠
<15-1,CASTLE>Body parts being made into sausage.

387
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:37,040
<15-1,CASTLE>11月的人肉香肠
<15-1,CASTLE>Human sausages in november.

388
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,830
<15-1,CASTLE>完全摸不到头绪
<15-1,CASTLE>I am not getting anywhere with this.

389
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:42,170
<15-2,BECKETT>你确定吗  好的  谢谢
<15-2,BECKETT>And you're sure? Okay. Thanks.

390
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,320
<15-2,BECKETT>加瑞特的不在场证明有效
<15-2,BECKETT>Garrett's alibi checks out.

391
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,230
<15-2,BECKETT>他昨晚回家后开启了报警系统
<15-2,BECKETT>He activated his alarm system when he got home last night,

392
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:50,300
<15-2,BECKETT>之后直到早上都再无人进出过
<15-2,BECKETT>and no one entered or exited until morning.

393
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,710
<15-3,CASTLE>所以凶手陷害了他  就为了耍我们
<15-3,CASTLE>So the killer set him up just to toy with us.

394
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:56,440
<15-4,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>警探  新闻媒体要求我们做出回应
<15-4,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>Detective, the news media's calling for comment.

395
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,540
<15-4,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>总局想知道我们的意见
<15-4,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>1PP wants to know what we think this is.

396
00:14:58,540 --> 00:14:59,460
<15-4,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>现在还不能下定论
<15-4,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>We're not sure.

397
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:02,930
<15-5,BECKETT>这可能是指向下一个或几个被害人的线索
<15-5,BECKETT>This could be a clue as to his next victim or victims.

398
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,850
<15-5,BECKETT>每张图可能都代表不同的人
<15-5,BECKETT>Each image could represent a different person.

399
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:06,520
<15-6,CASTLE>也可能是种图形符号
<15-6,CASTLE>Or it could be a pictogram,

400
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,360
<15-6,CASTLE>所有图片合起来能传递某个信息
<15-6,CASTLE>where the images add up to a message.

401
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:11,080
<15-7,BECKETT>托瑞正在分析图像  看能不能查到来源
<15-7,BECKETT>Tory's trying to analyze each image, find their sources.

402
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,990
<15-7,BECKETT>但我们认为这组剪贴画
<15-7,BECKETT>But we think that this collage

403
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:16,200
<15-7,BECKETT>来自一张20多岁白人女性的照片
<15-7,BECKETT>is from one photo of a woman, Caucasian, in her 20s.

404
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,940
<15-8,GATES>那么她可能就是下一个目标
<15-8,GATES>So she could be our next target.

405
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,360
<15-9,CASTLE>鉴于凶手的行为
<15-9,CASTLE>And given the killer's behavior,

406
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,420
<15-9,CASTLE>她很可能是一个网络达人
<15-9,CASTLE>she's most likely someone with a high internet profile,

407
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,710
<15-9,CASTLE>就像艾比·史密斯
<15-9,CASTLE>like Abby Smith.

408
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,040
<15-10,ESPOSITO>我们确认那个烤炉是富勒烤架
<15-10,ESPOSITO>So, we I.D'd that grill as a Fowler.

409
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,490
<15-10,ESPOSITO>我们在查找所有在社交媒体上
<15-10,ESPOSITO>We're checking into anybody named Fowler

410
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:29,150
<15-10,ESPOSITO>比较火的名叫富勒的人
<15-10,ESPOSITO>who might be big on social media.

411
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:33,250
<15-11,GATES>日期11月12号  有特殊含义吗
<15-11,GATES>And that date, november 12th -- any special significance?

412
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:36,390
<15-12,RYAN>首先  它是世界肺炎日
<15-12,RYAN>Well, for starters, it turns out it is world pneumonia day.

413
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:38,420
<15-12,RYAN>不过我们还在寻找相关的新闻事件
<15-12,RYAN>But we're also checking into any news events,

414
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,320
<15-12,RYAN>和那天的出生和死亡
<15-12,RYAN>births, deaths that occurred on that day.

415
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,990
<15-13,CASTLE>如果说那真是个日期的话
<15-13,CASTLE>If it even is a date.

416
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:44,360
<15-13,CASTLE>11  12  13可能是个序列
<15-13,CASTLE>11, 12, 13 could be part of a number sequence.

417
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,140
<15-14,RYAN>没错  卡塞尔  我们也调查了这方面
<15-14,RYAN>Yes, Castle, we're also looking into that,

418
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:48,610
<15-14,RYAN>还有加瑞特在网络部期间抓到的犯人
<15-14,RYAN>as well as anyone Garrett put away while he was in cyber.

419
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:49,800
<15-15,TORY ELLIS>贝克特探长
<15-15,TORY ELLIS>Detective Beckett?

420
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,110
<16-1,TORY>我查到了其中一副图像
<16-1,TORY>I was able to identify one of the images.

421
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,100
<16-2,TORY>是这位美食博主玛丽·弗斯的
<16-2,TORY>It was cropped from this photo of a food blogger

422
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,740
<16-2,TORY>一张照片中截取的
<16-2,TORY>named Mary Fuchs.

423
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,080
<16-3,BECKETT>你从哪找到的这张照片
<16-3,BECKETT>Where did you find that photo?

424
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:07,170
<16-4,TORY>她几天前上传到Snappamatic上的
<16-4,TORY>She posted it on her Snappamatic feed a few days ago.

425
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:10,730
<16-5,CASTLE>玛丽·弗斯是Snappamatic的用户  和艾比·史密斯一样
<16-5,CASTLE>So Mary Fuchs is a Snappamatic user, just like Abby Smith.

426
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:12,050
<16-5,CASTLE>她可能是下个受害者
<16-5,CASTLE>She could be next.

427
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:14,000
<16-6,BECKETT>我们得找到她  把她带过来
<16-6,BECKETT>We need to find her and bring her in here.

428
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,080
<17-1,MARY FUCHS>我不明白
<17-1,MARY FUCHS>I don't understand.

429
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,590
<17-1,MARY FUCHS>为什么会有人截取上传我的一张照片
<17-1,MARY FUCHS>Why would someone post part of my picture?

430
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:20,720
<17-2,BECKETT>弗斯女士  这些图片能让你想起什么吗
<17-2,BECKETT>Ms. Fuchs, do these images mean anything to you?

431
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,320
<17-2,BECKETT>这个日期呢
<17-2,BECKETT>Or this date?

432
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,800
<17-2,BECKETT>不知道
<17-2,BECKETT>No.

433
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,470
<17-3,MARY>我应该不知道
<17-3,MARY>I mean, I don't think so.

434
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:28,960
<17-4,CASTLE>那艾比·史密斯呢  你认识她吗
<17-4,CASTLE>What about Abby Smith? Do you know her?

435
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,950
<17-4,CASTLE>你跟她有什么关系吗
<17-4,CASTLE>Do you have any connection to her?

436
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:33,570
<17-5,MARY>在她被杀的消息上新闻之前
<17-5,MARY>I-I'd never even heard of her

437
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:35,730
<17-5,MARY>我都从来没听说过这个人
<17-5,MARY>till it was all over the news that she died.

438
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,730
<17-5,MARY>杀她的凶手也要杀我吗
<17-5,MARY>Is whoever killed her after me?

439
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:39,920
<17-6,BECKETT>有人跟踪过你吗
<17-6,BECKETT>Well, has anyone been following you?

440
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,430
<17-6,BECKETT>你受到过威胁信件吗
<17-6,BECKETT>Have you received any threatening messages?

441
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:44,520
<17-7,MARY>没有  没有那种事
<17-7,MARY>No, nothing like that.

442
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:45,980
<17-8,CASTLE>你是博主  对吧
<17-8,CASTLE>You're a blogger, right?

443
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,250
<17-8,CASTLE>你的博客是关于什么的
<17-8,CASTLE>What do you blog about?

444
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,660
<17-10,BECKETT>德国菜肴
<17-10,BECKETT>German cuisine.

445
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:49,680
<17-10,BECKETT>德国菜肴
<17-10,BECKETT>German cuisine?

446
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,220
<17-11,MARY>我是德国人  所以我给德国餐厅做点评
<17-11,MARY>I'm German, so I review German restaurants,

447
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,860
<17-11,MARY>而且我也发一些经典菜品的食谱  比如果馅卷
<17-11,MARY>and I post recipes for classic dishes like strudel and --

448
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:59,860
<17-11,MARY>还有图片中我正在烤的小香肠
<17-11,MARY>and the bratwurst that I'm grilling in the picture.

449
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:02,680
<17-12,BECKETT>你的Snappamatic主页上显示你有...
<17-12,BECKETT>So, your Snappamatic page says that you have...

450
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,450
<17-12,BECKETT>47名粉丝
<17-12,BECKETT>47 followers?

451
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:07,420
<17-12,BECKETT>是的
<17-12,BECKETT>Yeah.

452
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:10,640
<17-13,MARY>我上周才加入的  这已经很好了
<17-13,MARY>I think that's pretty good, considering I joined last week.

453
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,150
<17-13,MARY>我不明白
<17-13,MARY>I don't get it.

454
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:16,380
<18-1,CASTLE>杀了艾比让网络杀手进入到公众视野
<18-1,CASTLE>Killing Abby put the Net Slayer onto the big stage.

455
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:19,760
<18-1,CASTLE>嘲讽警察又让他受到瞩目
<18-1,CASTLE>Taunting the police about it just turned on the klieg lights.

456
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,190
<18-1,CASTLE>可现在为什么要选择这个没名气的呢
<18-1,CASTLE>Why target a no-name like her?

457
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:24,920
<18-2,BECKETT>或许他是想告诉大家没人是安全的
<18-2,BECKETT>Maybe he's trying to send a message that no one's safe,

458
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:28,680
<18-2,BECKETT>无论是网络名人还是无名的德国美食博主
<18-2,BECKETT>Not Web celebs or obscure German-food bloggers.

459
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,560
<18-3,RYAN>这个名单得加上艺术家了
<18-3,RYAN>Well, you better add artists to that list, as well.

460
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,270
<18-3,RYAN>托瑞又确认了一副图片
<18-3,RYAN>Tory just I.D.'d another one of the images.

461
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:33,390
<18-4,CASTLE>是Snappamatic上的吗
<18-4,CASTLE>Is it from Snappamatic?

462
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:36,440
<18-5,RYAN>是的  是一个叫丹尼尔·里克的画家
<18-5,RYAN>Yeah, from the feed of a painter named Daniel Leek.

463
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:39,250
<18-5,RYAN>是从他照的一副画上取的
<18-5,RYAN>The image is from a photo he took of one of his pieces.

464
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,330
<18-5,RYAN>看  这个有效期
<18-5,RYAN>See, the, expiration date

465
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:43,850
<18-5,RYAN>是在这个奶盒上顶部的
<18-5,RYAN>is cropped from the top of this milk carton.

466
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:47,090
<18-5,RYAN>不过里克很少在Snappamatic上发图片
<18-5,RYAN>But Leek's pretty low on the Snappamatic totem pole.

467
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:49,070
<18-5,RYAN>他只有大约2000个粉丝

00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,110
<22-3,CASTLE>事情还没完
<22-3,CASTLE>I'm not done."

579
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:15,160
<22-4,BECKETT>从一开始他就在监视我们
<22-4,BECKETT>He's been watching us from the beginning.

580
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:17,880
<22-4,BECKETT>自始至终他都先我们一步
<22-4,BECKETT>This guy has been ahead of us the whole time.

581
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,990
<22-5,GATES>贝克特警探  说句话方便吗
<22-5,GATES>Detective Beckett, a word?

582
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:30,250
<23-1,GATES>纽约警察总局也看了照片  他们找到我
<23-1,GATES>1pp saw that picture, too, and they called me,

583
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,890
<23-1,GATES>他们担心你在此次案件中的表现
<23-1,GATES>concerned about your commitment to this case.

584
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:34,910
<23-2,BECKTT>长官  他们看到的太片面了
<23-2,BECKTT>Sir, they're taking that photo out of context.

585
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:36,540
<23-3,GATES>事实如何并不重要  凯特
<23-3,GATES>The truth doesn't matter, Kate.

586
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,640
<23-3,GATES>现在这已经是公关的问题了
<23-3,GATES>It's a public-relations problem now.

587
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,640
<23-3,GATES>凶手已经把你变成了
<23-3,GATES>The killer just turned you into the poster child

588
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,290
<23-3,GATES>这些谋杀案未能解决的负面形象
<23-3,GATES>for these murders not being solved.

589
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:43,410
<23-4,BECKETT>所以呢
<23-4,BECKETT>So...what?

590
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:44,620
<23-4,BECKETT>他们要把我撤出这个案子吗
<23-4,BECKETT>They want to take me off the case?

591
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:45,960
<23-5,GATES>我跟他们说不能
<23-5,GATES>I told them no.

592
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:49,370
<23-5,GATES>我不会让嫌疑犯通过控制舆论
<23-5,GATES>I won't let our suspect sabotage this investigation

593
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:51,290
<23-5,GATES>妨碍此次调查
<23-5,GATES>by manipulating the narrative.

594
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:55,350
<23-5,GATES>所以  回家吧  理清思路
<23-5,GATES>So, go home, clear your head.

595
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:58,350
<23-5,GATES>回到这里把他拿下
<23-5,GATES>You get back here and you take his ass down.

596
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:07,590
<24-1,BECKETT>这就是为什么我痛恨社交媒体
<24-1,BECKETT>This is why I hate social media.

597
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:10,230
<24-1,BECKETT>一旦发生些什么  事情就无法控制
<24-1,BECKETT>Once something is out there, you have no control.

598
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,700
<24-1,BECKETT>人们可以随意的将一些私人的瞬间
<24-1,BECKETT>People can take a private moment

599
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,050
<24-1,BECKETT>编造出事情的来龙去脉
<24-1,BECKETT>and create their own context.

600
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:15,420
<24-1,BECKETT>我是说  我们那时根本还没开始调查
<24-1,BECKETT>I mean, we weren't even investigating the murder yet,

601
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,180
<24-1,BECKETT>他们让我们看上去就像坏警察一样
<24-1,BECKETT>and they made us look like we were bad cops.

602
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:18,930
<24-1,BECKETT>更糟糕的是  好像我们不在乎
<24-1,BECKETT>Or worse, like we didn't care.

603
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:20,210
<24-2,CASTLE>没事的  贝克特
<24-2,CASTLE>Come on, Beckett.

604
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:21,330
<24-2,CASTLE>网络就是这样
<24-2,CASTLE>It's the Internet.

605
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:23,110
<24-2,CASTLE>没人会拿那张照片当真
<24-2,CASTLE>No one's gonna take that picture seriously.

606
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,090
<24-3,BECKETT>纽约警察总局就当真了
<24-3,BECKETT>1pp did.

607
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:26,540
<24-4,CASTLE>听着  事情很快就会平息的  好吗
<24-4,CASTLE>Look, it's gonna blow over, okay?

608
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,950
<24-4,CASTLE>每分钟都有无数的信息发布出来
<24-4,CASTLE>With millions of items being posted every minute,

609
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:31,770
<24-4,CASTLE>这只是网络连续体当中的一个小点
<24-4,CASTLE>this is but a blip on the net continuum.

610
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:36,350
<24-5,BECKETT>你知道匿名的问题在哪吗
<24-5,BECKETT>You know the problem with anonymity?

611
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:38,060
<24-5,BECKETT>毫无责任可言
<24-5,BECKETT>There is no accountability.

612
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:41,120
<24-5,BECKETT>这允许了那些胆小怕事的人成为恶霸
<24-5,BECKETT>It empowers cowards to become bullies,

613
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,200
<24-5,BECKETT>就像这家伙一样
<24-5,BECKETT>just like this guy.

614
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,070
<24-5,BECKETT>你知道吗
<24-5,BECKETT>You know what?

615
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:49,300
<24-6,CASTLE>大多数恃强凌弱的人最开始自己是受害者
<24-6,CASTLE>Most bullies started out as victims themselves.

616
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,310
<24-6,CASTLE>也许这人现在在网络上肆意攻击
<24-6,CASTLE>Maybe this guy's lashing out on the Internet

617
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:53,010
<24-6,CASTLE>是因为他之前受到过这样的凌辱
<24-6,CASTLE>because it was used against him.

618
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:54,590
<24-7,BECKETT>他曾经是网络犯罪的受害者
<24-7,BECKETT>He was a victim of cyber crime.

619
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:56,720
<24-8,CASTLE>比尔·加瑞特曾是网络警察
<24-8,CASTLE>And Bill Garrett was a cyber cop.

620
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,170
<24-8,CASTLE>凶手陷害他绝对不是巧合
<24-8,CASTLE>It can't be a coincidence that the killer targeted him.

621
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:01,200
<24-8,CASTLE>我们一直在找加瑞特抓起来的那些人
<24-8,CASTLE>We've been looking at people Garrett put away...

622
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:04,200
<24-9,BECKETT>我们应该去查一查那些案子里的受害者
<24-9,BECKETT>When we should have been looking at victims of his cyber cases.

623
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,210
<24-9,BECKETT>好的  我会联系加瑞特
<24-9,BECKETT>Okay, I'll get a hold of Garrett.

624
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:07,180
<24-9,BECKETT>我会让他查一下旧档案
<24-9,BECKETT>I'll have him look into his old case files.

625
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,630
<24-9,BECKETT>凶手肯定就在其中的某个地方
<24-9,BECKETT>Our killer's got to be in there somewhere.

626
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:10,240
<24-10,CASTLE>但是他到底是怎么潜入加瑞特的商店
<24-10,CASTLE>Still, how did he get into Garrett's shop

627
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,190
<24-10,CASTLE>来伪造证据  还有怎么进到凯姆的车里
<24-10,CASTLE>to plant the evidence, or Cam's car?

628
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:15,570
<25-1,RYAN>我来告诉你怎么做到的  用一把钥匙
<25-1,RYAN>I'll tell you how -- with a key.

629
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:17,520
<25-1,RYAN>一把他做的钥匙
<25-1,RYAN>A key that he made.

630
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,310
<25-2,CASTLE>3D打印机
<25-2,CASTLE>3-D printer.

631
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,630
<25-3,RYAN>还记得我们在凯姆劳斯莱斯的
<25-3,RYAN>Remember the fragments that we found

632
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:22,670
<25-3,RYAN>锁孔里发现的碎屑么
<25-3,RYAN>in the lock of Cam's Rolls-Royce?

633
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:23,860
<25-3,RYAN>成分是聚乳酸
<25-3,RYAN>Well, they're PLA --

634
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:26,810
<25-3,RYAN>是一种用于3D打印的生物塑料
<25-3,RYAN>It's a bioplastic used in 3D printing.

635
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:30,070
<25-3,RYAN>鉴证组在艾比公寓的钥匙孔里
<25-3,RYAN>CSU found PLA in the locks at Abby's apartment,

636
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:31,300
<25-3,RYAN>和加瑞特店里的锁孔也发现了聚乳酸
<25-3,RYAN>as well as Garrett's shop.

637
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:34,170
<25-4,BECKETT>凶手没有原件是怎么把钥匙配出来的
<25-4,BECKETT>How could the killer make a copy of the key without the original?

638
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:36,070
<25-5,RYAN>配钥匙只要一张照片就够了
<25-5,RYAN>Turns out, all you need is a picture.

639
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:38,500
<25-5,RYAN>凯姆刚买到劳斯莱斯的时候
<25-5,RYAN>When Cam bought the Rolls,

640
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:42,060
<25-5,RYAN>他在网上晒照片炫耀来着
<25-5,RYAN>he bragged about it by posting a photo of the key

641
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,680
<25-5,RYAN>任何人都可以由此将钥匙模型数字化
<25-5,RYAN>that anyone could then digitize.

642
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:46,490
<25-5,RYAN>正如凶手所为
<25-5,RYAN>So, just as the killer did,

643
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:51,750
<25-5,RYAN>我把钥匙模型上传给打印机
<25-5,RYAN>I uploaded the photo to the printer and...

644
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:54,620
<25-5,RYAN>瞧瞧看
<25-5,RYAN>...voila!

645
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:55,930
<25-6,CASTLE>真厉害
<25-6,CASTLE>Outstanding.

646
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:58,680
<25-7,BECKETT>与其说"真厉害"不如说"真可怕"
<25-7,BECKETT>If by "Outstanding" you mean "Horrifying."

647
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:01,040
<25-7,BECKETT>凶手拍了一张钥匙的照片
<25-7,BECKETT>The killer snapped a photo of this key

648
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,090
<25-7,BECKETT>然后用3D打印配了一把出来
<25-7,BECKETT>and then made a 3D duplicate of it.

649
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:04,480
<25-8,RYAN>欢迎来到未来
<25-8,RYAN>Welcome to the future.

650
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,110
<25-9,CASTLE>我还是想弄一台这机器
<25-9,CASTLE>Still, I got to get one of these.

651
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:11,010
<25-10,BECKETT>有什么办法能知道凶手是哪里买的打印机
<25-10,BECKETT>Is there any way of finding out where the killer got his?

652
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:11,640
<25-11,RYAN>我们正在查
<25-11,RYAN>Well, we're checking.

653
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,510
<25-11,RYAN>不过除了实体店还有网上卖家
<25-11,RYAN>But between brick-and-mortar and online stores,

654
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:14,770
<25-11,RYAN>有上百个要查
<25-11,RYAN>we got hundreds of vendors.

655
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,330
<25-12,BECKETT>这倒是解释了他怎么弄到凯姆的钥匙的
<25-12,BECKETT>Well, this explains how he got Cam's key,

656
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:18,960
<25-12,BECKETT>却没法说明加瑞特和艾比的情况
<25-12,BECKETT>but not Garrett and Abby's.

657
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,120
<26-1,CARLOS>艾比从来没传过有她钥匙的照片
<26-1,CARLOS>Uh, Abby never posted photos of her keys.

658
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,480
<26-1,CARLOS>她也很小心  从来不把钥匙随处乱丢
<26-1,CARLOS>And she was careful. It's not like she left them lying around.

659
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,850
<26-2,ESPOSITO>她有没有让人代停车过
<26-2,ESPOSITO>Did she ever valet park her car?

660
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:28,150
<26-3,CARLOS>没有  除了要出城她都很少开车的
<26-3,CARLOS>No, she didn't even drive it except to get out of the city.

661
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,050
<26-4,ESPOSITO>她的朋友里会有她家钥匙的吗
<26-4,ESPOSITO>Any of her friends have keys to her place?

662
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:30,830
<26-5,CARLOS>没有
<26-5,CARLOS>No.

663
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:32,120
<26-6,ESPOSITO>她就从来没让人在她家借宿过
<26-6,ESPOSITO>She never let anybody crash there?

664
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:34,710
<26-6,ESPOSITO>等等...
<26-6,ESPOSITO>Actually...

665
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:37,780
<26-7,CARLOS>艾比曾在旅游网站上出租过她的公寓
<26-7,CARLOS>Abby used to rent out her apartment online through a travel site.

666
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,700
<26-8,ESPOSITO>那些租客们  又是怎么拿到钥匙的
<26-8,ESPOSITO>The people who stayed -- how'd they get her keys?

667
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,880
<26-9,CARLOS>她就把钥匙放在门廊前的一块砖头下面
<26-9,CARLOS>She'd leave them under a loose brick on her stoop.

668
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:44,700
<27-1,ESPOSITO>我一直在查那些租过艾比公寓的人
<27-1,ESPOSITO>So, I've been running the people that rented Abby's apartment.

669
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:48,270
<27-2,BECKETT>为什么会有人让陌生人住他们家
<27-2,BECKETT>Why would anyone let complete strangers stay in their place?

670
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,210
<27-3,TORY>赚点外快
<27-3,TORY>Extra money.

671
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:53,290
<27-3,TORY>这事之后  我想我是不会再这么干了
<27-3,TORY>After this, I don't think I'll be doing it anymore.

672
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:55,390
<27-4,ESPOSITO>大部分租客都没问题
<27-4,ESPOSITO>So, all the renters checked out,

673
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:58,460
<27-4,ESPOSITO>除了有一位  预订之后就没有出现过
<27-4,ESPOSITO>except for one guy who booked and never showed up.

674
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:00,990
<27-5,TORY>这是来自艾比公寓对面的自动取款机
<27-5,TORY>This is from an ATM across from Abby's apartment

675
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:03,000
<27-5,TORY>就在那人本该入住的那天
<27-5,TORY>on the day he was supposed to stay there.

676
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,030
<27-6,ESPOSITO>那人其实来过  仔细看
<27-6,ESPOSITO>Turns out a guy did show up. Check this out.

677
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:14,200
<27-7,CASTLE>他给钥匙拍了张照片
<27-7,CASTLE>He took a picture of her key.

678
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,440
<27-7,CASTLE>他就是网络杀手  肯定是
<27-7,CASTLE>It's the net slayer. It's got to be.

679
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,540
<27-8,TORY>拍摄距离太远像素过低我没法放大
<27-8,TORY>It's too far away and too low-res to blow up,

680
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:20,280
<27-8,TORY>但仔细看  等他走过
<27-8,TORY>but watch this as he walks away.

681
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:22,650
<27-9,TORY>就这儿
<27-9,TORY>There.

682
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,280
<27-10,BECKETT>这下可以看清脸了
<27-10,BECKETT>And now we have a face.

683
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:36,320
<28-1,GATES>这人的身份调查进行得怎么样了
<28-1,GATES>Okay. Where are we on finding this man?

684
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,430
<28-2,ESPOSITO>我们正在分发他的照片
<28-2,ESPOSITO>We're distributing his picture.

685
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:38,970
<28-2,ESPOSITO>目前为止  尚未有受害人的家属
<28-2,ESPOSITO>So far, none of the victims' families

686
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:40,230
<28-2,ESPOSITO>或者邻居认出他来
<28-2,ESPOSITO>or neighbors recognize him.

687
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:42,130
<28-3,BECKETT>长官  我想把他的照片公布到媒体
<28-3,BECKETT>Sir, I'd like to release his photo to the press

688
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:43,090
<28-3,BECKETT>和社交网站
<28-3,BECKETT>and social media.

689
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,180
<28-3,BECKETT>这样我们就能转被动为主动
<28-3,BECKETT>Let's turn the tables on this guy.

690
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:46,050
<28-3,BECKETT>他一直在藏着
<28-3,BECKETT>He's trying to hide it,

691
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:48,530
<28-3,BECKETT>肯定有人能认出他来
<28-3,BECKETT>but someone out there's gonna recognize his face.

692
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,160
<28-4,GARRETT>你说的没错  那个人就是我
<28-4,GARRETT>You're right, and that someone is me.

693
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:54,050
<28-4,GARRETT>这位警官给我看他照片的时候
<28-4,GARRETT>I was going over his case files

694
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:55,750
<28-4,GARRETT>我正好在查看他的案件资料
<28-4,GARRETT>when the officer showed me his photo.

695
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:56,760
<28-5,BECKETT>他是谁
<28-5,BECKETT>Who is he?

696
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:57,950
<28-6,GARRETT>他叫安当·连恩
<28-6,GARRETT>His name's Adam Lane.

697
00:26:58,910 --> 00:26:59,980
<28-7,GATES>你曾逮捕过他
<28-7,GATES>You arrested him?

698
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,100
<28-8,GARRETT>我认识他的时候他可不是罪犯
<28-8,GARRETT>He wasn't a criminal when we met.

699
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:01,890
<28-8,GARRETT>他是受害者
<28-8,GARRETT>He was a victim.

700
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:04,940
<28-9,CASTLE>那你知道他现在在哪里吗
<28-9,CASTLE>And do you have any idea where he is now?

701
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:07,150
<28-10,GARRETT>我已经有六年没有听到过他的消息了
<28-10,GARRETT>I haven't seen or heard from Lane in six years.

702
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:08,620
<28-10,GARRETT>他戴着的假胡子
<28-10,GARRETT>Took me a minute to recognize him

703
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:10,230
<28-10,GARRETT>让我花了好一会儿才认出他来
<28-10,GARRETT>with that fake beard he's wearing.

704
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:11,520
<28-10,GARRETT>好的
<28-10,GARRETT>Okay.

705
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,640
<28-11,GATES>我去准备把安当·连恩的姓名
<28-11,GATES>I'll get ready to release Adam Lane's name

706
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,100
<28-11,GATES>和照片发布给媒体
<28-11,GATES>and picture to the media.

707
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:17,250
<28-12,ESPOSITO>找不到连恩的当前住址
<28-12,ESPOSITO>There's no current address for Lane.

708
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:17,860
<28-13,BECKETT>继续找
<28-13,BECKETT>Try to find one.

709
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,870
<28-13,BECKETT>联系他的家人和任何可能认识他的人
<28-13,BECKETT>Reach out to his family and anyone else that knows him.

710
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:20,390
<28-13,BECKETT>与此同时
<28-13,BECKETT>In the meantime,

711
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:22,740
<28-13,BECKETT>你得把你知道任何有关安当·连恩的信息告诉我们
<28-13,BECKETT>you need to tell us everything you know about Adam Lane.

712
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:28,190
<29-1,GARRETT>当时连恩还是个高中生
<29-1,GARRETT>Lane was in high school back then.

713
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:30,240
<29-1,GARRETT>那是个网络欺凌案件
<29-1,GARRETT>It was a cyber-bullying case.

714
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,590
<29-2,BECKETT>是谁欺负他的
<29-2,BECKETT>Who was bullying him?

715
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:33,970
<29-3,GARRETT>他当时正在洗澡  一个叫蒂姆·威瑟斯彭的
<29-3,GARRETT>He was taking a shower when this meathead football player,

716
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:35,790
<29-3,GARRETT>白痴橄榄球运动员偷了他的衣服
<29-3,GARRETT>Tim Witherspoon, stole his clothes.

717
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:37,670
<29-3,GARRETT>类似的事情以前一直发生在连恩的身上
<29-3,GARRETT>Now, this has happened to Lane his whole life,

718
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,520
<29-3,GARRETT>不过这次  他被惹毛了
<29-3,GARRETT>but this time, he went ballistic.

719
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:40,940
<29-3,GARRETT>他就这样  一丝不挂
<29-3,GARRETT>There he was, buck naked,

720
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,540
<29-3,GARRETT>在更衣室里冲着威瑟斯彭大喊大叫
<29-3,GARRETT>screaming at Witherspoon in a locker room.

721
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:44,330
<29-4,CASTLE>我猜马上就是网络欺凌的部分了
<29-4,CASTLE>I think I know where the cyber part comes in.

722
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:46,180
<29-5,GARRETT>没错  威瑟斯彭偷偷录像了
<29-5,GARRETT>Yeah, Witherspoon secretly recorded it

723
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:48,000
<29-5,GARRETT>还把视频放到他的Myspace页面
<29-5,GARRETT>and posted it on his Myspace page.

724
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,760
<29-6,BECKETT>这回他被公开羞辱了
<29-6,BECKETT>So he was publicly humiliated.

725
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:51,730
<29-7,GARRETT>是的  不过不仅仅是羞辱
<29-7,GARRETT>Yeah, but it wasn't just humiliation.

726
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,800
<29-7,GARRETT>视频公开之后  所有的人都嘲笑他
<29-7,GARRETT>After the video, the kids turned on him.

727
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:57,330
<29-7,GARRETT>他的邮箱里堆满了他们发来的恶意邮件
<29-7,GARRETT>They inundated him with these awful, hateful e-mails,

728
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:59,610
<29-7,GARRETT>根本没有人被追究责任
<29-7,GARRETT>and no one was held accountable.

729
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:00,500
<29-8,BECKETT>为什么没有
<29-8,BECKETT>Why not?

730
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,610
<29-9,GARRETT>当时的网络欺凌法案还没健全
<29-9,GARRETT>The cyber-bullying laws at the time were weak.

731
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:03,870
<29-9,GARRETT>我让他们把视频撤下来了
<29-9,GARRETT>I got them to take the video down,

732
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:06,160
<29-9,GARRETT>但我没法说服检察官起诉他们
<29-9,GARRETT>but I couldn't convince the D.A. to press charges.

733
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,400
<29-9,GARRETT>我应该逼得更紧一些
<29-9,GARRETT>I should've tried harder.

734
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,530
<29-10,CASTLE>连恩后来怎样了
<29-10,CASTLE>What happened to Lane?

735
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:12,410
<29-11,GARRETT>每个人都会有崩溃的时候  对吧
<29-11,GARRETT>Everyone has their breaking point, right?

736
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:14,280
<29-11,GARRETT>退学  远离公众视野
<29-11,GARRETT>Quit school, withdrew from life.

737
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,610
<29-11,GARRETT>这件事毁了他
<29-11,GARRETT>It ruined him.

738
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,230
<29-12,CASTLE>他现在要通过追杀媒体上
<29-12,CASTLE>And now he's getting revenge

739
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:19,500
<29-12,CASTLE>有名气的孩子借以实施报复
<29-12,CASTLE>by going after the popular kids on social media.

740
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,460
<29-13,GARRETT>把我作为目标是因为我没有保护他
<29-13,GARRETT>And targeting me because I didn't protect him.

741
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:23,040
<29-14,BECKETT>不只是你  我们都是
<29-14,BECKETT>Not just you -- all of us.

742
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:27,720
<29-14,BECKETT>他有什么朋友吗
<29-14,BECKETT>Did he have any friends?

743
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:29,420
<29-14,BECKETT>有没有什么他喜欢去的地方
<29-14,BECKETT>Was there anywhere he liked to hang out?

744
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,950
<29-15,GARRETT>没有  他是个独来独往的电脑极客
<29-15,GARRETT>Nah, he was a loner. Computer geek.

745
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,730
<29-15,GARRETT>他几乎没什么朋友
<29-15,GARRETT>He didn't have any friends.

746
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:35,750
<29-15,GARRETT>我就只知道这些了
<29-15,GARRETT>That's pretty much all I know.

747
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:40,780
<30-1,RYAN>没追踪到安当·连恩
<30-1,RYAN>Having no luck tracking down Adam Lane.

748
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:42,130
<30-1,RYAN>就好像他人间蒸发了一样
<30-1,RYAN>It's like he went off the grid.

749
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:46,960
<30-1,RYAN>没有纳税申报单  没有驾照  没有工作
<30-1,RYAN>No tax returns, no driver's license, no job,

750
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,160
<30-1,RYAN>除了三年前在殡仪馆工作过
<30-1,RYAN>except for a stint at a funeral home three years ago.

751
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,760
<30-2,BECKETT>他一定是那时学会解剖的
<30-2,BECKETT>That must be how he knows about anatomy.

752
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,810
<30-2,BECKETT>他的父母呢
<30-2,BECKETT>What about his parents?

753
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:52,720
<30-3,RYAN>父亲一直不在身边
<30-3,RYAN>Uh, father wasn't in the picture.

754
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,040
<30-3,RYAN>母亲一年前去世了
<30-3,RYAN>Mother died about a year ago.

755
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:55,990
<30-4,ESPOSITO>听这个
<30-4,ESPOSITO>Hey, get this --

756
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:59,130
<30-4,ESPOSITO>我查到了蒂姆·威瑟斯彭  欺负连恩的那个人
<30-4,ESPOSITO>I ran down Tim Witherspoon, Lane's bully.

757
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:00,770
<30-4,ESPOSITO>原来他已经死了
<30-4,ESPOSITO>turns out he's dead.

758
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:02,230
<30-4,ESPOSITO>至今未破的谋杀案
<30-4,ESPOSITO>Unsolved homicide.

759
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:04,130
<30-4,ESPOSITO>十个月前他被刺死在自己的公寓里
<30-4,ESPOSITO>He was stabbed in his apartment 10 months ago.

760
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:06,180
<30-5,CASTLE>那正好也是连恩母亲死的时候
<30-5,CASTLE>That's right after Lane's mother died.

761
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,240
<30-5,CASTLE>也许这件事激发了他的复仇欲望
<30-5,CASTLE>Maybe that's what triggered him.

762
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,570
<30-6,BECKETT>所以他杀了威瑟斯彭  为自己报了仇
<30-6,BECKETT>So, he murdered Witherspoon, took his revenge,

763
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:11,130
<30-6,BECKETT>但这还不能满足他
<30-6,BECKETT>but that wasn't enough for him.

764
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,170
<30-6,BECKETT>连恩和他母亲住在哪里
<30-6,BECKETT>Where did Lane and his mom live?

765
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:14,700
<30-7,RYAN>她死后  他卖掉了公寓
<30-7,RYAN>Well, the apartment sold when she died,

766
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:17,620
<30-7,RYAN>他们以前住在东部第五大道
<30-7,RYAN>but they lived on avenue at east 5th.

767
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:18,770
<30-8,ESPOSITO>那是下东区
<30-8,ESPOSITO>That's the lower east side.

768
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:20,530
<30-8,ESPOSITO>自从我们放出连恩的照片
<30-8,ESPOSITO>Ever since we released Lane's photo,

769
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:22,740
<30-8,ESPOSITO>收到很多线报说他在那附近出现
<30-8,ESPOSITO>we've had multiple tips that he'd been seen in that area.

770
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:25,230
<30-9,CASTLE>像连恩这样的反社会青年无法融入社会
<30-9,CASTLE>Anti-social kid like Lane who's never made his way in the world

771
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:27,120
<30-9,CASTLE>他一定还会待在自己熟悉的地方
<30-9,CASTLE>is gonna stay with what's familiar.

772
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:29,170
<30-9,CASTLE>下东区是他唯一熟悉的地方
<30-9,CASTLE>Lower east side's the only neighborhood he's ever known.

773
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:30,480
<30-10,BECKETT>谁买下了他母亲的房子
<30-10,BECKETT>Who bought his mother's place?

774
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,520
<30-11,RYAN>一对年老的俄罗斯夫妇
<30-11,RYAN>Uh... old Russian couple.

775
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:34,980
<30-11,RYAN>但地下室被租出去了
<30-11,RYAN>But the basement is a rental unit.

776
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,870
<30-12,CASTLE>谁想赌一下连恩依旧住在那里
<30-12,CASTLE>Who wants to bet Lane's still living there?

777
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,350
<31-1,BECKETT>安当·连恩  你因谋杀罪被捕
<31-1,BECKETT>Adam Lane, you're under arrest for murder.

778
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,350
<31-2,CASTLE>你笑什么
<31-2,CASTLE>What's so funny?

779
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:02,720
<31-3,ADAM LANE>你会知道的
<31-3,ADAM LANE>You'll see.

781

<31-5,ESPOSITO>-出问题了  -什么问题
<31-5,ESPOSITO>- We got a problem. - What's the problem?

782
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:14,920
<31-6,BECKETT>我们已经扣押安当·连恩了
<31-6,BECKETT>We got Adam Lane in custody.

783
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,490
<31-7,ESPOSITO>他也扣押别人了
<31-7,ESPOSITO>Well, he's got people in custody, too.

784

<31-10,ESPOSITO>They're about to be his next victims.

<32-1,CASTLE>"Like me or I die."

790
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:44,740
<32-1,CASTLE>全凭人气投票
<32-1,CASTLE>It's a popularity contest.

791
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:46,380
<32-2,ESPOSITO>肯特要输了
<32-2,ESPOSITO>And Kent is losing.

794
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,180
<32-3,RYAN>他们都被连接上电引线
<32-3,RYAN>They're both attached to electrical leads.

795
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,430
<32-4,ESPOSITO>那端的电源
<32-4,ESPOSITO>Which probably lead to a power supply

796
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:54,720
<32-4,ESPOSITO>应该是被电脑所控制
<32-4,ESPOSITO>controlled by a computer.

797
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,500
<32-5,RYAN>倒数计时是一小时
<32-5,RYAN>That countdown started at one hour.

798
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:57,610
<32-5,RYAN>一旦时间归零

801
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:01,900
<32-7,BECKETT>或者都会死
<32-7,BECKETT>Or they both do.

802
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,290
<32-8,CASTLE>这是对社交媒体的终极进攻
<32-8,CASTLE>It's the ultimate attack on social media.

803
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:06,210
<32-9,RYAN>还有我们
<32-9,RYAN>And us.

804
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,280
<32-9,RYAN>他们想让我们无能为力
<32-9,RYAN>He wants us to feel powerless.

805
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:11,190
<32-9,RYAN>尽管他已经被收押  可他们依然会死
<32-9,RYAN>Those guys are gonna die even though he's in custody.

806
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:12,690
<32-10,BECKETT>如果我们先找到他们就不会死
<32-10,BECKETT>Not if we get to them first.

807
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,070
<32-11,ESPOSITO>在37分钟内吗
<32-11,ESPOSITO>In 37 minutes?

808
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,290
<32-11,ESPOSITO>怎么才能做到
<32-11,ESPOSITO>How are we gonna do that?

809
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:16,640
<32-11,ESPOSITO>他们都在油布前面
<32-11,ESPOSITO>They're in front of tarps.

810
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,400
<32-11,ESPOSITO>没有背景可供追查
<32-11,ESPOSITO>There's no background detail.

811
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,520
<32-11,ESPOSITO>他们可能在任何地方
<32-11,ESPOSITO>These guys could be anywhere.

812
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,520
<32-11,ESPOSITO>很可能是在两个不同的地方
<32-11,ESPOSITO>Maybe even in separate places.

813
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,920
<32-12,BECKETT>去Snappamatic办公室
<32-12,BECKETT>Go to the Snappamatic offices.

814
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,130
<32-12,BECKETT>也许他们能帮我们追踪到照片的来源
<32-12,BECKETT>Maybe they'll help us track down the source of these photos

815
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:28,230
<32-12,BECKETT>现在肯特和奥伦命悬一线
<32-12,BECKETT>now that Kent and Oren's lives are at stake.

816
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:30,590
<32-13,CASTLE>你准备怎么做
<32-13,CASTLE>What are you gonna do?

817
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,860
<32-14,BECKETT>我要让安当·连恩开口
<32-14,BECKETT>I'm gonna make Adam Lane talk.

818
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:49,060
<33-1,ADAM>谁的票数高  奥伦还是肯特
<33-1,ADAM>So, who's ahead, Oren or Kent?

819
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,920
<33-2,BECKETT>不仅是他们没有时间了  亚当
<33-2,BECKETT>Time isn't just running out for them, Adam.

820
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,380
<33-2,BECKETT>你也一样
<33-2,BECKETT>It's running out for you, as well.

821
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:57,300
<33-2,BECKETT>你就要失去
<33-2,BECKETT>Your one and only window of opportunity

822
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,570
<33-2,BECKETT>仅存的供认机会了
<33-2,BECKETT>is about to close.

823
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,200
<33-3,ADAM>无可奉告
<33-3,ADAM>Got nothing to say.

824
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,500
<33-4,BECKETT>我跟你说实话
<33-4,BECKETT>Look, I'm not gonna lie to you.

825
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,720
<33-4,BECKETT>你会进监狱的
<33-4,BECKETT>You are going to prison.

826
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,870
<33-4,BECKETT>但如果你告诉我们肯特和奥伦在哪里
<33-4,BECKETT>But if you tell me where Kent and Oren are,

827
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:09,800
<33-4,BECKETT>你还依然可以选择什么样的监狱
<33-4,BECKETT>then you can still control what kind of prison.

828
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:12,700
<33-5,ADAM>那句话怎么说来着
<33-5,ADAM>What's the expression?

829
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,300
<33-5,ADAM>三顿热饭一张小床
<33-5,ADAM>Three hots and a cot?

830
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:16,430
<33-5,ADAM>我可以接受
<33-5,ADAM>Works for me.

831
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:19,370
<33-6,BECKETT>如果你被送到重刑狱间
<33-6,BECKETT>Yeah, well, you're not gonna be saying that

832
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:21,500
<33-6,BECKETT>就不会这样说了
<33-6,BECKETT>if you get sent to the supermax unit,

833
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:25,440
<33-6,BECKETT>那里关押的都是最危险最暴力的犯人
<33-6,BECKETT>where we put our most dangerous and violent inmates.

834
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:29,650
<33-6,BECKETT>你的余生都会在那里渡过
<33-6,BECKETT>You'll be on lockdown there 24/7 for the rest of your life.

835
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,760
<33-7,ADAM>不会比高中更惨的
<33-7,ADAM>Can't be any worse than high school.

836
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:33,430
<33-7,ADAM>是吗
<33-7,ADAM>Really?

837
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,890
<33-8,BECKETT>你以为那时候你被欺负了吗
<33-8,BECKETT>And you think that you were bullied?

838
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:40,210
<33-8,BECKETT>在监狱里所遭受的待遇
<33-8,BECKETT>Well, prison is going to take you places

839
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:42,290
<33-8,BECKETT>是你现在无法想象的
<33-8,BECKETT>that you can't imagine.

840
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:47,140
<33-8,BECKETT>像你这样的年轻又听话的小伙
<33-8,BECKETT>Guy like you, young, teachable.

841
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:48,570
<33-9,ADAM>没关系
<33-9,ADAM>Doesn't matter.

842
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,280
<33-9,ADAM>我已经得到我想要的了
<33-9,ADAM>I already have what I want.

843
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:52,230
<33-10,BECKETT>你认为你得到什么了
<33-10,BECKETT>And what do you think you have?

844
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,350
<33-11,ADAM>千古留名
<33-11,ADAM>A legacy.

845
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:57,300
<33-11,ADAM>互联网是永存的
<33-11,ADAM>The internet is permanent.

846
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,780
<33-11,ADAM>网络杀手将永垂不朽
<33-11,ADAM>The net slayer will live forever.

847
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:02,170
<33-11,ADAM>人们提起我就像是提起
<33-11,ADAM>I'll be mentioned in the same breath

848
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:03,820
<33-11,ADAM>曼森和十二宫杀手一样[均为变态连环杀手]
<33-11,ADAM>as Manson and the Zodiac.

849
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:04,610
<33-11,ADAM>而且
<33-11,ADAM>And...

850
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:09,000
<33-11,ADAM>如果我在被拘留期间
<33-11,ADAM>if I commit a murder while in police custody,

851
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,190
<33-11,ADAM>坐在你眼前
<33-11,ADAM>while looking you in the eye,

852
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:14,350
<33-11,ADAM>还杀了个人  那我就比他们还厉害
<33-11,ADAM>I could argue I did them one better.

853
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:17,800
<33-11,ADAM>你们无法阻止我
<33-11,ADAM>There's nothing you can do to stop me.

854
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:21,180
<33-12,BECKETT>安当  你需要帮助
<33-12,BECKETT>Adam, you need help.

855
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:22,930
<33-12,BECKETT>你这是种病态
<33-12,BECKETT>You're sick.

856
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:25,070
<33-12,BECKETT>-让我帮你  -我是病态
<33-12,BECKETT>- Let me get you - I'm sick?

857
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:30,510
<33-13,ADAM>我又没逼任何人关注我
<33-13,ADAM>Nobody had to follow me.

858
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:33,680
<33-13,ADAM>也没逼任何人给肯特或者奥伦投票
<33-13,ADAM>No one has to vote for Kent or Oren.

859
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:35,330
<33-13,ADAM>但是他们不能自已
<33-13,ADAM>But they can't help themselves.

860
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:36,780
<33-13,ADAM>他们想参与其中
<33-13,ADAM>They -- they want to be a part of it.

861
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:41,110
<33-13,ADAM>他们非看不可  所以病态的到底是谁
<33-13,ADAM>They have to watch. So...who is really sick?

862
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,560
<34-1,GARRETT>他不是一直这样的
<34-1,GARRETT>He wasn't always like that.

863
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:48,050
<34-1,GARRETT>如果我可以回到过去重新来过的话
<34-1,GARRETT>If I could go back and do it over again...

864
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:49,430
<34-2,CASTLE>他变成这样不是你的错
<34-2,CASTLE>You didn't make him this way.

865
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:51,310
<34-3,GARRETT>可我也没能阻止事态的发展
<34-3,GARRETT>Yeah, but I didn't stop it.

866
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,430
<34-3,GARRETT>现在我也无法救那俩人的命
<34-3,GARRETT>And now I can't stop these two guys from dying.

867
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:56,620
<34-4,CASTLE>能让他开口的人非贝克特警探莫属
<34-4,CASTLE>If anyone can break him, it's Detective Beckett.

868
00:33:57,390 --> 00:33:59,570
<34-4,CASTLE>而且Snappamatic或许也能帮到我们
<34-4,CASTLE>And there's still a chance Snappamatic can help us.

869
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:06,050
<35-1,RYAN>进展如何
<35-1,RYAN>How we doing?

870
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,600
<35-1,RYAN>编码又不是按一下钮就行了
<35-1,RYAN>Coding's not like flipping a switch.

871
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,840
<35-2,EVAN>要时间的
<35-2,EVAN>It takes a little while.

872
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,660
<35-3,RYAN>我们没时间了  伊万
<35-3,RYAN>We don't have a while, Evan.

873
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:12,120
<35-3,RYAN>我们还有十五分钟的时间
<35-3,RYAN>We have...15 minutes to find these guys.

874
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:13,720
<35-4,EVAN>我已经尽快了
<35-4,EVAN>I'm going as fast as I can.

875
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:15,380
<35-4,EVAN>肯特在研究一个用来解锁
<35-4,EVAN>Kent was working on a software patch

876
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:17,730
<35-4,EVAN>隐私条款的软件补丁
<35-4,EVAN>that would disable the program's privacy protocols.

877
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:19,000
<35-5,RYAN>如果我们解锁了隐私条款
<35-5,RYAN>And if we disable the protocols,

878
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,400
<35-5,RYAN>就能追踪这些照片的来源了吗
<35-5,RYAN>we can track where these photos are coming from?

879
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,300
<35-5,RYAN>是的
<35-5,RYAN>Yes.

880
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,250
<35-6,EVAN>理论上是的
<35-6,EVAN>I mean, in theory.

881
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:24,170
<35-6,EVAN>问题是  我们从来没试过
<35-6,EVAN>The thing is, we've never done it before.

882
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:25,350
<35-6,EVAN>我不知道会不会成功
<35-6,EVAN>I don't know if it'll work.

883
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,830
<35-7,ESPOSITO>我们没有找到绑架的目击者
<35-7,ESPOSITO>Our canvass didn't turn up a single witness to the abduction.

884
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:33,230
<35-7,ESPOSITO>我们毫无进展
<35-7,ESPOSITO>We're nowhere, bro.

885
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,520
<35-7,ESPOSITO>但愿你这边有进展
<35-7,ESPOSITO>Tell me you got something.

886
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,490
<35-8,RYAN>就快有结果了
<35-8,RYAN>About to find out.

887
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:38,290
<35-9,EVAN>好了  开始吧
<35-9,EVAN>Okay, let's do this.

888
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:46,690
<35-10,RYAN>发生什么事了
<35-10,RYAN>What happened?

889
00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:49,580
<35-11,EVAN>系统崩溃了  我们被锁住了
<35-11,EVAN>System crash. We're locked out.

890
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:51,090
<35-12,ESPOSITO>重启啊
<35-12,ESPOSITO>Well, get it back up.

891
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:52,990
<35-12,ESPOSITO>再过十五分钟这俩人就没命了
<35-12,ESPOSITO>We got 15 minutes before these guys are dead.

892
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,880
<35-13,EVAN>重启要二十分钟
<35-13,EVAN>It takes 20 minutes to reboot.

893
00:34:58,540 --> 00:34:59,310
<36-1,GARRETT>发生什么事了
<36-1,GARRETT>What just happened?

894
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:01,970
<36-2,CASTLE>他们的尝试失败了  网站崩溃了
<36-2,CASTLE>Whatever they were trying didn't go well. The site just crashed.

895
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:04,140
<36-3,GARRETT>我们无法追踪奥伦和肯特的所在地
<36-3,GARRETT>So there's no way to trace those feeds of Oren and Kent

896
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,580
<36-3,GARRETT>而计时器将会继续倒计时
<36-3,GARRETT>and the timer will just keep counting down

897
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:06,720
<36-3,GARRETT>直到他们其中一人死掉为止
<36-3,GARRETT>until one of them is dead?

898
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,510
<36-4,CASTLE>现在一切都指望贝克特了
<36-4,CASTLE>It's all up to Beckett now.

899
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,750
<37-1,BECKETT>安当  只要回答一个问题
<37-1,BECKETT>Adam, just answer one question,

900
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:13,260
<37-1,BECKETT>也许就能救你的命
<37-1,BECKETT>and it might save your life.

901
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:16,830
<37-1,BECKETT>奥伦和肯特在哪
<37-1,BECKETT>Where are Oren and Kent?

902
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:22,320
<37-2,ADAM>如果你们警察有能力的话  早就找到了
<37-2,ADAM>If you cops were capable of doing your jobs, you'd know.

903
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:23,380
<37-2,ADAM>回头看看
<37-2,ADAM>And, looking back,

904
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,800
<37-2,ADAM>也许这一切就都不会发生了
<37-2,ADAM>maybe none of this would have ever happened.

905
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,890
<37-3,BECKETT>我知道在你身上发生的事很残忍
<37-3,BECKETT>Look, a horrible thing was done to you.

906
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,940
<37-3,BECKETT>但是多杀两个人也于事无补呀
<37-3,BECKETT>But how is killing two more people going to fix that?

907
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:34,100
<37-3,BECKETT>这能治愈你吗  不能
<37-3,BECKETT>How is that gonna heal you? It won't.

908
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,120
<37-4,ADAM>可以
<37-4,ADAM>It will.

909
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:39,140
<37-4,ADAM>你难道没看出我已经赢了吗
<37-4,ADAM>Don't you see that I've already won?

910
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:41,060
<37-4,ADAM>这样吧
<37-4,ADAM>I'll tell you what --

911
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:46,060
<37-4,ADAM>承认我赢了  我就给你个提示
<37-4,ADAM>admit that I've won and I'll give you a hint.

912
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,740
<37-4,ADAM>我给你个机会找到肯特或奥伦
<37-4,ADAM>I'll give you a chance to find Kent or Oren before...

913
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:57,520
<37-5,BECKETT>好吧
<37-5,BECKETT>Fine.

914
00:35:58,580 --> 00:35:59,540
<37-5,BECKETT>你赢了
<37-5,BECKETT>You won.

915
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,500
<37-5,BECKETT>给我提示吧
<37-5,BECKETT>Now give me the hint.

916
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:05,920
<37-6,ADAM>我改变主意了
<37-6,ADAM>Changed my mind.

917
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:10,260
<38-1,GARRETT>还剩七分钟
<38-1,GARRETT>Seven minutes left.

918
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:12,030
<38-1,GARRETT>她必须做点什么  逼他开口
<38-1,GARRETT>She's got to make a move, shake him up somehow.

919
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:12,990
<38-2,CASTLE>她会的
<38-2,CASTLE>She will.

920
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:14,940
<38-2,CASTLE>网络杀手
<38-2,CASTLE>Net Slayer.

921
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,140
<38-2,CASTLE>真能引起共鸣啊
<38-2,CASTLE>That's evocative.

922
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:19,720
<39-1,BECKETT>我能理解你为什么会选这么个名字
<39-1,BECKETT>I could -- I could see how you would pick that.

923
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:24,730
<39-1,BECKETT>我能想象到一个身穿黑色连帽衫
<39-1,BECKETT>I picture a-a hooded figure in all black,

924
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:28,190
<39-1,BECKETT>又高又壮的人  没准还拿着个斧子
<39-1,BECKETT>tall, muscular, maybe carrying an ax.

925
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,880
<39-1,BECKETT>但是你知道我想象不到什么吗  安当
<39-1,BECKETT>But you know what I don't picture, Adam?

926
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:33,040
<39-1,BECKETT>任何人都想像不到的东西
<39-1,BECKETT>What nobody pictures?

927
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,730
<39-1,BECKETT>你
<39-1,BECKETT>You.

928
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,120
<39-2,ADAM>你以为你赢了吗
<39-2,ADAM>You think that you won?

929
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:42,180
<39-2,ADAM>你没有  别人都赢了
<39-2,ADAM>You haven't. Everyone else has.

930
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,190
<39-2,ADAM>什么意思  什么叫别人都赢了
<39-2,ADAM>What do you mean, "Everyone else"?

931
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:45,460
<39-3,BECKETT>所有那些欺负过你的人
<39-3,BECKETT>Everyone who ever bullied you,

932
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:48,610
<39-3,BECKETT>伤害过你  轻视过你的人
<39-3,BECKETT>who ever hurt you, belittled you,

933
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:52,890
<39-3,BECKETT>还有那些认为你软弱无能渺小的人
<39-3,BECKETT>Who thought that you were weak and worthless and small.

934
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:54,690
<39-3,BECKETT>你知道吗  安当
<39-3,BECKETT>And you know what, Adam?

935
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:56,320
<39-3,BECKETT>他们是对的
<39-3,BECKETT>They were right.

936
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,210
<39-4,ADAM>不  不是
<39-4,ADAM>No, they weren't.

937
00:36:57,210 --> 00:36:58,630
<39-4,ADAM>我才不是那种人呢
<39-4,ADAM>I am not any of those things.

938
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:00,540
<39-5,BECKETT>你比那还要糟
<39-5,BECKETT>You're all of them and worse.

939
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:02,560
<39-6,ADAM>是他们把我变成现在这样的
<39-6,ADAM>I am what people made me.

940
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:05,420
<39-7,BECKETT>你天生如此  或是你母亲把你造就成这样的
<39-7,BECKETT>You were born this way, or your mommy made you.

941
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:08,440
<39-7,BECKETT>但是蒂姆·威瑟斯彭和学校里其他的孩子
<39-7,BECKETT>But Tim Witherspoon and the rest of the kids at school,

942
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:09,960
<39-7,BECKETT>他们并没有毁了你
<39-7,BECKETT>they didn't break you.

943
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,660
<39-7,BECKETT>你早就是这样了
<39-7,BECKETT>You were already broken.

944
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,100
<39-7,BECKETT>他们只是感受到你的本质
<39-7,BECKETT>They only sensed what you were

945
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,820
<39-7,BECKETT>和你即将成为的样子
<39-7,BECKETT>and what you were about to become.

946
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:18,380
<39-7,BECKETT>你知道吗
<39-7,BECKETT>So you know what?

947
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:22,840
<39-7,BECKETT>从某种角度来讲  他们的欺凌还不够
<39-7,BECKETT>In a way, their bullying wasn't enough.

948
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,180
<39-8,ADAM>你怎么能说这种话
<39-8,ADAM>How can you say that to me?

949
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:27,320
<39-8,ADAM>我是受害者
<39-8,ADAM>I'm the victim here.

950
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,710
<39-8,ADAM>你永远是受害者
<39-8,ADAM>And you're always gonna be a victim.

951
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:30,710
<39-9,BECKETT>你以为躲在一个用户名后
<39-9,BECKETT>You think that hiding behind a username

952
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:33,160
<39-9,BECKETT>肆意杀人就能改变一切吗
<39-9,BECKETT>and killing is going to change that?

953
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,600
<39-9,BECKETT>你不会得到尊敬
<39-9,BECKETT>That won't get you respect.

954
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:37,190
<39-9,BECKETT>你永远都是
<39-9,BECKETT>You're always gonna be

955
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,410
<39-9,BECKETT>那个可悲的失败者
<39-9,BECKETT>the same pathetic loser that you were!

956
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:40,770
<39-10,ADAM>我不是失败者
<39-10,ADAM>I'm not a loser!

957
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:42,980
<39-11,BECKETT>当你绑架肯特和奥伦时
<39-11,BECKETT>And when you abducted Kent and Oren,

958
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:45,040
<39-11,BECKETT>他们肯定望向彼此  在想
<39-11,BECKETT>I bet the two of them looked at each other and thought,

959
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:46,750
<39-11,BECKETT>我们被恶搞了吗
<39-11,BECKETT>"Are we being punk'd here?"

960
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:47,730
<39-12,ADAM>相信我  他们没有
<39-12,ADAM>Believe me, they didn't.

961
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:49,490
<39-13,BECKETT>-他们以为这是玩笑  -他们很害怕
<39-13,BECKETT>- They think it's a joke. - They're afraid.

962
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:50,540
<39-14,ADAM>他们吓坏了
<39-14,ADAM>They're -- they're terrified.

963
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:54,020
<39-15,BECKETT>他们现在在嘲笑你
<39-15,BECKETT>They're sharing a laugh right now about you.

964
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:56,200
<39-16,ADAM>没有
<39-16,ADAM>They are not laughing!

965
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:59,320
<40-1,CASTLE>她诱他说出他们在一起
<40-1,CASTLE>She just got him to say that they're together.

966
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:00,770
<40-1,CASTLE>他们在笑
<40-1,CASTLE>Oh, they're laughing.

967
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:03,040
<40-1,CASTLE>正开心地笑着
<40-1,CASTLE>They're laughing right now.

968
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,040
<40-1,CASTLE>笑不了多久了
<40-1,CASTLE>Well, not for long.

969
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,360
<41-1,BECKETT>时间归零
<41-1,BECKETT>That clock will hit zero,

970
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:09,140
<41-2,ADAM>他们吸入最后一口污浊的空气时
<41-2,ADAM>and their screams will echo off the tiled walls

971
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:12,060
<41-2,ADAM>他们的尖叫会在壁砖墙间回荡
<41-2,ADAM>as they take in their last breath of stale air.

972
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:15,470
<41-2,ADAM>之后他们都会被电死
<41-2,ADAM>And then they'll both fry.

973
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:19,100
<41-2,ADAM>壁砖墙和污浊的空气
<41-2,ADAM>Tiled walls and stale air?

974
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,280
<41-2,ADAM>他当时是这么描述学校更衣室的
<41-2,ADAM>That was how he talked about the locker room at his school.

975
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,750
<42-1,GARRETT>威瑟斯彭在那里拍了录像
<42-1,GARRETT>Where Witherspoon put him on video.

976
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:24,460
<42-2,CASTLE>他这是要在开始地方结束一切
<42-2,CASTLE>He's bringing this thing full circle.

977
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,680
<42-2,CASTLE>哪个高中
<42-2,CASTLE>What was the name of that high school?

978
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,240
<42-3,GARRETT>哈丁高中  但他们校园搬走了
<42-3,GARRETT>Harding High, but they moved to a new campus.

979
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,620
<42-3,GARRETT>原来的大楼封掉了
<42-3,GARRETT>The original building is shut down.

<43-2,ESPOSITO>Okay?

984
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:21,020
<44-1,GARRETT>感谢你们让我参与此案
<44-1,GARRETT>I just wanted to say thanks for letting me pitch in.

985
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:23,190
<44-2,BECKETT>你开玩笑吗  没有你我们破不了案的
<44-2,BECKETT>Are you kidding me? We couldn't have done this without you.

986
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:25,930
<44-3,CASTLE>奥伦和肯特活下来也都是因为你
<44-3,CASTLE>Yeah, Oren and Kent are alive because of your help.

<44-4,GARRETT>Well, it's always good to get a win.

<44-7,BECKETT>You know, there used to be some finality to all of this.

992
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,380
<44-7,BECKETT>照张照片  扔进盒子
<44-7,BECKETT>You took a photo, dump it in the box,

993
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:45,370
<44-7,BECKETT>再也不会看到那张脸
<44-7,BECKETT>and you never see that face again.

<44-7,BECKETT>再也不是了
