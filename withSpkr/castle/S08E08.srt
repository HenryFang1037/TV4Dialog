00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,080
<2-5,MARTHA>不论是眼泪
<2-5,MARTHA>Tears or...

<2-7,MARTHA>Guys, it was great.

23
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,870
<2-8,CASTLE>我所谓的很棒  是指经过了这几周
<2-8,CASTLE>And when I say "great," I mean, after the last few weeks,

24
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:16,060
<2-8,CASTLE>已经很不错了
<2-8,CASTLE>it was great.

25
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,930
<2-9,ALEXIS>那么你和贝克特是又在一起了吗
<2-9,ALEXIS>So does this mean you and Beckett are back together?

26
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,380
<2-10,CASTLE>我们...有进展了
<2-10,CASTLE>This means, uh, we're making progress.

27
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,020
<2-10,CASTLE>我会维持这份好运
<2-10,CASTLE>And I'm gonna, you know, keep the mojo going

28
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,710
<2-10,CASTLE>继续想办法参与她的凶案
<2-10,CASTLE>by wriggling my way into her homicide cases.

33
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,480
<2-15,MARTHA>或许这钱坑现在可以开始获利了
<2-15,MARTHA>Maybe now this money pit will turn a profit.

47
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,640
<2-28,HAYLEY>你俩的周年纪念中途中断了
<2-28,HAYLEY>that your anniversary was cut short

48
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,220
<2-28,HAYLEY>因为贝克特收到了一则神秘短信
<2-28,HAYLEY>when Beckett received a mystery text.

49
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,300
<2-29,CASTLE>我可能没提那部分
<2-29,CASTLE>I might have left that part out.

50
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:03,480
<2-30,HAYLEY>你是不是还忘了提
<2-30,HAYLEY>Oh, did you also maybe leave out

51
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,210
<2-30,HAYLEY>你叫我今早过来
<2-30,HAYLEY>the part where you asked me to come in this morning

52
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:07,050
<2-30,HAYLEY>好黑入贝克特的手机
<2-30,HAYLEY>in order to hack Beckett's cellphone

53
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:08,290
<2-30,HAYLEY>查明短信是谁发的
<2-30,HAYLEY>to tell you who sent her that text?

54
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:10,600
<2-31,CASTLE>好吧  我知道这看上去什么样
<2-31,CASTLE>Okay, I know how that looks, but

55
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:13,480
<2-31,CASTLE>但贝克特肯定有事
<2-31,CASTLE>something is going on with Beckett,

56
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,390
<2-31,CASTLE>我担心她
<2-31,CASTLE>and I-I-I'm worried about her.

57
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:16,570
<2-31,CASTLE>我知道
<2-31,CASTLE>I know.

<2-32,HAYLEY>好吧  你去做你该做的
<2-32,HAYLEY>Okay, you go do what you need to do.

<3-3,BECKETT>A strip club? Really?

73
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:59,760
<3-4,VIKRAM>你叫我找一个
<3-4,VIKRAM>Hey, you said to find a location

74
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,810
<3-4,VIKRAM>我们可以用来查洛克塞特的地方
<3-4,VIKRAM>where we could hunt for LokSat

75
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,620
<3-4,VIKRAM>而且完全不会被人监视
<3-4,VIKRAM>without anyone looking over our shoulders.

76
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,700
<3-5,BECKETT>这就是你能找到的最好的地方吗
<3-5,BECKETT>Yeah, and, uh, this is the best you could find?

77
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,710
<3-6,VIKRAM>多棒啊  风化组查抄了这里
<3-6,VIKRAM>It's perfect. Vice raided the place.

78
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:07,950
<3-6,VIKRAM>现在因审判而闲置
<3-6,VIKRAM>Now it's tied up in trial.

79
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:10,440
<3-6,VIKRAM>我们可以在这里工作数月  完全不会被发现
<3-6,VIKRAM>We can operate here for months completely off the grid.

00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,860
<3-6,VIKRAM>再有  我也可以练练舞步
<3-6,VIKRAM>Plus, I can work out my core.

<3-7,BECKETT>So, the text from last night. What did you find?

00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:18,700
<3-7,BECKETT>其实
<3-7,BECKETT>Actually, uh...

83
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,150
<3-8,VIKRAM>那个线索无果
<3-8,VIKRAM>that's a dead end.

84
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,020
<3-10,VIKRAM>-什么  -抱歉
<3-10,VIKRAM>- What? - My bad.

85
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,510
<3-11,BECKETT>你昨晚不知道吗
<3-11,BECKETT>A-and you didn't know this last night?

86
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:28,870
<3-13,BECKETT>你给我发短信就是为了打断我和卡塞尔的
<3-13,BECKETT>Did you text me to pull me out of my anniversary dinner

87
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,130
<3-13,BECKETT>周年纪念晚宴吗
<3-13,BECKETT>with Castle?

88
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,770
<3-14,VIKRAM>听我说  你跟他分手是有原因的
<3-14,VIKRAM>Look, you broke up with him for a reason.

89
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,900
<3-14,VIKRAM>绝不能让任何人知道我们在做什么  尤其卡塞尔
<3-14,VIKRAM>No one can know what we're doing, especially Castle.

90
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,870
<3-14,VIKRAM>-这太危险了  -我知道
<3-14,VIKRAM>- It's too dangerous. - I know.

91
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,680
<3-15,BECKETT>我已经格外小心了
<3-15,BECKETT>And I am being extremely careful.

92
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,840
<3-15,BECKETT>我只是想尽量不因此毁了我的婚姻
<3-15,BECKETT>I'm just trying not to lose my marriage in the process.

94
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:50,470
<3-15,BECKETT>好的  停尸房见
<3-15,BECKETT>Okay, I'll meet you at the morgue.

<3-15,BECKETT>79街船坞发现一具浮尸
<3-15,BECKETT>They found a floater at the 79th street boat basin.

96
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:56,060
<3-15,BECKETT>我得走了
<3-15,BECKETT>I got to go.

97
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:01,830
<3-16,VIKRAM>还挺合适的
<3-16,VIKRAM>Oddly validating.

98
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,280
<4-1,JAVIER ESPOSITO>帕穆特
<4-1,JAVIER ESPOSITO>Yo, Perlmutter.

99
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,010
<4-1,JAVIER ESPOSITO>你现在要完全走颓废风了啊
<4-1,JAVIER ESPOSITO>Oh, so you're going full hipster now.

100
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:09,540
<4-2,KEVIN RYAN>你开始腌手工咸菜了吗
<4-2,KEVIN RYAN>Yeah, have you started jarring artisanal pickles yet?

101
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,280
<4-3,SIDNEY PERLMUTTER>你们还带着段子而来  真好
<4-3,SIDNEY PERLMUTTER>Ah, you've come bearing jokes. Wonderful.

102
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,430
<4-4,BECKETT>确认身份了吗
<4-4,BECKETT>So, we get an I.D. yet?

103
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,590
<4-5,PERLMUTTER>没有  是位无名氏
<4-5,PERLMUTTER>Uh, no. She's a Jane Doe.

104
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:18,630
<4-5,PERLMUTTER>20多  接触性枪伤
<4-5,PERLMUTTER>20s, contact gunshot wound.

105
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:21,070
<4-5,PERLMUTTER>看来她是以枪决形式被杀
<4-5,PERLMUTTER>Looks like she was killed execution style,

106
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,220
<4-5,PERLMUTTER>然后被弃尸水中
<4-5,PERLMUTTER>then dumped in the water.

107
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,040
<4-6,BECKETT>听上去像黑帮干的
<4-6,BECKETT>Sounds like a mob hit.

108
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,310
<4-7,RYAN>谁啊  阿尔·卡彭吗
<4-7,RYAN>From who? Al capone?

109
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:27,320
<4-7,RYAN>那是一条20年代的裙子
<4-7,RYAN>That dress is straight out of the '20s.

110
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,110
<4-8,PERLMUTTER>这是戏服  警探
<4-8,PERLMUTTER>Uh, it's a costume, detective.

111
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:31,190
<4-8,PERLMUTTER>"标志邮轮公司物品"
<4-8,PERLMUTTER>"Property of Iconic Cruise Lines."

112
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,060
<4-9,BECKETT>那么无名氏
<4-9,BECKETT>So, our Jane Doe

113
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,350
<4-9,BECKETT>一定是邮轮上的表演者
<4-9,BECKETT>must have been a cruise-ship entertainer.

114
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,830
<4-10,RYAN>那么她可能是死在
<4-10,RYAN>So she could have been killed aboard

115
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:36,960
<4-10,RYAN>大西洋任何一艘船上
<4-10,RYAN>any ship in the Atlantic

116
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:38,310
<4-10,RYAN>然后随海流漂了过来
<4-10,RYAN>and drifted here on the currents.

117
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:41,110
<4-11,PERLMUTTER>或许不是  尸体漂白
<4-11,PERLMUTTER>Or not. Based on the modest level

118
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,690
<4-11,PERLMUTTER>和浮肿程度并不重
<4-11,PERLMUTTER>of blanching and bloating,

119
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:45,250
<4-11,PERLMUTTER>她的尸体入睡还不到10到12小时
<4-11,PERLMUTTER>her body's been in the water less than 10 to 12 hours.

120
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,640
<4-12,BECKETT>那么她所乘的船可能还在附近
<4-12,BECKETT>So whatever boat she was on could still be nearby.

121
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:50,070
<4-13,PERLMUTTER>-各位  我们先...  -等等
<4-13,PERLMUTTER>- You know what, guys, let's start with... - Now, hold on.

122
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:00,480
<4-14,PERLMUTTER>有段牙线
<4-14,PERLMUTTER>Some kind of floss...

123
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,630
<4-14,PERLMUTTER>系在后臼齿上了
<4-14,PERLMUTTER>...tied to her back molar...

124
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:10,000
<4-14,PERLMUTTER>一直深入她喉咙里
<4-14,PERLMUTTER>...going down her throat.

125
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,250
<4-15,RYAN>如果这是我想的那个东西
<4-15,RYAN>If that's what I think it is,

126
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:24,130
<4-15,RYAN>这位无名氏可能还兼职做偷运
<4-15,RYAN>this Jane Doe could have had a little side business smuggling.

127
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:26,060
<4-16,ESPOSITO>邮轮是贩卖毒品的好地方
<4-16,ESPOSITO>A cruise ship is a good place to sell drugs.

128
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,870
<4-16,ESPOSITO>国际港口  很不错的客户群
<4-16,ESPOSITO>International ports, a captive customer base.

129
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:32,230
<4-17,RYAN>或许她被卷入了船上的地盘战
<4-17,RYAN>Maybe she got involved in a little on-board turf war,

130
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:33,550
<4-17,RYAN>对手干掉了她
<4-17,RYAN>and the competition took her out.

131
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,010
<4-18,BECKETT>但为什么只有一包啊
<4-18,BECKETT>Except why just one bag?

132
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:37,430
<4-18,BECKETT>如果她真是毒贩
<4-18,BECKETT>I mean, if she was an actual mule,

133
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:39,880
<4-18,BECKETT>-我们该拉出20包才对  -至少
<4-18,BECKETT>- we'd be pulling out 20 of those. - At least.

134
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,360
<4-20,PERLMUTTER>我会让实验室加急检测一下
<4-20,PERLMUTTER>I'll put a rush on this at the lab.

135
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:43,250
<4-21,BECKETT>现在  我们去查查
<4-21,BECKETT>Meanwhile, we need to figure out

136
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,340
<4-21,BECKETT>无名氏原来是在哪艘标志邮轮上
<4-21,BECKETT>which Iconic Cruise Ship our Jane Doe was on,

137
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,540
<4-21,BECKETT>那是犯罪现场
<4-21,BECKETT>because that's our crime scene.

138
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,910
<5-1,RYAN>我刚跟标志邮轮公司通过电话
<5-1,RYAN>I just got off the phone with Iconic Cruise Lines.

139
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,850
<5-1,RYAN>被害人叫劳拉·麦登
<5-1,RYAN>Our victim is Lara Madden.

140
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:59,760
<5-1,RYAN>是舞剧《地下酒吧》的一位舞者
<5-1,RYAN>She was a dancer in their show called "Speakeasy."

141
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,120
<5-1,RYAN>昨晚还进行过表演
<5-1,RYAN>Apparently she performed in it last night.

142
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,860
<5-2,BECKETT>那怪不得穿成那样
<5-2,BECKETT>Okay, well, that - explains the flapper dress.

143
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:03,970
<5-3,RYAN>她所工作的船
<5-3,RYAN>And the boat she worked on

144
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:06,390
<5-3,RYAN>是一艘老式泰坦尼克号年代主题的远洋油轮
<5-3,RYAN>is an old "Titanic"-era-themed oceanliner

145
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,910
<5-3,RYAN>本特利皇家邮轮
<5-3,RYAN>bamed the RMS Bently.

146
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:10,470
<5-3,RYAN>破晓时停靠进了曼哈顿邮轮码头
<5-3,RYAN>It put into port at Manhattan Cruise Terminal at dawn.

147
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,010
<5-4,BECKETT>密歇根人
<5-4,BECKETT>Michigan I.D.?

148
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:14,520
<5-5,BECKETT>联络亲属了吗
<5-5,BECKETT>You contact her next-of-kin?

149
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,020
<5-6,RYAN>嗯  她妈妈今天晚些时候会飞来
<5-6,RYAN>Yeah, her mother is flying in later today.

150
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:18,410
<5-6,RYAN>她说劳拉
<5-6,RYAN>She said that Lara

151
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:20,660
<5-6,RYAN>辞去了一家环境非盈利机构的职位
<5-6,RYAN>quit her job at an environmental nonprofit

152
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,210
<5-6,RYAN>就为去邮轮上工作
<5-6,RYAN>in order to work on the cruise line,

153
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,450
<5-6,RYAN>好帮助家人还债
<5-6,RYAN>all to help her family get out of debt.

154
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:25,610
<5-7,ESPOSITO>帕穆特刚刚打来了
<5-7,ESPOSITO>Perlmutter just called.

155
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:27,720
<5-7,ESPOSITO>劳拉胃里的那个包
<5-7,ESPOSITO>Turns out that baggie from Lara's stomach...

156
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:29,840
<5-7,ESPOSITO>-是高纯海洛因  -高纯
<5-7,ESPOSITO>- pure uncut heroin. - Uncut?

157
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,870
<5-8,RYAN>怪不得她只吞了一包
<5-8,RYAN>No wonder she only swallowed one baggie.

158
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,030
<5-8,RYAN>那一小袋价值三万呢
<5-8,RYAN>That 8-ball has a street value of $30k.

159
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:36,210
<5-9,BECKETT>高纯海洛因都直接来自毒品集团
<5-9,BECKETT>Uncut heroin - comes directly from the cartel,

160
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:38,310
<5-9,BECKETT>一个密歇根来的舞者是怎么拿到的
<5-9,BECKETT>so how does a dancer from Michigan get her hands on that?

161
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:40,060
<5-10,ESPOSITO>或许是船上任何人给的
<5-10,ESPOSITO>It could have came from anybody on the ship.

162
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,040
<5-10,ESPOSITO>问题是  我们的嫌疑人
<5-10,ESPOSITO>The problem is, all of our suspects

163
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,030
<5-10,ESPOSITO>今早都下船了
<5-10,ESPOSITO>disembarked this morning.

164
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:44,460
<5-11,RYAN>嗯  两千人呢
<5-11,RYAN>Yeah, like 2,000 of them.

165
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,340
<5-11,RYAN>而且可能去了全城各处
<5-11,RYAN>They're probably all over the city

166
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,280
<5-11,RYAN>或者现在已经飞了回去
<5-11,RYAN>or flying back to wherever they came from by now.

167
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,530
<5-12,BECKETT>你们查查乘客和
<5-12,BECKETT>Okay, why don't you guys run the names

168
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,640
<5-12,BECKETT>船员名单
<5-12,BECKETT>from all the passenger and crew manifests?

169
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,760
<5-12,BECKETT>看看有没有什么结果
<5-12,BECKETT>See if anything pops.

170
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,000
<5-12,BECKETT>我去船上
<5-12,BECKETT>I'll head off to the ship,

171
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:55,650
<5-12,BECKETT>看能不能找到犯罪现场
<5-12,BECKETT>see if I can find an actual crime scene.

172
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,500
<6-1,JANICE ELDEN>标志公司以两件事为傲
<6-1,JANICE ELDEN>Here at Iconic, we pride ourselves on two things--

173
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:01,630
<6-1,JANICE ELDEN>老式海洋旅行的优雅
<6-1,JANICE ELDEN>The old-world elegance of ocean travel

174
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:04,150
<6-1,JANICE ELDEN>和我们完美的安全记录
<6-1,JANICE ELDEN>and our impeccable safety record.

175
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,190
<6-1,JANICE ELDEN>所以不管劳拉遭遇了什么事
<6-1,JANICE ELDEN>So I'm sure whatever happened to Lara

176
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:08,070
<6-1,JANICE ELDEN>肯定只是一起不幸事故
<6-1,JANICE ELDEN>was simply a tragic accident.

177
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,340
<6-2,BECKETT>她头部中枪
<6-2,BECKETT>Uh, well, she was shot in the head,

178
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,730
<6-2,BECKETT>除非她是绊倒摔在了一颗子弹上
<6-2,BECKETT>so unless she tripped and fell on a bullet,

179
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,100
<6-2,BECKETT>那就不是意外
<6-2,BECKETT>it wasn't an accident.

180
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:16,090
<6-2,BECKETT>我以为你们的乘客
<6-2,BECKETT>Now, I thought that all of your passengers

181
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:17,370
<6-3,JANICE>今早都下船了呢
<6-3,JANICE>disembarked this morning.

182
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:19,420
<6-3,JANICE>那是一些长期住在船上的旅客
<6-3,JANICE>Oh, those are some - of the ship's resident guests,

183
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:21,630
<6-3,JANICE>大都是退休人士  常年住在船上
<6-3,JANICE>mostly retirees - who live aboard year-round.

184
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,570
<6-3,JANICE>有一些旅客  比如尼尔森姐妹
<6-3,JANICE>Some of them, like the Nelson sisters,

185
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:25,430
<6-3,JANICE>在船上待的时间比大部分船员都久
<6-3,JANICE>have been on the ship longer than most of the crew.

186
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,580
<6-3,JANICE>我们叫她们"八卦天后"
<6-3,JANICE>We call them "The gossip girls."

187
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,610
<6-4,BECKETT>抱歉  我得接一下
<6-4,BECKETT>Um, I-I'm sorry, I have to get this.

188
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:30,750
<6-5,JANICE>当然
<6-5,JANICE>Oh, sure thing.

189
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,500
<6-6,BECKETT>维克拉姆  有什么发现
<6-6,BECKETT>Hey, Vikram, what do you got?

190
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,850
<6-7,VIKRAM>我们找到了金矿
<6-7,VIKRAM>We hit the mother lode.

191
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:36,580
<6-7,VIKRAM>我查了被害人胃里的那份海洛因
<6-7,VIKRAM>I ran the heroin found in our victim's stomach.

192
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:39,170
<6-7,VIKRAM>贝克特  与瓦肯·西蒙斯
<6-7,VIKRAM>Beckett, it's an exact 100% match

193
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:40,880
<6-7,VIKRAM>所出售的海洛因完全匹配
<6-7,VIKRAM>to the heroin Vulcan Simmons was selling.

194
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,180
<6-8,BECKETT>那么杀劳拉的凶手
<6-8,BECKETT>So Lara's killer is linked

195
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,780
<6-8,BECKETT>跟接管了瓦肯毒品交易的人有关
<6-8,BECKETT>to whoever took over Vulcan's drug pipeline.

196
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:48,200
<6-9,VIKRAM>这就是我们一直在等的
<6-9,VIKRAM>This is it... what we've been waiting for.

197
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:49,970
<6-9,VIKRAM>你能相信居然来自我们自己的案件吗
<6-9,VIKRAM>And do you believe it came from one of our own cases?

198
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:52,270
<6-10,BECKETT>好了  我们得小心
<6-10,BECKETT>Okay, we have to be careful.

199
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:54,100
<6-10,BECKETT>我们不能让人知道我们知情  暴露身份
<6-10,BECKETT>We can't let on that we know anything and blow our cover.

200
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:57,080
<6-10,BECKETT>-而且不仅是中情局里的那个目标  -嗯
<6-10,BECKETT>- And I'm not just talking about the target in the CIA. - Yeah.

201
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:00,010
<6-11,VIKRAM>-幸好卡塞尔这次没在  -是啊
<6-11,VIKRAM>- Good thing Castle's nowhere near this one. - Yeah.

202
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:01,270
<6-12,BECKETT>嘿
<6-12,BECKETT>Ahoy!

203
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:04,180
<6-13,CASTLE>我是世界之王[出自《泰坦尼克号》]
<6-13,CASTLE>I'm the king of the world!

204
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,730
<6-14,VIKRAM>喂  贝克特
<6-14,VIKRAM>Hello? Beckett?

205
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:09,040
<6-15,BECKETT>这不是真的
<6-15,BECKETT>This can't be happening.

206
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:11,520
<7-1,BECKETT>你是怎么上船的
<7-1,BECKETT>How did you get on board?

207
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:13,770
<7-2,CASTLE>我们一直在谈论要买艘船
<7-2,CASTLE>You know, we always talked about buying a boat.

208
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,950
<7-2,CASTLE>你觉得呢  我知道需要修补一下
<7-2,CASTLE>What do you think? I mean, I know it's a fixer-upper.

209
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,380
<7-3,BECKETT>不知道  结婚两周年再买吧
<7-3,BECKETT>I don't know -- maybe for our second anniversary.

210
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,890
<7-4,CASTLE>我觉得没什么能跟第一年这次相比
<7-4,CASTLE>Oh, I don't know if anything's gonna compare to the first.

211
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:25,050
<7-5,BECKETT>你真的不应该来这儿
<7-5,BECKETT>You know, you really shouldn't be here.

212
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,340
<7-6,CASTLE>为什么
<7-6,CASTLE>Why not?

213
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,640
<7-7,BECKETT>船开了吗
<7-7,BECKETT>Are we moving?

214
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,370
<7-8,CASTLE>贝克特  犯罪现场貌似是想逃跑
<7-8,CASTLE>Beckett, I think your crime scene's making a run for it.

224
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:49,090
<8-1,BECKETT>船长  你得把船停下
<8-1,BECKETT>Captain, you need to stop this ship.

225
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,370
<8-2,CAPTAIN ZIERING>不可能
<8-2,CAPTAIN ZIERING>That's not gonna happen.

226
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:51,980
<8-3,CASTLE>船长  我们正在调查
<8-3,CASTLE>Captain, we're investigating the murder

227
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,090
<8-3,CASTLE>你船上一名舞者被杀的案子
<8-3,CASTLE>of one of your ship's dancers.

228
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:55,140
<8-4,CAPTAIN ZIERING>总部命令我出港
<8-4,CAPTAIN ZIERING>I'm under orders from headquarters to get under way.

229
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,720
<8-5,BECKETT>你是说标志邮轮公司
<8-5,BECKETT>Are you telling me that Iconic Cruise Lines

230
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:58,310
<8-5,BECKETT>想要掩盖这起凶杀案吗
<8-5,BECKETT>is trying to cover up the murder?

231
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:00,770
<8-6,CAPTAIN ZIERING>跟你这么说吧  公司快要破产了
<8-6,CAPTAIN ZIERING>I'm telling you the company's near bankruptcy.

232
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:02,330
<8-6,CAPTAIN ZIERING>不能再有负面新闻了
<8-6,CAPTAIN ZIERING>They can't afford the bad press.

233
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:05,050
<8-7,BECKETT>立刻停船  否则我会起诉你妨碍司法
<8-7,BECKETT>Stop this ship, or I will charge you with obstruction.

234
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,350
<8-7,BECKETT>我可以让海岸警卫队禁止这艘船航行
<8-7,BECKETT>I can call the coast guard to interdict this vessel.

235
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,060
<8-8,CAPTAIN ZIERING>你当然可以
<8-8,CAPTAIN ZIERING>Sure, you can.

236
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,480
<8-8,CAPTAIN ZIERING>不过咱俩都清楚
<8-8,CAPTAIN ZIERING>But you know as well as I do

237
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,560
<8-8,CAPTAIN ZIERING>等到他们出动的时候
<8-8,CAPTAIN ZIERING>that by the time you activate them,

238
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,170
<8-8,CAPTAIN ZIERING>我们就已经到公海了
<8-8,CAPTAIN ZIERING>we'll be in international waters.

239
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,120
<8-9,CASTLE>那里不受美国法律的约束
<8-9,CASTLE>Where U.S. laws don't apply.

240
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,080
<8-9,CASTLE>标志公司就打的这个盘算
<8-9,CASTLE>That's what Iconic is counting on.

241
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,810
<8-10,CAPTAIN ZIERING>告诉你们俩一声
<8-10,CAPTAIN ZIERING>Oh, and just so the two of you know,

242
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:18,990
<8-10,CAPTAIN ZIERING>大约一个小时后会有艘船来接你们
<8-10,CAPTAIN ZIERING>they're sending a boat to pick you up in about an hour.

243
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:20,630
<8-11,CASTLE>这么说我们只有60分钟的时间
<8-11,CASTLE>So we've got 60 minutes to investigate this murder

244
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:22,420
<8-11,CASTLE>在犯罪现场进行调查了
<8-11,CASTLE>before we lose access to our crime scene.

245
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,780
<8-12,CAPTAIN ZIERING>-关于这个  -不是吧
<8-12,CAPTAIN ZIERING>- And about that... - Really?

246
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,200
<8-13,CASTLE>上面命令我要求船员
<8-13,CASTLE>I've been instructed to order the crew

00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,720
<8-14,CAPTAIN ZIERING>不许跟你们配合
<8-14,CAPTAIN ZIERING>not to cooperate with you.

<8-16,CASTLE>没错  我去跟劳拉的舞者朋友们谈谈
<8-16,CASTLE>Right. I'll talk to Lara's dancer friends.

251
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:35,490
<8-16,CASTLE>她们可能是最后见到她的人
<8-16,CASTLE>They may be the last ones to see her alive.

252
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:37,540
<8-17,BECKETT>好的  可你要记住  她们不会配合我们的

253
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,350
<8-17,BECKETT>所以别告诉她们你是帮警察工作的
<8-17,BECKETT>So don't tell them that you're working with the police.

254
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:40,450
<8-18,CASTLE>那你去哪

00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:45,570
<8-19,BECKETT>那一定就是她们了
<8-19,BECKETT>it's gonna be them.

258
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:47,060
<8-19,BECKETT>况且  她们也不是船员
<8-19,BECKETT>And plus, they're not with the crew.

259
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,690
<8-20,CASTLE>好吧  如果她们像我母亲
<8-20,CASTLE>All right, if they're anything like my mother,

<8-20,CASTLE>那你一定会忙不过来的

<12-7,BECKETT>她的尸体昨晚被冲上岸了
<12-7,BECKETT>Her body washed up last night.

361
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,660
<12-7,BECKETT>她是不是偷了你的毒品  所以你才杀了她
<12-7,BECKETT>Did she steal your drugs? Is that why you killed her?

362
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,900
<12-8,ISAAC>等等  你在说什么啊
<12-8,ISAAC>Wait, what are you talking about?

363
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:25,990
<12-9,BECKETT>我们知道你在贩毒
<12-9,BECKETT>We know you deal drugs.

364
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:27,870
<12-9,BECKETT>我们在她的体内发现了高纯海洛因
<12-9,BECKETT>We found your uncut heroin on her body.

365
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:29,200
<12-10,ISAAC>等等  我是卖大麻的
<12-10,ISAAC>Slow down -- I sell weed.

366
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,900
<12-11,BECKETT>那你的上家呢
<12-11,BECKETT>And what about the people that you work for?

367
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,730
<12-12,ISAAC>我是从各个港口的小毒贩那里进货
<12-12,ISAAC>I get my product from petty dealers at the ports.

368
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:35,380
<12-12,ISAAC>我没加入什么组织  更没杀劳拉  我发誓
<12-12,ISAAC>I'm not tapped in. And I didn't kill Lara, I swear.

369
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,330
<12-13,BECKETT>昨晚你在哪
<12-13,BECKETT>Where were you last night?

370
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,900
<12-14,ISAAC>一直在这待到凌晨三点
<12-14,ISAAC>Here until 3:00 A.M.,

371
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:40,380
<12-14,ISAAC>给一群喝醉的游客调鸡尾酒
<12-14,ISAAC>serving cocktails to a bunch of drunk tourists.

372
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:44,180
<12-14,ISAAC>等等  可我在劳拉表演完后见到过她
<12-14,ISAAC>Wait, but I did see Lara after her show

373
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,960
<12-14,ISAAC>大约在昨晚11点左右
<12-14,ISAAC>around 11:00 last night.

374
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:48,230
<12-14,ISAAC>她还穿着表演服
<12-14,ISAAC>She was still dressed in her costume,

375
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:49,200
<12-14,ISAAC>急着去救生艇甲板
<12-14,ISAAC>rushing to the boat deck.

376
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,400
<12-15,BECKETT>有人跟她一起吗
<12-15,BECKETT>Was she with anyone?

377
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,560
<12-16,ISAAC>我没看见
<12-16,ISAAC>Not that I could see.

378
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,810
<13-1,SARAH>准备好再来一遍了吗  戴夫
<13-1,SARAH>You ready to go again, Dave?

379
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,600
<13-3,CASTLE>-我们休息五分钟  -休息五分钟
<13-3,CASTLE>- Let's take five, people. - Take five, people.

380
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,070
<13-4,CASTLE>听说你是  劳拉的铺友
<13-4,CASTLE>So, you're, Lara's roommate.

381
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:14,080
<13-5,BETHANY>你不是说你当过职业舞蹈演员吗
<13-5,BETHANY>Thought you said you had professional dancing experience.

382
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:16,970
<13-6,CASTLE>是的  跳的是方块舞
<13-6,CASTLE>Yeah, I was a professional square dancer.

383
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:18,110
<13-6,CASTLE>没这么累
<13-6,CASTLE>A lot less cardio.

384
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:19,100
<13-7,BETHANY>真好
<13-7,BETHANY>Great.

385
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,930
<13-8,CASTLE>听我说  我不是什么戴夫·席尔默
<13-8,CASTLE>Listen, I'm not really Dave Schirmer.

386
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:27,800
<13-8,CASTLE>我是跟纽约警局合作的私家侦探
<13-8,CASTLE>I'm a private investigator working with the NYPD.

387
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,740
<13-8,CASTLE>很遗憾的通知你劳拉被杀了
<13-8,CASTLE>I'm sorry to tell you Lara's been murdered.

388
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,110
<13-9,BETHANY>被杀  等等  你说什么
<13-9,BETHANY>Murdered? Wait, what?

389
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:33,970
<13-10,CASTLE>你知道她跟船上的什么人有矛盾吗
<13-10,CASTLE>Do you know if she had a problem with anyone on the ship?

390
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,780
<13-11,BETHANY>-我不知道  -好吧
<13-11,BETHANY>- I don't think so. - Okay.

391
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:38,670
<13-12,CASTLE>-她最近有什么不寻常的举动吗  -有
<13-12,CASTLE>- Had she been acting unusually recently? - Yeah.

392
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,830
<13-13,BETHANY>最近  劳拉空闲的时候
<13-13,BETHANY>Lately, Lara was spending a lot of her free time

393
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:42,230
<13-13,BETHANY>都在下层甲板轮机室
<13-13,BETHANY>below decks in engineering.

394
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:44,240
<13-14,CASTLE>-你知道为什么吗  -她不肯说
<13-14,CASTLE>- Do you know why? - She wouldn't talk about it.

395
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,860
<13-15,BETHANY>我能不能去一下你们的舱房
<13-15,BETHANY>Can I go down to your bunk

396
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,520
<13-16,CASTLE>看一下劳拉的东西
<13-16,CASTLE>just to look through Lara's things,

397
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,550
<13-16,CASTLE>看看她有没有日记什么的
<13-16,CASTLE>see if she had a diary or anything

398
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:51,090
<13-16,CASTLE>能帮我们找到她的凶手
<13-16,CASTLE>that might help find her killer.

399
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:52,750
<13-17,BETHANY>就算劳拉写日记
<13-17,BETHANY>If Lara had a diary,

400
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,940
<13-17,BETHANY>她也绝不会放在我们舱房里
<13-17,BETHANY>the last place she would keep it is in our bunk.

401
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:57,340
<13-17,BETHANY>这艘破船上经常有人偷东西
<13-17,BETHANY>Things get stolen all the time on this raggedy ship.

402
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:58,840
<13-17,BETHANY>我们都有秘密藏东西的地方
<13-17,BETHANY>We all have secret stash spots.

403
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,090
<13-17,BETHANY>有些地方你根本想不到
<13-17,BETHANY>Some of them are pretty creative.

404
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:01,940
<13-18,CASTLE>你知道劳拉把东西藏在哪吗
<13-18,CASTLE>Do you have any idea where Lara's stash spot was?

405
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,210
<13-19,BETHANY>抱歉
<13-19,BETHANY>Sorry.

406
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:04,080
<13-20,CASTLE>谢谢你的帮助
<13-20,CASTLE>Thank you for your help.

407
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,280
<14-1,BECKETT>有进展吗
<14-1,BECKETT>Get anything?

408
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,470
<14-2,CASTLE>腹股沟拉伤  还有条潜在的线索
<14-2,CASTLE>A pulled groin and a potential clue.

409
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,130
<14-2,CASTLE>劳拉经常去下层甲板轮机室
<14-2,CASTLE>Lara spent a lot of time below decks in engineering.

410
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:12,070
<14-2,CASTLE>你呢
<14-2,CASTLE>How about you?

411
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:14,360
<14-3,BECKETT>一个酒保昨晚表演结束后
<14-3,BECKETT>A bartender saw Lara after the show last night

412
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,050
<14-3,BECKETT>看见劳拉站在23号支架旁
<14-3,BECKETT>standing by the gantry 23.

413
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:18,740
<14-4,CASTLE>也许她去和做毒品交易的人碰面但出了问题
<14-4,CASTLE>Maybe she met someone for a drug deal and things went sideways.

414
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,470
<14-5,BECKETT>也许她被人跟踪了
<14-5,BECKETT>Or maybe she was being followed.

415
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:22,390
<14-5,BECKETT>不管怎样  我要去救生艇甲板上看看
<14-5,BECKETT>Either way, I'm going down to the boat deck,

416
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:24,330
<14-5,BECKETT>看她有没有留下什么蛛丝马迹
<14-5,BECKETT>see if she left any breadcrumbs behind.

417
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,380
<14-6,CASTLE>在那见
<14-6,CASTLE>Meet you there.

418
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:28,900
<15-1,CASTLE>这儿什么都没有
<15-1,CASTLE>There's nothing here.

419
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,260
<15-2,BECKETT>对  看上去甲板好像被清理过
<15-2,BECKETT>Yeah, it looks like the deck's been cleaned --

420
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,130
<15-2,BECKETT>没有留下什么痕迹
<15-2,BECKETT>There's no breadcrumbs.

421
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:34,750
<15-3,CASTLE>除非
<15-3,CASTLE>Unless...

422
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:36,630
<15-3,CASTLE>她室友说
<15-3,CASTLE>Her roommate said

423
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,240
<15-3,CASTLE>船员会在船上藏东西
<15-3,CASTLE>that the crew stashed things all over this ship.

424
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,330
<15-3,CASTLE>万一这里是劳拉藏东西的地方呢
<15-3,CASTLE>What if this was the spot where Lara kept her stash?

425
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,210
<15-4,BECKETT>表演结束后她可能来到这
<15-4,BECKETT>She could have come here after the show,

426
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:45,510
<15-4,BECKETT>在船驶入港口前把那包毒品吞了进去
<15-4,BECKETT>swallowed the bag before they put into port.

427
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:47,460
<15-5,CASTLE>好吧  这儿什么地方能藏东西
<15-5,CASTLE>Okay, so where do you hide something up here?

428
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,640
<15-5,CASTLE>卡塞尔
<15-5,CASTLE>Castle?

429
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,180
<15-6,BECKETT>我们找到了犯罪现场
<15-6,BECKETT>We found the crime scene.

430
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,180
<15-7,BECKETT>凶手肯定是在这开枪打死了劳拉
<15-7,BECKETT>Killer must have shot Lara here

431
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,890
<15-7,BECKETT>然后把她的尸体抛进了海里
<15-7,BECKETT>and then dumped her body overboard.

432
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,880
<15-8,CASTLE>我们快没时间了
<15-8,CASTLE>Okay, we are running out of time.

433
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,880
<15-8,CASTLE>在被赶下船之前我们还有20分钟
<15-8,CASTLE>We got 20 minutes before we're kicked off the ship for good.

434
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,440
<15-9,BECKETT>好的  她被枪击中头部
<15-9,BECKETT>All right, she was shot in the head,

435
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,160
<15-9,BECKETT>应该会有更多血才对
<15-9,BECKETT>so there should be a lot more blood.

436
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,320
<15-9,BECKETT>这边
<15-9,BECKETT>And there we go...

437
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:12,520
<15-9,BECKETT>这儿有残留血迹
<15-9,BECKETT>Blood residue right here.

438
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:14,420
<15-10,CASTLE>看上去好像凶手在这留下了脚印
<15-10,CASTLE>Looks like the killer tracked footprints through it.

439
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:17,310
<15-11,BECKETT>你能把脚放在边上吗
<15-11,BECKETT>Uh, you know, can you put your shoe against it,

440
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,610
<15-11,BECKETT>当做比例尺
<15-11,BECKETT>Just for scale?

441
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:23,800
<15-12,CASTLE>你知道吗  我们真的应该坐一次邮轮
<15-12,CASTLE>You know, we really - should take a little cruise.

442
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:26,830
<15-12,CASTLE>想象一下我们能经历多少浪漫神秘的小插曲
<15-12,CASTLE>Imagine all the romantic secret interludes we could have.

443
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,660
<15-13,BECKETT>你是说像《泰坦尼克号》里面的场景
<15-13,BECKETT>You mean like that scene in "Titanic,"

444
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,910
<15-13,BECKETT>在老车子上的那一幕吗
<15-13,BECKETT>the one in the old car?

445
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:34,450
<15-14,CASTLE>对  杰克和罗斯还有起了水雾的窗户
<15-14,CASTLE>Yeah, Jack and Rose and the steamy window.

446
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:36,270
<15-14,CASTLE>我们可以跳进一艘救生艇里
<15-14,CASTLE>We could just jump in one of these life boats.

447
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:38,680
<15-15,BECKETT>救生艇
<15-15,BECKETT>The life boats.

448
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,960
<15-17,BECKETT>我不知道  卡塞尔  要进去貌似很难
<15-17,BECKETT>I don't know, Castle. It would be tough to get in.

449
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,560
<15-18,CASTLE>这里呢
<15-18,CASTLE>What about right here?

450
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,820
<15-19,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<15-19,BECKETT>Castle.

451
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,920
<15-20,BECKETT>那些肯定就是高纯海洛因
<15-20,BECKETT>That must be the uncut heroin.

452
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,520
<15-21,MAN>阿科斯塔  他们让你去B甲板
<15-21,MAN>Hey, Acosta, they want you on "B" Deck.

453
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,740
<15-22,ACOSTA>我马上就去
<15-22,ACOSTA>I'll be right there.

454
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,620
<15-23,LARA>谢天谢地他没看见我
<15-23,LARA>Thank god he didn't see me.

455
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:51,190
<15-23,LARA>我不知道怎么办
<15-23,LARA>I don't know what to do.

456
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,270
<15-23,LARA>我不能相信这船上的人
<15-23,LARA>I can't trust anyone on the ship.

457
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:55,490
<15-23,LARA>我要
<15-23,LARA>I'll just...

458
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:58,130
<15-23,LARA>我要拿些证据给警察
<15-23,LARA>I'll grab some evidence for the cops.

459
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:03,350
<15-24,BECKETT>那个肯定就是我们要找的毒贩
<15-24,BECKETT>And that must be our drug dealer.

460
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,060
<15-25,CASTLE>我想她在四处打探时发现了那些毒品
<15-25,CASTLE>I bet she was snooping around and discovered those drugs.

461
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:11,490
<15-26,BECKETT>她太害怕了不敢相信任何人
<15-26,BECKETT>Except she was too scared to trust anyone,

462
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,750
<15-26,BECKETT>所以就决定偷走一些样品
<15-26,BECKETT>so she decided to smuggle out a sample.

463
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,550
<15-27,CASTLE>她肯定在表演前把相机藏了起来
<15-27,CASTLE>I bet she hid the camera before the show

464
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:16,520
<15-27,CASTLE>之后又回来拿
<15-27,CASTLE>and came back afterwards.

465
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:17,610
<15-28,BECKETT>她没能回来
<15-28,BECKETT>She never made it.

466
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,560
<15-28,BECKETT>他肯定看到了她
<15-28,BECKETT>He must have seen her.

467
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,210
<15-28,BECKETT>表演结束后他跟踪她到这儿  把她杀了
<15-28,BECKETT>He followed her after the show, and then he killed her.

468
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:23,230
<15-28,BECKETT>我们要找到他
<15-28,BECKETT>We got to find him.

469
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:24,220
<15-29,CASTLE>还有15分钟
<15-29,CASTLE>15 minutes.

470
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,780
<15-29,CASTLE>-分头行动吗  -分头行动
<15-29,CASTLE>- Divide and conquer? - Divide and conquer.

471
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:28,160
<15-30,BECKETT>去找那些舞者  看她们是否认得他
<15-30,BECKETT>Okay, go to the dancers. See if they know who he is.

472
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:29,820
<15-30,BECKETT>我去操作甲板
<15-30,BECKETT>I'll go to the operations deck.

473
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:35,310
<16-1,BECKETT>不好意思  我找一下阿科斯塔
<16-1,BECKETT>Um, excuse me, I'm looking for Acosta.

474
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:37,030
<16-2,MAN>他就在下面
<16-2,MAN>He's down there.

475
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:02,200
<16-3,BECKETT>阿科斯塔  我得跟你谈谈
<16-3,BECKETT>Acosta? We need to talk.

476
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,500
<16-4,BECKETT>别动
<16-4,BECKETT>Don't move.

477
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,030
<16-4,BECKETT>你被捕了  罪名是杀害劳拉·麦登
<16-4,BECKETT>You're under arrest - for the murder of Lara Madden.

478
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:11,840
<17-1,CASTLE>他想找律师
<17-1,CASTLE>So he wants an attorney.

479
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,830
<17-2,BECKETT>公辩律师办公室正派人过来
<17-2,BECKETT>The public defender's office is sending someone over now.

480
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,240
<17-2,BECKETT>这家伙可真是劣迹斑斑
<17-2,BECKETT>Yeah, this guy is dirty as hell.

481
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,540
<17-3,ESPOSITO>他和洛斯哲塔斯贩毒集团有关联
<17-3,ESPOSITO>He's connected - to the Los Zetas drug cartel.

482
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,270
<17-4,BECKETT>看看我们在他那找到了什么
<17-4,BECKETT>Well, look what we found on him.

483
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:24,360
<17-5,CASTLE>他把他的猎物圈起来了
<17-5,CASTLE>He circled his prey.

484
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,410
<17-5,CASTLE>我是理查德·卡塞尔
<17-5,CASTLE>This is Richard Castle.

485
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:31,750
<17-6,HAYLEY>你不是一个人喽
<17-6,HAYLEY>I take it that you're not alone.

486
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:32,940
<17-7,CASTLE>当然不是
<17-7,CASTLE>No, not at all.

487
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,430
<17-8,HAYLEY>你得回来一趟看看我找到的东西
<17-8,HAYLEY>You should probably make it back here I found something.

488
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:37,610
<17-9,CASTLE>好的  待会见
<17-9,CASTLE>All right, I'll see you soon.

489
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,360
<17-9,CASTLE>对不起  各位  我先走一步
<17-9,CASTLE>Sorry, guys. Got to take off.

490
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,790
<17-10,BECKETT>里克
<17-10,BECKETT>Hey, uh, Rick?

491
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:45,300
<17-12,BECKETT>谢谢你今天帮忙
<17-12,BECKETT>Thanks for today.

492
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,250
<17-13,CASTLE>乐意效劳
<17-13,CASTLE>My pleasure.

493
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:50,680
<17-14,VIKRAM>-贝克特  你有时间吗  -有
<17-14,VIKRAM>- Hey, Beckett, you got a second? - Uh, yeah.

494
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:55,340
<17-15,BECKETT>我看了劳拉相机里剩下的录像
<17-15,BECKETT>I watched the rest of the footage from Lara's camera.

495
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:56,820
<17-16,VIKRAM>看到的东西恶心  而且违法
<17-16,VIKRAM>What I saw was disgusting and criminal,

496
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,230
<17-16,VIKRAM>但都和毒品无关
<17-16,VIKRAM>but it had nothing to do with drugs.

497
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:03,780
<18-1,VIKRAM>她录下了
<18-1,VIKRAM>She was filming

498
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:07,470
<18-1,VIKRAM>邮轮船员非法向海里倾倒垃圾
<18-1,VIKRAM>cruise-shipworkers illegally dumping trash out at sea.

499
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,200
<18-2,BECKETT>这才是她上操作甲板的原因
<18-2,BECKETT>So that's why she was on the operations deck of the ship.

500
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,350
<18-2,BECKETT>她在制作一部纪录片
<18-2,BECKETT>She was making a documentary film.

501
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:14,360
<18-3,VIKRAM>这可怜的女孩想一个人做绿色和平组织
<18-3,VIKRAM>Poor thing was trying to be a one-woman greenpeace.

502
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,700
<18-4,BECKETT>但她肯定偶然发现了通过船上垃圾
<18-4,BECKETT>But she must have stumbled on a drug-smuggling conspiracy

503
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,110
<18-4,BECKETT>运输海洛因的毒品走私阴谋
<18-4,BECKETT>moving heroin through the cruise line's trash.

504
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:20,200
<18-4,BECKETT>简直太聪明了
<18-4,BECKETT>That's brilliant!

505
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,660
<18-4,BECKETT>没人会去查港口进进出出的垃圾
<18-4,BECKETT>Nobody looks into the trash moving in and out of ports.

506
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:25,040
<18-5,VIKRAM>所以我们现在要做的  就是通过传输途径
<18-5,VIKRAM>So all we got to do now is trace the pipeline

507
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,980
<18-5,VIKRAM>追回到那个中情局的神秘人
<18-5,VIKRAM>back to our mystery man inside the CIA.

508
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,770
<18-6,BECKETT>好的  就从找出跟标志游轮公司
<18-6,BECKETT>Okay, start by finding the trash-management company

509
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:33,110
<18-6,BECKETT>签订合同的垃圾管理公司开始
<18-6,BECKETT>contracted with Iconic cruise lines.

510
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,800
<18-6,BECKETT>他们肯定参与了
<18-6,BECKETT>Clearly, they're a part of this.

511
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:35,820
<18-6,BECKETT>与此同时
<18-6,BECKETT>In the meantime,

512
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:38,750
<18-6,BECKETT>我去查查阿科斯塔是在给谁做事
<18-6,BECKETT>I'm gonna try to figure out who Acosta's working for.

513
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:40,880
<18-6,BECKETT>贝克特警监
<18-6,BECKETT>Captain Beckett,

514
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:43,420
<18-7,ESPOSITO>萨尔瓦多·阿科斯塔的公辩律师想找你谈谈
<18-7,ESPOSITO>Salvador Acosta's public defender wants to have a word.

515
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,600
<18-8,BECKETT>当然  请进
<18-8,BECKETT>Uh, sure. Yeah, come on in.

516
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:48,790
<18-9,CALEB BROWN>贝克特警监  我是卡莱布·布朗
<18-9,CALEB BROWN>Hi, Captain Beckett. Caleb Brown.

517
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:49,980
<18-10,BECKETT>你好  请坐
<18-10,BECKETT>Hi. Please sit down.

518
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,530
<18-11,VIKRAM>我去查之前那条线索了
<18-11,VIKRAM>I'm gonna go work on the old core.

519
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,510
<18-12,BECKETT>好的
<18-12,BECKETT>Okay.

520
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:56,870
<18-13,BROWN>尽管我反对  阿科斯塔先生想做笔交易
<18-13,BROWN>So, against my advice, Mr. Acosta wants to make a deal.

521
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:58,460
<18-13,BROWN>他会接受二级谋杀的罪名
<18-13,BROWN>He'll cop to second-degree murder

522
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:01,210
<18-13,BROWN>如果你能够为他提出减刑的话
<18-13,BROWN>if you will recommend a reduced sentence.

523
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,630
<18-14,BECKETT>二级谋杀罪  是吗
<18-14,BECKETT>Second-degree murder, really?

524
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,980
<18-14,BECKETT>为此他得给我们一些东西
<18-14,BECKETT>He's gonna have to give us something for that.

525
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,130
<18-15,BROWN>好吧  比如说
<18-15,BROWN>Okay, like what?

526
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:12,110
<18-16,BECKETT>比如他为谁做事那些海洛因从何而来
<18-16,BECKETT>Like who he's working for and where the heroin came from.

527
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:17,170
<18-17,BROWN>什么海洛因
<18-17,BROWN>What -- what heroin?

528
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:18,990
<18-18,BECKETT>律师  我们有录像
<18-18,BECKETT>Counselor, we have - video footage

529
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:22,900
<18-18,BECKETT>录下了你的委托人走私数公斤高纯海洛因
<18-18,BECKETT>of your client smuggling kilos of uncut heroin.

530
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,590
<18-19,BROWN>警监  我的委托人坚称
<18-19,BROWN>Captain, my client insists

531
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:28,300
<18-19,BROWN>那些只是坏了的面粉
<18-19,BROWN>that those were merely bags of spoiled flour,

532
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:31,280
<18-19,BROWN>所以除非你有物证证明
<18-19,BROWN>So unless you can produce any physical evidence,

533
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,540
<18-19,BROWN>否则你也没法立案  所以
<18-19,BROWN>you don't really have a case, so...

534
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:38,130
<18-20,BROWN>好吧  这样
<18-20,BROWN>Okay, okay.

535
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,550
<18-20,BROWN>二级谋杀
<18-20,BROWN>Second-degree murder,

536
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:42,310
<18-20,BROWN>不减刑
<18-20,BROWN>no recommendation for a reduced sentence.

537
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:45,230
<18-20,BROWN>接受这个条件吧  警监
<18-20,BROWN>Take the win, Captain.

538
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:49,410
<18-20,BROWN>接受吧  因为我们并不真想上庭
<18-20,BROWN>Take it, 'cause we don't -- we don't want to go to trial.

539
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:51,880
<19-1,ESPOSITO>我来猜猜  他想要做交易是吗
<19-1,ESPOSITO>Ha, let me guess -- he offered you a deal?

540
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,630
<19-2,BECKETT>是的  我跟他说我得再考虑一下
<19-2,BECKETT>Yeah. I told him I had to think about it.

541
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:57,480
<19-3,ESPOSITO>阿科斯塔不可能是单干
<19-3,ESPOSITO>Well, there's no way Acosta was acting alone.

542
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,920
<19-3,ESPOSITO>一个贩毒集团不可能会让那样一个家伙
<19-3,ESPOSITO>No way a cartel would leave a guy like that

543
00:22:58,930 --> 00:22:59,950
<19-3,ESPOSITO>单独负责那么多的货
<19-3,ESPOSITO>in charge of that much inventory.

544
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:01,660
<19-4,RYAN>我们现在终于有证据可以证明
<19-4,RYAN>Now we finally have the evidence to prove it.

545
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:04,380
<19-4,RYAN>鉴证组终于分析出你在犯罪现场
<19-4,RYAN>CSU finally analyzed that blood residue

546
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,600
<19-4,RYAN>拍下的血迹  看一下
<19-4,RYAN>from the photograph you took at the crime scene -- check it out.

547
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,170
<19-4,RYAN>在卡塞尔鞋子旁有两组不同的脚印
<19-4,RYAN>There's two different kinds of footprints next to Castle's shoe.

548
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:11,550
<19-4,RYAN>阿科斯塔在船上肯定有搭档
<19-4,RYAN>Acosta definitely had a partner aboard that ship.

549
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:14,180
<19-5,BECKETT>我们得找出确凿证据让阿科斯塔招供
<19-5,BECKETT>We need to find something solid to make Acosta roll.

550
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,360
<19-6,RYAN>我有他的的电话记录
<19-6,RYAN>You know, I have his cell records.

551
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,840
<19-6,RYAN>他给一个临时号码打了很多电话
<19-6,RYAN>There was a flurry of phone calls to a burner cell

552
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,990
<19-6,RYAN>就在杀人之前
<19-6,RYAN>right before the murder.

553
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,880
<19-6,RYAN>阿科斯塔可能是在跟他在船上的搭档进行协调
<19-6,RYAN>Acosta could have been coordinating with his partner on board the ship.

554
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,150
<19-7,ESPOSITO>我会跟手机服务商联系
<19-7,ESPOSITO>I'll get in touch with the cell provider,

555
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:26,180
<19-7,ESPOSITO>看我们能否找到那个手机的信号以便定位
<19-7,ESPOSITO>see if we can ping that burner phone so we can locate it.

556
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,640
<19-8,BECKETT>仔细剖析阿科斯塔的生活
<19-8,BECKETT>And take apart Acosta's life.

557
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,060
<19-8,BECKETT>我们查一下已知同伙
<19-8,BECKETT>Let's check known associates --

558
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:31,420
<19-8,BECKETT>任何能够帮我们找出他搭档的线索
<19-8,BECKETT>Anything that will point us to who his partner was.

559
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:34,720
<20-1,HAYLEY>我查到了是谁给凯特昨晚发的神秘短信
<20-1,HAYLEY>I found out who sent Kate that mystery text last night.

560
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,040
<20-1,HAYLEY>是维克拉姆
<20-1,HAYLEY>It was vikram.

561
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,860
<20-2,CASTLE>等等  维克拉姆  我们认识的维克拉姆吗
<20-2,CASTLE>Wait, Vikram? Our Vikram?

562
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:39,760
<20-3,HAYLEY>是的
<20-3,HAYLEY>Oh, yes.

563
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,080
<20-4,CASTLE>这是什么
<20-4,CASTLE>Well, what's this?

564
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,690
<20-5,HAYLEY>这是凯特和维克拉姆的手机之间
<20-5,HAYLEY>Oh, it's a secret messaging program

565
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:46,160
<20-5,HAYLEY>一个秘密的短信程序
<20-5,HAYLEY>between Kate and Vikram's cellphones.

566
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:47,820
<20-5,HAYLEY>通过代理服务器
<20-5,HAYLEY>It routes through proxy servers

567
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,640
<20-5,HAYLEY>发送到一个加密中央服务器
<20-5,HAYLEY>into an encrypted central server --

568
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,380
<20-5,HAYLEY>最先进的间谍工具
<20-5,HAYLEY>State-of-the-art spycraft.

569
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:53,810
<20-6,CASTLE>但为什么呢  他们在做什么
<20-6,CASTLE>But why? What are they up to?

570
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,490
<20-7,MARTHA>我想问问你俩相同的问题
<20-7,MARTHA>I could ask the same thing of the two of you.

571
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,220
<20-7,MARTHA>理查德  怎么了
<20-7,MARTHA>Richard, what's going on?

572
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,610
<20-8,CASTLE>没什么
<20-8,CASTLE>Nothing.

573
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:04,350
<20-9,MARTHA>我跟你说过如果你做的事不能告诉你妈
<20-9,MARTHA>I told you, if you can't tell your mother what you're doing,

574
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:06,110
<20-9,MARTHA>这事你就不应该做
<20-9,MARTHA>you should not be doing it.

575
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:07,990
<20-10,CASTLE>是的  那是我八岁的时候
<20-10,CASTLE>Yes, when I was 8.

576
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,440
<20-11,MARTHA>就是
<20-11,MARTHA>Well, exactly.

577
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,940
<20-11,MARTHA>你现在应该更清楚这个道理
<20-11,MARTHA>And you should know better by now.

578
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:12,460
<20-12,CASTLE>我妻子有麻烦
<20-12,CASTLE>My wife is in trouble.

579
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:14,170
<20-12,CASTLE>我得知道到底是怎么回事
<20-12,CASTLE>I have to know what's going on.

580
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:16,140
<20-12,CASTLE>我得帮助她  我得保护她
<20-12,CASTLE>I have to help her. I have to protect her.

581
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:18,080
<20-13,MARTHA>不对  你得相信她
<20-13,MARTHA>No, you have to trust her.

582
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,050
<20-14,CASTLE>但事情终于有了眉目
<20-14,CASTLE>But it's finally starting to make sense.

583
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:20,910
<20-14,CASTLE>你难道不明白吗  妈妈
<20-14,CASTLE>Don't you see, mother?

584
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:22,100
<20-14,CASTLE>就在艾莉森·海德死后
<20-14,CASTLE>Beckett broke up with me

585
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,800
<20-14,CASTLE>贝克特跟我分了手
<20-14,CASTLE>right after Allison Hyde's death.

586
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:27,450
<20-14,CASTLE>也就是那时她和维克拉姆成了搭档
<20-14,CASTLE>That's also when she partnered with Vikram.

587
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:28,710
<20-15,HAYLEY>所以我们就得问问自己
<20-15,HAYLEY>So we have to ask ourselves,

588
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:30,770
<20-15,HAYLEY>万一艾莉森·海德不是自杀呢
<20-15,HAYLEY>what if Allison Hyde didn't kill herself?

589
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,200
<20-15,HAYLEY>万一她是被人谋杀的呢
<20-15,HAYLEY>What if she was murdered?

590
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:33,590
<20-15,HAYLEY>就是
<20-15,HAYLEY>Yes.

591
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:36,010
<20-16,CASTLE>凶手跟杀掉布莱肯参议员
<20-16,CASTLE>By the same people who murdered Senator Bracken

592
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:38,470
<20-16,CASTLE>及贝克特在总检察长办公室队友的是同一人
<20-16,CASTLE>and Beckett's former team at the A.G.

593
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:40,610
<20-17,HAYLEY>维克拉姆之前就在总检察长办公室工作
<20-17,HAYLEY>And of course Vikram used to work at the A.G.'s office.

594
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:41,840
<20-17,HAYLEY>万一是凯特把他找来
<20-17,HAYLEY>What if Kate brought him in

595
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,370
<20-17,HAYLEY>是让他偷偷帮她调查这些谋杀案
<20-17,HAYLEY>to secretly help her investigate those murders?

596
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:45,910
<20-18,CASTLE>你能破解维克拉姆的防火墙吗
<20-18,CASTLE>Can you hack Vikram's firewall?

597
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:47,390
<20-19,HAYLEY>当然  但需要点时间
<20-19,HAYLEY>Sure. It'll take a while.

598
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:48,360
<20-19,HAYLEY>理查德
<20-19,HAYLEY>Richard...

599
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,120
<20-20,MARTHA>听着  不管凯萨琳在做什么  为什么这么做
<20-20,MARTHA>Look, regardless of what Katherine is doing and why,

600
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,510
<20-20,MARTHA>你确定你想这样做吗
<20-20,MARTHA>are you sure that you want to do this?

601
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,630
<20-20,MARTHA>因为如果她发现你在暗中监视
<20-20,MARTHA>Because if she finds out that you are spying,

602
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:02,150
<20-20,MARTHA>你可能就已经跨过了不能反悔的界限
<20-20,MARTHA>You may just have crossed a line you cannot uncross.

603
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:04,870
<20-21,CASTLE>她可能会害死自己
<20-21,CASTLE>She may just get herself killed.

604
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:06,270
<20-21,CASTLE>她逼得我别无选择
<20-21,CASTLE>She's left me no other choice.

605
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,960
<20-22,MARTHA>总是有其他选择的
<20-22,MARTHA>There's always another choice.

606
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:11,110
<20-23,HAYLEY>这事要怎么办  瑞克
<20-23,HAYLEY>So, what's it gonna be, Rick?

607
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:14,540
<20-24,CASTLE>我必须知道真相  无论有什么后果
<20-24,CASTLE>I have to know. No matter the consequence.

608
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,510
<20-24,CASTLE>做吧
<20-24,CASTLE>Do it.

609
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,630
<21-1,RYAN>阿科斯塔在凶杀案发生当晚
<21-1,RYAN>Hey, you know that burner cell

610
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,370
<21-1,RYAN>拨打的那个一次性电话
<21-1,RYAN>that Acosta called the night of the murder?

611
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:23,780
<21-1,RYAN>它刚通过一个信号塔发出了信号
<21-1,RYAN>It just pinged off a cell tower

612
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:25,650
<21-1,RYAN>位置在东哈莱姆125街和莱辛顿大道附近
<21-1,RYAN>at 125th and Lex in east Harlem.

613
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:27,160
<21-1,RYAN>阿科斯塔的同伙就在城里
<21-1,RYAN>Acosta's partner is in the city.

614
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,270
<21-2,ESPOSITO>那怎么把他找出来
<21-2,ESPOSITO>Now, how to find him?

615
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:29,950
<21-2,ESPOSITO>他可能在信号塔方圆几英里内
<21-2,ESPOSITO>He could be anywhere within a couple-mile radius

616
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:30,830
<21-2,ESPOSITO>的任何地方
<21-2,ESPOSITO>from that cell tower.

617
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:32,520
<21-3,RYAN>我们得深挖阿科斯塔的生活
<21-3,RYAN>We need to dig into Acosta's life,

618
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:34,790
<21-3,RYAN>看看他跟那个区域之前有没有交集
<21-3,RYAN>see if he had any connections to that part of town.

619
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:36,160
<21-4,ESPOSITO>我告诉贝克特一声
<21-4,ESPOSITO>I'll give Beckett the heads-up.

620
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:43,550
<22-1,VIKRAM>承包那条航线的垃圾清运公司
<22-1,VIKRAM>The trash company that contracts with the cruise line

621
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:46,090
<22-1,VIKRAM>名叫汤加群岛环卫公司
<22-1,VIKRAM>is called Friendly Islands Sanitation.

622
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,200
<22-1,VIKRAM>他们在拉美  加勒比地区和北非
<22-1,VIKRAM>They have satellites in Latin America, Caribbean,

623
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,220
<22-1,VIKRAM>都有分公司
<22-1,VIKRAM>and North Africa.

624
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:51,970
<22-2,BECKETT>都是全球毒品交易的重点地区
<22-2,BECKETT>Oh, key points in the worldwide drug trade.

625
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:54,430
<22-2,BECKETT>一定是垃圾清运公司内部的什么人
<22-2,BECKETT>So, somebody inside of the trash company

626
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:55,900
<22-2,BECKETT>跟洛克塞特达成了一笔交易
<22-2,BECKETT>must have cut a deal with Loksat

627
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,400
<22-2,BECKETT>通过那道航线运送毒品
<22-2,BECKETT>to move drugs through the cruise line.

628
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,510
<22-3,VIKRAM>那艘船在纽约一靠岸  劳拉拍到的海洛因
<22-3,VIKRAM>The heroin shipment Lara videotaped was offloaded with the trash

629
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:02,860
<22-3,VIKRAM>就跟着垃圾下船了  现在可能在任何地方
<22-3,VIKRAM>the minute the ship docked in new york -- it could be anywhere by now.

630
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,550
<22-4,BECKETT>我们得跟着那些垃圾  看看它们都去了哪
<22-4,BECKETT>Okay, we got to follow the garbage, see where it went.

631
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:05,410
<22-5,VIKRAM>这就办
<22-5,VIKRAM>On it.

632
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,320
<22-6,BECKETT>是卡塞尔打来的
<22-6,BECKETT>It's Castle.

633
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:08,370
<22-7,VIKRAM>不要接
<22-7,VIKRAM>Don't answer it.

634
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:13,650
<22-8,BECKETT>瑞克  什么事
<22-8,BECKETT>Hey, Rick. What's up?

635
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:15,070
<22-8,BECKETT>你决定要买那艘船了吗
<22-8,BECKETT>You decided to buy that boat?

636
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:17,280
<23-1,CASTLE>某人听起来心情不错啊
<23-1,CASTLE>Well, someone's in a good mood.

637
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,850
<23-1,CASTLE>你是在想我们裸裎相对的时光吗
<23-1,CASTLE>You thinking about our naked time?

638
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,640
<23-2,BECKETT>呃  没有
<23-2,BECKETT>Um...no.

639
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:23,990
<23-3,CASTLE>我在想
<23-3,CASTLE>Well, I am -- I haven't

640
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:25,610
<23-3,CASTLE>事实上  我就没停下来过
<23-3,CASTLE>stopped thinking about it, as a matter of fact.

642
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:29,590
<23-3,CASTLE>我们今晚再来一轮怎么样  在我那儿
<23-3,CASTLE>Um, tell you what, how about round two, tonight, my place?

643
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:30,610
<23-3,CASTLE>别人都不会知道
<23-3,CASTLE>No one has to know.

644
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,050
<23-4,BECKETT>我不能去  我今晚得工作
<23-4,BECKETT>Yeah, I can't. I have to work tonight.

645
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:35,950
<23-5,CASTLE>我还以为当了警监
<23-5,CASTLE>Um, well, I thought being a captain

646
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:37,260
<23-5,CASTLE>你就可以把工作指派给别人了
<23-5,CASTLE>meant you could delegate.

647
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,850
<23-6,BECKETT>实际上我还是有些事需要自己做的
<23-6,BECKETT>You know what? I actually have to do a few things myself.

648
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:41,730
<23-7,CASTLE>说不定我能帮你  你在忙什么
<23-7,CASTLE>Well, maybe I can help. What are you working on?

649
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:45,440
<23-8,BECKETT>警监的工作
<23-8,BECKETT>Um, captain stuff?

650
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:47,700
<23-8,BECKETT>那个就
<23-8,BECKETT>Well, that...

652
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:51,040
<23-9,CASTLE>那祝愿你的警监工作一切顺利  拜拜
<23-9,CASTLE>Then good luck with your captain stuff. Bye.

653
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:52,640
<23-10,BECKETT>喂
<23-10,BECKETT>Hello?

654
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,510
<23-11,HAYLEY>我们成功了
<23-11,HAYLEY>Yep. We got it.

655
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:59,710
<23-11,HAYLEY>她的手机信号就是我们穿过
<23-11,HAYLEY>Her cell signal was our trojan horse

656
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:01,250
<23-11,HAYLEY>维克拉姆第一道防火墙的木马
<23-11,HAYLEY>through Vikram's first firewall.

657
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,950
<23-11,HAYLEY>现在我就能一次黑进一台服务器
<23-11,HAYLEY>Now I can hack one server at a time

658
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:05,940
<23-11,HAYLEY>直到我找到他的核心服务器
<23-11,HAYLEY>until I find his central server.

659
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:09,560
<23-12,HAYLEY>后悔了
<23-12,HAYLEY>Second thoughts?

660
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:11,340
<23-13,CASTLE>悔了好几次了
<23-13,CASTLE>Second, third, fourth.

661
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,930
<23-13,CASTLE>不了  我们  我们继续吧
<23-13,CASTLE>No. Let's -- let's keep going.

663
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:22,710
<24-1,VIKRAM>还好吗
<24-1,VIKRAM>Everything all right?

664
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:25,490
<24-2,BECKETT>挺好的  不过他有点怪怪的
<24-2,BECKETT>Yeah, I mean, he was just a little weird.

665
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:27,300
<24-3,VIKRAM>他通常都很怪
<24-3,VIKRAM>Well, normally he's a lot weird, so...

666
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,710
<24-3,VIKRAM>是迷人的怪
<24-3,VIKRAM>In a charming kind of way.

667
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:31,010
<24-5,VIKRAM>看看这个
<24-5,VIKRAM>Oh. - check this out.

668
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:32,000
<24-5,VIKRAM>三个垃圾车
<24-5,VIKRAM>Three dump trucks

669
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,060
<24-5,VIKRAM>今天早晨从我们那艘邮轮上卸下了垃圾
<24-5,VIKRAM>offloaded trash from our cruise ship this morning.

670
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,550
<24-5,VIKRAM>三个都是早晨8:05分出发的
<24-5,VIKRAM>All three left at 8:05 A.M.,

671
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:37,520
<24-5,VIKRAM>但只有两辆车载9:17分出现在垃圾场
<24-5,VIKRAM>but only two showed up at the dump at 9:17.

672
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,670
<24-6,BECKETT>所以第三辆车一定装着海洛因
<24-6,BECKETT>So the third one must have been carrying the heroin,

673
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:42,330
<24-6,BECKETT>送完货它才停回去
<24-6,BECKETT>and then it stopped after it made the delivery.

674
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:44,140
<24-6,BECKETT>但是送到了哪呢
<24-6,BECKETT>But where?

675
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:46,360
<24-7,VIKRAM>我一直在查交通摄像头录像
<24-7,VIKRAM>I've been scrubbing traffic-cam footage,

676
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:48,700
<24-7,VIKRAM>但我在华盛顿高地跟丢了那辆垃圾车
<24-7,VIKRAM>but I lost the truck in Washington Heights.

677
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,250
<24-8,BECKETT>尽可能找到关于那个卡车司机的一切资料
<24-8,BECKETT>Pull everything we can on the truck driver.

678
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:51,900
<24-9,COMPUTER>警报  系统攻击
<24-9,COMPUTER>Alert -- system breach.

680
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:54,520
<24-10,VIKRAM>-我们有麻烦了  -什么
<24-10,VIKRAM>- Oh, we got a problem. - What?

681
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:57,040
<24-11,BECKETT>有人在我的一个服务器里安插了一个木马
<24-11,BECKETT>Someone synched a rat to one of my servers.

682
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,520
<24-12,VIKRAM>一个远程控制工具
<24-12,VIKRAM>A remote access tool --

683
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,510
<24-12,VIKRAM>我们正在被黑客攻击
<24-12,VIKRAM>we're being hacked.

684
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:02,170
<24-13,BECKETT>-是洛克塞特干的吗  -我不知道
<24-13,BECKETT>- By Loksat? - I don't know.

685
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,830
<24-15,BECKETT>但我们一直很小心  他们是怎么找到我们的
<24-15,BECKETT>But we've been so careful. How could they find us?

686
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:05,880
<24-16,VIKRAM>他们还没找到我们
<24-16,VIKRAM>They haven't found us yet,

687
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,460
<24-16,VIKRAM>只是击破了我们系统的外层
<24-16,VIKRAM>just cracked the outer layer of our system.

688
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:10,490
<24-16,VIKRAM>我要启动一个入侵检测程序
<24-16,VIKRAM>I'll start an intrusion inspection

689
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,710
<24-16,VIKRAM>看看是谁干的
<24-16,VIKRAM>and find out who our rat is.

691
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,390
<25-2,CASTLE>-怎么了  -他们在查我们
<25-2,CASTLE>- What? - They're onto us.

692
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:22,310
<25-3,HAYLEY>维克拉姆正在试着追踪我们的IP地址
<25-3,HAYLEY>Vikram's trying to track our I.P. Address.

693
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,310
<25-4,CASTLE>你能阻止他吗
<25-4,CASTLE>Can you stop him?

694
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,060
<25-4,CASTLE>不能
<25-4,CASTLE>No.

695
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:25,970
<25-5,HAYLEY>但我拖慢他
<25-5,HAYLEY>But I can slow him down.

696
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:27,770
<26-1,VIKRAM>攻击就是从城里某处发出的
<26-1,VIKRAM>It's coming from inside the city.

697
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:29,070
<26-1,VIKRAM>正在缩小范围
<26-1,VIKRAM>Trying to narrow it down.

698
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:45,840
<27-1,BECKETT>这是什么乱七八糟的
<27-1,BECKETT>What the hell?

699
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:54,220
<27-2,VIKRAM>你很厉害  但是我更厉害
<27-2,VIKRAM>Oh, you are good, but I am better.

700
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:59,040
<27-2,VIKRAM>猫咪视频  可不像洛克塞特做的事
<27-2,VIKRAM>Cat videos? That doesn't seem like Loksat.

701
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:00,580
<27-3,BECKETT>谁会做这种事
<27-3,BECKETT>Who would do that?

702
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:02,110
<27-4,VIKRAM>我们就快找到答案了
<27-4,VIKRAM>We're about to find out.

703
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:03,480
<27-4,VIKRAM>那个很难拖住他
<27-4,VIKRAM>That barely slowed him down.

704
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,030
<28-1,HAYLEY>我很抱歉  但他一分钟之内就会找到我们
<28-1,HAYLEY>I'm sorry, but he's gonna find us in less than a minute.

705
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:06,050
<28-1,HAYLEY>要放弃吗
<28-1,HAYLEY>Should we abort?

706
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:08,780
<28-2,CASTLE>不  我们  我们就剩两个小亮盒子没进了
<28-2,CASTLE>No. We -- we've only got two of the blinky boxes left to go.

707
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:11,080
<28-2,CASTLE>-小亮盒子  -黑进去黑进去
<28-2,CASTLE>- Blinky boxes? - Just hack, hack.

709
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,510
<28-2,CASTLE>加油
<28-2,CASTLE>Come on.

710
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,580
<29-1,VIKRAM>找到了
<29-1,VIKRAM>Got it.

712
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:19,780
<29-2,BECKETT>那是卡塞尔的办公室
<29-2,BECKETT>That's castle's office.

713
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:21,220
<29-2,BECKETT>他一定是在和海莉合作
<29-2,BECKETT>He must be working with Hayley.

714
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:22,540
<29-3,VIKRAM>她有技术能做到这一切
<29-3,VIKRAM>She's got the skill set for this,

715
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:24,840
<29-3,VIKRAM>她马上就要攻破我们的防火墙了
<29-3,VIKRAM>and she is about to breach our firewall.

716
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,750
<29-3,VIKRAM>如果她做到了  他们将立刻能拿到
<29-3,VIKRAM>If she does, - they'll have instant access

717
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:28,080
<29-3,VIKRAM>我们全部的调查资料
<29-3,VIKRAM>to our entire investigation.

718
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,120
<29-4,BECKETT>不不不  那会让卡塞尔成为目标
<29-4,BECKETT>No, no, no, no, that's gonna put a target on castle's back.

719
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,110
<29-4,BECKETT>我们得阻止他
<29-4,BECKETT>We have to stop him.

720
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:32,490
<29-5,VIKRAM>我能阻止他  但我需要时间
<29-5,VIKRAM>I can do it, but I need time.

721
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:35,090
<29-6,BECKETT>我看看能不能帮你争取一些时间
<29-6,BECKETT>Let me see if I can buy you some.

722
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,630
<30-1,CASTLE>是贝克特来电话
<30-1,CASTLE>It's Beckett calling.

723
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,580
<30-1,CASTLE>是贝克特  她在给我打电话  我怎么办
<30-1,CASTLE>That's beckett. She's calling. What do I do?

724
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,750
<30-2,HAYLEY>接电话  看看她知道了多少
<30-2,HAYLEY>Answer it. - let's see how much she knows.

725
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,430
<30-4,BECKETT>宝贝
<30-4,BECKETT>Hey, babe.

726
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:44,500
<30-5,CASTLE>对今晚的安排改主意了
<30-5,CASTLE>Change your mind about tonight?

727
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,030
<30-6,BECKETT>今晚还是不行
<30-6,BECKETT>Tonight's still not gonna work.

728
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:48,560
<30-6,BECKETT>但现在怎么样
<30-6,BECKETT>But what about right now?

729
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,130
<30-6,BECKETT>去你办公室起水雾吧
<30-6,BECKETT>Feel like steaming up your office?

730
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:54,250
<30-7,CASTLE>我办公室  听起来棒极了
<30-7,CASTLE>My office? That sounds great.

731
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,440
<30-7,CASTLE>我正在
<30-7,CASTLE>I'm, uh...

733
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:58,660
<30-7,CASTLE>现在正在办一些事情
<30-7,CASTLE>Sort of in the middle of something right now.

734
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:01,570
<30-8,BECKETT>是吗  那真不巧  因为我就在楼下呢
<30-8,BECKETT>Really? That's too bad, 'cause I'm right downstairs.

735
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:03,750
<30-9,CASTLE>是楼下  真的楼下是吧
<30-9,CASTLE>Downstairs downstairs?

00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:05,870
<30-10,BECKETT>是啊  我10秒钟就能上楼
<30-10,BECKETT>Yeah. I can be up in 10 seconds.

737
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:08,500
<30-11,CASTLE>10秒可真不长啊
<30-11,CASTLE>10 seconds is not long at all.

738
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,920
<30-11,CASTLE>等  等  等一下
<30-11,CASTLE>Hang -- hang -- hang on one second.

739
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:10,970
<30-11,CASTLE>我们得关掉它
<30-11,CASTLE>We've got to shut it down.

740
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:12,210
<30-11,CASTLE>她就快要进门了
<30-11,CASTLE>She's gonna walk in the front door.

741
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,000
<30-11,CASTLE>不  她在说谎
<30-11,CASTLE>No. She's lying.

742
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:15,100
<30-12,HAYLEY>她的电话信号在皇后区呢
<30-12,HAYLEY>Her phone is pinging from Queens.

744
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,730
<30-13,CASTLE>她知道是我们在攻击他们
<30-13,CASTLE>She knows it's us who's hacking her.

745
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:22,990
<30-13,CASTLE>刚刚抱歉啦  我正在脱裤子
<30-13,CASTLE>Sorry about that. Just taking off my pants.

00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:23,810
<30-13,CASTLE>你上来吗
<30-13,CASTLE>You coming up?

747
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,160
<31-1,BECKETT>他知道我在说谎
<31-1,BECKETT>He knows I'm lying.

748
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:29,800
<31-2,BECKETT>你知道吗
<31-2,BECKETT>You know what?

749
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:31,620
<31-2,BECKETT>刚刚发生了点事情
<31-2,BECKETT>Something just came up.

750
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:32,850
<31-2,BECKETT>下回再说
<31-2,BECKETT>Rain check?

751
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:35,150
<31-3,CASTLE>没问题  你知道上哪找我
<31-3,CASTLE>Sure. You know where to find me.

753
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:44,850
<31-3,CASTLE>她就快攻进来了
<31-3,CASTLE>She's almost in.

754
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,220
<32-1,VIKRAM>我可以发出一个网络炸弹
<32-1,VIKRAM>I could launch a cyber nuke,

755
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,970
<32-1,VIKRAM>但它会完全摧毁他的系统
<32-1,VIKRAM>but it will completely fry his system.

756
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,270
<32-2,BECKETT>他在家里放了一个备用系统
<32-2,BECKETT>He's got a back-up system at home.

757
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:53,460
<32-3,VIKRAM>所以确定要放炸弹吗
<32-3,VIKRAM>Is that a go for launch?

758
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:55,510
<32-4,BECKETT>是的
<32-4,BECKETT>Yes.

759
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,540
<33-1,HAYLEY>不不不不不
<33-1,HAYLEY>No, no, no, no! Oh!

760
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:03,280
<33-2,CASTLE>刚刚发生了什么
<33-2,CASTLE>What just happened?

761
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:05,180
<33-3,HAYLEY>恐怕这是终极毁灭了
<33-3,HAYLEY>Armageddon, I'm afraid.

762
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:06,870
<33-3,HAYLEY>维克拉姆刚刚炸掉了我们整个系统
<33-3,HAYLEY>Vikram just nuked the whole system.

763
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:07,840
<33-3,HAYLEY>我们失去了一切
<33-3,HAYLEY>We've lost everything.

764
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:08,870
<33-3,HAYLEY>我们失去了
<33-3,HAYLEY>We've l--

765
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:13,980
<33-5,CASTLE>我从来就不喜欢那家伙
<33-5,CASTLE>I never liked that guy.

766
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:15,500
<34-1,BECKETT>他们进去了吗
<34-1,BECKETT>Did they get in?

767
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,810
<34-2,VIKRAM>没有  再晚一秒他们就进去了
<34-2,VIKRAM>No. Another second and they would have.

768
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,710
<34-2,VIKRAM>谢天谢地我们的地址和文件都很安全
<34-2,VIKRAM>Thankfully, our location and all our files are still safe.

769
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:21,820
<34-3,BECKETT>只是暂时安全
<34-3,BECKETT>Yeah, for now.

770
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:24,010
<34-3,BECKETT>我只希望我刚才没炸毁了我的婚姻
<34-3,BECKETT>I just hope I didn't nuke my marriage.

771
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:30,920
<34-3,BECKETT>你去哪
<34-3,BECKETT>Where you going?

772
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,100
<35-1,VIKRAM>我得跟卡塞尔谈谈
<35-1,VIKRAM>I need to talk to Castle.

773
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,130
<35-2,BECKETT>不  你得等等再谈
<35-2,BECKETT>No, that'll have to wait.

774
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:35,380
<35-3,VIKRAM>我找到了汤加群岛环卫公司那个垃圾车司机
<35-3,VIKRAM>I found the garbage-truck driver from Friendly Islands.

775
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:36,890
<35-3,VIKRAM>他还有30分钟就下班了
<35-3,VIKRAM>His shift ends in 30 minutes.

776
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:38,160
<35-3,VIKRAM>现在新闻上都是劳拉的凶杀案
<35-3,VIKRAM>With Lara's murder all over the news,

777
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,110
<35-3,VIKRAM>他们可能会加强防卫  我们现在就得找到他
<35-3,VIKRAM>they might be circling their wagons -- we got to get to him now.

778
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:41,140
<35-4,BECKETT>不  我讨厌向他说谎
<35-4,BECKETT>No, I hate lying to him.

779
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:43,370
<35-5,VIKRAM>我明白  但你是因为正确的理由才这么做的
<35-5,VIKRAM>I know, but you're doing it for the right reasons.

780
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:46,190
<35-5,VIKRAM>这是我们第一次真正接近洛克塞特的机会
<35-5,VIKRAM>This is our first real shot to get to Loksat.

781
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:47,330
<35-5,VIKRAM>我们得抓住
<35-5,VIKRAM>We have to take it.

782
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:49,790
<35-5,VIKRAM>你说的对
<35-5,VIKRAM>You're right.

783
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,020
<35-6,BECKETT>跟我讲讲那个司机的情况
<35-6,BECKETT>Tell me about the driver.

784
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,710
<35-7,VIKRAM>他叫萨姆·麦基
<35-7,VIKRAM>His name is Sam Mackey.

785
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:05,900
<36-1,SAM MACKEY>等等  等一下
<36-1,SAM MACKEY>Wait, wait! Wait!

786
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:08,940
<36-1,SAM MACKEY>求你们不要伤害我  你们是什么人
<36-1,SAM MACKEY>Please don't hurt me! Please! Who are you?

787
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:11,150
<36-2,BECKETT>当你搞砸了一单运输的时候  我们就会出现
<36-2,BECKETT>We're the people that show when you screw up a delivery.

788
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:13,260
<36-3,SAM>不  我直接去仓库了  完全按照指示做的
<36-3,SAM>No, I took it straight to the warehouse, just like I was told.

789
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,360
<36-4,VIKRAM>别骗我们  我们都看见了
<36-4,VIKRAM>Don't lie to us. We were watching.

790
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:16,080
<36-4,VIKRAM>-你并没按照指示来做  -不  我做了
<36-4,VIKRAM>- You didn't follow instructions. - Yes, I did.

791
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,490
<36-5,SAM>我直接去了布朗克斯区的那个地方
<36-5,SAM>I went straight to the place in the Bronx

792
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:18,410
<36-5,SAM>经过三号大道桥
<36-5,SAM>by the 3rd Avenue Bridge,

793
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:19,980
<36-5,SAM>按照巴拿马那个人说得一样
<36-5,SAM>just like the guy from Panama said!

794
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,060
<36-6,BECKETT>你看见什么了吗
<36-6,BECKETT>Did you see anything?

795
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:22,760
<36-6,BECKETT>没有
<36-6,BECKETT>No.

796
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:24,680
<36-7,SAM>他让我待在卡车里  我照做了
<36-7,SAM>I stayed in the truck like I was told.

797
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,500
<36-8,VIKRAM>巴拿马那个人是谁
<36-8,VIKRAM>Who's the guy in Panama?

798
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,040
<36-9,SAM>我不知道
<36-9,SAM>I don't know.

799
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:31,900
<36-10,BECKETT>我知道你在想什么  萨姆
<36-10,BECKETT>I know what you're thinking, Sam.

800
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:34,570
<36-10,BECKETT>你认为我不会杀了你  你想得没错
<36-10,BECKETT>You're thinking I'm not gonna kill you, and you are right.

801
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:36,650
<36-10,BECKETT>但你一直在经营毒品生意
<36-10,BECKETT>But you've been running drugs,

802
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:40,610
<36-10,BECKETT>那就意味着纽约警局可以没收你的全部财产
<36-10,BECKETT>and that means the NYPD can seize everything in your life.

803
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:42,390
<36-11,VIKRAM>想让你的孩子们住在纸盒箱里吗
<36-11,VIKRAM>Want your kids to live out of a cardboard box?

804
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:43,670
<36-11,VIKRAM>你不配合  结果就会是那样
<36-11,VIKRAM>'Cause that's what's gonna happen.

805
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:45,120
<36-12,SAM>我不知道任何名字
<36-12,SAM>I don't know any names.

806
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:47,120
<36-12,SAM>他们付钱给我  不让我多问
<36-12,SAM>They pay me not to ask questions.

807
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,750
<36-12,SAM>别扯上我的家人  我...
<36-12,SAM>Don't involve my family -- I-I...

808
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,620
<36-12,SAM>我没有选择的余地
<36-12,SAM>I didn't have a choice.

809
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:51,710
<36-13,VIKRAM>我想他说得是实话
<36-13,VIKRAM>I think he's telling the truth.

810
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:54,330
<36-14,BECKETT>好吧  萨姆  接下来这样
<36-14,BECKETT>All right, Sam, here's what's gonna happen.

811
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,750
<36-14,BECKETT>我不会逮捕你
<36-14,BECKETT>I'm not gonna arrest you,

812
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:58,480
<36-14,BECKETT>但如果你接到新的货物  就打这个号码
<36-14,BECKETT>but if you get another delivery, you call this number.

813
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,460
<36-15,SAM>不  不行  我不能  他们会杀了我
<36-15,SAM>No, no, no, no. I can't. They'll kill me.

814
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:01,330
<36-16,BECKETT>他们也许会杀了你
<36-16,BECKETT>They might.

815
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:03,590
<36-16,BECKETT>但如果我逮捕你  他们绝对会杀了你
<36-16,BECKETT>But if I arrest you, they definitely will.

816
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:05,060
<36-17,VIKRAM>如果你敢把这段对话告诉他们
<36-17,VIKRAM>And telling them about this conversation

817
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:07,550
<36-17,VIKRAM>我保证你再也见不到你的家人
<36-17,VIKRAM>guarantees that your whole family will be wiped out.

818
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:10,010
<36-18,SAM>我什么也不会说的  我保证
<36-18,SAM>I won't say a word. I promise.

819
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:13,330
<36-19,BECKETT>很好  那装满海洛因的仓库到底在哪
<36-19,BECKETT>Good. Now, where exactly is the warehouse full of heroin?

820
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:20,620
<37-1,VIKRAM>我们来晚了  海洛因已经被运走了
<37-1,VIKRAM>We're too late. They already moved the heroin.

821
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:21,890
<37-2,BECKETT>而且外面没有摄像头
<37-2,BECKETT>And there's no street cams outside

822
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:23,280
<37-2,BECKETT>没法得知谁把货物运走的
<37-2,BECKETT>so we could see who picked it up.

823
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:25,910
<37-2,BECKETT>见鬼  什么线索也没有
<37-2,BECKETT>Damn it. This was for nothing.

824
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:27,390
<37-3,VIKRAM>不  我们有线索的
<37-3,VIKRAM>No, no, we do have something.

825
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:29,490
<37-3,VIKRAM>我们知道谁是汤加群岛环卫的
<37-3,VIKRAM>We find out who the main players are

826
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:31,120
<37-3,VIKRAM>主要头目了
<37-3,VIKRAM>at Friendly Islands Sanitation,

827
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:32,580
<37-3,VIKRAM>萨姆下一次运货时
<37-3,VIKRAM>and the next time Sam catches a shipment,

828
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:33,910
<15-20,BECKETT>我们会  我们会在那的
<15-20,BECKETT>we'll -- we'll be there.

829
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:35,070
<15-21,MAN>是莱恩
<15-21,MAN>It's Ryan.

830
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,840
<15-22,ACOSTA>好的  我马上就到
<15-22,ACOSTA>Okay. Yeah. I-I'll be right there.

831
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:41,310
<15-22,ACOSTA>他们似乎找到阿科斯塔的同伙了
<15-22,ACOSTA>They think they found Acosta's partner.

833
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,830
<38-1,ESPOSITO>阿科斯塔神秘同伙所用手机
<38-1,ESPOSITO>Cellphone belonging to Acosta's mystery partner

834
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:48,850
<38-1,ESPOSITO>今天早些时候在东哈林区被使用过
<38-1,ESPOSITO>was used in East Harlem earlier today.

835
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,990
<38-2,RYAN>我们彻查了阿科斯塔
<38-2,RYAN>We tore apart Acosta's life.

836
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,880
<38-2,RYAN>他过去常在那个街区的一处公寓里过夜
<38-2,RYAN>He used to crash at an apartment in that neighborhood.

837
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,530
<38-2,RYAN>房租上的名字是里奥·朗加佐
<38-2,RYAN>The name on the lease was a Leo Longarzo.

838
00:33:56,530 --> 00:33:58,050
<38-3,ESPOSITO>里奥是厄瓜多尔
<38-3,ESPOSITO>Leo is a traveling salesman

839
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:00,120
<38-3,ESPOSITO>一间进出口公司的旅行推销员
<38-3,ESPOSITO>for an Ecuadorian import/export company.

840
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,340
<38-4,BECKETT>那听起来很像贩毒集团头目的代号
<38-4,BECKETT>Well, that sounds like code for a Cartel Lieutenant.

841
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,570
<38-5,ESPOSITO>没错  他周游世界  无妻无子
<38-5,ESPOSITO>Right. He travels all over the world, no wife, no kids.

842
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:05,430
<38-6,RYAN>更像了
<38-6,RYAN>It gets better.

843
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:07,370
<38-6,RYAN>我们查了巡航的旅客名单
<38-6,RYAN>We checked the passenger manifest of the cruise.

844
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:08,640
<38-6,RYAN>朗加佐在那艘船上
<38-6,RYAN>Longarzo was on that ship.

845
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,600
<38-6,RYAN>他就是我们要找的人
<38-6,RYAN>That's our guy.

846
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,740
<38-7,BECKETT>很好  派警员到他公寓附近守着
<38-7,BECKETT>All right, send uniforms to sit on his apartment.

847
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:12,820
<38-7,BECKETT>看他是否会出现
<38-7,BECKETT>See if he turns up.

848
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:13,580
<38-8,ESPOSITO>好的
<38-8,ESPOSITO>All right.

849
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:20,900
<38-9,CASTLE>凯特  我们得谈谈
<38-9,CASTLE>Kate? We need to talk.

850
00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:29,950
<39-1,CASTLE>知道吗  当我挂上私家侦探的招牌时
<39-1,CASTLE>You know, when I hung up my shingle as a P.I.,

851
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,770
<39-1,CASTLE>还以为只会去跟踪一些妻子
<39-1,CASTLE>I knew I would have to follow some wives.

852
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:33,800
<39-1,CASTLE>从没想到会跟踪自己的妻子
<39-1,CASTLE>I just never thought it would be my own.

853
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:38,000
<39-2,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你为什么就不能相信我呢
<39-2,BECKETT>Castle, why couldn't you just trust me?

854
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:40,830
<39-3,CASTLE>你怎么能那样要求我呢
<39-3,CASTLE>How can you ask me that?

855
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:44,680
<39-3,CASTLE>昨晚我看到维克拉姆发给你的信息了
<39-3,CASTLE>I saw the text Vikram sent you last night.

856
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:46,230
<39-3,CASTLE>我以为你有麻烦了
<39-3,CASTLE>I thought you were in trouble.

857
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:49,320
<39-3,CASTLE>结果却发现你一直在欺骗我
<39-3,CASTLE>Instead, I find out you've been lying to me.

858
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,140
<39-4,BECKETT>我只是想保护你
<39-4,BECKETT>I was trying to protect you.

859
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,390
<39-5,CASTLE>躲避杀害艾莉森·海德的凶手吗
<39-5,CASTLE>From Allison Hyde's killer?

860
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:57,190
<39-5,CASTLE>是的  当我意识到你并不是想独处时
<39-5,CASTLE>Yeah, it was easy to figure out once I realized

861
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,120
<39-5,CASTLE>我很容易就查出来了
<39-5,CASTLE>you weren't just looking for "Me" time.

862
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:03,980
<39-6,BECKETT>洛克塞特认为他成功瞒过去了
<39-6,BECKETT>LokSat thinks that his cover-up worked.

863
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:06,840
<39-6,BECKETT>所以他才放过我们的
<39-6,BECKETT>That's why he let us live.

864
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:09,570
<39-6,BECKETT>如果他发现我还在追查此事
<39-6,BECKETT>And if he finds out that I am still pursuing this,

865
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:11,900
<39-6,BECKETT>他会杀了我和我身边的任何人
<39-6,BECKETT>he will kill me and anyone that I am close to.

866
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:14,870
<39-6,BECKETT>所以我必须让你离开我
<39-6,BECKETT>That's why I had to push you away.

867
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:21,470
<39-7,CASTLE>单是你有那样的想法就让我心碎
<39-7,CASTLE>The fact that you even think that breaks my heart.

868
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:24,160
<39-7,CASTLE>为了你我愿意赴汤蹈火  凯特
<39-7,CASTLE>I'd walk into a tornado for you, Kate.

869
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,560
<39-8,BECKETT>如果失去你  我会死的
<39-8,BECKETT>And I would die if I lost you.

870
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,630
<39-8,BECKETT>你想知道什么才最伤人吗
<39-8,BECKETT>You want to know what hurts the most?

871
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,820
<39-9,CASTLE>你本可以告诉我全部真相
<39-9,CASTLE>You could have come to me with everything,

872
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:35,260
<39-9,CASTLE>像你之前做得那样离开我
<39-9,CASTLE>broken us up just like you did,

873
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,520
<39-9,CASTLE>但只把那当做掩饰
<39-9,CASTLE>only it would have been a cover.

874
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:39,740
<39-9,CASTLE>而暗地里在一起  我们可以打败那个人的
<39-9,CASTLE>And together, in secret, we could have taken this guy down.

875
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:42,760
<39-9,CASTLE>只是你从没那样想过
<39-9,CASTLE>Only that thought never even occurred to you,

876
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:46,160
<39-9,CASTLE>因为内心深处  你喜欢做破碎的人
<39-9,CASTLE>because deep down inside, you like being broken,

877
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:48,300
<39-9,CASTLE>而你需要这样的执念
<39-9,CASTLE>and you need this obsession.

878
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:51,300
<39-9,CASTLE>无论我怎么做  都无法改变
<39-9,CASTLE>And no matter what I do, I can't change that.

879
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,370
<39-9,CASTLE>只有你能  凯特
<39-9,CASTLE>Only you can, Kate.

880
00:35:56,850 --> 00:35:58,790
<39-10,ESPOSITO>警员发现阿科斯塔的同伙
<39-10,ESPOSITO>Hey, uniforms just spotted Acosta's partner

881
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:00,290
<39-10,ESPOSITO>正进入他的公寓
<39-10,ESPOSITO>going into his building.

882
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:01,840
<39-10,ESPOSITO>我们要去抓他
<39-10,ESPOSITO>We're gonna go roust him.

883
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:03,820
<39-10,ESPOSITO>不过你不去也行
<39-10,ESPOSITO>But we can roll without you.

884
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:05,500
<39-11,CASTLE>没事  反正我也要走了
<39-11,CASTLE>No, actually, I was just leaving.

885
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:06,660
<39-12,BECKETT>等等  卡塞尔
<39-12,BECKETT>Wait, no, Castle.

886
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,280
<39-13,CASTLE>你有工作要做
<39-13,CASTLE>You have a job to do.

887
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,620
<39-13,CASTLE>没人比你做得更好
<39-13,CASTLE>And there's no one better.

888
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:30,520
<40-1,OFFICER ELLROY>朗加佐大约四十分钟前进去的
<40-1,OFFICER ELLROY>Longarzo came in about 40 minutes ago.

889
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,390
<40-2,BECKETT>-跟别人一起吗  -不  就他自己
<40-2,BECKETT>- Anybody with him? - No, he's alone.

890
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,760
<40-3,OFFICER ELLROY>而且据我所知  公寓里
<40-3,OFFICER ELLROY>And there's no one else in the apartment

891
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,550
<40-3,OFFICER ELLROY>并没有其他人
<40-3,OFFICER ELLROY>as far as I can tell.

892
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:36,100
<40-4,BECKETT>好的  剩下的交给我们吧  谢谢你
<40-4,BECKETT>All right, we'll take it from here. Thank you.

893
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:38,840
<40-5,RYAN>如果这人真的是贩毒集团的人
<40-5,RYAN>If this guy really is Cartel,

894
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,910
<40-5,RYAN>那间公寓里一定有武器
<40-5,RYAN>he might have an arsenal up in that apartment.

895
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:41,980
<40-5,RYAN>是不是该叫紧急应急小组来
<40-5,RYAN>Should we call ESU?

896
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:56,370
<40-6,ESPOSITO>纽约警局
<40-6,ESPOSITO>NYPD!

897
00:36:57,970 --> 00:36:58,870
<40-6,ESPOSITO>别跑
<40-6,ESPOSITO>Hey! Stop!

898
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:00,350
<40-7,ESPOSITO>下来
<40-7,ESPOSITO>Get down!

899
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:07,610
<40-8,ESPOSITO>枪
<40-8,ESPOSITO>Gun!

900
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,530
<40-8,ESPOSITO>不
<40-8,ESPOSITO>No!

901
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:32,220
<41-1,VIKRAM>-你还好吗  -不好
<41-1,VIKRAM>- You okay? - No.

902
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,620
<41-2,BECKETT>阿科斯塔的同伙本可以让我们接近洛克塞特
<41-2,BECKETT>Acosta's partner could have brought us closer to LokSat.

903
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,320
<41-2,BECKETT>结果他却躺在了停尸间
<41-2,BECKETT>Instead, he's in the morgue.

904
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:39,780
<41-2,BECKETT>这一切都在我眼皮子底下崩塌了
<41-2,BECKETT>It's all come crashing down around my ears,

905
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:41,890
<41-2,BECKETT>而我却只能怪自己
<41-2,BECKETT>and I've got nobody to blame but myself.

906
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:43,760
<41-3,VIKRAM>你要在这自怨自艾
<41-3,VIKRAM>Ah, you are having a pity party.

907
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:45,070
<41-3,VIKRAM>完全可以  我走
<41-3,VIKRAM>That's okay. I'll leave.

908
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:48,550
<41-3,VIKRAM>但我可能找到了一个非常好的线索
<41-3,VIKRAM>But I will be taking a pretty juicy clue with me.

909
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,280
<41-4,BECKETT>如果你敢耍我  我会开枪打你的
<41-4,BECKETT>If you're messing with me, I might shoot you.

910
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:53,120
<41-5,VIKRAM>想知道我发现了什么吗
<41-5,VIKRAM>Does that mean you want to hear what I got?

911
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:53,990
<41-6,BECKETT>当然
<41-6,BECKETT>Yeah.

912
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:55,930
<41-6,BECKETT>好吧
<41-6,BECKETT>Okay. Okay.

913
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:58,680
<41-7,VIKRAM>我追踪到了萨姆·麦基藏匿海洛因
<41-7,VIKRAM>I was able to trace the ownership of the warehouse

914
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,370
<41-7,VIKRAM>那个仓库的拥有者
<41-7,VIKRAM>where Sam Mackey dropped off the heroin.

915
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,680
<41-7,VIKRAM>是保时捷控股的一间公司
<41-7,VIKRAM>It's a Cayman's shell corp.

916
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,900
<41-7,VIKRAM>我又深挖了一下从1999年至今的公司文件
<41-7,VIKRAM>I dug back into the articles of incorporation from '99.

917
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:07,490
<41-7,VIKRAM>你绝不会相信那些文件是谁写的
<41-7,VIKRAM>You won't believe - who wrote up those documents.

918
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:10,260
<41-7,VIKRAM>卡莱布·布朗
<41-7,VIKRAM>Caleb Brown.

919
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:13,050
<41-8,BECKETT>阿科斯塔的公共辩护律师吗
<41-8,BECKETT>Acosta's public defender?

920
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:16,520
<41-9,VIKRAM>结果发现布朗过去任职于一间
<41-9,VIKRAM>Turns out Brown worked for a major corporate law firm

921
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,070
<41-9,VIKRAM>大型律师事务所
<41-9,VIKRAM>back in the day.

922
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:19,030
<41-9,VIKRAM>每年收入都在50万美元左右
<41-9,VIKRAM>Pulled in mid-six figures annually.

923
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:21,080
<41-9,VIKRAM>然后他几年前突然辞职了
<41-9,VIKRAM>Then he suddenly gave it up a few years ago

924
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,220
<41-9,VIKRAM>给人当起了辩护律师
<41-9,VIKRAM>to be a defender of the people.

925
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:24,470
<41-10,BECKETT>那是个完美的掩护身份
<41-10,BECKETT>That's the perfect cover.

926
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:26,680
<41-10,BECKETT>这让布朗可以接触到狱中的贩毒成员
<41-10,BECKETT>It gives Brown access to assets in prison

927
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,550
<41-10,BECKETT>让他可以为那些
<41-10,BECKETT>and allows him to pass orders

928
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:30,510
<41-10,BECKETT>已经被抓获的毒贩下达命令
<41-10,BECKETT>to dealers that we've already caught.

929
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:32,280
<41-11,VIKRAM>像阿科斯塔那样的毒贩
<41-11,VIKRAM>Dealers like Acosta.

930
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:35,470
<41-12,BECKETT>布朗让阿科斯塔顶下谋杀劳拉的罪行
<41-12,BECKETT>Brown told Acosta to take the fall for Lara's murder

931
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:37,470
<41-12,BECKETT>这样我们就不会再追查毒品
<41-12,BECKETT>so that we would back off of the drugs.

932
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:40,270
<41-13,VIKRAM>而阿科斯塔照做了  布朗就是这么厉害
<41-13,VIKRAM>And Acosta obliged. That's how powerful Brown is.

933
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,930
<41-14,BECKETT>好吧  我们不能直接去找这个人
<41-14,BECKETT>Okay, we can't go straight at this guy.

934
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:44,410
<41-14,BECKETT>他不是吓坏的卡车司机  他是头鲨鱼
<41-14,BECKETT>He's not a scared truck driver. This guy is a shark.

935
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:47,370
<41-14,BECKETT>他若知道我们找上他  洛克塞特会灭了我们
<41-14,BECKETT>And if he sees us coming, LokSat's gonna burn all of us.

936
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:51,420
<41-14,BECKETT>我们必须暗地里追查布朗的行踪
<41-14,BECKETT>We've got to track Brown's every move nice and quiet.

937
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,570
<41-15,VIKRAM>这会花点时间
<41-15,VIKRAM>It's gonna take time.

938
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:55,660
<41-16,BECKETT>是的  但如果我们做得好...
<41-16,BECKETT>Yeah, but if we do it right...

939
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:00,840
<41-16,BECKETT>他会直接带我们找到洛克赛特
<41-16,BECKETT>He'll lead us straight to LokSat.

940
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:23,020
<42-1,LUCY>我以为你说撒谎是不对的
<42-1,LUCY>I thought you said lying was wrong.

941
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,340
<42-2,CASTLE>没错  可是...
<42-2,CASTLE>I did. It is, but...

942
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,310
<42-2,CASTLE>她认为她在保护我
<42-2,CASTLE>She thought she was protecting me.

943
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:31,450
<42-3,LUCY>好吧  那意思是你原谅她了吗
<42-3,LUCY>Okay, so does that mean you could forgive her?

944
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:35,390
<42-4,CASTLE>我不知道  也许吧
<42-4,CASTLE>I don't know. Maybe.

945
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:37,320
<42-5,LUCY>好吧  别误会我的意思  里克
<42-5,LUCY>Yeah, don't take this the wrong way, Rick,

946
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,500
<42-5,LUCY>但你的话毫无意义
<42-5,LUCY>but you don't make any sense.

947
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:41,250
<42-6,CASTLE>那是因为我深爱着她
<42-6,CASTLE>Well, that's because I'm in love.

948
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,500
<42-6,CASTLE>但你是不会明白的
<42-6,CASTLE>But you wouldn't understand that.

949
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,880
<42-7,LUCY>那你为什么要跟我说这些呢
<42-7,LUCY>So why are you talking to me about it?

950
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:49,260
<42-7,LUCY>问得好
<42-7,LUCY>Touche.

951
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:56,960
<42-9,BECKETT>你说得对
<42-9,BECKETT>You were right.

952
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,240
<42-10,CASTLE>好吧
<42-10,CASTLE>Okay.

953
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:03,190
<42-11,BECKETT>你说得每一句话都是对的
<42-11,BECKETT>Everything that you said, you were absolutely right.

954
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:05,180
<42-12,CASTLE>能再具体一点吗
<42-12,CASTLE>Could you be more specific?

955
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:07,950
<42-13,BECKETT>我们本可以把分手作为掩饰
<42-13,BECKETT>That our break-up - could have just been a cover

956
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:10,360
<42-13,BECKETT>这样我们就能联手扳倒洛克赛特
<42-13,BECKETT>so that we could bring down LokSat together.

957
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:11,620
<42-13,BECKETT>是的
<42-13,BECKETT>Yeah.

958
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:13,700
<42-14,CASTLE>我希望你那时能来找我
<42-14,CASTLE>I wish you would have come to me.

959
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:14,620
<42-15,BECKETT>现在我来了...
<42-15,BECKETT>Well, I'm here now...

960
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:17,040
<42-15,BECKETT>我们来吧
<42-15,BECKETT>So let's do it.

961
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:20,060
<42-16,CASTLE>并不是那么简单的
<42-16,CASTLE>It's not that easy.

962
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:23,350
<42-17,BECKETT>我以为你会...
<42-17,BECKETT>I thought that you would --

963
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:26,390
<42-18,CASTLE>会原谅你  无视你曾经让我经历过的痛苦吗
<42-18,CASTLE>Just take you back, in spite of what you put me through?

964
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:32,000
<42-19,BECKETT>卡塞尔  对不起  我恨自己伤害了你
<42-19,BECKETT>Look, Castle, I am sorry. I hate that I hurt you.

965
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,460
<42-19,BECKETT>那从不是我希望的结果
<42-19,BECKETT>That was never what I wanted.

966
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:37,620
<42-20,CASTLE>但你的确伤害我了  凯特  而更糟的是...
<42-20,CASTLE>But you did hurt me, Kate, and what's worse...

967
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,020
<42-20,CASTLE>-你对我失去信心了  -不  我从没...
<42-20,CASTLE>- You lost faith in me. - No, I never --

968
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:43,390
<42-21,BECKETT>我需要你  里克
<42-21,BECKETT>I need you, Rick.

969
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:45,900
<42-21,BECKETT>在这件事发生前  我从未想到
<42-21,BECKETT>I didn't realize even how much I needed you

970
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,270
<42-21,BECKETT>自己会如此需要你
<42-21,BECKETT>until this happened.

971
00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:52,570
<42-21,BECKETT>求你  别让我独自经历这些
<42-21,BECKETT>Please, just don't make me do this without you.

972
00:40:58,790 --> 00:40:59,550
<42-22,CASTLE>好吧
<42-22,CASTLE>Okay.

973
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:14,010
<42-23,CASTLE>但你知道
<42-23,CASTLE>Though you do realize

974
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:16,890
<42-23,CASTLE>我必须先惩罚你一下
<42-23,CASTLE>I'm gonna have to punish you a little first.

975
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:18,900
<42-24,BECKETT>裸体惩罚吗
<42-24,BECKETT>Naked punishing?

976
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:21,650
