1
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:12,200
<2-1,HAYLEY SHIPTON>提醒我一下  我为什么要这么做
<2-1,HAYLEY SHIPTON>Remind me, why am I doing this?

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,120
<2-2,BRYCE ROBERTS>因为我在马拉喀什救过你一命
<2-2,BRYCE ROBERTS>Because I saved your ass in Marrakesh.

6
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,340
<2-3,HAYLEY>是我让你救我的  老头子
<2-3,HAYLEY>Uh, I let you save my ass, old man,

9
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:18,240
<2-3,HAYLEY>就为了让你给那个你喜欢的
<2-3,HAYLEY>so that you could impress little miss naughty-knickers,

10
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,740
<2-3,HAYLEY>小妞留下好印象
<2-3,HAYLEY>who you had a crush on.

12
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,770
<2-4,MARCUS JANEK>作为一对前间谍
<2-4,MARCUS JANEK>You know, for a couple of ex-spies,

13
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,350
<2-4,MARCUS JANEK>你们听上去更像放春假的联谊会女生
<2-4,MARCUS JANEK>you sound a lot like sorority girls at spring break.

14
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:26,990
<2-5,BRYCE>海莉  这是马库斯  他会跟你一起去
<2-5,BRYCE>Hayley, this is Marcus. He's going in with you.

16
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:28,740
<2-6,MARCUS>布莱斯告诉我你挺厉害
<2-6,MARCUS>Bryce told me you were a badass,

17
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,210
<2-6,MARCUS>但他没说你是限制级的幻想尤物
<2-6,MARCUS>but he didn't say you were an X-rated fantasy.

19
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:34,710
<2-7,HAYLEY>我实在很难被你的魅力所倾倒
<2-7,HAYLEY>It's very hard to focus on how charming you are

20
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,970
<2-7,HAYLEY>因为你的口气像节日的厕所一样
<2-7,HAYLEY>when your breath smells like a festival toilet.

24
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,840
<2-8,HAYLEY>拜托告诉我他的身手
<2-8,HAYLEY>Please tell me he's a better sneak

25
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,530
<2-8,HAYLEY>比泡妞技术好
<2-8,HAYLEY>than he is a pickup artist.

26
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,610
<2-9,BRYCE>工作很简单  最多就20分钟
<2-9,BRYCE>A simple job. 20 minutes tops.

27
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:47,180
<2-9,BRYCE>我的客户嫁给了
<2-9,BRYCE>My client is married

28
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,800
<2-9,BRYCE>曼彻斯特国际能源公司的副总
<2-9,BRYCE>to the VP of Manchester Energy International --

29
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,830
<2-9,BRYCE>保罗·霍斯顿
<2-9,BRYCE>Paul Halston.

30
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:52,780
<2-9,BRYCE>她确定他在偷情
<2-9,BRYCE>She's convinced he's cheating.

31
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:56,050
<2-9,BRYCE>所以  马库斯会搞定大楼安保措施
<2-9,BRYCE>So, Marcus will bypass building security,

32
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:59,940
<2-9,BRYCE>海莉去在他办公室的电脑上装好间谍软件
<2-9,BRYCE>while Hayley puts spyware on his office computer.

33
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:02,430
<2-10,HAYLEY>好了  我们走吧
<2-10,HAYLEY>All right. Let's do this.

34
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,170
<2-11,BRYCE>再次感谢  我欠你个人情
<2-11,BRYCE>Thanks again. I owe you.

35
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,370
<2-12,HAYLEY>当然了
<2-12,HAYLEY>Yes, you do.

38
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:38,170
<2-13,HAYLEY>这是什么间谍软件啊
<2-13,HAYLEY>What kind of spyware is this?

39
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,180
<2-13,HAYLEY>上传好慢
<2-13,HAYLEY>It's taking forever to upload.

40
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,030
<2-14,UNIDENTIFIED MAN>这里是我的办公室
<2-14,UNIDENTIFIED MAN>This is my office.

00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,000
<2-17,HAYLEY>这才叫安全漏洞呢
<2-17,HAYLEY>Talk about a breach of security.

44
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,230
<2-18,MARCUS>我可是很想突破她的安保
<2-18,MARCUS>I'd like to breach hers, that's for sure.

45
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,820
<2-19,UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN>你不行
<2-19,UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN>You cannot.

46

48
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,640
<2-21,UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN>这样才对嘛
<2-21,UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN>I guess it's only fair, right?

49
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,810
<2-22,UNIDENTIFIED MAN>你要给我看吗
<2-22,UNIDENTIFIED MAN>You gonna show me?

50
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,430
<2-23,MARCUS>他可远远配不上她
<2-23,MARCUS>She's way out of his league.

51

<2-24,HAYLEY>你也是

53
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,640
<2-26,MARCUS>我赌10块他都
<2-26,MARCUS>10 bucks he can't even figure out

54
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:28,900
<2-26,MARCUS>不会脱那衣服
<2-26,MARCUS>how to get that thing off.

55
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,070
<2-27,HAYLEY>我就不下注了
<2-27,HAYLEY>Pass.

00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:14,410
<3-2,BECKETT>不不不
<3-2,BECKETT>No, no, no, no. No.

63
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,340
<3-3,CASTLE>我打鼾了吗
<3-3,CASTLE>Oh, did I snore?

64
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,860
<3-4,BECKETT>嗯  但问题不在那里
<3-4,BECKETT>Yeah, but that's not the problem.

65
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:18,900
<3-5,CASTLE>那是什么
<3-5,CASTLE>What was?

66
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,470
<3-6,BECKETT>你背叛了我
<3-6,BECKETT>You betrayed me.

67
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,240
<3-7,CASTLE>什么  怎么说  什么时候
<3-7,CASTLE>What? How? When?

68
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,040
<3-8,BECKETT>昨晚  在我梦里
<3-8,BECKETT>Last night, in my dreams.

69
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,510
<3-9,CASTLE>但那...我...怎么会...
<3-9,CASTLE>But that's -- I-I -- What's, uh -- How --

70
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:34,260
<3-9,CASTLE>我究竟做了什么罪大恶极的事
<3-9,CASTLE>What could I have possibly done that was so wrong?

71
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,050
<3-10,BECKETT>算了
<3-10,BECKETT>You know what? Never mind.

72
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:36,710
<3-10,BECKETT>我不想再经历一遍
<3-10,BECKETT>I-I don't even want to relive it.

73
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,110
<3-11,CASTLE>严格讲  你没经历  那是做梦
<3-11,CASTLE>Well, technically, you didn't live it. You just dreamed it.

74
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,470
<3-11,CASTLE>但我...
<3-11,CASTLE>That's -- But I...

75
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:45,220
<3-11,CASTLE>不管我做了什么  我很抱歉
<3-11,CASTLE>Whatever I did, I am so sorry.

76
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,410
<3-12,BECKETT>是分局打来的
<3-12,BECKETT>It's the precinct.

77
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:48,730
<3-13,CASTLE>我为什么觉得一桩凶案刚刚救了我一命
<3-13,CASTLE>Why do I feel like - a murder just saved my life?

79
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,340
<4-1,MARTHA>好了  女士们  我已经决定
<4-1,MARTHA>Okay, ladies, I have decided

80
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:55,300
<4-1,MARTHA>我要改下我的签名
<4-1,MARTHA>that I should change my autograph.

81
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:59,230
<4-1,MARTHA>怎么样
<4-1,MARTHA>So...what do you think?

82
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,820
<4-2,ALEXIS>奶奶  那个跟你平时的签名没区别啊
<4-2,ALEXIS>Gram, that looks exactly like your usual autograph.

83
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:05,190
<4-2,ALEXIS>不不不
<4-2,ALEXIS>No, no, no, no, no.

84
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:07,460
<4-2,ALEXIS>我平时的签名
<4-2,ALEXIS>My usual autograph,

85
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:10,280
<4-3,MARTHA>当我还只是个演员时的签名
<4-3,MARTHA>when I am merely an actress,

86
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,540
<4-3,MARTHA>是这样的  挺随意  古怪的
<4-3,MARTHA>is like this, sort of carefree and -- and whimsical,

88
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:18,730
<4-3,MARTHA>而另一个  则很有内涵和智慧
<4-3,MARTHA>whereas the other conveys insight, wisdom.

89
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,870
<4-3,MARTHA>两者完全不同  看不出来吗
<4-3,MARTHA>They're completely different. Can't you see that?

90
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,200
<4-4,HAYLEY>-内涵  -智慧
<4-4,HAYLEY>- Insight. - Wisdom.

91
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,260
<4-6,HAYLEY>-是啊  -当然了
<4-6,HAYLEY>- Sure. - Yes, absolutely.

92
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,000
<4-7,ALEXIS>好样的
<4-7,ALEXIS>Good job.

93
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,150
<4-8,HAYLEY>好了  失陪一下
<4-8,HAYLEY>Now, if you'll excuse me,

94
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:27,320
<4-8,HAYLEY>我还要经营生意
<4-8,HAYLEY>I have a business to run,

95
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,980
<4-8,HAYLEY>尤其鉴于那个谁根本指望不上
<4-8,HAYLEY>especially since you-know-who is completely useless.

96
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:30,590
<4-9,CASTLE>我听到了
<4-9,CASTLE>I heard that.

97
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:32,970
<4-9,CASTLE>如果我根本指望不上  贝克特为什么
<4-9,CASTLE>And if I'm so useless, why would Beckett ask me

98
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:34,580
<4-9,CASTLE>要让我参谋一桩凶案呢
<4-9,CASTLE>to consult on a murder?

99
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,590
<4-9,CASTLE>-母亲  新签名啊  -是的
<4-9,CASTLE>- Oh, Mother, new autograph. - Yeah.

100
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:38,690
<4-11,CASTLE>不错  很有智慧和内涵
<4-11,CASTLE>Nice. Conveys wisdom, insight.

101
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,650
<4-11,CASTLE>我喜欢
<4-11,CASTLE>I like it.

102
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,060
<4-12,CASTLE>好了  我拿上车钥匙
<4-12,CASTLE>All right, I just need my car keys,

103
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,370
<4-12,CASTLE>这就去曼彻斯特能源大厦了
<4-12,CASTLE>and I'm off to the Manchester Energy building.

104
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,660
<4-13,HAYLEY>等等  曼彻斯特能源发生了凶案
<4-13,HAYLEY>Wait, murder at Manchester Energy?

105
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,410
<4-13,HAYLEY>被害人是谁
<4-13,HAYLEY>Who's the victim?

106
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:48,400
<4-14,CASTLE>只知道是"男性被害人"
<4-14,CASTLE>All they said was "dead male."

107
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:51,280
<4-15,HAYLEY>要知道  里克  我还从未亲眼见过你在
<4-15,HAYLEY>You know, Rick, I have never seen you in action

108
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,830
<4-15,HAYLEY>纽约警局的犯罪现场侦查呢
<4-15,HAYLEY>at an NYPD crime scene.

109
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,480
<4-16,CASTLE>或许你想一起跟来
<4-16,CASTLE>Well, perhaps you'd like to tag along

110
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,610
<4-16,CASTLE>看看犯罪现场绝地大师干活儿吗
<4-16,CASTLE>and watch the crime-scene Jedi master at work.

111
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:59,110
<4-17,HAYLEY>拜托告诉我你不那么自称吧
<4-17,HAYLEY>Please tell me you do not refer to yourself as that.

112
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,670
<4-17,HAYLEY>真的假的
<4-17,HAYLEY>Do you really?

113
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,130
<4-18,CASTLE>或许你还是下次再来吧
<4-18,CASTLE>Perhaps you should come watch another time.

114
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:04,520
<4-19,HAYLEY>不不  走吧  卡塞尔·旺·肯诺比
<4-19,HAYLEY>No, no, no. Lead on, Castle Wan Kenobi.

115
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,230
<4-19,HAYLEY>你是我唯一的希望
<4-19,HAYLEY>You are my only hope.

116
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,780
<4-20,CASTLE>这句不错  留着
<4-20,CASTLE>I like that, but save it.

117
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,120
<4-20,CASTLE>回头当着他们的面说
<4-20,CASTLE>Say it in front of the guys.

118
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:13,770
<5-1,ESPOSITO>海莉  怎么回事
<5-1,ESPOSITO>Hayley, what happened?

119
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:15,430
<5-1,ESPOSITO>你是赌输了  不得不跟着
<5-1,ESPOSITO>Did you lose a bet, and now Castle gets

120
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,870
<5-1,ESPOSITO>卡塞尔到处跑吗
<5-1,ESPOSITO>to drag you everywhere he goes?

121
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,780
<5-2,CASTLE>恰恰相反
<5-2,CASTLE>Quite the contrary.

122
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:21,830
<5-2,CASTLE>海莉是想看我再破一案
<5-2,CASTLE>Hayley actually wanted to watch me solve yet another murder.

123
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:24,800
<5-3,RYAN>你是指帮忙吧  你帮忙破案
<5-3,RYAN>You mean help solve. You...help.

124
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,680
<5-4,ESPOSITO>记住  哥们  没了我们  你是不可能破案的
<5-4,ESPOSITO>Yeah, remember, bro, you cannot solve a homicide without us.

125
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,450
<5-5,RYAN>而我们没你是绝对可以破案的
<5-5,RYAN>While we sure as hell can solve one without you.

126
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:31,300
<5-6,HAYLEY>是吗  因为来的路上
<5-6,HAYLEY>Really? Because on the ride over here,

127
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,120
<5-6,HAYLEY>里克好顿吹嘘说纽约警局破不了案呢
<5-6,HAYLEY>Rick was bragging about how the NYPD can't close a case.

128
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,170
<5-7,CASTLE>那都只是玩笑话
<5-7,CASTLE>Eh, t-those were just jokes that --

129
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,630
<5-7,CASTLE>如果不看语境就没那么好玩了
<5-7,CASTLE>Out of context, it's not as funny.

130
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:39,480
<5-7,CASTLE>我说的时候还翻白眼来着
<5-7,CASTLE>I was rolling my eyes when I said it.

131
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,200
<5-8,CASTLE>多谢你背后捅刀啊
<5-8,CASTLE>Thank you for stabbing me in the back.

132
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,720
<5-9,LANIE>你不是唯一背后挨刀的
<5-9,LANIE>You weren't the only one.

133
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,910
<5-9,LANIE>被害人背后
<5-9,LANIE>Our victim took his

134
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:48,140
<5-9,LANIE>这刀插在T4  T5椎骨之间
<5-9,LANIE>right between his T4 and T5 vertebrae.

135
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,980
<5-9,LANIE>脊髓被切断  即刻死亡
<5-9,LANIE>Severed his spinal cord. Died instantly.

136
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:53,350
<5-10,CASTLE>看他的外套  不是员工喽
<5-10,CASTLE>I'm guessing from his outfit, he wasn't an employee?

137
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:54,870
<5-11,ESPOSITO>很可能是个贼
<5-11,ESPOSITO>Most likely some kind of thief.

138
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:55,740
<5-12,RYAN>还挺厉害
<5-12,RYAN>Pretty good one at that.

139
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,110
<5-12,RYAN>安保系统完全没有被触动
<5-12,RYAN>None of the security was tripped.

140
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,820
<5-12,RYAN>监控都被关闭了
<5-12,RYAN>All the cameras were shut down.

141
00:05:58,820 --> 00:05:59,880
<5-13,CASTLE>有什么失窃的吗
<5-13,CASTLE>Was anything stolen?

142
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:00,770
<5-14,RYAN>有什么好偷的
<5-14,RYAN>What's there to steal?

143
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:03,270
<5-14,RYAN>这是一家能源公司大楼
<5-14,RYAN>I mean, this is an energy-company office building.

144
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:06,230
<5-14,RYAN>唯一有价值的就是家具和电脑
<5-14,RYAN>The only thing of value are the furniture and the computers.

145
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:06,900
<5-15,HAYLEY>我可以看看吗
<5-15,HAYLEY>May I?

146
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,540
<5-16,ESPOSITO>显然  我们完全无助
<5-16,ESPOSITO>Clearly, we're helpless.

147
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:11,990
<5-16,ESPOSITO>来吧  卡塞尔  替我们破案吧
<5-16,ESPOSITO>So, come on, Castle, please, solve this case for us.

148
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:14,470
<5-17,CASTLE>我们唯一确定的
<5-17,CASTLE>Well, the only thing we know for sure is --

149
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:16,300
<5-18,HAYLEY>他死在凌晨3:27
<5-18,HAYLEY>He was killed at 3:27 a.m.

150
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,670
<5-19,LANIE>很不错啊  海莉
<5-19,LANIE>Very good, Hayley.

151
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,330
<5-20,CASTLE>等等  什么  你怎么知道
<5-20,CASTLE>Wait. What? How did you know that?

152
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:20,100
<5-21,HAYLEY>表砸坏了
<5-21,HAYLEY>Broken watch.

153
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,660
<5-21,HAYLEY>肯定是摔倒时撞坏了
<5-21,HAYLEY>He must have busted it when he hit the ground.

154
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,170
<5-22,RYAN>埃斯波西托  我们有海莉啊
<5-22,RYAN>Esposito, we have Hayley.

155
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:24,490
<5-22,RYAN>-还要卡塞尔做什么  -是啊
<5-22,RYAN>- What do we need Castle for? - Yeah.

156
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:25,520
<5-24,CASTLE>这好笑
<5-24,CASTLE>Super funny, guys.

157
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,830
<5-24,CASTLE>那只是走运  我还是能帮忙确定被害人身份的
<5-24,CASTLE>That was lucky, and I can still help I.D. this victim,

158
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:29,620
<5-24,CASTLE>非常感谢
<5-24,CASTLE>thank you very much.

159
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,260
<5-24,CASTLE>蕾妮  查下指纹
<5-24,CASTLE>Lanie, run a fingerprint scan.

160
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:32,990
<5-24,CASTLE>听着  卡塞尔
<5-24,CASTLE>Okay, look, Castle,

161
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,640
<5-25,LANIE>我不知道这是怎么回事
<5-25,LANIE>I don't know what all of this is about,

162
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,120
<5-25,LANIE>但我没教你写书
<5-25,LANIE>but I don't tell you how to write your books,

163
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,090
<5-25,LANIE>你也别叫我怎么查身份
<5-25,LANIE>so don't tell me how to I.D. a body.

164
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:39,650
<5-25,LANIE>我已经进行了扫描
<5-25,LANIE>I've already performed a scan.

165
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,660
<5-25,LANIE>我在等结果呢
<5-25,LANIE>I'm just waiting for the results.

166
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:48,220
<5-26,HAYLEY>你觉得可以靠这个薄荷糖的购买
<5-26,HAYLEY>Uh, do you think it's possible to identify the victim

167
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:49,560
<5-26,HAYLEY>确认死者身份吗
<5-26,HAYLEY>from the purchase of these mints?

168
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,120
<5-27,CASTLE>是可以
<5-27,CASTLE>I guess we could.

169
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,690
<5-27,CASTLE>比扫描指纹要高效多了
<5-27,CASTLE>It's far more efficient to use a fingerprint scanner.

170
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:57,080
<5-28,HAYLEY>我污染了证物
<5-28,HAYLEY>I-I just bolloxed up a piece of evidence.

171
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,360
<5-29,CASTLE>-真抱歉  -太菜了  是吧
<5-29,CASTLE>- I'm so sorry. - Rookie move, right?

172
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,890
<5-30,ESPOSITO>因为你从未在犯罪现场乱碰过
<5-30,ESPOSITO>Because you've never touched anything at a crime scene.

173
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:04,910
<5-31,LANIE>记下这个上面沾了海莉的指纹
<5-31,LANIE>Make note that this is contaminated with Hayley's prints.

174
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,110
<5-32,HAYLEY>真抱歉
<5-32,HAYLEY>So sorry.

175
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:10,350
<5-33,RYAN>好了  有死者身份了
<5-33,RYAN>Oh, here we go. We got an I.D. on our victim.

176
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:13,660
<5-33,RYAN>名叫马库斯·雅尼克
<5-33,RYAN>His name is Marcus Janek.

177
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,900
<5-33,RYAN>是个窃贼
<5-33,RYAN>He's, uh, yeah -- a second-story man

178
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,140
<5-34,ESPOSITO>有一系列前科
<5-34,ESPOSITO>with a history of priors.

179
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,370
<5-34,ESPOSITO>看来有人抓了马库斯现行便杀了他
<5-34,ESPOSITO>Looks like somebody caught Marcus in the act and killed him.

180
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:22,190
<5-35,CASTLE>或许马库斯有个搭档
<5-35,CASTLE>Or perhaps Marcus had a partner.

181
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:22,910
<5-36,HAYLEY>搭档
<5-36,HAYLEY>Partner?

182
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:25,840
<5-37,CASTLE>马库斯是个盗贼  他应该很警觉
<5-37,CASTLE>Well, Marcus is a burglar. He would be on high alert.

183
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,220
<5-37,CASTLE>而他能让人走到他背后
<5-37,CASTLE>The only reason he'd let someone behind him

184
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:30,040
<5-37,CASTLE>肯定是因为信任对方  就是搭档喽
<5-37,CASTLE>is if he trusted that person, I.E. a partner.

185
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,120
<5-37,CASTLE>我们找到跟马库斯一起闯进来的人
<5-37,CASTLE>We find the person Marcus broke in here with,

186
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,300
<5-37,CASTLE>就能找到凶手
<5-37,CASTLE>we find his killer.

187
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,300
<5-38,RYAN>厉害啊  卡塞尔
<5-38,RYAN>Very good, Castle.

188
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,860
<5-39,ESPOSITO>是啊  讲得通
<5-39,ESPOSITO>Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

189
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:37,710
<5-40,CASTLE>你们为什么一副很惊讶的样子
<5-40,CASTLE>Why are you acting surprised?

191
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:40,690
<5-41,HAYLEY>不知是否重要
<5-41,HAYLEY>I don't know if it's important at all,

192
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:43,160
<5-41,HAYLEY>但所有椅子都放进去摆好的  除了那个
<5-41,HAYLEY>but all those chairs are tucked in, except for that one.

193
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:44,210
<5-41,HAYLEY>除了那边那个
<5-41,HAYLEY>Except for that one there.

194
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:45,500
<5-42,CASTLE>是啊  我也注意到了
<5-42,CASTLE>Yep, I noticed that, too.

195
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,620
<5-42,CASTLE>早在她之前  进来时就发现了
<5-42,CASTLE>On the way in, way before she did.

196
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:50,470
<5-42,CASTLE>那么  奈德·沃纳
<5-42,CASTLE>So, Ned Werner.

197
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,810
<5-42,CASTLE>或许奈德昨晚加班了
<5-42,CASTLE>Perhaps Ned was working late last night.

198
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:54,060
<5-42,CASTLE>或许看到了什么
<5-42,CASTLE>Maybe he saw something,

199
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,390
<5-42,CASTLE>或许他是马库斯的搭档  内应
<5-42,CASTLE>or maybe he's Marcus' partner, an inside man.

200
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,460
<5-43,ESPOSITO>有请  莱恩警探
<5-43,ESPOSITO>Please, Detective Ryan.

201
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,460
<5-44,RYAN>多谢  埃斯波西托警探
<5-44,RYAN>Thank you, Detective Esposito.

202
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,000
<5-45,CASTLE>你们先请
<5-45,CASTLE>After you boys.

203
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:06,610
<6-1,BRYCE>喂
<6-1,BRYCE>Hello?

204
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:08,350
<6-2,HAYLEY>布莱斯  马库斯死了
<6-2,HAYLEY>Bryce, Marcus is dead.

205
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,510
<6-2,HAYLEY>怎么回事
<6-2,HAYLEY>What the hell is going on?

206
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,320
<6-2,HAYLEY>这跟你的客户有关吗
<6-2,HAYLEY>Does this have anything to do with your client?

207
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:13,020
<6-2,HAYLEY>海莉  对不起
<6-2,HAYLEY>Hayley, I'm sorry.

208
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:15,170
<6-3,BRYCE>我撒谎了
<6-3,BRYCE>I lied about everything.

209
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:18,750
<6-3,BRYCE>-根本没有出轨的丈夫或是愤怒的妻子  -什么
<6-3,BRYCE>- There is no cheating husband, nor an angry wife. - What?

210
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,190
<6-4,HAYLEY>你怎么能...
<6-4,HAYLEY>How could you be so --

211
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,400
<6-5,BRYCE>我别无选择
<6-5,BRYCE>I had no choice.

212
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:24,370
<6-6,HAYLEY>为什么  谁叫你这么做的
<6-6,HAYLEY>Why? Who put you up to this?

213
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:26,730
<6-7,BRYCE>无所谓了  现在都无所谓了
<6-7,BRYCE>It doesn't matter. Not anymore.

214
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:30,480
<6-7,BRYCE>你只需要知道代号44
<6-7,BRYCE>All you need to know is Code 44.

215
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,170
<6-7,BRYCE>对不起  海莉  真的很抱歉
<6-7,BRYCE>I'm sorry, Hayley. I'm so sorry.

216
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:38,120
<6-8,CASTLE>海莉  他们想...
<6-8,CASTLE>Hey, Hayley, the guys are thinking that...

217
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:40,800
<6-8,CASTLE>-一切都好吗  -不好
<6-8,CASTLE>- Everything okay? - Uh, no.

218
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,240
<6-9,HAYLEY>我一个朋友病了
<6-9,HAYLEY>A friend of mine's fallen ill,

219
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,880
<6-9,HAYLEY>我得去看看
<6-9,HAYLEY>and, um, I've got to swing by, check in.

220
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,050
<6-10,CASTLE>好
<6-10,CASTLE>Of course.

230
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:38,690
<7-1,HAYLEY>该死  阿丽克西斯  你来干什么
<7-1,HAYLEY>Damn it, Alexis. What are you doing here?!

231
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:40,110
<7-2,ALEXIS>我需要那些文件工作用
<7-2,ALEXIS>Well, I needed some case files for work.

232
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:41,830
<7-2,ALEXIS>但如果有人不请自来你就会这样
<7-2,ALEXIS>But if this is how you get when people come over unannounced,

233
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:43,950
<7-2,ALEXIS>我很乐意把备用钥匙还你
<7-2,ALEXIS>I am happy to give you back your spare key.

234
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:45,730
<7-2,ALEXIS>起来吧
<7-2,ALEXIS>Come on.

235
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:52,070
<7-3,ALEXIS>在重装修吗
<7-3,ALEXIS>So, uh, redecorating?

236
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:54,100
<7-4,HAYLEY>你得马上离开
<7-4,HAYLEY>You need to leave now.

237
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:54,990
<7-5,ALEXIS>我知道怎么回事
<7-5,ALEXIS>I see what's going on.

238
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:57,080
<7-5,ALEXIS>你拿了你的行李袋  和枪
<7-5,ALEXIS>You've got your go-bag, your guns.

239
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,180
<7-5,ALEXIS>这是你想去那个犯罪现场的原因吗
<7-5,ALEXIS>Is this why you wanted to go by that crime scene?

240
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:01,730
<7-5,ALEXIS>海莉  如果你有麻烦了  告诉我
<7-5,ALEXIS>Hayley, if you're in trouble, talk to me.

241
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:03,470
<7-6,HAYLEY>我不能  不安全
<7-6,HAYLEY>I can't. It's not safe.

242
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:08,270
<7-6,HAYLEY>好吧  听着  我昨晚帮了个朋友个忙
<7-6,HAYLEY>Okay, look, I did a favor for a friend last night --

243
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:09,780
<7-6,HAYLEY>至少  我当他是个朋友
<7-6,HAYLEY>at least, I thoughthe was a friend.

244
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,910
<7-6,HAYLEY>本该是个简单的私家侦探任务
<7-6,HAYLEY>It was meant to be a quick P.I. job,

245
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:14,070
<7-6,HAYLEY>但严格讲  我违背了法律
<7-6,HAYLEY>but technically, I broke a few laws.

246
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,930
<7-7,ALEXIS>好吧  告诉贝克特  告诉我爸
<7-7,ALEXIS>Okay, well, tell Beckett. Tell my dad.

247
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:18,500
<7-7,ALEXIS>-他们可以帮忙  -不行
<7-7,ALEXIS>- They can help. - No, they can't.

248
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:21,920
<7-8,HAYLEY>跟我合作的那个朋友  曾是我军情六处的同事
<7-8,HAYLEY>The friend I was working with -- We were in MI6 together.

249
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:22,880
<7-8,HAYLEY>他刚刚打来
<7-8,HAYLEY>He just phoned.

250
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,890
<7-8,HAYLEY>原来这趟活儿并不普通
<7-8,HAYLEY>It turns out that the job wasn't legit.

251
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:26,710
<7-8,HAYLEY>有更大的阴谋
<7-8,HAYLEY>Something bigger is going on,

252
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:29,680
<7-8,HAYLEY>而且严重到他对我说了代号44
<7-8,HAYLEY>something bad enough that he told me to go Code 44.

253
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,540
<7-9,ALEXIS>那是什么意思
<7-9,ALEXIS>Uh, what does Code 44 mean?

254
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,800
<7-10,HAYLEY>意思是抛弃一切  每个人
<7-10,HAYLEY>It means abandon everything and everyone.

255
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,370
<7-10,HAYLEY>马上逃命  不要回头看
<7-10,HAYLEY>It means run for your life and don't look back.

256
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:37,130
<7-11,ALEXIS>你不能那么做
<7-11,ALEXIS>You can't do that.

257
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:39,430
<7-12,HAYLEY>-我别无选择  -你有的
<7-12,HAYLEY>- I have no choice. - Yes, you do.

258
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,460
<7-13,ALEXIS>你居无定所那么多年
<7-13,ALEXIS>After years of floating from one place to the next,

259
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,990
<7-13,ALEXIS>你终于在这里找到了真正的家
<7-13,ALEXIS>you've finally found a real home here.

260
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:46,680
<7-14,HAYLEY>如果我留下就可能将你和这个家置于危险中
<7-14,HAYLEY>And I might be putting you and it in danger by staying.

261
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,980
<7-14,HAYLEY>我必须得马上走
<7-14,HAYLEY>I have to go now.

262
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:50,460
<7-15,ALEXIS>不  你该留下  抵抗
<7-15,ALEXIS>No, you have to stay and fight,

263
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,960
<7-15,ALEXIS>搞清楚究竟怎么回事  控制局面
<7-15,ALEXIS>figure out what's really going on here and fix it.

264
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,810
<7-15,ALEXIS>至少试试吧
<7-15,ALEXIS>Please at least try.

265
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,850
<8-1,CASTLE>先生们好啊
<8-1,CASTLE>Hello, gentlemen.

266
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,400
<8-2,RYAN>卡塞尔  你现在不该来这里
<8-2,RYAN>Castle, you shouldn't show your face around here right now.

267
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,200
<8-3,ESPOSITO>是啊  贝克特很生气
<8-3,ESPOSITO>Yeah. Beckett's pissed.

268
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,660
<8-4,CASTLE>各位  就是个梦而已
<8-4,CASTLE>Uh, guys, it was a dream.

269
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:17,420
<8-5,RYAN>梦是通往潜意识的大门  卡塞尔
<8-5,RYAN>Well, dreams are doorways to the subconscious, Castle.

270
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,620
<8-6,ESPOSITO>嗯  你做的事又太...
<8-6,ESPOSITO>Yeah. And what you did was just so...

271
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:20,680
<8-7,RYAN>过分了
<8-7,RYAN>...wrong.

272
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,210
<8-8,CASTLE>她跟你们说了我做了什么  我做了什么啊
<8-8,CASTLE>She told you what I did? What did I do?

273
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:23,970
<8-9,ESPOSITO>我们发誓保密的  哥们
<8-9,ESPOSITO>Well, we're sworn to secrecy, bro.

274
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:27,560
<8-10,RYAN>是啊  不像某些人  我们绝不会背叛贝克特
<8-10,RYAN>Yeah. Unlike some, we would never do that to Beckett.

275
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,830
<8-11,CASTLE>就是个梦啊
<8-11,CASTLE>It was a dream.

276
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,480
<8-12,RYAN>不管是不是梦  你在现实中做了什么
<8-12,RYAN>Well, dream or not, you did something in real life,

277
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,350
<8-12,RYAN>而贝克特的潜意识有所察觉
<8-12,RYAN>and Beckett's subconscious is picking up on it.

278
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:34,270
<8-13,ESPOSITO>你得想明白究竟是什么
<8-13,ESPOSITO>You need to figure out what that was

279
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:37,060
<8-13,ESPOSITO>然后趁还来得及赶紧交待
<8-13,ESPOSITO>and come clean before it's too late.

280
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,990
<8-15,RYAN>-奈德来了  -走吧
<8-15,RYAN>- Here's Ned. - Let's go.

281
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,100
<8-16,CASTLE>你朋友怎么样了
<8-16,CASTLE>How's your friend doing?

282
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,920
<8-17,HAYLEY>是啊  好多了  谢谢
<8-17,HAYLEY>Oh, uh, much better, thanks.

283
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,630
<8-17,HAYLEY>我现在有些好奇了
<8-17,HAYLEY>You know, my curiosity's been piqued.

284
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:51,700
<8-17,HAYLEY>我们可以看看他的审讯吗
<8-17,HAYLEY>Can we watch his interview?

285
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,650
<8-18,CASTLE>好啊  等到...
<8-18,CASTLE>Oh, sure. Just wait till...

286
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,160
<8-18,CASTLE>好了  走吧
<8-18,CASTLE>Okay, go.

287
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,630
<9-1,ESPOSITO>沃纳先生  告诉我们
<9-1,ESPOSITO>So, Mr. Werner, tell us where you were

288
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:59,670
<9-1,ESPOSITO>你凌晨3点到4点间在哪
<9-1,ESPOSITO>3:00 and 4:00 a.m. this morning.

289
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,110
<9-2,NED>在家  一个人睡觉
<9-2,NED>Home. Alone, asleep.

290
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:04,680
<9-3,RYAN>好奇怪  奈德  因为你的办公室电脑
<9-3,RYAN>Well, that's weird, Ned, because your office computer

291
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,590
<9-3,RYAN>显示你3:02还登录进去来着
<9-3,RYAN>says that you logged in at 3:02 a.m.,

292
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:09,440
<9-3,RYAN>就在凶案发生前几分钟
<9-3,RYAN>just minutes before the murder.

293
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,180
<9-4,NED>等等  对了
<9-4,NED>Oh, wait. Yeah, no. Yes, yes.

294
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,500
<9-4,NED>我...你们一提  我想起来了
<9-4,NED>I was, uh -- Now that you mention it, yes, I did.

295
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,270
<9-4,NED>我去了办公室一趟
<9-4,NED>I-I popped into the office for a bit,

296
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,600
<9-4,NED>做点工作
<9-4,NED>just to do some work.

297
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,890
<9-4,NED>我没在那儿见到他
<9-4,NED>I did not see him there.

298
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:19,140
<9-5,ESPOSITO>你当时一个人在办公室吗
<9-5,ESPOSITO>So you were in the office alone?

299
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,740
<9-6,NED>是的  绝对一个人
<9-6,NED>Yeah, completely alone.

300
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,380
<9-7,HAYLEY>你个撒谎的混蛋
<9-7,HAYLEY>You lying, little bastard.

301
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,060
<9-8,CASTLE>你为什么认为他说他是一个人是撒谎
<9-8,CASTLE>What makes you think he's lying about being alone?

302
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,050
<9-9,HAYLEY>看他的脖子
<9-9,HAYLEY>Look at his neck.

303
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:32,560
<9-9,HAYLEY>看到那个小吻痕了吗  是新的
<9-9,HAYLEY>See that tiny love bite? It's new.

304
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,380
<9-9,HAYLEY>如果奈德昨晚都是一个人  那是谁留下的
<9-9,HAYLEY>So if Ned was alone last night, who gave him that?

305
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:37,280
<9-10,ESPOSITO>你在撒谎吗  奈德
<9-10,ESPOSITO>Are you lying to us, Ned?

306
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:38,840
<9-11,NED>没有  我不会撒谎的
<9-11,NED>No. No, I would not lie.

307
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,960
<9-11,NED>绝不会
<9-11,NED>Never. No, no.

308
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,380
<9-12,RYAN>你说没过去就撒谎了
<9-12,RYAN>You lied about not being there.

309
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,330
<9-11,NED>我没有
<9-11,NED>No, I didn't. I didn't lie.

310
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:43,760
<9-14,ESPOSITO>-我只是忘了  -只是忘了
<9-14,ESPOSITO>- I just forgot. - Oh, you forgot?

311
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,110
<9-16,ESPOSITO>那或许你还忘记了别的
<9-16,ESPOSITO>So maybe there's something else you forgot.

312
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:47,450
<9-17,RYAN>或许你忘记了跟马库斯搭档  放他进去
<9-17,RYAN>Maybe you forgot that Marcus was your partner and you let him in.

313
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:49,440
<9-18,ESPOSITO>-忘记你杀了他  -没有
<9-18,ESPOSITO>- And you forgot that you killed him. - No.

314
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,600
<10-3,HAYLEY>-你记得杀了他喽  -是的
<10-3,HAYLEY>- So you remember killing him? - Yes.

315
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,470
<10-4,NED>-太棒了  -等等  不是的
<10-4,NED>- That's perfect. - Wait! No, no, no, no, no!

316
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:54,370
<10-5,NED>是的  我没忘
<10-5,NED>Yes, yes, yes, I didn't forget,

317
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:55,940
<9-24,NED>我没杀他
<9-24,NED>because, no, I didn't kill him.

318
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:57,550
<9-24,NED>我不认识这人
<9-24,NED>Look, I don't know this man.

319
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,340
<9-24,NED>我从未见过他
<9-24,NED>I've never seen him before in my life,

320
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,310
<9-24,NED>我不可能杀他
<9-24,NED>so I couldn't have killed him.

321
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:03,370
<9-25,RYAN>你的办公室电脑显示你3:10分登出电脑
<9-25,RYAN>So, your office computer says you logged out at 3:10 a.m.

322
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:05,430
<9-25,RYAN>而他是3:27被杀的
<9-25,RYAN>He was killed at 3:27 a.m.

323
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:06,870
<9-25,RYAN>其实  你是有可能杀他的
<9-25,RYAN>Actually, you could have killed him.

324
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:07,680
<9-26,ESPOSITO>是啊
<9-26,ESPOSITO>Yeah.

325
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:09,380
<9-27,NED>等等  3:27
<9-27,NED>Wait. 3:27?

326
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,990
<9-29,NED>不不  我不可能杀了他
<9-29,NED>No, no, no. I could not have killed him,

327
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,250
<9-29,NED>因为我当时已经搭上顺风车了
<9-29,NED>because I was in a Hytch ride by then.

328
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:17,640
<9-29,NED>瞧  司机3:19接我走的
<9-29,NED>See? Driver picked me up at 3:19 a.m.

329
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,800
<10-1,HAYLEY>你好  奈德  我们聊聊吧
<10-1,HAYLEY>Hello, Neddie. Let's have a chat, shall we?

330
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,420
<10-2,NED>你是警察吗
<10-2,NED>Are you a cop?

331
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,570
<10-2,NED>那个警探说我可以走了
<10-2,NED>The other detective said I was free to go!

332
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,220
<10-3,HAYLEY>还没呢
<10-3,HAYLEY>Not quite.

333
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,160
<10-4,NED>好吧
<10-4,NED>Okay, okay, okay!

334
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,580
<10-5,NED>好  我会的  好
<10-5,NED>Yes, yes, I will. Yes!

335
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:47,660
<10-6,BECKETT>怎么回事
<10-6,BECKETT>What the hell is going on in here?

336
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:51,090
<10-7,HAYLEY>这位先生要修改他的供述
<10-7,HAYLEY>Well, this gentleman would like to revise his statement.

337
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,710
<10-7,HAYLEY>是的  我想修改我的供述
<10-7,HAYLEY>Yes, I'd like to revise my statement.

338
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,580
<10-8,NED>我不是一个人在办公室
<10-8,NED>I was not alone in my office.

339
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:00,210
<10-8,NED>大概凌晨2点  在一家酒吧
<10-8,NED>Uh, about 2:00 a.m., in a bar,

340
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:04,050
<10-8,NED>我遇见了一个美得冒泡的金发妞
<10-8,NED>I met a smoking-hot blond chick.

341
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:08,130
<10-9,NED>她是位年轻可爱的女士  叫卡拉
<10-9,NED>Who -- She's a very lovely young lady named Karla,

342
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:11,510
<10-9,NED>我们一拍即合  于是我把她带回了我的办公室
<10-9,NED>and we hit it off, so I took her back to my office.

343
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:13,270
<10-10,BECKETT>你为什么对我的警探撒谎
<10-10,BECKETT>So, why did you lie to my detectives?

344
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,250
<10-11,HAYLEY>因为这样的安全疏漏
<10-11,HAYLEY>Because a security breach like this

345
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,390
<10-11,HAYLEY>会害淫荡奈德被解雇
<10-11,HAYLEY>could get nasty Ned here fired.

346
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,890
<10-11,HAYLEY>说啊  告诉好警监你做了什么
<10-11,HAYLEY>Go on, tell the nice captain what you did.

347
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,840
<10-12,NED>我想让卡拉觉得我了不起
<10-12,NED>I was trying to impress Karla,

348
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,190
<10-12,NED>所以
<10-12,NED>so I...

349
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,100
<10-13,NED>我登录进了公司的封闭服务器
<10-13,NED>I logged into the company's closed server,

350
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:31,810
<10-13,NED>然后给唐宁街10号断了一会儿电
<10-13,NED>and I shut down the power at 10 Downing Street for a second.

351
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,210
<10-14,NED>但没成功
<10-14,NED>It didn't work, though.

352
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:35,640
<10-14,NED>我们都没做爱
<10-14,NED>We didn't have sex or nothing.

353
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,290
<10-15,BECKETT>令人震惊
<10-15,BECKETT>Shocking.

354
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:39,480
<10-16,NED>不  她本来对我很热情
<10-16,NED>No. She was very frisky with me.

355
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,550
<10-16,NED>然后  突然
<10-16,NED>And, then, all of a sudden,

356
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:42,680
<10-16,NED>她就说自己烦了  想回家
<10-16,NED>she said she was bored, wanted to go home.

357
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:43,980
<10-17,BECKETT>为什么
<10-17,BECKETT>Why?

358
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,450
<10-18,NED>我觉得可能是因为
<10-18,NED>I think maybe it was because

359
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:48,040
<10-18,NED>我当时解不开她的束胸
<10-18,NED>I was having trouble undoing her corset.

360
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,790
<10-18,NED>我要为自己说一句  那东西特别复杂
<10-18,NED>In my defense, it was, like, crazy-complicated,

361
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,780
<10-18,NED>我...
<10-18,NED>and -- and -- and I was -- I was --

362
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,030
<10-18,NED>我又很紧张
<10-18,NED>I was very nervous.

363
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:57,690
<10-19,HAYLEY>所以你是登录上电脑后卡拉才离开的吗
<10-19,HAYLEY>So after you logged on to your computer is when Karla left you?

364
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:59,060
<10-20,NED>是的  就我所知
<10-20,NED>Yes. And as far as I know,

365
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,960
<10-20,NED>我离开时办公室里可没人
<10-20,NED>the office was completely empty when I left.

366
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:04,220
<10-21,BECKETT>你看到卡拉离开大楼了吗
<10-21,BECKETT>Did you actually see Karla leave the building?

367
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:06,290
<10-22,NED>没有
<10-22,NED>N-No.

368
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:10,060
<10-23,BECKETT>那么她可能藏了起来  等到你离开吗
<10-23,BECKETT>So it's possible she hid and then waited until you left?

369
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,570
<11-1,BECKETT>莱恩  奈德要修改他的供述
<11-1,BECKETT>Hey, Ryan, Ned here wants to revise his statement.

370
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:20,470
<11-2,RYAN>太棒了  出了点事故吗
<11-2,RYAN>Awesome. Had a little accident?

371
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:21,840
<11-2,RYAN>什么都别碰
<11-2,RYAN>Don't touch anything, please.

372
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:23,310
<11-3,BECKETT>等等  海莉
<11-3,BECKETT>Uh, excuse me, Hayley.

373
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:24,610
<11-3,BECKETT>你要去哪
<11-3,BECKETT>Where are you going?

374
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,570
<11-4,CASTLE>各位  有什么问题吗
<11-4,CASTLE>Hey, guys. Is there a problem here?

375
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:29,400
<11-5,BECKETT>海莉给奈德上了水刑
<11-5,BECKETT>Hayley waterboarded Ned.

376
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,920
<11-6,HAYLEY>我才没有  就是马桶冲头而已
<11-6,HAYLEY>I did no such thing. It was more of a swirly.

377
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:32,610
<11-6,HAYLEY>算了
<11-6,HAYLEY>Never mind.

378
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:34,680
<11-7,BECKETT>显然  奈德被一个
<11-7,BECKETT>Look, apparently, Ned was tricked

379
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:36,010
<11-7,BECKETT>叫卡拉的女人骗了
<11-7,BECKETT>by some woman named Karla

380
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:38,240
<11-7,BECKETT>让她进入了大楼
<11-7,BECKETT>into gaining access to the building

381
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,260
<11-7,BECKETT>还得以使用一台安全服务器
<11-7,BECKETT>and the secured server,

382
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,560
<11-7,BECKETT>很可能是为帮马库斯抢劫那里
<11-7,BECKETT>most likely to help Marcus rob the place.

383
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,130
<11-8,HAYLEY>是啊  但马库斯和卡拉之间
<11-8,HAYLEY>Yeah, but clearly something happened

384
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:44,440
<11-8,HAYLEY>显然是出了什么事
<11-8,HAYLEY>between Marcus and Karla,

385
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,690
<11-8,HAYLEY>因为看来是她
<11-8,HAYLEY>because it looks like she's the one

386
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:47,390
<11-8,HAYLEY>把刀捅进了他的背后
<11-8,HAYLEY>that drove that knife into his back.

387
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:48,760
<11-9,CASTLE>就这样吗
<11-9,CASTLE>And is that all?

388
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,260
<11-10,HAYLEY>你问我做什么
<11-10,HAYLEY>Why are you asking me?

389
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,750
<11-11,CASTLE>因为你显然不太对劲  海莉
<11-11,CASTLE>Because clearly something is going on with you, Hayley --

390
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,740
<11-11,CASTLE>跟此案有关
<11-11,CASTLE>something connected to this case.

391
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:56,910
<11-11,CASTLE>你可以告诉我们的
<11-11,CASTLE>You know, you can tell us.

392
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:02,600
<11-12,HAYLEY>我昨晚也在那个办公室
<11-12,HAYLEY>I was in that office last night.

393
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,770
<11-13,BECKETT>好吧  我们得谈谈了
<11-13,BECKETT>Okay, we need to talk now.

394
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,060
<12-1,HAYLEY>不是吧  你想在这儿谈
<12-1,HAYLEY>Really? You want to talk in here?

395
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,260
<12-2,BECKETT>是的  我们都在这里审讯凶案嫌犯
<12-2,BECKETT>Yes. This is where we question all of our murder suspects.

396
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,280
<12-3,HAYLEY>你觉得我杀了马库斯
<12-3,HAYLEY>You think I killed Marcus.

397
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,140
<12-4,BECKETT>现在  我不知道该怎么想
<12-4,BECKETT>Right now, I don't know what to think.

398
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:27,090
<12-5,HAYLEY>我军情六处一个老朋友  布莱斯·罗伯茨
<12-5,HAYLEY>An old friend of mine from MI6, Bryce Roberts,

399
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,370
<12-5,HAYLEY>雇了我和马库斯执行私家侦探任务
<12-5,HAYLEY>hired me and Marcus to do some P.I. work,

400
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,400
<12-5,HAYLEY>向曼彻斯特能源公司
<12-5,HAYLEY>to install some spy software

401
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,420
<12-5,HAYLEY>副总的电脑上安装间谍软件
<12-5,HAYLEY>on the VP of Manchester Energy's computer.

402
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:34,680
<12-5,HAYLEY>至少  我以为是那么回事
<12-5,HAYLEY>At least, that's what I thought we were doing.

403
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,390
<12-5,HAYLEY>而我们干到一半  奈德和卡拉走了进来
<12-5,HAYLEY>Right in the middle of it all, in walked Ned and Karla,

404
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:40,180
<12-5,HAYLEY>于是我干完了我该干的  就走了
<12-5,HAYLEY>so I finished my part of the job, and I took off.

405
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,900
<12-5,HAYLEY>马库斯留了下来  想看奈德和卡拉干柴烈火
<12-5,HAYLEY>Marcus stayed to watch Ned and Karla go at it.

406
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,850
<12-5,HAYLEY>那肯定是他们计划好的
<12-5,HAYLEY>Must have been part of their plan.

407
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:46,630
<12-6,BECKETT>等等  马库斯和卡拉是搭档吗
<12-6,BECKETT>Wait a minute. Marcus and Karla were partners?

408
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:47,460
<12-7,HAYLEY>肯定是的
<12-7,HAYLEY>Must have been.

409
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:49,690
<12-7,HAYLEY>但他们究竟想要什么  以及她为何下杀手
<12-7,HAYLEY>Although what they were really after and why she killed him,

410
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:51,720
<12-7,HAYLEY>我就不知道了
<12-7,HAYLEY>I have no bloody idea.

411
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:54,710
<12-8,BECKETT>好吧  跟我说说布莱斯
<12-8,BECKETT>Okay. Tell me about Bryce.

412
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:57,450
<12-9,HAYLEY>我为军情六处做兼职时  他是我的领队
<12-9,HAYLEY>He was my team leader back when I freelanced for MI6.

413
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:58,770
<12-10,BECKETT>你们关系好吗
<12-10,BECKETT>Were you guys close?

414
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:00,190
<12-11,HAYLEY>是的  有一阵吧
<12-11,HAYLEY>Yeah, for a while.

415
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:01,700
<12-11,HAYLEY>然后一次行动中  出了大岔子
<12-11,HAYLEY>Then everything went to hell in an op,

416
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,430
<12-11,HAYLEY>我就跟军情六处彻底告别了
<12-11,HAYLEY>and I cut all ties with MI6.

417
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:04,960
<12-11,HAYLEY>几个月前
<12-11,HAYLEY>Then, a few months ago,

418
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,970
<12-11,HAYLEY>他退休了
<12-11,HAYLEY>he retired from Her Majesty's service,

419
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:09,600
<12-11,HAYLEY>在纽约建立了一家自由安保公司
<12-11,HAYLEY>started a freelance security company here in New York.

420
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,040
<12-11,HAYLEY>又跟我联络上了
<12-11,HAYLEY>He got back in touch.

421
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:14,360
<12-11,HAYLEY>他是个好人
<12-11,HAYLEY>He's a good man.

422
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,380
<12-12,BECKETT>那他为什么要叫上你
<12-12,BECKETT>So, why did he involve you?

423
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,600
<12-13,HAYLEY>是啊  我也想问呢
<12-13,HAYLEY>Yeah, I'd like to ask him that myself.

424
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:20,220
<12-14,BECKETT>知道我们能在哪找到他吗
<12-14,BECKETT>Any idea where we can find him?

425
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,130
<13-1,ESPOSITO>你确定布莱斯的前妻还住这里吗
<13-1,ESPOSITO>Are you sure Bryce's ex-wife still lives here?

426
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,110
<13-2,HAYLEY>希望是
<13-2,HAYLEY>I hope so.

427
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:29,360
<13-2,HAYLEY>他消失之前应该
<13-2,HAYLEY>He would have come to say goodbye

428
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,030
<13-2,HAYLEY>会来道个别
<13-2,HAYLEY>before he went Code 44.

429
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:31,890
<13-3,CASTLE>这里没车
<13-3,CASTLE>There's no cars here.

430
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:33,430
<13-3,CASTLE>看上去没人
<13-3,CASTLE>It doesn't look like anybody's --

431
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:38,290
<14-1,RYAN>警察
<14-1,RYAN>Police!

432
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,630

<14-5,HAYLEY>Bryce?

436
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:58,580
<15-1,HAYLEY>背后中刀  跟马库斯一样
<15-1,HAYLEY>Stabbed in the back, just like Marcus.

437
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:01,660
<15-2,LANIE>T4和T5椎骨之间
<15-2,LANIE>Right between the T4 and T5 vertebrae.

438
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,790
<15-2,LANIE>我看不是巧合
<15-2,LANIE>I don't believe it's coincidence.

<15-2,LANIE>节哀顺变

<15-4,CASTLE>你不能自责
<15-4,CASTLE>You know, you can't blame yourself for this.

442
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,140
<15-4,CASTLE>布莱斯撒谎了  他骗了你
<15-4,CASTLE>Bryce lied. He chose to trick you.

443
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,620
<15-5,HAYLEY>布莱斯受了胁迫
<15-5,HAYLEY>Bryce was leveraged, compromised.

444
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,980
<15-6,CASTLE>被谁呢
<15-6,CASTLE>Yeah, but by whom?

445
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,460
<15-6,CASTLE>他们究竟把你搅进了什么里
<15-6,CASTLE>Hey, what are they getting you mixed up in?

446
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,720
<15-7,ESPOSITO>警员在这一带进行排查
<15-7,ESPOSITO>Yo, some unis are canvassing the neighborhood,

<15-7,ESPOSITO>但没有嫌疑人的痕迹
<15-7,ESPOSITO>but there's no trace of our suspect.

448
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:25,260
<15-8,HAYLEY>肯定是卡拉
<15-8,HAYLEY>It had to be Karla.

449
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,570
<15-9,RYAN>或许她在收尾
<15-9,RYAN>Could be she's cleaning up loose ends.

450
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:27,680
<15-9,RYAN>她的搭档都死了

00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,450
<15-9,RYAN>卡拉现在只需要消失了
<15-9,RYAN>All Karla has to do now is disappear.

452
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,130
<15-10,CASTLE>她为什么要闯入曼彻斯特能源大楼呢
<15-10,CASTLE>Why would she break into Manchester Energy building in the first place?

453
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:32,900
<15-10,CASTLE>他们想要什么
<15-10,CASTLE>What were they after?

454
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,070
<15-10,CASTLE>他们为什么要扯上海莉呢
<15-10,CASTLE>And why do they need Hayley to be a part of it?

<15-17,TV REPORTER>they're able to restore full power to the city's grid.

472
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:15,580
<16-1,HAYLEY>我以为布莱斯说的是实话呢
<16-1,HAYLEY>I just assumed that Bryce was telling the truth.

473
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,440
<16-1,HAYLEY>我怎么能那么蠢
<16-1,HAYLEY>How could I have been so stupid?!

474
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,060
<16-2,CASTLE>布莱斯给了你一个U盘  是吧
<16-2,CASTLE>It was a thumb drive Bryce gave you, wasn't it?

475
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:21,850
<16-3,HAYLEY>天呐  那肯定是个病毒
<16-3,HAYLEY>Oh, God. I must have had a virus of some sort.

<16-4,BECKETT>我联络了联调局
<16-4,BECKETT>So, I spoke with the FBI,

477
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:26,810
<16-4,BECKETT>他们将此举视为恐怖袭击
<16-4,BECKETT>and they are considering this an act of terror.

478
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:29,950
<16-5,HAYLEY>损害多严重
<16-5,HAYLEY>How bad's the damage?

479
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,140
<16-6,BECKETT>伦敦可能要
<16-6,BECKETT>Uh, it's gonna be a few days

480
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:34,010
<16-6,BECKETT>好几天甚至更久才能恢复电力
<16-6,BECKETT>before the power's back up in London, maybe more.

481
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:36,440
<16-7,HAYLEY>太好了  那么我有意将我的家乡
<16-7,HAYLEY>Fantastic. So I have unwittingly plunged my hometown

482
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,760
<16-7,HAYLEY>送回了16世纪
<16-7,HAYLEY>back into the 16th century.

483
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,160
<16-8,CASTLE>这可能不完全是坏事
<16-8,CASTLE>Oh, that might not be all that bad.

484
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,850
<16-8,CASTLE>《哈姆雷特》就是16世纪时写就的
<16-8,CASTLE>I mean, Hamlet was written in the 16th century.

485
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,150
<16-8,CASTLE>我是在帮倒忙
<16-8,CASTLE>I'm not helping.

486
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,450
<16-9,HAYLEY>凯特  他们知道我也参与了吗
<16-9,HAYLEY>Kate, do they know about my involvement yet?

487
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,020
<16-10,BECKETT>他们追查到汇入你账户的钱了
<16-10,BECKETT>They traced the money to your account,

488
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,620
<16-10,BECKETT>现在有逮捕你的通缉令
<16-10,BECKETT>and there is a warrant out for your arrest.

489
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,420
<16-10,BECKETT>打扰
<16-10,BECKETT>Excuse me.

490
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:54,810
<16-11,RYAN>海莉  这是卡拉吗
<16-11,RYAN>Hayley, uh, is this Karla?

491
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:57,460
<16-12,HAYLEY>是的  那是我们的老朋友奈德
<16-12,HAYLEY>Oh, yes, with our old friend Ned.

492
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,550
<16-13,RYAN>街对面的监控拍到了他们
<16-13,RYAN>Well, the security camera across the street caught them

493
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:01,280
<16-13,RYAN>离开这家酒吧  去往办公室
<16-13,RYAN>leaving this bar on their way to the office.

494
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,220
<16-13,RYAN>酒保记得卡拉
<16-13,RYAN>The bartender remembers Karla,

495
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,890
<16-13,RYAN>但那晚之前他从未见过她
<16-13,RYAN>but he'd never seen her before that night,

496
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:06,670
<16-13,RYAN>不幸的是  是奈德付了账
<16-13,RYAN>and unfortunately, Ned paid the bill.

497
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:08,650
<16-14,HAYLEY>-那么我们无法找她  -我们在彻查
<16-14,HAYLEY>- So we have no way to track her. - Well, we're scrubbing

498
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:10,940
<16-15,RYAN>布莱斯和马库斯的电脑和手机
<16-15,RYAN>Bryce and Marcus' computers and cellphones.

499
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,900
<16-15,RYAN>他们其中一位肯定跟她有联络
<16-15,RYAN>One of them had to have been in contact with her.

500
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,440
<16-15,RYAN>别担心  我们会找到她的
<16-15,RYAN>Don't worry. We'll find her.

501
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:16,420
<16-16,BECKETT>听着  我们会有事通知你
<16-16,BECKETT>Look, we'll keep you in the loop,

502
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,830
<16-16,BECKETT>但警局大概是最不合适
<16-16,BECKETT>but a police precinct is probably the worst place

503
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:19,800
<16-16,BECKETT>躲避联调局的地方了
<16-16,BECKETT>to hide from the feds.

504
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,310
<16-17,CASTLE>我们可以回私家侦探社
<16-17,CASTLE>Well, we can go back to the P.I. office.

505
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:23,420
<16-17,CASTLE>你可以躲在应急室
<16-17,CASTLE>You can stay out of sight in the panic room

506
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,310
<16-17,CASTLE>直到我们帮你洗脱罪名
<16-17,CASTLE>until we clear your name.

507
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:25,930
<16-18,HAYLEY>不行  我不能让你们给我打掩护
<16-18,HAYLEY>No. I can't let you guys cover for me.

508
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:27,680
<16-19,BECKETT>不  我们会罩你的
<16-19,BECKETT>No, we got your back.

509
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,810
<16-19,BECKETT>走吧
<16-19,BECKETT>Just go.

510
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,090
<16-20,CASTLE>有多糟糕
<16-20,CASTLE>So, how bad is it?

511
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:40,330
<16-21,BECKETT>她要能脱罪  那真是奇迹
<16-21,BECKETT>She's gonna need a miracle to stay out of jail.

512
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,270
<17-1,HAYLEY>我要是记得她的什么特征就好了
<17-1,HAYLEY>I wish I remembered something about her --

513
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:51,490
<17-1,HAYLEY>纹身  伤疤
<17-1,HAYLEY>a tattoo, a scar.

514
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:54,320
<17-1,HAYLEY>说来好笑
<17-1,HAYLEY>You want a laugh?

515
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:55,970
<17-1,HAYLEY>我唯一记得关于这女人的
<17-1,HAYLEY>The only thing I recall about this woman

516
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:58,940
<17-1,HAYLEY>就是可怜的奈德怎么也解不开她的束胸
<17-1,HAYLEY>is poor Ned fumbling around with her fancy corset.

517
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:13,400
<17-1,HAYLEY>最新美剧下载
<17-1,HAYLEY>www.ZiMuZu.tv

518
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,420
<17-2,CASTLE>继续说  是棉的还是蕾丝的
<17-2,CASTLE>Tell me more. Was it cotton or lace?

519
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:04,860
<17-4,HAYLEY>真变态
<17-4,HAYLEY>Perv much?

520
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,180
<17-5,CASTLE>我是认真的
<17-5,CASTLE>I'm serious.

521
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,080
<17-6,HAYLEY>好吧  是镶着黑色皮革的蕾丝  怎么了
<17-6,HAYLEY>Okay, it was lace with black leather. Why?

522
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,630
<17-7,CASTLE>缩小了范围  有填充吗
<17-7,CASTLE>Narrows it down. Padded?

523
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:11,330
<17-8,HAYLEY>没有
<17-8,HAYLEY>No.

524
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,290
<17-9,CASTLE>挂扣在前面还是后面
<17-9,CASTLE>Back or front clasps?

525
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:14,790
<17-10,HAYLEY>在后面
<17-10,HAYLEY>Back clasps and buckles,

533
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:17,110
<17-10,HAYLEY>前面纽扣上有一个金属环
<17-10,HAYLEY>and it had a metal ring in the front with snaps.

541
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,150
<17-11,CASTLE>束胸上有水晶钻吗
<17-11,CASTLE>Were there crystal studs across the decolletage?

542
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,370
<17-12,HAYLEY>还真有
<17-12,HAYLEY>Actually, yes.

543
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,150
<17-13,CASTLE>诱惑内衣
<17-13,CASTLE>La Seductrice.

544
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:26,210
<17-13,CASTLE>我找一下2016年"我亲爱的"产品集
<17-13,CASTLE>Give me a moment to pull up the 2016 Mon Cheri collection.

545
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,980
<17-14,HAYLEY>就是这种  就是这种
<17-14,HAYLEY>That's it. That's the one.

546
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:30,100
<17-15,CASTLE>瞧吧  任务完成
<17-15,CASTLE>And voila. My work here is done.

547
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:33,020
<17-16,ALEXIS>老爸  我是不是该问一下
<17-16,ALEXIS>Hey, dad should I even ask?

548
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,760
<17-17,CASTLE>-是为了《妮奇·希特》做的调查  -好吧
<17-17,CASTLE>- "Nikki Heat" research. - Yeah.

549
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:37,110
<17-18,ALEXIS>诱惑内衣在纽约只有一家分店
<17-18,ALEXIS>Well, there's only one La Seductrice in New York.

550
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,890
<17-19,CASTLE>我把这个发给埃斯波和莱恩
<17-19,CASTLE>I will e-mail this to Espo and Ryan,

551
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:42,390
<17-19,CASTLE>看看他们能不能通过束胸衣找到她
<17-19,CASTLE>see if they can track her down by her unmentionables.

552
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:46,990
<17-20,HAYLEY>该死
<17-20,HAYLEY>Oh, damn it.

553
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:49,260
<17-20,HAYLEY>我认识他  他是军情六处的
<17-20,HAYLEY>I recognize him. He's MI6.

554
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:53,000
<17-21,CASTLE>看来不光是联邦调查局在查这事
<17-21,CASTLE>I guess the FBI aren't the only ones investigating.

555
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,750
<17-21,CASTLE>-你们去应急室躲躲  -好的
<17-21,CASTLE>- You guys get in the panic room. - Yeah.

556
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,610
<17-23,MALLORY>你好  卡塞尔先生  我是史蒂芬·马洛里
<17-23,MALLORY>Hello, Mr. Castle. The name's Stephen Mallory.

557
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,610
<17-24,CASTLE>是军情六处的马洛里探员吧
<17-24,CASTLE>Do you mean Agent Mallory, MI6?

558
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:03,150
<17-25,MALLORY>你怎么知道
<17-25,MALLORY>Well, I wonder how you knew that.

559
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:04,660
<17-26,CASTLE>瞎猜的  请进
<17-26,CASTLE>Lucky guess. Do come in.

560
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,600
<17-27,MALLORY>装修不错
<17-27,MALLORY>Lovely decor.

561
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:09,890
<17-27,MALLORY>复古又不失时尚
<17-27,MALLORY>Retro but chic.

562
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:10,890
<17-27,MALLORY>谢谢
<17-27,MALLORY>Thank you.

563
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:12,810
<17-28,CASTLE>但我想英国特工来这
<17-28,CASTLE>But I assume Her Majesty's Secret Service

564
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:15,190
<17-28,CASTLE>不会是对我的装修感兴趣吧
<17-28,CASTLE>isn't interested in my interior designer.

565
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:19,280
<17-29,MALLORY>当然不是  不过我们对你的生意伙伴挺感兴趣
<17-29,MALLORY>No. However, your business partner interests us greatly.

566
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,740
<17-30,CASTLE>我从今天上午就没见过海莉了
<17-30,CASTLE>Ah, well, I haven't seen Hayley since this morning.

567
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:25,990
<17-30,CASTLE>卡塞尔先生
<17-30,CASTLE>Mr. Castle,

568
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:29,180
<17-31,MALLORY>我必须尽快找到希普顿女士
<17-31,MALLORY>I must find Ms. Shipton before it's too late,

569
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:31,130
<17-31,MALLORY>否则我就帮不了她了
<17-31,MALLORY>before I can no longer help her.

570
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:32,840
<17-32,CASTLE>海莉离开军情六处是有原因的
<17-32,CASTLE>Well, Hayley left MI6 for a reason.

571
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,710
<17-32,CASTLE>我想她不需要你的帮助  马洛里探员
<17-32,CASTLE>I doubt she needs your kind of help, Agent Mallory.

572
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:36,210
<17-33,MALLORY>你可能认为自己了解希普顿女士
<17-33,MALLORY>You may think you know Ms. Shipton,

573
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:37,620
<17-33,MALLORY>但其实你不了解
<17-33,MALLORY>but, in fact, you do not.

574
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,730
<17-34,CASTLE>装得可像那么回事
<17-34,CASTLE>You could have fooled me.

575
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:39,770
<17-35,MALLORY>她肯定是骗了你
<17-35,MALLORY>I'm sure she has.

576
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:42,060
<17-35,MALLORY>告诉我
<17-35,MALLORY>Tell me,

577
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,860
<17-35,MALLORY>希普顿女士告诉过你她为什么离开军情六处吗
<17-35,MALLORY>did Ms. Shipton ever tell you why she left MI6?

578
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:48,110
<17-36,CASTLE>节日奖金太少  炸鱼薯条不好吃之类的
<17-36,CASTLE>Something about holiday bonuses and bad fish and chips.

579
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:48,970
<17-37,MALLORY>真风趣
<17-37,MALLORY>Charming.

580
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:50,400
<17-38,CASTLE>无论你怎么想
<17-38,CASTLE>Look, despite what you think,

581
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,340
<17-38,CASTLE>我敢肯定海莉是被陷害的
<17-38,CASTLE>I can assure you Hayley was framed.

582
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:55,090
<17-39,MALLORY>我也敢肯定  她就是今天
<17-39,MALLORY>And I can assure you - she is the main conspirator

583
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:57,020
<17-39,MALLORY>一切事情的主谋
<17-39,MALLORY>in everything that happened today.

584
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,110
<17-40,CASTLE>你怎么能这么确定
<17-40,CASTLE>How can you be so sure about that?

585
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:01,270
<17-41,MALLORY>我能看到她的机密档案
<17-41,MALLORY>I have access to her confidential dossiers,

586
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,310
<17-41,MALLORY>卡塞尔先生
<17-41,MALLORY>Mr. Castle.

587
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,060
<17-41,MALLORY>你一定要相信我
<17-41,MALLORY>You must trust me --

588
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,150
<17-41,MALLORY>希普顿女士策划并执行了
<17-41,MALLORY>Ms. Shipton is intimately involved

589
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:09,540
<17-41,MALLORY>今天的事情  她跟这事关系密切
<17-41,MALLORY>in the planning and the execution of today's events.

590
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:10,480
<17-41,MALLORY>我们有证据
<17-41,MALLORY>We have proof.

591
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,520
<17-42,HAYLEY>别信他的  他所说的
<17-42,HAYLEY>Ignore him. Everything he's saying

592
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,570
<17-42,HAYLEY>都是干情报的惯用伎俩
<17-42,HAYLEY>is classic counterintelligence.

593
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:16,540
<17-43,MALLORY>希普顿女士可以说是
<17-43,MALLORY>Ms. Shipton was arguably

594
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:19,320
<17-43,MALLORY>军情六处历史上最残忍  最冷酷的
<17-43,MALLORY>one of the most ruthless, cold-hearted operatives

595
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,970
<17-43,MALLORY>特工之一
<17-43,MALLORY>in the history of MI6.

596
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,370
<17-43,MALLORY>说实话  在她最后一次行动中
<17-43,MALLORY>Truth be told, on her final mission,

597
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:25,890
<17-43,MALLORY>她为了救自己  而不顾搭档的死活
<17-43,MALLORY>to save her own skin, she let her own partner die.

598
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:28,010
<17-44,MALLORY>我想这已经能够说明
<17-44,MALLORY>I think that would be an indication

599
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:30,150
<17-44,MALLORY>你是在跟什么样的人打交道
<17-44,MALLORY>of exactly the type of person you're dealing with.

600
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:33,210
<17-45,MALLORY>她可能也会这么对你
<17-45,MALLORY>She might very well do the same to you...

601
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:39,420
<17-46,MALLORY>或者对你的女儿
<17-46,MALLORY>or to your daughter.

602
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,430
<17-47,CASTLE>我已经说过了  马洛里探员
<17-47,CASTLE>Well, as I said, Agent Mallory,

603
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:48,230
<17-47,CASTLE>我真的不知道海莉现在在哪
<17-47,CASTLE>as far as where Hayley is, I haven't got a clue.

604
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:52,780
<17-48,MALLORY>如果你有线索

<17-49,CASTLE>为什么说军情六处有你参与的证据
<17-49,CASTLE>What was all that about MI6 having proof you're behind this?

607
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,540
<17-50,HAYLEY>都是骗人的
<17-50,HAYLEY>It's all lies.

608
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:13,410
<17-51,ALEXIS>难道他说你搭档的事也是假的吗
<17-51,ALEXIS>Even what he said about your old partner?

609
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,700
<17-51,ALEXIS>那也是骗人的吗
<17-51,ALEXIS>That was a lie, too?

610
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:20,610
<17-52,ALEXIS>你真的不顾搭档的死活
<17-52,ALEXIS>You let your partner die.

611
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:24,080
<17-53,HAYLEY>没有  韦斯利的死是因为
<17-53,HAYLEY>No. Wesley died because...

612
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:31,320
<17-53,HAYLEY>因为...  一言难尽

642
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:40,590
<18-8,BETH>不  你们不能抓我
<18-8,BETH>No, no, no. You are not hanging this on me.

643
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:41,680
<18-8,BETH>我没杀人
<18-8,BETH>I didn't kill anyone.

644
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:44,130
<18-8,BETH>我离开曼特斯特能源时  马库斯还活着
<18-8,BETH>When I left Manchester Energy, Marcus was alive.

645
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:45,210
<18-8,BETH>之后我就直接回到这里了
<18-8,BETH>I came straight back here.

646
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,330
<18-8,BETH>你们可以去查旅馆监控录像
<18-8,BETH>You can check - the motel surveillance cameras.

647
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:48,260
<18-9,HAYLEY>那布莱斯呢
<18-9,HAYLEY>And what about Bryce?

648
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:50,750
<18-10,BETH>我没杀他  我当时在这里
<18-10,BETH>I didn't kill him. I was here.

649
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,780
<18-10,BETH>我至今都没离开过这里
<18-10,BETH>I haven't even left this place till now.

650
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:55,510
<18-11,CASTLE>那昨晚到底发生什么事了
<18-11,CASTLE>Okay, then what really happened last night?

651
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:56,570
<18-11,CASTLE>海莉和马库斯闯进去的时候
<18-11,CASTLE>What were you doing there

652
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:58,210
<18-11,CASTLE>你在做什么
<18-11,CASTLE>when Hayley and Marcus were breaking in?

653
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:03,290
<18-12,BETH>我是那个蠢货奈德的诱饵
<18-12,BETH>I was the bait for that idiot Ned.

654
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:05,520
<18-12,BETH>必须有两个不同的安全码
<18-12,BETH>The computer system required

655
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,460
<18-12,BETH>才能登录那个电脑系统
<18-12,BETH>two separate security keys.

656
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:09,780
<18-12,BETH>我们无法直接侵入电脑去上传病毒
<18-12,BETH>You can't just hack in and upload a worm.

657
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:12,640
<18-12,BETH>植入病毒的前提是安全入口开放着
<18-12,BETH>It had to be embedded while a secure portal was open.

658
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,300
<18-13,ESPOSITO>所以你得让奈德登录电脑
<18-13,ESPOSITO>So you made sure that Ned logged in.

659
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:17,160
<18-14,RYAN>之后  海莉无意中植入的病毒
<18-14,RYAN>And after that, the worm that Hayley unintentionally planted

660
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,620
<18-14,RYAN>就能大肆破坏伦敦市电网了
<18-14,RYAN>was allowed to wreak havoc on London's power grid.

661
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:23,230
<18-15,CASTLE>等等  马库斯充其量是个普通的小毛贼
<18-15,CASTLE>Wait a minute. Marcus was a run-of-the-mill cat burglar at best.

662
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:25,320
<18-15,CASTLE>他怎么可能想出这么精密的计划
<18-15,CASTLE>How would he come up with such an elaborate plan?

663
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,850
<18-16,BETH>他只是在执行命令
<18-16,BETH>He was just following orders.

664
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:27,880
<18-17,HAYLEY>谁的命令
<18-17,HAYLEY>From who?

665
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,150
<18-18,BETH>一个叫埃德加·帕顿的人
<18-18,BETH>A man named Edgar Patton.

666
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:33,740
<18-19,ESPOSITO>-你从没见过这个人吗  -没见过
<18-19,ESPOSITO>- You never met this man? - No.

667
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:35,090
<18-20,BETH>马库斯是接头人
<18-20,BETH>Marcus was the point man,

668
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:36,620
<18-20,BETH>是他把我扯进这任务的
<18-20,BETH>and he brought me onto this job.

669
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:37,980
<18-21,RYAN>马库斯有提过他什么吗
<18-21,RYAN>Marcus say anything about him?

670
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:39,610
<18-21,RYAN>快点  你肯定知道点什么
<18-21,RYAN>Come on, you got to know something.

671
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,690
<18-22,BETH>他应该抽烟  我猜
<18-22,BETH>He's a smoker, I guess.

672
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,340
<18-22,BETH>行动开始前一晚
<18-22,BETH>The night before the job,

673
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:45,460
<18-22,BETH>马库斯在一家高级俱乐部和埃德加会面
<18-22,BETH>Marcus met Edgar at some fancy club

674
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:46,850
<18-22,BETH>拿到了病毒程序
<18-22,BETH>to get the worm program.

675
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:47,870
<18-22,BETH>马库斯回来时
<18-22,BETH>When Marcus came back,

676
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:50,050
<18-22,BETH>他和他的电脑都有很大的雪茄味
<18-22,BETH>both him and his laptop stunk like cigars,

677
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:50,850
<18-22,BETH>我只知道这些了
<18-22,BETH>and that's all I know.

678
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:52,460
<18-23,RYAN>马库斯的电脑现在在哪
<18-23,RYAN>Where's Marcus' laptop now?

679
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,140
<18-24,HAYLEY>如果这电脑里还有病毒程序的备份
<18-24,HAYLEY>Okay, if there's still a copy of the worm program on here,

680
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:01,980
<18-24,HAYLEY>我应该能查出这病毒是谁创建的
<18-24,HAYLEY>I might be able to find out who created it.

681
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,980
<18-25,CASTLE>等等  如果仅仅是为了破坏伦敦市电网
<18-25,CASTLE>Hold on. To attack London's power grid,

682
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:06,760
<18-25,CASTLE>根本都用不着海莉或布莱斯
<18-25,CASTLE>you didn't even need Hayley or Bryce.

683
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:10,460
<18-26,BETH>对  但埃德加要求马库斯必须如此
<18-26,BETH>No. But that's the way Edgar told Marcus it had to be.

684
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:13,050
<18-27,HAYLEY>我是被指定的
<18-27,HAYLEY>I was chosen specifically.

685
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:13,890
<18-27,HAYLEY>对
<18-27,HAYLEY>Yeah.

686
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,010
<18-28,BETH>你的好哥们布莱斯  只是被用来
<18-28,BETH>And your buddy Bryce was only leveraged to do this job

687
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,190
<18-28,BETH>引你入瓮的
<18-28,BETH>to get to you.

688
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:24,940
<19-1,ESPOSITO>卡拉没撒谎
<19-1,ESPOSITO>Our Karla's telling the truth.

689
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:26,390
<19-2,RYAN>旅馆监控录像证明了
<19-2,RYAN>Motel security cameras prove

690
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:28,250
<19-2,RYAN>布莱斯死时她在旅馆里
<19-2,RYAN>that she was there during Bryce's murder.

691
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:29,960
<19-3,ESPOSITO>蕾妮说布莱斯和马库斯
<19-3,ESPOSITO>Lanie says that both Bryce and Marcus

692
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,470
<19-3,ESPOSITO>是被同一个人杀的
<19-3,ESPOSITO>were stabbed by the same killer,

693
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:34,280
<19-3,ESPOSITO>所以这个埃德加是我们的新头号嫌犯
<19-3,ESPOSITO>so it looks like this Edgar guy is our new number-one suspect.

694
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,680
<19-4,BECKETT>抽雪茄的家伙有什么线索吗
<19-4,BECKETT>Any leads on the cigar smoker?

695
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,060
<19-5,RYAN>还没有  我们会检查全城的雪茄俱乐部
<19-5,RYAN>Not yet. We're gonna canvass smoking clubs throughout the city.

696
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:40,850
<19-6,ESPOSITO>走运的话 说不定有人见过马库斯和埃德加会面
<19-6,ESPOSITO>Yeah. If we're lucky, somebody saw Marcus and Edgar meeting.

697
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:42,330
<19-7,BECKETT>那台电脑呢
<19-7,BECKETT>And what about that laptop?

698
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:45,420
<19-7,BECKETT>海莉查出来病毒程序是谁创建的吗
<19-7,BECKETT>Was Hayley able to identify who created that worm program?

699
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:46,720
<19-8,RYAN>还没
<19-8,RYAN>Not yet.

700
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:55,570
<20-1,HAYLEY>该死
<20-1,HAYLEY>Damn it.

701
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:57,880
<20-2,ALEXIS>你都弄好几个小时了
<20-2,ALEXIS>You've been working that thing for hours.

702
00:27:58,050 --> 00:27:59,270
<20-2,ALEXIS>休息一下吧
<20-2,ALEXIS>You need to take a break.

703
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,020
<20-3,HAYLEY>这个埃德加肯定特别想致我于死地
<20-3,HAYLEY>Uh, this Edgar fellow has a serious hurt-on for me,

704
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,670
<20-3,HAYLEY>布莱斯也因此被连累死了
<20-3,HAYLEY>and he killed Bryce because of it.

705
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:05,970
<20-3,HAYLEY>那坏蛋不死我绝不休息
<20-3,HAYLEY>I'll take a break when that bastard is dead.

706
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:11,570
<20-3,HAYLEY>成功了
<20-3,HAYLEY>Hello. I'm in.

707
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:14,100
<20-3,HAYLEY>我破解了这病毒
<20-3,HAYLEY>I have unlocked the security for the worm.

708
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:18,120
<20-4,ALEXIS>怎么了
<20-4,ALEXIS>What is it?

709
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,840
<20-5,HAYLEY>我认得出这代码
<20-5,HAYLEY>I recognize this code.

710
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:21,440
<20-6,ALEXIS>你认识  怎么认识的
<20-6,ALEXIS>You do? How?

711
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:25,410
<20-7,HAYLEY>因为很久很久以前  我参与了它的设计
<20-7,HAYLEY>Because I helped design it a long, long time ago.

712
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:27,750
<20-8,ALEXIS>你说什么
<20-8,ALEXIS>W-What are you talking about?

713
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:31,270
<20-8,ALEXIS>该死
<20-8,ALEXIS>Damn it.

714
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:33,770
<20-9,HAYLEY>他电脑太垃圾了
<20-9,HAYLEY>His laptop is rubbish.

715
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:35,190
<20-9,HAYLEY>我需要一台更高配置的电脑
<20-9,HAYLEY>I'm gonna need something with more horsepower

716
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:36,930
<20-9,HAYLEY>来查个水落石出
<20-9,HAYLEY>in order to get to the bottom of this.

717
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:38,540
<20-10,ALEXIS>我去后面拿你的电脑过来
<20-10,ALEXIS>I'll get your laptop from the back.

718
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:39,950
<20-11,HAYLEY>你真好  谢啦
<20-11,HAYLEY>You're a dear. Thank you.

719
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:43,090
<20-12,ALEXIS>既然部分代码是你写的
<20-12,ALEXIS>Now, if it's partially your code,

720
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:46,270
<20-12,ALEXIS>应该能帮你缩小凶手的范围  对吧
<20-12,ALEXIS>then that should help narrow down who the killer is, right?

721
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,010
<20-13,ALEXIS>海莉
<20-13,ALEXIS>Hayley?

722
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,600
<20-13,ALEXIS>海莉
<20-13,ALEXIS>Hayley...

723
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,560
<20-13,ALEXIS>海莉
<20-13,ALEXIS>Hayley.

724
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,570
<21-1,RYAN>各位  我们有发现了
<21-1,RYAN>Hey, guys, we got something.

725
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:00,450
<21-2,ESPOSITO>是的  从一个雪茄俱乐部得到消息
<21-2,ESPOSITO>Yeah. One of those cigar clubs paid off.

726
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:02,450
<21-2,ESPOSITO>经理认出了马库斯的照片
<21-2,ESPOSITO>Manager recognized Marcus' photo.

727
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:03,780
<21-3,BECKETT>他看见马库斯和谁在一起了吗
<21-3,BECKETT>Did he see who Marcus was with?

728
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:05,030
<21-4,RYAN>他说马库斯是一个人去的
<21-4,RYAN>He said Marcus came in alone,

729
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:06,570
<21-4,RYAN>之后和一个穿棕色皮夹克的男子
<21-4,RYAN>and then he met with a guy in a brown leather jacket

730
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:07,500
<21-4,RYAN>大概聊了15分钟
<21-4,RYAN>for about 15 minutes.

731
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,500
<21-5,BECKETT>他看清楚那个人的样子了吗
<21-5,BECKETT>Did he get a good look at him?

732
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,120
<21-6,ESPOSITO>没有  但是俱乐部里的监控录像拍下来了
<21-6,ESPOSITO>No, but the club security cam did.

733
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,860
<21-6,ESPOSITO>你们看  棕色皮夹克  一定是埃德加
<21-6,ESPOSITO>Look -- brown leather jacket. Got to be Edgar.

734
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:16,360
<21-7,BECKETT>这人看着眼熟
<21-7,BECKETT>This guy looks familiar.

735
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,160
<21-7,BECKETT>等一下
<21-7,BECKETT>Hold on.

736
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:22,420
<21-8,CASTLE>阿丽克西斯
<21-8,CASTLE>Hey, Alexis.

737
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,500
<21-9,ALEXIS>爸爸  海莉跑了
<21-9,ALEXIS>Dad, Hayley's gone.

738
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:24,980
<21-10,CASTLE>跑哪里去了
<21-10,CASTLE>Gone where?

739
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,420
<21-11,ALEXIS>我不知道  她扔了手机
<21-11,ALEXIS>I don't know, but she ditched her cellphone.

740
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:27,470
<21-11,ALEXIS>我找不到她
<21-11,ALEXIS>I can't track her.

741
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:28,890
<21-12,CASTLE>等一下  我开免提
<21-12,CASTLE>Hang on. I'm putting you on speaker.

742
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,190
<21-12,CASTLE>海莉失踪之前
<21-12,CASTLE>What was the last thing

743
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,380
<21-12,CASTLE>做的最后一件事情是什么
<21-12,CASTLE>Hayley did before she disappeared?

744
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,830
<21-13,ALEXIS>她发现那个病毒
<21-13,ALEXIS>She discovered the computer worm

745
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:34,700
<21-13,ALEXIS>是多年前她帮忙设计的
<21-13,ALEXIS>was one she helped design years ago.

746
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:37,560
<21-14,CASTLE>所以埃德加用海莉自己的代码来陷害她
<21-14,CASTLE>So Edgar used Hayley's own code to help frame her.

747
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,370
<21-15,RYAN>她为什么要在真相大白时离开
<21-15,RYAN>Why did she take off right when she was closing in?

748
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:40,940
<21-16,BECKETT>因为她知道凶手是谁
<21-16,BECKETT>Because she knows who the killer is,

749
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:43,200
<21-16,BECKETT>而且不叫埃德加
<21-16,BECKETT>and his name isn't Edgar.

750
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:48,140
<21-16,BECKETT>我调查了她去世的前搭档  韦斯利·康纳斯
<21-16,BECKETT>I did some research on her dead MI6 partner, Wesley Connors,

751
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:50,340
<21-16,BECKETT>发现了这篇六年前的文章
<21-16,BECKETT>and I found this article from six years ago.

752
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,770
<21-16,BECKETT>等一下
<21-16,BECKETT>Wait a minute.

753
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:55,650
<21-17,CASTLE>韦斯利·康纳斯就是那个穿棕色皮夹克的男子
<21-17,CASTLE>Wesley Connors is the man in the brown leather jacket.

754
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:57,200
<21-18,BECKETT>我就知道他看着眼熟
<21-18,BECKETT>I knew he looked familiar.

755
00:29:58,250 --> 00:29:59,940
<21-19,ESPOSITO>这篇文章上说他被处死了
<21-19,ESPOSITO>This article says he's been executed.

756
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:02,110
<21-20,ALEXIS>各位  海莉认出代码的时候
<21-20,ALEXIS>Guys, when Hayley recognized the code,

757
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:03,610
<21-20,ALEXIS>表情就像见鬼了一样
<21-20,ALEXIS>she looked like she'd just seen a ghost.

758
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:04,970
<21-21,CASTLE>因为她确实见到鬼了
<21-21,CASTLE>That's because she did.

759
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:07,020
<21-21,CASTLE>韦斯利·康纳斯还活着
<21-21,CASTLE>Wesley Connors is still alive.

760
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:16,710
<21-21,CASTLE>有人吗
<21-21,CASTLE>Hello?

761
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:19,310
<21-21,CASTLE>韦斯
<21-21,CASTLE>Wes.

762
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:22,890
<22-1,HAYLEY>出来吧  是我
<22-1,HAYLEY>Come on out. It's me.

763
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:33,510
<22-2,WESLEY>成功了  海莉
<22-2,WESLEY>It worked, Hails.

764
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:36,370
<22-2,WESLEY>我们的计划终于实现了
<22-2,WESLEY>Our plan worked.

765
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:42,730
<23-1,MALLORY>这不可能
<23-1,MALLORY>This is impossible.

766
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:45,320
<23-1,MALLORY>韦斯利·康纳斯在伊朗被捉
<23-1,MALLORY>Wesley Connors was caught and tried for espionage

767
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,460
<23-1,MALLORY>并被判间谍罪
<23-1,MALLORY>by the Iranians.

768
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:48,750
<23-1,MALLORY>我们的情报部门确认他被处死了
<23-1,MALLORY>Our intelligence sources confirmed he was executed.

769
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:50,050
<23-2,CASTLE>显然  他们被骗了
<23-2,CASTLE>Well, obviously, they were duped.

770
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:50,800
<23-2,CASTLE>马洛里探员
<23-2,CASTLE>Agent Mallory,

771
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,490
<23-3,BECKETT>这个人攻击了伦敦电网
<23-3,BECKETT>this man perpetrated an attack on the London power grid

772
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:55,140
<23-3,BECKETT>还谋杀了两个人
<23-3,BECKETT>and murdered two people,

773
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:57,950
<23-3,BECKETT>你现在该配合我们了  告诉我们你知道什么
<23-3,BECKETT>so it's time to play ball and tell us what you know.

774
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:05,370
<23-4,MALLORY>我接下来要说的内容是绝密
<23-4,MALLORY>What I'm about to tell you is highly classified

775
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:06,960
<23-4,MALLORY>不可以外传
<23-4,MALLORY>and mustn't be repeated.

776
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:07,890
<23-4,MALLORY>明白了吗
<23-4,MALLORY>Are we clear?

777
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,680
<23-5,MALLORY>搞垮伦敦电网的病毒
<23-5,MALLORY>The worm that crashed the London power grid

778
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:13,960
<23-5,MALLORY>是海莉和韦斯利六年前
<23-5,MALLORY>was a variation on one

779
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:17,160
<23-5,MALLORY>设计的病毒的变种
<23-5,MALLORY>Hayley and Wesley designed six years ago.

780
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,700
<23-5,MALLORY>那是用来搞垮伊朗纳坦兹核反应堆的
<23-5,MALLORY>It was used to knock out uranium-enriching centrifuges

781
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:22,130
<23-5,MALLORY>铀浓缩离心机的
<23-5,MALLORY>at the Natanz reactor in Iran.

782
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,470
<23-5,MALLORY>你说的是震网病毒吗
<23-5,MALLORY>Are you talking about Stuxnet?

783
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:25,210
<23-6,CASTLE>那个让伊朗核项目
<23-6,CASTLE>That computer virus

784
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:27,690
<23-6,CASTLE>倒退了几十年的计算机病毒
<23-6,CASTLE>set the Iranian nuclear program back by decades.

785
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:30,340
<23-7,BECKETT>都说震网病毒是美国和以色列造的
<23-7,BECKETT>Stuxnet was supposedly created by the U.S. And Israel.

786
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:32,110
<23-8,MALLORY>假情报  警监
<23-8,MALLORY>Disinformation, Captain,

787
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:33,920
<23-8,MALLORY>是英国政府故意泄露的
<23-8,MALLORY>leaked by Her Majesty's government.

788
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,420
<23-8,MALLORY>和所有人一样  我们也想打击伊朗人
<23-8,MALLORY>We wanted to hit the Iranians as much as everyone else,

789
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:38,300
<23-8,MALLORY>所以我们派去了两个最好的特工
<23-8,MALLORY>so we put our best two agents on it.

790
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,390
<23-9,CASTLE>海莉和韦斯利
<23-9,CASTLE>Hayley and Wesley.

791
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:42,580
<23-10,MALLORY>由刚去世的布莱斯·罗伯茨领导
<23-10,MALLORY>Led by the recently deceased Bryce Roberts.

792
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:44,510
<23-10,MALLORY>这次行动成功了
<23-10,MALLORY>The op was a success.

793
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:48,510
<23-10,MALLORY>但他们的撤离点暴露了
<23-10,MALLORY>However, their extraction point was compromised.

794
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:51,510
<23-11,CASTLE>你说海莉扔下韦斯利等死
<23-11,CASTLE>You said Hayley left Wesley to die.

795
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:54,450
<23-12,MALLORY>是说过  我可能为了证明我的观点夸张了一点
<23-12,MALLORY>Yes, well, I might have exaggerated a bit to make a point.

796
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:58,020
<23-12,MALLORY>真相是  韦斯利没有准时到达集合地点
<23-12,MALLORY>Truth is, Wesley was late to the rendezvous,

797
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:00,440
<23-12,MALLORY>军情六处指挥部下令撤退的
<23-12,MALLORY>and MI6 command made the call.

798
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:02,730
<23-13,BECKETT>所以海莉才离开了军情六处
<23-13,BECKETT>That's why Hayley left MI6.

799
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:04,560
<23-13,BECKETT>她觉得他们背叛了韦斯利
<23-13,BECKETT>She felt that they betrayed Wesley

800
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,740
<23-13,BECKETT>导致了他的死亡
<23-13,BECKETT>and condemned him to die.

801
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:08,420
<23-14,MALLORY>所以我们现在陷入了困境
<23-14,MALLORY>Which brings us to our current dilemma.

802
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:10,920
<23-14,MALLORY>海莉和韦斯利交情甚密
<23-14,MALLORY>Hayley and Wesley were thick as thieves,

803
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:13,140
<23-14,MALLORY>他们对彼此的忠诚胜过情报局
<23-14,MALLORY>more loyal to each other than the service.

804
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,000
<23-15,CASTLE>你这是什么意思
<23-15,CASTLE>What are you saying?

805
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,120
<23-16,MALLORY>看样子他们是再次联手
<23-16,MALLORY>That it would appear - they have teamed up once again

806
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,520
<23-16,MALLORY>来报复我们
<23-16,MALLORY>to have their retribution.

807
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,430
<23-18,MALLORY>-你错了  -是吗  卡塞尔先生
<23-18,MALLORY>- You're wrong. - Am I, Mr. Castle?

808
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:22,830
<23-18,MALLORY>那么回答我  为什么海莉突然失踪了
<23-18,MALLORY>Then, tell me, why has Hayley suddenly disappeared?

809
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,690
<24-1,HAYLEY>我不明白
<24-1,HAYLEY>I don't understand.

810
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,590
<24-1,HAYLEY>他们给我看了证据说你死了
<24-1,HAYLEY>They showed me proof you were dead.

811
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,320
<24-1,HAYLEY>我没死
<24-1,HAYLEY>No.

812
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,050
<24-2,WESLEY>我倒是希望自己死了
<24-2,WESLEY>I just wished I was.

813
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:40,550
<24-3,HAYLEY>他们对你做了什么
<24-3,HAYLEY>What did they do to you?

814
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:41,320
<24-4,WESLEY>你了解我的
<24-4,WESLEY>You know me.

815
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:43,460
<24-4,WESLEY>我讨厌服从指挥  有时候我会拒绝
<24-4,WESLEY>I hate taking orders, so sometimes I refused.

816
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,670
<24-4,WESLEY>但他们从来不喜欢被拒绝
<24-4,WESLEY>But they never liked that.

817
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:48,370
<24-4,WESLEY>有时候我希望他们直接杀了我
<24-4,WESLEY>Sometimes I wished they'd just finish me off.

818
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:50,230
<24-4,WESLEY>有几次我试着自杀
<24-4,WESLEY>There was times I tried to myself.

819
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,020
<24-5,HAYLEY>韦斯  我很抱歉
<24-5,HAYLEY>Wes, I'm sorry.

820
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:52,850
<24-5,HAYLEY>不要抱歉
<24-5,HAYLEY>Don't be.

821
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:56,800
<24-6,WESLEY>你是支持我坚持下来的那个人
<24-6,WESLEY>See, you're the person that got me through it all.

822
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:58,480
<24-6,WESLEY>知道怎么回事吗
<24-6,WESLEY>You know how?

823
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:00,710
<24-6,WESLEY>我们的计划
<24-6,WESLEY>Our plan.

824
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:04,140
<24-6,WESLEY>它支撑着我度过了6年
<24-6,WESLEY>It kept me going for six years,

825
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,460
<24-6,WESLEY>给了我逃脱的意志
<24-6,WESLEY>gave me the will to escape.

826
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,530
<24-7,HAYLEY>你一直说我们的计划  我
<24-7,HAYLEY>You keep saying "Our plan." I --

827
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:11,180
<24-8,WESLEY>我们的退休计划  拜托  海莉
<24-8,WESLEY>Our bloody retirement plan. Come on, Hails.

828
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,550
<24-8,WESLEY>我们以前天天都在讨论
<24-8,WESLEY>We used to talk all the time

829
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:14,410
<24-8,WESLEY>如果我们能活到完成使命的那天
<24-8,WESLEY>about how if we survived the Queen's service,

830
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:17,380
<24-8,WESLEY>我们就用剩下的日子痛快地去环球旅行
<24-8,WESLEY>we'd spend the rest of our days traveling the world in style.

831
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:18,300
<24-8,WESLEY>你还记得吧
<24-8,WESLEY>You remember.

832
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:20,600
<24-9,HAYLEY>-每人一千万美元  -对
<24-9,HAYLEY>- $10 million each. - Yeah.

833
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:22,760
<24-10,WESLEY>你最近有查过你的银行账户吗
<24-10,WESLEY>Have you checked your bank account lately?

834
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:25,150
<24-10,WESLEY>现在你有了  我也有了
<24-10,WESLEY>Now you have it, and so do I.

835
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:27,230
<24-11,WESLEY>你通过了测试
<24-11,WESLEY>You passed the test.

836
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:29,890
<24-12,HAYLEY>这就是一个忠诚测试吗
<24-12,HAYLEY>This was all a loyalty test?

837
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,340
<24-13,WESLEY>这样才能知道你是否忠诚
<24-13,WESLEY>It was the only way to know.

838
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:32,900
<24-13,WESLEY>我必须得让你成为众矢之的
<24-13,WESLEY>I had to put a target on your back

839
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,950
<24-13,WESLEY>确保你不会向当局屈服
<24-13,WESLEY>and make sure you wouldn't capitulate to the authorities,

840
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:35,800
<24-13,WESLEY>你没有让我失望
<24-13,WESLEY>but you didn't.

841
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,700
<24-14,HAYLEY>韦斯利  你杀人了  你杀了布莱斯
<24-14,HAYLEY>Wesley, you murdered people. You killed Bryce.

842
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,400
<24-15,WESLEY>我当然杀人了
<24-15,WESLEY>You're damn right I did!

843
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:43,550
<24-15,WESLEY>他和我的祖国英国都抛弃了我
<24-15,WESLEY>He and Her Majesty's Kingdom abandoned me,

844
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:45,680
<24-15,WESLEY>他们应该得到惩罚
<24-15,WESLEY>so they had to be punished.

845
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,030
<24-16,HAYLEY>所以你把我们的病毒发出去
<24-16,HAYLEY>Which is why you sent our worm

846
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:49,090
<24-16,HAYLEY>让伦敦陷入黑暗
<24-16,HAYLEY>to plunge London into darkness.

847
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:53,070
<24-16,HAYLEY>韦斯  那些伊朗人把你逼疯了
<24-16,HAYLEY>Oh, Wes, your captors drove you mad.

848
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:56,700
<24-17,WESLEY>你怎么也这么说我呢
<24-17,WESLEY>How can you of all people say that to me?

849
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,390
<24-17,WESLEY>他们自找的
<24-17,WESLEY>They had it coming.

850
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:01,340
<24-17,WESLEY>他们全都是自找的
<24-17,WESLEY>They all did.

851
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:04,060
<24-17,WESLEY>你不明白吗
<24-17,WESLEY>Don't you see that?

852
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:06,620
<24-18,HAYLEY>韦斯利  抱歉
<24-18,HAYLEY>Wesley, I'm sorry.

853
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:09,170
<24-18,HAYLEY>真的非常抱歉
<24-18,HAYLEY>I'm so, so sorry.

854
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:11,300
<24-18,HAYLEY>我必须把你带回去
<24-18,HAYLEY>I have to take you in.

855
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:33,470
<25-1,MALLORY>集合地是预先决定好的
<25-1,MALLORY>The rendezvous was predetermined.

856
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:36,300
<25-1,MALLORY>因为海莉和韦斯利
<25-1,MALLORY>Predetermined because Hayley and Wesley

857
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,610
<25-1,MALLORY>相互勾结
<25-1,MALLORY>are in league with one another.

858
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:39,740
<25-2,CASTLE>他们现在没有合作
<25-2,CASTLE>They are not working together.

859
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:43,380
<25-2,CASTLE>但他们曾经合作过
<25-2,CASTLE>But they were at one point.

860
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:46,330
<25-2,CASTLE>他们是多年的搭档  合作过许多隐秘行动
<25-2,CASTLE>They were partners for years, working various black ops,

861
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:47,810
<25-2,CASTLE>也许在纽约也有过
<25-2,CASTLE>maybe even one here in New York.

862
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:50,260
<25-3,BECKETT>所以他们有以前的安全屋或者集结地
<25-3,BECKETT>Where they had an old safehouse or a staging area,

863
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:53,820
<25-3,BECKETT>一个他们都知道并信任的地方
<25-3,BECKETT>someplace that they both knew about and could trust.

864
00:34:56,770 --> 00:34:59,490
<25-4,MALLORY>好吧  我既不能确认  也不能否认
<25-4,MALLORY>Okay, look, I can neither confirm nor deny

865
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:02,070
<25-4,MALLORY>军情六处在美国领土上实施过任何行动
<25-4,MALLORY>MI6 has ever carried out any operations on U.S. Soil.

866
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:04,330
<25-5,CASTLE>行行行  告诉我们在哪
<25-5,CASTLE>Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just tell us where it is.

867
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:23,330
<26-1,WESLEY>我很惊讶  海莉
<26-1,WESLEY>I am shocked, Hayley.

868
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:25,820
<26-1,WESLEY>以前我们针锋相对的时候
<26-1,WESLEY>You always used to kick my ass

869
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:27,730
<26-1,WESLEY>你总是对我毫不手软
<26-1,WESLEY>whenever we sparred back in the day.

870
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,490
<26-2,HAYLEY>你想怎样  韦斯利
<26-2,HAYLEY>So, what's the plan, Wesley?

871
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:34,940
<26-2,HAYLEY>打算像他们折磨你一样折磨我吗
<26-2,HAYLEY>You gonna torture me like they did you?

872
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:36,340
<26-3,WESLEY>我永远不会对朋友那样
<26-3,WESLEY>I would never do that to a friend.

873
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:37,460
<26-3,WESLEY>我会给你个痛快
<26-3,WESLEY>I'll make it quick.

874
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,850
<26-3,WESLEY>刚才还是有开心的  不是吗
<26-3,WESLEY>It was fun for a moment, though, wasn't it?

875
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:43,080
<26-3,WESLEY>我们重新在一起的想法
<26-3,WESLEY>The thought of us together again.

876
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:47,140
<26-4,HAYLEY>你知道为什么我们能成为出色的间谍吗
<26-4,HAYLEY>Do you know why we were such effective spies?

877
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:50,890
<26-4,HAYLEY>因为  我们为任务的刺激而活着
<26-4,HAYLEY>Because we lived - for the rush of the mission.

878
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:53,220
<26-5,WESLEY>我们愿意为了这种愉悦感去死
<26-5,WESLEY>We were willing to die for that high.

879
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:55,740
<26-6,HAYLEY>然而我们错了
<26-6,HAYLEY>And we were wrong.

880
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:59,130
<26-6,HAYLEY>我们一生都不曾让别人了解过我们
<26-6,HAYLEY>After a lifetime of not letting anyone in,

881
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:00,390
<26-6,HAYLEY>甚至我们彼此也是这样
<26-6,HAYLEY>not even each other,

882
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,410
<26-6,HAYLEY>我找到了可以让我卸下心防的人
<26-6,HAYLEY>I found people who tore down my walls.

883
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:05,750
<26-6,HAYLEY>我找到了一个家庭  他们都是好人
<26-6,HAYLEY>I found a family, and they're wonderful.

884
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,650
<26-7,WESLEY>所以我才把你吊在这
<26-7,WESLEY>So that's why I gave you such a kicking.

885
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:11,800
<26-7,WESLEY>你对我心软了  海莉
<26-7,WESLEY>You've went and got soft on me, Hayley.

886
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,110
<26-8,HAYLEY>韦斯利  别这样  让我帮你
<26-8,HAYLEY>Wesley, don't do this. Let me help you.

887
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:14,930
<26-9,WESLEY>帮我
<26-9,WESLEY>Help me?

888
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,690
<26-9,WESLEY>亲爱的  你现在连自己都帮不了
<26-9,WESLEY>Love, you're not in a position to help yourself.

889
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,120
<26-10,HAYLEY>听着  我曾经是你的朋友
<26-10,HAYLEY>Listen, I was your friend once,

890
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,410
<26-10,HAYLEY>可以说是你一生中唯一的朋友
<26-10,HAYLEY>arguably the only one you've ever had in your entire life.

891
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:25,610
<26-10,HAYLEY>请让我再次成为你的朋友
<26-10,HAYLEY>Please let me be your friend once again.

892
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:33,490
<26-11,WESLEY>我唯一需要的朋友是我的一千万美元
<26-11,WESLEY>The only friend I need is my $10 million

893
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:34,830
<26-11,WESLEY>也许还包括你的
<26-11,WESLEY>and perhaps yours.

894
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:39,860
<26-12,HAYLEY>韦斯利  韦斯利
<26-12,HAYLEY>Wesley, Wesley...

00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:47,190
<26-13,HAYLEY>韦斯利  不  不
<26-13,HAYLEY>Wesley. No, no.

896
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:50,090
<26-13,HAYLEY>韦斯利·康纳斯
<26-13,HAYLEY>Wesley Connors!

897
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:52,490
<26-14,CASTLE>-纽约警察  -快把刀放下
<26-14,CASTLE>- NYPD! Police! - Drop the knife now!

898
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:53,350
<26-14,CASTLE>嘿
<26-14,CASTLE>Hey!

899
00:36:57,790 --> 00:36:58,890
<26-14,CASTLE>放松  放松
<26-14,CASTLE>Easy, easy.

900
00:36:58,950 --> 00:36:59,660
<26-15,CASTLE>-你没事吧  -嗯
<26-15,CASTLE>- You okay? - Yeah.

901
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:01,880
<26-16,HAYLEY>这里有只有我和韦斯利知道的秘密出口
<26-16,HAYLEY>There are secret exits only Wesley and I know about.

902
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,420
<26-16,HAYLEY>他会原路返回  就此消失
<26-16,HAYLEY>He's gonna double back and disappear.

903
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,230
<26-17,CASTLE>他们往那边去了
<26-17,CASTLE>They went that way.

904
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:07,190
<26-15,CASTLE>我们
<26-15,CASTLE>We...

905
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:09,360
<26-14,CASTLE>该死
<26-14,CASTLE>Damn it.

906
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,290
<26-12,HAYLEY>韦斯利
<26-12,HAYLEY>Wesley.

907
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:36,780
<26-18,HAYLEY>让我看到你的手
<26-18,HAYLEY>Let me see your hands.

908
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,360
<26-19,HAYLEY>把刀放下
<26-19,HAYLEY>Drop the knife.

909
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,430
<26-20,WESLEY>这是唯一的解决方法
<26-20,WESLEY>There's only one way this is going to end.

910
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:49,040
<26-22,WESLEY>-停下  -不是你死  就是我死
<26-22,WESLEY>- Stop. - Either you die or I die.

911
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,860
<26-23,HAYLEY>韦斯利  别逼我这么做
<26-23,HAYLEY>Wesley, don't make me do this.

912
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:51,780
<26-24,WESLEY>快点  海莉
<26-24,WESLEY>Come on, Hails.

913
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,100
<26-24,WESLEY>你已经杀过我一次了
<26-24,WESLEY>You killed me once already.

914
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,480
<26-25,HAYLEY>别  我恨自己离开你
<26-25,HAYLEY>Don't. I hated myself for leaving you.

915
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,950
<26-26,WESLEY>已经无法挽回了  亲爱的
<26-26,WESLEY>Water under the bridge, darling.

916
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:02,220
<26-27,WESLEY>接下来十秒无论发生什么  都不要后悔
<26-27,WESLEY>And whatever happens in the next 10 seconds, no regrets.

917
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:03,990
<26-27,WESLEY>对我来说  要么获得自由要么去死
<26-27,WESLEY>For me, it's freedom or death.

918
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,040
<26-28,HAYLEY>韦斯利  别这样
<26-28,HAYLEY>Wesley, please.

919
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:06,800
<26-29,WESLEY>再见  海莉
<26-29,WESLEY>Goodbye, Hayley.

920
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:07,770
<26-30,HAYLEY>韦斯利  不要
<26-30,HAYLEY>Wesley, no!

921
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:16,570
<26-30,HAYLEY>海莉
<26-30,HAYLEY>Hayley.

922
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:23,650
<26-31,CASTLE>你别无选择
<26-31,CASTLE>You had no choice.

923
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:25,910
<27-1,ESPOSITO>卡塞尔
<27-1,ESPOSITO>Castle!

924
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:27,720
<27-2,BECKETT>海莉
<27-2,BECKETT>Hayley?

925
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:48,360
<27-3,ESPOSITO>帮海莉在联调局把事情摆平真是干得漂亮
<27-3,ESPOSITO>Nice job smoothing things over with the Feds for Hayley.

926
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,420
<27-4,BECKETT>好吧  反正对他们来说
<27-4,BECKETT>Yeah, well, it didn't hurt

927
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:50,590
<27-4,BECKETT>能够了结一件恐怖案件
<27-4,BECKETT>that they were able to take credit

928
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:52,700
<27-4,BECKETT>而因此邀功  也不是什么坏事
<27-4,BECKETT>for closing down a terrorism case, so --

929
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,430
<27-5,RYAN>重获光明
<27-5,RYAN>Oh, let there be light.

930
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,160
<27-5,RYAN>也太快了
<27-5,RYAN>That was fast.

931
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,420
<27-6,BECKETT>因为海莉参与了那个病毒的创造
<27-6,BECKETT>Well, since Hayley co-created the worm,

932
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:02,310
<27-6,BECKETT>她知道怎么帮助英国政府打败它
<27-6,BECKETT>she knew exactly how to help the U.K. Authorities defeat it.

933
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,610
<27-7,RYAN>这结局也是皆大欢喜了
<27-7,RYAN>All's well that ends well.

934
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:04,980
<27-8,BECKETT>说到结局
<27-8,BECKETT>Speaking of endings, I can't think

935
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,430
<27-8,BECKETT>我想到个好办法来结束这一天
<27-8,BECKETT>of a better way to end this day

936
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:08,990
<27-8,BECKETT>我要跟我的得力警探一起喝几杯
<27-8,BECKETT>than by downing a few ice-cold ones with my lead detectives.

937
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:10,500
<27-10,BECKETT>-怎么样  -好
<27-10,BECKETT>- How about it?  - Okay.

938
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,970
<27-11,RYAN>-你请客对吧  -是的  当然
<27-11,RYAN>- You're buying, right? - Yeah, exactly.

939
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:14,090

<29-6,CASTLE>that your subconscious mind picked up on

965
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:50,140
<29-6,CASTLE>所以你才会梦见我背叛了你

970
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,660
<29-8,CASTLE>但我早该明白
<29-8,CASTLE>But I should have known better

971
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:01,030
<29-8,CASTLE>而不是想要给世界上最伟大的警探惊喜
<29-8,CASTLE>than to try and surprise the world's greatest detective,
