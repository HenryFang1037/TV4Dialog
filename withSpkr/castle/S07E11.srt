1
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:40,230
<1-1,MARTHA RODGERS>理查德  你都穿好衣服了
<1-1,MARTHA RODGERS>Richard, you're dressed.

2
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:41,760
<1-2,RICHARD CASTLE>这不都早上了吗
<1-2,RICHARD CASTLE>Well, it is morning, isn't it?

3
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:43,620
<1-3,MARTHA>只是你被禁止跟凯瑟琳
<1-3,MARTHA>Well, it's just that ever since you were banned

4
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,500
<1-3,MARTHA>一起办案之后
<1-3,MARTHA>from working cases with Katherine,

5
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,940
<1-3,MARTHA>你就经常一身睡衣在家
<1-3,MARTHA>you and your pajamas have seen an awful lot of each other.

6
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:50,130
<1-4,CASTLE>我觉得你太夸张了吧
<1-4,CASTLE>I think you're exaggerating.

7
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:53,400
<1-4,CASTLE>我的确偶尔放松身心  恢复精神
<1-4,CASTLE>I admit I've taken the occasional day off to recharge,

8
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,060
<1-4,CASTLE>但也不该说我就...
<1-4,CASTLE>but I hardly think it's fair.

9
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:56,870
<1-5,KATE BECKETT>卡塞尔  你都穿好衣服了啊
<1-5,KATE BECKETT>Wow. Castle, you're dressed?

10
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:58,210
<1-6,CASTLE>是的  我穿好了
<1-6,CASTLE>Yes, I'm dressed.

13
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:00,380
<1-6,CASTLE>没想到你们会这么小题大做
<1-6,CASTLE>I did not think it would be such an event.

14
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:01,720
<1-7,MARTHA>早上好  亲爱的
<1-7,MARTHA>Good morning, babe.

16
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:04,280
<1-8,BECKETT>你是为今天做了什么特别的安排吗
<1-8,BECKETT>Does this mean you have something special planned for today?

17
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,000
<1-9,CASTLE>事实上  我今天还真有特别的事
<1-9,CASTLE>As a matter of fact, I do have something special lined up...

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,030
<1-9,CASTLE>是一个给你准备的惊喜
<1-9,CASTLE>A surprise, actually, for you.

20
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,200
<1-10,BECKETT>真的  什么样的惊喜
<1-10,BECKETT>Really? What kind of a surprise?

22
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,610
<1-11,CASTLE>如果我说了  不就不是惊喜了
<1-11,CASTLE>Well, now, if I told you that, it wouldn't be a surprise.

23
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:15,530
<1-11,CASTLE>相信我  你会喜欢的
<1-11,CASTLE>But trust me, you're gonna love it.

24
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:16,950
<1-12,BECKETT>我为什么会觉得害怕呢
<1-12,BECKETT>Okay, now, why does that scare me?

25
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,240
<1-13,MARTHA>因为你聪明啊
<1-13,MARTHA>Because you're smart.

26
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,140
<1-14,BECKETT>得了  卡塞尔  说吧
<1-14,BECKETT>Hmm. Come on, Castle... spill.

27
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:21,780
<1-15,CASTLE>你这样的审讯大师
<1-15,CASTLE>A master interrogator like yourself,

28
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,360
<1-15,CASTLE>就这点本事吗
<1-15,CASTLE>and that's the best you've got?

29
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,180
<1-16,BECKETT>或许我这才刚开始呢
<1-16,BECKETT>Maybe I'm just getting started.

30
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,120
<1-17,CASTLE>看来不行了
<1-17,CASTLE>Or not.

32
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,530
<2-1,KEVIN RYAN>被害人是莎娜·贝克
<2-1,KEVIN RYAN>Victim is Shana Baker.

33
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:31,850
<2-1,KEVIN RYAN>从工资单来看
<2-1,KEVIN RYAN>According to her pay stubs,

34
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:34,120
<2-1,KEVIN RYAN>她是伊斯特本幼儿园的老师
<2-1,KEVIN RYAN>she worked at Eastbourne Preschool.

35
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:36,760
<2-1,KEVIN RYAN>凶手是从她卧室的窗户进来的
<2-1,KEVIN RYAN>Point of entry - is the window in her bedroom.

36
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:38,020
<2-1,KEVIN RYAN>有人敲碎了窗户
<2-1,KEVIN RYAN>Somebody broke the glass.

37
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:39,380
<2-2,BECKETT>那她肯定应该能听到
<2-2,BECKETT>She would have heard that.

38
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:40,740
<2-2,BECKETT>从她尸体的姿态来看
<2-2,BECKETT>And based on her body position,

39
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,490
<2-2,BECKETT>她似乎没有想逃的意思
<2-2,BECKETT>it doesn't look like she was trying to run away.

40
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:43,950
<2-3,SIDNEY PERLMUTTER>的确
<2-3,SIDNEY PERLMUTTER>No, she wasn't.

41
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,320
<2-3,SIDNEY PERLMUTTER>毫无防卫伤或挣扎的迹象
<2-3,SIDNEY PERLMUTTER>No signs of defensive wounds or a struggle.

42
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,870
<2-3,SIDNEY PERLMUTTER>一枪中胸
<2-3,SIDNEY PERLMUTTER>Just a single gunshot to the chest.

43
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:51,860
<2-4,BECKETT>所以她回到家时  凶手已经在等她了
<2-4,BECKETT>Which means our killer was in here when she came home.

44
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:55,910
<2-5,PERLMUTTER>如此聪明的女人怎么会自愿嫁给卡塞尔呢
<2-5,PERLMUTTER>How a woman so astute could choose to marry Castle.

45
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:57,240
<2-6,RYAN>得了  帕穆特  承认吧
<2-6,RYAN>Ah, come on, Perlmutter, admit it.

46
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,430
<2-6,RYAN>-你也想他了吧  -得了
<2-6,RYAN>- You miss him, too. - Please.

47
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,810
<2-7,PERLMUTTER>一想到他不会再出现在这儿
<2-7,PERLMUTTER>Just knowing he's not gonna be here

48
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:02,210
<2-7,PERLMUTTER>就觉得上班简直太美好了
<2-7,PERLMUTTER>makes coming to work sheer bliss...

49
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:04,260
<2-8,PERLMUTTER>惨剧除外
<2-8,PERLMUTTER>...All things considered.

50
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,280
<2-9,BECKETT>死亡时间
<2-9,BECKETT>Time of death?

51
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,420
<2-10,PERLMUTTER>从尸斑和肝脏温度来看
<2-10,PERLMUTTER>Well, lividity and liver temp suggest

52
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,000
<2-10,PERLMUTTER>是昨晚9点到10点30之间
<2-10,PERLMUTTER>between 9:00 and 10:30 last night.

53
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,530
<2-11,RYAN>邻居不在  应该是因此才
<2-11,RYAN>The neighbors were out, which is probably why

54
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:15,310
<2-11,RYAN>没人听到枪声  但鉴证组找到了这个
<2-11,RYAN>no one heard the shot, but CSU did find this.

55
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,310
<2-12,BECKETT>香烟头
<2-12,BECKETT>A cigarette butt.

56
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,100
<2-12,BECKETT>嗯
<2-12,BECKETT>Yeah.

57
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,250
<2-13,RYAN>在卧室窗户外的消防梯上
<2-13,RYAN>It was in the fire escape outside the bedroom window.

58
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,420
<2-13,RYAN>楼上楼下的邻居都不抽烟
<2-13,RYAN>The neighbors above and below are not smokers.

59
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,720
<2-14,PERLMUTTER>被害人也不是
<2-14,PERLMUTTER>Neither was the victim,

60
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,590
<2-14,PERLMUTTER>牙齿这么白不可能吸烟
<2-14,PERLMUTTER>not with pearly whites like these.

61
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,060
<2-15,BECKETT>如果凶手还有时间抽烟
<2-15,BECKETT>So if our killer had time to grab a smoke,

62
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,960
<2-15,BECKETT>那就不是擅闯民宅
<2-15,BECKETT>Then this wasn't a b&e.

63
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,730
<2-15,BECKETT>凶手是在等待她回来
<2-15,BECKETT>Our killer was lying in wait, which means...

64
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:34,010
<2-15,BECKETT>那么这就是预谋杀人了
<2-15,BECKETT>this was premeditated.

65
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:40,090
<2-16,BECKETT>狗哪去了
<2-16,BECKETT>Where's the dog?

66
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,050
<2-17,JAVIER ESPOSITO>不见了
<2-17,JAVIER ESPOSITO>Dog's gone.

67
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,650
<2-17,JAVIER ESPOSITO>可能是被枪声吓跑了
<2-17,JAVIER ESPOSITO>Might have been scared off by the gunshot.

68
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:47,250
<2-18,RYAN>或者  闪闪像灵犬莱西一样
<2-18,RYAN>Or, like Lassie, Sparkles is out there,

69
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,740
<2-18,RYAN>正在外找凶手呢
<2-18,RYAN>trying to track down our killer.

70
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,350
<2-19,ESPOSITO>不是吧  莱西
<2-19,ESPOSITO>Really? Lassie?

71
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,950
<2-20,RYAN>卡塞尔走了  总得有人来
<2-20,RYAN>Someone has to provide us with out-of-the-box thinking

72
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:52,990
<2-20,RYAN>提出比较新奇的看法
<2-20,RYAN>now that Castle's not around.

73
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:56,400
<2-21,CASTLE>谢了  不过我还是自己来吧
<2-21,CASTLE>Thank you. But I'll take it from here.

74
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,260
<2-21,CASTLE>卡塞尔  你怎么来了
<2-21,CASTLE>Castle? What are you doing?

75
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,190
<2-22,BECKETT>你知道你不能来的
<2-22,BECKETT>You know that you're not allowed to be here.

76
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,230
<2-23,CASTLE>其实  我可以
<2-23,CASTLE>Actually, I am,

77
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,870
<2-23,CASTLE>因为我已经不是理查德·卡塞尔
<2-23,CASTLE>because I'm no longer Richard Castle,

78
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,300
<2-23,CASTLE>普通市民了
<2-23,CASTLE>ordinary citizen.

79
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,510
<2-23,CASTLE>我现在  是理查德·卡塞尔
<2-23,CASTLE>I am now Richard Castle...

80
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,270
<2-23,CASTLE>私家侦探
<2-23,CASTLE>private investigator.

81
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:15,090
<2-24,BECKETT>你拿到了私家侦探的执照  还不告诉我
<2-24,BECKETT>You got your P.I.'s license... without telling me?

82
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:17,350
<2-25,CASTLE>我学了个网上课程  昨晚学完了
<2-25,CASTLE>I took an online course. Finished last night.

83
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:18,490
<2-25,CASTLE>惊喜吧
<2-25,CASTLE>Are you surprised?

84
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,100
<2-26,BECKETT>能谈谈吗
<2-26,BECKETT>Can we talk for a second?

85
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:21,410
<2-27,CASTLE>失陪
<2-27,CASTLE>Excuse me.

86
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:28,630
<2-28,BECKETT>卡塞尔  私家侦探执照也不能改变什么
<2-28,BECKETT>Castle, the P.I.'s license doesn't change anything.

87
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,640
<2-28,BECKETT>地检官还是不会允许你跟随我们调查的
<2-28,BECKETT>The D.A.'s still not gonna let you investigate with us.

88
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,500
<2-29,CASTLE>这就是妙处啊
<2-29,CASTLE>Oh, you see, that's the brilliant part.

89
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,360
<2-29,CASTLE>我不会跟你们一起调查
<2-29,CASTLE>I'm not going to be investigating with you.

90
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,370
<2-29,CASTLE>不  我要与你们同时
<2-29,CASTLE>No. Instead, I'm gonna conduct

91
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:41,510
<2-29,CASTLE>展开独立的调查
<2-29,CASTLE>my own parallel investigation alongside yours.

92
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,700
<2-30,ESPOSITO>想得美  但这是行不通的
<2-30,ESPOSITO>Nice try, but you know that's not gonna fly.

93
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,810
<2-31,CASTLE>其实  行得通
<2-31,CASTLE>Actually, it will fly.

94
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:46,320
<2-31,CASTLE>作为...
<2-31,CASTLE>You see, as a,

95

<2-31,CASTLE>有执照的私家侦探  我有权
<2-31,CASTLE>licensed P.I., I'm legally entitled

96

97
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:53,530
<2-32,RYAN>你的客户是谁
<2-32,RYAN>Ah. So who is your client?

<2-34,ESPOSITO>I'm sorry. So is this investigation.

100
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,090
<2-34,ESPOSITO>他说得对
<2-34,ESPOSITO>I'm afraid he's right.

101
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:01,990
<2-35,BECKETT>不管你有什么执照  犯罪现场不对外开放
<2-35,BECKETT>P.I.'s license or not, this crime scene is closed,

<2-35,BECKETT>你得走了
<2-35,BECKETT>so you're gonna have to go.

103
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,110
<2-36,CASTLE>没事
<2-36,CASTLE>That's fine.

104
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:14,420
<2-36,CASTLE>反正我需要看的东西我都看到了
<2-36,CASTLE>I've already seen everything I need to here anyway.

105
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:17,540
<2-36,CASTLE>我会去别处开始调查了
<2-36,CASTLE>I'll conduct my investigation elsewhere.

106
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,740
<2-37,BECKETT>去哪啊
<2-37,BECKETT>Elsewhere where?

107
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:22,540
<2-38,CASTLE>抱歉  机密信息
<2-38,CASTLE>I'm sorry, that's confidential, too.

108
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,750
<2-40,ESPOSITO>他不是认真的吧
<2-40,ESPOSITO>Is he serious?

109
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:31,070
<2-41,BECKETT>我觉得他是  而且我好头疼
<2-41,BECKETT>I think he is, and I think I'm getting a headache.

110
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,480
<2-41,BECKETT>莱恩  你能去找找
<2-41,BECKETT>Um, Ryan, see if you can get ahold

111
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,090
<2-41,BECKETT>大楼的管理员吗
<2-41,BECKETT>of this building's superintendent.

112
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:36,350
<2-41,BECKETT>找找附近的监控摄像头
<2-41,BECKETT>Look for any security cams

113
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:37,990
<2-41,BECKETT>并努力联系她家人
<2-41,BECKETT>and try to reach out to her next of kin.

114
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:40,210
<2-41,BECKETT>埃斯波  我们去她工作的学校查查
<2-41,BECKETT>Espo, you and I should go to the school that she worked for,

115
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:42,730
<2-41,BECKETT>看他们能不能透露一些莎娜生活上的事
<2-41,BECKETT>see if they can tell us anything else about Shana's life.

116
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,000
<3-1,ESPOSITO>私家侦探这档子事你真不知道
<3-1,ESPOSITO>You really didn't know about this P.I. thing?

117
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,650
<3-2,BECKETT>不是  我看到他在电脑前一泡几小时了
<3-2,BECKETT>No. I mean, I saw him spending hours on the computer,

118
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:51,270
<3-2,BECKETT>但我以为他是在打游戏呢
<3-2,BECKETT>but I just figured he was playing "Terra Quest."

119
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:56,780
<3-4,ESPOSITO>你准备怎么做
<3-4,ESPOSITO>So, what are you gonna do?

120
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,760
<3-5,BECKETT>我也没什么办法啊
<3-5,BECKETT>Well, there's not much that I can do.

121
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,000
<3-5,BECKETT>我知道他这么做是为了跟我在一起
<3-5,BECKETT>Look, I know that he's doioing this to spend time with me,

122
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,820
<3-5,BECKETT>我不想伤他的感情啊
<3-5,BECKETT>And I don't want to hurt his feelings.

123
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,250
<3-5,BECKETT>或许不会有什么问题吧
<3-5,BECKETT>I don't know, maybe it'll be...Harmless.

124
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,160
<3-6,ESPOSITO>没问题
<3-6,ESPOSITO>Harmless?

125
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,400
<3-6,ESPOSITO>他可是卡塞尔啊
<3-6,ESPOSITO>This is Castle we're talking about.

126
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,150
<3-7,BECKETT>可他对案件和被害人一无所知
<3-7,BECKETT>Okay, but he knows nothing about the case or the victim,

127
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,880
<3-7,BECKETT>他能惹多少麻烦呢
<3-7,BECKETT>so how much trouble can he be?

128
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,110
<3-8,ESPOSITO>我们就要知道了
<3-8,ESPOSITO>We're about to find out.

129
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,900
<3-9,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你怎么过来的
<3-9,BECKETT>Castle, how did you get here?

130
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,920
<3-10,CASTLE>事实证明地铁早上的确比车快
<3-10,CASTLE>Well, it turns out the subway really is faster in morning traffic.

131
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,390
<3-11,BECKETT>不  我是问你怎么会来这里
<3-11,BECKETT>No, I mean how did you get here,

132
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:21,050
<3-11,BECKETT>来莎娜工作的学校
<3-11,BECKETT>to the school where Shana worked?

133
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:22,660
<3-12,CASTLE>邻居知道的信息不多
<3-12,CASTLE>Oh, well, the neighbors didn't know very much.

134
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,570
<3-12,CASTLE>所以我猜你下一步大概会来单位
<3-12,CASTLE>I figured her work would be your next stop.

135
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,860
<3-12,CASTLE>我听说过这里啊
<3-12,CASTLE>So, I've heard about this place.

136
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,880
<3-12,CASTLE>市里的直属学校
<3-12,CASTLE>It's the feeder school in the city,

137
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:32,310
<3-12,CASTLE>三岁的权贵之家后代  都在这里上学
<3-12,CASTLE>the only place to be if you're 3 years old and connected.

138
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:34,250
<3-12,CASTLE>那不是斯伯丁·埃利奥特吗
<3-12,CASTLE>Isn't that Spalding Elliot over there?

139
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,230
<3-13,BECKETT>全州最厉害的检察官
<3-13,BECKETT>The state's top prosecutor.

140
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,150
<3-13,BECKETT>他是司法部长的候选人呢
<3-13,BECKETT>He's on the short list for attorney general.

141
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:42,130
<3-14,CASTLE>后面那位  詹姆斯·卡尔曼  网络富豪
<3-14,CASTLE>And behind him, James Kallman, internet billionaire.

142
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,280
<3-14,CASTLE>我还在共乘车道看到了吹牛老爹
<3-14,CASTLE>Even spotted Diddy in the carpool lane.

143
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:48,280
<3-14,CASTLE>这地方聚集了这座城市的精英
<3-14,CASTLE>Ah, this place is a bastion of the city's elite.

144
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,480
<3-14,CASTLE>不知道被害人在这儿做了什么
<3-14,CASTLE>I wonder what our victim did here,

145
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,170
<3-14,CASTLE>她究竟被卷入了怎样的邪恶计划里
<3-14,CASTLE>what foul scheme she was tangled in.

146
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:55,630
<3-15,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你不能就这样跟我进去
<3-15,BECKETT>Uh, Castle, you can't just follow me inside

147
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:56,940
<3-15,BECKETT>然后偷听的我调查
<3-15,BECKETT>and sit in on my interview.

148
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,330
<3-16,CASTLE>可实际上...
<3-16,CASTLE>Well, actually, um...

149
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:00,770
<3-16,CASTLE>是我先到的这里
<3-16,CASTLE>I was here first,

150
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:03,630
<3-16,CASTLE>所以你得跟着我进去
<3-16,CASTLE>So, really, you're following me.

151
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,450
<4-1,ANGELA MATTHEWS>莎娜是招生办主任
<4-1,ANGELA MATTHEWS>Shana was our admissions director.

152
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:10,070
<4-1,ANGELA MATTHEWS>家长  孩子  大家都很喜欢她
<4-1,ANGELA MATTHEWS>Parents, kids, everybody loved her.

153
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,560
<4-2,CASTLE>你觉得她最近表现正常吗
<4-2,CASTLE>How did she seem to you recently?

154
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,190
<4-2,CASTLE>行为上和以前有什么不同吗
<4-2,CASTLE>Any changes in her behavior?

155
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,640
<4-2,CASTLE>其实  这点我并不清楚
<4-2,CASTLE>Actually, I don't know.

156
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:16,600
<4-2,CASTLE>过去几天她并没有来上班
<4-2,CASTLE>She hadn't been around the past few days.

157
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,180
<4-1,ANGELA MATTHEWS>-为什么没有  -她之前一直在加班
<4-1,ANGELA MATTHEWS>- Why not? - She had been working long hours

158
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,640
<4-1,ANGELA MATTHEWS>为了最终确定新生的录取情况
<4-1,ANGELA MATTHEWS>to finalize admissions for our new students.

159
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,400
<4-2,CASTLE>她上周才把录取通知书发出去
<4-2,CASTLE>She just sent the acceptance letters out last week,

160
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,780
<4-3,BECKETT>所以她最近几天就请假休息了
<4-3,BECKETT>so she took the past couple of days off to recover.

161
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,820
<4-4,CASTLE>既然录取通知书发出去了
<4-4,CASTLE>If acceptance letters went out,

162
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,790
<4-4,CASTLE>是不是说拒信也已经发了呢
<4-4,CASTLE>does that mean rejection letters went out, as well?

163
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,360
<4-4,CASTLE>我知道你是怎么想的
<4-4,CASTLE>Look, I know what you're thinking,

164
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,410
<4-4,CASTLE>确实  家长们会变得情绪激动
<4-4,CASTLE>and, yes, parents can get a bit emotional,

165
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:36,790
<4-5,ESPOSITO>特别是在他们的孩子被拒绝录取之后
<4-5,ESPOSITO>especially when it comes to their kids being turned down.

166
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:40,750
<4-5,ESPOSITO>不过事情从没有变得像现在这么严重
<4-5,ESPOSITO>Nothing has ever risen to the level of something like this.

167
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:43,160
<4-5,ESPOSITO>也许今年确实变得严重了
<4-5,ESPOSITO>Well, maybe this year did.

168
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,680
<4-5,ESPOSITO>有个东西你们得听听
<4-5,ESPOSITO>There's something you guys got to hear.

169
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,620
<5-1,BRIAN WHITMAN>你觉得你可以就这样毁掉我孩子的人生
<5-1,BRIAN WHITMAN>You think you can ruin my kids' life?

170
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,470
<5-1,BRIAN WHITMAN>婊子  我知道你住哪里
<5-1,BRIAN WHITMAN>Bitch, I know where you live,

171
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,820
<5-1,BRIAN WHITMAN>你给我小心点
<5-1,BRIAN WHITMAN>and you'll never see me coming.

172
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:52,220
<5-2,ESPOSITO>这是几天之前留在莎娜的语音信箱里的
<5-2,ESPOSITO>This was left on Shana's voicemail a few days ago

173
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:54,020
<5-2,ESPOSITO>也差不多正好描述了她的遭遇
<5-2,ESPOSITO>and pretty much describes what happened to her.

174
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,780
<5-3,BECKETT>马修斯博士  你能认出这个声音吗
<5-3,BECKETT>Dr. Matthews, do you recognize this voice?

175
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:57,960
<5-3,BECKETT>我听不出来
<5-3,BECKETT>I'm afraid I don't.

176
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,200
<5-4,BECKETT>好的  问问其他员工
<5-4,BECKETT>Okay, check with the rest of the staff,

177
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,490
<5-4,BECKETT>看看是否有人认得
<5-4,BECKETT>see if anyone else does.

178
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:02,280
<5-5,ESPOSITO>我们还需要一份学校电话的通话记录
<5-5,ESPOSITO>We'll also need copies of the school's phone records,

179
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,140
<5-5,ESPOSITO>以及收到拒信的家长名单
<5-5,ESPOSITO>as well as a list of parents that received rejection letters.

180
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:05,940
<5-5,ESPOSITO>没问题
<5-5,ESPOSITO>Of course.

181
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,550
<5-6,CASTLE>能也给我一份那个名单吗
<5-6,CASTLE>Can I get a copy of that list, too?

182
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,650
<5-6,CASTLE>我就当那是拒绝了
<5-6,CASTLE>I'm gonna take that as a no.

183
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:13,050
<5-6,CASTLE>其实也不算意料之外
<5-6,CASTLE>Can't say that I'm shocked.

184
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:16,530
<5-6,CASTLE>一帮手握大权的人根本听不得一个不字
<5-6,CASTLE>A group of powerful people not used to hearing the word no.

185
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:17,950
<5-7,BECKETT>拜托  卡塞尔  你真的觉得
<5-7,BECKETT>Come on, Castle, you really think

186
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:21,160
<5-7,BECKETT>被一所幼儿园拒收就能成为谋杀的动机
<5-7,BECKETT>that rejection from preschool qualifies as motive for murder?

187
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,880
<5-8,CASTLE>像这家一样的直属学校
<5-8,CASTLE>With a feeder school like this one?

188
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,470
<5-8,CASTLE>被这所幼儿园拒收就意味着
<5-8,CASTLE>A rejection from here could mean

189
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:26,400
<5-8,CASTLE>没法进入好小学
<5-8,CASTLE>not getting into the "right" elementary school,

190
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,300
<5-8,CASTLE>从而影响高中
<5-8,CASTLE>which affects high school,

191
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,530
<5-8,CASTLE>进一步会影响大学  我的天
<5-8,CASTLE>which affects college, and, oh, my god.

192
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:32,720
<5-8,CASTLE>父母为了孩子总会有疯狂的举动
<5-8,CASTLE>Ah, people do insane things for their kids.

193
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:34,510
<5-8,CASTLE>你会明白的
<5-8,CASTLE>You'll see.

194
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:38,370
<5-9,CASTLE>你要去哪里
<5-9,CASTLE>Where are you off to?

195
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:39,670
<5-10,BECKETT>回局里
<5-10,BECKETT>Back to the precinct.

196
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:42,500
<5-12,BECKETT>卡塞尔  如果我能选的话...
<5-12,BECKETT>Look, Castle, if it was my choice --

197
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,250
<5-13,CASTLE>你误会了
<5-13,CASTLE>Oh, please.

198
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,240
<5-13,CASTLE>我才不会想去局里呢
<5-13,CASTLE>Why would I want to go to the precinct?

199
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,680
<5-13,CASTLE>不  私家侦探的工作是在现场完成的
<5-13,CASTLE>No, a P.I.'s work is done in the field,

200
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,080
<5-13,CASTLE>而且我已经找到许多有用的线索了
<5-13,CASTLE>and I've got lots of leads to follow up on.

201
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,230
<5-14,BECKETT>好的  那晚上见
<5-14,BECKETT>Okay. I'll see you tonight.

202
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:53,030
<5-15,CASTLE>晚上见
<5-15,CASTLE>See you tonight.

203
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:56,060
<5-16,CASTLE>真不公平
<5-16,CASTLE>So unfair.

205
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,320
<6-1,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>私家侦探
<6-1,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>A private investigator?

206
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,050
<6-2,BECKETT>我发誓  长官  和我一点关系都没有
<6-2,BECKETT>I swear, sir, I had nothing to do with this.

207
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:21,810
<6-3,GATES>可他还是出现在你的罪案现场了
<6-3,GATES>Yet he showed up at your crime scene!

208
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:25,590
<6-3,GATES>我要提醒你  地方检察官明确地说了
<6-3,GATES>Let me remind you, the D.A. was very explicit.

209
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,500
<6-3,GATES>他上次跟黑帮合作那桩案子之后
<6-3,GATES>Ever since he worked that case for the mob,

210
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:31,580
<6-3,GATES>卡塞尔先生就再也不能参与我们的调查了
<6-3,GATES>Mr. Castle can no longer take part in our investigations.

211
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,550
<6-3,GATES>他没有参与
<6-3,GATES>He's not.

212
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:34,120
<6-4,BECKETT>严格意义上来说  他是在进行
<6-4,BECKETT>I mean, technically, he's conducting

213
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,290
<6-4,BECKETT>他自己的调查  因为他有了执照
<6-4,BECKETT>his own investigation, and since he's licensed,

214
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:38,610
<6-4,BECKETT>法律上说  我也没法做什么阻止他调查
<6-4,BECKETT>legally, there's not much that I can do to stop him.

215
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:42,120
<6-5,GATES>好吧  探长  让我再重申一遍
<6-5,GATES>Okay, Detective, but let me be perfectly clear,

216
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,240
<6-5,GATES>你不能帮他调查
<6-5,GATES>you cannot help him either.

217
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:45,960
<6-5,GATES>你们俩也听着了
<6-5,GATES>And that goes for you, too.

218
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:48,000
<6-7,GATES>-你说什么  -不许分享情报
<6-7,GATES>- I'm sorry? - No sharing of information,

219
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,940
<6-7,GATES>不许给他权限  什么都不行
<6-7,GATES>no granting access, nothing,

220
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,660
<6-7,GATES>不然你们会后悔的
<6-7,GATES>or there will be hell to pay.

221
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,300
<6-7,GATES>听明白了吗
<6-7,GATES>Understood?

222
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,300
<6-8,RYAN>-是的  长官  -是的  长官
<6-8,RYAN>- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

223
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,330
<6-10,GATES>很好
<6-10,GATES>Good.

224
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,840
<6-11,ESPOSITO>"他能惹多少麻烦呢"
<6-11,ESPOSITO>"How much trouble can he be?"

225
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,190
<6-12,BECKETT>相信我  等他发现他得自己调查这案子
<6-12,BECKETT>Trust me, once he finds out that he has to work this case without me,

226
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:02,010
<6-12,BECKETT>他就会觉得无聊  然后就不管了
<6-12,BECKETT>he's gonna get bored, and he's gonna move on.

227
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:03,730
<6-13,ESPOSITO>他自己一个人找到了被害者的学校
<6-13,ESPOSITO>He found our victim's school without you.

228
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:04,540
<6-14,BECKETT>是啊  不过那个很简单
<6-14,BECKETT>Yeah, but that was easy.

229
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,230
<6-14,BECKETT>他又没法查到财务状况
<6-14,BECKETT>He doesn't have access to financials,

230
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:08,670
<6-14,BECKETT>或是通话记录  或是街头监控的录像
<6-14,BECKETT>to phone records, to street-cam footage.

231
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,230
<6-14,BECKETT>他能查到多少东西
<6-14,BECKETT>I mean, how far is he gonna get?

232
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,760
<6-15,RYAN>你知道什么情况最糟吗
<6-15,RYAN>You know what would really suck?

233
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,740
<6-15,RYAN>卡塞尔比我们先把案子破了
<6-15,RYAN>If Castle solved this case before we did.

234
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,210
<6-16,BECKETT>那是根本不可能的
<6-16,BECKETT>And this not possible.

235
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,130
<6-17,RYAN>是的  可是假如他成功了呢
<6-17,RYAN>Yeah, but what if he did?

236
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:20,620
<6-18,BECKETT>那我们的耳根就别想清净了
<6-18,BECKETT>Well, then we'd never hear the end of it.

237
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:23,660
<6-18,BECKETT>不  是你的耳根不会清净了
<6-18,BECKETT>Uh, no, you would never hear the end of it.

238
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,420
<6-19,ESPOSITO>你才是那个每天要和他回家的人
<6-19,ESPOSITO>You're the one who has to go home to that guy.

239
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:29,080
<6-20,BECKETT>他根本不可能在我们之前把案子破了的
<6-20,BECKETT>Listen, there is no way that he can solve this case before us.

241
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,120
<7-1,CASTLE>你是谁
<7-1,CASTLE>All right, who are you,

242
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:44,540
<7-1,CASTLE>你为什么会抱着死者的狗
<7-1,CASTLE>and what are you doing with a dead woman's dog?

243
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,460
<7-1,CASTLE>你以为你能偷袭我吗
<7-1,CASTLE>Think you can get the drop on me!

244
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:19,080
<7-1,CASTLE>你根本不知道你对付的是谁
<7-1,CASTLE>You don't know who you're messing with.

254
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:30,390
<7-1,CASTLE>你是谁  为什么要跟踪我
<7-1,CASTLE>Who are you? Why are you following me?

255
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,270
<9-1,JEREMY>没法回答...说不了话
<9-1,JEREMY>Can't answer...If can't talk.

256
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:38,740
<9-2,CASTLE>我叫理查德·卡塞尔  我是...
<9-2,CASTLE>Okay, my name is Richard Castle, and I'm --

257
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,680
<9-3,CASTLE>-我可以给你看...  -别  别
<9-3,CASTLE>- Oh, I can show you. - No, no!

258
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:43,230
<9-4,JEREMY>胡椒喷雾剂
<9-4,JEREMY>Pepper spray?!

259
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:45,220
<9-5,CASTLE>你为什么要这么做
<9-5,CASTLE>why did you do that?!

260
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:46,620
<9-6,JEREMY>我以为你要掏枪出来
<9-6,JEREMY>I thought you were reaching for a gun!

261
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,400
<9-7,CASTLE>不是的  我是拿我的私人侦探执照
<9-7,CASTLE>No, I was reaching for my P.I. license.

262
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,190
<9-8,JEREMY>你是个私家侦探
<9-8,JEREMY>You're a P.I.?

263
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,370
<9-9,JEREMY>兄弟  真抱歉  快起来
<9-9,JEREMY>Aw, man, I'm sorry. Come here.

264
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:57,000
<9-9,JEREMY>我上周被抢劫了
<9-9,JEREMY>I was mugged last week, all right?

265
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,180
<9-9,JEREMY>你不能这样跟踪别人
<9-9,JEREMY>You can't trail people like that.

266
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,140
<9-9,JEREMY>对不起
<9-9,JEREMY>Sorry.

267
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,250
<9-10,CASTLE>我正在调查莎娜·贝克的谋杀案
<9-10,CASTLE>I'm looking into the murder of Shana Baker.

268
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,190
<9-11,JEREMY>什么
<9-11,JEREMY>Oh, wait.

269
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,390
<9-12,CASTLE>-莎娜死了  -是的
<9-12,CASTLE>- Shana's dead? - Yes.

270
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,590
<9-13,JEREMY>她是我的朋友
<9-13,JEREMY>She was my friend.

271
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,030
<9-13,JEREMY>凶手是谁
<9-13,JEREMY>Hey, who killed her?

272
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,620
<10-1,ESPOSITO>布莱恩·惠特曼  藤泽资本的高级合伙人
<10-1,ESPOSITO>Brian Whitman, senior partner at Tenzer Capitol.

273
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:14,150
<10-1,ESPOSITO>那通威胁电话是来自他的办公室
<10-1,ESPOSITO>We traced the threatening call to his office.

274
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:14,870
<10-2,RYAN>这家伙是个大人物
<10-2,RYAN>The guy's a big shot

275
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,570
<10-2,RYAN>他的情绪问题比他的来头还要大
<10-2,RYAN>with even bigger anger-management problems,

276
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:20,320
<10-2,RYAN>上次直接把他的特斯拉撞向超他车的人
<10-2,RYAN>including slamming his Tesla into this driver who cut him off.

277
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,950
<10-3,BECKETT>学校里有人认出他了吗
<10-3,BECKETT>Anyone at the school recognize him?

278
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:25,050
<10-4,ESPOSITO>没有  但我让警员拿他照片去莎娜住处排查
<10-4,ESPOSITO>No, but I had unis show his picture around Shana's building.

279
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:26,730
<10-4,ESPOSITO>他留下那通电话留言的同一天
<10-4,ESPOSITO>The same day he left that voicemail,

280
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:28,210
<10-4,ESPOSITO>邻居看到他猛敲她的门
<10-4,ESPOSITO>neighbors saw him banging on her door,

281
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:29,400
<10-4,ESPOSITO>嘴里全是污言秽语
<10-4,ESPOSITO>Yelling obscenities.

282
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,650
<10-4,ESPOSITO>他说他会回来的
<10-4,ESPOSITO>He promised he'd be back.

283
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:32,770
<11-1,BRIAN WHITMAN>我是有点...激动了
<11-1,BRIAN WHITMAN>So I was a little...aggressive

284
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:35,250
<11-1,BRIAN WHITMAN>因为贝克女士没让我儿子进那学校
<11-1,BRIAN WHITMAN>when Ms. Baker didn't let my son into that school,

285
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,070
<11-1,BRIAN WHITMAN>可那并不能证明我杀了她
<11-1,BRIAN WHITMAN>but that doesn't mean I killed her.

286
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:38,660
<11-1,BRIAN WHITMAN>"婊子  我知道你住哪里
<11-1,BRIAN WHITMAN>"Bitch, I know where you live,

287
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,120
<11-2,BECKETT>你给我小心点"
<11-2,BECKETT>and you will never see me coming."

288
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,240
<11-2,BECKETT>我觉得这好像是句威胁吧
<11-2,BECKETT>That sounds like a death threat to me.

289
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,730
<11-3,WHITMAN>我当时比较激动
<11-3,WHITMAN>I was being dramatic.

290
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:45,570
<11-4,ESPOSITO>那你向她开枪的时候是什么样
<11-4,ESPOSITO>How were you being when you shot her?

291
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,310
<11-5,WHITMAN>你们不明白
<11-5,WHITMAN>Look, you don't understand.

292
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:48,360
<11-6,BECKETT>陪审团的人也不会明白
<11-6,BECKETT>And neither will a jury.

293
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,440
<11-7,WHITMAN>我没有理由要杀她
<11-7,WHITMAN>I had no reason to kill her.

294
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,790
<11-7,WHITMAN>关于我儿子的事  她改变主意了
<11-7,WHITMAN>She changed her mind about my son.

295
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,140
<11-7,WHITMAN>她决定让他入学
<11-7,WHITMAN>She decided to let him in.

296
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,420
<11-8,BECKETT>惠特曼先生  我们有学校给的记录
<11-8,BECKETT>Mr. Whitman, we have the school records.

297
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:59,420
<11-9,WHITMAN>这是两天前才发生的事
<11-9,WHITMAN>This just happened two days ago.

298
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,960
<11-9,WHITMAN>给他们打个电话  就能确认了
<11-9,WHITMAN>Call down there. You can check.

299
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:04,920
<11-9,WHITMAN>我还留着她给我写的信
<11-9,WHITMAN>I even have the letter she wrote me.

300
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:09,950
<11-10,ESPOSITO>你儿子已经被拒绝了
<11-10,ESPOSITO>Your son had already been rejected,

301
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:11,650
<11-10,ESPOSITO>为什么莎娜要改变主意
<11-10,ESPOSITO>So why would Shana change her mind?

302
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:12,620
<11-11,WHITMAN>我不知道
<11-11,WHITMAN>I don't know.

303
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:15,110
<11-11,WHITMAN>反正她就这么做了
<11-11,WHITMAN>She just did.

304
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,330
<12-1,BECKETT>惠特曼的不在场证据被确认了
<12-1,BECKETT>Whitman's alibi checks out.

305
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:18,290
<12-1,BECKETT>谋杀案发生的时候  他去了香港
<12-1,BECKETT>He was on an investment call to Hong Kong

306
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:19,650
<12-1,BECKETT>参加一个投资项目
<12-1,BECKETT>at the time of the murder.

307
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:22,190
<12-2,ESPOSITO>学校也确认了他说的话
<12-2,ESPOSITO>And the school verifies his claim.

308
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,670
<12-2,ESPOSITO>莎娜的确改变了主意
<12-2,ESPOSITO>Shana did reverse the decision on his son.

309
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,530
<12-3,BECKETT>你觉得她是因为惠特曼的威胁害怕了吗
<12-3,BECKETT>Do you think she gave into Whitman's threats?

310
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:30,200
<12-4,ESPOSITO>不会  校长说莎娜是绝对不会妥协的
<12-4,ESPOSITO>Nah. The headmistress said that Shana would never cut a deal.

311
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,020
<12-4,ESPOSITO>如果她觉得受到了威胁
<12-4,ESPOSITO>If she felt threatened,

312
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:33,520
<12-4,ESPOSITO>她会告诉学校或者警察的...
<12-4,ESPOSITO>she would have notified the school or the police...

313
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,230
<12-4,ESPOSITO>除非还有更多隐情
<12-4,ESPOSITO>unless there's more to this story.

314
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:37,690
<12-5,BECKETT>再查查惠特曼
<12-5,BECKETT>Let's dig into Whitman,

315
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,750
<12-5,BECKETT>看看还有没有别的事能把他和莎娜联系起来
<12-5,BECKETT>see if there's anything else that connects him to Shana.

316
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:40,960
<12-5,BECKETT>他肯定隐瞒了什么
<12-5,BECKETT>He's hiding something.

317
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,390
<12-6,RYAN>似乎被害人
<12-6,RYAN>Well, it looks like our victim

318
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:43,890
<12-6,RYAN>也隐瞒了一些事情
<12-6,RYAN>might have been hiding something herself.

319
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:45,700
<12-6,RYAN>据这张银行账单显示
<12-6,RYAN>According to this bank statement,

320
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,140
<12-6,RYAN>她在死前一天  从她的账户里
<12-6,RYAN>she withdrew $3,000 in cash out of her account

321
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,500
<12-6,RYAN>取出了三千块现金
<12-6,RYAN>the day before she died.

322
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,850
<12-7,BECKETT>我想这不是她正常的取款吧
<12-7,BECKETT>And I take it that's not her normal pattern of withdrawal.

323
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:52,560
<12-8,RYAN>的确不是
<12-8,RYAN>No, in fact,

324
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,320
<12-8,RYAN>这基本上把她的存款都取干净了
<12-8,RYAN>it nearly cleaned out her savings account.

325
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,880
<12-9,ESPOSITO>莎娜·贝克为什么
<12-9,ESPOSITO>So what would Shana Baker be doing

326
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,580
<12-9,ESPOSITO>需要这么一大笔现金呢
<12-9,ESPOSITO>that she needed that much cash?

327
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,590
<13-1,JEREMY>莎娜要去别的地方
<13-1,JEREMY>Shana was going out of town.

328
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:01,400
<13-1,JEREMY>所以她才把闪闪交给我照看
<13-1,JEREMY>That's why she wanted me to keep Sparkles.

329
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,090
<13-2,CASTLE>我猜你跟狗相处得
<13-2,CASTLE>I'm assuming you're better with dogs

330
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:04,510
<13-2,CASTLE>比跟人相处得好
<13-2,CASTLE>than you are with people.

331
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:06,420
<13-2,CASTLE>-她去了哪  -不知道
<13-2,CASTLE>- Where did she go? - No idea.

332
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,170
<13-3,JEREMY>其实  整件事都挺奇怪的
<13-3,JEREMY>In fact, the whole thing was sort of weird.

333
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:09,080
<13-4,CASTLE>为什么
<13-4,CASTLE>How so?

334
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:10,930
<13-5,JEREMY>通常当她需要我照看闪闪时
<13-5,JEREMY>Well, usually when I take Sparkles,

335
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:13,860
<13-5,JEREMY>她会提前几周告诉我  但这次是突然的
<13-5,JEREMY>she tells me weeks in advance, but this was really sudden.

336
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:15,270
<13-5,JEREMY>她让我立刻带走他
<13-5,JEREMY>I had to take him right away.

337
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:16,580
<13-5,JEREMY>而且她通常也会告诉我她要去哪
<13-5,JEREMY>And she always tells me where she's going,

338
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,220
<13-5,JEREMY>但这次没说
<13-5,JEREMY>but she didn't tell me this time.

339
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,330
<13-5,JEREMY>你觉得她这次外出跟她的死有关吗
<13-5,JEREMY>Do you think the trip had something to do with why she was killed?

340
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,570
<13-6,CASTLE>鉴于她把狗交给你的第二天
<13-6,CASTLE>Well, seeing as how she dropped her dog off with you

341
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,150
<13-6,CASTLE>就被谋杀了
<13-6,CASTLE>and the very next day she was murdered,

342
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:28,630
<13-6,CASTLE>所以我想是的  这两件事有关系
<13-6,CASTLE>my guess would be, yeah, the two are related.

343
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,810
<13-7,JEREMY>你觉得她去了哪
<13-7,JEREMY>Where do you think she went?

344
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,480
<14-2,CASTLE>-卡塞尔  -帕穆特
<14-2,CASTLE>- Castle! - Perlmutter.

345
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,540
<14-2,CASTLE>你在干...
<14-2,CASTLE>What are you...

346
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,200
<14-3,PERLMUTTER>你在看我的死者表单
<14-3,PERLMUTTER>you're looking at my victim's chart!

347
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,180
<14-4,CASTLE>我只是在确认一下你都填对了
<14-4,CASTLE>I'm just making sure you filled it out properly.

348
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,510
<14-4,CASTLE>我得说一句  你的字写得真好
<14-4,CASTLE>And may I say, for a man, you have exquisite handwriting.

349
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:47,640
<14-5,PERLMUTTER>快还给我
<14-5,PERLMUTTER>Oh, give it back!

350
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,970
<14-6,CASTLE>等一下  听我说
<14-6,CASTLE>Hey, hey, hey, look, look, look.

351
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:50,730
<14-6,CASTLE>你可以帮我很大一个忙  帕穆特
<14-6,CASTLE>You could make this a lot easier on me, Perlmutter.

352
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:52,570
<14-7,PERLMUTTER>就好像我活着就是为了帮你似的
<14-7,PERLMUTTER>Oh, because that's what I live for.

353
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:56,380
<14-8,CASTLE>我认为死者在死前
<14-8,CASTLE>I-I just believe that your victim traveled somewhere

354
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,540
<14-8,CASTLE>去过什么地方
<14-8,CASTLE>before she died.

355
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,890
<14-8,CASTLE>尸检中有没有什么发现表明她去过哪
<14-8,CASTLE>Is there anything in the autopsy that indicates where?

356
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:02,310
<14-9,PERLMUTTER>我宁愿死也不告诉你
<14-9,PERLMUTTER>I-I would rather switch places with her than tell you!

357
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:04,160
<14-9,PERLMUTTER>快还给我
<14-9,PERLMUTTER>Now... now, give me that!

358
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,030
<14-11,PERLMUTTER>-我警告你  卡塞尔  -找到了
<14-11,PERLMUTTER>- I am warning you, Castle! - Here it is.

359
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:07,400
<14-12,CASTLE>胃里的东西...
<14-12,CASTLE>Stomach contents...

360

<14-12,CASTLE>两盎司花生  部分被消化的咸饼干
<14-12,CASTLE>two ounces of peanuts, partially digested pretzels.

361
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:13,280
<14-12,CASTLE>血液里有非处方镇定剂成分
<14-12,CASTLE>Blood contains trace amounts of over-the-counter sedative.

362
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,660
<14-12,CASTLE>她是在飞机上  她飞去了什么地方
<14-12,CASTLE>She was on a plane. She flew somewhere.

363
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,380
<14-12,CASTLE>谢谢你的帮忙
<14-12,CASTLE>Thanks for your help.

364
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,360
<14-13,PERLMUTTER>这事没完
<14-13,PERLMUTTER>This isn't over!

365
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,400
<14-14,PERLMUTTER>-什么事  -我是贝克特
<14-14,PERLMUTTER>- What?! - It's beckett.

366
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,160
<14-15,BECKETT>我们在死者的财务记录里发现些异常
<14-15,BECKETT>We're trying to explain some anomalies

367
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,790
<14-15,BECKETT>想要知道原因
<14-15,BECKETT>in our victim's financial records.

368
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,900
<14-15,BECKETT>有没有证据表明她最近去过什么远地方
<14-15,BECKETT>Are there any signs that she traveled recently?

369
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,140
<14-16,PERLMUTTER>事实上
<14-16,PERLMUTTER>Well, as a matter of fact,

370
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:35,420
<14-16,PERLMUTTER>我刚跟你的作家丈夫讨论过这件事
<14-16,PERLMUTTER>I was just discussing that with the writer you married.

371
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,420
<15-1,ESPOSITO>卡塞尔去了停尸房
<15-1,ESPOSITO>Castle was at the morgue?

372
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:39,260
<15-1,ESPOSITO>他怎么知道死者离开过城
<15-1,ESPOSITO>How the hell did he find out our victim had left town?

373
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,640
<15-2,BECKETT>不知道  不过帕穆特说她坐过飞机是对的
<15-2,BECKETT>I don't know, but Perlmutter was right about the air travel.

374
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,110
<15-2,BECKETT>根据运输安全管理局的记录
<15-2,BECKETT>According to T.S.A. records,

375
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:46,310
<15-2,BECKETT>莎娜两天前乘坐4:30的航班去了波士顿
<15-2,BECKETT>Shana took a 4:30 flight to Boston two days ago.

376
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:47,560
<15-3,ESPOSITO>她去波士顿干什么
<15-3,ESPOSITO>What was she doing in Boston?

377
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:49,620
<15-4,BECKETT>她没有家人或者朋友在那里
<15-4,BECKETT>She doesn't have any family or friends there,

378
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:50,940
<15-4,BECKETT>而且我问过学校
<15-4,BECKETT>And I spoke to the school.

379
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:51,880
<15-4,BECKETT>她去那也不是出差
<15-4,BECKETT>She wasn't there for work,

380
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,450
<15-4,BECKETT>她是用现金付的款
<15-4,BECKETT>but she paid for the trip in cash

381
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:54,940
<15-4,BECKETT>似乎她不想让别人知道这件事
<15-4,BECKETT>like she was trying to keep it secret.

382
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:57,060
<15-5,ESPOSITO>上面说她从波士顿回来的航班
<15-5,ESPOSITO>It says here that her return flight from Boston

383
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,770
<15-5,ESPOSITO>于昨天下午6点落地
<15-5,ESPOSITO>landed yesterday at 6:00 P.M.

384
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:01,660
<15-6,BECKETT>也就是她死前数小时
<15-6,BECKETT>Just hours before her murder that night,

387
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:02,820
<15-6,BECKETT>说明这次行程
<15-6,BECKETT>meaning this mystery trip

388
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,140
<15-6,BECKETT>或许跟她的死有关
<15-6,BECKETT>might have something to do with her death.

389
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,770
<15-7,ESPOSITO>是  你再看看这个
<15-7,ESPOSITO>Yeah. And look at this.

390
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,340
<15-7,ESPOSITO>根据她的手机通话记录  她下飞机后
<15-7,ESPOSITO>According to her cell records, right after she landed,

391
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,560
<15-7,ESPOSITO>立刻给《纽约文汇》新闻办公室打了电话
<15-7,ESPOSITO>she made a call to the New York Ledger news desk.

392
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,470
<15-8,BECKETT>一个幼儿园的招生主任
<15-8,BECKETT>What's a preschool admissions officer doing

393
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,690
<15-8,BECKETT>为什么要给《纽约文汇》新闻办公室打电话
<15-8,BECKETT>calling the Ledger news desk?

394
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:15,430
<15-9,ESPOSITO>或许她发现了什么有新闻价值的事
<15-9,ESPOSITO>Maybe she uncovered something that she thought was a story.

395
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,900
<15-9,ESPOSITO>但我跟他们确认过
<15-9,ESPOSITO>But I checked with them over there,

396
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,030
<15-9,ESPOSITO>没人记得跟她通过话
<15-9,ESPOSITO>and nobody remembers talking to her.

397
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,920
<15-10,BECKETT>我们得搞清楚她在行程中做了什么
<15-10,BECKETT>We got to find out what she was doing during that trip.

398
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:21,040
<15-11,ESPOSITO>是的  没错
<15-11,ESPOSITO>Yeah, we do,

399
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,400
<15-11,ESPOSITO>要赶在你老公之前  以免我们难堪
<15-11,ESPOSITO>before your husband does and makes us all look bad.

400
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,370
<15-12,RYAN>我可以帮忙
<15-12,RYAN>I can help with that.

401
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:27,710
<15-12,RYAN>莎娜的信用卡所付的最后一笔钱
<15-12,RYAN>The last charge that Shana made on her credit card

402
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:30,410
<15-12,RYAN>是两天前在一家餐馆的账单
<15-12,RYAN>was for a lunch at a restaurant two days ago.

403
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:31,450
<15-13,BECKETT>是在她出城之前
<15-13,BECKETT>That's right before she left town.

404
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:34,530
<15-14,RYAN>她是跟这个叫妮可·莫里斯女人平分的账单
<15-14,RYAN>She split the bill with this woman, Nicole Morris.

405
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,480
<15-14,RYAN>她是哈里森-里德律所的一名律师
<15-14,RYAN>She's an attorney at Harrison and Reid.

406
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,390
<15-15,ESPOSITO>这可是全国数一数二的律所
<15-15,ESPOSITO>That's one of the top law firms in the country.

407
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:39,900
<15-15,ESPOSITO>莎娜为什么要去见律师
<15-15,ESPOSITO>Why would Shana be meeting with an attorney?

408
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:40,850
<15-15,ESPOSITO>不知道
<15-15,ESPOSITO>I don't know.

409
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:42,980
<15-16,RYAN>不过  一位名律师
<15-16,RYAN>But a high-powered attorney,

410
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:45,590
<15-16,RYAN>一段用现金支付的秘密行程
<15-16,RYAN>a secret trip paid for in cash,

411
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:48,370
<15-16,RYAN>再加一通打给新闻办公室的电话
<15-16,RYAN>and a phone call to a news desk.

412
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:52,540
<15-16,RYAN>这好像是个大阴谋
<15-16,RYAN>This is starting to smell like conspiracy.

413
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,680
<15-17,ESPOSITO>虽然我也不想承认
<15-17,ESPOSITO>Well, I hate to admit it,

414
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,820
<15-17,ESPOSITO>不过这位小卡塞尔可能是对的
<15-17,ESPOSITO>but baby Castle over here might be right.

415
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:58,260
<15-18,BECKETT>无论是不是阴谋  既然莎娜临走前见过
<15-18,BECKETT>Conspiracy or not, if this lawyer met with Shana

416
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,300
<15-18,BECKETT>这个律师  那么她可能会知道些什么
<15-18,BECKETT>just before her trip, she may know something about it.

417
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,830
<15-18,BECKETT>我去哪能找到她
<15-18,BECKETT>So where can I find her?

418
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:04,270
<15-19,RYAN>她的助手说她一整天都在外面见客户
<15-19,RYAN>Her assistant says that she's out all day with some clients,

419
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:06,250
<15-19,RYAN>不过你或许能在她3点约的人那里找到她
<15-19,RYAN>but you might be able to catch her at her 3:00.

420
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,920
<15-20,BECKETT>-这是地址  -好的  谢了

<16-3,CASTLE>欢迎来到理查德·卡塞尔侦探社
<16-3,CASTLE>Welcome to Richard Castle Investigations.

00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,540
<17-3,BECKETT>夫妻之间是没有秘密的
<17-3,BECKETT>Married people tell each other things.

432
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:10,060
<17-4,CASTLE>是的  可当你得知我拿到私家侦探执照时
<17-4,CASTLE>Yeah, but you weren't exactly thrilled

433
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,220
<17-4,CASTLE>你简直吓坏了
<17-4,CASTLE>when I got my P.I. license.

434
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,090
<17-4,CASTLE>因为之前你没告诉过我
<17-4,CASTLE>'Cause you didn't tell me.

435
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:14,720
<17-5,BECKETT>她在这里干什么
<17-5,BECKETT>Now, what is she doing here?

436
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,620
<17-6,CASTLE>死者出城前
<17-6,CASTLE>Oh. She had lunch with the victim

437
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,560
<17-6,CASTLE>跟她一起吃过午饭
<17-6,CASTLE>right before the victim left town.

438
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,760
<17-7,BECKETT>不不  我问你怎么找到她的
<17-7,BECKETT>No, no, no. I mean how did you find her?

439
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,080
<17-8,CASTLE>我查看了被害人的信用卡记录
<17-8,CASTLE>Ah, I was checking the victim's credit card

440
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,240
<17-8,CASTLE>想找她的机票费用信息以查出她要去哪里
<17-8,CASTLE>for plane-ticket charges to see where she flew,

441
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,300
<17-8,CASTLE>-结果却找到了餐费记录  -等等
<17-8,CASTLE>- and instead I found a lunch charge -- - Wait a minute.

442
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,380
<17-9,BECKETT>你查看了她的信用卡记录  怎么查的
<17-9,BECKETT>You checked her credit-card records? How?

443
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,130
<17-10,CASTLE>这个问题涉及到一个灰色区域
<17-10,CASTLE>Okay, we're getting into kind of a gray area here,

444
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:34,430
<17-10,CASTLE>只能说  这里提及到她的娘家姓
<17-10,CASTLE>so let's just say it involved her mother's maiden name

445
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,390
<17-10,CASTLE>和像模像样的假声
<17-10,CASTLE>and a serviceable falsetto.

446
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:39,990
<17-11,NICOLE>对不起  我还有别的约会
<17-11,NICOLE>Uh, I'm sorry. I-I have another appointment.

447
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:40,940
<17-11,NICOLE>还需要多久
<17-11,NICOLE>Is this gonna take much longer?

448
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,730
<17-12,CASTLE>马上就进去  莫里斯女士
<17-12,CASTLE>Be right there, Ms. Morris.

449
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:45,930
<17-13,CASTLE>探长  既然你已经来了
<17-13,CASTLE>So, detective, so long as you're here,

450
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,590
<17-13,CASTLE>是否愿意来旁听我的问话呢
<17-13,CASTLE>would you care to sit in on my interview?

451
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:53,850
<18-1,NICOLE>你打电话之前我根本不知道她被杀害了
<18-1,NICOLE>I-I had no idea she had been killed until you called.

452
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:56,270
<18-1,NICOLE>那真是  太让我震惊了
<18-1,NICOLE>It was...quite a shock.

453
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,790
<18-2,CASTLE>莫里斯女士  你对莎娜了解多少
<18-2,CASTLE>Ms. Morris, - how well did you know Shana?

454
00:17:58,790 --> 00:17:59,440
<18-3,NICOLE>不是很了解
<18-3,NICOLE>Not very.

455
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:00,860
<18-3,NICOLE>我是几个月前为我女儿
<18-3,NICOLE>I-I met her a few months back

456
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:03,600
<18-3,NICOLE>参观伊斯特本学校的时候认识她的
<18-3,NICOLE>when I toured Eastbourne's school for my daughter.

457
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,960
<18-3,NICOLE>我们很合得来  但是我今年不打算申请
<18-3,NICOLE>We hit it off, but I decided not to apply this year,

458
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,810
<18-3,NICOLE>所以当她那天打电话给我时  我很惊讶
<18-3,NICOLE>so I was surprised when she called the other day.

459
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:11,390
<18-3,NICOLE>她说事情紧急  出城之前
<18-3,NICOLE>She said it was urgent that she needed to meet

460
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:12,460
<18-3,NICOLE>必须跟我见一面
<18-3,NICOLE>before she left town.

461
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,400
<18-4,CASTLE>她说过要去哪里吗
<18-4,CASTLE>Did she say where she was going?

462
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,620
<18-5,NICOLE>好像是波士顿
<18-5,NICOLE>Boston, I-I think.

463
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,710
<18-5,NICOLE>关于拉德诺大学的一些事
<18-5,NICOLE>Something about Radnor University.

464
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:18,960
<18-6,BECKETT>她有提过为什么要去那里吗
<18-6,BECKETT>Did she mention why she was going there?

465
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,510
<18-7,NICOLE>没有  坦白说
<18-7,NICOLE>No, and frankly,

466
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:22,380
<18-7,NICOLE>她提出那些问题以后
<18-7,NICOLE>after the questions she was asking,

467
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:23,850
<18-7,NICOLE>我根本不想知道她去干什么
<18-7,NICOLE>I didn't really want to know.

468
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:25,300
<18-8,BECKETT>为什么  她问你什么了
<18-8,BECKETT>Why? What did she ask about?

469
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,320
<18-8,BECKETT>谋杀
<18-8,BECKETT>Murder --

470
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:29,270
<18-9,NICOLE>特别是  马萨诸塞州
<18-9,NICOLE>Specifically, felony statutes covering murder

471
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:31,300
<18-9,NICOLE>关于谋杀的刑事法规
<18-9,NICOLE>in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,

472
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,160
<18-9,NICOLE>什么算是协从谋杀
<18-9,NICOLE>what qualifies as accessory to murder,

473
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,380
<18-9,NICOLE>共谋谋杀
<18-9,NICOLE>conspiracy to commit murder,

474
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,190
<18-9,NICOLE>谋杀和过失杀人有什么区别
<18-9,NICOLE>what's the difference between murder and manslaughter,

475
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:36,980
<18-9,NICOLE>这方面的东西
<18-9,NICOLE>that sort of thing.

476
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:39,330
<18-9,NICOLE>我希望她是出于学术原因才感兴趣的
<18-9,NICOLE>I was hoping her interest was theoretical,

477
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:43,690
<18-9,NICOLE>但现在她死了  可能并不是那样
<18-9,NICOLE>but now that she's dead, maybe it wasn't.

478
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,390
<19-1,CASTLE>再一次感谢您  莫里斯女士  耽误您的时间
<19-1,CASTLE>Again, thank you, Ms. Morris, for your time.

479

<19-2,NICOLE>不客气

<19-2,NICOLE>如果需要帮忙随时给我打电话
<19-2,NICOLE>Please call me if I can help in any way.

482
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:54,990
<19-4,CASTLE>听见了吗  关于谋杀的刑事法规
<19-4,CASTLE>Did you hear that -- felony law about murder?

483
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:55,770
<19-4,CASTLE>你知道这表示什么吗
<19-4,CASTLE>Do you know what this means?

484
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:57,140
<19-5,BECKETT>是的  莎娜的这次远行
<19-5,BECKETT>Yes, that there's a hell of a lot more

485
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,370
<19-5,BECKETT>还有很多是我们不知道的
<19-5,BECKETT>to Shana's trip than we know.

486
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,850
<19-6,CASTLE>不管她在那里惹上了什么麻烦
<19-6,CASTLE>And whatever trouble she got involved in up there,

487
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:01,900
<19-6,CASTLE>我打赌那肯定跟着她回来了
<19-6,CASTLE>I'm betting it followed her home.

488
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,780
<19-7,BECKETT>好的  如果是那样的话  那么...
<19-7,BECKETT>Okay, - if that's the case, then...

489
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:05,820
<19-7,BECKETT>我...
<19-7,BECKETT>I'm --

490
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,740
<19-7,BECKETT>对不起  卡塞尔
<19-7,BECKETT>Uh, I'm sorry, Castle.

491
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,770
<19-7,BECKETT>我们不可以这样做
<19-7,BECKETT>Uh, we shouldn't be doing this.

492
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:09,380
<19-8,CASTLE>做什么
<19-8,CASTLE>Doing what?

493
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:12,600
<19-9,BECKETT>这种  你和我一起推理案件
<19-9,BECKETT>Uh, this -- - you, me theorizing together.

494
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,810
<19-9,BECKETT>这样不可以  尤其不能在这里
<19-9,BECKETT>It's just -- it's not right, especially here,

495
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:16,130
<19-9,BECKETT>因为私家侦探的事  我...
<19-9,BECKETT>after this whole P.I. thing. I --

496
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,660
<19-10,CASTLE>不  不要
<19-10,CASTLE>No. Shh! Don't --

497
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,840
<19-10,CASTLE>不要想这些
<19-10,CASTLE>Don't think about it.

498
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:22,450
<19-10,CASTLE>只要想想我们一起工作时的那种感觉
<19-10,CASTLE>Just think about how it feels when we work together.

499
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,900
<19-10,CASTLE>而且  这里只有我们俩
<19-10,CASTLE>Besides, we have the place to ourselves.

500
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,180
<19-10,CASTLE>谁会知道呢
<19-10,CASTLE>Who's gonna know?

501
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:26,910
<19-11,BECKET>-是啊  -是啊
<19-11,BECKET>- Yeah. - Yeah.

502
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,510
<19-14,CASTLE>-工作上的事  -不要接
<19-14,CASTLE>- It's work. - Don't answer it.

503
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:31,450
<19-15,BECKETT>不  我必须接
<19-15,BECKETT>No, but I have to.

504
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:34,280
<19-16,BECKETT>埃斯波  什么事
<19-16,BECKETT>Hi, Espo. What's up?

505
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,260
<19-17,ESPOSITO>之前你让我深入调查布莱恩·惠特曼
<19-17,ESPOSITO>So, you asked me to dig deeper on Brian Whitman,

506
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,010
<19-17,ESPOSITO>看能否发现与莎娜之间的联系
<19-17,ESPOSITO>see if there were any other connections to Shana.

507
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,480
<19-17,ESPOSITO>你绝对猜不到我发现了什么
<19-17,ESPOSITO>Well, you'll never guess what I found.

508
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:43,230
<19-17,ESPOSITO>不
<19-17,ESPOSITO>No.

509
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:45,610
<19-18,BECKETT>不  你说得对  那不可能是巧合
<19-18,BECKETT>No, you're right, - that can't be a coincidence.

510
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:46,850
<19-19,CASTLE>什么不可能是巧合
<19-19,CASTLE>What's not a coincidence?

511
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:48,200
<19-20,BECKETT>好的  把他带来
<19-20,BECKETT>Okay, bring him in.

512
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,360
<19-21,CASTLE>把谁带来
<19-21,CASTLE>Bring who in?

513
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,850
<19-22,BECKETT>对不起  宝贝  我得走了
<19-22,BECKETT>I'm sorry, baby, I got to go.

514
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,500
<19-23,CASTLE>你什么都不打算告诉我吗
<19-23,CASTLE>You're not gonna tell me anything?!

515
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:57,730
<19-23,CASTLE>你刚才还说夫妻之间没有秘密的
<19-23,CASTLE>You said married people tell each other things!

516
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,690
<20-1,WHITMAN>你以为自己是谁  警官
<20-1,WHITMAN>Who the hell do you think you are, detective?!

517
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:04,080
<20-1,WHITMAN>为什么又带我回来
<20-1,WHITMAN>Why am I back here?!

518
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,310
<20-2,BECKETT>惠特曼先生  请坐
<20-2,BECKETT>Uh, Mr. Whitman, please.

519
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,720
<20-3,BECKETT>你是个很慷慨的人
<20-3,BECKETT>You know, you're a generous man.

520
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,020
<20-3,BECKETT>你支持慈善事业
<20-3,BECKETT>You support charitable causes.

521
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:16,830
<20-3,BECKETT>你是众多受人尊敬的组织的董事会成员
<20-3,BECKETT>You sit on the board of numerous esteemed organizations,

522
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,650
<20-3,BECKETT>其中包括拉德诺大学
<20-3,BECKETT>including Radnor University.

523
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:19,400
<20-4,WHITMAN>那又怎样
<20-4,WHITMAN>So?

524
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:22,820
<20-5,ESPOSITO>在莎娜·贝克死之前  她去了拉德诺
<20-5,ESPOSITO>So just before Shana Baker died, she took a trip to Radnor.

525
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:24,030
<20-5,ESPOSITO>这件事你知道吗
<20-5,ESPOSITO>You know anything about that?

526
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,260
<20-6,WHITMAN>抱歉  我帮不上忙
<20-6,WHITMAN>Sorry. Can't help you.

527
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,160
<20-7,BECKETT>我认为你可以的
<20-7,BECKETT>I think you can.

528
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,420
<20-7,BECKETT>她的行程  你在学校董事会的地位
<20-7,BECKETT>Her trip, your position on the school's board,

529
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,760
<20-7,BECKETT>她帮你儿子进入那所幼儿园
<20-7,BECKETT>and her help in getting your son into that preschool --

530
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,370
<20-7,BECKETT>我认为这三件事之间有联系
<20-7,BECKETT>I think those three are related.

531
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:33,610
<20-8,ESPOSITO>你来告诉我们联系是什么
<20-8,ESPOSITO>And you're gonna tell us how,

532
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:36,170
<20-8,ESPOSITO>不然迟早我们也会查出来的
<20-8,ESPOSITO>or we're just gonna find out anyway.

533
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:37,890
<20-8,ESPOSITO>那时我们会以阻碍司法罪逮捕你
<20-8,ESPOSITO>Then we're gonna take your ass down for obstruction

534
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:39,940
<20-8,ESPOSITO>也可能是协从谋杀
<20-8,ESPOSITO>and maybe accessory to murder.

535
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,010
<20-9,BECKETT>更别提当那所幼儿园得知
<20-9,BECKETT>Not to mention what's gonna happen

536
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:42,140
<20-9,BECKETT>你拒绝协助调查
<20-9,BECKETT>at that preschool when they find out

537
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:44,520
<20-9,BECKETT>他们一名员工的谋杀案
<20-9,BECKETT>you refused to cooperate on an investigation

538
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,160
<20-9,BECKETT>结果会如何吧
<20-9,BECKETT>of one of their employees' deaths.

539
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,150
<20-9,BECKETT>我认为你的孩子
<20-9,BECKETT>I don't think your kid

540
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:49,380
<20-9,BECKETT>不会在那里待多久了
<20-9,BECKETT>is going to be enrolled there for much longer.

541
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,510
<20-10,WHITMAN>好吧  听我说
<20-10,WHITMAN>Okay, okay, okay. Look, look, look.

542
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:53,550
<20-10,WHITMAN>是她来找我的  好吗
<20-10,WHITMAN>She came to me, okay?

543
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,890
<20-10,WHITMAN>她想让我帮她在拉德诺做点事
<20-10,WHITMAN>She wanted me to pull some strings at Radnor,

544
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:58,100
<20-10,WHITMAN>作为回报  她接收我的孩子入园
<20-10,WHITMAN>and in return, she got my kid in.

545
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,680
<20-11,BECKETT>她希望你做什么事
<20-11,BECKETT>What strings did she want you to pull?

546
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,600
<20-12,WHITMAN>她让我联系教导主任
<20-12,WHITMAN>She wanted me to contact the dean of students

547
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,120
<20-12,WHITMAN>告诉他莎娜要去见他
<20-12,WHITMAN>to tell him Shana was coming to see him

548
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,510
<20-12,WHITMAN>她需要他帮忙做些事情
<20-12,WHITMAN>and that she needed help with something.

549
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:06,240
<20-13,BECKETT>她到底需要他帮什么忙
<20-13,BECKETT>And what exactly did she need help with?

550
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,360
<20-13,BECKETT>她不肯告诉我
<20-13,BECKETT>She wouldn't tell me.

551
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:09,920
<20-14,WHITMAN>她只让我给教导主任打电话
<20-14,WHITMAN>She just asked me to make the phone call to the dean.

552
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,780
<20-14,WHITMAN>我只知道这些  我发誓
<20-14,WHITMAN>That's all I know, I swear.

553
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,360
<20-15,WHITMAN>没事了吧
<20-15,WHITMAN>So we're good, right?

554
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,740
<20-15,WHITMAN>我儿子不会被开除吧
<20-15,WHITMAN>My son's still in?

555
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:20,380
<21-1,BECKETT>教导主任证实莎娜昨天的确在那里
<21-1,BECKETT>The dean confirmed that Shana was there yesterday,

556
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:23,760
<21-1,BECKETT>要求查看拉德诺的校警文件
<21-1,BECKETT>requesting access to Radnor campus police files.

557
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,140
<21-2,RYAN>校警文件  哪一起
<21-2,RYAN>Police files? Which ones?

558
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:27,490
<21-3,BECKETT>他不知道  不过据档案室的人说
<21-3,BECKETT>He didn't know, but according to their records room,

559
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:30,690
<21-3,BECKETT>她查看的是从1999年开始的案件
<21-3,BECKETT>she looked through incident reports from 1999.

560
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:34,430
<21-4,ESPOSITO>她为什么要查看15年前的案件报告
<21-4,ESPOSITO>Why would she be looking at 15-year-old incident reports?

561
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:35,580
<21-5,RYAN>我打赌卡塞尔肯定知道
<21-5,RYAN>I bet Castle knows.

562
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:37,280
<21-6,ESPOSITO>你真的假的啊
<21-6,ESPOSITO>Are you kidding me?

563
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,420
<21-6,ESPOSITO>这次他绝不可能赶在我们前面
<21-6,ESPOSITO>There is no way he's ahead of us on this.

564
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:41,530
<21-7,RYAN>他先去了停尸间  又先找到了律师啊
<21-7,RYAN>Hey, he got to the morgue before us and that lawyer.

565
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:44,770
<21-8,BECKETT>莱恩  他是机智  但还没这么机智
<21-8,BECKETT>Ryan, he is resourceful, but he is not that resourceful.

566
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:46,160
<21-9,RYAN>他不是把你骗到手了吗
<21-9,RYAN>He got you to marry him, didn't he?

567
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,430
<21-10,ESPOSITO>打给他
<21-10,ESPOSITO>Call him.

568
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,530
<21-10,ESPOSITO>看看他查的怎么样了
<21-10,ESPOSITO>We'll see where he's at.

569
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:49,340
<21-11,BECKETT>我才刚刚说不让他参与
<21-11,BECKETT>I just cut him out of the case.

570
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:51,490
<21-11,BECKETT>怎么打给他问他进度啊
<21-11,BECKETT>I can't call him and ask him what he knows.

571
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,670
<21-12,ESPOSITO>那就别明着问
<21-12,ESPOSITO>Then don't ask him.

572
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,830
<21-12,ESPOSITO>你不是侦探吗  用点手段
<21-12,ESPOSITO>You're a detective. Detect.

573
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:58,420
<22-1,CASTLE>谢谢你送饭来
<22-1,CASTLE>Thank you for picking up dinner.

574
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,910
<22-2,ALEXIS CASTLE>我怕你被私家侦探的微薄薪水饿死了
<22-2,ALEXIS CASTLE>I didn't want you to starve on that P.I. salary.

575
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,630
<22-3,ALEXIS>那么  你的第一个案子查的如何了
<22-3,ALEXIS>So, how is your first case going?

576
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:05,470
<22-4,CASTLE>我有没有告诉你  我今天被胡椒水喷了
<22-4,CASTLE>Did I tell you - I got pepper-sprayed today?

577
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:06,750
<22-5,ALEXIS>你怎么说的跟好事似的
<22-5,ALEXIS>You say that like it's a good thing.

578
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,990
<22-6,CASTLE>是啊  我现在是有点卡住了
<22-6,CASTLE>Yeah. I mean, now I'm kind of stuck.

<22-6,CASTLE>我知道死者去了一趟拉德诺大学
<22-6,CASTLE>I know our victim took a trip to Radnor university.

580
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,870
<22-6,CASTLE>只是还不知道为什么
<22-6,CASTLE>I just have no idea why.

581

<22-6,CASTLE>我侵入了她的社交媒体帐号
<22-6,CASTLE>I hacked into her social-media accounts.

<22-7,ALEXIS>等等  你知道怎么侵入社交媒体帐号
<22-7,ALEXIS>Wait. You know how to hack into social-media accounts?

583
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,160
<22-8,CASTLE>侵入这个词可能重了
<22-8,CASTLE>"Hacking" might be overstating it.

584
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,470
<22-8,CASTLE>她的所有密码都是闪闪  她的狗的名字
<22-8,CASTLE>Her password for everything is "Sparkles," Her dog's name.

585
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,140
<22-10,CASTLE>重点在于  没有警方的帮助
<22-10,CASTLE>Point is, without police resources,

586
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,710
<22-10,CASTLE>我能做到的也就只有
<22-10,CASTLE>the best I can do is

587
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:27,780
<22-10,CASTLE>浏览她朋友们在网上的发布
<22-10,CASTLE>go through her friends' online posts

588
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:30,870
<22-10,CASTLE>试着去找其中和拉德诺大学的联系
<22-10,CASTLE>and look for some connections to Radnor university.

<22-11,ALEXIS>-找到了吗  -只有一条
<22-11,ALEXIS>- Are there any? - Just one thing.

00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:33,680
<22-12,CASTLE>但那是15年前的事了
<22-12,CASTLE>But it happened 15 years ago.

591
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,210
<22-12,CASTLE>我完全不知道这之间到底有什么联系
<22-12,CASTLE>I have no idea if it's even relevant.

592
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:36,920
<22-12,CASTLE>真希望我知道贝克特的进度如何了
<22-12,CASTLE>I just wish I knew what Beckett had.

633
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:07,810
<27-9,BECKETT>你不会是想借酒
<27-9,BECKETT>You're not trying to ply me with wine

634
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:10,380
<27-9,BECKETT>从我这套出关于案子的情况吧
<27-9,BECKETT>to find out what I know about this case, are you?

635
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,070
<27-10,CASTLE>当然不是
<27-10,CASTLE>Of course not.

636
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:13,250
<27-10,CASTLE>这不会是  你想要干的事吧
<27-10,CASTLE>That's not what you're trying to do, is it?

00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:14,870
<27-11,BECKETT>-不是  -好吧
<27-11,BECKETT>- No. - Okay.

638
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:18,690
<27-12,CASTLE>因为如果你是想要知道我的进度
<27-12,CASTLE>Because if you were trying to find out what I know,

639
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,320
<27-12,CASTLE>那就说明你是卡住了
<27-12,CASTLE>that would mean you're stuck.

640
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:24,220
<27-13,BECKETT>我没有卡住
<27-13,BECKETT>I am not stuck.

641
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:27,530
<27-14,CASTLE>很好  因为我也没有卡住
<27-14,CASTLE>Good, because I'm not stuck either.

644
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,350
<27-18,CASTLE>好了  这太傻了
<27-18,CASTLE>All right, this is crazy.

645
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,170
<27-19,CASTLE>如果我们都查到了什么
<27-19,CASTLE>If we both have something,

646
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,580
<27-19,CASTLE>不如互换吧
<27-19,CASTLE>why don't we just trade?

647
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:37,290
<27-20,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我不能这么做  你知道的
<27-20,BECKETT>Castle, I can't. You know that.

00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,490
<27-20,BECKETT>不能这么做
<27-20,BECKETT>Oh, "Can't."

<27-21,CASTLE>桀骜不驯的女孩哪去了
<27-21,CASTLE>with the leather jacket and the motorcycle?

651
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,310
<27-21,CASTLE>她会说不能这么做这种话吗
<27-21,CASTLE>Would she say "Can't"?

652
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:46,320
<27-22,BECKETT>她现在是喝着高级红酒的执法人员了
<27-22,BECKETT>She enforces the law now and drinks expensive wine.

653
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:49,070
<27-23,CASTLE>那想想死者吧
<27-23,CASTLE>Then think about our victim.

654
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:51,980
<27-23,CASTLE>你真的要让一些无聊的规矩
<27-23,CASTLE>Are you really gonna let a couple of silly rules

655
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:54,800
<27-23,CASTLE>阻碍你为莎娜伸张正义吗

<27-24,BECKETT>好吧
<27-24,BECKETT>Okay, fine.

657
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:00,650
<27-24,BECKETT>仅此一次  为了死者
<27-24,BECKETT>We'll do it just this once... for her.

<27-30,CASTLE>莎娜的男友死在了拉德诺大学
<27-30,CASTLE>She had an old boyfriend who died at Radnor university?

<27-33,CASTLE>他在派对上醉酒跌出了窗户
<27-33,CASTLE>He drank too much at a party and fell out a window.

668
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:20,310
<27-34,BECKETT>如果说她在调查警方案件记录
<27-34,BECKETT>If she was looking into old police records...

<27-35,CASTLE>而且还对谋杀法律感兴趣
<27-35,CASTLE>And interested in homicide law...

670
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,830
<27-36,BECKETT>她肯定是认为他的死
<27-36,BECKETT>She must have thought that his death

671
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,510
<27-36,BECKETT>并非意外
<27-36,BECKETT>was more than just an accident.

672
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:25,620
<27-37,CASTLE>她是在调查谋杀案
<27-37,CASTLE>She was investigating a murder.

673
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:27,700
<27-38,BECKETT>但这调查却害死了她
<27-38,BECKETT>And somehow that got her killed.

674
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,380
<27-39,CASTLE>天呐  真怀念这个
<27-39,CASTLE>Oh, my god. I missed this.

677
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:40,880
<28-2,BECKETT>交流办案进展  还是说
<28-2,BECKETT>the put-together we did on the case, or...?

<28-3,CASTLE>但交流办案进展也很棒
<28-3,CASTLE>But the put-together, that was pretty amazing, too.

680
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:48,030
<28-4,BECKETT>都好久没这样做过了
<28-4,BECKETT>It's been forever since we tried that.

<28-4,BECKETT>我都忘记你这么有创意了
<28-4,BECKETT>I forgot how creative you can get.

<28-5,CASTLE>我们说的不是案子了吧
<28-5,CASTLE>Oh, we're not talking about the case anymore, are we?

689
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,830
<28-10,BECKETT>昨晚你给莱恩发了短信让他去
<28-10,BECKETT>Oh, you texted Ryan last night about Shana's old boyfriend

690
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:17,970
<28-11,CASTLE>给你调莎娜男友的案件记录
<28-11,CASTLE>and told him to get those old police files for you...

691
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:19,710
<28-11,CASTLE>-什么  -而你却和我在床上
<28-11,CASTLE>- Wha...? - While you were in bed with me.

692
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,670
<28-12,BECKETT>我  莱恩  我马上到
<28-12,BECKETT>I -- Ryan, I'll be right over.

693
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:24,480
<28-13,CASTLE>你得让我看一眼记录吧
<28-13,CASTLE>Well, you're gonna let me take a look at those files, right?

694
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,710
<28-13,CASTLE>这才公平
<28-13,CASTLE>I mean, that's only fair.

695
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,680
<28-13,CASTLE>卡索尔  我不能这么做
<28-13,CASTLE>Castle. I can't.

696
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,820
<28-14,BECKETT>那可越界了
<28-14,BECKETT>That would be crossing the line.

697
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,600
<28-15,CASTLE>你昨晚好像不怎么在意界限啊
<28-15,CASTLE>You didn't seem to care about lines last night.

698
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:34,500
<28-15,CASTLE>昨晚  什么都行
<28-15,CASTLE>No, last night, it was anything goes.

699
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:38,520
<28-16,BECKETT>是的  卡塞尔  昨晚很棒
<28-16,BECKETT>Yes, Castle. And it was great.

700
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,800
<28-16,BECKETT>算了吧
<28-16,BECKETT>Come on.

701
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:43,510
<28-16,BECKETT>我们都明白只能仅此一次
<28-16,BECKETT>We both know it was just a one-time thing.

702
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,380
<28-17,CASTLE>我还以为咱俩来电了呢
<28-17,CASTLE>You know, I thought we had something special!

703
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:50,690
<29-1,BECKETT>是那份文件吗
<29-1,BECKETT>Is that the file?

704
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,720
<29-2,RYAN>看来你凌晨两点那时的灵感还是有收获的
<29-2,RYAN>Yeah, and it looks like your 2:00 a.m. hunch paid off.

705
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,260
<29-2,RYAN>不管怎样  你这么晚在干什么
<29-2,RYAN>What were you doing up so late, anyway?

706
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,560
<29-3,BECKETT>我在研究那个案子
<29-3,BECKETT>I was working on the case.

707
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:59,790
<29-4,RYAN>我不知道莎娜在那份报告里
<29-4,RYAN>Well, I don't know - what Shana was looking to find

708
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:00,850
<29-4,RYAN>要找的东西是什么
<29-4,RYAN>in that report,

709
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:03,370
<29-4,RYAN>但文件是关于一个派对的证人证词
<29-4,RYAN>but it refers to witness statements

710
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:04,790
<29-4,RYAN>莎娜的男朋友
<29-4,RYAN>taken at the party

711
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:07,120
<29-4,RYAN>杰夫·韦兰在这次派对中死掉了
<29-4,RYAN>where Shana's boyfriend, Jeff Whalen, died.

712
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,230
<29-4,RYAN>但这份证词
<29-4,RYAN>But the witness statements,

713
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:10,060
<29-4,RYAN>还有作证的那些人
<29-4,RYAN>as well as the list of people who gave them,

714
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,190
<29-4,RYAN>都失踪了
<29-4,RYAN>they're all missing.

715
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:13,610
<29-5,BECKETT>-文件被篡改了吗  -看上去应该是的
<29-5,BECKETT>- The file's been tampered with? - It looks that way.

716
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:15,720
<29-6,RYAN>我打给拉德诺大学时  他们说这几页
<29-6,RYAN>When I called over to Radnor, they said that those pages

717
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,110
<29-6,RYAN>肯定是丢失了的
<29-6,RYAN>must have been "lost"

718
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,780
<29-6,RYAN>当十年前他们把档案数字化的时候
<29-6,RYAN>when their records were digitized 10 years ago.

719
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,710
<29-7,BECKETT>那个当时写这份报告的官员呢
<29-7,BECKETT>What about the officer that wrote the original report?

720
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,880
<29-8,RYAN>几年前就去世了
<29-8,RYAN>Passed away a few years back.

721
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,170
<29-9,BECKETT>如果信息丢失了的话
<29-9,BECKETT>Okay, if the information is missing,

722
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:26,500
<29-9,BECKETT>莎娜在报告里知道了什么而被人灭口了呢
<29-9,BECKETT>then what did Shana learn from this report that got her killed?

723
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,200
<29-10,RYAN>据在档案室工作的人说
<29-10,RYAN>According to the guy in the records department,

724
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,590
<29-10,RYAN>莎娜看完了档案后
<29-10,RYAN>when Shana finished with the archive,

725
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:31,540
<29-10,RYAN>她问了校友办公室在哪里
<29-10,RYAN>she asked for directions to the alumni office.

726
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:32,800
<29-10,RYAN>我给那里打了电话
<29-10,RYAN>I-I placed a call over there,

727
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,710
<29-10,RYAN>但他们大概半个小时后才上班
<29-10,RYAN>but they don't open for another half an hour or so.

728
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:38,290
<29-10,RYAN>对了  昨晚和卡塞尔怎么样了
<29-10,RYAN>Oh. How'd it go with Castle last night?

729
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:39,770
<29-10,RYAN>他在我们前头还是落后于我们
<29-10,RYAN>Is he ahead of us or behind us?

730
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:41,780
<29-11,BECKETT>我们肯定在他之上
<29-11,BECKETT>Uh, we're definitely on top of him.

732
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:45,280
<30-1,CASTLE>查不了警方的文档
<30-1,CASTLE>Without access to those police files,

733
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,040
<30-1,CASTLE>我肯定被他们甩到后面去了
<30-1,CASTLE>they are gonna leave me in the dust.

734
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,160
<30-2,ALEXIS>我以为你当私家侦探是想和贝克特一起办案
<30-2,ALEXIS>I thought you became a P.I. to work with Beckett.

735
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,770
<30-2,ALEXIS>什么时候这变成比赛了
<30-2,ALEXIS>When did it become a competition?

736
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:53,260
<30-3,CASTLE>当她把我和她创造的美好
<30-3,CASTLE>When she took something beautiful

737
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:55,780
<30-3,CASTLE>分享给了另外一个男人
<30-3,CASTLE>that we'd built together and shared it with another man.

738
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:56,600
<30-4,ALEXIS>什么
<30-4,ALEXIS>What?

739
00:27:57,690 --> 00:27:58,950
<30-5,CASTLE>从调查的角度来说
<30-5,CASTLE>Investigatively speaking.

740
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,070
<30-6,CASTLE>但我好像找到了赶上他们的办法
<30-6,CASTLE>But...I may have found a way to catch up.

741
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:06,200
<30-6,CASTLE>我在搜索任何提到
<30-6,CASTLE>I have been looking for any mention

742
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,740
<30-6,CASTLE>莎娜男朋友死亡的消息
<30-6,CASTLE>of Shana's boyfriend's death --

743
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:10,650
<30-6,CASTLE>报纸  公共档案及其他地方我都查了
<30-6,CASTLE>wading through newspapers, public records, and the like.

744
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:12,010
<30-6,CASTLE>看一下这个
<30-6,CASTLE>And check this out.

745
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,980
<30-6,CASTLE>是从《拉德诺大学日报》里找到的
<30-6,CASTLE>It's from the Radnor University Daily.

746
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,070
<30-7,CASTLE>你注意到这则广告上有不对劲的地方吗
<30-7,CASTLE>Do you notice anything unusual about this ad?

748
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:22,730
<30-8,ALEXIS>大家都害怕千年虫的这件事吗
<30-8,ALEXIS>That people were ever actually afraid of Y2K?

749
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:26,500
<30-9,CASTLE>是的  还有这则广告在上半版版面
<30-9,CASTLE>Yes, that, and the ad is above the fold.

750
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,570
<30-9,CASTLE>我在校报工作过
<30-9,CASTLE>I worked on my school paper.

751
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:29,590
<30-9,CASTLE>版面布局入门知识
<30-9,CASTLE>That's layout 101 --

752
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:32,620
<30-9,CASTLE>永远都不要把广告放在头版的上半版
<30-9,CASTLE>You never place an ad above the fold on the front page --

753
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:35,470
<30-9,CASTLE>除非有什么东西在最后一刻发生了变化
<30-9,CASTLE>Unless something changed, last-minute,

754
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:36,570
<30-9,CASTLE>多出来一个空要补上
<30-9,CASTLE>creating a space to fill.

755
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:37,780
<30-10,ALEXIS>比如头条新闻缩短了
<30-10,ALEXIS>Like the lead story was shortened.

756
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:38,810
<30-11,CASTLE>有些东西被撤掉了
<30-11,CASTLE>Something was pulled from it

757
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:39,720
<30-11,CASTLE>就在出版之前
<30-11,CASTLE>just before they published,

758
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,800
<30-11,CASTLE>我敢保证这肯定和这个案件有关
<30-11,CASTLE>and I bet it relates to this case.

759
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,360
<30-12,ALEXIS>你可以查出这篇报道的作者
<30-12,ALEXIS>You could track down the reporter,

760
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,290
<30-12,ALEXIS>看他能不能告诉你
<30-12,ALEXIS>see if he could tell you.

761
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:46,600
<30-13,CASTLE>可这条新闻的署名是工作人员
<30-13,CASTLE>Except the story is credited to "Staff."

762
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,240
<30-13,CASTLE>但肯定有其他人知道
<30-13,CASTLE>But there is someone else who knows.

763
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:49,280
<30-15,CASTLE>-谁  -那个最初要求
<30-15,CASTLE>- Who? - The person who ordered

764
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,090
<30-15,CASTLE>缩短文章的人
<30-15,CASTLE>the article shortened in the first place --

765
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:53,290
<30-15,CASTLE>编辑
<30-15,CASTLE>The editor.

766
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,370
<31-1,ESPOSITO>弗兰克·杰克逊
<31-1,ESPOSITO>Frank Jackson?

767
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:55,990
<31-2,RYAN>对  校友办公室的人说
<31-2,RYAN>Yeah, the guy at the alumni office

768
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:57,020
<31-2,RYAN>莎娜一进门
<31-2,RYAN>said that Shana came in

769
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:59,180
<31-2,RYAN>就要求找到所有他的联系方式
<31-2,RYAN>requesting all of his contact information.

770
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,050
<31-1,ESPOSITO>弗兰克·杰克逊
<31-1,ESPOSITO>Frank Jackson?

771
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:01,540
<31-3,BECKETT>怎么听起来这么熟呢
<31-3,BECKETT>Why does that sound so familiar?

772
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:05,190
<31-4,RYAN>因为他现在是《纽约文汇》的一名记者
<31-4,RYAN>Because he is now a reporter at the New York Ledger.

773
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,530
<31-5,ESPOSITO>他就是莎娜被杀害那天联系过的人
<31-5,ESPOSITO>That's who Shana was calling the day she died.

774
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:09,250
<31-6,RYAN>我知道是怎么回事  十五年前
<31-6,RYAN>And I can tell you why -- 15 years ago,

775
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:10,440
<31-6,RYAN>弗兰克·杰克逊是
<31-6,RYAN>Frank Jackson was the president

776
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,880
<31-6,RYAN>入会严格的虎爪社交俱乐部主席
<31-6,RYAN>of the exclusive Tiger Claw Social Club,

777
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,900
<31-6,RYAN>就是这家俱乐部当时举办了那场派对
<31-6,RYAN>the organization that hosted the party

778
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:16,320
<31-6,RYAN>莎娜男朋友意外身亡
<31-6,RYAN>where Shana's boyfriend died.

779
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,570
<31-7,BECKETT>为了调查  莎娜给弗兰克打了电话
<31-7,BECKETT>So, Shana called Frank as part of her investigation.

780
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:20,730
<31-7,BECKETT>她知道如果他是当时俱乐部的主席
<31-7,BECKETT>She knew that if he was president of that club,

781
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:22,380
<31-7,BECKETT>他当晚肯定在派对上
<31-7,BECKETT>he must have been at the party that night.

782
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:24,540
<31-8,ESPOSITO>如果其中有所隐瞒  他肯定知道内情
<31-8,ESPOSITO>And if there was a cover-up, he would've been in on it.

783
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:25,750
<31-9,BECKETT>那他就有可能是凶手
<31-9,BECKETT>Then he could be our killer.

784
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:34,740
<32-1,CASTLE>不好意思  杰克逊先生
<32-1,CASTLE>Excuse me! Mr. Jackson!

00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:49,140
<32-3,CASTLE>你省略了文章中的一些内容  对吧
<32-3,CASTLE>You left something out of that article, didn't you?

790
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:53,800
<32-3,CASTLE>关于杰夫·韦兰死亡的真相
<32-3,CASTLE>Something about - how Jeff Whalen really died.

<32-6,FRANK>好  不在这谈  我知道附近有个地方
<32-6,FRANK>Okay. Not here. I know somewhere nearby.

795
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:04,530
<32-6,FRANK>更隐秘一些
<32-6,FRANK>It's more private.

796
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:13,190
<33-1,RYAN>我们还没找到杰克逊
<33-1,RYAN>We still can't find Jackson.

00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:20,640
<33-3,ESPOSITO>《纽约文汇》的电话
<33-3,ESPOSITO>Yo. That was Ledger.

802
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:22,320
<33-3,ESPOSITO>杰克逊的一位同事说他看见
<33-3,ESPOSITO>One of Jackson's coworkers said that he saw him

803
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,820
<33-3,ESPOSITO>杰克逊一小时前和一个长得像卡塞尔的人
<33-3,ESPOSITO>leave the building about an hour ago

804
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:25,150
<33-3,ESPOSITO>离开了大楼
<33-3,ESPOSITO>with some guy who looked like Castle.

805
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:26,320
<33-4,RYAN>卡塞尔找到了杰克逊吗
<33-4,RYAN>Castle found Jackson?

806
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:28,810
<33-5,BECKETT>他完全不知道那人有多危险
<33-5,BECKETT>And he has no idea how dangerous he is.

807
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:32,740
<33-5,BECKETT>该死  卡塞尔  快接电话啊
<33-5,BECKETT>Damn it, Castle, answer.

808
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,350
<33-5,BECKETT>他怎么就不能不插手这件事呢
<33-5,BECKETT>Why can't he just stay out of this?

809
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,900
<33-6,CASTLE>我什么时候不管过这些事情
<33-6,CASTLE>When have I ever stayed out of anything?

810
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,510
<33-7,BECKETT>谢天谢地
<33-7,BECKETT>Oh, thank God.

811
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:40,540
<33-7,BECKETT>你在这里做什么
<33-7,BECKETT>Now, what are you doing here?

812
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:42,980
<33-8,CASTLE>我懂规矩  但考虑到和我一块来的人
<33-8,CASTLE>I know the rules, but, uh, given who I'm with,

813
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,490
<33-8,CASTLE>我想我们可以破个例
<33-8,CASTLE>I thought we might make an exception.

814
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:48,760
<34-1,FRANK>我知道这天会来的
<34-1,FRANK>I knew this day would come.

815
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:50,360
<34-1,FRANK>当莎娜那晚打电话给我时
<34-1,FRANK>When Shana called the other night,

816
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,030
<34-1,FRANK>我几乎松了一口气
<34-1,FRANK>I was almost relieved.

817
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:53,090
<34-2,CASTLE>就告诉贝克特探长
<34-2,CASTLE>Just tell detective Beckett

818
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:55,040
<34-2,CASTLE>你告诉我关于莎娜打电话的原因
<34-2,CASTLE>what you told me about why she called.

819
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,120
<34-3,FRANK>是关于她的男朋友
<34-3,FRANK>It was about her boyfriend.

820
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:58,470
<34-3,FRANK>她想知道杰夫·韦兰
<34-3,FRANK>She wanted to know how Jeff Whalen really died

821
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,050
<34-3,FRANK>那晚在拉德诺大学的真正死因
<34-3,FRANK>that night at Radnor university.

822
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:01,230
<34-3,FRANK>杰夫那晚烂醉
<34-3,FRANK>Jeff was pretty wasted.

823
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:02,500
<34-3,FRANK>他上楼去透气
<34-3,FRANK>Uh, he went upstairs to get some air.

824
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:05,100
<34-3,FRANK>我记得接着就听到一声尖叫
<34-3,FRANK>And the next thing I remember was the scream.

825
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:06,470
<34-3,FRANK>我没有看到发生了什么
<34-3,FRANK>Now, I didn't see what happened,

826
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:08,170
<34-3,FRANK>但我知道杰夫摔下窗户时
<34-3,FRANK>But I know Jeff wasn't alone in that room

827
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:09,310
<34-3,FRANK>他不是独自一人在房间
<34-3,FRANK>when he fell out the window.

828
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:11,120
<34-4,BECKETT>你认为他是被谋杀的吗
<34-4,BECKETT>You think that he was murdered?

829
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:12,190
<34-5,FRANK>我只知道第二天
<34-5,FRANK>All I know is the next day,

830
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:13,770
<34-5,FRANK>我迫于压力要修改那条新闻
<34-5,FRANK>I was pressured to change the story.

831
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:15,580
<34-5,FRANK>有人让我把任何提到
<34-5,FRANK>I was told to take out any mention

832
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:16,850
<34-5,FRANK>是谁和杰夫一同在房间的信息删除
<34-5,FRANK>of who was in the room with him.

833
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:18,050
<34-6,BECKETT>等等  谁给你施压
<34-6,BECKETT>Wait. Who pressured you?

834
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:19,190
<34-7,FRANK>某个大人物
<34-7,FRANK>Someone big.

835
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:22,800
<34-7,FRANK>他说他只是想保全他儿子的名誉
<34-7,FRANK>He said he was just trying to protect his son's reputation.

836
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,690
<34-7,FRANK>他说他可以毁了我的人生
<34-7,FRANK>He told me he could ruin my life...

837
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:30,870
<34-7,FRANK>或是助我成就大事
<34-7,FRANK>or he could do great things for me.

838
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:33,180
<34-7,FRANK>我当时只是个孩子  我吓坏了
<34-7,FRANK>I was a kid, and I was scared.

839
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:36,430
<34-7,FRANK>我想既然警察已经宣布那只是个意外
<34-7,FRANK>And since the cops already said that it was an accident,

840
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:38,510
<34-7,FRANK>何必毁了两个人的人生呢
<34-7,FRANK>I figured why ruin two lives?

841
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,180
<34-8,BECKETT>只不过那不是场意外
<34-8,BECKETT>Only it wasn't an accident.

842
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:44,530
<34-9,FRANK>当我发现警方的调查被人做了手脚时
<34-9,FRANK>By the time I had realized the investigation had been...

843
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,380
<34-9,FRANK>我已经成了帮人掩盖谋杀的从犯
<34-9,FRANK>rigged, I had already helped to cover up a murder.

844
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,850
<34-10,CASTLE>如果你站出来
<34-10,CASTLE>And if you had come forward,

845
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,360
<34-10,CASTLE>你的记者事业也就结束了
<34-10,CASTLE>your career as a journalist would be over.

846
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,300
<34-10,CASTLE>没错
<34-10,CASTLE>Exactly.

847
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:57,320
<34-11,FRANK>可我不能再逃避下去了
<34-11,FRANK>I can't hide from it anymore, you know.

848
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:58,910
<34-12,BECKETT>他们在保护谁  弗兰克
<34-12,BECKETT>Who were they protecting, Frank?

849
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:01,120
<34-12,BECKETT>谁把莎娜的男友推出了窗外
<34-12,BECKETT>Who pushed Shana's boyfriend out the window?

850
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:05,780
<34-13,FRANK>上一个问我这个问题的人死了
<34-13,FRANK>Last person I told that, um, wound up dead.

851
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:08,620
<34-13,FRANK>你确定你想知道吗
<34-13,FRANK>I mean, you sure you really want to know?

852
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,510
<35-1,GATES>咱们把话说明白
<35-1,GATES>Let me get this straight.

853
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:15,830
<35-1,GATES>你认为联邦检察官斯伯丁·埃利奥特
<35-1,GATES>You think federal prosecutor Spalding Elliot

854
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:17,010
<35-1,GATES>杀害了莎娜·贝克
<35-1,GATES>killed Shana Baker?

855
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:18,460
<35-2,BECKETT>这正是事实所指
<35-2,BECKETT>The events support it, sir.

856
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:21,790
<35-2,BECKETT>据杰克逊先生说  莎娜找过他之后
<35-2,BECKETT>According to Mr. Jackson, right after Shana spoke to him,

857
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:23,710
<35-2,BECKETT>就直接去找埃利奥特对质
<35-2,BECKETT>she went to confront Elliot about his role

858
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:25,340
<35-2,BECKETT>问他是否和她男友的死有关
<35-2,BECKETT>in her former boyfriend's death.

859
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:26,920
<35-3,CASTLE>他孩子在她所在的学校上学
<35-3,CASTLE>And he's a parent at her school,

860
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,040
<35-3,CASTLE>所以她知道他的联系方式
<35-3,CASTLE>so she knew where to find him.

861
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:29,250
<35-4,BECKETT>众所周知
<35-4,BECKETT>Look, it -- it's no secret

862
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:31,810
<35-4,BECKETT>埃利奥特正欲大展宏图
<35-4,BECKETT>that Elliot is being groomed for bigger things,

863
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:34,390
<35-4,BECKETT>也许他必须要将莎娜封口
<35-4,BECKETT>so maybe he needed to silence Shana

864
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:35,850
<35-4,BECKETT>以防她毁了自己
<35-4,BECKETT>to keep her from destroying him.

865
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:38,250
<35-5,GATES>探长  如果你要指控
<35-5,GATES>Detective, if you're gonna go after

866
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:40,680
<35-5,GATES>纽约市最出色的联邦检察官
<35-5,GATES>the top federal prosecutor in New York,

867
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,540
<35-5,GATES>只凭一个违反了职业道德的记者的几句话
<35-5,GATES>you're gonna need more than just the word

868
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:44,130
<35-5,GATES>是远远不够的
<35-5,GATES>of a compromised journalist.

869
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:46,180
<35-5,GATES>得有铁证
<35-5,GATES>You're gonna need bullet-proof evidence,

870
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,940
<35-5,GATES>可你没有
<35-5,GATES>and you don't have it.

871
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:50,070
<35-6,BECKETT>如果我们能证明埃利奥特在案发现场呢
<35-6,BECKETT>What if we can place Elliot at the crime scene?

872
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:53,860
<35-6,BECKETT>我们找到了一个有DNA证据的烟头
<35-6,BECKETT>We found a cigarette butt with DNA evidence on it.

873
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,630
<35-7,GATES>你准备怎么跟他做比对呢
<35-7,GATES>Which you're gonna match to his how?

874
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:59,830
<35-7,GATES>如果他是凶手  他肯定不会自愿提供DNA样本
<35-7,GATES>I doubt if he's gonna volunteer his DNA if he's guilty.

875
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:00,630
<35-8,BECKETT>我们会想办法的
<35-8,BECKETT>We'll find a way.

876
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:01,870
<35-9,GATES>谨慎为之  警探
<35-9,GATES>Tread lightly, detective.

877
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:03,860
<35-9,GATES>你的对手可不容小觑
<35-9,GATES>You're hunting big game here.

878
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:06,280
<35-9,GATES>在我们获得更多证据前
<35-9,GATES>And until we have a stronger case,

879
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,670
<35-9,GATES>绝不能引起注意
<35-9,GATES>we cannot afford to attract any attention,

880
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:10,860
<35-9,GATES>也就是说  卡塞尔先生
<35-9,GATES>which means, Mr. Castle,

881
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:13,200
<35-9,GATES>你跟这个案子不得有半点关系
<35-9,GATES>you cannot be involved in this at all,

882
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,290
<35-9,GATES>即使你是私家侦探也不行
<35-9,GATES>even in your - private-investigator capacity.

883
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,210
<35-10,BECKETT>头  我们能查到这一步多亏了
<35-10,BECKETT>Sir, we never would have gotten this far without --

884
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:19,970
<35-11,CASTLE>不  她说得对
<35-11,CASTLE>Oh, no. Actually, uh, she's right.

885
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:21,590
<35-11,CASTLE>规定就是规定
<35-11,CASTLE>Rules are rules.

886
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:22,570
<35-11,CASTLE>实际上
<35-11,CASTLE>As a matter of fact,

887
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:23,980
<35-11,CASTLE>我现在都不应该在这
<35-11,CASTLE>I shouldn't even be here right now.

888
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:27,890
<35-12,GATES>这比我想象中容易多了
<35-12,GATES>Well, that was easier than I expected.

889
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:28,680
<35-12,GATES>是啊
<35-12,GATES>Yeah.

890
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,550
<35-12,GATES>丢啊
<35-12,GATES>Come on.

891
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,480
<35-12,GATES>丢啊
<35-12,GATES>Come on.

892
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:44,840
<35-12,GATES>好了
<35-12,GATES>There.

893
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:49,520
<36-1,CASTLE>DNA证据拿到了
<36-1,CASTLE>One sample of damning DNA evidence coming right up.

894
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:55,220
<36-2,ESPOSITO>抱歉  神探  这次不能让你了
<36-2,ESPOSITO>Sorry, Sherlock. Not this time.

895
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,740
<36-3,RYAN>下面该由专业人士接手了
<36-3,RYAN>Pros will take it from here.

896
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,150
<36-3,RYAN>一个烟头
<36-3,RYAN>A cigarette butt.

897
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:16,330
<37-1,SPAULDING ELLIOTT>这有什么含义吗
<37-1,SPAULDING ELLIOTT>Is that supposed to mean something?

898
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:18,540
<37-2,GATES>这是我们在莎娜·贝克的谋杀现场取回的
<37-2,GATES>It was recovered at the scene of Shana Baker's murder.

899
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:21,500
<37-2,GATES>初步的DNA检测证实这是你留下的
<37-2,GATES>Preliminary DNA tests indicate it's yours.

900
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:23,210
<37-3,ELLIOTT>这不可能
<37-3,ELLIOTT>That's not possible.

901
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:24,590
<37-4,BECKETT>可能  因为你就在现场
<37-4,BECKETT>It is, because you were there.

902
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:26,350
<37-4,BECKETT>你杀了她  埃利奥特先生
<37-4,BECKETT>You killed her, Mr. Elliot.

903
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:28,180
<37-5,ELLIOTT>这太荒唐了  我根本就不认识她
<37-5,ELLIOTT>That's ridiculous. I didn't even know her.

904
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:29,170
<37-5,ELLIOTT>我干吗要杀她
<37-5,ELLIOTT>Why would I kill her?

905
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:30,320
<37-6,GATES>因为她知道
<37-6,GATES>Because she knew the truth

906
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:32,390
<37-6,GATES>那晚在派对上发生的事情
<37-6,GATES>about what happened that night at the party,

907
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:33,860
<37-6,GATES>她知道杰夫·韦兰谋杀案的真相
<37-6,GATES>about Jeff Whalen's murder.

908
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:35,290
<37-7,BECKETT>我们知道她找到了你
<37-7,BECKETT>We know that she tracked you down,

909
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:37,430
<37-7,BECKETT>当她找你对质时  你杀了她灭口
<37-7,BECKETT>and when she confronted you, you had her silenced.

910
00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:38,340
<37-8,ELLIOTT>听着
<37-8,ELLIOTT>Okay, listen.

911
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:40,160
<37-8,ELLIOTT>没错  她是找到了我
<37-8,ELLIOTT>Okay. She did track me down.

912
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,820
<37-8,ELLIOTT>她那晚就等在
<37-8,ELLIOTT>And she practically accosted me

913
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:43,280
<37-8,ELLIOTT>我办公室门口堵我
<37-8,ELLIOTT>in front of my office the other night.

914
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:46,000
<37-8,ELLIOTT>可我把真相都告诉她了
<37-8,ELLIOTT>And I told her the truth, all right?

915
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,660
<37-8,ELLIOTT>没错  杰夫坠楼那晚
<37-8,ELLIOTT>That -- that I -- yes, I was in the room

916
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:48,720
<37-8,ELLIOTT>我是在屋里
<37-8,ELLIOTT>the night that Jeff fell,

917
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,810
<37-8,ELLIOTT>但我没有推他
<37-8,ELLIOTT>but I did not push him.

918
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:51,940
<37-8,ELLIOTT>那是个意外  警方报告中都写了
<37-8,ELLIOTT>It was an accident. It's in the report.

919
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:53,500
<37-9,GATES>那你父亲为什么要掩盖这件事
<37-9,GATES>Then why did your father cover it up?

920
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,380
<37-10,ELLIOTT>因为他知道真相并不重要
<37-10,ELLIOTT>Because he knew that the truth wouldn't matter,

921
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:57,460
<37-10,ELLIOTT>大众会仅仅因为我当时也在屋内
<37-10,ELLIOTT>that I would be convicted in the court of public opinion

922
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,720
<37-10,ELLIOTT>而认定我有罪
<37-10,ELLIOTT>just for being there,

923
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,170
<37-10,ELLIOTT>那样一来  我的政治生涯还没开始
<37-10,ELLIOTT>and that my political career would be over

924
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:01,290
<37-10,ELLIOTT>就要结束了
<37-10,ELLIOTT>before it ever started.

925
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:02,510
<37-11,BECKETT>于是你就掩盖了事实
<37-11,BECKETT>So you swept it under the rug,

926
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:03,860
<37-11,BECKETT>当莎娜找到你
<37-11,BECKETT>and then when Shana came along --

927
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,960
<37-11,BECKETT>她  你认为她是第一个为这事找我的人吗
<37-11,BECKETT>She -- do you -- do you think she was the first?

928
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:07,920
<37-12,ELLIOTT>多年来我的敌人
<37-12,ELLIOTT>Listen, my enemies have been circling

929
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,450
<37-12,ELLIOTT>一直追着这件事不放
<37-12,ELLIOTT>around this story for years.

930
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:11,190
<37-12,ELLIOTT>你知道为什么媒体一直没有报道此事吗
<37-12,ELLIOTT>And you want to know why the media's never run with it?

931
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:12,470
<37-12,ELLIOTT>因为根本就没什么好报道的
<37-12,ELLIOTT>Because there's nothing there.

933
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,060
<37-12,ELLIOTT>直至现在
<37-12,ELLIOTT>Until now.

934
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,130
<37-13,BECKETT>-有人陷害我  -埃利奥特先生
<37-13,BECKETT>- I'm being set up. - Mr. Elliot --

935
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:23,630
<37-14,ELLIOTT>莎娜说有人联系她
<37-14,ELLIOTT>Shana said somebody contacted her

936
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:25,700
<37-14,ELLIOTT>说是我把杰夫推下楼的
<37-14,ELLIOTT>and told her that I pushed Jeff.

937
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,750
<37-14,ELLIOTT>他们鼓励她去"查出真相"
<37-14,ELLIOTT>They urged her to "Look into the truth."

938
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,850
<37-14,ELLIOTT>然后她就死了
<37-14,ELLIOTT>And then -- then she ends up dead?

939
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:32,180
<37-14,ELLIOTT>接着你们就在现场找到这个
<37-14,ELLIOTT>And you find this at the scene?

940
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,810
<37-15,GATES>你声称有人在陷害你
<37-15,GATES>You're claiming someone is framing you?

941
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:35,250
<37-16,ELLIOTT>我是罪案检察官
<37-16,ELLIOTT>I am a criminal prosecutor.

942
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:37,410
<37-16,ELLIOTT>你们难道真的认为我会笨到
<37-16,ELLIOTT>Do you honestly think that I would be stupid enough

943
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:40,110
<37-16,ELLIOTT>在现场留下这种证据吗
<37-16,ELLIOTT>to leave a piece of evidence like this behind?

944
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:44,180
<37-16,ELLIOTT>我通过对抗企业的贪婪打响了名号
<37-16,ELLIOTT>Look, I make my name fighting corporate greed.

945
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:47,160
<37-16,ELLIOTT>我的政治野心也众所周知
<37-16,ELLIOTT>And my political ambitions are -- are no secret to anyone.

946
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,360
<37-16,ELLIOTT>这个  你们还不明白吗
<37-16,ELLIOTT>This -- don't you see?

947
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:51,400
<37-16,ELLIOTT>这是我的敌人毁掉我的最佳方法
<37-16,ELLIOTT>This -- this is the perfect way for my enemies to destroy me.

948
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,670
<37-17,GATES>你这推论有一个问题  埃利奥特先生
<37-17,GATES>Okay, there's only one problem with that theory, Mr. Elliot.

949
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:55,820
<37-17,GATES>想要陷害你
<37-17,GATES>In order to frame you,

950
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,630
<37-17,GATES>这个人必须得知道你十五年前
<37-17,GATES>a person would need to know that you were there

951
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,160
<37-17,GATES>出席了那个派对
<37-17,GATES>at that party 15 years ago

952
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,740
<37-17,GATES>还必须知道莎娜在回家一小时前
<37-17,GATES>and know that Shana Baker had just come from seeing you

953
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:02,960
<37-17,GATES>去见过你
<37-17,GATES>an hour earlier.

954
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,020
<37-18,BECKETT>也许有更简单的解释
<37-18,BECKETT>Maybe there is a simpler explanation.

955
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:08,590
<37-18,BECKETT>这根本就不是针对你的阴谋
<37-18,BECKETT>There is no conspiracy against you.

956
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:09,700
<37-18,BECKETT>你就是杀害她的凶手
<37-18,BECKETT>You killed her.

957
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:11,920
<37-19,ELLIOTT>我不可能杀她
<37-19,ELLIOTT>You know, I-I couldn't have killed her

958
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,510
<37-19,ELLIOTT>因为那晚在参加筹款活动
<37-19,ELLIOTT>because I was at a fundraiser that night.

959
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:16,120
<37-20,BECKETT>我们查过了  你是十一点到的
<37-20,BECKETT>Yeah, we checked into that. You got there at 11:00.

960
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,460
<37-20,BECKETT>莎娜十点半就遇害了
<37-20,BECKETT>Shana was dead by 10:30.

961
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:18,380
<37-21,ELLIOTT>我发誓
<37-21,ELLIOTT>I swear to you.

962
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:20,470
<37-21,ELLIOTT>-我是被陷害的  -抱歉
<37-21,ELLIOTT>- I am being set up. - I'm sorry.

963
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:22,830
<37-22,GATES>恐怕我们别无选择  只得逮捕你
<37-22,GATES>I'm afraid I have no other choice but to arrest you for --

964
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,900
<37-23,CASTLE>等一下
<37-23,CASTLE>Wait!

965
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,650
<37-24,CASTLE>他说的是实话
<37-24,CASTLE>He's telling the truth.

966
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,670
<37-24,CASTLE>斯伯丁·埃利奥特不是凶手
<37-24,CASTLE>Spalding Elliot is not our killer.

967
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:36,400
<38-1,GATES>我叫你别碰这个案子
<38-1,GATES>Was I not clear when I told you

968
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,360
<38-1,GATES>我说得还不够清楚吗
<38-1,GATES>to stay away from this case?!

969
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,510
<38-2,CASTLE>好吧  我知道你不开心
<38-2,CASTLE>Okay, I can see you're upset,

970
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:42,020
<38-2,CASTLE>但是我保证  你马上就会明白
<38-2,CASTLE>but I promise -- in a moment, you'll understand.

971
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:42,990
<38-4,CASTLE>杰瑞米
<38-4,CASTLE>Jeremy?

972
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,670
<38-2,CASTLE>这位是杰瑞米
<38-2,CASTLE>This is Jeremy.

973
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:46,400
<38-2,CASTLE>他是死者的朋友兼狗保姆
<38-2,CASTLE>He's the victim's friend and dog sitter.

974
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,850
<38-3,GATES>怎么  杰瑞米是证人吗
<38-3,GATES>Oh, so, Jeremy is some sort of a witness?

975
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:49,770
<38-4,CASTLE>不是
<38-4,CASTLE>Uh, not quite.

976
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:50,750
<38-4,CASTLE>杰瑞米  给我
<38-4,CASTLE>Jeremy, if I may...

977
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:54,050
<38-5,GATES>小狗  小狗是证人
<38-5,GATES>Oh, the dog? The dog is the witness?

978
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:54,990
<38-5,GATES>卡塞尔先生
<38-5,GATES>Mr. Castle --

979
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:56,480
<38-6,CASTLE>瞧好吧
<38-6,CASTLE>Just watch.

980
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:00,550
<39-1,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你干什么
<39-1,BECKETT>Castle, what are you doing?

981
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:02,010
<39-2,CASTLE>证明他的清白
<39-2,CASTLE>Proving this man's innocence.

982
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:02,950
<39-3,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<39-3,BECKETT>Castle...

983
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,420
<39-4,CASTLE>埃利奥特先生  抱歉了
<39-4,CASTLE>Mr. Elliot, if I may...

984
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,690
<39-5,ELLIOTT>求你  别
<39-5,ELLIOTT>Please. No!

985
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:07,680
<39-6,CASTLE>我记得在看埃利奥特先生的档案时
<39-6,CASTLE>See, I remember reading in a profile of Mr. Elliot

986
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:10,200
<39-6,CASTLE>他对长毛犬有极度过敏反应
<39-6,CASTLE>that he has a severe allergy to long-haired dogs.

987
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:14,190
<39-7,BECKETT>被害人的公寓到处都是狗毛
<39-7,BECKETT>And the victim's apartment was covered in dog hair.

988
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,070
<39-7,BECKETT>对头
<39-7,BECKETT>Exactly.

989
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:16,780
<39-8,CASTLE>这种人根本就不能
<39-8,CASTLE>Now, does this seem like the kind of man

990
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,360
<39-8,CASTLE>待在莎娜住处
<39-8,CASTLE>who could wait in Shana's apartment,

991
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,300
<39-8,CASTLE>更别说在等的时候抽烟了
<39-8,CASTLE>let alone smoke a cigarette while he did so?

992
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,410
<39-9,ELLIOTT>求你了
<39-9,ELLIOTT>Please!

993
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:24,470
<39-10,BECKETT>倒也是  不过他可能是装的
<39-10,BECKETT>No, but, I mean, he could be faking the whole thing.

994
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:27,080
<39-11,ELLIOTT>求你了  再这样  就出疹子了
<39-11,ELLIOTT>Please! Please! Get him out of here before the hives start!

995
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:30,400
<39-12,CASTLE>不是装的
<39-12,CASTLE>I think that ship has sailed.

996
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:35,400
<39-13,BECKETT>疹子的确装不出来
<39-13,BECKETT>Okay. Yeah. Definitely not faking that.

997
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:38,100
<40-1,RYAN>这是斯伯丁·埃利奥特在莎娜被害当晚
<40-1,RYAN>Here is Spalding Elliot arriving at the fundraiser

998
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,840
<40-1,RYAN>抵达慈善晚宴的照片
<40-1,RYAN>the night of Shana's death.

999
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:43,450
<40-1,RYAN>看吧  他脸上没有红色的疹子
<40-1,RYAN>Note the lack of red splotches on his face.

1000
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:44,600
<40-2,BECKETT>他如果直接从莎娜住处
<40-2,BECKETT>There's no way that he came

1001
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,550
<40-2,BECKETT>去那里  看起来肯定不是这个样子
<40-2,BECKETT>straight from her apartment looking like that.

1002
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,640
<40-3,ESPOSITO>也就是说莱恩之前猜对了
<40-3,ESPOSITO>Which means Ryan nailed it before.

1003
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,920
<40-3,ESPOSITO>这的确是个阴谋
<40-3,ESPOSITO>This is a conspiracy.

1004
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:52,690
<40-4,CASTLE>莱恩  你往阴谋那个方向思考了
<40-4,CASTLE>Ryan, you played the "C" card?

1005
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:55,140
<40-5,RYAN>你不在
<40-5,RYAN>Well, I mean, um, you weren't around.

1006
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,340
<40-5,RYAN>总得有人接班
<40-5,RYAN>Somebody had to step up.

1007
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:58,480
<40-6,BECKETT>这阴谋如果想成功
<40-6,BECKETT>Okay, for this setup to work,

1008
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,510
<40-6,BECKETT>得有人让莎娜行动起来  告诉她掩盖真相的事
<40-6,BECKETT>someone had to activate Shana and tell her about the cover up.

1009
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,770
<40-7,CASTLE>那样的话  她的死会将调查方向引到
<40-7,CASTLE>Right. That way, her death would create an investigative path

1010
00:38:03,770 --> 00:38:04,930
<40-7,CASTLE>埃利奥特身上
<40-7,CASTLE>that led straight to Elliot.

1011
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:06,120
<40-8,ESPOSITO>把她的死栽赃在他身上
<40-8,ESPOSITO>Setting him up for her murder.

1012
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,330
<40-9,CASTLE>我认为我们要找的人
<40-9,CASTLE>My guess is we're dealing with

1013
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:09,520
<40-9,CASTLE>是个天价掮客
<40-9,CASTLE>some kind of big-money fixer,

1014
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,510
<40-9,CASTLE>藏在暗处的职业杀手  迈克尔·克莱顿那种
<40-9,CASTLE>a shadow-y gun-for-hire, Michael Clayton type.

1016
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:16,260
<40-10,BECKETT>不管是谁在犯罪现场放置了埃利奥特的DNA
<40-10,BECKETT>Well, whoever planted Elliot's DNA at the crime scene

1017
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,530
<40-10,BECKETT>总得有办法拿到烟头
<40-10,BECKETT>had to have gotten the cigarette butt from somewhere.

1018
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:20,970
<40-11,CASTLE>也就是说那人在某个时候跟埃利奥特有交集
<40-11,CASTLE>Which means they had to intersect with Elliot at some point.

1019
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:23,320
<40-11,CASTLE>如果我们找到了时间和地点
<40-11,CASTLE>If we can figure out where and when --

1020
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,960
<40-12,GATES>"我们"  卡塞尔先生
<40-12,GATES>"We," Mr. Castle?

1021
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:27,590
<40-12,GATES>不是吧
<40-12,GATES>Really?

1022
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:29,390
<40-13,CASTLE>可我
<40-13,CASTLE>But I --

1023
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,480
<40-13,CASTLE>我都给你们送大礼了啊
<40-13,CASTLE>I brought him -- on a silver pla--

1024
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:33,710
<40-14,CASTLE>好吧
<40-14,CASTLE>Fine.

1025
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:36,610
<40-14,CASTLE>我自行撤退
<40-14,CASTLE>I'll show myself out.

1026
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:44,190
<41-1,CASTLE>我们追寻的是同一件事  正义
<41-1,CASTLE>We were all after the same thing -- justice.

1027
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,630
<41-1,CASTLE>麻烦的是  在我这
<41-1,CASTLE>Trouble is, when it came to me,

1028
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:48,070
<41-1,CASTLE>正义女神有别的打算
<41-1,CASTLE>Lady Justice had different plans.

1029
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,080
<41-1,CASTLE>当贝克特和伙计们接近凶手的时候
<41-1,CASTLE>While Beckett and the boys closed in on the killer,

1030
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,880
<41-1,CASTLE>我已如昨日垃圾倒进阴沟
<41-1,CASTLE>I had been to the gutter like yesterday's trash.

1031
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:55,820
<41-1,CASTLE>不太公平啊
<41-1,CASTLE>It just didn't seem fair.

1032
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,320
<41-1,CASTLE>说得对
<41-1,CASTLE>You're right.

1033
00:38:58,930 --> 00:38:59,890
<41-2,BECKETT>是不太公平
<41-2,BECKETT>It's not fair.

1034
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:00,710
<41-3,CASTLE>贝克特
<41-3,CASTLE>Hey! Beckett.

1035
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:03,150
<41-3,CASTLE>我在听一些录制的笔记
<41-3,CASTLE>I was just, uh, listening to some notes I made

1036
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:04,700
<41-3,CASTLE>查案时录的  你来做什么
<41-3,CASTLE>for the ca-- I just -- what are you doing here?

1037
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,810
<41-4,BECKETT>我们用检查了那个烟头
<41-4,BECKETT>You know, we took another look at the cigarette butt --

1038
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:08,740
<41-4,BECKETT>有埃利奥特DNA的那个
<41-4,BECKETT>The one with Elliot's Dna.

1039
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:12,350
<41-4,BECKETT>在上面发现了烧烤汁的残留
<41-4,BECKETT>It turns out it had traces of barbecue sauce on it.

1040
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:14,940
<41-5,CASTLE>我记得你说不能跟我分享查案情况
<41-5,CASTLE>I thought you said you couldn't share.

1041
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:16,070
<41-5,CASTLE>是不能
<41-5,CASTLE>I can't.

1042
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:17,760
<41-6,BECKETT>但如果不是你分享了
<41-6,BECKETT>But if you hadn't shared,

1043
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,250
<41-6,BECKETT>我们还会把埃利奥特当成凶手
<41-6,BECKETT>Then we'd still be looking at Elliot as our killer.

1044
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:22,560
<41-6,BECKETT>再说这里只有我们俩
<41-6,BECKETT>And besides, we got the place to ourselves,

1045
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,720
<41-6,BECKETT>谁会知道呢
<41-6,BECKETT>So who's gonna know?

1046
00:39:25,010 --> 00:39:28,710
<41-7,CASTLE>我想埃利奥特最近吃烤肉了
<41-7,CASTLE>So, I assume Elliot has had barbecue recently.

1047
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:31,580
<41-8,BECKETT>上周  在上城区一家烤排餐馆
<41-8,BECKETT>Just last week at a rib joint uptown.

1048
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,930
<41-8,BECKETT>我们看了监控录像
<41-8,BECKETT>We scrubbed the security video,

1049
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:35,740
<41-8,BECKETT>你绝对猜不到是谁
<41-8,BECKETT>and you'll never guess who we found

1050
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:39,820
<41-8,BECKETT>在烟灰缸里找埃利奥特的烟头
<41-8,BECKETT>digging through the ash can for one of Elliot's cigarette butts.

1051
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,630
<41-9,CASTLE>不会吧  那就是我们的迈克尔·克莱顿
<41-9,CASTLE>No way. That's our Michael Clayton?

1052
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:43,570
<41-10,BECKETT>被幕后黑手雇佣
<41-10,BECKETT>Likely hired by whoever is behind all of this

1053
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:45,430
<41-10,BECKETT>成为莎娜的朋友  透露消息给她
<41-10,BECKETT>to befriend Shana, whisper in her ear,

1054
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:47,000
<41-10,BECKETT>要她去调查
<41-10,BECKETT>and urge her to investigate.

1055
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,870
<41-11,CASTLE>并确认我们追查指向拉德诺大学的线索
<41-11,CASTLE>And who ensured - we followed the trail to Radnor.

1056
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:52,490
<41-11,CASTLE>真希望能在你们给这人戴手铐时
<41-11,CASTLE>Oh, I wish I could see the look on their face

1057
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:53,640
<41-11,CASTLE>看看这人脸上的表情
<41-11,CASTLE>when you slap the cuffs on them.

1058
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,630
<41-12,BECKETT>也许你可以看到
<41-12,BECKETT>Yeah, well, maybe you can.

1059
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:58,760
<41-12,BECKETT>卡塞尔先生
<41-12,BECKETT>Mr. Castle.

1060
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:01,290
<41-13,NICOLE>我接到紧急电话  让我来  说与莎娜·贝克有关
<41-13,NICOLE>I got an urgent call to meet you here regarding Shana Baker?

1061
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:05,460
<41-13,NICOLE>是的
<41-13,NICOLE>Yes.

1062
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:08,170
<41-14,CASTLE>有最后一个问题  莫里斯女士
<41-14,CASTLE>Yes. Just one final question, Ms. Morris.

1063
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:10,860
<41-14,CASTLE>谁雇你杀了莎娜·贝克
<41-14,CASTLE>Who hired you to kill Shana Baker

1064
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:12,340
<41-14,CASTLE>然后陷害斯伯丁·埃利奥特
<41-14,CASTLE>and frame Spalding Elliot?

1065
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,750
<41-15,NICOLE>你在说什么
<41-15,NICOLE>Wh-what are you talking about?

1066
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:17,670
<41-16,CASTLE>你知道的
<41-16,CASTLE>I think you know.

1067
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,240
<41-16,CASTLE>那是你  收集埃利奥特的烟头
<41-16,CASTLE>That's you retrieving Elliot's cigarette butt

1068
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,650
<41-16,CASTLE>以便你能把其放在犯罪现场
<41-16,CASTLE>so you could plant it at the crime scene

1069
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:25,580
<41-16,CASTLE>在你杀了莎娜之后
<41-16,CASTLE>after you killed Shana.

1070
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:29,860
<41-16,CASTLE>妮可·莫里斯
<41-16,CASTLE>Nicole Morris,

1071
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:33,300
<41-17,BECKETT>你因谋杀莎娜·贝克而被捕
<41-17,BECKETT>you're under arrest for the murder of Shana Baker.

1072
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:34,750
<41-18,CASTLE>我一直听说哈里森-里德律所
<41-18,CASTLE>You know, I always heard Harrison and Reid

1073
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:36,120
<41-18,CASTLE>是家超赞[杀手]的律所
<41-18,CASTLE>were a killer law firm.

1074
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:37,910
<41-18,CASTLE>终于知道原因了
<41-18,CASTLE>Now I know why.

1075
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,630
<41-19,CASTLE>结案
<41-19,CASTLE>Case closed.

1076
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:50,960
<42-1,CASTLE>你认为我们会知晓妮可·莫里斯为谁卖命吗
<42-1,CASTLE>You think we'll ever know who Nicole Morris works for?

1077
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,170
<42-2,BECKETT>她不会说的
<42-2,BECKETT>Ah, she's not gonna tell us.

1078
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:54,280
<42-2,BECKETT>但我们发现了几笔巨额汇款
<42-2,BECKETT>But we did find several large payments

1079
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,450
<42-2,BECKETT>转至她的账户
<42-2,BECKETT>wired to her account,

1080
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:58,070
<42-2,BECKETT>埃利奥特势要找到源头
<42-2,BECKETT>and Elliot is determined to find their source.

1081
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,840
<42-3,CASTLE>是我的话  也会劲头十足
<42-3,CASTLE>Well, I would be determined, too.

1082
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:01,560
<42-3,CASTLE>如果不是因为小狗闪闪
<42-3,CASTLE>That guy would be spending time in jail

1083
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,390
<42-3,CASTLE>他要在监狱待很长时间呢
<42-3,CASTLE>if it wasn't for a dog named sparkles.

1084
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:05,220
<42-4,BECKETT>还多亏了私家侦探卡塞尔
<42-4,BECKETT>And a P.I. named Castle.

1085
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:07,120
<42-4,BECKETT>真为你骄傲
<42-4,BECKETT>I'm proud of you.

1086
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:09,690
<42-4,BECKETT>我本以为你是闹着玩的
<42-4,BECKETT>I just -- I thought this was another one of your larks,

1087
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:13,160
<42-4,BECKETT>为了消磨时间  但你让我刮目相看
<42-4,BECKETT>a way to kill time, but...you impressed me.

1088
00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:14,750
<42-5,CASTLE>我都有点为自己刮目相看了
<42-5,CASTLE>You know, I kind of impressed myself.

1089
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,710
<42-5,CASTLE>为新书找到了各种点子
<42-5,CASTLE>I got all sorts of ideas for my new book.

1090
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:21,050
<42-5,CASTLE>只有一件事没能如愿
<42-5,CASTLE>Just one thing didn't work out as planned.

1091
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,870
<42-6,BECKETT>你知道如果依着我
<42-6,BECKETT>You know that if this was up to me

1092
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,630
<42-6,BECKETT>我们会并肩工作的
<42-6,BECKETT>that we would be working together, right?

1093
00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:27,840
<42-7,CASTLE>知道  但不能依着你  我们也无法共事
<42-7,CASTLE>Yes, but since it's not and we can't,

1094
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:30,140
<42-7,CASTLE>我在想  如果我把私家侦探这差事
<42-7,CASTLE>I was wondering how you'd feel if I...

1095
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,450
<42-7,CASTLE>继续一段时间  你怎么想
<42-7,CASTLE>kept with this for a while.

1096
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:36,020
<42-8,BECKETT>别动
<42-8,BECKETT>Don't move.

1097
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:44,440
<42-9,CASTLE>这是什么
<42-9,CASTLE>What's this?

1098
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:46,110
<42-10,BECKETT>我的答案
<42-10,BECKETT>It's my answer.

1099
00:41:54,730 --> 00:41:57,570
<42-11,CASTLE>我明天要戴着这个去上班
<42-11,CASTLE>I'm so gonna wear this to work tomorrow!

1100
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,280
<42-12,BECKETT>接着看  还有呢
<42-12,BECKETT>Keep going. There's something else.

1101
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:06,990
<42-13,BECKETT>也许你可以用它寻找下一个客户
<42-13,BECKETT>So, maybe you can use that to locate an actual client.

1102
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:09,530
<42-14,CASTLE>我找到了更想看的东西
<42-14,CASTLE>I think I see something I like better already.

1103
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:14,020
<42-14,CASTLE>你想进卧室一起分享吗
<42-14,CASTLE>You care to go into the other room and...Share?

1104
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:15,200
<42-15,BECKETT>有一个条件
<42-15,BECKETT>On one condition.

1105
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:17,100
<42-17,BECKETT>-什么  -帽子要一直戴着
<42-17,BECKETT>- What? - The hat stays on.
