11
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:01,270
<1-1,DAVE JOHNSON>玛莎  没什么事吧

<2-2,KATE BECKETT>Last time we were together, you and Richard were,

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,330
<2-3,MARTHA>缠缠绵绵呢
<2-3,MARTHA>Uh, "Ha ha," you know?

17
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:09,420
<2-3,MARTHA>而只过了几周
<2-3,MARTHA>And now, just a few short weeks later,

18
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,100
<2-3,MARTHA>你和理查德就...
<2-3,MARTHA>you and Richard are, uh "Pfft," you know?

20
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,110
<2-4,BECKETT>很复杂
<2-4,BECKETT>It's complicated.

21
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,460
<2-5,MARTHA>他上两次离婚也都如此
<2-5,MARTHA>So were his last two divorces.

22
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,080
<2-6,BECKETT>天呐  玛莎  我们不会离婚的
<2-6,BECKETT>Oh, god. Martha, we're not getting a divorce.

23
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,830
<2-7,MARTHA>算我老派
<2-7,MARTHA>Well, call me old-fashioned,

24
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:23,230
<2-7,MARTHA>但已婚夫妇不是都住一起的吗
<2-7,MARTHA>but don't married couples live together?

25
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,710
<2-8,BECKETT>是啊  但情况复杂
<2-8,BECKETT>Yes, but I-it's complicated,

26
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,590
<2-8,BECKETT>我有些事要处理
<2-8,BECKETT>and... and I'm working through a few things.

27
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:28,790
<2-8,BECKETT>理查德告诉我了
<2-8,BECKETT>Richard told me that...

28
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:31,660
<2-9,MARTHA>然后就宣布说要把你赢回来
<2-9,MARTHA>Right before he declared he was going to win you back.

29
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:36,370
<2-9,MARTHA>你也知道  我儿子有很多特点
<2-9,MARTHA>Look, as you know, my son is a lot of things...

30
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:39,600
<2-9,MARTHA>有优点  有缺点
<2-9,MARTHA>Some of them good, some of them not so good.

31
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:46,010
<2-9,MARTHA>但你总能指望他
<2-9,MARTHA>But he is someone you can always count on.

32
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:48,670
<2-9,MARTHA>这可不常有  丫头
<2-9,MARTHA>And that is a rare thing, kiddo.

34
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,730
<2-10,BECKETT>嗯
<2-10,BECKETT>Uh, yeah.

35
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,200
<2-10,BECKETT>好的  我让警探马上出警
<2-10,BECKETT>All right. I'll have detectives respond.

36
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:01,760
<2-10,BECKETT>玛莎  对不起  有案子
<2-10,BECKETT>Uh, Martha, I'm sorry. Uh, there's a murder, and...

37
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,470
<2-11,MARTHA>凯瑟琳  亲爱的
<2-11,MARTHA>Katherine, darling...

38
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:11,310
<2-12,MARTHA>坦诚对自己
<2-12,MARTHA>Look, be honest with yourself

39
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:14,260
<2-12,MARTHA>也坦诚对你丈夫
<2-12,MARTHA>and be honest with your husband.

40
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:23,870
<3-1,KEVIN RYAN>我以为第二胎能少花钱呢
<3-1,KEVIN RYAN>Man, I thought the second kid would be cheaper.

41
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,820
<3-1,KEVIN RYAN>但珍妮什么都想买新的
<3-1,KEVIN RYAN>But Jenny... she wants all new stuff.

42
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,830
<3-1,KEVIN RYAN>你真该看看她选的婴儿车
<3-1,KEVIN RYAN>You should see the baby stroller that she picked out.

43
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,570
<3-1,KEVIN RYAN>真的  我可能得再找份全职工作了
<3-1,KEVIN RYAN>Seriously, I might have to get a second full-time job.

44
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,510
<3-2,JAVIER ESPOSITO>或者你在第一份工作上多挣点
<3-2,JAVIER ESPOSITO>Or you can make more money from your first job.

45
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:35,490
<3-3,RYAN>怎么  加班吗
<3-3,RYAN>What, like overtime?

46
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:36,480
<3-4,ESPOSITO>不  升职
<3-4,ESPOSITO>No... promotion.

47
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,630
<3-4,ESPOSITO>警长考试一周后举行  我们去考吧
<3-4,ESPOSITO>Sergeant's exam is in a week. Let's take it.

<3-5,RYAN>一周  我们哪来的时间学习啊
<3-5,RYAN>A week?! When are we gonna have time to study?

49
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,240
<3-6,ESPOSITO>能多难
<3-6,ESPOSITO>How hard can it be?

50
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,700
<3-6,ESPOSITO>威尔基警长就通过了
<3-6,ESPOSITO>Sergeant Wilkie passed,

51
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,690
<3-6,ESPOSITO>他简直差一条染色体就是尼安德特人了
<3-6,ESPOSITO>and he's, like, a chromosome away from a Neanderthal.

52
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:47,010
<3-7,RYAN>或许你是对的
<3-7,RYAN>Maybe you're right.

53
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,000
<3-7,RYAN>好吧  我打去总部  给咱俩报名
<3-7,RYAN>Okay, I'll call 1pp, sign us both up.

<4-2,LANIE>What? Did you guys rehearse that?

59
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,650
<4-3,ESPOSITO>都做过祭坛助手
<4-3,ESPOSITO>Former altar boys.

60
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:15,410
<4-4,RYAN>嗯  大概是下意识反应什么的
<4-4,RYAN>Yeah. Probably an involuntary reflex or something.

61
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,670
<4-5,LANIE>从伤口看
<4-5,LANIE>Wound suggests he was shot

62
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,420
<4-5,LANIE>他是昨晚8到11点间中的枪
<4-5,LANIE>8:00 and 11:00 p.m. last night.

63
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:22,370
<4-6,RYAN>那么晚教堂还对外开放吗
<4-6,RYAN>Kind of late for a church to be open to the public, isn't it?

64
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:24,520
<4-7,LANIE>没开放  教区人说
<4-7,LANIE>It wasn't... the sisters of the Parish said

65
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:26,320
<4-7,LANIE>教堂6点就已锁门了
<4-7,LANIE>the place was locked at 6:00,

00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:29,260
<4-7,LANIE>前门被人撬开了
<4-7,LANIE>that the front door had been jimmied.

68
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:32,040
<4-8,RYAN>怎么  大卫是和凶手一起闯进来的吗
<4-8,RYAN>So, what... Dave and the killer broke in together?

69
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:33,700
<4-9,LANIE>不太像  证据显示
<4-9,LANIE>Doubt it... evidence shows

70
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,100
<4-9,LANIE>凶手是偷偷溜进来  躲在一扇祈祷用的
<4-9,LANIE>that the killer snuck in and shot Dave from behind

71
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:39,030
<4-9,LANIE>装饰性彩窗后面  枪击了大卫  击碎了玻璃
<4-9,LANIE>what was a decorative stained-glass window for prayer.

00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:42,930
<4-10,LANIE>不是吧
<4-10,LANIE>Really?!

<5-3,RYAN>您是否知道
<5-3,RYAN>Do you have any idea

77

<5-4,ARGUELLO>Not a clue.

79
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,320
<5-4,ARGUELLO>或许他妻子知道
<5-4,ARGUELLO>Perhaps his wife knows.

80
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,980
<5-4,ARGUELLO>你们跟温迪谈过了吗
<5-4,ARGUELLO>Have you spoken to Wendy?

86
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,690
<5-6,ARGUELLO>可以说是最伟大的

<5-7,ESPOSITO>Greatest what?

88
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,380
<5-8,ARGUELLO>这反正也要曝出来
<5-8,ARGUELLO>Well, it's going to come out sooner or later.

89
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,460
<5-8,ARGUELLO>大卫是近50年来
<5-8,ARGUELLO>Dave was one of the greatest novelists

<5-8,ARGUELLO>大卫·约翰逊

93
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:34,900
<5-10,ARGUELLO>那是因为他用了假名
<5-10,ARGUELLO>That's because he wrote under a pseudonym.

94
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,270
<6-1,ALEXIS CASTLE>爸爸  你听说了吗
<6-1,ALEXIS CASTLE>Dad? Did you hear?

<7-2,ALEXIS>Remember, I wrote that paper about him in eighth grade.

104
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,030
<7-3,CASTLE>每位作家都梦想写下伟大的美国小说
<7-3,CASTLE>Every author dreams of writing the great American novel,

105
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,540
<7-3,CASTLE>但P·J·莫菲特真做到了
<7-3,CASTLE>but P.J. Moffet actually did it.

106
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,850
<7-3,CASTLE>而且是一举成名  《伯劳鸟之歌》
<7-3,CASTLE>On his first try, too... "The butcherbird's song."

107
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,940
<7-4,ALEXIS>25年来  他再未写过东西
<7-4,ALEXIS>And in 25 years, he never wrote another word.

108
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,510
<7-4,ALEXIS>一本书  就从公众视野中消失了
<7-4,ALEXIS>Just one book, then he disappeared from public life.

109
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:18,390
<7-4,ALEXIS>据推特上的消息
<7-4,ALEXIS>According to twitter,

<7-7,CASTLE>是他被杀地点太好了

<7-7,CASTLE>圣马克教堂
<7-7,CASTLE>St. Mark's...

116
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,750
<7-7,CASTLE>那是12分局的辖区
<7-7,CASTLE>That's in the jurisdiction of the 12th precinct,

117
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,230
<7-7,CASTLE>而我可是个P·J·莫菲特的专家
<7-7,CASTLE>and I am an expert on all things P.J. Moffet.

118
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,680
<7-8,ALEXIS>看来你还是要继续这个"跟贝克特一起破案
<7-8,ALEXIS>So you're still going with the "Win Beckett back

00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,410
<7-8,ALEXIS>进而赢回她"的计划
<7-8,ALEXIS>by working homicides with her" Plan?

120
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:36,270
<7-9,CASTLE>她一开始就是这么爱上我的
<7-9,CASTLE>That's how I got her to fall for me the first time --

121
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:39,450
<7-9,CASTLE>一起办案  还有...我吻她的时候  我用...
<7-9,CASTLE>That and...when I kiss her, I use the bottom --

<7-10,ALEXIS>爸  你提到性生活的时候
<7-10,ALEXIS>Dad, when it comes to your sex life, how about

123
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,250
<7-10,ALEXIS>咱们能不能还是走剪辑版的路线
<7-10,ALEXIS>we stick with the "Afterschool special" version?

124
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:45,570
<7-11,CASTLE>可以接受
<7-11,CASTLE>That's fair.

125
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:49,100
<7-12,ALEXIS>很好  那你这次打算怎么介入这案子
<7-12,ALEXIS>Okay, so, what's going to be your way into the case this time?

126
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:51,360
<7-13,CASTLE>我只需要...
<7-13,CASTLE>Well, all I need is, uh...

127
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:52,720
<7-13,CASTLE>一个客户
<7-13,CASTLE>A client.

128
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,060
<8-1,BECKETT>喂  蕾妮打电话来了
<8-1,BECKETT>You guys, Lanie called.

129
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,460
<8-1,BECKETT>现场没发现有用的指纹
<8-1,BECKETT>No usable prints from the crime scene,

130
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,880
<8-1,BECKETT>也没留下弹道痕迹
<8-1,BECKETT>And no hits off ballistics.

131
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:01,480
<8-2,ESPOSITO>《伯劳鸟之歌》还是算很火的小说吧
<8-2,ESPOSITO>"The butcherbird song" Is still a popular novel, right?

132
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,950
<8-2,ESPOSITO>虽然已经25年了
<8-2,ESPOSITO>I mean, it's 25 years old,

133
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:05,110
<8-2,ESPOSITO>但被害人应该依然有大笔版税入账
<8-2,ESPOSITO>but our victim should still be getting huge royalty checks.

134
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:07,630
<8-3,RYAN>对  大部分高中都把它列入必读书单了
<8-3,RYAN>Yeah. It's required reading in most high schools.

135
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:09,650
<8-4,ESPOSITO>那为什么过去五年来  他会住在单身公寓里
<8-4,ESPOSITO>Then why was he living in a one-bedroom apartment

136
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:11,860
<8-4,ESPOSITO>还做着门卫的工作呢
<8-4,ESPOSITO>and working as a janitor for the past five years?

137
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,210
<8-5,BECKETT>我给出版商打电话问问  让他们确认下他的身份
<8-5,BECKETT>I'll call the publisher, have them confirm who he is.

138
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:15,220
<8-6,CASTLE>不用了
<8-6,CASTLE>No need.

139
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:17,810
<8-6,CASTLE>我们能帮忙
<8-6,CASTLE>We can do that for you.

140
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:22,360
<8-7,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你怎么来了
<8-7,BECKETT>Uh...Castle, what are you doing here?

141
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,460
<8-8,CASTLE>来见见我的客户
<8-8,CASTLE>Meet my client.

142
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,080
<8-8,CASTLE>这是温迪·约翰逊  大卫·约翰逊的妻子
<8-8,CASTLE>This is Wendy Johnson, wife of Dave Johnson,

143
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,400
<8-8,CASTLE>后者就是著名的小说家P·J·莫菲特
<8-8,CASTLE>also known as famed novelist P.J. Moffet.

144
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,850
<8-8,CASTLE>我们是来录口供的
<8-8,CASTLE>We're here to make a statement.

145
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:33,340
<8-9,ESPOSITO>我们带她去贝克特警监的办公室
<8-9,ESPOSITO>Well, we'll...escort her to Captain Beckett's office.

146
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:39,600
<8-10,BECKETT>你的客户  卡塞尔
<8-10,BECKETT>Your client, Castle?

147
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:42,420
<8-10,BECKETT>别告诉我是你去死缠烂打的
<8-10,BECKETT>Please don't tell me you ambulance-chased this woman.

148
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:44,870
<8-11,CASTLE>贝克特  这么说可太过分了
<8-11,CASTLE>Beckett, that is an outrageous accusation.

149
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:47,320
<8-11,CASTLE>我  作为作家协会的一员
<8-11,CASTLE>I, as a member of the writing community,

150
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,080
<8-11,CASTLE>只是去她家表示了一下关心
<8-11,CASTLE>merely went by her home to offer my condolences.

151
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,640
<8-12,BECKETT>我猜你还告诉她你是私家侦探了吧
<8-12,BECKETT>And I suppose you told her that you're a P.I.

152
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,550
<8-12,BECKETT>而且正好跟纽约警局还有点关系
<8-12,BECKETT>who just happens to have connections with the NYPD.

153
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:56,620
<8-13,CASTLE>可能不小心提到了这些
<8-13,CASTLE>The topic may have come up.

154
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,260
<8-13,CASTLE>啊对了  你真美啊
<8-13,CASTLE>You look gorgeous, by the way.

155
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,430
<8-14,BECKETT>我们该去跟你的客户谈谈了
<8-14,BECKETT>Uh, we should go and talk to your client.

156
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:08,410
<9-1,WENDY JOHNSON>我们才刚结婚八个月
<9-1,WENDY JOHNSON>We'd only been married for eight months.

157
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:12,610
<9-1,WENDY JOHNSON>可我觉得好像认识他一辈子了
<9-1,WENDY JOHNSON>I felt like I'd known him my entire life.

158
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:19,120
<9-1,WENDY JOHNSON>也许因为那本书伴随了我的成长吧
<9-1,WENDY JOHNSON>Probably because I grew up just loving that book.

159
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,730
<9-2,BECKETT>说到这个  约翰逊太太
<9-2,BECKETT>Uh, yeah, about that, Mrs. Johnson --

160
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:24,160
<9-2,BECKETT>您丈夫已经如此成功了
<9-2,BECKETT>Considering your husband's success,

161
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,030
<9-2,BECKETT>为什么还要去当门卫呢
<9-2,BECKETT>why was he working as a janitor?

162
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:27,760
<9-3,WENDY>他是为了新书在做调查
<9-3,WENDY>Well, that was research for a new book.

163
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,120
<9-4,CASTLE>第二本P·J·莫菲特的小说吗
<9-4,CASTLE>A second P.J. Moffet novel?

164
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,100
<9-5,BECKETT>他调查了五年
<9-5,BECKETT>He was doing research for over five years?

165
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,580
<9-6,CASTLE>莫菲特为了写书
<9-6,CASTLE>Moffet was legendary

166
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,040
<9-6,CASTLE>能投入得走火入魔  这很有名
<9-6,CASTLE>for total immersion in his subject matter --

167
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:40,720
<9-6,CASTLE>就像我对你一样
<9-6,CASTLE>Much like me with you.

168
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:44,450
<9-6,CASTLE>你知道吗  在《伯劳鸟之歌》动笔前
<9-6,CASTLE>Uh, did you know that before writing a single word

169
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:46,890
<9-6,CASTLE>莫菲特曾花了七年时间
<9-6,CASTLE>of "The butcherbird song," Moffet spent seven years

170
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:48,620
<9-6,CASTLE>过着爱斯基摩瘾君子般的生活
<9-6,CASTLE>living as a drug-addicted eskimo?

171
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,620
<9-6,CASTLE>是真的
<9-6,CASTLE>It's true.

172
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,160
<9-7,WENDY>他对自己的作品无比专注
<9-7,WENDY>He was extremely dedicated to his craft.

173
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,260
<9-7,WENDY>他在怀俄明州有一大片农场
<9-7,WENDY>Even though he owns a ranch in Wyoming,

174
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,080
<9-7,WENDY>可他却坚持婚后要住在布鲁克林  体验真实生活
<9-7,WENDY>He insisted we live in Brooklyn for authenticity.

175
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,360
<9-8,BECKETT>他昨晚为什么要闯入圣马克教堂
<9-8,BECKETT>Why did he break into St. Mark's church last night?

176
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,160
<9-9,WENDY>我只能猜测他是去祈祷的
<9-9,WENDY>I can only guess it was to pray.

177
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:08,290
<9-9,WENDY>他最近非常困扰
<9-9,WENDY>He had been extremely troubled recently.

178
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,130
<9-10,CASTLE>你知道是为什么吗
<9-10,CASTLE>Do you know about what?

179
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,410
<9-11,WENDY>我觉得是跟他的调查有关
<9-11,WENDY>I think it had to be his research.

180
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:13,870
<9-11,WENDY>大卫离开的时候
<9-11,WENDY>When Dave left,

181
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,610
<9-11,WENDY>跟我说他那天早上见了个人
<9-11,WENDY>he told me he met with someone that morning,

182
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:16,970
<9-11,WENDY>局面有点失控
<9-11,WENDY>and things got heated.

183
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:18,400
<9-12,BECKETT>他见了谁
<9-12,BECKETT>And who did he meet with?

184
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:21,120
<9-13,WENDY>他没说  只说那人很危险
<9-13,WENDY>He didn't say -- just that the man was dangerous.

185
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,460
<9-14,CASTLE>他的新书要写什么题材
<9-14,CASTLE>Well, what was his new book about?

186
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,780
<9-15,WENDY>黑手党
<9-15,WENDY>Um, the mafia.

187
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:32,830
<10-1,ESPOSITO>卡塞尔呢
<10-1,ESPOSITO>Where's Castle?

188
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:34,210
<10-2,BECKETT>送他的客户回家了
<10-2,BECKETT>He took his client home.

189
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:37,030
<10-2,BECKETT>记住  他不再是跟我们一起办案了
<10-2,BECKETT>Remember, he doesn't work cases with us anymore.

190
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,030
<10-3,RYAN>我查到被害人昨天上午在哪里了
<10-3,RYAN>So, I found out where our vic was yesterday morning.

191
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,730
<10-3,RYAN>根据他的开支记录来看
<10-3,RYAN>According to his financials,

192
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,160
<10-3,RYAN>他打了辆车去布鲁克林
<10-3,RYAN>he took a cab ride to Brooklyn.

193
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,320
<10-4,ESPOSITO>他在哪下的车
<10-4,ESPOSITO>Where was he dropped off?

196
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:49,740
<10-5,RYAN>据说他是个彻底的黑手党
<10-5,RYAN>Word is he's totally mobbed up.

197
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:52,340
<10-6,BECKETT>要是被害人在为他的新书做调查
<10-6,BECKETT>If our vic was doing research for his book

198
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,300
<10-6,BECKETT>并且问了太多问题
<10-6,BECKETT>And he asked too many questions,

199
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,820
<10-6,BECKETT>米尔顿也许起了疑心
<10-6,BECKETT>Milton here might have gotten suspicious

200
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,680
<10-6,BECKETT>并除掉了他
<10-6,BECKETT>and taken Dave out.

202
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,610
<10-6,BECKETT>好吧

00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,690
<11-1,MILTON CICERO>可我没杀他  我发誓
<11-1,MILTON CICERO>but I didn't kill him -- I swear.

205
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,460
<11-2,ESPOSITO>-那你怎么认识他的  -我不认识
<11-2,ESPOSITO>- So, how do you know him? - I don't.

206
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,800
<11-3,CICERO>他突然就跑来了  开始问我各种问题
<11-3,CICERO>He just came over, started asking me all these questions.

00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,820
<15-13,CASTLE>伙计们  比利不是你们要找的凶手
<15-13,CASTLE>guys, Billy's not your killer.

<15-14,RYAN>你怎么知道的
<15-14,RYAN>Oh, you know this how?

298
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,130
<15-15,CASTLE>比利告诉我的
<15-15,CASTLE>Billy told me.

299
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:31,410
<15-15,CASTLE>是啊
<15-15,CASTLE>Yeah.

300
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:33,530
<15-16,ESPOSITO>那他有没有在胸前画个十字祈祷赶紧死去呢
<15-16,ESPOSITO>Oh, and did he also cross his heart and hope to die?

301
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,620
<15-17,CASTLE>比利  把你跟我说的告诉他们
<15-17,CASTLE>Billy, tell them what you told me.

302
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,270
<15-17,CASTLE>好吧
<15-17,CASTLE>Okay.

303
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,380
<15-18,CASTLE>假设性地说
<15-18,CASTLE>Let's say, hypothetically...

304
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,570
<15-18,CASTLE>假设
<15-18,CASTLE>Hypothetically.

305
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:44,160
<15-18,CASTLE>我来这里杀"双枪"吉米
<15-18,CASTLE>I came to town to whack Jimmy "Two Guns"

306
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:46,350
<15-18,CASTLE>假设
<15-18,CASTLE>and, hypothetically...

307
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:48,500
<15-18,CASTLE>我把他丢进我租来的车的后备箱里
<15-18,CASTLE>I threw him in the trunk of my rental

308
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,610
<15-19,CASTLE>然后带他去了梅多兰泽的沼泽地里
<15-19,CASTLE>and drove him out to the marsh by the Meadowlands.

309
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:51,160
<15-19,CASTLE>你们知道那个地方
<15-19,CASTLE>You know where that is.

310
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,930
<15-19,CASTLE>只是
<15-19,CASTLE>Only, just before --

311
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:53,700
<15-20,CASTLE>当然还是假设
<15-20,CASTLE>hypothetically... of course.

312
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,660
<15-20,CASTLE>在我冲他开枪之前  我意识到
<15-20,CASTLE>I could put a bullet through his brain, I realized

313
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:59,090
<15-21,CASTLE>这人一点也不像"双枪"吉米
<15-21,CASTLE>the guy doesn't look anything like Jimmy "Two guns."

314
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:02,700
<15-21,CASTLE>好吧  大卫解释了这都是误会
<15-21,CASTLE>Right? So Dave explains it's all just a misunderstanding,

315
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,030
<15-12,CASTLE>-他其实是P·J·莫菲特...  -是的
<15-12,CASTLE>- that he's actually P.J. Moffet... - Yeah.

316
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:07,750
<15-22,CASTLE>他跟别人说他是"双枪"吉米
<15-22,CASTLE>and he's telling everybody he's Jimmy "Two Guns"

317
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,350
<15-22,CASTLE>是为了能为自己的小说做调查
<15-22,CASTLE>so he can do research for his new novel.

318
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:10,900
<15-22,CASTLE>是的  我非常喜欢他的小说
<15-22,CASTLE>Yeah, and I'm a huge fan.

319
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,590
<15-23,CASTLE>《伯劳鸟之歌》  我太喜欢了
<15-23,CASTLE>"The Butcherbird Song" -- it's my everything.

320
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:14,360
<15-23,CASTLE>简直太...我自己也有一本
<15-23,CASTLE>Oh, please. That's -- I have a copy myself.

321
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,770
<20-19,RYAN>别开枪
<20-19,RYAN>No, no!

322
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,480
<15-24,RYAN>比利把大卫带回这里
<15-24,RYAN>So Billy brings Dave back here,

323
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,120
<15-25,CASTLE>然后他付钱帮他洗了夹克
<15-25,CASTLE>and he pays to have his jacket cleaned.

324
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,620
<15-26,CASTLE>是的  他还在书上给我签了名
<15-26,CASTLE>Yeah. He even autographed the book for me.

<15-27,RYAN>太好了  不是吗
<15-27,RYAN>Oh, isn't that lovely?

<15-29,RYAN>Oh, hate to burst your bubble, though.

328
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:28,310
<15-29,RYAN>可他根本不是P·J·莫菲特
<15-29,RYAN>He ended up not being P.J. Moffet after all.

329
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:29,480
<15-29,RYAN>他是个骗子
<15-29,RYAN>Guy was a con man.

<15-30,CASTLE>-不是吧  -真的吗  不要啊

332
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,130
<15-31,ESPOSITO>这都无法证明
<15-31,ESPOSITO>it doesn't prove

<15-31,ESPOSITO>你的新死党比利  没有杀大卫
<15-31,ESPOSITO>that your new BFF, Billy, didn't off Dave.

334
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,790
<15-32,CASTLE>是的  可是他有不在场证据
<15-32,CASTLE>No, it doesn't, but his alibi does.

<15-33,CASTLE>-是的  -在案发时
<15-33,CASTLE>- Yeah. - At the time of the murder,

<15-33,CASTLE>he was front row at "The Lion King."

337
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:46,840

<15-34,CASTLE>before you put Dave in the trunk.

343
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,610
<15-34,CASTLE>在公寓外面和一个高个子的人
<15-34,CASTLE>having this knockdown, drag-out argument

344
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:02,050
<15-34,CASTLE>激烈的争论
<15-34,CASTLE>with some tall guy outside his apartment house.

345
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,030
<15-34,CASTLE>这个人对大卫说
<15-34,CASTLE>So the guy says to Dave,

00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:06,210
<15-34,CASTLE>你最好遵守你的承诺
<15-34,CASTLE>"Hey, you better come through, like you promised,

<15-34,CASTLE>or there's gonna be serious consequences."

348
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:13,310
<16-1,CASTLE>承认吧  他是个挺好的人
<16-1,CASTLE>Admit it -- he's not so bad of a guy.

349
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,420
<16-2,RYAN>卡塞尔  就算他的不在场证明成立
<16-2,RYAN>Castle, just because his alibi held

350
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,600
<16-2,RYAN>另外他还付了午饭钱
<16-2,RYAN>and he paid for lunch

351
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,560
<16-2,RYAN>也不意味着他是好人
<16-2,RYAN>doesn't make him a great humanitarian.

352
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,470
<16-2,RYAN>他以杀人谋生
<16-2,RYAN>He kills people for a living.

353
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:20,200
<16-3,CASTLE>对  但是如果没有他这样的人
<16-3,CASTLE>Yes, but without people like him,

354
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,130
<16-3,CASTLE>我们这样的人就要失业了
<16-3,CASTLE>people like us would be out of a job.

355
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:23,850
<16-4,ESPOSITO>我们接下来去干什么
<16-4,ESPOSITO>Now, what's our next move?

<16-3,CASTLE>找到这个神秘人  核实他的身份
<16-3,CASTLE>Locate and identify this mystery man?

357
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,250
<16-4,ESPOSITO>不  那是我们要去干的事
<16-4,ESPOSITO>No. That's our next move.

358
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,820
<16-5,RYAN>你下一步要回家
<16-5,RYAN>Your next move is to go home.

359
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,810
<16-5,RYAN>贝克特不想让你来调查这案子  抱歉
<16-5,RYAN>Beckett doesn't want you working the case. I'm sorry.

360
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:32,410
<16-6,CASTLE>不  我明白  完全理解
<16-6,CASTLE>No. Uh, I get it. Totally understand.

361
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:34,890
<16-7,CASTLE>我回去  给我的客户汇报情况
<16-7,CASTLE>I'll circle back 'round and, uh, update my client.

362
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:38,290
<16-8,ESPOSITO>卡塞尔
<16-8,ESPOSITO>Castle.

363
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:40,480
<16-9,CASTLE>这  这有点过了
<16-9,CASTLE>That's -- yeah. That's too much.

364
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:48,480
<17-1,CARL>噢  警监  我的警监
<17-1,CARL>O captain, my captain.

365
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:49,610
<17-1,CARL>卡尔
<17-1,CARL>Carl.

366
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,000
<17-2,BECKETT>谢谢你从鉴证科过来
<17-2,BECKETT>Thank you for coming up from CSU.

367
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:56,340
<17-2,BECKETT>我需要你帮我介绍一下毒品的特性
<17-2,BECKETT>I need you to give me a rundown of narcotic signatures --

368
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,680
<17-2,BECKETT>明确说是海洛因
<17-2,BECKETT>Specifically heroin.

369
00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:02,470
<17-3,CARL>基本上  每一批海洛因都像雪花一样
<17-3,CARL>Basically, every batch of heroin is like a snowflake.

370
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:04,070
<17-3,CARL>每一批都不一样
<17-3,CARL>No two are alike.

371
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,780
<17-3,CARL>要决定样本是否来源于同一批货
<17-3,CARL>To determine if samples are from the same batch, we run

372
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,690
<17-3,CARL>我们用色析法分析杂质特征
<17-3,CARL>a chromatographic impurity signature profile analysis.

373
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:10,580
<17-3,CARL>明白
<17-3,CARL>Okay.

374
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,740
<17-4,BECKETT>如果说我有一份海洛因样本
<17-4,BECKETT>Um, let's say I have a sample of heroin

375
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,960
<17-4,BECKETT>然后我把它与另一份样本对比
<17-4,BECKETT>and I compare it to another sample,

376
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,240
<17-4,BECKETT>这就可以帮我确定
<17-4,BECKETT>and that'll help me determine

377
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,140
<17-4,BECKETT>他们是否来自于同一来源
<17-4,BECKETT>whether they originated from the same source?

378
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,250
<17-5,CARL>正是
<17-5,CARL>Exactamundo.

379
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:23,310
<17-6,BECKETT>谢谢  这正是我所需要的
<17-6,BECKETT>Thank you. That's all I needed.

381
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,620
<17-9,ESPOSITO>你为什么找鉴证组负责毒品的人过来
<17-9,ESPOSITO>Hey, what are you meeting with CUS's narcotics guy for?

382
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,690
<17-10,BECKETT>你知道  埃斯波  我还有其他
<17-10,BECKETT>You know, Espo, I do have other cases

383
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:34,170
<17-10,BECKETT>需要监管的案子
<17-10,BECKETT>that I have to supervise.

384
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,290
<17-11,ESPOSITO>抱歉  警监
<17-11,ESPOSITO>My apologies, captain.

385
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:37,550
<17-12,BECKETT>寻找那个神秘人有什么进展吗
<17-12,BECKETT>So, any luck on finding that mystery man?

386
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:40,160
<17-13,ESPOSITO>莱恩正在看大卫家附近的街道监控录像
<17-13,ESPOSITO>Ryan's scrubbing street-cam footage near Dave's apartment.

387
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,170
<17-13,ESPOSITO>但我觉得我们遗漏了一些细节
<17-13,ESPOSITO>But, yo, I think we're missing something here.

388
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:43,980
<17-14,BECKETT>什么意思
<17-14,BECKETT>What do you mean?

389
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,820
<17-15,ESPOSITO>如果大卫是一个诈骗大师
<17-15,ESPOSITO>Well, if Dave was a scam artist,

390
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,870
<17-15,ESPOSITO>他就是我所知道最奇怪的一个
<17-15,ESPOSITO>he is the oddest one I ever heard of.

391
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,310
<17-15,ESPOSITO>他确实表现出了骗子的行为
<17-15,ESPOSITO>I mean, yes, he was exhibiting con-man behavior,

392
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:51,820
<17-15,ESPOSITO>但为了什么
<17-15,ESPOSITO>but to what end?

393
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:53,860
<17-16,BECKETT>为了骗人
<17-16,BECKETT>Uh, to rip people off.

394
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,600
<17-17,ESPOSITO>骗谁  他妻子
<17-17,ESPOSITO>Who? His wife?

395
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:57,330
<17-17,ESPOSITO>她并非来自有钱家庭
<17-17,ESPOSITO>She didn't come from money.

396
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:58,910
<17-17,ESPOSITO>那个神父宣誓恪守清贫
<17-17,ESPOSITO>The priest took a vow of poverty.

397
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:01,780
<17-17,ESPOSITO>至于那个工会的家伙  大卫没跟他要过钱
<17-17,ESPOSITO>And the union guy -- Dave never asked him for a payoff.

398
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:03,010
<17-18,BECKETT>对  有道理
<17-18,BECKETT>Okay, that's a good point.

399
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:05,080
<17-18,BECKETT>那么大卫的骗局有什么利可图呢
<17-18,BECKETT>So what's the upside to Dave's cons?

400
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:09,230
<17-19,RYAN>我确定威胁大卫的神秘人的身份了
<17-19,RYAN>So, I I.D.'d our mystery man who threatened Dave.

401
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:12,920
<17-19,RYAN>他叫埃里克·洛根  他是个被定罪的诈骗大师
<17-19,RYAN>Guy's name is Eric Logan. He's a convicted scam artist.

402
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,530
<17-19,RYAN>两次袭人
<17-19,RYAN>Two collars for assault,

403
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:16,020
<17-19,RYAN>其中一次还是用了致命武器
<17-19,RYAN>including one with a deadly weapon.

404
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:18,170
<17-20,BECKETT>也许埃里克和大卫在一起设下骗局
<17-20,BECKETT>You know, maybe Eric and Dave were working a con together

405
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:19,530
<17-20,BECKETT>但出了些问题
<17-20,BECKETT>and something went wrong.

406
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:20,820
<17-20,BECKETT>你知道埃里克现在在哪吗
<17-20,BECKETT>Any idea where Eric is now?

407
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,590
<17-21,RYAN>知道  我追踪了他的手机  我们有他的定位
<17-21,RYAN>Yeah. I pinged his cell. We got a location.

408
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:23,750
<17-22,ESPOSITO>我们去接他吧
<17-22,ESPOSITO>Let's go pick him up.

409
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,370
<17-23,UNIFORM>证据室
<17-23,UNIFORM>Evidence Room.

410
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:39,900
<17-24,BECKETT>我是贝克特警监
<17-24,BECKETT>Yeah, this is captain Beckett.

411
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,280
<17-24,BECKETT>我们还有瓦肯·西蒙斯案件中
<17-24,BECKETT>Do we still have the seized heroin

412
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,420
<17-24,BECKETT>缴获的海洛因吗
<17-24,BECKETT>from the Vulcan Simmons case?

414
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,460
<17-25,UNIFORM>等一下  让我核对一下
<17-25,UNIFORM>Hang on. Let me check.

<19-2,ERIC>大卫的谎言最终让他得到了惩罚
<19-2,ERIC>Dave's lies finally caught up with him.

<19-6,CASTLE>大卫不是骗子  他是病态撒谎者
<19-6,CASTLE>Dave wasn't a con man. He was a pathological liar.

<20-6,ESPOSITO>Okay. Fine.

478
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,560

492
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:12,370
<20-15,ERIC>我觉得你最新一本就是无聊的改写而已
<20-15,ERIC>And I think your last book was a boring retread.

<20-18,ERIC>A man who obviously wears lifts

497
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:23,540
<20-18,ERIC>这样就可以谎报身高了
<20-18,ERIC>so he can lie about his height.

498
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,280
<20-19,RYAN>才不是  这不是内增高
<20-19,RYAN>No, no. T-these aren't lifts.

501
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:33,360
<20-20,ERIC>你明显是染了头发  好隐瞒年龄

<20-22,CASTLE>好吧  就假定你说的
<20-22,CASTLE>Okay, l-l-let's assume what you're saying...

504
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:41,920
<20-22,CASTLE>是
<20-22,CASTLE>Is...

505
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:42,550
<20-22,CASTLE>是真的

506
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:44,130
<20-22,CASTLE>你说大卫有麻烦
<20-22,CASTLE>You said Dave was in trouble.

507
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,180
<20-22,CASTLE>是什么样的麻烦
<20-22,CASTLE>What kind of trouble?

508
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,810
<20-23,ERIC>是几周前开始的
<20-23,ERIC>It started a couple weeks ago.

509
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,270
<20-23,ERIC>他又犯病了
<20-23,ERIC>He fell off the wagon.

510
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:51,950
<20-23,ERIC>开始无法控制地撒谎  他很害怕
<20-23,ERIC>He started lying out of control, and he was scared.

511
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:52,980
<20-24,RYAN>害怕什么
<20-24,RYAN>Scared of what?

512
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,610
<20-25,ERIC>他发现了一些事情
<20-25,ERIC>And he had uncovered something --

513
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:56,680
<20-25,ERIC>一些危险非法的事情
<20-25,ERIC>Something dangerous, illegal.

514
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:58,130
<20-26,ESPOSITO>为什么他不报警呢
<20-26,ESPOSITO>Why didn't he come to the cops?

515
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:00,600
<20-27,ERIC>他对太多人说过太多谎
<20-27,ERIC>Oh, he'd lied so many times to so many people --

516
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:01,770
<20-27,ERIC>甚至他的妻子
<20-27,ERIC>Even his own wife --

517
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,300
<20-27,ERIC>他知道没有人会相信他
<20-27,ERIC>He knew nobody would believe him.

518
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,670
<20-27,ERIC>他就是狼来了故事里面的男孩
<20-27,ERIC>He was the boy that cried wolf.

519
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:06,350
<20-27,ERIC>不管是什么
<20-27,ERIC>But whatever it was,

520
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:10,710
<20-27,ERIC>他说他需要找到证据才能把这事公开
<20-27,ERIC>he said he needed proof before he could go public.

521
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,580
<21-1,BECKETT>把什么事公开
<21-1,BECKETT>Go public with what?

522
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,540
<21-2,RYAN>他不知道
<21-2,RYAN>He didn't know.

523
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:15,760
<21-3,BECKETT>你觉得这个担保人说的是真的吗
<21-3,BECKETT>And you think that this sponsor's telling the truth?

524
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,950
<21-4,ESPOSITO>就目前来看是的
<21-4,ESPOSITO>Well, as far as we could tell.

525
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:18,950
<21-4,ESPOSITO>此外他的不在场证据很可靠
<21-4,ESPOSITO>Plus, his alibi is rock-solid for the murder.

526
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:20,270
<21-5,BECKETT>我们得查明大卫两周前
<21-5,BECKETT>We got to figure out what Dave was onto

527
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:21,700
<21-5,BECKETT>到底发现了什么  让他丧了命
<21-5,BECKETT>two weeks ago that got him killed.

528

<21-6,RYAN>已经在查了
<21-6,RYAN>Already on it.

<22-12,RYAN>更何况贝克特现在是我们上司
<22-12,RYAN>Plus, Beckett's our boss now.

559
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,150
<22-12,RYAN>她不想让你插手案子
<22-12,RYAN>She doesn't want you working cases.

561
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:42,870
<22-13,CASTLE>而我唯一能想到的方法
<22-13,CASTLE>The only way I know how to do that

562
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:45,450
<22-13,CASTLE>就是和她一起解决谋杀案  所以我不会放弃
<22-13,CASTLE>is solving murders together, so I'm not going anywhere.

00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:47,990
<22-13,CASTLE>所以别管那些  放松享受一番吧
<22-13,CASTLE>So sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride.

<22-13,CASTLE>试试玉米脆饼  那上面可是神户牛肉
<22-13,CASTLE>And try the tostadas. They're wagyu beef.

00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:52,460
<22-14,ESPOSITO>我倒是想尝尝神户牛肉
<22-14,ESPOSITO>Ah. I do love me some wagyu.

568
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:04,340
<22-16,RYAN>噢  没事

<22-16,RYAN>回家路上顺便带点东西
<22-16,RYAN>To pick up some stuff on the way home.

571
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:09,680
<22-16,RYAN>是吗
<22-16,RYAN>Really?

572
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,210
<22-17,ESPOSITO>不过那个短信怎么写着"警长考试"呢
<22-17,ESPOSITO>'cause that text message said "Sergeant's exam."

573
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:20,790
<22-18,RYAN>好吧  我之前或许说了点小谎
<22-18,RYAN>Okay. Uh, I may have lied...earlier.

574
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:25,070
<22-18,RYAN>之前确实有职位开放报考  但是只有一个
<22-18,RYAN>There was an exam slot open, but only one.

575
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:31,350
<22-19,ESPOSITO>你就报名了  却根本就没跟我说
<22-19,ESPOSITO>So you took it -- without even talking to me?

576
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:33,360
<22-19,ESPOSITO>-哥们  那可是我的主意  -很抱歉
<22-19,ESPOSITO>- Bro, that was my idea. - I'm sorry.

577
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,780
<22-20,RYAN>你知道我最近有多缺钱
<22-20,RYAN>You know how stressed out about money I've been lately.

578
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,410
<22-20,RYAN>加薪对我相当有帮助
<22-20,RYAN>A bump in pay would really help.

579
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:38,930
<22-20,RYAN>哈维  别走啊
<22-20,RYAN>Javi -- hey!

00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,690
<22-22,CASTLE>你有些经济困难
<22-22,CASTLE>about your financial concerns.

583
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:49,080
<22-22,CASTLE>也许我们可以合作
<22-22,CASTLE>Maybe you and I could work together.

584
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,030
<22-23,RYAN>怎么合作
<22-23,RYAN>How?

585
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:56,370
<22-24,CASTLE>就当是替我搞点小副业
<22-24,CASTLE>Do a little, uh, moonlighting for me.

586
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:58,990
<22-24,CASTLE>只要把12分局的动静都告诉我一声
<22-24,CASTLE>Just keep me in the loop as to what's going on at the 12th.

587
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:00,940
<22-25,RYAN>你想让我给你当内奸  才不要呢
<22-25,RYAN>You want me to be a rat for you? Hell no.

588
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,520
<22-26,CASTLE>我一周付你500美元
<22-26,CASTLE>I would pay you $500 a week.

589
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,400
<22-27,RYAN>我干
<22-27,RYAN>I'll do it.

590
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:11,110
<23-1,RYAN>嘿  好搭档
<23-1,RYAN>Hey, partner.

591
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,310
<23-1,RYAN>餐车在附近  我就给你买了早餐
<23-1,RYAN>Food truck is here, so I got you some breakfast --

592
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:17,290
<23-1,RYAN>双份辣酱  就是你喜欢的那种
<23-1,RYAN>double salsa, just the way you like it.

593
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,610
<23-2,ESPOSITO>谢谢了
<23-2,ESPOSITO>Oh. Hey. Thanks.

594
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:23,270
<23-3,RYAN>你做什么
<23-3,RYAN>What the hell?

595
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:25,940
<23-4,ESPOSITO>我只是像你对待我一样处理了那个玉米煎饼
<23-4,ESPOSITO>Uh, I was just treating that burrito like you treated me.

596
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:28,400
<23-5,RYAN>是的我向你撒了谎  对不起
<23-5,RYAN>Okay, I lied to you. I'm -- I'm sorry.

597
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,930
<23-5,RYAN>我有需要承担的责任
<23-5,RYAN>I have responsibilities.

598
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,560
<23-6,ESPOSITO>我猜你的责任不包括
<23-6,ESPOSITO>I guess looking out for your partner's back

599
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,700
<23-6,ESPOSITO>关照你的搭档
<23-6,ESPOSITO>Isn't one of them.

600
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:34,740
<23-7,BECKETT>你们没事吧
<23-7,BECKETT>You guys okay?

601
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:36,130
<23-8,ESPOSITO>好着呢  怎么啦
<23-8,ESPOSITO>Fine. What's up?

602
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:37,620
<23-9,BECKETT>我需要你们去一趟市政厅
<23-9,BECKETT>I need you to go down to city hall.

603
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:39,530
<23-9,BECKETT>大卫的老板说他两周前在那边
<23-9,BECKETT>Dave's boss said that Dave had an incident there

604
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:42,040
<23-9,BECKETT>出了点纠纷  所以他所属的门卫公司
<23-9,BECKETT>two weeks ago, and his janitorial company

605
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,370
<23-9,BECKETT>不得不把他调去别的部门看门
<23-9,BECKETT>Was forced to reassign him to another facility.

606
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:45,510
<23-10,RYAN>什么纠纷
<23-10,RYAN>What kind of incident?

607
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:48,100
<23-11,ESPOSITO>我想她就是要让我们去那里
<23-11,ESPOSITO>I think that's what she's sending us down there

608
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,330
<23-11,ESPOSITO>查清楚是什么纠纷
<23-11,ESPOSITO>to find out.

609
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:51,330
<23-12,RYAN>好的  我们这就去
<23-12,RYAN>Yeah, we're on it.

610
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:52,150
<23-13,BECKETT>好
<23-13,BECKETT>Okay.

611
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,020
<24-1,CASTLE>你有什么消息告诉我
<24-1,CASTLE>What have you got for me?

612
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:57,050
<24-2,RYAN>看来
<24-2,RYAN>Yeah, apparently,

613
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:59,550
<24-2,RYAN>受害者在市政厅跟人发生过冲突
<24-2,RYAN>our vic had some sort of confrontation down at city hall,

614
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:01,740
<24-2,RYAN>我们正要去跟他们的办公室副主任谈谈
<24-2,RYAN>so we're running down there to talk to the deputy chief of staff.

615
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:04,680
<24-2,RYAN>我也爱你  亲爱的  再见
<24-2,RYAN>I love you, too, sweetie. Bye-bye.

616
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,400
<24-3,CASTLE>怪怪的
<24-3,CASTLE>That was weird.

617
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:08,250
<24-4,ALEXIS>什么
<24-4,ALEXIS>What?

618
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,630
<24-5,CASTLE>莱恩跟我说他爱我
<24-5,CASTLE>Ryan just told me he loved me.

619
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,140
<24-5,CASTLE>我确定他只是在打掩护
<24-5,CASTLE>I'm sure he was just covering.

620
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,860
<24-6,ALEXIS>难道你把他变成你的内鬼
<24-6,ALEXIS>Don't you feel the least bit conflicted

621
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:16,290
<24-6,ALEXIS>就一点都没有过意不去吗
<24-6,ALEXIS>about turning him into a mole?

622
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:18,070
<24-7,CASTLE>他又不是在盗窃国家机密
<24-7,CASTLE>He's not stealing state secrets.

623
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,540
<24-7,CASTLE>我只是雇他帮我跟进他们的案情
<24-7,CASTLE>I'm just paying him to keep me in the loop on their cases.

624
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:23,750
<24-8,ALEXIS>然后你就能在该案件中拼命炫技
<24-8,ALEXIS>So you can ingratiate yourself in said cases

625
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:25,400
<24-8,ALEXIS>找到新的方法和贝克特套近乎
<24-8,ALEXIS>and find new ways to interact with Beckett.

626
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,750
<24-9,CASTLE>如果你说的"拼命炫技"
<24-9,CASTLE>Well, if by "Ingratiate myself,"

627
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:29,340
<24-9,CASTLE>意思是说"用我福尔摩斯般的睿智打动她"
<24-9,CASTLE>You mean "Dazzle her with my Sherlockian genius,"

628
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:31,540
<24-9,CASTLE>那么  没错  我就是要这么做
<24-9,CASTLE>Then, yes, that's exactly what I mean.

629
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:33,130
<24-10,ALEXIS>那么  莱恩说了什么
<24-10,ALEXIS>So, what did Ryan say?

630
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:35,510
<24-11,CASTLE>受害人在市政厅惹过一些麻烦
<24-11,CASTLE>That our victim got himself into some trouble at city hall

631
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:37,000
<24-11,CASTLE>也许他就是因为这个被杀的
<24-11,CASTLE>that might have got him killed.

632
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,350
<24-11,CASTLE>所以你看我给我的市长好哥们打个电话怎么样
<24-11,CASTLE>So what do you say we call my good buddy the mayor?

633
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:43,290
<24-12,ALEXIS>大卫就是个门卫  老爸
<24-12,ALEXIS>Dave was a janitor, dad.

634
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:45,570
<24-12,ALEXIS>我强烈怀疑市长会注意到他
<24-12,ALEXIS>I sincerely doubt he was on the mayor's radar.

635
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,820
<25-1,STEPHEN REED>我们解雇了大卫·约翰逊
<25-1,STEPHEN REED>We fired Dave Johnson

636
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:51,480
<25-1,STEPHEN REED>因为他闯进了会计办公室
<25-1,STEPHEN REED>after he broke into the accounting office.

637
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:54,130
<25-1,STEPHEN REED>而且保安抓住他的时候他还试图逃跑
<25-1,STEPHEN REED>And he tried to run when security caught him.

638
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:56,090
<25-2,RYAN>那么  被抓住的时候他说什么了吗
<25-2,RYAN>Well, what did he say when they caught him?

639
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:57,360
<25-3,STEPHEN>一些胡言乱语
<25-3,STEPHEN>Oh, some nonsense

640
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:59,490
<25-3,STEPHEN>上帝派给他的任务什么什么的
<25-3,STEPHEN>about being on a mission from god or something --

641
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:00,750
<25-3,STEPHEN>考虑到他得到这份工作的原因
<25-3,STEPHEN>which was incredibly disrespectful,

642
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:02,910
<25-3,STEPHEN>那些话实在是非常无礼
<25-3,STEPHEN>Given how he got the job in the first place.

643
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:03,860
<25-4,ESPOSITO>他怎么得到的
<25-4,ESPOSITO>And how's that?

644
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:07,340
<25-5,STEPHEN>他是圣马克教堂的阿圭罗神父推荐来的
<25-5,STEPHEN>Oh, he was recommended by father Arguello at st. Mark's.

645
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,460
<25-6,RYAN>那个盲人神父
<25-6,RYAN>The blind priest?

646
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:09,150
<25-7,STEPHEN>是的  怎么
<25-7,STEPHEN>Yeah. So?

647
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,990
<25-8,ESPOSITO>大卫在阿圭罗的教堂被杀了
<25-8,ESPOSITO>Dave was killed in arguello's church.

648
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:16,410
<25-9,STEPHEN>我不是警探  不过这听起来像个线索
<25-9,STEPHEN>Well, look, I-I'm no detective, but that sounds like a clue.

649
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:17,950
<25-9,STEPHEN>抱歉我失陪一下
<25-9,STEPHEN>Uh, if you'll excuse me...

650
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:21,650
<25-11,ESPOSITO>看来我们得跟神父谈谈了  走吧
<25-11,ESPOSITO>Looks like we need to talk to the good father. Let's go.

651
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:23,530
<25-12,RYAN>等等  稍等一下
<25-12,RYAN>Oh, wait. Just a second.

652
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,690
<25-12,RYAN>我先跟珍妮说句话
<25-12,RYAN>Um, make a quick phone call to Jenny.

653
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:26,510
<25-12,RYAN>马上过去
<25-12,RYAN>Be right there.

654
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:31,720
<26-1,ALEXIS>上帝的任务
<26-1,ALEXIS>A mission from god?

655
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,900
<26-2,CASTLE>莱恩是这么说的
<26-2,CASTLE>Well, that's what Ryan said.

656
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:34,970
<26-2,CASTLE>但是  大卫是个说谎强迫症
<26-2,CASTLE>On the other hand, Dave was a compulsive liar.

657
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,640
<26-3,ALEXIS>但大多数谎言还是包含一点真相的
<26-3,ALEXIS>Still, most lies have a kernel of truth in them.

658
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,830
<26-4,CASTLE>就像你去时装周的时候
<26-4,CASTLE>Like when you went to fashion week,

659
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:40,930
<26-4,CASTLE>故意没有提到
<26-4,CASTLE>but you neglected to mention

660
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:42,400
<26-4,CASTLE>你是拿着我的白金卡去的
<26-4,CASTLE>That you were taking my platinum credit card?

661
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,680
<26-5,ALEXIS>我把更多的心思放在被害人身上
<26-5,ALEXIS>I was more thinking about our victim

662
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,610
<26-5,ALEXIS>他谎称自己是逃亡的暴徒
<26-5,ALEXIS>and how he lied about being a fugitive mobster

663
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:47,470
<26-5,ALEXIS>怎么会跟调查工会回扣扯上关系呢
<26-5,ALEXIS>in order to investigate union kickbacks.

664
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:49,490
<26-6,CASTLE>回扣可能会跟市政厅有关联
<26-6,CASTLE>Kickbacks that could be connected to City Hall --

665
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:51,770
<26-6,CASTLE>所以  大卫就闯进了会计室
<26-6,CASTLE>Hence, Dave breaking into the accounting office.

666
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,900
<26-7,ALEXIS>但这些事跟盲人神父有什么联系呢
<26-7,ALEXIS>But what does any of this have to do with a blind priest?

667
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:59,340
<26-8,CASTLE>问[求]  就必得着[约翰福音16:24]
<26-8,CASTLE>Ask, and ye shall receive.

668
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,320
<27-1,CASTLE>打扰了  神父
<27-1,CASTLE>Uh, excuse me, father.

669
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,800
<27-1,CASTLE>我们在调查大卫·约翰逊的谋杀案
<27-1,CASTLE>We are investigating Dave Johnson's murder.

670
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,960
<27-1,CASTLE>鉴于您跟他的关系
<27-1,CASTLE>We'd like to ask you a few questions

671
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:09,840
<27-1,CASTLE>我们想问您几个问题
<27-1,CASTLE>regarding your relationship with him.

672
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,960
<27-2,ARGUELLO>我是他的神父  孩子
<27-2,ARGUELLO>I was his priest, my son.

673
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:14,330
<27-2,ARGUELLO>我给他精神上的指引
<27-2,ARGUELLO>I gave him spiritual guidance.

674
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,370
<27-3,CASTLE>究竟哪部分指引
<27-3,CASTLE>And which part of that guidance

675
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:18,610
<27-3,CASTLE>会让他非法闯入市政厅呢
<27-3,CASTLE>included breaking and entering at City Hall?

676
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,320
<27-4,ALEXIS>盲人神父居然跑起来了
<27-4,ALEXIS>The blind priest just ran away.

677
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:30,030
<27-5,CASTLE>完了要撞上了
<27-5,CASTLE>This cannot end well.

678
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,310
<27-5,CASTLE>-看着点  -小心
<27-5,CASTLE>- Hey! - Hey, watch it!

679
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:36,000
<27-6,ALEXIS>我们是不是该...
<27-6,ALEXIS>Should we...

680
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,790
<27-7,CASTLE>该死  追
<27-7,CASTLE>Damn it. Yes.

681
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:45,760
<27-7,CASTLE>什么
<27-7,CASTLE>What?!

682
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:48,020
<28-1,BECKETT>让我概括一下
<28-1,BECKETT>So, let me get this straight --

683
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:51,670
<28-1,BECKETT>你被一个盲人神父甩了
<28-1,BECKETT>You got parkoured by a blind priest?

684
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,390
<28-2,CASTLE>我要说  他是否失明值得商榷
<28-2,CASTLE>I'd say the blindness is under dispute.

685
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:56,880
<28-3,BECKETT>那他已经60高龄了  你又该怎么说呢
<28-3,BECKETT>And what about the fact that he's 60?

686
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,370
<28-3,BECKETT>他的年龄也是假的吗
<28-3,BECKETT>Was he faking his age, too?

687
00:27:58,370 --> 00:27:59,700
<28-4,CASTLE>60岁老当益壮赛20
<28-4,CASTLE>60 is the new 20.

688
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,210
<28-4,CASTLE>你打电话就是为了取笑我的吗
<28-4,CASTLE>Did you call just to bust my chops?

689
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:02,790
<28-5,BECKETT>是啊  差不多吧
<28-5,BECKETT>Yeah. Pretty much.

690
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,820
<28-5,BECKETT>好了  飞毛腿  我要挂了
<28-5,BECKETT>Um, all right, speedy, I got to go.

691
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,400
<28-5,BECKETT>睡前一定要做拉伸运动啊
<28-5,BECKETT>Make sure you stretch before bed.

692
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:13,960
<29-1,CASTLE>他们抓住那个神父了
<29-1,CASTLE>They got the priest.

693
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:15,100
<29-2,ALEXIS>你怎么知道的
<29-2,ALEXIS>How do you know?

694
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,460
<29-3,CASTLE>贝克特有点太开心了
<29-3,CASTLE>Beckett was having too much fun.

695
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:17,870
<29-3,CASTLE>等等
<29-3,CASTLE>Wait.

696
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,720
<29-3,CASTLE>贝克特在跟我开玩笑
<29-3,CASTLE>Beckett was having fun -- with me.

697
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:22,630
<29-3,CASTLE>得分
<29-3,CASTLE>Score.

698
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:25,680
<29-4,ALEXIS>设想一下她审问那个落跑神父会有多开心吧
<29-4,ALEXIS>Imagine how much fun she's gonna have with the runaway priest.

699
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:27,280
<30-1,ARGUELLO>我能跟你说实话吗
<30-1,ARGUELLO>Can I be honest with you?

700
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:29,780
<30-1,ARGUELLO>我装瞎是为了逃离坦帕市
<30-1,ARGUELLO>I went blind to get out of Tampa.

701
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:33,490
<30-1,ARGUELLO>那里的日子简直不是人过的
<30-1,ARGUELLO>It was miserable down there.

702
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:39,990
<30-2,ARGUELLO>潮湿的天气让人难以忍受
<30-2,ARGUELLO>The humidity was just oppressive.

703
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:43,900
<30-2,ARGUELLO>当我得知如果神父有某些残疾
<30-2,ARGUELLO>When I learned that priests with certain disabilities

704
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:48,780
<30-2,ARGUELLO>就可以选择分配的地方  我丝毫没犹豫
<30-2,ARGUELLO>have their pick of assignments, I-I didn't even hesitate.

705
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,530
<30-3,BECKETT>我不明白这些跟
<30-3,BECKETT>I don't understand what any of this

706
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:55,000
<30-3,BECKETT>大卫·约翰逊的谋杀案有什么关系
<30-3,BECKETT>has to do with Dave Johnson's murder.

707
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,940
<30-4,ARGUELLO>大卫爱撒谎的毛病是他沉重的负担
<30-4,ARGUELLO>Dave's lying was a terrible burden --

708
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:02,480
<30-4,ARGUELLO>他从童年时就开始背负这个负担
<30-4,ARGUELLO>One that he'd been carrying since childhood.

709
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:06,420
<30-4,ARGUELLO>我给他指了一条赎罪的路
<30-4,ARGUELLO>I offered him a way to make amends.

710
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:08,480
<30-5,BECKETT>你现在还在说实话是吗
<30-5,BECKETT>And this is you still being honest?

711
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,240
<30-5,BECKETT>是的
<30-5,BECKETT>Yes.

712
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:13,050
<30-6,ARGUELLO>大卫说谎的毛病毁了他的会计生涯
<30-6,ARGUELLO>Dave's lying torpedoed his accounting career.

713
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:15,550
<30-6,ARGUELLO>所以他才在市政厅做门卫
<30-6,ARGUELLO>That's why he was working as a janitor at City Hall,

714
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:17,580
<30-6,ARGUELLO>假装自己是隐居的作家
<30-6,ARGUELLO>pretending to be a reclusive author.

715
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:23,200
<30-6,ARGUELLO>我的教区有笔给市里的税款马上就要欠缴了
<30-6,ARGUELLO>My parish was about to miss a payment to the city,

716
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:27,050
<30-6,ARGUELLO>因为我...  资金管理不善什么的
<30-6,ARGUELLO>due to my... mismanagement of funds.

717
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:31,300
<30-6,ARGUELLO>我就要求大卫偷偷潜入会计部
<30-6,ARGUELLO>I simply asked Dave to sneak into the accounting office

718
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:35,510
<30-6,ARGUELLO>在电脑上把这笔税款登记为已缴纳
<30-6,ARGUELLO>and log the payment into the computer as received.

719
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,990
<30-7,BECKETT>所以你才不在乎赎罪啊
<30-7,BECKETT>So this wasn't about making amends.

720
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:40,070
<30-7,BECKETT>你是想帮自己的忙
<30-7,BECKETT>This was about helping you.

721
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:43,930
<30-8,ARGUELLO>当大卫侵入市政预算系统时
<30-8,ARGUELLO>When Dave was hacked into the city budget,

722
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:47,430
<30-8,ARGUELLO>他发现了一笔秘密贿赂资金的证据
<30-8,ARGUELLO>he found evidence of a secret slush fund --

723
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:50,760
<30-8,ARGUELLO>从社保项目中抽取了一千万
<30-8,ARGUELLO>$10 million siphoned from social programs

724
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:52,710
<30-8,ARGUELLO>放进了某人的腰包
<30-8,ARGUELLO>to line someone's pocket.

725
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:55,540
<30-8,ARGUELLO>这个谎言大卫无法忍受
<30-8,ARGUELLO>It was a lie Dave couldn't stomach,

726
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:59,130
<30-8,ARGUELLO>所以他发誓要揭露此事
<30-8,ARGUELLO>so he vowed to expose it.

727
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,810
<30-9,BECKETT>而你认为控制那笔
<30-9,BECKETT>And you believe that whoever controlled

728
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:02,950
<30-9,BECKETT>所谓贿赂资金的人
<30-9,BECKETT>this alleged slush fund

729
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:05,200
<30-9,BECKETT>发现了大卫闯入一事
<30-9,BECKETT>discovered Dave's intrusion?

730
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:08,070
<30-10,ARGUELLO>他们因此杀了他
<30-10,ARGUELLO>And they killed him for it.

731
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:12,810
<31-1,RYAN>你认为呢
<31-1,RYAN>Do you think?

732
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,770
<31-2,ESPOSITO>这跟受害者对其担保人说的话相吻合
<31-2,ESPOSITO>It tracks with what our victim told his sponsor.

733
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:17,480
<31-3,RYAN>跟大卫对工会回扣的质疑也吻合
<31-3,RYAN>And with Dave's questions about union kickbacks.

734
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,700
<31-4,BECKETT>这不重要  这根本没什么用
<31-4,BECKETT>It doesn't matter. It's non-actionable.

735
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,910
<31-4,BECKETT>我们不可能仅凭一个装瞎神父
<31-4,BECKETT>There's no way we're gonna get a subpoena for City Hall

736
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,790
<31-4,BECKETT>从一位病态撒谎者那听来的话
<31-4,BECKETT>based on hearsay told to a not-blind priest

737
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:26,630
<31-4,BECKETT>就传唤市政厅
<31-4,BECKETT>from a pathological liar.

738
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:27,550
<31-5,ESPOSITO>我想大卫是对的
<31-5,ESPOSITO>I guess Dave was right --

739
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:29,250
<31-5,ESPOSITO>没有人会相信爱说谎的人说的话
<31-5,ESPOSITO>No one believes the boy who cries wolf.

740
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:30,170
<31-6,RYAN>那你说该怎么办  放弃吗
<31-6,RYAN>So what are you saying -- we give up?

741
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:31,480
<31-6,RYAN>那可不是我认识的贝克特会做的事
<31-6,RYAN>Because that's not the Beckett that I know.

742
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,790
<31-7,BECKETT>不  我没说要放弃
<31-7,BECKETT>No, I'm not saying that we should give up.

743
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:35,300
<31-7,BECKETT>我要说的是  我才刚就任警监
<31-7,BECKETT>What I am saying is, I've been a captain for about five minutes.

744
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,640
<31-7,BECKETT>如果我们就这么上报地检
<31-7,BECKETT>If we take this to the D.A.,

745
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,690
<31-7,BECKETT>以后就没人会把我当回事了
<31-7,BECKETT>nobody's gonna take me seriously ever.

746
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:40,010
<31-8,RYAN>好吧  我们会找到证据的
<31-8,RYAN>Okay. We'll get proof.

747
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:40,930
<31-8,RYAN>钱肯定找不到了
<31-8,RYAN>Money's gone.

748
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,380
<31-9,ESPOSITO>就算的确有一笔贿赂资金
<31-9,ESPOSITO>Even if there is a secret slush fund,

749
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,920
<31-9,ESPOSITO>控制它的人杀了大卫灭口后
<31-9,ESPOSITO>the person controlling it killed Dave to cover it up,

750
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,930
<31-9,ESPOSITO>肯定把钱藏了起来  抹去所有痕迹了
<31-9,ESPOSITO>buried the money deep, covered his tracks.

751
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:49,270
<31-10,RYAN>那我们又该怎么找呢
<31-10,RYAN>So what are we supposed to do?

752
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:50,680
<31-11,BECKETT>我们仔细查
<31-11,BECKETT>We do our homework.

753
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:54,060
<31-11,BECKETT>我们去查谁可以从市政预算中调出贿赂资金
<31-11,BECKETT>We find out who could pull off a slush fund in the city budget,

754
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,850
<31-11,BECKETT>也就是说我们必须去找
<31-11,BECKETT>which means we have to talk to someone

755
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:58,310
<31-11,BECKETT>在市政厅有关系的人
<31-11,BECKETT>with contacts and resources in City Hall.

756
00:30:58,310 --> 00:31:02,110
<31-12,RYAN>某位和市长是好哥们的人
<31-12,RYAN>Someone who's best friends with the mayor?

757
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:03,960
<31-12,RYAN>比如...  卡塞尔
<31-12,RYAN>Someone like... Castle?

758
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,110
<31-13,BECKETT>这样会让他洋洋得意的
<31-13,BECKETT>He's gonna be so smug about this.

759
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:12,430
<32-1,CASTLE>抱歉  你刚才说什么  需要我帮忙吗
<32-1,CASTLE>I'm sorry. Did you say you... needed my help?

760
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:13,570
<32-2,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<32-2,BECKETT>Castle.

761
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:14,720
<32-3,CASTLE>你听见她的话了  是吗
<32-3,CASTLE>You heard her say it, right?

762
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,470
<32-4,ALEXIS>-爸爸  别闹了  -多谢
<32-4,ALEXIS>- Dad, let it go. - Thank you.

763
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:18,850
<32-5,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你到底有没有我们需要的情报
<32-5,BECKETT>Castle, do you have the intel we need or not?

764
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:21,180
<32-6,CASTLE>你跟她说
<32-6,CASTLE>Tell her.

765
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:22,690
<32-7,ALEXIS>我上中学的时候
<32-7,ALEXIS>When I was in middle school,

766
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:24,470
<32-7,ALEXIS>爸爸对市政资金的内部运作
<32-7,ALEXIS>dad did four months of extensive research

767
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:26,040
<32-7,ALEXIS>进行了为期四个月的深入调查
<32-7,ALEXIS>into the inner workings of city finance

768
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,160
<32-7,ALEXIS>为他正在写的小说搜集素材
<32-7,ALEXIS>for a novel he was writing.

769
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,930
<32-8,CASTLE>是的  可然后我意识到那本小说
<32-8,CASTLE>Yes, but then I realized that that novel would be

770
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:31,170
<32-8,CASTLE>会成为小说史上最无聊的一本
<32-8,CASTLE>the most boring novel in the history of novels,

771
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:33,510
<32-8,CASTLE>所以我就改写德里克·斯道姆系列丛书了
<32-8,CASTLE>so I wrote a Derek Storm book instead.

772
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:35,250
<32-9,RYAN>好吧  那么你很清楚
<32-9,RYAN>Okay, so, then, you have a pretty good idea

773
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:36,420
<32-9,RYAN>哪些市公务员
<32-9,RYAN>of which city officials

774
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:38,250
<32-9,RYAN>有能力藏匿一千万美金的贿赂资金
<32-9,RYAN>would be able to hide a $10 million slush fund.

775
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:40,730
<32-10,CASTLE>是的  符合条件的人不多
<32-10,CASTLE>Yes, and it's a pretty small list.

776
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:42,640
<32-10,CASTLE>可以接触到全部预算的人只有
<32-10,CASTLE>The only people with access to the entire budget

777
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:45,260
<32-10,CASTLE>审计主任  市长的办公室主任
<32-10,CASTLE>are the comptroller, the mayor's chief of staff,

778
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,360
<32-10,CASTLE>和副主任
<32-10,CASTLE>and the deputy chief.

779
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,860
<32-11,RYAN>史蒂芬·里德  我们见过那个人
<32-11,RYAN>Stephen Reed -- the guy we met with.

780
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:49,570
<32-12,CASTLE>我确定办公室主任
<32-12,CASTLE>I know for a fact that the chief of staff

781
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:50,900
<32-12,CASTLE>现在正陪同市长在伦敦出访
<32-12,CASTLE>is in London with the mayor.

782
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,470
<32-13,ESPOSITO>我也打了几个电话偷偷地问了一下
<32-13,ESPOSITO>And I made a few discreet calls.

783
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:53,410
<32-13,ESPOSITO>大卫被杀时  市审计主任正在
<32-13,ESPOSITO>The city comptroller was at a fundraiser

784
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:55,020
<32-13,ESPOSITO>出席筹款活动
<32-13,ESPOSITO>when Dave was shot.

785
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:57,240
<32-14,BECKETT>也就是说里德是我们的头号嫌疑犯
<32-14,BECKETT>Which means Reed is our main suspect.

786
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:58,690
<32-15,RYAN>好吧  那我们怎么抓这家伙呢
<32-15,RYAN>Okay, so, how do we get this guy?

787
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:01,690
<32-16,CASTLE>我提议用《午夜狂奔》中的策略
<32-16,CASTLE>May I suggest the "Midnight Run" stratagem?

788
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,780
<32-16,CASTLE>-什么策略  -《午夜狂奔》
<32-16,CASTLE>- The what? - "Midnight Run."

789
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,800
<32-18,CASTLE>这可是影史排名前五的拍档电影
<32-18,CASTLE>It's one of the top five buddy movies of all time.

790
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,620
<32-19,RYAN>而你建议我们遵照这个警察搭档电影
<32-19,RYAN>And you're suggesting we base our legal strategy

791
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:08,800
<32-19,RYAN>来制定我们的执法策略
<32-19,RYAN>upon this buddy-cop movie?

792
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,350
<32-20,BECKETT>不  他说得对  或许行得通
<32-20,BECKETT>No, he's right. It could work.

793
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:11,430
<32-20,BECKETT>在电影的最后
<32-20,BECKETT>At the end of the movie,

794
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:14,080
<32-20,BECKETT>罗伯特·德尼罗设计让匪徒去取一张
<32-20,BECKETT>Robert de Niro tricks a mobster into taking computer discs

795
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,860
<32-20,BECKETT>他以为含有他犯罪证据的数据盘
<32-20,BECKETT>he thinks contain evidence against him,

796
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:17,670
<32-20,BECKETT>匪徒只要去取这些数据盘
<32-20,BECKETT>and just by showing up to take them,

797
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:20,550
<32-20,BECKETT>就会因妨碍司法公正被抓现行
<32-20,BECKETT>the mobster is committing conspiracy to obstruct justice.

798
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:22,120
<32-21,CASTLE>如果我们也同样设计里德
<32-21,CASTLE>If we can trick Reed the same way,

799
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,660
<32-21,CASTLE>那我们就有了足够的把柄
<32-21,CASTLE>then we've got all the leverage we need

800
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:24,640
<32-21,CASTLE>来揭露贿赂资金
<32-21,CASTLE>to expose the slush fund

801
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,050
<32-21,CASTLE>并且追查他跟大卫谋杀案的关系
<32-21,CASTLE>and go after him for Dave's murder.

802
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:29,050
<32-21,CASTLE>但是凯特  你不能参与
<32-21,CASTLE>But, Kate, you can't be involved.

803
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:29,930
<32-22,BECKETT>为什么
<32-22,BECKETT>Why not?

804
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:31,270
<32-23,RYAN>因为万一里德与此事无关
<32-23,RYAN>Because if Reed isn't involved,

805
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:32,620
<32-23,RYAN>那整个行动就会对我们不利
<32-23,RYAN>then all this blows up in our face,

806
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:33,780
<32-23,RYAN>而你将会背上责任
<32-23,RYAN>and you take the hit.

807
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:34,960
<32-24,ESPOSITO>你不能背这锅
<32-24,ESPOSITO>And you don't need that.

808
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:36,640
<32-24,ESPOSITO>让我们挡在你前面吧  警监
<32-24,ESPOSITO>Let us shield you, Captain.

809
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:38,980
<32-24,ESPOSITO>好吧
<32-24,ESPOSITO>Okay.

810
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:41,130
<32-25,BECKETT>我不参与  暂时而已
<32-25,BECKETT>I'm out -- for now.

811
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:43,170
<32-25,BECKETT>谢谢
<32-25,BECKETT>Thanks.

812
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,430
<32-26,RYAN>好吧  咱们怎么做
<32-26,RYAN>Okay, how do we do this?

813
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:52,050
<32-27,CASTLE>首先我要借用一下你们的盲人神父
<32-27,CASTLE>First, I'm gonna need to borrow your blind priest.

814
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:54,350
<33-1,ARGUELLO>里德先生
<33-1,ARGUELLO>Mr. Reed?

815
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:55,900
<33-1,ARGUELLO>里德先生
<33-1,ARGUELLO>Mr. Reed!

816
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:57,870
<33-2,STEPHEN>神父
<33-2,STEPHEN>Father.

817
00:32:58,050 --> 00:32:58,940
<33-2,STEPHEN>你怎么在这
<33-2,STEPHEN>What are you doing here?

818
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:01,270
<33-3,ARGUELLO>你办公室的人说我可以在这找到你
<33-3,ARGUELLO>Uh, your office told me where to find you.

819
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:03,390
<33-4,STEPHEN>抱歉神父
<33-4,STEPHEN>Ah. Well, sorry, Father.

820
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:05,840
<33-4,STEPHEN>见我必须先预约  神职人员也是一样
<33-4,STEPHEN>I'm appointment-only, even for the clergy.

821
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,860
<33-5,ARGUELLO>我认为你不会希望办公室的人听到
<33-5,ARGUELLO>I don't think you want your office to hear

822
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,490
<33-5,ARGUELLO>我要跟你谈的事的
<33-5,ARGUELLO>what we're about to discuss.

823
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:12,890
<33-5,ARGUELLO>大卫·约翰逊是我教会里的信徒
<33-5,ARGUELLO>Dave Johnson was one of my flock.

824
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:16,530
<33-6,STEPHEN>他被炒是因为他闯入了自己不该去的地方
<33-6,STEPHEN>Who got fired for being where he didn't belong.

825
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:18,710
<33-7,ARGUELLO>是的  但大卫告诉我  他闯入后
<33-7,ARGUELLO>Yes, but while he was there, Dave told me

826
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:21,820
<33-7,ARGUELLO>不小心发现了你的秘密小账户
<33-7,ARGUELLO>he stumbled across your little secret account.

827
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:24,960
<33-7,ARGUELLO>我不知道你在说什么
<33-7,ARGUELLO>Uh, I have no idea what you're talking about.

828
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,480
<33-8,STEPHEN>我的热狗已经做好了  我
<33-8,STEPHEN>And, uh, my hot dog's waiting, so --

829
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,420
<33-1,ARGUELLO>大卫是个谨慎的人  里德先生
<33-1,ARGUELLO>Dave was a cautious man, Mr. Reed.

830
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:31,320
<33-9,ARGUELLO>他拿到了关于那个账户的证据
<33-9,ARGUELLO>He took proof of the account --

831
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:33,070
<33-9,ARGUELLO>他把证据存在了一个闪存盘中
<33-9,ARGUELLO>proof that he left on a thumb drive

832
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:35,580
<33-9,ARGUELLO>并在被害之前将其放在我教堂祭坛的
<33-9,ARGUELLO>on the altar of my church behind the chalice

833
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,650
<33-9,ARGUELLO>圣餐杯后面
<33-9,ARGUELLO>before he was killed.

834
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:41,330
<33-9,ARGUELLO>我把这个消息当作礼物送给你
<33-9,ARGUELLO>I give you this information as a gift.

835
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:44,950
<33-9,ARGUELLO>而作为答谢  如果你能把教堂的欠款
<33-9,ARGUELLO>If you were to make the church's debt disappear,

836
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,770
<33-9,ARGUELLO>一笔勾销的话
<33-9,ARGUELLO>as a token of appreciation,

837
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:51,180
<33-9,ARGUELLO>主会感激你的
<33-9,ARGUELLO>well, the lord would be grateful.

838
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:52,310
<33-9,ARGUELLO>这个嘛
<33-9,ARGUELLO>Well...

839
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:55,080
<33-10,STEPHEN>正如我所说的  神父
<33-10,STEPHEN>Like I said... Father...

840
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:58,090
<33-10,STEPHEN>我完全不知道你在说什么
<33-10,STEPHEN>I got no clue what you're talking about.

841
00:33:58,530 --> 00:33:59,910
<33-10,STEPHEN>再也别来找我了
<33-10,STEPHEN>Don't ever come see me again.

842
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,450
<33-11,ARGUELLO>愿上帝保佑你  我的孩子
<33-11,ARGUELLO>Bless you, my child.

843
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,440
<34-1,RYAN>成功了吗
<34-1,RYAN>Think it worked?

844
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,680
<34-2,CASTLE>当然
<34-2,CASTLE>Of course it worked.

845
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:06,800
<34-3,ESPOSITO>今晚就知道成不成功了
<34-3,ESPOSITO>We'll know tonight.

846
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,750
<34-4,CASTLE>肯定会成功
<34-4,CASTLE>That it worked.

847
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:50,010
<34-4,CASTLE>好吧
<34-4,CASTLE>All right.

848
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:51,960
<35-1,CASTLE>你知道该怎么做
<35-1,CASTLE>You know what to do.

849
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,360
<35-2,ALEXIS>你确定吗
<35-2,ALEXIS>Are you sure about this?

850
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:55,130
<35-3,CASTLE>玩大点要不就干脆回家待着
<35-3,CASTLE>Go big or go home,

851
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:58,640
<35-3,CASTLE>只不过这一次  监狱就是家了
<35-3,CASTLE>except...in this case, home might be jail.

852
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:17,350
<35-4,ESPOSITO>是他吗
<35-4,ESPOSITO>Is that him?

853
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:18,920
<35-5,RYAN>不知道
<35-5,RYAN>I don't know.

854
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:39,630
<35-6,ESPOSITO>肯定是他
<35-6,ESPOSITO>It's got to be him.

855
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,700
<35-9,ESPOSITO>不许动  纽约警局  站住  里德
<35-9,ESPOSITO>Don't move! NYPD! Stop! Reed!

856
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:51,760
<35-10,CASTLE>闪存盘没了
<35-10,CASTLE>It's gone.

857
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:55,660
<35-10,CASTLE>该死的
<35-10,CASTLE>Damn it!

858
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:57,480
<35-11,ESPOSITO>-他跑哪去了  -我们搞砸了
<35-11,ESPOSITO>- Where'd he go? - We're screwed.

859
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,640
<35-12,RYAN>整个妨碍执法指控都建立在
<35-12,RYAN>Catching him with that empty thumb drive

860
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,270
<35-12,RYAN>抓到他拿着那个空白的闪存盘上
<35-12,RYAN>was our whole conspiracy charge.

861
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:01,470
<35-13,ALEXIS>成功了吗
<35-13,ALEXIS>Did it work?

862
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,550
<35-14,ESPOSITO>什么成功了吗
<35-14,ESPOSITO>Did what work?

863
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:06,330
<35-15,ESPOSITO>是你把灯给关了吗
<35-15,ESPOSITO>Are you the one that turned the lights out?

864
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:08,210
<35-16,CASTLE>是我  我让她去关的
<35-16,CASTLE>I-I told her to do that.

865
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:10,560
<35-17,RYAN>你为什么要干这种事
<35-17,RYAN>Why in the hell would you do that?

866
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,010
<35-18,CASTLE>我认为我们的《午夜狂奔》策略
<35-18,CASTLE>Well, I thought our "Midnight Run" stratagem

867
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:13,090
<35-18,CASTLE>需要一点小转折
<35-18,CASTLE>needed a little twist.

868
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:14,640
<35-18,CASTLE>相信我  伙计们  这次成功的话
<35-18,CASTLE>Trust me, guys -- if this works,

869
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,630
<35-18,CASTLE>我们控告他的就不只是妨碍司法公正了
<35-18,CASTLE>we're gonna have him on a whole lot more than just obstruction.

870
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:18,620
<35-19,ESPOSITO>要是不成功呢
<35-19,ESPOSITO>What if it doesn't?

871
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:48,170
<36-1,CASTLE>我是理查德·卡塞尔  私家侦探
<36-1,CASTLE>Hi. I'm Richard Castle, private investigator.

872
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,760
<36-1,CASTLE>你把这个闪存盘
<36-1,CASTLE>The moment you plugged this thumb drive

873
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,400
<36-1,CASTLE>插入电脑的一瞬间
<36-1,CASTLE>into your computer,

874
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,920
<36-1,CASTLE>它就在你的系统上植入了病毒
<36-1,CASTLE>it injected a virus into your system.

875
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,840
<36-1,CASTLE>现在那个病毒已经搜索了你的按键历史
<36-1,CASTLE>By now, that virus has searched your keystroke history

876
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:00,020
<36-1,CASTLE>并且查出你把贿赂资金藏到了哪里
<36-1,CASTLE>and found where you've moved your hidden slush fund.

877
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,760
<36-1,CASTLE>这就是电脑版的爆炸染料包
<36-1,CASTLE>It's the computer equivalent of an exploding dye pack.

879
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:14,780
<36-2,CASTLE>看来我们还可以再给你加一条
<36-2,CASTLE>So, I guess we can add destruction of city property

880
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:15,880
<36-2,CASTLE>破坏公共财产的罪名
<36-2,CASTLE>to those charges.

881
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:21,180
<36-2,CASTLE>我没杀他
<36-2,CASTLE>I didn't kill him.

882
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,930
<37-1,STEPHEN>我图什么呢  他是个骗子
<37-1,STEPHEN>Why would I? He was a liar.

883
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:26,120
<37-1,STEPHEN>再说  我有不在场证明
<37-1,STEPHEN>Plus, I have an alibi.

884
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:28,960
<37-2,RYAN>哦  让我猜猜  你一个人在家睡觉吗
<37-2,RYAN>Oh, let me guess -- you were home, alone, asleep?

885
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:32,970
<37-3,STEPHEN>不  我在和你们的上司  警察局长玩扑克
<37-3,STEPHEN>No, I was out playing poker with your boss, the police commissioner.

886
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:35,680
<37-3,STEPHEN>这说明你们的凶手还逍遥法外
<37-3,STEPHEN>Which means your killer's still out there.

887
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:37,420
<38-1,BECKETT>所以  我们现在都知道什么
<38-1,BECKETT>So, what do we know?

888
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:40,420
<38-2,RYAN>大卫·约翰逊  病态撒谎者
<38-2,RYAN>Dave Johnson -- he was a pathological liar

889
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:42,650
<38-2,RYAN>偶然发现一笔秘密的贿赂基金
<38-2,RYAN>who stumbled upon a secret slush fund

890
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,250
<38-2,RYAN>然后决定揭发这件事
<38-2,RYAN>and then decided to expose it.

891
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:46,630
<38-3,ESPOSITO>而所有与此相关的人都有不在场证明
<38-3,ESPOSITO>And everyone connected to that alibi'd out.

892
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:48,110
<38-4,BECKETT>所以我们毫无进展
<38-4,BECKETT>So we've got nothing?

893
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:52,420
<38-5,CASTLE>不  我们可以肯定大卫是因为说谎被杀的
<38-5,CASTLE>No. We can safely assume that Dave was killed over a lie.

894
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,190
<38-6,BECKETT>那么是哪个谎
<38-6,BECKETT>Which lie, then?

895
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:57,650
<38-7,CASTLE>如果是我来写  我会始终围绕一个主题
<38-7,CASTLE>Well, if I was writing this, I would fall back on a theme.

896
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:00,830
<38-7,CASTLE>谎言是对信任的背叛
<38-7,CASTLE>A lie is a betrayal of trust.

897
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:07,330
<38-8,CASTLE>而最严重的背叛  莫过于婚姻中的谎言了
<38-8,CASTLE>And there is no greater betrayal... than a lie in a marriage.

898
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:09,800
<38-9,BECKETT>好吧  也许是这样
<38-9,BECKETT>Yeah, well, that might be,

899
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,970
<38-9,BECKETT>但温迪以为大卫是P·J·莫菲特
<38-9,BECKETT>but Wendy thought that Dave was P.J. Moffet.

900
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:14,770
<38-10,CASTLE>如果她发现他不是呢
<38-10,CASTLE>What if she found out he wasn't?

901
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:18,610
<39-1,WENDY>你们完全搞错了  我没杀大卫
<39-1,WENDY>You have this all wrong. I didn't kill Dave.

902
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,530
<39-2,BECKETT>我们在你的车上找到了彩色玻璃的碎片
<39-2,BECKETT>We found fragments of stained glass in your car.

903
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:24,330
<39-2,BECKETT>与教堂碎掉的玻璃窗相匹配
<39-2,BECKETT>It matches the broken glass found in the church.

904
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,860
<39-3,WENDY>我只是因为大卫说他是个名作家才嫁给他的
<39-3,WENDY>I only married Dave because he told me he was a famous author.

905
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:35,700
<39-3,WENDY>我  我只是觉得这样我就能过上奢侈的生活
<39-3,WENDY>I-I just -- I thought I was gonna be living in luxury.

906
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:39,560
<39-3,WENDY>但是他坚持过穷日子
<39-3,WENDY>And -- and he insisted that we live in poverty,

907
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:41,820
<39-3,WENDY>即使他身家巨万
<39-3,WENDY>even though he had millions.

908
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,030
<39-4,CASTLE>可惜  他在说谎
<39-4,CASTLE>Only, he was lying.

909
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:44,860
<39-4,CASTLE>而你发现了这点
<39-4,CASTLE>And you found out.

910
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:49,200
<39-5,BECKETT>我不明白的是  你为什么要杀了他
<39-5,BECKETT>You know, what I don't understand is, why would you kill him?

911
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,560
<39-5,BECKETT>你为什么不离婚算了
<39-5,BECKETT>Why didn't you just divorce the guy?

912
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:56,050
<39-6,WENDY>因为他要为我的损失  付出代价
<39-6,WENDY>Because he had to pay. For what he cost me.

913
00:38:56,740 --> 00:39:00,350
<39-6,WENDY>我本来能嫁给拿骚县的地毯大亨本·沙皮罗
<39-6,WENDY>I could have married Ben Shapiro, the carpet king of Nassau county.

914
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:07,400
<39-6,WENDY>然而谁成想  我嫁给一个毁了我生活的骗子
<39-6,WENDY>But instead, I married a liar who ruined my life.

915
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:12,860
<39-7,BECKETT>温迪·约翰逊  你因谋杀
<39-7,BECKETT>Wendy Johnson, you are under arrest

916
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:14,530
<39-7,BECKETT>你丈夫而被捕
<39-7,BECKETT>for the murder of your husband.

917
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,860
<39-8,WENDY>等等  等一下
<39-8,WENDY>Wait. Wait!

918
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:23,380
<39-9,CASTLE>这几天  你就会收到发票

<40-4,ESPOSITIO>我不需要你的施舍
<40-4,ESPOSITIO>I don't need your charity.

926
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:45,320
<40-5,RYAN>这不是施舍
<40-5,RYAN>It's not charity.

<40-7,BECKETT>Did it ever occur to you that your captain

931
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:01,690
<40-7,BECKETT>可以动用点关系给你们每人一个考位吗
<40-7,BECKETT>could pull some strings and get you both a slot?

<41-1,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<41-1,BECKETT>Castle?

00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:36,290
<41-2,CASTLE>别紧张  没什么别的意思
<41-2,CASTLE>Relax. Doesn't mean anything.

941
00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:39,000
<41-2,CASTLE>这不过是一杯庆祝
<41-2,CASTLE>It's just a little congratulatory coffee

942
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:40,670
<41-2,CASTLE>解决棘手案子的咖啡
<41-2,CASTLE>after solving a tough case.

943
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:58,310
<41-3,BECKETT>我总是没办法泡的像你一样好喝
<41-3,BECKETT>I can never make it like you.

944
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,850
<41-3,BECKETT>虽然你教过我怎么做
<41-3,BECKETT>Even though you taught me how.

945
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:02,190
<41-4,CASTLE>那是因为我撒谎了
<41-4,CASTLE>That's 'cause I lied.

946
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:09,940
<41-5,CASTLE>有一味很特殊的原料  我隐瞒了
<41-5,CASTLE>There's a, uh... special ingredient. I kept it a secret.

947
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:11,560
<41-5,CASTLE>真的
<41-5,CASTLE>Really?

948
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:13,410
<41-6,BECKETT>是什么
<41-6,BECKETT>What is it?

949
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:14,930
<41-7,CASTLE>好吧  如果我现在告诉你
<41-7,CASTLE>Well, now, if I told you that,

950
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,570
<41-7,CASTLE>你也许就不再需要我了
<41-7,CASTLE>you might not need me anymore.

951
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,200
<41-9,CASTLE>那就不要告诉我
<41-9,CASTLE>Then don't tell me.

952
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,280
<41-8,BECKETT>既然我们彼此坦诚
<41-8,BECKETT>And since we're being honest,

953
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,850
<41-8,BECKETT>有些事我得告诉你
<41-8,BECKETT>there's something that I have to tell you.

954
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:32,270
<41-8,BECKETT>我讨厌莫菲特的书
<41-8,BECKETT>I hated Moffet's book.

955
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:33,240
<41-8,BECKETT>什么  什
<41-8,BECKETT>What?! Wha--

956
00:41:35,850 --> 00:41:36,750
<41-9,CASTLE>你以前为什么不告诉我
<41-9,CASTLE>Why didn't you tell me?

957
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:38,700
<41-10,BECKETT>因为那是你在刚开始和我约会的时候送给我的
<41-10,BECKETT>Because you gave it to me when we first started dating,

958
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:39,940
<41-10,BECKETT>我知道那对你来说很重要
<41-10,BECKETT>and I knew it was important to you,

959
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:42,490
<41-10,BECKETT>所以  我撒谎了
<41-10,BECKETT>So...I lied.

960
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:50,680
<41-11,BECKETT>我很抱歉  我得接这个电话
<41-11,BECKETT>I'm sorry. I have to get this.

961
00:41:58,370 --> 00:41:59,220
<41-12,CASTLE>晚安
<41-12,CASTLE>Have a good night.

962
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,190
<41-13,BECKETT>你也是
<41-13,BECKETT>You too.

963
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:12,930
<41-14,BECKETT>维克拉姆
<41-14,BECKETT>Vikram. Hey.

964
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,060
<41-14,BECKETT>你拿到瓦肯·西蒙斯案子里
<41-14,BECKETT>Did you get the test results on the heroin

965
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:16,400
<41-14,BECKETT>海洛因的化验结果了吗
<41-14,BECKETT>from the Vulcan Simmons case?

966
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:20,230
<41-14,BECKETT>很好
<41-14,BECKETT>Good.

967
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,080
<41-14,BECKETT>现在我们可以动手了
<41-14,BECKETT>Now we can get to work.
