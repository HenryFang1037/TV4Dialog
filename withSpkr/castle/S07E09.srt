26
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,760
<3-3,BECKETT>死者可不是"没事"
<3-3,BECKETT>Which can't be said for our dead guy.

31
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:41,650
<4-3,ESPOSITO>只说穿了深色外衣
<4-3,ESPOSITO>Just a figure in a dark coat.

32
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:42,780
<4-3,ESPOSITO>至于被害人

<4-4,CASTLE>兰斯·德鲁卡

51
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,880
<4-13,CASTLE>但兰斯住在洛杉矶
<4-13,CASTLE>But... but Lance lived in l.A.

52
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,330
<4-13,CASTLE>不知道他怎么跑这儿来了
<4-13,CASTLE>I wonder what he was doing in town.

53
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:22,350
<4-14,BECKETT>还出现在这家剧院
<4-14,BECKETT>And at this theater.

54

<4-14,BECKETT>他来看自己的老电影吗

<4-16,LANIE PARISH>他身体和手上都有生前留下的瘀伤
<4-16,LANIE PARISH>There is perimortem bruising on his hands and torso.

58
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,770
<4-16,LANIE PARISH>卡塞尔的偶像肯定跟人打架了
<4-16,LANIE PARISH>Castle's idol must have gotten into a fight

59
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:34,360
<4-16,LANIE PARISH>就在死前不久
<4-16,LANIE PARISH>not too long before he died.

60
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,720
<4-16,LANIE PARISH>死因显然是勒毙
<4-16,LANIE PARISH>Cause of death is clearly strangulation by ligature.

61
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,390
<4-17,BECKETT>看来凶器很窄
<4-17,BECKETT>A narrow ligature, from the looks of it.

62
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:42,790
<4-18,RYAN>是绑在两根木钉上的细线留下的吗
<4-18,RYAN>Made by a thin wire tied to two wooden dowels?

<4-19,BECKETT>绞喉  谁会用这东西啊
<4-19,BECKETT>A garrote. Who would use one of those?

65

<4-20,ESPOSITO>特种部队想安静杀人时会用
<4-20,ESPOSITO>Special forces will sometimes when you want to kill quietly.

66
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:49,370
<4-21,CASTLE>更大的问题是
<4-21,CASTLE>Well, the bigger question is

67
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,200
<4-21,CASTLE>凶手怎么能制住兰斯·德鲁卡
<4-21,CASTLE>how'd they get the drop on Lance Delorca?

<4-22,RYAN>兰斯扮演动作片英雄  卡塞尔
<4-22,RYAN>Uh, Lance played an action hero, Castle.

69
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:54,090
<4-22,RYAN>他本人并不一定是好身手
<4-22,RYAN>It doesn't mean he was one.

70
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,140
<4-23,CASTLE>恰恰相反  我的朋友
<4-23,CASTLE>Au contraire, mon frere.

73
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,400
<4-23,CASTLE>负责秘密行动  此人是致命武器
<4-23,CASTLE>He was black ops. This man was a lethal weapon.

74
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,840
<4-24,BECKETT>嗯  看来还不够致命
<4-24,BECKETT>Yeah, well, not lethal enough.

75
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,970
<4-24,BECKETT>让鉴证组查凶器找指纹
<4-24,BECKETT>Have C.S.U. take a look at the murder weapon for prints.

<5-25,BECKETT>我找到了她
<5-25,BECKETT>I tracked her down.

120
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:46,640
<5-25,BECKETT>她就在纽约  在拍电影
<5-25,BECKETT>She's in New York, she's shooting a film,

121
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,120
<5-25,BECKETT>她正在赶来
<5-25,BECKETT>and she's on her way in now.

122
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,260
<5-26,CASTLE>她要过来
<5-26,CASTLE>She's coming here?!

123
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,290
<5-26,CASTLE>我在墙上挂过她的海报  挂了...
<5-26,CASTLE>I had her poster on my wall for like...

124
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,200
<5-26,CASTLE>没多久
<5-26,CASTLE>...for about a minute.

125
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,450
<5-28,BECKETT>你这次还是别参与了  卡塞尔
<5-28,BECKETT>You know, maybe you should sit this one out, Castle.

126
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,040
<6-1,KAT KINGSLEY>感觉好不真实  简直...
<6-1,KAT KINGSLEY>This doesn't seem real, like it's just a...

127
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:12,020
<6-1,KAT KINGSLEY>像场噩梦
<6-1,KAT KINGSLEY>a bad dream.

128
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:13,450
<6-2,BECKETT>金斯利女士  你知道有谁
<6-2,BECKETT>Ms. Kingsley, do you know of anyone

129
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:15,080
<6-2,BECKETT>会想伤害你丈夫吗
<6-2,BECKETT>that would have wanted to harm your husband?

130
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,240
<6-3,KAT>没有
<6-3,KAT>No. Of course not.

131
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,280
<6-4,BECKETT>你最后跟他通话是什么时候
<6-4,BECKETT>And when was the last time you talked to him?

132
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,480
<6-5,KAT>一周前
<6-5,KAT>It was a week ago.

133
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,800
<6-5,KAT>-我们想一起吃饭  最终没吃成  -一周
<6-5,KAT>- We tried to meet for lunch, but it never worked out. - A week ago?

134
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,610
<6-6,BECKETT>你们俩没住一起吗
<6-6,BECKETT>The two of you weren't staying together?

135
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:27,310
<6-7,KAT>我们在离婚
<6-7,KAT>We were getting a divorce.

136
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,670
<6-7,KAT>我陪伴兰斯度过了癌症治疗
<6-7,KAT>I saw Lance - through his cancer treatment,

137
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:32,870
<6-7,KAT>但是经历了这么多年的起起伏伏
<6-7,KAT>but after all the years, the high, the lows,

138
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,250
<6-7,KAT>我们之间没感情了
<6-7,KAT>neither of us had anything left.

139
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,730
<6-7,KAT>我们是和平分手的
<6-7,KAT>I mean, it was all amicable.

140
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,590
<6-8,BECKETT>你知道他来纽约做什么吗
<6-8,BECKETT>Do you know what he was doing in town?

141
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,020
<6-9,KAT>他在跟老搭档
<6-9,KAT>He was shooting a film

142
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,280
<6-9,KAT>布鲁克·哈蒙拍摄电影
<6-9,KAT>with his old partner, Brock Harmon.

143
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:42,160
<6-10,BECKETT>什么电影
<6-10,BECKETT>What film?

144

<6-11,KAT>《不倒硬汉》的最新续集

145
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,560
<6-11,KAT>布鲁克执导
<6-11,KAT>Brock's directing.

146
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,760
<6-11,KAT>实际上  兰斯跟他住一起
<6-11,KAT>In fact, Lance was staying with him.

147
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,240
<6-11,KAT>如果出了什么问题  布鲁克会知道的
<6-11,KAT>So if there was trouble, Brock would know about it.

148
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,250
<6-11,KAT>上上上
<6-11,KAT>Go, go, go!

149
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,980
<7-1,BECKETT>真是太俗了
<7-1,BECKETT>This is so cheesy.

150
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:07,230
<7-2,CASTLE>她说的"俗"意思是"棒极了"
<7-2,CASTLE>And by "Cheesy," she means "Amazing."

151
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,290
<7-3,CASTLE>拜托  瞧瞧电影的奇迹
<7-3,CASTLE>Come on. Behold the miracle of cinema.

152
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:12,880
<7-4,BECKETT>真正的奇迹是那种女孩
<7-4,BECKETT>The real miracle is how a girl like that

153
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,910
<7-4,BECKETT>居然跟年龄大到足够

<7-5,CASTLE>她可以把那些人打得落花流水
<7-5,CASTLE>She could beat all those guys to a pulp.

157
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:22,150
<7-6,BECKETT>那人是谁
<7-6,BECKETT>Who's that guy?

158

<7-8,BECKETT>我不知道  卡塞尔
<7-8,BECKETT>I don't know, Castle.

163
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:31,440
<7-8,BECKETT>也许我就喜欢老派的人
<7-8,BECKETT>Maybe I just like the old-school guys, you know?

164
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,420
<7-8,BECKETT>比如伊斯特伍德  布朗森  麦奎因

<7-18,BROCK>我希望你还知道她的珠宝首饰
<7-18,BROCK>And her jewelry line, too, I hope.

185
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:26,070
<7-18,BROCK>她刚发布了春季系列  很赞
<7-18,BROCK>She just launched a spring collection -- - Nice.

186
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:29,200
<7-19,CASTLE>你在《铁胆硬汉》中扮演大佬的手下
<7-19,CASTLE>You were just outstanding as El Jéfe's Henchwoman

187
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,520
<7-19,CASTLE>太精彩了  那真是...
<7-19,CASTLE>in "Hard Kill." That was -- ooh.

188
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,150
<7-20,NAOMI>你真贴心
<7-20,NAOMI>Oh, that is so sweet.

189
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,420
<7-20,NAOMI>我的回旋踢很厉害  但我不是个很好的演员
<7-20,NAOMI>I had a mean roundhouse kick, but I wasn't much of an actor.

190
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,270
<7-21,BROCK>这可没拦住我
<7-21,BROCK>Well, it never stopped me.

191
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,720
<7-21,BROCK>这是我儿子特雷
<7-21,BROCK>Oh, uh, this is my son, Trey.

192
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,660
<7-22,TREY>幸会
<7-22,TREY>Good to meet you.

193
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:44,000
<7-23,BECKETT>哈蒙先生  我们能私下聊聊吗
<7-23,BECKETT>Uh, Mr. Harmon, could we speak privately?

194
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,280
<7-24,BROCK>当然啦
<7-24,BROCK>Oh. Sure.

195
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:50,130
<8-1,BROCK>一个骨髓捐献者捐献的骨髓
<8-1,BROCK>Transplant from a bone-marrow donor,

196
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,110
<8-1,BROCK>让兰斯进入了缓解期  救了他的命
<8-1,BROCK>that's what put Lance in remission, saved his life.

197
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:54,700
<8-1,BROCK>他知道他得到了第二次机会
<8-1,BROCK>He knew he'd been given a second chance.

198
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,720
<8-1,BROCK>他戒酒了  洗心革面
<8-1,BROCK>He got sober, cleaned up his act.

199
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,420
<8-1,BROCK>所以我让他参演电影
<8-1,BROCK>That's why I gave him a part in the movie.

200
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,790
<8-1,BROCK>这本可成为他的东山再起之作
<8-1,BROCK>This could have been his big comeback.

201
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:03,720
<8-2,BECKETT>我们听说他跟你住在一起
<8-2,BECKETT>So, we understand that he was staying with you.

202
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:05,390
<8-2,BECKETT>他看起来什么样子
<8-2,BECKETT>How did he seem?

203
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:08,450
<8-3,BROCK>挺安静的  我甚至会说是守口如瓶
<8-3,BROCK>Quiet. Secretive, I'd even say.

204
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,630
<8-3,BROCK>兰斯一直都沉默寡言
<8-3,BROCK>Lance was always a man of few words,

205
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:13,320
<8-3,BROCK>但这次他说得更少
<8-3,BROCK>but even fewer this time out.

206
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:15,430
<8-4,CASTLE>你知道他昨晚11点半在下东区
<8-4,CASTLE>Any idea what he was doing on the Lower East Side

207
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,940
<8-4,CASTLE>做什么吗
<8-4,CASTLE>last night at 11:30?

208
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,990
<8-5,BROCK>我都不知道他来了市里
<8-5,BROCK>I didn't even know he was in town.

209
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:20,120
<8-6,CASTLE>你说了他跟你住一起
<8-6,CASTLE>You said he was staying with you.

210
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,390
<8-7,BROCK>是啊  兰斯上周拍完了
<8-7,BROCK>Right. Lance wrapped last week.

211
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:24,010
<8-7,BROCK>别人说他直接
<8-7,BROCK>I was told transportation took him

212
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:25,810
<8-7,BROCK>从片场去了机场
<8-7,BROCK>straight from the set to the airport.

213
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:27,840
<8-8,BECKETT>好吧  我的警探需要跟司机谈谈
<8-8,BECKETT>Okay, well, my detectives will need to speak with the driver,

214
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,790
<8-8,BECKETT>还有兰斯认识的所有人
<8-8,BECKETT>along with anyone else that Lance knew.

215
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:31,480
<8-9,BROCK>当然啦
<8-9,BROCK>Of course. Um...

216
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,820
<8-10,BROCK>到底发生了什么事  他怎么死的
<8-10,BROCK>What exactly happened? How did he die?

217
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:40,080
<8-11,BECKETT>他是被绞喉勒死的
<8-11,BECKETT>Um, he was strangled...with a garrote.

218
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:43,780
<8-12,CASTLE>那对你有什么含义吗
<8-12,CASTLE>Does that mean something to you?

219
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,910
<8-13,BROCK>你们知道兰斯是西情局的人对吧
<8-13,BROCK>You know Lance was CNI, right?

220
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,460
<8-14,BECKETT>西班牙情报局
<8-14,BECKETT>Spanish Intelligence.

221
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:51,110
<8-14,BECKETT>-那跟他的谋杀有何关系  -关系大了去了
<8-14,BECKETT>- What does that have to do with his murder? - Everything.

222
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,030
<8-15,BROCK>他是西情局的杀手  那是他的标志手法
<8-15,BROCK>He was a CNI assassin. That was his signature.

223
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,930
<8-15,BROCK>他用绞喉杀人
<8-15,BROCK>He killed people with a garrote.

224
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:00,260
<9-1,CASTLE>所以别人用绞喉来杀他
<9-1,CASTLE>Which is why it was used to kill him.

225
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,900
<9-1,CASTLE>兰斯被谋杀了  因为他是西班牙版的杰森·伯恩
<9-1,CASTLE>Lance was murdered because he's the Spanish Jason Bourne.

226
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:03,540
<9-2,BECKETT>为什么  卡塞尔
<9-2,BECKETT>Why, Castle?

227
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,230
<9-2,BECKETT>因为穿着和服的B级动作片明星这样说吗
<9-2,BECKETT>Because a "B" action-movie star in a kimono said so?

228
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:07,910
<9-3,CASTLE>因为这合情合理
<9-3,CASTLE>Because it makes sense.

229
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,680
<9-3,CASTLE>兰斯借鉴自己作为无情的
<9-3,CASTLE>Lance was drawing on his experience

230
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,700
<9-3,CASTLE>西情局特工的经验  来扮演动作英雄
<9-3,CASTLE>as a ruthless CNI operative to play action heroes.

231
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,590
<9-3,CASTLE>但他神秘的过去找上了他
<9-3,CASTLE>But his shadowy past caught up with him.

232
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:15,640
<9-3,CASTLE>也许这是报复
<9-3,CASTLE>Maybe it was revenge

233
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,050
<9-3,CASTLE>某人因为他过去执行的暗杀
<9-3,CASTLE>for a-a hit he did back in the day --

234
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,650
<9-3,CASTLE>以彼之道  还施彼身
<9-3,CASTLE>Kill him the way he killed.

235
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:22,810
<9-4,BECKETT>卡塞尔  他30年前就离开了西情局
<9-4,BECKETT>Castle, he left CNI 30 years ago.

236
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:25,020
<9-4,BECKETT>为什么他的过去现在找上了他
<9-4,BECKETT>Why would his past catch up to him now?

237
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:28,330
<9-5,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>关于西情局的事  卡塞尔先生可能说对了
<9-5,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>Mr. Castle might just be right about CNI.

238
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:30,560
<9-6,CASTLE>我怎么对了
<9-6,CASTLE>Aha. How -- how am I right?

239
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,290
<9-7,GATES>埃斯波西托和莱恩去问讯片场的人了
<9-7,GATES>Esposito and Ryan are off interviewing folks on the set.

240
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:35,460
<9-7,GATES>但他们离开之前  他们有所发现
<9-7,GATES>But before they left, they got onto something.

241
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:38,270
<9-7,GATES>他们调出了兰斯的通话记录  他死的那天
<9-7,GATES>They pulled Lance's phone records, and the day he died,

242
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:40,680
<9-7,GATES>给西班牙的国际刑警组织打了电话
<9-7,GATES>He made a phone call to interpol in Spain,

243
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,520
<9-7,GATES>打给了恩里克·戈麦斯的办公室
<9-7,GATES>to the office of one Enrique Gomez.

244
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:45,580
<9-8,BECKETT>戈麦斯和西情局有什么关系
<9-8,BECKETT>What does Gomez have to do with CNI?

245
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:48,370
<9-9,GATES>根据他的简历  戈麦斯曾和兰斯·德鲁卡
<9-9,GATES>According to his bio, Gomez used to work there

246
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:50,960
<9-9,GATES>同时在西情局工作
<9-9,GATES>at the same time Lance Delorca did.

247
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:53,930
<9-10,CASTLE>兰斯联系了另一名前特工
<9-10,CASTLE>So Lance reaches out to another ex-agent,

248
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:55,490
<9-10,CASTLE>现在被绞喉杀害了
<9-10,CASTLE>and he's killed with a garrote?

249
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,390
<9-10,CASTLE>记住我的话
<9-10,CASTLE>Mark my words...

250
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,470
<9-10,CASTLE>这起案子会带领我们走进
<9-10,CASTLE>...This case is gonna lead us into a labyrinthian world

251
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:02,880
<9-10,CASTLE>欺骗  邪恶和国际间谍活动的迷宫世界
<9-10,CASTLE>of deceit, villainy, and international espionage.

252
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,890
<9-10,CASTLE>这比他的电影都还棒
<9-10,CASTLE>This is better than one of his movies.

253
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,960
<9-11,BECKETT>看过了拍摄现场  这是必须的
<9-11,BECKETT>After what I saw, it'd have to be.

263
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,890
<10-1,GATES>好  谢谢
<10-1,GATES>Yeah. Thanks.

264
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:20,690
<10-1,GATES>最新情况
<10-1,GATES>Update.

265
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:22,510
<10-1,GATES>我联系了国际刑警组织  来追踪
<10-1,GATES>I contacted interpol to track down

266
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,750
<10-1,GATES>兰斯联系的那个人  恩里克·戈麦斯
<10-1,GATES>that guy Lance called, Enrique Gomez.

267
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,990
<10-1,GATES>原来戈麦斯现在在纽约
<10-1,GATES>Well, it turns out gomez is here in New York

268
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,310
<10-1,GATES>他来参加联合国会议
<10-1,GATES>for a meeting at the U.N.

269
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,890
<10-2,BECKETT>他昨晚11点半在哪
<10-2,BECKETT>Where was he last night at 11:30?

270
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:31,860
<10-3,GATES>从马德里飞来的夜间航班上
<10-3,GATES>On a red-eye in from Madrid.

271
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,110
<10-3,GATES>他今天一大早到的
<10-3,GATES>He arrived early this morning,

272
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,050
<10-3,GATES>所以他不是凶手
<10-3,GATES>so he's not our killer.

273
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,720
<10-3,GATES>但是国际刑警组织会让他过来接受问讯
<10-3,GATES>But Interpol will send him over here for an interview.

274
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,330
<10-3,GATES>他也许对谋杀案有自己的看法
<10-3,GATES>He might have insight on the murder.

275
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,420
<10-4,BECKETT>我跟西情局谈过了
<10-4,BECKETT>Well, I talked to CNI

276
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,080
<10-4,BECKETT>问了他们关于兰斯在任时的情况
<10-4,BECKETT>to ask them about Lance's time there,

277
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,730
<10-4,BECKETT>关于他涉及的任务
<10-4,BECKETT>about missions that he was involved in,

278
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:45,440
<10-4,BECKETT>他可能有的敌人  可他们总是含糊其辞
<10-4,BECKETT>Enemies that he might have had, and they are stone-walling me.

279
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,400
<10-5,GATES>西情局这样的情报机构
<10-5,GATES>Intelligence agencies like CNI

280
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,100
<10-5,GATES>肯定要避免透漏他们内部员工的信息
<10-5,GATES>avoid disclosing information on their employees.

281
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,750
<10-5,GATES>不过我在国务院还有点关系
<10-5,GATES>But I do have contacts in the state department.

282
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,250
<10-5,GATES>-我去问问  -好
<10-5,GATES>- Let me just ask around. - Great.

283
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,480
<10-6,BECKETT>我也在联系我在华盛顿的朋友了
<10-6,BECKETT>I've reached out to my guys in Washington, as well.

284
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,050
<11-1,RYAN>贝克特  片场那边有发现
<11-1,RYAN>Hey, Beckett. I think we got something from that movie set.

285
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:02,500
<11-2,ESPOSITO>我们问过送兰斯去机场的司机了
<11-2,ESPOSITO>We talked to the driver who took Lance to the airport.

286
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,410
<11-3,RYAN>只是他根本没去机场
<11-3,RYAN>Only, that's not what he did.

287
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:05,970
<11-3,RYAN>兰斯其实在布鲁姆街
<11-3,RYAN>Lance asked the driver to drop him off

288
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:07,700
<11-3,RYAN>一个廉价旅馆下了车
<11-3,RYAN>at some seedy hotel on Broome Street.

289
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,430
<11-4,ESPOSITO>他不希望任何人知道
<11-4,ESPOSITO>And he didn't want anybody to know about it.

290
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:10,920
<11-4,ESPOSITO>他付了司机100块
<11-4,ESPOSITO>He paid the driver 100 bucks to lie

291
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,840
<11-4,ESPOSITO>让他撒谎说把兰斯送到了肯尼迪机场
<11-4,ESPOSITO>and say he dropped Lance off at JFK.

292
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:14,140
<11-5,BECKETT>他去那旅馆干什么
<11-5,BECKETT>Why would he go to this hotel?

293
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,030
<11-6,RYAN>这就是让人不解的地方了
<11-6,RYAN>Well, that's where it gets weird.

294
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,340
<11-6,RYAN>我们派去调查的人说
<11-6,RYAN>The unis we sent to canvass

295
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,530
<11-6,RYAN>兰斯在那租了个房间  租期一周
<11-6,RYAN>said that Lance had rented a room there for the past week.

296
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:21,090
<11-7,ESPOSITO>用的名字是瑞克·克鲁斯
<11-7,ESPOSITO>Under the name Rico Cruz,

297
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:22,560
<11-7,ESPOSITO>他在《铁胆硬汉》中的角色名
<11-7,ESPOSITO>his character from "Hard kill."

298
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,810
<11-8,BECKETT>好吧
<11-8,BECKETT>Um...Okay.

299
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:25,970
<11-8,BECKETT>让他们查查旅馆的监控录像
<11-8,BECKETT>Have unis check - for security video at the hotel,

300
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:27,130
<11-8,BECKETT>咱们去他房间
<11-8,BECKETT>And, uh, let's round up

301
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:29,130
<11-8,BECKETT>收集他的个人物品
<11-8,BECKETT>any of Lance's personal effects from his room.

302
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:29,870
<11-8,BECKETT>好
<11-8,BECKETT>Yeah.

303
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:32,320
<11-8,BECKETT>-谢了  -不客气
<11-8,BECKETT>- Thanks, l.T. - Yeah.

304
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,240
<12-1,ESPOSITO>我不明白
<12-1,ESPOSITO>I-I don't understand.

305
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,450
<12-2,RYAN>兰斯为什么要离开布鲁克·哈蒙在第五大道的寓所
<12-2,RYAN>Why would Lance leave Brock Harmon's fifth avenue digs

306
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:38,100
<12-2,RYAN>跑去住廉价旅馆
<12-2,RYAN>to go stay in a flophouse?

307
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,510
<12-3,ESPOSITO>而且还不让任何人知道
<12-3,ESPOSITO>And without telling anyone.

308
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:41,060
<12-3,ESPOSITO>他肯定有什么打算
<12-3,ESPOSITO>He's definitely up to something.

309
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,070
<12-3,ESPOSITO>嗯
<12-3,ESPOSITO>Yeah.

310
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:44,700
<12-4,ESPOSITO>哇  《铁胆硬汉》的DVD
<12-4,ESPOSITO>Hey! A "Hard kill" DVD.

311
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,120
<12-4,ESPOSITO>看来兰斯是想回味从前啊
<12-4,ESPOSITO>Looks like Lance was - trying to relive the old days.

312
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,210
<12-5,RYAN>"该克鲁斯控制局面了"
<12-5,RYAN>"Time to hit Cruz control."

313
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,680
<12-5,RYAN>你别说  也许这正是我需要的
<12-5,RYAN>You know, maybe that's what I need...

314
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:51,980
<12-5,RYAN>一句口头禅
<12-5,RYAN>a catchphrase.

315
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,920
<12-5,RYAN>"该主持正义了"
<12-5,RYAN>"Time to mete out justice."

316
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:57,190
<12-5,RYAN>"该...进监狱了"
<12-5,RYAN>"Time... for prison time."

317
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:58,600
<12-6,ESPOSITO>呵呵  你继续  哥们儿
<12-6,ESPOSITO>Yeah, you keep working on that, bro.

318
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,760
<12-7,RYAN>"该为杀人付出代价了"
<12-7,RYAN>"Time to pay the bill for doing the kill."

319
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,500
<12-8,ESPOSITO>好吧  我又一想  还是不要了
<12-8,ESPOSITO>Okay, on second thought, don't.

320
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,680
<12-9,RYAN>看  建筑草图
<12-9,RYAN>Hey. Building schematics?

321
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:08,230
<12-10,ESPOSITO>这纸箱里还有一堆奇怪的东西
<12-10,ESPOSITO>There's a bunch of weird stuff in this box.

322
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:11,900
<12-10,ESPOSITO>烙铁  蓝色颜料
<12-10,ESPOSITO>Soldering iron, blue craft paint,

323
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:15,610
<12-10,ESPOSITO>麦克风  U盘  都是空壳
<12-10,ESPOSITO>A microphone, a USB drive -- both empty cases.

324
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,210
<12-10,ESPOSITO>感觉他是在组装什么东西
<12-10,ESPOSITO>Looks like he was building something,

325
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:19,010
<12-10,ESPOSITO>比如录音装置
<12-10,ESPOSITO>Like a recording device.

326
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:21,040
<12-11,RYAN>还在上面加了贴纸吗
<12-11,RYAN>And then he added stickers to it?

327
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,760
<12-12,ESPOSITO>贴纸  这是怎么回事
<12-12,ESPOSITO>Stickers? - What the hell is that about?

328
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,860
<12-13,RYAN>不知道  但2和5对应的部分没有了
<12-13,RYAN>I don't know, but the "2" And "5" are missing.

329
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,020
<12-14,ESPOSITO>特雷
<12-14,ESPOSITO>"Trey."

330
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,690
<12-14,ESPOSITO>肯定是指特雷·哈蒙  布鲁克·哈蒙的儿子
<12-14,ESPOSITO>Hey, this must be Trey Harmon, Brock Harmon's kid.

331
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,370
<12-15,RYAN>兰斯给他打电话干什么
<12-15,RYAN>Why would Lance call him?

332
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:36,490
<13-1,TREY>他让我给他推荐好的纽约夜店
<13-1,TREY>He wanted to ask me - about the New York club scene.

333
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,290
<13-1,TREY>这事我在行  我是夜店推手
<13-1,TREY>That's my thing. I'm a club promoter.

334
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,510
<13-1,TREY>但说实话  我回绝了他
<13-1,TREY>But I kind of shut him down, to be honest.

335
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:41,220
<13-2,RYAN>为什么
<13-2,RYAN>Why is that?

336
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,460
<13-3,TREY>得了癌症后  他不再酗酒了
<13-3,TREY>After the cancer, he got sober.

337
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:45,410
<13-3,TREY>我不可能帮他重拾旧瘾
<13-3,TREY>No way I was gonna help him fall off the wagon

338
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:47,430
<13-3,TREY>让他又开始玩乐
<13-3,TREY>and start partying again.

339
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,730
<13-4,RYAN>你认得这个吗
<13-4,RYAN>Do you recognize this?

340
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:52,090
<13-4,RYAN>我觉得可能是个夜店的平面图
<13-4,RYAN>I think it might be the floor plan to a club.

341
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,730
<13-5,BROCK>我都没碰到你
<13-5,BROCK>I barely touched you.

342
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:56,730
<13-6,TREY>不知道  我说不好这是什么
<13-6,TREY>I don't know. I can't really tell what that is.

343
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:58,160
<13-6,TREY>这是兰斯的吗
<13-6,TREY>Did Lance have this?

344
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,440
<13-7,RYAN>对  我们觉得他应该不会是想开派对
<13-7,RYAN>Yeah, and we don't think that he wanted to party.

345
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:03,910
<13-7,RYAN>他有告诉你他为什么对夜店感兴趣吗
<13-7,RYAN>Did he explain to you why he was interested in clubs?

346
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:04,950
<13-8,TREY>没有
<13-8,TREY>Not really.

347
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,610
<13-8,TREY>他只说有点事情他必须处理
<13-8,TREY>He just said that there was something that he needed to take care of.

348
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,660
<14-1,CASTLE>有点事情他必须处理
<14-1,CASTLE>There was something he needed to take care of.

349
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,460
<14-1,CASTLE>我有个想法
<14-1,CASTLE>I have a theory.

350
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:14,720
<14-2,BECKETT>很好  我现在正需要一个想法
<14-2,BECKETT>Great, 'cause, right now, I could use one.

351
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,850
<14-3,CASTLE>这是典型的动作电影桥段
<14-3,CASTLE>It's a classic action-movie plot device.

352
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:18,660
<14-3,CASTLE>兰斯  他做特工的日子已远去
<14-3,CASTLE>Lance, his black-op days long behind him,

353
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:21,440
<14-3,CASTLE>但他决定再进行最后一次任务
<14-3,CASTLE>decides to go on one final mission

354
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,150
<14-3,CASTLE>去征服他的宿敌
<14-3,CASTLE>to vanquish his old nemesis.

355
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,230
<14-4,BECKETT>会是谁
<14-4,BECKETT>Which would be?

356
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:27,780
<14-5,CASTLE>他的竞争对手  曾是他最好的朋友
<14-5,CASTLE>Uh, it's a rival assassin who was once his best friend

357
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:28,870
<14-5,CASTLE>但后来背叛了他
<14-5,CASTLE>but then betrayed him.

359
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:31,170
<14-5,CASTLE>或者是布洛菲尔德那样的超级大反派
<14-5,CASTLE>Or, actually, uh, - a Blofeld-style supervillain

360
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:33,480
<14-5,CASTLE>他杀了兰斯的妻子  随后消失了
<14-5,CASTLE>who killed Lance's wife and then disappeared.

361
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,510
<14-6,BECKETT>好吧  但凯特·金斯利还活着呢
<14-6,BECKETT>Yeah, but Kat Kingsley is still alive.

362
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,760
<14-6,BECKETT>不  兰斯的另一个妻子
<14-6,BECKETT>No, Lance's other wife

363
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,560
<14-7,CASTLE>在他以前那可悲又秘密的西情局生涯里娶的
<14-7,CASTLE>from his tragic but secret CNI past.

364
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,220
<14-7,CASTLE>我承认  任务和敌人的细节部分
<14-7,CASTLE>Now, I admit I'm a little sketchy on the details

365
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,060
<14-7,CASTLE>有点模糊
<14-7,CASTLE>of the mission and the nemesis,

366
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:46,360
<14-7,CASTLE>但总之  兰斯在着手一项任务
<14-7,CASTLE>But bottom line is - Lance embarked on a mission.

367
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,900
<14-7,CASTLE>但年事已高  他身手不如从前
<14-7,CASTLE>The years had caught up with him. He had lost a step.

368
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,890
<14-7,CASTLE>他被另一名特工干掉了
<14-7,CASTLE>so he was dispatched by another operative

369
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,390
<14-7,CASTLE>一个更年轻  更敏捷  也更致命的人
<14-7,CASTLE>who was younger, quicker... and deadlier.

370
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:55,340
<14-8,ESPOSITO>而且  很可能是女性
<14-8,ESPOSITO>and...Possibly female.

371
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,080
<14-8,ESPOSITO>托瑞检查了旅馆的监控录像
<14-8,ESPOSITO>Tory screened that security-cam video

372
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,390
<14-8,ESPOSITO>发现了这个
<14-8,ESPOSITO>from the hotel and found this.

373
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,000
<14-8,ESPOSITO>这是兰斯遇害当天
<14-8,ESPOSITO>That's Lance leaving through the hotel lobby

374
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,490
<14-8,ESPOSITO>经过旅馆大堂离开的画面
<14-8,ESPOSITO>on his last day on earth.

375
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:06,840
<14-8,ESPOSITO>10秒钟后  这个女人跟着他出去了
<14-8,ESPOSITO>And 10 seconds later, this woman goes after him.

376
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,370
<14-9,CASTLE>就是她  她就是特工
<14-9,CASTLE>That's her. That's the operative.

377
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:09,830
<14-9,CASTLE>她穿着深色外套
<14-9,CASTLE>She's wearing a dark coat,

378
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:11,700
<14-9,CASTLE>和离开犯罪现场的人一样
<14-9,CASTLE>just like the person who left the crime scene.

379
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,290
<14-9,CASTLE>她肯定从旅馆就尾随兰斯
<14-9,CASTLE>She must have trailed Lance from the hotel,

380
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,710
<14-9,CASTLE>进而杀了他
<14-9,CASTLE>then moved in for the kill.

381
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:17,570
<14-10,BECKETT>她是金发  但可能是假发
<14-10,BECKETT>She's blond, but she might be wearing a wig.

382
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:18,740
<14-10,BECKETT>看看她的太阳镜
<14-10,BECKETT>Take a look at her sunglasses

383
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,880
<14-10,BECKETT>还有她故意让面部角度避开摄像头的方式
<14-10,BECKETT>and the way that she's angled her face away from the camera.

384
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,430
<14-10,BECKETT>她不想被认出来
<14-10,BECKETT>She didn't want to be I.D.'d.

385
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:23,580
<14-11,ESPOSITO>她可能得逞了
<14-11,ESPOSITO>She may have gotten her wish.

386
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,970
<14-11,ESPOSITO>托瑞说镜头画面不足以进行面部识别
<14-11,ESPOSITO>Tory said there's not enough here to run facial recognition.

387
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,460
<14-12,BECKETT>她戴着耳环
<14-12,BECKETT>You know, she's wearing an earring.

388
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,390
<14-12,BECKETT>看看托瑞能不能从那个着手
<14-12,BECKETT>See if Tory can do something with that.

389
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,010
<14-13,BECKETT>恩里克·戈麦斯在来的路上
<14-13,BECKETT>Enrique Gomez is on his way up.

390
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:33,480
<14-14,CASTLE>也许他知道她是谁
<14-14,CASTLE>Maybe he knows who she is.

391
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,350
<15-1,ENRIQUE GOMEZ>不  我认不出她
<15-1,ENRIQUE GOMEZ>Nope. I don't recognize her.

392
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,640
<15-1,ENRIQUE GOMEZ>很遗憾兰斯去世了
<15-1,ENRIQUE GOMEZ>I'm sad to learn of Lance's death.

393
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,420
<15-2,BECKETT>你跟他是什么关系  戈麦斯先生
<15-2,BECKETT>What was your relationship with him, Mr. Gomez?

394
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:44,610
<15-3,GOMEZ>我们年轻的时候很要好  近几年不行了
<15-3,GOMEZ>We were close as young men. Less so recently.

395
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:47,560
<15-4,BECKETT>他死前给你打了电话  为什么
<15-4,BECKETT>Yet, he called you just before he died? Why?

396
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,140
<15-5,GOMEZ>他需要一个保镖  一个他能信任的人
<15-5,GOMEZ>He needed a bodyguard, somebody he could trust.

397
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,670
<15-5,GOMEZ>而我认识这样的人
<15-5,GOMEZ>And I know such people.

398
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,060
<15-5,GOMEZ>可这种临时需求  他们都没空
<15-5,GOMEZ>But none of them were available on such short notice,

399
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,780
<15-5,GOMEZ>所以我没能帮他
<15-5,GOMEZ>so I couldn't help him.

400
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,960
<15-6,BECKETT>兰斯为什么需要保镖
<15-6,BECKETT>Why would Lance need a bodyguard?

401
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,720
<15-7,GOMEZ>他没说  我也没问
<15-7,GOMEZ>He didn't tell me. I didn't ask.

402
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,430
<15-8,CASTLE>你觉得他有可能在执行最后一次任务吗
<15-8,CASTLE>You think maybe he was going on one last mission?

403
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:05,090
<15-8,CASTLE>或是他在西情局的过往找上了他
<15-8,CASTLE>Or perhaps his CNI past was coming back to haunt him.

404
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,720
<15-9,GOMEZ>应该不太可能
<15-9,GOMEZ>Well, that would be rather unlikely.

405
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,970
<15-9,GOMEZ>兰斯并没有什么西情局的过去
<15-9,GOMEZ>You see, Lance didn't have a CNI past.

406
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:14,400
<15-10,BECKETT>那怎么所有人都说他有呢
<15-10,BECKETT>Why is everyone saying that he did?

407
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,300
<15-11,GOMEZ>我们是一起长大的
<15-11,GOMEZ>Well, we grew up together,

408
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:17,380
<15-11,GOMEZ>可加入西情局的人是我
<15-11,GOMEZ>but I was the one who went into CNI.

409
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:18,990
<15-11,GOMEZ>当兰斯来美国的时候
<15-11,GOMEZ>And when Lance came to America,

410
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,350
<15-11,GOMEZ>他求我把背景故事给他用
<15-11,GOMEZ>he asked me to use my backstory

411
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:23,180
<15-11,GOMEZ>这会使他看起来更神秘更有趣
<15-11,GOMEZ>to make himself more mysterious and interesting.

412
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:25,410
<15-11,GOMEZ>对不起
<15-11,GOMEZ>Uh, I'm s-- I'm so-- I'm sorry.

413
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:27,520
<15-12,CASTLE>你是说兰斯·德鲁卡
<15-12,CASTLE>Are you -- - are you saying Lance Delorca

414
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,830
<15-12,CASTLE>以前不是西情局特工吗
<15-12,CASTLE>wasn't a CNI operative?

415
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:31,150
<15-13,GOMEZ>在他进演艺圈之前
<15-13,GOMEZ>Before he started acting,

416
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:34,460
<15-13,GOMEZ>他在比利牛斯山放羊
<15-13,GOMEZ>he was a goat herder in the Pyrenees.

417
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:45,520
<16-1,BECKETT>恩里克·戈麦斯的故事被核实了
<16-1,BECKETT>So, Enrique Gomez's story checks out.

418
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,780
<16-1,BECKETT>经他授权
<16-1,BECKETT>And, with his authorization,

419
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:51,370
<16-1,BECKETT>西情局证实了兰斯·德鲁卡不是他们的探员
<16-1,BECKETT>CNI confirms that Lance Delorca was...never an agent.

420
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:54,520
<16-2,CASTLE>我的英雄是个骗子  还是个放羊的
<16-2,CASTLE>My hero was a liar... and a goat herder.

421
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,550
<16-3,BECKETT>是的  先别管这个严重的个人背叛
<16-3,BECKETT>Yes, well, despite - this deeply personal betrayal,

422
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,290
<16-3,BECKETT>我们还有件谋杀案要破呢
<16-3,BECKETT>we still have a murder to solve.

423
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:01,760
<16-4,CASTLE>-怎么破  我们现在回到起点了  -未必
<16-4,CASTLE>- How? We're back to square one. - Not necessarily.

424
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,060
<16-5,BECKETT>不是还有个从单人间
<16-5,BECKETT>I mean, there's still that mystery woman

425
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,630
<16-5,BECKETT>跟踪兰斯的神秘女人吗
<16-5,BECKETT>that followed Lance from the S.R.O.

426
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,550
<16-6,TORY ELLIS>她可能不再神秘了
<16-6,TORY ELLIS>She may not be a mystery anymore.

427
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:08,880
<16-7,CASTLE>她也是放羊的吗
<16-7,CASTLE>She a goat herder?

428
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:10,270
<16-8,BECKETT>天呐
<16-8,BECKETT>Oh, my god.

429
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:12,760
<17-1,TORY>我没找到这对耳环的出处
<17-1,TORY>I didn't get anywhere with the earrings.

430
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,530
<17-1,TORY>实在太普通  但是我注意到了她的耳朵
<17-1,TORY>They're too common, but that got me focused on her ear.

431
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:17,660
<17-2,BECKETT>耳朵怎么了  看起来很正常
<17-2,BECKETT>Okay. What about it? It looks normal.

432
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,260
<17-3,TORY>是的  但是人耳识别技术
<17-3,TORY>It is, but ear biometrics --

433
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,820
<17-3,TORY>耳朵的大小  形状  结构
<17-3,TORY>size, shape, configuration --

434
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,520
<17-3,TORY>几乎和指纹一样具有唯一性
<17-3,TORY>are almost as unique as fingerprints.

435
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,230
<17-3,TORY>一整个领域都致力于研究这项课题
<17-3,TORY>An entire field of study is devoted to the subject.

436
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:26,600
<17-4,CASTLE>-耳生物学  -耳生物学
<17-4,CASTLE>- Earology. - Earology.

437
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:28,080
<17-6,CASTLE>你怎么知道的
<17-6,CASTLE>How did you know that?

438
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,480
<17-7,BECKETT>联调局研讨会
<17-7,BECKETT>FBI seminar.

439
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:32,630
<17-7,BECKETT>你用她的耳朵找出这个女人的身份了吗
<17-7,BECKETT>So, you used her ear to identify this woman?

440
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,420
<17-8,TORY>是的  通过分离这个耳朵
<17-8,TORY>Yes, by isolating the ear

441
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,620
<17-8,TORY>把它放进面部照片数据库中查找
<17-8,TORY>and running it against the mug-shot database.

442
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:39,100
<17-8,TORY>没有发现  然后我又在和兰斯·德鲁卡
<17-8,TORY>When nothing popped, I ran it against photos of women

443
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:41,300
<17-8,TORY>有关的那些女人的照片中查找
<17-8,TORY>who had any connection with Lance Delorca.

444
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,550
<17-8,TORY>电脑分析了上千张照片
<17-8,TORY>The computer analyzed thousands of images

445
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:44,820
<17-8,TORY>最后找到了相似度
<17-8,TORY>and finally found a match

446
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:48,500
<17-8,TORY>达99.2%的对象  就是这个女人
<17-8,TORY>with a 99.2% probability that it's this woman.

447
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,060
<17-9,BECKETT>是凯特·金斯利
<17-9,BECKETT>That's Kat Kingsley.

448
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:54,060
<17-10,CASTLE>兰斯是被他的准前妻杀害的吗
<17-10,CASTLE>Lance was killed by his soon-to-be ex-wife?

449
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:06,060
<18-1,ESPOSITO>我们听说凯特·金斯利在这里
<18-1,ESPOSITO>Hey. So, we heard Kat Kingsley was here. Whoa!

450
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,910
<18-1,ESPOSITO>穿这套衣服来接受审讯简直太性感了
<18-1,ESPOSITO>And that is a sexy outfit for an interrogation.

451
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:10,110
<18-2,CASTLE>这是她的戏服
<18-2,CASTLE>It's her costume.

452
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:12,580
<18-2,CASTLE>他们把她直接从片场带过来的
<18-2,CASTLE>They took her - right from the set of her movie.

453
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,060
<18-3,RYAN>老兄  她可真是
<18-3,RYAN>Man, she is really --

454
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:16,230
<18-5,RYAN>-性感  -不显老啊
<18-5,RYAN>- Hot? - ...- Holding up well.

455
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,080
<18-6,CASTLE>-什么电影  -是直接发行的影碟
<18-6,CASTLE>- What's the movie? - It's direct-to-video.

456
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,360
<18-6,CASTLE>她饰演的是女版的夺宝奇兵
<18-6,CASTLE>She plays a female Indiana Jones.

457
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,670
<18-7,RYAN>她又演考古学家吗
<18-7,RYAN>She's an archaeologist again?

458
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:22,540
<18-8,CASTLE>你们认为我求她给这个签名
<18-8,CASTLE>So, do you think it would be weird

459
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,100
<18-8,CASTLE>会不会有点怪
<18-8,CASTLE>if I asked her to sign this?

460
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,900
<18-9,RYAN>什么时候签  去监狱的路上吗
<18-9,RYAN>When? On her way to jail?

461
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,940
<18-10,CASTLE>这会对我意义重大的
<18-10,CASTLE>It would mean so much to me.

462
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,070
<18-11,ESPOSITO>她杀害兰斯的动机是什么
<18-11,ESPOSITO>What would her motivation be for killing Lance?

463
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:32,610
<18-12,CASTLE>看起来她的离婚过程比她说得
<18-12,CASTLE>Well, it seems her divorce was a tad messier

464
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:34,120
<18-12,CASTLE>要混乱得多
<18-12,CASTLE>than she led us to believe.

465
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:38,190
<19-1,BECKETT>你这次扮演的是什么角色  金斯利女士
<19-1,BECKETT>So, what role are you playing now, Ms. Kingsley?

466
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:39,650
<19-1,BECKETT>肯定不是悲伤寡妇
<19-1,BECKETT>Not the grieving widow.

467
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,070
<19-2,KAT>我必须回到片场
<19-2,KAT>I need to get back to set,

468
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:43,570
<19-2,KAT>不然他们会停止制作
<19-2,KAT>or they're gonna shut down production

469
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,510
<19-2,KAT>《夺宝奇兵之努比亚神庙》
<19-2,KAT>on "Raiders of the Nubian temple."

470
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:48,390
<19-3,BECKETT>是啊  可是你现在有个更严重的问题
<19-3,BECKETT>Yeah, well, you've got bigger problems than that.

471
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:49,930
<19-3,BECKETT>我跟兰斯的律师谈过了
<19-3,BECKETT>So, I talked to Lance's lawyer,

472
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:53,730
<19-3,BECKETT>他说你们的离婚过程一点也不平和
<19-3,BECKETT>and he said that your divorce was anything but amicable.

473
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:57,020
<19-4,KAT>我们是演员  都是充满激情的人
<19-4,KAT>We're actors. We're passionate people.

474
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,540
<19-4,KAT>有时候是会闹得激烈一些
<19-4,KAT>Things got stormy at times.

475
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,270
<19-5,BECKETT>因为你想得到马里布的房子
<19-5,BECKETT>Because you wanted the Malibu house,

476
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,310
<19-5,BECKETT>而他不想给你
<19-5,BECKETT>and he didn't want to give it to you.

477
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,530
<19-6,KAT>那套房子对我有情感价值
<19-6,KAT>That home has sentimental value to me.

478
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:04,720
<19-7,BECKETT>还有金钱价值
<19-7,BECKETT>Along with monetary value.

479
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,780
<19-7,BECKETT>我是说  过了二十年  它值
<19-7,BECKETT>I mean, after 20 years, it's worth...

480
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,050
<19-7,BECKETT>八百万美元
<19-7,BECKETT>$8 million.

481
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:09,890
<19-7,BECKETT>现在兰斯死了
<19-7,BECKETT>And with Lance out of the picture,

482
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,140
<19-7,BECKETT>这些就都是你的了
<19-7,BECKETT>it was all yours.

483
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,620
<19-8,KAT>你认为是我杀了我丈夫吗
<19-8,KAT>You think I killed my husband?

484
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,990
<19-9,BECKETT>你之前确实试图这么干过
<19-9,BECKETT>You tried to before.

485
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,400
<19-9,BECKETT>还记得那次事故吗
<19-9,BECKETT>Remember the incident

486
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,230
<19-9,BECKETT>你朝他开枪那次
<19-9,BECKETT>where you discharged a firearm...at him?

487
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,490
<19-10,KAT>我是在擦枪
<19-10,KAT>I was cleaning it.

488
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,480
<19-11,BECKETT>我分辨得出糟糕的表演
<19-11,BECKETT>I know bad acting when I see it.

489
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:27,050
<19-11,BECKETT>就是你  金斯利女士
<19-11,BECKETT>This is you, Ms. Kingsley,

490
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:30,920
<19-11,BECKETT>在兰斯被杀前数小时  跟踪了他
<19-11,BECKETT>following Lance hours before he was killed.

491
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:33,100
<19-12,KAT>我并不是在跟踪他
<19-12,KAT>I was not following him.

492
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,900
<19-12,KAT>他求我去见他
<19-12,KAT>He asked me to meet with him.

493
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,180
<19-13,BECKETT>他让你伪装了吗
<19-13,BECKETT>And he told you to wear a disguise?

494
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:40,160
<19-14,KAT>开枪事件后  我不能被别人看见跟他在一起
<19-14,KAT>I couldn't be seen with him after the gun thing.

495
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,560
<19-14,KAT>我们被告之要避免接触
<19-14,KAT>We were told to avoid contact.

496
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,300
<19-14,KAT>但是兰斯求我
<19-14,KAT>But Lance begged me.

497
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:47,120
<19-14,KAT>他需要现金  二十万
<19-14,KAT>He needed cash -- $200,000.

498
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,290
<19-15,BECKETT>他问你借钱吗
<19-15,BECKETT>He asked you for a loan?

499
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:50,980
<19-16,KAT>他的资产都因离婚官司而冻结了
<19-16,KAT>His assets were all tied up with the divorce.

500
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:53,610
<19-16,KAT>我继承了一些钱  他知道我可以拿到
<19-16,KAT>I inherited some money. He knew I had access to it.

501
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:54,940
<19-16,KAT>不是借钱
<19-16,KAT>It wasn't a loan.

502
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:57,260
<19-16,KAT>他把马里布房子的一半卖给了我
<19-16,KAT>He sold me his half of the Malibu house.

503
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,040
<19-17,BECKETT>你是说
<19-17,BECKETT>Are you telling me

504
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:03,120
<19-17,BECKETT>他用四百万万跟你换二十吗
<19-17,BECKETT>that he traded you $4 million for $200,000?

505
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,310
<19-18,KAT>我怎么能拒绝这样的交易呢
<19-18,KAT>How could I pass up a deal like that?

506
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:07,550
<19-18,KAT>我有本票  可以证实这件事
<19-18,KAT>I have the promissory note to prove it.

507
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:08,890
<19-19,BECKETT>他为什么需要钱
<19-19,BECKETT>Why did he need the money?

508
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:11,720
<19-19,BECKETT>他说他需要摆平一些事
<19-19,BECKETT>He said he needed to set something right,

509
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,990
<19-20,KAT>好像是说  他想像他扮演的角色一样英勇
<19-20,KAT>that he wanted to live up to the characters he played, I think.

510
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,760
<19-20,KAT>我没怎么仔细听
<19-20,KAT>I wasn't really listening.

511
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,260
<19-20,KAT>我只是想让他签字卖房
<19-20,KAT>I just wanted him to sign over the house.

512
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,190
<19-20,KAT>我说的都是实话
<19-20,KAT>I'm just being honest.

513
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:23,040
<19-21,BECKETT>如果你说的都是实话
<19-21,BECKETT>Okay, fine, if you're being honest,

514
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,030
<19-21,BECKETT>那为什么不告诉我...
<19-21,BECKETT>then why don't you tell me this --

515
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:24,870
<19-21,BECKETT>我们有目击者称
<19-21,BECKETT>We have a witness

516
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,640
<19-21,BECKETT>看到一个黑影从犯罪现场逃脱
<19-21,BECKETT>that saw a dark figure fleeing the crime scene.

517
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,750
<19-21,BECKETT>那是你吗
<19-21,BECKETT>Was that you?

518
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,680
<19-22,KAT>是的
<19-22,KAT>Yes.

519
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,020
<19-23,BECKETT>你能解释一下吗
<19-23,BECKETT>Do you want to elaborate on that?

520
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:38,650
<19-24,KAT>那晚兰斯用投币电话打给我
<19-24,KAT>Lance called me that night from a pay phone.

521
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,430
<19-24,KAT>他说他有麻烦了
<19-24,KAT>I think he said he was in trouble

522
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:42,190
<19-24,KAT>有人在追他
<19-24,KAT>and that people were after him.

523
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:42,860
<19-25,BECKETT>什么人
<19-25,BECKETT>What people?

524
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:43,950
<19-25,BECKETT>他没说
<19-25,BECKETT>He didn't say.

525
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:45,440
<19-26,KAT>不过他让我去接他
<19-26,KAT>But he asked me to pick him up

526
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,500
<19-26,KAT>就在那个放《铁胆硬汉》的电影院
<19-26,KAT>at this theater playing "Hard kill,"

527
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,440
<19-26,KAT>那样比较容易找到
<19-26,KAT>that it would be easy to find.

528
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,040
<19-26,KAT>他的声音听起来很绝望
<19-26,KAT>H-he sounded so desperate.

529
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,780
<19-26,KAT>但当我到达那里的时候
<19-26,KAT>But when I got there...

530
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,170
<19-26,KAT>他已经死了
<19-26,KAT>...He was dead.

531
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:59,530
<19-27,BECKETT>之前你为什么不告诉我们这些事
<19-27,BECKETT>Why didn't you tell us this before?

532
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:00,680
<19-28,KAT>我慌了
<19-28,KAT>I panicked.

533
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,100
<19-28,KAT>我正想重新开展我的事业
<19-28,KAT>I'm trying to restart my career.

534
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,960
<19-28,KAT>我知道这看起来就像我是凶手
<19-28,KAT>I just knew how it might look.

535
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,750
<19-29,BECKETT>那是因为这的确看起来就像你是凶手
<19-29,BECKETT>Well, that's because - it's exactly how it does look.

536
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,820
<20-1,CASTLE>在我看来不是
<20-1,CASTLE>Well, not to me it doesn't.

537
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,250
<20-1,CASTLE>我认为她不是凶手
<20-1,CASTLE>I don't think she's our killer.

538
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,460
<20-2,BECKETT>是啊  她就是个无辜的考古学家
<20-2,BECKETT>Yeah, she's just an innocent archaeologist.

539
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:16,730
<20-3,CASTLE>我的意见并未被她暴露的穿着左右
<20-3,CASTLE>My opinion is not affected by her skimpy outfit.

540
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:19,330
<20-3,CASTLE>我完全是以客观严谨
<20-3,CASTLE>I'm speaking as an objective investigator,

541
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:21,450
<20-3,CASTLE>不受个人感情影响的调查员的态度看待此事
<20-3,CASTLE>someone who has set their personal feelings aside.

542
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,610
<20-4,BECKETT>-还有你的海报呢  -谁告诉你的
<20-4,BECKETT>- Along with your poster? - Who told you?

543
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:24,620
<20-5,CASTLE>是莱恩吧  对吗
<20-5,CASTLE>It was Ryan, wasn't it?

544
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:27,360
<20-6,BECKETT>卡塞尔  凯特·金斯利承认去过现场
<20-6,BECKETT>Castle, Kat Kingsley admitted to being at the crime scene.

545
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,480
<20-7,CASTLE>在她根本没必要承认的情况下
<20-7,CASTLE>Yeah, when she didn't have to.

546
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,050
<20-7,CASTLE>她要是真有罪为什么要承认呢
<20-7,CASTLE>Why admit to that if you're actually guilty?

547
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:31,520
<20-8,BECKETT>以制造她无罪的假象
<20-8,BECKETT>To make herself look not guilty.

548
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,140
<20-8,BECKETT>她有动机
<20-8,BECKETT>Look, she had motive.

549
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,940
<20-9,CASTLE>但她的说法还是有真实的部分的
<20-9,CASTLE>But parts of her story still check out --

550
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,120
<20-9,CASTLE>她提到的本票
<20-9,CASTLE>the promissory note,

551
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,230
<20-9,CASTLE>她从银行提取的二十万美元
<20-9,CASTLE>the withdrawal from her bank for $200,000.

552
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:41,570
<20-9,CASTLE>兰斯说他需要这笔钱摆平一件事
<20-9,CASTLE>Lance said he needed the money to set something right.

553
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:43,680
<20-9,CASTLE>他想像他扮演的角色一样英勇
<20-9,CASTLE>He needed to live up to his on-screen persona.

554
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,990
<20-10,BECKETT>没错  但这说法来自犯罪嫌疑人
<20-10,BECKETT>Yes, according to our murder suspect.

555
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:50,470
<20-11,CASTLE>这是兰斯和他的骨髓捐献者的照片
<20-11,CASTLE>So, here's Lance meeting his bone-marrow donor.

556
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,400
<20-11,CASTLE>也许战胜白血病改变了他
<20-11,CASTLE>Perhaps surviving leukemia changed him,

557
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,950
<20-11,CASTLE>让他想做个更好的人
<20-11,CASTLE>drove him to become a better man,

558
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:57,150
<20-11,CASTLE>更像他演绎过的英雄那样的人
<20-11,CASTLE>a man more like the hero he portrayed.

559
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:59,310
<20-11,CASTLE>所以  当他在旅店登记时
<20-11,CASTLE>That's why, when he registered at the hotel,

560
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:03,570
<20-11,CASTLE>用了瑞克·克鲁兹  因为他进入了角色
<20-11,CASTLE>he did so as Rico Cruz, because he became Rico Curz.

561
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:04,840
<20-12,BECKETT>你在说什么啊
<20-12,BECKETT>What does that even mean?

562
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,570
<20-13,CASTLE>就是  哪怕曾经只是个牧羊人
<20-13,CASTLE>That, despite being an ex-goat herder

563
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:08,680
<20-13,CASTLE>完全没受过间谍训练
<20-13,CASTLE>with no formal black-ops training,

564
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:10,070
<20-13,CASTLE>兰斯却开始了一项任务
<20-13,CASTLE>Lance took on a mission.

565
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:12,420
<20-14,BECKETT>好吧  又回到最后的任务上来了
<20-14,BECKETT>Oh, okay, so we're back to "One last mission" now.

566
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,690
<20-15,CASTLE>否则他为什么需要构造图
<20-15,CASTLE>Why else would he have the schematic

567
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:14,410
<20-15,CASTLE>和窃听器呢
<20-15,CASTLE>or the listening device?

568
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:16,670
<20-15,CASTLE>还有为什么需要保镖呢
<20-15,CASTLE>Or why would he need a bodyguard?

569
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:19,430
<20-16,BECKETT>保护自己不受凯特·金斯利的伤害
<20-16,BECKETT>To protect himself from Kat Kingsley.

570
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:21,090
<20-17,RYAN>不过她的说法站得住脚
<20-17,RYAN>Yeah, except for her story is still holding up.

571
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:22,930
<20-17,RYAN>她说接到的那通兰斯的电话
<20-17,RYAN>That call she says was from lance

572
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:25,330
<20-17,RYAN>是离影院六条街远的一个公共电话打来的
<20-17,RYAN>came from a pay phone six blocks from the movie theater.

573
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:26,560
<20-18,BECKETT>好吧  追查是否有目击者
<20-18,BECKETT>All right, canvass for witnesses

574
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,990
<20-18,BECKETT>看到兰斯或者别人接近过那个电话
<20-18,BECKETT>that saw Lance or anyone else by that pay phone.

575
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:31,820
<20-18,BECKETT>如果像凯特说的   他真的有麻烦了
<20-18,BECKETT>And if he was in trouble, as Kat said,

576
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:33,570
<20-18,BECKETT>那就查查哪来的麻烦
<20-18,BECKETT>then let's find out where he was coming from.

577
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:34,130
<20-19,RYAN>马上去查
<20-19,RYAN>We'll get into it,

578
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:36,060
<20-19,RYAN>但可能要明早才能有消息了
<20-19,RYAN>but we might not have anything till the morning.

579
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:36,940
<20-20,BECKETT>好
<20-20,BECKETT>Okay.

580
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,160
<20-21,CASTLE>你把海报的事告诉她了
<20-21,CASTLE>You told her about the poster.

581
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:40,610
<20-22,RYAN>我不知道这是个秘密啊
<20-22,RYAN>I didn't know it was a se--

582
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,450
<20-22,RYAN>我不知道
<20-22,RYAN>I don't know.

583
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:46,130
<21-1,BECKETT>也许是他说的方式
<21-1,BECKETT>Maybe it's the way that he said it

584
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:47,280
<21-1,BECKETT>刺激到了我吧
<21-1,BECKETT>that struck a nerve.

585
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:50,520
<21-2,LANIE>察言观色也不是他的特长啊
<21-2,LANIE>Well, tact isn't exactly the man's middle name.

586
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:53,920
<21-3,BECKETT>好吧  但这是我的家  不是卡塞尔的
<21-3,BECKETT>Okay, but it's my place, you know? It's not Castle's.

587
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,800
<21-3,BECKETT>谁在乎他喜不喜欢
<21-3,BECKETT>Who cares if he never liked it?

588
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,730
<21-3,BECKETT>我也不知道自己为什么这么郁闷
<21-3,BECKETT>I mean, I don't know why I got so upset.

589
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:02,180
<21-4,LANIE>因为对他这里不过是地板吱吱作响的破房子
<21-4,LANIE>Because, to him, this is just an apartment with creaky floors.

590
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:05,740
<21-4,LANIE>但对你  这里是你重新开始生活的地方
<21-4,LANIE>But to you, this is where you rebuilt your life,

591
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,530
<21-4,LANIE>你在这侦破你母亲的案子
<21-4,LANIE>where you solved your mother's murder,

592
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:09,240
<21-4,LANIE>坠入爱河
<21-4,LANIE>where you fell in love.

593
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,390
<21-5,BECKETT>那
<21-5,BECKETT>Well...

594
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,440
<21-6,LANIE>敬最棒的公寓
<21-6,LANIE>To the best apartment ever.

595
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,710
<21-6,LANIE>敬最棒的公寓
<21-6,LANIE>To the best apartment ever.

596
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,930
<22-1,RYAN>找到目击者  发现重要线索
<22-1,RYAN>So, we struck gold on that canvass.

597
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,520
<22-2,BECKETT>有人看到兰斯用那台电话了
<22-2,BECKETT>Someone saw Lance using the pay phone?

598
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,310
<22-3,RYAN>没  但之前有人看到他
<22-3,RYAN>No, but they saw him before that

599
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,840
<22-3,RYAN>从一条小巷慌张地跑出来
<22-3,RYAN>running like hell from an alley.

600
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,960
<22-4,ESPOSITO>指引我们在附近找到这份监控录像
<22-4,ESPOSITO>Which leads us to this security-cam video right here.

601
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,410
<22-4,ESPOSITO>不亲眼见到你绝对不会相信
<22-4,ESPOSITO>You got to see it to believe it.

602
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:38,210
<22-4,ESPOSITO>这四个人围住了兰斯
<22-4,ESPOSITO>These four guys have got Lance cornered.

603
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:40,660
<22-5,CASTLE>糟糕了
<22-5,CASTLE>Oh, this can't be good.

604
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,420
<22-6,BECKETT>这些人是谁啊
<22-6,BECKETT>Who are those guys?

605
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,810
<22-7,RYAN>不知道  但不禁让人去想
<22-7,RYAN>I don't know, but makes you wonder

606
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:45,510
<22-7,RYAN>兰斯干了什么  招惹到他们
<22-7,RYAN>what Lance did to have them come after him.

607
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:48,670
<22-8,CASTLE>上了年纪的兰斯·德鲁卡面对四个暴徒
<22-8,CASTLE>Four thugs against a-an aging Lance Delorca?

608
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:50,110
<22-8,CASTLE>我不敢看了
<22-8,CASTLE>I don't know that I can watch.

609
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,200
<22-9,CASTLE>你看到了吗
<22-9,CASTLE>Did you see that?!

610
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,530
<22-9,CASTLE>兰斯刚刚的举动
<22-9,CASTLE>What Lance just did...

611
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,990
<22-9,CASTLE>简直就是他影片里的情节
<22-9,CASTLE>that belongs in one of his movies.

612
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,540
<22-9,CASTLE>他解决了他们
<22-9,CASTLE>He annihilated them.

613
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,370
<22-10,ESPOSITO>但没过多久
<22-10,ESPOSITO>Yeah, but not for long.

614
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:15,490
<22-10,ESPOSITO>半小时后  他就被别人解决了
<22-10,ESPOSITO>Half an hour later, someone annihilated him.

615
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:16,870
<22-11,CASTLE>好吧
<22-11,CASTLE>Ah, well, right.

616
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:19,160
<22-11,CASTLE>至少这解释了电话的事
<22-11,CASTLE>But at least this explains the phone call.

617
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,980
<22-11,CASTLE>兰斯打给凯特·金斯利
<22-11,CASTLE>When Lance called Kat Kingsley

618
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:23,220
<22-11,CASTLE>说我有麻烦了  有人在追我
<22-11,CASTLE>and said, "I'm in trouble and people are after me,"

619
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,680
<22-11,CASTLE>指的就是这件事
<22-11,CASTLE>this is what he was talking about.

620
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:27,000
<22-12,BECKETT>不管这些人是谁  肯定又找上了他
<22-12,BECKETT>And whoever these guys are, they must have caught up to him.

621
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,070
<22-12,BECKETT>只要找到他们  就能找到凶手
<22-12,BECKETT>We find these guys, we'll find our killer.

622
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:39,310
<23-1,BECKETT>从监控录像没法确认他们的身份
<23-1,BECKETT>We can't I.D. any of these guys off of the surveillance video.

623
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:41,440
<23-1,BECKETT>托瑞说图像清晰度太低
<23-1,BECKETT>Tory says that the image quality is too poor

624
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,830
<23-1,BECKETT>面部识别和耳纹识别都没法做
<23-1,BECKETT>to run facial recognition, or ear recognition.

625
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:47,030
<23-2,CASTLE>关键在于弄清楚兰斯在去
<23-2,CASTLE>The key is finding out what happened to Lance

626
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:49,270
<23-2,CASTLE>那条小巷之前发生了什么
<23-2,CASTLE>before he wound up in that alley --

627
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:53,510
<23-2,CASTLE>一件需要二十万美元和窃听器办的事
<23-2,CASTLE>Something that required $200,000 and a listening device.

628
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:55,110
<23-2,CASTLE>不管他对付的是谁
<23-2,CASTLE>But whomever he went up against

629
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:57,230
<23-2,CASTLE>就是这个人派来的打手
<23-2,CASTLE>sent those four sides of beef after him.

630
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:59,180
<23-3,ESPOSITO>看过这些人被痛扁
<23-3,ESPOSITO>And, after seeing the ass-whupping they got,

631
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,740
<23-3,ESPOSITO>我去查了周围的医院
<23-3,ESPOSITO>I checked nearby hospitals.

632
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,990
<23-3,ESPOSITO>在那个时间段  有人往这附近
<23-3,ESPOSITO>Turns out that an ambulance was called to that area

633
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:04,480
<23-3,ESPOSITO>叫了救护车
<23-3,ESPOSITO>during our time window.

634
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:06,410
<23-3,ESPOSITO>载着一个体格魁梧的家伙去了急诊
<23-3,ESPOSITO>They brought in a heavy-set dude to the E.R.

635
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:09,210
<23-3,ESPOSITO>昏迷不醒  带有瘀伤  下巴可能骨折了
<23-3,ESPOSITO>He was unconscious, bruised, and had a possible broken jaw.

636
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:10,750
<23-4,RYAN>-好吧  去找他聊聊  -不行
<23-4,RYAN>- All right, let's go talk to him. - We can't.

637
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,310
<23-5,ESPOSITO>他醒来后就自己办了出院手续
<23-5,ESPOSITO>He woke up and checked himself out of the E.R.

638
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,610
<23-5,ESPOSITO>他们都没来得及记下名字
<23-5,ESPOSITO>before they could even get his name.

639
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:14,890
<23-6,BECKETT>那医院有监控吗
<23-6,BECKETT>Does the hospital have cameras?

640
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:16,210
<23-7,ESPOSITO>很高兴你问了
<23-7,ESPOSITO>I'm glad you asked that.

641
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:20,560
<23-7,ESPOSITO>这人绝对就是录像中的其中一个
<23-7,ESPOSITO>This guy definitely looks like one of the guys from the video.

642
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:21,930
<23-8,RYAN>等等  我见过这个人
<23-8,RYAN>Wait a second. I know that guy.

643
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:25,340
<23-8,RYAN>在拍摄现场  他当时一身阿富汗打扮
<23-8,RYAN>Yeah, from the film set. He was dressed in Afghan Garb.

644
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,870
<23-8,RYAN>布鲁克·哈蒙都没怎么碰到他的脸
<23-8,RYAN>Brock Harmon barely tapped him in the face,

645
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:29,270
<23-8,RYAN>他就大喊起来
<23-8,RYAN>and he screamed like a baby.

646
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:31,890
<23-9,CASTLE>也许是因为他下巴骨折了
<23-9,CASTLE>Perhaps because he has a broken jaw.

647
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:36,740
<24-1,ESPOSITO>片场助手说他叫欧尼斯特·豪
<24-1,ESPOSITO>A.D. says his name is Ernest Howe.

648
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,630
<24-1,ESPOSITO>扮演的是恐怖组织士兵12号
<24-1,ESPOSITO>And he's playing isis militant number 12.

649
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,580
<24-1,ESPOSITO>演到头了
<24-1,ESPOSITO>Not for long.

650
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:42,030
<24-2,RYAN>你知道现在是什么时候吗  莱恩时刻
<24-2,RYAN>You know what time it is? It's Ryan time.

651
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:43,690
<24-3,ESPOSITO>拜托  够了
<24-3,ESPOSITO>Please. Just stop.

652
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,580
<24-4,RYAN>我是莱恩  我痛恨谎言
<24-4,RYAN>My name's Ryan, and I hate lyin'.

653
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:48,380
<24-4,RYAN>欧尼斯特·豪  纽约警察
<24-4,RYAN>Ernest Howe. NYPD.

654
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:50,600
<24-5,ESPOSITO>我们来跟你谈谈兰斯·德鲁卡
<24-5,ESPOSITO>We're here to talk to you about Lance Delorca.

655
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,420
<24-6,ERNEST HOWE>他死了真是遗憾
<24-6,ERNEST HOWE>Yeah, it's a bummer that he died.

656
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,370
<24-7,RYAN>你的下巴怎么了  欧尼斯特
<24-7,RYAN>Got a little problem with your jaw there, Ernest?

657
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:55,260
<24-8,ERNEST>轻微颞下颌紊乱
<24-8,ERNEST>Little TMJ.

658
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,570
<24-9,ESPOSITO>你确定不是因为那天晚上
<24-9,ESPOSITO>You sure it's not - from that little altercation

659
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:57,850
<24-9,ESPOSITO>你参与的某场斗殴吗
<24-9,ESPOSITO>you got into the other night?

660
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:59,820
<24-10,ERNEST>我不想再惹上什么麻烦了
<24-10,ERNEST>Look, I don't want any more trouble.

661
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:02,270
<24-11,RYAN>你有麻烦了  莱恩式麻烦
<24-11,RYAN>Well, you got trouble -- Ryan trouble.

662
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:05,710
<24-12,ERNEST>-没听说过  -有监控拍到了你
<24-12,ERNEST>- I don't know what that means. - We have you on video.

663
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:07,670
<24-13,ESPOSITO>你和其他三个打手袭击了兰斯
<24-13,ESPOSITO>You and those three mooks attacked Lance,

664
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,800
<24-13,ESPOSITO>受伤的却是你们
<24-13,ESPOSITO>and he put the hurt on all of you.

665
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,280
<24-14,RYAN>不过显然不重  因为你们其中有人杀了他
<24-14,RYAN>But not enough hurt, because one of them killed him.

666
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,320
<24-14,RYAN>既然你去了急诊  说明这人不是你
<24-14,RYAN>Judging by your little trip to the E.R., it wasn't you.

667
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,270
<24-14,RYAN>所以你最好告诉我们你同伙的名字
<24-14,RYAN>So why don't you give us the name of your buddies, Ernest,

668
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:16,730
<24-14,RYAN>-还有下命令的人  -你们搞错了
<24-14,RYAN>- and whoever put them up to this. - You got it all wrong.

669
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,260
<24-15,ERNEST>我的伤就是那些人打的
<24-15,ERNEST>Those guys did this to me.

670
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:21,490
<24-15,ERNEST>我和兰斯是一伙的  他让我当他的保镖
<24-15,ERNEST>I was on Lance's side. He hired me to be his bodyguard.

671
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:23,270
<24-16,ESPOSITO>为什么兰斯需要保镖
<24-16,ESPOSITO>Why would Lance need a bodyguard?

672
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:26,030
<24-17,ERNEST>他在漂移俱乐部和人碰面  他想找后援
<24-17,ERNEST>He had a meeting at Club Drift. He wanted backup.

673
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,930
<24-17,ERNEST>他带了个手提箱  我觉得里面装了钱
<24-17,ERNEST>He brought a briefcase. I think it had money on it.

674
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:29,940
<24-18,RYAN>他在那和谁碰面  带钱干什么
<24-18,RYAN>Who did he meet there and what was the money for?

675
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,430
<24-19,ERNEST>我不知道  他们让我在楼下等
<24-19,ERNEST>I don't know. They made me wait downstairs.

676
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:34,430
<24-19,ERNEST>但是会面很快就结束了
<24-19,ERNEST>But the meeting ended quick.

677
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:37,010
<24-19,ERNEST>突然四个保安推搡着让我们赶紧走
<24-19,ERNEST>All of a sudden, four security dudes hustled us out

678
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:39,100
<24-20,ESPOSITO>说兰斯戴了窃听器
<24-20,ESPOSITO>and accused Lance of wearing a wire.

679
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:41,970
<24-20,ESPOSITO>窃听器  他为什么要戴窃听器
<24-20,ESPOSITO>A wire? - Why would he be wearing a wire?

680
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:43,650
<24-21,ERNEST>我还没来得及问
<24-21,ERNEST>Well, I didn't exactly get a chance to ask.

681
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:44,610
<24-21,ERNEST>我最后记得的就是
<24-21,ERNEST>The last thing I remember was

682
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:46,480
<24-21,ERNEST>一个家伙用脚踹了我的脸
<24-21,ERNEST>a guy's foot flying across my face.

683
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,070
<25-1,CASTLE>可能兰斯的确戴了窃听器
<25-1,CASTLE>Maybe Lance was wearing a wire.

684
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,350
<25-1,CASTLE>这样就能解释那个麦克风和闪存盘
<25-1,CASTLE>That would explain the microphone and the usb drive.

685
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:53,200
<25-2,ESPOSITO>不  欧尼斯特说保安并没有找到窃听器
<25-2,ESPOSITO>Nah, Ernest said that security didn't find a wire,

686
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,850
<25-2,ESPOSITO>而且兰斯的身上也没有
<25-2,ESPOSITO>and there wasn't one on Lance's body.

687
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:56,830
<25-3,RYAN>但我们假设一下他确实戴了窃听器
<25-3,RYAN>But let's say he was all wired up

688
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:58,100
<25-3,RYAN>并且拿了一箱子钱
<25-3,RYAN>with a briefcase of money.

689
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,390
<25-3,RYAN>他到底要干什么呢
<25-3,RYAN>What the hell was he doing?

690
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:00,760
<25-4,ESPOSITO>好像兰斯
<25-4,ESPOSITO>It's like Lance is running

691
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,810
<25-4,ESPOSITO>在尝试一个计划不完善的诱捕行动
<25-4,ESPOSITO>some kind of half-assed sting operation.

692
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:04,420
<25-5,BECKETT>说不定他就是  我和缉毒队谈过了
<25-5,BECKETT>Maybe he was. I spoke to Narcotics.

693
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:07,810
<25-5,BECKETT>兰斯去的那家俱乐部是贩卖毒品的窝点
<25-5,BECKETT>The club that Lance went to is a major hub for drug sales,

694
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:10,090
<25-5,BECKETT>卡塞尔  那俱乐部是你熟悉的人经营的
<25-5,BECKETT>run by a guy that you're familiar with, Castle.

695
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:11,800
<25-6,CASTLE>这是
<25-6,CASTLE>Is...

696
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:13,630
<25-6,CASTLE>这是那个亨利·艾伦·布斯吗
<25-6,CASTLE>Is that Henry Allen Boothe?

697
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,910
<25-7,ESPOSITO>《铁胆硬汉》里的大佬
<25-7,ESPOSITO>El Jéfe from "Hard Kill"?

698
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:17,840
<25-8,CASTLE>他就是靠演一个毒贩子而火起来的
<25-8,CASTLE>He made a career - out of playing drug dealers

699
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,910
<25-8,CASTLE>之后他不再演戏
<25-8,CASTLE>and then he quit acting.

700
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,390
<25-9,BECKETT>直接做起了毒枭
<25-9,BECKETT>And then he began living the part.

701
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:23,530
<25-9,BECKETT>显然  他花了太多时间和毒贩在一起
<25-9,BECKETT>Apparently, he spent so much time with drug dealers

702
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:26,510
<25-9,BECKETT>研究角色以致他自己成为了一名毒贩
<25-9,BECKETT>researching his roles that he actually became one.

703
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:29,320
<25-9,BECKETT>不过缉毒队一直没法对他立案
<25-9,BECKETT>Narcotics hasn't been able to make a case against him, though.

704
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,820
<25-10,CASTLE>这就像《铁血硬汉》里的剧情一样
<25-10,CASTLE>This is just like "Hard kill,"

705
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:33,080
<25-10,CASTLE>瑞克·克鲁斯除掉了大佬
<25-10,CASTLE>Where Rico Cruz took down El Jéfe.

706
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,120
<25-10,CASTLE>只不过现在是一个演员要除掉另一个演员
<25-10,CASTLE>Only, now it's one actor taking on the other actor,

707
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,490
<25-10,CASTLE>可这另一个演员恰好是一毒贩
<25-10,CASTLE>but the other actor actually happens to be a drug dealer.

708
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,730
<25-11,RYAN>但是  为什么兰斯要这么做呢
<25-11,RYAN>But, a-again, why would Lance do this?

709
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:42,010
<25-11,RYAN>为什么他要去追查布斯呢
<25-11,RYAN>Why would he go after Boothe?

710
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:43,540
<25-12,CASTLE>我不知道  但是这也太戏剧化了
<25-12,CASTLE>I don't know, but it's so meta!

711
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,900
<25-12,CASTLE>我们得和大佬谈谈
<25-12,CASTLE>We should really talk to El Jéfe.

712
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,110
<25-13,BECKETT>相信我  我们会的
<25-13,BECKETT>Oh, believe me -- we will.

713
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,390
<26-1,HENRY ALLEN BOOTH>是的  我和兰斯见过
<26-1,HENRY ALLEN BOOTH>Yeah, sure, I met with Lance.

714
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:50,130
<26-2,BECKETT>你们谈了些什么呢
<26-2,BECKETT>What about?

715
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:51,940
<26-3,BOOTH>怀念旧时光
<26-3,BOOTH>Mm, old times.

716
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:55,090
<26-3,BOOTH>他想和我喝一杯  重温过去的光辉岁月
<26-3,BOOTH>He wanted to share a drink, relive the glory days.

717
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,380
<26-4,CASTLE>这么突然吗
<26-4,CASTLE>Just out of the blue?

718
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:58,440
<26-5,BOOTH>为什么不呢  《铁血硬汉》让我俩收获颇丰
<26-5,BOOTH>Why not? "Hard Kill" - did a solid for both of us.

719
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,100
<26-5,BOOTH>即使过了这么多年
<26-5,BOOTH>Even after all these years, not a day goes by

720
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,420
<26-5,BOOTH>每天都会有些中年人看到我
<26-5,BOOTH>where some middle-aged dude doesn't see me

721
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,180
<26-5,BOOTH>大喊"大佬"
<26-5,BOOTH>and shout, "El Jéfe!"

722
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:06,100
<26-5,BOOTH>我想我也没什么好抱怨的
<26-5,BOOTH>I suppose I shouldn't complain.

723
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,070
<26-5,BOOTH>那个角色让我拥有了这家俱乐部
<26-5,BOOTH>That role bought me this club.

724
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:10,850
<26-6,BECKETT>布斯先生  据我们所知它给你的可不止这个
<26-6,BECKETT>We hear that it did more than that, Mr. Boothe.

725
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:18,710
<26-7,BOOTH>电影里的毒贩成了真的毒贩  是吗
<26-7,BOOTH>So the movie drug dealer becomes a drug dealer, huh?

726
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:21,830
<26-7,BOOTH>如果这是真的  是个好故事
<26-7,BOOTH>It'd be a good story if it were true.

727
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,420
<26-7,BOOTH>话虽这么说  我也没去管它
<26-7,BOOTH>That being said, I don't discourage it.

728
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:27,330
<26-7,BOOTH>毕竟一个虚构的好故事也能给人带来名声
<26-7,BOOTH>A good fiction can do wonders for one's reputation.

729
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:29,740
<26-8,CASTLE>据我所知  任何一个虚构的好故事
<26-8,CASTLE>I've learned that every good fiction

730
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:31,080
<26-8,CASTLE>都包含了一定的真实性
<26-8,CASTLE>contains a kernel of truth.

731
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,710
<26-9,BECKETT>兰斯带来的那个手提箱哪儿去了
<26-9,BECKETT>What happened to the briefcase that Lance brought

732
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:35,680
<26-9,BECKETT>装有二十万现金的箱子
<26-9,BECKETT>to the meeting, the one with $200,000 in it?

733
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:39,210
<26-10,BOOTH>兰斯没带手提箱
<26-10,BOOTH>Lance had no briefcase.

734
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:40,740
<26-11,BECKETT>我想你的手下也没有把他赶出去
<26-11,BECKETT>And I suppose your guys didn't chase him out of here

735
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:41,940
<26-11,BECKETT>并且袭击了他  对吧
<26-11,BECKETT>and then attack him?

736
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:43,500
<26-12,BOOTH>我想不起来了
<26-12,BOOTH>Doesn't ring a bell.

737
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:45,800
<26-13,CASTLE>-我们有录像  -不是我的人
<26-13,CASTLE>- We have a video. - Not of my guys.

738
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:46,840
<26-14,BOOTH>你们可以来查
<26-14,BOOTH>You're welcome to check.

739
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,580
<26-14,BOOTH>我怀疑你能在这找到他们
<26-14,BOOTH>I doubt you'll find any of them here.

740
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:50,260
<26-14,BOOTH>关于你下个问题
<26-14,BOOTH>And since your next question will be,

741
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:53,260
<26-14,BOOTH>我那晚在哪里  我来帮你省点力气
<26-14,BOOTH>"Where was I that night?" I'll save you the oxygen.

742
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:54,870
<26-14,BOOTH>楼下有20个人
<26-14,BOOTH>There are about 20 people downstairs

743
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:56,950
<26-14,BOOTH>可以为我作证  在兰斯离开后
<26-14,BOOTH>who can attest that I never left the building

744
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:58,880
<26-14,BOOTH>我没有离开过这栋楼
<26-14,BOOTH>after Lance left.

745
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:00,670
<26-14,BOOTH>我没有杀他
<26-14,BOOTH>I didn't kill him.

746
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,590
<26-15,BECKETT>好的  谢谢你抽出时间
<26-15,BECKETT>Okay. Thanks for your time.

747
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,370
<26-15,BECKETT>谢谢你抽出时间
<26-15,BECKETT>"Thanks for your time"?

748
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,450
<27-1,CASTLE>贝克特  他在撒谎  那些钱
<27-1,CASTLE>Beckett, he was lying about the money,

749
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:14,020
<27-1,CASTLE>他们的碰面  全是谎言
<27-1,CASTLE>about the meeting, about everything.

750
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,330
<27-2,BECKETT>他当然是在撒谎
<27-2,BECKETT>Of course he was lying.

751
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:18,350
<27-3,CASTLE>你怎么不强硬一点  不去查他的不在场证明吗
<27-3,CASTLE>So why didn't you push harder? Why didn't we check his alibi?

752
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:19,930
<27-4,BECKETT>因为没有必要
<27-4,BECKETT>Because we didn't need to.

753
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:21,660
<27-5,CASTLE>从什么时候开始的事
<27-5,CASTLE>Since when?

754
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,250
<27-6,BECKETT>从我知道5和2的意思开始
<27-6,BECKETT>Since I figured out what the numbers 5 and 2 meant.

755
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:26,600
<27-7,CASTLE>贴纸上缺失的数字
<27-7,CASTLE>The missing numbers from the sticker sheet.

756
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,980
<27-8,BECKETT>数字52就在布斯收藏的赛车模型上
<27-8,BECKETT>The number 52 was on a slot car in Boothe's collection --

757
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:32,140
<27-8,BECKETT>确切的说是一辆蓝色的谢尔比眼镜蛇
<27-8,BECKETT>A blue shelby cobra to be exact.

758
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,410
<27-9,CASTLE>那就是兰斯制作的东西
<27-9,CASTLE>That's what Lance was building.

759
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:35,390
<27-9,CASTLE>他把一个窃听装置
<27-9,CASTLE>He put a listening device

760
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:37,470
<27-9,CASTLE>放进了一个布斯收藏车的复制品里
<27-9,CASTLE>inside a replica of one of boothe's cars.

761
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,490
<27-10,BECKETT>他肯定是在他们碰面的时候换掉了车
<27-10,BECKETT>He must have switched them out when they had that meeting.

762
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,800
<27-10,BECKETT>也就是说那辆车记录了在那发生的一切
<27-10,BECKETT>Which means that car was recording everything

763
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,550
<27-10,BECKETT>包括兰斯在那的原因
<27-10,BECKETT>that happened in that office, including why Lance was there.

764
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:47,550
<27-11,CASTLE>还有为什么布斯要杀掉他
<27-11,CASTLE>And why Boothe had him killed.

765
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:49,370
<27-11,CASTLE>我们得拿到那个赛车模型
<27-11,CASTLE>We need to get that slot car.

766
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:51,850
<27-12,BECKETT>会的  我们只需要先拿到搜查令
<27-12,BECKETT>We will. We just need a warrant first.

767
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:55,410
<27-12,BECKETT>我不明白
<27-12,BECKETT>I don't understand.

768
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,710
<28-1,BROCK>你是说你拿不到搜查令
<28-1,BROCK>You're telling me - you can't get a search warrant,

769
00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:00,210
<28-1,BROCK>即使那个狗娘养的布斯就是凶手
<28-1,BROCK>even though that son of a bitch Boothe is behind this?

770
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:01,730
<28-2,BECKETT>除非我们能提供证据
<28-2,BECKETT>Not unless we can provide evidence

771
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:03,430
<28-2,BECKETT>证明布斯和兰斯的死有关
<28-2,BECKETT>that ties Boothe to Lance's death.

772
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:06,020
<28-2,BECKETT>而现在  我们甚至不能证明他们见过面
<28-2,BECKETT>And, right now, we can't even prove that the two of them met.

773
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:06,730
<28-2,BECKETT>听着  哈蒙先生
<28-2,BECKETT>Look, Mr. Harmon,

774
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,470
<28-2,BECKETT>我们希望你能帮助我们
<28-2,BECKETT>we were hoping that you could help us with this.

775
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:10,500
<28-2,BECKETT>兰斯跟你说过他要去那家俱乐部
<28-2,BECKETT>Did Lance tell you that he was going to the club,

776
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,520
<28-2,BECKETT>他要去见布斯吗
<28-2,BECKETT>that he was gonna talk to Boothe?

777
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,470
<28-3,BROCK>关于布斯  那家俱乐部
<28-3,BROCK>Lance never said a word to me

778
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:16,180
<28-3,BROCK>兰斯一个字都没跟我说过
<28-3,BROCK>about Boothe or the club, nothing.

779
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,040
<28-3,BROCK>该死  我还以为他在洛杉矶
<28-3,BROCK>Hell, I thought he was in L.A.

780
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:21,190
<28-3,BROCK>我也希望能够帮到你们
<28-3,BROCK>I wish I could help you.

781
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:21,960
<28-4,BECKETT>你知道吗
<28-4,BECKETT>Well, you know what?

782
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:24,070
<28-4,BECKETT>我们会继续找袭击兰斯的那群人
<28-4,BECKETT>We'll keep looking for the men that attacked Lance.

783
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,070
<28-4,BECKETT>我们不会放弃的
<28-4,BECKETT>We're not giving up.

784
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:27,950
<28-4,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<28-4,BECKETT>Castle.

785
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:33,360
<28-5,BROCK>兰斯怎么知道在赛车模型上装窃听器
<28-5,BROCK>How did Lance know to bug a slot car?

786
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,830
<28-6,CASTLE>布斯和他的收藏
<28-6,CASTLE>Boothe and his collection

787
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:38,380
<28-6,CASTLE>被刊登在了一本赛车杂志上
<28-6,CASTLE>were featured in slotzone magazine.

788
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:41,590
<28-7,BROCK>你真觉得能证明谁杀害兰斯的证据
<28-7,BROCK>So you really think the proof of who killed Lance

789
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,180
<28-7,BROCK>就在那辆小蓝色谢尔比眼镜蛇里吗
<28-7,BROCK>is sitting in that little blue shelby cobra?

790
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,630
<28-8,CASTLE>没拿到搜查令  说什么都没有用
<28-8,CASTLE>Well, doesn't matter if we can't get a warrant.

791
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:49,730
<28-8,CASTLE>真可惜这时瑞克·克鲁斯不在
<28-8,CASTLE>Too bad Rico Cruz isn't around.

792
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,310
<28-8,CASTLE>我敢肯定他能够找到办法
<28-8,CASTLE>I bet he'd find a way, right?

793
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:56,330
<28-9,BROCK>你是个铁杆粉  对吧
<28-9,BROCK>So, you, uh -- - you're a pretty big fan, huh?

794
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,570
<28-10,CASTLE>《铁血硬汉》吗
<28-10,CASTLE>Of "Hard kill"?

795
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,590
<28-10,CASTLE>不  我只是普通粉  一般粉
<28-10,CASTLE>No, I was an average, ordinary fan.

796
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,340
<28-10,CASTLE>我可没有《铁血硬汉》版睡衣
<28-10,CASTLE>Not like I had the "Hard Kill" Pajamas.

797
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,900
<28-11,BROCK>我和那帮家伙
<28-11,BROCK>Say, the, uh, gang and I

800
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:15,770
<28-11,BROCK>卡塞尔
<28-11,BROCK>Castle?

801
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:21,650
<29-1,CASTLE>你肯定猜不到刚才发生了什么
<29-1,CASTLE>You are never gonna believe what just happened.

802
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:24,120
<29-1,CASTLE>布鲁克邀我和"不倒硬汉"们喝一杯
<29-1,CASTLE>Brock invited me to go drinking with The Indestructibles.

803
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:26,760
<29-1,CASTLE>我和他们一起
<29-1,CASTLE>Me with them.

804
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:28,130
<29-2,BECKETT>那你肯定拒绝了他们对吧
<29-2,BECKETT>But you told him that you couldn't

805
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:29,830
<29-2,BECKETT>因为你现在还有案子要办
<29-2,BECKETT>because you're in the middle of a case, right?

806
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:31,740
<29-3,CASTLE>没  什么  不  我...
<29-3,CASTLE>No. What? No. I just --

808
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:35,370
<29-4,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你不会真的以为我会阻止
<29-4,BECKETT>Castle, you really think that I could stand between

809
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:36,960
<29-4,BECKETT>你实现你的儿时梦想吧
<29-4,BECKETT>you and your boyhood dream?

810
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,990
<29-5,CASTLE>你才是我的儿时梦想

<29-7,CASTLE>Well, you and drinking with The Indestructibles.

812
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,950
<29-8,BECKETT>你真的不用把这些说出来
<29-8,BECKETT>You don't always have to keep talking.

813
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:44,810
<29-10,BECKETT>-也对  -去吧
<29-10,BECKETT>- Right. - Yeah.

<29-11,CASTLE>那我去...那我去了
<29-11,CASTLE>I'm gonna -- I'm gonna go.

815
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,360
<29-13,CASTLE>我都不知道我该穿什么了
<29-13,CASTLE>I don't know what I'm gonna wear.

816
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:48,580
<29-13,CASTLE>我得赶紧准备了
<29-13,CASTLE>I got to get ready.

817
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:54,850
<29-13,CASTLE>好了
<29-13,CASTLE>All right.

818
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:56,390
<29-13,CASTLE>好了
<29-13,CASTLE>Okay.

819
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,610
<30-1,CASTLE>你们...根本不知道我有多兴奋...
<30-1,CASTLE>Well, you guys -- you have no idea how excited I am to...

820
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,120
<30-2,CASTLE>你们是直接从片场过来的吗
<30-2,CASTLE>You guys just come from set or something?

821
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,730
<30-3,BROCK>小伙子  我们是地狱来客
<30-3,BROCK>Son, we came straight from hell.

822
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:10,330
<30-3,BROCK>出发吧
<30-3,BROCK>Let's roll.

823
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:16,380
<31-1,CASTLE>那...究竟是怎么回事
<31-1,CASTLE>So, um... What's going on?

824
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:17,810
<31-2,CLAY BIGGS>没搜查令并不能阻止我们
<31-2,CLAY BIGGS>No warrant is gonna stop us

825
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:20,510
<31-2,CLAY BIGGS>拿到将杀死兰斯凶手定罪的证据
<31-2,CLAY BIGGS>from getting our hands on evidence to put away Lance's killer.

826
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:22,180
<31-3,BROCK>有人杀死了我们中的一员
<31-3,BROCK>Somebody takes out one of our own,

827
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:23,710
<31-3,BROCK>我们一定会替他报仇的
<31-3,BROCK>we take him out.

828
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:26,010
<31-4,CASTLE>伙计们
<31-4,CASTLE>Oh, guys, hey,

829
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:28,280
<31-4,CASTLE>听着  如果你们的计划是到那个俱乐部
<31-4,CASTLE>listen, if your plan is to go to the club

830
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,480
<31-4,CASTLE>偷走那个模型车
<31-4,CASTLE>and steal that slot car,

831
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,990
<31-4,CASTLE>那可不行  那会...那会玷污证据的
<31-4,CASTLE>N-no. That would -- that would taint the evidence.

832
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,430
<31-5,ROLF MAGNUS>实际上  我们可以强迫检察官接受这个证物
<31-5,ROLF MAGNUS>Actually, we can compel the D.A. to consider it

833
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:37,440
<31-5,ROLF MAGNUS>因为那车本来就是被害人兰斯的
<31-5,ROLF MAGNUS>since the car technically belonged to the victim, Lance.

834
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,460
<31-6,CASTLE>你真的是天才啊
<31-6,CASTLE>You really are a genius, aren't you?

835
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,640
<31-7,ROLF>另外  我们都不是执法人员
<31-7,ROLF>Also, none of us is an agent of the law.

836
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:43,260
<31-8,BROCK>这也是我们挑选你的原因
<31-8,BROCK>It's one of the reasons I chose you.

837
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,250
<31-9,SERAFINA>还因为你去过布斯的办公室
<31-9,SERAFINA>And because you have been in Boothe's office.

838
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:48,610
<31-10,BROCK>得靠你帮我们找到那辆模型车
<31-10,BROCK>You're gonna help us find that slot car.

839
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:50,920
<31-11,CASTLE>不  不  不不不
<31-11,CASTLE>No. No. No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

840
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,040
<31-11,CASTLE>伙计们  我老婆是个警察
<31-11,CASTLE>Guys, my wife is a cop.

841
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,300
<31-11,CASTLE>如果我这么做了  她会杀了我的
<31-11,CASTLE>If I do this, she'll kill me.

842
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,930
<31-12,BROCK>"我的老婆会杀了我的"
<31-12,BROCK>"Oh, my wife's gonna kill me."

843
00:31:56,930 --> 00:31:58,430
<31-12,BROCK>这像是瑞克·克鲁斯说的话吗
<31-12,BROCK>Is that what Rico Cruz would say?

844
00:31:58,430 --> 00:31:59,360
<31-12,BROCK>不像
<31-12,BROCK>No.

845
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:02,330
<31-13,CASTLE>-如果被抓到怎么办  -不会被抓到的
<31-13,CASTLE>- But what if we get caught? - We're not gonna get caught.

846
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:04,470
<31-13,CASTLE>我们是"不倒硬汉"
<31-13,CASTLE>We're The Indestructibles.

847
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:07,570
<31-14,BROCK>打起精神  伙计们  好戏要上场了
<31-14,BROCK>Tense up, guys. It's showtime.

848
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:25,590
<32-1,BROCK>计划很简单
<32-1,BROCK>The plan is simple.

849
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:29,140
<32-1,BROCK>一进俱乐部  塞拉菲纳  克雷  洛夫
<32-1,BROCK>Once we get to the club, Serafina, Clay, Rolf,

850
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:31,890
<32-1,BROCK>你们就从正门进去然后各就各位
<32-1,BROCK>go in through the main entrance and take your positions.

851
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:39,620
<32-2,BROCK>塞拉菲纳  找到后门之后通知我们
<32-2,BROCK>Serafina, alert us when you have eyes on the rear door.

852
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:42,310
<32-3,SERAFINA>老鹰回巢了
<32-3,SERAFINA>Falcon is in the nest.

853
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:47,040
<32-4,BROCK>克雷  你和洛夫想办法把布斯骗到下面吧台来
<32-4,BROCK>Clay, you and Rolf create a diversion to draw Boothe down to the bar.

854
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,360
<32-5,CLAY>小伙计  小伙计

<32-7,CLAY>如果你知道我们是谁
<32-7,CLAY>If you know who we are,

859
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,510
<32-7,CLAY>就该知道我们从里根当总统那时起就不付酒钱了
<32-7,CLAY>then you know we haven't paid for a drink since Reagan.

860
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:58,510
<32-8,BARTENDER>先生  "天使"可是一千一瓶
<32-8,BARTENDER>Sir, Angel is a grand a bottle.

<32-9,ROLF>小子  我们是来缅怀逝去战友的
<32-9,ROLF>Son, we're here to toast a fallen comrade.

863
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,130
<32-9,ROLF>难道过气的布斯太小气  不愿表示悼念吗
<32-9,ROLF>That has-been Boothe too cheap to pay respects?

864
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:11,590
<32-11,BOOTH>-布斯先生  -什么事
<32-11,BOOTH>- Mr. Boothe? - Yeah?

<36-2,BROCK>You're telling me that

892
00:34:56,890 --> 00:35:00,240
<37-1,BECKETT>这是一位"热心的公民"交给你的
<37-1,BECKETT>this was handed to you by a "concerned citizen"?

893
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,050
<37-2,CASTLE>是的

<37-4,CASTLE>This is probably one of those times

896
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:09,070
<37-4,CASTLE>我该住嘴的时候
<37-4,CASTLE>where I shouldn't keep talking,

897
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:10,000
<37-4,CASTLE>这是为了我们好
<37-4,CASTLE>for both our sakes.

898
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:13,760
<37-4,CASTLE>接下来你将听到的录音
<37-4,CASTLE>The recording you are about to hear

899
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,870
<38-1,CASTLE>会提供无可争议的证据证明

900
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:20,490
<38-1,CASTLE>亨利·艾伦·布斯是谋害兰斯·德鲁卡的幕后主谋
<38-1,CASTLE>that Henry Allen Boothe ordered the murder of Lance Delorca.

00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,510
<38-2,CASTLE>没有声音
<38-2,CASTLE>Sound's not working.

902
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:26,460
<38-2,CASTLE>稍等一下  这是...
<38-2,CASTLE>Hang on a second. This was...

903
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:32,800
<38-3,CASTLE>耳机  你为什么不让我也听听
<38-3,CASTLE>Headphones? Aren't you gonna let me hear it?

904
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:35,070
<38-4,BECKETT>作为你半违法行为的奖励吗
<38-4,BECKETT>And reward you for your semi-illegal behavior?

905
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:35,900
<38-4,BECKETT>我看还是算了
<38-4,BECKETT>I think not.

906
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:36,450
<38-4,BECKETT>我...
<38-4,BECKETT>I...

907
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,190
<38-5,CASTLE>好吧  我来把它弄到功放上
<38-5,CASTLE>Fine, I'll put it on speaker.

908
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:39,690
<38-6,CASTLE>不是吧
<38-6,CASTLE>Seriously?

909
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:41,600
<38-6,CASTLE>要不是因为我  我们根本不会...
<38-6,CASTLE>Because if it wasn't for me, we wouldn't even...

910
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,000
<38-7,CASTLE>怎么了
<38-7,CASTLE>What?

911
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,620
<38-8,BECKETT>兰斯刚走进布斯的办公室
<38-8,BECKETT>Lance just walked in to Boothe's office.

912
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:46,050
<38-8,BECKETT>他们在互相寒暄
<38-8,BECKETT>They're exchanging pleasantries.

913
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,890
<38-8,BECKETT>现在要开始说正事了
<38-8,BECKETT>And they're getting down to business.

914
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,560
<38-8,BECKETT>我的天
<38-8,BECKETT>Oh, my god.

915
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:53,190
<38-9,CASTLE>怎么了
<38-9,CASTLE>What is it?

916
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:55,480
<38-10,BECKETT>-我的天  -他到底在说什么
<38-10,BECKETT>- Oh, my god. - What is he saying?

917
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:56,700
<38-11,CASTLE>求你了快告诉我他们在说什么
<38-11,CASTLE>Please, just tell me what they're saying.

918
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,760
<38-12,BECKETT>这和我想的完全不同
<38-12,BECKETT>This is so not what I expected.

919
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:00,470
<38-12,BECKETT>我的天
<38-12,BECKETT>Oh, my god.

920
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:04,690
<39-1,TREY>这是怎么回事
<39-1,TREY>So, what's this about?

921
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:07,530
<39-2,BECKETT>特雷  你有多了解亨利·艾伦·布斯
<39-2,BECKETT>Trey, how well do you know Henry Allen Boothe?

922
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,060
<39-3,TREY>如果有人拥有一家俱乐部
<39-3,TREY>Well, if someone owns a club,

923
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,610
<39-3,TREY>那我的职责就是去认识他
<39-3,TREY>it's my job to know them.

924
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:11,840
<39-3,TREY>我是通过我父亲认识的
<39-3,TREY>I met him through my dad.

925
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:13,250
<39-3,TREY>他们一起拍过一些电影
<39-3,TREY>They did a few movies together.

926
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:15,160
<39-4,CASTLE>事实上  布斯给了你些本钱
<39-4,CASTLE>In fact, Boothe invested some seed money

927
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,080
<39-4,CASTLE>这样你才能成为夜店推手
<39-4,CASTLE>so you could become a club promoter.

928
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:18,070
<39-5,BECKETT>作为一名推手
<39-5,BECKETT>Then, as a promoter,

929
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:20,240
<39-5,BECKETT>你就能随意进出全市所有俱乐部
<39-5,BECKETT>you had access to all the clubs in the city.

930
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,430
<39-5,BECKETT>布斯利用这一点
<39-5,BECKETT>Boothe used that access

931
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:23,360
<39-5,BECKETT>在那些俱乐部里贩卖毒品
<39-5,BECKETT>to sell drugs in those clubs,

932
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,980
<39-5,BECKETT>至少缉毒队是这么告诉我们的
<39-5,BECKETT>or so we're told by narcotics.

933
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:28,880
<39-6,BECKETT>你似乎并不否认这个  特雷
<39-6,BECKETT>I don't hear you denying this, Trey.

934
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,800
<39-7,TREY>我一开始并不知道毒品的事情
<39-7,TREY>I didn't know about the drugs at first,

935
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,440
<39-7,TREY>等我知道以后  已经太晚了
<39-7,TREY>and once I did, it was too late.

936
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,470
<39-7,TREY>-他控制了我  -让我猜猜
<39-7,TREY>- He owned me. - Let me guess.

937
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:39,420
<39-8,CASTLE>布斯说你可以一次性买断
<39-8,CASTLE>Boothe said you could buy him out,

938
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:41,460
<39-8,CASTLE>但他知道你付不起那个价
<39-8,CASTLE>but at a price he knew you could never afford.

939
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,130
<39-8,CASTLE>他开价多少  二十万吗
<39-8,CASTLE>What was it? $200,000?

940
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:47,070
<39-9,BECKETT>你没跟你的父母讲这件事  对吧
<39-9,BECKETT>You didn't tell your parents about any of this, did you?

941
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:48,690
<39-10,TREY>我想自己想办法
<39-10,TREY>I wanted to make my own way,

942
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:52,170
<39-10,TREY>而不是求助于布鲁克·哈蒙
<39-10,TREY>not have Brock Harmon come to the rescue.

943
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,580
<39-11,CASTLE>但被兰斯知道了
<39-11,CASTLE>But Lance found out.

944
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:57,140
<39-11,CASTLE>他想买断布斯  赎回你的自由
<39-11,CASTLE>He tried to buy out Boothe, pay your ransom,

945
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:59,750
<39-11,CASTLE>就像瑞克·克鲁斯在《铁胆硬汉》里那样
<39-11,CASTLE>just like Rico Cruz did in "Hard Kill".

946
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,750
<39-12,TREY>我求他不要这么做
<39-12,TREY>Yeah, and I begged him not to.

947
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:03,520
<39-12,TREY>这又不是在演电影
<39-12,TREY>This wasn't some movie.

948
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:05,880
<39-12,TREY>我知道布斯是不会放过我的
<39-12,TREY>I knew that Boothe wasn't gonna let me go,

949
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,080
<39-12,TREY>兰斯也无法拿着一带钱跑去
<39-12,TREY>and Lance couldn't just walk in there with a bag of money

950
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,300
<39-12,TREY>就把事情解决了
<39-12,TREY>and fix things.

951
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,310
<39-12,TREY>但是  突然间  他想当英雄
<39-12,TREY>But, suddenly, he wanted to be a hero.

952
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:12,970
<39-12,TREY>我跟他说  他会把我们俩都害死的
<39-12,TREY>I told him he was gonna get us both killed.

953
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:15,830
<39-13,CASTLE>但他为了救你只赔上了自己的性命
<39-13,CASTLE>But he only got himself killed trying to save you.

954
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,710
<39-14,BECKETT>我们录下了布斯当晚说的话
<39-14,BECKETT>We have an audio recording of Boothe from that night.

955
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:21,410
<39-15,TREY>怎么录到的
<39-15,TREY>How?

956
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,870
<39-16,CASTLE>兰斯在他办公室里装了窃听器
<39-16,CASTLE>Lance bugged his office.

957
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:25,250
<39-17,BECKETT>布斯把兰斯赶出自己的办公室后
<39-17,BECKETT>After Boothe kicked Lance out of his office,

958
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:26,570
<39-17,BECKETT>派了自己的手下去干掉他
<39-17,BECKETT>he sent his men after him.

959
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:29,580
<39-18,CASTLE>兰斯像动作片英雄一样海扁了他们
<39-18,CASTLE>Lance gave them a beatdown worthy of an action hero.

960
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:32,320
<39-18,CASTLE>这时  布斯打了一通电话
<39-18,CASTLE>That's when Boothe made this phone call.

961
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:36,330
<39-19,BOOTH>特雷  你哥们兰斯来过
<39-19,BOOTH>Trey, your pal Lance was here.

962
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:37,930
<39-19,BOOTH>我想你知道原因
<39-19,BOOTH>I think you know why.

963
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,120
<39-19,BOOTH>他现在在那家
<39-19,BOOTH>He's on the run somewhere

964
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,950
<39-19,BOOTH>上映《铁胆硬汉》的剧院附近
<39-19,BOOTH>near that theater playing "Hard Kill".

965
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:42,310
<39-19,BOOTH>接下来交给你了
<39-19,BOOTH>He's your problem now.

966
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:45,390
<39-19,BOOTH>你必须收拾他作为赔罪
<39-19,BOOTH>You need to take care of him to make this right,

967
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:47,140
<39-19,BOOTH>不然我就收拾你
<39-19,BOOTH>or I'll take care of you.

968
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:51,430
<39-19,BOOTH>就这样  特雷  去吧
<39-19,BOOTH>You do that, Trey. Get it...done.

969
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:55,660
<39-20,BECKETT>你怕布斯怕得要命  所以你杀了兰斯
<39-20,BECKETT>You were so afraid of Boothe that you killed Lance

970
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:57,310
<39-20,BECKETT>来保自己的小命
<39-20,BECKETT>in order to save your own skin.

971
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:58,270
<39-21,TREY>我才不会这么做呢
<39-21,TREY>I would never do that.

972
00:37:58,270 --> 00:38:00,520
<39-22,BECKETT>听起来你正是这么做的
<39-22,BECKETT>It sounds like that's exactly what you did do.

973
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,130
<39-22,BECKETT>你挂电话之后呢
<39-22,BECKETT>Now, what happened after you hung up?

974
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:03,920
<39-23,TREY>我吓傻了
<39-23,TREY>I freaked.

975
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:07,840
<39-23,TREY>我打电话给我母亲  把事情都告诉她了
<39-23,TREY>I called my mom, told her everything,

976
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:09,020
<39-23,TREY>来龙去脉都说了
<39-23,TREY>the whole story.

977
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,810
<39-23,TREY>她叫我躲一躲  她会联系律师
<39-23,TREY>She said to lay low, that she'd call a lawyer.

978
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,780
<39-23,TREY>然后第二天早上  兰斯就死了
<39-23,TREY>And then, the next morning, Lance was dead.

979
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:17,390
<39-23,TREY>我以为他是被布斯的人干掉了
<39-23,TREY>I figured Boothe's guys got to him.

980
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,560
<39-23,TREY>我整晚都在我办公室
<39-23,TREY>Look, I was at my office all night.

981
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:23,240
<39-23,TREY>我睡在那了  清洁人员看到我了
<39-23,TREY>I slept there. The cleaning crew saw me.

982
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,720
<39-23,TREY>我发誓我没杀兰斯
<39-23,TREY>I swear to you I did not kill Lance.

983
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:27,940
<39-23,TREY>我也不知道是谁干的
<39-23,TREY>And I don't know who did.

984
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,300
<39-24,CASTLE>告诉我  特雷
<39-24,CASTLE>Tell me, Trey --

985
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,210
<39-24,CASTLE>兰斯为什么要费这么大劲帮你呢
<39-24,CASTLE>why would Lance go through all this trouble to help you?

986
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:36,010
<39-24,CASTLE>我不知道
<39-24,CASTLE>I don't know.

987
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:41,470
<39-25,TREY>他只是说癌症让他醒悟了
<39-25,TREY>He just said that the cancer really woke him up

988
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:44,190
<39-25,TREY>他说等这一切结束了
<39-25,TREY>and that, uh, after all this was over,

989
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:46,880
<39-25,TREY>他要告诉我一些事
<39-25,TREY>there were some things that he wanted to tell me.

990
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:52,940
<40-1,BECKETT>清洁人员证实了特雷的说法
<40-1,BECKETT>So, the cleaning crew confirmed Trey's story.

991
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:54,930
<40-1,BECKETT>他不是凶手
<40-1,BECKETT>He is not our killer.

992
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:56,310
<40-2,CASTLE>也许是布斯的一个手下干的
<40-2,CASTLE>Maybe it was one of Boothe's men.

993
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:57,500
<40-2,CASTLE>我们还没排除他们的嫌疑
<40-2,CASTLE>We still haven't ruled them out.

994
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,330
<40-3,RYAN>伙计们
<40-3,RYAN>Hey, guys.

995
00:38:58,460 --> 00:38:59,830
<40-3,RYAN>我发现了一件很有意思的事
<40-3,RYAN>I just found something very interesting.

996
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:01,010
<40-4,CASTLE>凶手的身份
<40-4,CASTLE>The identity of the killer.

997
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:01,700
<40-5,RYAN>不  不是
<40-5,RYAN>No, not that.

998
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:04,640
<40-5,RYAN>你们记得特雷说癌症让兰斯醒悟了
<40-5,RYAN>You know how Trey said that Lance's cancer woke him up?

999
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,210
<40-5,RYAN>我刚跟他的医生谈完
<40-5,RYAN>Well, I just spoke to his doctor.

1000
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:08,210
<40-5,RYAN>兰斯拿到骨髓捐赠者名字时  他想感谢人家
<40-5,RYAN>When Lance got the name of his bone-marrow donor

1001
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:10,630
<40-5,RYAN>他发现和他骨髓配型结果非常相近的
<40-5,RYAN>to thank him, he found out there was a second donor

1002
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:12,280
<40-5,RYAN>还有另一位捐赠者
<40-5,RYAN>who was a very close match.

1003
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:13,390
<40-5,RYAN>看看那个名字
<40-5,RYAN>Take a look at that name.

1004
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:24,180
<41-1,NAOMI>你们把特雷放了吗
<41-1,NAOMI>Have you released Trey yet?

1005
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:26,030
<41-1,NAOMI>他跟这件事没关系
<41-1,NAOMI>He had nothing to do with this.

1006
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:28,600
<41-2,BECKETT>实际上  所有这一切都跟特雷有关
<41-2,BECKETT>Actually, Trey has everything to do with this.

1007
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:30,120
<41-3,NAOMI>我好像不太明白
<41-3,NAOMI>I'm not sure I understand.

1008
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:32,480
<41-4,BECKETT>当兰斯需要骨髓移植
<41-4,BECKETT>When Lance needed a bone-marrow transplant,

1009
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,450
<41-4,BECKETT>特雷也捐献了样本看自己是否匹配
<41-4,BECKETT>Trey gave a sample to see if he could donate.

1010
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:36,380
<41-5,NAOMI>我们都给了  那是我们最起码应该做的
<41-5,NAOMI>We all did. It was the least we could do.

1011
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:39,410
<41-6,BECKETT>只不过特雷的样本几乎完全匹配
<41-6,BECKETT>Except Trey's sample was nearly a match.

1012
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:40,710
<41-6,BECKETT>兰斯肯定也有所怀疑
<41-6,BECKETT>Lance must have had his suspicions

1013
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:43,340
<41-6,BECKETT>因为他用那个样本做了亲子鉴定
<41-6,BECKETT>because he ran a paternity test on that sample.

1014
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:45,630
<41-7,CASTLE>特雷是他的儿子
<41-7,CASTLE>Trey was his son.

1015
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,430
<41-7,CASTLE>不
<41-7,CASTLE>No.

1016
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:48,110
<41-8,CASTLE>特雷应该是在
<41-8,CASTLE>He would have been conceived

1017
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:49,660
<41-8,CASTLE>拍《铁胆硬汉》时怀上的
<41-8,CASTLE>during the filming of "Hard Kill",

1018
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:51,280
<41-8,CASTLE>这还真是麻烦
<41-8,CASTLE>which is inconvenient,

1019
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,930
<41-8,CASTLE>因为那时你已经嫁给了布鲁克
<41-8,CASTLE>since you were already married to Brock.

1020
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,940
<41-9,BECKETT>我们跟你的门房纳奥米谈过
<41-9,BECKETT>We spoke to your doorman, Naomi.

1021
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:56,030
<41-9,BECKETT>他说兰斯被杀当晚
<41-9,BECKETT>He said that you didn't come home

1022
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:58,210
<41-9,BECKETT>你过了后半夜才回家
<41-9,BECKETT>until well after midnight the night that Lance was killed,

1023
00:39:58,210 --> 00:39:59,230
<41-9,BECKETT>你去哪了
<41-9,BECKETT>so where were you?

1024
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:02,540
<41-10,NAOMI>我没杀兰斯  如果你是这个意思的话
<41-10,NAOMI>I didn't kill Lance, if that's what you're suggesting.

1025
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:03,980
<41-11,CASTLE>你完全有这个本事
<41-11,CASTLE>You're more than capable of it.

1026
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:05,660
<41-11,CASTLE>你不仅回旋踢很厉害
<41-11,CASTLE>You don't just have a mean roundhouse.

1027
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:07,300
<41-11,CASTLE>你还有两个黑带
<41-11,CASTLE>You hold two black belts.

1028
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,900
<41-12,NAOMI>够了  你们该走了
<41-12,NAOMI>Okay, you need to leave.

1029
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:10,160
<41-13,BECKETT>我们找到了凶器
<41-13,BECKETT>We matched the wire.

1030
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:12,870
<41-13,BECKETT>你在你珠宝品牌中使用的串线
<41-13,BECKETT>The wire that you use for your jewelry line,

1031
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:14,600
<41-13,BECKETT>跟你现在戴的项链一样
<41-13,BECKETT>like the necklace that you're wearing right now --

1032
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,620
<41-13,BECKETT>跟我们的凶器完全吻合
<41-13,BECKETT>it's an exact match to our murder weapon.

1033
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:17,670
<41-14,CASTLE>特雷跟你说
<41-14,CASTLE>Trey told you

1034
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:19,940
<41-14,CASTLE>兰斯有重要的事情要告诉他
<41-14,CASTLE>that Lance had something important to tell him.

1035
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:21,370
<41-14,CASTLE>你知道真相即将暴露
<41-14,CASTLE>You knew the truth would come out.

1036
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,550
<41-15,NAOMI>兰斯会毁掉一切的
<41-15,NAOMI>Lance would have destroyed everything --

1037
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,660
<41-15,NAOMI>我的婚姻  我的家庭
<41-15,NAOMI>my marriage, my family,

1038
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:32,550
<41-15,NAOMI>我花了近30年时间建立的一切
<41-15,NAOMI>everything that I spent almost 30 years trying to build.

1039
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,680
<41-15,NAOMI>我不能让他这么做
<41-15,NAOMI>I couldn't let him do that.

1040
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:41,180
<41-16,BROCK>怎么回事
<41-16,BROCK>What's going on?

1041
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:45,210
<42-1,GATES>告诉你们一件事  亨利·艾伦·布斯
<42-1,GATES>You might be interested to know that Henry Allen Boothe

1042
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:47,430
<42-1,GATES>已被缉毒科逮捕了
<42-1,GATES>was just arrested by narcotics.

1043
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:49,250
<42-2,BECKETT>他们不是无法立案吗
<42-2,BECKETT>I thought they couldn't make a case.

1044
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:51,440
<42-3,GATES>之前是不行  可是当特雷知道
<42-3,GATES>Well, they couldn't, but when Trey learned the truth

1045
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,230
<42-3,GATES>兰斯这么做的真相后
<42-3,GATES>about why Lance really did all this,

1046
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:56,430
<42-3,GATES>他站了出来  决定要指证布斯
<42-3,GATES>he stepped up and decided to testify against Boothe.

1047
00:40:56,890 --> 00:41:00,500
<42-3,GATES>干得好  贝克特警探  卡塞尔先生
<42-3,GATES>So good work, Detective Beckett, Mr. Castle.

1048
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:01,370
<42-4,GATES>别工作得太晚
<42-4,GATES>Don't stay late.

1049
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:03,030
<42-4,GATES>剩下的文书工作可以明早再弄
<42-4,GATES>You can finish the paperwork in the morning.

1050
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:03,960
<42-5,BECKETT>谢谢长官
<42-5,BECKETT>Thank you, sir.

1051
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:08,420
<42-6,CASTLE>看来兰斯最后还是成功战胜了他的宿敌
<42-6,CASTLE>Looks like Lance managed to vanquish his nemesis after all.

1052
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:10,520
<42-6,CASTLE>这作为结局也不错了
<42-6,CASTLE>An ending worthy of one of his movies.

1053
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:11,330
<42-6,CASTLE>你知道吗
<42-6,CASTLE>You know...

1054
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:14,410
<42-7,BECKETT>也许我们今晚该看看《铁胆硬汉》
<42-7,BECKETT>maybe we should watch "Hard Kill" tonight...

1055
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,060
<42-8,BECKETT>以表悼念
<42-8,BECKETT>in his honor.

1056
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:17,890
<42-9,CASTLE>我也想这么说呢
<42-9,CASTLE>I was just gonna suggest the exact same thing.

1057
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:19,060
<42-9,CASTLE>咱们现在想法都一样了
<42-9,CASTLE>We're starting to think alike now.

1058
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:22,470
<42-10,BECKETT>这太吓人了  好吧  你去准备电影吧
<42-10,BECKETT>That is horrifying. Okay, uh, go cue up the movie.

1059
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:24,460
<42-10,BECKETT>开瓶红酒  我一会就到家
<42-10,BECKETT>Open up a bottle of wine. I'll be home in a bit.

1060
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:26,620
<42-10,BECKETT>我得先去个地方
<42-10,BECKETT>I've just got a stop to make first.

1061
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:28,520
<42-11,CASTLE>如果咱俩想得真一样的话
<42-11,CASTLE>Well, if I'm thinking what you're thinking --

1062
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,730
<42-11,CASTLE>你是去买一套性感的考古学家服饰
<42-11,CASTLE>and it's to pick up a sexy archaeologist costume --

1063
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:31,590
<42-11,CASTLE>别担心
<42-11,CASTLE>don't worry.

1064
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:33,330
<42-11,CASTLE>我已经买好鞭子了
<42-11,CASTLE>I've already got the whip.

1065
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,330
<42-11,CASTLE>谢谢
<42-11,CASTLE>Thank you.
