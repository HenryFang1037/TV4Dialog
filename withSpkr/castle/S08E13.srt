4
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:20,140
<1-1,EDDIE RAMIREZ>晚安  好梦
<1-1,EDDIE RAMIREZ>Good night and sweet dreams.

5
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:38,060
<1-2,EDDIE>小家伙  你怎么跑出来的
<1-2,EDDIE>Pequeno, how you got out of cage, yeah?

10
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:55,520
<2-1,RICHARD CASTLE>停下  停下
<2-1,RICHARD CASTLE>Stop it, stop it, stop!

12
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,420
<2-2,KATE BECKETT>你在吼谁呢
<2-2,KATE BECKETT>Uh... who are you yelling at?

13
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:01,340
<2-3,CASTLE>没谁  我就是写作卡住了
<2-3,CASTLE>No one. I just...still have writer's block. That's all.

15
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,490
<2-4,BECKETT>所以拿笔记本撒气吗
<2-4,BECKETT>So, you're taking it out on your laptop?

16
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:06,310
<2-5,CASTLE>不是  笔记本  是光标
<2-5,CASTLE>No, not the laptop. The -- That cursor.

18
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:09,020
<2-5,CASTLE>看它啊  在嘲笑我
<2-5,CASTLE>Just look at it there, taunting me,

19
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:10,820
<2-5,CASTLE>就那么一闪一灭的
<2-5,CASTLE>just blinking on, off, on, off,

21
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,550
<2-5,CASTLE>好像写畅销小说是什么简单的事
<2-5,CASTLE>like it's so easy writing a best-selling novel.

22
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:15,580
<2-5,CASTLE>你倒是试试看啊  光标先生
<2-5,CASTLE>'Cause I'd like to see you try it, Mr. Cursor!

23
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:17,170
<2-5,CASTLE>你倒是试试看啊  我们...
<2-5,CASTLE>I'd like to see you try it! So why don't we --

24
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:20,560
<2-6,BECKETT>这样吧  还是跟光标先生再见吧
<2-6,BECKETT>You know what? Why don't we just say goodbye to Mr. Cursor?

25
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,580
<2-6,BECKETT>这是什么  粉丝邮件吗
<2-6,BECKETT>What is this, fan mail?

26
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:24,770
<2-7,CASTLE>不是
<2-7,CASTLE>Oh, not exactly.

27
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:26,200
<2-7,CASTLE>还记得我前一阵曾上
<2-7,CASTLE>Remember I went on "Good Morning America"

28
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,290
<2-7,CASTLE>《早安美国》悬赏征集
<2-7,CASTLE>a while back and offered a reward for proof

29
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:29,800
<2-7,CASTLE>关于我失踪八周内
<2-7,CASTLE>of anyone who knew what happened to me

30
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,910
<2-7,CASTLE>究竟发生了什么的信息
<2-7,CASTLE>during those eight weeks I disappeared?

31
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:33,300
<2-8,BECKETT>但卡塞尔  这些信都是一年前的了
<2-8,BECKETT>But, Castle, those letters are over a year old,

32
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,050
<2-8,BECKETT>我们已经证明
<2-8,BECKETT>and we've already proven

33
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:35,360
<2-8,BECKETT>那些理论都是荒谬的
<2-8,BECKETT>that all the theories were ridiculous.

34
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,480
<2-8,BECKETT>你为什么又要重读
<2-8,BECKETT>Why are you re-reading them?

35
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,130
<2-9,CASTLE>想激发灵感啊
<2-9,CASTLE>Looking to spark my imagination.

36
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:41,210
<2-9,CASTLE>老实说  这些信都没什么创意
<2-9,CASTLE>But, honestly, these letters are not very inventive.

37
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:42,720
<2-9,CASTLE>要么是说我是被
<2-9,CASTLE>They all either claim I was a victim of

38
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,210
<2-9,CASTLE>政府阴谋迫害  就是被外星人绑架被"探测"了
<2-9,CASTLE>a government conspiracy or abducted by aliens and probed.

39
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:49,450
<2-9,CASTLE>这人还画了张我被ET外星人侵犯的示意图
<2-9,CASTLE>This guy even drew a diagram of me being violated by E.T.

40
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:52,390
<2-11,CASTLE>我需要灵感  贝克特
<2-11,CASTLE>I need inspiration, Beckett,

41
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:55,790
<2-11,CASTLE>尽管莱斯特对外星人解剖学的了解可圈可点
<2-11,CASTLE>and although Lester's knowledge of alien anatomy is commendable,

42
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,440
<2-11,CASTLE>但这不够
<2-11,CASTLE>it is just not enough.

43
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,800
<2-11,CASTLE>抱歉  稍等
<2-11,CASTLE>Sorry. One second.

45
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,490
<2-12,BECKETT>好吧  好的  我就到
<2-12,BECKETT>Okay. All right. I will be right there.

46
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:09,920
<2-12,BECKETT>你知道我也想带你去的
<2-12,BECKETT>You know that I would love to take you, but --

47
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,690
<2-13,CASTLE>但我们得继续假装分居
<2-13,CASTLE>But we have to maintain the ruse of our separation

48
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:13,790
<2-13,CASTLE>直到你抓到洛克塞特
<2-13,CASTLE>until you capture LokSat.

49
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:14,880
<2-13,CASTLE>我知道  只是
<2-13,CASTLE>I know. I know. I just --

50
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,990
<2-13,CASTLE>离了我的缪斯  我要写什么好啊  贝克特
<2-13,CASTLE>What am I supposed to write about without my muse, Beckett?

51
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,670
<2-13,CASTLE>我需要你  我是离了华生的夏洛克
<2-13,CASTLE>I need you. I-I'm Sherlock without Watson.

52
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:22,450
<2-14,BECKETT>不对  你是说没有夏洛克的华生吧
<2-14,BECKETT>No, you probably mean Watson without your Sherlock

53
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:25,740
<2-14,BECKETT>因毕竟  亲爱的  你才是作家
<2-14,BECKETT>Because, after all, my darling, you're the writer.

54
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,450
<2-14,BECKETT>好了  回见
<2-14,BECKETT>Okay. I'll see you.

55
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:28,860
<2-14,BECKETT>这样吧
<2-14,BECKETT>Uh, you know what?

56
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,480
<2-14,BECKETT>既然你这么想找案子来破
<2-14,BECKETT>Why don't you just go to your P.I. Office

57
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,320
<2-14,BECKETT>可以去你的私家侦探办公室
<2-14,BECKETT>if you're so desperate for a case to solve?

58
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,130
<2-14,BECKETT>或许阿丽克西斯和海莉
<2-14,BECKETT>Maybe Alexis and Hayley have something

59
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:36,600
<2-14,BECKETT>有能激发灵感的东西
<2-14,BECKETT>that's worthy of... inspiration.

60
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,680
<3-1,BECKETT>早啊  莱恩
<3-1,BECKETT>Good morning, Ryan.

61
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,740
<3-3,BECKETT>我看到了外面破碎的门
<3-3,BECKETT>So, I, uh, saw the broken door outside.

62
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,520
<3-3,BECKETT>-抢劫升级吗  -应该不是
<3-3,BECKETT>- Robbery gone wrong? - No, we don't think so.

63
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,100
<3-4,RYAN>据动物园管理人员说
<3-4,RYAN>According to the zoo supervisor,

64
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,830
<3-4,RYAN>动物都在
<3-4,RYAN>all the animals are accounted for.

65
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:52,910
<3-5,BECKETT>那是蛇钩吗
<3-5,BECKETT>Is that a snake hook?

66
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:55,510
<3-6,ESPOSITO>是的  看来被害人是被用这个打死的
<3-6,ESPOSITO>Yep. Looks like our victim was bludgeoned to death with it.

67
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:57,200
<3-7,BECKETT>好吧  被害人是谁
<3-7,BECKETT>Okay. Who's the victim?

68
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,060
<3-8,ESPOSITO>我们还不能完全肯定
<3-8,ESPOSITO>Uh, we're not 100% sure yet.

69
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:03,440
<3-9,RYAN>动物园管理人员觉得应该是埃迪·拉米雷斯
<3-9,RYAN>The zoo supervisor thinks that it's Eddie Ramirez,

70
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,770
<3-9,RYAN>夜间动物看管人
<3-9,RYAN>the nighttime animal caretaker.

71
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:06,880
<3-9,RYAN>如果是  那么他是一名在美国
<3-9,RYAN>If it is, then he's an El Salvador native

72
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,400
<3-9,RYAN>住了五年的萨尔瓦多移民
<3-9,RYAN>who's lived in the States for the past few years --

73
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,240
<3-10,BECKETT>等等  倒回去
<3-10,BECKETT>Yeah, I'm sorry. Uh, can we go back?

74
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,840
<3-10,BECKETT>为什么无法确认被害人的身份
<3-10,BECKETT>Why are you having trouble I.D.ing the victim?

75
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,550
<3-11,ESPOSITO>我们尚不能确认被害人的身份
<3-11,ESPOSITO>We can't positively I.D. the victim yet

76
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:19,520
<3-11,ESPOSITO>因为凶手把他的尸体丢进了
<3-11,ESPOSITO>because the killer tossed his body into --

77
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,190
<3-12,ME SIDNEY PERLMUTTER>满是致命毒蛇的坑里
<3-12,ME SIDNEY PERLMUTTER>A pit filled with deadly snakes.

78
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,120
<3-13,BECKETT>好吧  这真是没见过
<3-13,BECKETT>Okay. Well, that's a first.

<4-2,ALEXIS CASTLE>Oh, yay. Now go file these.

81
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,460
<4-3,CASTLE>看来生意不错
<4-3,CASTLE>Well, I take it business has been good.

82
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,100
<4-4,HAYLEY SHIPTON>我们现在在查三起案子呢
<4-4,HAYLEY SHIPTON>Yeah, we're working on three cases right now.

83
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,620
<4-4,HAYLEY SHIPTON>企业渎职案  保险诈骗
<4-4,HAYLEY SHIPTON>Got a corporate malfeasance, an insurance fraud,

00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,440

<4-5,CASTLE>知道这三起案子有什么共同点吗
<4-5,CASTLE>You know what all three of those cases have in common?

86
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:49,500
<4-5,CASTLE>都好无聊  拜托
<4-5,CASTLE>They are all incredibly boring. You guys, come on!

87
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,290
<4-5,CASTLE>-你们什么时候开始放低身段了  -什么
<4-5,CASTLE>- When did you sell out? - Excuse me?

88
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:52,740
<4-7,HAYLEY>里克  你想说的  应该是
<4-7,HAYLEY>I think what you meant to say, Rick, was,

89
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:55,590
<4-7,HAYLEY>"多谢了  二位女士  把我的坑钱爱好
<4-7,HAYLEY>"Thank you so much, ladies, for taking my money pit of a hobby

<4-7,HAYLEY>变成了盈利的生意"
<4-7,HAYLEY>and making it into a profitable business."

91
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:59,320
<4-8,CASTLE>我开这地方不是为了挣钱
<4-8,CASTLE>I didn't open this place to make money.

92
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,380
<4-8,CASTLE>而是为了令人激动的案子
<4-8,CASTLE>I opened it for the exciting cases, you know?

93
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:04,150
<4-8,CASTLE>两面三刀的女人  被盗古迹

<4-9,ALEXIS>老爸  那都是40年代神秘小说的情节
<4-9,ALEXIS>Dad, you're just naming plots from 1940s gumshoe novels.

96
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,340
<4-9,ALEXIS>说起来  你不是该在写下一本
<4-9,ALEXIS>Speaking of, aren't you supposed to be writing

99
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,560
<4-10,CASTLE>把这企业什么的破案子丢在一边
<4-10,CASTLE>Let's just ditch this corporate nonsense

100
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,730
<4-10,CASTLE>找一个值得调查的案子吧
<4-10,CASTLE>and find a case worthy of investigating,

105
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:26,780
<4-10,CASTLE>这...
<4-10,CASTLE>Now, that --

106
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,380
<4-10,CASTLE>这案子才值得一查

<5-2,PERLMUTTER>I've been meaning to say how proud I am of you.

110
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:38,570
<5-3,BECKETT>为什么
<5-3,BECKETT>For what?

111
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,020
<5-4,PERLMUTTER>当然是因为你跟卡塞尔先生分手了
<5-4,PERLMUTTER>For breaking up with Mr. Castle, of course.

112
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:44,690

<5-12,PERLMUTTER>Cause of death was blunt-force trauma to the skull.

124
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,390
<5-14,PERLMUTTER>从尸斑来看
<5-14,PERLMUTTER>Based on lividity,

125
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:15,100
<5-14,PERLMUTTER>死亡时间应该是昨晚9点到11点
<5-14,PERLMUTTER>I'd say it took place between 9:00 and 11:00 last night.

126
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,610
<5-15,BECKETT>那么凶手把他的尸体丢进蛇坑
<5-15,BECKETT>So, then, the killer must have dumped his body in the snake pit

127
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,270
<5-15,BECKETT>一定是为拖延我们的调查
<5-15,BECKETT>to slow down our investigation.

128
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,580
<5-16,CASTLE>真是聪明
<5-16,CASTLE>Genius plan.

129
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:23,030
<5-17,PERLMUTTER>卡塞尔先生  你来做什么
<5-17,PERLMUTTER>Mr. Castle, what the hell are you doing here?!

130
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,390
<5-18,CASTLE>见到你我也很高兴  帕穆特
<5-18,CASTLE>It is nice to see you, too, Perlmutter.

131
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,170
<5-19,PERLMUTTER>你看不出她已经不爱你了吗
<5-19,PERLMUTTER>Can't you see the lady doesn't love you anymore?

132
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:28,830
<5-19,PERLMUTTER>像个男人样  放手吧
<5-19,PERLMUTTER>Be a man. Walk away.

133
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:31,830
<5-19,PERLMUTTER>瞧  就因为你这样没脑子的小白脸
<5-19,PERLMUTTER>See, it's because of nitwit pretty boys like you

134
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:34,860
<5-19,PERLMUTTER>我弟弟埃德加那样的好男人才找不到...
<5-19,PERLMUTTER>that good men like my brother, Edgar, struggle to find --

135
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:35,730
<5-20,BECKETT>帕穆特
<5-20,BECKETT>Uh, Perlmutter,

136
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:38,260
<5-20,BECKETT>能不能让我们单独待会儿
<5-20,BECKETT>would you mind giving us the room just for a moment?

137
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:42,090
<5-21,PERLMUTTER>如果你需要  这儿有解剖刀和肋骨撑开器
<5-21,PERLMUTTER>There's a scalpel and a rib spreader if you need them.

138
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:47,280
<5-22,CASTLE>帕穆特真是不喜欢我啊
<5-22,CASTLE>Perlmutter really doesn't like me.

139
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,430
<5-23,BECKETT>我现在也不喜欢你
<5-23,BECKETT>Neither do I right now.

140
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:50,320
<5-24,CASTLE>我知道  我就是想看看那些蛇
<5-24,CASTLE>I know, I know, I just wanted to see the snakes.

141
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:52,560
<5-25,BECKETT>自便  卡塞尔  都在动物园里呢
<5-25,BECKETT>Help yourself, Castle. They are all at the zoo.

142
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,440
<5-26,CASTLE>是吗  没带过来吗
<5-26,CASTLE>Really? They're not here?

143
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,100
<5-26,CASTLE>我以为会被算作证物呢
<5-26,CASTLE>I thought they would be evidence or something.

144
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:56,440
<5-27,BECKETT>不  但这个可能是
<5-27,BECKETT>No, but this might be.

145
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,730
<5-27,BECKETT>有人昨天给被害人发过短信
<5-27,BECKETT>Someone sent the victim a text yesterday.

146
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,120
<5-27,BECKETT>"我的钱呢  埃迪
<5-27,BECKETT>"Where go my money, Eddie?

147
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:02,920
<5-28,CASTLE>你欠了大钱  该还了
<5-28,CASTLE>Yous owe huge. Paybacks time.

148
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,740
<5-28,CASTLE>我有办法让你死"
<5-28,CASTLE>I got ways for to get you dead."

149
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:08,110
<5-27,BECKETT>发信号码屏蔽了
<5-27,BECKETT>It was sent by a blocked number.

150
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:09,710
<5-27,BECKETT>看看维克拉姆能不能追踪到
<5-27,BECKETT>I'll see if Vikram can trace it.

151
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:11,780
<5-28,CASTLE>"我有办法让你死"
<5-28,CASTLE>"I got ways for to get you dead."

152
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:14,040
<5-28,CASTLE>好特别的语法  好独特的结构
<5-28,CASTLE>That's particular syntax, unique grammatical structure,

153
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,920
<5-28,CASTLE>或许有什么文化重要性
<5-28,CASTLE>perhaps denoting a cultural significance.

154
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,180
<5-29,BECKETT>或许是自动更正的问题
<5-29,BECKETT>Or maybe bad autocorrect.

155
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,330
<5-30,CASTLE>不  贝克特  这不是失误
<5-30,CASTLE>No, Beckett. This was no error.

156
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:20,000
<5-30,CASTLE>这是选择
<5-30,CASTLE>This was a specific choice.

157
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,870
<5-30,CASTLE>是有条理的决定  是最基本的方言
<5-30,CASTLE>It was a methodical decision, Dialectology 101,

158
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:25,570
<5-30,CASTLE>而我恰巧又是英语专家
<5-30,CASTLE>and I, being an expert in the English language,

159
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:28,230
<5-30,CASTLE>很乐意帮你破解这语言的谜团
<5-30,CASTLE>would be happy to help you solve this linguistic mystery.

160
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:30,250
<5-31,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你不能参与查案
<5-31,BECKETT>Castle, you're not gonna work the case.

161
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,830
<5-31,BECKETT>所以  你还是回家去
<5-31,BECKETT>So, why don't you just, uh, go back home,

162
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,360
<5-31,BECKETT>我们今晚见
<5-31,BECKETT>and I will see you tonight.

163
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:38,310
<5-32,CASTLE>虽然我喜欢吻你  贝克特
<5-32,CASTLE>While I do love kissing you, Beckett,

164
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,550
<5-32,CASTLE>但在死尸面前
<5-32,CASTLE>it's just a little creepy

165
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:41,100
<5-32,CASTLE>感觉有点恐怖
<5-32,CASTLE>when you do it in front of a dead body.

166
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:43,750
<5-32,CASTLE>不太得体
<5-32,CASTLE>It's...inappropriate.

167
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:46,100
<6-1,ESPOSITO>警监  看我们在埃迪·拉米雷斯
<6-1,ESPOSITO>Captain, check out what we found

168
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,480
<6-1,ESPOSITO>床下发现了什么
<6-1,ESPOSITO>hidden under Eddie Ramirez's bed.

169
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:50,390
<6-2,RYAN>一万美元  问题是
<6-2,RYAN>Ten G's. The question is

170
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:53,180
<6-2,RYAN>一个靠饲养蛇和蜥蜴为生的人
<6-2,RYAN>how does someone who feeds snakes and lizards for a living

171
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,030
<6-2,RYAN>怎么能筹到这么多现金
<6-2,RYAN>scrape together this much cash?

172
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:56,750
<6-3,BECKETT>埃迪收到的那则威胁短信
<6-3,BECKETT>Now, that threatening text that Eddie received

173
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,970
<6-3,BECKETT>就是关于欠钱的
<6-3,BECKETT>was about owing someone money.

174
00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:59,860
<6-3,BECKETT>如果这两者没有联系才怪呢
<6-3,BECKETT>I'd be shocked if those two aren't related.

175
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:02,080
<6-4,VIKRAM SINGH>如果有  那我或许能帮忙
<6-4,VIKRAM SINGH>If they are, then I might be of assistance.

176
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,260
<6-4,VIKRAM SINGH>那则短信是由一部不可追踪一次性手机发的
<6-4,VIKRAM SINGH>Turns out the text was sent from an untraceable burner,

177
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,630
<6-4,VIKRAM SINGH>但短信发出时
<6-4,VIKRAM SINGH>but when the text was sent,

178
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,360
<6-4,VIKRAM SINGH>经过了一个无线网络
<6-4,VIKRAM SINGH>it had to go through a wireless network.

179
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,600
<6-5,RYAN>-你查到网络了吗  -是的
<6-5,RYAN>- Did you track down the network? - Yep.

180
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,120
<6-6,VIKRAM>是一家英语二外学校的
<6-6,VIKRAM>It belongs to an English-as-a-second-language school.

181
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:12,750
<6-7,ESPOSITO>跟埃迪·拉米雷斯有什么联系吗
<6-7,ESPOSITO>Is there any connection to Eddie Ramirez?

182
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,770
<6-8,VIKRAM>我跟老师谈过话  对方说
<6-8,VIKRAM>I spoke with a teacher who said

183
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:14,850
<6-8,VIKRAM>埃迪曾是班上学员
<6-8,VIKRAM>Eddie was a part of the class,

184
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:17,210
<6-8,VIKRAM>但昨天短信发出的时间他不在
<6-8,VIKRAM>but he was absent yesterday when the text was sent.

185
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:19,190
<6-9,BECKETT>-好吧  去看看  -好
<6-9,BECKETT>- All right, guys. Go check it out. - All right.

186
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:23,670
<7-1,The students in the class repeat en mass after the teacher>要从这里前往肯尼迪机场
<7-1,The students in the class repeat en mass after the teacher>To get to JFK airport from here,

187
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:26,350
<7-1,The students in the class repeat en mass after the teacher>你可以搭乘E列车
<7-1,The students in the class repeat en mass after the teacher>you can take the E train.

188
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:28,390
<7-2,JOHN EMERSON>但由于你要赶不上航班了
<7-2,JOHN EMERSON>But since you are late for your flight,

189
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:30,660
<7-2,JOHN EMERSON>我建议你打的
<7-2,JOHN EMERSON>I suggest you take a cab.

190
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,200
<7-2,JOHN EMERSON>但由于你要赶不上航班了
<7-2,JOHN EMERSON>But since you are late for your flight,

191
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,060
<7-2,JOHN EMERSON>我建议你打的
<7-2,JOHN EMERSON>I suggest you take a cab.

192
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,840
<7-3,ESPOSITO>我们是纽约警局的
<7-3,ESPOSITO>Yo, we're NYPD.

193
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,480
<7-4,RYAN>我们得谈谈
<7-4,RYAN>We need to talk.

194
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,640
<7-3,ESPOSITO>我们是纽约警局的
<7-3,ESPOSITO>Yo, we're NYPD.

195
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:44,700
<7-4,RYAN>我们得谈谈
<7-4,RYAN>We need to talk.

196
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:48,620
<7-4,RYAN>埃迪的事真是令人震惊
<7-4,RYAN>This thing about Eddie is quite a shock.

197
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,740
<8-1,EMERSON>同学们议论一早晨了
<8-1,EMERSON>The students have been talking about it all morning.

198
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,490
<8-2,RYAN>我们了解到埃迪昨天没来上课
<8-2,RYAN>We understand that Eddie missed class yesterday.

199
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:54,370
<8-2,RYAN>你知道他是不是在回避另一名学生吗
<8-2,RYAN>Do you know if he was avoiding any of the other students,

200
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:55,640
<8-2,RYAN>或许是最近跟他有矛盾的人
<8-2,RYAN>perhaps someone he was having problems with?

201
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,560
<8-3,EMERSON>埃迪  不  他人很好  很温柔
<8-3,EMERSON>Eddie? No. He was a sweet man, a gentle soul.

202
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,540
<8-3,EMERSON>大家都喜欢他
<8-3,EMERSON>Everybody liked him.

203
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,710
<8-4,ESPOSITO>不会是每个人
<8-4,ESPOSITO>Well, not everybody.

204
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:03,890
<8-4,ESPOSITO>这则短信是昨天上课期间发出去的
<8-4,ESPOSITO>This text was sent yesterday during class.

205
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:05,450
<8-4,ESPOSITO>知道这可能是谁写的吗
<8-4,ESPOSITO>Any idea who might have written that?

206
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:06,780
<8-5,EMERSON>"我的钱呢  埃迪
<8-5,EMERSON>"Where go my money, Eddie?

207
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:09,190
<8-5,EMERSON>你欠了大钱  该还了"
<8-5,EMERSON>Yous owe huge. Paybacks time."

208
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,250
<8-5,EMERSON>不知道  不好说
<8-5,EMERSON>I don't know. It's -- It's hard to say.

209
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,190
<8-5,EMERSON>我的学生英语都不太熟练
<8-5,EMERSON>All my students are still learning English.

210
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,810
<8-6,RYAN>那我们得找你所有的学生问话
<8-6,RYAN>Well, then we're gonna need to talk to all your students,

211
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:15,560
<8-6,RYAN>一个个来
<8-6,RYAN>one by one.

212
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,540
<8-7,EMERSON>那会比你想的要困难  警探
<8-7,EMERSON>That's gonna be harder than you think, Detective.

213
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:20,100
<8-7,EMERSON>大部分学生来自警察腐败的国家
<8-7,EMERSON>Most of my students come from countries where the cops are corrupt,

214
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,350
<8-7,EMERSON>他们不会想跟你们说话的
<8-7,EMERSON>so they're not gonna want to talk to you.

215
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,710
<8-8,RYAN>老师
<8-8,RYAN>Look, teach.

216
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:25,350
<8-8,RYAN>我们不教你怎么动词变位
<8-8,RYAN>We don't tell you how to conjugate a verb.

217
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:26,990
<8-8,RYAN>你也别教我们怎么审讯嫌犯
<8-8,RYAN>Don't tell us how to interview a suspect.

218
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:29,140
<8-9,ESPOSITO>是啊  我们会让他们开口的
<8-9,ESPOSITO>Yeah. We're gonna get them to talk.

219
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:31,940
<9-1,BECKETT>他们没有一个人肯开口吗
<9-1,BECKETT>And you couldn't get any of them to talk?

220
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,610
<9-2,RYAN>哈维拿到了埃迪
<9-2,RYAN>Javi did get a contact number

221
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:35,440
<9-2,RYAN>萨尔瓦多亲戚的联系电话
<9-2,RYAN>for Eddie's next of kin in El Salvador.

222
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,760
<9-3,ESPOSITO>是的  但家里没人
<9-3,ESPOSITO>That's true, but there was no one home,

223
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,000
<9-3,ESPOSITO>我们就留了言
<9-3,ESPOSITO>so I had to leave a message.

224
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,540
<9-5,RYAN>警监  我们可以把学生都
<9-5,RYAN>Captain, we can drag each of the students

225
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,520
<9-5,RYAN>拉来审讯室  让他们紧张  交待实话
<9-5,RYAN>down into interrogation, sweat the truth out of them.

226
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,230
<9-6,BECKETT>不行  如果他们已经很怕警察了
<9-6,BECKETT>Uh, no. If they're already afraid of cops,

227
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:45,230
<9-6,BECKETT>那只会让他们更加不愿配合
<9-6,BECKETT>it's only gonna alienate them further.

228
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,320
<9-6,BECKETT>但或许还有其他的办法
<9-6,BECKETT>But there might be another way to do this.

229
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:49,580
<9-7,ESPOSITO>你有什么想法
<9-7,ESPOSITO>What do you have in mind?

230
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:50,780
<9-8,BECKETT>别管了
<9-8,BECKETT>Uh, don't worry about it.

231
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,620
<9-8,BECKETT>你们去查查学生的生活
<9-8,BECKETT>Why don't you guys dig into those students' lives?

232
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,270
<9-8,BECKETT>显然  他们中有人隐瞒了自己对埃迪的真实看法
<9-8,BECKETT>Clearly, one of them is hiding their true feelings about Eddie.

233
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:56,240
<9-9,RYAN>好的
<9-9,RYAN>All right.

234
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:12,450
<10-2,BECKETT>你干什么呢
<10-2,BECKETT>What are you doing?

235
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:13,860
<10-3,CASTLE>没干什么  看书呢

<15-15,HAYLEY>但他说他不是真心的
<15-15,HAYLEY>but he swears he didn't mean it.

359
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,470
<15-15,HAYLEY>他只是很生气而已
<15-15,HAYLEY>He was just really pissed off.

360
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:28,350
<15-16,RYAN>就算阿利斯泰尔说的是真的
<15-16,RYAN>Um, let's assume that Alistair is telling the truth.

361
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:30,750
<15-16,RYAN>你知道他把你的车开去哪了吗
<15-16,RYAN>Do you know where he took your cab?

362
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,550
<15-16,RYAN>你知道他是去见什么人了吗
<15-16,RYAN>Do you know if he was meeting someone?

363
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,740
<15-18,HAYLEY>跟我们说说那辆野鸡车
<15-18,HAYLEY>So, tell us about your gypsy cab.

364
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,090
<15-19,ESPOSITO>有定位系统吗
<15-19,ESPOSITO>Does it have GPS?

365
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,570
<15-20,ALISTAIR>有
<15-20,ALISTAIR>Aye.

366
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,090
<16-1,RYAN>阿利斯泰尔的不在场证明证实了
<16-1,RYAN>Well, Alistair alibied out.

367
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,760
<16-1,RYAN>死亡时间内
<16-1,RYAN>He was blind drunk at a pub

368
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,100
<16-1,RYAN>他在一家酒吧喝得烂醉
<16-1,RYAN>during our time of death window.

369
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,490
<16-2,BECKETT>那他的野鸡车呢
<16-2,BECKETT>And what about his gypsy cab?

370
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:48,470
<16-3,RYAN>看来阿利斯泰尔说的是真话
<16-3,RYAN>Looks like Alistair was telling the truth.

371
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:51,430
<16-3,RYAN>不管埃迪把车开去了哪  有人企图杀他
<16-3,RYAN>Wherever Eddie drove that cab, someone tried to kill him.

372
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,010
<16-4,BECKETT>看来这位温和的动物园管理员
<16-4,BECKETT>Sounds like our mild-mannered zoo worker

373
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:55,300
<16-4,BECKETT>惹了什么人啊
<16-4,BECKETT>rattled a few cages.

374
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,720
<16-5,ESPOSITO>其实  埃迪也没那么温和
<16-5,ESPOSITO>Actually, Eddie wasn't so mild-mannered after all.

375
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,260
<16-5,ESPOSITO>我联系上了他在萨尔瓦多的亲戚
<16-5,ESPOSITO>I got in touch with his next of kin in El Salvador.

376
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,510
<16-5,ESPOSITO>埃迪以前是个警察
<16-5,ESPOSITO>Eddie used to be a cop.

377
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:03,350
<16-6,BECKETT>等等  他是个警察
<16-6,BECKETT>Wait. He was a cop?

378
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,870
<16-6,BECKETT>我们怎么会才知道
<16-6,BECKETT>Why are we just hearing about this now?

379
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,430
<16-7,ESPOSITO>他在移民表格上隐瞒了
<16-7,ESPOSITO>He lied on his immigration forms.

380
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:07,580
<16-8,RYAN>埃迪为什么不希望大家知道
<16-8,RYAN>Why wouldn't Eddie want people to know

381
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:08,780
<16-8,RYAN>他曾是警察
<16-8,RYAN>he's a former police officer?

382
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:09,720
<16-9,ESPOSITO>我也觉得这很奇怪
<16-9,ESPOSITO>I thought that was strange, too,

383
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,940
<16-9,ESPOSITO>所以就调查了一番
<16-9,ESPOSITO>so I did a little digging.

384
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,010
<16-9,ESPOSITO>显然有传言说
<16-9,ESPOSITO>Apparently, there were rumors

385
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:14,640
<16-9,ESPOSITO>埃迪是一个黑警小队的一员
<16-9,ESPOSITO>that Eddie was part of a corrupt police unit.

386
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,290
<16-9,ESPOSITO>这些人被指
<16-9,ESPOSITO>And these guys were accused of

387
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:18,520
<16-9,ESPOSITO>敲诈罪犯  收受贿赂
<16-9,ESPOSITO>extorting criminals, taking bribes.

388
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,250
<16-10,VIKRAM>我查了阿利斯泰尔野鸡车的定位系统
<16-10,VIKRAM>So, I've gone through the GPS on Alistair's gypsy cab.

389
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,890
<16-10,VIKRAM>看来埃迪只去了一个地方
<16-10,VIKRAM>Looks like Eddie only made one stop,

390
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,470
<16-10,VIKRAM>一个叫索尔达娜俱乐部的地方
<16-10,VIKRAM>a place called the Saldana Club.

391
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:27,010
<16-11,BECKETT>好吧  我们对那里有什么了解
<16-11,BECKETT>Okay. What do we know about this place?

392
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:29,350
<17-1,ESPOSITO>经营者是何塞和弗兰基·索尔达娜
<17-1,ESPOSITO>It's run by Jose and Frankie Saldana,

393
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,720
<16-12,VIKRAM>两人没什么分量
<16-12,VIKRAM>a couple of low-level players,

394
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,480
<16-12,VIKRAM>但他们有袭击和非法交易的前科
<16-12,VIKRAM>but they got priors for assault and trafficking.

395
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:35,350
<16-12,VIKRAM>另外  据说他们在俱乐部里贩毒
<16-12,VIKRAM>Plus, word is they deal drugs out of their club.

396
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:36,160
<16-13,RYAN>如果埃迪以前在
<16-13,RYAN>Well, if Eddie used to

397
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,470
<16-13,RYAN>萨尔瓦多敲诈罪犯
<16-13,RYAN>shake down crooks back in El Salvador,

398
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,340
<16-13,RYAN>或许他又对他们做了一样的事
<16-13,RYAN>maybe he was doing the same thing to these guys here.

399
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,870
<16-14,BECKETT>而他们可能为此杀了他
<16-14,BECKETT>And they might have killed him for it.

400
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:41,950
<16-14,BECKETT>我们走
<16-14,BECKETT>Let's go.

401
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:51,810
<17-1,ESPOSITO>何塞和弗兰基·索尔达娜吗
<17-1,ESPOSITO>Jose and Frankie Saldana?

402
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:53,460
<17-2,JOSE SALDANA>是的  你们是谁
<17-2,JOSE SALDANA>Yeah. Who's asking?

403
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:58,030
<17-3,ESPOSITO>怎么回事  有人丢了颗手榴弹吗
<17-3,ESPOSITO>So, what happened? Someone drop a grenade in here?

404
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,980
<17-4,JOSE>我们在重装修  喜欢吗
<17-4,JOSE>We're redecorating. You like?

405
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,190
<17-5,RYAN>看来你们惹了麻烦
<17-5,RYAN>Looks like you boys got into a little trouble.

406
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:03,460
<17-6,JOSE>嗯  攀岩事故
<17-6,JOSE>Yeah. Rock-climbing accident.

407
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:05,640
<17-7,RYAN>弗兰基忘记怎么系那种
<17-7,RYAN>See, Frankie here forgot how to tie

408
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,280
<17-8,JOSE>很复杂的绳结了
<17-8,JOSE>one of those fancy knots.

409
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:09,790
<17-8,JOSE>哎呦
<17-8,JOSE>Whoopsie.

410
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:12,130
<17-9,RYAN>那么跟埃迪·拉米雷斯毫无关系
<17-9,RYAN>So, it's got nothing to do with Eddie Ramirez,

411
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:13,560
<17-9,RYAN>就是你们冲他开枪的那人
<17-9,RYAN>the guy you took a shot at --

412
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,850
<17-10,BECKETT>抱歉  我得找杯水喝
<17-10,BECKETT>Sorry. I have to get water.

413
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:16,610
<17-11,JOSE>埃迪·拉米雷斯
<17-11,JOSE>Eddie Ramirez.

414
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,050
<17-11,JOSE>-没听说过  -是吗
<17-11,JOSE>- Never heard of him. - Really?

415
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,500
<17-12,ESPOSITO>因为如果一个矮个50岁老头打了我的脸
<17-12,ESPOSITO>Because if a short 50-year-old man broke my face

416
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,280
<17-12,ESPOSITO>还偷了我一万块  我肯定会记得他
<17-12,ESPOSITO>and stole 10 grand, I'd remember.

417
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:27,080
<17-13,BECKETT>在想什么事吗
<17-13,BECKETT>Uh, something on your mind?

418
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,190
<17-14,BARTENDER>他们在撒谎
<17-14,BARTENDER>They're lying their asses off.

419
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:30,860
<17-14,BARTENDER>那人  埃迪·拉米雷斯
<17-14,BARTENDER>That man, Eddie Ramirez?

420
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:32,610
<17-15,BECKETT>-他来过  -怎么回事
<17-15,BECKETT>- He was here. - What happened?

421
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,740
<17-16,BARTENDER>来的时候挺从容  紧接着
<17-16,BARTENDER>Came in all calm. Next thing I know,

422
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,910
<17-16,BARTENDER>他就把何塞和弗兰基打得满地找牙了
<17-16,BARTENDER>he's beating the crap out of Jose and Frankie.

423
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,370
<17-16,BARTENDER>逼他们往一个箱子里装钱
<17-16,BARTENDER>Forced them to fill up a briefcase with cash.

424
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:40,620
<17-17,BECKETT>你都看到了吗
<17-17,BECKETT>And you saw that all happen?

425
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,310
<17-18,BARTENDER>是的  埃迪准备离开时
<17-18,BARTENDER>Oh, yeah. As Eddie was walking out,

426
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:44,350
<17-18,BARTENDER>弗兰基从吧台下面掏出把枪来
<17-18,BARTENDER>Frankie grabbed a gun from under the bar,

427
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:46,340
<17-18,BARTENDER>蹒跚地走出去  冲他的车开了枪
<17-18,BARTENDER>hobbled out, and shot up the guy's car.

428
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,980
<17-19,BECKETT>那昨晚呢
<17-19,BECKETT>Okay, then what about last night?

429
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,230
<17-19,BECKETT>他们有去对付埃迪  寻求报复吗
<17-19,BECKETT>Did they go after Eddie, try to get their revenge?

430
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:50,770
<17-19,BECKETT>不可能
<17-19,BECKETT>They couldn't have.

431
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:52,370
<17-20,BARTENDER>他们那时都躺在医院呢
<17-20,BARTENDER>They were both laid up in the hospital.

432
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:53,790
<17-20,BARTENDER>今早刚出院的
<17-20,BARTENDER>Just got released this morning.

433
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,160
<17-21,BECKETT>埃迪为什么要来这儿勒索他们的钱
<17-21,BECKETT>Why would Eddie come here to shake them down for money?

434
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,060
<17-22,BARTENDER>我觉得并不是勒索那么简单
<17-22,BARTENDER>I don't think this was a straight-up shakedown.

435
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,950
<17-22,BARTENDER>我听到埃迪说他这是为了
<17-22,BARTENDER>I overheard Eddie saying that he was doing this

436
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:02,630
<17-22,BARTENDER>一个以前在这儿工作的女孩
<17-22,BARTENDER>for some girl who used to work here.

437
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,840
<17-22,BARTENDER>一个女侍者
<17-22,BARTENDER>A waitress.

438
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:04,530
<17-23,BECKETT>什么女孩
<17-23,BECKETT>What girl?

439
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,790
<18-1,CASTLE>艾达
<18-1,CASTLE>Aida.

440
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:08,840
<18-1,CASTLE>你觉得是她杀了埃迪
<18-1,CASTLE>You think she killed Eddie?

441
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,930
<18-2,BECKETT>我们只知道索尔达娜兄弟俩有不在场证明
<18-2,BECKETT>Well, all we know is that the Saldana brothers alibied out.

442
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:14,420
<18-2,BECKETT>而她显然跟此事有关
<18-2,BECKETT>And clearly she's wrapped up in all of this.

443
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,020
<18-3,AIDA>为什么找我来  我没干坏事
<18-3,AIDA>Why am I here? I've done no wrong.

444
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:19,180
<18-4,RYAN>我们只是有几个关于埃迪·拉米雷斯的问题要问你
<18-4,RYAN>We just have a few questions about Eddie Ramirez.

445
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:24,520
<19-1,ESPOSITO>听着  艾达  我们知道索尔达娜俱乐部劫案的事了
<19-1,ESPOSITO>Look, Aida, we know about the robbery at the Saldana Club.

446
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,760
<19-2,AIDA>三天前  埃迪在课后看到我在哭
<19-2,AIDA>Eddie saw me crying after class three days ago.

447
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:31,890
<19-2,AIDA>我...
<19-2,AIDA>I was, um --

448
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:38,440
<19-2,AIDA>因为被索尔达娜俱乐部解雇而非常难过
<19-2,AIDA>very upset because I was fired from Saldana Club.

449
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,700
<19-3,ESPOSITO>你为什么被解雇了
<19-3,ESPOSITO>So, why were you fired?

450
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,360
<19-4,AIDA>我在那儿干了两年
<19-4,AIDA>I work two years there,

451
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,290
<19-4,AIDA>但就因为我没有绿卡
<19-4,AIDA>but because I-I don't have green card,

452
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:48,450
<19-4,AIDA>何塞和弗兰基逼我拿出30%的工资给他们
<19-4,AIDA>Jose and Frankie make me give them 30% of my paycheck.

453
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:50,090
<19-5,RYAN>-他们在敲诈你  -是的
<19-5,RYAN>- They were extorting you? - Yes.

454
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,250
<19-6,AIDA>但因为学习英语二外
<19-6,AIDA>But from taking ESL class,

455
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:55,320
<19-6,AIDA>我有了自尊  要求他们给我钱
<19-6,AIDA>I get self-esteem and I demand my money.

456
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,880
<19-6,AIDA>于是他们就解雇了我
<19-6,AIDA>That when they fire me.

457
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,960
<19-6,AIDA>埃迪听说后  非常气愤
<19-6,AIDA>When Eddie heard, he was very furious.

458
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,270
<19-6,AIDA>他说他要去找他们
<19-6,AIDA>He say he would stand up to them

459
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:03,810
<19-6,AIDA>帮我拿回钱
<19-6,AIDA>and get all my money back.

460
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:04,880
<19-7,RYAN>好吧  如果是这样
<19-7,RYAN>Okay, if that's the case,

461
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,510
<19-7,RYAN>那埃迪怎么没把钱给你
<19-7,RYAN>then why didn't Eddie give you the money?

462
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:08,050
<19-8,AIDA>埃迪打算给的
<19-8,AIDA>But Eddie was going to.

463
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:10,100
<19-8,AIDA>他昨天早上打给我
<19-8,AIDA>He called me yesterday morning

464
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,440
<19-8,AIDA>说他为我拿到了一万美金
<19-8,AIDA>to say he got $10,000 for me.

465
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,400
<19-8,AIDA>我只需要等等
<19-8,AIDA>I just had to wait

466
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,690
<19-8,AIDA>因为他那天不能去上课
<19-8,AIDA>because he was not coming to class that day.

467
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:17,710
<19-9,ESPOSITO>埃迪昨天为什么没去上课
<19-9,ESPOSITO>So why wasn't Eddie coming to class yesterday?

00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,990
<24-2,BECKETT>是的  我
<24-2,BECKETT>Yeah, I --

582
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:58,180
<24-3,CASTLE>今晚的英语二外课上发生了怪事
<24-3,CASTLE>Something weird happened at ESL class tonight.

583
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,290
<24-4,BECKETT>-怎么啦  -嘿
<24-4,BECKETT>- What happened? - Hey!

584
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,870
<24-5,ESPOSITO>我们刚刚从安妮塔·罗德里格斯的公寓回来
<24-5,ESPOSITO>So, we just got back from Anita Rodriguez's apartment.

585
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:03,110
<24-5,ESPOSITO>找到的指纹与前科犯匹配
<24-5,ESPOSITO>We got a hit on a print.

586
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:05,060
<24-6,BECKETT>马科·萨特
<24-6,BECKETT>Marco Sutter?

587
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:07,670
<24-7,RYAN>是  他是科罗纳区的打手
<24-7,RYAN>Yeah, he's an enforcer from up in the Corona neighborhood.

588
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:09,200
<24-7,RYAN>有组织犯罪科有他的档案
<24-7,RYAN>Organized crime has a file on this guy.

589
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,500
<24-7,RYAN>敲诈  洗钱  蓄意攻击
<24-7,RYAN>Extortion, money laundering, assault with intent.

590
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:12,800
<24-8,BECKETT>好  去把他带来
<24-8,BECKETT>All right. Go pick him up.

591
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:26,630
<24-8,BECKETT>马科·萨特
<24-8,BECKETT>Marco Sutter?

592
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:28,250
<25-1,RYAN>纽约警察
<25-1,RYAN>Nypd.

593
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:30,310
<25-2,RYAN>待那儿别动
<25-2,RYAN>Hold it right there.

594
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:35,990
<25-3,RYAN>枪
<25-3,RYAN>Gun!

595
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:45,250
<25-5,ESPOSITO>上吧
<25-5,ESPOSITO>Let's go!

596
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:46,430
<25-5,ESPOSITO>上
<25-5,ESPOSITO>Go!

597
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,440
<25-6,RYAN>-纽约警察  -让我看到你的双手
<25-6,RYAN>- NYPD! - Let me see your hands!

598
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,130
<25-6,RYAN>马上让我看到你的双手
<25-6,RYAN>Let me see your hands right now!

599
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:54,210
<25-7,ESPOSITO>把手从窗户里伸出来  马上
<25-7,ESPOSITO>Put them out the window, now!

600
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,430
<26-1,BECKETT>我这么认为
<26-1,BECKETT>Here's what I think.

601
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,320
<26-1,BECKETT>你要勒索一个弱势的外来移民
<26-1,BECKETT>You tried to extort a powerless immigrant,

602
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:02,160
<26-1,BECKETT>她付不起钱  你杀了她
<26-1,BECKETT>and when she couldn't pay, you killed her.

603
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:04,400
<26-1,BECKETT>当埃迪·拉米雷斯来找她
<26-1,BECKETT>And when Eddie Ramirez came looking for her,

604
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,600
<26-1,BECKETT>你把他也杀了
<26-1,BECKETT>you killed him, too.

605
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,380
<26-2,MARCO>我要律师
<26-2,MARCO>I want a lawyer.

606
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:13,410
<27-1,RYAN>-嘿  -马科找了律师
<27-1,RYAN>- Hey. -Marco lawyered up.

607
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,860
<27-2,BECKETT>但看看这个
<27-2,BECKETT>But check this out.

608
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,680
<27-3,RYAN>我们在他钱包里发现了有趣的东西
<27-3,RYAN>We found something interesting tucked inside his wallet.

609
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:18,760
<27-4,ESPOSITO>我们追踪到了
<27-4,ESPOSITO>We traced it to a locker out

610
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,610
<27-4,ESPOSITO>乔治·华盛顿大桥车站的储物箱
<27-4,ESPOSITO>at the G.W. Bridge bus station.

611
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:22,730
<27-5,BECKETT>我猜马科应该不会是把送洗的衣服放那里
<27-5,BECKETT>I doubt Marco is keeping his laundry there.

612
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:24,420
<27-5,BECKETT>兴许能成为证据来要他开口
<27-5,BECKETT>Could be evidence we can use as leverage.

613
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:25,500
<27-6,ESPOSITO>我们去查查
<27-6,ESPOSITO>We'll look into it.

614
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:29,420
<28-1,RYAN>这一天过得
<28-1,RYAN>Oh, what a day.

615
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,610
<28-2,ESPOSITO>可不是
<28-2,ESPOSITO>Tell me about it.

616
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:33,130
<28-2,ESPOSITO>条条大蛇  又遭枪击
<28-2,ESPOSITO>Pit of snakes, getting shot at it.

617
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:35,290
<28-3,RYAN>感谢老天  快结束了
<28-3,RYAN>Thank God it's almost over.

618
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:38,300
<28-3,RYAN>我再受不了更多刺激了
<28-3,RYAN>I don't think that I could take any more excitement.

619
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:40,520
<28-3,RYAN>联邦调查局  趴下  趴下  趴下
<28-3,RYAN>FBI! Get down, get down, get down!

620
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:54,640
<29-1,AGENT NAPIER>你知道联调局跟着案子多久了吗
<29-1,AGENT NAPIER>Do you know how long the FBI's been on this case?

621
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:56,660
<29-1,AGENT NAPIER>两年
<29-1,AGENT NAPIER>Two years!

622
00:24:57,330 --> 00:25:00,310
<29-1,AGENT NAPIER>直到克罗克特和塔布斯搞砸我的监视行动
<29-1,AGENT NAPIER>Before Crockett and Tubbs here T-boned my stakeout.

624
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:02,540
<29-2,BECKETT>莱恩和埃斯波西托警探
<29-2,BECKETT>Detectives Ryan and Esposito

625
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:05,010
<29-2,BECKETT>在调查谋杀案  内皮尔探员
<29-2,BECKETT>are investigating a homicide, Agent Napier.

626
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:06,860
<29-2,BECKETT>就此监视行动  联调局
<29-2,BECKETT>And no FBI alert came across my desk

627
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:08,210
<29-2,BECKETT>并未事先提醒过我
<29-2,BECKETT>about your precious little stakeout,

628
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:10,290
<29-2,BECKETT>你干嘛不放低点姿态
<29-2,BECKETT>so why don't you drop the attitude?

629
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:11,420
<29-3,AGENT NAPIER>你怎么找到储物柜的
<29-3,AGENT NAPIER>How'd you find that locker?

630
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:14,460
<29-4,BECKETT>我们的谋杀嫌疑人被捕时带着钥匙
<29-4,BECKETT>Our murder suspect had a key on him when we arrested him.

631
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:16,900
<29-5,AGENT NAPIER>这个嫌疑人叫什么名字
<29-5,AGENT NAPIER>And this suspect, does he have a name?

632
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,770
<29-6,BECKETT>不  除非你先告诉我发生了什么
<29-6,BECKETT>No. Not until you tell me what's going on.

633
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,410
<29-7,AGENT NAPIER>我不能随便讨论
<29-7,AGENT NAPIER>Oh, I'm not at liberty to discuss

634
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:23,130
<29-7,AGENT NAPIER>有关此案的具体细节
<29-7,AGENT NAPIER>the specifics of my case.

635
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:24,110
<29-7,AGENT NAPIER>好吧
<29-7,AGENT NAPIER>Okay.

636
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:25,590
<29-8,BECKETT>那我想我们没什么好谈的了
<29-8,BECKETT>Then I guess we're done here.

637
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:27,170
<29-8,BECKETT>是马科·萨特  对吗
<29-8,BECKETT>It's Marco Sutter, isn't it?

638
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:29,870
<29-9,AGENT NAPIER>这是唯一一个可能有钥匙的人
<29-9,AGENT NAPIER>It's the only logical person to have a key.

639
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:30,910
<29-9,AGENT NAPIER>你们得放他走
<29-9,AGENT NAPIER>You need to let him go.

640
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:31,960
<29-10,ESPOSITO>不可能
<29-10,ESPOSITO>Screw that.

641
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:33,430
<29-10,ESPOSITO>他向我们开枪了
<29-10,ESPOSITO>He shot at us.

642
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,600
<29-11,AGENT NAPIER>我不在乎
<29-11,AGENT NAPIER>I don't care.

643
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,040
<29-12,RYAN>你该在乎  因为如果这样我们都放他走
<29-12,RYAN>Well, you should, because if we let him go after that,

644
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,520
<29-12,RYAN>他很快就能想明白原因
<29-12,RYAN>he's gonna figure out why pretty fast.

645
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:41,880
<29-13,BECKETT>我想马科只是你案子里的小鱼小虾
<29-13,BECKETT>I'm guessing Marco's the low man on your totem pole

646
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,930
<29-13,BECKETT>而你想通过追踪
<29-13,BECKETT>and you're tracking the money

647
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:44,410
<29-13,BECKETT>他交易中的赃款
<29-13,BECKETT>from his shakedown operations

648
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:45,550
<29-13,BECKETT>来牵出你们真正的目标
<29-13,BECKETT>to get to your real target.

649
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:47,710
<29-13,BECKETT>既然如此  何不让我们介入调查
<29-13,BECKETT>So, why don't you let us in on the investigation

650
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:49,020
<29-13,BECKETT>一起合作
<29-13,BECKETT>and we can work this together?

651
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:53,210
<29-14,AGENT NAPIER>没门  不过你说得对
<29-14,AGENT NAPIER>That's not in my playbook, but you're right.

652
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:54,730
<29-14,AGENT NAPIER>马科是个小角色
<29-14,AGENT NAPIER>Marco is small potatoes.

653
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,430
<29-14,AGENT NAPIER>所以你们继续关着他
<29-14,AGENT NAPIER>So, you go ahead and keep him.

654
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:59,180
<29-14,AGENT NAPIER>只是记住  我的联邦案件优先于你的谋杀案
<29-14,AGENT NAPIER>You just remember my federal case trumps your homicide.

655
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,710
<29-14,AGENT NAPIER>别耽误我们工作
<29-14,AGENT NAPIER>So you steer clear.

656
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:09,090
<29-15,ESPOSITO>你准备让那个小白脸压在我们上面
<29-15,ESPOSITO>So, you gonna let that pretty boy steamroll us?

657
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:10,680
<29-16,BECKETT>不  如果是马科杀了埃迪
<29-16,BECKETT>No. If Marco killed Eddie,

658
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,670
<29-16,BECKETT>那我们要把他
<29-16,BECKETT>then we are gonna take him down

659
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,460
<29-16,BECKETT>和与他相关的人统统拿下
<29-16,BECKETT>along with anyone connected to him.

660
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,680
<29-16,BECKETT>但我们得谨慎行事
<29-16,BECKETT>But we have to tread lightly,

661
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,720
<29-16,BECKETT>所以我要去联系一下联调局的朋友
<29-16,BECKETT>so I'm gonna reach out to my guys in the FBI

662
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,250
<29-16,BECKETT>看他们知不知道内皮尔在查什么
<29-16,BECKETT>and see if they can tell us what Napier's up to.

663
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,530
<30-1,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<30-1,BECKETT>Castle.

664
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:26,190
<30-2,BECKETT>出了什么事
<30-2,BECKETT>Uh, what's going on?

665
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:28,290
<30-3,CASTLE>你的护照在哪儿
<30-3,CASTLE>Hey. Where's your passport?

666
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:29,990
<30-3,CASTLE>我们得去一趟韩国
<30-3,CASTLE>We've got to go to Korea.

667
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,280
<30-4,BECKETT>为什么
<30-4,BECKETT>Why?

668
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,150
<30-5,CASTLE>因为我终于明白了
<30-5,CASTLE>Because I finally figured it out.

669
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,580
<30-5,CASTLE>我失踪的那段时间
<30-5,CASTLE>My missing time?

670
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:37,080
<30-5,CASTLE>现在终于都说得通了  大部分说得通了
<30-5,CASTLE>It -- Now it all makes sense. It mostly makes sense.

671
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:37,680
<30-6,BECKETT>等一下
<30-6,BECKETT>Wait a minute, is this about

672
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,190
<30-6,BECKETT>这是因为你在教室的时候发生的事吗
<30-6,BECKETT>what happened in your classroom?

673
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:40,750
<30-7,CASTLE>我今天吃到一种食物
<30-7,CASTLE>I ate a dish today.

674
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:42,330
<30-7,CASTLE>它触发了一段记忆
<30-7,CASTLE>It triggered a memory.

675
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:45,110
<30-7,CASTLE>我在韩国  周围都是韩国人
<30-7,CASTLE>I was in Korea surrounded by locals,

676
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:46,640
<30-7,CASTLE>而且我能看到那座寺庙
<30-7,CASTLE>and I could see that temple.

677
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,430
<30-8,BECKETT>通度寺
<30-8,BECKETT>Tongdosa Temple.

678
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:50,000
<30-9,CASTLE>在庆尚南道
<30-9,CASTLE>It's in the South Gyeongsang Province.

679
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,740
<30-10,BECKETT>我们知道那时候你在泰国
<30-10,BECKETT>Okay, well, we know that you were in Thailand,

680
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:52,850
<30-10,BECKETT>所以说去过韩国也说得通
<30-10,BECKETT>so Korea's not a stretch.

681
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:54,640
<30-11,CASTLE>我一定是在泰国之后去的
<30-11,CASTLE>Yeah, I must have gone there right after.

682
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,910
<30-12,BECKETT>但是为什么
<30-12,BECKETT>But why?

683
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:58,040
<30-12,BECKETT>我完全不知道
<30-12,BECKETT>I have no idea.

684
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,320
<30-13,CASTLE>我点了更多食物希望能唤起其他回忆
<30-13,CASTLE>I-I ordered more food in hopes of jogging another memory.

685
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:01,300
<30-13,CASTLE>但是没用  不过没关系
<30-13,CASTLE>It didn't work, but that's okay.

686
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,200
<30-13,CASTLE>等我们去了韩国  所有的
<30-13,CASTLE>When we get to Korea, all the --

687
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,110
<30-14,BECKETT>不不不  卡塞尔  我不会去韩国
<30-14,BECKETT>No, no, no. Castle, I'm not going to Korea.

688
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:05,820
<30-15,CASTLE>你说得对  我应该先去  这样
<30-15,CASTLE>Yeah, you're right. I should go first. That way --

689
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,080
<30-16,BECKETT>你也不会去
<30-16,BECKETT>And neither are you.

690
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:09,040
<30-16,BECKETT>我们还没有足够的信息
<30-16,BECKETT>We don't have enough information yet.

691
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,060
<30-16,BECKETT>这太危险了  你在泰国差点丢了性命
<30-16,BECKETT>It's too dangerous. You almost got killed in Thailand.

692
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:14,040
<30-17,CASTLE>你说得对
<30-17,CASTLE>Yes, you're right.

693
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:17,080
<30-17,CASTLE>那我就努力唤起更多的记忆
<30-17,CASTLE>I'll just try to keep triggering more memories loose.

694
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,570
<30-17,CASTLE>你想吃点泡菜吗
<30-17,CASTLE>Are you in the mood for some kimchi?

695
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:21,250
<30-17,CASTLE>因为我买了大概400刀的
<30-17,CASTLE>'Cause I bought like $400 worth

696
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,290
<30-17,CASTLE>那玩意我吃了就拉出去了
<30-17,CASTLE>and...the stuff goes right through me.

697
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:27,110
<31-1,ESPOSITO>目前为止  没有什么物证
<31-1,ESPOSITO>So, so far, there's no physical evidence

698
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,990
<31-1,ESPOSITO>能把马科和埃迪的谋杀联系起来
<31-1,ESPOSITO>linking Marco to Eddie's murder.

699
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:30,580
<31-1,ESPOSITO>你联调局那边的联系人有什么消息吗
<31-1,ESPOSITO>You have any insight from your federal contacts?

700
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:31,680
<31-2,BECKETT>只知道内皮尔探员
<31-2,BECKETT>Only that Agent Napier

701
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:34,220
<31-2,BECKETT>专攻欺诈和金融犯罪
<31-2,BECKETT>specializes in fraud and financial crimes.

702
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,450
<31-3,ESPOSITO>什么时候起金融犯罪先于谋杀案
<31-3,ESPOSITO>Well, since when does financial crimes trump homicide?

703
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:37,990
<31-4,BECKETT>从来没有  就我而言
<31-4,BECKETT>Never, as far as I'm concerned.

704
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,120
<31-5,VIKRAM>谁是最性感的数码调查员
<31-5,VIKRAM>Who's the sexiest digital investigator alive?

705
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:45,010
<31-6,ESPOSITO>我是不会说是你的  哥们
<31-6,ESPOSITO>There is no way I'm saying you, bro.

706
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:49,170
<31-7,BECKETT>你查到了什么
<31-7,BECKETT>Okay. What do you got?

707
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,470
<31-7,BECKETT>安妮塔·罗德里格斯
<31-7,BECKETT>Anita Rodriguez.

708
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,960
<31-8,VIKRAM>她还活着
<31-8,VIKRAM>And she's alive.

709
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:55,760
<32-1,VIKRAM>她在德州  被关在一个私人拘留中心
<32-1,VIKRAM>She's in Texas, being held in a private detention center,

710
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,960
<32-1,VIKRAM>等待驱逐出境
<32-1,VIKRAM>awaiting deportation.

711
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,500
<32-2,CASTLE>感谢上帝她一切还好
<32-2,CASTLE>Thank God she's all right.

712
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,550
<32-3,HAYLEY>你到底是怎么找到她的
<32-3,HAYLEY>How on earth did you find her?

713
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:01,450
<32-3,HAYLEY>世界上应该有成千上万个安妮塔·罗德里格斯
<32-3,HAYLEY>There must be hundreds of Anita Rodriguezes out there.

714
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:02,860
<32-4,VIKRAM>她的指纹
<32-4,VIKRAM>Her fingerprints.

715
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:05,010
<32-4,VIKRAM>而且记录她为什么进那里的文件只有
<32-4,VIKRAM>And the paper trail for how she ended up at the facility

716
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:06,840
<32-5,BECKETT>-薄薄几页  -故意为之吗
<32-5,BECKETT>- is pretty thin. - Intentionally so?

717
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,980
<32-6,VIKRAM>也许  不过我有个可以追踪的名字
<32-6,VIKRAM>Maybe. But there was one name I could track.

718
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,810
<32-6,VIKRAM>杰森·科德维尔法官
<32-6,VIKRAM>Judge Jason Caldwell.

719
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:14,350
<32-6,VIKRAM>他签发的驱逐令  而且从他以往的记录来看
<32-6,VIKRAM>He signed the deportation order, and from his record,

720
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:15,510
<32-6,VIKRAM>这世上再没有什么比
<32-6,VIKRAM>there is nothing he likes in this world

721
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:17,560
<32-6,VIKRAM>驱逐外来人口出境更让他开心的事了
<32-6,VIKRAM>more than deporting foreigners.

722
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,310
<32-7,BECKETT>但这并不能证明
<32-7,BECKETT>But that doesn't prove

723
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,480
<32-7,BECKETT>他和埃迪的谋杀有关
<32-7,BECKETT>that he had anything to do with Eddie's murder.

724
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,600
<32-8,VIKRAM>是的  不过这个就非常有关系了
<32-8,VIKRAM>No, but this is pretty damn incriminating.

725
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,830
<32-8,VIKRAM>谋杀的前一天
<32-8,VIKRAM>The day before the murder,

726
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:26,710
<32-8,VIKRAM>我们的被害人在法院
<32-8,VIKRAM>our victim got in a shoving match with Judge Caldwell

727
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:27,690
<32-8,VIKRAM>和科德维尔法官发生争执
<32-8,VIKRAM>at the courthouse.

728
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:29,140
<32-9,HAYLEY>埃迪一定是把法官
<32-9,HAYLEY>Eddie must have connected the Judge

729
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:30,430
<32-9,HAYLEY>和马科的敲诈行为联系起来
<32-9,HAYLEY>to Marco's extortion scheme

730
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:32,120
<32-9,HAYLEY>然后去那里找他对峙
<32-9,HAYLEY>and gone down there to confront him.

731
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:35,180
<32-10,BECKETT>如果埃迪威胁要揭发他们的合谋
<32-10,BECKETT>If Eddie threatened to expose the criminal conspiracy,

732
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,530
<32-10,BECKETT>那么法官就有很强烈的动机来杀他
<32-10,BECKETT>the judge would have a strong motive to kill him.

733
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:38,370
<32-11,CASTLE>我不明白
<32-11,CASTLE>I-I don't get it.

734
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:40,130
<32-11,CASTLE>移民敲诈的好处
<32-11,CASTLE>The financial upside to extorting immigrants

735
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:41,450
<32-11,CASTLE>应该没那么高
<32-11,CASTLE>cannot be that high.

736
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:44,530
<32-11,CASTLE>一个年薪六位数的法官为什么会参与其中
<32-11,CASTLE>Why would a judge who makes six figures a year get involved?

737
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:47,820
<32-12,VIKRAM>我的想法是马科自己拿了所有敲诈的钱
<32-12,VIKRAM>My assumption is Marco kept the extortion money for himself.

738
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:48,990
<32-13,BECKETT>法官能从中得到什么
<32-13,BECKETT>What would the judge get out of it?

739
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:51,380
<32-14,VIKRAM>德州私人监狱的高额回扣
<32-14,VIKRAM>Huge kickbacks from a private prison in Texas.

740
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,740
<32-14,VIKRAM>根据科德维尔法官的财务情况
<32-14,VIKRAM>According to Judge Caldwell's financials,

741
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:53,860
<32-14,VIKRAM>他和艾尔帕索
<32-14,VIKRAM>he's got a sweetheart deal

742
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:56,220
<32-14,VIKRAM>一家经营拘留中心的公司交易地非常愉快
<32-14,VIKRAM>with a company that runs a detention center in El Paso.

743
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,860
<32-14,VIKRAM>他每填满一张床就有所回报
<32-14,VIKRAM>He literally gets paid for every bed he fills.

744
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:01,620
<32-15,HAYLEY>所以  马科敲诈移民
<32-15,HAYLEY>So, Marco shakes down the immigrants for money.

745
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:02,960
<32-15,HAYLEY>他们早晚会没有钱可付
<32-15,HAYLEY>Sooner or later, they run out of cash,

746
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,480
<32-15,HAYLEY>然后科德维尔就把他们丢到德州去
<32-15,HAYLEY>and then Caldwell ships them to Texas.

747
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,480
<32-16,BECKETT>从中获利
<32-16,BECKETT>And gets paid.

748
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:07,880
<32-17,CASTLE>我恨这个人
<32-17,CASTLE>I hate this guy.

749
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,010
<32-18,ESPOSITO>我也是  我们把他带过来
<32-18,ESPOSITO>Me too. Let's bring him in.

750
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:10,710
<32-19,BECKETT>等一下  各位  他是个联邦法官
<32-19,BECKETT>No, wait. You guys, he's a federal judge.

751
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:12,110
<32-19,BECKETT>我们不能直接去抓他
<32-19,BECKETT>We can't just go after him.

752
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:13,660
<32-19,BECKETT>如果我们错了  那我们会
<32-19,BECKETT>If we're wrong, then we'll...

753
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,960
<32-19,BECKETT>等等  放大一下监控录像
<32-19,BECKETT>Wait. Go full on the security cam.

754
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,360
<32-20,BECKETT>各位  看那个门卫
<32-20,BECKETT>You guys, look at the janitor.

755
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:22,360
<32-20,BECKETT>他带着耳机
<32-20,BECKETT>He's wearing an ear piece.

756
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:23,910
<32-21,VIKRAM>一个门卫为什么需要带耳机
<32-21,VIKRAM>Why would a janitor need an ear piece?

757
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:25,700
<32-22,ESPOSITO>那个坐在长凳上看报纸的人也带着
<32-22,ESPOSITO>So's the guy on the bench with the newspaper.

758
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:27,800
<32-23,BECKETT>这说明那是联调局的监视组
<32-23,BECKETT>Which means it's an FBI surveillance team

759
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,030
<32-23,BECKETT>负责跟踪这个法官
<32-23,BECKETT>following the judge.

760
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:30,950
<32-24,CASTLE>他一定是联调局真正的目标
<32-24,CASTLE>He must be the FBI's real target.

761
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:34,480
<32-25,BECKETT>我们不能冲着这个人去  不能在联调局的眼皮底下
<32-25,BECKETT>Oh, we can't go at this guy, not with the Feds watching.

762
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,830
<32-25,BECKETT>内皮尔明确说明
<32-25,BECKETT>Napier clearly stated

763
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:38,580
<32-25,BECKETT>我们不能破坏他的调查
<32-25,BECKETT>that we were not to step on his investigation.

764
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:40,350
<32-26,CASTLE>纽约警局不能做
<32-26,CASTLE>The NYPD can't.

765
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:42,510
<32-26,CASTLE>但我可以
<32-26,CASTLE>But I can...

766
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:45,480
<32-26,CASTLE>让我朋友帮个小忙
<32-26,CASTLE>with a little help from my friends.

<33-1,AGENT NAPIER>科德维尔出发了
<33-1,AGENT NAPIER>Caldwell is on the move.

<35-3,AGENT NAPIER>Hey, did the judge go up in the elevator?

781

<36-10,HAYLEY>我知道就是你下的手
<36-10,HAYLEY>I know you are the one who did it.

796
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,410
<36-11,CASTLE>女士听我说  你不想这么做好吗
<36-11,CASTLE>Lady, listen, you don't want to do this, all right?

<36-11,CASTLE>他  他不值得你这么做
<36-11,CASTLE>He -- He's not worth it.

<36-11,CASTLE>好  好
<36-11,CASTLE>O-Okay!

799
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,760
<36-12,CALDWELL>我知道他
<36-12,CALDWELL>I did know him,

800
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,810
<36-12,CALDWELL>但我发誓我没杀他
<36-12,CALDWELL>but I-I promise I didn't kill him.

801
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:20,160
<36-12,CALDWELL>我没必要那样做
<36-12,CALDWELL>I didn't have to.

802
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,510
<36-13,HAYLEY>什么叫你没必要那样做

<36-15,CALDWELL>这是什么  要给我下套吗
<36-15,CALDWELL>What is this, some kind of a setup?

808
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,270
<36-15,CALDWELL>你们到底是什么人
<36-15,CALDWELL>Who the hell are you people?

809
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,500
<36-16,HAYLEY>你  你最好告诉我发生了什么
<36-16,HAYLEY>You -- You had better tell me what happened

810
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,530
<36-16,HAYLEY>不然的话我就开枪了
<36-16,HAYLEY>or I'm going to shoot you.

811
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:49,980
<36-17,CALDWELL>你会才怪
<36-17,CALDWELL>The hell you will.

812
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,300
<36-18,CASTLE>让他走吧
<36-18,CASTLE>Let him go.

813
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:55,220
<36-18,CASTLE>该死  差一点就成功了
<36-18,CASTLE>Damn it. We were so close.

814
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:59,870
<36-18,CASTLE>敌人的敌人就是我的朋友
<36-18,CASTLE>The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

815
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:01,590
<37-1,ESPOSITO>你觉得是法官给埃迪在萨尔瓦多的仇家
<37-1,ESPOSITO>Do you think the judge dropped a dime

816
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:03,740
<37-1,ESPOSITO>通风报信了吗
<37-1,ESPOSITO>to one of Eddie's enemies back in El Salvador?

817
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:05,210
<37-2,RYAN>问题是法官怎么联系上
<37-2,RYAN>Question is how did the judge find out

818
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:07,170
<37-2,RYAN>埃迪在萨尔瓦多的仇家呢
<37-2,RYAN>the names of Eddie's enemies back in El Salvador?

819
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:08,320
<37-3,BECKETT>我不知道  但卡塞尔说
<37-3,BECKETT>I don't know, but Castle said

820
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,340
<37-3,BECKETT>法官提到了埃迪曾经是警察的事
<37-3,BECKETT>that the judge referenced Eddie's past as a cop.

821
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,050
<37-3,BECKETT>你们要不去查下
<37-3,BECKETT>Why don't you guys see if you can find out

822
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:15,710
<37-3,BECKETT>看能否找到在埃迪本国谁跟他有过节
<37-3,BECKETT>who had a beef with Eddie back in his home country?

823
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:16,980
<37-5,AGENT NAPIER>贝克特警监
<37-5,AGENT NAPIER>Captain Beckett.

824
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:20,930
<37-5,AGENT NAPIER>你知道你都做了些什么吗
<37-5,AGENT NAPIER>Do you have any idea what you've done?

<37-6,BECKETT>我想你会告诉我的
<37-6,BECKETT>I have a feeling you're about to tell me.

826
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,880
<38-1,AGENT NAPIER>我们就十分钟没看到科德维尔法官的踪影
<38-1,AGENT NAPIER>We lose eyes on Judge Caldwell for all of 10 minutes,

827
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:28,310
<38-1,AGENT NAPIER>然后他就取消了开庭
<38-1,AGENT NAPIER>and the next thing you know, he's cancelled court

828
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,960
<38-1,AGENT NAPIER>躲在了他的律师那
<38-1,AGENT NAPIER>and he's holed up with his lawyer.

829
00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:32,720
<38-2,BECKETT>不好意思  这法官是谁
<38-2,BECKETT>I'm sorry. Who is this judge, exactly?

830
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,070
<38-3,AGENT NAPIER>少来这一套  警监
<38-3,AGENT NAPIER>Knock it off, Captain.

831
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,790
<38-3,AGENT NAPIER>我们知道你今天早上在调查科德维尔
<38-3,AGENT NAPIER>We know you were on to Caldwell this morning.

832
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:37,740
<38-3,AGENT NAPIER>我们调出了法院的监控录像
<38-3,AGENT NAPIER>We pulled surveillance video from the courthouse.

833
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:39,760
<38-3,AGENT NAPIER>你丈夫还有他那一伙移民另类
<38-3,AGENT NAPIER>Your husband and his band of immigrant misfits

834
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,850
<38-3,AGENT NAPIER>录像中都是他们的身影
<38-3,AGENT NAPIER>are all over the footage.

<38-4,BECKETT>好的  我会让我的人去问询他们
<38-4,BECKETT>Okay, then I will make sure my guys question them.

<38-5,AGENT NAPIER>让他们每一个人都被驱逐出境
<38-5,AGENT NAPIER>having each and every one of them deported for this.

838
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:48,890
<38-6,BECKETT>不可以  你要想找人负责你就冲我来
<38-6,BECKETT>No, you want to go after someone, you go after me,

839
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:50,270
<38-6,BECKETT>不关这些人的事
<38-6,BECKETT>but leave those people alone.

840
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:51,870
<38-7,AGENT NAPIER>他们干涉联邦的调查
<38-7,AGENT NAPIER>They interfered with a federal investigation.

841
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:53,170
<38-8,BECKETT>他们的朋友被杀害了
<38-8,BECKETT>Their friend was murdered.

842
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:55,060
<38-8,BECKETT>他们希望得到正义
<38-8,BECKETT>They wanted justice,

843
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:57,480
<38-8,BECKETT>这其中也包括生活工作在这个国家
<38-8,BECKETT>which includes the ability to live and work in this country

844
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,180
<38-8,BECKETT>不被政府任命的法官或是
<38-8,BECKETT>without being victimized by a government-appointed judge

845
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:02,310
<38-8,BECKETT>急于求成的联邦调查特工伤害的权利
<38-8,BECKETT>or a power-hungry FBI agent.

846
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:05,550
<38-8,BECKETT>杀害埃迪的凶手是科德维尔法官找来的
<38-8,BECKETT>Eddie's killer was solicited by Judge Caldwell,

847
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:07,620
<38-8,BECKETT>也就是说他就是此次谋杀案的共犯
<38-8,BECKETT>which means he's complicit in the murder,

848
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:09,520
<38-8,BECKETT>你帮我指认凶手
<38-8,BECKETT>so you help me identify his killer

849
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,980
<38-8,BECKETT>我们会把这个"好"法官送进联邦监狱
<38-8,BECKETT>and we will put the good judge away in federal prison

850
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,940
<38-8,BECKETT>让他在里面度过下半辈子
<38-8,BECKETT>for the rest of his life.

851
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,170
<39-1,AGENT NAPIER>看一下阿隆索·桑切斯
<39-1,AGENT NAPIER>Meet Alonzo Sanchez,

<39-2,BECKETT>他跟你的案子之间有什么关联
<39-2,BECKETT>What's his connection to your case?

855
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:24,170
<39-3,AGENT NAPIER>科德维尔法官48小时前办了加急签证
<39-3,AGENT NAPIER>Judge Caldwell expedited his visa 48 hours ago.

856
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:26,550
<39-3,AGENT NAPIER>直到你们提到埃迪·拉米雷斯我们才确定
<39-3,AGENT NAPIER>We weren't sure why until you mentioned Eddie Ramirez.

857
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,150
<39-3,AGENT NAPIER>他们之间有过过节
<39-3,AGENT NAPIER>Turns out that they have history.

858
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,910
<39-3,AGENT NAPIER>当埃迪在萨尔瓦多当警察时
<39-3,AGENT NAPIER>Eddie killed Alonzo's brother, Mario,

859
00:34:29,910 --> 00:34:31,400
<39-3,AGENT NAPIER>他杀了阿隆索的兄弟马里奥
<39-3,AGENT NAPIER>back when he was a cop in El Salvador.

860
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,570
<39-4,ESPOSITO>敌人的敌人就是我的朋友
<39-4,ESPOSITO>The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

861
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:36,020
<39-4,ESPOSITO>他肯定就是科德维尔法官说起的那个人
<39-4,ESPOSITO>This must be who Judge Caldwell was talking about.

862
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:38,130
<39-5,BECKETT>阿隆索要找埃迪报仇
<39-5,BECKETT>Alonzo was out for revenge against Eddie,

863
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:40,080
<39-5,BECKETT>法官当然很乐意帮忙
<39-5,BECKETT>and the judge was all too happy to help.

864
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:42,670
<39-6,RYAN>阿隆索·桑切斯是在埃迪被害四小时前
<39-6,RYAN>Alonzo Sanchez landed at JFK

865
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:44,610
<39-6,RYAN>乘机降落在肯尼迪国际机场
<39-6,RYAN>four hours before Eddie was killed.

866
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:46,160
<39-7,BECKETT>好了  我们似乎找到了凶手
<39-7,BECKETT>Okay. Sounds like we have our killer.

867
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,960
<39-7,BECKETT>现在我们只要在他回国之前抓到他
<39-7,BECKETT>Now we just have to track him down before he goes back home.

868
00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:50,060
<39-8,RYAN>可能已经太迟了
<39-8,RYAN>We might be too late for that.

869
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,140
<39-8,RYAN>他15分钟前就登机了
<39-8,RYAN>He boarded a flight 15 minutes ago.

870
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:54,090
<39-8,RYAN>-他已经在飞机上了  -那我们完了
<39-8,RYAN>- He's already in the air. - Well, then we're done.

871
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:55,730
<39-9,ESPOSITO>我们现在没法抓到他了
<39-9,ESPOSITO>There's no way we can get him now.

872
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:58,850
<39-9,ESPOSITO>你们不可以  但是我行
<39-9,ESPOSITO>Uh, you can't, but I can.

<39-10,AGENT NAPIER>我需要让一架飞机返程
<39-10,AGENT NAPIER>I need to turn a plane around.

875
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,220
<40-1,BECKETT>阿隆索很遗憾你的飞机改航了
<40-1,BECKETT>It's too bad your plane got rerouted, Alonzo.

876
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:14,200
<40-1,BECKETT>但好的一面就是  我跟航空公司说了
<40-1,BECKETT>On the bright side, I spoke to the airline,

<40-1,BECKETT>你的飞行里程将会保留
<40-1,BECKETT>and you're still gonna get the miles.

<40-2,ALONZO SANCHEZ>你根本就没证据
<40-2,ALONZO SANCHEZ>You got nothing on me.

<40-2,ALONZO SANCHEZ>我合法地来到这里
<40-2,ALONZO SANCHEZ>I was here legally.

00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:21,320
<40-3,AGENT NAPIER>你的旅行目的是什么
<40-3,AGENT NAPIER>And what was the purpose of your trip?

00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:22,350
<40-4,ALONZO>拜访一位老朋友
<40-4,ALONZO>Visiting an old friend.

882
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:24,700
<40-5,BECKETT>拜访他还是拿他喂了蛇
<40-5,BECKETT>Visiting or feeding him to the snakes?

883
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:26,370
<40-6,ALONZO>什么

<40-7,AGENT NAPIER>我们知道你是为了埃迪·拉米雷斯而来
<40-7,AGENT NAPIER>We know you came here for Eddie Ramirez.

<40-7,AGENT NAPIER>科德维尔法官  他帮你来到这里
<40-7,AGENT NAPIER>And Judge Caldwell -- He greased the wheels to get you up here.

<40-8,ALONZO>什么法官
<40-8,ALONZO>Judge who?

<40-8,ALONZO>我不知道你在说什么  先生
<40-8,ALONZO>I don't know what you're talking about, man.

<40-9,BECKETT>我们找到了那个出租车司机
<40-9,BECKETT>We tracked down the cab driver

891

00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:44,200
<40-10,ALONZO>埃迪死了吗

00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:46,840
<40-10,ALONZO>不是我干的
<40-10,ALONZO>That wasn't me.

895
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,500
<40-10,ALONZO>好吧  那个法官是联系我了
<40-10,ALONZO>Okay, the judge reached out to me,

00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:53,280
<40-10,ALONZO>是的  我去动物园找埃迪了
<40-10,ALONZO>and, yes, I went to the zoo to see Eddie,

897
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,920
<40-10,ALONZO>但是我没杀他
<40-10,ALONZO>but I did not kill him.

898
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:56,380
<40-11,AGENT NAPIER>那你去那里干什么了
<40-11,AGENT NAPIER>So, what did you come up here for, then?

899
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:57,640
<40-11,AGENT NAPIER>友好地聊天
<40-11,AGENT NAPIER>Little friendly chat?

900
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,390
<40-11,AGENT NAPIER>缘分天注定餐厅来份冰心巧克力
<40-11,AGENT NAPIER>Maybe a frozen hot chocolate at Serendipity?

901
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:02,150
<40-12,ALONZO>我是抱着复仇之心去的
<40-12,ALONZO>I came here with revenge in my heart.

902
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:03,720
<40-12,ALONZO>我以为埃迪要为
<40-12,ALONZO>I thought that Eddie was responsible

903
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,110
<40-12,ALONZO>我弟弟的死负责
<40-12,ALONZO>for my brother's death.

904
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:06,800
<40-12,ALONZO>但是我搞错了
<40-12,ALONZO>But I was wrong.

905
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,360
<40-12,ALONZO>埃迪说服我他是在和我弟弟
<40-12,ALONZO>Eddie convinced me that he had been working with my brother

906
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,360
<40-12,ALONZO>秘密合作  暗中保护他
<40-12,ALONZO>in secret, protecting him.

907
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,680
<40-13,BECKETT>如果你正准备要杀埃迪的话
<40-13,BECKETT>Eddie would tell you anything

908
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:13,660
<40-13,BECKETT>他说什么都正常
<40-13,BECKETT>if he thought you were gonna kill him.

909
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:15,320
<40-13,BECKETT>你因为什么相信了他的话
<40-13,BECKETT>so what made you believe him?

910
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:17,870
<40-14,ALONZO>埃迪知道马里奥的一些私事
<40-14,ALONZO>Eddie knew things about Mario

911
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:20,100
<40-14,ALONZO>只有他身边亲近的人才会知道这些
<40-14,ALONZO>that only someone close to my brother would know,

912
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:23,290
<40-14,ALONZO>他的态度也不像是为了保命而说谎
<40-14,ALONZO>and his attitude wasn't that of a man lying to save his life.

913
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,210
<40-15,BECKETT>这话是什么意思
<40-15,BECKETT>What do you mean by that?

914
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:26,640
<40-16,ALONZO>埃迪痛恨自己在萨尔瓦多的所作所为
<40-16,ALONZO>Eddie hated the man that he was back in El Salvador.

915
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,270
<40-16,ALONZO>他保护我弟弟的所作所为让他很有压力
<40-16,ALONZO>What he did to protect my brother weighed on him.

916
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:32,330
<40-16,ALONZO>他对我说他鄙视我家人的所作所为
<40-16,ALONZO>He told me that he despised everything my family stands for,

917
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:33,910
<40-16,ALONZO>以及他的过往
<40-16,ALONZO>what he used to stand for.

918
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:36,050
<40-16,ALONZO>所以他来到了美国
<40-16,ALONZO>That's why he came to America --

919
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:38,960
<40-16,ALONZO>为了重新开始  在这里建立新生活
<40-16,ALONZO>to start over, build a new life here.

920
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,750
<40-17,BECKETT>他确实做到了  直到有人夺走了他的生命
<40-17,BECKETT>And he did until somebody took it away from him.

921
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:55,310
<41-3,BECKET>阿隆索的不在场证明排除了他的嫌疑
<41-3,BECKET>So, Alonzo alibied out.

922
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:57,930
<41-3,BECKET>看来我们认为科德维尔法官参与其中是错的
<41-3,BECKET>Looks like we were wrong about Judge Caldwell's involvement.

923
00:36:57,930 --> 00:36:59,840
<41-4,CASTLE>不对  我们漏掉了什么
<41-4,CASTLE>No. We're missing something.

924
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:02,800
<41-4,CASTLE>埃迪和法官对质  第二天就被杀害了
<41-4,CASTLE>Eddie confronted the judge, and the next day, he was killed.

925
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,970
<41-5,BECKETT>我们知道不是法官杀的人
<41-5,BECKETT>Well, we know it wasn't the judge.

926
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:06,020
<41-5,BECKETT>他被24小时监控
<41-5,BECKETT>He was under 24-hour surveillance.

927
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:07,000
<41-5,BECKETT>再者说  他以为
<41-5,BECKETT>And besides, he thought that

928
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,710
<41-5,BECKETT>阿隆索会把他处理掉的
<41-5,BECKETT>Alonzo was gonna take care of it.

929
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:10,960
<41-6,CASTLE>埃迪和法官对质
<41-6,CASTLE>Eddie confronts the judge.

930
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:14,570
<41-6,CASTLE>12小时之后  阿隆索就持着合法签证上了飞机
<41-6,CASTLE>12 hours later, Alonzo's on a plane with an approved visa.

931
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,580
<41-7,BECKETT>法官是怎么知道阿隆索的
<41-7,BECKETT>How did the judge even know about Alonzo?

932
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:19,850
<41-6,CASTLE>-谁告诉他的  -你说的对
<41-6,CASTLE>- Who told him? - No, you're right.

933
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:21,110
<41-7,BECKETT>我们都不知道阿隆索
<41-7,BECKETT>We didn't even know about Alonzo.

934
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:22,540
<41-7,BECKETT>法官是怎么这么快发现的
<41-7,BECKETT>How did the judge find out so quickly?

935
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,410
<41-8,CASTLE>这场阴谋肯定还有其他人参与
<41-8,CASTLE>There has to be someone else involved in this conspiracy,

936
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:25,690
<41-8,CASTLE>和埃迪关系很近的人
<41-8,CASTLE>someone close to Eddie.

937
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:29,370
<41-9,BECKETT>和他关系近的只有英语二外班的那些人
<41-9,BECKETT>The only people that are close to him are in the ESL class.

938
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:31,520
<41-9,BECKETT>那么谁会杀了他呢
<41-9,BECKETT>So, who would kill him?

939
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,380
<41-9,BECKETT>我想我知道了
<41-9,BECKETT>I think I know.

940
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:36,610
<41-10,CASTLE>你知道这意味着什么吗  贝克特
<41-10,CASTLE>And you know what this means, Beckett.

941
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:39,200
<41-10,CASTLE>过了这么多年  我终于有机会说
<41-10,CASTLE>After all these years, I finally get to say,

942
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,380
<41-10,CASTLE>"我强烈谴责"[法语]了
<41-10,CASTLE>"J'accuse."

943
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:46,190
<42-1,EMERSON>现在我们重点讲动词
<42-1,EMERSON>So, we're gonna focus in on the verbs.

944
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,040
<42-1,EMERSON>现在  如果我们"以前去过"
<42-1,EMERSON>Now, if we had --

946
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,080
<42-1,EMERSON>让-吕克  你迟到了
<42-1,EMERSON>Jean-Luc, you're late.

947
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:51,880
<42-2,CASTLE>是的  先生
<42-2,CASTLE>Ah, oui, monsieur.

948
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,070
<42-2,CASTLE>不好意思
<42-2,CASTLE>Pardonnez-moi.

949
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:54,690
<42-3,EMERSON>没关系  坐下吧
<42-3,EMERSON>That's all right. Have a seat.

950
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,780
<42-4,EMERSON>实际上  埃莫森先生
<42-4,EMERSON>Actually, Monsieur Emerson,

951
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:05,080
<42-4,EMERSON>我能和你私下聊几句吗
<42-4,EMERSON>if I could just have a word with you in private,

952
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,050
<42-4,EMERSON>如果你愿意的话
<42-4,EMERSON>s'il vous plait?

953
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:07,330
<42-5,EMERSON>当然
<42-5,EMERSON>Sure.

954
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:15,790
<43-1,EMERSON>让-吕克  是你把他们带来的吗
<43-1,EMERSON>Jean-Luc, did you bring these men here?

955
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:17,240
<43-2,CASTLE>是的  他们和我一起的
<43-2,CASTLE>Oh, yeah. They're with me.

956
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:19,840
<43-2,CASTLE>他们是为了埃迪·拉米雷斯的谋杀案来逮捕你的
<43-2,CASTLE>They're here to arrest you for the murder of Eddie Ramirez.

957
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,550
<43-3,EMERSON>什么
<43-3,EMERSON>What?

958
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:22,780
<43-4,ESPOSITO>我们知道了你在和科德维尔法官合作
<43-4,ESPOSITO>We know you were working with Judge Caldwell,

959
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:24,490
<43-4,ESPOSITO>给他提供学校里的移民信息
<43-4,ESPOSITO>funneling him immigrants from the school

960
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:26,760
<43-4,ESPOSITO>以此在敲诈费里分一杯羹
<43-4,ESPOSITO>in exchange for a cut of the extortion money.

961
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,250
<43-5,RYAN>你知道他们每个人面临的压力
<43-5,RYAN>You knew each one of their pressure points,

962
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:29,570
<43-5,RYAN>哪些人是非法移民
<43-5,RYAN>which ones were illegal.

963
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,410
<43-6,EMERSON>太荒唐了
<43-6,EMERSON>That's absurd.

964
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:32,130
<43-6,EMERSON>是吗
<43-6,EMERSON>Oh, is it?

965
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:33,960
<43-7,RYAN>那为什么你的学生中
<43-7,RYAN>Then why are so many of your students

966
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:35,380
<43-7,RYAN>有那么多都被私人拘留所扣押了呢
<43-7,RYAN>in those private detention centers?

967
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,710
<43-7,RYAN>太多了  不可能是巧合
<43-7,RYAN>Too many to be a coincidence.

968
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:38,830
<43-8,CASTLE>真是个可靠的计划  谁会注意呢
<43-8,CASTLE>It was a solid plan. I mean, who's gonna notice?

969
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:41,820
<43-8,CASTLE>他们都孤身一人  徘徊在社会边缘
<43-8,CASTLE>They're here alone, marginalized by society.

970
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:43,430
<43-8,CASTLE>如果我在你的位置也会这么做的
<43-8,CASTLE>In your position, I would have done the same thing.

971
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:45,250
<43-9,ESPOSITO>-你不会的  -是啊  我才不会呢
<43-9,ESPOSITO>- No, you wouldn't. - No, I would not.

972
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:47,690
<43-10,CASTLE>-我是有良心的  -走吧
<43-10,CASTLE>- I have a soul. - Come on. Let's go.

973
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:04,480
<44-1,CASTLE>各位  我有好消息
<44-1,CASTLE>Everyone, I have some good news.

974
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:07,070
<44-1,CASTLE>安妮塔·罗德里格斯被释放了
<44-1,CASTLE>Anita Rodriguez has been released.

975
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:09,860
<44-1,CASTLE>联邦已经派人调查了
<44-1,CASTLE>And a federal investigation has been launched

976
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:12,470
<44-1,CASTLE>扣押她的拘留所
<44-1,CASTLE>into the private detention facility that was holding her.

977
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:14,190
<44-3,ACHMED>法官怎么样了
<44-3,ACHMED>What about the judge?

978
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:16,500
<44-4,CASTLE>你们的老师出卖了他  他把一切都坦白了
<44-4,CASTLE>Your teacher sold him out. He confessed everything.

979
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:19,210
<44-4,CASTLE>现在联邦调查局可以合法检举法官
<44-4,CASTLE>Now the FBI can properly prosecute the judge,

980
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:20,760
<44-4,CASTLE>正义得到了伸张
<44-4,CASTLE>and justice has been served.

981
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,820
<44-4,CASTLE>太好了  对不对
<44-4,CASTLE>C'est magnifique, huh?

982
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:27,190
<44-5,AIDA>但是剩下的课谁来教我们呢
<44-5,AIDA>Oh, but, uh, who will finish teaching us now?

983
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:30,460
<44-6,KIM>我在网站上看到是卡塞尔先生
<44-6,KIM>I saw on the website it's Mr. Castle.

<44-7,CASTLE>对不起

<44-7,CASTLE>I have no idea how that got on there.

986
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:41,280
<44-8,HAYLEY>我知道  只是补位的卡塞尔不是先生
<44-8,HAYLEY>I do, only the Castle who will be filling in isn't a mister.

1002
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:16,540

1003
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:18,410
<44-19,MARTHA>塑造了今天的我们
