3
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:06,340
<1-1,KATE BECKETT>天呐  杀了我得了
<1-1,KATE BECKETT>Oh, god. Shoot me now.

5
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,880
<1-2,RICHARD CASTLE>不要啊
<1-2,RICHARD CASTLE>I'd rather not.

6
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:10,470
<1-2,RICHARD CASTLE>怎么了
<1-2,RICHARD CASTLE>What's up?

8
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,130
<1-3,BECKETT>安森·克莱普被晋升为警监了
<1-3,BECKETT>Anson Klemp has just been promoted to captain.

9
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:14,720
<1-3,BECKETT>他会负责92分局
<1-3,BECKETT>He's gonna run the 9-2.

10
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:18,380
<1-4,CASTLE>安森·克莱普是谁  名字这么傻还不改吗
<1-4,CASTLE>Who's Anson Klemp, and why hasn't he changed his name?

11
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:19,910
<1-5,BECKETT>我们是警校同学
<1-5,BECKETT>We went to the academy together.

12
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,350
<1-6,CASTLE>他是你的死敌吗
<1-6,CASTLE>And he's your sworn nemesis.

13
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:23,420
<1-7,BECKETT>不  他是我朋友
<1-7,BECKETT>No. He was my friend.

14
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:24,810
<1-8,CASTLE>他很不称职吗
<1-8,CASTLE>So he's grossly underqualified?

15
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:26,070
<1-9,BECKETT>不  他很棒
<1-9,BECKETT>No. He's great.

16
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,230
<1-10,CASTLE>那问题在哪里
<1-10,CASTLE>So, then, what's the problem?

17
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:28,980
<1-10,CASTLE>在我
<1-10,CASTLE>Me.

18
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:33,550
<1-11,BECKETT>我们一起入校  一起毕业
<1-11,BECKETT>We started together, we graduated the same year,

19
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:35,390
<1-11,BECKETT>他要当警监了  我还是...
<1-11,BECKETT>and he's gonna be captain, and I'm just...

20
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:37,300
<1-12,CASTLE>全市最棒的凶案组探长
<1-12,CASTLE>The best homicide detective in the city?

21
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:39,300
<1-13,BECKETT>不  落后于人
<1-13,BECKETT>No. Falling behind.

22
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:46,010
<2-1,CASTLE>你知道你这叫什么吗  帕特森综合征
<2-1,CASTLE>You know what you've got? Patterson syndrome.

23
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:47,520
<2-2,BECKETT>帕特森综合征
<2-2,BECKETT>Patterson syndrome?

24
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,320
<2-3,CASTLE>对  每次我写出了一本畅销小说
<2-3,CASTLE>Yeah, every time I write a bestseller,

25
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,160
<2-3,CASTLE>帕特森能写六本
<2-3,CASTLE>Patterson writes like six.

26
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,030
<2-3,CASTLE>让我抓狂死了
<2-3,CASTLE>It's maddening.

27
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,750
<2-3,CASTLE>但跟他比较
<2-3,CASTLE>But comparing myself to him

28
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,470
<2-3,CASTLE>也不能让我写得更快
<2-3,CASTLE>does not make me write any faster.

29
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:57,350
<2-4,BECKETT>我想我就是以为
<2-4,BECKETT>I guess I just thought that I would be

30
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,970
<2-4,BECKETT>我到了这时能坐在领导层的位置上了
<2-4,BECKETT>in more of a leadership position by now.

31
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,420
<2-4,BECKETT>我也说不清
<2-4,BECKETT>I don't know.

32
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:04,370
<2-4,BECKETT>或许我不该离开华盛顿的总检察长办公室
<2-4,BECKETT>Maybe I shouldn't have left the A.G.'s office in D.C.

33
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:07,130
<2-5,CASTLE>但你不想为了配合他们而委屈了自己
<2-5,CASTLE>Except you didn't want to compromise yourself to play their game.

34
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,160
<2-6,BECKETT>我就是觉得
<2-6,BECKETT>Well, I feel like

35
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,040
<2-6,BECKETT>或许我该能做到更多
<2-6,BECKETT>maybe there's something more I should be doing.

36
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:12,640
<2-7,KEVIN RYAN>卡塞尔夫妇早啊
<2-7,KEVIN RYAN>Hey, Castles.

37
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,050
<2-7,KEVIN RYAN>被害人是亨利·格莱姆
<2-7,KEVIN RYAN>Our victim is one Henry Graham.

38
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:17,380
<2-7,KEVIN RYAN>午夜左右胸部中枪
<2-7,KEVIN RYAN>Took a single GSW to the chest around midnight.

39
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,950
<2-8,BECKETT>那肯定有人听到枪响吧
<2-8,BECKETT>So someone must have heard the gunshot.

40
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:19,550
<2-8,BECKETT>有目击证人吗
<2-8,BECKETT>Do we have a witness?

41
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:20,620
<2-9,RYAN>事实上  有
<2-9,RYAN>As a matter of fact, yes...

42
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:21,750
<2-9,RYAN>那个跑步的人
<2-9,RYAN>That jogger right there.

43
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,790
<2-10,BECKETT>他看到凶案了吗
<2-10,BECKETT>Did he see the murder?

44
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,740
<2-11,RYAN>没有  但他跑近的时候
<2-11,RYAN>No, but the killer was still looking

45
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,780
<2-11,RYAN>凶手还在翻死者的兜
<2-11,RYAN>through the vic's pockets when he jogged up.

46
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,000
<2-12,CASTLE>-我很惊讶他居然没被打死  -他也很惊讶
<2-12,CASTLE>- I'm surprised he didn't get shot, too. - So is he.

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,670
<2-13,RYAN>她本可以控制他  却叫他跑
<2-13,RYAN>She had the drop on him but told him to run...

48
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:33,220
<2-13,RYAN>大概都跑出个人最好成绩了
<2-13,RYAN>Probably set a personal best.

49
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:34,590
<2-14,BECKETT>是个女的吗
<2-14,BECKETT>Our killer's a she?

50
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:37,490
<2-15,RYAN>亚裔女性  三十多  衣着不错
<2-15,RYAN>Asian female, mid-30s, well-dressed.

51
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,690
<2-16,CASTLE>不像一般的抢劫犯啊
<2-16,CASTLE>Doesn't fit the profile of a typical mugger.

52
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:40,780
<2-17,RYAN>她从被害人兜里
<2-17,RYAN>Neither does the stuff

53
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,440
<2-17,RYAN>拿走的东西也不符合常规
<2-17,RYAN>that she took from the vic's pockets.

54
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,730
<2-17,RYAN>她拿走了他的手机和钥匙
<2-17,RYAN>She made off with his cellphone and his keys

55
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:47,140
<2-17,RYAN>但没拿走钱包和两百块的现金
<2-17,RYAN>but left his wallet and 200 bucks in cash.

56
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,930
<2-18,BECKETT>那么这不是一起简单的深夜抢劫
<2-18,BECKETT>So this was more than just a late-night stick-up.

57
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,750
<2-20,BECKETT>叫目击者跟速写师画张疑犯画像吧
<2-20,BECKETT>Why don't we get the witness together with a sketch artist?

58
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,040
<2-21,JAVIER ESPOSITO>已经在办了
<2-21,JAVIER ESPOSITO>Already in the works.

59
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:56,010
<2-21,JAVIER ESPOSITO>听跑步者的意思
<2-21,JAVIER ESPOSITO>And to hear the jogger tell it,

60
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,190
<2-21,JAVIER ESPOSITO>那小妞相当冷静
<2-21,JAVIER ESPOSITO>this chick was cool as can be.

61
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,430
<2-21,JAVIER ESPOSITO>她可能是职业杀手
<2-21,JAVIER ESPOSITO>She may be a pro.

62
00:02:58,950 --> 00:02:59,860
<2-22,CASTLE>那么问题来了
<2-22,CASTLE>Does raise the question...

63
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,920
<2-22,CASTLE>亨利这么晚在这里做什么
<2-22,CASTLE>what was Henry doing here so late at night?

64
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,910
<2-23,RYAN>等人
<2-23,RYAN>Waiting for someone.

65
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,420
<2-23,RYAN>鉴证组找到了
<2-23,RYAN>CSU found cigarette butts

66
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,240
<2-23,RYAN>跟他兜里的一样牌子的烟头
<2-23,RYAN>that match the pack in his pocket.

67
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,000
<2-24,ESPOSITO>如果他的确在搞什么鬼
<2-24,ESPOSITO>And if he was up to no good,

68
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,200
<2-24,ESPOSITO>也不会是第一次了
<2-24,ESPOSITO>it wouldn't be his first time.

69
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,780
<2-24,ESPOSITO>他因重伤罪在埃尔迈拉蹲过监狱
<2-24,ESPOSITO>He did a nickel at Elmira for aggravated assault...

70
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:13,940
<2-24,ESPOSITO>几年前才出狱
<2-24,ESPOSITO>Got out a few years ago.

71
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:18,770
<2-25,BECKETT>他还穿着工作服
<2-25,BECKETT>He's still got his work uniform on,

72
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:20,840
<2-25,BECKETT>去迅捷拖车看看有没有人知道
<2-25,BECKETT>so let's see if anyone at Go Quick Towing

73
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:22,890
<2-25,BECKETT>-他怎么会跑来这里  -走吧
<2-25,BECKETT>- knows how he wound up here. - Let's go.

74
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:27,300
<2-25,BECKETT>我能告诉你他不是在办公事
<2-25,BECKETT>He wasn't on the job, I can tell you that.

75
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:28,680
<3-1,BECKETT>我们没接过那里的活儿
<3-1,BECKETT>We didn't have any pickups out that way,

76
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:30,330
<3-1,BECKETT>我也不知道他为什么在那里
<3-1,BECKETT>so I don't know what he was doing there.

77
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:31,220
<3-1,BECKETT>谁会知道
<3-1,BECKETT>Well, who would?

78
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,000
<3-1,BECKETT>他有亲人吗
<3-1,BECKETT>Did he have any family?

79
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,860
<2-13,RYAN>没有
<2-13,RYAN>He doesn't.

80
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,520
<2-14,BECKETT>好像连女朋友都没有
<2-14,BECKETT>He didn't even have a girl, I don't think.

81
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,560
<2-15,RYAN>可怜人
<2-15,RYAN>Poor guy.

82
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,200
<2-16,CASTLE>我真是缓不过劲
<2-16,CASTLE>I don't know. I just... I just can't get over it.

83
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:43,210
<2-17,RYAN>亨利是我最好的司机
<2-17,RYAN>Henry was my top driver.

84
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:45,380
<2-18,BECKETT>是个不错的家伙
<2-18,BECKETT>Just a... just a real stand-up guy.

85
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,720
<3-2,CASTLE>-即便他有案底吗  -我也有
<3-2,CASTLE>- Even though he had a record? - So do I.

86
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,260
<3-2,CASTLE>释放犯人找工作比较困难
<3-2,CASTLE>There's not a lot of jobs out there for ex-cons.

87
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,510
<3-2,CASTLE>但亨利脱离了过去
<3-2,CASTLE>But Henry, he, uh, he was out of the life,

88
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:55,800
<3-3,BECKETT>所以我给了他个机会  我从没为此后悔过
<3-3,BECKETT>so I gave him a shot, and I never regretted it.

89
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:57,500
<3-3,BECKETT>你知道他跟谁有矛盾吗
<3-3,BECKETT>Did he have problems with anyone that you know of?

90
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,580
<12-7,MIMI>嗯  亨利每天都受到生命威胁
<12-7,MIMI>Oh, yeah. Henry got threatened every day.

91
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,940
<3-4,CASTLE>是吗  谁威胁他
<3-4,CASTLE>He did? By whom?

92
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,160
<3-4,CASTLE>什么人都有
<3-4,CASTLE>All kinds of people.

93
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,340
<3-5,BECKETT>挥球棒的  动刀的  动枪的  都有
<3-5,BECKETT>Waving bats, knives, guns... you name it.

94
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,990
<3-5,BECKETT>等等  他不是拖车司机吗
<3-5,BECKETT>Wait a minute. I thought that he was a tow-truck driver.

95
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:09,680
<3-6,CASTLE>专门负责汽车回收
<3-6,CASTLE>Specializing in vehicle recovery.

96
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,850
<3-6,CASTLE>亨利负责回收啊
<3-6,CASTLE>Henry was a repo man?

97
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,720
<3-6,CASTLE>大伙儿可不喜欢
<3-6,CASTLE>And folks aren't that excited

98
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,180
<3-6,CASTLE>我们拿走他们的车
<3-6,CASTLE>when we take their cars away.

99
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,690
<3-7,BECKETT>那么他受到的威胁
<3-7,BECKETT>So, these threats that he got...

100
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:19,100
<3-7,BECKETT>有没有哪个来自亚裔女性
<3-7,BECKETT>Did any of them ever come from an Asian woman?

101
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,650
<3-7,BECKETT>我记得是没有
<3-7,BECKETT>Not that I can remember.

102
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,630
<3-7,BECKETT>但听我说  探长
<3-7,BECKETT>But listen, detective,

103
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,260
<3-7,BECKETT>我们遇到的一些人很生气
<3-7,BECKETT>some of the people we deal with are pissed off,

104
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:27,000
<32-1,CASTLE>但他们气的是银行  不是我们
<32-1,CASTLE>but they're mad at the banks, not us.

105
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,580
<32-2,BECKETT>我无法相信
<32-2,BECKETT>I mean, I can't believe

106
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,300
<32-2,BECKETT>会有人找到亨利杀了他
<32-2,BECKETT>anyone would hunt Henry down to kill him.

107
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,160
<26-1,ZHANG>但我们还是需要车辆被回收的人的名单
<26-1,ZHANG>Still, we'll need a list of the repos.

108
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,590
<26-2,CASTLE>嗯  好
<26-2,CASTLE>Yeah. Sure.

109
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:36,160
<26-3,ZHANG>等等
<26-3,ZHANG>Wait a minute.

110
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,260
<26-4,CASTLE>或许这事跟
<26-4,CASTLE>Maybe this has something to do with

111
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,330
<26-5,ZHANG>昨天午饭时发生的事有关
<26-5,ZHANG>what happened yesterday at lunch.

112
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:41,920
<29-20,ZHANG>怎么回事
<29-20,ZHANG>What do you mean?

113
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,780
<29-21,BECKETT>他像往常那样出去吃午饭
<29-21,BECKETT>Well, he went out to lunch like he normally does,

114
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:47,040
<29-22,ZHANG>他回来的时候  吓得不轻
<29-22,ZHANG>and when he came back, he was all shook up.

115
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,600
<20-12,BECKETT>-是什么事  -他不肯说
<20-12,BECKETT>- What about? - He wouldn't say.

116
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,280
<20-13,GATES>他班没上完就走了  招呼都不打
<20-13,GATES>He left mid-shift, without a word.

117
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:53,320
<26-9,ZHANG>他离开了车场  再没回来
<26-9,ZHANG>And he left the yard, didn't come back.

118
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:54,590
<26-10,BECKETT>我就再没见到他了
<26-10,BECKETT>That was the last I ever saw him.

119
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,820
<26-11,RYAN>他午饭去哪里吃的
<26-11,RYAN>And where exactly did he go to lunch?

120
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:57,820
<26-12,ESPOSITO>我不知道
<26-12,ESPOSITO>I don't know,

121
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,280
<26-13,RYAN>但还有一件怪事
<26-13,RYAN>but there was something else he did that was strange.

122
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,260
<26-14,CASTLE>我们负责车锁的人告诉我亨利
<26-14,CASTLE>My alarm guy told me that Henry was asking

123
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:06,460
<26-13,RYAN>几天前曾问他要2013X5的警报码
<26-13,RYAN>for access codes to a 2013 x5 a few days ago.

124
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:07,440
<26-13,RYAN>这怎么了
<26-13,RYAN>What was strange about that?

125
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,920
<26-13,RYAN>我们回收清单上没有2013X5
<26-13,RYAN>We don't have any 2013 X5s on our repo list.

126
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,860
<26-13,RYAN>我问过亨利的同事
<26-13,RYAN>So, I spoke to Henry's colleagues.

127
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,470
<4-1,BECKETT>他们都不知道他昨天去哪吃了午饭
<4-1,BECKETT>None of them knows where he went to lunch yesterday

128
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:22,230
<4-1,BECKETT>也不知道他为什么问起X5的警报码
<4-1,BECKETT>or why he was asking for the x5 codes.

129
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:25,540
<4-2,CASTLE>或许回收员其实是在偷车
<4-2,CASTLE>Maybe our repo man was actually stealing cars.

130
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,620
<4-2,CASTLE>他显然有这个本事
<4-2,CASTLE>He clearly had the skill set.

131
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,180
<4-3,BECKETT>可是其他所有人都说
<4-3,BECKETT>Yeah, but from everything that everyone said,

132
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:30,480
<4-3,BECKETT>包括亨利之前的保释官
<4-3,BECKETT>including Henry's former parole officer,

133
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,340
<4-3,BECKETT>也说他是个守法的好公民
<4-3,BECKETT>he was just a stand-up citizen.

134
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:34,570
<4-3,BECKETT>那也是因为他隐瞒了
<4-3,BECKETT>Yeah, that's because he was concealing

135
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:36,240
<4-4,CASTLE>他在偷车的事
<4-4,CASTLE>his car-stealing ways.

136
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,740
<4-4,CASTLE>连他的老板都说他是个独来独往的人
<4-4,CASTLE>Even his boss said he was a very private guy.

137
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:42,090
<4-4,CASTLE>没人知道  亨利把目标瞄准了那辆X5
<4-4,CASTLE>So, unbeknownst to anyone, Henry sets his eyes on an X5.

138
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:43,180
<4-4,CASTLE>他拿到了警报码
<4-4,CASTLE>He gets the alarm codes.

139
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,650
<4-4,CASTLE>可这是个致命的错误
<4-4,CASTLE>But, in a fateful error,

140
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:48,530
<4-4,CASTLE>他偷的这辆X5是属于这个女人的...
<4-4,CASTLE>he steals the X5 belonging to this woman --

141
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:49,940
<4-5,BECKETT>一个三合会杀手
<4-5,BECKETT>A triad assassin.

142
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,090
<4-5,BECKETT>杀手
<4-5,BECKETT>An assassin?

143
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,120
<4-5,BECKETT>真的  又来
<4-5,BECKETT>Really? Again?

144
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:55,140
<4-6,CASTLE>拜托  这次对的上
<4-6,CASTLE>Come on. This time, it fits.

145
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,090
<4-7,BECKETT>怎么对的上了
<4-7,BECKETT>How does it fit?

146
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:58,170
<4-7,BECKETT>他偷了她的车  她就把他杀了
<4-7,BECKETT>He steals her car, and she kills him?

147
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:00,980
<4-7,BECKETT>她为什么不直接向保险公司报告了事
<4-7,BECKETT>Why doesn't she just put in an insurance claim and call it a day?

148
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:03,730
<4-8,CASTLE>因为这并不仅仅是车的问题
<4-8,CASTLE>Because it wasn't about the car.

149
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,660
<4-8,CASTLE>亨利偷了这辆车之后
<4-8,CASTLE>See, when Henry stole the vehicle,

150
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,520
<4-8,CASTLE>他拿走了车里非常有价值的东西
<4-8,CASTLE>he took something of value from the inside.

151
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:10,200
<4-8,CASTLE>也就是那个杀手在他口袋里找的东西
<4-8,CASTLE>That's what the assassin was trying to retrieve from his pocket.

152
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,280
<4-9,BECKETT>那被偷的东西又是什么呢
<4-9,BECKETT>And said stolen item was...?

153
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:14,550
<4-10,CASTLE>低温核融合技术
<4-10,CASTLE>Cold fusion technology.

154
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:16,110
<4-10,CASTLE>基因工程改造过的超级病毒
<4-10,CASTLE>A genetically engineered super-virus.

155
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,610
<4-10,CASTLE>尚未公布的《哈利·波特》秘密手稿
<4-10,CASTLE>Some secret unpublished "Harry Potter" manuscript.

156
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,880
<4-11,BECKETT>其实你说的有一件事情还有点道理
<4-11,BECKETT>Actually, one thing that you said does make sense.

157
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,570
<4-12,CASTLE>只有一个
<4-12,CASTLE>One thing?

158
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:24,780
<4-13,BECKET>那辆X5应该和亨利的死有关
<4-13,BECKET>The X5 might have something to do with Henry's death.

159
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,640
<4-13,BECKET>我要打电话给车辆报失部
<4-13,BECKET>You know what -- I'm gonna call auto theft

160
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,890
<4-13,BECKET>看看最近有没有报告失窃的X5
<4-13,BECKET>and see if there are any reported stolen X5s recently.

161
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,080
<4-14,CASTLE>车主是个三合会杀手
<4-14,CASTLE>From a triad assassin.

162
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,500
<4-15,BECKETT>她才不是三合会杀手
<4-15,BECKETT>She's not a triad assassin.

163
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,640
<4-16,CASTLE>这个可不好说
<4-16,CASTLE>We don't know that.

164
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,530
<5-1,GLADYS>这真是太可怕了  亨利是个非常好的人
<5-1,GLADYS>This is just so terrible. Henry was such a decent man.

165
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:38,340
<5-1,GLADYS>真希望所有房客都能和他一样
<5-1,GLADYS>I wish all my tenants were like him.

166
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,300
<5-2,RYAN>是啊
<5-2,RYAN>I'm sure you do.

167
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,130
<5-2,RYAN>女士  你见过这个女人吗
<5-2,RYAN>Ma'am, have you seen this woman before?

168
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:46,010
<5-3,GLADYS>我...我应该见过
<5-3,GLADYS>Well, I -- I believe I have.

169
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,670
<5-4,ESPOSITO>这里  在这幢楼里
<5-4,ESPOSITO>Here, in this building?

170
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:48,630
<5-5,GLADYS>是的
<5-5,GLADYS>Why, yes.

171
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:50,050
<5-5,GLADYS>我们在大厅里擦肩而过
<5-5,GLADYS>We passed each other in the hall.

172
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:51,410
<5-5,GLADYS>她朝亨利的公寓过去了
<5-5,GLADYS>She was headed for Henry's unit.

173
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,280
<5-6,RYAN>什么时候的事情
<5-6,RYAN>When was this?

174
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,500
<5-7,GLADYS>大概就十分钟之前
<5-7,GLADYS>Oh, about 10 minutes ago.

175
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,470
<5-8,ESPOSITO>-十分钟之前  -可能更短
<5-8,ESPOSITO>- 10 minutes ago? - Uh, maybe less.

176
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,690
<5-9,GLADYS>她和亨利被害有什么关系吗
<5-9,GLADYS>Does she have something to do with what happened to Henry?

177
00:06:58,690 --> 00:06:59,970
<5-10,RYAN>女士  亨利的公寓是多少号
<5-10,RYAN>Ma'am, what's Henry's apartment number?

178
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:01,470
<5-11,GLADYS>517
<5-11,GLADYS>Uh, 517.

179
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:19,270
<6-1,RYAN>卧室
<6-1,RYAN>Bedroom.

180
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,260
<6-3,CHIEF INSPECTOR ZHANG>把你的备枪交出来
<6-3,CHIEF INSPECTOR ZHANG>Now hand me your backup weapon.

181
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:52,900
<6-4,ESPOSITO>支援在此
<6-4,ESPOSITO>Here's his backup.

182
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:54,180
<6-4,ESPOSITO>放下枪
<6-4,ESPOSITO>Drop it.

192
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,990
<6-4,ESPOSITO>你最好想清楚了
<6-4,ESPOSITO>You better think this through.

193
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,020
<7-1,ESPOSITO>我们可是警察
<7-1,ESPOSITO>We're cops.

194
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,630
<7-2,ZHANG>我也是
<7-2,ZHANG>So am I.

195
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:19,250
<7-2,ZHANG>香港警局
<7-2,ZHANG>Hong Kong P.D.

196
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:22,180
<7-2,ZHANG>谁是这起案子的负责人
<7-2,ZHANG>Now, who's the lead investigator on this case?

197
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,300
<7-2,ZHANG>你离香港可够远的
<7-2,ZHANG>You're awfully far from Hong Kong,

198
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,720
<8-1,BECKETT>张首席调查员
<8-1,BECKETT>Chief inspector Zhang.

199
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:30,400
<8-2,ZHANG>手铐真的有必要吗
<8-2,ZHANG>Are these handcuffs truly necessary?

200
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,520
<8-3,BECKETT>你袭击了两名纽约警局的探员
<8-3,BECKETT>You attacked two NYPD detectives.

201
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,640
<8-4,ZHANG>我当时不知道他们是警察
<8-4,ZHANG>Only because I had no idea they were police.

202
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,970
<8-4,ZHANG>你是说  她把你俩的枪都夺走了
<8-4,ZHANG>So, you mean to tell me she got both your guns?

203
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:41,270
<9-1,CASTLE>你...你又不在场
<9-1,CASTLE>Hey, you -- you weren't there.

204
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:43,310
<9-2,RYAN>她动作很快
<9-2,RYAN>She's fast.

205
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:46,360
<9-2,RYAN>真的  非常快
<9-2,RYAN>I mean, like, crazy fast.

206
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:48,530
<9-3,ESPOSITO>根本没那么快
<9-3,ESPOSITO>Please. She ain't all that.

207
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,120
<9-4,CASTLE>可她还是夺走了你俩的枪
<9-4,CASTLE>And yet she got both your guns.

208
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,120
<9-4,CASTLE>这上面说你是属于
<9-4,CASTLE>It says here that you are a part of

209
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,490
<9-4,CASTLE>一个中美联合有组织犯罪调查组
<9-4,CASTLE>a U.S./Chinese organized-crime task force

210
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:59,370
<10-1,BECKETT>大本营在旧金山
<10-1,BECKETT>based in San Francisco.

211
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,150
<10-1,BECKETT>你在纽约做什么呢
<10-1,BECKETT>What are you doing in New York?

212
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:03,090
<10-2,ZHANG>探长  我们还是直奔正题吧
<10-2,ZHANG>Detective, let's cut to the chase, shall we?

213
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:04,610
<10-2,ZHANG>我不是凶手
<10-2,ZHANG>I am not the murderer.

214
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:07,440
<10-3,BECKETT>那你是不是总能找到尸体
<10-3,BECKETT>So, do you always make a habit of finding dead bodies

215
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,810
<10-3,BECKETT>然后拿走他们的随身物品
<10-3,BECKETT>and relieving them of their belongings?

216
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:09,770
<10-4,ZHANG>我认识亨利
<10-4,ZHANG>I know Henry.

217
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,680
<10-4,ZHANG>生前认识他
<10-4,ZHANG>Rather, I knew him.

218
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:12,280
<10-5,BECKETT>怎么认识的
<10-5,BECKETT>How?

219
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:14,980
<10-6,ZHANG>说起来很复杂
<10-6,ZHANG>It's complicated.

220
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:17,400
<10-7,BECKETT>他是不是和你的什么调查有关系
<10-7,BECKETT>Was he involved in one of your investigations?

221
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,540
<10-7,BECKETT>他是我的朋友
<10-7,BECKETT>He was a friend.

222
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,770
<10-8,ZHANG>我们好些年没见过了
<10-8,ZHANG>We hadn't seen each other in years.

223
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:21,770
<10-8,ZHANG>我们本来约好在纽约见面
<10-8,ZHANG>We made plans to meet here in the city,

224
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,290
<10-8,ZHANG>可他后来打电话说他来不了了
<10-8,ZHANG>and then he called me and told me he couldn't come.

225
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:25,460
<10-8,ZHANG>他听上去很害怕
<10-8,ZHANG>He sounded frightened.

226
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,560
<10-8,ZHANG>我问他发生了什么吗
<10-8,ZHANG>I asked him what was going on,

227
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,130
<10-8,ZHANG>他说他惹上麻烦了
<10-8,ZHANG>and he told me he was in trouble.

228
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:29,800
<10-9,BECKETT>-什么麻烦  -他不肯说
<10-9,BECKETT>- What kind of trouble? - He wouldn't say.

229
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:32,020
<10-10,ZHANG>我打电话给他  他一直不接
<10-10,ZHANG>I called back. He never answered.

230
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,600
<10-10,ZHANG>我很担心  就立刻飞过来了
<10-10,ZHANG>I was worried, so I flew out right away.

231
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,110
<10-11,BECKETT>那你是怎么会在犯罪现场的
<10-11,BECKETT>How did you end up at the crime scene?

232
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,160
<10-12,ZHANG>因为亨利不接我电话
<10-12,ZHANG>When Henry didn't return my calls,

233
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,410
<10-12,ZHANG>我就让旧金山的同事定位他的手机
<10-12,ZHANG>I had a colleague in San Francisco ping his cell.

234
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,030
<10-13,BECKETT>然后你就在公园找到他了
<10-13,BECKETT>So you found him in the park?

235
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,980
<10-14,ZHANG>我赶到时  他已经死了
<10-14,ZHANG>When I got there, he was already dead.

236
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,710
<10-14,ZHANG>我就拿走了他的手机和钥匙
<10-14,ZHANG>So I took his phone and his keys,

237
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:53,870
<10-14,ZHANG>自己开始了调查
<10-14,ZHANG>and I began to investigate.

238
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:55,260
<10-15,BECKETT>那你在案发现场时为什么不报警
<10-15,BECKETT>And why didn't you call us from the crime scene?

239
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,600
<10-16,ZHANG>因为我不想浪费时间
<10-16,ZHANG>'cause I didn't want to waste my time

240
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,330
<10-16,ZHANG>进行这样的谈话
<10-16,ZHANG>having this conversation.

241
00:09:58,450 --> 00:09:59,810
<10-16,ZHANG>我的朋友被谋杀了
<10-16,ZHANG>My friend has been murdered.

242
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:01,170
<10-16,ZHANG>我得找出凶手
<10-16,ZHANG>I have to find out who did it.

<12-34,ZHANG>She said he was white, 40s,

356
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,740
<12-34,ZHANG>中等身高  中等身材
<12-34,ZHANG>Average height, average weight...

357
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,760
<12-35,ZHANG>这里的无线网需要密码吗
<12-35,ZHANG>Is there a password required for Wi-Fi?

358
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,740
<12-36,MEI WU>不用  无线网是免费的
<12-36,MEI WU>No. Wi-Fi is free.

359
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,560
<12-37,BECKETT>你在想什么
<12-37,BECKETT>What are you thinking?

360
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:58,170
<12-38,ZHANG>如果那人用手机连过无线网
<12-38,ZHANG>If the man connected his phone to Wi-Fi,

361
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:00,000
<12-38,ZHANG>路由器就会记下他独一无二的MAC地址
<12-38,ZHANG>The router would have logged his unique M.A.C. address.

362
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,040
<12-38,ZHANG>我们可以用来查到他的姓名
<12-38,ZHANG>We can use that and track his name.

363
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:03,710
<12-39,BECKETT>看到没
<12-39,BECKETT>Did you see that?

364
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,530
<12-39,BECKETT>她可能凭一个无线网标志就破了这案子
<12-39,BECKETT>She might've just broken this case with a Wi-Fi sign.

365
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:09,920
<12-40,CASTLE>好吧  是很了不起  你高兴了
<12-40,CASTLE>Yes, yes, I'm impressed. Are you happy?

366
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,200
<12-41,BECKETT>不  卡塞尔
<12-41,BECKETT>No, Castle.

367
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,020
<12-41,BECKETT>她跟我很像
<12-41,BECKETT>She's just like me...

368
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,880
<12-41,BECKETT>但比我更好
<12-41,BECKETT>Only better.

369
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:19,640
<13-1,ZHANG>我查了亨利在餐馆期间
<13-1,ZHANG>So, I traced all the deviced that used the restaurant's Wi-Fi

370
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,090
<13-1,ZHANG>所有连过那里无线网的设备
<13-1,ZHANG>during the time Henry was there.

371
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:22,850
<13-1,ZHANG>只有一个设备的主人
<13-1,ZHANG>Only one is owned by a man

372
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:24,530
<13-1,ZHANG>符合嫌疑人的描述
<13-1,ZHANG>fitting our suspect's description.

373
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,110
<13-1,ZHANG>迈克尔·格拉斯曼
<13-1,ZHANG>Michael Glassman.

374
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:29,090
<13-2,CASTLE>很好  我们可以发一份给苏颖看看
<13-2,CASTLE>Good. We should send a copy of this over to Suyin.

375
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:31,420
<13-3,ZHANG>已经给了  她确定他就是
<13-3,ZHANG>I already did, and she positively identified him

376
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,150
<13-3,ZHANG>跟亨利争吵的人
<13-3,ZHANG>as the one Henry was having the argument with.

377
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:35,210
<13-4,BECKETT>格拉斯曼有犯罪记录吗
<13-4,BECKETT>Does glassman have a criminal record?

378
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,830
<13-5,ZHANG>事实上  正相反
<13-5,ZHANG>Actually, quite the opposite.

379
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:44,110
<13-6,BECKETT>等等  这没搞错吗
<13-6,BECKETT>Wait a minute. Is this right?

380
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,460
<13-7,CASTLE>怎么了  这人是谁
<13-7,CASTLE>What? Who is this guy?

381
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:49,110
<13-8,BECKETT>他是个联调局探员
<13-8,BECKETT>He's an FBI agent.

382
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,370
<14-1,BECKETT>格拉斯曼探员

<14-5,AGENT MICHAEL GLASSMAN>我们是一边的嘛  执法协作
<14-5,AGENT MICHAEL GLASSMAN>Well, we're on the same team, right? Law-enforcement synergy.

388
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:07,600
<14-5,AGENT MICHAEL GLASSMAN>纽约警方需要我帮什么忙
<14-5,AGENT MICHAEL GLASSMAN>So, what can I do for the NYPD?

389
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,430
<14-6,BECKETT>我们在调查亨利·格莱姆之死
<14-6,BECKETT>We're looking into the death of Henry Graham,

390
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:11,650
<14-6,BECKETT>希望你能为我们解答疑问
<14-6,BECKETT>and we were hoping that you could fill in the blanks.

391
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,610
<14-7,GLASSMAN>亨利·格莱姆
<14-7,GLASSMAN>Henry Graham?

392
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,110
<14-7,GLASSMAN>恐怕我没听说过这个名字
<14-7,GLASSMAN>I'm afraid that name doesn't ring a bell.

393
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,980
<14-8,CASTLE>就是这个人
<14-8,CASTLE>Uh, this man right here.

394
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,310
<14-8,CASTLE>你没见过吗
<14-8,CASTLE>You don't recognize him?

395
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:20,970
<14-9,GLASSMAN>不  没见过
<14-9,GLASSMAN>No, I don't.

396
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:26,600
<14-10,BECKETT>格拉斯曼探员  我们知道你们有过接触
<14-10,BECKETT>Agent Glassman, we know that you had contact with our victim.

397
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,470
<14-10,BECKETT>昨天在玉寺餐厅有人见过你俩
<14-10,BECKETT>You were seen with him yesterday at the Jade Temple restaurant,

398
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:33,060
<14-10,BECKETT>在一起  还在吵架
<14-10,BECKETT>together, having a heated argument.

399
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:35,170
<14-11,GLASSMAN>有人提供了假消息
<14-11,GLASSMAN>Somebody gave you a bum tip.

400
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:38,160
<14-11,GLASSMAN>我从没去过什么玉寺
<14-11,GLASSMAN>I was never at any Jade Temple.

401
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,000
<14-12,CASTLE>至少你的电话
<14-12,CASTLE>Your phone was,

402
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:42,600
<14-12,CASTLE>和一个符合你形象特征的人去过
<14-12,CASTLE>along with someone who bore a striking resemblance to you.

403
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,310
<14-13,BECKETT>几小时后  亨利就死了
<14-13,BECKETT>And then, hours later, Henry ended up dead.

404
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,600
<14-14,BECKETT>昨晚午夜左右你在哪里
<14-14,BECKETT>Where were you at midnight last night?

405
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,840
<14-15,GLASSMAN>相信我  贝克特探长  你不知道为好
<14-15,GLASSMAN>Trust me, Detective Beckett, you do not want to go there.

406
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:59,710
<15-1,BECKETT>还执法协作呢
<15-1,BECKETT>Well, so much for law-enforcement synergy.

407
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:01,920
<15-2,CASTLE>他直接就说谎说不认识亨利
<15-2,CASTLE>He out-and-out lied about knowing Henry.

408
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:04,520
<15-2,CASTLE>他和这件事绝对有关系
<15-2,CASTLE>He's in this thing up to his bolo tie.

409
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,370
<15-3,BECKETT>只是我们还不知道是什么事
<15-3,BECKETT>Only we don't know what this is.

410
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:07,420
<15-3,BECKETT>我去问问
<15-3,BECKETT>You know, I'm gonna see

411
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,440
<15-3,BECKETT>盖茨警监能不能和联调局沟通
<15-3,BECKETT>if Captain Gates can talk to the Bureau.

412
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,520
<15-3,BECKETT>也许她能问出点什么
<15-3,BECKETT>Maybe she can shake some info loose.

413
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,730
<15-3,BECKETT>你呢  有什么线索吗
<15-3,BECKETT>How about you? Do you have anything?

414
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:15,350
<15-4,RYAN>是有  但我还不确定这能证明什么
<15-4,RYAN>Uh, yeah, but I'm not quite sure what to make of it yet.

415
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:18,160
<15-4,RYAN>实验室在亨利的鞋底发现了
<15-4,RYAN>The lab found a phenol-formaldehyde resin

416
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,580
<15-4,RYAN>苯酚甲醛树脂
<15-4,RYAN>on the bottom of henry's shoes.

417
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:21,220
<15-5,BECKETT>甲醛  尸体防腐剂里那种吗
<15-5,BECKETT>Formaldehyde? Like for embalming?

418
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:24,030
<15-6,RYAN>没错  尸体防腐  电路板
<15-6,RYAN>Yeah, for embalming, making circuit boards,

419
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:26,010
<15-6,RYAN>织物处理  作用很多
<15-6,RYAN>treatment of fabrics -- all kinds of stuff.

420
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:27,250
<15-6,RYAN>他们认为他死前
<15-6,RYAN>They think that he must have

421
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,690
<15-6,RYAN>一定是去了什么用到了
<15-6,RYAN>been somewhere where that chemical was used

422
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:29,940
<15-7,CASTLE>那种化学品的地方
<15-7,CASTLE>right before he died.

423
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:31,850
<15-7,CASTLE>也许他是在偷那辆X5时
<15-7,CASTLE>Maybe he stepped in the formaldehyde

424
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,580
<15-7,CASTLE>踩到了甲醛
<15-7,CASTLE>right before he stole the X5.

425
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,810
<15-8,ESPOSITO>他没有偷X5  我查了
<15-8,ESPOSITO>He didn't jack any X5. I checked.

426
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,130
<15-8,ESPOSITO>没有X5的挂失记录
<15-8,ESPOSITO>There were no X5s reported stolen.

427
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:38,720
<15-9,CASTLE>那他要报警码是要做什么呢
<15-9,CASTLE>So what was he doing with those alarm codes?

428
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,600
<15-10,BECKETT>而且如果亨利下午两点下班
<15-10,BECKETT>And if Henry left work at 2:00 P.M.,

429
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,820
<15-10,BECKETT>午夜死亡
<15-10,BECKETT>showed up dead at midnight,

430
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,350
<15-10,BECKETT>期间就有10个未知小时
<15-10,BECKETT>he's unaccounted for for 10 hours,

431
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,280
<15-10,BECKETT>那这期间他在哪
<15-10,BECKETT>so where was he during that time?

432
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,690
<15-11,ESPOSITO>他自己没车  我去查他的
<15-11,ESPOSITO>Well, he didn't own a car, so I'll check the activity

433
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:49,750
<15-11,ESPOSITO>公交卡和信用卡  看他是不是去了哪
<15-11,ESPOSITO>on his metro and credit cards, see if he went anywhere.

434
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,580
<15-12,RYAN>我去询问他的邻居  看有没有人见过他
<15-12,RYAN>I'll circle back with his neighbors, see if they saw him.

435
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:52,960
<15-13,BECKETT>好  有线索了通知我
<15-13,BECKETT>Okay. Call me if you guys find anything.

437
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:55,070
<15-15,CASTLE>我刚刚还以为

438
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:57,680
<15-15,CASTLE>今晚就要耗在出力不讨好的乏味工作中了
<15-15,CASTLE>I was gonna get stuck doing thankless grunt work tonight.

439
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:00,730
<15-15,CASTLE>卡塞尔

<15-22,BECKETT>挺好啊  我们毕竟一起工作
<15-22,BECKETT>Yeah. I mean, we're working together.

448
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,140
<15-22,BECKETT>应该更加了解对方
<15-22,BECKETT>We should get to know each other better.

449

<15-22,BECKETT>反正  别等我了好吗
<15-22,BECKETT>Anyway, don't wait up for me, okay?

<15-25,RYAN>Let me tell you a little something about life.

453
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:32,110
<15-25,RYAN>你刚才的反应  卡塞尔  就是低级错误
<15-25,RYAN>You see, what you did there, Castle -- rookie mistake.

454
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,310
<15-26,CASTLE>我怎么了
<15-26,CASTLE>What'd I do?

00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:34,620
<15-27,RYAN>你不想让她去
<15-27,RYAN>You tried to stop her.

456
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:37,110
<15-27,RYAN>比如珍妮  她就有自己的女孩之夜
<15-27,RYAN>I mean, Jenny -- she's got her girls' nights,

457
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,680
<15-27,RYAN>而且我完全不介意
<15-27,RYAN>and I'm -- I'm totally fine with that.

458
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,070
<15-27,RYAN>在婚姻中
<15-27,RYAN>You see, in a marriage,

459
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:44,240
<15-27,RYAN>你必须要给对方留自己的空间
<15-27,RYAN>you have to give your partner some space.

460
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,330
<15-28,CASTLE>好吧  莱恩

<15-28,CASTLE>这是我第三次结婚了
<15-28,CASTLE>Uh, this is my third marriage.

462
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,880
<15-28,CASTLE>我想我知道该干什么
<15-28,CASTLE>I think I know what I'm doing.

00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:58,660
<15-28,CASTLE>理查德
<15-28,CASTLE>Rrrrrrrichard...

464
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,510
<15-29,RYAN>你为什么不想让她去
<15-29,RYAN>why don't you want her to go?

465
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:04,110
<15-30,CASTLE>两位  我们都知道张德才兼备
<15-30,CASTLE>Guys, it's no secret that Zhang is accomplished

466
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:07,330
<15-30,CASTLE>而且贝克特也很钦佩她这点
<15-30,CASTLE>and that Beckett admires her for that. E--

467
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,790
<15-30,CASTLE>甚至是嫉妒她
<15-30,CASTLE>Even envies her.

468
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:10,730
<15-30,CASTLE>所以如果她们一起出去
<15-30,CASTLE>So if they hang out,

469
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:13,280
<15-30,CASTLE>我害怕会发展成诡异的竞赛
<15-30,CASTLE>I'm just afraid it's gonna be some weird competition.

470
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:15,570
<15-31,RYAN>拜托  贝克特才不会那么做
<15-31,RYAN>Come on. Beckett would never do that.

471
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:18,140
<15-32,ESPOSITO>对呀  哥们  这可是贝克特哎
<15-32,ESPOSITO>Yeah, bro. This is Beckett we're talking about.

472
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,430
<15-32,ESPOSITO>只是个女孩之夜罢了
<15-32,ESPOSITO>It's a girls' night out.

473
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,710
<15-32,ESPOSITO>才不会发展成竞赛呢
<15-32,ESPOSITO>It won't be a competition.

474
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:30,960
<16-1,ZHANG>不错啊
<16-1,ZHANG>Not bad.

475
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:37,730
<16-2,BECKETT>谢谢  其实我有些生疏了
<16-2,BECKETT>Thanks. I'm, uh, a little rusty, though.

476
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:38,390
<16-3,ZHANG>我也是
<16-3,ZHANG>Me too.

477
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:40,210
<16-3,ZHANG>我都六个月没进射击场了
<16-3,ZHANG>I haven't been to a range in six months.

478
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,470
<16-4,BECKETT>这就是六个月没练习的结果
<16-4,BECKETT>That's after six months?

479
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:48,040
<16-5,ZHANG>很难找到时间练习
<16-5,ZHANG>It's hard to find time to practice

480
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:51,260
<16-5,ZHANG>在香港  旧金山  海牙都很忙
<16-5,ZHANG>with my duties in Hong Kong, San Fran, the Hague.

481
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,680
<16-6,BECKETT>等等  你还在海牙工作过
<16-6,BECKETT>Wait a minute. You work at the Hague?

482
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,170
<16-7,ZHANG>在国际战争罪法庭
<16-7,ZHANG>With the international war crimes tribunal.

483
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:58,590
<16-7,ZHANG>相信我  其实也没传闻的那么好
<16-7,ZHANG>Trust me, it's not as glamorous as it sounds.

484
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:00,930
<16-7,ZHANG>但当你达到了一个顶峰
<16-7,ZHANG>But when you reach the peak of a mountain,

485
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,430
<16-8,BECKETT>就会开始寻找下个目标  不是吗
<16-8,BECKETT>It's time to scale another one, right?

486
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,330
<16-8,BECKETT>是啊
<16-8,BECKETT>Yeah.

487
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:09,540
<16-8,BECKETT>你身兼队长  妻子  母亲
<16-8,BECKETT>So, uh, team leader, a wife, a mom --

488
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,600
<16-8,BECKETT>不觉得忙不过来吗
<16-8,BECKETT>isn't it a struggle to do it all?

489
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:14,530
<16-9,ZHANG>所以不要试着兼顾  而是要找到平衡点
<16-9,ZHANG>The trick is to not struggle, but to find balance.

490
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:16,640
<16-9,ZHANG>一旦你觉得吃力了
<16-9,ZHANG>The moment you think it's a struggle,

491
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,750
<16-9,ZHANG>也就是失去平衡了
<16-9,ZHANG>that's when you fall.

492
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:22,270
<16-10,BECKETT>有一件事我不明白
<16-10,BECKETT>You know, there's one thing that doesn't add up, though,

493
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:23,600
<16-10,BECKETT>以你的身份
<16-10,BECKETT>I mean, given who you are --

494
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,190
<16-11,ZHANG>你想问我为什么会认识亨利吧
<16-11,ZHANG>How Henry and I know each other --

495
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:27,090
<16-11,ZHANG>因为我们来自不同的世界
<16-11,ZHANG>Because we come from such different worlds.

496
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:27,800
<16-12,BECKETT>没错
<16-12,BECKETT>Exactly.

497
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,060
<16-13,ZHANG>我父母是联合国
<16-13,ZHANG>My parents worked as house staff

498
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,850
<16-13,ZHANG>中国代表团的住院医师
<16-13,ZHANG>for the Chinese Mission to the U.N.

499
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:32,940
<16-13,ZHANG>所以我就在这里进了所公立学校
<16-13,ZHANG>I ended up in public school, here in the city.

500
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:35,860
<16-13,ZHANG>我当时不会说英语  总因此受欺负
<16-13,ZHANG>I didn't speak much english, got bullied for it.

501
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:37,800
<16-13,ZHANG>亨利总是帮我
<16-13,ZHANG>Henry stood up for me.

502
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:40,510
<16-13,ZHANG>我无法改变他选择的路
<16-13,ZHANG>I couldn't stop what he became,

503
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:42,670
<16-13,ZHANG>但我们一直是朋友
<16-13,ZHANG>but we never stopped being friends.

504
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:47,890
<17-1,CASTLE>不知怎么  你能做到这个
<17-1,CASTLE>Somehow, the fact that you did this

505
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:49,710
<17-1,CASTLE>让我觉得你更迷人了
<17-1,CASTLE>makes you even more attractive.

506
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:50,230
<17-1,CASTLE>是吗
<17-1,CASTLE>Yeah?

507
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:52,220
<17-2,BECKETT>你这话应该对张说
<17-2,BECKETT>Well, tell it to Zhang.

508
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,380
<17-3,CASTLE>这是她的成绩吗
<17-3,CASTLE>This is her target?

509
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:56,460
<17-4,BECKETT>十多次都是这成绩
<17-4,BECKETT>And she has 10 others just like it.

510
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,020
<17-5,CASTLE>说明她枪法很准  那又怎样
<17-5,CASTLE>Well, so she's a good shot. Big deal.

511
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,850
<17-5,CASTLE>她什么都很好
<17-5,CASTLE>She's good at everything!

512
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:05,370
<17-6,BECKETT>她事业有成
<17-6,BECKETT>She's got an incredible career,

513
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:07,140
<17-6,BECKETT>老公是电影明星  有完美的孩子
<17-6,BECKETT>Movie-star husband, perfect kids.

514
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,930
<17-6,BECKETT>她什么都厉害  她什么都有
<17-6,BECKETT>She does it all, she has it all,

515
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:10,970
<17-6,BECKETT>而且最重要的是  她长得很美
<17-6,BECKETT>and to top it off, she's gorgeous.

516
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,290
<17-7,CASTLE>是啊  没错
<17-7,CASTLE>Yeah, she is.

517
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,710
<17-8,BECKETT>等等  你认为她很美吗
<17-8,BECKETT>Wait a minute. You think she's gorgeous?

518
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,620
<17-8,BECKETT>我...
<17-8,BECKETT>I...

519
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:18,800
<17-9,CASTLE>只是同意你的看法
<17-9,CASTLE>was just agreeing with you.

520
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:21,400
<17-10,BECKETT>那我说之前你认为她美吗
<17-10,BECKETT>Okay, but did you think it before I said it?

521
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:23,980
<17-11,CASTLE>不...
<17-11,CASTLE>No...?

522
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,920
<17-12,BECKETT>天呐  卡塞尔  自从长了青春痘后
<17-12,BECKETT>Oh, my god. Castle, I haven't felt like this

523
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,890
<17-12,BECKETT>我就没有这种感觉了
<17-12,BECKETT>since I had pimples.

524
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,120
<17-13,BECKETT>我没有安全感
<17-13,BECKETT>I'm insecure.

525
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:34,960
<18-1,CASTLE>你不是没有安全感
<18-1,CASTLE>You're not insecure.

526
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:36,250
<18-2,BECKETT>等等  如果我不是没有安全感
<18-2,BECKETT>Wait -- if I'm not insecure,

527
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,750
<18-2,BECKETT>那你刚才为什么要那样说
<18-2,BECKETT>then why'd you say what you just said?

528
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,110
<18-3,CASTLE>好吧  你又来了
<18-3,CASTLE>Ah -- okay, look, you're doing it again.

529
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:39,890
<18-3,CASTLE>这是帕特森综合症
<18-3,CASTLE>It's patterson syndrome.

530
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:41,740
<18-3,CASTLE>我就知道你跟她出去是个坏主意
<18-3,CASTLE>I knew it was a bad idea for you to go out with her.

531
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:45,360
<18-4,BECKETT>不  卡塞尔  我只想知道什么是张的动力
<18-4,BECKETT>No, no. Castle, I just wanted to see what made Zhang tick --

532
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,650
<18-4,BECKETT>她是怎么得到今天拥有的一切
<18-4,BECKETT>you know, how she achieved what she did,

533
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:48,370
<18-4,BECKETT>这样也许可以帮助我提高自己
<18-4,BECKETT>so maybe that could help me move forward.

534
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:51,320
<18-5,CASTLE>凯特  你不需要她的帮助  你已经很好了
<18-5,CASTLE>Kate, you don't need her help. You're doing just fine.

535
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,210
<18-6,BECKETT>是的  但是当你到达一座山的顶峰时
<18-6,BECKETT>Yeah, but when you reach the peak of one mountain,

536
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:55,120
<18-6,BECKETT>难道不该翻越另一座山吗
<18-6,BECKETT>isn't it time to scale another one?

537
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:57,040
<18-7,CASTLE>那听起来像是张会说的话
<18-7,CASTLE>That sounds like something Zhang would say.

538
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:57,950
<18-7,CASTLE>你在引用她的话吗
<18-7,CASTLE>Are you quoting her?

539
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,000
<18-8,BECKETT>没有
<18-8,BECKETT>No.

540
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,730
<18-9,CASTLE>你把张想得太完美了
<18-9,CASTLE>Look, you're idealizing Zhang.

541
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:03,030
<18-9,CASTLE>你把自己跟一个
<18-9,CASTLE>You're comparing yourself

542
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,120
<18-9,CASTLE>根本不存在的她相比较
<18-9,CASTLE>to a version of her that doesn't even exist.

543
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,320
<18-9,CASTLE>她是个凡人  跟我们一样  也有缺点
<18-9,CASTLE>She is a human, like the rest of us, flaws and all,

544
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:09,760
<18-9,CASTLE>她并不是每次都会跳出来
<18-9,CASTLE>not some infallible supercop

545
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,430
<18-9,CASTLE>拯救世界的完美超级警察
<18-9,CASTLE>who swoops in every time to save the day.

546
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,080
<18-10,RYAN>张刚找到可能会破案的线索
<18-10,RYAN>Hey. Zhang just got a lead that could crack this case.

547
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:17,830
<18-11,BECKETT>你刚才说什么来着
<18-11,BECKETT>You were saying?

548
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,900
<19-1,ZHANG>我刚才在看亨利公寓大楼的
<19-1,ZHANG>I was scanning surveillance video

549
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,180
<19-1,ZHANG>监控录像
<19-1,ZHANG>of Henry's apartment complex,

550
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:26,360
<19-1,ZHANG>试图拼凑起他死那天的时间线
<19-1,ZHANG>trying to piece together the timeline on the day he died,

551
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,370
<19-1,ZHANG>然后我看到了这个
<19-1,ZHANG>when I saw this.

552
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,410
<19-1,ZHANG>那是亨利
<19-1,ZHANG>That's Henry.

553
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:31,790
<19-2,ZHANG>看时间  下午两点三十七分
<19-2,ZHANG>Note the time -- 2:37 P.M.

554
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:34,720
<19-3,BECKETT>就是说亨利离开回收场后  回了趟家
<19-3,BECKETT>Meaning after Henry left the repo yard, he went back home.

555
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,080
<19-4,ZHANG>不过他没有久留
<19-4,ZHANG>Except he didn't stay.

556
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:38,870
<19-4,ZHANG>五分钟后  他就离开了公寓大楼
<19-4,ZHANG>Five minutes later, he left his apartment complex.

557
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:40,940
<19-4,ZHANG>看接下来发生了什么
<19-4,ZHANG>Watch what happens next.

558
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,540
<19-5,CASTLE>在亨利·格莱姆死前  他被绑架了
<19-5,CASTLE>Before he was killed, Henry Graham was kidnapped.

559
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:57,850
<20-1,ESPOSITO>技术部门放大照片看清了车牌
<20-1,ESPOSITO>Tech was able to pull the numbers off the license plate.

560
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:01,230
<20-1,ESPOSITO>这辆越野车登记在"比利"威廉·希克斯名下
<20-1,ESPOSITO>The S.U.V. is registered to a William "Billy" Hicks.

561
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:03,950
<20-2,RYAN>据我在缉毒队的兄弟说  这个人是狠角色
<20-2,RYAN>According to my buddies at narcotics, this guy's hard-core.

562
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:06,620
<20-2,RYAN>每年  他都会登上他们毒贩前二十的榜单
<20-2,RYAN>Every year, he makes their "Top 20" list for drug dealers.

563
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,690
<20-2,RYAN>但他们一直都没能抓住他...
<20-2,RYAN>But they've never been able to nail him --

564
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:11,050
<20-2,RYAN>主要因为他总让别人来做那些非法的事
<20-2,RYAN>Mostly because he has other guys do his dirty work.

565
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,340
<20-3,ZHANG>我知道这个人
<20-3,ZHANG>I know this man.

566
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,660
<20-3,ZHANG>"比利"希克斯让亨利走上了犯罪之路
<20-3,ZHANG>Billy Hicks started Henry on a life of crime,

567
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,210
<20-3,ZHANG>他雇佣他做打手
<20-3,ZHANG>hired him as an enforcer.

568
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:18,110
<20-3,ZHANG>亨利就是因为他才进的监狱
<20-3,ZHANG>He's the reason that Henry went to prison.

569
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:20,550
<20-4,CASTLE>也许亨利也是因此才被杀的
<20-4,CASTLE>Well, then he's probably the reason Henry was murdered.

570
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,910
<20-5,ZHANG>但亨利不为希克斯工作  已有近十年
<20-5,ZHANG>But Henry hasn't worked for Hicks in -- in almost 10 years.

571
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:25,560
<20-5,ZHANG>为什么希克斯现在会找上他
<20-5,ZHANG>Why would Hicks come after him now?

572
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,350
<20-6,BECKETT>也许亨利知道的太多
<20-6,BECKETT>Maybe Henry knew too much --

573
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:30,910
<20-6,BECKETT>希克斯和贩毒组织的事
<20-6,BECKETT>about Hicks and the organization.

574
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:34,040
<20-6,BECKETT>这正是格拉斯曼在玉寺接近他的原因
<20-6,BECKETT>That's probably why Glassman approached him at the Jade Temple --

575
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,610
<20-6,BECKETT>联调局在立案调查希克斯
<20-6,BECKETT>The FBI is building a case against Hicks.

576
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:38,780
<20-7,CASTLE>格拉斯曼希望亨利揭发他的罪行
<20-7,CASTLE>And Glassman wanted Henry to roll.

577
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:40,250
<20-8,BECKETT>如果亨利拒绝的话
<20-8,BECKETT>You know, if Henry refused,

578
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:42,190
<20-8,BECKETT>那就解释了格拉斯曼为什么和他争吵
<20-8,BECKETT>that explains why Glassman and he fought.

579
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:43,670
<20-9,ZHANG>他是否拒绝并不重要
<20-9,ZHANG>It doesn't matter if he refused.

580
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,270
<20-9,ZHANG>像希克斯那样的人  如果认为亨利跟联调局交涉
<20-9,ZHANG>If a man like Hicks thought Henry was talking to the FBI,

581
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:48,500
<20-9,ZHANG>他会不择手段保护自己的帝国
<20-9,ZHANG>he would stop at nothing to protect his empire

582
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,170
<20-9,ZHANG>铲除威胁
<20-9,ZHANG>and eliminate the threat.

583
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,170
<20-10,BECKETT>在哪能找到希克斯
<20-10,BECKETT>Where do we find Hicks?

584
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:53,940
<20-11,ESPOSITO>他在皇后区经营了一家健身房
<20-11,ESPOSITO>He operates out of a gym he owns in Queens --

585
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:54,920
<20-11,ESPOSITO>奥唐纳拳击馆
<20-11,ESPOSITO>O'donnell's boxing.

586
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,900
<20-12,BECKETT>好的  我们走
<20-12,BECKETT>All right. Let's go.

587
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:57,130
<20-13,GATES>探长  等一下
<20-13,GATES>Detective, wait!

588
00:23:58,010 --> 00:23:59,210
<20-13,GATES>我有话要跟你说
<20-13,GATES>I need a word with you.

589
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:07,170
<21-1,GATES>你不能追希克斯这条线
<21-1,GATES>You can't go after Hicks.

590
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:09,320
<21-2,BECKETT>为什么不行
<21-2,BECKETT>W-why not?

591
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,720
<21-3,GATES>总局直接下达的命令
<21-3,GATES>Orders straight from 1PP.

592
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:13,810
<21-4,BECKETT>他们有说原因吗
<21-4,BECKETT>Did they say why?

593
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:15,620
<21-5,GATES>只说那是联邦政府事宜
<21-5,GATES>Just that it's a Federal matter.

594
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:20,690
<21-6,BECKETT>我说对了  联调局在调查希克斯
<21-6,BECKETT>So I'm right -- Hicks is being investigated by the Feds.

595
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,840
<21-7,GATES>他们不希望我们搞砸他们的案子
<21-7,GATES>And they don't want us screwing up their case.

596
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:25,440
<21-8,BECKETT>长官  他可能是这案的凶手
<21-8,BECKETT>Sir, he could be our killer.

597
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,490
<21-9,GATES>他们知晓这一点  他们让我们等
<21-9,GATES>They are aware of that. They need us to wait.

598
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:28,290
<21-10,BECKETT>等多久
<21-10,BECKETT>For how long?

599
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,900
<21-11,GATES>等到可以落案起诉他
<21-11,GATES>Until indictments come down.

600
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:32,960
<22-1,ZHANG>到底什么时候可以起诉他
<22-1,ZHANG>And when exactly do they expect these indictments --

601
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,220
<22-1,ZHANG>几天  几周  还是几个月
<22-1,ZHANG>Days, weeks, months?

602
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:35,890
<22-2,BECKETT>我们不知道  但在那之前
<22-2,BECKETT>We don't know, but until then,

603
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:38,540
<22-2,BECKETT>上面下令让我们暂停对他的调查
<22-2,BECKETT>we've been ordered to stand down from this investigation.

604
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,440
<22-2,BECKETT>你是说...
<22-2,BECKETT>What are you saying --

605
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:41,640
<22-3,ZHANG>我的朋友死了  而我却什么也不能为他做吗
<22-3,ZHANG>that my friend is dead and I can do nothing?

606
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,770
<22-3,ZHANG>你是这个意思吗  贝克特探长
<22-3,ZHANG>Is that what you're telling me, Detective Beckett?

607
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:46,760
<22-3,ZHANG>公理何在
<22-3,ZHANG>Where is the justice in that?

608
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,210
<22-4,BECKETT>她说得没错
<22-4,BECKETT>She's not wrong.

609
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,210
<22-5,CASTLE>尽管我们不能接近希克斯
<22-5,CASTLE>Look, even though we can't approach Hicks,

610
00:24:57,210 --> 00:25:00,110
<22-5,CASTLE>我们仍可以立案  收集他的罪证
<22-5,CASTLE>we can build a case, gather evidence against him.

611
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:01,740
<22-6,RYAN>我们就从街头监控开始寻找
<22-6,RYAN>We'll start by combing street cams --

612
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,240
<22-6,RYAN>看是否能找到越野车
<22-6,RYAN>see if we can find out where that S.U.V.

613
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,370
<22-6,RYAN>带走亨利后去了哪里
<22-6,RYAN>went after Henry was taken.

614
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,660
<22-7,ESPOSITO>我会派一队人去犯罪现场询问一下公园里的人
<22-7,ESPOSITO>I'll send a team to the crime scene to canvass the park,

615
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,450
<22-7,ESPOSITO>看是否有人记得曾看见过那辆越野车
<22-7,ESPOSITO>see if anyone remembers seeing that S.U.V.

616
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:09,680
<22-8,BECKETT>我们应该找张谈谈
<22-8,BECKETT>You know, we should talk to Zhang,

617
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,770
<22-8,BECKETT>看她还知道亨利和希克斯一些什么事
<22-8,BECKETT>see what else she knows about Henry and Hicks.

618
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,560
<22-9,BECKETT>张
<22-9,BECKETT>Zhang?

619
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:29,210
<22-10,BECKETT>伙计们  张从这里出去的吗
<22-10,BECKETT>You guys, did Zhang circle back through here?

620
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:31,070
<22-11,ESPOSITO>-没有  她从那条路走的  对吗  -是的
<22-11,ESPOSITO>- No. She stormed off that way, didn't she? - Yeah.

621
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:32,430
<22-13,CASTLE>你不会认为...
<22-13,CASTLE>Oh. You don't think --

622
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:34,510
<22-14,BECKETT>是的  没错  她去奥唐纳拳击馆了
<22-14,BECKETT>Yeah, I do -- O'donnell's boxing gym.

623
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:35,450
<22-15,RYAN>她去找希克斯了
<22-15,RYAN>She's going after Hicks.

624
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,510
<22-16,BECKETT>我去找她
<22-16,BECKETT>I-I'll get her.

625
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:38,600
<22-16,BECKETT>我应该对她负责
<22-16,BECKETT>She's my responsibility.

627
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:15,130
<23-1,TONY>如果你要找普拉提健身馆的话
<23-1,TONY>If you're looking for the Pilates studio,

628
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:16,060
<23-1,TONY>去街对面
<23-1,TONY>it's across the street.

629
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:18,070
<23-2,ZHANG>我要找你老板  在那  希克斯
<23-2,ZHANG>I'm looking for your boss. There -- Hicks.

<23-3,BILLY HICKS>让开  托尼
<23-3,BILLY HICKS>Step aside, Tony.

631
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:21,000
<23-3,BILLY HICKS>别让女士这么不自在
<23-3,BILLY HICKS>Make a lady feel welcome here.

632
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:24,330
<23-3,BILLY HICKS>尤其是...
<23-3,BILLY HICKS>Especially someone as...

633
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,470
<23-3,BILLY HICKS>像花朵一样精致的女士
<23-3,BILLY HICKS>as lovely as this delicate flower.

634
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:29,880
<23-4,HICKS>有什么可以效劳的  怎么称呼
<23-4,HICKS>What could I do you for, Miss...?

<23-4,HICKS>张
<23-4,HICKS>Zhang.

636
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:33,020
<23-5,ZHANG>我想跟你谈一个我们共同的朋友
<23-5,ZHANG>I'd like to discuss a mutual friend --

637
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:34,200
<23-5,ZHANG>亨利·格莱姆
<23-5,ZHANG>Henry Graham.

638
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:37,770
<23-6,HICKS>抱歉  我没听过这个名字
<23-6,HICKS>Sorry. I don't know that name.

639
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:38,910
<23-7,ZHANG>我可不这么认为
<23-7,ZHANG>Oh, I think you do.

640
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:42,530
<23-8,HICKS>你不会想这么做的
<23-8,HICKS>You don't want to do that.

641
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:43,630
<23-8,HICKS>你会受伤
<23-8,HICKS>You might get hurt.

642
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:46,040
<23-9,ZHANG>真是好笑  我刚好也想这么对他说来着
<23-9,ZHANG>Funny. I was gonna say the same thing to him.

643
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:54,810
<23-10,HICKS>亲爱的  你不该这么做
<23-10,HICKS>Wrong move, sweetheart.

00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:31,840
<24-2,HICKS>救命
<24-2,HICKS>Help me!

645

00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:37,980
<24-3,BECKETT>张  后退
<24-3,BECKETT>Zhang, step away!

647
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,050
<24-4,ZHANG>别管我们  探长
<24-4,ZHANG>Leave us, detective!

648
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:40,630
<24-5,BECKETT>别让我再说一次
<24-5,BECKETT>Don't make me ask again.

649
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:54,020
<24-6,HICKS>别以为这就完了  我要告你
<24-6,HICKS>Say goodbye, sister, 'cause I am pressing charges!

650
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,640
<24-6,HICKS>把这个疯婊子抓起来
<24-6,HICKS>Now arrest this crazy bitch.

651
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,840
<24-7,BECKETT>也得先让我把你抓起来再说
<24-7,BECKETT>Right after I arrest you.

652
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:57,520
<24-8,HICKS>凭什么
<24-8,HICKS>For what?

653
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,080
<24-9,BECKETT>我们有你在亨利·格莱姆的公寓门口
<24-9,BECKETT>We have a video of you abducting Henry Graham

654
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,760
<24-9,BECKETT>绑架他的监控录像
<24-9,BECKETT>outside of his apartment.

655
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:02,960
<24-10,HICKS>绑架
<24-10,HICKS>Abduct?

656
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,020
<24-10,HICKS>我们只是送他一程
<24-10,HICKS>We gave him a ride.

657
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,680
<24-11,ZHANG>通过把他绑上车吗
<24-11,ZHANG>By forcing him into your S.U.V.?

658
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,010
<24-12,HICKS>拜托  那只是个恶作剧
<24-12,HICKS>Come on, that was a gag.

659
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:09,830
<24-12,HICKS>我的手下只是在捉弄他
<24-12,HICKS>Okay, my boys were just... messing with him.

660
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:11,480
<24-12,HICKS>我们经常这么做  你去问亨利
<24-12,HICKS>We do that stuff all the time. Ask Henry.

661
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,980
<24-13,ZHANG>那会很困难  因为他被你杀了
<24-13,ZHANG>That's gonna be hard, seeing as you killed him.

662
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,750
<24-13,ZHANG>等等
<24-13,ZHANG>Wait.

663
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,390
<24-14,HICKS>亨利死了吗
<24-14,HICKS>Henry's dead?

664
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:22,120
<24-14,HICKS>我完全与那无关
<24-14,HICKS>Okay, I had nothing to do with that.

665
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:23,870
<24-14,HICKS>我只是在帮他
<24-14,HICKS>All I did was help him.

666
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:24,840
<24-15,BECKETT>帮他做什么
<24-15,BECKETT>Help him with what?

667
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:28,480
<24-16,BECKETT>你不想对我说吗
<24-16,BECKETT>You don't want to talk to me?

668
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:29,930
<24-16,BECKETT>可以  那你跟她说去
<24-16,BECKETT>Fine. You can talk to her.

669
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,360
<24-17,HICKS>好吧  听着
<24-17,HICKS>Okay, look.

670
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:36,040
<24-17,HICKS>他上周来找我帮忙
<24-17,HICKS>He came to me last week needing a favor.

671
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:37,540
<24-18,BECKETT>帮什么忙
<24-18,BECKETT>What kind of a favor?

672
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:40,480
<24-19,HICKS>这么说吧  他想要点东西
<24-19,HICKS>Let's just say he wanted something.

673
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,080
<24-20,BECKETT>他想要什么
<24-20,BECKETT>What did he want?!

674
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:44,500
<24-21,HICKS>可以假设地说吗
<24-21,HICKS>Hypothetically?

675
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,920
<24-22,BECKETT>可以  那就假设
<24-22,BECKETT>Yeah. Fine. Hypothetically.

676
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,180
<24-23,HICKS>这么说  只是举个例子
<24-23,HICKS>Let's say -- and this is just an example --

677
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,870
<24-23,HICKS>他想要500克可卡因
<24-23,HICKS>That he wanted half a kilo of coke.

678
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:55,250
<24-24,ZHANG>他要可卡因做什么
<24-24,ZHANG>Why would Henry need cocaine?

679
00:28:57,030 --> 00:29:00,470
<24-25,HICKS>我们假设  在这个例子里
<24-25,HICKS>Let's just assume, in this particular example,

680
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:02,270
<24-25,HICKS>他说他想帮一个朋友
<24-25,HICKS>that he said he was trying to help a friend

681
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:03,770
<24-25,HICKS>脱离困境
<24-25,HICKS>get out of a bad situation.

682
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:04,900
<24-26,BECKETT>那个朋友是谁
<24-26,BECKETT>Who was the friend,

683
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,630
<24-26,BECKETT>还有他们要可卡因做什么
<24-26,BECKETT>and what were they gonna do with the coke?

684
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:08,280
<24-27,HICKS>也许他没有说  我也没有问
<24-27,HICKS>Maybe he didn't say, and I didn't ask.

685
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:10,120
<24-27,HICKS>也许我告诉过他他不该再掺和进来
<24-27,HICKS>Maybe I told him he shouldn't get back in the game.

686
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,170
<24-27,HICKS>太危险了
<24-27,HICKS>It's too dangerous.

687
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,190
<24-27,HICKS>但他说这只是一次性的交易
<24-27,HICKS>But he said it was just a one-time deal.

688
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:14,390
<24-28,ZHANG>你在说谎
<24-28,ZHANG>You're lying!

689
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:15,750
<24-28,ZHANG>-亨利绝不会贩毒  -等等  张
<24-28,ZHANG>- Henry would never sell drugs! - Wait! Zhang! Zhang!

690
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:17,290
<24-30,HICKS>也许我们说的不是同一个亨利
<24-30,HICKS>Maybe we're talking about different Henrys,

691
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:18,890
<24-30,HICKS>因为我这个例子里说的亨利
<24-30,HICKS>because the one in my example

692
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:20,930
<24-30,HICKS>让我把那些可卡因分成小的定量
<24-30,HICKS>asked for it to be divided into smaller eight-balls.

693
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:26,290
<24-31,HICKS>探长  亨利以前在我手下干得很好
<24-31,HICKS>Look, detective, Henry served me well back in the day.

694
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:28,340
<24-31,HICKS>当货准备好之后
<24-31,HICKS>When the shipment was ready,

695
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,730
<24-31,HICKS>我是去接他  而不是绑架
<24-31,HICKS>I had him picked up, not abducted.

696
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:33,170
<24-31,HICKS>我把他需要的可卡因给了他
<24-31,HICKS>I gave him the coke he needed.

697
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:34,000
<24-31,HICKS>他很感激
<24-31,HICKS>He was so grateful,

698
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,610
<24-31,HICKS>他甚至告诉我联调局的人在监视我的地盘
<24-31,HICKS>he even told me about the Feds watching my place,

699
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:38,730
<24-31,HICKS>他们上周看到他离开这里
<24-31,HICKS>how they saw him leave here last week,

700
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:40,630
<24-31,HICKS>想通过他举报我
<24-31,HICKS>and they tried to get him to roll on me.

701
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:44,780
<24-31,HICKS>当然  这都是假设
<24-31,HICKS>Hypothetically, of course.

702
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:48,500
<24-32,HICKS>那是我最后一次有他的消息
<24-32,HICKS>And that was the last I've heard of him.

703
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:50,590
<24-33,BECKETT>假设你说的都是实话
<24-33,BECKETT>Let's just say that you're telling the truth.

704
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:53,670
<24-33,BECKETT>他有没有告诉你拿了毒品后要去哪
<24-33,BECKETT>Did he tell you where he was going with the drugs?

705
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,490
<24-33,BECKETT>没有
<24-33,BECKETT>No.

706
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:56,390
<24-34,HICKS>但我的手下送他回城时
<24-34,HICKS>But when my boys took him back to the city,

707
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:57,760
<24-34,HICKS>他没有回家
<24-34,HICKS>he didn't go home.

708
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,940
<24-34,HICKS>他想去53大道和第一大道的路口
<24-34,HICKS>He wanted out on 53rd and 1st.

709
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:06,070
<25-1,BECKETT>莱恩  希克斯有可能没说实话
<25-1,BECKETT>Yeah, Ryan. Look, Hicks could be lying about everything.

710
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,230
<25-1,BECKETT>我们还是得派侦察队
<25-1,BECKETT>We still got to send a patrol

711
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:09,700
<25-1,BECKETT>排查53大道和第一大道附近  以防万一
<25-1,BECKETT>to canvass 53rd and 1st, just in case.

712
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:12,520
<25-1,BECKETT>寻找目击证人  谢谢
<25-1,BECKETT>Yeah. Look for witnesses. Thanks.

713
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:15,090
<25-2,ZHANG>他们还得调出那个区域的交通监控
<25-2,ZHANG>They should also pull traffic-camera footage of the area.

714
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:17,460
<25-3,BECKETT>你没资格再发号施令了
<25-3,BECKETT>That is not your call -- not anymore.

715
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:19,220
<25-3,BECKETT>你在想些什么
<25-3,BECKETT>What the hell were you thinking?

716
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,580
<25-4,ZHANG>我做了我该做的
<25-4,ZHANG>I did what I had to!

717
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:24,190
<25-5,BECKETT>一点都不考虑联邦调查局  纽约警局以及我
<25-5,BECKETT>Without any regard for the Feds, for the NYPD, for me.

718
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:26,900
<25-5,BECKETT>这就是你说的平衡吗
<25-5,BECKETT>Is that what you call being balanced?

719
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:30,060
<25-6,ZHANG>你想知道什么叫平衡吗
<25-6,ZHANG>Okay, you want to know about being balanced?

720
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:32,560
<25-6,ZHANG>我丈夫和我分居了
<25-6,ZHANG>My husband and I are separated!

721
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,540
<25-6,ZHANG>我也没尽到母亲的责任
<25-6,ZHANG>I am not the mother I should be!

722
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:37,810
<25-6,ZHANG>你觉得我是了不起的警察  我什么都有
<25-6,ZHANG>You think I'm this amazing cop, that I have it all together,

723
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:38,940
<25-6,ZHANG>可实际上我不是那样
<25-6,ZHANG>but I don't!

724
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:41,970
<25-7,BECKETT>亨利的死是我造成的
<25-7,BECKETT>I'm the reason that Henry's dead!

725
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:45,170
<25-7,BECKETT>你在说什么
<25-7,BECKETT>What -- what are you talking about?

726
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:46,540
<25-8,ZHANG>前几周他给我打了电话
<25-8,ZHANG>He called the other week.

727
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,200
<25-8,ZHANG>他留了一条信息
<25-8,ZHANG>He left a message saying that...

728
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,530
<25-8,ZHANG>说他需要我的帮助
<25-8,ZHANG>...he needed my help.

729
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,410
<25-8,ZHANG>我觉得那不是很重要
<25-8,ZHANG>I didn't think it was important,

730
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:54,810
<25-8,ZHANG>所以没有马上回电话
<25-8,ZHANG>so I didn't call him back right away,

731
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:56,210
<25-8,ZHANG>当我给他打电话时  已经晚了
<25-8,ZHANG>and when I did, it was too late.

732
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,970
<25-8,ZHANG>他说没有人可以帮他了
<25-8,ZHANG>He told me no one could help him anymore.

733
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,120
<25-9,BECKETT>所以你才会搭上那架飞机
<25-9,BECKETT>That's why you hopped on that plane?

734
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:04,120
<25-10,ZHANG>从小到大  亨利总是为我着想  帮助我
<25-10,ZHANG>Growing up, Henry was always there for me,

735
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,350
<25-10,ZHANG>保护我
<25-10,ZHANG>protecting me.

736
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,520
<25-10,ZHANG>可当他需要我时  我却忙不过来
<25-10,ZHANG>And when he needed me, I was too busy.

737
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:11,400
<25-10,ZHANG>我总是忙得没时间
<25-10,ZHANG>I am always too busy

738
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,390
<25-10,ZHANG>去做那些真正重要的事情
<25-10,ZHANG>for everything that really matters.

739
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,030
<25-10,ZHANG>所以我必须这么做
<25-10,ZHANG>That's why I need to do this

740
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:18,710
<25-10,ZHANG>不仅为亨利也为我自己
<25-10,ZHANG>not just for Henry, for me.

742
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,050
<25-11,ZHANG>谁打来的
<25-11,ZHANG>Who is it?

743
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:36,350
<26-1,ZHANG>都是我的错
<26-1,ZHANG>This is all my fault.

744
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,460
<26-2,CASTLE>当然是你的错
<26-2,CASTLE>It sure is.

745
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,150
<26-3,ZHANG>我要进去  她不该为此承担过错
<26-3,ZHANG>I'm going in. She shouldn't take the blame for it.

746
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:42,930
<26-4,CASTLE>如果她不想承担  她是不会这么做的
<26-4,CASTLE>She wouldn't take it if she didn't want to.

747
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:45,700
<26-4,CASTLE>相信我  贝克特在承担
<26-4,CASTLE>Believe me, Beckett has plenty of experience

748
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:48,400
<26-4,CASTLE>别人干的蠢事这方面颇有经验
<26-4,CASTLE>taking a bullet for other people doing stupid things.

749
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,600
<26-4,CASTLE>她和我结婚了
<26-4,CASTLE>Hell, she's married to me.

750
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:53,810
<26-4,CASTLE>但你们这些超级警察得聚团  对吗
<26-4,CASTLE>But, uh, you supercops need to stick together, right?

751
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,120
<26-5,ZHANG>怎么了
<26-5,ZHANG>What happened?

752
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,980
<26-6,BECKETT>我告诉她你离开时
<26-6,BECKETT>Uh, I told her that you left

753
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,900
<26-6,BECKETT>并不知道希克斯在我们的调查范围之外
<26-6,BECKETT>before you knew Hicks was off-limits.

754
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:02,990
<26-7,ZHANG>她相信你吗
<26-7,ZHANG>Did she believe you?

755
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,370
<26-8,BECKETT>她选择相信我
<26-8,BECKETT>She chose to believe me.

756
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:08,480
<26-9,ZHANG>谢谢你  探长
<26-9,ZHANG>Thank you, detective.

<26-11,RYAN>Hey. So, we got a hit off that canvass.

00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,700
<26-11,RYAN>附近徘徊

764
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,380
<26-11,RYAN>鉴于亨利是回收人
<26-11,RYAN>Seeing that Henry was a repo man.

00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,780
<26-12,ESPOSITO>我们联系了楼管

768
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,140
<26-14,CASTLE>亨利要找的就是它的报警码
<26-14,CASTLE>Those alarm codes that Henry requested.

<26-15,BECKETT>车是谁的
<26-15,BECKETT>Who owns the car?

770
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,660
<26-16,RYAN>这位  杰弗瑞·沃德罗
<26-16,RYAN>This guy -- Jeffrey Wadlow.

771
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:37,530
<26-16,RYAN>是个富有的房产开发商

776
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:47,580
<26-18,RYAN>沃德罗在贩毒  他们让他靠边停车

779
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,830
<26-19,ZHANG>那就是说亨利没有在贩毒
<26-19,ZHANG>That means Henry wasn't selling drugs.

780
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,990
<26-19,ZHANG>而是嫁祸给别人
<26-19,ZHANG>He was planting them.

791
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,600
<27-3,ZHANG>如果你说不认识亨利
<27-3,ZHANG>And it's going to be worse for you

792
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,580
<27-3,ZHANG>但我们查出你认识他  你就惨了
<27-3,ZHANG>if you say you don't know Henry and we find out you do.

793
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,260
<27-4,WADLOW>但我不认识他
<27-4,WADLOW>But I don't know him.

794
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:21,200
<27-5,BECKETT>那他为什么要把毒品放到你车里
<27-5,BECKETT>So why would he plant drugs in your car?

795
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:22,870
<27-5,BECKETT>太好了

00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:25,460
<27-6,WADLOW>我跟警察说了有人陷害我
<27-6,WADLOW>I told the cops they were planted.

797
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:27,530
<27-6,WADLOW>终于有人信了
<27-6,WADLOW>Finally, someone who believes me!

798
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:30,000
<27-6,WADLOW>慢着  你们既然知道是他做的
<27-6,WADLOW>Hey, hey, if you know it was this guy,

<27-6,WADLOW>那我不就可以出去了吗
<27-6,WADLOW>then I can get out of here, right?

800
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:33,340
<27-7,ZHANG>可你买凶谋杀亨利
<27-7,ZHANG>Not when you reached out and hired someone

801
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,860
<27-7,ZHANG>这帐还没算
<27-7,ZHANG>to murder Henry.

802
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:35,980
<27-7,ZHANG>谋杀
<27-7,ZHANG>Murder?!

803
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:38,640
<27-8,WADLOW>我从来没杀过人
<27-8,WADLOW>I-I would never have someone killed,

804
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,920
<27-8,WADLOW>更何况是素昧平生的人
<27-8,WADLOW>I-I -- especially someone I've never even seen before.

805
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,070
<27-9,ZHANG>如果你不认识亨利
<27-9,ZHANG>If you don't know Henry,

806
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:43,390
<27-9,ZHANG>那他为什么要陷害你
<27-9,ZHANG>then why would he try to frame you?

807
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:44,510
<27-10,WADLOW>我怎么知道
<27-10,WADLOW>I have no idea.

808
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,490
<27-10,WADLOW>可能是有人教唆他这么做的
<27-10,WADLOW>Maybe somebody put him up to it.

809
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:48,190
<27-11,BECKETT>-比如谁  -我不知道
<27-11,BECKETT>- Like who? - I don't know.

810
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:49,990
<27-12,WADLOW>或许是有人
<27-12,WADLOW>Maybe somebody who --

811
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,700
<27-12,WADLOW>看不惯我做生意的方式
<27-12,WADLOW>somebody who doesn't like the way I do business --

812
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,980
<27-12,WADLOW>竞争对手  可能
<27-12,WADLOW>A competitor, maybe.

813
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:57,250
<27-13,BECKETT>沃德罗先生  如果你入狱  谁最获利呢
<27-13,BECKETT>Who stands to gain by you going to prison, Mr. Wadlow?

814
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,480
<27-14,WADLOW>好多好多人
<27-14,WADLOW>A whole lot of people.

815
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:05,630
<28-1,BECKETT>沃德罗的谋杀嫌疑洗清了
<28-1,BECKETT>Wadlow's in the clear for the murder.

816
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:07,390
<28-1,BECKETT>亨利死亡时他正被关押着
<28-1,BECKETT>He was locked up at the time of the death.

817
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:09,790
<28-2,ZHANG>他会不会在拘留期间买凶呢
<28-2,ZHANG>Could he have ordered Henry's execution while detained?

818
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,270
<28-3,BECKETT>他打了一通电话  给他的律师
<28-3,BECKETT>Uh, he made one phone call -- to his lawyer.

819
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:13,430
<28-3,BECKETT>在亨利死之前
<28-3,BECKETT>And he didn't manage to get through

820
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:14,950
<28-3,BECKETT>电话一直没接通
<28-3,BECKETT>until Henry was already dead.

821
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:16,690
<28-4,ESPOSITO>贝克特  我们梳理了
<28-4,ESPOSITO>Yo, Beckett, we were combing through

822
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:18,550
<28-4,ESPOSITO>沃德罗的业务往来  发现了一些
<28-4,ESPOSITO>Wadlow's business dealings, and we came across something

823
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:19,670
<28-4,ESPOSITO>可能和案件有关的信息
<28-4,ESPOSITO>that might be connected to our case.

824
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:21,100
<28-5,RYAN>过去的半年里
<28-5,RYAN>Over the past six months,

825
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,050
<28-5,RYAN>沃德罗一直在购入不动产
<28-5,RYAN>Wadlow's been buying up real estate

826
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:25,490
<28-5,RYAN>以便他在唐人街进一步开发
<28-5,RYAN>for his next new development in Chinatown,

827
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:27,430
<28-5,RYAN>每次他出价
<28-5,RYAN>and each time he did,

828
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:29,260
<28-5,RYAN>都能高于同类对手公司
<28-5,RYAN>he outbid the same rival company.

829
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:32,140
<28-6,ESPOSITO>VCN控股公司  然而VCN的女老板
<28-6,ESPOSITO>VCN holdings -- and the woman who runs VCN

830
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:33,860
<28-6,ESPOSITO>正好拥有一家小餐厅
<28-6,ESPOSITO>also happens to own a little restaurant

831
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:35,540
<28-6,ESPOSITO>玉寺
<28-6,ESPOSITO>called the Jade Temple.

832
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,880
<28-7,CASTLE>谭咪咪是幕后主使
<28-7,CASTLE>Mimi Tan is behind this?

833
00:34:36,890 --> 00:34:39,280
<28-8,ESPOSITO>对  餐厅是她那些生意中的一个
<28-8,ESPOSITO>That's right -- it's one of dozens of businesses she owns,

834
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,680
<28-8,ESPOSITO>并不是所有生意都蒸蒸日上
<28-8,ESPOSITO>and not all of them are on the up-and-up.

835
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:41,700
<28-9,RYAN>有组织犯罪科说
<28-9,RYAN>Organized crime tells us

836
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:44,300
<28-9,RYAN>传闻谭咪咪和贩卖人口有关联
<28-9,RYAN>that Mimi Tan's rumored to be linked to human trafficking.

837
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:46,530
<28-10,ESPOSITO>她雇佣非法劳工
<28-10,ESPOSITO>She staffs her businesses with illegals

838
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:49,020
<28-10,ESPOSITO>通过三合会从中国偷运人口
<28-10,ESPOSITO>that she smuggles from China via a network of triads.

839
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,680
<28-11,RYAN>但她现在想要洗白
<28-11,RYAN>But now she's looking to go legit,

840
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,110
<28-11,RYAN>把开发唐人街
<28-11,RYAN>and shes sees the Chinatown development

841
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:53,470
<28-11,RYAN>作为其社会地位的筹码
<28-11,RYAN>as her ticket to respectability.

842
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:54,720
<28-12,ZHANG>所以亨利每天
<28-12,ZHANG>So the fact that Henry was eating

843
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:57,300
<28-12,ZHANG>去她的餐厅用餐并不是巧合
<28-12,ZHANG>at her restaurant every day is not a coincidence.

844
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,210
<28-13,CASTLE>咪咪一定是说服了她的"头号顾客"
<28-13,CASTLE>Mimi must have persuaded her "Number-one customer"

845
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:01,650
<28-13,CASTLE>把毒品栽赃给沃德罗以铲除竞争对手
<28-13,CASTLE>to plant those drugs on Wadlow to eliminate the competition.

846
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:03,730
<28-14,BECKETT>然后  一旦亨利完成使命
<28-14,BECKETT>And then, once Henry completed his task,

847
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,290
<28-14,BECKETT>咪咪就把他铲除了
<28-14,BECKETT>Mimi had him eliminated.

848
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:06,770
<28-15,ZHANG>但是  怎么证明这些呢
<28-15,ZHANG>Only, how do we prove it?

849
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:08,810
<28-16,BECKETT>我们得找出点有力证据
<28-16,BECKETT>We're gonna need something stronger

850
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:10,320
<28-16,BECKETT>不仅仅是特价午餐
<28-16,BECKETT>than just the lunch special.

851
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,200
<28-17,RYAN>就等你问了
<28-17,RYAN>Well, ask and ye shall receive.

852
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,710
<28-17,RYAN>还记得我们在亨利鞋底找到的
<28-17,RYAN>Do you remember that phenol-formaldehyde resin

853
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:16,730
<28-17,RYAN>苯酚甲醛树脂吗
<28-17,RYAN>that the lab found on the bottom of Henry's shoes?

854
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:19,820
<28-17,RYAN>它可能来自一家制衣厂
<28-17,RYAN>Well, it might have come from a garment factory

855
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:21,760
<28-17,RYAN>距离亨利中枪的公园只有几个街区
<28-17,RYAN>a few blocks away from the park where Henry was shot.

856
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,680
<28-18,CASTLE>为什么这么说
<28-18,CASTLE>What makes you say that?

857
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,750
<28-19,RYAN>因为那家工厂是谭咪咪的
<28-19,RYAN>Because that factory is owned by Mimi Tan.

858
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:37,810
<29-1,MIMI>又见面啦
<29-1,MIMI>Hello again.

859
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:40,270
<29-1,MIMI>这回是来享用晚餐吗
<29-1,MIMI>Joining us for dinner this time, I hope?

860
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,350
<29-1,MIMI>不  不是今晚
<29-1,MIMI>Uh, no, not tonight.

861
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:42,170
<29-2,BECKET>其实我们是想
<29-2,BECKET>Actually, we were hoping

862
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:43,530
<29-2,BECKET>你能协助我们
<29-2,BECKET>that you could help us a little more

863
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:46,280
<29-2,BECKET>调查亨利的凶案
<29-2,BECKET>with Henry's murder investigation.

864
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:48,340
<29-3,MIMI>当然可以  我能做些什么
<29-3,MIMI>Of course -- whatever I can do to help.

865
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,060
<29-4,BECKETT>杰弗瑞·沃德罗  你认识他吗
<29-4,BECKETT>Jeffrey Wadlow -- do you know him?

866
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:52,370
<29-4,BECKETT>他是本地开发商
<29-4,BECKETT>He's a local developer.

867
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:55,660
<29-5,MIMI>我知道他  很不择手段的一个人
<29-5,MIMI>I know of him -- very unscrupulous.

868
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:56,640
<29-6,ZHANG>或许如此
<29-6,ZHANG>Perhaps so.

869
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,760
<29-6,ZHANG>几天前他因贩毒被捕了
<29-6,ZHANG>He was arrested for drug charges the other day.

870
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,200
<29-7,MIMI>他运气真不好
<29-7,MIMI>How unfortunate for him.

871
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,890
<29-8,ZHANG>所以你就走运了
<29-8,ZHANG>Oh, and how fortunate for you.

872
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:03,380
<29-8,ZHANG>沃德罗入狱
<29-8,ZHANG>Wadlow goes to prison,

873
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:05,600
<29-8,ZHANG>他近期所有的不动产交易都黄了
<29-8,ZHANG>all his recent real-estate deals fall apart.

874
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,610
<29-9,BECKETT>你的公司就有机会接盘
<29-9,BECKETT>Making room for your company to swoop in

875
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:10,140
<29-9,BECKETT>买下许多唐人街的产业
<29-9,BECKETT>and buy numerous Chinatown properties.

876
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:12,070
<29-10,MIMI>这跟亨利的死有什么关系
<29-10,MIMI>And what does this have to do with Henry's death?

877
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:14,930
<29-11,BECKETT>你让亨利把毒品放到沃德罗的车里
<29-11,BECKETT>You enlisted Henry to plant those drugs in Wadlow's car

878
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:16,610
<29-11,BECKETT>帮你铲除竞争对手
<29-11,BECKETT>to get rid of your competition.

879
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:18,710
<29-12,MIMI>-太荒谬了  -是吗
<29-12,MIMI>- That's absurd. - Is it?

880
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:20,420
<29-13,BECKETT>我们在亨利的鞋底发现了
<29-13,BECKETT>We found phenol-formaldehyde resin

881
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,510
<29-13,BECKETT>苯酚甲醛树脂
<29-13,BECKETT>under Henry's shoe --

882
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:24,030
<29-13,BECKETT>和你那家制衣厂用的是同种材料
<29-13,BECKETT>the same kind that's used at your garment factory

883
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:25,540
<29-13,BECKETT>就在犯罪现场附近
<29-13,BECKETT>near the crime scene.

884
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:27,120
<29-14,ZHANG>我们找了几个工人询问
<29-14,ZHANG>We talked to several of your workers

885
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,040
<29-14,ZHANG>他们看到在亨利被杀当晚
<29-14,ZHANG>who saw you with Henry at the factory

886
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,450
<29-14,ZHANG>你和他在工厂见面
<29-14,ZHANG>the night he was murdered.

887
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:32,470
<29-15,MIMI>我现在就要见我的律师
<29-15,MIMI>I want to talk to my lawyer now.

888
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:33,540
<29-16,ZHANG>你为什么这么做
<29-16,ZHANG>Why did you do it?

889
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:35,280
<29-16,ZHANG>过河拆桥  是吗
<29-16,ZHANG>To tie up loose ends? Is that it?

890
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,590
<29-17,MIMI>我不会再说一句话  直到...
<29-17,MIMI>I'm not saying another word until --

891
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:40,050
<29-18,ZHU YIN>是你  是你杀了他
<29-18,ZHU YIN>It was you! You killed him!

892
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:41,460
<29-19,BECKETT>等等
<29-19,BECKETT>Wait! Hey!

894
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:48,790
<29-21,BECKETT>亨利来这不是为了吃东西
<29-21,BECKETT>Henry didn't come here for the food.

895
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,300
<29-22,ZHANG>他来这里是为了你
<29-22,ZHANG>He came here for you.

896
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:53,640
<29-23,ZHU YIN>他本来要带我离开的  还我自由
<29-23,ZHU YIN>He was going to take me away -- free me!

897
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,430
<29-23,ZHU YIN>可你杀了他
<29-23,ZHU YIN>And you kill him!

898
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:57,430
<29-24,MIMI>我没有杀亨利
<29-24,MIMI>I did not kill Henry.

899
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:58,620
<29-25,ZHU YIN>你说谎
<29-25,ZHU YIN>You lie!

900
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:00,670
<29-26,BECKETT>你说他来还你自由什么意思
<29-26,BECKETT>What do you mean, he came here to free you?

901
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:04,840
<29-27,ZHU YIN>我欠把我偷渡来的人很多钱
<29-27,ZHU YIN>I owe much money to the smugglers who bring me here.

902
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:07,000
<29-27,ZHU YIN>她还清了欠款
<29-27,ZHU YIN>She buy my debt.

903
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,410
<29-27,ZHU YIN>我要在这打工很多年还债
<29-27,ZHU YIN>I work here to pay it off for years.

904
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:12,380
<29-28,MIMI>你胡说
<29-28,MIMI>That's not true.

905
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:14,720
<29-29,ZHANG>然后你见到了亨利
<29-29,ZHANG>And then you met Henry.

906
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:17,300
<29-30,ZHU YIN>他想跟我一起生活
<29-30,ZHU YIN>He want us to start a life together.

907
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:19,490
<29-30,ZHU YIN>他找咪咪想赎回我
<29-30,ZHU YIN>He went to Mimi to pay my debt --

908
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,650
<29-30,ZHU YIN>四万美元
<29-30,ZHU YIN>$40,000.

909
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:25,450
<29-31,BECKETT>亨利没那么多钱
<29-31,BECKETT>And Henry didn't have that kind of cash,

910
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:28,340
<29-31,BECKETT>于是你们就苏颖的自由达成了另一个协议
<29-31,BECKETT>So you made a different agreement for Suyin's release.

911
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:31,060
<29-32,ZHANG>你让亨利栽赃沃德罗换取她的自由
<29-32,ZHANG>You had Henry frame Wadlow for her freedom.

912
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,170
<29-33,ZHU YIN>他为我那么做了
