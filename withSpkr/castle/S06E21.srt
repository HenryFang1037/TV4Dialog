00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,990
<1-1,RICHARD CASTLE>H-O-I-V-L
<1-1,RICHARD CASTLE>H-O-I-V-L.

7
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:02,630
<1-1,RICHARD CASTLE>Vlohi
<1-1,RICHARD CASTLE>Vlohi.

9
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:06,980
<1-1,RICHARD CASTLE>Hovil  不对  那不是单词
<1-1,RICHARD CASTLE>Hovil. No. That's not a word, either.

11
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,390
<1-2,KATE BECKETT>你真的一整夜没上床睡觉
<1-2,KATE BECKETT>Did you seriously stay up staring at this scrabble board

12
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:11,670
<1-2,KATE BECKETT>就盯着这拼字板看吗
<1-2,KATE BECKETT>all night instead of going to bed?

14
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,150
<1-3,CASTLE>我得用剩下的这五个字母
<1-3,CASTLE>With these five remaining tiles,

15
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:16,510
<1-3,CASTLE>拼出一个单词  就能得9分
<1-3,CASTLE>I have to craft a word scoring 9 points,

16
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,030
<1-3,CASTLE>那我就能反败为胜了
<1-3,CASTLE>and I turn defeat into victory.

17
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:22,610
<1-4,ALEXIS CASTLE>天呐  你真的赢过我爸了
<1-4,ALEXIS CASTLE>Oh, my gosh. Did you really beat dad at scrabble?

18
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:25,980
<1-5,CASTLE>我可没承认  我要再倒点咖啡去
<1-5,CASTLE>I concede nothing, except that I need more coffee.

19
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,890
<1-6,MARTHA RODGERS>你可真了不起
<1-6,MARTHA RODGERS>That is quite an accomplishment, young lady.

20
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:29,580
<1-6,MARTHA RODGERS>从来没人能赢他呢
<1-6,MARTHA RODGERS>Nobody beats him -- ever.

21
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,230
<1-7,BECKETT>对啊  这话他总挂在嘴边
<1-7,BECKETT>Oh, yeah. He's mentioned that... repeatedly.

22
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:35,990
<1-8,MARTHA>真可惜  伟人都失手了呢
<1-8,MARTHA>Ahh, how the mighty have fallen. Mm.

23
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:38,270
<1-9,CASTLE>"理查德·卡塞尔  败于某单词"
<1-9,CASTLE>"Richard castle. One word short."

24
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:40,540
<1-9,CASTLE>我不能让这话成为我的墓志铭
<1-9,CASTLE>I cannot allow this to be my epitaph.

25
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:41,810
<1-10,CASTLE>偷着点乐呗
<1-10,CASTLE>I saw that.

27
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,720
<2-1,CASTLE>好吧  我承认败给你了  谢谢
<2-1,CASTLE>Okay, I'll admit defeat Thanks.

28
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,810
<2-1,CASTLE>因为我爱你
<2-1,CASTLE>Because I love you.

29
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,640
<2-2,BECKETT>我已经赢你了你还"让"我赢
<2-2,BECKETT>You're letting me win after I already won.

30
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:54,570
<2-3,CASTLE>不过我们今晚得再比一次
<2-3,CASTLE>Under the condition that we have a rematch tonight.

31
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,750
<2-4,BECKETT>瞧瞧你又在修改投降条款
<2-4,BECKETT>Oh, wow. Now you're dictating the terms of surrender.

32
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:59,330
<2-5,CASTLE>你直接说接不接受吧
<2-5,CASTLE>Take it or leave it, please.

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,010
<2-7,BECKETT>发生了什么
<2-7,BECKETT>So, what happened here?

34
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:04,480
<2-8,ESPOSITO>据我们的...证人说
<2-8,ESPOSITO>Well, according to our... witness,

35
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,560
<2-8,ESPOSITO>这个叫罗根·摩尔的死者
<2-8,ESPOSITO>our victim, one Logan Moore,

36
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,450
<2-8,ESPOSITO>当时正踩着滑板逃命
<2-8,ESPOSITO>was hauling ass on a skateboard

37
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:10,160
<2-8,ESPOSITO>后面有个骑摩托车的人在追他
<2-8,ESPOSITO>with a guy on a motorcycle chasing him.

38
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,690
<2-9,CASTLE>听着像是动作片里的场景
<2-9,CASTLE>Sounds like a scene from an action movie.

39
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:14,310
<2-10,ESPOSITO>对啊  特别是后来摩托车手开枪
<2-10,ESPOSITO>Yeah, I know, especially when the biker started shooting

40
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,910
<2-10,ESPOSITO>而罗根摔下了那边那扇窗子
<2-10,ESPOSITO>and Logan crashed through that window right there.

41
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:18,070
<2-11,BECKETT>死者身上有没有什么线索能解释这一切呢
<2-11,BECKETT>Anything about our victim that'll explain what happened?

42
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:21,260
<2-12,ESPOSITO>还没有  只知道他21岁  持有加州驾照
<2-12,ESPOSITO>Not yet -- just that he's 21, has a California driver's license.

43
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,850
<2-12,ESPOSITO>这是我们目前找到的所有线索
<2-12,ESPOSITO>About all we got at this point.

44
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,430
<2-13,BECKETT>那目击证人能描述这位摩托车手吗
<2-13,BECKETT>So, this biker -- was our witness able to give a description?

45
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,330
<2-14,ESPOSITO>证人宿醉未醒
<2-14,ESPOSITO>Our witness is royally wasted.

46
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:31,090
<2-14,ESPOSITO>他只知道大约3点到4点间
<2-14,ESPOSITO>All he knows is that sometime between 3:00 and 4:00,

47
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:33,190
<2-14,ESPOSITO>这儿上演了一段《夺命狂奔》
<2-14,ESPOSITO>it was "Death race 2000" Out here.

48
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,160
<2-14,ESPOSITO>证据显示他说的是对的
<2-14,ESPOSITO>The evidence backs him up, too.

49
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,000
<2-14,ESPOSITO>鉴证组在那片泥土上发现了清晰的轮胎印
<2-14,ESPOSITO>CSU found fresh tire tracks in that dirt over there.

50
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,260
<2-14,ESPOSITO>现在他们正在做模型
<2-14,ESPOSITO>They're making casts as we speak.

51
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,820
<2-15,CASTLE>那么这要么是史上最残忍的驾驶暴怒
<2-15,CASTLE>So either this is the worst case of road rage ever

52
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,630
<2-15,CASTLE>要么就是有人决心杀死罗根·摩尔
<2-15,CASTLE>or someone was hell-bent on killing Logan Moore.

53
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,440
<2-15,CASTLE>但为什么呢
<2-15,CASTLE>But why?

54
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:49,000
<2-16,BECKETT>为什么他凌晨3  4点间在外玩滑板呢
<2-16,BECKETT>And why was he out skateboarding between 3:00 and 4:00 a.m.?

55
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,750
<2-17,LANIE PARISH>如果他是要呼吸新鲜空气的话  那他如愿了
<2-17,LANIE PARISH>Well, if he needed some fresh air, he got some --

56
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,580
<2-17,LANIE PARISH>因为他后背打通了三个孔
<2-17,LANIE PARISH>by way of three holes in his back

57
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,610
<2-17,LANIE PARISH>用的是9毫米口径的中空弹
<2-17,LANIE PARISH>from .9mm hollow-points.

58
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,210
<2-18,KEVIN RYAN>凶手情况不详
<2-18,KEVIN RYAN>So, no eyes on the shooter.

59
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,450
<2-18,KEVIN RYAN>这片区域没有安装监控摄像头
<2-18,KEVIN RYAN>There's no security-cam coverage in this area.

60
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:00,570
<2-19,BECKETT>死者不是本地人
<2-19,BECKETT>Our victim's from out of town,

61
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:02,280
<2-19,BECKETT>他肯定得找个地方住
<2-19,BECKETT>so he had to have been staying somewhere.

62
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,770
<2-19,BECKETT>你找到酒店钥匙或者收据了吗
<2-19,BECKETT>Did you find a hotel key or a receipt?

63
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:08,270
<2-20,RYAN>确实在他脖子上找到了这把钥匙
<2-20,RYAN>Well, we did find this key hung around his neck

64
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:10,740
<2-20,RYAN>他口袋里有这张纸片
<2-20,RYAN>And this scrap of paper in his pocket.

65
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:11,990
<2-20,RYAN>上面写着西格林威治的一个地址
<2-20,RYAN>It's a west village address.

66
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:13,100
<2-21,BECKETT>你和埃斯波西托去查这个地址
<2-21,BECKETT>You and Esposito check that out.

67
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,130
<2-21,BECKETT>我和卡塞尔去找找死者的线索
<2-21,BECKETT>Castle and I will see what we can find out about our victim.

68
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,310
<2-21,BECKETT>能等我一会儿吗
<2-21,BECKETT>Can you just hang on for one second for me?

69
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,290
<2-22,BECKETT>蕾妮  裙子你抽空试穿了吗
<2-22,BECKETT>Hey, Lanie. Were you able to schedule the fitting for your dress?

70
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:21,240

71
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,320
<2-23,LANIE>你帮我挑的那条裙子简直太赞了
<2-23,LANIE>And the dress that you picked out for me is gorgeous.

72
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,460
<2-23,LANIE>是高雅和俏皮的完美结合啊
<2-23,LANIE>It's the right mix of elegant and saucy.

73
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,320
<2-24,BECKETT>我当然得小心伺候我的伴娘大人啦
<2-24,BECKETT>Well, I had to do right by my maid of honor.

74
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,420
<2-25,BECKETT>-好了  我得走了  回见  -好
<2-25,BECKETT>- Okay, I got to go. I'll see you. - All right.

<2-27,LANIE>So, did we hear right?

77
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,810
<2-28,ESPOSITO>你是贝克特的伴娘吗
<2-28,ESPOSITO>Are you Beckett's maid of honor?

78
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:40,370
<2-29,LANIE>对啊  前几天她来跟我讲的
<2-29,LANIE>Yeah, she asked me the other day.

79
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,030
<2-30,RYAN>那你知道卡塞尔的伴郎是谁吗
<2-30,RYAN>Do you have any idea who Castle's best man is?

80
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:44,480
<2-31,LANIE>首先  该说"恭喜啦  蕾妮"
<2-31,LANIE>First, "Congratulations, lanie."

81
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,180
<2-31,LANIE>多谢
<2-31,LANIE>Oh! Thank you!

82
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:49,150
<2-31,LANIE>其次  我不知道卡塞尔选伴郎了没啊
<2-31,LANIE>Second, I don't know if he's picked anyone yet.

83
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:52,000
<2-33,LANIE>你俩真觉得他会在你们中选一个
<2-33,LANIE>You...really think it's one of you?

84
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:53,410
<2-33,LANIE>你们啊
<2-33,LANIE>You two.

86
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,730
<3-1,RYAN>面对现实吧
<3-1,RYAN>Reality of it is,

87
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,440
<3-1,RYAN>卡塞尔有好些名人朋友
<3-1,RYAN>is that castle's friends with famous people,

88
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:05,280
<3-1,RYAN>像詹姆斯·帕特森啊  史蒂芬·金之类的
<3-1,RYAN>like James Patterson and Stephen King.

89
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:05,810
<3-2,ESPOSITO>谁
<3-2,ESPOSITO>Who?

90
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,840
<3-3,ESPOSITO>拜托  你真觉得卡塞尔会从那些人里挑伴郎
<3-3,ESPOSITO>Come on, man -- you really think castle wants one of those guys

91
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,780
<3-3,ESPOSITO>来见证他婚礼的神圣时刻吗
<3-3,ESPOSITO>standing beside him when he ties the knot?

92
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:11,900
<3-4,RYAN>嗯  有道理
<3-4,RYAN>You know, maybe you're right.

93
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,250
<3-4,RYAN>过去这么些年  卡塞尔几乎
<3-4,RYAN>Castle's spent practically every day in the precinct

94
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,050
<3-4,RYAN>每天都在局里
<3-4,RYAN>for the past few years.

95
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:16,750
<3-4,RYAN>他没道理不选我们做他的伴郎的
<3-4,RYAN>Why wouldn't he ask one of us to be his best man?

96
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,350
<3-5,ESPOSITO>你肯定想说他没道理不选你当伴郎
<3-5,ESPOSITO>Why wouldn't he pick me to be his best man, is what you mean.

97
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,420
<3-6,RYAN>哈维  很明显该选我嘛
<3-6,RYAN>Oh, Javi. I'm the obvious choice.

98
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,450
<3-6,RYAN>这你还不明白  我也没法解释
<3-6,RYAN>If you can't see it, I can't explain it to you.

<4-1,HOLLY>我住在洛杉矶的时候经常和罗根一起玩
<4-1,HOLLY>Me and Logan hung out when I lived in L.A.

102
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,710
<4-1,HOLLY>我很喜欢他
<4-1,HOLLY>I really liked him.

103
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,230
<4-2,RYAN>霍莉  那他是和你住一起吗
<4-2,RYAN>Was he staying with you, Holly?

104
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:39,190
<4-2,RYAN>这是你公寓的钥匙吗
<4-2,RYAN>Is this a key to your apartment?

105
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:40,980
<4-2,RYAN>不是
<4-2,RYAN>No.

106
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,820
<4-3,HOLLY>我不知道他待在哪
<4-3,HOLLY>I-I don't know where he was crashing.

107
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,340
<4-4,ESPOSITO>那他来看你了吗
<4-4,ESPOSITO>Well, did he stop by?

108
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,270
<4-4,ESPOSITO>他口袋里有你的住址
<4-4,ESPOSITO>'cause your address was in his pocket.

109
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,080
<4-5,HOLLY>对  他来过  但很奇怪
<4-5,HOLLY>Yeah, he did, but it was weird.

110
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,430
<4-5,HOLLY>上星期罗根突然给我打电话
<4-5,HOLLY>Logan called last week out of the blue.

111
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:54,500
<4-5,HOLLY>他要坐飞机来  还问我
<4-5,HOLLY>He was flying into town, and he asked

112
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,580
<4-5,HOLLY>能不能把一个小盒子寄过来
<4-5,HOLLY>if he can have a small box shipped here.

113
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,520
<4-6,ESPOSITO>盒子要是不大的话
<4-6,ESPOSITO>Well, if it was small,

114
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,020
<4-6,ESPOSITO>他为什么不自己带上飞机呢
<4-6,ESPOSITO>why didn't he just take it with him on the plane?

115
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,330
<4-7,HOLLY>他说不想和运输安全局打交道
<4-7,HOLLY>He didn't want to deal with TSA

116
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:03,020
<4-7,HOLLY>运输安全局总给他添麻烦
<4-7,HOLLY>because he said they always gave him a hard time.

117
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,030
<4-8,RYAN>盒子里有什么
<4-8,RYAN>What was in the box?

118
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:07,740
<4-9,HOLLY>他的滑板工具什么的
<4-9,HOLLY>Um, his...skateboard tools and stuff.

119
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,300
<4-9,HOLLY>至少他是这么告诉我的
<4-9,HOLLY>At least, that's what he said.

120
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,830
<4-10,RYAN>但你不相信他吧
<4-10,RYAN>But you didn't believe him.

121
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:13,870
<4-11,HOLLY>就是他来拿盒子的时候表现得很奇怪
<4-11,HOLLY>It's just, when he came to get it, he acted kind of strange.

122
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:15,710
<4-11,HOLLY>他看到盒子上的胶带松了点
<4-11,HOLLY>He noticed some tape had come loose on the box,

123
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:18,590
<4-11,HOLLY>就非常紧张
<4-11,HOLLY>And...he freaked out.

124
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:20,550
<4-11,HOLLY>让我发誓我没打开盒子
<4-11,HOLLY>He made me swear I hadn't opened it.

125
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,430
<4-12,RYAN>霍莉  你知道盒子里有什么吗
<4-12,RYAN>Holly, do you have any idea what was in that box?

126
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:23,210
<4-13,HOLLY>不知道
<4-13,HOLLY>I don't know.

127
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:25,730
<4-13,HOLLY>我真不知道
<4-13,HOLLY>I-I really don't.

128
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:27,870
<4-14,ESPOSITO>你知道他为什么来这儿吗
<4-14,ESPOSITO>Do you know why he flew into town in the first place?

129
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:28,500
<4-15,HOLLY>为了比赛
<4-15,HOLLY>For the games.

130
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:29,520
<4-16,RYAN>什么比赛
<4-16,RYAN>What games?

131
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:31,630
<4-17,HOLLY>罗根是个职业滑板手
<4-17,HOLLY>Logan was a pro skateboarder.

132
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:34,400
<4-17,HOLLY>他是来参加纽约街头体育节的
<4-17,HOLLY>He was here for the New York Street Sports Festival,

133
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:36,020
<4-17,HOLLY>就在切尔西码头
<4-17,HOLLY>down by Chelsea Piers.

134
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:42,830
<5-1,BECKETT>那个街头体育节昨天开始了
<5-1,BECKETT>Okay, so, the street sports festival kicked off yesterday.

135
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,680
<5-1,BECKETT>罗根·摩尔参加了
<5-1,BECKETT>Logan Moore was entered

136
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,650
<5-1,BECKETT>街头滑板赛
<5-1,BECKETT>into the street-style skateboarding event

137
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,640
<5-1,BECKETT>而且有望夺冠
<5-1,BECKETT>and favored to win.

138
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,450
<5-1,BECKETT>他的人气还在上涨中
<5-1,BECKETT>His star was on the rise.

139
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,740
<5-2,CASTLE>而且加上他卑微的出身就更令人佩服了
<5-2,CASTLE>It's all the more impressive given his humble origins.

140
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:54,890
<5-2,CASTLE>简历上写着罗根出生于布朗克斯区
<5-2,CASTLE>Logan's bio says he was born in the Bronx.

141
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:57,670
<5-2,CASTLE>在他母亲入狱后他一直在寄养家庭中辗转
<5-2,CASTLE>He bounced around foster care after his mother went to prison.

142
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:59,690
<5-2,CASTLE>之后他去了加利福尼亚  成了滑板手
<5-2,CASTLE>Then he ran off to California, made his mark as a skater,

143
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:00,340
<5-2,CASTLE>一心一意干了这行
<5-2,CASTLE>and never looked back.

144
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,720
<5-3,BECKETT>接着被一个带枪摩托车手干掉了
<5-3,BECKETT>And then he was killed by a gun-wielding biker.

145
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:05,120
<5-4,CASTLE>这点虽然简历上没写  但是这事不简单
<5-4,CASTLE>Not in the bio, but, obviously, there's more to the story.

146
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,690
<5-5,RYAN>鉴证科辨认出了案发现场的车辙
<5-5,RYAN>Hey. So, CSU I.D.ed those tracks at the scene.

147
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:11,440
<5-5,RYAN>是米其林S12系列越野轮胎
<5-5,RYAN>They were made by michelin S12s, a type of off-road tire.

148
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,400
<5-6,BECKETT>为什么要在街上骑越野车
<5-6,BECKETT>Why would someone ride an off-road bike on the streets?

149
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,150
<5-6,BECKETT>完全是浪费越野胎啊
<5-6,BECKETT>That would just wear the tires down to nothing.

150
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:18,090
<5-7,RYAN>除非那是凶手唯一能用的轮胎
<5-7,RYAN>Unless it's the only type of bike the killer had access to.

151
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:20,020
<5-7,RYAN>体育节的一个重要项目就是摩托车越野赛
<5-7,RYAN>One of the main events at the games is motocross,

152
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:21,510
<5-7,RYAN>他们用的正是这种轮胎
<5-7,RYAN>and those are the tires they use.

153
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:24,200
<5-7,RYAN>鉴证科在查是否有符合现场车辙的车
<5-7,RYAN>CSU's checking to see if any of those are a match to the tarck.

154
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:24,800
<5-8,BECKETT>好的
<5-8,BECKETT>Okay, good.

155
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,600
<5-9,CASTLE>那么  凶手可能是比赛相关人员
<5-9,CASTLE>So, our killer could be connected to the games.

156
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,190
<5-10,ESPOSITO>我打赌是曼尼·卡斯特罗
<5-10,ESPOSITO>Yep. And I'm laying money it was Manny Castro.

157
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,290
<5-11,BECKETT>曼尼·卡斯特罗是谁
<5-11,BECKETT>And who is Manny Castro?

158
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:34,220
<5-12,ESPOSITO>一个和罗根有嫌隙的职业滑板手
<5-12,ESPOSITO>A top pro who had beef with Logan.

159
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:37,250
<5-12,ESPOSITO>六个月前  罗根在洛杉矶赢了他
<5-12,ESPOSITO>Six months ago, Logan showed him up at an event in Los Angeles,

160
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,150
<5-12,ESPOSITO>之后又赢过他两次
<5-12,ESPOSITO>then beat him two more times after that.

161
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:41,020
<5-12,ESPOSITO>他俩的关系已经剑拔弩张了
<5-12,ESPOSITO>Tension got super-high between the two of them.

162
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:44,700
<5-13,BECKETT>一个无法接受失败的擂主
<5-13,BECKETT>Oh. A reigning champion unable to cope with defeat,

163
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:46,400
<5-13,BECKETT>怎么有点耳熟呢
<5-13,BECKETT>that sounds familiar.

164
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,050
<5-14,ESPOSITO>结果昨天  他俩动手了
<5-14,ESPOSITO>Yeah, but then yesterday, things got physical.

165
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,710
<5-14,ESPOSITO>一个粉丝在YouTube上发的
<5-14,ESPOSITO>A fan posted this on YouTube.

166
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,000
<5-15,MANNY CASTRO>我跟你说话呢  罗根
<5-15,MANNY CASTRO>Hey! I'm talking to you, Logan!

167
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,290
<5-15,MANNY CASTRO>你敢不理我
<5-15,MANNY CASTRO>You think you can just walk away from me?!

168
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:54,330
<5-16,LOGAN>放开我
<5-16,LOGAN>Get off me, man!

<6-3,BECKETT>我觉得追凶就挺极限了
<6-3,BECKETT>Well, I mean, I think catching killers is pretty extreme.

00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,060
<6-3,BECKETT>嫁给你也是
<6-3,BECKETT>And then there's marrying you.

188
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,490
<7-1,MANNY>罗根没来比赛
<7-1,MANNY>When Logan didn't show up for the event,

189
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:01,890
<7-1,MANNY>我也不知道他怎么了
<7-1,MANNY>I-I didn't know what to think,

190
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:03,220
<7-1,MANNY>但我可没杀他

<7-2,BECKETT>after he beat you in L.A.

193

<7-3,CASTLE>还有奥斯汀市和坦帕市的失败
<7-3,CASTLE>And in Austin. And tampa.

<7-4,MANNY>我总是说大话  粉丝们就喜欢这个
<7-4,MANNY>I talk a lot of trash. The fans go nuts for it.

195
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:12,720
<7-4,MANNY>那只是表演而已
<7-4,MANNY>It's all part of the show.

196
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,190
<7-5,BECKETT>我们去问过你所在旅馆的前台了
<7-5,BECKETT>We talked to the front desk at your hotel.

197
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:16,120
<7-5,BECKETT>他们说你昨晚10点左右离开后
<7-5,BECKETT>They say that you left at 10:00 p.M. Last night

198
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,840
<7-5,BECKETT>今天凌晨5点才回来
<7-5,BECKETT>and you didn't come back until 5:00 a.M.

199
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,760
<7-6,MANNY>我找了个女孩
<7-6,MANNY>I hooked up with a girl.

200
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,040
<7-6,MANNY>她能证明我昨晚和她在一起
<7-6,MANNY>She'll tell you I was with her all night.

201
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,490
<7-7,BECKETT>我相信她会的
<7-7,BECKETT>Yeah, I'm sure she will.

202
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,010
<7-7,BECKETT>但是你昨天威胁罗根的视频
<7-7,BECKETT>But that video of you threatening Logan yesterday,

203
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:26,150
<7-7,BECKETT>将是更难以辩驳的证据
<7-7,BECKETT>that's gonna be a lot harder to explain away.

204
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:27,870
<7-8,MANNY>不是那样的
<7-8,MANNY>No. That's not what it looks like.

205
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:30,310
<7-9,CASTLE>是吗  看起来也什么歧义啊
<7-9,CASTLE>Really? 'cause it looks like it is what it looks like.

206
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,360
<7-10,MANNY>就在视频的事发生之前
<7-10,MANNY>Listen, right before that video was taken,

207
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:35,490
<7-10,MANNY>我抓到罗根在翻摩托车比赛办公室
<7-10,MANNY>I caught Logan ransacking the festival mobile office, all right?

208
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:36,960
<7-11,CASTLE>什么叫翻  捣乱吗
<7-11,CASTLE>Ransacking as in trashing?

209
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,050
<7-12,MANNY>更像是在找东西
<7-12,MANNY>It was more like he was looking for something.

210
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:41,000
<7-13,BECKETT>-找什么  -我不知道
<7-13,BECKETT>- Like what? - I don't know.

211
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,330
<7-14,MANNY>他也不愿说  所以我才找他的麻烦的
<7-14,MANNY>And he wouldn't explain himself, so I got up in his face.

212
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,000
<7-14,MANNY>那才是视频里的发生事
<7-14,MANNY>That's what was on the videotape.

213
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,010
<7-15,CASTLE>你告发他了吗
<7-15,CASTLE>You report it?

214
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:47,420
<7-16,MANNY>我本来要告诉汤姆·弗顿的
<7-16,MANNY>I was gonna tell Tom Fulton,

215
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,310
<7-16,MANNY>就是体育节的执行总裁
<7-16,MANNY>the festival C.E.O.,

216
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:50,450
<7-16,MANNY>但是他求我不要  所以我就没说
<7-16,MANNY>But he begged me not to, so I kept my mouth shut.

217
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:51,700
<7-17,BECKETT>你为什么要这么做
<7-17,BECKETT>And why would you do that for him?

218
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,730
<7-18,MANNY>罗根求我保密24小时
<7-18,MANNY>Logan asked me for 24 hours.

219
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:55,850
<7-18,MANNY>他发誓说这事关乎生死
<7-18,MANNY>He swore it was a matter of life and death.

220
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,020
<7-18,MANNY>看来还真是这样
<7-18,MANNY>I guess he was right.

230
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:19,350
<8-1,TOM FULTON>我能帮你什么吗
<8-1,TOM FULTON>Can I help you?

235
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:27,640

<8-3,FULTON>News just broke Logan Moore was killed.

236
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,970
<8-3,FULTON>我感到很难过
<8-3,FULTON>I'm sick about it.

237
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:31,340
<8-3,FULTON>你是来调查谋杀案还是闯入案的
<8-3,FULTON>You -- you here about that or the break-in.

<8-5,FULTON>两天前  他来这里训练时
<8-5,FULTON>Two days ago. He was here doing some practice runs.

<8-6,CASTLE>他有没有和这里的谁发生过争执
<8-6,CASTLE>Did he have any issues with anyone here

242
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:40,110
<8-6,CASTLE>或者在赛程中和谁有过冲突
<8-6,CASTLE>or trouble with anyone on the circuit?

243
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:41,750
<8-7,FULTON>大家都想赢
<8-7,FULTON>Oh, the guys play to win,

244
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,900
<8-7,FULTON>不过输赢只是赛场上的事
<8-7,FULTON>but it stays out in the park, you know?

245
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,550
<8-8,BECKETT>有什么东西被偷吗
<8-8,BECKETT>So, what was taken from here?

246
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:48,430
<8-9,FULTON>目前为止  我能确定丢失了的
<8-9,FULTON>Uh, so far, the only thing I know missing for sure

247
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:49,870
<8-9,FULTON>就是我的枪
<8-9,FULTON>I-is my gun.

248
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:53,240
<8-9,FULTON>我抽屉有把45毫米手枪  登记在册的
<8-9,FULTON>I kept a .45 in my desk -- legally registered.

249
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,740
<8-10,BECKETT>罗根知道你有枪吗
<8-10,BECKETT>Did Logan know about the gun?

250
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:57,030
<8-11,FULTON>你觉得进来的是罗根吗
<8-11,FULTON>What -- you think Logan broke in here?

251
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,760
<8-12,CASTLE>我猜这不像他的为人
<8-12,CASTLE>I'm assuming that would have been out of character?

252
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:02,070
<8-13,FULTON>当然不像  他可是下一个托尼·霍克[滑板高手]
<8-13,FULTON>Hell yes. He was on his way to becoming the next Tony Hawk.

253
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:04,800
<8-14,BECKETT>罗根有什么需要枪的理由吗
<8-14,BECKETT>Is there any reason that Logan would have needed a gun?

254
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:11,390
<8-15,FULTON>我了解罗根  他的童年很艰辛
<8-15,FULTON>I know Logan. He had a tough go of things growing up.

255
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:13,150
<8-15,FULTON>这也不是第一次这样的孩子
<8-15,FULTON>It wouldn't be the first time a kid like that

256
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,670
<8-16,CASTLE>和坏人搅在一起了
<8-16,CASTLE>fell in with a bad crowd.

257
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,670
<8-16,CASTLE>什么坏人
<8-16,CASTLE>What bad crowd?

258
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,560
<8-17,FULTON>罗根刚来登记时
<8-17,FULTON>When Logan first came here to register,

259
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,750
<8-17,FULTON>我记得他接到了一个很奇怪的电话
<8-17,FULTON>I remember he gets this weird phone call.

260
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,430
<8-17,FULTON>他接了电话说道  "那么多年了
<8-17,FULTON>He answers and he says, "You got some nerve

261
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:24,800
<8-17,FULTON>你居然还敢打电话让我干这事
<8-17,FULTON>"asking me to do this after all these years.

262
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,740
<8-17,FULTON>离我远点  别再给我来电话了"
<8-17,FULTON>"Stay the hell out of my life. Don't ever call me again."

263
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,010
<8-17,FULTON>然后他就把电话挂了
<8-17,FULTON>Then he hung up.

264
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,930
<8-18,BECKETT>你知道他在和谁通话吗
<8-18,BECKETT>Any idea who he was talking to?

265
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:32,770
<8-18,BECKETT>不知道
<8-18,BECKETT>No.

266
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:35,840
<8-19,FULTON>但当时他很惊慌失措
<8-19,FULTON>But he was pretty shook up.

267
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,900
<8-19,FULTON>如果他拿了我的枪然后被杀害
<8-19,FULTON>If he took my gun and someone killed him,

268
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:41,240
<8-19,FULTON>也许和这个有关联
<8-19,FULTON>maybe there's a connection.

269
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,270
<9-1,BECKETT>好的  谢谢
<9-1,BECKETT>Okay, thanks.

270
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:47,380
<9-3,BECKETT>曼尼·卡斯特罗的不在场证明核实了
<9-3,BECKETT>Hey. So, Manny Castro's alibi checks.

271
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,110
<9-3,BECKETT>而且我问过罗根的对手
<9-3,BECKETT>And I talked to Logan's competition.

272
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,320
<9-3,BECKETT>没有人记得
<9-3,BECKETT>None of them remember anything

273
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,560
<9-3,BECKETT>他和坏人混在一起
<9-3,BECKETT>about him hanging out with a bad crowd.

274
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:57,550
<9-4,CASTLE>如果坏人指的是一个邪恶的阴谋组织
<9-4,CASTLE>What if that bad crowd refers to an evil cabal

275
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:00,090
<9-4,CASTLE>雇佣极限运动员与死神搏斗
<9-4,CASTLE>that pays extreme athletes to duel to the death,

276
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,000
<9-4,CASTLE>只为让堕落的百万富翁牟利
<9-4,CASTLE>all for the benefit of depraved millionaires?

277
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,430
<9-5,BECKETT>你是说像电影《疯狂轮滑》那样吗
<9-5,BECKETT>You mean like the movie "Rollerball"?

278
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:06,260
<9-6,CASTLE>这就解释了"摩托车对阵滑板"谋杀案
<9-6,CASTLE>It would explain the "motorcycle VS. skateboard" murder.

279
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:09,040
<9-7,ESPOSITO>或者这和阿尔巴尼亚黑帮有关
<9-7,ESPOSITO>Or maybe it has something to do with the Albanian mob.

280
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,110
<9-8,BECKETT>-什么  -嗯
<9-8,BECKETT>- What?! - Yeah.

281
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,340
<9-9,ESPOSITO>根据他的电话记录
<9-9,ESPOSITO>According to his phone records,

282
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:13,160
<9-9,ESPOSITO>罗根接到多通布朗克斯
<9-9,ESPOSITO>Logan received a dozen calls

283
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,790
<9-9,ESPOSITO>一个社交俱乐部打来的电话
<9-9,ESPOSITO>from a social club in the Bronx.

284
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:17,190
<9-9,ESPOSITO>那是与组织犯罪有关的阿尔巴尼亚人开的
<9-9,ESPOSITO>The place is run by Albanians linked to organized crime.

285
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:21,060
<9-10,CASTLE>阿尔巴尼亚黑帮是不是以疯狂暴力而臭名远昭
<9-10,CASTLE>Isn't the Albanian mob infamous for being crazy-violent?

286
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,350
<9-11,BECKETT>看看能不能查出是谁从那个俱乐部打电话给他
<9-11,BECKETT>See if you can find out who was calling him from that club.

287
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,100
<9-11,BECKETT>马上去查
<9-11,BECKETT>I'm on it.

288
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,250
<9-12,ESPOSITO>卡塞尔  给你样东西
<9-12,ESPOSITO>Oh. Castle, I-I got something for you.

289
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,020
<9-12,ESPOSITO>你喜欢的那只笔
<9-12,ESPOSITO>It's that pen you liked.

290
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:30,000
<9-12,ESPOSITO>这可是传家宝
<9-12,ESPOSITO>It's an heirloom.

291
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,990
<9-13,CASTLE>-今天是什么日子  -没什么日子
<9-13,CASTLE>- What's the occasion? - There's no occasion.

292
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:33,960
<9-14,ESPOSITO>因为我们是哥们
<9-14,ESPOSITO>It's just 'cause we're -- 'cause we're bros.

293
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:35,470
<9-14,ESPOSITO>铁哥们
<9-14,ESPOSITO>Best bros.

294
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:37,990
<9-15,CASTLE>真是太正点了
<9-15,CASTLE>This is fantastic.

295
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:39,640
<9-16,BECKETT>才没有  多幼稚啊
<9-16,BECKETT>No, it's not. It's juvenile.

296
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,640
<9-16,BECKETT>那个
<9-16,BECKETT>So...

297
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:48,780
<9-17,RYAN>罗根的财务状况告诉了我们他住哪
<9-17,RYAN>Logan's financials got us a line on where he was staying.

298
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,530
<9-17,RYAN>整个礼拜  他都从GrubHub叫外卖
<9-17,RYAN>All week, he'd been ordering from GrubHub.

299
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:51,550
<9-18,BECKETT>你是说那家餐饮服务
<9-18,BECKETT>You mean the food service?

300
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,370
<9-19,RYAN>是的  他们送外卖到苏豪区的一个阁楼
<9-19,RYAN>Yeah, they were delivering meals to a loft in SoHo.

301
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,510
<9-20,CASTLE>是谁的阁楼
<9-20,CASTLE>Whose loft was it?

302
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,210
<9-21,RYAN>一个衣食无忧的孩子  喜欢和运动员开派对
<9-21,RYAN>Some trust-fund kid -- likes to party with the athletes.

303
00:11:58,210 --> 00:11:59,600
<9-21,RYAN>名字叫罗斯·迪·科宁
<9-21,RYAN>Guy named Ross De Koning.

304
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:05,800
<9-21,RYAN>漂亮  兄弟
<9-21,RYAN>Nice, brother.

305
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,090
<9-21,RYAN>也不是很难啦
<9-21,RYAN>It's not really all that hard.

306
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:08,570
<10-1,MAN>你能做得更好吗
<10-1,MAN>Oh, yeah. Like you could do better?

307
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:12,760
<10-2,BECKETT>你是罗斯·迪·科宁
<10-2,BECKETT>Um...hi. Ross De Koning?

308
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,090
<10-2,BECKETT>纽约警察局
<10-2,BECKETT>Uh, NYPD.

309
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:18,210
<10-3,ROSS DEKONING>我得说  这个派对随时欢迎你
<10-3,ROSS DEKONING>I just got to say, you can come party here anytime.

310
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,170
<10-3,ROSS DEKONING>明天你可以
<10-3,ROSS DEKONING>In fact, swing by tomorrow

311
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:22,280
<10-3,ROSS DEKONING>来参加我非常特别的21岁生日聚会
<10-3,ROSS DEKONING>for my very special 21st birthday bash.

312
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,150
<10-4,BECKETT>听起来挺诱人的
<10-4,BECKETT>Look, as tempting as that sounds.

313
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:26,620
<10-4,BECKETT>我们其实是想问你几个问题
<10-4,BECKETT>Um, we actually just need to ask you a few questions

314
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,930
<10-4,BECKETT>关于罗根·摩尔的
<10-4,BECKETT>about Logan Moore.

315
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:30,120
<10-5,ROSS>是的  我对发生的一切感到很沮丧
<10-5,ROSS>Oh, yeah. I was so bummed by what happened.

316
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,320
<10-6,BECKETT>我知道他一直住在这儿
<10-6,BECKETT>I understand that he had been staying here.

317
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,190
<10-7,ROSS>是的  我们曾一起玩过滑板
<10-7,ROSS>Oh, yeah. I mean, we used to skate together.

318
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:36,950
<10-7,ROSS>所以当他说想在这住  我立马就答应了
<10-7,ROSS>So when he asked to crash, I was like, "Absolutely."

319
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:38,970
<10-8,BECKETT>你看见他昨晚什么时候离开了吗
<10-8,BECKETT>And did you see him when he left last night?

320
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,000
<10-9,ROSS>没有  我没有注意到
<10-9,ROSS>No. I don't keep tabs.

321
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,480
<10-10,CASTLE>罗根搬去加州之前
<10-10,CASTLE>Before he moved to California,

322
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,310
<10-10,CASTLE>和阿尔巴尼亚黑帮有没有什么联系
<10-10,CASTLE>did Logan have any connections to the Albanian mob?

323
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:47,850
<10-10,CASTLE>天啊
<10-10,CASTLE>Oh, man.

324
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:50,460
<10-11,ROSS>你认为那个阿尔巴尼亚人杀了他
<10-11,ROSS>You think the Albanian killed him?

325
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,490
<10-12,CASTLE>什么阿尔巴尼亚人
<10-12,CASTLE>What Albanian?

326
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,040
<10-13,ROSS>我从没想过这点
<10-13,ROSS>That never even entered my mind.

327
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,360
<10-14,BECKETT>罗斯  什么阿尔巴尼亚人
<10-14,BECKETT>Ross, what Albanian?

328
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:56,980
<10-15,ROSS>那是五六年前
<10-15,ROSS>So, maybe five, six years ago,

329
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:00,260
<10-15,ROSS>罗根的妈妈和一个叫恩韦尔的男人约过会
<10-15,ROSS>Logan's mom dated this dude -- Enver.

330
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:02,320
<10-15,ROSS>他吸毒还干各种坏事
<10-15,ROSS>He was into drugs and all kinds of bad stuff.

331
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,590
<10-16,CASTLE>罗根和恩韦尔之间有过什么纠葛吗
<10-16,CASTLE>Was there ever any trouble between Logan and Enver?

332
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:05,650
<10-17,ROSS>很大的纠葛
<10-17,ROSS>Major trouble.

333
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,040
<10-17,ROSS>罗根把恩韦尔送进了监狱
<10-17,ROSS>Logan helped send Enver to prison,

334
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,060
<10-17,ROSS>恩韦尔发誓说他要报复
<10-17,ROSS>and Enver swore he'd get even

335
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,610
<10-17,ROSS>不达目的决不罢休
<10-17,ROSS>if it was the last thing he'd do.

336
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:16,690
<11-1,BECKETT>恩韦尔·科塔
<11-1,BECKETT>Enver Kotta --

337
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:20,200
<11-1,BECKETT>因持械抢劫  袭击和非法占有被定罪
<11-1,BECKETT>Convictions for armed robbery, assault, and possession.

338
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,430
<11-2,RYAN>根据案件资料
<11-2,RYAN>According to the case file,

339
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:22,970
<11-2,RYAN>罗根的妈妈要么是傻到
<11-2,RYAN>Logan's mom either had the bad sense

340
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:25,760
<11-2,RYAN>让恩韦尔把可卡因藏在她公寓里
<11-2,RYAN>to let Enver stash his cocaine at her apartment

341
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,560
<11-2,RYAN>要么就是她参与了贩毒活动
<11-2,RYAN>or she was in on the whole drug operation.

342
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,330
<11-2,RYAN>总之  罗根看不下去了就报警了
<11-2,RYAN>Bottom line is, Logan got sick of it and called the cops.

343
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:33,380
<11-2,RYAN>罗根的妈妈被判入狱七年
<11-2,RYAN>Logan's mom ended up getting seven years,

344
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,590
<11-2,RYAN>然而恩韦尔只判了五年
<11-2,RYAN>while Enver did five.

345
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:37,390
<11-3,BECKETT>我猜猜  恩韦尔做了个交易  把她坑了
<11-3,BECKETT>Let me guess. Enver cut a deal, threw her under the bus?

346
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:39,080
<11-4,RYAN>是的  另外
<11-4,RYAN>Yep. And guess what else.

347
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,840
<11-4,RYAN>恩韦尔上个月刚刚假释出狱
<11-4,RYAN>Enver just got out on parole last month.

348
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,470
<11-5,CASTLE>当他得知罗根来这儿了
<11-5,CASTLE>So when he realized Logan was in town,

349
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:44,350
<11-5,CASTLE>就去找他算账了
<11-5,CASTLE>he went looking for payback.

350
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:45,930
<11-5,CASTLE>看来
<11-5,CASTLE>Hey, so, it looks like

351
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,850
<11-6,ESPOSITO>罗根肯定和这家伙有联系
<11-6,ESPOSITO>Logan definitely had contact with this guy.

352
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:49,710
<11-6,ESPOSITO>原来恩韦尔是那个
<11-6,ESPOSITO>Turns out that Enver was a regular

353
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,060
<11-6,ESPOSITO>打来电话的俱乐部的常客
<11-6,ESPOSITO>at that social club where the calls came from.

354
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,300
<11-7,BECKETT>好的  把他带来问话
<11-7,BECKETT>Okay. Let's pick him up.

355
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:55,980
<12-1,ENVER KOTTA>不管那孩子发生了什么事  都和我无关
<12-1,ENVER KOTTA>Whatever happened to that kid, I had nothing to do with it.

356
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,910
<12-2,BECKETT>罗根害你坐了五年牢
<12-2,BECKETT>You served five years because of Logan.

357
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:00,340
<12-2,BECKETT>你要找他复仇已经不是什么秘密了
<12-2,BECKETT>It was no secret that you wanted him to pay.

358
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,760
<12-3,ESPOSITO>你就是为这个打给他吗
<12-3,ESPOSITO>Is that why you called him?

359
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,750
<12-3,ESPOSITO>告诉他你要怎么对付他
<12-3,ESPOSITO>To let him know what you were gonna do to him?

360
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,560
<12-4,ENVER>我没有杀罗根
<12-4,ENVER>I didn't kill Logan.

361
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,050
<12-5,BECKETT>那昨晚三点到四点之间你在哪
<12-5,BECKETT>Then where were you last night between 3:00 and 4:00 A.M.?

362
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:10,800
<12-6,ESPOSITO>我来帮你回答吧  恩韦尔
<12-6,ESPOSITO>Let me help you out, Enver.

363
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,110
<12-6,ESPOSITO>你的信用卡显示你1点15分在一家餐馆里
<12-6,ESPOSITO>Your credit card puts you at a diner at 1:15 A.M.,

364
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:16,400
<12-6,ESPOSITO>那里有个目击证人看到你和罗根一起
<12-6,ESPOSITO>where a witness saw you with Logan.

365
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,450
<12-6,ESPOSITO>那个目击证人说罗根离开后
<12-6,ESPOSITO>That same witness said that when Logan left,

366
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,020
<12-6,ESPOSITO>你跟上了他
<12-6,ESPOSITO>you followed him out.

367
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,790
<12-6,ESPOSITO>几个小时后  罗根被杀了
<12-6,ESPOSITO>A few hours later, Logan was dead.

368
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:25,450
<12-7,ENVER>是的  昨晚我见过他
<12-7,ENVER>Okay. I met with him last night.

369
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:27,490
<12-7,ENVER>但我没想要报复
<12-7,ENVER>But I didn't want revenge.

370
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:29,130
<12-8,BECKETT>那你想干什么
<12-8,BECKETT>Then what did you want?

371
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,390
<12-9,ENVER>监狱改变了我
<12-9,ENVER>Prison changed me.

372
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,070
<12-9,ENVER>我皈依了上帝
<12-9,ENVER>I found the lord.

373
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:37,020
<12-9,ENVER>为了完成自我改变
<12-9,ENVER>Working my program means making amends

374
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,950
<12-9,ENVER>我得为之前的错误赎罪
<12-9,ENVER>for the things that I've done wrong.

375
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,240
<12-10,BECKETT>你以为我们会相信
<12-10,BECKETT>Do you expect us to believe

376
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,840
<12-10,BECKETT>你和罗根见面是为了道歉
<12-10,BECKETT>that you met up with Logan to apologize?

377
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:44,410
<12-11,ENVER>他也不相信我
<12-11,ENVER>He didn't believe me, either.

378
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:47,110
<12-11,ENVER>所以我不断地打电话给他
<12-11,ENVER>So I kept calling him and calling him.

379
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:50,240
<12-11,ENVER>昨天他回我电话了  说如果我给他三千
<12-11,ENVER>He phoned back yesterday, said he'd meet me --

380
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,320
<12-11,ENVER>他就肯见我
<12-11,ENVER>if I gave him $3,000.

381
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:54,760
<12-12,ESPOSITO>他为什么要三千块
<12-12,ESPOSITO>Why would he want 3 grand?

382
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,600
<12-12,ESPOSITO>他只说他需要这笔钱
<12-12,ESPOSITO>He just said he needed it.

383
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:59,860
<12-13,ENVER>如果这就是和他面对面的代价
<12-13,ENVER>And if that was the price to sit down with him, Well...

384
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:02,360
<12-13,ENVER>那我愿意付这笔钱
<12-13,ENVER>I was willing to pay it.

385
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:04,880
<12-13,ENVER>所以我凑齐了现金
<12-13,ENVER>So I scraped up the cash.

386
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:06,500
<12-13,ENVER>他肯定到现在还怕我
<12-13,ENVER>He must have still been afraid of me.

387
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,370
<12-13,ENVER>他带了一支枪去了餐馆
<12-13,ENVER>He showed up at the diner with a piece.

388
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,480
<12-13,ENVER>我把钱给他
<12-13,ENVER>I gave him the money,

389
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:14,350
<12-13,ENVER>告诉他我很抱歉将他的生活弄得一团糟
<12-13,ENVER>said how sorry I was for messing up his life,

390
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:17,880
<12-13,ENVER>告诉他我愿为他妈做有利证明
<12-13,ENVER>told him I'd even testify on his mama's behalf,

391
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:20,260
<12-13,ENVER>想让她早点放出来
<12-13,ENVER>try to get her released early.

392
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:22,850
<12-14,BECKETT>那你们俩之后做什么了
<12-14,BECKETT>And what did the two of you do afterwards?

393
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:26,650
<12-15,ENVER>他只说他要趁来得及去处理点事
<12-15,ENVER>He just said he had to take care of something before it was too late.

394
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:28,280
<12-15,ENVER>然后他就离开了
<12-15,ENVER>Then he took off.

395
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:31,070
<12-15,ENVER>而我  就回家了
<12-15,ENVER>And I...went home.

396
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:36,590
<12-15,ENVER>卡塞尔
<12-15,ENVER>Castle.

397
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:38,080
<13-1,RYAN>我有东西要给你
<13-1,RYAN>I, uh, have something for you.

398
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,110
<13-2,CASTLE>-给我  -是的
<13-2,CASTLE>- For me? - Yeah.

399
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:41,190
<13-3,RYAN>肉馅土豆馅饼的配方
<13-3,RYAN>Recipe for shepherd's pie.

400
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,600
<13-4,CASTLE>就是珍妮那天晚上做的那种吗
<13-4,CASTLE>Is this the one Jenny made that night?

401
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,990
<13-4,CASTLE>太好吃了
<13-4,CASTLE>That was outstanding.

402
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:46,910
<13-5,RYAN>-你还记得你问她是怎么做的吗  -是的
<13-5,RYAN>- You remember you asked how she made it? - Yeah.

403
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:49,940
<13-6,CASTLE>这是她祖母家的祖传秘方
<13-6,CASTLE>Well, this is her grandma's secret family recipe --

404
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:52,670
<13-7,RYAN>而我已经把你当成自家人了
<13-7,RYAN>Because I think of you as family.

405
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:54,890
<13-8,CASTLE>谢谢你  莱恩
<13-8,CASTLE>Thank you, Ryan.

406
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,060
<13-8,CASTLE>我太感动了
<13-8,CASTLE>I'm touched.

407
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:58,570
<13-9,RYAN>我永远都会照应你  卡塞尔  别忘了
<13-9,RYAN>Always looking out for you, Castle. Remember that.

408
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:02,580
<13-10,ESPOSITO>罗根住的那个地方的看门人罗斯说
<13-10,ESPOSITO>So, the doorman at Ross' place, where Logan was staying,

409
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:05,120
<13-10,ESPOSITO>罗根昨天晚上一点半回到了住处
<13-10,ESPOSITO>says that Logan came back to the building last night at 1:30 A.M.

410
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,850
<13-11,BECKETT>这说明他在吃完饭后回了家
<13-11,BECKETT>Which means he returned to the building after the diner,

411
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:09,550
<13-11,BECKETT>这就证实了恩韦尔的话
<13-11,BECKETT>and that supports Enver's story.

412
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:11,110
<13-12,ESPOSITO>是的  但是罗根那时还没忙完
<13-12,ESPOSITO>Yeah, but Logan wasn't done for the night.

413
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:11,980
<13-12,ESPOSITO>他是回去拿东西的
<13-12,ESPOSITO>He was picking something up.

414
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,570
<13-12,ESPOSITO>看门人说他只进去了一小会儿
<13-12,ESPOSITO>Doorman says that he went inside for a sec,

415
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,180
<13-12,ESPOSITO>然后就拿着个黑色行李包出来了
<13-12,ESPOSITO>came back out carrying a black duffel bag.

416
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,140
<13-12,ESPOSITO>行李包
<13-12,ESPOSITO>A duffel bag?

417
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,800
<13-13,BECKETT>看门人知道里面是什么吗
<13-13,BECKETT>Could the doorman tell what was inside?

418
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,700
<13-14,ESPOSITO>不知道  但是他看出那包很重
<13-14,ESPOSITO>No, but he said it was heavy,

419
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:19,880
<13-14,ESPOSITO>所以他想帮罗根叫辆出租车
<13-14,ESPOSITO>so he offered to hail a cab.

420
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,090
<13-14,ESPOSITO>罗根拒绝了  然后跳上滑板就走了
<13-14,ESPOSITO>Logan refused and jumped on his skateboard and rolled away.

421
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:23,920
<13-15,CASTLE>犯罪现场没有什么行李包
<13-15,CASTLE>There was no duffel bag at the scene.

422
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,100
<13-16,RYAN>可能凶手拿走了
<13-16,RYAN>Maybe the killer took it.

423
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:27,930
<13-17,BECKETT>派警员去罗斯住处和犯罪现场之间的区域搜寻
<13-17,BECKETT>Canvass the area between Ross' building and our crime scene.

424
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:31,130
<13-17,BECKETT>如果我们能知道罗根要把那包带去哪
<13-17,BECKETT>If we can figure out where Logan was taking that bag,

425
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,980
<13-17,BECKETT>应该就能找到凶手了
<13-17,BECKETT>that should lead us to our killer.

426
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:33,860
<13-18,ESPOSITO>我们马上去查
<13-18,ESPOSITO>We'll get into it.

427
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,030
<13-19,CASTLE>可以回家了吗
<13-19,CASTLE>You ready to go home?

428
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:38,030
<13-20,BECKETT>是的  我也真有点累了
<13-20,BECKETT>Yeah. Yeah, I am. I'm actually kind of tired.

429
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:41,190
<13-21,CASTLE>我希望你不是很累  还能...
<13-21,CASTLE>I hope not too tired to...you know.

430
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,980
<14-1,CASTLE>D拼Dyad[二分体]
<14-1,CASTLE>And "D" for "Dyad,"

431
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:51,390
<14-1,CASTLE>是指两个人谈话  就像我们现在这样
<14-1,CASTLE>which means two people talking, as we are now.

432
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:53,420
<14-2,BECKETT>实际上  大部分时间都是你在说
<14-2,BECKETT>Well, actually, it's been mostly you talking.

433
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,650
<14-2,BECKETT>或者更准确地说  是在吹牛
<14-2,BECKETT>Well, bragging, to be specific.

434
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:57,880
<14-3,CASTLE>好了  单词得9分
<14-3,CASTLE>Okay, word score's a 9,

435
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:00,710
<14-3,CASTLE>而且有双倍得分  就是18分
<14-3,CASTLE>plus the double word score brings it to 18,

436
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:03,130
<14-3,CASTLE>加上A和Y的5分
<14-3,CASTLE>plus the 5 from the "A" "Y",

437
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:04,080
<14-3,CASTLE>总共是23分
<14-3,CASTLE>that's a total of 23,

438
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:07,210
<14-3,CASTLE>所以我的总分是312分
<14-3,CASTLE>bringing my score to 312,

439
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:09,310
<14-3,CASTLE>而你只有区区的175分
<14-3,CASTLE>versus your paltry 175.

440
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,530
<14-4,BECKETT>卡塞尔  难道没有比获胜更重要的事了吗
<14-4,BECKETT>Castle, aren't there more important things than winning?

441
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:15,850
<14-5,CASTLE>这句话是用来安慰输了的人的
<14-5,CASTLE>That's a notion created to comfort those who lose.

442
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:19,460
<14-6,BECKETT>我是在想我们可以做一些
<14-6,BECKETT>Well, I was thinking that we could be doing

443
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:21,780
<14-6,BECKETT>更有趣的事
<14-6,BECKETT>something more interesting with our time.

444
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,030
<14-7,CASTLE>这样的话
<14-7,CASTLE>Well, in that case,

445
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,970
<14-7,CASTLE>那我们就赶紧结束这场比赛吧
<14-7,CASTLE>let's hurry up and finish this game.

446
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,240
<14-8,BECKETT>好吧  那我认输怎么样
<14-8,BECKETT>Okay. How about I concede?

447
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,200
<14-9,CASTLE>剥夺我胜利的快感吗
<14-9,CASTLE>And steal my moment of triumph?

448
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,460
<14-9,CASTLE>不行  不是真正获胜就不算数
<14-9,CASTLE>No. It doesn't count if it's not official.

449
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:34,780
<14-9,CASTLE>现在该你下了  感受一下失败的痛苦吧
<14-9,CASTLE>Now, just take your turn and feel the bitter sting of defeat.

450
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:36,460
<14-10,BECKETT>好吧
<14-10,BECKETT>Fine.

451
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:53,440
<14-11,CASTLE>Quixotic[不切实际的]
<14-11,CASTLE>"Quixotic"?

452
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,430
<14-11,CASTLE>是的
<14-11,CASTLE>Yeah.

453
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:58,310
<14-12,BECKETT>这个词含有字母Q和C  可以三倍得分
<14-12,BECKETT>So, that's a triple word score with the "Q" And the "C,"

454
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:00,250
<14-12,BECKETT>以及含有字母X  可以双倍得分
<14-12,BECKETT>plus a double letter score with the "X"

455
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:03,460
<14-12,BECKETT>还有对我用完所有字母的50分额外奖励
<14-12,BECKETT>and another 50-point bonus for using all of my letters.

456
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,060
<14-12,BECKETT>一共多少分
<14-12,BECKETT>How many points is that?

457
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,440
<14-13,CASTLE>314分
<14-13,CASTLE>314.

458
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,140
<14-14,BECKETT>抱歉  卡塞尔
<14-14,BECKETT>I'm sorry, Castle.

459
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,910
<14-15,CASTLE>我想我要一个人待会儿
<14-15,CASTLE>I think I need to be alone.

460
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,970
<15-1,RYAN>好的  有新消息通知我  谢了  比尔
<15-1,RYAN>All right. Keep me posted. All right. Thanks, Bill.

461
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:37,300
<15-2,ESPOSITO>伙计  我一直在想
<15-2,ESPOSITO>Hey, man. I've been thinking.

462
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,790
<15-2,ESPOSITO>卡塞尔对我们两个都很喜欢
<15-2,ESPOSITO>You know, Castle likes us both too much

463
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:41,490
<15-2,ESPOSITO>所以很难选出谁当伴郎
<15-2,ESPOSITO>to have to make the pick for best man.

464
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:43,520
<15-2,ESPOSITO>我们应该替他来决定
<15-2,ESPOSITO>So we should make the decision for him.

465
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:45,950
<15-3,RYAN>这是他的婚礼啊
<15-3,RYAN>Um... it's his wedding.

466
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:47,610
<15-3,RYAN>我们怎么能替他做决定
<15-3,RYAN>How do you propose we decide for him?

467
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,800
<15-4,ESPOSITO>我们其中一个人要退出
<15-4,ESPOSITO>One of us is gonna have to drop out.

468
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,580
<15-4,ESPOSITO>"其中一个人"就是指"你"
<15-4,ESPOSITO>And by "One of us," I mean "You."

469
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,060
<15-5,RYAN>我
<15-5,RYAN>Me?

470
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:57,750
<15-5,RYAN>为什么是我
<15-5,RYAN>Why should it be me?

471
00:18:58,210 --> 00:18:59,430
<15-5,RYAN>因为
<15-5,RYAN>Because.

472
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:00,600
<15-6,ESPOSITO>你觉得理查德·卡塞尔
<15-6,ESPOSITO>You think Richard Castle

473
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,160
<15-6,ESPOSITO>会想让你来策划他的单身汉舞会吗  傻兄弟
<15-6,ESPOSITO>wants you planning his bachelor party? Come on, bro.

474
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:04,570
<15-7,RYAN>埃斯波西托
<15-7,RYAN>Oh, Esposito.

475
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:06,010
<15-7,RYAN>做伴郎可不仅仅是要
<15-7,RYAN>See, being a best man is a lot more

476
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:08,200
<15-7,RYAN>策划单身汉舞会
<15-7,RYAN>than just preparing the bachelor party.

477
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,550
<15-7,RYAN>我是有家室的人
<15-7,RYAN>I'm a family man.

478
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:11,300
<15-7,RYAN>我代表了更高的道德水准
<15-7,RYAN>I represent a high moral standing.

479
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,200
<15-8,ESPOSITO>得了吧
<15-8,ESPOSITO>Oh, please.

480
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,820
<15-9,RYAN>而且我的摄影技术比你高
<15-9,RYAN>And I photograph better than you.

481
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:14,610
<15-9,RYAN>什么
<15-9,RYAN>What?

482
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,470
<15-10,ESPOSITO>我告诉你吧  你要完了
<15-10,ESPOSITO>Let me tell you something -- you're going down.

483
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:21,100
<15-10,ESPOSITO>你给我记好了  我可是给你台阶下了
<15-10,ESPOSITO>And just remember that I gave you an opportunity to bow out gracefully.

484
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,070
<15-10,ESPOSITO>听见了吗
<15-10,ESPOSITO>You hear me?

485
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:23,220
<15-11,RYAN>是的
<15-11,RYAN>Okay.

486
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,110
<15-12,ESPOSITO>卡塞尔  哥们  怎么样了
<15-12,ESPOSITO>Castle. Hey, buddy. How's it going?

487
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,160
<15-13,CASTLE>别问
<15-13,CASTLE>Don't ask.

488
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:30,940
<15-14,ESPOSITO>作为你最好的朋友  我不得不问
<15-14,ESPOSITO>Well, as your close friend, now I have to ask.

489
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,340
<15-15,RYAN>她是不是又赢了拼字游戏
<15-15,RYAN>did she beat you at scrabble again?

490
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:33,920
<15-16,CASTLE>拜托  我们能不能谈谈案子
<15-16,CASTLE>Can we just talk about the case, please?

491
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:35,600
<15-18,ESPOSITO>当然
<15-18,ESPOSITO>Sure. You bet.

492
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,530
<15-19,ESPOSITO>去调查罗根
<15-19,ESPOSITO>So, the canvass to narrow down

493
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:39,750
<15-19,ESPOSITO>把行李包带去了哪的警员一无所获
<15-19,ESPOSITO>where Logan went with his duffel last night came up empty.

494
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,980
<15-20,RYAN>但是  还记得我们在他身上找到的钥匙吗
<15-20,RYAN>But, uh, you remember the key that we found on him?

495
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,390
<15-20,RYAN>鉴证组发现它属于一家24小时营业的健身房
<15-20,RYAN>Well, CSU, they traced it back to a 24-hour gym,

496
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:45,940
<15-20,RYAN>而且罗根在他遇害当晚
<15-20,RYAN>and it turns out that Logan was there

497
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:48,910
<15-20,RYAN>3点至4点就在那里
<15-20,RYAN>3:00 and 4:00 A.M. the night he was murdered.

498
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:51,010
<15-21,CASTLE>这么说他临死前去的最后一个地方是健身房
<15-21,CASTLE>So the last place he went before he was killed was a gym.

499
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:52,250
<15-22,ESPOSITO>而且他待的时间不长
<15-22,ESPOSITO>And he didn't stay long.

500
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,810
<15-22,ESPOSITO>他的会员卡刷进
<15-22,ESPOSITO>His membership card was swiped in

501
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:56,220
<15-22,ESPOSITO>和刷出只相差了两分钟
<15-22,ESPOSITO>and then swiped right back out two minutes later.

502
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,210
<15-23,BECKETT>放下行李包的时间是足够了
<15-23,BECKETT>Just long enough to drop off a duffel bag.

503
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,270
<16-1,GYM CLERK>是的  我对罗根印象很深
<16-1,GYM CLERK>Yeah, I totally remember Logan.

504
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,260
<16-1,GYM CLERK>他每天去石墙那边
<16-1,GYM CLERK>He was in here every day on the rock wall,

505
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,490
<16-1,GYM CLERK>练习攀岩
<16-1,GYM CLERK>Practicing his climbing.

506
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:08,980
<16-1,GYM CLERK>这是他的更衣柜
<16-1,GYM CLERK>This is his locker.

507
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:10,720
<16-2,BECKETT>两天前的晚上你看到他来过吗
<16-2,BECKETT>Did you see him come in two nights ago?

508
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,240
<16-3,GYM CLERK>那晚我不工作  但是我们有监控录像
<16-3,GYM CLERK>I wasn't on duty, but we have security video.

509
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,560
<16-3,GYM CLERK>我想我能给你们一份
<16-3,GYM CLERK>I'm sure I can get you a copy.

510
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,640
<16-4,BECKETT>卡塞尔  在这里
<16-4,BECKETT>Castle, it's here.

511
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,450
<16-5,BECKETT>看看
<16-5,BECKETT>Look at this.

512
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:24,600
<16-6,CASTLE>攀岩装备
<16-6,CASTLE>Climbing gear?

513
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,440
<16-6,CASTLE>是的
<16-6,CASTLE>Yeah.

514
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,150
<16-7,BECKETT>和一把点45口径手枪
<16-7,BECKETT>And a .45.

515
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,010
<16-7,BECKETT>一定是罗根从汤米·弗顿那偷的那把
<16-7,BECKETT>This must be the one that Logan stole from Tommy Fulton.

516
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,990
<16-8,CASTLE>可他那晚为什么需要手枪和攀岩绳呢
<16-8,CASTLE>But why would he need a gun and climbing ropes that night?

517
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:41,710
<16-9,BECKETT>螺丝刀  扳手
<16-9,BECKETT>Screwdrivers, wrenches.

518
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:43,120
<16-10,CASTLE>那个应该是玻璃刀
<16-10,CASTLE>And that would be a glass cutter.

519
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,450
<16-11,BECKETT>还有开锁工具
<16-11,BECKETT>And tension tools...

520
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:48,520
<16-11,BECKETT>撬锁用的
<16-11,BECKETT>For picking locks.

521
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:51,790
<16-12,CASTLE>罗根·摩尔不是简单的滑板冠军
<16-12,CASTLE>So, Logan Moore wasn't just a champion skateboarder.

522
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,180
<16-12,CASTLE>他是个小偷
<16-12,CASTLE>He was a thief.

523
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:01,370
<17-1,CASTLE>罗根·摩尔的家庭充满不幸
<17-1,CASTLE>Logan Moore, child of a broken home

524
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:04,110
<17-1,CASTLE>他在滑板中找到了慰藉和乐趣所在
<17-1,CASTLE>who found solace and salvation on a skateboard.

525
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:07,610
<17-1,CASTLE>但他有没有利用极限运动好手的身体条件
<17-1,CASTLE>But did he use his skills as an extreme athlete

526
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:08,980
<17-1,CASTLE>成为了一名神偷呢
<17-1,CASTLE>to become a master thief?

527
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:12,680
<17-1,CASTLE>这位不羁的滑板手是否真的成了法外之徒
<17-1,CASTLE>Did our outlaw skater become an actual outlaw?

528
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,780
<17-2,BECKETT>若他是个小偷  那他到底偷了什么
<17-2,BECKETT>If he was a thief, then what did he steal?

529
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,160
<17-2,BECKETT>在他身上和储物柜里
<17-2,BECKETT>We didn't find anything of value

530
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,470
<17-2,BECKETT>没有发现任何贵重物品
<17-2,BECKETT>in his locker or on his body.

531
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:19,620
<17-2,BECKETT>也许是被凶手拿走了
<17-2,BECKETT>Well, maybe the killer took it.

532
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,000
<17-3,CASTLE>也许这是他被害的原因
<17-3,CASTLE>Maybe that's why he targeted Logan.

533
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:24,180
<17-4,RYAN>鉴证组正在处理那个健身房包
<17-4,RYAN>So, while CSU was processing that gym bag,

534
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:26,400
<17-4,RYAN>他们找到一张他死亡那天的收据
<17-4,RYAN>they found this receipt inside from the day he died.

535
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:27,940
<17-5,BECKETT>电子商品店的收据
<17-5,BECKETT>From an electronics store?

536
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:28,740
<17-6,RYAN>是的  店在中城区
<17-6,RYAN>Yeah, in midtown.

537
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,510
<17-6,RYAN>店主说他记得罗根
<17-6,RYAN>The owner there said he remembered Logan

538
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:33,030
<17-6,RYAN>因为他想买一个超8摄像机
<17-6,RYAN>because he asked for a Hi8 camcorder.

539
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:35,030
<17-7,CASTLE>超8  这种格式已经过时了
<17-7,CASTLE>Hi8? That's an outdated format.

540
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:37,250
<17-8,RYAN>是的  他卖出的那台已有10年历史了
<17-8,RYAN>Sure is. The one he sold him was 10 years old.

541
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,580
<17-9,CASTLE>那他为什么要买一台10年前的摄像机呢
<17-9,CASTLE>So, why would he buy a 10-year-old camcorder?

542
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,570
<17-10,BECKETT>也许他想拍下他的犯罪过程
<17-10,BECKETT>Maybe he wanted to film his crime?

544
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,880
<17-11,CASTLE>为什么不用手机或者GoPro呢
<17-11,CASTLE>Why not use a cellphone or a GoPro?

545
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:46,560
<17-12,ESPOSITO>伙计们  过来看看这个
<17-12,ESPOSITO>Hey, guys. Come check this out.

546
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:48,230
<17-12,ESPOSITO>多谢
<17-12,ESPOSITO>Thanks.

547
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:52,740
<18-1,ESPOSITO>我们查看了健身房的监控记录
<18-1,ESPOSITO>So, we ran through security footage of the gym

548
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,030
<18-1,ESPOSITO>想看看罗根寄存包的时候
<18-1,ESPOSITO>to see if anybody was with Logan

549
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:56,220
<18-1,ESPOSITO>是否有人和他一起  或者被跟踪
<18-1,ESPOSITO>when he dropped off the bag or if anyone followed him out.

550
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,160
<18-2,TORY ELLIS>这是我们的发现
<18-2,TORY ELLIS>Here's what we found.

551
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,410
<18-2,TORY ELLIS>这些监控记录的截图
<18-2,TORY ELLIS>These photograbs correspond to the exact time

552
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:02,100
<18-2,TORY ELLIS>是在罗根刷门卡时截取的
<18-2,TORY ELLIS>Logan's card was swiped.

553
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:06,470
<18-3,BECKETT>等等  那不是罗根
<18-3,BECKETT>Wait a minute. That's not Logan.

554
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:08,010
<18-4,CASTLE>不是  不过我们之前见过他
<18-4,CASTLE>No, but we've seen him before.

555
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,700
<18-5,BECKETT>是的  在罗斯·迪·科宁阁楼派对上
<18-5,BECKETT>Yeah, at Ross De Koning's penthouse party.

556
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,890
<18-6,ESPOSITO>他连帽衫下面穿着街头运动的T恤
<18-6,ESPOSITO>And he's wearing a street sports tee underneath his hoodie,

557
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:14,220
<18-6,ESPOSITO>于是我们查了他们的网站
<18-6,ESPOSITO>so we checked out their website.

558
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:16,980
<18-7,TORY>他的名字是卡特·维斯兰德
<18-7,TORY>His name is Carter Wexland.

559
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,210
<18-7,TORY>他也是参赛选手之一
<18-7,TORY>He's one of the competitors,

560
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:19,750
<18-7,TORY>罗根肯定也认识他
<18-7,TORY>so Logan would have known him.

561
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:20,490
<18-8,ESPOSITO>我查了他的档案
<18-8,ESPOSITO>Pulled his file.

562
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:22,870
<18-8,ESPOSITO>他有非法闯入和重偷窃罪的犯罪记录
<18-8,ESPOSITO>He has a record for B&Es and grand theft.

563
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:23,670
<18-8,ESPOSITO>而且
<18-8,ESPOSITO>And...

564
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:26,290
<18-8,ESPOSITO>他还是一名越野摩托车手
<18-8,ESPOSITO>He's also a motocross rider.

565
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,680
<18-9,BECKETT>正如此案的凶手
<18-9,BECKETT>Just like our killer.

566
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:38,190
<19-1,CARTER WEXLAND>我去了健身房  那又怎样
<19-1,CARTER WEXLAND>So, I went to the gym. So what?

567
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,680
<19-2,ESPOSITO>在凌晨3点40分去的
<19-2,ESPOSITO>At 03:40 A.M.

568
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,800
<19-3,CARTER>我睡不着
<19-3,CARTER>I couldn't sleep.

569
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,790
<19-3,CARTER>没什么大不了的
<19-3,CARTER>What's the big deal?

570
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:43,290
<19-4,BECKETT>问题大着呢  卡特·维斯兰德先生
<19-4,BECKETT>The big deal, Mr. Wexland,

571
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:45,510
<19-4,BECKETT>你用罗根·摩尔的健身卡的时候
<19-4,BECKETT>is that you used Logan Moore's I.D. Card

572
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:47,790
<19-4,BECKETT>正是他在那附近被人杀害的时候
<19-4,BECKETT>when he had just been killed nearby.

573
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,350
<19-5,ESPOSITO>不难想象你是从哪里弄到的健身卡
<19-5,ESPOSITO>Ain't hard to figure out where you got it.

574
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:52,340
<19-6,CARTER>他前一天借给我的  这样我才能健身
<19-6,CARTER>Yeah. He loaned it to me the day before so I could work out.

575
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,430
<19-7,BECKETT>你健身的时间真短
<19-7,BECKETT>That was a quick workout,

576
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:56,060
<19-7,BECKETT>你进去出来一共就花了两分钟
<19-7,BECKETT>considering you were there for only two minutes.

577
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:59,210
<19-7,BECKETT>你进去是为了寄放那个旅行包
<19-7,BECKETT>You went there to drop off this duffel bag.

578
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:01,620
<19-7,BECKETT>罗根在那晚早些时候也带着同样的包
<19-7,BECKETT>And since Logan was carrying this exact bag

579
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:04,640
<19-7,BECKETT>我们相信你们俩一定见过面
<19-7,BECKETT>earlier that night, we know the two of you crossed paths.

580
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,270
<19-8,ESPOSITO>我真希望你能看到你自己的表情
<19-8,ESPOSITO>I wish you could see your face right now.

581
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,270
<19-8,ESPOSITO>就像霓虹灯一样闪烁着"是我干的"
<19-8,ESPOSITO>It's like this neon sign flashing "I did it!"

582
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:10,420
<20-1,RYAN>情况如何
<20-1,RYAN>How's it going?

583
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:12,210
<20-2,CASTLE>他快顶不住压力了
<20-2,CASTLE>They got him on the run.

584
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,710
<20-3,RYAN>我想你肯定要点提神饮料
<20-3,RYAN>I, uh, thought you could use a little pick-me-up.

585
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:18,200
<20-4,CASTLE>多谢
<20-4,CASTLE>Thanks. Uh-huh.

586
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:20,090
<20-5,RYAN>朋友就应该互相照顾不是吗
<20-5,RYAN>That's what friends are for, right?

587
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:21,870
<20-6,CASTLE>是的
<20-6,CASTLE>Right. Mm-hmm.

588
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:24,820
<20-7,RYAN>婚礼计划得怎么样了
<20-7,RYAN>Oh, hey, uh, how are the wedding plans going?

589
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:25,700
<20-7,RYAN>都还顺利吗
<20-7,RYAN>Everything good?

590
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:27,900
<20-8,CASTLE>顺利  都很好
<20-8,CASTLE>Yeah. Yeah, great.

591
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:28,670
<20-8,CASTLE>不错
<20-8,CASTLE>Great.

592
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:31,980
<20-9,RYAN>如果有什么事情我能帮忙的话
<20-9,RYAN>Well, if there's anything I-I can do to help --

593
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,630
<20-9,RYAN>随便什么脏活累活
<20-9,RYAN>You know, literally, symbolically --

594
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:35,080
<20-9,RYAN>只管说
<20-9,RYAN>Just...let me know.

595
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:37,880
<20-10,CASTLE>好的
<20-10,CASTLE>I will.

596
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:56,830
<20-10,CASTLE>到底发生了什么  伙计
<20-10,CASTLE>So, what happened, bro?

597
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,880
<20-11,ESPOSITO>你们俩合伙干了一票
<20-11,ESPOSITO>The two of you did a job together?

598
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,110
<20-11,ESPOSITO>结果意见不合吵起来了
<20-11,ESPOSITO>And you had a falling-out,

599
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:02,040
<20-11,ESPOSITO>于是你决定你要独吞战果
<20-11,ESPOSITO>then you decided you didn't want to share the score?

600
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,700
<21-1,CARTER>伙计  听我说  我没有杀人
<21-1,CARTER>Dude, I'm telling you -- I didn't kill anyone.

601
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:06,890
<21-2,BECKETT>拜托  卡特  你有他的包和健身卡
<21-2,BECKETT>Come on, Carter. You had his bag and his I.D. on you.

602
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:08,760
<21-2,BECKETT>你距他被杀的地方就几个街区远
<21-2,BECKETT>You were blocks away from where he was killed,

603
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,680
<21-2,BECKETT>你也是个越野摩托车手
<21-2,BECKETT>And you ride a motocross bike.

604
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,720
<21-2,BECKETT>再加上你的犯罪记录
<21-2,BECKETT>With your criminal record,

605
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,720
<21-2,BECKETT>检察官判你有罪想都不用想
<21-2,BECKETT>this is gonna be a slam dunk for the D.A.

606
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,980
<21-3,CARTER>不  不  听我说
<21-3,CARTER>No, no. I'm telling you.

607
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:17,460
<21-3,CARTER>那晚我最后一次见到罗根时  他还活着
<21-3,CARTER>The last time I saw Logan that night, he was still alive.

608
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,890
<21-4,BECKETT>你终于承认你见过他了
<21-4,BECKETT>So you admit to having seen him.

609
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,170
<21-5,CARTER>是的
<21-5,CARTER>Yes.

610
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:22,820
<21-6,BECKETT>好的
<21-6,BECKETT>Okay.

611
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:25,720
<21-7,CARTER>他听说了我的过去于是雇我帮他做事
<21-7,CARTER>He heard about my past and hired me for a job.

612
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,190
<21-8,BECKETT>做什么
<21-8,BECKETT>Okay. So, what was the job.

613
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,380
<21-9,CARTER>非法闯入
<21-9,CARTER>A B&E.

614
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,820
<21-9,CARTER>他承诺若我能解除报警系统就给我三千块
<21-9,CARTER>He told me he'd give me 3 grand to bypass an alarm system

615
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,380
<21-9,CARTER>还让我在房顶帮他栓好绳索
<21-9,CARTER>and belay him from a rooftop

616
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,700
<21-9,CARTER>这样他就能潜入一个位于15楼的办公室
<21-9,CARTER>so that he could get into a 15th-floor office.

617
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:38,520
<21-10,ESPOSITO>什么办公室
<21-10,ESPOSITO>What office?

618
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:40,650
<21-11,CARTER>我不知道  我那会儿在房顶
<21-11,CARTER>I don't know. I was on the roof.

619
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:42,840
<21-11,CARTER>他切开窗户玻璃之后进去了
<21-11,CARTER>He cut in through the window, went in,

620
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:44,320
<21-11,CARTER>然后把装备装在包里送了上来
<21-11,CARTER>and then sent up the gear with the bag.

621
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:45,790
<21-11,CARTER>那是我最后一次见到他
<21-11,CARTER>That was the last I saw him.

622
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:48,050
<21-11,CARTER>计划是我要带着那些装备离开现场
<21-11,CARTER>The plan was for me to disappear with the gear

623
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:50,520
<21-11,CARTER>然后把包存放在健身房
<21-11,CARTER>and then stash the bag at the gym.

624
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:52,190
<21-12,BECKETT>他有带一个摄像机吗
<21-12,BECKETT>Did he have a camcorder with him?

625
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,370
<21-12,BECKETT>有
<21-12,BECKETT>Yeah.

626
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,310
<21-13,CARTER>之前包里有一个
<21-13,CARTER>I-I mean, there was one in the bag.

627
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,060
<21-13,CARTER>不过他把送上来之后就不在了
<21-13,CARTER>But it wasn't there when he sent it back.

628
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:58,680
<21-14,ESPOSITO>他跟你说他在找什么了吗
<21-14,ESPOSITO>Did he tell you what he was after?

629
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,540
<21-14,ESPOSITO>没有
<21-14,ESPOSITO>No.

630
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:03,520
<21-15,CARTER>不过当我知道要这么麻烦时
<21-15,CARTER>But when I saw all the trouble that we were going to,

631
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:04,990
<21-15,CARTER>我跟罗根说我要提成
<21-15,CARTER>I told Logan I wanted a cut,

632
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:06,280
<21-15,CARTER>而不仅仅是三千块
<21-15,CARTER>not just the 3 grand.

633
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:07,610
<21-15,CARTER>他听了很生气
<21-15,CARTER>He got really pissed

634
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:08,850
<21-15,CARTER>说他可不是什么罪犯
<21-15,CARTER>and said he wasn't some criminal

635
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:10,350
<21-15,CARTER>这也不是有关钱的事
<21-15,CARTER>and this wasn't about money.

636
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:12,980
<21-15,CARTER>是替一个死去的朋友讨回公道
<21-15,CARTER>It was about making things right for a friend who died.

637
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,830
<21-15,CARTER>他当时很激动
<21-15,CARTER>He was really intense.

638
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:16,380
<21-15,CARTER>我就相信了他
<21-15,CARTER>I believed him.

639
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:19,540
<21-16,BECKETT>罗根跟你说是他哪个朋友了吗
<21-16,BECKETT>Did Logan tell you who this friend was?

640
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:23,360
<21-17,CARTER>不  他没说
<21-17,CARTER>No. He didn't.

641
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:28,190
<22-1,CASTLE>提前把工具邮过来  雇佣帮手
<22-1,CASTLE>Shipping his tools ahead, hiring an accomplice --

642
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:30,780
<22-1,CASTLE>同时利用一个滑板活动做掩护
<22-1,CASTLE>All the while using a skateboarding event as a cover.

643
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,900
<22-1,CASTLE>在我看来罗根回到纽约的真正原因
<22-1,CASTLE>Seems to me the real reason Logan came back to New York

644
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:33,970
<22-1,CASTLE>就是来行窃
<22-1,CASTLE>was to commit this burglary.

645
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:35,060
<22-2,BECKETT>但他到底要偷什么
<22-2,BECKETT>Yeah, but what was he stealing,

646
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:37,630
<22-2,BECKETT>这和他这位去世的朋友又有什么联系
<22-2,BECKETT>and how is it related to this dead friend?

647
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,290
<22-3,ESPOSITO>那我再去问问认识罗根的人
<22-3,ESPOSITO>Well, I'll circle back around to the people who knew Logan,

648
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:42,950
<22-3,ESPOSITO>看他们对闯入知不知情  认不认识这个死去的朋友
<22-3,ESPOSITO>see if anybody knows of any break-ins or a dead friend.

649
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:44,580
<22-3,ESPOSITO>对了  卡塞尔
<22-3,ESPOSITO>Oh, and, Castle,

650
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:46,550
<22-3,ESPOSITO>你想不想和我一起去趟滑板公园
<22-3,ESPOSITO>do you want to come with me down to the skate park?

651
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:47,620
<22-3,ESPOSITO>我们可以顺便
<22-3,ESPOSITO>I thought maybe we could stop by

652
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,790
<22-3,ESPOSITO>去吃你喜欢的培根布朗尼
<22-3,ESPOSITO>and get some of those bacon brownies that you love.

653
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:51,050
<22-4,CASTLE>有培根我当然去
<22-4,CASTLE>You had me at bacon.

654
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,120
<22-5,RYAN>你最好先别急着答应
<22-5,RYAN>Uh, well, you might want to hold off on that offer.

655
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:55,630
<22-5,RYAN>卡特和罗根闯入的那栋大楼
<22-5,RYAN>That building that Carter and Logan broke into

656
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:58,050
<22-5,RYAN>离罗根被害地点只有几个街区
<22-5,RYAN>was only a few blocks from where Logan was killed.

657
00:25:58,050 --> 00:25:59,580
<22-5,RYAN>但我查过出警记录
<22-5,RYAN>Yet I checked the police blotter.

658
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,930
<22-5,RYAN>当晚那附近没有接到任何闯入的报警
<22-5,RYAN>There were no reported break-ins there that evening.

659
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:03,410
<22-5,RYAN>根据卡特的描述
<22-5,RYAN>But based on Carter's description,

660
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:06,120
<22-5,RYAN>我查到了罗根破窗而入的15楼的
<22-5,RYAN>I was able to identify which 15th-floor window

661
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,790
<22-5,RYAN>所有者是谁了
<22-5,RYAN>that Logan entered through.

662
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:10,760
<22-5,RYAN>该层是一家属于布伦特·扎列特茨基的律师事务所
<22-5,RYAN>It belongs to a law office for a Brett Zaretsky, esquire.

663
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,460
<22-6,BECKETT>罗根闯入律师事务所做什么
<22-6,BECKETT>What was Logan doing breaking into a law office?

664
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,350
<22-7,RYAN>你们最好去查一查
<22-7,RYAN>You guys should probably go find out.

665
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,900
<22-8,BECKETT>好  来吧卡塞尔  我们走
<22-8,BECKETT>Yeah. Come on, Castle. Let's go.

666
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:18,600
<22-9,CASTLE>改天再吃
<22-9,CASTLE>Rain check?

667
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:19,450
<22-9,CASTLE>好呀
<22-9,CASTLE>Yeah.

668
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:30,230
<23-1,CASTLE>你没觉得埃斯波西托和莱恩最近有点古怪吗
<23-1,CASTLE>Have you noticed anything odd about Esposito and Ryan lately?

669
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,050
<23-2,BECKETT>比如
<23-2,BECKETT>Like what?

670
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:33,210
<23-3,CASTLE>他们对我特别好  好得让人发毛
<23-3,CASTLE>They're being nice to me -- weird nice.

671
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:35,220
<23-4,BECKETT>他俩大概是想抚慰一下你那
<23-4,BECKETT>Well, they probably just feel sorry for you

672
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:37,640
<23-4,BECKETT>被我昨晚打得满地找牙的脆弱心灵吧
<23-4,BECKETT>after the beatdown I gave you in scrabble last night.

673
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,850
<23-5,CASTLE>你莫要得意  我此仇必报
<23-5,CASTLE>Gloat all you want. I will have my revenge.

674
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:42,140
<23-6,BECKETT>好了  我们去找布伦特·扎列特茨基吧
<23-6,BECKETT>Okay. Okay. Let's just find Brett Zaretsky right now.

675
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:45,160
<23-7,CASTLE>新窗玻璃
<23-7,CASTLE>New window.

676
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,020
<23-7,CASTLE>两位有何贵干
<23-7,CASTLE>Can I help you?

677
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:49,380
<23-7,CASTLE>你好  我们是来调查闯入案的
<23-7,CASTLE>Yeah. Hi. We're here about the break-in.

678
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:52,320
<24-1,BRETT ZARETSKY>恐怕二位搞错了
<24-1,BRETT ZARETSKY>Well, I'm afraid you've been misinformed.

679
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:56,370
<24-2,CASTLE>没人破窗闯入你的办公室吗  扎列特茨基先生
<24-2,CASTLE>A thief didn't break in through your window, mr. Zaretsky?

680
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:57,250
<24-3,ZARETSKY>没有
<24-3,ZARETSKY>No.

681
00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:00,240
<24-4,BECKETT>那为什么要换窗玻璃
<24-4,BECKETT>Well, why is the glass being replaced?

682
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:02,800
<24-5,ZARETSKY>被小鸟撞坏了
<24-5,ZARETSKY>A small mishap with a bird.

683
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:05,450
<24-6,CASTLE>小鸟
<24-6,CASTLE>A bird?

684
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:10,280
<24-7,BECKETT>扎列特茨基先生  你认识这个人吗
<24-7,BECKETT>Mr. Zaretsky, do you recognize this man?

685
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:13,280
<24-8,ZARETSKY>抱歉  我没什么印象
<24-8,ZARETSKY>No. I'm sorry. I'm afraid I don't.

686
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,370
<24-9,BECKETT>你介不介意我们四处查看一下
<24-9,BECKETT>Would you mind if we took a quick look around?

687
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:17,190
<24-10,CASTLE>是啊  我们没准能帮你
<24-10,CASTLE>Yeah, we might be able to help you

688
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:19,550
<24-10,CASTLE>评估一下那小鸟给你造成的损失呢
<24-10,CASTLE>assess any of the damage this bird might have caused.

689
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:22,530
<24-11,ZARETSKY>我很介意
<24-11,ZARETSKY>Yes, I mind.

690
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:25,590
<24-12,BECKETT>扎列特茨基先生  前天晚上你或者其他人
<24-12,BECKETT>Mr. Zaretsky, were you or anyone else here

691
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:26,630
<24-12,BECKETT>是否来过这间办公室
<24-12,BECKETT>two nights ago?

692
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:29,390
<24-13,ZARETSKY>探长  你得先传唤我才能讯问我
<24-13,ZARETSKY>Detective, if you want to question me, get a subpoena.

693
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:31,470
<24-13,ZARETSKY>想来事务所查案  先申请搜查令
<24-13,ZARETSKY>If you want to come into these offices, get a warrant.

694
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:33,950
<24-13,ZARETSKY>在那之前  我只好请两位离开
<24-13,ZARETSKY>Until then, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

695
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,700
<25-1,BECKETT>那律师拒绝配合我们
<25-1,BECKETT>Look, there's only one reason

696
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:49,060
<25-1,BECKETT>还拒不上报闯入案的原因只有一个
<25-1,BECKETT>that lawyer would stonewall us and not report a break-in.

697
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:50,650
<25-1,BECKETT>他肯定有所隐瞒
<25-1,BECKETT>He's covering something up.

698
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:53,820
<25-2,CASTLE>可疑的律所  神秘的死亡
<25-2,CASTLE>Shady law firm, mysterious death,

699
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:55,690
<25-2,CASTLE>匡扶正义的有志青年
<25-2,CASTLE>a young man righting wrongs.

700
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:58,290
<25-2,CASTLE>也许罗根·摩尔更像是《永不妥协》女主
<25-2,CASTLE>Maybe Logan Moore is like Erin Brockovich,

701
00:27:58,290 --> 00:27:59,360
<25-2,CASTLE>只不过他的武器是滑板
<25-2,CASTLE>But with a skateboard

702
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,690
<25-2,CASTLE>而不是  你知道  其他种种
<25-2,CASTLE>instead of -- you know -- other assets.

703
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:02,760
<25-3,BECKETT>你是说头脑
<25-3,BECKETT>Brains?

704
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,800
<25-4,CASTLE>没错  就是头脑
<25-4,CASTLE>Yes, brains. Yeah.

705
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:07,090
<25-5,BECKETT>莱恩  你能调查一下布伦特·扎列特茨基的律所吗
<25-5,BECKETT>Hey, Ryan, can you look into Brett Zaretsky's law firm?

706
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:10,070
<25-5,BECKETT>媒体新闻  法庭记录  知名案件什么的
<25-5,BECKETT>Uh, press releases, court filings, lawsuits.

707
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:12,190
<25-5,BECKETT>看能不能查出把他和罗根联系起来的信息
<25-5,BECKETT>See if there's anything there that connects him to Logan.

708
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:12,810
<25-6,RYAN>这就去
<25-6,RYAN>I'm on it.

709
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:15,800
<25-7,ESPOSITO>我去问了汤米  罗斯和霍莉
<25-7,ESPOSITO>Hey, I circled back around to Tommy, Ross, and Holly.

710
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:17,870
<25-7,ESPOSITO>就算罗根真的有一位亡友  他们也毫不知情
<25-7,ESPOSITO>If any of Logan's friends died, they don't know about it.

711
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:18,790
<25-8,BECKETT>总得有人知道的吧
<25-8,BECKETT>Well, someone must.

712
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,700
<25-8,BECKETT>你刚说他母亲关在哪里来着
<25-8,BECKETT>Where did you say that his mom was, again?

713
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,060
<25-9,RYAN>泰克尼克监狱
<25-9,RYAN>Taconic correctional.

714
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:25,560
<25-10,BECKETT>我们去看看她知道些什么
<25-10,BECKETT>Okay. Let's see if she can shed some...light.

715
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,100
<25-11,CASTLE>两位  我知道你们想干什么
<25-11,CASTLE>Guys, I know what you're trying to do,

716
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:34,530
<25-11,CASTLE>我知道你们为什么对我这么好
<25-11,CASTLE>why you're being so nice to me.

717
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:35,830
<25-11,CASTLE>贝克特给我提了个醒
<25-11,CASTLE>Beckett clued me in.

718
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:38,030
<25-11,CASTLE>说实话  你们让我更纠结了
<25-11,CASTLE>And, honestly, it's just making it harder,

719
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:40,190
<25-11,CASTLE>所以你们  正常点就行
<25-11,CASTLE>so just...act normal.

720
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:43,200
<25-12,ESPOSITO>-晕  -晕
<25-12,ESPOSITO>- Man. - Man.

721
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:45,040
<25-13,RYAN>我们俩真让他左右为难啊
<25-13,RYAN>He really can't decide between us.

722
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,240
<25-14,ESPOSITO>这也不能怨他
<25-14,ESPOSITO>Yeah, but can you blame him?

723
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,080
<25-14,ESPOSITO>可怜娃  两头都是好兄弟
<25-14,ESPOSITO>I mean, poor guy. He's in a no-win situation.

724
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:52,490
<25-14,ESPOSITO>话说回来  我可能有办法
<25-14,ESPOSITO>But... I may have a solution.

725
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,000
<25-14,ESPOSITO>来吧
<25-14,ESPOSITO>Come on.

726
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:57,520
<26-1,LANIE>让我先把思路理理清
<26-1,LANIE>Okay, let me -- let me get this straight.

727
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:02,210
<26-1,LANIE>你俩想让我决定谁才是卡塞尔的伴郎
<26-1,LANIE>You guys want me to decide who should be Castle's best man?

728
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:04,130
<26-2,ESPOSITO>非你莫属啊  你是伴娘
<26-2,ESPOSITO>Yeah. It's perfect. You're the maid of honor.

729
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:06,440
<26-2,ESPOSITO>你来选  我们通知卡塞尔  这是多赢局面
<26-2,ESPOSITO>So you pick, we let Castle know. Everybody wins.

730
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,650
<26-3,RYAN>哈维这不成  她当然会选你
<26-3,RYAN>Javi, this is ridiculous. Of course she's gonna pick you.

731
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,600
<26-4,ESPOSITO>那是因为我身上有独一无二的
<26-4,ESPOSITO>That's because there's no better best-man material

732
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,560
<26-4,ESPOSITO>优质伴郎气质
<26-4,ESPOSITO>than this man right here.

733
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:12,210
<26-4,ESPOSITO>是吧  心肝
<26-4,ESPOSITO>Right, baby?

734
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:16,610
<26-5,LANIE>哈维  就咱俩的历史  你真以为我会选你
<26-5,LANIE>Javi, do you really think I'd pick you with our history?

735
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:19,470
<26-6,RYAN>看来大局已定了
<26-6,RYAN>Well, I guess that's settled.

736
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:22,950
<26-7,LANIE>这个大局就是  你俩纯属发傻
<26-7,LANIE>What's settled is, you two are idiots.

737
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:24,780
<26-7,LANIE>我谁都不会选
<26-7,LANIE>I'm not picking either one of you.

738
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:25,900
<26-7,LANIE>知道为什么吗
<26-7,LANIE>You want to know why?

739
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:28,490
<26-7,LANIE>因为我不是新郎
<26-7,LANIE>Because I'm not the groom.

740
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,710
<26-7,LANIE>回见  侦探们
<26-7,LANIE>Detectives.

741
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:32,970
<26-8,ESPOSITO>她嘴好毒
<26-8,ESPOSITO>She's just mean.

742
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:37,370
<26-8,ESPOSITO>总之我们不能强迫卡塞尔二选一
<26-8,ESPOSITO>Well...we can't force Castle to choose between us.

743
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:39,130
<26-9,ESPOSITO>肯定有别的办法
<26-9,ESPOSITO>There's got to be another way.

744
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:49,290
<26-9,ESPOSITO>两天前狱警告诉我我儿子死了
<26-9,ESPOSITO>Two days ago, the warden told me my son was dead.

745
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:53,050
<26-9,ESPOSITO>我一直在等人来
<26-9,ESPOSITO>So I'm just waiting for someone to come along

746
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:54,370
<26-9,ESPOSITO>告诉我那狱警说错了
<26-9,ESPOSITO>and tell me that he was wrong --

747
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,660
<26-9,ESPOSITO>告诉我他们搞错人了
<26-9,ESPOSITO>That there's been some sort of mistake.

748
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,760
<27-1,BECKETT>节哀顺变
<27-1,BECKETT>We're sorry for your loss.

749
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,620
<27-1,BECKETT>我很久之前就失去他了
<27-1,BECKETT>I lost him a long time ago.

750
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:09,860
<27-2,BECKETT>罗根是否跟你提起过他的一位去世的朋友
<27-2,BECKETT>Did Logan ever talk to you about a friend of his dying?

751
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:12,540
<27-3,CASTLE>比如在某些非常情况下
<27-3,CASTLE>Maybe under unusual circumstances?

752
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:14,090
<27-3,CASTLE>怎么了
<27-3,CASTLE>Why?

753
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:17,190
<27-4,BECKETT>因为我们认为这是罗根被害的线索之一
<27-4,BECKETT>Because we believe that it might be related to Logan's murder.

754
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:23,140
<27-5,CASTLE>有个叫杰的
<27-5,CASTLE>Well, there was Jay.

755
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:24,520
<27-5,CASTLE>杰是谁
<27-5,CASTLE>Who was Jay?

756
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:26,920
<27-5,CASTLE>他是我家附近的一个精瘦的小男孩
<27-5,CASTLE>He was a scrawny little kid from the neighborhood,

757
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,450
<27-5,CASTLE>比罗根小几岁
<27-5,CASTLE>a couple years younger than Logan.

758
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:31,030
<27-5,CASTLE>他常和附近街区的其他孩子在一起玩
<27-5,CASTLE>He and some of the other kids in the neighborhood

759
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:35,140
<27-5,CASTLE>他们自称为"布朗克斯滑板帮"
<27-5,CASTLE>used to call themselves "the Bronx Skate Crew."

760
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:39,680
<27-6,BECKETT>这些孩子都没什么像样的家庭
<27-6,BECKETT>None of them... had much of a home life,

761
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,180
<27-6,BECKETT>所以他们整天都粘在滑板上
<27-6,BECKETT>so they'd just ride around on their boards all day long

762
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:45,350
<27-6,BECKETT>净逛些不该去的地方
<27-6,BECKETT>and...get into places they shouldn't.

763
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,350
<27-6,BECKETT>杰是罗根认为为数不多的
<27-6,BECKETT>But Jay was the one that Logan said

764
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,270
<27-6,BECKETT>比他滑得还好的人之一
<27-6,BECKETT>might be even better than he was.

765
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:52,660
<27-6,BECKETT>杰是怎么死的
<27-6,BECKETT>And what happened to Jay?

766
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:54,860
<27-6,BECKETT>他死于一场事故
<27-6,BECKETT>He was killed in some accident --

767
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:56,530
<28-1,ESPOSITO>大概是六年前吧
<28-1,ESPOSITO>I don't know -- like six years ago.

768
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,450
<28-2,BECKETT>警察也没查出个头绪来
<28-2,BECKETT>Cops never figured out what happened.

769
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:02,750
<27-6,BECKETT>罗根当时有没有和你提起过杰的死
<27-6,BECKETT>Did Logan ever talk about Jay's death at the time?

770
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:04,430
<27-7,CASTLE>有任何反常的地方吗
<27-7,CASTLE>Anything out of the ordinary?

771
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:08,500
<27-7,CASTLE>没有  那是第一次他认识的人死了
<27-7,CASTLE>No. I mean, it was the first time that somebody that he knew died,

772
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,240
<27-7,CASTLE>所以他...很难过
<27-7,CASTLE>So he -- he took it hard.

773
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:17,290
<27-7,CASTLE>杰·迪克逊  12岁
<27-7,CASTLE>Jay Dixon, age 12.

774
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:19,510
<28-1,ESPOSITO>死于2008年4月27日
<28-1,ESPOSITO>He died April 27th, 2008.

775
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:21,220
<28-1,ESPOSITO>验尸官判定为他杀
<28-1,ESPOSITO>Coroner ruled the death a homicide.

776
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,140
<28-1,ESPOSITO>但凶手从未找到
<28-1,ESPOSITO>It was never solved.

777
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:22,960
<28-2,BECKETT>发生什么事了
<28-2,BECKETT>What happened?

778
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,940
<28-3,ESPOSITO>死因是头部受到重创
<28-3,ESPOSITO>C.O.D. was blunt-force trauma to the head,

779
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:27,060
<28-3,ESPOSITO>他的尸体是在一处建筑工地找到的
<28-3,ESPOSITO>and his body was found at a construction site.

780
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:28,250
<28-4,CASTLE>有任何凶手的线索吗
<28-4,CASTLE>Any leads on who did it?

781
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:30,360
<28-5,ESPOSITO>没有  既没有证人也没有嫌疑人
<28-5,ESPOSITO>No. There were no witnesses, no suspects.

782
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,730
<28-5,ESPOSITO>总而言之  没什么可调查的线索
<28-5,ESPOSITO>All in all, it wasn't much of an investigation.

783
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:33,890
<28-6,BECKETT>十二岁的孩子被杀
<28-6,BECKETT>12-year-old gets killed,

784
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:35,710
<28-6,BECKETT>却没有一人去查明真相找出真凶
<28-6,BECKETT>and no one cares enough to find his murderer.

785
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:36,950
<28-7,CASTLE>罗根这么做了
<28-7,CASTLE>Logan did.

786
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:38,080
<28-7,CASTLE>为杰讨回公道
<28-7,CASTLE>Finding justice for Jay

787
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,940
<28-7,CASTLE>是他来到纽约的唯一原因
<28-7,CASTLE>seems to be the very reason he came to New York.

788
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,850
<28-8,BECKETT>但为什么是现在  六年后
<28-8,BECKETT>But why now, six years later?

789
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:44,320
<28-8,BECKETT>为什么罗根认为他时间不多了
<28-8,BECKETT>And why did Logan think he was running out of time?

790
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,590
<28-8,BECKETT>这跟扎列特茨基或是他的律所又有什么关联
<28-8,BECKETT>And what's the connection to Zaretsky or his law firm?

791
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:49,100
<28-9,ESPOSITO>就算是有关联  我也还没找出来
<28-9,ESPOSITO>If there is one, I haven't found it.

792
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,600
<28-9,ESPOSITO>他的名字不在这份文件里  也没有对业主
<28-9,ESPOSITO>He's not named in this file, and there's no wrongful-death

793
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,750
<28-9,ESPOSITO>提出任何过失致死或是任何其他类型的诉讼
<28-9,ESPOSITO>or other litigation against the property owners.

794
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:54,910
<28-10,BECKETT>联系杰的父母
<28-10,BECKETT>Okay, get ahold of Jay's parents.

795
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:57,150
<28-10,BECKETT>看他们最近有没有跟罗根联系过
<28-10,BECKETT>Let's see if they've been in contact with Logan recently.

796
00:31:57,630 --> 00:31:59,410
<28-11,RYAN>快来看看
<28-11,RYAN>Hey, guys. Check it out.

797
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,460
<28-11,RYAN>搜索队刚刚在罗根被杀的那条小道尽头
<28-11,RYAN>Search team just found this camcorder

798
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,290
<28-11,RYAN>发现了这个摄像机
<28-11,RYAN>down the block from where logan was killed.

799
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:05,280
<28-12,CASTLE>一个超八摄像机
<28-12,CASTLE>A Hi8 camcorder.

800
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:08,040
<28-13,RYAN>没错  鉴证组很快地检查了一遍
<28-13,RYAN>Yeah. CSU gave it a quick look.

801
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,860
<28-13,RYAN>上面没有指纹  里面也没有录像带
<28-13,RYAN>No prints, no cassette tape.

802
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:11,220
<28-13,RYAN>但看看这里
<28-13,RYAN>But check it out.

803
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:15,150
<28-14,BECKETT>弹孔  罗根被枪杀时一定拿着这个
<28-14,BECKETT>Bullet hole. So Logan must have had this on him when he was shot.

804
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:17,130
<28-15,CASTLE>看来有人想要撬开录像带槽
<28-15,CASTLE>Looks like someone tried to pry open the cassette slot.

805
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:19,300
<28-16,RYAN>是的  凶手肯定很想要里面的录像带
<28-16,RYAN>Yeah, killer must have wanted whatever was inside.

806
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,630
<28-17,CASTLE>我知道为什么罗根带着摄像机了
<28-17,CASTLE>I know why Logan bought the camera.

807
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:25,530
<28-17,CASTLE>他并不是想要录像
<28-17,CASTLE>He didn't intend to record something.

808
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:27,500
<28-17,CASTLE>他是想要播放一个旧的录像带
<28-17,CASTLE>He wanted to play an old cassette tape.

809
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,750
<28-18,BECKET>你觉得他就是为了偷一盘录像带
<28-18,BECKET>You think that's why he broke into the law offices

810
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:31,120
<28-18,BECKET>才闯进律所吗
<28-18,BECKET>to get a Hi8 tape?

811
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,540
<28-19,CASTLE>杰六年前被杀
<28-19,CASTLE>Jay was killed six years ago.

812
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:34,490
<28-19,CASTLE>如果真的有他被杀的证据
<28-19,CASTLE>If there was evidence of his death,

813
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:36,420
<28-19,CASTLE>有可能会被录在这样的录像带上
<28-19,CASTLE>It's possible it could be on a format like this.

814
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,240
<28-20,RYAN>没错  但我们手里没有录像带啊
<28-20,RYAN>Yeah, but we still don't have it.

815
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:39,460
<28-21,CASTLE>确定吗
<28-21,CASTLE>Or do we?

816
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:40,600
<28-21,CASTLE>看
<28-21,CASTLE>Look.

817
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,730
<28-22,RYAN>录像带一定在凶手扯出来时被撕断了
<28-22,RYAN>The tape must have torn when the killer ripped it out.

818
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,010
<28-22,RYAN>而且...
<28-22,RYAN>And...

819
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:50,590
<28-22,RYAN>瞧瞧吧
<28-22,RYAN>Voil?

820
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:58,670
<29-1,TORY>我把那个录像带的片段数字化了
<29-1,TORY>So, I was able to digitize that tape fragment

821
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:00,910
<29-1,TORY>并成功修复了六秒钟图像
<29-1,TORY>and recover about six seconds of footage.

822
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:05,250
<29-2,BECKETT>看看这个时间标示  2008年4月27日
<29-2,BECKETT>Look at the time stamp -- April 27th, 2008.

823
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:07,170
<29-3,CASTLE>杰·迪克逊就是在这天被杀的
<29-3,CASTLE>That's the same date Jay Dixon was killed.

824
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:09,050
<29-4,TORY>我觉得我能再提高下分辨率
<29-4,TORY>I think I can improve the resolution.

825
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:13,720
<29-5,BECKETT>这是个建筑工地吗
<29-5,BECKETT>Is that a construction site?

826
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:15,910
<29-6,CASTLE>这有可能是杰·迪克逊被谋杀的录像
<29-6,CASTLE>This could be footage of Jay Dixon's murder.

827
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:16,860
<29-7,TORY>开始了
<29-7,TORY>Here we go.

828
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:20,190
<29-8,FULTON>如果你告诉任何人杰被杀的真相
<29-8,FULTON>You ever tell anyone what happened to Jay,

829
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:21,470
<29-8,FULTON>你也会死
<29-8,FULTON>you'll be dead, too!

830
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:25,630
<29-9,BECKETT>这是汤米·弗顿  纽约街头运动的执行总裁
<29-9,BECKETT>That's Tommy Fulton, C.E.O. of New York Street Sports.

831
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:28,880
<29-10,CASTLE>看来六年后  汤米兑现承诺了
<29-10,CASTLE>Looks like six years later, tommy made good on that promise.

832
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:36,990
<30-1,CASTLE>六年前  罗根目击了他的朋友被杀
<30-1,CASTLE>Six years ago, Logan witnesses his friend's murder,

833
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,270
<30-1,CASTLE>汤米威胁罗根如果他告诉别人
<30-1,CASTLE>and then Tommy threatened to kill Logan

834
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:41,080
<30-1,CASTLE>杰被杀的真相  他也会被杀
<30-1,CASTLE>if he ever told what happened to Jay.

835
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,560
<30-1,CASTLE>几年后
<30-1,CASTLE>After all these years,

836
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,020
<30-1,CASTLE>罗根良心过不去
<30-1,CASTLE>Logan couldn't live with the guilt

837
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,660
<30-1,CASTLE>回来揭发真相
<30-1,CASTLE>and came back to expose the truth.

838
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,090
<30-2,BECKETT>所以问题是
<30-2,BECKETT>So, the question is,

839
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:49,300
<30-2,BECKETT>录像带为什么会在律所里
<30-2,BECKETT>what was that tape doing in the law office,

840
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:52,130
<30-2,BECKETT>而扎列特茨基到底跟这件事有什么关联
<30-2,BECKETT>and how is Zaretsky connected to all of this?

841
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,770
<30-3,RYAN>我觉得我查清这个问题了
<30-3,RYAN>I think I figured that one out.

842
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:55,470
<30-3,RYAN>你觉得是谁在处理街头运动节的
<30-3,RYAN>Who do you suppose does all the contract work

843
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,010
<30-3,RYAN>所有合约
<30-3,RYAN>for the Street Sports Festival?

844
00:33:57,290 --> 00:33:58,540
<30-4,BECKETT>布伦特·扎列特茨基
<30-4,BECKETT>Brett Zaretsky?

845
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,210
<30-4,BECKETT>没错
<30-4,BECKETT>Yeah.

846
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:02,110
<30-5,RYAN>而且扎列特茨基还是汤米·弗顿的私人律师
<30-5,RYAN>And Zaretsky also represents Tommy Fulton personally.

847
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:05,100
<31-1,ZARETSKY>我希望你把我叫到这里来
<31-1,ZARETSKY>I hope you have a good reason

848
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,070
<31-1,ZARETSKY>能说出个好理由  警探
<31-1,ZARETSKY>for dragging us down here, detective.

849
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:09,870
<31-2,BECKETT>谋杀这个理由...怎么样
<31-2,BECKETT>How about...murder?

850
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,150
<31-2,BECKETT>得了吧
<31-2,BECKETT>C-come on.

851
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:13,410
<31-3,FULTON>如果又是因为罗根的话  我那天
<31-3,FULTON>If this is about Logan, I-I was at a club

852
00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:16,330
<31-3,FULTON>从午夜到凌晨四点都在一个俱乐部里做宣传
<31-3,FULTON>doing promotions from m-midnight to 4:00 a.m.

853
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:19,750
<31-4,CASTLE>那你2008年4月27日在哪里
<31-4,CASTLE>And where were you on April 27th, 2008 --

854
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:21,280
<31-4,CASTLE>杰·迪克逊被杀的那一天
<31-4,CASTLE>when Jay Dixon was killed?

855
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:27,470
<31-4,CASTLE>如果你告诉任何人杰被杀的真相
<31-4,CASTLE>You ever tell anyone what happened to Jay,

856
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:28,680
<31-5,FULTON>你也会死
<31-5,FULTON>you'll be dead, too!

857
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:35,610
<31-6,BECKETT>当我今早问你杰·迪克逊的时候
<31-6,BECKETT>When I asked you earlier this morning about Jay Dixon,

858
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:37,370
<31-6,BECKETT>你说你从未听说过这个人
<31-6,BECKETT>you said that you never heard of him.

859
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:38,950
<31-6,BECKETT>你撒谎了
<31-6,BECKETT>And that was a lie.

860
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:42,600
<31-7,ZARETSKY>这录像带与罗根和杰的死无关
<31-7,ZARETSKY>That tape proves nothing about Logan or Jay's deaths.

861
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,410
<31-8,BECKETT>我可以确认你出现在
<31-8,BECKETT>I can place you at the scene

862
00:34:44,410 --> 00:34:46,500
<31-8,BECKETT>六年前未破谋杀案的犯罪现场
<31-8,BECKETT>of a six-year-old unsolved murder.

863
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,120
<31-8,BECKETT>我还有间接证据证明
<31-8,BECKETT>I also have circumstantial evidence

864
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,360
<31-8,BECKETT>你为了掩盖真相杀了罗根灭口
<31-8,BECKETT>that you killed Logan in order to cover it up.

865
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,750
<31-8,BECKETT>你觉得陪审团还需要多少证据
<31-8,BECKETT>Now, how much more do you think a jury is gonna need

866
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:54,460
<31-8,BECKETT>把线索联系起来
<31-8,BECKETT>in order to connect those dots?

867
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:55,860
<31-9,FULTON>我可以解释的
<31-9,FULTON>I can explain.

868
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,860
<31-10,ZARETSKY>什么都不要解释  汤米
<31-10,ZARETSKY>No, don't explain anything, Tommy.

869
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:00,060
<31-11,BECKETT>你隐瞒少年被谋杀的证据
<31-11,BECKETT>You think you can hide behind attorney/client privilege

870
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:02,290
<31-11,BECKETT>还想躲在律师客户保密协议这道保护网后吗
<31-11,BECKETT>if you conceal evidence of a child's murder?

871
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:03,920
<31-11,BECKETT>我会取消你的律师资格证
<31-11,BECKETT>I will have you disbarred,

872
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,540
<31-11,BECKETT>然后你就要和你的客户一起受审
<31-11,BECKETT>and then you will stand trial alongside your client.

873
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:08,190
<31-12,CASTLE>或许你该打给你的律师了
<31-12,CASTLE>Maybe you'd like to call your lawyer.

874
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,400
<31-13,ZARETSKY>什么都不要说
<31-13,ZARETSKY>Don't say another word.

875
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:12,560
<31-14,FULTON>布伦特  还有什么意义吗
<31-14,FULTON>Brett, what's the point?

876
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:14,400
<31-14,FULTON>反正整个计划已经搞砸了
<31-14,FULTON>I mean, the whole plan's screwed anyway.

877
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,120
<31-15,ZARETSKY>别再自掘坟墓了
<31-15,ZARETSKY>Stop digging our graves.

878
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,850
<31-16,FULTON>我是不会含冤入狱的
<31-16,FULTON>I'm not going down for murders that someone else did.

879
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:21,680
<31-17,ZARETSKY>天呐  闭嘴  汤米
<31-17,ZARETSKY>For god's sake, shut your mouth, Tommy.

880
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,370
<31-18,FULTON>这次我可不会听你的
<31-18,FULTON>No. Not this time.

881
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:25,810
<31-19,BECKETT>我觉得你应该离开
<31-19,BECKETT>I think you should leave now.

882
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:27,740
<31-20,ZARETSKY>你不能把我赶出去
<31-20,ZARETSKY>Well, you can't kick me out of here.

883
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:28,820
<31-20,ZARETSKY>这个人是我的客户
<31-20,ZARETSKY>This man is my client.

884
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,310
<31-21,FULTON>你被炒了
<31-21,FULTON>You're fired.

885
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:34,370
<31-22,BECKETT>你是要自己离开
<31-22,BECKETT>Either you leave on your own

886
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:36,310
<31-22,BECKETT>还是要我找人把你架走
<31-22,BECKETT>or I will have you forcibly removed.

887
00:35:57,810 --> 00:35:58,620
<31-22,BECKETT>汤米
<31-22,BECKETT>Tommy.

888
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:00,520
<31-23,CASTLE>到底发生了什么
<31-23,CASTLE>What happened?

889
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:04,790
<31-23,CASTLE>杰六年前是怎么死的
<31-23,CASTLE>How did Jay die six years ago?

890
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,470
<31-24,FULTON>我  杰和罗根当时开始
<31-24,FULTON>I started out making skateboard videos

891
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:11,870
<31-24,FULTON>录滑板视频
<31-24,FULTON>with Jay and Logan.

892
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,770
<31-24,FULTON>那天  我在给他俩录像
<31-24,FULTON>That day, I was taping the two of them

893
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:17,890
<31-24,FULTON>而我的朋友D.K.在做翻板
<31-24,FULTON>and my friend D.K. doing tre flips.

894
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:21,440
<31-24,FULTON>小杰  他是天生好手
<31-24,FULTON>Little Jay -- he was a natural.

895
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:24,470
<31-24,FULTON>但  D.K.做不来
<31-24,FULTON>But... D.K. couldn't do it.

896
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,610
<31-24,FULTON>他的滑板技术永远都不及杰
<31-24,FULTON>He was never that good on a board.

897
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:29,480
<31-24,FULTON>杰
<31-24,FULTON>Jay...

898
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:32,090
<31-24,FULTON>嘴比较损
<31-24,FULTON>He had a mouth on him.

899
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:35,720
<31-24,FULTON>他当面嘲笑了D.K.
<31-24,FULTON>And he was rubbing it in D.K.'s face.

900
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:38,970
<31-24,FULTON>D.K.发怒了
<31-24,FULTON>D.K. just snapped.

901
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:43,930
<31-24,FULTON>他抓起杰
<31-24,FULTON>He...grabbed Jay... and...

902
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:49,400
<31-24,FULTON>把他往梁子上撞
<31-24,FULTON>...he slammed him against this beam...

903
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:53,110
<31-24,FULTON>一遍又一遍
<31-24,FULTON>over and over.

904
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,670
<31-24,FULTON>等我们把他拉开的时候
<31-24,FULTON>By the time we could pull him off...

905
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,530
<31-24,FULTON>杰已经断气了
<31-24,FULTON>...Jay was gone.

906
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:06,320
<31-24,FULTON>整个过程都被录了下来
<31-24,FULTON>And the whole thing was caught on tape.

907
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,340
<31-24,FULTON>罗根
<31-24,FULTON>Logan...

908
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:14,140
<31-24,FULTON>他打算报案  但我们都害怕极了
<31-24,FULTON>He wanted to tell someone, but we were all too scared.

909
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:17,050
<31-24,FULTON>D.K.想要那录像
<31-24,FULTON>D.K. wanted that video.

910
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,410
<31-24,FULTON>他害怕失去拥有的一切
<31-24,FULTON>He had the most to lose.

911
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:21,840
<31-24,FULTON>所以
<31-24,FULTON>So...

912
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:25,470
<31-25,CASTLE>我们达成了协议
<31-25,CASTLE>We cut a deal.

913
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,540
<31-25,CASTLE>什么协议
<31-25,CASTLE>What kind of a deal?

914
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:33,760
<31-26,FULTON>五百万美金换那盘录像带
<31-26,FULTON>$5 million for the tape.

915
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,040
<31-27,BECKETT>什么孩子会有五百万
<31-27,BECKETT>What kind of kid has $5 million?

916
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:38,230
<31-28,FULTON>D.K.有
<31-28,FULTON>D.K. Does.

917
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:41,390
<31-28,FULTON>相比他将要从家族里继承的财产
<31-28,FULTON>With what he's getting from his family,

918
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:42,950
<31-28,FULTON>五百万只是九牛一毛
<31-28,FULTON>it was a drop in the bucket.

919
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,800
<31-29,CASTLE>所以你才一直保存带子
<31-29,CASTLE>That's why you had to hang on to the tape.

920
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,450
<31-29,CASTLE>钱来自于信托基金
<31-29,CASTLE>The money was in a trust fund.

921
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:51,070
<31-29,CASTLE>D.K.要等到21周岁才对它享有所有权
<31-29,CASTLE>D.K. wouldn't have acess to it until his 21st birthday

922
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:53,240
<31-30,BECKETT>所以罗根意识到他必须马上行动
<31-30,BECKETT>And that's why Logan knew he had to act right away.

923
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,650
<31-30,BECKETT>因为你会把它交给D.K.
<31-30,BECKETT>You were gonna turn over the tape,

924
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:56,860
<31-30,BECKETT>录像带将随真相一起埋葬
<31-30,BECKETT>and it was gonna get destroyed, along with the truth.

925
00:37:58,980 --> 00:37:59,750
<31-30,BECKETT>对
<31-30,BECKETT>Yeah.

926
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:08,830
<32-1,ROSS>干杯  伙伴们  尽情喝
<32-1,ROSS>Cheers, guys. Drink up.

927
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,180
<32-1,ROSS>祝我生日快乐
<32-1,ROSS>Happy birthday to me.

928
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,600
<32-2,ROSS>警探们  很高兴见到你们
<32-2,ROSS>Hey, detectives! Stoked to see you.

929
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:19,330
<32-2,ROSS>喜欢我新公司的商标吗
<32-2,ROSS>Like my new company logo?

930
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:20,870
<32-2,ROSS>嗯  不错  很独特
<32-2,ROSS>Yeah, it's -- it's killer.

931
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:23,310
<32-3,BECKETT>罗斯·迪·科宁
<32-3,BECKETT>In fact, Ross de Koning,

932
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:25,730
<32-3,BECKETT>现在我们以涉嫌谋杀罗根·摩尔和
<32-3,BECKETT>you're under arrest for the murder of Logan Moore.

933
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:27,720
<32-4,CASTLE>和杰伊·迪克森的罪名逮捕你
<32-4,CASTLE>And the murder of Jay Dixon.

934
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,090
<32-5,ROSS>你在胡说什么
<32-5,ROSS>What are you talking about?

935
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:31,970
<32-6,BECKETT>汤米·弗顿已向我们坦白一切
<32-6,BECKETT>Tommy Fulton told us everything.

936
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:34,180
<32-7,CASTLE>D.K.  很抱歉毁了你的生日派对
<32-7,CASTLE>Sorry to ruin your birthday, D.K.

937
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:37,490
<32-7,CASTLE>但往好的方面想  你已经21岁了
<32-7,CASTLE>But look on the bright side -- the good news is, you're 21 now.

938
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:38,850
<32-7,CASTLE>这意味着你有了信托基金的掌控权
<32-7,CASTLE>You have control of your trust fund,

939
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:40,880
<32-7,CASTLE>有足够的钱来为自己辩护
<32-7,CASTLE>so you'll have plenty of money to spend on your defense.

940
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,570
<32-8,ROSS>不需要  因为你们没有证据
<32-8,ROSS>Well, I won't have to, brah, 'cause you got no proof.

941
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:46,070
<32-9,BECKETT>我想我们会找到证据的  在我们检查
<32-9,BECKETT>I think we will, brah -- after we take a look

942
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:48,190
<32-9,BECKETT>你放在车库的越野摩托车后
<32-9,BECKETT>at that motocross bike in your garage

943
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:50,960
<32-9,BECKETT>再与犯罪现场留下的轮胎痕迹做个比对
<32-9,BECKETT>and match it to the tire treads at the crime scene.

944
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,840
<32-10,CASTLE>现在他们正在搜查你的阁楼
<32-10,CASTLE>We have officers searching your loft right now.

945
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:55,480
<32-10,CASTLE>你觉得他们找到那把杀死罗根的枪的机会有多大
<32-10,CASTLE>What are the odds they find the 9mm you used to kill Logan?

946
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:02,320
<32-10,CASTLE>还想跑
<32-10,CASTLE>Where you going? Huh?

947
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,350
<33-1,BECKETT>有汤米的证词  地检有信心
<33-1,BECKETT>With Tommy's testimony, the D.A. is confident

948
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:14,750
<33-1,BECKETT>以两项谋杀罪将罗斯·迪·科宁定罪
<33-1,BECKETT>that he's gonna get Ross de Koning convicted for both murders.

949
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:17,480
<33-2,CASTLE>至少罗根的愿望实现了
<33-2,CASTLE>At least Logan succeeded in his quest.

950
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:19,960
<33-2,CASTLE>他为朋友伸张了正义
<33-2,CASTLE>He found justice for his friend.

951
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:23,020
<33-2,CASTLE>回想这一切
<33-2,CASTLE>And to think all this happened

952
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:26,450
<33-2,CASTLE>只因为罗斯不甘屈居第二
<33-2,CASTLE>because Ross couldn't bear being second-best.

953
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:29,210
<33-2,CASTLE>你准备好再战一场了吗
<33-2,CASTLE>So, are you ready for another rematch?

954
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,380
<33-3,BECKETT>你确定
<33-3,BECKETT>Really?

955
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:32,480
<33-4,CASTLE>你不会剥夺我翻盘的权利吧
<33-4,CASTLE>You would deny me a chance at redemption?

956
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,040
<33-5,BECKETT>照此下去  你被夺去的可不止于此了
<33-5,BECKETT>Well, keep on this path, there's a lot you'll be denied.

957
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:40,990
<33-6,RYAN>卡塞尔  过来聊两句
<33-6,RYAN>Hey, Castle. You got a minute?

00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,240
<33-7,ESPOSITO>男人间的谈话
<33-7,ESPOSITO>Yeah, we need to have a little man chat.

<33-8,BECKETT>There...are some...reports that I have to file.

960
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:48,320

<33-8,BECKETT>Yeah.

961
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:52,050
<33-9,ESPOSITO>我们想了很久
<33-9,ESPOSITO>So, we've been doing a lot of thinking.

962
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:54,410
<33-9,ESPOSITO>知道你纠结无比
<33-9,ESPOSITO>And, uh, well, we know what you're going through.

965
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:59,860

968
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:05,230
