3
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:11,140
<1-1,KATE BECKETT>珍妮
<1-1,KATE BECKETT>Jenny?

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,000
<1-2,JENNY RYAN>凯特  谢天谢地
<1-2,JENNY RYAN>Kate. Thank God!

5
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:15,090
<1-2,JENNY RYAN>凯文给你打电话了吗
<1-2,JENNY RYAN>Um, h-have you heard from Kevin?

6
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:17,260
<1-3,BECKETT>没有  给你打了吗
<1-3,BECKETT>No, I haven't. Have you?

7
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,000
<1-4,JENNY>也没有  我一直在打给他
<1-4,JENNY>No, I've been calling him

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,910
<1-4,JENNY>想测试下我们的应急机制  但他都没接
<1-4,JENNY>to test our system and he's not answering,

9
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:23,760
<1-4,JENNY>我有点担心
<1-4,JENNY>and I'm freaking out a little bit.

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,880
<1-4,JENNY>你知道他在哪吗
<1-4,JENNY>Um, do you have any idea where he is?

11
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,630
<1-5,JENNY>凯特  在听吗
<1-5,JENNY>Kate? Kate, are you there?

12
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,320
<1-6,BECKETT>在  我在呢
<1-6,BECKETT>Yeah. Yeah, I'm here.

13
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,600
<1-7,JENNY>怎么回事  凯文在哪
<1-7,JENNY>What's going on? Where's Kevin?

14
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,810
<1-8,BECKETT>珍妮  你要冷静点  好吗
<1-8,BECKETT>Jenny, I need you to stay calm, okay?

15
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:41,120
<1-8,BECKETT>出事了
<1-8,BECKETT>Something's happened.

17
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:51,900
<2-1,RICHARD CASTLE>火场里的犯罪现场  还从没遇到过呢
<2-1,RICHARD CASTLE>Crime scene at a fire? Never done one of these before.

18
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:53,750
<2-2,KEVIN RYAN>这案子之后  你可能就不想遇到了
<2-2,KEVIN RYAN>After this, you might not want to.

19
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,280
<2-2,KEVIN RYAN>这栋楼正在修葺
<2-2,KEVIN RYAN>Building was being rehabbed,

20
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,990
<2-2,KEVIN RYAN>所以是不该有人在这里的
<2-2,KEVIN RYAN>so the place was supposed to be empty.

21
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:58,630
<2-2,KEVIN RYAN>看来死者并不知道啊
<2-2,KEVIN RYAN>I guess our victim didn't get that memo.

22
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,560
<2-3,BECKETT>-知道死者身份了吗  -不...
<2-3,BECKETT>- Do we know who our victim is? - Uh, no--

25
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:03,890
<2-3,BECKETT>天哪  是珍妮
<2-3,BECKETT>Oh, oh, oh, oh, my God. Oh, my God. It's Jenny.

26
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:05,340
<2-4,RYAN>她要生了  珍妮
<2-4,RYAN>It's go time. Hi, Jenny.

28
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:06,480
<2-4,RYAN>开始宫缩了吗  有没有...
<2-4,RYAN>Are you having contractions? Are you--

30
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,840
<2-4,RYAN>没事  是该再检查一次
<2-4,RYAN>No. No, it's good to double-check

31
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,780
<2-4,RYAN>我手机好不好使  或是检查三次
<2-4,RYAN>if my phone's working-- or triple-check.

33
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:16,340
<2-4,RYAN>好了  亲爱的  回聊
<2-4,RYAN>Okay, all right, sweetie. Talk to you soon.

34
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,550
<2-4,RYAN>假警报
<2-4,RYAN>False alarm.

35
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:20,830
<2-5,CASTLE>-她预产期过了两天了  -三天了
<2-5,CASTLE>- What is she, uh, two days past her due date? - Three.

36
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:23,150
<2-6,RYAN>随时都可能生
<2-6,RYAN>So, it could happen at any minute.

37
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:25,050
<2-6,RYAN>能相信吗  我要做爸爸了
<2-6,RYAN>Can you believe it? Me as a dad.

38
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:27,010
<2-7,BECKETT>莱恩  你会是个好爸爸的
<2-7,BECKETT>No, Ryan, you're gonna be great.

39
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,260
<2-8,CASTLE>取好名字了吗
<2-8,CASTLE>You guys pick a name?

40
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:29,530
<2-9,RYAN>没有  我们有分歧
<2-9,RYAN>No, we couldn't agree on one.

41
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:31,880
<2-9,RYAN>看是男孩还是女孩  然后再决定
<2-9,RYAN>So we're waiting to see if it's a boy or a girl, and then decide.

42
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,800
<2-10,CASTLE>允许我建议  科斯莫
<2-10,CASTLE>May I suggest... "Cosmo"?

43
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:35,810
<2-11,RYAN>不允许
<2-11,RYAN>No, you may not.

44
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,390
<2-11,RYAN>给我家孩子取名
<2-11,RYAN>And rather than pick a name for my kid,

45
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:38,640
<2-11,RYAN>还不如定下大婚日子
<2-11,RYAN>you should pick a date for your wedding.

46
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,580
<2-12,CASTLE>定下大婚日子  我准备带她私奔呢
<2-12,CASTLE>Pick a date for my wedding? I was planning on bringing her.

47
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,870
<2-13,BECKETT>是吗  什么时候  说不定我有约呢
<2-13,BECKETT>Really? When is that? I might have plans.

48
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,010
<3-1,MARK KIMBALL>我叫马克·金柏尔  建筑安全部的
<3-1,MARK KIMBALL>I'm Mark Kimball, building and safety.

49
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:53,300
<3-1,MARK KIMBALL>你们非要进来吗
<3-1,MARK KIMBALL>Do you guys really need to be in here?

50
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,860
<3-2,BECKETT>我们的犯罪现场在这里
<3-2,BECKETT>It's where our crime scene is.

51
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:57,170
<3-3,KIMBALL>尽量快点  不要久留
<3-3,KIMBALL>Well, don't stay any longer than you have to.

52
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:59,370
<3-3,KIMBALL>大火烧坏了房屋结构  我得撤空整栋大楼
<3-3,KIMBALL>Fire did structural damage. I need to clear the building.

53
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:00,650
<3-4,RYAN>我们很快的
<3-4,RYAN>We should be in and out.

54
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:02,100
<3-4,RYAN>-好吧  -谢谢
<3-4,RYAN>- Okay. - Thanks.

55
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:08,890
<3-4,RYAN>知道死者身份了吗
<3-4,RYAN>So, do we know who the victim is?

56
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:13,370
<4-1,BECKETT>不知道  他有钱包  但已经烧烂了
<4-1,BECKETT>Nope. Dude had a wallet. It's burned to a crisp.

57
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:15,390
<4-2,RYAN>如果是个"他"的话  已经很难分辨了
<4-2,RYAN>Even if he was a dude. It's even hard to tell that.

58
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:16,560
<4-3,CASTLE>懂你意思了
<4-3,CASTLE>I see what you mean.

59
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,980
<4-4,LANIE PARISH>事实上  他是个男人
<4-4,LANIE PARISH>Actually, he is a dude,

60
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,910
<4-4,LANIE PARISH>我现在差不多只能告诉你们这些
<4-4,LANIE PARISH>which is about all I could tell you right now.

61
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,870
<4-5,BECKETT>-这是弹孔吗  -可能是九毫米口径的
<4-5,BECKETT>- Is that a bullet hole? - Probably a nine.

62
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:26,820
<4-6,LANIE>不必说  这不是自然死亡
<4-6,LANIE>So needless to say, this wasn't from natural causes.

63
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,500
<4-7,DELIA BURTON>火灾也是人为的
<4-7,DELIA BURTON>Neither was the fire.

64
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,590
<4-8,RYAN>这位是德利娅·波顿副队长
<4-8,RYAN>This is Lieutenant Delia Burton.

65
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:32,310
<4-8,RYAN>纽约消防局的火灾调查员
<4-8,RYAN>She's a fire investigator with F.D.N.Y.

66
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,730
<4-8,RYAN>贝克特警探  卡塞尔先生
<4-8,RYAN>Detective Beckett. Mr. Castle.

67
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,470
<4-9,BECKETT>幸会
<4-9,BECKETT>Nice to meet you.

68
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,090
<4-9,BECKETT>这是蓄意纵火吗
<4-9,BECKETT>So this was arson?

69
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,430
<4-10,BURTON>看样子是的
<4-10,BURTON>Well, it's looking that way.

70
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:40,330
<4-10,BURTON>我在起火点找到了少量助燃剂
<4-10,BURTON>I found miniscule traces of accelerant at the flashpoint.

71
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:42,770
<4-11,CASTLE>凶手为掩盖凶杀案而放火
<4-11,CASTLE>So the killer set the fire to cover up the murder?

72
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:44,830
<4-12,BURTON>但尸体上却没有助燃剂
<4-12,BURTON>Except there's no accelerant on the body.

73
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:47,530
<4-12,BURTON>而起火点在这栋楼的更里面
<4-12,BURTON>And the fire's flashpoint is deeper in the building.

74
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,310
<4-12,BURTON>通常要处理掉一具尸体
<4-12,BURTON>You know, normally, when you're disposing of a body,

75
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,710
<4-12,BURTON>都会确保尸体着了火
<4-12,BURTON>you're gonna make sure it burns.

76
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,240
<4-13,BECKETT>也许死者抓到纵火犯在放火
<4-13,BECKETT>So maybe our victim surprised the arsonist--

77
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,730
<4-14,CASTLE>纵火犯就杀了他灭口
<4-14,CASTLE>and the arsonist killed him, silencing him as a witness?

78
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:57,060
<4-15,BURTON>我看挺像
<4-15,BURTON>That's how it looks to me.

79
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,940
<4-15,BURTON>不过凶杀案可不是我的专长
<4-15,BURTON>Then again, homicide's not my specialty.

80
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,960
<4-16,BECKETT>但火灾是
<4-16,BECKETT>No, uh, but fire is.

81
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,840
<4-16,BECKETT>你有发现的话
<4-16,BECKETT>Would you mind keeping me in the loop

82
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,350
<4-16,BECKETT>能通知我吗
<4-16,BECKETT>in case you find anything else?

83
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:06,390
<4-16,BECKETT>好
<4-16,BECKETT>Sure.

84
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:08,720
<4-17,BURTON>我搞清楚怎么回事就通知你
<4-17,BURTON>As soon as I know what happened, so will you.

85
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,220
<4-18,CASTLE>-什么情况  -这栋楼
<4-18,CASTLE>- Oh, what was that? - The building.

86
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,040
<4-19,BURTON>你们该走了
<4-19,BURTON>You guys should probably go.

87
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:16,260
<4-20,CASTLE>有道理
<4-20,CASTLE>Sounds good.

88
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,290
<4-20,CASTLE>回见
<4-20,CASTLE>See ya.

89
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,700
<4-21,BECKETT>我要嫁这号人
<4-21,BECKETT>I'm... marrying him.

90
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:26,140
<4-22,RYAN>去查查这地方的业主是谁吧
<4-22,RYAN>Uh, why don't we just look into whoever owns this place?

91
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,630
<4-23,BECKETT>看他们知不知道谁会在这里
<4-23,BECKETT>See if they know who might've been in here.

92
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,460
<4-24,RYAN>好
<4-24,RYAN>Right.

93
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:31,120
<5-1,ART TORINO>我不知道他是谁
<5-1,ART TORINO>I have no idea who he is.

94
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,120
<5-1,ART TORINO>那栋楼在翻新  不该有人在里面的
<5-1,ART TORINO>Wasn't nobody supposed to be in there on account of the renovation.

95
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,660
<5-3,TORINO>也许那家伙是个流浪汉或蹭房的吧
<5-3,TORINO>Maybe the guy was a bum or a squatter or something.

96
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,560
<5-3,TORINO>但也是一条人命  真是悲剧啊
<5-3,TORINO>But, hey, you know. Human life, still a tragedy, right?

97
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,170
<5-4,BECKETT>图里奥先生  我们来谈谈为什么那里没人吧
<5-4,BECKETT>Mr. Turino, let's talk about why no one was there.

98
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:45,280
<5-4,BECKETT>连个保安都没有
<5-4,BECKETT>Not even a security guard.

99
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,540
<5-4,BECKETT>你三个月前停止翻新之后
<5-4,BECKETT>Wasn't your building basically abandoned

100
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,730
<5-4,BECKETT>那栋楼不是就荒废了吗
<5-4,BECKETT>after you stopped renovations three months ago?

101
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,530
<5-5,CASTLE>因为资金短缺
<5-5,CASTLE>Due to a cash flow problem?

102
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:52,630
<5-6,TORINO>再说一遍你是谁
<5-6,TORINO>Who are you again?

103
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,440
<5-7,CASTLE>我只是不禁注意到
<5-7,CASTLE>Just someone who couldn't help but notice

104
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,240
<5-7,CASTLE>你的银行给那栋楼定了很高的保险金
<5-7,CASTLE>your bank required high levels of insurance on that building

105
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,290
<5-7,CASTLE>这是给你贷款的条件
<5-7,CASTLE>as a condition of granting you the loan.

106
00:03:59,310 --> 00:03:59,950
<5-8,TORINO>所以呢
<5-8,TORINO>So?

107
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,680
<5-9,BECKETT>所以一份全额保险赔付
<5-9,BECKETT>So a total-loss insurance claim

108
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,590
<5-9,BECKETT>可以解决你所有的资金流问题
<5-9,BECKETT>would solve all of your cash flow problems.

109
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:07,270
<5-10,CASTLE>对  不足之处是你要因为谋杀而进监狱
<5-10,CASTLE>Right. The downside being, you'll go to prison for murder.

110
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:08,650
<5-11,TORINO>开什么玩笑
<5-11,TORINO>Are you kidding me?

111
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:11,120
<5-11,TORINO>我不会烧了自己的楼
<5-11,TORINO>I wouldn't burn down my own building.

112
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,090
<5-11,TORINO>好吧  烧楼的肯定另有其人
<5-11,TORINO>Okay, somebody else must've done it.

113
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,820
<5-12,BECKETT>告诉我  图里奥先生
<5-12,BECKETT>Tell me, Mr. Turino,

114
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:17,630
<5-12,BECKETT>你跟有组织犯罪有关系吗
<5-12,BECKETT>Are you involved in organized crime?

115
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,240
<5-13,TORINO>这话我可不爱听
<5-13,TORINO>I take offense to that.

116
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:21,700
<5-13,TORINO>就因为我是意大利人  我就是黑帮的吗
<5-13,TORINO>Just because I'm Italian, I'm in the mob?

117
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,210
<5-14,BECKETT>不  我觉得你是黑帮成员是因为你是
<5-14,BECKETT>No, I think you are in the mob because you're a known member

118
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:27,130
<5-14,BECKETT>曼奈利犯罪家族的已知成员  而且你有
<5-14,BECKETT>of the Maneri crime family, and you also have convictions

119
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:30,530
<5-14,BECKETT>勒索  诈骗和暴力犯罪的前科
<5-14,BECKETT>in racketeering, fraud, assault...

120
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:33,020
<5-15,TORINO>好吧  可我已经改过自新了
<5-15,TORINO>Yeah, okay. Okay. I moved on.

121
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,650
<5-15,TORINO>我已经不过那种生活了
<5-15,TORINO>I'm out of the life now.

122
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,500
<5-15,TORINO>我的梦想就是修复那座大楼
<5-15,TORINO>It was my dream to rehab that building

123
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,890
<5-15,TORINO>然后卖掉它  去博卡过退休生活
<5-15,TORINO>and flip it, retire to Boca.

124
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:44,070
<5-15,TORINO>现在那个梦想  已经灰飞烟灭了
<5-15,TORINO>Now that dream? It's up in smoke.

125
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,930
<6-2,BECKETT>-贝克特  -怎么了
<6-2,BECKETT>- Yo, Beckett. - Yeah?

126
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:30,090
<6-3,ESPOSITO>阿特·图里奥的不在场证明确认了
<6-3,ESPOSITO>So Art Turino's alibi checks out.

127
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,580
<6-3,ESPOSITO>他昨晚在粉红宫殿绅士俱乐部
<6-3,ESPOSITO>He was at the Pink Palace Gentleman's Club last night,

128
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,920
<6-3,ESPOSITO>晚上八点到凌晨四点一直在看脱衣舞
<6-3,ESPOSITO>stuffing g-strings from 8:00 P.M. To 4:00 A.M.

129
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,200
<6-4,BECKETT>对  但他不代表他是清白的
<6-4,BECKETT>Yeah, but that doesn't mean he's in the clear.

130
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,650
<6-4,BECKETT>我是说  图里奥不会自己动手的
<6-4,BECKETT>I mean, Turino wouldn't do this himself.

131
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:39,250
<6-5,ESPOSITO>好吧  我去查查跟他亲近的人里
<6-5,ESPOSITO>Well, I'll see if anyone he's been hanging with

132
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,230
<6-5,ESPOSITO>有没有人跟纵火有关
<6-5,ESPOSITO>has any connection to arson.

133
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:41,300
<6-6,BECKETT>好  我去找卡塞尔
<6-6,BECKETT>Okay, I'll grab Castle.

134
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,410
<6-6,BECKETT>我们去看看蕾妮在死者身上有没有新发现
<6-6,BECKETT>We'll see if Lanie's got anything new on our vic.

135
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:48,410
<7-1,LANIE>还是身份不明  他也不在失踪人口报告里
<7-1,LANIE>Still no I.D., and he's not in any missing person's report.

136
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:49,480
<7-2,BECKETT>子弹有匹配结果吗
<7-2,BECKETT>We get a match on the bullet?

137
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,550
<7-3,LANIE>系统里没有
<7-3,LANIE>It's not in the system,

138
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:53,830
<7-3,LANIE>但死因绝对是头部中枪
<7-3,LANIE>but the cause of death was definitely a G.S.W. to the head.

139
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,240
<7-3,LANIE>肺部没有烟尘
<7-3,LANIE>No smoke in the lungs,

140
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,720
<7-3,LANIE>所以起火前他就已经死了
<7-3,LANIE>so he was already dead before the fire got going.

141
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,580
<7-4,CASTLE>总比被活活烧死好
<7-4,CASTLE>Whoa. Beats getting roasted alive.

142
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,070
<7-5,LANIE>我同意你的观点
<7-5,LANIE>I'm right there with you.

143
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:03,920
<7-5,LANIE>而且  他很健康  满身肌肉
<7-5,LANIE>Also, he was healthy, muscular.

144
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,390
<7-5,LANIE>他的牙齿很整齐  所以他可能不是流浪汉
<7-5,LANIE>His teeth were in good shape. So he probably wasn't homeless.

145
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,540
<7-5,LANIE>再说他的医疗状况也很好
<7-5,LANIE>Plus he had great medical care.

146
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,490
<7-6,BECKETT>你怎么知道
<7-6,BECKETT>How can you tell?

147
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,850
<7-7,LANIE>他有一条骨折的腿...
<7-7,LANIE>He had a fractured leg that was splinted...

148
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,500
<7-7,LANIE>用金属板和钢钉固定着
<7-7,LANIE>with metal plates and screws.

149
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,900
<7-8,CASTLE>-手术质量很高  -钢板可以追查来源吗
<7-8,CASTLE>- Quality work, too. - Can the plate be traced?

150
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:18,880
<7-9,LANIE>我已经在查了
<7-9,LANIE>I'm already on it.

151
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:21,380
<7-10,BURTON>是左腿吗
<7-10,BURTON>Was it the left leg?

152
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,580
<7-10,BURTON>股骨前区  中部往下
<7-10,BURTON>Anterior femur, mid-way down?

153
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,940
<7-11,LANIE>是的  你怎么知道
<7-11,LANIE>That's right. How did you know?

154
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,000
<7-12,BURTON>我知道他是谁
<7-12,BURTON>I know who he is.

155
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,260
<7-12,BURTON>他是个名叫布雷克·麦凯恩的火灾调查员
<7-12,BURTON>He's a fire investigator named Blake McCann.

156
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:37,110
<7-12,BURTON>他曾经是我的搭档
<7-12,BURTON>He was my partner.

166
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:50,200
<8-1,BECKETT>好的  知道了  蕾妮
<8-1,BECKETT>Okay. Got it, Lanie.

167
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:59,090
<8-2,BECKETT>牙科记录确认了受害者就是布雷克·麦凯恩
<8-2,BECKETT>So dental records confirm that our victim is Blake McCann.

168
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:03,370
<8-3,BECKETT>我很遗憾
<8-3,BECKETT>I'm very sorry.

169
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:04,960
<8-4,BURTON>他是个好人
<8-4,BURTON>He was a good man.

170
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,010
<8-4,BURTON>我见过的最正直的人
<8-4,BURTON>Most decent person I ever knew.

171
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,550
<8-5,BECKETT>你知道他认识的人里
<8-5,BECKETT>Do you know of anyone in his life

172
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:11,960
<8-5,BECKETT>有谁想要伤害他吗
<8-5,BECKETT>that would've wanted to hurt him?

173
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,920
<8-6,BURTON>只有留下这个的人
<8-6,BURTON>Just the person who left this.

174
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,190
<8-6,BURTON>我在火灾现场发现的
<8-6,BURTON>I found it at the fire scene.

175
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:21,290
<8-7,BECKETT>这是什么
<8-7,BECKETT>What is it?

176
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,610
<8-8,BURTON>这个图案是由助燃剂产生的
<8-8,BURTON>This pattern is made by accelerant.

177
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,480
<8-8,BURTON>根据这种图案来看  可能是过氧化苯乙酰
<8-8,BURTON>From the staining pattern, probably benzoyl peroxide,

178
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,770
<8-8,BURTON>从管子里挤出来的
<8-8,BURTON>Squeezed from a tube.

179
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:32,000
<8-8,BURTON>布雷克在另外十个火灾现场也发现了同样的图案
<8-8,BURTON>Blake found the same pattern in ten other burned buildings.

180
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,050
<8-9,CASTLE>那么这是个标志
<8-9,CASTLE>So it's a signature?

181
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:34,770
<8-9,CASTLE>一个连环纵火犯的标志
<8-9,CASTLE>Of a serial arsonist.

182
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:37,000
<8-10,BURTON>布雷克已经追踪这家伙好几年了
<8-10,BURTON>Blake has been hunting this guy for years.

183
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,190
<8-10,BURTON>他所有空闲时间都在干这个
<8-10,BURTON>It's how he spent every spare minute.

184
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:42,730
<8-10,BURTON>他刚刚开始利用假期来查这个案子
<8-10,BURTON>In fact, he had just taken some vacation days to work the case.

185
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:46,290
<8-10,BURTON>当我发现这个标志时  我给他打了电话
<8-10,BURTON>When I found the symbol, I called him.

186
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,760
<8-10,BURTON>他没有回电话  我...
<8-10,BURTON>He didn't call me back. I, uh...

187
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:53,130
<8-10,BURTON>我有一种很糟的感觉
<8-10,BURTON>I just had an awful feeling.

188
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:56,910
<8-11,BECKETT>他知道纵火犯是谁吗  有嫌疑人吗
<8-11,BECKETT>Did he know who the arsonist is? Did he have any suspects?

189
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,280
<8-12,BURTON>他从没跟我说过
<8-12,BURTON>Not that he ever told me.

190
00:07:58,290 --> 00:07:59,410
<8-12,BURTON>他只是称他为"幻影"
<8-12,BURTON>He just called him "The phantom,"

191
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:01,120
<8-12,BURTON>因为他总能在人们注意不到的时候
<8-12,BURTON>Because he seemed to be able to slip in and out

192
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,680
<8-12,BURTON>溜进大楼又溜出来
<8-12,BURTON>of buildings without people ever noticing.

193
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,090
<8-13,CASTLE>直到目前为止
<8-13,CASTLE>Until now, maybe.

194
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,070
<8-14,BURTON>应该就是这样  对吧
<8-14,BURTON>Well, that's gotta be it, right?

195
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:07,680
<8-14,BURTON>布雷克去了那座大楼
<8-14,BURTON>I mean, Blake went in that building

196
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,180
<8-14,BURTON>因为他在追那个家伙
<8-14,BURTON>because he was after the guy.

197
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:10,680
<8-14,BURTON>就是那家伙杀了他
<8-14,BURTON>And that's who killed him.

198
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:12,890
<8-15,BECKETT>现在下结论还太早  但这是个切入点
<8-15,BECKETT>It's too soon to know, but it's a place to start.

199
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:15,220
<8-15,BECKETT>我们需要他的那些关于纵火犯的
<8-15,BECKETT>Now, we're gonna need copies of his case files

200
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,830
<8-15,BECKETT>案件资料
<8-15,BECKETT>linked to the arsonist.

201
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,540
<8-16,BURTON>他带了一些回家
<8-16,BURTON>Well, he took a bunch of them home with him.

202
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,050
<8-17,BECKETT>我会让探员去拿的
<8-17,BECKETT>I'll have detectives pick them up.

203
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:22,340
<8-18,BURTON>剩下的在办公室  我会给你拿来
<8-18,BURTON>The rest are at the office. I'll get them over to you.

204
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,330
<8-19,BECKETT>很好
<8-19,BECKETT>Great.

205
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:28,370
<9-1,BECKETT>我跟布雷克·麦凯恩的同事和前妻聊过了
<9-1,BECKETT>So, I talked to Blake McCann's co-workers, his ex-wife,

206
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:31,340
<9-1,BECKETT>如果他有什么敌人  那我没找到
<9-1,BECKETT>and if he's got any enemies, I am not finding them.

207
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,580
<9-2,CASTLE>那就只剩下了"幻影"
<9-2,CASTLE>Leaving us with the phantom.

208
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,220
<9-3,BECKETT>你能别那么叫他吗
<9-3,BECKETT>Can you please not call him that?

209
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,550
<9-3,BECKETT>听起来很傻
<9-3,BECKETT>It just--it sounds silly.

210
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:39,100
<9-4,CASTLE>比"纵火犯"还傻  那个词里有个"犯"
<9-4,CASTLE>Sillier than the "Arsonist"? Which starts with "Arse"?

211
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,300
<9-4,CASTLE>至少"幻影"听起来有点神秘感
<9-4,CASTLE>At least with "the phantom" he's got some mystique.

212
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,400
<9-5,BECKETT>他不配有神秘感  他是个谋杀犯
<9-5,BECKETT>He doesn't deserve mystique. He's a murderer.

213
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,130
<9-6,CASTLE>但杀人不是他通常的犯罪手法
<9-6,CASTLE>Yeah, but killing is not a part of his usual M.O.

214
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:48,410
<9-6,CASTLE>目前为止  所有他烧掉的大楼都是空的
<9-6,CASTLE>Until now, all the buildings he torched were empty.

215
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:50,550
<9-7,BECKETT>好吧  那这些大楼还有什么共同点
<9-7,BECKETT>Okay. All right, so what else do they have in common?

216
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:52,960
<9-8,CASTLE>不太多  所有的建筑都比较破旧
<9-8,CASTLE>Not much. All the buildings were older,

217
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:55,290
<9-8,CASTLE>但有些是民宅  有些是办公楼
<9-8,CASTLE>but some were residential, some were office buildings.

218
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:57,160
<9-8,CASTLE>其中有两所在曼哈顿  剩下的在布鲁克林
<9-8,CASTLE>There were two in Manhattan and the rest in Brooklyn

219
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,710
<9-9,BECKETT>-还有皇后区  -所有的大楼都有保险吗
<9-9,BECKETT>- and in Queens. - Were they insured?

220
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,510
<9-10,CASTLE>有几栋有  但是并不是所有
<9-10,CASTLE>A couple of them, but not all of them.

221
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,590
<9-10,CASTLE>所以大概不是受雇的纵火犯
<9-10,CASTLE>So it probably was not arson-for-hire.

222
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,820
<9-11,BECKETT>也就是说他是出于一己私欲
<9-11,BECKETT>Which means he's doing this for himself.

223
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:08,040
<9-11,BECKETT>为了满足内心的欲望而纵火
<9-11,BECKETT>He's burning these buildings to satisfy an inner need.

224
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,770
<9-11,BECKETT>就跟连环杀手一样
<9-11,BECKETT>And like a serial killer,

225
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:11,990
<9-11,BECKETT>他选择这些建筑纵火是有原因的
<9-11,BECKETT>there's a reason why he chooses the buildings he does.

226
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,630
<9-11,BECKETT>肯定存在某种规律
<9-11,BECKETT>There's a pattern or something.

227
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:17,320
<9-11,BECKETT>-怎么啦  -三天前有条记录  麦凯恩写下了一个名字
<9-11,BECKETT>- What? - Entry from three days ago. Mccann wrote down a name.

228
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:18,510
<9-11,BECKETT>亚当·弗格森
<9-11,BECKETT>Adam Ferguson.

229
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,490
<10-1,ESPOSITO>-安全  -安全
<10-1,ESPOSITO>- Clear. - Clear.

230
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,350
<10-3,ESPOSITO>除了我们还有其他人对布雷克·麦凯恩感兴趣
<10-3,ESPOSITO>I'd say someone besides us is interested in Blake McCann.

231
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:39,040
<10-4,RYAN>看来他死后这里被人翻了个底朝天
<10-4,RYAN>Yeah, looks like this place was tossed after he was killed.

232
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,120
<10-5,ESPOSITO>你跟我想的一样吗
<10-5,ESPOSITO>You thinking what I'm thinking?

233
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:41,840
<10-6,RYAN>纵火犯杀了他之后
<10-6,RYAN>That the arsonist shot him

234
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,680
<10-6,RYAN>得知麦凯恩留下了书面记录
<10-6,RYAN>and then got word McCann left a paper trail.

235
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,920
<10-7,ESPOSITO>他到这来找那些能引向他的
<10-7,ESPOSITO>He came here searching for any files or evidence

236
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,250
<10-7,ESPOSITO>文件和证据
<10-7,ESPOSITO>that would point to him.

237
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:49,940
<10-8,RYAN>或许凶手翻得这么乱是因为找不到文件
<10-8,RYAN>Maybe our prep tossed the place because he couldn't find them.

238
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:52,230
<10-9,ESPOSITO>可麦凯恩没有理由把资料藏起来
<10-9,ESPOSITO>But McCann had no reason to hide those files.

239
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:54,580
<10-9,ESPOSITO>他应该会放在饭桌  办公桌或床头上
<10-9,ESPOSITO>They'd be out on a table, a desk or a nightstand.

240
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:55,870
<10-9,ESPOSITO>等等
<10-9,ESPOSITO>Wait.

241
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,610
<10-9,ESPOSITO>麦凯恩的车  没有停在车道上
<10-9,ESPOSITO>McCann's car. It wasn't in the driveway.

242
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,510
<10-10,RYAN>也没有在车库
<10-10,RYAN>Or in the garage.

243
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,620
<10-11,ESPOSITO>他可能是死之前开车去了那栋楼
<10-11,ESPOSITO>He probably drove it to that building before he was killed.

244
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:03,560
<10-11,ESPOSITO>车可能还在那
<10-11,ESPOSITO>It could still be down there.

245
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,070
<10-12,RYAN>对  资料也可能在车上
<10-12,RYAN>Yeah, with those files in it.

246
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,250
<11-1,BECKETT>找到了  亚当·弗格森
<11-1,BECKETT>Here it is. Adam Ferguson.

247
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,090
<11-1,BECKETT>因多次纵火入狱
<11-1,BECKETT>And Blake McCann helped put him away

248
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:11,680
<11-1,BECKETT>布雷克·麦凯恩指证了他
<11-1,BECKETT>on multiple arson counts.

249
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,180
<11-1,BECKETT>他五年前出狱了
<11-1,BECKETT>He got out of prison five years ago.

250
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,050
<11-2,CASTLE>这么凑巧  那也恰好就是
<11-2,CASTLE>Which, by wild coincidence, is right about the same time

251
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:16,720
<11-2,CASTLE>开始发生大楼纵火案的时候
<11-2,CASTLE>those buildings started getting torched.

252
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,150
<11-3,BECKETT>不仅如此  看下这个
<11-3,BECKETT>Not only that, but check this out.

253
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:21,490
<11-3,BECKETT>看看布雷克在被害前一天打给了谁
<11-3,BECKETT>Look at who Blake called on his cell the day before he was killed.

254
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:26,970
<12-1,ADAM FERGUSON>没错  布雷克·麦凯恩确实给我打了电话
<12-1,ADAM FERGUSON>Yeah, Blake McCann Called me.

255
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,230
<12-2,BECKETT>你们谈了些什么
<12-2,BECKETT>To talk about what?

256
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,150
<12-3,FERGUSON>就是朋友之间的闲聊
<12-3,FERGUSON>Just a chat between friends.

257
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:35,270
<12-4,BECKETT>昨晚九点到凌晨一点你在哪  弗格森先生
<12-4,BECKETT>Where were you last night between 9 and 1 a.m., Mr. Ferguson?

258
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,420
<12-5,FERGUSON>怎么了
<12-5,FERGUSON>Why?

259
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:39,500
<12-6,BECKETT>他被一个他所追踪的纵火犯杀掉了
<12-6,BECKETT>Because he was murdered by an arsonist he was hunting.

260
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,170
<12-7,FERGUSON>那真是太可惜了
<12-7,FERGUSON>Well, that's a real shame.

261
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:44,260
<12-8,CASTLE>凶手跟你一样  也是纵火犯
<12-8,CASTLE>An arsonist not unlike yourself.

262
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:46,350
<12-8,CASTLE>事实上  他临死之前
<12-8,CASTLE>Matter of fact, one of his final acts

263
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,360
<12-8,CASTLE>还写下了你的名字
<12-8,CASTLE>was to write down your name.

264
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:50,190
<12-9,FERGUSON>这可不是因为我杀了他
<12-9,FERGUSON>Not because I killed him.

265
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:54,730
<12-9,FERGUSON>肯定是"幻影"干的  我不知道他的真名
<12-9,FERGUSON>It must've been the phantom. I don't know his real name.

266
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,190
<12-10,CASTLE>那你怎么知道这个人
<12-10,CASTLE>How do you know about him at all?

267
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,160
<12-11,FERGUSON>布雷克跟我说的
<12-11,FERGUSON>Blake told me.

268
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:58,450
<12-11,FERGUSON>他给我打了电话
<12-11,FERGUSON>He called me.

269
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:02,310
<12-11,FERGUSON>约我在格林威治一家熟食店见面
<12-11,FERGUSON>Asked me to meet him in some deli in the village.

270
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,800
<12-11,FERGUSON>他完全不知道该怎么抓到这个"幻影"
<12-11,FERGUSON>He was all stalled out about catching this phantom guy.

271
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,130
<12-11,FERGUSON>他向我寻求帮助  我答应帮他
<12-11,FERGUSON>He asked for my help, and I said I'd give it to him.

272
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,940
<12-12,CASTLE>即使是他把你送进了监狱
<12-12,CASTLE>Even though he put you in prison?

273
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,300
<12-13,FERGUSON>布雷克补偿了我
<12-13,FERGUSON>Blake paid me for my time.

274
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,570
<12-13,FERGUSON>此外
<12-13,FERGUSON>Plus, uh,

275
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:19,750
<12-13,FERGUSON>他让我欣赏了那些大火的照片
<12-13,FERGUSON>he let me see some photos of the fires.

276
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:23,190
<12-13,FERGUSON>所以说我们双方都有好处
<12-13,FERGUSON>So we both got something out of the deal.

277
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,730
<12-14,BECKETT>你还跟他说了什么锦囊妙计
<12-14,BECKETT>And what other wisdom did you offer him?

278
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:32,210
<12-15,FERGUSON>任何笨蛋都会洒点汽油  点根火柴
<12-15,FERGUSON>Any idiot can slosh gas around and light a match.

279
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:37,120
<12-15,FERGUSON>可这个人  他懂火  知道怎么让大火蔓延
<12-15,FERGUSON>But this guy? He knew fire, knew how it spread.

280
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,650
<12-15,FERGUSON>你知道吗  楼房就跟人一样
<12-15,FERGUSON>See, buildings are just like people.

281
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:45,870
<12-15,FERGUSON>都有一个弱点  一个容易受到攻击的部位
<12-15,FERGUSON>There's a weak spot, a soft underbelly.

282
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,310
<12-15,FERGUSON>他能够找到它  利用它
<12-15,FERGUSON>He would find it, use it,

283
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:55,120
<12-15,FERGUSON>几乎不用任何催化剂就可以掀起一场地狱之火
<12-15,FERGUSON>unleash an inferno with barely any accelerant.

284
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:56,660
<12-15,FERGUSON>那人
<12-15,FERGUSON>That...

285
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,770
<12-15,FERGUSON>简直就是一位艺术家
<12-15,FERGUSON>is an artist.

286
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:03,620
<12-16,BECKETT>这些怎么帮到麦凯恩
<12-16,BECKETT>So how did any of this help McCann?

287
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:05,440
<12-17,FERGUSON>我给了他一些建议
<12-17,FERGUSON>I gave him some tips.

288
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:08,150
<12-17,FERGUSON>我告诉他  他要找的这个人
<12-17,FERGUSON>I told him he was looking for someone

289
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:10,530
<12-17,FERGUSON>会非常仔细地踩点
<12-17,FERGUSON>who cases buildings carefully.

290
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,630
<12-17,FERGUSON>在行动之前会去查看几次大楼
<12-17,FERGUSON>Visits them a few times before he strikes.

291
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,560
<12-18,BECKETT>还有呢
<12-18,BECKETT>What else?

292
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:19,940
<12-19,FERGUSON>像"幻影"这样的艺术家  他会去欣赏他的杰作
<12-19,FERGUSON>An artist like the phantom? He wants to admire his work.

293
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,930
<12-19,FERGUSON>仅仅放火是不够的
<12-19,FERGUSON>It's not enough that he sets the fire.

294
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,820
<12-19,FERGUSON>他需要感受火焰的热度
<12-19,FERGUSON>He needs to feel the heat.

295
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:30,060
<12-19,FERGUSON>聆听火场的乐声
<12-19,FERGUSON>To listen to the music.

296
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:36,940
<12-19,FERGUSON>火焰的咆哮  房屋被击溃时的哀鸣
<12-19,FERGUSON>The roar of the flames, the moans of the buildings as they give in--

297
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,410
<12-19,FERGUSON>这才是他所渴求的
<12-19,FERGUSON>that's what he lives for.

298
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,080
<12-19,FERGUSON>所以  他每次纵火
<12-19,FERGUSON>Which is why with every fire he sets,

299
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:45,960
<12-19,FERGUSON>他都会在场观赏
<12-19,FERGUSON>he is there watching.

300
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:52,400
<13-1,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>你们怎么看他说的这些
<13-1,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>What do you make of his story?

301
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,910
<13-2,BECKETT>他说他和麦凯恩见面的那个熟食店
<13-2,BECKETT>The staff at the deli where he said he met with McCann

302
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,330
<13-2,BECKETT>那里的店员记得他们
<13-2,BECKETT>remembers seeing them.

303
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:58,760
<13-3,CASTLE>但是却不知道他们俩说了些什么
<13-3,CASTLE>There's no way to really know what they talked about.

304
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,490
<13-3,CASTLE>麦凯恩可能是在说他就是"幻影"
<13-3,CASTLE>McCann could've accused hime of being the phantom.

305
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:01,680
<13-4,GATES>也许他就是
<13-4,GATES>Maybe he is the phantom.

306
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,080
<13-5,BECKETT>我们还没有任何证据能将他
<13-5,BECKETT>We don't have anything that links him

307
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,070
<13-5,BECKETT>和任何一场纵火案联系起来  所以
<13-5,BECKETT>to any of the arsons yet, so...

308
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,270
<13-6,GATES>仔细调查他不在场的证据和他的朋友
<13-6,GATES>Dig into his alibi and associates.

309
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:10,170
<13-6,GATES>看能否找到可靠的证据
<13-6,GATES>See if you can find anything that's solid.

310
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,200
<13-7,BECKETT>好的
<13-7,BECKETT>Okay.

311
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,230
<13-8,CASTLE>他说的这些当中有一点
<13-8,CASTLE>You know, one thing about his story

312
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:16,150
<13-8,CASTLE>听上去很真实  在人物性格上
<13-8,CASTLE>that does ring true-- on a character level--

313
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,920
<13-8,CASTLE>也就是纵火犯享受火灾的过程
<13-8,CASTLE>is about how the arsonist watches his own fires.

314
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,320
<13-9,BECKETT>警员正在排查火灾现场
<13-9,BECKETT>Yeah, well, I've got UNIs canvassing the fire scene

315
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,280
<13-9,BECKETT>并检查附近的监控录像
<13-9,BECKETT>and checking into all the security cameras

316
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,250
<13-9,BECKETT>找案发时在周围逗留的人
<13-9,BECKETT>in the area for anyone that was hanging out.

318
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:30,490
<13-11,ESPOSITO>找到麦凯恩的车了
<13-11,ESPOSITO>Yo, found McCann's car.

319
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:31,990
<13-11,ESPOSITO>距失火地点两条街
<13-11,ESPOSITO>It was parked two blocks from the fire,

320
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,240
<13-11,ESPOSITO>车里有东西
<13-11,ESPOSITO>and there was something inside.

321
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,230
<13-12,BECKETT>纵火案记录
<13-12,BECKETT>Arson files?

322
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,670
<13-13,ESPOSITO>不  貌似是两份他自己搜集的资料
<13-13,ESPOSITO>No, looks like a couple of files that he put together himself.

323
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:38,430
<13-13,ESPOSITO>其中一份记录就是他遇害的大楼
<13-13,ESPOSITO>One's about the building that he was burned up in.

324
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:39,640
<13-14,BECKETT>另一份呢
<13-14,BECKETT>What's the other one?

325
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:42,710
<13-15,ESPOSITO>拿过来
<13-15,ESPOSITO>Give me that.

326
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:46,630
<13-15,ESPOSITO>布鲁克林阿卡迪亚街的一个旧鞋厂
<13-15,ESPOSITO>It's an old shoe factory in brooklyn on Arcadia Lane.

327
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:49,050
<13-15,ESPOSITO>空了五年了
<13-15,ESPOSITO>Looks like it's been empty for five years.

328
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:50,760
<13-16,BECKETT>这些可能是麦凯恩认为
<13-16,BECKETT>You know, maybe those files were on buildings

329
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,890
<13-16,BECKETT>会是纵火目标的建筑
<13-16,BECKETT>that McCANN thought were being targeted.

330
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,090
<13-17,CASTLE>还对了一个
<13-17,CASTLE>He was right about one of them.

331
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,980
<13-18,BECKETT>埃斯波  我们认为纵火犯
<13-18,BECKETT>Listen, espo, we believe that the arsonist

332
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,860
<13-18,BECKETT>会事先对目标进行踩点
<13-18,BECKETT>cases the buildings he burns.

333
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,970
<13-18,BECKETT>去看下那个工厂  看看有没有可疑人物出入
<13-18,BECKETT>So check that factory, and see if anyone suspicious has been seen inside.

334
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:02,970
<13-19,ESPOSITO>这就去
<13-19,ESPOSITO>We're on it.

335
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,710
<14-1,ESPOSITO>真是的  瞧啊
<14-1,ESPOSITO>Man, look at this place.

336
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:27,230
<14-1,ESPOSITO>-失过火的都比这干净  -是啊
<14-1,ESPOSITO>- Fire would be an improvement. - Yeah.

337
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:35,260
<14-3,ESPOSITO>貌似很久没人出入了
<14-3,ESPOSITO>Looks like no one's set foot in here in years.

338
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,630
<14-4,RYAN>好恐怖
<14-4,RYAN>It's pretty creepy.

339
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:43,870
<14-7,ESPOSITO>相信我  兄弟  你电话开着呢
<14-7,ESPOSITO>Trust me, bro, your ringer is all the way up.

340
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:45,000
<14-8,RYAN>就是确认一下
<14-8,RYAN>Just wanted to make sure.

341
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,760
<14-8,RYAN>珍妮随时都可能打来
<14-8,RYAN>Jenny might call me at any minute.

342
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:49,630
<14-9,ESPOSITO>你盯着也没用
<14-9,ESPOSITO>Pulling your phone out isn't gonna make it happen any sooner.

343
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:51,440
<14-9,ESPOSITO>你得镇定
<14-9,ESPOSITO>You just need to chill.

344
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:56,510
<14-10,RYAN>说的好听  好像你多有经验似的
<14-10,RYAN>And... you know this from your vast experience of having zero kids?

345
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,420
<14-11,ESPOSITO>我知道你现在很激动
<14-11,ESPOSITO>All right, you know what? You're all emotional right now.

346
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,180
<14-11,ESPOSITO>所以我原谅你
<14-11,ESPOSITO>So I'm gonna let that go. Hmm.

347
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,040
<14-12,RYAN>好了  走吧
<14-12,RYAN>All right. Let's get back.

348
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,810
<14-13,ESPOSITO>这没什么了
<14-13,ESPOSITO>There's nothing to see here.

349
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:08,210
<14-14,RYAN>等等
<14-14,RYAN>Oh, wait a minute.

350
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,430
<14-14,RYAN>废弃大楼里怎么会有新锁
<14-14,RYAN>Abandoned building with a brand-new lock?

351
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,180
<14-15,RYAN>警察  有人吗
<14-15,RYAN>N.Y.P.D.! Anybody here?!

352
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:41,300
<14-16,ESPOSITO>-安全  -安全
<14-16,ESPOSITO>- All clear. - Clear.

353
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:43,690
<14-18,ESPOSITO>不是吧
<14-18,ESPOSITO>What the hell?

354
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:46,830
<14-19,RYAN>哈维  雷管
<14-19,RYAN>Javi, these are blasting caps here.

355
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,570
<14-20,ESPOSITO>还有很多助燃剂
<14-20,ESPOSITO>And accelerants up the wazoo.

356
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:49,650
<14-20,ESPOSITO>看
<14-20,ESPOSITO>Look.

357
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,170
<14-21,RYAN>这哪是纵火目标  根本就是他的工作间
<14-21,RYAN>This isn't the arsonist's next target. It's his workshop.

358
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:00,960
<14-22,ESPOSITO>我们触响警报了
<14-22,ESPOSITO>We must've set off an alarm.

359
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:03,640
<14-23,RYAN>不是警报
<14-23,RYAN>It's not an alarm!

360
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:05,160
<14-23,RYAN>出去  快
<14-23,RYAN>Get out. Get out now!

361
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:24,310
<15-1,BECKETT>我查了失火点附近的监控摄像头
<15-1,BECKETT>So I checked the security cameras near the fire.

362
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,860
<15-1,BECKETT>被破坏了
<15-1,BECKETT>They were disabled.

363
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:26,800
<15-2,CASTLE>怎么弄的
<15-2,CASTLE>Disabled how?

364
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:28,450
<15-3,BECKETT>有人爬上了电线杆
<15-3,BECKETT>Someone used a can of spray paint,

365
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:30,290
<15-3,BECKETT>用喷漆涂了镜头
<15-3,BECKETT>mounted it on a pole, and blacked out the lenses

366
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:32,800
<15-3,BECKETT>两处都是失火前几分钟
<15-3,BECKETT>of both cameras just minutes before the fire.

367
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,280
<15-4,CASTLE>肯定是纵火犯干的
<15-4,CASTLE>Well, that must've been the arsonist.

368
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,350
<15-4,CASTLE>可能会有目击者
<15-4,CASTLE>Maybe somebody saw them do it.

369
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,740
<15-4,CASTLE>能调查一下周围吗  当然我不行
<15-4,CASTLE>Can we canvass the area? And by "We," I mean,

370
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,210
<15-4,CASTLE>得找别人
<15-4,CASTLE>obviously, somebody else.

371
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,850
<15-5,BECKETT>你看什么呢
<15-5,BECKETT>What are you looking for?

372
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,170
<15-5,BECKETT>别告诉我
<15-5,BECKETT>And don't tell me.

373
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:45,280
<15-5,BECKETT>是在工作场所不该看的吧
<15-5,BECKETT>It's something completely inappropriate for the workplace.

374
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,780
<15-6,CASTLE>这次不是  因为现在
<15-6,CASTLE>No, not this time. Uh, given that everyone

375
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,530
<15-6,CASTLE>大家什么东西都上传
<15-6,CASTLE>uploads everything to the internet nowadays,

376
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:49,520
<15-6,CASTLE>我想或许有人
<15-6,CASTLE>I thought I might see

377
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,590
<15-6,CASTLE>拍了火灾现场的视频  瞧啊
<15-6,CASTLE>if anyone else out there took a video of that fire, and look.

378
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,160
<15-6,CASTLE>如果纵火犯真在现场
<15-6,CASTLE>If the arsonist was watching that fire,

379
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,480
<15-6,CASTLE>说不定会拍到他
<15-6,CASTLE>He might be in this video.

380
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,410
<15-7,BECKETT>-声音开大点  -好
<15-7,BECKETT>- Can you turn up the sound? - Yeah.

381
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:08,710
<15-9,BECKETT>不对劲
<15-9,BECKETT>That doesn't look right.

382
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,250
<15-10,CASTLE>怎么了
<15-10,CASTLE>Seriously?

383
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:12,360
<15-10,CASTLE>这可比监控录像清晰多了啊
<15-10,CASTLE>A lot better quality than a security camera.

384
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,850
<15-11,BECKETT>是大楼不对劲
<15-11,BECKETT>No, babe, I'm talking about the building.

385
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:15,230
<15-11,BECKETT>刚起火
<15-11,BECKETT>That fire just started.

386
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,000
<15-12,BECKETT>想到什么了
<15-12,BECKETT>"Huh," What?

387
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,540
<15-13,CASTLE>没有消防队
<15-13,CASTLE>Fire department's not even there.

388
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,690
<15-14,BECKETT>甚至都没网那赶呢
<15-14,BECKETT>I mean, they're not on their way.

389
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:23,100
<15-14,BECKETT>听不到消防车鸣笛
<15-14,BECKETT>You can't hear the sirens.

390
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,350
<15-15,CASTLE>没人知道着火了  录像者是怎么知道的
<15-15,CASTLE>So how did the cameraman know there was a fire when nobody else did?

391
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,270
<15-16,BECKETT>你听
<15-16,BECKETT>And listen to that.

392
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:30,800
<15-16,BECKETT>他没有在喊人报警
<15-16,BECKETT>He's not yelling for anyone to call 9-1-1.

393
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,650
<15-16,BECKETT>他很沉默
<15-16,BECKETT>He's not saying anything.

394
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,970
<15-17,CASTLE>拍摄平稳流畅
<15-17,CASTLE>Look at the camera work-- very smooth, steady.

395
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:39,710
<15-17,CASTLE>-你不会认为  -没错
<15-17,CASTLE>- You--you don't think-- - Yeah. I do.

396
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:41,110
<15-18,BECKETT>这不仅仅是火灾视频
<15-18,BECKETT>This isn't just footage of the fire.

397
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,590
<15-18,BECKETT>这就是纵火犯拍的
<15-18,BECKETT>It was shot by the arsonist.

398
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:45,480
<15-18,BECKETT>发布视频的人就是纵火犯
<15-18,BECKETT>We have to track down whoever posted that video.

399
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,410
<15-19,CASTLE>抓到你了
<15-19,CASTLE>Got you.

400
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:51,170
<16-1,TECH AGENT TORI>很麻烦
<16-1,TECH AGENT TORI>That won't be so easy.

401
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:54,690
<16-1,TECH AGENT TORI>一般视频里都嵌有相机数据
<16-1,TECH AGENT TORI>Usually there's a file embedded in the video with data on the camera,

402
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:55,930
<16-1,TECH AGENT TORI>但是这里的被删除了
<16-1,TECH AGENT TORI>but it's been stripped out.

403
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,950
<16-2,CASTLE>能查到是在哪上传的吗
<16-2,CASTLE>Can you tell where it was first uploaded?

404
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:58,960
<16-3,TORI>稍等
<16-3,TORI>Let me see.

405
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:03,640
<16-3,TORI>看来这个视频在网上流传很广
<16-3,TORI>Looks like the video got bounced around the net from site to site,

406
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,340
<16-3,TORI>这是首发
<16-3,TORI>But this is where it started.

408
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,690
<16-4,BECKETT>炙爱网站  开玩笑吧
<16-4,BECKETT>Pyrolicious.com. Really?

409
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,100
<16-5,TORI>哇  好吧
<16-5,TORI>Wow. Okay.

410
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,480
<16-5,TORI>一个专门满足恋火癖的网站
<16-5,TORI>A site that caters to fire fetishists.

411
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,660
<16-6,BECKETT>我都不知道还有恋火癖这么个东西
<16-6,BECKETT>I didn't even know there was a fire fetish.

412
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,710
<16-7,CASTLE>准确的说法是"火焰嗜好"
<16-7,CASTLE>The actual term is "Pyrophilia."

413
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:23,030
<16-7,CASTLE>更加有力地证明只要你想得到  在网上就找得到
<16-7,CASTLE>Further proof that the Internet has something for everyone.

414
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:25,140
<16-8,BECKETT>我就不深究你是怎么知道这种事的了
<16-8,BECKETT>I'm not gonna ask how you knew that.

415
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,380
<16-9,BECKETT>那么这段视频是什么时候发布的
<16-9,BECKETT>So when did this video show up there?

416
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:32,030
<16-10,TORI>大约在大火被扑灭后一个小时
<16-10,TORI>About an hour after the fire was put out.

417
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:33,150
<16-11,BECKETT>谁在经营这网站
<16-11,BECKETT>And who runs this site?

418
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:35,880
<16-12,TORI>这网站注册在麦罗·帕弗里克名下
<16-12,TORI>It's registered to a Milo Pavlik.

419
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,140
<16-13,CASTLE>他有犯罪记录吗
<16-13,CASTLE>Does he have a record?

420
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:42,870
<16-14,TORI>还真有  他19岁时把自己家烧了
<16-14,TORI>Oh, yeah. He burnt down his family house when he was 19.

421
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:45,300
<16-15,BECKETT>我们该上哪找这个麦罗·帕弗里克
<16-15,BECKETT>Where do we find this Milo Pavlik?

422
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:51,270
<17-1,BECKETT>麦罗·帕弗里克  纽约警察  快开门
<17-1,BECKETT>Milo Pavlik! N.Y.P.D., open up!

423
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,700
<17-2,MILO PAVLIK>干啥  喂  你这是要干什么
<17-2,MILO PAVLIK>What? Hi, hey. What are you doing?

424
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,040
<17-3,BECKETT>这段视频哪来的
<17-3,BECKETT>Where did this video come from?

425
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,090
<17-4,MILO>你等下  我什么非法的事都没做
<17-4,MILO>Listen, nothing I do here is illegal.

426
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:58,960
<17-4,MILO>我只不过在为各国火焰爱好者提供...
<17-4,MILO>I-I simply provide fire enthusiasts around the globe--

427
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,590
<17-5,BECKETT>这场大火是一个纵火犯引起的
<17-5,BECKETT>This fire was set by an arsonist.

428
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,590
<17-6,CASTLE>而且还害死了人
<17-6,CASTLE>Not to mention a murderer.

429
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:03,990
<17-7,BECKETT>那这视频是谁拍的  你吗
<17-7,BECKETT>So who shot this video? Was it you?

430
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:05,580
<17-8,MILO>不是  说啥  当然不是我
<17-8,MILO>No. What? It w--it wasn't me.

431
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:06,730
<17-9,BECKETT>那怎么挂到你的网站上去了
<17-9,BECKETT>Then how'd it get up on your site?

432
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:07,850
<17-10,MILO>稍等  有短信
<17-10,MILO>Sorry, it's a text.

<17-11,BECKETT>管你有啥  到底是怎么发到你的网站上的
<17-11,BECKETT>I don't care. How did it get up on your site?

434
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:11,740
<17-12,MILO>我在外面有个投物箱  有人往里放东西
<17-12,MILO>I have a drop-box outside. People leave stuff.

435
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,040
<17-12,MILO>这视频存在一个闪存盘上
<17-12,MILO>It was on a U.S.B. drive.

436
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,340
<17-12,MILO>这是优质素材  所以我就上传了
<17-12,MILO>It was quality material, so I uploaded it.

00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,200
<17-13,CASTLE>谁给你的闪存盘
<17-13,CASTLE>Who dropped it off?

438

<17-14,MILO>不知道  我完全不知道
<17-14,MILO>I don't know. I have no idea.

439
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,280
<17-15,BECKETT>你推得倒轻巧  那这个人还有没有
<17-15,BECKETT>That's very convenient. Now, did this person

440
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,650
<17-15,BECKETT>提供什么别的"素材"
<17-15,BECKETT>ever provide any other material?

<17-16,MILO>送给我不少干货
<17-16,MILO>Sent me a few choice items.

443
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,040
<17-17,CASTLE>如果上传这些视频的真的另有其人
<17-17,CASTLE>If it really was someone else and they're submitting videos,

444
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:28,500
<17-17,CASTLE>那此人一定时常光顾这网站
<17-17,CASTLE>then he visits the site.

445
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,210
<17-18,BECKETT>我需要你的网站过去五年
<17-18,BECKETT>I'm gonna need the names of all of your members

<17-18,BECKETT>所有的注册用户信息和网站流量记录
<17-18,BECKETT>along with records of site traffic over the past five years.

447
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:35,330
<17-19,MILO>那你就得出示搜查令了
<17-19,MILO>Pretty sure you need a warrant for that.

448
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,680
<17-20,BECKETT>除非你自愿提供给我
<17-20,BECKETT>Not if you agree to cooperate...

<17-20,BECKETT>我强烈推荐你这么做
<17-20,BECKETT>which I highly encourage you to do.

<17-21,MILO>这是即时新闻提醒
<17-21,MILO>It's a news alert.

452

<17-21,MILO>布鲁克林区现在有一场三级火警
<17-21,MILO>There's a 3-alarm fire going in Brooklyn.

453
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,290
<17-22,CASTLE>布鲁克林的什么地方
<17-22,CASTLE>Where in Brooklyn?

454
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:47,300
<17-23,MILO>阿卡迪亚巷的某间工厂
<17-23,MILO>Uh, some factory on Arcadia Lane.

455
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,280
<17-24,CASTLE>糟了
<17-24,CASTLE>Oh, no.

456
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,620
<18-1,CASTLE>没人接  莱恩和埃斯波西托都打不通
<18-1,CASTLE>Still no answer. Not from Ryan or Esposito.

457
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,460
<18-2,FIRE CHIEF MILLER>探长  你确定他们困在里面了吗
<18-2,FIRE CHIEF MILLER>Detective. Are you sure they're inside?

458
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:31,590
<18-3,BECKETT>是的  他们去查探一栋
<18-3,BECKETT>Yeah, they were checking the building

459
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,510
<18-3,BECKETT>与一起纵火谋杀案有关的建筑
<18-3,BECKETT>in connection with an arson homicide,

460
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:34,890
<18-3,BECKETT>而到现在都没回话
<18-3,BECKETT>and they haven't called in yet.

461
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,250
<18-3,BECKETT>你得提醒一下搜救队
<18-3,BECKETT>You need to alert your rescue teams.

462
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,950
<18-4,MILLER>探长  整座建筑都烧起来了
<18-4,MILLER>Detective, the building's fully involved.

463
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:40,310
<18-4,MILLER>我不得不命令所有突进组队员撤出来
<18-4,MILLER>I just had to pull out the interior attack teams.

464
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:42,710
<18-4,MILLER>等火势稍被控制之后我才能派搜救队进去
<18-4,MILLER>I can't send in a rescue company until it's more contained.

465
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:44,230
<18-5,BECKETT>什么  还要控制
<18-5,BECKETT>Wait, more contained?

466
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:46,540
<18-5,BECKETT>如果我的人在里面  你就得把他们救出来
<18-5,BECKETT>If my guys are in there, I need you to bring them out.

467
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,280
<18-6,MILLER>我们要是能突进去  肯定早就进去了
<18-6,MILLER>If we could get in there, I would.

468
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:49,930
<18-6,MILLER>但建筑物内部已经开始坍塌了
<18-6,MILLER>But there's been a partial collapse inside.

469
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:51,680
<18-6,MILLER>我差点赔了六个弟兄在里面
<18-6,MILLER>I almost lost six of my guys.

470
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,990
<18-6,MILLER>我们会拼尽全力  探长
<18-6,MILLER>We'll do everything we can, Detective,

471
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:55,390
<18-6,MILLER>但这建筑火势太猛  每一层都是
<18-6,MILLER>but this building's a firestorm. Every floor.

472
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,180
<18-6,MILLER>要是你同事真的在里面  那我很遗憾
<18-6,MILLER>If your guys are in there, I'm sorry.

473
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,800
<18-6,MILLER>他们可能已经殉职了
<18-6,MILLER>They're probably already gone.

474
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,300
<18-7,BECKETT>队长
<18-7,BECKETT>Chief?

475
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:03,950
<18-7,BECKETT>这场火灾
<18-7,BECKETT>Fire.

476
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,830
<18-7,BECKETT>怎么烧起来的
<18-7,BECKETT>What started it?

477
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,490
<18-8,MILLER>破损的窗户和建筑结构损毁
<18-8,MILLER>Shattered windows and structural damage

478
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:08,390
<18-8,MILLER>表明是由爆炸引发的
<18-8,MILLER>indicate some kind of explosion.

479
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,280
<18-9,CASTLE>也许
<18-9,CASTLE>Maybe, um...

480
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,970
<18-9,CASTLE>也许他们本来就不在里面
<18-9,CASTLE>Maybe they weren't inside.

481
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:19,540
<18-10,BECKETT>他俩的车在这  又没回话  他们就在里面
<18-10,BECKETT>Their car's here and they haven't called. They're inside.

482
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:20,840
<18-10,BECKETT>我当初就不该派他们进去
<18-10,BECKETT>I shouldn't have let them go in.

483
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,660
<18-10,BECKETT>不该让他们单枪匹马去  我应该...
<18-10,BECKETT>Not alone. I should've--

484
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,340
<18-11,CASTLE>这种事你怎么预料得到
<18-11,CASTLE>There's no way you could've known that.

485
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,610
<18-12,BECKETT>这不怪你
<18-12,BECKETT>This isn't you.

486
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:25,920
<18-12,BECKETT>怪那纵火犯
<18-12,BECKETT>It's the arsonist.

487
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,220
<18-12,BECKETT>是珍妮
<18-12,BECKETT>It's Jenny.

488
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,660
<18-13,CASTLE>她为什么打给你
<18-13,CASTLE>Why would she be calling you?

489
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,520
<18-14,BECKETT>也许她那里有他们的消息
<18-14,BECKETT>Maybe she's heard from them.

490
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:33,600
<18-14,BECKETT>也许她已经知道他们平安了
<18-14,BECKETT>Maybe she knows that they're safe.

491
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:36,710
<18-14,BECKETT>珍妮
<18-14,BECKETT>Jenny?

496
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,100
<18-14,BECKETT>但他都没接
<18-14,BECKETT>And he's not answering.

497
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,850
<18-14,BECKETT>我有点担心
<18-14,BECKETT>And I'm--I'm freaking out a little bit. Um...

498
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:51,500
<18-14,BECKETT>你知道他在哪吗
<18-14,BECKETT>Do you have any idea where he is?

499

<18-14,BECKETT>出事了
<18-14,BECKETT>Something's happened.

504
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,410
<18-14,BECKETT>在消防员奋力将火势控制住之后
<18-14,BECKETT>And as firefighters struggle to bring the blaze under control,

505
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:14,420
<18-14,BECKETT>我们得以确认有两名纽约警局的警探
<18-14,BECKETT>we now have unconfirmed reports that two N.Y.P.D. detectives

506
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:16,690
<18-14,BECKETT>因这场爆炸被困在建筑内
<18-14,BECKETT>were inside the building at the time of the explosion.

<18-14,BECKETT>We'll be bringing you live updates as the news comes in.

508
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:23,210
<19-1,REPORTER>长官  这是真的吗
<19-1,REPORTER>Sir, is it true?

509
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:24,210
<19-2,DETECTIVE>我们还不知道
<19-2,DETECTIVE>We don't know.

510
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,350
<19-3,GATES>目前所掌握的情况是
<19-3,GATES>What we do know is that

511
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:28,080
<19-3,GATES>莱恩警探和埃斯波西托警探去调查
<19-3,GATES>Detectives Ryan and Esposito were investigating

512
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,870
<17-3,BECKETT>那栋建筑和系列纵火案的联系
<17-3,BECKETT>that building for ties to a serial arsonist.

513
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:33,770
<17-4,MILO>那栋建筑发生的爆炸
<17-4,MILO>And it's possible that the explosion in that building

514
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:36,090
<17-5,BECKETT>很有可能是同一个纵火犯故意为之
<17-5,BECKETT>was deliberately set by that same arsonist--

515
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:39,170
<19-2,DETECTIVE>怀疑他与其他十起火灾有关
<19-2,DETECTIVE>A man suspected in ten other fires,

516
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:40,720
<19-3,GATES>而且涉嫌谋杀了一名
<19-3,GATES>as well as the murder of a member

517
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,460
<19-3,GATES>纽约消防局的成员
<19-3,GATES>of the New York Fire Department.

518
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,120
<19-3,GATES>如果情况属实
<19-3,GATES>And if it is true,

519
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:45,990
<19-3,GATES>那么这个变态挨千刀的混蛋
<19-3,GATES>then this sick son of a bitch

520
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:48,720
<19-3,GATES>往他的罪恶清单里加了我们两位同事
<19-3,GATES>has just added two of our own to his list.

521
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:51,770
<19-4,BURTON>在你们桌子上  会找到关于
<19-4,BURTON>On your desk, you will find copies of all the files

522
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:54,510
<19-4,BURTON>每起纵火案的资料
<19-4,BURTON>we have on each one of these arsons.

523
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,830
<19-5,GATES>在里面  会发现蛛丝马迹
<19-5,GATES>Somewhere in there, there is a trail.

524
00:22:56,830 --> 00:23:00,450
<19-5,GATES>在里面  线索会帮我们查清他的身份
<19-5,GATES>Somewhere in there, there is a clue as to who he is.

525
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:02,920
<19-5,GATES>我们要把他绳之以法
<19-5,GATES>And he needs to be brought to account.

526
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,210
<20-1,ESPOSITO>莱恩

00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,940
<20-4,RYAN>我动不了
<20-4,RYAN>Aah, I can't move.

532
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:58,280
<20-4,RYAN>腿被压着了
<20-4,RYAN>My legs are stuck.

533
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,290
<20-5,ESPOSITO>太重了
<20-5,ESPOSITO>It's too heavy! Oh...

534
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:14,120
<20-6,RYAN>这里像个火炉  你应该逃出去  兄弟
<20-6,RYAN>It's an oven in here. You should get out, man.

535
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,410
<20-7,ESPOSITO>要走一起走  搭档
<20-7,ESPOSITO>Not without you, partner.

536
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,270
<20-8,RYAN>我记得最后一件事是地板塌陷了
<20-8,RYAN>Last thing I remember is the floor giving way.

537
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,970
<20-8,RYAN>你觉得我们下坠了几层
<20-8,RYAN>How far do you think we fell?

538
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,500
<20-9,ESPOSITO>至少有两层
<20-9,ESPOSITO>At least two floors.

539
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:24,150
<20-10,RYAN>他肯定非法改造过这地方
<20-10,RYAN>Ah, must've rigged this place...

540
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,580
<20-11,ESPOSITO>以防被发现  用来销毁一切证据
<20-11,ESPOSITO>Probably to destroy any evidence in case it was found.

541
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:29,010
<20-12,RYAN>是啊  也包括我们
<20-12,RYAN>Yeah, including us.

542
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:30,260
<20-13,ESPOSITO>不会让他得逞的
<20-13,ESPOSITO>Not if I can help it.

543
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:32,350
<20-13,ESPOSITO>-准备好了吗  -好了
<20-13,ESPOSITO>- You ready? - Yeah.

544
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:33,890
<20-15,ESPOSITO>好的  我开始搬了
<20-15,ESPOSITO>All right, here we go.

545
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:44,300
<21-1,CASTLE>他们很机敏  会没事的
<21-1,CASTLE>They're smart. They're survivors.

546
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,860
<21-1,CASTLE>如果房子里面有安全的地方
<21-1,CASTLE>If there's a safe place inside that building,

547
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,860
<21-1,CASTLE>他们会找到的  他们可能还活着
<21-1,CASTLE>they may have found it. They may still be alive.

548
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,400
<21-2,BECKETT>是啊  但能撑多久呢
<21-2,BECKETT>Yeah, but for how long?

549
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:53,580
<21-3,BECKETT>麦凯恩车里的那两个文件夹
<21-3,BECKETT>The two folders in McCann's car--

550
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:57,400
<21-3,BECKETT>他知道这栋建筑是下一个目标  怎么知道的
<21-3,BECKETT>he knew that this building was next. How?

551
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,380
<21-4,CASTLE>不知为何  他摸清了了纵火者的套路
<21-4,CASTLE>Somehow, he must've figured out the arsonist's pattern.

552
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:02,340
<21-5,BECKETT>也就是说是有套路可寻的
<21-5,BECKETT>Which means there is a pattern.

553
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,980
<21-5,BECKETT>如果他能摸清套路  那我们也能
<21-5,BECKETT>And if he figured it out, so can we.

554
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:05,780
<21-6,MILLER>往后退
<21-6,MILLER>Move back!

555
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,110
<21-6,MILLER>所有人都后退
<21-6,MILLER>Everybody back!

556
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,430
<21-6,MILLER>往后退
<21-6,MILLER>Move back!

557
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,140
<21-7,BECKETT>怎么回事
<21-7,BECKETT>What's going on?

558
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:10,900
<21-8,MILLER>这栋楼全烧了
<21-8,MILLER>This building's gone.

559
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,760
<21-8,MILLER>我们得把工作重心转移到安全防范
<21-8,MILLER>We have to move to a defensive attack.

560
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,100
<21-8,MILLER>其他的建筑物面临危险
<21-8,MILLER>The other structures are in danger.

561
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,180
<21-9,BECKETT>你们就这么放弃了吗
<21-9,BECKETT>You're just giving up?

562
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:16,440
<21-10,KIMBALL>不  我们只是去排查其他的建筑
<21-10,KIMBALL>No, our teams just went through

563
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,460
<21-10,KIMBALL>它们同样可能发生火灾
<21-10,KIMBALL>the other buildings. They're tinderboxes.

564
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:21,410
<21-10,KIMBALL>如果继续这样下去  有可能烧毁整个街区
<21-10,KIMBALL>If we don't hold the line, we could lose the whole block.

565
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,210
<21-10,KIMBALL>凯特
<21-10,KIMBALL>Kate.

566
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,910
<22-1,RYAN>天花板随时可能塌陷
<22-1,RYAN>That ceiling's gonna give way at any minute.

567
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:34,250
<22-1,RYAN>你得赶快离开这
<22-1,RYAN>You need to get out of here, okay?

568
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:35,120
<22-2,ESPOSITO>闭嘴
<22-2,ESPOSITO>Shut up.

569

<22-2,ESPOSITO>我正救你的命呢
<22-2,ESPOSITO>I'm trying to save your life.

570
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:49,790
<21-8,MILLER>好的
<21-8,MILLER>Here we go.

571
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,030
<21-9,BECKETT>就这
<21-9,BECKETT>There.

572
00:25:58,190 --> 00:25:59,060
<21-10,KIMBALL>稳住
<21-10,KIMBALL>Hold on.

573
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:00,850
<22-2,ESPOSITO>好的
<22-2,ESPOSITO>Yeah.

574

<22-10,RYAN>Where are we?

582
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,260
<22-11,ESPOSITO>看起来像是下层地下室
<22-11,ESPOSITO>Looks like some kind of sub-basement.

583
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:31,860
<22-12,RYAN>没看见有门
<22-12,RYAN>I don't see any doors.

<22-13,ESPOSITO>看来我们要从那出去
<22-13,ESPOSITO>Looks like that was our way out.

586
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:39,780
<22-14,RYAN>上面烧着呢  还是算了
<22-14,RYAN>Yeah, I don't think we wanted to go up anyway.

587
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:42,350
<22-15,ESPOSITO>没有救援我们出不去
<22-15,ESPOSITO>We're not gonna get out without help.

588
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:46,360
<22-15,ESPOSITO>我的手机掉下来的时候坏掉了
<22-15,ESPOSITO>My phone's busted from the fall.

594
00:26:58,430 --> 00:27:00,410
<22-18,RYAN>我们应该让他们知道我们在这下面
<22-18,RYAN>Yeah. We should let them know that we're down here.

602
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:24,310
<22-27,ESPOSITO>也许敲击声会传上去
<22-27,ESPOSITO>Maybe the sound will carry up.

00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,020
<23-6,RYAN>他们听不到的
<23-6,RYAN>They can't hear us.

617
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:18,070
<23-9,ESPOSITO>迟早会被这场火烧光
<23-9,ESPOSITO>sucks all the oxygen out of the room.

618
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,180
<23-10,RYAN>应该有办法  离开这里的
<23-10,RYAN>Gotta be some way... outta here,

619
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:23,700
<23-10,RYAN>还有其他办法让他们知道  我们在这里

628
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:00,950
<24-1,GATES>他们要撤退了是什么意思
<24-1,GATES>What do you mean they're pulling back?

629
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:03,220
<24-2,BECKETT>现场勘察队反映  这个建筑构造很脆弱
<24-2,BECKETT>According to the I.C., the building is structurally

630
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:05,200
<24-2,BECKETT>不适合派队员进去
<24-2,BECKETT>compromised and they can't get their men in.

631
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:06,680
<24-2,BECKETT>他们改变了策略
<24-2,BECKETT>At this point, they don't feel

632
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,860
<24-2,BECKETT>不再进行搜救活动
<24-2,BECKETT>that it's a rescue operation anymore.

633
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,150
<24-2,BECKETT>而是努力防止火势扩散
<24-2,BECKETT>It's a recovery.

634
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:13,160
<24-3,GATES>好吧  探长
<24-3,GATES>Okay, Detective.

639
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:25,090
<25-2,CASTLE>但这里没有任何迹象显示它是下一个目标
<25-2,CASTLE>but there's nothing here to indicate why it was the next target.

640
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:26,070
<25-2,CASTLE>贝克特

652
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:47,580
<25-14,BECKETT>珍妮  你在这里也帮不上忙
<25-14,BECKETT>Jenny, there's nothing you can do here.

<25-15,JENNY>And if he doesn't make it out, if this is it...

655
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:53,310
<25-15,JENNY>我必须待在这里
<25-15,JENNY>I need to be here.

656
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:57,280
<25-16,LANIE>最起码先进救护车里等  好吗
<25-16,LANIE>Let me at least get you inside of an ambulance.

657
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:00,290
<25-16,LANIE>你得躺下  我们才能察看你的情况
<25-16,LANIE>You need to lie down so we can make sure that everything is okay.

658
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:02,300
<25-17,JENNY>好吧  可是等不到他我是不会走的
<25-17,JENNY>Okay, but I'm not leaving without him.

659

661
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:11,400
<25-19,BECKETT>简直像梦一样
<25-19,BECKETT>This is like some kind of a dream.

<25-19,BECKETT>我只希望快点醒来

664
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:19,690
<25-20,CASTLE>我们都无能为力
<25-20,CASTLE>It's like there's nothing we can do.

665
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:22,080
<25-20,CASTLE>我们只能待在这里等待
<25-20,CASTLE>All we can do is be here for them.

<26-3,MILLER>-说不通啊  -怎么
<26-3,MILLER>- Well, this doesn't make any sense. - Why?

688
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,090
<26-5,MILLER>根据这些建筑图纸
<26-5,MILLER>Well, according to these plans,

690
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:29,610
<26-5,MILLER>这栋大楼的地板是浇筑的
<26-5,MILLER>This building has a slab foundation.

691
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:30,920
<26-5,MILLER>根本没有地下室
<26-5,MILLER>There is no basement area.

692
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,190
<26-6,ESPOSITO>我不知道该怎么说
<26-6,ESPOSITO>Well, I don't know what to tell you, pal.

693
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:33,870
<26-6,ESPOSITO>这里就是个地下室
<26-6,ESPOSITO>We're in some kinda basement.

694
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:36,070
<26-6,ESPOSITO>所以那什么破规划肯定有问题
<26-6,ESPOSITO>So there's something wrong with your freakin' plans.

695
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:40,810
<27-1,GATES>他们还活着吗
<27-1,GATES>They're alive?

696
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:43,450
<27-2,CASTLE>是的  但他们被困在了一个未知区域
<27-2,CASTLE>Yeah, but they're in an unmapped portion

697
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:45,130
<27-2,CASTLE>一个下层地下室
<27-2,CASTLE>of the building, a sub-basement.

698
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:47,040
<27-2,CASTLE>消防队员无法进行搜救
<27-2,CASTLE>The--The fire crews can't get to them.

699
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:47,940
<27-2,CASTLE>我们得想办法
<27-2,CASTLE>We need to find them

700
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,490
<27-3,GATES>让他们离开那里
<27-3,GATES>another way out of that room.

701
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:51,300
<27-3,GATES>你觉得有其他办法吗
<27-3,GATES>What makes you think there's another way out?

702
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,940
<27-4,CASTLE>纵火犯安置了炸弹
<27-4,CASTLE>The arsonist set the explosives

703
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,150
<27-4,CASTLE>以防被别人发现
<27-4,CASTLE>to go off to eradicate

704
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:55,850
<27-4,CASTLE>好销毁一切证据
<27-4,CASTLE>all evidence if he was ever found.

705
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:57,320
<27-4,CASTLE>可是如果被发现时
<27-4,CASTLE>But what if someone discovered him

706
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,410
<27-4,CASTLE>他还在楼里没出来呢
<27-4,CASTLE>while he was still in the building?

707
00:31:58,410 --> 00:31:59,600
<27-5,GATES>他会需要一个逃生通道
<27-5,GATES>He'd need a way out.

708
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,160
<27-6,CASTLE>那可能就是下层地下室
<27-6,CASTLE>That could be the reason that sub-basement

709
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,530
<27-6,CASTLE>没有在蓝图上的原因
<27-6,CASTLE>isn't on the building plans.

710
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:04,800
<27-6,CASTLE>我认为纵火犯篡改了蓝图
<27-6,CASTLE>I think the arsonist doctored those plans.

711
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,110
<27-7,GATES>为什么这么认为
<27-7,GATES>What makes you think that?

712
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:07,880
<27-8,CASTLE>莱恩说  在他的工作间里
<27-8,CASTLE>Ryan said when they found the workspace,

713
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,890
<27-8,CASTLE>他发现了一个通风井
<27-8,CASTLE>it was right next to an open air shaft.

714
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:12,740
<27-8,CASTLE>那个通风井直通下层地下室
<27-8,CASTLE>That air shaft ran all the way down to the sub-basement.

715
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:14,200
<27-9,GATES>你认为那是逃生通道吗
<27-9,GATES>You think it's an escape route?

716
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,760
<27-10,CASTLE>如果警察突袭这地方
<27-10,CASTLE>If the cops were to raid this place,

717
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,210
<27-10,CASTLE>他们把前后出口都堵死
<27-10,CASTLE>and they're covering the front and the back

718
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:18,720
<27-10,CASTLE>纵火犯还能往哪儿跑
<27-10,CASTLE>of the building, where's he gonna go?

719
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,340
<27-11,GATES>只能去蓝图上找不到的房间
<27-11,GATES>To the one room that isn't on their plans.

720
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:22,390
<27-12,CASTLE>然后把整栋楼炸掉
<27-12,CASTLE>Then he blows the place,

721
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:23,670
<27-12,CASTLE>里面的人全部被灭口
<27-12,CASTLE>and everyone thinks he's been killed.

722
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:25,330
<27-13,GATES>还有比在烈火中消失更好的
<27-13,GATES>What better way to cover his tracks

723
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:26,930
<27-13,GATES>隐匿踪迹的办法吗
<27-13,GATES>than disappear in a fire.

724
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:29,510
<27-14,CASTLE>这办法只有在那间屋子还有其他出口的情况下才能成功
<27-14,CASTLE>But it only works if there's another way out of that room.

725
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:30,970
<27-15,GATES>而知道出口在哪的人
<27-15,GATES>And the only one to know that

726
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:33,570
<27-16,CASTLE>-只有纵火犯  -我们得找到他
<27-16,CASTLE>- would be our arsonist. - We need to find him.

727
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,460
<27-16,CASTLE>长官
<27-16,CASTLE>Sir?

728
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:36,740
<28-1,TORI>我有新发现
<28-1,TORI>I've got something.

729
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:39,330
<29-1,TORI>我重新检查了一遍"炙爱"网站
<29-1,TORI>I went back through the pyrolicious web site.

730
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:40,880
<29-1,TORI>上面有六段视频是
<29-1,TORI>Six of their videos are of fires

731
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,620
<29-1,TORI>我们要找的纵火犯干的  每段视频的
<29-1,TORI>attributed to our arsonist. Each was uploaded

732
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,880
<29-1,TORI>上传时间都是在这些建筑被烧毁不久之后
<29-1,TORI>to the site shortly after the buildings burned.

733
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,460
<29-1,TORI>但有意思的是
<29-1,TORI>But here's the interesting part.

735
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:49,730
<29-1,TORI>有一个会员  在这些视频
<29-1,TORI>One web site member logged in and viewed

736
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:50,970

737
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:52,820
<29-1,TORI>登陆并观看了它们
<29-1,TORI>just minutes after they were posted.

738
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,530
<29-1,TORI>而且只看了这几个
<29-1,TORI>But only these videos.

739
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,520
<29-1,TORI>就是他
<29-1,TORI>That's him.

740
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,070
<29-2,GATES>他在欣赏他的作品
<29-2,GATES>He's checking out his work.

741
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,860
<29-3,GATES>这个会员叫什么
<29-3,GATES>What's this member's name?

<30-7,GATES>I've got two officers about to burn.

<30-7,GATES>背上谋杀从犯的罪名
<30-7,GATES>as an accessory to murder.

757
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:33,500
<30-8,MILO>有时我们会通过即时通讯软件聊天
<30-8,MILO>We chat sometimes over IM.

758

<30-9,GATES>他跟你聊什么
<30-9,GATES>What would he say?

00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,300
<30-11,GATES>找到他的信息吗

762
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:43,820
<30-12,MILO>没有  有时我会问
<30-12,MILO>No. I'd sometimes ask.

763
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:45,070
<30-12,MILO>但他十分小心
<30-12,MILO>But he was careful.

764
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:46,560
<30-12,MILO>有一次  他的确说了他纵火的原因
<30-12,MILO>He did once say why he did it.

765
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:49,220
<30-12,MILO>他说... 他无法忍受眼睁睁看着它们受折磨
<30-12,MILO>He said he couldn't... deal with the suffering,

766
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:51,600
<30-12,MILO>有时  那些病入膏肓的建筑物们
<30-12,MILO>that sometimes sick and dying buildings

767
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:53,990
<30-12,MILO>需要燃烧  并从痛苦中解脱
<30-12,MILO>need to burn to be put out of their misery.

768
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,590
<31-1,BECKETT>你确定你们没发现任何其它出口
<31-1,BECKETT>And you're sure you don't see another way out?

769
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:03,770
<31-2,RYAN>如果有  也被废墟掩埋了
<31-2,RYAN>If there is, it's covered by debris.

770
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:05,840
<31-2,RYAN>有没有明确点的指示
<31-2,RYAN>Any idea where that way out might be?

771
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,650
<31-3,BECKETT>卡塞尔正在跟建筑部门联系
<31-3,BECKETT>Castle's on the phone with the Building Department.

772
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,760
<31-3,BECKETT>看看能不能拿到原始蓝图
<31-3,BECKETT>He's trying to get ahold of the original blueprints.

773
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,800
<31-4,ESPOSITO>另一个出口的理论完全是我们的推测
<31-4,ESPOSITO>We're assuming there even is a way out.

774
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:14,800
<31-4,ESPOSITO>我们也许太高估这纵火犯了
<31-4,ESPOSITO>We're giving this guy more credit than he deserves.

775
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:18,710
<31-5,RYAN>我俩都开始犯困了
<31-5,RYAN>We're both getting sleepy.

776
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:20,720
<31-5,RYAN>一氧化碳越来越浓
<31-5,RYAN>Carbon monoxide's building up.

777
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:24,950
<31-6,BECKETT>莱恩  你听我说  你得撑住  知道吗
<31-6,BECKETT>Ryan, you listen to me. You need to hang on, okay?

778
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:26,360
<31-6,BECKETT>救援队马上就来了
<31-6,BECKETT>They're coming for you.

779
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:30,290
<31-7,RYAN>感谢你的一番打气  但我们都知道
<31-7,RYAN>I appreciate the pep talk, but we both know

780
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:33,310
<31-7,RYAN>火烧得太厉害了  他们也不知道往哪里搜救
<31-7,RYAN>the fire's too hot. They don't know where to look.

781
00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:34,840
<31-8,BECKETT>不
<31-8,BECKETT>No.

782
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,530
<31-8,BECKETT>莱恩
<31-8,BECKETT>Ryan...

783
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:39,720
<31-9,RYAN>电话线路估计也撑不了多久了
<31-9,RYAN>We're gonna lose the phone soon, Beckett, so...

784
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,520
<31-9,RYAN>有些事  需要你帮我
<31-9,RYAN>There's something I need you to do.

797
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,150
<32-9,RYAN>我去不了了
<32-9,RYAN>I'm not gonna be there.

798
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:19,120
<32-10,JENNY>别那么说
<32-10,JENNY>Don't say that.

799
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:21,650
<32-10,JENNY>求求你  别那么说
<32-10,JENNY>Please, don't say that.

819
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:52,000
<33-1,ESPOSITO>你要给个爱尔兰裔白人孩子起名叫哈维尔
<33-1,ESPOSITO>You're gonna name a white irish kid "Javier"?

820
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,710
<33-2,RYAN>不是吧  你现在要取笑我多愁善感
<33-2,RYAN>What? You're gonna bust on me now for being sentimental?

821
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:57,840
<33-3,ESPOSITO>我觉得这是我最后的机会了
<33-3,ESPOSITO>I figure it's my last chance.

00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:11,130
<33-4,RYAN>不

<33-5,RYAN>Don't you dare, Javi! Javi?!

833
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:46,500
<34-1,JENNY>我不想生  蕾妮
<34-1,JENNY>I don't wanna do this, Lanie.

834
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,810
<34-1,JENNY>我想让他陪我
<34-1,JENNY>Not without him.

835
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:49,550
<34-2,LANIE>我知道  亲爱的
<34-2,LANIE>I know, baby.

836
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:51,940
<34-2,LANIE>我知道  我在这儿  我陪你
<34-2,LANIE>I know, I'm here. I'm here. Mm.

837
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:54,180
<34-2,LANIE>宫缩到间隔两分钟了
<34-2,LANIE>Contractions are two minutes apart.

838
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:55,490
<34-2,LANIE>快生了
<34-2,LANIE>It's coming.

839
00:37:56,660 --> 00:38:00,860
<34-3,LANIE>我们就在这儿生  我陪你  好吗
<34-3,LANIE>And we'll do it here. Together. Okay?

840
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,230
<34-3,LANIE>探长
<34-3,LANIE>Detective.

841
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,790
<34-3,LANIE>我们有发现了
<34-3,LANIE>We may have caught a break.

842
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:11,120
<35-1,BURTON>根据麦罗·帕弗里克所说  纵火犯挑选目标
<35-1,BURTON>According to Milo Pavlik, our arsonist picked his targets

843
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,560
<35-1,BURTON>是因为这些建筑"病入膏肓"
<35-1,BURTON>because the buildings were "sick and dying,"

844
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,410
<35-1,BURTON>而且"需要从痛苦中解脱"
<35-1,BURTON>and "needed to be put out of their misery."

845
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:16,640
<35-1,BURTON>所以我又检查了所有文件
<35-1,BURTON>So, I went back through the files,

846
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:18,340
<35-1,BURTON>所有的建筑检查报告
<35-1,BURTON>all of the building inspector reports,

847
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,500
<35-1,BURTON>发现他是对的
<35-1,BURTON>and he was right.

848
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,830
<35-1,BURTON>每一个目标建筑都有问题
<35-1,BURTON>Each of the targeted buildings had issues--

849
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:25,050
<35-1,BURTON>结构缺陷  线路问题  腐烂
<35-1,BURTON>structural defects, wiring problems, rot.

850
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,720
<35-2,CASTLE>但纵火犯是怎么知道的
<35-2,CASTLE>Okay, but how did our guy know that?

851
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,820
<35-3,BECKETT>他不仅检查了这些建筑
<35-3,BECKETT>He didn't just case the buildings.

852
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,560
<35-3,BECKETT>还在里面待过
<35-3,BECKETT>He spent time inside.

853
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,570
<35-4,BURTON>我想这就是布雷克的发现
<35-4,BURTON>I think that's what Blake discovered,

854
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:34,100
<35-4,BURTON>这是他找到这里的原因
<35-4,BURTON>how he got on to this place.

855
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:36,670
<35-4,BURTON>你们有莱恩和埃斯波西托发现的文件吗
<35-4,BURTON>Do you have those files that Ryan and Esposito found?

856
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:37,830
<35-5,CASTLE>有  在这里
<35-5,CASTLE>Yeah, right here.

857
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,520
<35-6,BURTON>建筑检查报告  谁署名的
<35-6,BURTON>The building inspection reports--who signed them?

858
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:45,060
<35-7,CASTLE>马克·金柏尔
<35-7,CASTLE>Uh, "Mark Kimball."

859
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:48,490
<35-8,BURTON>所有的这些文件  每一个
<35-8,BURTON>All of these files, each one,

860
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:50,350
<35-8,BURTON>他们都有一个共同点
<35-8,BURTON>they have one thing in common--

861
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:52,200
<35-8,BURTON>建筑检查员都是马克·金柏尔
<35-8,BURTON>The building inspector was Mark Kimball.

862
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,840
<35-9,CASTLE>所以他才能进到里面
<35-9,CASTLE>That's how he got inside the buildings,

863
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,940
<35-9,CASTLE>还不被发现  那是他的工作
<35-9,CASTLE>operated without being seen. It was his job.

864
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:58,820
<35-10,BECKETT>这就说明他能进到建筑里
<35-10,BECKETT>Which means he had access to the building department.

865
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:00,990
<35-10,BECKETT>他通过这种方式修改建筑设计
<35-10,BECKETT>That's how he was able to change building plans

866
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:02,420
<35-10,BECKETT>还不被人发现
<35-10,BECKETT>Without anyone knowing.

868
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,540
<35-11,CASTLE>如果他就纵火犯  我们必须找到他
<35-11,CASTLE>If he's the arsonist, we have to find him.

870
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:10,520
<35-12,BECKETT>天呐  他就在现场
<35-12,BECKETT>Oh, god. He's here.

871
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:19,760
<36-1,BECKETT>金柏尔  不许动
<36-1,BECKETT>Kimball! Don't move.

872
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:24,980
<36-2,BECKETT>地下室  有没有出来的方法
<36-2,BECKETT>The basement! Is there a way out?

873
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,090
<36-2,BECKETT>有没有
<36-2,BECKETT>Is there?

874
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:28,460
<36-3,KIMBALL>我不知道你在说什么
<36-3,KIMBALL>I don't know what you're talking about.

875
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:29,960
<36-1,BECKETT>去他的不知道
<36-1,BECKETT>The hell you don't!

876
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,880
<36-2,BECKETT>有没有出来的方法
<36-2,BECKETT>Is there a way out?

877
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,920
<36-4,BECKETT>在里面的人  是我的朋友
<36-4,BECKETT>Those guys in there-- they are my friends.

878
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,790
<36-4,BECKETT>如果他们死了  你跟着陪葬
<36-4,BECKETT>If they die, you die.

879
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:39,230
<36-4,BECKETT>是生是死
<36-4,BECKETT>What's it gonna be?

880
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,110
<36-4,BECKETT>你自己看着办
<36-4,BECKETT>It's your choice.

881
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:27,830
<36-4,BECKETT>看看另一个
<36-4,BECKETT>Check the other one.

882

884
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:52,950
