<5-3,ALEXIS>我在帮你处理私家侦探的案子
<5-3,ALEXIS>I've been working P.I. Cases for you?

128
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,720
<5-4,CASTLE>你肯定是忘了
<5-4,CASTLE>Must have slipped your mind.

129
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:17,510
<5-5,ALEXIS>对了  他们把这里改建得真好啊  是吧
<5-5,ALEXIS>Hey, didn't the guys do a fantastic job remodeling the place?

130
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,070
<5-6,CASTLE>我知道  是吧
<5-6,CASTLE>I know, right?!

131
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,330
<5-6,CASTLE>但你在转移话题
<5-6,CASTLE>But you're changing the subject.

132
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:21,900
<5-7,ALEXIS>我知道  但你看
<5-7,ALEXIS>I know. But check it out.

133
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,550
<5-7,ALEXIS>只要拨一下这本《爱伦·坡小说集》...
<5-7,ALEXIS>Pull on "The complete works of Edgar Allan Poe," and...

134
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:34,940
<5-7,ALEXIS>我的天
<5-7,ALEXIS>Oh, my god!

135
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:37,980
<5-8,CASTLE>这比我想象得酷多了
<5-8,CASTLE>This turned out so much cooler than I thought it would!

136
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:41,670
<5-8,CASTLE>等等  他们有没有在桌上安装....
<5-8,CASTLE>Wait, did they do the thing on the desk with the...?

137
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:53,070
<5-10,CASTLE>显然弹簧是有轨迹的
<5-10,CASTLE>Obviously the spring has a trajectory --

138
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,530
<5-10,CASTLE>我会...好了  说回到你
<5-10,CASTLE>I'll make the -- okay, back to you.

139
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:56,450
<5-10,CASTLE>你为啥  为啥要调查我的案子
<5-10,CASTLE>Why -- why are you working my cases?

140
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:58,300
<5-11,ALEXIS>事实上  都是你的错
<5-11,ALEXIS>Truth is, it's all your fault.

141
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,700
<5-12,CASTLE>你背着我在我办公室当起了老板
<5-12,CASTLE>You set up shop in my office behind my back,

142
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,820
<5-12,CASTLE>-结果还是我的错  -没错
<5-12,CASTLE>- and it's my fault? - Exactly.

143
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,190
<5-13,ALEXIS>一个月前  你让我来帮你的工头开门
<5-13,ALEXIS>A month ago, when you sent me here to open the place for your foreman,

144
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,670
<5-13,ALEXIS>正好来了个潜在的客户
<5-13,ALEXIS>a potential client came by.

145
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:09,070
<5-13,ALEXIS>我起了好奇心  所以我就说我是你助手
<5-13,ALEXIS>I was intrigued, so I sort of said I was your associate,

146
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,500
<5-13,ALEXIS>然后我就不小心破了那案子
<5-13,ALEXIS>And then I kind of solved the case.

147
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,160
<5-13,ALEXIS>从那之后  我已经又结了三个案子了
<5-13,ALEXIS>Since then, I've closed three others.

148
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,140
<5-14,CASTLE>阿里克西斯  你不能...你结了四个案子
<5-14,CASTLE>Alexis, you can't just -- you closed four cases?

149
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,600
<5-14,CASTLE>居然比我结的还多
<5-14,CASTLE>That's more than I have.

150
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,470
<5-15,ALEXIS>我知道  你得提高水平了
<5-15,ALEXIS>I know. Step your game up.

151
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:20,240
<5-16,CASTLE>那你的大学课程怎么办
<5-16,CASTLE>W-what about your college courses?

152
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,850
<5-17,ALEXIS>拜托  我应付得来
<5-17,ALEXIS>Oh, please. I've got that handled.

153
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:23,050
<5-17,ALEXIS>而且  我伪造了你的签名
<5-17,ALEXIS>Plus, I forged your signature

154
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:25,360
<5-17,ALEXIS>可以凭做实习生拿到学分
<5-17,ALEXIS>to make sure I got school credit for being an intern.

155
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:27,440
<5-18,CASTLE>是埃斯波西托  我得接
<5-18,CASTLE>Okay, that's Esposito. I have to take this.

156
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,070
<5-18,CASTLE>不过你的事可还没说完
<5-18,CASTLE>But we are not done talking.

157
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,150
<5-19,ALEXIS>很好  我们得讨论下
<5-19,ALEXIS>Good, we need to discuss

158
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,850
<5-19,ALEXIS>我在公司的红利分成
<5-19,ALEXIS>my profit participation in the company.

159
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:33,880
<5-20,ESPOSITO>-卡塞尔  -埃斯波西托
<5-20,ESPOSITO>- Castle? - UH, E-Esposito.

160
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,500
<5-21,CASTLE>还好吗  伙计  新女上司对你怎么样
<5-21,CASTLE>How you doing, buddy? How's the new boss lady treating you?

161
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,420
<5-22,ESPOSITO>她在无视我
<5-22,ESPOSITO>She's ignoring me.

162
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,750
<5-23,RYAN>就跟他生命中的其他女人一样
<5-23,RYAN>Just like every other woman in his life.

163
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,460
<5-24,ESPOSITO>闭嘴
<5-24,ESPOSITO>Shut up.

164
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,190
<5-24,ESPOSITO>总之  你老婆没接电话
<5-24,ESPOSITO>So, your wife is not answering her cell,

165
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:44,800
<5-24,ESPOSITO>我们需要她多派点警员过来
<5-24,ESPOSITO>and we need her authorization for more officers down here.

166
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:45,950
<5-24,ESPOSITO>-她跟你在一起吗  -抱歉
<5-24,ESPOSITO>- Is she with you? - Oh, I'm sorry.

167
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:48,370
<5-25,CASTLE>她去总局开会了  出什么事了
<5-25,CASTLE>She's at a meeting at 1pp. What's going on?

168
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,840
<5-26,RYAN>我们在办一个案子  有兴趣吗
<5-26,RYAN>We're working on a case. You interested?

169
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,210
<5-27,CASTLE>我也想  可我这蒸蒸日上的
<5-27,CASTLE>I'd love to, but I'm a little busy

170
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,240
<5-27,CASTLE>私家侦探业务有点忙
<5-27,CASTLE>with my thriving P.I. Business.

171
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,000
<5-28,ALEXIS>并没有  我把案子都结了
<5-28,ALEXIS>Not really. I closed all the cases.

172
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,240
<5-29,CASTLE>不过既然你们需要人  我就忙里抽闲...
<5-29,CASTLE>But since you're desperate, I'll rearrange my hectic schedule...

173
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,120
<5-29,CASTLE>帮你们参谋参谋吧
<5-29,CASTLE>...and, uh, lend you my expertise.

174
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:01,180
<5-29,CASTLE>拜托
<5-29,CASTLE>Come on.

175
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,840
<6-1,CASTLE>这就像昆汀·塔伦蒂诺的电影成真了
<6-1,CASTLE>Looks like a tarantino film came to life in here.

176
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:15,150
<6-2,RYAN>是啊  见见主演吧  这是格雷格·米诺索
<6-2,RYAN>Yeah. Now meet our stars. This is Greg Minoso.

177
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,170
<6-2,RYAN>这边是杰克·菲兹
<6-2,RYAN>Over here, we got Jake Fitz.

178
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,470
<6-2,RYAN>最后  这是达斯汀·钱伯斯
<6-2,RYAN>And finally, we come to Dustin Chambers.

179
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:24,860
<6-3,ESPOSITO>还有  他们都带着一样的40口径枪
<6-3,ESPOSITO>And check this out. They were each packing identical .40 cals.

180
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,650
<6-4,CASTLE>我猜他们不是装修队的
<6-4,CASTLE>I take it they weren't part of the construction crew.

181
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:28,930
<6-5,RYAN>对  按计划  装修要下周才开始
<6-5,RYAN>No. Renovation's not scheduled to begin till next week.

182
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:31,590
<6-6,CASTLE>好吧  那到底发生了什么
<6-6,CASTLE>Okay. So, what happened?

183
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:32,930
<6-7,ESPOSITO>其实  我们也还不知道
<6-7,ESPOSITO>Truth is, we're not sure yet.

184
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:36,330
<6-8,RYAN>我们只知道上午9:07分有人听到了枪声
<6-8,RYAN>What we do know is that gunfire was heard around 9:07 a.m.

185
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,990
<6-8,RYAN>持续了一两分钟左右
<6-8,RYAN>And continued for a minute or two.

186
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,130
<6-9,CASTLE>所以他们是自相残杀的
<6-9,CASTLE>So they shot each other?

187
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:41,750
<6-10,LANIE PARISH>不  他们的伤口角度是向下的
<6-10,LANIE PARISH>Nope, their wounds are from a downward angle,

188
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,150
<6-10,LANIE PARISH>大概45度左右
<6-10,LANIE PARISH>Maybe 45 degrees,

189
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:45,890
<6-10,LANIE PARISH>也就是说枪击可能均来自那上边
<6-10,LANIE PARISH>which means they probably all were shot from up there.

190
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,800
<7-1,LANIE>没错了  枪手绝对是在这上边的
<7-1,LANIE>Yep. The shooter was definitely up here.

191
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,770
<7-2,RYAN>9毫米口径的
<7-2,RYAN>9 millimeter.

192
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,010
<7-2,RYAN>好吧
<7-2,RYAN>All right.

193
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,240
<7-3,ESPOSITO>他在这里对他们开了枪
<7-3,ESPOSITO>Must have capped them from up here,

194
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,530
<7-3,ESPOSITO>砰  砰  砰  然后从那个出口逃走了
<7-3,ESPOSITO>Boom, boom, boom, and then boogied out that exit.

195
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,930
<7-4,CASTLE>伙计们
<7-4,CASTLE>Ew. Guys.

196
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:12,520
<7-5,CASTLE>看来枪手也被死者打中了
<7-5,CASTLE>Looks like our shooter took a bullet from one of the dead guys down there,

197
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,130
<7-6,RYAN>靠着墙倒下了  抓着罩单
<7-6,RYAN>Falls back up against the wall, grabbing the drop cloth,

198
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,290
<7-6,RYAN>给顺手扯下来了
<7-6,RYAN>pulling it down with him.

199
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:18,810
<7-7,ESPOSITO>跟医院联系一下  看有没有人
<7-7,ESPOSITO>Let's contact hospitals, see if anybody came in...

201
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,360
<7-8,CASTLE>这是贝克特的
<7-8,CASTLE>This is Beckett's.

202
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,780
<7-9,LANIE>等等  你刚才说什么
<7-9,LANIE>Wait. What did you just say?

203
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,500
<7-10,CASTLE>我今天早晨给她的
<7-10,CASTLE>I gave it to her this morning.

204
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:33,530
<7-10,CASTLE>她来过这
<7-10,CASTLE>She was here.

215
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,300
<8-1,CASTLE>告诉我
<8-1,CASTLE>Tell me.

216
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:03,340
<8-2,ESPOSITO>蕾妮说那是贝克特的血
<8-2,ESPOSITO>Lanie said that blood was a match to Beckett's.

217
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:06,040
<8-3,CASTLE>那里有好多血啊
<8-3,CASTLE>But there was so much blood.

218
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:07,790
<8-3,CASTLE>好吧
<8-3,CASTLE>O-okay.

219
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:11,030
<8-3,CASTLE>好吧  不过这可是贝克特
<8-3,CASTLE>Okay, but this is... this is Beckett we're talking about.

220
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,370
<8-4,ESPOSITO>是的  是的  她很坚强
<8-4,ESPOSITO>Yeah, yeah. She's as tough as they come.

221
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:15,360
<8-5,CASTLE>没错  所以说她一定是打死了那三个人
<8-5,CASTLE>Exactly. So, she must have shot those three guys.

222
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:16,720
<8-5,CASTLE>可既然她没有联系咱们
<8-5,CASTLE>And since she hasn't contacted us,

223
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,820
<8-5,CASTLE>可以假定是他们的同伴绑架了她
<8-5,CASTLE>we can assume that their partners abducted her.

224
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:19,480
<8-5,CASTLE>可是为什么呢
<8-5,CASTLE>But why?

225
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,570
<8-5,CASTLE>我们要查一下这些死掉枪手的背景
<8-5,CASTLE>We need to dig into the backgrounds of those dead shooters.

226
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:23,310
<8-5,CASTLE>找出他们的同伙是谁
<8-5,CASTLE>We need to find out who they're working with.

227
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:26,410
<8-6,ESPOSITO>问题就在这  查不到  他们的证件是假的
<8-6,ESPOSITO>That's the thing. We can't. Their I.D.s are all fake.

228
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:27,670
<8-6,ESPOSITO>而且系统里也查不到他们的指纹
<8-6,ESPOSITO>And their prints aren't in the system.

229
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:30,500
<8-6,ESPOSITO>卡塞尔  你知道贝克特去剧院干什么吗
<8-6,ESPOSITO>Castle, do you have any idea what Beckett was doing at that theater?

230
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,120
<8-7,CASTLE>她本该去总局的
<8-7,CASTLE>She was supposed to be at 1PP.

231
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,360
<8-8,ESPOSITO>我跟盖茨谈过了
<8-8,ESPOSITO>I talked to Gates.

232
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:35,390
<8-8,ESPOSITO>根本没有贝克特的预约
<8-8,ESPOSITO>Beckett didn't have anything on the books.

233
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,720
<8-9,CASTLE>这么说她骗了我
<8-9,CASTLE>So she lied to me?

234
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,130
<8-10,RYAN>伙计们  我查到了其中一个死者的信用卡
<8-10,RYAN>Guys, I got a hit on one of the dead shooter's credit cards.

235
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:42,860
<8-10,RYAN>他在一个网站上租了一个短期公寓
<8-10,RYAN>He rented a short-term apartment through an online site.

236
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,170
<9-1,RYAN>纽约警局
<9-1,RYAN>NYPD!

237
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,160
<9-2,ESPOSITO>莱恩  有个死角
<9-2,ESPOSITO>Ryan, I got dead space.

238
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,350
<9-3,RYAN>卡塞尔  待在那别动
<9-3,RYAN>Castle, stay put.

239
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,450
<9-1,RYAN>纽约警局
<9-1,RYAN>NYPD!

240
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:16,250
<9-5,CASTLE>等等
<9-5,CASTLE>Wait!

241
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,450
<9-5,CASTLE>她在哪
<9-5,CASTLE>Where is she?!

242
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:18,550
<9-6,CASTLE>贝克特在哪
<9-6,CASTLE>Where's Beckett?

243
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,430
<9-8,RYAN>-纽约警局  别动  -马上趴下
<9-8,RYAN>- NYPD! Don't move! - Get on the floor right now!

244
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:26,090
<9-9,ESPOSITO>-趴下  -快趴下
<9-9,ESPOSITO>- On the ground! - On the floor right now!

245
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:27,910
<9-11,HAYLEY SHIPTON>你们看到地上什么样了吗
<9-11,HAYLEY SHIPTON>Have you seen the floor?

246
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:30,640
<9-11,HAYLEY SHIPTON>你们如果不介意  我还是站着吧
<9-11,HAYLEY SHIPTON>If it's all the same to you, boys, let's do the standing.

247
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,690
<10-1,ESPOSITO>坐吧  希普顿小姐
<10-1,ESPOSITO>Have a seat, Miss Shipton.

248
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:48,390
<10-2,HAYLEY>别这么称呼我  叫我海莉
<10-2,HAYLEY>Oh, no, please, call my Hayley.

249
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:51,110
<10-2,HAYLEY>我让所有摸过我的人都叫我的教名
<10-2,HAYLEY>I insist that anyone who's frisked me use my given name.

250
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,990
<10-2,HAYLEY>好吧  海莉  我搭档和我非常喜欢
<10-2,HAYLEY>Okay, Hayley, my partner and I really enjoyed

<10-2,HAYLEY>reading your file.

252

<11-1,ESPOSITO>亲爱的  我可不止上面写的那样
<11-1,ESPOSITO>Oh, sweetie, I'm so much more than words on paper.

253
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:00,090
<11-2,HAYLEY>从小在伦敦东区长大
<11-2,HAYLEY>Born and raised in east London,

254
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:02,020
<11-3,RYAN>哈克尼区
<11-3,RYAN>over in the borough of Hackney.

255
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:02,950
<11-4,ESPOSITO>那里治安不怎么好
<11-4,ESPOSITO>Rough area.

256
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:05,350
<11-4,ESPOSITO>那里不是有条街叫"一英里谋杀街"吗
<11-4,ESPOSITO>Don't they have a street nicknamed "The murder mile"?

257
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,720
<11-5,HAYLEY>是啊  但也有些风情的
<11-5,HAYLEY>Well, yes. But it's not without its charms.

258
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,890
<11-6,RYAN>和你一样  顺说  我喜欢你的口音
<11-6,RYAN>Just like you. Love your accent, by the way.

259
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:11,390
<11-6,RYAN>很时髦
<11-6,RYAN>Very posh.

260
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:12,530
<11-6,RYAN>你在哪学会的
<11-6,RYAN>Where did you learn to speak like that?

261
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:13,800
<11-7,ESPOSITO>肯定不是在她小时候生活的贫民窟里
<11-7,ESPOSITO>Not from the slums she grew up in.

262
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,060
<11-7,ESPOSITO>而且也绝对不是从你妈妈那学的
<11-7,ESPOSITO>And definitely not from your mom,

263
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,920
<11-7,ESPOSITO>她被判了20年  快刑满了
<11-7,ESPOSITO>who's at the tail end of a 20-year prison bid.

264
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,670
<11-8,RYAN>不想步妈妈的后尘
<11-8,RYAN>Oh, then not wanting to follow in mum's footsteps,

265
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:21,890
<11-8,RYAN>于是加入了伦敦警察厅
<11-8,RYAN>you joined the Metropolitan Police Service.

266
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:23,570
<11-9,ESPOSITO>-结果干得很失败  -是的  他们把你解雇了
<11-9,ESPOSITO>- And that was an epic fail. - Yeah, they booted you out

267
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:25,650
<11-10,RYAN>因为你喜欢钻法律的空子
<11-10,RYAN>because of your tendency to cut legal corners.

268
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:26,500
<11-11,HAYLEY>并没有证据
<11-11,HAYLEY>Allegedly.

269
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,710
<11-12,RYAN>你为了让一个毒贩子招供
<11-12,RYAN>You hung a dealer out of a window

270
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,070
<11-12,RYAN>就把他挂在窗外
<11-12,RYAN>in order to get a confession?

271
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:30,770
<11-13,HAYLEY>我是把他挂在窗外
<11-13,HAYLEY>Did I hang him out the window?

272
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:33,240
<11-13,HAYLEY>还是我把他从窗外救上来了呢
<11-13,HAYLEY>Or did I save him from falling out said window?

273
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,290
<11-13,HAYLEY>这很难说  也很难证明
<11-13,HAYLEY>It's hard to tell. It's even harder to prove.

274
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:36,770
<11-14,RYAN>我们很幸运  不用去证明
<11-14,RYAN>Well, lucky for us, we don't have to prove

275
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:37,990
<11-14,RYAN>你躲在那个公寓里
<11-14,RYAN>that you were hiding in that apartment.

276
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,080
<11-15,HAYLEY>躲  不是  是迷路了
<11-15,HAYLEY>Hiding? No. Lost.

277
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:42,160
<11-15,HAYLEY>其实我当时是在找星巴克
<11-15,HAYLEY>I was looking for a Starbucks, actually.

278
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:44,090
<11-15,HAYLEY>通常是很容易找到的
<11-15,HAYLEY>Usually they're so easy to find.

279
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:46,090
<11-16,ESPOSITO>你怎么认识租了那间公寓的人
<11-16,ESPOSITO>How do you know the guy who rented that apartment?

280
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,720
<11-17,HAYLEY>不像以前坐在这张椅子上的那些傻蛋们
<11-17,HAYLEY>Unlike the imbeciles who usually sit in this chair,

281
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,450
<11-17,HAYLEY>我知道自己的权利  所以我要走了
<11-17,HAYLEY>I know my rights, so I would like to leave now.

282
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:53,590
<11-18,ESPOSITO>不行  我不同意
<11-18,ESPOSITO>No. I don't think so.

283
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:56,310
<11-19,RYAN>纽约警局的一名警监失踪了  还死了三个人
<11-19,RYAN>We got a missing NYPD captain, as well as three dead bodies,

284
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:57,830
<11-19,RYAN>所以你赶紧交代吧
<11-19,RYAN>So you should start talking right now.

285
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,100
<11-20,HAYLEY>我不知道什么...
<11-20,HAYLEY>I don't know anything...

286
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,770
<11-21,ESPOSITO>拜托  海莉  别装了
<11-21,ESPOSITO>Hey, come on, Hayley. You can do better than that.

287

<11-22,HAYLEY>我是个自由职业的安保专家
<11-22,HAYLEY>Look, I am just a freelance security specialist.

288
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:06,280
<11-22,HAYLEY>有家保险公司雇我去抓一名黑客
<11-22,HAYLEY>I was hired by an insurance company to catch a hacker

289
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,580
<11-22,HAYLEY>此人一直在从他们公司的系统中盗取社保号码
<11-22,HAYLEY>who's been stealing social-security numbers from their system.

290
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,080
<12-1,RYAN>你为什么出现在那间公寓里
<12-1,RYAN>Why were you in that apartment?

00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,690
<12-2,HAYLEY>我在追查那些

358
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:04,050
<16-2,ESPOSITO>已经查了  一次性电话打来的
<16-2,ESPOSITO>Already checked. Call came from a burner phone.

359
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:05,950
<16-2,ESPOSITO>该死  好吧
<16-2,ESPOSITO>Oh, damn it. All right.

360
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,820
<16-3,CASTLE>她肯定是在剧院见了这个人
<16-3,CASTLE>She must have met this guy at the theater.

361
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,610
<16-3,CASTLE>显然他们中了埋伏  贝克特中了枪
<16-3,CASTLE>Clearly they were ambushed. Beckett gets shot.

362
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,360
<16-3,CASTLE>但她干掉了对方的三个人
<16-3,CASTLE>But she manages to take three of them out,

363
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:14,670
<16-3,CASTLE>然后和这个人逃走了
<16-3,CASTLE>and then she and the man escape.

364
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:15,850
<16-4,ESPOSITO>但她没有向警局求援
<16-4,ESPOSITO>But she didn't call for backup.

365
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:18,140
<16-5,RYAN>对啊  她为什么不联系我们
<16-5,RYAN>Yeah. Why wouldn't she reach out to us?

366
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,690
<16-6,CASTLE>两位  她可是用针线
<16-6,CASTLE>Guys, the woman just sewed herself up

367
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:20,620
<16-6,CASTLE>缝了伤口
<16-6,CASTLE>with a needle and thread.

368
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,580
<16-6,CASTLE>明显是有重大隐情
<16-6,CASTLE>Clearly something's going on,

369
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,910
<16-6,CASTLE>而且她不敢联系任何人
<16-6,CASTLE>and she's afraid to contact anyone.

370
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:24,490
<16-7,RYAN>但是什么隐情呢  什么事能
<16-7,RYAN>But what? I me-- I mean, what could it be

371
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:25,700
<16-7,RYAN>让她做出这种事来呢
<16-7,RYAN>that would cause her to react like this?

372
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,900
<16-8,CASTLE>不管是什么  肯定都和这个人有关
<16-8,CASTLE>Whatever it is, it has to do with this man.

373
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:30,060
<16-8,CASTLE>找到神秘人  就能找到贝克特
<16-8,CASTLE>We find the man, we find Beckett.

374
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,640
<16-9,RYAN>好吧  我去找鉴证组在这里搜取指纹
<16-9,RYAN>All right, I'll have CSU dust this place for prints.

375
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,080
<16-9,RYAN>-也许能确认神秘人的身份  -好
<16-9,RYAN>- Maybe we get an I.D. on this guy. - Right.

376
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,610
<16-11,ESPOSITO>我送干洗店老板去见画像师
<16-11,ESPOSITO>I'll get the dry-cleaner to sit with a sketch artist.

377
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:38,470
<16-12,CASTLE>阿丽克西斯  听我说
<16-12,CASTLE>Hey, Alexis, listen, somet--

378
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:40,430
<16-13,ALEXIS>爸爸  赶紧回办公室来
<16-13,ALEXIS>Dad, come back to the office now.

379
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:41,560
<16-14,CASTLE>怎么了
<16-14,CASTLE>What's going on?

380
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,700
<16-15,ALEXIS>赶快回来吧  别带别人
<16-15,ALEXIS>Just hurry. And come alone.

381
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:44,550
<16-15,ALEXIS>好
<16-15,ALEXIS>Right.

382
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:45,890
<16-16,CASTLE>警局见了
<16-16,CASTLE>Uh, I'll -- I'll meet you back at the station.

383
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:46,840
<16-17,ESPOSITO>好
<16-17,ESPOSITO>All right.

384
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:49,480
<17-1,CASTLE>阿丽克西斯
<17-1,CASTLE>Alexis?

385
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,820
<17-2,ALEXIS>爸爸  我们在里面
<17-2,ALEXIS>Dad, we're in here.

386
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,500
<17-3,CASTLE>我们
<17-3,CASTLE>"We"?

388
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,790
<17-6,HAYLEY>-就是这样  没错  -真的吗
<17-6,HAYLEY>- That's it. That is it. - Yeah?

389
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:58,300
<17-7,CASTLE>-真的  -这是怎么回事
<17-7,CASTLE>- Yes. Okay. - What the hell's going on here?

390
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,380
<17-8,HAYLEY>希望你不介意
<17-8,HAYLEY>Oh, I hope you don't mind.

391
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,710
<17-8,HAYLEY>我只是教她些私家侦探的技巧
<17-8,HAYLEY>I'm just giving her some P.I. lessons.

392
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:02,880
<17-9,ALEXIS>海莉在教我操纵男人的技巧
<17-9,ALEXIS>Hayley was teaching me the art of manipulating men.

393
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,330
<17-9,ALEXIS>重点是自信和眼神接触
<17-9,ALEXIS>It's all about confidence and eye contact.

394
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:06,260
<17-10,HAYLEY>如果你用眼神就能诱惑一个男人
<17-10,HAYLEY>Yeah, if you can entice a man with your gaze,

395
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,820
<17-10,HAYLEY>你就能撒谎  偷东西  出轨 诸如此类
<17-10,HAYLEY>You can lie, steal, cheat, what have you.

396
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:10,370
<17-11,CASTLE>我妻子还在努力求生
<17-11,CASTLE>My wife is out there fighting for her life.

397
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:12,150
<17-11,CASTLE>你为什么要浪费我的时间
<17-11,CASTLE>Why are you wasting my time?

398
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:14,380
<17-12,ALEXIS>什么  你怎么不告诉我
<17-12,ALEXIS>Wait, what? Why didn't you tell me?

399
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,600
<17-13,HAYLEY>抱歉  我觉得不应该由我来告诉你
<17-13,HAYLEY>Sorry. I figured it wasn't my place.

400
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:19,700
<17-13,HAYLEY>里克  你之前求我帮忙  现在还需要吗
<17-13,HAYLEY>Now, look, Rick. You asked for my help. You want it or not?

401
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,340
<17-14,CASTLE>有什么条件
<17-14,CASTLE>What's the catch?

402
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,720
<17-14,CASTLE>因为我觉得和你做事  总会有条件的
<17-14,CASTLE>Cause I'm thinking, with you, there's always a catch.

403
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,990
<17-15,HAYLEY>只有一条  不带警察
<17-15,HAYLEY>There's only one -- no cops.

404
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:26,910
<17-16,CASTLE>-为什么不  -目的不同
<17-16,CASTLE>- Why not? - Differing agendas.

405
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:28,050
<17-17,HAYLEY>警察服务和保卫这座城市
<17-17,HAYLEY>The cops serve and protect the city.

406
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:29,690
<17-17,HAYLEY>我服务和保卫自己
<17-17,HAYLEY>I serve and protect me.

407
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,640
<17-18,CASTLE>好  不带警察
<17-18,CASTLE>Fine. No cops.

408
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,750
<17-19,ALEXIS>爸爸  贝克特怎么了
<17-19,ALEXIS>Dad. What happened to Beckett?

409
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,390
<17-20,CASTLE>她受伤了  并且正在逃亡
<17-20,CASTLE>She's hurt, and she's on the run.

410
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,290
<17-21,ALEXIS>为了躲谁
<17-21,ALEXIS>From whom?

411
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:42,530
<17-22,CASTLE>我不知道  这跟和她在一起的男人有关系
<17-22,CASTLE>I don't know. It has something to do with a man she's with.

412
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:43,550
<17-23,HAYLEY>什么男人
<17-23,HAYLEY>What man?

413
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,730
<17-23,HAYLEY>我在这不是吗  你得付出才有回报
<17-23,HAYLEY>Look, I'm here, aren't I? You've got to give to get.

414
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,180
<17-23,HAYLEY>这个神秘男子是谁
<17-23,HAYLEY>Who's this mystery man?

415
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:53,470
<17-24,CASTLE>他是东印人  将近30岁  他可能生病了
<17-24,CASTLE>He's east Indian, in his late 20s. He might be sick.

416
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:56,640
<17-24,CASTLE>他头晕  头疼  说他需要吃点东西
<17-24,CASTLE>He was dizzy, had a headache, said he needed something to eat.

417
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,040
<17-24,CASTLE>我不知道  你知道什么  海莉
<17-24,CASTLE>I don't know. What about you, Hayley?

418
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,970
<17-24,CASTLE>我知道你有事没有告诉我们
<17-24,CASTLE>I know you're holding back on something.

419
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:03,190
<17-25,HAYLEY>我有关于剩下两个枪手的线索
<17-25,HAYLEY>I have a lead on the last two shooters.

420
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:04,970
<17-26,CASTLE>怎么找到的
<17-26,CASTLE>How?

421
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:09,060
<17-27,HAYLEY>我不是仅仅在追踪随机的假身份
<17-27,HAYLEY>Well, I haven't just been chasing random identities.

422
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:11,610
<17-27,HAYLEY>一个黑客偷了十万个社保账号
<17-27,HAYLEY>A hacker stole 100,000 social-security numbers,

423
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,530
<17-27,HAYLEY>再把它们分为一个个小组
<17-27,HAYLEY>then bundled them into smaller groupings.

424
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:15,210
<17-28,CASTLE>他把这些社保账号卖给谁
<17-28,CASTLE>And who's he selling the bundles to?

425
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:17,700
<17-29,HAYLEY>黑手党  毒枭  恐怖分子  任君挑选
<17-29,HAYLEY>Mafia, drug cartels, terrorists. Take your pick.

426
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:19,860
<17-29,HAYLEY>然而  从这一组五名枪手中
<17-29,HAYLEY>However, from the bundle of those five shooters,

427
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:22,630
<17-29,HAYLEY>我发现他们刚使用了一个新的身份
<17-29,HAYLEY>I've just uncovered that a new identity's been used.

428
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,050
<17-30,CASTLE>你能追踪它吗
<17-30,CASTLE>Can you track it?

429
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:25,260
<17-31,HAYLEY>我已经追踪了
<17-31,HAYLEY>I already have.

430
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,800
<17-31,HAYLEY>几天以前有人用它租了一个储藏柜
<17-31,HAYLEY>It was used to lease a storage locker a few days ago.

431
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:30,140
<17-32,CASTLE>这怎么能帮我找到贝克特
<17-32,CASTLE>And how does this help me find Beckett?

432
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:33,950
<17-33,HAYLEY>不能  但现在仍然有两个杀手在找她
<17-33,HAYLEY>It doesn't, but there are still two killers hunting her.

433
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:35,100
<17-33,HAYLEY>如果我们能找到他们
<17-33,HAYLEY>If we can track them down,

434
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,840
<17-33,HAYLEY>我离找到我的黑客更进一步
<17-33,HAYLEY>I get one step closer to my hacker,

435
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,060
<17-33,HAYLEY>你也能救出你妻子
<17-33,HAYLEY>and you get your wife out of harm's way.

436
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,990
<17-33,HAYLEY>这样  我们各取所需
<17-33,HAYLEY>This way, we both get what we want.

437
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:43,290
<17-34,CASTLE>好  我们走
<17-34,CASTLE>All right. Let's go.

438
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:46,330
<17-35,ALEXIS>爸爸  你在干洗店有没有注意到
<17-35,ALEXIS>Dad, did you notice any candy wrappers or fruit juice,

439
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:48,110
<17-35,ALEXIS>糖纸  果汁  任何含糖的东西吗
<17-35,ALEXIS>anything with sugar, at the dry-cleaner's?

440
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:49,920
<17-36,CASTLE>有一个空苏打罐子  怎么了
<17-36,CASTLE>Uh, an empty soda can. Why?

441
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,380
<17-37,ALEXIS>我觉得和贝克特在一起的神秘男子
<17-37,ALEXIS>I think Beckett's mystery man might have been having

442
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:52,520
<17-37,ALEXIS>可能糖尿病发病了
<17-37,ALEXIS>a diabetic incident.

443
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,530
<17-37,ALEXIS>但是根据他的症状  糖分仍然不够
<17-37,ALEXIS>But based on his symptoms, sugar is not enough.

444
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:56,690
<17-38,CASTLE>-他需要胰岛素来  -亲爱的  我得走了
<17-38,CASTLE>- He'll need insulin to regulate -- - honey, I need to go.

445
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:58,760
<17-38,CASTLE>我们一会再说这个  好吗
<17-38,CASTLE>Let's talk about this later, though, okay?

446
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,440
<17-39,HAYLEY>红发妞  别等着你老爸
<17-39,HAYLEY>Red, don't wait for the old man.

447
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,130
<17-39,HAYLEY>如果你找到了什么  继续查下去
<17-39,HAYLEY>If you've got something, follow up on it.

448
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:04,950
<17-39,HAYLEY>贝克特在逃亡
<17-39,HAYLEY>Look, Beckett's on the run.

449
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:06,590
<17-39,HAYLEY>她不能去找医生  不能去医院
<17-39,HAYLEY>She can't go to a doctor, can't go to a hospital,

450
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:08,460
<17-39,HAYLEY>那她怎么去弄胰岛素呢
<17-39,HAYLEY>So how does she get her hands on insulin?

451
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:09,900
<17-40,ALEXIS>她得想别的办法
<17-40,ALEXIS>She would have to get creative.

452
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:10,980
<17-41,HAYLEY>这就对了
<17-41,HAYLEY>There you go.

453
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,920
<18-1,CASTLE>为什么要在后门停车
<18-1,CASTLE>Why did we park back here?

454
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,950
<18-1,CASTLE>海莉  我们可以直接从前门进去
<18-1,CASTLE>Hayley, we can just walk straight through the front door.

455
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:24,350
<18-1,CASTLE>那用不着断线钳
<18-1,CASTLE>There's no bolt cutters required.

456
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:27,300
<18-2,HAYLEY>你扮演警察的时间太长了  里克
<18-2,HAYLEY>Oh, you've been playing at being a cop too long, Rick.

457
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,390
<18-2,HAYLEY>作为一个私家侦探  你没有警徽  没有搜查令
<18-2,HAYLEY>As a P.I., you don't have a badge, don't have search warrants.

458
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:32,370
<18-2,HAYLEY>你必须得想别的办法  撒谎  骗人
<18-2,HAYLEY>You've got to get creative, lie, cheat.

459
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:33,960
<18-3,CASTLE>偶尔非法入侵一下  对吧
<18-3,CASTLE>And the occasional b&e, apparently?

460
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:35,820
<18-4,HAYLEY>是啊  如果必须的话
<18-4,HAYLEY>Yeah, if that's what it takes.

461
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,260
<18-4,HAYLEY>那么  你要怎么做
<18-4,HAYLEY>So, what's it gonna be?

462
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:41,670
<18-4,HAYLEY>这就对了
<18-4,HAYLEY>Yeah.

464
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:04,070
<18-4,HAYLEY>我叫阿  斯特赖克  克拉拉·斯特赖克
<18-4,HAYLEY>Hi. My name's Ale-- Stryker. Clara Stryker.

<19-1,ALEXIS>I'm an auditor with emergency services.

466
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,650
<19-2,PARAMEDIC RAUCH>我能为你做什么  斯特赖克小姐
<19-2,PARAMEDIC RAUCH>Um...what can I do for you, Ms. Stryker?

467
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:10,250
<19-3,ALEXIS>我正在调查一通911假警报
<19-3,ALEXIS>I'm looking into a bogus 911 call

468
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,980
<19-3,ALEXIS>从第2大街和第23大街的交界处的干洗店打来的
<19-3,ALEXIS>made near a dry-ceaner's on 2nd and 23rd street.

469
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:16,040
<19-4,RAUCH>对  我们报告为恶作剧
<19-4,RAUCH>Yeah. Uh, right. We reported that as a prank.

470
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,690
<19-5,ALEXIS>我确定你事后进行了完整的盘点
<19-5,ALEXIS>Then I'm sure you performed a complete inventory afterward.

471
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:22,860
<19-6,ALEXIS>我就当做你不知道你要这么做
<19-6,ALEXIS>I take it you didn't know you needed to?

472
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:25,070
<19-6,ALEXIS>别担心  我们可以现在做
<19-6,ALEXIS>Don't worry. We can do it now.

473
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:28,320
<19-7,RAUCH>斯特赖克小姐  我只是一个试用的急救员
<19-7,RAUCH>Look, Ms. Stryker, I'm just a probationary E.M.T.

474
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,240
<19-7,RAUCH>我的主管很快就要回来了
<19-7,RAUCH>My supervisor's gonna be back any minute now.

475
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:31,670
<19-7,RAUCH>这事能不能等一下
<19-7,RAUCH>Can't this wait?

476
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:37,290
<20-1,RAUCH>看上去所有东西都在
<20-1,RAUCH>Well, looks like everything's in its place.

477
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,140
<20-2,ALEXIS>你把胰岛素放在哪
<20-2,ALEXIS>Where do you keep the insulin?

478
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:41,990
<20-2,ALEXIS>该死
<20-2,ALEXIS>Shoot.

479
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:44,990
<20-3,RAUCH>我们丢了2瓶
<20-3,RAUCH>We're missing two vials.

480
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,920
<20-4,ALEXIS>那个摄像头有显示屏吗
<20-4,ALEXIS>Do you have a monitor for the camera?

481
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:48,970
<20-5,RAUCH>有
<20-5,RAUCH>Yeah.

482
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,070
<20-6,ALEXIS>回放到那通电话的时候
<20-6,ALEXIS>Play back the time of the call.

483
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:00,610
<21-1,RAUCH>怎么回事
<21-1,RAUCH>What the hell?

484
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,630
<21-2,ALEXIS>暂停一下
<21-2,ALEXIS>Freeze it.

485
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,540
<21-3,RAUCH>斯特赖克小姐  我会有麻烦吗
<21-3,RAUCH>Ms. Stryker, am I gonna get in trouble for this?

486
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:33,930
<21-4,ALEXIS>这是我们之间的小秘密
<21-4,ALEXIS>We'll keep it our little secret.

487
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:39,980
<22-1,CASTLE>这些人到底是谁
<22-1,CASTLE>Who the hell are these people?

488
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:43,330
<22-2,HAYLEY>总之找找可以用来追踪这些人的东西
<22-2,HAYLEY>Just look for anything that we can use to track these guys.

489
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,810
<22-3,CASTLE>这些和剧院里那些枪手用的
<22-3,CASTLE>These are the same .40-calibers

490
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:51,680
<22-3,CASTLE>40口径枪一模一样
<22-3,CASTLE>the shooters in the theater had.

491
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:58,930
<22-4,HAYLEY>你在给谁发信息  警察吗
<22-4,HAYLEY>Who did you just text? The cops?

492
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:01,430
<22-4,HAYLEY>我们有言在先  你食言了
<22-4,HAYLEY>We had a deal. You shook on it.

493
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:02,870
<22-5,CASTLE>如果你想要我遵守诺言
<22-5,CASTLE>If you wanted a binding agreement,

494
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:03,990
<22-5,CASTLE>我们应该打勾勾
<22-5,CASTLE>we should have pinky-sweared.

495
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,360
<22-6,HAYLEY>你多大了  四岁吗
<22-6,HAYLEY>What are you, 4?

496
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,350
<22-7,CASTLE>海莉  发生了什么
<22-7,CASTLE>Hayley, what happened?

497
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:13,450
<22-8,HAYLEY>我被揍惨了
<22-8,HAYLEY>Ooh. I got my ass kicked.

498
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,600
<22-11,CASTLE>什么事
<22-11,CASTLE>Hey. What's up?

499
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,870
<22-12,ALEXIS>爸爸  我追踪到了一辆贝克特
<22-12,ALEXIS>Dad, I was able to track Beckett

500
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:20,730
<22-12,ALEXIS>和那个神秘男子上过的出租车
<22-12,ALEXIS>and that mystery man to a taxi.

501
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:22,650
<22-13,CASTLE>你真是太棒了  那好
<22-13,CASTLE>You are the best. Okay. Um...

502
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,550
<22-13,CASTLE>现在我们只需要给出租车公司打电话
<22-13,CASTLE>Now all we have to do is call the cab company,

503
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,580
<22-13,CASTLE>问问他们去了哪里
<22-13,CASTLE>figure out where they went.

504
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:28,780
<22-14,ALEXIS>已经问了  他们去了州北的一座监狱
<22-14,ALEXIS>Already did. They went to a prison upstate.

505
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:30,920
<22-15,CASTLE>真的  她还在那吗
<22-15,CASTLE>Really? Is she still there?

506
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:34,610
<22-16,ALEXIS>不  但她探视了一名犯人  威廉·布莱肯
<22-16,ALEXIS>No, but she visited an inmat -- William Bracken.

507
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:36,940
<22-16,ALEXIS>布莱肯
<22-16,ALEXIS>Bracken?

508
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,470
<22-17,HAYLEY>你妻子为什么去探视一个犯罪的前参议员
<22-17,HAYLEY>Okay, why is your wife visiting a disgraced former senator?

509
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:42,370
<22-18,CASTLE>他们有过节
<22-18,CASTLE>They have history.

510
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:43,910
<22-19,HAYLEY>什么样的过节
<22-19,HAYLEY>What kind of history?

511
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:45,920
<22-20,CASTLE>他杀了贝克特的母亲
<22-20,CASTLE>He had Beckett's mother killed.

512
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:48,260
<22-21,ALEXIS>这是她成为警察的原因
<22-21,ALEXIS>It's why she became a cop.

513
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,080
<22-21,ALEXIS>她为了逮捕他付出了一切
<22-21,ALEXIS>She dedicated her life to hunting him.

514
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,020
<22-22,HAYLEY>那么他们为什么又见面
<22-22,HAYLEY>Okay, so, what's with the reunion?

515
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:54,630
<22-22,HAYLEY>而且为什么偏偏选今天
<22-22,HAYLEY>And why today of all days?

516
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,460
<22-23,CASTLE>因为这都是布莱肯搞的鬼
<22-23,CASTLE>Because Bracken's behind this.

517
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:59,110
<22-24,HAYLEY>我知道他曾经权倾一时
<22-24,HAYLEY>I know he was a powerful man,

518
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:00,770
<22-24,HAYLEY>但一旦被判终身监禁
<22-24,HAYLEY>but that sort of influence dries up

519
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:02,200
<22-24,HAYLEY>他的影响力很快就枯竭了
<22-24,HAYLEY>when you're serving life in prison.

520
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,790
<22-25,CASTLE>你不知道和布莱肯打交道的都是些什么人
<22-25,CASTLE>You don't know the kind of people Bracken was aligned with --

521
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:07,540
<22-25,CASTLE>雇佣兵  毒贩子  人渣里的人渣
<22-25,CASTLE>mercenaries, dealers, the worst of the worst.

522
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:08,970
<22-25,CASTLE>他曾让很多人发大财
<22-25,CASTLE>He made a lot of people rich.

523
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,520
<22-25,CASTLE>其中大部分也许还欠他人情
<22-25,CASTLE>A lot of whom may still owe him favors.

524
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:16,750
<22-26,HAYLEY>你是说是威廉·布莱肯派人袭击了你的妻子
<22-26,HAYLEY>You're saying that William Bracken ordered a hit on your wife?

525
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:20,370
<22-27,CASTLE>贝克特毁掉了他所谓的伟业  他的人生
<22-27,CASTLE>Beckett ruined his so-called legacy, his life.

526
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,850
<22-27,CASTLE>他要让她付出代价
<22-27,CASTLE>He's out for payback.

529
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:37,100
<22-28,HAYLEY>你真的认为布莱肯是主谋
<22-28,HAYLEY>You really think Bracken's behind this?

530
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,890
<22-29,CASTLE>这样讲得通  布莱肯为人狂妄
<22-29,CASTLE>The story tracks. Bracken is a megalomaniac

531
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:41,480
<22-29,CASTLE>很可能怨恨贝克特毁掉他的人生
<22-29,CASTLE>who could blame Beckett for ruining his life

532
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,320
<22-29,CASTLE>虽然就凭他杀了她母亲  完全是罪有应得
<22-29,CASTLE>even though it was justice for what he did to her mother.

533
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:47,120
<22-30,CASTLE>等我出来你还会在这里吗
<22-30,CASTLE>You gonna be here when I come out?

534
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,250
<22-32,CASTLE>-不  -因为我给莱恩和埃斯波西托发短信
<22-32,CASTLE>- No. - Because I texted Ryan and Esposito?

535
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:51,320
<22-33,HAYLEY>我说了不带警察
<22-33,HAYLEY>I said no cops.

536
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:54,700
<22-34,CASTLE>你宁愿那个放满枪支的储藏柜不被发现
<22-34,CASTLE>You'd rather there be a storage locker full of guns out there?

537
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,920
<22-35,HAYLEY>这不是我的问题
<22-35,HAYLEY>It's not my problem.

538
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:58,700
<22-37,HAYLEY>听着里克  如果你想成为真正的私家侦探
<22-37,HAYLEY>Look, Rick, if you want to be a real P.I.

539
00:24:58,710 --> 00:24:59,830
<22-37,HAYLEY>而不是只装装样子
<22-37,HAYLEY>and not just play dress-up,

540
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:01,860
<22-37,HAYLEY>你必须改变一下你的做事方法
<22-37,HAYLEY>you're gonna have to make some changes in how you operate.

541
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,260
<22-38,CASTLE>比如对我的朋友们说谎
<22-38,CASTLE>Changes like lying to my friends?

542
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,250
<22-39,HAYLEY>没错  有时候就是如此
<22-39,HAYLEY>Yeah, sometimes.

543
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:06,720
<22-39,HAYLEY>有时候你甚至需要坑他们
<22-39,HAYLEY>And sometimes you're even gonna have to screw them over.

544
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,110
<22-40,CASTLE>不用了  谢谢
<22-40,CASTLE>Yeah. No, thanks.

545
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:11,270
<22-41,HAYLEY>这行里老好人可只不是垫底而已  卡塞尔
<22-41,HAYLEY>Look, nice guys don't just finish last in this business, Castle.

546
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:12,310
<22-41,HAYLEY>他们丧命的
<22-41,HAYLEY>They end up dead.

547
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,430
<22-42,CASTLE>回头见
<22-42,CASTLE>I'll see you around.

548
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,150
<22-43,HAYLEY>你真的很爱她  是吗
<22-43,HAYLEY>You really love her, don't you?

549
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:19,340
<22-44,CASTLE>无法自拔
<22-44,CASTLE>Like a house on fire.

550
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,400
<22-45,HAYLEY>一定感觉不错
<22-45,HAYLEY>Must be nice.

551
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,840
<22-46,HAYLEY>快速拨号5
<22-46,HAYLEY>Speed dial 5.

552
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,500
<22-47,WOMAN>-说  -是我
<22-47,WOMAN>- Go. - It's me.

553
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:31,280
<22-49,WOMAN>你需要什么
<22-49,WOMAN>What do you need?

554
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,630
<22-50,HAYLEY>告诉实验室我要过去  有东西需要他们化验
<22-50,HAYLEY>Tell the lab I'm coming in with something for them to test.

555
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,270
<22-50,HAYLEY>我要立刻知道结果
<22-50,HAYLEY>Gonna need it I.D.'d right away.

556
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,830
<23-1,WILLIAM BRACKEN>不  不
<23-1,WILLIAM BRACKEN>No. No, no, no, no.

557
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:54,900
<23-1,WILLIAM BRACKEN>别想了  我和你无话可说
<23-1,WILLIAM BRACKEN>Forget it. I got nothing to say to you.

558
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:55,870
<23-1,WILLIAM BRACKEN>真不幸
<23-1,WILLIAM BRACKEN>Oh, tough.

559
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:58,450
<23-2,CASTLE>我知道贝克特来过这  而且我知道原因
<23-2,CASTLE>I know Beckett was here, and I know why.

560
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:00,820
<23-2,CASTLE>所以你最好让你的走狗立刻停手
<23-2,CASTLE>So you're gonna call off your dogs right now.

561
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:03,100
<23-3,BRACKEN>否则呢  你就要写点什么来损我吗
<23-3,BRACKEN>Or what? Are you gonna write something mean about me?

562
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,030
<23-4,CASTLE>否则我就以你的名义来创建一个奖学金
<23-4,CASTLE>Or I'm gonna start a scholarship in your name

563
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:07,240
<23-4,CASTLE>奖励给第一个在监狱洗衣房
<23-4,CASTLE>and offer it to the children of the first inmate

564
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,990
<23-4,CASTLE>打断你小腿的犯人的孩子
<23-4,CASTLE>who shanks you in the prison laundry.

565
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,170
<23-5,BRACKEN>那你是白花钱
<23-5,BRACKEN>You'll be wasting your money.

566
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:12,090
<23-6,CASTLE>原谅我不打算听你的
<23-6,CASTLE>Oh, forgive me if I don't take your word for it.

567
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:17,690
<23-7,CASTLE>有什么好笑的
<23-7,CASTLE>What's so funny?

568
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:19,730
<23-7,CASTLE>你
<23-7,CASTLE>You.

569
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:25,110
<23-8,BRACKEN>你为了你的妻子着急上火地来到这
<23-8,BRACKEN>You come in here all on fire about your wife.

570
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,950
<23-8,BRACKEN>可你甚至不知道她到底是谁
<23-8,BRACKEN>You don't even know who she is.

571
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:31,550
<23-8,BRACKEN>凯特·贝克特执着于解决
<23-8,BRACKEN>16 years, Kate Beckett's been obsessed

572
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:33,230
<23-8,BRACKEN>她母亲的谋杀案整整16年
<23-8,BRACKEN>with solving her mother's murder.

573
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:36,440
<23-8,BRACKEN>你真的觉得她可以就此放下这种执念
<23-8,BRACKEN>You really think she can turn off that kind of obsession?

574
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,770
<23-9,CASTLE>你是说这都是她的错
<23-9,CASTLE>Are you saying this is her fault?

575
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:44,050
<23-10,BRACKEN>我是说  只做卡塞尔夫人肯定满足不了她
<23-10,BRACKEN>I'm saying she's never gonna be happy just being Mrs. Castle.

576
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:46,470
<23-10,BRACKEN>她需要一个战场
<23-10,BRACKEN>She needs to tilt at windmills.

577
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:50,290
<23-10,BRACKEN>这念头深入骨髓  就像飞蛾都要扑火
<23-10,BRACKEN>It's in her DNA, like a moth to the flame.

578
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,430
<23-10,BRACKEN>我们都知道飞蛾的结局是什么
<23-10,BRACKEN>And we all know what happens to the moth in the end.

579
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:03,400
<23-11,BRACKEN>我要出去
<23-11,BRACKEN>Let me out of here.

580
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:11,950
<24-1,RYAN>库房是有人用偷来的身份证租的
<24-1,RYAN>Hey. Storage unit was rented with a stolen I.D.

581
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:13,660
<24-1,RYAN>我们知道谁在追踪这个
<24-1,RYAN>Who do we know has been chasing those?

582
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:14,820
<24-2,ESPOSITO>海莉·希普顿
<24-2,ESPOSITO>Hayley Shipton.

583
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,900
<24-3,RYAN>她应该有那批被盗身份的清单
<24-3,RYAN>She must have a list of all stolen I.D.s in that bundle.

584
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:18,530
<24-3,RYAN>用它追踪那些杀手到这里
<24-3,RYAN>Used it to track our shooters here.

585
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:20,870
<24-4,ESPOSITO>还说服卡塞尔瞒着我们跟他跑了
<24-4,ESPOSITO>And to convince castle to run with her instead of us.

586
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:22,880
<24-5,RYAN>-他在想什么  -他没想
<24-5,RYAN>- What the hell's he thinking? - He's not.

587
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,810
<24-6,ESPOSITO>他只是在行动
<24-6,ESPOSITO>He's reacting,

588
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:25,580
<24-6,ESPOSITO>用尽一切方法来寻找贝克特
<24-6,ESPOSITO>trying whatever he can to find Beckett.

589
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:26,980
<24-7,RYAN>这会害死他的
<24-7,RYAN>It's gonna get him killed.

590
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:29,670
<24-8,RYAN>看看这些  都是最新式的武器
<24-8,RYAN>Look at all this stuff. It's all next-gen weaponry.

591
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:32,070
<24-8,RYAN>活塞驱动  还装了热成像视镜
<24-8,RYAN>Piston-driven, tricked out with thermal scopes,

592
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:32,740
<24-8,RYAN>还有消音器
<24-8,RYAN>sound suppressors.

593
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,220
<24-9,ESPOSITO>可能是职业突击队的设备
<24-9,ESPOSITO>Probably some kind of professional hit squad or something.

594
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,390
<24-10,RYAN>但是谁买的呢
<24-10,RYAN>Yeah, but who's paying them?

595
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,570
<24-10,RYAN>以及这些怎么会和贝克特有关
<24-10,RYAN>And how do they connect to Beckett?

596
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:43,470
<24-12,RYAN>干洗店店员描述的人的画像出来了
<24-12,RYAN>I.D. Sketch from the dry-cleaner's came back.

597
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:44,740
<24-12,RYAN>这是和贝克特一起的人
<24-12,RYAN>The guy running with Beckett.

598
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,650
<24-13,ESPOSITO>我们先去系统里加急搜索这个人
<24-13,ESPOSITO>Let's priority-one this through the system

599
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,920
<24-13,ESPOSITO>希望这个人的身份能让我们有些头绪
<24-13,ESPOSITO>and hope that an I.D. On this guy gets us some clarity.

600
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,340
<25-1,AJ>继续走  往蓝色货车那边去
<25-1,AJ>Keep walking. Head for the blue van.

601
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,360
<25-2,CASTLE>我正等着你呢
<25-2,CASTLE>Oh, just the person I was looking for.

602
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:01,320
<25-3,AJ>大多数人被枪抵着的时候
<25-3,AJ>You know, most people react differently

603
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,390
<25-3,AJ>可不是这种反应
<25-3,AJ>to a gun in their side.

604
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:04,520
<25-4,CASTLE>没错  可能是因为这种事我经历得比较多
<25-4,CASTLE>Yeah, well, this sort of thing happens to me a lot.

605
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:07,470
<25-4,CASTLE>我刚才还去拜访了你老板
<25-4,CASTLE>So, I was just in there visiting with your boss.

606
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:08,730
<25-4,CASTLE>我不知道他付你多少钱
<25-4,CASTLE>I don't know how much he's paying you,

607
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:10,000
<25-4,CASTLE>但肯定不值得你为此丢命
<25-4,CASTLE>but it can't be worth your life.

608
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:13,160
<25-5,AJ>你是真的什么都不知道  是吧
<25-5,AJ>You really have no idea what's going on, do you?

609
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:14,440
<25-6,CASTLE>告诉我呀
<25-6,CASTLE>So enlighten me.

610
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:16,460
<25-7,AJ>这不是我的职责
<25-7,AJ>Not my job.

611
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:17,940
<25-7,AJ>开门
<25-7,AJ>Open it.

612
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:31,810
<25-8,AJ>好好睡一觉吧
<25-8,AJ>Sleep well.

613
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,850
<26-1,ALEXIS>我爸失踪了  我们得找到他
<26-1,ALEXIS>Dad's missing! We have to find him!

614
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,070
<26-2,ESPOSITO>慢点说
<26-2,ESPOSITO>Slow down.

615
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:36,950
<26-2,ESPOSITO>你在  你在说什么
<26-2,ESPOSITO>What are you -- what are you talking about?

616
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:38,220
<26-3,ALEXIS>我一直在偷偷追踪他的手机信号
<26-3,ALEXIS>I've been tracking his cellphone on the sly.

617
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,690
<26-3,ALEXIS>这样万一他再突然消失  我会知道的
<26-3,ALEXIS>That way, if he ever disappeared again, I'd know.

618
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:41,390
<26-3,ALEXIS>一小时前  他忽然关机了
<26-3,ALEXIS>And an hour ago, his phone suddenly went dead.

619
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,570
<26-4,RYAN>也许是没电了呢
<26-4,RYAN>Okay, maybe the battery just died.

620
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:43,810
<26-5,ALEXIS>不会  他不会不充电就去那
<26-5,ALEXIS>No. Not with where he went.

621
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:44,890
<26-6,RYAN>他去哪儿了
<26-6,RYAN>And where's that?

622
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:47,180
<26-7,ALEXIS>冬煞监狱  我之前追踪贝克特到那
<26-7,ALEXIS>Winterkill correctional. I tracked Beckett there earlier.

623
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:49,190
<26-8,ESPOSITO>冬煞  布莱肯在那个监狱
<26-8,ESPOSITO>Winterkill. That's where bracken is.

624
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:51,600
<26-9,ALEXIS>这件事似乎与他有关  所以我爸去找他了
<26-9,ALEXIS>He's connected to this somehow. That's why dad went to see him.

625
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,140
<26-11,ESPOSITO>还不告诉我们  海莉肯定也去了
<26-11,ESPOSITO>Without telling us. But I bet Hayley went along, huh?

626
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:55,190
<26-12,ALEXIS>是的  但是我给她打电话的时候
<26-12,ALEXIS>Yeah, but when I called her,

627
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:56,430
<26-12,ALEXIS>她说她在监狱跟他分开了
<26-12,ALEXIS>she said she left him at the prison.

628
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:57,280
<26-12,ALEXIS>之后就没有联系过
<26-12,ALEXIS>Hasn't heard from him since.

629
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,620
<26-13,RYAN>好吧  我去联系监狱
<26-13,RYAN>All right, I'll reach out to the prison,

630
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:59,900
<26-13,RYAN>找找他们的外围监控录像
<26-13,RYAN>get their external surveillance feed.

631
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:01,810
<26-15,ALEXIS>-好吧  -你要去哪
<26-15,ALEXIS>- All right. - Where are you going?

632
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:02,620
<26-16,ESPOSITO>去找海莉
<26-16,ESPOSITO>To get Hayley.

633
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:08,680
<27-1,AJ>你别装了  我给你那针药效已经过了
<27-1,AJ>You can quit faking. The dose I gave you wore off by now.

634
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,610
<27-2,CASTLE>我总得试试看吧
<27-2,CASTLE>Well, you can't blame a guy for trying.

635
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:12,450
<27-3,AJ>比起《斯道姆来临》里德里克·斯道姆的把戏
<27-3,AJ>You might want to try something a little more original

636
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:14,780
<27-3,AJ>你更应该换换新花样了
<27-3,AJ>than the trick derrick storm pulled in "Storm Fall."

637
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:16,400
<27-4,CASTLE>你读过我的书
<27-4,CASTLE>You read my books?

638
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:17,990
<27-5,AJ>我们这行空闲时间多
<27-5,AJ>Lot of downtime in my line of work.

639
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,440
<27-5,AJ>你早期的书更好
<27-5,AJ>Your earlier stuff was better.

640
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,070
<27-5,AJ>遇到那女人之后就越写越差了
<27-5,AJ>You got soft once you met the skirt.

641
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,150
<27-6,CASTLE>人人都是评论家
<27-6,CASTLE>Everyone's a critic.

642
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,020
<27-7,AJ>坐吧
<27-7,AJ>Sit.

643
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,950
<27-8,CASTLE>我看你肯定不是新手了
<27-8,CASTLE>Can't help but think you've done this before.

644
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:43,990
<27-9,CASTLE>我是理查德·卡塞尔
<27-9,CASTLE>Hey. Richard castle.

645
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,710
<27-9,CASTLE>我想跟你握手来着  但是
<27-9,CASTLE>I'd shake hands, but...

646
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:48,190
<27-10,BROOKS>-你觉得挺有趣的是不是  -不不不
<27-10,BROOKS>- You think this is funny? - No. No, no.

647
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:50,580
<27-11,CASTLE>我只是觉得你太严肃了
<27-11,CASTLE>I just felt like you'd be serious enough

648
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,670
<27-11,CASTLE>想活跃下气氛
<27-11,CASTLE>for the both of us.

649
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,270
<27-12,BROOKS>那你看我这样严不严肃
<27-12,BROOKS>Well, how's this for serious?

650
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:55,210
<27-12,BROOKS>要不你告诉我你老婆在哪
<27-12,BROOKS>You either tell me where your wife is...

651
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:56,380
<27-12,BROOKS>要不我杀了你
<27-12,BROOKS>or I'm gonna kill you.

652
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,260
<28-1,BROOKS>这问题很简单
<28-1,BROOKS>This is a simple question.

653
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:05,990
<28-1,BROOKS>凯特·贝克特在哪
<28-1,BROOKS>Where's Kate Beckett?

654
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:07,520
<28-1,BROOKS>我不知道
<28-1,BROOKS>I don't know.

655
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:10,510
<28-2,CASTLE>而且就算我知道  我也不会告诉你的
<28-2,CASTLE>And even if I did know, I wouldn't tell you.

656
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,030
<28-3,BROOKS>真是奇了怪了  他们都这么说
<28-3,BROOKS>You know, it's amazing. They all say that.

657
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:15,300
<28-4,AJ>但是到最后他们都招了
<28-4,AJ>And yet they all end up talking in the end.

658
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:16,850
<28-5,CASTLE>既然我们都在问问题
<28-5,CASTLE>You know, since we're asking questions,

659
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:19,020
<28-5,CASTLE>或许你们能帮我补全一些信息
<28-5,CASTLE>maybe you guys could fill in a few blanks for me.

660
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:22,910
<28-5,CASTLE>比如  既然你们的老板不是布莱肯  谁是
<28-5,CASTLE>For example, if bracken isn't your boss, then who is?

661
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,380
<28-6,AJ>我觉得他还是没把这回事当真
<28-6,AJ>You know what, I don't think he's taking this seriously.

662
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:28,100
<28-6,AJ>也许吃点苦头可以帮他集中注意力
<28-6,AJ>Maybe a little pain will help him focus.

663
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,290
<28-7,CASTLE>不用了  但你知道吗
<28-7,CASTLE>Pass. But you know what?

664
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:31,770
<28-7,CASTLE>我现在非常想喝一杯卡布奇诺
<28-7,CASTLE>I would kill for a nice cappuccino right now,

665
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:32,750
<28-7,CASTLE>要多加奶泡
<28-7,CASTLE>Extra froth.

666
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:35,200
<28-8,BROOKS>你指望我们相信你老婆
<28-8,BROOKS>You expect us to believe that your wife

667
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,620
<28-8,BROOKS>把你蒙在鼓里
<28-8,BROOKS>Is keeping you in the dark?

668
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,760
<28-9,AJ>这么问不管用  你想要我们怎么审问他
<28-9,AJ>Look, this isn't working. How do you want to do this?

669
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,380
<28-9,AJ>是挨个切掉他的手指直到他说实话
<28-9,AJ>Start by cutting off his fingers until he talks

670
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,800
<28-9,AJ>还是让他直接变成婚礼上的佳肴呢
<28-9,AJ>or jump straight for the wedding vegetables?

671
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,490
<28-10,BROOKS>其实  我在想一种
<28-10,BROOKS>You know, actually, I was thinking something

672
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:49,070
<28-10,BROOKS>也许更加折磨人心的方法
<28-10,BROOKS>maybe a little more, uh, psychological.

673
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:02,750
<28-11,CASTLE>说实话  那东西看起来并不怎么可怕
<28-11,CASTLE>I'm gonna be honest with you. That doesn't look that scary.

674
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:04,850
<28-12,BROOKS>为什么不再看一下呢
<28-12,BROOKS>Well, why don't you look again?

675
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:14,310
<28-13,AJ>好吧  我要吐了
<28-13,AJ>Okay, I might puke.

676
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,300
<28-14,BROOKS>她在哪  卡塞尔
<28-14,BROOKS>Where is she, Castle?

677
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,540
<28-15,CASTLE>我不知道
<28-15,CASTLE>I don't know.

678
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:30,930
<28-16,BROOKS>她在哪
<28-16,BROOKS>Where is she?

679
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:33,140
<28-16,BROOKS>我不知道
<28-16,BROOKS>I don't know!

680
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:37,920
<28-16,BROOKS>她在哪
<28-16,BROOKS>Where is she?

681
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:39,060
<28-16,BROOKS>我什么也不知道
<28-16,BROOKS>I don't know anything.

682
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:41,520
<29-1,HAYLEY>最后一次看见卡塞尔是在监狱外面
<29-1,HAYLEY>The last time I saw Castle was outside the prison.

683
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,870
<29-2,ESPOSITO>我还以为当过警察就能明白
<29-2,ESPOSITO>You'd think an ex-cop would understand

684
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:43,960
<29-2,ESPOSITO>妨碍司法公正是怎么回事
<29-2,ESPOSITO>obstruction of justice.

685
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,800
<29-3,RYAN>是啊  尤其是她如果为此被捕的话
<29-3,RYAN>Yeah, especially since arresting her for it

686
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,460
<29-3,RYAN>她的侦探执照也会被吊销
<29-3,RYAN>will torpedo her investigator's license.

687
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:48,960
<29-4,HAYLEY>你们别想吓唬我  两位
<29-4,HAYLEY>You're not scaring me, guys.

688
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,050
<29-4,HAYLEY>你以为我们在闹着玩吗
<29-4,HAYLEY>You think we're playing?

689
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,120
<29-5,ESPOSITO>卡塞尔是我们的兄弟  所以你最好
<29-5,ESPOSITO>Castle's one of us, which means you better

690
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,380
<29-5,ESPOSITO>乖乖坦白  否则全城的警察
<29-5,ESPOSITO>come clean right now, or every cop in this city

691
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:56,080
<29-5,ESPOSITO>都会想办法找你的麻烦
<29-5,ESPOSITO>is gonna make it their mission to jam you up.

692
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,730
<29-6,HAYLEY>我能理解你们的愤怒
<29-6,HAYLEY>I understand the passion.

693
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:59,940
<29-6,HAYLEY>但我必须维护我的职业信誉
<29-6,HAYLEY>But I have a reputation to uphold.

694
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,290
<29-6,HAYLEY>如果我的客户认为
<29-6,HAYLEY>My clients think that I roll over

695
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:02,450
<29-6,HAYLEY>警察一吓唬我  我就投降
<29-6,HAYLEY>every time a cop says "Boo,"

696
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:04,070
<29-6,HAYLEY>那我就别在这行混了
<29-6,HAYLEY>I'm looking for a new line of work.

697
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:05,370
<29-6,HAYLEY>该死  我爸爸现在生死未卜
<29-6,HAYLEY>Damn it, my dad's in trouble!

698
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:07,880
<29-7,ALEXIS>如果你知道他在哪里  你必须告诉我们
<29-7,ALEXIS>If you know anything about where he is, you have to tell us.

699
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:11,060
<29-8,HAYLEY>阿丽克西斯  没那么简单的
<29-8,HAYLEY>Alexis, it's not that simple.

700
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:12,460
<29-9,ALEXIS>不  就是这么简单
<29-9,ALEXIS>Yes, it is.

701
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:15,290
<29-9,ALEXIS>求你了
<29-9,ALEXIS>Please.

702
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:22,220
<29-10,HAYLEY>好吧  我的确隐瞒了一些事
<29-10,HAYLEY>Okay, there is something I kept to myself,

703
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,400
<29-10,HAYLEY>不过对你们没什么帮助的
<29-10,HAYLEY>but it's not gonna help you.

704
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,340
<29-10,HAYLEY>那是条死路
<29-10,HAYLEY>It's a dead end.

705
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,190
<29-11,RYAN>快说
<29-11,RYAN>Spill.

706
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,430
<29-12,HAYLEY>我在储存室那碰到个女人
<29-12,HAYLEY>There was a woman at the storage locker.

707
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:29,760
<29-12,HAYLEY>我们过了几招
<29-12,HAYLEY>We mixed it up a little.

708
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,350
<29-12,HAYLEY>她踢我时  靴子上的东西蹭到了我衣服上
<29-12,HAYLEY>When she kicked me, something transferred from her boot.

709
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,980
<29-12,HAYLEY>我找地方化验了  是木馏油
<29-12,HAYLEY>I had a lab test it. It's creosote.

710
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,430
<29-12,HAYLEY>它是煤焦油的一种
<29-12,HAYLEY>It's a form of coal tar

711
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:38,570
<29-12,HAYLEY>主要用于处理铁路上的枕木
<29-12,HAYLEY>primarily used to treat railway ties.

712
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:41,560
<29-12,HAYLEY>有成千上万这种枕木被用在地铁轨道上
<29-12,HAYLEY>There are tens of thousands of those ties used in the subway.

713
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,280
<29-13,ESPOSITO>你有实验室报告的复本吗
<29-13,ESPOSITO>You get a copy of the lab report?

714
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,120
<29-14,HAYLEY>有
<29-14,HAYLEY>Yeah.

715
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:49,800
<29-15,RYAN>不  枕木不是地铁里的
<29-15,RYAN>No, tie's not from the subway.

716
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:50,710
<29-17,ALEXIS>什么  你怎么知道
<29-17,ALEXIS>What? How do you know?

717
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:52,810
<29-18,RYAN>没有任何钢铁粉尘或其它污染物的迹象
<29-18,RYAN>No traces of any steel dust or any other pollutants.

718
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:54,570
<29-18,RYAN>我推测那铁路上的枕木是新的
<29-18,RYAN>My guess is that the railroad tie's new.

719
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:56,720
<29-19,ESPOSITO>我打电话给运输署  问这些东西储存在哪
<29-19,ESPOSITO>I'll call MTA. See where they store those things.

720
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:01,500
<29-20,ALEXIS>谢谢你
<29-20,ALEXIS>Thank you.

721
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,180
<30-1,BROOKS>她在哪
<30-1,BROOKS>Where is she?

722
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,780
<30-2,BROOKS>你妻子在哪  卡塞尔
<30-2,BROOKS>Where's your wife, Castle?

723
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:10,430
<30-3,CASTLE>我不知道  我发誓
<30-3,CASTLE>I don't know! I swear!

724
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,700
<30-4,AJ>你答错了
<30-4,AJ>That is the wrong answer.

725
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,570
<30-5,BROOKS>告诉我你妻子在哪
<30-5,BROOKS>Tell me where your wife is.

<30-6,BROOKS>Tell me where she is.

727
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:33,950
<28-16,BROOKS>她在哪
<28-16,BROOKS>Where is she?

728
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,600
<30-7,BROOKS>我不知道
<30-7,BROOKS>I don't know!

729
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,810
<30-8,CASTLE>卡塞尔  任何女人都不值得你牺牲自己
<30-8,CASTLE>Come on, Castle. No woman is worth dying for.

730
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:40,000
<30-9,BROOKS>快说  她在哪
<30-9,BROOKS>Come on. Where is she?!

731
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:55,680
<30-10,BROOKS>我相信你说得是实话  真的
<30-10,BROOKS>I believe that you're telling the truth. I do.

732
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,890
<30-10,BROOKS>我相信你对我们说得都是实话
<30-10,BROOKS>I believe that you're telling me the truth.

733
00:33:56,890 --> 00:33:59,290
<30-10,BROOKS>但很不幸  那意味着你没有活着的价值了
<30-10,BROOKS>But unfortunately, that means it's time for you to die.

734
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,240
<30-10,BROOKS>真抱歉
<30-10,BROOKS>Sorry about that.

735
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:53,930
<31-2,AJ>受死吧
<31-2,AJ>Lights out.

736
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:22,500
<31-3,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你没事吧
<31-3,BECKETT>Castle. Are you okay?

737
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:25,080
<31-4,CASTLE>你去哪了  为什么连电话也不打
<31-4,CASTLE>Where have you been? Why haven't you called?

738
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,310
<31-5,BECKETT>我没法打
<31-5,BECKETT>I couldn't.

739
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,770
<31-6,CASTLE>凯特  出什么事了
<31-6,CASTLE>Kate, what's going on?

740
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,440
<31-7,BECKETT>我...

741
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:35,930
<31-7,BECKETT>我得走了

742
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:38,010
<31-8,CASTLE>不  别走  凯特  你为什么瞒着我
<31-8,CASTLE>No, no! No, Kate -- Kate, why are you shutting me out?

743
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,310
<31-9,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我爱你
<31-9,BECKETT>Castle, I love you.

746
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,570
<31-10,CASTLE>凯特
<31-10,CASTLE>Kate.

747
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:57,100
<31-12,ESPOSITO>卡塞尔  老兄  你没事吧
<31-12,ESPOSITO>Castle! Hey, man, you okay?

748
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:59,400
<31-13,CASTLE>贝克特  她刚才在这  她刚才在这里
<31-13,CASTLE>Beckett -- she was here. She was here!

749
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,380
<31-14,ESPOSITO>什么  在哪
<31-14,ESPOSITO>What? Where?

750
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:04,500
<31-15,ALEXIS>爸爸
<31-15,ALEXIS>Dad!

751
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:09,500
<31-16,CASTLE>我没事  我没事
<31-16,CASTLE>I'm okay. I'm okay.

752
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,710
<31-16,CASTLE>没事了
<31-16,CASTLE>It's okay.

753
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:13,330
<31-17,RYAN>没找到凯萨琳·贝克特  长官
<31-17,RYAN>No sign of Katherine Beckett, sir.

754
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:20,150
<31-17,RYAN>特警队说整个大楼都搜遍了
<31-17,RYAN>E.S.U. says the building is secure.

755
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:22,340
<31-17,RYAN>没发现贝克特的踪影
<31-17,RYAN>There's no sign of Beckett.

756
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:32,900
<32-1,CASTLE>贝克特为什么不信任我
<32-1,CASTLE>Why doesn't Beckett trust me?

757
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:34,180
<32-2,ALEXIS>她信任你
<32-2,ALEXIS>She does.

758
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:36,610
<32-3,CASTLE>那她为什么把我蒙在鼓里
<32-3,CASTLE>Then why is she keeping me in the dark?

759
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:38,870
<32-3,CASTLE>-我不需要人保护  -不  你需要
<32-3,CASTLE>- I don't need protecting. - Yes, you do.

760
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:40,660
<32-4,ALEXIS>你是个作家  爸爸
<32-4,ALEXIS>You're a writer, dad.

761
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,280
<32-4,ALEXIS>你俩在一起时很厉害
<32-4,ALEXIS>And you and Beckett are magic together.

762
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,780
<32-4,ALEXIS>但你并没受过她那样的训练  没有她的本事
<32-4,ALEXIS>But you don't have her training or her skill set.

763
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,800
<32-5,ALEXIS>去年你失踪的时候
<32-5,ALEXIS>When you disappeared last year...

764
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:55,540
<32-5,ALEXIS>那两个月我都以为你死了
<32-5,ALEXIS>I thought you were dead for two months.

765
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:59,920
<32-5,ALEXIS>今天你失踪的时候我真的很害怕
<32-5,ALEXIS>And then you went missing today, and I was so scared.

766
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:01,690
<32-6,CASTLE>亲爱的
<32-6,CASTLE>Honey --

767
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:03,580
<32-7,ALEXIS>贝克特保守秘密是有原因的
<32-7,ALEXIS>Beckett has a reason for keeping quiet.

768
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,410
<32-7,ALEXIS>如果你爱她  你就要相信她
<32-7,ALEXIS>If you love her, you have to trust her.

769
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:13,040
<32-8,CASTLE>我们还在等什么  给她点苦头
<32-8,CASTLE>Finally. What are we waiting for? Let's go give her hell.

770
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,930
<32-9,RYAN>-卡塞尔别着急  -我们已经找出
<32-9,RYAN>- Castle, wait. - We got a positive I.D.

771
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:16,320
<32-10,ESPOSITO>和贝克特在一起的那人的身份
<32-10,ESPOSITO>on the guy running with Beckett.

772
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:17,410
<32-11,CASTLE>很好  是谁
<32-11,CASTLE>Great. Who is he?

773
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:18,890
<32-12,RYAN>他叫维克拉姆·辛格
<32-12,RYAN>His name is Vikram Singh.

774
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,310
<32-12,RYAN>他是个初级分析员
<32-12,RYAN>He's a low-level analyst

775
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,370
<32-12,RYAN>供职于总检察长调查办公室
<32-12,RYAN>for the attorney general's investigative office.

776
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:23,430
<32-12,RYAN>在华盛顿吗
<32-12,RYAN>In D.C.?

777
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:25,170
<32-13,ALEXIS>贝克特在那儿工作过
<32-13,ALEXIS>That's where Beckett worked.

778
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:27,070
<32-14,CASTLE>对  但那是两年前了
<32-14,CASTLE>Yeah, but that was two years ago,

779
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:28,740
<32-14,CASTLE>她从没提过一个叫维克拉姆的人
<32-14,CASTLE>and she never mentioned anyone named Vikram.

780
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:30,540
<32-15,ESPOSITO>据我们所知  他们俩没有交集
<32-15,ESPOSITO>Yeah, as far as we can tell, their paths never crossed.

781
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,070
<32-15,ESPOSITO>他几个月前才开始在那工作
<32-15,ESPOSITO>He's only been on the job a few months.

782
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,280
<32-16,CASTLE>那贝克特怎么会认识他
<32-16,CASTLE>Then how would Beckett know him?

783
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:36,170
<32-16,CASTLE>我们得联系蕾切尔·麦考德
<32-16,CASTLE>We need to call Rachel McCord.

784
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:37,140
<32-16,CASTLE>她是贝克特的搭档
<32-16,CASTLE>She was Beckett's partner.

785
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,700
<32-17,RYAN>麦考德已经死了  卡塞尔
<32-17,RYAN>McCord's dead, Castle.

786
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:41,020
<32-17,RYAN>于昨天的一次车祸中遇害
<32-17,RYAN>Killed yesterday in an automobile accident,

787
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,480
<32-17,RYAN>遇害的还有她那组的其他三名成员
<32-17,RYAN>Along with three other members of her team.

788
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,200
<32-18,CASTLE>这肯定不是巧合
<32-18,CASTLE>That can't be a coincidence.

789
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:46,990
<32-18,CASTLE>肯定不是
<32-18,CASTLE>It's not.

790
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:48,560
<32-19,ESPOSITO>她组内的最后一名成员也于昨晚
<32-19,ESPOSITO>The last member of her team was stabbed to death

791
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,930
<32-19,ESPOSITO>在一家俱乐部中被刺死
<32-19,ESPOSITO>at a club that same night.

792
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:52,820
<32-19,ESPOSITO>有人看到他和一位性感褐色头发女子调情
<32-19,ESPOSITO>Witnesses saw him flirting with a hot brunette.

793
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:55,000
<32-20,CASTLE>这都说不通
<32-20,CASTLE>This doesn't make any sense.

794
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:57,360
<32-20,CASTLE>这和布莱肯有什么关系
<32-20,CASTLE>What does any of this have to do with Bracken?

795
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,130
<32-21,RYAN>我们去问她吧
<32-21,RYAN>Well, let's go ask her.

796
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,490
<33-1,CASTLE>你嘴上说你有很多空闲时间
<33-1,CASTLE>For someone who says they've got a lot of downtime,

797
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:05,970
<33-1,CASTLE>但你其实忙得很啊
<33-1,CASTLE>you sure have been a busy girl.

798
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:09,530
<33-1,CASTLE>谋划车祸  在华盛顿行刺
<33-1,CASTLE>Staging car accidents, stabbings in D.C.,

799
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:11,780
<33-1,CASTLE>在纽约持枪绑架我
<33-1,CASTLE>kidnapping me at gunpoint in New York.

800
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:14,550
<33-1,CASTLE>告诉我  杀手会攒很多常客飞行里程吗
<33-1,CASTLE>Tell me, do assassins get frequent-flier miles?

801
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:16,270
<33-2,RYAN>对了  你不会坐商务机对吧
<33-2,RYAN>Ah, but you didn't fly commercial, did you?

802
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:18,400
<33-2,RYAN>我们在每趟华盛顿飞来的航班上核对你的照片
<33-2,RYAN>We ran your photo against every flight from D.C.

803
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:21,260
<33-2,RYAN>所以你要么是开车要么乘私人飞机
<33-2,RYAN>So you either road-tripped it or you took a private jet.

804
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,960
<33-2,RYAN>考虑到你的那个军械库
<33-2,RYAN>And given your arsenal,

805
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,020
<33-2,RYAN>你们肯定坐得起私人飞机
<33-2,RYAN>you people clearly have the resources.

806
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,190
<33-3,AJ>我不太确定你们想从我这知道些什么
<33-3,AJ>I'm not really sure what you're expecting here.

807
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:31,990
<33-3,AJ>泪流满面地坦白吗  想都别想
<33-3,AJ>A tearful confession? Not gonna happen.

808
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,860
<33-4,RYAN>我们希望你够聪明  能想明白
<33-4,RYAN>Well, we are expecting that you're smart enough to know

809
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,640
<33-4,RYAN>现在是想办法减轻罪责的时候
<33-4,RYAN>that it's C.Y.A. Time.

810
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:40,180
<33-5,AJ>听着  除非你有一口袋的蜘蛛
<33-5,AJ>Look, unless you've got a bag of spiders,

811
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:42,670
<33-5,AJ>我没什么好说的
<33-5,AJ>we're done here.

812
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:46,940
<33-6,CASTLE>你跟我说我什么都不知道
<33-6,CASTLE>You know, you told me I had no idea what was going on,

813
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:48,100
<33-6,CASTLE>你说得对
<33-6,CASTLE>And you were right.

814
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:49,940
<33-6,CASTLE>但现在我有点头绪了
<33-6,CASTLE>But now I've got the edge of it,

815
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,420
<33-6,CASTLE>不管有没有你的帮助
<33-6,CASTLE>and I'm gonna keep on peeling it back

816
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:54,720
<33-6,CASTLE>我都会彻查到底
<33-6,CASTLE>until I know everything, with or without your help.

817
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:58,110
<33-7,RYAN>我还是建议你配合一点  能少坐点牢
<33-7,RYAN>I'll recommend the "With." It comes with less prison time.

818
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:02,560
<33-8,AJ>跟我开口的下场相比  坐牢简直不算什么
<33-8,AJ>Prison's a picnic compared to what happens to me if I talk.

819
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,820
<33-8,AJ>你得接受这个事实
<33-8,AJ>You need to make your peace with the fact that

820
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,620
<33-8,AJ>你妻子将不久于人世了
<33-8,AJ>your wife isn't long for this world.

821
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:11,460
<33-9,CASTLE>别说这么肯定  你们团队开始有五个人
<33-9,CASTLE>Don't be so sure. Your team started out with five.

822
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:13,330
<33-9,CASTLE>有三个已经死了  而你坐在这
<33-9,CASTLE>Three of you are dead, and you're sitting right here.

823
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:15,350
<33-9,CASTLE>那还剩下一个人  你的老大
<33-9,CASTLE>That leaves one -- your boss.

824
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:18,760
<33-9,CASTLE>贝克特对付这一个人  我比较乐观
<33-9,CASTLE>And Beckett against one guy? I like those odds.

825
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:24,030
<33-10,AJ>你凭什么觉得就只有一队人马呢
<33-10,AJ>What makes you think there's only one team in play?

826
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:52,800
<33-10,AJ>很好
<33-10,AJ>All right.

827
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:01,470
<33-10,AJ>我刚和华盛顿总检察长助理通过话
<33-10,AJ>I just got off the phone with an assistant A.G. in D.C.,

828
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:02,680
<33-10,AJ>一个叫艾莉森·海德的人
<33-10,AJ>An Allison Hyde.

829
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,940
<35-1,ESPOSITO>她负责调查她的同事遇害的案子
<35-1,ESPOSITO>She's leading the investigation in the deaths of her people.

830
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:06,090
<35-1,ESPOSITO>她明天早上第一班飞机过来
<35-1,ESPOSITO>She's up on the first plane in the morning

831
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:08,210
<35-1,ESPOSITO>把那个袭击者移交联邦警察监禁
<35-1,ESPOSITO>to take our hitter into federal custody.

832
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:10,640
<35-2,CASTLE>她知不知道这个叫维克拉姆的人
<35-2,CASTLE>Does she have any idea of this Vikram guy's connection

833
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:11,480
<35-2,CASTLE>跟贝克特之间的关联
<35-2,CASTLE>to Beckett?

834
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,980
<35-3,ESPOSITO>没有  但她正在调阅他的档案
<35-3,ESPOSITO>No, but she's pulling his records.

835
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:14,630
<35-4,CASTLE>所以  现在我们没线索了
<35-4,CASTLE>So, we're nowhere.

836
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,910
<35-5,RYAN>有枪  有枪  枪
<35-5,RYAN>Gun! Gun! Gun!

837
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,310
<35-6,RYAN>所有人  趴下
<35-6,RYAN>Everybody, get down!

838
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:31,100
<35-7,ESPOSITO>小心
<35-7,ESPOSITO>Look out!

839
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:47,740
<35-8,RYAN>-我得做点什么  -别犯傻
<35-8,RYAN>- I'm gonna do something. - Don't be stupid.

840
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:48,820
<35-9,ESPOSITO>不然还有什么乐趣呢
<35-9,ESPOSITO>Where's the fun in that?

841
00:40:59,000 --> 00:40:59,990
<35-10,ESPOSITO>枪手被击倒
<35-10,ESPOSITO>Shooter's down!

842
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:01,910
<35-11,CASTLE>你没事吧
<35-11,CASTLE>Are you okay?

843
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:02,650
<35-12,UNIFORM>没事
<35-12,UNIFORM>Yeah.

844
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:05,160
<35-13,CASTLE>过来
<35-13,CASTLE>Come on.

845
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:07,210
<35-15,RYAN>警官  躺下
<35-15,RYAN>L.T. Stay down.

846
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:09,010
<35-16,OFFICER>有两位警员中枪
<35-16,OFFICER>We got two officers down.

847
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:10,970
<35-16,OFFICER>赶快
<35-16,OFFICER>Hurry up!

848
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:13,110
<35-17,CASTLE>亲爱的  别看
<35-17,CASTLE>Oh, sweetie, don't look.

849
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,040
<35-18,ALEXIS>她为什么这么做
<35-18,ALEXIS>Why did she do it?

850
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:16,140
<35-18,ALEXIS>她知道自己没法逃脱
<35-18,ALEXIS>There's no way she thought she could escape.

851
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:17,390
<35-19,CASTLE>她不是要逃脱
<35-19,CASTLE>It wasn't about escape.

852
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:20,230
<35-19,CASTLE>她被捕时就已经知道了自己的下场
<35-19,CASTLE>She knew her fate was sealed as soon as she got caught.

853
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:21,940
<35-19,CASTLE>所以她才用自己的方式自我了断
<35-19,CASTLE>That's why she went out on her own terms.

854
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,190
<35-20,ALEXIS>同时让我们毫无头绪
<35-20,ALEXIS>And made sure we stay in the dark.

855
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:29,610
<35-21,CASTLE>该死  凯特  你在哪
<35-21,CASTLE>Damn it, Kate. Where are you?
