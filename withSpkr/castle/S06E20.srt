3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:08,780
<1-1,CONSTRUCTION WORKER>停下
<1-1,CONSTRUCTION WORKER>Hold it.

4
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:20,510
<1-1,CONSTRUCTION WORKER>搞什么
<1-1,CONSTRUCTION WORKER>What the...

5
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:25,160
<1-2,CONSTRUCTION WORKER>谁去喊工头
<1-2,CONSTRUCTION WORKER>Hey! Somebody call the foreman!

6
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,700
<2-1,RICHARD CASTLE>早饭  分头击破吗
<2-1,RICHARD CASTLE>So, breakfast... divide and conquer?

7
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:28,780
<2-2,KATE BECKETT>我去煮咖啡
<2-2,KATE BECKETT>I'll make the coffee.

8
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:30,440
<2-2,KATE BECKETT>我去做鸡蛋饼
<2-2,KATE BECKETT>I'll make the omelettes.

9
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:35,020
<2-4,MARTHA RODGERS>我要让你们开心一整天
<2-4,MARTHA RODGERS>And I am going to make your day.

10
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:36,270
<2-4,MARTHA RODGERS>我带来了激动人心的好消息
<2-4,MARTHA RODGERS>I have the most exciting news.

11
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,090
<2-4,MARTHA RODGERS>我只是想等你们干完
<2-4,MARTHA RODGERS>I just wanted to wait until you were finished doing,

12
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:39,850
<2-4,MARTHA RODGERS>-你们在里面干的事  -睡觉吗
<2-4,MARTHA RODGERS>- you know, whatever you were doing in there. - Sleeping?

13
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:40,810
<2-6,BECKETT>什么消息
<2-6,BECKETT>Uh, what news?

14
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:42,290
<2-7,MARTHA>关于你们的婚礼
<2-7,MARTHA>About your wedding.

15
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:46,110
<2-8,CASTLE>你想到花卉摆放的办法了
<2-8,CASTLE>Um, you've come up with options for flower arrangements.

16
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,950
<2-9,MARTHA>我费尽心思
<2-9,MARTHA>I have searched high and low

17
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:52,930
<2-9,MARTHA>想要抓住你们的精髓
<2-9,MARTHA>trying to capture the look that is the essence of you.

18
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,070
<2-9,MARTHA>我呈现
<2-9,MARTHA>I give you...

19
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,990
<2-9,MARTHA>爱之通道
<2-9,MARTHA>The tunnel of love.

20
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,410
<2-9,MARTHA>新郎新娘走向圣坛
<2-9,MARTHA>The bride and groom walk to the altar

23
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:04,080
<2-9,MARTHA>走过用外域鲜花装饰的通道
<2-9,MARTHA>through the arched passageway festooned with exotic flowers.

25
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,670
<2-9,MARTHA>然后我又找到了这个
<2-9,MARTHA>Then I found this.

27
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,430
<2-10,CASTLE>那是一张大照片吗
<2-10,CASTLE>Is that a giant photograph?

28
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,340
<2-11,BECKETT>而且完全是花垒砌成的
<2-11,BECKETT>Made entirely of flowers?

30
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:15,620
<2-12,MARTHA>没错  不过  当然会做成是你们的样子
<2-12,MARTHA>Yes, except it would be, of course, the two of you,

31
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:19,580
<2-12,MARTHA>由技艺高超的艺术家精心打造
<2-12,MARTHA>Painstakingly crafted by skilled artisans. Just

32
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:22,330
<2-12,MARTHA>-还有呢  -妈妈
<2-12,MARTHA>- But wait, there's more. - Mother.

33
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,100
<2-13,CASTLE>我虽然很感激你如此投入
<2-13,CASTLE>As much as I appreciate your passion,

34
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,590
<2-13,CASTLE>而且显然做足了功课
<2-13,CASTLE>and obviously, diligent research,

35
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:30,680
<2-13,CASTLE>我只是觉得这有点过了
<2-13,CASTLE>I just think this is...A little too much.

36
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:32,890
<2-14,MARTHA>是指开销吗
<2-14,MARTHA>In terms of expense?

37
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:34,000
<2-14,MARTHA>应该说是
<2-14,MARTHA>In terms of...

38
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,210
<2-15,CASTLE>各方面
<2-15,CASTLE>E-everything.

39
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:43,600
<2-16,MARTHA>理查德  你为什么对我的主意都不屑一顾呢
<2-16,MARTHA>Richard, why do you just dismiss all of my ideas about your ceremony?

40
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,940
<2-17,CASTLE>你是说用妮基·希特的冰雕做装饰
<2-17,CASTLE>You mean like your ideas of bringing in giant ice sculptures

41
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,780
<2-17,CASTLE>雇佣维也纳童声合唱团
<2-17,CASTLE>of Nikki Heat or hiring the Vienna boys' choir

42
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:50,020
<2-17,CASTLE>让蓝色天使从头顶飞过吗
<2-17,CASTLE>or having the blue angels fly overhead?

43
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,500
<2-18,MARTHA>理查德  我只是想
<2-18,MARTHA>Richard, I'm simply trying to bring

44
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,220
<2-18,MARTHA>让你的婚礼更华丽些
<2-18,MARTHA>a little pageantry into your wedding. But...

45
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:57,640
<2-18,MARTHA>看来你们只想让我做来宾
<2-18,MARTHA>Seems the only role you want me to play is that of guest.

46
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,020
<2-18,MARTHA>好啊  没问题
<2-18,MARTHA>Fine. I can do that.

47
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:05,380
<3-1,CASTLE>我只是让她看看花卉  别弄得太铺张
<3-1,CASTLE>I just asked her to check into flowers and keep it simple.

48
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:08,300
<3-1,CASTLE>就凭她的过去  我该想到的
<3-1,CASTLE>With her track record, I-I s-should've known better.

49
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,740
<3-2,BECKETT>她没有恶意  卡塞尔
<3-2,BECKETT>Look, she means well, Castle.

50
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,330
<3-2,BECKETT>她只是想参与进来
<3-2,BECKETT>She just wants to be a part of this,

51
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:12,840
<3-2,BECKETT>我们找点别的让她做吧
<3-2,BECKETT>so let's find something for her to do...

52
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,380
<3-2,BECKETT>给她个婚礼项目
<3-2,BECKETT>Some kind of a...wedding project.

53
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,390
<3-3,CASTLE>你说得对
<3-3,CASTLE>Yes. You're right,

54
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:19,210
<3-3,CASTLE>但得找个不会被她弄得一团糟的
<3-3,CASTLE>but something she can't turn into an over-the-top disaster.

55
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,320
<3-5,CASTLE>-我再想想  -我也是
<3-5,CASTLE>- I'll keep thinking. - Yeah, me too.

56
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,870
<3-6,JAVIER ESPOSITO>这栋大楼本该进行爆破了
<3-6,JAVIER ESPOSITO>Yo. So, this building was set to be demolished.

57
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,960
<3-6,JAVIER ESPOSITO>可是进行拆卸作业的工程队
<3-6,JAVIER ESPOSITO>That is, until the salvage crew stripping the place

58
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,280
<3-6,JAVIER ESPOSITO>发现了这具尸体
<3-6,JAVIER ESPOSITO>came across this body.

59
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,190
<3-7,KEVIN RYAN>还是埋在水泥里
<3-7,KEVIN RYAN>Buried under concrete, no less.

60
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,180
<3-8,BECKETT>死因知道了吗
<3-8,BECKETT>You got a cause of death?

61
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,730
<3-9,LANIE>我得先做全面尸检  但他可能
<3-9,LANIE>Not till I do a full exam, but he's probably been here

62
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:40,170
<3-9,LANIE>1978年浇筑水泥的时候就在里面了
<3-9,LANIE>since they poured the concrete back in 1978.

63
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:42,390
<3-10,CASTLE>卡特总统时期的死尸
<3-10,CASTLE>A dead man from the Carter administration

64
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:45,100
<3-10,CASTLE>还被埋在水泥里  太有意思了
<3-10,CASTLE>entombed in cement... I am intrigued.

65
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,440
<3-11,BECKETT>还知道死者的什么情况吗
<3-11,BECKETT>Anything else you can tell us about the victim?

66
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,490
<3-12,LANIE>他大概三十出头  衣着不俗
<3-12,LANIE>He was maybe early 30s, and a sharp dresser.

67
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:51,100
<3-12,LANIE>看他的浅灰蓝西装
<3-12,LANIE>Check out that powder-blue suit.

68
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,060
<3-13,BECKETT>是啊  迪斯科时代的装束
<3-13,BECKETT>Yeah, straight from the disco era.

69
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:57,350
<3-14,CASTLE>并且也证实了聚酯材料真的是不可摧毁
<3-14,CASTLE>And a testament to the truly indestructible nature of polyester.

70
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,470
<3-15,RYAN>我们去查查78年时大厦是谁的
<3-15,RYAN>We'll check out who owned the building back in '78

71
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,420
<3-15,RYAN>-现在是谁的  -再查查许可证
<3-15,RYAN>- and who owns it now. - We'll also pull permits,

72
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,490
<3-16,ESPOSITO>看看能不能查到注水泥的是谁
<3-16,ESPOSITO>see if we can track down who poured this concrete.

73
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:08,640
<3-17,CASTLE>我知道他是谁了
<3-17,CASTLE>I know who the victim is.

74
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,380
<3-18,ESPOSITO>什么
<3-18,ESPOSITO>What?

75
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,970
<3-19,CASTLE>30来岁的男人
<3-19,CASTLE>A man in his 30s,

76
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,380
<3-19,CASTLE>喜欢尾戒和沛纳海手表
<3-19,CASTLE>with a penchant for pinkie rings and Panerai watches...

77
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:17,880
<3-19,CASTLE>1978年神秘消失  拜托啊
<3-19,CASTLE>Who mysteriously vanished in 1978. Come on!

78
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:20,760
<3-20,BECKETT>文森·比安奇吗
<3-20,BECKETT>Vince Bianchi?

79
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:23,400
<3-21,LANIE>比安奇犯罪家族的首领
<3-21,LANIE>Head of the Bianchi crime family?

80
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,070
<3-22,CASTLE>而且是当年最有权势  最受人畏惧的黑帮头目
<3-22,CASTLE>And one of the most powerful and feared mafia dons of his day,

81
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:30,470
<3-22,CASTLE>直到他像吉米·霍法一样神秘消失
<3-22,CASTLE>until he disappeared Jimmy Hoffa style.

83
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:33,410
<3-22,CASTLE>这三十多年来  他一直在这儿
<3-22,CASTLE>And for over three decades, he was right here.

84
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,680
<3-22,CASTLE>我们刚刚找到了文森·比安奇
<3-22,CASTLE>We just found Vince Bianchi.

85
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,530
<3-22,CASTLE>文森·比安奇
<3-22,CASTLE>Vince Bianchi,

86
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:41,480
<4-1,DETECTIVE MILT BOYLE>在他变成你们找到的那堆白骨之前
<4-1,DETECTIVE MILT BOYLE>before he turned into the pile of bones you guys found.

87
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:44,870
<4-1,DETECTIVE MILT BOYLE>当时  我们努力想把他抓进监狱
<4-1,DETECTIVE MILT BOYLE>Back then, we were trying to take him off the streets.

88
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:49,100
<4-1,DETECTIVE MILT BOYLE>然后1978年7月30日  有人替我们除掉了他
<4-1,DETECTIVE MILT BOYLE>Then on July 30, 1978, somebody did it for us.

89
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:50,540
<4-2,RYAN>这么大的案子
<4-2,RYAN>High-profile case like this,

90
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,700
<4-2,RYAN>盖茨却偏偏这时候去参加恐怖主义讨论会
<4-2,RYAN>Gates sure did pick the wrong week to go to a terrorism seminar.

91
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,950
<4-3,BECKETT>博伊尔警探
<4-3,BECKETT>Detective Boyle,

92
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:57,330
<4-3,BECKETT>会不会是别的犯罪家族杀了他
<4-3,BECKETT>could one of the other crime families have had him killed?

93
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:58,760
<4-4,BOYLE>这绝对有可能
<4-4,BOYLE>It's definitely possible.

94
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,800
<4-4,BOYLE>刀锋迈奇·卡卡诺
<4-4,BOYLE>"Mickey the Blade" Carcano,

95
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,960
<4-4,BOYLE>利嘴路易·马奈利
<4-4,BOYLE>Louie "The lip" Maneri.

96
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,620
<4-4,BOYLE>都想在比安奇的地盘上插一脚
<4-4,BOYLE>Both wanted to muscle in on Bianchi's territory,

97
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,020
<4-4,BOYLE>所以他们有动机
<4-4,BOYLE>so they had motive.

98
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,910
<4-5,CASTLE>简直像是穿越去了过去
<4-5,CASTLE>It's like being transported to a bygone era.

99
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:12,080
<4-5,CASTLE>刀锋迈奇  利嘴路易
<4-5,CASTLE>Mickey the blade. Louie the lip.

100
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,320
<4-5,CASTLE>这些人现在都在哪啊
<4-5,CASTLE>Where are these guys now?

101
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:15,090
<4-6,BECKETT>可能都在水泥里呢
<4-6,BECKETT>Probably under concrete.

102
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:18,610
<4-7,BOYLE>文森在比安奇家族内也有敌人
<4-7,BOYLE>Vince also had rivals inside the Bianchi family.

103
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,330
<4-8,BECKETT>这些人有嫌疑吗
<4-8,BECKETT>Were any of these rivals suspects?

104
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,860
<4-8,BECKETT>有  这人
<4-8,BECKETT>Yeah, this guy.

105
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,350
<4-9,BOYLE>弗兰克·鲁索  他的副手之一
<4-9,BOYLE>Frank Russo, one of his lieutenants.

106
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:27,280
<4-9,BOYLE>文森失踪后  他接管了比安奇家族
<4-9,BOYLE>He took over the Bianchi family after Vince vanished

107
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,010
<4-9,BOYLE>而且他是最后见到他的人之一
<4-9,BOYLE>and was one of the last people to see him alive.

108
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,520
<4-9,BOYLE>他们那晚在吉诺餐馆一起吃过饭
<4-9,BOYLE>They had dinner together that night at Gino's restaurant.

109
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:36,740
<4-9,BOYLE>店主给弗兰克和文森照了这张相
<4-9,BOYLE>The owner snapped this picture of Frank and Vince...

110
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,880
<4-9,BOYLE>这是文森·比安奇的最后一张照片
<4-9,BOYLE>The last known photo of Vince Bianchi.

111
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:43,220
<4-9,BOYLE>弗兰克称他开车送文森回了家  再就没见到他
<4-9,BOYLE>Frank claimed he drove Vince home and never saw him again.

112
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:45,000
<4-10,CASTLE>你觉得究竟是怎么回事
<4-10,CASTLE>What do you think really happened?

113
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,990
<4-11,BOYLE>我觉得弗兰克劝服文森跟他去城里玩一晚
<4-11,BOYLE>I think Frank talked Vince into a night on the town,

114
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:50,540
<4-11,BOYLE>把他引去了什么地方  杀了他
<4-11,BOYLE>lured him someplace, and killed him.

115
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:52,930
<4-11,BOYLE>但我们始终没能证明
<4-11,BOYLE>But we could never prove it.

116
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,160
<4-12,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你看文森在餐馆穿的那套西服
<4-12,BECKETT>Castle, look at the suit that Vince was wearing at the restaurant.

117
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:58,230
<4-13,CASTLE>是黑色的  不是浅灰蓝的
<4-13,CASTLE>It's black. It's not powder blue.

118
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:00,680
<4-14,BECKETT>那么说他当晚吃完饭的确去了别处
<4-14,BECKETT>So, he did go out after dinner that night.

119
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,020
<4-15,CASTLE>所以弗兰克·鲁索撒谎了
<4-15,CASTLE>And Frank Russo was lying.

120
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,700
<4-16,BECKETT>我们得跟弗兰克·鲁索谈谈
<4-16,BECKETT>We need to talk to Frank Russo.

121
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,870
<5-1,FRANK RUSSO>文森是个好人  安息吧
<5-1,FRANK RUSSO>Vince was a good man. God rest.

122
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,330
<5-1,FRANK RUSSO>至少现在能好好埋葬他了
<5-1,FRANK RUSSO>Now at least he'll get a proper burial.

123
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,210
<5-2,BECKETT>鲁索先生
<5-2,BECKETT>Yeah, Mr. Russo,

124
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,690
<5-2,BECKETT>我们想再问问他失踪那晚的事
<5-2,BECKETT>we'd like to revisit the night that he disappeared.

125
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,480
<5-3,FRANK>那件事都是很多年前了
<5-3,FRANK>Look, that whole thing was ages ago.

126
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,930
<5-4,BECKETT>是的  在那之后
<5-4,BECKETT>Right, and after it happened,

127
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:19,470
<5-4,BECKETT>你接管了比安奇犯罪家族  对吗
<5-4,BECKETT>you took over the Bianchi crime family. Isn't that true?

128
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:21,790
<5-5,FRANK>现在我都做合法生意了
<5-5,FRANK>I'm legit now. I own several businesses.

129
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:22,710
<5-6,MARIE RUSSO>一点没错
<5-6,MARIE RUSSO>Oh, yeah.

130
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,570
<5-6,MARIE RUSSO>就是把你扫地出门的人不要的小生意罢了
<5-6,MARIE RUSSO>Crumbs the family threw you when they shoved you out the door.

131
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,150
<5-7,FRANK>你住的这4000平方英尺的屋子
<5-7,FRANK>Hey, excuse me for making an honest living

132
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,250
<5-7,FRANK>可是这些正经小生意赚来的
<5-7,FRANK>to keep 4,000 square feet over your head!

133
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:33,730
<5-8,MARIE>又不是什么阁楼公寓  对吧弗兰克
<5-8,MARIE>Yeah, but it's not the penthouse, is it, Frank?

134
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:35,420
<5-8,MARIE>不是顶层哦
<5-8,MARIE>It's not the top floor.

135
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:40,690
<5-9,FRANK>你们想干什么
<5-9,FRANK>What are you gonna do?

136
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:42,980
<5-10,BECKETT>请你告诉我们
<5-10,BECKETT>You know, why don't you just walk us through

137
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,650
<5-10,BECKETT>那晚在吉诺餐馆到底发生了什么
<5-10,BECKETT>what happened at Gino's restaurant?

138
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:47,650
<5-11,FRANK>我和文森吃饭闲聊
<5-11,FRANK>Vince and I broke bread, we shot the breeze.

139
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:50,380
<5-11,FRANK>文森谈到了未来  说要安定下来
<5-11,FRANK>Vince talked about the future, settling down,

140
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:53,160
<5-11,FRANK>说黑帮头目一定要重视家庭
<5-11,FRANK>how important it was for a don to be a family man.

141
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:55,840
<5-11,FRANK>晚餐后  我把他送回了家  就这样
<5-11,FRANK>After dinner, I dropped him home. That was it.

142
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,730
<5-12,CASTLE>那之后你再没和文森一起出去
<5-12,CASTLE>And you and Vince didn't go out afterwards?

143
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:59,870
<5-13,FRANK>又来了  我得回答多少次才行  没有
<5-13,FRANK>Again with this? How many times do I got to say it? No.

144
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,320
<5-14,BECKETT>那么他死时穿的衣服为什么
<5-14,BECKETT>Then why was he found in a different suit

145
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,350
<5-14,BECKETT>和在吉诺餐馆穿的不一样
<5-14,BECKETT>than the one that he wore at Gino's restaurant?

146
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:04,760
<5-15,FRANK>我不知道
<5-15,FRANK>I have no idea.

147
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,790
<5-15,FRANK>就算他是出了门  我也不知道
<5-15,FRANK>If he went out after, it's news to me.

148
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,210
<5-15,FRANK>不过如果他真的出去了
<5-15,FRANK>But if he did go out,

149
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:09,830
<5-15,FRANK>哈罗德肯定会知道
<5-15,FRANK>Harold would've known about it.

150
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,110
<5-16,CASTLE>哈罗德是谁
<5-16,CASTLE>Harold?

151
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,220
<5-17,FRANK>哈罗德·利昂
<5-17,FRANK>Harold Leone.

152
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,500
<5-17,FRANK>文森芝麻大的事都会告诉哈罗德
<5-17,FRANK>Vince didn't brush his teeth without talking to Harold.

153
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,290
<6-1,BOYLE>我说弗兰克只是随便给出个名字
<6-1,BOYLE>If you ask me, Frank's just pointing at something shiny

154
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:18,930
<6-1,BOYLE>来转移注意力
<6-1,BOYLE>so you quit looking at him.

155
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:20,050
<6-2,BECKETT>很有可能
<6-2,BECKETT>Yeah, well, that's very possible,

156
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:22,380
<6-2,BECKETT>不过哈罗德·利昂是谁
<6-2,BECKETT>But who is Harold Leone?

157
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:24,840
<6-3,BOYLE>文森的军师  参谋
<6-3,BOYLE>Vince's advisor, his consigliere.

158
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,250
<6-4,CASTLE>就像教父里的汤姆·哈根
<6-4,CASTLE>Like Tom Hagen in "The Godfather."

159
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,360
<6-5,BOYLE>可是文森失踪后
<6-5,BOYLE>Yeah, but after Vince went missing,

160
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,760
<6-5,BOYLE>哈罗德就不怎么出来了
<6-5,BOYLE>Harold kind of dropped off the world.

161
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:32,770
<6-6,BECKETT>-他当时是嫌疑人吗  -不是
<6-6,BECKETT>- Was he ever a suspect? - No.

162
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,610
<6-7,BOYLE>但是流言说他知道内幕
<6-7,BOYLE>But word was he knew things.

163
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,540
<6-8,BECKETT>他现在在哪
<6-8,BECKETT>So, where can we find him now?

164
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,950
<6-9,BOYLE>我应该有他的住址
<6-9,BOYLE>I might have an address in my files.

165
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:42,880
<6-9,BOYLE>打扰一下  夫人
<6-9,BOYLE>Excuse me, ma'am.

166
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:45,200
<7-1,BECKETT>-你好  -纽约警察
<7-1,BECKETT>- Hi. - NYPD.

167
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,300
<7-1,BECKETT>我们来找哈罗德·利昂
<7-1,BECKETT>We're looking for Harold Leone.

168
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,360
<7-1,BECKETT>他住这里对吗
<7-1,BECKETT>Is this where he lives?

169
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,670
<7-2,YVONNE>我是伊凡  哈罗德的保姆
<7-2,YVONNE>Uh, I'm Yvonne. I look after Harold.

170
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:52,220
<7-3,BECKETT>我们想和他聊聊
<7-3,BECKETT>Well, we'd like to speak with him.

171
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,250
<7-3,BECKETT>你确定吗
<7-3,BECKETT>Are you sure about that?

172
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:55,980
<7-4,YVONNE>他内心深处是个好人
<7-4,YVONNE>I mean, he's a sweet man deep down,

173
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,750
<7-4,YVONNE>只是有点不正常
<7-4,YVONNE>but he's just a little off.

174
00:06:58,550 --> 00:06:59,210
<7-5,CASTLE>怎么个不正常法
<7-5,CASTLE>Off how?

175
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,040
<7-6,YVONNE>他们管那叫悲伤过度
<7-6,YVONNE>Pathological grieving is what they call it.

176
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:05,750
<7-6,YVONNE>哈罗德最好的朋友78年失踪了
<7-6,YVONNE>Harold's best friend disappeared back in '78,

177
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,340
<7-6,YVONNE>哈罗德再也没有恢复过来
<7-6,YVONNE>and Harold, he never got over it.

178
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,430
<7-6,YVONNE>他的生活停滞不前了
<7-6,YVONNE>Never moved on.

179
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,120
<7-6,YVONNE>就像被冰封在了过去
<7-6,YVONNE>It's like he's frozen in time.

180
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:13,760
<7-6,YVONNE>所以他整天闷在屋子里  留着这车
<7-6,YVONNE>That's why he stays home and still owns this car

181
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:17,060
<7-6,YVONNE>而且还让我穿这些傻衣服
<7-6,YVONNE>and makes me wear these dumbass clothes.

182
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,540
<7-7,CASTLE>抱歉  你是说哈罗德以为
<7-7,CASTLE>I'm sorry, are you saying that Harold thinks

183
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,870
<7-7,CASTLE>现在还是70年代吗
<7-7,CASTLE>it's the 1970s?

184
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:21,680
<7-7,CASTLE>没错
<7-7,CASTLE>Yeah.

185
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,430
<7-8,YVONNE>而且任何戳穿这个假象的事实
<7-8,YVONNE>And anything that happens that bursts that bubble,

186
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:26,330
<7-8,YVONNE>都会让他陷入混乱
<7-8,YVONNE>oh, he just gets all confused.

187
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:27,660
<7-8,YVONNE>所以你们进去和他说话时
<7-8,YVONNE>So, when you go in to talk to him,

188
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,000
<7-8,YVONNE>得把手机关了
<7-8,YVONNE>just turn off your cellphones,

189
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:31,700
<7-8,YVONNE>假装回到了40年前
<7-8,YVONNE>pretend like it's 40 years ago.

190
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,900
<7-8,YVONNE>其余的就没问题了
<7-8,YVONNE>You shouldn't have any problem.

191
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:37,020
<7-8,YVONNE>不过你可能会有点麻烦
<7-8,YVONNE>Actually, you will have a problem.

192
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,920
<7-8,YVONNE>伊迪丝  我回来啦
<7-8,YVONNE>Edith, I'm home!

193
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:42,090
<7-8,YVONNE>你好  阿奇
<7-8,YVONNE>Oh, hello, Archie!

<8-1,CASTLE>瞧瞧啊
<8-1,CASTLE>Look at this place.

195
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,730
<8-1,CASTLE>哈罗德
<8-1,CASTLE>Harold?!

196
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,550
<8-2,YVONNE>有客人
<8-2,YVONNE>You have guests!

197
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:59,550
<8-3,HAROLD LEONE>这个辣妹愿意整晚待这儿都行
<8-3,HAROLD LEONE>Well, this hot mama could be my guest all night long.

198
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:01,450
<8-4,BECKETT>先生  我是贝克特探长
<8-4,BECKETT>Uh, sir, I'm detective Beckett,

199
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:03,170
<8-4,BECKETT>这位是卡塞尔先生
<8-4,BECKETT>and this is Mr. Castle.

200
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,510
<8-7,HAROLD>-队长  -卡塞尔
<8-7,HAROLD>- Captain. - Castle.

201
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:06,160
<8-7,HAROLD>卡塞尔队长
<8-7,HAROLD>Well, captain Castle,

202
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,300
<8-7,HAROLD>我猜这位小姐是刚来的吧
<8-7,HAROLD>I bet you're, uh, showing this little lady the ropes, huh?

203
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:10,820
<8-7,HAROLD>还在调训中对吧
<8-7,HAROLD>Breaking her in, huh?

204
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:11,910
<8-8,CASTLE>事实上
<8-8,CASTLE>Well, actually, um --

205
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:16,040
<8-9,HAROLD>你见过这么漂亮的美女当警察的吗
<8-9,HAROLD>I mean, have you ever seen a cop with an ass that fine?

206
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,650
<8-9,HAROLD>这就是妇女解放运动吗  那我全力支持
<8-9,HAROLD>If this is women's lib, I'm all for it.

207
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,500
<8-10,BECKETT>什么
<8-10,BECKETT>Excuse me?

208
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:22,450
<8-11,CASTLE>说实话  你确实...当我没说
<8-11,CASTLE>To be fair, you do have a very fine -- never mind.

209
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:24,700
<8-12,HAROLD>需要我做什么  队长
<8-12,HAROLD>So, how can I help you, captain?

210
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:29,920
<8-13,CASTLE>事实上  我们是为文森·比安奇而来
<8-13,CASTLE>Uh, well, truth is, we are here about Vince Bianchi.

211
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:32,170
<8-14,HAROLD>你们找到他了
<8-14,HAROLD>You found him?

212
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:33,490
<8-15,BECKETT>恐怕是的
<8-15,BECKETT>I'm afraid we did.

213
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,840
<8-15,BECKETT>他死时身穿一件浅蓝色西服
<8-15,BECKETT>He was found in a light-blue suit.

214
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:36,840
<8-15,BECKETT>我们认为他被杀当晚
<8-15,BECKETT>We believe he went somewhere

215
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,310
<8-15,BECKETT>从吉诺餐馆回来后又去了别的地方
<8-15,BECKETT>after he left Gino's restaurant the night that he was killed.

216
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:42,550
<8-16,CASTLE>有人说他做什么事都会告诉你
<8-16,CASTLE>Now, we were told he kept you informed about what he did.

217
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,600
<8-16,CASTLE>你知道他那晚去了哪里吗
<8-16,CASTLE>You have any idea where he went that night?

218
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:45,710
<8-16,CASTLE>知道
<8-16,CASTLE>Yeah.

219
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:48,920
<8-17,HAROLD>我也知道是谁杀了他
<8-17,HAROLD>And I know who killed him, too.

229
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,490
<9-1,CASTLE>确认一下
<9-1,CASTLE>Just to be clear,

230
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:01,160
<9-1,CASTLE>你是说你知道杀掉文森·比安奇的凶手
<9-1,CASTLE>you're saying you know who killed Vince Bianchi?

231
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,040
<9-2,BECKETT>他叫什么名字
<9-2,BECKETT>What's his name?

232
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:04,770
<9-3,HAROLD>这个问题太危险了  宝贝
<9-3,HAROLD>That's a dangerous question, sweetheart.

233
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,170
<9-3,HAROLD>我需要保护
<9-3,HAROLD>I'm gonna need protection.

234
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,670
<9-4,BECKETT>必要的话我可以调警员来保护你
<9-4,BECKETT>I can assign officers to protect you if necessary.

235
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,020
<9-4,BECKETT>必要的话
<9-4,BECKETT>"If necessary"?

236
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:11,970
<9-5,HAROLD>能麻烦你告诉这个小甜心
<9-5,HAROLD>Will you tell cupcake here

237
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:16,510
<9-5,HAROLD>我和你们说话都是冒着生命危险吗
<9-5,HAROLD>that -- that I'm risking my life just talking to you guys?

238
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:19,380
<9-5,HAROLD>杀了文森的人随时可能来取我的性命
<9-5,HAROLD>The people that killed Vince will do the same to me in a heartbeat.

239
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,630
<9-6,BECKETT>我觉得真的不太可能
<9-6,BECKETT>I-I think that's really unlikely.

240
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:22,110
<9-6,BECKETT>大多数人都不在了
<9-6,BECKETT>I mean, most of those people aren't even around

241
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:23,090
<9-6,BECKETT>都这么多年了  所以
<9-6,BECKETT>after all these years, so --

242
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:24,430
<9-7,HAROLD>什么这么多年了
<9-7,HAROLD>What do you mean "Years"?

243
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:29,230
<9-7,HAROLD>文森  失踪很多年了吗  不
<9-7,HAROLD>Vince... has not been gone for -- for years. No.

244
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:31,430
<9-8,CASTLE>我想贝克特警探的意思是
<9-8,CASTLE>I'm sure what detective Beckett meant to say --

245
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:32,440
<9-8,CASTLE>这是个骗局
<9-8,CASTLE>This is a trick.

246
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,710
<9-9,HAROLD>你是为了套我的话
<9-9,HAROLD>You are trying to trick me into saying things.

247
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,510
<9-9,HAROLD>或许文森根本没死
<9-9,HAROLD>Maybe Vince isn't even dead.

248
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,900
<9-10,CASTLE>他确实死了
<9-10,CASTLE>No, he most definitely is.

249
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:40,770
<9-11,HAROLD>那就给我看看
<9-11,HAROLD>Well, then show me.

250
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,860
<9-11,HAROLD>要我告诉你是谁杀了他
<9-11,HAROLD>If I'm gonna tell you who killed him,

251
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,670
<9-11,HAROLD>就得先让我见到尸体
<9-11,HAROLD>I need to see his face first.

252
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,950
<9-12,BECKETT>抱歉  哈罗德  这恐怕不可能
<9-12,BECKETT>I'm sorry, Harold, but that's impossible.

253
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:48,650
<9-12,BECKETT>为什么
<9-12,BECKETT>Why?

254
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:51,590
<9-13,HAROLD>你说他死了  那就让我见到尸体
<9-13,HAROLD>If Vince is dead, show me his body!

255
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:54,770
<9-15,HAROLD>-哈罗德  -没见到尸体我什么也不说
<9-15,HAROLD>- Harold -- - No body, no talkie.

256
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,570
<9-15,HAROLD>先生
<9-15,HAROLD>Sir.

257
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,580
<9-16,CASTLE>我以纽约警察赋予我的权力向您保证
<9-16,CASTLE>By the power vested in me by the NYPD,

258
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:02,590
<9-16,CASTLE>我会亲自安排你去探视死者
<9-16,CASTLE>I will personally arrange for you to view the deceased.

259
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,540
<9-17,HAROLD>你是一个讲信用的人  队长
<9-17,HAROLD>You are a man of honor, captain.

260
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,690
<9-18,BECKETT>能出来谈谈吗  队长
<9-18,BECKETT>Can we speak outside... captain?

261
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:13,600
<9-19,CASTLE>当然
<9-19,CASTLE>Of course.

262
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:15,670
<9-19,CASTLE>新手嘛
<9-19,CASTLE>Rookies.

263
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:17,840
<10-1,BECKETT>"赋予我的权力"
<10-1,BECKETT>"By the power vested in me"?

264
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,320
<10-1,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你在干什么
<10-1,BECKETT>Castle, what the hell were you doing?

265
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,910
<10-2,CASTLE>是你说漏了嘴
<10-2,CASTLE>I was trying to stop the meltdown he had

266
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,230
<10-2,CASTLE>我只是不想让他崩溃
<10-2,CASTLE>when you steped out of the '70s.

267
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:24,570
<10-3,BECKETT>就答应让他看根本就没有的尸体
<10-3,BECKETT>By promising him a body that we don't have.

268
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:27,380
<10-4,CASTLE>他能帮我们解决著名的黑帮残杀的案子
<10-4,CASTLE>He can help us solve an infamous gangland slaying.

269
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,560
<10-5,BECKETT>或许他是在幻想
<10-5,BECKETT>Maybe he's delusional.

270
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,770
<10-5,BECKETT>我们都知道他弄不清楚年代
<10-5,BECKETT>We already know he's delusional about what year it is.

271
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:33,640
<10-6,CASTLE>要得到他知道的消息  得让他相信我们
<10-6,CASTLE>If we're gonna find out what he knows, he has to trust us.

272
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,100
<10-6,CASTLE>他得先看到一具尸体
<10-6,CASTLE>He needs to see a body.

273
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:38,230
<10-7,BECKETT>蕾妮在停尸房找到线索了
<10-7,BECKETT>Lanie's got something at the morgue.

274
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,680
<10-8,CASTLE>你知道她还有什么吗  尸体
<10-8,CASTLE>You know what else she's got? Bodies.

275
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,460
<10-8,CASTLE>很多的尸体
<10-8,CASTLE>Lots of them.

276
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,220
<10-8,CASTLE>可能有一具看上去够像文森·比安奇
<10-8,CASTLE>Maybe one of them looks enough like Vince Bianchi.

277
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:45,000
<10-9,BECKETT>想都别想  小甜心
<10-9,BECKETT>Don't even go there, cupcake.

278
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,560
<11-1,RYAN>你就是这么查那栋楼的主人的
<11-1,RYAN>This you checking out who owns that building?

279
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:52,830
<11-2,ESPOSITO>我在等档案组的电话
<11-2,ESPOSITO>I'm waiting on a call from records.

280
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,130
<11-2,ESPOSITO>所以我顺便了解一下那个年代的东西
<11-2,ESPOSITO>So I figured I'd study up on the period,

281
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:56,350
<11-4,ESPOSITO>就从这个
<11-4,ESPOSITO>by starting...

282
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,000
<11-4,ESPOSITO>我找到的纪录片开始
<11-4,ESPOSITO>with this documentary I found

283
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,970
<11-4,ESPOSITO>关于当时两个彪悍的纽约警局警探
<11-4,ESPOSITO>on these two NYPD badasses from back in the day.

284
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:05,200
<11-4,ESPOSITO>斯努基·沃兹还有雷·普莱斯
<11-4,ESPOSITO>Snookie Watts, Ray Price.

285
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,680
<11-4,ESPOSITO>快看斯努基这一段的动作
<11-4,ESPOSITO>Check out Snookie's move right here.

286
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,170
<11-5,NARRATOR>斯努基  你和雷
<11-5,NARRATOR>Snookie, you and Ray

287
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,710
<11-5,NARRATOR>在打击罪案小组可是名声大噪
<11-5,NARRATOR>have made quite a name for yourselves in the anti-crime unit.

288
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:13,840
<11-6,SNOOKIE>就是这样的  宝贝
<11-6,SNOOKIE>Better believe it, baby.

289
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,810
<11-6,SNOOKIE>打击犯罪一打一个准
<11-6,SNOOKIE>Stopping crime one skell at a time.

290
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,100
<11-7,RAY>没错  没错
<11-7,RAY>Right on, right on.

291
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,980
<11-7,RAY>坏人看到飞驰的红色跑车
<11-7,RAY>See, when the bad guys see the ol' red rocket here,

292
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:22,490
<11-7,RAY>就知道自己离死期不远了
<11-7,RAY>they know a serious head cracking is on the way.

293
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,150
<11-8,RYAN>过去警察暴力的好日子
<11-8,RYAN>So, good ol' days of police brutality.

294
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,240
<11-9,ESPOSITO>伙计  你不懂
<11-9,ESPOSITO>Man, you just don't get it.

295
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:34,750
<12-1,LANIE>看上去我们的被害人是身中数枪而死
<12-1,LANIE>So, it looks like our victim was killed by multiple gunshot wounds.

296
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,060
<12-1,LANIE>我把他的头骨拼好时
<12-1,LANIE>When I pieced his skull back together,

297
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:39,670
<12-1,LANIE>我看到这个38口径手枪打出来的入口伤
<12-1,LANIE>I found this entry wound from a .38.

298
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,810
<12-2,CASTLE>正中脑门
<12-2,CASTLE>One in the noggin.

299
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:42,420
<12-2,CASTLE>典型的黑帮杀人风格
<12-2,CASTLE>Classic mafia rubout.

300
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,560
<12-3,LANIE>也不尽然
<12-3,LANIE>Not exactly.

301
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,980
<12-3,LANIE>据我观察
<12-3,LANIE>As near as I can figure,

302
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,640
<12-3,LANIE>他是先被射中了后背
<12-3,LANIE>Vince was shot in the back first,

303
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:47,980
<12-3,LANIE>可能他正准备离开
<12-3,LANIE>Maybe as he was walking away.

304
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,760
<12-3,LANIE>他的腹部有一个出口伤
<12-3,LANIE>There's an exit wound in his abdomen.

305
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:53,000
<12-4,BECKETT>腹部  你光凭骨头就发现了这些
<12-4,BECKETT>In his abdomen? You got all of that from bones?

306
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:54,900
<12-5,LANIE>我从这东西上获得了些帮助
<12-5,LANIE>I got a little help from this.

307
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,940
<12-5,LANIE>水泥在他身上凝结时
<12-5,LANIE>When the concrete settled on him,

308
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,830
<12-5,LANIE>就形成了一个非常棒的模子
<12-5,LANIE>it formed an almost perfect mold.

309
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:04,330
<12-5,LANIE>我们就做了一个他身体的模型
<12-5,LANIE>We were able to make a cast of the body

310
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,250
<12-5,LANIE>从模型上能看出出口伤
<12-5,LANIE>which showed the exit wound.

311
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,110
<12-6,CASTLE>我们有尸体了
<12-6,CASTLE>We have a body.

312
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,440
<12-6,CASTLE>我们能让哈罗德看尸体了
<12-6,CASTLE>We have a body to show Harold.

313
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,310
<12-6,CASTLE>这就是让他开口的东西
<12-6,CASTLE>This is exactly what we need to get him to talk.

314
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:13,420
<12-7,BECKETT>卡塞尔  这是橡胶的
<12-7,BECKETT>Castle. It's rubber!

315
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,890
<12-8,CASTLE>他不需要知道这个
<12-8,CASTLE>He doesn't need to know that.

316
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:16,820
<12-8,CASTLE>找个熟练的入殓师
<12-8,CASTLE>Couldn't a skilled mortician

317
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,580
<12-8,CASTLE>给它弄点头发化个妆
<12-8,CASTLE>apply a little hair and makeup to this,

318
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:21,400
<12-8,CASTLE>让这看起来像是文森·比安奇行吗
<12-8,CASTLE>make it look like a reasonable facsimile of vince bianchi?

319
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,800
<12-9,LANIE>我见过他们完成更困难的事
<12-9,LANIE>I've seen them do more with a lot less,

320
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,750
<12-9,LANIE>但我可不想掺和进来
<12-9,LANIE>but I don't want to be a part of some crazy plan --

321
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,200
<12-10,CASTLE>你必须参与  为了让计划成功
<12-10,CASTLE>Yeah, you have to, because for this to work,

322
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:32,150
<12-10,CASTLE>这个地方得弄得像70年代  你也是
<12-10,CASTLE>this place needs to look like the'70s, and so do you.

323
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,100
<13-1,RYAN>马奈利先生
<13-1,RYAN>So, Mr. Maneri,

324
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:38,640
<13-1,RYAN>既然文森·比安奇是死于谋杀
<13-1,RYAN>now that Vince Bianchi's death is officially a homicide,

325
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:42,020
<13-1,RYAN>我们必须盘查他之前所有的敌对者
<13-1,RYAN>we are re-interviewing all of his former enemies,

326
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,740
<13-1,RYAN>其中也包括你
<13-1,RYAN>including yourself.

327
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,790
<13-1,RYAN>你能不能告诉我们
<13-1,RYAN>Now, is it possible for you to tell me

328
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:49,900
<13-1,RYAN>1978年7月30日你在哪
<13-1,RYAN>where you were on July 30, 1978?

329
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,550
<13-2,DEANNA MANERI>我可以代表我丈夫利嘴路易说
<13-2,DEANNA MANERI>I speak for my husband, Louie the Lip here,

330
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:57,790
<13-2,DEANNA MANERI>他没有参与干掉文森·比安奇
<13-2,DEANNA MANERI>when I tell you that he had no part in whackin' Vince Bianchi.

331
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:00,590
<13-2,DEANNA MANERI>即使他做了  他也不记得了
<13-2,DEANNA MANERI>And even if he did, he doesn't remember.

332
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,380
<13-3,LOUIE MANERI>就是她说的那样
<13-3,LOUIE MANERI>What she said.

333
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,700
<13-4,DEANNA>医生怎么跟你说的
<13-4,DEANNA>What did the doctor tell you?

334
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,490
<13-4,DEANNA>你要干嘛  让我变寡妇吗
<13-4,DEANNA>What are you trying to do? Make me a widow?

335
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:09,990
<13-4,DEANNA>你跟医生说过你不会再这么做了
<13-4,DEANNA>You promised the doctor not to do that anymore.

336
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,910
<13-5,ESPOSITO>你们俩能回避一下吗  谢谢
<13-5,ESPOSITO>Could you two excuse me for a minute, please? Thanks.

337
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:13,620
<13-6,DEANNA>这样你会早早进坟墓的
<13-6,DEANNA>You're gonna put yourself in an early grave.

338
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,530
<13-7,RYAN>哥们  这个案子弄得我快没招了
<13-7,RYAN>Man, I'm spinning my wheels on this thing.

339
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,850
<13-7,RYAN>每个和案子有关的人要么死了
<13-7,RYAN>Everyone connected to this case is either dead

340
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:19,440
<13-7,RYAN>要么就像利嘴路易那样
<13-7,RYAN>or looks like Louie the Lip over there.

341
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:22,010
<13-7,RYAN>那个哈罗德可能是我们唯一的机会
<13-7,RYAN>This guy Harold might be our only shot at solving this thing.

342
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,900
<13-8,ESPOSITO>什么  那个活在70年代的疯子
<13-8,ESPOSITO>What, the kook who thinks it's the '70s?

343
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,380
<13-8,ESPOSITO>不可能  兄弟  我找到一条线索
<13-8,ESPOSITO>No way, bro. I just got us a real lead.

344
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,530
<13-9,RYAN>和那栋楼的主人有关吗
<13-9,RYAN>Connected to who owns the building?

345
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:28,540
<13-10,ESPOSITO>差不多
<13-10,ESPOSITO>Well, sort of.

346
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:30,410
<13-10,ESPOSITO>原来在70年代
<13-10,ESPOSITO>Turns out that back in the '70s,

347
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:33,260
<13-10,ESPOSITO>黑帮插手了市内所有的建筑工程
<13-10,ESPOSITO>the mob had a piece of all the concrete work in the city.

348
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:35,030
<13-10,ESPOSITO>这些工程被划分给了不同的犯罪组织
<13-10,ESPOSITO>It was divvied up so that different crime families

349
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,460
<13-10,ESPOSITO>他们分管不同的区域
<13-10,ESPOSITO>controlled different parts of town.

350
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:39,250
<13-10,ESPOSITO>埋着文森的那块混凝土
<13-10,ESPOSITO>Now, the concrete that Vince was found under

351
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,460
<13-10,ESPOSITO>刚好处于卡卡诺家族的领地中心
<13-10,ESPOSITO>was smack-dab in the middle of Carcano territory.

352
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:44,550
<13-11,RYAN>而卡卡诺家族是文森当时的头号劲敌
<13-11,RYAN>And the Carcanos were Vince's chief rivals back in the day.

353
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:45,780
<13-11,RYAN>他们中还有人活着吗
<13-11,RYAN>Are any of them still alive?

354
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,890
<13-12,ESPOSITO>迈克尔·卡卡诺
<13-12,ESPOSITO>Michael Carcano.

355
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,050
<13-12,ESPOSITO>他那时是家族的头目  现在也还是
<13-12,ESPOSITO>He was head of the family then. He still is today.

356
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,710
<14-1,MICHAEL CARCANO>我来只是出于对文森·比安奇的尊重
<14-1,MICHAEL CARCANO>I'm only here out of respect for Vince Bianchi.

357
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,300
<14-1,MICHAEL CARCANO>我还是1978年的那句话
<14-1,MICHAEL CARCANO>And I'll say now what I said in '78.

358
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,140
<14-1,MICHAEL CARCANO>我没有杀他
<14-1,MICHAEL CARCANO>It wasn't me who did him.

359
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:01,670
<14-2,ESPOSITO>是吗  我们在你的工程下发现了他
<14-2,ESPOSITO>Really? Because we found him under your concrete.

360
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:04,730
<14-3,CARCANO>什么  我会在自己后院埋尸体吗
<14-3,CARCANO>What, I'm gonna bury a body in my own backyard?

361
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:08,300
<14-3,CARCANO>此外我要是想让人消失  那人就不会被发现
<14-3,CARCANO>Plus, if I had someone disappear, they'd stay that way.

362
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:10,090
<14-4,RYAN>的确如此  如果不是有开发商
<14-4,RYAN>Well, he did... until a developer

363
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:11,890
<14-4,RYAN>要拆掉那栋楼也不会有人发现
<14-4,RYAN>decided to tear down that building.

364
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,370
<14-4,RYAN>我们知道你想侵占文森的领地
<14-4,RYAN>We know that you wanted in on Vince's territory.

365
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:16,180
<14-5,CARCANO>有件事你并不清楚
<14-5,CARCANO>Well, here's something you don't know.

366
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,790
<14-5,CARCANO>我们那时候正在协商合并的事
<14-5,CARCANO>Me and him were in talks to merge the families.

367
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:23,630
<14-5,CARCANO>这样对双方都有好处
<14-5,CARCANO>It was a beneficial deal for both sides.

368
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,340
<14-5,CARCANO>合并失败会影响生意
<14-5,CARCANO>Losing that merger was bad for business,

369
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,190
<14-5,CARCANO>为什么我要灭了他呢
<14-5,CARCANO>so why should I want to get rid of him?

370
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,030
<14-6,ESPOSITO>也许是因为你想独吞好处
<14-6,ESPOSITO>Maybe because you wanted the whole pie

371
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:33,150
<14-6,ESPOSITO>而不是和人分一杯羹
<14-6,ESPOSITO>instead of just a bigger slice.

372
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:36,810
<14-7,CARCANO>如果你们还有什么问题
<14-7,CARCANO>If you boys have any more questions,

373
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:38,690
<14-7,CARCANO>跟我的律师去说
<14-7,CARCANO>talk to my attorney.

374
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:43,750
<14-7,CARCANO>要知道过去这么久  是很难找到真相的
<14-7,CARCANO>You know, after this long, the truth is hard to find.

375
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,480
<14-7,CARCANO>我要是你们  就不找了
<14-7,CARCANO>If I was you, I'd quit looking for it.

376
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:49,600
<14-7,CARCANO>有时候过去的事情就该让它过去
<14-7,CARCANO>Sometimes what's in the past should stay there.

377
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:52,960
<14-8,RYAN>你这是威胁吗
<14-8,RYAN>Is that a threat?

378
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:56,340
<14-9,CARCANO>你觉得呢
<14-9,CARCANO>What do you think?

379
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,670
<15-1,BECKETT>我这身衣服太蠢了
<15-1,BECKETT>I look ridiculous!

380
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,720
<15-2,CASTLE>蠢得性感
<15-2,CASTLE>Ridiculously hot.

381
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,800
<15-2,CASTLE>况且  如果能查出
<15-2,CASTLE>Besides, what's a little humiliation

382
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,700
<15-2,CASTLE>是谁杀了文森·比安奇  这点屈辱算什么
<15-2,CASTLE>when you can find out who killed Vince Bianchi?

383
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,040
<15-3,HAROLD>好了  文森在哪
<15-3,HAROLD>All right, so, where is Vince?

384
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:12,050
<15-4,BECKETT>他在这里
<15-4,BECKETT>He's in here.

385
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:14,520
<15-5,CASTLE>但愿蕾妮能演好她的部分
<15-5,CASTLE>Just hope Lanie did her part.

386
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,720
<16-1,HAROLD>她演得很好
<16-1,HAROLD>Oh, she did her part, all right.

387
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:22,680
<16-2,BECKETT>亲爱的  转个圈  让我看看你的翘臀
<16-2,BECKETT>Honey, spin around. Show me that caboose.

388
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,420
<16-3,HAROLD>你就做梦吧  老先生
<16-3,HAROLD>You keep dreaming, mister.

389
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:25,840
<16-4,LANIE>她穿的是什么
<16-4,LANIE>What is she wearing?

390
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,170
<16-5,CASTLE>我是让她穿成70年代  不是帕姆·格莱尔
<16-5,CASTLE>I said '70s, not Pam Grier.

392
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,980
<16-6,BECKETT>她唯一一件70年代的衣服
<16-6,BECKETT>The only '70s outfit she had

393
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:32,260
<16-6,BECKETT>是万圣节的骚狐狸布朗的装束
<16-6,BECKETT>was her "Foxy Brown" Halloween costume.

395
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:33,330
<16-7,HAROLD>来吧  宝贝
<16-7,HAROLD>Come on, baby.

396
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:35,740
<16-7,HAROLD>上过一次白人  就欲罢不能了
<16-7,HAROLD>Once you go white, nothing else seems right.

397
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:40,520
<16-8,LANIE>我宁愿死也不上你的床  老混蛋
<16-8,LANIE>I'd rather be dead than end up in your bed, jive turkey.

398
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,950
<16-9,BECKETT>好了  别再说了
<16-9,BECKETT>Okay, that's enough.

399
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:44,210
<16-10,HAROLD>-帕里什医生  -她还是个医生
<16-10,HAROLD>- Dr. Parish. - She's a doctor, too.

400
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,830
<16-10,HAROLD>这么说她肯定知道...
<16-10,HAROLD>Whoa, that means she sure knows her way around...

401
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:56,970
<16-11,CASTLE>怎样
<16-11,CASTLE>Well?

402
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,550
<16-11,CASTLE>哈罗德
<16-11,CASTLE>Harold?

403
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:00,920
<16-12,BECKETT>我们已经履行了我们的承诺
<16-12,BECKETT>We kept our end of the bargain.

404
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:05,320
<16-13,HAROLD>他身上还有什么别的东西吗
<16-13,HAROLD>Was there anything else on him?

405
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:06,510
<16-13,HAROLD>他的东西
<16-13,HAROLD>Any of his stuff?

406
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,150
<16-14,LANIE>一枚尾戒  一块手表
<16-14,LANIE>A pinkie ring, a watch...

407
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,600
<16-14,LANIE>还有这个
<16-14,LANIE>And this.

408
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:15,500
<16-14,LANIE>这是康尼岛上的那种硬币
<16-14,LANIE>It's one of those pressed pennies from Coney Island.

410
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,240
<17-1,BECKETT>你说过会告诉我们的
<17-1,BECKETT>You said that you'd talk to us.

411
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:37,090
<17-2,HAROLD>文森总是带着那玩意以求好运
<17-2,HAROLD>Vince always carried that coin for luck.

412
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:41,290
<17-2,HAROLD>现在看见他  我也说不清楚
<17-2,HAROLD>Seeing him there... I don't know.

413
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,340
<17-2,HAROLD>我突然意识到他是真的死了
<17-2,HAROLD>It just hit me that he's really gone.

414
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:48,180
<17-3,CASTLE>哈罗德  我们知道这很难
<17-3,CASTLE>Harold, we know this is hard.

415
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:52,950
<17-3,CASTLE>我们需要你帮忙将杀死文森的凶手绳之以法
<17-3,CASTLE>We need you to help us bring Vince's killer to justice.

416
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,640
<17-4,BECKETT>趴下  趴下
<17-4,BECKETT>Get down! Get down!

417
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,410
<17-4,BECKETT>好的  谢了
<17-4,BECKETT>Okay. Thanks.

418
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:11,390
<18-1,BECKETT>刚才发生的是真的吗
<18-1,BECKETT>Did this really just happen?

419
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,980
<18-2,LANIE>在我停尸房里的黑帮袭击
<18-2,LANIE>An attempted mob hit in my morgue?

420
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,970
<18-3,BECKETT>蕾妮  这次没人受伤纯粹是运气好
<18-3,BECKETT>Lanie, it was pure luck that no one got hurt.

421
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,010
<39-3,FRANK>哈罗德怎么样了
<39-3,FRANK>How's Harold?

422
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:17,900
<18-4,LANIE>卡塞尔送他回家了
<18-4,LANIE>Castle took him home.

423
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:19,530
<18-5,BECKETT>我们已经派警察保护他了
<18-5,BECKETT>We've got him under police protection.

424
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:22,510
<18-6,ESPOSITO>贝克特  我听说了发生的事
<18-6,ESPOSITO>Yo, Beckett. I heard what happ-- whoa.

425
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:25,150
<18-7,LANIE>什么也别说
<18-7,LANIE>Don't you say another word.

426
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,810
<18-8,RYAN>看来是职业枪手
<18-8,RYAN>Hey. Looks like our shooter was a pro.

427
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,830
<18-8,RYAN>他从楼梯跑了  而且把门闩上了
<18-8,RYAN>He left by the stairs, and he barred the door.

428
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:31,030
<18-8,RYAN>他早就做好了逃跑准备
<18-8,RYAN>He had an exit plan.

429
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,010
<18-9,BECKETT>有目击者吗
<18-9,BECKETT>Any witnesses see him?

430
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,600
<18-10,RYAN>有  但是他戴着口罩
<18-10,RYAN>Yeah, but he was wearing that mask,

431
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,390
<18-10,RYAN>所以没人看清他的脸
<18-10,RYAN>So no one got a good look at his face,

432
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:38,490
<18-10,RYAN>不过他可能是迈克尔·卡卡诺派来的
<18-10,RYAN>But he might have been sent by Michael Carcano.

433
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:41,330
<18-10,RYAN>卡卡诺刚刚警告我和哈维不要插手这案子  对吧
<18-10,RYAN>Carcano just warned me and Javi off the case. Right, Javi?

434
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,430
<18-11,ESPOSITO>抱歉  你说什么
<18-11,ESPOSITO>I'm sorry. What?

435
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:44,820
<18-12,BECKETT>查查大楼外的监控录像
<18-12,BECKETT>Check the security cameras outside the building.

436
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:45,850
<18-12,BECKETT>如果我们能确认枪手的身份
<18-12,BECKETT>If we can I.D. the shooter,

437
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,130
<18-12,BECKETT>或许我们就能把他和卡卡诺
<18-12,BECKETT>maybe we can tie him to Carcano

438
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,100
<18-12,BECKETT>或者真正的幕后主使联系起来
<18-12,BECKETT>or whoever else was behind this.

439
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:51,320
<18-13,RYAN>衣服不错
<18-13,RYAN>Nice dress.

440
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,700
<19-1,RYAN>托瑞  有什么发现
<19-1,RYAN>Hey, Tory. What do you got?

441
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:58,000
<19-2,TORY ELLIS>我在看停尸房周围的交通录像发现了这个
<19-2,TORY ELLIS>I was checking traffic cam footage near the morgue and found this.

442
00:17:58,450 --> 00:17:59,600
<19-2,TORY ELLIS>这就是枪手
<19-2,TORY ELLIS>Here's our shooter.

443
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,820
<19-2,TORY ELLIS>在半个街区之外
<19-2,TORY ELLIS>It's half a block away.

444
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,570
<19-2,TORY ELLIS>他一定是从停尸房的后门出来的
<19-2,TORY ELLIS>He must have come out the rear exit of the morgue.

445
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:04,940
<19-2,TORY ELLIS>看  他摘掉了口罩
<19-2,TORY ELLIS>Now watch. He takes off his mask.

446
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:09,930
<19-3,RYAN>把这张照片发给有组织犯罪调查科
<19-3,RYAN>Send this image to Organized Crime.

447
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:11,120
<19-3,RYAN>或许他们能认出他
<19-3,RYAN>Maybe they can I.D. him.

448
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:14,680
<19-3,RYAN>有组织犯罪调查科里没人能认出他来
<19-3,RYAN>So, nobody in Organized Crime could tell us who he is?

449
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,580
<20-1,BECKETT>是的  你看看他
<20-1,BECKETT>No, but look at him.

450
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:17,100
<20-2,RYAN>他和文森是同一代的人
<20-2,RYAN>He's from the same generation as Vince.

451
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,110
<20-2,RYAN>或许他参与了一开始的那个案子
<20-2,RYAN>Maybe he was even involved in the original hit.

452
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:20,150
<20-3,ESPOSITO>无论怎样  有组织犯罪调查科
<20-3,ESPOSITO>Either way, Organized Crime

453
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:22,080
<20-3,ESPOSITO>说枪手可能是从外地来的
<20-3,ESPOSITO>said that our shooter might've been brought from out of town

454
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,030
<20-3,ESPOSITO>这样我们就没法把他跟雇他的人联系起来了
<20-3,ESPOSITO>so that he couldn't be linked back to whoever hired him.

455
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:26,040
<20-4,RYAN>我们把照片发了出去  也发了全境通告
<20-4,RYAN>We're circulating the photo, and we already got an APB.

456
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,170
<20-5,BECKETT>让联调局也查查
<20-5,BECKETT>Let's run it past FBI, too.

457
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:30,620
<20-5,BECKETT>如果他是从外地来的  或许他们能认识他
<20-5,BECKETT>If he's from out of town, maybe they'll recognize him.

458
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,220
<20-6,ESPOSITO>已经做了  但是我们现在需要的
<20-6,ESPOSITO>We're already on it, but what we really need

459
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,570
<20-6,ESPOSITO>是让哈罗德告诉我们他所知道的
<20-6,ESPOSITO>is for your boy Harold to tell us what he knows.

460
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:36,540
<21-1,HAROLD>我刚才就是个活靶子
<21-1,HAROLD>I was like a sitting duck in there.

461
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,870
<21-1,HAROLD>你怎么能让这种事发生
<21-1,HAROLD>How could you let this happen?

462
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:39,500
<21-1,HAROLD>你算个什么警察
<21-1,HAROLD>What kind of a cop are you, anyway?

463
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,130
<21-2,CASTLE>哈罗德  我们正在尽力抓捕那个枪手
<21-2,CASTLE>Harold, we're doing everything we can to bring in the gunman.

464
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:43,790
<21-3,HAROLD>这就是我当告密者的下场
<21-3,HAROLD>This is what I get for being a snitch.

465
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,500
<21-4,CASTLE>准确来说  你不是个泄密者
<21-4,CASTLE>Well, technically, you're not a snitch

466
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,640
<21-4,CASTLE>因为你目前还什么都没告诉我们
<21-4,CASTLE>because you haven't actually told us anything yet.

467
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,170
<21-5,HAROLD>但是他们又不知道
<21-5,HAROLD>Well, they don't know that.

468
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,210
<21-6,CASTLE>是的  他们不知道
<21-6,CASTLE>No. They don't.

469
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,910
<21-6,CASTLE>他们认为你全都交代了
<21-6,CASTLE>They figure you're singing like a canary.

470
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:54,830
<21-7,HAROLD>你是想让我感觉好一些吗
<21-7,HAROLD>Are you trying to make me feel better?

471
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,380
<21-7,HAROLD>你所说的可一点没用
<21-7,HAROLD>Because this is not helping!

472
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:59,360
<21-8,BECKETT>我是想让你明白你把实情说出来
<21-8,BECKETT>I'm trying to show you you've got nothing to lose

473
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,340
<21-8,BECKETT>对你有益无害
<21-8,BECKETT>and everything to gain by coming clean.

474
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,360
<21-8,BECKETT>告诉我们幕后主使是谁
<21-8,BECKETT>Tell us who's behind this,

475
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,490
<21-8,BECKETT>我们可以去抓那人  确保你的安全
<21-8,BECKETT>We can go after them and keep you safe!

476
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:06,940
<21-8,BECKETT>好吧
<21-8,BECKETT>All right.

477
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:10,980
<21-9,HAROLD>我会告诉你们我所知道的一切
<21-9,HAROLD>I'll tell you everything I know.

478
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,750
<21-10,HAROLD>我们去警局正式录份口供
<21-10,HAROLD>Let's go down to the precinct and make it official.

479
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:15,160
<22-2,CASTLE>-警局  -是的
<22-2,CASTLE>- Precinct? - Yeah.

480
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,130
<22-3,BECKETT>警局
<22-3,BECKETT>The precinct.

481
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:19,230
<21-12,HAROLD>我看到周围有警察会觉得安全一些
<21-12,HAROLD>I'm -- I'm gonna feel a little safer with all those cops around.

482
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:21,420
<21-13,CASTLE>为什么不能在这里说呢
<21-13,CASTLE>Well, why can't we do it here?

483
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:23,580
<21-14,HAROLD>为什么不能在那里说呢
<21-14,HAROLD>Why can't we do it there?

484
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,520
<22-1,BECKETT>我告诉你为什么不行
<22-1,BECKETT>I will tell you why not.

485
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,000
<22-1,BECKETT>因为一旦哈罗德来到这里
<22-1,BECKETT>Because the second Harold sets foot in this place,

486
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,560
<22-1,BECKETT>他的70年代幻想就会破灭
<22-1,BECKETT>it will burst his little 70's bubble.

487
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:35,550
<22-2,CASTLE>如果这里也像70年代一样就行了
<22-2,CASTLE>It won't burst his bubble if it...looks like the 70's.

488
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,990
<22-3,BECKETT>你不会是说我们要重新装饰警局吧
<22-3,BECKETT>You cannot be suggesting that we redecorate the precinct.

489
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:41,080
<22-4,CASTLE>这里的框架还是可以的
<22-4,CASTLE>The bare bones of this place will totally work.

490
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,500
<22-4,CASTLE>我们只需要把电脑搬走
<22-4,CASTLE>We just need to take away the computers

491
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,360
<22-4,CASTLE>然后放上打字机
<22-4,CASTLE>and put back the typewriters.

492
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,460
<22-5,BECKETT>不  不行  绝对不行
<22-5,BECKETT>No! No, absolutely not.

493
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,920
<22-5,BECKETT>有人想杀死哈罗德
<22-5,BECKETT>People tried to kill Harold

494
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:49,130
<22-6,CASTLE>因为他知道是谁谋杀了文森
<22-6,CASTLE>because he knows who murdered Vince.

495
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:53,160
<22-6,CASTLE>这是让他开口的唯一方法
<22-6,CASTLE>This is the only way we can get him to talk to us.

496
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:55,110
<22-6,CASTLE>他是我们的唯一线索
<22-6,CASTLE>He's the only lead we have.

497
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:57,060
<22-7,BECKETT>盖茨警监绝对不会同意的
<22-7,BECKETT>Captain Gates will never go for it.

498
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:59,300
<22-8,CASTLE>盖茨警监现在不在  你是老大
<22-8,CASTLE>Captain Gates isn't here. You're in charge.

499
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:01,020
<22-9,BECKETT>那其他的警察怎么办
<22-9,BECKETT>And what about all the other cops?

500
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,410
<22-9,BECKETT>他们的警服就会露馅
<22-9,BECKETT>Their clothes are a dead giveaway.

501
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:06,120
<22-10,CASTLE>不会的  假如你以上级的身份
<22-10,CASTLE>Not if you, as ranking officer,

502
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:09,500
<22-10,CASTLE>命令他们穿成70年代的样子来上班
<22-10,CASTLE>order them to come to work dressed in 1970s clothing.

503
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,020
<22-12,CASTLE>-什么  -我已经在服装店开好账户了
<22-12,CASTLE>- What?! - I have opened an account at a costume shop --

504
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,700
<22-12,CASTLE>价格可不便宜
<22-12,CASTLE>At no small expense.

505
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,660
<22-12,CASTLE>他们会提供70年代的警察制服
<22-12,CASTLE>They're gonna help us in our little endeavour

506
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,440
<22-12,CASTLE>来帮助我们实现这个计划
<22-12,CASTLE>by providing 1970s police uniforms.

507
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,060
<22-13,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<22-13,BECKETT>Castle --

508
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:21,240
<22-14,CASTLE>也不算太麻烦
<22-14,CASTLE>This will be a minor disruption.

509
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,160
<22-14,CASTLE>我们只需把哈罗德要经过的办公室
<22-14,CASTLE>We redress the squad room just long enough

510
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:28,850
<22-14,CASTLE>重新装饰  让他感觉到70年代的气氛
<22-14,CASTLE>to walk Harold through, let him dig on that '70s vibe,

511
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:31,110
<22-14,CASTLE>然后他就会给我们录口供了
<22-14,CASTLE>and then he gives us a statement.

512
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,490
<22-14,CASTLE>成功过一次  这次也会的
<22-14,CASTLE>It worked before, it'll work again.

513
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,460
<22-15,BECKETT>太平间只是一个房间而已
<22-15,BECKETT>The morgue was one room.

514
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:40,120
<22-15,BECKETT>你现在说的可是整体70年代化改造
<22-15,BECKETT>You're talking about an entire '70s makeover.

515
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,240
<22-15,BECKETT>这可是个大工程
<22-15,BECKETT>That is a massive undertaking.

516
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:46,550
<22-16,CASTLE>这也是我为什么找了个专家  算是吧
<22-16,CASTLE>Which is why I've called a specialist...of sorts.

517
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:47,840
<22-17,BECKETT>-不会吧  -正是
<22-17,BECKETT>- No. - Yes.

518
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:50,530
<22-18,CASTLE>我母亲会帮我们协调...
<22-18,CASTLE>My mother is gonna come help us coordinate --

519
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:52,090
<22-19,BECKETT>你这么做是为了你母亲
<22-19,BECKETT>You're doing this for your mother?

520
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:53,790
<22-20,CASTLE>不  当然不是了
<22-20,CASTLE>No! Of course not.

521
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,230
<22-20,CASTLE>有一点吧  是的
<22-20,CASTLE>A little bit. Yes.

522
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:57,340
<22-20,CASTLE>我们的确说过要给她点事做的
<22-20,CASTLE>Well, we did say we'd give her a project.

523
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,760
<22-21,BECKETT>是啊  和我们婚礼有关的
<22-21,BECKETT>Yeah, for our wedding!

524
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,090
<22-21,BECKETT>而不是我的警局
<22-21,BECKETT>Not for my precinct!

525
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,210
<22-22,CASTLE>面对现实吧
<22-22,CASTLE>Let's face it.

526
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:04,390
<22-22,CASTLE>我们不能让那个女人再插手我们的婚礼了
<22-22,CASTLE>We cannot let that woman anywhere near our wedding.

527
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:07,810
<22-22,CASTLE>但是  她会喜欢这差事的
<22-22,CASTLE>But she will love this,

528
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:09,230
<22-22,CASTLE>我们也会因此解决
<22-22,CASTLE>and then we get to solve

529
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:12,100
<22-22,CASTLE>迪斯科年代的最大迷案
<22-22,CASTLE>the greatest mystery of the disco era,

530
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:14,590
<22-22,CASTLE>除了迪斯科流行的原因
<22-22,CASTLE>besides the popularity of disco itself.

531
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:15,490
<22-22,CASTLE>双赢呢
<22-22,CASTLE>It's a win-win.

532
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:16,540
<22-23,BECKETT>我很怀疑
<22-23,BECKETT>I highly doubt that.

533
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:19,350
<22-23,BECKETT>但我也想不出更好的办法了
<22-23,BECKETT>But I don't see a better option.

534
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,000
<22-24,CASTLE>你做了正确的选择
<22-24,CASTLE>You are so doing the right thing,

535
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,120
<22-24,CASTLE>相信我  你会感谢我的
<22-24,CASTLE>and trust me, you will thank me.

536
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:27,100
<22-24,CASTLE>好好看一眼四周吧
<22-24,CASTLE>Now, take a good look around...

537
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,970
<22-24,CASTLE>做一个深情的告别
<22-24,CASTLE>Bid a fond farewell,

538
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:32,950
<22-24,CASTLE>因为等到了明天  这里就是70年代了
<22-24,CASTLE>because by tomorrow, it'll be the '70s.

539
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:38,630
<23-1,CASTLE>怎么要这么久
<23-1,CASTLE>Hey, what is taking so long down there?

540
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:39,820
<23-1,CASTLE>哈罗德准备好出发了
<23-1,CASTLE>Harold is ready to go,

541
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:40,890
<23-1,CASTLE>我快没借口拖住他了
<23-1,CASTLE>and I'm running out of excuses.

542
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:42,660
<23-2,BECKETT>这里简直一团糟
<23-2,BECKETT>This is a total fiasco.

543
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,550
<23-3,CASTLE>你是说我老妈吗
<23-3,CASTLE>A fiasco named Martha Rodgers?

544
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:46,540
<23-4,BECKETT>她把这事弄得声势浩大
<23-4,BECKETT>She's turned this into a huge production.

545
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,170
<23-4,BECKETT>她甚至叫了演员过来
<23-4,BECKETT>She's even brought in actors.

546
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:48,960
<23-5,CASTLE>什么
<23-5,CASTLE>She what?!

547
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:51,710
<23-5,CASTLE>你能  你能叫她听电话吗
<23-5,CASTLE>Would -- would you put her on, please?

548
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,730
<23-6,BECKETT>好  玛莎
<23-6,BECKETT>Yeah. Uh, Martha?

549
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,460
<23-6,BECKETT>卡塞尔的电话
<23-6,BECKETT>Hey. Castle.

550
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,490
<23-7,MARTHA>-理查德  -是的
<23-7,MARTHA>- Richard? - Yeah.

551
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:58,990
<23-9,MARTHA>喂  亲爱的
<23-9,MARTHA>Hi, darling.

552
00:21:59,060 --> 00:21:59,890
<23-10,CASTLE>叫演员做什么  老妈
<23-10,CASTLE>Actors, mother?

553
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:01,900
<23-11,MARTHA>考虑到你那里的人没什么表演天赋
<23-11,MARTHA>In light of the abysmal talent pool you have here,

554
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,480
<23-11,MARTHA>所以我雇了一些演员
<23-11,MARTHA>yes, I've hired a few actors.

555
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,770
<23-11,MARTHA>除此之外
<23-11,MARTHA>And not only that,

556
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:06,490
<23-11,MARTHA>我还写了一些台词
<23-11,MARTHA>I have written these scripts

557
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,780
<23-11,MARTHA>这样大家就知道他们在演什么角色了
<23-11,MARTHA>so that everybody knows exactly what they're playing.

558
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,360
<23-12,CASTLE>我们不需要台词
<23-12,CASTLE>We don't need scripts.

559
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,610
<23-12,CASTLE>也不需要找人来扮演警察
<23-12,CASTLE>And we don't need actors to play cops.

560
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:13,910
<23-12,CASTLE>我们自己就是警察
<23-12,CASTLE>We have actual cops!

561
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:15,970
<23-13,MARTHA>你这么说真是无知
<23-13,MARTHA>That is such an ignorant thing to say

562
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:18,310
<23-13,MARTHA>简直就是对演艺事业的侮辱
<23-13,MARTHA>and an insult to the craft of acting.

563
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:22,710
<23-14,CASTLE>老妈  我们只要带哈罗德穿过警局
<23-14,CASTLE>Mother, all we need is to walk Harold through the precinct

564
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:24,080
<23-14,CASTLE>进入审讯室就行
<23-14,CASTLE>and into interrogation.

565
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,940
<23-15,MARTHA>理查德  我只想给你们做出真实的体验
<23-15,MARTHA>Richard, I am trying to create an authentic experience here

566
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,740
<23-15,MARTHA>这样你俩就能专心破案了
<23-15,MARTHA>so that the two of you can crack this case.

567
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,130
<23-15,MARTHA>这有什么错吗
<23-15,MARTHA>Now, is that so wrong?

568
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:32,730
<23-16,HAROLD>好了  队长  我们出发吧
<23-16,HAROLD>Okay, captain, let's get this show on the road.

569
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,150
<23-17,CASTLE>你听到了吗  老妈
<23-17,CASTLE>Did you hear that, mother?

570
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:36,750
<23-18,MARTHA>音乐起
<23-18,MARTHA>Music to my ears.

571
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:40,710
<23-18,MARTHA>大伙儿听好了  各就各位
<23-18,MARTHA>All right, everyone! Places, please!

572
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:04,760
<24-1,CASTLE>第十二分局  出发吧
<24-1,CASTLE>12th precinct. Let's boogie.

573
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,980
<24-2,HAROLD>快出发吧  等不及了
<24-2,HAROLD>Come on. Let's go already.

574
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:26,550
<24-2,HAROLD>太好了  这和我想的一模一样
<24-2,HAROLD>Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. This is more like it.

575
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:29,250
<24-2,HAROLD>我们的小美女来了
<24-2,HAROLD>Ah, there's the little lady.

576
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:30,610
<25-1,HAROLD>靓妹  你看起来...
<25-1,HAROLD>Hey, sweet cheeks, you look --

577
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:31,930
<25-2,BECKETT>少废话  往前走
<25-2,BECKETT>Stop talking, start walking.

578
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,270
<25-2,BECKETT>卡塞尔

<30-5,BECKETT>这都过去三十多年了
<30-5,BECKETT>That was over 30 years ago.

693
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:12,450
<30-5,BECKETT>那地方没准都拆掉了
<30-5,BECKETT>That place probably doesn't even exist anymore.

694
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:14,630
<30-6,RYAN>尽管那地方改建过不少次
<30-6,RYAN>Actually, it's been through a lot of incarnations,

695
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:17,250
<30-6,RYAN>但你猜怎么着  又改回70年代的俱乐部了
<30-6,RYAN>but guess what -- it's back to being a '70s club again.

696
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,110
<30-7,CASTLE>没准管用呢
<30-7,CASTLE>This could work.

697
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,910
<30-8,BECKETT>先是太平间
<30-8,BECKETT>First the morgue,

698
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:22,450
<30-8,BECKETT>紧接着是整个分局
<30-8,BECKETT>then the precinct,

699
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:24,760
<30-8,BECKETT>现在你们又想带他去怀旧夜店
<30-8,BECKETT>and now you guys want to take him to a club?

700
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,530
<30-8,BECKETT>不行  绝对不行  就此打住
<30-8,BECKETT>No. No. This has to stop.

701
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:30,350
<30-9,CASTLE>我们费了这么大劲  眼看就成了
<30-9,CASTLE>After everything we've already do-- unh-unh. We're too close.

702
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:32,680
<30-9,CASTLE>现在停手的话  我们就白费力气了
<30-9,CASTLE>We stop now, we walk away with nothing.

703
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:36,620
<30-11,GATES>贝克特探长  这是作什么妖呢
<30-11,GATES>Detective Beckett! What the hell is going on here?!

704
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:39,110
<30-12,BECKETT>带他去名流  快走
<30-12,BECKETT>Take him to Glitterati. Go! Go!

705
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:44,340
<31-1,BECKETT>你是不是说过我会感谢你
<31-1,BECKETT>Didn't you say I'd be thanking you?

706
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:46,350
<31-2,CASTLE>大概没到时候吧  盖茨警监
<31-2,CASTLE>Maybe just not right away. Captain Gates.

707
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:48,160
<31-2,CASTLE>我还以为你去参加反恐研讨...
<31-2,CASTLE>I thought you were at a, uh, terrorism sem--

708
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,490
<31-3,GATES>因为有炸弹威胁就取消了
<31-3,GATES>It was cancelled due to a bomb threat.

709
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:52,070
<31-4,CASTLE>真是太讽刺
<31-4,CASTLE>Which is ironic.

710
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:54,510
<31-5,GATES>卡塞尔先生  你脑子出了什么毛病
<31-5,GATES>Mr. Castle, what on earth possessed you

711
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:57,590
<31-5,GATES>想把我的分局变成老侦探剧片场
<31-5,GATES>to turn my precinct into the set of "Kojak"?!

712
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:02,680
<31-5,GATES>对了  我是不是该称呼您  卡塞尔队长
<31-5,GATES>Oh, or should I address you as...Captain Castle?

713
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:05,700
<31-6,CASTLE>那可不是我的主意
<31-6,CASTLE>Okay, that was so not my idea.

714
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,190
<31-7,GATES>是吗  那其他都是你的主意吧
<31-7,GATES>Oh, but the rest of this was?

715
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:08,860
<31-8,BECKETT>长官  公平地讲
<31-8,BECKETT>Sir. In fairness --

716
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,750
<31-9,GATES>还有你  贝克特探长
<31-9,GATES>And you, Detective Beckett,

717
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:13,320
<31-9,GATES>你知道这案子关注度有多高
<31-9,GATES>you know what a high-profile case this is.

718
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,910
<31-9,GATES>你怎么能让他这么胡来
<31-9,GATES>How could you allow this circus?

719
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:17,890
<31-10,BECKETT>长官  考虑到他对70年代的痴迷
<31-10,BECKETT>Sir, given his fixation with the '70s,

720
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:19,740
<31-10,BECKETT>我们以为这样有可能使哈罗德·利昂
<31-10,BECKETT>we figured that this would be an opportunity

721
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:22,640
<31-10,BECKETT>把他知道的关于文森特·比安奇谋杀案的一切
<31-10,BECKETT>to let Harold Leone open up about his knowledge

722
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:24,540
<31-10,BECKETT>都告诉我们
<31-10,BECKETT>on Vincent Bianchi's murder.

723
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:25,940
<31-11,GATES>他说了吗
<31-11,GATES>And did he?

724
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:27,530
<31-11,GATES>这个
<31-11,GATES>Well...

725
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,990
<31-12,CASTLE>还没说  但是
<31-12,CASTLE>no, but --

726
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:33,390
<31-13,GATES>这么说来  你们搞了这么一出闹剧
<31-13,GATES>So, all this mess, this ridiculous display...

727
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:34,990
<31-13,GATES>却一点成果都没有
<31-13,GATES>and you have nothing to show for it?

728
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:35,970
<31-14,BECKETT>我们有成果
<31-14,BECKETT>Actually, sir, we do.

729
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:38,600
<31-14,BECKETT>太平间枪案的通缉嫌犯有消息了
<31-14,BECKETT>A.P.B. just snagged our suspect from the morgue shooting.

730
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,230
<31-14,BECKETT>他在泽西高速的一处收费站被截
<31-14,BECKETT>He stopped at a tollbooth on the Jersey Turnpike.

731
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:42,320
<31-14,BECKETT>他们正把他抓捕归案
<31-14,BECKETT>They're bringing him in now.

732
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,650
<31-15,GATES>正经的刑侦办法才能取得突破
<31-15,GATES>A breakthrough achieved by proper police work,

733
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:47,000
<31-15,GATES>不是搞什么时空穿越
<31-15,GATES>not by pretending it's the '70s!

734
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:51,030
<31-15,GATES>趁我现在还没想好怎么罚你们
<31-15,GATES>Until I can decide what disciplinary action to take,

735
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:52,780
<31-15,GATES>你俩赶紧从我眼前消失
<31-15,GATES>I want the both of you out of my sight,

736
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:53,790
<31-15,GATES>尤其是你
<31-15,GATES>especially you.

737
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:55,770
<31-15,GATES>我叫埃斯波西托和莱恩来
<31-15,GATES>I'm bringing in Esposito and Ryan.

738
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:59,380
<31-16,BECKETT>长官  他俩都不在
<31-16,BECKETT>Sir... they're not here.

739
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,690
<31-17,CASTLE>他们带着哈罗德去场子了
<31-17,CASTLE>They took Harold to a -- a disco.

740
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:17,770
<32-1,RYAN>我跟你说  就这行头  这座驾
<32-1,RYAN>I tell you, these clothes, that car,

741
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,240
<32-1,RYAN>我感觉势不可挡
<32-1,RYAN>I feel invincible, man.

742
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:21,990
<32-1,RYAN>就像雷·普莱斯一样
<32-1,RYAN>Like Ray Price.

743
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:24,930
<32-1,RYAN>酷的掉渣  还顶着70年代的名字
<32-1,RYAN>Kicking ass and taking names '70s style.

744
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:26,030
<32-1,RYAN>现在我懂了
<32-1,RYAN>I get it now, baby.

745
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,680
<32-2,ESPOSITO>你懂了就好
<32-2,ESPOSITO>Yeah, good for you.

746
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:35,430
<33-2,HAROLD>这简直太棒了
<33-2,HAROLD>Wow, this is out of sight!

747
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,700
<33-3,RYAN>你想起来什么没  哈罗德
<33-3,RYAN>Anything coming back to you there, Harold? Huh?

748
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:44,130
<33-4,ESPOSITO>关于名流和文森谋杀案的关系
<33-4,ESPOSITO>Yeah, about how Glitterati connects back to Vince.

749
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:47,190
<33-5,HAROLD>没有  还没有  再等等
<33-5,HAROLD>Uh, no, no. No, not yet. Not yet.

750
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:48,490
<33-5,HAROLD>给我点时间  给我...
<33-5,HAROLD>Give me a minute. Give me a...

751
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:49,380
<33-5,HAROLD>你好啊
<33-5,HAROLD>Hey.

752
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,840
<33-5,HAROLD>宝贝  宝贝
<33-5,HAROLD>Oh, baby, baby!

753
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,340
<33-5,HAROLD>怎么样  美女
<33-5,HAROLD>How you doing, hot stuff?

754
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:56,240
<33-5,HAROLD>裙子不错  能脱下来吗
<33-5,HAROLD>That's a nice dress. Can I talk you out of it?

755
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,810
<34-1,ROBERT DECKER>你们是在搞化装舞会吗
<34-1,ROBERT DECKER>You throwing a costume party out there?

756
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:04,950
<34-2,BECKETT>这是你试图在太平间
<34-2,BECKETT>Well, here's you in your costume

757
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:07,290
<34-2,BECKETT>杀死哈罗德·利昂的装束
<34-2,BECKETT>after you tried to kill Harold Leone at the morgue.

758
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:09,610
<34-3,DECKER>不过是一个人在路上走
<34-3,DECKER>That's a guy walking down the street.

759
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:10,360
<34-3,DECKER>我只看到了这个
<34-3,DECKER>That's all I see.

760
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,610
<34-4,BECKETT>没错  但你看来常去案发现场
<34-4,BECKETT>Yeah, well, you seem to be walking down a lot of streets

761
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,880
<34-4,BECKETT>周边散步  让我们来看看
<34-4,BECKETT>where homicides happen. Let's see.

762
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:15,930
<34-4,BECKETT>罗伯特·德克尔
<34-4,BECKETT>Robert Decker,

763
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:18,500
<34-4,BECKETT>斗殴  杀人
<34-4,BECKETT>assault convictions, manslaughter,

764
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:22,430
<34-4,BECKETT>六起买凶杀人案的嫌疑犯
<34-4,BECKETT>a person of interest in six contract killings.

765
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,780
<35-1,DECKER>你手里没有任何证据
<35-1,DECKER>Look, you got no proof.

766
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,750
<35-1,DECKER>没有人能证明我在那里
<35-1,DECKER>No witnesses can say I was there.

767
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,280
<35-1,DECKER>包括你
<35-1,DECKER>Including you.

768
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:29,750
<35-1,DECKER>我们在你的车门里
<35-1,DECKER>We found your gun

769
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,180
<35-2,BECKETT>找到了藏着的枪
<35-2,BECKETT>hidden in the door panel of your car.

770
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,500
<35-2,BECKETT>相信里面的子弹会和太平间枪案的一样
<35-2,BECKETT>It's gonna match the bullets fired in the Morgue.

771
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,000
<35-2,BECKETT>我抓到你了
<35-2,BECKETT>I've got you.

772
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,730
<35-2,BECKETT>现在  为什么不告诉我是谁雇了你
<35-2,BECKETT>Now, why don't you tell me who hired you?

773
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:39,590
<35-2,BECKETT>我会在检察官前说你几句好话
<35-2,BECKETT>I'll put in a good word with the D.A.

774
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:42,250
<35-2,BECKETT>招了吧  谁雇的你
<35-2,BECKETT>Come on. Who hired you?

775
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,280
<35-2,BECKETT>是迈克尔·卡卡诺吗
<35-2,BECKETT>Was it Michael Carcano?

776
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:45,800
<35-3,DECKER>无可奉告
<35-3,DECKER>I got nothing to say.

777
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:50,290
<35-3,DECKER>你多大  六十了吧
<35-3,DECKER>What are you, like 60 years old?

778
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:53,350
<36-1,BECKETT>就算判个十年  对你来说也是终身监禁
<36-1,BECKETT>So, even another 10 years is gonna be life in prison for you.

779
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:56,220
<36-2,DECKER>我在牢里的朋友
<36-2,DECKER>I got more friends on the inside

780
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,560
<36-2,DECKER>可比在牢外的多
<36-2,DECKER>than the outside at this point.

781
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,890
<36-3,DECKER>你们这儿的人真是配合默契啊
<36-3,DECKER>You guys run a real tight ship here.

782
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:10,200
<36-3,DECKER>卡塞尔  搞什么
<36-3,DECKER>Castle... what the hell?

783
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,250
<37-1,BECKETT>我有发现
<37-1,BECKETT>I got something.

784
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:14,010
<37-2,CASTLE>我在找70年代在名流拍摄的老照片
<37-2,CASTLE>I was looking at old photos taken at Glitterati in the '70s.

785
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:15,580
<37-2,CASTLE>结果发现了三张文森
<37-2,CASTLE>I found three of Vince

786
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:17,430
<37-2,CASTLE>在舞池里尽情摇摆的照片
<37-2,CASTLE>on the dance floor boogying his heart out.

787
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:19,430
<37-3,BECKETT>好吧  文森去夜店玩了  这有什么稀奇
<37-3,BECKETT>Okay, so Vince went to the club. How is that news?

788
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:23,260
<37-4,CASTLE>因为这些照片是在不同场合拍的
<37-4,CASTLE>Because these pictures are taken on three different occasions,

789
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:25,860
<37-4,CASTLE>而他总是穿着一样的衣服
<37-4,CASTLE>and he's always wearing the same thing.

790
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:27,180
<37-5,BECKETT>灰蓝色西装
<37-5,BECKETT>The powder-blue suit.

791
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,870
<37-6,CASTLE>这是个特定的迪斯科装束
<37-6,CASTLE>It's a designated disco outfit.

792
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:30,890
<37-7,BECKETT>文森一定在被杀当晚去了名流
<37-7,BECKETT>Vince must've gone to Glitterati the night that he was killed.

793
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:32,660
<37-8,CASTLE>或许他就在那里被杀的
<37-8,CASTLE>It might even be where he was killed,

794
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:33,950
<37-8,CASTLE>看看这家俱乐部的老板是谁
<37-8,CASTLE>because look who owns the club.

795
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:44,900
<38-1,ESPOSITO>请等一下  贝克特
<38-1,ESPOSITO>Excuse me one second. Beckett.

796
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,720
<38-2,BECKETT>哈罗德在哪儿
<38-2,BECKETT>Where's Harold?

797
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,170
<38-3,ESPOSITO>-他刚去上厕所了  -找到他
<38-3,ESPOSITO>- He just took off for a second to take a leak.  - Find him.

798
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:51,270
<38-4,BECKETT>弗兰克·鲁索以前是这家俱乐部的老板  现在也是
<38-4,BECKETT>Frank Russo owned the club back then, and he owns it now.

799
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:52,220
<38-5,ESPOSITO>明白
<38-5,ESPOSITO>Got it.

800
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:02,990
<39-1,SECURITY GUARD>抱歉  哥们
<39-1,SECURITY GUARD>Hey, sorry, buddy.

801
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:04,660
<39-1,SECURITY GUARD>你要是想见鲁索先生  得先预约才行
<39-1,SECURITY GUARD>You want to see Mr. Russo, you need to make an appointment.

802
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,290
<39-2,HAROLD>没关系
<39-2,HAROLD>Oh, no sweat.

803
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:14,630
<39-3,FRANK>是谁...  哈罗德
<39-3,FRANK>Who the -- Harol-- Harold?

804
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:16,070
<39-4,HAROLD>承认你杀了文森吧
<39-4,HAROLD>Admit you killed Vince.

805
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:19,150
<39-4,HAROLD>乖乖承认吧  我让你死个痛快
<39-4,HAROLD>Just admit it to me, and you won't suffer.

806
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:20,370
<39-5,ESPOSITO>哈罗德
<39-5,ESPOSITO>Harold!

807
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,550
<39-6,RYAN>放下武器  哈罗德
<39-6,RYAN>Drop the weapon, Harold!

808
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,680
<39-7,ESPOSITO>马上发现
<39-7,ESPOSITO>Drop it now!

809
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,090
<40-1,HAROLD>我的东西在哪儿
<40-1,HAROLD>Where is my stuff?

810
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:30,050
<40-1,HAROLD>警官把我口袋都掏空了
<40-1,HAROLD>The booking officer made me empty my pockets.

811
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:32,440
<40-2,BECKETT>你现在的问题要比你的个人物品严重的多  哈罗德
<40-2,BECKETT>You have bigger problems than your personal effects, Harold,

812
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:35,490
<40-2,BECKETT>比如非法袭击  比如欺骗警察
<40-2,BECKETT>Like assault charges, like lying to the police.

813
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:37,260
<40-2,BECKETT>告诉我
<40-2,BECKETT>Tell me something.

814
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:41,290
<40-5,HAROLD>现在是哪一年
<40-5,HAROLD>What year is it?

815
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:43,700
<40-6,BECKETT>别...
<40-6,BECKETT>Don't --

816
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,340
<40-4,BECKETT>别装了  哈罗德
<40-4,BECKETT>Drop the act, Harold.

817
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:46,950
<40-4,BECKETT>告诉我今年是哪一年
<40-4,BECKETT>Tell me what year it is.

818
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:49,080
<40-5,HAROLD>-我知道你很清楚  -求你了  别问了
<40-5,HAROLD>- I know that you know. - Please stop. Please.

819
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,180
<40-6,BECKETT>到底是哪一年  哈罗德
<40-6,BECKETT>What year is it, Harold?

820
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:52,820
<40-7,HAROLD>我希望现在就是那一年  可以吗
<40-7,HAROLD>It is the year I need it to be, okay?

821
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:55,220
<40-7,HAROLD>那时候文森还活着  一切都很美好
<40-7,HAROLD>When Vince was alive and things were good.

822
00:33:56,110 --> 00:34:01,000
<40-8,CASTLE>哈罗德  你为什么认为是弗兰克·鲁索杀了文森
<40-8,CASTLE>Harold, what makes you think Frank Russo killed Vince?

823
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:05,460
<40-9,HAROLD>文森只有去名流才穿那件蓝西装
<40-9,HAROLD>Vince only ever wore that blue suit to Glitterati.

824
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:08,950
<40-9,HAROLD>当你们说他死时穿着那件  我就知道了
<40-9,HAROLD>When you two said that's what he had on, I knew.

825
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,800
<40-10,BECKETT>关于那晚发生的事  你还记得多少
<40-10,BECKETT>What else do you remember about what happened that night?

826
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:14,230
<40-11,HAROLD>在我们去吃晚饭之前
<40-11,HAROLD>Before we went to dinner,

827
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,270
<40-11,HAROLD>文森跟我说晚点要见我
<40-11,HAROLD>Vince told me that he needed to meet up with me later,

828
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:19,440
<40-11,HAROLD>他有很重要的事情要说
<40-11,HAROLD>that he had something important to tell me.

829
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:21,750
<40-11,HAROLD>然后他迟迟没有露面  我很担心
<40-11,HAROLD>And then when he didn't show up, I got worried.

830
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:25,440
<40-11,HAROLD>我开着车到处去找
<40-11,HAROLD>I...I was driving all over the place looking for him,

831
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,390
<40-11,HAROLD>我去了他所有经常去的地方  我甚至去了名流
<40-11,HAROLD>I-I hit all of his old haunts. I even went to Glitterati.

832
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:30,650
<40-11,HAROLD>但门上贴了个告示
<40-11,HAROLD>But there was a sign on the door

833
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:34,330
<40-11,HAROLD>写着因私事关闭
<40-11,HAROLD>that said it was closed for a private event.

834
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:36,420
<40-12,BECKETT>而当你听说文森穿着那件西装
<40-12,BECKETT>And when you heard Vince had that suit on?

835
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:39,990
<40-13,HAROLD>我想那私事就是弗兰克杀害了他
<40-13,HAROLD>I figured the private event was Frank killing him.

836
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:43,450
<40-13,HAROLD>但我知道我不能直接去找他算账
<40-13,HAROLD>But I knew I couldn't just go straight at Frank,

837
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:44,870
<40-13,HAROLD>特别是在他要干掉我之后
<40-13,HAROLD>not after he tried to whack me.

838
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:46,970
<40-14,BECKETT>你就一直耍我们
<40-14,BECKETT>You were playing us the whole time.

839
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,870
<40-15,HAROLD>不  不  一开始并没有
<40-15,HAROLD>No, no. Not at the beginning.

840
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:53,870
<40-15,HAROLD>但那天有人朝我开枪  我的记忆就回来了
<40-15,HAROLD>But when I got shot at... that's when things got real.

841
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:58,000
<40-15,HAROLD>就像是  突然明白了过来
<40-15,HAROLD>It was like, uh -- like a bubble popped inside me.

842
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:00,220
<40-16,CASTLE>你让我们带你去警局
<40-16,CASTLE>You asked us to bring you to the precinct

843
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:02,940
<40-16,CASTLE>就是想知道弗兰克现在长什么样子
<40-16,CASTLE>hoping you could see what Frank looks like now,

844
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:06,030
<40-16,CASTLE>希望我们能直接把你送到他门前
<40-16,CASTLE>hoping we would lead you right to his doorstep.

845
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:09,280
<40-17,HAROLD>弗兰克要为他对文森做的事付出代价
<40-17,HAROLD>Frank needed to pay for what he did to Vince.

846
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:13,070
<41-1,FRANK>我没有想要干掉任何人  包括文森和哈罗德
<41-1,FRANK>I didn't try to whack anybody -- Not Vince, Not Harold, either.

847
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,430
<41-2,ESPOSITO>那是谁干的  弗兰克
<41-2,ESPOSITO>Then who did, Frank?

848
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:15,630
<41-3,FRANK>我怎么知道
<41-3,FRANK>How the hell would I know?

849
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,820
<41-3,FRANK>但如果哈罗德说是我杀的文森
<41-3,FRANK>But if Harold is saying that I took out Vince,

850
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,130
<41-3,FRANK>那真是大错特错
<41-3,FRANK>he is way off base.

851
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,690
<41-4,ESPOSITO>文森那晚去了名流
<41-4,ESPOSITO>Well, Vince went to Glitterati that night,

852
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:23,950
<41-4,ESPOSITO>而你却正好因为私事停业
<41-4,ESPOSITO>yet you had it closed for an event.

853
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:24,580
<41-5,RYAN>这是你的俱乐部  弗兰克
<41-5,RYAN>It's your club, Frank.

854
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,760
<41-5,RYAN>你是要告诉我
<41-5,RYAN>Are you trying to tell us that

855
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,720
<41-5,RYAN>你不知道你自己的俱乐部里发生了什么吗
<41-5,RYAN>you don't know what's going on inside your own club?

856
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,830
<41-6,ESPOSITO>那晚到底发生了什么
<41-6,ESPOSITO>What happened that night?

857
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:34,600
<42-1,FRANK>我从未跟别人说过这件事
<42-1,FRANK>What I'm about to tell you, I never told anybody.

858
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,360
<42-1,FRANK>是文森
<42-1,FRANK>It was Vince.

859
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:38,320
<42-1,FRANK>文森才是那晚包下了俱乐部的人
<42-1,FRANK>Vince booked the club that night.

860
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:41,210
<42-2,RYAN>文森有私事吗
<42-2,RYAN>Vince had the private event?

861
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,570
<42-3,FRANK>他在晚饭时跟我提出来
<42-3,FRANK>He brought it up to me over dinner,

862
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:44,530
<42-3,FRANK>说要把俱乐部整晚都包下来
<42-3,FRANK>said he wanted the club to himself that night.

863
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:47,420
<42-3,FRANK>他是老大  我能拒绝吗
<42-3,FRANK>I mean, he was the boss. What was I gonna do, say no?

864
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:51,490
<42-3,FRANK>文森去了我的俱乐部  结果失踪了
<42-3,FRANK>Vince goes to my club, ends up missing.

865
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:54,160
<42-3,FRANK>如果人们知道的话  他们就会以为是我杀了他的
<42-3,FRANK>If people knew that, they would've thought I killed him,

866
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,310
<42-3,FRANK>所以我从没说过这件事
<42-3,FRANK>So I kept my mouth shut about it.

867
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:58,590
<42-4,RYAN>文森为什么要包下俱乐部
<42-4,RYAN>Why would Vince want the club?

868
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:01,120
<42-4,RYAN>他一直在说要收心  要结婚
<42-4,RYAN>He had been talking about settling down, getting married.

869
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,720
<43-1,FRANK>我猜他是要跟某个姑娘求婚
<43-1,FRANK>I figured he was proposing to some girl.

870
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:05,230
<43-1,FRANK>再加上  第二天早上我去开门的时候
<43-1,FRANK>Plus, when I opened up the next morning,

871
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:07,770
<43-1,FRANK>《最后一舞》的碟就放在转盘上
<43-1,FRANK>"Last dance" was on the turntable.

872
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:10,750
<43-1,FRANK>那时候最浪漫的歌曲
<43-1,FRANK>A romantic favorite back then.

873
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:12,170
<44-1,RYAN>哪个姑娘
<44-1,RYAN>So, what girl?

874
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:14,500
<44-1,RYAN>他从没提起过  我也没问
<44-1,RYAN>He didn't talk about her, and I didn't ask.

875
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:16,840
<44-2,FRANK>但我知道有这么个人对他很重要
<44-2,FRANK>But I knew he had someone special in his life.

876
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:18,240
<44-3,CASTLE>那个神秘的女人是谁
<44-3,CASTLE>Who's this mystery woman?

877
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:21,250
<44-3,CASTLE>是她引诱文森到俱乐部杀了他
<44-3,CASTLE>Did she lure Vince to the club to be assassinated,

878
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:25,360
<44-3,CASTLE>还是他的浪漫计划出了大纰漏
<44-3,CASTLE>or...some romantic plan of his go horribly awry?

879
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,090
<44-4,BECKETT>可能就是这么一回事
<44-4,BECKETT>That may be exactly what happened.

880
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:30,010
<44-4,BECKETT>我翻看了哈罗德的个人物品
<44-4,BECKETT>I went through Harold's personal effects.

881
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:31,410
<44-4,BECKETT>看我找到了什么
<44-4,BECKETT>Look at what I found.

882
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,440
<45-1,BECKETT>你担心的是这个吗  哈罗德
<45-1,BECKETT>Was this the item that you were so worried about, Harold?

883
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:53,880
<45-2,CASTLE>康尼岛的  和文森的一模一样
<45-2,CASTLE>It's from Coney Island. Just like Vince's.

884
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:57,570
<45-2,CASTLE>连敲在后面的日期也一样
<45-2,CASTLE>Even has the same date stamped on it.

885
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:01,330
<45-3,BECKETT>你也和文森一样  随身携带
<45-3,BECKETT>You carried it with you just like Vince did.

886
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:05,070
<45-3,BECKETT>你在太平间里一看到它就红了眼睛
<45-3,BECKETT>Seeing it at the morgue brought you to tears.

887
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:07,390
<45-4,CASTLE>你和文森是爱人
<45-4,CASTLE>You and Vince were in love.

888
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:11,840
<45-4,CASTLE>没错
<45-4,CASTLE>Yes.

889
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:14,120
<45-5,HAROLD>我们是爱人
<45-5,HAROLD>We were.

890
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:17,260
<45-5,HAROLD>我们也尝试过不去爱  可...
<45-5,HAROLD>We tried not to be, but...

891
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:20,880
<45-6,CASTLE>而你就要失去他了
<45-6,CASTLE>And you were going to lose him.

892
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:24,220
<45-7,HAROLD>等等
<45-7,HAROLD>Wait.

893
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:28,050
<45-7,HAROLD>你不会以为是我杀了文森吧
<45-7,HAROLD>You can't be thinking that I killed Vince.

894
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:30,440
<45-8,BECKETT>没错  我们相信他是去名流
<45-8,BECKETT>Yeah, we believe that he went to Glitterati

895
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,750
<45-8,BECKETT>求婚的
<45-8,BECKETT>to propose marriage.

896
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:33,630
<45-8,BECKETT>他为了一个女人要离开你
<45-8,BECKETT>He was leaving you for a woman.

897
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,020
<45-8,BECKETT>那是当然
<45-8,BECKETT>Of course he was.

898
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:38,840
<45-9,HAROLD>叫他结婚的人是我
<45-9,HAROLD>I was the one who told him he had to get married.

899
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,850
<45-9,HAROLD>如果有人发现我们的关系  那会毁了他
<45-9,HAROLD>It would ruin him if people found out about us.

900
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:45,900
<45-9,HAROLD>能做他背后的人...
<45-9,HAROLD>Being his number two...

901
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,490
<45-9,HAROLD>我就很满足了
<45-9,HAROLD>was enough for me.

902
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,670
<45-9,HAROLD>哈罗德
<45-9,HAROLD>Harold?

903
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,220
<45-10,BECKETT>如果文森要结婚
<45-10,BECKETT>If Vince was getting married,

904
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,770
<45-10,BECKETT>怎么可能没人知道呢
<45-10,BECKETT>how come no one else knew about it?

905
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,750
<45-11,HAROLD>这是一个秘密
<45-11,HAROLD>It had to be kept hush-hush.

906
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:00,650
<45-11,HAROLD>这不仅仅是一桩婚事
<45-11,HAROLD>You see, this was more than a marriage.

907
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:02,200
<45-11,HAROLD>也是一次合并
<45-11,HAROLD>It was a merger.

908
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,590
<45-11,HAROLD>文森要娶的是迈克尔·卡卡诺的妹妹
<45-11,HAROLD>Vince was gonna marry Michael Carcano's sister

909
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:08,700
<45-11,HAROLD>两家合为一家
<45-11,HAROLD>and unite the two families.

910
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:13,010
<45-11,HAROLD>但他从没告诉过我  他要在那晚求婚
<45-11,HAROLD>But he never told me that he was gonna propose that night.

911
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:17,280
<45-12,CASTLE>迈克尔·卡卡诺的妹妹是谁  她叫什么名字
<45-12,CASTLE>Who is Michael Carcano's sister? What's her name?

912
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:21,150
<46-1,MARIE>弗兰克不在
<46-1,MARIE>Frank's not here.

913
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:23,840
<46-2,BECKETT>没事  其实我们找的不是弗兰克·鲁索夫人
<46-2,BECKETT>Yeah, actually, we're not looking for Frank, Mrs. Russo.

914
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,120
<46-2,BECKETT>我们能进来吗
<46-2,BECKETT>Would you mind if we came in?

915
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:27,430
<46-3,MARIE>长话短说吧
<46-3,MARIE>Let's keep this short.

916
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:29,420
<46-3,MARIE>我的冥想老师就快到了
<46-3,MARIE>My meditation teacher's on her way.

917
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:31,300
<46-4,BECKETT>好吧  你来说说
<46-4,BECKETT>Okay, so then why don't you tell us

918
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:33,840
<46-4,BECKETT>文森消失那晚  名流到底发生了什么
<46-4,BECKETT>what happened at Glitterati the night that Vince vanished?

919
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,780
<46-5,MARIE>-我怎么会知道  -因为你在场
<46-5,MARIE>- How would I know? - Because you were there.

920
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:38,450
<46-7,MARIE>你说什么
<46-7,MARIE>What are you talking about?

921
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,680
<46-8,CASTLE>文森放了那首《最后一舞》
<46-8,CASTLE>Vince had "Last dance" playing.

922
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,600
<46-8,CASTLE>你以为他就要求婚了
<46-8,CASTLE>You thought he was going to propose,

923
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,710
<46-8,CASTLE>为了巩固
<46-8,CASTLE>to cement, as it were,

924
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:47,650
<46-8,CASTLE>你们两家的关系
<46-8,CASTLE>the union between your two families.

925
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:49,310
<46-9,BECKETT>但他却无法向你求婚
<46-9,BECKETT>But he couldn't go through with it.

926
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:50,700
<46-10,CASTLE>你接受不了拒绝
<46-10,CASTLE>You couldn't handle the rejection.

927
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:53,240
<46-10,CASTLE>于是  等他转身  你朝他开了枪
<46-10,CASTLE>So, as he left, you shot him in the back,

928
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,510
<46-10,CASTLE>然后正脸又是一枪
<46-10,CASTLE>then again in the face.

929
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:56,120
<46-10,CASTLE>因为这是个人恩怨
<46-10,CASTLE>You know, because it was personal.

930
00:38:57,170 --> 00:38:59,310
<46-11,MARIE>你们的想法真是天马行空
<46-11,MARIE>You guys have quite the imagination.

931
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:02,630
<46-12,BECKETT>你哥哥知道文森的死会引发黑帮大战
<46-12,BECKETT>Your brother knew that Vince's murder would trigger a mob war,

932
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,290
<46-12,BECKETT>于是他利用混凝土之便
<46-12,BECKETT>So he used his access to concrete

933
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:06,130
<46-12,BECKETT>让文森消失
<46-12,BECKETT>to make Vince disappear.

934
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:08,860
<46-13,CASTLE>之后  你又勾搭上了弗兰克
<46-13,CASTLE>After that, you hitched your wagon to Frank,

935
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:11,340
<46-13,CASTLE>但是他在比安奇家族的地位实在是...
<46-13,CASTLE>but his tenure as head of the Bianchi family was...

936
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:13,330
<46-13,CASTLE>微乎其微
<46-13,CASTLE>disappointingly brief.

937
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,220
<46-14,MARIE>你们什么都证明不了
<46-14,MARIE>You can't prove any of this.

938
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,220
<46-14,MARIE>只不过是个推论  你们可以走了
<46-14,MARIE>All you've got is a story. Now get out.

939
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,710
<46-15,BECKETT>如果只是推论
<46-15,BECKETT>If it is just a story,

940
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:25,930
<46-15,BECKETT>那你也不会雇一个杀手
<46-15,BECKETT>then you wouldn't have hired a hit man.

941
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:29,830
<46-15,BECKETT>罗伯特·德克尔不想死在监狱里
<46-15,BECKETT>Robert Decker decided that he didn't want to die in prison,

942
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:31,150
<46-15,BECKETT>他供出了你
<46-15,BECKETT>so he rolled on you.

943
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:33,340
<46-15,BECKETT>他告诉我们  当你发现哈罗德配合警方后
<46-15,BECKETT>He told us that you paid him to kill Harold

944
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:35,320
<46-15,BECKETT>是你雇他杀了哈罗德
<46-15,BECKETT>when you found out he was talking to the cops.

945
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:36,740
<46-16,CASTLE>而有趣的是
<46-16,CASTLE>And here's the funny part.

946
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:38,840
<46-16,CASTLE>也许对你来说很无趣
<46-16,CASTLE>Well, maybe not so funny to you.

947
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:42,360
<46-16,CASTLE>没有人  包括哈罗德知道你杀了文森
<46-16,CASTLE>Nobody, including Harold, knew you killed Vince.

948
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:44,880
<46-16,CASTLE>如果你不去追杀哈罗德
<46-16,CASTLE>If you had just left Harold alone,

949
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:46,410
<46-16,CASTLE>事情也许就算过去了
<46-16,CASTLE>it would've stayed that way.

950
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,280
<46-16,CASTLE>玛丽亚·鲁索
<46-16,CASTLE>Maria Russo...

951
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:55,840
<46-17,BECKETT>你因涉嫌谋杀被逮捕
<46-17,BECKETT>you are under arrest for conspiracy to commit murder.

952
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:56,890
<46-17,BECKETT>我们走
<46-17,BECKETT>Let's go.

953
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,750
<47-1,HAROLD>真希望文森答应了他们的婚事
<47-1,HAROLD>I wish Vince had just said yes to her.

954
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:10,400
<47-1,HAROLD>这样也许他还活着
<47-1,HAROLD>Maybe then he'd still be alive.

955
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:12,970
<47-2,BECKETT>但至少他遵从了自己的心
<47-2,BECKETT>Well, he had to follow his heart.

956
00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:15,250
<47-2,BECKETT>这也许是他那晚想告诉你的
<47-2,BECKETT>It's probably what he wanted to tell you that night.

957
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:18,140
<47-3,HAROLD>知道他为我付出的真相  真有那么重要吗
<47-3,HAROLD>Isn't that something, knowing he did that for me?

958
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:21,470
<47-4,BECKETT>在21世纪的感觉如何
<47-4,BECKETT>So, how does it feel to be in the 2010s?

959
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:22,910
<47-4,BECKETT>还行吧
<47-4,BECKETT>Eh, it's okay.

960
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:25,200
<47-5,HAROLD>我已经做好准备  告别70年代
<47-5,HAROLD>I'm ready to say goodbye to the '70s,

961
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:26,620
<47-5,HAROLD>告别文森
<47-5,HAROLD>say goodbye to Vince.

962
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:29,160
<47-6,CASTLE>那我们就用70年代的方式来告别吧
<47-6,CASTLE>Well, then let's do it the right way.

963
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:31,510
<47-6,CASTLE>以此纪念随时间逝去的人
<47-6,CASTLE>Honor the times along with the man.

964
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,950
<47-7,BECKETT>卡塞尔  别告诉我你...
<47-7,BECKETT>Castle, tell me you don't mea--

966

<48-1,CASTLE>I had no idea you could disco dance!

967
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:45,590
<48-2,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我隐藏的天赋多了去呢
<48-2,BECKETT>Oh, Castle, I'm a woman of many hidden talents.

<48-3,CASTLE>待我一个一个慢慢发现
<48-3,CASTLE>I look forward to discovering every single one.

<48-6,MARTHA>Doesn't she look stunning in this outfit?
