<2-11,CASTLE>你会后悔没去上法学院吗
<2-11,CASTLE>You ever regret it, not getting your law degree?

28
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:15,140
<2-12,BECKETT>我宁可抓到罪犯  而不是送他们进监狱

00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,220
<3-7,BECKETT>你们要怎么超越

<3-8,RYAN>不管我们做什么  都会震惊四座的
<3-8,RYAN>whatever we do is gonna blow the rest of the field away.

55
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:10,670
<3-9,CASTLE>那是因为我不是警察  不能参加
<3-9,CASTLE>Well, that's only because, not being a cop, I'm ineligible.

56
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:12,220
<3-9,CASTLE>但如果我能和贝克特一起参赛
<3-9,CASTLE>But if Beckett and I were competing,

57
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,320
<3-9,CASTLE>你们就别想连冠了

61
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,280
<3-11,RYAN>没有电话或钱包
<3-11,RYAN>No phone, no wallet.

62
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,290
<3-12,BECKETT>死因
<3-12,BECKETT>Cause?

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,840
<3-13,LANIE PARISH>可能是一截管子或者棒球棒
<3-13,LANIE PARISH>Probably a pipe or a baseball bat.

65
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:29,540
<3-13,LANIE PARISH>从尸斑看  死亡时间
<3-13,LANIE PARISH>Based on lividity, I'd say it happened

66
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,680
<3-13,LANIE PARISH>是午夜12点到凌晨2点间
<3-13,LANIE PARISH>between 12:00 and 2:00 a.m. this morning.

67
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,700
<3-14,CASTLE>有目击者吗
<3-14,CASTLE>Any witnesses?

68
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,100
<3-15,JAVIER ESPOSITO>附近的一名居民凌晨1点左右听到了尖叫
<3-15,JAVIER ESPOSITO>A guy who lives nearby heard screams around 1:00 a.m.

69
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,730
<3-15,JAVIER ESPOSITO>往窗外看  看到一辆车加速离开
<3-15,JAVIER ESPOSITO>He looked out his window. He saw a car speeding away.

70
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,270
<3-16,BECKETT>看到车型了吗

<3-17,ESPOSITO>只能看到尾灯  但他说看着像跑车
<3-17,ESPOSITO>Just taillights. But he said it looked like a sports car.

72
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,200
<3-17,ESPOSITO>我和莱恩会继续找目击证人
<3-17,ESPOSITO>Ryan and I are gonna keep looking for witnesses

73
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,350
<3-17,ESPOSITO>和街头监控录像
<3-17,ESPOSITO>and street-cam footage,

74
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:47,500
<3-17,ESPOSITO>但这里是工业区  监控覆盖不全
<3-17,ESPOSITO>but it's an industrial area, so coverage is spotty.

75
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,800
<3-18,BECKETT>等等  我好像认识他
<3-18,BECKETT>Wait a minute. I think I know this guy.

76
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,900
<3-18,BECKETT>他是人身伤害律师
<3-18,BECKETT>He's that personal-injury attorney on tv

77
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,120
<3-18,BECKETT>深夜电视上有他的广告
<3-18,BECKETT>who has the late-night ads.

<3-20,CASTLE>-斗牛犬  -斗牛犬
<3-20,CASTLE>- The pitbull. - The pitbull.

80
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,110
<3-20,CASTLE>斗牛犬
<3-20,CASTLE>The pitbull?

81
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,380
<3-22,RYAN>是啊  斗牛犬里奇·法科
<3-22,RYAN>Yeah. Richie "The pitbull" Falco.

82
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,810
<3-23,CASTLE>拜托  你肯定见过那个广告
<3-23,CASTLE>Come on, man. You've seen the ads.

83
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,740
<3-23,CASTLE>人头狗身
<3-23,CASTLE>A guy's head on a dog's body.

84
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,220
<3-23,CASTLE>"出事故了吗  抓住法律的尾巴吧"
<3-23,CASTLE>"You been in an accident? Take the law by the tail."

85
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:08,030
<3-24,LANIE>"拿到一个你应得的和解"
<3-24,LANIE>"And get a bite at the settlement you deserve."

86
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,050
<3-25,BECKETT>"我会让法律..."
<3-25,BECKETT>"I'll make the law"...

87
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,280
<3-26,LANIE>唯你是从
<3-26,LANIE>Your bitch!

88
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:13,290
<3-30,ESPOSITO>"斗牛犬还会说西班牙语"
<3-30,ESPOSITO>"El Pitbull tambien halbla Espanol."

89
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:15,120
<3-31,RYAN>为什么只有我没看过这个广告啊
<3-31,RYAN>Why am I the only one who's never seen this commercial?

90
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,180
<3-32,ESPOSITO>因为是深夜广告
<3-32,ESPOSITO>Because it comes on late at night,

91
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,100
<3-32,ESPOSITO>你即使不做兼职
<3-32,ESPOSITO>and when you're not moonlighting,

92
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,250
<3-32,ESPOSITO>你个喝蜜蜂奶的也10点就睡了
<3-32,ESPOSITO>your honey-milk-sipping ass is in bed by 10:00.

93
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,040
<3-33,CASTLE>怎么会有人想杀斗牛犬啊
<3-33,CASTLE>Why would anyone want to kill the pitbull?

94
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,360
<3-34,BECKETT>或许鉴证组能找到凶器
<3-34,BECKETT>Maybe CSU will get lucky and find the murder weapon.

95
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:26,140
<3-34,BECKETT>我们先把尸体运回停尸房
<3-34,BECKETT>Meanwhile, let's get the body to the morgue

96
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,260
<3-34,BECKETT>看看有什么发现
<3-34,BECKETT>and see what it can tell us.

97
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,880
<3-34,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我们去一趟斗牛犬的办公室
<3-34,BECKETT>Castle, you and I should go to pitbull's office,

98
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,990
<3-34,BECKETT>看看能发现什么
<3-34,BECKETT>see what we can find there.

99
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:31,940
<3-22,RYAN>出事故了吗
<3-22,RYAN>Been in an accident?

101
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:32,960
<3-23,CASTLE>抓住法律的尾巴
<3-23,CASTLE>Take the law by the tail

102
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,530
<3-24,LANIE>拿到一个你应得的和解
<3-24,LANIE>and get a bite at the settlement you deserve.

104
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:36,290
<3-24,LANIE>我会为小人物而战
<3-24,LANIE>I'll fight for you, the little guy,

106
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:38,470
<3-25,BECKETT>因为斗牛犬和落水狗要统一阵线
<3-25,BECKETT>because pitbulls and underdogs stick together.

107
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,830
<3-25,BECKETT>记住  我会让法律唯你是从
<3-25,BECKETT>Remember, I'll make the law your bitch!

108
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,140
<3-25,BECKETT>汪汪
<3-25,BECKETT>Ruff!

109
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:43,570
<3-25,BECKETT>汪汪
<3-25,BECKETT>Ruff! Ruff!

110
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,690
<4-1,CASTLE>里奇的委托人虽然不好受
<4-1,CASTLE>Richie's clients may be suffering,

111
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:50,820
<4-1,CASTLE>但他的生意可很火爆
<4-1,CASTLE>but his business sure wasn't.

112
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,120
<4-2,BECKETT>想寻求尽快和解的人
<4-2,BECKETT>Yeah, well, there's always gonna be people

113
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,420
<4-2,BECKETT>从来不缺
<4-2,BECKETT>looking for a quick settlement

114
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,900
<4-2,BECKETT>而里奇这样的底层投机者
<4-2,BECKETT>and plenty of opportunistic bottom-feeders like Richie

115
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,420
<4-2,BECKETT>就会帮他们拿到钱
<4-2,BECKETT>ready to help them cash in.

116
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:59,470
<4-3,CASTLE>一半人肯定都是装的
<4-3,CASTLE>I bet half these people are faking.

117
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,310
<4-3,CASTLE>看到那个人了吗
<4-3,CASTLE>See that guy over there?

118
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:03,730
<4-5,CASTLE>看好了  打扰  先生
<4-5,CASTLE>Watch this. Excuse me, sir?

119
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:05,740
<4-7,CASTLE>能帮我扔掉吗
<4-7,CASTLE>Could you throw this away for me?

120
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,950
<4-8,CASTLE>抱歉  我准头...有点
<4-8,CASTLE>Sorry. My aim is...A little...

121
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,690
<4-8,CASTLE>或许...他可能是真的
<4-8,CASTLE>Maybe... he's probably legit.

122
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:13,700
<4-9,ANNIE KLEIN>抱歉让你们久等  各位
<4-9,ANNIE KLEIN>Sorry for the wait, folks.

123
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,960
<4-9,ANNIE KLEIN>斗牛犬肯定随时就会到的
<4-9,ANNIE KLEIN>I'm sure pitbull will be here any minute.

124
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,980
<5-1,ANNIE>他最近几天的样子
<5-1,ANNIE>The way h-he's been acting the last few days, I...

125
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,800
<5-1,ANNIE>我就知道出事了
<5-1,ANNIE>...I knew something was wrong.

126
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,910
<5-2,BECKETT>他怎么了
<5-2,BECKETT>How was he acting?

127
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,520
<5-3,ANNIE>焦躁  多疑
<5-3,ANNIE>Anxious. Paranoid.

128
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,670
<5-3,ANNIE>他离开办公室前  他会往窗外看
<5-3,ANNIE>Before he'd leave the office, he'd look out the window.

129
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:32,580
<5-3,ANNIE>就好像他觉得有人可能在监视他
<5-3,ANNIE>It's like he thought someone might be watching him.

130
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:33,860
<5-3,ANNIE>昨天早上
<5-3,ANNIE>And yesterday morning,

131
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:36,320
<5-3,ANNIE>他还打电话说他不来了
<5-3,ANNIE>He called to say that he wasn't coming in at all.

132
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,640
<5-4,CASTLE>这不寻常吗
<5-4,CASTLE>Was that unusual?

133
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,530
<5-5,ANNIE>他从不请假
<5-5,ANNIE>He never missed a day

134
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,630
<5-5,ANNIE>我都给他干三年了
<5-5,ANNIE>in the three years I worked for him.

135
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,820
<5-6,BECKETT>你知道是出什么事了吗
<5-6,BECKETT>Do you know what was going on?

136
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:44,730
<5-6,BECKETT>他不肯说
<5-6,BECKETT>He wouldn't talk about it.

137
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:47,510
<5-7,ANNIE>我问他是不是跟我们的案子有关
<5-7,ANNIE>I-I-I asked if it had something to do with one of the cases,

138
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,460
<5-7,ANNIE>他
<5-7,ANNIE>and he...

139
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,730
<5-7,ANNIE>他说不是  还叫我别担心
<5-7,ANNIE>...he said no, and he, uh, told me not to worry...

140
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,200
<5-7,ANNIE>说一切很快就会过去
<5-7,ANNIE>...and that it would all be over soon.

141
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,260
<5-8,CASTLE>他跟谁有矛盾吗
<5-8,CASTLE>Was he having any problems with anyone?

142
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,270
<5-8,CASTLE>客户  或者女友
<5-8,CASTLE>Uh, clients? A girlfriend?

143
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:02,330
<5-8,CASTLE>他没有女友
<5-8,CASTLE>He...didn't have a girlfriend.

144
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,040
<5-9,ANNIE>我一直想...
<5-9,ANNIE>I kept hoping, but...

145
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:10,690
<5-9,ANNIE>我知道你们在想什么
<5-9,ANNIE>Look, I... I know what you guys are thinking.

146
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,310
<5-9,ANNIE>人身伤害律师是人渣  对吧
<5-9,ANNIE>Personal-injury lawyers are gutter rats, right?

147
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:15,140
<5-9,ANNIE>但里奇不一样
<5-9,ANNIE>But Richie was different.

148
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:16,730
<5-9,ANNIE>他是真心的
<5-9,ANNIE>He really cared.

149
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:19,170
<5-9,ANNIE>他认为制定法律是为了保护所有人
<5-9,ANNIE>He thought the law was there to protect everyone

150
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:21,050
<5-9,ANNIE>而不只是保护那些请的起律师的公司
<5-9,ANNIE>And not just corporations who could afford it.

151
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:23,870
<5-9,ANNIE>他的客户也因此爱戴他
<5-9,ANNIE>And his clients, they loved him for it.

152
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,480
<5-10,CASTLE>他的对手呢
<5-10,CASTLE>And his adversaries?

153
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,550
<5-11,ANNIE>当然  被他起诉的人有时候会很愤怒
<5-11,ANNIE>S-sure, people he sued got pissed sometimes.

154
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:30,280
<5-11,ANNIE>他获得过大笔的和解费
<5-11,ANNIE>I mean, he won some big settlements.

155
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,680
<5-11,ANNIE>但我想不到有什么能为他招来杀机
<5-11,ANNIE>But nothing I can imagine anyone killing for.

156
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,830
<5-12,BECKETT>克莱恩女士  整理出他手头所有的在办案件
<5-12,BECKETT>Ms. Klein, I need a list of all of his active cases,

157
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,290
<5-12,BECKETT>还有在过去几年里他打赢的所有官司
<5-12,BECKETT>along with anyone that he's won a judgment against

158
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:39,320
<5-12,BECKETT>我要这些案件的清单
<5-12,BECKETT>over the last few years.

159
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,320
<5-13,ANNIE>好的
<5-13,ANNIE>Of course.

160
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:43,500
<5-14,BECKETT>据我了解  法科先生住在布鲁克林
<5-14,BECKETT>So, I understand that Mr. Falco lived in brooklyn.

161
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,000
<5-15,ANNIE>是  就在公园坡
<5-15,ANNIE>Yeah -- Park Slope.

162
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,370
<5-16,BECKETT>他的尸体却在汉密尔顿高地
<5-16,BECKETT>His body was found in Hamilton heights.

163
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:49,820
<5-16,BECKETT>你知道他昨晚在那儿做什么吗
<5-16,BECKETT>Do you have any idea what he was doing up there last night?

164
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:52,180
<5-17,ANNIE>圣西蒙医院在那儿
<5-17,ANNIE>St. Simon's is up there.

165
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,630
<5-18,CASTLE>圣西蒙医院吗
<5-18,CASTLE>The hospital?

166
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:57,320
<5-19,ANNIE>嗯  有时候他会去急诊室转转
<5-19,ANNIE>Yes. Sometimes he would do the rounds at emergency rooms

167
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:59,250
<5-19,ANNIE>看有没有人需要他帮忙
<5-19,ANNIE>to see if anyone needed his services.

168
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,530
<6-1,ESPOSITO>收到你短信了  有什么要告诉我们的吗
<6-1,ESPOSITO>Got your text. You have something for us?

169
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,760
<6-2,LANIE>当然  我知道被害人死前在做什么
<6-2,LANIE>Yep. I know what your victim was doing before he died.

170
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,630
<6-3,RYAN>做什么
<6-3,RYAN>What?

171
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:10,200
<6-4,LANIE>你们先说
<6-4,LANIE>You first.

172
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:15,140
<6-5,RYAN>我知道了  她想知道我们的节目
<6-5,RYAN>I get it. She wants us to tell her about our routine.

173
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:18,090
<6-6,ESPOSITO>你知道我们不能泄露秘密的
<6-6,ESPOSITO>Uh, you know that we cannot be giving that away, girl.

174
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:21,370
<6-7,ESPOSITO>要知道的话就像别人一样买票吧
<6-7,ESPOSITO>You are gonna have to buy a ticket, just like everyone else.

175
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:23,220
<6-7,ESPOSITO>你发现了什么
<6-7,ESPOSITO>Now, what have you got?

176
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,680
<6-7,ESPOSITO>好吧
<6-7,ESPOSITO>Fine.

177
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,390
<6-8,LANIE>斗牛犬在乡下待过一段时间
<6-8,LANIE>Pitbull spent some time in the countryside.

178
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,470
<6-8,LANIE>这些黏糊糊的黄色粉末
<6-8,LANIE>You see this sticky yellow powder

179
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:31,740
<6-8,LANIE>粘在里奇长裤的踝关节位置  看到没
<6-8,LANIE>on Richie's pant leg about ankle high?

180
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:35,320
<6-8,LANIE>这是款冬花的花粉
<6-8,LANIE>Pollen from the tussilago flower, also know as coltsfoot.

181
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:37,980
<6-8,LANIE>城市里没有款冬花  所以不是在这儿粘的
<6-8,LANIE>It's not found in the city, so it didn't happen here.

182
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,000
<6-8,LANIE>还有别的线索
<6-8,LANIE>But there's something else --

183
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,980
<6-8,LANIE>这可比花间嬉戏没趣多了
<6-8,LANIE>Something a lot less fun than frolicking in the flowers.

184
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,260
<6-9,ESPOSITO>这些是电击枪的痕迹
<6-9,ESPOSITO>Those are taser marks.

185
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:50,740
<7-1,BECKETT>他遭受过折磨
<7-1,BECKETT>He was tortured?

186
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,720
<7-2,ESPOSITO>是  蕾妮说他身上这些伤
<7-2,ESPOSITO>Yeah, Lanie says the injuries he sustained

187
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,050
<7-2,ESPOSITO>是在他死前一小时内留下的
<7-2,ESPOSITO>were within an hour of his death.

188
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:56,290
<7-3,CASTLE>那么  要么凶手想从他那里得到什么
<7-3,CASTLE>So either the killer wanted something from him,

189
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,720
<7-3,CASTLE>而斗牛犬不肯松口
<7-3,CASTLE>something Pitbull didn't want to give up...

190
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,360
<7-4,BECKETT>要么凶手想让他受折磨
<7-4,BECKETT>Or the killer wanted him to suffer.

191
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,400
<7-5,ESPOSITO>这可能和他以前的案件有关联
<7-5,ESPOSITO>This might have something to do with one of his old cases.

192
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,790
<7-6,BECKETT>但他的客户列表里没什么不寻常
<7-6,BECKETT>Yeah, but nothing jumped out from his client list.

193
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,930
<7-6,BECKETT>都是些失足意外  工人赔偿  保险索赔之类的
<7-6,BECKETT>It's all slip-and-falls, workmen's comp, insurance claims --

194
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:09,010
<7-6,BECKETT>没什么能解释他为什么受折磨
<7-6,BECKETT>Nothing that would explain torture

195
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:10,820
<7-6,BECKETT>或是为什么要出城
<7-6,BECKETT>or a trip outside of the city.

196
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,160
<7-6,BECKETT>他去哪儿了
<7-6,BECKETT>So where did he go?

197
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,620
<7-7,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>卡塞尔先生  聊聊
<7-7,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>Mr. Castle? A word?

198
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:15,560
<7-8,CASTLE>当然
<7-8,CASTLE>Of course.

199
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:20,210
<7-9,GATES>你也知道  这周五要举办警方慈善协会才艺大赛
<7-9,GATES>As you know, the PBA talent competition is this friday,

200
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,860
<7-9,GATES>每年我们都会邀请名人表演
<7-9,GATES>And every year, we line up a celebrity to perform.

201
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,210
<7-10,ESPOSITO>对  为了多卖门票嘛
<7-10,ESPOSITO>Yeah, to help boost ticket sales.

202
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:26,430
<7-10,ESPOSITO>今年坎莫尔[脱口秀主持人]不来吗
<7-10,ESPOSITO>Isn't Kimmel doing it this year?

203
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:27,440
<7-11,GATES>本来说好了的
<7-11,GATES>He was supposed to,

204
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,120
<7-11,GATES>-但由于临时冲突  他不来了  -不会吧
<7-11,GATES>- but due to a last-second conflict, he just dropped out, - What?!

205
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,430
<7-13,GATES>他们告诉我要找个名人替补
<7-13,GATES>and I've been told we need a replacement celebrity.

206
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,600
<7-14,GATES>他们让我来邀请你
<7-14,GATES>I've been asked to ask you.

207
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,450
<7-15,CASTLE>要让我表演
<7-15,CASTLE>You want me to perform?

208
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:45,580
<7-16,GATES>我俩都会从中得到亟需的总局的友善对待
<7-16,GATES>It would earn us both some much-needed goodwill down at 1pp.

209
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,210
<7-17,ESPOSITO>票卖不出去怎么办嘞
<7-17,ESPOSITO>But what about ticket sales?

210
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,870
<7-18,CASTLE>我和贝克特很高兴去表演
<7-18,CASTLE>Beckett and I would be happy to.

211
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:49,910
<7-19,BECKETT>等等  什么
<7-19,BECKETT>Wait. What?

212
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,530
<7-20,CASTLE>有一个条件
<7-20,CASTLE>On one condition.

213
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,640
<7-20,CASTLE>尽管我不是个警察  我也得有资格争奖杯哦
<7-20,CASTLE>Even though I'm not a cop, we compete for the trophy.

214
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:55,620
<7-21,GATES>没问题
<7-21,GATES>Done.

215
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,340
<7-22,ESPOSITO>卡塞尔
<7-22,ESPOSITO>Oh, Castle.

216
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,810
<7-22,ESPOSITO>你还真以为你有机会争奖杯啊
<7-22,ESPOSITO>You really don't think you have a shot at winning that trophy?

217
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:05,160
<7-23,CASTLE>有很大机会呢
<7-23,CASTLE>Oh, I think I have more than just a shot.

218
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:07,250
<7-24,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<7-24,BECKETT>Castle?

219
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:11,130
<7-25,ESPOSITO>你知道我和莱恩排练好久了吧
<7-25,ESPOSITO>You do understand that me and Ryan have been rehearsing for months?

220
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:13,810
<7-26,CASTLE>我和贝克特之间都不用排练
<7-26,CASTLE>Well, what Beckett and I have cannot be rehearsed.

221
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,210
<7-26,CASTLE>我们之间是化学反应  心灵相通
<7-26,CASTLE>It's chemistry -- that intuitive bond,

222
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,350
<7-26,CASTLE>彼此知道对方的想法
<7-26,CASTLE>each person knowing what the other's thinking.

223
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:20,920
<7-27,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我们能到那儿聊一下吗
<7-27,BECKETT>Castle. Can we talk for a second over there?

224
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,620
<7-28,CASTLE>我早知道她要这么说
<7-28,CASTLE>I knew she was gonna say that.

225
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,190
<7-29,BECKETT>你不觉得拖我参加之前
<7-29,BECKETT>Don't you think you should have...asked me

226
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,770
<7-29,BECKETT>需要先问一下我的意见吗
<7-29,BECKETT>before signing me up for this?

227
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:32,870
<7-30,CASTLE>我以为你是同意的
<7-30,CASTLE>I thought you were on board.

228
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,990
<7-30,CASTLE>之前你还跟莱恩夸下海口呢
<7-30,CASTLE>Uh, you were trash-talking Ryan about it before.

229
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:36,620
<7-31,BECKETT>但当时我没想到我们真有机会
<7-31,BECKETT>Yeah, that's when I thought that there was no chance in hell

230
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:37,720
<7-31,BECKETT>参加这个比赛
<7-31,BECKETT>that we would actually do it.

231
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,790
<7-32,CASTLE>放轻松  我们就演平时的节目就好
<7-32,CASTLE>Oh, relax. We'll just do our routine.

232
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,510
<7-33,BECKETT>我们没有节目啊
<7-33,BECKETT>We don't have a routine.

233
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:44,480
<7-34,CASTLE>拜托  浴室里唱的那回呢  多愉快啊
<7-34,CASTLE>Come on! That thing in the shower? That is delightful.

234
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,160
<7-35,BECKETT>不  那不算数
<7-35,BECKETT>No. That's not a routine.

235
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,620
<7-35,BECKETT>那就是俩裸身男女
<7-35,BECKETT>That's two naked people singing

236
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,810
<7-35,BECKETT>在没人看到或听到的时候放声歌唱而已
<7-35,BECKETT>when there's no one around to see or hear it.

237
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,070
<7-36,CASTLE>那么我们就加上舞步加上服装
<7-36,CASTLE>So we'll add some dance steps and clothes.

238
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,190
<7-36,CASTLE>稳赢不输啊
<7-36,CASTLE>It's can't-miss.

239
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:54,740
<7-37,RYAN>伙计们
<7-37,RYAN>Uh, guys?

240
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,810
<7-38,ESPOSITO>哥们儿  等会儿
<7-38,ESPOSITO>Give them a second, bro.

241
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:57,790
<7-38,ESPOSITO>他俩在排练心灵感应呢
<7-38,ESPOSITO>They're rehearsing their chemistry.

242
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,580
<7-39,BECKETT>莱恩  你有什么线索了吗
<7-39,BECKETT>Ryan, you got something?

243
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:03,000
<7-40,RYAN>对  里奇昨晚确实在圣西蒙医院
<7-40,RYAN>Yeah -- turns out that richie was at st. Simon's last night,

244
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,170
<7-40,RYAN>而且他不是独自一人
<7-40,RYAN>and he was not alone.

245
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:09,700
<8-1,RYAN>这是圣西蒙医院后面的一个停车场
<8-1,RYAN>All right, so, here is the parking lot behind st. Simon's.

246
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,420
<8-1,RYAN>里奇在那儿
<8-1,RYAN>There's Richie.

247
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:14,020
<8-1,RYAN>看着
<8-1,RYAN>Now watch this.

248
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,710
<8-2,ESPOSITO>是辆跑车
<8-2,ESPOSITO>It's a sports car --

249
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,410
<8-2,ESPOSITO>逃离罪案现场的也是
<8-2,ESPOSITO>Like the one seen fleeing the crime scene.

250
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:23,620
<8-3,RYAN>显然车主和斗牛犬有些过节
<8-3,RYAN>And apparently, the driver had some kind of bf with pitbull.

251
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:26,270
<8-3,RYAN>车主把他塞进车里  然后开车离开了
<8-3,RYAN>He shoves him in the car and drives off.

252
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,360
<8-4,BECKETT>能看清车牌吗
<8-4,BECKETT>Can we make out the plate?

253
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,740
<8-5,RYAN>可以  已经查过了
<8-5,RYAN>Yeah. Already ran it.

254
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,520
<8-5,RYAN>是在这人名下的
<8-5,RYAN>It is registered to this guy --

255
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,730
<8-5,RYAN>德里克·博尔特
<8-5,RYAN>Derek Bolt.

256
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,510
<8-6,ESPOSITO>闪电德里克·博尔特  橄榄球联盟的前任跑锋
<8-6,ESPOSITO>Derek "Lightning" Bolt, the ex-nfl running back?

257
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:39,770
<8-7,CASTLE>前最有价值球员和斗牛犬有什么关联呢
<8-7,CASTLE>What's a former mvp doing with our ambulance-chasing pitbull?

258
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:41,680
<8-8,RYAN>不会是好事  看看时间
<8-8,RYAN>Nothing good. Check out the time stamp.

259
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:44,500
<8-8,RYAN>晚上11点  就在里奇被杀前几个小时
<8-8,RYAN>11:00 p.M. -- just hours before richie was killed.

260
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:47,200
<8-9,BECKETT>有足够的时间先折磨他
<8-9,BECKETT>Leaving enough time for him to be tortured first.

261
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,490
<9-1,ESPOSITO>就是他
<9-1,ESPOSITO>There he is.

262
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:54,600
<9-2,RYAN>德里克·博尔特
<9-2,RYAN>Derek bolt?

263
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:56,770
<9-3,ESPOSITO>我们想和你谈谈
<9-3,ESPOSITO>We'd like a word.

264
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:08,280
<9-4,DEREK BOLT>该死  放开我
<9-4,DEREK BOLT>Aw, man! Get off me, man!

265
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,380
<9-5,ESPOSITO>博尔特  你被逮捕了
<9-5,ESPOSITO>Guess what, bolt. You just got benched.

275
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,140
<9-5,ESPOSITO>终于来人了
<9-5,ESPOSITO>Finally!

276
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:24,140
<10-1,DEREK>有人给我解释一下为什么抓我吗
<10-1,DEREK>Someone gonna explain to me what I'm doing in here?

277
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,420
<10-2,RYAN>那你看到我们就跑
<10-2,RYAN>So, I guess you running away from us

278
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:27,250
<10-2,RYAN>是在怎么着  锻炼吗  里克
<10-2,RYAN>was, what, exercise, Derek?

279
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:28,910
<10-3,DEREK>拜托  我又不知道你们是警察
<10-3,DEREK>Hey, I didn't know you were cops.

280
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,990
<10-3,DEREK>听着  我遇到点财政问题好吧
<10-3,DEREK>Look, I got some financial troubles, all right?

281
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:32,550
<10-3,DEREK>你俩看起来像收债的
<10-3,DEREK>And you two looked like collection agents,

282
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,020
<10-3,DEREK>所以我的直觉就是跑了再说啊
<10-3,DEREK>so my instincts kicked in.

283
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,360
<10-3,DEREK>闪电可以离开全美橄榄球联盟
<10-3,DEREK>You can take lightning out of the NFL,

284
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,960
<10-3,DEREK>但你夺不走闪电的橄榄球本能啊
<10-3,DEREK>But you can't the NFL out of lightning, you know.

285
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,950
<10-4,BECKETT>我们很清楚你的财政问题  里克
<10-4,BECKETT>We know all about your financial troubles, Derek.

286
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:40,900
<10-5,RYAN>没错  我们知道
<10-5,RYAN>Yeah, we were just reading

287
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,860
<10-5,RYAN>你去年被人狠狠告了
<10-5,RYAN>how you got hit with a lawsuit last year

288
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,620
<10-5,RYAN>因为你在一家夜店外打了人
<10-5,RYAN>after you busted up some guy outside of a club.

289
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,890
<10-6,DEREK>当然要打  他撞凹了我的闪电车
<10-6,DEREK>Hell yeah. He dented the bolt-mobile.

290
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,730
<10-6,DEREK>我当时头脑发热
<10-6,DEREK>Look, I lost my head, all right?

291
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:50,120
<10-6,DEREK>但我后来再没找过他麻烦
<10-6,DEREK>But I've left him alone since.

292
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,580
<10-6,DEREK>闪电可不会出击两次
<10-6,DEREK>Lightning don't strike twice.

293
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:54,150
<10-7,BECKETT>不过你可没怎么原谅他的律师  对吧
<10-7,BECKETT>Except you weren't so forgiving of his lawyer, were you?

294
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,480
<10-7,BECKETT>斗牛犬
<10-7,BECKETT>Pitbull?

295
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:57,950
<10-8,DEREK>他跟这事有什么关系
<10-8,DEREK>What's he got to do with any of this?

296
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:00,130
<10-9,BECKETT>他去年达成了一项对你很不利的庭外和解
<10-9,BECKETT>He won a big settlement against you last year

297
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,790
<10-9,BECKETT>让你破了产
<10-9,BECKETT>and sent you into bankruptcy.

298
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,190
<10-10,DEREK>所以呢
<10-10,DEREK>So?

299
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:05,410
<10-11,RYAN>所以斗牛犬死了  里克
<10-11,RYAN>So pitbull's dead, Derek.

300
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,980
<10-13,BECKETT>-什么  -而他最后一次被人看到
<10-13,BECKETT>- What? - And the last time he was seen,

301
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:11,790
<10-13,BECKETT>就是昨晚11点被你推进了闪电车
<10-13,BECKETT>he was being shoved into your bolt-mobile at 11:00 p.m.

302
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,560
<10-14,DEREK>不是看起来那样
<10-14,DEREK>Hey, hey, that -- that ain't what it looks like.

303
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,210
<10-15,BECKETT>是吗  目前看来这就是复仇
<10-15,BECKETT>Really? Because right now, it looks like revenge.

304
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:18,800
<10-16,DEREK>我没杀斗牛犬  好吧
<10-16,DEREK>I-I did not kill Pitbull, all right?

305
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,550
<10-16,DEREK>他在法庭上针对我时表现太好了
<10-16,DEREK>Look, dawg did such a good job against me in court,

306
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:22,980
<10-16,DEREK>我想让他加入我的团队
<10-16,DEREK>I wanted him on my team.

307
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,660
<10-16,DEREK>所以我去雇了他
<10-16,DEREK>So I went and hired his ass.

308
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,730
<10-17,BECKETT>你雇了里奇
<10-17,BECKETT>Richie was working for you?

309
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:29,430
<10-17,BECKETT>那你怎么不在他的客户名单里
<10-17,BECKETT>Well, then why weren't you on his client list?

310
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,470
<10-18,DEREK>我找他是因为亲子鉴定这种事
<10-18,DEREK>It's a paternity thing, all right?

311
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:34,080
<10-18,DEREK>我老婆快受不了我了
<10-18,DEREK>My old lady's just about had it with me,

312
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,740
<10-18,DEREK>所以他是在私下处理的
<10-18,DEREK>so he was handling this off the books.

313
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,160
<10-19,RYAN>但这也不能解释
<10-19,RYAN>Okay, but none of that

314
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,380
<10-19,RYAN>你昨晚强迫他上车的事
<10-19,RYAN>explains your little joyride last night.

315
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,190
<10-20,DEREK>我和里奇昨天下午
<10-20,DEREK>Me and Richie were supposed to meet up

316
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:44,640
<10-20,DEREK>本来要跟我孩他妈和她的律师团队碰面的
<10-20,DEREK>with my baby mama and her lawyer yesterday afternoon.

317
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,600
<10-20,DEREK>可里奇没出现  让我非常丢脸
<10-20,DEREK>Only, Richie never showed up, and it made me look bad.

318
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,650
<10-20,DEREK>所以我请他上我的车小聊了一下
<10-20,DEREK>So I invited him into my car for a little conversation.

319
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,180
<12-1,ELISE RESNER>他说他很抱歉
<12-1,ELISE RESNER>He said he was sorry

320
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,610
<10-20,DEREK>说临时遇到点紧急业务
<10-20,DEREK>and that some urgent business matter came up.

321
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:55,750
<10-21,BECKETT>什么业务
<10-21,BECKETT>What kind of business?

322
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,710
<10-21,BECKETT>关于结算债务的
<10-21,BECKETT>Something about settling a debt.

323
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:59,450
<10-22,DEREK>他说他会处理我的事
<10-22,DEREK>He told me he'd handle my thing,

324
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:01,220
<10-22,DEREK>但希望我能稍他去个什么餐厅
<10-22,DEREK>but he wanted me to take him to some diner

325
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,510
<10-22,DEREK>他晚上要在那见个人
<10-22,DEREK>for a late-night meet.

326
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:04,180
<10-22,DEREK>说事关人命
<10-22,DEREK>Said someone's life depended on it.

327
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,660
<10-22,DEREK>看来就是他的命啊
<10-22,DEREK>Guess maybe it was his.

328
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:11,050
<11-1,RYAN>24小时健身房的经理证实了
<11-1,RYAN>So, the manager at the 24-hour gym

329
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,460
<11-1,RYAN>里奇被杀期间
<11-1,RYAN>confirms that Derek was working out there

330
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,280
<11-1,RYAN>里克正在那里健身
<11-1,RYAN>during Richie's time-of-death window,

331
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,110
<11-1,RYAN>他不是凶手
<11-1,RYAN>So he's not our killer.

332
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:18,840
<11-2,CASTLE>也就是说里克说把里奇捎到了餐厅
<11-2,CASTLE>Which means derek might have been telling the truth

333
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,300
<11-2,CASTLE>可能是实话
<11-2,CASTLE>about dropping richie off at that diner.

334
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,340
<11-3,RYAN>我过去查查
<11-3,RYAN>Yeah, I'll head over there,

335
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,410
<11-3,RYAN>看有没有服务员记得
<11-3,RYAN>see if the waitstaff remembers richie

336
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:23,890
<11-3,RYAN>里奇昨晚跟什么人说过话
<11-3,RYAN>talking with anyone last night.

337
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:26,010
<11-4,BECKETT>这还是不能解释他白天在哪里
<11-4,BECKETT>It still doesn't explain where he was during the day,

338
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:28,380
<11-4,BECKETT>他为什么翘班  爽约没去参加客户面谈
<11-4,BECKETT>why he missed work or blew off that client meeting.

339
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,280
<11-5,ESPOSITO>也许我知道可以问谁
<11-5,ESPOSITO>I may know someone we can ask.

340
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,750
<11-6,BECKETT>埃斯波  你怎么了
<11-6,BECKETT>Espo, what happened?

341
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,960
<11-7,ESPOSITO>我放倒闪电的时候扭到了膝盖
<11-7,ESPOSITO>I twisted my knee when I was tackling lightning.

342
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,960
<11-8,BECKETT>你这...没事吧
<11-8,BECKETT>Wh... are you gonna be okay?

343
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:41,530
<11-9,ESPOSITO>没事  就是扭了一下
<11-9,ESPOSITO>Yeah, I'll be fine. I just, uh...I just tweaked it.

344
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:42,590
<11-9,ESPOSITO>可能扭伤了
<11-9,ESPOSITO>It's probably a sprain.

345
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:43,520
<11-10,CASTLE>那可太糟了
<11-10,CASTLE>Oh, that's too bad.

346
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,650
<11-10,CASTLE>我还想在才艺大赛上打败你呢
<11-10,CASTLE>I was looking forward to beating you in the talent competition.

347
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,280
<11-11,ESPOSITO>你以为这会让我退出吗
<11-11,ESPOSITO>You think this is gonna take me out?

348
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:51,240
<11-12,CASTLE>对  我觉得会
<11-12,CASTLE>Yes. Yes, I do.

349
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,990
<11-13,ESPOSITO>不  我还是要上
<11-13,ESPOSITO>No. It's still on.

350
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:54,740
<11-14,BECKETT>这...怎么上
<11-14,BECKETT>Uh, ge-- I-I-I mean, how?

351
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,160
<11-14,BECKETT>埃斯波  你连路都走不了了
<11-14,BECKETT>Espo, you can barely walk.

352
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,950
<11-15,ESPOSITO>是  但就算只有一条腿
<11-15,ESPOSITO>Yeah, and even on one leg,

353
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:00,270
<11-15,ESPOSITO>我跟莱恩还是会完爆你们
<11-15,ESPOSITO>Ryan and I are still gonna whip your sorry asses.

354
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:01,890
<11-15,ESPOSITO>这样吧  打个赌怎么样
<11-15,ESPOSITO>In fact, how about a wager?

355
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:04,590
<11-16,RYAN>搭档  也许我们该商量下...
<11-16,RYAN>Um, uh, partner, you know, maybe w-we should discuss --

356
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:08,320
<11-17,ESPOSITO>要是我们赢了  你下本书就要写
<11-17,ESPOSITO>If we win, then you will dedicate your next book

357
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,790
<11-17,ESPOSITO>献给埃斯波西托和莱恩
<11-17,ESPOSITO>To "Esposito and Ryan,

358
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,340
<11-17,ESPOSITO>两个比我幽默  比我帅气
<11-17,ESPOSITO>"Two guys who are funnier, handsomer,

359
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:14,180
<11-17,ESPOSITO>在各方面都胜过我的人
<11-17,ESPOSITO>and better than me in every way."

360
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:17,950
<11-18,CASTLE>你说真的啊
<11-18,CASTLE>Oh, you're serious.

361
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:20,760
<11-19,CASTLE>那要是我和贝克特赢了呢
<11-19,CASTLE>And if Beckett and I win?

362
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:22,370
<11-20,ESPOSITO>那我和莱恩就会叫你
<11-20,ESPOSITO>Well, then Ryan and I

363
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:24,640
<11-20,ESPOSITO>"卡塞尔大帝"  叫一个月
<11-20,ESPOSITO>will call you "King Castle" for a month.

364
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:25,860
<11-21,RYAN>哈维...
<11-21,RYAN>Hey, Javi --

365
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:26,840
<11-21,RYAN>我是说...
<11-21,RYAN>I mean --

366
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,150
<11-22,ESPOSITO>-怎么样  -知道吗
<11-22,ESPOSITO>- What do you say? - Yeah, you know what?

367
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,080
<11-22,ESPOSITO>我同意莱恩
<11-22,ESPOSITO>I think Ryan's right.

368
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:33,000
<11-23,BECKETT>我们没必要为这事打赌吧
<11-23,BECKETT>I mean, we don't need to make a bet out of this.

369
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:35,090
<11-24,ESPOSITO>为什么  因为你是懦夫
<11-24,ESPOSITO>Why? Because you're chicken?

370
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,460
<11-25,BECKETT>不  因为我是个成年人
<11-25,BECKETT>No. Because I am a grown-up.

371
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,010
<11-26,ESPOSITO>是啊  成年懦夫
<11-26,ESPOSITO>Yeah -- a grown-up chicken.

372
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:45,190
<11-27,CASTLE>你们叫我"殿下"也行
<11-27,CASTLE>I will also accept "Your royal highness."

373
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:46,630
<11-27,CASTLE>就这么定了  跛子
<11-27,CASTLE>You're on, gimpy.

374
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:48,810
<11-28,ESPOSITO>这话够狠
<11-28,ESPOSITO>That's clever.

375
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,280
<11-29,CASTLE>这叫现炒现卖
<11-29,CASTLE>I work with what you give me.

376
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:51,850
<11-30,ESPOSITO>我一定会拿下你
<11-30,ESPOSITO>I'm gonna take you down.

377
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:52,890
<11-31,CASTLE>用什么拿  你的拐杖吗
<11-31,CASTLE>With what -- your crutches?

378
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:54,080
<11-32,BECKETT>咱们能回到死者身上了吗
<11-32,BECKETT>Can we get back to the dead guy?

379
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,340
<11-32,BECKETT>你说你找到个人
<11-32,BECKETT>You said that you found someone

380
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:58,030
<11-32,BECKETT>能告诉我们里奇昨天为什么翘了工作
<11-32,BECKETT>who could tell us why Richie missed work yesterday.

381
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:59,880
<11-33,ESPOSITO>对  我查了他的电话和财务记录
<11-33,ESPOSITO>Yes. I pulled his phone and financials.

382
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,920
<11-33,ESPOSITO>他的信用卡昨天没有消费记录
<11-33,ESPOSITO>There were no charges on his credit card yesterday,

383
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,240
<11-33,ESPOSITO>但他打过一个电话
<11-33,ESPOSITO>but he made a call --

384
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:05,340
<11-33,ESPOSITO>昨天一整天  他只打了这一个电话
<11-33,ESPOSITO>The only call he made from his cell all day.

385
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,160
<11-34,BECKETT>打给谁了
<11-34,BECKETT>To whom?

386
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,610
<11-35,ESPOSITO>一个他多年没联系过的人
<11-35,ESPOSITO>Someone he hasn't called in years --

387
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:09,500
<11-35,ESPOSITO>他的前妻  艾丽莎·莱斯纳
<11-35,ESPOSITO>His ex-wife, Elise Resner.

388
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,640
<12-1,ELISE RESNER>他说遇到了麻烦  需要我的帮助
<12-1,ELISE RESNER>He said he was in trouble and needed my help.

389
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,350
<12-2,BECKETT>具体什么样的麻烦
<12-2,BECKETT>What kind of trouble, exactly?

390
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:16,900
<12-3,ELISE>探长  你得明白
<12-3,ELISE>Detective, you have to understand --

391
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,230
<12-3,ELISE>我已经多年没跟他联系过了
<12-3,ELISE>I hadn't spoken to him in years.

392
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:22,080
<12-3,ELISE>然后他就突然打来了电话
<12-3,ELISE>And then he just calls out of the blue.

393
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,050
<12-4,BECKETT>你根本没问
<12-4,BECKETT>You never asked.

394
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:25,280
<12-5,ELISE>我根本不想知道
<12-5,ELISE>I didn't want to know.

395
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,180
<12-5,ELISE>经过了我跟他之间发生的那些事
<12-5,ELISE>After everything that happened between us,

396
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,120
<12-5,ELISE>我知道我不能再被卷进去了
<12-5,ELISE>I knew I couldn't get involved again.

397
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:31,230
<12-6,BECKETT>你们之间发生了什么
<12-6,BECKETT>What happened between the two of you?

398
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:33,030
<12-7,ELISE>我们以前在同一家企业法律所
<12-7,ELISE>We were at the same corporate firm.

399
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,340
<12-7,ELISE>我们就是在那相识的
<12-7,ELISE>It's how we met.

400
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,780
<12-8,BECKETT>企业法
<12-8,BECKETT>Corporate law?

401
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:38,580
<12-8,BECKETT>他怎么成了个受理人身伤害的律师
<12-8,BECKETT>How did he end up a personal-injury attorney?

402
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,040
<12-9,ELISE>他当年可是业内巨星
<12-9,ELISE>He was a superstar --

403
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:42,780
<12-9,ELISE>上过《哈佛法学评论》  有机会当合伙人
<12-9,ELISE>Harvard law review, partner track.

404
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:44,800
<12-9,ELISE>但后来一定是压力太大了
<12-9,ELISE>But the pressure got to be too much for him.

405
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,170
<12-9,ELISE>大约五年前  他开始堕落
<12-9,ELISE>About five years back, he self-destructed --

406
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,590
<12-9,ELISE>酗酒  吸毒
<12-9,ELISE>drinking, drugs...

407
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:51,310
<12-9,ELISE>输掉所有的官司  丢了工作
<12-9,ELISE>losing all of his cases, uh, his job...

408
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,910
<12-9,ELISE>最后也失去了我
<12-9,ELISE>then, finally, me.

409
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,820
<12-10,ESPOSITO>贝克特  有情况
<12-10,ESPOSITO>Hey, Beckett, we got a situation.

410
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,500
<13-1,ANNIE>我吃完午餐回来  发现门半开着
<13-1,ANNIE>I came back from lunch to find the door half-open,

411
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,350
<13-1,ANNIE>锁被撬了
<13-1,ANNIE>the lock was broken,

412
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:06,780
<13-1,ANNIE>还有...其他的你们都看到了
<13-1,ANNIE>and -- well, you can -- you can see the rest.

413
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:08,590
<13-2,ESPOSITO>知道他们是在找什么吗
<13-2,ESPOSITO>Any idea what they were looking for?

414
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,210
<13-3,ANNIE>我还在清点东西
<13-3,ANNIE>I'm still sorting through the mess.

415
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:11,830
<13-3,ANNIE>不过里奇的电脑不见了
<13-3,ANNIE>But Richie's computer is gone,

416
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:13,250
<13-3,ANNIE>而且还有别的
<13-3,ANNIE>And there's something else.

417
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,190
<13-3,ANNIE>他所有案卷都不见了
<13-3,ANNIE>All of his case files are missing.

418
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,690
<13-4,BECKETT>为什么有人要偷里奇的案卷
<13-4,BECKETT>Why would anyone want Richie's files?

419
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:19,740
<13-4,BECKETT>肯定和他之前处理的某件案子有关...
<13-4,BECKETT>This must have something to do with one of his cases --

420
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,320
<13-5,ESPOSITO>某个客户  或是某个证人...
<13-5,ESPOSITO>Client, maybe a witness...

421
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,890
<13-5,ESPOSITO>被他调查过的某个人或某件事
<13-5,ESPOSITO>Someone or something that he was looking into,

422
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:25,550
<13-5,ESPOSITO>他连你都不愿告诉的事情
<13-5,ESPOSITO>something he was hiding even from you.

423
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:27,960
<13-6,BECKETT>我们先排查这幢楼
<13-6,BECKETT>Okay, let's canvass the building,

424
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:29,710
<13-6,BECKETT>看看有没有人看到了什么
<13-6,BECKETT>see if anyone else saw something.

425
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:31,240
<13-6,BECKETT>叫鉴证科的人过来
<13-6,BECKETT>And get CSU down here.

426
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,070
<13-6,BECKETT>指纹  纤维  DNA等等
<13-6,BECKETT>Prints, fibers, DNA -- the whole thing.

427
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:33,980
<13-7,ESPOSITO>好的
<13-7,ESPOSITO>Right.

428
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:35,560
<13-8,BECKETT>抱歉
<13-8,BECKETT>Excuse me.

430
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:37,740
<13-8,BECKETT>是我
<13-8,BECKETT>It's me.

431
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:38,840
<13-9,RYAN>你还记得那个里奇说的
<13-9,RYAN>Do you remember that meeting

432
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,120
<13-9,RYAN>他昨晚在一个餐厅和别人的会面吗
<13-9,RYAN>that Richie said he had in a diner last night?

433
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:41,980
<13-10,BECKETT>是的
<13-10,BECKETT>Yeah.

434
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,110
<13-11,RYAN>一个服务生看到了整个过程
<13-11,RYAN>Well, a waitress saw the whole thing.

435
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,740
<13-11,RYAN>不如说是场吵架
<13-11,RYAN>A lot more like a fight.

436
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,710
<13-11,RYAN>里奇和另外一个人吵的不可开交
<13-11,RYAN>Richie got in a shouting match with another guy.

437
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,010
<13-12,BECKETT>有相貌描述吗
<13-12,BECKETT>You get a description?

438
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:51,360
<13-13,RYAN>比那个更好
<13-13,RYAN>Uh, better than that.

439
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,910
<13-13,RYAN>服务生都认出那个人是谁了
<13-13,RYAN>Waitress knew exactly who he was.

440
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,300
<13-13,RYAN>马上给你发照片过去
<13-13,RYAN>I'll send you a picture.

442
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,200
<13-13,RYAN>这是阿奇·布朗斯坦
<13-13,RYAN>That's Archie Bronstein,

443
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,560
<14-1,ANNIE>"草原巨锤"
<14-1,ANNIE>"The Savannah Hammer."

444
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:05,450
<14-2,BECKETT>里奇和这人会因为什么吵起来吗
<14-2,BECKETT>Is there any reason that Richie and the Hammer would be fighting?

445
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:07,670
<14-3,ANNIE>他们经常互相窃取对方的客户
<14-3,ANNIE>They were always stealing clients from each other.

446
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:09,230
<14-3,ANNIE>只不过里奇更厉害一点
<14-3,ANNIE>Only, Richie was better at it.

447
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:11,940
<14-3,ANNIE>终于锤子受不了老是输给他
<14-3,ANNIE>It got to where Hammer was so sick of losing business to him

448
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,030
<14-3,ANNIE>他就...
<14-3,ANNIE>that he...

449
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,100
<14-3,ANNIE>他就说一定给这事儿做个了结
<14-3,ANNIE>He promised to put an end to it.

450
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:19,010
<14-3,ANNIE>不论如何
<14-3,ANNIE>One way or another.

451
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:20,590
<14-4,BECKETT>我们怎么才能找到他
<14-4,BECKETT>Where can we find him?

452
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:22,890
<15-1,ARCHIE BRONSTEIN>给我打电话  朋友
<15-1,ARCHIE BRONSTEIN>Call me, friend.

453
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:24,670
<15-1,ARCHIE BRONSTEIN>发生在你身上的事
<15-1,ARCHIE BRONSTEIN>Whatever happened to you is nothing

454
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:26,360
<15-1,ARCHIE BRONSTEIN>和我要对那家伙做的根本不值一提
<15-1,ARCHIE BRONSTEIN>compared to what I'm gonna do to the other guy.

455
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,750
<15-2,BECKETT>阿奇·布朗斯坦先生
<15-2,BECKETT>Mr. Archie Bronstein?

456
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:30,280
<15-2,BECKETT>叫我草原巨锤
<15-2,BECKETT>The Savannah Hammer.

457
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,410
<15-3,ARCHIE>案子再小也要做  和解多大都要争取
<15-3,ARCHIE>No case too small, no settlement too big.

458
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:33,910
<15-3,ARCHIE>有什么能为你们效劳的吗
<15-3,ARCHIE>Now, what can I help you with?

459
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,620
<15-3,ARCHIE>滑到摔跤  工伤  医疗事故
<15-3,ARCHIE>Slip-and-fall? Work injury? Medical malpractice?

460
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,250
<15-4,BECKETT>我们是为斗牛犬里奇的被害而来的
<15-4,BECKETT>We're here about the murder of Richie the Pitbull.

461
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,790
<16-1,ARCHIE>是的  那晚我是在那个餐厅
<16-1,ARCHIE>Sure, I was at that diner last night.

462
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:45,980
<16-1,ARCHIE>你们俩的这个紧急会面...
<16-1,ARCHIE>This urgent meeting that the two of you had --

463
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,020
<16-2,BECKETT>是关于什么的
<16-2,BECKETT>What was it about?

464
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,100
<16-3,ARCHIE>我觉得根本不能算是会面
<16-3,ARCHIE>I'd hardly call it a meeting.

465
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,350
<16-3,ARCHIE>我就是想去吃个核桃派的
<16-3,ARCHIE>I went in to get some pecan pie,

466
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:50,640
<16-3,ARCHIE>然后就看到他坐在那里
<16-3,ARCHIE>and I saw him sitting there.

467
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:52,400
<16-4,CASTLE>这个会面不是事先安排好的
<16-4,CASTLE>So the meeting wasn't planned?

468
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:54,430
<16-5,ARCHIE>也许他本打算和别的什么人碰面的吧
<16-5,ARCHIE>Well, maybe he was planning on meeting someone else,

469
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,660
<16-5,ARCHIE>反正我看到他在那个隔间里的时候
<16-5,ARCHIE>but when I saw him in that booth,

470
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,250
<16-5,ARCHIE>他就一个人  然后我们就吵了起来
<16-5,ARCHIE>he was alone, and we got into it.

471
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,080
<16-6,BECKETT>吵什么了
<16-6,BECKETT>About what?

472
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,000
<16-7,ARCHIE>就是那些...我昨晚在这儿
<16-7,ARCHIE>The usual -- I caught him here last night

473
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,640
<16-7,ARCHIE>抓到他想偷走我的一个客户
<16-7,ARCHIE>trying to poach one of my clients.

474
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,480
<16-7,ARCHIE>在这儿吵了一架然后餐厅又吵了
<16-7,ARCHIE>We had words here and then again at the diner.

475
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,780
<16-8,CASTLE>里奇一直妄想觉得被跟踪了
<16-8,CASTLE>So, Richie was paranoid he was being followed,

476
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,430
<16-8,CASTLE>消失整天不见  说他有麻烦了
<16-8,CASTLE>disappears all day, says he's in trouble,

477
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:09,760
<16-8,CASTLE>然后还到这儿来偷你的客户
<16-8,CASTLE>then comes here to poach a client?

478
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,290
<16-9,BECKETT>布朗斯坦先生  有什么具体的原因
<16-9,BECKETT>Mr. Bronstein, was there a specific reason

479
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,180
<16-9,BECKETT>让他对这个客户这么感兴趣吗
<16-9,BECKETT>that he was interested in this client?

480
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:15,480
<16-10,ARCHIE>他觉得这个案子很好弄
<16-10,ARCHIE>He smelled an easy win.

481
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,480
<16-10,ARCHIE>可怜女孩的车被收旧货的卡车撞上
<16-10,ARCHIE>Poor girl gets three pieces of flying metal in her heart

482
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,600
<16-10,ARCHIE>三个金属碎片插进了心脏
<16-10,ARCHIE>when a scrap truck plows into her car.

483
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,780
<16-10,ARCHIE>是个板上钉钉的和解案
<16-10,ARCHIE>Now, that is a slam-dunk settlement.

484
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,410
<16-10,ARCHIE>所以看到他在餐厅的时候
<16-10,ARCHIE>So you bet when I saw Richie at that diner,

485
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:27,740
<16-10,ARCHIE>自然就吵了起来
<16-10,ARCHIE>we got loud.

486
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:29,780
<16-10,ARCHIE>服务生最后让我们出去解决问题
<16-10,ARCHIE>So the waitress told us to take it outside,

487
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:32,780
<16-10,ARCHIE>我就跟他说最好离我的客户远一点
<16-10,ARCHIE>where I advised him to steer clear of my clients.

488
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:34,650
<16-11,BECKETT>那时候是几点
<16-11,BECKETT>And what time was that?

489
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,290
<16-12,ARCHIE>大约11:45
<16-12,ARCHIE>11:45 maybe.

490
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:38,530
<16-12,ARCHIE>听着  我没有杀他
<16-12,ARCHIE>Look, I didn't kill him.

491
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:40,120
<16-12,ARCHIE>我也没有偷那些案卷
<16-12,ARCHIE>I didn't steal those files.

492
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:42,350
<16-12,ARCHIE>不过这一切说不定和
<16-12,ARCHIE>But it might be related

493
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:45,180
<16-12,ARCHIE>他的..."课外活动"有关
<16-12,ARCHIE>to his... extracurricular activities.

494
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,670
<16-13,CASTLE>什么意思
<16-13,CASTLE>Uh, what's that mean?

495
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,140
<16-14,ARCHIE>里奇总觉得他比我们都要厉害
<16-14,ARCHIE>Richie liked to come off like he was better than all of us,

496
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,340
<16-14,ARCHIE>就因为他有哈佛的学位
<16-14,ARCHIE>with his Harvard degree

497
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:53,840
<16-14,ARCHIE>和他为小人物伸冤的那套样子
<16-14,ARCHIE>and his "champion of the little guy" act,

498
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,440
<16-14,ARCHIE>相信我...他卷入了一些事
<16-14,ARCHIE>but trust me -- he was into some things.

499
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,070
<16-15,CASTLE>什么样的事
<16-15,CASTLE>What kind of things?

500
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:59,240
<16-16,ARCHIE>坏事
<16-16,ARCHIE>Bad things.

501
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,840
<16-16,ARCHIE>外面流传的说法是
<16-16,ARCHIE>Word on the street was,

502
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,320
<16-16,ARCHIE>只要开价  没有什么他不会做的
<16-16,ARCHIE>there was nothing he wouldn't do for a price.

503
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:06,020
<16-16,ARCHIE>无论什么事
<16-16,ARCHIE>And I mean nothing.

504
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:10,770
<17-1,ESPOSITO>看来"锤子"并不是凶手
<17-1,ESPOSITO>So, it looks like Hammer's not our killer.

505
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,600
<17-1,ESPOSITO>显然  在离开餐厅之后
<17-1,ESPOSITO>Apparently, after he left the diner,

506
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,430
<17-1,ESPOSITO>他整晚都在花费心思"争取"一位客户
<17-1,ESPOSITO>he spent the rest of the night "nailing" one of his clients.

507
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:16,910
<17-1,ESPOSITO>除了案卷和电脑之外
<17-1,ESPOSITO>Anything else turn up missing

508
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:18,260
<17-1,ESPOSITO>还有什么东西不见了吗
<17-1,ESPOSITO>besides the files and the computer?

509
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,790
<17-2,RYAN>没  目前还没有
<17-2,RYAN>No, not so far.

510
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:22,070
<17-2,RYAN>这我就不太明白了...
<17-2,RYAN>This is what I don't get --

511
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:23,860
<17-2,RYAN>如果他们就想要案卷的话
<17-2,RYAN>If all they wanted was files,

512
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,450
<17-2,RYAN>为何还要把这里翻个底朝天呢
<17-2,RYAN>why'd they turn this place upside down?

513
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:27,170
<17-3,ESPOSITO>一定是在找其他什么东西
<17-3,ESPOSITO>Must have been looking for something else.

514
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:30,570
<17-3,ESPOSITO>警探们  你们得过来看看这个
<17-3,ESPOSITO>Detectives, you need to see this.

515
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:36,940
<17-3,ESPOSITO>我们在墙上发现了一处暗柜  看看吧
<17-3,ESPOSITO>We found a false panel in the wall. Take a look.

516
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,140
<18-1,CSU TECH>绳索  强力胶带...
<18-1,CSU TECH>Rope, duct tape...

517
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,640
<18-2,ESPOSITO>布  手套...
<18-2,ESPOSITO>rags, gloves...

518
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,380
<18-2,ESPOSITO>氯仿
<18-2,ESPOSITO>chloroform.

519
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,470
<18-3,RYAN>看来某人是要策划一出绑架
<18-3,RYAN>Looks like somebody was planning an abduction.

520
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:59,180
<18-4,ESPOSITO>他估计已经过了策划的阶段了
<18-4,ESPOSITO>He might have went past the planning phase.

521
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,810
<18-5,RYAN>荧光棒使用之后
<18-5,RYAN>Glow sticks last, what,

522
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:04,170
<18-5,RYAN>能持续有24到48小时吧
<18-5,RYAN>24 to 48 hours once activated?

523
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:05,710
<18-5,RYAN>这些还在亮着
<18-5,RYAN>And they're still glowing.

524
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:07,360
<18-6,ESPOSITO>说明他在过去的两天内
<18-6,ESPOSITO>Which means he must have used this bag

525
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,460
<18-6,ESPOSITO>用过这一袋子东西了
<18-6,ESPOSITO>within the last two days.

526
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,450
<18-6,ESPOSITO>是啊
<18-6,ESPOSITO>Yeah.

527
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:10,860
<18-7,RYAN>不过做了什么呢
<18-7,RYAN>But for what?

528
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,670
<19-1,RYAN>刚从鉴证科过来
<19-1,RYAN>Well, I just got off with CSU.

529
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:19,920
<19-1,RYAN>这块布上面检测到了氯仿
<19-1,RYAN>That rag tested positive for chloroform.

530
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:21,980
<19-2,BECKETT>说明他用这个迷晕过某个人
<19-2,BECKETT>So he must have used it to knock someone out.

531
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:24,250
<19-3,CASTLE>这可不太像律师的作风啊
<19-3,CASTLE>Not very lawyerly of Mr. Pitbull.

532
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:27,410
<19-4,BECKETT>钢丝钳  警报器原理图
<19-4,BECKETT>So, wire cutters, alarm schematics,

533
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:30,080
<19-4,BECKETT>夜视仪  还有荧光棒
<19-4,BECKETT>night-vision goggles, and glow sticks.

534
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,240
<19-5,RYAN>他是想闯入某个地方  可是哪里呢
<19-5,RYAN>He's breaking in somewhere. But where?

535
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,520
<19-5,RYAN>好  我来查查记录
<19-5,RYAN>All right, I'll check the blotters,

536
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,500
<19-6,ESPOSITO>看看过去两天里有没有什么入室盗窃
<19-6,ESPOSITO>see if there were any B&Es in the past two days,

537
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,430
<19-6,ESPOSITO>看看有没有和里奇的案子有关的
<19-6,ESPOSITO>see if I can link any of them to Richie's cases.

538
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:39,360
<19-7,BECKETT>好的  别忘了也查查失踪人口报告
<19-7,BECKETT>Yeah, and look into missing-persons reports.

539
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,180
<19-7,BECKETT>还不能排除是绑架的可能
<19-7,BECKETT>We still can't rule out an abduction.

540
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,320
<19-7,BECKETT>好的
<19-7,BECKETT>Yeah.

541
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:44,500
<19-8,ESPOSITO>看看这个
<19-8,ESPOSITO>Check this out.

542
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,540
<19-9,BECKETT>城市名和日期
<19-9,BECKETT>Cities and dates.

543
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:51,130
<19-9,BECKETT>"2009年1月3日  西雅图
<19-9,BECKETT>"January 3, 2009, Seattle.

544
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:53,350
<19-9,BECKETT>2011年3月18日  塔尔萨"
<19-9,BECKETT>March 18, 2011, Tulsa."

545
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:55,970
<19-10,CASTLE>六个都是在过去五年里
<19-10,CASTLE>Six of them all within the last five years.

546
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:57,000
<19-10,CASTLE>你觉得这些是什么意思
<19-10,CASTLE>What do you think that means?

547
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,850
<19-11,BECKETT>让托瑞在数据库里查查这些
<19-11,BECKETT>Have Tory run this through the database,

548
00:19:58,850 --> 00:19:59,650
<19-11,BECKETT>看看能找到什么
<19-11,BECKETT>see if she can find anything.

549
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:01,640
<19-11,BECKETT>看看她能不能追查到里奇
<19-11,BECKETT>And let's see if she can trace where Richie was

550
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,540
<19-11,BECKETT>给他前妻打电话的时候在哪里
<19-11,BECKETT>when he made that phone call to his ex.

551
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,760
<19-12,ESPOSITO>你觉得这些和医院里的那个女孩有关联吗
<19-12,ESPOSITO>You think any of this is connected to that girl at the hospital?

552
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,210
<19-13,BECKETT>不  那就是起简单的交通事故...
<19-13,BECKETT>No, that was a straight-up car accident --

553
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:08,810
<19-13,BECKETT>和这些应该都没有关系
<19-13,BECKETT>Nothing that speaks to any of this.

554
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:11,340
<19-13,BECKETT>一定有人知道里奇究竟做了什么
<19-13,BECKETT>But someone out there has to know what Richie was up to.

555
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,820
<19-14,RYAN>也许我们可以问问桑普森先生
<19-14,RYAN>Well, maybe we should ask Mr. Sampson.

556
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:15,450
<19-15,BECKETT>桑普森先生是谁
<19-15,BECKETT>Who's Mr. Sampson?

557
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:18,530
<19-16,RYAN>不知道  不过这是他的夜视镜
<19-16,RYAN>I don't know, but these are his night-vision goggles.

559
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,410
<20-1,MIKE SAMPSON>是的  是我的
<20-1,MIKE SAMPSON>Yeah. They're mine.

560
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,910
<20-2,BECKETT>你怎么认识死者的  桑普森先生
<20-2,BECKETT>How did you know the victim, Mr. Sampson?

561
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,200
<20-3,SAMPSON>我给里奇干过几次活
<20-3,SAMPSON>I did work for Richie here and there.

562
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,470
<20-3,SAMPSON>监视  搜集情报什么的
<20-3,SAMPSON>Surveillance, information gathering --

563
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:32,700
<20-3,SAMPSON>一般私家侦探干的那些事
<20-3,SAMPSON>The usual P.I. stuff.

564
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,120
<20-3,SAMPSON>他前几天来找我  借这些东西
<20-3,SAMPSON>He came to me a couple days ago, asking to borrow them.

565
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,580
<20-4,BECKETT>他有没有说要用它们做什么
<20-4,BECKETT>Did he say what he needed them for?

566
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:38,790
<20-5,SAMPSON>有时他会多给我一些钱
<20-5,SAMPSON>Sometimes he would slip me some extra cash

567
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:40,330
<20-5,SAMPSON>就是让我别多管闲事
<20-5,SAMPSON>not to ask questions.

568
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,080
<20-6,CASTLE>你还帮过他什么别的事吗
<20-6,CASTLE>Anything else you helped him with?

569
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,910
<20-7,SAMPSON>是的  他问了我一些警报电路图的事
<20-7,SAMPSON>Yeah -- he had some questions about alarm schematics.

570
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:46,950
<20-8,BECKETT>就像
<20-8,BECKETT>Like...

571
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:48,440
<20-8,BECKETT>就像是这种的吗
<20-8,BECKETT>like these?

572
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:50,620
<20-9,SAMPSON>是的
<20-9,SAMPSON>Yeah.

573
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,010
<20-10,CASTLE>那氯仿呢  桑普森先生
<20-10,CASTLE>What about chloroform, Mr. Sampson?

574
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:54,140
<20-10,CASTLE>也是你给他的吗
<20-10,CASTLE>Did you give him that, too?

575
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:56,130
<20-11,SAMPSON>不是  他有氯仿
<20-11,SAMPSON>No. He had chloroform?

576
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,710
<20-12,BECKETT>是的  怎么了  怎么回事
<20-12,BECKETT>Yeah. Why? What's wrong?

577
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,210
<20-13,SAMPSON>我给他夜视镜的时候
<20-13,SAMPSON>When I gave him the goggles,

578
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:01,150
<20-13,SAMPSON>问他还需不需要什么别的东西
<20-13,SAMPSON>I asked if there was anything else he needed.

579
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:02,500
<20-13,SAMPSON>他说了一些话
<20-13,SAMPSON>He said something.

580
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:04,600
<20-13,SAMPSON>我以为他是在开玩笑
<20-13,SAMPSON>I thought he was joking.

581
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:05,560
<20-14,CASTLE>他说什么了
<20-14,CASTLE>What did he say?

582
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:06,990
<20-15,SAMPSON>我问我
<20-15,SAMPSON>He asked me...

583
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,160
<20-15,SAMPSON>"处理尸体的最好办法是什么"
<20-15,SAMPSON>"What's the best way to get rid of a body?"

584
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,650
<21-1,CASTLE>"处理尸体"
<21-1,CASTLE>"Get rid of a body"?

585
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:17,170
<21-2,BECKETT>我现在开始认为这位律师
<21-2,BECKETT>I'm starting to think that our lawyer for the little guy

586
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:18,370
<21-2,BECKETT>真的绑架了人
<21-2,BECKETT>did abduct someone.

587
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:19,760
<21-3,CASTLE>是的  而且还杀了人
<21-3,CASTLE>Yeah, and apparently killed them.

588
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,740
<21-4,BECKETT>或许这就是他所说的"结算债务"
<21-4,BECKETT>Maybe that's what he meant by "Settling a debt."

589
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,900
<21-5,CASTLE>可债务是指什么  他杀了谁
<21-5,CASTLE>But what was the debt, whom did he kill,

590
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,020
<21-5,CASTLE>还有他怎么会把命搭上
<21-5,CASTLE>and how did it cost him his life?

591
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,600
<21-6,BECKETT>我们得去问问莱恩和埃斯波
<21-6,BECKETT>We need to check where Ryan and Espo are

592
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,780
<21-6,BECKETT>那份失踪人员名单查得怎么样了
<21-6,BECKETT>with that missing-persons list.

593
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,950
<21-6,BECKETT>如果我们能找到里奇
<21-6,BECKETT>If we can find a connection between Richie

594
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:31,180
<21-6,BECKETT>和名单上人的关系
<21-6,BECKETT>and one of the people on the list,

595
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,780
<21-6,BECKETT>我们就能有答案了
<21-6,BECKETT>that should give us some answers.

596
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:36,460
<21-7,BECKETT>话说莱恩和埃斯波去哪了
<21-7,BECKETT>Where are Ryan and Espo, anyway?

597
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,620
<21-8,GATES>我好像看到他们去审讯室了
<21-8,GATES>I think I saw them go into interrogation.

598
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,250
<21-9,CASTLE>他们在审讯谁
<21-9,CASTLE>Who are they interrogating?

599
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:45,580
<22-1,BECKETT>有什么我们不知道的嫌犯吗
<22-1,BECKETT>Hey, is there another suspect that we don't know about?

600
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,600
<22-1,BECKETT>怎么回事
<22-1,BECKETT>What's going on?

601
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,090
<22-2,OFFICER JENKINS>我不能说
<22-2,OFFICER JENKINS>I'm... not supposed to say.

602
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:49,120
<22-2,OFFICER JENKINS>我
<22-2,OFFICER JENKINS>I --

603
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,970
<22-3,OFFICER JENKINS>也不能让别人进去
<22-3,OFFICER JENKINS>Or let anyone in.

604
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:53,270
<22-3,OFFICER JENKINS>好吧
<22-3,OFFICER JENKINS>Okay.

605
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:05,210
<23-1,CASTLE>他们在干什么
<23-1,CASTLE>What are they doing?

606
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,880
<23-2,BECKETT>没搞错吧
<23-2,BECKETT>Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

607
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:21,000
<23-3,CASTLE>狗屁扭伤了
<23-3,CASTLE>"Sprained," my ass!

608
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:22,500
<23-3,CASTLE>他的膝盖明明没事
<23-3,CASTLE>His knee is fine.

609
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,630
<23-3,CASTLE>蠢朋克的《真走运》
<23-3,CASTLE>Daft Punk, "Get lucky."

610
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:27,280
<23-3,CASTLE>我打赌他们肯定把歌词改成"你有罪"了
<23-3,CASTLE>I bet they're changing the lyrics to "You're guilty."

611
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,650
<23-3,CASTLE>太棒了
<23-3,CASTLE>That's good!

612
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:33,540
<23-4,BECKETT>卡塞尔  他骗我们是为了让你跟他打赌
<23-4,BECKETT>Castle, he lied to us just so he could sucker you into a bet,

613
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,830
<23-4,BECKETT>你上当了
<23-4,BECKETT>which you fell for.

614
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:39,050
<23-5,CASTLE>他会后悔的
<23-5,CASTLE>He's gonna regret this.

615
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:40,680
<23-5,CASTLE>我们必须要赢
<23-5,CASTLE>Now we have to win.

616
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:42,860
<23-6,BECKETT>靠什么  我们冲澡时的表演吗
<23-6,BECKETT>With what -- our shower routine?

617
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,510
<23-7,TORY ELLIS>两位  有空吗
<23-7,TORY ELLIS>Hey, guys. Got a sec?

618
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:49,740
<23-7,TORY ELLIS>我好像查到些什么
<23-7,TORY ELLIS>I think I've got something.

619
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,290
<24-1,TORY>我之前一直没能把那份名单
<24-1,TORY>I haven't had any luck connecting that list

620
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:54,910
<24-1,TORY>和你给我的日期以及城市联系起来
<24-1,TORY>of dates and cities you gave me,

621
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:57,370
<24-1,TORY>但是当我追踪里奇昨天跟他的前任通话时
<24-1,TORY>But when I traced Richie's call to his ex yesterday,

622
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:59,470
<24-1,TORY>我发现了点有意思的事
<24-1,TORY>I did find something interesting.

623
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:00,990
<24-1,TORY>电话是从哈德逊克罗顿附近的
<24-1,TORY>Turns out it pinged off a cell tower

624
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,670
<24-1,TORY>信号塔拨出的
<24-1,TORY>near Croton-on-Hudson.

625
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:04,330
<24-2,CASTLE>那里离城市北部有一个小时
<24-2,CASTLE>That's an hour north of the city.

626
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:05,400
<24-2,CASTLE>里奇去哪干什么
<24-2,CASTLE>What was Richie doing up there?

627
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,670
<24-3,TORY>不知道  但是通过利用附近信号塔
<24-3,TORY>I don't know, but by triangulating the signal

628
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:09,160
<24-3,TORY>进行三角定位
<24-3,TORY>off of other nearby cell towers,

630
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,890
<24-3,TORY>我找到了一个很精确的区域
<24-3,TORY>I was able to dial in a more precise location.

631
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,680
<24-4,BECKETT>蒙特罗斯国家森林
<24-4,BECKETT>Montrose State Forest?

632
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:17,100
<24-5,TORY>更准确地说  那通电话是从这个停车场打出的
<24-5,TORY>To be exact, the call came from this parking lot,

633
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:20,120
<24-5,TORY>就在通往一大片森林的小道起点
<24-5,TORY>right at a trailhead into this large wooded area.

634
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:24,290
<24-6,CASTLE>一片很偏僻  位于正北方的森林
<24-6,CASTLE>An out-of-the-way forest well north of the city.

635
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:26,640
<24-6,CASTLE>你是不是也觉得这是...
<24-6,CASTLE>Now, is it just me, or does that sound like...

636
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,050
<24-7,BECKETT>处理尸体的最佳地点
<24-7,BECKETT>The perfect place to get rid of a body.

637
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,410
<25-1,BECKETT>你知道这个希望不大  对吧
<25-1,BECKETT>You know this is a long shot, right?

638
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:38,720
<25-2,CASTLE>如果就像托瑞说的  里奇把车停在那
<25-2,CASTLE>If Richie parked in the lot, like Tory said,

639
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:40,930
<25-2,CASTLE>那他就会沿着路走到这
<25-2,CASTLE>then he would have come down this trail right here.

640
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:43,390
<25-2,CASTLE>考虑到拖着一具尸体走不远
<25-2,CASTLE>And given how unwieldy it is to carry a dead body --

641
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:46,600
<25-2,CASTLE>这是研究的结果  不是我的经验
<25-2,CASTLE>that's research, not experience --

642
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:50,350
<25-2,CASTLE>那他不会走太远就会将其埋掉
<25-2,CASTLE>Well, then he wouldn't have gone very far before burying it,

643
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:53,750
<25-2,CASTLE>所以我们只需要在这一大片区域内
<25-2,CASTLE>which means we just have to look for freshly disturbed dirt

644
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:57,130
<25-2,CASTLE>找最近被翻动过的泥土
<25-2,CASTLE>in this, you know, general area...

645
00:23:57,930 --> 00:23:58,930
<25-2,CASTLE>比如  就是这里
<25-2,CASTLE>Like, right here.

646
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:00,520
<25-3,BECKETT>是的  我刚才说了  希望不大
<25-3,BECKETT>Yeah. Like I said, long shot.

647
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,440
<25-3,BECKETT>就像我们能赢的概率
<25-3,BECKETT>Just like our chances at winning that competition.

648
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:03,920
<25-4,CASTLE>别这么消极
<25-4,CASTLE>Don't think like that. Come on.

649
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,780
<25-4,CASTLE>我的搭档要有积极的态度
<25-4,CASTLE>I need my partner to have a positive attitude.

650
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,360
<25-5,BECKETT>是的  或许你应该在选搭档之前
<25-5,BECKETT>Yeah, then maybe you should have checked with your partner

651
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,180
<25-5,BECKETT>跟搭档商量一下
<25-5,BECKETT>before signing her up for this.

652
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:11,760
<25-6,CASTLE>有什么大不了  会很有趣的
<25-6,CASTLE>What's the big deal? It'll be fun!

653
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,890
<25-7,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你没见过那帮傻瓜吗
<25-7,BECKETT>Castle, did you see those knuckleheads?

654
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,970
<25-7,BECKETT>如果我有一天成为了
<25-7,BECKETT>I mean, what if I want to be a captain one day

655
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:17,540
<25-7,BECKETT>我们警区的警监
<25-7,BECKETT>of my own precinct?

656
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,990
<25-7,BECKETT>我希望他们能严肃对待我
<25-7,BECKETT>I kind of need people to take me seriously.

657
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:21,860
<25-8,CASTLE>是这样的  相信我
<25-8,CASTLE>They do. Trust me.

658
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:22,950
<25-9,BECKETT>而且我希望能一直这样下去
<25-9,BECKETT>And I'd like to keep it that way,

659
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:25,250
<25-9,BECKETT>如果我在整个警局的人面前像傻子一样表演
<25-9,BECKETT>which won't be possible if I'm acting like an idiot

660
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:26,970
<25-9,BECKETT>那是肯定不可能的
<25-9,BECKETT>in front of the entire police force.

661
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:28,220
<25-10,CASTLE>那这样行不行
<25-10,CASTLE>Okay. How about this?

662
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:31,590
<25-10,CASTLE>我们做一些简单  不失尊严又优雅的事
<25-10,CASTLE>We do something simple, dignified, elegant.

663
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:32,760
<25-10,CASTLE>比如...
<25-10,CASTLE>Something like...

664
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,070
<25-10,CASTLE>一片款冬花
<25-10,CASTLE>A patch of tussilago.

665
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:35,650
<25-11,BECKETT>-我没听说过  -不是  不是
<25-11,BECKETT>- I don't know that one. - No, no.

666
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:38,070
<25-12,CASTLE>记不记得蕾妮说里奇的裤子上
<25-12,CASTLE>Remember Lanie said that there was yellow pollen

667
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,790
<25-12,CASTLE>有一些款冬花的花粉
<25-12,CASTLE>on Richie's pants from a tussilago flower?

668
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:43,120
<25-12,CASTLE>看看这一片黄色的花
<25-12,CASTLE>Check out this little yellow patch right here

669
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,390
<25-12,CASTLE>大约到脚踝的高度
<25-12,CASTLE>about ankle high.

671
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:47,430
<25-12,CASTLE>在
<25-12,CASTLE>Yeah.

672
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:55,660
<25-12,CASTLE>里奇真的把人埋在这里
<25-12,CASTLE>Richie did bury someone out here.

673
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:02,150
<26-1,CASTLE>关于那件事
<26-1,CASTLE>Look, about the routine...

674
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:03,620
<26-1,CASTLE>我知道你在担心  不过
<26-1,CASTLE>I know you're worried, but --

675
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:06,410
<26-2,BECKETT>没事的  卡塞尔  我们做什么没关系
<26-2,BECKETT>It's okay, Castle. It doesn't matter what we do.

676
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:07,730
<26-3,CASTLE>就要这种精神
<26-3,CASTLE>Hey, that's the spirit!

677
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,120
<26-4,BECKETT>最后都会以悲剧收场
<26-4,BECKETT>It's gonna be a disaster.

678
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:10,470
<26-5,CASTLE>不要这种精神
<26-5,CASTLE>That's not the spirit.

679
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:14,440
<26-6,BECKETT>我可能会被绊倒  衣服可能会滑落
<26-6,BECKETT>I'm probably gonna trip, my dress is gonna split,

680
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,710
<26-6,BECKETT>视频会被疯传
<26-6,BECKETT>video's gonna go viral.

681
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,630
<26-7,CASTLE>你现在有点多虑了
<26-7,CASTLE>Okay, now you're just sounding paranoid.

682
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:19,050
<26-7,CASTLE>怎么会有这种想法
<26-7,CASTLE>Where is this coming from?

683
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,380
<26-8,BECKETT>我的意思是  卡塞尔  这都有可能发生
<26-8,BECKETT>I'm just saying, Castle, it could happen.

684
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,060
<26-8,BECKETT>盖茨警监不上台表演
<26-8,BECKETT>I mean, there's a reason why Captain Gates

685
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,910
<26-8,BECKETT>是有她的道理的
<26-8,BECKETT>doesn't get up on the stage and have fun.

686
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,220
<26-9,CASTLE>我一直都以为
<26-9,CASTLE>I just always assumed

687
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,980
<26-9,CASTLE>她是真的做不到
<26-9,CASTLE>it was because she was genetically incapable of it.

688
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:30,020
<26-9,CASTLE>你想让我取消吗
<26-9,CASTLE>You want me to cancel?

689
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,380
<26-10,BECKETT>不  不
<26-10,BECKETT>No! No.

690
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,900
<26-10,BECKETT>这样也会让我丢脸的
<26-10,BECKETT>That would just make me lose face in another way.

691
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:36,320
<26-11,BECKETT>我碰到了什么东西
<26-11,BECKETT>I just hit something.

692
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:41,720
<26-12,CASTLE>是尸体袋
<26-12,CASTLE>That's a body bag.

693
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:01,820
<26-13,GUNMAN>把袋子放下  离尸体远一些
<26-13,GUNMAN>Put the bag down and step away from the body.

694
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,520
<26-14,CASTLE>我想我们刚给自己挖好了坟墓
<26-14,CASTLE>I think we may just have dug our own graves.

695
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,250
<27-1,CASTLE>我什么都没听见
<27-1,CASTLE>I don't hear anything.

696
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:15,570
<27-2,BECKETT>我也是
<27-2,BECKETT>Me neither.

697
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,460
<27-3,CASTLE>他在干什么
<27-3,CASTLE>What's he doing?

698
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:23,760
<27-4,BECKETT>他走了
<27-4,BECKETT>He's gone.

699
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:24,830
<27-4,BECKETT>什么
<27-4,BECKETT>What?

700
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:29,300
<28-1,RYAN>尸体也不见了  他把尸体偷走了
<28-1,RYAN>So's the body! He stole the body.

701
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,420
<27-6,CASTLE>为什么会有人来偷尸体
<27-6,CASTLE>Why would anyone steal a body?

702
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:32,090
<27-7,BECKETT>他肯定跟这个案子有所关联
<27-7,BECKETT>He must be connected to this somehow.

703
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:33,360
<27-8,CASTLE>也许他跟里奇是一伙的
<27-8,CASTLE>Maybe he and Richie are partners.

704
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,360
<27-8,CASTLE>或许是他们一起杀那个人
<27-8,CASTLE>Maybe they killed that person together.

705
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,060
<27-9,BECKETT>之后会有时间来讨论这个的
<27-9,BECKETT>Well, there'll be time for questions later.

706
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,300
<27-9,BECKETT>现在我们得找个法子
<27-9,BECKETT>Right now, we just have to find a way

707
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,450
<27-9,BECKETT>在他回来前把束线带割断
<27-9,BECKETT>to saw through these zip tie before he gets back.

708
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:42,280
<27-10,CASTLE>他把我们的钥匙和手机拿走了  所以
<27-10,CASTLE>Yes, well, he took our keys and our phones, so...

709
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,720
<27-10,CASTLE>等等
<27-10,CASTLE>Oh! Wait a minute.

710
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:45,880
<27-10,CASTLE>作为私家侦探培训的一部分  我看了
<27-10,CASTLE>As part of my P.I. training, I saw a video

711
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,840
<27-10,CASTLE>怎么把束线手铐弄断的视频
<27-10,CASTLE>on how to break these zip-tie cuffs.

712
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,150
<27-10,CASTLE>你只需要拿它们
<27-10,CASTLE>All you have to do is just hit them

713
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:51,280
<27-10,CASTLE>用尽全力砸自己的屁股
<27-10,CASTLE>as hard as you can against your ass!

714
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:53,910
<27-10,CASTLE>视频上说可能需要多尝试几次
<27-10,CASTLE>It said it might take a few tries.

715
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,390
<27-11,BECKETT>-没有用  -不会的
<27-11,BECKETT>- It's not working. - No.

716
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:06,430
<27-13,BECKETT>但往好的方面想  我觉得
<27-13,BECKETT>But on the bright side, I think

717
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:08,470
<27-14,CASTLE>我们想到了几个新的舞蹈动作
<27-14,CASTLE>we came up with a new move for our dance routine.

718
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,590
<27-14,CASTLE>玩笑开得太早
<27-14,CASTLE>Too soon?

719
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,500
<27-16,BECKETT>好了
<27-16,BECKETT>Yes! Oh!

720
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,390
<27-17,CASTLE>太好了
<27-17,CASTLE>Sweet.

721
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,580
<28-1,RYAN>他把尸体偷走了吗
<28-1,RYAN>He stole the body?

722
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:23,220
<28-2,BECKETT>派一队人到那片林子去看有没有蛛丝马迹
<28-2,BECKETT>Send a team up to those woods to comb for trace evidence

723
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:25,950
<28-2,BECKETT>查一下这些束线带上的DNA
<28-2,BECKETT>and check these zip ties for DNA.

724
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:26,940
<28-3,RYAN>你们看到了那个人吗
<28-3,RYAN>Did you get a look at this guy?

725
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,490
<28-4,CASTLE>他戴了面具而且出现在我们后面
<28-4,CASTLE>He was masked, came up behind us,

726
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:30,280
<28-4,CASTLE>一直没有在我们面前露脸
<28-4,CASTLE>kept us facing away from him the whole time.

727
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:31,590
<28-5,BECKETT>从失踪人口上有查到什么吗
<28-5,BECKETT>Anything from missing persons?

728
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,430
<28-5,BECKETT>里奇的生活中有人失踪吗
<28-5,BECKETT>Anyone in Richie's life that disappeared?

729
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:36,100
<28-6,RYAN>我们查了三州地区
<28-6,RYAN>Well, we've looked into every disappearance and break-in

730
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,310
<28-6,RYAN>所有的失踪和非法闯入的案件
<28-6,RYAN>in the tri-state area.

731
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:39,690
<28-6,RYAN>目前还没有发现他们和里奇间的关联
<28-6,RYAN>So far, no connection to any one of them and Richie.

732
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:42,720
<28-7,ESPOSITO>我查了他已知的合伙人  客户
<28-7,ESPOSITO>And I, uh, checked with known associates, clients,

733
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,090
<28-7,ESPOSITO>还有他告过的人
<28-7,ESPOSITO>people he was suing.

734
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:45,060
<28-7,ESPOSITO>他们都没有失踪
<28-7,ESPOSITO>They're all accounted for.

735
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:47,770
<28-8,BECKETT>确实有人在运尸袋里  再深入调查一下
<28-8,BECKETT>Yeah. Well, somebody was in that bag, so let's dig deeper.

736
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:52,420
<28-9,CASTLE>你可以不用装瘸了
<28-9,CASTLE>Oh. And, uh, you can lose the limp.

737
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:53,920
<28-9,CASTLE>我们看到你们排练了
<28-9,CASTLE>We saw you rehearsing.

738
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:57,810
<28-9,CASTLE>再补充一点  不再是今生之罪了
<28-9,CASTLE>If I might add, it's no "I've had the crime of my life."

739
00:27:57,890 --> 00:27:58,700
<28-9,CASTLE>那么
<28-9,CASTLE>Well...

740
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:01,600
<28-10,ESPOSITO>能赢你们俩还是挺好的
<28-10,ESPOSITO>It's still good enough to take the both of you down.

741
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:02,620
<28-10,ESPOSITO>算了吧  伙计们
<28-10,ESPOSITO>Come on, guys.

742
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:04,110
<28-11,BECKETT>比赛不是最重要的
<28-11,BECKETT>This isn't really about the competition.

743
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,630
<28-11,BECKETT>都是为了慈善  不是吗
<28-11,BECKETT>It's about doing our best for a good cause, right?

744
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,910
<28-12,CASTLE>一切都是为了比赛
<28-12,CASTLE>It's about the competition.

745
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:21,770
<29-1,MARTHA RODGERS>真棒  太棒了
<29-1,MARTHA RODGERS>Well! Bravo! And brava!

746
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:23,510
<29-1,MARTHA RODGERS>太棒了  亲爱的太精彩了
<29-1,MARTHA RODGERS>Wonderful. Darlings, just wonderful.

747
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:24,380
<29-2,BECKETT>谢谢
<29-2,BECKETT>Thank you.

748
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:25,580
<29-3,CASTLE>你之前还担心呢  看到了吧
<29-3,CASTLE>And you were worried. See?

749
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:27,080
<29-3,CASTLE>这既优雅又高贵
<29-3,CASTLE>It's elegant, dignified,

750
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:29,480
<29-3,CASTLE>最重要的是  这是要赢得奖杯的表演
<29-3,CASTLE>and, above all, a trophy-winning performance.

751
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,400
<29-3,CASTLE>我说的对吗  妈妈
<29-3,CASTLE>Am I right, mother?

752
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,240
<29-4,MARTHA>会是的  等我帮你们排练好
<29-4,MARTHA>Well, it will be when I'm done with it.

753
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,790
<29-5,CASTLE>我要稍稍调整一些细节
<29-5,CASTLE>I'm gonna just need to tweak a few little things.

754
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:35,900
<29-6,MARTHA>我真的很希望你们能做那个劈叉
<29-6,MARTHA>And I do wish you would go for that split.

755
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,770
<29-7,CASTLE>-可我  -我要留你来说服她
<29-7,CASTLE>- Well, I -- - Okay. Well, I will leave you to convince Ginger.

756
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:39,780
<29-7,CASTLE>我很快就回来
<29-7,CASTLE>I will be right back.

757
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:40,810
<29-8,BECKETT>等等  你要去哪里
<29-8,BECKETT>Wait. Where -- w-where are you going?

758
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:41,660
<29-9,CASTLE>我要给埃斯波西托打电话
<29-9,CASTLE>I'm gonna call Esposito.

759
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:43,740
<29-9,CASTLE>我觉得是时候增加赌注了
<29-9,CASTLE>I think it's time we raise the stakes on that bet.

760
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,140
<29-10,BECKETT>什么  卡塞尔
<29-10,BECKETT>What? Castle...

761
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:50,010
<29-11,MARTHA>亲爱的  别担心他了
<29-11,MARTHA>Oh, darling, don't you worry about him.

762
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:51,970
<29-11,MARTHA>不要担心奖杯
<29-11,MARTHA>Do not worry about that trophy,

763
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:53,620
<29-11,MARTHA>因为在最后的表演中
<29-11,MARTHA>because the only thing that anybody

764
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:56,390
<29-11,MARTHA>大家唯一会记住的
<29-11,MARTHA>is going to remember from the final performance

765
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:58,580
<29-11,MARTHA>就是你像天使一样歌唱
<29-11,MARTHA>is that you sound like an angel.

766
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:00,940
<29-12,BECKETT>玛莎  我做不到
<29-12,BECKETT>Except, Martha, I won't.

767
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:03,430
<29-13,MARTHA>你当然可以  你刚刚就做到了
<29-13,MARTHA>Well, of course you will. You just did.

768
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:07,270
<29-14,BECKETT>不  玛莎  那是因为只有你和理查德
<29-14,BECKETT>No, Martha. That's because it was just you and Rick.

769
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:09,810
<29-14,BECKETT>我们没有公开地在陌生人面前
<29-14,BECKETT>We weren't in public in front of strangers.

770
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:11,830
<29-15,MARTHA>不会吧  舞台恐惧
<29-15,MARTHA>Oh, no. Stage fright.

771
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:14,230
<29-16,BECKETT>更像是唱歌恐惧
<29-16,BECKETT>Well, it's -- it's -- it's more like song fright.

772
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:15,900
<29-16,BECKETT>我是说  我的心会跳得很快
<29-16,BECKETT>I mean, my heart just starts palpitating

773
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,540
<29-16,BECKETT>并且冒汗  我的喉咙就像堵住了一样
<29-16,BECKETT>and I start sweating and my throat just chokes up.

774
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:19,040
<29-17,MARTHA>我懂  我明白
<29-17,MARTHA>I know. I know. I know.

775
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,840
<29-17,MARTHA>这很正常  确实很糟糕
<29-17,MARTHA>It's classic, and it's awful.

776
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:21,900
<29-17,MARTHA>那为什么
<29-17,MARTHA>And why in the world

777
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:23,730
<29-17,MARTHA>理查德会让你参加呢
<29-17,MARTHA>would Richard sign you up for this?

778
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,860
<29-18,BECKETT>他不知道
<29-18,BECKETT>He doesn't know.

779
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:30,620
<29-19,MARTHA>宝贝  你得告诉他
<29-19,MARTHA>Oh, honey. You have to tell him.

780
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,360
<29-20,BECKETT>我不想让他失望
<29-20,BECKETT>Oh, I-I don't want to let him down.

781
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,670
<29-20,BECKETT>他太想参加了
<29-20,BECKETT>He wants this so badly.

782
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:34,780
<29-20,BECKETT>我想帮他
<29-20,BECKETT>I want to give it to him.

783
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:37,430
<29-20,BECKETT>但我只是  我不知道我能不能
<29-20,BECKETT>But I just -- I don't know that I can.

784
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:42,740
<30-1,CASTLE>我已经等不及看他们脸上的表情
<30-1,CASTLE>I cannot wait to see the looks on their faces

785
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,220
<30-1,CASTLE>当他们看了我们的表演之后
<30-1,CASTLE>when they get a load of our routine.

786
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:46,370
<30-2,BECKETT>我可以很清楚地想象到
<30-2,BECKETT>Yeah, I can imagine it v-vividly.

787
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:47,960
<30-3,CASTLE>相信我  肯定很棒
<30-3,CASTLE>Oh, trust me -- it'll be great.

788
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:50,100
<30-4,ESPOSITO>如果真的会很棒的话
<30-4,ESPOSITO>If it's gonna be so great,

789
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,990
<30-4,ESPOSITO>为什么我们不把赌注再加大一点
<30-4,ESPOSITO>then why don't we up the bet again?

790
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:54,770
<30-5,CASTLE>埃斯波西托  你有什么想法
<30-5,CASTLE>Well, Esposito, what did you have in mind?

791
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:56,770
<30-6,GATES>抱歉各位  什么打赌都没了
<30-6,GATES>Sorry, fellas. All bets are off.

792
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:58,660
<30-6,GATES>刚得到总局的消息
<30-6,GATES>I just heard from 1pp.

793
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:01,580
<30-6,GATES>坎莫尔重新安排了他的日程  他回来了
<30-6,GATES>Kimmel rearranged his schedule, and he's back in.

794
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,220
<30-6,GATES>所以  不幸的是
<30-6,GATES>Oh -- so, unfortunately,

795
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,600
<30-6,GATES>卡塞尔先生  我们不需要麻烦你了
<30-6,GATES>we will not be needing your services, Mr. Castle.

796
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,640
<30-7,BECKETT>真的吗
<30-7,BECKETT>Really?

797
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,130
<30-8,CASTLE>可我们都排练好了
<30-8,CASTLE>But we rehearsed and everything.

798
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,210
<30-9,GATES>这我可管不了
<30-9,GATES>Out of my hands.

799
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:12,950
<30-10,CASTLE>这没完
<30-10,CASTLE>This isn't over.

800
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:15,490
<30-11,RYAN>-伙计们  我们找到他了  -谁
<30-11,RYAN>- Hey, guys. We got him. - Who?

801
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:17,600
<30-12,BECKETT>那个在树林里从你们手上抢走尸体的人
<30-12,BECKETT>That guy who jacked you for that body in the woods.

802
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,680
<30-13,RYAN>当鉴证组赶到那时
<30-13,RYAN>When CSU went up there,

803
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:20,200
<30-13,RYAN>他们在树上发现了些东西
<30-13,RYAN>they noticed something in the trees --

804
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,180
<30-13,RYAN>由运用传感器触发的摄像头
<30-13,RYAN>Cameras triggered by motion sensors

805
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:24,220
<30-13,RYAN>来统计野生生物的数量
<30-13,RYAN>to carry out wildlife census.

806
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:26,170
<30-13,RYAN>猜我们找到了什么野生生物
<30-13,RYAN>Guess what kind of wildlife we found.

807
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:29,660
<30-14,BECKETT>麦克·桑普森
<30-14,BECKETT>Mike Sampson.

808
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:30,760
<30-14,BECKETT>里奇的私家侦探
<30-14,BECKETT>Richie's P.I.

809
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:38,550
<31-1,RYAN>纽约警局
<31-1,RYAN>NYPD!

810
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:39,870
<31-2,ESPOSITO>让我看到你的双手  现在
<31-2,ESPOSITO>Let me see your hands -- now!

811
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:44,900
<31-3,BECKETT>麦克  尸体在哪
<31-3,BECKETT>Where is it, Mike? Where's the body?

812
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,360
<31-4,SAMPSON>怎么了  你们在说什么
<31-4,SAMPSON>What's going on? What are you talking about?

813
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:47,610
<31-5,BECKETT>搜查他的住处
<31-5,BECKETT>Search his place.

814
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,100
<31-5,BECKETT>埃斯波  打开后备箱
<31-5,BECKETT>Espo, pop the trunk.

815
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:50,090
<31-6,ESPOSITO>把手放在车上
<31-6,ESPOSITO>Hands on the car.

816
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:55,010
<31-6,ESPOSITO>好吧
<31-6,ESPOSITO>All right.

817
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,190
<31-7,CASTLE>在这
<31-7,CASTLE>It's here.

818
00:30:57,450 --> 00:30:58,600
<31-8,BECKETT>麦克  运尸袋里的是谁
<31-8,BECKETT>Who's in the bag, Mike?

819
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:10,940
<31-9,CASTLE>什么啊这是
<31-9,CASTLE>What the...

820
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:22,430
<32-1,BECKETT>关于里奇和假人  桑普森都不愿意谈
<32-1,BECKETT>Sampson's not talking -- about Richie or the dummy.

821
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:23,500
<32-1,BECKETT>我不明白
<32-1,BECKETT>I don't get it.

822
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:25,390
<32-2,CASTLE>为什么里奇把做撞击试验的假人
<32-2,CASTLE>Why would Richie bury a crash-test dummy

823
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:27,450
<32-2,CASTLE>埋在偏僻的地方  为什么桑普森要偷走它
<32-2,CASTLE>in the middle of nowhere, and why would Sampson steal it?

824
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:30,030
<32-3,BECKETT>我不知道  但他有可能故意
<32-3,BECKETT>I don't know, but he probably told us that story

825
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:31,260
<32-3,BECKETT>告诉我们里奇抛尸的故事
<32-3,BECKETT>about Richie dumping a body

826
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:33,130
<32-3,BECKETT>这样我们就能带他找到它
<32-3,BECKETT>so that we could lead him straight to it.

827
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:34,960
<32-4,RYAN>事实证明假人并不是
<32-4,RYAN>Well, it turns out that dummy's not the only thing

828
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,320
<32-4,RYAN>桑普森偷走的唯一东西
<32-4,RYAN>that Sampson stole.

829
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,390
<32-4,RYAN>警员在他的公寓发现了里奇丢失的客户资料
<32-4,RYAN>UNIs found Richies's missing client files

830
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:40,490
<32-4,RYAN>并且都被撕毁了
<32-4,RYAN>in his apartment, shredded.

831
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:43,470
<32-5,BECKETT>这肯定和里奇的某个案子有关
<32-5,BECKETT>This must have something to do with one of Richie's cases.

832
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:44,540
<32-6,RYAN>但是哪一个呢
<32-6,RYAN>Yeah, but which one?

833
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,930
<32-7,BECKETT>你知道吗  如果桑普森不愿说
<32-7,BECKETT>You know, if Sampson won't talk,

834
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:48,480
<32-7,BECKETT>也许那个假人会告诉我们
<32-7,BECKETT>then maybe the dummy will.

835
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:51,800
<33-1,LANIE>你知道我是医生  不是傀儡师对吧
<33-1,LANIE>You do know I'm a doctor, not a puppeteer?

836
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,410
<33-2,BECKETT>对呀  因为你是医生  我才希望你能
<33-2,BECKETT>Yes. And as a doctor, I was hoping that you could tell us

837
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:56,970
<33-2,BECKETT>告诉我们这假人有什么特别之处
<33-2,BECKETT>what's so special about this dummy.

838
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:59,330
<33-3,LANIE>我可以告诉你们它的特别之处
<33-3,LANIE>I'll tell you what's special about it.

839
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,750
<33-3,LANIE>这假人被谋杀了
<33-3,LANIE>This dummy has been murdered.

840
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:02,820
<33-4,CASTLE>谋杀
<33-4,CASTLE>Murdered?

841
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,160
<33-5,LANIE>看到它胸口的小孔了吗
<33-5,LANIE>See the holes in his chest?

842
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,780
<33-6,CASTLE>看起来像很小的弹孔
<33-6,CASTLE>They look like little bullet holes.

843
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:07,310
<33-7,LANIE>也可以算是了
<33-7,LANIE>That's basically what they are.

844
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:09,730
<33-7,LANIE>就我所见  成因是有巨大外力推动的
<33-7,LANIE>As far as I can tell, they were made by small metal pieces

845
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:11,850
<33-7,LANIE>小型金属片
<33-7,LANIE>projected with significant force.

846
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:13,050
<33-8,BECKETT>什么能导致这样的情况
<33-8,BECKETT>What would explain that?

847
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:13,820
<33-9,LANIE>很难说
<33-9,LANIE>It's hard to say.

848
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:15,570
<33-9,LANIE>这种假人用处广泛
<33-9,LANIE>Lots of people use these dummies --

849
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:18,490
<33-9,LANIE>汽车公司  航空公司
<33-9,LANIE>Car companies, the airline industry,

850
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:19,710
<33-9,LANIE>还有军队
<33-9,LANIE>the military.

851
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,850
<33-10,BECKETT>可能是某人用来检测爆炸物或者
<33-10,BECKETT>So someone could have been testing the effects

852
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:23,690
<33-10,BECKETT>新型枪械的效果的
<33-10,BECKETT>of an I.E.D. or a new firearm.

853
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:25,530
<33-11,CASTLE>我觉得不是枪械
<33-11,CASTLE>I don't think it's a firearm.

854
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,230
<33-11,CASTLE>三个孔
<33-11,CASTLE>Three holes...

855
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,750
<33-11,CASTLE>心脏周围有三片游离金属
<33-11,CASTLE>Three bits of flying metal around the heart.

856
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:32,810
<33-11,CASTLE>这话在哪里听过
<33-11,CASTLE>Where have we heard that before?

857
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,890
<33-12,BECKETT>巨锤的客户  斗牛犬想撬走的那位
<33-12,BECKETT>Hammer's client -- the one Pitbull tried to poach.

858
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:41,020
<34-1,JODY>我记得的最后一件事就是收旧货的卡车
<34-1,JODY>Last thing I remember was that salvage truck

859
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:42,710
<34-1,JODY>冲进了我面前的绿化带
<34-1,JODY>hitting the median before me.

860
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,830
<34-1,JODY>那是金属碎片就一通乱飞
<34-1,JODY>That's when the metal started to fly.

861
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:48,230
<34-1,JODY>救护人员说我很幸运  差点就没命了
<34-1,JODY>The paramedic said I was lucky, that I almost died.

862
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,650
<34-2,BECKETT>朱迪  你还记得这个人吗
<34-2,BECKETT>Um, Jody, do you remember this guy?

863
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,180
<34-2,BECKETT>记得  斗牛犬
<34-2,BECKETT>Yeah -- The Pitbull.

864
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:54,980
<34-3,JODY>他想为我代理  但我已经有律师了
<34-3,JODY>He wanted to represent me, but I already had a lawyer.

865
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:57,720
<34-3,JODY>然后他问了很多关于车祸的细节
<34-3,JODY>But then he wouldn't stop asking about the accident,

866
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,800
<34-3,JODY>一副不相信的样子
<34-3,JODY>like he didn't believe what happened.

867
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:01,990
<34-4,CASTLE>朱迪  你当时开的是什么车
<34-4,CASTLE>Jody, what kind of car were you driving?

868
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:04,200
<34-5,JODY>我不确定  车是租来的
<34-5,JODY>I'm not sure. It was a rental.

869
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:06,990
<34-5,JODY>怎么每个人都这么问我
<34-5,JODY>Why does everyone keep asking that?

870
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,180
<34-6,CASTLE>还有谁问了
<34-6,CASTLE>Who's been asking?

871
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:11,390
<34-7,JODY>斗牛犬  还有昨天那位女士
<34-7,JODY>The Pitbull and the lady who was here yesterday.

872
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:12,310
<34-8,BECKETT>哪位女士
<34-8,BECKETT>What lady?

873
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,940
<34-9,JODY>她说她是我保险公司的业务员
<34-9,JODY>She said she was from my insurance company.

874
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:16,960
<34-9,JODY>我醒的时候  她正在看我的病情表
<34-9,JODY>When I woke up, she was looking at my chart.

875
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,480
<34-9,JODY>她问了我的伤情
<34-9,JODY>She asked me about my injuries

876
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,640
<34-9,JODY>还问了很多车的事
<34-9,JODY>and wanted to know all about the car.

877
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,120
<34-10,CASTLE>讲不通
<34-10,CASTLE>That doesn't make any sense.

878
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,660
<34-10,CASTLE>这些信息保险公司都能从
<34-10,CASTLE>The insurance company would have that information

879
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:24,790
<34-10,CASTLE>车祸报告中找到
<34-10,CASTLE>from the accident report.

880
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:27,210
<34-11,BECKETT>你可以向画像师描述一下她的长相吗
<34-11,BECKETT>Do you think you could describe her to a sketch artist?

881
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:28,310
<34-12,JODY>可以
<34-12,JODY>Yeah.

882
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:30,050
<34-13,BECKETT>好的  还有件事
<34-13,BECKETT>Okay. And, um, one more thing.

883
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:32,260
<34-13,BECKETT>你租车的公司叫什么名字
<34-13,BECKETT>What was the name of the car-rental company?

884
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:33,820
<35-1,ESPOSITO>根据租车公司的信息
<35-1,ESPOSITO>According to the rental firm,

885
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:35,950
<35-1,ESPOSITO>朱迪开的是辆莫德斯托轿车
<35-1,ESPOSITO>Jody was driving a Modesto Sedan.

886
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,590
<35-1,ESPOSITO>我没有找到能解释她伤情的安全召回事件
<35-1,ESPOSITO>Now, I couldn't find any safety recalls to explain her injuries,

887
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:41,240
<35-1,ESPOSITO>凭直觉  我又查了找到的那张纸上
<35-1,ESPOSITO>but on a hunch, I checked the cities and dates

888
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,710
<35-1,ESPOSITO>列出的城市和时间
<35-1,ESPOSITO>on that slip of paper that we found.

889
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:44,400
<35-1,ESPOSITO>我发现每起
<35-1,ESPOSITO>Turns out that each one

890
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,400
<35-1,ESPOSITO>涉及莫德斯托的车祸
<35-1,ESPOSITO>corresponded to a Modesto car accident

891
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,650
<35-1,ESPOSITO>均出现了司机胸口受到刺伤的情况
<35-1,ESPOSITO>where the driver suffered puncture wounds to the chest.

892
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:50,920
<35-2,BECKETT>就像朱迪·埃文斯和撞击试验假人
<35-2,BECKETT>Just like Jody Evans and that crash-test dummy.

893
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,950
<35-3,ESPOSITO>但所有案子里  这伤口
<35-3,ESPOSITO>Yeah, but in each case, the wounds

894
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:54,910
<35-3,ESPOSITO>都被归为了外来因素
<35-3,ESPOSITO>were attributed to something outside the vehicle --

895
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:56,670
<35-3,ESPOSITO>马路上来的碎片  甚至还有枪伤的说法
<35-3,ESPOSITO>Road debris, even gunshots.

896
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:58,600
<35-4,BECKETT>根据碎片速度
<35-4,BECKETT>Given the velocity of the shrapnel,

897
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,750
<35-4,BECKETT>可以肯定这是气囊的缺陷导致的
<35-4,BECKETT>this must be related to a defect in the airbags.

898
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:03,320
<35-5,CASTLE>根据假人上的伤口
<35-5,CASTLE>And judging by the holes in that dummy,

899
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,060
<35-5,CASTLE>莫德斯托是知道此缺陷存在的
<35-5,CASTLE>Modesto was aware of that defect

900
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,720
<35-5,CASTLE>却选择了闭口不提
<35-5,CASTLE>and chose to sweep it under the rug.

901
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,340
<35-5,CASTLE>里奇发现了一个被掩盖的真相
<35-5,CASTLE>Richie was onto a cover-up.

902
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,830
<35-6,ESPOSITO>是啊  而且他很可能本来就知情
<35-6,ESPOSITO>Yeah, one that he might have been a part of.

903
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:11,480
<35-6,ESPOSITO>我查了里奇五年前就职的
<35-6,ESPOSITO>I looked into that big-time law firm

904
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,220
<35-6,ESPOSITO>那家有名的律师事务所
<35-6,ESPOSITO>where Richie used to work five years ago

905
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:14,380
<35-6,ESPOSITO>那是他还不是斗牛犬
<35-6,ESPOSITO>before he became the Pitbull.

906
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,920
<35-6,ESPOSITO>猜猜他们最大的客户是谁
<35-6,ESPOSITO>Guess who their biggest client was.

907
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:17,630
<35-7,BECKETT>莫德斯托汽车
<35-7,BECKETT>Modesto Motors.

908
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:19,630
<35-8,ESPOSITO>而且他们的案子都是里奇处理的
<35-8,ESPOSITO>Yeah. And Richie handled their account.

909
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:23,080
<35-9,CASTLE>大概五年前  莫德斯托差点破产了
<35-9,CASTLE>You know, about five years, Modesto was nearly bankrupt.

910
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:27,050
<35-10,BECKETT>所以它们没有选择花几百万来修复隐患
<35-10,BECKETT>So rather than spend millions of dollars to fix the problem,

911
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:29,180
<35-10,BECKETT>而是在召回的成本
<35-10,BECKETT>they decided that the cost of recall

912
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:31,430
<35-10,BECKETT>和人身安全之间  选择了前者
<35-10,BECKETT>outweighed the potential cost to human life.

913
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:33,280
<35-11,ESPOSITO>看来里奇良心上很过不去
<35-11,ESPOSITO>Looks like Richie's conscience couldn't take it.

914
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,190
<35-11,ESPOSITO>他染上酗酒和吸毒
<35-11,ESPOSITO>That problem he had with drinking and drugs

915
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,130
<35-11,ESPOSITO>都是第一起事件后几个月开始的
<35-11,ESPOSITO>started just a few months after that first accident.

916
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:39,500
<35-12,CASTLE>里奇跟里克说要还的债
<35-12,CASTLE>That debt Richie told Derek he was settling --

917
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,800
<35-12,CASTLE>指的是因果报应
<35-12,CASTLE>it was a karmic one.

918
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:43,370
<35-13,BECKETT>他想弥补这件事  揭露真相
<35-13,BECKETT>He wanted to make it right, expose the cover-up.

919
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:45,880
<35-14,CASTLE>他必须证明莫德斯托在有人因此丧命前
<35-14,CASTLE>He needed to prove that Modesto knew about the defect

920
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,660
<35-14,CASTLE>就知道缺陷的事
<35-14,CASTLE>even before people started dying.

921
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:50,700
<35-14,CASTLE>那个撞击试验假人  就是他的铁证
<35-14,CASTLE>That crash-test dummy -- that was his smoking gun.

922
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:52,680
<35-15,ESPOSITO>这也解释了撬门工具
<35-15,ESPOSITO>Which explains the break-in equipment.

923
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:54,820
<35-15,ESPOSITO>他需要从莫德斯托那把假人偷出来
<35-15,ESPOSITO>He needed it to steal the dummy from Modesto.

924
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:56,630
<35-16,BECKETT>怪不得里奇疑神疑鬼
<35-16,BECKETT>No wonder Richie was paranoid

925
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:58,560
<35-16,BECKETT>要把假人埋在森林
<35-16,BECKETT>and buried that dummy in the woods.

926
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:01,090
<35-16,BECKETT>如果缺陷的真相被揭穿
<35-16,BECKETT>Guys, if the truth about the defect came out,

927
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:02,230
<35-16,BECKETT>莫德斯托可能会
<35-16,BECKETT>then Modesto would be liable

928
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:04,550
<35-16,BECKETT>面临上亿的损失
<35-16,BECKETT>for hundreds of millions of dollars in damages.

929
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:06,420
<35-17,CASTLE>他知道他们会不顾一切的抢回假人
<35-17,CASTLE>He knew they'd stop at nothing to get it back.

930
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,150
<35-18,BECKETT>这理论很棒
<35-18,BECKETT>Okay, this is a hell of a theory,

931
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:11,300
<35-18,BECKETT>但现在里奇死了  文件也销毁了
<35-18,BECKETT>but with Richie dead, the files all destroyed,

932
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,570
<35-18,BECKETT>如果无法证明莫德斯托
<35-18,BECKETT>and with absolutely no connection

933
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:14,310
<35-18,BECKETT>和假人的联系
<35-18,BECKETT>between the dummy and modesto,

934
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:15,870
<35-18,BECKETT>那这些也就只是理论而已
<35-18,BECKETT>It's just that -- it's a theory.

935
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:17,300
<35-19,RYAN>可不只是个理论
<35-19,RYAN>Oh, it's more than a theory.

936
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,900
<35-19,RYAN>我们刚拿到根据朱迪的描述
<35-19,RYAN>We just got that sketch back from Jody

937
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,740
<35-19,RYAN>那位去看望她  自称是
<35-19,RYAN>of the woman who visited her

938
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:22,380
<35-19,RYAN>保险公司业务员的女人的素描图
<35-19,RYAN>claiming to be from an insurance company.

939
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:23,610
<35-19,RYAN>眼熟吗
<35-19,RYAN>Look familiar?

940
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,850
<35-19,RYAN>里奇的前妻
<35-19,RYAN>Richie's ex.

941
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,320
<35-20,ESPOSITO>她和这些事有什么关系啊
<35-20,ESPOSITO>What the hell does she have to do with any of this?

942
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,470
<35-21,RYAN>她刚刚被撬走  离开了和里奇曾一起工作的
<35-21,RYAN>She was recently poached from the law firm

943
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:32,230
<35-21,RYAN>那个律师事务所
<35-21,RYAN>that she and Richie worked at.

944
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:34,280
<35-21,RYAN>现在她是莫德斯托首席律师
<35-21,RYAN>She's now lead counsel for Modesto.

945
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,760
<35-22,CASTLE>里奇就成了威胁
<35-22,CASTLE>Richie was a threat.

946
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,830
<35-22,CASTLE>他知道那些人因何丧命
<35-22,CASTLE>He knew where the bodies were buried.

947
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:40,990
<35-22,CASTLE>所以她前妻决定把他也干掉
<35-22,CASTLE>So his ex-wife decided to add him to the pile.

948
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:47,290
<36-1,ELISE>为什么又找我来  知道的我都说了
<36-1,ELISE>I'm not sure why I'm here. I've told you everything I know.

949
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:48,520
<36-2,BECKETT>不  你没有全说
<36-2,BECKETT>No. Not everything.

950
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,420
<36-2,BECKETT>你没告诉我们你现在是莫德斯托汽车的
<36-2,BECKETT>You didn't tell us that you were lead counsel

951
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:51,380
<36-2,BECKETT>首席律师
<36-2,BECKETT>for modesto motors,

952
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:53,660
<36-2,BECKETT>你也没告诉我们气囊有缺陷的事
<36-2,BECKETT>and you didn't tell us about the airbags.

953
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:54,870
<36-3,CASTLE>就是那些弹出时能在人体上
<36-3,CASTLE>You know, those airbags with the habit

954
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:58,380
<36-3,CASTLE>打穿小洞的气囊  像朱迪·埃文斯那样
<36-3,CASTLE>of putting holes in people, like Jody Evans.

955
00:35:58,380 --> 00:35:59,320
<36-4,ELISE>你说什么啊
<36-4,ELISE>Excuse me?

956
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:02,210
<36-5,BECKETT>莱斯纳女士  里奇那天为什么给你打电话
<36-5,BECKETT>Ms. Resner, why did Richie really call you the other day?

957
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:04,480
<36-6,CASTLE>是想先提醒你一下吧
<36-6,CASTLE>Was it to give you a little heads-up?

958
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,990
<36-6,CASTLE>看在过去交情的份上
<36-6,CASTLE>You know -- for old times' sake?

959
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:08,250
<36-6,CASTLE>因为过去他帮助掩盖缺陷时
<36-6,CASTLE>Because that defect he helped cover up back then,

960
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:09,520
<36-6,CASTLE>你也参与了
<36-6,CASTLE>you were in on that, too.

961
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,670
<36-7,BECKETT>他想公开此事
<36-7,BECKETT>He was going public with it,

962
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:12,450
<36-7,BECKETT>不希望你到时候一无所知
<36-7,BECKETT>and he didn't want you to be blindsided.

963
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:14,410
<36-8,CASTLE>但你不能允许他这么做
<36-8,CASTLE>But you couldn't let that happen --

964
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:16,800
<36-8,CASTLE>对莫德斯托不利对你更不利
<36-8,CASTLE>not to Modesto and certainly not to you.

965
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,840
<36-8,CASTLE>所以你灭了他的口
<36-8,CASTLE>So you had him silenced.

966
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,740
<36-9,ELISE>你认为是我杀了我前夫
<36-9,ELISE>You think I killed my ex-husband?

967
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:25,860
<36-9,ELISE>探长  里奇的死和我毫无关系
<36-9,ELISE>Detective, I had nothing to do with Richie's death.

968
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:29,950
<36-9,ELISE>还有  也不存在什么缺陷或者隐瞒真相
<36-9,ELISE>And, by the way, there is no defect or cover-up.

969
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:31,360
<36-10,CASTLE>里奇可不这么认为
<36-10,CASTLE>Richie knew otherwise.

970
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,370
<36-10,CASTLE>事实上  为了证明此事他还干过非法闯入
<36-10,CASTLE>In fact, he committed a break-in just to prove it.

971
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:35,330
<36-11,BECKETT>我们发现三天前莫德斯托汽车的
<36-11,BECKETT>We found that a silent alarm was tripped

972
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:37,910
<36-11,BECKETT>仓库有一个无声警铃被触发过
<36-11,BECKETT>at a Modesto Motors storage facility three nights ago.

973
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:39,340
<36-11,BECKETT>但警方赶到时
<36-11,BECKETT>But when police responded,

974
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:41,710
<36-11,BECKETT>负责人却声称是意外触发的
<36-11,BECKETT>they were told it was set off by mistake.

975
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:44,350
<36-12,CASTLE>然而那晚救护车被叫来
<36-12,CASTLE>Yet an ambulance was called there that night

976
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:47,110
<36-12,CASTLE>治疗一位吸入氯仿的警卫
<36-12,CASTLE>to treat a guard for chloroform inhalation.

977
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,600
<36-13,ELISE>我不知道那件事
<36-13,ELISE>I'm not familiar with that incident.

978
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:51,390
<36-14,BECKETT>那你知道这个吗
<36-14,BECKETT>Well, are you familiar with this?

979
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,630
<36-15,BECKETT>这是你掩盖真相的证据
<36-15,BECKETT>It's evidence of your cover-up.

980
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:57,780
<36-16,ELISE>如果这假人是通过非法手段
<36-16,ELISE>If this dummy was illegally obtained

981
00:36:57,790 --> 00:36:59,410
<36-16,ELISE>从莫德斯托仓库盗取
<36-16,ELISE>from a Modesto storage facility,

982
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:01,150
<36-16,ELISE>那它依旧是莫德斯托的财产
<36-16,ELISE>then it is the property of ,

983
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:02,160
<36-16,ELISE>我们想要取回
<36-16,ELISE>and we'd like it back.

984
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,180
<36-17,BECKETT>那当然
<36-17,BECKETT>I'm sure you would,

985
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,560
<36-17,BECKETT>尤其是考虑到这个假人会导致你的公司
<36-17,BECKETT>especially considering it could cost your company

986
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:08,250
<36-17,BECKETT>数百万美元的损失
<36-17,BECKETT>hundreds of millions of dollars.

987
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:11,780
<36-17,BECKETT>所以你才会雇这个人取回假人
<36-17,BECKETT>Which is why you hired this man to retrieve it.

988
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:13,940
<36-18,BECKETT>我们正在核查他的财务记录
<36-18,BECKETT>We're looking into his financial records right now.

989
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:16,850
<36-18,BECKETT>早晚会将他和莫德斯托联系起来
<36-18,BECKETT>It's only a matter of time before we connect him to Modesto.

990
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,850
<36-19,ELISE>你完全搞错了  探长
<36-19,ELISE>You're barking up the wrong tree, detective.

991
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:22,460
<36-19,ELISE>莫德斯托有内部调查员
<36-19,ELISE>Modesto has its own in-house investigators.

992
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:24,720
<36-19,ELISE>如果我们想取回假人  如你所说
<36-19,ELISE>If we wanted to recover this dummy, as you claim,

993
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,640
<36-19,ELISE>我们为什么要把如此敏感之事交给外人
<36-19,ELISE>why would we entrust such a sensitive task to an outsider?

994
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,820
<36-20,ELISE>但我见过这个人
<36-20,ELISE>But I have seen this man before.

995
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,580
<36-21,CASTLE>在哪
<36-21,CASTLE>Where?

996
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:34,290
<36-22,ELISE>圣西蒙医院门口
<36-22,ELISE>In front of St. Simon's hospital.

997
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,870
<36-22,ELISE>他坐在车里  跟某人谈话
<36-22,ELISE>He was sitting in a car, conferring with someone else.

998
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,960
<36-23,BECKETT>跟谁谈话
<36-23,BECKETT>Conferring with whom?

999
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:41,370
<37-1,ARCHIE>欠你一次现金和解
<37-1,ARCHIE>Owed a cash settlement?

1000
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:42,950
<37-1,ARCHIE>巨锤出场
<37-1,ARCHIE>It's hammer time.

1001
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,450
<37-1,ARCHIE>我会大锤特锤
<37-1,ARCHIE>I'll pound and pound away

1002
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:46,910
<37-1,ARCHIE>直到拿到你应得的现金
<37-1,ARCHIE>till I've nailed down the cash you've got coming.

1003
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:48,260
<37-1,ARCHIE>任何阻挡你的人
<37-1,ARCHIE>Anyone gets in your way,

1004
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:51,340
<37-1,ARCHIE>都得先过我这关  草原巨锤
<37-1,ARCHIE>they'll have to deal with me -- the Savannah Hammer.

1005
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:55,310
<37-2,CASTLE>里奇·法科就是落得这下场吗
<37-2,CASTLE>Is that what happened to Richie Falco?

1006
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,330
<37-2,CASTLE>他阻碍了你  就被你锤死了
<37-2,CASTLE>He got in your way, so you pounded him till he was dead?

1007
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:00,910
<37-2,CASTLE>不好意思  我们正在拍...
<37-2,CASTLE>Excuse me! We're filming h--

1008
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:04,440
<37-3,ARCHIE>卡塞尔先生  希望你
<37-3,ARCHIE>Mr. Castle, I will thank you

1009
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,890
<37-3,ARCHIE>带着你那空口无凭的指控到外面去等着
<37-3,ARCHIE>and your ridiculous allegations to wait outside.

1010
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:09,510
<37-4,BECKETT>不再是空口无凭了
<37-4,BECKETT>They're not just allegations -- not anymore.

1011
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:11,080
<37-4,BECKETT>麦克·桑普森供出了你
<37-4,BECKETT>Mike Sampson gave you up.

1012
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,890
<37-4,BECKETT>一名目击证人看到你俩在一起
<37-4,BECKETT>A witness placed the two of you together,

1013
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:14,170
<37-4,BECKETT>桑普森不希望跟
<37-4,BECKETT>and Sampson was more than eager

1014
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:15,960
<37-4,BECKETT>谋杀沾上关系
<37-4,BECKETT>to distance himself from the murder.

1015
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,220
<37-5,CASTLE>但他供认闯入里奇的办公室
<37-5,CASTLE>But he did admit to breaking into Richie's office

1016
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:20,710
<37-5,CASTLE>并从我们手中劫走碰撞试验假人
<37-5,CASTLE>and hijacking the crash-test dummy from us

1017
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:22,230
<37-5,CASTLE>都是因为你雇了他
<37-5,CASTLE>because you paid him to.

1018
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:24,130
<37-6,ARCHIE>我不知道你们在说什么
<37-6,ARCHIE>I really don't know what you're talking about.

1019
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:25,280
<37-6,ARCHIE>你知道
<37-6,ARCHIE>Oh, I think you do.

1020
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:27,600
<37-7,CASTLE>你知道莫德斯托会支付数百万美元
<37-7,CASTLE>You knew Modesto would pay millions

1021
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,180
<37-7,CASTLE>赎回那假人
<37-7,CASTLE>to get that dummy back.

1022
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:31,780
<37-7,CASTLE>你如此确定  甚至承诺给麦克分成
<37-7,CASTLE>Matter of fact, you were so sure, you promised Mike a cut.

1023
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:32,960
<37-8,ARCHIE>太疯狂了
<37-8,ARCHIE>This is crazy.

1024
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,840
<37-8,ARCHIE>我从没雇人偷东西
<37-8,ARCHIE>I never paid anyone to steal anything.

1025
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:37,510
<37-8,ARCHIE>我也没杀斗牛犬  我有不在场证明
<37-8,ARCHIE>And I didn't kill the Pitbull. I have an alibi.

1026
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:39,110
<37-9,BECKETT>你没有了
<37-9,BECKETT>No. Not anymore.

1027
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:40,450
<37-9,BECKETT>为你提供不在场证明的人
<37-9,BECKETT>Once your alibi found out

1028
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:42,900
<37-9,BECKETT>得知她面临谋杀从犯的指控
<37-9,BECKETT>she was facing accessory-to-murder charges,

1029
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:45,430
<37-9,BECKETT>她撤回了作证  承认你雇了她
<37-9,BECKETT>she recanted and admitted that you paid her.

1030
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,090
<37-10,CASTLE>我们找到了电击枪  巨锤
<37-10,CASTLE>We found the taser, Hammer --

1031
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:49,990
<37-10,CASTLE>在你车后箱  就在撬胎棒旁边
<37-10,CASTLE>In the back of your car, right next to that tire iron.

1032
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:52,400
<37-11,BECKETT>你虽然将其清洗过  但你忘了车毯上
<37-11,BECKETT>Which you bleached, but you forgot about the droplets

1033
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,950
<37-11,BECKETT>的血液残留
<37-11,BECKETT>of blood residue on the carpet.

1034
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,320
<37-11,BECKETT>你认为当我们发现那与
<37-11,BECKETT>What do you think is gonna happen

1035
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,860
<37-11,BECKETT>里奇的血样匹配会发生什么
<37-11,BECKETT>when we test it against Richie's dna?

1036
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:01,140
<37-11,BECKETT>都结束了
<37-11,BECKETT>It's over.

1037
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,890
<37-12,CASTLE>我想不通为什么
<37-12,CASTLE>You know, what I can't figure out is why.

1038
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,380
<37-12,CASTLE>为什么
<37-12,CASTLE>Why?

1039
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:13,140
<37-13,ARCHIE>因为他看不出那假人是个金矿
<37-13,ARCHIE>Because he couldn't see that that dummy was a gold mine.

1040
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:15,820
<37-13,ARCHIE>他只想追求正义
<37-13,ARCHIE>And all he wanted was justice?

1041
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:18,230
<37-13,ARCHIE>你跟他一样天真
<37-13,ARCHIE>You're as naive as he was.

1042
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,520
<37-14,BECKETT>走吧  巨锤
<37-14,BECKETT>Let's go, Hammer.

<38-1,RYAN>看看是谁出现了
<38-1,RYAN>Look who decided to show up.

<38-3,BECKETT>We got held up giving a statement at NTSB.

1049
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:38,210
<38-4,CASTLE>但欣慰的是  他们将对
<38-4,CASTLE>But you'll be happy to know they're launching

<38-7,RYAN>We are no longer two-time champs.

1062
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,190
<38-10,CASTLE>对手实力较弱
<38-10,CASTLE>was a little light this year.

1063
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,680
<38-12,RYAN>说到这个  不是有个赌注
<38-12,RYAN>Speaking of which, isn't there a certain bet

1064
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:11,450
<38-13,ESPOSITO>该算一算了吗
<38-13,ESPOSITO>that needs settling?

1065
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:13,450
<38-14,RYAN>对  公开声明
<38-14,RYAN>Oh, right -- the dedication.

1066
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:16,190
<38-14,RYAN>就看字体弄多大了
<38-14,RYAN>I guess it's just a matter of how big to make that font size.

1067
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:17,850
<38-15,CASTLE>不是吧
<38-15,CASTLE>Seriously? Come on.

1068
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:19,740
<38-15,CASTLE>我们都没有机会正面交锋
<38-15,CASTLE>Guys, we didn't even get a chance to square off.

1069
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:22,750
<38-16,RYAN>所以我们不跟你们计较
<38-16,RYAN>Which is why we're not gonna hold you to it.

1070
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:24,440
<38-16,RYAN>不跟你算账了  卡塞尔
<38-16,RYAN>You're off the hook, Castle.

<38-17,CASTLE>谢谢  你们真大度
<38-17,CASTLE>Thank you. Thank you. That's very big of you.

1072
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:30,500
<38-17,CASTLE>尤其考虑到我们本可以击溃你们的
<38-17,CASTLE>Especially considering we would have kicked your asses.

1073
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:33,570
<38-18,ESPOSITO>说大话
<38-18,ESPOSITO>Uh... now, you gonna talk smack?

00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:37,200
<38-18,ESPOSITO>那咱们
<38-18,ESPOSITO>Well, then we are gonna settle this...

1075
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:39,590
<38-18,ESPOSITO>现在在这里对决
<38-18,ESPOSITO>right here, right now.

1076
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:41,070
<38-19,RYAN>咱把桌子都移开
<38-19,RYAN>Why don't we just clear all these desks,

1077
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:43,690
<38-19,RYAN>硬碰硬  让分局的人决定胜负
<38-19,RYAN>go head-to-head, let the precinct decide!

1078
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:49,370
<38-20,CASTLE>不  你们想显摆显摆  让给你们
<38-20,CASTLE>No. You want bragging rights? They're yours.

1079
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:51,010
<38-20,CASTLE>我们的舞步对你们来说  太牛掰
<38-20,CASTLE>Our routine's too good for you, anyway.

1080
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:52,750
<38-22,ESPOSITO>就知道他怂了
<38-22,ESPOSITO>That's what I thought.

1081
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:53,850
<38-22,ESPOSITO>可不是
<38-22,ESPOSITO>Yeah.

1082
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,060
<39-1,BECKETT>你什么时候会拒绝挑战
<39-1,BECKETT>Since when do you turn down a challenge?

1083
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:02,580
<39-2,CASTLE>他们知道我们更厉害  没必要让他们出糗
<39-2,CASTLE>Oh, they know we're better. No sense in embarrassing them.

1084
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,520
<39-3,BECKETT>你知道了  是吧
<39-3,BECKETT>You know, don't you?

1085
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:06,030
<39-4,CASTLE>知道什么
<39-4,CASTLE>Know what?

1086
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,940
<39-5,BECKETT>所以我们才会退赛
<39-5,BECKETT>That's why we got pulled from the lineup.

1087
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:09,560
<39-5,BECKETT>坎莫尔是你好友
<39-5,BECKETT>Kimmel's your bud.

1088
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,560
<39-5,BECKETT>肯定是你打电话给他  让他表演
<39-5,BECKETT>You must have called him and told him to perform

1089
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:12,790
<39-5,BECKETT>我们就不用出场了
<39-5,BECKETT>so we wouldn't have to.

1090
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:15,450
<39-5,BECKETT>我就不用出场了
<39-5,BECKETT>Or...so that I wouldn't have to.

1091
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:19,090
<39-6,CASTLE>我可能偷听到了你和我母亲的谈话
<39-6,CASTLE>I...may have overheard you talking to my mother.

1092
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:20,660
<39-7,BECKETT>你这么做是为了我
<39-7,BECKETT>You did that for me?

1093
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:23,290
<39-8,CASTLE>你为我会做出同样的牺牲
<39-8,CASTLE>No more of a sacrifice than what you were gonna do for me.

1094
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:25,680
<39-8,CASTLE>凯特  你为什么不直说
<39-8,CASTLE>Kate, why wouldn't you just say something?

1095
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:29,320
<39-9,BECKETT>我不想让你看低我
<39-9,BECKETT>I didn't want you to think less of me.

1096
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:32,550
<39-9,BECKETT>我不想让其他人知道
<39-9,BECKETT>And I really didn't want anyone else to know, so...

1097
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:34,640
<39-10,CASTLE>蠢死了
<39-10,CASTLE>Stupid.

1098
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:37,100
<39-10,CASTLE>不蠢  人之常情
<39-10,CASTLE>No. Not stupid. Just human.

1099
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:40,530
<39-11,BECKETT>不能为观众表演
<39-11,BECKETT>Aren't you disappointed

1100
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:42,910
<39-11,BECKETT>你一点都不失望吗
<39-11,BECKETT>you're not gonna be able to perform for an audience?

1101
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:44,810
<39-12,CASTLE>我在乎的观众只有你
<39-12,CASTLE>The only audience I care about is you.

1102
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:49,520
<40-1,CASTLE>*你不知道吗  小笨蛋*
<40-1,CASTLE>*Don't you know, little fool*

1103
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:51,810
<40-1,CASTLE>*你永远赢不了*
<40-1,CASTLE>*You never can win*

1104
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:56,570
<40-2,BECKETT>*用用你的心智*
<40-2,BECKETT>*Use your mentality*

1105
00:41:57,050 --> 00:41:59,730
<40-3,CASTLE>*在现实中醒过来吧*
<40-3,CASTLE>*Wake up to reality*

1106
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:05,280
<40-4,BECKETT>*每当我如此  只会想到你*
<40-4,BECKETT>*But each time I do, just the thought of you?*

1107
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,650
<40-5,CASTLE>*令我在开始之前  立刻停止*
<40-5,CASTLE>*Makes me stop before I begin*

1108
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:10,950
<40-5,CASTLE>*因为我把你*
<40-5,CASTLE>*'cause I've got you*

1109
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,500
<40-5,CASTLE>*深深地迷住了*
<40-5,CASTLE>*Under my skin*
