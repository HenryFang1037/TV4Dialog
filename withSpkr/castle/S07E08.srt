1
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:03,820
<1-1,RICHARD CASTLE>你觉得怎么样
<1-1,RICHARD CASTLE>So, what do you think?

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:05,600
<1-1,RICHARD CASTLE>-这感觉不一样了  是吧  -什么
<1-1,RICHARD CASTLE>- This feels different, doesn't it? - What does?

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:07,710
<1-3,CASTLE>作为已婚夫妇一起赶到犯罪现场
<1-3,CASTLE>Rolling up to a crime scene as a married couple.

5
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:08,820
<1-3,CASTLE>我们就像是尼克和诺拉·查尔斯那样的侦探夫妻
<1-3,CASTLE>We're like Nick and Nora Charles.

6
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,640
<1-4,BECKETT>或者是《麦克米伦夫妇》
<1-4,BECKETT>Ooh, like "McMillan & wife."

8
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,000
<1-5,CASTLE>-《哈特夫妇》  -《福星与福将》
<1-5,CASTLE>- "Hart to hart." - "Turner & hooch."

9
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,200
<1-7,CASTLE>福星和福将又不是夫妻
<1-7,CASTLE>Turner and Hooch aren't even married.

10
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,520
<1-8,BECKETT>是啊  但我还是觉得你有点像福将[狗]
<1-8,BECKETT>Yeah, but you still remind me a little of hooch.

11
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:24,040
<1-9,BECKETT>早间咖啡
<1-9,BECKETT>So, uh, morning blend?

12
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,400
<1-9,BECKETT>-这是刚刚发生的事吗  -嗯
<1-9,BECKETT>- Did this just happen? - Yeah.

13
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,910
<1-10,KEVIN RYAN>慢跑者大概一小时前发现他的
<1-10,KEVIN RYAN>Jogger found him about an hour ago.

14
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,630
<1-11,LANIE PARISH>他也是那时候死的
<1-11,LANIE PARISH>Which was about the time he died.

15
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:31,190
<1-11,LANIE PARISH>不用说  死因很明显
<1-11,LANIE PARISH>Needless to say, - pretty obvious what killed him.

16
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:32,620
<1-11,LANIE PARISH>头部中枪
<1-11,LANIE PARISH>Gunshot wound to the head.

17
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:34,130
<1-12,JAVIER ESPOSITO>他是保罗·里夫斯  皇后区人
<1-12,JAVIER ESPOSITO>"Him" being Paul Reeves out of Queens.

18
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:35,440
<1-12,JAVIER ESPOSITO>我们正在查近亲
<1-12,JAVIER ESPOSITO>We're running down next of kin.

19
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,940
<1-13,BECKETT>-有人听到枪声吗  -没有  公园这一带
<1-13,BECKETT>- Anyone hear the shot? - No, and there's no video coverage

20
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:39,220
<1-14,RYAN>也没有监控
<1-14,RYAN>in this area of the park.

21
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:40,270
<1-15,ESPOSITO>凶手大概知道
<1-15,ESPOSITO>The killer probably knew that.

22
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,200
<1-15,ESPOSITO>拿了里夫斯的手机和钱包里的现金
<1-15,ESPOSITO>Took Reeves' phone, cash from his wallet,

23
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,540
<1-15,ESPOSITO>然后大概大摇大摆走出去了
<1-15,ESPOSITO>and probably waltzed right out of here.

24
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:44,770
<1-15,ESPOSITO>看来是抢劫升级
<1-15,ESPOSITO>Looks like a mugging gone wrong.

25
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:46,060
<1-16,CASTLE>没有挣扎的迹象
<1-16,CASTLE>Well, there's no signs of struggle.

26
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:48,110
<1-16,CASTLE>如果是抢劫  他可没抵抗
<1-16,CASTLE>If this was a mugging and he didn't put up a fight,

27
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:50,620
<1-16,CASTLE>何必冒险在大白天开枪杀人
<1-16,CASTLE>why risk shooting him, especially in broad daylight?

28
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:53,860
<1-17,BECKETT>烧焦的布料
<1-17,BECKETT>Singed fabric.

29
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:56,780
<1-17,BECKETT>没人听到声音是因为凶手用了背包
<1-17,BECKETT>Nobody heard anything because the killer used a backpack

30
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,780
<1-17,BECKETT>或布闷住了枪声
<1-17,BECKETT>or cloth to muffle the shot.

33
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:02,100
<1-18,CASTLE>然后拿走了被害人的手机和钱迷惑我们
<1-18,CASTLE>And then took the victim's phone and cash to throw us off track.

34
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,430
<1-19,BECKETT>这不是抢劫
<1-19,BECKETT>This wasn't a mugging.

36
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:05,790
<1-19,BECKETT>是谋杀
<1-19,BECKETT>This was a deliberate murder.

38
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:08,880
<2-1,BRENT REEVES>这说不通啊
<2-1,BRENT REEVES>That just doesn't make sense.

39
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,540
<2-1,BRENT REEVES>保罗完全没有敌人
<2-1,BRENT REEVES>Paul didn't have an enemy in the world.

41
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:13,660
<2-2,BECKETT>你对你哥哥有多了解
<2-2,BECKETT>Well, how much do you know about your brother's life?

42
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:15,750
<2-2,BECKETT>-你们亲近吗  -很亲近
<2-2,BECKETT>- Were you close? - Very close.

43
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:19,470
<2-3,BRENT>保罗最近一个月一直住在我那里
<2-3,BRENT>In fact, Paul had been staying at my place for the past month.

44
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:23,230
<2-3,BRENT>他在等待一间公寓第三方支付的完成
<2-3,BRENT>He was waiting to close escrow on a condo.

45
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,840
<2-4,CASTLE>他常去公园喝咖啡吗
<2-4,CASTLE>Was having coffee in the park something he did often?

46
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,310
<2-5,BRENT>他从不去中央公园
<2-5,BRENT>He never went to the park.

47
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,980
<2-5,BRENT>他几乎不离办公室
<2-5,BRENT>He hardly ever left the office.

48
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,660
<2-5,BRENT>保罗是个工作狂
<2-5,BRENT>Paul was a complete workaholic.

49
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,240
<2-6,BECKETT>他是做什么的
<2-6,BECKETT>And what did he do, exactly?

50
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,560
<2-7,BRENT>他是政府调查员  总审计局的
<2-7,BRENT>He was an investigator for the government, the G.A.O.

51
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,710
<2-7,BRENT>除此之外我就不清楚了
<2-7,BRENT>I don't know much more than that.

52
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,430
<2-7,BRENT>他不能多说工作上的事
<2-7,BRENT>He really couldn't discuss his job.

53
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:43,840
<2-8,BECKETT>你知道他在单位遇到什么麻烦了吗
<2-8,BECKETT>Was he having any troubles at work that you're aware of?

54
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:49,260
<2-9,BRENT>应该不算麻烦  但昨晚我们一起喝啤酒
<2-9,BRENT>Not trouble exactly, but...Last night, we had a beer.

55
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:53,350
<2-9,BRENT>保罗说有刚约了个重要的见面  很让他担心
<2-9,BRENT>Paul said a crucial meeting came up that he was worried about.

56
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:55,910
<2-10,BECKETT>什么样的见面  跟谁
<2-10,BECKETT>What kind of a meeting? I mean w-with whom?

57
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:57,960
<2-11,BRENT>他没说  但他接到了他一宗案件
<2-11,BRENT>He didn't say, but he'd got a disturbing call

58
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,210
<2-11,BRENT>涉及到的一个人的骚扰电话
<2-11,BRENT>from someone involved in one of his cases.

59
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:01,270
<2-11,BRENT>他说
<2-11,BRENT>And he said...

60
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:06,300
<2-11,BRENT>那个见面  好像就是在今早
<2-11,BRENT>That meeting... I think that was supposed to happen this morning.

61
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,670
<2-11,BRENT>抱歉  但如果他有约见面
<2-11,BRENT>I-I'm sorry, but if he had a meeting,

62
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:11,460
<2-11,BRENT>他也没跟我说过
<2-11,BRENT>he never mentioned anything to me,

63
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,340
<2-11,BRENT>不过这不算不寻常
<2-11,BRENT>Though I suppose that wasn't unusual.

64
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:16,020
<2-11,BRENT>我对他管得很松  保罗是我最好的调查员
<2-11,BRENT>I gave him a lot of latitude. Paul was my top investigator.

65
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,590
<3-1,RYAN>保罗究竟调查什么
<3-1,RYAN>What exactly did Paul investigate?

66
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,810
<3-2,ESPOSITO>我们是联邦机构
<3-2,ESPOSITO>We're a federal agency.

67
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,840
<3-3,ESPOSITO>总审计局审核政府项目和合同
<3-3,ESPOSITO>G.A.O. evaluates government programs and contracts

68
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,110
<3-1,RYAN>清除浪费  诈骗和滥用职权
<3-1,RYAN>to root out waste, fraud, and abuse.

69
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:26,560
<3-2,ESPOSITO>比如国防部合同一个锤子要五百
<3-2,ESPOSITO>Like defense contractors billing 500 bucks for a hammer.

70
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:29,220
<3-2,ESPOSITO>是的  但保罗是医疗部的
<3-2,ESPOSITO>Yes, though Paul - was in the healthcare division.

71
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,710
<4-1,BECKETT>他监管有政府合同的
<4-1,BECKETT>He oversaw hospitals and medical services

72
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,580
<3-2,ESPOSITO>医院和医疗服务  这一类的
<3-2,ESPOSITO>with government contracts... that sort of thing.

73
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:34,920
<3-3,ESPOSITO>那么如果有人在骗政府的钱
<3-3,ESPOSITO>So if someone was fleecing Uncle Sam,

74
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,620
<3-3,ESPOSITO>他可以取消他们的合同
<3-3,ESPOSITO>he could cancel their contracts?

75
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:39,650
<3-3,ESPOSITO>他会写可能导致这事的报告  是的
<3-3,ESPOSITO>He wrote reports that could produce that result, yes.

76
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:41,830
<3-4,RYAN>是否有人曾给保罗施压
<3-4,RYAN>Did anyone ever pressure Paul

77
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:43,820
<3-4,RYAN>让他停止哪个案子的调查
<3-4,RYAN>to back off a report or investigation?

78
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,660
<3-4,RYAN>不是那样的  我们是独立机构
<3-4,RYAN>It doesn't work that way. We're an independent body, so...

79
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,360
<3-5,RYAN>虽然如此
<3-5,RYAN>Be that as it may,

80
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,860
<3-5,RYAN>我们需要所有他正在进行中的调查的档案
<3-5,RYAN>we need the files of all his active investigations.

81
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,500
<4-1,BECKETT>保罗·里夫斯有超过20件在查案件
<4-1,BECKETT>Paul Reeves had over 20 open cases,

82
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:55,780
<4-1,BECKETT>而且他调查的一些对象很有背景
<4-1,BECKETT>and he was taking on some major players...

83
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:58,300
<4-1,BECKETT>一家骗医疗保险的连锁医院
<4-1,BECKETT>A hospital chain that defrauded medicare,

84
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:02,980
<4-1,BECKETT>莱瑟姆制药一家实验室被报存储管理松懈
<4-1,BECKETT>a-a lab at Latham Pharmaceuticals cited for lax storage practices,

85
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:06,170
<4-1,BECKETT>还有一家售卖残次医疗用品的公司
<4-1,BECKETT>and a company that sold the V.A. defective medical equipment.

86
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:07,880
<4-2,CASTLE>我嗅到了浓浓的阴谋气息
<4-2,CASTLE>I feel the heavy hand of conspiracy.

87
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,380
<4-3,BECKETT>还有什么我不知道的
<4-3,BECKETT>Yeah, well, what else is new?

88
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:12,580
<4-4,CASTLE>想想  保罗揭露了一桩不法丑闻
<4-4,CASTLE>Consider this... Paul uncovers a nefarious scandal

89
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:15,410
<4-4,CASTLE>充斥着腐败和金融欺诈
<4-4,CASTLE>rife with corruption and financial skullduggery

90
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:17,250
<4-4,CASTLE>且与联邦合同有关
<4-4,CASTLE>in connection with a federal contract,

91
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:20,350
<4-4,CASTLE>但由于事关上百万美金  贪婪的承包商
<4-4,CASTLE>but with millions of dollars at stake, the greedy contractor,

92
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,270
<4-4,CASTLE>决心抓住联邦合同
<4-4,CASTLE>determined to stay latched onto the federal teat,

93
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:25,570
<4-4,CASTLE>便以见面为由引保罗去了公园
<4-4,CASTLE>lures Paul into a meeting in the park

94
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:27,050
<4-4,CASTLE>并雇凶在那里杀死了他
<4-4,CASTLE>where he has an assassin silence him.

95
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:30,200
<4-4,CASTLE>于是  保罗的发现便被永远埋没
<4-4,CASTLE>Thus, Paul's findings never come to light.

96
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:31,870
<4-5,BECKETT>那么你有猜到是保罗的
<4-5,BECKETT>And I don't suppose that you have

97
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:34,480
<4-5,BECKETT>哪件案子吗
<4-5,BECKETT>a particular case of Paul's in mind, do you?

98
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:37,850
<4-5,BECKETT>或者任何证据  嫌疑人
<4-5,BECKETT>Or proof? Or suspects?

99
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,770
<4-6,CASTLE>没有  但等你查明在公园见保罗的人是谁
<4-6,CASTLE>No, but I will once you identify who met

100
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:41,750
<4-6,CASTLE>我就会有理论了
<4-6,CASTLE>Paul at the park.

101
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,770
<4-7,RYAN>我可能稍稍查到了一点
<4-7,RYAN>I might be a step closer to that.

102
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:45,580
<4-7,RYAN>还记得保罗的弟弟说
<4-7,RYAN>Do you remember how Paul's brother mentioned

103
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,420
<4-7,RYAN>那个见面是刚约的吗
<4-7,RYAN>that a "meeting" had just come up?

104
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:50,520
<4-7,RYAN>我查看了保罗手机过去48小时的通话记录
<4-7,RYAN>Well, I looked into Paul's phone calls for the last 48 hours.

105
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,230
<4-7,RYAN>其中一个很特别
<4-7,RYAN>One of them stood out...

106
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,630
<4-7,RYAN>昨天上午11点4分打去他办公室的一通电话
<4-7,RYAN>An incoming call to his office at 11:04 yesterday morning.

107
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,310
<4-7,RYAN>不到一分钟
<4-7,RYAN>Call lasted less than a minute,

108
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:00,700
<4-7,RYAN>经查是下东区一部付费电话打来的
<4-7,RYAN>And I traced it to a pay phone on the lower east side.

109
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,260
<4-8,BECKETT>查查这通电话是谁打的
<4-8,BECKETT>Try and find out who made that call.

110
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,150
<4-9,RYAN>嗯
<4-9,RYAN>Yeah.

111
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,340
<5-1,TORY ELLIS>这是那部电话的街头监控录像
<5-1,TORY ELLIS>This is street-cam video of the pay phone.

112
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,120
<5-1,TORY ELLIS>昨天上午11点4分
<5-1,TORY ELLIS>11:04 yesterday morning...

113
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,370
<5-1,TORY ELLIS>就是这人打给了保罗·里夫斯
<5-1,TORY ELLIS>This is the man who called Paul Reeves.

114
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:12,610
<5-2,RYAN>托瑞检索了图像  找到了匹配的人
<5-2,RYAN>Tory ran the image - and got a match on his face.

115
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:18,030
<5-3,CASTLE>杰瑞德·斯通  电脑侵入轻罪
<5-3,CASTLE>Jared Stone... misdemeanor computer trespassing?

116
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:19,710
<5-4,TORY>俗称黑客
<5-4,TORY>Otherwise known as hacking.

117
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,490
<5-5,RYAN>斯通曾是占领华尔街的积极分子
<5-5,RYAN>Stone was - an occupy wall street activist

118
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,360
<5-5,RYAN>他黑进一些大银行  公开了一些邮件
<5-5,RYAN>who hacked into a major bank, releasing their e-mails,

119
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,630
<5-5,RYAN>对他们的生意造成了影响
<5-5,RYAN>which reflected poorly on their business practices.

120
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,620
<5-6,BECKETT>杰瑞德·斯通这样的黑客
<5-6,BECKETT>So why would a hacker like Jared Stone

121
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,490
<5-6,BECKETT>为什么要杀一个总审计局的调查员
<5-6,BECKETT>kill a G.A.O. investigator?

122
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:31,340
<5-6,BECKETT>他没有
<5-6,BECKETT>He wouldn't.

123
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,410
<5-7,CASTLE>这个逻辑说不通
<5-7,CASTLE>That story doesn't make any sense.

124
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:33,460
<5-7,CASTLE>但这个理论可以
<5-7,CASTLE>But this one does.

125
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,720
<5-7,CASTLE>凭借自己的黑客技术
<5-7,CASTLE>Using his vaunted hacking skills,

126
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,570
<5-7,CASTLE>杰瑞德·斯通发现了一桩不法丑闻
<5-7,CASTLE>Jared Stone is the one who uncovered the nefarious scandal.

127
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:39,980
<5-8,BECKETT>我们又回到不法丑闻上去了
<5-8,BECKETT>So we're back to a nefarious scandal?

128
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,240
<5-9,CASTLE>是的  他想揭发丑闻
<5-9,CASTLE>Yes, see, he wants to blow the lid off a scandal,

129
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,650
<5-9,CASTLE>那有什么比打电话给
<5-9,CASTLE>so who better to call

130
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:47,240
<5-9,CASTLE>无畏的调查员保罗·里夫斯更好的办法呢
<5-9,CASTLE>than intrepid investigator Paul Reeves?

131
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:51,580
<5-9,CASTLE>因为  杰瑞德·斯通是告密者
<5-9,CASTLE>Because -- wait for it -- Jared Stone is a whistle-blower.

132
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,750
<5-9,CASTLE>保罗·里夫斯被杀
<5-9,CASTLE>And Paul Reeves was murdered

133
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,680
<5-9,CASTLE>是因为他知道了杰瑞德·斯通发现的违法行径
<5-9,CASTLE>because of what Jared Stone told him,

134
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:57,540
<5-9,CASTLE>因此  杰瑞德现在也许有危险
<5-9,CASTLE>which...which actually means he could be in danger now.

135
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,550
<5-10,RYAN>不得不承认   卡塞尔的推理
<5-10,RYAN>You have to admit, Castle's theory is...

136
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:00,780
<5-10,RYAN>很有逻辑
<5-10,RYAN>surprisingly logical.

137
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:03,090
<5-11,BECKETT>对  而且恰巧毫无证据
<5-11,BECKETT>Yes, and it's conveniently unburdened by evidence.

138
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:05,290
<5-11,BECKETT>不管怎样  带杰瑞德·斯通来问话
<5-11,BECKETT>Nevertheless, let's bring Jared Stone in for questioning,

139
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:07,310
<5-11,BECKETT>同时去看下投币电话
<5-11,BECKETT>and let's take a look at the video footage of that pay phone

140
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,270
<5-11,BECKETT>过去两周的录像
<5-11,BECKETT>for the past two weeks.

141
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:10,640
<5-11,BECKETT>如果杰瑞德·斯通与人谈过  我要知道是谁
<5-11,BECKETT>If Jared Stone talked to anyone, I want to know who it was.

142
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,610
<5-12,ESPOSITO>我们可能查到他地址了
<5-12,ESPOSITO>Yo, we may have an address on Jared Stone.

143
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:13,340
<5-12,ESPOSITO>我刚查了他的邮件
<5-12,ESPOSITO>I ran his e-mails.

144
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,930
<5-12,ESPOSITO>他在信息网上租了间下西区的房
<5-12,ESPOSITO>He rented a place on the lower west off Craigslist.

145
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:17,320
<5-12,ESPOSITO>-行动  -收到
<5-12,ESPOSITO>- Go. - Yeah, okay.

146
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,810
<6-1,ESPOSITO>你的婚姻生活如何啊
<6-1,ESPOSITO>So, what's going on with married life, huh?

147
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,370
<6-1,ESPOSITO>家里还好吗
<6-1,ESPOSITO>How is that -- the whole family thing?

148
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:27,990
<6-2,RYAN>我女儿长得太快了
<6-2,RYAN>Sarah Grace, she's -- she's growing up, changing so fast.

149
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:30,350
<6-2,RYAN>我想紧握她成长的每一刻
<6-2,RYAN>Just trying to hold on to every second.

150
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,070
<6-3,ESPOSITO>你觉得我会是个怎样的父亲
<6-3,ESPOSITO>Hey, what kind of dad do you think I'd be?

151
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,190
<6-4,RYAN>你会是个好爸爸的
<6-4,RYAN>You'd be great.

152
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,440
<6-5,ESPOSITO>即使我自己没有榜样可参照吗
<6-5,ESPOSITO>Even growing up with no role model?

153
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,050
<6-6,RYAN>但问题是
<6-6,RYAN>Well, you know, the thing of it is,

154
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,710
<6-6,RYAN>你知道没有父亲是什么感觉
<6-6,RYAN>is that you know what it's like not having a father.

155
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:44,940
<6-6,RYAN>所以你会确保你的孩子不会跟你一样
<6-6,RYAN>You'd make sure your kid never felt that way.

156
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,170
<6-6,RYAN>你和蕾妮
<6-6,RYAN>You and Lanie...Hmm?

157
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:53,480
<6-7,ESPOSITO>不  她喜欢现状
<6-7,ESPOSITO>No. She likes things how they are.

158
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,170
<6-7,ESPOSITO>但是呢  或许我想要更多了
<6-7,ESPOSITO>But, you know, maybe I'm ready for more than that.

159
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,210
<6-7,ESPOSITO>-你懂吗  关系再向前一步  -明白
<6-7,ESPOSITO>- You know what I'm saying? Move forward. - Huh.

160
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:04,030
<6-9,ESPOSITO>你听见了吗  那声音
<6-9,ESPOSITO>Hey, you hear that? That sound?

161
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,280
<6-9,ESPOSITO>没有  什么声音
<6-9,ESPOSITO>No. What sound?

162
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,120
<6-11,ESPOSITO>我体内的生物钟在走
<6-11,ESPOSITO>It's my biological clock ticking.

163
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,690
<6-11,ESPOSITO>滴答  滴答  滴答
<6-11,ESPOSITO>Tick, tock, tick.

164
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,640
<6-12,RYAN>我们在谈一件很正经的事
<6-12,RYAN>We were having a genuine, honest moment here,

165
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,060
<6-12,RYAN>你个混蛋却毁了一切
<6-12,RYAN>and you had to ruin it by being a jackass.

166
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,670
<6-13,ESPOSITO>慢点慢点
<6-13,ESPOSITO>Hold on, hold on. Slow down, slow down.

167
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,170
<6-14,RYAN>那是杰瑞德·斯通
<6-14,RYAN>That's Jared Stone.

168
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:27,050
<6-15,ESPOSITO>等我一下
<6-15,ESPOSITO>Hang tight here.

169
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:29,120
<6-15,ESPOSITO>我去跟  确保他不会从我们眼皮下消失
<6-15,ESPOSITO>I'll follow him on foot, make sure we don't lose him.

170
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,540
<7-1,ESPOSITO>嘿  兄弟
<7-1,ESPOSITO>Hey, bro.

171
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:46,440
<7-1,ESPOSITO>我跟着他进了地铁
<7-1,ESPOSITO>Yeah, I followed him down to the subway.

172
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,370
<7-1,ESPOSITO>我在找他
<7-1,ESPOSITO>I'm looking for him now.

173
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:48,340
<7-2,RYAN>什么  你跟丢了
<7-2,RYAN>What, you lost him?

174
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:49,310
<7-3,ESPOSITO>不  我没有跟丢
<7-3,ESPOSITO>No, I didn't lose him.

175
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:51,300
<7-3,ESPOSITO>我只是暂时看不到而已
<7-3,ESPOSITO>I just don't have visual contact.

176
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,450
<7-4,RYAN>这有差别吗
<7-4,RYAN>That's kind of splitting hairs, isn't it?

177
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:53,580
<7-4,RYAN>听着  我马上过来
<7-4,RYAN>Look, I-I'll head down there, and --

178
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,360
<7-5,ESPOSITO>不不  你留在车里
<7-5,ESPOSITO>No, no, no. You stay there.

179
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,160
<7-5,ESPOSITO>等等  我看到他  他在我12点方向
<7-5,ESPOSITO>I'll -- wait, I see him. He's at my 12.

180
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,800
<7-5,ESPOSITO>他走得很快
<7-5,ESPOSITO>Yeah, he's moving fast.

181
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,880
<7-5,ESPOSITO>他看起来很慌张  好像有人跟踪他一样
<7-5,ESPOSITO>He's scared, like someone's after him.

182
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,800
<7-6,RYAN>如果是真的  你最好在他们之前找到他
<7-6,RYAN>If someone is, you'd better get to him before they do.

183
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,870
<7-6,RYAN>杀死里夫斯也会对斯通灭口的
<7-6,RYAN>Whoever killed Reeves may be gunning for Stone.

184
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,730
<7-7,ESPOSITO>他上了开往第七大道的车
<7-7,ESPOSITO>He's boarding the 7th Ave. Express.

185
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:12,150
<7-8,ESPOSITO>我跟着斯通上了地铁
<7-8,ESPOSITO>All right, - I'm on the train with Stone.

186
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:19,310
<7-9,OFFICER MARISA ARAGON>你拿着一支没盖盖的马克笔
<7-9,OFFICER MARISA ARAGON>You're holding an uncapped marker,

187
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:22,110
<7-9,OFFICER MARISA ARAGON>你还告诉我你没打算在地铁上乱画吗
<7-9,OFFICER MARISA ARAGON>and you're telling me you were not about to tag this subway car?

188
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,570
<7-10,DUSTIN>对  不是这样的
<7-10,DUSTIN>Yes. I-I mean no.

189
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:26,400
<7-11,ARAGON>出示身份证明
<7-11,ARAGON>I need to see some identification.

190
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,090
<7-11,ARAGON>我得给你开罚单
<7-11,ARAGON>I'm gonna have to write you up for this.

191
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:31,030
<7-12,ESPOSITO>杰瑞德·斯通  你好
<7-12,ESPOSITO>Jared Stone? Hey.

192
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,710
<7-12,ESPOSITO>你没惹上啥事  兄弟
<7-12,ESPOSITO>You're not in trouble, bro, but, uh...

193
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:35,260
<7-12,ESPOSITO>我只是来跟你了解下情况
<7-12,ESPOSITO>Look, I'm just here to talk to you.

194
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:37,590
<7-12,ESPOSITO>别动
<7-12,ESPOSITO>Don't!

195
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:41,690
<7-13,JARED>把你的枪扔地上
<7-13,JARED>Put your gun on the ground!

196
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,440
<7-13,JARED>快
<7-13,JARED>Now!

197
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,670
<7-13,JARED>把你的抢扔地上  快点
<7-13,JARED>Put your gun on the ground now.

198
00:07:58,670 --> 00:07:59,520
<7-14,JARED>快
<7-14,JARED>Do it.

199
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,740
<7-15,JARED>把枪踢到我这边来
<7-15,JARED>Kick it over to me.

200
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:13,890
<7-16,JARED>往后退
<7-16,JARED>Step back.

201
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,760
<7-16,JARED>谁都别动
<7-16,JARED>Nobody else move.

202
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:18,750
<7-17,ESPOSITO>没人动  伙计
<7-17,ESPOSITO>Nobody's moving, man.

203
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,910
<7-17,ESPOSITO>我只是来跟你聊聊   我在你这边
<7-17,ESPOSITO>All right, I just came here to talk to you. I'm on your side.

204
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:24,040
<7-18,JARED>不  你是刀  是权贵的工具
<7-18,JARED>No, you're a blunt instrument, a tool of the one percent.

205
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,360
<7-19,ESPOSITO>听着  现在还没人受伤
<7-19,ESPOSITO>Look, nobody's hurt yet,

206
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,450
<7-19,ESPOSITO>所以我们可以当是误会一场
<7-19,ESPOSITO>so this is - just a big misunderstanding.

207
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:29,270
<7-19,ESPOSITO>你放下枪
<7-19,ESPOSITO>So why don't you lower that weapon,

208
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,880
<7-19,ESPOSITO>我们出去谈谈好吗
<7-19,ESPOSITO>and we can walk right out of here?

209
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,320
<7-20,JARED>-这可能吗  -相信我
<7-20,JARED>- Oh, is that really possible? - It is, yeah.

210
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,290
<7-21,ESPOSITO>你只需要把枪放下  杰瑞德
<7-21,ESPOSITO>You just have to put the gun down, Jared.

211
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:41,720
<7-22,JARED>那是什么  你开着电话
<7-22,JARED>What the hell is that? Are you on the phone?

212
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:46,020
<7-23,JARED>听着  所有人关掉电话  爬下
<7-23,JARED>Everybody, shut off your phones and get the ground now!

213
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:48,160
<7-24,RYAN>哈维  哈维
<7-24,RYAN>Javi! Javi!

223
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:57,700
<8-1,JARED>蹲着  别动  这样就没人会受伤
<8-1,JARED>Stay down, don't move, and nobody gets hurt.

224
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,100
<8-2,BELLA>这不可能是真的
<8-2,BELLA>This cannot be happening.

225
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:06,140
<8-3,TY>别这样好吗
<8-3,TY>Please, look, don't do this.

226
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:06,970
<8-3,TY>别伤害我妻子
<8-3,TY>Okay? Don't hurt my wife.

227
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:09,250
<8-4,GRANT GERBER>还有我们
<8-4,GRANT GERBER>Or the rest of us. Let's be inclusive.

228
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,970
<8-5,ESPOSITO>所有人保持冷静  别紧张
<8-5,ESPOSITO>Hey, everybody just stay calm, all right?

229
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:12,850
<8-5,ESPOSITO>我们会没事的
<8-5,ESPOSITO>We're all gonna be fine.

230
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,960
<8-6,JARED>听着  这里我说了算  不是你
<8-6,JARED>Look, you're not in charge. I am.

231
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,070
<8-6,JARED>我拉了紧急刹车
<8-6,JARED>Hey, I pulled the emergency brake.

232
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:22,040
<8-6,JARED>为什么列车长还没发起通话
<8-6,JARED>Why hasn't the conductor come over the intercom yet?

233
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,480
<8-7,ESPOSITO>-也许他   -闭嘴
<8-7,ESPOSITO>- Well, maybe he--  - shh!

234
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,510
<8-8,JARED>你感觉到了吗  有人在动
<8-8,JARED>You feel that? That's movement.

235
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:31,210
<8-8,JARED>像是乘客在紧急疏散
<8-8,JARED>Like people are getting off the train, e-evacuating.

236
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,290
<8-8,JARED>他们怎么知道的
<8-8,JARED>How do they know?

237
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,810
<8-8,JARED>你刚才在跟谁打电话
<8-8,JARED>Who were you on the phone with?

238
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:37,010
<8-9,ESPOSITO>一个朋友而已
<8-9,ESPOSITO>Just a friend, man.

239
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:40,100
<8-10,JARED>什么朋友  也是个警察吗
<8-10,JARED>Oh, what kind of friend? Was it another cop?

240
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,020
<8-10,JARED>是警察吗
<8-10,JARED>Was it a cop, huh?

241
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,760
<8-10,JARED>有必要的话我可以重拨
<8-10,JARED>I can hit redial if I want.

242
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,530
<8-11,ESPOSITO>是  他也是纽约警局的  但那不代表什么
<8-11,ESPOSITO>Yeah, he was a -- he was NYPD, but that doesn't mean anything.

243
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:47,060
<8-12,JARED>闭嘴
<8-12,JARED>Okay, shut up.

244
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,700
<8-12,JARED>所有人都闭嘴  好吧
<8-12,JARED>Okay, everybody just stop talking, okay?

245
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,200
<8-12,JARED>我得想想
<8-12,JARED>I got to...Think.

246
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:55,080
<8-13,ARAGON>他拿走了我的配枪
<8-13,ARAGON>He took my service weapon.

247
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:57,060
<8-13,ARAGON>我怎么能让他得逞
<8-13,ARAGON>How did I let him do that?

248
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,660
<8-14,ESPOSITO>这事可能发生在任何人身上  好吗
<8-14,ESPOSITO>Hey, it could happen to anybody, okay?

249
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:05,210
<8-14,ESPOSITO>我是哈维尔·埃斯波西托
<8-14,ESPOSITO>I'm Javier, Javier Esposito.

250
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,830

<8-15,ARAGON>Marisa Aragon.

251
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:08,270
<8-15,ARAGON>杰瑞德
<8-15,ARAGON>Jared?

252
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:10,160
<8-16,GERBER>我能叫你杰瑞德吗
<8-16,GERBER>May I call you Jared?

253
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:14,630
<8-16,GERBER>我是格兰特·格博  推销员  我很善于倾听
<8-16,GERBER>Grant Gerber, salesman by trade, which means I'm a listener.

254
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:18,420
<8-16,GERBER>我会倾听并理解人们的需求  好满足他们
<8-16,GERBER>I listen and learn what people want so I can give it to them.

255

<8-16,GERBER>我来帮你吧  杰瑞德
<8-16,GERBER>Let me do that for you, Jared.

256
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:23,680
<8-16,GERBER>我想帮你得偿所愿
<8-16,GERBER>I want to help you get what you want.

257
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,330
<8-17,JARED>你会有机会的
<8-17,JARED>I think you'll get your chance.

258
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,820
<9-1,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>我刚得知杰瑞德·斯通
<9-1,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>I've just been informed that Jared Stone,

259
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:34,200
<9-1,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>一个保罗·里夫斯案件的嫌疑人
<9-1,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>a person of interest in the Paul Reeves case,

260
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,740
<9-1,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>在地铁持枪挟持了人质
<9-1,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>drew a gun on a subway and took hostages,

261
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:39,030
<9-1,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>包括埃斯波西托警探
<9-1,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>including detective Esposito.

262
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,620
<9-1,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>目前还不清楚他为什么...
<9-1,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>At this point, it's not clear why...

263
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:43,020
<9-2,CASTLE>要说有谁能应付这种事  埃斯波绝对行
<9-2,CASTLE>Hey, if anybody can handle it, Espo can.

264
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,270
<9-2,CASTLE>也不知道他有什么打算
<9-2,CASTLE>...or what his agenda is...

265
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,810
<9-2,CASTLE>可斯通为什么要挟持人质
<9-2,CASTLE>But why would Stone take hostages?

266
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:48,560
<9-3,GATES>现在我们的首要目标就是
<9-3,GATES>Right now our sole priority is to gather any

267
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:50,900
<9-3,GATES>尽可能收集杰瑞德·斯通的相关信息
<9-3,GATES>and all information on Jared Stone

268
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,370
<9-3,GATES>以便人质救援小组
<9-3,GATES>so the hostage-rescue team

269
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:54,070
<9-3,GATES>了解对方的底细
<9-3,GATES>will know who we're dealing with.

270
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:58,170
<9-3,GATES>所有情报都给我  我会直接转达给人质救援小组
<9-3,GATES>All intel comes to me so that I can forward it directly to HRT.

271
00:10:58,170 --> 00:10:59,830
<9-3,GATES>他们现在应该到现场了
<9-3,GATES>They should be on the scene right now.

272
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,660
<10-1,CAPTAIN BIGALOW>-莱恩警探吗  -是的  长官
<10-1,CAPTAIN BIGALOW>- Detective Ryan? - Yes, sir.

273
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,250
<10-2,RYAN>我是比格罗队长  人质救援小组的
<10-2,RYAN>Captain Bigelow, HRT.

274
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,470
<10-3,BIGALOW>有什么疑犯的信息
<10-3,BIGALOW>What's your intel on your suspect?

275
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,060
<10-4,RYAN>长官  他是个黑客  是占领华尔街运动的激进分子
<10-4,RYAN>Sir, he's a hacker, an occupy wall street activist.

276
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:11,720
<10-4,RYAN>都是些笼统的信息
<10-4,RYAN>It's all sketchy.

277
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,170
<10-5,BIGALOW>你们的人埃斯波西托呢  我们能指望他吗
<10-5,BIGALOW>What about your boy Esposito? Is he someone we can count on?

278
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:16,020
<10-6,RYAN>-他可靠吗  -他非常可靠
<10-6,RYAN>- He's solid? - He's as solid as they get.

279
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:16,980
<10-7,BIGALOW>明白
<10-7,BIGALOW>Roger that.

280
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:21,910
<10-8,RYAN>贝克特  我很抱歉
<10-8,RYAN>Hey, Beckett. I'm sorry.

281
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,840
<10-9,BECKETT>凯文  没人能预见到这种事
<10-9,BECKETT>Kevin, no one could have seen this coming.

282
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,050
<10-10,RYAN>不不  他是我的搭档
<10-10,RYAN>No, no, he's my partner.

283
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:26,580
<10-10,RYAN>我就不该让他一个人进去
<10-10,RYAN>I should have never let him go in there alone.

284
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:28,820
<10-11,BECKETT>我们得集中精力把哈维救出来
<10-11,BECKETT>We got to focus on getting Javi out of there,

285
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:32,610
<10-11,BECKETT>你跟救援组简报完就直接去斯通的公寓
<10-11,BECKETT>So once you brief HRT, just head over to Stone's apartment.

286
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:33,380
<10-12,RYAN>离开现场吗
<10-12,RYAN>Leave the scene?

287
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:36,150
<10-13,BECKETT>你能做的救援小组都已经在做了
<10-13,BECKETT>There's nothing that you can do that HRT isn't already doing.

288
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,920
<10-13,BECKETT>如果我们想救出哈维
<10-13,BECKETT>And if we want to help javi out,

289
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,140
<10-13,BECKETT>那我们能做的最大努力
<10-13,BECKETT>then the best thing that we can do

290
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:41,940
<10-13,BECKETT>就是查明杰瑞德·斯通的身份和动机
<10-13,BECKETT>is find out who Jared Stone is and why he is doing this,

291
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,120
<10-13,BECKETT>而线索很可能就在他的公寓里
<10-13,BECKETT>and some of those answers might be at his apartment.

292
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:47,470
<10-14,RYAN>好吧  我会去查查  有消息通知你
<10-14,RYAN>Okay. I'll check it out and let you know.

293
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:52,250
<11-1,LANIE>凯特  他们说的是真的吗
<11-1,LANIE>Kate, is it true -- what they're saying?

294
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:54,710
<11-2,BECKETT>听着  他经历过比这更糟的情况
<11-2,BECKETT>Listen, he has been - in worse scrapes than this,

295
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,940
<11-2,BECKETT>我们会救出他的  我保证
<11-2,BECKETT>and we're gonna get him out of there, I promise you.

296
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,490
<11-3,GATES>贝克特探长  帕里什医生
<11-3,GATES>Detective Beckett, Dr. Parish,

297
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:01,370
<11-3,GATES>我们看到埃斯波西托了
<11-3,GATES>we've got eyes on Esposito.

298
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:11,450
<11-3,GATES>这镜头是哪来的
<11-3,GATES>Where's this coming from?

299
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:14,330
<11-3,GATES>交管局应该没在地铁车辆上安装摄像头啊
<11-3,GATES>I didn't think the MTA had cameras in the subway cars.

300
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:14,900
<12-1,BECKETT>是没有
<12-1,BECKETT>They don't.

301
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:17,690
<12-2,TORY>这辆列车是安装安保监控的试点车辆
<12-2,TORY>The train is part of a pilot program for video security.

302
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:18,820
<12-3,BECKETT>在一个独立的信号
<12-3,BECKETT>This is on a separate feed,

303
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,620
<12-2,TORY>所以我花了点时间才找到
<12-2,TORY>So it took me awhile to find it.

304
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,030
<12-3,BECKETT>等等  如果这是独立的信号
<12-3,BECKETT>Wait, if this is on a separate feed...

305
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:24,310
<12-4,CASTLE>那就意味着我们能看到斯通  而他并不知道
<12-4,CASTLE>that means that we can see Stone, but he doesn't know that.

306
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,880
<12-5,GATES>那我们就有战术优势了
<12-5,GATES>Which gives us a tactical edge.

307
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,120
<12-5,GATES>我会确保救援小组知道这一情况
<12-5,GATES>I'll make sure HRT knows about this.

308
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:29,720
<12-6,LANIE>起码哈维不是一个人在面对
<12-6,LANIE>At least Javi's not down there alone.

309
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,060
<12-6,LANIE>还有个警察跟他一起
<12-6,LANIE>There's another cop with him.

310
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:31,940
<12-7,BECKETT>是啊  有他俩在
<12-7,BECKETT>Yeah, between the two of them,

311
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:34,170
<12-7,BECKETT>他们或许能缓和局面
<12-7,BECKETT>they might be able to diffuse the situation.

312
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:42,940
<13-1,ARAGON>他现在听音乐有点奇怪吧
<13-1,ARAGON>Kind of a weird time for him to be hitting his playlist.

313
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,630
<13-2,ESPOSITO>他是想让自己镇定下来
<13-2,ESPOSITO>He's trying to calm himself down.

314
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,840
<13-3,ARAGON>镇定下来要做什么
<13-3,ARAGON>Because he's about to do what?

315
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:51,140
<13-4,ESPOSITO>我可能需要你帮忙
<13-4,ESPOSITO>I might need you to back me up.

316
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,120
<13-4,ESPOSITO>你能行吗
<13-4,ESPOSITO>Can you do that?

317
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,330
<13-5,ARAGON>你有什么打算
<13-5,ARAGON>What's your play?

318
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:59,130
<13-6,ESPOSITO>跟他聊天  试着让他觉悟
<13-6,ESPOSITO>Talk to him, try to get him to see the light,

319
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:00,690
<13-6,ESPOSITO>如果有机会就卸下他的武器
<13-6,ESPOSITO>then disarm him if I get the chance.

320
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:03,870
<13-7,ARAGON>我去吧  穿警服的可是我
<13-7,ARAGON>I should talk to him. I'm the one wearing the kevlar.

321
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:06,370
<13-8,ESPOSITO>是  但我已经跟他搭过话了
<13-8,ESPOSITO>Yeah, but I've already got a rapport with the guy, so...

322
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,300
<13-9,ARAGON>那话可没搭好
<13-9,ARAGON>A bad rapport.

323
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:11,520
<13-9,ARAGON>我知道你什么意思  我只是个运输警
<13-9,ARAGON>I know what this is. I'm just a transit cop.

324
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:12,950
<13-9,ARAGON>你们这些警察
<13-9,ARAGON>You gold-shield guys,

325
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:14,770
<13-9,ARAGON>总觉得你们比我们强
<13-9,ARAGON>always acting like you're better than us.

326
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:16,030
<13-10,ESPOSITO>我们的确比你们强
<13-10,ESPOSITO>We are better than you.

327
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,350
<13-11,ESPOSITO>斯通先生
<13-11,ESPOSITO>Mr. Stone?!

328
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,340
<13-11,ESPOSITO>我能说话吗
<13-11,ESPOSITO>Permission to speak?

329
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,170
<13-12,JARED>说吧
<13-12,JARED>Go ahead.

330
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,350
<13-13,JARED>别再靠近了
<13-13,JARED>That is far enough.

331
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:40,950
<13-14,ESPOSITO>听着  不管你跟保罗·里夫斯之间发生了什么
<13-14,ESPOSITO>Look, whatever went down between you and Paul Reeves,

332
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:43,330
<13-14,ESPOSITO>这样只会让事情更糟
<13-14,ESPOSITO>this is only gonna make it worse.

333
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:46,620
<13-15,JARED>本来不该这样的  起码不是在这里
<13-15,JARED>This wasn't supposed to happen -- not here.

334
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:49,160
<13-15,JARED>这并非计划中的事
<13-15,JARED>This wasn't part of the plan.

335
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,940
<13-16,ESPOSITO>那我们可以想个新的计划
<13-16,ESPOSITO>Then we can come up with a new plan,

336
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:53,160
<13-16,ESPOSITO>能让你安全离开这里的计划
<13-16,ESPOSITO>one where you walk out of here.

337
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:54,790
<13-16,ESPOSITO>现在还来得及
<13-16,ESPOSITO>You can still do that.

338
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:57,240
<13-17,JARED>来不及了
<13-17,JARED>It's too late.

339
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:58,560
<13-17,JARED>警方已经介入了
<13-17,JARED>Police are already involved.

340
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,870
<13-17,JARED>我知道没有回头路了
<13-17,JARED>It -- I know there's no turning back.

341
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,320
<13-18,ESPOSITO>你必须回头  杰瑞德
<13-18,ESPOSITO>You have to turn back, Jared,

342
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:03,960
<13-18,ESPOSITO>你要是不回头  我跟你说说后果
<13-18,ESPOSITO>'cause if you don't, - here's what's gonna happen.

343
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,190
<13-18,ESPOSITO>HRT  也就是人质救援小组
<13-18,ESPOSITO>HRT -- that's the hostage rescue team --

344
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:08,520
<13-18,ESPOSITO>会跟你僵持到你开始疲软
<13-18,ESPOSITO>Will wait for you to get weak and tired,

345
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:12,140
<13-18,ESPOSITO>然后十多个训练有素  全副武装的家伙
<13-18,ESPOSITO>then a dozen highly trained guys armed to the teeth

346
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,470
<13-18,ESPOSITO>会冲进这辆车
<13-18,ESPOSITO>Will breach this car.

347
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:17,120
<13-18,ESPOSITO>相信我  他们可不是闹着玩的
<13-18,ESPOSITO>And trust me when I tell you... They will not play.

348
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,070
<13-18,ESPOSITO>你能一枪殒命就算运气好了
<13-18,ESPOSITO>You'll be lucky to get off one shot before they drop you.

349
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:23,520
<13-19,JARED>HRT不会靠近我的
<13-19,JARED>HRT won't come near me...

350
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:27,300
<13-19,JARED>只要他们知道我有这个
<13-19,JARED>...Not once they know I have this.

351
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:42,810
<14-1,LANIE>天啊  人肉炸弹背心
<14-1,LANIE>Oh, my god, a suicide vest.

352
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:45,940
<14-2,GATES>他左手  那是失知触动装置
<14-2,GATES>His left hand. That's a dead man's switch.

353
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:47,620
<14-2,GATES>如果他松手...
<14-2,GATES>If he lets go of that...

354
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:53,330
<14-3,CASTLE>很明显  杰瑞德·斯通不是告密者
<14-3,CASTLE>Clearly, Jared Stone is not a whistle-blower.

355
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:56,010
<14-4,BECKETT>他是个身穿炸弹背心的恐怖分子
<14-4,BECKETT>He's a terrorist wearing an explosive vest.

356
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:57,290
<14-4,BECKETT>这是一场有预谋的袭击
<14-4,BECKETT>This was a planned attack.

357
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:59,470
<14-5,GATES>我会联系国安局  看他们有什么信息
<14-5,GATES>I'll contact Homeland, see what they have on him.

358
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:01,370
<14-5,GATES>继续调查杰瑞德·斯通
<14-5,GATES>Keep working intel on Jared Stone.

359
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:05,030
<14-5,GATES>显然他不是我们想的那样
<14-5,GATES>Obviously, the man is not at all who we thought he was.

360
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:08,380
<15-1,ESPOSITO>杰瑞德  你在干什么
<15-1,ESPOSITO>Jared, what are you doing, man?

361
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,420
<15-2,JARED>不用我解释吧  不是吗
<15-2,JARED>It's kind of self-explanatory, isn't it?

362
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,150
<15-3,ESPOSITO>我知道你是激进分子
<15-3,ESPOSITO>Look, I know you're an activist

363
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,680
<15-3,ESPOSITO>你全力抵抗权贵阶级
<15-3,ESPOSITO>and you're all about taking on the one percent,

364
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:15,660
<15-3,ESPOSITO>你看这里有那样的人吗
<15-3,ESPOSITO>but do you see anybody like that here?

365
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,680
<15-4,GERBER>我虽是个推销员
<15-4,GERBER>Look, I may be a salesman,

366
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,170
<15-4,GERBER>但是你要知道  我赚得并不多
<15-4,GERBER>but just so you know, I'm not a big earner.

367
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:22,910
<15-4,GERBER>我只是勉强度日
<15-4,GERBER>Okay, I am barely scraping by.

368
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:26,220
<15-5,ESPOSITO>杰瑞德  这些都是跟你一样辛勤工作的人
<15-5,ESPOSITO>Jared, these are - working people -- your people.

369
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,150
<15-5,ESPOSITO>你不希望伤害他们的
<15-5,ESPOSITO>You don't want to hurt them.

370
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:34,860
<15-6,JARED>你说得对  我不想
<15-6,JARED>You're right. I don't.

371
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,750
<15-6,JARED>但如果迫不得以  我会的
<15-6,JARED>But I will if I have to.

372
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:45,680
<15-7,JARED>拍张照片  发给人质救援小组
<15-7,JARED>Take a picture. Text it to HRT.

373
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,400
<16-1,RYAN>告诉我你知道的关于杰瑞德·斯通的所有事
<16-1,RYAN>I need you to tell me everything you know about Jared Stone.

374
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,410
<16-2,LANDLORD>只知道他只租两周
<16-2,LANDLORD>Just that he wanted the apartment for two weeks,

375
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,480
<16-2,LANDLORD>所以我租给他了
<16-2,LANDLORD>so I rented it to him.

376
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,710
<16-3,RYAN>你见过他吗  跟他说过话吗
<16-3,RYAN>Did you meet the guy, talk to him?

377
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:55,900
<16-4,LANDLORD>给钥匙的时候见过一次
<16-4,LANDLORD>Just when I gave him the key

378
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,300
<16-4,LANDLORD>我告诉他这里不允许开狂野派对
<16-4,LANDLORD>and told him I did not permit wild parties.

379
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,460
<16-5,LANDLORD>发生什么事了
<16-5,LANDLORD>What's this about?

380
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,230
<16-6,RYAN>搜查这里每一个角落
<16-6,RYAN>All right, comb through every inch of this place.

381
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,820
<16-6,RYAN>检查他所有的文件  个人物品
<16-6,RYAN>Look through all his papers, personal items,

382
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:05,280
<16-6,RYAN>任何信息  所有关于他身份和目的的线索
<16-6,RYAN>anything that can tell us who Jared Stone is or what he's up to.

383
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:06,000
<16-7,LANDLORD>抱歉  先生们
<16-7,LANDLORD>E-excuse me, gentlemen,

384
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,130
<16-7,LANDLORD>能要求你们把鞋脱掉吗
<16-7,LANDLORD>but could I ask you to remove your shoes?

385
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:12,310
<16-7,LANDLORD>地毯是新买的  只是说说
<16-7,LANDLORD>The carpet is brand-new. Just a thought.

386
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:13,690
<16-9,RYAN>谢谢你
<16-9,RYAN>Thank you.

387
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:16,270
<17-1,GATES>国安局没有关于杰瑞德·斯通的文件
<17-1,GATES>Homeland doesn't have a file on Jared Stone.

388
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,960
<17-1,GATES>纽约警局的反恐档案里也没有
<17-1,GATES>Neither does NYPD counter-terrorism.

389
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,100
<17-2,CASTLE>斯通为什么要炸地铁
<17-2,CASTLE>Why would Stone blow up the subway?

390
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,420
<17-2,CASTLE>我在读他关于收入不平等的文章
<17-2,CASTLE>I-I-I've been reading his posts on income inequality.

391
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:26,840
<17-2,CASTLE>他有点迂腐  但只是纸上谈兵
<17-2,CASTLE>He's a little pedantic, but he's an armchair revolutionary.

392
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,820
<17-2,CASTLE>他并不是一个行动派
<17-2,CASTLE>He's not a man of action.

393
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,520
<17-3,GATES>也许有什么事让他变得激进了
<17-3,GATES>Maybe he became radicalized somehow.

394
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,250
<17-4,CASTLE>上演"地铁惊魂"不可能是他的计划
<17-4,CASTLE>"The taking of Pelham 123" could not have been his plan.

395
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,630
<17-4,CASTLE>他肯定是准备去什么地方
<17-4,CASTLE>He must have been headed someplace else

396
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:34,540
<17-4,CASTLE>埃斯波西托挡住了他的路
<17-4,CASTLE>when Esposito stopped him.

397
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:35,410
<17-4,CASTLE>没错
<17-4,CASTLE>He was.

398
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:37,860
<17-5,BECKETT>斯通准备去参加一个财富管理研讨会
<17-5,BECKETT>Stone was set to attend a wealth-management seminar

399
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,610
<17-5,BECKETT>有1500人参加  在特里梅因酒店举行
<17-5,BECKETT>with 1,500 people at the Tremaine Hotel.

400
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:42,990
<17-5,BECKETT>他准备去那里  可是埃斯波西托出现了
<17-5,BECKETT>That's where he was going when Esposito came along.

401
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:45,320
<17-6,GATES>七号线正好可以到达那里
<17-6,GATES>The 7th avenue express would have taken him right there.

402
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,040
<17-6,GATES>如果他是要对付权贵
<17-6,GATES>And if he was after one-percenters,

403
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,150
<17-6,GATES>这研讨会可满满都是目标
<17-6,GATES>this seminar would be a target-rich environment.

404
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,640
<17-7,BECKETT>长官  他还有个后备目标
<17-7,BECKETT>Sir, he also had a backup target.

405
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,790
<17-7,BECKETT>他订了一张歌剧的票
<17-7,BECKETT>He had seats to an opera

406
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,580
<17-7,BECKETT>在百老汇最大的剧院  有1900个座位
<17-7,BECKETT>at the biggest theater on Broadway -- 1,900 seats.

407
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,510
<17-8,GATES>他想要的是大规模伤亡
<17-8,GATES>He was going for maximum casualties,

408
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:59,090
<17-8,GATES>而且想要与这些人同归于尽
<17-8,GATES>and he's willing to kill himself in the process.

409
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,560
<17-8,GATES>我把这些转告人质救援小组  还有一件事
<17-8,GATES>I'll pass this on to HRT. Oh, uh, one more thing.

410
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,760
<17-8,GATES>托瑞查了那个投币电话
<17-8,GATES>Tory ran video on that pay phone.

411
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,520
<17-8,GATES>斯通以前用过
<17-8,GATES>Stone did use it before.

412
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,910
<17-8,GATES>他上周往马尔代夫打过两次电话
<17-8,GATES>He called the Maldives last week twice.

413
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:09,800
<17-9,CASTLE>马尔代夫
<17-9,CASTLE>The Maldives?

414
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,060
<17-10,BECKETT>他打电话给谁
<17-10,BECKETT>Who was he talking to?

415
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,610
<17-11,GATES>他打的那个手机已经停用了
<17-11,GATES>The cellphone he has is no longer active.

416
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:14,860
<17-11,GATES>追踪不到
<17-11,GATES>Can't track it down.

417
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,620
<17-11,GATES>盖茨
<17-11,GATES>Gates.

418
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,400
<17-11,GATES>人质救援小组那面问
<17-11,GATES>HRT is asking,

419
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,910
<17-11,GATES>"埃斯波西托喜欢什么味的披萨"
<17-11,GATES>"What kind of pizza does detective Esposito like?"

420
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:28,810
<17-12,BECKETT>菠萝  橄榄  双份墨西哥胡椒  长官
<17-12,BECKETT>Uh, uh, pineapple, olives, and, uh, double jalapeno, sir.

421
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:31,420
<17-13,GATES>我会转达的  菠萝
<17-13,GATES>I'll pass it along. Uh...Pineapple...

422
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,130
<17-14,CASTLE>作为一个黑客
<17-14,CASTLE>Since when does a hacker,

423
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:36,670
<17-14,CASTLE>他应该是生活在网上
<17-14,CASTLE>who by his very nature tends to live his life virtually,

424
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,170
<17-14,CASTLE>怎么会变成人肉炸弹客了呢
<17-14,CASTLE>morph into a suicide bomber?

425
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:40,500
<17-14,CASTLE>斯通没有暴力史
<17-14,CASTLE>Stone has no history of violence.

426
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,890
<17-15,BECKETT>你认为有什么事触动了他吗
<17-15,BECKETT>You think something happened to trigger him?

427
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,290
<17-16,CASTLE>我不知道  但是这里似乎漏掉了什么
<17-16,CASTLE>I don't know, but there's a piece missing here somewhere.

428
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:47,140
<17-16,CASTLE>总审计局的调查员与这事什么关系
<17-16,CASTLE>H-how does a G.A.O. Investigator fit into this?

429
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,970
<17-16,CASTLE>打去马尔代夫的电话
<17-16,CASTLE>The calls to the Maldives?

430
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,760
<17-16,CASTLE>莱恩那面有消息吗
<17-16,CASTLE>Has Ryan turned anything up?

431
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,470
<17-17,BECKETT>目前为止还没有
<17-17,BECKETT>No, so far, no word.

433
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:05,730
<17-17,BECKETT>请问一下
<17-17,BECKETT>Excuse me.

434
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,800
<18-1,RYAN>这张两天前的碎纸机收据
<18-1,RYAN>This receipt from two days ago for the shredder --

435
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,350
<18-1,RYAN>-是你买的吗  -不是
<18-1,RYAN>- Did you buy it? - No.

436
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:13,200
<18-2,LANDLORD>我不知道从哪来的
<18-2,LANDLORD>I don't even know where that came from.

437
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,830
<18-2,LANDLORD>和这里不搭
<18-2,LANDLORD>It really doesn't fit.

438
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,760
<18-3,RYAN>是斯通买的
<18-3,RYAN>Then Stone bought it.

439
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:19,740
<18-3,RYAN>不好意思  你能...
<18-3,RYAN>Excuse me. Could you...

440
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:25,080
<18-4,RYAN>他在粉碎文件
<18-4,RYAN>He's shredding documents.

441
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,080
<18-4,RYAN>把这些都装起来
<18-4,RYAN>Okay, we need to bag this up

442
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,090
<18-4,RYAN>带回分局去
<18-4,RYAN>and take it back to the precinct,

443
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:30,390
<18-4,RYAN>把它们拼起来  找出斯通在隐藏什么
<18-4,RYAN>put it back together, find out what Stone was trying to hide.

444
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,580
<19-1,JARED>你是怎么找到我的
<19-1,JARED>So, how did you find me?

445
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,340
<19-1,JARED>你怎么追踪到我的
<19-1,JARED>How did you track me down?

446
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,410
<19-2,JARED>你知道白色骑士吗
<19-2,JARED>Do you know about white knight?

447
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,780
<19-3,ESPOSITO>什么白色骑士
<19-3,ESPOSITO>What's white knight?

448
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:55,320
<19-4,ESPOSITO>肯定是谈判专家
<19-4,ESPOSITO>That'll be the negotiator.

449
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:59,020
<19-4,ESPOSITO>你有所需求  不是吗
<19-4,ESPOSITO>You want something, right?

450
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,600
<19-4,ESPOSITO>现在是你提出要求的时候了
<19-4,ESPOSITO>Now would be the time to ask for it.

451
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,800
<19-5,JARED>你好

<19-5,JARED>Yeah, yeah, th-th-they're all fine, too.

456
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:25,990
<19-5,JARED>我问一下  谁饿了吗
<19-5,JARED>Uh, let me ask. Is, uh, anybody hungry?

457
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:27,980
<19-7,GERBER>-我总在饿  -我也是
<19-7,GERBER>- I'm always hungry. - So am I.

<19-8,JARED>Well, you do that, Bob.

461
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:42,830
<19-8,JARED>需求
<19-8,JARED>Demands.

462
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:47,570
<19-8,JARED>我有需求吗
<19-8,JARED>Do I have demands?

463
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:49,730
<19-8,JARED>是的
<19-8,JARED>Yeah.

464
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:51,670
<19-8,JARED>我有一个
<19-8,JARED>I got one.

465
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,140
<19-8,JARED>你在听吗
<19-8,JARED>You listening?

466
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:58,050
<19-8,JARED>我要监狱释放艾伦·威尔逊
<19-8,JARED>I want Aaron Wilson released from prison.

467
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:02,220
<19-8,JARED>有了完成此事的计划再给我回电
<19-8,JARED>You call me back when you have a plan to make that happen.

468
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:05,830
<20-1,BECKETT>这就完了
<20-1,BECKETT>That's all he said?

469
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,250
<20-2,CASTLE>艾伦·威尔逊又是谁啊
<20-2,CASTLE>Who the hell is Aaron Wilson?

470
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:10,470
<20-3,GATES>如果我们想救这些人  就得找出答案
<20-3,GATES>Well, if we want to save these people, we need to find out.

471
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:15,160
<20-3,GATES>查查艾伦·威尔逊是谁吧
<20-3,GATES>Okay, let's find who this Aaron Wilson is.

473
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:20,840
<21-1,BECKETT>等等
<21-1,BECKETT>Wait a minute.

474
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,400
<21-2,BECKETT>卡塞尔  是个女人  是艾琳
<21-2,BECKETT>Castle, it's a woman -- E-R-I-N.

475
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:28,810
<21-2,BECKETT>她因为电脑侵入重罪
<21-2,BECKETT>She's serving seven years in federal prison

476
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:31,250
<21-2,BECKETT>被判入狱服刑七年
<21-2,BECKETT>for felony computer trespassing.

477
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,430
<21-3,CASTLE>她也是个黑客
<21-3,CASTLE>So she's a hacker, too.

478
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:34,470
<21-4,BECKETT>庭审记录说她入侵了
<21-4,BECKETT>Court records show that she hacked a database

479
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:36,030
<21-4,BECKETT>纽约美联储的数据库
<21-4,BECKETT>at the New York Federal Reserve,

480
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:38,650
<21-4,BECKETT>寻找美联储和各大银行勾结的证据
<21-4,BECKETT>looking for proof that the Fed colluded with the big banks.

481
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:39,980
<21-5,CASTLE>她和斯通什么关系呢
<21-5,CASTLE>What's her connection to Stone?

482
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,630
<21-6,BECKETT>杰瑞德·斯通好像是从犯
<21-6,BECKETT>It looks like Jared Stone was an accomplice,

483
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:46,540
<21-6,BECKETT>但美国检察院没有足够证据起诉他
<21-6,BECKETT>but the U.S. Attorney didn't have enough to charge him.

484
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,720
<21-7,CASTLE>他们是犯罪伙伴
<21-7,CASTLE>So they were partners in crime.

485
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,920
<21-7,CASTLE>艾琳进了监狱  斯通却没有
<21-7,CASTLE>Erin went to prison, Stone didn't.

486
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,020
<21-7,CASTLE>所以他想救她出来
<21-7,CASTLE>That's why he wants to get her out.

487
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,110
<21-7,CASTLE>他觉得愧疚
<21-7,CASTLE>He feels guilty.

488
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,140
<21-7,CASTLE>这也解释了打去马尔代夫的电话
<21-7,CASTLE>That would also explain the Maldives.

489
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,400
<21-9,CASTLE>-什么意思  -一个无引渡条约的国家
<21-9,CASTLE>- What do you mean? - It's a non-extradition country.

490
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,260
<21-10,RYAN>两位  过来看看这个
<21-10,RYAN>Hey, guys, you need to see this.

491
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:02,440
<22-1,RYAN>碎纸机里大概有两页文本
<22-1,RYAN>What was in that shredder was about two pages of text.

492
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:04,660
<22-1,RYAN>目前为止  我们只拼出了几个零碎的词
<22-1,RYAN>So far, we've been able to assemble a few random words,

493
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,480
<22-1,RYAN>有监视器  监控
<22-1,RYAN>like "Monitor" And "Surveillance."

494
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,410
<22-2,BECKETT>那你觉得这是什么
<22-2,BECKETT>Okay, what do you think it is?

495
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:08,530
<22-3,RYAN>好像是封信
<22-3,RYAN>It's some kind of letter,

496
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:10,560
<22-3,RYAN>但我觉得不是斯通写的
<22-3,RYAN>but I don't think that Stone was the one who wrote it.

497
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,810
<22-3,RYAN>看看我们刚拼出的这个句子
<22-3,RYAN>Take a look at this phrase that we assembled just now.

498
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:17,470
<22-4,BECKETT>阅读  记忆  然后销毁
<22-4,BECKETT>"Read, memorize, and then destroy"?

499
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:19,110
<22-5,RYAN>应该不是他写给自己的
<22-5,RYAN>It's not like he would write that to himself.

500
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:20,300
<22-6,CASTLE>所以这是指令
<22-6,CASTLE>So they're instructions.

501
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,140
<22-6,CASTLE>现在我们知道斯通还有同谋
<22-6,CASTLE>Now we know Stone - is working with other people.

502
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:24,060
<22-6,CASTLE>也许这些都与艾琳·威尔逊有关
<22-6,CASTLE>Maybe this is all about Erin Wilson.

503
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,750
<22-6,CASTLE>也许她就是幕后主使
<22-6,CASTLE>Maybe she's the one behind all this.

504
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:28,410
<22-7,BECKETT>卡塞尔和我会跟进深入调查艾琳·威尔逊
<22-7,BECKETT>Castle and I will look into Erin Wilson and dig deeper,

505
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:30,440
<22-7,BECKETT>也会找找杰瑞德还有没有
<22-7,BECKETT>and we'll also see if we can identify any associates

506
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,560
<22-7,BECKETT>其他已知同伙
<22-7,BECKETT>that Jared might have had.

507
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,730
<22-8,RYAN>我们会继续拼这个
<22-8,RYAN>We'll keep piecing this together here.

508
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:35,010
<22-9,BECKETT>伙计们  被劫持的人都指望着我们呢
<22-9,BECKETT>Guys, everyone down there is counting on us.

509
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:41,890
<23-1,ESPOSITO>艾琳·威尔逊是谁
<23-1,ESPOSITO>Who's Erin Wilson?

510
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:46,950
<23-2,JARED>我的灵魂伴侣
<23-2,JARED>She's my soul mate.

511
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:50,120
<23-3,ESPOSITO>你应该多给鲍勃提供点信息
<23-3,ESPOSITO>Well, why not give Bob more to go on

512
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,680
<23-3,ESPOSITO>好让他知道你说的是谁
<23-3,ESPOSITO>so he knew who you were talking about?

513
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:55,010
<23-4,JARED>不想让他知道太多  我要控制局面
<23-4,JARED>I want to keep him off-balance, maintain control.

514
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:56,280
<23-5,ESPOSITO>你这是网上看来的建议吗
<23-5,ESPOSITO>You get that tip off the internet?

515
00:21:57,170 --> 00:21:58,520
<23-5,ESPOSITO>这建议真烂
<23-5,ESPOSITO>'Cause it's not a very good one.

516
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:04,910
<23-6,ESPOSITO>白色骑士是什么
<23-6,ESPOSITO>What's White Knight?

517
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,100
<23-7,JARED>告诉我你释放艾琳的计划
<23-7,JARED>Tell me your plan for Erin.

518
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:26,640
<23-7,JARED>你怎么用了这么久  鲍勃
<23-7,JARED>What the hell is taking so long, Bob?

519
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:30,230
<23-7,JARED>抓她进监狱  可比放出来快多了
<23-7,JARED>Getting her in prison didn't seem to take any time at all!

520
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,630
<8-11,ESPOSITO>鲍勃  闭嘴
<8-11,ESPOSITO>D-- Bob, shut up!

521
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:34,400
<8-12,JARED>闭嘴
<8-12,JARED>Shut up!

522
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:36,940
<23-2,JARED>听我说
<23-2,JARED>Listen to me.

523
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:38,770
<23-3,ESPOSITO>我要你们送她坐飞机去马尔代夫
<23-3,ESPOSITO>I want her flown to the Maldives.

524
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:41,860
<23-4,JARED>那我现在告诉你  鲍勃
<23-4,JARED>Yeah, well, I'm telling you now, Bob.

525
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:43,770
<23-5,ESPOSITO>好吧
<23-5,ESPOSITO>Okay.

526
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,520
<23-6,ESPOSITO>我要你们送她坐飞机去马尔代夫
<23-6,ESPOSITO>I want her flown to the Maldives,

527
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,690
<23-7,JARED>半小时后  我要你关于此事的计划
<23-7,JARED>and in half an hour, I want your plan on how to make that happen.

528
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:49,680
<23-7,JARED>听懂了吗
<23-7,JARED>Are we clear?

529
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,010
<23-7,JARED>鲍勃  送点食物来  是个好主意
<23-7,JARED>Yeah, Bob, food would be great right about now.

530
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:58,220
<23-7,JARED>不  不许派警察来
<23-7,JARED>No. Don't send any cops.

531
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:00,650
<23-7,JARED>我不管他们有没有武器  鲍勃
<23-7,JARED>I don't care if they're unarmed, Bob!

532
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:02,780
<23-7,JARED>我不要警察接近这里
<23-7,JARED>I don't want any police near this car!

533
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:03,970
<23-8,JARED>把食物放下就行
<23-8,JARED>Just drop the food!

534
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:05,390
<23-6,ESPOSITO>那就放在站台边上
<23-6,ESPOSITO>Then set it on the edge of the platform!

535
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:06,720
<23-7,JARED>我派人去取
<23-7,JARED>I'll send somebody to get it.

536
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:12,060
<23-8,JARED>你  她丈夫  你去取
<23-8,JARED>You, the husband, go. Get the food.

537
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,620
<23-8,JARED>我确定你会回来
<23-8,JARED>I know you'll come back.

538
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:19,820
<24-1,BECKETT>坏消息
<24-1,BECKETT>I just got bad news.

539
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,430
<24-1,BECKETT>我打去监狱和艾琳·威尔逊谈了
<24-1,BECKETT>I called the prison and spoke to Erin Wilson.

540
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:24,260
<24-2,CASTLE>然后呢
<24-2,CASTLE>And?

541
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:27,250
<24-3,BECKETT>她是斯通的女友  但她好像
<24-3,BECKETT>She's Stone's girlfriend, but she didn't seem to know

542
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:29,760
<24-3,BECKETT>直到刚刚  才知道他想要救她出去的计划
<24-3,BECKETT>about his plan to break her out until just now.

543
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,000
<24-3,BECKETT>你呢  找到斯通已知同伙的线索了吗
<24-3,BECKETT>What about you? Anything on Stone's known associates?

544
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,770
<24-4,CASTLE>斯通虽然天天挂在网上  但社交很少
<24-4,CASTLE>Stone may have lived online, but he wasn't very social.

545
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:36,390
<24-4,CASTLE>他办了一个释放艾琳·威尔逊的网页
<24-4,CASTLE>He started a "Free Erin Wilson" website

546
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:38,220
<24-4,CASTLE>但好像并未和其他用户有联系
<24-4,CASTLE>but didn't seem to interact with any other users.

547
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,090
<24-5,BECKETT>肯定有人和他联系了
<24-5,BECKETT>He had to have interacted with somebody.

548
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:41,320
<24-5,BECKETT>技术组仔细搜查了他的电脑
<24-5,BECKETT>Tech scrubbed his computer and

549
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,460
<24-5,BECKETT>发现了一个隐藏目录
<24-5,BECKETT>found a hidden directory

550
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,530
<24-5,BECKETT>他们认为里面是秘密通讯
<24-5,BECKETT>that they think contained private correspondence.

551
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:46,340
<24-7,BECKETT>-和谁的  -内容完全被删除了
<24-7,BECKETT>- From whom? - The contents were thoroughly erased.

552
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,170
<24-7,BECKETT>剩下的只有
<24-7,BECKETT>The only thing that was left

553
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:49,670
<24-7,BECKETT>目录的名字  白色骑士
<24-7,BECKETT>was the name of the directory -- "White knight."

554
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:53,010
<25-1,TY>下一个是谁
<25-1,TY>Okay, who's next?

555
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:55,870
<25-1,TY>双份芝士  意大利辣肠加蘑菇
<25-1,TY>We got double cheese, pepperoni, mushroom.

556
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:57,780
<25-2,ARAGON>这里  谢谢
<25-2,ARAGON>Uh, right here. Thanks.

557
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:01,490
<25-3,ARAGON>-你没事吧  -没事
<25-3,ARAGON>- You doing okay? - Yeah.

<25-4,TY>Pineapple, olives, double jalapeno.

560
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:11,180
<25-5,ESPOSITO>-是我的  -真的假的啊
<25-5,ESPOSITO>- That's for me. - Really?

561
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:12,480
<25-6,ARAGON>我们被困在一节地铁车厢
<25-6,ARAGON>We're trapped in a subway car.

562
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:13,950
<25-6,ARAGON>我觉得你还是不吃为好
<25-6,ARAGON>I'm not sure you should eat that.

566
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:56,280
<25-7,ARAGON>你是打算吃它  还是和它深情对视
<25-7,ARAGON>You gonna eat that thing, or just gaze at it in wonder?

567
00:24:56,850 --> 00:25:00,160
<26-1,BECKETT>我不明白  人质救援小组为什么要突击
<26-1,BECKETT>I don't understand. Why does HRT want to breach?

568
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,200
<26-2,GATES>经他们评估  斯通被困此处
<26-2,GATES>In their assessment, Stone is trapped,

569
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,430
<26-2,GATES>没有好的选择  也不能继续原本的计划
<26-2,GATES>with no good options and no way to carry out his original plan.

570
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:07,370
<26-2,GATES>他们认为拖得时间越久
<26-2,GATES>They believe the longer this goes,

571
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:09,570
<26-2,GATES>他越有可能做出鲁莽举动
<26-2,GATES>the more likely he will do the unthinkable.

572
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:11,670
<26-3,RYAN>那为什么不从释放艾琳·威尔逊那边下手
<26-3,RYAN>Well, why not see how things play out with Erin Wilson?

573
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:14,260
<26-4,GATES>救援小组认为艾琳·威尔逊只是幌子
<26-4,GATES>HRT thinks the Erin Wilson demand is a ruse,

574
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:16,590
<26-4,GATES>斯通提这要求是为了拖延时间
<26-4,GATES>Stone is playing this card to buy time,

575
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:17,470
<26-4,GATES>慢慢鼓起勇气
<26-4,GATES>work up his nerve.

576
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:19,910
<26-5,LANIE>突击的话  怎么保证斯通不会引爆呢
<26-5,LANIE>If they bust in, what'll keep Stone from blowing that vest?

577
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:22,010
<26-6,GATES>埃斯波西托  他会参与行动
<26-6,GATES>Esposito will. He's in on it.

578
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:23,540
<26-7,CASTLE>斯通难道不会看到救援小组吗
<26-7,CASTLE>Won't Stone see HRT coming?

579
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:25,290
<26-8,TORY>有可能  如果他们从隧道接近的话
<26-8,TORY>Yes, if they approach via the tunnel,

580
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:27,230
<26-8,TORY>但他们打算通过地铁护栏
<26-8,TORY>but they're dropping onto the train from above,

581
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:28,570
<26-8,TORY>从车厢上方接近
<26-8,TORY>through the subway grates.

582
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,510
<26-9,BECKETT>什么时候
<26-9,BECKETT>When?

583
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:30,370
<26-9,BECKETT>马上
<26-9,BECKETT>Soon.

584
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,610
<26-10,GATES>随时都有可能
<26-10,GATES>Any moment now.

585
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,120
<27-1,ARAGON>你确定我们不告诉其他人
<27-1,ARAGON>You sure - we shouldn't tell the others?

586
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:37,330
<27-1,ARAGON>不能说
<27-1,ARAGON>No.

587
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:41,530
<27-2,ESPOSITO>他们会紧张  那样斯通就会察觉
<27-2,ESPOSITO>They'll get nervous, and Stone will pick up on it.

588
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,870
<27-3,ESPOSITO>你为什么当警察
<27-3,ESPOSITO>Hey, why did you become a cop?

589
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:53,830
<27-4,ARAGON>我退伍之后这是最合理的选择
<27-4,ARAGON>I got out of the army. It's what made the most sense.

590
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:55,680
<27-5,ESPOSITO>我也是
<27-5,ESPOSITO>Me too.

591
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,160
<27-5,ESPOSITO>你怀念当兵的生活吗
<27-5,ESPOSITO>You miss the service?

592
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:00,650
<27-6,ARAGON>怀念其中一部分
<27-6,ARAGON>Some parts.

593
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,880
<27-6,ARAGON>其他就一点都不怀念
<27-6,ARAGON>Not others.

594
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,310
<27-7,ESPOSITO>结婚了吗  有孩子吗
<27-7,ESPOSITO>Married? Kids?

595
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:11,400
<27-7,ESPOSITO>没有  别这样  好吗
<27-7,ESPOSITO>No. Don't do this, okay?

596
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:13,790
<27-8,ARAGON>不要分散我的注意力
<27-8,ARAGON>Don't try to take my mind off of what's coming.

597
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,510
<27-8,ARAGON>我不需要别人握住我的手
<27-8,ARAGON>I don't need anyone holding my hand.

598
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:17,160
<27-9,ESPOSITO>你知道吗  你看上去非常紧张
<27-9,ESPOSITO>You know, you got a chip on your shoulder

599
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,510
<27-9,ESPOSITO>有点暴躁
<27-9,ESPOSITO>the size of stonehenge.

600
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:21,390
<27-9,ESPOSITO>我只是想多了解你一点
<27-9,ESPOSITO>I was just trying to get to know you a little bit.

601
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,570
<27-12,ARAGON>-看到那个了吗  -当然
<27-12,ARAGON>- You see that? - Sure did.

602
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:34,550
<27-13,ESPOSITO>再闪一下我们就行动
<27-13,ESPOSITO>The next flicker is go time.

603
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,890
<27-13,ESPOSITO>-你对计划清楚了吗  -别担心我了
<27-13,ESPOSITO>- You clear on the plan? - Don't worry about me.

604
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,900
<27-15,ARAGON>我感受到振动了  他们在车上
<27-15,ARAGON>I can feel vibrations. They're on the train.

605
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,310
<27-16,JARED>赶紧叫你的人撤退  否则大家都得死
<27-16,JARED>You pull your people back now or everybody dies.

606
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,270
<28-1,BECKETT>立刻
<28-1,BECKETT>Now!

607
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:04,700
<28-2,LANIE>我知道他们在这
<28-2,LANIE>I know they're here!

608
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,030
<27-16,JARED>别耍我  鲍勃
<27-16,JARED>Don't screw with me, Bob,

609
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,510
<27-16,JARED>否则我现在就拉动开关
<27-16,JARED>or I will pull my hand off this trigger right now!

610
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,270
<27-17,JARED>我怎么相信他们都走了呢
<27-17,JARED>How am I supposed to trust they're gone, huh?

611
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,010
<27-17,JARED>你刚才派了突击队
<27-17,JARED>You just tried to send storm troopers

612
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:17,130
<27-17,JARED>在不知道他们和我在哪儿的情况下
<27-17,JARED>into a subway car full of people,

613
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:19,780
<27-17,JARED>冲进一节载满客的地铁车厢
<27-17,JARED>not knowing where they are or where I am...

614
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:26,880
<27-18,JARED>等等
<27-18,JARED>Wait a second.

615
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:43,040
<28-1,BECKETT>别担心  他会没事的
<28-1,BECKETT>Don't worry. He's gonna be okay.

616
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,770
<28-2,LANIE>我知道  我知道
<28-2,LANIE>I know. I know.

617
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:50,980
<28-3,CASTLE>她怎么样
<28-3,CASTLE>How is she?

618
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:54,860
<28-4,BECKETT>至少她看到了哈维  知道他没事
<28-4,BECKETT>Well, at least when she could see Javi, she knew he was okay.

619
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,050
<28-5,CASTLE>我们会把埃斯波救回来的
<28-5,CASTLE>We'll get Espo back.

620
00:27:57,330 --> 00:27:59,180
<28-5,CASTLE>关键是要找出斯通的同伙
<28-5,CASTLE>The key is finding out who Stone was working with.

621
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:01,170
<28-6,BECKETT>答案可能就在那个白衣骑士的目录里
<28-6,BECKETT>The answer's probably in that white knight directory.

622
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:04,160
<28-6,BECKETT>但目前为止  技术部还没能复原任何数据
<28-6,BECKETT>But so far, but tech hasn't been able to recover any of the data.

623
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,990
<28-7,CASTLE>那我们再去看看被害人
<28-7,CASTLE>Well, then, we'll revisit the victim.

624
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:07,610
<28-7,CASTLE>查看保罗·里夫斯的调查
<28-7,CASTLE>Looking into Paul Reeve's investigations

625
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:08,890
<28-7,CASTLE>引领我们找到了斯通
<28-7,CASTLE>is what led us to Stone.

626
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,500
<28-7,CASTLE>也许它还能帮我们找到其他人
<28-7,CASTLE>Perhaps it'll lead us to the others, as well.

627
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,990
<29-1,LANIE>托瑞  我问你些事
<29-1,LANIE>Tory, let me ask you something.

628
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:19,060
<29-1,LANIE>地铁里的监控
<29-1,LANIE>Uh, t-the video from the subway --

629
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:21,300
<29-1,LANIE>在被切断之前  你录下来了吗
<29-1,LANIE>before it cut out, did you record it?

630
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:24,060
<29-2,TORY>当然  所有的视频流都会自动归档
<29-2,TORY>Of course. All streaming video is archived automatically.

631
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:24,820
<29-2,TORY>怎么了
<29-2,TORY>Why?

632
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,800
<29-3,LANIE>你能放给我看吗  有点东西我想看看
<29-3,LANIE>Could you show it to me? There's something I'd like to see.

633
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:33,850
<29-3,LANIE>这些都是保罗·里夫斯
<29-3,LANIE>These are all 20 of the case files

634
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:34,780
<30-1,CASTLE>调查的20份案子文件
<30-1,CASTLE>Paul Reeves was working on.

635
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,690
<30-1,CASTLE>这是所有案子的概述
<30-1,CASTLE>Here's just a summary of those cases.

636
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,270
<30-1,CASTLE>我想我们只要找到
<30-1,CASTLE>I figure we just go through these

637
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:41,050
<30-1,CASTLE>关于斯通  艾琳·威尔逊
<30-1,CASTLE>until something points to Stone or to Erin Wilson

638
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:42,170
<30-1,CASTLE>或者其他有关人就行
<30-1,CASTLE>or anything else we're dealing with.

639
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:42,980
<30-2,BECKETT>好的  我先开始
<30-2,BECKETT>Okay. I'll start.

640
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,870
<30-2,BECKETT>第一个是关于制药实验室
<30-2,BECKETT>Uh, the first one is that pharmaceutical lab

641
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:47,110
<30-2,BECKETT>丢失流感病毒样本
<30-2,BECKETT>cited for losing samples of a flu virus.

642
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,380
<30-3,CASTLE>没想到什么
<30-3,CASTLE>Not ringing any bells.

643
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:49,520
<30-3,CASTLE>下一条是关于药品供应链
<30-3,CASTLE>Moving on to a medical chain

644
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,610
<30-3,CASTLE>故意植入有缺陷的人工髋关节
<30-3,CASTLE>that knowingly implanted defective artificial hips.

645
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:55,230
<30-4,RYAN>伙计们  那个文件  我觉得是参照样本
<30-4,RYAN>Hey, guys, that document -- I think it's a playbook.

646
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,600
<30-4,RYAN>斯通所作所为都是照着上面的话
<30-4,RYAN>Stone's following it to the letter.

647
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,110
<30-4,RYAN>看看这些句子的片段
<30-4,RYAN>Take a look at this sentence fragment.

648
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:01,900
<30-5,BECKETT>要求艾琳·威尔逊被释放  然后挂电话
<30-5,BECKETT>"Demand Erin Wilson's release from prison, then hang up."

649
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,230
<30-5,BECKETT>还有别的指示吗
<30-5,BECKETT>More instructions?

650
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:06,010
<30-5,BECKETT>我是说这貌似没有提供我们不知道的细节
<30-5,BECKETT>I mean, how is that telling us anything we don't already know?

651
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:07,780
<30-6,RYAN>你会明白的  现在看看这个
<30-6,RYAN>You'll see. now take a look at this one.

652
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,830
<30-7,CASTLE>要求送艾琳坐飞机一个没有引渡条约的国家
<30-7,CASTLE>"And demand Erin be flown to a non-extradition country."

653
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,180
<30-8,RYAN>但在文件里那条指示出现在后面
<30-8,RYAN>But that instruction comes later on in the document,

654
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:15,060
<30-8,RYAN>斯通也完全按照上面的指示来行动的
<30-8,RYAN>which is exactly how Stone played it.

655
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,350
<30-8,RYAN>首先他要求释放她
<30-8,RYAN>First, he demanded her release,

656
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:17,940
<30-8,RYAN>然后又提到了马尔代夫
<30-8,RYAN>and then he brought up the Maldives.

657
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,380
<30-9,BECKETT>这说不通啊
<30-9,BECKETT>That doesn't make any sense.

658
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:21,750
<30-9,BECKETT>如果斯通想让艾琳·威尔逊从监狱释放出来
<30-9,BECKETT>If Stone wanted Erin Wilson freed from prison,

659
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:24,250
<30-9,BECKETT>为什么他后来才提到马尔代夫呢
<30-9,BECKETT>then why would he wait to mention the Maldives until later?

660
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:26,580
<30-10,CASTLE>基于同样原因  他提出释放艾琳·威尔逊
<30-10,CASTLE>For the same reason he asked about Erin Wilson's release

661
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:28,400
<30-10,CASTLE>却没有说她是谁
<30-10,CASTLE>without explaining who she was.

662
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:30,430
<30-10,CASTLE>斯通在拖延时间  他在争取时间
<30-10,CASTLE>Stone is stalling. He's playing for time.

663
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,960
<30-10,CASTLE>还有其他的事情  很严重的事
<30-10,CASTLE>Something else is going on here, something big.

664
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,570
<30-11,LANIE>凯特  我得让你看点东西
<30-11,LANIE>Kate, I need to show you something.

665
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:38,480
<31-1,LANIE>我之前看录像的时候注意到了一些细节
<31-1,LANIE>I noticed something when I was watching earlier,

666
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,380
<31-1,LANIE>所以我就重新看了整个录像
<31-1,LANIE>so I went to watch this whole video.

667
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:44,410
<31-1,LANIE>我们遇到了问题  一个新问题
<31-1,LANIE>We have a problem -- a new problem.

668
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:47,930
<31-2,LANIE>这是斯通
<31-2,LANIE>This is Stone

669
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:50,080
<31-2,LANIE>当他把他们当做人质的时候
<31-2,LANIE>back when he was just holding them all hostage.

670
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,920
<31-2,LANIE>这是他后来的样子  再后来
<31-2,LANIE>This is him later... And later.

671
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,200
<31-3,CASTLE>他的哮喘越来越严重
<31-3,CASTLE>His asthma's getting worse.

672
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,620
<31-4,LANIE>不仅仅是哮喘而已
<31-4,LANIE>It's not just his asthma.

673
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:59,100
<31-4,LANIE>看上去他好像发烧感冒了
<31-4,LANIE>It looks like he has fever and chills.

674
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:01,720
<31-4,LANIE>他不能清晰思考  只是时间问题
<31-4,LANIE>It's only a matter of time before he's not able to think clearly.

675
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,820
<31-4,LANIE>他生病了
<31-4,LANIE>The man is sick,

676
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:05,620
<31-4,LANIE>而且流感的病征越来越严重
<31-4,LANIE>and he's getting sicker with flu-like symptoms.

677
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,160
<31-5,BECKETT>流感的病征
<31-5,BECKETT>Flu-like symptoms?

678
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:08,510
<31-5,BECKETT>卡塞尔  那个案子
<31-5,BECKETT>Uh, Castle, that case.

679
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:12,100
<31-5,BECKETT>保罗·里夫斯调查了一起流感病毒的丢失案
<31-5,BECKETT>Paul Reeves was investigating a missing flu virus.

680
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:14,440
<31-5,BECKETT>现在这些都是有关联的了
<31-5,BECKETT>This is all connected somehow.

681
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:16,040
<31-5,BECKETT>一定是有关联
<31-5,BECKETT>It has to be.

682
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:18,550
<32-1,JARED>当我得知她上了国际航班
<32-1,JARED>Once I hear that she's in international airspace,

683
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,010
<32-1,JARED>我就会投降
<32-1,JARED>I'll surrender.

684
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,020
<32-1,JARED>因为我给了你承诺
<32-1,JARED>Because I'm giving you my word.

685
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,720
<32-2,ESPOSITO>斯通看上去不太好
<32-2,ESPOSITO>Stone's not looking too good.

686
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:33,470
<32-3,JARED>到底还要多久才能办到
<32-3,JARED>Hey, exactly how long is that gonna take, huh?

687
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:35,620
<32-4,ESPOSITO>如果他晕过去松掉开关  我们都会死的
<32-4,ESPOSITO>If he passes out and releases that switch, we're all dead.

688
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:36,510
<32-5,JARED>-我们得采取行动  -鲍勃  那
<32-5,JARED>- We got to make a move. - Bob, bob, bob, that's...

689
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:38,370
<32-6,ARAGON>-还是之前的计划吗  -我不能接受  -是的
<32-6,ARAGON>- The same plan as before? - That's not acceptable. - Yeah.

690
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:40,790
<32-8,ARAGON>什么时候
<32-8,ARAGON>When?

691
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,440
<32-9,ESPOSITO>当他吸药分心的时候
<32-9,ESPOSITO>He gets distracted when he puffs on his inhaler.

692
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,530
<32-9,ESPOSITO>下一次  我们就行动
<32-9,ESPOSITO>Next puff, we go.

693
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:48,100
<32-10,JARED>听着  那就是我的条件
<32-10,JARED>Look, those are my conditions.

694
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,100
<32-10,JARED>一旦我知道艾琳被释放
<32-10,JARED>Once I hear from Erin that she's free,

695
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:53,730
<32-10,JARED>我发誓  我会放所有人走的
<32-10,JARED>I swear, I'll let everybody go.

696
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,280
<32-11,JARED>大家别担心
<32-11,JARED>Don't worry, everyone.

697
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:02,460
<32-11,JARED>这一切就快结束了
<32-11,JARED>It's almost over.

698
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,360
<32-12,JARED>不  别
<32-12,JARED>No, stop!

699
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,300
<32-13,ESPOSITO>-求你了  -保护好起爆器
<32-13,ESPOSITO>- Please! - Secure the switch.

700
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:15,480
<32-14,JARED>我的任务还没完成  任务还没有完成
<32-14,JARED>I'm not done yet! I'm not done yet!

701
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,680
<32-15,ESPOSITO>快  快  快  快
<32-15,ESPOSITO>Go, go, go, go.

702
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:20,830
<32-16,ESPOSITO>好样的
<32-16,ESPOSITO>Good job.

703
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,430
<32-17,RYAN>哈维
<32-17,RYAN>Hey, Javi.

704
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:35,100
<32-18,ESPOSITO>怎么样  我们把斯通拿下了
<32-18,ESPOSITO>What's up? We took down Stone.

705
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,970
<32-18,ESPOSITO>没人受伤  大家都很好  都结束了
<32-18,ESPOSITO>Nobody's hurt. Everybody's fine. It's over.

706
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:39,850
<32-19,RYAN>并没有结束  伙计
<32-19,RYAN>It's not over, man.

707
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,200
<32-19,RYAN>什么  什么叫还没有结束
<32-19,RYAN>What? What do you mean, it's not over?

708
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:44,120
<32-20,ESPOSITO>虽然不用搞个漫天纸花的游行之类的
<32-20,ESPOSITO>I don't want a ticker tape parade or anything like that,

709
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,610
<32-20,ESPOSITO>但你难道没有听到我刚才说的吗
<32-20,ESPOSITO>but did you not just hear what I said?

710
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:48,400
<32-21,RYAN>哈维  这不是自杀式炸弹袭击那么简单
<32-21,RYAN>Listen, Javi. This is about more than a suicide vest.

711
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:51,720
<32-21,RYAN>疾控中心在斯通的公寓里发现了
<32-21,RYAN>The CDC turned up a lethal variant of the H5N1 virus

712
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,970
<32-21,RYAN>H5N1病毒的一个致命变种
<32-21,RYAN>in Stone's apartment.

713
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:56,180
<32-21,RYAN>这里是危险区域  斯通也被感染了
<32-21,RYAN>It's a hot zone. Stone's infected.

714
00:31:57,510 --> 00:31:59,200
<32-21,RYAN>他周围的人估计也被感染了吧
<32-21,RYAN>And everyone around him might be, too.

715
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,570
<32-22,DUSTIN>我把门打开了  已经打开了
<32-22,DUSTIN>I got the door open! I got it!

716
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:04,450
<32-23,ESPOSITO>把门关上  马上把门给我关上
<32-23,ESPOSITO>Close that door! I said close it now!

717
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,490
<32-23,ESPOSITO>所有人不许离开
<32-23,ESPOSITO>Nobody leaves the train!

718
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,420
<33-1,BECKETT>长官  埃斯波西托怎么样了
<33-1,BECKETT>Sir, how is Esposito?

719
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:17,210
<33-2,GATES>他和其他人都被转移到医院了
<33-2,GATES>Well, he and the others were transported to the hospital,

720
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:19,780
<33-3,CASTLE>-不过都被隔离观察了  -医生怎么说
<33-3,CASTLE>- but they're in isolation. - What's the prognosis?

721
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:22,710
<33-4,GATES>这个H5N1的病毒变种是致命的
<33-4,GATES>Well, this particular strain of H5N1 is lethal

722
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:25,160
<33-4,GATES>而且能通过空气接触传播
<33-4,GATES>and can be spread through airborne contact.

723
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:27,260
<33-4,GATES>不过是有疫苗的
<33-4,GATES>But there is a vaccine.

724
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,770
<33-4,GATES>疫苗也已经打给乘客们了
<33-4,GATES>It's been given to the passengers,

725
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:31,880
<33-4,GATES>即使接触过之后疫苗也能有效杀死病毒
<33-4,GATES>and it can knock down the virus even after exposure.

726
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:33,340
<33-5,BECKETT>那他应该没事了吧
<33-5,BECKETT>So he's gonna be okay?

727
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:35,130
<33-6,GATES>医生觉得问题不大
<33-6,GATES>Doctors are optimistic.

728
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,770
<33-6,GATES>疾控中心也在调查斯通过去的行踪
<33-6,GATES>And the CDC is retracing Stone's steps

729
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:39,980
<33-6,GATES>确认哪些人和他有过接触
<33-6,GATES>to identify who else he was in contact with.

730
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:42,050
<33-7,CASTLE>这家伙就像是个邪恶版的伤寒玛丽
<33-7,CASTLE>This guy's like an evil version of Typhoid Mary.

732
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:44,360
<33-7,CASTLE>自杀式炸弹背心  那些要求...
<33-7,CASTLE>The suicide vest, the demands --

733
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,210
<33-7,CASTLE>就是为了让人们接触病毒足够长时间
<33-7,CASTLE>All about exposing people long enough

734
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:48,070
<33-7,CASTLE>这样他们就能感染并传播病毒了
<33-7,CASTLE>to get them infected so they'd spread the virus.

735
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:49,270
<33-8,GATES>假如他真的去了研讨会或者歌剧院
<33-8,GATES>Well, it could have been far worse

736
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,800
<33-8,GATES>那情形就会糟糕多了
<33-8,GATES>if he had made it to that seminar or the opera.

737
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,870
<33-8,GATES>如此近距离跟那么多人接触
<33-8,GATES>In proximity to all those people,

738
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,680
<33-8,GATES>他会弄出一场瘟疫来的
<33-8,GATES>he could have caused an epidemic.

739
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:58,170
<33-8,GATES>可我还是不明白
<33-8,GATES>But I-I-I'm still not clear.

740
00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:01,090
<33-8,GATES>那枪击案被害人和这些又有什么关系呢
<33-8,GATES>How does our shooting victim fit into all this?

741
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:03,060
<33-9,BECKETT>保罗·里夫斯之前正调查一个实验室
<33-9,BECKETT>Paul Reeves was investigating the lab

742
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:05,670
<33-9,BECKETT>那里有个H5N1的病毒样本丢失
<33-9,BECKETT>where a sample of H5N1 went missing.

743
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:08,960
<33-10,CASTLE>我们认为他发现斯通偷走了病毒
<33-10,CASTLE>We think he figured out that Stone had stolen the virus,

744
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,260
<33-10,CASTLE>正因为这个斯通才把他骗到公园  杀害了他
<33-10,CASTLE>which is why Stone lured him into the park and killed him.

745
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,270
<33-11,BECKETT>可是长官  这里仍然有很多问题
<33-11,BECKETT>But, sir, there are still questions,

746
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,080
<33-11,BECKETT>比如斯通在和谁合作
<33-11,BECKETT>like who Stone was working with

747
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,990
<33-11,BECKETT>他又是为什么要这么做
<33-11,BECKETT>and why he did this in the first place,

748
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,520
<33-11,BECKETT>我们需要找他谈谈
<33-11,BECKETT>so we need to go and talk to him.

749
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,480
<33-12,GATES>那你们得赶紧了
<33-12,GATES>Well, you better hurry up

750
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:21,090
<33-12,GATES>因为我听说他状况不太好
<33-12,GATES>because I hear he's not in good shape.

751
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:21,890
<33-12,GATES>是的  长官
<33-12,GATES>Yes, sir.

752
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:37,420
<34-1,JARED>你们不是牧师
<34-1,JARED>You're not the priest.

753
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:39,340
<34-2,BECKETT>不是  不过我也可以听你的忏悔
<34-2,BECKETT>No, but I can take your confession.

754
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,030
<34-2,BECKETT>我们知道你还有帮凶  斯通先生
<34-2,BECKETT>We know you had help, Mr. Stone.

755
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:44,520
<34-3,CASTLE>白色骑士  他是谁
<34-3,CASTLE>White Knight, who is he?

756
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:48,430
<34-4,JARED>他是几个月前我在"释放艾琳"网站
<34-4,JARED>Someone I met through the "Free Erin" Site

757
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:49,470
<34-4,JARED>认识的一个人
<34-4,JARED>a few months back.

758
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,660
<34-5,BECKETT>他的真名叫什么
<34-5,BECKETT>What was his real name?

759
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:52,270
<34-5,BECKETT>我不知道
<34-5,BECKETT>I don't know.

760
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:54,660
<34-6,JARED>我们因为艾琳结识
<34-6,JARED>We bonded over Erin,

761
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:56,810
<34-6,JARED>在想怎么把她救出来
<34-6,JARED>over how to get her out.

762
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:59,030
<34-6,JARED>他是个战略大师
<34-6,JARED>He was a strategic thinker.

763
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:01,280
<34-6,JARED>我不是  所以他帮我制定计划
<34-6,JARED>I wasn't, so he helped me with the plan.

764
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,910
<34-6,JARED>我是绝对不会引爆那件背心的
<34-6,JARED>I never would have detonated that vest.

765
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,760
<34-6,JARED>我只是...我只是需要一些谈判条件
<34-6,JARED>I just -- - I just needed some leverage.

766
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:10,080
<34-6,JARED>我爱艾琳
<34-6,JARED>I love Erin.

767
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:14,010
<34-6,JARED>我想要的仅仅是她的自由
<34-6,JARED>All I wanted was to see her free.

768
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:15,880
<34-7,CASTLE>我看你是更想让人们得病
<34-7,CASTLE>More like you wanted to get people sick.

769
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:18,240
<34-8,JARED>你在说什么
<34-8,JARED>What do you mean?

770
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,830
<34-8,JARED>你想通过传播致命病毒
<34-8,JARED>You tried to start an epidemic

771
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:21,430
<34-9,BECKETT>来制造一场瘟疫
<34-9,BECKETT>by spreading your deadly virus.

772
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,080
<34-9,BECKETT>艾琳的事只不过是个插曲罢了
<34-9,BECKETT>Erin was just a sideshow.

773
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,080
<34-10,JARED>你们在说什么
<34-10,JARED>What are you talking about?

774
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:25,650
<34-10,JARED>歌剧院  研讨会...
<34-10,JARED>The opera, the seminar --

775
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:28,480
<34-11,BECKETT>近距离接触权贵
<34-11,BECKETT>hundreds of one-percenters in close proximity.

776
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,150
<34-11,BECKETT>简直就是传播疾病绝佳场所
<34-11,BECKETT>That was the perfect environment to spread your disease.

777
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:33,320
<34-12,JARED>什...疾病
<34-12,JARED>It -- disease?

778
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:37,600
<34-12,JARED>不  我想找个能争取到艾琳的最佳场所
<34-12,JARED>No, I -- I was - trying to find the best spot to take my stand for Erin.

779
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,320
<34-13,BECKETT>那你为什么打电话给保罗·里夫斯
<34-13,BECKETT>Then why did you call Paul Reeves?

780
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,350
<34-14,JARED>白色骑士说那是计划中的一部分
<34-14,JARED>White knight s-said - that it was part of the plan.

781
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:45,260
<34-14,JARED>我...我打电话给里夫斯说在公园见面
<34-14,JARED>I-I...Called Reeves to tell him about some meeting at the park.

782
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:48,530
<34-14,JARED>我压根不知道他是谁
<34-14,JARED>I didn't even know who he was.

783
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,320
<34-15,CASTLE>那研讨会和歌剧院...
<34-15,CASTLE>The seminar and the opera --

784
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:57,040
<34-15,CASTLE>这些也是白色骑士的主意
<34-15,CASTLE>Were those White Knight's ideas, too?

785
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:03,660
<34-16,JARED>原来我被陷害了
<34-16,JARED>So I was set up.

786
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:05,830
<34-16,JARED>有人利用了我
<34-16,JARED>Somebody used me.

787
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:07,860
<34-16,JARED>我得的这个病...
<34-16,JARED>This thing I have --

788
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,380
<34-16,JARED>我也有可能传染给别人了
<34-16,JARED>I may have given it to other people, too?

789
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:20,110
<35-1,CASTLE>刚才的对话和我想象中的不一样
<35-1,CASTLE>Okay, that is not how I imagined that conversation would go.

790
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:22,050
<35-2,BECKETT>如果斯通说的是真的  那他就是替罪羊了
<35-2,BECKETT>If Stone's telling the truth, then he's a fall guy.

791
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:24,330
<35-3,CASTLE>他被利用了  成了装满病毒的容器
<35-3,CASTLE>He was groomed, turned into a vector for the virus,

792
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,210
<35-3,CASTLE>还被操纵传播病毒
<35-3,CASTLE>and manipulated into spreading it.

793
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:28,580
<35-4,BECKETT>这一切都和保罗·里夫斯的调查有关
<35-4,BECKETT>Which means this all connects to Paul Reeves' investigation

794
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,270
<35-4,BECKETT>就是那间储存病毒样本的实验室
<35-4,BECKETT>of the lab where the virus came from.

795
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:34,690
<35-4,BECKETT>斯通是被蓄意感染上的
<35-4,BECKETT>Stone was deliberately infected.

796
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,790
<36-1,BECKETT>疾控中心确认有人把他的哮喘吸入器
<36-1,BECKETT>The CDC confirmed that someone turned his asthma inhaler

797
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:39,650
<36-1,BECKETT>改造成了病毒传播工具
<36-1,BECKETT>into a virus-delivery system.

798
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:41,290
<36-2,CASTLE>问题是这是谁的主意
<36-2,CASTLE>The question is, who came up with that idea?

799
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:44,850
<36-3,BECKETT>答案肯定和这间保罗调查的实验室有关
<36-3,BECKETT>The answer has got to be connected to this lab that Paul was investigating.

800
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:46,850
<36-4,CASTLE>我也这么认为  贝克特  看看这个
<36-4,CASTLE>I think it is. Beckett, take a look at this.

801
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:51,210
<36-4,CASTLE>这间丢失病毒样本的实验...
<36-4,CASTLE>The, uh, lab from which the virus went missing --

802
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:53,280
<36-4,CASTLE>莱瑟姆制药  他们也正是
<36-4,CASTLE>Uh, Latham Pharmaceuticals -- they're the same company

803
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,180
<36-4,CASTLE>制造埃斯波和其他人用的疫苗的公司
<36-4,CASTLE>that makes the vaccine that Espo and the others got.

804
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:57,870
<36-5,BECKETT>这也是他们为什么会有H5N1样本的原因
<36-5,BECKETT>Which is why they had samples of H5N1 in the first place.

805
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:59,840
<36-6,CASTLE>没错  不过作为调查的一部分
<36-6,CASTLE>Right, but as part of his investigation,

806
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:02,160
<36-6,CASTLE>保罗也查了疫苗的生产订单
<36-6,CASTLE>Paul was looking into production orders of the vaccine.

807
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,430
<36-6,CASTLE>特别是这一单  整整1000万单位的疫苗
<36-6,CASTLE>Specifically, this one for 10 million units of the vaccine.

808
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:09,660
<36-7,BECKETT>卡塞尔  全世界只有1000个
<36-7,BECKETT>Castle, there were only 1,000 reported cases

809
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,870
<36-7,BECKETT>H5N1禽流感的通报病例
<36-7,BECKETT>of H5N1 worldwide.

810
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:14,830
<36-8,CASTLE>那莱瑟姆为什么突然要1000万疫苗呢
<36-8,CASTLE>So why would Latham suddenly order up 10 million vaccines?

811
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:16,520
<36-9,BECKETT>除非他们知道疫情要爆发了
<36-9,BECKETT>Unless they knew that there was gonna be an outbreak.

812
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,310
<36-10,CASTLE>我想保罗也有此疑问
<36-10,CASTLE>I think Paul was asking the same question.

813
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:24,260
<37-1,BECKETT>贾维斯女士  谢谢你抽空过来
<37-1,BECKETT>Ms. Jarvis, thank you for taking the time.

814
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:25,270
<37-1,BECKETT>当然
<37-1,BECKETT>O-of course.

815
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:28,530
<37-2,BECKETT>你们找到对保罗下毒手的人了吗
<37-2,BECKETT>Yeah, d -- have you found whoever, uh, did this to Paul?

816
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:31,240
<37-2,BECKETT>不  还没有  但我们确有几个问题想问你
<37-2,BECKETT>No, not yet, but we do have a few questions.

817
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,040
<37-2,BECKETT>你知道他为什么
<37-2,BECKETT>Now, do you know

818
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:35,190
<37-2,BECKETT>要调查莱瑟姆制药吗
<37-2,BECKETT>why he was investigating Latham pharmaceuticals?

819
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,560
<37-2,BECKETT>那是他的工作
<37-2,BECKETT>It was his job.

820
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:39,590
<37-2,BECKETT>用联邦政府的钱生产疫苗的公司
<37-2,BECKETT>Companies that produce vaccines with federal money

821
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:41,240
<37-3,CASTLE>都要受到总审计局的监管
<37-3,CASTLE>are tracked by G.A.O.

822
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,850
<37-3,CASTLE>而莱瑟姆制药生产了治疗一种
<37-3,CASTLE>And Latham developed a vaccine

823
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:45,330
<37-3,CASTLE>罕见却致命的病毒疫苗  对吗
<37-3,CASTLE>for a rare but deadly flu virus, didn't they?

824
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,740
<37-3,CASTLE>那种流感罕见到
<37-3,CASTLE>I mean, a flu so rare

825
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:49,350
<37-3,CASTLE>疫苗一直以来无用武之地
<37-3,CASTLE>that the vaccine just sits on the shelf.

826
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:51,150
<37-3,CASTLE>这种情况我们见得多了
<37-3,CASTLE>Yeah, we see that a lot.

827
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:53,250
<37-4,BECKETT>我们研制出防御型疫苗
<37-4,BECKETT>Preventive vaccines are created,

828
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:56,180
<37-4,BECKETT>但并不是所有的流感病毒都会蔓延
<37-4,BECKETT>but not all flu strains become widespread.

829
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:59,210
<37-4,BECKETT>-要是有人从中作梗就会蔓延  -你说什么
<37-4,BECKETT>- Well, they do with a little help. - Excuse me?

830
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:01,820
<37-5,BECKETT>你最近把所有资产都买了莱瑟姆的股票
<37-5,BECKETT>You recently converted all of your assets to Latham stock.

831
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:02,840
<37-5,BECKETT>为什么
<37-5,BECKETT>Why is that?

832
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:06,030
<37-5,BECKETT>我怎么投资跟你没关系
<37-5,BECKETT>How I invest is none of your concern.

833
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:09,820
<37-6,BECKETT>当你想要引起H5N1疫情  这件事就跟我有关
<37-6,BECKETT>It became my concern when you tried to start an H5N1 epidemic.

834
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:12,290
<37-7,CASTLE>你只需借助一个像杰瑞德·斯通
<37-7,CASTLE>With the help of someone gullible,

835
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:15,060
<37-7,CASTLE>好骗且容易掌控的人就行了
<37-7,CASTLE>someone you could easily manipulate, like Jared Stone.

836
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,120
<37-7,CASTLE>你在说什么啊
<37-7,CASTLE>What on earth are you talking about?

837
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,970
<37-8,BECKETT>我不认识什么杰瑞德·斯通
<37-8,BECKETT>I d -- I don't know any Jared Stone.

838
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:19,890
<37-8,BECKETT>你丈夫是把他女朋友艾琳·威尔逊
<37-8,BECKETT>Your husband was one of the prosecutors

839
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:22,550
<37-8,BECKETT>关进监狱的公诉人之一
<37-8,BECKETT>who put away his girlfriend, Erin Wilson.

840
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:25,230
<37-9,CASTLE>所以当你需要替罪羊时  你知道该找谁
<37-9,CASTLE>So when you needed a patsy, you knew just where to look.

841
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,090
<37-9,CASTLE>接下来当你的同事保罗
<37-9,CASTLE>And then your colleague Paul,

842
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:29,990
<37-9,CASTLE>发现那巨额的疫苗订单时  便开始调查
<37-9,CASTLE>when he saw that huge vaccine order, he started digging.

843
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:31,750
<37-10,BECKETT>当你发现他马上就要查到真相时
<37-10,BECKETT>And when you saw that he was getting closer to the truth,

844
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:32,990
<37-10,BECKETT>你就把他铲除了
<37-10,BECKETT>you eliminated him.

845
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:35,530
<37-10,BECKETT>这太荒唐了  你们无法证明这一切
<37-10,BECKETT>That is absurd. You can't prove any of this.

846
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:36,580
<37-11,CASTLE>实际上  我们可以
<37-11,CASTLE>Actually, we can.

847
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,010
<37-11,CASTLE>我们找到你在白色骑士云端账户下
<37-11,CASTLE>We found the e-mails you wrote in your cloud account,

848
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:41,650
<37-11,CASTLE>写的那些电子邮件了
<37-11,CASTLE>under the username "White Knight."

849
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,410
<37-12,BECKETT>我们还逮捕了跟你合谋的
<37-12,BECKETT>We also arrested a Latham executive

850
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:44,730
<37-12,BECKETT>一名莱瑟姆高层
<37-12,BECKETT>with whom you were colluding.

851
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:47,580
<37-12,BECKETT>他承认了自己的罪行  并与检察官达成了协议
<37-12,BECKETT>He admitted to his role, and he cut a deal.

852
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:49,010
<37-13,CASTLE>他把责任都推给你了
<37-13,CASTLE>And he threw you under the bus.

853
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:49,990
<37-14,BECKETT>你差点就让上千万人感染
<37-14,BECKETT>You could have infected

854
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:52,750
<37-14,BECKETT>并且丧命  贾维斯女士
<37-14,BECKETT>and killed millions of people, Ms. Jarvis.

855
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:53,510
<37-14,BECKETT>这一切
<37-14,BECKETT>And for what,

856
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:56,550
<37-14,BECKETT>就为了你能开上豪车住上豪宅吗
<37-14,BECKETT>so you could drive a nicer car, buy a bigger house?

857
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,500
<37-14,BECKETT>这一切难道就只为了钱吗
<37-14,BECKETT>Was this all just because of money?

858
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,160
<37-14,BECKETT>我要求请律师
<37-14,BECKETT>I want a lawyer.

859
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:03,590
<37-15,BECKETT>你最好找个好点的
<37-15,BECKETT>You better find a good one.

860
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:16,220
<38-2,ESPOSITO>我听说大家都可以出院了
<38-2,ESPOSITO>So, I, uh -- I hear everybody's good to go.

861
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,890
<38-2,ESPOSITO>都很健康
<38-2,ESPOSITO>Clean bills of health.

862
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,070
<38-3,ARAGON>昨天这个时候
<38-3,ARAGON>This time yesterday,

863
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:21,260
<38-3,ARAGON>得上流感是我们最不关心的问题
<38-3,ARAGON>catching the flu - was the least of our problems.

864
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:22,280
<38-4,ESPOSITO>你干得很不错
<38-4,ESPOSITO>You did all right down there.

865
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,140
<38-4,ESPOSITO>我才不管他们怎么说交通警呢
<38-4,ESPOSITO>I don't care what they say about transit cops.

866
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:26,570
<38-5,ARAGON>他们对警探也没说什么好话
<38-5,ARAGON>What they say about gold shields is even worse --

867
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:27,800
<38-5,ARAGON>因为那是实话实说
<38-5,ARAGON>mostly 'cause it's true.

868
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:32,170
<38-6,ESPOSITO>我们合作完美
<38-6,ESPOSITO>We make a tight team.

869
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,420
<38-7,ARAGON>在战斗中培养出来的感情  你明白的
<38-7,ARAGON>Bonds forged in the heat of battle -- you know how it is.

870
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:36,600
<38-8,ESPOSITO>是
<38-8,ESPOSITO>Yeah.

871
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:39,230
<38-9,ARAGON>我没跟你说实话
<38-9,ARAGON>I wasn't straight with you.

872
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,040
<38-9,ARAGON>我有个五岁的儿子
<38-9,ARAGON>I have a 5-year-old son.

873
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,330
<38-10,ESPOSITO>你说你没成家
<38-10,ESPOSITO>Uh, you said that you didn't have a family.

874
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,180
<38-10,ESPOSITO>为什么要隐瞒呢
<38-10,ESPOSITO>Why hide that?

875
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:50,790
<38-11,ARAGON>我不想让你因为我是个母亲而担心
<38-11,ARAGON>I didn't want you worried about me being a mom down there.

876
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:53,560
<38-12,ESPOSITO>你真是个人物  梅丽莎
<38-12,ESPOSITO>You are a piece of work, Marisa.

877
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:54,840
<38-13,ARAGON>莱妮是谁
<38-13,ARAGON>Who's Lenny?

878
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:57,170
<38-13,ARAGON>还是叫蕾妮
<38-13,ARAGON>Or is it Lanie?

879
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,170
<38-14,ESPOSITO>你怎么知道的
<38-14,ESPOSITO>How do you know about her?

880
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,320
<38-15,ARAGON>我上次任务中被简易爆炸装置炸坏了鼓膜
<38-15,ARAGON>On my last tour, an I.E.D. blew out my eardrum.

881
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,880
<38-15,ARAGON>所以我现在很会读唇语
<38-15,ARAGON>Got pretty good at reading lips.

882
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:07,000
<38-15,ARAGON>在你制住斯通前你念了她的名字
<38-15,ARAGON>You were saying her name before you took down Stone.

883
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,790
<38-16,ESPOSITO>我不  我不记得了
<38-16,ESPOSITO>Yeah, I don't -- I don't remember that.

884
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,880
<38-17,ARAGON>你在那个时刻想到的人  对你来说很重要
<38-17,ARAGON>Who you think of - in that moment -- it has weight.

885
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:17,280
<38-17,ARAGON>别用宝贵的东西去换取别的东西
<38-17,ARAGON>Don't trade what's real for something that isn't.

886
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:21,060
<38-18,ARAGON>回头见  哈维
<38-18,ARAGON>I'll see you around, Javi.

887
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,410
<39-1,CASTLE>我们可不是每天都能遇到这种
<39-1,CASTLE>Well, it's not every day you come across someone

888
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:33,940
<39-1,CASTLE>比人肉炸弹还可恨的人
<39-1,CASTLE>who makes a suicide bomber look like the good guy.

889
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:36,060
<39-2,BECKETT>我联系过医院了
<39-2,BECKETT>So, I talked to the hospital.

890
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:38,660
<39-2,BECKETT>杰瑞德·斯通会恢复的
<39-2,BECKETT>Jared Stone will make a full recovery,

891
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:41,040
<39-2,BECKETT>但显然他的麻烦还没完呢
<39-2,BECKETT>though clearly his troubles aren't over yet.

892
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,930
<39-3,CASTLE>是啊  除非他也能进艾琳·威尔逊所在的监狱
<39-3,CASTLE>Yeah, unless he goes to the same prison as Erin Wilson,

893
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:45,570
<39-3,CASTLE>因为说到底杰瑞德·斯通犯罪的动机
<39-3,CASTLE>because in the end, Jared Stone was driven

894
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:49,200
<39-3,CASTLE>是出于最原始的感情  爱
<39-3,CASTLE>by the most primal of emotions -- love.

895
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:51,490
<39-4,BECKETT>只不过他可以找个更妥当的方式来表达
<39-4,BECKETT>Except he could have picked a better way to express it.

896
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:54,190
<39-5,RYAN>-看看谁来了  -你好吗
<39-5,RYAN>- Hey, look who's here. - What's up?

897
00:39:55,850 --> 00:39:57,360
<39-8,CASTLE>战无不胜的英雄万岁
<39-8,CASTLE>Hail the conquering hero!

898
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,510
<39-9,RYAN>伙计  你可吓死我了
<39-9,RYAN>Man, you gave me a scare.

899
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:02,140
<39-10,ESPOSITO>-那是因为你没胆  -好吧
<39-10,ESPOSITO>- That's because you're a wimp. - Oh. Okay.

900
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:04,690
<39-12,BECKETT>要是这么说的话  我也是没胆的人咯
<39-12,BECKETT>Yeah, well, I guess that makes me a wimp, too.

901
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:07,050
<39-14,LANIE>还有我的份吗
<39-14,LANIE>Got any of that left over for me?

902
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:13,320
<39-15,LANIE>哈维  我都快吓死了  我还以为
<39-15,LANIE>Javi, I was worried sick. I thought --

903
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,970
<39-16,ESPOSITO>我懂  但我好着呢
<39-16,ESPOSITO>I know what you thought, but I'm here.

904
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:18,090
<39-17,ESPOSITO>我回来了  我没事
<39-17,ESPOSITO>I'm back. I'm all right.

905
