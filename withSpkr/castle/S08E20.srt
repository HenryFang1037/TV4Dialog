<2-13,CASTLE>YOLO会花等量的钱帮助不幸的他人

00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,280
<2-20,BECKETT>直到本·富兰克林开始泡我
<2-20,BECKETT>Except for when Ben Franklin started hitting on me.

76
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:53,980
<2-20,BECKETT>那没什么

<3-19,ERIN>I-I can't believe this is happening.

130
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,080
<3-19,ERIN>赞恩和我时隔这么多年终于有机会
<3-19,ERIN>Zane and I finally get a chance to work together

131
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,880
<3-19,ERIN>一起合作了  就发生这种事

<3-23,ERIN>他很害怕  怕《哈姆雷特》
<3-23,ERIN>He was terrified... of "Hamlet."

00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:44,290
<3-23,ERIN>他真心想通过这个角色表现自己的演技
<3-23,ERIN>He really wanted to show his acting chops in this role.

<3-23,ERIN>有时候他会下班后来加班练习
<3-23,ERIN>Sometimes he would come here after hours to work more.

<3-25,ERIN>他有跟女主角上床的习惯
<3-25,ERIN>It's no secret he had a reputation

142
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,720
<3-25,ERIN>这已不是秘密
<3-25,ERIN>for sleeping with his leading ladies.

143
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,930
<3-26,CASTLE>你是说赞恩在跟饰演
<3-26,CASTLE>Are you saying Zane was sleeping with

00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,280
<3-27,ERIN>她一副《致命诱惑》不肯放手的样子
<3-27,ERIN>She sort of went all "Fatal Attraction."

<3-27,ERIN>她拿棒球棒砸了他的DB9
<3-27,ERIN>So she took a baseball bat to his DB9.

152
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:17,680
<3-29,ERIN>但是演员那种疯  不是杀人犯那种
<3-29,ERIN>but actor crazy, not murderer crazy.

153
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:19,660
<3-29,ERIN>但有个小问题
<3-29,ERIN>However, there is one teeny, tiny, little thing

154
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,730
<3-29,ERIN>你们该知道
<3-29,ERIN>you should know about.

155
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,960
<3-29,ERIN>纳奥米是个方法派演员
<3-29,ERIN>Naomi's a method actor,

156
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:25,080
<3-29,ERIN>就是说她并不扮演角色
<3-29,ERIN>meaning she doesn't play the characters.

157
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:26,400
<3-29,ERIN>而是要变成角色

<3-30,CASTLE>你知道我们要去哪找到她吗

<4-1,RYAN>希望我刚刚不会太过
<4-1,RYAN>I just hope I wasn't too obvious back there.

<4-1,RYAN>我实在太喜欢艾琳·切尔洛夫了
<4-1,RYAN>I'm just such a big fan of Erin Cherloff.

162
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:36,180
<4-3,RYAN>刚跟她说话时  我突然想到个
<4-3,RYAN>I'm -- Just speaking with her, I got this great idea

163
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,790
<4-3,RYAN>萨拉·格蕾丝幼儿园剧的好点子
<4-3,RYAN>for the play at Sarah Grace's preschool

00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,080
<4-3,RYAN>我是志愿者
<4-3,RYAN>where I'm a parent volunteer at.

165
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,510
<4-4,ESPOSITO>等等  幼儿园现在都演剧了
<4-4,ESPOSITO>Wait, preschools have plays now?

<4-4,ESPOSITO>我的幼儿园就是每天跟妈妈上班
<4-4,ESPOSITO>My preschool was going to work with my mom every day.

<4-5,CASTLE>我也是
<4-5,CASTLE>Oh, same here.

168
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:47,890
<4-5,CASTLE>我就在这样的走廊里长大
<4-5,CASTLE>I grew up in hallways just like this.

169
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,770
<4-5,CASTLE>在妈妈的换衣室里待着
<4-5,CASTLE>Spending time in my mother's dressing room,

170

<4-5,CASTLE>拿她的戏服  化妆品玩
<4-5,CASTLE>experimenting with her costumes, her makeup.

171
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,600
<4-6,CASTLE>得了
<4-6,CASTLE>Oh, get over it.

172
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,530
<4-6,CASTLE>总之  或许我们的方法派演员太入戏了
<4-6,CASTLE>Anyway, maybe our method actress has gone a little too method.

173
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:03,450
<4-6,CASTLE>在剧中  哈姆雷特将奥菲莉亚逼疯
<4-6,CASTLE>In the play, Hamlet drives Ophelia mad.

174
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:06,820
<4-6,CASTLE>如果生活模拟了艺术  而她彻底疯了
<4-6,CASTLE>If this is life imitating art and she's gone full Ophelia,

175
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,730
<4-6,CASTLE>我们得做好一切准备

200
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,580
<5-12,NAOMI>是一时冲动
<5-12,NAOMI>when I smashed up Zane's car,

201
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,090
<5-12,NAOMI>但我没杀他

<5-14,CASTLE>除非她喝的是蜂蜜酒  还用手吃东西

209
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,410
<5-15,NAOMI>但他好像出轨了
<5-15,NAOMI>but he was acting like he was cheating on me,

210

<5-15,NAOMI>晚上很晚跑去我那儿
<5-15,NAOMI>showing up at my place at all hours of the night,

211
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:28,140
<5-15,NAOMI>找各种烂借口

00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,330
<5-15,NAOMI>所以我质问了他  他就爆发了
<5-15,NAOMI>So I confronted him, and he blew up,

<5-15,NAOMI>叫我再也不要问他都去哪
<5-15,NAOMI>told me never to ask where he goes again.

<6-2,BECKETT>So, why is there a video of Zane's body on the news?

221

<6-4,NEWS PRESENTER>并有纽约警局12分局的协助
<6-4,NEWS PRESENTER>with an assist from the NYPD's 12th Precinct.

227
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,200
<6-5,BECKETT>总局一直叮嘱我要控制媒体报道
<6-5,BECKETT>1PP has been on my ass about keeping media under control,

228
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,310
<6-5,BECKETT>现在我丈夫还成了调查的脸面
<6-5,BECKETT>and now my husband is the face of the investigation.

229
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,800
<6-6,CASTLE>-并不都是坏消息  贝克特  -怎么说

231
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,810
<6-9,BECKETT>有嫌疑人了吗
<6-9,BECKETT>Do we have a suspect?

232
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:19,950
<6-10,ESPOSITO>还没有  纳奥米的不在场证明核实了
<6-10,ESPOSITO>Not yet. Naomi's alibi checked out.

234
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:23,480
<6-10,ESPOSITO>与赞恩约会的神秘女子的线索了
<6-10,ESPOSITO>on this mystery woman that Zane was seeing.

00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,680
<6-10,ESPOSITO>他的财务情况查到了

237
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:29,970
<6-11,CASTLE>可以理解  纳奥米砸了他的DB9嘛
<6-11,CASTLE>Which makes sense, since Naomi trashed his DB9.

238
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:31,850
<6-12,BECKETT>-豪车去了哪  -还不知道
<6-12,BECKETT>- And where was this limo going? - I don't know yet.

240
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:34,770
<6-13,ESPOSITO>但希望他知道那女子是谁
<6-13,ESPOSITO>but hopefully he knows who this woman is.

241
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:36,110
<6-14,RYAN>我已经找到了她
<6-14,RYAN>I have already found her.

242
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:38,610
<6-14,RYAN>原来赞恩用假名在
<6-14,RYAN>It turns out that Zane was renting a suite

243
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:41,650
<6-14,RYAN>黑门酒店租了间房
<6-14,RYAN>at the Black Door Hotel under a fake name.

244
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,400
<6-15,CASTLE>黑门啊  很上档次嘛
<6-15,CASTLE>Ah, the Black Door. Yes, very fancy.

245
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,260
<6-16,ESPOSITO>保密性非常好
<6-16,ESPOSITO>Known for being discreet...

246
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,110
<6-16,ESPOSITO>我是这么听说的
<6-16,ESPOSITO>is what I've heard

247
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,180
<6-17,CASTLE>听一些曾经单身
<6-17,CASTLE>from other people who were once single

248
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,590
<6-17,CASTLE>现在已婚的人说的
<6-17,CASTLE>and now married.

249
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,120
<6-18,RYAN>他们的确是
<6-18,RYAN>Well, they certainly seem to be living up

250
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,550
<6-18,RYAN>名不虚传
<6-18,RYAN>to that reputation.

251
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:55,710
<6-18,RYAN>一开始什么都不肯说
<6-18,RYAN>Wouldn't say a word

252
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,480
<6-18,RYAN>直到我威胁告他们妨碍司法
<6-18,RYAN>until I accused them of obstruction.

253
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,710
<6-18,RYAN>但赞恩在那里租房已经两周了
<6-18,RYAN>But Zane has had a suite there for the past two weeks,

254
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:02,070
<6-18,RYAN>他每晚都跟一个女人在一起
<6-18,RYAN>and he was with a woman there every night.

255
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:03,240
<6-19,BECKETT>好  那女人是谁
<6-19,BECKETT>Okay, who is this woman?

256
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,030
<6-20,RYAN>不知道  她不是登记住客  但是
<6-20,RYAN>No idea. She's not a registered guest, but get this.

257
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:09,000
<6-20,RYAN>她不仅是在死亡时间之后回去的
<6-20,RYAN>Not only did she arrive after our time-of-death window.

258
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,060
<6-20,RYAN>而且尚未离开
<6-20,RYAN>She's still there.

259
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:14,660
<7-1,CASTLE>开着请勿打扰灯
<7-1,CASTLE>Privacy light is on.

260
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,360
<7-2,ESPOSITO>她肯定还在里面
<7-2,ESPOSITO>She must still be here.

261
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:20,490
<7-2,ESPOSITO>纽约警局
<7-2,ESPOSITO>NYPD.

262
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,490
<7-3,RYAN>请你开下门
<7-3,RYAN>Could you open it, please?

263
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,410
<7-4,RYAN>-纽约警局  -警察
<7-4,RYAN>- NYPD. - Police.

264
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:43,580
<7-6,ESPOSITO>床上有个红发女
<7-6,ESPOSITO>There's a ginger in the bed.

265
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:48,740
<7-7,CASTLE>母亲
<7-7,CASTLE>Mother?!

266
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,760
<7-8,MARTHA RODGERS>理查德
<7-8,MARTHA RODGERS>Richard?

276
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:03,170
<7-8,MARTHA RODGERS>我昨晚
<7-8,MARTHA RODGERS>I, um -- I got tired -

277
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,780
<8-1,MARTHA>等赞恩等累了...
<8-1,MARTHA>waiting for Zane last night,

278
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:08,220
<8-1,MARTHA>于是就  上床睡着了
<8-1,MARTHA>so I just, uh, crawled into bed.

279
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,830
<8-1,MARTHA>我完全无法想象他是出了什么事
<8-1,MARTHA>Never could I imagine what happened to him.

280
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:11,980
<8-2,CASTLE>母亲  你为什么
<8-2,CASTLE>Mother, why are you -- -

281
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:16,260
<8-2,CASTLE>你为什么会在赞恩的床上
<8-2,CASTLE>Why -- Why -- Why were you in Zane's bed?

282
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,420
<8-3,MARTHA>因为他来上课迟到了
<8-3,MARTHA>Because he was late for our session.

283
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,150
<8-4,RYAN>什么课
<8-4,RYAN>What kind of session?

284
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,270
<8-5,ESPOSITO>现在都这么叫了吗
<8-5,ESPOSITO>Is that what they call it?

285
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,490
<8-6,CASTLE>-够了  -好吧
<8-6,CASTLE>- That's enough. - Okay.

286
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,790
<8-8,CASTLE>母亲  你是说你在跟赞恩·卡侬上床吗
<8-8,CASTLE>Mother, are you saying you were sleeping with Zane Cannon?

287
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:29,670
<8-9,MARTHA>别那么龌龊  理查德
<8-9,MARTHA>Oh, drop the gavel, Richard!

288
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,210
<8-9,MARTHA>我是他的演技指导  绝不是他的情妇
<8-9,MARTHA>I was his acting coach, certainly not his mistress.

289
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:37,020
<8-9,MARTHA>那可怜的孩子饰演哈姆雷特完全是自不量力
<8-9,MARTHA>The poor boy was out of his depth trying to play Hamlet,

290
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,520
<8-9,MARTHA>所以有人叫他来找我了
<8-9,MARTHA>so he was referred to me.

291
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:41,750
<8-9,MARTHA>赞恩需要我随叫随到
<8-9,MARTHA>Zane needed me to be on call 24 hours a day.

292
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,120
<8-9,MARTHA>所以他租下了这间房
<8-9,MARTHA>So he had this suite

293
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,610
<8-9,MARTHA>方便我们随时见面
<8-9,MARTHA>so that we could meet comfortably at any time.

294
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:50,280
<8-9,MARTHA>我们将这间屋子变成了莎翁的圣殿
<8-9,MARTHA>We turned this room into a temple to the Bard.

295
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,050
<8-9,MARTHA>也成了一种新生的圣殿
<8-9,MARTHA>It also became a temple to a new life.

296
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:54,310
<8-10,ESPOSITO>什么意思  "新生"
<8-10,ESPOSITO>What do you mean, "New life"?

297
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:55,710
<8-11,MARTHA>你也知道我是个人生导师
<8-11,MARTHA>Well, you know I'm a life coach.

298
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:58,940
<8-11,MARTHA>我帮赞恩走出了他盛名的迷雾
<8-11,MARTHA>I helped Zane to just clear out the clutter of stardom

299
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:01,850
<8-11,MARTHA>好专注于他的演技
<8-11,MARTHA>so that he could focus on his craft.

300
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:03,680
<8-12,RYAN>他有提到有什么敌人吗
<8-12,RYAN>Did he ever mention having any enemies?

301
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:06,220
<8-13,MARTHA>没有  但他有些心魔
<8-13,MARTHA>No, but he did have some demons, though.

302
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,590
<8-13,MARTHA>他过去有件什么事
<8-13,MARTHA>There was something in his past

303
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:09,040
<8-13,MARTHA>对他来说是个很大的阻碍
<8-13,MARTHA>that was a real block for him.

304
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,480
<8-14,CASTLE>他肯定把那事告诉你了吧
<8-14,CASTLE>Certainly he told you what the block was.

305
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,870
<8-15,MARTHA>没有  他对此很保密  甚至害怕
<8-15,MARTHA>No, he was very secretive about it, frightened, even.

306
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,200
<8-15,MARTHA>当然  我鼓励他
<8-15,MARTHA>Oh, of course I encouraged him

307
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,100
<8-15,MARTHA>去面对心魔了
<8-15,MARTHA>to engage with those demons, and...

308
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:19,340
<8-15,MARTHA>等等  我们上次说话时
<8-15,MARTHA>Wait a minute. The last time we spoke,

309
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:23,400
<8-15,MARTHA>他说做了安排去面对心魔了
<8-15,MARTHA>he said that he had made arrangements to do just that.

310
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,320
<8-15,MARTHA>天呐
<8-15,MARTHA>Oh, dear God.

311
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:30,320
<8-15,MARTHA>不会是我怂恿他做了一件
<8-15,MARTHA>Don't tell me that I might have pushed him into something

312
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,700
<8-15,MARTHA>害死了他的事吧
<8-15,MARTHA>that got him killed.

313
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,330
<8-16,CASTLE>不不  不是那样的
<8-16,CASTLE>No. No. Nothing like that.

314
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:35,030
<8-17,MARTHA>不
<8-17,MARTHA>No.

315
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:37,100
<8-18,CASTLE>-不是吗  -不是  好了
<8-18,CASTLE>- No? - No, come on.

316
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,040
<8-18,CASTLE>我送你回家吧  走吧
<8-18,CASTLE>Let's get you home. Come on.

317
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:41,510
<9-1,BECKETT>莱恩  等等
<9-1,BECKETT>Ryan, wait.

318
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:42,640
<9-1,BECKETT>听着
<9-1,BECKETT>Hey, listen.

319
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,400
<9-1,BECKETT>该我安排约会之夜了  但我忘了
<9-1,BECKETT>It's my turn to plan date night, but I forgot,

320
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,960
<9-1,BECKETT>如果我不能超越他上周的安排
<9-1,BECKETT>and Castle's gonna lord it over me

321
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,530
<9-1,BECKETT>卡塞尔肯定要揪着不放了
<9-1,BECKETT>if I don't outdo what he did last week.

322
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:50,090
<9-1,BECKETT>所以  我需要点子
<9-1,BECKETT>So I need a few ideas.

323
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,760
<9-2,RYAN>-等等  盖过塞尔吗  -对
<9-2,RYAN>- Wait -- for Castle? - Yeah.

324
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,510
<9-3,BECKETT>等等
<9-3,BECKETT>Wait, wait, wait, wait.

325
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,340
<9-4,RYAN>他可是
<9-4,RYAN>The, uh -- The guy who, uh,

326
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:57,040
<9-4,RYAN>上次万圣节带你
<9-4,RYAN>took you on - an urban-spelunking adventure

327
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,600
<9-4,RYAN>去城市地铁隧道进行洞穴探险
<9-4,RYAN>through the city subway tunnels last Halloween,

328
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,280
<9-4,RYAN>还曾雇演员
<9-4,RYAN>and then he hired actors

329
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,520
<9-4,RYAN>重演电影《C.H.U.D.》的人
<9-4,RYAN>to re-enact scenes from the movie "C.H.U.D."

330
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,430
<9-4,RYAN>我根本想不出这么好的点子
<9-4,RYAN>Yeah, I can't -- I can't come up with stuff like that.

331
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:06,140
<9-4,RYAN>喂
<9-4,RYAN>Yo.

332
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,110
<9-5,ESPOSITO>赞恩被杀那天早上雇的
<9-5,ESPOSITO>I just heard back from that limo driver

333
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:09,960
<9-5,ESPOSITO>豪车司机回我电话了
<9-5,ESPOSITO>that Zane hired the morning of his murder.

334
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,250
<9-5,ESPOSITO>你不会相信他去了哪的
<9-5,ESPOSITO>You'll never believe where he went --

335
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,440
<9-5,ESPOSITO>新新监狱
<9-5,ESPOSITO>Sing Sing Penitentiary.

336
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,360
<9-6,BECKETT>他为什么去那儿
<9-6,BECKETT>Why did he go there?

337
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,790
<9-7,ESPOSITO>接一位刚释放的囚犯
<9-7,ESPOSITO>To pick up a newly released inmate --

338
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:18,280
<9-7,ESPOSITO>强尼·托罗  他恰好还是
<9-7,ESPOSITO>Johnny Toro, who also happens to be

339
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,840
<9-7,ESPOSITO>与他疏离的继兄
<9-7,ESPOSITO>his estranged older stepbrother.

340
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,200
<9-8,BECKETT>我们怎么会不知道赞恩有个继兄
<9-8,BECKETT>How did we not know that Zane had a stepbrother?

341
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,580
<9-9,ESPOSITO>异父  异姓
<9-9,ESPOSITO>Different dads, different names,

342
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:26,080
<9-9,ESPOSITO>据赞恩的公关表示  他没有声张此事
<9-9,ESPOSITO>and according to Zane's publicist, he kept it quiet.

343
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,420
<9-9,ESPOSITO>他不想跟此人扯上关系
<9-9,ESPOSITO>He didn't want to be associated with this guy.

344
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,050
<9-10,RYAN>-那他为什么去监狱  -我不知道
<9-10,RYAN>- Then why'd he show up at the prison? - I don't know.

345
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:30,400
<9-11,ESPOSITO>但据豪车司机说
<9-11,ESPOSITO>According to the limo driver, though,

346
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,900
<9-11,ESPOSITO>场面绝不是幸福的家庭团聚
<9-11,ESPOSITO>it was far from a happy family reunion.

347
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:34,140
<9-11,ESPOSITO>虽然车内隔挡竖起来了
<9-11,ESPOSITO>The privacy screen was up,

348
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,840
<9-11,ESPOSITO>但他听得出托罗在吼赞恩
<9-11,ESPOSITO>but he could tell that Toro was yelling at Zane.

349
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,720
<9-12,BECKETT>他因擅闯蹲了12年
<9-12,BECKETT>He served 12 years for a B&E.

350
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,440
<9-13,ESPOSITO>他在里面慢慢酝酿了对赞恩的恨意
<9-13,ESPOSITO>Where he stewed on how much he hated Zane.

351
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,350
<9-13,ESPOSITO>看看监狱心理医生的笔记
<9-13,ESPOSITO>Check out the prison psychologist's notes.

352
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,850
<9-13,ESPOSITO>看来他对赞恩有很多积怨
<9-13,ESPOSITO>Apparently, there was a lot of built-up rage against Zane.

353
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:49,370
<9-14,BECKETT>根据证据  闯入是两人合伙干的
<9-14,BECKETT>You know, evidence suggests that this break-in was a two-man job.

354
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,210
<9-15,ESPOSITO>警方怀疑过赞恩
<9-15,ESPOSITO>Cops suspected Zane

355
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:52,720
<9-15,ESPOSITO>但只有针对托罗的证据
<9-15,ESPOSITO>but only had evidence against Toro.

356
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,240
<9-16,BECKETT>而托罗最终入狱了
<9-16,BECKETT>And then Toro took the fall.

357
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,600
<9-17,ESPOSITO>赞恩搬去了好莱坞  成了大明星
<9-17,ESPOSITO>And Zane moves to Hollywood and becomes a movie star.

358
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,150
<9-18,BECKETT>好吧  叫他进来
<9-18,BECKETT>All right, get him in here.

359
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:00,310
<10-1,TORO>我的假释就是这样吗
<10-1,TORO>This what it's gonna be like now I'm on parole?

360
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:03,140
<10-1,TORO>每天都要受警察的骚扰
<10-1,TORO>Just can't go a day without being harassed by the cops?

361
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:05,550
<10-2,RYAN>你打破了最快再犯罪的纪录就难免了
<10-2,RYAN>Not when you set a record for fastest recidivism.

362
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:08,510
<10-3,ESPOSITO>你才出去10小时  就杀了赞恩
<10-3,ESPOSITO>You were out all of 10 hours before you murdered Zane.

<10-5,RYAN>是吗  你就这个回应
<10-5,RYAN>Really? That's your response?

<10-6,TORO>Z的事我很难过
<10-6,TORO>I'm busted up over what happened to Z.

370
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:19,790
<10-7,ESPOSITO>不  你是气他

<10-8,TORO>我不知道你在说什么  哥们
<10-8,TORO>I don't know what the hell you're talking about, man.

<10-8,TORO>我是哥哥
<10-8,TORO>I was the big brother.

374
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:31,120
<10-8,TORO>我逼Z不得说出我们去擅闯的事
<10-8,TORO>I made Z keep his mouth shut on that B&E we pulled, man.

375
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,920
<10-8,TORO>叫他去混出个人样来
<10-8,TORO>Told him to make something of himself.

<10-9,ESPOSITO>that you had a giant hate-on for Zane.

378
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,470
<10-10,TORO>他抛弃了我
<10-10,TORO>He abandoned me.

379
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,200
<10-10,TORO>从不来探视
<10-10,TORO>And not one visit.

380
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:44,050
<10-10,TORO>不打电话
<10-10,TORO>No calls.

<10-10,TORO>也不给我点钱
<10-10,TORO>Didn't put any money on my books.

382
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:47,920
<10-10,TORO>什么都没有
<10-10,TORO>Nothing.

383
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:52,130
<10-10,TORO>跑去做了明星  丢下我自生自灭
<10-10,TORO>Just went off to become a star, and he left me to rot.

384
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:54,770
<10-11,RYAN>豪车司机说他去接你时  你俩吵得很凶
<10-11,RYAN>Limo driver said things got pretty heated when he picked you up.

385
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:56,740
<10-12,TORO>是啊  但豪车司机没听到
<10-12,TORO>Yeah, but what the limo driver didn't hear

386
00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:00,130
<10-12,TORO>我们摒弃前嫌  因为他道歉了
<10-12,TORO>was us squashing our beef, 'cause he apologized,

387
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:03,100
<10-12,TORO>他说会安排好我的余生
<10-12,TORO>said he would set me up for the rest of my life.

388
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:05,480
<10-12,TORO>让我等着他先处理好自己的财政问题
<10-12,TORO>Just had to get his financial problems figured out.

389
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:06,260
<10-13,RYAN>什么财政问题
<10-13,RYAN>What financial problems?

390
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,990
<10-13,RYAN>赞恩银行里有一千万呢
<10-13,RYAN>Zane had $10 million in the bank.

391
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,910
<10-14,TORO>他欠国税局1.5千万的退缴税
<10-14,TORO>He owed the IRS 15 mil in back taxes.

392
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,620
<10-14,TORO>他两个月后就要破产了
<10-14,TORO>He was gonna be broke in like two months.

393
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:13,390
<10-15,RYAN>那他为什么没接
<10-15,RYAN>Then why'd he walk away

394
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:15,940
<10-15,RYAN>薪酬8百万的电影《安全词》
<10-15,RYAN>from an $8 million payday in that "Safe Word" movie

395
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,370
<10-15,RYAN>而去拍莎士比亚
<10-15,RYAN>to go do Shakespeare?

396
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:19,450
<10-16,TORO>他说他有捞钱的计划
<10-16,TORO>He said he had a plan to get paid.

00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:21,350
<10-16,TORO>是什么大计划
<10-16,TORO>Something big, man.

398
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:25,210
<11-1,ESPOSITO>看来可能是赞恩卷入的挣钱计划
<11-1,ESPOSITO>Sounds like whatever money-making scheme Zane was involved in

399
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,810
<11-1,ESPOSITO>害死了他
<11-1,ESPOSITO>is probably what got him killed.

400
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:27,770
<11-1,ESPOSITO>唯一的问题是
<11-1,ESPOSITO>Only question is --

<14-1,RYAN>我对演出的设想
<14-1,RYAN>my vision of the play.

472
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:00,170
<14-2,ELODIE>你的设想
<14-2,ELODIE>Your vision?

473
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:02,140
<14-3,RYAN>是的  我认为
<14-3,RYAN>Yeah, I see the kids

474
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:05,440
<14-3,RYAN>孩子们在融入生命之圈
<14-3,RYAN>as embodying the circle of life.

475
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,000
<14-4,ELODIE>只是一个花朵舞蹈
<14-4,ELODIE>It's just a flower dance.

476
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,460
<14-5,RYAN>我来跟你演示一下我的意思吧
<14-5,RYAN>Let me just show you what I mean.

477
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,790
<14-5,RYAN>孩子们叠在一起
<14-5,RYAN>Okay, so, the kids -- They're stacked up,

478
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,670
<14-5,RYAN>然后绽放花朵  花朵
<14-5,RYAN>and then flower, flower.

479
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:14,680
<14-5,RYAN>他们迸发绽放开来
<14-5,RYAN>They're -- They're exploding, fanning out.

480
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:17,000
<14-5,RYAN>花朵  花朵  花朵
<14-5,RYAN>Flower, flower, flower!

481
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,890
<14-5,RYAN>很有趣
<14-5,RYAN>Fun!

482
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:21,120
<14-6,RYAN>*花儿朵朵向太阳*
<14-6,RYAN>*Flower growing in the sun*

483
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,260
<14-6,RYAN>然后他们再围成圈
<14-6,RYAN>And then -- then they circle back.

484
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:26,040
<14-6,RYAN>就像巴斯比·柏克萊[好莱坞著名编舞家]那样
<14-6,RYAN>Kind of a, you know, Busby Berkeley thing.

485
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:26,860
<14-6,RYAN>凯文
<14-6,RYAN>Kevin.

486
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,840
<14-7,ELODIE>凯文  最大的孩子才五岁
<14-7,ELODIE>Kevin. The oldest kids are 5.

487
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,690
<14-7,ELODIE>他们能唱出歌来就很好了
<14-7,ELODIE>We'll be lucky if they can just sing the song.

488
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:33,610
<14-8,RYAN>我觉得我们要跳出思维定势
<14-8,RYAN>I think we need to think outside the box here.

489
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:35,550
<14-9,ELODIE>明年再跳吧
<14-9,ELODIE>Think outside of the box next year,

490
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:37,390
<14-9,ELODIE>等我的孩子毕业了的
<14-9,ELODIE>after my kid has graduated.

491
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:40,270
<14-10,RYAN>艾洛蒂  你要是这样的话
<14-10,RYAN>Oh, well, hey, élodie, if you're gonna be like that,

492
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:42,650
<14-10,RYAN>我们说不定得在系统里查查
<14-10,RYAN>maybe we need to look into your unpaid parking tickets,

493
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:43,540
<14-10,RYAN>你未付的停车罚单
<14-10,RYAN>run them through the system...

494
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,900
<14-11,ESPOSITO>凯文
<14-11,ESPOSITO>Kevin.

495
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:47,610
<14-13,ESPOSITO>我们还得办案子
<14-13,ESPOSITO>We've got that, uh, case that we're working.

496
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:48,840
<14-14,ELODIE>好啦  再见
<14-14,ELODIE>Yeah, okay, bye.

497
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,130
<14-15,ESPOSITO>停下
<14-15,ESPOSITO>Stop.

498
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:52,180
<14-15,ESPOSITO>离开笔记本
<14-15,ESPOSITO>Step away from the laptop.

499
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,740
<15-1,BECKETT>对  就是赞恩向他购买
<15-1,BECKETT>Yeah, that's the same guy

500
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,790
<15-1,BECKETT>一次性手机的那个人
<15-1,BECKETT>that Zane bought the burner phone off of.

501
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:02,900
<15-2,RYAN>这个录像是四周之前
<15-2,RYAN>This footage is dated four weeks ago,

502
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,510
<15-2,RYAN>显然赞恩和他的交易一直在进行
<15-2,RYAN>so obviously he and Zane had an ongoing arrangement.

503
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,480
<15-3,ESPOSITO>等下  我认出这家伙了
<15-3,ESPOSITO>Hold up. I-I recognize this guy.

504
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,160
<15-3,ESPOSITO>没错  他是亚历桑德罗·古兹曼
<15-3,ESPOSITO>Yeah, that's Alejandro Guzman.

505
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,540
<15-3,ESPOSITO>他是一个
<15-3,ESPOSITO>He's a big shot-caller

506
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:16,480
<15-3,ESPOSITO>末日帮的老大
<15-3,ESPOSITO>for a gang called Los Malditos -- The Damned.

507
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,040
<15-3,ESPOSITO>他们在西班牙哈莱姆区活动
<15-3,ESPOSITO>They operate out of Spanish Harlem.

508
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,020
<15-4,BECKETT>就是赞恩从小生活的那片地区
<15-4,BECKETT>That's the same neighborhood that Zane grew up in.

509
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:22,290
<15-4,BECKETT>也许他们两个是老相识
<15-4,BECKETT>Maybe the two of them knew each other back in the day.

510
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:23,690
<15-5,RYAN>在赞恩拍《末日逃亡》系列影片
<15-5,RYAN>Before Zane got famous doing all those -

511
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:25,030
<15-5,RYAN>成名前就认识
<15-5,RYAN>"Apocalypse Runner" Movies.

00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:25,970
<15-5,RYAN>我们去西班牙哈莱姆区
<15-5,RYAN>We'll go up to Spanish Harlem

513
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,400
<15-5,RYAN>看能不能找到这个人
<15-5,RYAN>and see if we can track down this guy.

514
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,240
<16-1,GUZMAN>我什么都不知道
<16-1,GUZMAN>I know nothing about nothing.

515
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,240
<16-2,ESPOSITO>我们拍到了你和赞恩见面的录像
<16-2,ESPOSITO>Well, we got you on video having a meeting with Zane

516
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,210
<16-2,ESPOSITO>就在他被杀当天
<16-2,ESPOSITO>on the day he was murdered.

517
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:35,900
<16-3,GUZMAN>你们拍到我杀死他了吗
<16-3,GUZMAN>You got me on video killing him?

518
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,930
<16-3,GUZMAN>我就说嘛  我能走了吗
<16-3,GUZMAN>Yeah, that's what I thought. May I go?

519
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:40,140
<16-4,ESPOSITO>-还不行  -不行
<16-4,ESPOSITO>- Not yet. - No.

520
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:41,310
<16-6,ESPOSITO>看看我们做了调查
<16-6,ESPOSITO>See, we did our homework.

521
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,710
<16-7,RYAN>我们知道你的小兄弟安东尼奥
<16-7,RYAN>Yeah, we know that - your little brother Antonio

522
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:46,120
<16-7,RYAN>在州北菲什基尔坐牢
<16-7,RYAN>is doing a little stretch upstate at Fishkill.

523
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:49,700
<16-8,ESPOSITO>你妈妈去探视的路途十分遥远
<16-8,ESPOSITO>That's a long way for your mother to travel on visiting day,

524
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:51,270
<16-8,ESPOSITO>特别是她膝盖还不好
<16-8,ESPOSITO>especially with her bad knees.

525
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,670
<16-9,GUZMAN>你怎么知道我妈的
<16-9,GUZMAN>How do you know about my mama?

526
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:54,910
<16-10,ESPOSITO>我在军队一个老朋友
<16-10,ESPOSITO>Oh, I, uh -- I got an old Army buddy

527
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,990
<16-10,ESPOSITO>在联邦监狱局工作
<16-10,ESPOSITO>who works for the Federal Bureau of Prisons.

528
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,400
<16-10,ESPOSITO>他给了我你的档案
<16-10,ESPOSITO>He slipped me your file.

529
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,030
<16-11,RYAN>哈维  我打赌你的军队朋友
<16-11,RYAN>Hey, Javi, I bet your old Army buddy

530
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:02,520
<16-11,RYAN>能把他兄弟转到近一点的监狱
<16-11,RYAN>could get his brother transferred closer to the city,

531
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,450
<16-11,RYAN>让他妈妈探视起来方便点
<16-11,RYAN>make those visits a little easier on mama.

532
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:06,240
<16-12,ESPOSITO>是的  但他必须得愿意开口
<16-12,ESPOSITO>Yeah, but he'd have to be willing to talk.

533
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:08,170
<16-13,RYAN>我不跟警察做交易
<16-13,RYAN>I don't make deals with police.

534
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:09,730
<16-14,GUZMAN>那没事
<16-14,GUZMAN>Oh, that's -- that's fine.

535
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:13,440
<16-15,ESPOSITO>我朋友还说了  佐治亚州的联邦监狱
<16-15,ESPOSITO>My buddy also tells me that there's a bunch of openings

536
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,210
<16-15,ESPOSITO>还有很多空缺
<16-15,ESPOSITO>at a federal penitentiary in Georgia.

537
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:17,240
<16-16,RYAN>这估计就得13到14个小时的车程
<16-16,RYAN>It would be, like, what, a 13-, 14-hour bus ride?

538
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:17,940
<16-17,ESPOSITO>至少啦
<16-17,ESPOSITO>At least.

539
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,390
<16-18,RYAN>妈妈好辛苦
<16-18,RYAN>Kind of rough on mama.

540
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:20,810
<16-18,RYAN>好吧
<16-18,RYAN>All right.

541
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,120
<16-19,GUZMAN>我会说说赞恩  但是我不能说名字
<16-19,GUZMAN>I'll talk about Zane, but I'm not giving you names.

542
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,960
<16-19,GUZMAN>我不能出卖任何一名手下
<16-19,GUZMAN>I'm not ratting anyone out in my crew.

543
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:27,890
<16-19,GUZMAN>接着说吧
<16-19,GUZMAN>Keep talking.

544
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,810
<16-19,GUZMAN>我很早就认识赞恩
<16-19,GUZMAN>I knew Zane back in the day.

545
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,870
<16-19,GUZMAN>就是街头小混混一个
<16-19,GUZMAN>Just a neighborhood punk.

546
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,940
<16-19,GUZMAN>一个月前  他突然出现了
<16-19,GUZMAN>A month ago, he shows up out of the blue

547
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,680
<16-19,GUZMAN>想要见我的老大
<16-19,GUZMAN>asking to get in touch with my boss.

548
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:36,680
<16-20,RYAN>你老大是谁
<16-20,RYAN>Who's your boss?

549
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:42,010
<16-21,ESPOSITO>等等  你是说真正的老大
<16-21,ESPOSITO>Hold up, are you talking about...the boss boss?

550
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:43,240
<16-21,ESPOSITO>枭熊吗
<16-21,ESPOSITO>El Oso?

551
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,560
<16-22,GUZMAN>我说了不透露姓名
<16-22,GUZMAN>I said no names.

552
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,350
<16-23,RYAN>等等  枭熊  贩毒集团的头头
<16-23,RYAN>Wait, El Oso? Head of the cartel?

553
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:49,200
<16-23,RYAN>墨西哥政府  缉毒局  联邦调查局
<16-23,RYAN>The Mexican government, the D.E.A., the FBI --

554
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:49,990
<16-23,RYAN>都在找这个人
<16-23,RYAN>They're all looking for this guy.

555
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:52,350
<16-23,RYAN>他三个月前从墨西哥监狱逃脱
<16-23,RYAN>He escaped from prison in Mexico three months ago.

556
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,890
<16-23,RYAN>你是说你知道枭熊的藏身之处吗
<16-23,RYAN>Are -- Are you saying that you know where El Oso is hiding?

557
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:56,640
<16-24,GUZMAN>当然不知道
<16-24,GUZMAN>Of course not.

558
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,150
<16-25,ESPOSITO>那赞恩为什么要去见你
<16-25,ESPOSITO>Then why would Zane come to see you?

559
00:19:58,210 --> 00:19:59,760
<16-26,GUZMAN>因为我手上有消息灵通的人
<16-26,GUZMAN>Because I got a little bird,

560
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,040
<16-26,GUZMAN>我把他们安插到合适的人身边
<16-26,GUZMAN>and I put out my little bird to the right people

561
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,960
<16-26,GUZMAN>直到消息传到那个人
<16-26,GUZMAN>until the message gets to you know who.

562
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:07,590
<16-27,RYAN>很明显你这种消息服务要收费吧
<16-27,RYAN>Clearly, you charge - for this little-bird service.

563
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:09,570
<16-28,GUZMAN>一万美金可以买到一个一次性手机
<16-28,GUZMAN>10 grand gets you a burner.

564
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,960
<16-28,GUZMAN>要是老大想跟你谈  你就能接到一个电话
<16-28,GUZMAN>If the boss wants to talk, you get a phone call.

565
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,410
<16-29,RYAN>一个月前  赞恩想跟你的老大谈话
<16-29,RYAN>And a month ago, Zane wanted to talk to your boss.

566
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:14,960
<16-29,RYAN>为什么
<16-29,RYAN>Why?

567
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,740
<16-30,GUZMAN>某种生意上的提议
<16-30,GUZMAN>Some kind of business proposition.

568
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:20,330
<16-30,GUZMAN>赞恩甚至让老大跟他面对面地谈事情
<16-30,GUZMAN>Zane even got himself a face-to-face with the boss

569
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:22,510
<16-30,GUZMAN>因为他确实还是个电影明星
<16-30,GUZMAN>'cause he's a movie star and all.

570
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:25,320
<16-30,GUZMAN>只是据我所知  事情进展地并不顺利
<16-30,GUZMAN>Only, from what I hear, it didn't go so good.

571
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,420
<16-31,ESPOSITO>为什么赞恩被害那天
<16-31,ESPOSITO>So why did Zane buy another burner from you

572
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,380
<16-31,ESPOSITO>还从你手上买了一次性手机
<16-31,ESPOSITO>on the day he was killed?

573
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,330
<16-31,ESPOSITO>我不清楚
<16-31,ESPOSITO>I don't know.

574
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:32,030
<16-32,GUZMAN>但要是他再惹老大不高兴
<16-32,GUZMAN>But if he pissed off the boss a second time,

575
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:34,130
<16-32,GUZMAN>最后死于非命可不能怨我
<16-32,GUZMAN>it's not on me he ended up dead.

576
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:36,520
<16-32,GUZMAN>豪尔赫 "枭熊" 扎马克纳
<16-32,GUZMAN>Jorge "El Oso" Zamacona.

577
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,900
<17-1,ESPOSITO>他既是民族英雄也是魔鬼更是心狠手辣的禽兽
<17-1,ESPOSITO>He's part folk hero, part demon, the rest pure monster.

578
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,670
<17-2,RYAN>这家伙会杀掉任何与他敌对的人
<17-2,RYAN>The man kills anyone who crosses him --

579
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:44,900
<17-2,RYAN>警察  记者还有政客
<17-2,RYAN>cops, journalists, politicians.

580
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,600
<17-3,BECKETT>赞恩肯定是极度缺钱
<17-3,BECKETT>Zane must have been real desperate for money

581
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,320
<17-3,BECKETT>才想着要和这种人做交易
<17-3,BECKETT>to want to do business with this guy.

582
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:51,230
<17-4,CASTLE>也许他想充当枭熊在好莱坞新的毒品渠道
<17-4,CASTLE>Maybe he wanted to be El Oso's new drug pipeline to Hollywood.

583
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:52,690
<17-5,RYAN>也许我们永远都不会知道了
<17-5,RYAN>Well, chances are we'll never find out.

584
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:56,240
<17-5,RYAN>我是说如果缉毒局联邦调查局
<17-5,RYAN>I mean, if the D.E.A., FBI, and the Mexican government

585
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,170
<17-5,RYAN>还有墨西哥政府都找不到他
<17-5,RYAN>can't find him,

586
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:58,410
<17-5,RYAN>我们怎么有机会找得到
<17-5,RYAN>then what chances do we have?

587
00:20:58,410 --> 00:20:59,760
<17-6,BECKETT>我会联系我在联邦调查局的熟人
<17-6,BECKETT>I'll reach out to my Fed contacts.

588
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,330
<17-7,ESPOSITO>我们会继续调查枭熊在美国的所有联系
<17-7,ESPOSITO>Well, we'll drill down all of El Oso's stateside connections.

589
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:03,110
<17-8,BECKETT>好的
<17-8,BECKETT>Okay.

590
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:10,580
<17-9,CASTLE>我想我们的约会之夜要先推迟了

<19-5,CASTLE>枭熊
<19-5,CASTLE>El Oso.

629
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:17,380
<19-5,CASTLE>听着你给我一条扎马克纳的线索
<19-5,CASTLE>Listen, you get me a lead on Zamacona,

630
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,770
<20-1,BECKETT>我们会查下去的
<20-1,BECKETT>and we will run it.

631
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:19,640
<20-1,BECKETT>好的
<20-1,BECKETT>Yeah.

632
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:21,280
<20-1,BECKETT>好  我要挂了  再见
<20-1,BECKETT>Okay, I got to go. Bye.

633
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,420
<20-3,MARTHA>你好  亲爱的
<20-3,MARTHA>Hi, darling.

634
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,930
<20-3,MARTHA>我知道你很忙  但理查德在这吗
<20-3,MARTHA>I know you're busy, but is Richard here?

635
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:27,030
<20-4,BECKETT>没有  我以为他在跟你吃饭
<20-4,BECKETT>No. I thought he was at dinner with you.

636
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,760
<20-5,MARTHA>但他没有来
<20-5,MARTHA>Yeah, well, he didn't show up,

637
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,350
<20-5,MARTHA>他的电话直接就是语音信箱
<20-5,MARTHA>and his cell went right to voicemail.

638
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:33,120
<20-5,MARTHA>所以我想他肯定还在专注地查案子
<20-5,MARTHA>So I figured he must be here immersed in the case.

639
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,330
<20-6,BECKETT>也有可能他在赏玩他的高级信用卡
<20-6,BECKETT>Well, he's probably out playing with his fancy new credit card,

640
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,140
<20-6,BECKETT>我来看下他在哪
<20-6,BECKETT>but let me check in on him.

641
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:40,850
<20-6,BECKETT>阿丽克西斯在我电脑上装了个新的追踪软件
<20-6,BECKETT>Alexis put new tracking software on my laptop.

642
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:42,990
<20-6,BECKETT>我定位一下他的手机
<20-6,BECKETT>I'll just ping his cell.

643
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:43,900
<20-6,BECKETT>可以了
<20-6,BECKETT>There we go.

645
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:48,580
<20-6,BECKETT>找到了  在7号大街与53号街之间
<20-6,BECKETT>There we go. 7th and 53rd.

646
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:50,870
<20-7,MARTHA>这个停车场就在
<20-7,MARTHA>That's the parking garage across from the restaurant

647
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:53,620
<20-7,MARTHA>一个小时前我们约好吃饭的那家餐厅对面
<20-7,MARTHA>where we were supposed to meet an hour ago.

648
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:58,250
<20-8,BECKETT>等我一下
<20-8,BECKETT>Uh, you know what? Just give me a second.

649
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,770
<20-8,BECKETT>我是贝克特警监
<20-8,BECKETT>Hi, uh, this is Captain Beckett.

650
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:01,770
<20-8,BECKETT>我想调出53号与7号大街的监控
<20-8,BECKETT>I need a unit at 53rd and 7th.

651
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:03,650
<21-1,ZAMACONA>我在新闻上看到你了
<21-1,ZAMACONA>I saw you on the news.

652
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,050
<21-1,ZAMACONA>你跟联邦的人一起
<21-1,ZAMACONA>You're working with the Federales

653
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,790
<21-1,ZAMACONA>在调查赞恩·卡侬的死
<21-1,ZAMACONA>to investigate Zane Cannon's death.

654
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:09,190
<21-2,CASTLE>你是说他被谋杀的案子
<21-2,CASTLE>You mean his murder.

655
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,570
<21-2,CASTLE>我是说我们知道赞恩
<21-2,CASTLE>Well, I mean, uh, we know that Zane,

656
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:13,650
<21-2,CASTLE>跟你有联系
<21-2,CASTLE>uh, was in contact with you

657
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:14,890
<21-2,CASTLE>在谈一项生意上的提议
<21-2,CASTLE>about a business proposition

658
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:17,340
<21-2,CASTLE>在他英明早逝几个小时前
<21-2,CASTLE>and that you were in contact with him

659
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:20,070
<21-2,CASTLE>你跟他有过联系
<21-2,CASTLE>just hours before his un-untimely demise.

660
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:21,460
<21-3,ZAMACONA>你以为是我杀了他
<21-3,ZAMACONA>You think I killed him.

661
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,770
<21-4,CASTLE>我们想到了你
<21-4,CASTLE>You have been associated

662
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:26,540
<21-4,CASTLE>毕竟你的过去有着相当多的暴力事件
<21-4,CASTLE>with a fair amount of violence in your past. -

663
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:31,490
<21-5,ZAMACONA>我想你是想说"史诗般的"
<21-5,ZAMACONA>I believe the adjective you're looking for is, uh, "Epic."

664
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,280
<21-5,ZAMACONA>史诗般的诸多暴力
<21-5,ZAMACONA>An epic amount of violence.

665
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,810
<21-5,ZAMACONA>有些人甚至说如《圣经》一般
<21-5,ZAMACONA>Some might even say biblical.

666
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:40,320
<21-6,CASTLE>所以你也明白为什么你和赞恩打交道
<21-6,CASTLE>So you can see why your involvement with Zane

667
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,880
<21-6,CASTLE>会引起警方的注意吧
<21-6,CASTLE>would have the police curious.

668
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,250
<21-7,ZAMACONA>如果我想杀他
<21-7,ZAMACONA>If I wanted him dead, I would have cut him open

669
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:46,400
<21-7,ZAMACONA>早在他站在你现在这个位置时我就下手了
<21-7,ZAMACONA>when he was standing where you are now.

670
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,900
<21-7,ZAMACONA>我也不会用一支笔杀他
<21-7,ZAMACONA>I wouldn't kill him with a pen.

671
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,450
<21-7,ZAMACONA>那太可爱了
<21-7,ZAMACONA>That's cute.

672
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:51,340
<21-7,ZAMACONA>我看起来像是会用可爱的方式杀人吗
<21-7,ZAMACONA>Do I look like a man who kills cute?

673
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,680
<21-8,CASTLE>当然不像
<21-8,CASTLE>No. No, certainly not.

674
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,480
<21-8,CASTLE>你看起来也不像是
<21-8,CASTLE>You also don't look like the sort of man

675
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,730
<21-8,CASTLE>会用低级的方式吓唬人
<21-8,CASTLE>who needs to resort to cheap scare tactics.

676
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:58,270
<21-8,CASTLE>所以  要不先给我松绑了吧
<21-8,CASTLE>I mean, why don't you just untie me?

677
00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:02,330
<21-8,CASTLE>我们坐下来  你告诉我为什么绑我来这
<21-8,CASTLE>We'll sit down, and you tell me why you brought me here.

678
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:16,250
<21-9,CASTLE>谢谢
<21-9,CASTLE>Thank you.

679
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:19,440
<21-10,ZAMACONA>你们以为赞恩联系我是为了毒品对吗
<21-10,ZAMACONA>You think Zane contacted me about drugs, no?

680
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,400
<21-11,CASTLE>要不然呢
<21-11,CASTLE>What else is there?

681
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,970
<21-12,ZAMACONA>是为了我  枭熊
<21-12,ZAMACONA>Yo. Yo mismo. El Oso.

682
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:27,670
<21-12,ZAMACONA>史上最声名狼藉的黑帮老大
<21-12,ZAMACONA>The most infamous cartel boss in history.

683
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:30,660
<21-13,CASTLE>赞恩想获得你的传记版权
<21-13,CASTLE>Zane wanted the rights to your life story--

684
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,090
<21-13,CASTLE>枭熊传记电影
<21-13,CASTLE>the El Oso biopic.

685
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:35,120
<21-14,ZAMACONA>他觉得饰演我会让他赢得奥斯卡奖
<21-14,ZAMACONA>He thought portraying me would win him an Oscar.

686
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,070
<21-15,CASTLE>-那你怎么回应的呢  -我拒绝了
<21-15,CASTLE>- So what happened? - I said no.

687
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,800
<21-16,ZAMACONA>他可能是很有票房号召力
<21-16,ZAMACONA>He may be big box office,

688
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,870
<21-16,ZAMACONA>但那家伙根本不会演戏
<21-16,ZAMACONA>but the man cannot act.

689
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:43,050
<21-16,ZAMACONA>他成名是因为出演了
<21-16,ZAMACONA>He got upstaged by a CGI aardvark

690
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:45,170
<21-16,ZAMACONA>奇幻电影里的一只土豚
<21-16,ZAMACONA>in that película De fantasía.

691
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:48,150
<21-16,ZAMACONA>所以我对他提出了一个条件
<21-16,ZAMACONA>So I-I made him an ultimatum.

692
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:49,980
<21-17,CASTLE>是你让他辞演《安全之词》
<21-17,CASTLE>You're the one who made him drop "Safe Word"

693
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:50,740
<21-17,CASTLE>而去演《哈姆雷特》的
<21-17,CASTLE>and do "Hamlet."

694
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:52,860
<21-18,ZAMACONA>我得确保他是有实力的
<21-18,ZAMACONA>I needed to see that he was serious.

695
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,170
<21-18,ZAMACONA>他确实能演戏
<21-18,ZAMACONA>That he really could act.

696
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:55,930
<21-18,ZAMACONA>所以我跟他说
<21-18,ZAMACONA>So I told him

697
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,960
<21-18,ZAMACONA>如果他能在《时代周刊》上获得好评
<21-18,ZAMACONA>if he got a good review in the Times,

698
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,470
<21-18,ZAMACONA>我就把传记版权给他
<21-18,ZAMACONA>my life rights were his.

699
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:03,320
<21-19,CASTLE>但他不是在演出首次公映前就联系你了吗
<21-19,CASTLE>But he had contact with you before the show premiered.

700
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,370
<21-20,ZAMACONA>他想再见一次面
<21-20,ZAMACONA>He wanted to meet again.

701
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:05,290
<21-21,CASTLE>-为什么  -我不知道
<21-21,CASTLE>- Why? - I don't know.

702
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:07,770
<21-22,ZAMACONA>他说是跟电影有关的事
<21-22,ZAMACONA>He said it had to do with the movie,

703
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:11,110
<21-22,ZAMACONA>但我从电话里能听出他很绝望
<21-22,ZAMACONA>but I could smell his, uh, desperation through the phone,

704
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:12,860
<21-22,ZAMACONA>特别是在我拒绝他之后
<21-22,ZAMACONA>especially when I said no.

705
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:15,060
<21-22,ZAMACONA>那夜晚些时候  他就死了
<21-22,ZAMACONA>And later that night, he was dead.

706
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,230
<21-22,ZAMACONA>听着  我绑你来这
<21-22,ZAMACONA>Pero Mira. I didn't bring you all the way out here

707
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:19,770
<21-22,ZAMACONA>不是为了跟你谈论死者
<21-22,ZAMACONA>to talk about Los muertos.

708
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:20,270
<21-23,CASTLE>不是吗
<21-23,CASTLE>You didn't?

709
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:21,270
<21-24,ZAMACONA>不是
<21-24,ZAMACONA>No, no, no, no.

710
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,910
<21-25,ZAMACONA>当我在电视上看到你时
<21-25,ZAMACONA>When I saw you on television,

711
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:27,920
<21-25,ZAMACONA>我就知道命运安排了你进入我的人生
<21-25,ZAMACONA>I knew fate had put you in my path,

712
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,090
<21-25,ZAMACONA>理查德·卡塞尔
<21-25,ZAMACONA>Richard Castle.

713
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,640
<21-25,ZAMACONA>我是平民出身
<21-25,ZAMACONA>I'm a man of the people.

714
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,810
<21-25,ZAMACONA>你是畅销书作家  你为平民写作
<21-25,ZAMACONA>You are a popular writer. You write for the people.

715
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:35,900
<21-25,ZAMACONA>所以必须由你来书写我的故事
<21-25,ZAMACONA>That's why you must tell my story.

716
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,250
<21-26,CASTLE>你想要我为你的电影写剧本
<21-26,CASTLE>You want me to write the script for your movie?

717
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:41,120
<21-27,ZAMACONA>对  会很好玩的
<21-27,ZAMACONA>Sí! Sí! It will be fun!

718
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,700
<21-27,ZAMACONA>我会把我所有的故事告诉你
<21-27,ZAMACONA>I-I will tell you all about myself.

719
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,650
<21-27,ZAMACONA>然后你写就是了
<21-27,ZAMACONA>And then you will just typey, typey, typey.

720
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,580
<21-27,ZAMACONA>大概半年就能完成  可能一年
<21-27,ZAMACONA>It should only take six months, maybe a year.

721
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:51,460
<21-27,ZAMACONA>你会跟我一起待在这里
<21-27,ZAMACONA>And you will stay here with me!

722
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:58,150
<21-28,ZAMACONA>否则我会把你的尸体寄回家
<21-28,ZAMACONA>Or I will mail your body home...

723
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,030
<21-28,ZAMACONA>一块一块地
<21-28,ZAMACONA>piece by piece.

724
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,520
<22-1,ESPOSITO>我们拿到了停车场的监控录像
<22-1,ESPOSITO>We got security footage from the garage,

725
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,700
<22-1,ESPOSITO>情况不太妙
<22-1,ESPOSITO>and it's not good.

726
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:07,990
<22-2,MARTHA>天啊
<22-2,MARTHA>Oh, my...

727
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:10,230
<22-2,MARTHA>老天啊
<22-2,MARTHA>Oh, my God.

728
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,140
<22-3,RYAN>那辆车登记在一家空壳公司名下
<22-3,RYAN>The Escalade is registered to a shell corp

729
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,930
<22-3,RYAN>而且是枭熊的幌子公司
<22-3,RYAN>that's a known front for El Oso.

730
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:19,950
<22-4,MARTHA>你们能追踪到那辆车对吧
<22-4,MARTHA>You can track the SUV, can't you?

731
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:22,300
<22-5,BECKETT>我们可以  但估计他们现在已经
<22-5,BECKETT>We can, but they probably swapped cars

732
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,550
<22-5,BECKETT>不止换过一次车了
<22-5,BECKETT>at least once by now,

733
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:24,930
<22-5,BECKETT>而且现在已经过了两小时
<22-5,BECKETT>and with a two-hour head start,

734
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:26,740
<22-5,BECKETT>搜寻范围已扩至方圆一百公里
<22-5,BECKETT>we're looking at a 100-mile search radius,

735
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:29,030
<22-5,BECKETT>但我们至今为止连目标都没有
<22-5,BECKETT>and we still have no idea what we're looking for.

736
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:31,290
<22-6,MARTHA>你们总能做点什么吧
<22-6,MARTHA>There must be something that you can do.

737
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:33,640
<22-6,MARTHA>理查德命在旦夕呀
<22-6,MARTHA>This -- This is Richard's life.

738
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:35,150
<22-7,BECKETT>YOLO
<22-7,BECKETT>YOLO.

739
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,400
<22-8,ESPOSITO>你太无情了  贝克特
<22-8,ESPOSITO>That's cold, Beckett.

740
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,260
<22-8,ESPOSITO>不  是卡塞尔的新信用卡
<22-8,ESPOSITO>No, uh, Castle's new credit card.

741
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,320
<22-9,BECKETT>绑架者把他的手机落在车里
<22-9,BECKETT>The kidnappers left his cellphone by the car,

742
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,430
<22-9,BECKETT>但他的钱包可能还在身上
<22-9,BECKETT>but he might still have his wallet with him.

743
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:43,740
<22-9,BECKETT>新YOLO卡上
<22-9,BECKETT>And the new YOLO card

744
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,300
<22-9,BECKETT>安装了升级版的无线射频识别芯片
<22-9,BECKETT>has an upgraded RFID chip in it.

745
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:47,720
<22-10,RYAN>所以如果他们经过了收费站或加油站
<22-10,RYAN>And if they passed within range of a tollbooth or a gas station...

746
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,430
<22-11,BECKETT>芯片就会被识别
<22-11,BECKETT>Then it'll pick up the chip,

747
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:49,610
<22-11,BECKETT>我们就能追踪到他了
<22-11,BECKETT>and we'll be able to track his movement.

748
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:50,690
<22-12,ESPOSITO>好  我去打电话给信用卡公司
<22-12,ESPOSITO>All right, I'll call the credit-card company,

749
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:52,340
<22-12,ESPOSITO>看看那张卡有没有在哪被识别到
<22-12,ESPOSITO>see if that card's pinged anywhere.

750
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:55,540
<22-13,MARTHA>可怜的理查德
<22-13,MARTHA>Oh, poor Richard.

751
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:59,050
<22-13,MARTHA>我都不敢想象他现在正遭受着怎样的折磨
<22-13,MARTHA>I-I-I can't even imagine how he must be suffering.

752
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:06,280
<23-1,CASTLE>你的人生简直就是部莎士比亚戏剧
<23-1,CASTLE>Your life is, without a doubt, a Shakespearean drama.

754
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:09,420
<23-2,ZAMACONA>我一直都觉得我和麦克白很像
<23-2,ZAMACONA>I've always felt - a strong connection to Macbeth.

755
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:14,010
<23-2,ZAMACONA>野心勃勃  但被良心折磨着
<23-2,ZAMACONA>Ambitious, but tortured by his conscience.

756
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,540
<23-3,CASTLE>从你造成的诸多磨难来看
<23-3,CASTLE>With your relationship to torture,

757
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:17,950
<23-3,CASTLE>莎士比亚戏剧中的角色
<23-3,CASTLE>是一个跛足驼背  面容扭曲  内心邪恶的阴谋家和篡位暴君

758
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:17,950
<23-3,CASTLE>我觉得你更像理查三世  你说对吗
<23-3,CASTLE>I think you're a little more Richard III, am I right?

759
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:22,590
<23-4,ZAMACONA>那个驼子
<23-4,ZAMACONA>The hunchback?

761
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:24,870
<23-5,CASTLE>我是说更像劳伦斯·奥利弗爵士
<23-5,CASTLE>I-I was thinking more along the lines of

762
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,080
<23-5,CASTLE>饰演的那个理查三世
<23-5,CASTLE>Sir Laurence Olivier.

763
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:28,790
<23-6,ZAMACONA>有我这般成就
<23-6,ZAMACONA>A man does not achieve what I have

764
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,780
<23-6,ZAMACONA>必然要血染双手
<23-6,ZAMACONA>without great personal cost!

765
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:33,620
<23-7,CASTLE>豪尔赫  我的意思是
<23-7,CASTLE>Jorge, I-I only meant you --

766
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:36,760
<23-8,ZAMACONA>你以为我也
<23-8,ZAMACONA>Do you think I cannot see

767
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:40,540
<23-8,ZAMACONA>对出现在袖子上的灵魂污点视而不见吗
<23-8,ZAMACONA>that the stains on my soul appear upon my sleeve, as well?

768
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:43,240
<23-8,ZAMACONA>你是胆敢对所侍奉的国王冷嘲热讽的
<23-8,ZAMACONA>Are you the royal fool who dares believe

769
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,990
<23-8,ZAMACONA>那个宫廷小丑吗
<23-8,ZAMACONA>he can mock the king he serves?

770
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:46,940
<23-9,CASTLE>不  我是那种滑稽的宫廷小丑
<23-9,CASTLE>No, I'm just the funny kind of court jester.

771
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:51,770
<23-10,ZAMACONA>那你就以死明志吧
<23-10,ZAMACONA>Then give me proof of your humility by giving me your life!

772
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:58,680
<23-11,ZAMACONA>理查德
<23-11,ZAMACONA>Oh, Ricardo!

773
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,980
<23-11,ZAMACONA>真希望你能看到自己现在的表情
<23-11,ZAMACONA>I wish you could see your face!

774
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:03,880
<23-11,ZAMACONA>如此独一无二
<23-11,ZAMACONA>It's priceless!

775
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:05,650
<23-12,CASTLE>你演得太好了
<23-12,CASTLE>Yes, good one.

776
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:08,000
<23-13,ZAMACONA>理查三世没有幽默感
<23-13,ZAMACONA>Richard III had no sense of humor,

777
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:09,410
<23-13,ZAMACONA>但我有幽默感
<23-13,ZAMACONA>but I do.

778
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:12,740
<23-13,ZAMACONA>你必须抓住我性格的这些方面
<23-13,ZAMACONA>These are the facets of -- of my character that you must capture.

779
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:16,330
<23-14,CASTLE>你真应该在电影里演你自己
<23-14,CASTLE>You know, you should really play yourself in this movie.

780
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:17,790
<23-15,ZAMACONA>要是那样就好了
<23-15,ZAMACONA>Oh, if only...

781
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:22,030
<23-15,ZAMACONA>只可惜我是个逃犯
<23-15,ZAMACONA>But sadly, I'm a fugitive,

782
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:24,830
<23-15,ZAMACONA>被人迫害  被人误解
<23-15,ZAMACONA>persecuted and misunderstood.

783
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:27,520
<23-15,ZAMACONA>直到你向世人展示我的本来面目
<23-15,ZAMACONA>Until you tell my story, that is.

784
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,280
<23-15,ZAMACONA>现在说一下报酬吧
<23-15,ZAMACONA>Now let's talk money, huh?

785
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:39,120
<23-16,ZAMACONA>五百万够吗
<23-16,ZAMACONA>Will $5 million be enough?

786
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:45,120
<23-17,AGENT RICHMOND>豪尔赫·扎马克纳  我们是缉毒局
<23-17,AGENT RICHMOND>Jorge Zamacona, this is the D.E.A.

787
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:47,130
<23-17,AGENT RICHMOND>你已经被包围了
<23-17,AGENT RICHMOND>We have you surrounded.

788
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:49,340
<23-17,AGENT RICHMOND>等一下  别这样
<23-17,AGENT RICHMOND>Whoa, whoa, whoa! No, no, no, no!

789
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,100
<23-18,CASTLE>豪尔赫  等一下
<23-18,CASTLE>Jorge, wait, wait, wait!

790
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,690
<23-18,CASTLE>你记得《理查三世》的结局
<23-18,CASTLE>You remember how "Richard III" ended.

791
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:53,230
<23-18,CASTLE>你可以亲手改写自己的结局
<23-18,CASTLE>You could write your own ending here.

792
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:56,870
<23-19,ZAMACONA>艺术家必须忠于现实生活和自己的内心
<23-19,ZAMACONA>An artist must be true to the material and himself.

793
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:22,710
<23-20,ZAMACONA>打开出口
<23-20,ZAMACONA>Open the hatch!

794
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,380
<23-21,MAN>在这边
<23-21,MAN>Hey, over there!

795
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,010
<23-22,MAN>他摔倒了  他摔倒了
<23-22,MAN>He's down! He's down!

796
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:45,170
<23-23,MAN>击倒了三人  卡塞尔在这里
<23-23,MAN>Three down. Castle's here.

797
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:46,050
<23-24,MAN>卡塞尔先生  你受伤了吗
<23-24,MAN>Are you hurt, Mr. Castle?

798
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:47,820
<23-25,CASTLE>没有  我没事  我很好
<23-25,CASTLE>No, I'm fine. I'm fine. I...

799
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:51,130
<23-26,CASTLE>但是可能好不了多久了
<23-26,CASTLE>But I may not be for long.

800
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:53,420
<24-1,CASTLE>那只是本能反应
<24-1,CASTLE>It was just instinct.

801
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:55,500
<24-1,CASTLE>他从我身边跑过去  我就把他绊倒了
<24-1,CASTLE>He was running by, and I tripped him.

802
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,670
<24-2,RYAN>-你做的很好  卡塞尔  -哪里好
<24-2,RYAN>- You did good, Castle. - No, not good!

803
00:30:57,670 --> 00:30:58,740
<24-3,CASTLE>一点都不好
<24-3,CASTLE>I -- Not good at all!

804
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:01,310
<24-3,CASTLE>我绊倒了一个毒枭大佬
<24-3,CASTLE>I tripped a drug lord.

805
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:02,600
<24-3,CASTLE>他是因为我才被抓的
<24-3,CASTLE>It's my fault he got caught.

806
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,960
<24-4,BECKETT>缉毒局已经把整栋楼包围了
<24-4,BECKETT>The D.E.A. had the building surrounded.

807
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,190
<24-4,BECKETT>就算你没绊倒他  枭熊也跑不掉的
<24-4,BECKETT>El Oso wasn't getting away, even if you didn't trip him.

808
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:09,740
<24-5,RYAN>可惜  虽然你被绑架的故事很精彩
<24-5,RYAN>Sadly, despite your abduction being a fantastic story,

809
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:12,110
<24-5,RYAN>对找到杀害赞恩的凶手还是没什么帮助
<24-5,RYAN>we're still no closer to finding out who killed Zane.

810
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:13,740
<24-6,ESPOSITO>我看未必
<24-6,ESPOSITO>I wouldn't be so sure about that.

811
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:17,060
<24-6,ESPOSITO>缉毒局从枭熊的仓房里抄出一打一次性手机
<24-6,ESPOSITO>The D.E.A. confiscated a dozen burner phones from El Oso's barn.

812
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:19,170
<24-6,ESPOSITO>其中就有他在赞恩被害当天
<24-6,ESPOSITO>One of those phones was the one he used to call Zane

813
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:20,270
<24-6,ESPOSITO>给他打电话用的那个
<24-6,ESPOSITO>the day he was killed.

814
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:21,930
<24-7,BECKETT>所以他们有赞恩的一次性电话号码
<24-7,BECKETT>So they have Zane's burner phone number,

815
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:24,110
<24-7,BECKETT>那我们就可以查出他有没有给其他人打过电话了
<24-7,BECKETT>which means we could find out if he called anyone else.

816
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:25,630
<24-8,ESPOSITO>是的  他打了
<24-8,ESPOSITO>We can, and he did.

817
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:27,030
<24-8,ESPOSITO>打给墨西哥的国际长途
<24-8,ESPOSITO>An international line in Mexico,

818
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:29,500
<24-8,ESPOSITO>你们很难相信是打给谁的
<24-8,ESPOSITO>and you won't believe who it belongs to --

819
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,110
<24-8,ESPOSITO>枭熊的弟弟  海克托·扎马克纳
<24-8,ESPOSITO>El Oso's younger brother, Hector Zamacona,

821
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:33,220
<24-8,ESPOSITO>他是个遵纪守法的商人
<24-8,ESPOSITO>a legit businessman

822
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:35,850
<24-8,ESPOSITO>只要有机会就会公开谴责枭熊
<24-8,ESPOSITO>who publicly condemns El Oso every chance he gets.

823
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:38,490
<24-9,RYAN>他要是在墨西哥  赞恩怎么和他联系
<24-9,RYAN>If he's in Mexico, how did Zane connect with him?

824
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:40,890
<24-10,ESPOSITO>赞恩那通电话的两端
<24-10,ESPOSITO>Both ends of that call from Zane's phone

825
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:42,740
<24-10,ESPOSITO>都经过了本市的信号塔
<24-10,ESPOSITO>pinged off of towers here in the city.

826
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:43,640
<24-10,ESPOSITO>小弟就在市里呢
<24-10,ESPOSITO>Baby bro's in town.

827
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,140
<24-11,BECKETT>-我们知道他现在的位置吗  -还不清楚
<24-11,BECKETT>- Do we know where he is now? - Not yet.

828
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,410
<24-12,ESPOSITO>海克托·扎马克纳可能是
<24-12,ESPOSITO>Hector Zamacona might have been

829
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:47,870
<24-13,BECKETT>赞恩生前最后一个讲过话的人
<24-13,BECKETT>the last person to speak to Zane,

830
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:50,080
<24-13,BECKETT>所以他可能会知道些什么
<24-13,BECKETT>which means he may know something.

832
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,230
<24-14,ESPOSITO>你老婆怎么来了
<24-14,ESPOSITO>Hey, what's your wife doing here?

833
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:54,840
<24-15,RYAN>我不知道  失陪一下
<24-15,RYAN>I don't know. Excuse me.

834
00:31:58,650 --> 00:31:59,860
<25-1,RYAN>怎么了
<25-1,RYAN>So, what's up?

835
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,420
<25-2,JENNY>幼儿园的艾洛蒂找我谈了舞台剧的事
<25-2,JENNY>éLodie from the preschool called about the play.

836
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:06,790
<25-2,JENNY>有的家长好像有些担心
<25-2,JENNY>It seems some of the parents have some...concerns.

837
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:10,830
<25-3,RYAN>他们理解不了我的想法
<25-3,RYAN>Ah, yeah. Um, they're, uh, struggling with my vision.

838
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:12,300
<25-3,RYAN>我明天早上给艾洛蒂打电话
<25-3,RYAN>I'll -- I'll call éLodie in the morning.

839
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,490
<25-3,RYAN>带她过一遍
<25-3,RYAN>I'll walk her through it.

840
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:16,610
<25-4,JENNY>其实  他们已经决定改变思路了
<25-4,JENNY>Actually, they have decided to go a different direction.

841
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,710
<25-5,RYAN>等等  他们是把我炒了吗
<25-5,RYAN>Wait, they're firing me?

842
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:20,980
<25-5,RYAN>明天就要演出了
<25-5,RYAN>The play's tomorrow.

843
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:22,940
<25-5,RYAN>这是艾洛蒂的主意  对吧
<25-5,RYAN>It's that éLodie, isn't it?

844
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,760
<25-5,RYAN>那个魔鬼妈妈管家教协会的事还不够  非要
<25-5,RYAN>PTA's not enough for that mom-ster. She has to --

845
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,860
<25-6,JENNY>凯文  这是所有家长的意思
<25-6,JENNY>Kevin, it's all the parents.

846
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:29,990
<25-8,JENNY>大家都喜欢你的热情
<25-8,JENNY>Everybody loves your enthusiasm.

847
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,530
<25-8,JENNY>只是  孩子们还在上幼儿园
<25-8,JENNY>It's just, they're preschoolers.

848
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:34,070
<25-8,JENNY>他们不是百老汇明星
<25-8,JENNY>They're not Broadway stars.

849
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:35,030
<25-9,RYAN>所以不穿软底鞋了
<25-9,RYAN>So no soft-shoe?

850
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,360
<25-10,JENNY>不穿软底鞋了
<25-10,JENNY>No. No soft-shoe.

851
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:39,120
<25-11,RYAN>-好吧  -过来
<25-11,RYAN>- Okay. - Come here.

852
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,200
<25-12,JENNY>-这种事情时有发生  -是啊
<25-12,JENNY>- It happens. - Yeah.

853
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:45,820
<26-1,BECKETT>这么说  除了惹毛了一个爱杀人的毒枭大佬之外
<26-1,BECKETT>So, other than pissing off a homicidal drug lord,

854
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:48,410
<26-1,BECKETT>你觉得我们的惊喜约会夜怎么样
<26-1,BECKETT>how did you enjoy our surprise date night?

855
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,540
<26-2,CASTLE>你是说让一个
<26-2,CASTLE>Are you saying you planned

856
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:52,210
<26-2,CASTLE>在逃的毒枭绑架我是你安排的
<26-2,CASTLE>my abduction by a fugitive cartel leader?

857
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:55,760
<26-3,BECKETT>是的  还有我们英勇解救你这一切都是
<26-3,BECKETT>Yeah, complete with the daring rescue and everything.

858
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,670
<26-3,BECKETT>很有意思  对吧
<26-3,BECKETT>It was fun, huh?

859
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:57,840
<26-4,CASTLE>我觉得和瓜达拉哈拉来的屠夫
<26-4,CASTLE>I don't think date night counts

860
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,170
<26-4,CASTLE>共进烛光晚宴不算约会之夜吧
<26-4,CASTLE>when it's a candlelit dinner with the butcher of Guadalajara.

861
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:01,930
<26-5,BECKETT>我还准备了别的
<26-5,BECKETT>Well, I'll -- I'll plan something else.

862
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:03,840
<26-5,BECKETT>别的
<26-5,BECKETT>Something else?

863
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:06,980
<26-6,CASTLE>你根本没准备
<26-6,CASTLE>You didn't have a plan!

864
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:11,900
<26-7,BECKETT>你发现我们这样压力多大吗
<26-7,BECKETT>Do you realize how pressure-filled this is,

865
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,640
<26-7,BECKETT>总想打败对方
<26-7,BECKETT>always trying to top each other?

866
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,900
<26-8,CASTLE>这是我们乐趣源泉的一半
<26-8,CASTLE>That's half the fun of it.

867
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:18,150
<26-8,CASTLE>我们的竞争燃起热情之火
<26-8,CASTLE>Our rivalry is what fuels the passionate fire...

868
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:19,820
<26-10,CASTLE>-竞争  -你说什么
<26-10,CASTLE>- Rivalry. - What?

869
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:20,900
<26-11,BECKETT>竞争
<26-11,BECKETT>Rivalry.

870
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:23,170
<26-10,CASTLE>兄弟之间的竞争
<26-10,CASTLE>Between two brothers.

871
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,950
<26-11,BECKETT>什么  什么竞争
<26-11,BECKETT>What? What rivalry?

872
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:27,500
<26-12,CASTLE>豪尔赫·扎马克纳也就是枭熊
<26-12,CASTLE>The one between Jorge "El Oso" Zamacona

873
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,760
<26-12,CASTLE>和他弟弟海克托之间的竞争
<26-12,CASTLE>and his brother, Hector.

874
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:29,900
<26-13,BECKETT>竞争关系可以解释
<26-13,BECKETT>A rivalry would explain

875
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,540
<26-13,BECKETT>为什么赞恩会同时和兄弟俩合作
<26-13,BECKETT>why Zane was working with both brothers,

876
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,920
<26-13,BECKETT>但是我们怎么证明呢
<26-13,BECKETT>but how -- how do we prove it?

877
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,430
<26-14,CASTLE>我只要找到一个证据
<26-14,CASTLE>I just need to find one piece of evidence

878
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:38,040
<26-14,CASTLE>证明我的思路正确
<26-14,CASTLE>to see that I'm on the right track.

879
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,250
<26-14,CASTLE>这就行了
<26-14,CASTLE>And that could be it.

880
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:43,670
<27-1,CASTLE>我的西班牙语有点生疏了
<27-1,CASTLE>All right, my Spanish is a little rusty,

881
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:45,410
<27-1,CASTLE>但我的翻译软件显示
<27-1,CASTLE>but my handy translator says...

882
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:47,520
<27-2,ESPOSITO>海克托·扎马克纳一直和他兄弟的老婆睡觉
<27-2,ESPOSITO>Hector Zamacona's been sleeping with his brother's wife.

883
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,180
<27-3,CASTLE>自从枭熊逃亡开始
<27-3,CASTLE>They have been shacking up

884
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,670
<27-3,CASTLE>他们就一直在鬼混
<27-3,CASTLE>ever since El Oso went on the run.

885
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:52,170
<27-4,BECKETT>所以赞恩可能夹在
<27-4,BECKETT>So Zane might have been caught

886
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:53,920
<27-4,BECKETT>两兄弟的竞争之间
<27-4,BECKETT>in a rivalry between the brothers,

887
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,710
<27-4,BECKETT>因此导致了他的被杀
<27-4,BECKETT>and that's what got him killed.

888
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:57,570
<27-5,RYAN>海克托想要的不仅是枭熊的老婆
<27-5,RYAN>Hector wants more than just El Oso's wife.

889
00:33:57,570 --> 00:33:58,650
<27-5,RYAN>根据缉毒局的说法
<27-5,RYAN>According to the D.E.A.,

890
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:00,680
<27-5,RYAN>他所有的  呃  合法生意
<27-5,RYAN>all of his, uh, "Legitimate" Businesses --

891
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,460
<27-5,RYAN>都被怀疑是为了掩盖洗钱
<27-5,RYAN>They're suspected fronts for money laundering.

892
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,680
<27-6,ESPOSITO>所以  既然大哥在逃亡
<27-6,ESPOSITO>So with big brother on the run,

893
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:04,530
<27-6,ESPOSITO>豪尔赫·扎马克纳
<27-6,ESPOSITO>枭熊

894
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:07,580
<27-6,ESPOSITO>海克托可以争取由自己来管理家族
<27-6,ESPOSITO>Hector can make a play to rule the family in his place.

895
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:10,010
<27-7,CASTLE>但是海克托无法真正得到实权
<27-7,CASTLE>But Hector can never truly own the throne

896
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:12,430
<27-7,CASTLE>除非他的哥哥死了
<27-7,CASTLE>until his brother is dead.

897
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:15,360
<27-7,CASTLE>一个有权势的家族  一个贩毒帝国
<27-7,CASTLE>A powerful family, a cartel for a kingdom,

898
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,400
<27-7,CASTLE>两兄弟困在一场控制权的争斗中
<27-7,CASTLE>two brothers locked in a battle for control.

899
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,950
<27-7,CASTLE>伙计们  这就像这出戏一样
<27-7,CASTLE>Guys, this is just like the play.

900
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:23,100
<27-7,CASTLE>哈姆雷特的父亲被他兄弟所杀
<27-7,CASTLE>Hamlet's father is killed by his brother,

901
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,170
<27-7,CASTLE>而他兄弟夺取了王位
<27-7,CASTLE>who then takes the throne

902
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:26,260
<27-7,CASTLE>娶了他亡兄的妻子
<27-7,CASTLE>and marries the dead brother's wife.

903
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:28,260
<27-7,CASTLE>有人说莎士比亚是永恒的经典是有原因的
<27-7,CASTLE>There's a reason - they say Shakespeare endures.

904
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,670
<27-7,CASTLE>这就是一处现实版的哈姆雷特
<27-7,CASTLE>This is a real-life "Hamlet."

905
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:31,720
<27-8,BECKETT>好  除去主题的相似性不说
<27-8,BECKETT>Okay, so, thematic similarities aside,

906
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:35,610
<27-8,BECKETT>为什么海克托需要赞恩来除掉枭熊
<27-8,BECKETT>why would Hector need Zane to take down El Oso?

909
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:37,280
<27-9,CASTLE>因为海克托不知道去哪找他的哥哥
<27-9,CASTLE>Because Hector didn't know where to find his brother.

910
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,590
<27-10,RYAN>而电影明星赞恩面对面见过枭熊
<27-10,RYAN>And movie star Zane had a face-to-face with El Oso.

911
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:42,410
<27-11,CASTLE>这让赞恩成为了完美的特洛伊木马
<27-11,CASTLE>Making Zane the perfect Trojan Horse

912
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:44,000
<27-11,CASTLE>来引导海克托找到他哥哥
<27-11,CASTLE>to lead Hector to his brother.

913
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,170
<27-12,ESPOSITO>为什么赞恩会同意做这件事
<27-12,ESPOSITO>Why would Zane agree to do that?

914
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:47,530
<27-12,ESPOSITO>他想要出演枭熊的电影
<27-12,ESPOSITO>He wanted to star in the El Oso movie.

915
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:49,810
<27-13,BECKETT>钱
<27-13,BECKETT>Money.

916
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:51,800
<27-13,BECKETT>海克托值几亿美元
<27-13,BECKETT>Hector's worth hundreds of millions.

917
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,570
<27-13,BECKETT>赞恩现在就需要钱  不能等到三年后
<27-13,BECKETT>Zane needed the money now, not in three years,

918
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:56,500
<27-13,BECKETT>电影可以挣钱的时候
<27-13,BECKETT>when the movie could get off the ground.

919
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:59,150
<27-14,ESPOSITO>所以海克托提出来以解决赞恩钱的问题
<27-14,ESPOSITO>So Hector offers to solve Zane's money problems

920
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:02,090
<27-14,ESPOSITO>来交换赞恩带他找到枭熊
<27-14,ESPOSITO>in exchange for Zane leading him to El Oso.

921
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:04,010
<27-15,CASTLE>但枭熊拒绝与赞恩见面
<27-15,CASTLE>But El Oso refuses to meet with Zane.

922
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:07,130
<27-16,BECKETT>然后  与其等着看赞恩出演哈姆雷特的影评
<27-16,BECKETT>Then, rather than wait to see if Zane's "Hamlet" Reviews

923
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:08,570
<27-16,BECKETT>是否好到可以与枭熊见面
<27-16,BECKETT>are good enough to meet with El Oso,

924
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:11,010
<27-16,BECKETT>海克托决定掩盖踪迹
<27-16,BECKETT>Hector decides to cut his losses.

925
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:13,960
<27-17,CASTLE>在这个家族里  这就意味着杀人
<27-17,CASTLE>Which, in this family, translates to murder.

926
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:19,030
<28-1,HECTOR>我哥哥沾血的手给我们的家族带来了耻辱
<28-1,HECTOR>My brother's bloody hand has brought shame on our family.

927
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:20,860
<28-1,HECTOR>我们更愿意把他关起来
<28-1,HECTOR>We're better off with him back in a cage.

928
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,670
<28-2,BECKETT>是啊  我的意思是  你肯定更愿意这样
<28-2,BECKETT>Well, yeah, I mean, - you're definitely better off.

929
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:26,160
<28-2,BECKETT>你甚至都不用来偿还赞恩·卡侬的税债
<28-2,BECKETT>You didn't even have to pay for Zane Cannon's tax debts.

930
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,410
<28-3,HECTOR>我为什么要替一个电影明星交税
<28-3,HECTOR>Why would I pay a movie star's taxes?

931
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:30,320
<28-4,CASTLE>来让他带你找到你哥哥
<28-4,CASTLE>To get him to lead you to your brother.

932
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:31,980
<28-4,CASTLE>这样你就能杀了枭熊
<28-4,CASTLE>That way you could kill El Oso

933
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:34,060
<28-4,CASTLE>接管家族生意了
<28-4,CASTLE>and take over the family business,

934
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:37,320
<28-4,CASTLE>就像你接管了那你哥哥的老婆一样
<28-4,CASTLE>much in the same way you took over the family bed.

935
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,850
<28-5,BECKETT>而当赞恩不能再一次与枭熊见面后
<28-5,BECKETT>And when Zane couldn't get a second meeting with El Oso,

936
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:41,760
<28-5,BECKETT>他成了你的后患  所以你杀了他
<28-5,BECKETT>he was a loose end, so you killed him.

937
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,370
<28-6,HECTOR>我没有杀赞恩
<28-6,HECTOR>I did not kill Zane.

938
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:45,330
<28-7,BECKETT>我们知道赞恩用一个一次性手机给你打了电话
<28-7,BECKETT>We know that Zane called you from a burner phone

939
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:46,520
<28-7,BECKETT>就在他被杀几小时前
<28-7,BECKETT>hours before he was killed.

940
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,640
<28-7,BECKETT>我们也知道你把1500万美元
<28-7,BECKETT>We also know that you put $15 million

941
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:49,730
<28-7,BECKETT>放进了一个企业财产账户
<28-7,BECKETT>into a holding account.

942
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,980
<28-8,CASTLE>跟他税务账单的数额相同
<28-8,CASTLE>The exact amount of his tax bill.

943
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:54,210
<28-9,HECTOR>假设我确实跟他有协议
<28-9,HECTOR>Let's say I did have a deal with him.

944
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:57,210
<28-9,HECTOR>我为什么要在哈姆雷特试映一周前杀他呢
<28-9,HECTOR>Why would I kill him a week before "Hamlet" Previews?

945
00:35:57,210 --> 00:35:58,950
<28-9,HECTOR>按你所说  好的影评可以让他
<28-9,HECTOR>According to you, good reviews would have gotten him

946
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:00,750
<28-9,HECTOR>跟我哥哥再次见面
<28-9,HECTOR>another meeting with my brother.

947
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,740
<28-10,BECKETT>但那就会让赞恩难以得到
<28-10,BECKETT>But that would have put Zane out in the cold

948
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:04,240
<28-10,BECKETT>那个可能让他赢得奥斯卡的角色
<28-10,BECKETT>for his Oscar-winning role.

949
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,940
<28-10,BECKETT>所以即使有一大笔报酬
<28-10,BECKETT>And even with a big payoff, it would have been tough

950
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:07,940
<28-10,BECKETT>让他放弃那个角色仍然可能很困难
<28-10,BECKETT>to get him to walk away from that role.

951
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:11,860
<28-11,CASTLE>除非你承诺他无论如何他都可以保留那个角色
<28-11,CASTLE>Unless you promised him he could keep it anyway.

952
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,000
<28-11,CASTLE>当你哥哥死了
<28-11,CASTLE>With your brother dead,

953
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,750
<28-11,CASTLE>他的生命权就会转交给你
<28-11,CASTLE>the life rights would revert to you.

954
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:17,430
<28-12,HECTOR>我一点都不在乎枭熊的传记片
<28-12,HECTOR>I could care less about the El Oso biopic.

955
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:19,810
<28-12,HECTOR>我告诉他  他就算当导演我也不在乎
<28-12,HECTOR>I told him he could direct it for all I cared.

956
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:22,660
<28-13,CASTLE>等等  你告诉赞恩
<28-13,CASTLE>Wait, you -- you told Zane

957
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:25,380
<28-13,CASTLE>他能自导自演他的梦想中的项目
<28-13,CASTLE>he could star in and direct his dream project?

958
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,700
<28-14,HECTOR>只是我猜赞恩已经把这个工作
<28-14,HECTOR>Only I guess Zane had already promised the job

959
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,870
<28-14,HECTOR>承诺给了其他人
<28-14,HECTOR>to someone else --

960
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:31,590
<28-14,HECTOR>一个不是很愿意失去它的人
<28-14,HECTOR>someone who would not be happy to lose it.

961
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:37,580
<29-1,OPHELIA>它们令我痛心
<29-1,OPHELIA>O, woe is me.

962
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:40,270
<29-1,OPHELIA>与我现在所见到的
<29-1,OPHELIA>T'have seen what I have seen --

963
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:42,860
<29-2,ERIN>不  你必须更投入
<29-2,ERIN>No. Y-You've got to feel it more.

964
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:46,050
<29-2,ERIN>这不是随便一个和你在社交软件上分手的人
<29-2,ERIN>This isn't just some guy who broke up with you on Snapchat.

965
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:48,630
<29-2,ERIN>哈姆雷特背叛了你
<29-2,ERIN>Hamlet betrayed you.

966
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:49,980
<29-2,ERIN>他从来没有爱过你
<29-2,ERIN>He -- He never loved you.

967
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,590
<29-2,ERIN>你去进尼姑庵罢  对吗
<29-2,ERIN>"Get thee to a nunnery," Right?

968
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:53,960
<29-2,ERIN>哈姆雷特夺走了你的一切
<29-2,ERIN>Hamlet took everything from you.

969
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,810
<29-3,CASTLE>你肯定对这一幕感同身受
<29-3,CASTLE>That's certainly a scene you can relate to,

970
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:57,150
<29-3,CASTLE>不是吗  切尔洛夫女士
<29-3,CASTLE>isn't it, Ms. Cherloff?

971
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:58,830
<29-4,ERIN>这是非公开彩排
<29-4,ERIN>Uh, this is a private rehearsal.

972
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:01,350
<29-4,ERIN>我们20分钟后会休息  你能让我们先完成吗
<29-4,ERIN>We have a break in 20. Can you let us finish?

973
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:03,130
<29-5,RYAN>我觉得你可能已经完事了
<29-5,RYAN>I think maybe you are finished.

974
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:04,460
<29-6,CASTLE>虽然我们很尊敬莎翁
<29-6,CASTLE>All due respect to the Bard,

975
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:06,270
<29-6,CASTLE>不过我们带来了一个我们自己的故事
<29-6,CASTLE>we're here with a tale of our own --

976
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:09,580
<29-6,CASTLE>一个带有背叛和嫉妒  经典的悲剧
<29-6,CASTLE>one with betrayal and jealousy, though sadly classic.

977
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,690
<29-7,ESPOSITO>一个真正有天赋的导演看着
<29-7,ESPOSITO>A truly gifted director watches

978
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:15,140
<29-7,ESPOSITO>她以前的同学成为好莱坞升起的新星
<29-7,ESPOSITO>as her former classmate's star rises in Hollywood,

979
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:18,340
<29-7,ESPOSITO>而她还在为每个机会拼命争取
<29-7,ESPOSITO>while she fought like hell for every opportunity.

980
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:20,060
<29-8,ERIN>我热爱我的工作
<29-8,ERIN>I love what I do.

981
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:22,430
<29-8,ERIN>所以如果赞恩选择了健身馆而不是演艺学校
<29-8,ERIN>So what if Zane made millions

982
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,390
<29-8,ERIN>而挣了几百万美元又怎么样呢
<29-8,ERIN>because he chose the gym over acting school?

983
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:26,370
<29-8,ERIN>我创造了艺术
<29-8,ERIN>I make art.

984
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:29,600
<29-9,CASTLE>但当赞恩向你要求选他来演哈姆雷特
<29-9,CASTLE>But when Zane asked you to cast him as Hamlet,

985
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:30,790
<29-9,CASTLE>你拒绝了他  不是吗
<29-9,CASTLE>you told him no, didn't you?

986
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:32,860
<29-10,ERIN>是的  直到他让我相信他适合这个角色
<29-10,ERIN>Yes, until he convinced me he was right for the part.

987
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:36,650
<29-11,RYAN>用让你导演枭熊传记片这个千载难逢的机会吗
<29-11,RYAN>By offering you your big break directing the El Oso biopic?

988
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:39,060
<29-12,CASTLE>但那只是个空头支票
<29-12,CASTLE>But it was a Hollywood promise.

989
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:40,180
<29-12,CASTLE>一文不值
<29-12,CASTLE>Not worth a damn.

990
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:41,800
<29-12,CASTLE>告诉我  他是向你坦白
<29-12,CASTLE>Tell me, did he confess to you

991
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,530
<29-12,CASTLE>他会亲自执导
<29-12,CASTLE>that he would be directing the picture on his own,

992
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:46,180
<29-12,CASTLE>还是只是告诉你你丢掉了这份工作
<29-12,CASTLE>or did he just tell you you lost the job?

993
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:47,990
<29-13,ERIN>都不是
<29-13,ERIN>Neither.

994
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:50,290
<29-13,ERIN>因为这些都没有发生过
<29-13,ERIN>Because it didn't happen.

995
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:53,810
<29-13,ERIN>我根本不知道什么枭熊项目
<29-13,ERIN>I-I don't know anything about an El Oso project.

996
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:56,790
<29-14,ESPOSITO>那么你如何解释你笔记本电脑上的搜索历史
<29-14,ESPOSITO>Then how do you explain the browser history on your laptop?

997
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:00,240
<29-15,RYAN>还有你壁橱里沾着赞恩的血的鞋子
<29-15,RYAN>Or the shoes in your closet with Zane's blood on them?

998
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:09,110
<29-16,ERIN>你们根本不知道让赞恩出演这剧
<29-16,ERIN>You have no idea what a risk it was

999
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:10,700
<29-16,ERIN>风险有多高
<29-16,ERIN>putting Zane in this play.

1000
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,980
<29-16,ERIN>唯一值得的回报就是
<29-16,ERIN>A-And the only thing that made it worthwhile

1001
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:14,240
<29-16,ERIN>导演那部电影
<29-16,ERIN>was directing that movie.

1002
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:17,470
<29-16,ERIN>结果他告诉我  他要执导
<29-16,ERIN>A-And then he tells me that -- that he's gonna do it

1003
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:19,720
<29-16,ERIN>而我可能只是创造了
<29-16,ERIN>a-and I'm left with maybe the worst production

1004
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:20,910
<29-16,ERIN>史上最差劲《哈姆雷特》
<29-16,ERIN>of "Hamlet" in history.

1005
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:23,360
<29-16,ERIN>我的职业生涯基本断送了
<29-16,ERIN>I mean, my career is as good as over.

1006
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:26,830
<29-16,ERIN>你们知道作为一个女人进军导演界
<29-16,ERIN>Do you have any idea how difficult it is as a woman

1007
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:28,580
<29-16,ERIN>有多么艰难吗
<29-16,ERIN>to break into directing film?

1008
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:31,820
<29-16,ERIN>而他就这么轻描淡写地夺走了我的机会
<29-16,ERIN>A-And he took away my shot like it was nothing.

1009
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:35,650
<29-16,ERIN>那晚我听着他的声音
<29-16,ERIN>I heard him that night

1010
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:37,970
<29-16,ERIN>毁掉舞台剧上
<29-16,ERIN>torturing maybe the most beautiful words

1011
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:42,660
<29-16,ERIN>最美丽的台词  我发狂了
<29-16,ERIN>ever written for the stage, and I just snapped.

1012
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,520
<29-17,RYAN>这边走  切尔洛夫女士
<29-17,RYAN>This way, Ms. Cherloff.

1013
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:50,060
<29-18,OPHELIA>这是在说彩排结束了吗
<29-18,OPHELIA>Is that a wrap on rehearsal?

1014
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:51,050
<30-1,ESPOSITO>你还在因为被赶出莎拉·格雷斯的
<30-1,ESPOSITO>You still mad about being fired

1015
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:52,790
<30-1,ESPOSITO>学前表演生气吗
<30-1,ESPOSITO>off Sarah Grace's preschool play?

1016
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:56,040
<30-2,RYAN>只是在生自己的气  我发过誓不做那种爸爸的
<30-2,RYAN>Ah, only at myself. I swore I'd never be that dad.

1017
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,680
<30-3,ESPOSITO>什么  那种傻乎乎地
<30-3,ESPOSITO>What, the kind - that makes an ass of himself

1018
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,820
<30-3,ESPOSITO>为了自己女儿跳得像一朵花的吗
<30-3,ESPOSITO>by dancing around like a flower for his daughter?

1019
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:00,870
<30-4,RYAN>不  那种
<30-4,RYAN>No, the kind...

1020
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:03,050
<30-4,RYAN>那种只想着自己想要什么
<30-4,RYAN>the kind who gets caught up in what he wants,

1021
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:04,070
<30-4,RYAN>而不是他的孩子想要什么
<30-4,RYAN>not what his kid does.

1022
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:05,790
<30-5,JENNY>好了  我们走
<30-5,JENNY>Yeah, okay, let's go.

1023
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:07,630
<30-6,SARAH GRACE>爹地
<30-6,SARAH GRACE>Daddy!

1024
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:09,430
<30-7,RYAN>瞧瞧我的小向日葵
<30-7,RYAN>Look at my little sunflower!

1025
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:10,870
<30-8,SARAH GRACE>你好  哈维叔叔
<30-8,SARAH GRACE>Hey! Uncle Javi!

1026
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:12,500
<30-9,ESPOSITO>亲爱的
<30-9,ESPOSITO>Ohh! Hey, baby.

1027
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:13,380
<30-11,JENNY>我刚准备出发
<30-11,JENNY>Hey. I was just leaving.

1028
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:14,590
<30-12,RYAN>你们不是应该已经到那里了吗
<30-12,RYAN>Aren't you guys - already supposed to be there?

1029
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:16,100
<30-13,JENNY>她不想去
<30-13,JENNY>Uh, she didn't want to go.

1030
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:18,690
<30-13,JENNY>不肯说为什么  她只是想见你
<30-13,JENNY>Wouldn't say why. She just wants you.

1031
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,540
<30-14,RYAN>宝贝
<30-14,RYAN>Uh...hey, sweetie.

1032
00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:25,840
<30-14,RYAN>听着  如果你不想唱就不用唱
<30-14,RYAN>Look, y-you don't have to sing if you don't want to.

1033
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,990
<30-14,RYAN>这是原则
<30-14,RYAN>That's the law.

1034
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,530
<30-15,SARAH GRACE>但是如果我不唱你会不开心
<30-15,SARAH GRACE>But you'll be sad if I don't.

1035
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:31,260
<30-16,RYAN>什么  不会
<30-16,RYAN>What? No.

1036
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:33,210
<30-17,JENNY>我想更可能的是她忘记台词了
<30-17,JENNY>I think it's more she forgot the words.

1037
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:37,000
<30-18,RYAN>你想让我帮你回忆台词吗
<30-18,RYAN>Oh, do -- do you want me to help you remember the words?

1038
