10
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,310
<1-1,KATE BECKETT>卡塞尔
<1-1,KATE BECKETT>Castle.

11
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:41,090
<1-2,JAVIER ESPOSITO>别过去  你帮不了他
<1-2,JAVIER ESPOSITO>Stay back! There's nothing you can do!

12
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:56,420
<1-3,MARTHA RODGERS>天啊
<1-3,MARTHA RODGERS>Oh, my god!

15
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,080
<1-1,KATE BECKETT>卡塞尔
<1-1,KATE BECKETT>Castle.

19
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,610
<1-5,BECKETT>是空的
<1-5,BECKETT>It's empty.

20
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:58,810
<1-5,BECKETT>他不在
<1-5,BECKETT>He's not here.

21
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:00,860
<1-5,BECKETT>他不在车里
<1-5,BECKETT>He's not in the car!

22
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,270
<2-1,ESPOSITO>你确定
<2-1,ESPOSITO>You sure he's not in the car?

23
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,210
<2-2,BECKETT>即使烧到那个温度  也会留下遗骸
<2-2,BECKETT>Even with a fire that hot, there'd still be a body.

24
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:08,200
<2-2,BECKETT>他肯定在附近
<2-2,BECKETT>He's got to be nearby.

25
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,980
<2-3,MARTHA>-你真觉得...  -他还活着  肯定的
<2-3,MARTHA>- You really think he... - He's here. He has to be.

26
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:13,350
<2-4,BECKETT>-我们得赶快找  -我们需要人手
<2-4,BECKETT>- We have to start a search. - We could use more men.

27
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,240
<2-5,RYAN>警佐
<2-5,RYAN>Sergeant!

28
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,110
<2-6,BECKETT>我是贝克特探长  纽约警局
<2-6,BECKETT>I'm detective Beckett, NYPD.

29
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:19,440
<2-6,BECKETT>那辆车的驾驶员是我们自己人
<2-6,BECKETT>The man that was in that car is one of our own.

30
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,050
<2-6,BECKETT>-我们要彻底搜索这一带  -我立刻派人去
<2-6,BECKETT>- We need to scrub every inch of this area. - I'll get my men on it.

31
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,390
<2-8,RYAN>你们有搜救狗吗
<2-8,RYAN>You have search-and-rescue dogs?

32
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,630
<2-9,TAGGERT>-我去叫支援  -好
<2-9,TAGGERT>- I'll call them in. - Okay.

33
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:28,200
<2-11,BECKETT>我得去帮忙
<2-11,BECKETT>I need to help them.

34
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,900
<2-12,ESPOSITO>你穿成这样帮不上忙
<2-12,ESPOSITO>You're no use to anyone dressed like that.

35
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,370
<2-12,ESPOSITO>我们马上开始  你去换衣服
<2-12,ESPOSITO>We'll get started here. You go change.

36
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:33,710
<2-13,MARTHA>走吧  我们给你换件衣服
<2-13,MARTHA>Come on. Let's get you into some other clothes.

37
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,090
<2-14,BECKETT>好的  我就回来
<2-14,BECKETT>Okay, I'll be right back.

38
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,610
<2-15,RYAN>好了  我沿着路边找
<2-15,RYAN>All right. I'm gonna search up near the road.

39
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:39,480
<2-15,RYAN>或许卡塞尔在撞车之前跳车了
<2-15,RYAN>Maybe Castle managed to bail out before the car crashed.

40
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,350
<2-16,ESPOSITO>我去看看车
<2-16,ESPOSITO>All right, we'll start on the car,

41
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:42,690
<2-16,ESPOSITO>-看看能不能查明情况  或是他的去向  -好
<2-16,ESPOSITO>- see if we can tell - what happened or where he went. - All right.

42
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,350
<3-1,TAGGERT>气囊冲气了
<3-1,TAGGERT>Airbag went off.

43
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,190
<3-1,TAGGERT>只有座位上有人才会启动
<3-1,TAGGERT>It only activates - when someone's in that seat,

44
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:50,230
<3-1,TAGGERT>这么说他当时的确在车上
<3-1,TAGGERT>So your man - was definitely at the wheel.

45
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:51,030
<3-2,ESPOSITO>但他跑出来了
<3-2,ESPOSITO>Yeah, but if he walked away,

46
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,570
<3-2,ESPOSITO>他人呢  而且为什么不接电话
<3-2,ESPOSITO>where is he, - and why isn't he picking up?

47
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:53,980
<3-3,TAGGERT>或许手机摔坏了
<3-3,TAGGERT>Maybe his phone's damaged

48
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,320
<3-3,TAGGERT>或者撞迷糊了
<3-3,TAGGERT>or he's disoriented.

49
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,370
<3-3,TAGGERT>这情况我见识过
<3-3,TAGGERT>I've seen it before.

50
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,640
<3-3,TAGGERT>如果他下了车
<3-3,TAGGERT>But if he left this vehicle,

51
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,930
<3-3,TAGGERT>应该能查到足迹或血迹
<3-3,TAGGERT>there's gonna be tracks or a blood trail.

52
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,680
<3-5,RYAN>-喂  -哈维
<3-5,RYAN>- Hello. - Hey, Javi.

53
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,190
<3-5,RYAN>去看看卡塞尔车的后面
<3-5,RYAN>Walk to the back of Castle's car.

54
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:04,750
<3-7,RYAN>-干吗  -照做就是了
<3-7,RYAN>- What for? - Just do it, okay?

55
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:05,880
<3-7,RYAN>看看副驾后侧
<3-7,RYAN>Check the passenger rear side.

56
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,030
<3-7,RYAN>告诉我什么情况
<3-7,RYAN>Tell me what you see.

57
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,470
<3-8,ESPOSITO>看来右侧被撞过
<3-8,ESPOSITO>Looks like it took a hit on the right side,

58
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:13,290
<3-8,ESPOSITO>尾灯撞坏了
<3-8,ESPOSITO>Busted a taillight.

59
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:14,890
<3-9,RYAN>因为卡塞尔是被别的车撞了
<3-9,RYAN>That's 'cause Castle got bumped by another car

60
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:15,570
<3-9,RYAN>才冲下道路
<3-9,RYAN>and run off the road.

61
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,730
<3-9,RYAN>我在碎片这里
<3-9,RYAN>I got debris up here.

62
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:17,960
<3-10,ESPOSITO>好  叫鉴证组来
<3-10,ESPOSITO>All right, call local CSU.

63
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,130
<3-10,ESPOSITO>或许能通过碎片知道是什么车
<3-10,ESPOSITO>Maybe those pieces - can help us I.D. that car.

64
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,800
<3-11,TAGGERT>警探  我有发现
<3-11,TAGGERT>Detective, I think I got something.

65
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,690
<3-11,TAGGERT>足迹
<3-11,TAGGERT>Tracks.

66
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:29,780
<3-11,TAGGERT>从车上下来  往那边走了
<3-11,TAGGERT>Going from the car up to the road.

67
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,790
<3-11,TAGGERT>水冲掉了一些痕迹  但看来有三个人
<3-11,TAGGERT>Water washed part of the trail, but it looks like three people.

68
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:33,940
<3-12,ESPOSITO>三个人  不会啊
<3-12,ESPOSITO>Three people? That can't be right.

69
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,420
<3-13,TAGGERT>看到土里的两道痕迹了吗
<3-13,TAGGERT>See the two troughs in the dirt?

70
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:37,890
<3-13,TAGGERT>是一双鞋的鞋跟留下的
<3-13,TAGGERT>Made by heels from a pair of shoes.

71
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:41,160
<3-14,ESPOSITO>那么说他被赶下了路  然后又被从车上拖了下来
<3-14,ESPOSITO>So he was run off the road then dragged from the car.

72
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,900
<3-14,ESPOSITO>卡塞尔被人抓走了
<3-14,ESPOSITO>Castle got grabbed.

73
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:49,010
<4-2,RYAN>-什么情况  -我让泰吉特设了路障
<4-2,RYAN>- What? - I had Taggert set up roadblocks

74
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:50,860
<4-2,RYAN>拦截搜查每一辆车
<4-2,RYAN>to stop and search every vehicle.

75
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:53,060
<4-3,ESPOSITO>我们认为卡塞尔可能就在
<4-3,ESPOSITO>We figured that the car that ran Castle into the ditch

76
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,560
<4-3,ESPOSITO>把他撞下路的那辆车上
<4-3,ESPOSITO>may be the same car he's in now.

77
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,770
<4-4,BECKETT>-知道什么车了吗  -不知道  但鉴证组认为
<4-4,BECKETT>- Okay, we get a description? - Not yet, but CSU thinks

78
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:59,330
<4-5,ESPOSITO>那些碎片是一辆通用上面掉下来的
<4-5,ESPOSITO>the side-marker glass up ahead came from a GM.

79
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:00,490
<4-5,ESPOSITO>当地警方在进行排查
<4-5,ESPOSITO>Local P.D. is canvassing

80
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,380
<4-5,ESPOSITO>询问是否有人看到车辆离开这一带
<4-5,ESPOSITO>to see if anyone saw any vehicles leaving the area.

81
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,520
<4-7,ESPOSITO>-卡塞尔的手机呢  -营运商说他关机了
<4-7,ESPOSITO>- What about Castle's cellphone? - His provider says it's shut off.

82
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,880
<4-8,RYAN>我们联系了联调局看看能不能远程启动
<4-8,RYAN>Contacted the FBI to see if it could be turned on remotely.

83
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,130
<4-8,RYAN>希望不大  但也未必
<4-8,RYAN>It's a long shot, but you never know.

84
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:09,620
<4-9,BECKETT>-还有什么  -凯特
<4-9,BECKETT>- What else? - Kate...

85
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,230
<4-10,ESPOSITO>我们已经尽了一切全力
<4-10,ESPOSITO>Everything that can be done is being done.

86
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:12,820
<4-11,BECKETT>埃斯波  别说这种话
<4-11,BECKETT>Espo, don't tell me that.

87
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:15,690
<4-11,BECKETT>他们绑走了他  我必须做点什么
<4-11,BECKETT>They took him. I need to do something.

88
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:17,180
<4-12,ESPOSITO>那跟我们说说你接到的那通电话
<4-12,ESPOSITO>Then tell us about that phone call you got.

89
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,250
<4-13,RYAN>他当时紧张吗
<4-13,RYAN>Was he nervous?

90
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,470
<4-13,RYAN>他有暗示说他被跟踪了吗
<4-13,RYAN>Did he indicate in any way he was being followed?

91
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:22,780
<4-14,BECKETT>没有  他...
<4-14,BECKETT>No, he was just...

92
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:26,200
<4-14,BECKETT>很正常  一切都很正常
<4-14,BECKETT>...Normal. He was normal.

93
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,630
<4-15,ESPOSITO>泰吉特警佐可能找到了目击者
<4-15,ESPOSITO>Hey, sergeant Taggert may have a witness.

94
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,260
<4-15,ESPOSITO>在前面摆水果摊
<4-15,ESPOSITO>Guy runs a fruit stand up the road.

95
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,690
<5-1,CAL HARPER>是的  我在你们说的时间段
<5-1,CAL HARPER>Yeah, I definitely saw a mercedes go by

96
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,750
<5-1,CAL HARPER>看到一辆梅赛德斯驶过  青铜色
<5-1,CAL HARPER>around the time you're talking... bronze-colored.

97
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,640
<5-2,ESPOSITO>那是卡塞尔的车
<5-2,ESPOSITO>That's Castle's car.

98
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,530
<5-3,BECKETT>-那之后有其他的车吗  -我想想
<5-3,BECKETT>- What about any cars after that? - Uh, let's see.

99
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:43,690
<5-4,CAL>一辆大众甲壳虫  一辆法拉利  一辆SUV
<5-4,CAL>There was a volkswagen bug, a Ferrari, an SUV.

100
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:45,820
<5-5,ESPOSITO>不会有人开甲壳虫或者法拉利把他逼下路
<5-5,ESPOSITO>No one's gonna run him off the road with a bug or a Ferrari.

101
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,500
<5-6,BECKETT>跟我说说那辆SUV的情况
<5-6,BECKETT>Talk to me about that SUV.

102
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,520
<5-7,CAL>是一辆凯雷德
<5-7,CAL>It was an Escalade --

103
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,560
<5-7,CAL>黑色车  有色车窗和铬合金车轮
<5-7,CAL>Black with tinted windows and chrome wheels.

104
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,310
<5-8,ESPOSITO>你怎么碰巧记得这么清楚
<5-8,ESPOSITO>How is it you happen to remember it so clearly?

105
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,440
<5-9,CAL>因为我看见了两次
<5-9,CAL>Because I saw it twice.

106
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,380
<5-9,CAL>他往北开  路过一次
<5-9,CAL>He passed heading north.

107
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,920
<5-9,CAL>大约十分钟后  又飞驰而过
<5-9,CAL>Then he blew by again maybe 10 minutes later.

108
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:00,820
<5-10,BECKETT>他们拉着卡塞尔离开长岛一路朝南
<5-10,BECKETT>They were headed south off of Long Island with Castle.

109
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,220
<5-11,TAGGERT>我去对那辆凯雷德发布全境通告
<5-11,TAGGERT>I'll put out an APB on the Escalade.

110
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,830
<5-12,ESPOSITO>我去给州警察打电话  让他们
<5-12,ESPOSITO>I'm gonna call state police, have them set up checkpoints

111
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,350
<5-12,ESPOSITO>在离开长岛的每一条路上设立检查站
<5-12,ESPOSITO>at every road leading off of Long Island.

112
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:06,950
<5-13,RYAN>他们可能不是打算带卡塞尔离开长岛
<5-13,RYAN>Getting Castle off the island may not be the plan.

113
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:07,950
<5-13,RYAN>联调局刚打来了电话
<5-13,RYAN>The feds just called.

114
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,890
<5-13,RYAN>他们成功地远程激活了卡塞尔的电话
<5-13,RYAN>They were able to remotely activate Castle's phone

115
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:10,620
<5-13,RYAN>大概持续了几秒钟
<5-13,RYAN>for a few seconds.

116
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:11,560
<5-14,BECKETT>他们查到位置了吗
<5-14,BECKETT>Did they get a location?

117
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:13,040
<5-15,RYAN>是啊  他还在岛上
<5-15,RYAN>Yeah, he's still on the island.

118
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,070
<5-15,RYAN>根据他的卫星定位  十分钟前
<5-15,RYAN>According to his GPS, as of 10 minutes ago,

119
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:15,910
<5-15,RYAN>他在德福德
<5-15,RYAN>he was in Medford.

120
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:17,610
<5-16,BECKETT>德福德离这里有多远
<5-16,BECKETT>How far is Medford from here?

121
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,340
<5-17,TAGGERT>我一路疾驰过去  不会很远的
<5-17,TAGGERT>Not far the way I'm gonna drive.

122
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,230
<6-1,RYAN>卡塞尔的卫星定位
<6-1,RYAN>It says Castle's GPS

123
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:26,460
<6-1,RYAN>显示他在废车场往里一百英尺的地方
<6-1,RYAN>puts him at a hundred feet into this junkyard.

124
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,440
<6-2,TAGGERT>州警察十分钟后就到了
<6-2,TAGGERT>State police are 10 minutes out.

125
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,860
<6-2,TAGGERT>他们想让你们等待支援
<6-2,TAGGERT>They want you to wait for backup.

126
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,220
<6-3,BECKETT>绝不可能
<6-3,BECKETT>Not a chance in hell.

127
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,350
<6-4,RYAN>就在那边
<6-4,RYAN>It's right over there.

128
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,460
<6-4,RYAN>85英尺  正在靠近
<6-4,RYAN>85 feet and closing.

129
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:39,260
<6-5,ESPOSITO>哪边
<6-5,ESPOSITO>Which way?

130
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,930
<6-6,RYAN>我想是这辆汽车运输车的另一边
<6-6,RYAN>Other side of this car carrier, I think.

131
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,580
<6-6,RYAN>现在距离60英尺
<6-6,RYAN>60 feet now.

132
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:46,350
<6-7,BECKETT>那里
<6-7,BECKETT>There.

133
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,220
<6-7,BECKETT>黑色的凯雷德
<6-7,BECKETT>Black Escalade.

134
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:47,920
<6-7,BECKETT>是啊
<6-7,BECKETT>Yeah.

135
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,470
<6-8,RYAN>那是卡塞尔卫星定位的位置
<6-8,RYAN>That's ground zero for Castle's GPS.

136
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:50,440
<6-9,ESPOSITO>所以他在车里
<6-9,ESPOSITO>So he's in there.

137
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,030
<6-10,BECKETT>不
<6-10,BECKETT>No.

138
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,790
<6-10,BECKETT>站住
<6-10,BECKETT>Stop!

139
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,150
<6-11,BECKETT>不要动
<6-11,BECKETT>Do not move!

140
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:05,560
<6-12,BECKETT>站住
<6-12,BECKETT>Stop!

141
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:26,720
<6-13,RYAN>-趴下  不许动  -站住
<6-13,RYAN>- On the ground! Don't move! - Freeze!

142
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:27,810
<6-14,ESPOSITO>马上趴下
<6-14,ESPOSITO>On the ground now!

143
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,270
<6-15,BECKETT>你做了什么
<6-15,BECKETT>What have you done?!

144
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,580
<6-16,RYAN>-你做了什么  -贝克特  我们抓到他了
<6-16,RYAN>- What have you done?! - Beckett! We got him! We got him!

145
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,160
<6-17,ESPOSITO>-不  -贝克特  住手
<6-17,ESPOSITO>- No! - Beckett, stop!

146
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,470
<6-17,ESPOSITO>不  不
<6-17,ESPOSITO>No! No!

156
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,400
<6-17,ESPOSITO>加里·达芬
<6-17,ESPOSITO>Gary Duffin.

157
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,070
<7-1,BECKETT>你对审讯室很熟悉
<7-1,BECKETT>You're no stranger to rooms like this.

158
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,100
<7-1,BECKETT>但这次不一样了
<7-1,BECKETT>But this time it's different.

159
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,790
<7-1,BECKETT>这次你唯一的选择就是给我答案
<7-1,BECKETT>This time, your only option is to give me answers.

160
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,500
<7-2,GARY DUFFIN>如果我不给呢
<7-2,GARY DUFFIN>And what if I don't?

161
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:09,310
<7-3,BECKETT>那辆SUV开进去时  你在废车场
<7-3,BECKETT>You were in the junkyard when that SUV came in.

162
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,230
<7-3,BECKETT>谁在车里
<7-3,BECKETT>Who was in it?

163
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,130
<7-4,GARY>知道吗
<7-4,GARY>You know what?

164
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,670
<7-4,GARY>我要律师
<7-4,GARY>I want a lawyer.

165
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,190
<7-5,BECKETT>你是个低等的人渣  加里
<7-5,BECKETT>You're a low-level dirtbag, Gary.

166
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:21,710
<7-5,BECKETT>你可不是犯罪首脑  所以快点交代
<7-5,BECKETT>You're not a criminal mastermind, so start talking.

167
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:23,900
<7-5,BECKETT>车里有谁
<7-5,BECKETT>Who was in the car?

168
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,540
<7-5,BECKETT>是谁让你粉碎汽车的
<7-5,BECKETT>Who had you crush it?

169
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:29,020
<7-6,BECKETT>卡塞尔在车里吗
<7-6,BECKETT>Was Castle in the car?

170
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,400
<7-6,BECKETT>他在车里吗
<7-6,BECKETT>Was he in the car?

171
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,150
<7-6,BECKETT>他还活着吗
<7-6,BECKETT>Was he alive?

172
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,450
<7-7,GARY>你要折断我的手指了
<7-7,GARY>Aah! You're gonna break my finger!

173
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:35,790
<7-8,BECKETT>折断一根还有九根
<7-8,BECKETT>And then after that, there's nine more,

174
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:38,340
<7-8,BECKETT>快告诉我我想知道的
<7-8,BECKETT>so tell me what I want to know.

175
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,280
<7-8,BECKETT>快交代的
<7-8,BECKETT>Start talking.

176
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:43,410
<7-9,GARY>我没什么好说的
<7-9,GARY>I got nothing to say.

177
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:50,710
<8-1,BECKETT>怎么了
<8-1,BECKETT>What? What is it?

178
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,880
<8-2,ESPOSITO>法医对SUV的检查结果出来了
<8-2,ESPOSITO>Forensics came back on the SUV.

179
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,320
<8-2,ESPOSITO>没有血液或者组织
<8-2,ESPOSITO>There was no blood or tissue.

180
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,600
<8-2,ESPOSITO>卡塞尔不在车里
<8-2,ESPOSITO>Castle wasn't inside.

181
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:01,310
<8-2,ESPOSITO>好吧
<8-2,ESPOSITO>Okay.

182
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,460
<8-3,BECKETT>那他还活着
<8-3,BECKETT>So he's still out there.

183
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:09,440
<8-4,BECKETT>这就说明他们粉碎那辆车来掩盖行踪
<8-4,BECKETT>Which means they crushed the car to cover their tracks.

184
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,110
<8-4,BECKETT>让鉴证组寻找DNA和指纹
<8-4,BECKETT>Okay, get CSU to sweep for dna and prints.

185
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,750
<8-4,BECKETT>把加里·达芬送去拘留室
<8-4,BECKETT>And let's move Gary Duffin to a holding cell.

186
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:16,390
<8-5,ESPOSITO>好让你对他干什么
<8-5,ESPOSITO>So you can do what to him?

187
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:18,680
<8-5,ESPOSITO>我之前在看
<8-5,ESPOSITO>I was watching.

188
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:21,340
<8-5,ESPOSITO>动粗是无济于事的
<8-5,ESPOSITO>Getting booted off the force is not gonna help anything.

189
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,380
<8-6,BECKETT>埃斯波  他知道是谁绑架了卡塞尔
<8-6,BECKETT>Espo, he knows who took Castle.

190
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,050
<8-7,ESPOSITO>他不会供出那些人的
<8-7,ESPOSITO>Well, he's never gonna give them up.

191
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,880
<8-7,ESPOSITO>不管那些人是谁  比起你来
<8-7,ESPOSITO>Whoever they are, he's way more afraid of them

192
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,000
<8-7,ESPOSITO>他更害怕他们
<8-7,ESPOSITO>than he is of you.

193
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:33,420
<8-8,BECKETT>好吧  我们会采取另一种方式
<8-8,BECKETT>Fine. We'll try another angle...

194
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:34,380
<8-8,BECKETT>暂时如此
<8-8,BECKETT>For now.

195
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:35,940
<8-8,BECKETT>谢谢
<8-8,BECKETT>Thanks.

196
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,860
<9-1,RYAN>SUV这条线索断了
<9-1,RYAN>So, we are dead-ended on the SUV.

197
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:40,630
<9-1,RYAN>查了车牌号
<9-1,RYAN>Ran the vin number.

198
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:42,210
<9-1,RYAN>原来这辆车是从
<9-1,RYAN>Turns out that it was stolen

199
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:43,970
<9-1,RYAN>肯尼迪机场附近的一处长期停车场被盗的
<9-1,RYAN>from a long-term parking lot near JFK

200
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:46,660
<9-1,RYAN>而那里的视频监控很糟糕
<9-1,RYAN>with conveniently lousy video surveillance.

201
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:49,810
<9-2,BECKETT>好吧  再深入查查碎车的这个加里·达芬
<9-2,BECKETT>okay, let's dig deeper into our car-crusher, Gary Duffin...

202
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:52,900
<9-2,BECKETT>查查他的背景  他的联系人
<9-2,BECKETT>Look into his background, his known associates.

203
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,710
<9-2,BECKETT>也许能让我们找到绑架卡塞尔的人
<9-2,BECKETT>That might lead us to whoever took Castle.

204
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,490
<9-3,ESPOSITO>马上去
<9-3,ESPOSITO>We're on it.

205
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:57,860
<9-4,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>警探  能聊聊吗
<9-4,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>Detective. Do you have a moment?

206
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:59,150
<9-5,BECKETT>好的  长官
<9-5,BECKETT>Yes, sir.

207
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:01,690
<9-6,GATES>你还好吗
<9-6,GATES>How are you holding up?

208
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:03,600
<9-7,BECKETT>我没事
<9-7,BECKETT>I'm fine.

209
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,560
<9-8,GATES>我无法想象你的感受
<9-8,GATES>I truly can't imagine what you're going through,

210
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:08,630
<9-8,GATES>这种时候你怎么能集中精力
<9-8,GATES>how you can focus at a time like this.

211
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:11,800
<9-9,BECKETT>长官  请别把我撤出这案子
<9-9,BECKETT>Uh, sir, please don't take me off of this case.

212
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,190
<9-10,GATES>我不会  除非你让我非这么做不可
<9-10,GATES>Oh, I won't...unless you give me cause to.

213
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:16,070
<9-10,GATES>你继续做你的事
<9-10,GATES>You keep doing what you're doing.

214
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,800
<9-11,BECKETT>好的  谢谢
<9-11,BECKETT>Okay. Thank you.

215
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,090
<9-12,GATES>另外  希望你知道
<9-12,GATES>And you should know we're using

216
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:21,440
<9-12,GATES>我们正在动用一切资源去寻找卡塞尔先生
<9-12,GATES>every resource that we have to find Mr. Castle,

217
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:23,200
<9-12,GATES>包括向联调局求助
<9-12,GATES>including calling in the FBI.

218
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:25,670
<9-12,GATES>有位叫康纳的特别探员在等你
<9-12,GATES>There's a special agent Connors waiting to speak with you.

219
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:28,120
<9-13,BECKETT>长官  恕我直言  我现在压力很大
<9-13,BECKETT>Sir, with all due respect, I-I'm under the gun here.

220
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,720
<9-13,BECKETT>没时间协助联调局了解情况
<9-13,BECKETT>I don't have time to bring the FBI up to speed.

221
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,800
<9-14,SPECIAL AGENT CONNORS>情况我已经了解了  探长
<9-14,SPECIAL AGENT CONNORS>I'm already up to speed, detective.

222
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:34,900
<9-14,SPECIAL AGENT CONNORS>我只有几个问题
<9-14,SPECIAL AGENT CONNORS>I just have a few questions.

223
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,890
<9-14,SPECIAL AGENT CONNORS>凯特
<9-14,SPECIAL AGENT CONNORS>Kate.

224
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,480
<9-15,GATES>他们可以帮忙
<9-15,GATES>They can help.

225
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,550
<10-1,CONNORS>我明白调查这案子
<10-1,CONNORS>I understand investigating this case

226
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,850
<10-1,CONNORS>让你的处境非常艰难
<10-1,CONNORS>puts you in a terribly difficult position.

227
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:52,780
<10-3,CONNORS>但我必须跟你聊聊卡塞尔先生
<10-3,CONNORS>But I need to talk to you about Mr. Castle.

228
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,310
<10-3,CONNORS>除了他的家人
<10-3,CONNORS>Outside of his family,

229
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:56,030
<10-3,CONNORS>你是最了解他的人
<10-3,CONNORS>You're the one who knew him best.

230
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:58,830
<10-4,BECKETT>好吧  他很清白
<10-4,BECKETT>Yeah, well, he didn't have any problems with...

231
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:01,150
<10-4,BECKETT>不赌博  不缺钱  不吸毒
<10-4,BECKETT>Gambling, money, drugs,

232
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:03,880
<10-4,BECKETT>也没外遇  所以这些可以跳过了
<10-4,BECKETT>Affairs, so we can skip all of that.

233
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:07,440
<10-5,CONNORS>我知道他被绑的时候
<10-5,CONNORS>I understand he was headed to the Hamptons

234
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,400
<10-5,CONNORS>正开车前往汉普顿
<10-5,CONNORS>When he was abducted.

235
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,720
<10-6,BECKETT>对  我们的婚礼在那举办
<10-6,BECKETT>Yeah. For our wedding.

236
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,690
<10-7,CONNORS>还有谁知道他要开车去那里
<10-7,CONNORS>Who knew he was making that drive?

237
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:13,290
<10-8,BECKETT>婚礼的宾客
<10-8,BECKETT>The wedding guests, um...

238
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:15,490
<10-8,BECKETT>餐饮人员
<10-8,BECKETT>Catering staff.

239
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,080
<10-9,CONNORS>我需要他们的名字
<10-9,CONNORS>I'll need their names.

240
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,130
<10-10,BECKETT>我有名单
<10-10,BECKETT>I've got a list.

241
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:20,280
<10-10,BECKETT>但他们都是亲戚和朋友
<10-10,BECKETT>But they're all friends and family.

242
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:21,390
<10-11,CONNORS>以防万一
<10-11,CONNORS>Still...

243
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:25,310
<10-12,BECKETT>康纳探员  你觉得这会是绑架勒索吗
<10-12,BECKETT>Agent Connors, do you think that this could be a ransom kidnapping?

244
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:26,690
<10-13,CONNORS>如果是  我们会有所准备的
<10-13,CONNORS>If it is, we'll be ready.

245
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,640
<10-13,CONNORS>标准流程  我们会在卡塞尔先生家
<10-13,CONNORS>It's standard protocol to set up a trap-and-trace

246
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,280
<10-13,CONNORS>安装追踪装置
<10-13,CONNORS>in Mr. Castle's loft...

247
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,800
<10-13,CONNORS>以防绑匪打来
<10-13,CONNORS>in the event kidnappers call.

248
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,680
<10-13,CONNORS>我们还会监控家人的电话
<10-13,CONNORS>We'll also monitor family cellphones.

249
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:39,310
<10-14,BECKETT>听起来你好像并没指望会有绑匪打来
<10-14,BECKETT>You sound like you don't expect those phones to ring.

250
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,440
<10-14,BECKETT>康纳探员  你知道什么我不知道的事吗
<10-14,BECKETT>Agent Connors, do you know something that I don't?

251
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,020
<10-15,CONNORS>我只是一直在想
<10-15,CONNORS>I just keep coming back to how much easier

252
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,980
<10-15,CONNORS>如果在城里抓走卡塞尔会容易得多吧
<10-15,CONNORS>it would've been to grab castle in the city.

253
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,960
<10-15,CONNORS>可他们却偏要跑去长岛抓他
<10-15,CONNORS>Instead, they took him on long island,

254
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,000
<10-15,CONNORS>就在他要结婚的时候
<10-15,CONNORS>just as he was about to get married...

255
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,540
<10-15,CONNORS>跟你结婚
<10-15,CONNORS>To you.

256
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:58,160
<10-16,BECKETT>你觉得这事与我有关吗
<10-16,BECKETT>Do you think that this has something to do with me?

257
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:02,050
<10-17,CONNORS>你和卡塞尔先生合作破获过很多案子
<10-17,CONNORS>You and Mr. Castle worked a lot of cases together.

258
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:04,710
<10-17,CONNORS>会不会有谁想报复你
<10-17,CONNORS>Could someone you went after have taken revenge?

259
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:08,850
<10-18,BECKETT>有  有很多
<10-18,BECKETT>Yeah. A lot of people.

260
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:12,840
<10-19,CONNORS>好吧  我先去跟加里·达芬聊聊
<10-19,CONNORS>Okay, well, I'll start by taking a run at Gary Duffin.

261
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,300
<10-19,CONNORS>你去看看卷宗
<10-19,CONNORS>You go through your case files,

262
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,330
<10-19,CONNORS>列一个潜在嫌疑人的名单
<10-19,CONNORS>come up with a list of potential suspects.

263
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,280
<10-19,CONNORS>有发现及时通知我
<10-19,CONNORS>Keep me apprised of what you find.

264
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,490
<10-20,BECKETT>只要你也告诉我你的进展
<10-20,BECKETT>As long as you do the same.

265
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:27,750
<11-1,ALEXIS>他会回来的
<11-1,ALEXIS>He'll come back.

266
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:31,390
<11-2,MARTHA>当然会  亲爱的
<11-2,MARTHA>Of course he will, darling.

267
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:34,390
<11-2,MARTHA>你老爸很快就会回来的
<11-2,MARTHA>Your father will be home before you know it.

269
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:53,580
<11-2,MARTHA>谢谢
<11-2,MARTHA>Thanks.

270
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:54,910
<12-1,BECKETT>我们会找到他的
<12-1,BECKETT>We'll find him.

271
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,960
<12-2,ESPOSITO>康纳探员从达芬嘴里撬出什么了吗
<12-2,ESPOSITO>So, was Agent Connors able to get anything out of Duffin?

272
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,570
<12-3,BECKETT>一个字都没有  他回联调局总部去了
<12-3,BECKETT>Not a word, so he went back to FBI HQ.

273
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,170
<12-4,ESPOSITO>这些是你觉得可能会动卡塞尔的罪犯吗
<12-4,ESPOSITO>Are those the perps you think might've made a move on castle?

274
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:06,870
<12-5,BECKETT>对  首先就是布莱肯议员
<12-5,BECKETT>Yeah. Starting with Senator Bracken.

275
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:08,290
<12-6,ESPOSITO>你觉得是布莱肯指使的
<12-6,ESPOSITO>Oh, you think Bracken's behind this?

276
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:10,730
<12-7,BECKETT>我们毁了他的生活  还让他进了监狱
<12-7,BECKETT>Well, we've ruined his life and had him sent to prison.

277
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,770
<12-7,BECKETT>在卡塞尔前往婚礼的途中拿下他
<12-7,BECKETT>Taking Castle down on his way to our wedding

278
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:14,410
<12-7,BECKETT>太像他的作风了
<12-7,BECKETT>would be just like him.

279
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:17,010
<12-7,BECKETT>这么说的话  也可能是3XK
<12-7,BECKETT>Or like 3XK, for that matter,

280
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,930
<12-7,BECKETT>或是米基·巴博萨
<12-7,BECKETT>Or Mickey Barbosa or any of the other

281
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:22,030
<12-7,BECKETT>我们这几年抓获的好多人都有可能
<12-7,BECKETT>dozens of people we've had put away over the past few years.

282
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,570
<12-7,BECKETT>可能是他们中的任何人
<12-7,BECKETT>I mean, it could be any of them.

283
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:25,050
<12-7,BECKETT>也可能并不在这些人中
<12-7,BECKETT>or none of them.

284
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,340
<12-8,ESPOSITO>我们会查明白的  好吗
<12-8,ESPOSITO>We're gonna figure this out, okay?

285
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:33,190
<12-8,ESPOSITO>凯特  别沉浸在最糟的情况中
<12-8,ESPOSITO>Kate, don't get lost in worst-case scenarios.

286
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:34,430
<12-8,ESPOSITO>当初阿丽克西斯被绑的时候
<12-8,ESPOSITO>When Alexis was taken,

287
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,730
<12-8,ESPOSITO>最后发现跟卡塞尔的父亲有关
<12-8,ESPOSITO>tied back to Castle's dad.

288
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:36,900
<12-8,ESPOSITO>也许这事也跟他有关
<12-8,ESPOSITO>Maybe he's mixed up in this,

289
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,650
<12-8,ESPOSITO>如果这样的话  他一定会照顾他儿子的
<12-8,ESPOSITO>And if he is, he's gonna look out for his son.

290
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:41,870
<12-9,RYAN>不过这事更像是跟黑帮有关
<12-9,RYAN>Except this is shaping up to be more mob-related.

291
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,080
<12-10,BECKETT>为什么这么说
<12-10,BECKETT>What makes you say that?

292
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,620
<12-11,RYAN>我查看了加里·达芬的通话记录
<12-11,RYAN>I ran Gary Duffin's cell records.

293
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,020
<12-11,RYAN>就在他粉碎那辆SUV之前
<12-11,RYAN>Right before he crushed that SUV,

294
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:48,100
<12-11,RYAN>刚刚和一个泽西黑帮成员通过话
<12-11,RYAN>he got a call from a Jersey Mobster.

295
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,960
<12-12,ESPOSITO>那肯定就是那个
<12-12,ESPOSITO>That must be the guy who ordered gary

296
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,770
<12-12,ESPOSITO>下令粉碎那辆车的人  也解释了他为什么不敢招供
<12-12,ESPOSITO>to squash that car, and why he's so scared to talk.

297
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:55,850
<12-14,RYAN>-这个黑手党是谁  -他叫文森特·卡达诺
<12-14,RYAN>- Who is this Mobster? - One Vincent Cardano.

298
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:56,830
<12-15,BECKETT>文尼·卡达诺
<12-15,BECKETT>Vinnie Cardano?

299
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:58,370
<12-15,BECKETT>我见过他
<12-15,BECKETT>I-I met him.

300
00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:59,820
<12-15,BECKETT>卡塞尔认识他
<12-15,BECKETT>Castle knows him.

301
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:02,020
<12-16,RYAN>他们之间有矛盾吗
<12-16,RYAN>Was there ever a problem between them?

302
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:04,250
<12-17,BECKETT>有  还真有
<12-17,BECKETT>Yeah. There was.

303
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:06,500
<13-1,VINNY CARDANO>绝对没有  相信我
<13-1,VINNY CARDANO>No, there wasn't. Trust me.

304
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,840
<13-1,VINNY CARDANO>我和卡塞尔关系很好的
<13-1,VINNY CARDANO>Things are simpatico with me and Castle.

305
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,520
<13-1,VINNY CARDANO>说实话  听说里克失踪了我很难过呢
<13-1,VINNY CARDANO>Fact is, it pains my soul that Rick is missing.

306
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:13,020
<13-1,VINNY CARDANO>我能做点什么
<13-1,VINNY CARDANO>What can I do to help?

307
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:15,710
<13-2,BECKETT>你和他生气大吵一架的当晚我也在场
<13-2,BECKETT>I was there the night that you got angry with him and stormed out.

308
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:17,370
<13-3,CARDANO>他基本上说我是个杀人犯哎
<13-3,CARDANO>He near accused me of murder.

309
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:18,920
<13-3,CARDANO>他质疑了我的正直
<13-3,CARDANO>He impugned my integrity.

310
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,170
<13-3,CARDANO>但是我们早就和好了
<13-3,CARDANO>But we made our peace ages ago

311
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,810
<13-3,CARDANO>还喝了瓶上好的瓦尔波利塞拉葡萄酒呢
<13-3,CARDANO>over a nice bottle of valpolicella.

312
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:25,410
<13-4,BECKETT>那你今天为什么要给加里·达芬打电话
<13-4,BECKETT>Then why did you call Gary Duffin earlier today?

313
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,480
<13-4,BECKETT>是让他去  粉碎某辆SUV吗
<13-4,BECKETT>Was it to tell him to destroy a certain SUV?

314
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:32,090
<13-5,CARDANO>这事和SUV有什么关系
<13-5,CARDANO>What's an SUV got to do with this?

315
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:34,390
<13-6,BECKETT>它和卡塞尔的绑架有关
<13-6,BECKETT>It was involved in Castle's abduction.

316
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,560
<13-7,CARDANO>这我真不知道
<13-7,CARDANO>This I did not know.

317
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,270
<13-8,RYAN>但你确实让加里粉碎那辆车了
<13-8,RYAN>But you did have Gary crush that car.

318
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:42,680
<13-9,CARDANO>这件事的界限比较模糊
<13-9,CARDANO>We're entering into a gray area here.

319
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,160
<13-10,BECKETT>你是个绑架案从犯
<13-10,BECKETT>Uh, you're an accessory to kidnapping.

320
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,620
<13-10,BECKETT>这没什么难界定的
<13-10,BECKETT>There's nothing gray about that.

321
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:46,960
<13-11,CARDANO>我说了  凯特
<13-11,CARDANO>I'm telling you, Kate,

322
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,530
<13-11,CARDANO>我没有绑架里克
<13-11,CARDANO>I did not have Rick grabbed.

323
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:49,720
<13-12,BECKETT>那就别再遮遮掩掩了
<13-12,BECKETT>Then stop playing games

324
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,140
<13-12,BECKETT>告诉我  你为什么要下令粉碎那辆车
<13-12,BECKETT>and tell me -- why did you have the car crushed?

325
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:55,400
<12-15,BECKETT>文尼
<12-15,BECKETT>Vinnie,

326
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,840
<13-11,CARDANO>你说你想要帮他的
<13-11,CARDANO>you said that you wanted to help him.

327
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,250
<13-12,BECKETT>现在就是帮他的机会
<13-12,BECKETT>This is your chance.

328
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,830
<13-13,CARDANO>好吧
<13-13,CARDANO>Okay, listen.

329
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:07,810
<13-13,CARDANO>又时候  会有客户需要让一辆车消失
<13-13,CARDANO>On occasion, clients might need to make a vehicle disappear,

330
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:09,270
<13-13,CARDANO>一万块钱
<13-13,CARDANO>and for 10 grand,

331
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,260
<13-13,CARDANO>这事就能解决
<13-13,CARDANO>such a thing can be handled.

332
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:14,110
<13-14,BECKETT>-这位客人叫什么  -都是不问名字的
<13-14,BECKETT>- What was the name of the client? - No names came up.

333
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:16,440
<13-15,CARDANO>他早上给我来电话  告诉我要求
<13-15,CARDANO>He called me in the morning. He said the right things.

334
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,760
<13-15,CARDANO>敲定交易
<13-15,CARDANO>We struck a deal.

335
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,200
<13-15,CARDANO>但我们没有见面  都是匿名完成的
<13-15,CARDANO>But I never met the man. It was all anonymous.

336
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,480
<13-16,RYAN>那怎么给你付钱呢
<13-16,RYAN>Then how did you get paid?

337
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:22,630
<13-17,CARDANO>定点放钱
<13-17,CARDANO>We used a drop.

338
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:25,260
<13-17,CARDANO>那辆SUV被压扁之后
<13-17,CARDANO>A client left a bag full of cash in a dumpster

339
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,880
<13-17,CARDANO>一个客人在下东区的一个垃圾箱
<13-17,CARDANO>in the lower east side right after the SUV

340
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,720
<13-17,CARDANO>留下了一个装钱
<13-17,CARDANO>got turned into a panini.

341
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,550
<13-17,CARDANO>之后
<13-17,CARDANO>After?

342
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:31,830
<13-18,RYAN>如果你粉碎了车
<13-18,RYAN>What happens if you crush a car

343
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,370
<13-18,RYAN>但他们不付钱怎么办
<13-18,RYAN>and then you don't get your money?

344
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,910
<13-19,CARDANO>这种事不会发生
<13-19,CARDANO>That does not happen.

345
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,750
<13-20,BECKETT>这个垃圾箱在哪
<13-20,BECKETT>Where exactly is this dumpster?

346
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,970
<14-1,TORY ELLIS>根据卡达诺所说
<14-1,TORY ELLIS>Based on what Cardano said,

347
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,680
<14-1,TORY ELLIS>这就是交钱地点
<14-1,TORY ELLIS>this is the drop point.

348
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,630
<14-2,ESPOSITO>我们在看什么
<14-2,ESPOSITO>Now, what are we looking at here?

349
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,380
<14-2,ESPOSITO>这不是街区监控
<14-2,ESPOSITO>This is not street-cam footage.

350
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,790
<14-3,TORY>这个地区没有街区监控
<14-3,TORY>There's no coverage in the area,

351
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,280
<14-3,TORY>但是一系列闯空门事件发生后
<14-3,TORY>but after a rash of break-ins,

352
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,100
<14-3,TORY>一栋大楼装上了隐蔽监控摄像头
<14-3,TORY>one of the buildings installed hidden cameras,

353
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,800
<14-3,TORY>我进了它的系统
<14-3,TORY>and I was able to tap in.

354
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:53,400
<14-3,TORY>这是交钱
<14-3,TORY>This is in the time window

355
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:55,110
<14-3,TORY>应该发生的时段
<14-3,TORY>when the drop should've taken place.

356
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:56,590
<14-4,RYAN>如果我们找到了卡达诺的客人
<14-4,RYAN>If we get eyes on Cardano's client,

357
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:58,920
<14-4,RYAN>也就找到了抓走卡塞尔的人的线索
<14-4,RYAN>we can get a real lead on who took Castle.

358
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,990
<14-5,BECKETT>这里  倒带
<14-5,BECKETT>There. Go back.

359
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:09,190
<14-6,RYAN>就是他  那个客人  丢下了现金
<14-6,RYAN>That's him. That's the client, dropping off the cash.

360
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:10,140
<14-7,ESPOSITO>我去安排排查  总该有人
<14-7,ESPOSITO>I'll set up a canvass. Someone had

361
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,090
<14-7,ESPOSITO>看见了他是从哪来到哪去的
<14-7,ESPOSITO>to see where this guy came from or where he went.

362
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,230
<14-7,ESPOSITO>是  我是埃斯波西托
<14-7,ESPOSITO>Yeah, this is Esposito.

363
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,280
<14-8,BECKETT>-给我接行动组  -等等  暂停
<14-8,BECKETT>- Connect me with operations. - Wait. Freeze that.

364
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:18,350
<14-8,BECKETT>放大
<14-8,BECKETT>Zoom in.

365
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:26,790
<14-9,RYAN>不会吧
<14-9,RYAN>Can't be.

366
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,050
<14-10,ESPOSITO>没错  那是卡塞尔
<14-10,ESPOSITO>It is. That's Castle.

367
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:32,200
<14-10,ESPOSITO>交钱的人是他
<14-10,ESPOSITO>He's the one who dropped off the cash?

368
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,210
<15-1,TORY>要我再放一遍吗
<15-1,TORY>Do you want me to run it again?

369
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:44,270
<15-2,BECKETT>我需要出去冷静一下
<15-2,BECKETT>I need to get some air.

370
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,060
<15-3,RYAN>托瑞  再放一遍吧  谢谢
<15-3,RYAN>Yeah, Tory, one more time, please.

371
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:52,600
<15-4,ESPOSITO>你觉得能还看出什么新花样吗
<15-4,ESPOSITO>What are you gonna see that you didn't see before?

372
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,270
<15-5,RYAN>也许我们是忽略了哪一点
<15-5,RYAN>Maybe we missed something.

373
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,180
<15-5,RYAN>确实是忽略了一点
<15-5,RYAN>Yeah, we missed something.

374
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,810
<15-6,ESPOSITO>卡塞尔也参与了此事  整个事件就是他策划的
<15-6,ESPOSITO>Castle's in on this. He planned the whole thing.

375
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,210
<16-1,RYAN>也许这并不是他本人
<16-1,RYAN>Maybe it isn't really him.

376
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,530
<16-1,RYAN>想想看
<16-1,RYAN>Just think about it.

377
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,370
<16-1,RYAN>3XK的案子  让一个很相像的人
<16-1,RYAN>3Xk, he used a look-alike

378
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:18,380
<16-1,RYAN>想嫁祸他一桩谋杀罪
<16-1,RYAN>to try to frame him for murder --

379
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,650
<16-1,RYAN>-那人和卡塞尔长的一模一样  -不
<16-1,RYAN>- a guy with castle's face. - No.

380
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,510
<16-2,BECKETT>不  凯文  这次不仅是长相
<16-2,BECKETT>No, Kevin, it wasn't just his face.

381
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:26,200
<16-2,BECKETT>那是他的衣服
<16-2,BECKETT>It was his clothes.

382
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,340
<16-2,BECKETT>他的动作  他的身体
<16-2,BECKETT>It was his movements, his body.

383
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,230
<16-2,BECKETT>那就是他本人  一个人
<16-2,BECKETT>It was him, on his own

384
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:36,940
<16-2,BECKETT>而且是在我们以为他被绑架几小时后
<16-2,BECKETT>just hours after he was supposedly abducted.

385
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,530
<16-3,RYAN>贝克特  这完全说不通
<16-3,RYAN>Beckett, this doesn't make any sense.

386
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,270
<16-3,RYAN>卡塞尔不会那么做的  不会的
<16-3,RYAN>He wouldn't do that, not Castle.

387
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:44,330
<16-4,BECKETT>调查一下卡塞尔  好吗
<16-4,BECKETT>Look into Castle, okay?

388
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:46,980
<16-4,BECKETT>看看他失踪前做过什么
<16-4,BECKETT>Find out what he did, who he...

389
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,630
<16-4,BECKETT>跟谁谈过
<16-4,BECKETT>who he talked to just before he went missing,

390
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:51,790
<16-4,BECKETT>然后  跟康纳探员汇报一下
<16-4,BECKETT>and, brief Agent Connors.

391
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:52,940
<16-5,RYAN>你打算干什么
<16-5,RYAN>What are you gonna do now?

392
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:57,290
<16-6,BECKETT>我要去跟他家人谈谈
<16-6,BECKETT>I'm gonna talk to his family.

393
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:08,690
<17-1,ALEXIS>这些照片是在车祸之后
<17-1,ALEXIS>And these images were taken after the accident,

394
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:10,530
<17-1,ALEXIS>-起火之后拍的  -是的
<17-1,ALEXIS>- the car fire? - Yes.

395
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:11,700
<17-3,MARTHA>这说明他还活着
<17-3,MARTHA>So, he's alive!

396
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:14,660
<17-3,MARTHA>-他没有被什么人绑架  -等一下
<17-3,MARTHA>- He's not being held captive by God knows who. - Wait.

397
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:17,550
<17-4,ALEXIS>你是说老爸的车被一辆SUV撞到路边后
<17-4,ALEXIS>Are you saying dad was run off the road by an SUV

398
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,650
<17-4,ALEXIS>他花钱让人把那辆车报废掉
<17-4,ALEXIS>And after that, he paid to have it crushed?

399
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,190
<17-5,BECKETT>-看上去是这样的  -太荒唐了
<17-5,BECKETT>- It looks that way, yeah. - Well, that's ridiculous.

400
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:23,830
<17-6,MARTHA>他为什么要这么做
<17-6,MARTHA>Why on earth would he do such a thing?

401
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,740
<17-7,BECKETT>他是不是遇到了我并不知情的什么事
<17-7,BECKETT>Was he going through anything that I didn't know about?

402
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:29,930
<17-8,MARTHA>什么事
<17-8,MARTHA>Like what?

403
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:33,680
<17-9,BECKETT>有什么压力  他自己一个人扛着
<17-9,BECKETT>Pressure that he was under that he kept to himself.

404
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:34,670
<17-10,ALEXIS>当然没有
<17-10,ALEXIS>Of course not.

405
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,420
<17-10,ALEXIS>对吧  奶奶
<17-10,ALEXIS>Right, gram?

406
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,740
<17-11,MARTHA>没有  没有  有的话我会发现的
<17-11,MARTHA>No, no, no, no. I would've noticed.

407
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,430
<17-12,BECKETT>那关于婚礼呢
<17-12,BECKETT>And what about the wedding?

408
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:44,100
<17-12,BECKETT>他是不是有什么疑虑
<17-12,BECKETT>Did he have any misgivings?

409
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,960
<17-12,BECKETT>疑虑
<17-12,BECKETT>Misgivings?

410
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:49,460
<17-13,MARTHA>凯萨琳
<17-13,MARTHA>Katherine.

411
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:52,650
<17-13,MARTHA>他绝对不可能有疑虑
<17-13,MARTHA>That was the farthest thing from his mind.

412
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:54,870
<17-13,MARTHA>他都等不及要娶你了
<17-13,MARTHA>He couldn't wait to be married to you.

413
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:58,910
<17-14,ALEXIS>你不会觉得他是逃掉了吧
<17-14,ALEXIS>You don't think he'd just walk away, do you?

414
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:04,580
<17-15,BECKETT>不
<17-15,BECKETT>No.

415
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,410
<17-16,MARTHA>那你是什么意思
<17-16,MARTHA>Then what's going on here?

416
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:08,030
<17-16,MARTHA>不知道
<17-16,MARTHA>I don't know.

417
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:11,170
<17-17,BECKETT>但肯定有别的原因
<17-17,BECKETT>But there's got to be another explanation.

418
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,010
<18-1,AGENT CONNORS>我觉得没有
<18-1,AGENT CONNORS>I don't think there is.

419
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,750
<18-1,AGENT CONNORS>那段视频清楚得显示了卡塞尔活得好好的
<18-1,AGENT CONNORS>The video clearly shows Castle out in the world,

420
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:16,920
<18-1,AGENT CONNORS>没有被胁迫
<18-1,AGENT CONNORS>not under duress.

421
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,870
<18-1,AGENT CONNORS>这改变了案子的情况
<18-1,AGENT CONNORS>It changes the dynamics of the case.

422
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,920
<18-2,BECKETT>不  这还是一起绑架案
<18-2,BECKETT>No, this is still a kidnapping.

423
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,920
<18-2,BECKETT>那段视频可能是假的
<18-2,BECKETT>That video could be a fake.

424
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:26,660
<18-2,BECKETT>只能说明卡塞尔扔掉了一包东西
<18-2,BECKETT>All it shows is Castle throwing away a bag.

425
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,830
<18-2,BECKETT>-可能是一个月之前拍的  -不是
<18-2,BECKETT>- That could've been shot a month ago. - It wasn't.

426
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:30,740
<18-3,CONNORS>我们的技术组分析了那段视频
<18-3,CONNORS>Our tech team analyzed the footage.

427
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:31,850
<18-3,CONNORS>是真实的
<18-3,CONNORS>It's authentic.

428
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:37,000
<18-3,CONNORS>你知不知道他在失踪前取了一大笔现金
<18-3,CONNORS>Were you aware he withdrew a large sum just before he disappeared?

429
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,840
<18-4,BECKETT>是的  是为了我们的蜜月
<18-4,BECKETT>Yes. It was for our honeymoon.

430
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:39,940
<18-4,BECKETT>文尼·卡达诺
<18-4,BECKETT>Vinnie Cardano

431
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:43,360
<18-5,CONNORS>把垃圾箱里的一万块钱上交了
<18-5,CONNORS>turned over the $10,000 that was left in the dumpster.

432
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:46,730
<18-5,CONNORS>就是卡塞尔取的那笔钱
<18-5,CONNORS>It's the same money that Castle withdrew.

433
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,100
<18-6,BECKETT>这不可能
<18-6,BECKETT>That's not possible.

434
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,000
<18-7,CONNORS>那是因为你沉浸在自己的想法里
<18-7,CONNORS>That's because you're locked into your own version of events,

435
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:54,430
<18-7,CONNORS>警探  我可以给你看纸币
<18-7,CONNORS>But, detective, I can show you those bills,

436
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,510
<18-7,CONNORS>钱的序号是吻合的
<18-7,CONNORS>The matching serial numbers.

437
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,330
<18-8,BECKETT>肯定有什么别的事
<18-8,BECKETT>There's something else going on.

438
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,520
<18-8,BECKETT>一定是
<18-8,BECKETT>There has to be.

439
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,210
<18-9,CONNORS>一切都清楚了
<18-9,CONNORS>It all lines up,

440
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:15,980
<18-9,CONNORS>卡塞尔认识卡达诺
<18-9,CONNORS>right down to the fact that Castle knew Cardano,

441
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,960
<18-9,CONNORS>知道他能让车辆消失
<18-9,CONNORS>knew he could make cars vanish.

442
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:19,300
<18-10,BECKETT>所以呢
<18-10,BECKETT>So...  what?

443
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:20,590
<18-10,BECKETT>他费了这么大劲
<18-10,BECKETT>He went through this charade

444
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,420
<18-10,BECKETT>就是为了让自己消失吗
<18-10,BECKETT>just to stage his own disappearance?

445
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,400
<18-10,BECKETT>为什么
<18-10,BECKETT>Why?

446
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:30,160
<18-11,CONNORS>人是很复杂的
<18-11,CONNORS>People are complex.

447
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:34,620
<18-11,CONNORS>可能他崩溃了  或者遇到了危机
<18-11,CONNORS>Maybe he had a breakdown or a personal crisis.

448
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:37,030
<18-11,CONNORS>也可能他有秘密的一面
<18-11,CONNORS>And maybe there's a secret side to the man

449
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,790
<18-11,CONNORS>别人都不知道
<18-11,CONNORS>that nobody knows.

450
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:40,660
<18-11,CONNORS>包括你
<18-11,CONNORS>Including you.

451
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:44,870
<18-12,BECKETT>听我说  康纳探员
<18-12,BECKETT>Look, Agent Connors...

452
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:49,680
<18-12,BECKETT>我知道现在有很多无法解答的问题
<18-12,BECKETT>I know that there are a lot of unanswered questions here,

453
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,240
<18-12,BECKETT>但你必须得继续找他
<18-12,BECKETT>but you cannot stop looking for him.

454
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:55,010
<18-13,CONNORS>我们会追查每一条线索
<18-13,CONNORS>We'll follow every lead to the end.

455
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,510
<18-13,CONNORS>但如果线索都断了
<18-13,CONNORS>But once those leads dry up,

456
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,060
<18-13,CONNORS>我们就只能缩小调查的规模了
<18-13,CONNORS>we have to scale back our investigation.

457
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:04,000
<18-14,BECKETT>我一定会找到卡塞尔
<18-14,BECKETT>I will find Castle.

458
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,890
<18-14,BECKETT>无论有没有联调局的帮助
<18-14,BECKETT>With or without the FBI.

459
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:10,460
<18-15,CONNORS>你是假设他想被人找到
<18-15,CONNORS>You're assuming he wants to be found.

460
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,450
<19-1,BECKETT>我是凯特·贝克特探长
<19-1,BECKETT>My name is Detective Kate Beckett.

461
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:18,050
<19-1,BECKETT>纽约警局凶案组的

462
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,500
<19-1,BECKETT>想问一下最近有没有...
<19-1,BECKETT>Calling to see if there was any recent activity...

463
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,210
<19-1,BECKETT>有没有一个叫理查德·卡塞尔的男士
<19-1,BECKETT>To see if you had a gentleman named Richard Castle

464
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:24,100
<19-1,BECKETT>在过去48小时内入住你们的酒店
<19-1,BECKETT>check into your hotel over the last 48 hours.

465
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,290
<19-1,BECKETT>身高大约一米八七
<19-1,BECKETT>He's about 6'2".

466
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:27,530
<19-1,BECKETT>查查当地航空公司  加油站
<19-1,BECKETT>Take a look at local airlines, gas stations...

467
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:28,530
<19-1,BECKETT>调出交通监控视频
<19-1,BECKETT>and pull traffic cameras.

468
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:30,450
<19-1,BECKETT>交通录像  汉普顿的交通摄像头
<19-1,BECKETT>Traffic footage. Traffic cams in the Hamptons.

00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,560
<19-1,BECKETT>...卡塞尔的神秘失踪
<19-1,BECKETT>Castle's mysterious disappearance.

472
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,930
<19-2,NEWS REPORTER>联调局探员们已经离开了纽约警局12分局
<19-2,NEWS REPORTER>FBI agents left the NYPD's 12th precinct.

475
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:50,600
<19-3,BECKETT>马克  你能帮我接一下法国领事馆吗
<19-3,BECKETT>Hey, Mark, can you put me in to the French Consulate?

476
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,040
<19-3,BECKETT>我是从美国打来的
<19-3,BECKETT>Calling from the United State.

00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,240
<19-3,BECKETT>我需要跟...  我是一名警探
<19-3,BECKETT>I need to speak with the... Je suis un détective.

479
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,480
<19-3,BECKETT>是关于一位理查德·卡塞尔先生
<19-3,BECKETT>In regards to a Richard Castle.

480
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:57,000
<19-4,BECKETT>汉普顿那边有什么新消息吗
<19-4,BECKETT>Okay, anything coming out of the Hamptons?

481
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,230
<19-4,BECKETT>过去两周内  我去看下我邮箱
<19-4,BECKETT>For the past two weeks, yeah. Okay, I'll look for it in my e-mail.

482
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:00,920
<19-4,BECKETT>不  我现在就要
<19-4,BECKETT>No, I need it right away.

483
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,980
<20-1,COAST GUARD SHIP>我们是美国海岸警卫队
<20-1,COAST GUARD SHIP>This is the United States coast guard.

484
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,540
<20-1,COAST GUARD SHIP>如果你遇险或需要帮助
<20-1,COAST GUARD SHIP>Please respond if you are in distress

485
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,850
<20-1,COAST GUARD SHIP>请予以回应
<20-1,COAST GUARD SHIP>or need assistance.

486
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:44,430
<20-1,COAST GUARD SHIP>海岸警卫队巡逻时在特拉华口岸80里外处
<20-1,COAST GUARD SHIP>He was found adrift 80 miles off the coast of Delaware

487
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:47,340
<21-1,ESPOSITO>发现他昏迷躺在一艘小艇上
<21-1,ESPOSITO>by a coast guard cutter that was out there mapping the currents.

488
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,600
<21-2,RYAN>船长认出了卡塞尔  并把他送到了这里
<21-2,RYAN>Captain recognized who he was and had him airlifted here.

489
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,690
<21-3,BECKETT>他在大西洋上干什么
<21-3,BECKETT>What was he doing in the middle of the Atlantic ocean?

490
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:53,630
<21-4,RYAN>而且还是在一个有三个弹孔的小艇上
<21-4,RYAN>Yeah, especially in a dinghy with three bullet holes in it.

491
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:55,990
<21-5,BECKETT>-他中枪了吗  -船长说他没有  但医生拒绝
<21-5,BECKETT>-He was shot? - The captain said no, but the doctors here

492
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:57,960
<21-6,ESPOSITO>向我们告知他的最新情况
<21-6,ESPOSITO>won't give us any updates on his condition.

493
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,340
<21-7,BECKETT>玛莎和阿丽克西斯在哪
<21-7,BECKETT>Where are Martha and Alexis?

494
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,480
<21-8,ESPOSITO>-坐巡逻车正赶过来呢  -知道了
<21-8,ESPOSITO>- In a patrol car on their way in now. - Okay.

495
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,390
<21-9,BECKETT>凯特
<21-9,BECKETT>Kate?

496
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,130
<21-10,ESPOSITO>我没事
<21-10,ESPOSITO>I'm fine.

497
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:19,330
<21-11,BECKETT>我只是没想到还能再见到他
<21-11,BECKETT>I just never thought I'd see him again.

498
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:44,620
<21-12,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<21-12,BECKETT>Castle.

499
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:46,860
<21-12,BECKETT>你好吗
<21-12,BECKETT>Hey.

500
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:50,750
<21-12,BECKETT>是我
<21-12,BECKETT>It's me.

501
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,200
<21-13,ALEXIS>爸爸
<21-13,ALEXIS>Dad?!

502
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:03,020
<21-14,MARTHA>理查德  亲爱的
<21-14,MARTHA>Richard, darling.

503
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:06,990
<21-15,ALEXIS>他怎么了
<21-15,ALEXIS>What's wrong with him?

504
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:11,170
<21-15,ALEXIS>卡塞尔身上没什么明显伤痕
<21-15,ALEXIS>Mr. Castle hasn't sustained any serious injuries,

505
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:13,370
<21-15,ALEXIS>身体也在好转
<21-15,ALEXIS>and his vital signs continue to improve,

506
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,420
<21-15,ALEXIS>但他需要时间
<21-15,ALEXIS>But he is recovering

507
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:17,400
<22-1,MARTHA>从暴晒和脱水中恢复过来
<22-1,MARTHA>from the effects of exposure and dehydration.

508
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:19,300
<22-2,ALEXIS>可他为什么还不醒呢
<22-2,ALEXIS>Why hasn't he regained consciousness?

509
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,950
<22-2,ALEXIS>我们在做其它测试  希望能找出原因
<22-2,ALEXIS>We're running some additional tests to find out,

510
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:21,660
<22-2,ALEXIS>但目前为止
<22-2,ALEXIS>but at this point,

511
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,730
<22-3,MARTHA>没什么要特别担心的
<22-3,MARTHA>we don't think there's any cause for alarm.

512
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,030
<22-3,MARTHA>如果允许的话
<22-3,MARTHA>But we'd like to stay with him,

513
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:26,550
<22-3,MARTHA>我们想陪在他身边
<22-3,MARTHA>keep him company, if that's all right.

514
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,930
<22-4,MARTHA>-没问题  -谢谢你
<22-4,MARTHA>- Of course. - Thank you.

515
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:28,690
<22-4,MARTHA>凯特
<22-4,MARTHA>Kate!

516
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,880
<22-5,LANIE PARISH>他怎么样了
<22-5,LANIE PARISH>How is he?

517
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,650
<22-6,BECKETT>情况稳定了  但依然昏迷不醒
<22-6,BECKETT>He's stable, but he's still unconscious.

518
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:36,790
<22-7,LANIE>-我们还是不知道发生什么了吗  -是的
<22-7,LANIE>- So we still don't know what happened to him? - No.

519
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,010
<22-9,LANIE>有什么我能帮得上忙的
<22-9,LANIE>Well, if there's anything I can do...

520
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:41,780
<22-10,BECKETT>我需要你帮忙看看他
<22-10,BECKETT>Actually, yeah, I need you to take a look at him.

521
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,690
<22-11,LANIE>你知道的  看病不是我专长
<22-11,LANIE>You do know living patients aren't my thing, right?

522
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:47,240
<22-12,BECKETT>不  蕾妮  我不是要你诊断他
<22-12,BECKETT>No, Lanie, look, I don't want you to treat him.

523
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,830
<22-12,BECKETT>我只是要你看看有何蹊跷之处
<22-12,BECKETT>I want you to look at him as if it was a case.

524
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:51,560
<22-12,BECKETT>有没有留下什么证据
<22-12,BECKETT>See if you can find any evidence

525
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,680
<22-12,BECKETT>证明他去过哪   经历过什么
<22-12,BECKETT>of where he's been - and what he's been through.

526
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,830
<22-13,LANIE>-我尽量仔细查查  -好
<22-13,LANIE>- I'll see what I can do. - Okay. - All right.

527
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,020
<23-1,RYAN>我和贝克特一样
<23-1,RYAN>I'm with Beckett --

528
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,720
<23-1,RYAN>没想过还能见到卡塞尔
<23-1,RYAN>I never thought we'd see Castle again.

529
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:04,680
<23-1,RYAN>不过
<23-1,RYAN>Still...

530
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,300
<23-2,ESPOSITO>他这段时间去哪了
<23-2,ESPOSITO>Where's he been?

531
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,550
<23-3,RYAN>你看那些弹孔了
<23-3,RYAN>You saw those bullet holes.

532
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:10,430
<23-3,RYAN>也许是他试图从绑架者那逃出来时留下的
<23-3,RYAN>Maybe he used the boat to escape from whoever abducted him.

533
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:14,020
<23-4,ESPOSITO>他伪造自己的绑架案  然后跑掉
<23-4,ESPOSITO>The guy faked his own kidnapping and then ran off.

534
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,390
<23-4,ESPOSITO>他怎么能这么对贝克特呢
<23-4,ESPOSITO>Now, how could he do that to Beckett?

535
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:17,500
<23-5,RYAN>我们了解卡塞尔  并肩奋战了这么久
<23-5,RYAN>As long as we've known him, worked with him,

536
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:20,200
<23-5,RYAN>你就不能在证据不足的情况下  相信他吗
<23-5,RYAN>don't you think Castle deserves the benefit of the doubt?

537
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:29,490
<23-6,BECKETT>兄弟们  没人知道卡塞尔身上发生了什么
<23-6,BECKETT>You guys, none of us knows the truth about Castle.

538
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,320
<23-6,BECKETT>至少到目前为止
<23-6,BECKETT>Not yet.

539
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:32,860
<23-6,BECKETT>埃斯波  你知道吗
<23-6,BECKETT>And, Espo, you know what?

540
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:34,490
<23-6,BECKETT>如果你是错的  那他就是受害者
<23-6,BECKETT>If you're wrong, then he was a victim.

541
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:35,940
<23-6,BECKETT>与其我们在这等着他苏醒
<23-6,BECKETT>So instead of us just standing around

542
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:38,140
<23-6,BECKETT>不如我们去查查
<23-6,BECKETT>waiting for him to wake up, why don't we start

543
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:40,430
<23-6,BECKETT>那艘小艇是谁的
<23-6,BECKETT>by figuring out who owns that dinghy?

544
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:41,330
<23-7,RYAN>已经在查了
<23-7,RYAN>Already on it.

545
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:42,620
<23-7,RYAN>那艘艇以前注册在
<23-7,RYAN>The boat had expired tags

546
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:44,870
<23-7,RYAN>佐治亚州萨凡纳市的柯蒂斯·霍尔特名下
<23-7,RYAN>registered to a Curtis Holt of Savannah, Georgia.

547
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:45,880
<23-8,ESPOSITO>我们给他打了电话
<23-8,ESPOSITO>We called holt.

548
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:46,850
<23-8,ESPOSITO>他说一年前
<23-8,ESPOSITO>He said that he sold it

549
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:48,420
<23-8,ESPOSITO>在车库甩卖时卖掉了
<23-8,ESPOSITO>over a year ago at a garage sale.

550
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,690
<23-8,ESPOSITO>他想不起来卖给谁了
<23-8,ESPOSITO>He can't recall who he sold it to.

551
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:51,970
<23-9,BECKETT>查下他说的是否属实  同时找到当前所有者
<23-9,BECKETT>Okay. Check his story. Find the current owner.

552
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:53,480
<23-9,BECKETT>找到船主  我们就能知道
<23-9,BECKETT>We find the owner, we'll figure out

553
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,840
<23-9,BECKETT>卡塞尔去了哪
<23-9,BECKETT>where Castle was coming from.

554
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:56,530
<23-9,BECKETT>同时  我会去找船长谈谈
<23-9,BECKETT>In the meantime, I'll talk to the ship's captain

555
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:58,120
<23-9,BECKETT>看他能否提供其他线索
<23-9,BECKETT>and see - if he can tell us anything else.

556
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:03,270
<24-1,CAPTAIN MUNDY>根据卡塞尔先生的状况  我猜测他已经
<24-1,CAPTAIN MUNDY>Based on Mr. Castle's condition, I'm guessing he'd been

557
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:05,020
<24-1,CAPTAIN MUNDY>在那小艇上躺了四五天
<24-1,CAPTAIN MUNDY>in that vessel four or five days.

558
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:07,210
<24-2,BECKETT>那小艇会不会是某艘大船上的
<24-2,BECKETT>Okay, could the dinghy have come from a larger boat?

559
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:08,360
<24-3,MUNDY>不像
<24-3,MUNDY>Not likely.

560
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:11,350
<24-3,MUNDY>你看  艇上有保护油漆的碰垫
<24-3,MUNDY>See, it has fenders, or pads, to protect the paint,

561
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:12,750
<24-3,MUNDY>而且依碰垫的位置
<24-3,MUNDY>and the position of the fenders

562
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,260
<24-3,MUNDY>它应该是系在某个码头的
<24-3,MUNDY>points to it being moored at a dock.

563
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:16,070
<24-4,BECKETT>有办法查到是哪个码头吗
<24-4,BECKETT>Is there any way to know where that dock is?

564
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,660
<24-5,MUNDY>我只能告诉你我的猜测
<24-5,MUNDY>I could give you my best guess.

565
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:19,660
<24-5,MUNDY>小艇有六马力发动机
<24-5,MUNDY>The dinghy had a six-horse motor,

566
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,970
<24-5,MUNDY>如果油箱满油  能行驶两小时
<24-5,MUNDY>two hours worth of fuel if the tanks were full.

567
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,290
<24-5,MUNDY>待燃油耗尽  在海上飘个
<24-5,MUNDY>After it ran dry, it drifted for...

568
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,620
<24-5,MUNDY>四五天
<24-5,MUNDY>four or five days.

569
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:28,200
<24-5,MUNDY>结合风向风速和当时的水流矢量
<24-5,MUNDY>So based on wind and current vectors,

570
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:31,080
<24-5,MUNDY>它应该是从罗德岛和南缅因之间
<24-5,MUNDY>it probably launched somewhere between Rhode island

571
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,290
<24-5,MUNDY>的某个码头驶出的
<24-5,MUNDY>and Southern Maine.

572
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:33,850
<25-1,ESPOSITO>找到线索了
<25-1,ESPOSITO>Looks like we caught a break.

573
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:35,250
<25-1,ESPOSITO>那艘天蓝色的小艇
<25-1,ESPOSITO>Turns out that sky-blue dinghy

574
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:37,380
<25-1,ESPOSITO>出厂时是标准的白色
<25-1,ESPOSITO>was a standard white when it came out of the factory.

575
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,760
<25-2,BECKETT>这信息有什么用吗
<25-2,BECKETT>And how does that help us?

576
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:40,460
<25-3,ESPOSITO>前任船主重新改装过
<25-3,ESPOSITO>Well, the previous owner pimped it out.

577
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:42,480
<25-3,ESPOSITO>他加装了定制鱼竿架
<25-3,ESPOSITO>He added custom fishing-rod holders

578
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,470
<25-3,ESPOSITO>并把船漆成了天蓝色
<25-3,ESPOSITO>and painted it sky-blue.

579
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:45,980
<25-4,RYAN>让这艘船几乎成了同类中独一无二的了
<25-4,RYAN>Making it a relative rarity in the world of dinghies.

580
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,970
<25-5,ESPOSITO>根据船长告诉你的信息
<25-5,ESPOSITO>So, going off what the captain told you,

581
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:50,240
<25-5,ESPOSITO>我们发出了通告
<25-5,ESPOSITO>we put out a bolo on all sky-blue dinghies

582
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,920
<25-5,ESPOSITO>让从罗德岛到缅因州沿岸各执法部门留意
<25-5,ESPOSITO>to all law enforcement along the coast

583
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,080
<25-5,ESPOSITO>所有的天蓝色小艇
<25-5,ESPOSITO>from Rhode island to Maine.

584
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:53,750
<25-6,RYAN>我们找到了
<25-6,RYAN>We got a hit.

585
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,330
<25-6,RYAN>马萨诸塞州格洛斯特的公园管理员
<25-6,RYAN>Park ranger in Gloucester, Massachusetts,

586
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:57,060
<25-6,RYAN>想起曾在一私人码头见过一艘
<25-6,RYAN>recalls seeing it at a private dock.

587
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,900
<25-7,ESPOSITO>这是网上的卫星照片  摄于一个月前
<25-7,ESPOSITO>This is a satellite photo off the web taken a month ago.

588
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:02,440
<25-7,ESPOSITO>这就是公园管理员提到的私人码头
<25-7,ESPOSITO>This is the private dock the ranger was talking about.

589
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,680
<25-8,BECKETT>还有那艘天蓝色小艇
<25-8,BECKETT>And there's the sky-blue dinghy.

590
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,510
<25-9,RYAN>连同定制的鱼竿架
<25-9,RYAN>Complete with custom fishing-rod holders.

591
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,410
<25-9,RYAN>和发现卡塞尔的那艘完全一样
<25-9,RYAN>Just like the one Castle was found in.

592
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:09,450
<25-9,RYAN>好  那么
<25-9,RYAN>Okay, so...

593
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:11,800
<25-10,BECKETT>这看起来是个移动式住房
<25-10,BECKETT>This looks like a mobile home.

594
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,020
<25-10,BECKETT>这个码头是它的吗
<25-10,BECKETT>Does the dock belong to it?

595
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:15,070
<25-11,ESPOSITO>它们都是属于一个叫做
<25-11,ESPOSITO>It's all part of the same property

596
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:16,760
<25-11,ESPOSITO>亨利·詹金斯的财产
<25-11,ESPOSITO>owned by one Henry Jenkins.

597
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:18,700
<25-11,ESPOSITO>不论卡塞尔发生了什么
<25-11,ESPOSITO>Whatever's going on with Castle,

598
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,320
<25-11,ESPOSITO>这里就是源头
<25-11,ESPOSITO>this is where he came from.

599
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,370
<25-11,ESPOSITO>这家伙也肯定牵扯其中
<25-11,ESPOSITO>And this guy must be involved.

600
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,760
<26-1,BECKETT>谢谢替我们把控局面  西姆斯警佐
<26-1,BECKETT>Thanks for holding down the fort, Sergeant Simms.

601
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:31,820
<26-2,SERGEANT SIMMS>我只不过在这监视这移动式住房而已
<26-2,SERGEANT SIMMS>All I did was hang around and watch a mobile home.

602
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:32,790
<26-2,SERGEANT SIMMS>到底发生了什么
<26-2,SERGEANT SIMMS>What's this all about?

603
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:35,240
<26-3,ESPOSITO>我们要找户主  亨利·詹金斯  你认识吗
<26-3,ESPOSITO>It's about the owner, Henry Jenkins. Do you know him?

604
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,680
<26-4,SIMMS>不  我们不常来这附近
<26-4,SIMMS>No. We don't get over here too much.

605
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,000
<26-4,SIMMS>不论他是谁  他现在不在家
<26-4,SIMMS>Whoever he is, he's not home.

606
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,030
<26-4,SIMMS>我没看到有人走动
<26-4,SIMMS>I didn't notice any signs of life.

607
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:41,630
<26-5,BECKETT>接下来就交给我们吧
<26-5,BECKETT>Okay, well, we'll take it over from here.

608
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:43,020
<26-6,SIMMS>如果需要帮忙就用无线电呼叫我
<26-6,SIMMS>I'm a radio call away if you need me.

609
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:43,840
<26-7,BECKETT>多谢
<26-7,BECKETT>Thank you.

610
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:50,860
<26-8,RYAN>看来亨利·詹金斯把他网上的踪迹都抹去了
<26-8,RYAN>Looks like Henry Jenkins scrubbed himself off the web.

611
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:53,270
<26-8,RYAN>托瑞能查到的我们都已经知道了
<26-8,RYAN>All Tory can find out is what we already know.

612
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:55,470
<26-8,RYAN>他在波士顿开了一家私人安保公司
<26-8,RYAN>He runs a private security firm in Boston.

613
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:57,140
<26-9,ESPOSITO>我们还是不知道是什么样的安保公司
<26-9,ESPOSITO>And we still don't know what kind of security.

614
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:59,560
<26-9,ESPOSITO>是商场保安还是军事承包商呢
<26-9,ESPOSITO>Are we talking mall cops or military contractor?

615
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,900
<26-10,BECKETT>不论哪个  他都可以接触到枪械
<26-10,BECKETT>Either way, that would give him access to firearms,

616
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:05,260
<26-10,BECKETT>这也说明了船上为什么有弹孔
<26-10,BECKETT>which could explain the bullet holes in the boat.

617
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:07,080
<26-11,ESPOSITO>不过他和卡塞尔之间的联系又是什么呢
<26-11,ESPOSITO>But what's the link between him and Castle?

618
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,420
<26-11,ESPOSITO>为什么他会和这样一个人扯上关系
<26-11,ESPOSITO>Why would he be mixed up with this guy?

619
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:10,200
<26-12,BECKETT>是蕾妮  可能有什么消息
<26-12,BECKETT>It's Lanie. She may have something.

620
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,030
<26-12,BECKETT>就位
<26-12,BECKETT>Stand by.

621
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,090
<26-13,LANIE>凯特  我说服卡塞尔的医生
<26-13,LANIE>Kate, I talked Castle's doctor

622
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,440
<26-13,LANIE>让我检查了一下
<26-13,LANIE>into letting me look him over,

623
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,900
<26-13,LANIE>我发现了一些  奇怪的东西
<26-13,LANIE>and I came across a few... strange things.

624
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,270
<26-14,BECKETT>怎么奇怪
<26-14,BECKETT>Strange how?

625
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,620
<26-15,LANIE>卡塞尔的衣服上没有任何线索
<26-15,LANIE>No trace evidence on Castle's clothes.

626
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:27,210
<26-15,LANIE>不过我找到一把缝到他裤子衬里的钥匙
<26-15,LANIE>But I did find a key sewn into the lining of his pants.

627
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:28,580
<26-16,BECKETT>什么样的钥匙
<26-16,BECKETT>What kind of a key?

628
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:29,680
<26-17,LANIE>我说不上来
<26-17,LANIE>I'm not sure,

629
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,020
<26-17,LANIE>不过上面有个"38"的印记
<26-17,LANIE>but it has "38" Stamped on it.

630
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:34,090
<26-17,LANIE>-能让你想到什么吗  -想不到
<26-17,LANIE>- That mean anything to you? - No.

631
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:34,980
<26-18,BECKETT>好吧
<26-18,BECKETT>Okay.

632
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,840
<26-19,LANIE>还有就是他的血液检查结果
<26-19,LANIE>Then there's his blood work.

633
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:40,400
<26-19,LANIE>我发现他有登革热的抗体
<26-19,LANIE>I found antibodies to dengue fever.

634
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:42,510
<26-19,LANIE>也就是说卡塞尔在过去两月里
<26-19,LANIE>That means Castle was exposed to the virus

635
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:44,240
<26-19,LANIE>曾感染过这病毒
<26-19,LANIE>within the last two months.

636
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:46,530
<26-20,BECKETT>等等  登革热不是热带的吗
<26-20,BECKETT>Wait. Isn't dengue fever tropical?

637
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:47,230
<26-20,BECKETT>是啊
<26-20,BECKETT>Yeah!

638
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:50,010
<26-21,LANIE>它主要分布在拉丁美洲
<26-21,LANIE>It's mostly found in Latin America,

639
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:51,740
<26-21,LANIE>非洲和亚洲
<26-21,LANIE>Africa, and Asia.

640
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,910
<26-22,BECKETT>这一点也说不通啊
<26-22,BECKETT>That doesn't make any sense.

641
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:54,690
<26-23,LANIE>我发现的枪伤也说不通
<26-23,LANIE>Neither does the bullet wound I found.

642
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:56,740
<26-23,LANIE>卡塞尔的肋下被子弹擦伤
<26-23,LANIE>Castle was grazed across the ribs.

643
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:58,200
<26-24,BECKETT>这个还是可以说通的
<26-24,BECKETT>Okay, that makes a little bit more sense.

644
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,410
<26-24,BECKETT>艇上有弹孔
<26-24,BECKETT>There were bullet holes on the boat.

645
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:01,420
<26-25,LANIE>可这伤口已基本愈合了
<26-25,LANIE>But this wound was mainly healed.

646
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,380
<26-25,LANIE>他是几周之前受伤的
<26-25,LANIE>He was shot a few weeks ago.

647
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:04,850
<26-26,BECKETT>几周之前
<26-26,BECKETT>A few weeks ago?

648
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:06,130
<26-26,BECKETT>你确定吗
<26-26,BECKETT>Are you sure?

649
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:07,540
<26-27,LANIE>或许更久
<26-27,LANIE>Maybe even longer.

650
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:11,520
<26-27,LANIE>凯特  卡塞尔到底遇上什么麻烦了
<26-27,LANIE>Kate, what the hell was Castle mixed up in?

652
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:15,960
<26-28,RYAN>我看见窗帘动了  里面有人
<26-28,RYAN>I just saw the curtain move. Someone's in there.

653
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:16,850
<26-29,BECKETT>一会儿打给你
<26-29,BECKETT>I'll call you back.

654
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:18,690
<26-30,BECKETT>行动
<26-30,BECKETT>Let's go.

655
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:22,490
<26-31,ESPOSITO>你看到是什么人了吗
<26-31,ESPOSITO>Did you get eyes on anyone?

656
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:23,230
<26-32,RYAN>没有
<26-32,RYAN>Negative.

657
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:25,890
<26-33,ESPOSITO>趴在地上
<26-33,ESPOSITO>On the ground!

658
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:26,460
<26-33,ESPOSITO>马上趴在地上
<26-33,ESPOSITO>Get down on the ground!

659
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:29,340
<26-34,RYAN>把你的手放在我能看见的地方  马上
<26-34,RYAN>Put your hands where I can see 'em now, now, now!

660
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,360
<26-35,ESPOSITO>袋子里是什么
<26-35,ESPOSITO>What's in the bags?

661
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,650
<26-36,HENRY JENKINS>垃圾  垃圾
<26-36,HENRY JENKINS>Trash! Trash!

662
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,170
<26-36,HENRY JENKINS>我就是出来倒垃圾的
<26-36,HENRY JENKINS>I was taking out the trash!

663
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,670
<27-1,BECKETT>跟我说说理查德·卡塞尔
<27-1,BECKETT>Talk to me about Richard Castle.

664
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:39,540
<27-2,JENKINS>我跟你说了  我不认识这个人
<27-2,JENKINS>I'm telling you, I don't know the guy.

665
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:40,920
<27-2,JENKINS>我都根本没听说这个人
<27-2,JENKINS>I mean, I've never even heard of him.

666
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,460
<27-3,ESPOSITO>没有其他人来过的迹象
<27-3,ESPOSITO>There's no sign that anyone else has been here.

667
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:44,330
<27-4,JENKINS>因为就我一个会来这
<27-4,JENKINS>'Cause no one comes here but me.

668
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:45,830
<27-4,JENKINS>这里是我度周末的地方
<27-4,JENKINS>This is my weekend place.

669
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:48,300
<27-5,BECKETT>这是你的船  是吗
<27-5,BECKETT>This is your boat, correct?

670
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:49,740
<27-6,JENKINS>好像是
<27-6,JENKINS>It would appear to be.

671
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:50,820
<27-7,BECKETT>如果你不认识卡塞尔先生
<27-7,BECKETT>If you don't know Mr. Castle,

672
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,150
<27-7,BECKETT>那怎么会在海中央
<27-7,BECKETT>then how did he end up in this boat

673
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:53,250
<27-7,BECKETT>发现在他这条船上
<27-7,BECKETT>in the middle of the ocean?

674
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:54,920
<27-8,JENKINS>我不知道
<27-8,JENKINS>I have no idea,

675
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,620
<27-8,JENKINS>但我前几天来的时候
<27-8,JENKINS>but I did notice that it was missing

676
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,210
<27-8,JENKINS>确实注意到船不见了
<27-8,JENKINS>when I came up here a few days ago.

677
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:01,130
<27-9,ESPOSITO>你的船不见了  但是你却没有上报
<27-9,ESPOSITO>So your boat was missing, but you didn't report that?

678
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:02,320
<27-10,JENKINS>我从来不用那破玩意儿
<27-10,JENKINS>I never use the damn thing.

679
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:04,100
<27-10,JENKINS>我是说  我甚至不知道为什么买它
<27-10,JENKINS>I mean, I don't -- I don't even know why I bought it.

680
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:07,950
<27-10,JENKINS>我以为是船被解缆了  或者被偷了
<27-10,JENKINS>I just figured it came unmoored or -- or got stolen.

681
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:09,350
<27-11,RYAN>谁会偷小艇
<27-11,RYAN>Who would steal a dinghy?

682
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:14,230
<27-12,JENKINS>有个男的在沙滩旁转悠
<27-12,JENKINS>Well, there was a man who hanging around down by the beach.

683
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:14,770
<27-13,BECKETT>一个男的
<27-13,BECKETT>A man?

684
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,870
<27-13,BECKETT>形容一下他
<27-13,BECKETT>Describe him.

685
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,110
<27-14,JENKINS>快40了  个挺高
<27-14,JENKINS>Um, late 30s, I would guess, uh, tall,

686
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:22,590
<27-14,JENKINS>棕色头发  人高马大的
<27-14,JENKINS>brown hair, big build.

<27-14,JENKINS>对  就是他
<27-14,JENKINS>Yeah. Yeah, th-that's definitely him.

688
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:30,620
<27-15,BECKETT>他去过沙滩  他在那做什么
<27-15,BECKETT>He was on the beach? What was he doing?

689
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:31,350
<27-16,JENKINS>露营
<27-16,JENKINS>Camping.

690
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,140
<27-16,JENKINS>露营
<27-16,JENKINS>Camping?

691
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:35,020
<27-18,RYAN>-这不可能  -在一个帐篷里
<27-18,RYAN>-That can't be right. -In a tent.

692
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:36,550
<27-19,JENKINS>他看起来忙着干自己的事
<27-19,JENKINS>He was seemed to be minding his own business,

693
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,780
<27-19,JENKINS>况且是在国有土地  所以我就没管他
<27-19,JENKINS>and it was on state land, so I just left him alone.

694
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,010
<27-20,BECKETT>莱恩  你来完成詹金斯先生的笔录
<27-20,BECKETT>Ryan, can you finish taking Mr. Jenkins' statement?

695
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:46,680
<27-21,BECKETT>那男的住在哪
<27-21,BECKETT>Where exactly was this man?

696
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,030
<28-1,ESPOSITO>这里就是栓那艘小艇的船坞
<28-1,ESPOSITO>That's the dock - where the dinghy was tied up.

697
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:13,890
<28-2,BECKETT>这是卡塞尔的鞋子
<28-2,BECKETT>These are castle's shoes.

698
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:26,140
<28-3,BECKETT>这是他的手表
<28-3,BECKETT>This is his watch.

699
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:28,940
<28-4,ESPOSITO>报纸
<28-4,ESPOSITO>Newspapers.

700
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:31,560
<28-4,ESPOSITO>两个月前的报纸了
<28-4,ESPOSITO>Dating back two months.

701
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:34,930
<28-4,ESPOSITO>衣服  物资  他在这设备齐全了
<28-4,ESPOSITO>Clothes, supplies -- he has everything here.

702
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:37,360
<28-4,ESPOSITO>他完全可以走到那辆拖车
<28-4,ESPOSITO>He could've walked up to that trailer

703
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,540
<28-4,ESPOSITO>打个电话
<28-4,ESPOSITO>and made a phone call.

704
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,040
<28-4,ESPOSITO>但他没有
<28-4,ESPOSITO>But never did.

705
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,010
<28-5,ESPOSITO>怎么了
<28-5,ESPOSITO>What?

706
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:56,880
<28-6,ESPOSITO>卡塞尔的结婚礼服
<28-6,ESPOSITO>Castle's wedding tux?

707
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,630
<28-7,BECKETT>卡塞尔醒了
<28-7,BECKETT>Castle's awake.

708
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:10,020
<29-1,MARTHA>真是个好消息
<29-1,MARTHA>It's wonderful news --

709
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,580
<29-1,MARTHA>医生刚刚告诉我
<29-1,MARTHA>The doctor just told me

710
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:14,020
<29-1,MARTHA>理查德将完全康复
<29-1,MARTHA>Richard will make a full recovery.

711
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:17,110
<29-1,MARTHA>我真是松了一口气
<29-1,MARTHA>Oh, oh! I am so relieved!

712
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,410
<29-1,MARTHA>我当时在场
<29-1,MARTHA>Oh. And I was right there

713
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:21,230
<29-1,MARTHA>理查德醒来的时候
<29-1,MARTHA>when richard started to wake up.

714
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:22,550
<29-1,MARTHA>他做的第一件事
<29-1,MARTHA>First thing he did

715
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,790
<29-1,MARTHA>就是找你
<29-1,MARTHA>was ask for you.

716
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:25,960
<29-2,BECKETT>他说了他到哪儿去了吗
<29-2,BECKETT>Did he say where he had been?

717
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,520
<29-3,MARTHA>我们不知道他经历了什么
<29-3,MARTHA>You know, we don't know what he's been through,

718
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:31,680
<29-3,MARTHA>或许这问题可以迟些再问
<29-3,MARTHA>so perhaps that question can wait.

719
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:47,560
<30-2,BECKETT>告诉你件事
<30-2,BECKETT>Just so you know,

720
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:50,550
<30-3,CASTLE>医生说接吻可以加速身体康复
<30-3,CASTLE>the doctor said that kissing will speed my recovery.

721
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:53,820
<30-4,BECKETT>接吻待会再说  卡塞尔
<30-4,BECKETT>Kissing can wait, Castle.

722
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:56,730
<30-5,CASTLE>好的  抱歉
<30-5,CASTLE>Right. Sorry.

723
00:31:56,730 --> 00:31:59,810
<30-5,CASTLE>我想我让我们的婚礼计划打了结
<30-5,CASTLE>I guess I put a little kink in our wedding plans.

724
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:04,120
<30-6,BECKETT>你这是在开玩笑吗
<30-6,BECKETT>Yeah, is that supposed to be a joke?

725
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:05,800
<30-7,CASTLE>什么意思
<30-7,CASTLE>What do you mean?

726
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:07,740
<30-8,BECKETT>我的意思是告诉我发生了什么
<30-8,BECKETT>I mean tell me what happened.

727
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,710
<30-9,CASTLE>我在去参加婚礼的路上
<30-9,CASTLE>Was on my way to the wedding,

728
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,540
<30-9,CASTLE>有辆黑色的越野车
<30-9,CASTLE>and this black SUV --

729
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:14,730
<30-10,BECKETT>不  不是  这件事之后
<30-10,BECKETT>No, no. After that.

730
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,190
<30-11,CASTLE>车祸后的事吗
<30-11,CASTLE>After the accident?

731
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:17,990
<30-12,BECKETT>是的  车祸后的事
<30-12,BECKETT>Yes, after the accident.

732
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:19,500
<30-13,CASTLE>我就在这了
<30-13,CASTLE>I was here.

733
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,760
<30-14,BECKETT>不是  在这之前  卡塞尔
<30-14,BECKETT>No, before here, Castle.

734
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:23,910
<30-14,BECKETT>你在海上的一艘船里被找到
<30-14,BECKETT>You were found in a boat at sea --

735
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:25,690
<30-14,BECKETT>一艘看似是你偷来的船
<30-14,BECKETT>A boat - that you apparently stole?

736
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,690
<30-15,CASTLE>你到底在说什么
<30-15,CASTLE>What are you talking about?

737
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:29,590
<30-15,CASTLE>一艘  不  我出车祸了
<30-15,CASTLE>A bo-- no, I was in a crash

738
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:33,300
<30-15,CASTLE>和一辆黑色越野车相撞  之后就在这醒了
<30-15,CASTLE>with a black SUV, - a-and then I woke up here.

739
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,150
<30-16,BECKETT>不  告诉我在这其间发生了什么
<30-16,BECKETT>No, tell me what happened in between.

740
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:35,990
<30-16,BECKETT>什么也没有
<30-16,BECKETT>Nothing.

741
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:37,570
<30-17,CASTLE>我是说  我  我不知道
<30-17,CASTLE>I mean, I-I don't -- I don't know.

742
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:39,420
<30-17,CASTLE>我一直昏迷不醒
<30-17,CASTLE>I was -- I was unconscious.

743
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:45,490
<30-18,BECKETT>就是说黑色SUV和在医院醒过来
<30-18,BECKETT>So the black SUV and waking up here,

744
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:46,910
<30-18,BECKETT>你只记得这些了
<30-18,BECKETT>that's all you remember?

745
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:48,820
<30-19,CASTLE>是的  没错  干嘛这么问
<30-19,CASTLE>Right. Yes. Why?

746
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:52,780
<30-20,BECKETT>你已经失踪两个月了
<30-20,BECKETT>You've been missing for two months.

747
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,400
<31-1,BECKETT>你认为他这是怎么回事
<31-1,BECKETT>What do you think is going on with him?

748
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,070
<31-1,BECKETT>没有迹象显示卡塞尔先生有精神问题
<31-1,BECKETT>Well, Mr. Castle shows no sign of a psychosis

749
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:05,500
<31-1,BECKETT>或者现实感丧失
<31-1,BECKETT>or break with reality,

750
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,550
<31-2,BECKETT>也没有表现出认知障碍的迹象
<31-2,BECKETT>nor does he exhibit cognitive deficits

751
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:09,940
<31-2,BECKETT>除了他没办法回忆过去两个月发生的事情
<31-2,BECKETT>other than his inability to recall the last two months.

752
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:11,840
<31-2,BECKETT>也就是说可能是他遭遇过创伤
<31-2,BECKETT>So is it possible that he underwent trauma,

753
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,130
<31-2,BECKETT>封闭了这些记忆
<31-2,BECKETT>and he's blocking it out?

754
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,250
<31-2,BECKETT>有可能
<31-2,BECKETT>He may have,

755
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:16,130
<31-3,ALEXIS>虽然我没看到任何这方面的证据
<31-3,ALEXIS>although I didn't see any evidence of that.

756
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:17,600
<31-3,ALEXIS>也许他会恢复记忆
<31-3,ALEXIS>Maybe his memory will come back

757
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,490
<31-3,ALEXIS>只要给他时间去重新适应
<31-3,ALEXIS>once he's had some time to readjust.

758
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,580
<31-5,MARTHA>很有可能
<31-5,MARTHA>It very well might.

759
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:24,000
<31-4,MARTHA>那他需要的可能就是回归正常生活
<31-4,MARTHA>Then what he needs, maybe, is to get back to his life,

760
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,700
<31-4,MARTHA>他的日常工作  以及爱他的人
<31-4,MARTHA>his routine, the people who love him.

761
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,100
<31-4,MARTHA>我们能接他回家吗
<31-4,MARTHA>Can't we just take him home?

762
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,010
<31-4,MARTHA>你们得问他的医生
<31-4,MARTHA>You'll have to speak with his doctors.

763
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:31,840
<31-5,MARTHA>当然了  太感谢了
<31-5,MARTHA>Of course, of course. Oh, thank you so much.

764
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:33,810
<31-6,BECKETT>斯旺医生
<31-6,BECKETT>Dr. Swann...

765
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,090
<31-6,BECKETT>你觉得真正的原因是什么
<31-6,BECKETT>What do you think - is really behind all of this?

766
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:40,760
<31-6,BECKETT>我的工作并不是严谨科学  虽然我希望是
<31-6,BECKETT>What I do is not an exact science. I wish it were.

767
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,880
<31-6,BECKETT>失忆可能是情绪创伤导致的
<31-6,BECKETT>This could still be the result of emotional trauma.

768
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,880
<31-7,BECKETT>还有药物原因
<31-7,BECKETT>There are also drugs

769
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,650
<31-7,BECKETT>药物相互作用可以导致失忆
<31-7,BECKETT>and drug interactions - that can trigger memory loss,

770
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:48,470
<31-7,BECKETT>但是
<31-7,BECKETT>but...

771
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:49,650
<31-7,BECKETT>但是什么
<31-7,BECKETT>But what?

772
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:52,380
<31-7,BECKETT>我不能排除这种可能性
<31-7,BECKETT>...I can't exclude the possibility

773
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,790
<31-7,BECKETT>卡塞尔先生只是出于某种原因
<31-7,BECKETT>that mr. Castle simply walked away from his life,

774
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:56,000
<31-8,BECKETT>逃离生活
<31-8,BECKETT>for whatever reason,

775
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,920
<31-8,BECKETT>面对这一事实  对他来说太可耻
<31-8,BECKETT>and facing that fact - is just too humiliating for him.

776
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:02,300
<31-8,BECKETT>你觉得他可能假装失忆
<31-8,BECKETT>So you think that he could be pretending not to remember?

777
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,080
<31-8,BECKETT>我说过了  有可能
<31-8,BECKETT>As I said, it's a possibility.

778
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:20,790
<32-1,CASTLE>说我欠你一个道歉似乎完全不够
<32-1,CASTLE>To say I owe you an apology seems an understatement.

779
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:24,490
<32-2,BECKETT>我不要道歉  卡塞尔  我要弄清楚
<32-2,BECKETT>I don't want an apology, Castle. I just want to understand.

780
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:26,630
<32-3,CASTLE>你了解我的  凯特
<32-3,CASTLE>Well, you know me, Kate.

781
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,480
<32-3,CASTLE>我不会一走了之
<32-3,CASTLE>I wouldn't just leave.

782
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:30,090
<32-4,BECKETT>有证据
<32-4,BECKETT>There's evidence.

783
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:31,910
<32-4,BECKETT>我们找到了你待的地方
<32-4,BECKETT>We found the place where you were staying.

784
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:33,610
<32-5,CASTLE>哪里
<32-5,CASTLE>Where?

785
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:34,670
<32-6,BECKETT>知道又有什么区别
<32-6,BECKETT>What difference does it make?

786
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:38,000
<32-7,CASTLE>我想去那里  也许能帮我恢复记忆
<32-7,CASTLE>Because I want to go there. Maybe it'll help me remember.

787
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,100
<32-7,CASTLE>无论发生了什么  我需要答案
<32-7,CASTLE>Whatever happens, I need answers.

788
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,790
<32-7,CASTLE>你也一样
<32-7,CASTLE>And so do you.

789
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:47,800
<33-1,RYAN>我不明白
<33-1,RYAN>I don't get it.

790
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:51,610
<33-1,RYAN>卡塞尔怎么会离开  去露营
<33-1,RYAN>How could Castle - just leave and go...Camping?

791
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:53,530
<33-2,ESPOSITO>你不是要选择相信他吗
<33-2,ESPOSITO>What happened to giving him the benefit of the doubt?

792
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:55,360
<33-3,RYAN>贝克特叫我让鉴证组
<33-3,RYAN>Beckett asked me to have CSU take a look

793
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:56,750
<33-3,RYAN>检查帐篷内的东西
<33-3,RYAN>at the contents of the tent.

794
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:58,940
<33-3,RYAN>哈维  你是对的
<33-3,RYAN>Javi, you were right.

795
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:02,530
<33-3,RYAN>报纸上全是卡塞尔的指纹
<33-3,RYAN>Castle's fingerprints - were all over the newspaper,

796
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:05,240
<33-3,RYAN>帐篷里全是他的毛发  DNA
<33-3,RYAN>All his stuff -- hair, DNA.

797
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:08,880
<33-3,RYAN>我没办法解释
<33-3,RYAN>I can't explain that away.

798
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:11,810
<33-3,RYAN>这次真没办法
<33-3,RYAN>Not this time.

799
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:17,920
<34-1,CASTLE>有点让我想起  汉普顿或是缅因州
<34-1,CASTLE>Kind of reminds me - of the Hamptons or Maine,

800
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,280
<34-1,CASTLE>但我肯定我没来过这里
<34-1,CASTLE>but I'm pretty sure I've never been here.

801
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,000
<34-2,BECKETT>就是这里
<34-2,BECKETT>Okay, this is it.

802
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,350
<34-2,BECKETT>你的帐篷就在这里
<34-2,BECKETT>This is where your tent was.

803
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:28,790
<34-3,CASTLE>这里一切看起来都不熟悉
<34-3,CASTLE>No, none of this looks familiar.

804
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,870
<34-4,BECKETT>卡塞尔  告诉我真相
<34-4,BECKETT>Castle, just tell me the truth.

805
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:35,090
<34-4,BECKETT>这是你欠我的
<34-4,BECKETT>You owe me that much.

806
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:38,010
<34-5,CASTLE>我是在告诉你真相  我没来过这里
<34-5,CASTLE>I am telling you the truth. I was not here.

807
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:39,570
<34-6,BECKETT>你的衣服在这里
<34-6,BECKETT>Well, your clothes were here.

808
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:42,510
<34-6,BECKETT>你的表  你的礼服
<34-6,BECKETT>Your watch was here, your tuxedo...

809
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:46,420
<34-6,BECKETT>你娶我时要穿的那套
<34-6,BECKETT>The one that you were gonna wear when you married me.

810
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:52,930
<34-7,CASTLE>肯定是布的局  和...
<34-7,CASTLE>It must've been planted here, you know, along with --

811
00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:55,140
<34-8,BECKETT>没什么布局  卡塞尔  你曾经在这里
<34-8,BECKETT>Nothing was planted, Castle. It was you.

812
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:57,620
<34-8,BECKETT>-有你的DNA和指纹  -化验室肯定搞错了
<34-8,BECKETT>- It was your DNA, your prints. - Must've been a mistake at the lab.

813
00:35:57,620 --> 00:36:00,270
<34-9,CASTLE>-有许多案件...  -我相信你
<34-9,CASTLE>- There have been numerous cases -- - I believed in you. I...

814
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:03,070
<34-10,BECKETT>我说服自己  证据并不重要
<34-10,BECKETT>I convinced myself - that the evidence didn't matter,

815
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:05,030
<34-10,BECKETT>这一切太明显
<34-10,BECKETT>that everything that seemed so obvious

816
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:06,520
<34-10,BECKETT>不可能是真的
<34-10,BECKETT>couldn't possibly be true.

817
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:08,590
<34-10,BECKETT>我到处搜寻你
<34-10,BECKETT>I was searching for you.

818
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:10,650
<34-10,BECKETT>我甚至不知道你是生还是死
<34-10,BECKETT>I didn't even know if you were alive or if you were dead,

819
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:12,920
<34-10,BECKETT>你却在这里  待在你想待的地方
<34-10,BECKETT>And you were right here, right where you wanted to be.

820
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,390
<34-11,CASTLE>我向你发誓
<34-11,CASTLE>I promise you...

821
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,130
<34-11,CASTLE>我没有在这里搭帐篷
<34-11,CASTLE>I did not pitch a tent here.

822
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:19,250
<34-11,CASTLE>我不可能
<34-11,CASTLE>I could not have.

823
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:21,140
<34-12,BECKETT>我亲眼见到的  卡塞尔
<34-12,BECKETT>I saw it for myself, Castle.

824
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:23,520
<34-13,CASTLE>我永远不可能在这个地方搭帐篷
<34-13,CASTLE>I would never camp in this spot,

825
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,720
<34-13,CASTLE>在我为《热带斯道姆》做调研后绝对不会
<34-13,CASTLE>Not after the research I did on "Tropical Storm."

826
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:28,030
<34-14,BECKETT>我根本没办法和你沟通了
<34-14,BECKETT>I can't even do this with you.

827
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,390
<34-15,CASTLE>等等  听我说
<34-15,CASTLE>Hey, wait. Listen.

828
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:32,690
<34-16,BECKETT>你从来没写过名为《热带斯道姆》的书  卡塞尔
<34-16,BECKETT>You never wrote a book called "Tropical storm," Castle.

829
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:33,970
<34-17,CASTLE>凯特  等等
<34-17,CASTLE>Kate, wait.

830
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:36,080
<34-17,CASTLE>听我说
<34-17,CASTLE>Listen.

831
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,860
<34-18,CASTLE>我开始写了  后来放弃了
<34-18,CASTLE>I started the book. I threw it out.

832
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:42,250
<34-18,CASTLE>本来写的是超级恶人控制天气
<34-18,CASTLE>It was, uh -- super-villain controls the weather.

833
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:44,520
<34-18,CASTLE>很可怕
<34-18,CASTLE>It was terrible, but it --

834
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:47,230
<34-18,CASTLE>但我对灾难性暴风雨的研究
<34-18,CASTLE>The research I did on catastrophic storms --

835
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:49,530
<34-18,CASTLE>让我挥之不去  让我从此
<34-18,CASTLE>It stuck with me, leaving me with

836
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:53,630
<34-18,CASTLE>对海啸有了不合理但是无法抵抗的恐惧
<34-18,CASTLE>an irrational but overpowering fear of tsunamis.

837
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:56,010
<34-19,BECKETT>你在汉普顿买了海边别墅
<34-19,BECKETT>You bought a beach house in the Hamptons.

838
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:58,570
<34-20,CASTLE>靠内陆  不是海边
<34-20,CASTLE>Yeah, on the inland side, not on the ocean side.

839
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:00,340
<34-20,CASTLE>凯特
<34-20,CASTLE>Kate...

840
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:03,490
<34-21,CASTLE>我不会在这里露营的  我会选高一点的地方
<34-21,CASTLE>I would never camp here. I would go for higher ground.

841
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:05,450
<34-21,CASTLE>卡塞尔
<34-21,CASTLE>Castle...

842
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:07,850
<34-22,BECKETT>有证人
<34-22,BECKETT>There was a witness.

843
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:09,770
<34-23,CASTLE>什么证人
<34-23,CASTLE>What witness?

844
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:15,800
<35-1,MAN>有什么事
<35-1,MAN>Can I help you?

845
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:17,130
<35-2,BECKETT>纽约警局
<35-2,BECKETT>Yeah. NYPD.

846
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,380
<35-2,BECKETT>我来找亨利·詹金斯
<35-2,BECKETT>I'm here to see Henry Jenkins?

847
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,210
<35-3,MAN>我是亨利·詹金斯
<35-3,MAN>I'm Henry Jenkins.

848
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:24,160
<35-4,BECKETT>不好意思  我昨天来过了
<35-4,BECKETT>I'm sorry. I was here yesterday,

849
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,680
<35-4,BECKETT>我见到的是另一个亨利·詹金斯
<35-4,BECKETT>and I met a different Henry Jenkins.

850
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:27,560
<35-2,BECKETT>什么意思
<35-2,BECKETT>What do you mean?

851
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:28,840
<35-3,MAN>我是亨利·詹金斯
<35-3,MAN>I'm Henry Jenkins,

852
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:30,390
<35-5,MAN>而且我好几个月没来过这了
<35-5,MAN>and I haven't been here in months.

853
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,060
<36-1,BECKETT>我们查了指纹和护照
<36-1,BECKETT>We ran prints and passport.

854
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:38,470
<36-1,BECKETT>他绝对是货真价实的亨利·詹金斯
<36-1,BECKETT>He is definitely the real Henry Jenkins.

855
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:41,350
<36-2,CASTLE>也就是说第一个人是假詹金斯
<36-2,CASTLE>Which means the first guy was a fake Jenkins --

856
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:42,260
<36-2,CASTLE>还是个骗子
<36-2,CASTLE>also, a liar.

857
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,760
<36-3,ESPOSITO>但他跟车管所备案的照片匹配啊
<36-3,ESPOSITO>But he matched the DMV photo.

858
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,210
<36-4,CASTLE>那是因为车管所的照片被掉包了
<36-4,CASTLE>That's because his photo got switched.

859
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:47,210
<36-4,CASTLE>我们打电话给车管所时  他们发现自己的系统
<36-4,CASTLE>When we called the DMV, they realized their system

860
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:48,490
<36-4,CASTLE>在两天前被黑了
<36-4,CASTLE>had been hacked two days ago,

861
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:50,250
<36-4,CASTLE>正是新闻报道说我被找到的时候
<36-4,CASTLE>right after the news broke that I'd been found.

862
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,440
<36-5,RYAN>那帐篷里你的那些东西呢
<36-5,RYAN>What about all your stuff in the tent?

863
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,080
<36-6,BECKETT>看来那些东西
<36-6,BECKETT>Well, it looks like

864
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,770
<36-6,BECKETT>都是被设计好的  为了留下假线索
<36-6,BECKETT>it was all set up in order to create a false trail.

865
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,520
<36-7,ESPOSITO>那你为什么失忆呢
<36-7,ESPOSITO>So why don't you remember anything?

866
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,000
<36-8,CASTLE>这些人试图让整件事看起来
<36-8,CASTLE>Uh, these people have managed to make it look

867
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,270
<36-8,CASTLE>像是我筹划绑架了自己
<36-8,CASTLE>as though I staged my own abduction.

868
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:03,370
<36-8,CASTLE>他们黑了车管所系统
<36-8,CASTLE>They hacked the DMV.

869
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:05,120
<36-8,CASTLE>弄了个假詹金斯出来
<36-8,CASTLE>They provided a false Jenkins

870
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,820
<36-8,CASTLE>把你们引向预先准备好的证据
<36-8,CASTLE>who pointed you to doctored evidence

871
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,390
<36-8,CASTLE>让你们以为我去露营了
<36-8,CASTLE>that I'd gone camping.

872
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,610
<36-8,CASTLE>不管这些是什么人  他们有无限的资源
<36-8,CASTLE>Whoever they are, they have unlimited resources,

873
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:13,720
<36-8,CASTLE>也许他们甚至有
<36-8,CASTLE>maybe the kind of resources that would allow them

874
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,480
<36-8,CASTLE>可以改变别人记忆的资源
<36-8,CASTLE>to alter someone's memory.

875
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,540
<36-9,ESPOSITO>那笔钱又怎么解释呢
<36-9,ESPOSITO>What about the money?

876
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:18,670
<36-10,CASTLE>什么钱
<36-10,CASTLE>What money?

877
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:19,890
<36-11,ESPOSITO>监控录像拍到你在被绑架后
<36-11,ESPOSITO>We have you on video dropping off

878
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:23,160
<36-11,ESPOSITO>还曾把一万美金丢在了指定的垃圾桶里
<36-11,ESPOSITO>$10,000 in a dumpster after you were taken.

879
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:26,930
<36-12,CASTLE>我现在还无法解释那件事
<36-12,CASTLE>Yeah, I can't explain the money yet.

880
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:28,970
<36-12,CASTLE>但我早晚会的
<36-12,CASTLE>But I will.

881
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:31,110
<36-12,CASTLE>假詹金斯参与其中
<36-12,CASTLE>And fake Jenkins was part of the setup.

882
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,190
<36-12,CASTLE>所以不管他是谁
<36-12,CASTLE>So whoever he is,

883
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:34,940
<36-12,CASTLE>他都跟这件事脱不了干系
<36-12,CASTLE>he's somehow in the middle of this.

884
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:42,680
<37-1,MARTHA>好了  亲爱的
<37-1,MARTHA>Here you go, darling.

885
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,510
<37-2,CASTLE>谢谢  妈妈  请允许我引用
<37-2,CASTLE>Thank you, mother, and let me just say,

886
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:46,220
<37-2,CASTLE>桃乐茜[《绿野仙踪》女主]的不朽名言
<37-2,CASTLE>in the immortal words of Dorothy,

887
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:47,550
<37-2,CASTLE>"无处如家"
<37-2,CASTLE>"There's no place like home."

888
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,990
<37-2,CASTLE>我不明白的是
<37-2,CASTLE>Here's what I don't get.

889
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:53,400
<37-3,ALEXIS>为什么会有人如此对你呢  爸
<37-3,ALEXIS>Why would someone do this to you, dad?

890
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:55,610
<37-3,ALEXIS>你这两个月到底跑哪去了
<37-3,ALEXIS>Where did you actually go for two months?

891
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:56,560
<37-4,CASTLE>那些答案都藏在
<37-4,CASTLE>Well, those answers lie

892
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,960
<37-4,CASTLE>其背后巨大狡猾的阴谋中
<37-4,CASTLE>within the vast and insidious conspiracy behind all this,

893
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:03,060
<37-4,CASTLE>我下定决心要解开这张
<37-4,CASTLE>a tangled web that I fully intend to...

894
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:04,510
<37-4,CASTLE>错综复杂的迷网
<37-4,CASTLE>untangle.

895
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:05,660
<37-5,MARTHA>别再说这件事了
<37-5,MARTHA>Enough of that.

896
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:07,360
<37-5,MARTHA>我想敬个酒
<37-5,MARTHA>I'd like to propose a toast.

897
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:09,190
<37-5,MARTHA>敬平安回家
<37-5,MARTHA>To safe returns.

898
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:10,750
<37-6,ALEXIS>还要敬再不分离
<37-6,ALEXIS>And no more departures.

899
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,440
<37-7,CASTLE>还要敬我伟大的母亲
<37-7,CASTLE>And to my amazing mother...

900
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:14,620
<37-7,CASTLE>聪慧的女儿
<37-7,CASTLE>my wonderful daughter...

901
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,410
<37-7,CASTLE>和我一生的挚爱
<37-7,CASTLE>and the love of my life.

902
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:19,390
<37-8,BECKETT>敬回家
<37-8,BECKETT>And to coming home.

903
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,670
<38-1,BECKETT>我们会搞清楚到底发生了什么
<38-1,BECKETT>We'll find out what happened.

904
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:30,880
<38-1,BECKETT>我知道
<38-1,BECKETT>I know.

905
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:33,290
<38-2,CASTLE>我只是在想
<38-2,CASTLE>I was just thinking...

906
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,950
<38-2,CASTLE>我觉得好像昨天还戴过这块表
<38-2,CASTLE>I feel like I just wore this yesterday,

907
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:40,310
<38-2,CASTLE>昨晚还和你一起睡在这张床上
<38-2,CASTLE>that we slept in this bed last night.

908
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:43,360
<38-2,CASTLE>对你来说  这肯定是恍如隔世了
<38-2,CASTLE>For you, it must seem like a lifetime ago.

909
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,550
<38-3,BECKETT>是  没错
<38-3,BECKETT>Yeah, it does.

910
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:48,270
<38-4,CASTLE>你是怎么做到不放弃希望的呢
<38-4,CASTLE>How did you not lose hope?

911
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:50,440
<38-5,BECKETT>我失去过希望  你知道吗
<38-5,BECKETT>I did lose hope, you know?

912
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,270
<38-5,BECKETT>但是我
<38-5,BECKETT>But I...

913
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:53,630
<38-5,BECKETT>我还是会把它找回来
<38-5,BECKETT>I would get it back.

914
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:57,270
<38-5,BECKETT>我为了保持希望而想出了很多仪式
<38-5,BECKETT>Developed rituals in order to hang on to it.

915
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:58,640
<38-6,CASTLE>什么仪式
<38-6,CASTLE>Like what?

916
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:02,440
<38-7,BECKETT>很傻的  不说也罢
<38-7,BECKETT>It's...stupid. It really doesn't matter.

917
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,520
<38-8,CASTLE>不  我想听
<38-8,CASTLE>No, I'd like to know.

918
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:06,930
<38-9,BECKETT>我会一直盯着谋杀板上你的照片看
<38-9,BECKETT>I would stare at your photo on the murder board.

919
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:08,880
<38-9,BECKETT>我开始觉得
<38-9,BECKETT>And I started thinking

920
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,860
<38-9,BECKETT>只要我每天看的时间够长
<38-9,BECKETT>that if I would look at it long enough every day,

921
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:12,880
<38-9,BECKETT>你就能活着
<38-9,BECKETT>that that would keep you alive.

922
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:16,600
<38-10,CASTLE>看来管用了
<38-10,CASTLE>I guess it worked.

923
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:18,280
<38-11,BECKETT>还有你的椅子
<38-11,BECKETT>And then I had this thing about your chair.

924
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:20,240
<38-12,CASTLE>我在分局的椅子吗
<38-12,CASTLE>My chair at the precinct?

925
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:21,910
<38-13,BECKETT>我不让任何人碰它
<38-13,BECKETT>I wouldn't let anyone touch it.

00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:23,590
<38-13,BECKETT>有天晚上清洁工来打扫
<38-13,BECKETT>And then a night janitor came by.

927
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:26,300
<38-13,BECKETT>他想挪开椅子  我就疯了  我
<38-13,BECKETT>He tried to move the chair, and I freaked out, and I...

928
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:28,200
<38-13,BECKETT>我差点开枪毙了他
<38-13,BECKETT>almost shot him.

929
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,980
<38-14,CASTLE>我很抱歉
<38-14,CASTLE>I am so sorry...

930
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:49,350
<38-14,CASTLE>让你受了这么多罪
<38-14,CASTLE>for everything I put you through.

931
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,020
<38-15,BECKETT>这不是你的错
<38-15,BECKETT>It's not your fault, you know.

932
00:40:57,470 --> 00:40:59,040
<38-15,BECKETT>你也受了很多罪  所以
<38-15,BECKETT>You went through stuff, too, so...

933
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:00,190
<38-16,CASTLE>这不一样
<38-16,CASTLE>Well, it's not the same.

934
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:01,490
<38-16,CASTLE>我不记得了
<38-16,CASTLE>I can't remember.

935
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:05,230
<38-16,CASTLE>虽然我确定地知道我肯定很想你
<38-16,CASTLE>Though I do know I missed you terribly,

936
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,520
<38-16,CASTLE>因为我不可能不想你
<38-16,CASTLE>because there's no way I wouldn't.

937
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:15,570
<38-17,CASTLE>我们不能
<38-17,CASTLE>We can't just, um...

938
00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:19,450
<38-17,CASTLE>接着之前的日子过  就好像
<38-17,CASTLE>pick up where we left off, can we,

939
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:20,700
<38-17,CASTLE>这一切都没发生过  对吧
<38-17,CASTLE>as if nothing happened?

940
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:22,270
<38-18,BECKETT>不行
<38-18,BECKETT>No.

941
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:28,310
<38-19,CASTLE>会过去的
<38-19,CASTLE>We'll get there.

942
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:31,280
<38-19,CASTLE>我们会找到回家的路
<38-19,CASTLE>We'll find our way home.
