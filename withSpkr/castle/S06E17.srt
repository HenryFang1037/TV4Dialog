1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,870
<1-1,KATE BECKETT>这是天堂
<1-1,KATE BECKETT>This is heaven.

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:05,690
<1-1,KATE BECKETT>真是天堂啊
<1-1,KATE BECKETT>This is absolute heaven.

3
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:08,370
<1-2,RICHARD CASTLE>你是说跟你未来老公共度一天吗
<1-2,RICHARD CASTLE>Yeah, you mean spending the day with your future husband?

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:09,880
<1-3,BECKETT>不  不是啦
<1-3,BECKETT>No, no. Not that.

5
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:11,450
<1-4,CASTLE>不是
<1-4,CASTLE>Not that?

6
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:13,400
<1-5,BECKETT>不不  不止是这样
<1-5,BECKETT>No, no, no. I mean, not only that.

7
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:14,570
<1-5,BECKETT>都下午两点了
<1-5,BECKETT>It's 2:00.

8
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:15,810
<1-5,BECKETT>我还穿着睡衣
<1-5,BECKETT>I'm in my P.J.S.

9
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:17,260
<1-5,BECKETT>我们在看报纸
<1-5,BECKETT>We're reading the newspapers.

10
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,690
<1-5,BECKETT>我从没机会这样做
<1-5,BECKETT>I never get to do this.

11
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:20,240
<1-6,CASTLE>因为你从来不休假
<1-6,CASTLE>Because you never take any time off.

12
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,530
<1-7,BECKETT>我们只要无所事事就好
<1-7,BECKETT>All we have to do is loaf around.

13
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:25,000
<1-7,BECKETT>不用干活儿  只要一直浪费时间
<1-7,BECKETT>There's no work, no goals other than to waste hours on end.

14
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,700
<1-8,CASTLE>好了  别描述我的生活了
<1-8,CASTLE>Okay. Stop describing my life.

15
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,840
<1-8,CASTLE>不过有件事我们今天得完成
<1-8,CASTLE>Though there is one thing we should get done today.

16
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,360
<1-8,CASTLE>我们得给喜帖挑一款字体
<1-8,CASTLE>We need to pick a font for our "save the date" cards.

17
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,240
<1-9,BECKETT>真的吗  真要做这事
<1-9,BECKETT>Really? We're gonna do that?

18
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:36,730
<1-9,BECKETT>我们连场地都没有呢
<1-9,BECKETT>We don't even have a venue yet.

19
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:39,540
<1-10,CASTLE>截止期限能  鞭策我
<1-10,CASTLE>Yeah. I find deadlines...inspiring.

20
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:40,600
<1-10,CASTLE>这个怎么样
<1-10,CASTLE>How about this one?

21
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,620
<1-11,BECKETT>不要  镶边太多
<1-11,BECKETT>No. It's too frilly.

22
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:43,410
<1-12,CASTLE>同意
<1-12,CASTLE>Agreed.

23
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:46,430
<1-12,CASTLE>这个  太严肃了
<1-12,CASTLE>And this -- ooh, this is...far too severe.

24
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:48,580
<1-12,CASTLE>好像在说  你立马就得给我空出时间来
<1-12,CASTLE>You will save the date now.

25
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,160
<1-13,BECKETT>我喜欢这个  你呢
<1-13,BECKETT>Oh, I like that one. You?

26
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:54,030
<1-14,CASTLE>没什么感觉
<1-14,CASTLE>Mm, I'm not really feeling it,

27
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,750
<1-14,CASTLE>不过你可以说服我
<1-14,CASTLE>though I guess, uh, you could convince me.

28
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:59,420
<1-15,BECKETT>我肯定可以
<1-15,BECKETT>I bet I could.

29
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:01,350
<1-16,CASTLE>你可得花一番工夫
<1-16,CASTLE>Yeah, I mean, you'd have to work pretty hard

32
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,090
<1-17,BECKETT>我正准备这么做呢
<1-17,BECKETT>Well, I'm prepared to do just that.

34
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:06,990
<1-17,BECKETT>因为我很清楚咱俩目前需要的
<1-17,BECKETT>Because it's clear to me that what we both need right now

35
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,990
<1-17,BECKETT>就是一款非常棒的字体
<1-17,BECKETT>is a really good font.

37
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:11,990
<1-18,CASTLE>是的  太对了
<1-18,CASTLE>Yes, we do. That's so true.

39
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,240
<1-19,CASTLE>史上最差时机
<1-19,CASTLE>And worst timing ever.

41
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,130
<1-21,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>警探  你多久能到警局
<1-21,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>Detective, how soon can you get here?

42
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:26,540
<1-22,BECKETT>长官  我今天不当班
<1-22,BECKETT>Uh, sir, I'm actually not on call today.

43
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,220
<1-23,GATES>我知道  但出了点事
<1-23,GATES>I'm aware of that, but something has come up,

44
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:29,710
<1-23,GATES>恐怕等不了
<1-23,GATES>and I'm afraid it can't wait.

45
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:31,330
<1-24,BECKETT>我二十分钟后能到
<1-24,BECKETT>Well, I can get there in 20 minutes.

46
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,680
<1-25,GATES>还有一件事  一个人来
<1-25,GATES>One more thing -- come alone.

47
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:36,740
<1-25,GATES>别带上卡塞尔先生
<1-25,GATES>Do not bring Mr. Castle.

48
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:38,650
<1-26,BECKETT>是  长官
<1-26,BECKETT>Uh...yes, sir.

49
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:41,120
<1-27,CASTLE>盖茨找你什么事
<1-27,CASTLE>So, what's Gates up to

50
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,270
<1-27,CASTLE>除了妨碍我们的家庭欢愉
<1-27,CASTLE>aside from sabotaging our domestic bliss?

51
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:44,280
<1-27,CASTLE>不知道
<1-27,CASTLE>I don't know.

52
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,640
<1-28,BECKETT>但我得走了
<1-28,BECKETT>But I got to go.

53
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,470
<1-29,CASTLE>我大概不能说服你...
<1-29,CASTLE>I don't suppose I could convince you to just --

54
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:48,590
<1-31,CASTLE>不能
<1-31,CASTLE>No.

55
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,120
<1-32,CASTLE>没关系  不要紧
<1-32,CASTLE>Yeah. Don't worry. It's fine.

56
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,230
<1-32,CASTLE>别担心  我没事
<1-32,CASTLE>Don't worry about it. I'm fine.

57
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,330
<1-32,CASTLE>我就  写写东西吧
<1-32,CASTLE>I'll just, uh -- I'll do some writing...

58
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:57,980
<1-32,CASTLE>如果我能  集中精神的话
<1-32,CASTLE>if I can... manage to focus.

59
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,020
<2-1,JAVIER ESPOSITO>贝克特  你不是休息呢吗
<2-1,JAVIER ESPOSITO>Yo, Beckett. I thought you were off.

60
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,320
<2-2,BECKETT>刚刚那是副局长吗
<2-2,BECKETT>Was that the deputy commissioner?

61
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,450
<2-3,ESPOSITO>是的  这儿的黄铜[高级警官]可比
<2-3,ESPOSITO>Yeah, there's been more brass through here

62
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,770
<2-3,ESPOSITO>-军乐队还多  -怎么回事
<2-3,ESPOSITO>- than a marching band. - What's going on?

63
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:09,650
<2-5,KEVIN RYAN>需者方知
<2-5,KEVIN RYAN>It's all need-to-know,

64
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:11,750
<2-5,KEVIN RYAN>-而咱俩不是  -但不管是怎么回事
<2-5,KEVIN RYAN>- and we didn't make the list. - But whatever's happening

65
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,250
<2-6,ESPOSITO>都在那间会议室讨论
<2-6,ESPOSITO>is going down in that conference room.

66
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:14,620
<2-7,GATES>警探
<2-7,GATES>Detective.

67
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:15,430
<2-7,GATES>-在  -在
<2-7,GATES>- Yep. - Yep.

68
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,190
<2-7,GATES>-贝克特  -不好意思
<2-7,GATES>- Beckett. - Sorry.

69
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,920
<3-1,GATES>贝克特探长
<3-1,GATES>Detective Beckett,

70
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:23,560
<3-1,GATES>缉毒队警监富勒
<3-1,GATES>Capton Fowler, head of narcotics.

71
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,140
<3-2,CAPTAIN FOWLER>谢谢你赶来  警探
<3-2,CAPTAIN FOWLER>Thank you for coming, detective.

72
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:29,270
<3-2,CAPTAIN FOWLER>我将要告诉你的事不能泄露
<3-2,CAPTAIN FOWLER>What I'm about to tell you cannot leave this room.

73
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,010
<3-3,BECKETT>明白  长官
<3-3,BECKETT>Yeah. Understood, sir.

74
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,540
<3-4,FOWLER>这六名死者被人割喉
<3-4,FOWLER>These six victims had their throats cut.

75
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:36,470
<3-4,FOWLER>他们都是中高等级的毒贩
<3-4,FOWLER>They were mid-to upper-level drug dealers.

76
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,800
<3-4,FOWLER>两名是青少年
<3-4,FOWLER>Two were teenagers.

77
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:39,560
<3-4,FOWLER>他们都在过去几个月内遇害
<3-4,FOWLER>They were all murdered in the past few months

78
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,930
<3-5,BECKETT>这期间出现了一个新贩毒集团
<3-5,BECKETT>when a new drug ring muscled in

79
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:43,670
<3-4,FOWLER>抢走了住宅区那片的海洛因和可卡因买卖
<3-4,FOWLER>and took over most of the uptown heroin and cocaine trade.

80
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,900
<3-5,BECKETT>新贩毒集团
<3-5,BECKETT>A new drug ring?

81
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:46,900
<3-5,BECKETT>是谁
<3-5,BECKETT>Well, who are they?

82
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,260
<3-6,FOWLER>局长让我查明究竟
<3-6,FOWLER>The commissioner asked me to find that out

83
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:51,360
<3-6,FOWLER>一举缴获他们  但他们隐藏很深
<3-6,FOWLER>and shut them down, but they're invisible, these guys.

84
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,700
<3-6,FOWLER>他们不用银行  所以我们无法追踪金钱
<3-6,FOWLER>They don't use banks, so we can't follow the money.

85
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:55,210
<3-6,FOWLER>他们不让街头毒贩
<3-6,FOWLER>They make sure their street dealers

86
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:56,580
<3-6,FOWLER>见到供货人
<3-6,FOWLER>never meet their suppliers.

87
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,650
<3-7,BECKETT>所以抓到一个毒贩
<3-7,BECKETT>So, when you bust a dealer,

88
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,130
<3-7,BECKETT>他也不知道自己为谁做事
<3-7,BECKETT>he doesn't know who he's working for.

89
00:02:59,130 --> 00:02:59,980
<3-8,FOWLER>正是
<3-8,FOWLER>Exactly.

90
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:02,140
<3-8,FOWLER>查了三个月  我们还是一无所获
<3-8,FOWLER>So, three months in, and we have nothing.

91
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,240
<3-8,FOWLER>除了拉兹拉斯  我们连一个名字都没查到
<3-8,FOWLER>We don't even know any of their names, except for Lazarus.

92
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,180
<3-9,BECKETT>-拉兹拉斯是谁  -他们的老大
<3-9,BECKETT>- And who is Lazarus? - The leader.

93
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,910
<3-9,BECKETT>当然不是真名
<3-9,BECKETT>Not his real name, of course.

94
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,590
<3-10,FOWLER>昨天  警方截取了一通电话
<3-10,FOWLER>Then yesterday, a phone intercept

95
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:15,510
<3-10,FOWLER>找到了这个女人  伊莲娜·马科夫
<3-10,FOWLER>led us to this woman -- Elena Markov.

96
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:18,300
<3-10,FOWLER>她坦白自己是那个集团中一个低级运毒人
<3-10,FOWLER>She copped to being a low-level drug courier in the ring.

97
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,780
<3-10,FOWLER>在俄罗斯出生  作为邮购新娘来了美国
<3-10,FOWLER>Born in Russia, she came here as a mail-order bride,

98
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,210
<3-10,FOWLER>跟丈夫离婚
<3-10,FOWLER>divorced her husband.

99
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:24,140
<3-10,FOWLER>英语说得比我们都好
<3-10,FOWLER>She learned to speak English better than we do

100
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,880
<3-10,FOWLER>靠做兼职翻译过活
<3-10,FOWLER>and was getting by as a freelance translator.

101
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,260
<3-10,FOWLER>她从没惹上过麻烦  直至今日
<3-10,FOWLER>She'd never been in trouble before, at least not till now.

102
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:34,810
<3-11,ELENA MARKOV>我在找工作  又听说了一条赚钱的门路
<3-11,ELENA MARKOV>I needed work, and I heard about a way to make money.

103
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:37,410
<3-11,ELENA MARKOV>只要打个电话就行  所以我做了
<3-11,ELENA MARKOV>All I had to do was call a number, so I did.

104
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:39,700
<3-11,ELENA MARKOV>一旦加入  就脱不了身了
<3-11,ELENA MARKOV>But once I got in, I couldn't get out.

105
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,900
<3-12,FOWLER>你在集团里的联系人是谁
<3-12,FOWLER>Who was your contact in the ring?

106
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,150
<3-13,ELENA>我没有联系人
<3-13,ELENA>I didn't have one.

107
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:45,460
<3-13,ELENA>我会收到一条写明时间地点的短信
<3-13,ELENA>I would get a text with a time and a place,

108
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,740
<3-13,ELENA>然后得到一个内藏纸条的包裹
<3-13,ELENA>and I'd get a package with a note hidden inside

109
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,350
<3-13,ELENA>上面会告诉我送到哪去
<3-13,ELENA>that would tell me where to take it.

110
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:51,380
<3-14,FOWLER>你见过谁吗
<3-14,FOWLER>Did you ever, um, see anyone?

111
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,920
<3-14,FOWLER>跟谁有过来往吗
<3-14,FOWLER>Did you ever interact with anyone?

112
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,660
<3-15,ELENA>没有  一切都是匿名的
<3-15,ELENA>No. Everything was anonymous.

113
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,470
<3-15,ELENA>我不了解他们  他们也不了解我
<3-15,ELENA>I don't know them. They don't know me.

114
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,540
<3-15,ELENA>应该一直是那样的
<3-15,ELENA>It -- it needs to stay that way.

115
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:02,930
<3-15,ELENA>我只想回到我以前的生活
<3-15,ELENA>Look, I-I just want to get my life back.

116
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,290
<3-16,FOWLER>线索看似是断了
<3-16,FOWLER>It looked like another dead end.

117
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:09,280
<3-16,FOWLER>结果今早  伊莲娜又收到贩毒集团的短信
<3-16,FOWLER>Then this morning, Elena got another text from the ring.

118
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,750
<3-16,FOWLER>这一回他们想见她  给她升职
<3-16,FOWLER>This time, they wanted to meet her to offer her a promotion.

119
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,430
<3-17,BECKETT>你们就有机会找出相关人员了
<3-17,BECKETT>Which would give you guys a chance to get eyes on someone.

120
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:17,160
<3-18,FOWLER>这是我们等待已久的突破口
<3-18,FOWLER>It's the break we've been waiting for.

121
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,280
<3-18,FOWLER>所以我们希望伊莲娜同意会面
<3-18,FOWLER>So, we leveraged Elena to take the meet,

122
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:20,800
<3-18,FOWLER>但她却想自杀
<3-18,FOWLER>but she tried to commit suicide.

123
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,300
<3-19,GATES>她现在在警方的严密监管下
<3-19,GATES>She's in intensive care under police guard.

124
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:25,760
<3-20,BECKETT>长官  很遗憾听到这些
<3-20,BECKETT>Sir, I'm sorry to hear about that,

125
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,970
<3-20,BECKETT>但这些跟我有什么关系
<3-20,BECKETT>but what does this all have to do with me?

126
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:31,770
<3-21,FOWLER>会面安排在今天五点
<3-21,FOWLER>The meeting is set for 5:00 today,

127
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:34,140
<3-21,FOWLER>而且不会再有第二次这种机会了
<3-21,FOWLER>and a chance like this is not gonna come back around,

128
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:38,060
<3-21,FOWLER>我们在纽约警察中筛选了跟伊莲娜年龄相仿
<3-21,FOWLER>so we combed the NYPD database for someone about Elena's age

129
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,040
<3-21,FOWLER>相貌相似  掌握流利俄语的人
<3-21,FOWLER>and appearance who speaks fluent Russian,

130
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:41,720
<3-21,FOWLER>以防万一
<3-21,FOWLER>in case that's relevant.

131
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:45,340
<3-21,FOWLER>只跳出了一个名字  那就是你
<3-21,FOWLER>Only one name came up -- yours.

132
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,740
<3-23,BECKETT>你要我代替她去会面
<3-23,BECKETT>You want me to go in her place?

133
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:49,250
<3-24,FOWLER>去韦德马克酒店
<3-24,FOWLER>To the Widmark.

134
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,580
<3-24,FOWLER>现个身  见见联络人  回来
<3-24,FOWLER>Show up, meet your contact, and leave.

135
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:52,580
<3-24,FOWLER>很快的
<3-24,FOWLER>In and out.

136
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,940
<3-25,BECKETT>如果他们发现你们替换了伊莲娜
<3-25,BECKETT>What if they found out that you turned Elena

137
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,470
<3-25,BECKETT>一切都是陷阱怎么办
<3-25,BECKETT>and that this is all a trap?

138
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,710
<3-26,FOWLER>那他们就不会约在韦德马克酒店见面
<3-26,FOWLER>Then they wouldn't be meeting at the Widmark Hotel.

139
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,910
<3-26,FOWLER>我们行事非常小心
<3-26,FOWLER>We were very careful.

140
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:02,000
<3-26,FOWLER>没人知道她联络了我们
<3-26,FOWLER>No one knows she's made contact with us.

141
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,010
<3-27,GATES>他们也有可能看到贝克特探长后
<3-27,GATES>Still, there's the risk that they could see detective Beckett

142
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,980
<3-27,GATES>认出她不是伊莲娜
<3-27,GATES>and realize that she's not Elena.

143
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,470
<3-28,FOWLER>短信中  他们让伊莲娜戴上红围巾
<3-28,FOWLER>In the text, they asked Elena to wear a red scarf,

144
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:11,720
<3-28,FOWLER>说明他们不知道她的长相
<3-28,FOWLER>which tells us that they don't know her on sight.

145
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,710
<3-28,FOWLER>我的人会在暗处观察你们的一举一动
<3-28,FOWLER>My people will be in place watching every move you make.

146
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:17,380
<3-28,FOWLER>我们还可以给你装上监听器  如果你愿意
<3-28,FOWLER>We can even fit you with a monitored mike, if you like.

147
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:18,260
<3-28,FOWLER>我...
<3-28,FOWLER>I...

148
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:21,790
<3-29,FOWLER>探长  现在事关重大
<3-29,FOWLER>Detective, something big is going on out there,

149
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:24,240
<3-29,FOWLER>这是我们查案的最佳机会
<3-29,FOWLER>and this is our best chance to find out what.

150
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:28,900
<3-29,FOWLER>会面安排在两小时后  我需要你的答复
<3-29,FOWLER>But the meeting's in two hours, so I need your answer.

151
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:33,690
<3-29,FOWLER>援兵到
<3-29,FOWLER>Reinforcements.

152
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:36,430
<4-1,CASTLE>卡塞尔
<4-1,CASTLE>Castle.

153
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:39,490
<4-2,BECKETT>听起来你的完成了不少写作啊
<4-2,BECKETT>Wow. You sound like you are getting a lot of writing done.

154
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:40,780
<4-3,CASTLE>都怪你
<4-3,CASTLE>I blame you for that.

155
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:41,900
<4-3,CASTLE>你什么时候回来
<4-3,CASTLE>When are you coming back?

156
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,050
<4-4,BECKETT>我不知道  几小时后吧
<4-4,BECKETT>Uh, I don't know. A couple hours?

157
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,420
<4-4,BECKETT>我有个会
<4-4,BECKETT>I have a meeting.

158
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:47,220
<4-4,BECKETT>别问我是什么会
<4-4,BECKETT>A-and don't ask me what it is.

159
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,490
<4-5,CASTLE>那我就偏要问了
<4-5,CASTLE>Well, now I have to ask.

160
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:51,750
<4-6,BECKETT>我得出发了
<4-6,BECKETT>It...look, I-I have to get going.

161
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,190
<4-6,BECKETT>回来能赶上晚饭
<4-6,BECKETT>I should be back in time for dinner.

162
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,600
<4-6,BECKETT>或许我们能一起喝杯红酒
<4-6,BECKETT>Maybe we can have a glass of wine together.

163
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,760
<4-7,CASTLE>我会把酒醒到完美状态的
<4-7,CASTLE>I will decant something amazing.

164
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,480
<4-8,BECKETT>好的  爱你  拜
<4-8,BECKETT>Okay. I love you. Bye.

165
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:01,470
<4-9,GATES>我得跟你说  我不在乎
<4-9,GATES>I have to tell you I don't care

166
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:04,150
<4-9,GATES>富勒警监强买强卖的那套
<4-9,GATES>for captain Fowler's hard-sell tactics.

167
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:05,730
<4-9,GATES>这是毒品案件
<4-9,GATES>This is a narcotics operation.

168
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:06,530
<4-9,GATES>这不关你的事
<4-9,GATES>It's not your problem,

169
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:08,720
<4-9,GATES>你可以拒绝  我承担压力
<4-9,GATES>so you can walk away and I'll take the heat.

170
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,550
<4-10,BECKETT>谢谢你  长官  但我能搞定
<4-10,BECKETT>Thank you, sir, but I-I can handle this.

171
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,690
<4-11,GATES>那他们准备再过一遍计划
<4-11,GATES>Then they're ready to review the plan

172
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:14,310
<4-11,GATES>然后给你个最后指示
<4-11,GATES>and give you a final briefing.

175
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:18,290
<5-1,FOWLER>记住  不要像警察那样行事
<5-1,FOWLER>Remember, don't move like a cop.

176
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,590
<5-1,FOWLER>你就是伊莲娜  你害怕他们
<5-1,FOWLER>You're Elena. You're intimidated by these guys.

177
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:36,790
<5-1,FOWLER>大堂里会有五个便衣警察
<5-1,FOWLER>There will be five plainclothes officers in the lobby

178
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,770
<5-1,FOWLER>酒店里遍布得更多
<5-1,FOWLER>and more throughout the hotel.

179
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:44,390
<5-1,FOWLER>搭北面的电梯  上11楼
<5-1,FOWLER>Head to the north elevator and go to the 11th floor.

180
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:47,050
<5-1,FOWLER>见面房间是1123
<5-1,FOWLER>The meet is in room 1123.

181
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,790
<6-1,FOWLER>楼上的卧底警官会支援你
<6-1,FOWLER>Undercover officers up there will have your back.

<6-1,FOWLER>Stay calm, memorize names and faces of whomever you meet,

184
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:01,400
<6-2,HARDEN>-你好  -你好
<6-2,HARDEN>- Hello. - Hi.

<6-3,BECKETT>Which floor?

186
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:04,080

187
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,450
<6-6,HARDEN>好的
<6-6,HARDEN>Okay.

188
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:14,740
<6-7,HARDEN>不许动
<6-7,HARDEN>Don't move a muscle.

190
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:20,750
<7-1,PLAINCLOTHES OFFICER>电梯到达11楼了
<7-1,PLAINCLOTHES OFFICER>Elevator just got to 11.

199
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:25,690
<7-1,PLAINCLOTHES OFFICER>是空的
<7-1,PLAINCLOTHES OFFICER>It's empty.

200
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:40,980
<7-1,PLAINCLOTHES OFFICER>我是凯特·贝克特探长
<7-1,PLAINCLOTHES OFFICER>This is detective Kate Beckett.

201
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,650
<7-1,PLAINCLOTHES OFFICER>如果听得见我说话  我被绑架了
<7-1,PLAINCLOTHES OFFICER>If you can hear me, I've been abducted.

202
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:46,190
<7-1,PLAINCLOTHES OFFICER>我在一辆白色货车里  纽约牌照
<7-1,PLAINCLOTHES OFFICER>I'm in a white cube van, New York plates.

203
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:48,810
<7-1,PLAINCLOTHES OFFICER>我们已经开了大约20分钟了
<7-1,PLAINCLOTHES OFFICER>We've been traveling for about 20 minutes.

204
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:51,040
<8-1,BECKETT>车拐了很多弯
<8-1,BECKETT>We've been making a lot of turns,

205
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,400
<8-1,BECKETT>但好像是开往东边
<8-1,BECKETT>but I think we're headed east.

206
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,430
<8-1,BECKETT>富勒警监  你能听到我说话吗
<8-1,BECKETT>Captain Fowler, if you can hear me,

207
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:57,820
<8-1,BECKETT>这已经严重破坏了我的晚餐计划
<8-1,BECKETT>this is seriously ruining my dinner plans.

208
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:00,590
<8-1,BECKETT>你向我保证你会照看好她
<8-1,BECKETT>You promised me that you had her back.

209
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:01,520
<9-1,GATES>怎么回事
<9-1,GATES>What happened?

210
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:03,630
<9-2,FOWLER>我们安排了个简单的会面
<9-2,FOWLER>We were set up for a simple meet,

211
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:05,440
<9-2,FOWLER>而不是有预谋的绑架
<9-2,FOWLER>not an orchestrated kidnapping.

212
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,880
<9-3,GATES>监控录像有没有拍到是谁干的
<9-3,GATES>The security cameras -- did they get a shot of who did this?

213
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,670
<9-4,FOWLER>整个酒店的监控录像都被暂时切断了
<9-4,FOWLER>They were disabled momentarily throughout the hotel.

214
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,190
<9-5,GATES>那贝克特身上装的窃听器呢
<9-5,GATES>What about the mike Beckett had on?

215
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,790
<9-6,FOWLER>她进了电梯之后我们就停止接收了
<9-6,FOWLER>We stopped receiving audio after she got in the elevator.

216
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:16,100
<9-6,FOWLER>信号在封闭的环境里强度下降
<9-6,FOWLER>The signal strength drops in enclosed spaces.

217
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:17,690
<9-7,GATES>让我猜猜
<9-7,GATES>And let me guess --

218
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,960
<9-7,GATES>住在1123号房的人根本不知道见面的事
<9-7,GATES>Whoever was in room 1123 didn't know about a meeting

219
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,740
<9-7,GATES>因为根本就没安排见面
<9-7,GATES>because there never was gonna be one.

220
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,510
<9-8,FOWLER>我们已经发布了限制警报
<9-8,FOWLER>Look, we've issued a limited alert.

221
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:26,600
<9-8,FOWLER>限制警报
<9-8,FOWLER>Limited alert?!

222
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:29,180
<9-9,GATES>我们得请求武装部队的支援
<9-9,GATES>We need to call in the Cavalry here.

223
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:31,750
<9-10,FOWLER>我们清楚贩毒集团追踪警方的无线通讯
<9-10,FOWLER>We know the drug ring tracks police radios.

224
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,040
<9-10,FOWLER>发送信号会让形势变得更糟
<9-10,FOWLER>Sending up a flare could make things worse.

225
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,300
<9-11,GATES>他们肯定知道了你那个线人交待了实情
<9-11,GATES>They must have known that your girl rolled on them,

226
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,780
<9-11,GATES>或者发现贝克特是警察
<9-11,GATES>or they made Beckett.

227
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,170
<9-11,GATES>总之  如果我们不马上找她的话她就会死的
<9-11,GATES>Either way, she's dead if we don't find her immediately.

228
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,120
<10-1,GATES>先生们  发生了点状况
<10-1,GATES>Gentlemen, we have a situation.

229
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:51,690
<10-1,GATES>车已经行走了大约一个小时  也许不止
<10-1,GATES>We've been driving for about an hour now, maybe more.

230
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:55,340
<10-1,GATES>双行车道  车流量不是很多
<10-1,GATES>Uh, two-lane road, not a lot of traffic, um...

231
00:08:58,770 --> 00:08:59,920
<11-1,BECKETT>减速了
<11-1,BECKETT>We're slowing down.

232
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:04,120
<11-1,BECKETT>车停下来了
<11-1,BECKETT>We've stopped.

233
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,100
<11-1,BECKETT>我得把窃听器扔掉了
<11-1,BECKETT>I've got to get rid of this thing.

234
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:09,070
<11-2,HARDEN>双膝跪地  脸面向驾驶室墙面
<11-2,HARDEN>Get on your knees and face the wall toward the cab.

235
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:10,090
<11-2,HARDEN>不许动
<11-2,HARDEN>Do not move.

236
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,020
<11-3,HARDEN>别转身
<11-3,HARDEN>Don't turn around.

237
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,980
<11-4,HARDEN>现在看看你身上有没有窃听器
<11-4,HARDEN>Time to see if you're wearing a wire.

238
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:30,770
<11-5,BECKETT>我身上没窃听器
<11-5,BECKETT>I'm not wearing a wire.

239
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,130
<11-6,HARDEN>一会儿就知道了
<11-6,HARDEN>Yeah, we'll see about that.

240
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:15,390
<11-6,HARDEN>我是凯特·贝克特探长
<11-6,HARDEN>This is Detective Kate Beckett.

241
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:17,950
<12-1,BECKETT>我现在没空接你电话  请留言
<12-1,BECKETT>I'm unavailable at the moment, but please leave a message.

242
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:24,240
<12-2,MARTHA RODGERS>我知道你今晚和凯瑟琳有计划
<12-2,MARTHA RODGERS>Well, I know you have plans with Katherine this evening,

243
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,150
<12-2,MARTHA RODGERS>我就识趣地不当电灯泡了
<12-2,MARTHA RODGERS>so I'm going to make myself scarce.

244
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,620
<12-2,MARTHA RODGERS>很好
<12-2,MARTHA RODGERS>Oh, very nice.

245
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,240
<12-2,MARTHA RODGERS>我要去参加《布里顿海滩》的重演
<12-2,MARTHA RODGERS>I'm off to a revival of "Brighton Beach Memoirs."

246
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,930
<12-2,MARTHA RODGERS>祝我好运吧
<12-2,MARTHA RODGERS>Ha. Pray for me.

247
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:35,080
<12-2,MARTHA RODGERS>怎么了
<12-2,MARTHA RODGERS>What's the matter?

248
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,800
<12-3,CASTLE>我联系不上贝克特
<12-3,CASTLE>I-I can't get ahold of Beckett.

249
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,190
<12-3,CASTLE>我给她发了短信  留言
<12-3,CASTLE>I texted her. I left messages.

250
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:39,750
<12-3,CASTLE>这不像她
<12-3,CASTLE>This isn't like her.

251
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,250
<12-4,MARTHA>也许她在分局有事走不开
<12-4,MARTHA>Maybe she got tied up at the precinct.

252
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,810
<12-4,MARTHA>你联系过莱恩和埃斯波西托了吗
<12-4,MARTHA>Have you tried Ryan or Esposito?

253
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,830
<12-5,CASTLE>我都打了  都直接转到留言信箱了
<12-5,CASTLE>I called them both -- just go straight to voicemail.

254
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:48,050
<12-5,CASTLE>我就觉得  有点不对劲
<12-5,CASTLE>Just... something is not right.

255
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,100
<13-1,BECKETT>现在要做什么
<13-1,BECKETT>So, what happens now?

256
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,800
<13-2,HARDEN>不是我说了算
<13-2,HARDEN>It's not my call.

257
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:33,370
<13-3,BECKETT>我们是在等他吗
<13-3,BECKETT>Is that who we're waiting for?

258
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,630
<13-3,BECKETT>那房间里的人
<13-3,BECKETT>They're in that room?

259
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,580
<13-4,HARDEN>你听上去很担心
<13-4,HARDEN>You sound worried.

260
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,560
<13-5,BECKETT>我该担心吗
<13-5,BECKETT>Should I be?

261
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,040
<13-6,HARDEN>你为什么这么特别
<13-6,HARDEN>What the hell makes you so special?

262
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,030
<13-7,BECKETT>我不特别
<13-7,BECKETT>I'm not special.

263
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:50,130
<13-7,BECKETT>我什么也不知道  我只负责转移包裹
<13-7,BECKETT>I don't know anything. I just move packages.

264
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:52,160
<13-7,BECKETT>我不构成威胁
<13-7,BECKETT>I'm not a threat to anyone.

265
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,570
<13-8,HARDEN>别再演戏了
<13-8,HARDEN>You can just drop the act.

266
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:10,910
<13-9,HARDEN>走吧  该你了
<13-9,HARDEN>Let's go. You're up.

272
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,860
<14-3,JONES>你是伊莲娜·马科夫
<14-3,JONES>You are Elena Markov?

273
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,080
<14-4,BECKETT>是的
<14-4,BECKETT>Yes.

274
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,080
<14-5,JONES>很高兴终于见到你
<14-5,JONES>It's good to finally meet you.

275
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:28,820
<14-5,JONES>你可以叫我琼斯先生  这位是海登先生
<14-5,JONES>You can call me Mr. Jones, and this is Mr. Harden.

276
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:32,100
<14-7,JONES>很抱歉见个面这么大费周章的
<14-7,JONES>I'm sorry for the lengths we go to to have a meeting,

277
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,990
<14-7,JONES>但是时代就是如此
<14-7,JONES>but these are the times we live in.

278
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,270
<14-7,JONES>需要点什么  喝酒吗
<14-7,JONES>Uh, can I get you anything? A drink?

279
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:38,450
<14-8,BECKETT>不用  谢谢
<14-8,BECKETT>No. Thank you.

280
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:40,760
<14-9,JONES>很好  那就谈正事
<14-9,JONES>Good. To business, then.

281
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:47,460
<14-9,JONES>你要知道我们有多重视你的服务
<14-9,JONES>You should know how much we value your services,

282
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:49,300
<14-9,JONES>尤其是拉兹拉斯
<14-9,JONES>Lazarus in particular.

283
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,970
<14-10,BECKETT>我尽我所能
<14-10,BECKETT>Well, I do the best I can.

284
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:54,750
<14-11,JONES>但一直是作为兼职
<14-11,JONES>But always as a freelancer.

285
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:59,080
<14-11,JONES>我们想要给你一个固定的职位
<14-11,JONES>What we want to do is offer you a permanent position

286
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,150
<14-11,JONES>为我们组织做事
<14-11,JONES>with our organization.

287
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:12,380
<14-12,JONES>当然了  这是周薪
<14-12,JONES>That's per week, of course.

288
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,420
<14-12,JONES>你觉得怎么样
<14-12,JONES>How does that strike you?

289
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,380
<14-13,BECKETT>出价很大方
<14-13,BECKETT>It's very generous.

290
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,340
<14-13,BECKETT>但是我要见拉兹拉斯一面
<14-13,BECKETT>But I'm gonna need to meet Lazarus.

291
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,420
<14-14,JONES>这可不行
<14-14,JONES>That's not an option.

292
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:35,220
<14-15,BECKETT>我得知道我在和谁做买卖
<14-15,BECKETT>I need to know who I'm doing business with.

293
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,510
<14-15,BECKETT>事关信任
<14-15,BECKETT>It's a matter of trust.

294
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:42,920
<14-16,JONES>好吧  我会向上级报告你的要求
<14-16,JONES>All right. I'll pass along the request,

295
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:46,800
<14-16,JONES>但得到答复之前你必须留在这儿
<14-16,JONES>but you'll remain our guest here until I get an answer.

296
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:48,740
<14-16,JONES>找间房让马科夫女士入住
<14-16,JONES>Please see Miss Markov to a bedroom.

297
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,670
<14-17,HARDEN>能和你说句话吗
<14-17,HARDEN>Sir, can I have a word, please?

298
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:54,850
<14-18,JONES>好  失陪一会儿
<14-18,JONES>Sure. Would you excuse me, please?

299
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,050
<15-1,JONES>-有什么事  -她有问题
<15-1,JONES>- What's the problem? - She's the problem.

300
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:16,340
<15-2,HARDEN>她完全不对劲
<15-2,HARDEN>She's all wrong.

301
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:28,400
<15-2,HARDEN>我一直在观察她
<15-2,HARDEN>Look, I've been watching her.

302
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:30,800
<15-2,HARDEN>她一副不知道为什么会来这儿的样子
<15-2,HARDEN>She acted like she didn't know why she was here.

303
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,740
<15-2,HARDEN>-埃斯波西托  -哈维  是我
<15-2,HARDEN>- Esposito. - Javi, Javi, it's me.

304
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:36,660
<17-1,ESPOSITO>贝克特  你在哪
<17-1,ESPOSITO>Beckett, where are you?

305
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,630
<17-2,BECKETT>一半警队都出动找你呢  大家快来
<17-2,BECKETT>We've got half the force looking for you. Hey!

306
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:42,450
<17-3,ESPOSITO>听着  追踪这通电话找到我
<17-3,ESPOSITO>No. Listen. Get a trace on this phone. Get eyes on me.

307
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:45,250
<17-4,BECKETT>我不知道我在哪  伊莲娜·马科夫是谁
<17-4,BECKETT>I don't know where I am or who the hell Elena Markov is,

308
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,270
<17-4,BECKETT>但她没讲实话
<17-4,BECKETT>but her story is a lie.

309
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:50,230
<17-4,BECKETT>她不只是底层运毒人
<17-4,BECKETT>She is more than just a low-level courier.

310
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,610
<17-4,BECKETT>你向来不喜欢我们招的新人
<17-4,BECKETT>You never like it when we bring new people in,

311
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:54,130
<18-1,JONES>特别是职位高于你的新人
<18-1,JONES>especially above you.

312
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:56,090
<18-2,HARDEN>不是  这次不是这么回事
<18-2,HARDEN>That's not what it is, not this time.

313
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,300
<18-2,HARDEN>她很害怕
<18-2,HARDEN>Okay, she was afraid.

314
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,620
<18-3,JONES>好  你就留心着她
<18-3,JONES>All right, you keep an eye on her,

315
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:04,340
<18-3,JONES>如果她真有问题  那你来解决她
<18-3,JONES>And if she is wrong, then you get to do the honors, okay?

316
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:09,550
<18-3,JONES>走吧
<18-3,JONES>Let's go.

317
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:22,680
<18-3,JONES>你是说我们追踪不了贝克特的电话吗
<18-3,JONES>Are you telling me that we can't trace Beckett's call?

318
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,660
<20-1,GATES>这是网络语音电话  通过匿名服务器连接
<20-1,GATES>It's a voice-over-internet line fed through an anonymizer.

319
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,900
<20-2,ESPOSITO>好吧  但我们总可以缩小范围吧
<20-2,ESPOSITO>Okay, but can we at least narrow it down

320
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,960
<20-3,GATES>缩小到打电话的区域
<20-3,GATES>to the area where the call was made?

321
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,470
<20-3,GATES>不行  信号通过乌克兰
<20-3,GATES>No, it was routed through the Ukraine,

322
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,800
<20-4,ESPOSITO>又经由欧洲各地
<20-4,ESPOSITO>bounced all over Europe.

323
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,150
<20-4,ESPOSITO>这些人做足了安全措施
<20-4,ESPOSITO>These guys know security.

324
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:37,750
<20-5,GATES>警监  为什么贝克特说
<20-5,GATES>Captain, why did Beckett tell us

325
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:41,730
<20-5,GATES>伊莲娜·马科夫不仅仅是个运毒人
<20-5,GATES>that Elena Markov was more than just a courier?

326
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,010
<20-6,FOWLER>我也不清楚
<20-6,FOWLER>I have no idea.

327
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:46,230
<20-7,GATES>那么你没有对我们隐瞒有关她的事咯
<20-7,GATES>So, there's nothing about her that you haven't told us?

328
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,470
<20-8,FOWLER>绝对没有
<20-8,FOWLER>Absolutely not.

329
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:50,090
<20-8,FOWLER>她所讲的事情都证实了  但是
<20-8,FOWLER>Every part of her story checked out, but...

330
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:50,930
<20-9,GATES>什么
<20-9,GATES>But what?

331
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,910
<20-10,FOWLER>我们没有时间深入查证
<20-10,FOWLER>We didn't have enough time to go deep,

332
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:55,410
<20-10,FOWLER>事态进展得太快了
<20-10,FOWLER>not with things moving this fast.

333
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,460
<20-10,FOWLER>我们昨天才知道马科夫女士的事
<20-10,FOWLER>We didn't even know Miss Markov until yesterday.

334
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,310
<20-11,GATES>也许你根本不了解她
<20-11,GATES>Well, maybe you didn't know her at all.

335
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,720
<20-12,RYAN>我们可以去弥补这点
<20-12,RYAN>Looks like we can fix that.

336
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,360
<20-12,RYAN>医院刚打来电话说她醒了
<20-12,RYAN>The hospital just called. She's conscious.

337
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,300
<20-13,GATES>去审问她  查清事情的来龙去脉
<20-13,GATES>Go talk to her. Get to the bottom of this.

338
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,720
<20-14,FOWLER>我和你一起去  她认识我
<20-14,FOWLER>I'll go with you. She knows me.

339
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:12,620
<20-15,CASTLE>你们都没有回复我的电话
<20-15,CASTLE>Hey, you guys have not been returning my calls.

340
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,280
<20-15,CASTLE>贝克特在哪
<20-15,CASTLE>Where's Beckett?

341
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:19,910
<20-16,GATES>卡塞尔先生  去我办公室谈吧
<20-16,GATES>Mr. Castle, why don't you come into my office?

342
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:39,370
<20-16,GATES>赶快  跟上
<20-16,GATES>Hurry it up! Quickly.

343
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,180
<20-16,GATES>过来  往前走  这个方向
<20-16,GATES>Over here. Let's go. Come here.

344
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,790
<21-1,CASTLE>我们知道她在哪吗
<21-1,CASTLE>Do we have any idea where she is?

345
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,840
<21-2,GATES>交通监控录像拍到了一辆白色货车
<21-2,GATES>Traffic-cam footage caught a white van

346
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,760
<21-2,GATES>在她被绑架时驶离韦德马克酒店
<21-2,GATES>heading away from the widmark right when she was abducted.

347
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,670
<21-2,GATES>我们认为她在里头  也在尽力追查那辆车
<21-2,GATES>We think she was in it, and we're trying to track it down.

348
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:57,390
<21-2,GATES>还是有希望的
<21-2,GATES>There are reasons for hope here.

349
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,140
<21-3,CASTLE>愿闻其详
<21-3,CASTLE>I'd love to hear them.

350
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:01,960
<21-4,GATES>首先  他们没有认出她是警察
<21-4,GATES>First of all, they didn't make her as a cop.

351
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:05,140
<21-4,GATES>以为她是伊莲娜·马科夫  这就争取了时间
<21-4,GATES>They think she's Elena Markov, which buys us time.

352
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,640
<21-5,CASTLE>她假装成伊莲娜
<21-5,CASTLE>She's pretending to be Elena

353
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,540
<21-5,CASTLE>但她根本不知道伊莲娜是谁
<21-5,CASTLE>when she doesn't know who Elena is?

354
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,580
<21-5,CASTLE>她不可能永远不露馅的
<21-5,CASTLE>She can't keep that up forever.

355
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,180
<21-6,GATES>希望我们在露馅之前找到她
<21-6,GATES>Well, hopefully, she won't have to.

356
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,040
<21-6,GATES>只要伊莲娜告诉我们她知道的一切
<21-6,GATES>Once Elena tells us everything that she knows about this,

357
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,130
<21-6,GATES>就能顺藤摸瓜找到贝克特
<21-6,GATES>it could lead us to Beckett.

358
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,570
<22-1,DOCTOR BAILEY>大概一小时前马科夫女士苏醒了
<22-1,DOCTOR BAILEY>Miss markov regained consciousness about an hour ago.

359
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:23,000
<22-1,DOCTOR BAILEY>她情况稳定  所以我们把她移出了特护病房
<22-1,DOCTOR BAILEY>She's stable, so we transferred her out of ICU.

360
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,030
<22-2,RYAN>她说什么了吗
<22-2,RYAN>Has she said anything yet?

361
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:25,520
<22-3,DOCTOR BAILEY>只说活着真好
<22-3,DOCTOR BAILEY>Just that she's glad to be alive.

362
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,670
<22-4,FOWLER>她是清醒的吗
<22-4,FOWLER>So, she's lucid?

363
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,190
<22-5,DOCTOR BAILEY>是  但她遭遇这些痛苦后非常虚弱
<22-5,DOCTOR BAILEY>Yes, but she's also extremely weak from her ordeal,

364
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:31,680
<22-5,DOCTOR BAILEY>所以你们必须缩短审问时间
<22-5,DOCTOR BAILEY>so, please, I'd ask that you limit your time with her

365
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,590
<22-5,DOCTOR BAILEY>越短越好
<22-5,DOCTOR BAILEY>as much as possible.

366
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:34,900
<22-6,ESPOSITO>我们要得到答案  花再多时间也要审问到底
<22-6,ESPOSITO>We need answers, so we're gonna question her as long as it takes.

367
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,770
<22-7,DOCTOR BAILEY>就在前面  3410病房
<22-7,DOCTOR BAILEY>Room's just up here -- 3410.

368
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:40,830
<22-8,RYAN>我以为你派了警员看守她
<22-8,RYAN>I thought you had an officer guarding her.

369
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,410
<22-9,FOWLER>是的  他肯定在里头
<22-9,FOWLER>We do. He must be inside with her.

370
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:45,430
<22-10,ESPOSITO>伊莲娜·马科夫  纽约警察
<22-10,ESPOSITO>Elena Markov, NYP--

371
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,950
<22-11,RYAN>妈的
<22-11,RYAN>Son of a bitch.

372
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,140
<22-12,ESPOSITO>有警员受伤  警员受伤
<22-12,ESPOSITO>We have an officer down! Officer down!

373
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,160
<22-13,RYAN>伊莲娜不见了
<22-13,RYAN>Elena's gone.

374
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,540
<22-14,FOWLER>要么她杀了他逃了
<22-14,FOWLER>Either she killed him and fled...

375
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,280
<22-15,RYAN>或者别人杀了他带走了她
<22-15,RYAN>Or someone else did and they grabbed her.

376
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:57,090
<22-15,RYAN>如果是他们带走了伊莲娜  那就是贝克特露馅了
<22-15,RYAN>If they took Elena, that means Beckett's cover's blown.

377
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,350
<22-15,RYAN>那她就死定了
<22-15,RYAN>She's as good as dead.

378
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:08,570
<23-1,BECKETT>亲爱的里克
<23-1,BECKETT>Dear Rick,

379
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,910
<23-1,BECKETT>不知道我还有多少时间了
<23-1,BECKETT>I don't know how much time I have,

380
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:14,420
<23-1,BECKETT>说不定写这封信的时间也不够了
<23-1,BECKETT>even to write this letter.

381
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:17,280
<23-1,BECKETT>我知道的是  我已经被卷进来了
<23-1,BECKETT>What I do know now is that I'm in this,

382
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:19,350
<23-1,BECKETT>我活下来的唯一方法就是
<23-1,BECKETT>and the only way I'm gonna make it out alive

383
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:21,000
<23-1,BECKETT>把这个任务完成
<23-1,BECKETT>is to see this through.

384
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,150
<23-1,BECKETT>我知道大家都在找我
<23-1,BECKETT>I'm sure everyone is looking for me,

385
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:24,400
<23-1,BECKETT>如果他们知道我曾经在这里
<23-1,BECKETT>and if they figure out I was here,

386
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,340
<23-1,BECKETT>那鉴证组的人肯定会搜查这个房子
<23-1,BECKETT>CSU's gonna search this house.

387
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:30,240
<23-1,BECKETT>他们会搜寻血迹  那他们就会找到这个
<23-1,BECKETT>They're gonna look for blood, and they will find it,

388
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,620
<23-1,BECKETT>这样就能发现这封信了
<23-1,BECKETT>which will lead them to this letter.

389
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,910
<23-1,BECKETT>亲爱的  这是给你的信
<23-1,BECKETT>Babe, it's your letter,

391
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:39,680
<23-1,BECKETT>因为我想亲口对你说这些
<23-1,BECKETT>that I can tell you all of these things in person,

392
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,520
<23-1,BECKETT>但假如我发生了什么不测
<23-1,BECKETT>but if something happens and I don't make it,

393
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,970
<23-1,BECKETT>我希望你知道  我们的合作关系
<23-1,BECKETT>I need you to know that our partnership,

394

<23-1,BECKETT>我们的恋情

<23-1,BECKETT>is the greatest thing that has ever happened to me.

396
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:55,470
<23-1,BECKETT>你是个非常棒的人
<23-1,BECKETT>You're an amazing man,

397
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,410
<23-1,BECKETT>我爱你  全心全意
<23-1,BECKETT>and I love you with all of my heart.

398
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,700
<23-1,BECKETT>直到永远
<23-1,BECKETT>Always.

399
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:10,140
<24-1,HARDEN>琼斯先生有话和你说
<24-1,HARDEN>Mr. Jones wants a word.

400
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:24,790
<24-1,HARDEN>进来吧
<24-1,HARDEN>Let's go.

401
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:36,780
<25-1,JONES>我有个令人意外的消息
<25-1,JONES>I've got surprising news.

402
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,010
<25-1,JONES>拉兹拉斯同意见你了
<25-1,JONES>Lazarus agreed to meet with you

403
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:41,540
<25-1,JONES>不过你得先答应完成一项任务
<25-1,JONES>if you agree to an assignment.

404
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:44,060
<25-2,BECKETT>什么任务
<25-2,BECKETT>What assignment?

405
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:47,480
<25-3,JONES>等你完成了任务  你就能和他见面
<25-3,JONES>You complete the assignment, you get the meeting.

406
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:48,810
<25-3,JONES>要么接受  要么放弃
<25-3,JONES>Take it or leave it.

407
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:53,900
<25-4,BECKETT>成交  我需要做什么
<25-4,BECKETT>Deal. What do I have to do?

408
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,290
<25-5,JONES>你最擅长的事
<25-5,JONES>What you do best.

409
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:00,740
<25-5,JONES>杀掉他
<25-5,JONES>Kill him.

410
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:03,730
<25-6,JONES>要干净利落的
<25-6,JONES>Make it clean.

411
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,350
<26-1,HARDEN>我们到了
<26-1,HARDEN>We're here.

412
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,110
<26-1,HARDEN>这是哪里
<26-1,HARDEN>Where's here?

413
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:17,540
<26-3,HARDEN>你只要知道目标就在这座房子里就行了
<26-3,HARDEN>All you need to know is that the target's in that house.

414
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,390
<26-4,BECKETT>他一个人吗
<26-4,BECKETT>Is he alone?

415
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:20,430
<26-5,HARDEN>据我所知是的
<26-5,HARDEN>As far as I know.

416
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:21,840
<26-5,HARDEN>用这个
<26-5,HARDEN>Use this.

417
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,860
<26-5,HARDEN>拉兹拉斯不希望这个和你其他的任务联系起来
<26-5,HARDEN>Lazarus doesn't want it to be connected to your other kills.

418
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,000
<26-6,BECKETT>这人一定很重要吧  他是谁
<26-6,BECKETT>Well, he's got to be important. Who is he?

419
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:30,680
<26-7,HARDEN>他是名单上的下一个人
<26-7,HARDEN>He's the next name on the list.

420
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:33,190
<26-8,BECKETT>他做了什么
<26-8,BECKETT>What does he do?

421
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:36,190
<26-9,HARDEN>你怎么突然变得这么好奇了
<26-9,HARDEN>Why are you so curious all of a sudden?

422
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:40,810
<26-9,HARDEN>你没听说过调查吗
<26-9,HARDEN>You ever hear of recon?

423
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:42,990
<26-10,BECKETT>我做事之前喜欢先调查清楚
<26-10,BECKETT>I like to know what I'm walking into.

424
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:45,010
<26-10,BECKETT>他是不是警察  是不是毒品贩子
<26-10,BECKETT>Is he a cop, is he a drug dealer,

425
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:46,490
<26-10,BECKETT>这房子里有枪吗
<26-10,BECKETT>Are there guns in the house?

426
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:48,930
<26-10,BECKETT>好奇心让我活到现在
<26-10,BECKETT>Curiosity keeps me alive.

427
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,770
<26-11,HARDEN>他就是个普通人  无名小卒
<26-11,HARDEN>The guy's a civilian, a nobody.

428
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:52,580
<26-12,BECKETT>如果他是无名小卒  那为什么要杀他
<26-12,BECKETT>If he's a nobody, then why are we killing him?

429
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:53,810
<26-13,HARDEN>因为上头吩咐我们这么做
<26-13,HARDEN>Because they told us to.

430
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:01,680
<26-14,HARDEN>这里有什么问题吗
<26-14,HARDEN>Look, is there -- is there a problem here?

431
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,760
<26-15,BECKETT>有问题  我不是这样做事的
<26-15,BECKETT>Yeah, there's a problem. I don't work like this.

432
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:05,700
<26-15,BECKETT>我必须得了解清楚情况
<26-15,BECKETT>I do my homework,

433
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:08,850
<26-15,BECKETT>我要对情况有所掌控  这次太草率了
<26-15,BECKETT>I control the variables, and this is sloppy.

434
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:12,150
<26-16,HARDEN>也许拉兹拉斯想看看你随机应变的能力
<26-16,HARDEN>You know, maybe Lazarus wanted to see how well you improvise.

435
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,790
<26-16,HARDEN>也许  这也是我想看看的
<26-16,HARDEN>You know, maybe I do, too.

436
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,990
<26-16,HARDEN>好了  你到底是杀还是不杀
<26-16,HARDEN>Now...are you gonna kill him or what?

437
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:14,350
<27-1,EVAN POTTER>你他妈的是谁
<27-1,EVAN POTTER>Who in the hell are you?!

438
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:30,150
<28-1,BECKETT>办完了
<28-1,BECKETT>It's done.

439
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,170
<28-2,HARDEN>证明给我看
<28-2,HARDEN>Show me.

440
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,470
<28-2,HARDEN>什么
<28-2,HARDEN>What?

441
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:37,890
<28-3,BECKETT>不  我们没有时间了
<28-3,BECKETT>No. We don't have time for this.

442
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:38,990
<28-4,HARDEN>我说了  证明给我看
<28-4,HARDEN>I said show me.

443
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:40,940
<28-4,HARDEN>马上
<28-4,HARDEN>Now.

444
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:57,030
<29-1,BECKETT>正如我所说
<29-1,BECKETT>Like I said.

445
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:06,720
<29-1,BECKETT>我受够这种测试了
<29-1,BECKETT>I'm done auditioning.

446
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:09,110
<29-2,BECKETT>你告诉拉兹拉斯如果他再这么玩弄我
<29-2,BECKETT>You tell Lazarus he wants to play games

447
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,360
<29-2,BECKETT>交易就取消
<29-2,BECKETT>and this deal's off.

448
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:17,830
<29-3,HARDEN>好  我们回去吧
<29-3,HARDEN>Yeah, we should get back.

449
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:28,160
<29-3,HARDEN>刚又完成了一遍医院安保的检查
<29-3,HARDEN>Just got off with the hospital security again.

450
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:29,330
<30-1,RYAN>整幢楼都封锁了
<30-1,RYAN>The building's locked down.

451
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:30,590
<30-1,RYAN>我们派人进去搜查了
<30-1,RYAN>We got teams going through,

452
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:31,610
<30-1,RYAN>不过至今没有发现伊莲娜的踪影
<30-1,RYAN>but there's no sign of Elena.

453
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:33,580
<30-2,CASTLE>我们还是不知道这个女人到底是谁
<30-2,CASTLE>And we still have no idea who this woman really is.

454
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:34,600
<30-2,CASTLE>恐怕我们知道了
<30-2,CASTLE>I'm afraid we do.

455
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,070
<30-3,FOWLER>监控摄像头显示她是一个人离开的
<30-3,FOWLER>Security video shows her leaving her room alone,

456
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:38,130
<30-3,FOWLER>警官被割喉的方式
<30-3,FOWLER>and the officer's throat was cut

457
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:40,730
<30-3,FOWLER>和那些被割喉的毒贩子的方式完全一致
<30-3,FOWLER>in the same exact manner as the murdered drug dealers --

458
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:43,940
<30-3,FOWLER>角度吻合  都是左撇子  直奔颈动脉
<30-3,FOWLER>Same angle, same left-handed stroke favoring the carotid.

459
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,780
<30-4,GATES>那些短信所说的
<30-4,GATES>That's what those text messages meant

460
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:47,300
<30-4,GATES>关于包裹已被送达
<30-4,GATES>about packages being delivered.

461
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,900
<30-4,GATES>她根本不是贩毒组织的快递员
<30-4,GATES>She wasn't a courier for the ring.

462
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,250
<30-5,ESPOSITO>她是他们的雇佣杀手
<30-5,ESPOSITO>She was their contract killer.

463
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:51,510
<30-6,CASTLE>雇佣杀手
<30-6,CASTLE>A contract killer?!

464
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,380
<30-6,CASTLE>那是贝克特正在冒充的人
<30-6,CASTLE>That's who Beckett is out there impersonating

465
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,430
<30-6,CASTLE>你之前不知道
<30-6,CASTLE>and you didn't know?

466
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:55,220
<30-7,GATES>卡塞尔先生
<30-7,GATES>Mr. Castle --

467
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:57,600
<30-8,CASTLE>现在这个女人逍遥法外
<30-8,CASTLE>And now this woman is out there somewhere?

468
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,200
<30-8,CASTLE>你到底知不知道假如伊莲娜现身
<30-8,CASTLE>Do you have any idea what's gonna happen to Beckett

469
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,590
<30-8,CASTLE>贝克特会有多危险
<30-8,CASTLE>when the real Elena shows up?

470
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:01,960
<30-9,FOWLER>我们正在尽一切可能找到她

<41-2,SIMMONS>and what do they know about Lazarus?

588
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:43,600
<41-3,BECKETT>你想要不雅
<41-3,BECKETT>Do you want undignified?

589
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:47,290
<41-3,BECKETT>等着看我怎么收拾你吧
<41-3,BECKETT>Then wait till you see what I do to you.

590
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:51,140
<41-4,SIMMONS>知道吗  你真的很像你妈妈
<41-4,SIMMONS>You know, you're just like your mama --

591
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:54,280
<41-4,SIMMONS>不属于这个世界  却要在这玩火
<41-4,SIMMONS>both playing in worlds where you don't belong.

592
00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:00,490
<41-5,SIMMONS>你母亲付出了生命的代价
<41-5,SIMMONS>Your mother paid for it with her life.

593
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:01,920
<41-5,SIMMONS>你也会的
<41-5,SIMMONS>So will you.

594
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:03,800
<41-5,SIMMONS>不过首先
<41-5,SIMMONS>But first...

595
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:15,110
<41-6,SIMMONS>把我想知道的告诉我
<41-6,SIMMONS>...tell me what I want to know.

596
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:24,640
<42-1,ESPOSITO>刚跟运营商联系了
<42-1,ESPOSITO>Yo. Just got off with the carrier.

597
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:25,810
<42-2,CASTLE>知道电话在哪了吗
<42-2,CASTLE>Any idea whose phone it is?

598
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:27,990
<42-3,ESPOSITO>是预付电话  无法确认持有者
<42-3,ESPOSITO>It's a pre-paid. There's no way to identify the owner.

599
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,230
<42-4,TORY>有线索了
<42-4,TORY>I got a hit.

600
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:30,340
<42-4,TORY>信号是从斯卡斯代尔的信号塔发出的
<42-4,TORY>The signal originated from a tower in Scarsdale.

602
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,130
<42-5,GATES>很好  能确定位置吗
<42-5,GATES>Great. Can you lock on the location?

603
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:35,110
<42-6,TORY>不行  那条信息只经过了一个信号塔
<42-6,TORY>No. The message pinged off a single tower.

604
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,110
<42-6,TORY>斯卡斯代尔  纽约
<42-6,TORY>三角定位  失败

605
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,550
<42-6,TORY>如果没有其他两个信号塔
<42-6,TORY>Without a second or third tower,

606
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:39,100
<42-6,TORY>就无法缩小范围
<42-6,TORY>there's no way to narrow it down.

607
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:40,580
<42-6,TORY>根据信号强度判断
<42-6,TORY>Depending on signal strength,

608
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:42,060
<42-6,TORY>它可以是从十英里半径范围内的
<42-6,TORY>it could have originated anywhere

609
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,710
<42-6,TORY>任何地方发出的
<42-6,TORY>within this 10-mile radius.

610
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,760
<42-7,ESPOSITO>这比海里捞针还难
<42-7,ESPOSITO>It would be easier to find a needle in a haystack.

611
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:47,320
<42-8,CASTLE>你能定位到电话的GPS吗
<42-8,CASTLE>Can you ping the GPS?

612
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:47,880
<42-9,TORY>关了  而且电话好像也关了
<42-9,TORY>It's off, and it looks like the phone's off, as well.

614
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:52,350
<42-9,TORY>抱歉  没有其他办法追踪了
<42-9,TORY>I'm sorry. I've got no other way to trace it.

616
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:53,950
<42-9,TORY>我已经尽力了
<42-9,TORY>That's the best I can do.

617
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,220
<43-1,SIMMONS>我知道你的肺快炸了
<43-1,SIMMONS>I know your lungs are burning.

618
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:10,730
<43-1,SIMMONS>我能感受到你灵魂深处的恐慌
<43-1,SIMMONS>I can feel the panic in your soul.

619
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:15,510
<43-1,SIMMONS>你只想让这一切结束
<43-1,SIMMONS>All you want is for this to end.

620
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:18,290
<43-1,SIMMONS>我保证我会让这一切结束的
<43-1,SIMMONS>And I promise I will end it.

621
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,950
<43-1,SIMMONS>只要你把我想知道的告诉我
<43-1,SIMMONS>Just tell me what I want to know.

622
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:38,330
<43-2,SIMMONS>把这里清理干净
<43-2,SIMMONS>Scrub the place.

623
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:43,430
<43-3,SIMMONS>找块地把她埋了
<43-3,SIMMONS>Find a patch of dirt to put her in --

624
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,810
<43-3,SIMMONS>别让人找到她
<43-3,SIMMONS>somewhere where she won't be found.

625
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:52,780
<44-1,HARDEN>我喜欢这片树林
<44-1,HARDEN>I love these woods.

626
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:57,050
<44-1,HARDEN>我爸爸以前常带我来打猎
<44-1,HARDEN>My daddy used to take me hunting up here when I was a kid.

627
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,230
<44-1,HARDEN>我花了好几天研究每块石头  每棵树
<44-1,HARDEN>I spent days learning every rock, every tree,

628
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:04,190
<44-1,HARDEN>还有所有可以藏身的地方
<44-1,HARDEN>all the secret little places to hide.

629
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:07,410
<44-1,HARDEN>这么多年来总能派上用场
<44-1,HARDEN>Over the years, it's come in handy.

630
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:21,080
<44-2,HARDEN>知道吗  你一走进那扇门
<44-2,HARDEN>You know, I had you made

631
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,970
<44-2,HARDEN>我就看穿你了
<44-2,HARDEN>from the moment you walked through the door.

632
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:24,470
<44-2,HARDEN>从你眼里就可以看出
<44-2,HARDEN>I could see it in your eyes.

633
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:26,600
<44-2,HARDEN>我想  这女人不可能是杀手
<44-2,HARDEN>I thought, "No way this woman's a killer."

634
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:28,620
<44-2,HARDEN>不可能
<44-2,HARDEN>No.

635
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,170
<44-3,BECKETT>你不会想杀我的  海登
<44-3,BECKETT>You don't want to kill me, Harden.

636
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:32,360
<44-3,BECKETT>你知道我是警察
<44-3,BECKETT>You know that I'm a cop.

637
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,010
<44-4,HARDEN>我以前也杀过警察
<44-4,HARDEN>Yeah, I've killed cops before.

638
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:36,100
<44-4,HARDEN>事实上  其中一些马上就是你的新邻居了
<44-4,HARDEN>In fact, a few of them are your new neighbors.

639
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:38,400
<44-5,BECKETT>我的人会来找我的  他们会杀了你
<44-5,BECKETT>My people will hunt you down. They will kill you.

640
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:39,880
<44-5,BECKETT>我们可以做个交易
<44-5,BECKETT>But we can make a deal.

641
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:44,330
<44-5,BECKETT>帮我整垮拉兹拉斯  你想要什么都可以
<44-5,BECKETT>You help me take down Lazarus, you can set any deal you want.

642
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:47,740
<44-6,HARDEN>不  我对目前的生意很满意  多谢
<44-6,HARDEN>No, I'm good with the deal I got. Thank you.

643
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:06,160
<44-7,BECKETT>伊莲娜
<44-7,BECKETT>Elena.

644
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:08,820
<44-8,ELENA>我得说  你有种
<44-8,ELENA>You got balls. I'll give you that.

645
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:16,300
<44-9,BECKETT>你不杀我吗
<44-9,BECKETT>You're not gonna kill me?

646
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,230
<44-10,ELENA>他让我来  因为他欠你的
<44-10,ELENA>He sent me because he owed you.

647
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:21,800
<44-10,ELENA>他说他想让你活着
<44-10,ELENA>He said he wanted you to live.

648
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:23,940
<44-11,BECKETT>谁让你来的
<44-11,BECKETT>Who sent you?

649
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:26,630
<44-11,BECKETT>谁想让我活着
<44-11,BECKETT>Who wanted me to live?

650
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,750
<44-12,ELENA>拉兹拉斯
<44-12,ELENA>Lazarus.

651
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:42,620
<45-1,FOWLER>战术小队在凌晨六点突击了那里
<45-1,FOWLER>Tactical teams raided the compound at 0600 this morning,

652
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:43,840
<45-1,FOWLER>就在你打电话后不久
<45-1,FOWLER>shortly after your call.

653
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:46,620
<45-1,FOWLER>那里已经空了  什么都没了
<45-1,FOWLER>The place was empty. Everything's gone.

654
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:49,320
<45-2,GATES>房子属于一个海外公司的
<45-2,GATES>The mansion itself is held in a trust

655
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,000
<45-2,GATES>信托机构
<45-2,GATES>by an offshore corporation.

656
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,830
<45-2,GATES>要花好几个月才能找到真正的主人
<45-2,GATES>It'll be months before we find out who the real owners are.

657
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:54,710
<45-3,FOWLER>如果真能找到的话
<45-3,FOWLER>If ever.

658
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:57,320
<45-4,CASTLE>瓦肯·西蒙斯呢
<45-4,CASTLE>And what about Vulcan Simmons?

659
00:37:57,590 --> 00:38:00,140
<45-5,FOWLER>我的小队今早在华盛顿高地拘捕了他
<45-5,FOWLER>My team picked him up this morning in Washington Heights --

660
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:01,510
<45-5,FOWLER>那离这儿很远
<45-5,FOWLER>nowhere near the compound.

661
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,560
<45-6,GATES>他们审了他一个上午  但…
<45-6,GATES>They've been questioning him all the morning, but --

662
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,590
<45-7,BECKETT>他有不在场证明
<45-7,BECKETT>He had an alibi for last night.

663
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,410
<45-8,FOWLER>我们会继续调查他  但是没有任何证据
<45-8,FOWLER>We'll go after him, but without evidence,

664
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:12,050
<45-8,FOWLER>你的一切指控都很难成立
<45-8,FOWLER>it will difficult to make any of your allegations stick.

665
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,870
<45-9,CASTLE>你是说我们一无所获吗
<45-9,CASTLE>Are you saying we have nothing?

666
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:19,040
<45-10,BECKETT>不  不是一无所获
<45-10,BECKETT>No, not nothing.

668
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,190
<45-11,FOWLER>未来期货
<45-11,FOWLER>Future Forward?

669
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:32,200
<45-12,BECKETT>没错  这是洗钱集团的一部分
<45-12,BECKETT>Yeah, part of the money-laundering operation --

670
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:33,480
<45-12,BECKETT>不管这是个什么
<45-12,BECKETT>whatever it was,

671
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:36,590
<45-12,BECKETT>他们都转了一大笔钱到这个账户上
<45-12,BECKETT>they are funneling a lot of cash into that account.

672
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:47,260
<45-13,CASTLE>你看  我只要一不在你身边就出事了吧
<45-13,CASTLE>See what happens when I leave you alone?

673
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:49,190
<45-14,BECKETT>宝贝  你从来没离开过我
<45-14,BECKETT>Babe, I wasn't alone.

674
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:51,510
<45-14,BECKETT>当他们拷问我的时候
<45-14,BECKETT>When they were interrogating me,

675
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,730
<45-14,BECKETT>让我撑下来的唯一动力就是想着你
<45-14,BECKETT>the only thing that kept me going was thinking about you,

676
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:58,910
<45-14,BECKETT>还有我们的未来  我们的婚礼
<45-14,BECKETT>about our future, the wedding.

677
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:02,150
<45-14,BECKETT>你一直都在我身边
<45-14,BECKETT>You were with me the whole time.

678
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:10,130
<45-15,CASTLE>我们也不算是全盘皆输
<45-15,CASTLE>Well, at least it's not a total loss.

679
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:12,970
<45-15,CASTLE>现在警察知道瓦肯·西蒙斯就是拉兹拉斯
<45-15,CASTLE>Now that the police know that Vulcan Simmons is Lazarus,

680
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:13,920
<45-15,CASTLE>他们就会一直留意他的举动
<45-15,CASTLE>they'll be watching him.

681
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,260
<45-15,CASTLE>他没机会东山再起了
<45-15,CASTLE>He will not be able to rebuild his operation.

682
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,840
<45-16,BECKETT>他不是拉兹拉斯
<45-16,BECKETT>He's not Lazarus.

683
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:21,300
<45-16,BECKETT>如果是他的话  我早就死了
<45-16,BECKETT>If he was, then I would be dead.

684
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:24,260
<45-16,BECKETT>瓦肯·西蒙斯只是个傀儡
<45-16,BECKETT>Vulcan Simmons is just a figurehead.

685
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:26,790
<45-16,BECKETT>幕后黑手另有他人  一个权利更大
<45-16,BECKETT>Someone else is behind this, someone higher up,

686
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:28,760
<45-16,BECKETT>并且想留我一条活路的人
<45-16,BECKETT>someone who wanted me alive.

687
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:31,390
<45-17,CASTLE>谁
<45-17,CASTLE>Who?

688
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:35,010
<45-18,BECKETT>一个势力更大的人
<45-18,BECKETT>Someone bigger.

690
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,230
<46-1,GATES>这不可能啊
<46-1,GATES>This can't be right.

691
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:38,140
<46-2,ESPOSITO>恐怕事实就是如此  头
<46-2,ESPOSITO>I'm afraid it is, sir.

692
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:40,250
<46-3,FOWLER>你是说未来期货是个
<46-3,FOWLER>You're saying that's what Future Forward is --

693
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:41,590
<46-3,FOWLER>超级政治行动委员会
<46-3,FOWLER>a political super pac?

694
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,890
<46-3,FOWLER>那些黑钱都流向这里了
<46-3,FOWLER>That's where the money was going?

695
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:45,000
<46-4,RYAN>而且这也是这起案件跟那个差点被杀死的
<46-4,RYAN>Yeah, and that's a connection to Evan Potter,

696
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:45,930
<46-4,RYAN>伊万·波特之间的联系
<46-4,RYAN>our would-be victim.

697
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:48,260
<46-5,ESPOSITO>波特的客户  富有的对冲基金经理  杰森·克科勒
<46-5,ESPOSITO>Potter did all the legal work to establish the super pac

698
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,570
<46-5,ESPOSITO>政坛人脉极广  创建了这个超级政治行动委员会
<46-5,ESPOSITO>for a client of his -- a wealthy hedge-fund manager

699
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:53,840
<46-5,ESPOSITO>波特帮他做了法律文件
<46-5,ESPOSITO>with significant political connections named Jason Kochler.

700
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,840
<46-6,RYAN>贩毒的钱被转进
<46-6,RYAN>It would appear as if drug money were being funneled

701
00:39:55,850 --> 00:39:57,920
<46-6,RYAN>未来期货账户上
<46-6,RYAN>into Future Forward's accounts.

702
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,150
<46-7,ESPOSITO>过去几个月共入账近一亿六千万美金
<46-7,ESPOSITO>Nearly $160 million in the past several months.

703
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:01,360
<46-8,RYAN>接下来这笔钱就通过一个
<46-8,RYAN>It was then legally laundered,

704
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,710
<46-8,RYAN>匿名的空壳公司和另一个秘密的超级政治委员会
<46-8,RYAN>passing through an anonymous shell corp

705
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:04,500
<46-8,RYAN>被合法地洗干净了
<46-8,RYAN>and second secret super pac.

706
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,120
<46-9,FOWLER>什么叫做"合法地洗干净"
<46-9,FOWLER>What do you mean "legally launded"?

707
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:07,900
<46-9,FOWLER>-这笔钱现在去哪了  -不见了
<46-9,FOWLER>- Where's that money now? - It's gone.

708
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,130
<46-10,ESPOSITO>规范这类型超级政治委员会的
<46-10,ESPOSITO>Federal tax and banking laws

709
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:10,810
<46-10,ESPOSITO>联邦税收和银行法
<46-10,ESPOSITO>that regulate these kind of super pacs

710
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:12,030
<46-10,ESPOSITO>使我们无法查出
<46-10,ESPOSITO>make it impossible for us to find out

711
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:13,920
<46-10,ESPOSITO>这笔钱的真实来源和去向
<46-10,ESPOSITO>where that money actually came from or went.

712
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:15,900
<46-11,CASTLE>肯定有人知道
<46-11,CASTLE>Well, someone must be able to tell us.

713
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:16,770
<46-11,CASTLE>伊万·波特
<46-11,CASTLE>Evan Potter.

714
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:18,750
<46-12,ESPOSITO>不  他只负责为克科勒成立这个组织
<46-12,ESPOSITO>No. He just set up the pac for Kochler.

715
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:19,650
<46-12,ESPOSITO>他不负责运营
<46-12,ESPOSITO>He didn't run it.

716
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:21,550
<46-13,GATES>那我们就得把杰森·克科勒抓来审审
<46-13,GATES>Then we need to bring Jason Kochler in here.

717
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:22,480
<46-13,GATES>不可能了
<46-13,GATES>We can't.

718
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:25,110
<46-14,RYAN>他今早心脏病去世了
<46-14,RYAN>He died of a heart attack this morning.

719
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:27,700
<46-15,BECKETT>所以你们才查不到那笔钱的去向
<46-15,BECKETT>That's why you couldn't find the money.

720
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:30,960
<46-15,BECKETT>有人用那笔钱建立了一个巨型政治筹措基金
<46-15,BECKETT>Someone's using it to build a massive political war chest.

721
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:31,840
<46-16,FOWLER>可是谁干的呢
<46-16,FOWLER>But who?

722
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:33,840
<46-17,ESPOSITO>我们是不可能查到的了
<46-17,ESPOSITO>It's impossible to know.

723
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:36,540
<47-1,SENATOR BRACKEN>认识我的人都知道
<47-1,SENATOR BRACKEN>Those of you who know me

724
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:38,470
<47-1,SENATOR BRACKEN>我能走到今天这一步全靠
<47-1,SENATOR BRACKEN>know that I've gotten where I am today

725
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:41,940
<47-1,SENATOR BRACKEN>我坚定不渝地完成需要的一切工作
<47-1,SENATOR BRACKEN>by doing whatever it takes to get the job done.

726
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,630
<47-1,SENATOR BRACKEN>这才是这个国家所需要的领导才能
<47-1,SENATOR BRACKEN>That is the kind of leadership this country needs,

727
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:47,810
<47-1,SENATOR BRACKEN>也正因这样  我现在正式成立竞选研究委员会
<47-1,SENATOR BRACKEN>and that is why I am forming an exploratory committee

728
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:48,460
<47-1,SENATOR BRACKEN>来筹备竞选美国总统的事宜
<47-1,SENATOR BRACKEN>for a run for the presidency of the United States.

730
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,610
<47-2,REPORTER>布莱肯议员  早期的领跑者
<47-2,REPORTER>Senator Bracken, an early front runner,

732
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,360
<47-2,REPORTER>据传已经收到了众多大型出资人
<47-2,REPORTER>is rumored to have significant funding

733
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:00,050
<47-2,REPORTER>提供的多笔巨额竞选基金
<47-2,REPORTER>already lined up from major contributors.

734
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,590
<47-3,BECKETT>他躲在瓦肯·西蒙斯背后
<47-3,BECKETT>Hiding behind Vulcan Simmons,

735
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:06,120
<47-3,BECKETT>用来路不明的钱资助自己竞选
<47-3,BECKETT>funding his campaign with dirty money,

736
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,740
<47-3,BECKETT>扫清一切路上遇到的障碍
<47-3,BECKETT>killing whoever gets in his way,

737
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:09,200
<47-3,BECKETT>就像他杀害我母亲那样
<47-3,BECKETT>just like he did with my mom.

738
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:11,430
<47-3,BECKETT>幕后黑手一定是他
<47-3,BECKETT>It's him.

739
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,600
<47-3,BECKETT>而我们却无法证实这一切
<47-3,BECKETT>And we have no way of proving it.

740
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,350
<47-4,CASTLE>也许联邦调查局会有所发现
<47-4,CASTLE>Maybe the feds will find something.

741
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:23,110
<47-5,BECKETT>不会的  布莱肯隐藏的太好了
<47-5,BECKETT>No. Bracken is so well-insulated.

742
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:24,590
<47-5,BECKETT>简直堪称是天才
<47-5,BECKETT>It's genius, actually.

743
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,960
<47-5,BECKETT>他搞到了自己所需要的所有竞选基金
<47-5,BECKETT>He has all the campaign funds that he needs

744
00:41:26,970 --> 00:41:29,100
<47-5,BECKETT>同时不需要欠任何带有个人目的的组织的人情
<47-5,BECKETT>without having to compromise or be beholden

745
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:30,940
<47-5,BECKETT>或是对他们做出任何妥协
<47-5,BECKETT>to any special-interest groups.

746
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:33,070
<47-6,CASTLE>但如果幕后黑手真的是他的话
<47-6,CASTLE>But if it really was him,

747
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:36,120
<47-6,CASTLE>他何不让你葬身在树林里呢
<47-6,CASTLE>why wouldn't he just let you die in the woods?

748
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,760
<47-6,CASTLE>他为什么要派伊莲娜去救你呢
<47-6,CASTLE>Why would he send Elena to save you?

749
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:41,280
<47-7,BECKETT>因为我去年破获暗杀行动的时候
<47-7,BECKETT>Because when I stopped the assassination last year,

750
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:42,700
<47-7,BECKETT>救了他一命
<47-7,BECKETT>I saved him.

751
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,480
<47-7,BECKETT>他说过他欠我的
<47-7,BECKETT>And he told me that he owed me.

752
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:48,040
<47-7,BECKETT>现在我们两清了
<47-7,BECKETT>And now we're even.

753
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,570
<47-7,BECKETT>所以下一次我们再见面的时候
<47-7,BECKETT>So the next time that we see each other...

754
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:05,930
<47-8,CASTLE>上床睡觉吧
<47-8,CASTLE>Come to bed.
