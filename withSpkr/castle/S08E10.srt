<4-15,BECKETT>抱歉  我还得要一阵
<4-15,BECKETT>Sorry, I'm gonna be a while.

00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,740
<1-2,RICHARD CASTLE>打扰  你知道还有别的...
<1-2,RICHARD CASTLE>Excuse me, do you know where there's another...

3
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,000
<1-3,CASTLE>谢谢  谢谢
<1-3,CASTLE>Ah, thank you. Thank you.

4
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:27,580
<2-1,CASTLE>住手
<2-1,CASTLE>Stop!

5
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:32,150
<2-2,CASTLE>天呐
<2-2,CASTLE>Oh, my god.

6
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:33,190
<2-2,CASTLE>桑迪
<2-2,CASTLE>Sadie.

7
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,040
<2-2,CASTLE>打911
<2-2,CASTLE>Call 911!

8
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:48,700
<2-2,CASTLE>打911
<2-2,CASTLE>Call 911!

10
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:04,410
<4-1,KATE BECKETT>里克  要有魅力  但别太过分了
<4-1,KATE BECKETT>Now, Rick, be charming but not too charming.

11
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:06,850
<4-2,CASTLE>这就像让超人别那么"超"
<4-2,CASTLE>That's like asking superman not to be too super.

12
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,240
<4-2,CASTLE>有魅力怎么了
<4-2,CASTLE>What's wrong with being too charming?

13
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,550
<4-3,BECKETT>没什么不好  只是为凶杀案作证时就不合适了
<4-3,BECKETT>Nothing, except when you are testifying in a murder trial.

14
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,940
<4-3,BECKETT>有魅力的人让陪审团觉得自信
<4-3,BECKETT>Look, being charming tells the jury that you're confident,

15
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,300
<4-3,BECKETT>但如果做过头
<4-3,BECKETT>But being too charming tells

16
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,810
<4-3,BECKETT>他们会觉得你想操控他们
<4-3,BECKETT>them that you're trying to be manipulative.

17
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:19,800
<4-4,CASTLE>我懂了  这就是你从不让我为我们的
<4-4,CASTLE>Oh, I see. This is why you never had me testify

18
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,340
<4-4,CASTLE>案子作证的原因
<4-4,CASTLE>in any of our cases.

19
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:22,760
<4-4,CASTLE>你是嫉妒我的魅力
<4-4,CASTLE>You're jealous of my charm.

20
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,580
<4-5,BECKETT>我是说真的  别自大
<4-5,BECKETT>I'm serious, okay? Don't get cocky.

21
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:26,710
<4-5,BECKETT>这是你第一次出庭作证
<4-5,BECKETT>This is the first time you'll be testifying in court,

22
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:28,210
<4-5,BECKETT>作证有时很让人紧张
<4-5,BECKETT>and it can get nerve-racking.

23
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:30,260
<4-6,CASTLE>我会没事的  尤其据传
<4-6,CASTLE>I'll be fine, especially since word on the street

24
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:32,720
<4-6,CASTLE>辩护律师根本没本事
<4-6,CASTLE>is the defense lawyer is a total hack.

25
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,230
<4-7,BECKETT>是吗  是谁
<4-7,BECKETT>Oh, yeah? Who is it?

26
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:35,390
<4-8,CASTLE>斯坦·诺瓦克
<4-8,CASTLE>Stan Novak.

27
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:37,150
<4-9,BECKETT>"精神集中不过三秒"斯坦吗
<4-9,BECKETT>"Short attention span" Stan?

28
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:39,760
<4-9,BECKETT>那人自己做盘问时都会找不到北
<4-9,BECKETT>That guy gets lost in his own cross examinations.

29
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,430
<4-9,BECKETT>嗯  那你会没事的
<4-9,BECKETT>Yeah. You will be fine.

32
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,130
<4-10,CASTLE>可惜你是没法看我作证了
<4-10,CASTLE>Too bad you won't be there to see me in action.

33
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,100
<4-11,BECKETT>-我会去的  -那样好吗
<4-11,BECKETT>- No, but I will. - Is that wise?

35
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,440
<4-12,CASTLE>我们明面上还是分手状态啊
<4-12,CASTLE>I mean, publicly, aren't we still supposed to be separated?

36
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,090
<4-13,BECKETT>这可是桑迪·比克曼的凶案审判
<4-13,BECKETT>This is the Sadie Beakman murder trial we're talking about.

38
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:52,780
<4-13,BECKETT>她的伊拉克报导
<4-13,BECKETT>Her reporting from Iraq

39
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,930
<4-13,BECKETT>成就了很多美国人对伊战的看法
<4-13,BECKETT>shaped the way many Americans saw the war.

40
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:57,910
<4-13,BECKETT>而且这还让她得以创办自己的网站
<4-13,BECKETT>Plus it gave her the profile to launch her own news website.

42
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:01,670
<4-13,BECKETT>作为为她的凶杀案结案的分局警监
<4-13,BECKETT>And as captain of the precinct that closed her murder case,

44
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:03,200
<4-13,BECKETT>如果我不去才奇怪呢
<4-13,BECKETT>it would be odd if I didn't show.

45
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,750
<4-14,CASTLE>那我们就该想个秘密信号
<4-14,CASTLE>Then we should come up with a secret signal.

47
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,870
<4-14,CASTLE>我们的暗号  来表明
<4-14,CASTLE>A little thing just between the two of us that says,

48
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,530
<4-14,CASTLE>"我爱你"
<4-14,CASTLE>"I love you."

49
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,550
<4-15,BECKETT>我觉得那就有点...
<4-15,BECKETT>Oh, you know, I think that would be a little...

51
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:12,760
<4-15,BECKETT>-你需要纸巾吗  -不是
<4-15,BECKETT>- Do you need a tissue? - No,

52
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,400
<4-16,CASTLE>这是我的秘密"我爱你"手势
<4-16,CASTLE>this is my... that's the secret "I love you" signal.

53
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,970
<4-17,BECKETT>-喜欢吗  -摸鼻子吗
<4-17,BECKETT>- Do you like it? - Rubbing your nose?

54
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,830
<4-19,BECKETT>-嗯  -是啊  真浪漫
<4-19,BECKETT>- Yeah. - Yeah, that's really romantic.

55
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:19,330
<4-19,BECKETT>总之  我得走了
<4-19,BECKETT>Anyway, I got to go.

56
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,950
<4-19,BECKETT>我要去见维克拉姆  回头庭上见
<4-19,BECKETT>I'm meeting Vikram. I'll see you at the court.

57
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,420
<4-19,BECKETT>我也爱你
<4-19,BECKETT>Yes, I love you, too.

58
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,900
<5-3,BECKETT>监视卡莱布·布朗
<5-3,BECKETT>Where are we on surveilling Caleb Brown

59
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,200
<5-3,BECKETT>将他与洛克塞特联系起来进展如何
<5-3,BECKETT>and connecting him to LokSat?

60
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:35,130
<5-4,VIKRAM>跟上周
<5-4,VIKRAM>Exactly where we were last week

61
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:37,370
<5-4,VIKRAM>上上周  上上上周的情况一样
<5-4,VIKRAM>and the week before that and the week before that.

62
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:38,320
<5-5,BECKETT>就是毫无进展吗
<5-5,BECKETT>So nowhere?

63
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,210
<5-6,VIKRAM>我们公设辩护人办公室的那位目标
<5-6,VIKRAM>Our target at the public defender's office

64
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,240
<5-6,VIKRAM>就像个超级反派  没有弱点
<5-6,VIKRAM>is like a super villain... no weaknesses.

65
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,620
<5-7,BECKETT>得了  那是不可能的
<5-7,BECKETT>Oh, come on. That's not possible.

66
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,690
<5-8,VIKRAM>是吗  因为我和茜茜已经试过了
<5-8,VIKRAM>Sure about that? 'cause Cee Cee and I have tried every pos--

67
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:48,890
<5-10,VIKRAM>-等等  什么  茜茜是谁  -没谁
<5-10,VIKRAM>- Wait, what? Who's Cee Cee? - No one.

68
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,820
<5-11,BECKETT>你是给你的电脑起了个女生名字吗
<5-11,BECKETT>Did you give your computer a girl's name?

69
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,220
<5-12,VIKRAM>你不了解我的生活
<5-12,VIKRAM>You don't know my life.

70
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:56,040
<5-13,BECKETT>此前我从未为此感到如此庆幸呢
<5-13,BECKETT>I've never been happier about that until this moment.

71
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,820
<5-13,BECKETT>我受够了跟大家撒谎
<5-13,BECKETT>Look, I am tired of lying to everyone.

72
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:58,560
<5-13,BECKETT>我想要回我的生活
<5-13,BECKETT>I want my life back,

73
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,630
<5-13,BECKETT>鉴于你都跟你的电脑发展恋情了
<5-13,BECKETT>and given your new relationship with your computer,

74
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,580
<5-13,BECKETT>你也需要回归自己的生活了
<5-13,BECKETT>it's time you get yours back, too.

75
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:06,430
<5-13,BECKETT>我们赶紧想出卡莱布·布朗的弱点吧
<5-13,BECKETT>So let's figure this out. What is Caleb Brown's weakness?

76
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:10,010
<6-1,MARCUS WELLER>这将是我参与过的最简单的案子
<6-1,MARCUS WELLER>This is gonna be the easiest case I have ever tried.

77
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,050
<6-2,CASTLE>你为什么如此肯定
<6-2,CASTLE>How can you be so sure?

78
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:12,770
<6-3,WELLER>被告有一堆逮捕记录
<6-3,WELLER>The defendant has a history of arrest

79
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:15,780
<6-3,WELLER>全是因为扮成酒席承包人抢劫高端住宅
<6-3,WELLER>for robbing high-end houses while working as a cater waiter.

80
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,400
<6-3,WELLER>桑迪·比克曼抓了她个现行
<6-3,WELLER>Sadie Beakman caught her in the act

81
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,850
<6-3,WELLER>被告为逃跑而杀了她
<6-3,WELLER>and the defendant killed her in order to get away.

82
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:21,490
<6-4,CASTLE>这不都是只有旁证推测吗
<6-4,CASTLE>Isn't that all circumstantial?

83
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:23,840
<6-5,WELLER>是的  所以幸好我有你
<6-5,WELLER>Yes, which is why it's a good thing I have you...

84
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,190
<6-5,WELLER>一名目击证人
<6-5,WELLER>an eyewitness.

85
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,730
<6-5,WELLER>被告真的该接受我提出的认罪协议的
<6-5,WELLER>The defendant really should've taken that plea deal I offered.

86
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:29,010
<6-6,CASTLE>是啊  她为什么没接受
<6-6,CASTLE>Yeah. Why didn't she?

87
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:30,500
<6-6,CASTLE>你觉得他们会如何抗辩
<6-6,CASTLE>What do you think their defense is gonna be?

88
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,940
<6-7,WELLER>别去想那个
<6-7,WELLER>Don't concern yourself with that.

89
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,910
<6-7,WELLER>不管他要如何扭曲事实
<6-7,WELLER>No matter how he tries to spin the facts,

90
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,340
<6-7,WELLER>你要坚持陈述自己所看到的
<6-7,WELLER>you stick with what you saw.

91
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:37,160
<6-8,CASTLE>妮娜·奥基弗杀了桑迪·比克曼
<6-8,CASTLE>Nina O'Keefe killed Sadie Beakman.

92
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,000
<6-9,WELLER>这是被害人的家庭
<6-9,WELLER>The victim's family.

93
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,500
<6-10,CASTLE>是啊  我记得
<6-10,CASTLE>Oh, yes, I remember.

94
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:42,220
<6-10,CASTLE>很高兴再见到你们
<6-10,CASTLE>Nice to see you again.

95
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,440
<6-10,CASTLE>很抱歉是因为这样的事
<6-10,CASTLE>Sorry it's under such terrible circumstances.

96
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,720
<6-11,ANNIE BEAKMAN>是啊  我们也是
<6-11,ANNIE BEAKMAN>Yeah. Us, too.

97
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,180
<6-12,CASTLE>你们还好吗
<6-12,CASTLE>So, how are you holding up?

98
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,990
<6-13,LLOYD BEAKMAN>有时还好  但更多时候不好
<6-13,LLOYD BEAKMAN>Some good days, more bad.

99
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:50,950
<6-13,LLOYD BEAKMAN>我们似乎无法翻篇
<6-13,LLOYD BEAKMAN>We can't seem to get over it.

100
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,460
<6-13,LLOYD BEAKMAN>我妻子在伊拉克跟部队
<6-13,LLOYD BEAKMAN>You know, my wife spent two years embedded

101
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,310
<6-13,LLOYD BEAKMAN>潜伏了两年都毫发无伤
<6-13,LLOYD BEAKMAN>with troops in Iraq and not a scratch.

102
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:57,160
<6-13,LLOYD BEAKMAN>却死在曼哈顿一个派对上  真是没道理
<6-13,LLOYD BEAKMAN>And then a party in Manhattan. Doesn't make sense.

103
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,270
<6-14,CASTLE>我们会为她主持正义的
<6-14,CASTLE>Well, we're gonna get her justice.

104
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:13,930
<7-2,WELLER>-马库斯  -你来了太好了  警监
<7-2,WELLER>- Marcus. - Hey. Glad you could make it, captain.

105
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:16,970
<7-3,BECKETT>我怎么听说你约会蕾妮了
<7-3,BECKETT>So, um, what is this I hear about you asking Lanie out?

106
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:18,490
<7-4,WELLER>不不  你误会了
<7-4,WELLER>No, no, no, no. You got that wrong.

107
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:19,780
<7-4,WELLER>是蕾妮约的我
<7-4,WELLER>Lanie asked me.

108
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:21,500
<7-5,BECKETT>真的吗  我...
<7-5,BECKETT>Really? That's what I...

109

215
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,930
<23-4,BROWN>首先  我的委托人
<23-4,BROWN>First... is it possible

216
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:30,500
<23-4,BROWN>是否可能没有杀害比克曼太太
<23-4,BROWN>that my client did not kill Mrs. Beakman?

217
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,210
<23-5,CASTLE>不可能  绝对是她
<23-5,CASTLE>Oh, no. It was definitely her.

218
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,360
<23-6,BROWN>你对当晚的事件记得很清楚吗
<23-6,BROWN>And you remember the events of the evening clearly?

219
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,080
<23-6,BROWN>因为  我知道你有失忆史
<23-6,BROWN>Because I know that you have a history of memory loss.

220
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,280
<23-8,BROWN>-反对  法官大人  -这事关可信度
<23-8,BROWN>- Objection, your honor. - Goes to credibility.

221
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,650
<23-9,JUDGE WOLLCOTT>反对无效
<23-9,JUDGE WOLLCOTT>I'll allow it.

222
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:47,110
<23-10,BROWN>卡塞尔先生  2014年5月12日
<23-10,BROWN>Mr. Castle, is it true that on May 12, 2014,

223
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,940
<23-10,BROWN>你是否曾被至今未查明的人绑架
<23-10,BROWN>you were abducted by parties still unknown

224
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:52,130
<23-10,BROWN>8周后才又出现
<23-10,BROWN>and then returned 8 weeks later?

225
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,650
<23-11,CASTLE>是的
<23-11,CASTLE>Yes.

226
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,390
<23-12,BROWN>而且你依然失着忆
<23-12,BROWN>And you still have memory loss?

227
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:57,480
<23-13,CASTLE>只对那8周失了忆
<23-13,CASTLE>Only of those eight weeks.

228
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:00,970
<23-13,CASTLE>我对你委托人杀害比克曼太太的记忆十分清晰
<23-13,CASTLE>My memory of your client killing Mrs. Beakman is crystal clear.

229
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,730
<23-14,BROWN>你怎么可能确定呢
<23-14,BROWN>But how can you be sure?

230
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:04,260
<23-15,CASTLE>因为我是目击证人
<23-15,CASTLE>Because I was an eyewitness.

231
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,480
<23-16,BROWN>很高兴你用了这个词
<23-16,BROWN>So glad that you used that word.

232
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:08,130
<23-15,CASTLE>目击证人
<23-15,CASTLE>Eyewitness.

233
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,880
<24-2,JUDGE WOLLCOTT>卡塞尔先生
<24-2,JUDGE WOLLCOTT>Now, Mr. Castle,

234
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:13,250
<23-16,BROWN>你在案发当晚曾诵读
<23-16,BROWN>you gave a reading of "Driving Heat"

235
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,660
<23-16,BROWN>《希特袭来》
<23-16,BROWN>on the evening in question,

236
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,690
<23-16,BROWN>这是妮基·希特系列的新书
<23-16,BROWN>the continuing adventures of Nikki Heat.

237
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:19,280
<23-16,BROWN>能否为庭上读一小段
<23-16,BROWN>Might you humor the court and just give us a short reading?

238
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:22,390
<23-16,BROWN>就读高亮的部分即可  麻烦了
<23-16,BROWN>Just the highlighted section, if you please.

239
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,460
<23-17,CASTLE>"妮基以及每个警察都经常会见到
<23-17,CASTLE>"Nikki had seen it often, as every cop had.

240
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,010
<23-17,CASTLE>本来很可靠的目击证人
<23-17,CASTLE>otherwise-reliable eyewitnesses

241
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:34,250
<23-17,CASTLE>搞错或搞混在那些没有
<23-17,CASTLE>conflate or confuse details that seem indelible

242
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:37,360
<23-17,CASTLE>因事件产生创伤的人眼里不可磨灭的细节"
<23-17,CASTLE>to those not caught up in the trauma of the incident."

243
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,280
<23-18,BROWN>据之前的证词
<23-18,BROWN>According to previous testimony,

244
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,680
<23-18,BROWN>你凭你在纽约警局的经验
<23-18,BROWN>you use your expertise with the NYPD

245
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,260
<23-18,BROWN>为你的小说增添真实性
<23-18,BROWN>to add authenticity to your stories.

246
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,140
<23-18,BROWN>是吗
<23-18,BROWN>Is that correct?

247
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,960
<23-19,CASTLE>被告杀了比克曼太太
<23-19,CASTLE>The defendant killed Mrs. Beakman.

248
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,040
<23-19,CASTLE>我清楚我看到了什么
<23-19,CASTLE>I know what I saw.

249
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,550
<23-20,BROWN>那么你2015年2月2日也清楚自己看到了什么吗
<23-20,BROWN>Just like you knew what you saw on February 2, 2015?

250
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:57,170
<23-21,BROWN>卡塞尔先生  你是否曾向
<23-21,BROWN>Mr. Castle, did you give a statement

251
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:59,730
<23-21,BROWN>韦斯切斯特警局的尼利警探作证说
<23-21,BROWN>to a Detective Neely of Westchester P.D.

252
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:02,370
<23-21,BROWN>你目睹了伊娃·威特福德的被杀
<23-21,BROWN>that you were an eyewitness to the murder of Eva Whitfield

253
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:04,720
<23-21,BROWN>-而她丈夫科尔是凶手  -是的
<23-21,BROWN>- and that her husband, Cole, was the killer? - Yes, I did...

254
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,660
<23-23,BROWN>-那么科尔·威特福德是凶手吗  -不是
<23-23,BROWN>- And was Cole Whitfield the killer? - No.

255
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,640
<23-25,BROWN>那么你以前就错过
<23-25,BROWN>So you've been wrong before.

256
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,410
<23-26,CASTLE>那次事件是个陷阱
<23-26,CASTLE>That incident was a setup.

257
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,230
<23-26,CASTLE>而比克曼太太的遭遇并非如此
<23-26,CASTLE>What happened to Mrs. Beakman was not.

258
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,730
<23-26,CASTLE>我看到被告杀人了
<23-26,CASTLE>I saw the defendant kill her.

259
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:17,800
<23-27,BROWN>而此人自己的书中
<23-27,BROWN>Says the man whose own writings

260
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,970
<23-27,BROWN>也提到了目击证人的不可靠性
<23-27,BROWN>speak to the unreliability of eyewitnesses,

261
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:23,950
<23-27,BROWN>而且此人过去曾提供过不实证词
<23-27,BROWN>a man who has given false eyewitness statements in the past,

262
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:27,290
<23-27,BROWN>还有  此人有失忆史
<23-27,BROWN>a man with a history of memory loss.

263
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,160
<23-29,WELLER>-马库斯  帮帮他  -如果我能怎么会不帮
<23-29,WELLER>- Marcus...help him. - Don't you think I would if I could?

264
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,210
<24-2,JUDGE WOLLCOTT>卡塞尔先生  我们假装
<24-2,JUDGE WOLLCOTT>Mr. Castle, let's pretend

265
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:36,570
<23-30,BROWN>你是你小说的一个人物
<23-30,BROWN>that you're a character out of one of your novels.

266
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:39,120
<23-30,BROWN>那么妮基·希特会认为你是可靠目击证人吗
<23-30,BROWN>Would Nikki Heat think that you were a reliable witness?

267
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:42,030
<23-31,CASTLE>这个问题太可笑了  她当然会信任我
<23-31,CASTLE>That is a ridiculous question, and yes, she would.

268
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,740
<23-32,BROWN>我真对你失望  卡塞尔先生
<23-32,BROWN>I'm disappointed in you, Mr. Castle.

269
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:44,720
<23-32,BROWN>我以为你是最会
<23-32,BROWN>I thought you of all people

270
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,670
<23-32,BROWN>对我的委托人产生同情的
<23-32,BROWN>would be sympathetic to my client.

271
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:49,130
<23-32,BROWN>你自己不就曾被陷害犯下谋杀吗
<23-32,BROWN>Weren't you once framed for murder?

272
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:55,240
<23-33,CASTLE>那是3XK  是个连环杀手
<23-33,CASTLE>That... yeah, that was 3XK, the serial killer.

273
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,660
<23-33,CASTLE>他是跟我有仇
<23-33,CASTLE>He had a vendetta against me.

274
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,870
<23-33,CASTLE>那根本是另一码事
<23-33,CASTLE>That... that was... that was different.

275
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,860
<23-34,BROWN>为什么对你就是另一码事  对我委托人就不是
<23-34,BROWN>W-why is it different for you but not for my client?

276
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:04,220
<23-34,BROWN>你凭什么那么特别  卡塞尔先生
<23-34,BROWN>What makes you so special, Mr. Castle?

277
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,190
<23-34,BROWN>帕里什医生证实被害人比克曼太太
<23-34,BROWN>Dr. Parish testified that the victim, Mrs. Beakman,

278
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:10,840
<23-34,BROWN>遇刺后还活了5到10分钟
<23-34,BROWN>was alive for 5 to 10 minutes after being stabbed

279
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,240
<23-34,BROWN>而且当时十分痛苦
<23-34,BROWN>and in excruciating pain.

280
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:16,870
<23-34,BROWN>或许我的委托人只是撞见了被害人
<23-34,BROWN>Might it be that my client simply came across the victim

281
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:19,590
<23-34,BROWN>而真凶刺伤她后已经逃逸
<23-34,BROWN>after the true killer stabbed her and fled?

282
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:21,860
<23-36,BROWN>-但那...  -这可不是你的小说  先生
<23-36,BROWN>- But that... - This is not one of your stories, sir!

283
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:24,600
<23-36,BROWN>你不能随你心意编造事实
<23-36,BROWN>You do not get to make up the facts as you see fit.

284
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,840
<23-36,BROWN>我的委托人在为她的人生争取
<23-36,BROWN>Now, my client is fighting for her life

285
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,240
<23-36,BROWN>就像你曾与3XK斗争那样
<23-36,BROWN>just as you once fought for yours against 3XK.

286
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:33,650
<23-36,BROWN>那么我再问你一次  卡塞尔先生  我委托人
<23-36,BROWN>So, now I ask you one last time, is it possible, Mr. Castle,

287
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:37,340
<23-36,BROWN>是否可能并没杀比克曼太太
<23-36,BROWN>that my client did not kill Mrs. Beakman?

288
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,230
<23-37,CASTLE>有可能的
<23-37,CASTLE>Yes, it's possible. Yes.

289
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:46,910
<23-38,BROWN>是有可能  你有可能错了
<23-38,BROWN>Yes, it is possible. Possible that you are wrong.

290
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:48,810
<23-38,BROWN>没有别的问题了  法官大人
<23-38,BROWN>Nothing further, your honor.

291
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,820
<23-39,JUDGE WOLLCOTT>卡塞尔先生  你可以退下了
<23-39,JUDGE WOLLCOTT>Mr. Castle, you may step down.

301
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:06,130
<23-39,JUDGE WOLLCOTT>卡塞尔先生  你可以退下了
<23-39,JUDGE WOLLCOTT>Mr. Castle, you may step down.

302
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:11,390
<24-2,JUDGE WOLLCOTT>卡塞尔先生
<24-2,JUDGE WOLLCOTT>Mr. Castle.

303
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,120
<24-2,JUDGE WOLLCOTT>退下吧
<24-2,JUDGE WOLLCOTT>Step down.

304
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,250
<24-3,JUDGE WOLLCOTT>都快5点了
<24-3,JUDGE WOLLCOTT>It's nearly 5:00.

305
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,870
<24-3,JUDGE WOLLCOTT>我们明天继续
<24-3,JUDGE WOLLCOTT>We will pick this back up in the morning.

306
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:24,240
<24-3,JUDGE WOLLCOTT>法庭明天上午9点重新开庭
<24-3,JUDGE WOLLCOTT>Court is in recess until 9:00 a.m.

307
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,170
<25-1,WELLER>过来
<25-1,WELLER>Come here.

308
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,670
<25-2,CASTLE>马库斯  我很抱歉  我不知道怎么回事
<25-2,CASTLE>Marcus, I'm so sorry. I don't know what happened.

309
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,710
<25-3,WELLER>-我被偷袭了  -不不
<25-3,WELLER>- I got torpedoed. - No, no, no, no.

310
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:42,070
<25-3,WELLER>你是被抹杀了
<25-3,WELLER>You got nuked.

311
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,110
<25-4,BECKETT>你没事吧
<25-4,BECKETT>Are you okay?

312
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:47,240
<25-5,CASTLE>贝克特  我刚刚毁了整个案子
<25-5,CASTLE>Beckett, I just blew the entire case.

313
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:50,120
<25-6,BECKETT>庭审还没结束呢  是吧马库斯
<25-6,BECKETT>Well, the trial's not over yet, right, Marcus?

314
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,410
<25-7,WELLER>我不骗你  我们现在麻烦大了
<25-7,WELLER>Look, I'm not gonna lie to you. We got a serious problem now.

315
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:55,010
<25-7,WELLER>卡塞尔  你刚刚给了陪审团合理怀疑
<25-7,WELLER>Castle, you've just given the jury reasonable doubt.

316
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:57,000
<25-8,CASTLE>但我们还能做点什么的吧
<25-8,CASTLE>But there's got to be something we can do, right?

317
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,780
<25-9,BECKETT>我们得在法庭明早重新开庭前
<25-9,BECKETT>Well, we have until court resumes tomorrow morning

318
00:12:58,780 --> 00:12:59,730
<25-9,BECKETT>找到新证据
<25-9,BECKETT>to find new evidence

319
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:01,960
<25-9,BECKETT>或其他目击证人证明妮娜有罪
<25-9,BECKETT>or another witness who can prove Nina's guilt.

320
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,950
<25-10,WELLER>是啊  但你能在不到16小时内
<25-10,WELLER>Yes. However, what can you possibly uncover

321
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,330
<25-10,WELLER>找到什么啊
<25-10,WELLER>in less than 16 hours?

322
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:07,790
<25-11,BECKETT>我不知道  但我们得一试
<25-11,BECKETT>I don't know. But we have to try.

323
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:12,650
<26-1,ESPOSITO>我们还要再翻几次案卷啊
<26-1,ESPOSITO>How many more times do we have to go through these case files?

324
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:14,220
<26-2,BECKETT>需要多少次就多少次
<26-2,BECKETT>As many as it takes.

325
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,960
<26-3,RYAN>贝克特  我们这里有汪洋大海却没有针
<26-3,RYAN>Beckett, we got stacks and stacks of hay here but no needles.

326
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,510
<26-3,RYAN>我们得换个策略
<26-3,RYAN>I think we need a new strategy.

327
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,440
<26-4,CASTLE>我真不敢相信我搞砸得多严重
<26-4,CASTLE>I can't believe how badly I blew it out there.

328
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,200
<26-4,CASTLE>这都怪我  各位  对不起
<26-4,CASTLE>This is my fault, guys. I'm sorry.

329
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,200
<26-5,RYAN>别那么责怪自己
<26-5,RYAN>Don't do that to yourself.

330
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,130
<26-5,RYAN>我们都在证人席上栽过跟头
<26-5,RYAN>We've all been tripped up on the witness stand.

331
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:28,950
<26-6,ESPOSITO>是啊  我做警员时
<26-6,ESPOSITO>True. Back when I was in uniform,

332
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:31,270
<26-6,ESPOSITO>一个辩护律师把我整得五迷三道
<26-6,ESPOSITO>a defense attorney got my head so turned around

333
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:33,540
<26-6,ESPOSITO>我居然作证说我逮捕被告时
<26-6,ESPOSITO>that I testified the defendant actually kicked my ass

334
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:34,800
<26-6,ESPOSITO>被她踢了屁股
<26-6,ESPOSITO>when I tried to arrest her.

335
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,200
<26-7,CASTLE>这有什么不对
<26-7,CASTLE>What's wrong with that?

336
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,600
<26-8,ESPOSITO>被告是个75岁坐轮椅的老太太
<26-8,ESPOSITO>The defendant was a 75-year-old woman in a wheelchair.

337
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:43,360
<26-8,ESPOSITO>我在陪审团面前信誉扫地
<26-8,ESPOSITO>I lost all credibility with the jury.

338
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:46,720
<26-9,RYAN>直至今日  我们经过她喂鸟的公园
<26-9,RYAN>To this day, we pass the park where she feeds the birds,

339
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,260
<26-9,RYAN>她还会偷笑  跟她的护工讲述
<26-9,RYAN>she snickers, turns to her nurse, and tells her the tale

340
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,330
<26-9,RYAN>她当年拿下我们可怜哈维的故事
<26-9,RYAN>of how she got one over on poor old Javi.

341
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,820
<26-10,ESPOSITO>露辛达女士  我总有一天能逮到她
<26-10,ESPOSITO>Ms. Lucinda... I will get her one day.

342
00:13:56,340 --> 00:14:00,550
<26-11,CASTLE>但你们有人在谋杀案庭审中搞砸过吗
<26-11,CASTLE>But have any of you botched your testimony in a murder trial?

343
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,060
<26-11,CASTLE>是啊
<26-11,CASTLE>Exactly.

344
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,820
<26-12,BECKETT>埃斯波  那个露辛达女士的故事
<26-12,BECKETT>Hey, Espo, that story about Ms. Lucinda...

345
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,760
<26-12,BECKETT>她到现在还会谈论她让你出丑的故事吗
<26-12,BECKETT>so she still talks about how she made a fool out of you.

346
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,530
<26-13,ESPOSITO>是啊  多谢你给伤口撒盐了  贝克特警监
<26-13,ESPOSITO>Yes. Thank you for rubbing it in, Captain Beckett.

347
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:15,970
<26-14,BECKETT>各位  我们的策略错了
<26-14,BECKETT>You guys, we're approaching this wrong.

348
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:18,240
<26-14,BECKETT>我们一直在找凶案当时的线索
<26-14,BECKETT>I mean, we've been trying to find a clue from the murder,

349
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,550
<26-14,BECKETT>而我们应该找凶案发生后的线索
<26-14,BECKETT>whereas we should be looking for a clue from after the murder.

350
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:25,320
<26-15,CASTLE>是啊  妮娜被捕后就一直被关押
<26-15,CASTLE>Yes. Nina's been held since her arrest.

351
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,450
<26-15,CASTLE>她或许跟狱友吐露过什么
<26-15,CASTLE>She might've confessed something to a cellmate.

352
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:29,290
<26-16,BECKETT>我们去把她狱友接来吧
<26-16,BECKETT>Let's bring Nina's cellmate in.

353
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,700
<26-17,CASTLE>谢谢你
<26-17,CASTLE>Hey, thank you.

354
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:33,900
<26-18,BECKETT>谢什么
<26-18,BECKETT>For what?

355
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,370
<26-19,CASTLE>没有放弃我
<26-19,CASTLE>For not giving up on me.

356
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,800
<26-20,BECKETT>你也从没放弃过我  所以
<26-20,BECKETT>Well, you've never given up on me, so...

00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,480
<26-22,CASTLE>对了  我们分居呢

<26-23,BECKETT>Are you okay? Do you have allergies?

361
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:48,410
<26-24,CASTLE>不  那是...那个手势
<26-24,CASTLE>No, that's the... that's the signal. That's the...

362
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:51,520
<26-25,BECKETT>对了  你真的该想个更好的
<26-25,BECKETT>Oh, yes. You really should think of something better.

<27-1,BRIDGET>You know, in my mug shot, I look like a train wreck.

367
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,640
<27-1,BRIDGET>大概是因为我当时嗑可卡因嗑嗨了
<27-1,BRIDGET>Probably because I was high on crack at the time.

<27-7,RYAN>让凶手伏法的满足感吗
<27-7,RYAN>The personal satisfaction of bringing a killer to justice?

375
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:23,650
<27-8,BRIDGET>接下来10周
<27-8,BRIDGET>50 bucks in my prison

00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:31,370
<27-11,ESPOSITO>成交  你最好有货真价实的情报
<27-11,ESPOSITO>Deal. But you better have some solid information.

380
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,620
<27-11,ESPOSITO>说吧  妮娜认罪了吗
<27-11,ESPOSITO>Now, has Nina confessed to the murder?

381
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,320
<27-11,ESPOSITO>没有
<27-11,ESPOSITO>No.

00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:36,690
<27-12,BRIDGET>但我知道是她干的
<27-12,BRIDGET>But I know she did it.

383
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,910
<27-12,BRIDGET>妮娜是这样的
<27-12,BRIDGET>Look, here's the deal with Nina.

384
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:40,900
<27-12,BRIDGET>她是只老鼠  不怎么说话
<27-12,BRIDGET>She's a mouse. Doesn't talk much.

385
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:42,520
<27-12,BRIDGET>然后有一天  她说出她担心
<27-12,BRIDGET>Then one day she lets slip she's worried

386
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,520
<27-12,BRIDGET>公诉方会发现她的秘密
<27-12,BRIDGET>the prosecution might find out about her secret.

<27-13,RYAN>-什么秘密  -没说
<27-13,RYAN>- What secret? - Didn't say.

388
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:49,500

<27-14,BRIDGET>I think it has to do with her boyfriend or something.

389
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,270
<27-15,RYAN>什么男友
<27-15,RYAN>What boyfriend?

393
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:00,180
<29-1,CASTLE>妮娜被捕时在跟谁约会
<29-1,CASTLE>who Nina was dating when she was arrested.

394
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,390
<29-1,CASTLE>我是否跟警方是一伙儿的
<29-1,CASTLE>Am I working with the police?

00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:03,580
<29-1,CASTLE>-别认  -不不

00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:12,630

<29-4,ESPOSITO>None of Nina's people

400

<29-4,ESPOSITO>是不会帮我们立案起诉她的
<29-4,ESPOSITO>are gonna help us build a case against her.

401
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,360
<29-4,ESPOSITO>我们得另想办法确认
<29-4,ESPOSITO>We're gonna have to figure out a different way

402
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,910
<29-5,CASTLE>妮娜男友的身份了
<29-5,CASTLE>to identify Nina's boyfriend.

403
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:19,180
<29-6,RYAN>我做到了  跟我来
<29-6,RYAN>I just did. Follow me.

404
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:21,250
<29-6,RYAN>我去查了妮娜的账
<29-6,RYAN>So, I went through Nina's financials.

405
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,510
<29-6,RYAN>凶案前一晚
<29-6,RYAN>It turns out the night before the murder,

406
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,610
<29-6,RYAN>妮娜在东格林威治一家酒吧买了酒
<29-6,RYAN>Nina bought drinks at a bar on the east village.

407
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,060
<29-6,RYAN>这家酒吧已经倒闭了
<29-6,RYAN>Now, that bar went out of business.

408
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,900
<29-6,RYAN>但隔壁的酒店
<29-6,RYAN>However, the hotel next door

409
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:33,740
<29-6,RYAN>有当晚的监控录像
<29-6,RYAN>had surveillance footage from that night.

410
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:34,680
<29-6,RYAN>看
<29-6,RYAN>Look.

411
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:38,160
<30-1,RYAN>记住  这是妮娜杀桑迪的前一晚
<30-1,RYAN>Now, bear in mind, this is the night before Nina killed Sadie.

412
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,790
<30-3,CASTLE>-妮娜来了  -妮娜的男友在里面吗
<30-3,CASTLE>- There's Nina. - Is Nina's boyfriend in this?

413
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:43,330
<30-4,RYAN>不是她男友  等着
<30-4,RYAN>Not her boyfriend. Wait for it.

414
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,750
<30-5,RYAN>是女友
<30-5,RYAN>Her girlfriend.

415
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:47,530
<30-6,CASTLE>桑迪
<30-6,CASTLE>Sadie!

416
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:48,950
<30-7,RYAN>是的
<30-7,RYAN>Yep.

417
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:55,520
<30-8,CASTLE>被害人和凶手有私情
<30-8,CASTLE>The victim and the killer were having an affair?!

418
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:57,680
<30-8,CASTLE>我的声音怎么尖了
<30-8,CASTLE>Why is my voice so high?

419
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,450
<31-1,WELLER>瞧  贝克特
<31-1,WELLER>You see, Beckett?

420
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,510
<31-1,WELLER>这就是我喜欢12分局的地方
<31-1,WELLER>This is why I love the 12th precinct.

421
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:12,010
<31-1,WELLER>你们从不让我失望
<31-1,WELLER>You guys never let me down.

422
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:13,800
<31-2,BECKETT>这段视频是凶案的新动机
<31-2,BECKETT>This recording gives you new motive for murder,

423
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,220
<31-2,BECKETT>而且铁证如山
<31-2,BECKETT>and it's ironclad.

424
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,930
<31-2,BECKETT>妮娜和桑迪有私情
<31-2,BECKETT>Nina and Sadie were having an affair.

425
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:18,600
<31-2,BECKETT>她们显然起了争执
<31-2,BECKETT>Clearly, they were fighting,

426
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,710
<31-2,BECKETT>妮娜很可能是激情犯罪了
<31-2,BECKETT>and Nina most likely killed her in a crime of passion.

427
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:23,670
<31-3,WELLER>好了  我会叫我的人
<31-3,WELLER>Okay. I will have my people track down

428
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:25,510
<31-3,WELLER>找到酒吧的前雇员
<31-3,WELLER>former employees of this bar,

429
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,940
<31-3,WELLER>希望其中有人能证实私情的事
<31-3,WELLER>and hopefully one of them can corroborate the affair.

430
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:28,900
<31-4,BECKETT>好  我会让我的人
<31-4,BECKETT>Okay, and I'll have my team

431
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,510
<31-4,BECKETT>跟桑迪的家人朋友联系
<31-4,BECKETT>touch base with Sadie's family and friends.

432
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:31,440
<31-4,BECKETT>或许他们了解
<31-4,BECKETT>Maybe they can shed some light

433
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,430
<31-4,BECKETT>这段私情背后的内幕
<31-4,BECKETT>as to what was behind this little love affair.

434
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,240
<32-1,CASTLE>瞧  马库斯  你还担心呢
<32-1,CASTLE>You see, Marcus? And you were worried.

435
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:46,370
<32-2,BECKETT>好了  各位  我们找到妮娜的棺材了
<32-2,BECKETT>Okay, boys, we found Nina's coffin.

436
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,280
<32-2,BECKETT>现在我们去给她钉死在里面吧
<32-2,BECKETT>Now let's nail it shut.

437
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,840
<32-3,ESPOSITO>我去跟妮娜的雇员谈谈
<32-3,ESPOSITO>I'll talk to Nina's employees.

438
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,260
<32-4,RYAN>我去找她朋友问话
<32-4,RYAN>I'll go talk with her friends.

439
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,930
<32-4,RYAN>桑迪在跟那女人出轨
<32-4,RYAN>Sadie was having an affair with that woman?

440
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:00,480
<33-1,ROGER>这太扭曲了
<33-1,ROGER>That is so twisted.

441
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,900
<33-2,JOANNA>关起来的门后是什么样谁都不清楚
<33-2,JOANNA>Well, you never know what goes on behind closed doors.

442
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,740
<33-3,RYAN>那么你们对桑迪的婚外情毫不知情吗
<33-3,RYAN>So you knew nothing about Sadie's extramarital affairs?

443
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:07,320
<33-4,ROGER>她很擅长保密
<33-4,ROGER>She was good at keeping secrets.

444
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,930
<33-5,CASTLE>那么为什么雇佣妮娜供职的酒席承包公司
<33-5,CASTLE>Then why hire the catering company that Nina worked for?

445
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:11,190
<33-6,ROGER>是桑迪推荐的
<33-6,ROGER>Sadie's recommendation.

446
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,810
<33-6,ROGER>她去过一场他们承办的活动
<33-6,ROGER>She went to an event that they catered,

447
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:13,980
<33-6,ROGER>说食物很棒
<33-6,ROGER>said the food was amazing.

448
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:17,780
<33-7,JOANNA>我敢说桑迪和妮娜就那么认识的
<33-7,JOANNA>I bet that's how Sadie and Nina met.

449
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,050
<33-7,JOANNA>你说呢  理查德
<33-7,JOANNA>What do you think, Richard?

450
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,280
<33-8,CASTLE>很有可能
<33-8,CASTLE>Entirely possible.

451
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,410
<33-9,JOANNA>瞧  我就说过我是妮基·希特的大粉丝
<33-9,JOANNA>See! I told you I was a Nikki Heat fan.

452
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:23,750
<33-9,JOANNA>我连思路都想她
<33-9,JOANNA>I even think like her, too.

453
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,490
<33-11,JOANNA>-简直不可思议  -是啊
<33-11,JOANNA>- It's uncanny. - I know.

454
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:26,770
<33-12,CASTLE>幸好你把
<33-12,CASTLE>It's good that you moved

455
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:28,390
<33-12,CASTLE>篮球板移到了离别墅远点的地方
<33-12,CASTLE>the basketball hoop away from the townhouse.

456
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:29,430
<33-13,RYAN>是啊  那东西
<33-13,RYAN>Oh, yeah, those things,

457
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:31,330
<33-13,RYAN>就是对盗贼的邀请函
<33-13,RYAN>they're just an invitation for burglars to break in.

458
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:33,280
<33-14,CASTLE>或是帮助妮娜这样的杀人犯逃跑
<33-14,CASTLE>Or murderers like Nina to break out.

459
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:36,220
<33-15,JOANNA>我们一直把篮球板放在那里  妮娜给搬动了
<33-15,JOANNA>Well, we always keep the hoop there. Nina moved it.

460
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,270
<33-16,ROGER>是啊  我们直到
<33-16,ROGER>Yeah, we didn't even realize

461
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:39,270
<33-16,ROGER>凶案发生后第二天才意识到她搬过
<33-16,ROGER>that she had until the day after the murder.

462
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:41,590
<33-17,CASTLE>你们怎么确定是妮娜搬的
<33-17,CASTLE>How are you sure it was Nina that moved it?

463
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:43,840
<33-18,JOANNA>如果不是她
<33-18,JOANNA>Well, if it wasn't her,

464
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:46,120
<33-18,JOANNA>还能是谁啊
<33-18,JOANNA>who else could it have been?

465
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,680
<33-19,CASTLE>莱恩  说句话
<33-19,CASTLE>Ryan, a moment?

466
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:49,680
<33-19,CASTLE>失陪一下
<33-19,CASTLE>Excuse us.

467
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,300
<33-19,CASTLE>篮球板被移动
<33-19,CASTLE>The basketball hoop being moved

468
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,730
<33-19,CASTLE>说明是事先有预谋
<33-19,CASTLE>speaks to a premeditative act.

469
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:56,880
<33-20,RYAN>是啊  但我们的理论是
<33-20,RYAN>Yeah, but our theory of this whole thing

470
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,740
<33-20,RYAN>这是一起激情犯罪  你觉得呢
<33-20,RYAN>is a crime of passion. What are you thinking?

471
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,620
<33-21,CASTLE>我们并不了解全部内情
<33-21,CASTLE>That we don't know the whole story.

472
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:03,800
<33-21,CASTLE>我看到妮娜骑在桑迪身上前这楼上还有别人
<33-21,CASTLE>Someone else was up here before I caught Nina over Sadie.

473
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,020
<34-1,WELLER>告诉我你在开玩笑吧
<34-1,WELLER>Please tell me you're joking.

474
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:08,420
<34-2,CASTLE>篮球板被移动过这一点很重要
<34-2,CASTLE>The fact the basketball hoop was moved is significant

475
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:10,960
<34-2,CASTLE>因为妮娜是没理由动它的
<34-2,CASTLE>because Nina didn't have any reason to do it.

476
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,040
<34-3,WELLER>凯特  为什么叫我来
<34-3,WELLER>Kate... why am I back here?

477
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,610
<34-4,BECKETT>马库斯  这一点很有道理
<34-4,BECKETT>Marcus, this is a legitimate concern.

478
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:18,290
<34-4,BECKETT>如果不是妮娜动了篮球板  那么是谁  为什么
<34-4,BECKETT>If Nina didn't move the hoop, then who did and why?

479
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:21,780
<34-5,WELLER>我们别忘了我们所知的  卡塞尔看见了妮娜杀桑迪
<34-5,WELLER>Let's stick with what we know. Castle saw Nina kill Sadie.

480
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:22,700
<34-5,WELLER>就是这样
<34-5,WELLER>End of story.

481
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,570
<34-6,CASTLE>我现在已经不百分百确定了
<34-6,CASTLE>I'm not actually 100% sure about that anymore.

482
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:26,480
<34-6,CASTLE>等等  别告诉我
<34-6,CASTLE>Wait. Don't tell me you're

483
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,990
<34-7,WELLER>你信了卡莱布那套荒谬的抗辩
<34-7,WELLER>buying into Caleb's ridiculous defense.

484
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:32,070
<34-7,WELLER>里克  你今天在庭上被整懵了  这时有发生
<34-7,WELLER>Rick, you got your bell rung in court today. It happens.

485
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,820
<34-7,WELLER>卡莱布·布朗是个好律师
<34-7,WELLER>Caleb Brown is a hell of an attorney.

486
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:35,070
<34-7,WELLER>你现在得放手了
<34-7,WELLER>Now you got to let it go.

487
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:36,910
<34-8,CASTLE>你不打算调查吗
<34-8,CASTLE>So you're not going to investigate?

488
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,110
<34-9,WELLER>你看到录像了  她们有私情
<34-9,WELLER>You saw the tape. They were having an affair.

489
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:43,330
<34-9,WELLER>这是激情犯罪  妮娜有罪  就这么简单
<34-9,WELLER>It's a crime of passion. Nina is guilty, plain and simple.

490
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:44,880
<34-10,CASTLE>我们不是得完全确定吗
<34-10,CASTLE>Don't we have to be sure?

491
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,230
<34-11,WELLER>里克  看着我  我确定
<34-11,WELLER>Rick, look at me. I'm sure.

492
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:49,440
<34-12,CASTLE>-马库斯  或许我们...  -够了
<34-12,CASTLE>- Marcus, if we could just... - Stop.

493
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:50,870
<34-13,WELLER>这案子容不得
<34-13,WELLER>This case cannot afford

494
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:53,980
<34-13,WELLER>你再往别人耳朵里灌输怀疑了
<34-13,WELLER>to have you pour any more doubt into people's ears.

495
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:00,450
<34-14,WELLER>听我说  我知道你俩分居了
<34-14,WELLER>Listen, I know you two are separated and all,

496
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:02,420
<34-14,WELLER>但你能不能劝劝他
<34-14,WELLER>but could you please talk to him?

497
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,890
<34-16,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你真认为妮娜是清白的吗
<34-16,BECKETT>Castle, are you sure that Nina's innocent?

498
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:15,320
<34-16,BECKETT>我不知道
<34-16,BECKETT>I don't know.

499
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,890
<34-17,CASTLE>但比让有罪者获得自由更糟的是什么
<34-17,CASTLE>But what's worse than letting a guilty person go free?

500
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,580
<34-18,BECKETT>把无辜之人送进监狱
<34-18,BECKETT>Sending an innocent one to jail.

501
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,070
<34-18,BECKETT>好吧
<34-18,BECKETT>All right.

502
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:25,770
<34-18,BECKETT>回家吧  我一会儿再过去
<34-18,BECKETT>Go home. I'll swing by later.

503
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,900
<35-1,MARTHA RODGERS>你不相信你亲眼所见
<35-1,MARTHA RODGERS>So you don't trust what you saw?

504
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,960
<35-2,CASTLE>我现在不确定了
<35-2,CASTLE>I don't know that I can anymore.

505
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:36,680
<35-2,CASTLE>我只是不停在脑海中回放那些画面
<35-2,CASTLE>I just...keep running it in my head over and over again.

506
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:39,890
<35-3,MARTHA>你觉得妮娜只是在帮助那个可怜女人
<35-3,MARTHA>And you think Nina was just trying to help this poor woman?

507
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,230
<35-4,CASTLE>妮娜当时背对着我
<35-4,CASTLE>Nina's back was to me.

508
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:44,240
<35-4,CASTLE>我确实没看见致命一击  我
<35-4,CASTLE>I didn't actually see the death blow. I...

509
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:46,200
<35-4,CASTLE>你们得相信我
<35-4,CASTLE>You got to believe me, you guys.

510
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,220
<35-4,CASTLE>看起来真的像是她杀的人
<35-4,CASTLE>I-it really looked like she did it.

511
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,670
<35-5,MARTHA>我相信你
<35-5,MARTHA>Mm-hmm. Well, I believe you.

512
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:53,050
<35-5,MARTHA>说实话听起来也像妮娜是杀人凶手
<35-5,MARTHA>It's just honestly it sounds to me like nina killed her.

513
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,680
<35-7,CASTLE>-我也觉得  -我必须查出真相
<35-7,CASTLE>- Me too. - I have to find out for sure.

514
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,530
<35-8,ALEXIS>爸爸  那是不可能的
<35-8,ALEXIS>Dad, there's no way to do that.

515
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:58,500
<35-8,ALEXIS>我明白
<35-8,ALEXIS>I know.

516
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:01,810
<35-9,CASTLE>或许有可能呢
<35-9,CASTLE>Or is there?

517
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:04,090
<35-9,CASTLE>我有办法了
<35-9,CASTLE>I've got it.

518
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:05,230
<35-9,CASTLE>我只要做到两点
<35-9,CASTLE>And I'd only have to do two things.

519
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:07,870
<35-9,CASTLE>第一  把庭审延期  我就有机会调查
<35-9,CASTLE>One, delay the trial so I have a chance to investigate,

520
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:11,230
<35-9,CASTLE>第二  我要和妮娜面谈
<35-9,CASTLE>And two, have a one-on-one conversation with Nina.

521
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:13,760
<35-10,ALEXIS>妮娜的律师不会同意的
<35-10,ALEXIS>Uh, Nina's lawyer will never allow it.

522
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,370
<35-11,CASTLE>所以我必须非常聪明
<35-11,CASTLE>Which is why I'm going to have to be very clever

523
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:16,860
<35-11,CASTLE>变通处理
<35-11,CASTLE>with how I go about this.

524
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,360
<35-12,MARTHA>我猜你有计划了吧
<35-12,MARTHA>I take it you have a plan.

525
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,970
<35-13,CASTLE>你知道我有的  妈妈
<35-13,CASTLE>You know I do, mother.

526
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:22,010
<35-14,MARTHA>我能问是什么计划吗
<35-14,MARTHA>Might I ask you what it?

527
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:23,670
<35-15,CASTLE>我要把自己弄进监狱
<35-15,CASTLE>I'm gonna get thrown in jail.

529
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:31,220
<36-1,JUDGE WOLLCOTT>什么事
<36-1,JUDGE WOLLCOTT>Yes?

530
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,250
<36-2,CASTLE>早上好  法官大人
<36-2,CASTLE>Good morning, your honor.

531
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,140
<36-3,JUDGE WOLLCOTT>卡塞尔先生  你不能进来
<36-3,JUDGE WOLLCOTT>Mr. Castle, you can't be in here.

532
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,400
<36-4,CASTLE>可是我已经进来了
<36-4,CASTLE>And yet here I am.

533
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,660
<36-4,CASTLE>法官大人  昨天我在庭上出糗
<36-4,CASTLE>Your honor, I was made a fool of yesterday on the stand.

534
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:44,270
<36-4,CASTLE>我要维护名声的  所以我想再来一次
<36-4,CASTLE>I have a reputation to protect, so I would like...A do-over.

535
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:45,590
<36-5,JUDGE WOLLCOTT>再来一次
<36-5,JUDGE WOLLCOTT>A do-over?

536
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:46,390
<36-5,JUDGE WOLLCOTT>再来一次
<36-5,JUDGE WOLLCOTT>A do-over.

537
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:48,930
<36-7,JUDGE WOLLCOTT>好吧  我说两点  第一  那太蠢了
<36-7,JUDGE WOLLCOTT>Okay, two things. One -- that's stupid.

538
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:51,670
<36-7,JUDGE WOLLCOTT>第二  你跑到我的办公室就很不道德
<36-7,JUDGE WOLLCOTT>And two -- your presence in my chambers is highly unethical.

539
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,620
<36-7,JUDGE WOLLCOTT>我可以以蔑视法庭为由收押你
<36-7,JUDGE WOLLCOTT>I could hold you in contempt of court for this.

540
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:57,230
<36-8,CASTLE>我倒想让你试试
<36-8,CASTLE>Well, I would like to... see you try.

541
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:03,040
<36-9,JUDGE WOLLCOTT>雷吉  请你进来
<36-9,JUDGE WOLLCOTT>Reggie, come in here, please.

542
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:07,090
<36-9,JUDGE WOLLCOTT>卡塞尔先生  我知道你和市长的交情
<36-9,JUDGE WOLLCOTT>Mr. Castle, I'm aware of your friendship with the mayor,

543
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:10,410
<36-9,JUDGE WOLLCOTT>所以虽然你不配  我还是放你一马
<36-9,JUDGE WOLLCOTT>So even though you don't deserve it, I'm gonna let you go.

544
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:13,970
<36-9,JUDGE WOLLCOTT>雷吉  请把他送出大楼
<36-9,JUDGE WOLLCOTT>Reggie, escort him out of the building, please.

545
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:19,880
<36-10,CASTLE>法官大人  我看你是在哈德逊大学
<36-10,CASTLE>Oh. Your honor, I see you attended law school

546
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,740
<36-10,CASTLE>读的法学院
<36-10,CASTLE>at Hudson University. Mm.

547
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,790
<36-10,CASTLE>怪不得你的工作做得那么烂
<36-10,CASTLE>That explains why you're so bad at your job.

548
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:24,980
<36-11,JUDGE WOLLCOTT>你说什么
<36-11,JUDGE WOLLCOTT>Excuse me?

00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,240
<36-21,JUDGE WOLLCOTT>蔑视法庭  把他扔到牢里去
<36-21,JUDGE WOLLCOTT>Contempt. Have him thrown into a holding cell.

569
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:24,960
<37-1,NINA>我的审讯五分钟前就该开始了
<37-1,NINA>Hey, my trial was supposed to begin like five minutes ago.

570
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,520
<37-2,OFFICER>-发生什么了  -法官推迟到了明天
<37-2,OFFICER>- What's going on? - Judge postponed your trial until tomorrow.

571
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,820
<37-2,OFFICER>你今天晚上会被送回里克尔斯岛监狱
<37-2,OFFICER>You'll be transported back to Rikers at the end of the day.

572
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,610
<37-3,CASTLE>你是怎么进来的
<37-3,CASTLE>So, what are you in for?

573
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,010
<37-3,CASTLE>对不起  这不好笑
<37-3,CASTLE>Sorry, bad joke.

574
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,180
<37-4,NINA>别跟我说话
<37-4,NINA>Don't talk to me.

575
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:42,230
<37-5,CASTLE>妮娜  我知道你和桑迪的地下情了
<37-5,CASTLE>Nina, look, I know about the affair with Sadie.

576
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:43,950
<37-5,CASTLE>助理检察官也知道了
<37-5,CASTLE>The A.D.A. knows it, too.

577
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:45,840
<37-5,CASTLE>他会利用这点置你于死地
<37-5,CASTLE>He is gonna use it to bury you.

578
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,210
<37-6,NINA>你为什么说这些
<37-6,NINA>Why are you telling me this?

579
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:50,860
<37-7,CASTLE>我在现场  妮娜  我亲眼看见你了
<37-7,CASTLE>I was there, Nina. I saw you. I saw you with my own eyes.

580
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:53,400
<37-8,NINA>我没杀害桑迪  我爱过她
<37-8,NINA>I didn't kill Sadie! I loved her.

581
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:55,690
<37-8,NINA>你是在现场  但是你看错了
<37-8,NINA>So, yeah, you were there, but you saw it wrong.

582
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:57,310
<37-9,CASTLE>那就告诉我  我没看见什么
<37-9,CASTLE>So tell me what I missed.

583
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:00,800
<37-10,NINA>我发现桑迪躺在地上  有人已经捅伤了她
<37-10,NINA>I found Sadie on the ground. Someone had already stabbed her.

584
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:04,410
<37-10,NINA>她呼吸困难  所以我把棍子拔了出来
<37-10,NINA>She was struggling to breathe, so I pulled the poker out.

585
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:06,740
<37-10,NINA>我是想帮她
<37-10,NINA>I was trying to help her.

586
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:08,620
<37-11,CASTLE>那你为什么要跑
<37-11,CASTLE>So then why did you run?

587
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:11,130
<37-12,NINA>我知道看起来是什么样  我慌神了
<37-12,NINA>I knew how it looked. I panicked.

588
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:13,180
<37-13,CASTLE>那你被警察逮捕的时候为什么不告诉他们
<37-13,CASTLE>Why didn't you tell that to the police when they caught you?

589
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:17,630
<37-14,NINA>别闹了  我以前也被抓过  被害惨了
<37-14,NINA>Please. I've been arrested before, and I got screwed over.

590
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:20,570
<37-14,NINA>知道为什么吗  因为那些警察没人相信我
<37-14,NINA>You know why? Because none of the cops believed me.

591
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:22,580
<37-14,NINA>我不会再犯同一个错误
<37-14,NINA>I wasn't gonna make the same mistake twice.

592
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:24,910
<37-15,CASTLE>-至少告诉你的律师了吧  -当然
<37-15,CASTLE>- Did you at least tell your lawyer? - Of course.

593
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:28,550
<37-16,NINA>我把那事全告诉原来的公辩律师了
<37-16,NINA>I told my original public defender all about the affair,

594
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:30,710
<37-16,NINA>他说这只能给人杀人动机的感觉
<37-16,NINA>But he said it'd just come across as motive.

595
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:33,270
<37-16,NINA>太"出人意料"了  果然如此
<37-16,NINA>Surprise, surprise. It did.

596
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:35,070
<37-17,CASTLE>那场争斗是怎么回事
<37-17,CASTLE>What about the fight?

597
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,950
<37-17,CASTLE>你和桑迪在酒吧门口的争斗
<37-17,CASTLE>The fight you had with Sadie outside the bar

598
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:38,210
<37-17,CASTLE>谋杀案发生的前一晚
<37-17,CASTLE>The night before the murder?

599
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,580
<37-18,NINA>不是什么重要的事
<37-18,NINA>It was nothing.

600
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,060
<37-18,NINA>妮娜
<37-18,NINA>Nina...

601
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,680
<37-19,CASTLE>妮娜
<37-19,CASTLE>Nina.

602
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:44,920
<37-19,CASTLE>我觉得你说的是实话
<37-19,CASTLE>I think you're telling the truth,

603
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:48,780
<37-19,CASTLE>但是你不告诉我事情的全部我也帮不了你
<37-19,CASTLE>but I can't help you unless you tell me the whole story.

604
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,670
<37-20,NINA>是因为好几件事情争执起来的
<37-20,NINA>The fight was about a couple things.

605
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:58,190
<37-20,NINA>我受够了偷偷摸摸
<37-20,NINA>I was sick of sneaking around,

606
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,200
<37-20,NINA>但是桑迪太偏执了  因为她过去
<37-20,NINA>But Sadie was all paranoid because she had been caught

607
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,320
<37-20,NINA>和别的男人偷情被抓到过
<37-20,NINA>cheating with other guys in the past.

608
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,430
<37-21,CASTLE>别的男人
<37-21,CASTLE>Other guys?

609
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,930
<37-21,CASTLE>所以你是她的第一个
<37-21,CASTLE>So, you were her first...

610
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,030
<37-22,NINA>同性恋人
<37-22,NINA>Lesbian?

611
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,760
<37-22,NINA>是的  有问题吗
<37-22,NINA>Yes. Is that a problem?

612
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:11,820
<37-23,CASTLE>我不介意  查查我的搜索历史你就明白了
<37-23,CASTLE>No, not with me. You should check my search history.

613
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:14,330
<37-23,CASTLE>但你说你们是因为好几件事情吵起来的
<37-23,CASTLE>But you said you were arguing about a couple of things.

614
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:16,600
<37-24,NINA>真正惹怒我的是桑迪让我
<37-24,NINA>What really pissed me off was that Sadie asked me

615
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,030
<37-24,NINA>在鸡尾酒宴会上做些事情
<37-24,NINA>to do something at that cocktail party.

616
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,210
<37-25,CASTLE>她让你做什么
<37-25,CASTLE>What did she ask you to do?

617
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:22,830
<37-26,NINA>把罗杰·马特斯的空酒杯拿给她
<37-26,NINA>Bring her Roger Masters' empty champagne glass.

618
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,140
<37-27,CASTLE>宴会的主人罗杰·马特斯吗
<37-27,CASTLE>Roger Masters the host?

619
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,940
<37-27,CASTLE>-她要他的空杯子干什么  -她没说
<37-27,CASTLE>- Why would she want his empty glass? - She wouldn't say.

620
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,520
<37-28,NINA>这真的让我火冒三丈
<37-28,NINA>And that really got me fired up

621
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,670
<37-28,NINA>如果我被抓到偷东西
<37-28,NINA>Because if I got caught stealing,

622
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:34,290
<37-28,NINA>即使是像香槟杯这样的小玩意
<37-28,NINA>even something as trivial as a champagne glass,

623
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,990
<37-28,NINA>也会让我丢掉工作
<37-28,NINA>I would've lost my job.

624
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:38,350
<37-29,CASTLE>但你最后还是为她偷来了  不是吗
<37-29,CASTLE>But you stole it for her anyway, didn't you?

625
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,110
<37-30,NINA>到头来  我愿意为桑迪做任何事情
<37-30,NINA>At the end of the day, I'd do anything for Sadie,

626
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:42,320
<37-30,NINA>她也清楚
<37-30,NINA>and she knew it.

627
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:44,680
<37-30,NINA>遇见她的那一刻  她就已经抓住了我的心
<37-30,NINA>She had me wrapped around her finger the moment I met her.

628
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,600
<37-31,CASTLE>说清楚点  发生了什么
<37-31,CASTLE>Walk me through it. Tell me what happened.

629
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,580
<37-32,NINA>罗杰喝完了他的香槟后
<37-32,NINA>When Roger was done with his champagne,

630
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,250
<37-32,NINA>我回收了空杯子悄悄递给了桑迪
<37-32,NINA>I retrieved the empty glass and quietly handed it off to Sadie.

631
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:55,440
<37-33,CASTLE>-她用那个做什么  -上楼了
<37-33,CASTLE>- What did she do with it? - Went upstairs.

632
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,800
<37-34,NINA>大概20分钟后我上去
<37-34,NINA>I followed her up like 20 minutes later

633
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:58,260
<37-34,NINA>想看看她到底要干嘛
<37-34,NINA>to see what was going on.

634
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:00,250
<37-34,NINA>那时我发现她倒在地上
<37-34,NINA>That's when I found her.

635
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,390
<37-35,CASTLE>-你把这些都告诉了你的律师吗  - 没错
<37-35,CASTLE>- And you told all this to your lawyer? - Yes.

636
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:03,680
<37-35,CASTLE>但是我原来的公诉人
<37-35,CASTLE>But my original public defender

637
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,200
<37-36,NINA>手头案子太多
<37-36,NINA>was too overloaded with other cases.

638
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:09,390
<37-36,NINA>实话说吧  他认为我有罪
<37-36,NINA>And, truth be told, he thought I was guilty.

639
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:12,060
<37-36,NINA>他还想让我接受检察官的认罪协议
<37-36,NINA>He wanted me to take the A.D.A.'s plea deal.

640
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:14,510
<37-36,NINA>辛亏卡莱布·布朗接手了
<37-36,NINA>Thank god Caleb Brown took over.

641
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:16,260
<37-36,NINA>至少他是在为我拼命辩护
<37-36,NINA>At least he's fighting for me.

642
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,960
<37-37,ESPOSITO>关着的感觉怎样  囚犯
<37-37,ESPOSITO>Yo. How's it hanging, jailbird?

643
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:23,420
<37-38,RYAN>你已经惹恼了助理地检官
<37-38,RYAN>You already pissed off the A.D.A.

644
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,490
<37-38,RYAN>于是你就想
<37-38,RYAN>So, what, you figured,

645
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,050
<37-38,RYAN>何不把法官也给惹毛了呢
<37-38,RYAN>why the hell not piss off the judge, as well?

646
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:28,100
<37-39,CASTLE>没错  你们可以把我弄出去吗
<37-39,CASTLE>Yeah. Can you guys get me out of here?

647
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,310
<37-40,ESPOSITO>早就办好了  法警叫我们接你出来
<37-40,ESPOSITO>Already done. Bailiff called us to come get you.

648
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,430
<37-41,CASTLE>我会查出事情的真相的
<37-41,CASTLE>I'm gonna figure out what happened.

649
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:39,330
<37-41,CASTLE>我保证
<37-41,CASTLE>I promise.

650
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,300
<38-1,BECKETT>你是疯了吗
<38-1,BECKETT>Are you out of your mind?

651
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,710
<38-2,CASTLE>我又没做错什么
<38-2,CASTLE>I didn't do anything wrong.

652
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:46,650
<38-3,BECKETT>你忽悠法官推迟庭审
<38-3,BECKETT>You tricked a judge to postpone a trial,

653
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:49,060
<38-3,BECKETT>然后你还非法审问了被告人
<38-3,BECKETT>and then you illegally questioned the defendant.

654
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,550
<38-4,CASTLE>对  但除此之外我没做错什么啊
<38-4,CASTLE>Yeah, but other than that, I didn't do anything wrong.

655
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:54,580
<38-5,ESPOSITO>贝克特  卡塞尔相信妮娜是无辜的了
<38-5,ESPOSITO>Yo, Beckett, Castle's convinced that Nina's innocent now.

656
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,540
<38-6,BECKETT>因为什么
<38-6,BECKETT>Because why?

657
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:57,770
<38-6,BECKETT>就因为桑迪想要罗杰的杯子吗
<38-6,BECKETT>Because Sadie wanted Roger's glass?

658
00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:00,590
<38-7,CASTLE>我认为她是想收集他的DNA
<38-7,CASTLE>I think she was after his DNA.

659
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:02,150
<38-8,BECKETT>为什么
<38-8,BECKETT>Why?

660
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:05,710
<38-9,CASTLE>罗杰当她的摄影师20年了
<38-9,CASTLE>Roger was her cameraman for 20 years.

661
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:09,030
<38-9,CASTLE>妮娜说桑迪和男人有过外遇
<38-9,CASTLE>Nina said that Sadie had had affairs with men in the past.

662
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:10,530
<38-9,CASTLE>或许他们确实存在这种关系
<38-9,CASTLE>Maybe they had had one,

663
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:13,000
<38-9,CASTLE>那么桑迪的女儿实际是罗杰的
<38-9,CASTLE>and Sadie's daughter was actually Roger's.

664
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:16,000
<38-10,BECKETT>所以你认为桑迪搞出了整件事情
<38-10,BECKETT>So, uh, what, you think that Sadie cooked this whole thing up

665
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,780
<38-10,BECKETT>这样她能得到样本去做亲子鉴定吗
<38-10,BECKETT>So she could get a DNA sample for a paternity test?

666
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:20,660
<38-11,CASTLE>只有一个法子知道真相了
<38-11,CASTLE>Only one way to find out.

667
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:21,830
<38-12,RYAN>你想让我们去吗  警监
<38-12,RYAN>What do you want us to do, Captain?

668
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:23,970
<38-14,VIKRAM>-我  -贝克特  快看
<38-14,VIKRAM>- I -- - Beckett. Look.

669
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:29,670
<38-15,BECKETT>去和罗杰谈吧  看他知道些什么
<38-15,BECKETT>Uh, go talk to Roger, see what he knows.

670
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:32,030
<39-1,VIKRAM>他来这儿干嘛
<39-1,VIKRAM>What is he doing here?

671
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:34,300
<39-2,BECKETT>我来处理  你自然点
<39-2,BECKETT>I'll handle this. You just be normal.

672
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:37,890
<39-2,BECKETT>警监  你越线了
<39-2,BECKETT>Captain, you crossed the line.

673
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,880
<40-1,BROWN>我知道你让卡塞尔偷偷去问讯了我的客户
<40-1,BROWN>I know that you had Castle go in and interview my client --

674
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,840
<40-2,BECKETT>听着  律师  卡塞尔和我已经分居了
<40-2,BECKETT>Look, Counselor, Castle and I are separated.

675
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,480
<40-2,BECKETT>他已不隶属于12分局
<40-2,BECKETT>He is no longer associated with the 12th precinct.

676
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,260
<40-2,BECKETT>所以不管是我还是纽约警局
<40-2,BECKETT>So neither I nor the NYPD

677
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,940
<40-2,BECKETT>都无需对他的行为负责
<40-2,BECKETT>can be held accountable for his actions.

678
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,380
<40-3,BROWN>所以你根本就不知道吗
<40-3,BROWN>So you knew nothing about it?

679
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:52,200
<40-4,BECKETT>这就是我说的意思  不是吗
<40-4,BECKETT>That's what I said, isn't it?

680
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,150
<40-5,BROWN>我不相信你
<40-5,BROWN>I don't believe you.

681
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:54,450
<40-6,BECKETT>我不在乎
<40-6,BECKETT>And I don't care.

682
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,870
<40-7,BROWN>典型的警察风格
<40-7,BROWN>Typical cop.

683
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:57,640
<40-8,BECKETT>等等
<40-8,BECKETT>Wait.

684
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,160
<40-9,BROWN>干嘛
<40-9,BROWN>What?

685
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:02,110
<40-10,BECKETT>听着  如果你重申我接下来说的话
<40-10,BECKETT>Look, if you repeat what I'm about to tell you,

686
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:03,500
<40-10,BECKETT>我会否认的
<40-10,BECKETT>I will deny it.

687
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,760
<40-10,BECKETT>我让人去调查妮娜的案子了
<40-10,BECKETT>I have people looking into Nina's case.

688
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:10,390
<40-11,BROWN>你相信她是无辜的吗
<40-11,BROWN>Do you believe that she's innocent?

689
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:13,300
<40-12,BECKETT>我可没说  但我认为我们必须要弄清楚
<40-12,BECKETT>I didn't say that, but I think we have to be thorough.

690
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,070
<40-12,BECKETT>既然庭审被推迟了
<40-12,BECKETT>And now that the trial has been postponed,

691
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:17,000
<40-12,BECKETT>我们有时间进行下一步调查
<40-12,BECKETT>We have time to investigate further.

692
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,590
<40-13,BROWN>我很感谢  警监
<40-13,BROWN>I appreciate that, Captain.

693
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:23,180
<40-14,BECKETT>律师  妮娜直到昨晨都还不是你的客户
<40-14,BECKETT>Counselor, Nina wasn't your client until yesterday morning.

694
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:25,470
<40-14,BECKETT>为什么你对这个案子这么上心
<40-14,BECKETT>Why are you so passionate about this case?

695
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:28,050
<40-15,BROWN>我猜是和你一样原因
<40-15,BROWN>For the same reason that I assume you are.

696
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:29,780
<40-15,BROWN>公正
<40-15,BROWN>Justice.

697
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:31,580
<40-15,BROWN>我是卡莱布·布朗
<40-15,BROWN>This is Caleb Brown.

698
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,150
<40-15,BROWN>好的
<40-15,BROWN>Yes.

699
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:37,090
<40-15,BROWN>怎么
<40-15,BROWN>Yeah?

700
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,980
<40-15,BROWN>好的  我马上过去
<40-15,BROWN>Yeah. Yeah, I'm on my way.

701
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,120
<40-15,BROWN>在法官赶回自己家的时候
<40-15,BROWN>So, while the judge was heading home,

702
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,460
<40-15,BROWN>打电话给邻居  让其帮忙查看自己的房子
<40-15,BROWN>She called a neighbor, who checked on her house.

703
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:45,670
<40-15,BROWN>结果房子根本没被盗窃
<40-15,BROWN>Turns out, the house was not burglarized.

704
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,810
<40-15,BROWN>总之  法官准备一个半小时之后开庭
<40-15,BROWN>Anyway, she's ordered that the trial resume in a half an hour.

705
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:51,040
<40-15,BROWN>如果你的人想帮忙证明妮娜的清白
<40-15,BROWN>So if your people are going to help prove nina's innocence,

706
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,100
<40-15,BROWN>他们最好快点
<40-15,BROWN>they'd better hurry.

707
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:01,170
<41-1,ROGER>又是你
<41-1,ROGER>You again.

708
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:03,260
<41-2,CASTLE>你好  罗杰  我们得谈谈
<41-2,CASTLE>Hello, Roger. We need to talk.

709
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:04,350
<41-3,ROGER>又怎么了
<41-3,ROGER>Now what?

710
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:05,610
<41-4,CASTLE>乔安娜
<41-4,CASTLE>Joanna.

711
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,410
<41-5,JOANNA>你好
<41-5,JOANNA>Well, hello!

712
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:10,460
<41-6,CASTLE>抱歉突然来访  我们不会打扰太久的
<41-6,CASTLE>Sorry for the interruption. This won't take long.

713
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,200
<41-6,CASTLE>确实耽搁不了  庭审马上就要开始了
<41-6,CASTLE>It actually can't. Trial's gonna start again in a few minutes.

714
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,110
<41-6,CASTLE>我们必须确认真正的凶手是谁
<41-6,CASTLE>And we need to nail down who the real killer is

715
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:16,980
<41-6,CASTLE>在无辜者被定罪之前
<41-6,CASTLE>before an innocent woman gets convicted.

716
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:19,020
<41-7,ROGER>你说谁是无辜的  你看到她杀了桑迪
<41-7,ROGER>What do you mean innocent? You saw that woman kill Sadie.

717
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:21,100
<41-8,CASTLE>不  罗杰  我只是以为我看到了
<41-8,CASTLE>No, Roger, I only thought I did.

718
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,860
<41-8,CASTLE>你看  头脑是个有趣的东西
<41-8,CASTLE>You see, the mind is a funny thing.

719
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:25,350
<41-8,CASTLE>不像一个空的容器  它填补空白
<41-8,CASTLE>Doesn't like a vacuum. So it fills in the blanks.

720
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:27,940
<41-8,CASTLE>就像当我发现桑迪和妮娜的恋爱关系时
<41-8,CASTLE>Much like when I discovered Sadie and Nina were having an affair,

721
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:30,780
<41-8,CASTLE>我自然地以为妮娜和恋人吵架后杀了她
<41-8,CASTLE>I automatically assumed Nina killed her in a lover's quarrel

722
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,190
<41-8,CASTLE>而实际上她们两个人一起
<41-8,CASTLE>When really the two of them were working together

723
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:34,530
<41-8,CASTLE>想从你那里拿些什么  罗杰
<41-8,CASTLE>to get something from you, Roger.

724
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:37,300
<41-9,JOANNA>他在说些什么
<41-9,JOANNA>What is he talking about?

725
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,770
<41-10,ROGER>我也不知道
<41-10,ROGER>I'm sure I have no idea.

726
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:39,870
<41-11,ESPOSITO>-我能补充吗  -请吧
<41-11,ESPOSITO>- May I? - Please.

727
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:42,220
<41-12,CASTLE>桑迪要妮娜带一个玻璃杯给她
<41-12,CASTLE>Turns out that Sadie asked Nina to bring her a glass

728
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,810
<41-13,ESPOSITO>上面附着你的DNA
<41-13,ESPOSITO>with your DNA on it.

729
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:45,570
<41-13,ESPOSITO>问题就是为什么要这么做
<41-13,ESPOSITO>The question is why.

730
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,990
<41-15,ESPOSITO>-该我说了  -上吧
<41-15,ESPOSITO>- My turn? - Go for it.

731
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,760
<41-16,RYAN>我们认为你和桑迪有过外遇
<41-16,RYAN>We think that you were having an affair with Sadie.

732
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:52,200
<41-16,RYAN>我就知道
<41-16,RYAN>I knew it!

733
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:53,750
<41-17,JOANNA>这么多年你们俩在一起工作
<41-17,JOANNA>All those years you were working together,

734
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,910
<41-17,JOANNA>你们那些秘密的小情话
<41-17,JOANNA>Your little secret conversations.

735
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:57,820
<41-17,JOANNA>你一直都背着我在偷腥  是吧
<41-17,JOANNA>You were cheating on me this whole time, weren't you?

736
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,570
<41-18,ROGER>亲爱的这不是真的  我发誓
<41-18,ROGER>Honey, it's not true. I swear.

737
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:01,700
<41-19,CASTLE>桑迪想要你DNA的样本
<41-19,CASTLE>See, Sadie wanted a sample of your DNA

738
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:05,430
<41-19,CASTLE>好证明你就是桑迪女儿的父亲
<41-19,CASTLE>to prove that you are the father of Sadie's daughter.

739
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:08,750
<41-21,JOANNA>天呐  看在上帝的份上
<41-21,JOANNA>Oh, for the love of god.

740
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:11,750
<41-22,ROGER>-我早跟你说了  -我没有明白
<41-22,ROGER>- I told you. - I don't understand.

741
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:14,840
<41-24,JOANNA>罗杰他不能生育
<41-24,JOANNA>Roger is infertile...

742
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:18,350
<41-24,JOANNA>因为小时候的一次疾病  桑迪也知道
<41-24,JOANNA>Due to a childhood illness, and Sadie knew that.

743
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,620
<41-24,JOANNA>说不定连邮差也知道这件事
<41-24,JOANNA>Hell, the mailman probably knows it,

744
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,810
<41-24,JOANNA>鉴于罗杰对此事不停嘴
<41-24,JOANNA>given how much Roger talks about it.

745
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,620
<41-25,ROGER>那次经历非常痛苦
<41-25,ROGER>It was a very traumatic experience.

746
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:26,440
<41-25,ROGER>事已至此  我想请你们离开
<41-25,ROGER>As is this. I'd like you to leave.

747
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,100
<41-26,CASTLE>抱歉  罗杰  不行
<41-26,CASTLE>Sorry, Roger. No can do.

748
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,960
<41-26,CASTLE>桑迪想要你的杯子
<41-26,CASTLE>Sadie wanted your glass.

749
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,720
<41-26,CASTLE>如果不为DNA  那她想要什么
<41-26,CASTLE>If not for DNA, then why?

750
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,100
<41-27,RYAN>可能是指纹
<41-27,RYAN>Perhaps a fingerprint.

751
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,350
<41-28,ESPOSITO>桑迪为什么需要他的指纹
<41-28,ESPOSITO>Why would Sadie need his fingerprint?

752
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,020
<41-29,ROGER>我不知道
<41-29,ROGER>I have no idea.

753
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,350
<41-30,CASTLE>你妻子知道
<41-30,CASTLE>Your wife does.

754
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:45,600
<42-1,JOANNA>就在那儿  那幅画后面
<42-1,JOANNA>Right over there. Behind the picture.

755
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,050
<42-2,ROGER>乔安娜  你怎么能这样
<42-2,ROGER>Joanna, how could you?

756
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:49,520
<42-3,JOANNA>拜托  我多年来都一直想知道
<42-3,JOANNA>Oh, please, I've been dying to know what you've been hiding

757
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,480
<42-3,JOANNA>你的保险箱里藏着什么  罗杰
<42-3,JOANNA>in your safe for years now, Roger.

758
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,060
<42-3,JOANNA>就算你没把桑迪搞怀孕
<42-3,JOANNA>And the fact that you didn't knock up Sadie

759
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:55,140
<42-3,JOANNA>也不代表你没和其他女人乱搞
<42-3,JOANNA>doesn't mean you weren't knocking boots.

760
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:57,790
<42-4,ROGER>没有搜查令我是绝对不会打开它的
<42-4,ROGER>If you think I'm opening that without a warrant, you're crazy.

761
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:59,050
<42-5,CASTLE>拿到搜查令需要多长时间
<42-5,CASTLE>How long would it take to get us a warrant?

762
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:00,370
<42-6,RYAN>一两个小时
<42-6,RYAN>An hour or two.

763
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:02,240
<42-7,CASTLE>我们没那个时间了
<42-7,CASTLE>We don't have that kind of time.

764
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,050
<42-7,CASTLE>乔安娜  你是"妮奇·希特"系列的粉丝吧
<42-7,CASTLE>Joanna, you're a fan of Nikki Heat.

765
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:05,610
<42-8,JOANNA>那又怎样
<42-8,JOANNA>Yeah, so?

766
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:06,380
<42-9,CASTLE>我下一本书的主角
<42-9,CASTLE>So, how would you like to have

767
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:08,660
<42-9,CASTLE>就叫你的名字  你觉得如何
<42-9,CASTLE>a main character named after you in my next book?

768
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:10,900
<42-10,ROGER>乔安娜  你敢
<42-10,ROGER>Joanna, don't you dare.

769
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,360
<42-11,JOANNA>写成大反派怎么样
<42-11,JOANNA>How about a villain?

770
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:16,230
<42-12,CASTLE>成交
<42-12,CASTLE>Deal.

771
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:24,380
<42-13,ROGER>你不会的
<42-13,ROGER>You wouldn't.

772
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:51,660
<42-14,ESPOSITO>这录像带上有什么  罗杰
<42-14,ESPOSITO>What are we gonna find on this tape, Roger?

773
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,060
<43-1,SADIE>他们说就是这儿  对吧
<43-1,SADIE>Said it's here, right?

774
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,630
<43-2,ROGER>对  但你知道他们会撒谎
<43-2,ROGER>Yeah, but you know how they lie.

775
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:13,010
<43-3,SADIE>我有所发现
<43-3,SADIE>Here. Found something.

776
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:15,160
<43-4,ROGER>可别告诉我是大规模杀伤性武器
<43-4,ROGER>Tell me that's not a WMD.

777
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:23,330
<43-5,ROGER>-你知道那是什么  -嗯
<43-5,ROGER>- You know what that is? - Yeah.

778
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:24,790
<43-6,SADIE>中情局在伊拉克分发的
<43-6,SADIE>One of the $5-million duffel bags

779
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:26,770
<43-6,SADIE>装着五百万美元的旅行袋之一
<43-6,SADIE>the CIA's handing out all over Iraq.

780
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:27,770
<43-7,ROGER>我们把它拿走吧
<43-7,ROGER>Let's take it.

781
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:29,140
<43-8,SADIE>什么  不
<43-8,SADIE>What? No.

782
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,030
<43-9,ROGER>桑迪  别这样
<43-9,ROGER>Sadie, come on.

783
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:32,930
<43-9,ROGER>这可是五百万  没人会注意到的
<43-9,ROGER>It's 5 million bucks, and no one's ever gonna miss it.

784
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:35,770
<43-10,SADIE>罗杰  别想了  我们是记者不是贼
<43-10,SADIE>Roger, forget about it. We're reporters, not thieves.

785
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:38,330
<43-10,SADIE>等回到基地我就通知联合特种作战司令部
<43-10,SADIE>I'll notify JSOC when we get back to base.

786
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,390
<43-11,SADIE>好了  我们出去吧
<43-11,SADIE>All right, let's get out of here.

787
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:46,870
<43-12,BECKETT>但你们没丢下它  是吧
<43-12,BECKETT>But you didn't leave it, did you?

788
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:48,600
<43-13,ROGER>看录像带就知道我们丢下它了
<43-13,ROGER>You can see on the tape that we did.

789
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,220
<43-14,BECKETT>对  你一停止录像
<43-14,BECKETT>Sure, and then once you stopped recording,

790
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,530
<43-14,BECKETT>就回去拿它
<43-14,BECKETT>you went back to get it.

791
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:53,520
<43-15,ESPOSITO>在伊拉克战争期间
<43-15,ESPOSITO>Over a billion dollars in cash went missing

792
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,020
<43-15,ESPOSITO>超过十亿现金不翼而飞
<43-15,ESPOSITO>during the Iraq invasion.

793
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,550
<43-15,ESPOSITO>区区五百万又算得上什么
<43-15,ESPOSITO>What's a lousy $5 mil?

794
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:58,100
<43-15,ESPOSITO>你放不下  是不是
<43-15,ESPOSITO>You couldn't just leave it, could you?

795
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,920
<43-16,ROGER>不  我确实把它丢在那儿了
<43-16,ROGER>Yeah, that's exactly what I did.

796
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:03,080
<43-17,BECKETT>只不过桑迪没有  是不是
<43-17,BECKETT>Except Sadie didn't, did she?

797
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,190
<43-17,BECKETT>对  她没有
<43-17,BECKETT>No. She didn't.

798
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:08,000
<43-18,ROGER>她溜回去  独自拿走了那些钱
<43-18,ROGER>She snuck back and took it for herself,

799
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,420
<43-18,ROGER>然后把钱偷运回美国  想把我排除在外
<43-18,ROGER>and then she smuggled it to the States, tried to cut me out.

800
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:11,940
<43-19,BECKETT>但你有录像带  你用它勒索她
<43-19,BECKETT>But you had the tape, and you used that

801
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:14,200
<43-19,BECKETT>这样你也能拿到你的那份
<43-19,BECKETT>to blackmail her so you could get your share.

802
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,480
<43-20,ESPOSITO>但桑迪不想让你攥住把柄
<43-20,ESPOSITO>But Sadie didn't like you having all that leverage.

803
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,180
<43-20,ESPOSITO>我想不通的是
<43-20,ESPOSITO>What I can't figure out is,

804
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:20,790
<43-20,ESPOSITO>桑迪夺回录像带  怎么花了这么久
<43-20,ESPOSITO>what took Sadie so long to try to get this tape back from you?

805
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:24,950
<43-21,BECKETT>我明白了  桑迪之前给过你一笔钱
<43-21,BECKETT>Oh, I get it. You burned through the money

806
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:26,960
<43-21,BECKETT>你挥霍光了  所以还想要更多
<43-21,BECKETT>that Sadie gave you originally, so you needed more.

807
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,140
<43-22,ROGER>我欠下的债都堆成山了
<43-22,ROGER>I am mortgaged to the hilt, okay?

808
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:32,550
<43-22,ROGER>所有信用卡都透支了  我妻子还不停地花
<43-22,ROGER>All my credit cards are maxed, and my wife won't stop spending.

809
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:35,680
<43-22,ROGER>她在慈善拍卖会上花掉了一万五千多
<43-22,ROGER>Hell, she forked over 15 g's to that stupid charity auction.

810
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,980
<43-22,ROGER>就为了听伟大的理查德·卡塞尔
<43-22,ROGER>To have the great Richard Castle

811
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,700
<43-22,ROGER>朗读他小说中的几章
<43-22,ROGER>read a couple of chapters out of his novel.

812
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:41,180
<43-23,BECKETT>所以你去找桑迪要更多钱
<43-23,BECKETT>Okay, so you went to Sadie demanding more money,

813
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:43,720
<43-23,BECKETT>她拒绝了  那天晚上你抓到她
<43-23,BECKETT>she refused, and then when you caught her in your office

814
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:46,300
<43-23,BECKETT>潜入你的办公室  想要拿走你的东西
<43-23,BECKETT>that night trying to take what was yours --

815
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,790
<43-24,ESPOSITO>你抄起拨火棍  杀了她
<43-24,ESPOSITO>You grabbed the fireplace poker and you killed her.

816
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:51,060
<43-25,ROGER>不  你们在我家出现之前
<43-25,ROGER>No! I didn't even know Sadie was trying to steal the tape

817
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,900
<43-25,ROGER>我都不知道桑迪想偷录像带
<43-25,ROGER>until you guys showed up at my house earlier.

818
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:55,570
<43-26,BECKETT>那就证明一下  谋杀发生时你在哪儿
<43-26,BECKETT>Prove it. Where were you at the time of the murder?

819
00:33:58,110 --> 00:33:59,820
<43-27,ROGER>你们保证别告诉我妻子
<43-27,ROGER>Do you promise not to tell my wife?

820
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:02,440
<43-27,ROGER>我当时在地下室里
<43-27,ROGER>I was in the basement

821
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,550
<43-27,ROGER>跟奇普·埃文斯和莱斯特·戴维斯一起吸大麻
<43-27,ROGER>getting baked with Chip Evans and Lester Davis.

822
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:07,180
<43-27,ROGER>我撒谎是因为我向妻子保证不再吸毒了
<43-27,ROGER>I lied because I promised my wife that I would stop toking.

823
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:11,060
<43-27,ROGER>我最近压力很大
<43-27,ROGER>It's just... I'm under a lot of stress lately.

824
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,120
<44-1,CASTLE>告诉我你破案了
<44-1,CASTLE>Please tell me you solved it.

825
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:17,100
<44-2,BECKETT>罗杰的不在场证明成立
<44-2,BECKETT>Roger's alibi checks out.

826
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,570
<44-2,BECKETT>我们又回到原点而且毫无头绪
<44-2,BECKETT>We're back to square one with zero leads.

827
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:20,800
<44-2,BECKETT>维勒那边有什么进展吗
<44-2,BECKETT>Any luck with Weller?

828
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:22,180
<44-3,CASTLE>他一心想让她被定罪
<44-3,CASTLE>All he cares about is getting a conviction,

829
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:23,670
<44-3,CASTLE>从陪审团得知妮娜和桑迪的关系后
<44-3,CASTLE>and from the look of the jury when they found out

830
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:26,030
<44-3,CASTLE>的表情判断  他会成功的
<44-3,CASTLE>about Nina and Sadie's affair, he's gonna get it.

831
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:27,510
<44-4,BECKETT>我们得想出个办法来
<44-4,BECKETT>We need to figure something out.

832
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:29,990
<44-5,CASTLE>我有个主意
<44-5,CASTLE>I have an idea.

833
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:31,920
<44-6,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你要干什么
<44-6,BECKETT>Castle, what are you doing?

834
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:33,790
<44-7,CASTLE>拯救无辜女人的性命
<44-7,CASTLE>Saving an innocent woman's life.

835
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:37,040
<45-2,CASTLE>-布朗先生  你的目击者  -停止审判
<45-2,CASTLE>- Mr. Brown, your witness. - Stop the trial!

836
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:46,290
<45-3,BECKETT>好吧  现在怎么办
<45-3,BECKETT>Okay, so...now what?

837
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,720
<45-4,CASTLE>我不知道  我没考虑这之后怎么做
<45-4,CASTLE>I don't know. I didn't think this one all the way through.

838
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,640
<46-1,CASTLE>法官阁下  你好  很高兴再次见到你
<46-1,CASTLE>Hello, your honor. Nice to see you again.

839
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,370
<46-2,JUDGE WOLLCOTT>你想再进一次拘留所吗  卡塞尔先生
<46-2,JUDGE WOLLCOTT>Hoping to make another visit to the holding cells, Mr. Castle?

840
00:34:58,370 --> 00:35:00,180
<46-3,CASTLE>不  法官阁下  进过一次就够了  谢谢
<46-3,CASTLE>No, your honor. Once was plenty, thank you.

841
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:02,340
<46-3,CASTLE>我为打断您而致以诚挚歉意
<46-3,CASTLE>And my sincerest apologies for the interruption.

842
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:05,110
<46-3,CASTLE>然而  案情有进一步进展
<46-3,CASTLE>However, there has been a development in the case.

843
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,220
<46-4,BECKETT>抱歉  法官阁下
<46-4,BECKETT>Excuse us, your honor,

844
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:10,110
<46-4,BECKETT>辩方律师想让目击者出庭作证
<46-4,BECKETT>but the defense has a witness to call to the stand.

845
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:13,710
<46-5,BROWN>法官阁下  辩方律师想让
<46-5,BROWN>Uh, your honor, the defense would like to call

846
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:15,620
<46-5,BROWN>理查德·卡塞尔出庭作证
<46-5,BROWN>Richard Castle to the stand.

847
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,490
<46-6,BECKETT>肯定不是妮娜干的
<46-6,BECKETT>So, Nina definitely didn't do it.

848
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:24,040
<46-7,BROWN>说点我不知道的东西  比如是谁干的
<46-7,BROWN>Tell me something I don't know, like who did.

849
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:25,330
<46-8,BECKETT>不知道
<46-8,BECKETT>No idea.

850
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:26,910
<46-9,BAILIFF>你发誓你说的是事实  完全真实
<46-9,BAILIFF>Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth,

851
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:28,700
<46-9,BAILIFF>-绝对真实  -我发誓
<46-9,BAILIFF>- and nothing but the truth? - I do.

852
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:31,360
<46-10,CASTLE>看来最后我真的再来一次了
<46-10,CASTLE>Looks like I got my do-over after all.

853
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:38,550
<46-11,BROWN>卡塞尔先生  昨天你作证说
<46-11,BROWN>Mr. Castle, yesterday, you testified

854
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:41,760
<46-11,BROWN>我的委托人因杀死比克曼太太而有罪
<46-11,BROWN>that my client was guilty of killing Mrs. Beakman.

855
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,430
<46-11,BROWN>你还相信那是真的吗
<46-11,BROWN>Do you still believe that's true?

856
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:45,620
<46-12,CASTLE>不  妮娜是清白的
<46-12,CASTLE>No. Nina's innocent.

857
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,440
<46-13,BROWN>好  那我再问你
<46-13,BROWN>Okay, and when, may I ask,

858
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,460
<46-13,BROWN>你什么时候改变了对我委托人的看法
<46-13,BROWN>did you change your mind about my client?

859
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:54,280
<46-14,CASTLE>我意识到妮娜是受害者
<46-14,CASTLE>When I realized that Nina was a victim.

860
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:55,760
<46-14,CASTLE>不凑巧的受害者
<46-14,CASTLE>Victim of bad timing.

861
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,490
<46-14,CASTLE>首先是我自己不凑巧
<46-14,CASTLE>First and foremost, my own.

862
00:35:57,490 --> 00:35:59,220
<46-15,BROWN>你说不凑巧
<46-15,BROWN>Bad timing, you say?

863
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,600
<46-16,CASTLE>我不凑巧
<46-16,CASTLE>It was my bad timing

864
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,440
<46-16,CASTLE>抵达犯罪现场已经太晚了
<46-16,CASTLE>that brought me to the crime scene too late.

865
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,840
<46-16,CASTLE>如果当时我早点到那儿
<46-16,CASTLE>Had I gotten there earlier,

866
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:07,010
<46-16,CASTLE>我就会看见妮娜发现桑迪已经遇刺
<46-16,CASTLE>I would've seen Nina finding Sadie already stabbed.

867
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:10,030
<46-17,BROWN>好  但我的委托人逃跑了
<46-17,BROWN>Okay, but then my client ran.

868
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:12,640
<46-17,BROWN>-为什么  -因为她知道这看起来是什么样
<46-17,BROWN>- Why? - Because she knew how it looked.

869
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:14,480
<46-18,CASTLE>既然我们说到不凑巧
<46-18,CASTLE>While we're on the topic of bad timing,

870
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,060
<46-18,CASTLE>那就别忘了提一下
<46-18,CASTLE>let's not fail to mention the timing

871
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:18,310
<46-18,CASTLE>原来指派给妮娜的公设辩护律师
<46-18,CASTLE>of Nina originally being paired with a public defender

872
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:20,730
<46-18,CASTLE>完全不在乎事情真相  不像你  先生
<46-18,CASTLE>who didn't care about the truth, unlike you, sir.

873
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:24,960
<46-19,BROWN>卡塞尔先生  有没有其他事
<46-19,BROWN>Um...well, Mr. Castle, is there anything --

874
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,390
<46-19,BROWN>-你想对法庭说的吗  -有
<46-19,BROWN>- is there anything else you'd like to share with the court? - Yes.

875
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:29,980
<46-20,CASTLE>尊敬的陪审团  想想真是可怕
<46-20,CASTLE>Good people of the jury, it is frightening to think about,

876
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,960
<46-20,CASTLE>妮娜·奥基弗今天受审
<46-20,CASTLE>but Nina O'keefe is on trial today

877
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,910
<46-20,CASTLE>仅仅是因为我需要上洗手间
<46-20,CASTLE>simply because I needed to use the restroom

878
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:35,480
<46-20,CASTLE>而楼下的那个
<46-20,CASTLE>and the one downstairs...

879
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:40,870
<46-20,CASTLE>不凑巧
<46-20,CASTLE>Bad timing.

880
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:45,240
<46-21,CASTLE>楼下的洗手间有人
<46-21,CASTLE>The bathroom downstairs was occupied.

881
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,970
<46-21,CASTLE>打911
<46-21,CASTLE>Call 911!

882
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:51,540
<47-1,CASTLE>打911
<47-1,CASTLE>Call 911!

883
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:54,360
<47-2,CASTLE>我冲到房子后面
<47-2,CASTLE>I was rushing through to the back of the house,

884
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:57,680
<47-2,CASTLE>以为妮娜是凶手而她在逃跑
<47-2,CASTLE>thinking Nina was the killer and that she was getting away,

885
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,570
<47-2,CASTLE>但是真正的凶手根本没有离开
<47-2,CASTLE>but the true killer never left.

886
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:01,920
<47-2,CASTLE>真正的凶手
<47-2,CASTLE>The true killer...

887
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:06,040
<47-2,CASTLE>还在那个洗手间里  清理他穿过后院
<47-2,CASTLE>was still in that bathroom, cleaning the mud from his shoes,

888
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:09,710
<47-2,CASTLE>往返杀害桑迪时
<47-2,CASTLE>the mud he collected trudging through the backyard...

889
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:13,690
<48-1,CASTLE>沾到鞋上的泥
<48-1,CASTLE>...to and from killing Sadie.

890
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,890
<48-2,BROWN>卡塞尔先生  你看到这个人了吗
<48-2,BROWN>Mr. Castle, did you see this man?

891
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,380
<48-3,CASTLE>看到了  说起不凑巧
<48-3,CASTLE>Yeah. Talk about bad timing.

892
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:20,960
<48-3,CASTLE>他出来的时候我刚好看到他
<48-3,CASTLE>He came out just in time for me to catch him.

893
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,610
<48-4,BROWN>你能在法庭上指出这个人吗
<48-4,BROWN>Can you point to this man in this courtroom?

894
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:26,220
<48-4,BROWN>那个杀死桑迪·比克曼的凶手
<48-4,BROWN>The man who killed Sadie Beakman?

895
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:27,290
<48-5,CASTLE>是的  我可以
<48-5,CASTLE>Yes, I can.

896
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:31,420
<48-5,CASTLE>就是她的丈夫  罗伊德·比克曼
<48-5,CASTLE>It was her husband, Lloyd Beakman.

897
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:35,410
<48-6,LLYOD>胡说八道
<48-6,LLYOD>How dare you.

898
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:38,960
<48-7,ANNIE>等等  你和妈妈同时在派对上消失的
<48-7,ANNIE>Wait, you and mom disappeared from the party at the same time.

899
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:42,390
<48-7,ANNIE>我记得是因为我当时试图找你们
<48-7,ANNIE>No, I-I remember because I was trying to find you guys.

900
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:44,460
<48-8,JUDGE WOLLCOTT>好了  够了  肃静
<48-8,JUDGE WOLLCOTT>All right, that's enough. I want order.

901
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,830
<48-9,BECKETT>很抱歉打扰庭审  法官阁下
<48-9,BECKETT>Apologies to the court, Your Honor.

902
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:49,090
<48-9,BECKETT>乔安娜·马特斯以为桑迪
<48-9,BECKETT>Joanna Masters thought that Sadie

903
00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:51,230
<48-9,BECKETT>和她的丈夫罗杰有染
<48-9,BECKETT>was having an affair with her husband, Roger,

904
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:53,820
<48-9,BECKETT>但是她错了  你也一样
<48-9,BECKETT>but she was wrong, and so were you.

905
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:56,370
<48-10,LLOYD>我完全不知道你在说什么
<48-10,LLOYD>I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.

906
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:57,440
<48-10,LLOYD>你当然知道
<48-10,LLOYD>Sure, you do.

907
00:37:57,570 --> 00:37:59,800
<48-11,BECKETT>你看见你的妻子向楼梯上走去
<48-11,BECKETT>You saw your wife head up those stairs.

908
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:02,680
<48-11,BECKETT>你很怀疑  她以前出过轨
<48-11,BECKETT>You had your suspicions. She had cheated on you before.

909
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:04,810
<48-11,BECKETT>所以你走到院子里
<48-11,BECKETT>So you headed out to the yard,

910
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:06,760
<48-11,BECKETT>把篮球框挪过去
<48-11,BECKETT>you moved the basketball hoop over

911
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,910
<48-11,BECKETT>这样你就能爬上去看个清楚
<48-11,BECKETT>so you could climb up it and get a better look.

912
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:12,160
<48-12,CASTLE>但是桑迪发现你在窗户上偷看  对不对
<48-12,CASTLE>But Sadie caught you spying in the window, didn't she?

913
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:13,160
<48-12,CASTLE>所以你爬进去
<48-12,CASTLE>So you came inside

914
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:15,430
<48-12,CASTLE>指责她和罗杰有染
<48-12,CASTLE>and accused her of having an affair with Roger.

915
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:17,020
<48-13,ANNIE>爸爸  你做了什么
<48-13,ANNIE>Dad, what did you do?

916
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:18,660
<48-13,ANNIE>我做了什么
<48-13,ANNIE>What did I do?

917
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:24,650
<48-14,LLOYD>你妈妈红杏出墙  还是和她
<48-14,LLOYD>Your mother was having an affair with... her, of all people.

918
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:27,870
<48-14,LLOYD>而你妈妈觉得我一直以为是罗杰真是太好笑了
<48-14,LLOYD>And it was so funny to your mother that I assumed it was Roger.

919
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:29,770
<48-14,LLOYD>她简直乐不可支
<48-14,LLOYD>She laughed and laughed.

920
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:31,740
<48-15,BECKETT>所以你的确和桑迪在楼上
<48-15,BECKETT>So you were upstairs with Sadie.

921
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:34,520
<48-16,LLOYD>我  我的意思是
<48-16,LLOYD>W-w-w-what I meant was --

922
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,580
<48-17,BECKETT>发生了什么  罗伊德  你失去理智了吗
<48-17,BECKETT>What happened, Lloyd? Did you lose control?

923
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:38,310
<48-17,BECKETT>那就是你杀她的原因吗
<48-17,BECKETT>Is that why you killed her?

924
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:45,060
<48-18,LLOYD>我不是故意的  我没想杀她
<48-18,LLOYD>I didn't mean to. I didn't mean it.

925
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:46,440
<48-18,LLOYD>我爱桑迪  可我只是
<48-18,LLOYD>I loved Sadie, but I just --

926
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,850
<48-19,BROWN>比克曼先生  我建议你
<48-19,BROWN>Mr. Beakman, my advice to you

927
00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:51,010
<48-19,BROWN>住嘴然后给自己找一个律师
<48-19,BROWN>would be to stop talking and find yourself an attorney.

928
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:53,440
<48-20,BECKETT>比克曼先生  你因为谋杀被捕了
<48-20,BECKETT>Mr. Beakman, you're under arrest for murder.

<49-4,BECKETT>不  那不是我们的错
<49-4,BECKETT>No, that one's not on us.

939
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:23,090
<49-4,BECKETT>这是妮娜原来的辩护律师的错
<49-4,BECKETT>Nina's original defense attorney did that to her.

940
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:25,860
<49-4,BECKETT>到最后  是我们还她公道
<49-4,BECKETT>At the end of the day, we're the ones who brought her justice.

941
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:27,610

<49-10,VIKRAM>不  他们说的没错

949
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:47,780
<49-11,BECKETT>我是说  卡莱布是恶魔  但我们今天看到的是
<49-11,BECKETT>I mean, Caleb is a monster, but what we learned today

950
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:50,990
<49-11,BECKETT>他是一个极尽所能为善的恶魔
<49-11,BECKETT>is that he is a monster who is desperate to do good.

<49-12,VIKRAM>所以呢
<49-12,VIKRAM>So?

952
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,170

<50-2,BECKETT>也许你应该换个路线
<50-2,BECKETT>Maybe you should try a new genre.

959
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:13,150
<50-3,CASTLE>也许我应该努力不要再出庭作证
