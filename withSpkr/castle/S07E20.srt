00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:00,700
<1-3,MARTHA>不不  我是作为担心的母亲这样说
<1-3,MARTHA>No, no, no. I'm speaking as a concerned mother.

8
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,400
<1-3,MARTHA>你真不是病了吗
<1-3,MARTHA>Are you sure you're not coming down with anything?

9
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,750
<1-4,CASTLE>没有啊  感觉棒棒的
<1-4,CASTLE>Not at all. Never better.

11
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,900
<1-5,MARTHA>那好  那我的任务完成了
<1-5,MARTHA>Well, good. Then my work here is done.

12
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,900
<1-5,MARTHA>我要去看些开放住宅了
<1-5,MARTHA>I'm off to see some open houses.

14
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:11,200
<1-5,MARTHA>希望能找到称心如愿的公寓  再见了
<1-5,MARTHA>Hopefully to find the apartment of my dreams. Ta!

15
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:11,990
<1-6,KATE BECKETT>再见
<1-6,KATE BECKETT>Bye.

17
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:13,960
<1-6,KATE BECKETT>-再见  -再见
<1-6,KATE BECKETT>- Ta! - Bye.

18
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,470
<1-8,CASTLE>谢谢
<1-8,CASTLE>Ah, thank you.

19
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:20,230
<1-10,BECKETT>阿丽克西斯也走了吗
<1-10,BECKETT>Is Alexis gone, too?

20
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:22,440
<1-12,BECKETT>嗯  她早上有课
<1-12,BECKETT>Yeah. She had an early-morning class.

21
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:25,920
<1-12,BECKETT>你昨晚又睡得不安稳
<1-12,BECKETT>So, you were restless again last night.

22
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,990
<1-12,BECKETT>怎么回事
<1-12,BECKETT>What's going on?

23
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:27,980
<1-13,CASTLE>没什么啊
<1-13,CASTLE>Nothing.

24
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:31,200
<1-14,BECKETT>亲爱的  你总那么说  但情况却越来越糟
<1-14,BECKETT>Babe, you keep saying that, and it keeps getting worse.

25
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,330
<1-14,BECKETT>你在睡梦中幽咽
<1-14,BECKETT>You were whimpering in your sleep.

26
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:35,370
<1-14,BECKETT>这一周每晚都如此
<1-14,BECKETT>It's been every night for a week.

27
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,020
<1-14,BECKETT>说吧  告诉我
<1-14,BECKETT>So, come on. Talk to me.

28
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,110
<1-15,CASTLE>就是个梦
<1-15,CASTLE>It's just a dream.

29
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,220
<1-16,BECKETT>那么这梦你一直做喽
<1-16,BECKETT>So it's a recurring dream?

30
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,330
<1-16,BECKETT>好吧  内容是什么
<1-16,BECKETT>Okay. About what?

31
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,920
<1-17,CASTLE>好像是我失踪期间的事
<1-17,CASTLE>About when I went missing, I think.

32
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,680
<1-18,BECKETT>那你为什么不跟我说呢
<1-18,BECKETT>And so why didn't you want to tell me about it?

33
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,820
<1-19,CASTLE>大概是因为我不想小题大做吧
<1-19,CASTLE>Probably because I didn't want to make a big deal of it.

34
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:58,250
<1-20,BECKETT>但这不是小题  你失去了生命中的两个月
<1-20,BECKETT>But it is a big deal. You lost two months of your life.

35
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,920
<1-20,BECKETT>如今又开始梦到
<1-20,BECKETT>And you're dreaming about it now?

36
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,070
<1-20,BECKETT>-我觉得你不该无视  -我觉得应该
<1-20,BECKETT>- I don't think you should ignore this. - I do.

37
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:05,260
<1-21,CASTLE>拜托  现在一切都很完美
<1-21,CASTLE>Come on. Everything is perfect right now.

38
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:08,360
<1-21,CASTLE>我们很快乐  其他人也是
<1-21,CASTLE>You and I are in a great place. Everyone else is.

39
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,930
<1-21,CASTLE>何必再去深究呢
<1-21,CASTLE>I mean, why go turning over stones

40
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,520
<1-21,CASTLE>这些梦可能渐渐就停止了
<1-21,CASTLE>when the dreams will just probably just go away?

41
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,830
<1-22,BECKETT>但是并没有停止啊  而且越来越糟
<1-22,BECKETT>Except they haven't gone away. They're just getting worse.

42
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,590
<1-22,BECKETT>看你啊  你压力很大
<1-22,BECKETT>Look at you. You're stressed-out.

43
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:16,790
<1-22,BECKETT>精疲力竭
<1-22,BECKETT>You're exhausted.

44
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:19,510
<1-22,BECKETT>你一周都一个字没写了
<1-22,BECKETT>You haven't written a word in a week.

45
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,780
<1-22,BECKETT>至少考虑去看医生吧
<1-22,BECKETT>Look, a-at least consider seeing someone.

46
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,880
<1-22,BECKETT>我认识可能能帮到你的人
<1-22,BECKETT>I know somebody who may be able to help.

47
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:32,480
<1-22,BECKETT>以前进行过心理治疗吗  卡塞尔先生
<1-22,BECKETT>Have you ever sought therapy before, Mr. Castle?

48
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,570
<2-1,CASTLE>如果你见过我母亲
<2-1,CASTLE>Well, if you'd met my mother,

49
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,810
<2-1,CASTLE>你就会知道答案是肯定的
<2-1,CASTLE>you'd know the answer would be yes,

50
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:38,940
<2-1,CASTLE>但我生来不喜欢反省
<2-1,CASTLE>but, uh, by my nature, I try to avoid introspection.

51
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,510
<2-2,BURKE>那我们开始吧
<2-2,BURKE>Well, let's get started.

52
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,090
<2-2,BURKE>能跟我说说你失忆的时期吗
<2-2,BURKE>What can you tell me about your missing time?

53
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:46,610
<2-2,BURKE>没多少好说的
<2-2,BURKE>Not much.

54
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:49,910
<2-3,CASTLE>我记得的最后一件事  是开车去婚礼
<2-3,CASTLE>The last thing I remember, I was driving to my wedding.

55
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,990
<2-3,CASTLE>一辆黑SUV开始追车
<2-3,CASTLE>A black S.U.V. started chasing me.

56
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:54,760
<2-3,CASTLE>我被逼冲下了路
<2-3,CASTLE>Then I was forced off the road.

57
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,580
<2-3,CASTLE>两个月后
<2-3,CASTLE>Two months later,

58
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,580
<2-3,CASTLE>他们在大西洋上发现了我
<2-3,CASTLE>they found me in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.

59
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,190
<2-3,CASTLE>我得过登革热
<2-3,CASTLE>I had been exposed to dengue fever.

60
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:06,630
<2-3,CASTLE>我身上有弹痕  但完全不记得怎么回事
<2-3,CASTLE>I had a bullet scar with no recollection how I got it,

61
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,560
<2-3,CASTLE>我什么都不记得
<2-3,CASTLE>no memory of anything.

62
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,240
<2-3,CASTLE>我找到了一个叫詹金斯的人
<2-3,CASTLE>I tracked down a man named Jenkins,

63
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,670
<2-3,CASTLE>他不知为何与这事有关
<2-3,CASTLE>who was involved somehow.

64
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:12,730
<2-3,CASTLE>他
<2-3,CASTLE>He, uh...

65
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,980
<2-3,CASTLE>他说我之所以想不起来
<2-3,CASTLE>He told me the reason I couldn't remember.

66
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,610
<2-4,HENRY JENKINS>你说过你不想记得
<2-4,HENRY JENKINS>And you said you didn't want to remember.

67
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:22,670
<2-4,HENRY JENKINS>我们竭尽全力确保你不记得
<2-4,HENRY JENKINS>We went to great lengths to make sure that you didn't.

68
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:25,240
<3-1,BURKE>那么你还是不想记起来吗
<3-1,BURKE>And is it still the case that you don't want to remember?

69
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,330
<3-1,BURKE>不
<3-1,BURKE>No.

70
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,450
<3-2,CASTLE>我也试图将这事遗忘
<3-2,CASTLE>I-I've tried to put it behind me,

71
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:34,650
<3-2,CASTLE>但这事让我无法释怀
<3-2,CASTLE>but it haunts me.

72
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,240
<3-2,CASTLE>每一天我都在想  我去了哪  看到了什么
<3-2,CASTLE>Not a day goes by I don't wonder where I was, what I saw...

73
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:41,830
<3-2,CASTLE>做了什么
<3-2,CASTLE>what I did.

74
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:47,180
<3-2,CASTLE>我的记忆是不是在恢复了
<3-2,CASTLE>Is it possible my memories are coming back?

75
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:50,370
<3-3,BURKE>梦境有时候的确是记忆
<3-3,BURKE>Well, dreams can be memories.

76
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,370
<3-3,BURKE>但更多时候只是象征性的
<3-3,BURKE>But more often they're symbolic...

77
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:55,330
<3-3,BURKE>是一个问题的隐喻性表达
<3-3,BURKE>Metaphoric expressions of an issue or problem.

78
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:57,670
<3-3,BURKE>而且你是个作家  很有创作性
<3-3,BURKE>You're also a writer... a creative person.

79
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:00,430
<3-3,BURKE>这或许是你的大脑在建立一套
<3-3,BURKE>This could mean your mind is building a narrative

80
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,320
<3-3,BURKE>填补这两个月空白的理论
<3-3,BURKE>to fill a two-month void.

81
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:07,100
<3-4,CASTLE>我也想理解这些梦境
<3-4,CASTLE>I want to understand these dreams...

82
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:11,570
<3-4,CASTLE>他们的含义  他们是否是真的
<3-4,CASTLE>What they mean and, uh... if they're real.

83
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,280
<3-5,BURKE>可以让你进入放松状态
<3-5,BURKE>Well, we could put you in a relaxed state,

84
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,230
<3-5,BURKE>回顾那段经历
<3-5,BURKE>try to revisit the experience.

85
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,560
<3-6,CASTLE>催眠吗
<3-6,CASTLE>Hypnosis?

86
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,470
<4-1,BURKE>如果你想记笔记  你有笔和纸
<4-1,BURKE>You have a pen and paper if you wish to take notes.

87
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:27,150
<4-1,BURKE>你随时可以睁眼  醒来
<4-1,BURKE>You may open your eyes and awaken at any time.

88
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,750
<4-1,BURKE>可以开始了吗  卡塞尔先生
<4-1,BURKE>Are you ready to begin, Mr. Castle?

89
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,500
<4-2,CASTLE>是的
<4-2,CASTLE>Yeah.

90
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:38,180
<4-3,BURKE>回顾你能记得的梦境中第一个画面
<4-3,BURKE>Go back to the first image you can recall of your dream.

91
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,610
<4-3,BURKE>你看到了什么
<4-3,BURKE>What do you see?

92
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,360
<4-4,CASTLE>我睡在一艘船上
<4-4,CASTLE>I'm asleep on a boat.

93
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:45,710
<4-4,CASTLE>在大海里
<4-4,CASTLE>On the ocean.

94
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,000
<4-4,CASTLE>好久不见啊  里克
<4-4,CASTLE>Long time, Rick.

95
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,280
<4-4,CASTLE>有个人  他跟我打招呼
<4-4,CASTLE>There's a man there. He says hi to me.

96
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,070
<4-4,CASTLE>好久不见啊  里克
<4-4,CASTLE>Long time, Rick.

97
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:57,100
<4-4,CASTLE>他认识我
<4-4,CASTLE>He knows me.

98
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,300
<4-5,BURKE>你认识他吗
<4-5,BURKE>Do you know him?

99
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:02,010
<4-6,CASTLE>他很眼熟  但我说不上是谁
<4-6,CASTLE>He's familiar, but I-I can't...place him.

100
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:05,890
<4-6,CASTLE>这很有效啊
<4-6,CASTLE>This really works.

101
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,350
<4-6,CASTLE>好了  这个很眼熟
<4-6,CASTLE>Okay, there's something familiar.

102
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,630
<4-6,CASTLE>一个奖杯
<4-6,CASTLE>A trophy.

103
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,810
<4-7,BURKE>比赛的奖杯吗
<4-7,BURKE>For some kind of sport?

104
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,730
<4-8,CASTLE>或许吧  我分辨不出来
<4-8,CASTLE>Maybe. I-I can't tell.

105
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:19,030
<4-8,CASTLE>有人开枪
<4-8,CASTLE>Now someone's firing a pistol.

106
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:21,830
<4-8,CASTLE>我看到了血
<4-8,CASTLE>I see blood.

107
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:24,260
<4-8,CASTLE>地上有个人
<4-8,CASTLE>There's a man on the floor.

108
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:27,090
<4-8,CASTLE>他中枪了  他要死了
<4-8,CASTLE>He's been shot. He's dying.

109
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,430
<4-8,CASTLE>我也在
<4-8,CASTLE>I'm there, too.

110
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,390
<4-8,CASTLE>我化了迷彩妆
<4-8,CASTLE>I'm wearing camouflage paint.

111
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:34,600
<4-8,CASTLE>我想帮他
<4-8,CASTLE>I'm trying to help him, but...

112
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:37,470
<4-9,BURKE>你能看到自己的位置吗
<4-9,BURKE>Can you see where you are right now?

113
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:39,800
<4-10,CASTLE>在一个仓库
<4-10,CASTLE>In a storage shed.

114
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:42,950
<4-10,CASTLE>但一切东西都在动
<4-10,CASTLE>But it seems like everything is moving.

115
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:52,010
<4-10,CASTLE>我在一辆卡车里
<4-10,CASTLE>I'm in a truck.

116
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,930
<4-10,CASTLE>我们在丛林里
<4-10,CASTLE>We're in the jungle.

117
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:57,020
<4-10,CASTLE>有人在追我们
<4-10,CASTLE>And there's someone chasing us.

118
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,740
<4-10,CASTLE>他们在冲我们开枪
<4-10,CASTLE>They're shooting at us.

119
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:13,760
<4-10,CASTLE>卡车上有个金发的男人
<4-10,CASTLE>There's a blond man in a truck.

120
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,260
<4-10,CASTLE>他在带领他们
<4-10,CASTLE>He's leading the charge.

121
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,150
<4-10,CASTLE>再快点
<4-10,CASTLE>Faster!

122
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:19,730
<4-11,BURKE>-军用卡车吗  -不  是民用的
<4-11,BURKE>- A military truck? - No, it's a civilian truck.

123
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,110
<4-12,CASTLE>但有很
<4-12,CASTLE>But it has a very...

124
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:23,800
<4-12,CASTLE>奇怪的
<4-12,CASTLE>...strange...

125
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,360
<4-13,CASTLE>车牌
<4-13,CASTLE>...license plate.

126
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,220
<4-14,BURKE>你看到了查克·诺里斯
<4-14,BURKE>So the man you saw was Chuck Norris?

127
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:56,980
<4-14,BURKE>不  他不是
<4-14,BURKE>No, he wasn't...

128
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,520
<4-15,CASTLE>查克·诺里斯  当然不会
<4-15,CASTLE>...Chuck Norris. Of course not.

129
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,000
<4-15,CASTLE>那就太荒唐
<4-15,CASTLE>I mean, that would be ridiculous and...

130
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:02,810
<4-15,CASTLE>也太酷了
<4-15,CASTLE>Super-duper cool.

131
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:04,970
<4-15,CASTLE>不是  他看上去像查克·诺里斯
<4-15,CASTLE>But, no. He... he looked like Chuck Norris.

132
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:09,100
<4-16,BURKE>第一次会面颇有成效啊
<4-16,BURKE>Well, this was a very productive first session,

133
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:12,310
<4-16,BURKE>卡塞尔先生  不过时间到了
<4-16,BURKE>Mr. Castle, but I'm afraid our time is up.

134
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:14,010
<4-16,BURKE>好的  谢谢
<4-16,BURKE>Of course. Thank you.

135
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,270
<4-17,CASTLE>博克医生  我
<4-17,CASTLE>Uh, Dr. Burke, can I, uh...

136
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,850
<4-17,CASTLE>明天能再见你吗
<4-17,CASTLE>Can I see you again tomorrow?

137
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:21,110
<4-18,BURKE>我看看日程吧  但我希望你
<4-18,BURKE>Well, I'll check, but I want you to think

138
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,810
<4-18,BURKE>能好好想想梦境的含义
<4-18,BURKE>about the underlying meaning of the dream.

139
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:27,640
<4-18,BURKE>别把梦境当成真实的记忆
<4-18,BURKE>Now, don't assume that the images are actual memories.

140
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,830
<5-1,CASTLE>告诉你们
<5-1,CASTLE>I'm telling you, guys.

141
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:35,870
<5-1,CASTLE>我毫不怀疑  那就是我真实的记忆
<5-1,CASTLE>There's no doubt in my mind. They are actual memories.

142
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:38,570
<5-2,BECKETT>尽管博克医生说可能不是的
<5-2,BECKETT>Even though Dr. Burke said they might not be?

143
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:40,300
<5-3,CASTLE>那是我们第一次会面
<5-3,CASTLE>It...was our first session.

144
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,570
<5-3,CASTLE>他只是保守  但感觉好真实
<5-3,CASTLE>He was just being cautious. But they felt real.

145
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:43,880
<5-3,CASTLE>因为那就是真实的
<5-3,CASTLE>Because they... they are real.

146
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:47,190
<5-4,JAVIER ESPOSITO>那么你跟查克·诺里斯在丛林里跟人械斗吗
<5-4,JAVIER ESPOSITO>So you were in jungle combat? With Chuck Norris.

147
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,840
<5-5,KEVIN RYAN>就像《杀出火地狱》那样吗
<5-5,KEVIN RYAN>Like "Missing in action"?

148
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:51,850
<5-5,KEVIN RYAN>他拍的那部在越南营救战俘的电影吗
<5-5,KEVIN RYAN>The movie he did about rescuing P.O.W.s from vietnam?

149
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:53,620
<5-6,CASTLE>但那不是查克·诺里斯  也不是电影
<5-6,CASTLE>Uh, only it wasn't Chuck Norris, it wasn't a movie,

150
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,940
<5-7,ESPOSITO>-我也不在越南  -这是没错
<5-7,ESPOSITO>- and I wasn't in Vietnam. - You got that right.

151
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:58,480
<5-8,CASTLE>因为托瑞正在查的车牌
<5-8,CASTLE>Because the license plate that tory is checking on...

152
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,730
<5-8,CASTLE>就是我看到的那个  上面有阿拉伯字母
<5-8,CASTLE>the one I saw... it had Arabic characters.

153
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,360
<5-9,BECKETT>说阿拉伯语有丛林的国家
<5-9,BECKETT>Okay, so an Arabic-speaking country with a jungle?

154
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,270
<5-9,BECKETT>也门  索马里
<5-9,BECKETT>Um...Yemen... Somalia.

155
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,020
<5-10,CASTLE>嗯  差不多
<5-10,CASTLE>Yeah, I guess so.

156
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,990
<5-10,CASTLE>等我们找到和查克·诺里斯长得像的那个人
<5-10,CASTLE>We'll know more when we track down

157
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,720
<5-10,CASTLE>就能知道更多了
<5-10,CASTLE>that Chuck Norris look-alike.

158
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,240
<5-11,RYAN>你打算怎么找呢
<5-11,RYAN>How do you plan on doing that?

159
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,490
<5-12,CASTLE>我跟你们说的那个军队骷髅纹身
<5-12,CASTLE>That military skull tattoo I told you about.

160
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:15,290
<5-12,CASTLE>可以利用纹身确认他  对吧
<5-12,CASTLE>That could help I.D. him, right?

161
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,900
<5-13,ESPOSITO>我们尽力去查吧
<5-13,ESPOSITO>We'll see what we can find out.

162
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,730
<5-13,ESPOSITO>不过希望不是很大
<5-13,ESPOSITO>But it's a long shot at best.

163
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:28,540
<5-14,CASTLE>我知道这似乎是不可能的
<5-14,CASTLE>I know this seems impossible.

164
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,600
<5-15,BECKETT>我们很多案子一开始都是这样
<5-15,BECKETT>A lot of our cases do at first.

165
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:32,090
<5-15,BECKETT>现在有了些线索  卡塞尔
<5-15,BECKETT>There's something there, Castle,

166
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:34,190
<5-15,BECKETT>所以我们就顺着线索查  看看会有什么结果
<5-15,BECKETT>so we'll just follow it and see where it leads.

167
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,490
<5-16,TORY ELLIS>我查到一些车牌的情况
<5-16,TORY ELLIS>I got something on that license plate.

168
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:38,570
<6-1,TORY>原来那些不是阿拉伯语
<6-1,TORY>It turns out, this isn't Arabic.

169
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:40,920
<6-1,TORY>是泰文的字母
<6-1,TORY>These are letters in the Thai alphabet.

170
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:42,040
<6-2,BECKETT>什么意思
<6-2,BECKETT>What does it mean?

171
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:44,420
<6-3,TORY>车牌的注册地是清迈
<6-3,TORY>That the license plate was registered in Chiang Mai,

172
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,910
<6-3,TORY>泰国北部的一个省
<6-3,TORY>a province in northern Thailand.

173
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,290
<6-4,CASTLE>我去了泰国
<6-4,CASTLE>I was in Thailand,

174
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:53,210
<6-4,CASTLE>跟查克·诺里斯一起被人追杀吗
<6-4,CASTLE>getting shot at with Chuck Norris?

184
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,650
<6-4,CASTLE>凯特
<6-4,CASTLE>Kate?

185
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,340
<7-1,ALEXIS CASTLE>凯特  你醒了吗
<7-1,ALEXIS CASTLE>Kate, are you awake?

186
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:14,450
<7-2,BECKETT>阿丽克西斯
<7-2,BECKETT>Alexis, hey.

187
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,670
<7-2,BECKETT>怎么  怎么了
<7-2,BECKETT>What's -- what's wrong?

188
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,620
<7-3,ALEXIS>抱歉  我有个考试
<7-3,ALEXIS>Sorry. I have an exam,

189
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,990
<7-3,ALEXIS>但爸爸这样子我不能直接走掉
<7-3,ALEXIS>but I didn't want to leave dad like this.

190
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:24,210
<7-3,ALEXIS>他研究泰国那事太专注了
<7-3,ALEXIS>He's kind of gone off the deep end about thailand.

191
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,190
<7-3,ALEXIS>你一晚都没睡吗
<7-3,ALEXIS>Hey. Were you up all night?

192
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:47,350
<8-1,BECKETT>我在研究在我失踪期间
<8-1,BECKETT>I'm researching armed conflicts

193
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:50,180
<8-2,CASTLE>发生在泰国北部的武装冲突
<8-2,CASTLE>in northern Thailand during the time I was missing.

194
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,510
<8-2,CASTLE>我肯定是卷入到其中了
<8-2,CASTLE>Somehow, I must have been part of one of them.

195
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:53,600
<8-3,BECKETT>你发现什么了吗
<8-3,BECKETT>You find anything?

196
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,720
<8-4,CASTLE>没有  还没有  不过会发现的
<8-4,CASTLE>No, not yet. But I will.

197
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:00,000
<8-5,BECKETT>你想不想休息一会儿  吃点早餐
<8-5,BECKETT>You want to take a break, maybe get some breakfast?

198
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,680
<8-6,CASTLE>不了  想出来再吃
<8-6,CASTLE>No, not until I figure this out.

199
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,490
<8-6,CASTLE>我去过那儿  凯特  我去过
<8-6,CASTLE>I was there, Kate. I was there.

200
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:06,860
<8-6,CASTLE>我中枪了  所以我才有枪疤
<8-6,CASTLE>I was shot at, which explains my bullet scar.

201
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,620
<8-6,CASTLE>我还得了登革热
<8-6,CASTLE>I was exposed to dengue fever,

202
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:11,130
<8-6,CASTLE>而那里正是这种病盛行的地方
<8-6,CASTLE>a disease that's prevalent in the region.

203
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:12,640
<8-6,CASTLE>所有事都对上了
<8-6,CASTLE>Everything fits.

204
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:17,840
<8-7,BECKETT>可是卡塞尔  你为什么会在婚礼当天被绑架
<8-7,BECKETT>But, Castle, why would you be abducted on our wedding day

205
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,590
<8-7,BECKETT>然后去了泰国呢
<8-7,BECKETT>and end up in Thailand?

206
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,420
<8-8,CASTLE>史上最差的单身派对了吧
<8-8,CASTLE>Worst bachelor party ever?

207
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,730
<8-9,BECKETT>或许博克医生说得对
<8-9,BECKETT>You know, maybe Dr. Burke is right.

208
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:26,710
<8-9,BECKETT>你在梦里见到的那些场景
<8-9,BECKETT>Maybe those images that you saw in your dream

209
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,140
<8-9,BECKETT>或许不是你真正的记忆
<8-9,BECKETT>are not really your memories.

210
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:30,630
<8-10,CASTLE>不  真的是我的记忆  真的
<8-10,CASTLE>Oh, no. They're memories. They're memories.

211
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,240
<8-10,CASTLE>而且你说了要跟着它们走
<8-10,CASTLE>And you said follow them wherever they go,

212
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,100
<8-10,CASTLE>这就是它所走的方向  泰国
<8-10,CASTLE>and this is where they go -- Thailand.

213
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,260
<8-10,CASTLE>这一切都跟泰国有关
<8-10,CASTLE>This is all about thailand.

214
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:40,920
<8-11,BECKETT>好吧  我们先不考虑泰国
<8-11,BECKETT>Okay, well, why don't we take a step back from Thailand.

215
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:42,980
<8-11,BECKETT>想想别的方面
<8-11,BECKETT>Why don't we take a look at some of the other images,

216
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:45,070
<8-11,BECKETT>比如  奖杯
<8-11,BECKETT>Like the -- the trophy.

217
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,630
<8-12,CASTLE>跟奖杯没关
<8-12,CASTLE>The trophy's irrelevant.

218
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,730
<8-13,BECKETT>它能出现在你的梦里就是有原因的
<8-13,BECKETT>Well, it was in your dream for a reason.

219
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,630
<8-13,BECKETT>你说好像在哪见过
<8-13,BECKETT>You said it was familiar in what way?

220
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,240
<8-13,BECKETT>是什么样的
<8-13,BECKETT>What did it look like?

221
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:54,850
<8-14,CASTLE>很便宜的那种  奖给小孩子的
<8-14,CASTLE>Cheap. You know, something that you would give a child.

222
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:59,190
<8-15,BECKETT>好的  会不会是阿丽克西斯得的什么奖
<8-15,BECKETT>Okay. So could it have been an award that Alexis won?

223
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,850
<8-15,BECKETT>又或许是你得的
<8-15,BECKETT>Maybe something that you won?

224
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,390
<8-15,BECKETT>写作得的奖
<8-15,BECKETT>Something for writing?

225
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,880
<8-16,CASTLE>我知道是什么了
<8-16,CASTLE>I know what it is.

226
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,960
<8-17,CASTLE>就是这个
<8-17,CASTLE>This is it.

227
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,280
<8-17,CASTLE>就是这个奖杯  这就是...
<8-17,CASTLE>This is the trophy. This is...

228
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:28,650
<8-17,CASTLE>我是在菲克罗夫特预科学校
<8-17,CASTLE>I, I won this in a -- in a debate competition

229
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:29,820
<8-17,CASTLE>参加辩论赛赢的
<8-17,CASTLE>back at Faircroft prep.

230
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,180
<8-18,BECKETT>为什么会出现在你的梦里呢
<8-18,BECKETT>Why would that be in your dream?

231
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,520
<8-19,CASTLE>不知道  不过
<8-19,CASTLE>I don't know, but...

232
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:37,180
<8-19,CASTLE>等等
<8-19,CASTLE>Wait a minute.

233
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:41,460
<8-20,BECKETT>菲利普·巴莱特
<8-20,BECKETT>Phillip Bartlett.

234
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:42,820
<8-20,BECKETT>菲利普·巴莱特是谁
<8-20,BECKETT>Who's Phillip Bartlett?

235
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:45,910
<8-21,CASTLE>菲利普·巴莱特和我  共同获得了第一
<8-21,CASTLE>Phillip Bartlett and I, we tied for first place.

236
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,650
<8-21,CASTLE>我们都得到了这个奖杯
<8-21,CASTLE>We shared this trophy.

237
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:49,020
<8-21,CASTLE>我梦里的那个人
<8-21,CASTLE>That man in my dream,

238
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,890
<8-21,CASTLE>跟我打招呼的那个人  就是他
<8-21,CASTLE>the one who says hello, it was him.

239
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:54,250
<8-21,CASTLE>他也到我这个年龄了  不过
<8-21,CASTLE>I mean, he's my age now, but...

240
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,740
<8-20,BECKETT>菲利普·巴莱特
<8-20,BECKETT>Phillip Bartlett.

241
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,940
<8-21,CASTLE>好久不见啊  里克
<8-21,CASTLE>Long time, Rick.

242
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,250
<8-21,CASTLE>他跟这事有关
<8-21,CASTLE>He's a part of this.

243
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,030
<8-22,CASTLE>我来找他
<8-22,CASTLE>If I'm gonna track him down,

244
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,160
<8-22,CASTLE>你去调查一下他的背景
<8-22,CASTLE>I'm gonna need you to do a background check on him.

245
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
<9-1,ESPOSITO>好吧  现在除了查克·诺里斯
<9-1,ESPOSITO>Okay, so now it's Chuck Norris

246
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,070
<9-1,ESPOSITO>又加上高中的老同学了吗
<9-1,ESPOSITO>and some old buddy from high school?

247
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,640
<9-2,BECKETT>拜托  我只是让你们去查一下菲利普·巴莱特
<9-2,BECKETT>Come on, guys. I'm just asking you to run Phillip Bartlett.

248
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:17,800
<9-2,BECKETT>卡塞尔一定要弄清楚是怎么回事
<9-2,BECKETT>Look, Castle needs to know what's going on.

249
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,050
<9-3,RYAN>如果什么都查不到呢
<9-3,RYAN>What if these leads go nowhere?

250
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,030
<9-4,BECKETT>那他也要知道结果
<9-4,BECKETT>Then he needs to know that, as well.

251
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:23,880
<9-5,BECKETT>抱歉  托瑞
<9-5,BECKETT>Excuse me. Tory!

252
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,580
<9-5,BECKETT>那个车牌还有什么新线索吗
<9-5,BECKETT>Hey, any more news on that license plate?

253
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,500
<9-6,TORY>一点点  注册那个车牌的公司
<9-6,TORY>A little -- the plate was registered

254
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:32,370
<9-6,TORY>是一家泰国的货运公司  1987年倒闭了
<9-6,TORY>to a Thai freight company that went out of business in 1987.

255
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:33,740
<9-7,BECKETT>1987年
<9-7,BECKETT>1987?

256
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,610
<9-7,BECKETT>卡塞尔怎么会在将近三十年后
<9-7,BECKETT>How would Castle see it on a truck

257
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:37,060
<9-7,BECKETT>看到挂这牌的车呢
<9-7,BECKETT>almost 30 years later?

258
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,270
<9-7,BECKETT>我不知道
<9-7,BECKETT>I don't know.

259
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:41,520
<9-8,TORY>有可能那个车牌被偷了  或者
<9-8,TORY>It's possible the plate was stolen, or...

260
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,600
<9-9,BECKETT>或者什么
<9-9,BECKETT>Or what?

261
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,440
<9-10,TORY>我对那个车牌进行了图像搜索
<9-10,TORY>I ran an image search of the plate.

262
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,320
<9-10,TORY>在很多动作电影的追车场景中
<9-10,TORY>Similar license plates appeared in several action films,

263
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,460
<9-10,TORY>都出现过这种相似的车牌
<9-10,TORY>during car-chase sequences.

264
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,370
<9-11,BECKETT>这么说你认为他是在电影里看见的
<9-11,BECKETT>So you think he might have seen it in a film.

265
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:55,610
<9-12,TORY>有可能
<9-12,TORY>Maybe.

266
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:01,100
<9-13,BECKETT>玛莎  怎么了
<9-13,BECKETT>Martha. Hey. What's -- what's going on?

267
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,450
<10-1,MARTHA>理查德简直走火入魔了
<10-1,MARTHA>Richard is completely obsessed,

268
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:09,210
<10-1,MARTHA>我很担心他
<10-1,MARTHA>and I am concerned about him.

269
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:10,350
<10-2,BECKETT>我知道  我也是
<10-2,BECKETT>I know. Me too.

270
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:13,850
<10-3,MARTHA>他从来没跟我说过失忆的事
<10-3,MARTHA>He never spoke to me about the missing time.

271
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,600
<10-3,MARTHA>我以为那事都过去了  你呢
<10-3,MARTHA>I thought he was at peace with it. Didn't you?

272
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,510
<10-4,BECKETT>我想是他的梦让他意识到
<10-4,BECKETT>Well, I guess the dreams made him realize

273
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:20,500
<10-4,BECKETT>那件事还没过去
<10-4,BECKETT>that he wasn't at peace.

274
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,640
<10-5,MARTHA>他想要忘记那两个月
<10-5,MARTHA>He chose to forget those two months.

275
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,480
<10-5,MARTHA>他做出这种选择  一定有个好理由
<10-5,MARTHA>He must have had a very good reason for wanting to do that.

276
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:29,610
<10-5,MARTHA>我觉得不应该继续追查这件事
<10-5,MARTHA>I think looking into this is a bad idea.

277
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:31,980
<10-6,BECKETT>玛莎  我觉得这由不得他
<10-6,BECKETT>Martha, I-I don't think that this is a choice for him.

278
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,350
<10-6,BECKETT>我想他必须要知道真相
<10-6,BECKETT>I think that he needs to know the truth.

279
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:36,340
<10-7,MARTHA>如果他找不出真相怎么办
<10-7,MARTHA>What if he never finds out the truth?

280
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:37,650
<10-7,MARTHA>如果他查不到什么怎么办
<10-7,MARTHA>What if he never learns anything?

281
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,650
<10-7,MARTHA>或者更糟糕的是  他查到了不好的事怎么办
<10-7,MARTHA>Or worse, what if he finds out something awful?

282
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,670
<10-8,BECKETT>我会陪着他的  无论怎样
<10-8,BECKETT>I'll be with him. Wherever this leads.

283
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:45,970
<10-8,BECKETT>而且我向你保证  我不会让他走太远
<10-8,BECKETT>And I promise you I am not gonna let him go too far.

284
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,240
<10-9,MARTHA>-谢谢你  -没事
<10-9,MARTHA>- Thank you. - Yeah.

285
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,780
<11-1,PHILLIP BARTLETT>好久不见啊  里克
<11-1,PHILLIP BARTLETT>Long time, Rick.

286
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,570
<11-1,PHILLIP BARTLETT>好久不见啊  里克
<11-1,PHILLIP BARTLETT>Long time, Rick.

287
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,370
<11-2,CASTLE>菲尔·巴莱特  谢谢你能来
<11-2,CASTLE>Phil Bartlett. Thank you for coming.

288
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:19,320
<11-3,BARTLETT>我知道你来找我
<11-3,BARTLETT>Well, I knew it was only a matter of time

289
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,670
<11-3,BARTLETT>是迟早的事
<11-3,BARTLETT>before I'd hear from you.

290
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:22,810
<11-4,CASTLE>你知道我会找你
<11-4,CASTLE>You were expecting my call?

291
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,920
<11-5,BARTLETT>当然了  而且我会帮你的
<11-5,BARTLETT>Of course I was. And I'm -- I'm here for you.

292
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:28,150
<11-6,CASTLE>谢天谢地  太好了
<11-6,CASTLE>Oh, thank God. What a relief. Okay.

293
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,740
<11-6,CASTLE>我要跟你谈谈泰国的事
<11-6,CASTLE>I need to talk to you about Thailand.

294
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:33,020
<11-7,BARTLETT>泰国的事你都知道些什么
<11-7,BARTLETT>What do you know about Thailand?

295
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:35,530
<11-8,CASTLE>我去过那儿  见过你
<11-8,CASTLE>I was there. I saw you.

296
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,160
<11-9,BARTLETT>你不应该知道的
<11-9,BARTLETT>You're not supposed to know.

297
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:41,630
<11-9,BARTLETT>谁都不应该知道  而且你不能告诉别人
<11-9,BARTLETT>Nobody is. And you can't tell anyone.

298
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,390
<11-10,CASTLE>我不会的  不会的  我保证
<11-10,CASTLE>I won't. I won't. I promise.

299
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:48,240
<11-10,CASTLE>不过你要告诉我你在那儿所看到的事
<11-10,CASTLE>As long as you tell me your version of what happened.

300
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,250
<11-11,BARLETT>我不能说
<11-11,BARLETT>I can't do that.

301
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,210
<11-12,CASTLE>我要知道你所知道的
<11-12,CASTLE>I need to know what you know.

302
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,560
<11-13,BARTLETT>我说的这些话绝对不能外传
<11-13,BARTLETT>What I'm about to say can never be repeated.

303
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,170
<11-14,CASTLE>明白
<11-14,CASTLE>Understood.

304
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:03,600
<11-15,BARTLETT>我去泰国是参加一个投资会议
<11-15,BARTLETT>I was in Thailand to attend an investment conference.

305
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:06,470
<11-15,BARTLETT>我们去了一家曼谷的夜店
<11-15,BARTLETT>We hit this Bangkok nightclub.

306
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,630
<11-15,BARTLETT>她太漂亮了
<11-15,BARTLETT>Oh, she was so beautiful.

307
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,470
<11-15,BARTLETT>我对天发誓  我以为她是个女的
<11-15,BARTLETT>I thought she was a woman. I swear to god.

308
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,890
<11-16,CASTLE>等等  什么
<11-16,CASTLE>Wait, what?

309
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:19,440
<11-16,CASTLE>不对  我让你说清迈的事
<11-16,CASTLE>No. I need you to tell me about Chiang Mai.

310
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,250
<11-17,BARTLETT>我没去过清迈
<11-17,BARTLETT>I was never in Chiang Mai.

311
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,130
<11-17,BARTLETT>我是在曼谷  你说你看见我了
<11-17,BARTLETT>I was in Bangkok. You said you saw me?

312
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:27,980
<11-18,CASTLE>是的  不过  我没看见你那个
<11-18,CASTLE>Yeah, but -- no, I-I didn't see that.

313
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,790
<11-19,BARTLETT>我想我们还是别再说这件事了
<11-19,BARTLETT>I think it's best that we never speak of this again.

314
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:35,170
<11-20,CASTLE>等等  你当时在那儿  我看见你了
<11-20,CASTLE>Wait, no. No. You were there. I know you were.

315
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:36,840
<11-21,BARTLETT>听着  我不知道你在玩什么把戏
<11-21,BARTLETT>Look, I don't know what kind of game you're playing here --

316
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,500
<11-22,CASTLE>这不是把戏
<11-22,CASTLE>It's not a game.

317
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,960
<11-22,CASTLE>我看到我们的奖杯  我们为辩论社赢来的
<11-22,CASTLE>I-I saw our trophy -- the one we won for debate club.

318
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,910
<11-22,CASTLE>你说你在等我找你
<11-22,CASTLE>You were expecting my call.

319
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,560
<11-22,CASTLE>你为什么认为我会找上你
<11-22,CASTLE>Why would you be expecting my call?

320
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:45,740
<11-22,CASTLE>菲利普·巴莱特
<11-22,CASTLE>Phillip Bartlett --

321
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:48,240
<11-23,BARTLETT>巴莱特-布拉多克财富管理公司
<11-23,BARTLETT>Bartlett-Braddock wealth management.

322
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,950
<11-23,BARTLETT>我想让你成为我的客户
<11-23,BARTLETT>I wanted to take you on as a client.

323
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,340
<11-23,BARTLETT>现在来看  还是算了吧
<11-23,BARTLETT>Now not so much.

324
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,350
<11-23,BARTLETT>你知道吗  我从来都不是什么辩论高手
<11-23,BARTLETT>You know, for the record, I was never a debate geek, all right?

325
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:54,840
<11-23,BARTLETT>我是打曲棍球的
<11-23,BARTLETT>I played lacrosse.

326
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,570
<12-1,CASTLE>这说不通
<12-1,CASTLE>It doesn't make any sense.

327
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:02,000
<12-1,CASTLE>他肯定与这有关  他在我梦里出现过
<12-1,CASTLE>He has to be part of this. He was in the dream.

328
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,850
<12-2,BECKETT>但我们已经查过他了
<12-2,BECKETT>Except we checked him out.

329
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:05,020
<12-2,BECKETT>第一次也是唯一一次
<12-2,BECKETT>The first and only time

330
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:07,490
<12-2,BECKETT>菲利普·巴莱特去泰国是一个月前
<12-2,BECKETT>Phillip Bartlett traveled to Thailand was a month ago,

331
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:09,890
<12-2,BECKETT>没有任何线索能把他和这件事联系起来
<12-2,BECKETT>and there's nothing that connects him to all of this.

332
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:11,690
<12-3,CASTLE>我甚至打给了菲克罗夫特预备学校
<12-3,CASTLE>I even called Faircroft Prep.

333
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:14,200
<12-3,CASTLE>他们确定菲利普·巴莱特没参加过辩论小组
<12-3,CASTLE>They confirmed Phillip Bartlett was not on the debate team.

334
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,670
<12-3,CASTLE>我也没有和人并列第一过
<12-3,CASTLE>I didn't share first place with anyone.

335
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:19,300
<12-4,BECKETT>宝贝  也许你太把你的梦当真了
<12-4,BECKETT>Uh, babe, maybe you're taking this whole dream thing too literally.

336
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,280
<12-4,BECKETT>或者也许是你把两段记忆结合在了一起
<12-4,BECKETT>Or maybe you've combined two memories together.

337
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,450
<12-5,CASTLE>不  我没有编故事
<12-5,CASTLE>No. I'm not making this up.

338
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,360
<12-5,CASTLE>但万一
<12-5,CASTLE>But what if...

339
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,810
<12-5,CASTLE>但万一这是《全面回忆》的状况呢
<12-5,CASTLE>What if this is "Total recall"?

340
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:31,710
<12-5,CASTLE>他们不仅仅消除了我的记忆
<12-5,CASTLE>Not only did they erase my memories,

341
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:35,290
<12-5,CASTLE>还用虚构的记忆把之前的替换掉了吗
<12-5,CASTLE>but they replaced them with false memories?

342
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:36,770
<12-5,CASTLE>但即使是虚构的记忆
<12-5,CASTLE>But the false memories

343
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:38,260
<12-5,CASTLE>也应该是基于现实的  对吗
<12-5,CASTLE>would have to be based in reality, right?

344
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,340
<12-5,CASTLE>否则  菲利普·巴莱特怎么会在其中呢
<12-5,CASTLE>Otherwise, why would Phillip Bartlett be in them?

345
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,240
<12-6,BECKETT>卡塞尔  听我说
<12-6,BECKETT>Uh, Castle, listen to me --

346
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,270
<12-7,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>贝克特探长  过来说句话
<12-7,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>Detective Beckett? A word?

347
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,190
<13-1,GATES>我注意到你动用了资源
<13-1,GATES>I've noticed you've devoted resources

348
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:52,600
<13-1,GATES>对菲利普·巴莱特进行了背景调查
<13-1,GATES>to running a background check on Phillip Bartlett.

349
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:55,220
<13-1,GATES>还追查了泰国的汽车牌照吗
<13-1,GATES>And tracing license plates in Thailand?

350
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,110
<13-2,BECKETT>长官  我在跟踪
<13-2,BECKETT>Uh, sir, I was following up

351
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:59,480
<13-2,BECKETT>一些关于卡塞尔失踪的新线索
<13-2,BECKETT>on some new leads about Castle's disappearance.

352
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,570
<13-3,GATES>和查克·诺里斯有关吗
<13-3,GATES>In connection to Chuck Norris?

353
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:04,160
<13-4,BECKETT>是的  有点复杂
<13-4,BECKETT>Yeah. It's complicated.

354
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,280
<13-5,GATES>凯特  我知道这对他来说很重要
<13-5,GATES>Kate, I know how important this is to him.

355
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,950
<13-5,GATES>但这些线索可靠吗
<13-5,GATES>But these leads, are they solid?

356
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:14,240
<13-5,GATES>或者只是卡塞尔先生想做最后的挣扎
<13-5,GATES>Or is Mr. Castle just grasping at straws?

357
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,350
<14-1,ESPOSITO>我调查了一下那个纹身
<14-1,ESPOSITO>I dug into that tattoo.

358
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,140
<14-2,CASTLE>那个标记代表着三角洲特种部队  对吗
<14-2,CASTLE>That insignia -- that means delta force, right?

359
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:33,170
<14-3,ESPOSITO>是的  这也是查克·诺里斯的电影名字
<14-3,ESPOSITO>Yeah. It's also the title of a Chuck Norris movie.

360
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:35,690
<14-4,CASTLE>三角洲那帮人不宣扬自己
<14-4,CASTLE>Well, delta guys don't advertise,

361
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:38,720
<14-5,ESPOSITO>所以  纹身的人现在肯定没有在服役
<14-5,ESPOSITO>so whoever's wearing that ink is no longer active duty.

362
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:40,750
<14-5,ESPOSITO>旗帜表明
<14-5,ESPOSITO>It says here on the banner

363
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,620
<14-5,ESPOSITO>他是第75游骑兵团
<14-5,ESPOSITO>that he's out of the 75th Ranger Regiment,

364
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:43,850
<14-5,ESPOSITO>三营B连的
<14-5,ESPOSITO>3rd Battalion, B company.

365
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:46,240
<14-5,ESPOSITO>我向五角大楼的兄弟确认了
<14-5,ESPOSITO>Now, I checked with my boy at the Pentagon,

366
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,910
<14-5,ESPOSITO>曾经服役过的人中只有很少一部分人
<14-5,ESPOSITO>and there's only a handful of guys with that service history

367
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:51,150
<14-5,ESPOSITO>和你说见过的人相匹配
<14-5,ESPOSITO>who match the guy you said you saw.

368
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:52,110
<14-5,ESPOSITO>给你
<14-5,ESPOSITO>Here you go.

369
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,470
<14-6,CASTLE>谢谢你  埃斯波西托  真是太好了
<14-6,CASTLE>Thank you for this, Esposito. This is great.

370
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,360
<14-6,CASTLE>他肯定会在里头
<14-6,CASTLE>So, he will be in here somewhere.

371
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:58,620
<14-7,ESPOSITO>但他没有
<14-7,ESPOSITO>Yeah, but he's not.

372
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:02,020
<14-8,ESPOSITO>这里没有一个人长得像查克·诺里斯
<14-8,ESPOSITO>None of those guys look like Chuck Norris.

373
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:05,050
<14-9,CASTLE>你不相信我  对吗
<14-9,CASTLE>You don't believe me, do you?

374
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:09,510
<14-10,ESPOSITO>在我看来  你失踪两个月里发生的故事
<14-10,ESPOSITO>For my money, your story about the missing two months

375
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,660
<14-10,ESPOSITO>一点都不符合常理
<14-10,ESPOSITO>never added up.

376
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,530
<14-10,ESPOSITO>现在看来也是
<14-10,ESPOSITO>It still doesn't.

377
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:23,580
<14-11,CASTLE>这就是那个人
<14-11,CASTLE>This is the guy.

378
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,830
<14-13,CASTLE>-算了  卡塞尔  -就是这个人
<14-13,CASTLE>- Come on, Castle. - No, this is the guy.

379
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:28,370
<14-14,ESPOSITO>这人一点都不像查克·诺里斯
<14-14,ESPOSITO>That guy looks nothing like Chuck Norris.

380
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:29,290
<14-15,CASTLE>有胡子的话就像了
<14-15,CASTLE>He would with a beard.

381
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,680
<14-15,CASTLE>而且他就生活在纽约市
<14-15,CASTLE>And he lives right here in the city.

382
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:35,380
<15-1,CASTLE>他叫杰夫·鲍尔斯  2009年光荣退伍
<15-1,CASTLE>His name is Jeff Powers -- honorable discharge in 2009,

383
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:38,380
<15-1,CASTLE>之后在伊拉克和阿富汗做承包商
<15-1,CASTLE>then he worked as a contractor in Iraq and Afghanistan.

384
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:39,510
<15-1,CASTLE>一看就是那种
<15-1,CASTLE>This is just the kind of guy

385
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:41,180
<15-1,CASTLE>会在泰国当雇佣兵的人
<15-1,CASTLE>who could be a mercenary in Thailand.

386
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:44,300
<15-1,CASTLE>他在那儿  贝克特  他知道发生了什么
<15-1,CASTLE>He was there, Beckett. He knows what happened.

387
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:46,360
<15-2,BECKETT>希望如此  但如果他不知道
<15-2,BECKETT>I hope so, but if he doesn't,

388
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,360
<15-2,BECKETT>我们就得先缓缓
<15-2,BECKETT>then we need to take a breath

389
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:49,150
<15-2,BECKETT>讨论怎么追查下去
<15-2,BECKETT>and discuss how to pursue this.

390
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:52,220
<15-2,BECKETT>或者是否要追查下去
<15-2,BECKETT>Or whether to pursue it.

391
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,060
<15-3,CASTLE>没有必要
<15-3,CASTLE>That won't be necessary.

392
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:55,030
<15-3,CASTLE>所有的答案都在这门后
<15-3,CASTLE>All the answers are right behind this door.

393
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,840
<15-4,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你在做什么
<15-4,BECKETT>Castle! What are you doing?

394
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:01,710
<15-5,CASTLE>没关系  他认识我
<15-5,CASTLE>It's okay. He knows me.

395
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:03,110
<15-5,CASTLE>杰夫·鲍尔斯
<15-5,CASTLE>Jeff Powers?

396
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:05,620
<15-5,CASTLE>是来自泰国的里克·卡塞尔
<15-5,CASTLE>It's Rick Castle from Thailand.

397
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:07,840
<15-5,CASTLE>你的门没锁
<15-5,CASTLE>Your door was unlocked.

398
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,790
<15-5,CASTLE>只是想问你几个问题
<15-5,CASTLE>Just wanted to ask you a few questions.

399
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:10,880
<15-6,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<15-6,BECKETT>Castle.

400
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,700
<15-6,BECKETT>就是他
<15-6,BECKETT>That's him.

401
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:25,480
<15-7,CASTLE>那是在我梦里的出现的人
<15-7,CASTLE>That's the guy in my dream.

402
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,150
<16-1,LANIE PARISH>好吧  不用说
<16-1,LANIE PARISH>Well, needless to say,

403
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:33,170
<16-1,LANIE PARISH>头上的枪伤很可能就是死因
<16-1,LANIE PARISH>that G.S.W. to the head is the likely cause of death.

404
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:34,020
<16-2,BECKETT>什么时候发生的
<16-2,BECKETT>When did this happen?

405
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:36,570
<16-3,LANIE>根据肝脏温度来看  大约在昨晚午夜
<16-3,LANIE>Based on liver temp, about midnight last night.

406
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:39,280
<16-3,LANIE>但全面的尸检后  我会知道更多信息
<16-3,LANIE>But I'll know more once I do a full work-up on him.

407
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:41,710
<16-4,LANIE>卡塞尔开始想起了这个人
<16-4,LANIE>Castle starts remembering this guy.

408
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:44,490
<16-4,LANIE>突然之间  他就被人杀了
<16-4,LANIE>And all of a sudden, he becomes a homicide victim?

409
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,580
<16-4,LANIE>有点奇怪
<16-4,LANIE>That's kind of weird.

410
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:48,520
<16-5,BECKETT>是的  不仅仅是奇怪  这很可疑
<16-5,BECKETT>Yeah. It's not just weird. It's suspicious.

411
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,480
<16-6,RYAN>我希望卡塞尔的故事是真的
<16-6,RYAN>Well, I was hoping to prove Castle's story was true,

412
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,750
<16-6,RYAN>但并不是像这样
<16-6,RYAN>but not like this.

413
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,950
<16-7,BECKET>是啊  联系一下他的亲属
<16-7,BECKET>Yeah. Contact the next-of-kin.

414
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:57,960
<16-7,BECKET>让我们查明杰夫·鲍尔斯卷入了什么
<16-7,BECKET>Let's find out what Jeff Powers was into.

415
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,260
<16-8,RYAN>说来容易做起来难
<16-8,RYAN>Easier said than done.

416
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:01,350
<16-8,RYAN>他的父母双亡  没有妻子和兄弟姐妹
<16-8,RYAN>His parents are dead, no wife or siblings.

417
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:04,290
<16-8,RYAN>希望能找到某个他的朋友或者战友
<16-8,RYAN>Hoping to track down a friend or someone he served with.

418
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,710
<16-8,RYAN>我已经在查了
<16-8,RYAN>But I'm on it.

419
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:13,620
<17-1,BECKETT>你怎么样
<17-1,BECKETT>Hey. How you doing?

420
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,100
<17-2,CASTLE>乐观地说  至少我没有疯
<17-2,CASTLE>On the bright side, at least I'm not crazy.

421
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:18,660
<17-3,BECKETT>我从没认为你发疯了
<17-3,BECKETT>Yeah, well, I never thought you were.

422
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,130
<17-4,CASTLE>我曾一度认为我疯了
<17-4,CASTLE>Well, I sure thought I was.

423
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:22,330
<17-4,CASTLE>你肯定也有怀疑过
<17-4,CASTLE>You must have had a few moments of doubt.

424
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,320
<17-4,CASTLE>我们知道是谁杀了他吗
<17-4,CASTLE>Do we have any idea who killed him?

425
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:25,520
<17-5,BECKETT>现在还为时过早
<17-5,BECKETT>It's too soon to tell.

426
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:27,660
<17-5,BECKETT>但我们会追查到底的
<17-5,BECKETT>But we're gonna get to the bottom of this.

427
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:30,190
<17-6,CASTLE>万一这是我的过错怎么办
<17-6,CASTLE>What if it's my fault?

428
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:33,430
<17-6,CASTLE>万一是我的调查害他被杀了怎么办
<17-6,CASTLE>What if me poking around is what got him killed?

429
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:35,130
<17-7,BECKETT>卡塞尔  怎么可能呢
<17-7,BECKETT>Castle, how could that even be possible?

430
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:36,930
<17-8,CASTLE>我不知道  也许我被人跟踪或监视了
<17-8,CASTLE>I don't know. Maybe I'm being followed or watched.

431
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:38,540
<17-8,CASTLE>他的死肯定不是巧合
<17-8,CASTLE>His death cannot be a coincidence.

432
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:40,840
<17-9,BECKETT>看上去也不像  是吗
<17-9,BECKETT>Yeah. It doesn't seem like one, does it?

433
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,810
<17-10,CASTLE>20分钟后我可能会知道得更多
<17-10,CASTLE>Well, I may know more in 20 minutes.

434
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,060
<17-11,BECKETT>你是说你和博克医生的预约吗
<17-11,BECKETT>You mean your appointment with Dr. Burke?

435
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,770
<17-12,CASTLE>是的  如果我能记起在泰国的事情
<17-12,CASTLE>Yeah, if I can remember about Thailand,

436
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:49,260
<17-12,CASTLE>也许能帮我们解决这个案子
<17-12,CASTLE>it may help us solve this murder.

437
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:52,670
<17-14,BECKETT>好的  和我保持联系
<17-14,BECKETT>Okay. Keep me close.

438
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:53,510
<17-15,CASTLE>会的
<17-15,CASTLE>Always.

439
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:55,780
<17-16,RYAN>贝克特
<17-16,RYAN>Hey, uh, Beckett?

440
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:57,940
<17-17,BECKETT>请务必告诉我有线索了
<17-17,BECKETT>Hey. Please tell me we got something.

441
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,180
<17-18,RYAN>我找到了这个
<17-18,RYAN>Well, I did find this --

442
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:01,660
<17-18,RYAN>一张活色生香的鸡尾酒餐巾纸
<17-18,RYAN>a cocktail napkin from Exotica.

443
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,080
<17-19,BECKETT>是个脱衣舞俱乐部吗
<17-19,BECKETT>I take it that's a strip club?

444
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,000
<17-20,RYAN>是的  这个在被害人的口袋里
<17-20,RYAN>Yeah. And this was in the victim's pocket.

445
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,500
<17-20,RYAN>昨晚回到家遇害之前
<17-20,RYAN>It could be where he was last night

446
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,310
<17-20,RYAN>他有可能就在那
<17-20,RYAN>before he came home and wound up dead.

447
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,780
<17-21,BECKETT>有可能他在那遇到了凶手
<17-21,BECKETT>And it might be where he met our killer.

448
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,570
<17-22,RYAN>我看看是否能找到这个俱乐部
<17-22,RYAN>I'll see if I can find out who he spent time with

449
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:14,080
<17-22,RYAN>和他在一起的人
<17-22,RYAN>at, uh, exotica.

450
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:17,250
<18-1,AMBER>我当然认识杰夫  他是常客
<18-1,AMBER>Sure, I know Jeff. He's a regular.

451
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:19,050
<18-1,AMBER>他一周会来几次
<18-1,AMBER>He's at the club a few nights a week.

452
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:21,890
<18-1,AMBER>他很好  一直都很绅士
<18-1,AMBER>He's nice, always a gentleman.

453
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:25,000
<18-2,ESPOSITO>他昨晚在那  是吗
<18-2,ESPOSITO>Fact is, he was there last night, right?

454
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:26,930
<18-2,ESPOSITO>他当时和别人在一起吗
<18-2,ESPOSITO>Was he there with somebody?

455
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:28,060
<18-3,AMBER>只有我
<18-3,AMBER>Just me.

456
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,880
<18-4,RYAN>安珀  你注意到他和其他人说过话
<18-4,RYAN>Amber, did you notice if he talked to anyone,

457
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,380
<18-4,RYAN>或者和别人一起走了吗
<18-4,RYAN>or left with anyone?

458
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:34,920
<18-5,AMBER>杰夫不是对社交感兴趣的人
<18-5,AMBER>Jeff wasn't much for socializing.

459
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,340
<18-6,ESPOSITO>他有没有你知道的朋友
<18-6,ESPOSITO>Did he have any friends that you know of?

460
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,800
<18-6,ESPOSITO>去俱乐部找过他的人
<18-6,ESPOSITO>Anybody ever stop by the club?

461
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,170
<18-7,AMBER>有一个朋友
<18-7,AMBER>Yeah. One friend did.

462
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,480
<18-8,RYAN>-谁  -军队里的人
<18-8,RYAN>- Who? - Some army buddy.

463
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,140
<18-9,AMBER>他来找杰夫
<18-9,AMBER>He came in looking for Jeff.

464
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:49,370
<18-9,AMBER>他来城里  想要给他个惊喜
<18-9,AMBER>He was in town, visiting, and wanted to surprise him,

465
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:51,560
<18-9,AMBER>所以让我不要说出去
<18-9,AMBER>So he made me swear not to say anything.

466
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,520
<18-10,ESPOSITO>什么时候的事
<18-10,ESPOSITO>When was this?

467
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:54,650
<18-11,AMBER>三天前吧
<18-11,AMBER>Three days ago, maybe?

468
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,260
<18-12,RYAN>安珀  这个杰夫的战友
<18-12,RYAN>Amber, this army buddy of Jeff's --

469
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,820
<18-12,RYAN>你对他的印象清晰吗  能帮我们
<18-12,RYAN>Do you think you remember this guy well enough

470
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,140
<18-12,RYAN>做张素描吗
<18-12,RYAN>to help us out with a sketch?

471
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:01,520
<18-12,RYAN>可以吧
<18-12,RYAN>Sure.

472
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:04,870
<18-13,AMBER>为什么  杰夫出事了吗
<18-13,AMBER>Why? Is something going on with Jeff?

473
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:10,070
<19-1,CASTLE>没有用
<19-1,CASTLE>It's not working.

474
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:14,110
<19-1,CASTLE>我想不起什么新线索了
<19-1,CASTLE>I-I-I can't remember anything new.

475
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:15,910
<19-1,CASTLE>只能想起之前的图像
<19-1,CASTLE>I keep coming up with the same images.

476
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,380
<19-2,BURKE>我们换个方式思考吧
<19-2,BURKE>Let's look at this another way.

477
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:20,260
<19-2,BURKE>也许你想起了那些图像是有原因的
<19-2,BURKE>Perhaps the images came to you for a reason.

478
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,500
<19-3,CASTLE>-有什么事触发了记忆  -什么事呢
<19-3,CASTLE>- Something trigred them. - Like what?

479
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:25,120
<19-4,BURKE>你一周前开始做这梦
<19-4,BURKE>You began having this dream over a week ago.

480
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,840
<19-4,BURKE>一周前发生了什么不寻常的事吗
<19-4,BURKE>Did anything unusual occur on that particular day?

481
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:32,780
<19-5,CASTLE>没啊  我起床  和贝克特吃了早餐
<19-5,CASTLE>No. I got up. I had breakfast with Beckett.

482
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,410
<19-5,CASTLE>她要去法院所以我去了健身房
<19-5,CASTLE>She had to go to court. Uh, I went to the gym.

483
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:37,340
<19-6,BURKE>之后呢
<19-6,BURKE>And then?

484
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,820
<19-7,CASTLE>写了会儿小说
<19-7,CASTLE>I wrote for a while.

485
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,540
<19-7,CASTLE>我想换个环境
<19-7,CASTLE>I wanted a change of scenery,

486
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:44,610
<19-7,CASTLE>所以带着笔记本电脑去了咖啡店
<19-7,CASTLE>so I took my laptop to the coffee shop...

487
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,910
<19-8,BURKE>你想起什么了
<19-8,BURKE>There. What did you just remember?

488
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:49,360
<19-9,CASTLE>只是在咖啡店时
<19-9,CASTLE>Just that when I was at the coffee shop,

489
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,060
<19-9,CASTLE>突然听到种奇怪的
<19-9,CASTLE>I-I got this strange, um,

490
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:54,370
<19-9,CASTLE>像是耳鸣似的嗡响
<19-9,CASTLE>like a buzzing, ringing in my ears.

491
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,080
<19-10,BURKE>回想一周前你在咖啡店的经历
<19-10,BURKE>Let's go back a week ago to the coffee shop.

492
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,870
<19-10,BURKE>这种嗡响出现时你在干什么
<19-10,BURKE>What were you doing when this buzzing first started?

493
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:01,990
<19-11,CASTLE>写小说
<19-11,CASTLE>I was writing.

494
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:05,190
<19-11,CASTLE>或者说  卡住了写不出来
<19-11,CASTLE>Or, rather, procrastinating.

495
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:09,670
<19-11,CASTLE>我卡在一个场景上  于是开始观察周围的人
<19-11,CASTLE>I was stuck on a scene, so I was just people-watching.

496
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:11,030
<19-12,BURKE>看到认识的人了吗
<19-12,BURKE>Anyone you knew?

497
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:12,970
<19-12,BURKE>或者认出了谁
<19-12,BURKE>Or recognized?

498
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:16,260
<19-12,BURKE>没有
<19-12,BURKE>No.

499
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:17,770
<19-13,CASTLE>我想不是
<19-13,CASTLE>No, I don't think so.

500
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:20,860
<19-13,CASTLE>等等  那声音
<19-13,CASTLE>Wait a minute. That ringing --

501
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,990
<19-13,CASTLE>是在我看到电视时响起的
<19-13,CASTLE>It started when I looked up at the TV.

502
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,770
<19-14,BURKE>当时是什么节目
<19-14,BURKE>What was playing?

503
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,320
<19-15,CASTLE>当地新闻
<19-15,CASTLE>Something from the local news.

504
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,800
<19-15,CASTLE>还有两天就是4.15了
<19-15,CASTLE>April 15th is only two days away.

505
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:34,630
<20-1,TORY>你当时看见的应该是这段
<20-1,TORY>This is the clip you would have seen.

506
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:35,370
<20-1,TORY>好的一面是
<20-1,TORY>But, on the bright side,

507
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:37,710
<20-2,NEWSCASTER>邮局将延迟关门
<20-2,NEWSCASTER>Many post offices will be open extra late

508
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:40,500
<20-2,NEWSCASTER>为了那些临时申报者能及时上交纳税申报单
<20-2,NEWSCASTER>To accept tax returns from last-minute filers.

509
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,350
<20-3,CASTLE>不过是条纳税申报的新闻
<20-3,CASTLE>It's just some report on tax day.

510
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:44,310
<20-3,CASTLE>也许嗡鸣声和这无关
<20-3,CASTLE>Maybe the buzzing has nothing to do with this.

511
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:44,990
<20-4,BECKETT>再看一下吧
<20-4,BECKETT>Just keep watching.

512
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:45,920
<20-4,BECKETT>也许还有别的什么
<20-4,BECKETT>There's got to be something else there.

513
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,370
<20-1,TORY>联邦大厦  教堂街
<20-1,TORY>The federal plaza, church street,

514
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:50,420
<20-2,NEWSCASTER>还有唐人街的邮局都将延长服务时间
<20-2,NEWSCASTER>and chinatown post offices will all have extended hours

515
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:52,010
<20-3,CASTLE>等等  暂停一下  暂停
<20-3,CASTLE>Wait. Um, pause it. Pause it.

516
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:53,010
<20-5,CASTLE>当然了  税务局
<20-5,CASTLE>Of course, the I.R.S. --

517
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:58,790
<20-6,BECKETT>怎么了
<20-6,BECKETT>What is it?

518
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,920
<20-7,CASTLE>托瑞  放大一下那个人
<20-7,CASTLE>Tory, zoom in on that man right there.

519
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:08,440
<20-7,CASTLE>我见过他
<20-7,CASTLE>I know him.

520
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,640
<20-7,CASTLE>他就是坐车追我们的其中一个人
<20-7,CASTLE>He was the one chasing us in the truck.

521
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:14,680
<20-9,CASTLE>-你确定吗  -我确定  他也在泰国
<20-9,CASTLE>- Are you sure? - Yes, I'm sure. He was in Thailand.

522
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:18,010
<20-10,ESPOSITO>拿到去脱衣舞俱乐部
<20-10,ESPOSITO>We got our sketch back of the guy who showed up

523
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:20,440
<20-10,ESPOSITO>找杰夫·鲍尔斯那人的画像了
<20-10,ESPOSITO>at the strip club, asking for Jeff Powers.

524
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:25,850
<20-11,CASTLE>同一个人
<20-11,CASTLE>The same man.

525
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:29,100
<20-11,CASTLE>先是在泰国  现在又在纽约
<20-11,CASTLE>First in Thailand, now in New York.

526
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,320
<20-11,CASTLE>不管他是谁  这事肯定与他有关
<20-11,CASTLE>Whoever he is, he's at the center of this.

527
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:36,390
<21-1,CASTLE>我想起来了这些
<21-1,CASTLE>Catching a glimpse of his face

528
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:37,840
<21-1,CASTLE>都是因为看到了他
<21-1,CASTLE>is what started all this.

529
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:40,190
<21-1,CASTLE>是他触发了我的那些梦  但他是谁呢
<21-1,CASTLE>It's what triggered my dreams. But who is he?

530
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:41,890
<21-2,BECKETT>关于他你还记得什么别的吗
<21-2,BECKETT>What else do you remember about him?

531
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:43,570
<21-3,CASTLE>他当时穿得像个大兵
<21-3,CASTLE>Uh, he was dressed like a soldier.

532
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:44,980
<21-4,BECKETT>你说他在向手下吼着什么
<21-4,BECKETT>You said he was yelling at his men?

533
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,450
<21-4,BECKETT>用的什么语言
<21-4,BECKETT>In what language?

534
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:49,170
<21-4,BECKETT>快点  开快点
<21-4,BECKETT>Faster! Faster!

535
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:50,860
<21-5,CASTLE>他说英语
<21-5,CASTLE>He was speaking English.

536
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:53,220
<21-6,RYAN>他是美国人吗  还是英国人
<21-6,RYAN>So, was he American? British?

537
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:55,310
<21-7,CASTLE>不  我觉得他带点口音
<21-7,CASTLE>No. I-I think he had an accent.

538
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:56,560
<21-8,ESPOSITO>那可能是欧洲人了
<21-8,ESPOSITO>So European, maybe.

539
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,210
<21-8,ESPOSITO>我去国际刑事警察组织检索他的照片
<21-8,ESPOSITO>I'll run his photo through interpol, see if they know him.

540
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:00,720
<21-9,RYAN>我会派警员去排查视频是在哪拍摄的
<21-9,RYAN>And I'll have unis canvass where that video was taken

541
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,470
<21-9,RYAN>看看周围有没有人见过他
<21-9,RYAN>and see if anyone in that neighborhood recognizes him.

542
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:05,210
<21-11,CASTLE>谢了两位  我们还能做什么
<21-11,CASTLE>Thanks, guys. Okay, what else can we do?

543
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:08,580
<21-12,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你不能继续参与了
<21-12,BECKETT>Castle, you can't be a part of this. Not anymore.

544
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:09,570
<21-13,CASTLE>你说什么呀  我必须参与
<21-13,CASTLE>What do you mean? I have to be.

545
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:10,940
<21-14,BECKETT>我们并不知道这个人要干什么
<21-14,BECKETT>We don't know this man's agenda.

546
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,260
<21-15,CASTLE>不  贝克特  我需要
<21-15,CASTLE>No, no, Beckett. I need to be --

547
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,120
<21-16,BECKETT>你需要回家
<21-16,BECKETT>What you need to do is go back to the loft

548
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,220
<21-16,BECKETT>好好待着
<21-16,BECKETT>and stay there.

549
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:17,240
<21-16,BECKETT>我已经派了警员保护你
<21-16,BECKETT>Now, I've assigned a security detail to you.

550
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,180
<21-17,CASTLE>我为什么会是目标
<21-17,CASTLE>Why would I be a target?

551
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:19,650
<21-18,BECKETT>我不知道  你也不知道
<21-18,BECKETT>I don't know. And neither do you.

552
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:21,450
<21-18,BECKETT>但在泰国时他就想杀你
<21-18,BECKETT>But he was shooting at you in Thailand.

553
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:22,980
<21-18,BECKETT>而他刚刚杀了杰夫·鲍尔斯
<21-18,BECKETT>And he just killed Jeff Powers,

554
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,660
<21-19,CASTLE>你所谓的查克·诺里斯
<21-19,CASTLE>your Chuck Norris look-alike.

555
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:27,440
<21-20,BECKETT>警员会送你回家
<21-20,BECKETT>Now, L.T. is gonna drive you home.

556
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,100
<21-19,CASTLE>我要是拒绝呢
<21-19,CASTLE>And if I refuse?

557
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,240
<21-20,BECKETT>那就铐起来然后送你回家
<21-20,BECKETT>Then he'll drive you home in handcuffs.

558
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:34,640
<21-21,CASTLE>我要说清楚  我郁闷
<21-21,CASTLE>Just for the record? Extremely bitter.

559
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:37,530
<21-22,BECKETT>我们找到了什么会告诉你的
<21-22,BECKETT>I'll call you if we find anything.

561
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,950
<22-1,BECKETT>蕾妮  你有什么发现
<22-1,BECKETT>Lanie, hey. What did you find?

562
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:47,850
<22-2,LANIE>首先  鲍尔斯先生的血检结果出来了
<22-2,LANIE>Well, for one thing, Mr. Powers' blood work came back.

563
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:50,220
<22-2,LANIE>他体内也有登革热抗体
<22-2,LANIE>He had antibodies for dengue fever.

564
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,770
<22-3,RYAN>跟卡塞尔一样
<22-3,RYAN>Just like Castle.

565
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:53,470
<22-4,LANIE>菌株很相似
<22-4,LANIE>Similar strain, too.

566
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:56,550
<22-4,LANIE>但最重要的发现是在他嘴里
<22-4,LANIE>But the main attraction is what I found in the man's mouth.

567
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,940
<22-5,RYAN>或者说  最重要的缺失
<22-5,RYAN>Huh. Rather, what you didn't find.

568
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,380
<22-6,BECKETT>他的牙怎么了
<22-6,BECKETT>What happened to his teeth?

569
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:05,530
<22-7,LANIE>被拔掉了  八颗
<22-7,LANIE>They were pried out -- eight of them --

570
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:06,920
<22-7,LANIE>发生在他死前不久
<22-7,LANIE>Shortly before he died.

571
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,640
<22-8,RYAN>鲍尔斯死前被拷问过  是复仇吗
<22-8,RYAN>So Powers was tortured first. Revenge?

572
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:12,600
<22-9,BECKETT>或者是凶手想知道什么信息
<22-9,BECKETT>Or the killer wanted information.

573
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,410
<22-9,BECKETT>留下了什么线索吗
<22-9,BECKETT>Did he leave any evidence behind?

574
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:15,590
<22-10,LANIE>恐怕没有
<22-10,LANIE>I'm afraid not.

575
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,370
<22-10,LANIE>他应该是戴着医用手套
<22-10,LANIE>Looks like he wore latex gloves.

576
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:19,860
<22-10,LANIE>我在被害人的口腔里发现了滑石粉的痕迹
<22-10,LANIE>I found traces of talc in the victim's mouth.

577
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:22,980
<22-11,BECKETT>那手套上一定有血迹
<22-11,BECKETT>The gloves would have been bloody.

578
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,290
<22-11,BECKETT>凶手肯定得扔掉它们
<22-11,BECKETT>The killer would have to get rid of them.

579
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:26,200
<22-11,BECKETT>上面也许就有凶手的指纹或者DNA
<22-11,BECKETT>They could have his prints or DNA on them.

580
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,550
<22-12,RYAN>没错  但手套根本无从找起
<22-12,RYAN>Right, but those gloves could be anywhere.

581
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:28,550
<22-12,RYAN>我们怎么找呢
<22-12,RYAN>How would we find them?

582
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:30,720
<22-13,BECKETT>局里有警犬
<22-13,BECKETT>The department has bloodhounds.

583
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:34,460
<22-13,BECKETT>联系警犬小队  让他们带上警犬
<22-13,BECKETT>Call the K-9 unit, have them deploy bloodhounds

584
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,380
<22-13,BECKETT>搜查鲍尔斯的公寓周边
<22-13,BECKETT>to search near Powers' apartment building.

585
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:42,600
<23-1,RYAN>谢谢
<23-1,RYAN>Thanks.

586
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,310
<23-2,ESPOSITO>找到手套了吗
<23-2,ESPOSITO>Find the gloves yet?

587
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,550
<23-3,RYAN>目前还一无所获
<23-3,RYAN>Oh, nothing so far.

588
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:48,290
<23-4,ESPOSITO>我这边也是
<23-4,ESPOSITO>Yeah, not with my team either.

589
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:49,750
<23-5,RYAN>也许警犬能有什么发现呢
<23-5,RYAN>Well, the dogs may still come through.

590
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:50,750
<23-6,ESPOSITO>我觉得可能性不大
<23-6,ESPOSITO>I'm not so sure.

591
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,380
<23-6,ESPOSITO>说不定
<23-6,ESPOSITO>For all we know,

592
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:52,670
<23-6,ESPOSITO>凶手根本就没有丢掉手套
<23-6,ESPOSITO>the killer didn't even toss his gloves.

593
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:55,350
<23-7,RYAN>怎么  就带着血迹斑斑的手套上街吗
<23-7,RYAN>So what? He's just walking around with bloody latex?

594
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,060
<23-8,ESPOSITO>不  他可以装在密封袋里带走
<23-8,ESPOSITO>Nah. He could have put them in a ziploc bag,

595
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:58,140
<23-8,ESPOSITO>或者是烧掉
<23-8,ESPOSITO>could have burned them.

596
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:01,310
<23-9,RYAN>重点在于  就算真找到了手套
<23-9,RYAN>Yeah, the thing of it is, even if we find the gloves

597
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:04,240
<23-9,RYAN>取得了凶手的指纹DNA  确认了身份
<23-9,RYAN>and get the killer's prints or dna and we do I.D. this guy,

598
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:05,770
<23-9,RYAN>他恐怕也早逃之夭夭了
<23-9,RYAN>he's probably long gone by now.

599
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:08,390
<23-11,RYAN>-为什么  -如果他想要的是信息
<23-11,RYAN>- Based on what? - Well, if he wanted information,

600
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:10,120
<23-11,RYAN>很可能已经在对杰夫·鲍尔斯的
<23-11,RYAN>he probably got it from Jeff Powers,

601
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,410
<23-11,RYAN>拷问中得到了
<23-11,RYAN>yanking out all of his teeth.

602
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:14,130
<23-12,ESPOSITO>不  鲍尔斯这样训练有素的士兵
<23-12,ESPOSITO>No. A soldier like Powers? His training?

603
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:16,420
<23-12,ESPOSITO>他是死也不会招的
<23-12,ESPOSITO>No, he'd die before he spilled his guts.

604
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,910
<23-13,RYAN>我希望你说错了
<23-13,RYAN>I hope you're wrong about that.

605
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:20,200
<23-13,RYAN>因为如果凶手要的是信息
<23-13,RYAN>'cause if our killer was after information,

606
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:22,830
<23-13,RYAN>他可能会认为卡塞尔知道
<23-13,RYAN>he may think Castle has it.

607
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:35,950
<24-1,CASTLE>你不是说今晚要在朋友家住吗
<24-1,CASTLE>Hey. I thought you said you were staying at a friend's tonight.

608
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,100
<24-2,ALEXIS>不  是你说要我去朋友家住的
<24-2,ALEXIS>No. Uh, you said I was staying at a friend's.

609
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:41,270
<24-3,CASTLE>是吗  那你怎么不听话呢
<24-3,CASTLE>Oh. Well, then, you should have listened.

610
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:42,680
<24-4,ALEXIS>我想陪着你
<24-4,ALEXIS>I wanted to be here with you.

611
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,650
<24-4,ALEXIS>我知道这案子对你意义重大
<24-4,ALEXIS>I know this isn't just another case.

612
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,790
<24-5,CASTLE>那个  昨天在我办公室
<24-5,CASTLE>Oh, yeah. Listen -- yesterday morning in my office.

613
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:55,320
<24-5,CASTLE>我简直跟《回到未来》的布朗博士似的
<24-5,CASTLE>I know I was a little Doc Brown, "Back to the future."

614
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:00,660
<24-6,ALEXIS>在泰国到底发生了什么事  爸爸
<24-6,ALEXIS>What really went on in Thailand, dad?

615
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,960
<24-6,ALEXIS>我知道你肯定有猜测了
<24-6,ALEXIS>I know you must have a theory.

616
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,070
<24-7,CASTLE>那还用说  有一大堆
<24-7,CASTLE>Uh, believe me, I have dozens.

617
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,780
<24-8,ALEXIS>哪个最吓人
<24-8,ALEXIS>Which one scares you the most?

618
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,600
<24-8,ALEXIS>我不需要你保护我
<24-8,ALEXIS>I don't need you to protect me.

619
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,010
<24-8,ALEXIS>我不再是个小孩子了
<24-8,ALEXIS>I'm not a kid anymore.

620
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,020
<24-8,ALEXIS>我也不害怕听到真相了
<24-8,ALEXIS>I'm not afraid to hear the truth.

621
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:18,040
<24-9,CASTLE>没错  你不怕了  对吧
<24-9,CASTLE>That's right. You aren't, are you?

622
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:20,170
<24-10,ALEXIS>为什么不让我参与进来
<24-10,ALEXIS>Why not let me in?

623
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:26,720
<24-11,CASTLE>我想忘记一切
<24-11,CASTLE>I wanted to forget everything.

624
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:31,350
<24-11,CASTLE>在最黑暗的时刻  我一直在想...
<24-11,CASTLE>So in my darkest moments, I wonder if I...

625
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,770
<24-11,CASTLE>我是不是做了什么糟糕的事情
<24-11,CASTLE>Did something terrible.

626
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36,060
<24-11,CASTLE>我了解你
<24-11,CASTLE>I know you.

627
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:38,070
<24-12,ALEXIS>你永远不会做坏事的
<24-12,ALEXIS>You would never do anything bad.

628
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:42,610
<24-13,CASTLE>我永远不会离开我的挚爱
<24-13,CASTLE>I could never leave the love of my life,

629
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:45,070
<24-13,CASTLE>抛下她和你整整两个月
<24-13,CASTLE>desert her and you for two months.

630
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,420
<24-13,CASTLE>可不知怎的我还是做了
<24-13,CASTLE>And somehow I did.

631
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:53,840
<24-13,CASTLE>卡塞尔
<24-13,CASTLE>Castle.

632
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:56,210
<25-1,CASTLE>我们怎么找到这家伙的
<25-1,CASTLE>How did we I.D. this guy?

633
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,160
<25-2,RYAN>是一条名叫库丘的警犬找到的
<25-2,RYAN>By way of a bloodhound named Cujo.

634
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,810
<25-3,ESPOSITO>库丘在一个离案发现场四个街区远的
<25-3,ESPOSITO>Cujo sniffed out a paper bag in a storm drain

635
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:02,640
<25-3,ESPOSITO>下水道里发现了一个纸袋
<25-3,ESPOSITO>about four blocks away from the crime scene.

636
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:04,270
<25-3,ESPOSITO>袋子里有乳胶手套
<25-3,ESPOSITO>The bag contained latex gloves.

637
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:05,900
<25-4,CASTLE>我们能确认这幅手套是凶手的
<25-4,CASTLE>And we're sure these gloves belong to the killer?

638
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:08,170
<25-5,RYAN>是的  袋子里还有牙齿
<25-5,RYAN>Yeah. The bag had teeth in it, too.

639
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:10,640
<25-5,RYAN>无论如何  鉴证科都找到了指纹
<25-5,RYAN>In any case, CSU was able to pull prints.

640
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:13,580
<25-6,ESPOSITO>我们在ECRIS找到匹配  那是欧洲指纹网络
<25-6,ESPOSITO>We got a hit off ECRIS, European fingerprint network.

641
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,160
<25-7,CASTLE>那凶手是欧洲人
<25-7,CASTLE>So the killer's European?

642
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:18,210
<25-8,BECKETT>他是俄国人  叫伊利亚·戈洛夫金
<25-8,BECKETT>He's Russian. Ilya Golovkin.

643
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,140
<25-8,BECKETT>凯赛尔  这个名字听着耳熟吗
<25-8,BECKETT>Castle, does that name sound familiar?

644
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:21,310
<25-9,CASTLE>不  他是谁
<25-9,CASTLE>No. Who is he?

645
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:22,600
<25-10,ESPOSITO>他曾在雪域特战队服役过...
<25-10,ESPOSITO>He served in Spetsnaz --

646
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,030
<25-10,ESPOSITO>俄国的特种部队...
<25-10,ESPOSITO>Russian special forces --

647
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:25,600
<25-10,ESPOSITO>然后加入了克格勃
<25-10,ESPOSITO>then moved on to the former KGB.

648
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,970
<25-11,CASTLE>俄国人是幕后黑手
<25-11,CASTLE>The Russians are behind this?

649
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:27,480
<25-12,BECKETT>不太可能
<25-12,BECKETT>Mm, doubtful.

650
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,640
<25-12,BECKETT>他五年前离开俄罗斯  消失了
<25-12,BECKETT>He left Russia five years ago and disappeared.

651
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,710
<25-13,ESPOSITO>从那之后  传言称他是
<25-13,ESPOSITO>Since then, word is that he's been responsible

652
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:33,440
<25-13,ESPOSITO>数十起暗杀事件的凶手
<25-13,ESPOSITO>for over two dozen assassinations.

653
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,740
<25-14,RYAN>包括政客  异见记者
<25-14,RYAN>Including politicians, dissident journalists,

654
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:38,040
<25-14,RYAN>受保护证人  甚至还有个梵蒂冈银行家
<25-14,RYAN>protected witnesses, even a Vatican banker.

655
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,350
<25-15,ESPOSITO>有别人完成不了的事
<25-15,ESPOSITO>Golovkin's the guy you call

656
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:40,940
<25-15,ESPOSITO>你就可以联系戈洛夫金
<25-15,ESPOSITO>when you have a job that no one else can do.

657
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:42,410
<25-16,BECKETT>卡塞尔  如果戈洛夫金也牵涉其中
<25-16,BECKETT>Castle, if Golovkin is involved,

658
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:43,140
<25-16,BECKETT>那不论是怎么回事
<25-16,BECKETT>then whatever's going on,

659
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:45,610
<25-16,BECKETT>不论你参与了什么  肯定是个大事情
<25-16,BECKETT>whatever you were a part of, it's something big.

660
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,300
<26-1,BECKETT>给你
<26-1,BECKETT>Here you go.

661
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:58,870
<26-2,CASTLE>你们如何追查像戈洛夫金这样的人
<26-2,CASTLE>How do we even track down a guy like Golovkin?

662
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:00,150
<26-3,BECKETT>我们找了支援
<26-3,BECKETT>We called in reinforcements.

663
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:01,880
<26-3,BECKETT>我们和联调局协作
<26-3,BECKETT>We're coordinating with the FBI.

664
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:04,600
<26-3,BECKETT>每个州还有联邦执法机构
<26-3,BECKETT>Every state and federal law-enforcement agency

665
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,430
<26-3,BECKETT>都在找这个人
<26-3,BECKETT>is looking for this guy.

666
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:08,100
<26-3,BECKETT>等我们找到他了  你就会得到你的答案
<26-3,BECKETT>And when we find him, you will have your answers.

667
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:10,180
<26-3,BECKETT>他是唯一一个知道真相的人
<26-3,BECKETT>He's the only person who knows the truth.

668
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:14,590
<26-4,CASTLE>至少还有另外一个人也知道真相
<26-4,CASTLE>There's at least one other person who knows.

669
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:18,660
<26-4,CASTLE>我得看看鲍尔斯的档案
<26-4,CASTLE>I need to see Powers' file.

670
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,360
<26-4,CASTLE>第一比尔森银行
<26-4,CASTLE>信用卡

671
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,680
<27-1,BECKETT>你究竟是要找什么
<27-1,BECKETT>Exactly what are you hoping to find?

672
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:29,850
<27-1,BECKETT>我们已经翻遍了关于鲍尔斯为数不多的资料
<27-1,BECKETT>We already went over what little there is on Powers.

673
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:31,900
<27-2,CASTLE>是的  可你们要找的是凶手
<27-2,CASTLE>Yes, but you were looking for his killer.

674
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:34,570
<27-2,CASTLE>我要找的是这家伙
<27-2,CASTLE>I'm looking for this guy.

675
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:37,540
<27-3,CASTLE>詹金斯是这一切的幕后操纵者
<27-3,CASTLE>Jenkins is the mastermind behind this,

676
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:39,160
<27-3,CASTLE>不然就是幕后指使的副手
<27-3,CASTLE>or mastermind-adjacent.

677
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,460
<27-3,CASTLE>他说不定也去过泰国
<27-3,CASTLE>He was probably in Thailand.

678
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:42,540
<27-3,CASTLE>据我所知  他肯定在开那辆我坐的卡车
<27-3,CASTLE>For all I know, he was driving the truck I was in.

679
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:44,550
<27-4,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我们永远也找不到詹金斯
<27-4,BECKETT>Castle, we could never locate Jenkins,

680
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:46,020
<27-4,BECKETT>更不用说知道他的真名了
<27-4,BECKETT>Much less find his real name.

681
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:47,300
<27-5,CASTLE>说不定现在可以了呢
<27-5,CASTLE>But maybe now we can.

682
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:50,020
<27-5,CASTLE>如果詹金斯曾联系过鲍尔斯
<27-5,CASTLE>If Jenkins had contact with Powers,

683
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:52,430
<27-5,CASTLE>也许这里会有能让我们找到他的线索
<27-5,CASTLE>There may be evidence in here that can lead us to him.

684
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:55,250
<27-6,ESPOSITO>之前发的全境通缉有线索了
<27-6,ESPOSITO>Yo. We got a hit off that A.P.B.

685
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:57,140
<27-6,ESPOSITO>一名交警认为他看到了戈洛夫金
<27-6,ESPOSITO>A transit cop thinks he just saw Golovkin get off

686
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:59,150
<27-6,ESPOSITO>在谢里丹广场地铁站下来了
<27-6,ESPOSITO>a subway stop at Sheridan Square.

687
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:01,010
<27-7,BECKETT>那离杰夫·鲍尔斯的公寓只有半个街区
<27-7,BECKETT>That's half a block from Jeff Powers' apartment.

688
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:02,480
<27-8,ESPOSITO>是的  说不定他又回去了
<27-8,ESPOSITO>Yeah. Maybe he went back there.

00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:04,240

00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,890
<28-1,BECKETT>封条被人打开了  有人进去过了
<28-1,BECKETT>The seal is cut. Someone went inside.

693
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:47,240
<28-2,ESPOSITO>他说不定还在里面
<28-2,ESPOSITO>He might still be there.

694

<28-4,ESPOSITO>这是安珀  那个脱衣舞女郎
<28-4,ESPOSITO>That's Amber, the stripper.

<28-4,ESPOSITO>戈洛夫金肯定拷问过她了
<28-4,ESPOSITO>Golovkin must have questioned her.

699
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:15,160
<28-4,ESPOSITO>现在他肯定知道我们在追查他了
<28-4,ESPOSITO>Now he knows we're onto him.

700
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:16,330
<28-5,BECKETT>他带她到这里来
<28-5,BECKETT>Bringing her here was his way

701
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:17,810
<28-5,BECKETT>是想侮辱我们
<28-5,BECKETT>of rubbing our faces in it.

702
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:19,300
<28-6,ESPOSITO>是的  可他到底想怎样
<28-6,ESPOSITO>Yeah, but what's his angle?

703
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,520
<28-6,ESPOSITO>他究竟在找什么
<28-6,ESPOSITO>What's he after?

704
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:22,700
<28-7,BECKETT>我不知道  可不论是什么
<28-7,BECKETT>I don't know, but whatever it is,

705
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,600
<28-7,BECKETT>他肯定不会就此善罢甘休
<28-7,BECKETT>he's not gonna stop until he gets it.

706
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:42,160
<29-1,HOSTESS>晚上好  先生  有什么可以效劳的吗
<29-1,HOSTESS>Good evening, sir. How may I help you?

<29-2,CASTLE>其实  我是纽约警局的
<29-2,CASTLE>Actually, I'm working with the NYPD.

708
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,050
<29-2,CASTLE>我想  是否可以问你几个问题
<29-2,CASTLE>I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.

709
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,020
<29-2,CASTLE>你见过这个人
<29-2,CASTLE>Have you ever seen this man?

712
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,830
<29-3,HOSTESS>绝对常客
<29-3,HOSTESS>Very regular.

713
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:56,990
<29-4,CASTLE>事实上  过去的六个月中
<29-4,CASTLE>In fact, for the past six months,

714
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:59,950
<29-4,CASTLE>他每周二傍晚六点都会来这  风雨无阻
<29-4,CASTLE>he's come here, without fail, every tuesday at 6:00 PM.

715
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:01,320
<29-4,CASTLE>他是来这里约见什么人的吗
<29-4,CASTLE>Was he meeting anyone?

716
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:03,100
<29-5,HOSTESS>不  他总是一个人吃饭
<29-5,HOSTESS>No. He always dines alone.

717
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:04,360
<29-6,CASTLE>那这个人呢
<29-6,CASTLE>What about this man?

718

720
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,930
<29-7,HOSTESS>没有  我对这个人没有印象
<29-7,HOSTESS>No. He's not familiar to me.

721
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,510
<29-7,HOSTESS>-非常抱歉  -没事
<29-7,HOSTESS>- I'm sorry. - Of course.

722
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:13,890
<29-8,CASTLE>非常感谢
<29-8,CASTLE>Thank you for your time.

723
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,410
<30-1,CASTLE>你是谁
<30-1,CASTLE>Who are you?

724
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:42,920
<30-2,BILAL KHAN>你不应该来这里的
<30-2,BILAL KHAN>You should never have come.

725
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:45,620
<30-2,BILAL KHAN>如果你都找到这了  那我就是个死人了
<30-2,BILAL KHAN>If you're here, it means that I'm a dead man.

726
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:47,350
<30-3,CASTLE>我以为你已经死了呢
<30-3,CASTLE>I thought you already were a dead man.

727
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,150
<30-4,CASTLE>你哪儿也不许去
<30-4,CASTLE>You're not going anywhere

728
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:51,670
<30-4,CASTLE>你得先告诉我这一切究竟是怎么回事
<30-4,CASTLE>until you tell me what the hell's going on.

729
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,370
<30-5,BILAL>好吧
<30-5,BILAL>Fine.

730
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,660
<30-5,BILAL>我们现在就得走  马上
<30-5,BILAL>We must leave. Now.

731
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:05,580
<30-5,BILAL>我们要去哪里
<30-5,BILAL>Where are we going?

732
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:09,930
<31-1,CASTLE>这是什么地方
<31-1,CASTLE>What is this place?

733
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,530
<31-2,BILAL>他们向我保证过你不会想起来的
<31-2,BILAL>They promised me you wouldn't remember.

734
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,120
<31-2,BILAL>你是怎么找到我的
<31-2,BILAL>How did you find me?

735
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:19,570
<31-3,CASTLE>杰夫·鲍尔斯
<31-3,CASTLE>Jeff Powers.

736
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,370
<31-4,BILAL>鲍尔斯永远不会开口的  除非...
<31-4,BILAL>Powers would never talk. Unless...

737
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:26,250
<31-4,BILAL>他已经死了  是不是
<31-4,BILAL>He's dead, isn't he?

738
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,110
<31-5,CASTLE>什么时候
<31-5,CASTLE>When?

739
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:31,270
<31-6,BILAL>-昨天  -是那个俄国人干的
<31-6,BILAL>- Yesterday. - Was it the Russian?

740
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,870
<31-7,CASTLE>你也知道那个俄国人  怎么会
<31-7,CASTLE>You know about the Russian? How?

741
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:35,450
<31-8,BILAL>这比我想的还要糟糕
<31-8,BILAL>This is even worse than I thought.

742
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:36,360
<31-9,CASTLE>你在给谁打电话
<31-9,CASTLE>Who are you calling?

743
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,840
<31-10,BILAL>这是伊卡洛斯  我这有个791状况
<31-10,BILAL>This is Icarus. I've got a code 7-9-1.

744
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:42,220
<31-11,CASTLE>那是什么意思  快告诉我你是谁
<31-11,CASTLE>What does that mean? Just tell me who you are.

745
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:43,950
<31-12,BILAL>我叫比拉
<31-12,BILAL>I'm Bilal.

746
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:46,890
<31-12,BILAL>比拉·汉
<31-12,BILAL>Bilal Khan.

747
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:49,350
<31-12,BILAL>我不认识我
<31-12,BILAL>You really don't know me.

748
00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:51,130
<31-13,CASTLE>我记得你也在那卡车里  受伤了
<31-13,CASTLE>I know you were in the truck, wounded.

749
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,280
<31-14,BILAL>在那之前很久  我是你的朋友
<31-14,BILAL>Long before that, I was your friend.

750
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,190
<31-15,CASTLE>你在说什么
<31-15,CASTLE>What are you talking about?

751
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:57,930
<31-16,BILAL>十一年级时我是菲克罗夫特预科学校的交换生
<31-16,BILAL>I was an exchange student at Faircroft Prp in 11th grade.

752
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,000
<31-17,CASTLE>你不是  不然我会记得的
<31-17,CASTLE>You weren't. I'd remember that.

753
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:01,400
<31-17,CASTLE>你早就不记得了
<31-17,CASTLE>Not anymore.

754
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,580
<31-18,BILAL>看见没
<31-18,BILAL>You see?

755
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:05,290
<31-18,BILAL>我们两个  一起
<31-18,BILAL>The two of us, together.

756
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:07,760
<31-18,BILAL>过去的美好时光
<31-18,BILAL>The good old days.

757
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,310
<31-19,CASTLE>这是那个奖杯...
<31-19,CASTLE>That's the trophy --

758
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:11,550
<31-19,CASTLE>我以为我是和菲尔·巴莱特一起得的奖
<31-19,CASTLE>The one I thought I won with Phil Bartlett.

759
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,830
<31-20,BILAL>因为他们必须把你有关我的记忆都抹去
<31-20,BILAL>That's because they had to erase all your memories of me

760
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:15,700
<31-20,BILAL>然后换成别人的
<31-20,BILAL>and replace them with somebody else.

761
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:16,780
<31-21,CASTLE>他们是谁
<31-21,CASTLE>Who are "they"?

762
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,710
<31-22,BILAL>真不敢相信他们挑了菲尔·巴莱特
<31-22,BILAL>I can't believe they picked Phil Bartlett.

763
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
<31-22,BILAL>那个蠢货
<31-22,BILAL>W-what a douchebag.

764
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
<31-23,CASTLE>听着  比拉...是叫比拉  对吧
<31-23,CASTLE>Listen, Bilal -- I-it's Bilal, right?

765
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:24,770
<31-23,CASTLE>即使你说的都是真的
<31-23,CASTLE>Even if what you said is true

766
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:26,960
<31-23,CASTLE>我们在11年级时就认识
<31-23,CASTLE>and we know each other in 11th grade --

767
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:27,870
<31-24,BILAL>你写第一本德里克·斯道姆小说时
<31-24,BILAL>You even consulted with me

768
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:30,160
<31-24,BILAL>甚至向我咨询过
<31-24,BILAL>when you wrote your first, uh, Derrick Storm book.

769
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,560
<31-25,CASTLE>咨询什么了
<31-25,CASTLE>Consulted about what?

770
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:33,220
<31-26,BILAL>恐怖主义
<31-26,BILAL>Terrorism.

771
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:36,000
<31-26,BILAL>鉴于我跟巴基斯坦情报部门合作紧密
<31-26,BILAL>Since I was working with, uh, pakistani intelligence,

772
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,110
<31-26,BILAL>我在这方面是专家
<31-26,BILAL>I was something of an expert on the topic.

773
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,980
<31-27,CASTLE>但这些又如何解释杰夫·鲍尔斯呢
<31-27,CASTLE>Okay, but how does that explain Jeff Powers?

774
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:41,980
<31-27,CASTLE>他为什么每个周二都去餐馆
<31-27,CASTLE>Why would he come to the restaurant every Tuesday?

775
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,170
<31-28,BILAL>查看我的情况
<31-28,BILAL>To check in with me.

776
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:46,350
<31-28,BILAL>他是我的指挥官  我在中情局的指挥官
<31-28,BILAL>He was my handler, my C.I.A. handler.

777
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,750
<31-28,BILAL>现在我的身份暴露
<31-28,BILAL>And now my cover's blown.

778
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:49,980
<31-29,CASTLE>你的身份  你是间谍
<31-29,CASTLE>Your cover? So you're a spy?

779
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:50,850
<31-30,BILAL>不是
<31-30,BILAL>Not a spy.

780
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:54,800
<31-30,BILAL>在我离开情报部门后
<31-30,BILAL>Look, after I left the intelligence service,

781
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:56,530
<31-30,BILAL>我失去了方向
<31-30,BILAL>I lost my way.

782
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,470
<31-30,BILAL>加入了基地组织
<31-30,BILAL>I joined Al-qaeda.

783
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,750
<32-1,CASTLE>你加入了基地组织
<32-1,CASTLE>You were in Al-qaeda?

784
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:07,350
<32-2,BILAL>你能小声点吗
<32-2,BILAL>Can you please keep your voice down?

785
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,690
<32-2,BILAL>是的
<32-2,BILAL>Yes, I was.

786
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:12,750
<32-2,BILAL>我成为他们高层领导的一员
<32-2,BILAL>I rose up to become a part of their senior leadership.

787
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:14,900
<32-3,CASTLE>而你现在当服务员  住在美国
<32-3,CASTLE>And now you're bussing tables and you live here?

788
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:17,310
<32-4,BILAL>这是我的选择  我的苦修
<32-4,BILAL>I chose this life. It's my penance.

789
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:19,150
<32-4,BILAL>我想离开基地组织
<32-4,BILAL>I wanted to leave Al-qaeda,

790
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:21,560
<32-4,BILAL>我手握组织的内部情报
<32-4,BILAL>and I had inside knowledge about that organization.

791
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,540
<32-4,BILAL>于是我跟美国情报部门达成协议
<32-4,BILAL>So I struck a deal with American intelligence

792
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:25,950
<32-4,BILAL>用我所知换来第二次机会
<32-4,BILAL>to trade what I knew for a second chance.

793
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:27,020
<32-5,CASTLE>你叛变了
<32-5,CASTLE>You defected.

794
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:28,510
<32-6,BILAL>如果你喜欢这种说法
<32-6,BILAL>If you like.

795
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,780
<32-6,BILAL>我躲在泰国的一个佛寺
<32-6,BILAL>I hid in a buddhist monastery in Thailand

796
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,620
<32-6,BILAL>在那我本应该与中情局联络人碰面
<32-6,BILAL>where I was supposed to meet my C.I.A. contact

797
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:34,620
<32-6,BILAL>拿到去美国的安全通行证
<32-6,BILAL>and get safe passage to the United States.

798
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,500
<32-6,BILAL>但事情出了岔子
<32-6,BILAL>But things didn't go as planned.

799
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:39,070
<32-7,CASTLE>这跟我有什么关系  我为什么也在
<32-7,CASTLE>And what does any of this have to do with me? Why was I there?

800
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,630
<32-8,BILAL>因为我需要你
<32-8,BILAL>Because I needed you.

801
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:45,460
<33-1,CASTLE>需要我  需要我干什么
<33-1,CASTLE>Needed me? Needed me for what?

802
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:47,670
<33-2,BILAL>当我准备把自己交到中情局手里时
<33-2,BILAL>I was about to turn myself over to the C.I.A.

803
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:48,930
<33-2,BILAL>我的联络人被杀
<33-2,BILAL>when my contact was killed

804
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:51,200
<33-2,BILAL>那颗子弹本来是冲我射出的
<33-2,BILAL>by a bullet that was meant for me.

805
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,770
<33-2,BILAL>碰头地点本应该是保密的
<33-2,BILAL>Now, the rendezvous point was supposed to be a secret.

806
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,120
<33-2,BILAL>也就说信息外露
<33-2,BILAL>Which means there was a leak.

807
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:56,420
<33-2,BILAL>我谁都不能相信
<33-2,BILAL>I could trust no one.

808
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:58,990
<33-2,BILAL>我手里有情报  于是同意再次碰头
<33-2,BILAL>I-I had some leverage, so I agreed to meet again,

809
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,670
<33-2,BILAL>但必须有我信任的人陪同
<33-2,BILAL>but only in the company of somebody I trusted,

810
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:02,590
<33-2,BILAL>我认识的人
<33-2,BILAL>somebody I knew.

811
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,830
<33-2,BILAL>某个很出名没法被暗杀的人
<33-2,BILAL>Somebody too prominent to be eliminated.

812
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:08,980
<33-2,BILAL>我只认识一个这样的人  你
<33-2,BILAL>I knew only one such man -- you.

813
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:10,540
<33-3,CASTLE>我们怎么跑到卡车里的
<33-3,CASTLE>How did we end up in that truck?

814
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:13,790
<33-4,BILAL>基地组织雇佣俄国佬追杀我
<33-4,BILAL>The Russian had been hunting me, hired by Al-qaeda.

815
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:15,260
<33-4,BILAL>他终于找上了我
<33-4,BILAL>He finally caught up with me.

816
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,210
<33-5,CASTLE>你就是那样受伤的
<33-5,CASTLE>That's how you got wounded.

817
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,840
<33-6,CASTLE>-我也受伤了吗  -很庆幸  没有
<33-6,CASTLE>- Was I wounded, too? - Fortunately, no.

818
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:24,810
<33-8,BILAL>车来了
<33-8,BILAL>My ride's here.

819
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:26,230
<33-9,CASTLE>我还有很多问题
<33-9,CASTLE>I still have a lot of questions.

820
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:28,090
<33-10,BILAL>没时间了  抱歉  里克
<33-10,BILAL>There's no more time. I-I'm sorry, Rick.

821
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:30,750
<33-10,BILAL>是我给你的生活制造了种种麻烦
<33-10,BILAL>Look, I was the cause of much upheaval in your life.

822
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,760
<33-10,BILAL>希望你能知道那不是我的本意
<33-10,BILAL>Please know that was never my intention.

823
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:34,810
<33-10,BILAL>事实上  我对你所做一切
<33-10,BILAL>In fact, I have the deepest gratitude

824
00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:36,190
<33-10,BILAL>感激涕零
<33-10,BILAL>for everything that you've done.

825
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,120
<33-11,CASTLE>真希望我能记得我做了什么
<33-11,CASTLE>I just wish I could remember what it was.

826
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:39,750
<33-12,BILAL>我也希望如此
<33-12,BILAL>As do I.

827
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:42,700
<33-12,BILAL>估计我们不会再见面了
<33-12,BILAL>I doubt we'll meet again.

828
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:43,560
<33-12,BILAL>祝好
<33-12,BILAL>Be well.

829
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:56,560
<33-13,ILYA GOLOVKIN>走到暗处
<33-13,ILYA GOLOVKIN>Come away from the light.

830
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,310
<33-14,GOLOVKIN>快
<33-14,GOLOVKIN>Come.

831
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:09,710
<33-15,CASTLE>听着  我跟这一切无关
<33-15,CASTLE>Look, I'm -- I'm... i'm not part of this.

832
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:12,070
<33-15,CASTLE>我什么都不知道
<33-15,CASTLE>I know absolutely nothing.

833
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:13,420
<33-16,GOLOVKIN>那不重要
<33-16,GOLOVKIN>It does not matter.

834
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:31,790
<33-17,HENRY JENKINS>我以为我们说好的
<33-17,HENRY JENKINS>I thought we had an understanding

835
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,590
<33-17,HENRY JENKINS>你不会追查此事
<33-17,HENRY JENKINS>that you wouldn't pursue this.

836
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,500
<33-18,CASTLE>詹金斯
<33-18,CASTLE>Jenkins.

837
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,620
<33-19,JENKINS>你得忘记比拉·汉
<33-19,JENKINS>Well, you'll have to forget about Bilal Khan

838
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:39,340
<33-19,JENKINS>和今天发生的一切
<33-19,JENKINS>and everything else that's occurred tonight.

839
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:44,220
<33-20,CASTLE>你要帮我忘记吗
<33-20,CASTLE>Are you gonna help me to forget?

840
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:45,580
<33-21,JENKINS>最好不要
<33-21,JENKINS>We'd prefer not to.

841
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:50,240
<33-22,CASTLE>那谢谢你了
<33-22,CASTLE>Yes, well... thank you for that.

842
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:52,420
<33-22,CASTLE>还有...
<33-22,CASTLE>Oh, and, uh...

843
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:57,350
<33-23,CASTLE>这一拳是为了错过我的婚礼
<33-23,CASTLE>That's for making me miss my wedding day.

844
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:06,310
<33-24,JENKINS>你不知道你有多幸运  卡塞尔先生
<33-24,JENKINS>You have no idea how lucky you are, Mr. Castle.

845
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,570
<33-24,JENKINS>至于错过婚礼  那是不可避免的
<33-24,JENKINS>As for missing your wedding, that was unavoidable,

846
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:12,250
<33-24,JENKINS>-如果这能让你有些慰藉  -不能
<33-24,JENKINS>- If it's any consolation. - It's not.

847
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:14,000
<33-25,CASTLE>你拽着我转了大半个地球
<33-25,CASTLE>You dragged me halfway across the world.

848
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,330
<33-25,CASTLE>你欠我个解释
<33-25,CASTLE>You owe me an explanation.

849
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:17,030
<33-26,JENKINS>我不能告诉你
<33-26,JENKINS>I'm not at liberty to give you one.

850
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:19,490
<33-27,CASTLE>那我也不能忘记比拉·汉
<33-27,CASTLE>Well, then I'm not at liberty to forget about Bilal Khan.

851
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:21,000
<33-27,CASTLE>或是戈洛夫金
<33-27,CASTLE>Or Golovkin here.

852
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:22,460
<33-28,JENKINS>-卡塞尔先生  -怎么
<33-28,JENKINS>- Mr. Castle -- - What?

<33-29,CASTLE>你要杀我吗  你杀不了
<33-29,CASTLE>You gonna kill me? You can't.

854
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:27,110
<33-29,CASTLE>会引发太多疑问
<33-29,CASTLE>Raise too many questions.

855
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:30,710
<33-29,CASTLE>所以你把我从泰国带回来
<33-29,CASTLE>That's why you brought me back from Thailand,

856
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:32,560
<33-29,CASTLE>洗去我的记忆
<33-29,CASTLE>Minus my memory.

857
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:35,260
<33-29,CASTLE>我失踪两个月  都是因为你
<33-29,CASTLE>I was gone two months thanks to you.

858
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,290
<33-29,CASTLE>我错过了我的婚礼
<33-29,CASTLE>I missed my wedding.

859
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:40,020
<33-29,CASTLE>是什么事  就不能再等一天
<33-29,CASTLE>What couldn't wait one more day?

860
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:42,260
<33-30,JENKINS>时间紧迫
<33-30,JENKINS>There was a ticking clock.

861
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:44,690
<33-30,JENKINS>我们听闻
<33-30,JENKINS>We'd picked up chatter

862
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:47,300
<33-30,JENKINS>基地组织要袭击美国
<33-30,JENKINS>about a major Al-qaeda strike in the U.S.

863
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,520
<33-30,JENKINS>我们知道袭击几小时内就要进行  没时间
<33-30,JENKINS>We knew it was hours away and there was never enough time

864
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:53,140
<33-30,JENKINS>搜集线索  阻止他们
<33-30,JENKINS>for us to put the pieces together in order to stop it.

865
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:56,450
<33-31,CASTLE>但比拉知道袭击的事
<33-31,CASTLE>But Bilal knew about the strike.

866
00:39:56,450 --> 00:39:59,010
<33-32,JENKINS>人名  地点  行动细节
<33-32,JENKINS>Names, places, operational details, yeah.

867
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:01,430
<33-32,JENKINS>我们迫切需要比拉和他的情报
<33-32,JENKINS>We were desperate for Bilal and his intel.

868
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:03,320
<33-32,JENKINS>他的联络人被杀后
<33-32,JENKINS>And when his contact was killed,

869
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:06,410
<33-32,JENKINS>我们需要你来得到比拉
<33-32,JENKINS>we needed you to get Bilal.

870
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:09,040
<33-32,JENKINS>他交代了一切
<33-32,JENKINS>And he came through.

871
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:12,120
<33-32,JENKINS>我们得以阻止袭击
<33-32,JENKINS>We were able to prevent the strike,

872
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,710
<33-32,JENKINS>将参与的人全部除掉
<33-32,JENKINS>and we neutralized everyone involved.

873
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:18,010
<33-32,JENKINS>我只能说这么多
<33-32,JENKINS>That's all I can tell you.

874
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:21,150
<33-32,JENKINS>希望你不要对别人重复
<33-32,JENKINS>And I expect you not to repeat it.

875
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:25,770
<33-33,JENKINS>这么想  的确  你错过了婚礼
<33-33,JENKINS>Think of it this way -- yeah, you missed your wedding,

876
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:30,290
<34-1,MARTHA>但你解救了成百上千人的性命
<34-1,MARTHA>but you also saved tens of thousands of lives.

877
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,090
<33-33,JENKINS>你该走了  卡塞尔先生
<33-33,JENKINS>You should leave now, Mr. Castle.

878
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,960
<34-1,MARTHA>你解救了成百上千人的性命
<34-1,MARTHA>You saved tens of thousands of lives?

879
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,650
<34-2,ALEXIS>去泰国执行秘密任务
<34-2,ALEXIS>And went on a secret mission to Thailand?

880
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:48,170
<34-3,CASTLE>是的  但我不能透露更多
<34-3,CASTLE>Yes. Unfortunately, I cannot divulge any further specifics.

881
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:49,700
<34-4,ALEXIS>告诉我们  就得杀了我们
<34-4,ALEXIS>If you told us, you'd have to kill us.

882
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:52,120
<34-5,CASTLE>贫嘴  都是为了你们的安全
<34-5,CASTLE>You mock, but it is for your own safety.

883
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:54,530
<34-6,ALEXIS>重要的是
<34-6,ALEXIS>I guess what really matters is,

884
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:57,050
<34-6,ALEXIS>你知道了真相  老爸  好消息是
<34-6,ALEXIS>you found out the truth, dad, and the good news is,

885
00:40:57,050 --> 00:40:59,050
<34-6,ALEXIS>不是什么很糟的事情
<34-6,ALEXIS>it didn't turn out to be your worse-case scenario.

886
00:40:59,050 --> 00:41:01,220
<34-7,CASTLE>坏消息是
<34-7,CASTLE>Yeah, bad news is,

887
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:04,460
<34-7,CASTLE>我没法把英雄壮举到处吹嘘
<34-7,CASTLE>I can't brag about my heroic exploits to anyone.

888
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,900
<34-8,ALEXIS>现在不就在吹嘘
<34-8,ALEXIS>Though you're kind of doing that right now.

889
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:07,700
<34-9,CASTLE>完全是
<34-9,CASTLE>Totally.

890
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:12,660
<34-10,ALEXIS>-我去学习了  -拜拜
<34-10,ALEXIS>- I have to go study. - See you.

891
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:15,010
<34-11,CASTLE>亲爱的  阿莱克西斯和我
<34-11,CASTLE>You know, darling, Alexis and I

892
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:16,660
<34-12,MARTHA>不需要知道细节
<34-12,MARTHA>do not need to know the details.

893
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:18,860
<34-12,MARTHA>但我希望你能告诉凯瑟琳
<34-12,MARTHA>But I do hope you can tell Katherine.

894
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:19,750
<34-13,CASTLE>当然
<34-13,CASTLE>Of course.

895
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:23,430
<34-14,BECKETT>我尽快赶回来
<34-14,BECKETT>I got here as soon as I could.

896
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,700
<34-15,CASTLE>不够快
<34-15,CASTLE>Never soon enough.

897
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,590
<35-1,BECKETT>你没事我很开心
<35-1,BECKETT>I'm just glad that you're okay.

898
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,130
<35-2,CASTLE>别告诉阿莱克西斯和老妈
<35-2,CASTLE>Um, don't tell Alexis or mother

899
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:33,840
<35-2,CASTLE>俄罗斯杀手的事
<35-2,CASTLE>about the Russian-assassin part.

900
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:34,960
<35-2,CASTLE>那部分我略过了
<35-2,CASTLE>I left that out of the story.

901
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:37,490
<35-3,BECKETT>小巷里发生的事
<35-3,BECKETT>Yeah, well, um, there's no proof

902
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,560
<35-3,BECKETT>无凭无证
<35-3,BECKETT>of what happened in that alley.

903
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,990
<35-3,BECKETT>等警员赶到时  尸体已经不见了
<35-3,BECKETT>By the time uniforms got there, his body was already gone.

904
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,790
<35-4,CASTLE>如果詹金斯能抹去记忆
<35-4,CASTLE>If Jenkins can get rid of memories,

905
00:41:45,790 --> 00:41:47,820
<35-4,CASTLE>处理尸体小菜一碟
<35-4,CASTLE>getting rid of a body would be child's play.

906
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,730
<35-4,CASTLE>我很抱歉  凯特
<35-4,CASTLE>I am so sorry, Kate,

907
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:54,220
<35-4,CASTLE>为那些我令你经历的事
<35-4,CASTLE>for everything I put you through.

908
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:56,820
<35-5,BECKETT>宝贝  你又不是在泰国开派对
<35-5,BECKETT>Babe, it's not like you were partying in Thailand.

909
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:59,650
<35-5,BECKETT>错过婚礼  你有最好的借口
<35-5,BECKETT>You have the best excuse ever for missing our wedding.

910
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:00,900
<35-5,BECKETT>你在拯救世界
<35-5,BECKETT>You were saving the world.

911
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,340
<35-6,CASTLE>是啊  但还是有很多未回答的问题
