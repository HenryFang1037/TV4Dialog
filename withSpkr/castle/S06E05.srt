1
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,130
<1-1,OLDER MAN>混蛋
<1-1,OLDER MAN>Jackass.

11
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,720
<2-1,RICHARD CASTLE>天呐
<2-1,RICHARD CASTLE>Aah! Ow! God!

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,390
<2-2,PI>你还好吧  C先生
<2-2,PI>Everything okay, Mr. C.?

13
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:06,690
<2-3,CASTLE>你说呢  派
<2-3,CASTLE>Does everything look okay, Pi?!

14
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,140
<2-4,PI>不好说  这儿有点暗啊
<2-4,PI>Uh, I don't know. It's kinda dark in here.

15
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:11,990
<2-5,ALEXIS CASTLE>爸爸  你怎么了  出什么事了
<2-5,ALEXIS CASTLE>Dad? Wh-what's going on? What happened?

16
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:14,620
<2-6,CASTLE>立刻去我书房
<2-6,CASTLE>My office. Now.

17
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:27,040
<3-1,CASTLE>我已经尽量大度  体谅了
<3-1,CASTLE>I've tried to be generous and understanding.

18
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,890
<3-1,CASTLE>我已经很包容了
<3-1,CASTLE>I have tried to be tolerant.

19
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:31,100
<3-1,CASTLE>但是阿丽克西斯  这都一个多月了
<3-1,CASTLE>But, Alexis, it's been over a month,

20
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:32,460
<3-1,CASTLE>派居然还在这儿
<3-1,CASTLE>and Pi is still here.

21
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,010
<3-2,ALEXIS>我知道
<3-2,ALEXIS>I know, dad.

22
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,340
<3-2,ALEXIS>他和我都挺不好意思的
<3-2,ALEXIS>And he feels bad about it. We both do.

23
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,330
<3-3,CASTLE>我才不管他好不好意思
<3-3,CASTLE>I don't care if he feels bad.

24
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:38,970
<3-3,CASTLE>我要我的沙发
<3-3,CASTLE>I want my couch back.

25
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:41,020
<3-3,CASTLE>我要我的房子
<3-3,CASTLE>I want my house back.

26
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,210
<3-3,CASTLE>你下周就回大学了  到时候怎么办
<3-3,CASTLE>You go back to college next week. What then?

27
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,620
<3-3,CASTLE>亲爱的  他必须走人
<3-3,CASTLE>Sweetheart, he has to go.

28
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:49,240
<3-4,ALEXIS>你说得对
<3-4,ALEXIS>You're absolutely right.

29
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,350
<3-4,ALEXIS>他的确待的太长了
<3-4,ALEXIS>He's been here way too long.

30
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:52,100
<3-4,ALEXIS>这不应该  对你不公平
<3-4,ALEXIS>It's not right, and it's not fair to you.

31
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,500
<3-5,CASTLE>谢谢
<3-5,CASTLE>Thank you.

32
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,660
<3-6,ALEXIS>不客气
<3-6,ALEXIS>You're welcome.

33
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:57,550
<3-6,ALEXIS>好消息是  我们好像找到地方了
<3-6,ALEXIS>And the best news is, I think we found a place.

34
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,630
<3-7,CASTLE>亲爱的  真是太棒了
<3-7,CASTLE>Honey, that is so great.

35
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:01,290
<3-7,CASTLE>你是说"我们找到地方了"吗
<3-7,CASTLE>Did you say "We found a place"?

36
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,360
<3-8,ALEXIS>是啊  派和我谈过了
<3-8,ALEXIS>Yeah. Pi and I talked it over.

37
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,640
<3-8,ALEXIS>他自己租不起公寓
<3-8,ALEXIS>He can't afford a place on his own,

38
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,860
<3-8,ALEXIS>所以我们找到了一处合租
<3-8,ALEXIS>So we found one together.

39
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,270
<3-9,CASTLE>-合租  -对
<3-9,CASTLE>- Together? - Yeah.

40
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,080
<3-10,ALEXIS>这样我们都付得起房租
<3-10,ALEXIS>That way, the rent's totally affordable.

41
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,100
<3-10,ALEXIS>我的部分半工半读就能交得起
<3-10,ALEXIS>I can cover my half with a work-study job,

42
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,430
<3-10,ALEXIS>而且就在学校附近
<3-10,ALEXIS>and it's right next to school.

43
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,330
<3-10,ALEXIS>再说  这样你今年
<3-10,ALEXIS>Plus it'll save you having to pay

44
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:17,620
<3-10,ALEXIS>就不用付宿舍钱了
<3-10,ALEXIS>for university housing this year.

45
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:21,640
<3-11,CASTLE>你不会真认为我会让你这么做吧
<3-11,CASTLE>You don't honestly think I'm gonna let you do this, do you?

46
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,570
<3-12,ALEXIS>让我  爸爸  我都19了
<3-12,ALEXIS>Let me? Dad, I'm 19.

47
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:26,270
<3-13,CASTLE>没错啊
<3-13,CASTLE>Exactly my point.

48
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:29,100
<3-13,CASTLE>年纪轻轻哪能就这么跟人同居
<3-13,CASTLE>Far too young to be moving in with someone.

49
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,940
<3-14,ALEXIS>是吗  因为我已经到了可以签租约的年龄了
<3-14,ALEXIS>Really? Because I was old enough to sign the lease.

50
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:33,800
<3-14,ALEXIS>况且你19岁时不是也跟女友同居了吗
<3-14,ALEXIS>And weren't you living with your girlfriend when you were 19?

51
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,900
<3-15,CASTLE>对  但那不一样
<3-15,CASTLE>Yes. But that was different.

52
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,260
<3-16,ALEXIS>怎么不一样
<3-16,ALEXIS>How?

53
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,660
<3-17,ALEXIS>相信我  爸爸  我们都想清楚了
<3-17,ALEXIS>Trust me, dad. We've thought this through.

54
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,990
<3-17,ALEXIS>这绝对是正确的决定
<3-17,ALEXIS>It makes total sense.

55
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:48,110
<4-1,CASTLE>这怎么能算正确的决定啊
<4-1,CASTLE>In what universe does that make sense?

56
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,050
<4-1,CASTLE>我告诉你吧
<4-1,CASTLE>I'll tell you what universe--

57
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,520
<4-1,CASTLE>她就是被感情蒙蔽了双眼  想不清楚
<4-1,CASTLE>the one where she's blinded by emotion and not thinking straight.

58
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,390
<4-1,CASTLE>简直想看慢动作的车祸
<4-1,CASTLE>It's like watching a car accident in slow motion.

59
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,170
<4-2,KATE BECKETT>知道吗  卡塞尔  我爸爸想
<4-2,KATE BECKETT>You know, Castle, my dad wanted to kill

60
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:58,420
<4-2,KATE BECKETT>杀了我第一个同居男友
<4-2,KATE BECKETT>the first guy that I moved in with.

61
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,860
<4-2,KATE BECKETT>他想尽办法想劝我别那么做
<4-2,KATE BECKETT>He did everything he could to try and talk me out of it,

62
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:03,360
<4-2,KATE BECKETT>结果只让我更坚定了信心
<4-2,KATE BECKETT>and all that did was make me want to do it even more.

63
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,150
<4-3,CASTLE>真希望未来的她
<4-3,CASTLE>I wish her future self would come back

64
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,490
<4-3,CASTLE>能来跟现在的她谈谈
<4-3,CASTLE>and talk to her present self,

65
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:07,880
<4-3,CASTLE>让她知道这是个大错误
<4-3,CASTLE>let her know what a mistake she's making,

66
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,740
<4-3,CASTLE>让她免遭
<4-3,CASTLE>Save her from a...

67
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,020
<4-3,CASTLE>伤害
<4-3,CASTLE>a world of hurt.

68
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:14,570
<4-4,BECKETT>怎么回事
<4-4,BECKETT>What happened?

69
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,350
<4-5,LANIE PARISH>要我说  这世上就是有太多
<4-5,LANIE PARISH>A lot of weirdos out there with too much imagination

70
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:18,570
<4-4,BECKETT>想象力太丰富的怪胎
<4-4,BECKETT>is what happened.

71
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:20,490
<4-5,LANIE PARISH>没错  说的就是你  卡塞尔
<4-5,LANIE PARISH>And, yes, I'm looking at you, Castle.

72
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,970
<4-6,CASTLE>但是我只在纸上犯罪
<4-6,CASTLE>Yeah, except I only commit my murders on paper.

73
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:25,540
<4-6,CASTLE>并不真正动手  票子多多  不蹲号子
<4-6,CASTLE>I don't actually do them. A lot more lucrative, a lot less prison.

74
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,150
<4-7,BECKETT>她受了电刑吗
<4-7,BECKETT>So was she electrocuted?

75
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,370
<4-8,LANIE>对  但那不是死因
<4-8,LANIE>Yeah, but that's not the cause of death.

76
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,690
<4-8,LANIE>她被人割喉  还有这些
<4-8,LANIE>Her throat was cut. And the rest of this,

77
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,820
<4-8,LANIE>要我猜  她受了好一番刑呢
<4-8,LANIE>if I had to guess, I'd say she was tortured.

78
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,340
<4-9,CASTLE>为什么  她是谁
<4-9,CASTLE>Why? Who is she?

79
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,940
<4-10,JAVIER ESPOSITO>萨娜·泰勒  34岁
<4-10,JAVIER ESPOSITO>Shauna Taylor, 34.

80
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:39,160
<4-10,JAVIER ESPOSITO>惩治局的假释官
<4-10,JAVIER ESPOSITO>She's a parole office with the department of corrections.

81
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,220
<4-10,JAVIER ESPOSITO>或许是哪个假释犯的报复
<4-10,JAVIER ESPOSITO>Could be one of her parolees out for revenge.

82
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:43,320
<4-11,BECKETT>-他怎么进来的  -暂时不知道
<4-11,BECKETT>- How did he get in? - Right now it's a mystery.

83
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,210
<4-12,ESPOSITO>没有强行闯入的迹象  并且看来
<4-12,ESPOSITO>There's no sign of forced entry, and from the look of it,

84
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:46,530
<4-12,ESPOSITO>她不知道有人要找她麻烦
<4-12,ESPOSITO>she wasn't expecting trouble.

85
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,380
<4-13,CASTLE>你怎么知道
<4-13,CASTLE>How can you tell that?

86
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:49,580
<4-14,ESPOSITO>她有个西格9的佩枪许可证
<4-14,ESPOSITO>She had a carry permit for a sig .9.

87
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:51,380
<4-14,ESPOSITO>枪还放在她床头柜的第一个抽屉里
<4-14,ESPOSITO>Still in the top drawer of her nightstand.

88
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:52,960
<4-15,BECKETT>我们知道死亡时间吗
<4-15,BECKETT>Do we know when this happened?

89
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:55,690
<4-16,LANIE>得等回到验尸房才能给出定论
<4-16,LANIE>I won't have anything definitive until I get her back to the office.

90
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:57,260
<4-17,ESPOSITO>邻居什么都没听到
<4-17,ESPOSITO>Neighbors didn't hear anything,

91
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,850
<4-17,ESPOSITO>大概是因为她被堵住了嘴
<4-17,ESPOSITO>Probably because she was gagged.

92
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:00,530
<4-17,ESPOSITO>报案的人说他看见
<4-17,ESPOSITO>But the guy who called it in said that he saw

93
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:02,520
<4-17,ESPOSITO>有人凌晨5点半离开了公寓
<4-17,ESPOSITO>a guy leaving the apartment around 5:30 a.m.

94
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:04,140
<4-17,ESPOSITO>而且他身上还沾了鲜血
<4-17,ESPOSITO>Said the dude had fresh blood on him.

95
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,080
<4-17,ESPOSITO>莱恩让证人跟素描师做描述了
<4-17,ESPOSITO>Ryan's got our witness with the sketch artist now.

96
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,580
<4-18,BECKETT>联系惩治局  拿到她所有假释犯的名单
<4-18,BECKETT>Okay, contact D.O.C., get a list of all of her parolees,

97
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,390
<4-18,BECKETT>看看有没有匹配记录
<4-18,BECKETT>see if there's a match.

98
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:12,070
<4-18,BECKETT>并让他们所有人给出昨晚的不在场证明
<4-18,BECKETT>We're also gonna need alibis for all of them from last night.

99
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,710
<4-19,BECKETT>对她家庭有什么了解
<4-19,BECKETT>What do we know about her family?

100
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,110
<4-19,BECKETT>她死了
<4-19,BECKETT>She's dead?

101
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,210
<5-1,MALCOLM WICKFIELD>我就知道
<5-1,MALCOLM WICKFIELD>I knew it!

102
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:22,530
<5-1,MALCOLM WICKFIELD>我就知道会发生这种事
<5-1,MALCOLM WICKFIELD>I knew something like this would happen.

103
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,840
<5-1,MALCOLM WICKFIELD>我早就说过了
<5-1,MALCOLM WICKFIELD>I warned her, didn't I?

104
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,220
<5-1,MALCOLM WICKFIELD>她热爱她的工作
<5-1,MALCOLM WICKFIELD>She loved her job.

105
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,230
<5-2,BECKETT>她喜欢帮助人们重拾生活
<5-2,BECKETT>She loved helping people get their lives back on track.

106
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:31,490
<5-2,BECKETT>威克福德博士  你和你继妹关系好吗
<5-2,BECKETT>Dr. Wickfield, were you and your stepsister close?

107
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,130
<5-3,MALCOLM>不算是
<5-3,MALCOLM>Not really.

108
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,560
<5-3,MALCOLM>我们两个的生活轨迹很不同
<5-3,MALCOLM>The two of us had very different lives.

109
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,440
<5-3,MALCOLM>父亲死后  我们努力了
<5-3,MALCOLM>Since our father passed, we made an effort,

110
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,060
<5-3,MALCOLM>每个月也就给彼此打一两次电话
<5-3,MALCOLM>called each other once, maybe twice a month.

111
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:42,620
<5-4,BECKETT>你上次跟她通话的时候
<5-4,BECKETT>And when you last spoke to her,

112
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,410
<5-4,BECKETT>她说过什么话  让你觉得她可能有麻烦吗
<5-4,BECKETT>did she say anything that would indicate she was in trouble?

113
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,410
<5-5,MALCOLM>嗯  我们一周前通过话
<5-5,MALCOLM>Yeah. When we--we talked about a week ago.

114
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:51,280
<5-5,MALCOLM>她觉得可能有人在跟踪她
<5-5,MALCOLM>She said she thought someone might be stalking her.

115
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,180
<5-5,MALCOLM>她不论去哪都能看到一个人  盯着她看
<5-5,MALCOLM>She kept seeing this guy wherever she went, watching her.

116
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,450
<5-6,CASTLE>是她的假释犯吗
<5-6,CASTLE>One of her parolees?

117
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,090
<5-7,MALCOLM>不  她说她不认识他
<5-7,MALCOLM>No. She said she didn't recognize him.

118
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,630
<5-7,MALCOLM>我以为是她想多了呢
<5-7,MALCOLM>I thought maybe she was just being paranoid.

119
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:06,020
<6-1,KEVIN RYAN>据萨娜的上司说
<6-1,KEVIN RYAN>So according to Shauna's supervisor,

120
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:08,200
<6-1,KEVIN RYAN>她的假释犯都不是暴力伤人犯
<6-1,KEVIN RYAN>all of her parolees were nonviolent offenders,

121
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,660
<6-1,KEVIN RYAN>而且也找不到跟邻居描述这副画像
<6-1,KEVIN RYAN>and none of them looked like this sketch

122
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,050
<6-1,KEVIN RYAN>相吻合的人
<6-1,KEVIN RYAN>that we took off the neighbor

123
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:15,830
<6-1,KEVIN RYAN>他们的指纹与鉴证组在犯罪现场采到的也不匹配
<6-1,KEVIN RYAN>or match prints that C.S.U. got from the crime scene.

124
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:18,920
<6-2,BECKETT>所以说可能这事跟她的工作毫无关系
<6-2,BECKETT>So it's quite possible this had nothing to do with her job?

125
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:21,120
<6-3,CASTLE>那何必给她上刑  凶手想要什么
<6-3,CASTLE>Then why torture her? What could the killer want?

126
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,190
<6-4,RYAN>怎么  卡塞尔  没有疯狂理论吗
<6-4,RYAN>What, Castle, no crazy theories?

127
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,740
<6-5,BECKETT>他有更烦的事要想呢
<6-5,BECKETT>Oh, he's got bigger issues.

128
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:27,550
<6-5,BECKETT>他女儿要跟一个男孩同居了
<6-5,BECKETT>His daughter's moving in with a boy.

129
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,470
<6-6,RYAN>你居然不管吗
<6-6,RYAN>And you're letting her?

130
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:32,840
<6-7,CASTLE>显然阻止她的唯一方法就是把她关起来
<6-7,CASTLE>Well, apparently the only way to stop her is locking her up,

131
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,320
<6-7,CASTLE>但据这位"遵纪守法"小姐说
<6-7,CASTLE>but according to Miss by-the-book here,

132
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:35,810
<6-7,CASTLE>那是非法监禁
<6-7,CASTLE>that's unlawful imprisonment.

133
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,820
<6-8,ESPOSITO>那个跟踪者有消息了
<6-8,ESPOSITO>Hey. Caught a break on that stalker.

134
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,620
<6-8,ESPOSITO>几晚前  萨娜提起了 一次骚扰投诉
<6-8,ESPOSITO>Couple nights ago, Shauna filed a harassment complaint.

135
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,090
<6-8,ESPOSITO>三天前  有人在萨娜下班回家的路上
<6-8,ESPOSITO>Apparently, three days ago, a guy confronted Shauna

136
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:44,340
<6-8,ESPOSITO>拦住了她
<6-8,ESPOSITO>on her way home from work.

137
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:47,190
<6-8,ESPOSITO>跟她说地球上一半的人危在旦夕
<6-8,ESPOSITO>Said the lives of half the people on the planet were at stake.

138
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:49,250
<6-9,CASTLE>不管我能想出什么疯狂理论
<6-9,CASTLE>Whatever crazy theory I could have come up with,

139
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,670
<6-9,CASTLE>都不如这个
<6-9,CASTLE>this is better.

140
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:52,290
<6-10,ESPOSITO>她想办法脱身并躲进了楼里
<6-10,ESPOSITO>She managed to get away and duck inside her building,

141
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:53,480
<6-10,ESPOSITO>但当她望向窗外时
<6-10,ESPOSITO>but when she looked out her window,

142
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,940
<6-10,ESPOSITO>他还在外面等着她  于是她报警了
<6-10,ESPOSITO>he was still out there waiting for her, so she called the cops.

143
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,410
<6-11,BECKETT>-他们把他抓起来了吗  -对
<6-11,BECKETT>- Did they pick him up? - Yeah.

144
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:59,640
<6-12,ESPOSITO>他没有身份证  而且他表现很奇怪
<6-12,ESPOSITO>He didn't have an I.D. And he was pretty much off his rocker,

145
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,280
<6-12,ESPOSITO>所以他们对他进行了72小时的精神病拘留
<6-12,ESPOSITO>so they put him on a 72-hour psych hold.

146
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,640
<6-12,ESPOSITO>他今天一大早被放走了
<6-12,ESPOSITO>He was released early this morning.

147
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:05,480
<6-12,ESPOSITO>他们一直没查到他的身份  但看看这个
<6-12,ESPOSITO>They were never able to I.D. him, but check it out.

148
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,950
<6-13,BECKETT>到精神科病房去  把他的记录拿来
<6-13,BECKETT>Get over to the psych ward. Pull his records.

149
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,390
<6-13,BECKETT>我们得查出他是谁
<6-13,BECKETT>We need to find out who he is.

150
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,900
<7-1,SIMON DOYLE>你不明白  我们就要没时间了
<7-1,SIMON DOYLE>You do not understand. We are running out of time.

151
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:19,780
<7-1,SIMON DOYLE>我得出去  你得放我出去
<7-1,SIMON DOYLE>I need to get out of here. You have to let me go!

152
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,370
<7-2,PSYCHIATRIST>-你为什么要出去  -拜托  我告诉过你
<7-2,PSYCHIATRIST>- Why do you feel you need to go? - Come on, I told you!

153
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:24,740
<7-4,PSYCHIATRIST>-我  她有危险  -谁有危险
<7-4,PSYCHIATRIST>- I--she is in danger! - Who is in danger?

154
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:27,260
<7-5,SIMON>你根本就没有听我说话  萨娜·泰勒
<7-5,SIMON>You're not even listening to me! Shauna Taylor!

155
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:31,930
<7-5,SIMON>我只知道12-58  他们只告诉我这么多
<7-5,SIMON>All I know is 12-58. That is all they told me, okay?

156
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:34,820
<7-5,SIMON>事情就是那样开始的  如果我不去阻止
<7-5,SIMON>That is how is starts, and if I am not there to stop it,

157
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,740
<7-5,SIMON>我们都得死
<7-5,SIMON>we are all dead!

158
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,700
<7-4,PSYCHIATRIST>你听懂了吗  都得死
<7-4,PSYCHIATRIST>Do you understand me? Dead!

159
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,400
<7-2,PSYCHIATRIST>你...
<7-2,PSYCHIATRIST>You...

160
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,810
<7-1,SIMON DOYLE>赶紧让我离开这儿
<7-1,SIMON DOYLE>Somebody has to let me out of here!

161
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:44,470
<7-5,SIMON>听我说  我得去救她
<7-5,SIMON>All right, listen to me! I need to save her!

162
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,690
<7-6,CASTLE>你觉得他说的救是杀的意思吗
<7-6,CASTLE>Do you think by "save," he meant kill?

163
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,770
<7-6,CASTLE>因为我觉得他听起来真的不想让她死
<7-6,CASTLE>Because it sounds to me like he really didn't want her to die.

164
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:49,910
<7-7,BECKETT>他有精神病
<7-7,BECKETT>He's mentally ill.

165
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,280
<7-7,BECKETT>他也许不知道区别
<7-7,BECKETT>He may not know the difference.

166
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,080
<7-8,RYAN>12-58  你觉得那是什么意思
<7-8,RYAN>12-58--what do you think that means?

167
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,250
<7-9,CASTLE>时间  地址  圣经章节
<7-9,CASTLE>Time. Address. Bible verse.

168
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:57,610
<7-10,BECKETT>又或许是...
<7-10,BECKETT>Or maybe it's...

169
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,730
<7-10,BECKETT>错乱的脑子里产生的随机数
<7-10,BECKETT>Random numbers from a disturbed mind.

170
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:03,350
<7-10,BECKETT>不管怎样  我们得找到他
<7-10,BECKETT>Either way, we got to find him.

171
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,110
<7-11,CASTLE>那家伙是个无名氏  没有身份  没有地址
<7-11,CASTLE>The guy's a John Doe. He's got no I.D., no address.

172
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,840
<7-11,CASTLE>可能是流浪汉  我们该从哪开始找
<7-11,CASTLE>Could be homeless. Where do we even start?

173
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,370
<7-12,BECKETT>我们要发一份全境通告  把他的信息发给
<7-12,BECKETT>We'll put out a B.O.L.O., get his info

174
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:13,260
<7-12,BECKETT>城里每家医院  每个分局  每家精神病院
<7-12,BECKETT>to every hospital, precinct, and psych ward in the city.

175
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:15,190
<7-13,ESPOSITO>我把他的照片发给庇护所
<7-13,ESPOSITO>I'll send out his pictures to shelters

176
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,810
<7-13,ESPOSITO>和施粥所  看看我们够不够走运
<7-13,ESPOSITO>and soup kitchens, see if we can get lucky.

177
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:17,880
<7-14,RYAN>我想我们走运了
<7-14,RYAN>I think we just did.

178
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,200
<7-14,RYAN>刚刚是我们的被害人的邻居
<7-14,RYAN>That was our victim's neighbor.

179
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:20,640
<7-14,RYAN>他刚刚看到我们要找的无名氏
<7-14,RYAN>He just saw our John Doe

180
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,090
<7-14,RYAN>闯进了萨娜的公寓
<7-14,RYAN>breaking back into Shauna's apartment.

181
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:36,250
<8-2,ESPOSITO>纽约警局  把手举起来
<8-2,ESPOSITO>N.Y.P.D.! Show us your hands right now!

182
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,100
<8-2,ESPOSITO>不
<8-2,ESPOSITO>No!

183
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,330
<8-3,SIMON>不  放开我  你们不知道自己在做什么
<8-3,SIMON>No, no, no! Let me go! You don't know what you're doing!

184
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,590
<8-4,BECKETT>我们很清楚自己在做什么
<8-4,BECKETT>We know exactly what we're doing.

185
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:45,700
<8-5,SIMON>请听我说  别这样  拜托
<8-5,SIMON>Please listen to me. Don't do this. Please.

186
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,670
<8-5,SIMON>你们得让我走
<8-5,SIMON>You have to let me go.

187
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:48,830
<8-5,SIMON>如果不让我走  有十亿人得死
<8-5,SIMON>If you don't, a billion people will die.

188
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,810
<8-6,ESPOSITO>-是嘛  他们要怎么死  -我不知道
<8-6,ESPOSITO>- Yeah? How they gonna die? - I don't know.

189
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:52,070
<8-7,SIMON>我只知道他们要死了
<8-7,SIMON>I only know that they do.

190
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,260
<8-8,ESPOSITO>是嘛  你怎么知道的
<8-8,ESPOSITO>Yeah? How's that?

191
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,960
<8-9,SIMON>因为  我来自未来
<8-9,SIMON>Because... i'm from the future.

192
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:02,810
<8-10,CASTLE>这成了我最喜欢的案子
<8-10,CASTLE>This just became my favorite case.

202
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,880
<9-1,CASTLE>那么...来自未来  对吧
<9-1,CASTLE>So... future, huh?

203
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,700
<9-2,SIMON>-是的  -好吧
<9-2,SIMON>- That's right. - Okay.

204
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:16,430
<9-3,BECKETT>我们从简单的开始吧
<9-3,BECKETT>So why don't we just start with something simple,

205
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,460
<9-3,BECKETT>比如你的名字
<9-3,BECKETT>like your name?

206
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,610
<9-4,SIMON>为什么每个人都想知道我的名字
<9-4,SIMON>Why does everybody wanna know my name?

207
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:20,040
<9-4,SIMON>谁在乎呢  名字无所谓
<9-4,SIMON>And who cares? It doesn't matter.

208
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:21,660
<9-5,BECKETT>-就当是为了我  -好吧
<9-5,BECKETT>- Humor me. - Fine.

209
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:25,130
<9-6,SIMON>你可以叫我  西蒙  西蒙·道尔
<9-6,SIMON>You can call me... Simon. Simon... Doyle.

210
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,790
<9-7,CASTLE>你到底是从哪年来的
<9-7,CASTLE>And what year are you from, exactly?

211
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:28,440
<9-8,SIMON>-2035年  -卡塞尔
<9-8,SIMON>- 2035. - Castle.

212
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,890
<9-10,CASTLE>别跟我说你不想知道
<9-10,CASTLE>Don't tell me you weren't wondering.

213
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:31,570
<9-11,BECKETT>不  我真正想知道的是
<9-11,BECKETT>No, what I was actually wondering was

214
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:33,970
<9-11,BECKETT>你在萨娜·泰勒的公寓里做什么
<9-11,BECKETT>what were you doing in Shauna Taylor's apartment?

215
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,630
<9-12,SIMON>跟你们一样  寻找杀她的凶手
<9-12,SIMON>Same thing you were, I expect. Looking for her killer.

216
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:40,210
<9-13,BECKETT>但所有的证据都指向你
<9-13,BECKETT>Except all the evidence points to you.

217
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:44,480
<9-14,SIMON>警探  防止她被杀是我的工作
<9-14,SIMON>Detective, it was my job to prevent her murder.

218
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,250
<9-14,SIMON>照此事实  证明完毕  我不是杀她的凶手
<9-14,SIMON>Ipso facto, Q.E.D., I am not her killer.

219
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:49,650
<9-14,SIMON>事实上  她根本就不应该死
<9-14,SIMON>Point, in fact, she was never even supposed to die.

220
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:50,810
<9-14,SIMON>好吗  但因为她死了
<9-14,SIMON>Okay? But because she has,

221
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,770
<9-14,SIMON>一连串的事件就开始了  如果我不阻止
<9-14,SIMON>a chain of events has started, that if I do not stop--

222
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:54,040
<9-15,CASTLE>数十亿人都要死吗
<9-15,CASTLE>Billions of people will die?

223
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,190
<9-16,SIMON>完全正确  听着...
<9-16,SIMON>That's exactly right. Look...

224
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:58,880
<9-17,SIMON>在2031年的能源战争之后
<9-17,SIMON>After the bloody energy wars of 2031,

225
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,780
<9-17,SIMON>我们终于发掘出了新型能源
<9-17,SIMON>we'd finally managed to cultivate new sources of power.

226
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,080
<9-18,CASTLE>能源战争
<9-18,CASTLE>Energy wars?

227
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:03,840
<9-19,SIMON>对  新法西斯分子崛起
<9-19,SIMON>Yeah, neo-fascists come to power,

228
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,450
<9-19,SIMON>想以几个人的力量控制整个世界的
<9-19,SIMON>try to control the world's energy supply

229
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:08,790
<9-19,SIMON>能源供应  不过别担心  我们打败他们了
<9-19,SIMON>for a select few, but don't worry. We defeat them.

230
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:11,150
<9-19,SIMON>结果其中一个能量来源是个
<9-19,SIMON>Turns out that one of these new sources of power

231
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,700
<9-19,SIMON>超光速粒子加速器  它...
<9-19,SIMON>is a tachyon generator. It...

232
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,750
<9-19,SIMON>为我们打开了时间流的大门
<9-19,SIMON>Lets us open doors in the time stream continuum,

233
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,520
<9-19,SIMON>让我们能够回到过去
<9-19,SIMON>allowing us to travel back in time.

234
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,620
<9-19,SIMON>但为了防止被滥用
<9-19,SIMON>But, of course, because of the possibility of abuse,

235
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,840
<9-19,SIMON>它被严格控制并不为公众所知
<9-19,SIMON>It was tightly regulated and kept secret from the public.

236
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,560
<9-20,BECKETT>我们有一个目击证人
<9-20,BECKETT>We have a witness that saw you

237
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,220
<9-20,BECKETT>看到你在萨娜·泰勒遇害不久后
<9-20,BECKETT>leaving Shauna Taylor's apartment

238
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:26,190
<9-20,BECKETT>离开她公寓
<9-20,BECKETT>shortly after she was killed.

239
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,980
<9-21,SIMON>我就要说到那儿了  我是个时间人类学家
<9-21,SIMON>I'm getting to that. Look. Look, I'm a temporal anthropologist.

240
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,220
<9-21,SIMON>我们的工作是回到过去
<9-21,SIMON>What we do is we travel back in time

241
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,620
<9-21,SIMON>然后我们研究具有文化意义的时代
<9-21,SIMON>and we--and we study culturally significant eras--

242
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:35,600
<9-21,SIMON>古埃及  中世纪  伙计  我去过纳粹德国
<9-21,SIMON>Ancient Egypt, Middle Ages. Man, I've been to Nazi Germany.

243
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,820
<9-22,CASTLE>你们不担心蝴蝶效应吗
<9-22,CASTLE>Aren't you worried about the butterfly effect?

244
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,430
<9-22,CASTLE>不小心改变了过去的某些东西
<9-22,CASTLE>Accidentally changing something in the past,

245
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:40,860
<9-22,CASTLE>以至于改变了未来
<9-22,CASTLE>thus altering the future?

246
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,060
<9-22,CASTLE>不  我们很小心
<9-22,CASTLE>No. We're careful.

247
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:45,170
<9-22,CASTLE>时间流基本是可以自我修正的
<9-22,CASTLE>The time stream is mostly self-correcting, okay?

248
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:46,450
<9-23,SIMON>那些小的变化就像是流速很快的
<9-23,SIMON>Any small change is like a little ripple

249
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:47,420
<9-23,SIMON>河流中的小波浪  对吧
<9-23,SIMON>in a fast-moving river, right?

250
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,570
<9-23,SIMON>很快就消失了  没关系的
<9-23,SIMON>It's gone in a second. Doesn't matter.

251
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:50,020
<9-23,SIMON>但如果有人要做什么大事
<9-23,SIMON>But if someone was to do something big,

252
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,830
<9-23,SIMON>如果有人要做非常大的事
<9-23,SIMON>if somebody was to do something massive,

253
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,860
<9-23,SIMON>那当然  你肯定是可以改变未来的
<9-23,SIMON>then, yes, of course, damn right you can change the future,

254
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:56,390
<9-23,SIMON>而且刚刚就发生了这样的事
<9-23,SIMON>and by the way, that's exactly what just happened.

255
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,250
<9-23,SIMON>有人闯进了我们的实验室
<9-23,SIMON>Somebody broke into our lab, okay?

256
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,580
<9-23,SIMON>未经允许就回到了过去  我们不知道是谁
<9-23,SIMON>Made an unauthorized jump back in time. We don't know who.

257
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:03,050
<9-23,SIMON>但他们这么做的时候  数字就会剧增
<9-23,SIMON>But when they did, the numbers-- they started to spike.

258
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:04,900
<9-23,SIMON>现在我就像是海啸来临前的潮水
<9-23,SIMON>Now I'm like a tide going out before a tsunami.

259
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,300
<9-24,CASTLE>那海啸真来的时候呢
<9-24,CASTLE>And what happens when the tsunami hits?

260
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,570
<9-25,SIMON>暂时还没赶上我们  不过等它真来了
<9-25,SIMON>Well, it hasn't caught up to us yet, okay, but when it does,

261
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:11,720
<9-25,SIMON>不管现在发生的事启动了什么事件链
<9-25,SIMON>Whatever chain of events that has just started now will result

262
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,360
<9-25,SIMON>都会导致数十亿人无辜丧命
<9-25,SIMON>In billions of deaths that did not otherwise occur.

263
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,260
<9-25,SIMON>明白我的意思吗
<9-25,SIMON>You understand me?

264
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:18,950
<9-26,BECKETT>好吧  道尔先生  就算你真的
<9-26,BECKETT>Okay. Um, Mr. Doyle, let's say that you are indeed

265
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:20,550
<9-26,BECKETT>来自未来
<9-26,BECKETT>from the future...

266
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,780
<9-26,BECKETT>萨娜·泰勒是怎么卷进这些事中的
<9-26,BECKETT>How did Shauna Taylor fit into all of this?

267
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:27,140
<9-26,BECKETT>为什么她的死能从根本上改变一切
<9-26,BECKETT>I mean, how does her death change things so radically?

268
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:30,480
<9-27,SIMON>我不知道  我只知道
<9-27,SIMON>I don't know. All I know is that

269
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,230
<9-27,SIMON>我们从时间线上第一个改变点追踪到了她的公寓
<9-27,SIMON>We traced the first change in the timeline to her apartment,

270
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:34,870
<9-27,SIMON>10月7日  上午12:58
<9-27,SIMON>October 7th, 12:58 a.m.

271
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:39,030
<9-28,CASTLE>所以他们才派你回来  所以你才会跟她搭讪
<9-28,CASTLE>Which is why they sent you back, why you accosted her...

272
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,420
<9-28,CASTLE>你是为了阻止连锁事件开始
<9-28,CASTLE>To stop that first event.

273
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,810
<9-29,SIMON>我失败了  好吧  现在她已经死了
<9-29,SIMON>And I failed, okay? And now she's dead.

274
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:45,930
<9-29,SIMON>可这也是我翻她公寓的原因
<9-29,SIMON>But this is why I was searching her apartment--

275
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:47,310
<9-29,SIMON>我是想找出她为什么被锁定为目标
<9-29,SIMON>To find out why she was targeted,

276
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:48,590
<9-29,SIMON>为什么这人要折磨她
<9-29,SIMON>Why this person would torture her.

277
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:50,690
<9-29,SIMON>他穿越时空回来找她一定有原因
<9-29,SIMON>There's a reason he came back in time to find her.

278
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,920
<9-29,SIMON>她有他要的东西
<9-29,SIMON>She had something he needed.

279
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,430
<9-29,SIMON>我不知道是什么  某些信息  无关紧要了
<9-29,SIMON>I don't know what. Some piece of information. Doesn't matter.

280
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,720
<9-29,SIMON>重要的是我得离开这里  明白吗
<9-29,SIMON>What matters is that I get out of here, okay?

281
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,080
<9-29,SIMON>现在还不晚
<9-29,SIMON>Because it is not too late.

282
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,410
<9-29,SIMON>我还是可以阻止一切
<9-29,SIMON>I can still stop this.

283
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,460
<9-30,SIMON>但你们得马上放我走  明白吗
<9-30,SIMON>But you have to let me go now, okay?

284
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,010
<9-30,SIMON>在他们召回我之前  我只有几小时时间了
<9-30,SIMON>I only have a few hours before they recall me.

285
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:06,140
<9-31,BECKETT>你就准备好延误吧
<9-31,BECKETT>You're gonna be delayed.

286
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:07,450
<9-32,SIMON>不是吧
<9-32,SIMON>Oh, no.

287
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:10,840
<9-33,CASTLE>召回你
<9-33,CASTLE>Recall you?

288
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,640
<9-34,SIMON>太痛苦了  我简直在跟原始人说话
<9-34,SIMON>This is painful. No, man. I'm talking to people

289
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,160
<9-34,SIMON>这些人甚至还以为地球是方的
<9-34,SIMON>who still think the earth is flat.

290
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,420
<9-36,ESPOSITO>他的指纹
<9-36,ESPOSITO>His fingerprints are a match

291
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,000
<9-36,ESPOSITO>跟我们从犯罪现场提取到的相吻合
<9-36,ESPOSITO>for the ones we pulled from the crime scene.

292
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:21,810
<9-36,ESPOSITO>毫无疑问  他就是凶手
<9-36,ESPOSITO>No question he's our guy.

293
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,960
<9-37,BECKETT>是的  毫无疑问
<9-37,BECKETT>Yeah. No kidding.

294
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,830
<10-1,SIMON>-你犯大错了  -卡塞尔
<10-1,SIMON>- You're making a huge mistake!  - Castle.

295
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:29,100
<10-3,CASTLE>-怎么  -考虑到咱俩的将来
<10-3,CASTLE>- Yeah?  - For the sake of our future,

296
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,140
<10-4,BECKETT>拜托你告诉我你不相信那家伙
<10-4,BECKETT>Please tell me you don't believe that guy.

297
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:34,430
<10-5,CASTLE>-我不信  但你得承认这是个好故事  -是吗
<10-5,CASTLE>- Oh, no. But you got to admit, it's a great story.  - Really?

298
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,660
<10-7,RYAN>我倒觉得这是盗版捏造的
<10-7,RYAN>Uh, thought it was kinda derivative.

299
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:40,000
<10-8,ESPOSITO>没错  像是《十二猴子》混搭《终结者》
<10-8,ESPOSITO>Yeah, like a mash-up of "12 monkeys" and "Terminator."

300
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,830
<10-9,CASTLE>是没错  可他讲故事的语气  相当投入啊
<10-9,CASTLE>Yeah, but it's the way he told it...total commitment.

301
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,740
<10-10,BECKETT>投入得都致命了
<10-10,BECKETT>Commitment that turned deadly.

302
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,500
<10-10,BECKETT>就为了维系他的想象
<10-10,BECKETT>I mean, to maintain his delusion,

303
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,300
<10-10,BECKETT>萨娜连命都丢了  他可能都不知道自己杀了她
<10-10,BECKETT>Shauna had to die. He might not even know that he killed her.

304
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,140
<10-11,CASTLE>你们查清道尔带的这设备
<10-11,CASTLE>Hey, did you guys find out what this device was

305
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,100
<10-11,CASTLE>是什么了吗
<10-11,CASTLE>Doyle had on him?

306
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,230
<10-12,RYAN>科技处说这就是把垃圾零件组装到了一起的破烂
<10-12,RYAN>Tech said it's just a bunch of junk thrown together.

307
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:56,450
<10-13,ESPOSITO>不然你以为是什么  卡塞尔
<10-13,ESPOSITO>What were you expecting, Castle?

308
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:59,250
<10-13,ESPOSITO>穿越时空的设备吗  神秘博士的音速起子吗
<10-13,ESPOSITO>Time travel device? Doctor Who's sonic screwdriver?

309
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,120
<10-14,CASTLE>你也看《神秘博士》啊
<10-14,CASTLE>You watch "Doctor Who"?

310
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,440
<10-15,BECKETT>是蕾妮  好了  我们去验尸房
<10-15,BECKETT>Oh, that's Lanie. Okay, we'll hit the morgue.

311
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,290
<10-15,BECKETT>你俩不如时空穿梭到自己的座位去吧
<10-15,BECKETT>Why don't you guys time travel over to your desks

312
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:08,410
<10-15,BECKETT>告诉地方检察官  我们抓到凶手了
<10-15,BECKETT>and let the D.A. Know that we've got our killer?

313
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:10,280
<11-1,LANIE>他不是凶手
<11-1,LANIE>He's not your killer.

314
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,140
<11-2,BECKETT>什么意思
<11-2,BECKETT>What do you mean?

315
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:16,050
<11-3,LANIE>意思是  死亡时间是午夜到凌晨两点之间
<11-3,LANIE>I mean time of death was between midnight and 2:00 a.M.

316
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:18,780
<11-3,LANIE>而道尔被精神病拘留到四点才被释放
<11-3,LANIE>Doyle wasn't released from psychiatric hold until 4:00 a.M.

317
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,380
<11-4,BECKETT>-不可能是他  -不  只能是他
<11-4,BECKETT>- It can't be him.  - No, it has to be him.

318
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:24,240
<11-4,BECKETT>他一直在跟踪她  而且他也在犯罪现场
<11-4,BECKETT>He was stalking her, and he was at the crime scene.

319
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,910
<11-5,LANIE>没错  是她死后几小时后才去的
<11-5,LANIE>Yeah... hours after she was dead.

320
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:29,650
<11-5,LANIE>说实话  死亡时间很可能是凌晨一点左右
<11-5,LANIE>In fact, time of death is probably closer to 1:00 a.m.

321
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,720
<11-6,CASTLE>-你怎么知道  -她的手表
<11-6,CASTLE>- How can you tell that?  - Her watch.

322
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,520
<11-7,LANIE>指针停在12:58
<11-7,LANIE>It stopped at 12:58,

323
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:35,180
<11-7,LANIE>很可能是其中一次电击造成的
<11-7,LANIE>Probably from one of the electric shocks.

324
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:37,330
<11-8,CASTLE>我能看看吗  12-58
<11-8,CASTLE>May I? 12:58.

325
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:38,450
<11-8,CASTLE>你起鸡皮疙瘩了吗
<11-8,CASTLE>Did you just get a chill?

326
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:40,820
<11-8,CASTLE>没有  卡塞尔  我没起鸡皮疙瘩
<11-8,CASTLE>No, Castle, I didn't just get a chill.

327
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:41,720
<11-8,CASTLE>想知道为什么吗
<11-8,CASTLE>Do you wanna know why?

328
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,070
<11-9,BECKETT>因为道尔就在犯罪现场
<11-9,BECKETT>Because Doyle was at that crime scene,

329
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:46,780
<11-9,BECKETT>他有大把时间去调她的手表
<11-9,BECKETT>And he had plenty of time to change her watch

330
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,370
<11-9,BECKETT>好跟他幻想出的故事相吻合
<11-9,BECKETT>to fit his delusional story.

331
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:51,350
<11-9,BECKETT>虽然她被杀时他不在现场
<11-9,BECKETT>And just because he wasn't there when she was being murdered,

332
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:53,480
<11-9,BECKETT>也不能说明他与这事完全没关系
<11-9,BECKETT>it doesn't mean he's not involved somehow.

333
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:54,820
<11-10,LANIE>还有
<11-10,LANIE>There's something else.

334
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:58,160
<11-10,LANIE>萨娜遇害当晚曾跟什么人在一起过
<11-10,LANIE>Shauna was with someone the night she was killed.

335
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,070
<11-10,LANIE>当我把尸体上的血迹清洗干净后
<11-10,LANIE>Once I cleaned the blood from the body,

336
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,270
<11-10,LANIE>我看到了这些
<11-10,LANIE>I saw these...

337
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,520
<11-10,LANIE>在她脖子上
<11-10,LANIE>on her neck.

338
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,230
<11-11,BECKETT>是唇膏吗
<11-11,BECKETT>Is that lipstick?

339
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:14,030
<11-13,CASTLE>跟她在一起的是个女人
<11-13,CASTLE>She was with a woman.

340
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:17,050
<12-1,BECKETT>伙计们  萨娜的继兄证实了
<12-1,BECKETT>You guys, Shauna's stepbrother confirms

341
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:20,430
<12-1,BECKETT>她是同性恋  但他确信她没有女友
<12-1,BECKETT>She was gay, but he's sure she wasn't seeing someone.

342
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,670
<12-2,RYAN>她的手机记录里
<12-2,RYAN>There's nothing in her phone records

343
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:22,770
<12-2,RYAN>看不出有哪个联系人是女友
<12-2,RYAN>that would indicate a girlfriend.

344
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:25,040
<12-2,RYAN>不过  我发现了她遇害当晚的
<12-2,RYAN>However, I did find a charge to her credit card

345
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:27,110
<12-2,RYAN>一笔信用卡账单
<12-2,RYAN>for the night that she died.

346
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:28,310
<12-2,RYAN>乔治娅酒吧
<12-2,RYAN>Georgia's Bar.

347
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:30,810
<12-3,ESPOSITO>就在她公寓楼下的转角附近
<12-3,ESPOSITO>It's right around the corner from her apartment.

348
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,040
<12-3,ESPOSITO>看起来她还给别人买了酒
<12-3,ESPOSITO>Looks like she was buying for two.

349
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:33,530
<12-4,BECKETT>可能是凶手
<12-4,BECKETT>Could be our killer.

350
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:34,730
<12-4,BECKETT>你俩过去看看
<12-4,BECKETT>Okay, you guys get over there,

351
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,130
<12-4,BECKETT>看有没有人看到她跟谁一起
<12-4,BECKETT>see if she was seen with anyone

352
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:37,880
<12-4,BECKETT>或者有没有人发现什么不寻常的地方
<12-4,BECKETT>or noticed anything out of the ordinary.

353
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,140
<12-4,BECKETT>我会打给地方检察官
<12-4,BECKETT>I will call the D.A.

354
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,410
<12-4,BECKETT>如果我们不能告道尔谋杀
<12-4,BECKETT>If we can't charge Doyle with murder...

355
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:44,610
<12-4,BECKETT>也许我可以给他申请精神病评估  暂时拘留他
<12-4,BECKETT>Maybe I can get him held with a departmental psych eval

356
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,020
<12-4,BECKETT>直到我们找出答案为止
<12-4,BECKETT>until we have some answers.

357
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:49,680
<13-1,BARTENDER>没错  萨娜来过
<13-1,BARTENDER>Yeah, Shauna was here.

358
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:51,560
<13-1,BARTENDER>怎么了  她出什么事了吗
<13-1,BARTENDER>Why? Did something happen to her?

359
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:53,690
<13-2,RYAN>那晚她有跟谁一起吗
<13-2,RYAN>Was she with anyone that night?

360
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,550
<13-3,BARTENDER>有  挺奇怪的
<13-3,BARTENDER>Yeah. It was odd.

361
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,290
<13-3,BARTENDER>跟她一起那女的是个鸡
<13-3,BARTENDER>The chick she was hanging with was a pro.

362
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,140
<13-4,ESPOSITO>-你是说妓女  -没错
<13-4,ESPOSITO>- You mean, like, a hooker?  - Yeah.

363
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,600
<13-5,BARTENDER>我周末的时候在斯坦迪什的酒吧当酒保
<13-5,BARTENDER>I bartend weekends down at the Standish.

364
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:02,500
<13-5,BARTENDER>那女的是那边贵宾厅的常客
<13-5,BARTENDER>Chick's a regular in their lounge

365
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,720
<13-5,BARTENDER>目标都是高消费人士
<13-5,BARTENDER>targeting upscale men.

366
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:05,490
<13-6,RYAN>你以前见过她来这里吗
<13-6,RYAN>You ever seen her down here before?

367
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,680
<13-7,BARTENDER>我不知道她在工作还是怎么的
<13-7,BARTENDER>I don't know if she was working or what,

368
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,270
<13-7,BARTENDER>反正她跟萨娜看起来打得火热
<13-7,BARTENDER>but she and Shauna seemed pretty cozy.

369
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:11,550
<13-7,BARTENDER>而且她们是一起走的
<13-7,BARTENDER>They left together.

370
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:13,920
<13-8,RYAN>你知道她的名字吗
<13-8,RYAN>You know her name?

371
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:16,450
<13-9,BARTENDER>维罗妮卡  去斯坦迪什查查吧
<13-9,BARTENDER>Veronica. Go up to the Standish.

372
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:17,740
<13-9,BARTENDER>没人不知道她
<13-9,BARTENDER>She'll be hard to miss.

373
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,850
<14-1,VERONICA>你们的证人弄错了
<14-1,VERONICA>Your witnesses are confused.

374
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:21,840
<14-1,VERONICA>我不去乔治娅那边  那可不够我的档次
<14-1,VERONICA>I don't go to Georgia's. Not my scene.

375
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:23,990
<14-2,BECKETT>我们有监控录像显示
<14-2,BECKETT>Well, we have security camera footage

376
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:26,070
<14-2,BECKETT>你们俩是一起离开那里的
<14-2,BECKETT>that shows the two of you leaving there together.

377
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:27,990
<14-3,RYAN>要不要换个说法
<14-3,RYAN>Wanna try again?

378
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:31,790
<14-4,VERONICA>好吧  我跟她离开了  想换个地方
<14-4,VERONICA>Okay. I left with her. I like a little variety.

379
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,160
<14-5,BECKETT>你离开酒吧之后发生了什么
<14-5,BECKETT>And what happened after you left the bar?

380
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,530
<14-6,VERONICA>-你去她家了吗  -这关你什么事
<14-6,VERONICA>- Did you go to her place? - How is that your business?

381
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,320
<14-6,VERONICA>因为...
<14-6,VERONICA>Because...

382
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,140
<14-7,BECKETT>她死了
<14-7,BECKETT>she's dead.

383
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:41,930
<14-7,BECKETT>昨晚在公寓里被杀
<14-7,BECKETT>Killed in her apartment last night.

384
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:43,770
<14-8,RYAN>她脖子上有口红印
<14-8,RYAN>We found lipstick marks on her neck.

385
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,370
<14-8,RYAN>你觉得我们检验之后  会发现谁的DNA呢
<14-8,RYAN>When we test 'em, whose D.N.A. do you think we're gonna find?

386
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,820
<14-9,VERONICA>不是我干的
<14-9,VERONICA>This wasn't me. I didn't do this.

387
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:50,060
<14-10,BECKETT>可是那晚你跟她在一起
<14-10,BECKETT>You were with her that night.

388
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,540
<14-11,VERONICA>只是因为有人付我钱
<14-11,VERONICA>But only because I was paid to be.

389
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:54,220
<14-12,BECKETT>-谁  -有个男人花钱雇我跟她搭讪
<14-12,BECKETT>- By who? - Some guy. He hired me to come on to her.

390
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:57,210
<14-14,RYAN>-为什么  -他要我去她家  偷她的钥匙
<14-14,RYAN>- Why? - He wanted me to get in her place and steal her keys.

391
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:59,330
<14-15,VERONICA>我不知道他会杀她
<14-15,VERONICA>I-I didn't know he was gonna kill her.

392
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,130
<14-16,BECKETT>是这个人吗
<14-16,BECKETT>Is this the guy?

393
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:05,030
<14-17,VERONICA>不  那个人很凶  很可怕
<14-17,VERONICA>No. This guy was way more intense, scary.

394
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:07,440
<14-18,BECKETT>-他是谁  -我不知道  我也不想知道
<14-18,BECKETT>- Who is he? - I don't know. I didn't want to know.

395
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,880
<14-19,VERONICA>我做了该做的  就离开了那里
<14-19,VERONICA>I just did what I had to and I got out of there.

396
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,940
<14-20,RYAN>如果你不认识他  为什么要同意这样做
<14-20,RYAN>If you didn't know him, why'd you agree to take the job?

397
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:14,030
<14-21,VERONICA>我别无选择  我的老板米克说我必须这样做
<14-21,VERONICA>Because I had no choice. Mick, my manager, said I had to.

398
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:16,420
<14-21,VERONICA>他说这个男人是他的朋友
<14-21,VERONICA>He said this guy was a friend of his.

399
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:20,040
<15-1,CASTLE>如果想找到这个可怕的男人
<15-1,CASTLE>So if we are gonna find the scary guy,

401
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,670
<15-1,CASTLE>难道不应该去找这位老板吗
<15-1,CASTLE>shouldn't we be tracking down this manager?

402
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:24,650
<15-2,RYAN>没必要  我们让维罗妮卡给他打电话
<15-2,RYAN>Don't have to. We had Veronica call him

403
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,750
<15-2,RYAN>说她接活被被抓了
<15-2,RYAN>and tell him she's been busted for solicitation.

404
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,920
<15-2,RYAN>他以为来警局是为保释她
<15-2,RYAN>He thinks he's coming in to bail her out.

405
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,930
<15-3,BECKETT>所以  那位时空穿梭者如何了
<15-3,BECKETT>So... how's our time traveler?

406
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,290
<15-4,ESPOSITO>他还是那套说法
<15-4,ESPOSITO>Well, he's still sticking to his story.

407
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:34,570
<15-4,ESPOSITO>一直在看手表  说马上要被召回了
<15-4,ESPOSITO>Keeps checking his watch, saying he's about to be recalled.

408
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:36,130
<15-5,CASTLE>不过这事也不算浪费
<15-5,CASTLE>Hmm. Well, it's not a total waste.

409
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:37,560
<15-5,CASTLE>我可是获得了第一手股票信息
<15-5,CASTLE>I did get some excellent stock tips.

410
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,660
<15-6,BECKETT>先别急着投资
<15-6,BECKETT>Well, don't invest just yet.

411
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,530
<15-6,BECKETT>只要搞清楚维罗妮卡的老板是谁
<15-6,BECKETT>Once we find out who hired Veronica,

412
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:43,770
<15-6,BECKETT>就知道道尔在其中扮演的角色了
<15-6,BECKETT>then we'll know how Doyle's involved.

413
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:46,070
<15-6,BECKETT>贝克特探长  我是谢夫曼医生
<15-6,BECKETT>Detective Beckett? Dr. Silverman,

414
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,660
<15-6,BECKETT>来做西蒙·道尔的精神评估
<15-6,BECKETT>here for psych eval on Simon Doyle.

415
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:50,550
<16-1,BECKETT>他就在里面
<16-1,BECKETT>He's right back there.

416
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,030
<16-2,SILVERMAN>在哪里
<16-2,SILVERMAN>Right back where?

417
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,510
<16-3,BECKETT>他在哪
<16-3,BECKETT>Where is he?

418
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:08,870
<16-3,BECKETT>他去什么地方了
<16-3,BECKETT>Where did he go?

419
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,110
<16-4,CASTLE>不是地方
<16-4,CASTLE>Not where.

420
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,220
<16-4,CASTLE>是什么时间
<16-4,CASTLE>When.

421
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:19,050
<17-1,CASTLE>我就是说  如果他说的是实话
<17-1,CASTLE>I'm just saying, what if he was telling the truth

422
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:20,570
<17-1,CASTLE>也许他确实被召回到未来了
<17-1,CASTLE>and he really was recalled back to the future?

423
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:23,050
<17-1,CASTLE>他不可能被召回到未来
<17-1,CASTLE>He wasn't recalled back to the future.

424
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,970
<17-2,BECKETT>你知道我怎么知道的吗
<17-2,BECKETT>And do you know how I know that?

425
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,580
<17-2,BECKETT>因为他不是时空穿梭者
<17-2,BECKETT>Because he's not a time traveler.

426
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:30,010
<17-3,CASTLE>好吧  那他在哪里
<17-3,CASTLE>Okay. So where is he?

427
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:31,630
<17-3,CASTLE>简单地说
<17-3,CASTLE>Simple explanation?

428
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:33,620
<17-4,BECKETT>取消对他的指控时
<17-4,BECKETT>There was a mix-up with the paperwork

429
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,190
<17-4,BECKETT>文件出了小错误
<17-4,BECKETT>when his charges were dropped,

430
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,380
<17-4,BECKETT>某个工作人员不小心放他走了
<17-4,BECKETT>and some desk monkey accidentally let him go,

431
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,960
<17-4,BECKETT>现在这个人正在试图掩盖自己的错误
<17-4,BECKETT>and now they are all trying to cover their asses.

432
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:41,040
<17-5,CASTLE>这解释很合理
<17-5,CASTLE>That's reasonable.

433
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,050
<17-5,CASTLE>虽然不太可能  但是很合理
<17-5,CASTLE>It's unlikely, but it's reasonable.

434
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:46,110
<17-6,ESPOSITO>道尔找得怎么样了
<17-6,ESPOSITO>Oh. Any luck finding Doyle?

435
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,110
<17-7,BECKETT>还没找到
<17-7,BECKETT>No. Not yet. Hmm.

436
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,700
<17-8,ESPOSITO>那是维罗妮卡的老板吗
<17-8,ESPOSITO>Is that Veronica's manager?

437
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,920
<17-9,ESPOSITO>对  米克·林登  刚来
<17-9,ESPOSITO>Yeah. Mick Linden. Just came in.

438
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:54,580
<17-9,ESPOSITO>我们打算让他见识我们的厉害
<17-9,ESPOSITO>We're about to lower the boom.

439
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:55,640
<17-10,BECKETT>需要帮忙吗
<17-10,BECKETT>You need a hand?

440
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:58,060
<17-11,ESPOSITO>不用  我们搞得定
<17-11,ESPOSITO>Nah. We got it.

441
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,140
<17-11,ESPOSITO>我们可不想让你把他也弄丢了
<17-11,ESPOSITO>Wouldn't want you to lose him, too.

442
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:07,960
<18-1,RYAN>给你讲一下情况  米克
<18-1,RYAN>Here's your situation, Mick.

443
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,220
<18-1,RYAN>维罗妮卡声称
<18-1,RYAN>Your girl Veronica says she stole

444
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,850
<18-1,RYAN>她为了你朋友 偷了被害人的钥匙
<18-1,RYAN>the victim's keys for a friend of yours.

445
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:13,180
<18-1,RYAN>这样你成了从犯
<18-1,RYAN>That makes you an accessory.

446
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,630
<18-2,MICK LYNDEN>天呐  我发誓...
<18-2,MICK LYNDEN>Oh, man, I swear to god--

447
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:16,040
<18-2,MICK LYNDEN>我不知道他会这样做
<18-2,MICK LYNDEN>I-I didn't know he was gonna do this.

448
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,380
<18-3,ESPOSITO>你觉得陪审团会相信你的说辞吗
<18-3,ESPOSITO>Yeah, well, good luck getting a jury to buy that.

449
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,350
<18-3,ESPOSITO>林登先生  这罪名可不小
<18-3,ESPOSITO>You're looking at a lot of time, Mr. Linden.

450
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,460
<18-4,LYNDEN>别这样  我六个月前刚放出来
<18-4,LYNDEN>Come on, man. Hey, man, I just got out six months ago.

451
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,270
<18-5,RYAN>不如这样吧  你告诉我们
<18-5,RYAN>I'll tell you what. You tell us everything

452

<18-5,RYAN>你那个谋杀犯朋友是谁
<18-5,RYAN>about that murderous friend of yours,

453
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:29,530
<18-5,RYAN>我们就告诉地方检察院  你协助了调查
<18-5,RYAN>and we'll tell the D.A. what a swell guy you are.

454
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:33,520
<18-6,LYNDEN>他姓沃德  加瑞特·沃德
<18-6,LYNDEN>His name's Ward. Garrett Ward.

455
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,030
<18-6,LYNDEN>在五点监狱是我的狱友
<18-6,LYNDEN>Oh, my god. He was my cellie at Five Points.

00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,170
<18-7,RYAN>哪里可以找到他
<18-7,RYAN>Where can we find him?

457
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:40,200
<18-8,LYNDEN>我不知道  上周是他找的我
<18-8,LYNDEN>I don't know, man. He found me last week.

458
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:42,350
<18-8,LYNDEN>说他刚放出来  需要我帮忙
<18-8,LYNDEN>Said he'd just gotten out, he needed a favor.

459
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:45,630
<18-8,LYNDEN>我觉得帮他总比跟他结仇好
<18-8,LYNDEN>I figured it was better to do it than end up on his hate list.

460
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,390
<18-9,ESPOSITO>你害怕他
<18-9,ESPOSITO>You're afraid of him.

461
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,820
<18-10,LYNDEN>废话  大家都怕他
<18-10,LYNDEN>Hell, yeah. Everyone was.

462
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:51,850
<18-10,LYNDEN>这人入狱一周
<18-10,LYNDEN>I mean, this guy was inside a week,

463
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:53,190
<18-10,LYNDEN>就混成了监狱老大
<18-10,LYNDEN>he was running the cell block.

464
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,710
<18-10,LYNDEN>残忍无比
<18-10,LYNDEN>Guy is ice-cold.

465
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,090
<18-11,RYAN>你还知道他什么事
<18-11,RYAN>What else do you know about him?

466
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:57,230
<18-12,LYNDEN>不知道
<18-12,LYNDEN>Nothing, man.

467
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:59,430
<18-12,LYNDEN>虽然我跟他一起住了好几年
<18-12,LYNDEN>And I shared air with this guy for years.

468
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:02,670
<18-12,LYNDEN>从来没谈过他的家人
<18-12,LYNDEN>Never once did he talk about his family,

469
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,130
<18-12,LYNDEN>没谈过家乡  女人
<18-12,LYNDEN>His hometown, his girl.

470
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:07,840
<18-12,LYNDEN>他可能当过兵
<18-12,LYNDEN>But he might have been a soldier.

471
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:09,470
<18-13,ESPOSITO>怎么这么说
<18-13,ESPOSITO>Yeah, why's that?

472
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:11,790
<18-14,LYNDEN>因为他有军人的不安全感
<18-14,LYNDEN>'Cause he had that way. Haunted.

473
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:13,520
<18-14,LYNDEN>老是在做俯卧撑  随时保持警戒
<18-14,LYNDEN>Always doing push-ups. Always on alert.

474
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:16,180
<18-15,ESPOSITO>你知道他为何要对萨娜·泰勒下杀手吗
<18-15,ESPOSITO>You know any reason why he'd target Shauna Taylor?

475
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:17,710
<18-16,LYNDEN>他根本没提过这个名字
<18-16,LYNDEN>He never even mentioned the name.

476
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:20,960
<18-16,LYNDEN>而且  你也说过  她不是他的假释官
<18-16,LYNDEN>And... you said before, she wasn't his parole officer,

477
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,440
<18-16,LYNDEN>所以我真不知道
<18-16,LYNDEN>so I have no idea.

478
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,240
<18-17,RYAN>也许他是为了帮朋友报仇
<18-17,RYAN>Could he have taken her out as a favor to a friend?

479
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:27,220
<18-18,LYNDEN>他根本没有朋友
<18-18,LYNDEN>That guy didn't have friends.

480
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,440
<18-18,LYNDEN>不过...
<18-18,LYNDEN>But, uh...

481
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:33,260
<18-18,LYNDEN>他有时会提到他的任务
<18-18,LYNDEN>like, sometimes he'd talk about his mission.

482
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,630
<18-19,ESPOSITO>什么任务
<18-19,ESPOSITO>What mission?

483
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:38,130
<18-20,LYNDEN>他只是说有未完成的任务
<18-20,LYNDEN>All he'd say is he had unfinished business,

484
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:39,830
<18-20,LYNDEN>说那会改变一切
<18-20,LYNDEN>and it would change everything.

485
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,610
<19-1,RYAN>加瑞特·沃德  六年前
<19-1,RYAN>Garrett Ward. Till six years ago,

486
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:49,300
<19-1,RYAN>没有犯罪记录
<19-1,RYAN>no criminal record.

487
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:51,310
<19-1,RYAN>事实上  六年前  他什么记录都没有
<19-1,RYAN>In fact, until six years ago, no record at all.

488
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,960
<19-1,RYAN>车管所  军队  哪里都没记录
<19-1,RYAN>No D.M.V., no military, nothing.

489
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,160
<19-2,BECKETT>怎么可能
<19-2,BECKETT>That's impossible.

490
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:56,190
<19-3,CASTLE>除非他是道尔所说的
<19-3,CASTLE>Unless he's the other time traveler

491
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,320
<19-3,CASTLE>另一名时空穿梭者
<19-3,CASTLE>that Doyle was talking about.

492
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,920
<19-4,RYAN>不管他是谁  他的记录始于
<19-4,RYAN>Whoever he is, his record begins

493
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,010
<19-4,RYAN>曼哈顿的一次国际能源会议
<19-4,RYAN>when he was arrested for bringing a backpack bomb

494
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:03,640
<19-4,RYAN>他因背包里携带了炸弹而被捕
<19-4,RYAN>into a Global Energy Conference here in Manhattan.

495
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,300
<19-5,BECKETT>-什么动机  -当时
<19-5,BECKETT>- And what was his motive? - Well, at the time,

496
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,430
<19-6,ESPOSITO>当地政府称他与一个激进环保组织有关
<19-6,ESPOSITO>the authorities linked him to a radical eco group

497
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:08,780
<19-6,ESPOSITO>他们一直在抗议这场会议
<19-6,ESPOSITO>that was protesting the conference.

498
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:09,800
<19-7,RYAN>这份文件显示
<19-7,RYAN>According to his file,

499
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,380
<19-7,RYAN>他似乎是个反科学研究的疯子
<19-7,RYAN>he's some kind of anti-science nut job.

500
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,450
<19-7,RYAN>他们在他身上发现许多炸弹客风格的笔记
<19-7,RYAN>They found lots of unabomber-style notebooks on him

501
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:16,100
<19-7,RYAN>谴责"用科学和技术毁灭
<19-7,RYAN>Decrying "The destruction of the rightful kingdom of god

502
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,560
<19-7,RYAN>上帝之国"
<19-7,RYAN>by science and technology."

503
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,220
<19-8,BECKETT>-他和道尔有什么联系吗  -没有
<19-8,BECKETT>- What's his connection to Doyle? - Nada.

504
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:23,310
<19-9,ESPOSITO>怎么会没有  拜托伙计们  很明显好不好
<19-9,ESPOSITO>What do you mean, nada? Guys, come on, it's so obvious!

505
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:25,080
<19-10,CASTLE>你们看  沃德就是道尔
<19-10,CASTLE>Look. Ward is the guy that Doyle

506
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,970
<19-10,CASTLE>被派回来阻止的那个人
<19-10,CASTLE>was sent back in time to stop, okay?

507
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:30,220
<19-10,CASTLE>沃德被送回
<19-10,CASTLE>Ward was sent back in time

508
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,420
<19-10,CASTLE>完成某项改变历史的任务
<19-10,CASTLE>on some history-altering mission

509
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,710
<19-10,CASTLE>他任务失败  结果进了监狱
<19-10,CASTLE>That he failed to accomplish, ending up in prison.

510
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:37,650
<19-10,CASTLE>六年之后  他试图完成任务
<19-10,CASTLE>Six years later, he's trying to complete that mission,

511
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:40,020
<19-10,CASTLE>所以道尔被送回到现今
<19-10,CASTLE>Which is why Doyle has been sent back to now,

512
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:43,170
<19-10,CASTLE>因为现今时间线发生了改变
<19-10,CASTLE>Because now is when the timeline changed.

513
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,270
<19-11,BECKETT>我在想也许
<19-11,BECKETT>Well, I was thinking that maybe

514
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:48,470
<19-11,BECKETT>沃德和道尔在一个正常的世界认识对方
<19-11,BECKETT>Ward and Doyle knew each other in the non-crazy world,

515
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:51,670
<19-11,BECKETT>比如那个据称沃德是其中一员的环保组织
<19-11,BECKETT>like perhaps that eco group that Ward was supposedly a part of.

516
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:53,990
<19-12,CASTLE>好吧  真没趣
<19-12,CASTLE>Okay. Not as fun.

517
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:57,110
<19-13,BECKETT>但为什么一个反科学的狂热份子
<19-13,BECKETT>But why would an anti-science nut

518
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,760
<19-13,BECKETT>折磨并谋杀一位假释官呢
<19-13,BECKETT>torture and murder a parole officer?

519
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,600
<19-13,BECKETT>她和这些事情有什么联系
<19-13,BECKETT>I mean, what's her connection to any of this?

520
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,730
<19-14,RYAN>我们还没找到
<19-14,RYAN>We still haven't found one.

521
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:05,020
<19-15,BECKETT>你俩"回到过去"
<19-15,BECKETT>Why don't you guys go back in time

522
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,180
<19-15,BECKETT>看看能不能找到
<19-15,BECKETT>and see if you can dig up

523
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,670
<19-15,BECKETT>六年前沃德的已知合伙人
<19-15,BECKETT>any of Ward's known associates from six years ago?

524
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:10,910
<19-15,BECKETT>卡塞尔和我去研究他的案件记录
<19-15,BECKETT>Castle and I will look into his case record,

525
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:13,610
<19-15,BECKETT>看能不能找到他和萨娜·泰勒之间的联系
<19-15,BECKETT>See if we can find a connection between him and Shauna Taylor

526
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:17,040
<19-15,BECKETT>或是弄清楚他未完成的任务是什么
<19-15,BECKETT>or perhaps figure out what his unfinished business was.

527
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:24,000
<20-1,CASTLE>不  阿莱克西斯  我当然相信你
<20-1,CASTLE>No, Alexis, I do trust you.

528
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,700
<20-1,CASTLE>我是说  和一个在香蕉种植园
<20-1,CASTLE>I'm just saying, deciding to share an apartment

529
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,720
<20-1,CASTLE>认识才一个月的人同居
<20-1,CASTLE>with someone you met on a banana plantation a month ago

530
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:34,380
<20-1,CASTLE>不像是你做出的最明智的决定
<20-1,CASTLE>just doesn't strike me as the smartest decision you've ever made.

531
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,570
<20-2,CASTLE>阿莱克西斯  你--
<20-2,CASTLE>Alexis, you--

532
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:38,660
<20-2,CASTLE>阿莱克西斯--
<20-2,CASTLE>Alexis--

533
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,080
<20-3,CASTLE>她挂我电话
<20-3,CASTLE>She hung up on me.

534
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,210
<20-3,CASTLE>也许我不该提香蕉这茬
<20-3,CASTLE>Maybe I shouldn't have said that stuff about the bananas.

535
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,370
<20-3,CASTLE>你知道吗  卡塞尔
<20-3,CASTLE>You know, Castle,

536
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:58,250
<20-4,BECKETT>也许这对她来说是好事
<20-4,BECKETT>maybe this is a good thing for her.

537
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:01,270
<20-4,BECKETT>我是说  她看到我们在一起
<20-4,BECKETT>I mean, she sees us,

538
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:03,520
<20-4,BECKETT>她看到你开始了新的生活
<20-4,BECKETT>and she sees you starting something new.

539
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,130
<20-4,BECKETT>也许她是在努力弄明白怎么去适应
<20-4,BECKETT>Maybe she's just trying to figure out how she fits in.

540
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,570
<20-5,CASTLE>你是说这一切是因为我们
<20-5,CASTLE>You're saying this is about us?

541
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:12,130
<20-6,BECKETT>不是  我是说这是关于她自己
<20-6,BECKETT>No. Um, I'm saying this is about her.

542
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:14,530
<20-6,BECKETT>这是关于她的成长
<20-6,BECKETT>It's--it's about her growing up.

543
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,320
<20-7,CASTLE>如果我有台时光机你知道我会做什么吗
<20-7,CASTLE>You know what I'd do if I had a time machine?

544
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,870
<20-8,BECKETT>我会回去...
<20-8,BECKETT>I'd go back to...

545
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,180
<20-9,CASTLE>再次经历那些瞬间
<20-9,CASTLE>relive all those moments.

546
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,940
<20-9,CASTLE>牵着她的小手
<20-9,CASTLE>You know, holding her tiny hand,

547
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:27,250
<20-9,CASTLE>让她骑在我的肩膀上
<20-9,CASTLE>putting her up on my shoulders.

548
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,310
<20-9,CASTLE>我只是
<20-9,CASTLE>Just...

549
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,360
<20-9,CASTLE>我不敢相信那些时光一去不复返了
<20-9,CASTLE>I can't believe those times are gone.

550
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,330
<20-10,BECKETT>我知道  卡塞尔  但你也要想想
<20-10,BECKETT>I know, Castle, but think about

551
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:35,990
<20-10,BECKETT>你所憧憬的那些美好时光
<20-10,BECKETT>all of the great times that you have to look forward to

552
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:38,720
<20-10,BECKETT>关于她的未来还有我们的
<20-10,BECKETT>in her future a-and in ours.

553
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,140
<20-11,CASTLE>是啊  假设有未来的话
<20-11,CASTLE>Yeah, assuming there is a future.

554
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,890
<20-11,CASTLE>如果道尔是对的  也许未来根本不存在
<20-11,CASTLE>If Doyle's right, there may not even be one.

555
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:45,030
<20-12,BECKETT>拜托  卡塞尔
<20-12,BECKETT>Oh, come on, castle.

556
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:49,570
<20-13,CASTLE>看看这个
<20-13,CASTLE>Look at this.

557
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,160
<20-13,CASTLE>是一篇关于试图引爆炸弹的文章
<20-13,CASTLE>It's an article on the attempted bombing.

558
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,280
<20-13,CASTLE>看看图片
<20-13,CASTLE>Look at the picture.

559
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:58,070
<20-14,BECKETT>那是马尔科姆·威克福德  萨娜的继兄
<20-14,BECKETT>That's Malcolm Wickfield, Shauna's stepbrother.

560
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,530
<20-14,BECKETT>他当时在会议上
<20-14,BECKETT>He was at the conference?

561
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:01,140
<20-15,CASTLE>他不仅在会议上
<20-15,CASTLE>He wasn't just at the conference.

562
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,710
<20-15,CASTLE>他是发言人之一
<20-15,CASTLE>He was one of the speakers.

563
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:05,900
<20-15,CASTLE>威克福德的地址是未公开的
<20-15,CASTLE>Wickfield's address was unlisted.

564
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,130
<20-15,CASTLE>你得从警局才拿得到
<20-15,CASTLE>You had to get it from central.

565
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:09,430
<20-16,BECKETT>这就是沃德想从萨娜口中得到的东西
<20-16,BECKETT>That's what Ward wanted from Shauna?

566
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,190
<20-16,BECKETT>为了找到她的继兄吗
<20-16,BECKETT>To find her stepbrother?

567
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:13,200
<20-17,BECKETT>他要去杀威克福德
<20-17,BECKETT>He's going after Wickfield.

568
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,730
<21-1,BECKETT>纽约警察局  凶杀组的
<21-1,BECKETT>N.Y.P.D. Homicide.

569
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:25,570
<21-2,CASTLE>发生什么事了
<21-2,CASTLE>What happened?

570
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:26,950
<21-3,UNIFORM>他妻子说有人出现在门口
<21-3,UNIFORM>Wife said some guy just showed up at the door

571
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:27,940
<21-3,UNIFORM>袭击了他
<21-3,UNIFORM>and attacked him.

572
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,810
<21-3,UNIFORM>把他往死里打然后拧断了他的脖子
<21-3,UNIFORM>He beat the hell out of him then broke his neck.

573
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,780
<21-3,UNIFORM>没错  就是他
<21-3,UNIFORM>Yes. That's him.

574
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:42,840
<22-1,BECKETT>怎么回事
<22-1,BECKETT>So what happened?

575
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:47,060
<22-1,BECKETT>我们当时一起玩填字游戏
<22-1,BECKETT>We were, uh, doing a crossword puzzle together,

576
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:49,250
<21-1,BECKETT>然后  门铃响了
<21-1,BECKETT>and... the doorbell rang,

577
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:52,630
<21-2,CASTLE>之后马尔科姆去开门  那人  就
<21-2,CASTLE>And when Malcolm answered it, that man, he--

578
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,270
<21-3,UNIFORM>抓住他的脖子
<21-3,UNIFORM>He grabbed him by the neck

579
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:55,520
<21-3,UNIFORM>然后硬拉着他进了客厅
<21-3,UNIFORM>and he dragged him into the living room

580
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,030
<21-3,UNIFORM>然后他不停喊"那个孩子在哪
<21-3,UNIFORM>and he--he kept yelling, "Where's the child?

581
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:01,200
<22-1,BECKETT>怎么找到那个孩子"
<22-1,BECKETT>H-how can I find the child?"

582
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,990
<22-2,CASTLE>-什么孩子  -我们不知道
<22-2,CASTLE>- What child? - We didn't know.

583
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:06,570
<22-2,CASTLE>我们告诉他我们不知道  我们没有孩子
<22-2,CASTLE>We told him we didn't know. We don't have any children.

584
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,600
<22-2,CASTLE>我打电话报警  当他听到警笛声
<22-2,CASTLE>I called 9-1-1, and when he heard the sirens,

585
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,580
<22-3,CASTLE>他就...他就杀了马尔科姆
<22-3,CASTLE>That's when he... he killed Malcolm.

586
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,990
<22-3,CASTLE>警察进来之前他已经逃跑了
<22-3,CASTLE>He--he ran out before they arrived.

587
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:18,580
<22-3,CASTLE>威克福德夫人  你丈夫到底是从事什么工作
<22-3,CASTLE>Mrs. Wickfield, what exactly did your husband do?

588
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,340
<22-3,CASTLE>他是个理论物理学家
<22-3,CASTLE>He was a theoretical physicist.

589
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:24,820
<22-3,CASTLE>他试图去隔离新能源
<22-3,CASTLE>He was trying to isolate new energy sources.

590
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,640
<25-1,HASTING>为什么有人会把他作为目标呢
<25-1,HASTING>Why would anyone target him for that?

591
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,250
<25-2,CASTLE>因为有人认为他的
<25-2,CASTLE>Because some people thought that his--

592
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:29,680
<25-3,BECKETT>他的实验很危险
<25-3,BECKETT>His experiments were dangerous,

593
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,650
<25-4,HASTING>认为他会...制造一个黑洞
<25-4,HASTING>That somehow he was gonna... create a black hole

594
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,850
<25-4,HASTING>那会吞没整个地球
<25-4,HASTING>That was gonna swallow the earth.

595
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:37,380
<25-4,HASTING>当然  这些都是胡扯
<25-4,HASTING>Of course, it was-- it was all nonsense.

596
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,970
<23-1,WICKFIELD>这项研究非常令人兴奋
<23-1,WICKFIELD>Well, the work is very exciting.

597
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:44,620
<23-1,WICKFIELD>但是目前  都只是理论上的
<23-1,WICKFIELD>But right now it's all theoretical.

598
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:46,810
<23-1,WICKFIELD>我们的研究呈现的
<23-1,WICKFIELD>What our research really offers

599
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:50,000
<23-1,WICKFIELD>是一个了解宇宙的全新方式
<23-1,WICKFIELD>is an entirely new way of looking at the universe.

600
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:52,140
<23-2,CASTLE>改变人们了解宇宙的方法
<23-2,CASTLE>Changing the way people see the universe?

601
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,220
<23-2,CASTLE>他这种人要是死了
<23-2,CASTLE>That's exactly the kind of person

602
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:56,020
<23-2,CASTLE>绝对能改变未来
<23-2,CASTLE>whose death could alter the future.

603
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:58,760
<23-3,BECKETT>他这种人也刚好是沃德这种疯狂反科学主义者
<23-3,BECKETT>It's also the kind of person that a crazy anti-science nut

604
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,630
<23-3,BECKETT>会纠结的对象
<23-3,BECKETT>like Ward would fixate on.

605
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,350
<23-4,RYAN>也就是说会议上的
<23-4,RYAN>Which means any of the other speakers

606
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:03,860
<23-4,RYAN>其他发言人有可能是下一个目标
<23-4,RYAN>at that conference could be next.

607
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,650
<23-5,CASTLE>只不过他现在在找一个孩子
<23-5,CASTLE>Except now he's looking for a child.

608
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:07,430
<23-6,BECKETT>和会议主办方联系
<23-6,BECKETT>Okay, contact the conference organizers.

609
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:09,050
<23-6,BECKETT>拿到出席的所有人的名字
<23-6,BECKETT>Get names of everyone that attended.

610
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:11,290
<23-6,BECKETT>看看名单里有没有孩子
<23-6,BECKETT>Let's see if there are any children on that list.

611
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:12,640
<23-6,BECKETT>这家伙会再杀人的
<23-6,BECKETT>This guy's gonna kill again,

612
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,270
<23-6,BECKETT>而我们对他一无所知
<23-6,BECKETT>and we don't know anything about him.

613
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,680
<23-7,ESPOSITO>我发现了了解他的人
<23-7,ESPOSITO>I may have found someone who does.

614
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:19,380
<23-7,ESPOSITO>那个据称与沃德有联系的环保组织
<23-7,ESPOSITO>That eco group that Ward was supposedly a part of?

615
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:21,230
<23-7,ESPOSITO>之后组织解散了  但那时的领导者
<23-7,ESPOSITO>Well, it's since disbanded, but its leader at the time

616
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:23,470
<23-7,ESPOSITO>是一个叫杰克·哈斯汀的家伙
<23-7,ESPOSITO>was a guy named Jack Hastings.

617
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,210
<23-7,ESPOSITO>他现在是一个环境方面的著作者
<23-7,ESPOSITO>He's an environmental author now,

618
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:27,180
<23-7,ESPOSITO>而他的新书叫《地球尽头》
<23-7,ESPOSITO>and his new book, "Our Earth's End,"

619
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:28,710
<23-7,ESPOSITO>是关于即将到来的生态灾害
<23-7,ESPOSITO>It's about the coming eco disasters

620
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:30,600
<23-7,ESPOSITO>以及人类的毁灭
<23-7,ESPOSITO>and the destruction of the human race.

621
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:34,300
<24-1,JACK HASTING>如果你想获知未来
<24-1,JACK HASTING>If you want to know the future,

622
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,470
<24-1,JACK HASTING>来看看这些事实
<24-1,JACK HASTING>look at the facts.

623
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:38,670
<24-1,JACK HASTING>在不到35年内  石油
<24-1,JACK HASTING>In less than 35 years, we'll have no gas,

624
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:41,380
<24-1,JACK HASTING>煤和铀燃料将消耗殆尽
<24-1,JACK HASTING>no coal, and no uranium left.

625
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:44,230
<24-1,JACK HASTING>随着能源减少  和全球变暖引起的
<24-1,JACK HASTING>As our energy resources dwindle and needs rise

626
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:45,790
<24-1,JACK HASTING>需求上升
<24-1,JACK HASTING>due to global warming,

627
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:48,160
<24-1,JACK HASTING>资源稀缺将不可避免地引发
<24-1,JACK HASTING>scarcity will spark the inevitable--

628
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,280
<24-1,JACK HASTING>一场血腥的世界大战
<24-1,JACK HASTING>a massive, bloody world war,

629
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:54,120
<24-2,CASTLE>-大概在未来20年内  -血腥的能源大战
<24-2,CASTLE>- probably within the next 20 years... - Massive, bloody energy wars?

630
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:55,450
<24-2,CASTLE>就像道尔描述的那样
<24-2,CASTLE>Just like Doyle described.

631
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:58,210
<24-3,HASTING>考虑到地球已经危在旦夕
<24-3,HASTING>Given how compromised our planet already is,

632
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,620
<24-3,HASTING>人类还能幸存吗
<24-3,HASTING>will the human race survive?

633
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:02,930
<24-3,HASTING>谢谢
<24-3,HASTING>Thank you.

634
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,490
<25-1,HASTING>我认识加瑞特·沃德
<25-1,HASTING>Yeah, I knew Garrett Ward.

635
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:11,160
<25-1,HASTING>一开始他来找我们  说的话句句在理
<25-1,HASTING>When he first came to us, he said all the right things--

636
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:14,100
<25-1,HASTING>说石油和煤炭巨头在破坏我们的环境
<25-1,HASTING>How big oil and coal were destroying our environment.

637
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,730
<25-1,HASTING>他甚至帮我策划能源大会的静坐抗议
<25-1,HASTING>He even helped me plan that sit-in on the energy conference.

638
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:18,270
<25-1,HASTING>几周之后  他显然对环境
<25-1,HASTING>After a few weeks, it became obvious

639
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:20,230
<25-1,HASTING>没那么在意了
<25-1,HASTING>he didn't care about the environment.

640
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,600
<25-1,HASTING>当他因为那颗炸弹被抓  我们才明白原因
<25-1,HASTING>When he was caught with that bomb, we realized why.

641
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:25,230
<25-2,CASTLE>他是在利用你混进大会
<25-2,CASTLE>He was using you to get into the conference.

642
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,520
<25-3,BECKETT>你对他这个人有什么了解
<25-3,BECKETT>So how well did you know him personally?

643
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:30,040
<25-4,HASTING>足以确信他是个疯子
<25-4,HASTING>Well, enough to know he was nuts.

644
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:30,990
<25-5,CASTLE>怎么说
<25-5,CASTLE>How so?

645
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:33,610
<25-6,HASTING>他疑神疑鬼
<25-6,HASTING>He was... paranoid.

646
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:35,070
<25-6,HASTING>总是时刻留心  紧张兮兮的
<25-6,HASTING>He was always looking over his shoulder.

647
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:36,300
<25-6,HASTING>他还会说起未来的事
<25-6,HASTING>And he'd say things about the future,

648
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:39,210
<25-6,HASTING>说那些战争浩劫导致的动乱
<25-6,HASTING>messed-up things about apocalyptic wars

649
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:41,160
<25-6,HASTING>说人类多么需要清洗
<25-6,HASTING>and how the human race needed to be cleansed.

650
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,500
<25-6,HASTING>这太诡异了
<25-6,HASTING>It was pretty creepy.

651
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,510
<25-7,BECKETT>有点像你刚才做的某些预测
<25-7,BECKETT>Kind of like some of the predictions you just made?

652
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,110
<25-8,HASTING>不  这不一样
<25-8,HASTING>No. This was different.

653
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,910
<25-8,HASTING>沃德说起时  像是现实一样
<25-8,HASTING>Ward talked about it like it was real,

654
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:49,320
<25-8,HASTING>像是已经发生的事
<25-8,HASTING>like it had already happened.

655
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:55,100
<25-9,CASTLE>他有没有对你说过一个小孩
<25-9,CASTLE>Did he ever say anything to you about a child?

656
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,740
<25-10,HASTING>我不记得说过
<25-10,HASTING>Not that I recall.

657
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:58,660
<25-11,CASTLE>那这个人呢
<25-11,CASTLE>What about this guy?

658
00:25:58,660 --> 00:25:59,800
<25-11,CASTLE>你认识他吗
<25-11,CASTLE>You recognize him?

659
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:01,400
<25-12,HASTING>抱歉
<25-12,HASTING>Sorry.

660
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,660
<25-13,BECKETT>你知道他跟什么人往来密切
<25-13,BECKETT>Do you know if there was anyone that he was close to,

661
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,410
<25-13,BECKETT>或是谁会知道他的下落吗
<25-13,BECKETT>anyone who would know how to find him?

662
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:08,810
<25-14,HASTING>自从他因为那颗炸弹进了监狱
<25-14,HASTING>He burned every bridge he had

663
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:10,420
<25-14,HASTING>大家都跟他断绝了来往
<25-14,HASTING>when he walked in with that bomb.

664
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,530
<25-14,HASTING>但如果你们要找他
<25-14,HASTING>But if you're looking for him,

665
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:13,510
<25-14,HASTING>我会去东河发电站试试
<25-14,HASTING>I'd try the East River Power Plant.

666
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:15,670
<25-14,HASTING>六年前他就住在那儿
<25-14,HASTING>That's where he was living six years ago.

667
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:19,090
<25-14,HASTING>他说住在电磁场覆盖的区域
<25-14,HASTING>He said, uh, the electromagnetic field

668
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,790
<25-14,HASTING>政府更不容易找到他
<25-14,HASTING>made it harder for the government to find him.

669
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:23,870
<25-14,HASTING>我说过  这人是个疯子
<25-14,HASTING>I told you, the guy was crazy.

670
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:36,930
<26-1,CASTLE>这里2010年就关闭了
<26-1,CASTLE>This place shut down in 2010.

671
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:38,520
<26-1,CASTLE>你真觉得他会回到这儿
<26-1,CASTLE>You really think he'd come back here?

672
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,170
<26-2,BECKETT>你要是太害怕  可以在车里等
<26-2,BECKETT>You can stay in the car if you're too scared.

673
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:42,220
<26-3,CASTLE>我一个人
<26-3,CASTLE>Alone?

674
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:44,770
<26-3,CASTLE>在一座废弃的发电站  不了  多谢
<26-3,CASTLE>At an abandoned power plant? No, thank you.

675
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,050
<26-3,CASTLE>也许我们应该在婚誓里加几句
<26-3,CASTLE>Maybe we should put something in our vows

676
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:49,530
<26-3,CASTLE>跟彼此进入诡异的地方应该怎么办
<26-3,CASTLE>about following each other into creepy places.

677
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:54,530
<26-3,CASTLE>我只是说  能源战争
<26-3,CASTLE>Look, I'm just saying-- energy wars,

678
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:56,090
<27-1,CASTLE>来自未来的士兵
<27-1,CASTLE>a soldier from the future--

679
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:58,260
<27-1,CASTLE>一切都支持了道尔的说法
<27-1,CASTLE>Everything seems to support Doyle's story.

680
00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:00,400
<27-1,CASTLE>你难道不为这一切觉得纳闷吗
<27-1,CASTLE>Aren't you weirded out by all this?

681
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,130
<27-2,BECKETT>我为什么要觉得纳闷
<27-2,BECKETT>Why would I be weirded out?

682
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:04,610
<27-2,BECKETT>沃德只是又一个有妄想症的精神分裂者
<27-2,BECKETT>Ward's just another paranoid schizophrenic,

683
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:06,140
<27-2,BECKETT>跟泰德·卡辛斯基[前文提到的炸弹客]
<27-2,BECKETT>No different than Ted Kaczynski

684
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,900
<27-2,BECKETT>或者马克·大卫·查普曼没什么不同
<27-2,BECKETT>Mark David Chapman.

686
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,820
<27-3,CASTLE>那你怎么解释道尔说的那些
<27-3,CASTLE>Then how do you explain Doyle?

687
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:13,850
<27-4,BECKETT>他大概是深陷在自己幻想中的又一个疯子
<27-4,BECKETT>Well, probably another crazy who got caught up in his delusion.

688
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,810
<27-4,BECKETT>他和沃德一定认识对方
<27-4,BECKETT>He and Ward must know each other somehow.

689
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:19,580
<27-4,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<27-4,BECKETT>Castle.

690
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,500
<27-5,BECKETT>有人来过这里
<27-5,BECKETT>Someone's been here.

691
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,500
<27-5,BECKETT>不要  不要
<27-5,BECKETT>Don't--don't--

693
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:52,840
<27-7,BECKETT>是他  走吧
<27-7,BECKETT>It's him. Come on.

694
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,220
<27-8,CASTLE>-你要去哪儿  -呼叫援助
<27-8,CASTLE>- Where are you going? - Call for backup.

695
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:56,510
<27-10,CASTLE>好主意
<27-10,CASTLE>Good idea.

696
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:25,170
<28-1,DOYLE>该死
<28-1,DOYLE>Damn it.

697
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:26,350
<28-2,CASTLE>贝克特
<28-2,CASTLE>Beckett?

698
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:34,740
<28-4,CASTLE>好了
<28-4,CASTLE>Okay.

699
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:37,560
<28-5,CASTLE>你是怎么找到我们的
<28-5,CASTLE>How'd you find us?

700
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:39,500
<28-6,DOYLE>我没有  我是在跟踪沃德
<28-6,DOYLE>I didn't. I was tracking Ward.

701
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:42,830
<28-7,CASTLE>你说过你不认识他  但他认出了你
<28-7,CASTLE>You said you didn't know him, but he recognized you.

702
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:44,130
<28-8,DOYLE>不  他是认出了这个  好吗
<28-8,DOYLE>Well, no, he recognized this, okay?

703
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:45,410
<28-8,DOYLE>这是一个追踪警示灯
<28-8,DOYLE>This is a tracking beacon.

704
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:47,080
<28-10,DOYLE>-什么  -我只需要用这个碰到他
<28-10,DOYLE>- A what? - All I have to do is touch him with it,

705
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:47,900
<28-10,DOYLE>我们的科学家就能把他拉回去
<28-10,DOYLE>and our scientists can pull him right back.

706
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,960
<28-11,BECKETT>放下武器  举起手来
<28-11,BECKETT>Drop your weapon. Hands in the air.

707
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:55,760
<28-11,BECKETT>好吧  别紧张
<28-11,BECKETT>Okay. Easy.

708
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:00,900
<28-12,DOYLE>好吧  警探
<28-12,DOYLE>Okay. Detective,

709
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:02,930
<28-12,DOYLE>真的没必要举枪
<28-12,DOYLE>the gun is really not necessary.

710
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,370
<28-13,BECKETT>没必要才怪
<28-13,BECKETT>The hell it isn't.

711
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:06,050
<28-13,BECKETT>你是怎么逃出拘留室的
<28-13,BECKETT>How did you get out of holding?

712
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:07,760
<28-13,BECKETT>你怎么会牵涉其中
<28-13,BECKETT>And how are you involved?

713
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,430
<28-13,BECKETT>你知道原因
<28-13,BECKETT>You know how.

714
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:12,220
<28-14,DOYLE>你只是不愿意相信我  但请相信我
<28-14,DOYLE>You just don't want to believe me, but trust me,

715
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:13,350
<28-14,DOYLE>警探
<28-14,DOYLE>Detective,

716
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:15,330
<28-14,DOYLE>我们是一边的
<28-14,DOYLE>we're on the same side.

717
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:21,690
<29-1,DOYLE>你有意识到是我救了你  对吧
<29-1,DOYLE>You do realize I just saved your life, right?

718
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:23,690
<29-2,BECKETT>是啊  我是贝克特警探
<29-2,BECKETT>Yeah, this is Detective Beckett.

719
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:24,900
<29-2,BECKETT>我有一个嫌疑犯在逃
<29-2,BECKETT>I've got a suspect at large.

720
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:26,900
<29-2,BECKETT>我需要对这片区域彻底排查
<29-2,BECKETT>I'm gonna need patrol sweeps of the area

721
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:29,410
<29-2,BECKETT>还要一队鉴证组到现场来
<29-2,BECKETT>along with a full C.S.U. Team at the scene.

722
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:30,700
<29-3,DOYLE>她可真是迷人
<29-3,DOYLE>Real charmer, that one.

723
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,220
<29-3,DOYLE>我不敢相信你娶了她
<29-3,DOYLE>I can't believe you marry her.

724
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,340
<29-4,CASTLE>-你怎么知道我娶了她  -你书封面上写的
<29-4,CASTLE>- How did you know I marry her? - One of your book jackets.

725
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,880
<29-5,DOYLE>"理查德·卡塞尔和他的妻子贝克特议员
<29-5,DOYLE>You know, "Richard Castle lives in New York

726
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,630
<29-5,DOYLE>以及他们的三个孩子  住在纽约"
<29-5,DOYLE>with his wife, Senator Beckett, and their three children."

<29-7,BECKETT>-参议员  -三个孩子
<29-7,BECKETT>- Senator? - Three kids?

728
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,500
<29-8,DOYLE>是啊是啊  我自己也有点
<29-8,DOYLE>Yeah. Yeah, yeah. It was kind of hard for me

729
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,350
<29-8,DOYLE>不敢相信  鉴于你们之间发生的
<29-8,DOYLE>to believe myself, given all the crazy stuff

730
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:46,850
<29-9,CASTLE>-那些疯狂的事  -疯狂的事  什么事
<29-9,CASTLE>- that goes on between you along the way. - Crazy stuff? What stuff?

731
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,900
<29-10,DOYLE>你开什么玩笑  她...
<29-10,DOYLE>Are you kidding me? She--

732
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:48,930
<29-11,BECKETT>我再打给你
<29-11,BECKETT>I'll call you back.

733
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,930
<29-12,DOYLE>不  我不该说的  我不该说
<29-12,DOYLE>No, I shouldn't say. I shouldn't say.

734
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:53,130
<29-12,DOYLE>不过我可以告诉你  我真的很高兴
<29-12,DOYLE>I can tell you, thought, that I'm really glad

735
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:54,790
<29-12,DOYLE>你不再写那些愚蠢的悬疑小说了
<29-12,DOYLE>you stopped writing those stupid mystery books, okay?

736
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:56,630
<29-12,DOYLE>因为你的严肃文学要好看多了
<29-12,DOYLE>Because your serious literature is so much better.

737
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:59,330
<29-13,CASTLE>我写了严肃文学  贝克特  你听见了吗
<29-13,CASTLE>I write serious literature? Beckett, you hear that?

738
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:00,780
<29-14,BECKETT>是的  我听见了
<29-14,BECKETT>Yeah, I heard.

739
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,800
<29-14,BECKETT>我还是梦境国的总统呢
<29-14,BECKETT>And I'm the president of fantasyland.

740
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,700
<29-15,DOYLE>不  其实是参议员
<29-15,DOYLE>No, it was--it was senator, actually.

741
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:06,740
<29-15,DOYLE>是议员  前提是沃德
<29-15,DOYLE>It was... Senator, but not if ward

742
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,130
<29-15,DOYLE>没有改变未来  你明白吗
<29-15,DOYLE>changes the future, do you understand me?

743
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:10,130
<29-16,CASTLE>明白  但是威克福德死了
<29-16,CASTLE>Yeah, but didn't the time stream already change

744
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:11,210
<29-16,CASTLE>时间流不是已经改变了
<29-16,CASTLE>with Wickfield's murder?

745
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:13,860
<29-17,DOYLE>不  威克福德的死只是小干扰
<29-17,DOYLE>No, no, Wickfield's death was a--was a minor disruption.

746
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,070
<29-18,CASTLE>但是他所做的一切
<29-18,CASTLE>But all the work he was doing...

747
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,080
<29-19,DOYLE>都无关紧要
<29-19,DOYLE>Never amounted to anything.

748
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,430
<29-19,DOYLE>他对历史无足轻重
<29-19,DOYLE>Nah, he wound up a footnote in history.

749
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:20,770
<29-19,DOYLE>根据我们的计算  大事件
<29-19,DOYLE>According to our calculation, the big event,

750
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:22,720
<29-19,DOYLE>无论是什么  都还没发生
<29-19,DOYLE>Whatever it is, it hasn't happened yet.

751
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,850
<29-20,CASTLE>-那为什么沃德在找他  -我也不知道
<29-20,CASTLE>- Then why was Ward after him?- I don't know.

752
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:26,740
<29-21,DOYLE>你说他在找一个孩子  对吧
<29-21,DOYLE>You--you said he was looking for a child, right?

753
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,100
<29-22,CASTLE>-他有  -卡塞尔
<29-22,CASTLE>- Well, he had-- -Castle!

754
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:29,440
<29-23,BECKETT>他是我们嫌犯
<29-23,BECKETT>He's our suspect.

755
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,290
<29-23,BECKETT>能麻烦你别和他讨论案子的细节吗
<29-23,BECKETT>Could you please not discuss details of our with him?

756
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,690
<29-23,BECKETT>你可以过来帮我
<29-23,BECKETT>Maybe you could come over here and help me

757
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:35,310
<29-23,BECKETT>看看这些东西  没准能找到线索
<29-23,BECKETT>look through this stuff. We might find a clue...

758
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,550
<29-23,BECKETT>知道沃德下一个被害者是谁
<29-23,BECKETT>as to who Ward's next victim's gonna be.

759
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,240
<29-24,CASTLE>仅供参考
<29-24,CASTLE>For your information,

760
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,060
<29-24,CASTLE>我没有讨论案子的细节
<29-24,CASTLE>I wasn't sharing details of the case.

761
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:44,800
<29-24,CASTLE>我在糊弄他看看他知道什么
<29-24,CASTLE>I was playing into his delusion to see what he knew.

762
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:48,040
<29-25,BECKETT>看  这是一封旧信的照片
<29-25,BECKETT>Look at this. This is a photograph of an old letter

763
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,750
<29-25,BECKETT>收信人是马尔科姆·威克福德
<29-25,BECKETT>addressed to Malcolm Wickfield.

764
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,380
<29-25,BECKETT>时间是六年前
<29-25,BECKETT>It's dated six years ago.

765
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:53,930
<29-26,CASTLE>像是一个高中生
<29-26,CASTLE>Looks like it's from a high school student

766
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:56,150
<29-26,CASTLE>请求他在能源大会上发言
<29-26,CASTLE>asking to see him speak at that energy conference.

767
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:57,190
<29-26,CASTLE>沃德怎么会有这个
<29-26,CASTLE>Why would Ward have this?

768
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:58,580
<29-27,BECKETT>不知道  这只是第一页
<29-27,BECKETT>I don't know. It's only the first page,

769
00:30:58,580 --> 00:30:59,910
<29-27,BECKETT>没有名字  没有签名
<29-27,BECKETT>but there's no name or signature.

770
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:02,320
<29-27,BECKETT>看沃德圈出的词
<29-27,BECKETT>But look at the words Ward circled.

771
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,920
<29-28,CASTLE>"布鲁克林"  "PS311"
<29-28,CASTLE>"Brooklyn," "P.S. 311," "State award

772
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,500
<29-28,CASTLE>"州政府去年嘉奖了我的物理项目"
<29-28,CASTLE>last year for my physics project."

773
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:10,290
<29-29,BECKETT>每一个都是写信人的线索
<29-29,BECKETT>Each one's a clue as to the letter writer's identity.

774
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:12,030
<29-29,BECKETT>沃德一定在找他
<29-29,BECKETT>Ward must have been after him.

775
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,450
<29-30,CASTLE>你觉得这是沃德要找的孩子吗
<29-30,CASTLE>Do you think this is the child that Ward is looking for?

776
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,520
<29-31,BECKETT>道尔先生  你知道他是谁吗
<29-31,BECKETT>Mr. Doyle... do you know who he is?

777
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,270
<29-32,DOYLE>不  我以前从没见过他
<29-32,DOYLE>No, no, I've never seen him before.

778
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,400
<29-32,DOYLE>但如果沃德在找他  一定是有原因的
<29-32,DOYLE>But if Ward's targeting him, there must be a reason.

779
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,760
<29-33,CASTLE>沃德为什么要找个高中生呢
<29-33,CASTLE>Why would Ward be after a high school student?

780
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:28,200
<29-34,BECKETT>我也不知道  但我们得先找到他
<29-34,BECKETT>I don't know. But we gotta find him first.

781
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:30,600
<29-35,CASTLE>但是没名字  只有这些线索
<29-35,CASTLE>Yeah, but no name, and only these clues to go on?

782
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,620
<29-35,CASTLE>要花数天
<29-35,CASTLE>It could take days.

783
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,070
<29-36,DOYLE>我能提个议吗
<29-36,DOYLE>Hey, could I make a suggestion?

784
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:34,630
<29-36,DOYLE>你知道  沃德
<29-36,DOYLE>Ward, you know,

785
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:36,360
<29-36,DOYLE>在根据信件的照片查找  对吗
<29-36,DOYLE>he was working off of a photo of the letter, right?

786
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:39,680
<29-36,DOYLE>或许简单点的方法是问问
<29-36,DOYLE>So perhaps the easier path is to ask,

787
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,890
<29-36,DOYLE>原件在哪
<29-36,DOYLE>where's the original?

788
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:42,830
<29-36,DOYLE>上面一定有这孩子的名字和地址
<29-36,DOYLE>It's bound to have the kid's name and address.

789
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:45,130
<29-36,DOYLE>六年前的信
<29-36,DOYLE>A letter from six years ago.

790
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,280
<29-36,DOYLE>好消息是天才都不爱扔东西
<29-36,DOYLE>Good thing most geniuses are pack rats.

791
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,140
<29-36,DOYLE>我一直劝他把这些扔出去
<29-36,DOYLE>I kept trying to get him to throw some of this stuff out,

792
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:53,460
<30-1,ESPOSITO>但是他从不  让我再看一眼照片
<30-1,ESPOSITO>But he never would. Uh, let me see that picture again.

793
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:56,280
<30-2,RYAN>你确定以前没看见过这孩子
<30-2,RYAN>You sure you've never seen the kid before?

794
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,860
<30-3,ESPOSITO>没有  但马尔科姆总是很鼓励学生
<30-3,ESPOSITO>No, but, uh, Malcolm was very encouraging to students,

795
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:02,120
<30-4,ESPOSITO>有可能他认识这孩子
<30-4,ESPOSITO>so it's a possibility that he knew him.

796
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,160
<30-5,RYAN>等等
<30-5,RYAN>Wait a minute.

797
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,410
<30-5,RYAN>这里
<30-5,RYAN>Here.

798
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:16,450
<30-5,RYAN>就是它
<30-5,RYAN>That's it.

799
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,910
<30-5,RYAN>写信人是个叫保罗·杜查尔的孩子
<30-5,RYAN>It's written by some kid named Paul Deschile.

800
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,060
<30-5,RYAN>等等  不是
<30-5,RYAN>Wait a second. No.

801
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,770
<30-5,RYAN>不是蒂希尔
<30-5,RYAN>That's not "De-shiel." Um...

802
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:28,740
<30-5,RYAN>是 杜查尔
<30-5,RYAN>It's "Duh-child."

803
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:30,430
<30-5,RYAN>他不是在找"孩子"
<30-5,RYAN>He wasn't looking for "the child,"

804
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,120
<30-5,RYAN>而是在找"杜查尔"[音似]
<30-5,RYAN>he was looking for Deschile.

805
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,700
<31-1,BECKETT>保罗·杜查尔是谁
<31-1,BECKETT>Who the hell's Paul Deschile?

806
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:38,570
<31-2,RYAN>他是个21岁  在哈德森大学
<31-2,RYAN>He's a 21-year-old student at Hudson

807
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:41,350
<31-2,RYAN>在读理论物理的博士后
<31-2,RYAN>getting his post-doc in theoretical physics.

808
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:43,220
<31-3,BECKETT>对他进行保护性拘留
<31-3,BECKETT>All right, get him into protective custody.

809
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,340
<31-4,RYAN>他这学期不在学校
<31-4,RYAN>He's on leave this semester.

810
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:46,210
<31-4,RYAN>校方也不知道他在哪
<31-4,RYAN>The university has no idea where he is.

811
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:47,410
<31-4,RYAN>还在找他的父母
<31-4,RYAN>Still trying to look for his parents,

812
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,850
<31-4,RYAN>-他们几年前搬去了别的州  -探长  就是他
<31-4,RYAN>- but they moved out of state a few years ago. - Detective, It's him!

813
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,670
<31-6,CASTLE>杜查尔  你知道他
<31-6,CASTLE>Deschile. You know him?

814
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:52,600
<31-7,DOYLE>我当然知道他  每个人都知道他
<31-7,DOYLE>Of course I know him. Everyone knows him.

815
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,020
<31-7,DOYLE>天啊  要是他死了
<31-7,DOYLE>Oh, man, if-- if he's killed...

816
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:56,100
<31-8,BECKETT>好  我一会儿打给你  道尔  坐下
<31-8,BECKETT>Okay, I'll call you back. Doyle, sit down.

817
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,790
<31-9,DOYLE>难怪亿万人会死
<31-9,DOYLE>No wonder billions of people die.

818
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:59,520
<31-10,CASTLE>好吧  到底谁是保罗·杜查尔
<31-10,CASTLE>Okay, who the hell is Paul Deschile?

819
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,820
<31-11,DOYLE>能源战争  我告诉过你敌方的事
<31-11,DOYLE>The energy wars, all right? I told you about the other side.

820
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:03,780
<31-11,DOYLE>一群法西斯主义者  比纳粹还糟糕
<31-11,DOYLE>A group of fascists-- they were worse than the nazis.

821
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:05,150
<31-11,DOYLE>他们杀的人
<31-11,DOYLE>Th-they were slaughtering people

822
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,830
<31-11,DOYLE>有好几百万  好吗
<31-11,DOYLE>by the tens of thousands, okay?

823
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,940
<31-11,DOYLE>他们一直在胜利
<31-11,DOYLE>They were winning.

824
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:10,840
<31-11,DOYLE>直到杜查尔和他的团队创造出了能源盾牌
<31-11,DOYLE>Until Deschile--he and his team, they created an energy shield.

825
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,270
<31-11,DOYLE>阻止了他们的武器
<31-11,DOYLE>Okay? It was able to stop their weapons

826
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:13,750
<31-11,DOYLE>完全扭转了局面
<31-11,DOYLE>and completely turn the tide.

827
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:14,930
<31-11,DOYLE>探长  听我说
<31-11,DOYLE>Detective, listen to me!

828
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:17,350
<31-11,DOYLE>沃德很明显是为了法西斯而战的
<31-11,DOYLE>Ward is still obviously fighting for the fascists!

829
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:20,020
<31-11,DOYLE>他们试图通过改写历史  获得战争胜利
<31-11,DOYLE>They're trying to win the war by rewriting history!

830
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:22,910
<31-11,DOYLE>如果他杀了杜查尔  就没有能源盾牌了
<31-11,DOYLE>And if he kills Deschile, there will be no energy shield!

831
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:25,540
<31-11,DOYLE>没有能源盾牌  我们就输了
<31-11,DOYLE>And without that energy shield, we lose that war!

832
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:27,080
<31-8,BECKETT>沃德要杀杜查尔
<31-8,BECKETT>Ward's gonna kill Deschile,

833
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,630
<31-9,DOYLE>所以数十亿的人才会死
<31-9,DOYLE>and that is why billions of people die!

834
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,190
<31-12,BECKETT>行了  你知道么  没时间听你瞎说了
<31-12,BECKETT>Okay, you know what? We don't have time for this.

835
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:32,670
<31-12,BECKETT>-把他拘留起来  -好吧
<31-12,BECKETT>-Take him to holding, please. - Fine,

836
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:34,340
<31-12,BECKETT>我们是没时间了  你对了  好了吧
<31-12,BECKETT>we don't have time. You're correct, okay?

837
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:36,790
<31-13,DOYLE>忘了我说的  忘了时间穿越
<31-13,DOYLE>Forget everything I said! Forget about time travel!

838
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:38,830
<31-13,DOYLE>忘了战争  都不重要
<31-13,DOYLE>Forget about wars! None of that matters!

839
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:41,250
<31-13,DOYLE>重要的是杜查尔  你懂了吗
<31-13,DOYLE>All that matters is Deschile! You understand me?

840
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:44,330
<31-13,DOYLE>你要让他活着  他不能死
<31-13,DOYLE>You keep him alive! He cannot die!

841
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:49,870
<32-1,BECKETT>不  杜查尔  对
<32-1,BECKETT>No. Deschile. Yeah.

842
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:51,390
<32-1,BECKETT>保罗·杜查尔
<32-1,BECKETT>Paul Deschile.

843
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:54,140
<32-1,BECKETT>不  等等  别让我等着
<32-1,BECKETT>No, wait, please don't-- don't put me on hold.

844
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:56,100
<32-2,CASTLE>-有消息了  -埃斯波西托
<32-2,CASTLE>- Anything? - Esposito

845
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,230
<32-3,BECKETT>在俄勒冈找了他父母
<32-3,BECKETT>got ahold of his parents in Oregon.

846
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:59,860
<32-3,BECKETT>他们觉得他在城里的一个朋友家
<32-3,BECKETT>They think he's staying with a friend in the city,

847
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,680
<32-3,BECKETT>我正在联系他
<32-3,BECKETT>which is who I'm holding for now.

848
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:05,210
<32-4,CASTLE>你不会觉得这是真的吧
<32-4,CASTLE>You don't think any of this could possibly be real, do you?

849
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:06,120
<32-4,CASTLE>我也不知道  卡塞尔
<32-4,CASTLE>I don't know, Castle,

850
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,960
<32-5,BECKETT>但我不想让这个孩子死
<32-5,BECKETT>but I have no intention of letting this kid die.

851
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,900
<32-5,BECKETT>你好  我是纽约警局凯特·贝克特探长

854
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:18,490
<32-7,CASTLE>他在天文馆
<32-7,CASTLE>He's at the planetarium.

855
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,100
<32-5,BECKETT>等等  你也告诉另一个人了
<32-5,BECKETT>Wait, just like you told what other guy?

856
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:21,450
<32-5,BECKETT>你还告诉谁了
<32-5,BECKETT>Who else did you tell?

857
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:24,920
<32-6,BECKETT>沃德知道了
<32-6,BECKETT>Ward knows.

858
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,210
<32-7,CASTLE>天文馆在上城区
<32-7,CASTLE>Planetarium's all the way uptown.

859
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:27,480
<32-7,CASTLE>我们赶不及了
<32-7,CASTLE>We'll never get there in time.

860
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:31,460
<33-1,PLANETARIUM NARRATOR>宇宙是浩渺而壮丽的
<33-1,PLANETARIUM NARRATOR>The cosmos is vast and glorious--

861
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,350
<33-1,PLANETARIUM NARRATOR>奇妙得超乎我们的想象
<33-1,PLANETARIUM NARRATOR>More wondrous than we can fathom.

862
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:38,870
<33-1,PLANETARIUM NARRATOR>它让我们惊叹不已  点亮我们的想象
<33-1,PLANETARIUM NARRATOR>It takes our breath away and ignites our imagination.

863
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:42,140
<33-1,PLANETARIUM NARRATOR>它是时间的本质
<33-1,PLANETARIUM NARRATOR>It is the essence of time itself--

864
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:45,350
<33-1,PLANETARIUM NARRATOR>过去  现在  未来
<33-1,PLANETARIUM NARRATOR>The past, the present, and the future.

865
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:49,680
<33-1,PLANETARIUM NARRATOR>它似乎就是无法解开的谜团
<33-1,PLANETARIUM NARRATOR>It's an enigma seemingly impossible to grasp,

866
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:53,000
<33-1,PLANETARIUM NARRATOR>然而我们还是去探寻它的神秘
<33-1,PLANETARIUM NARRATOR>and yet we pursue its mysteries.

867
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:56,000
<33-1,PLANETARIUM NARRATOR>我们勇敢地走出去  试图了解
<33-1,PLANETARIUM NARRATOR>We dare to reach out to understand

868
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,870
<33-1,PLANETARIUM NARRATOR>漩涡状星系  爆发星
<33-1,PLANETARIUM NARRATOR>swirling galaxies, exploding stars...

869
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:22,500
<33-2,ESPOSITO>不许动
<33-2,ESPOSITO>Freeze!

870
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:25,860
<33-3,ESPOSITO>想都别想
<33-3,ESPOSITO>Don't even think about it!

871
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,980
<33-4,RYAN>纽约警局  举起你的手
<33-4,RYAN>N.Y.P.D.! Let me see your hands right now!

872

873
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,120
<33-6,RYAN>你还好吗  小子
<33-6,RYAN>You okay, kid?

874
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,710
<34-1,BECKETT>为什么要杀威克福德
<34-1,BECKETT>Why Wickfield?

875
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:48,870
<34-1,BECKETT>为什么要杀杜查尔
<34-1,BECKETT>Why deschile?

876
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,690
<34-2,BECKETT>你想达到什么目的
<34-2,BECKETT>What were you hoping to accomplish?

877
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,730
<34-3,BECKETT>他是谁
<34-3,BECKETT>Who is that man?

878
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:18,430
<34-3,BECKETT>在发电厂  你看到他就跑掉了  为什么
<34-3,BECKETT>You ran from him at the power plant. Why?

879
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:26,680
<34-4,BECKETT>沃德先生  2007年之前系统里没有你的记录
<34-4,BECKETT>Mr. Ward, there is no record of you before 2007.

880
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,480
<34-4,BECKETT>你从哪来的
<34-4,BECKETT>Where are you from?

881
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:35,650
<34-5,BECKETT>好吧  沃德
<34-5,BECKETT>Okay, Ward.

882
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,940
<34-6,BECKETT>不管你认为你在干什么
<34-6,BECKETT>Whatever you thought you were doing...

883
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:47,190
<34-6,BECKETT>都结束了
<34-6,BECKETT>It's over.

884
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,280
<35-1,CASTLE>他说什么了
<35-1,CASTLE>What'd he say?

885
00:36:57,570 --> 00:36:59,410
<35-3,CASTLE>-什么都没说  -没有末日景象
<35-3,CASTLE>- Nothing. - No apocalyptic visions,

886
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:02,120
<35-3,CASTLE>没有对即将到来的灾难的噩梦般警告吗
<35-3,CASTLE>no nightmarish warnings of dire things to come?

887
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,190
<35-4,BECKETT>不管他有什么妄想
<35-4,BECKETT>Whatever delusions he has in his head,

888
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,260
<35-4,BECKETT>他都不打算告诉别人
<35-4,BECKETT>he is keeping them to himself.

889
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:08,840
<35-5,CASTLE>如果道尔说的都是假的
<35-5,CASTLE>Well, if nothing Doyle said was true,

890
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,840
<35-5,CASTLE>沃德为什么想对杜查尔下杀手
<35-5,CASTLE>why else would Ward target Deschile?

891
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,120
<35-6,ESPOSITO>我们能回答这个问题
<35-6,ESPOSITO>I think we can answer that.

892
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:14,390
<35-7,PAUL DESCHILE>六年前  在一个能源会议上  是我
<35-7,PAUL DESCHILE>I'm the one who alerted security to Ward's behavior

893
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:16,470
<35-7,PAUL DESCHILE>向安保警告了沃德的行为
<35-7,PAUL DESCHILE>at the energy conference six years ago.

894
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,070
<35-7,PAUL DESCHILE>他们因为我而阻止了他
<35-7,PAUL DESCHILE>They stopped him because of me.

895
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:20,150
<35-8,ESPOSITO>看起来一切都是为了报仇
<35-8,ESPOSITO>It looks like this was all just about revenge.

896
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:23,440
<35-9,PAUL>我只是对威克福德博士为此丧命而感到抱歉
<35-9,PAUL>I'm just sorry it cost Dr. Wickfield his life.

897
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:25,390
<35-9,PAUL>知道吗  他在那次会议上的发言
<35-9,PAUL>You know, the talk he gave at that conference

898
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:27,670
<35-9,PAUL>改变了我的世界  如果不是他
<35-9,PAUL>rocked my world, and if it wasn't for him,

899
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:30,710
<35-9,PAUL>我可能在做完全不同的事情
<35-9,PAUL>I'd probably be doing something completely different with my life.

900
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:32,250
<35-10,ESPOSITO>走吧  我送你出去
<35-10,ESPOSITO>Come on, man. I'll walk you out.

901
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:38,670
<35-11,BECKETT>看来  还是有一个简单合理的解释的
<35-11,BECKETT>So, there is a simple explanation after all.

902
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:43,440
<35-12,CASTLE>是的  现在我们知道沃德为什么要炸会议现场了
<35-12,CASTLE>Yes. Now we know why Ward tried to bomb that conference--

903
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,660
<35-12,CASTLE>要杀掉杜查尔
<35-12,CASTLE>To kill Deschile.

904
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:46,690
<35-12,CASTLE>你看  在未来  已经成名了的杜查尔
<35-12,CASTLE>You see, in the future, when the famous Deschile

905
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:48,840
<35-12,CASTLE>会接受采访  他会提到一切开始的地方
<35-12,CASTLE>will give interviews, he'll say that's where it all started.

906
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,370
<35-12,CASTLE>巧合的是  沃德也会知道具体在哪里
<35-12,CASTLE>Consequently, Ward will know exactly where--

907
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:54,210
<35-12,CASTLE>在什么时候  找到他
<35-12,CASTLE>and when--to find him.

908
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:57,370
<35-13,BECKETT>你是想把我逼疯  是吧
<35-13,BECKETT>You're trying to drive me crazy, aren't you?

909
00:37:57,370 --> 00:38:00,520
<35-14,CASTLE>很显然已经逼疯了  如果我们育有三个孩子的话
<35-14,CASTLE>Well, apparently I already do, if we end up with three kids.

910
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,820
<35-15,DOYLE>想知道他们的名字吗
<35-15,DOYLE>Would you like to know their names?

911
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:03,960
<35-16,CASTLE>-想  -不想
<35-16,CASTLE>- Yes. - No!

912
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:06,820
<35-18,BECKETT>道尔  你怎么被放出来了
<35-18,BECKETT>Doyle? What are you doing out?

913
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,200
<35-19,DOYLE>你说我有权利请律师
<35-19,DOYLE>Well, you said that I had the right to an attorney,

914
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,330
<35-19,DOYLE>律师说你不能再把我关在这了
<35-19,DOYLE>and he said that you couldn't keep me anymore.

915
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:11,700
<35-20,BECKETT>-你的心理评估呢  -得了吧  你在开玩笑吗
<35-20,BECKETT>- What about your psych eval? - Oh, please. Are you kidding me?

916
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,180
<35-21,DOYLE>我轻松通过有没有
<35-21,DOYLE>I passed that with flying colors.

917
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:15,220
<35-21,DOYLE>不过你真该听听从我嘴里说出的那些话
<35-21,DOYLE>But you should have heard the crazy stuff coming out of my mouth.

918
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:16,690
<35-21,DOYLE>在丹佛长大  中产家庭
<35-21,DOYLE>Growing up in Denver, middle-class family.

919
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:18,140
<35-21,DOYLE>真是的  我好久没说那么多谎话了
<35-21,DOYLE>I mean, I haven't lied that much in years.

920
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:20,700
<35-23,DOYLE>-但是  -哎呦  探长  别烦躁
<35-23,DOYLE>- But I-- -  Now, now, Detective, don't be upset.

921
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:23,280
<35-23,DOYLE>因为你  亿万人活了下来
<35-23,DOYLE>Because of you, billions of people are alive.

922
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:25,590
<35-23,DOYLE>因为你  未来的几代人是安全的
<35-23,DOYLE>Because of you, future generations are safe.

923
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:27,050
<35-24,BECKETT>我才不管这些  道尔
<35-24,BECKETT>I don't care what you say, Doyle.

924
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:28,740
<35-24,BECKETT>你和沃德之间是有联系的
<35-24,BECKETT>There's a connection between you and Ward,

925
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:31,340
<35-24,BECKETT>而且这联系跟时间旅行没有关系
<35-24,BECKETT>and it has nothing to do with time travel.

926
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:33,150
<35-24,BECKETT>我会找到的
<35-24,BECKETT>And I'm gonna find out what it is.

927
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:34,930
<35-25,DOYLE>好吧  祝你好运
<35-25,DOYLE>Okay. Good luck.

928
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:37,410
<35-25,DOYLE>因为在昨天之前  我都没见过沃德
<35-25,DOYLE>Because before yesterday, I had never even met Ward.

929
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,850
<35-26,RYAN>那可不是真话
<35-26,RYAN>That's not entirely true.

930
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,950
<35-26,RYAN>我翻看沃德的监禁档案
<35-26,RYAN>I went back through Ward's incarceration file.

931
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:44,010
<35-26,RYAN>审判前  他在州政府的批准下
<35-26,RYAN>Before his trial, he spent two weeks

932
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:47,380
<35-26,RYAN>在一个精神科病房待了两周  被心理评估
<35-26,RYAN>in a psychiatric ward being evaluated by the state.

933
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:50,300
<35-26,RYAN>隔壁是另一位患者  无名氏
<35-26,RYAN>In the next room was another patient, a john doe.

934
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:51,940
<35-26,RYAN>我调出了他的照片
<35-26,RYAN>I had them pull his photo.

935
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:54,230
<35-27,BECKETT>找到联系了
<35-27,BECKETT>And there's the connection.

936
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,200
<35-28,DOYLE>不不不  那太扯了
<35-28,DOYLE>No, no, no. That-- that's--that's ridiculous.

937
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,740
<35-28,DOYLE>因为我从来没……
<35-28,DOYLE>Because I have never, ever...

938
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:02,550
<35-28,DOYLE>天啊  太机智了
<35-28,DOYLE>Oh, wow, that's really clever.

939
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:03,910
<35-29,CASTLE>什么  哪里机智了
<35-29,CASTLE>What? What's clever?

940
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:05,210
<35-29,CASTLE>那是我
<35-29,CASTLE>That's me.

941
00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:07,010
<35-30,DOYLE>但是我还没干那些事呢
<35-30,DOYLE>Right? But I-I haven't done it yet.

942
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:08,190
<35-30,DOYLE>你看不出吗
<35-30,DOYLE>Don't you see?

943
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:09,810
<35-30,DOYLE>现在他们知道沃德是谁  在哪
<35-30,DOYLE>Now that they know who Ward is and where he's gonna be...

944
00:39:09,810 --> 00:39:11,940
<35-30,DOYLE>他们会把我派回去  与他接触
<35-30,DOYLE>They're gonna send me back to make contact with him,

945
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:13,760
<35-30,DOYLE>找出他的雇主  查出他们的其他计划
<35-30,DOYLE>find out who he works for, if they're planning anything else.

946
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,820
<35-30,DOYLE>堪称完美
<35-30,DOYLE>It's perfect.

947
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:19,850
<35-31,DOYLE>呃  我没有多少时间了
<35-31,DOYLE>Oh, wow. Uh, I don't have much time left.

948
00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:22,000
<35-31,DOYLE>怎么说好呢  20年后见
<35-31,DOYLE>Um... I don't know. See you in 20 years.

949
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:26,330
<35-32,CASTLE>是我的幻觉  还是这一切都说得通啊
<35-32,CASTLE>Is it--is it just me, or does that make sense?

950
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:27,520
<35-33,RYAN>是你的幻觉
<35-33,RYAN>No, it's just you.

951
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:29,790
<35-34,CASTLE>他忘拿自己的小玩意了
<35-34,CASTLE>Ooh, he forgot his little doohickey there.

952
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:55,820
<35-35,BECKETT>怎么了
<35-35,BECKETT>Hey. So what happened?

953
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:01,110
<35-36,CASTLE>没赶上他
<35-36,CASTLE>Missed him.

954
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:04,790
<35-36,CASTLE>你猜怎么着
<35-36,CASTLE>You know what?

955
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,940
<35-37,BECKETT>在这样一个案子后  一个暖和舒适的泡澡
<35-37,BECKETT>After a case like this one, I think a warm and cozy bath

956
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,330
<35-37,BECKETT>会在我的未来发生
<35-37,BECKETT>is in my future.

957
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:12,870
<35-37,BECKETT>今晚给你打电话
<35-37,BECKETT>Talk to you tonight?

958
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:14,590
<35-38,CASTLE>好
<35-38,CASTLE>Sounds good.

959
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,690
<36-1,CASTLE>你真的要这么做
<36-1,CASTLE>You're really doing this?

960
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,840
<36-2,ALEXIS>是的
<36-2,ALEXIS>I am.

961
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:06,410
<36-2,ALEXIS>我知道你在想什么
<36-2,ALEXIS>I know what you're thinking.

962
00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:08,660
<36-2,ALEXIS>你认为我在犯了一个大错
<36-2,ALEXIS>You're thinking I'm making a huge mistake.

963
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,350
<36-3,CASTLE>如果我的想法是对的呢
<36-3,CASTLE>What if you are?

964
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:15,580
<36-3,CASTLE>这不是一件你可以倒回去重做的事
<36-3,CASTLE>This isn't something you can just go back and undo.

965
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:17,900
<36-3,CASTLE>你要不再等一年
<36-3,CASTLE>Why don't you wait a year, okay?

966
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:18,790
<36-3,CASTLE>搬到宿舍
<36-3,CASTLE>Move into the dorms.

967
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:20,690
<36-3,CASTLE>我确信派可以照顾他自己
<36-3,CASTLE>I'm sure Pi can take care of himself.

968
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,960
<36-3,CASTLE>如果一年后  你还是想跟他同居
<36-3,CASTLE>And if after a year you still want to move in together,

969
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,800
<36-3,CASTLE>我绝不会反对
<36-3,CASTLE>I won't say a word.

970
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,930
<36-4,ALEXIS>你会
<36-4,ALEXIS>Yes, you will.

971
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:29,180
<36-4,ALEXIS>我不知道这会有什么结果
<36-4,ALEXIS>I don't know how this is gonna turn out, dad.

972
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:31,260
<36-4,ALEXIS>我们都不知道
<36-4,ALEXIS>None of us do.

973
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:35,220
<36-4,ALEXIS>但这是我的生活  我的未来
<36-4,ALEXIS>But it's my life, my future.

974
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,170
<36-4,ALEXIS>我得自己去发现
<36-4,ALEXIS>I have to find out for myself.

975
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:42,920
<36-4,ALEXIS>你总说家里谁最聪明来着
<36-4,ALEXIS>Who are you always saying is the smart one in the family?

976
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:46,480
<36-5,CASTLE>你
<36-5,CASTLE>You.

977
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:50,210
<36-6,ALEXIS>爸  我知道我在做什么
<36-6,ALEXIS>Dad, I know what I'm doing.

978
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,910
<36-6,ALEXIS>没事的
<36-6,ALEXIS>It'll be okay.

979
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,820
<36-7,CASTLE>孩子长大得太快了
<36-7,CASTLE>Too soon.
