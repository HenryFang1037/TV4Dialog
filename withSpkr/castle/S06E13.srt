00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:06,340
<13-21,ALEXIS>天呐  那辆好像是她的车
<13-21,ALEXIS>Oh, my God. I think that's her car.

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,300
<1-1,DOORMAN>好了大伙儿  都让开点
<1-1,DOORMAN>All, right, guys! Keep it clear.

5
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,210
<1-1,DOORMAN>你们就没别的事可做了吗
<1-1,DOORMAN>Don't you have anything better to do?

6
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:15,050
<1-2,HARVEY STRYKER>曼迪  曼迪
<1-2,HARVEY STRYKER>Mandy, Mandy!

7
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:20,880
<1-2,HARVEY STRYKER>曼迪  你分手以后跟扎克说过话吗
<1-2,HARVEY STRYKER>Mandy, have you--have you spoken to Zach since the breakup?

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,810
<1-3,HARVEY>你后悔劈腿吗
<1-3,HARVEY>Do you regret cheating on him?

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:25,900
<1-3,HARVEY>传言说你又回戒毒所了
<1-3,HARVEY>Is there any truth to the rumor

10
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,820
<1-3,HARVEY>是真的吗
<1-3,HARVEY>that you're going back into rehab?

11
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,140
<2-1,KATE BECKETT>卡塞尔
<2-1,KATE BECKETT>Castle?

12
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,400
<2-2,RICHARD CASTLE>我该担心你对我们婚约的承诺吗
<2-2,RICHARD CASTLE>Should I be worried about your commitment to our engagement?

13
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,160
<2-3,BECKETT>不该  干什么
<2-3,BECKETT>No. Why?

14
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:39,900
<2-4,CASTLE>报纸上写着
<2-4,CASTLE>'cause it says right here

15
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:41,810
<2-5,BECKETT>你要跟前妻复合了
<2-5,BECKETT>that you're getting back together with your ex-wife.

16
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:43,880
<2-6,CASTLE>-什么  -就这儿  第六版
<2-6,CASTLE>- What? - Right here. Page six.

17
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:47,540
<2-7,BECKETT>卡塞尔被撞见跟出版商前妻拥抱
<2-7,BECKETT>"Castle caught cuddling with ex-wife publisher."

18
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:49,350
<2-8,CASTLE>不不  这是工作午餐
<2-8,CASTLE>No, no, this was a business lunch.

19
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,100
<2-8,CASTLE>我们在谈希特和斯道姆系列丛书的事
<2-8,CASTLE>We were discussing Heat and Storm books.

20
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,330
<2-9,BECKETT>所以你没有
<2-9,BECKETT>Oh, so, um, you weren't...

21
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:55,980
<2-9,BECKETT>深情凝视她的双眸
<2-9,BECKETT>"Gazing lovingly into her eyes"?

22
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,590
<2-10,CASTLE>她牙里卡了菠菜  这可真是  好吧
<2-10,CASTLE>She had spinach in her teeth. That's just--okay.

23
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,760
<2-10,CASTLE>我真不  你看  要是你让我
<2-10,CASTLE>I don't--see, this wouldn't happen

26
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,080
<2-10,CASTLE>宣布咱们订婚了  这种事怎么会发生
<2-10,CASTLE>if you just let me announce our engagement.

27
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,140
<2-11,BECKETT>我们早就谈过了
<2-11,BECKETT>We already talked about this.

28
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:04,920
<2-11,BECKETT>我们生命中重要的人都已经知道了
<2-11,BECKETT>Everyone that's important to us already knows.

30
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,360
<2-12,CASTLE>是的  我是公众人物
<2-12,CASTLE>Yes, and just because I'm a public figure

31
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,940
<2-12,CASTLE>不代表你也要成为公众人物  我明白
<2-12,CASTLE>doesn't mean you need to be one, too. I know.

32
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:08,760
<2-13,BECKETT>正是
<2-13,BECKETT>Exactly.

34
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:11,290
<2-14,CASTLE>只要你不介意发生这种事
<2-14,CASTLE>Well... As long as you don't mind this sort of thing happening.

35
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:13,480
<2-15,BECKETT>我不介意  又不是真的
<2-15,BECKETT>I don't. 'cause it's not true.

37
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,930
<2-15,BECKETT>这只会给我更多折磨你的材料
<2-15,BECKETT>And it only gives me more material to torture you with.

38
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,420
<2-16,CASTLE>青出于蓝胜于蓝啊
<2-16,CASTLE>Mm, and the student becomes the master.

39
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,310
<2-17,CASTLE>谁大清早6点45分按别人家门铃啊
<2-17,CASTLE>Who rings the doorbell at 6:45 in the morning?

40
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,450
<2-18,PI>C先生  但愿没吵醒你
<2-18,PI>Hey, Mr. C.! Hope I didn't wake ya.

41
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:26,080
<2-19,CASTLE>没有
<2-19,CASTLE>No.

42
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,210
<2-20,PI>我正要去上班
<2-20,PI>I was just on my way to work,

43
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,070
<2-20,PI>就顺便来拿我的推荐信
<2-20,PI>thought I would pick up my letter of recommendation.

44
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:31,950
<2-21,CASTLE>是啊  你那个经费申请
<2-21,CASTLE>Right! For your grant, uh, application.

45
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,490
<2-22,PI>很感谢你帮我
<2-22,PI>Really appreciate you doing it.

46
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:35,100
<2-23,CASTLE>我是跟阿丽克西斯说我写完了
<2-23,CASTLE>I know I told Alexis I was finished,

47
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,070
<2-23,CASTLE>但其实还没有
<2-23,CASTLE>but I-I hadn't really quite, um...

48
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:39,520
<2-23,CASTLE>我还在修改  一定要写好
<2-23,CASTLE>I'm still tweaking it. This--I'm getting it just right.

49
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,750
<2-24,PI>你跟我一样  是完美主义者
<2-24,PI>You're a perfectionist, like me.

50
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:44,440
<2-24,PI>慢慢来  也别太慢了
<2-24,PI>Well, take your time-- not too much time.

<2-24,PI>今晚截止了
<2-24,PI>Deadline's tonight.

52
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:47,190
<2-25,CASTLE>中午就能写好
<2-25,CASTLE>I'll have it done by lunch.

53
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,730
<2-26,PI>谢了  C先生
<2-26,PI>Thanks, Mr. C.!

54
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:49,910
<2-26,PI>你最好了
<2-26,PI>You're the best!

55
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:50,710
<2-27,CASTLE>我知道
<2-27,CASTLE>I know.

56
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,240
<2-28,BECKETT>派
<2-28,BECKETT>Hi, Pi!

57
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,130
<2-29,PI>拜
<2-29,PI>Bye!

58
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,720
<2-30,BECKETT>你一个字都没写  对吧
<2-30,BECKETT>You haven't written a word, have you?

59
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,640
<2-31,CASTLE>是的  但容我说一句  我要写什么
<2-31,CASTLE>No. But in my defense, what am I supposed to write?

60
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,240
<2-32,BECKETT>-那可是派  -那你为什么主动提出帮忙
<2-32,BECKETT>- It's Pi. - So then why'd you offer?

61
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,260
<2-33,CASTLE>我没有  阿丽克西斯拜托我的  我没法拒绝
<2-33,CASTLE>I didn't. Alexis asked. I can't say no.

62
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:07,880
<2-33,CASTLE>但不再多说借口了  我现在就写
<2-33,CASTLE>But no more excuses. I'm gonna do it right now.

63
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,350
<2-34,CASTLE>除非发生凶杀案了
<2-34,CASTLE>Unless that's a murder.

64
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:13,660
<3-1,HARVEY>我是专盯名人网的哈维·史崔克
<3-1,HARVEY>This is Harvey Stryker with CelebGazer.com.

65
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:14,980
<3-1,HARVEY>我们收到未经确认的消息称
<3-1,HARVEY>We're getting unconfirmed reports that

66
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:17,680
<3-1,HARVEY>流行天后曼迪·萨顿身亡  年仅22岁
<3-1,HARVEY>pop diva Mandy Sutton is dead at 22.

67
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,310
<3-2,CASTLE>曼迪·萨顿  不是吧
<3-2,CASTLE>Mandy Sutton? Oh, no.

68
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,400
<3-2,CASTLE>阿丽克西斯以前很喜欢她的儿童剧曼迪·曼乐迪
<3-2,CASTLE>Alexis used to love her kids show, "Mandy Melody".

69
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,380
<3-2,CASTLE>她白天是个普通的青少年
<3-2,CASTLE>She was a regular teen by day

70
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,570
<3-2,CASTLE>晚上就化身为打击罪案的歌星
<3-2,CASTLE>and a crime-fighting pop star by night.

71
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:28,660
<3-2,CASTLE>但学校里的人都不知道  因为她白天戴眼镜
<3-2,CASTLE>But no one recognized her at school because she wore glasses.

72
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:31,220
<3-3,BECKETT>看来她这招也该用在现实生活中
<3-3,BECKETT>Well, it looks like she could've used that trick in real life.

73
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,830
<3-3,BECKETT>看看这些人  难怪她生活一团糟了
<3-3,BECKETT>I mean, look at this. No wonder she was such a mess.

74
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:34,630
<3-4,HARVEY>警探
<3-4,HARVEY>Detective!

75
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,350
<3-4,HARVEY>能为我们确认曼迪·萨顿的死讯吗
<3-4,HARVEY>Can you confirm for us that Mandy Sutton's dead?

76
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:37,020
<3-5,BECKETT>我...
<3-5,BECKETT>I, you know...

77
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,620
<3-6,HARVEY>能说说她是怎么死的吗
<3-6,HARVEY>Can you give us any details about how she died?

78
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,640
<3-7,BECKETT>我得走了  还要做事  抱歉
<3-7,BECKETT>I gotta go. I have work to do. Sorry.

79
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,910
<3-8,HARVEY>理查德·卡塞尔
<3-8,HARVEY>Oh, hey, Richard Castle.

80
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,810
<3-8,HARVEY>你要跟前妻复合的消息是真的吗
<3-8,HARVEY>Is it true that you're getting back together with your ex-wife?

81
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,450
<3-9,CASTLE>今天的主角不是我
<3-9,CASTLE>This isn't about me today.

82
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,110
<3-9,CASTLE>卡塞尔
<3-9,CASTLE>Uh, Castle?

83
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,350
<4-1,BECKETT>你为什么不否认
<4-1,BECKETT>How come you didn't deny it?

84
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,130
<4-2,CASTLE>否认什么  刚刚的事吗  开什么玩笑
<4-2,CASTLE>What do you mean? Back there? Are you kidding?

85
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,210
<4-2,CASTLE>要是否认了  他们就该以为是真的了
<4-2,CASTLE>Yeah, if I deny that, then they think it's true.

86
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,330
<4-2,CASTLE>你不是说不介意吗
<4-2,CASTLE>I thought that stuff didn't bother you.

87
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:55,380
<4-2,CASTLE>是不介意
<4-2,CASTLE>It doesn't.

88
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,260
<4-3,BECKETT>曼迪就住这栋楼吗
<4-3,BECKETT>So Mandy lived in this building?

89
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,500
<4-4,KEVIN RYAN>是的  顶层公寓
<4-4,KEVIN RYAN>Yeah, penthouse.

90
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,990
<4-4,KEVIN RYAN>门卫今早六点前发现的尸体
<4-4,KEVIN RYAN>Doorman found her just before 6:00 this morning.

91
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,320
<4-4,KEVIN RYAN>吸毒过量吗
<4-4,KEVIN RYAN>O.D.?

92
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,090
<4-6,LANIE PARISH>鉴于她的生活方式  大家都这么以为
<4-6,LANIE PARISH>Given her lifestyle, you'd think.

93
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:07,060
<4-6,LANIE PARISH>但这是简单的老派谋杀
<4-6,LANIE PARISH>But this is plain old-fashioned murder--

94
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,180
<4-6,LANIE PARISH>脑后钝器伤
<4-6,LANIE PARISH>blunt-force trauma to the back of the head,

95
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:12,170
<4-6,LANIE PARISH>面部撕裂伤可能是倒下时造成的
<4-6,LANIE PARISH>the facial lacerations probably happened with the fall.

96
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:13,320
<4-7,BECKETT>死亡时间呢
<4-7,BECKETT>Okay, when did this happen?

97
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,140
<4-8,LANIE>尸斑表明是昨晚9点到11点
<4-8,LANIE>Lividity puts it between 9:00 and 11:00 last night.

98
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,940
<4-9,JAVIER>可以少算一小时
<4-9,JAVIER>Well, we can cut that time frame in half.

99
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,500
<4-9,JAVIER>门卫说昨晚十点
<4-9,JAVIER>Doorman said that the limo dropped her off

100
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,370
<4-9,JAVIER>豪华轿车把她送到大堂
<4-9,JAVIER>to the lobby last night at 10:00 p.m.

101
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:23,660
<4-10,BECKETT>她回家后一小时内就被杀了
<4-10,BECKETT>She was killed within an hour of returning home?

102
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,190
<4-11,CASTLE>她来这里干什么
<4-11,CASTLE>What was she doing back here?

103
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:25,890
<4-12,ESPOSITO>门卫也不知道
<4-12,ESPOSITO>Doorman didn't know.

104
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:28,010
<4-12,ESPOSITO>但他说有时她想躲避人群
<4-12,ESPOSITO>But he said that she uses that door sometimes

105
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:29,440
<4-12,ESPOSITO>就会走这扇门
<4-12,ESPOSITO>when she wants to avoid the crowd.

106
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:32,310
<4-13,CASTLE>也许她是要偷溜出去  或者约见某人
<4-13,CASTLE>So maybe she was sneaking out or meeting someone?

107
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,240
<4-14,RYAN>要真是这样  凶手可能就是她认识的人
<4-14,RYAN>If so, it was probably someone she knew.

108
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,470
<4-14,RYAN>两边的门都锁上了
<4-14,RYAN>Gates are locked on both sides.

109
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,820
<4-14,RYAN>得有密码才进得去
<4-14,RYAN>You need an access code to get in.

110
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,640
<4-15,BECKETT>有保安监控录像吗
<4-15,BECKETT>Is there any security cam footage we can pull?

111
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,610
<4-16,RYAN>这边没有
<4-16,RYAN>Not back here.

112
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,770
<4-17,CASTLE>真是讽刺  她一生都暴露在闪光灯下
<4-17,CASTLE>Ironic, seeing as how she spent her entire life

113
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:42,460
<4-17,CASTLE>却死在没有监控录像的地方
<4-17,CASTLE>in front of cameras.

114
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,750
<4-18,BECKETT>昨晚屋外有狗仔队盯着
<4-18,BECKETT>Paparazzi was out front last night.

115
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,290
<4-18,BECKETT>去看看能不能拿到他们的照片
<4-18,BECKETT>Let's see if we can get copies of their photos.

116
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:47,630
<4-18,BECKETT>凶手有可能会被拍到
<4-18,BECKETT>Whoever was behind this might've been in that crowd.

117
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,810
<4-18,BECKETT>查清情况之前
<4-18,BECKETT>And no talking to the press,

118
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:51,260
<4-18,BECKETT>不要对媒体透露任何事
<4-18,BECKETT>not until we know what's going on.

119
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,520
<4-19,KELLY JANE>她在哪里  我的天  曼迪
<4-19,KELLY JANE>Where is she? Oh, my god, Mandy!

120
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,700
<4-21,KELLY>-女士  -曼迪

<5-3,MARILYN>A lot of people disliked her, who she became,

<5-3,MARILYN>暴露的衣服  热辣的舞风
<5-3,MARILYN>her provocative clothes, and dancing.

00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,410
<5-3,MARILYN>他们只想让她永远做"曼迪·曼乐迪"
<5-3,MARILYN>They just wanted her to be little "Mandy Melody" forever.

135
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:31,110
<5-4,CASTLE>她最近有没有接到什么人的恐吓
<5-4,CASTLE>Had she received any threats recently?

136
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:33,370
<5-5,KELLY>有的  她收到过一些令人不安的信
<5-5,KELLY>Sure, she'd get some disturbing letters.

137
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:34,660
<5-5,KELLY>但侵略性太强的
<5-5,KELLY>But any that were too aggressive,

138
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,650
<5-5,KELLY>我们都移交给保安公司了
<5-5,KELLY>we'd turn over to the security firm.

00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:53,440
<5-10,KELLY>通过社会媒体和八卦网站不难了解她的行踪
<5-10,KELLY>It wasn't hard to track her on social media and gossip sites.

146
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,190
<5-10,KELLY>她这几天疯狂地参加派对
<5-10,KELLY>She was partying pretty hard.

147
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:58,110
<5-10,KELLY>过去几个月  曼迪真的很乖
<5-10,KELLY>For the past few months, Mandy'd been doing really great.

148
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:01,720
<5-11,MARILYN>上回戒毒回来之后  她再也没沾过那东西
<5-11,MARILYN>She stayed clean since her last stint in rehab.

<5-11,MARILYN>She even met a new guy

150

<5-11,MARILYN>扎克

<5-11,MARILYN>他为穷人搭建房屋
<5-11,MARILYN>He builds houses for the poor.

153
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:13,060
<5-11,MARILYN>几天之前  她去一个酒吧
<5-11,MARILYN>And then a couple nights ago, she went to a club

154
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,720
<5-11,MARILYN>参加某人的生日宴会  我猜就是那时候...
<5-11,MARILYN>for someone's birthday, and I guess...

155
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:20,660
<5-11,MARILYN>她喝多了跟前男友亲热
<5-11,MARILYN>She got drunk and she started making out with an old boyfriend.

<5-12,KELLY>-被拍了照  -所有的八卦网站都登了
<5-12,KELLY>- And someone took a picture. - It hit all the gossip sites.

<5-13,MARILYN>-扎克看到之后  -实在难以接受
<5-13,MARILYN>- When Zach saw... - It was too much for him.

158
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:30,210
<5-13,MARILYN>于是他们大吵了一架  他跟她分手了
<5-13,MARILYN>They got into a big fight, and he left her.

161
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:36,830
<5-16,CASTLE>这么说他知道怎么从楼后的小巷子
<5-16,CASTLE>Which means he would know how to access the alley

162
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,480
<5-16,CASTLE>进入你女儿的公寓
<5-16,CASTLE>behind your daughter's building.

<5-17,BECKETT>你知道去哪里能找到他吗
<5-17,BECKETT>Do you know where we could find him?

164
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:44,120
<6-1,ZACH BENTON>说来可笑  我第一次看到这张照片的时候
<6-1,ZACH BENTON>It's funny. The first time I saw this picture,

165
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,850
<6-1,ZACH BENTON>还以为再没法感觉更糟糕了
<6-1,ZACH BENTON>I didn't think I could feel any worse

166
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:48,070
<6-1,ZACH BENTON>可是...现在她居然死了
<6-1,ZACH BENTON>but... now that she's gone...

<6-2,ESPOSITO>是吗  你究竟有多难过

<6-3,ZACH>我绝不会伤害她
<6-3,ZACH>I would never hurt her.

170
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:56,750
<6-4,RYAN>那你不介意说说昨晚10点到11点
<6-4,RYAN>Then you wouldn't mind us asking where you were

171
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,070
<6-4,RYAN>你在哪里吧
<6-4,RYAN>between 10:00 and 11:00 last night.

172
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,910
<6-5,ZACH>不是我干的
<6-5,ZACH>I-I didn't do this, okay?

173
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:02,060
<6-5,ZACH>我那时在新纽泽西费尔菲尔德的一家木料场
<6-5,ZACH>I was at a lumberyard in Fairfield, New Jersey,

174
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,740
<6-5,ZACH>跟同伴一起装车
<6-5,ZACH>loading up a truck with the rest of these guys.

175
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,370
<6-5,ZACH>你可以去问问他们
<6-5,ZACH>You can--you can ask them.

176
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:06,900
<6-6,ESPOSITO>你最后一次见她是什么时候
<6-6,ESPOSITO>And the last time you saw her?

177
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,090
<6-7,ZACH>两天前我们分手的时候
<6-7,ZACH>Two days ago when I broke it off.

178
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:11,090
<6-7,ZACH>你们干嘛问我这些问题
<6-7,ZACH>Why are you asking me these questions?

179
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:13,850
<6-7,ZACH>你们怎么不去找那个被指控蓄意杀人的家伙
<6-7,ZACH>I'm not the one with the attempted manslaughter charges.

180
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:15,000
<6-8,RYAN>谁蓄意杀人
<6-8,RYAN>Manslaughter charge?

181
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,570
<6-9,ZACH>她的前男友  杰西·琼斯
<6-9,ZACH>Yeah, her ex-boyfriend, Jesse Jones--

182
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:18,590
<6-9,ZACH>就是照片里这个人
<6-9,ZACH>the one in that picture.

183
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,690
<6-9,ZACH>就是他教唆她吸毒的
<6-9,ZACH>He's the one who got her into drugs in the first place.

184
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:23,900
<6-9,ZACH>有件事曼迪没告诉任何人
<6-9,ZACH>And Mandy never told anyone this,

185
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,480
<6-9,ZACH>上次他们闹分手的时候
<6-9,ZACH>but the last time they broke up,

186
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,150
<6-9,ZACH>他曾威胁要杀了她
<6-9,ZACH>he threatened to kill her.

187
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:29,230
<7-1,BECKETT>被控使用武器
<7-1,BECKETT>Weapons charges.

188
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:31,090
<7-1,BECKETT>暴力威胁恐吓
<7-1,BECKETT>Aggravated assault.

189
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,100
<7-1,BECKETT>罪名还真够多的啊  杰西
<7-1,BECKETT>That's a hell of a resume, Jesse.

190
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,320
<7-1,BECKETT>像你这样的人怎么会勾搭上超级明星曼迪的
<7-1,BECKETT>How does someone like you hook up with a superstar like Mandy?

191
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,900
<7-2,JESSE JONES>就跟其他来找我纹身的
<7-2,JESSE JONES>Like all the other pretty little rich girls

192
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,930
<7-2,JESSE JONES>漂亮富家女一样
<7-2,JESSE JONES>that come to me for their ink.

193
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,400
<7-2,JESSE JONES>她们想要的可比纹身多得多
<7-2,JESSE JONES>She was looking for a lot more than a tattoo.

194
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,260
<7-2,JESSE JONES>我来者不拒
<7-2,JESSE JONES>I was happy to provide.

195
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:50,090
<7-3,BECKETT>我从网上知道你俩轰轰烈烈过  但结果却很难看
<7-3,BECKETT>So I read online that two of you were stormy and it didn't end well.

196
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:53,470
<7-3,BECKETT>你砸烂了她的住处  还严重恐吓过她
<7-3,BECKETT>You trashed her apartment and made some pretty serious threats.

197
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:55,470
<7-4,JESSE>都是老黄历了
<7-4,JESSE>Water under the bridge.

198
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,090
<7-5,BECKETT>两天以前  你们两个又在一起了
<7-5,BECKETT>Until two nights ago, when you guys hooked up.

199
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:58,180
<7-5,BECKETT>怎么回事
<7-5,BECKETT>How'd that happen?

200
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:01,970
<7-6,JESSE>我当时在一个酒吧  她进来了
<7-6,JESSE>I was at a bar. She came in,

201
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:04,190
<7-6,JESSE>向我投怀送抱  就跟以前一样
<7-6,JESSE>threw herself at me like old times,

202
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,490
<7-6,JESSE>我当然愿意"就范"
<7-6,JESSE>and I obliged.

203
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:07,020
<7-6,JESSE>那是我最后一次见到她
<7-6,JESSE>That was the last time I saw her.

204
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,250
<7-7,BECKETT>那你怎么解释
<7-7,BECKETT>How'd you take it

205
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:10,980
<7-7,BECKETT>在你们的照片曝光之后
<7-7,BECKETT>when right after that photo of you two appeared,

206
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:14,090
<7-7,BECKETT>她对专盯名人网说你是个人渣
<7-7,BECKETT>she told "Celebgazer" that you were... human trash...

207
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:18,740
<7-7,BECKETT>那个晚上"她犯了人生中最大的一个错误"
<7-7,BECKETT>and that that night was "The biggest mistake of her life"?

208
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,910
<7-8,JESSE>她当时看起来挺享受的
<7-8,JESSE>She seemed to like it okay at the time.

209
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,330
<7-9,BECKETT>你昨晚10点到11点在哪里
<7-9,BECKETT>Where were you last night between 10:00 and 11:00?

210
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:29,270
<7-10,JESSE>我跟朋友在皇后区的一个桌球房里
<7-10,JESSE>I was at a pool hall in Queens with some friends.

211
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:36,180
<7-11,BECKETT>名字给我
<7-11,BECKETT>Names.

212
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:41,330
<8-1,BECKETT>蕾妮  怎么了
<8-1,BECKETT>Lanie, what's going on?

213
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:44,040
<8-2,LANIE>我们这里有点小问题
<8-2,LANIE>We have a little problem here.

214
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,740
<8-3,BECKETT>什么问题
<8-3,BECKETT>So what's the problem?

215
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,520
<8-4,MARILYN>我来告诉你
<8-4,MARILYN>I'll tell you what the problem is.

216
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,820
<8-4,MARILYN>这不是我女儿
<8-4,MARILYN>That's not my daughter.

217
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,600
<8-4,MARILYN>她不是曼迪
<8-4,MARILYN>That's not Mandy.

227
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:04,350
<8-4,MARILYN>曼迪的母亲证实死者是
<8-4,MARILYN>So Mandy's mom identified our victim as...

228
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:07,770
<9-1,BECKETT>克莱尔·萨缪尔斯  25岁  一名有抱负的女演员
<9-1,BECKETT>Claire Samuels, 25. She was an aspiring actress.

229
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:10,090
<9-2,CASTLE>-她是曼迪的替身  -替身
<9-2,CASTLE>- And Mandy's decoy. - Decoy?

230
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,240
<9-3,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>用来忽悠媒体的
<9-3,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>Yeah, to fool the press.

231
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:14,820
<9-4,CASTLE>这种手段在狗仔时代已经不出奇了
<9-4,CASTLE>It's a practice not uncommon in this age of stalkerazzi.

232
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,310
<9-5,BECKETT>她打扮成曼迪的样子
<9-5,BECKETT>So she'd dress up as Mandy.

233
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,530
<9-5,BECKETT>戴上墨镜
<9-5,BECKETT>She'd put on sunglasses.

234
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,210
<9-5,BECKETT>让狗仔们跟着她
<9-5,BECKETT>She'd let the hordes follow her

235
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:21,530
<9-5,BECKETT>于是曼迪就能神不知鬼不觉地离开了
<9-5,BECKETT>so that Mandy could go about unnoticed.

236
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:23,940
<9-6,BECKETT>我们通知了克莱尔的父母  他们正在赶来
<9-6,BECKETT>Now we notified Claire's parents. They're flying in,

237
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,960
<9-6,BECKETT>埃斯波西托这会儿正在调查她的情况
<9-6,BECKETT>And Esposito's digging into her life as we speak.

238
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,780
<9-7,GATES>如果克莱尔才是死者
<9-7,GATES>So if Claire is our actual victim,

239
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,640
<9-7,GATES>那么曼迪·萨顿去哪了
<9-7,GATES>Then where's Mandy Sutton?

240
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,400
<9-8,BECKETT>我们不知道  没人见到她
<9-8,BECKETT>We don't know. No one has seen her,

241
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:34,220
<9-8,BECKETT>她也不接电话
<9-8,BECKETT>And she's not answering her phone.

242
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:36,370
<9-9,GATES>鉴于克莱尔在被害时正伪装成曼迪
<9-9,GATES>Given that Claire was pretending to be Mandy

243
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:38,330
<9-9,GATES>那我们就得考虑到这种可能性
<9-9,GATES>when she was killed, then we need to consider

244
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:40,940
<9-9,GATES>那就是曼迪·萨顿
<9-9,GATES>the very real possibility that Mandy Sutton

245
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,900
<9-9,GATES>是凶手的预定目标
<9-9,GATES>was our killer's intended target,

246
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:44,950
<9-9,GATES>他们可能正在谋划实施
<9-9,GATES>and that they might be looking to finish the job.

247
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,910
<9-10,CASTLE>可能已经得逞了  所以我们才找不到她
<9-10,CASTLE>They may already have, which is why we can't find her.

248
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:50,750
<9-11,KELLY>找到了  她在韦塞克斯酒店登记入住
<9-11,KELLY>Found her. She's checked into the Wessex Hotel

249
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,150
<9-11,KELLY>用的是她的一个化名
<9-11,KELLY>under one of her aliases.

250
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:54,310
<9-11,KELLY>但她没接房里的电话
<9-11,KELLY>But she's not answering her room phone.

251
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,720
<9-11,KELLY>敲门也没反应
<9-11,KELLY>And she's not responding to knocks on the door.

252
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:04,100
<10-1,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<10-1,BECKETT>Castle.

253
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:17,870
<10-2,BECKETT>这不是血  是红酒
<10-2,BECKETT>That's not blood. It's wine.

254
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:23,890
<10-3,MANDY SUTTON>这么早就关门啦
<10-3,MANDY SUTTON>Closing time already?

255
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,260
<10-4,MANDY>你谁啊
<10-4,MANDY>Who are you?

256
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,750
<10-4,MANDY>你说我死了  是什么意思
<10-4,MANDY>What do you mean, I'm dead?

257
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:35,070
<11-1,MANDY>克莱尔·萨缪尔斯昨晚被杀了
<11-1,MANDY>Claire Samuels was killed last night,

258
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:37,250
<11-2,BECKETT>全世界都以为那是你
<11-2,BECKETT>And the world thinks that that was you.

259
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:38,700
<11-3,MANDY>谁
<11-3,MANDY>Who?

260
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:41,200
<11-4,CASTLE>克莱尔·萨缪尔斯  她是你的替身
<11-4,CASTLE>Claire Samuels -- she's your decoy.

261
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,260
<11-5,MARILYN>我们把她装扮成你  来混淆狗仔
<11-5,MARILYN>The girl we dressed to look like you to confuse the paparazzi.

262
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:48,840
<11-6,MANDY>噢  这样啊
<11-6,MANDY>Oh. Oh, yeah, um...

263
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:50,460
<11-6,MANDY>天呐  那挺虐的
<11-6,MANDY>God, that's pretty harsh.

264
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:53,600
<11-7,BECKETT>知不知道她昨晚为什么去了你的公寓
<11-7,BECKETT>Do you know why she went to your apartment last night?

265
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,500
<11-8,MANDY>不知道  为什么这么问
<11-8,MANDY>No. Why?

266
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,000
<11-9,BECKETT>我们想搞清楚
<11-9,BECKETT>Well, I mean, we're trying to figure out

267
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:58,390
<11-9,BECKETT>她是怎么去那儿的  你母亲说
<11-9,BECKETT>how she got there, and your mom said

268
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:01,180
<11-9,BECKETT>昨天不需要她给你做替身  所以...
<11-9,BECKETT>that she wasn't scheduled to work yesterday. So...

269
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,980
<11-10,CASTLE>豪轿公司说她当晚用的车
<11-10,CASTLE>Yeah, uh, the Limo Company claims that the car

270
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,890
<11-10,CASTLE>是你订的
<11-10,CASTLE>she arrived in was ordered by you.

271
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:10,140
<11-11,MANDY>我从来没醉打过豪轿的电话  不过...
<11-11,MANDY>I've never drunk dialed a Limo before. But...

272
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,080
<11-11,MANDY>没有  不是我
<11-11,MANDY>Nope. Wasn't me.

273
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,860
<11-12,CASTLE>克莱尔呢  你打给她了吗
<11-12,CASTLE>What about Claire? Did you call her?

274
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,100
<11-13,MANDY>不  我都不认识她
<11-13,MANDY>No. I barely know her.

275
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,510
<11-14,MARILYN>我们不鼓励私下联系
<11-14,MARILYN>We discouraged personal contact.

276
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:21,920
<11-14,MARILYN>如果她们两个被看到一起出去
<11-14,MARILYN>It wouldn't make much sense to have a decoy

277
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:24,220
<11-14,MARILYN>那要替身还有什么意义呢
<11-14,MARILYN>if they're gonna be seen hanging out together.

278
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:25,610
<11-15,MANDY>我现在能躺下了吗
<11-15,MANDY>Can I lie down now?

279
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:27,770
<11-16,BECKETT>萨顿小姐  我们还有几个问题
<11-16,BECKETT>Actually, Miss Sutton, we still have a few more questions

280
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:28,900
<11-16,BECKETT>有关你的生活
<11-16,BECKETT>For you about your life.

281
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:29,950
<11-17,MANDY>我的生活
<11-17,MANDY>My life?

282
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,060
<11-18,CASTLE>我们认为你可能成为了凶手的预定目标
<11-18,CASTLE>Yeah, we think you may have been the intended target.

283
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,570
<11-18,CASTLE>好吧
<11-18,CASTLE>Oh, yeah.

284
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:38,180
<11-19,MANDY>这样就说得通了  问吧
<11-19,MANDY>That does make more sense. Okay.

285
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:42,250
<11-20,BECKETT>你知道有谁想伤害你吗
<11-20,BECKETT>So, um, do you know if anyone would have wanted to hurt you?

286
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,370
<11-20,BECKETT>你有树敌吗
<11-20,BECKETT>Do you have any enemies?

287
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:47,680
<11-21,MANDY>媒体  但是他们不会伤害我
<11-21,MANDY>The press, but... they wouldn't hurt me.

288
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,860
<11-21,MANDY>没有我  他们哪来的素材去写负面新闻
<11-21,MANDY>Without me, who would they write all those bad things about?

289
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:53,960
<11-22,BECKETT>那前两天你在外面...
<11-22,BECKETT>Okay, well, the last two days when you were out...

290
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:59,070
<11-22,BECKETT>社交的时候  跟谁吵了或者惹了谁吗
<11-22,BECKETT>socializing, did you have any fights or did you upset anyone?

291
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:01,980
<11-22,BECKETT>可能吧
<11-22,BECKETT>Probably.

292
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,980
<11-23,MANDY>我...  有点记不清细节了
<11-23,MANDY>I'm... a little hazy on the details.

293
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:10,910
<11-24,BECKETT>好吧
<11-24,BECKETT>Okay.

294
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,580
<11-25,MANDY>这就行了吧
<11-25,MANDY>Okay. That it?

295
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:14,130
<11-26,BECKETT>暂时可以了  在此期间
<11-26,BECKETT>Uh, yeah, for now. In the meantime,

296
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,700
<11-26,BECKETT>你可能得回酒店
<11-26,BECKETT>you should probably go back to the hotel and, uh,

297
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:17,840
<11-26,BECKETT>待在房里保持低调
<11-26,BECKETT>lay low in your room.

298
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,000
<11-27,MARILYN>我们不能发个声明吗
<11-27,MARILYN>Shouldn't we make an announcement?

299
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,890
<11-27,MARILYN>让大家知道她没有死
<11-27,MARILYN>Let everyone know that she isn't dead?

300
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:22,580
<11-28,BECKETT>你们得知道  如果有人想杀她
<11-28,BECKETT>Well, you know what? If someone was trying to kill her,

301
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,920
<11-28,BECKETT>让他们认为已经得手会比较安全
<11-28,BECKETT>it might be safer to let them assume

302
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,570
<11-28,BECKETT>同时我们也在抓紧破案
<11-28,BECKETT>that they've actually succeeded while we're still doing our job.

303
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:28,860
<11-29,MARILYN>需要多久  她下周要开始巡演
<11-29,MARILYN>How long? She starts a tour next week.

304
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,440
<11-29,MARILYN>作为经纪人  我难以想象
<11-29,MARILYN>And as her manager, I can't imagine that

305
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,390
<11-29,MARILYN>如果大家都认为她死了  售票会成什么样
<11-29,MARILYN>it's gonna help ticket sales if everyone thinks she's dead.

306
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:37,710
<11-30,MANDY>是啊  不想搞砸这次的复出大巡演
<11-30,MANDY>Yeah, wouldn't want to screw up the big comeback tour.

307
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:40,200
<11-31,MARILYN>亲爱的  这些新歌你下了很大功夫的
<11-31,MARILYN>Sweetie, you've worked really hard on those new songs.

308
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,750
<11-32,BECKETT>我们是说  观望一天  可能更短
<11-32,BECKETT>We're talking about staying out of sight for a day, maybe less.

309
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:46,440
<11-32,BECKETT>很可能届时我们已经找到线索
<11-32,BECKETT>Hopefully by then we'll have a lead that'll help us

310
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,080
<11-32,BECKETT>找出幕后真凶了
<11-32,BECKETT>figure out who's behind this.

311
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,490
<11-33,RYAN>贝克特
<11-33,RYAN>Uh, Beckett?

312
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:51,480
<11-33,RYAN>我找到线索了
<11-33,RYAN>I might have an idea about that.

313
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:54,060
<12-1,RYAN>粉丝来信中我们找到这封匿名信
<12-1,RYAN>We found this anonymous letter in her fan mail.

314
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,710
<12-2,BECKETT>"我盯上你了  我不喜欢我所看到的"
<12-2,BECKETT>"I'm watching you, and I don't like what I see."

315
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:59,640
<12-3,MANDY>这种人多了去了
<12-3,MANDY>Yeah, well, get in line.

316
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:02,200
<12-3,MANDY>伙计们  看看周围
<12-3,MANDY>Guys... look around.

317
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:04,710
<12-3,MANDY>我收到疯子来信  从不间断
<12-3,MANDY>I get letters from creepazoids all the time.

318
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:06,750
<12-4,RYAN>除了信以外
<12-4,RYAN>But in addition to the letter,

319
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:10,180
<12-4,RYAN>-他还附上了这些  -我的天
<12-4,RYAN>- He also included these. - Oh, my god.

320
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:13,260
<12-5,MANDY>这是我的卧室  趁我睡觉的时候
<12-5,MANDY>That's my bedroom, while I was sleeping.

321
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,960
<12-6,MARILYN>你的公寓应该是很安全的
<12-6,MARILYN>Your building is supposed to be secure.

322
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:16,110
<12-6,MARILYN>他是怎么进去的
<12-6,MARILYN>How did he get in?

323
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,450
<12-7,BECKETT>这是喷墨打印纸
<12-7,BECKETT>That's ink-jet paper.

324
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:18,820
<12-9,MANDY>所以呢
<12-9,MANDY>So?

325
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,590
<12-10,RYAN>所以我们可以追踪到
<12-10,RYAN>So we might be able to track it.

326
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:22,750
<12-12,BECKETT>-怎么追踪  -大部分的人不知道
<12-12,BECKETT>- How? - Most people don't know this,

327
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,810
<12-12,BECKETT>用于打印照片的打印机
<12-12,BECKETT>but the serial number of the printer that was used

328
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:27,420
<12-12,BECKETT>它们的序列号其实是嵌入图片的
<12-12,BECKETT>to make these photographs is actually embedded into the picture.

329
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,380
<12-13,RYAN>印成微小的小黄点
<12-13,RYAN>It's printed in tiny, little yellow dots

330
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:31,620
<12-13,RYAN>肉眼无法识别  这是联调局的技术
<12-13,RYAN>invisible to the naked eye. It's--it's an FBI thing

331
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,160
<12-13,RYAN>用于追踪伪造犯
<12-13,RYAN>Used to track counterfeiters.

332
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:35,820
<12-14,MANDY>我感觉不舒服
<12-14,MANDY>I don't feel so hot.

333
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:39,550
<12-15,CASTLE>我看有人需要喝杯咖啡
<12-15,CASTLE>You know, I-I think someone needs a cup of coffee.

334
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:46,420
<13-1,CASTLE>你四份咖啡的拿铁
<13-1,CASTLE>Here is your 4-shot latte.

335
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:48,180
<13-1,CASTLE>感觉怎么样
<13-1,CASTLE>How you feeling?

336
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,080
<13-2,MANDY>鉴于我本该死掉
<13-2,MANDY>Considering I'm supposed to be dead,

337
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,270
<13-2,MANDY>应该算不错
<13-2,MANDY>about right.

338
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:57,090
<13-4,MANDY>我只是不敢相信居然有人进了我的卧室
<13-4,MANDY>I just can't believe that freak was actually in my bedroom.

339
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:58,360
<13-4,MANDY>我们会抓到他的
<13-4,MANDY>We'll find him.

340
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,050
<13-5,CASTLE>我懂你的心情
<13-5,CASTLE>I know how tough it can be--

342
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:04,890
<13-5,CASTLE>生活事无巨细的被人窥视的压力
<13-5,CASTLE>the pressure of living your life under a microscope.

343
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:06,340
<13-5,CASTLE>我是说  我也一样
<13-5,CASTLE>I mean, I can relate.

344
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:10,150
<13-5,CASTLE>虽然没你红  但还是
<13-5,CASTLE>On a smaller scale, of course, but still, it's...

00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:13,420
<13-6,MANDY>你  你是哪位
<13-6,MANDY>Wh-who are you?

346
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:17,870
<13-7,CASTLE>比你不红太多
<13-7,CASTLE>On a much smaller scale.

347
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:20,270
<13-8,ALEXIS>-爸  你在这  -阿丽克西斯
<13-8,ALEXIS>- Dad. There you are. - Hey, Alexis.

348

<13-9,CASTLE>What are you doing he -- oh, the, uh, the letter for Pi --

349

<13-9,CASTLE>只是  我正要  我还想修改一下
<13-9,CASTLE>The -- I just, I'm about to -- I just gotta make a few tweaks.

350
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:28,070
<13-11,CASTLE>-你还没写吧  -没完  好吧  没写
<13-11,CASTLE>- You haven't written it. - Not all -- not yet.

428
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,520
<16-6,ESPOSITO>因为以前都没人

429
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,040
<16-6,ESPOSITO>关注她
<16-6,ESPOSITO>and staring at her already.

430
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:35,870
<16-7,KEN>他们不在乎她

435
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:48,270

<16-7,KEN>她  她得知道有人在看着她

00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:51,890
<16-20,KEN>没记下来  它开得太快了
<16-20,KEN>I couldn't write it down. It was going too fast.

465
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:53,380
<16-21,ESPOSITO>那骑车的人呢
<16-21,ESPOSITO>What about the rider?

466
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,830
<16-21,ESPOSITO>-你看到他的脸了吗  -他戴着头盔
<16-21,ESPOSITO>- Did you see his face? - They were wearing a helmet.

467
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:00,180
<16-22,KEN>我不知道曼迪在那儿
<16-22,KEN>I-I didn't know Mandy was back there.

468
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:03,140
<16-22,KEN>我是说  我根本没看到她出来
<16-22,KEN>I mean, I-I never saw her go back, you know?

469
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,280
<16-23,ESPOSITO>那摩托车呢
<16-23,ESPOSITO>What about the motorcycle?

470
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,720
<16-23,ESPOSITO>颜色  装饰
<16-23,ESPOSITO>Color? Trim?

471
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:07,440
<16-24,KEN>这我记得
<16-24,KEN>I wrote that down.

472
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:14,380
<16-24,KEN>是红色的  是辆红色的杜卡迪800
<16-24,KEN>It was--it was red. It was, um...it was a red Ducati 800 supersport.

473
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:18,680
<16-24,KEN>轮子是金色的  车身有火焰状的贴花
<16-24,KEN>It had gold wheels, and it had a flame decal on the body.

474
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,650
<17-1,RYAN>-你怎么看  -他是个疯子
<17-1,RYAN>- What do you think? - He's a nut job.

475
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,830
<17-2,BECKETT>但他很有可能不是凶手
<17-2,BECKETT>But he's probably not our killer.

476
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:27,860
<17-3,RYAN>是嘛  你怎么知道
<17-3,RYAN>Yeah? How's that?

477
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:30,700
<17-4,BECKETT>和狗仔不同  他知道轿车里出来的是克莱尔
<17-4,BECKETT>Unlike the paparazzi, he knew Claire was getting out of the limo.

478
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,980
<17-4,BECKETT>他能区分她俩
<17-4,BECKETT>So he can tell them apart.

479
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,500
<17-5,ESPOSITO>而他迷恋的是曼迪
<17-5,ESPOSITO>And since he's obsessed with Mandy,

480
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,130
<17-5,ESPOSITO>所以对克莱尔下手就说不通了
<17-5,ESPOSITO>there would be no reason for him to go after Claire.

481
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,080
<17-6,BECKETT>我们先扣留他
<17-6,BECKETT>We'll hold him.

482
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,860
<17-6,BECKETT>即便他不是凶手  也很可能是我们的最佳证人
<17-6,BECKETT>But if he's not our killer, he's probably our best witness.

483
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:41,160
<17-6,BECKETT>去调出这一带的交通监控录像
<17-6,BECKETT>Why don't we get ahold of traffic cam footage in the area?

484
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:43,110
<17-6,BECKETT>看能不能发现那辆杜卡迪的牌照
<17-6,BECKETT>Let's see if we can get a plate on that Ducati.

485
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:45,030
<17-7,ESPOSITO>金色车轮  车身有火焰贴花
<17-7,ESPOSITO>Gold wheels, a flame decal on the body.

486
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,120
<17-7,ESPOSITO>肯定是定制的
<17-7,ESPOSITO>It's gotta be a custom job.

487
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:48,190
<17-8,RYAN>我去查查这一带的摩托车店
<17-8,RYAN>Yeah. I'll check with bike shops in the area,

488
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:50,030
<17-8,RYAN>看能不能找到做这类装饰的地方
<17-8,RYAN>see if I can find the place that did that work.

489
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:50,820
<17-9,BECKETT>卡塞尔在哪儿
<17-9,BECKETT>Where's Castle?

490
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,460
<17-10,RYAN>他在和他另一位前妻吃饭
<17-10,RYAN>He's having dinner with his other ex-wife,

491
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:54,620
<17-10,RYAN>说不想让她感觉受冷落之类的
<17-10,RYAN>Something about not wanting her to feel left out.

492
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:58,570
<17-11,RYAN>-编得好  -他窝在休息室
<17-11,RYAN>- Good one. - He's holed up in the break room

493
00:18:58,570 --> 00:18:59,880
<17-11,RYAN>给阿丽克西斯的男友写推荐信呢
<17-11,RYAN>writing that letter for Alexis' boyfriend.

494
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,860
<17-12,BECKETT>谢谢你
<17-12,BECKETT>Thank you.

495
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,460
<18-1,ALEXIS>别担心了好嘛
<18-1,ALEXIS>Will you stop worrying?

496
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,460
<18-1,ALEXIS>他肯定会大大夸你一番的
<18-1,ALEXIS>He'll have lots of great things to say about you.

497
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,880
<18-1,ALEXIS>-我保证  -我不确定
<18-1,ALEXIS>- I guarantee it. - I don't know.

498
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,960
<18-2,PI>C先生并不怎么待见我
<18-2,PI>I'm not exactly Mr. C.'s favorate person.

499
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,020
<18-2,PI>再说这封信他确实写了很久
<18-2,PI>And he is taking an awfully long time.

500
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,390
<18-3,ALEXIS>他确实有其他事情要做
<18-3,ALEXIS>He does have other things to do, you know.

501
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:18,210
<18-4,PI>不  阿尔  我不是这个意思
<18-4,PI>No, Al, that's not what I meant.

502
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:19,840
<18-5,ALEXIS>他现在也许已经写完了
<18-5,ALEXIS>Maybe he's done by now.

503
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,810
<18-5,ALEXIS>他说写完就会给我发短信的
<18-5,ALEXIS>He said he'd text me when it was ready.

504
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:22,800
<18-5,ALEXIS>我看看
<18-5,ALEXIS>Let's see.

505
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:26,770
<18-5,ALEXIS>奇怪  我的手机关机了
<18-5,ALEXIS>That's weird. My phone's off.

506
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:32,390
<18-5,ALEXIS>这...不是我的铃声
<18-5,ALEXIS>That's...not my ring.

507
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,380
<18-6,MANDY>-喂  -你拿了我的手机
<18-6,MANDY>- Hello? - You have my phone.

508
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:37,260
<18-7,ALEXIS>曼迪  你好
<18-7,ALEXIS>Mandy? Hi.

509
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,500
<18-7,ALEXIS>对  我才发现
<18-7,ALEXIS>Uh, yeah, I just realized.

510
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,360
<18-7,ALEXIS>稀奇了  我们肯定是拿串了
<18-7,ALEXIS>Funny, we must have switched.

511
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,350
<18-8,MANDY>我要用手机  我在韦塞克斯酒店
<18-8,MANDY>I need it. I'm at the Wessex Hotel.

512
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:47,860
<18-9,ALEXIS>好  我没有故意拿你手机什么的
<18-9,ALEXIS>Okay. Sure. Oh, it's-- not like I took it on purpose or anything,

513
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:50,150
<18-9,ALEXIS>这只是个误会
<18-9,ALEXIS>just a misunderstanding.

514
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:52,470
<18-10,MANDY>房间号522
<18-10,MANDY>Room 522.

515
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,430
<18-11,ALEXIS>好 没问...
<18-11,ALEXIS>Yeah, sure. Not a...

516
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:56,230
<18-11,ALEXIS>喂
<18-11,ALEXIS>Hello?

517
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:00,610
<18-11,ALEXIS>我得去给曼迪送手机
<18-11,ALEXIS>I guess I'm bringing Mandy her phone.

518
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:01,500
<18-12,PI>我得去上城区
<18-12,PI>I-I gotta head uptown.

519
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,410
<18-12,PI>出现蜂蛹了  那我们回见
<18-12,PI>The bee pupae are emerging. See you later?

520
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,070
<19-1,MANDY>-好  再见  -再见
<19-1,MANDY>- Okay. Bye. - Bye. Oh!

521
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,870
<19-2,ALEXIS>嗨  你的手机
<19-2,ALEXIS>Hey, so, uh...here's your phone.

522
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:25,600
<19-3,ALEXIS>听着  我很抱歉之前说你"不可救药"
<19-3,ALEXIS>Look, I'm sorry about that whole "Hot mess" thing I said before.

523
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,550
<19-4,MANDY>抱歉你那么说了  还是抱歉被我听到了
<19-4,MANDY>Sorry that you said it, or sorry that I heard it?

524
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:32,500
<19-5,ALEXIS>我...可能该走了
<19-5,ALEXIS>I... should probably go.

525
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,580
<19-6,MANDY>你不注意的时候就会改变
<19-6,MANDY>It happens when you're not looking.

526
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,870
<19-7,ALEXIS>什么
<19-7,ALEXIS>Excuse me?

527
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,670
<19-8,MANDY>之前  你问起怎么会改变
<19-8,MANDY>Before... you asked how it happens--

528
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:42,410
<19-8,MANDY>怎么会变成我现在这样
<19-8,MANDY>how someone becomes like me.

529
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:44,880
<19-8,MANDY>不注意的时候就会改变
<19-8,MANDY>It happens when you're not looking,

530
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,970
<19-8,MANDY>等意识到的时候  就已经变成现在的样子了
<19-8,MANDY>And by the time you realize it, it's already who you are.

531
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,610
<19-8,MANDY>就好比路边发生了车祸
<19-8,MANDY>Like the car crash on the side of the road

532
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:53,290
<19-8,MANDY>所有人都停下来...观望
<19-8,MANDY>everybody stops and-- and watches.

533
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,190
<19-9,ALEXIS>这并不代表你非得变成这样
<19-9,ALEXIS>That doesn't mean it's who you have to be.

534
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:58,460
<19-9,ALEXIS>你总能改头换面的
<19-9,ALEXIS>You can always change.

535
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:01,280
<19-10,MANDY>事实证明我并不擅长改头换面
<19-10,MANDY>Turns out I don't do change so well.

536
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:05,930
<19-10,MANDY>但如果你要偷警车  要放火把它烧着的话
<19-10,MANDY>But...you steal a police car and you set it on fire

537
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:07,280
<19-10,MANDY>我是绝佳人选
<19-10,MANDY>I'm your girl.

538
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:11,040
<19-10,MANDY>或者找到世界上最好的男生
<19-10,MANDY>Or if you find the greatest guy in the world,

539
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,960
<19-10,MANDY>疯狂地相爱
<19-10,MANDY>Fall madly in love,

540
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:16,570
<19-10,MANDY>然后和我的人渣前任勾搭  把一切搞砸
<19-10,MANDY>and then mess it up by hooking up with my dirtbag ex?

541
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,060
<19-10,MANDY>这都是我能做出的事情
<19-10,MANDY>That I can do.

542
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:22,630
<19-11,ALEXIS>对  我在网上看见照片了
<19-11,ALEXIS>Yeah, I... saw that picture online.

543
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:25,760
<19-12,MANDY>全世界都看到了
<19-12,MANDY>You and the rest of the world.

544
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:28,470
<19-13,ALEXIS>或许如果你戒酒的话
<19-13,ALEXIS>Maybe if you didn't drink.

545
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:32,020
<19-14,MANDY>如果我戒酒  我就会有感受
<19-14,MANDY>If I don't drink, then I start to feel.

546
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,290
<19-14,MANDY>我不喜欢我感受到的
<19-14,MANDY>And I don't like what I feel.

547
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:40,860
<19-14,MANDY>我希望我有个"曼迪·曼乐迪"里的眼镜
<19-14,MANDY>I wish I had those glasses from "Mandy Melody".

548
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:43,600
<19-14,MANDY>我戴上它们  然后
<19-14,MANDY>I'd just put 'em on and...

549
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,840
<19-14,MANDY>就消失了
<19-14,MANDY>Just disappear.

550
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,650
<19-15,ALEXIS>我理解你的感受
<19-15,ALEXIS>I know how you feel.

551
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:55,680
<19-16,MANDY>你怎么可能会理解我的感受
<19-16,MANDY>How could you possibly know how feel?

552
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,900
<19-17,ALEXIS>因为现在  我
<19-17,ALEXIS>Because right now, I...

553
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,590
<19-17,ALEXIS>也希望可以从我的生活中消失
<19-17,ALEXIS>wish I could disappear from my life, too.

554
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,700
<20-1,BECKETT>好的  谢谢  我回头会确认的
<20-1,BECKETT>Okay, thanks. I'll check back.

555
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,220
<20-1,BECKETT>派的推荐信写的怎么样了
<20-1,BECKETT>So how's Pi's recommendation going?

556
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,010
<20-2,CASTLE>写德里克·斯道姆小说都比这个好写
<20-2,CASTLE>It took me less time to write the last derrick storm novel.

557
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:17,430
<20-2,CASTLE>即使他们都是虚构的
<20-2,CASTLE>And although they both are works of fiction,

558
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:19,240
<20-2,CASTLE>至少那个有可信度
<20-2,CASTLE>at least that one was believable.

559
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,130
<20-2,CASTLE>案子进展的怎么样了
<20-2,CASTLE>How's the case coming?

560
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,650
<20-3,BECKETT>我们得到了从犯罪现场离开的
<20-3,BECKETT>Well, we got a description of the motorcycle

561
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:23,390
<20-3,BECKETT>那辆摩托车的描述  科技处正试着
<20-3,BECKETT>that left the crime scene, and tech's trying to

562
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:25,280
<20-3,BECKETT>从交通摄像头录像里找到车牌号
<20-3,BECKETT>get a plate off of traffic cam footage,

563
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,500
<20-3,BECKETT>但至今还一无所获
<20-3,BECKETT>but so far no luck.

564
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,190
<20-4,ESPOSITO>有收获了  我们找到那个混蛋了
<20-4,ESPOSITO>Our luck just changed. We got the son of a bitch.

565
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,740
<21-1,ESPOSITO>我们找到一家商店订制了
<21-1,ESPOSITO>We found a shop that outfitted

566
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:33,280
<21-1,ESPOSITO>一辆带有金色轮子和火焰贴花的
<21-1,ESPOSITO>a red ducati 800 with gold wheels

567
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,170
<21-1,ESPOSITO>红色杜卡迪800给一个叫乔什·格林伯格的人
<21-1,ESPOSITO>and a flame decal for one Josh Greenberg.

568
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:37,360
<21-2,BECKETT>这就是我们要找的人吗
<21-2,BECKETT>Is that our guy?

569
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,140
<21-3,RYAN>乔什·格林伯格有点儿资金周转问题
<21-3,RYAN>Josh Greenberg had a slight liquidity problem.

570
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:42,850
<21-3,RYAN>所以他三天前把摩托卖了
<21-3,RYAN>So he sold that bike three days ago for cash

571
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:43,820
<21-3,RYAN>卖给了
<21-3,RYAN>To...

572
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:45,360
<21-3,RYAN>这个人
<21-3,RYAN>This guy.

573
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,120
<21-4,CASTLE>杰西·琼斯  曼迪的前男友
<21-4,CASTLE>Jesse Jones--Mandy's ex.

574
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,030
<21-5,BECKETT>所以他对我们撒谎了  他在那个小巷里
<21-5,BECKETT>So he lied to us. He was in that alley.

575
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:49,870
<21-5,BECKETT>好了  把他带进来问话
<21-5,BECKETT>All right. Bring him in.

576
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:52,090
<21-6,RYAN>我们已经派人去他家了
<21-6,RYAN>We already sent a car over to his place.

577
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:54,540
<21-7,ESPOSITO>他不在那儿  曼迪应该能帮上忙
<21-7,ESPOSITO>He's not there. Mandy might be able to help out.

578
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:55,920
<21-7,ESPOSITO>她或许知道他常去的地方
<21-7,ESPOSITO>She probably knows his hangouts.

579
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,940
<21-8,BECKETT>好的  去吧
<21-8,BECKETT>All right, go.

580
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,170
<22-1,ALEXIS>我和我男朋友的问题是
<22-1,ALEXIS>The thing about my boyfriend is...

581
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,000
<22-1,ALEXIS>我以为我成熟了
<22-1,ALEXIS>I thought I was being so grown-up--

582
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,780
<22-1,ALEXIS>和他同居  租套房子
<22-1,ALEXIS>moving in with him, getting my own place.

583
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,790
<22-1,ALEXIS>但现在这是我生活的一切了
<22-1,ALEXIS>But now it's my whole life.

584
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:08,280
<22-1,ALEXIS>我很确定我犯了一个巨大的错误
<22-1,ALEXIS>And I'm pretty sure I've made a huge mistake.

585
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:11,320
<22-1,ALEXIS>你知道我为什么要帮他申请经费
<22-1,ALEXIS>Do you know why I'm helping him with his grant application?

586
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,870
<22-1,ALEXIS>因为如果他得到了  他就要去旅行
<22-1,ALEXIS>Because if he gets it, he'll have to travel.

587
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:16,520
<22-2,MANDY>那太糟了  你得告诉他
<22-2,MANDY>That is messed up. You need to tell him.

588
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,510
<22-3,ALEXIS>告诉他什么
<22-3,ALEXIS>Tell him what?

589
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:20,100
<22-3,ALEXIS>说我改变主意了  说我想分手
<22-3,ALEXIS>That I changed my mind? I don't want a relationship?

590
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,460
<22-3,ALEXIS>我们是有租约的
<22-3,ALEXIS>We have a lease.

591
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,350
<22-4,MANDY>那真是太浪漫了
<22-4,MANDY>That's romantic.

592
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:25,040
<22-5,ALEXIS>而且这样对他太不公平了
<22-5,ALEXIS>And he doesn't deserve it.

593
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,970
<22-5,ALEXIS>他什么都没有做错
<22-5,ALEXIS>He hasn't done anything wrong.

594
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:28,510
<22-5,ALEXIS>哦对  还有我老爸
<22-5,ALEXIS>Oh! And then there's my dad.

595
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,910
<22-5,ALEXIS>我怎么跟他说
<22-5,ALEXIS>What do I tell him, huh?

596
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:31,680
<22-5,ALEXIS>说他从头到尾都是对的
<22-5,ALEXIS>That he was right all along,

597
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,190
<22-6,MANDY>我没有准备好
<22-6,MANDY>That I wasn't ready?

598
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,680
<22-6,MANDY>我倒是希望我那样说过
<22-6,MANDY>I wish I would have said that.

599
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,630
<22-6,MANDY>我没做好准备的事情多了去了
<22-6,MANDY>I wasn't ready for many things.

600
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:40,550
<22-7,ALEXIS>你没有回想过你自己做过的事情
<22-7,ALEXIS>Do you ever look back on something you've done

601
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:42,960
<22-7,ALEXIS>然后  觉得像是别人做的
<22-7,ALEXIS>and... it's like someone else is doing it?

602
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:44,690
<22-8,MANDY>你在开玩笑  对吧
<22-8,MANDY>You're kidding, right?

603
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:46,600
<22-8,MANDY>也是
<22-8,MANDY>Right.

604
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:49,260
<22-9,ALEXIS>对不起  我
<22-9,ALEXIS>Sorry, I...

605
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,780
<22-9,ALEXIS>没有可以谈心的人
<22-9,ALEXIS>haven't had anyone to talk to.

606
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,560
<22-10,MANDY>很明显
<22-10,MANDY>Clearly.

607
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:56,800
<22-11,MANDY>"做真实的自己"
<22-11,MANDY>"Be true to yourself."

608
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,930
<22-11,MANDY>扎克会这么跟你说
<22-11,MANDY>That's what Zach would say.

609
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,990
<22-11,MANDY>而且如果情况对你不利
<22-11,MANDY>And if a situation is bad for you,

610
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:04,430
<22-11,MANDY>就别管了  我们一般都会这样做
<22-11,MANDY>Leave it. That's what we were going to do.

611
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:06,200
<22-11,MANDY>也是你应该做的
<22-11,MANDY>And that's what you should do, too.

612
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,200
<22-12,ALEXIS>曼迪  有人给你发短信了吗
<22-12,ALEXIS>Mandy, is someone texting you?

613
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,100
<22-12,ALEXIS>奇怪  我应该已经死了
<22-12,ALEXIS>Weird, since I'm supposed to be dead.

614
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:17,480
<22-13,MANDY>是我的朋友萨姆
<22-13,MANDY>Oh, it's my friend Sam.

615
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,280
<22-13,MANDY>"非常确定你没有死
<22-13,MANDY>"Pretty sure you're not dead.

616
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:21,040
<22-13,MANDY>需要跟你说说死了的女孩
<22-13,MANDY>Need to talk about girl who died.

617
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,610
<22-13,MANDY>有些事情你需要知道
<22-13,MANDY>Something you need to know"?

618
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,040
<22-14,ALEXIS>等等  你在干什么
<22-14,ALEXIS>Wait, what-- what are you doing?

619
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,290
<22-15,MANDY>打给他  但你现在保持低调
<22-15,MANDY>Calling him? But you're supposed to be laying low.

620
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:29,800
<22-16,ALEXIS>没人应该知道你还活着
<22-16,ALEXIS>No one's supposed to know you're alive.

621
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,140
<22-17,MANDY>他已经知道我还活着了
<22-17,MANDY>He already knows I'm alive.

622
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,440
<22-18,ALEXIS>他以为你还活着
<22-18,ALEXIS>He thinks you're alive.

623
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:33,830
<22-18,ALEXIS>也许他只是想确认一下呢
<22-18,ALEXIS>He might be trying to find out for sure.

624
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:35,480
<22-18,ALEXIS>而且万一这不是萨姆
<22-18,ALEXIS>And what if it's not Sam?

625
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,310
<22-18,ALEXIS>也有可能是杀手想引蛇出洞
<22-18,ALEXIS>It could be the killer trying to lure you out.

626
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:40,380
<22-19,MANDY>别紧张  这是萨姆的号码  好吗
<22-19,MANDY>Would you relax? It's Sam's number, okay?

627
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,090
<22-19,MANDY>他没有接
<22-19,MANDY>And he's not answering,

628
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:43,180
<22-19,MANDY>说明他有可能在调酒
<22-19,MANDY>which means he's probably bartending.

629
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,270
<22-19,MANDY>他工作的地方很吵
<22-19,MANDY>That place he works is really loud.

630
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,670
<22-19,MANDY>我要去见他
<22-19,MANDY>I have to go see him.

631
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,100
<22-20,ALEXIS>你不能出去  万一被人看见怎么办
<22-20,ALEXIS>You can't go out. What if someone sees you?

632
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,530
<22-20,ALEXIS>你还是不明白  对吧
<22-20,ALEXIS>You don't get it, do you?

633
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:54,250
<22-21,MANDY>本该我死
<22-21,MANDY>I am the one that is supposed to be dead,

634
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:57,460
<22-21,MANDY>而不是克莱尔  她是因我而死
<22-21,MANDY>Not Claire. She died because of me.

635
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:59,290
<22-21,MANDY>我知道人们以为我不关心
<22-21,MANDY>And I know that people think that I don't care,

636
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:00,920
<22-21,MANDY>但我不是怪物
<22-21,MANDY>But I'm not a monster.

637
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,940
<22-21,MANDY>如果萨姆知道克莱尔之死的内情
<22-21,MANDY>If Sam has information about Claire's death,

638
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,500
<22-21,MANDY>我要知道那是什么
<22-21,MANDY>I need to know what it is.

639
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,470
<22-21,MANDY>我只是想做件正确的事
<22-21,MANDY>I just want to do one thing right.

640
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:10,750
<22-21,MANDY>曼迪
<22-21,MANDY>Mandy!

641
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:13,180
<22-22,ALEXIS>你不应该这样做
<22-22,ALEXIS>You shouldn't be doing this.

642
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:15,170
<22-23,MANDY>你阻止不了我
<22-23,MANDY>Yeah, well, you're not gonna stop me.

643
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:16,600
<22-24,ALEXIS>如果你执意要去
<22-24,ALEXIS>Okay, but if you're going to do it,

644
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:18,000
<22-24,ALEXIS>你不能被认出来
<22-24,ALEXIS>You can't be recognized.

645
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,310
<22-24,ALEXIS>懂了吗  你需要个人
<22-24,ALEXIS>Do you understand? You're going to need someone

646
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,640
<22-24,ALEXIS>帮你跟人说话
<22-24,ALEXIS>to do all the talking for you.

647
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:24,260
<22-24,ALEXIS>走吧
<22-24,ALEXIS>Come on.

648
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:35,750
<23-1,BECKETT>曼迪不见了  去哪儿了
<23-1,BECKETT>Mandy's gone?! Gone where?

649
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:36,550
<23-1,BECKETT>还不知道
<23-1,BECKETT>We're not sure.

650
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:38,360
<23-2,RYAN>前台的人没看见她走
<23-2,RYAN>No one at the front desk saw her leave.

651
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,270
<23-3,BECKETT>有打斗挣扎的痕迹吗
<23-3,BECKETT>Are there any signs of foul play?

652
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,160
<23-4,ESPOSITO>没有  看起来她是自己离开的
<23-4,ESPOSITO>Nah, it looks like she just took off.

653
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:44,800
<23-5,RYAN>说不定她又继续去寻欢作乐了
<23-5,RYAN>Maybe she, uh, picked up where she left off on that bender.

654
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,740
<23-6,BECKETT>你们赶紧回来
<23-6,BECKETT>You guys gotta come back.

655
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:46,820
<23-6,BECKETT>我们得组织搜寻行动
<23-6,BECKETT>We have to coordinate a search.

656
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:47,820
<23-7,ESPOSITO>我们去问问轿车公司
<23-7,ESPOSITO>We'll check with the limo company,

657
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:48,860
<23-7,ESPOSITO>看她有没有叫车来接她
<23-7,ESPOSITO>see if she called for a pickup.

658
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:49,570
<23-8,BECKETT>我去问问她妈
<23-8,BECKETT>And I'll talk to her mom.

659
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:51,680
<23-8,BECKETT>我会列一张清单写明她平时喜欢去的地方
<23-8,BECKETT>I'll get a list of all the places she likes to go to.

660
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:54,220
<23-8,BECKETT>我们得在杰西发现自己杀错人之前
<23-8,BECKETT>We have to find her before Jesse figures out

661
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:55,850
<23-8,BECKETT>找到她
<23-8,BECKETT>that he killed the wrong person.

662
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:57,790
<23-9,MARILYN>怎么了
<23-9,MARILYN>What?

663
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,220
<23-9,MARILYN>发生什么事了
<23-9,MARILYN>What happened?

664
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,380
<23-9,MARILYN>曼迪呢
<23-9,MARILYN>Where's Mandy?

665
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:06,580
<24-1,ALEXIS>你确定你真的要这样做
<24-1,ALEXIS>Are you sure I can't talk you out of this?

<24-2,MANDY>他在那儿  那就是萨姆
<24-2,MANDY>There he is. There's sam.

<24-3,ALEXIS>我来这就是为了帮你去叫他
<24-3,ALEXIS>That's what I'm here for.

<24-2,MANDY>萨姆
<24-2,MANDY>Sam!

670
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:16,960
<24-3,ALEXIS>嘿  萨姆
<24-3,ALEXIS>Hey, sam!

671
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,390
<24-4,MANDY>这样可是行不通的  小红发
<24-4,MANDY>That's not gonna get the job done there, Red.

672
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,460
<24-4,MANDY>你得脱几件衣服
<24-4,MANDY>You want to lose some layers?

673
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:26,960
<24-4,MANDY>把那种祖母戴的围巾给脱了
<24-4,MANDY>Take off Grandma's scarf.

674
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,570
<24-5,ALEXIS>我还有个主意
<24-5,ALEXIS>I have something else in mind.

675
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:33,800
<24-5,ALEXIS>然后她就问"你能相信吗"
<24-5,ALEXIS>So she was like, "Can you believe it?"

676
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,910
<24-5,ALEXIS>然后我就说"不可能"
<24-5,ALEXIS>And I was like, "No way."

677
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:38,170
<24-6,ALEXIS>真对不起
<24-6,ALEXIS>I am so sorry.

00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,620
<24-18,SAM>她想要她的私人电话
<24-18,SAM>She wanted her private number.

705
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,180
<24-20,SAM>-为什么  -她找你是因为
<24-20,SAM>- What for? - She was trying to reach you because

706
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,960
<24-20,SAM>她觉得有人要伤害你
<24-20,SAM>she thought somebody was trying to hurt you.

707

<24-21,MANDY>谁
<24-21,MANDY>Who?

708

<24-22,SAM>She didn't say, but she got way mad

709
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:41,110
<24-22,SAM>就变得很激动
<24-22,SAM>when I wouldn't give her your number.

710
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,460
<24-22,SAM>我还以为这女孩疯了
<24-22,SAM>Yeah, I... man, I thought this girl was nuts--

711
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:45,310
<24-22,SAM>像那种疯狂的粉丝之类的
<24-22,SAM>you know, a crazy fan or something.

712
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,660
<24-22,SAM>然后她就问我怎么联系杰西
<24-22,SAM>Then she asked me how she can get in touch with Jesse.

713
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:49,480
<24-23,MANDY>杰西  他和这事有什么关系
<24-23,MANDY>Jesse? What does he have to do with this?

714
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,690
<24-24,SAM>我不知道  但…
<24-24,SAM>I don't know, but...

715
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:52,460
<24-24,SAM>她也很想跟杰西谈谈
<24-24,SAM>She was pretty hot to talk to him, too.

716
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:54,990
<24-24,SAM>所以我就打给杰西  让他们谈了
<24-24,SAM>So I called jesse, and I put him on with her.

717
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,420
<24-25,ALEXIS>她说什么了
<24-25,ALEXIS>What'd she say?

718
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:59,530
<24-26,SAM>我没听见  但她很不安
<24-26,SAM>I didn't hear, but she was pretty upset.

719
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:02,240
<24-26,SAM>后来她死了  所以我以为你该知道
<24-26,SAM>And since she ended up dead, I thought you should know.

720
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,320
<24-26,SAM>萨姆
<24-26,SAM>Hey, sam!

00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:09,050
<24-27,SAM>那儿有人渴了
<24-27,SAM>People gettin' thirsty over there.

723
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,720
<24-28,ALEXIS>我不明白  克莱尔认识杰西吗
<24-28,ALEXIS>I don't get it. Did Claire know jesse?

724
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,580
<24-29,MANDY>不知道  我以为不认识
<24-29,MANDY>I don't know. I didn't think she did.

725
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:15,100
<24-29,MANDY>要弄明白只有一个办法
<24-29,MANDY>There's only one way to find out.

726
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,440
<24-29,MANDY>我要打给杰西
<24-29,MANDY>I'm calling Jesse.

727
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,780
<24-30,ALEXIS>等等  他可能参与了这事
<24-30,ALEXIS>Wait. He could be involved.

728
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,710
<24-30,ALEXIS>而且如果克莱尔觉得有人想杀你
<24-30,ALEXIS>And if Claire thought someone was trying to kill you,

729
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:21,270
<24-30,ALEXIS>打电话给他真的…
<24-30,ALEXIS>do you really think it's a good idea to call--

730
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:22,240
<24-30,ALEXIS>有人跟你朋友说过
<24-30,ALEXIS>Anybody ever tell your friend

00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:04,840
<30-16,MANDY>那晚我醉得一塌糊涂  什么都不记得
<30-16,MANDY>I was messed up that night. I don't remember anything.

799
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:07,390
<30-16,MANDY>甚至不记得我是怎么喝醉的
<30-16,MANDY>I don't even remember getting messed up.

800
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:08,520
<30-17,ALEXIS>也许你不是喝醉
<30-17,ALEXIS>Maybe you didn't.

801
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:10,950
<30-17,ALEXIS>也许是有人给你下药  所以你没有记忆
<30-17,ALEXIS>Maybe somebody drugged you so you wouldn't remember.

802
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:12,620
<30-18,MANDY>然后让我看见照片
<30-18,MANDY>And then I-I would see the photos

803
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:15,240
<30-18,MANDY>以为那是我自己吗  杰西
<30-18,MANDY>and assume that it was me? Jesse...

804
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,570
<30-18,MANDY>你怎么能这样对我
<30-18,MANDY>How could you do that to me?

805
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:19,110
<30-19,JESSE>这跟你没关系  不再有关系了
<30-19,JESSE>This isn't about you, not anymore.

806
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:20,820
<30-19,JESSE>到底出了什么事  曼迪
<30-19,JESSE>What happened, Mandy?

807
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:23,270
<30-19,JESSE>谁杀了克莱尔
<30-19,JESSE>Who killed Claire?

808
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,080
<30-19,JESSE>我不知道
<30-19,JESSE>I don't know.

809
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:27,380
<30-20,MANDY>你这么关心是为什么
<30-20,MANDY>What do you care?

810
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:29,680
<30-21,JESSE>我关心是因为警察想把这事扣在我头上
<30-21,JESSE>I care 'cause the cops are trying to pin it on me.

811
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:33,140
<30-21,JESSE>那天晚上一定有人在巷子里看到我
<30-21,JESSE>Someone must have seen me in the alley that night.

812
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:34,870
<30-22,MANDY>等等  你在现场
<30-22,MANDY>Wait a minute. You were there,

813
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:38,070
<30-22,MANDY>-她被杀的时候  -我得跟她谈谈
<30-22,MANDY>- when she was killed? - I had to talk to her.

814
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:40,540
<30-23,JESSE>现在我们本该收到余下的2万5千块钱
<30-23,JESSE>Now we were supposed to get another 25 grand

815
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:42,020
<30-23,JESSE>只要照片登出来的时候
<30-23,JESSE>for staging that photo,

816
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:43,870
<30-23,JESSE>我们没有做任何动作
<30-23,JESSE>if we kept our mouth shut when the story ran.

817
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,460
<30-23,JESSE>都怪那婊子突然良心发现  对这一切
<30-23,JESSE>Only bitch got a conscience, felt bad about everything

818
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:48,310
<30-23,JESSE>都感到内疚  特别是那张照片
<30-23,JESSE>she had done, especially 'cause the pictures

819
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:50,730
<30-23,JESSE>害你和那个叫扎克分手了
<30-23,JESSE>broke up you and what's his name--Zach.

820
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:53,050
<30-23,JESSE>她非得去补救这一切
<30-23,JESSE>She just had to set things right.

821
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:55,320
<30-24,ALEXIS>这就是昨晚她想找你谈谈的原因
<30-24,ALEXIS>That's why she was trying to get in touch with you last night.

822
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,710
<30-25,JESSE>她打电话给我  说她要去你家
<30-25,JESSE>She called me and said she was going over to your place

823
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:59,230
<30-25,JESSE>把一切都告诉你
<30-25,JESSE>to tell you everything.

824
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:01,080
<30-25,JESSE>这代表我就拿不到余款了
<30-25,JESSE>Only that means I'm not gonna get my money.

825
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:03,050
<30-25,JESSE>所以我去找她谈话  希望能阻止她
<30-25,JESSE>So I go over there to talk her out of it,

826
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:03,970
<30-25,JESSE>就是这样
<30-25,JESSE>that's it!

827
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:07,280
<30-25,JESSE>我到那里的时候  她已经死了
<30-25,JESSE>And when I get there, she's dead.

828
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:09,960
<30-26,ALEXIS>杰西  如果你没杀克莱尔
<30-26,ALEXIS>Jesse, if you didn't kill Claire,

829
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:11,160
<30-26,ALEXIS>那就把枪放下
<30-26,ALEXIS>Then put the gun down.

830
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,030
<30-26,ALEXIS>我们可以一起去警局  把事情查清楚
<30-26,ALEXIS>We can go tohe police together and figure this out.

831
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:14,620
<30-27,JESSE>-我保证...  -你想唬弄我
<30-27,JESSE>- I promise... - You're trying to confuse me!

832
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:16,480
<30-27,JESSE>在我伤害你之前  把嘴闭上
<30-27,JESSE>Now shut up before I do something I--

833
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,180
<30-27,JESSE>马上转身  杰西
<30-27,JESSE>Turn around right now, Jesse!

834
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,380
<30-28,ESPOSITO>把枪放下  杰西
<30-28,ESPOSITO>Drop that gun, Jesse!

835
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:21,860
<30-29,RYAN>手  把手举起来
<30-29,RYAN>Show 'em! Show your hands!

836
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,360
<30-29,RYAN>蹲下  马上
<30-29,RYAN>Down! Now, now!

837
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,440
<30-30,ALEXIS>爸爸
<30-30,ALEXIS>Dad.

838
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:29,520
<30-31,CASTLE>没事了  都结束了
<30-31,CASTLE>It's okay. It's over.

839
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:41,860
<31-1,CASTLE>如果杰西说的是实话  克莱尔是因为要
<31-1,CASTLE>If Jesse's story is true, then Claire was about to reveal

840
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:44,180
<31-1,CASTLE>戳穿照片是伪造的而被人谋杀
<31-1,CASTLE>that those photos were fake and someone killed her for it.

841
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,200
<31-2,BECKETT>也许克莱尔·萨缪尔斯
<31-2,BECKETT>So maybe Claire Samuels

842
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,640
<31-2,BECKETT>就是凶手的目标
<31-2,BECKETT>was the intended target after all.

843
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:53,360
<31-2,BECKETT>如果杰西说的是实话  悬
<31-2,BECKETT>If Jesse's story is true. That's a big "if."

844
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:54,980
<31-2,BECKETT>好的  谢谢  比尔
<31-2,BECKETT>All right, thanks, Bill.

845
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:57,580
<32-1,ESPOSITO>杰西这部分的话被证实是真的
<32-1,ESPOSITO>So Jesse was telling the truth about this much--

846
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:59,480
<32-1,ESPOSITO>五天前  他的确
<32-1,ESPOSITO>he deposited $25,000 cash

847
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,060
<32-1,ESPOSITO>往银行里存了2万5千块现金
<32-1,ESPOSITO>in his bank account five days ago.

848
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:02,310
<32-2,BECKETT>关于付钱的人有发现吗
<32-2,BECKETT>Any more on who paid him?

849
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:04,090
<32-3,RYAN>没有  我们找到一张打印的纸条
<32-3,RYAN>No, we got a typewritten note

850
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:05,720
<32-3,RYAN>写着什么时候去酒吧见克莱尔
<32-3,RYAN>that told him when to meet Claire at the bar

851
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,450
<32-3,RYAN>以及进行交易的秘密地点
<32-3,RYAN>and where to find the money at a dead drop.

852
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:08,870
<32-4,CASTLE>为什么会有人愿意付那么多钱
<32-4,CASTLE>Why would someone pay that much money

853
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:10,240
<32-4,CASTLE>来伪造这样一张照片
<32-4,CASTLE>to stage a photo in the first place?

854
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,400
<32-5,BECKETT>又是为什么这张照片如此重要
<32-5,BECKETT>And what was so important about it

855
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,450
<32-5,BECKETT>以至于有人竟然灭口克莱尔
<32-5,BECKETT>that someone would kill Claire

856
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:15,470
<32-5,BECKETT>以免被戳穿照片的真实性
<32-5,BECKETT>in order to keep it from being exposed as a fake?

857
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,100
<32-5,BECKETT>我不知道
<32-5,BECKETT>I don't know,

858
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:18,130
<32-6,CASTLE>但我知道有可能知情的人是谁
<32-6,CASTLE>but I could think of someone who might.

859
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:19,160
<32-6,CASTLE>各位  杰西有说
<32-6,CASTLE>Guys, did Jesse tell you

860
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,810
<32-6,CASTLE>照片是在夜店哪个位置被拍下的吗
<32-6,CASTLE>where in the club that photo was taken?

861
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:22,550
<32-7,ESPOSITO>内部闭路电视盲区
<32-7,ESPOSITO>Somewhere in the back hidden from view.

862
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,680
<32-7,ESPOSITO>为了保证没有目击者  不然早就流传出去了
<32-7,ESPOSITO>Couldn't be any witnesses, or the gag wouldn't work.

863
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:27,210
<32-8,BECKETT>所以那个拍照的人不是碰巧在那
<32-8,BECKETT>So that photographer didn't just happen to be there.

864
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,860
<32-8,BECKETT>他跟他们是一伙儿的
<32-8,BECKETT>He was in on it.

865
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,350
<32-9,CASTLE>拍照的人是谁
<32-9,CASTLE>So who's the photographer?

866
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,310
<33-1,ESPOSITO>詹姆斯·洛克哈特  你好啊
<33-1,ESPOSITO>James Lockhart. How you doin'?

867
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,450
<33-1,ESPOSITO>纽约警局  我们要问你几个问题  老兄
<33-1,ESPOSITO>N.Y.P.D. We gotta ask you some questions, bro.

868
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:38,110
<33-2,JAMES LOCKHART>你俩能晚点再来吗
<33-2,JAMES LOCKHART>Listen, can you guys come back a little later?

869
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:39,050
<33-3,RYAN>你说什么
<33-3,RYAN>Excuse me?

870
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:41,230
<33-4,JAMES>有个女演员在咖啡店里  瑞丝·威灵福特
<33-4,JAMES>There's an actress in this cafe, Reese Wellingford?

871
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:43,150
<33-4,JAMES>我等了一个小时就为了等她出来
<33-4,JAMES>I've been waiting an hour for her to come out.

872
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:45,380
<33-5,ESPOSITO>这可是刑事侦查  笨蛋
<33-5,ESPOSITO>Listen, fool, this is a criminal investigation.

873
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:46,040
<33-5,ESPOSITO>你卖给专盯名人网的那些照片
<33-5,ESPOSITO>Who paid you to take those pictures

874
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,630
<33-5,ESPOSITO>是谁雇你拍的
<33-5,ESPOSITO>you sold to "Celebgazer"?

875
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:48,640
<33-6,RYAN>就是那张杰西·琼斯
<33-6,RYAN>The ones with Jesse Jones

876
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:50,270
<33-6,RYAN>和假曼迪·萨顿的合照
<33-6,RYAN>and the girl who wasn't Mandy Sutton?

877
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:51,300
<33-7,JAMES>没人雇我拍
<33-7,JAMES>Nobody paid me.

878
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:53,450
<33-8,ESPOSITO>你是说  他俩在酒吧后边亲热的时候
<33-8,ESPOSITO>Oh, really? So you just ended up in that backroom

879
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:55,330
<33-8,ESPOSITO>你只是刚好在那  是吗
<33-8,ESPOSITO>in that bar when those two hooked up?

880
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:57,320
<33-9,JAMES>是的  纯粹走运而已  她出来了
<33-9,JAMES>Yep, just lucky, I guess. Here she is.

881
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:00,360
<33-9,JAMES>在哪  我咋没看到  在哪呢
<33-9,JAMES>Where? I don't even-- is she over-- where is it?

882
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,490
<33-10,ESPOSITO>你看到她了吗  我看不到  她--
<33-10,ESPOSITO>Did you see her? I don't even see her. Is she--

883
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,650
<33-10,ESPOSITO>是我挡镜头了吗  拍不到
<33-10,ESPOSITO>Am I--am I in the way? Oh, you can't, uh, um...

884
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:06,040
<33-11,RYAN>糟糕  她走了  她在那呢
<33-11,RYAN>Oh, hey! Oh, there she goes. She's right there.

885
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:09,020
<33-12,RYAN>太可惜了  她上计程车了
<33-12,RYAN>Oh, no. Oh. She got in a cab.

886
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:11,380
<33-13,JAMES>好吧  我得到可靠消息了
<33-13,JAMES>All right, look, I got a tip, okay?

887
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:13,780
<33-13,JAMES>他们告诉我地点和时间  走到后门去
<33-13,JAMES>They said show up at such and such time, go in the back.

888
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:16,210
<33-13,JAMES>在保安撵我出来之前我拍了几张照片
<33-13,JAMES>I got a few shots before security threw me out.

889
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:17,180
<33-14,ESPOSITO>谁给你透露消息的
<33-14,ESPOSITO>So who gave you that tip?

890
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:19,390
<33-16,ESPOSITO>-我不能透露  -警民合作嘛
<33-16,ESPOSITO>- I can't tell you that. - I thought we were cool.

891
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:21,240
<33-17,JAMES>拜托  你们以为我会出卖我的线人吗
<33-17,JAMES>Oh, come on. You think I'm gonna rat out my sources?

892
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,660
<33-17,JAMES>我不会砸自己的饭碗
<33-17,JAMES>This is my livelihood.

893
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:24,310
<33-18,ESPOSITO>你觉得如果我和我搭档跟你一整天
<33-18,ESPOSITO>How do you think your livelihood's gonna go

894
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:26,410
<33-18,ESPOSITO>你的饭碗还保得住吗
<33-18,ESPOSITO>with me and my boy here following you around all day?

895
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:33,200
<34-1,BECKETT>专盯名人网的哈维·史崔克透露给他的
<34-1,BECKETT>Harvey Stryker from Celebgazer. com tipped him off?

896
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,260
<34-2,CASTLE>他不只是把照片挂在网上
<34-2,CASTLE>He didn't just run that photo on "Celebgazer,"

897
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:36,420
<34-2,CASTLE>整件事是他策划的
<34-2,CASTLE>he set the whole thing up.

898
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:38,860
<34-3,ESPOSITO>为什么  难不成这混蛋不自己伪造点丑闻
<34-3,ESPOSITO>But why? Doesn't this dirtbag have enough scandals to report on

899
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,540
<34-3,ESPOSITO>就没有其他可以报道了吗
<34-3,ESPOSITO>without having to make up his own?

900
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:42,920
<34-4,CASTLE>因为这不只是一起丑闻
<34-4,CASTLE>Because it wasn't just about the one scandal.

901
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:45,750
<34-4,CASTLE>多年来  曼迪用她公众形象的毁灭
<34-4,CASTLE>For years, Mandy has been drawing millions of eyeballs

902
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:48,400
<34-4,CASTLE>酗酒的劣迹  进了康复中心
<34-4,CASTLE>to "Celebgazer," with her public meltdowns,

903
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:51,060
<34-4,CASTLE>为专盯名人网招徕了无数眼球
<34-4,CASTLE>or drunken escapades, the, uh, trips to rehab.

904
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:52,740
<34-5,RYAN>但是过去的几个月  她很低调
<34-5,RYAN>But in the past few months, she calmed down,

905
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:53,930
<34-5,RYAN>她回到了井然有序的生活当中
<34-5,RYAN>got her life back in order.

906
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:55,210
<34-6,CASTLE>因为她遇到了扎克
<34-6,CASTLE>Because of Zach.

907
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:56,810
<34-6,CASTLE>而这对他们的生意不利
<34-6,CASTLE>Which was no good for business.

908
00:34:56,810 --> 00:34:59,140
<34-6,CASTLE>所以哈维拍了照  让曼迪回到
<34-6,CASTLE>So Harvey staged the photo, turns Mandy back into the train wreck

909
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:01,380
<34-6,CASTLE>糜烂的生活  好让他利用
<34-6,CASTLE>that he grew to love and exploit.

910
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:03,680
<34-7,ESPOSITO>这招很奏效  直到克莱尔扬言要
<34-7,ESPOSITO>And it worked, too, until Claire was gonna ruin it all

911
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,090
<34-7,ESPOSITO>将骗局昭告天下破坏这一切
<34-7,ESPOSITO>by calling the photo out as a hoax,

912
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:06,820
<34-7,ESPOSITO>摧毁哈维的名声
<34-7,ESPOSITO>destroying Harvey's reputation.

913
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:10,210
<34-8,CASTLE>所以哈维在公寓里
<34-8,CASTLE>And that's why Harvey was at the apartment.

914
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:12,510
<34-8,CASTLE>他不是在等曼迪  而是克莱尔
<34-8,CASTLE>He wasn't waiting for Mandy. He was waiting for Claire.

915
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,730
<34-8,CASTLE>他在等着杀她灭口
<34-8,CASTLE>He was waiting to silence her.

916
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:19,480
<35-1,HARVEY>假的  不  不  不可能
<35-1,HARVEY>Fake? No, no, no, no.

917
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,390
<35-1,HARVEY>专盯名人网才不造假呢
<35-1,HARVEY>Celebgazer.com doesn't do fake.

918
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:22,750
<35-2,CASTLE>你开了个先河
<35-2,CASTLE>And yet you ran that one.

919
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:23,850
<35-2,CASTLE>招了吧  哈维
<35-2,CASTLE>Come on, Harvey.

920
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:25,820
<35-3,BECKETT>我们知道整件事是你策划的
<35-3,BECKETT>We know you set the whole thing up.

921
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:28,520
<35-3,BECKETT>你雇佣杰西  然后收买克莱尔
<35-3,BECKETT>You paid Jesse, then you paid Claire.

922
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:31,180
<35-4,HARVEY>我没有收买任何人  克莱尔是谁呢
<35-4,HARVEY>I didn't pay anyone. And who is Claire?

923
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:33,410
<35-5,BECKETT>照片上的那女孩
<35-5,BECKETT>The girl in the photo.

924
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:37,310
<35-5,BECKETT>也就是威胁说要揭发你
<35-5,BECKETT>The one that you killed right

925
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:38,580
<35-5,BECKETT>之后被你杀了的那个女孩
<35-5,BECKETT>after she threatened to expose you?

926
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:39,450
<35-5,BECKETT>等等
<35-5,BECKETT>Wait a minute.

927
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:41,950
<35-6,HARVEY>我和这件事完全没有关系
<35-6,HARVEY>I had nothing to do with any of this.

928
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:44,050
<35-7,BECKETT>那你是怎么得到照片的
<35-7,BECKETT>So then how did you get that photo?

929
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:45,970
<35-8,HARVEY>我从一个自由记者的手上买的
<35-8,HARVEY>I bought it from a freelancer.

930
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:46,940
<35-9,BECKETT>我们和他谈过了
<35-9,BECKETT>We spoke with him.

931
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:48,800
<35-9,BECKETT>他说是你派他去那个酒吧的
<35-9,BECKETT>He said that you sent him to that bar,

932
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,360
<35-9,BECKETT>也就是说你知道克莱尔和杰西当时在那
<35-9,BECKETT>which means you knew Claire and Jesse were there.

933
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:54,580
<35-9,BECKETT>你是怎么知道的
<35-9,BECKETT>How did you know?

934
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:56,080
<35-10,HARVEY>用一贯的渠道知道的
<35-10,HARVEY>The same way I always know.

935
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:57,490
<35-10,HARVEY>有人向我透露的
<35-10,HARVEY>I was tipped!

936
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,480
<35-11,BECKETT>你以为我们会相信你的话吗
<35-11,BECKETT>Do you actually expect us to believe that?

937
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,880
<35-12,HARVEY>这是真的  我发誓
<35-12,HARVEY>It's true! I swear.

938
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,210
<35-12,HARVEY>我清清楚楚记得什么时候的事
<35-12,HARVEY>I remember exactly when it happened.

939
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:04,070
<35-12,HARVEY>他们打我电话  我可以证明给你们看
<35-12,HARVEY>They called my cell. I can show you.

940
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:07,190
<36-1,ESPOSITO>哈维给的那个电话来自一个一次性手机
<36-1,ESPOSITO>Yo, that phone call Harvey got came from a burner phone.

941
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:08,400
<36-1,ESPOSITO>用现金支付的
<36-1,ESPOSITO>Paid for with cash.

942
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,860
<36-2,BECKETT>所以他们在掩盖踪迹
<36-2,BECKETT>So they were covering their tracks.

943
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,590
<36-3,RYAN>只是他们的技术太糙了
<36-3,RYAN>Yeah, only they didn't do a very good job of it.

944
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:13,090
<36-3,RYAN>忘了禁用GPS
<36-3,RYAN>They forgot to disable the G.P.S.

945
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:14,830
<36-4,ESPOSITO>我们可以追踪GPS数据
<36-4,ESPOSITO>We were able to track the G.P.S. data.

946
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:16,220
<36-4,ESPOSITO>案子发生的那天晚上
<36-4,ESPOSITO>Yeah. That phone was in the alley

947
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:17,790
<36-4,ESPOSITO>那个电话在曼迪那栋楼后面的小巷里
<36-4,ESPOSITO>behind Mandy's building the night of the murder.

948
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:22,140
<36-5,CASTLE>所以买这个电话的人就是凶手
<36-5,CASTLE>So then whoever bought that phone is our killer.

949
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:25,350
<37-1,BECKETT>谢谢你们过来一趟  我们  我们只是想
<37-1,BECKETT>Thank you for coming in. We, uh, we just wanted

950
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:28,540
<37-1,BECKETT>让你们了解调查的最新进展
<37-1,BECKETT>to keep you up-to-date on the investigation.

951
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:29,870
<37-2,MANDY>这么说是有新的进展了吗
<37-2,MANDY>So there's been a development?

952
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,630
<37-3,BECKETT>是的  我们有新的线索
<37-3,BECKETT>Yes, we have a lead.

953
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:34,210
<37-3,BECKETT>我们已经识别出了
<37-3,BECKETT>We've identified the cell phone of the person

954
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:35,920
<37-3,BECKETT>策划假照片那个人的手机
<37-3,BECKETT>that set up that fake photo.

955
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:39,170
<37-3,BECKETT>而且我们相信这和杀了克莱尔·萨缪尔斯是同一个人
<37-3,BECKETT>And we believe the same person killed Claire Samuels.

956
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,450
<37-4,MANDY>是谁
<37-4,MANDY>Who is it?

957
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:42,400
<37-5,CASTLE>实际上  是个一次性手机
<37-5,CASTLE>Well, actually, it was a burner phone.

958
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:43,840
<37-5,CASTLE>一次性手机
<37-5,CASTLE>A burner phone?

959
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,770
<37-6,MARILYN>也就是说无法追踪到
<37-6,MARILYN>So it's not traceable.

960
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:47,200
<37-7,CASTLE>通常来说  是追踪不到没错
<37-7,CASTLE>Uh, normally, it wouldn't be.

961
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:48,430
<37-7,CASTLE>但是买了手机的这个人
<37-7,CASTLE>But the person who bought this phone

962
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:50,820
<37-7,CASTLE>犯了一个致命的错误
<37-7,CASTLE>made one crucial mistake.

963
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,630
<37-7,CASTLE>他们用完之后没有扔掉
<37-7,CASTLE>They didn't get rid of it when they were done.

964
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:56,180
<37-7,CASTLE>事实上  那个手机现在还开着
<37-7,CASTLE>Matter of fact, it's still on right now.

965
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,930
<37-8,MANDY>妈妈
<37-8,MANDY>Mom?

966
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:12,230
<37-8,MANDY>妈妈
<37-8,MANDY>Mom!

967
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:15,020
<37-9,MANDY>那张照片是你安排的
<37-9,MANDY>You set up that photo?

968
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:18,540
<37-9,MANDY>这一切都是你干的  你为什么要这么做
<37-9,MANDY>You did this to me? Why would you do that?

969
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,250
<37-9,MANDY>你为什么想要毁掉我的生活
<37-9,MANDY>Why do you wanna ruin my life?

970
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,080
<37-10,MARILYN>毁掉你生活的人是扎克
<37-10,MARILYN>It was Zach who was ruining your life.

971
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:24,730
<37-10,MARILYN>我是在拯救你
<37-10,MARILYN>I was saving you.

972
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:27,210
<37-11,MANDY>等一下  等等  你这么做
<37-11,MANDY>Wait a minute. Wait. You did this

973
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:28,940
<37-11,MANDY>是为了拆散我和扎克
<37-11,MANDY>to break me up with Zach?

974
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:32,560
<37-11,MANDY>他是我这辈子遇到的最好的事情了
<37-11,MANDY>He was the best thing that ever happened to me.

975
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,410
<37-11,MANDY>他准备带我离开这一切
<37-11,MANDY>He was gonna take me away from all of this.

976
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:36,840
<37-12,MARILYN>是啊  带你离开我们一直努力奋斗得来的一切
<37-12,MARILYN>That's right, away from everything we'd worked for --

977
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:39,850
<37-12,MARILYN>你的巡回演出  你的事业
<37-12,MARILYN>your tour, your career,

978
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:41,790
<37-13,MANDY>他会害你损失上百万的
<37-13,MANDY>he was gonna cost you millions.

979
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:43,610
<37-13,MANDY>你是说害你损失上百万吧
<37-13,MANDY>You mean cost you millions?

980
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:44,840
<37-14,MARILYN>你放弃这一切是图什么呢
<37-14,MARILYN>And for what?

981
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,780
<37-15,MANDY>过普通人生活的机会
<37-15,MANDY>A chance to be normal!

982
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:47,990
<37-15,MANDY>普通人
<37-15,MANDY>Normal.

983
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:49,410
<37-16,MARILYN>你生来就与众不同
<37-16,MARILYN>You're special.

984
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,480
<37-16,MARILYN>扎克不理解
<37-16,MARILYN>Zach didn't understand that.

985
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,890
<37-16,MARILYN>克莱尔也无法理解
<37-16,MARILYN>And neither did Claire.

986
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,780
<37-17,MANDY>所以你就把她给杀了
<37-17,MANDY>So you...killed her?

987
00:37:58,130 --> 00:38:00,510
<37-18,MARILYN>她要把我所做的一切告诉你
<37-18,MARILYN>She was gonna tell you what I'd done.

988
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:03,680
<37-18,MARILYN>她要让你恨我
<37-18,MARILYN>She was gonna make you hate me.

989
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:06,710
<37-18,MARILYN>我不能让她分裂咱俩
<37-18,MARILYN>I couldn't let her drive a wedge between us.

990
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:07,730
<37-18,MARILYN>我做不到
<37-18,MARILYN>I couldn't.

991
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:10,350
<37-19,BECKETT>玛丽莲·萨顿  请起身
<37-19,BECKETT>Marilyn Sutton, please stand up.

992
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,770
<37-20,BECKETT>转过身去
<37-20,BECKETT>Turn around.

993
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:15,400
<37-20,BECKETT>你因谋杀克莱尔·萨缪尔斯
<37-20,BECKETT>You're under arrest for the murder

994
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,850
<37-20,BECKETT>而被捕
<37-20,BECKETT>of Claire Samuels.

995
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:21,530
<37-21,MARILYN>曼迪  亲爱的  你理解妈妈的所作所为的  对吧
<37-21,MARILYN>Mandy, sweetie, you understand, right?

996
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,420
<37-21,MARILYN>我这么做都是为了你呀  曼迪
<37-21,MARILYN>I did this for you, Mandy.

997
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,150
<37-21,MARILYN>我做的一切都是为了你呀
<37-21,MARILYN>Everything I did, I did for you.

998
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,460
<37-22,MANDY>不  妈妈
<37-22,MANDY>No, mom.

999
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,490
<37-22,MANDY>你这么做都是为了你自己
<37-22,MANDY>You did it for you.

1000
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:38,590
<37-23,BECKETT>走吧
<37-23,BECKETT>Let's go.

1001
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:42,990
<38-1,MANDY>正当我以为
<38-1,MANDY>Just when I thought

1002
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,490
<38-1,MANDY>我的生活已经跌倒谷底了
<38-1,MANDY>life couldn't get any more messed up, right?

1003
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:50,840
<38-1,MANDY>真是雪上加霜啊  媒体肯定爱死这种猛料了
<38-1,MANDY>And the train wreck continues. The press is gonna love this.

1004
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,640
<38-2,CASTLE>抱歉  我得走了
<38-2,CASTLE>Sorry. I'm gonna go.

<38-2,CASTLE>谢谢你们
<38-2,CASTLE>Thank you.

1006
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:03,310
<38-3,CASTLE>曼迪  抱歉  我不是想要干涉你的生活
<38-3,CASTLE>Um, hey, Mandy. Sorry, um, not to pry,

1007
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:07,460
<38-3,CASTLE>可我认为遇到这种事后  逃走躲起来
<38-3,CASTLE>but, uh, it would be really easy just to run and hide

1008
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:08,720
<38-3,CASTLE>的确是很容易的选择
<38-3,CASTLE>from all this.

1009
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:11,400
<38-4,MANDY>但别这么做
<38-4,MANDY>But don't.

<38-4,MANDY>Um, could you thank Alexis for me, too, please?

<38-5,CASTLE>Actually, I don't know where she went. There's, oh --

1015
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:31,370
<38-6,ALEXIS>我回来了  我还带了个人来
<38-6,ALEXIS>I'm back, and I've brought someone with me.
