<1-2,KATE BECKETT>如果...你愿意跟我一起玩旷工

<1-3,CASTLE>如果还是在工作  算是旷工吗
<1-3,CASTLE>Is it technically playing hooky if we're working?

<6-8,ESPOSITO>莱恩缠着我不放就因为我目前不出去约会
<6-8,ESPOSITO>Ryan is all up on my back 'cause I'm not dating anyone right now.

<6-9,RYAN>跟她讲讲原因

134
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:56,210
<6-12,BECKETT>可惜蕾妮和埃斯波又分手了
<6-12,BECKETT>Oh, except Lanie and Espo are broken up yet again.

135
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,720
<6-13,BECKETT>怎么  你们是分手了  得了吧
<6-13,BECKETT>What, you guys have. Come on.

00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,140
<6-14,ESPOSITO>他和珍妮也不能因此
<6-14,ESPOSITO>Yeah, but that's no reason for him and Jenny

137
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,900
<6-14,ESPOSITO>就认为我找不到其他人一块去
<6-14,ESPOSITO>to think I can't find anyone else to take.

138
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,310
<6-14,ESPOSITO>拜托  我不愁找不到女伴
<6-14,ESPOSITO>I mean, come on. I have no problem getting girls.

139
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:07,190
<6-15,RYAN>但问题来了  你不用去找
<6-15,RYAN>But that's the thing. You don't have to get one.

140
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,360
<6-15,RYAN>珍妮和我已经找好了  我们有个朋友
<6-15,RYAN>Jenny and I already have. We -- we have a friend --

<6-17,BECKETT>埃斯波  听他说完
<6-17,BECKETT>Espo, just hear him out.

<6-18,RYAN>她名叫史黛西  她很不错的
<6-18,RYAN>Her name is Stacy. She's fantastic.

145
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,930
<6-18,RYAN>有一家唱片行  还喜欢运动
<6-18,RYAN>She runs a music store. She's into sports.

146
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:22,200
<6-18,RYAN>我们跟她说了你的事  她想见见你
<6-18,RYAN>And we told her all about you. She wants to meet.

147
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,870
<6-18,RYAN>看看她的照片
<6-18,RYAN>Take a look at her picture.

<6-21,BECKETT>还行而已  埃斯波  她美呆了
<6-21,BECKETT>She's all right? Espo, she's stunning,

151
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,410
<6-21,BECKETT>你连见她一面都不肯
<6-21,BECKETT>and you won't even meet with her.

152
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:41,340
<6-22,ESPOSITO>好吧  也许能见一面
<6-22,ESPOSITO>Okay, maybe I will.

153
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,900
<6-22,ESPOSITO>那也只是因为她这么期待见我
<6-22,ESPOSITO>But only because she's so excited to meet me,

154
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,220
<6-22,ESPOSITO>你懂的  我不太喜欢让女孩子失望

00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:26,820
<7-2,CASTLE>贝克特  他杀了她

<7-2,CASTLE>他...杀了她  他
<7-2,CASTLE>he -- he killed her. He --

<7-2,CASTLE>贝克特  能听到我说话吗
<7-2,CASTLE>Beckett, can you hear me?

162
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:34,410
<7-2,CASTLE>该死
<7-2,CASTLE>Damn it.

163
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,370
<7-2,CASTLE>他开走了我的车
<7-2,CASTLE>He took my car.

164
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,360
<9-1,CASTLE>该死
<9-1,CASTLE>Damn it.

166
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:20,740
<10-1,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你在哪
<10-1,BECKETT>Castle, where are you?

167
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,170
<10-2,CASTLE>-贝克特她死了  -等等  慢点说
<10-2,CASTLE>- Beckett, she's dead. She's dead. - Wait, slow down.

168
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:26,780
<10-3,BECKETT>-怎么了  -伊娃被她丈夫杀死了
<10-3,BECKETT>- What's -- what's going on? Eva was murdered by her husband.

169
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,660
<10-4,CASTLE>他杀了她  我没能
<10-4,CASTLE>He killed her, and I couldn't...

170
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:32,250
<10-4,CASTLE>我没能阻止这件事
<10-4,CASTLE>I couldn't stop it. I couldn't.

180
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,940
<10-4,CASTLE>尼利警探  就像我之前跟你说过的
<10-4,CASTLE>Detective Neely, as I already told you,

181
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,490
<10-4,CASTLE>我跟踪科尔·威特福德来到这
<10-4,CASTLE>I followed Cole Whitfield up here.

182
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:45,700
<11-1,CASTLE>肯定是他打晕了我
<11-1,CASTLE>He must have knocked me out

183
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,720
<11-1,CASTLE>因为我醒来后  他走了  我的车也不见了
<11-1,CASTLE>Because when I came to, he was gone and so was my car.

184
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:51,050
<11-2,DETECTIVE NEELY>你起初为什么会去他家
<11-2,DETECTIVE NEELY>And why did you go to his house in the first place?

185
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,600
<11-3,CASTLE>我去给伊娃送照片
<11-3,CASTLE>To give the photos to Eva.

186
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,800
<11-3,CASTLE>也就是那时我听到了尖叫声
<11-3,CASTLE>That's when I heard the screaming,

187
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:57,150
<11-3,CASTLE>我还看到他从厨房把她拖了出来
<11-3,CASTLE>and I saw him dragging her body through the kitchen.

188
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:59,660
<11-3,CASTLE>我没来得及做什么  他就带着她开车走了
<11-3,CASTLE>Before I could do anything, he drove off with her.

189
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,070
<11-4,NEELY>卡塞尔先生  据资料显示
<11-4,NEELY>Mr. Castle, it says here

190
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:03,620
<11-4,NEELY>你一个月前才拿到私人侦探的执照
<11-4,NEELY>you only got your P.I. license a month ago.

191
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:04,980
<11-5,CASTLE>是的  所以呢
<11-5,CASTLE>Yes, so?

192
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:07,110
<11-6,NEELY>所以你确定你看到了所发生的事吗
<11-6,NEELY>So, are you sure about what you saw?

193
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,410
<11-7,CASTLE>当然  我很确定  我
<11-7,CASTLE>Of course, I'm sure. I --

194
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:09,640
<11-8,BECKETT>警探  我认识卡塞尔
<11-8,BECKETT>Detective, I know Castle.

195
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,500
<11-8,BECKETT>如果他说发生了那肯定就是的
<11-8,BECKETT>If he says it happened, it did.

196
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,160
<11-9,OFFICER KEMP>他说的部分内容被证实了
<11-9,OFFICER KEMP>Part of his story checks out.

197
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,520
<11-9,OFFICER KEMP>我们发现他的车停在一条
<11-9,OFFICER KEMP>We found his car parked on an access road

198
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,870
<11-9,OFFICER KEMP>离这儿大约一百米的通道上
<11-9,OFFICER KEMP>about a hundred yards from here.

199
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:17,710
<11-10,BECKETT>威特福德肯定是
<11-10,BECKETT>Whitfield must have hid

200
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,780
<11-10,BECKETT>为了逃跑躲在卡塞尔的车里
<11-10,BECKETT>in Castle's car in order to make his getaway.

201
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,600
<11-11,CASTLE>警探  我没有编故事
<11-11,CASTLE>Detective, I am not making this up.

202
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,570
<11-11,CASTLE>威特福德的房子就是犯罪现场
<11-11,CASTLE>The Whitfield house is a crime scene.

203
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:26,000
<11-11,CASTLE>如果我们去厨房就会找到血迹
<11-11,CASTLE>If we go to that kitchen, we will find blood --

204
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,250
<11-11,CASTLE>伊娃的血
<11-11,CASTLE>Eva's blood.

205
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,270
<11-11,CASTLE>我是警探尼利
<11-11,CASTLE>I'm Detective Neely.

206
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,570
<12-1,NEELY>能跟你谈一会儿吗
<12-1,NEELY>Do you have a few minutes to talk?

207
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:35,570
<12-2,COLE>可以  进来吧
<12-2,COLE>Yeah, come on in.

208
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:43,910
<12-3,COLE>发生了什么事
<12-3,COLE>So, what is this all about?

209
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:45,760
<12-3,COLE>我能为你们做些什么吗
<12-3,COLE>What can I do for you folks?

210
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,970
<12-4,NEELY>威特福德先生  你的妻子伊娃在家吗
<12-4,NEELY>Mr. Whitfield, is your wife, Eva, home?

211
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,300
<12-5,COLE>不在  怎么了
<12-5,COLE>No. Why?

212
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,870
<12-6,NEELY>你知道她在哪吗
<12-6,NEELY>Do you know where she is?

213
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:57,270
<12-7,COLE>我不知道  我20分钟前才到家
<12-7,COLE>No, I don't. I got home about 20 minutes ago.

214
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,190
<12-7,COLE>找到了这张伊娃留下的字条
<12-7,COLE>Found this lovely note from Eva.

215
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:03,530
<12-8,COLE>她发现了我有外遇  就离开了我
<12-8,COLE>She figured out I'm having an affair, and she left me.

216
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:04,990
<12-9,CASTLE>她离开了他
<12-9,CASTLE>She left him?

217
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:07,700
<12-9,CASTLE>我没法相信这个人  他伪造了那张字条
<12-9,CASTLE>I can't believe this guy. He forged that note.

218
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,220
<12-10,COLE>我都联系不上她
<12-10,COLE>I can't even get in touch with her.

219
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,010
<12-10,COLE>我给她打了一遍又一遍电话
<12-10,COLE>I tried calling her. I tried calling her.

220
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:12,920
<12-10,COLE>电话直接就跳转到语音信箱了
<12-10,COLE>The phone just goes straight to voicemail.

221
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:15,490
<12-11,BECKETT>你开的是一辆黑色的跑车吗
<12-11,BECKETT>Do you drive a black model "S"?

222
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:19,340
<12-12,COLE>不是  那是伊娃的车
<12-12,COLE>No, that's... No, that's, uh, Eva's car.

223
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:23,340
<12-12,COLE>-伊娃出什么事了吗  -我们还不确定
<12-12,COLE>- Has something happened to Eva? - We're not quite sure,

224
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,690
<12-13,NEELY>你说你20分钟前才到家的吗
<12-13,NEELY>But you're saying you only got home 20 minutes ago?

225
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,330
<12-14,COLE>是的  九点半左右
<12-14,COLE>Yeah, right. Uh, around 9:30.

00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,870
<12-15,BECKETT>你今晚7点45的时候在哪
<12-15,BECKETT>And where were you at 7:45 tonight?

227
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,250
<12-16,COLE>我还在市里
<12-16,COLE>I was, um... I was still in the city.

228
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,190
<12-16,COLE>我在工作
<12-16,COLE>I was at work.

229
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:38,970
<12-16,COLE>你知道吗  我想我得再去添点酒
<12-16,COLE>You know what? I-I think I need a refill.

230
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,460
<12-16,COLE>不好意思
<12-16,COLE>Excuse me.

231
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:45,360
<12-17,CASTLE>他在撒谎  他在胡说八道
<12-17,CASTLE>He's lying. He's lying about everything.

232
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,920
<12-18,NEELY>如果你说的对  那厨房肯定会有血迹
<12-18,NEELY>If you're right, there should be blood evidence in the kitchen.

233
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,500
<13-1,CASTLE>就在这
<13-1,CASTLE>It was here.

234
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:53,400
<13-1,CASTLE>就在这里  他肯定把这里弄干净了
<13-1,CASTLE>It happened right here. He must have cleaned it up.

235
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,210
<13-1,CASTLE>否则他怎么会这么轻易就让我们进来
<13-1,CASTLE>Why else would he invite us so freely into his house?

236
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,590
<13-2,NEELY>如果真是他干的  那他做得太好了
<13-2,NEELY>If he did, he did a hell of a good job of it.

237
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:00,580
<13-2,NEELY>紫外线照射看不出血迹残留
<13-2,NEELY>U.V. shows no sign of residue.

238
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,950
<13-4,CASTLE>-卡塞尔  -凯特  我知道我看到了什么
<13-4,CASTLE>- Castle... - Kate, I know what I saw.

242
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:10,440
<13-6,NEELY>先生  这里有血迹残留的痕迹
<13-6,NEELY>Sir, there's blood residue here.

243
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:13,040
<13-7,BECKETT>威特福德先生  你知道血是哪来的吗
<13-7,BECKETT>Mr. Whitfield, do you know where this came from?

244
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:16,990
<13-7,BECKETT>知道
<13-7,BECKETT>Yes.

245
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,730
<13-8,COLE>我妻子总是笨手笨脚的
<13-8,COLE>My wife is a klutz.

246
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:20,940
<13-8,COLE>她把罐子打破了  收拾的时候割破了手
<13-8,COLE>She broke a jar and cut her hand cleaning it up.

247
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,380
<13-8,COLE>血流得到处都是  直到她用绷带包住
<13-8,COLE>Bled everywhere until she finally bandaged it.

248
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:26,830
<13-8,COLE>为什么  你们为什么要找血迹残留
<13-8,COLE>Why -- why are you looking for blood residue?

249
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:34,400
<13-9,COLE>你们是认为我对我妻子做了什么吗
<13-9,COLE>Are you suggesting that I did something to my wife?

250
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:37,810
<13-10,CASTLE>不  我们没有这么想  威特福德先生
<13-10,CASTLE>No, we're not suggesting, Mr. Whitfield.

251
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:41,370
<13-11,COLE>出去
<13-11,COLE>Get out.

252
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:42,620
<13-11,COLE>离开我家
<13-11,COLE>Get out of my house.

253
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,630
<13-11,COLE>赶紧离开
<13-11,COLE>Get out now.

254
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:02,990
<14-1,BECKETT>你起来多长时间了
<14-1,BECKETT>How long have you been up?

255
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,880
<14-2,CASTLE>可能是他回到家
<14-2,CASTLE>He probably came home,

256
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,300
<14-2,CASTLE>看到伊娃准备要离开他
<14-2,CASTLE>saw that Eva was about to leave him,

257
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,020
<14-2,CASTLE>所以一时冲动杀了她
<14-2,CASTLE>and killed her in a fit of rage.

258
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:12,060
<14-2,CASTLE>我跟她说过一切都会没事的
<14-2,CASTLE>I told her everything was gonna be all right.

259
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:13,290
<14-2,CASTLE>我向她保证过
<14-2,CASTLE>I promised her.

260
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:15,900
<14-3,BECKETT>对不起  宝贝
<14-3,BECKETT>I'm sorry, babe.

261
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,130
<14-4,CASTLE>尼利警探那有什么消息吗
<14-4,CASTLE>Have you heard from Detective Neely?

262
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:20,190
<14-5,BECKETT>她说搜寻小队在树林里
<14-5,BECKETT>She said that search teams

263
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:22,230
<14-5,BECKETT>什么也没发现
<14-5,BECKETT>didn't find anything in the woods.

264
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:22,940
<14-5,BECKETT>肯定的
<14-5,BECKETT>Yeah.

265
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:25,420
<14-6,CASTLE>因为科尔明白他不能把她留在那
<14-6,CASTLE>That's because Cole knew he couldn't leave her out there,

266
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:28,080
<14-6,CASTLE>因为他知道我看到了  所以他把她放到车上
<14-6,CASTLE>not once I was onto him, so he put her back in the car

267
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,400
<14-6,CASTLE>然后把车和尸体分别遗弃掉了
<14-6,CASTLE>and dumped it and the body someplace else.

268
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:33,340
<14-7,BECKETT>韦斯切斯特的警察已经对伊娃的车发出了全境通告
<14-7,BECKETT>Westchester has got a BOLO out on Eva's car,

269
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,200
<14-7,BECKETT>也对她的信用卡做了标记
<14-7,BECKETT>and they've flagged her credit cards.

270
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,330
<14-8,CASTLE>他们找到她手机的位置了吗
<14-8,CASTLE>Have they pinged her cellphone?

271
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:38,920
<14-9,BECKETT>他们试过  可是手机不是关机了就是没电了
<14-9,BECKETT>They tried, but it's either off or dead.

272
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,200
<14-10,CASTLE>我看是没电了[死了]
<14-10,CASTLE>Yeah, I want to go with dead.

273
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,540
<14-10,CASTLE>他的不在场证据呢
<14-10,CASTLE>What about his alibi?

274
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:45,710
<14-11,BECKETT>他当时不是像他说的在工作
<14-11,BECKETT>Well, he wasn't at work like he said.

275
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:47,060
<14-11,BECKETT>他的工作伙伴说
<14-11,BECKETT>His business partners said

276
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,880
<14-11,BECKETT>他不是晚上八点离开的  而是六点
<14-11,BECKETT>that he left at 6:00 P.M., not at 8:00.

277
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,310
<14-12,CASTLE>有足够的时间让他在7:45回到韦斯切斯特
<14-12,CASTLE>Plenty of time to get back to Westchester by 7:45.

278
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:52,360
<14-13,BECKETT>可是当尼利警探
<14-13,BECKETT>But when Detective Neely

279
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,580
<14-13,BECKETT>质问他时  他又改口了
<14-13,BECKETT>confronted him about it, he revised his story.

280
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:56,120
<14-13,BECKETT>他说他当时跟他的情人
<14-13,BECKETT>He said that he was with his mistress,

281
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,340
<14-13,BECKETT>泰勒·麦金利  也就是
<14-13,BECKETT>Taylor Mckinley, that woman

282
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:59,930
<14-13,BECKETT>你照到的那个女人  一直待到晚上八点
<14-13,BECKETT>that you took pictures of, until 8:00 P.M.

283
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:01,510
<14-14,CASTLE>我们要跟她谈谈
<14-14,CASTLE>We need to talk to her.

284
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,470
<14-15,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我没有管辖权
<14-15,BECKETT>Castle, I don't have any jurisdiction.

285
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:04,910
<14-15,BECKETT>这不是我的案子
<14-15,BECKETT>This isn't my case.

286
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:07,670
<14-16,CASTLE>是的  但这是我的案子  伊娃雇了我
<14-16,CASTLE>Yes, but it's my case. Eva hired me.

287
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,320
<14-16,CASTLE>她是我的朋友
<14-16,CASTLE>She was my friend,

288
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,060
<14-16,CASTLE>而且她是在我眼前被杀的
<14-16,CASTLE>and he killed her right in front of me.

289
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:16,650
<14-17,BECKETT>好吧  我去跟他情人谈
<14-17,BECKETT>Okay. I'll talk to the mistress.

290
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:20,530
<14-17,BECKETT>但只有我一个人  你对这事有私人感情
<14-17,BECKETT>But just me, not you. You're too close to this.

291
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,070
<15-1,TAYLOR MCKINLEY>怎么了  我跟他有婚外情  他老婆走了
<15-1,TAYLOR MCKINLEY>So? We had an affair, and his wife left.

292
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,170
<15-1,TAYLOR MCKINLEY>有什么大不了  这种事每天都有
<15-1,TAYLOR MCKINLEY>What's the big deal? That stuff happens every day.

293
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:33,580
<15-2,BECKETT>可是不是每天都有老婆失踪
<15-2,BECKETT>Except wives don't go missing every day.

294
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:36,850
<15-3,TAYLOR>现在就说她失踪有点为时过早吧
<15-3,TAYLOR>It's a little soon to say she's missing, isn't it?

295
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,840
<15-3,TAYLOR>我确定她会回来的
<15-3,TAYLOR>I'm sure she'll be back.

296
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,990
<15-4,BECKETT>麦金利小姐  你认识威特福德先生多久了
<15-4,BECKETT>Ms. Mckinley, how long have you known Mr. Whitfield?

297
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:44,050
<15-5,TAYLOR>从他去年上我的瑜伽课开始认识的
<15-5,TAYLOR>Since he started my yoga class a year ago.

298
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,860
<15-6,BECKETT>婚外情是什么时候开始的
<15-6,BECKETT>And when did the affair begin?

<15-8,BECKETT>What time did he come to your apartment last night?

303
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:58,960
<15-9,TAYLOR>我跟另一个警探说过
<15-9,TAYLOR>Like I told the other detective,

304
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:02,520
<15-9,TAYLOR>他六点左右来的  刚过八点以后走的
<15-9,TAYLOR>he showed up right around 6:00 and he left just after 8:00.

305
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,780
<15-10,BECKETT>期间这段时间你们俩都在屋里
<15-10,BECKETT>So, the two of you were in the apartment the whole time?

306
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:07,730
<15-11,TAYLOR>是的
<15-11,TAYLOR>Yep.

307
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:12,060
<15-11,TAYLOR>你怎么看
<15-11,TAYLOR>Well, what did you think?

308
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,570
<16-1,RYAN>她很有对抗性
<16-1,RYAN>She was confrontational

309
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:16,120
<16-2,BECKETT>而且对问题准备得也太充分了
<16-2,BECKETT>and a little too ready with her answers.

310
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,600
<16-3,ESPOSITO>你觉得她在撒谎
<16-3,ESPOSITO>You think she's lying?

311
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,500
<16-4,BECKETT>去她住的地方
<16-4,BECKETT>Go down to her building,

312
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,790
<16-4,BECKETT>问问有没有人昨晚看到科尔·威特福德在那
<16-4,BECKETT>see if anyone else saw Cole Whitfield there last night.

313
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:22,770
<16-4,BECKETT>还要再查一下威特福德先生
<16-4,BECKETT>And let's look into Mr. Whitfield,

314
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:24,480
<16-4,BECKETT>看看他还有没有别的事瞒着我们
<16-4,BECKETT>find out what else he's hiding from us.

315
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,960
<16-4,BECKETT>好的

<17-2,COLE>-你在干什么  -我...
<17-2,COLE>- What the hell are you doing? - I-I was...

318
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,240
<17-3,CASTLE>你先是指控我杀人
<17-3,CASTLE>You accuse me of murder,

319
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,290
<17-4,COLE>然后又来我家跟踪我
<17-4,COLE>then you come stalking around my home?

320
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:08,760
<17-4,COLE>你有什么病

<17-7,CASTLE>I'm not the one who killed my wife.

323
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,550
<17-8,COLE>你简直是神经病  伊娃还活着
<17-8,COLE>You're insane, you know that? Eva's alive.

324
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,940
<17-8,COLE>她二十分钟前刚给我打过电话
<17-8,COLE>She just called me 20 minutes ago.

325
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:18,770
<17-9,CASTLE>你骗人
<17-9,CASTLE>You're a liar.

326
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:19,800
<17-9,CASTLE>我也想
<17-9,CASTLE>Yeah, I wish.

327
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,600
<17-10,COLE>因为她让我去死
<17-10,COLE>Because she told me to go screw myself

328
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,320
<17-10,COLE>还把我们的联合银行账户都清空了
<17-10,COLE>and that she cleaned out our joint bank accounts.

329
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,960
<17-10,COLE>你不相信我  可以查查我的银行账户
<17-10,COLE>Yeah, you don't believe me, you can check with my bank.

330
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:28,770
<17-10,COLE>你们搜查我房子时
<17-10,COLE>While you guys were searching my house,

331
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:31,980
<17-10,COLE>那个贱人从我这偷走了七百四十万
<17-10,COLE>the bitch stole $7.4 million from me.

332
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,630
<17-11,NEELY>威特福德先生  有什么事吗
<17-11,NEELY>Mr. Whitfield, is there a problem?

333
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:38,030
<17-12,COLE>是的  这个人在骚扰我
<17-12,COLE>Yes. This man is harassing me.

334
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:41,230
<17-12,COLE>你什么都证明不了
<17-12,COLE>Hey, you'll never prove a thing.

335
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:44,810
<17-12,COLE>他...
<17-12,COLE>He...

336
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,980
<18-1,BECKETT>你疯了吗  你是怎么想的
<18-1,BECKETT>Are you crazy? What were you thinking?

337
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:50,580
<18-2,CASTLE>你昨晚也见到他了  他很自大
<18-2,CASTLE>You saw him last night. He's cocky.

338
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,410
<18-2,CASTLE>自大的男人会怎样
<18-2,CASTLE>And what do all cocky men do?

339
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,630
<18-3,BECKETT>犯错
<18-3,BECKETT>Make mistakes.

340
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:54,720
<18-3,BECKETT>没错
<18-3,BECKETT>Exactly.

341
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:57,570
<18-4,CASTLE>等等  你是说我  对吧
<18-4,CASTLE>Wait, you're talking about me now, aren't you?

342
00:17:57,570 --> 00:17:59,360
<18-5,BECKETT>你是唯一的目击者  你这是在毁掉
<18-5,BECKETT>You're the only witness, and you are ruining

343
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,900
<18-5,BECKETT>你的可信度  而我却一直在帮你
<18-5,BECKETT>your credibility when I'm trying to help you.

344
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,120
<18-5,BECKETT>要是盖茨知道了怎么办
<18-5,BECKETT>What if this gets back to Gates?

345
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,870
<18-6,CASTLE>我只是想找些证据
<18-6,CASTLE>I'm just trying to find some proof.

346
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:06,630
<18-7,BECKETT>现在  证据对科尔有利
<18-7,BECKETT>Right now, the proof lies with Cole.

347
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:09,500
<18-7,BECKETT>伊娃的通话记录显示她今早9:35给他打过电话
<18-7,BECKETT>Eva's phone records confirm a call to him at 9:35 this morning,

348
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,380
<18-7,BECKETT>昨晚还有740万美元
<18-7,BECKETT>And there's also that $7.4 million transfer

349
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:14,200
<18-7,BECKETT>转入了瑞士银行账户
<18-7,BECKETT>to a Swiss bank account last night.

350
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:16,640
<18-8,CASTLE>没错  他是在创造合理的疑点
<18-8,CASTLE>Yes, he's creating reasonable doubt,

351
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,590
<18-8,CASTLE>营造出她偷了他的钱财
<18-8,CASTLE>Building a narrative that she stole from him,

352
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:19,350
<18-8,CASTLE>然后跑路的假象
<18-8,CASTLE>That she's on the run.

353
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:22,670
<18-8,CASTLE>所以我们才找不到尸体  他的计划就是这样的
<18-8,CASTLE>That's why we can't find the body. That's his plan.

354
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,860
<18-9,ESPOSITO>我刚从那位情妇的公寓回来
<18-9,ESPOSITO>I just got back from the mistress' apartment building.

355
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,850
<18-9,ESPOSITO>没人记得昨晚看到过威特福德
<18-9,ESPOSITO>No one remembers seeing Whitfield at all last night.

356
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:28,280
<18-10,CASTLE>证明他并不在那里
<18-10,CASTLE>Proving he wasn't there.

357
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:30,520
<18-11,BECKETT>那只能证明没人看到过他
<18-11,BECKETT>Proving that no one saw him.

358
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,370
<18-11,BECKETT>没有尸体的话
<18-11,BECKETT>Without a body,

359
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:33,520
<18-11,BECKETT>我们需要些比这更确凿的证据
<18-11,BECKETT>We're gonna need something more solid than that.

360
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,630
<18-12,RYAN>嘿  你们猜怎么着
<18-12,RYAN>Hey, guess what.

361
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,790
<18-12,RYAN>调查发现威特福德之前就结过婚
<18-12,RYAN>Turns out Whitfield was married before,

362
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,020
<18-12,RYAN>在洛杉矶结的
<18-12,RYAN>In Los Angeles.

363
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,520
<18-12,RYAN>玛罗琳·威特福德
<18-12,RYAN>Mallory Whitfield --

364
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,120
<18-12,RYAN>她曾经拥有一笔价值几百万的遗产
<18-12,RYAN>She had an inheritance worth several million dollars.

365
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,040
<18-14,RYAN>-曾经  -是的  她在徒步旅行途中去世了
<18-14,RYAN>- Had? - Yeah, she died in a hiking accident

366
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,070
<18-14,RYAN>就在洛杉矶国家森林公园中  跌入了一个峡谷中
<18-14,RYAN>In Angeles national forest -- fell into a ravine.

367
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:49,020
<18-14,RYAN>-猜猜唯一的目击证人是谁  -她丈夫科尔
<18-14,RYAN>- Guess who the only witness was. - Her husband, Cole.

368
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:51,570
<18-16,RYAN>没错  警方曾试图以谋杀罪调查他
<18-16,RYAN>Bingo. The cops tried to make a murder case against him,

369
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:52,530
<18-16,RYAN>但他应对得滴水不漏
<18-16,RYAN>but he had all the answers.

370
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:54,410
<18-16,RYAN>他们无法对他提起有力的控诉
<18-16,RYAN>They could never make any of the charges stick.

371
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:56,900
<18-16,RYAN>她的全部财产都转移到了科尔手中
<18-16,RYAN>Her entire estate went to Cole,

372
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,800
<18-16,RYAN>他正是借助那笔钱来创业发财的
<18-16,RYAN>which he used to start his business and build his fortune.

373
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,950
<18-17,CASTLE>他之前就逃脱了惩罚
<18-17,CASTLE>So, he got away with it before,

374
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:01,600
<18-17,CASTLE>现在他又打算故技重施
<18-17,CASTLE>And now he's trying to do it again.

375
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:05,120
<18-17,CASTLE>这根本不是冲动犯罪  是他早就计划好的
<18-17,CASTLE>This was no crime of passion. He planned the whole thing.

376
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:10,910
<19-1,BECKETT>科尔的第一任妻子死因很可疑
<19-1,BECKETT>So, Cole's first wife dies suspiciously,

377
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:13,480
<19-1,BECKETT>然后第二任妻子也消失了
<19-1,BECKETT>And then the second one disappears.

378
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,810
<19-2,RYAN>那不可能是巧合
<19-2,RYAN>No way that's a coincidence.

379
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:17,870
<19-2,RYAN>那家伙就是个黑寡妇  或者说黑鳏夫
<19-2,RYAN>This guy's a black widow -- or, rather, black widower.

380
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:19,260
<19-3,CASTLE>只不过这次没有尸体
<19-3,CASTLE>Only this time, there's no body.

381
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,500
<19-3,CASTLE>他是想制造伊娃还活着的假象
<19-3,CASTLE>He's trying to create the illusion that Eva's still alive.

382
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,960
<19-4,ESPOSITO>是的  他为了让这假象显得真实
<19-4,ESPOSITO>Yeah, and he's going to some major trouble

383
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,820
<19-4,ESPOSITO>还真是煞费苦心
<19-4,ESPOSITO>to make that illusion seem real.

384
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:26,410
<19-4,ESPOSITO>卡塞尔  你之前说科尔·威特福德
<19-4,ESPOSITO>Castle, you said that Cole Whitfield

385
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:28,390
<19-4,ESPOSITO>今早是在韦斯切斯特的家里  对吧
<19-4,ESPOSITO>was at home in Westchester this morning, right?

386
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:29,410
<19-5,CASTLE>没错  他一直没离开过
<19-5,CASTLE>That's right. He never left.

387
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:31,530
<19-6,ESPOSITO>根据我刚刚从伊娃的手机里获得的数据
<19-6,ESPOSITO>Well, I just got the data back from Eva's phone.

388
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:34,300
<19-6,ESPOSITO>打给科尔的电话是从曼哈顿的一座信号塔传送的
<19-6,ESPOSITO>the call to Cole pinged off a tower in Manhattan.

389
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:37,280
<19-7,RYAN>他肯定是叫别人用伊娃的手机打那通电话的
<19-7,RYAN>He must have had someone use Eva's phone to make that call.

390
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,160
<19-7,RYAN>他有同谋
<19-7,RYAN>He's got an accomplice.

391
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:38,840
<19-8,ESPOSITO>不管那人是谁
<19-8,ESPOSITO>And whoever that is

392
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,360
<19-8,ESPOSITO>是在靠近第31大道和第4大道的地方打电话的
<19-8,ESPOSITO>made that call somewhere near 31st and 4th.

393
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:43,330
<19-9,CASTLE>那正好是我拍摄这些照片的地方
<19-9,CASTLE>That's where I took those photos.

394
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:45,100
<19-9,CASTLE>他的情妇泰勒就住在那附近
<19-9,CASTLE>His mistress, Taylor, lives on that block.

395
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,530
<19-10,BECKETT>如果泰勒为他的不在场证明撒了谎
<19-10,BECKETT>If Taylor lied about his alibi,

396
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:47,660
<19-10,BECKETT>或许那通电话就是她打的
<19-10,BECKETT>she might have made that phone call.

397
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,010
<19-10,BECKETT>你们去把她请来警局一趟吧
<19-10,BECKETT>Why don't you guys go and pick her up?

398
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:50,240
<19-11,ESPOSITO>该死  那我只能取消
<19-11,ESPOSITO>Oh, damn, that means I'm gonna have to cancel

399
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,360
<19-12,RYAN>-跟史黛西的午餐之约了  -你不能取消
<19-12,RYAN>- that lunch date with Stacy, bro. - No, no, no, no, no, you can't.

400
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:55,940
<19-12,RYAN>你必须留下良好的第一印象
<19-12,RYAN>Uh, you have to make a good first impression.

401
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:57,110
<19-13,BECKETT>老天啊  算了
<19-13,BECKETT>Oh, for heaven's sake. You know what?

402
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:59,820
<19-13,BECKETT>你去约会吧  莱恩和我去带她过来
<19-13,BECKETT>Go enjoy your date. Ryan and I will go and get her.

403
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:03,540
<20-1,TAYLOR>我已经回答过你们所有的问题了
<20-1,TAYLOR>I already answered all your questions.

404
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,080
<20-2,BECKETT>现在我们有更多的问题了
<20-2,BECKETT>And now we have more

405
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,700
<20-2,BECKETT>因为现在出现了新的信息
<20-2,BECKETT>Because new information has come to light.

406
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:09,000
<20-3,TAYLOR>什么新信息
<20-3,TAYLOR>What new information?

407
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,660
<20-4,BECKETT>在谈到那个之前  我想再重复一下
<20-4,BECKETT>Before we get to that, I'd like to revisit

408
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,540
<20-4,BECKETT>我们上次见面时  你所说的话
<20-4,BECKETT>something that you said at our last meeting.

409
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:14,890
<20-4,BECKETT>你说从昨晚6点到8点
<20-4,BECKETT>You said that Cole was at your apartment

410
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:17,390
<20-4,BECKETT>科尔都在你的公寓里
<20-4,BECKETT>between 6:00 and 8:00 last night.

411
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:18,840
<20-4,BECKETT>你现在仍坚持这种说法不变吗
<20-4,BECKETT>Are you still saying that now?

412
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,970
<20-5,TAYLOR>是的
<20-5,TAYLOR>Yep.

413
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,650
<20-6,BECKETT>但你的邻居都说没看见他
<20-6,BECKETT>None of your neighbors saw him.

414
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:23,350
<20-7,TAYLOR>他这人做事很谨慎小心
<20-7,TAYLOR>Well, he's very discreet.

415
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:26,250
<20-8,BECKETT>是他叫你说他当时在你的公寓里的吗
<20-8,BECKETT>Did he tell you to say that he was at your apartment?

416
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:28,140
<19-12,RYAN>不是
<19-12,RYAN>No.

417
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:31,290
<20-10,BECKETT>他有没有叫你用别人的手机给他打电话
<20-10,BECKETT>Did he ask you to call him from someone else's cellphone?

418
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:33,270
<20-11,AUBREY HASKINS>泰勒  什么都别说了
<20-11,AUBREY HASKINS>Taylor, don't say another word.

419
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,150
<20-11,AUBREY HASKINS>我是奥德丽·哈斯金斯  麦金利小姐的律师
<20-11,AUBREY HASKINS>Aubrey Haskins, attorney for ms. Mckinley.

420
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:39,070
<20-12,TAYLOR>-等等  你是谁  -放心  是科尔派我来的
<20-12,TAYLOR>- Wait, who are you? - It's okay. Cole sent me.

<20-13,AUBREY>-让我来跟警方谈  -泰勒  听我说
<20-13,AUBREY>- Just let me do the talking. - Taylor, listen to me.

423
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,390
<20-14,BECKETT>如果你提供了假的不在场证明  你也会变成同谋
<20-14,BECKETT>If you provided a false alibi, that makes you an accomplice.

424
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:46,280
<20-14,BECKETT>那可是要坐牢的
<20-14,BECKETT>That means jail.

425
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,690
<20-15,AUBREY>到底是什么事的同谋啊
<20-15,AUBREY>Accomplice to what, exactly?

<20-16,BECKETT>-杀害伊娃·威特福德  -伊娃并没有死
<20-16,BECKETT>- The murder of Eva Whitfield. - Eva's not dead.

<20-17,TAYLOR>科尔今早还跟她说过话呢
<20-17,TAYLOR>Cole spoke with her this morning.

428
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:54,100
<20-18,BECKETT>或者他是跟一个用她手机的人说的话
<20-18,BECKETT>Or he spoke to someone using her cellphone.

429
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,530
<20-18,BECKETT>那通电话定位的信号塔
<20-18,BECKETT>That call pinged off of a tower

430
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:58,340
<20-18,BECKETT>就在你公寓附近  时间是上午9:35

<20-19,AUBREY>-探长  除非你有证据  -等等
<20-19,AUBREY>- Detective, unless you have proof -- wait.

432
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,170
<20-20,TAYLOR>你是在说我就是打那个电话的人吗
<20-20,TAYLOR>Are you accusing me of making that call?

433
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:06,170
<20-20,TAYLOR>我9:35时在瑜伽馆工作呢
<20-20,TAYLOR>I was at work at 9:35 at the yoga studio.

434
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:07,150
<20-21,BECKETT>泰勒  我有你的工作安排表
<20-21,BECKETT>Taylor, I've got your schedule.

435
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:08,240
<20-21,BECKETT>你上午是不工作的
<20-21,BECKETT>You don't work in the mornings.

436
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,970
<20-22,TAYLOR>本来是这样  但他们打电话叫我过去
<20-22,TAYLOR>No, but I got called in to cover

437
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,210
<20-22,TAYLOR>为另一个生病的教练代班
<20-22,TAYLOR>for another instructor who was sick.

<20-22,TAYLOR>我从上午9:30到11:00一直在那里
<20-22,TAYLOR>I was there from 9:30 a.M. to 11:00.

<20-22,TAYLOR>你可以去查的

440
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:16,480
<20-23,AUBREY>我看到此为止吧  探长
<20-23,AUBREY>We're done here, detective.

441
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,180
<21-1,CASTLE>真是狡诈的一招
<21-1,CASTLE>That was a crafty move.

442
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:32,650
<21-1,CASTLE>科尔派他的内务律师来让他的女朋友闭嘴
<21-1,CASTLE>Cole sent his in-house lawyer to silence his girlfriend.

443
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:35,000
<21-1,CASTLE>他要把这事控制在家庭范围内
<21-1,CASTLE>He's keeping this thing contained, in the family.

444
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,480
<21-2,RYAN>是啊  但现在泰勒有了律师
<21-2,RYAN>Yeah, but now that Taylor's lawyered up,

445
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,650
<21-2,RYAN>我们要怎么攻破她啊
<21-2,RYAN>How are we gonna break her?

446
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:39,170
<21-3,BECKETT>就是深挖她供述的信息
<21-3,BECKETT>By digging into her story.

447
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:41,430
<21-3,BECKETT>我打去她工作的地方  核实下她的不在场证明
<21-3,BECKETT>I'll call her work and check into her alibi.

448
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,040
<21-5,RYAN>小伙伴  约会进行得怎么样啊
<21-5,RYAN>Partner. How did the date go?

449
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,850
<21-6,ESPOSITO>我们能到这边来谈吗
<21-6,ESPOSITO>Can we talk about it out here?

450
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,550
<22-1,RYAN>你觉得史黛西怎么样
<22-1,RYAN>What did you think of Stacy?

451
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:51,100
<22-2,ESPOSITO>天啊  她真的很赞
<22-2,ESPOSITO>Oh, man, she was great.

452
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,620
<22-4,ESPOSITO>直到后来我发现她有跟踪狂的嫌疑
<22-4,ESPOSITO>Until I started getting a stalker vibe from her.

453
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:56,080
<22-5,RYAN>-什么  -没错  当时我们正在吃开胃菜
<22-5,RYAN>- What? - Yeah, we were right in the middle of appetizers,

454
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,850
<22-6,ESPOSITO>然后她告诉我  我在三项全能运动比赛中
<22-6,ESPOSITO>And that's when she told me that the blue shorts

455
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:59,410
<22-6,ESPOSITO>穿的那件蓝色短裤
<22-6,ESPOSITO>I was wearing during the triathlon

456
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:01,750
<22-6,ESPOSITO>让我的腿显得很性感  那倒是实话
<22-6,ESPOSITO>made my legs look sexy, which is true,

457
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:04,660
<22-6,ESPOSITO>但她怎么知道我参赛了
<22-6,ESPOSITO>But how did she even know I competed,

458
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,140
<22-6,ESPOSITO>更别提我当时穿的是什么颜色的短裤了
<22-6,ESPOSITO>never mind what color shorts I was wearing?

459
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:08,220
<22-6,ESPOSITO>就在那时她告诉我
<22-6,ESPOSITO>And that's when she told me

460
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:11,010
<22-6,ESPOSITO>她是在我的个人资料里看到那张照片的
<22-6,ESPOSITO>that she saw the photo on my profile.

461
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:14,490
<22-7,ESPOSITO>你觉得这很好笑吗
<22-7,ESPOSITO>Oh, this is funny to you?

462
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:17,540
<22-7,ESPOSITO>你居然偷偷替我注册了配对网账号
<22-7,ESPOSITO>You signed me up for Match.com behind my back?

463
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:18,550
<22-8,RYAN>算起来应该是珍妮干的
<22-8,RYAN>Well, technically, Jenny did.

464
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:21,430
<22-8,RYAN>我只是帮你修改了下资料
<22-8,RYAN>I've, I've only been managing your profile.

465
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:23,120
<22-9,ESPOSITO>你觉得我不会发现吗
<22-9,ESPOSITO>Did you think I wouldn't find out?

466
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,770
<22-9,ESPOSITO>我差点抓了那女孩
<22-9,ESPOSITO>I almost arrested that girl.

467
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:27,340
<22-10,RYAN>我们以为你会不可自拔地迷上她
<22-10,RYAN>Well, we were hoping that you'd be so into her

468
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,640
<22-10,RYAN>然后把这事忘了
<22-10,RYAN>that you'd just let it go.

469
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,550
<22-11,ESPOSITO>你哪根筋不对  我自己能找到约会对象
<22-11,ESPOSITO>What the hell is wrong with you? I can find my own dates.

470
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,090
<22-12,RYAN>我知道你能  可你还没找到呢
<22-12,RYAN>I know, but you haven't.

471
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:35,690
<22-12,RYAN>而周末的滑雪之行就要到了  所以
<22-12,RYAN>And the ski weekend is coming up, so...

472
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:36,860
<22-12,RYAN>听我说
<22-12,RYAN>Look, look, look, look.

473
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,370
<22-12,RYAN>我们只是想帮你而已
<22-12,RYAN>We were just trying to help.

474
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,150
<22-13,ESPOSITO>我不需要你们帮我
<22-13,ESPOSITO>I don't need your help.

475
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,340
<22-13,ESPOSITO>这事没完
<22-13,ESPOSITO>This isn't over.

476
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:51,640
<23-1,BECKETT>瑜伽中心的经理证实
<23-1,BECKETT>The manager at the yoga studio

477
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,180
<23-1,BECKETT>泰勒那天确实是从早上九点半
<23-1,BECKETT>verified that Taylor was at work from 9:30

478
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:56,220
<23-2,CASTLE>-工作到十一点  -经理在说谎
<23-2,CASTLE>- till 11:00 A.M. - Then the manager's lying.

479
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:58,840
<23-3,BECKETT>卡塞尔  她带的班可有30个人
<23-3,BECKETT>Castle, she had a classroom full of 30 people.

480
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,050
<23-3,BECKETT>电话不是她打的
<23-3,BECKETT>She didn't make that call,

481
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:01,890
<23-3,BECKETT>打电话的人肯定算准了
<23-3,BECKETT>but whoever did made sure to do it

482
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,340
<23-3,BECKETT>自己就在泰勒那栋楼旁边
<23-3,BECKETT>right by Taylor's building.

483
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,300
<23-4,CASTLE>有人想把我们的注意力转移到泰勒身上
<23-4,CASTLE>Which means someone wants us to believe it was Taylor.

484
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,750
<23-4,CASTLE>如果她不是临时被叫去上班
<23-4,CASTLE>And we would have

485
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:08,840
<23-5,BECKETT>我们的确会这么认为
<23-5,BECKETT>if she didn't get called into work.

486
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:11,580
<23-6,CASTLE>被叫去上班
<23-6,CASTLE>Called into work.

487
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,260
<23-6,CASTLE>当然了
<23-6,CASTLE>Of course.

488
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,670
<23-6,CASTLE>泰勒被叫去上班
<23-6,CASTLE>Taylor getting called into work

489
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:16,970
<23-6,CASTLE>这件事是幕后黑手
<23-6,CASTLE>is the one thing the person behind this

490
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:18,440
<23-6,CASTLE>无法预料到的
<23-6,CASTLE>couldn't have foreseen.

491
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,350
<23-7,BECKETT>-那个人就是科尔 -不是
<23-7,BECKETT>- That person being Cole. - No.

492
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:21,730
<23-9,BECKETT>-不是吗  -不是
<23-9,BECKETT>- No? - No.

493
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,540
<23-10,CASTLE>贝克特  这场谋杀是被设计好的
<23-10,CASTLE>Beckett, the murder was staged.

494
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:26,940
<23-10,CASTLE>整件事就像小说一样
<23-10,CASTLE>This whole thing, it's a work of fiction.

495
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,460
<23-10,CASTLE>这就是部希区柯克经典电影
<23-10,CASTLE>I-it's a Hitchcock movie with me

496
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,350
<23-10,CASTLE>而我扮演目击者
<23-10,CASTLE>cast as the witness.

497
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:30,920
<23-10,CASTLE>我就是《迷魂记》里的吉米·斯图尔特
<23-10,CASTLE>I'm Jimmy Stewart in "Vertigo."

498
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,620
<23-10,CASTLE>我们之所以没找到尸体
<23-10,CASTLE>The reason we haven't found a body

499
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:35,660
<23-10,CASTLE>是因为根本就没有尸体
<23-10,CASTLE>is because there is no body.

500
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:37,520
<23-10,CASTLE>伊娃还活着
<23-10,CASTLE>Eva's still alive.

501
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:38,440
<23-11,BECKETT>伊娃还活着
<23-11,BECKETT>Eva's alive?

502
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,380
<23-11,BECKETT>卡塞尔  之前你明明不是这么想的
<23-11,BECKETT>Castle, that's not what you believed a moment ago.

503
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,110
<23-12,CASTLE>我刚刚才反应过来
<23-12,CASTLE>It didn't hit me until just now.

504
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:44,070
<23-12,CASTLE>伊娃想让科尔看起来像凶手
<23-12,CASTLE>Eva is the one person who would want Cole

505
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:46,850
<23-12,CASTLE>而他的情人看起来像共犯
<23-12,CASTLE>to look like a murderer and his mistress an accomplice.

506
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:49,140
<23-13,BECKETT>你目睹科尔杀了伊娃
<23-13,BECKETT>Wait, you saw Cole kill Eva.

507
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,890
<23-13,BECKETT>你确实看到了  不是吗
<23-13,BECKETT>I mean, y-you did, didn't you?

508
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:53,780
<23-14,CASTLE>我看见的是她想让我看见的
<23-14,CASTLE>I saw what she wanted me to see.

509
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:57,660
<23-14,CASTLE>这就是为何那晚她想让我把照片送过去
<23-14,CASTLE>That's why she wanted me to drop off the photos that night.

510
00:23:57,910 --> 00:23:59,580
<23-14,CASTLE>伊娃策划好了这一切
<23-14,CASTLE>Eva's been behind this from the start,

511
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:02,420
<23-14,CASTLE>而我是电影里那个易骗的私家侦探
<23-14,CASTLE>and I'm the gullible P.I. that fell for it.

512
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,190
<23-15,BECKETT>她为什么要如此大费周章
<23-15,BECKETT>Why would she go to that length?

513
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:07,370
<23-16,CASTLE>因为伊娃要的不只是婚姻
<23-16,CASTLE>Because Eva wanted more than just out of the marriage.

514
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:09,550
<23-16,CASTLE>她想让科尔受尽折磨
<23-16,CASTLE>She wanted Cole to suffer.

515
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,830
<23-16,CASTLE>她设局陷害他
<23-16,CASTLE>She set him up.

516
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,140
<23-16,CASTLE>他说她打电话给他
<23-16,CASTLE>He swore that she called him

517
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:15,950
<23-16,CASTLE>因为她确实打了电话
<23-16,CASTLE>because she did call him.

518
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:16,760
<23-16,CASTLE>她还向瑞士银行账号里
<23-16,CASTLE>She also transferred

519
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:19,770
<23-16,CASTLE>转了740万美金
<23-16,CASTLE>the $7.4 million to the Swiss bank account.

520
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:21,410
<23-17,CASTLE>那是她逃之夭夭的钱
<23-17,CASTLE>It's her walking-away money.

521
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:23,520
<23-17,CASTLE>贝克特  我是对的
<23-17,CASTLE>I'm telling you, Beckett, I am right about this.

523
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,140
<23-17,CASTLE>什么时候
<23-17,CASTLE>When?

524
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,930
<23-18,BECKETT>好的  谢谢
<23-18,BECKETT>Okay. Thanks.

525
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,790
<23-18,BECKETT>卡塞尔  很抱歉  但是
<23-18,BECKETT>Castle, I'm sorry but--

526
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:34,040
<23-19,CASTLE>不  贝克特  我知道听上去很奇怪
<23-19,CASTLE>No, Beckett, I know it sounds crazy,

527
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:35,540
<23-19,CASTLE>但伊娃还活着
<23-19,CASTLE>but Eva is still alive.

528
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,790
<23-19,CASTLE>她死了
<23-19,CASTLE>No, she's not.

529
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,210
<23-20,BECKETT>他们在哈德逊河发现了她的尸体
<23-20,BECKETT>They found her body in the Hudson.

530
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:40,480
<23-20,BECKETT>伊娃死了
<23-20,BECKETT>Eva's dead.

531
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:48,650
<24-1,CASTLE>伊娃不可能真死
<24-1,CASTLE>There is no way Eva is really dead.

532
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:51,840
<24-1,CASTLE>希区柯克的经典电影里  这不会是她的尸体
<24-1,CASTLE>In a classic Hitchcockian twist, it won't be her body.

533
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:52,700
<24-1,CASTLE>记好了
<24-1,CASTLE>Mark my words.

534
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,520
<24-2,BECKETT>那我们从河里捞上来的是什么
<24-2,BECKETT>Then who did we pull out of the river?

535
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,460
<24-3,CASTLE>伊娃的替身
<24-3,CASTLE>Someone who can pass for Eva.

536
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,200
<24-4,BECKETT>那我们就测一下她的指纹
<24-4,BECKETT>Okay, we'll run her prints.

537
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,270
<24-4,BECKETT>这能够说明她到底是谁了
<24-4,BECKETT>That should clear up whether it's Eva or not.

538
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,950
<24-5,CASTLE>只不过她的指纹已经被换掉
<24-5,CASTLE>Except her prints will be altered,

539
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:03,010
<24-5,CASTLE>脸部无法辨认
<24-5,CASTLE>her face, unrecognizable,

540
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:05,530
<24-5,CASTLE>伊娃的完美犯罪计划
<24-5,CASTLE>all part of Eva's plan to commit the perfect crime.

541
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:07,540
<24-5,CASTLE>你会明白的
<24-5,CASTLE>You'll see.

542
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:17,180
<25-1,CASTLE>她看起来真像伊娃
<25-1,CASTLE>Whoa. She looks just like Eva.

543
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:19,010
<25-2,LANIE>那是因为她就是伊娃
<25-2,LANIE>That's because it is Eva.

544
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:21,490
<25-2,LANIE>指纹吻合  她就是你们要找的人
<25-2,LANIE>Her prints match. This is your girl.

545
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:23,200
<25-3,CASTLE>这不可能
<25-3,CASTLE>No, it can't be.

546
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,290
<25-4,LANIE>我还查了她的牙科记录  卡塞尔  就是她
<25-4,LANIE>I checked her dental records, too, Castle. It's her.

547
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,340
<25-4,LANIE>我也希望我能说不是她
<25-4,LANIE>I wish I could tell you it wasn't.

548
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:30,400
<25-5,BECKETT>我觉得死因是
<25-5,BECKETT>I take it that the cause of death

549
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,710
<25-5,BECKETT>遭到钝物重击
<25-5,BECKETT>is blunt-force trauma.

550
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,720
<25-6,LANIE>看起来顶骨区域
<25-6,LANIE>It looks like a massive skull fracture

551
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:36,290
<25-6,LANIE>出现大面积骨折  不过尸体才送来
<25-6,LANIE>in the parietal region, but she just came in,

552
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:38,110
<25-6,LANIE>我只做了初步检测
<25-6,LANIE>so I've only done a preliminary exam.

553
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,470
<25-6,LANIE>一旦验尸完成  我会打电话给你
<25-6,LANIE>Once I've finished my autopsy, I'll give you a call.

554
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,440
<25-7,BECKETT>好的
<25-7,BECKETT>Okay.

555
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,430
<25-8,BECKETT>卡塞尔  对于你朋友的事我很抱歉
<25-8,BECKETT>Castle, I'm sorry about your friend.

556
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,660
<25-9,CASTLE>我也是
<25-9,CASTLE>Yeah, me too.

557
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,280
<25-10,BECKETT>现在我们有了尸体  也许有了些优势
<25-10,BECKETT>Now that we have a body, maybe that will give us some leverage.

558
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:01,530
<26-1,RYAN>泰勒  我们得谈谈
<26-1,RYAN>Taylor, we need to talk.

559
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:03,350
<26-2,TAYLOR>我的律师让我不要跟你说话
<26-2,TAYLOR>My lawyer said not to speak with you.

560
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:05,100
<26-3,ESPOSITO>那好  听我说就行
<26-3,ESPOSITO>Fine. Then just listen.

561
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:06,500
<26-4,RYAN>我不知道科尔跟你说了什么
<26-4,RYAN>I don't know what Cole told you,

562
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,280
<26-4,RYAN>不过他妻子死了
<26-4,RYAN>but his wife is dead.

563
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,370
<26-4,RYAN>不到两小时前  她的尸体被人发现了
<26-4,RYAN>Her body was found less than two hours ago.

564
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,890
<26-5,TAYLOR>天呐
<26-5,TAYLOR>Oh, my God.

565
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:13,990
<26-6,ESPOSITO>泰勒
<26-6,ESPOSITO>Listen, Taylor,

566
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:15,810
<26-6,ESPOSITO>如果你想免受牢狱之灾
<26-6,ESPOSITO>if you want to stay out of prison,

567
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,750
<26-6,ESPOSITO>是时候坦白了
<26-6,ESPOSITO>now's the time to tell us the truth.

568
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:26,550
<27-1,BECKETT>哈斯金斯小姐  欢迎回来
<27-1,BECKETT>Ms. Haskins, welcome back.

569
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:30,410
<27-1,BECKETT>看起来本案中你代表所有人啊
<27-1,BECKETT>You seem to be representing everyone in this matter.

570
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:32,900
<27-2,AUBREY>在开始之前
<27-2,AUBREY>Before we begin,

571
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:35,280
<27-2,AUBREY>威特福德先生来此的唯一目的
<27-2,AUBREY>Mr. Whitfield is here only because you said

572
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,390
<27-2,AUBREY>是因为你们声称有他妻子的下落
<27-2,AUBREY>you have information on his wife's whereabouts.

573
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:40,230
<27-3,BECKETT>科尔  你说你今早和伊娃说了话
<27-3,BECKETT>Cole, you said that you spoke with Eva this morning.

574
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,290
<27-3,BECKETT>她说什么了
<27-3,BECKETT>What did she say?

575
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,830
<27-4,COLE>她说一切都结束了  她要离开这里
<27-4,COLE>She said it was over and that she was leaving town.

576
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:47,110
<27-5,AUBREY>警探  你到底找到威特福德夫人没有
<27-5,AUBREY>Detective, did you find Mrs. Whitfield or not?

577
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,580
<27-6,BECKETT>我们在哈德逊河找到了她的尸体
<27-6,BECKETT>Oh, we found her... in the Hudson...

578
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:52,930
<27-6,BECKETT>她是你杀的
<27-6,BECKETT>murdered by you.

579
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:54,530
<27-7,COLE>那是个谎言
<27-7,COLE>That's a lie.

580
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:56,150
<27-8,BECKETT>泰勒已经把你供出来了
<27-8,BECKETT>Taylor gave you up.

581
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,640
<27-8,BECKETT>她说昨晚你并没有跟她在一起
<27-8,BECKETT>She said that you weren't with her last night.

582
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:01,000
<27-9,AUBREY>没有我在场你就跟我的当事人谈话了吗
<27-9,AUBREY>You spoke to my client without me?

583
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,140
<27-10,BECKETT>她放弃了她的权利
<27-10,BECKETT>She waived her right.

584
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:04,500
<27-10,BECKETT>威特福德先生  如果昨晚你没有跟泰勒在一起
<27-10,BECKETT>Mr. Whitfield, if you weren't with Taylor last night,

585
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,240
<27-10,BECKETT>-那你在哪里  -不要回答
<27-10,BECKETT>- then where were you? - Don't answer that.

586
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:08,330
<27-11,AUBREY>你要提出起诉吗
<27-11,AUBREY>Are you pressing charges?

587
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:11,500
<27-12,BECKETT>无法避免了  是的
<27-12,BECKETT>Inevitably, yeah.

588
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:13,130
<27-13,AUBREY>科尔  我们走
<27-13,AUBREY>Cole, let's go.

589
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,240
<28-3,CASTLE>我知道是你干的
<28-3,CASTLE>I know you did it.

590
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:28,310
<28-4,AUBREY>-不许你跟我的当事人说话  -是你杀了她
<28-4,AUBREY>- Do not speak to my client. - You killed her.

591
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,260
<28-5,CASTLE>我看见你了
<28-5,CASTLE>I saw you.

592
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:30,340
<28-6,BECKETT>卡塞尔  卡塞尔
<28-6,BECKETT>Castle, Castle, hey.

593
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,420
<28-7,AUBREY>警官  你们这算是什么警局
<28-7,AUBREY>Detective, what the hell kind of precinct is this?

594
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,140
<28-8,BECKETT>带上你的当事人赶紧离开
<28-8,BECKETT>Just take your client and go home.

595
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:36,760
<28-8,BECKETT>-用不了多久我们还会去找你的  -我们走
<28-8,BECKETT>- We'll be coming back for you soon enough. - Let's go.

596
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:41,800
<28-10,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你在干什么
<28-10,BECKETT>Castle, what was that?

597
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,500
<28-11,CASTLE>我知道这样不对  对不起
<28-11,CASTLE>I know. I know. I'm sorry.

598
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,930
<28-12,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你压力太大了  回家休息一下
<28-12,BECKETT>Castle, you're stressed. Go home and try to relax.

599
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:47,860
<28-13,CASTLE>我会没事的
<28-13,CASTLE>I'll be fine.

600
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:50,370
<28-14,BECKETT>我知道  不过现在你必须赶紧离开
<28-14,BECKETT>I know you will. But right now, you just need to walk away.

601
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,350
<28-15,CASTLE>是啊
<28-15,CASTLE>Yeah.

602
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:54,390
<28-15,CASTLE>是啊  你说得对
<28-15,CASTLE>Yeah, you're right.

603
00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:55,790
<28-16,BECKETT>好的
<28-16,BECKETT>Okay.

604
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:00,690
<28-17,BECKETT>蕾妮  有什么发现
<28-17,BECKETT>Lanie, what do you got?

605
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:02,590
<29-1,LANIE>在尸检过程中  我发现
<29-1,LANIE>During the autopsy, I discovered

606
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,180
<29-1,LANIE>伊娃左手食指的指甲
<29-1,LANIE>that Eva's fingernail on her left index

607
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:07,020
<29-1,LANIE>从中间断开了
<29-1,LANIE>had been split down the middle.

608
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:11,630
<29-1,LANIE>有三根头发被夹在裂缝当中
<29-1,LANIE>Wedged in that crack were these three hairs.

609
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:16,020
<29-2,BECKETT>这些头发一定是在挣扎中留下的
<29-2,BECKETT>These hairs must have gotten transferred during the struggle.

610
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,180
<29-3,LANIE>差不多
<29-3,LANIE>Most likely.

611
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,310
<29-4,BECKETT>蕾妮  最快多久可以检测出结果
<29-4,BECKETT>Lanie, how fast can you test these?

612
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,860
<29-4,BECKETT>科尔被怀疑杀害
<29-4,BECKETT>Cole's DNA is still on file

613
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,170
<29-4,BECKETT>其第一任妻子的档案中还留有他的DNA
<29-4,BECKETT>from when he was suspected of murdering his first wife.

614
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,700
<29-5,LANIE>我已经检测过了  结果相吻合
<29-5,LANIE>I already ran them, and they're a match.

615
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,110
<29-5,LANIE>科尔·威特福德就是凶手
<29-5,LANIE>Cole Whitfield is your man.

616
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,170
<30-1,OFFICER KEMP>威特福德先生
<30-1,OFFICER KEMP>Mr. Whitfield!

617
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:36,770
<30-1,OFFICER KEMP>威特福德先生  我们奉令逮捕你
<30-1,OFFICER KEMP>Mr. Whitfield, we have a warrant for your arrest.

618
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,500
<30-2,NEELY>没有回应  前门和后门都没有
<30-2,NEELY>No answer, not a the front or the back.

619
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,670
<30-3,BECKETT>他的越野车还在车道上
<30-3,BECKETT>His S.U.V.'s in the driveway.

620
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:48,220
<30-4,OFFICER KEMP>-需要破门吗  -没那个必要
<30-4,OFFICER KEMP>- Should we take the door? - There's no need.

621
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:51,650
<30-1,OFFICER KEMP>威特福德先生
<30-1,OFFICER KEMP>Mr. Whitfield?

622
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:53,820
<30-6,NEELY>别躲了
<30-6,NEELY>Show yourself.

623
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,790
<30-6,NEELY>不要再做无畏的抵抗了
<30-6,NEELY>Let's not make this harder than it has to be.

624
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:31,210
<31-1,BECKETT>你没事吧
<31-1,BECKETT>Are you doing okay?

625
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:34,720
<31-2,CASTLE>我只是没想到这个故事会以这样的形式终结
<31-2,CASTLE>I just never thought the story would end like this.

626
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:36,140
<31-3,BECKETT>是的  我猜科尔也没想到
<31-3,BECKETT>Yeah, I bet Cole didn't either.

627
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,590
<31-4,CASTLE>是的  可是自杀
<31-4,CASTLE>Yeah, but suicide?

628
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:39,790
<31-4,CASTLE>法医怎么说
<31-4,CASTLE>What did the M.E. say?

629
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:42,100
<31-5,BECKETT>看起来是他自己把绳子套在脖子上的
<31-5,BECKETT>That it looks like he wrapped the cord around his neck

630
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:43,740
<31-5,BECKETT>然后从阳台跳下来了
<31-5,BECKETT>and stepped off the balcony.

631
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:45,310
<31-5,BECKETT>我很抱歉
<31-5,BECKETT>Look, I'm sorry.

632
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,530
<31-5,BECKETT>我知道这不是你想要的结局
<31-5,BECKETT>I know that this isn't how you wanted it to end.

633
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:57,970
<32-1,CASTLE>贝克特
<32-1,CASTLE>Beckett?

634
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:01,330
<32-1,CASTLE>贝克特  你还没睡吗
<32-1,CASTLE>Beckett, are you still awake?

635
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:03,390
<32-2,BECKETT>睡了
<32-2,BECKETT>No.

636
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,270
<32-3,CASTLE>太好了  有些事让我心烦
<32-3,CASTLE>Good. Something's bothering me.

637
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:07,550
<32-4,BECKETT>是吗  有些人也让我很心烦
<32-4,BECKETT>Yeah? Something's bothering me, too.

638
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,680
<32-5,CASTLE>像科尔那样的人怎么会自杀呢
<32-5,CASTLE>Why would a guy like Cole commit suicide?

639
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:11,660
<32-6,BECKETT>因为像科尔那样的人
<32-6,BECKETT>Because a guy like Cole

640
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,320
<32-6,BECKETT>面对不了入狱的局面
<32-6,BECKETT>didn't think he could face going to prison.

641
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:15,090
<32-7,CASTLE>像他那样富有且关系网庞大的人
<32-7,CASTLE>As wealthy and connected as he was?

642
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:16,700
<32-7,CASTLE>真的可能会进监狱吗
<32-7,CASTLE>W-would he have even gone to prison?

643
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:19,400
<32-7,CASTLE>案件中针对他的证据都是间接的
<32-7,CASTLE>The case against him was circumstantial.

644
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,840
<32-7,CASTLE>他完全有可能在法庭上打赢官司
<32-7,CASTLE>He could have beaten it in court.

645
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,640
<32-8,BECKETT>很显然  他不这样认为
<32-8,BECKETT>Well, evidently, he didn't think so.

646
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,190
<32-9,CASTLE>做得太干净了
<32-9,CASTLE>It's too clean.

647
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:28,120
<32-10,BECKETT>卡塞尔  别再胡思乱想了
<32-10,BECKETT>Castle, stop chasing the mice in your head.

648
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,980
<32-11,CASTLE>可是万一它们指引我走向真相呢
<32-11,CASTLE>But what if they're leading me to the truth?

649
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:32,350
<32-12,BECKETT>那等我们明早再研究吧
<32-12,BECKETT>Then we'll deal with it in the morning.

651
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:05,310
<32-12,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<32-12,BECKETT>Castle?

652
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:08,270
<33-1,BECKETT>来的路上给你带了咖啡
<33-1,BECKETT>Hey, I brought you some coffee on my way to --

653
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:13,580
<33-2,BECKETT>看来你肯定不需要什么咖啡了
<33-2,BECKETT>You definitely don't need any more coffee.

654
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:15,930
<33-2,BECKETT>这是什么
<33-2,BECKETT>What is this?

655
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,040
<33-3,CASTLE>时间线
<33-3,CASTLE>Uh, timeline.

656
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:21,500
<33-3,CASTLE>红线是伊娃  绿线是科尔  蓝线是泰勒
<33-3,CASTLE>Eva is red, Cole is green, and Taylor is blue.

657
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,660
<33-4,BECKETT>已经结案的案子的时间线吗
<33-4,BECKETT>A timeline for a case that's closed?

658
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:25,590
<33-5,CASTLE>还没结案  科尔并不是自杀
<33-5,CASTLE>Not yet. Cole didn't kill himself.

659
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,200
<33-6,BECKETT>有什么根据
<33-6,BECKETT>Based on what?

660
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,880
<33-7,CASTLE>根据他的性格
<33-7,CASTLE>Based on his personality.

661
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:31,310
<33-7,CASTLE>科尔很自大  自视甚高
<33-7,CASTLE>Cole is cocky. He's entitled.

662
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:33,810
<33-7,CASTLE>他那么自恋  绝不可能会自杀
<33-7,CASTLE>He's far too much of a narcissist to commit suicide.

663
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:36,900
<33-7,CASTLE>如果他不是自杀  那就说明他是被谋杀的
<33-7,CASTLE>So if he didn't kill himself, that means he was murdered.

664
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:38,910
<33-8,BECKETT>卡塞尔  这个假设真的很大
<33-8,BECKETT>Castle, that's a pretty big "If."

665
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:40,200
<33-9,CASTLE>会改变一切
<33-9,CASTLE>It changes everything.

666
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,820
<33-9,CASTLE>因为如果科尔不是自杀
<33-9,CASTLE>Because if Cole didn't kill himself,

667
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:43,680
<33-9,CASTLE>那就说明伊娃不是他杀的
<33-9,CASTLE>it follows that he didn't murder Eva.

668
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:44,690
<33-9,CASTLE>凶手另有其人
<33-9,CASTLE>Someone else did.

669
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:46,810
<33-9,CASTLE>所以他的死被伪装成自杀
<33-9,CASTLE>That's why he was staged to look like a suicide,

670
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:49,730
<33-9,CASTLE>这样警察就会得出他畏罪自杀的结论
<33-9,CASTLE>so the police would conclude that he was the guilty party.

671
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:52,670
<33-10,BECKETT>杀害科尔的人也杀了伊娃
<33-10,BECKETT>Then whoever killed Cole also killed Eva.

672
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:53,660
<33-10,BECKETT>谁会做这些事呢
<33-10,BECKETT>And who would that be?

673
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:54,980
<33-11,CASTLE>那个假装袭击她的人
<33-11,CASTLE>The man I saw "Attacking" her.

674
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,440
<33-11,CASTLE>也是在树林里打晕我的那个人
<33-11,CASTLE>Whoever hit me in the woods.

675
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,180
<33-12,BECKETT>可你说袭击她的人是科尔
<33-12,BECKETT>Who you said was Cole.

676
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:01,040
<33-13,CASTLE>他让我相信那个人是科尔
<33-13,CASTLE>He wanted me to believe he was Cole.

677
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:02,290
<33-13,CASTLE>那都是在演戏
<33-13,CASTLE>It was just all theater.

678
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:04,240
<33-14,BECKETT>好吧  卡塞尔  假设
<33-14,BECKETT>Okay, Castle, let's say for a second,

679
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,570
<33-14,BECKETT>有人溜进房子假扮成科尔
<33-14,BECKETT>that someone snuck into the house disguised as Cole,

680
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:09,110
<33-14,BECKETT>袭击了伊娃  可是他怎么会知道
<33-14,BECKETT>and attacked Eva. How could they possibly know

681
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:11,100
<33-14,BECKETT>那时刚好你会在那里目击这一切呢
<33-14,BECKETT>that you were gonna be there to witness it?

682
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:12,980
<33-15,CASTLE>他一定是跟伊娃串通好的
<33-15,CASTLE>Well, he had to have been in on it with Eva.

683
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:16,720
<33-16,BECKETT>如果伊娃策划了这一切  那她为什么会死呢
<33-16,BECKETT>If Eva is a part of the setup, then why is she in the morgue?

684
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:19,880
<33-17,CASTLE>因为这是希区柯克式的反转
<33-17,CASTLE>Because, in classic Hitchcock fashion,

685
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:21,780
<33-17,CASTLE>她的同谋者出卖了她
<33-17,CASTLE>her co-conspirator double-crossed her.

686
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:25,160
<33-18,BECKETT>"威特福德和加罗威公司的企业章程"
<33-18,BECKETT>"The articles of incorporation for Whitfield & Galloway."

687
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,060
<33-18,BECKETT>科尔的公司吗
<33-18,BECKETT>Cole's company?

688
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:27,470
<33-19,CASTLE>我用了两盒甜甜圈
<33-19,CASTLE>It took me two boxes of cronuts

689
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:29,330
<33-19,CASTLE>从办事员的办公室弄到这个
<33-19,CASTLE>to get that out of the county clerk's office.

690
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,210
<33-19,CASTLE>科尔和他的合伙人斯科特·加罗威
<33-19,CASTLE>See, Cole and his partner Scott Galloway

691
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:34,410
<33-19,CASTLE>一起合作  但是章程上却写着
<33-19,CASTLE>were in business together, but in that document,

692
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:35,620
<33-19,CASTLE>万一其中一个发生什么意外
<33-19,CASTLE>it says if anything happens

693
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,550
<33-19,CASTLE>另外一个得以掌管公司
<33-19,CASTLE>to one of them, the other one gains control of the company.

694
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:39,430
<33-20,BECKETT>你是说斯科特·加罗威
<33-20,BECKETT>You're suggesting that Scott Galloway

695
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,340
<33-20,BECKETT>是伊娃的同谋者
<33-20,BECKETT>was Eva's co-conspirator.

696
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:43,630
<33-21,CASTLE>我听了我在餐厅偷录的他们的谈话
<33-21,CASTLE>I listened to the recording I made of their lunch.

697
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:45,410
<34-1,SCOTT>这获利可不小啊
<34-1,SCOTT>This could be a serious payday.

698
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:46,880
<34-2,COLE>拜托  就是些小钱  斯科特
<34-2,COLE>Please, it's chump change, Scott.

699
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,400
<34-3,ROBERT>别耍滑头  科尔
<34-3,ROBERT>Now, d-d-don't be glib, Cole.

700
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:51,050
<34-3,ROBERT>有人出高价收购他们的公司
<34-3,ROBERT>They were getting a major offer to buyout their firm,

701
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:53,050
<34-3,ROBERT>科尔不赞同被收购
<34-3,ROBERT>An offer that Cole was against,

702
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:54,810
<35-1,CASTLE>于是我对斯科特·加罗威进行了信用核查
<35-1,CASTLE>so I did a credit check on Scott Galloway.

703
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:56,620
<35-1,CASTLE>他欠下巨额债款
<35-1,CASTLE>He was in massive debt.

704
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,820
<35-1,CASTLE>被收购可以解决他的窘境
<35-1,CASTLE>A buyout would have fixed all that.

705
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:00,210
<35-1,CASTLE>但想要收购顺利进行
<35-1,CASTLE>But in order for that to happen,

706
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:02,130
<35-1,CASTLE>他需要掌控公司
<35-1,CASTLE>he needed control of the company.

707
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:05,430
<35-1,CASTLE>伊娃想跟他离婚  她想让科尔受到惩罚
<35-1,CASTLE>Eva wanted out of her marriage, and she wanted Cole punished.

708
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:08,150
<35-1,CASTLE>于是他们联手除掉了科尔
<35-1,CASTLE>So they teamed up to take Cole out of the picture.

709
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,120
<35-2,BECKETT>卡塞尔  没有证据支持这个推理
<35-2,BECKETT>Castle, there's no evidence that supports this.

710
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:14,640
<35-3,CASTLE>是斯科特·加罗威  一定是
<35-3,CASTLE>It was Scott Galloway. It has to be.

711
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:18,220
<35-3,CASTLE>贝克特  求你查查斯科特的不在场证明
<35-3,CASTLE>Beckett, will you please just check Scott's alibi?

712
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:19,380
<35-3,CASTLE>你会为我这么做吗
<35-3,CASTLE>Would you do that for me?

713
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:23,000
<35-4,BECKETT>我会的  但听着  伊娃是你的朋友
<35-4,BECKETT>I will. But listen to me. Eva was your friend.

714
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:25,360
<35-4,BECKETT>她来到你的办公室找你帮忙
<35-4,BECKETT>She came here to this very office and asked for your help,

715
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:27,040
<35-4,BECKETT>现在她死了  你觉得自己有责任破案
<35-4,BECKETT>and now she's dead, and you feel responsible,

716
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,690
<35-4,BECKETT>那样会让你发疯的
<35-4,BECKETT>and that can make you see ghosts.

717
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:33,640
<36-1,RYAN>我们现在开始调查斯科特·加罗威了  为什么
<36-1,RYAN>Wait, we're looking into Scott Galloway now? Why?

718
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:35,980
<36-2,ESPOSITO>所有证据不都指向科尔·威特福德是凶手吗
<36-2,ESPOSITO>I thought everything pointed to Cole Whitfield being the killer.

719
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:37,230
<36-3,BECKETT>是的
<36-3,BECKETT>It does.

720
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,000
<36-4,RYAN>就是说你相信卡塞尔的理论
<36-4,RYAN>Oh, you believe this theory of Castle's?

721
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:42,450
<36-5,BECKETT>我认为他对过太多次
<36-5,BECKETT>I believe that he's been right too many times

722
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,560
<36-5,BECKETT>不得不考虑一下
<36-5,BECKETT>not to consider it.

723
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:03,270
<37-1,BECKETT>我正想打给你呢
<37-1,BECKETT>Hey, I was just about to call you.

724
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:05,050
<37-2,CASTLE>听着  我仔细想了想
<37-2,CASTLE>Listen, I've been thinking about it,

725
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:08,030
<37-2,CASTLE>算是后见之明吧  你是对的
<37-2,CASTLE>and with the benefit of hindsight, y-you're right.

726
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,220
<37-2,CASTLE>我看得出我可能会越陷越深
<37-2,CASTLE>I can see how I might have tumbled down the rabbit hole.

727
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:12,630
<37-2,CASTLE>斯科特·加罗威可能跟整件事没有关系
<37-2,CASTLE>Scott Galloway probably has nothing to do with this.

728
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:13,880
<37-3,BECKETT>是的
<37-3,BECKETT>No, he doesn't.

729
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:16,330
<37-3,BECKETT>证实了他的不在场证明  但你说对了  卡塞尔
<37-3,BECKETT>His alibi checks out, but you were right, Castle.

730
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:18,410
<37-3,BECKETT>我们找到了证据证明科尔没有杀害伊娃
<37-3,BECKETT>We found proof that Cole didn't kill Eva.

731
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:20,460
<37-3,BECKETT>我知道是谁干的
<37-3,BECKETT>And I know who did.

732
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:25,730
<38-1,BECKETT>斯科特·加罗威洗清了嫌疑
<38-1,BECKETT>Scott Galloway is in the clear.

733
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:29,520
<38-1,BECKETT>在7点45  伊娃被袭时
<38-1,BECKETT>At 7:45, when Eva was supposedly attacked,

734
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,210
<38-1,BECKETT>他在观看儿子的篮球比赛
<38-1,BECKETT>he was at his son's basketball game.

735
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:34,150
<38-2,CASTLE>但你说找到了科尔没杀伊娃的证据  是什么
<38-2,CASTLE>But you said you had proof that Cole didn't kill Eva. What is it?

736
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,660
<38-3,ESPOSITO>你关于斯科特的推理没有成立
<38-3,ESPOSITO>Your theory about Scott didn't pan out,

737
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:36,810
<38-3,ESPOSITO>但我们还是做了尽职调查
<38-3,ESPOSITO>but we did due diligence

738
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,330
<38-3,ESPOSITO>调查了科尔生活中的其他人
<38-3,ESPOSITO>and looked at other people in Cole's life,

739
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:40,120
<38-3,ESPOSITO>然后我们找到了这个
<38-3,ESPOSITO>and that's when we found this.

740
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:42,980
<38-4,CASTLE>那是科尔的SUV吗
<38-4,CASTLE>Is that Cole's S.U.V.?

741
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:45,940
<38-5,BECKETT>是的  街道监控显示科尔在这栋房子里
<38-5,BECKETT>It is. Street cams show that Cole was in this house,

742
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:48,310
<38-5,BECKETT>在斯卡斯代尔区  从下午6点到8点
<38-5,BECKETT>which is in Scarsdale, from 6:00 and 8:00 p.m.

743
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:50,420
<38-6,RYAN>因此科尔·威特福德不可能是你所看到
<38-6,RYAN>Therefore, Cole Whitfield could not have been the man

744
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:51,700
<38-6,RYAN>袭击伊娃的那个人
<38-6,RYAN>that you saw attack eva.

745
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:53,110
<38-7,ESPOSITO>还有一个有趣的发现
<38-7,ESPOSITO>And here's another fun fact.

746
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:55,240
<38-7,ESPOSITO>科尔定期拜访那里
<38-7,ESPOSITO>Cole visited that house on a regular basis

747
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,370
<38-7,ESPOSITO>总是在下午6点到8点这个时间段
<38-7,ESPOSITO>between 6:00 and 8:00 p.m.

748
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:57,990
<38-8,CASTLE>这是谁的房子
<38-8,CASTLE>Whose house is that?

749
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,330
<38-9,BECKETT>罗伯特·詹姆斯
<38-9,BECKETT>Robert James,

750
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:02,740
<38-9,BECKETT>威特福德和加罗威公司的另一个总经理
<38-9,BECKETT>one of the other executives at Whitfield & Galloway.

751
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:03,620
<38-10,CASTLE>午餐时他也在
<38-10,CASTLE>He was at the lunch,

752
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:05,270
<38-10,CASTLE>科尔去罗伯特·詹姆斯家干什么
<38-10,CASTLE>but what was Cole doing at Robert James' house?

753
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,530
<38-11,RYAN>他不是去见罗伯特·詹姆斯的
<38-11,RYAN>Oh, he wasn't there to see Robert James.

754
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:08,210
<38-11,RYAN>我们发现他总是要在单位加班
<38-11,RYAN>Turns out, he always worked late at the office,

755
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:10,120
<38-11,RYAN>詹姆斯夫人在家
<38-11,RYAN>but Mrs. James was there.

756
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:12,960
<38-12,CASTLE>开玩笑吗
<38-12,CASTLE>Are you kidding?

757
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:16,360
<38-12,CASTLE>科尔跟同事的妻子出轨  这是第二段婚外情
<38-12,CASTLE>Cole was having a second affair with his colleague's wife?

758
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:19,190
<38-13,BECKETT>所以他才会谎称那晚所在地
<38-13,BECKETT>Which is probably why he lied about where he was that night.

759
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:20,340
<38-14,ESPOSITO>妻子承认了二人出轨
<38-14,ESPOSITO>The wife confirmed the affair,

760
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,690
<38-14,ESPOSITO>但她以为没人知道
<38-14,ESPOSITO>but she thought that nobody knew about it.

761
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:25,360
<38-15,CASTLE>凶案当晚  能确认詹姆斯在威特福德家附近吗
<38-15,CASTLE>Can we put Robert James near the Whitfield house that night?

762
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:27,570
<38-16,ESPOSITO>当然能确认
<38-16,ESPOSITO>Damn right we can.

763
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:33,050
<39-1,BECKETT>詹姆斯先生  感谢你赶过来
<39-1,BECKETT>Mr. James, uh, thank you so much for coming in.

764
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:35,430
<39-2,ROBERT>别客气  不过我不知道能帮上什么忙
<39-2,ROBERT>Of course, though I'm not quite sure how I can help you.

765
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:37,490
<39-3,BECKETT>你可以先告诉我前天晚上8点
<39-3,BECKETT>Well, you can start by telling me where you were

766
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,980
<39-3,BECKETT>你在哪里
<39-3,BECKETT>two nights ago at 8:00 p.m.

767
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:40,980
<39-4,ROBERT>我加班  在办公室
<39-4,ROBERT>Well, I work late. I was at the office.

768
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,880
<39-4,ROBERT>不  你不在
<39-4,ROBERT>No, you weren't.

769
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:48,550
<39-5,BECKETT>这是你晚上7点04在过路收费亭
<39-5,BECKETT>In fact, this is you at a tollbooth at 7:04 p.m.

770
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:50,530
<39-5,BECKETT>前往科尔位于韦斯切斯特的家
<39-5,BECKETT>heading to Cole's house in Westchester.

771
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,520
<39-5,BECKETT>不需要撒谎
<39-5,BECKETT>There is no need for lying here.

772
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:59,020
<39-5,BECKETT>当伊娃发现科尔与你老婆上了床
<39-5,BECKETT>When Eva found out that Cole was sleeping with your wife,

773
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:00,720
<39-5,BECKETT>她带着一个计划找到你
<39-5,BECKETT>She came to you with a plan.

774
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,130
<39-6,ROBERT>是的
<39-6,ROBERT>Yes.

775
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:05,870
<39-7,BECKETT>他背叛了你俩
<39-7,BECKETT>He had betrayed the both of you.

776
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:07,310
<39-7,BECKETT>你们想要报复
<39-7,BECKETT>You wanted revenge.

777
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:11,410
<39-8,ROBERT>他每天与我面对面
<39-8,ROBERT>The man looked me in the eye every day,

778
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:14,240
<39-8,ROBERT>然后去我家  上我的妻子
<39-8,ROBERT>and then he went to my home, to my wife.

779
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,600
<39-8,ROBERT>他罪有应得
<39-8,ROBERT>He deserved what he got.

780
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:22,290
<39-9,BECKETT>就是说你们策划了伊娃家发生的袭击事件
<39-9,BECKETT>So, you staged the attack on Eva in her house?

781
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:25,850
<39-10,ROBERT>是的  好让私家侦探看到
<39-10,ROBERT>Yes, so that P.I. would see it

782
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,610
<39-10,ROBERT>顺藤摸瓜联系到科尔身上
<39-10,ROBERT>and the trail would lead straight to Cole.

783
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:29,500
<39-10,ROBERT>当然  一切都是假的
<39-10,ROBERT>It was all for show, of course.

784
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,070
<39-10,ROBERT>科尔被捕
<39-10,ROBERT>Cole gets arrested,

785
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,340
<39-10,ROBERT>伊娃拿到他的钱  从此消失
<39-10,ROBERT>Eva gets his money and disappears.

786
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:35,370
<39-11,BECKETT>伊娃怎么死的呢
<39-11,BECKETT>So, how did Eva end up dead?

787
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:36,490
<39-11,BECKETT>我不知道
<39-11,BECKETT>I-I don't know.

788
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,450
<39-12,ROBERT>我第二天早晨跟她通过话
<39-12,ROBERT>I-I spoke to her the next morning.

789
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:40,930
<39-12,ROBERT>她有些焦虑  有些后悔
<39-12,ROBERT>Eva was stressed-out, regretful.

790
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,700
<39-12,ROBERT>说这出戏本来也不是她的点子
<39-12,ROBERT>Said the plan was never her idea in the first place.

791
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:44,690
<39-13,BECKETT>那是谁的
<39-13,BECKETT>Whose plan was it?

792
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:45,610
<39-13,BECKETT>不知道
<39-13,BECKETT>I don't know.

793
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:48,030
<39-14,ROBERT>但她有点打退堂鼓
<39-14,ROBERT>But -- but she was having second thoughts

794
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:50,130
<39-14,ROBERT>毕竟她看到科尔要因她的谋杀案被定罪
<39-14,ROBERT>about seeing Cole convicted for her murder.

795
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,940
<39-14,ROBERT>她想自首
<39-14,ROBERT>And she was thinking about coming forward.

796
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:54,410
<39-15,BECKETT>那会毁了你  所以你就杀了她
<39-15,BECKETT>And that would have ruined you, which is why you killed her?

797
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:56,550
<39-16,ROBERT>不不  我做的一切都是帮伊娃
<39-16,ROBERT>No, no, no, no. All I did was help Eva.

798
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:58,090
<39-16,ROBERT>她被杀跟我无关
<39-16,ROBERT>I-I had nothing to do with her murder.

799
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,660
<39-16,ROBERT>詹姆斯先生
<39-16,ROBERT>Yeah, mr. James,

800
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:03,240
<39-17,BECKETT>你上次见到伊娃是什么时候
<39-17,BECKETT>when was the last time that you actually saw Eva?

801
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:05,220
<39-18,ROBERT>在我们从树林里返回
<39-18,ROBERT>After we got back from the woods,

802
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:09,330
<39-18,ROBERT>我们清理了她家  然后我给了她
<39-18,ROBERT>we cleaned up her house, and then I gave her a key

803
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:11,540
<39-18,ROBERT>一把我们公司住所的钥匙
<39-18,ROBERT>to one of the company's corporate apartments,

804
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:12,800
<39-18,ROBERT>然后我就离开了
<39-18,ROBERT>And I left.

805
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:14,410
<39-19,BECKETT>公司住所
<39-19,BECKETT>Corporate apartment?

806
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:16,210
<39-20,ROBERT>她需要一个住的地方
<39-20,ROBERT>She needed a place to stay

807
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:17,650
<39-20,ROBERT>直到她能出国
<39-20,ROBERT>until she could get out of the country.

808
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,680
<40-1,BECKETT>罗伯特·詹姆斯在科尔被杀时
<40-1,BECKETT>So, Robert James was nowhere near Westchester

809
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,400
<40-1,BECKETT>根本不在韦斯切斯特附近
<40-1,BECKETT>at the time of Cole's death.

810
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,210
<40-2,ESPOSITO>那就排除了他是两件凶案凶手的嫌疑
<40-2,ESPOSITO>That pretty much rules him out for both murders.

811
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:26,780
<40-3,BECKETT>也意味着他说了实话
<40-3,BECKETT>Could also mean he was telling the truth,

812
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:29,060
<40-3,BECKETT>这个瞒天过海的点子不是伊娃想出的
<40-3,BECKETT>that it was someone other than Eva that planned the set up.

813
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:31,520
<40-4,RYAN>我想我知道是谁了
<40-4,RYAN>And I think I know who that is.

814
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,130
<40-4,RYAN>鉴证组检查了公司住所
<40-4,RYAN>CSU checked on that corporate apartment.

815
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:36,000
<40-4,RYAN>他们发现了伊娃的指纹  不过不止这些
<40-4,RYAN>They found Eva's fingerprints, but that's not all they found.

816
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,540
<41-1,AUBREY>我在为科尔的事宜善后
<41-1,AUBREY>I'm just putting Cole's affairs in order.

817
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:50,400
<41-1,AUBREY>很忙  你们需要什么吗
<41-1,AUBREY>I'm busy. Do you need something?

818
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,540
<41-2,BECKETT>哈斯金斯女士  我们得告诉你科尔·威特福德的
<41-2,BECKETT>Ms. Haskins, you should know that Cole Whitfield's blood work

819
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,920
<41-2,BECKETT>血检结果出来了  发现了高含量的镇定剂
<41-2,BECKETT>came in, showing high levels of sedatives.

820
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:59,210
<41-3,CASTLE>如此之高  他无法自行上吊
<41-3,CASTLE>So high, in fact, he wouldn't have been able to hang himself.

821
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:01,530
<41-4,BECKETT>我们重新核查了他的通话记录
<41-4,BECKETT>We re-checked his phone records

822
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:04,190
<41-4,BECKETT>注意到你给他家打过多次电话
<41-4,BECKETT>and noticed that you called his house on numerous occasions.

823
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,200
<41-5,AUBREY>当然打过
<41-5,AUBREY>Of course I did.

824
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:07,070
<41-5,AUBREY>我是科尔公司的总律师顾问
<41-5,AUBREY>I'm general counsel for Cole's company.

825
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:08,840
<41-6,BECKETT>是的  但大部分的来电都是在
<41-6,BECKETT>Yeah, but most of these phone calls came in

826
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,440
<41-6,BECKETT>科尔下班后打去的
<41-6,BECKETT>after Cole was already at work.

827
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,690
<41-7,AUBREY>伊娃也经常咨询我
<41-7,AUBREY>Eva consulted with me, as well.

828
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,720
<41-8,CASTLE>你就是在那时得知她要离婚
<41-8,CASTLE>That's how you found out her marriage was falling apart

829
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:17,330
<41-8,CASTLE>也知道她的婚前协议
<41-8,CASTLE>and about her prenup.

830
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:18,850
<41-8,CASTLE>于是你就不断示意她
<41-8,CASTLE>So you whispered in her ear,

831
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,330
<41-8,CASTLE>告诉她如何惩罚科尔
<41-8,CASTLE>told her how she could punish cole

832
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:24,540
<41-8,CASTLE>在这过程中还能拿走一笔钱
<41-8,CASTLE>and make a little walking-away money in the process.

833
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:28,380
<41-9,AUBREY>是吗  我干嘛要这么做
<41-9,AUBREY>Really? And why would I do that?

834
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,180
<41-10,BECKETT>我们得知科尔的第一任妻子
<41-10,BECKETT>You know, we were surprised to learn

835
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:32,560
<41-10,BECKETT>玛罗琳是你在大学的
<41-10,BECKETT>that Cole's first wife, Mallory,

836
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:35,430
<41-10,BECKETT>联谊会姐妹时  感到很惊讶
<41-10,BECKETT>was a sorority sister of yours in college,

837
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,930
<41-10,BECKETT>你因她的死伤痛不已
<41-10,BECKETT>And you were devastated by her death.

838
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:40,230
<41-11,AUBREY>我们都很痛心
<41-11,AUBREY>We all were.

839
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,100
<41-12,BECKETT>但是你告诉朋友们
<41-12,BECKETT>Yeah, but you were the one that told friends

840
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:43,610
<41-12,BECKETT>他杀了她并逍遥法外
<41-12,BECKETT>that he got away with murder.

841
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,260
<41-12,BECKETT>为什么过了这么多年
<41-12,BECKETT>So, why, after all of these years,

842
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,980
<41-12,BECKETT>你甘愿离开顶级律所
<41-12,BECKETT>would you leave a top-level law firm

843
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,470
<41-12,BECKETT>加入科尔的公司呢
<41-12,BECKETT>to join cole's company?

844
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,940
<41-13,CASTLE>我有个推理
<41-13,CASTLE>Here's a theory.

845
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:54,430
<41-13,CASTLE>你接受这份工作
<41-13,CASTLE>You took the job

846
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:56,670
<41-13,CASTLE>是想潜入科尔的生活圈
<41-13,CASTLE>to insinuate yourself into cole's life,

847
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:58,350
<41-13,CASTLE>寻找合适的方法
<41-13,CASTLE>searching for the right way,

848
00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:00,780
<41-13,CASTLE>合适的时机  为玛罗琳报仇
<41-13,CASTLE>the right moment to get revenge for Mallory,

849
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,790
<41-13,CASTLE>你在伊娃身上看到了机会
<41-13,CASTLE>And you found it with Eva.

850
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,270
<41-14,AUBREY>太荒唐了
<41-14,AUBREY>That's absurd.

851
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:07,320
<41-15,BECKETT>是吗  伊娃用公司住所
<41-15,BECKETT>Is it? Eva called your cellphone

852
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:09,440
<41-15,BECKETT>的座机给你打了电话
<41-15,BECKETT>from the the corporate-apartment landline

853
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,640
<41-15,BECKETT>那时她可"死掉"了
<41-15,BECKETT>after she was already supposedly dead.

854
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:13,260
<41-16,CASTLE>伊娃后悔了
<41-16,CASTLE>Eva got cold feet.

855
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:15,400
<41-16,CASTLE>她想自首  但你却不能允许她那么做
<41-16,CASTLE>She wanted to come forward, but you couldn't have that,

856
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,740
<41-16,CASTLE>毕竟你等了这么多年  谋划这么久
<41-16,CASTLE>not after all those years, after all that planning.

857
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:20,050
<41-16,CASTLE>于是你决定把伊娃的假死
<41-16,CASTLE>So you decided Eva's fake murder

858
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,830
<41-16,CASTLE>不得不变成真的谋杀
<41-16,CASTLE>would have to become a real one.

859
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:24,680
<41-16,CASTLE>杀掉科尔只是为了避免留下蛛丝马迹
<41-16,CASTLE>And killing Cole was just a way of tying up loose ends.

860
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,790
<41-17,AUBREY>很棒的故事  卡塞尔先生
<41-17,AUBREY>That's an exciting story, Mr. Castle.

861
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,830
<41-17,AUBREY>也许可以写成一本好书
<41-17,AUBREY>Maybe it will make a great book,

862
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:34,680
<41-17,AUBREY>但这些根本没法立案
<41-17,AUBREY>but it doesn't make for much of a case.

863
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,710
<41-18,BECKETT>我们拿到搜查令
<41-18,BECKETT>We got a warrant.

864
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:38,780
<41-18,BECKETT>我们在你的车后箱发现了伊娃的血迹和DNA
<41-18,BECKETT>We found Eva's blood and DNA in the trunk of your car.

865
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,400
<41-19,BECKETT>一切都结束了  哈斯金斯女士
<41-19,BECKETT>It's over, Ms. Haskins.

866
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:47,460
<41-20,AUBREY>我深表怀疑
<41-20,AUBREY>I doubt it.

867
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:53,670
<42-1,NEELY>接下来交给我们
<42-1,NEELY>Well, we'll take it from here.

868
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:55,340
<42-1,NEELY>再次感谢
<42-1,NEELY>Again, thanks for everything.

869
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:02,160
<42-2,BECKETT>她希望谋杀案凶手能被正法
<42-2,BECKETT>She wanted justice for one murder

870
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:03,820
<42-2,BECKETT>却犯下两起谋杀
<42-2,BECKETT>and ended up committing two of her own.

871
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:05,510
<42-3,CASTLE>有件事她说的很对
<42-3,CASTLE>Well, she was right about one thing.

872
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:08,330
<42-3,CASTLE>这故事的确很适合我写本书
<42-3,CASTLE>This does have all the makings for one of my novels.

873
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:10,470
<42-3,CASTLE>只是我不想写
<42-3,CASTLE>I just don't want to be the one to write it.

874
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:12,860
<42-4,BECKETT>走  回家
<42-4,BECKETT>Come on. Let's go home.

881
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:27,700
<43-3,RYAN>这样蛮公平
<43-3,RYAN>Yeah, that's only fair.

<43-4,ESPOSITO>很好  我有约
<43-4,ESPOSITO>Cool, 'cause I got a date.

<43-6,ESPOSITO>No, no. I wasn't feeling her.

885
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,480
<43-6,ESPOSITO>但是我登陆我的账户
<43-6,ESPOSITO>But I logged on to my account,

886

<43-6,ESPOSITO>发现一个不错的姑娘叫特雷克西
<43-6,ESPOSITO>I and found that there was this lovely girl named Trixie

891
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:49,370
<43-9,RYAN>我们拒绝了她的档案
<43-9,RYAN>We purposefully rejected her profile.

892
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,550
<43-9,RYAN>我们不想让她跟我们一起
<43-9,RYAN>We didn't want the possibility of her going

893
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:54,610
<43-9,RYAN>滑雪度假
<43-9,RYAN>on a weekend couples' ski retreat with us.

894
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:58,020
<43-10,ESPOSITO>算你倒霉
<43-10,ESPOSITO>Yeah, well, sucks for you...

895
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,790
<43-10,ESPOSITO>她会去的
<43-10,ESPOSITO>'cause she'll be there.

896
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:09,640
<44-1,BECKETT>敬结掉这案子
<44-1,BECKETT>Okay. To closing the case.

897
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,090
<44-2,BECKETT>你还好吗
<44-2,BECKETT>You doing okay?

898
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:20,740
<44-3,CASTLE>我被耍了  两个人被杀
<44-3,CASTLE>I got played and now two people are dead.

899
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:21,800
<44-4,BECKETT>那不是你的错
<44-4,BECKETT>That wasn't your fault.

900
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:24,050
<44-4,BECKETT>因为你  杀害二人的真凶被捕
<44-4,BECKETT>And because of you, two victims have justice.

901
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:25,870
<44-4,BECKETT>不过
<44-4,BECKETT>No, still...

902
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:28,830
<44-5,CASTLE>或许是因为当一个私家侦探
<44-5,CASTLE>Maybe being a private investigator,

903
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:32,530
<44-5,CASTLE>有太多的  我也不清楚
<44-5,CASTLE>there's too much -- I don't know --

904
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:35,510
<44-5,CASTLE>模棱两可
<44-5,CASTLE>Ambiguity.

905
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:36,780
<44-5,CASTLE>听着
<44-5,CASTLE>Look.

906
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:39,150
<44-6,BECKETT>你被这案子冲昏了头
<44-6,BECKETT>Y-you let the case get under your skin, you know?

907
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:40,230
<44-6,BECKETT>时有发生
<44-6,BECKETT>That happens.

908
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:42,240
<44-7,CASTLE>也许我不适合干这行
<44-7,CASTLE>Or maybe I'm just not cut out for this.

909
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,330
<44-8,BECKETT>你为了当私家侦探付出不少
<44-8,BECKETT>You know, you put a lot into becoming a P.I.

910
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:48,180
<44-8,BECKETT>别轻易下决定
<44-8,BECKETT>Don't make any hasty decisions.

911
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,650
<44-8,BECKETT>也许应该睡一觉再说
<44-8,BECKETT>Maybe you should just sleep on it.

912
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:54,450
<44-10,CASTLE>说得对
<44-10,CASTLE>You're probably right. I should sleep on it.

913
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:57,560
<44-10,CASTLE>或许小睡更棒一些
<44-10,CASTLE>Or perhaps I should nap on it.

914
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,230
<44-10,CASTLE>小睡很棒
<44-10,CASTLE>Naps are good.

915
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,500
<44-11,BECKETT>我强烈支持小睡
<44-11,BECKETT>I highly advocate naps.
