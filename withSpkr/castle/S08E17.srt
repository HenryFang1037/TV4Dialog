4
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:12,940
<1-1,LARS>这是你要的东西
<1-1,LARS>This is what you wanted.

7
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:20,690
<1-2,LARS>求你  放我走吧
<1-2,LARS>Now, please, let me go.

00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,070
<2-1,RICHARD CASTLE>哎呦
<2-1,RICHARD CASTLE>Whoops.

00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:31,780
<2-2,KATE BECKETT>等你清理干净了
<2-2,KATE BECKETT>You know, once you clean that up,

13
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:34,270
<2-2,KATE BECKETT>或许我们可以再...
<2-2,KATE BECKETT>maybe we could go for a, um, round...

00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:35,610
<2-2,KATE BECKETT>来个第三轮
<2-2,KATE BECKETT>three?

18
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,990
<2-3,CASTLE>你不用再跟我说一遍了  或许该说是"第三遍"
<2-3,CASTLE>You do not have to tell me twice, or should I say thrice?

19
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,130
<2-4,MARTHA RODGERS>早啊  亲爱的们
<2-4,MARTHA RODGERS>Good morning, my darlings!

<2-6,MARTHA>我不想打断你俩小情人
<2-6,MARTHA>Well, I don't want to risk interrupting you two love birds

22
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:53,430
<2-6,MARTHA>那个什么  但看来我还是打断了
<2-6,MARTHA>in the middle of you know what, and it looks like I have

23
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,350
<2-6,MARTHA>你俩那个什么
<2-6,MARTHA>interrupted you in the middle of you know...

24
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:57,710

<2-6,MARTHA>天呐  我不想多说什么  但是该用室温的
<2-6,MARTHA>My, my. Not judging, but room temperature.

<2-8,MARTHA>我希望我儿子能满足我一个小小请求
<2-8,MARTHA>I want for my son to grant me a very simple wish.

29
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:07,970
<2-8,MARTHA>我的出版商认为
<2-8,MARTHA>Now, it seems that my publisher says

30
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:10,390
<2-8,MARTHA>我的自助书如果想登上畅销榜
<2-8,MARTHA>that for my self-help book to make the best-seller list,

31
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,550
<2-8,MARTHA>我需要一位名人的背书
<2-8,MARTHA>I need a celebrity endorsement

32
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:14,420
<2-9,MARTHA>而且不是一般的名人
<2-9,MARTHA>and not just any celebrity endorsement --

33
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,820
<2-9,MARTHA>得是非同小可的背书
<2-9,MARTHA>the endorsement of endorsements.

<2-10,CASTLE>母亲  我乐意为你的书写点好评
<2-10,CASTLE>Mother, I would be happy to write something for your book.

<2-11,MARTHA>奥普拉
<2-11,MARTHA>Oprah.

36
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:21,850
<2-11,MARTHA>我需要奥普拉
<2-11,MARTHA>I need Oprah.

37

<2-12,BECKETT>Uh, do you even know Oprah?

38
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,520
<2-13,CASTLE>不啊
<2-13,CASTLE>No, I do not.

39
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,460
<2-14,MARTHA>你肯定认识认识奥普拉的人
<2-14,MARTHA>Well, you must know someone who knows Oprah, but --

40
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,310
<2-15,CASTLE>如果我保证去试试  你能离开吗
<2-15,CASTLE>If I promise to try, will you leave?

<2-16,MARTHA>'cause I have that same negligee,

44
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,290
<2-16,MARTHA>但上面有老虎爪印  这样的
<2-16,MARTHA>but, of course, it's in a little tiger print, so it's...

45
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,410
<2-16,MARTHA>继续做爱吧  亲爱的
<2-16,MARTHA>Well, resume your lovemaking, darling.

47
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,000
<2-17,BECKETT>莱恩和埃斯波遇到件凶杀案
<2-17,BECKETT>Hey, Ryan and Espo have caught a homicide.

48
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,530
<2-17,BECKETT>要一起去吗
<2-17,BECKETT>You want to join them?

49
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:49,960
<2-18,CASTLE>何必  这里就有犯罪现场
<2-18,CASTLE>Why? Got a crime scene right here.

50
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,720
<2-18,CASTLE>我母亲刚刚把性致干掉了
<2-18,CASTLE>My mother just killed the mood.

51
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,600
<3-1,KEVIN RYAN>好的  宝贝  我回头打给你
<3-1,KEVIN RYAN>Uh-huh. Yeah, okay, baby. I'll call you later.

52
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,740
<3-1,KEVIN RYAN>这里信号太差了
<3-1,KEVIN RYAN>Reception's terrible in here.

53
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:01,720
<3-2,CASTLE>起得早还是睡得晚
<3-2,CASTLE>Early morning or late night?

54
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,870
<3-2,CASTLE>都有
<3-2,CASTLE>Oh! Both.

55
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,230
<3-3,RYAN>珍妮睡不着  因此怀孕
<3-3,RYAN>Jenny can't sleep, which, in her crazy,

56
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,960
<3-3,RYAN>九个月的逻辑混乱的她认为  出于团结
<3-3,RYAN>nine-month-pregnant logic, means -- out of solidarity --

57
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:11,710
<3-3,RYAN>我也不能睡
<3-3,RYAN>I'm not allowed to sleep, either.

58
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:12,870
<3-4,CASTLE>还不算太糟
<3-4,CASTLE>Oh, well, could be worse.

59
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,480
<3-4,CASTLE>你不像被害人  被人置于
<3-4,CASTLE>You could be granted the eternal sleep

60
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,990
<3-4,CASTLE>永远的安睡中了  他叫什么
<3-4,CASTLE>like our victim, whose name is?

61
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:17,130
<3-5,JAVIER ESPOSITO>拉斯·克洛斯
<3-5,JAVIER ESPOSITO>Lars Cross.

62
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:20,280
<3-5,JAVIER ESPOSITO>一家石油勘探公司的声纳技师
<3-5,JAVIER ESPOSITO>He's a sonar technician for an oil exploration company.

63
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,380
<3-6,RYAN>嗯  切萨皮克能源公司
<3-6,RYAN>Yeah, Chesapeake Energy.

64
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:24,270
<3-6,RYAN>据说他原本在土耳其为他们工作
<3-6,RYAN>Apparently, he was doing an overseas job for them in Turkey,

65
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:26,440
<3-6,RYAN>但他因为严重矿工而被解雇
<3-6,RYAN>but he got fired for missing too much work.

66
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,570
<3-6,RYAN>从他的护照来看
<3-6,RYAN>According to his passport,

67
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:29,700
<3-6,RYAN>他三天前才回到美国
<3-6,RYAN>he only got back to the States three days ago.

68
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,690
<3-7,CASTLE>如果他刚被解雇  又怎么能买得起
<3-7,CASTLE>If he was just fired, how could he afford

69
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:33,450
<3-7,CASTLE>这么多酷炫的新玩具
<3-7,CASTLE>all those wonderful, new toys?

70
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:34,290
<3-7,CASTLE>那些不算什么
<3-7,CASTLE>That's nothing.

71
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:36,610
<3-8,ESPOSITO>他楼下还停了一辆崭新的保时捷911
<3-8,ESPOSITO>Got a brand-new Porsche 911 downstairs

72
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:38,330
<3-8,ESPOSITO>据说是现金支付的
<3-8,ESPOSITO>that he apparently paid cash for,

73
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:40,230
<3-8,ESPOSITO>而且他刚在沿街一家银行
<3-8,ESPOSITO>and he just leased a safe-deposit box

74
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:41,300
<3-8,ESPOSITO>租下了一个保险箱
<3-8,ESPOSITO>at a bank down the street.

75
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:44,350
<3-9,CASTLE>警探们  我推测  被害人
<3-9,CASTLE>Well, detectives, I deduce that our victim's

76
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:46,470
<3-9,CASTLE>突然的暴富是跟
<3-9,CASTLE>sudden influx of cash had something to do

77
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,220
<3-9,CASTLE>他...没有头
<3-9,CASTLE>with the fact that -- He has no head!

78
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,500
<3-9,CASTLE>哥们  说真的  不能提个醒吗
<3-9,CASTLE>Dudes, seriously, give a guy a heads up.

79
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,680
<3-10,LANIE PARISH>让开  卡塞尔
<3-10,LANIE PARISH>Make way, Castle! Oh!

80
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,430
<3-11,CASTLE>死亡时间  晚上10点到午夜之间
<3-11,CASTLE>Time of death -- between 10:00 p.m. and midnight.

81
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:59,850
<3-12,LANIE>拉斯被用胶带缠在了那把椅子上
<3-12,LANIE>Lars was strapped to that chair with duct tape.

82
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:02,110
<3-12,LANIE>死后瘀伤表明他先遭了折磨
<3-12,LANIE>Perimortem bruising indicates that he was tortured

83
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,980
<3-12,LANIE>才被凶手砍头  用的是
<3-12,LANIE>before the killer decapitated him with...

84
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:04,670
<3-13,ESPOSITO>刀
<3-13,ESPOSITO>Sword!

85
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,940
<3-14,CASTLE>土耳其弯刀
<3-14,CASTLE>A Turkish scimitar?!

86
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,460
<3-15,LANIE>我查了  没有指纹
<3-15,LANIE>Ah! I checked -- no fingerprints.

87
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,890
<3-15,LANIE>是被害人自己的
<3-15,LANIE>It's from the victim's collection.

88
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,240
<3-16,RYAN>看来  拉斯真的很喜欢中东文化
<3-16,RYAN>Apparently, Lars is really into the Middle East.

89
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,220
<3-17,CASTLE>那一带本就以可怕的砍头文明
<3-17,CASTLE>Oh, a region known for its sordid history of beheading.

90
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,530
<3-17,CASTLE>但是
<3-17,CASTLE>And yet...

91
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,950
<3-17,CASTLE>拉斯却是在曼哈顿被人砍头的
<3-17,CASTLE>Lars was beheaded here in Manhattan.

92
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:23,170
<3-17,CASTLE>或许拉斯错不该
<3-17,CASTLE>Perhaps Lars made the mistake

93
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,770
<3-17,CASTLE>把故事结局告诉了国王
<3-17,CASTLE>of telling the king the ending of the story.

94
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:25,590
<3-17,CASTLE>是吧
<3-17,CASTLE>Am I right?

95
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,940
<3-18,CASTLE>《一千零一夜》
<3-18,CASTLE>"1001 Arabian Nights."

96
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,260
<3-19,CASTLE>真是的  我好震惊
<3-19,CASTLE>Truly, I am shocked.

97
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,670
<3-19,CASTLE>你们怎么会都不知道
<3-19,CASTLE>How is it that none of you know the story

98
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:32,970
<3-19,CASTLE>《一千零一夜》
<3-19,CASTLE>of "1001 Arabian Nights"?

99
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:34,710
<3-20,LANIE>我们高中时不是死书呆
<3-20,LANIE>We weren't nerds in high school.

100
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,470
<3-21,CASTLE>好吧  你们走运  我现在开讲
<3-21,CASTLE>Fair enough. Lucky for you, class is now in session.

101
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,470
<3-21,CASTLE>在《一千零一夜》的故事中
<3-21,CASTLE>In the story "1001 Arabian Nights,"

102
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:42,820
<3-21,CASTLE>一位嫉妒心很强的国王每晚都要换个少女睡
<3-21,CASTLE>a jealous king would sleep with a new young maiden every night,

103
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,500
<3-21,CASTLE>然后就砍了她的头  这样别人就不能占有她了
<3-21,CASTLE>then have her beheaded so no other men could have her.

104
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,340
<3-22,LANIE>那么这是个关于厌女连环杀手的故事
<3-22,LANIE>So, it's a story about a misogynistic serial killer?

105
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,410
<3-23,CASTLE>不  是的  但不是
<3-23,CASTLE>No. Well, yes, but no.

106
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:52,270
<3-23,CASTLE>在故事中  为了制止杀戮
<3-23,CASTLE>In the story, to stop the bloodshed,

107
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:54,410
<3-23,CASTLE>一位名叫谢赫拉莎德的年轻少女
<3-23,CASTLE>a young maiden by the name of Scheherazade

108
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:56,690
<3-23,CASTLE>为国王编了一个引人入胜的故事
<3-23,CASTLE>wove a fascinating tale for the king,

109
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:58,260
<3-23,CASTLE>但她却不肯把结局告诉他
<3-23,CASTLE>but she refused to tell him the ending,

110
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,360
<3-23,CASTLE>逼他留她的命到第二晚
<3-23,CASTLE>forcing him to keep her alive till the next night

111
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:01,610
<3-23,CASTLE>让她讲完故事
<3-23,CASTLE>so she could finish the story.

112
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:05,650
<3-23,CASTLE>她每晚都讲个新故事  讲了一千零一夜
<3-23,CASTLE>She told him a new story every night for 1001 nights

113
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,640
<3-23,CASTLE>最终  国王娶了她
<3-23,CASTLE>till finally, the king married her,

114
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:11,200
<3-23,CASTLE>这说明了一个人会讲故事有多重要
<3-23,CASTLE>which really says a lot about the power of a good storyteller.

115
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,080
<3-24,RYAN>但却完全不能说明被害人为什么被杀
<3-24,RYAN>Yet tells us nothing about why our victim was killed.

116
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,760
<3-25,CASTLE>是吗
<3-25,CASTLE>Or does it?

117
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,610
<3-25,CASTLE>被害人遭到折磨
<3-25,CASTLE>Our victim was tortured

118
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:18,070
<3-25,CASTLE>是因为凶手  就像国王  想要什么
<3-25,CASTLE>because like the killer, like the king, wanted something.

119
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,540
<3-26,RYAN>被害人的姐姐会去分局见我
<3-26,RYAN>Well, our victim's sister is meeting me in the precinct.

120
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,580
<3-26,RYAN>或许她能告诉我凶手想要什么
<3-26,RYAN>Maybe she can shed some light on what that thing was.

121
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:27,400
<3-27,ESPOSITO>我去申请搜查令检查拉斯的新保险箱
<3-27,ESPOSITO>I'll pull a warrant for Lars' new safe-deposit box,

122
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,750
<3-27,ESPOSITO>看是否有凶手要的东西的线索
<3-27,ESPOSITO>see if there's a clue as to what our killer was after.

123
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,150
<3-27,ESPOSITO>是奥普拉的助理
<3-27,ESPOSITO>This is Oprah's assistant.

124
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,720
<3-28,CASTLE>我得去接
<3-28,CASTLE>Um, I'll take this.

125
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,340
<3-28,CASTLE>你们...
<3-28,CASTLE>Uh, you guys...

126

<4-8,GENEVIEVE>It was Lars' ex-boyfriend, Mark.

147
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,060
<4-8,GENEVIEVE>昨晚9点左右  马克在使劲敲拉斯的门
<4-8,GENEVIEVE>Last night around 9:00, Mark was banging on Lars' door,

154
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,000
<4-9,CASTLE>我们刚刚说到
<4-9,CASTLE>All right, where were...

155
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,810
<4-9,CASTLE>哪了

00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,310
<4-10,CASTLE>她人呢
<4-10,CASTLE>Where'd she go?

157
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,520
<5-1,RYAN>克洛斯女士  你弟弟回国后
<5-1,RYAN>Ms. Cross, your brother appears to have come into

158
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,390
<5-1,RYAN>似乎一下拿到了很多钱
<5-1,RYAN>a great deal of money upon his return to the country,

159
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,130
<5-1,RYAN>但我们查过他的财务记录
<5-1,RYAN>but we checked his financials,

160
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:38,670
<5-1,RYAN>毫无记录表明钱的来源
<5-1,RYAN>and there's no record where it came from.

161
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,140
<5-1,RYAN>你知道吗
<5-1,RYAN>Do you have any idea?

162
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,200
<5-1,RYAN>不知道
<5-1,RYAN>None.

163
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,350
<5-2,RYAN>我知道他去土耳其时身无分文
<5-2,RYAN>I know for a fact he was broke when he left for Turkey.

164
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,510
<5-2,RYAN>他在国内或国外有什么敌人吗
<5-2,RYAN>Did he have any enemies at home or abroad?

165
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,310
<5-2,RYAN>没有
<5-2,RYAN>No.

166
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,640
<5-3,ESPOSITO>他跟大家都处得很好
<5-3,ESPOSITO>He got along with everyone.

167
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,770
<5-3,ESPOSITO>包括他前男友  马克吗
<5-3,ESPOSITO>Ever his ex-boyfriend, Mark?

168
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:53,050
<5-3,ESPOSITO>据卡塞尔说  一位邻居听到
<5-3,ESPOSITO>According to Castle, a neighbor overheard

169
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:55,800
<5-3,ESPOSITO>拉斯的前任昨晚在他公寓外大吼
<5-3,ESPOSITO>Lars' ex yelling outside of his apartment last night.

170
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,550
<5-3,ESPOSITO>你弟弟欠他钱吗
<5-3,ESPOSITO>Did your brother owe him money?

171
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:01,980
<5-3,ESPOSITO>是马克替拉斯支付了一些哥大的学费
<5-3,ESPOSITO>Mark helped pay for Lars' tuition at Columbia.

172
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,670
<5-4,ESPOSITO>拉斯没还钱  是吧
<5-4,ESPOSITO>Lars never paid him back, did he?

173
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,270
<5-4,ESPOSITO>是啊  他们分手了
<5-4,ESPOSITO>No. They broke up.

174
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,110
<5-4,ESPOSITO>事实上  他接受去土耳其的工作主要
<5-4,ESPOSITO>In fact, getting away from Mark was the main reason

175
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:09,340
<5-4,ESPOSITO>就是为了离开马克
<5-4,ESPOSITO>he took that job in Turkey.

176
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,680
<6-1,RYAN>马克  你跟拉斯以前是一对儿
<6-1,RYAN>So, Mark, you used to date Lars.

177
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:15,660
<6-1,RYAN>据这些报告显示
<6-1,RYAN>Well, according to these reports,

178
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,000
<6-1,RYAN>他这一年间
<6-1,RYAN>he called the cops on you

179
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,620
<6-1,RYAN>十多次报警告你
<6-1,RYAN>over a dozen times in the past year.

180
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,080
<6-2,MARK>我有时会太过冲动
<6-2,MARK>I sometimes get overly dramatic.

181
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:23,200
<6-3,RYAN>没办法
<6-3,RYAN>What can I do?

182
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,090
<6-4,MARK>我是双鱼嘛  但我放下拉斯了  向前看了
<6-4,MARK>I am a Pisces, but I am over Lars, and I moved on.

183
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:29,070
<6-5,BECKETT>据一名目击者说
<6-5,BECKETT>Not according to a witness

184
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:31,330
<6-5,BECKETT>你昨晚还威胁他来着
<6-5,BECKETT>who saw you threatening him last night.

185
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,690
<6-5,BECKETT>是啊
<6-5,BECKETT>Oh. Yes.

186
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:35,030
<6-6,MARK>我经常威胁他
<6-6,MARK>I threatened him -- a lot.

187
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:37,950
<6-6,MARK>我给了他两万交学费
<6-6,MARK>All right, I gave him 20 grand to get his degree,

188
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,190
<6-6,MARK>我得到了什么样的感谢呢
<6-6,MARK>and what thanks do I get?

189
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,410
<6-6,MARK>他甩了我  还出国了
<6-6,MARK>He dumps me and leaves the country.

190
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,950
<6-6,MARK>现在时隔两个月  他就回来了
<6-6,MARK>And now he's back two months later,

191
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:46,590
<6-6,MARK>还开着保时捷到处跑
<6-6,MARK>rolling around in a Porsche, so, yeah.

192
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,980
<6-7,BECKETT>所以我是有点气疯
<6-7,BECKETT>I went a little mental.

193
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:50,410
<6-7,BECKETT>是啊  如果"有点气疯"
<6-7,BECKETT>Sure, if by going "a little mental,"

194
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,750
<6-7,BECKETT>是指折磨并杀害你前任
<6-7,BECKETT>you mean torturing and killing your ex.

195
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:54,710
<6-7,BECKETT>什么
<6-7,BECKETT>What?

196
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,600
<6-8,MARK>拉斯死了吗
<6-8,MARK>Lars is -- is dead?!

197
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:58,430
<6-8,MARK>天呐
<6-8,MARK>Oh, my --

198
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:07,150
<6-8,MARK>你们以为是我干的
<6-8,MARK>Y-You think I did it?

199
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,070
<6-8,MARK>天呐
<6-8,MARK>Oh, G...

200
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,460
<6-9,MARK>拉斯是我的挚爱
<6-9,MARK>Lars was the love of my life.

201
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,310
<6-9,MARK>我绝对不会
<6-9,MARK>I-I could never just...

202
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:19,290
<6-9,MARK>听着  我离开时拉斯还活着
<6-9,MARK>Look, Lars was alive when I left him.

203
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:20,230
<6-9,MARK>我发誓
<6-9,MARK>I swear to you.

204
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:22,270
<6-10,RYAN>-那是几点  -9:30吧
<6-10,RYAN>- What time was that? - 9:30?

205
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,160
<6-11,MARK>我叫优步去了上城区
<6-11,MARK>I Ubered up town.

206
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,430
<6-11,MARK>在一家酒吧碰到了几个朋友
<6-11,MARK>I-I met some friends at a bar

207
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:27,510
<6-11,MARK>然后就借酒浇愁到凌晨2点
<6-11,MARK>and drank away my sorrows till 2:00 a.m.

208
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,240
<6-12,BECKETT>好吧  就算
<6-12,BECKETT>All right, let's just, uh, suppose

209
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,570
<6-12,BECKETT>你说的是真的
<6-12,BECKETT>that you are telling the truth.

210
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:32,900
<6-12,BECKETT>在拉斯家发生了什么
<6-12,BECKETT>What happened at Lars'?

211
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:36,220
<6-13,MARK>他让我进去了  为所有事都道了歉
<6-13,MARK>He let me in, apologized for everything,

212
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:39,080
<6-13,MARK>还说给他一天时间去取钱还我
<6-13,MARK>and said he just needed a day to get the cash to pay me b--

213
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:42,370
<7-1,BECKETT>天呐  他说的是实话吗
<7-1,BECKETT>Wait. He was telling the truth?

214
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,770
<6-14,BECKETT>什么实话
<6-14,BECKETT>The truth about what?

215
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:46,400
<6-15,MARK>他一副疑神疑鬼的样子
<6-15,MARK>He was acting all paranoid.

216
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,550
<6-15,MARK>他从土耳其偷运了什么东西回来
<6-15,MARK>He had smuggled something back from Turkey,

217
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,920
<6-15,MARK>他的搭档觉得他出卖了他
<6-15,MARK>and his partner thought he had double-crossed him.

218
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,220
<6-16,RYAN>等等  什么搭档
<6-16,RYAN>Whoa, whoa. Hold on. What partner?

219
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,490
<6-17,MARK>我不知道
<6-17,MARK>I don't know. I don't know.

220
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:55,430
<6-17,MARK>真的  我以为那都是他编的
<6-17,MARK>Honestly, I just thought he was making it all up

221
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:57,160
<6-17,MARK>是为了不还我钱
<6-17,MARK>so th-that he wouldn't have to pay me.

222
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,900
<6-18,RYAN>你肯定很生气吧
<6-18,RYAN>I bet that pissed you off, huh?

223
00:07:58,930 --> 00:07:59,680
<6-19,MARK>没有
<6-19,MARK>Well, no.

224
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:03,230
<6-19,MARK>是的  但我也没杀他啊
<6-19,MARK>I -- Well, yeah, I-it did, but I didn't kill him!

225
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:06,080
<6-19,MARK>我只是拿走了他的笔记本当抵押
<6-19,MARK>All right, I just took his laptop as collateral.

226
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,820
<6-20,MARK>他是因此被杀的吗
<6-20,MARK>Is that why he was killed?

227
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:11,400
<6-21,RYAN>我们需要你交出笔记本
<6-21,RYAN>We're gonna need that laptop.

228
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,520
<7-1,BECKETT>马克的不在场证明证实了  他说的是实话
<7-1,BECKETT>Mark's alibi checks out here. He was telling the truth.

229
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:16,260
<7-2,CASTLE>你觉得拉斯偷运了什么回来
<7-2,CASTLE>So, what do you think Lars was smuggling?

230
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,260
<7-3,BECKETT>他当时在土耳其
<7-3,BECKETT>Well, he was in Turkey,

231
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:20,190
<7-3,BECKETT>那里可是阿富汗的海洛因运输渠道
<7-3,BECKETT>which is the heroin pipeline from Afghanistan.

232
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,390
<7-4,CASTLE>不  不是毒品
<7-4,CASTLE>Hmm. No. Wasn't drugs.

233
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,020
<7-5,BECKETT>为什么
<7-5,BECKETT>Why not?

234
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:26,020
<7-6,CASTLE>因为拉斯是被人用土耳其弯刀砍了头
<7-6,CASTLE>Because Lars was beheaded by a scimitar.

235
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,740
<7-6,CASTLE>我体内的讲故事人
<7-6,CASTLE>Well, the storyteller inside me

236
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,710
<7-6,CASTLE>希望缘由能更
<7-6,CASTLE>craves an explanation for more --

237
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,170
<7-7,BECKETT>-扯淡  -对
<7-7,BECKETT>- Farfetched? - Yeah.

238
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:33,000
<7-8,CASTLE>海盗宝藏  冷聚变
<7-8,CASTLE>Pirate's booty? Cold fusion?

239
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:34,340
<7-9,BECKETT>-外星人尸体  -不
<7-9,BECKETT>- Alien cadavers? - No.

240
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:35,960
<7-10,CASTLE>那些理论都太荒唐了
<7-10,CASTLE>Those are all ridiculous theories.

241
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,670
<7-10,CASTLE>你说"外星人尸体"了吗
<7-10,CASTLE>Did you say "alien cadavers," though?

242
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:38,820
<7-10,CASTLE>我看过一部纪录片
<7-10,CASTLE>Because I saw a documentary once --

243
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,540
<7-11,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你问话的那个
<7-11,BECKETT>Hey, Castle, um, what was the name

244

<7-11,BECKETT>女人叫什么来着  拉斯的邻居
<7-11,BECKETT>of that woman that you interviewed -- Lars' neighbor?

245
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,220
<7-12,CASTLE>我没问到名字
<7-12,CASTLE>I didn't get her name.

246
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:46,700
<7-13,BECKETT>我的警员好像忘记把她的供词放进案卷里了
<7-13,BECKETT>I think my UNIs forgot to put her statement in this file.

247
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,920
<7-13,BECKETT>我大部分时间
<7-13,BECKETT>I swear, most of my time

248
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,730
<7-13,BECKETT>都花在检查别人的文件工作上了
<7-13,BECKETT>is spent checking people's paperwork.

249
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,870
<7-14,CASTLE>你是不是出手后悔了
<7-14,CASTLE>You're suffering from a little buyer's remorse.

00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,600
<7-14,CASTLE>是啊  这就是人生残忍的笑话
<7-14,CASTLE>Yeah, it's one of life's cruel jokes.

<7-14,CASTLE>你得偿所愿
<7-14,CASTLE>You get exactly what you wished for,

252
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:57,920
<7-14,CASTLE>却发现这根本不是你想要的
<7-14,CASTLE>only to find that it wasn't what you wanted at all.

253
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,860
<7-15,BECKETT>不  我喜欢做警监
<7-15,BECKETT>No, I love being a captain.

254
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,210
<7-15,BECKETT>只是我有时候觉得
<7-15,BECKETT>It's just, sometimes it feels like

255
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:03,530
<7-15,BECKETT>自己更像幼儿园老师
<7-15,BECKETT>I'm more of a kindergarten teacher.

<7-20,ESPOSITO>不  还是我先说吧
<7-20,ESPOSITO>No, I think I'll go first.

260
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,040
<7-20,ESPOSITO>我的突破比你的大
<7-20,ESPOSITO>Mine's bigger than yours.

261
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,900
<7-21,RYAN>想得美
<7-21,RYAN>You wish, pal.

<7-23,ESPOSITO>瞧  她就知道
<7-23,ESPOSITO>See, she knows.

266
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:18,350
<7-23,ESPOSITO>我打开了拉斯的保险箱
<7-23,ESPOSITO>So, I opened Lars' safe-deposit box

267
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,800
<7-23,ESPOSITO>里面有40万美元现金
<7-23,ESPOSITO>and found 400 G's in cash.

268
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,580
<7-23,ESPOSITO>肯定是毒品钱  看你怎么破
<7-23,ESPOSITO>Gots to be drug money. Beat that.

269
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:24,260
<7-24,RYAN>轻松  我从马克那里拿到了拉斯加密的电脑
<7-24,RYAN>Easy -- got Lars' encrypted laptop from Mark,

270
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,850
<7-24,RYAN>查明了他在偷运什么
<7-24,RYAN>found out what he was smuggling,

271
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:27,360
<7-24,RYAN>不是毒品
<7-24,RYAN>and it wasn't drugs.

272
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:29,950
<7-25,ESPOSITO>什么
<7-25,ESPOSITO>What?

273
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,770
<7-26,CASTLE>不  拉斯不是毒贩
<7-26,CASTLE>No. Lars wasn't a drug dealer.

274
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,430
<7-26,CASTLE>他是个盗墓者
<7-26,CASTLE>He was a tomb raider.

275
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,930
<7-26,CASTLE>莱恩  你能放大这里吗
<7-26,CASTLE>R-Ryan, can you zoom in on that, please?

276
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,620
<7-26,CASTLE>我见过这个标志
<7-26,CASTLE>I've seen that symbol.

277
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,560
<7-26,CASTLE>对  在拉斯公寓里
<7-26,CASTLE>Yes, uh at Lars' apartment.

278
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,100
<7-26,CASTLE>记得那些关于《一千零一夜》的书吗
<7-26,CASTLE>You remember there was all those books on "1001 Arabian Nights."

279
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:54,580
<7-26,CASTLE>我觉得那个标志
<7-26,CASTLE>I think that symbol...

280
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,970
<7-26,CASTLE>就在其中一本书上
<7-26,CASTLE>...was on one of the books.

281
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:58,950
<7-26,CASTLE>没错  就是这个
<7-26,CASTLE>Yes. Here it is.

283
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:04,100
<7-26,CASTLE>所罗门封印
<7-26,CASTLE>The Seal of Solomon.

284
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:06,600
<7-26,CASTLE>"所罗门据称蕴含
<7-26,CASTLE>"The Seal of Solomon was believed to be imbued

285
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,560
<7-26,CASTLE>神秘力量
<7-26,CASTLE>with mystical powers,

286
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,790
<7-26,CASTLE>包括将灯神封入灯中的能力
<7-26,CASTLE>including the ability to seal genies into lamps.

287
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,620
<7-26,CASTLE>在《阿拉丁和神灯》的故事中
<7-26,CASTLE>In the tale of 'Aladdin and the Magic Lamp,'

288
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:15,270
<7-26,CASTLE>阿拉丁在一个山洞中发现了一盏内有灯神的神灯
<7-26,CASTLE>Aladdin finds a lamp containing a genie in a cave.

289
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:17,000
<7-26,CASTLE>很多人认为这个洞
<7-26,CASTLE>Many people believe this cave

290
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,370
<7-26,CASTLE>正是所罗门王的陵寝
<7-26,CASTLE>was actually King Solomon's tomb,

291
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:19,770
<7-26,CASTLE>而它极有可能位于
<7-26,CASTLE>which is most likely located

292
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:21,540
<7-26,CASTLE>叙利亚和土耳其边境"
<7-26,CASTLE>near the border of Syria and Turkey."

293
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,680
<7-27,CASTLE>伙计们  知道这意味着什么吗
<7-27,CASTLE>You guys, you know what this means?

294
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,440
<7-28,BECKETT>别啊
<7-28,BECKETT>Oh, please, no.

295
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,220
<7-29,CASTLE>拜托  钱  保时捷
<7-29,CASTLE>Come on. The money, the Porsche.

296
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:34,110
<7-29,CASTLE>是拉斯许的愿望  他的愿望成真了
<7-29,CASTLE>Lars wished for them, and his wishes were granted...

297
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,170
<7-30,BECKETT>来了
<7-30,BECKETT>And here we go.

298
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,370
<7-31,CASTLE>灯神实现了他的愿望
<7-31,CASTLE>...by a genie!

299
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,420
<7-32,CASTLE>拉斯找到了阿拉丁神灯
<7-32,CASTLE>Lars found Aladdin's lamp!

309
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:56,730
<8-1,CASTLE>太好了  谢谢  戴安
<8-1,CASTLE>Perfect! Thank you, Diane.

311
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,450
<8-2,RYAN>-伙计们  -嗯
<8-2,RYAN>- Guys? - Yeah?

312
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:00,280
<8-3,CASTLE>看啊
<8-3,CASTLE>Look at this.

313
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,120
<8-3,CASTLE>拉斯公寓里这些关于《一千零一夜》的书
<8-3,CASTLE>These books from Lars' apartment on "1001 Arabian Nights,"

314
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,480
<8-3,CASTLE>上面都有手写笔记
<8-3,CASTLE>they all have handwritten notes in them.

315
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,130
<8-4,ESPOSITO>这个还画了地图
<8-4,ESPOSITO>This one has... maps drawn in it.

316
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,250
<8-5,RYAN>这本里夹着关于所罗门王墓葬地的理论
<8-5,RYAN>This one has his theories of where King Solomon is buried.

318
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:14,520
<8-6,CASTLE>这些书是他的调研
<8-6,CASTLE>These books were his research that he used

319
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,060
<8-6,CASTLE>再加上他作为声纳工程师的技术
<8-6,CASTLE>in conjunction with his skills as a sonar engineer

320
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,110
<8-6,CASTLE>加起来就找到了所罗门王的陵寝
<8-6,CASTLE>to unearth King Solomon's tomb...

321
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:20,180
<8-7,RYAN>是啊  这我们同意
<8-7,RYAN>Yeah, we're with you on that.

322
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,860
<8-8,CASTLE>于是他找到了内有灯神的神灯
<8-8,CASTLE>...and find the magical lamp with the genie in it.

323
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,090
<8-9,ESPOSITO>这里我们就不同意了  卡塞尔
<8-9,ESPOSITO>That's where you lose us, Castle.

324
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:24,900
<8-10,BECKETT>那盏灯唯一的神奇之处
<8-10,BECKETT>The only thing magical about that lamp

325
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,960
<8-10,BECKETT>在于私人收藏家会为其支付的
<8-10,BECKETT>is the millions of dollars that private collectors

326
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,080
<8-10,BECKETT>数百万美元
<8-10,BECKETT>are willing to pay for it.

327
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:28,600
<8-11,RYAN>得了  卡塞尔
<8-11,RYAN>Come on, Castle.

328
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,130
<8-11,RYAN>你不是真的相信灯神吧
<8-11,RYAN>you don't really believe in genies, do you?

329
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:33,650
<8-12,CASTLE>我相信  除非我听到拉斯得到那么多钱
<8-12,CASTLE>I believethat until I hear a more viable theory

330
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:34,810
<8-12,CASTLE>更合理的理论
<8-12,CASTLE>as to where Lars got all that money

331
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:36,700
<8-12,CASTLE>这就是我的最佳理论了
<8-12,CASTLE>that this is the best theory I've got.

332
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,860
<8-13,ESPOSITO>那么你的最佳解释是一个灯神
<8-13,ESPOSITO>So, a genie is your best explanation?

333
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:41,180
<8-14,BECKETT>而不是拉斯在土耳其卖掉了其中一个物件
<8-14,BECKETT>Not that Lars sold one of the items in Turkey

334
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,970
<8-14,BECKETT>然后又把剩余的再偷运回来
<8-14,BECKETT>before smuggling the rest back here?

335
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:45,260
<8-15,CASTLE>好吧  这个理论还挺不错
<8-15,CASTLE>Okay, it's a... pretty good theory.

336
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,720
<8-16,RYAN>或是拉斯背叛了搭档
<8-16,RYAN>Or that Lars double-crossed his partner,

337
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,110
<8-16,RYAN>现金大概就是这么来的
<8-16,RYAN>and that's probably where all the cash came from.

338
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,720
<8-17,CASTLE>好吧  这个理论也不错
<8-17,CASTLE>Fine. That's a good theory, too.

339
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:51,960
<8-18,BECKETT>不不  这很棒
<8-18,BECKETT>No, no, no. That's -- That's better than good.

340
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,970
<8-18,BECKETT>这解释了他为什么被折磨
<8-18,BECKETT>It explains why the killer tortured him.

341
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:56,390
<8-18,BECKETT>如果凶手是他的搭档  他肯定想
<8-18,BECKETT>If it was his partner, then he would've wanted

342
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:58,290
<8-18,BECKETT>知道剩下的古董去哪了
<8-18,BECKETT>to find out what happened to the antiquities.

343
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,570
<8-19,ESPOSITO>我们会去调查拉斯在土耳其期间的活动
<8-19,ESPOSITO>We'll look into Lars' time in Turkey,

344
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:03,250
<8-19,ESPOSITO>看能不能挖掘到他和搭档之间的联系
<8-19,ESPOSITO>see if we can dig up a connection to his partner.

345
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:04,010
<8-20,BECKETT>好
<8-20,BECKETT>Okay.

346
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:07,190
<8-21,RYAN>我赌是拍下那些照片的人
<8-21,RYAN>My money -- it's whoever took those pictures. Yeah.

347
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,050
<8-22,BECKETT>那是什么
<8-22,BECKETT>What do you got there?

348
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,440
<8-23,CASTLE>写这本书的女人  玛丽昂·贝克博士
<8-23,CASTLE>The woman who wrote this book, Dr. Marion Baker,

349
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:13,260
<8-23,CASTLE>她是一名中东文学教授
<8-23,CASTLE>she's a professor of Middle Eastern literature

350
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,460
<8-23,CASTLE>在哈德逊大学任教
<8-23,CASTLE>at Hudson University.

351
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:16,190
<8-23,CASTLE>我们该去找她谈
<8-23,CASTLE>We should go talk to her.

352
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:17,490
<8-23,CASTLE>对神灯有更多了解
<8-23,CASTLE>Knowing more about the lamp

353
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:19,150
<8-23,CASTLE>能帮我们查清拉斯为什么因此招来杀身之祸
<8-23,CASTLE>will help us figure out why Lars was killed for it.

354
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:21,410
<8-24,BECKETT>你就是想去了解灯神和许愿的事
<8-24,BECKETT>You just want to find out more about genies and wishes.

355
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:22,110
<8-25,CASTLE>是啊
<8-25,CASTLE>Well, yeah.

356
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,940
<8-26,BECKETT>去吧  去见贝克博士吧
<8-26,BECKETT>Fine, go ahead. Meet with Dr. Baker.

357
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,770
<8-26,BECKETT>或许她能让你认清现实
<8-26,BECKETT>Maybe she can talk some sense into you.

358
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:27,470
<8-27,CASTLE>你的愿望是我的命令
<8-27,CASTLE>Your wish is my command.

359
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,330
<8-28,CASTLE>化作烟
<8-28,CASTLE>Smoke!

360
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:30,610
<8-28,CASTLE>他消失了
<8-28,CASTLE>And he's gone.

361
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,070
<8-28,CASTLE>好吧  我真走了
<8-28,CASTLE>Okay, now I'm gone.

362
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,860
<8-28,CASTLE>天啊
<8-28,CASTLE>Oh...my...

363
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:42,230
<9-1,MARION>所罗门王的陵寝  真了不起
<9-1,MARION>King Solomon's tomb. Remarkable.

364
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:45,910
<9-1,MARION>这可能是这五十年来最了不起的发现了
<9-1,MARION>It's arguably the greatest discovery in the last 50 years.

365
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:49,910
<9-2,CASTLE>贝克博士  这是我需要你专长的地方了
<9-2,CASTLE>Now, this, Dr. Baker, is what I need your expertise with.

366
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:50,870
<9-3,MARION>好的
<9-3,MARION>Certainly.

367
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,860
<9-4,MARION>看那凹槽
<9-4,MARION>Oh, you see these grooves.

368
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,670
<9-4,MARION>这表明灯是用轮子轧制的
<9-4,MARION>They indicate it was a wheel-made lamp

369
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:59,800
<9-4,MARION>而不是铸造的  那是在40年代...
<9-4,MARION>versus the mold-based ones that became so popular in the '40s --

370
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,270
<9-5,CASTLE>引人入胜  博士  但能不能快进到
<9-5,CASTLE>Uh, fascinating, Doctor, but can you skip ahead

371
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:05,890
<9-5,CASTLE>所罗门王往里面封印了灯神的部分
<9-5,CASTLE>to the part where King Solomon seals a genie inside of it?

372
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:09,240
<9-6,MARION>是西德尼叫你这么做的吗
<9-6,MARION>Did Sidney put you up to this?

373
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:09,980
<9-7,ALEXIS CASTLE>西德尼是谁
<9-7,ALEXIS CASTLE>Who's Sidney?

374
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:11,630
<9-8,MARION>终身教授职位被我顶下去的二货
<9-8,MARION>The schmuck I beat out for tenure.

375
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,280
<9-9,CASTLE>贝克博士  我不认识西德尼
<9-9,CASTLE>Dr. Baker, I do not know Sidney.

376
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,380
<9-9,CASTLE>这不是玩笑  我很认真的
<9-9,CASTLE>This is not a joke. I am very serious.

377
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,590
<9-10,MARION>但你一副真相信灯神的样子
<9-10,MARION>But you're acting as if you believe in genies.

378
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,830
<9-11,ALEXIS>博士  这不是演戏
<9-11,ALEXIS>Doctor, it's not an act.

379
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:22,230
<9-12,MARION>阿拉丁神灯的故事不过是
<9-12,MARION>Well, the story of "Aladdin and the Magic Lamp"

380
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:24,190
<9-12,MARION>爱情隐喻而已
<9-12,MARION>is a romantic metaphor, nothing more.

381
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:26,710
<9-13,CASTLE>当然了  但如果  仅仅是如果
<9-13,CASTLE>Of course, but what if -- and I -- and I'm only saying

382
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:31,700
<9-13,CASTLE>如果灯神的故事是有现实依据的呢
<9-13,CASTLE>what if the legend of genies were based in fact?

383
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:35,110
<9-14,MARION>希望不会  灯神是很可怕的
<9-14,MARION>Well, I certainly hope it isn't. Genies are frightful creatures.

384
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:37,420
<9-15,CASTLE>你是说他们不是活泼的60年代主妇
<9-15,CASTLE>You're saying they're not cheery '60s housewives

385
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,050
<9-15,CASTLE>或是高唱卡通歌曲吗
<9-15,CASTLE>or singing blue cartoons?

386
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,140
<9-16,MARION>这么说吧
<9-16,MARION>I'll put it to you like this.

387
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:42,310
<9-16,MARION>在阿拉伯语中  灯神和"恶魔"
<9-16,MARION>In Arabic, they use the same word for "Demon"

388
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,490
<9-16,MARION>是同一个词
<9-16,MARION>as they do for "Genie."

389
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:46,290
<9-16,MARION>他们是危险  反复无常的骗子
<9-16,MARION>They're dangerous, capricious tricksters

390
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:48,680
<9-16,MARION>随着清风来去无踪
<9-16,MARION>who appear and disappear in gentle breezes

391
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,100
<9-16,MARION>要么化作烟尘来去
<9-16,MARION>or a whirlwind of dust.

392
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,690
<9-17,CASTLE>如果神灯主人的愿望
<9-17,CASTLE>Now, what if the master of the lamp is killed

393
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:53,910
<9-17,CASTLE>实现前就被杀了呢
<9-17,CASTLE>before the wishes are granted?

394
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:55,930
<9-18,MARION>那么没有主人的灯神
<9-18,MARION>Well, then the masterless genie

395
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:58,010
<9-18,MARION>会与神灯分开
<9-18,MARION>would be separated from its lamp.

396
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,280
<9-19,CASTLE>就像日本的浪人武士吗
<9-19,CASTLE>Like a Japanese ronin samurai?

397
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:03,080
<9-20,MARION>是啊  但灯神将
<9-20,MARION>Exactly, but the genie would be forced

398
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,920
<9-20,MARION>只能四处游荡  直到有新的主人摸灯
<9-20,MARION>to wander the earth until a new master rubs the lamp.

399
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,340
<9-21,CASTLE>再跟我说说  贝克博士
<9-21,CASTLE>Tell me more, Dr. Baker.

400
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:10,550
<9-22,MARION>好啊  仅需19.95美元
<9-22,MARION>Oh, sure -- for the low, low price of $19.95.

401
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,510
<9-22,MARION>去买我的书吧
<9-22,MARION>Buy my book.

402
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,410
<9-23,MARION>你的故事可不是免费讲的  卡塞尔先生
<9-23,MARION>You don't give your stories away for free, Mr. Castle,

403
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:16,480
<9-23,MARION>我也是
<9-23,MARION>and neither do I.

404
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:20,710
<9-23,MARION>好了  失陪  我还得去上课
<9-23,MARION>So, if, uh, you'll excuse me, I have a class to teach.

405
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,900
<9-24,CASTLE>-谢谢  -谢谢
<9-24,CASTLE>- Thank you. - Thank you.

406
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:28,850
<9-25,ALEXIS>老爸  你怎么想的
<9-25,ALEXIS>Dad, what are you thinking?

407
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:31,620
<9-25,ALEXIS>拉斯发现了灯
<9-25,ALEXIS>Lars found the lamp,

408
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,250
<9-26,CASTLE>显然  他摸了灯
<9-26,CASTLE>and, clearly, he rubbed it,

409
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,620
<9-26,CASTLE>这样他就是灯神的主人了  是吧
<9-26,CASTLE>but that makes him the genie's master, right?

410
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,750
<9-26,CASTLE>但如果之后都再没人摸过灯
<9-26,CASTLE>But if no one has rubbed the lamp since

411
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,240
<9-26,CASTLE>接着又被我找到了
<9-26,CASTLE>and I were to discover it...

412
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:43,190
<9-26,CASTLE>那我就是灯神的新主人了
<9-26,CASTLE>then that would make me the genie's new master.

413
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,290
<9-26,CASTLE>好吧
<9-26,CASTLE>Okay.

414
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,800
<9-27,ALEXIS>就算这都是真的
<9-27,ALEXIS>Let's just pretend that all this is real.

415
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,950
<9-27,ALEXIS>你知道如果拉斯是灯神的主人
<9-27,ALEXIS>You do realize that if Lars was the genie's master,

416
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:51,680
<9-27,ALEXIS>那么他的下场可不太好
<9-27,ALEXIS>it didn't work out so well for him in the end.

417
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,260
<9-28,CASTLE>你什么意思
<9-28,CASTLE>What are you saying?

418
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,570
<9-29,ALEXIS>许愿时要谨慎
<9-29,ALEXIS>Be careful what you wish for.

419
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,240
<9-29,ALEXIS>你的愿望或许会成真
<9-29,ALEXIS>It just might come true.

420
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:59,000
<9-29,ALEXIS>在这件事上  你可能会因此招来杀身之祸
<9-29,ALEXIS>And in this case, it might just get you killed.

421
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,370
<10-1,RYAN>我现在真希望有个灯神
<10-1,RYAN>I could really use a genie right now.

422
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:05,210
<10-1,RYAN>我会许愿我的孩子已经降生
<10-1,RYAN>I would wish that my kid was already born

423
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:07,020
<10-1,RYAN>每晚都能安然入睡
<10-1,RYAN>and sleeping through the night.

424
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:10,760
<10-2,ESPOSITO>哥们  你当爹后变得好无趣
<10-2,ESPOSITO>Bro, fatherhood has made you so damn boring.

425
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:11,810
<10-2,ESPOSITO>如果我可以许愿
<10-2,ESPOSITO>If I had a wish,

426
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:14,940
<10-2,ESPOSITO>我会许愿成为全世界最棒的综合格斗拳手
<10-2,ESPOSITO>I'd use it to become the top MMA fighter in the world

427
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:17,840
<10-2,ESPOSITO>每晚都能带一个不同的性感小妞回家
<10-2,ESPOSITO>and take home a different hot chick every single night.

428
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,310
<10-3,RYAN>我转念一想
<10-3,RYAN>Okay, now that I think about it...

429
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,190
<10-3,RYAN>我会许愿
<10-3,RYAN>I would wish...

430
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:23,090
<10-3,RYAN>我可以做个百老汇明星
<10-3,RYAN>that I could be a Broadway star.

431
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:27,440
<10-3,RYAN>在满场的观众面前扮演冉·阿让
<10-3,RYAN>Play Jean Valjean in front of sold-out crowds,

432
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,650
<10-3,RYAN>赢下一堆托尼奖
<10-3,RYAN>win a bunch of Tonys.

433
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,190
<10-4,ESPOSITO>你要许愿穿紧身衣
<10-4,ESPOSITO>You'd wish to wear tights

434
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,560
<10-4,ESPOSITO>唱歌为生吗
<10-4,ESPOSITO>and sing show tunes for a living?

435
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,440
<10-5,RYAN>你要许愿穿三角裤
<10-5,RYAN>You'd wish to wear Speedos

436
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,040
<10-5,RYAN>跟浑身大汗的男人摔跤为生吗
<10-5,RYAN>and grapple sweaty men for a living?

437
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,590
<10-6,ESPOSITO>每晚能换个性感小妞带回家
<10-6,ESPOSITO>And hook up with a different hot chick every night.

438
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:37,520
<10-6,ESPOSITO>-别忘了这部分  -知道我想许什么愿吗
<10-6,ESPOSITO>- Don't forget that part. - You know what I wish?

439
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,240
<10-7,BECKETT>我的警探
<10-7,BECKETT>That my detectives would

440
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,670
<10-7,BECKETT>能好好干活儿为生
<10-7,BECKETT>actually get some work done for a living.

441
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:41,460
<10-7,BECKETT>你们去梦想岛时
<10-7,BECKETT>While the two of you were on Fantasy Island,

442
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,700
<10-7,BECKETT>我找到了线索
<10-7,BECKETT>I found a lead.

443
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:45,380
<10-7,BECKETT>麦克·哈林
<10-7,BECKETT>Mike Harlin.

444
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,470
<10-7,BECKETT>切萨皮克能源公司的地表钻工
<10-7,BECKETT>He's a surface driller for Chesapeake Energy.

445
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:49,430
<10-7,BECKETT>跟拉斯原是同公司同事
<10-7,BECKETT>That is the same company that Lars worked for.

446
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:51,040
<10-7,BECKETT>他跟拉斯搭了同一班
<10-7,BECKETT>He was also on the same plane

447
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,190
<10-7,BECKETT>飞机从土耳其飞回纽约
<10-7,BECKETT>as Lars from Turkey to New York.

448
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,560
<10-8,ESPOSITO>他肯定是拉斯的搭档
<10-8,ESPOSITO>He's got to be Lars' partner.

449
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,770
<10-9,BECKETT>我定位了他的手机  已经断线了
<10-9,BECKETT>I pinged his cellphone. It's disconnected.

450
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:57,900
<10-10,ESPOSITO>他要跑
<10-10,ESPOSITO>He's making a run for it.

451
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,500
<10-11,RYAN>如果他靠折磨拉斯
<10-11,RYAN>And if he tortured the location

452
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,390
<10-11,RYAN>问出了古董的位置
<10-11,RYAN>of the antiquities out of Lars...

453
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:01,120
<10-12,BECKETT>那么他很可能
<10-12,BECKETT>Then there's a good chance

454
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,380
<10-12,BECKETT>要去拿走古董  并永远逃脱
<10-12,BECKETT>that he's gonna grab them and try to disappear for good.

455
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,290
<11-1,CASTLE>阿丽克西斯
<11-1,CASTLE>Alexis?

456
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:11,940
<11-2,CASTLE>你
<11-2,CASTLE>You.

457
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,310
<11-4,CASTLE>你闯进了我办公室
<11-4,CASTLE>You broke into my office?

458
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:15,650
<11-5,GENEVIEVE>不  是红发妞放我进来的
<11-5,GENEVIEVE>No, the redhead let me in.

459
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:16,950
<11-5,GENEVIEVE>叫我在里面等
<11-5,GENEVIEVE>Said I could wait inside.

460
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:19,350
<11-6,CASTLE>你翻了我的桌子
<11-6,CASTLE>You went through my desk.

461
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,590
<11-7,GENEVIEVE>找笔给你写字条
<11-7,GENEVIEVE>To look for a pen to write you a note.

462
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,990
<11-7,GENEVIEVE>你真的好不相信人啊
<11-7,GENEVIEVE>Wow, you are a very distrusting person.

463
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:26,190
<11-8,CASTLE>是啊  有人对我撒谎时我就会这样
<11-8,CASTLE>Yes, I get that way when I'm lied to.

464
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:27,280
<11-8,CASTLE>我不知道你是谁
<11-8,CASTLE>Now, I don't know who you are,

465
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,940
<11-8,CASTLE>但你绝对不是拉斯的邻居
<11-8,CASTLE>but you sure as hell are not Lars' neighbor.

466
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:29,710
<11-8,CASTLE>我要报警了
<11-8,CASTLE>I'm calling the police.

467
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:31,090
<11-9,GENEVIEVE>如果你报警  我就离开
<11-9,GENEVIEVE>If you do, I'm out that door.

468
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,600
<11-9,GENEVIEVE>你也无法知道我可以是多么厉害的同盟了
<11-9,GENEVIEVE>And you'll never know how powerful of an ally I can be.

469
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,630
<11-10,CASTLE>好  给你一分钟说服我  说吧
<11-10,CASTLE>All right, you got one minute to convince me. Go.

470
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,620
<11-11,GENEVIEVE>我叫琳赛·蒂里昂
<11-11,GENEVIEVE>My name is Lindsay Dillon.

471
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,420
<11-11,GENEVIEVE>我是名记者  在调查
<11-11,GENEVIEVE>I'm a journalist researching a story

472
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:42,830
<11-11,GENEVIEVE>古董掠夺的事
<11-11,GENEVIEVE>about looted antiquities.

473
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:44,320
<11-11,GENEVIEVE>土耳其一名线人透露
<11-11,GENEVIEVE>A source in Turkey hinted

474
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,790
<11-11,GENEVIEVE>拉斯可能找到了所罗门王的陵寝
<11-11,GENEVIEVE>that Lars may have discovered King Solomon's tomb,

475
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:48,360
<11-11,GENEVIEVE>所以我就决定盯着他
<11-11,GENEVIEVE>so I decided to keep tabs on him.

476
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,650
<11-11,GENEVIEVE>所以才听到了他跟前男友之间的争吵
<11-11,GENEVIEVE>That's when I overheard the fight he had with his ex-boyfriend.

477
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:52,760
<11-12,CASTLE>为什么不报警  为什么撒谎
<11-12,CASTLE>So, why not tell the police? Why lie?

478
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,470
<11-13,GENEVIEVE>因为如果有人死了
<11-13,GENEVIEVE>Because when you've got a dead body,

479
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,010
<11-13,GENEVIEVE>古董被盗的新闻

480
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:57,630
<11-13,GENEVIEVE>从没人在乎
<11-13,GENEVIEVE>turns from a back-page snoozer

481
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:59,650
<11-13,GENEVIEVE>转眼就变成了头版头条
<11-13,GENEVIEVE>to a front-page lead just like that.

<11-15,GENEVIEVE>瞧  我就知道你能理解
<11-15,GENEVIEVE>See? I knew you'd get it.

488
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:11,790

<11-16,CASTLE>That doesn't explain why you broke into my office un...

<12-10,MIKE>我就知道她会让你们找到我
<12-10,MIKE>I knew she'd lead you to me.

525
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,480
<12-11,RYAN>谁  你指谁
<12-11,RYAN>Who? What are you talking about?

526
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:38,310
<12-12,MIKE>灯神啊
<12-12,MIKE>The genie, man!

527
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:40,460
<12-12,MIKE>她想要我的命
<12-12,MIKE>She's out to get me.

528
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:44,640
<13-1,MIKE>灯神是邪恶的
<13-1,MIKE>Genies are evil.

529
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:47,750
<13-1,MIKE>他们的愿望只能带来痛苦
<13-1,MIKE>And their wishes bring about nothing but misery.

530
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,420
<13-2,CASTLE>我明白是怎么回事了
<13-2,CASTLE>I see what's happening here.

531
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:57,060
<13-2,CASTLE>那个浪人灯神生哈林的气
<13-2,CASTLE>The, uh, wandering ronin genie is angry with Harlin

532
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,080
<13-2,CASTLE>因为他杀了其主人
<13-2,CASTLE>for killing her master.

533
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,740
<13-2,CASTLE>所以她不让他找到神灯
<13-2,CASTLE>That's why she prevented him from finding the lamp.

534
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,930
<13-3,BECKETT>卡塞尔  此人要么是有妄想
<13-3,BECKETT>Yeah, Castle, the man is either delusional

535
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:03,300
<13-3,BECKETT>要么是在为荒唐的
<13-3,BECKETT>or he's laying the groundwork

536
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,400
<13-3,BECKETT>精神失常辩护打基础
<13-3,BECKETT>for some B.S. insanity plea.

537
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,630
<13-3,BECKETT>你是怎么回事
<13-3,BECKETT>What's your excuse?

00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,460
<14-1,ESPOSITO>我们来谈一下拉斯吧
<14-1,ESPOSITO>Let's talk about Lars

539
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,780
<14-1,ESPOSITO>还有你是怎么用刀砍掉他的头的
<14-1,ESPOSITO>and how you chopped his head off with a sword.

540
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,510
<14-2,MIKE>不不不  我可没杀他
<14-2,MIKE>No, no, no, no, no. I didn't kill him.

541
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,310
<14-2,MIKE>好吧  他被杀的时候
<14-2,MIKE>Okay, I was at my mom's birthday party

542
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,330
<14-2,MIKE>我在参加我妈妈的生日派对
<14-2,MIKE>when he got murdered.

543
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:16,500
<14-2,MIKE>伙计  不信你去查
<14-2,MIKE>Man, check it out!

544
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:18,080
<14-2,MIKE>我敢肯定砍了拉斯头的那个人
<14-2,MIKE>I'm sure whoever took Lars' head off

545
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,280
<14-2,MIKE>马上就会来杀我了
<14-2,MIKE>is coming for mine next.

546
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,360
<14-3,RYAN>是吗  为什么
<14-3,RYAN>Really? Why is that?

547
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,530
<14-4,MIKE>我知道的太多了
<14-4,MIKE>I know too much.

548
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,480
<14-4,MIKE>我和拉斯  我们是在土耳其工作认识的
<14-4,MIKE>Me and Lars, we met on the job in Turkey.

549
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:25,940
<14-4,MIKE>好吧
<14-4,MIKE>Okay?

550
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:27,380
<14-4,MIKE>有一天
<14-4,MIKE>And then one day...

551
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:30,270
<14-4,MIKE>在进行完声呐搜索油槽后  拉斯过来找我
<14-4,MIKE>after a sonar search for oil pockets, Lars came to me.

552
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,180
<14-4,MIKE>他但是非常激动
<14-4,MIKE>He was all excited.

553
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,800
<14-5,RYAN>因为他发现了所罗门王的墓穴位置
<14-5,RYAN>Because he found the location of King Solomon's tomb,

554
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:35,240
<14-5,RYAN>然后你用你的挖掘本领
<14-5,RYAN>and you use your skills as an excavator

555
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:35,830
<14-5,RYAN>帮他把墓挖了出来
<14-5,RYAN>to help him dig it out.

556
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,200
<14-6,MIKE>不不  没那么简单
<14-6,MIKE>No, no, it wasn't that easy.

557
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,970
<14-6,MIKE>我们需要钱才能安全地完成这工作
<14-6,MIKE>We needed money to do it safely, okay?

558
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,270
<14-6,MIKE>所以拉斯去找了个人
<14-6,MIKE>So Lars, he found some guy.

559
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:45,090
<14-6,MIKE>他给我们每个人二十五万现金干这活
<14-6,MIKE>He offered us 250Ks each in cash to do the dig.

560
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,230
<15-1,MIKE>条件就是  如果我们找到了什么
<15-1,MIKE>The catch was, if we found something,

561
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,760
<15-1,MIKE>拉斯就要把东西运给这个人
<15-1,MIKE>well, Lars had to ship it to the guy

562
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,940
<15-1,MIKE>他在纽约
<15-1,MIKE>who's here in New York.

563
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,560
<15-1,MIKE>那这个金主是谁
<15-1,MIKE>Okay, so, who is this financier?

564
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,460
<16-1,ESPOSITO>我不知道
<16-1,ESPOSITO>I don't know.

565
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,740
<16-2,MIKE>给钱那么多
<16-2,MIKE>Look, the money was too good,

566
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,090
<16-2,MIKE>所以我什么都没问
<16-2,MIKE>so I didn't ask any questions.

567
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:57,670
<16-2,MIKE>不过我也希望我问了  因为打开那墓穴
<16-2,MIKE>I-I-I wish I did, though, 'cause opening that tomb

568
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:59,540
<16-2,MIKE>是我们做过的最糟糕的事了
<16-2,MIKE>was the worst thing that had happened to us.

569
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:02,960
<16-2,MIKE>自从我们拿走那盏灯后
<16-2,MIKE>I mean the moment we took that lamp,

570
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,410
<16-2,MIKE>灯神就开始复仇了  伙计
<16-2,MIKE>that genie unleased its vengeance, man.

571
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,780
<16-3,ESPOSITO>你不是想让我们相信
<16-3,ESPOSITO>You can't honestly be trying to tell us

572
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:07,880
<16-3,ESPOSITO>你看到了一个灯神吧
<16-3,ESPOSITO>that you saw a genie.

573
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,640
<16-4,MIKE>不  但是灯神可以选择
<16-4,MIKE>No, but genies can choose to appear

574
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,230
<16-4,MIKE>让谁看到或者不让谁看到
<16-4,MIKE>or not to appear to anyone they want.

575
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:12,140
<16-4,MIKE>真的
<16-4,MIKE>That's true.

576
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,610
<16-4,MIKE>贝克教授就是这么跟我说的
<16-4,MIKE>Professor Baker told me that,

577
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:15,430
<17-1,CASTLE>而且她是个博士  所以
<17-1,CASTLE>and she's a doctor, so...

578
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:19,140
<17-1,CASTLE>二位  以前我也不相信有灯神  好吧
<17-1,CASTLE>Look, guys, I didn't believe in genies, either, okay?

579
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:20,920
<18-1,MIKE>直到我的生活崩溃之后
<18-1,MIKE>Until my life fell apart.

580
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,790
<18-1,MIKE>我的女朋友跟我的室友上床了
<18-1,MIKE>I found my girlfriend in bed with my roommate,

581

<18-1,MIKE>然后我就跟我妈妈住到了一起
<18-1,MIKE>and then I stayed with my mom,

582
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,430
<18-1,MIKE>可我妈妈不小心扔掉了我的背包
<18-1,MIKE>and my mom accidentally threw out the duffel bag

583

00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:50,040
<18-4,MIKE>没有  拉斯没有坑我
<18-4,MIKE>No, Lars did not double-cross me.

596
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,480
<18-4,MIKE>他是被运货的人坑了
<18-4,MIKE>He got double-crossed by the shipper.

597
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,620
<18-4,MIKE>准确来说  是走私贩
<18-4,MIKE>Okay, well, really, the smuggler.

598
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:55,780
<18-4,MIKE>你不可能拿着价值连城的文物过海关
<18-4,MIKE>You can't just walk past customs with priceless relics

599
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,200
<18-4,MIKE>同时又不引起别人的怀疑  对吧
<18-4,MIKE>and expect no one to notice, right?

600
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,280
<18-5,RYAN>所以  拉斯在土耳其雇了一个人
<18-5,RYAN>So, Lars hired a guy back in Turkey

601
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:00,420
<18-5,RYAN>把东西运回来吗
<18-5,RYAN>to ship the items back?

602
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:02,260
<18-5,RYAN>-他叫什么名字  -我不知道
<18-5,RYAN>- What was his name? - I don't know.

603
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,640
<18-6,MIKE>但我知道  等等
<18-6,MIKE>I do know. Hold on.

604
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,040
<18-6,MIKE>但我  我知道
<18-6,MIKE>I do -- I do know

605
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,140
<18-6,MIKE>他骗了那个送货的人  好吧
<18-6,MIKE>that he lied to the shipper, okay?

606
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,050
<18-6,MIKE>他跟他说只是些开采设备
<18-6,MIKE>He told him it was just mining equipment.

607
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,340
<18-6,MIKE>可不走运的是  他的一个手下
<18-6,MIKE>The only thing was that one from his crew

608
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,150
<18-6,MIKE>撬开了箱子  发现了里面的文物
<18-6,MIKE>jimmied the crate and, found the artifacts.

609
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:15,370
<18-7,RYAN>我猜一下  送货的人提高价码了
<18-7,RYAN>Let me guess. The shipper started seeing dollar signs?

610
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:17,790
<18-8,MIKE>是的  他要四十万  还是现金
<18-8,MIKE>Yeah, and then he demanded 400 grand -- in cash

611
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:19,040
<18-8,MIKE>才会发货
<18-8,MIKE>just to release the shipment.

612
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,930
<18-9,ESPOSITO>这就解释了我们在拉斯保险箱里
<18-9,ESPOSITO>That explains the cash that we found

613
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:22,520
<18-9,ESPOSITO>发现的那些钱
<18-9,ESPOSITO>in Lars' safe-deposit box.

614
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,450
<18-10,RYAN>是的  可是拉斯是怎么弄到
<18-10,RYAN>Right, but how the hell did Lars get his hands on

615
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,670
<18-10,RYAN>四十万块钱的呢
<18-10,RYAN>400,000 bucks?

616
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:28,290
<19-1,BECKETT>别  别说是他许愿得到的
<19-1,BECKETT>Uh, don't -- don't say that he wished for it.

617
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,840
<19-1,BECKETT>他可能是从金主那拿到的
<19-1,BECKETT>He probably got the money from the financier.

618
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,940
<19-1,BECKETT>可是有一件事说不通
<19-1,BECKETT>But -- but the one thing that doesn't make sense is,

619
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,960
<19-1,BECKETT>如果拉斯已经拿到了这笔钱
<19-1,BECKETT>if Lars already had the extortion money,

620
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,440
<19-1,BECKETT>那为什么送货的人还要杀了他呢
<19-1,BECKETT>then why did the shipper kill him?

621
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,440
<19-1,BECKETT>别说
<19-1,BECKETT>Uh, don't --

622
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,820
<19-2,BECKETT>别说这是想掌控灯神
<19-2,BECKETT>do not say that it was to gain control of the genie.

623
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:40,840
<19-3,CASTLE>我没打算那么说
<19-3,CASTLE>I wasn't gonna.

624
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,590
<19-3,CASTLE>好吧  我是想这么说
<19-3,CASTLE>Okay, I was.

625
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:45,980
<19-3,CASTLE>不过还有另一种可能
<19-3,CASTLE>But there is another possibility.

626
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,710
<19-3,CASTLE>可能送货的人自己把宝藏留下了
<19-3,CASTLE>Maybe the shipper kept the treasure for himself.

627
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:50,400
<19-4,BECKETT>那为什么要折磨拉斯呢
<19-4,BECKETT>Well, then why torture Lars?

628
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:53,400
<19-4,BECKETT>如果他已经拿到文物的话
<19-4,BECKETT>I mean, what information could he possibly want

629
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,140
<19-4,BECKETT>那他想要知道什么消息呢
<19-4,BECKETT>if he already had the artifacts?

630
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:58,480
<20-1,BECKETT>各位  查到金主是谁了吗
<20-1,BECKETT>Hey, guys, any leads on who the financier is?

631
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,880
<20-2,ESPOSITO>没有  雇拉斯和哈林盗墓的这个人
<20-2,ESPOSITO>No. Whoever paid for Lars' and Harlin's tomb raiding

632
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,220
<20-2,ESPOSITO>把踪迹隐藏得很好
<20-2,ESPOSITO>made sure to cover their tracks.

633
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:04,330
<20-3,RYAN>哈林的不在场证据证实了
<20-3,RYAN>Well, Harlin's alibi checked out.

634
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:06,450
<20-4,ESPOSITO>也就是说这位神秘的送货人
<20-4,ESPOSITO>Which means that this mystery shipper

635
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:07,600
<20-4,ESPOSITO>是我们的首要嫌疑人
<20-4,ESPOSITO>is our prime suspect.

636
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:08,850
<20-5,RYAN>如果他当时敲诈了拉斯
<20-5,RYAN>If he was extorting Lars,

637
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:10,170
<20-5,RYAN>那他就有很大的动机杀他
<20-5,RYAN>he'd have plenty of motive for murder.

638
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:11,370
<20-6,BECKETT>好吧  去海关那查一下
<20-6,BECKETT>Okay, check in with customs.

639
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:12,850
<20-6,BECKETT>把上周所有
<20-6,BECKETT>Let's get a list of all of the ships

640
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:15,050
<20-6,BECKETT>从土耳其来的船列一份名单
<20-6,BECKETT>that have come in from Turkey in the last week.

641
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:16,660
<20-6,BECKETT>如果我们能查到文物的下落
<20-6,BECKETT>If we can track down those antiquities,

642
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:17,620
<20-6,BECKETT>应该就能找到凶手了
<20-6,BECKETT>that should lead us to the killer.

643
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:32,250
<20-6,BECKETT>最新美剧下载
<20-6,BECKETT>www.ZiMuZu.tv

644
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:23,950
<21-1,BECKETT>你还好吗
<21-1,BECKETT>Hey, are you okay?

645
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,010
<21-2,CASTLE>不好  我一直再查
<21-2,CASTLE>No. I've been doing some digging

646
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:27,510
<21-2,CASTLE>那位神秘的金发女郎
<21-2,CASTLE>into that mystery blonde.

647
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:30,240
<21-3,BECKETT>你是说那个记者
<21-3,BECKETT>You mean the reporter?

648
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,060
<21-4,CASTLE>她既不是记者  也不是拉斯的邻居
<21-4,CASTLE>She is no more a reporter than she was Lars' neighbor.

656
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,340
<21-5,BECKETT>什么  她又骗了你一次
<21-5,BECKETT>What? She lied to you again?

664
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,270
<21-6,CASTLE>这才是真正的琳赛·蒂里昂
<21-6,CASTLE>This is the real Lindsay Dillon,

665
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:40,100
<21-6,CASTLE>住在塔拉哈西的65岁黑人老太太
<21-6,CASTLE>a 65-year-old black woman living in Tallahassee.

666
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,820
<21-7,BECKETT>那这个金发女郎有啥企图
<21-7,BECKETT>Oh. So, what's this blonde's angle?

667
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:43,830
<21-8,CASTLE>我也想知道
<21-8,CASTLE>I wish I knew.

668
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,140
<21-8,CASTLE>她一边说谎
<21-8,CASTLE>She lies out of one side of her mouth,

669
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,870
<21-8,CASTLE>却一边又帮忙查案
<21-8,CASTLE>helps with the investigation out of the other.

670
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:49,340
<21-8,CASTLE>这说不通啊
<21-8,CASTLE>It just doesn't make any sense.

671
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,520
<21-9,BECKETT>就目前我们所知道的
<21-9,BECKETT>Well, I mean, for all we know,

672
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,910
<21-9,BECKETT>她可能是和凶手一伙的
<21-9,BECKETT>she could be working with the killer,

673
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:53,660
<21-9,BECKETT>想要误导我们的调查方向
<21-9,BECKETT>trying to steer us in the wrong direction.

674
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:56,210
<21-10,CASTLE>两次她都从我面前消失了
<21-10,CASTLE>Twice, she just vanished on me.

675
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:58,510
<21-10,CASTLE>都从我面前消失了
<21-10,CASTLE>Vanished on me.

676
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:00,480
<21-11,BECKETT>卡塞尔
<21-11,BECKETT>Castle?

677
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:05,260
<21-12,CASTLE>来去自如
<21-12,CASTLE>Appearing and disappearing at will,

678
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,380
<21-12,CASTLE>既骗我又帮我
<21-12,CASTLE>being both deceptive and helpful?

679
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,300
<21-12,CASTLE>那个神秘的金发女郎就是拉斯的灯神
<21-12,CASTLE>The mystery blonde is Lars' Ronin Genie,

680
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,160
<21-12,CASTLE>在地球上游荡  等待别人找到她的神灯
<21-12,CASTLE>wandering the earth, waiting for someone to find her lamp.

681
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,620
<21-12,CASTLE>她选择让我看见她
<21-12,CASTLE>She's chosen to appear to me.

682
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:15,750
<21-13,BECKETT>行了  别喝了
<21-13,BECKETT>That's it. I'm cutting you off.

683
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,680
<21-14,CASTLE>不  她已经给我线索了  贝克特
<21-14,CASTLE>No. She's -- She's given me clues, Beckett.

684
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,110
<21-14,CASTLE>她希望我找到神灯
<21-14,CASTLE>She wants me to find the lamp.

685
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,840
<21-14,CASTLE>我想她希望我成为她的新主人
<21-14,CASTLE>I think she wants me to be her new master.

686
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,960
<21-15,BECKETT>你觉得我怎么认为
<21-15,BECKETT>And you know what I think?

687
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:23,870
<21-15,BECKETT>下次你再看到她的时候得叫上我
<21-15,BECKETT>You need to call me the next time you see her

688
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:24,820
<21-15,BECKETT>这样我才能审问她
<21-15,BECKETT>so I can question her.

689
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,230
<21-16,CASTLE>我得去想一个愿望清单
<21-16,CASTLE>I got to come up with a wish list.

690
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:27,260
<21-16,CASTLE>天哪  我有好多愿望
<21-16,CASTLE>Oh, my God. I have so many!

691
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,630
<21-16,CASTLE>我怎么才能把它减少到三个呢
<21-16,CASTLE>How am I gonna whittle it down to three?!

692
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:29,750
<21-17,BECKETT>有意思  我只有一个愿望
<21-17,BECKETT>That's funny. I just have one.

693
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:30,680
<21-18,CASTLE>什么愿望
<21-18,CASTLE>What's that?

694
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,840
<21-19,BECKETT>我希望我的男人能不要再谈
<21-19,BECKETT>That my man would stop talking about

695
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,840
<21-19,BECKETT>成为某个金发女郎的主人
<21-19,BECKETT>being some skeezy blonde's master

696
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,690
<21-19,BECKETT>而开始考虑
<21-19,BECKETT>and would start talking about taking...

697
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:37,450
<21-19,BECKETT>和他的妻子去睡觉
<21-19,BECKETT>...his wife to bed.

698
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:38,600
<21-20,CASTLE>好啊
<21-20,CASTLE>Oh, well...

699
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:40,490
<21-20,CASTLE>我不需要灯神
<21-20,CASTLE>I don't need a genie...

700
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:42,150
<21-20,CASTLE>来实现这个愿望
<21-20,CASTLE>to grant that wish.

701
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,920
<22-1,ESPOSITO>嘿  头儿  我们复核了哈林说的
<22-1,ESPOSITO>Yo, hey, Cap, so, we cross-checked customs' records

702
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,860
<22-1,ESPOSITO>那天的海关记录
<22-1,ESPOSITO>with the date that Harlin said

703
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:52,050
<22-1,ESPOSITO>拉斯把古董装上船了
<22-1,ESPOSITO>Lars shipped the antiquities.

704
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:54,210
<22-2,RYAN>当天有一条船在伊斯坦布尔出港了
<22-2,RYAN>One ship left port that day in Istanbul,

705
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:56,400
<22-2,RYAN>而这条船在纽约卸下的唯一的货物
<22-2,RYAN>and the only cargo that it dropped off in New York

706
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,690
<22-2,RYAN>寄给了这个人  约瑞克·塞曾
<22-2,RYAN>was a shipment to this man, Yuruk Sezen.

707
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:01,680
<22-2,RYAN>他在苏豪区的一家店面里经营进口地毯的生意
<22-2,RYAN>He runs a rug-import business with a storefront in SoHo.

708
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,340
<22-3,BECKETT>很明显  他就是我们找的托运人
<22-3,BECKETT>So, obviously, he's our shipper.

709
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,040
<22-4,ESPOSITO>是啊  我们现在就去那儿
<22-4,ESPOSITO>Yeah, we're headed there now.

710
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,780
<22-4,ESPOSITO>希望那些古董还在他那儿
<22-4,ESPOSITO>Hopefully, he still has the antiquities.

711
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,570
<22-5,RYAN>包括  神灯
<22-5,RYAN>Including the, uh, magic lamp.

712
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,930
<22-6,BECKETT>伙计们
<22-6,BECKETT>Uh, guys, guys?

713
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:12,760
<22-6,BECKETT>如果你们找到了那盏灯而卡塞尔不在场
<22-6,BECKETT>If you find that lamp and Castle's not there,

714
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,300
<22-6,BECKETT>那我的耳根就别想清净了
<22-6,BECKETT>I'm never gonna hear the end of it.

715
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,590
<22-7,ESPOSITO>那我们叫他和我们在那汇合
<22-7,ESPOSITO>We'll have him meet us there.

716
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:17,520
<22-8,BECKETT>好  还有  你们能
<22-8,BECKETT>Okay, great. Ooh, can you just --

717
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,100
<22-8,BECKETT>你们能保证让他第一个擦那盏灯吗
<22-8,BECKETT>can you make sure that he gets dibs

718
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,470
<22-8,BECKETT>拜托了
<22-8,BECKETT>on the first rub, please?

719
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:23,710
<22-10,BECKETT>太好了  谢谢  我欠你们个人情
<22-10,BECKETT>Good. Thanks. I owe you.

720
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:28,290
<22-11,BECKETT>不敢相信我竟然说了那些话
<22-11,BECKETT>Can't believe I said that.

722
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,470
<23-1,RYAN>纽约警局
<23-1,RYAN>NYPD!

723
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:40,860
<23-2,ESPOSITO>纽约警局
<23-2,ESPOSITO>NYPD!

724
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,520
<23-3,RYAN>有人吗
<23-3,RYAN>Are you in here?!

725
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:54,190
<23-4,RYAN>安全
<23-4,RYAN>Clear.

726
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:55,110
<23-4,RYAN>我这里安全
<23-4,RYAN>I'm clear.

727
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:55,980
<23-4,RYAN>安全
<23-4,RYAN>Clear.

728
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,530
<23-7,RYAN>看样子约瑞克已经跑了
<23-7,RYAN>Looks like Yuruk skipped town.

729
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:00,350
<23-8,ESPOSITO>你在拿毯子做什么
<23-8,ESPOSITO>Why are you playing with the carpets?

730
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:03,150
<23-9,CASTLE>我在检查它们是不是魔毯  仔细想想吧
<23-9,CASTLE>I'm checking if they're magic. Think about it.

731
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:09,240
<23-10,CASTLE>伙计们
<23-10,CASTLE>Guys?

732
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,750
<23-10,CASTLE>这张毯子在流血
<23-10,CASTLE>This carpet's bleeding.

733
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:19,530
<23-11,RYAN>似曾相识啊
<23-11,RYAN>Deja-vu.

734
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,630
<24-1,ESPOSITO>看看这些瘀伤
<24-1,ESPOSITO>Check out these bruises,

735
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,720
<24-1,ESPOSITO>跟拉斯身上的一样
<24-1,ESPOSITO>just like Lars'.

736
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:29,940
<24-2,RYAN>胸上  腰上  脚踝上都有胶带
<24-2,RYAN>Duct tape on his chest, wrists, and ankles.

737
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,350
<24-2,RYAN>有人一定也把他绑起来了
<24-2,RYAN>Someone must have tied him up, too.

738
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,270
<24-3,CASTLE>所以除了彻底分离的头
<24-3,CASTLE>So, apart from the fully detached head,

739
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:35,850
<24-3,CASTLE>手法和拉斯一样  折磨然后杀死
<24-3,CASTLE>the M.O.'s identical to Lars -- tortured, then killed.

740
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:37,830
<24-4,RYAN>显然  约瑞克不是我们的凶手
<24-4,RYAN>Well, clearly, Yuruk's not our killer.

741
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:38,930
<24-5,CASTLE>真正的凶手一定是通过折磨拉斯
<24-5,CASTLE>Well, the true killer must have

742
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:41,360
<24-5,CASTLE>来找到约瑞克的
<24-5,CASTLE>tortured Lars to get to Yuruk.

743
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,010
<24-6,RYAN>然后折磨约瑞克来找到那些失窃的古董
<24-6,RYAN>Then tortured Yuruk to get to those stolen antiquities.

744
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:47,340
<24-7,ESPOSITO>尸体还是热的  凶手刚刚离开这里
<24-7,ESPOSITO>This body's still warm. The killer was just here.

745
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,290
<24-7,ESPOSITO>卡塞尔  去叫后援
<24-7,ESPOSITO>Castle, go call for backup.

746
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:49,710
<24-8,RYAN>-去前门等他们  - 好
<24-8,RYAN>- Wait for them out front. - Right.

747
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:54,940
<25-1,CASTLE>嘿  贝克特  对
<25-1,CASTLE>Hey, Beckett. Yeah.

748
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,760
<25-1,CASTLE>不  他们在在守着后门
<25-1,CASTLE>No, right now, they're securing the back.

749
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:59,130
<25-1,CASTLE>好的  我们会在的
<25-1,CASTLE>All right. We'll be here.

750
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:06,490
<25-2,CASTLE>灯神
<25-2,CASTLE>The genie.

751
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:08,290
<25-2,CASTLE>那是灯神
<25-2,CASTLE>It's the genie.

752
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,490
<25-3,CASTLE>我就知道是你
<25-3,CASTLE>I knew it was you!

753
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:24,080
<25-4,CASTLE>你  你不是我以为的那个人
<25-4,CASTLE>You -- You are not who I thought you were.

754
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:25,720
<25-4,CASTLE>抱歉  祝你今天愉快
<25-4,CASTLE>I'm so sorry. Have a lovely day.

<25-5,CASTLE>Ah, my back.

756

<25-6,PHOEBE>你得把那个还给我
<25-6,PHOEBE>I'm gonna need that back.

757
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,110
<25-7,CASTLE>当然  让我先掸一下土
<25-7,CASTLE>Sure. Let me just dust it off.

758
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:51,230
<25-8,PHOEBE>别碰
<25-8,PHOEBE>Uh, ah-ah, hands!

00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:56,550
<25-11,PHOEBE>-你在这做什么  -什么也不做
<25-11,PHOEBE>- What are you doing here? - Nothing.

762
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:58,690
<25-13,PHOEBE>你是个小人物在这什么也不做
<25-13,PHOEBE>So you're nobody doing nothing?

763
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,060
<25-14,CASTLE>很高兴认识你  我
<25-14,CASTLE>Pleased to meet you. I...

764
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:03,840
<25-14,CASTLE>很乐意跟你聊天  但你看上去很忙
<25-14,CASTLE>would love to chat, but, uh, you are obviously busy

765
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,580
<25-14,CASTLE>忙于某些合法的事情
<25-14,CASTLE>in whatever clearly legal endeavor you're engaged in.

766
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:08,580
<25-16,CASTLE>-你是警察吗  -不  不是警察
<25-16,CASTLE>- Are you a cop? - No, no, not a cop.

767
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,120
<25-17,PHOEBE>很好
<25-17,PHOEBE>Good.

768
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,590
<25-18,CASTLE>别  别  如果  如果我是个警察呢
<25-18,CASTLE>Whoa, whoa, whoa. What if -- What if I was a cop?

769
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:12,920
<25-19,PHOEBE>一样  我都要杀了你
<25-19,PHOEBE>Either way, I'm gonna kill you.

770
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:15,100
<25-20,CASTLE>你向我开枪  我就把这个摔了
<25-20,CASTLE>You shoot me, I drop this,

771
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,880
<25-20,CASTLE>它就会碎成很多块了
<25-20,CASTLE>and it breaks into a million pieces.

772
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,580
<25-21,PHOEBE>没关系  我还有一堆呢
<25-21,PHOEBE>It's okay. I've got a dozen more.

773
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:19,810
<25-22,CASTLE>但它们都有灯神吗
<25-22,CASTLE>But do they have a genie?

774
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:21,360
<25-23,PHOEBE>你多大了  五岁吗
<25-23,PHOEBE>What are you, 5 years old?

775
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:24,210
<25-23,PHOEBE>抱歉  老兄  我得做我该做的事了
<25-23,PHOEBE>I'm sorry, pal. I got to do what I got to do.

776
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:25,970
<25-24,CASTLE>我真的希望你不要做
<25-24,CASTLE>I really wish you wouldn't!

777
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,280
<25-25,CASTLE>你真是一个灯神
<25-25,CASTLE>You are a genie!

778
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,160
<25-26,GENEVIEVE>快跑
<25-26,GENEVIEVE>Come on.

779
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:45,170
<25-26,GENEVIEVE>我  神灯
<25-26,GENEVIEVE>I -- The lamp!

780
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:46,960
<25-27,CASTLE>-但是你的神灯  那是你的  -别管它了
<25-27,CASTLE>- But your lamp! It's yours! - Leave it!

781
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,270
<25-29,CASTLE>你就不能让我们坐在毯子上飞出去吗
<25-29,CASTLE>Couldn't you have just flown us out of there on a carpet?

782
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:09,350
<25-30,GENEVIEVE>你在说什么
<25-30,GENEVIEVE>What are you talking about?

783
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,320
<25-31,CASTLE>你不能让毯子飞吗
<25-31,CASTLE>You can't make carpets fly?

784
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,180
<25-32,GENEVIEVE>你能吗
<25-32,GENEVIEVE>Can you?

785
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,350
<25-33,CASTLE>我又不是灯神
<25-33,CASTLE>I'm not a genie.

786
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,200
<25-34,GENEVIEVE>我也不是
<25-34,GENEVIEVE>Neither am I.

787
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,260
<25-35,CASTLE>是啊  灯神会这么说
<25-35,CASTLE>Yeah, something a genie would say

788
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:15,880
<25-35,CASTLE>因为他们是骗子和无赖
<25-35,CASTLE>because they're liars and tricksters.

789
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,970
<25-36,GENEVIEVE>按你这么说
<25-36,GENEVIEVE>By that logic,

790
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,510
<25-36,GENEVIEVE>任何骗子都可能是灯神
<25-36,GENEVIEVE>any liar could be a genie.

791
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:21,720
<25-37,CASTLE>我们现在抓住你了  你哪儿也去不了了
<25-37,CASTLE>Well, we've caught you now, and you're not going anywhere.

792
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,130
<25-37,CASTLE>警察们就在那边
<25-37,CASTLE>The cops are right over there.

793
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,020
<25-37,CASTLE>所以你得告诉我们你知道的一切
<25-37,CASTLE>And you're gonna tell us everything you know.

794
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:27,810
<25-37,CASTLE>有没有搞错啊
<25-37,CASTLE>Come on!

795
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,130
<26-1,RYAN>等我们围住那个区域时
<26-1,RYAN>When we put the net over the neighborhood,

796
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:31,930
<26-1,RYAN>卡车和财宝都消失不见了
<26-1,RYAN>the truck and the treasure were gone,

797
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:34,420
<26-1,RYAN>因为你没能记下车牌号
<26-1,RYAN>and because you didn't get a license plate,

798
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,860
<26-1,RYAN>我们找到他们的希望很小
<26-1,RYAN>we have little chance of finding them.

799
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:37,350
<26-2,CASTLE>一切发生的太快了
<26-2,CASTLE>It all happened so fast.

800
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:39,620
<26-3,RYAN>噢  但你却有时间
<26-3,RYAN>Oh, right, and yet you did have time

801
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:42,380
<26-3,RYAN>偷偷靠近神灯  检查神灯
<26-3,RYAN>to "Creep over to the lamp, examine it,

802
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,420
<26-3,RYAN>拿着它面对枪口  擦神灯
<26-3,RYAN>get held at gunpoint, rub the lamp,

803
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:47,080
<26-3,RYAN>对着神灯许愿  让灯神在一阵烟雾里出现
<26-3,RYAN>make a wish upon the lamp, and have a genie appear

804
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:52,380
<26-3,RYAN>再用木板把女暴徒打晕
<26-3,RYAN>in a puff of smoke and knock the 'woman thug' over the head with a 2x4."

805
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:54,190
<26-4,CASTLE>你忘记说那里又黑尘土又多了
<26-4,CASTLE>You forgot the part where it was dark and super dusty.

806
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:54,880
<26-5,RYAN>卡塞尔  你很幸运
<26-5,RYAN>Castle, you're just lucky

807
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,330
<26-5,RYAN>蕾妮从约瑞克的尸体上提取到了DNA
<26-5,RYAN>that Lanie was able to pull DNA off Yuruk's body.

808
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,450
<26-6,CASTLE>她找到匹配了吗
<26-6,CASTLE>Did she manage to get a match?

809
00:29:58,450 --> 00:29:59,490
<26-7,RYAN>不  但是她能确定
<26-7,RYAN>No, but she was able

810
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:01,990
<26-7,RYAN>凶手是个女性
<26-7,RYAN>to determine that the killer was a female.

811
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:03,620
<26-8,CASTLE>很可能是那个拿枪指着我的女人
<26-8,CASTLE>Most likely the woman holding me at gunpoint.

812
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:05,760
<26-9,RYAN>或者是你那位神奇的金发灯神
<26-9,RYAN>Or your magical, blond genie.

813
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,760
<26-10,ESPOSITO>只有卡塞尔能看见的那位
<26-10,ESPOSITO>The one only Castle's seen.

814
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,040
<26-11,CASTLE>等等  你们俩都不相信我吗
<26-11,CASTLE>Wait a minute. So, neither of you believe me?

815
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,790
<26-12,ESPOSITO>不  哥们  我确实相信你
<26-12,ESPOSITO>Oh, no, bro, I-I do believe you.

816
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:13,820
<26-12,ESPOSITO>实际上根据你的描述
<26-12,ESPOSITO>I actually -- I was able to I.D. the genie

817
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:14,910
<26-12,ESPOSITO>我查到了那个灯神的身份
<26-12,ESPOSITO>based on your description.

818
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:15,810
<26-13,CASTLE>干得漂亮
<26-13,CASTLE>Good work.

819
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:24,600
<26-14,CASTLE>笑就笑吧  我还有两个愿望没许呢
<26-14,CASTLE>Laugh it up, you guys. I still have two wishes left.

820
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:26,390
<26-14,CASTLE>我不介意拿它们来干点坏事
<26-14,CASTLE>I'm not above using them for evil.

821
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:28,020
<26-16,CASTLE>-爸爸  -阿丽克西斯
<26-16,CASTLE>- Dad? - Ah, Alexis.

822
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:28,870
<26-16,CASTLE>很好  太棒了
<26-16,CASTLE>Good, great.

823
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:32,420
<26-16,CASTLE>快告诉他俩我相信灯神不是因为我疯了
<26-16,CASTLE>Tell these guys am I not crazy for believing in a genie.

824
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:35,190
<26-16,CASTLE>在你回答之前你要记住  有六个月的时间
<26-16,CASTLE>And before you answer, remember, I spent six months

825
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:37,290
<26-16,CASTLE>我都多做了一份午餐给你想象中的朋友
<26-16,CASTLE>making an extra lunch for your imaginary friend.

826
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:40,270
<26-18,ALEXIS>-真的吗  -那时我才七岁  但你也没疯
<26-18,ALEXIS>- Really? - Guys, I was 7, but you're not crazy.

827
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:41,840
<26-18,ALEXIS>那位神秘的金发女郎是真实存在的
<26-18,ALEXIS>The mystery blonde is real.

828
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,610
<26-19,CASTLE>太感谢你了
<26-19,CASTLE>Thank you!

829
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:44,080
<26-19,CASTLE>但她不是灯神
<26-19,CASTLE>But she's not a genie.

830
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:45,920
<26-20,ALEXIS>她的名字叫吉妮维芙·萨顿
<26-20,ALEXIS>Her name is Genevieve Sutton.

831
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,150
<26-20,ALEXIS>她在第二大道有一个服务处
<26-20,ALEXIS>She has an office on Second Avenue.

832
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:49,090
<26-20,ALEXIS>她被列为是个安全顾问
<26-20,ALEXIS>She's listed as a security consultant.

833
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:50,290
<26-21,RYAN>听起来像个清道夫
<26-21,RYAN>A fixer by the sound of it.

834
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:51,710
<26-22,ESPOSITO>你怎么找到这些信息的  阿丽克西斯
<26-22,ESPOSITO>Now, how did you get this info, Alexis?

835
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:54,020
<26-23,ALEXIS>我爸走之后  我在他桌子上找到了指纹
<26-23,ALEXIS>Well, after Dad left, I dusted his desk for prints.

836
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,140
<26-23,ALEXIS>让海莉帮了我点小忙
<26-23,ALEXIS>Got a little help from Hayley,

837
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:58,410
<26-23,ALEXIS>她在车管所的数据库了搜索了一下  看吧
<26-23,ALEXIS>who ran them through the DMV database, and voil?

838
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,350
<26-24,CASTLE>这么说她不是灯神
<26-24,CASTLE>So she's not a genie?

839
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,430
<26-25,ALEXIS>抱歉
<26-25,ALEXIS>Sorry.

841
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,960
<26-26,CASTLE>"吉妮"是吉妮维芙的简称吉妮
<26-26,CASTLE>Genevieve is short for "Genie."

842
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:07,410
<26-26,CASTLE>说真的  如果她能帮人实现愿望
<26-26,CASTLE>I-I mean, seriously, if she can grant wishes,

843
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:09,600
<26-26,CASTLE>弄一个驾驶证出来也很容易
<26-26,CASTLE>a-a-a driver's license, that would be a piece of cake.

844
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,250
<26-27,ALEXIS>但一个灯神怎么会这么做
<26-27,ALEXIS>but why would a genie want to do that?

845
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:12,410
<26-28,RYAN>说真的  谁在乎呀
<26-28,RYAN>Oh, seriously, who cares?

846
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:14,310
<26-29,ESPOSITO>卡塞尔的过家家结束了
<26-29,ESPOSITO>Make-believe time with Castle is over.

847
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:16,660
<26-30,RYAN>我们会把吉妮维芙带来  找出真相
<26-30,RYAN>We're gonna bring in Genevieve and find out the real story.

848
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,560
<26-32,ALEXIS>有人想吃冰淇淋吗
<26-32,ALEXIS>Someone need some ice cream?

849
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,120
<26-33,CASTLE>我
<26-33,CASTLE>Me.

850
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:30,220
<27-1,BECKETT>卡塞尔  什么...
<27-1,BECKETT>Castle, what --

851
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:33,280
<27-2,CASTLE>你也许把大家都骗过去了  但除了我
<27-2,CASTLE>You may have everyone else fooled, but not me.

852
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,400
<27-3,BECKETT>卡塞尔  让我进去
<27-3,BECKETT>Castle, let me in.

853
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,300
<27-4,CASTLE>我是你的主人
<27-4,CASTLE>I am your master.

854
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,500
<27-4,CASTLE>我命令你告诉我真相
<27-4,CASTLE>I command you to tell me the truth.

855
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:38,530
<27-6,CASTLE>-卡塞尔  -你到底是不是灯神
<27-6,CASTLE>- Castle! - Are you a genie or not?

856
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:39,400
<27-7,GENEVIEVE>你能让她进来吗
<27-7,GENEVIEVE>Can you let her in?

857
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:41,810
<27-7,GENEVIEVE>因为你把我搞得好毛骨悚然
<27-7,GENEVIEVE>Because you're seriously weirding me out.

858
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:43,300
<27-8,CASTLE>我就当你说的是有可能
<27-8,CASTLE>I'm gonna take that as a maybe.

859
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:46,600
<27-8,CASTLE>对不起
<27-8,CASTLE>I would apologize,

860
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,990
<27-9,BECKETT>但你用不着担心他的举动
<27-9,BECKETT>but his behavior is the least of your worries.

861
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:51,850
<27-9,BECKETT>你被指控犯有两起谋杀案
<27-9,BECKETT>You are accused of two homicides

862
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:54,350
<27-9,BECKETT>并与价值几百万的古董盗窃
<27-9,BECKETT>and connected to the theft and trafficking

863
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:57,010
<27-9,BECKETT>以及非法交易有关
<27-9,BECKETT>of millions of dollars in antiquities,

864
00:31:57,010 --> 00:31:59,020
<27-9,BECKETT>所以你最好的选择就是开口
<27-9,BECKETT>so your best bet is to start talking.

865
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,630
<27-10,GENEVIEVE>听着  我没有杀害任何人
<27-10,GENEVIEVE>Look, I didn't kill anyone, and I was trying

866
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:03,910
<27-10,GENEVIEVE>我在尽力不让那些文物落入恶人之手
<27-10,GENEVIEVE>to keep the relics from falling into the wrong hands.

867
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:06,460
<27-10,GENEVIEVE>我本来能成功的  要是我没有出手救你这位
<27-10,GENEVIEVE>And I would've, too, if I hadn't had to save your...

868
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,340
<27-10,GENEVIEVE>有现实障碍的丈夫的话
<27-10,GENEVIEVE>reality-challenged husband.

869
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:10,430
<27-11,CASTLE>我更喜欢幻想争辩这个词
<27-11,CASTLE>I prefer fantasy-augmented.

870
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,070
<27-12,BECKETT>你说的"恶人之手"是什么意思
<27-12,BECKETT>Uh, what do you mean by "Wrong hands"?

871
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:14,450
<27-13,GENEVIEVE>拉斯被雇去发掘那些古董
<27-13,GENEVIEVE>Lars was hired to excavate the antiquities

872
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:15,750
<27-13,GENEVIEVE>是为了保护它们
<27-13,GENEVIEVE>in order to protect them.

873
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:16,820
<27-14,BECKETT>被谁雇去
<27-14,BECKETT>Hired by who?

874
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:20,290
<27-15,GENEVIEVE>一位匿名捐助者  我们就称他X先生吧
<27-15,GENEVIEVE>An anonymous benefactor. Let's call him Mr. X.

875
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:23,340
<27-15,GENEVIEVE>叙利亚战争有波及土耳其的危险
<27-15,GENEVIEVE>With the Syrian conflict threatening to spill over into Turkey,

876
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:26,690
<27-15,GENEVIEVE>X先生很担心所罗门的墓会被破坏
<27-15,GENEVIEVE>Mr. X became concerned that Solomon's tomb would be destroyed

877
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:30,120
<27-15,GENEVIEVE>甚至被洗劫  文物被卖为恐怖活动提供资金
<27-15,GENEVIEVE>or worse, looted and the relics sold to fund terrorism.

878
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,400
<27-16,BECKETT>你是怎么知道这一切的
<27-16,BECKETT>And you know all of this how?

879
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,730
<27-17,GENEVIEVE>X先生找到了我的服务为了确保
<27-17,GENEVIEVE>Mr. X retained my services in order to ensure

880
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:38,020
<27-17,GENEVIEVE>拉斯能从约瑞克那追回这些文物
<27-17,GENEVIEVE>Lars recovered the artifacts from Yuruk.

881
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:40,040
<27-18,BECKETT>但拉斯却死了
<27-18,BECKETT>But instead, Lars ended up dead.

882
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,360
<27-19,GENEVIEVE>很不幸
<27-19,GENEVIEVE>Unfortunately.

883
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,870
<27-19,GENEVIEVE>拉斯被害那晚
<27-19,GENEVIEVE>The night that Lars was murdered,

884
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:44,880
<27-19,GENEVIEVE>我因为一条错误的线索被调离了
<27-19,GENEVIEVE>I was pulled away on a false lead.

885
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:47,760
<27-19,GENEVIEVE>当我回来时  到处都是警察
<27-19,GENEVIEVE>When I got back, the cops were everywhere.

886
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,590
<27-19,GENEVIEVE>所以我就盯上了卡塞尔先生
<27-19,GENEVIEVE>So I targeted Mr. Castle

887
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:51,560
<27-19,GENEVIEVE>想借助他了解警察都知道些什么
<27-19,GENEVIEVE>as a way to learn what the police knew.

888
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:54,510
<27-20,CASTLE>我想你并没有获得那辆卡车的牌照
<27-20,CASTLE>I don't suppose you got the license plate of that truck

889
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:56,930
<27-20,CASTLE>当你在救我的时候
<27-20,CASTLE>as you were...saving me?

890
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:57,970
<27-20,CASTLE>是没有
<27-20,CASTLE>No.

891
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,970
<27-21,GENEVIEVE>但我在救你之前就有了
<27-21,GENEVIEVE>But I did before I saved you.

892
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,420
<28-1,RYAN>州警察刚找到了那辆卡车
<28-1,RYAN>State police just found the truck.

893
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:06,700
<28-2,ESPOSITO>我们接入了拉伊外一个休息站的实时动态
<28-2,ESPOSITO>We're tapped into a live feed from a rest stop outside of Rye.

894
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,130
<28-1,RYAN>我们查到了那辆卡车
<28-1,RYAN>We've got eyes on the truck.

895
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:10,110
<28-2,ESPOSITO>证实有车上有人吗
<28-2,ESPOSITO>Do you have confirmation of passengers?

896

<28-2,ESPOSITO>Affirmative. Two passengers -- male and female,

<28-2,ESPOSITO>符合对嫌疑犯的描述
<28-2,ESPOSITO>fitting the descriptions of the suspects.

<28-3,RYAN>宝贝  对不起  现在真不是通电话的时候
<28-3,RYAN>Oh, hey, babe. Sorry, It's not really a good time right now.

<28-8,ESPOSITO>Hold on. Suspects are exiting the truck.

907
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,000
<28-8,ESPOSITO>我们要行动吗
<28-8,ESPOSITO>Do we have a green light?

908
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:37,880
<28-8,ESPOSITO>确定
<28-8,ESPOSITO>Affirmative.

909
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:40,670
<28-8,ESPOSITO>纽约警局  趴下  有枪
<28-8,ESPOSITO>NYPD! Get down! Guns, guns!

910
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:49,120
<28-8,ESPOSITO>警监  现在是什么情况
<28-8,ESPOSITO>Captain, what's your status?

911
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,600
<28-8,ESPOSITO>男性嫌疑人被击倒  医护人员正在抢救
<28-8,ESPOSITO>Male suspect is down. Medic is treating him now.

912
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:55,290
<26-1,RYAN>我们抓捕到女性嫌疑人
<26-1,RYAN>We have the female suspect in custody.

913
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:57,800
<28-10,DISPATCH>我是贝克特警监  车上有发现什么吗
<28-10,DISPATCH>This is Captain Beckett. Is there anything in that truck?

914
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:01,460
<28-11,BECKETT>有  有是十一个板条箱
<28-11,BECKETT>Affirmative. I count 11 crates.

915
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:04,380
<28-12,BECKETT>吉妮维芙说应该有十二个
<28-12,BECKETT>Genevieve said that there would be 12.

916
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:06,410
<28-13,ESPOSITO>我想我知道哪个箱子不在了
<28-13,ESPOSITO>I bet I know which crate is missing.

917
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,350
<29-1,CASTLE>那个灯在哪里  菲比
<29-1,CASTLE>Where's the lamp, Phoebe?

918
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,460
<29-2,ESPOSITO>在这你只有一个机会
<29-2,ESPOSITO>You've got one chance to help yourself here.

919
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:15,840
<29-2,ESPOSITO>我们知道你没有杀害约瑞克
<29-2,ESPOSITO>Now, we know you didn't kill Yuruk.

920
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:17,340
<29-2,ESPOSITO>交通监控显示当他被害时
<29-2,ESPOSITO>Traffic cams put you and the truck

921
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:19,510
<29-2,ESPOSITO>你还有那辆车在城市的另一边
<29-2,ESPOSITO>on the other side of the city when he was murdered.

922
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:22,250
<29-3,CASTLE>但你跟特维斯也逃不了成为雇佣同伙事实
<29-3,CASTLE>And that makes you and Travis little more than the hired help.

923
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:24,810
<29-4,ESPOSITO>为了你自己还是开口比较好
<29-4,ESPOSITO>So I'd do myself a favor and start talking,

924
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:27,680
<29-4,ESPOSITO>就从你把那盏灯送去给谁开始吧
<29-4,ESPOSITO>beginning with who you delivered the lamp to.

925
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:32,510
<29-5,PHOEBE>我也许是雇佣同伙  但我不是叛徒
<29-5,PHOEBE>I might be hired help, but I ain't no rat.

926
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,610
<29-5,PHOEBE>我需要律师
<29-5,PHOEBE>I want a lawyer.

927
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:37,850
<29-5,PHOEBE>我知道我的权利
<29-5,PHOEBE>I know my rights.

928
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,750
<29-6,ESPOSITO>DNA显示凶手是一名女性
<29-6,ESPOSITO>DNA confirms that our killer's a woman

929
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,210
<29-6,ESPOSITO>但肯定是一个有着资源还有关系的人
<29-6,ESPOSITO>but someone with resources and connections,

930
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:48,350
<29-6,ESPOSITO>不是这种小人
<29-6,ESPOSITO>not this flunky.

931
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:50,580
<29-7,CASTLE>一个认识拉斯的凶手  一个女人
<29-7,CASTLE>A killer who knew Lars, a woman who...

932
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:52,840
<29-7,CASTLE>会冒着失去整批货物的风险
<29-7,CASTLE>would risk losing the entire shipment

933
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,010
<29-7,CASTLE>就为了终极的战利品  那盏灯
<29-7,CASTLE>for the ultimate prize -- the lamp.

934
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:58,750
<29-7,CASTLE>我知道有个人能带我们找到真相
<29-7,CASTLE>And I know just the person to lead us to it.

935
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:03,150
<30-1,CASTLE>贝克博士  再次感谢你能来
<30-1,CASTLE>Dr. Baker, thank you again for coming to see us.

936
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,300
<30-2,MARION>当你告诉我你找到了阿拉丁的灯神
<30-2,MARION>Well, how could I resist

937
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:07,010
<30-2,MARION>我怎么能拒绝呢
<30-2,MARION>when you told me you found the genie from Aladdin's lamp?

938
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:09,340
<30-3,ESPOSITO>那是个小小的善意的谎言
<30-3,ESPOSITO>That was a little bit of a white lie.

939
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:11,140
<30-4,CASTLE>是这样  我们查看了一下
<30-4,CASTLE>Yeah, see, we were looking back

940
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:13,540
<30-4,CASTLE>拉斯在哥伦比亚的学校记录
<30-4,CASTLE>over Lars' school records from Columbia.

941
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:16,400
<30-4,CASTLE>发现他几年前在哈德逊大学
<30-4,CASTLE>It turns out he actually audited a class of yours

942
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,410
<30-4,CASTLE>旁听过一节你的课
<30-4,CASTLE>at Hudson University a few years back.

943
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:22,480
<30-5,MARION>我每年都有很多新生
<30-5,MARION>I have hundreds of students every year.

944
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,990
<30-5,MARION>没法记住所有人
<30-5,MARION>I'm afraid I can't remember all of them.

945
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:26,820
<30-6,CASTLE>那就奇怪了  你的助教记得你和拉斯
<30-6,CASTLE>That's strange. Your T.A. remembers that you and Lars

946
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,740
<30-6,CASTLE>在你上班时间会定期会面
<30-6,CASTLE>would meet regularly during your office hours.

947
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:31,030
<30-7,ESPOSITO>事实上  他说拉斯从土耳其回来的那天早上
<30-7,ESPOSITO>In fact, he said that you guys met the morning

948
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:32,490
<30-7,ESPOSITO>你们还见面了呢
<30-7,ESPOSITO>that Lars returned from Turkey.

949
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:34,290
<30-8,CASTLE>拉斯肯定也了解你对神灯的研究成果
<30-8,CASTLE>Now, Lars, I'm sure, shared the discovery of the lamp with you,

950
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:37,800
<30-8,CASTLE>他知道你比任何人都更能领会神灯的价值
<30-8,CASTLE>knowing that you of all people would appreciate its value,

951
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:41,610
<30-8,CASTLE>但他却万没料到你对他产生了职业嫉妒
<30-8,CASTLE>but what he wasn't counting on was your professional jealousy.

952
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,520
<30-9,MARION>我为什么要嫉妒
<30-9,MARION>Why on earth would I be jealous?

953
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,710
<30-10,CASTLE>你寻找所罗门国王的墓穴已经15年了
<30-10,CASTLE>You've been searching for King Solomon's tomb for over 15 years.

954
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,220
<30-10,CASTLE>我们和你的系主任谈过了
<30-10,CASTLE>We talked to the dean of your department.

955
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:50,160
<30-10,CASTLE>他告诉了我们你的痴迷
<30-10,CASTLE>He told us about your obsession.

956
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:52,600
<30-10,CASTLE>那份痴迷毁掉了你的婚姻  也近乎毁掉了你
<30-10,CASTLE>How it ruined your marriage and nearly destroyed you.

957
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,890
<30-11,MARION>那不是真的
<30-11,MARION>That is not true.

958
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:56,590
<30-12,ESPOSITO>因为你从未找到那座墓穴
<30-12,ESPOSITO>Because you never found that tomb.

959
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:59,650
<30-13,CASTLE>你肯定无法忍受
<30-13,CASTLE>Now, that must have been a bitter pill to swallow,

960
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:02,920
<30-13,CASTLE>拉斯用尽你呕心沥血所得的研究成果
<30-13,CASTLE>knowing that Lars used all of your hard-earned research

961
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,560
<30-13,CASTLE>找到你未能找到的东西
<30-13,CASTLE>to find something you never could.

962
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:07,120
<30-13,CASTLE>获得你未能获得的
<30-13,CASTLE>And now he was gonna get all the fame and fortune

963
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:08,570
<30-13,CASTLE>名与利
<30-13,CASTLE>that you never would.

964
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:12,320
<30-14,MARION>卡塞尔先生  你想象力可真丰富
<30-14,MARION>Mr. Castle, you really do have an overactive imagination.

965
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,960
<30-14,MARION>你没证据证明刚刚编造的故事
<30-14,MARION>You could no more prove that story you just spun

966
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,000
<30-14,MARION>就像你没法向别人证明灯神会从神灯中走出
<30-14,MARION>than you could prove that genies come out of lamps

967
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,440
<30-14,MARION>为你完成三个愿望
<30-14,MARION>and grant three wishes.

968
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:20,530
<30-14,MARION>其实  我有证据
<30-14,MARION>Actually, that's not true.

969
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:22,260
<30-15,ESPOSITO>警察搜查了你的房子
<30-15,ESPOSITO>Uniforms searched your home.

970
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:23,680
<30-15,ESPOSITO>找到了神灯
<30-15,ESPOSITO>They found the lamp.

971
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:27,240
<30-16,CASTLE>看来你藏宝物的本事
<30-16,CASTLE>I guess you're as good at hiding treasure

972
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:28,820
<30-16,CASTLE>跟你找宝物的本事一样烂
<30-16,CASTLE>as you are at finding it.

973
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:32,670
<30-17,ESPOSITO>贝克教授  你涉嫌谋杀拉斯·克洛斯和约瑞克·塞曾
<30-17,ESPOSITO>Dr. Baker, you're under arrest for the murder of Lars Cross

974
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:34,130
<30-17,ESPOSITO>被拘捕了
<30-17,ESPOSITO>and Yuruk Sezen.

975
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,150
<31-1,ESPOSITO>你还是小心为好  卡塞尔
<31-1,ESPOSITO>You better watch out, Castle.

976
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,820
<31-1,ESPOSITO>我可能会偷走你的金发美女哦
<31-1,ESPOSITO>I may have to steal your blonde.

977
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,240
<31-1,ESPOSITO>我还有两个愿望没有许
<31-1,ESPOSITO>I still have two wishes left.

978
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,460
<31-2,CASTLE>任何摩擦对你来说都没用的
<31-2,CASTLE>All the rubbing in the world's not gonna do you any good.

979
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:50,220
<31-2,CASTLE>我能说"那是她说的"吗
<31-2,CASTLE>Can I get a "That's what she said"?

980
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,540
<31-3,CASTLE>那是谁
<31-3,CASTLE>Oh, who's that?

981
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:56,640
<31-4,BECKETT>约旦王室的哈利德·哈西姆王子
<31-4,BECKETT>Prince Khalid Hasheim of the Jordanian royal family.

982
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:58,180
<31-4,BECKETT>他是来保释吉妮维芙的
<31-4,BECKETT>He's here to bail out Genevieve.

983
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:00,600
<31-5,CASTLE>我们似乎找到了神秘的X先生
<31-5,CASTLE>Methinks we've found our mysterious Mr. X.

984
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:05,850
<31-6,BECKETT>哈西姆王子  我是贝克特警监
<31-6,BECKETT>Prince Hasheim, I'm Captain Beckett.

985
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:07,140
<31-6,BECKETT>这位是卡塞尔先生
<31-6,BECKETT>This is Mr. Castle.

986
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:09,370
<31-7,CASTLE>或许我们该叫你X先生
<31-7,CASTLE>Or perhaps we should call you Mr. X?

987
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:11,060
<31-8,GENEVIEVE>X先生是我的雇主
<31-8,GENEVIEVE>Mr. X is my employer.

988
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:14,080
<31-8,GENEVIEVE>他雇佣我保护所罗门墓穴的物品
<31-8,GENEVIEVE>He paid me to protect the contents of Solomon's Tomb.

989
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:16,170
<31-9,PRINCE KHALID HASHEIM>没错  虽然我不认识这位先生
<31-9,PRINCE KHALID HASHEIM>Right, well, I don't know this gentleman,

990
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:18,030
<31-9,PRINCE KHALID HASHEIM>但帮助保护我领土历史的任何人
<31-9,PRINCE KHALID HASHEIM>but anyone who helps protect the history of my region

991
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:19,010
<31-9,PRINCE KHALID HASHEIM>都值得赞扬
<31-9,PRINCE KHALID HASHEIM>is to be applauded.

992
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:19,760
<31-9,PRINCE KHALID HASHEIM>当然
<31-9,PRINCE KHALID HASHEIM>Of course.

993
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:22,550
<31-10,CASTLE>那些古物和神灯会有什么下场
<31-10,CASTLE>So, what's gonna happen to the antiquities and the lamp now?

994
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:23,990
<31-11,HASHEIM>我不是专家
<31-11,HASHEIM>Well, I'm no expert,

995
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:24,860
<31-11,HASHEIM>但鉴于他们进入这里的方式
<31-11,HASHEIM>but given the way that they entered the country

996
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:26,340
<31-11,HASHEIM>还和谋杀案有牵扯
<31-11,HASHEIM>and their connection to a murder trial,

997
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:28,210
<31-11,HASHEIM>他们应该要受到好几年的诉讼保全
<31-11,HASHEIM>they'll be tied up in legal battles for years.

998
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:30,350
<31-12,BECKETT>很遗憾听到这样的事
<31-12,BECKETT>Oh. I'm sorry to hear that.

999
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:32,900
<31-12,BECKETT>X先生肯定十分失望吧
<31-12,BECKETT>I'm sure that Mr. X will be very disappointed

1000
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:35,660
<31-12,BECKETT>毕竟他如此大费周章地想要获得它们
<31-12,BECKETT>considering he worked so hard to procure them.

1001
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,170
<31-13,HASHEIM>这个我就不得而知了  警监
<31-13,HASHEIM>I don't know about that, Captain.

1002
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:39,110
<31-13,HASHEIM>如果有人希望保护无价的历史
<31-13,HASHEIM>If one wished to keep priceless history safe

1003
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:40,320
<31-13,HASHEIM>不被掠夺和侵犯
<31-13,HASHEIM>from looters and terrorists,

1004
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:42,310
<31-13,HASHEIM>没有什么地方比史密森尼[美国博物馆]地下室
<31-13,HASHEIM>there is no better place for them to wait out the conflict

1005
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:44,180
<31-13,HASHEIM>更安全的了
<31-13,HASHEIM>than in the basement of the Smithsonian.

1006
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:47,680
<31-14,HASHEIM>很高兴认识你们
<31-14,HASHEIM>It was a pleasure meeting you both.

<31-17,ESPOSITO>珍妮的分娩出了点问题
<31-17,ESPOSITO>There's been some complications with Jenny's labor.

1012
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,930
<32-1,RYAN>本来一切都好好的
<32-1,RYAN>Everything was normal, uh...

1013
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:11,460
<32-1,RYAN>直到珍妮开始换气过度
<32-1,RYAN>until Jenny started hyperventilating.

1014
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:13,150
<32-1,RYAN>她现在昏迷了
<32-1,RYAN>She lost consciousness.

1015
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:18,600
<32-1,RYAN>医生说可能是羊水栓塞
<32-1,RYAN>Doctors think it might be a, uh, amniotic fluid embolism.

1016
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,540
<32-2,RYAN>他们现在在尽力让她稳定
<32-2,RYAN>But they're -- they're trying to stabilize her now...

1017
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:25,900
<32-2,RYAN>好让孩子生下来
<32-2,RYAN>so that, uh... they can deliver the baby.

<32-5,CASTLE>Let's settle in.

1023

<33-1,BECKETT>Hey, so, um obviously, I don't believe in genies or wishes,

1024
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:55,200
<33-1,BECKETT>但假如是真的
<33-1,BECKETT>but just in case,

00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,040
<33-1,BECKETT>来保佑珍妮和她孩子
<33-1,BECKETT>for Jenny and the baby.

1027
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,120
<33-2,CASTLE>我已经这么做了
<33-2,CASTLE>I already did.

<33-2,CASTLE>两个愿望都用了

<33-11,LANIE>我也想要一个
<33-11,LANIE>Aww, I want one, too.

<33-12,BECKETT>So, if you see that, uh, genie again,

1042
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,160
<33-14,BECKETT>为什么不相信了
<33-14,BECKETT>Why the change of heart?

1043
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,210
<33-15,CASTLE>当然是因为你
<33-15,CASTLE>Well, because of you, of course.

<33-16,BECKETT>对你有影响了吗
<33-16,BECKETT>has finally rubbed off on you?

<33-17,CASTLE>No. No, no, no, nothing like that.

1047
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:57,540
<33-17,CASTLE>我不需要灯神  只是因为
<33-17,CASTLE>I have no need for genies simply because

00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:00,310
<33-17,CASTLE>我已经拥有了我想要的一切
<33-17,CASTLE>I already have everything I could ever wish for.
