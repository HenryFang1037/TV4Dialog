29
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:25,530
<2-6,ALEXIS>事情不能就这样结束  我们肯定还能做点什么
<2-6,ALEXIS>This can't be it. There's got to be something more we can do.

30
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,960
<2-6,ALEXIS>我们打算再次检测的化验样本呢  还有...
<2-6,ALEXIS>What about the lab work we were gonna test again, or what about--

31
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,730
<2-7,MCDONALD>阿丽克西斯  我们尽力了
<2-7,MCDONALD>Alexis, we've played every card.

32
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,390
<2-7,MCDONALD>有时好人没法胜诉
<2-7,MCDONALD>Sometimes the good guys don't win.

33
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,310
<3-1,RICHARD CASTLE>我不会放弃的
<3-1,RICHARD CASTLE>I am not giving up.

34
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,120
<3-1,RICHARD CASTLE>你知道为什么吗  因为这是最棒的主意
<3-1,RICHARD CASTLE>And you know why? Because it's the best idea ever.

35
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,190
<3-2,KATE BECKETT>卡塞尔  我不要在太空结婚
<3-2,KATE BECKETT>Castle, I am not getting married in space.

36
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,950
<3-3,CASTLE>为什么  我们会是第一对
<3-3,CASTLE>Why not? We could be the first.

37
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,110
<3-3,CASTLE>商业太空飞行再过个几年就有了
<3-3,CASTLE>Commercial space flight is only a couple years away,

38
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:57,070
<3-3,CASTLE>而你说过想让婚礼很特别
<3-3,CASTLE>and you said you wanted it to be special.

39
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:58,480
<3-4,BECKETT>是啊  因为
<3-4,BECKETT>Yes, because when I was a little girl,

40
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,460
<3-4,BECKETT>我小时候  梦想中的婚礼就是
<3-4,BECKETT>imagining my wedding day being stuck in a small tin can

41
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,900
<3-4,BECKETT>被困在一个小锡罐里
<3-4,BECKETT>with a thousand tons of rocket fuel strapped to my ass

42
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,350
<3-4,BECKETT>还有一千吨的火箭燃料绑在我屁股上
<3-4,BECKETT>was exactly what I had in mind.

43
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:06,400
<3-5,CASTLE>那我们就意见一致了
<3-5,CASTLE>Then we agree.

44
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,300
<3-6,BECKETT>如果你这周末不想去看婚礼场所
<3-6,BECKETT>If you don't wanna go and look at wedding venues this weekend,

45
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,370
<3-6,BECKETT>直说就好
<3-6,BECKETT>then just say so.

46
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:13,040
<3-7,CASTLE>我这周末不想去看婚礼场所
<3-7,CASTLE>I don't wanna go look at wedding venues this weekend.

47
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:14,200
<3-8,BECKETT>真可惜
<3-8,BECKETT>Too bad.

48
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,220
<3-9,BECKETT>怎么了
<3-9,BECKETT>What?

49
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,160
<3-10,CASTLE>没事  只是
<3-10,CASTLE>Nothing. It's, um,

50
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:21,690
<3-10,CASTLE>阿丽克西斯正在忙的课程的短信提醒
<3-10,CASTLE>text alert on the project Alexis has been working on.

51
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:22,970
<3-11,BECKETT>我还以为你们不说话呢
<3-11,BECKETT>I thought you guys weren't talking.

52
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:23,820
<3-11,BECKETT>是的
<3-11,BECKETT>We're not.

53
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:26,130
<3-12,CASTLE>或者说  是她不说
<3-12,CASTLE>Rather... she isn't.

54
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,790
<3-12,CASTLE>我侮辱了她男友而已  要判几年刑啊
<3-12,CASTLE>So I insulted her boyfriend. What's the prison sentence on that?

55
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:31,130
<3-13,BECKETT>卡塞尔  给她一些时间  她会想通的
<3-13,BECKETT>Oh, Castle, just give her some time. She'll get over it.

56
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,470
<3-13,BECKETT>你太天真了
<3-13,BECKETT>That's what you think.

57
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,810
<3-14,CASTLE>她三岁时  我不肯给她买糖
<3-14,CASTLE>Once when she was 3, I refused to buy her a candy bar.

58
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:36,740
<3-14,CASTLE>她屏住呼吸  直到昏了过去
<3-14,CASTLE>She held her breath until she passed out.

59
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:39,800
<3-14,CASTLE>你不知道她有多执拗
<3-14,CASTLE>You have no idea how determined she can be.

60
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:42,440
<4-1,JAVIER ESPOSITO>阿丽克西斯  我们按你的要求查看了案件卷宗
<4-1,JAVIER ESPOSITO>Alexis, we went through the case files like you asked.

61
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,200
<4-1,JAVIER ESPOSITO>我得说
<4-1,JAVIER ESPOSITO>I gotta say,

62
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,170
<4-1,JAVIER ESPOSITO>里面没有一点证明他无辜的线索
<4-1,JAVIER ESPOSITO>there's nothing in there that says this guy's innocent.

63
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:47,050
<4-2,ALEXIS>那我们交给纽约化验室重新检测的
<4-2,ALEXIS>What about the swabs from Kim Tolbert's body

64
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:49,310
<4-2,ALEXIS>金·塔伯特尸体化验标本呢
<4-2,ALEXIS>that we submitted to the New York trace lab for re-testing?

65
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,830
<4-2,ALEXIS>他们都收到几周了
<4-2,ALEXIS>I mean, they've had them for weeks.

66
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:53,470
<4-3,KEVIN RYAN>我们每天都在打电话催促
<4-3,KEVIN RYAN>Well, we've been calling every day to move things along,

67
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,620
<4-3,KEVIN RYAN>但那不是我们的辖区
<4-3,KEVIN RYAN>but it's not in our jurisdiction.

68
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,220
<4-3,KEVIN RYAN>你不明白
<4-3,KEVIN RYAN>You don't understand.

69
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,450
<4-4,ALEXIS>除非我们做点什么  否则有人三天后就要死了
<4-4,ALEXIS>A man's going to die in three days unless we do something.

70
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:02,800
<4-5,RYAN>我们很明白  但我们帮不上忙
<4-5,RYAN>Oh, we do understand. There's just not much that we can do.

71
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:04,020
<4-6,ESPOSITO>你爸爸呢
<4-6,ESPOSITO>What about your dad?

72
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,620
<4-6,ESPOSITO>你跟他说过这起案子吗
<4-6,ESPOSITO>Have you talked to him about this case?

73
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,440
<4-7,RYAN>是啊  也许他能发现别人不能发现的疑点
<4-7,RYAN>Yeah, maybe he'll spot something that no one else did.

74
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:26,920
<5-2,ALEXIS>那...
<5-2,ALEXIS>So...

75
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:28,660
<5-3,CASTLE>你来了
<5-3,CASTLE>you're here.

76
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:32,970
<5-4,ALEXIS>我需要你的帮助
<5-4,ALEXIS>I need your help.

77
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,850
<5-4,ALEXIS>但我向你求助
<5-4,ALEXIS>But just because I'm asking

78
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,570
<5-4,ALEXIS>并不代表我俩之间就没事了
<5-4,ALEXIS>doesn't mean things are okay between us.

79
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,140
<5-4,ALEXIS>我还生你的气  好吗
<5-4,ALEXIS>I'm still mad at you, okay?

80
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,190
<5-5,CASTLE>好吧  出什么事了
<5-5,CASTLE>Okay. What's up?

81
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,930
<5-6,ALEXIS>我和我的刑法教授在忙活
<5-6,ALEXIS>I've been working on this innocence review case

82
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,230
<5-6,ALEXIS>一起无辜复审案件
<5-6,ALEXIS>with my criminal law professor.

83
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:49,610
<5-6,ALEXIS>这人因杀了他的邻居  一个高中女孩
<5-6,ALEXIS>This guy is on death row for killing his neighbor--

84
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:51,100
<5-6,ALEXIS>而被判死刑  但不是他干的
<5-6,ALEXIS>a high school girl-- but he didn't do it,

85
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,600
<5-6,ALEXIS>他们要为此处决他
<5-6,ALEXIS>and they're about to execute him for it.

86
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,110
<5-7,CASTLE>你怎么知道不是他干的
<5-7,CASTLE>How do you know he didn't do it?

87
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:54,820
<5-8,ALEXIS>第一
<5-8,ALEXIS>Well, for one thing,

88
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,800
<5-8,ALEXIS>他四个月前做过肌腱套手术
<5-8,ALEXIS>he had rotator cuff surgery four months before.

89
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,280
<5-8,ALEXIS>他没法挥动杀死被害人的拨火棍
<5-8,ALEXIS>He couldn't have swung the fireplace poker used to kill the victim.

90
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,390
<5-9,CASTLE>肾上腺素激增时
<5-9,CASTLE>Well, under the rush of adrenaline,

91
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:02,440
<5-9,CASTLE>人们能做到的事能吓你一跳
<5-9,CASTLE>you'd be surprised what people are capable of.

92
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,890
<5-10,ALEXIS>你的口气和检察官一样
<5-10,ALEXIS>You sound just like the prosecutor.

93
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:05,980
<5-10,ALEXIS>但还有更多事实
<5-10,ALEXIS>But there's more.

94
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,090
<5-10,ALEXIS>他们在死者后门外的泥土上
<5-10,ALEXIS>They found fresh tire tracks in the dirt

95
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:10,570
<5-10,ALEXIS>发现了刚压过的轮胎痕迹  自行车的痕迹
<5-10,ALEXIS>outside the victim's back door-- bicycle treads.

96
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,250
<5-11,CASTLE>而弗兰克没有自行车
<5-11,CASTLE>And Frank didn't own a bike.

97
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,760
<5-12,ALEXIS>没有  他那时24岁  他修...汽车
<5-12,ALEXIS>No, he was 24 then. He worked on... cars.

98
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,480
<5-12,ALEXIS>等等
<5-12,ALEXIS>Wait.

99
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,920
<5-12,ALEXIS>你怎么知道他的名字的
<5-12,ALEXIS>How do you know his name?

100
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,820
<5-13,CASTLE>你刚说的
<5-13,CASTLE>You just said it.

101
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,490
<5-14,ALEXIS>我没有
<5-14,ALEXIS>No. I didn't.

102
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,650
<5-15,ALEXIS>你知道案子的事  怎么知道的
<5-15,ALEXIS>You know about the case. How?

103
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,690
<5-16,CASTLE>是啊  怎么知道的
<5-16,CASTLE>Yeah... how?

104
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,430
<5-16,CASTLE>我一定是在埃斯波西托桌子上看见了文件
<5-16,CASTLE>I must have seen the file on Esposito's desk.

105
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,820
<5-17,ALEXIS>-你有查探我的情况  -才没有
<5-17,ALEXIS>- You've been checking up on me. - No! No.

106
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:36,110
<5-18,CASTLE>有一点吧
<5-18,CASTLE>Well, a little, yes.

107
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,610
<5-19,ALEXIS>-你真是不可理喻  -忍不住嘛
<5-19,ALEXIS>- You're unbelievable. - Couldn't help it.

108
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,860
<5-20,CASTLE>你是我女儿  我对你的生活感兴趣
<5-20,CASTLE>You're my daughter. I'm interested in your life,

109
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,610
<5-20,CASTLE>但你不回我电话
<5-20,CASTLE>but you won't return my calls.

110
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:43,620
<5-21,ALEXIS>那你有什么发现吗
<5-21,ALEXIS>Okay, so did you find anything in the file?

111
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,690
<5-21,ALEXIS>比如有用的线索
<5-21,ALEXIS>Anything that can help?

112
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,590
<5-22,CASTLE>阿丽克西斯  他有前科
<5-22,CASTLE>Alexis, he did have priors.

113
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,510
<5-22,CASTLE>你为什么觉得他是无辜的
<5-22,CASTLE>What makes you think he's innocent?

114
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,680
<5-23,ALEXIS>因为我了解他  爸
<5-23,ALEXIS>Because I know him, dad.

115
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,630
<5-23,ALEXIS>我和他共度过时光  他不是凶手
<5-23,ALEXIS>I've spent time with him. He's not a killer.

116
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:57,480
<5-23,ALEXIS>我知道证据对他不利  但他没有杀人
<5-23,ALEXIS>I know what the evidence says, but he didn't do this.

117
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,000
<5-23,ALEXIS>我要你和我一起去宾夕法尼亚州
<5-23,ALEXIS>I need you to come to Pennsylvania with me.

118
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:02,890
<5-23,ALEXIS>我要你帮我证明
<5-23,ALEXIS>I need you to help me prove it.

119
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,520
<6-1,BECKETT>没事  我理解
<6-1,BECKETT>No, come on. I get it.

120
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,810
<6-2,CASTLE>也就去几天
<6-2,CASTLE>It would only be for a couple of days,

121
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,880
<6-2,CASTLE>因为也只剩几天时间了
<6-2,CASTLE>'cause that's pretty much all the time there is left,

122
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,070
<6-2,CASTLE>而且我有机会和阿丽克西斯重归于好
<6-2,CASTLE>and it's a chance for Alexis and me to reconnect.

123
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,430
<6-3,BECKETT>卡塞尔  你没必要解释

<7-2,MCDONALD>我们很久没有一起自驾游过了
<7-2,MCDONALD>It has been a long time since we have taken a road trip together.

<7-3,CASTLE>记得我们去阿米什乡村那次吗
<7-3,CASTLE>Remember the time we went to Amish Country?

00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,190
<7-3,CASTLE>最后被那头牛追逐
<7-3,CASTLE>Ended up getting chased by that cow?

133
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:44,360
<7-4,ALEXIS>爸  这不是自驾游  不是为了玩乐
<7-4,ALEXIS>Dad, this isn't a road trip, and this isn't about fun.

134
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,120
<7-4,ALEXIS>而是为了在不到70小时内
<7-4,ALEXIS>This is about having less than 70 hours

135
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,700
<7-4,ALEXIS>拯救死刑犯的性命

<7-5,CASTLE>这一路会很颠簸
<7-5,CASTLE>Gonna be a bumpy ride.

<7-5,CASTLE>话说

<8-1,CASTLE>How is Pi? Everything still good?

151
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,740
<8-2,ALEXIS>你为什么要问派的事
<8-2,ALEXIS>Why are you asking about Pi?

152
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,160
<8-3,CASTLE>我只是想

<8-9,CASTLE>就算有又怎样  有那么糟糕吗
<8-9,CASTLE>And what if I was? Would that be so bad?

163
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,250
<8-10,ALEXIS>我以为你只是来办案的
<8-10,ALEXIS>I just thought you were here for the case.

164
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:37,240
<8-11,CASTLE>我就是来办案的
<8-11,CASTLE>I am.

165
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:38,980
<8-12,ALEXIS>那我们离开到现在
<8-12,ALEXIS>Then how come you haven't asked a single question

166
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:40,160
<8-12,ALEXIS>你怎么没问过一个与案情有关的问题
<8-12,ALEXIS>about it since we left?

<8-14,ALEXIS>他这人不太好相处
<8-14,ALEXIS>He's a little rough around the edges,

174
00:06:58,450 --> 00:06:59,560
<8-14,ALEXIS>但他很有爱心

<8-19,CASTLE>Is it one of those prison pen pal romance things?

<8-22,ALEXIS>每场听证会  每次上诉
<8-22,ALEXIS>Every hearing, every appeal.

187
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:22,100

<9-22,ALEXIS>但我爸爸很擅长发掘事情的真相
<9-22,ALEXIS>But my dad's a genius at uncovering the real story.

<9-22,ALEXIS>弗兰克  我知道这种事你经历过太多次
<9-22,ALEXIS>Frank, I know you've been through this more times

224
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,750
<9-22,ALEXIS>已经超出你的承受范围了  但如果可以
<9-22,ALEXIS>than you can stomach, but if you can...

225
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:17,990
<9-23,MAGGIE>告诉他那晚发生了什么吧
<9-23,MAGGIE>Tell him what happened that night.

226
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:23,420
<9-23,MAGGIE>弗兰克
<9-23,MAGGIE>Frank.

227
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,060
<9-24,FRANK>当时我在修我的科迈罗
<9-24,FRANK>I was working on my Camaro.

228
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:30,540
<9-24,FRANK>那时我除了睡觉  所有时间都花在修它上
<9-24,FRANK>I spent every waking hour with it back then.

229
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:33,740
<9-24,FRANK>那天我正在修它的排气系统
<9-24,FRANK>That night I was working on the exhaust system

230
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,780
<9-24,FRANK>家里的警报响了
<9-24,FRANK>my house alarm went off.

231
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:39,740
<10-1,FRANK>我在做焊接  烟雾引发了车库的警报
<10-1,FRANK>I was doing some welding, and the smoke set off the garage alarm.

232
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,690
<10-1,FRANK>解除密码是stingray7
<10-1,FRANK>the code is stingray7.

233
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:47,150
<10-2,FRANK>现在好了  谢谢
<10-2,FRANK>It's off now. Thank you.

234
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:50,960
<10-3,FRANK>就在那时  我听到了街对面的尖叫
<10-3,FRANK>That's when I heard the screams across the street.

235
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:52,660
<10-3,FRANK>于是我跑过去看发生了什么
<10-3,FRANK>I ran over to see what happened.

236
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:55,580
<10-4,FRANK>有人吗
<10-4,FRANK>Hello?

237
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:57,700
<10-4,FRANK>没事吧
<10-4,FRANK>Is everyone all right?

238
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:04,280
<10-5,FRANK>后门是打开的  于是我走了进去
<10-5,FRANK>Back door was open, so I went inside.

239
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,400
<10-5,FRANK>她躺在那里
<10-5,FRANK>She was lying there.

240
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,420
<11-1,FRANK>到处都是血...
<11-1,FRANK>The blood was, uh...

241
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,640
<11-1,FRANK>不管发生了什么  我都来晚了
<11-1,FRANK>Whatever happened, I was too late.

242
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,980
<11-2,FRANK>我听到了警笛声  顿时慌了神
<11-2,FRANK>I heard the sirens, and I panicked.

243
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,270
<11-2,FRANK>我知道这会让人怎么想
<11-2,FRANK>I mean, I knew how it would look,

244
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:20,520
<11-2,FRANK>所以我抓了块破布  想擦掉我所有的指纹
<11-2,FRANK>so I took a rag and tried to wipe down all my prints,

245
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:22,000
<11-2,FRANK>但是我没时间了
<11-2,FRANK>But I ran out of time.

246
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,740
<11-2,FRANK>我手上有她的血
<11-2,FRANK>I had her blood on me,

247
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,630
<11-2,FRANK>还有案底  当然不会有什么好下场
<11-2,FRANK>a police record. It... went the way you'd expect.

248
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:30,210
<12-1,FRANK>你的住宅安保公司呢
<12-1,FRANK>And what about your home security company?

249
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:31,980
<12-2,CASTLE>-他们有你打电话的记录吗  -有
<12-2,CASTLE>- Did they have a record of your call? - Yes.

250
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:35,100
<12-3,ALEXIS>但控方争辩说他打完电话仍有足够的时间行凶
<12-3,ALEXIS>But the prosecution argued it still left plenty of time.

251
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,790
<12-4,CASTLE>你跟金·塔伯特很熟吗
<12-4,CASTLE>How well did you know Kim Tolbert?

252
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,680
<12-5,FRANK>没多熟  她和她妈在那住了几年了
<12-5,FRANK>Not that well. I mean, her mom and her lived there a few years,

253
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,900
<12-5,FRANK>金跟我调过情
<12-5,FRANK>And... Kim'd flirt with me a little bit.

254
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,510
<12-5,FRANK>我很友好地回应  仅此而已
<12-5,FRANK>I was friendly, but that was it.

255
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,970
<12-6,MAGGIE>他们提交了她的日记作为证物
<12-6,MAGGIE>They entered her diary into record.

256
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,990
<12-6,MAGGIE>上面写她对弗兰克有好感
<12-6,MAGGIE>She wrote that she had a crush on Frank,

257
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,820
<12-6,MAGGIE>于是控方就把弗兰克塑造成了勾引少女的色魔
<12-6,MAGGIE>so the prosecutor made Frank out to be some kind of predator.

258
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:53,040
<12-7,CASTLE>你跑进房子的时候  没看到别人吗
<12-7,CASTLE>And you didn't... see anyone as you ran into the house?

259
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,770
<12-8,FRANK>没有  他们一定是在我赶到前都跑了
<12-8,FRANK>No. They must have bolted out the back before I got there.

260
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:58,170
<12-9,CASTLE>在那之前呢
<12-9,CASTLE>Well, what about back then?

261
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:00,080
<12-9,CASTLE>她跟什么人有过节吗
<12-9,CASTLE>Anybody she was having a problem with?

262
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,150
<12-9,CASTLE>莱尔·戈麦斯  金高中时的前男友
<12-9,CASTLE>Lyle Gomez, Kim's high school ex-boyfriend.

263
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:09,330
<12-10,MAGGIE>他们的感情非常...轰轰烈烈
<12-10,MAGGIE>They had a very... stormy relationship.

264
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:13,100
<12-10,MAGGIE>而且  她遇害一周前把他甩了
<12-10,MAGGIE>Plus she dumped him a week before she was killed.

265
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:14,730
<12-11,CASTLE>警方找过他吗
<12-11,CASTLE>Police talk to him?

266
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:16,650
<12-12,FRANK>没必要找他  他们已经抓到我了
<12-12,FRANK>Well, they didn't have to. They had me.

267
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,270
<12-12,FRANK>卡塞尔先生  我只有三天的命了
<12-12,FRANK>Mr. Castle, I've got three days left on God's earth.

268
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,580
<12-12,FRANK>我不需要你找出真正的凶手
<12-12,FRANK>I don't need you to find the real killer.

269
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,380
<12-12,FRANK>只要有人能证明我是无辜的就行了
<12-12,FRANK>I just need somebody to prove it wasn't me.

270
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:36,070
<13-1,BECKETT>卡塞尔  慢慢说  冷静点
<13-1,BECKETT>Castle, take it easy. Calm down.

271
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:36,970
<13-1,BECKETT>冷静点
<13-1,BECKETT>Calm down?

272
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,850
<13-2,CASTLE>你真该看看这些人看我的眼神
<13-2,CASTLE>You should have seen the way these people looked at me.

273
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,310
<13-3,BECKETT>好像我是什么救世主一样
<13-3,BECKETT>Like I'm some kind of savior.

274
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,240
<13-4,CASTLE>我都不知道他是不是无辜的
<13-4,CASTLE>I-I don't even know if he's innocent.

275
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:44,570
<13-3,BECKETT>我能帮上什么忙
<13-3,BECKETT>Okay, how can I help?

276
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,410
<13-4,CASTLE>我都不知道我能不能帮上忙
<13-4,CASTLE>I don't even know if I can help. I mean...

277
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,440
<13-4,CASTLE>要是我帮不了怎么办
<13-4,CASTLE>what if I can't?

278
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:50,560
<13-4,CASTLE>阿丽克西斯永远不会原谅我的
<13-4,CASTLE>Alexis would never forgive me.

279
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,420
<13-5,BECKETT>尽力就好  卡塞尔  她很爱你
<13-5,BECKETT>Just do your best, Castle. I mean, she loves you.

280
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,120
<13-5,BECKETT>而且还有我呢  支持你们
<13-5,BECKETT>And I'm here... for both of you.

281
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:58,890
<13-6,CASTLE>她来了  我得挂了
<13-6,CASTLE>She's coming. I gotta go.

282
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:03,760
<13-6,CASTLE>准备好了吗
<13-6,CASTLE>Ready to get started?

283
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:04,700
<13-6,CASTLE>走吧
<13-6,CASTLE>Let's go.

284
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:15,870
<14-1,ALEXIS>这些就是案子的所有相关资料了
<14-1,ALEXIS>This is everything spanning the life of the case.

285
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,080
<14-2,CASTLE>你的教授起码可以
<14-2,CASTLE>Well, the least your professor could've done

286
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,670
<14-2,CASTLE>弄点索引嘛
<14-2,CASTLE>is throw in some cliffs notes.

287
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:22,390
<14-2,CASTLE>关于金的前男友莱尔·戈麦斯  我们有什么线索
<14-2,CASTLE>So what do we know about this ex-boyfriend of kim's? Lyle Gomez.

288
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,690
<14-3,ALEXIS>他是个大学的橄榄球队员
<14-3,ALEXIS>Uh, was a varsity football player.

289
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,240
<14-3,ALEXIS>跟金有段起起伏伏的恋情
<14-3,ALEXIS>Hot and cold relationship with Kim.

290
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:28,080
<14-3,ALEXIS>认识他的人都说他脾气很不好
<14-3,ALEXIS>Everyone that knew him said he had a temper.

291
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:29,640
<14-4,CASTLE>你们找过他了吗
<14-4,CASTLE>Do you guys talk to him?

292
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:31,650
<14-5,ALEXIS>麦克唐纳德教授和辩方律师曾试图找他谈谈
<14-5,ALEXIS>Professor Mcdonald and the defense lawyer tried,

293
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:34,300
<14-5,ALEXIS>但莱尔说不想再提这事了
<14-5,ALEXIS>But Lyle told them he didn't want to relive it.

294
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,660
<14-5,ALEXIS>说太痛苦了
<14-5,ALEXIS>Said it was too painful.

295
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,760
<14-6,CASTLE>没有证据表明可能是他干的吗
<14-6,CASTLE>And there's no evidence that indicates he might have done it?

296
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,470
<14-6,CASTLE>完全没有
<14-6,CASTLE>Nothing at all?

297
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:44,200
<14-8,CASTLE>尸体周围的地板上这些小东西是什么
<14-8,CASTLE>What are all these little things on the floor around the body?

298
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:47,340
<14-9,ALEXIS>吊坠  他们在扭打时扯坏了她的手镯
<14-9,ALEXIS>Charms. They broke off her bracelet during the struggle.

299
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,550
<14-10,CASTLE>那么在致命一击之前
<14-10,CASTLE>So before the attack,

300
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:50,640
<14-10,CASTLE>可能发生了推搡
<14-10,CASTLE>there might have been some pushing and shoving.

301
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,880
<14-10,CASTLE>爱人吵架可能会先这样
<14-10,CASTLE>Lovers' quarrels can start like that

302
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,150
<14-10,CASTLE>一不小心就酿成了悲剧
<14-10,CASTLE>before they turn to something else.

303
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:54,350
<14-11,ALEXIS>可除了玛吉的说法外
<14-11,ALEXIS>But aside from Maggie's theory,

304
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:56,150
<14-11,ALEXIS>其他证据联系不到莱尔身上
<14-11,ALEXIS>there's nothing tying Lyle to any of this.

305
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,700
<14-11,ALEXIS>但是...或许你会发现我们所遗漏的
<14-11,ALEXIS>But... maybe you'll see something we missed.

306
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:04,640
<15-1,BECKETT>被送交到化验室的
<15-1,BECKETT>Hey, so that evidence the innocence review

307
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:05,650
<15-1,BECKETT>无辜复审报告
<15-1,BECKETT>submitted to the trace lab--

308
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:07,530
<15-1,BECKETT>他们查到什么程度了
<15-1,BECKETT>how close are they to looking at it?

309
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,350
<15-2,ESPOSITO>据我们所知  要花上几周
<15-2,ESPOSITO>Well, from what we heard, it's gonna take weeks,

310
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:11,010
<15-2,ESPOSITO>也就是说  来不及
<15-2,ESPOSITO>which means they'll never get to it in time.

311
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:16,660
<15-2,ESPOSITO>怎么了
<15-2,ESPOSITO>What?

312
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:18,550
<15-2,ESPOSITO>据大家所说
<15-2,ESPOSITO>Well, by all accounts,

313
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:21,370
<16-1,ALEXIS>金是个人见人爱的聪明美女
<16-1,ALEXIS>Kim was a bright and beautiful girl who everyone loved.

314
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:22,610
<16-2,CASTLE>没听说她有树敌
<16-2,CASTLE>She had no enemies to speak of,

315
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:25,200
<16-3,ALEXIS>也没线索指向弗兰克之外的人
<16-3,ALEXIS>and nothing points to anyone other than Frank.

316
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:27,220
<16-3,ALEXIS>因为大家觉得没必要怀疑弗兰克之外的人
<16-3,ALEXIS>Because they didn't look at anyone other than Frank.

317
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:30,430
<16-4,CASTLE>也许是因为...就是弗兰克干的
<16-4,CASTLE>Or maybe because... it was Frank.

318
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:34,890
<16-4,CASTLE>抱歉  阿丽克西斯  有时...
<16-4,CASTLE>Look, I'm sorry, Alexis. It's just sometimes--

319
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:37,750
<16-5,ALEXIS>没关系  如果真是弗兰克  他的动机是什么
<16-5,ALEXIS>Okay, fine. But if it was Frank, what was his motive?

320
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:39,990
<16-6,CASTLE>好吧
<16-6,CASTLE>Right.

321
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:43,120
<16-7,OFFICER TED LANE>你们这些做无辜复审的人就是不懂得放弃  是吗
<16-7,OFFICER TED LANE>Wow. You innocence review folks just won't give up, will you?

322
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:46,190
<16-8,CASTLE>需要帮忙吗  雷恩警官
<16-8,CASTLE>Can I help you, officer... "Lane"?

323
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,290
<16-9,LANE>金的谋杀案把这里搅得鸡犬不宁
<16-9,LANE>Kim's murder tore this town apart. I guess, uh,

324
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,480
<16-9,LANE>我们想知道你们都在图什么
<16-9,LANE>we're just wondering what you all are fighting for.

325
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,750
<16-10,ALEXIS>公正
<16-10,ALEXIS>Justice.

326
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,640
<16-10,ALEXIS>公正
<16-10,ALEXIS>Justice?

327
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:57,140
<16-11,LANIE>我们抓到他时  他手里沾满她的鲜血
<16-11,LANIE>He had her blood on his hands when they caught him.

328
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:59,030
<16-11,LANIE>他手里拿着
<16-11,LANIE>He was holding the shop rag

329
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,930
<16-11,LANIE>擦拭过犯罪现场血迹的抹布  你还想要公正
<16-11,LANIE>that he used to wipe down the crime scene. You want justice?

330
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:03,840
<16-11,LANIE>让他见上帝去吧
<16-11,LANIE>Let him meet his maker.

331
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:10,860
<16-12,CASTLE>他们一直这么不友善吗
<16-12,CASTLE>Has it been like that the whole time?

332
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:11,910
<16-13,ALEXIS>差不多吧
<16-13,ALEXIS>Pretty much.

333
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,640
<16-14,CASTLE>好  我们再来过一遍
<16-14,CASTLE>Okay, let's go over this again.

334
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:19,110
<16-14,CASTLE>弗兰克听到叫声  跑了过去
<16-14,CASTLE>Frank hears a scream. He runs across the way.

335
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:21,020
<16-14,CASTLE>他使劲敲门  门锁着
<16-14,CASTLE>He bangs on the door. It's locked.

336
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:22,380
<16-14,CASTLE>他跑到了后门
<16-14,CASTLE>He runs around the back.

337
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:24,320
<16-15,ALEXIS>他发现后门开着  就走了进去
<16-15,ALEXIS>He finds the back door open and goes inside.

338
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:26,840
<16-16,CASTLE>后门开着  等等
<16-16,CASTLE>Back door was open. Wait.

339
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,720
<16-16,CASTLE>案发时间是几月  十一月吗
<16-16,CASTLE>What time of year was the murder--November?

340
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,720
<16-17,ALEXIS>对  13号  怎么了
<16-17,ALEXIS>Yeah, the 13th. why?

341
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,530
<16-18,CASTLE>1998年  那晚的温度是...
<16-18,CASTLE>1998. Temperature that night was...

342
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,290
<16-18,CASTLE>40度[4摄氏度]
<16-18,CASTLE>40 degrees.

343
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,240
<16-19,ALEXIS>那又怎样
<16-19,ALEXIS>So?

344
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,400
<16-20,CASTLE>天气太冷  金不会开着门的
<16-20,CASTLE>So that's far too cold for Kim to have left the door open.

345
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,300
<16-20,CASTLE>但据弗兰克所说  门是开着的
<16-20,CASTLE>Yet according to Frank, it was open,

346
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,370
<16-20,CASTLE>可以推断凶手另有其人
<16-20,CASTLE>presumably because someone else committed the crime.

347
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:47,910
<16-21,ALEXIS>对  可大家都认为他在说谎
<16-21,ALEXIS>Yeah, but everyone thinks he's lying.

348
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,930
<16-22,CASTLE>没错  可他们看不到的  没人能看到的
<16-22,CASTLE>Yes, but what they don't see, what no one sees

349
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,620
<16-22,CASTLE>是我们能证明他是不是在说谎
<16-22,CASTLE>is that we can prove whether or not he was lying.

350
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,310
<16-22,CASTLE>快走  我去取车  你付账单
<16-22,CASTLE>Come on. I'll get the car. You pay the check.

351
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:58,700
<16-22,CASTLE>等等  老爸
<16-22,CASTLE>Wait. Dad?

352
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:04,100
<17-1,ALEXIS>拜托  老爸  你能告诉我你在干什么吗
<17-1,ALEXIS>Come on, dad. Will you please tell me what you're doing?

353
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,580
<17-2,CASTLE>如果弗兰克有罪
<17-2,CASTLE>If Frank is guilty,

354
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:10,140
<17-2,CASTLE>那后门就是他开的  那就是说...
<17-2,CASTLE>then he would have opened the back door, which means...

355
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:11,510
<17-2,CASTLE>他会擦拭门把手
<17-2,CASTLE>He would have wiped down the doorknob

356
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,700
<17-2,CASTLE>擦掉指纹
<17-2,CASTLE>to get rid of his fingerprints.

357
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,760
<17-3,ALEXIS>可如果他说的是事实  当时后门
<17-3,ALEXIS>But if he's telling the truth and the back door

358
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,950
<17-3,ALEXIS>的确开着  他就没必要去擦掉
<17-3,ALEXIS>was already open, he wouldn't have needed to wipe it

359
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,020
<17-3,ALEXIS>因为他没碰过
<17-3,ALEXIS>because he never touched it.

360
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:20,010
<17-4,CASTLE>那就意味着那晚有其他人去了金家
<17-4,CASTLE>And that would mean someone else was there that night.

361
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:21,990
<17-4,CASTLE>问题是  鉴证组
<17-4,CASTLE>Question is, did C.S.U.

362
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:24,230
<17-4,CASTLE>验过门把手上的指纹了吗
<17-4,CASTLE>dust that doorknob for fingerprints?

363
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,080
<17-4,CASTLE>找到了
<17-4,CASTLE>Here it is.

364
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:27,430
<17-4,CASTLE>-验过了  -结果呢
<17-4,CASTLE>- They did. - And?

365
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:30,950
<17-6,CASTLE>结果是...指纹被擦干净了
<17-6,CASTLE>And... it was wiped clean.

366
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,970
<17-6,CASTLE>抱歉  亲爱的  他说谎了
<17-6,CASTLE>Sorry, sweetie. He lied.

367
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,560
<17-7,ALEXIS>-可这完全说不通  -我知道
<17-7,ALEXIS>- But it doesn't make any sense. - I know.

368
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,210
<17-8,CASTLE>跟你一样  我也希望他是无辜的
<17-8,CASTLE>I wanted to believe it as much as you.

369
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:39,700
<17-9,ALEXIS>不  我是指这份报告
<17-9,ALEXIS>No, I mean this report.

370
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,370
<17-9,ALEXIS>上面说后门把手干干净净的
<17-9,ALEXIS>It says the back doorknob was totally clean--

371
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:43,510
<17-9,ALEXIS>没指纹  什么都没
<17-9,ALEXIS>No prints, no nothing.

372
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,410
<17-9,ALEXIS>所以弗兰克不可能擦拭过
<17-9,ALEXIS>So Frank couldn't have wiped it down.

373
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:47,600
<17-9,ALEXIS>弗兰克用的抹布上沾满了
<17-9,ALEXIS>The shop rag Frank used was covered in grease

374
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:49,790
<17-9,ALEXIS>他修车沾上的油  他们在其他地方
<17-9,ALEXIS>from working on his car. They found traces of grease

375
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,950
<17-9,ALEXIS>发现了他擦拭指纹留下的油渍
<17-9,ALEXIS>in other places where he wiped down his prints,

376
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,380
<17-9,ALEXIS>可没有提到门把手上有
<17-9,ALEXIS>but there's no mention of it on the doorknob.

377
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,130
<17-9,ALEXIS>报告上没写
<17-9,ALEXIS>It isn't in the report.

378
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:57,710
<17-9,ALEXIS>老爸  如果上面没有油渍
<17-9,ALEXIS>Dad, if there wasn't any grease...

379
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,540
<17-10,CASTLE>那就说明有其他人
<17-10,CASTLE>Then someone else was there,

380
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,760
<17-10,CASTLE>在弗兰克到达前擦了门把手
<17-10,CASTLE>wiped down the doorknob before Frank got there,

381
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,340
<17-10,CASTLE>把指纹擦掉了
<17-10,CASTLE>getting rid of their own prints.

382
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:05,130
<17-10,CASTLE>还有其他人出现在犯罪现场
<17-10,CASTLE>Someone else was there that night.

383
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,000
<17-10,CASTLE>亲爱的  你说得对
<17-10,CASTLE>Sweetie, you were right.

384
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,990
<17-10,CASTLE>杀金·塔伯特的不是弗兰克
<17-10,CASTLE>Someone else killed Kim Tolbert.

385
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,710
<18-1,ALEXIS>是的  教授  我明白
<18-1,ALEXIS>Yes, professor, I understand.

386
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,350
<18-1,ALEXIS>好  再见
<18-1,ALEXIS>Okay. Bye.

387
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,230
<18-3,ALEXIS>-他说什么  -证据不充分
<18-3,ALEXIS>- What'd he say? - It's not enough.

388
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:21,270
<18-4,CASTLE>可我们知道了有其他人擦拭了门把手
<18-4,CASTLE>But we know someone else wiped down the doorknob.

390
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:23,410
<18-5,ALEXIS>对  可他说我们不能用
<18-5,ALEXIS>Yeah. But he says you can't build a case

391
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:25,160
<18-5,ALEXIS>不存在的证据来立案
<18-5,ALEXIS>based on evidence that isn't there.

392
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:28,460
<18-6,CASTLE>是贝克特
<18-6,CASTLE>It's Beckett.

393
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,270
<18-7,BECKETT>进展如何
<18-7,BECKETT>Hey. Hey, how's it going?

394
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:32,100
<18-8,CASTLE>不太理想
<18-8,CASTLE>I... not--not so good.

395
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,640
<18-8,CASTLE>我们现在什么线索都抓
<18-8,CASTLE>We'd be grasping at straws if we had any.

396
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,340
<18-9,BECKETT>我倒是有条线索给你
<18-9,BECKETT>Well, I might have one for you.

397
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:38,620
<18-9,BECKETT>我昨晚去了化验室
<18-9,BECKETT>I went to the trace lab last night.

398
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,810
<18-9,BECKETT>那里人说不会验你案子的证据
<18-9,BECKETT>Their people wouldn't run your case evidence,

399
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:42,630
<18-9,BECKETT>可我另外找了人做
<18-9,BECKETT>but I found someone else that would.

400
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:43,790
<18-10,CASTLE>谁
<18-10,CASTLE>Who?

401
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,240
<18-11,LANIE PARISH>我是蕾妮  开扬声器
<18-11,LANIE PARISH>It's Lanie. Put me on speaker.

402
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,770
<18-12,CASTLE>好  开了
<18-12,CASTLE>Yeah. Um... you're on.

<18-13,LANIE>Alexis, why on earth

404
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:53,930
<18-13,LANIE>偏不肯直接来找我呢
<18-13,LANIE>wouldn't you come to me directly?

405
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:56,120
<18-14,ALEXIS>-蕾妮  我不知道你能  -她说服
<18-14,ALEXIS>- Lanie, I didn't know you could do... - She convinced

406
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,230
<18-15,BECKETT>实验室的一个朋友在下班后查验证据
<18-15,BECKETT>a contact at the lab to run evidence after hours.

407
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,850
<18-16,LANIE>我们重新检检测了15年前
<18-16,LANIE>Now we re-tested every swab taken

408
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,020
<18-16,LANIE>金尸体上的每个棉签
<18-16,LANIE>from Kim's body 15 years ago.

409
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:06,270
<18-16,LANIE>宾州报告上列出的每样东西
<18-16,LANIE>Everything listed in Pennsylvania's report

00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,740
<18-16,LANIE>都出现在我们的报告上
<18-16,LANIE>came out in our report,

411
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,620
<18-16,LANIE>除了一样东西
<18-16,LANIE>with the exception of one thing.

412
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:12,080
<18-16,LANIE>我们发现了微量硝酸铵
<18-16,LANIE>We found trace amounts of ammonium nitrate

413
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,160
<18-16,LANIE>他们的实验室没发现
<18-16,LANIE>that their lab never picked up.

414
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,240
<18-17,ALEXIS>硝酸铵
<18-17,ALEXIS>Ammonium nitrate?

415

<18-19,ALEXIS>金的前男友  他以前在园艺商店工作
<18-19,ALEXIS>Kim's ex-boyfriend. He used to work at a gardening store.

421
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:30,980
<18-20,ALEXIS>老爸  是他  所以他才不愿和我们谈话
<18-20,ALEXIS>Dad, it's him. That's why he wouldn't speak with us.

422
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,940
<18-20,ALEXIS>-我们得找他谈谈  -等等
<18-20,ALEXIS>- We have to go talk to him. - Wait a minute.

423
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,470
<18-21,BECKETT>如果你们觉得其他人有嫌疑
<18-21,BECKETT>If you guys think someone out there is involved,

424
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,070
<18-21,BECKETT>那得去找警察
<18-21,BECKETT>then you need to get ahold of the police.

425
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:37,710
<18-22,CASTLE>嗯  我觉得警察不会
<18-22,CASTLE>Yeah, I don't think the police are gonna be

426
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:39,130
<18-22,CASTLE>提供什么帮助
<18-22,CASTLE>of much help around here.

427

<18-23,BECKETT>卡塞尔  如果他是凶手  就很危险
<18-23,BECKETT>Castle, if he's your killer, he's dangerous.

428
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:43,240
<18-23,BECKETT>出了状况我可帮不了你们
<18-23,BECKETT>I can't help you if something happens.

429

<18-24,CASTLE>听着  贝克特   弗兰克·汉森只有两天可活了
<18-24,CASTLE>Uh, look, Beckett, Frank Henson has two days to live.

430
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,850
<18-24,CASTLE>这是我们唯一的线索  我们还能怎么做
<18-24,CASTLE>This is our only lead. What else are we supposed to do?

431
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:56,540
<19-1,CASTLE>好了  现在的可能性是  莱尔·戈麦斯
<19-1,CASTLE>Okay. Now odds are, Lyle Gomez will not

432
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:57,810
<19-1,CASTLE>不愿意和我们谈
<19-1,CASTLE>want to speak with us,

433
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:00,660
<19-1,CASTLE>可是我有和这种人打交道的经验
<19-1,CASTLE>but I've got experience with guys like this,

434
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,080
<19-1,CASTLE>所以你交给我就行
<19-1,CASTLE>so you just leave it to me.

435
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,200
<19-2,ALEXIS>他出现了
<19-2,ALEXIS>Oh, there he is.

436
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:15,110
<19-3,CASTLE>好吧  出师不利
<19-3,CASTLE>All right, that does not bode well.

437
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:18,140
<19-4,CASTLE>你要去哪里
<19-4,CASTLE>Oh, oh, whoa. Where you think you're going?

<19-5,ALEXIS>-去找他谈  -阿丽克西斯  当然不行
<19-5,ALEXIS>- To talk to him. - Whoa. Alexis, no. Absolutely not.

439
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,750
<19-6,CASTLE>他的意图不能更明显了
<19-6,CASTLE>He just gave us a none-too-subtle hint.

440
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,570
<19-7,ALEXIS>他看着的是你  老爸  他不肯和你谈
<19-7,ALEXIS>He was looking at you, dad. He won't talk to you,

441
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:25,520
<19-7,ALEXIS>可我能和他沟通
<19-7,ALEXIS>but I can reach him.

442
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:27,700
<19-8,CASTLE>这人是个杀人嫌犯
<19-8,CASTLE>The man is a possible murder suspect.

443
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,130
<19-9,ALEXIS>他不想跟你有任何接触
<19-9,ALEXIS>He won't do anything with you here.

444
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,210
<19-10,CASTLE>你又凭什么认为
<19-10,CASTLE>But what makes you even think

445
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,330
<19-10,CASTLE>他会给你开门
<19-10,CASTLE>he's gonna open the door to you?

446
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:34,480
<19-11,ALEXIS>我是个年轻女孩  能让他想起金
<19-11,ALEXIS>I'm a teenage girl. I'll remind him of Kim.

447
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,360
<19-13,ALEXIS>-我才不会  -我没在征求你同意
<19-13,ALEXIS>- No, I'm not-- - I'm not asking for permission.

448
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:43,090
<19-14,CASTLE>我会牢牢盯住你的
<19-14,CASTLE>I'll be watching you like a hawk.

449
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:51,960
<19-15,LYLE GOMEZ>你们这些人  别再来打扰我了
<19-15,LYLE GOMEZ>You people need to stay off my property.

450
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,450
<19-16,ALEXIS>我想金看错你了
<19-16,ALEXIS>I guess Kim was wrong about you.

451
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:55,810
<19-17,LYLE>你什么意思
<19-17,LYLE>What do you mean?

452
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:57,060
<19-18,ALEXIS>我读了她的日记
<19-18,ALEXIS>I read her diary.

453
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:59,550
<19-18,ALEXIS>她说你和善  关心人
<19-18,ALEXIS>She said you were kind, caring,

454
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:00,850
<19-18,ALEXIS>让她觉得安全
<19-18,ALEXIS>made her feel safe.

455
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,430
<19-19,LYLE>她还说什么了
<19-19,LYLE>What else did she say?

456
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:07,060
<19-20,ALEXIS>不如你让我进去
<19-20,ALEXIS>How about you let me in?

457
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:21,340
<20-1,LYLE>这些年我没有一天不想念她
<20-1,LYLE>Not a day goes by I don't think about her.

458
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,660
<20-1,LYLE>你可知爱得越深  心就越疼
<20-1,LYLE>You ever been in love so bad, it hurt?

459
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,450
<20-2,ALEXIS>所以你绝口不提当年旧事
<20-2,ALEXIS>Is that why you don't talk about it?

460
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:31,680
<20-2,ALEXIS>案发时你在哪
<20-2,ALEXIS>Where were you when it happened?

461
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,470
<20-3,LYLE>那晚金打电话给我
<20-3,LYLE>Kim called me that night.

462
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:37,790
<20-3,LYLE>她让我到绿碧树林接她
<20-3,LYLE>She wanted me to pick her up from Jasper Grove.

463
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:39,240
<20-4,ALEXIS>绿碧树林  那是什么
<20-4,ALEXIS>Jasper Grove? What's that?

464
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:42,270
<20-5,LYLE>农场和树林  在城东  年轻人在那聚会
<20-5,LYLE>Farmland and woods, east of town. Kids party there.

465
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,790
<20-5,LYLE>她肯定参加了某个聚会  我也很惊讶
<20-5,LYLE>She must have gone to one, which surprised me

466
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:45,420
<20-5,LYLE>因为她几乎不喝酒
<20-5,LYLE>because she barely ever drank.

467
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,900
<20-6,ALEXIS>但是金和你分手了
<20-6,ALEXIS>But Kim broke up with you, right?

468
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,640
<20-6,ALEXIS>那为什么她要打给你
<20-6,ALEXIS>So why'd she call you?

469
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,820
<20-7,LYLE>她说我是她唯一信得过的人
<20-7,LYLE>She said I was the only one that she could trust.

470
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:54,600
<20-7,LYLE>-她很不安  -为什么
<20-7,LYLE>- She was upset. - About what?

471
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:58,130
<20-9,LYLE>她没说  我以为是有人挑逗了她
<20-9,LYLE>She didn't say. I figured somebody hit on her.

472
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:00,680
<20-9,LYLE>总之她让我开车接她回家  我就去了
<20-9,LYLE>Anyway, she asked me to drive her home, so I did.

473
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:01,930
<20-10,ALEXIS>之后呢
<20-10,ALEXIS>What happened then?

474
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:04,490
<20-11,LYLE>我满心希望她打给我
<20-11,LYLE>I was hoping that her calling meant

475
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:06,720
<20-11,LYLE>是想和我重燃旧情
<20-11,LYLE>that she'd give me another chance.

476
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:09,680
<20-11,LYLE>所以我问她
<20-11,LYLE>So I asked

477
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,550
<20-11,LYLE>-我能不能进去  -你进去了吗
<20-11,LYLE>- if I could come in. - And did you?

478
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,880
<20-12,ALEXIS>她想自己待会
<20-12,ALEXIS>She wanted to be alone.

479
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:16,350
<20-12,ALEXIS>她说有些事情她必须要做出抉择
<20-12,ALEXIS>She said she had some decisions she needed to make.

480
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:20,060
<20-13,LYLE>于是我决定去借酒浇愁
<20-13,LYLE>So I decided I needed to get drunk.

481
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,440
<20-13,LYLE>我从商店里偷了几罐啤酒
<20-13,LYLE>So I went and I shoplifted a pint of jack,

482
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,180
<20-13,LYLE>但是店主抓住了我
<20-13,LYLE>but the shop owner caught me.

483
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,010
<20-13,LYLE>他让我把他停车场里每一小片垃圾
<20-13,LYLE>He made me pick up every single piece of litter

484
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:29,070
<20-13,LYLE>都捡起来  以示惩戒
<20-13,LYLE>in his parking lot as punishment.

485
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:30,940
<20-13,LYLE>当我听见警笛的时候
<20-13,LYLE>When I heard the sirens,

486
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,480
<20-13,LYLE>我还以为店主报了警要抓我
<20-13,LYLE>I thought he was arresting me, too.

487
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,380
<20-13,LYLE>但那些警车是冲着金家去的
<20-13,LYLE>Those sirens were for Kim.

488
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:38,980
<20-13,LYLE>当我赶到她家时  我见到了弗兰克
<20-13,LYLE>When I got to her house, I saw Frank.

489
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,550
<20-13,LYLE>我在担架上看见了她的遗体
<20-13,LYLE>I saw her body on the stretcher.

490
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:45,580
<20-13,LYLE>如果我当初没离开她家去喝酒
<20-13,LYLE>If I had just found a way to stay there,

491
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,650
<20-13,LYLE>她就不会死了
<20-13,LYLE>she'd be alive.

492
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,910
<20-14,ALEXIS>这些你告诉警察了吗
<20-14,ALEXIS>Did you tell this to the police?

493
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:52,410
<20-15,LYLE>他们没问  为何要问  嫌犯已经抓到了
<20-15,LYLE>They didn't ask. Why would they? They had the guy.

494
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,690
<21-1,ALEXIS>为什么你认为弗兰克是凶手
<21-1,ALEXIS>Why do you think Frank killed her?

495
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,170
<21-2,LYLE>没准他嫉妒了
<21-2,LYLE>Maybe he got jealous.

496
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:08,490
<21-2,LYLE>他不喜欢见到她和其他人混在一起
<21-2,LYLE>He didn't like seeing her with other guys.

497
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:09,820
<21-3,ALEXIS>什么其他人
<21-3,ALEXIS>What other guys?

498
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:10,840
<21-4,LYLE>我没问
<21-4,LYLE>I didn't ask.

499
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,740
<21-4,LYLE>但我知道他们时常去她家
<21-4,LYLE>But I know they dropped by her house.

500
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,090
<21-4,LYLE>其他的那几个男生
<21-4,LYLE>Other boys.

501
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:16,900
<22-1,ALEXIS>多谢
<22-1,ALEXIS>Thanks.

502
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:21,440
<22-2,ALEXIS>爸爸  你这是干什么
<22-2,ALEXIS>Dad, what are you doing?!

503
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,000
<22-3,CASTLE>可能有点反应过度了
<22-3,CASTLE>I was overreacting, maybe.

504
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:25,230
<22-3,CASTLE>你在里面待了好久
<22-3,CASTLE>You were in there a long time.

505
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:26,620
<22-4,ALEXIS>我发现了一些线索
<22-4,ALEXIS>And I came away with some leads.

506
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,920
<22-4,ALEXIS>原来金还在和其他人约会
<22-4,ALEXIS>Turns out Kim was seeing other boys.

507
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:33,130
<23-1,FRANK>什么其他人
<23-1,FRANK>What other boys?

508
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,940
<23-2,CASTLE>我们还希望你能告诉我
<23-2,CASTLE>We were hoping you could tell us.

509
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,470
<23-3,ALEXIS>你家就在她家街对面
<23-3,ALEXIS>You lived across the street from her.

510
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:38,680
<23-3,ALEXIS>记不记得看见别的男生去金家
<23-3,ALEXIS>Do you remember seeing any other guys go to Kim's house?

511
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,330
<23-4,FRANK>-那是十五年前了  -这很重要  弗兰克
<23-4,FRANK>- That was 15 years ago. - This is important, Frank.

512
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:43,100
<23-5,ALEXIS>其中一个或许跟她被害有关
<23-5,ALEXIS>One of them may be involved in her death.

513
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,820
<23-6,FRANK>你们就只有这一条线索
<23-6,FRANK>That's the only lead you have?

514
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,350
<23-7,CASTLE>我们也在查那晚金参加的派对
<23-7,CASTLE>We're also looking into the party Kim went to that night.

515
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:49,010
<23-7,CASTLE>我们请纽约警局帮忙查找那晚
<23-7,CASTLE>We have N.Y.P.D. checking, seeing if

516
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:50,410
<23-7,CASTLE>绿碧树林附近有没有
<23-7,CASTLE>anything was reported in Jasper Grove

517
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,500
<23-7,CASTLE>和金被害有关的报警
<23-7,CASTLE>that could connect to her murder.

518
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,340
<23-8,ALEXIS>努力想想你看见去金家的那几个男生
<23-8,ALEXIS>Try to focus on kids you saw at Kim's house.

519
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:56,410
<23-8,ALEXIS>任何能记起来的细节  发色  开的汽车
<23-8,ALEXIS>Anything you can remember-- hair color, cars they drove,

520
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:59,290
<23-8,ALEXIS>骑的自行车  不光那一天的  哪天都行
<23-8,ALEXIS>bikes they rode. Not just that day. Any day.

521
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,330
<23-8,ALEXIS>再想想
<23-8,ALEXIS>Try to think.

522
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,300
<23-9,FRANK>我想累了
<23-9,FRANK>I'm tired of thinking.

523
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:07,340
<23-9,FRANK>实话跟你说  我实在撑不住了
<23-9,FRANK>I'm tired all around, to tell you the truth.

524
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:08,670
<23-10,ALEXIS>弗兰克
<23-10,ALEXIS>Frank.

525
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:11,030
<23-11,FRANK>结束了 阿丽克西斯
<23-11,FRANK>It's over, Alexis.

526
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,220
<23-12,ALEXIS>别这么说
<23-12,ALEXIS>Don't say that.

527
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,690
<23-12,ALEXIS>这些年来
<23-12,ALEXIS>All these years...

528
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:18,280
<23-13,FRANK>玛吉一直在打这个官司
<23-13,FRANK>Maggie has been leading this charge.

529
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,680
<23-13,FRANK>她一直支撑着我
<23-13,FRANK>She's been my rock,

530
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,680
<23-13,FRANK>现在我得回报她
<23-13,FRANK>and now I've gotta be hers.

531
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,870
<23-13,FRANK>我余下时日不足两天
<23-13,FRANK>I've got less than two days.

532
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:27,300
<23-13,FRANK>要想让她平静接受将要发生的事
<23-13,FRANK>To help her make peace with what's about to come,

533
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,600
<23-13,FRANK>最不需要的就是虚假的希望
<23-13,FRANK>the last thing that she needs is more false hope.

534
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,450
<23-15,FRANK>-这不是虚假希望  -这就是  结束了
<23-15,FRANK>- This isn't false hope. - It is false hope. It's done.

535
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:32,360
<23-16,ALEXIS>也许这能扭转整个案情
<23-16,ALEXIS>This could be what turns everything around!

536
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,950
<23-17,FRANK>结束了  阿丽克西斯
<23-17,FRANK>It's done. Alexis...

537
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:38,930
<23-18,FRANK>狱警
<23-18,FRANK>Guard.

538
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,270
<23-19,FRANK>对于你的所有努力和尝试
<23-19,FRANK>Listen, I appreciate everything you've done,

539
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,800
<23-19,FRANK>我十分感激
<23-19,FRANK>everything you've tried to do.

540
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:47,940
<23-19,FRANK>但是时候放手了
<23-19,FRANK>But it's time to let it go.

541
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:03,740
<24-1,ALEXIS>爸爸  我们马上就要找到突破口
<24-1,ALEXIS>Dad, we might be on to something.

542
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,190
<24-1,ALEXIS>弗兰克怎么能放弃
<24-1,ALEXIS>How can Frank just give up?

543
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:07,960
<24-2,CASTLE>他经历得太多了  这也怨不得他
<24-2,CASTLE>After what he's been through, I can't blame him.

544
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:09,020
<24-3,ALEXIS>所以你也要放弃了
<24-3,ALEXIS>So you're giving up, too.

545
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:12,450
<24-4,CASTLE>我们会追查每一条可能的线索
<24-4,CASTLE>Hey, we are gonna follow every possible lead, but...

546
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:13,560
<24-4,CASTLE>但不能再去找弗兰克了
<24-4,CASTLE>we can't go back to Frank,

547
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,040
<24-4,CASTLE>除非能查出证明他无辜的可靠证据
<24-4,CASTLE>not until we have solid evidence that he's innocent.

548
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:16,910
<24-5,RYAN>卡塞尔
<24-5,RYAN>Hey, Castle.

549
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:19,690
<24-6,CASTLE>莱恩  关于绿碧森林你查到什么了吗
<24-6,CASTLE>Hey, Ryan, did you come up with anything on Jasper Grove?

550
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:20,960
<24-7,RYAN>金·塔伯特被害那晚
<24-7,RYAN>No police or incident reports

551
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,580
<24-7,RYAN>没人报警
<24-7,RYAN>from the night that Kim Tolbert died.

552
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:25,870
<24-7,RYAN>不过  我倒是发现绿碧森林那边有问题
<24-7,RYAN>However, I did find definite signs of trouble in Jasper Grove.

553
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:27,620
<24-8,ALEXIS>什么问题
<24-8,ALEXIS>What kind of trouble?

554
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:29,170
<24-9,RYAN>1997年那里的一间农房被没收抵债
<24-9,RYAN>A farmhouse there was foreclosed on

555
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:31,780
<24-9,RYAN>一直闲置到1999年
<24-9,RYAN>in '97, stood empty till '99.

556
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:33,370
<24-9,RYAN>那年一家年轻住户买下了农房
<24-9,RYAN>That's when a young family bought it,

557
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:34,990
<24-9,RYAN>但他们一入住  就全都得了病
<24-9,RYAN>but as soon as they moved in, they all got sick.

558
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:38,120
<24-9,RYAN>原因是那地方被有毒化学品污染了
<24-9,RYAN>Turns out the place was contaminated with toxic chemicals.

559
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:38,960
<24-10,CASTLE>什么化学品
<24-10,CASTLE>From what?

560
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,000
<24-11,RYAN>麻黄碱制品的高浓度残留
<24-11,RYAN>Uh, high levels of residue from methamphetamine production,

561
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,880
<24-11,RYAN>也许这能解释你们查到的硝酸铵残留
<24-11,RYAN>which might explain your ammonium nitrate.

562
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,030
<24-12,CASTLE>有人用那间农房制冰毒
<24-12,CASTLE>Someone was using the farmhouse to cook meth?

563
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:48,460
<24-13,RYAN>没错  而且这些人可能是一帮小年轻
<24-13,RYAN>Yeah, and it looks like it might have been kids.

564
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,890
<24-14,ALEXIS>为何这么说
<24-14,ALEXIS>What makes you say that?

565
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,750
<24-15,RYAN>郡技术员拍下的照片
<24-15,RYAN>Photos from the county assessor's office

566
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:54,810
<24-15,RYAN>显示那里的地面上满是自行车的轮胎印
<24-15,RYAN>show bicycle tracks in the dirt all over the property.

567
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:57,830
<24-16,CASTLE>非常感谢你  莱恩
<24-16,CASTLE>Thank you very much, Ryan.

568
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:59,250
<24-17,ALEXIS>自行车轮胎印
<24-17,ALEXIS>Bike tracks.

569
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:00,640
<24-17,ALEXIS>金家外也有自行车印
<24-17,ALEXIS>There were bike tracks outside Kim's house.

570
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,860
<24-17,ALEXIS>爸爸  你知道这意味着什么吗
<24-17,ALEXIS>Dad, do you realize what this means?

571
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:04,090
<24-18,CASTLE>意味着那晚金参加的派对就在那农房
<24-18,CASTLE>That maybe the party Kim went to was at that farmhouse

572
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:05,410
<24-18,CASTLE>而她看见有人在吸毒
<24-18,CASTLE>and she saw kids doing meth.

573
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:07,260
<24-19,ALEXIS>不光吸毒  还制毒
<24-19,ALEXIS>Well, not just doing meth. Cooking meth.

574
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,480
<24-20,CASTLE>所以她必须离开那里
<24-20,CASTLE>That's why she had to get out of there.

575
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,560
<24-20,CASTLE>所以她告诉莱尔她必须要作抉择
<24-20,CASTLE>That's why she told Lyle she had some decisions to make.

576
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,860
<24-21,ALEXIS>她在考虑告发他们
<24-21,ALEXIS>She was thinking about turning them in.

577
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,480
<24-21,ALEXIS>那么有可能在她离开聚会之后
<24-21,ALEXIS>So maybe when she left the party...

578
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,240
<24-22,CASTLE>某个参与制毒的人
<24-22,CASTLE>One of our teenage meth cookers

579
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,640
<24-22,CASTLE>担心她会报警
<24-22,CASTLE>got worried she'd go to the cops.

580
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,550
<24-23,ALEXIS>-然后他就跟踪她  -骑着自行车
<24-23,ALEXIS>- So he went after her. - On his bike.

581
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:19,880
<24-25,ALEXIS>她房前的车胎印
<24-25,ALEXIS>The tire tracks at her house--

582
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,070
<24-26,CASTLE>他知道她住在哪  因为他去过
<24-26,CASTLE>He knew where she lived because he'd been there before.

583
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:24,430
<24-27,ALEXIS>他是跟金约会的男孩中的其中一个
<24-27,ALEXIS>He was one of the other guys Kim was seeing.

584
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,550
<24-28,CASTLE_ALEXIS>我们得跟金的母亲谈谈
<24-28,CASTLE_ALEXIS>We need to talk to Kim's mother.

585
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,600
<24-29,CASTLE>好奇怪
<24-29,CASTLE>Now that was weird.

586
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:32,080
<24-29,CASTLE>异口同声是我和贝克特的专利
<24-29,CASTLE>Usually I do that with Beckett.

587
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:40,160
<25-1,LANIE>你来这做什么
<25-1,LANIE>Hey, what are you doing here?

588
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,890
<25-2,BECKETT>我
<25-2,BECKETT>Hey. I, um...

589
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,590
<25-2,BECKETT>只是想谢谢你对卡塞尔和
<25-2,BECKETT>just wanted to... thank you for all of your help

590
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:47,280
<25-2,BECKETT>阿丽克西斯的帮助
<25-2,BECKETT>with Castle and Alexis.

591
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,670
<25-3,LANIE>这事打个电话不就得了
<25-3,LANIE>Seemed like you could have done that over the phone.

592
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,930
<25-3,LANIE>跟我说说吧  闺蜜
<25-3,LANIE>All right. Talk to me, girlfriend.

593
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:54,370
<25-3,LANIE>告诉我你在纠结什么
<25-3,LANIE>Tell me what's on your mind.

594
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:58,250
<25-4,BECKETT>你觉得奇怪吗  这案子
<25-4,BECKETT>Do you find it odd that alexis has gone

595
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:00,400
<25-4,BECKETT>阿丽克西斯找了所有人帮忙  就是没找我
<25-4,BECKETT>to everyone but me on this case?

596
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,920
<25-5,LANIE>她也没去找帕穆特
<25-5,LANIE>She hasn't gone to Perlmutter yet.

597
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,490
<25-6,BECKETT>只要能不去没人愿意去的
<25-6,BECKETT>Yeah, well, no one does if they can help it.

598
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,480
<25-7,LANIE>你不能把这当成是针对你的
<25-7,LANIE>Well, you can't take it personally.

599
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:08,300
<25-7,LANIE>我知道  只是
<25-7,LANIE>No, I know. It's just...

600
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,110
<25-8,BECKETT>卡塞尔和我就要结婚了
<25-8,BECKETT>Castle and I are about to become a family,

601
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:15,630
<25-8,BECKETT>这本身就够不可思议了  然后
<25-8,BECKETT>which is weird enough as it is, and...

602
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:17,720
<25-8,BECKETT>他跟阿丽克西斯一起生活了很久
<25-8,BECKETT>He and Alexis have this whole history

603
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,780
<25-8,BECKETT>而那段生活我从未参与其中
<25-8,BECKETT>that has nothing to do with me,

604
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:22,250
<25-8,BECKETT>每当他俩之间有什么事情
<25-8,BECKETT>And it kind of feels like when it comes to the two of them,

605
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,880
<25-8,BECKETT>我总感觉像个局外人
<25-8,BECKETT>I'm always gonna be on the outside.

606
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,330
<25-9,LANIE>家家有本难念的经
<25-9,LANIE>Perfect families don't exist.

607
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,900
<25-9,LANIE>这就要看你能否
<25-9,LANIE>It's gonna be up to you

608
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:33,980
<25-9,LANIE>找到一个切入点  融入他们
<25-9,LANIE>to find a way to make your baggage match their baggage.

609
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:36,610
<25-9,LANIE>要靠你自己来开始你们共同的生活
<25-9,LANIE>It's up to you to make your own history.

610
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:45,770
<26-1,CASTLE>塔伯特夫人  很抱歉上门打扰
<26-1,CASTLE>Mrs. Tolbert, we're very sorry to intrude.

611
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:47,150
<26-2,PATRICE TOLBERT>你挺有胆量的
<26-2,PATRICE TOLBERT>You have some nerve.

612
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:49,310
<26-2,PATRICE TOLBERT>我知道你是谁  知道你想做什么
<26-2,PATRICE TOLBERT>I know who you are, what you're trying to do.

613
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:51,090
<26-3,CASTLE>听着  不管关于我们你听说了什么
<26-3,CASTLE>Look, whatever you may have heard about us,

614
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:53,220
<26-3,CASTLE>我们不是来跟你说弗兰克无辜的
<26-3,CASTLE>We are not here to tell you that Frank henson is innocent.

615
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,880
<26-4,ALEXIS>我们只是想来问几个问题
<26-4,ALEXIS>We'd just like to ask you some questions.

616
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,690
<26-5,CASTLE>除了你没人能回答的问题
<26-5,CASTLE>Questions no one else can answer.

617
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:58,430
<26-5,CASTLE>不然我们不会来打扰你的
<26-5,CASTLE>Otherwise, we would not bother you.

618
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:00,410
<26-6,PATRICE>什么问题
<26-6,PATRICE>What questions?

619
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:03,620
<26-7,ALEXIS>金和她在约会的其他男孩有过矛盾吗
<26-7,ALEXIS>Did Kim have problems with any of the other guys she was seeing?

620
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:06,290
<26-8,PATRICE>没别人了  就莱尔
<26-8,PATRICE>There was no one else. Just Lyle.

621
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:08,310
<26-8,PATRICE>而且刚和他分手
<26-8,PATRICE>And she'd just broken off with him.

622
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:08,900
<26-9,ALEXIS>只是
<26-9,ALEXIS>Well, it's just that

623
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,700
<26-9,ALEXIS>我们听说有其他男孩去过她家
<26-9,ALEXIS>We had heard that some other boys had stopped by the house.

624
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:15,360
<26-10,PATRICE>其他男孩  是的  她是名家教
<26-10,PATRICE>Some boys? Yeah, she was a tutor.

625
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:17,130
<26-10,PATRICE>一些学生觉得需要家教面子上过不去
<26-10,PATRICE>Some of her students were embarrassed

626
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:19,450
<26-10,PATRICE>她便悄悄地帮助他们
<26-10,PATRICE>that they needed help, so she kept things quiet.

627
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:21,420
<26-10,PATRICE>她就是这样一个好人
<26-10,PATRICE>That's who she was.

628
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:23,710
<26-11,CASTLE>你还记得那些学生的名字吗
<26-11,CASTLE>Do you remember these students' names?

629
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:26,470
<26-12,PATRICE>我才不会让你把这事扯到他们身上去
<26-12,PATRICE>I'm not about to let you hang this on one of them.

630
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:29,190
<26-13,CASTLE>-你们该走了  -多谢抽空
<26-13,CASTLE>- Now you need to leave. - Thank you for your time.

631
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:31,080
<26-14,ALEXIS>女士  再多问一个问题
<26-14,ALEXIS>Oh, oh, madam, just one more question.

632
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,980
<26-14,ALEXIS>金是哪科的家教
<26-14,ALEXIS>What subject did Kim tutor?

633
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:34,780
<26-15,PATRICE>化学
<26-15,PATRICE>Chemistry.

634
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:41,340
<26-16,ALEXIS>-爸  -我知道  金是化学家教
<26-16,ALEXIS>- Dad... - I know. Kim tutored chemistry.

635
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:43,620
<26-17,CASTLE>如果她的一个学生骗她
<26-17,CASTLE>So what if one of her students tricked her

636
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,260
<26-17,CASTLE>帮他学习如何制造病冰毒
<26-17,CASTLE>into helping him learn how to cook meth?

637
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:46,920
<26-17,CASTLE>当她发现了他的真正目的后
<26-17,CASTLE>And when she figured out what he was doing,

638
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:47,970
<26-17,CASTLE>她被灭口了
<26-17,CASTLE>he killed her.

639
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:49,600
<26-18,ALEXIS>还有其他发现
<26-18,ALEXIS>No, there's something else.

640
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,520
<26-19,ALEXIS>当塔伯特夫人说出"化学"时
<26-19,ALEXIS>As soon as mrs. Tolbert said "Chemistry,"

641
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:53,330
<26-19,ALEXIS>我想起来了
<26-19,ALEXIS>I remembered.

642
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,200
<26-19,ALEXIS>看这个
<26-19,ALEXIS>Look at this.

643
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:57,680
<26-19,ALEXIS>犯罪现场发现了两本化学课本
<26-19,ALEXIS>Two identical chemistry books were found at the scene of the crime.

644
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,500
<26-20,CASTLE>那么其中一本可能就是她学生的
<26-20,CASTLE>So maybe the other one belonged to one of her students.

645
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,350
<26-21,ALEXIS>没错  但这种课本是很贵的
<26-21,ALEXIS>Right, but a textbook like this is expensive.

646
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,770
<26-21,ALEXIS>如果你弄丢了  你得付罚款
<26-21,ALEXIS>If you lost one, you'd have to pay a fine.

647
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:03,840
<26-21,ALEXIS>你会想把它找回来
<26-21,ALEXIS>You'd want it back.

648
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,670
<26-22,CASTLE>除非它会把你与一场谋杀案联系起来
<26-22,CASTLE>Unless it would implicate you in a murder.

649
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:07,090
<26-23,ALEXIS>爸  如果我们找到这本书是谁的
<26-23,ALEXIS>Dad, if we figure out whose book this is,

650
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:08,450
<26-23,ALEXIS>我们可能就找到了凶手
<26-23,ALEXIS>We might find our killer.

651
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:09,660
<26-24,CASTLE>不知道这有没有可能
<26-24,CASTLE>I don't know if that's possible.

652
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:11,270
<26-24,CASTLE>我是说  毕竟这些书都是十五年前的了
<26-24,CASTLE>I mean, these books are over 15 years old.

653
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:12,490
<26-25,ALEXIS>值得一试
<26-25,ALEXIS>It's worth a shot.

654
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:14,870
<27-1,BETTY>实际上  有些书都不止20年了
<27-1,BETTY>Actually, some of them are over 20 years old.

655
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:17,680
<27-1,BETTY>但由于预算削减  我们还在用它们
<27-1,BETTY>But because of budget cuts, we still use them.

656
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,530
<27-2,ALEXIS>你能找到1998年的记录吗
<27-2,ALEXIS>Can you pull up records all the way back to 1998?

657
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:22,880
<27-3,BETTY>就算我能  我大概也不应该
<27-3,BETTY>Well, even if I can, I probably shouldn't.

658
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:24,460
<27-4,CASTLE>也许
<27-4,CASTLE>Uh... perhaps

659
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:28,060
<27-4,CASTLE>该给贵校购置新教材了
<27-4,CASTLE>a generous donation for new textbooks is in order.

660
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:30,100
<27-5,BETTY>我想我能通融一下
<27-5,BETTY>I suppose I could bend the rules.

661
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,830
<27-6,ALEXIS>这是两本书的条形码
<27-6,ALEXIS>These are the barcodes from each book.

662
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:35,540
<27-7,BETTY>请填"现金"
<27-7,BETTY>Make it out to "Cash."

663
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:43,990
<27-8,BETTY>在哪呢  让我看看
<27-8,BETTY>Where are ya? Oh, let's see...

664
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:46,560
<27-8,BETTY>两本书在系统中都有记录
<27-8,BETTY>Both of them are actually still in our system.

665
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:49,770
<27-8,BETTY>1998年9月8号借出
<27-8,BETTY>Loaned out september 8th, 1998.

666
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:51,160
<27-8,BETTY>两本都没还回来
<27-8,BETTY>Neither was ever returned.

667
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,470
<27-9,ALEXIS>你能查到是谁借的这两本书吗
<27-9,ALEXIS>Any way you can figure out who they belonged to?

668
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,820
<27-10,BETTY>一本是金·塔伯特借的
<27-10,BETTY>Mm. One was Kim Tolbert's--

669
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:59,270
<27-10,BETTY>那个遇害的可怜女孩
<27-10,BETTY>the poor girl who died.

670
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:00,500
<27-11,CASTLE>另一本呢
<27-11,CASTLE>And the other one?

671
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:04,070
<27-12,BETTY>借书人叫约翰·汉森
<27-12,BETTY>Uh, looks like it belonged to one John Henson.

672
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:05,740
<27-13,ALEXIS>天啊
<27-13,ALEXIS>Oh, my god.

673
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:07,170
<27-14,CASTLE>那是弗兰克的弟弟
<27-14,CASTLE>That's Frank's younger brother.

674
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:12,850
<28-1,CASTLE>这本化学书证明约翰到过金家
<28-1,CASTLE>The chemistry book puts John in Kim's house,

675
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:14,120
<28-1,CASTLE>但我们还需要更多证据
<28-1,CASTLE>but we're gonna need a lot more than that

676
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,290
<28-1,CASTLE>才能证明他就是凶手
<28-1,CASTLE>to prove he's our killer.

677
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:17,190
<28-2,ALEXIS>这些资料都是关于弗兰克的
<28-2,ALEXIS>These files are all on Frank.

678
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:19,320
<28-2,ALEXIS>跟约翰有关的不多
<28-2,ALEXIS>There's not a lot here on John.

679
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:22,640
<28-2,ALEXIS>还要多久莱恩才能完成背景调查
<28-2,ALEXIS>How long until Ryan finishes his background check?

680
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,830
<28-3,CASTLE>差不多该弄好了
<28-3,CASTLE>He should be calling any minute.

681
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:25,060
<28-3,CASTLE>你找到什么能把约翰和
<28-3,CASTLE>Have you managed to find anything

682
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:26,860
<28-3,CASTLE>谋杀案连起来的了吗
<28-3,CASTLE>that might link John to the murder.

683
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:28,330
<28-4,ALEXIS>没  不过我确实发现了些
<28-4,ALEXIS>No, but I did find something

684
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:30,160
<28-4,ALEXIS>能把约翰和金连起来的事
<28-4,ALEXIS>that links John to Kim.

685
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:32,110
<28-4,ALEXIS>根据事故报告
<28-4,ALEXIS>According to this accident report,

686
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:35,640
<28-4,ALEXIS>97年弗兰克因超速卷入了一场车祸
<28-4,ALEXIS>Frank was speeding and got in a car crash in '97.

687
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,750
<28-4,ALEXIS>约翰当时和他在一起
<28-4,ALEXIS>John was with him.

688
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,450
<28-4,ALEXIS>他伤得挺重的
<28-4,ALEXIS>He was hurt pretty badly.

689
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:39,940
<28-4,ALEXIS>落下了很多课
<28-4,ALEXIS>He had to miss a lot of school.

690
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:41,960
<28-4,ALEXIS>他那学期正在修化学
<28-4,ALEXIS>He was taking chemistry that semester,

691
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,240
<28-4,ALEXIS>可能因此他需要金做家庭辅导
<28-4,ALEXIS>which is probably why he needed tutoring from Kim.

692
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,250
<28-5,CASTLE>一定是莱恩
<28-5,CASTLE>That'll be Ryan.

693
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:49,930
<28-5,CASTLE>"约翰·汉森  无不良记录
<28-5,CASTLE>"John Henson. Clean record.

694
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:52,280
<28-5,CASTLE>未曾定罪  未曾被捕"  等下
<28-5,CASTLE>No convictions, no arrests." Whoa, wait.

695
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:55,560
<28-5,CASTLE>98年被捕一次  金被杀三个月前
<28-5,CASTLE>One arrest in '98, 3 months before Kim was killed,

696
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,510
<28-5,CASTLE>因持有管制品
<28-5,CASTLE>for possession of a controlled substance.

697
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:58,550
<28-6,ALEXIS>冰毒吗
<28-6,ALEXIS>Meth?

698
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:01,080
<28-7,CASTLE>没说明  起诉被撤销了
<28-7,CASTLE>Doesn't say, and the charges were dropped,

699
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:03,770
<28-7,CASTLE>但这说明约翰搞过毒品
<28-7,CASTLE>but this establishes John was involved in drugs.

700
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:06,460
<28-8,ALEXIS>如果金向警方举报他制作冰毒
<28-8,ALEXIS>And if Kim had gone to the police saying he was a meth cooker,

701
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:08,470
<28-8,ALEXIS>他就不会受点小惩罚  蒙混过去
<28-8,ALEXIS>He wouldn't have gotten off with a slap on the wrist.

702
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:09,840
<28-9,CASTLE>这就是杀人动机
<28-9,CASTLE>That's motive for murder.

703
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,230
<28-10,ALEXIS>我们得跟约翰谈谈
<28-10,ALEXIS>We need to talk to John.

704
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,220
<28-11,CASTLE>根据这份材料  他住在曼哈顿
<28-11,CASTLE>According to this, he lives in Manhattan.

705
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,580
<29-1,BECKETT>感谢你能来  汉森先生
<29-1,BECKETT>Thank you for coming in, Mr. Henson.

706
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:18,870
<29-2,JOHN>只要能帮到弗兰克
<29-2,JOHN>Anything for Frank.

707
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:21,520
<29-2,JOHN>当然  这事上  他需要奇迹
<29-2,JOHN>Of course, at this point, he needs a miracle.

708
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,470
<29-2,JOHN>我一直都力挺我哥哥
<29-2,JOHN>I've always supported my brother.

709
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,670
<29-2,JOHN>从没想过他会伤害金
<29-2,JOHN>I never wanted to think he could have hurt Kim,

710
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,570
<29-2,JOHN>但如果是别人干的
<29-2,JOHN>but if someone else did this,

711
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:29,160
<29-2,JOHN>怎么会到现在还没发现呢
<29-2,JOHN>why haven't they been found by now?

712
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,250
<29-3,BECKETT>也许所有人都找错了方向
<29-3,BECKETT>Well, maybe no one was looking in the right place.

713
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:33,120
<29-3,BECKETT>你跟金熟吗
<29-3,BECKETT>Now how well did you know Kim?

714
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,590
<29-4,JOHN>我在学校每天都能见到她
<29-4,JOHN>Well, I saw her every day at school.

715
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,410
<29-5,BECKETT>其他地方呢  下课之后
<29-5,BECKETT>Anywhere else? Outside of class?

716
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:39,410
<29-6,JOHN>她家  有时候  她给我做家教
<29-6,JOHN>Her house, sometimes. She tutored me.

717
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:42,060
<29-7,BECKETT>她遇害那天你在她家吗
<29-7,BECKETT>And were you at her house the day that she died?

718
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,830
<29-8,JOHN>没有  为什么这么问
<29-8,JOHN>No. Why?

719
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:44,930
<29-9,BECKETT>我们只是想知道
<29-9,BECKETT>We were just wondering

720
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:47,480
<29-9,BECKETT>你的化学课本怎么会在她家出现
<29-9,BECKETT>what your chemistry book was doing at her house.

721
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:51,960
<29-10,JOHN>我肯定是把它落在那了  忘了
<29-10,JOHN>Well, I must have left it there... or forgot it.

722
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,220
<29-11,BECKETT>而你从未想过要回来
<29-11,BECKETT>And you never asked for it back?

723
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:56,070
<29-11,BECKETT>金在学期期中遇害
<29-11,BECKETT>I mean, Kim was killed somewhere in the middle of your school term.

724
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,060
<29-11,BECKETT>你怎么会不需要那本书呢
<29-11,BECKETT>Wouldn't you have needed it?

725
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,440
<29-12,JOHN>我也许买了本新的
<29-12,JOHN>Well, I might have bought a new one.

726
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,190
<29-12,JOHN>那是很久以前的事了
<29-12,JOHN>It was a long time ago.

727
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:01,320
<29-12,JOHN>我都记不得了
<29-12,JOHN>I don't really remember.

728
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,620
<29-12,JOHN>有什么关系吗
<29-12,JOHN>Why does that matter?

729
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,450
<29-13,BECKETT>可能没什么关系
<29-13,BECKETT>You know, it probably doesn't.

730
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:06,480
<29-13,BECKETT>根据你的陈述
<29-13,BECKETT>Now in your statement,

731
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,110
<29-13,BECKETT>你说你在金被杀时待在自己的房间
<29-13,BECKETT>You said you were in your room at the time of Kim's murder,

732
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:11,000
<29-13,BECKETT>但你没有听到她的尖叫声
<29-13,BECKETT>but you didn't hear her scream.

733
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:11,830
<29-14,JOHN>是的
<29-14,JOHN>That's right.

734
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:15,460
<29-15,BECKETT>当晚你有没有听到其他不寻常的声音
<29-15,BECKETT>Did you hear any other unusual sounds that night?

735
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:17,750
<29-16,JOHN>想不起来了
<29-16,JOHN>Uh, not that I can think of.

736
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,510
<29-17,BECKETT>烟雾报警器的声音呢
<29-17,BECKETT>What about the smoke alarm?

737
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:21,580
<29-18,JOHN>不  我听到了
<29-18,JOHN>Yeah, no, I did hear that.

738
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:24,330
<29-19,BECKETT>弗兰克的审讯证词中
<29-19,BECKETT>In Frank's trial testimony,

739
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:26,240
<29-19,BECKETT>他没提到你去了车库
<29-19,BECKETT>he never mentioned you coming down to the garage,

740
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,410
<29-19,BECKETT>所以你在警报响起的时候一直待在房间里
<29-19,BECKETT>so you were in your room the whole time the alarm was going off?

741
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:31,250
<29-20,JOHN>是的
<29-20,JOHN>Yes, I was.

742
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,740
<29-21,BECKETT>我觉得这很奇怪  汉森先生
<29-21,BECKETT>Now I find that odd, Mr. Henson,

743
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:37,520
<29-21,BECKETT>因为安保公司记录显示警报持续了
<29-21,BECKETT>because the security company logs show the alarm sounded

744
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,400
<29-21,BECKETT>整整2分47秒
<29-21,BECKETT>for a full two minutes and 47 seconds,

745
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,270
<29-21,BECKETT>但你却一直待在房间里
<29-21,BECKETT>but you stayed in your room that whole time.

746
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:44,180
<29-21,BECKETT>没走出来查看一下
<29-21,BECKETT>Never got up to check and make sure

747
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:46,010
<29-21,BECKETT>屋子有没有烧着吗
<29-21,BECKETT>that the house wasn't burning down?

748
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:50,900
<29-22,BECKETT>你其实没有听到警报声吧
<29-22,BECKETT>You never heard the alarm going off, did you?

749
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:52,390
<29-22,BECKETT>因为你不在自己家里
<29-22,BECKETT>Because you weren't in your house.

750
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:53,510
<29-23,JOHN>你在说什么
<29-23,JOHN>What are you saying?

751
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:55,260
<29-23,JOHN>是我杀了金  都是我做的吗
<29-23,JOHN>That I killed Kim, that I did it?

752
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,580
<29-24,BECKETT>你那天晚上在哪里
<29-24,BECKETT>Where were you that night?

753
00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:00,290
<29-25,JOHN>我不会再回答你的任何问题
<29-25,JOHN>I'm not answering any more of your questions.

754
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:12,290
<30-1,FRANK>怎么回事  我以为一切都结束了
<30-1,FRANK>What is this, guys? I thought we were done.

755
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:15,720
<30-2,CASTLE>汉森先生  我们找到了一些新证据
<30-2,CASTLE>Mr. Henson, we've, uh, uncovered some new evidence--

756
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:19,720
<30-2,CASTLE>证据显示杀害金·塔伯特的另有其人
<30-2,CASTLE>evidence that suggests someone else killed Kim Tolbert.

757
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:21,410
<30-3,MAGGIE>谁
<30-3,MAGGIE>Who?

758
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:24,250
<30-4,ALEXIS>弗兰克  说出来可能不太容易接受
<30-4,ALEXIS>Frank, I know this is going to be hard to hear,

759
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:26,360
<30-4,ALEXIS>我们认为凶手可能是约翰
<30-4,ALEXIS>but we think it could be John.

760
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,170
<30-5,MAGGIE>不  约翰
<30-5,MAGGIE>No. John?

761
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:29,630
<30-5,MAGGIE>为什么这么说
<30-5,MAGGIE>Based on what?

762
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:32,270
<30-6,CASTLE>他的化学书留在犯罪现场
<30-6,CASTLE>His chemistry book was found at the crime scene.

763
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,230
<30-6,CASTLE>金死时他的不在场证明不成立
<30-6,CASTLE>His alibi for where he was when Kim died is falling apart.

764
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:36,720
<30-7,FRANK>你们他妈的是怎么回事
<30-7,FRANK>What the hell is wrong with you?

765
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:39,240
<30-7,FRANK>我说了让你们别管了
<30-7,FRANK>I told you to drop it.

766
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,330
<30-8,ALEXIS>这是什么意思
<30-8,ALEXIS>What do you mean?

767
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:41,670
<30-8,ALEXIS>弗兰克  我们真的查到东西了
<30-8,ALEXIS>Frank, we're really on to something.

768
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:42,990
<30-9,FRANK>我说了别查了
<30-9,FRANK>And I'm saying get off it.

769
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,830
<30-9,FRANK>你们别把约翰扯进来
<30-9,FRANK>You leave John out of this.

770
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:46,340
<30-10,MAGGIE>亲爱的  你怎么了
<30-10,MAGGIE>Honey, what's wrong with you?

771
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:47,650
<30-10,MAGGIE>如果是约翰做的
<30-10,MAGGIE>If John did this--

772
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:48,720
<30-11,CASTLE>他知道
<30-11,CASTLE>He knows.

773
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:51,410
<30-11,CASTLE>他知道是约翰做的
<30-11,CASTLE>He knows it was john.

774
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:59,200
<30-12,MAGGIE>弗兰克  是真的吗
<30-12,MAGGIE>Frank? Is this true?

775
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:02,310
<30-13,MAGGIE>你从头到尾都知道
<30-13,MAGGIE>You knew this whole time?

776
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,290
<30-13,MAGGIE>为什么要这么做
<30-13,MAGGIE>Why would you do this?

777
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:07,650
<30-13,MAGGIE>为什么要放弃自己的生命
<30-13,MAGGIE>Why would you throw your life away?

778
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:09,600
<30-14,FRANK>因为我放弃了他
<30-14,FRANK>Because I threw his away.

779
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:10,650
<30-14,FRANK>好吗
<30-14,FRANK>Okay?

780
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,110
<30-14,FRANK>他杀她是因我而起
<30-14,FRANK>I'm the reason why he killed her.

781
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:16,180
<30-15,MAGGIE>不  弗兰克  不论约翰做了什么  都不是你的错
<30-15,MAGGIE>No. Frank, whatever John did, it can't be your fault.

782
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:18,130
<30-16,FRANK>还记得我跟你说的那辆科迈罗吗
<30-16,FRANK>You remember that Camaro I was telling you about?

783
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:19,460
<30-16,FRANK>是我开的车
<30-16,FRANK>I rolled that car...

784
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:21,690
<30-16,FRANK>小强坐在里面
<30-16,FRANK>with Johnny in it.

785
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:23,010
<30-16,FRANK>我毫发无损
<30-16,FRANK>I walked away...

786
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,230
<30-16,FRANK>但他没有
<30-16,FRANK>But he didn't.

787
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:29,190
<30-16,FRANK>头部受伤后  他有一阵子没恢复过来
<30-16,FRANK>After the head injury, he wasn't right for a while.

788
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:30,810
<30-16,FRANK>他开始嗑药
<30-16,FRANK>He started taking drugs.

789
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:32,300
<30-16,FRANK>有了暴力倾向
<30-16,FRANK>He got violent.

790
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,320
<30-16,FRANK>他那段时间失忆了
<30-16,FRANK>He'd have these memory lapses.

791
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,720
<30-16,FRANK>不记得自己做了什么
<30-16,FRANK>He wouldn't remember what he did.

792
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:37,850
<30-16,FRANK>弗兰克
<30-16,FRANK>Frank.

793
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,150
<30-17,CASTLE>当晚究竟发生了什么
<30-17,CASTLE>What really happened that night?

794
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,970
<30-18,FRANK>我最担心的噩梦变成了现实
<30-18,FRANK>My worst nightmare came true.

795
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,450
<30-18,FRANK>现在好了
<30-18,FRANK>It's off now.

796
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,440
<30-18,FRANK>谢谢
<30-18,FRANK>Thank you.

797
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:00,770
<30-18,FRANK>天呐
<30-18,FRANK>Oh, my god.

798
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:02,580
<32-1,FRANK>你做了什么  约翰
<32-1,FRANK>What'd you do, John?

799
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:03,690
<32-1,FRANK>你做了什么
<32-1,FRANK>What'd you do?!

800
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,700
<32-2,FRANK>你得马上离开这里
<32-2,FRANK>You gotta get out of here.

801
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:09,690
<32-2,FRANK>听见了吗
<32-2,FRANK>You hear me?

802
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:10,780
<32-2,FRANK>回家
<32-2,FRANK>Go back to the house.

803
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,520
<32-2,FRANK>洗干净
<32-2,FRANK>Get cleaned up.

804
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,080
<32-2,FRANK>走  快点
<32-2,FRANK>Go! Now!

805
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:23,740
<33-1,FRANK>接下来警察就来了
<33-1,FRANK>The next thing I knew, the cops were there.

806
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:26,210
<33-1,FRANK>我能做什么呢
<33-1,FRANK>I mean... what was I supposed to do?

807
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:27,720
<33-2,MAGGIE>大家需要知道真相  弗兰克
<33-2,MAGGIE>People need to know, Frank.

808
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,820
<33-2,MAGGIE>不  他们不需要知道
<33-2,MAGGIE>No, they don't.

809
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:30,960
<33-3,FRANK>如果他们问我  我就否认
<33-3,FRANK>And if they ask me, I'm gonna deny it.

810
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:32,390
<33-4,MAGGIE>他们要处决你了
<33-4,MAGGIE>They're about to kill you.

811
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:33,090
<33-5,FRANK>我知道
<33-5,FRANK>I know.

812
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:35,860
<33-6,MAGGIE>你却听之任之  其实是约翰做的啊
<33-6,MAGGIE>And you're gonna let them, when it was John who did this.

813
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:37,590
<33-7,FRANK>玛吉  他记不得了
<33-7,FRANK>Maggie, he doesn't remember.

814
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:40,990
<33-7,FRANK>他来了这里三四次
<33-7,FRANK>It took three, four times of him coming here for me to realize

815
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:43,450
<33-7,FRANK>我意识到他一点都记不起那晚的事
<33-7,FRANK>that he--he doesn't remember anything from that night.

816
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:48,500
<33-8,FRANK>我想凭借某些法律依据免于刑罚
<33-8,FRANK>Look, I always hoped I'd get off on some kind of technicality, you know?

817
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:50,270
<33-8,FRANK>但不是这个
<33-8,FRANK>Not this.

818
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:52,170
<33-8,FRANK>不能这样
<33-8,FRANK>Never this.

819
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:53,900
<33-8,FRANK>他过上了新生活
<33-8,FRANK>He's built a life.

820
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:55,490
<33-8,FRANK>他有妻子
<33-8,FRANK>He's got a wife.

821
00:33:56,150 --> 00:34:00,030
<33-8,FRANK>有两个孩子  我不能把这些从他身边夺走
<33-8,FRANK>He's got two kids, and I-I'm not gonna take that away from him.

822
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:02,130
<33-9,MAGGIE>弗兰克  求你
<33-9,MAGGIE>Frank, please...

823
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:03,470
<33-9,MAGGIE>对不起
<33-9,MAGGIE>I'm sorry.

824
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:06,050
<33-10,FRANK>只能这样了
<33-10,FRANK>This is the way it's gotta be.

825
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,230
<34-1,ALEXIS>我们一定还能做些什么
<34-1,ALEXIS>There must be something we can do.

826
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:22,360
<34-2,CASTLE>弗兰克不想我们那么做
<34-2,CASTLE>It's not what Frank wants.

827
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:24,970
<34-3,ALEXIS>但他是无辜的  爸爸  他就快要死了
<34-3,ALEXIS>But he's innocent, dad, and he's going to die.

828
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:26,080
<34-3,ALEXIS>明天
<34-3,ALEXIS>Tomorrow.

829
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,160
<33-5,FRANK>我知道
<33-5,FRANK>I know.

830
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:31,080
<34-5,ALEXIS>我都开始相信我们能救他了
<34-5,ALEXIS>I actually started believing we could save the guy.

831
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:33,030
<34-6,CASTLE>我们几乎做到了
<34-6,CASTLE>And we almost did.

832
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,650
<34-7,ALEXIS>我知道他有多爱玛吉
<34-7,ALEXIS>I know how much he loves Maggie.

833
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:37,480
<34-7,ALEXIS>如果他有时间再考虑考虑
<34-7,ALEXIS>If he just had more time to think about this,

834
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,930
<34-7,ALEXIS>可能就改变主意了
<34-7,ALEXIS>maybe he'd change his mind.

835
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:42,030
<34-7,ALEXIS>但没时间了
<34-7,ALEXIS>But the clock just ran out.

836
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:44,820
<34-8,CASTLE>时间
<34-8,CASTLE>The clock.

837
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:48,700
<34-8,CASTLE>那通报警电话是什么时候
<34-8,CASTLE>What time was that 9-1-1 call again?

838
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:52,030
<34-9,ALEXIS>邻居说是晚上8点04分听到尖叫声的
<34-9,ALEXIS>Uh, neighbor reported hearing the scream at 8:04 p.m.

839
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:52,580
<34-9,ALEXIS>怎么了
<34-9,ALEXIS>Why?

840
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:54,870
<34-10,CASTLE>我们遗漏了一些东西  来看这张照片
<34-10,CASTLE>We missed something. Come take a look at this photo.

841
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:58,340
<34-10,CASTLE>这个墙面装饰是在打斗时掉下来的
<34-10,CASTLE>This wall decoration could have fallen down during the struggle.

842
00:34:58,490 --> 00:34:59,680
<34-11,ALEXIS>你是说这个太阳系小物件
<34-11,ALEXIS>You mean the solar system thingy?

843
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:01,710
<34-12,CASTLE>不仅仅是太阳系小物件
<34-12,CASTLE>Not just a solar system thingy.

844
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:03,880
<34-12,CASTLE>太阳系的行星不会排列成这样
<34-12,CASTLE>Our orbiting planets don't line up like that.

845
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:05,450
<34-12,CASTLE>这是个二进制时钟
<34-12,CASTLE>This is a binary clock.

846
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:06,330
<34-13,ALEXIS>这是钟
<34-13,ALEXIS>That's a clock?

847
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:07,950
<34-14,CASTLE>是啊  金那样的理工女用的
<34-14,CASTLE>Yeah. For science geeks like Kim.

848
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:09,540
<34-14,CASTLE>数一下每个象限有几个行星
<34-14,CASTLE>You count the amount of planets in each quadrant,

849
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,400
<34-14,CASTLE>就能知道时间
<34-14,CASTLE>it tells you the time.

850
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:12,960
<34-14,CASTLE>这是7点32分
<34-14,CASTLE>In this case, 7:32.

851
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:16,550
<34-15,ALEXIS>32分  那是报警电话半小时前啊
<34-15,ALEXIS>32? That's a half-hour before our 9-1-1 call.

852
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,160
<34-16,CASTLE>那是因为弗兰克听到的尖叫声
<34-16,CASTLE>That's because the scream that Frank heard

853
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,270
<34-16,CASTLE>是8点04分约翰看到金的尸体时发出的
<34-16,CASTLE>came from John we he discovered Kim's body at 8:04.

854
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,900
<34-16,CASTLE>她已经死了半个小时了
<34-16,CASTLE>She'd already been dead for 30 minutes.

855
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:25,640
<34-17,ALEXIS>兄弟俩都是无辜的
<34-17,ALEXIS>Both brothers are innocent.

856
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,830
<35-1,ALEXIS>我刚跟金的母亲通过电话
<35-1,ALEXIS>Hey. I just got off the phone with Kim's mom.

857
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:36,820
<35-2,CASTLE>你打电话给金的母亲
<35-2,CASTLE>Whoa. You called Kim's mom?

858
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:37,860
<35-3,ALEXIS>走投无路了嘛
<35-3,ALEXIS>Desperate times.

859
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:38,940
<35-4,CASTLE>她没挂你电话吗
<35-4,CASTLE>And she didn't hang up on you?

860
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,670
<35-5,ALEXIS>没有  她只是一直在吼
<35-5,ALEXIS>No. She mostly yelled.

861
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:42,130
<35-5,ALEXIS>她不肯告诉我金辅导过谁
<35-5,ALEXIS>She wouldn't tell me who Kim tutored,

862
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:43,510
<35-5,ALEXIS>但她说了金的所有家教收入
<35-5,ALEXIS>but she did say that all the checks

863
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:45,930
<35-5,ALEXIS>都存入了她的大学基金
<35-5,ALEXIS>Kim got from tutoring went into her college fund.

864
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:48,350
<35-6,CASTLE>也就是说都是支票付款的
<35-6,CASTLE>So she was paid by check.

865
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,830
<35-7,CASTLE>这就表示可以查到谁付了钱给她
<35-7,CASTLE>That means somewhere there's a record of who paid her.

866
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:53,340
<35-8,ALEXIS>没错  莱恩和埃斯波西托正在查银行记录
<35-8,ALEXIS>Mm-hmm. Ryan and Esposito are checking banks now.

867
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,720
<35-8,ALEXIS>这就是我们的突破点了  爸
<35-8,ALEXIS>This is it, dad.

868
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,910
<35-8,ALEXIS>绿碧树林  冰毒  还有那些单车轮胎印
<35-8,ALEXIS>Jasper Grove, meth, the bike tracks --

869
00:35:56,910 --> 00:35:58,220
<35-8,ALEXIS>如果凶手不是弗兰克或是约翰的话
<35-8,ALEXIS>if it wasn't Frank or John,

870
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:00,050
<35-8,ALEXIS>那就肯定是其他那几个孩子的其中一个
<35-8,ALEXIS>it has to be one of those other kids.

871
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:03,970
<35-8,ALEXIS>你还在看那个录像吗
<35-8,ALEXIS>You still going through that video?

872
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:07,400
<35-9,CASTLE>是啊  既然我们现在知道凶手不是弗兰克也不是约翰
<35-9,CASTLE>Yeah. Now that we know neither Frank or John killed her,

873
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:08,800
<35-9,CASTLE>那么我看这个录像的角度就完全不同了
<35-9,CASTLE>this video plays very differently.

874
00:36:08,810 --> 00:36:09,720
<35-9,CASTLE>看这里
<35-9,CASTLE>Watch this.

875
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,190
<35-10,CASTLE>看到了吗
<35-10,CASTLE>See that?

876
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,720
<35-11,ALEXIS>没有  你让我看什么
<35-11,ALEXIS>No. What?

877
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:20,500
<35-12,CASTLE>弗兰克说他发现她的尸体在地上
<35-12,CASTLE>Frank said he found her body on the floor.

878
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,340
<35-12,CASTLE>他有提过他挪过尸体吗
<35-12,CASTLE>Did he ever mention moving her?

879
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:22,980
<35-12,CASTLE>没有
<35-12,CASTLE>No.

880
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:25,050
<35-13,ALEXIS>据弗兰克所说  他只是拉走了约翰
<35-13,ALEXIS>According to Frank, he just pulled John away.

881
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:27,060
<35-14,CASTLE>没错  扯断了吊坠手链
<35-14,CASTLE>Exactly. Breaking the charm bracelet,

882
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:28,150
<35-14,CASTLE>把吊坠弄了一地
<35-14,CASTLE>spilling the charm all over the floor.

883
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:31,410
<35-14,CASTLE>但是你看当验尸员小组
<35-14,CASTLE>But watch as a medical examiner's team

884
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:33,620
<35-14,CASTLE>第一次挪开她尸体的时候
<35-14,CASTLE>moves her body for the first time.

885
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,010
<35-15,CASTLE>看见了吗
<35-15,CASTLE>See it now?

886
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,960
<35-16,ALEXIS>好像是她手链上的一个吊坠
<35-16,ALEXIS>It looks like another charm from her bracelet.

887
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,360
<35-17,CASTLE>但是如果吊坠手链是在她死后才断的话
<35-17,CASTLE>But if the charm bracelet broke after she died,

888
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:49,210
<35-17,CASTLE>那这个吊坠又怎么会压在她的身下呢
<35-17,CASTLE>how did the charm end up under her body?

889
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:54,380
<36-1,BECKETT>卡塞尔  我们从实验室拿到证据箱了
<36-1,BECKETT>Okay, Castle, we got the evidence box from the lab.

890
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,600
<36-1,BECKETT>我们要找什么
<36-1,BECKETT>What are we looking for?

891
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:58,620
<36-2,CASTLE>证据记录单上写着里面应该有个证据袋  里面装着
<36-2,CASTLE>Okay, the evidence log says there should be a bag containing charms

892
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:00,770
<36-2,CASTLE>金断了的吊坠手链上的装饰物
<36-2,CASTLE>from Kim's broken charm bracelet.

893
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:01,670
<36-3,LANIE>找到了
<36-3,LANIE>Got it.

894
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:03,750
<36-4,CASTLE>其中一个吊坠应该是个海豚形状的
<36-4,CASTLE>One of those charms should be shaped like a dolphin.

895
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:09,740
<36-5,BECKETT>在呢
<36-5,BECKETT>It's here.

896
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:11,920
<36-6,ALEXIS>手链应该也在里面
<36-6,ALEXIS>You should have the rope bracelet there, too.

897
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,210
<36-6,ALEXIS>把那个海豚吊坠串到绳子上
<36-6,ALEXIS>Thread that dolphin charm onto the bracelet.

898
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:16,540
<36-7,LANIE>好的  我正在串
<36-7,LANIE>Okay...I'm threading.

899
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:20,070
<36-8,LANIE>不行  串不上
<36-8,LANIE>Nope. Can't do it.

900
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:20,970
<36-8,LANIE>洞眼太小了
<36-8,LANIE>The hole's too small.

901
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:21,800
<36-8,LANIE>串不上
<36-8,LANIE>It doesn't fit.

902
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,800
<36-9,CASTLE>那是因为这个吊坠根本就不是从金手链上掉下来的
<36-9,CASTLE>That's because it didn't come from Kim's bracelet.

903
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,230
<36-10,ALEXIS>而是凶手留下的
<36-10,ALEXIS>It was left behind by our killer.

904
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:27,510
<36-11,CASTLE>蕾妮  你能从那个吊坠上提取到DNA吗
<36-11,CASTLE>Lanie, can you get D.N.A. off that charm?

905
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:30,940
<36-12,LANIE>也许吧  但除非你能找到与之匹配的DNA  不然没用
<36-12,LANIE>Maybe, but it won't help unless you have someone to match it to.

906
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:34,070
<36-13,ALEXIS>我们必须找出她在辅导谁
<36-13,ALEXIS>We need to know who she was tutoring.

907
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:37,110
<37-1,ALEXIS>你应该再给他们打个电话
<37-1,ALEXIS>You should call them again.

908
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:39,790
<37-2,CASTLE>我20分钟前才刚给他们打过电话
<37-2,CASTLE>I just called them 20 minutes ago.

909
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:42,140
<37-3,ALEXIS>我就不明白了  怎么要这么久呢
<37-3,ALEXIS>I don't understand. Why is it taking so long?

910
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,080
<37-3,ALEXIS>莱恩在几个小时前就查到金在哪开的户了
<37-3,ALEXIS>Ryan found the bank where Kim had her account hours ago.

911
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,870
<37-4,CASTLE>那个账户早在98年就关闭了
<37-4,CASTLE>The account was closed in '98.

912
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:48,720
<37-4,CASTLE>从那以后那间银行搬迁了三次
<37-4,CASTLE>The bank has moved three times since then.

913
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,300
<37-4,CASTLE>他们可能没有保存那些文档
<37-4,CASTLE>They may not have even kept the files.

914
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,470
<37-5,ALEXIS>万一他们没保存呢
<37-5,ALEXIS>And what if they didn't?

915
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:52,330
<37-5,ALEXIS>我们就快没时间了
<37-5,ALEXIS>We're running out of time.

916
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:53,480
<37-5,ALEXIS>我们得去见法官
<37-5,ALEXIS>We need to go to the judge.

917
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,190
<37-6,CASTLE>空口无凭的去吗
<37-6,CASTLE>With what?

918
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:56,140
<37-6,CASTLE>弗兰克永远都不会承认他在保护约翰
<37-6,CASTLE>Frank will never admit to covering for John.

919
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:57,180
<37-6,CASTLE>那会导致他们发现约翰也在犯罪现场
<37-6,CASTLE>That would put John at the crime scene.

920
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,330
<37-7,ALEXIS>那我们怎么办
<37-7,ALEXIS>So what do we do?

921
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,910
<37-7,ALEXIS>爸  告诉我该怎么办
<37-7,ALEXIS>Dad, tell me what to do!

922
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:00,760
<37-8,CASTLE>我不知道
<37-8,CASTLE>Hey, I don't know,

923
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,440
<37-8,CASTLE>但不管发生什么事  我们都会一起面对
<37-8,CASTLE>but whatever happens, we're gonna deal with it.

924
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,820
<37-8,CASTLE>好吗
<37-8,CASTLE>All right?

925
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:06,510
<37-8,CASTLE>一起面对
<37-8,CASTLE>Together.

926
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:12,020
<37-9,ALEXIS>生你气  我很抱歉
<37-9,ALEXIS>I'm sorry I was mad at you.

927
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:15,620
<37-10,CASTLE>不  是我活该  对不起
<37-10,CASTLE>Oh, no. I deserved it. I'm sorry.

928
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:22,130
<37-10,CASTLE>喂

<37-11,CASTLE>名字是
<37-11,CASTLE>What are the names?

930
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:36,330
<38-1,CASTLE>雷恩警长
<38-1,CASTLE>Chief Lane.

931
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,400
<38-2,POLICE CHIEF LANE>有什么可以为你们效劳的吗
<38-2,POLICE CHIEF LANE>Can I help you?

932
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,470

00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:39,620
<38-3,CASTLE>但是我们可以为您效劳
<38-3,CASTLE>But we can help you.

934
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:41,750
<38-4,CASTLE>在金·塔伯特被害的当晚
<38-4,CASTLE>This little dolphin pendant

935
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:44,560
<38-4,CASTLE>证据科在她的客厅里发现了这个海豚吊坠
<38-4,CASTLE>was found in Kim Tolbert's living room the night she died,

936
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,900
<38-4,CASTLE>压在她的身下
<38-4,CASTLE>underneath her body.

937
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:46,760
<38-5,CHIEF LANE>所以呢
<38-5,CHIEF LANE>So?

938
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,270
<38-6,ALEXIS>这不是她的
<38-6,ALEXIS>So it's not hers.

939
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:50,450
<38-7,OFFICER LANE>你们这些人真是不可理喻
<38-7,OFFICER LANE>You people are unbelievable.

940
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:52,850
<38-8,ALEXIS>雷恩警官  金去世的那年你多大
<38-8,ALEXIS>Officer Lane, how old were you when Kim died?

941
00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:53,500
<38-9,OFFICER LANE>你说什么
<38-9,OFFICER LANE>Excuse me?

942
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,520
<38-10,ALEXIS>你跟她同班
<38-10,ALEXIS>You were in her class.

943
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,320
<38-10,ALEXIS>实际上  她还给你辅导过  对吧
<38-10,ALEXIS>In fact, she tutored you, didn't she?

944
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,610
<38-11,CHIEF LANE>你们到底想要说什么
<38-11,CHIEF LANE>What's this all about?

945
00:38:57,610 --> 00:38:59,920
<38-12,CASTLE>你给金·塔伯特开过支票  警长
<38-12,CASTLE>Checks you wrote to Kim Tolbert, chief,

946
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:01,210
<38-12,CASTLE>作为你儿子的辅导费
<38-12,CASTLE>to pay for your son's tutoring.

947
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:03,040
<38-13,CHIEF LANE>他需要补习才能提高成绩
<38-13,CHIEF LANE>Needed some help keeping his grades up.

948
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,430
<38-14,CASTLE>我打赌那是因为游泳队
<38-14,CASTLE>Yeah, I bet because of swim team.

949
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:05,750
<38-14,CASTLE>你们那年拿了州冠军
<38-14,CASTLE>You guys took state that year.

950
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:06,860
<38-14,CASTLE>那可是大新闻
<38-14,CASTLE>It was big news.

951
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:11,630
<38-15,CHIEF LANE>泰迪  这到底是怎么回事
<38-15,CHIEF LANE>Teddy, what's going on here?

952
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,740
<38-16,ALEXIS>金·塔伯特被害当晚  她去过绿碧树林
<38-16,ALEXIS>The night Kim Tolbert was murdered, she was in Jasper Grove,

953
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:18,180
<38-16,ALEXIS>就在你在那年强行回收的一个农场附近
<38-16,ALEXIS>near a farmhouse you had foreclosed on a year earlier.

954
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:20,470
<38-16,ALEXIS>后来那房子被证实受到了
<38-16,ALEXIS>That house was later found to be contaminated

955
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:22,070
<38-16,ALEXIS>冰毒残留物的污染
<38-16,ALEXIS>with methamphetamine residue.

956
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:25,040
<38-17,CASTLE>我们有理由相信你的儿子参与了制造冰毒
<38-17,CASTLE>We believe your son was one of the people who contaminated it.

957
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,670
<38-17,CASTLE>我们还有理由相信他之所以想要补习化学
<38-17,CASTLE>We also believe he wanted to be tutored in chemistry

958
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,300
<38-17,CASTLE>是为了学做冰毒
<38-17,CASTLE>so he could learn how to cook meth.

959
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,620
<38-18,OFFICER LANE>这太荒唐了
<38-18,OFFICER LANE>This is ridiculous.

960
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:32,700
<38-19,CASTLE>但是金发现了你的秘密
<38-19,CASTLE>But Kim caught on to you,

961
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,470
<38-19,CASTLE>那对你们很不利
<38-19,CASTLE>and that was bad for business.

962
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:37,490
<38-19,CASTLE>所以当她离开那个派对时  你跟踪了她
<38-19,CASTLE>So when she left that party, you followed her.

963
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:39,420
<38-20,ALEXIS>我们在她身上找到了硝酸铵
<38-20,ALEXIS>We found ammonium nitrate on her body.

964
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:41,950
<38-20,ALEXIS>我愿意打赌  在那间农场外面的
<38-20,ALEXIS>I'd be willing to bet that the tire treads

965
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,790
<38-20,ALEXIS>单车轮胎印  跟金遇害当晚
<38-20,ALEXIS>outside the farmhouse are going to be a match

966
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,820
<38-20,ALEXIS>在她家屋后找到的单车轮胎印将会匹配
<38-20,ALEXIS>to the bike treads behind Kim's house the night of her murder.

967
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,620
<38-20,ALEXIS>当然了  除此之外还有这个
<38-20,ALEXIS>And then, of course, there's that.

968
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:55,580
<38-21,CASTLE>这对于法官来说已经是足够的间接证据了
<38-21,CASTLE>Now that's enough circumstantial evidence for a judge...

969
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:58,380
<38-21,CASTLE>但现在是2013年
<38-21,CASTLE>but it's 2013.

970
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:01,190
<38-21,CASTLE>我是说  我们现在可以提取降解的DNA
<38-21,CASTLE>I mean, now we can even take degraded D.N.A.,

971
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:03,390
<38-21,CASTLE>将其放大  测试
<38-21,CASTLE>have it amplified, tested.

972
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:06,680
<38-21,CASTLE>而且我肯定你们的证据存储科
<38-21,CASTLE>And I'm sure that your evidence storage

973
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:09,480
<38-21,CASTLE>完好的保留了你的海豚
<38-21,CASTLE>has kept your dolphin well preserved.

974
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,760
<38-22,CHIEF LANE>泰迪
<38-22,CHIEF LANE>Teddy?

975
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,710
<38-22,CHIEF LANE>说话呀
<38-22,CHIEF LANE>Say something.

976
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:20,210
<38-22,CHIEF LANE>看着我
<38-22,CHIEF LANE>Look at me.

977
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:22,400
<38-22,CHIEF LANE>泰迪
<38-22,CHIEF LANE>Teddy!

978
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:31,570
<39-1,JUDGE>鉴于大量的间接证据
<39-1,JUDGE>Based on the overwhelming circumstantial evidence

979
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:33,440
<39-1,JUDGE>和定罪后获取的
<39-1,JUDGE>and the exculpatory results

980
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,150
<39-1,JUDGE>DNA检验的辩护结果
<39-1,JUDGE>obtained from post-conviction D.N.A. testing,

981
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:38,560
<39-1,JUDGE>宾夕法尼亚联邦政府特此撤销
<39-1,JUDGE>the commonwealth of Pennsylvania hereby vacates

982
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:41,750
<39-1,JUDGE>对弗兰克林·托马斯·汉森的谋杀定罪
<39-1,JUDGE>Franklin Thomas Henson's murder conviction

983
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:44,180
<39-1,JUDGE>并免除他的所有罪行
<39-1,JUDGE>and sanctions his exoneration.

984
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,880
<39-2,JUDGE>我相信在此之前你已经
<39-2,JUDGE>I'm sure you've spent far too many years

985
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,590
<39-2,JUDGE>被法官高高在上地蔑视了太多年了
<39-2,JUDGE>having judges look down on you,

986
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,790
<39-2,JUDGE>所以这次我将会亲自从法官椅走下来
<39-2,JUDGE>so I'll come down from the bench

987
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:54,570
<39-2,JUDGE>并亲手将这份签署好的释放函交给你
