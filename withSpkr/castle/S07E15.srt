23
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,250
<1-1,JAVIER ESPOSITO>你确定她是说要来这里吗
<1-1,JAVIER ESPOSITO>You sure this is where she said she was going?

24
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,210
<1-2,RICHARD CASTLE>对  第九大道和珍街街角
<1-2,RICHARD CASTLE>Yeah, yeah 9th and Jane.

25
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,770
<1-3,KEVIN RYAN>托瑞说还是追踪不到贝克特的电话
<1-3,KEVIN RYAN>Tory said she still can't get a trace on Beckett's phone.

26
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:56,250
<1-3,KEVIN RYAN>说不是被关机就是被毁了
<1-3,KEVIN RYAN>Says it's either been turned off or disabled.

27
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:00,430
<1-4,CASTLE>那里  那是她的车
<1-4,CASTLE>There. There's her car.

32
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:09,180
<1-5,CASTLE>救救她
<1-5,CASTLE>"Help her!"

34
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,690
<1-5,CASTLE>他们要我们知道他们抓走了她
<1-5,CASTLE>They want us to know they have her.

35
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:15,530
<1-7,RYAN>-该死  -把鉴证组叫来
<1-7,RYAN>- Damn. - All right, let's get CSU down here!

36
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:18,520
<1-8,ESPOSITO>全员出动  所有值勤警员全部进行搜索
<1-8,ESPOSITO>Call in a 10-45! I want every available unit canvassing!

37
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,940
<1-8,ESPOSITO>排查每一个人
<1-8,ESPOSITO>Ask everyone questions!

38
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:20,660
<1-8,ESPOSITO>肯定有人看到她了  开始行动
<1-8,ESPOSITO>Somebody had to have seen her! Let's go!

39
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:23,690
<1-9,RYAN>我们要查看这一带所有的监控摄像头
<1-9,RYAN>We're gonna dig into all the security and traffic cams in the area...

40
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:26,140
<1-9,RYAN>所有提款机  商户  所有能看到街面的东西
<1-9,RYAN>Any ATMs, businesses, anything with eyes on the street.

41
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:27,230
<1-9,RYAN>行动
<1-9,RYAN>Go, go, go!

42
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,330
<1-10,ESPOSITO>卡塞尔
<1-10,ESPOSITO>Castle?

43
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:29,910
<1-10,ESPOSITO>是他
<1-10,ESPOSITO>It's him.

44
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
<1-11,CASTLE>布德罗  泰森  不管他自称什么
<1-11,CASTLE>Boudreau, Tyson, whatever he's calling himself...

45
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,980
<1-11,CASTLE>是他  是尼曼
<1-11,CASTLE>It's him, and it's Nieman.

46
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:34,400
<1-12,RYAN>但他们当时在分局啊
<1-12,RYAN>But they were in the precinct with us.

47
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,080
<1-13,CASTLE>这样他们有完美的不在场证明
<1-13,CASTLE>Giving them the perfect alibi.

48
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,780
<1-13,CASTLE>却利用艾米·巴瑞特把贝克特引出来
<1-13,CASTLE>Meanwhile, they use Amy Barrett as bait to draw Beckett out.

49
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,160
<1-14,RYAN>你觉得巴瑞特也有关
<1-14,RYAN>You think Barrett was involved with this?

50
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,680
<1-15,ESPOSITO>或者她也是受害人
<1-15,ESPOSITO>Or she's a victim, too.

51
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:43,440
<1-16,CASTLE>我们得找到尼曼
<1-16,CASTLE>We need to find Nieman,

52
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,240
<1-16,CASTLE>我们得找到布德罗
<1-16,CASTLE>and we need to find Boudreau.

53
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,010
<2-1,RYAN>布德罗先生  开门
<2-1,RYAN>Mr. Boudreau, open up!

54
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,990
<2-2,RYAN>布德罗先生  我们一位警探
<2-2,RYAN>Mr. Boudreau, shortly after leaving

55
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:53,250
<2-2,RYAN>离开去见你朋友艾米·巴瑞特
<2-2,RYAN>to meet with your friend Amy Barrett,

56
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,970
<2-2,RYAN>不久后便失踪了
<2-2,RYAN>one of our detectives went missing.

57
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:55,690
<2-3,TYSON>所以呢
<2-3,TYSON>So?

58
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:57,480
<2-4,CASTLE>-她在哪  -我不知道
<2-4,CASTLE>- So, where is she? - I don't know.

59
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,190
<2-5,TYSON>我直到一小时前才被释放
<2-5,TYSON>I've been in police custody until an hour ago.

60
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:02,000
<2-6,CASTLE>这样你有了完美的不在场证明
<2-6,CASTLE>Giving you the perfect alibi.

61
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,080
<2-7,TYSON>我有不在场证明或许是因为我没做什么错事
<2-7,TYSON>Maybe I have an alibi 'cause I didn't do anything wrong.

62
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:07,100
<2-8,CASTLE>那为什么不让我们进去呢
<2-8,CASTLE>Then why don't you let us in?

63
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,410
<2-9,TYSON>好啊
<2-9,TYSON>Fine.

64
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,380
<2-10,CASTLE>贝克特
<2-10,CASTLE>Beckett?

65
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,860
<2-11,TYSON>-贝克特  -拜托  这里没人  只有我
<2-11,TYSON>- Beckett?! - Come on, man. Nobody's here. It's just me.

66
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:23,810
<2-12,CASTLE>你对她做了什么  泰森
<2-12,CASTLE>What'd you do to her? Huh, Tyson?

67
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:24,410
<2-12,CASTLE>你把她关在哪了
<2-12,CASTLE>Where are you keeping her?

68
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:27,660
<2-13,TYSON>我没关她  而且我也不是杰瑞·泰森
<2-13,TYSON>I'm not keeping her anywhere, and I'm not Jerry Tyson.

69
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,480
<2-14,TYSON>不不  你别这样  你不能这样
<2-14,TYSON>No, no! Come on! You can't do this.

70
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,350
<2-14,TYSON>你不能跑进来威胁我
<2-14,TYSON>You can't just come in here threatening me.

71
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,850
<2-15,CASTLE>我知道是你  我知道是你
<2-15,CASTLE>I know it's you! I know it's you.

72
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,630
<2-16,RYAN>你这样帮不了她  这样不行
<2-16,RYAN>You're not helping her... not like that.

73
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,520
<2-17,CASTLE>-怎么  我们就等着她被杀吗  -不
<2-17,CASTLE>- So what? We just let him kill her? - No.

74
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:40,240
<2-18,RYAN>但是卡塞尔  我们如果没有证据
<2-18,RYAN>But, Castle, we can't do anything

75
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,750
<2-18,RYAN>就不能做什么
<2-18,RYAN>if we don't have anything.

76
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,070
<2-19,CASTLE>是他  凯文  是泰森
<2-19,CASTLE>It's him, Kevin. It's Tyson.

77
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:45,890
<2-19,CASTLE>我们得证明
<2-19,CASTLE>We need to prove it.

78
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,620
<2-20,RYAN>我们让警员跟踪他  盯死他
<2-20,RYAN>We'll put units on him, put him under the microscope.

79
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,590
<2-20,RYAN>如果是他
<2-20,RYAN>If it's him,

80
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:53,230
<2-20,RYAN>他的一举一动我们都会知道
<2-20,RYAN>he won't be able to make a move without us knowing it.

81
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:55,620
<2-20,RYAN>我们会找到她的
<2-20,RYAN>We'll find her.

82
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:05,160
<3-1,KELLY NIEMAN>随便你看吧  埃斯波西托警探
<3-1,KELLY NIEMAN>Okay, look all you want, detective Esposito,

83
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,490
<3-1,KELLY NIEMAN>她不在这里  我不知道她在哪里
<3-1,KELLY NIEMAN>She's not here, and I have no idea where she is.

84
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:09,240
<3-2,ESPOSITO>那你的客户艾米·巴瑞特呢
<3-2,ESPOSITO>What about your client Amy Barrett?

85
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,420
<3-3,NIEMAN>我们办公室已经将她的信息交给你们了
<3-3,NIEMAN>My office gave you our information on Amy Barrett.

86
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,740
<3-3,NIEMAN>我们的联络信息过期我也没办法
<3-3,NIEMAN>I can't help it if her contact information is out of date.

87
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,670
<3-4,ESPOSITO>当然了  就像你跟贝克特探长的失踪
<3-4,ESPOSITO>Yeah, I bet you can't... just like you have nothing to do with

88
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,440
<3-4,ESPOSITO>也是毫无瓜葛
<3-4,ESPOSITO>Detective Beckett's disappearance.

89
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:19,810
<3-5,NIEMAN>你似乎是对我有错误的看法
<3-5,NIEMAN>You seem to think that I'm something that I'm not.

90
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:21,770
<3-5,NIEMAN>我怎么可能与此有关
<3-5,NIEMAN>And how could I be involved?

91
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:23,800
<3-5,NIEMAN>我当时跟你们在一起
<3-5,NIEMAN>I was with you at the time.

92
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,170
<4-1,RYAN>我安排警员监视布德罗的住处
<4-1,RYAN>I got a unit on Boudreau's place

93
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,600
<4-1,RYAN>还有一辆跟踪车在待命
<4-1,RYAN>and a follow car standing by.

94
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,800
<4-2,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>-埃斯波  也派人去监视尼曼  -是
<4-2,CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES>- Espo, put units on Nieman, as well. - Copy that.

95
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:30,990
<4-4,CASTLE>排查有什么发现吗
<4-4,CASTLE>Anything on the canvass?

96
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:33,660
<4-5,GATES>我们已经抽调了三区和八区的警员来帮忙
<4-5,GATES>We've pulled officers from the 3rd and 8th precincts to help.

97
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,340
<4-5,GATES>如果有目击者  我们一定会找到的
<4-5,GATES>If there's a witness out there, we'll find them.

98
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:35,950
<4-6,CASTLE>监控录像呢
<4-6,CASTLE>How about video?

99
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,540
<4-7,TORY ELLIS>你们发现她车的那个区域
<4-7,TORY ELLIS>The immediate area where you found her car

100
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,610
<4-7,TORY ELLIS>没有监控设备覆盖
<4-7,TORY ELLIS>didn't have any street-cam or security coverage.

101
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:41,500
<4-8,ESPOSITO>简直是绑架的绝佳地点
<4-8,ESPOSITO>Making it the perfect place for an abduction.

102
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,700
<4-9,TORY>我派了四区的一组人在查看贝克特被绑时
<4-9,TORY>I have teams from four precincts pulling all video

103
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,950
<4-9,TORY>半径十个街区范围内的所有监控录像
<4-9,TORY>In a 10-block radius from where Beckett was taken.

104
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:46,820
<4-9,TORY>机会渺茫  不过...
<4-9,TORY>It's a long shot, but...

105
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:47,680
<4-10,CASTLE>艾米·巴瑞特呢
<4-10,CASTLE>What about Amy Barrett...

106
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,190
<4-10,CASTLE>她打给贝克特的那通电话
<4-10,CASTLE>The phone call she made to Beckett?

107
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,420
<4-10,CASTLE>-能追踪吗  -我们试了
<4-10,CASTLE>- Can we trace that? - We did...

108
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,230
<4-11,TORY>查到一部手机  但已经停止使用了
<4-11,TORY>to a cellphone. It's no longer active.

109
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:54,090
<4-12,ESPOSITO>但我们已经把艾米的照片发给了
<4-12,ESPOSITO>But we've got Amy's picture out to every cop

110
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:55,710
<4-12,ESPOSITO>城里的所有警员及交警
<4-12,ESPOSITO>and every transit worker in the city.

111
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,980
<4-13,CASTLE>艾米肯定不会公开露面
<4-13,CASTLE>Amy's not gonna be in public...

112
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,080
<4-13,CASTLE>如果她真在跟泰森合作的话
<4-13,CASTLE>not if she's working with Tyson.

113
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,050
<4-14,GATES>我们推测布德罗就是泰森  可是...
<4-14,GATES>And we're assuming Boudreau is Tyson.But ....

114
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,610
<4-14,GATES>如果
<4-14,GATES>what if

115
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:06,590
<4-14,GATES>迈克·布德罗真是他自己呢
<4-14,GATES>Mike Boudreau is really Mike Boudreau?

116
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,480
<4-14,GATES>如果是尼曼把他整容成了泰森的样子
<4-14,GATES>What if Nieman actually cut him to look like Tyson

117
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,610
<4-14,GATES>好转移我们的注意力呢
<4-14,GATES>just to give us someone to chase?

118
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,420
<4-14,GATES>如果真正的杰瑞·泰森还在别处逍遥呢
<4-14,GATES>What if the real Jerry Tyson is still out there?

119
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,460
<4-14,GATES>不会
<4-14,GATES>No.

120
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,850
<4-15,CASTLE>他只是想扰乱我们的思路
<4-15,CASTLE>He's just messing with our heads.

121
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:21,800
<4-15,CASTLE>布德罗就是泰森
<4-15,CASTLE>Boudreau is Tyson.

122
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,880
<4-16,GATES>这说不通
<4-16,GATES>It doesn't make any sense.

123
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:25,730
<4-16,GATES>他为什么要让自己被捕
<4-16,GATES>Why would he let himself get arrested?

124
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:29,130
<4-16,GATES>他为什么要冒险回到自己的公寓
<4-16,GATES>Why would he risk returning to his apartment?

125
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:31,960
<4-16,GATES>这样刺激
<4-16,GATES>It's part of the thrill.

126
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:35,380
<4-17,CASTLE>来到这里
<4-17,CASTLE>To be here...

127
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,140
<4-17,CASTLE>跟我们一起  看似唾手可得
<4-17,CASTLE>a-among us, within our grasp.

128
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:41,610
<4-17,CASTLE>他想看他能多么接近火苗
<4-17,CASTLE>He wants to see how close he can get to the flame.

129
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:43,280
<4-17,CASTLE>这就是令他兴奋之处
<4-17,CASTLE>That's what excites him.

130
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,300
<4-17,CASTLE>他享受的不只是杀人  更是这场游戏
<4-17,CASTLE>It's not just the murder he likes... it's the game.

131
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:48,830
<4-17,CASTLE>我们抓住了他  然后就放松了警惕
<4-17,CASTLE>We had him, and we let our guard down.

132
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,260
<4-17,CASTLE>这就是他的计划
<4-17,CASTLE>That was his plan.

133
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,710
<4-18,CASTLE>喂
<4-18,CASTLE>Hello?

134
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,000
<4-19,KATE BECKETT>卡塞尔  能听到吗
<4-19,KATE BECKETT>Castle, can you hear me?

135
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:57,080
<4-21,BECKETT>-贝克特  -卡塞尔  我需要你的帮助
<4-21,BECKETT>- Beckett! - Please, Castle, I need your help.

136
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:57,780
<4-22,CASTLE>你在哪
<4-22,CASTLE>Where are you?

137
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:58,730
<4-22,CASTLE>天啊
<4-22,CASTLE>Oh, God.

138
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:00,670
<4-23,BECKETT>卡塞尔  拜托
<4-23,BECKETT>Castle, please!

139
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,660
<4-23,BECKETT>你得救我
<4-23,BECKETT>You have to help me!

<7-1,TORY>他们没录  这是伪造的
<7-1,TORY>They didn't... the recording was manufactured,

183
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:44,490
<7-1,TORY>是用几个不同的音源剪辑拼接在一起的
<7-1,TORY>Digitally spliced from what appear to be several different sources.

<7-2,CASTLE>What sources?

185
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:46,800
<7-3,TORY>比如  这个
<7-3,TORY>This, for one.

186
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:47,820
<7-3,TORY>这是你失踪后
<7-3,TORY>It's an interview Beckett gave

187
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:50,250
<7-3,TORY>贝克特接受本地新闻的一段访问
<7-3,TORY>to the local news just after you disappeared.

194
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,190
<7-7,TORY>其中一些话有背景杂音
<7-7,TORY>Given the background noise on some of these other words,

195
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,460
<7-7,TORY>所以我想有一部分是用反射式话筒
<7-7,TORY>I'm guessing parts of this were recorded in public

196
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,750
<7-7,TORY>在公共场所录的
<7-7,TORY>using a parabolic mike on the street,

197
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,920
<7-7,TORY>甚至可能是在一些犯罪现场
<7-7,TORY>Maybe even at crime scenes.

198
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,140
<7-8,RYAN>这是计划好的  他们已经准备了好几个月
<7-8,RYAN>This was planned. They've been preparing this for months.

199
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:14,650
<7-9,TORY>看样子是的
<7-9,TORY>Looks that way.

200
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:15,700
<7-10,RYAN>这是为了向贝克特报仇
<7-10,RYAN>This was about Beckett.

201
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:16,770
<7-10,RYAN>不
<7-10,RYAN>No.

202

203
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,240
<7-11,CASTLE>是给我的一条信息
<7-11,CASTLE>as a message to me.

204
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,050
<7-11,CASTLE>他想让我痛苦
<7-11,CASTLE>He wants me to suffer.

205
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,350
<7-11,CASTLE>为什么
<7-11,CASTLE>Why?

206
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,790
<7-12,GATES>泰森为什么咬住你不放
<7-12,GATES>Why is Tyson fixated on you?

207
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,030
<7-12,GATES>如果他是想对付你的话  他或许会联系你
<7-12,GATES>If he's directing this at you, he may try to communicate.

208
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,530
<7-12,GATES>我们应该监听你所有的电话
<7-12,GATES>We should put a tap and a trace on all your phones.

209
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,320
<7-13,TORY>我去安排
<7-13,TORY>I'll set it up.

210
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,060
<7-14,CASTLE>警监  他已经在跟我交流了
<7-14,CASTLE>Captain, he's already communicating.

211
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,650
<7-14,CASTLE>他就在那  躲在布德罗的公寓里
<7-14,CASTLE>He's out there, sitting in Boudreau's apartment.

212
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:40,930
<7-14,CASTLE>而且他知道她在哪
<7-14,CASTLE>And he knows where she is.

213
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,210
<7-15,GATES>除非我们有证据  否则我们动不了他
<7-15,GATES>And we can't touch him until we have proof.

214
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,160
<7-16,CASTLE>那时候她就已经死了
<7-16,CASTLE>By then, she'll be dead!

215
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,710
<7-16,CASTLE>求你了  警监  这...她是我妻子
<7-16,CASTLE>Please, Captain. This is... she's my wife.

216
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,760
<7-17,GATES>卡塞尔先生  我知道你很心痛  我们也是
<7-17,GATES>Mr. Castle, I know you're hurting. We all are.

217
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,410
<7-17,GATES>但是我们要保持机敏
<7-17,GATES>But we have to keep our wits about us.

218
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,420
<7-17,GATES>我们要找出证据
<7-17,GATES>We have to work the evidence.

219
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,470
<7-17,GATES>只有这样才能把她救回来
<7-17,GATES>It's the only way we can get her back.

220
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,600
<7-17,GATES>警监

00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:08,780
<7-18,ESPOSITO>目击者还说  她当时好像昏迷了
<7-18,ESPOSITO>And, the witness also said she appeared unconscious.

226
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:10,070
<7-19,RYAN>一定是被人下药了
<7-19,RYAN>She must've been drugged.

227
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,380
<7-20,GATES>看见和她一起的人了吗
<7-20,GATES>Did they see who was with her?

<11-1,ESPOSITO>你知道这对调查的影响有多大吗
<11-1,ESPOSITO>Do you have any idea what this does to the investigation?

00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,580
<11-1,ESPOSITO>你觉得我就不想过去

303
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:07,220
<11-1,ESPOSITO>揍他一顿吗
<11-1,ESPOSITO>and beat the hell out of him --

<11-2,RYAN>但这没法换她回来

<11-2,RYAN>他要起诉你
<11-2,RYAN>He's pressing charges.

<11-2,RYAN>我们必须立案拘留你
<11-2,RYAN>We're gonna have to book you.

308
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:20,940
<11-2,RYAN>拘留我

<11-4,RYAN>我们没证据能拘留他
<11-4,RYAN>We don't have anything to hold him on.

311
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,210
<12-1,GATES>你正面跟他冲突是没法取胜的
<12-1,GATES>You were never gonna win going straight at him.

312
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,750
<12-1,GATES>如果他知道你可能成功
<12-1,GATES>If he thought there was any chance of that,

313
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,350
<12-1,GATES>那就绝不会留在公寓
<12-1,GATES>then he wouldn't have stayed in that apartment.

314
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:56,230
<12-2,GATES>我们稍后再处理拘留的手续
<12-2,GATES>We'll take care of the rest of the booking details later.

317
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:07,610
<12-5,GATES>简直无法理解贝克特到底喜欢你哪点
<12-5,GATES>I couldn't figure out what Beckett saw in you.

318
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,090
<12-5,GATES>但你知道她是怎么说的吗
<12-5,GATES>But you know what she said?

319
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:13,250
<12-5,GATES>她说他能看清整个故事
<12-5,GATES>"He sees the story.

<12-5,GATES>"I see the evidence, where it leads,

321
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:19,680
<12-5,GATES>但他能看到整个故事的全局
<12-5,GATES>but he sees the story."

322
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:25,330
<12-5,GATES>那个人扰乱了你的思维  你让他得逞了
<12-5,GATES>That man got inside your head, and you let him.

323
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:27,410
<12-5,GATES>你想要救她
<12-5,GATES>You want to help her,

324
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:30,170
<12-5,GATES>就得潜入他的思维
<12-5,GATES>you got to get inside his.

325
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,130
<12-5,GATES>他在写什么故事
<12-5,GATES>What's his story?

326
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,410
<12-5,GATES>接下来他要做什么
<12-5,GATES>What's his next move going to be?

327
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:39,340
<12-5,GATES>想明白这个
<12-5,GATES>Now, you figure that out,

328
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:40,960
<12-5,GATES>我们就能找到她
<12-5,GATES>and we'll find her.

329
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,280
<12-6,RYAN>长官

331
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:46,930
<12-7,GATES>是布德罗  泰森
<12-7,GATES>It's Boudreau -- Tyson.

332
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,000
<12-8,RYAN>在回公寓的路上
<12-8,RYAN>On the way back to his apartment,

333
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:50,050
<12-8,RYAN>他冲下地铁月台跳上了铁轨
<12-8,RYAN>He bolted on the subway platform and jumped onto the tracks.

334
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,140
<12-8,RYAN>警员试图跟上  结果跟丢了
<12-8,RYAN>Our guys tried to follow, but they lost him.

<13-1,GATES>Put every unit in the area on the lookout

337
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:59,250
<13-1,GATES>出动所有警力寻找他
<13-1,GATES>and get his picture on the wire!

338
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,350
<13-1,GATES>我要找到他

<13-2,ESPOSITO>警监  我刚派了人去凯莉·尼曼家
<13-2,ESPOSITO>Captain, I just sent teams to Kelly Nieman's apartment

340
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:03,700
<13-2,ESPOSITO>查看她的状况
<13-2,ESPOSITO>to check on her.

341
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:04,380
<7-16,CASTLE>她不见了
<7-16,CASTLE>She's gone.

<13-3,GATES>她怎么会不见  我们一直在盯着她的呀
<13-3,GATES>How can she be gone? We've been on her place the whole time.

<13-4,ESPOSITO>他们发现了条通向楼顶的通道
<13-4,ESPOSITO>They found an access door to the roof open.

344
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,400
<13-4,ESPOSITO>她肯定是从哪里跑了出去
<13-4,ESPOSITO>She must have went out of it

345
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:11,230
<13-4,ESPOSITO>从楼顶爬去了其他建筑物
<13-4,ESPOSITO>and climbed across the roof to another building.

346
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,260
<13-5,GATES>发全境通告找她  派人去医院
<13-5,GATES>Get an APB out on her and get teams down to the hospital...

352
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:29,110
<13-11,TYSON>就是你眼里流露的痛
<13-11,TYSON>The pain in your eyes.

353
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,710
<13-11,TYSON>满是苦楚
<13-11,TYSON>The suffering.

354
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:34,880
<13-11,TYSON>还有恐惧  因为知道她就在我手里
<13-11,TYSON>And all that fear, knowing that I have her.

355
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:37,450
<13-12,CASTLE>如果你是冲我来的  那就带我走
<13-12,CASTLE>Well, if this is about me, then take me.

00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,390
<16-1,RYAN>技术部刚传来消息
<16-1,RYAN>We just heard from tech.

385
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,870
<16-1,RYAN>没有发现你的电话被篡改的证据
<16-1,RYAN>No evidence of anyone tampering with your phone.

386
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,790
<16-1,RYAN>他们觉得泰森找到了一个法子
<16-1,RYAN>They think that Tyson must have figured out a way

387
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,040
<16-1,RYAN>远程仿制了你的电话号码
<16-1,RYAN>to spoof your number from the outside.

388
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,230
<16-2,CASTLE>入室篡改还是远程控制  并不重要
<16-2,CASTLE>Inside, outside -- doesn't matter.

389
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:17,920
<16-2,CASTLE>他想让我知道他随时都能威胁到我
<16-2,CASTLE>He wants me to know he can get to me anytime.

390
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:20,900
<16-2,CASTLE>我很抱歉
<16-2,CASTLE>I'm sorry.

391
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,560
<16-3,RYAN>那晚在汽车旅馆我本有机会
<16-3,RYAN>I had him the night at the motel.

392
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:29,110
<16-3,RYAN>如果我动作能再快些
<16-3,RYAN>I-if I could have found a way to move a little faster,

393
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,210
<16-3,RYAN>反应再快一秒...
<16-3,RYAN>react a second sooner...

394
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,740
<16-4,CASTLE>这不是你的错
<16-4,CASTLE>It's not your fault.

395
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:33,810
<16-4,CASTLE>也是我的错
<16-4,CASTLE>It's not my fault.

396
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,080
<16-4,CASTLE>是他的错
<16-4,CASTLE>It's his fault.

397
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,980
<16-5,ESPOSITO>皇后区的警察刚看到了通缉的红色失窃货车
<16-5,ESPOSITO>Uniform in Queens just spotted that stolen red van off the APB.

398
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:40,760
<16-6,CASTLE>在哪儿
<16-6,CASTLE>Where?

399
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:42,860
<16-7,ESPOSITO>停在一个废弃工业设施的外面
<16-7,ESPOSITO>Parked outside of an abandoned industrial property.

400
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:44,130
<16-8,CASTLE>-她在那儿吗  -不知道
<16-8,CASTLE>- Is she there? - We don't know.

401
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,880
<16-9,ESPOSITO>但特警队正在赶去
<16-9,ESPOSITO>But an E.S.U. Team's on its way.

402
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:58,590
<16-9,ESPOSITO>我有发现  三楼
<16-9,ESPOSITO>I got something -- third floor.

403
00:16:58,870 --> 00:16:59,490
<16-9,ESPOSITO>是她
<16-9,ESPOSITO>It's her.

404
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,360
<16-9,ESPOSITO>人质已识别  在三楼东北角
<16-9,ESPOSITO>We have a positive I.D. -- third floor, northeast corner.

405
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:04,690
<17-1,ESPOSITO>-还有多少人  -不清楚  不在可视范围内
<17-1,ESPOSITO>- How many others? - Unknown. We don't have a visual.

406
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:07,600
<17-2,ESPOSITO>跟我们后面  如果他在里头  他会最先杀你
<17-2,ESPOSITO>Stay behind us. If he's in there, he's gonna gun for you first.

407
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:27,450
<17-2,ESPOSITO>卡塞尔  别动  退后  这是个陷阱
<17-2,ESPOSITO>Castle! Wait! Get back! It's a trap!

408
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,080
<18-1,BECKETT>小心
<18-1,BECKETT>Watch out!

409
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,580
<18-2,CASTLE>贝克特  不
<18-2,CASTLE>Beckett!! No!!

410
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,810
<19-1,CASTLE>天哪
<19-1,CASTLE>God!

411
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:49,230
<19-2,CASTLE>凯特  真抱歉
<19-2,CASTLE>Kate, I'm so sorry.

412
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,540
<19-3,CASTLE>抱歉
<19-3,CASTLE>I'm sorry.

413
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,210
<19-3,CASTLE>抱歉
<19-3,CASTLE>I'm sorry.

414
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,720
<19-3,CASTLE>我真
<19-3,CASTLE>I'm so--

415
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,390
<19-4,CASTLE>这不是她
<19-4,CASTLE>It's not her!

416
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,580
<19-4,CASTLE>不是她
<19-4,CASTLE>It's not her!

417
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,950
<20-1,CASTLE>那女孩是谁
<20-1,CASTLE>Who was the girl?

418
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:28,760
<20-2,RYAN>像其他人一样  以前是个吸毒者
<20-2,RYAN>Former drug addict, just like the others.

419
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:31,020
<20-2,RYAN>上周被报失踪
<20-2,RYAN>She was reported missing last week.

420
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:33,630
<20-2,RYAN>他们在椅子下面找到了一个扬声器
<20-2,RYAN>They found a speaker underneath the chair.

421
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,380
<20-2,RYAN>这样他能播放贝克特的声音
<20-2,RYAN>It's how he was able to broadcast Beckett's voice.

422
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:37,780
<20-3,CASTLE>武器呢
<20-3,CASTLE>And the weapon?

423
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:40,660
<20-4,RYAN>预先对准了被害人  远程触发
<20-4,RYAN>Pre-aimed at the victim, triggered remotely.

424
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,800
<20-5,CASTLE>他想让我们看着
<20-5,CASTLE>He wanted us to watch.

425
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:47,010
<20-5,CASTLE>他想让我们看着
<20-5,CASTLE>He wanted us to watch.

426
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,700
<20-6,RYAN>你觉得她还活着吗
<20-6,RYAN>You think she's still alive?

427
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,390
<20-7,CASTLE>她活着
<20-7,CASTLE>She's alive.

428
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:53,930
<20-8,RYAN>你怎么知道
<20-8,RYAN>How do you know?

429
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:56,950
<20-9,CASTLE>因为他和我的恩怨还没有了结
<20-9,CASTLE>Because he's not done with me yet.

430
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:19,810
<21-1,NIEMAN>好
<21-1,NIEMAN>Good.

431
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,470
<21-1,NIEMAN>你醒了
<21-1,NIEMAN>You're awake.

432
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,400
<21-1,NIEMAN>我们可以开始了
<21-1,NIEMAN>We can get started.

433
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,270
<21-1,NIEMAN>最近的被害人叫希德妮·诺瓦克
<21-1,NIEMAN>Our new victim's name is Sydney Novak,

434
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,090
<21-1,NIEMAN>来自佛罗里达州布劳沃德县
<21-1,NIEMAN>from Broward county, Florida.

435
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:31,580
<22-1,GATES>我们认为她被泰森和尼曼选中
<22-1,GATES>We believe she may have been targeted by Tyson and Nieman

436
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:33,800
<22-1,GATES>是因为她和贝克特警长的
<22-1,GATES>due to facial similarities

437
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:36,390
<22-1,GATES>脸部特征相似
<22-1,GATES>between her and detective Beckett.

438
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:38,550
<22-1,GATES>鉴于这些谋杀案的特性
<22-1,GATES>Given the nature of these murders...

439
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,220
<22-2,CASTLE>我们找不到她的
<22-2,CASTLE>We're not gonna find her.

440
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,470
<22-2,CASTLE>不能用这种方式
<22-2,CASTLE>Not like this.

441
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:47,070
<22-2,CASTLE>不能只是追逐他  按他的模式来
<22-2,CASTLE>Not by chasing him, not by playing his game.

442
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:51,450
<22-2,CASTLE>我们需要设局让他来玩
<22-2,CASTLE>We need to take the game to him.

443
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:08,480
<22-2,CASTLE>我认识你
<22-2,CASTLE>I know you.

444
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:10,430
<23-1,MARCUS GATES>你是那个作家
<23-1,MARCUS GATES>You're the writer.

445
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:13,560
<23-1,MARCUS GATES>是你和你的警察朋友把我关起来的
<23-1,MARCUS GATES>You and your cop friend put me in here.

446
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,590
<23-2,CASTLE>是因为你的狱友杰瑞·泰森
<23-2,CASTLE>For murders that your cellmate Jerry Tyson

447
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,130
<23-2,CASTLE>让你犯下的那些罪行
<23-2,CASTLE>convinced you to commit

448
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,410
<23-2,CASTLE>这样全世界都认为你是3XK
<23-2,CASTLE>so the world would think you were 3XK

449
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,140
<23-2,CASTLE>他就能逍遥法外了
<23-2,CASTLE>and he would get away scot-free.

450
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:24,510
<23-3,MARCUS GATES>你来这干什么
<23-3,MARCUS GATES>Why are you here?

451
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,130
<23-4,CASTLE>四年里你和他同住一间牢房
<23-4,CASTLE>You shared a cell with him for four years.

452
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:30,400
<23-5,MARCUS GATES>我宁愿忘记那几年
<23-5,MARCUS GATES>Time I'd rather forget.

453
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:31,420
<23-6,CASTLE>为什么
<23-6,CASTLE>Why?

454
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:36,160
<23-7,MARCUS GATES>你看着他会觉得  他太弱了
<23-7,MARCUS GATES>You look at him, you think..."he's so weak."

455
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:38,820
<23-7,MARCUS GATES>一无是处
<23-7,MARCUS GATES>There's nothing to him.

456
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:43,760
<23-7,MARCUS GATES>但他知道怎么掌控你
<23-7,MARCUS GATES>But the guy -- he knew how to get in your head.

457
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:47,180
<23-7,MARCUS GATES>他知道怎样让你做
<23-7,MARCUS GATES>He knew how to make you do things

458
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:48,970
<23-7,MARCUS GATES>你以为自己不会做的事
<23-7,MARCUS GATES>you never thought capable of.

459
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:50,380
<23-8,CASTLE>比如说帮他杀人吗
<23-8,CASTLE>Like killing for him?

460
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,660
<23-9,MARCUS GATES>我只想说  自从得知他的死讯
<23-9,MARCUS GATES>Let's just say I slept a lot better

461
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:57,470
<23-9,MARCUS GATES>我终于睡得安稳了
<23-9,MARCUS GATES>once I knew he was dead.

462
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:58,570
<23-9,MARCUS GATES>他没死
<23-9,MARCUS GATES>He's not.

463
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,730
<23-10,CASTLE>他只是消失了一阵
<23-10,CASTLE>Just another way for him to disappear

464
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,280
<23-10,CASTLE>计划新的行动
<23-10,CASTLE>so he could make his plans.

465
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,510
<23-11,MARCUS GATES>他还活着
<23-11,MARCUS GATES>He's alive?

466
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,910
<23-12,CASTLE>我妻子在他手上
<23-12,CASTLE>And he has my wife.

467
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,500
<23-12,CASTLE>你跟他同住一间牢房四年
<23-12,CASTLE>You shared a cell with him for four years.

468
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:11,700
<23-12,CASTLE>没人比你更了解他
<23-12,CASTLE>No one knows him better than you.

469
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:12,800
<23-12,CASTLE>四年中
<23-12,CASTLE>In all that time,

470
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:17,240
<23-12,CASTLE>他有没提过城里的某个地方
<23-12,CASTLE>did he ever mention a place somewhere in the city,

471
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:19,480
<23-12,CASTLE>能让他有安全感
<23-12,CASTLE>a place he would go to feel safe?

472
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:21,910
<23-13,MARCUS GATES>你需要我的帮助
<23-13,MARCUS GATES>You need my help.

473
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,750
<23-14,CASTLE>没错我需要你的帮助
<23-14,CASTLE>Yes, I need your help.

474
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:25,850
<23-15,MARCUS GATES>你把我关进大牢
<23-15,MARCUS GATES>You put me in here.

475
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,310
<23-15,MARCUS GATES>是他干的
<23-15,MARCUS GATES>He put you in here.

476
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:30,930
<23-16,CASTLE>是他让你做了那些事
<23-16,CASTLE>He got you to do those things.

477
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:35,390
<23-16,CASTLE>他看透了你  把你像傀儡一样控制
<23-16,CASTLE>He got inside your head, controlled you like a puppet.

478
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,190
<23-16,CASTLE>你已经付出代价了  但我们需要你来抓住他
<23-16,CASTLE>You'd done your time, but he needed you to get caught.

479
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:42,640
<23-16,CASTLE>你牺牲了自己
<23-16,CASTLE>You sacrificed yourself.

480
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:44,710
<23-16,CASTLE>我猜你每晚都会看到他的脸
<23-16,CASTLE>And I bet not a night goes by you don't see his face

481
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,850
<23-16,CASTLE>琢磨"他是怎么做到的
<23-16,CASTLE>and wonder, "How did he do that?

482
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,030
<23-16,CASTLE>他是怎么让我放弃自己生活的"
<23-16,CASTLE>How did he get me to throw my life away?"

483
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:55,960
<23-17,MARCUS GATES>他说过一个地方
<23-17,MARCUS GATES>There was some place he talked about --

484
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,170
<23-17,MARCUS GATES>一个他喜欢去的地方
<23-17,MARCUS GATES>a place he liked to go.

485
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,250
<23-18,CASTLE>在哪

00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,790
<23-21,MARCUS GATES>出狱
<23-21,MARCUS GATES>Out.

489
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,940
<23-22,CASTLE>你知道我没这权力
<23-22,CASTLE>You know I don't have the authority --

490
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,730
<23-23,MARCUS GATES>我确定凭借你的人脉
<23-23,MARCUS GATES>I'm sure with all your connections,

491
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,290
<23-23,MARCUS GATES>能找到可以放我出去的人
<23-23,MARCUS GATES>you can find someone who does.

492
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,820
<23-24,CASTLE>他们不会同意的
<23-24,CASTLE>They'll never go for it.

493
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:13,580
<23-24,CASTLE>他们不会释放谋杀犯  他们会让她去死
<23-24,CASTLE>Not gonna release a murderer. They'll let her die first.

494
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:14,940
<23-25,MARCUS GATES>这与我无关
<23-25,MARCUS GATES>That's not my problem.

00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:17,350
<23-25,MARCUS GATES>求你了
<23-25,MARCUS GATES>Please.

<23-27,MARCUS GATES>我没有家人  卡塞尔
<23-27,MARCUS GATES>I don't have a family, mr. Castle.

500
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,120
<23-27,MARCUS GATES>我余生都要在这度过
<23-27,MARCUS GATES>And I am stuck in here for life

501
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:30,870
<23-27,MARCUS GATES>也没有假释的可能
<23-27,MARCUS GATES>without the possibility of parole,

502
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,770
<23-27,MARCUS GATES>所以你觉得你能给我
<23-27,MARCUS GATES>so what the hell do you think you could give me

503
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,080
<23-27,MARCUS GATES>什么有价值的东西
<23-27,MARCUS GATES>that would be worth a damn?

504
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:39,780
<23-27,MARCUS GATES>复仇
<23-27,MARCUS GATES>Revenge.

505
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,260
<23-28,CASTLE>他在外面无拘无束  你却被关在这里
<23-28,CASTLE>He's out there, walking around, and you're in here.

506
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:47,550
<23-28,CASTLE>你不想报仇雪恨吗
<23-28,CASTLE>Don't you want to settle the score?

507
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:52,700
<23-29,CASTLE>我真没想到过了那么多年
<23-29,CASTLE>Fine. Guess I just didn't think, after all these years,

508
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:54,510
<23-29,CASTLE>你还是任他摆布
<23-29,CASTLE>you'd still let him control you.

509
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:02,420
<23-30,MARCUS GATES>怎么复仇
<23-30,MARCUS GATES>What kind of revenge?

510
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,210
<24-1,MARCUS GATES>他提过一个地方
<24-1,MARCUS GATES>There was a place he talked about --

511
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:11,360
<24-1,MARCUS GATES>树林里的一幢房子
<24-1,MARCUS GATES>A house in the woods.

512
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:12,590
<24-2,CASTLE>在哪
<24-2,CASTLE>Where?

513
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,980
<24-3,MARCUS GATES>在哈德逊河上游  房子是他家人朋友的
<24-3,MARCUS GATES>A little ways up the Hudson, owned by a family friend.

514
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:18,070
<24-3,MARCUS GATES>小时候  如果跟母亲关系紧张
<24-3,MARCUS GATES>When he was a kid, he'd go there in the summers

515
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,850
<24-3,MARCUS GATES>一到夏天他就会去那
<24-3,MARCUS GATES>when things got too intense with his mother.

<24-4,CASTLE>你好  你们有电子历史记录吗
<24-4,CASTLE>Hello. Are your archives digitized?

<24-4,CASTLE>以下地址的建筑平面图
<24-4,CASTLE>a set of the building plans for the following address.

00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:29,170
<24-5,MARCUS GATES>你救不了她
<24-5,MARCUS GATES>You know, you can't save her.

521
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,960
<24-5,MARCUS GATES>他一看到警察来
<24-5,MARCUS GATES>When he sees the cops coming --

522
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:35,810
<24-5,MARCUS GATES>相信我  他看得到
<24-5,MARCUS GATES>and, trust me, he will see the cops coming --

523
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,210
<24-5,MARCUS GATES>他不会讨价还价
<24-5,MARCUS GATES>he won't bargain.

524
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,490
<24-5,MARCUS GATES>不会讲道理
<24-5,MARCUS GATES>He won't be reasoned with.

<24-6,CASTLE>警察不会去
<24-6,CASTLE>It won't be the cops.

528
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,910
<24-7,CASTLE>去的人是我
<24-7,CASTLE>It'll be me.

00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:52,700
<25-1,CASTLE>艾米·巴瑞特
<25-1,CASTLE>Amy Barrett.

531
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:55,800
<25-1,CASTLE>你觉得巴瑞特与这事有关
<25-1,CASTLE>You think Barrett was involved in this?

532
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:57,260
<25-1,CASTLE>或者她也是受害者
<25-1,CASTLE>Or she's a victim, too.

533
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:01,610
<26-1,CASTLE>她的确在和他们合作
<26-1,CASTLE>So she was working with them.

<26-4,CASTLE>她在哪

<26-7,AMY>我不知道  他们没告诉我
<26-7,AMY>I don't know. They wouldn't tell me.

540
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,470
<26-7,AMY>一切结束后我才会知道
<26-7,AMY>Not until it's over.

541
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:22,680
<26-7,AMY>他们让我在这等着

<26-8,CASTLE>还有谁  谁在房子里
<26-8,CASTLE>Who's down there? Who's in the house?

544
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,610
<26-9,AMY>只有我
<26-9,AMY>Just me.

545
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:30,650
<26-10,CASTLE>你在撒谎
<26-10,CASTLE>You're lying.

546
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,040
<26-10,CASTLE>他们都在里面  对吧
<26-10,CASTLE>They're in there, aren't they?

547
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,300
<26-10,CASTLE>没在

<26-11,AMY>不信你带我回去看
<26-11,AMY>If you bring me back there, I'll show you.

549
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:41,080
<27-1,AMY>你在干什么
<27-1,AMY>What are you doing?

550
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:42,870
<27-2,CASTLE>确保你不妨碍我做事
<27-2,CASTLE>Making sure you stay out of my way.

551
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,660
<27-2,CASTLE>你知道我最喜欢这车哪点吗
<27-2,CASTLE>You know what I love about this car?

552
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:48,830
<27-2,CASTLE>它宽敞的后备箱
<27-2,CASTLE>All the trunk space.

553
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:49,960
<27-2,CASTLE>进去
<27-2,CASTLE>Get in.

554
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,010
<27-3,AMY>如果我说谎  他们真的在那
<27-3,AMY>If I'm lying and they are down there,

555
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:57,320
<27-3,AMY>他们会发现我不见了
<27-3,AMY>they're gonna miss me soon.

556

<27-3,AMY>他们会知道你在  会杀了你俩
<27-3,AMY>They'll know you're out here. They'll kill you both.

<28-1,NIEMAN>尽管落得如此下场  我还是很敬佩你
<28-1,NIEMAN>Despite the situation, I want you to know I admire you.

558
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,740
<28-1,NIEMAN>一直如此
<28-1,NIEMAN>I always have.

559
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:32,000
<28-2,NIEMAN>反抗是没有意义的  探长
<28-2,NIEMAN>There's no point in resisting, detective.

560
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:36,390
<28-2,NIEMAN>事实上  如果你接受  我把塞口物解开
<28-2,NIEMAN>If fact, if you accept that, I can remove the gag.

561
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:41,480
<28-2,NIEMAN>很好
<28-2,NIEMAN>Good.

562
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:44,620
<28-3,NIEMAN>别尖叫  没用
<28-3,NIEMAN>And please don't scream. It's tedious.

563
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:46,070
<28-3,NIEMAN>没人能听见
<28-3,NIEMAN>And no one can hear you.

564
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:51,150
<28-4,NIEMAN>好多了
<28-4,NIEMAN>Much better.

565
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:58,780
<29-1,NIEMAN>遮住这么美丽的脸庞简直是犯罪
<29-1,NIEMAN>It's a crime to cover up such a lovely face.

566
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:02,360
<29-2,BECKETT>绑架和谋杀才是犯罪
<29-2,BECKETT>Kidnapping and murder are crimes.

567
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:04,530
<29-2,BECKETT>你还可以自救
<29-2,BECKETT>You can still save yourself.

568
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:09,120
<29-3,NIEMAN>我已经被拯救了
<29-3,NIEMAN>I've already been saved.

569
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,500
<29-4,NIEMAN>我曾为内心真实的自我
<29-4,NIEMAN>I used to feel ashamed of who I was inside,

570
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,350
<29-4,NIEMAN>那些我想做的事情而感到羞耻
<29-4,NIEMAN>the things I dreamt about doing.

571
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,290
<29-4,NIEMAN>后来我遇见了杰瑞
<29-4,NIEMAN>And then I met Jerry,

572
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:23,090
<29-4,NIEMAN>那感觉就像是找到了归宿
<29-4,NIEMAN>And it was like... coming home.

573
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,910
<29-4,NIEMAN>如果你觉得我会背叛他
<29-4,NIEMAN>So if you think that I would ever turn on him,

574
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,330
<29-4,NIEMAN>你根本就不了解我
<29-4,NIEMAN>You don't understand me at all.

575
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:33,590
<29-4,NIEMAN>当你没有利用价值的时候
<29-4,NIEMAN>What do you think he's gonna do

576
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,270
<30-1,BECKETT>你认为他会怎么处置你
<30-1,BECKETT>when you're no longer useful to him?

577
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,600
<30-1,BECKETT>他会杀了你
<30-1,BECKETT>He will kill you.

578
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:41,740
<30-2,BECKETT>我是你唯一的机会  凯莉  我能帮你
<30-2,BECKETT>I am your only chance, Kelly. I can help you.

<30-3,NIEMAN>你马上就会帮到
<30-3,NIEMAN>And you're going to.

580
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,530
<30-4,BECKETT>你在干什么
<30-4,BECKETT>What are you doing?

581
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,910
<30-5,NIEMAN>警察盯上我们了  我需要一张新脸
<30-5,NIEMAN>With all the police attention, I'll need a new face.

582
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,310
<30-6,NIEMAN>我选了你的
<30-6,NIEMAN>And I've chosen yours.

583
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:03,300
<30-7,BECKETT>不

<30-7,BECKETT>求你了
<30-7,BECKETT>Please.

587

<30-8,NIEMAN>-还是给你戴上吧  -不要
<30-8,NIEMAN>- This is going back on. - No!

588
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,560
<31-1,CASTLE>她不在这
<31-1,CASTLE>She's not here.

00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:46,830
<31-3,TYSON>脸庞让我着迷
<31-3,TYSON>Faces fascinate me.

592
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,340
<32-1,NIEMAN>我们展现给世人的面具
<32-1,NIEMAN>The mask we show to the world.

593
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:56,610
<32-1,NIEMAN>我发现客户总是希望手术
<32-1,NIEMAN>I find that clients invariably hope

594
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,750
<32-1,NIEMAN>不但能改变外表
<32-1,NIEMAN>a procedure won't just change their looks,

595
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:02,780
<32-1,NIEMAN>还能改变他们内心的本质
<32-1,NIEMAN>but change who they are in some deeper way.

596
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:05,170
<32-1,NIEMAN>哪有那种事
<32-1,NIEMAN>Never does.

597
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:09,830
<32-1,NIEMAN>仅仅是粉刷房子
<32-1,NIEMAN>Any more than painting a house

598
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,470
<32-1,NIEMAN>怎能改变房子里发生的事情
<32-1,NIEMAN>can change the things that happen inside of it.

599
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:24,770
<32-1,NIEMAN>什么事

<33-1,TYSON>你从她身上拿到需要的东西了吗
<33-1,TYSON>Did you get what you need from her?

603
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:32,990
<33-2,NIEMAN>足够了
<33-2,NIEMAN>Enough.

604

<35-4,CASTLE>带我来
<35-4,CASTLE>Brought me?

616
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,200
<35-5,TYSON>你知道我最喜欢人类的哪一点吗
<35-5,TYSON>You know what I love about human beings?

617
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:33,750
<35-5,TYSON>他们可预知性太强  就像老鼠一样
<35-5,TYSON>Is they're so predictable. They're like mice.

618
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,500
<35-5,TYSON>你能让他们做任何事
<35-5,TYSON>You can get them to do anything.

619
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:37,600
<35-5,TYSON>你只需
<35-5,TYSON>All you have to do

620
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:40,040
<35-5,TYSON>在迷宫尽头放一小块芝士
<35-5,TYSON>is put a little cheese at the end of the maze

621
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:43,000
<35-5,TYSON>知道什么时候惊吓它们就行
<35-5,TYSON>and know exactly when to shock them.

622
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,500
<35-6,CASTLE>你知道我会来
<35-6,CASTLE>You knew I was coming.

623
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:46,780
<35-7,TYSON>以布德罗身份  在你面前晃悠
<35-7,TYSON>Dangling Boudreau in front of you,

624
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:50,290
<35-7,TYSON>眼看贝克特在眼前死去
<35-7,TYSON>watching Beckett die before your eyes --

625
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:53,390
<35-7,TYSON>当我把警察玩得团团转之时
<35-7,TYSON>Once I had the cops chasing their tails,

626
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,780
<35-7,TYSON>我知道你决定自己出手
<35-7,TYSON>I knew it'd be only a matter of time

627
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:56,790
<35-7,TYSON>只是时间问题
<35-7,TYSON>before you did something on your own.

628
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,570
<35-7,TYSON>拜访我的狱友
<35-7,TYSON>Visiting my old cellie was a --

629
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,190
<35-7,TYSON>是很合乎情理的选择
<35-7,TYSON>well, that was a natural choice.

630
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,740
<35-8,CASTLE>这是个圈套
<35-8,CASTLE>This was a setup.

631
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:07,520
<35-9,TYSON>把你单独引来的最好方法
<35-9,TYSON>What better way to get you here alone

632
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,950
<35-9,TYSON>就是让你以为你是自己找来的
<35-9,TYSON>than to make you think it was your idea?

633
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:12,750
<35-9,TYSON>为什么
<35-9,TYSON>Why?

634
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:14,770
<35-10,CASTLE>你为什么要这么做
<35-10,CASTLE>Why are you doing this to me?

635
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:16,310
<35-11,TYSON>因为我想看着你的脸
<35-11,TYSON>Because I want to see your face.

636
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,890
<35-11,TYSON>所以我才会把你引到这
<35-11,TYSON>It's why I lured you here --

637
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:21,450
<35-11,TYSON>这样我就能在她死掉时
<35-11,TYSON>so I could see your face...

638
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,970
<35-11,TYSON>欣赏你脸上的表情
<35-11,TYSON>while you watched her die.

639
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:26,620
<35-11,TYSON>不
<35-11,TYSON>No.

640
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,700
<35-12,CASTLE>不是因为这个
<35-12,CASTLE>That's not it.

641
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,880
<35-14,CASTLE>这跟我无关  对吧
<35-14,CASTLE>This isn't about me, is it?

642
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:40,180
<35-14,CASTLE>远不止这么简单
<35-14,CASTLE>Oh, it's about so much more than that.

643
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:43,020
<35-14,CASTLE>这跟你有关
<35-14,CASTLE>This is about you.

644
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,890
<35-14,CASTLE>你的弱点
<35-14,CASTLE>Your inadequacy.

645
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:49,920
<35-14,CASTLE>所有的游戏  所有的摆布
<35-14,CASTLE>All the games, all the manipulation...

646
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:52,750
<35-14,CASTLE>在我毁掉了你的计划之后
<35-14,CASTLE>After I screwed up your plans,

647
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:56,390
<35-14,CASTLE>你需要证明你比我聪明
<35-14,CASTLE>you needed to prove you were smarter than me.

648
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,850
<35-14,CASTLE>你要知道你能控制我
<35-14,CASTLE>You needed to know you could control me.

649
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:07,090
<35-15,TYSON>可你来了啊
<35-15,TYSON>Well, you're here.

650
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:09,950
<35-16,CASTLE>我写过你这样的角色
<35-16,CASTLE>You know, I've written characters like you.

651
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,240
<35-16,CASTLE>机智的反社会主义者  如此自恋
<35-16,CASTLE>Cunning psychopaths so narcissistic,

652
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:14,020
<35-16,CASTLE>他们认为自己不会被抓
<35-16,CASTLE>they believe they can't be caught -

653
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:16,910
<35-16,CASTLE>因为他们比别人聪明
<35-16,CASTLE>Because they're smarter than everyone

654
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,960
<35-16,CASTLE>他们还需要证明这一点
<35-16,CASTLE>and they need to prove it.

655
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:22,570
<35-16,CASTLE>那是你的故事  杰瑞
<35-16,CASTLE>That's your story, Jerry.

656
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,890
<35-16,CASTLE>你所作所为的原因
<35-16,CASTLE>Why you did everything.

657
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:28,210
<35-16,CASTLE>你要证明这一切
<35-16,CASTLE>You needed to prove it.

658
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,090
<35-18,CASTLE>于是我就让你得手了
<35-18,CASTLE>So I let you.

659
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,200
<35-17,TYSON>你什么意思
<35-17,TYSON>What do you mean?

660
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:40,100
<35-18,CASTLE>我任由你把我引到这里
<35-18,CASTLE>I let you bring me here.

661
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:42,450
<35-18,CASTLE>这是找到你的唯一方法
<35-18,CASTLE>It's the only way to find you.

662
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:46,610
<35-18,CASTLE>我找到你才能找到她
<35-18,CASTLE>I needed to find you so I could find her.

00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:48,980
<35-18,CASTLE>但事实是  杰瑞
<35-18,CASTLE>But the truth, Jerry...

664
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:53,550
<35-18,CASTLE>我们找不到她的  不能用这种方式
<35-18,CASTLE>We're not gonna find her -- not like this.

665
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:57,380
<35-18,CASTLE>不能只是追逐他  按他的模式来
<35-18,CASTLE>Not by chasing him, not by playing his game.

666
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,040
<36-1,CASTLE>我们需要设局让他来玩
<36-1,CASTLE>We need to take the game to him.

667
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:07,850
<36-2,ESPOSITO>把这个放进耳朵深处
<36-2,ESPOSITO>Put this deep in your ear.

668
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:09,100
<36-2,ESPOSITO>全放进去
<36-2,ESPOSITO>All right? All the way in.

669
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:12,040
<37-1,CASTLE>事实是
<37-1,CASTLE>The truth is...

670
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:15,120
<37-1,CASTLE>我引你来这
<37-1,CASTLE>I lured you here...

671
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:18,000
<37-1,CASTLE>看你死
<37-1,CASTLE>to watch you die.

672
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,360
<37-1,CASTLE>清楚了吗[准备好了吗]
<37-1,CASTLE>Are we clear?

673
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:23,710
<37-2,TYSON>清楚什么
<37-2,TYSON>Clear about what?

674
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,670
<37-3,CASTLE>那就开枪吧
<37-3,CASTLE>Then take the shot.
