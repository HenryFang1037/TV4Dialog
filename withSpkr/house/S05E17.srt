170
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:12,740

<6-16,Thirteen>He didn't call me attractive.abcHe cast me in his mental porno.

173
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:20,630
<6-17,Foreman>这正是迷人的定义abc就是说"你让我想入非非"
<6-17,Foreman>That's what attractive means. Itabcmeans "I'm attracted to you, sexually."

174
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,620

<6-19,Foreman>It could. It never does. It's whatabcwomen choose to hear,not what men say.

177
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,170
<6-20,Thirteen>实际上 稍微有点脑子的男人都会这么想
<6-20,Thirteen>Actually,it's exactly what menabcsay if they have any brains.

178
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,260
<6-21,Thirteen>好了 基线扫描可以了
<6-21,Thirteen>All right, we have enough for a baseline.

<6-25,Nick>Wrong. I secretly don't vote. Ever.

185
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:59,480
<6-26,Thirteen>慢着 你46岁了 却从未投过票?
<6-26,Thirteen>Wait, you're 46,and you've never voted?

186
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,900
<6-27,Nick>当你用这种苛责的语调时abc你的声线变得不再迷人
<6-27,Nick>Your voice isno longer attractiveabcto me with that note of disapproval.

00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,820
<6-27,Nick>但我相信会过去的
<6-27,Nick>Although I'm sure that will pass.

188
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:08,830
<6-28,Foreman>你看 扣带回有一点没有发亮
<6-28,Foreman>Look at that. There's a spot in theabccingulategyrus that's not lighting up.

189
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,510
<6-29,Nick>少了你这一票有什么分别?
<6-29,Nick>One vote makes a difference?

<6-30,Thirteen>We can't biopsy that. It'sabctoo close to the brainstem.

192
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:17,410
<6-31,Foreman>可能是神经系统结节病abc至少是可治愈的
<6-31,Foreman>Could be neurosarcoidosis.abcAt least it's treatable.

<7-14,House>Or what they think are insults.

213
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:29,790
<7-15,Wilson>那么说 这还不算侮辱?
<7-15,Wilson>So that wasn't an insult?

214
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:33,560
<7-16,House>我不是说 你和我们的病人一样abc表面上 逼着自己对别人友善

<19-4,Wilson>Maybe you just don't have a goodabcstatistical samplin of my walks.

498
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:59,940
<19-11,House>为什么会选这个?
<19-11,House>Why would someone choose that?

499
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:03,430
<19-11,House>因为恨自己?
<19-11,House>Because they hate themselves?

<19-12,Wilson>有没想过你不知道的事并不意味挑战?
<19-12,Wilson>Has it ever occurred to you that when don't shareabcsomething, it might notbe meant as a challenge?

<20-5,Nick>To what? A life where I'll continually driveabcaway anyone who might for a second care about me?

552
00:30:57,330 --> 00:31:01,640
<22-6,Wilson>我不告诉你大概是因为你总能猜中
<22-6,Wilson>Maybe the reason I don't always openabcup to you is because it's redundant.

553
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:04,240
<22-7,House>Daniel wilson.

<22-8,Wilson>这几天他都在服药
<22-8,Wilson>He's been on them for a couple of days.

<22-11,House>Why wouldn't you tell me this?

<22-12,Wilson>House 我们...
<22-12,Wilson>House, you and I...

<22-12,Wilson>we don't have the normal social contract.

566
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:46,850
<22-12,Wilson>我得不到你的好言相慰
<22-12,Wilson>I don't expect you toabctell me the lies--

<22-14,Wilson>我是指心知肚明的谎言
<22-14,Wilson>I mean, collaborative lies.

570
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:57,920
<22-14,Wilson>当有人需要被骗时 就帮帮他吧
<22-14,Wilson>Giving someone a hand who maybe needs toabcdeceive themselves just a little.

571
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:03,590
<22-14,Wilson>这两天我一直在想abcDanny看到我会有什么反应
<22-14,Wilson>For two days I've been thinking aboutabchow danny's gonna react when he sees me.

572
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:06,410
<22-14,Wilson>如果我向别人诉说 他们都会说
<22-14,Wilson>If I said that toabcanybody else,they'd say,

<22-14,Wilson>"别担心 一切都会好起来的"
<22-14,Wilson>"don't worry.It'll all be all right."

<22-14,Wilson>You wodn't.

575
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:14,230
<22-15,House>因为事实极有可能与之相反
<22-15,House>Because it might all go horribly wrong.

576
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:19,010
<22-16,Wilson>对

<22-16,Wilson>Yeah, it might.

578
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:26,060

<23-4,Nick>我冒了生命危险动手术abc也许她就能少点怨气 让我轻松一阵
<23-4,Nick>Maybe she'll stop whining and cut meabcsome slack now that I've risked my life.

587
00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:09,520
<23-5,Foreman>这不对 病灶已经切除
<23-5,Foreman>Doesn't make sense.abcWe removed the problem.

588
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:12,340
<23-6,Taub>我们是切除了病灶abc也许诊断错了
<23-6,Taub>We removed the damage. Maybeabcwe were wrong about the problem.

593
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:23,870
<23-11,Taub>这可能是手术造成的
<23-11,Taub>It could be the effect of the surgery.

594
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:27,420
<23-12,Audrey>Nick 难道你一点也不尊重我abc你认同我的工作吗?
<23-12,Audrey>Do you at least respect me,nick whatabcdo you think of what I do for a living?

595
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:31,120
<23-13,Nick>我觉得那些宣称自己了不得的人
<23-13,Nick>I think people whoabcpublice important things are people

596
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:33,860

<23-21,Nick>等等 听我说--
<23-21,Nick>Aud,abcwait.Let me--

603

605
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,630
<24-1,Foreman>心电图显示心脏很正常
<24-1,Foreman>Echo says his heart is structurally fine.

606
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:06,260
<24-1,Foreman>可他的体温一直在降
<24-1,Foreman>But his temperature is still dropping.

607
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,480
<24-1,Foreman>体温很快就会过低
<24-1,Foreman>He's headed for hypothermia.

608

<24-2,Taub>House不接电话 转到语音留言去了
<24-2,Taub>I can't reach house. Itabcjust goes to voicemail.

609
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:11,110
<24-3,Thirteen>就是说他不是感染咯
<24-3,Thirteen>It means we were wrong about infection.

610
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:14,410
<24-3,Thirteen>体温忽高忽低abc说明他的体温调节点出事了
<24-3,Thirteen>His temperature's just going up and downabcbecause something's playing with his thermostat.

611
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:16,130
<24-4,Kutner>也就是说大脑病变扩散了
<24-4,Kutner>Which means the brainabcdamage is spreading.

612
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:19,540
<24-5,Foreman>什么会同时引起大脑受损 流鼻血abc还有肺 心脏及肾的病变?

00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:27,750
<24-7,Foreman>做个全身的扫描吧
<24-7,Foreman>Do a full body scan.

616
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:29,090
<24-8,Kutner>House最恨全身扫描
<24-8,Kutner>House hates full body scans.

<24-9,Foreman>- House不在abc- House是对的
<24-9,Foreman>- House isn't here.abc- House is right.

618
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:34,170
<24-10,Taub>人人做全身扫描都会发现一些异常
<24-10,Taub>Everybody's got three or four meaninglessabcanomalies that'll come up on a scan.

619
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,300
<24-10,Taub>揪着这些不放只会浪费时间
<24-10,Taub>Chasing each one willabctake time we don't have.

620
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:38,590
<24-11,Foreman>想通后就给他做个全身扫描
<24-11,Foreman>Feel free to send him an im.

621
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:26,240
<25-1,House>你说你有一次见过你弟弟
<25-1,House>You told me you saw your brother once.

622
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:27,870
<25-1,House>在他失踪后
<25-1,House>After he disappeared.

623
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:29,780
<25-2,Wilson>13年前
<25-2,Wilson>13 years ago.

624
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:32,030
<25-2,Wilson>我曾经疯了似的去普林斯顿
<25-2,Wilson>I used to go toabcprinceton whenever I could.

625
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:34,690
<25-2,Wilson>把每个收容所都找遍了
<25-2,Wilson>I must have hit everyabchomeless shelter in town.

626
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:37,150
<25-2,Wilson>然后有一天我在餐厅吃三明治
<25-2,Wilson>And then one day,I'm just sittingabcat this deli, having a sandwich,

627
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:40,280
<25-2,Wilson>我发现他站在窗外
<25-2,Wilson>I look out the window, and there he is.

628
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:43,300
<25-2,Wilson>出去时他已经走了
<25-2,Wilson>He was gone by the time I got outside.

629
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:46,700
<25-3,House>所以当我告诉你abc普里斯顿医院招人你立刻就来了
<25-3,House>That's why you wereo eager when Iabctold you there was a job at princeton.

630
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:49,150
<25-3,House>还以为是因为我呢
<25-3,House>I thought it was just my charm.

631
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,200
<25-4,Wilson>小鸭子的电话 不接吗?
<25-4,Wilson>That's the team. Shouldn't you answer?

632
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:55,450
<25-5,House>他们发来短信 说他们又去干蠢事了
<25-5,House>They already texted me toabcs they're doing something stupid.

633
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,260
<26-1,Foreman>腹部有个很小的动脉瘤
<26-1,Foreman>There's a small abdominal eurysm.

634
00:35:58,270 --> 00:35:59,560
<26-2,Taub>这不相关 还有什么?
<26-2,Taub>Irrelevant. What else you got?

635
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:01,610
<26-3,Kutner>脏胸膜有个囊肿
<26-3,Kutner>Cyst in the pleura around the lungs.

636
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:03,710
<26-4,Thirteen>也不相关 不会导致症状
<26-4,Thirteen>Also irrelevant. Couldn'tabccause any of the sympts.

637
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,900
<26-5,Foreman>肝脏有个高密度点abc可能是个血管畸形
<26-5,Foreman>There's a density in the liver.abcCould be vascular malformation.

638
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:09,820
<26-6,Taub>如果是多发性动静脉畸形abc血流增多就能引起这些症状
<26-6,Taub>If he's got multiple avms, screwed-upabcblood flow would explain erything.

639
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,760
<26-7,Foreman>只有做血管造影确诊了
<26-7,Foreman>We can only spot them with angiography.

640
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,540
<26-7,Foreman>做对照靶扫描 把病点栓塞了
<26-7,Foreman>We'll have to do targeted scans withabccontrast and then embolize each one.

641
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:15,890
<26-8,Taub>能赶在他体温过低前完成吗?
<26-8,Taub>Can we do that before he freezes?

642
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,690
<26-9,Kutner>试试吧
<26-9,Kutner>We'll find out.

643
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:23,250
<26-10,House>Kutner手机的拼写检查器自作聪明
<26-10,House>The spell-correct on kutner'sabcphone has got a hair trigger.

644
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:28,500
<26-10,House>要不然 就是病人的花花肺里刮起了龙卷风
<26-10,House>Either that, or the patient has aabccyclone in the floral of his lungs.

645
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:35,320
<26-10,House>你不穿大衣abc在45度(7摄氏°)的天气外出散步
<26-10,House>You took a walk in 45-degree weather,abcand you left your coat behind.

646
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,250
<26-11,Wilson>继续说
<26-11,Wilson>Go ahead.

647
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,750
<26-12,House>我觉得你是在自我惩罚
<26-12,House>I think you were punishing yourself.

648

<26-12,House>你想体验一下在新泽西的冬天abc无家可归的感觉
<26-12,House>I think you wanted to feel what it wouldabcbe like be homeless a new jersey winter.

649
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:50,390
<26-12,House>这说明你很内疚
<26-12,House>That tells me guilt.

650
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,370
<26-12,House>我猜你肯定出了什么事
<26-12,House>That tells me something happened.

651
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:58,190
<26-13,Wilson>他十几岁就患上精神分裂症
<26-13,Wilson>The schizophreniaabcstarted when he was a teenager.

<26-13,Wilson>When he was in college.

653
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:05,430
<26-13,Wilson>他有服药 但他还是觉得考试得Babc教授会不放过他
<26-13,Wilson>He was on meds,but he'd still think aabcprofessor was out to get him because he got a b,

654
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:07,780
<26-13,Wilson>他从不洗澡 所以和舍友吵架
<26-13,Wilson>or he'd fight with hisabcroommates because he never showered.

655
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:10,100
<26-14,House>- 你那时在哪?abc- 医学院
<26-14,House>- Where were you?abc- Med school.

656
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:16,300
<26-15,Wilson>他每天都打电话给我abc一说就是数小时
<26-15,Wilson>He called me everyabcday. Talked for hours.

657
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:18,350
<26-15,Wilson>我哪有时间
<26-15,Wilson>I didn't have hours.

658
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,570
<26-16,House>有趣
<26-16,House>Interesting.

659
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,620
<26-16,House>迟点再说这个 你继续
<26-16,House>Later for that. Go on.

660
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:28,050
<26-17,Wilson>我受够了每个人都把我当知心姐姐abc所以一天当他打电话来--
<26-17,Wilson>I was tiredof being the guy that everybodyabccounted on,so one night, danny called--

661
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:33,240
<26-17,Wilson>那晚 他在电话里哭着抱怨什么
<26-17,Wilson>one night, danny called,crying,abcupset about something.

662
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:34,750
<26-17,Wilson>可我必须准备考试
<26-17,Wilson>I had to study for an exam.

663
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:38,550
<26-17,Wilson>所以我挂了他的电话...
<26-17,Wilson>So I-I hung up...

664
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:42,260
<26-17,Wilson>拿上东西去了图书馆abc我不想再听到电话响
<26-17,Wilson>ok my things. I went to the library  soabcI wouldn't have to hear the phone ring.

665
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:44,970
<26-18,House>后来怎么样
<26-18,House>I wonderhow that turned out.

666
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:46,190
<26-19,Wilson>第二天我妈打来电话
<26-19,Wilson>My mother called me the next day.

667
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:48,570
<26-19,Wilson>Danny离家出走了 没有带药
<26-19,Wilson>Danny had run away andabcleft his meds behind.

668
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:54,040
<26-19,Wilson>所以我知道他根本没有能力回来
<26-19,Wilson>Which I knew meant that he wouldabcnever be able to choose to come back,

669
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:58,230
<26-19,Wilson>因为他不能融入现实社会
<26-19,Wilson>because he'd be so detached from reality.

670
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:02,350
<26-20,House>你在大学里 尝试过一次abc做个正常的自私鬼
<26-20,House>So you made your one effort toabclive a normal, selfish life,

671
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,850
<26-20,House>就马上被天打雷劈
<26-20,House>and the universeabcimmediately smacked you down.

672
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:08,360
<26-20,House>我们总是倾向于在随机事件里找规律
<26-20,House>Anbecause we're wired to findabcmeaning in semi-random events,

673
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:11,600
<26-20,House>所以你决定永远不再犯同样的错
<26-20,House>you decided never toabcbe that careless again.

674
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:14,930
<26-21,Wilson>你不觉得这是自然而然的吗?
<26-21,Wilson>You don't think that's a little facile?

675
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,690
<26-22,House>我不觉得
<26-22,House>Actually, I don't.

676
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:19,010
<26-22,House>你是刻意这么做
<26-22,House>I think you did it consciously.

677
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:25,710
<26-22,House>你就像奥运会运动员训练似的abc把自己塑造成好好先生
<26-22,House>You developed your people-pleasing talents theabcway an olympic athlete develops his muscles.

678
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:29,010
<26-22,House>你对偶发事件反应过度了
<26-22,House>Talk about an overreaction toabca single event.

679
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,040
<26-23,Wilson>但事态很严重
<26-23,Wilson>It was a pretty big event.

680
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,520
<26-24,House>挂电话?
<26-24,House>Hanging up the phone?

681
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,320
<26-24,House>这就是你不断自责的原因
<26-24,House>That's what you're blaming all this on.

682
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:37,180
<26-24,House>是你拼命想纠正的行为
<26-24,House>That's the behavior you'veabcbeen trying to correct.

683
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:40,680
<26-24,House>好像你弟弟除此以外没别的困扰
<26-24,House>As though nothing elseabcwent wrong in your brother'life.

684
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:44,000
<26-24,House>当然他也反应过度了 可是...
<26-24,House>Of course,he overreacted too but...

685
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:48,830
<26-24,House>血糖是正常的
<26-24,House>his glucose was normal.

686
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:51,740
<26-25,Wilson>我们不是在说我弟弟了 是吗?
<26-25,Wilson>We're not talking about myabcbrother anymore, are we?

687
00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:00,290
<26-26,House>我是House 动静脉畸形解释不了血糖
<26-26,House>It's house. Adms don'tabcexplain his glucose.

688
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:03,550
<26-27,Wilson>这是我人生中至关重要的一刻...
<26-27,Wilson>Since this is significant momentabcin my life and all...

689
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:06,330
<26-29,Wilson>- 没错abc- 我就要进去了
<26-29,Wilson>- Yeah.abc- I think I'll just go in then.

690
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:08,680
<26-30,House>- 说详细点abc- 没错
<26-30,House>- Explain that.abc- Right.

691
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:13,160
<26-32,House>你给他用了类固醇abc血糖应该会升高
<26-32,House>You'd given him steroids. Hisabcglucose should have been elevated.

692
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:16,490
<26-32,House>那可能是全身扫描发现的囊肿引起的
<26-32,House>That wannabe cyst youabcfound in the whole body scan,

693
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:18,280
<26-32,House>撇开血糖 那只是个囊肿
<26-32,House>without the glucose,it'sabcan irrelevant cyst.

694
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:20,960
<26-32,House>可和血糖挂上 那就是个纤维瘤
<26-32,House>With the glucose,it'sabca relevant fibroma.

695
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:22,920
<26-32,House>他有doege-potter综合症abc(纤维瘤引起的低血糖症)
<26-32,House>He has doege-potter syndrome.

696
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:28,300
<26-33,Kutner>纤维瘤分泌生长激素abc就像胰岛素 起降血糖作用
<26-33,Kutner>His fibroma is secreting human growth hormone,abcwhich acts like insulin,wering his glucose.

697
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:31,120
<26-34,Foreman>可解释不了器官功能失调及大脑病变
<26-34,Foreman>It doesn't explain theabcorgan failure orhe brain damage.

698
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:33,640
<26-35,House>这是机体的过度反应
<26-35,House>This whole thing is an overreaction.

699
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:35,950
<26-35,House>小小的纤维瘤
<26-35,House>That one small fibroma.

700
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:39,370
<26-35,House>尽管是良性的abc但机体把它当成入侵者了
<26-35,House>It's benign, but hisabcby'sacting like it's an invader.

701
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:43,820
<26-35,House>抗体开始攻击它abc同时也攻击其他系统
<26-35,House>His antibodies went to war against it andabcgot carried away,attack his other systems.

702
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:48,730
<26-35,House>切除纤维瘤abc他很快就会回复那个开心的伪君子
<26-35,House>Take out the froma, he'll be aabchappy hypocrite again in no time.

703
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:57,940
<27-1,Nick>可能我需要叫出租车
<27-1,Nick>Maybe I should call a cab.

704
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:00,870
<27-2,Taub>- 你妻子可能只是迟了点abc- 或许
<27-2,Taub>- Your wife's probably just late.abc- Yeah.

<27-4,Taub>我的鼻子很大
<27-4,Taub>I have a copicuous nose.

708
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:18,900
<27-5,Nick>但和你的脸很配
<27-5,Nick>It suits your face.

<27-6,Audrey>I was gonna tell you,andabcthen you got sick.

712
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,750
<27-6,Audrey>时机不对
<27-6,Audrey>It didn't seem like the best time.

713
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,900
<27-6,Audrey>我升职了
<27-6,Audrey>I've been offered a better position.

<27-9,Nick>Is marika okay?

719
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:06,150
<27-10,Audrey>她不生气了
<27-10,Audrey>I'm sure she's moved on.

720
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:13,930
<27-10,Audrey>小孩总是比较容易恢复的
<27-10,Audrey>Kids are so resilient.

<28-6,Wilson>继续说
<28-6,Wilson>Go on.

725
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:49,180
<28-4,Wilson>我以为再次见到他会改变许多事
<28-4,Wilson>I thought seeing himabcagain would change everything.

726
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:51,270
<28-4,Wilson>也许是好事 也可能是坏事
<28-4,Wilson>It would be wonderful or terrible.

727
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:55,740
<28-4,Wilson>可... 我们就像陌生人
<28-4,Wilson>Instead... we're just strangers.

728
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:59,170
<28-4,Wilson>这好像有点虎头蛇尾
<28-4,Wilson>It's kind of anticlimactic.

729
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:02,130
<28-5,House>总比坏事强吧
<28-5,House>Which is better than terrible.

730
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:08,720
<28-6,Wilson>继续说
<28-6,Wilson>Go on.

731
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:12,740
<28-7,House>我们之间没有社会契约abc你会不会觉得很困惑?
<28-7,House>Does it bother you thatabcwhave no social contract?

732
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:15,770
<28-8,Wilson>我一生都在妥协
<28-8,Wilson>My whole life is one big compromise.

733
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,190
<28-8,Wilson>我小心翼翼 仿佛别人都是瓷做的
<28-8,Wilson>I tiptoe around everyone likeabcthey're made of china.

734
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:21,400
<28-8,Wilson>我一直在琢磨:abc如果我这么说会不会有什么后果?
<28-8,Wilson>I spend all my time analyzing: Whatabcwill the effect be if I say this?

735
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,970
<28-8,Wilson>然后你出现了abc你这个愤世嫉俗的家伙.
<28-8,Wilson>Then there's you.abcYou're a reality junkie.

736
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:28,210
<28-8,Wilson>如果我说善意的谎言 你反而会倒打一耙
<28-8,Wilson>If I offered you a comforting lie,abcyou'd smack me over the head with it.

737
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:30,920
<28-8,Wilson>这样还不差
<28-8,Wilson>Let's not change that.

738
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:32,830
<28-8,Wilson>好啊
<28-8,Wilson>Kay.

739
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:37,600
<28-10,Wilson>不 如果你依照正常的社交规矩
<28-10,Wilson>No, see, this-- if you wereabcimplementing the social contract,

740
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:41,750
<28-10,Wilson>你这么说 只是因为...
<28-10,Wilson>you'd say that, but only because...

741
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:44,450
<28-10,Wilson>你想我好过些...
<28-10,Wilson>it makes me feel better...

00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:48,930
<28-11,House>看着你自相矛盾abc真是太逗了
<28-11,House>It is kind of fun watchingabcyou torture yourself.

<28-12,Wilson>- 你觉得我和我弟的关系会有改善吗?abc- 不觉得
<28-12,Wilson>- Do you think things will work out with my brother?abc- No.

<28-13,House>就算事情弄砸了 也不是你的错
<28-13,House>But when it does go wrong,abcit won't be your fault.
