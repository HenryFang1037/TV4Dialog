<2-8,House>花点跟我一样多的时间跟真人在一起
<2-8,House>Spend as much time around the real people as I do,

65
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:36,280
<2-8,House>会有人生病的
<2-8,House>someone gets sick.

00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,860
<2-9,Foreman>血小板89
<2-9,Foreman>Platelets are 89.

67
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,400
<2-9,Foreman>她贫血
<2-9,Foreman>She's anemic.

68

<2-9,Foreman>而且她血液酒精浓度是1.3

00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:43,910
<2-10,Chase>火辣的赌马宝贝?
<2-10,Chase>Hot otb babe?

70
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,330
<2-10,Chase>显然是个妓女
<2-10,Chase>Obviously a working girl.

71
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:47,210
<2-10,Chase>没准是站街的，感染
<2-10,Chase>Probably an std,infection.

00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,030
<2-11,House>不发热，没感染
<2-11,House>No fever,no infection.

73
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,880
<2-12,Foreman>酒精滥用可以解释
<2-12,Foreman>Alcohol abuse explains it all.

74
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,690
<2-12,Foreman>导致抽搐并影响她血液的凝结能力
<2-12,Foreman>Causes seizures and affects her blood's ability to clot,

75
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,020
<2-12,Foreman>从而导致瘀伤
<2-12,Foreman>which causes bruising.

76
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:56,780
<2-12,Foreman>给她一点肝磷脂，早晨就没事了
<2-12,Foreman>Start her on heparin. She'll be fine by morning.

77
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,640
<2-13,House>但是她的瘀伤并没有斑点
<2-13,House>Except for the fact that the bruises are not petechial,

78
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:00,120
<2-13,House>所以不是dic
<2-13,House>which means it's not dic.

79
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,150
<2-14,Foreman>那瘀伤就是由外伤造成的
<2-14,Foreman>So the bruises were caused by trauma.

80
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:05,080
<2-14,Foreman>她也许被她男朋友痛打 或是批条客
<2-14,Foreman>She probably got beat up by her boyfriend. Or her pimp.

81
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:08,390
<2-15,House>未见其人先行评价叫什么来着？
<2-15,House>What's that called when you judge someone before ever meeting them?

<2-16,Foreman>她是场外赌博的常客
<2-16,Foreman>She's a regular at otb.

83
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:14,560
<2-16,Foreman>反正不觉得她是朝九晚五族 家庭主妇族
<2-16,Foreman>Somehow I don't see her holding down a nine-to-five and going to pta meetings.

84
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,560
<2-17,House>我在场
<2-17,House>I was there.

85

<2-17,House>我有个朝九晚三的工作
<2-17,House>I have a "nine-to-three" job.

86
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:20,350
<2-18,Cameron>可能是sle家族毛细血管扩张症
<2-18,Cameron>it could be sle,familial telangiectasis,

87
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,550
<2-18,Cameron>甚至是库辛症
<2-18,Cameron>or even cushing'S.

88
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,210
<2-19,House>好，由这些入手吧
<2-19,House>Good. Start with those.

89
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,760
<2-20,Cameron>－哪一个？－库辛症
<2-20,Cameron>- Which one? - Cushing'S.

90
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:26,470
<2-21,House>可以解释抽搐和瘀伤
<2-21,House>Explains the seizure and the bruising.

91
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,540
<2-22,Foreman>但不能解释贫血
<2-22,Foreman>Not the anemia.

92
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,930
<2-23,House>她没吃很多肉
<2-23,House>So she doesn't eat a lot of meat.

93
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,940
<2-24,Foreman>酗酒导致Dic更贴切
<2-24,Foreman>Dic brought on by alcohol abuse is far more likely.

94
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,180
<2-24,Foreman>做全套检查吧
<2-24,Foreman>Do a full workup.

97
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,390
<2-24,Foreman>哇……
<2-24,Foreman>Whoa!

98
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:44,020
<2-25,House>你刚才是明确下令 让我去找她的医疗记录么?
<2-25,House>Did you just ever-so-subtly order me to get her medical history?

99
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:46,890
<2-26,Foreman>卡迪上周起让我负责了，所以……
<2-26,Foreman>Cuddy put me in charge last week. So...

100
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,890

<3-2,Cuddy>对，那些许可证批准人员喜欢化装 舞会和假装的玩意
<3-2,Cuddy>Right,those licensing board folk love to play dress-up and pretend.

<3-6,House>Chase killed that woman. Now foreman's in charge?

<3-7,Cuddy>There's a flow chart in the lobby.

<3-7,Cuddy>For the next three weeks,you answer directly to dr. Foreman.

115
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,570
<3-8,Foreman>而我希望你能9点来参加查房
<3-8,Foreman>And I expect you here for grand rounds at 9:00.

116
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:22,720
<3-8,Foreman>顺便提...
<3-8,Foreman>By the way...

117
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:25,240
<3-8,Foreman>我的咖啡里喜欢加糖
<3-8,Foreman>I like sugar in my coffee.

118
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:29,260
<3-9,Cuddy>如果不灵光，那是你的不灵光
<3-9,Cuddy>If there's a screw-up,it's your screw-up.

119
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:32,500
<3-9,Cuddy>你别指望豪斯医生给你兜底
<3-9,Cuddy>You won't have dr. House to fall back on.

120
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,890
<4-1,Anica>"你系安全带了么?"
<4-1,Anica>"Do you wear a seat belt?"

122
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:44,340
<4-3,Anica>“你接种过牛痘么？”这问题怎么样？
<4-3,Anica>How about,"were you vaccinated for polio?"

123
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,040
<4-3,Anica>我觉得你是为了得到fdr才给我表格的
<4-3,Anica>I think you gave me the form intended for fdr.

124
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,070
<4-4,House>你真喜欢第5名的那个小莫么?
<4-4,House>You really like teeny tiny mo in the fifth?

125
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:51,580
<4-5,Anica>我昨天赌中了6局中的4
<4-5,Anica>I went four for six yesterday.

126
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:54,460
<4-5,Anica>你想赢，先把我治好
<4-5,Anica>You want winners,cure me first.

127
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,990
<4-5,Anica>"你对你的人生大体上还满意么?"
<4-5,Anica>"Are you generally satisfied with your life?"

128
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:00,020
<4-6,House>才没问那样的问题呢
<4-6,House>It does not ask that.

129
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:09,920
<4-7,Anica>你知道，我其实正打算问一位有名望的 医生在场外赌马大厅干嘛？
<4-7,Anica>You know,I was going to ask what a respectable doctor was doing in an OTB parlor.

130
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,860
<4-7,Anica>可不知怎么，那个问题不重要了
<4-7,Anica>Somehow that question doesn't seem relevant anymore.

131
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:14,000
<4-8,House>你的借口呢?
<4-8,House>What's your excuse?

132
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,350
<4-9,Anica>让我兴奋莫名
<4-9,Anica>Turns me on.

133
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:17,250
<4-10,House>是么？还有什么让你兴奋莫名的？
<4-10,House>Yeah? What else turns you on?

134
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:18,580
<4-10,House>药品?
<4-10,House>Drugs?

135
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:19,880
<4-10,House>不经意的性生活?
<4-10,House>Casual sex?

136
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,710
<4-10,House>粗野的性生活?
<4-10,House>Rough sex?

137
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,280
<4-10,House>不经意的粗野的性生活?
<4-10,House>Casual rough sex?

138
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:25,720
<4-10,House>我是医生，我需要知道
<4-10,House>I'm a doctor. I need to know.

139
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,590
<4-11,Anica>没性生活，刚搬来的
<4-11,Anica>No sex. Just moved here.

140
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:31,120
<4-11,Anica>甚至都还没找到工作呢 谁都不认识
<4-11,Anica>Haven't even found a job yet. Don't know anybody.

141
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,250
<4-12,House>没工作就跑这来？
<4-12,House>Came here without a job.

142
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:35,550
<4-12,House>那意思是你并不是搬到这来
<4-12,House>That means you didn't move here.

143
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:38,110
<4-12,House>你是从什么地方逃走到这的
<4-12,House>You moved away from somewhere else.

145
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:45,960
<4-14,House>在吃出处方药么？ 荷尔蒙？强的松？
<4-14,House>You on prescription meds? Hormones? Prednisone?

146
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,350
<4-15,Anica>我已经回答过那个问题了
<4-15,Anica>I already answered that one.

147
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,310
<4-15,Anica>我想是第20号问题什么的
<4-15,Anica>I think it was question number 20-something.

148
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:51,130
<4-16,House>对，我可以一伸手就拿到
<4-16,House>Yeah,and I could reach down and get it,

149
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:53,320
<4-16,House>可那不就破坏我的整体酷形象了么？
<4-16,House>but that would kind of spoil the whole cool move.

150
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:55,100
<4-17,Anica>我没吃什么药
<4-17,Anica>I'm not on any medications.

151
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,180
<4-18,House>你吃素么?
<4-18,House>You vegetarian?

152
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,280
<4-19,Anica>不是，为什么问？
<4-19,Anica>No. Why?

153
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:00,810
<4-20,House>因为你可能得了所谓库辛综合症
<4-20,House>Because you might have something called cushing's syndrome.

154
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:01,730
<4-20,House>那意思是……
<4-20,House>Which basically means--

155
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,560
<4-21,Anica>我的垂体分泌过量促肾上腺皮质激素
<4-21,Anica>my pituitary is overproducing acth,

156
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:07,520
<4-21,Anica>导致我的肾上腺
<4-21,Anica>which is causing my adrenal glands

157
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:10,440
<4-21,Anica>向我的血流中推进过多皮质醇
<4-21,Anica>to push too much cortisol into my bloodstream.

158
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:13,010
<4-22,House>很巧合，我也是个医生
<4-22,House>By coincidence,I'm a doctor too.

159
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:14,820
<4-23,Anica>我从去年患上的
<4-23,Anica>Yeah,I had it last year.

160
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:16,410
<4-23,Anica>他们动了脑科手术
<4-23,Anica>They did brain surgery.

161
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:19,670
<4-23,Anica>从我的垂体里移除了一个腺瘤
<4-23,Anica>Removed an adenoma from my pituitary.

162
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:31,030
<4-23,Anica>嗯?
<4-23,Anica>Huh?

163
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,750
<5-1,House>你刚才说什么?
<5-1,House>What did you just say?

164
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:35,660
<5-1,House>"你是对的，豪斯，她的腺体瘤又长了
<5-1,House>"You were right,house,her pituitary tumor regrew.

165
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,220
<5-1,House>是库辛症，你真神了"
<5-1,House>It is cushing'S.Uncanny how you do that."

166
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:40,190
<5-2,Foreman>其实，那是卡麦伦的主意
<5-2,Foreman>Actually,it was cameron's idea.

167
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,990
<5-3,House>不，卡麦伦有过3个主意
<5-3,House>No,cameronhad three ideas.

168
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:44,820
<5-3,House>我选了其一进行鼓励和培养
<5-3,House>I chose one to encourage,to nurture.

169
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:46,630
<5-4,Foreman>没错，你就是养分
<5-4,Foreman>Yeah,you're all aboutthe nurturing.

170
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,370
<5-5,House>你需要拥抱么?
<5-5,House>Do you need a hug?

171
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,760
<5-6,Foreman>我没看到又长的痕迹
<5-6,Foreman>I don't see any regrowth.

172
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:54,880
<5-6,Foreman>你拿到她医疗记录的传真了么?
<5-6,Foreman>You get a medical recordsfax over?

173
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,880
<5-7,House>聪明的工作，不是勤奋的工作 那是我的哲学，老板
<5-7,House>Work smart,not hard.That's my philosophy,boss.

174
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,020
<5-8,Foreman>我当你说没拿
<5-8,Foreman>I'll take that as a no.

175
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:04,120
<5-8,Foreman>安尼卡，我需要你纹丝不动
<5-8,Foreman>anica,I need you to stay completely still.

176
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,050
<5-9,Anica>对不起
<5-9,Anica>Sorry.

177
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,420
<5-10,Foreman>还是什么都没看到
<5-10,Foreman>Still don't see anything.

178
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,430
<5-11,House>好，那就是微型瘤，肉眼看不到
<5-11,House>Okay,so it's a micro adenoma,too small to see.

179
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,020
<5-12,Foreman>微型到根本不在那的程度
<5-12,Foreman>It's so small,it's not even there.

180
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:17,930
<5-13,House>对，我能预言她在一年前
<5-13,House>Right,it's just a coincidence that I predicted a rare condition

181
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,490
<5-13,House>发生稀有症状完全是出于偶然
<5-13,House>that shehappened to have a year ago.

182
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:20,870
<5-14,Foreman>她的LP检查结果出来了么?
<5-14,Foreman>Results from her lp back yet?

183
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,770
<5-15,House>没做LP，我知道她怎么回事
<5-15,House>Didn't do an lp.I knew what she had.

184
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,740
<5-16,Foreman>去做LP
<5-16,Foreman>Go do the lp.

185
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:36,370
<6-1,House>好，我需要你向一侧翻身
<6-1,House>Okay,I need you to roll overon your side,

186
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:38,230
<6-1,House>吻你的膝盖
<6-1,House>kiss your kneecaps.

187
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,130
<6-2,Anica>舞会时间到
<6-2,Anica>Party time.

188
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:43,450
<6-2,Anica>－我以为只需要一位医生做这个 －我来观察
<6-2,Anica>I thought it only tookone doctor to do this. I'm observing.

189
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,560
<6-4,House>她到这来是要保证我不把你搞瘫痪
<6-4,House>She's here to make sure I don't paralyze you.

190
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,370
<6-5,Anica>以前你做过这个，对吧?
<6-5,Anica>You've done this before,right?

191
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,430
<6-6,House>成功的么?
<6-6,House>Successfully?

192
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:51,350
<6-7,Cameron>他在开玩笑，他是个超凡的医生
<6-7,Cameron>He's kidding. He's an excellent doctor.

193
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,170
<6-8,House>我要用利多卡因使你局部麻醉
<6-8,House>I'm gonna numb the area with some lidocaine.

194
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:55,790
<6-8,House>然后我们就结束比赛了
<6-8,House>And then we're off to the races.

195
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,070
<6-8,House>看我在那是怎么干的了么?
<6-8,House>See what I did there?

196
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:01,090
<6-8,House>我用赌马的行话使病人感觉更舒适
<6-8,House>I used horse racing jargon to make the patient feel more comfortable.

197
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:04,730
<6-8,House>好，来吧
<6-8,House>Okay,here we go.

198
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,250
<6-10,House>感觉上是骨头，那样疼么?
<6-10,House>Felt like bone.Does that hurt?

199
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,750
<6-11,Anica>一点点，你干嘛呢？ 嗷！
<6-11,Anica>A little bit. What are you doing?Oww!

200
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,490
<6-12,Cameron>试试把背往后一点
<6-12,Cameron>Try running your backa bit more.

201
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,360
<6-13,House>现在这样就挺好
<6-13,House>Perfect is the way you are.

202
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,190
<6-13,House>哦，都赖我
<6-13,House>Oops.That was all me.

00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:19,080
<6-15,Cameron>该向下挪一节椎骨
<6-15,Cameron>Might wanna move downone vertebrae.

204
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:21,370
<6-16,House>这比我记忆中难多了
<6-16,House>This is actually much harderthan I remember.

205
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:23,320
<6-16,House>哦!
<6-16,House>Ohh!

206

208
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:28,350
<6-18,Cameron>豪斯医生，还是由我来接手吧
<6-18,Cameron>Dr. House,maybeI should take it from here.

209
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,710
<6-19,House>第8次是魔法次数
<6-19,House>Eighth time's the charm.

210
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,040
<6-19,House>啊!
<6-19,House>Aah!

211
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,880
<6-20,Cameron>你想惹福满生气么?
<6-20,Cameron>You tryingto piss off foreman?

<6-22,Cameron>血压是240比140
<6-22,Cameron>ep's 240 over 140.

214

<6-23,House>把那个东西关了，好么?
<6-23,House>Turn that thing off,will you?

215
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:39,070
<6-24,Cameron>把针拔出来
<6-24,Cameron>Take the needle out.

217
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:44,930
<6-25,House>是高血压临界点
<6-25,House>It's a hypertensive crisis.

218
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:47,130
<6-25,House>给她挂水
<6-25,House>Start her onan iv lopressor drip.

219
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:50,510
<6-25,House>滴速不高于140，她会没事的
<6-25,House>Titrate to systolicless than 140. She'll be fine.

220
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,710
<6-25,House>卡麦伦，到我办公室来
<6-25,House>Cameron,meet me in my office.

221
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:55,470
<6-26,House>探通术既冒险又多余...
<6-26,House>at the risk of sounding redundant...

222
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,600
<6-26,House>而且，没错...
<6-26,House>and right...again...

223
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,520
<6-26,House>她有库欣症
<6-26,House>she has cushing'S.

224
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,780
<6-27,Foreman>库欣症
<6-27,Foreman>Cushing'S.

225
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:03,260
<6-27,Foreman>对，也就是说 你扰乱了她的lp
<6-27,Foreman>Right...the fact that youmangled her lp

226
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,360
<6-27,Foreman>是没有关联的?
<6-27,Foreman>has nothing to do with it?

227
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:06,360
<6-28,House>实际上是完全有关联的
<6-28,House>Actually,it haseverything to do with it.

228
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:10,970
<6-28,House>库欣症加上压力等于高血压临界点
<6-28,House>Cushing's plus stress equals hypertensive crisis.

229
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,520
<6-28,House>干的不错，送了个新手来
<6-28,House>Smart move,sending the rookie.

230
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:16,060
<6-29,Foreman>她最初的症状可能由酗酒导致
<6-29,Foreman>Her initial symptoms could have been caused by alcohol-induced dic.

231
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:17,610
<6-29,Foreman>她到达高血压临界点
<6-29,Foreman>She hada hypertensive crisis because

232
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:19,910
<6-29,Foreman>是因为她已经6个小时没喝酒了
<6-29,Foreman>it's been at least six hours since she hadher last drink.

233
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:20,840
<6-29,Foreman>她在戒酒
<6-29,Foreman>She's detoxing.

234
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,980
<6-30,House>就在我要给她做LP检查的时候么?
<6-30,House>The exact same momentthat I'm futilely trying to give her an lp?

235
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:28,090
<6-31,Foreman>没错，一个在垂体上肉眼 看不到的瘤倒更象真的
<6-31,Foreman>Right,an invisible tumoron her pituitary is much more likely.

236
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,820
<6-32,Chase>如果瘤确实存在其他地方呢?
<6-32,Chase>what if the tumor is somewhere else?

238
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,240
<6-33,Cameron>太罕见了
<6-33,Cameron>It's awfully rare.

239
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,110
<6-34,Chase>那也比肉眼看不见多见
<6-34,Chase>Not as rare asan invisible tumor.

240
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:38,610
<6-35,House>他们干嘛不让你代替福满来负责呢?
<6-35,House>Why didn't theyput you in charge instead of foreman?

241
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:41,490
<6-35,House>哦，对，你是杀了那个女人的人
<6-35,House>Oh,yeah,you're the guythat killed that woman.

242
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:45,780
<6-35,House>在她死于皮质醇前做个平铺扫描吧
<6-35,House>Get a pan-man scan beforeshe dies of cortisol od.

<6-35,House>拜托?
<6-35,House>Please?

244
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,850
<6-36,Foreman>好，做吧
<6-36,Foreman>Fine,do it.

245
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,410
<6-36,Foreman>但如果找不到东西
<6-36,Foreman>But when youdon't find anything,

246
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,980
<6-36,Foreman>就给她吃利眠宁
<6-36,Foreman>put her on a librium taperfor the withdrawal

247

<6-36,Foreman>再找个诊所给她做康复好了
<6-36,Foreman>and get her a bedin a rehab clinic.

248
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,010
<7-1,Chase>肺部正常
<7-1,Chase>lungs look clean.

249
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:13,900
<7-1,Chase>她的淋巴结没有肿大
<7-1,Chase>Her lymph node'snot enlarged.

250
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,820
<7-2,Cameron>卡迪让福满负责这个部门
<7-2,Cameron>Cuddy tapped foreman to run the department.

251
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,550
<7-2,Cameron>都没人问我
<7-2,Cameron>I didn't even get asked.

253
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:22,810
<7-5,Chase>我开玩笑呢
<7-5,Chase>I was kidding.

254
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,550
<7-6,Cameron>是对女人当权的讥讽
<7-6,Cameron>It's the ironyof women in charge.

255
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,950
<7-6,Cameron>他们就是不喜欢其他女人管事
<7-6,Cameron>They don't likeother women in charge.

256
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:29,850
<7-6,Cameron>怎么？你觉得是其他原因么？
<7-6,Cameron>What? You thinkit's something else?

257
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,060
<7-7,Chase>是你自己搞砸了
<7-7,Chase>You sabotaged yourself.

258
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:35,580
<7-7,Chase>你跟豪斯约会，又跟我睡觉
<7-7,Chase>You went on a date with house.You slept with me.

259
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:37,860
<7-7,Chase>让你负责这个部门
<7-7,Chase>Putting you in chargeof this department is like

260
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:40,090
<7-7,Chase>就象是等待性骚扰案件发生一样
<7-7,Chase>a sexual harassmentsuit waiting to happen.

261
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,120
<7-8,Cameron>是啊，就象我真能 创造个敌对环境似的
<7-8,Cameron>Yeah.They're really worried that I'm gonna create a hostile work environment.

262
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:46,620
<7-9,Chase>没准就是这个问题
<7-9,Chase>Maybe that's the problem.

263
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:50,000
<7-9,Chase>做主管就象对豪斯说不一样
<7-9,Chase>Being in charge meanshaving to say "no" to house.

264
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,050
<7-9,Chase>你会那样做么?
<7-9,Chase>Would you hire you for that?

265
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:57,920
<7-9,Chase>安德森强势出场
<7-9,Chase>anderson coming out strong.

266
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:59,000
<7-9,Chase>他在想什么?
<7-9,Chase>What is he thinking?

267
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:01,830
<7-9,Chase>他看到了汤母的作为
<7-9,Chase>He watched what tom meents just did.

268

<8-1,Foreman>你让做的妇科整体核磁共振检查么?
<8-1,Foreman>You ordered mris forthe entire maternity ward?

269
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:07,800
<8-2,House>我当时状态癫狂
<8-2,House>I was in a crazy mood.

270
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:09,890
<8-2,House>还好我有个新老板来收拾烂摊子
<8-2,House>Good thing I gota new boss to back me up.

271
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:12,070
<8-2,House>尽管我觉得这中间有有用的东西
<8-2,House>Although I think one of thoseis actually necessary.

272
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,580
<8-2,House>在你都取消前还是梳理一下吧
<8-2,House>Better comb through beforeyou cancel them all.

273
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:19,470
<8-3,Foreman>豪斯，你到底想让我怎样?
<8-3,Foreman>What do you expect meto do,house?

274
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,520
<8-3,Foreman>放弃？哭？
<8-3,Foreman>Quit? Cry?

275
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:24,440
<8-4,House>其实，我希望你能名副其职
<8-4,House>Actually,I expect you toact like what you are.

276
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:27,800
<8-4,House>我的雇员、我的属下
<8-4,House>My employee.My subordinate.

277

<8-4,House>我的婊子
<8-4,House>My bitch.

278
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,680
<8-5,Foreman>对啊，既然你好意询问……
<8-5,Foreman>Yeah. Well,sinceyou asked nicely--

<8-6,House>上帝，我不能相信 我拉下了整年的离职摘要
<8-6,House>god. I can't believe I gotmore than a year behind on my discharge summaries.

280
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:38,640
<8-6,House>得赶紧赶上来
<8-6,House>Gotta get caught up.

281
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:39,660
<8-6,House>哦，不，等等
<8-6,House>Oh,no. Wait.

282
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,630
<8-6,House>我已经没有授权签这些东西了
<8-6,House>I'm not authorizedto sign these anymore.

283
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:43,010
<8-6,House>但你能
<8-6,House>Only you are.

284
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:46,190
<8-7,Foreman>放马过来吧，我不会崩溃的
<8-7,Foreman>Keep it coming.I'm not gonna break.

285
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,340
<8-8,Cameron>扫描显示她的胰脏有问题
<8-8,Cameron>Scan showed a masson her pancreas.

286
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:53,730
<8-9,Chase>看上去是恶性的，可能不宜动手术
<8-9,Chase>It looks malignant.Probably inoperable.

287
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:57,570
<8-9,Chase>我看至多挺两个月
<8-9,Chase>I'd give her two months.

288
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:04,690
<8-10,House>从好的方面看，我是对的
<8-10,House>On the bright side,it still means I was right.

289
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:13,420
<9-1,Anica>豪斯医生在哪?
<9-1,Anica>Where's Dr. House?

290

<9-1,Anica>Dr. Foreman'soverseeing your case.

291
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:18,340
<9-2,Cameron>他认为我跟你说比较恰当
<9-2,Cameron>He thought it'd be best if I spoke with you.

292
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:21,080
<9-2,Cameron>我们在你的胰脏发现了一个肿块
<9-2,Cameron>We found a massin your pancreas.

293
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,420
<9-2,Cameron>象癌症
<9-2,Cameron>It looks like cancer.

294
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:28,030
<9-3,Anica>也就是说胰脏的东西导致我抽搐?
<9-3,Anica>So something in my pancreas caused me to have a seizure?

295
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,680
<9-3,Anica>或许
<9-3,Anica>Probably.

296
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:33,010
<9-4,Cameron>但更重要的问题是...
<9-4,Cameron>But the bigger point is...

297
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:38,510
<9-4,Cameron>胰脏癌症成活超过 一年的病例不足两成
<9-4,Cameron>a one year survival ratefor pancreatic cancer is less than 20%.

298
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,550
<9-5,Anica>那治疗方案呢?
<9-5,Anica>So what's the treatment?

299
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:46,260
<9-6,Cameron>我们要对肿块进行活检以验明正身
<9-6,Cameron>We need to biopsy the mass to see whatwe're dealing with.

300
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:48,230
<9-6,Cameron>然后...
<9-6,Cameron>And...

301
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:52,540
<9-6,Cameron>我们会提供选择
<9-6,Cameron>then we can recommendoptions from there.

302
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:54,620
<9-7,Anica>听起来不错
<9-7,Anica>Sounds good.

303
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,080
<9-8,Cameron>活检需要得到你的同意
<9-8,Cameron>I need your consent to do the biopsy.

00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,900
<12-5,Foreman>小蔡，等等
<12-5,Foreman>Chase,hold on.

353
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:42,770
<12-6,House>你怎么能把他训练的这么快的?
<12-6,House>How'd you get him trained so fast?

354
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:45,160
<12-6,House>电领子？口袋里有零食么？
<12-6,House>Electronic collar? Got treats in your pocket?

355
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:48,230
<12-7,Cameron>胰脏活检的报告她都没读
<12-7,Cameron>She didn't even read the consent form for the pancreatic biopsy.

356
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,240
<12-8,Chase>谁读啊?
<12-8,Chase>Who reads those things?

357
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:51,230
<12-9,Cameron>她不读，也许是因为她知道
<12-9,Cameron>Maybe she didn't read itbecause she knew

358
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:52,620
<12-9,Cameron>自己根本就没病
<12-9,Cameron>that there was nothingwrong with her.

359
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,510
<12-9,Cameron>库欣症还有其他解释
<12-9,Cameron>There is another explanationfor the cushing'S.

360
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:56,840
<12-9,Cameron>或许是她自己注射的激素
<12-9,Cameron>Maybe she injected herselfwith the acth.

361
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,770
<12-9,Cameron>她的举止很象妄想症
<12-9,Cameron>Her behavior suggests munchausen'S.

362
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:01,460
<12-9,Cameron>过去的4个月里她有4次入院记录
<12-9,Cameron>She's had four hospitalizations in the last four months.

363
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:06,060
<12-10,House>哦，很多入院治疗的记录对你来说就是没事找事
<12-10,House>Well,being hospitalized a lot certainly points to nothing being wrong with you.

364
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,730
<12-11,Cameron>她自打入院后就没有任何症状
<12-11,Cameron>She's had zero symptomssince she got here.

365
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,470
<12-11,Cameron>她的胰脏伤痕累累
<12-11,Cameron>The scarring on her pancreas could be be caused from

366
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:13,290
<12-11,Cameron>说明她注射苯而导致抽搐
<12-11,Cameron>injecting herself with the benzene and setting offthe seizures.

367
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,200
<12-12,House>她做过脑外科手术
<12-12,House>she's had brain surgery.

368
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:17,630
<12-12,House>你可以装胃疼 但无法装出脑部肿瘤
<12-12,House>You can fake a stomach ache.You can't fake a brain tumor.

369
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,990
<12-13,Cameron>但可以装出个肉眼看不见的来
<12-13,Cameron>You can fake an invisible one.

370
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,730
<12-13,Cameron>我们该查她的住所找药品和耳咽管
<12-13,Cameron>We should check her apartment. Look for medications,syringes.

372
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:28,360
<12-16,House>比非法闯入好点吧
<12-16,House>Not if you get caught breaking in.

373
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:32,020
<12-17,Foreman>那就别被抓，豪斯
<12-17,Foreman>So don't get caught,house.

374
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:35,220
<13-1,Cameron>你觉得卡迪为什么挑福满不挑我?
<13-1,Cameron>why do you think cuddy picked foreman over me?

375
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,030
<13-1,Cameron>是不是我做错了什么 或需要改进什么
<13-1,Cameron>If I done something wrong or if there's somethingI needed to improve on--

376
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:38,000
<13-2,House>如果我告诉你她想要黑人
<13-2,House>would it make you shut up

377
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:39,460
<13-2,House>是不是可以让你住嘴?
<13-2,House>if I told you she wantedsomeone black?

378
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:42,050
<13-3,Cameron>你怎么评价我的领导才能?
<13-3,Cameron>How would you describemy leadership skills?

379
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:44,380
<13-4,House>不存在，或很好
<13-4,House>Nonexistent. Otherwise excellent.

380
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:47,240
<13-5,Cameron>当领导总比当傻子强吧
<13-5,Cameron>There's more to beinga leader than being a jerk.

381
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:49,610
<13-6,House>无人知晓
<13-6,House>The world will never know.

382
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:56,360
<13-7,Cameron>不，没门，刚下完雪
<13-7,Cameron>No. No way.It just snowed.

383
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,590
<13-8,House>昨天，路挺好
<13-8,House>Yesterday.The streets are clear.

384
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,850
<13-9,Cameron>我的车在那
<13-9,Cameron>My car is right there.

385
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:03,440
<13-10,House>榆树街有路障
<13-10,House>There's construction on elm.

386
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:05,330
<13-10,House>摩托车快些
<13-10,House>Bike'll be faster.

387
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:28,500
<14-1,Cameron>浴室里都有书
<14-1,Cameron>there's even books in the bathroom.

388
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:30,950
<14-2,House>要么她就很聪明
<14-2,House>Well,either she'svery smart

389
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:34,350
<14-2,House>要么就是纤维缺乏
<14-2,House>or she has a severefiber deficiency.

390
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:41,900
<14-3,Cameron>她跟她的眼科医生在周二有约
<14-3,Cameron>She's got an appointment with her ophthalmologiston tuesday

391
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:44,670
<14-3,Cameron>周4和妇科医生有约
<14-3,Cameron>and an appointment withher gynecologist on thursday.

392
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,690
<14-3,Cameron>同时跟多个医生有约
<14-3,Cameron>Multiple appointmentswith multiple doctors.

393
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:49,600
<14-3,Cameron>妄想症症状
<14-3,Cameron>Symptom of munchausen'S.

394
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:53,170
<14-4,House>或者跳出束缚思考
<14-4,House>Or,just thinking outside the box here,

395
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:56,630
<14-4,House>她有个阴道同时阅读有困难
<14-4,House>she has a vaginaand trouble reading.

396
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:00,280
<14-4,House>这有3副阅读眼睛 是不同配方的
<14-4,House>There's three pairs of reading glasses.  Each with different prescriptions.

397
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:03,070
<14-4,House>正可以解释脑瘤压迫视觉神经
<14-4,House>Which would be explained by a tumor pressingon the optic nerve.

398
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:04,940
<14-5,Cameron>因为你在为她得癌找佐证
<14-5,Cameron>Because you're looking for her to have a tumor.

399
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:07,010
<14-6,House>而你在找...
<14-6,House>And you are looking for...

400
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,210
<14-6,House>妄想症的佐证
<14-6,House>a person with munchausen's syndrome

401
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:13,100
<14-6,House>喝电池酸并不需要 他们去眼科医生那里去扩瞳
<14-6,House>drinks battery acid. They don't go to an ophthalmologist to get their pupils dilated.

402
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,680
<14-7,Cameron>眼科医生也是医生
<14-7,Cameron>An ophthalmologist is a doctor.

403
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,440
<14-7,Cameron>注意力是注意力
<14-7,Cameron>Attention is attention.

404
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,530
<14-8,House>你联系了几家医院?
<14-8,House>How many hospitals have you contacted?

405
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:21,310
<14-8,House>有任何一位医生说她疯了么？ 她不是妄想症
<14-8,House>Has one doctor said she's crazy? It's not munchausen'S.

406
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:23,510
<14-9,Cameron>不是你的期待
<14-9,Cameron>It's not your call.

407
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:27,390
<15-1,House>如果你觉得她有妄想症
<15-1,House>If you think she's got munchausen's,

408
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:29,610
<15-1,House>那你该有明显的事实给他
<15-1,House>then obviously you gotsomething to show the man.

409
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,070
<15-1,House>一个灌洗器，一瓶激素
<15-1,House>A syringe in her apartment.A bottle of acth.

410
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,160
<15-2,Foreman>妄想症的病人很善于隐藏他们的行踪
<15-2,Foreman>Munchausen patients are good at covering their tracks.

411
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:36,020
<15-3,House>哦，对啊，所以我们什么都没找到
<15-3,House>Oh,right. So the fact that we found nothing

412
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:36,880
<15-3,House>倒能证明问题了
<15-3,House>proves there's something.

413
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:39,800
<15-4,Cameron>看看芝加哥她的医生们的报告啊
<15-4,Cameron>Look at the pathology reports from the surgeryshe had in chicago.

414
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,700
<15-4,Cameron>他们切除了她30％的垂体
<15-4,Cameron>They removed 30%of her pituitary.

415
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:42,690
<15-4,Cameron>他们没发现瘤
<15-4,Cameron>They found no tumor.

416
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,460
<15-5,Foreman>可能是医生没找到
<15-5,Foreman>It's possible the surgeons just missed it.

417
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:46,620
<15-5,Foreman>我的意思是那种手术 切开然后希望
<15-5,Foreman>I mean that kind of surgery. You're just cutting and hoping.

418
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,660
<15-5,Foreman>当然，我们都对
<15-5,Foreman>Of course!We're both right.

419
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:51,080
<15-6,House>完美的结论，大家都高兴
<15-6,House>Excellent solution.Everybody's happy.

420
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,070
<15-6,House>拜托，提高点，福满
<15-6,House>Come on. Step up,foreman.

421
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:55,650
<15-6,House>如果你觉得我对 让我往病人脑袋里插针
<15-6,House>If you think I'm right, order me to stick a needlein her brain.

422
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,090
<15-6,House>如果你觉得卡麦伦对 送病人回家
<15-6,House>If you think cameron's right,send the patient home.

423
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:00,370
<15-6,House>她要么死，要么活
<15-6,House>Either she'll be fine,or she'll die.

424
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:04,470
<15-7,Foreman>征求她的意见，做静脉取样
<15-7,Foreman>Do the venous sampling.Get her consent.

425
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:13,510
<15-8,House>干的不错，老板可以保住你的屁股了
<15-8,House>Nice move,boss. Way to cover your ass.

426
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:14,900
<15-9,Foreman>我只是赞同你罢了
<15-9,Foreman>I just agreed with you.

427
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,480
<15-9,Foreman>并不是你觉得我对
<15-9,Foreman>Not becauseyou think I'm right.

428
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:18,450
<15-10,House>你只是选择了安全通道
<15-10,House>You're just taking the safe route.

429
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:20,170
<15-10,House>你是软脚虾
<15-10,House>You're a wuss.

430
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:23,590
<15-10,House>别担心，我会守口如瓶的
<15-10,House>Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me.

431
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:29,750
<15-10,House>嘿，威尔森猜刚才福满干了什么?
<15-10,House>Hey,wilson! Guess what foreman just did?

432
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:37,820
<16-1,Anica>嗨
<16-1,Anica>Hi.

433
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:42,270
<16-2,Cameron>这是往你脑子里放置导管的同意书
<16-2,Cameron>This is a consent formto stick a wire into your brain.

434
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,280
<16-2,Cameron>对医院来说这是很重要的程序
<16-2,Cameron>It's important for hospitalsto get these signed

435
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:46,790
<16-2,Cameron>但其实根本没必要
<16-2,Cameron>for procedures that arecompletely unnecessary.

436
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,740
<16-3,Anica>那你干嘛还做?
<16-3,Anica>Then why are you doing it?

437
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:52,050
<16-3,Anica>因为你精神有问题
<16-3,Anica>Because you're mentally ill.

438
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,690
<16-4,Cameron>你为吸引医生注意给自己
<16-4,Cameron>You injected yourselfwith acth to induce cushing's

439
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:56,690
<16-4,Cameron>注射激素导致抽搐
<16-4,Cameron>to get attentionfrom doctors.

440
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:58,780
<16-4,Cameron>到目前为止有效
<16-4,Cameron>And so far it's worked.

441
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,330
<16-5,Anica>我要见其他医生
<16-5,Anica>I'd like to seeanother doctor.

442
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:02,750
<16-6,Cameron>我没给你要的东西么?
<16-6,Cameron>I'm not giving youwhat you want?

443
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:04,320
<16-7,Anica>我不要个婊子
<16-7,Anica>I don't want a bitch.

444
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,230
<16-8,Cameron>签了这个表格，我就走
<16-8,Cameron>Just sign the forms,okay,and I'll get out of here.

445
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:09,470
<16-8,Cameron>希望无论你给自己注射什么
<16-8,Cameron>Hopefully for you,whateveryou injected yourself with

446
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:11,150
<16-8,Cameron>在一个真正关心你的医生
<16-8,Cameron>won't wear offbefore you get fun of a caring and

447
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:14,400
<16-8,Cameron>打开你的脑袋前别用光了
<16-8,Cameron>concerned doctor cutting into your head.

448
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:31,920
<17-1,Foreman>你选我让豪斯感觉悲惨是吧？
<17-1,Foreman>You chose me to makehouse miserable,didn't you?

449
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,360
<17-2,Cuddy>很明显他让你觉得很悲惨
<17-2,Cuddy>Apparently he's makingyou miserable.

450
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:35,960
<17-2,Cuddy>真感人
<17-2,Cuddy>That's impressive.

451
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:37,300
<17-3,Foreman>另请高明吧
<17-3,Foreman>Find someone else.

452
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:40,400
<17-4,Cuddy>不，6年了，我头一次可以拿到
<17-4,Cuddy>No. For the first timein six years

453
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:43,560
<17-4,Cuddy>试验单副本和所有程序副本
<17-4,Cuddy>I'm getting copied on all experimentaltests and procedures.

454
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,660
<17-4,Cuddy>问诊时间充足
<17-4,Cuddy>Clinic hours have beenlogged and completed.

455
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,900
<17-4,Cuddy>在豪斯听政前你给了我4个月
<17-4,Cuddy>You've given me four monthsof house's dictations

456
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,250
<17-4,Cuddy>使我可以找保险公司算账
<17-4,Cuddy>so I can finally billinsurance companies.

457
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,580
<17-5,Foreman>而我只证明了豪斯可以让我很悲惨
<17-5,Foreman>I only did that stuff to prove he couldn'tmake me miserable.

458
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,230
<17-6,Cuddy>干的不错
<17-6,Cuddy>Well,way to go.

459
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:58,880
<17-6,Cuddy>现在所有人都得其所哉了 连豪斯也是
<17-6,Cuddy>Now everybody'sgetting what they need. Even house.

460
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:03,420
<17-6,Cuddy>他可以扮演科学狂人 这个部门运转顺畅
<17-6,Cuddy>He gets to play mad scientist, and this departmentruns smoothly.

461
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:06,390
<17-7,Foreman>而我在接下来的3个星期 还得继续卡在那么
<17-7,Foreman>So I'm stuck with thisfor the next three weeks.

462
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,590
<17-8,Cuddy>没准更长呢
<17-8,Cuddy>Maybe longer.

463
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:13,000
<17-8,Cuddy>如果这一切不是假装你会有兴趣么?
<17-8,Cuddy>Would you be interestedif this wasn't just pretend?

464
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,800
<18-1,House>妈妈怎么说?
<18-1,House>What did mommy say?

465
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:17,360
<18-1,House>我袜子里没有糖果
<18-1,House>I don't get any candyin my stocking.

466
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:19,210
<18-2,Foreman>病人准备做静脉取样么?
<18-2,Foreman>Patient being preppedfor the venous sampling?

467
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:20,060
<18-2,Foreman>对
<18-2,Foreman>Yeah.

468
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,690
<18-3,Cameron>精神有问题的病人正准备 进行一个无意义的程序
<18-3,Cameron>Mentally ill patientis right on track for a pointless procedure.

469
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:24,880
<18-4,Foreman>好，我们知道你的异议了
<18-4,Foreman>Yeah,we get your objection.

470
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:32,600
<18-4,Foreman>福满
<18-4,Foreman>Foreman.

471
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:35,210
<18-4,Foreman>你肯定吗?
<18-4,Foreman>Are you sure?

472
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,090
<18-4,Foreman>那没理由，再查一下
<18-4,Foreman>That doesn't make any sense. Check it again.

473
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:40,570
<18-4,Foreman>我们得暂停取样检查了
<18-4,Foreman>We gotta delaythe venous sampling.

474
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:44,330
<18-5,Cameron>为什么？她的尿变橙色了么？
<18-5,Cameron>Why? Her urine turning orange?

475
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,090
<18-6,Foreman>你怎会知道?
<18-6,Foreman>How would you know that?

476
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,880
<18-7,Cameron>因为那是利福平的功效
<18-7,Cameron>Because that's whatrifampin does.

477
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:50,540
<18-8,Chase>她并没用抗生素?
<18-8,Chase>She's not on antibiotics?

478
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:54,430
<18-9,Cameron>但如果一个妄想症病人 发觉她的把戏要被揭穿了
<18-9,Cameron>But if a munchausen's patient thinks she's aboutto get busted,

479
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:58,580
<18-9,Cameron>她看到一个标着“危险”字样 的药瓶就会拿几片
<18-9,Cameron>she sees pills labeled "dangerous: Might cause seizures," she might grab a couple.

480
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:01,970
<18-9,Cameron>而如果那个贴标签的瓶子碰巧是抗生素
<18-9,Cameron>And if that label were accidentally on a bottle of antibiotics

481
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:04,370
<18-9,Cameron>而那个瓶子又碰巧是放在了她屋里...
<18-9,Cameron>and if that bottle were accidentally left in her room...

482
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:06,520
<18-10,Foreman>- 你陷害她?- 没准
<18-10,Foreman>- you set her up? - Might have.

483
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,190
<18-10,Foreman>是妄想症
<18-10,Foreman>It's munchausen'S.

484
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,690
<18-11,Cameron>这些都是她自找
<18-11,Cameron>All this she did to herself.

485
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,630
<19-1,Anica>我不知道你到底说什么
<19-1,Anica>I don't know what the hellyou're talking about.

486
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,320
<19-1,Anica>我抽筋了
<19-1,Anica>I had a seizure.

487
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,230
<19-1,Anica>我病了，我需要你的帮助
<19-1,Anica>I'm sick.I need your help.

488
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:37,980
<19-2,Cameron>不是这个科
<19-2,Cameron>Not from this department.

489
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,770
<19-2,Cameron>利福平半衰期3个小时
<19-2,Cameron>The half-life of rifampinis three hours.

490
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,740
<19-2,Cameron>然后会推荐你精神科医生
<19-2,Cameron>After that,you'll getyour psych referral

491
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,060
<19-2,Cameron>和你的账单
<19-2,Cameron>and your discharge papers.

492
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:45,190
<19-3,Anica>你知道，不因为你把手指插到喉咙里
<19-3,Anica>You know,just because you stick your fingers

493
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:47,560
<19-3,Anica>我们大家都被你搞了
<19-3,Anica>down your throatdoesn't mean the rest of usare screwed up.

494
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:51,720
<19-4,Cameron>我看当合作失败后 你就会变得敌意了
<19-4,Cameron>I guess when cooperation fails,you move onto hostility.

495
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,250
<19-5,Anica>我不是蓄意这样做的
<19-5,Anica>I didn't do this to myself.

496
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:08,070
<19-6,Chase>100% 承诺
<19-6,Chase>100% commitment.

497
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,480
<19-6,Chase>由说谎的人签署
<19-6,Chase>Sign of a good liar.

498
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,410
<19-7,Foreman>也是反社会的人签署的
<19-7,Foreman>Also the sign of a sociopath.

499
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,670
<19-7,Foreman>你在干嘛?
<19-7,Foreman>What are you doing?

500
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:15,820
<19-8,House>改正你最后一个笔记
<19-8,House>Correcting your last note.

501
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:18,390
<19-8,House>我们不能放走她，她有病
<19-8,House>We can't discharge her,she's sick.

502
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:20,840
<19-8,House>有人告诉你你笔迹象姑娘么？
<19-8,House>Anybody ever tell you you write like a girl?

503
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:21,830
<19-8,House>什么?
<19-8,House>What?

504
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:24,120
<19-9,Foreman>你对橙色尿液有其他解释么?
<19-9,Foreman>You got some other explanation for orange urine?

506
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,810
<19-11,Foreman>你就是无法承认她使你惨败的事实
<19-11,Foreman>You just don't wanna admitthat she skunked you.

507
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:31,270
<19-12,House>叫“狼来了”的孩子
<19-12,House>At the end of "the boy who cried wolf"

508
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,430
<19-12,House>结果是狼真的来了
<19-12,House>the wolf really does come.

509
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:36,090
<19-12,House>他吃了孩子、羊还有孩子的父母
<19-12,House>And he eats the sheepand the boy and his parents.

510
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:37,320
<19-13,Chase>羊没吃父母
<19-13,Chase>The wolf doesn't eat the parents.

511
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,830
<19-15,Foreman>- 我讲的时候就吃了- 现在不由你讲故事，我在讲
<19-15,Foreman>- It does when I tell it. - You're not telling the story now. I am.

512
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:43,880
<19-16,House>看，我查了她的记录
<19-16,House>Look,I checked her records.

513
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:46,200
<19-16,House>她所有的住院记录所为理由不同
<19-16,House>All her hospitalizations were for different things.

514
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:49,170
<19-16,House>脑瘤、昏厥、皮疹、抽搐
<19-16,House>Brain tumor,fainting spells,skin rashes,seizures.

515
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,010
<19-16,House>她的验血记录到处都是
<19-16,House>She's had every blood test known to man and the resultswere all over the map.

516
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:55,110
<19-16,House>结果只有一个：低ACT
<19-16,House>There's only one constant.Low hct.

517
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,410
<19-16,House>贫血是真的
<19-16,House>The anemia's real.

518
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,660
<19-17,Cameron>能导致那个症状的药品 她能吃到的多了
<19-17,Cameron>There's a million things she could have taken to have done that.

519
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,350
<19-18,House>对，也可能根本就是月经闹的
<19-18,House>True. Could just be her M.O.

520
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:03,600
<19-18,House>她自找了两种病，一种老变 另一种从来不变
<19-18,House>She self-induces two illnesses. One always changes,one never does.

521
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:07,110
<19-18,House>又或许她得了妄想症和再生障碍型贫血
<19-18,House>Or maybe,she has munchausen'sand aplastic anemia.

522
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:09,260
<19-18,House>也就是说，没有适当的治疗
<19-18,House>Which would mean withoutthe proper treatment, she'll continue to get

523
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:13,060
<19-18,House>她会变得越来越虚弱、严重之至内出血而死
<19-18,House>sicker,weaker,eventually she'll startbleeding internally and die.

524
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:15,210
<19-19,Foreman>- 她不会变得更重- 她会的
<19-19,Foreman>- She's not getting sicker.- She will.

525
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:18,440
<19-21,Chase>如果她的骨髓在衰亡 那整个血液系统都会出问题的
<19-21,Chase>If her bone marrow was dying, the entire blood panelwould be affected.

527
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:21,700
<19-22,House>我们要做骨髓活检
<19-22,House>We need to doa bone marrow biopsy.

528
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:23,480
<19-23,Foreman>- 不，不做检查了- 你看
<19-23,Foreman>- No. No more tests.- Look.

529
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:25,830
<19-24,House>你看，如果你用妄想症把她踢到一边
<19-24,House>You kick her to the curbwith a munchausen's diagnosis,

530
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,470
<19-24,House>今后保证再也没有医生会相信她的话了
<19-24,House>you're guaranteeing that no doctor will ever listento her again.

531
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:31,250
<19-25,Foreman>我们做再多的检查也只是喂养了她的精神而已
<19-25,Foreman>We do more tests,we'll onlybe feeding her psychosis.

532
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:33,980
<19-25,Foreman>我们给予她越多注意，她就越贪婪
<19-25,Foreman>The more attention we give her,the more she'll want.

533
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:37,970
<19-26,House>如果她不知道我们在检查她如何?
<19-26,House>What if she doesn't know we're testing her?

534
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:40,600
<19-27,Foreman>豪斯，你错了 认命吧
<19-27,Foreman>House. You were wrong. Live with it.

535
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,190
<19-28,House>早前的检查还剩下些血液
<19-28,House>There's probably some blood left over from previous tests.

536
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:45,640
<19-29,Cameron>只验血无法证实再生障碍性贫血
<19-29,Cameron>Blood tests alone can't confirm aplastic anemia.

537
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:48,890
<19-30,House>对，我知道，所以才要做骨髓活检
<19-30,House>Yes,I know. That's why I wanna doa bone marrow biopsy.

538
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:52,490
<19-30,House>血液检查可以显示系统疾病或滤过病毒或毒素的成因
<19-30,House>The blood tests could showa systemic disease, or a virus or toxin that could be the cause.

539
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:55,450
<19-31,Foreman>好，你想要多查点血么？把你自己敲晕吧
<19-31,Foreman>Fine. You wanna test the extra blood? Knock yourself out.

540
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,380
<19-31,Foreman>但病人已经超限了
<19-31,Foreman>But the patient is off-limits.

541
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:59,240
<19-32,House>如果结果是阳性的……
<19-32,House>And if the resultsare positive...

542
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:01,490
<19-32,House>我可以活检么?
<19-32,House>I get my biopsy?

543
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:05,830
<19-32,House>是条安全的路
<19-32,House>It's a safe way to go.

544
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:24,500
<20-1,House>我需要做所有检查和PCR
<20-1,House>I need all of these testsand a pcr

545
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:26,630
<20-1,House>只能用这些样品
<20-1,House>done on this sample.

546
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:28,460
<20-2,Lab tech>需要更多血
<20-2,Lab tech>You're gonna need more blood.

547
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,790
<20-3,House>病人没血了
<20-3,House>Patient's empty.

548
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,880
<20-4,Lab tech>那我就不能做
<20-4,Lab tech>Then I can't do it.

549
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:36,320
<20-6,Lab tech>- 你可以试试- 我还想试试做名模呢
<20-6,Lab tech>- You can try. - You can try to look like salma hayek.

550
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,280
<20-6,Lab tech>可那是不会发生的
<20-6,Lab tech>It's not gonna make it happen.

551
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,350
<20-7,House>你或许没有名模的屁股
<20-7,House>You may not have salma's ass,

552
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,100
<20-7,House>可她没有你的眼睛啊
<20-7,House>but she doesn't have your eyes.

553
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:50,150
<20-8,Lab tech>对，是啊
<20-8,Lab tech>Yeah,right.

554
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,200
<20-8,Lab tech>你多久要?
<20-8,Lab tech>How soon do you need it?

555
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:01,190
<21-1,Foreman>韦森大夫，我能私下跟你谈谈么?
<21-1,Foreman>dr. Wilson. Can I talk to you about something in confidence?

556
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,340
<21-2,Wilson>当然
<21-2,Wilson>Of course.

557
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,650
<21-4,Wilson>- 关于豪斯- 哦，那算了
<21-4,Wilson>- It's about house. - Oh. Then no.

558
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,190
<21-4,Wilson>好吧
<21-4,Wilson>Fine.

559
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:08,640
<21-4,Wilson>我什么都不说
<21-4,Wilson>I won't say anything.

560
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,620
<21-5,Foreman>你认为豪斯有可能把我
<21-5,Foreman>Do you think there's any way

561
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,650
<21-5,Foreman>当成他的真老板么?
<21-5,Foreman>house would take meseriously as his boss?

562
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:17,420
<21-6,Wilson>哦，这是从何而来啊?
<21-6,Wilson>Uh...where is this coming from?

563
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,080
<21-6,Wilson>卡迪没说什么么?
<21-6,Wilson>Did cuddy say something?

564
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,520
<21-7,Foreman>我们谈了，她提的
<21-7,Foreman>We talked.She intimated.

565
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,740
<21-8,Wilson>而你征求我的意见去篡他的权?
<21-8,Wilson>And you want my adviceon how to usurp him?

566
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,910
<21-8,Wilson>在远古你需要袍儿、
<21-8,Wilson>It's very ancient rome.He'll need a toga,of course. A...

567
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:30,100
<21-8,Wilson>剑……
<21-8,Wilson>...sword.

568
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:32,910
<21-9,Foreman>不是政变，是找到与他共存的方法
<21-9,Foreman>It's not a coup. I just wanna figure out some way we canwork together.

569
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,790
<21-9,Foreman>我的意思是从管理角度我运作团队
<21-9,Foreman>I mean,I keep the team running from an administrative point of view.

570
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,500
<21-9,Foreman>豪斯无需应付红胶带
<21-9,Foreman>House doesn't have to dealwith the red tape.

571
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:40,320
<21-10,Wilson>- 双赢- 我肯定他也那么看
<21-10,Wilson>- It's a win-win. - I'm sure he'll see it that way.

572
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:43,210
<21-11,Foreman>你对于接近他,
<21-11,Foreman>You have any adviceon how to approach him,

573
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,700
<21-11,Foreman>应付他有任何建议么?
<21-11,Foreman>how to deal with the guy?

574
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:46,090
<21-12,Wilson>没有
<21-12,Wilson>No.

575
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,710
<21-13,Foreman>但你不会告诉他我们谈过是吧?
<21-13,Foreman>But you won't tell himwe talked?

576
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,550
<21-13,Foreman>不会
<21-13,Foreman>No.

<22-5,House>不是所有的镰状细胞病人是黑人
<22-5,House>Not all sickle cell patientsare black.

<22-6,Foreman>她其他的血样并未显示镰状细胞
<22-6,Foreman>None of her other blood panelsshowed any sign of sickle cell.

591
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,760
<22-6,Foreman>也就是说昨天发生了什么突变
<22-6,Foreman>Which means either something's changed drasticallysince yesterday,

592
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:46,170
<22-6,Foreman>或者这不是她的血液
<22-6,Foreman>or this isn't her blood.

<22-7,House>我试了，但血液不够
<22-7,House>I tried,and there wasn't enough blood left over.

597
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,790
<22-7,House>你就让我做活检吧
<22-7,House>You just let medo the biopsy.

<23-2,House>如果不是我，你就被炒了
<23-2,House>And if it wasn't for me,you would have been fired.

600
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:09,300
<23-3,Chase>你干嘛不自己去搞样品?
<23-3,Chase>Why don't you just getthe sample yourself?

601
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,210
<23-3,Chase>从几时起你开始在乎老板说的话了?
<23-3,Chase>Since when have you caredwhat your boss said?

602
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:13,750
<23-4,House>我不在乎他们说什么 我在乎他们做什么
<23-4,House>I don't care what anybody says,I care what they do.

00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,790
<23-4,House>现在，需要黑白分明
<23-4,House>And right now,blackpoleon blackaparte

604

<23-4,House>has got the nurseson red alert. I can't get intothe patient's room.

605
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:21,360
<23-4,House>所以，来吧，我吸引敌人的火力
<23-4,House>So come on,I'll draw the enemy fire,

608
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:28,420
<23-6,House>你更怕谁?
<23-6,House>Who are you more afraid of?

609
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,220
<23-7,Chase>我不怕福满，我跟他意见相同
<23-7,Chase>I'm not afraid of foreman.I agree with him.

610
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:35,600
<23-7,Chase>所有检查都支持他
<23-7,Chase>All the tests back him up.

611
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,910
<23-8,House>并没完成所有检查
<23-8,House>All the tests have not been done.

612
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:42,270
<23-8,House>你该知道那黑家伙的统治是暂时的吧
<23-8,House>You do realizethat blackaparte's reign is only temporary.

613
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:44,260
<23-9,Chase>我也知道无论我怎么做
<23-9,Chase>I also realize thatno matter what I do,

614
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:46,840
<23-9,Chase>你都还是会象对待废物一样的对待我
<23-9,Chase>you're still gonna treat me like crap.

615
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,620
<23-10,House>废物是相对的
<23-10,House>Crap is a relative term.

616
00:29:58,110 --> 00:29:59,650
<24-1,Chase>我甚至没能进她的房间
<24-1,Chase>I never even made itinto the room.

617
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:02,840
<24-2,Foreman>才要了一个套针管护士就叫了主治医
<24-2,Foreman>Nurses called the attending as soon as a trocarwas ordered.

618
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:05,150
<24-3,House>你用了她的真名?
<24-3,House>You used her real name?

619
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,980
<24-4,Cuddy>我刚签了你病人的账单
<24-4,Cuddy>I just processed your patient'sdischarge papers.

620
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:09,980
<24-4,Cuddy>她正要出院
<24-4,Cuddy>She's on her way out right now.

621
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,770
<24-4,Cuddy>哎
<24-4,Cuddy>Whoa! Whoa.

622
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,560
<25-1,House>等等
<25-1,House>wait up.

623
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,570
<25-1,House>没事了，她要留下
<25-1,House>It's all right. She's gonna stay.

625
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:23,760
<25-4,Anica>我 不想再听混话了
<25-4,Anica>I don't need to hear the riot act again.

626
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,890
<25-6,Anica>那再做一个试验呢?
<25-6,Anica>How would you like anothermedical test?

627
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:28,830
<25-7,House>- 什么?- 坐
<25-7,House>- What?- Sit.

628
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:30,620
<25-8,Anica>为什么?
<25-8,Anica>Why?

629
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,810
<25-9,House>那样你晕过去的时候不会磕碎你的头骨
<25-9,House>So you don't crack your skull when you pass out.

630
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:36,250
<25-9,House>你就听话吧
<25-9,House>Just do it.

631
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:40,900
<25-9,House>- 你知道秋水仙碱是什么么?- 不
<25-9,House>- You know what colchicine is?- No.

632
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:43,300
<25-11,House>别在意，是加味的
<25-11,House>Well,don't feel bad.It's for gout.

633
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:46,070
<25-11,House>跟你的假装症状毫无关系
<25-11,House>It's got nothing to dowith anything you've everpretended to have.

634
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:48,860
<25-12,Anica>- 我没假装- 闭嘴
<25-12,Anica>- I'm not pretending...- shut up.

636
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,490
<25-13,House>用此假装入院很高明
<25-13,House>It's great for fakingyour way into hospitals.

637
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:58,130
<25-14,Anica>- 我没假装……- 闭嘴
<25-14,Anica>- I didn't fake my way...- shut up.

638
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:01,350
<25-15,House>你经年累月这样做
<25-15,House>You've been doing this for years.

639
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,200
<25-15,House>别担心，这也许不是你的错
<25-15,House>Don't worry,it's probably not your fault.

640
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:08,570
<25-15,House>在你小的时候，你有个近亲有慢性病
<25-15,House>When you were a kid,you had a close relative who had a chronic disease,

641
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:10,860
<25-15,House>可能是姐妹
<25-15,House>probably your sister.

642
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:15,880
<25-15,House>当你被忽视的时候你看到她得到的注意
<25-15,House>You saw all the attention she got while you were left alone,ignored.

643
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:18,950
<25-15,House>而那当真把你伤害了
<25-15,House>And it really seriously screwed you up.

644
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:21,510
<25-16,Anica>- 我没有……- 闭嘴
<25-16,Anica>- I do not have a relative.. - shut up!

645
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:23,980
<25-17,House>我给你你想要的
<25-17,House>I'm trying to give you what you want.

646
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:30,490
<25-17,House>挽救你的生命
<25-17,House>And save your life.

647
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:33,310
<25-17,House>你得了再障贫血
<25-17,House>You have aplastic anemia.

648
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:35,970
<25-18,Anica>什么，你想吓唬我么?
<25-18,Anica>What,are you trying to scare me now?

649
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:39,300
<25-18,Anica>也就是说你不光只脑子有毛病
<25-18,Anica>It means you're not just sick in the head.

650
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:41,700
<25-19,House>问题是你的其他部分良好
<25-19,House>The problem is,the rest of you appears well.

651
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:44,370
<25-19,House>所以我需要让你看上去病的很重
<25-19,House>So I've got to make you seem as sick as you're supposed to be

652
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:48,970
<25-19,House>我得给你注射与你症状相符的药物使你看上去病情严重
<25-19,House>by injecting you with a drug that simulates the symptomsthat you actually have.

653
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:54,220
<25-19,House>你需要知道的是……
<25-19,House>All you need to know is...

654
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,870
<25-19,House>你击中了妄想症的筹码
<25-19,House>you've hitthe munchausen's jackpot.

655
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:59,770
<25-19,House>我会给你一份胰岛素鸡尾酒让你抽搐
<25-19,House>I'm gonna give you a cocktail of insulin for a seizure

656
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:03,040
<25-19,House>用秋水仙碱来杀死白血球
<25-19,House>and colchicine to kill your white count,

657
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:06,670
<25-19,House>这就会完全证实我关于再障贫血的诊断
<25-19,House>this will absolutelyconfirm my diagnosis of aplastic anemia.

658
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:09,900
<25-19,House>有一个小问题
<25-19,House>There is one small catch.

659
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:13,420
<25-19,House>如果你真做了什么导致自己贫血
<25-19,House>If you've actually done something to yourself  to cause the anemia,

660
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:15,390
<23-8,House>那我就错了
<23-8,House>then I'm wrong.

661
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:18,270
<23-9,Chase>而如果我做了我要做的
<23-9,Chase>And if I do what I plan to do,

662
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:21,260
<25-19,House>那治疗会导致你死亡而不是生存
<25-19,House>then the treatment will kill you instead of saving you.

663
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,450
<25-19,House>所以我需要知道
<25-19,House>So I need to know.

664
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:27,940
<25-19,House>除了胰岛素和激素
<25-19,House>Have you been taking anything besides the insulin,the acth,

665
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:31,070
<25-19,House>以及卡麦伦留下的药以外还吃了什么?
<25-19,House>and the pills cameron left in your room?

666
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,760
<25-20,Anica>没
<25-20,Anica>No.

667
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:43,860
<25-21,House>好，把胳膊给我
<25-21,House>Good.Give me your arm.

668
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:55,670
<25-22,Anica>是我妈妈
<25-22,Anica>It was my mom.

669
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:57,680
<25-22,Anica>她得了ms
<25-22,Anica>She had ms.

670
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,760
<25-22,Anica>她总出入医院
<25-22,Anica>She was in and outof hospitals all the time.

671
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:05,050
<25-22,Anica>人们总在为她做事
<25-22,Anica>People were always trying to do things for her.

672
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:08,140
<25-22,Anica>给她拿吃的，帮她梳头...
<25-22,Anica>Bring her food or brush her hair,or...

673
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,580
<25-22,Anica>让她快乐
<25-22,Anica>make her happy.

674
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,620
<25-22,Anica>人们记挂她
<25-22,Anica>People cared.

675
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:19,220
<25-22,Anica>我16岁时她死了
<25-22,Anica>She died when I was 16.

676
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:25,530
<25-22,Anica>然后就谁都没了
<25-22,Anica>Then there was no one.

677
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:30,790
<25-23,House>哦吼
<25-23,House>Boo hoo.

678
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,860
<25-24,Anica>你去哪?
<25-24,Anica>Where are you going?

679
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,990
<25-25,House>哦，当事情发生时我不能在场
<25-25,House>Well,I obviously can'tbe around when it happens.

680
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:40,050
<25-26,Anica>你要干嘛？你就打算……
<25-26,Anica>Well,what are you gonna do?You're just gonna--

681
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,990
<25-27,House>放松，你知道细节
<25-27,House>relax. You know the drill.

682
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:47,850
<25-27,House>总有人路过，你会没事的
<25-27,House>People walk by here all the time. You'll be fine.

683
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,660
<26-1,Foreman>她又抽筋了
<26-1,Foreman>And she has another seizure.

684
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:16,030
<26-2,Chase>她肯定是在出去的时候顺手拿了点胰岛素
<26-2,Chase>She must've somehow grabbedinsulin on her way out.

685
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:18,260
<26-3,Foreman>等她稳定了，我们得把她弄走
<26-3,Foreman>once she's stable,we need to get her out of here

686
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,360
<26-3,Foreman>在她再伤害自己之前.
<26-3,Foreman>before she does more damage to herself.

687
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:21,800
<26-3,Foreman>我们不能
<26-3,Foreman>We can'T.

688
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,440
<26-4,Cameron>她白血球下降了
<26-4,Cameron>Her white count's down.

689
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,940
<26-5,House>对不起，我错过了
<26-5,House>Sorry,I missed that.

690
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:29,770

<26-5,House>Hearing's been off sincethe ricky martin concert. Some

<26-5,House>有人踢了我的头
<26-5,House>cholo kicked me in the head.

692
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:34,620
<26-6,Foreman>白血球、血总值和血小板都没了
<26-6,Foreman>White count,hematocrit,and platelets are all off.

693
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,970
<26-6,Foreman>她的骨髓关闭了
<26-6,Foreman>Her bone marrow's shutting down.

694
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,580
<26-6,Foreman>她真有再障贫血
<26-6,Foreman>She actually hasaplastic anemia.

695
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:38,680
<26-7,House>说什么?
<26-7,House>Say what?

696
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:42,320
<26-8,Cameron>-她其他数据都没事- 数据狗屁
<26-8,Cameron>- all her other labs show nothing that would...- labs,shmabs

697
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,900
<26-9,House>好的诊断专家可以从数据中找问题
<26-9,House>A good diagnostician readsbetween the labs.

698
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,210
<26-10,Foreman>你对了
<26-10,Foreman>You were right.

699
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:50,440
<26-11,House>嘿，我们可不是在这抱怨
<26-11,House>Hey,hey,hey.We are not here to play the blame game

700
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,940
<26-11,House>会发生这样的事
<26-11,House>These things happen.

701
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:55,310
<26-11,House>有时医生会把病人撵出去受死
<26-11,House>Sometimes doctors send people out on the street to die

702
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:59,170
<26-11,House>在被别的医生警告后依然把病人撵出去受死
<26-11,House>after other doctors warned them that they're sendingpeople out on the street to die.

703
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,320
<26-11,House>你不可能知道
<26-11,House>There's no way you could know.

704
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,790
<26-12,Foreman>我去给她这个消息
<26-12,Foreman>I'll go give her the news.

705
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:13,580
<27-1,Anica>你是谁?
<27-1,Anica>Who are you?

706
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:15,200
<27-1,Anica>我是福满医生
<27-1,Anica>I'm dr. Foreman.

707
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:17,600
<27-2,Foreman>我负责你的病例
<27-2,Foreman>I'm in charge of your case.

708
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:21,030
<27-2,Foreman>你得了再障贫血
<27-2,Foreman>You have aplastic anemia.

709
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,680
<27-2,Foreman>意味着你的骨髓失效了
<27-2,Foreman>Which means your bone marrow has shut down.

710
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:26,680
<27-2,Foreman>你的身体拒绝造血
<27-2,Foreman>And your body can't make new blood anymore.

711
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,870
<27-3,Anica>你肯定吗？
<27-3,Anica>Are you sure?

712
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:31,200
<27-4,Foreman>我查了你的旧病例
<27-4,Foreman>I went back and checked your old records.

713
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:33,140
<27-4,Foreman>是合理的
<27-4,Foreman>It makes sense.

714
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:37,150
<27-4,Foreman>再障贫血已经发展几个月了
<27-4,Foreman>The aplastic anemia's apparently been developing for months.

715
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:40,590
<27-4,Foreman>我很抱歉，我们该早发现的
<27-4,Foreman>I'm sorry,we should've caught it earlier.

716
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:42,030
<27-4,Foreman>那……
<27-4,Foreman>So...

717
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:46,670
<27-5,Anica>并不是最近的白血球读数导致的……
<27-5,Anica>it's not just the latestwhite count that's leading you to feel this--

718
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,120
<27-6,Foreman>我知道这很可怕
<27-6,Foreman>I know this is scary.

719
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:54,400
<27-6,Foreman>但骨髓移植可以治愈
<27-6,Foreman>But a bone marrow transplant could cure you.

720
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:56,990
<27-7,Anica>骨髓移植会要我命
<27-7,Anica>A marrow transplant could kill me.

721
00:35:57,130 --> 00:36:00,360
<27-8,Foreman>还有个方法是周换血
<27-8,Foreman>The other option is weekly blood transfusions.

722
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,940
<27-8,Foreman>注射gcsf
<27-8,Foreman>Injections of gcsf.

723
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,810
<27-8,Foreman>是终生制的
<27-8,Foreman>It's a life-long regimen.

724
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,700
<27-9,Anica>对，我不要
<27-9,Anica>Yeah,I don't want that.

725
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,450
<27-9,Anica>你肯定?
<27-9,Anica>You sure?

726
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:13,510
<27-10,Foreman>我不想狠心
<27-10,Foreman>I-I don't want to be cruel here, but

727
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:17,030
<27-10,Foreman>但你做了很多努力得到这样的注意
<27-10,Foreman>you jumped througha lot of hoops to get this sort of attention.

728
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:20,310
<27-11,Anica>我就是想健康
<27-11,Anica>I just want to be healthy.

729
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:24,690
<27-12,Foreman>而你病的时候就没那么多乐趣了
<27-12,Foreman>It's not so much funwhen you're actually sick.

730
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,800
<27-13,Anica>不
<27-13,Anica>No.

731
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,150
<27-14,Foreman>我们会……查查登记处
<27-14,Foreman>We'll,um--we'll check the registry.

732
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:37,370
<27-14,Foreman>看是否有捐赠者
<27-14,Foreman>See if there's a donor match.

733
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:41,900
<27-15,Anica>谢谢
<27-15,Anica>Thank you.

735
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,050
<27-15,Anica>你就没有免疫系统了
<27-15,Anica>You'll have no immune system.

736
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,230
<28-1,Wilson>我们会把你留在无菌室 确保一切都死了
<28-1,Wilson>We'll keep you in a sterile room for two weeks to make sure everything's dead.

737
00:36:56,370 --> 00:36:57,990
<28-1,Wilson>然后给你捐赠的骨髓
<28-1,Wilson>Then we'll give you the donor marrow.

738
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,760
<28-1,Wilson>然后再用数周使其稳定
<28-1,Wilson>It'll take another couple weeks until it takes hold.

739
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,780
<28-1,Wilson>你感觉不到什么
<28-1,Wilson>You won't feel a thing.

740
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:05,010
<28-1,Wilson>如果你觉得不舒服，或需要什么
<28-1,Wilson>If you get uncomfortable for any reason and need to talk,

741
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:06,250
<28-1,Wilson>别喊
<28-1,Wilson>don't yell.

742
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,920
<28-1,Wilson>墙有4英尺厚
<28-1,Wilson>Walls are four inches thick.

743
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,020
<28-1,Wilson>向前
<28-1,Wilson>Lead.

744
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:11,110
<28-1,Wilson>用麦克风
<28-1,Wilson>Use the microphone.

745
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:13,420
<28-1,Wilson>准备好了么?
<28-1,Wilson>Are you ready?

746
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:15,490
<28-1,Wilson>好
<28-1,Wilson>Okay.

747
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,820
<28-1,Wilson>豪斯医生在哪?
<28-1,Wilson>Where's dr. House?

748
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:12,930
<29-1,House>关掉
<29-1,House>Turn it off.

749
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:16,230
<29-3,House>- 怎么了? - 她在里面多久了?
<29-3,House>- Now what?- How long has she been in there?

750
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:18,370
<29-4,Wilson>3分钟，怎么了?
<29-4,Wilson>Three minutes.What's going on?

751
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:20,320
<29-5,House>她没有再障贫血
<29-5,House>She doesn't haveaplastic anemia.

752
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:21,830
<29-5,House>她感染了
<29-5,House>She has an infection.

753
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:23,980
<29-6,Cameron>不，她的白血球高的惊人
<29-6,Cameron>No. Her white count would bethrough the roof.

754
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:25,520
<29-6,Cameron>这就是
<29-6,Cameron>Hers is one the floor.

755
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,340
<29-6,Cameron>身体干疯狂的事
<29-6,Cameron>Well,the bodydoes crazy things.

756
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,320
<29-7,House>"身体干疯狂的事"
<29-7,House>"The body does crazy things."

757
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:30,390
<29-8,Foreman>那就都解释了
<29-8,Foreman>Well,that explains everything.

758
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,480
<29-9,Chase>她不发热
<29-9,Chase>She had no fever.

759
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:35,070
<29-10,House>因为她自己制造库欣症压制免疫系统
<29-10,House>'Cause her self-inflictedcushing's suppressed her immune system.

760
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:38,620
<29-10,House>使她不发热，抑制感染
<29-10,House>Stopped her from having a fever.Hid the infection.

761
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:43,970
<29-10,House>梭菌可导致瘀伤、细胞分裂和贫血
<29-10,House>Clostridium perfringenscould cause the bruises, schistocytes,the anemia--

762
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:46,810
<29-11,Chase>都能解释除了白血球的问题
<29-11,Chase>explains everything except the white count.

763
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:50,210
<29-12,House>查证比摧毁她的免疫系统安全的多
<29-12,House>Augmentin is a lot safer than destroying her immune system.

764
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,410
<29-12,House>干嘛不试试?
<29-12,House>Why don't we try that?

765
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,400
<29-13,Foreman>你要选择安全路径?
<29-13,Foreman>you're taking the safe course?

766
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,190
<29-13,Foreman>怎么回事?
<29-13,Foreman>What's going on?

767
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,510
<29-14,House>白血球低有很多原因
<29-14,House>There's lots of explanations for a low white count.

768
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:04,870
<29-15,Cameron>说一种符合她的症状
<29-15,Cameron>Name one that fits her case.

769
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,570
<29-16,House>秋水仙碱
<29-16,House>Colchicine.

770
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:17,080
<29-16,House>我猜她能拿到
<29-16,House>I figure that she'd gottenher hands on it

771
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,400
<29-16,House>就自己给药了
<29-16,House>and,uh,just self-medicated.

772
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:21,710
<29-17,Foreman>她多聪明
<29-17,Foreman>That's brilliant of her!

773
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:27,190
<29-17,Foreman>用了正好可以证实你诊断的药
<29-17,Foreman>Take the exact medication that would confirm your diagnosis.

774
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:29,950
<29-18,House>人们会做疯狂的事
<29-18,House>People do crazy things.

775
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,830
<29-19,Foreman>你给她用药 违背她的意愿以证实自己对?
<29-19,Foreman>You injected heragainst her will just so you could be right?

776
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,150
<29-21,Foreman>- 她同意- 她精神有病
<29-21,Foreman>- She consented. - She's mentally ill!

777
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,770
<29-22,House>她闻上去非常甜美
<29-22,House>But she smells oh so sweet.

778
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,330
<30-1,House>我让说她严重的时候她该变严重
<30-1,House>She would've gotten sickerwhen I said she was gonna get sicker,

779
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,420
<30-1,House>而卡麦伦给了她抗生素
<30-1,House>except cameron dosed herwith antibiotics.

780
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,520
<30-1,House>拿好
<30-1,House>Just hold this.

781
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:46,630
<30-2,Anica>一切都好么?
<30-2,Anica>Is everything okay?

782
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,670
<30-2,Anica>拉我的手指
<30-2,Anica>Pull my finger.

783
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,350
<30-3,House>象葡萄似的
<30-3,House>Grapey.

784
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:55,750
<30-3,House>你有细菌
<30-3,House>You have a bacterium.

785
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,250
<30-3,House>大家都有
<30-3,House>It's on all of us.

786
00:39:57,410 --> 00:40:00,700
<30-3,House>而你给自己库欣症的伤痕 却给了它一个家
<30-3,House>But the bruises you gave yourself with the cushing'smade a lovely home.

787
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:05,500
<30-3,House>细菌搬进来，做了邻居
<30-3,House>Bacteria moved in,parked their cars on the lawn. There goes the neighborhood.

788
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:08,950
<30-3,House>邻居的意思是跟你的内脏
<30-3,House>By "neighborhood" I mean your internal organs.

789
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:11,680
<30-3,House>那么我们是不是该给她做点什么?
<30-3,House>So,should we put heron the augment in,boss?

790
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:14,610
<30-3,House>还是你觉得她自己注射了葡萄?
<30-3,House>Or do you think she injected herself with grapes?

791
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:18,780
<30-3,House>我喜欢闻这个
<30-3,House>I love the smell of pusin the morning.

792
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:20,900
<30-3,House>闻上去象...
<30-3,House>Smells like...

793
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,430
<30-3,House>胜利的味道
<30-3,House>victory.

794
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:29,340
<31-1,Foreman>如果你正式提议
<31-1,Foreman>If you were seriousabout the offer,

795
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:31,640
<31-1,Foreman>我会严肃接受
<31-1,Foreman>I'm serious about accepting.

796
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:34,050
<31-1,Foreman>我想掌管部门
<31-1,Foreman>I'd like to runthe department.

797
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:37,140
<31-1,Foreman>而且你自己说事情很顺畅
<31-1,Foreman>And you said it yourself,things run smooth.

798
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:39,960
<31-2,Cuddy>除了豪斯在你背后的行为
<31-2,Cuddy>Except for the part where housewent behind your back

799
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:43,260
<31-2,Cuddy>给病人用胰岛素和秋水仙碱
<31-2,Cuddy>and ko'd the patientwith insulin and colchicine.

800
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:45,940
<31-3,Foreman>没理由怀疑是感染
<31-3,Foreman>There was no reasonto suspect an infection.

801
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:48,680
<31-3,Foreman>连豪斯也没那么怀疑
<31-3,Foreman>Even house didn't thinkit was an infection.

802
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:50,540
<31-3,Foreman>你也会做同样的事
<31-3,Foreman>You would've donethe same thing I did.

803
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:52,740
<31-4,Cuddy>而我同样也会错
<31-4,Cuddy>And I'd be just as wrong.

804
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,770
<31-4,Cuddy>豪斯的作为很疯狂 却保存了她的性命
<31-4,Cuddy>What house did was insane.But he saved her life.

805
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:56,690
<31-5,Foreman>他很幸运
<31-5,Foreman>He got lucky.

806
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:58,880
<31-6,Cuddy>他让她承认自己有病
<31-6,Cuddy>He got her to admitshe's got a problem.

807
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:01,320
<31-6,Cuddy>她同意做院外处理
