1
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:19,750
<1-1,Pam>就现在怎样
<1-1,Pam>What do you say now?

2
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:22,330
<1-2,Keith>我不知道
<1-2,Keith>I don't know.

3
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,300
<1-3,Pam>你说你爸爸一小时内不会回来
<1-3,Pam>You said your dad wouldn't be home for an hour.

4
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,730
<1-4,Keith>没错  但你不知道
<1-4,Keith>I know, but you don't know

5
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:27,790
<1-5,Pam>难道你不爱我吗
<1-5,Pam>Don't you love me?

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,210
<1-6,Keith>当然  你知道我
<1-6,Keith>Of course. You know l-

7
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:30,570
<1-7,Pam>那还犹豫什么  来嘛
<1-7,Pam>Then, come on. Let's do it.

8
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:33,640
<1-8,Keith>好吧
<1-8,Keith>All right.

9
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:48,270
<1-9,Pam>-它们在哪儿  -床头柜里
<1-9,Pam>- Where are they?  - Nightstand.

10
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,370
<1-9,Pam>阁下  发动你的引擎吧
<1-9,Pam>Gentlemen, start your engines.

11
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:06,100
<2-1,Pam>我爱死这车啦
<2-1,Pam>I so want this car!

12
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,500
<2-2,Pam>哦天哪  你在流血
<2-2,Pam>Oh, my God! You're bleeding.

13
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,290
<2-3,Keith>小心
<2-3,Keith>Look out!

14
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,120
<3-1,House>他们又在扯什么谎
<3-1,House>What lie are they telling you?

15
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:40,250
<3-2,Pharmacist>我会核对的  好的  行
<3-2,Pharmacist>I'll check on it. Okay. Yes-

16
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,760
<3-3,House>快点儿  大哥
<3-3,House>Come on.

17
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:47,090
<3-3,House>好  谢谢
<3-3,House>Okay, thank you.

18
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,460
<3-4,Pharmacist>药物今早就已寄出
<3-4,Pharmacist>Okay, pharmaceuticals were delivered this morning.

19
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:51,490
<3-4,Pharmacist>但运输公司误将装有维科丁的药箱
<3-4,Pharmacist>But Shipping accidentally sent the box with Vicodin

20
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:52,470
<3-4,Pharmacist>送到了研究室
<3-4,Pharmacist>to Research.

21
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,780
<3-5,House>嗯  那还真是难办
<3-5,House>Hmm. That's a tough one.

22
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,050
<3-5,House>若我们能
<3-5,House>If only we had some way

23
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,840
<3-5,House>和那个部门协商一下就好了
<3-5,House>to communicate with another part of the building.

24
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,180
<3-5,House>16岁的孩子  机动车交通事故
<3-5,House>Sixteen-year-old M.V.A. victim.

25
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,080
<3-6,Cameron>他由于内出血
<3-6,Cameron>He's been in and out of the hospital

26
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,260
<3-6,Cameron>过去三周一直进进出出医院
<3-6,Cameron>for three weeks with internal bleeding.

27
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,940
<3-6,Cameron>没人能找出病因所在
<3-6,Cameron>No one can find the cause.

28
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,850
<3-7,House>车祸后内出血  哇  还真是震惊啊
<3-7,House>Internal bleeding after a car accident. Wow, that's shocking.

29
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:10,810
<3-7,House>让我和运输公司说  我有办法对付他们
<3-7,House>Let me talk to Shipping. I speak their language.

30
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:11,610
<3-8,Cameron>已经三个星期了
<3-8,Cameron>It's been three weeks-

31
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,050
<3-9,House>你的医院里没有我要的止痛药
<3-9,House>Your hospital doesn't have my pain medication.

32
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,610
<3-10,Pharmacist>运输公司说要一个小时才到
<3-10,Pharmacist>Shipping says it's going to be an hour.

33
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:18,620
<3-11,Cuddy>我是卡迪医生  怎么回事
<3-11,Cuddy>This is Dr. Cuddy. What's going on?

34
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,140
<3-12,Cameron>不是车祸引起的出血
<3-12,Cameron>The crash didn't cause the bleed.

35
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,370
<3-13,House>没错  是出血引起了车祸
<3-13,House>Right- the bleed caused the crash.

36
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:24,210
<3-13,House>血流到路上  车在路上打滑了
<3-13,House>Blood got on the road, got all slippery-

37
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:25,290
<3-13,House>谁身上带了药[毒品]
<3-13,House>Anyone here got drugs?

38
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,030
<3-14,Cameron>她看到他流血  就分心了
<3-14,Cameron>She saw his blood, she got distracted,

39
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,300
<3-14,Cameron>还把他爸爸的保时捷撞毁了
<3-14,Cameron>and she crashed his dad's Porsche.

40
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,570
<3-15,House>他爸爸会很高兴的
<3-15,House>Dad'll love that.

41
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:33,690
<3-16,Cameron>-他...  -别再说了
<3-16,Cameron>- He was-  - Don't talk.

42
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:35,160
<3-18,Cuddy>要等一个小时
<3-18,Cuddy>It's gonna be an hour.

43
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,480
<3-19,House>谢天谢地  你大局在握
<3-19,House>Thank God you took control.

44
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,840
<3-20,Cuddy>如果你等不了一个小时
<3-20,Cuddy>If you can't wait one hour to get-

45
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,300
<3-21,Cameron>那孩子患有溶血性贫血
<3-21,Cameron>Kid's got hemolytic anemia.

46
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:42,230
<3-22,Cuddy>孩子  多大
<3-22,Cuddy>Kid? How old?

47
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,850
<3-23,House>肯定是遗传  命不久矣
<3-23,House>He must have inherited it. He's gonna die.

48
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:45,700
<3-23,House>请节哀
<3-23,House>My condolences.

49
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:46,950
<3-23,House>不是遗传
<3-23,House>Wasn't inherited.

50
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,530
<3-24,Cameron>不是红细胞的问题
<3-24,Cameron>The problem's outside the red blood cells.

51
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:49,330
<3-25,Cuddy>这不可能
<3-25,Cuddy>This is impossible.

52
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,270
<3-25,Cuddy>16岁的孩子 不可能得溶血性贫血
<3-25,Cuddy>A 16-year-old does not get hemolytic anemia.

53
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,640
<3-26,House>把病历还给她
<3-26,House>Give her back the file.

54
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,280
<3-26,House>你有更重要的事情要处理  如帮我找药
<3-26,House>You have bigger problems to tend to, like my meds.

55
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,580
<3-27,Cuddy>间接胆红素偏高  血清结合珠蛋白水平偏低
<3-27,Cuddy>Elevated indirect bilirubin, low serum haptoglobin-

56
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:01,170
<3-28,House>-他有脑膜炎  -没有
<3-28,House>- He's got meningitis. - Uh, no.

57
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,810
<3-30,House>-人工心脏瓣膜  -没有
<3-30,House>- Artificial heart valve. - No.

58
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,890
<3-32,House>叫大伙儿到我办公室集合
<3-32,House>Get everyone in my office.

59
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,010
<4-1,House>若不尽快找出他红细胞溶解的原因
<4-1,House>Kid's gonna be dead in a matter of days...

60
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:19,940
<4-1,House>几天之内就会没命
<4-1,House>if we don't figure out why his red blood cells are disintegrating.

61
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:22,140
<4-1,House>说说你们的鉴别诊断吧  同志们
<4-1,House>So, differential diagnosis, people.

62
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,370
<4-2,Foreman>不是环境所致
<4-2,Foreman>Well, it's not environmental.

63
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,260
<4-2,Foreman>他爸爸雇了清洁工清理房子
<4-2,Foreman>Dad hired a company to clean the house.

64
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,670
<4-2,Foreman>女佣洗了所有的衣物
<4-2,Foreman>Maid washed all the clothes...

65
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,680
<4-2,Foreman>还买了低过敏性床单和枕头
<4-2,Foreman>and bought hypoallergenic sheets and pillows.

66
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,680
<4-3,Chase>-要重新检查一下吗  -没必要
<4-3,Chase>- You want us to recheck?  - No.

67
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,710
<4-4,House>若和环境有关  在这儿他该好转才是
<4-4,House>If it's environmental, he'll get better just from staying here.

68
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:33,750
<4-5,Foreman>有可能是感染
<4-5,Foreman>It could be an infection.

69
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,220
<4-6,Cameron>没发烧  白细胞也没增加
<4-6,Cameron>No fever. No white count.

70
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,790
<4-7,Foreman>但他的体温有99.2[华氏]
<4-7,Foreman>Well, he's 99.2.

71
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:37,950
<4-8,Cameron>只比正常体温高一点点
<4-8,Cameron>Barely above normal.

72
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,170
<4-9,Foreman>但还是高了  他的身体在对什么起反应
<4-9,Foreman>But above. His body's reacting to something.

73
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,200
<4-10,Cameron>若是红斑狼疮的话  就能解释
<4-10,Cameron>We could account for the lack

74
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,810
<4-10,Cameron>为什么没发烧  白细胞也没增加了
<4-10,Cameron>of fever and white count if it's lupus.

75
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,800
<4-11,Chase>吸毒也可以出现与红斑狼疮类似的症状
<4-11,Chase>Drugs will fit just as much as lupus.

76
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,510
<4-11,Chase>冰毒会引起溶血性贫血
<4-11,Chase>Meth will cause hemolytic anemia.

77
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:48,930
<4-12,Cameron>要大量冰毒才行
<4-12,Cameron>A lot of meth.

78
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,990
<4-13,Foreman>而且他看起来也不像这种人
<4-13,Foreman>Also doesn't exactly seem like the type.

79
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,920
<4-14,Chase>因为他爸爸开的是保时捷吗
<4-14,Chase>Because his dad drives a Porsche?

80
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,610
<4-14,Chase>富家子弟也和穷人的孩子一样吸毒
<4-14,Chase>Rich kids do drugs just like poor kids.

81
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:56,910
<4-15,Foreman>没想冒犯你
<4-15,Foreman>Didn't mean to offend you.

82
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:58,550
<4-16,House>好啦  也就是说病因可能是
<4-16,House>Okay.! So it's

83
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:01,850
<4-16,House>感染  红斑狼疮  毒品或癌症
<4-16,House>infection, lupus, drugs or cancer.

84
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:02,560
<4-17,Cameron>癌症
<4-17,Cameron>Cancer?

85
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,570
<4-18,House>为什么不可能  很棒的会议
<4-18,House>Why not? Great meeting.

86
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,380
<4-19,Cameron>会议结束前  不需要再缩小可能性吗
<4-19,Cameron>Shouldn't we narrow it down before we finish?

87
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,860
<4-20,House>我的腿只能坚持到十一点一刻
<4-20,House>My leg gave us till 11:15.

88
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:10,950
<4-20,House>我去和威尔森讨论淋巴瘤的可能性
<4-20,House>I'll talk to Wilson about lymphoma,

89
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,270
<4-20,House>做抗核抗体检查  看是否是红斑狼疮
<4-20,House>A.N.A. for lupus,

90
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,540
<4-20,House>还有放射免疫检验  检查毒品
<4-20,House>radioimmunoassay for drugs,

91
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,900
<4-20,House>你们就去检查所有你们认为可能的病因
<4-20,House>and you test for whatever you thought it was.

92
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,370
<4-20,House>我和药剂师有个约会
<4-20,House>I've got a date with the pharmacist.

93
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,770
<4-20,House>这个已经解决了  还有
<4-20,House>That's already done, and-

94
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:25,210
<5-1,House>快点  快快快
<5-1,House>Come on! Come on, come on, come on.

95
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,270
<5-1,House>就是这个
<5-1,House>Yeah.

96
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,170
<5-2,Cuddy>稍等一下
<5-2,Cuddy>Excuse me.

97
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,950
<5-2,Cuddy>知不知道  止痛的方法可不止这一个
<5-2,Cuddy>You know, there are other ways to manage pain.

98
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:46,680
<5-3,House>比如呢  大笑  冥想
<5-3,House>Like what? Laughter? Meditation?

99
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:49,230
<5-3,House>还是有人能治好我的第三脉轮
<5-3,House>Got a guy that can fix my third chakra?

100
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:50,870
<5-4,Cuddy>你已经上瘾了
<5-4,Cuddy>You're addicted.

101
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,020
<5-5,House>靠止痛药过活才叫上瘾
<5-5,House>If the pills ran my life, I'd agree with you,

102
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,980
<5-5,House>但是我的腿让我无法专心做事
<5-5,House>but it's my leg that's busy calendaring what I can't do.

103
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,480
<5-6,Cuddy>你这是否认期的表现
<5-6,Cuddy>You're in denial.

104
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:59,530
<5-7,House>是啊  我的腿从来没有梗死过
<5-7,House>Right. I never had an infarction in my leg.

105
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:01,270
<5-7,House>肌肉没坏死  神经也没受损
<5-7,House>No dead muscle, no nerve damage.

106
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:04,390
<5-7,House>甚至一点都不疼  事实上像在挠痒
<5-7,House>Doesn't even hurt. Actually, it kinda tickles.

107
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:07,030
<5-7,House>而小鸡比小狗更擅长这个
<5-7,House>And chicks dig this... better than a puppy.

108
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:10,280
<5-8,Cuddy>不只是你腿的问题  是你想兴奋起来
<5-8,Cuddy>It's not just your leg. You wanna get high.

109
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,470
<5-8,Cuddy>你每天用多少  八十毫克吗
<5-8,Cuddy>You're doing, what, 80 milligrams a day?

110
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:13,980
<5-9,House>没有  那太多了
<5-9,House>No. That's way too much.

111
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:16,980
<5-9,House>节制是关键  除非疼痛折磨
<5-9,House>Moderation is the key. Unless there's pain.

112
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,060
<5-10,Cuddy>现在的剂量是我雇你时的两倍了
<5-10,Cuddy>It's double what you were taking when I hired you.

113
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,040
<5-11,House>因为你比那时候烦人两倍
<5-11,House>'Cause you're twice as annoying.

114
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,530
<5-12,Cuddy>我不可能总是包庇你
<5-12,Cuddy>I can't always be here to protect you.

115
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:26,340
<5-12,Cuddy>病人在议论  医生也在议论
<5-12,Cuddy>Patients talk. Doctors talk.

116
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,600
<5-13,House>议论你的屁屁最近又翘了多少
<5-13,House>About how big your ass has gotten lately?

117
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,200
<5-13,House>没谈论我  我申辩
<5-13,House>Not me. I defend it.

118
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,900
<5-13,House>你东山再起了
<5-13,House>You got back.

119
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,490
<6-2,House>没止痛药你一星期都忍受不了
<6-2,House>You can't go a week without the drugs.

120
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,720
<6-2,House>是的  我也不想
<6-2,House>No, I don't wanna go without the drugs.

121
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,860
<6-3,Cuddy>-腿会疼  -不  是你做不到
<6-3,Cuddy>- It'll hurt.  - No, you can't.

122
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,360
<6-3,Cuddy>如果你是停用止疼药  你会疼
<6-3,Cuddy>If you're just getting off pain medication, it will hurt.

123
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:50,780
<6-3,Cuddy>你会很难受  但你可以挺过去
<6-3,Cuddy>You won't be having a great time, but you'll make it.

124
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:54,200
<6-3,Cuddy>而若是戒毒的话  你会寒颤  恶心
<6-3,Cuddy>If you're detoxing, you'll have chills, nausea.

125
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,200
<6-3,Cuddy>你的疼痛会是现在的五倍  甚至十倍
<6-3,Cuddy>Your pain will magnify five, ten times.

126
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,560
<6-3,Cuddy>那时你就熬不过去了
<6-3,Cuddy>You won't make it.

127
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,140
<6-4,House>唉  我看我们没机会知道了
<6-4,House>Well, I guess we'll never know.

128
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:02,270
<6-5,Cuddy>如果你能坚持一星期不嗑药的话
<6-5,Cuddy>I'll give you a week off clinic duty

129
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,140
<6-5,Cuddy>你一星期不用坐门诊
<6-5,Cuddy>if you can go a week without narcotics.

130
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:05,200
<6-6,House>我才不干呢  我爱门诊
<6-6,House>No way. I love the clinic.

131
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,310
<6-7,Cuddy>你是爱止痛药  两星期
<6-7,Cuddy>You love the pills. Two weeks.

132
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,320
<6-8,House>止痛药不会让我兴奋  是让我恢复正常
<6-8,House>The pills don't make me high. They make me neutral.

133
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,010
<6-9,Cuddy>一个月
<6-9,Cuddy>A month.

134
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,570
<6-10,House>你得逞了  女士
<6-10,House>You're on, mister.

135
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,240
<7-1,Dad>他的病是毒品引起的吗
<7-1,Dad>Drugs could cause this?

136
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,570
<7-2,Cameron>可卡因和冰毒对血液系统影响非常严重
<7-2,Cameron>Cocaine and meth are very hard on the blood system.

137
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,990
<7-2,Cameron>他有什么古怪行为吗
<7-2,Cameron>Has he had any erratic behavior?

138
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,420
<7-2,Cameron>没有  但是
<7-2,Cameron>No, but-

139
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,690
<7-3,Dad>她在戒毒中  到第九级了
<7-3,Dad>She was in rehab in the ninth grade.

140
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:36,320
<7-3,Dad>现在应该已经戒清了  但...
<7-3,Dad>She's supposedly clean now, but-

141
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,410
<7-4,Cameron>她明显很关心他
<7-4,Cameron>She obviously cares for him.

142
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,540
<7-5,Dad>是吗  她关心的是那辆车
<7-5,Dad>Yeah, what she cared about was the car.

143
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,140
<7-5,Dad>那是给我妻子的周年礼物
<7-5,Dad>Anniversary present for my wife.

144
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:46,210
<7-5,Dad>我们开着它到北方去看叶子变化
<7-5,Dad>We drove it up north to watch the leaves change.

145
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:48,230
<7-5,Dad>一年后她就死了
<7-5,Dad>She was dead a year later.

146
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:50,760
<7-5,Dad>-是癌症  -很抱歉
<7-5,Dad>- Cancer.  - I'm sorry.

147
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:56,060
<7-6,Cameron>福斯特先生  我们会给凯斯做毒品检测
<7-6,Cameron>Mr. Foster, we're gonna test Keith for drugs.

148
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:58,070
<8-1,Keith>我  我不吸毒的
<8-1,Keith>I- I don't do drugs.

149
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,870
<8-2,Chase>并不是我们不相信你  而是
<8-2,Chase>It's not that we don't trust you, but-

150
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:03,620
<9-1,Cameron>从他的头发中可以检测出
<9-1,Cameron>His hair will tell us any drugs

151
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:06,270
<9-1,Cameron>他在过去两个月之内服用过的任何毒品
<9-1,Cameron>he's taken over the past 60 days.

152
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:09,340
<9-1,Cameron>其原理有点类似树上的年轮
<9-1,Cameron>It's kind of like rings on a tree.

153
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,910
<9-2,Chase>阴性
<9-2,Chase>Negative.

154
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:21,620
<9-3,Cameron>-你有没有患过什么重病  -没有
<9-3,Cameron>- Have you been sick? - No, nothing.

155
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:23,040
<9-5,Cameron>有没有出过国
<9-5,Cameron>Have you been out of the country?

156
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,250
<9-6,Dad>我们去过中国  但离开前我们都打过疫苗
<9-6,Dad>We went to China, but we got all our shots before we left.

157
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,020
<9-6,Dad>有可能是感染
<9-6,Dad>It could be an infection.

158
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:30,580
<10-1,Cameron>我们将对他进行镓扫描   以防万一
<10-1,Cameron>We're going to give him a gallium scan just to be safe.

159
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,210
<10-1,Cameron>我们将放射性同位素注射进他的血流中
<10-1,Cameron>We inject a radioactive isotope into his bloodstream,

160
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:35,940
<10-1,Cameron>然后检查  看他的体内有没有炎症
<10-1,Cameron>and we check to see if there's inflammation anywhere in the body.

161
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,750
<10-2,Cameron>他有没有提过关节痛
<10-2,Cameron>Has he ever complained of any joint pain?

162
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,670
<10-2,Cameron>对光敏感  或者出疹子
<10-2,Cameron>Sensitivity to light? Rashes?

163
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:43,800
<10-3,Dad>没有  从没说过
<10-3,Dad>No, no. Nothing.

164
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,100
<10-4,Cameron>有亲戚得过红斑狼疮吗
<10-4,Cameron>Any relatives who've ever been diagnosed with lupus?

165
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,240
<10-5,Dad>我都不知道这是什么病
<10-5,Dad>I don't even know what that is.

166
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,240
<10-6,Cameron>简单说  就是身体自身过敏
<10-6,Cameron>In simple terms, the body becomes allergic to itself.

167
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,790
<10-6,Cameron>免疫系统攻击并消灭
<10-6,Cameron>The immune system attacks

168
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:54,930
<10-6,Cameron>循环系统中健康的细胞
<10-6,Cameron>healthy cells in the circulatory system and destroys them.

169
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,340
<10-7,Dad>能治疗吗
<10-7,Dad>Would it be treatable?

170
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:59,630
<10-8,Cameron>可以进行控制
<10-8,Cameron>It can be manageable.

171
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:01,780
<11-1,Cameron>我们能检查他的抗体
<11-1,Cameron>We can test for the antibodies.

172
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:05,870
<11-1,Cameron>95%的红斑狼疮患者的抗核抗体都呈阳性
<11-1,Cameron>Ninety-five percent of patients with lupus have positive A.N.A.

173
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,950
<11-2,Foreman>没有变浑浊  是阴性
<11-2,Foreman>Not cloudy. Negative.

174
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,240
<11-3,Cameron>那么有没有挫伤
<11-3,Cameron>What about bruising?

175
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:15,180
<11-3,Cameron>他从未说过腋下或腹股沟处有压痛吗
<11-3,Cameron>Never complained of tenderness under his arms or his groin?

176
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,340
<11-4,Dad>就算有  恐怕他也不会告诉我
<11-4,Dad>I'm not sure he'd tell me if he did.

177
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,820
<11-4,Dad>我想我都不知道他生活是怎样的
<11-4,Dad>I guess I don't really know what's going on in his life.

178
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,720
<11-5,Cameron>-他还是个青少年  -是啊
<11-5,Cameron>- He's a teenager. - Yeah.

179
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,690
<11-5,Cameron>你妻子患的是什么癌症呢
<11-5,Cameron>What type of cancer did your wife have?

180
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,600
<11-6,Dad>胰腺癌
<11-6,Dad>Pancreatic.

181
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,700
<11-7,Cameron>我们担心他的淋巴结有问题
<11-7,Cameron>It's his lymph nodes we're concerned about.

182
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:40,210
<11-7,Cameron>我们将做活检  看是否是淋巴瘤
<11-7,Cameron>We're going to do a biopsy to check for lymphoma.

183
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,130
<12-1,Wilson>-有感觉吗  -没有
<12-1,Wilson>- Can you feel this?  - No.

184
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:45,690
<12-3,Wilson>很好
<12-3,Wilson>Good.

185
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,940
<12-4,Keith>我得了癌症  是吗
<12-4,Keith>I have cancer, don't I?

186
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,560
<12-5,Wilson>我们只是在做检查
<12-5,Wilson>We're just testing.

187
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,410
<12-6,Keith>那时他们也是这样对我妈妈说的
<12-6,Keith>That's what they told my mom.

188
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:12,650
<13-1,Wilson>绝对不是癌症
<13-1,Wilson>Definitely not cancer.

189
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,710
<13-1,Wilson>-什么都没发现  -一无所获
<13-1,Wilson>- Nothing? - Nothing.

190
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:17,440
<14-1,House>毒品检测抗核抗体检查均为阴性
<14-1,House>Negative for drugs. A.N.A. Was negative.

191
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,450
<14-2,Cameron>镓扫描也没什么可疑迹象
<14-2,Cameron>Gallium scan was clear.

192
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:20,460
<14-3,Chase>是的  我知道一无所获是什么意思
<14-3,Chase>Yeah, I got that from the "Nothing."

193
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:22,790
<14-4,House>-他的血球容量是多少  -13
<14-4,House>- Where's his hematocrit?  - Thirteen.

194
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:23,810
<14-5,Foreman>如果再降低  他的红细胞
<14-5,Foreman>Drops any lower, he's not gonna have

195
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:26,320
<14-6,Wilson>将不足以携带足够的氧气供给全身
<14-6,Wilson>enough red blood cells to bring oxygen to his body.

196
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,560
<14-6,Wilson>到时他的肺部功能正常  但他会窒息而死
<14-6,Wilson>He'll suffocate with his lungs working perfectly.

197
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,160
<14-7,Foreman>你还好吗
<14-7,Foreman>You okay?

198
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:33,430
<14-8,Keith>不好意思  有人在吗  救命
<14-8,Keith>Excuse me, someone? Help. Please!

199
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,000
<14-9,House>这个将死的娃还挺有礼貌
<14-9,House>Polite for a dying kid.

200
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,570
<14-10,Wilson>已经坚持多久了
<14-10,Wilson>How long has it been?

201
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:44,580
<14-11,House>我好着呢
<14-11,House>I'm fine.

202
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:47,180
<15-1,Keith>-我眼睛上面有东西  -哪只眼睛
<15-1,Keith>- There's something in my eye. Up at the top. - Which eye?

203
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,380
<15-3,Keith>这只  怎么回事
<15-3,Keith>This one. What's happening?

204
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,580
<15-4,Chase>没事的  向下看
<15-4,Chase>It's all right. Just look down for me.

205
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:56,090
<15-4,Chase>很干净  没有异物
<15-4,Chase>It's clear. There's nothing in it.

206
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,190
<15-6,Cameron>-越来越糟了  -有模糊感还是
<15-6,Cameron>- It's getting worse. - Is it fuzzy or-

207
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,290
<15-7,Keith>不是  完全变黑了
<15-7,Keith>No, it's dark.

208
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,660
<15-7,Keith>我看不见了
<15-7,Keith>I can't see.

209
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,130
<16-1,Foreman>左眼视网膜血栓
<16-1,Foreman>It's a retinal clot in the left eye.

210
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:21,630
<16-2,Cameron>华法林可以溶解血栓  恢复视力
<16-2,Cameron>Coumadin would dissolve the clot, fix his eyesight.

211
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,630
<16-3,Chase>现在不能使用抗凝血剂  他有内出血
<16-3,Chase>You can't use blood thinners. He's got internal bleeding.

212
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,980
<16-3,Chase>可以恢复视力  但会毁了其他的一切
<16-3,Chase>Fix the eye, you'd kill everything else.

213
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,000
<16-4,Foreman>同样的原因  也不能手术
<16-4,Foreman>Surgery's out for the same reason.

214
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:29,550
<16-5,Chase>我们有两个小时的时间解决这个问题
<16-5,Chase>We have two hours to figure this out.

215
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:31,700
<16-5,Chase>要是无法恢复血流量  他的眼睛就保不住了
<16-5,Chase>Either we restore the blood flow, or he loses the eye.

216
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,910
<16-6,House>别管眼睛了
<16-6,House>Forget the eye.

217
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:37,380
<16-6,House>告诉他用另一只眼睛去寻找光明
<16-6,House>Tell him to use the other one to look on the bright side.

218
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,670
<16-6,House>血栓里面暗藏玄机
<16-6,House>The clot tells us something.

219
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:43,420
<16-6,House>能帮助我们解开谜团
<16-6,House>Could help us figure out what he has,

220
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,910
<16-6,House>或许他还有一线生机
<16-6,House>which could mean he gets to live.

221
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:48,220
<16-6,House>开始鉴别诊断  同志们
<16-6,House>Differential diagnosis, people.

222
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:51,050
<16-6,House>内出血病人怎么会突发血栓
<16-6,House>How does internal bleeding suddenly start clotting?

223
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:53,540
<16-7,Chase>这不可能  这是两个相反的过程
<16-7,Chase>It makes no sense. They're opposing processes.

224
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:55,210
<16-8,Cameron>红斑狼疮就有可能
<16-8,Cameron>It can happen in lupus.

225
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:57,400
<16-8,Cameron>血小板数量增多会导致血栓形成
<16-8,Cameron>Increased platelet count can cause blood clots.

226
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,730
<16-9,Wilson>抗核抗体检测呈阴性  不是红斑狼疮
<16-9,Wilson>A.N.A. was negative. It's not lupus.

227
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,210
<16-10,House>在理
<16-10,House>This is true.

228
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:03,100
<16-10,House>可是为什么会从你嘴里说出来
<16-10,House>But why are you the one saying it?

229
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:04,840
<16-10,House>你跑这儿干嘛
<16-10,House>What are you doing here?

230
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,230
<16-10,House>不是已经排除癌症了吗
<16-10,House>I thought we'd ruled out cancer.

231
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,240
<16-11,Wilson>一个人没意思
<16-11,Wilson>I was lonely.

232

<16-13,Wilson>真有意思  她也这么说你
<16-13,Wilson>That's funny. She said you might need one.

234
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:15,330
<16-14,House>原来是这么回事
<16-14,House>That's why you're here.

<16-14,House>她派你来监视我
<16-14,House>She wants you to keep an eye on me.

00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,680
<16-14,House>防止我作弊
<16-14,House>Make sure I don't cheat.

00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,150
<16-15,Wilson>不是  我是来看着你
<16-15,Wilson>No, I wanted to make sure

238
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:21,280
<16-15,Wilson>防止你乱开炮
<16-15,Wilson>you don't start firing shots from the clock tower.

239
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,790
<16-16,House>我没事

00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:34,950
<16-21,Foreman>这会有副作用
<16-21,Foreman>There's gonna be side effects.

<16-21,Foreman>失眠  抑郁  心动过速
<16-21,Foreman>Insomnia, depression, tachycardia.

247
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,260
<16-21,Foreman>对我唯一的副作用就是
<16-21,Foreman>The only side effects I'm gonna have

248
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,030
<16-22,House>一点疼痛和三十天的自由
<16-22,House>are some pain and 30 days of freedom.

249
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:48,470
<16-22,House>这里就我一个人关心那个将死的孩子吗
<16-22,House>Am I the only one who's concerned about a dying kid?

250
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:50,880
<16-22,House>如果不是红斑狼疮  那是什么
<16-22,House>If it's not lupus, what else?

251
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:53,490
<16-23,Chase>最有可能导致血栓的是
<16-23,Chase>Most likely candidate for throwing a clot

252
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:55,010
<16-23,Chase>感染和癌症
<16-23,Chase>is infection or cancer.

253
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:57,240
<16-24,Wilson>活检结果确定了两次  不是癌症
<16-24,Wilson>Checked the biopsy twice. It's not cancer.

254
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,020
<16-25,Foreman>不是感染  镓扫描没发现异常
<16-25,Foreman>It's not an infection. Gallium scan didn't reveal anything.

255
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:03,150
<16-26,House>好吧  哪里镓扫描无法覆盖
<16-26,House>Okay. What hides from a Gallium scan?

256
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,620
<16-27,Chase>心脏
<16-27,Chase>Cardiac.

257
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:11,060
<16-28,Cameron>没错  血栓脱落后通过动脉
<16-28,Cameron>Right. Clot flicks off, travels through the arteries,

258
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:12,670
<16-28,Cameron>到达眼部并滞留下来
<16-28,Cameron>then gets backed up in the eye.

259
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,620
<16-29,House>抱歉  我刚才走神了  说到哪里
<16-29,House>I'm sorry. I wasn't paying attention. What happened?

260
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,340
<16-30,Foreman>他的心脏上有感染
<16-30,Foreman>It's an infection in his heart.

<16-30,Foreman>太好了
<16-30,Foreman>Great.

262
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,360
<16-31,House>做超声心动图
<16-31,House>Echocardiogram for the heart

263
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,850
<16-31,House>立即静脉注射抗生素
<16-31,House>and I.V. antibiotics for the infection, stat.

264
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,250

<17-1,House>I'm not lonely. My leg hurts.

266
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,660
<17-2,Wilson>她是正经的按摩师
<17-2,Wilson>She's a real masseuse.

267

<17-3,House>她一小时要价至少500美金
<17-3,House>She's $500 an hour, minimum.

268
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,240
<17-4,Wilson>长的性感就一定是妓女吗
<17-4,Wilson>She's hot, so she's a hooker?

269
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,190
<17-4,Wilson>你这是哪门子的歪理
<17-4,Wilson>What kind of pathetic logic is that?

270
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,340
<17-4,Wilson>因为高中从来没爽过
<17-4,Wilson>The envious, jealous,

271
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:05,000
<17-5,House>导致妒火攻心的歪理  看不出来吗
<17-5,House>l-never-got-any-in-high-school kind of logic. Hello!

272
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:07,410

00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,410
<17-6,Wilson>天哪  她美呆了
<17-6,Wilson>God! She's beautiful.

275
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,410
<17-7,House>就因为她漂亮  我就该招呼她
<17-7,House>Because she's beautiful, I should do it?

276
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:16,140
<17-7,House>你又是哪门子的歪理
<17-7,House>What kind of pathetic logic is that?

277
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:19,960
<17-8,Wilson>身为有妇之夫围在城里导致妒火攻心的歪理
<17-8,Wilson>The envious, jealous, I'm-married-and-l-can't-do-anything logic.

278
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,590
<17-8,Wilson>你好
<17-8,Wilson>Hello.

279

280
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:24,740
<17-9,House>我相信你不管干什么都是一把好手  但
<17-9,House>I'm sure you're really good at whatever it is you do, but-

281
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,760
<17-10,Woman>-把手给我[西语]  -啥
<17-10,Woman>-Deme su mano. -Huh?

282
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,770
<17-11,House>嘿  别  放开我的手
<17-11,House>Hey, no, no. Let go of my hand.

283
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:30,920
<17-12,Wilson>-别这样  -她不懂英语
<17-12,Wilson>- Come on. - She doesn't speak English.

284
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:49,160
<17-13,Woman>老天爷
<17-13,Woman>Oh, my God.

285
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,630
<17-14,House>爽[西语]
<17-14,House>Bueno.

286
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:58,140
<17-15,Woman>脱掉衣服
<17-15,Woman>Take off your clothes.

287
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:03,510
<18-1,Chase>不喜欢吃沙拉酱肉吗
<18-1,Chase>Not a fan of the stroganoff?

288
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:09,120
<18-3,Chase>-我不饿  -抗生素可能引起反胃
<18-3,Chase>-I'm not hungry. -Well, the antibiotics can cause nausea.

289
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:11,180
<18-4,Keith>吃的也一样
<18-4,Keith>So can the food.

290
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,300
<18-4,Keith>你不是应该检查我的眼睛吗
<18-4,Keith>Shouldn't you be looking at my eye?

291
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:17,330
<18-5,Chase>这个血栓并不致命
<18-5,Chase>The blood clot isn't life-threatening.

292
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,930
<18-5,Chase>我们更关注你的根本病因
<18-5,Chase>We're focusing on figuring out the cause of your problems.

293
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:24,040
<18-6,Keith>也就是说我会永久失明  是吗
<18-6,Keith>So the- so the blindness will be permanent, won't it?

294
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:43,990
<19-1,House>-谢谢  -再见
<19-1,House>- Thank you. - Bye.

295
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:48,600
<19-3,House>我做了个按摩
<19-3,House>I had a massage.

296
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:52,100
<19-4,Chase>看起来像是你做了按摩师  消痛吗
<19-4,Chase>Looks like you had a masseuse. Help the pain?

297
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:54,600
<19-5,House>-我挺好的  -我知道
<19-5,House>- I'm fine. - I know.

298
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,100
<19-6,Chase>那孩子心超正常
<19-6,Chase>Kid's echo was normal.

299
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,940
<19-6,Chase>心脏瓣膜上无赘生物
<19-6,Chase>No signs of any vegetations on heart valves.

300
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:00,770
<19-7,House>你怎么说我都能驳倒的
<19-7,House>Never met a diagnostic study I couldn't refute.

301
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,780
<19-8,Chase>抗生素没有效果
<19-8,Chase>And the antibiotics aren't doing anything.

302
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:05,780
<19-9,House>剂量加倍  给到70毫克
<19-9,House>So double the dosage. 70 milligrams.

303
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:07,390
<19-10,Chase>那他的肾脏肯定要报销
<19-10,Chase>That'll box his kidneys for sure.

304
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:09,170
<19-11,House>你说的对  那就保住肾脏
<19-11,House>Oh, you're right. Save the kidney.

305
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,170
<19-11,House>接受移植的那个人肯定会感激不尽的
<19-11,House>The guy we transplant it into will be grateful.

306
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,020
<19-12,Chase>还有我有办法治疗他的眼睛
<19-12,Chase>Also, I have an idea for his eye.

307
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,170
<19-13,House>他的眼睛已经无可挽回了
<19-13,House>Nothing we can do about his eye.

308
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,610
<19-14,Chase>-他视网膜上有血栓  -别琢磨了
<19-14,Chase>- He's got a clot in the retina - Put it in a memo.

309
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,720
<19-15,House>如果我们从眼内
<19-15,House>If we remove some of the liquid

310
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,460
<19-16,Chase>抽出些玻璃状液
<19-16,Chase>from the eye itself, the vitreous humour,

311
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:24,110
<19-16,Chase>也许能在视网膜动脉周边腾出空间
<19-16,Chase>it might make some extra room around the retinal artery.

312
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:28,250
<19-17,House>如果动脉扩张  血栓或许能自行游离开
<19-17,House>If the artery expands, the clot might move on its own.

313
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,040
<19-17,House>挺有创意
<19-17,House>That's very creative.

314
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,920
<19-17,House>你原来怎么没提
<19-17,House>Why didn't you mention this before?

315
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,440
<19-18,Chase>先前没想到
<19-18,Chase>I didn't think of it before.

316
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,850
<19-18,Chase>你应该想到的
<19-18,Chase>You should've.

317
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,340
<20-1,Keith>肯定会疼
<20-1,Keith>This is going to hurt.

318
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,840
<20-2,Chase>你的眼部已经麻痹了  只会有点压迫感
<20-2,Chase>Your eye is numb. You'll only feel pressure.

319
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:30,500
<20-2,Chase>等一小会
<20-2,Chase>Give it a minute.

320
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,560
<20-3,Keith>我能看到了
<20-3,Keith>I can see.

321
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:09,900
<21-1,Keith>我能看到你了
<21-1,Keith>I can see you.

322
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:13,100
<21-2,Pam>我听说了  恭喜
<21-2,Pam>I heard. Congratulations.

323

<21-3,Keith>Don't. I haven't brushed my teeth in two days.

324
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,940
<21-4,Pam>我很害怕  怕他们查不出你的病因
<21-4,Pam>I'm so scared they're not gonna find out what's wrong with you.

325
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:28,810
<21-5,Keith>没什么大不了的  我很好
<21-5,Keith>No biggie. I'm fine.

326
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:32,950
<21-6,Pam>我感觉糟透了  都是我的错
<21-6,Pam>I feel so bad about all this. It's all my fault.

327
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:35,250
<21-7,Keith>不  不是这样的
<21-7,Keith>No. No, it's not.

328
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:39,280
<21-8,Pam>但你爸爸  他恨我
<21-8,Pam>But your father- he hates me.

329
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,960
<21-9,Keith>他只是因为车的事情生气
<21-9,Keith>He's just pissed about his car.

330
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:50,640
<21-10,Pam>救命  救命  救命
<21-10,Pam>Help! Help! Help!

331
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:02,410

332
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:04,620

<22-2,Cameron>A.S.T. is 859. We're getting him to the I.C.U.

333

<22-3,Chase>A.L.T. and G.G.T. are in the tank.

334
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,910
<22-4,House>-抗生素  -不可能是抗生素引起的
<22-4,House>- Our antibiotics - would not have caused this.

335
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:10,430
<22-5,Dad>她肯定给他毒品了
<22-5,Dad>She must have given him drugs!

336
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:13,790
<22-6,Pam>-我没有  -与毒品无关
<22-6,Pam>- I wouldn't do that! - It's not drugs!

<22-7,House>- His liver is shutting down. - What?

338
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,800
<22-8,Dad>那是什么意思
<22-8,Dad>What does that mean?

339
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,220
<22-9,House>说明他已经痊愈  可以回家了
<22-9,House>It means he's all better. He's ready to go home.

340
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,790
<22-10,Dad>-什么  -那你以为是什么意思
<22-10,Dad>- What? - What do you think it means?

341
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,660
<22-11,House>人没有肝就无法存活  他要死了
<22-11,House>You can't live without a liver. He's dying.

00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:38,200
<22-15,Cameron>他儿子生命垂危  你还讽刺他
<22-15,Cameron>His son's dying, and you're mocking him?

345
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:39,530
<22-16,House>他的问题太蠢了
<22-16,House>It was a dumb question.

346
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:42,130
<22-17,Cameron>不是这样
<22-17,Cameron>No, it wasn't.

347
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,470
<22-18,House>你说的对  那不蠢
<22-18,House>You're right. It wasn't.

348
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:50,330
<22-19,Cameron>证明卡迪错了就有这么重要吗
<22-19,Cameron>Is proving Cuddy wrong worth all this?

349
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:06,910
<23-1,Foreman>豪斯压根就不应该待在医院
<23-1,Foreman>You know, House shouldn't even be here.

350
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:09,340
<23-2,Chase>就因为他出言不逊
<23-2,Chase>Because he said something inappropriate?

351
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,490
<23-2,Chase>要是每次如此都要撵他回家
<23-2,Chase>If we sent him home every time he did that,

352
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:12,940
<23-2,Chase>那这个办公室早就关门大吉了
<23-2,Chase>we wouldn't need this office.

353
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,410
<23-3,Cameron>他很痛苦
<23-3,Cameron>He's in pain.

354
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:17,380
<23-4,Foreman>他要做到什么地步才能激怒你们
<23-4,Foreman>What does the man have to do to piss you off?

355
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:19,480
<23-5,Cameron>他已经70多小时没吃止痛片了
<23-5,Cameron>He's been without pain relief for over 70 hours.

356
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,320
<23-5,Cameron>说的就是这个
<23-5,Cameron>Exactly!

357
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:22,880
<23-6,Foreman>他在戒毒  你们看不出来他已经失去理智了吗
<23-6,Foreman>He's detoxing. Can't you see he's out of his mind?

358
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,950
<23-7,House>他们也是这么说曼森的[摇滚歌手]
<23-7,House>That's what they said about Manson.

359
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,210
<23-7,House>你们是想接着聊我的八卦
<23-7,House>Do you wanna continue talking about me,

360
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,750
<23-7,House>还是讨论肝衰竭表明的问题呢
<23-7,House>or should we discuss what the liver damage tells us?

361
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:36,690
<23-7,House>我出生在伊利诺伊的一个小木屋里
<23-7,House>I was born in a log cabin in Illinois-

362
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:39,020
<23-8,Cameron>溶血性贫血不会导致肝衰竭
<23-8,Cameron>Hemolytic anemia doesn't cause liver damage.

363
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,890
<23-8,Cameron>加上他在咯血
<23-8,Cameron>Add the fact he's coughing blood,

364
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,580
<23-8,Cameron>已经有三条线索表明这是红斑狼疮
<23-8,Cameron>you've got three of the indicators of organ-threatening lupus.

365
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,350
<23-9,House>红斑狼疮不会发展这么快
<23-9,House>It's moving too fast.

366
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:48,950
<23-9,House>可能是戊型肝炎
<23-9,House>Could be hepatitis "E."

367
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:51,730
<23-10,Foreman>至今只发现过一例源于美国的戊型肝炎
<23-10,Foreman>There's only been one case of hep "E" originating in the U.S.

368
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,900
<23-11,House>据记载
<23-11,House>Since his history says

369
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:56,270
<23-11,House>他去年曾四次出入境
<23-11,House>he's been in and out of the country four times in the last year.

370
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,700
<23-12,Cameron>你真的认为他得了戊型肝炎
<23-12,Cameron>You really think he's got hep "E"?

371
00:20:57,770 --> 00:21:00,370
<23-13,House>不是  我觉得红斑狼疮可能性更大些
<23-13,House>No. I think lupus is way more likely.

372
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,240
<23-14,Cameron>好  给他静脉注射环磷酰胺  去血浆
<23-14,Cameron>All right, then let's start him on I.V. Cytoxan and plasmapheresis.

373
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:05,600
<23-15,House>不对  应该首先排除戊型肝炎
<23-15,House>No, we should rule out hep "E."

374
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:07,710
<23-16,Foreman>你才说过不是戊型肝炎
<23-16,Foreman>You just said it wasn't hep "E."

375
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:09,030
<23-16,Foreman>我只是说红斑狼疮可能性更大些
<23-16,Foreman>I said lupus is way more likely,

376
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:10,130
<23-17,House>但如果他得的是戊型肝炎
<23-17,House>but if we treat for lupus

377
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:11,330
<23-17,House>而我们按红斑狼疮来治疗
<23-17,House>and it is hep "E"-

378
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:13,540
<23-18,Chase>-那他就完蛋了  -没错
<23-18,Chase>- He's toast. - Exactly.

379
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:15,550
<23-19,House>但戊型肝炎尚无有效的治疗方案
<23-19,House>But there isn't a treatment for hepatitis "E."

380
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:18,780
<23-20,Cameron>要么自行恢复  要么持续恶化
<23-20,Cameron>Either he'll get better on his own or he'll continue to deteriorate.

381
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:22,300
<23-21,House>是啊  我在医学院里也学过
<23-21,House>Yeah. I went to medical school too.

382
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,370
<23-21,House>使用甲强龙
<23-21,House>Start him on solumedrol.

383
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,560
<23-22,Cameron>如果是戊型肝炎  这么做只会恶化病情
<23-22,Cameron>If he's got hep "E," that's only gonna make him worse.

384
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:30,390
<23-23,House>少用点  要掌握火候  同志们
<23-23,House>Not as much. It's Goldilocks, people.

386
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:32,490
<23-23,House>不能做的太过  把他弄死
<23-23,House>Won't hurt him so much that it'll kill him,

387
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:34,910
<23-23,House>也不能小到没有效果
<23-23,House>and it won't hurt him so little that we can't tell.

388
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:37,160
<23-23,House>要刚刚好
<23-23,House>It'll hurt him... just right.

389
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:39,270
<23-23,House>如果不起作用
<23-23,House>And if it does nothing-

390
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:41,000
<23-24,Chase>我们就可以排除戊型肝炎
<23-24,Chase>we'll know it's not hep "E"

391
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,090
<23-24,Chase>而以狼疮来治疗
<23-24,Chase>and can start treating for lupus.

392
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:44,620
<23-25,House>那你们喝点水  看着我干吧
<23-25,House>Now watch me do it while drinking a glass of water.

393
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,340
<23-25,House>我们该跟他爸说什么
<23-25,House>What do we tell the dad?

394
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,230
<23-26,Foreman>"我们认为您的孩子有狼疮
<23-26,Foreman>"We think your kid has lupus,

395
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:49,530
<23-26,Foreman>所以当作戊型肝炎来治疗
<23-26,Foreman>so we're gonna treat him for hepatitis 'E'.

396
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:51,510
<23-26,Foreman>而如果他得的是戊型肝炎
<23-26,Foreman>And, oh, yeah, if it really is hep 'E,'

397
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,480
<23-26,Foreman>我们现在用的药又无法治愈他
<23-26,Foreman>we're not actually giving him hep 'E ' medication.

398
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:55,480
<23-26,Foreman>所以无论如何他的病情只会恶化  不会改善
<23-26,Foreman>So it's gonna make him worse, not better."

399
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,150
<23-27,House>你觉得他能接受这说法
<23-27,House>Think he'll go for that?

400
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:00,100
<23-28,Cameron>-你希望我们撒谎  -没有
<23-28,Cameron>- So you want us to lie? - No.

401
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,070
<23-29,House>-我想让你去骗他  -为什么是我
<23-29,House>- I want you to lie. - Why me?

402
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:05,130
<23-31,House>因为他信任你
<23-31,House>Because he trusts you.

403
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,760
<24-2,Foreman>-这是个错误  -会被起诉的
<24-2,Foreman>- This is a mistake. - This is a lawsuit.

404
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,690
<24-3,Chase>戊型肝炎只是一种可能
<24-3,Chase>Hep "E" is possible.

405
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,170
<24-3,Chase>豪斯总是耍这些花招
<24-3,Chase>House always pulls these stunts,

406
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:15,200
<24-3,Chase>而且通常都是对的
<24-3,Chase>and he's right more often-

407
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,610
<24-4,Foreman>他延迟治疗就因为那百万分之一的机会
<24-4,Foreman>He's delaying treatment because of a

408
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:19,060
<24-4,Foreman>即便他自己都否定
<24-4,Foreman>one-in-a-million chance that even he doesn't think is the problem.

409
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,070
<24-5,Cameron>-我不想骗他  -那就别骗
<24-5,Cameron>- I don't wanna lie to him. - Then don't.

410
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:22,640
<24-7,Cameron>然后被炒吗
<24-7,Cameron>And get fired?

411
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,750
<24-8,Chase>他才不会炒你  他爱死你了
<24-8,Chase>Oh, like he's gonna fire you. He loves you.

412
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:26,400
<24-9,Cameron>我得做点什么
<24-9,Cameron>I've gotta do something.

413
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,590
<24-9,Cameron>孩子需要治疗
<24-9,Cameron>Kid needs treatment.

414
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:29,410
<24-10,Foreman>当作狼疮来治
<24-10,Foreman>Treat him for lupus.

415
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:32,140
<24-11,Chase>这会让你被炒的
<24-11,Chase>That will get you fired.

416
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:35,130
<24-12,Cameron>你真的认为豪斯疯了
<24-12,Cameron>You really think House is losing it?

417
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:36,950
<24-13,Foreman>是啊
<24-13,Foreman>Yeah.

418
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:41,470
<24-14,Chase>他没疯  他知道自己在干什么
<24-14,Chase>He's fine. He knows what he's doing.

419
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,650
<24-14,Chase>好了
<24-14,Chase>Okay.

420
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:44,910
<25-1,Cameron>我们建议使用甲强龙
<25-1,Cameron>We're recommending a drug called solumedrol.

421
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:49,540
<25-2,Dad>治疗肝炎吗  血检显示是肝炎吗
<25-2,Dad>For hepatitis? Did that show up on his blood tests?

422
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:53,990
<25-3,Cameron>检查结果不会百分百准确
<25-3,Cameron>The tests are never 100% accurate.

423
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,490
<25-4,Dad>那其他检查结果也可能是错的
<25-4,Dad>Well, then all the other tests could be wrong too.

424
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:57,740
<25-4,Dad>他可能是感染或者癌症
<25-4,Dad>This could still be an infection or cancer.

425
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:02,800
<25-5,Cameron>他最近的症状与那些病不符
<25-5,Cameron>They don't fit any of the most recent symptoms.

426
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:05,660
<25-6,Dad>什么  只有肝炎符合吗
<25-6,Dad>Well, what, just hepatitis does?

427
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:09,400
<25-6,Dad>我知道  我知道你们永远不能确定
<25-6,Dad>I know, I know, I know- you can never be sure.

428
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:15,370
<25-6,Dad>以前温蒂住院的时候
<25-6,Dad>When Wendy was in the hospital,

429
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:19,650
<25-6,Dad>医生说有种激进的实验性疗法
<25-6,Dad>a doctor told us there was this aggressive experimental treatment...

430
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:23,120
<25-6,Dad>也许能让她多活两三年
<25-6,Dad>which might extend her life by two or three years.

431
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:26,130
<25-6,Dad>我们觉得  只要有一丝希望
<25-6,Dad>Well, we figured if there was any hope at all that

432
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:28,680
<25-6,Dad>让她多陪陪我们  都值得我们去尝试
<25-6,Dad>we could have her with us a little while longer, it'd be worth it.

433
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:32,320
<25-6,Dad>三周后  她就死了
<25-6,Dad>Three weeks later, she was gone.

434
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:37,760
<25-7,Cameron>我认为不是肝炎
<25-7,Cameron>I don't think it's hepatitis.

435
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,430
<25-7,Cameron>我认为你儿子得了狼疮
<25-7,Cameron>I think your son has lupus.

436
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,370
<26-1,Wilson>我认为你骨折了
<26-1,Wilson>I think it's broken.

437
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,430
<26-1,Wilson>你干什么了
<26-1,Wilson>What did you do?

438
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:52,380
<26-2,House>不小心把手夹车门里了
<26-2,House>Accidentally closed the car door on it.

439
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:54,900
<26-3,Wilson>不可能  车门会把皮肤蹭破的
<26-3,Wilson>No. Door would've broken the skin.

440
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:59,310
<26-3,Wilson>看起来像是被某样坚硬平整的东西砸断的
<26-3,Wilson>This looks like something hard and smooth smashed it.

441
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:01,320
<26-4,House>我要见我的律师
<26-4,House>I want my lawyer.

442
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:04,290
<26-5,Wilson>大脑对疼痛的耐受有一个阈值
<26-5,Wilson>The brain has a gating mechanism for pain.

443
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:06,410
<26-5,Wilson>会记录下最严重的疼痛信号
<26-5,Wilson>Registers the most severe injury

444
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:08,030
<26-5,Wilson>并阻止其他疼痛信号传入大脑
<26-5,Wilson>and blocks out the others.

445
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,770
<26-5,Wilson>它起作用了吗
<26-5,Wilson>Did it work?

446
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:11,440
<26-6,House>我的手疼得要死
<26-6,House>Well, my hand hurts like hell.

447
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:16,040
<26-6,House>是的  我感觉好多了
<26-6,House>Yeah. I feel much better.

448
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:19,050
<26-8,House>别给我上夹板
<26-8,House>Don't splint it.

449
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:21,330
<26-8,House>我希望下次需要止疼时
<26-8,House>I want to be able to bang it against the wall

450
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:23,550
<26-8,House>还能用这只手砸墙
<26-8,House>if I need to administer another dose.

451
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:26,320
<26-8,House>包扎一下就好
<26-8,House>Just tape it up.

452
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:33,540
<26-9,Cuddy>你为什么让卡梅隆骗福斯特先生
<26-9,Cuddy>Why did you tell Cameron to lie to Mr. Foster?

453
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,770
<26-10,House>-包紧点  -回答我
<26-10,House>- Make it tight. - Answer me.

454
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:40,060
<26-11,Cuddy>我说什么都改变不了你的看法
<26-11,Cuddy>Nothing I can say is gonna change how you feel,

455
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:41,950
<26-12,House>你的反应也都不会
<26-12,House>and nothing can come out of your reaction

456
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:44,100
<26-12,House>改变我的计划
<26-12,House>that is gonna change what I plan to do,

457
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,540
<26-12,House>所以我情愿什么都不说
<26-12,House>so I prefer to say nothing.

458
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:48,400
<26-13,Cuddy>这就是你所谓的"什么都不说吗"
<26-13,Cuddy>So that was just you saying nothing.

459
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,520
<26-14,House>-那人已经暴怒了  -还吓坏了
<26-14,House>- The guy is furious. - And scared.

460
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,450
<26-16,House>那你打算怎么办
<26-16,House>So what are you gonna do?

461
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:55,490
<26-17,Cuddy>他爸坚持当作狼疮来治疗
<26-17,Cuddy>The father's insisting on the lupus treatment.

462
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:58,030
<26-18,House>是的  卡梅隆跟我说过了
<26-18,House>Yeah, Cameron told me,

463
00:25:58,030 --> 00:25:59,200
<26-18,House>我让她转告他不行
<26-18,House>and I told her to tell him no.

464
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:02,910
<26-19,Cuddy>你不能袖手旁观  就让那孩子死去
<26-19,Cuddy>Well, you can't just sit back and let the kid die.

465
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:05,140
<26-20,House>-他爸也不行  -那你计划怎样
<26-20,House>- Neither can the father. -So that's your plan?

466
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:07,590
<26-21,Cuddy>你要拿那孩子的命当赌注吗
<26-21,Cuddy>You're gonna play chicken with the kid's life?

467
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:10,430
<26-22,House>那是他爸  我会赢得很轻松
<26-22,House>Well, he's the dad. I should win easily.

468
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,860
<26-23,Cuddy>休一礼拜假吧
<26-23,Cuddy>Take the week off.

469
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:15,370
<26-24,House>为什么  就因为我对病人撒谎了
<26-24,House>Why, 'cause I lied to a patient?

470
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,870
<26-24,House>我冒险  有时病人会因此死亡
<26-24,House>I take risks. Sometimes patients die.

471
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:20,870
<26-24,House>但我不冒险会让更多病人死亡
<26-24,House>But not taking risks causes more patients to die,

472
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,200
<26-24,House>所以我想我最大的问题是
<26-24,House>so I guess my biggest problem is

473
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:24,140
<26-24,House>一直为自己的计算能力所苦
<26-24,House>I've been cursed with the ability to do the math.

474
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:30,310
<26-25,Cameron>我告诉他我们不会作为狼疮治疗  直到
<26-25,Cameron>I told him that we wouldn't treat him for the lupus until-

475
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,650
<26-26,House>他说什么
<26-26,House>What'd he say?

476
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:33,980
<26-27,Cameron>他说他想让凯斯转院
<26-27,Cameron>He said he wanted to transfer Keith to another hospital.

477
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:36,160
<26-28,Cuddy>他情况不稳定  都撑不到出门
<26-28,Cuddy>He's not stable enough. He'd never make it through the door.

478
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,020
<26-29,Cameron>我就是这么说的
<26-29,Cameron>That's what I told him.

479
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:38,610
<26-30,House>那他妥协了吧
<26-30,House>And that's when he caved.

480
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:43,140
<26-31,Cameron>是啊  他同意了你的方案
<26-31,Cameron>Yeah. He agreed to do it your way.

481
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:45,130
<26-32,House>二加二等于四
<26-32,House>Two plus two equals four.

482
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:52,750
<27-1,Chase>肝功结果一小时内就会出来
<27-1,Chase>If it is hepatitis "E", we should see a marked decline

483
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,940
<27-1,Chase>如果真是戊肝  肝炎指数就会明显下降
<27-1,Chase>in liver function tests within the hour.

484
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:55,760
<27-2,Dad>干嘛要跟我解释这个
<27-2,Dad>Why bother explaining it to me?

485
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,510
<27-2,Dad>我别无选择
<27-2,Dad>It's not like I have any choice in the matter.

486
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,020
<27-3,Cameron>如果不是戊型肝炎
<27-3,Cameron>If there's no hep "E",

487
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,280
<27-3,Cameron>我们马上按照狼疮来治疗
<27-3,Cameron>we'll start treatment for lupus immediately.

488
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:04,340
<27-5,Chase>-凯斯  怎么了  -怎么了
<27-5,Chase>- Keith? What's wrong? - What's happening?

489
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,350
<27-7,Keith>别这样  走开
<27-7,Keith>No, get off.

490
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:08,790
<27-8,Chase>凯斯  我是奇斯医生  哪里疼
<27-8,Chase>Keith, it's Dr. Chase. Where does it hurt?

491
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:09,880
<27-9,Keith>朱尔斯  别这样
<27-9,Keith>Jules, no!

492
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,050
<27-11,Dad>-他产生幻觉了  -是药物作用
<27-11,Dad>- He's hallucinating. - Is this from the medicine?

493
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,680
<27-12,Chase>-我们还没开始用药  -凯斯
<27-12,Chase>- We haven't started the medicine. - Keith,

494
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,620
<27-13,Cameron>你在医院里  凯斯  你身上什么都没有
<27-13,Cameron>you're in the hospital. Keith, there's nothing on you.

495
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:19,060
<27-14,Dad>-凯斯  -凯斯  凯斯  凯斯
<27-14,Dad>- Hey. Hey. Keith. - Keith! Keith! Keith!

496
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:21,660
<27-14,Dad>你还好吧  孩子
<27-14,Dad>Hey. You okay, buddy?

497
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:30,130
<27-15,Keith>我想我尿床了
<27-15,Keith>Um, I think I wet the bed.

498
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:34,210
<27-16,Chase>别担心  没关系  我们把你扶起来
<27-16,Chase>Oh- Don't worry about it. It's fine. Let's get you up.

499
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:38,850
<27-18,Cameron>-天啊  -他大出血了
<27-18,Cameron>- Oh, God.! - He's had a major bleed.

500
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,530
<27-18,Cameron>鲜红色的  是直肠出血
<27-18,Cameron>Bright red blood per rectum.

501
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:42,690
<27-19,Keith>我不是故意的  对不起
<27-19,Keith>I didn't- I didn't mean to. I'm sorry.

502
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,730
<27-20,Chase>他失血性休克了
<27-20,Chase>He's going into hypovolemic shock.

503
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:46,920
<27-20,Chase>血压60  心率140
<27-20,Chase>Pressure's 60, heart rate's 140.

504
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,850
<27-21,Cameron>立刻进行血管造影术
<27-21,Cameron>We need an angiography, stat!

505
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:01,540
<28-1,Foreman>血管造影提示胃肠道大出血
<28-1,Foreman>Angiography revealed major upper and lower G.I. Bleeding,

506
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:04,380
<28-1,Foreman>严重血液动力学障碍和肝功能衰竭
<28-1,Foreman>severe hemodynamic compromise and liver failure.

507
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:06,270
<28-2,Chase>他还产生幻觉
<28-2,Chase>He's also hallucinating.

508
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:08,630
<28-2,Chase>认为自己在被一个名叫朱尔斯的人折磨着
<28-2,Chase>Thinks he's being tortured by someone named Jules.

509
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:10,640
<28-3,Cameron>幻觉是精神病的症状之一
<28-3,Cameron>Hallucinations are a symptom of psychosis,

510
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:12,670
<28-3,Cameron>这是第四个诊断指标
<28-3,Cameron>which is the fourth diagnostic criterion.

511
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:15,150
<28-3,Cameron>可以确诊为狼疮了
<28-3,Cameron>It's official. This is lupus.

512
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:18,150
<28-3,Cameron>谁是朱尔斯
<28-3,Cameron>Who's Jules?

513
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,780
<28-4,House>病史里有提过她吗
<28-4,House>Any mention of her in the medical history?

514
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,790
<28-5,Cameron>他幻想什么并不重要
<28-5,Cameron>It doesn't matter what he's hallucinating about,

515
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:24,080
<28-5,Cameron>重要的是产生幻觉的原因  这是狼疮
<28-5,Cameron>it matters why. It's lupus.

516
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,090
<28-6,House>没必要发火嘛
<28-6,House>Well, there's no need to get snippy.

517
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,720
<28-6,House>这种狼疮需要很多年才会发展到这步
<28-6,House>This kind of lupus takes years to get to this point.

518
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,190
<28-6,House>-他才发病一礼拜  -是啊
<28-6,House>- It's been a week. - Yeah.

519
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:32,330
<28-7,Cameron>16岁的孩子不应患有溶血性贫血
<28-7,Cameron>And a 16-year-old kid shouldn't have hemolytic anemia

520
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:34,390
<28-7,Cameron>或者七窍流血  但他有
<28-7,Cameron>or be bleeding out of every orifice, but he is.

521
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:36,340
<28-7,Cameron>我们本来有机会治疗的
<28-7,Cameron>We had an opportunity to treat this.

522
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,380
<28-7,Cameron>却一直绕着戊型肝炎转
<28-7,Cameron>Instead, we diddled around with hepatitis "E"

523
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:39,400
<28-7,Cameron>现在治也晚了
<28-7,Cameron>and now it's too late.

524
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:42,240
<29-6,Cameron>他需要换肝  我们搞砸了
<29-6,Cameron>He needs a new liver. We screwed up.

525
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:45,210
<28-8,House>你是说我搞砸了
<28-8,House>You're saying I screwed up.

526
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:49,380
<28-10,House>-是的  -那你干嘛不直接说出来
<28-10,House>- Yes. - Then why don't you just say that?

527
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:51,910
<28-11,Foreman>你这是在责怪她吗
<28-11,Foreman>You gonna blame this on her?

528
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:54,580
<28-12,House>你同意当做戊型肝炎治疗的建议吗
<28-12,House>Did you agree with my recommendation to treat for hep "E"?

529
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:57,370
<28-14,Chase>-我不同意  -她已经说得很清楚了
<28-14,Chase>- No, I didn't. - And she made herself quite clear.

530
00:28:57,370 --> 00:28:59,170
<28-15,House>那她还对那个父亲撒谎
<28-15,House>And then she went and lied to the father.

531
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:00,330
<28-15,House>这才是你们生气的原因
<28-15,House>That's why you're angry.

532
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:01,140
<28-16,Cameron>我那是信任你
<28-16,Cameron>Yeah. I trusted you.

533
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:04,770
<28-17,House>你总是信任我  这就大错特错了
<28-17,House>You always trust me. That's a big mistake.

534
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,150
<28-17,House>狼疮的诊断是错的
<28-17,House>Lupus is a bad diagnosis.

535
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:08,600
<28-18,Chase>这是目前最合理的诊断了
<28-18,Chase>It's the best diagnosis we've got.

536
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,210
<28-19,House>但并不意味它就是对的
<28-19,House>That doesn't make it good.

537
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:13,050
<28-20,Foreman>没错  但这给了孩子唯一的生存机会
<28-20,Foreman>No. It just makes it this kid's only chance to live.

538
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,120
<28-20,Foreman>把他列入移植等待名单
<28-20,Foreman>Put him on the transplant list.

539
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:22,390
<28-21,House>确保卡迪知道此事
<28-21,House>And make sure Cuddy knows.

540
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:26,480
<28-21,House>看她能不能把这孩子的名字提到前面
<28-21,House>See if she can do anything to get him close to the top.

541
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:51,940
<28-21,House>在食堂吃的
<28-21,House>Cafeteria.

542
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:53,950
<28-21,House>千万别吃那寿司
<28-21,House>Stay away from the sushi.

543
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:56,040
<28-22,Foreman>你的手怎么了
<28-22,Foreman>And what happened to your hand?

544
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:59,420
<28-23,House>被抽屉夹着了
<28-23,House>Got stuck in a drawer.

545
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,990
<28-24,Foreman>好吧  你在戒毒
<28-24,Foreman>Yeah, right. You're going through withdrawal.

546
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:05,760
<28-25,House>不是  我是疼的
<28-25,House>No, I am going through pain.

547
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,770
<28-25,House>疼痛引起呕吐
<28-25,House>Pain causes nausea.

548
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,780
<28-26,Foreman>我来这里是跟你一起工作的
<28-26,Foreman>I took this job to work with you,

549
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:12,930
<28-26,Foreman>不是替你收拾烂摊子的
<28-26,Foreman>not cover your ass.

550
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,900
<28-26,Foreman>你的维柯丁
<28-26,Foreman>Your Vicodin.

551
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:22,530
<28-27,House>你的解决办法就是把药给我
<28-27,House>And your solution is to give me drugs.

552
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,540
<28-27,House>-真有意思  -不是
<28-27,House>- That's interesting. - No.

553
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,940
<28-28,Foreman>我是在收拾自己的烂摊子
<28-28,Foreman>Now I'm covering my ass.

554
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:30,640
<28-28,Foreman>趁你还没杀死那孩子前把药吃了
<28-28,Foreman>Take your pills before you kill this kid.

555
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,920
<29-1,Cameron>狼疮通常使用药物治疗
<29-1,Cameron>Lupus is normally treated with medication.

556
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:15,650
<29-1,Cameron>但凯斯的病情恶化太快
<29-1,Cameron>But in Keith's case, the disease is too advanced.

557
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,180
<29-2,Dad>因为你撒谎
<29-2,Dad>Because you lied.

558
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:20,500
<29-2,Dad>因为豪斯把我儿子的命当儿戏
<29-2,Dad>Because House wanted to play games with my son's life.

559
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,750
<29-3,Chase>没法确定
<29-3,Chase>There's no way to really tell what

560
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:23,250
<29-3,Chase>病情发展到哪步了
<29-3,Chase>progression the disease may have taken.

561
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:23,700
<29-3,Chase>你说的没错
<29-3,Chase>You're right.

562
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:28,370
<29-4,Cameron>对不起
<29-4,Cameron>And I'm sorry.

563
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:32,280
<29-5,Dad>那我们该怎么办
<29-5,Dad>So what do we do?

564
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:34,280
<29-6,Cameron>他需要一个新的肝脏
<29-6,Cameron>He needs a new liver.

565
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:38,790
<30-1,Cuddy>移植等待名单上有一万五千人
<30-1,Cuddy>There are over 15,000 patients on the transplant list.

566
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:41,720
<30-2,Foreman>那有多少人得不到新的肝脏会失血而亡
<30-2,Foreman>But how many are about to bleed to death unless they get a new liver?

567
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:44,260
<30-3,Cuddy>在新泽西  大概有20个吧
<30-3,Cuddy>In Jersey? I'd say, uh, 20.

568
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:46,760
<30-3,Cuddy>就因为找不到供体肝脏
<30-3,Cuddy>Two thousand patients die each year

569
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,120
<30-3,Cuddy>每年有两千个病人死去
<30-3,Cuddy>because a donor liver can't be found.

570
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:48,920
<30-3,Cuddy>差不多是每天五个
<30-3,Cuddy>That's almost five a day.

571
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,690
<30-4,Foreman>这么说  他完蛋了
<30-4,Foreman>So he's screwed.

572
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:53,910
<30-5,Cuddy>我想想办法看吧
<30-5,Cuddy>I'll see what I can do.

573
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:57,090
<30-6,Dad>我能把自己的肝捐一部分吗
<30-6,Dad>Could I donate part of my liver?

574
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:59,010
<30-7,Chase>对不起  你们血型不匹配
<30-7,Chase>Sorry. You're a different blood type.

575
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:02,100
<30-8,Dad>-那我们只能等  -恐怕是的
<30-8,Dad>- So we just wait? - I'm afraid so.

576
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,430
<30-10,Dad>并且期待着某人死掉
<30-10,Dad>And hope for someone to die.

577
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,760
<30-11,House>谁是朱尔斯
<30-11,House>Who's Jules?

578
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:12,860
<30-12,Cameron>豪斯医生  你应该回你的办公室去
<30-12,Cameron>Dr. House, you should get back to your office

579
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:13,330
<30-13,House>朱尔斯
<30-13,House>Jules.

580
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:16,770
<30-13,House>-历史上没有这个人  -那是个幻觉
<30-13,House>- There's no Jules in the history. - It was a hallucination.

581
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,110
<30-15,House>-什么的幻觉  -是我家的猫
<30-15,House>- Of what?  - Our cat.

582
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:19,860
<30-16,Dad>-这有关系吗  -没有  抱歉
<30-16,Dad>- Does this matter?  - No. I'm sorry.

583
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,450
<30-17,Foreman>我们会一边继续输血
<30-17,Foreman>We'll continue the transfusions

584
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:23,560
<30-17,Foreman>并继续治疗贫血和肝衰竭
<30-17,Foreman>and the treatment for the anemia and liver failure

585
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:24,800
<30-17,Foreman>一边等待捐献者
<30-17,Foreman>while we're waiting for a donor.

586
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,920
<30-18,Dad>-我们还有多少时间  -没多少了
<30-18,Dad>- How long can he wait?  - Not long.

587
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,680
<30-20,House>我觉得这不是狼疮
<30-20,House>I don't think this is lupus.

588
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,150
<30-21,Cameron>这就是狼疮  来吧  我们回...
<30-21,Cameron>It's lupus. Come on, let's just go-

589
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:34,590
<30-22,House>你判定是狼疮的第四个依据是精神紊乱
<30-22,House>Your fourth diagnostic criterion for lupus is psychosis.

590
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:36,330
<30-22,House>这只是个想念自家小猫的孩子
<30-22,House>This is just a kid missing his cat.

591
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:38,460
<30-23,Chase>他被根本不存在的动物攻击了
<30-23,Chase>He was being attacked by an animal that wasn't in the room.

592
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:40,120
<30-23,Chase>这就是精神紊乱
<30-23,Chase>That's psychosis.

593
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,730
<30-24,House>精神紊乱和幻觉有本质的不同
<30-24,House>There's a difference between psychosis and hallucination.

594
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:44,880
<30-25,Foreman>所以如果他见到一只虚幻的猫  那就是狼疮
<30-25,Foreman>So if he was imagining a fake cat, it'd be lupus,

595
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,180
<30-25,Foreman>如果是真的猫  那就不是
<30-25,Foreman>but since it was a real cat, it's not?

596
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:48,400
<30-26,House>-嗑你的药去吧  -精神紊乱需要
<30-26,House>- Take your damn pills. - Psychosis requires-

597
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,710
<30-27,Dad>压根就没有猫
<30-27,Dad>There is no cat.

598
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,020
<30-27,Dad>朱尔斯死了
<30-27,Dad>Jules is dead.

599
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:59,550
<30-28,House>你家宠物死了  却从来没提起过
<30-28,House>You have a dead family pet and you never mentioned it?

600
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:01,880
<30-28,House>家族史很复杂啊
<30-28,House>Nice family history.

601
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,980
<30-29,Cameron>家族史是关于家庭成员的
<30-29,Cameron>Family history's asking about family members,

602
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,950
<30-29,Cameron>是"人"才有用
<30-29,Cameron>meaning people related to the patient.

603
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:07,300
<30-30,House>那猫是怎么死的
<30-30,House>How did the cat die?

604
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,380
<30-31,Dad>你们能让他滚吗
<30-31,Dad>Can you get him outta here?

605
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:10,310
<30-32,Cameron>豪斯  来吧  我们...
<30-32,Cameron>Dr. House, come on, let's-

606
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:11,500
<30-33,House>那猫到底怎么了
<30-33,House>What happened to the cat?

607
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,730
<30-34,Pam>老死了
<30-34,Pam>Old age.

608
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:17,310
<30-34,Pam>-她死的时候都15岁了  -什么时候
<30-34,Pam>- She was 15 years old.  - When?

609
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:19,140
<30-36,Pam>一个月前
<30-36,Pam>About a month ago.

610
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:21,250
<30-37,Dad>-这和病情有什么关系  -她睡在哪
<30-37,Dad>- Does this have anything to do with- - Where'd she sleep?

611
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:23,510
<30-38,House>-和凯斯在一起  -这不是猫过敏症
<30-38,House>- With Keith. - This is not a cat allergy.

612
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:24,720
<30-40,Cameron>也不是狼疮
<30-40,Cameron>And it's not lupus.

613
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:28,320
<30-41,House>朱尔斯现在在哪
<30-41,House>Where is Jules?

614
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:34,260
<31-1,Foreman>我读了4年的大学
<31-1,Foreman>Four years of college,

615
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:36,260
<31-1,Foreman>4年的医学院
<31-1,Foreman>four at med school,

616
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:38,260

<31-1,Foreman>two years of residency,

617
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:42,290
<31-1,Foreman>还经历了4年的专科医师训练  结果呢
<31-1,Foreman>another four of subspecialty training, and where do I end up?

618
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,900
<31-2,Chase>在一旁光说不练
<31-2,Chase>Talking instead of digging.

619
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,240
<31-2,Chase>来吧  地都冻住了
<31-2,Chase>Come on. The ground's frozen solid.

620
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:00,560
<31-2,Chase>那是什么
<31-2,Chase>What's that?

621
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,490
<31-2,Chase>让开路
<31-2,Chase>Out of the way!

622
00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:56,400
<32-1,Cuddy>我们拿到肝脏了  4号手术室准备
<32-1,Cuddy>We have the liver. Prep O.R. Four.

623
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:26,090
<32-1,Cuddy>好了  凯斯  从10开始倒数
<32-1,Cuddy>All right, Keith, start counting backward from ten.

624
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,150
<33-1,Anesthesiologist>10
<33-1,Anesthesiologist>Ten,

627
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:37,210
<33-2,Keith>手术刀
<33-2,Keith>Scalpel.

628
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:44,750
<33-3,House>停止麻醉
<33-3,House>Stop the gases.

629
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:46,290
<33-4,Hourani>你他妈在干什么  豪斯
<33-4,Hourani>What the hell are you doing, House?

630
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,990
<33-5,House>把一个16岁的孩子从终生的免疫抑制剂
<33-5,House>Saving a 16-year-old kid from a lifetime of immunosuppressant drugs

631
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:51,630
<33-5,House>和无法修复的手术伤疤中解救出来
<33-5,House>and a very nasty scar.

632
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,670
<33-5,House>这孩子不是狼疮性肝炎
<33-5,House>This kid doesn't have lupoid hepatitis.

633
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:55,660
<33-5,House>他是急性樟脑中毒
<33-5,House>He has acute naphthalene toxicity.

634
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:58,940
<33-6,Hourani>樟脑  你是说卫生球
<33-6,Hourani>Naphthalene? Y-Y-You're talking about mothballs.

635
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:00,740
<33-7,House>不  是白蚁
<33-7,House>Nope. Termites.

636
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:03,850
<33-7,House>他们制造樟脑来保护巢穴
<33-7,House>They create naphthalene to protect their nests,

637
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:06,040
<33-7,House>我猜他家的
<33-7,House>which I'm assuming is rather large

638
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:08,390
<33-7,House>白蚁已经成灾了
<33-7,House>and inside all four walls of his bedroom at home.

639
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,960
<33-8,Hourani>你有什么依据
<33-8,Hourani>And your assumption is based on what?

640
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,650
<33-9,House>我刚刚解剖了他家的猫
<33-9,House>The autopsy I just conducted on his pet cat.

641
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:17,950
<33-10,Hourani>通知卡迪  还有保安
<33-10,Hourani>Call Cuddy. And Security.

642
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:19,750
<33-11,House>你不能给他做肝脏移植
<33-11,House>You are not removing that kid's liver.

643
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:20,920
<33-11,House>快去
<33-11,House>Now!

644
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:28,260
<33-12,Hourani>你疯了吗
<33-12,Hourani>Have you completely lost your mind?

645
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:30,990
<33-13,House>我只是有点不舒服
<33-13,House>No, but I have been feeling a little sick lately.

646
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:37,090
<33-14,Anesthesiologist>现在做不了手术了
<33-14,Anesthesiologist>There's no way we can do this surgery now.

647
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:38,950
<33-14,Anesthesiologist>还用你说
<33-14,Anesthesiologist>Ya think?

648
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:41,920
<34-1,Foreman>你已经让他肝衰竭了  别再害死他
<34-1,Foreman>You've already cost him his liver. Don't kill him too.

649
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:44,330
<34-2,House>你就这么想给一个健康的孩子动手术啊
<34-2,House>Why are you so eager to cut into a healthy kid?

650
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:45,940
<34-3,Chase>健康  他都病入膏肓了
<34-3,Chase>Healthy? He's in the toilet.

651
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:48,020
<34-4,House>他只是需要喝点鸡汤
<34-4,House>He just needs some chicken soup.

652
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,710
<34-5,Chase>我去通知哈拉尼重新准备手术
<34-5,Chase>I'm telling Hourani to re-scrub.

653
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:51,980
<34-5,Chase>-我们必须得进行移植手术  -不行
<34-5,Chase>- We're doing this transplant.  - No, you're not.

654
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:54,970
<34-7,Chase>你说了  如果凯斯的症状是环境因素造成的
<34-7,Chase>You said it. If Keith's symptoms had an environmental cause,

655
00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:56,620
<34-7,Chase>那他到这的时候就应该消失了
<34-7,Chase>they would have disappeared as soon as he got here.

656
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:57,760
<34-8,Cameron>病情却越来越重
<34-8,Cameron>They've only gotten worse.

657
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,240
<34-9,House>如果这儿的饭菜比雷克岛监狱好那么丁点
<34-9,House>If the food here wasn't one step below Riker's Island,

659
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,290
<34-9,House>他的情况就会好点
<34-9,House>he would've gotten better.

660
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,560
<34-9,House>-他减重了14磅  -当然
<34-9,House>- He's lost 14 pounds-  - Sure.

661
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,990
<34-10,Foreman>原来都是饮食的问题
<34-10,Foreman>This is nothing but a dietary thing.

662
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:07,420
<34-11,House>樟脑是脂溶性气体
<34-11,House>Naphthalene is a gas, a fat-soluble gas.

663
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:09,700
<34-11,House>病人吸入气体  就在他的脂肪细胞中囤积下来
<34-11,House>Kid breathes it in, it gets stored in his fat cells.

664
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:10,820
<34-11,House>没进医院时
<34-11,House>Outside the hospital,

665
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:13,070
<34-11,House>他的身体依靠消耗蛋白质和碳水化合物提供能量
<34-11,House>his body burned protein and carbs for energy.

666
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,900
<34-11,House>但是樟脑留在脂肪细胞中
<34-11,House>And the naphthalene stayed in fat.

667
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:16,750
<34-11,House>但是车祸后
<34-11,House>But once the car accident put

668
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:19,740
<34-11,House>他住院并开始减重
<34-11,House>him in the hospital and he started losing weight,

669
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:22,110
<34-11,House>他的身体只能从别处获得能量
<34-11,House>his body had to get its energy somewhere else.

670
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:24,780
<34-11,House>于是开始燃烧脂肪
<34-11,House>It started to burn fat.

671
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:25,790
<34-11,House>闸门打开了
<34-11,House>The floodgates opened.

672
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:28,910
<34-11,House>毒气进入他的循环系统
<34-11,House>The poison poured into his system.

673
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:31,420
<34-12,Foreman>那你是说离开毒源反而害了他吗
<34-12,Foreman>So getting away from the poison is what poisoned him?

674
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:34,430
<34-13,House>不让他吃他爸做的肉馅饼才害了他
<34-13,House>Getting away from his dad's meat loaf is what's killing him.

675
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:37,160
<34-14,Cuddy>你准备好给我解释阻止手术的原因了吗
<34-14,Cuddy>You wanna explain to me why you stopped the surgery?

676
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:39,220
<34-14,Cuddy>我的天呐
<34-14,Cuddy>Oh, my God! My God.

677
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,730
<34-15,Dad>-我要告你  -嘿
<34-15,Dad>- I want him locked up! - Hey.!

678
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:45,900
<34-16,Chase>不要激动
<34-16,Chase>Take it easy.

679
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:59,610
<34-17,House>你家的猫不是老死的
<34-17,House>Your cat did not die of old age.

680
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:05,740
<34-17,House>它是死于樟脑中毒引发的
<34-17,House>It died of massive internal bleeding and acute liver failure...

681
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:07,910

<34-17,House>The exact same thing your son has.

683
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,890
<34-18,Dad>你对我撒谎  你搅黄我儿子的手术
<34-18,Dad>You lie to me, you mess up my son's surgery,

684
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:15,490
<34-18,Dad>现在你还指望我会相信你吗
<34-18,Dad>and now you expect me to trust you?

00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,030
<34-19,House>给我24个小时
<34-19,House>Give me 24 hours.

<34-19,House>我们给你儿子足够的卡路里
<34-19,House>We'll pump your son full of calories-

<34-20,Cuddy>那个肝脏已经给别人了
<34-20,Cuddy>That liver is going to somebody right now.

688
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:22,160
<34-21,Dad>我们要做手术
<34-21,Dad>We're doing that surgery.

689
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:27,340
<34-22,House>你要做了  就等于杀了四个孩子的母亲
<34-22,House>You do the surgery, you'll be killing a mother of four.

690
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:29,300
<34-23,Cuddy>三个孩子的父亲
<34-23,Cuddy>Father of three.

00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,060
<34-25,Dad>-我猜的  -现在也是吗
<34-25,Dad>- I was guessing. - Like you are now?

692
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:34,310
<34-26,House>樟脑中毒是我们
<34-26,House>Naphthalene poisoning is the best explanation

693
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:36,910
<34-26,House>能做出的最合理的诊断
<34-26,House>we have for what's wrong with your son.

694
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:39,320
<34-26,House>它能解释内出血
<34-26,House>It explains the internal bleeding,

695

<34-26,House>溶血性贫血和肝衰竭的原因
<34-26,House>the hemolytic anemia, the liver failure.

696
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:43,230
<34-26,House>下面的故事也就可想而知了
<34-26,House>It also predicts what'll happen next.

697
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,390
<34-22,House>如果你执意做手术
<34-22,House>If you do the surgery,

698
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:47,420
<34-26,House>他要被扔在手术台上14个小时
<34-26,House>he's gonna lay on that table for 14 hours...

699
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:48,930
<34-26,House>继而消耗更多的脂肪
<34-26,House>while his body continues to

700
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:51,260
<34-26,House>排放出更多的毒素
<34-26,House>burn fat and release poison into his system.

701

<34-26,House>不管怎样  我帮你个忙
<34-26,House>Either way, I did you a favor.

702
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:57,380
<34-26,House>他现在醒了  去和他临终道别吧
<34-26,House>He's awake now. You've got a chance to say good-bye.

703
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,520
<34-27,Cameron>我认为你应该相信豪斯医生
<34-27,Cameron>I think you should trust Dr. House.

704
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:23,070
<34-28,Dad>把肝脏让给别人
<34-28,Dad>Give the liver to the other guy.

705
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:39,460
<34-28,Dad>小心
<34-28,Dad>Watch out.

706
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:04,280
<35-1,Cameron>凝血酶比值下降  红细胞数量上升
<35-1,Cameron>I.N.R.'s down and his red count is climbing.

707
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:09,240
<35-1,Cameron>你的决定是对的
<35-1,Cameron>Means you made the right call.

708
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:12,020
<35-1,Cameron>他的肝功能在恢复  他没事了
<35-1,Cameron>His liver is healing. He's gonna be just fine.

709
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:30,410
<36-1,Wilson>你坚持了一周
<36-1,Wilson>You made it a week.

<36-4,House>-祝贺你  -卡迪是个笨蛋
<36-4,House>- Congratulations. - Cuddy's a sucker.

712
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:37,420
<36-4,House>其实只要两周不出门诊就行
<36-4,House>I would've done it for two weeks off.

713
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:39,000
<36-5,Wilson>是啊  小菜一碟
<36-5,Wilson>Yeah, it was a piece of cake.

<36-5,Wilson>有

716
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,160
<36-6,House>我是个瘾君子

717
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:00,810
<36-7,Wilson>好吧
<36-7,Wilson>Okay.

00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,370
<36-8,House>我不会戒药的

719
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:07,820
<36-9,Wilson>有不少戒药项目
<36-9,Wilson>There are programs.

720
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:09,820
<36-9,Wilson>卡迪会给你时间
<36-9,Wilson>Cuddy would give you the time.

721
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:12,430
<36-9,Wilson>你能找到新方法来抑制疼痛
<36-9,Wilson>You could get on a different pain management regimen.

722
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:13,360
<36-10,House>我不需要戒药
<36-10,House>I don't need to stop.

723
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:16,300
<36-11,Wilson>你刚说
<36-11,Wilson>You just said-

724
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:20,420
<36-12,House>我说我是个瘾君子  可没说这是问题
<36-12,House>I said I was an addict. I didn't say I had a problem.

725
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:23,470
<36-12,House>我花钱买药  自己做饭  我能工作
<36-12,House>I pay my bills. I make my meals. I function.

726
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:28,510
<36-13,Wilson>这就是你想要的  你都没什么朋友
<36-13,Wilson>Is that all you want? You have no relationships.

727
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:30,140
<36-14,House>我不想要朋友
<36-14,House>I don't want any relationships.

728
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:31,330
<36-15,Wilson>你故意疏远别人
<36-15,Wilson>You alienate people.

729
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:33,650
<36-16,House>从三岁开始我就这样了
<36-16,House>I've been alienating people since I was three.

730
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:36,150
<36-17,Wilson>行了  别这样
<36-17,Wilson>Oh, come on! Drop it.

731
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:39,210
<36-17,Wilson>你不觉得你已经变了吗
<36-17,Wilson>You don't think you've changed in the last few years?

732
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:40,270
<36-18,House>当然
<36-18,House>Well, of course I have.

733
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:42,440
<36-18,House>我老了  头发稀疏了
<36-18,House>I've- I've gotten older, my hair's got thinner.

734
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:44,580
<36-18,House>有时我觉得无聊  有时我觉得孤独
<36-18,House>Sometimes I'm bored. Sometimes I'm lonely.

735
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:45,970
<36-18,House>有时我质疑活着的价值
<36-18,House>Sometimes I wonder what it all means.

736
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:47,150
<36-19,Wilson>不  我见证了一切
<36-19,Wilson>No, I was there.

737
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:50,240
<36-19,Wilson>你不只是变老了那么简单
<36-19,Wilson>You are not just a regular guy who's getting older.

738
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:53,870
<36-19,Wilson>你变了  你痛苦异常  不敢面对自己
<36-19,Wilson>You've changed. You're miserable, and you're afraid to face yourself.

739
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:55,920
<36-20,House>我当然变了
<36-20,House>Of course I've changed!

740
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,520
<36-21,Wilson>都是因为腿吗
<36-21,Wilson>And everything's the leg?

741
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:08,590
<36-21,Wilson>和药没有关系吗  他们对你毫无作用吗
<36-21,Wilson>Nothing's the pills? They haven't done a thing to you?

742
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:13,100
<36-22,House>他们让我静心工作
<36-22,House>They let me do my job.

743
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:15,800
<36-22,House>让我远离疼痛
<36-22,House>And they take away my pain.

744
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:49,710
<37-1,Cuddy>谈得怎么样
<37-1,Cuddy>How'd it go?

745
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:52,210
<37-2,Wilson>他承认他对麻醉剂上瘾
<37-2,Wilson>He admitted he's addicted to the narcotics.

746
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,780
<37-3,Cuddy>向你承认只是
<37-3,Cuddy>Well, admitting you have a problem

747
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,770
<37-4,Wilson>-第一步  -他说这不是问题
<37-4,Wilson>- is the first  - And he says it's not a problem.

748
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,050
<37-4,Wilson>也许真不是问题
<37-4,Wilson>Maybe it's not.

749
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,050
<37-4,Wilson>我不知道
<37-4,Wilson>What do I know?

750
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,750
<37-5,Cuddy>你打算怎么办
<37-5,Cuddy>What are you gonna do?

751
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:04,390
<37-6,Wilson>什么都不干  够焦头烂额的了
<37-6,Wilson>Nothing. Done enough damage.

752
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:06,430
<37-7,Cuddy>最好别让他知道这是你的主意
<37-7,Cuddy>Better hope he never finds out that that was your idea.

753
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:08,390
<37-8,Wilson>他不会信的
<37-8,Wilson>He'd never believe it.
