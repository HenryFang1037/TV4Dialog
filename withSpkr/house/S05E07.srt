<2-14,Cameron>他答应见我们
<2-14,Cameron>He agreed to meet with us.

<2-19,House>我们进化出来尴尬这种感觉是有原因的
<2-19,House>There's a reason that we'veabcevolved a feeling of awkwardness.

49
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:16,650
<2-19,House>这样就知道不该谈某些事
<2-19,House>It tells us not to talk about things.

50
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,190
<2-20,Cuddy>我当时因为领养不成而失落

56
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:40,070
<2-22,Cameron>便携仪器无法辨别出血点或肿瘤abc也无法看到血管炎
<2-22,Cameron>Portable equipment can't distinguish aabcbleed or a tumor. Can't see vasculitis.

57
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,470
<2-23,Thirteen>Cuddy想干嘛?
<2-23,Thirteen>What did cuddy want?

00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,770
<2-28,Kutner>辉指的是"光辉"...
<2-28,Kutner>Pyro means "fire"...

64
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,570
<2-29,Cameron>他们都是指引矿石
<2-29,Cameron>they're indicator minerals.

65
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:03,100
<2-29,Cameron>你是看不到钻石的abc所以只能从指引矿石着手
<2-29,Cameron>You can't see diamonds so youabclook for the indicator minerals.

66
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:07,560
<2-29,Cameron>假设钻石指的是肿瘤或出血点或别的什么
<2-29,Cameron>I assume the diamond is theabctumor or bleed or whatever it is.

67
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:09,000
<2-29,Cameron>我们可以触发痉挛
<2-29,Cameron>we provoke a seizure.

68
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:12,610
<2-30,Foreman>集中在异常区域的增长电活性就是指引
<2-30,Foreman>The indicator is the increased electricalabcactivity focused around the abnormality.

69

<2-30,Foreman>做个脑电图 看集中在哪abc就知道问题是什么了
<2-30,Foreman>We do an eeg, see the focus, see where theabcproblem is, whh tells us what the problem is.

00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:45,170
<7-17,House>不管你怕什么 你难道不怕死亡么?
<7-17,House>Whatever you're scared ofout there,abcaren't you more scared of death?

234
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:48,160
<7-18,Stewart>很明显你无法与人共处
<7-18,Stewart>You obviouslycan't stand people.

235
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,760
<7-18,Stewart>但我比你更糟
<7-18,Stewart>But for me, it's worse. All right?

236
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:54,780
<7-18,Stewart>我宁可死掉也不出去
<7-18,Stewart>I'd rather die inabchere than live out there.

237
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,340
<7-19,House>如果你对乱糟糟的头发abc和恼人口音没意见的话
<7-19,House>If you don't mind floppyabchair and an annoying accent,

238
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:08,930
<7-19,House>我认识个医生abc可以为你在家里动手术
<7-19,House>I know a surgeonwho willabcoperate in your home.

239
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:11,280
<7-20,Stewart>谢谢
<7-20,Stewart>Thank you.

240
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:17,050
<7-21,Cameron>冒着感染的危险 Chase才不会...
<7-21,Cameron>With the risk of infection,abcchase won't actually--

241
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:21,030
<7-22,House>他才不肯在个疯子家里动手术呢
<7-22,House>he's not gonna do surgeryinabcsome crazy dude's house.

242
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,780
<7-20,Stewart>你刚刚还说...
<7-20,Stewart>You justabcsaid--

243
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,850
<7-24,House>我刚才是说 Chase会在他家里麻醉
<7-24,House>what I said was that chaseabcwould put him under at the house,

244
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,930
<7-24,House>我们带他回医院 开刀 动手术
<7-24,House>we'd take himto the hospital,abcopen him up,do our thing,

245
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:32,070
<7-24,House>再把他带回房间做术后照护abc他就不会发觉我们晃了他
<7-24,House>then slip him backinto his room for the post-opabcwithout him ever finding outthat we tricked him.

246
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,650
<7-24,House>我是想用隐喻来着
<7-24,House>Some of that was implied.

247
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:34,930
<7-26,House>- 这是违背伦理的abc- 他都被麻倒了
<7-26,House>- It's unethical.abc- He'll be asleep.

248
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,110
<7-27,Cameron>即使被麻醉了 他仍有决定权
<7-27,Cameron>He gets to makehis ownabccalls even if he's asleeP.

249
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,870
<7-27,Cameron>你干嘛跟他一拨?
<7-27,Cameron>Why are you sidingwith him?

250
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:44,180
<7-28,House>哦 对啊 你就是喜欢残破的人abc因为你丈夫死了
<7-28,House>Oh, yeah, you're that girlwho likesabcbroken people because her husband died.

251
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:45,390
<7-28,House>而Chase又不那么残破--
<7-28,House>And since chaseabcisn'tall that broken--

252
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,460
<7-29,Cameron>说到这 干嘛不给腿部肌肉梗死的家伙abc动个手术?
<7-29,Cameron>hey, why don't we operateon hisabcinfarcted leg while we're at it?

253
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:49,220
<7-29,Cameron>谁管他同不同意呢
<7-29,Cameron>Who cares if he said no.

254
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:51,240
<7-30,House>我是冒着生命危险abc不想变成个瘸子
<7-30,House>I was risking my lifetoabcavoid becoming a cripple.

255
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:54,750
<7-30,House>他却这样逃避阳光和新鲜空气
<7-30,House>He's doing it toabcavoidsunlight and fresh air.

256
00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:00,210
<7-31,Cameron>我们绝不能出半点岔子
<7-31,Cameron>We've got to make it look good.

257
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:13,570
<8-1,Stewart>我很让人讨厌
<8-1,Stewart>I know I'm a pain in the ass.

258
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:17,480
<8-1,Stewart>转身离开很容易 但是...
<8-1,Stewart>I know it would have beenabceasy just to walk away, but...

259
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:22,420
<8-1,Stewart>你是个好人
<8-1,Stewart>you're a good person.

260
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:30,430
<8-2,Chase>从10开始倒数
<8-2,Chase>Count down from 10.

261
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:36,740
<8-3,Stewart>10 9 8...
<8-3,Stewart>10, 9, 8...

262
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:40,350
<8-4,Chase>走吧!
<8-4,Chase>let's go!

263
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:57,020
<9-1,Wilson>感觉怎么样?
<9-1,Wilson>How you doin'?

264
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,640
<9-2,Cuddy>- 好些了abc- 那就好
<9-2,Cuddy>- Better.abc- Great.

265
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:02,410
<9-3,Wilson>其他也都好?
<9-3,Wilson>Everything else good?

266
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,790
<9-4,Cuddy>呃 我与House那惊鸿一吻的事也都还好
<9-4,Cuddy>Uh, everything involvingabcme kissing house is good.

267
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:06,630
<9-4,Cuddy>哦 天呐 被你八卦到了
<9-4,Cuddy>Oh, god, you dragged itout of me.

268
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:08,590
<9-4,Cuddy>你太厉害了
<9-4,Cuddy>You're a genius.

269
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,030
<9-4,Cuddy>这没什么大不了的
<9-4,Cuddy>It's no big deal.

270
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,820
<9-4,Cuddy>我当时很伤感
<9-4,Cuddy>I was feeling vulnerable.

271
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,510
<9-4,Cuddy>他只是个朋友
<9-4,Cuddy>He's a friend.

272
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,200
<9-4,Cuddy>给我一时的依靠
<9-4,Cuddy>And I leaned on him.

273
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,900
<9-5,Wilson>有意思 我也曾依靠过我的朋友
<9-5,Wilson>It's funny. I've leanedabcon friendsin the past.

274
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:22,560
<9-5,Wilson>但从没靠得那么近abc把舌头都靠到他们嘴里去了
<9-5,Wilson>Never leaned so far myabctonguefell into their mouths.

275
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:26,810
<9-6,Cuddy>我没动过House的心思 从来没有过
<9-6,Cuddy>I don't think of housethatabcway. I never have.

276
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,790
<9-7,Wilson>为什么没有?
<9-7,Wilson>Why not?

277
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,100
<9-7,Wilson>你很清楚结果会怎样
<9-7,Wilson>You know exactlyhow it would go.

278
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,150
<9-8,Cuddy>一开始很刺激
<9-8,Cuddy>It'd start off exciting.

279
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:39,000
<9-8,Cuddy>完全沉迷于新奇感 互不相让abc禁忌中做乐
<9-8,Cuddy>We'd get caught up in the novelty and theabchostility and the forbiddenness.

280
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,950
<9-8,Cuddy>接着意识到打情骂俏变成了势不两立
<9-8,Cuddy>And then we'd realize that theabcflirty hostility is just hostility

281
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,150
<9-8,Cuddy>而他抑郁的气质也不那么刺激了abc反而让人觉得沮丧
<9-8,Cuddy>and his inabilityto open up is noabclonger exciting,it's just frustrating.

282
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:51,740
<9-8,Cuddy>然后 双方无可避免地abc开始争吵 相互指责
<9-8,Cuddy>And--and then it'sthe inevitableabcblowup and the recriminations

283
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:55,670
<9-8,Cuddy>两个月都不跟对方说话
<9-8,Cuddy>and we don't talkfor two months.

284
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,610
<9-9,Wilson>是哦
<9-9,Wilson>Yeah.

285
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:03,220
<9-9,Wilson>还真是证明了你从来没对House动过心思
<9-9,Wilson>Well, it certainly proves you'veabcnever thoughtabout house that way.

286
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,940
<9-10,Cuddy>我明白你的意思了
<9-10,Cuddy>I get your point.

287
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:08,170
<9-10,Cuddy>以后我说话会多加小心
<9-10,Cuddy>I will be more carefulwithabcmy tongue in the future.

288
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:10,640
<9-11,Wilson>我不是这个意思
<9-11,Wilson>That's not my point.

289
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:16,300
<9-11,Wilson>也许玩玩新鲜 闹闹别扭 破破规矩abc也不一定会遗憾收场
<9-11,Wilson>Maybe novelty and hostilityandabcforbidden-ness doesn't have to end bad.

290
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,830
<9-12,Cuddy>得走了
<9-12,Cuddy>Gotta go.

291
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,110
<10-1,Chase>你什么时候下班?
<10-1,Chase>What time you done?

292
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:28,630
<10-1,Chase>我们可以去我家附近abc新开的寿司店尝尝鲜
<10-1,Chase>We could trythat new sushiabcplace next to my house.

293
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:30,740
<10-2,Cameron>今晚去我那怎么样?
<10-2,Cameron>Why don't we stayat my house tonight?

294
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:31,840
<10-3,Chase>咱们总是住我家的啊
<10-3,Chase>We always stayat mine.

295
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:35,140
<10-4,Cameron>我就是这意思 以前是轮流住的abc怎么变了呢?
<10-4,Cameron>That's what I mean. We--weabcused to split it. What happened?

296
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,590
<10-5,Chase>不知道 上班近点呗
<10-5,Chase>I don't know. Closer to work.

297
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,800
<10-6,Cameron>近5分钟而已
<10-6,Cameron>By five minutes.

298
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:41,300
<10-6,Cameron>而且我家看着可不像是abc醉酒的橄榄球员装修的
<10-6,Cameron>Anmy house doesn't looklike it wasabcdecorated by a drunk rugby player.

299
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,670
<10-7,Cameron>我们晚些再讨论吧 我还没...
<10-7,Cameron>Well, we can discussabcit.I hadn't really--

300
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,100
<10-8,Chase>干嘛还非得讨论?abc你就不能过来住一晚么?
<10-8,Chase>why does it haveto be aabcdiscussion? Can't you juststay over?

301
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:52,870
<10-9,Cuddy>你们该知道 那么多手术器械被签出的时候abc他们会通知我
<10-9,Cuddy>You do know they page me when thatabcmuch surgical equipment is signed out.

302
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,290
<11-1,Cuddy>- 他没有同意abc- 他同意手术了 难道还会上诉手术地?
<11-1,Cuddy>He didn't consent. He consentedto theabcsurgery. You think he's gonnasue over where?

303
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,320
<11-3,Chase>他根本不知情 他醒来的时候就在家了abc他不会知道发生了什么
<11-3,Chase>He won't even know where. He'll wake up in hisabchouse. He won't know a thing about what happened.

304
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:04,580
<11-4,Cuddy>除非他在肮脏的小房子里发生了abc术后感染 然后发觉我们晃了他
<11-4,Cuddy>Until he catchesa post-surgical infection inabchis dirty apartmentand finds out we tricked him

305
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:07,340
<11-4,Cuddy>最终怪到医院头上
<11-4,Cuddy>and winds up owningthe hospital.

306
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:09,670
<11-5,Cameron>你干嘛不跟她争论?
<11-5,Cameron>Why aren't you arguingwith her?

307
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:12,200
<11-6,House>因为她说得对
<11-6,House>Because she's right.

308
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,830
<11-6,House>我才不在乎他在哪感染abc但不能感染
<11-6,House>I don't care where he gets theabcpost-op, just that he gets it.

309
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,130
<11-6,House>把他留在医院
<11-6,House>Keep him here.

310
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:25,910
<11-7,Cuddy>House 你还好么?
<11-7,Cuddy>House. You okay?

311
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,350
<11-8,House>好得很 我们不用详谈
<11-8,House>Yes. We don't need to talk.

<11-9,Cuddy>Your hand.

313
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:33,510
<11-10,House>真诡异
<11-10,House>That's weird.

314
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:37,430
<11-10,House>我一般到复活节才会有圣痕
<11-10,House>I usually don't get theabcstigmata until easter.

315
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:45,920
<12-1,Cameron>告诉Chase医生abc病人已准备好进行手术了
<12-1,Cameron>Please tell dr. Chase theabcpatient's ready for him now.

<13-1,Cuddy>病人叫了律师 威胁说要告我们
<13-1,Cuddy>Your patientcalled hisabclawyer, threatened to sue us.

<13-1,Cuddy>他现在回家去了 完全没有确诊
<13-1,Cuddy>He's now heading homeabccompletely undiagnosed.

<13-3,Cuddy>Not anymore you won'T.

339

<20-11,Wilson>Okay.

492
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:57,090

<20-13,Wilson>你说什么?
<20-13,Wilson>Pardon me?

504
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,060
<21-2,Cameron>不 但你限制了我们可用的手段
<21-2,Cameron>No. But you've kindof tied our hands.

<21-2,Cameron>Stewart, I know you don'tabcwant to talk about this, but...

<21-2,Cameron>没什么好羞愧的
<21-2,Cameron>It's nothing to be ashamed of.

00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:21,870
<21-5,Stewart>我中枪前就是这样了
<21-5,Stewart>I was like thisbefore the shooting.

517
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,100
<21-5,Stewart>我还是个孩子时
<21-5,Stewart>Sie I was a kid.

519
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:34,020
<21-5,Stewart>我-我不怎么出门 一旦出门...
<21-5,Stewart>I--I didn't go outthatabcmuch. And--and when I did...

520
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,410
<21-5,Stewart>恐惧就会袭来
<21-5,Stewart>I had panic attacks.

521
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:40,750
<21-5,Stewart>和肉体上的痛楚无异
<21-5,Stewart>Like physical pain.

522

<21-5,Stewart>不 比这还要糟糕abc像是快死了一样

523
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:47,850
<21-5,Stewart>直至遇到Angela
<21-5,Stewart>Then I met angela.

524
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:55,220
<21-5,Stewart>她是我唯一想出门的理由
<21-5,Stewart>She was the only reasonabcthat I ever wantedto go out.

525
00:27:56,250 --> 00:28:00,540
<21-5,Stewart>但后来她死了...
<21-5,Stewart>But then she died. And...

526
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:15,920
<22-1,Taub>血液测试快做好了
<22-1,Taub>Blood test will be done soon.

527
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:23,940
<22-2,Taub>我猜 这是一项新的检测技术
<22-2,Taub>I'm guessing that's a new technique.

528
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:28,690
<22-3,House>嘿 还记得Cameron那个主意么?abc"折磨病人迫使他承认自己的问题"
<22-3,House>Hey, you remember that idea that cameron had aboutabctrying to torture the patient into admitting himself?

529
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,470
<22-4,Taub>我很笃定这是你的主意
<22-4,Taub>Pretty sureit was your idea.

530
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:32,210
<22-4,Taub>你想我拖延测试?
<22-4,Taub>You want me to slow down the test?

531
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:35,660
<22-5,House>瓦 今天每个人都变得好聪明
<22-5,House>Everyone's got allabcthesegreat ideas today.

532
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:40,480
<22-5,House>病人不肯离开 是因为会带来痛楚abc我们就让他留在房间里更痛苦
<22-5,House>So you're thinking patient won't leave because leavingabccauses pain, so we gotta make staying more painful.

533
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,600
<22-5,House>这招肯定能行
<22-5,House>That actually makes sense.

534
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:44,110
<22-6,Taub>你只能增加他的痛楚abc但还不足以让他出门
<22-6,Taub>You'll increase his pain, butabcnot enoughto make a difference.

535
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:45,260
<22-6,Taub>他在注射吗啡
<22-6,Taub>He's on morphine.

536
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,520
<22-7,House>他现在有吗啡护航
<22-7,House>He's on morphine now.

537
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:48,850
<22-7,House>很快就没这待遇了
<22-7,House>Pretty soon he'll beon less-phine.

538
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:53,550
<22-7,House>因为当你去补充药物时abc会把点滴换成生理盐水
<22-7,House>'Cause when you restock, you'll actuallyabcbe givingcameron iv bags of saline.

539
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,140
<22-8,Taub>你凭什么认为我会这么干?
<22-8,Taub>And why do you thinkI'll be doing this?

540
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:56,450
<22-9,House>和你答应做手术一个理由
<22-9,House>Same reason you didthe surgery.

541
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,350

551
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:29,290
<22-12,Taub>而是为了救他的命

552
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:33,730
<22-13,House>没错 我会这么对大伙说的
