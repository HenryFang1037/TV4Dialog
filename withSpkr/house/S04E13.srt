<12-12,AMBER>You're going mini-golfing./What's it matter?

348
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,000
<12-12,AMBER>难道还有开球时间限制不成?
<12-12,AMBER>You got a tee off time?

349
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:41,650
<12-13,HOUSE>关系重大 因为关系多重大不该你说了算
<12-13,HOUSE>It matters because you don't/get to decide what matters.

350
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,370
<12-14,WILSON>是我的错 我得冲个凉
<12-14,WILSON>It was my fault. I had to take a shower.

351
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:46,180
<12-15,AMBER>还是我的错
<12-15,AMBER>Which was my fault.

352
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:48,510
<12-16,HOUSE>我还得去拉屎
<12-16,HOUSE>I had to take a dump.

353
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,990
<12-16,HOUSE>你走之前还有啥我不必知道的事儿要说?
<12-16,HOUSE>Anything else I don't need/to know before you leave?

354
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,610
<12-17,AMBER>游乐时间玩得开心点
<12-17,AMBER>Have fun on your play date.

355
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,960
<12-17,AMBER>你有妈咪的电话对吗?
<12-17,AMBER>You've got mommy's numbers,right?

356
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:01,820
<12-18,HOUSE>爹地要先喝一杯
<12-18,HOUSE>Daddy needs a drink.

357
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:11,800
<13-1,THIRTEEN>我在想 要是我们别多管那个善良问题--
<13-1,THIRTEEN>I was thinking,if we/discount the niceness issue--

358
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:13,430
<13-2,FOREMAN>坐吧
<13-2,FOREMAN>sit down.

359
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:18,790
<13-3,THIRTEEN>我想可能是心脏缺陷
<13-3,THIRTEEN>I think it's a heart defect.

360
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:19,940
<13-4,FOREMAN>超声波上没啥不正常
<13-4,FOREMAN>Nothing on the echo.

361
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:21,330
<13-5,THIRTEEN>可能是卵圆孔未闭
<13-5,THIRTEEN>Could bea patent foramen ovale.

362
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,740
<13-5,THIRTEEN>可以解释中风和昏厥
<13-5,THIRTEEN>It explains the stroke,and the syncope,

363
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,490
<13-5,THIRTEEN>卵圆孔未闭在常规超声心动图中不会显示
<13-5,THIRTEEN>and a pfo wouldn't show/up on a routine echo.

364
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,840
<13-5,THIRTEEN>我去做个心脏超声造影
<13-5,THIRTEEN>I'm gonna do a bubble test.

365
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:28,860
<13-6,FOREMAN>有时间吗?
<13-6,FOREMAN>You got a minute first?

366
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:31,840
<13-7,THIRTEEN>当然
<13-7,THIRTEEN>Sure.

367
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,670
<13-8,FOREMAN>我认为你在困境下显示出非凡的能力
<13-8,FOREMAN>I think you've shown remarkable/strength in a difficult situation.

368
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,140
<13-9,THIRTEEN>你来写我的表现评估?
<13-9,THIRTEEN>Are you giving me a performance review?

369
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,390
<13-10,FOREMAN>评语很优秀
<13-10,FOREMAN>A good one.

370
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,830
<13-11,THIRTEEN>我去做心脏超声造影
<13-11,THIRTEEN>I'm gonna do a bubble test.

371
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:46,000
<13-12,KUTNER>他入院时抽的血样够做个梅毒血清测试
<13-12,KUTNER>there was enough blood left over from/his admission work-up to run the vdrl.

372
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:47,100
<13-13,FOREMAN>你怀疑你的病人
<13-13,FOREMAN>You doubted your patient.

373
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,050
<13-14,KUTNER>不 我怎么想不重要
<13-14,KUTNER>No,what I thought didn't matter.

374
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,250
<13-14,KUTNER>House说了 如果不先排除神经性梅毒/就不让我们继续
<13-14,KUTNER>House said he wouldn't let us go/on until we ruled out neurosyphilis.

375
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,380
<13-15,FOREMAN>不是神经性梅毒 是卵圆孔未闭
<13-15,FOREMAN>It's not neurosyphilis;it's a pfo.

376
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:57,370
<13-16,KUTNER>就是神经性梅毒
<13-16,KUTNER>It's neurosyphilis.

377
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:59,920
<13-16,KUTNER>检测结果是阳性
<13-16,KUTNER>The tests were positive.

378
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:05,730
<13-16,KUTNER>总是老生常谈
<13-16,KUTNER>it's always the same conversation.

379
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:06,900
<14-1,TAUB>他们告诉你肯定是你弄错了
<14-1,TAUB>They tell you you must be mistaken,

380
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:09,370
<14-1,TAUB>所以我总是把测试做两遍
<14-1,TAUB>which is why I always/run the tests twice,

381
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,490
<14-1,TAUB>然后他们就指责自己的伴侣
<14-1,TAUB>and then they blame the other guy,

382
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:12,100
<14-1,TAUB>要他们无辜的话 这样就说得通
<14-1,TAUB>which makes sense if they're innocent,

383
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:13,790
<14-1,TAUB>但很明显 一半的人并不无辜
<14-1,TAUB>but obviously,half of 'em aren't.

384
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,580
<14-1,TAUB>他们没明白自己已经被揭穿了
<14-1,TAUB>They don't seem to/get that they're busted.

385
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,270
<14-1,TAUB>被科学证明了
<14-1,TAUB>Scientifically proven.

386
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,130
<14-2,THIRTEEN>除非你的配偶也出轨
<14-2,THIRTEEN>Unless your spouse cheated too.

387
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,160
<14-3,TAUB>正是如此 那种情况下你最希望的/就是这样
<14-3,TAUB>Exactly. That's what you're/praying for in that moment.

388
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:22,070
<14-3,TAUB>她也出轨了
<14-3,TAUB>That she cheated too.

389
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,100
<14-3,TAUB>如果她不想杀了你 你便能知道她也出轨了
<14-3,TAUB>And then if she doesn't/kill you,you know that she did.

390
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,510
<14-3,TAUB>你知道她背叛了你
<14-3,TAUB>You know she betrayed you.

391
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:30,870
<14-3,TAUB>然后 你意识到这样更糟
<14-3,TAUB>And then,you realize that/that sucks worse.

392
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,460
<15-1,JEFF>测试结果肯定错了
<15-1,JEFF>The test must be wrong.

393
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:38,370
<15-2,KUTNER>我做了两遍
<15-2,KUTNER>I ran it twice.

394
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:40,150
<15-3,JEFF>不是说那个测试
<15-3,JEFF>Not that test.

395
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:42,880
<15-3,JEFF>是我十年前做的那个
<15-3,JEFF>The one I took ten years ago.

396
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:46,090
<15-3,JEFF>要不还有怎么解释?
<15-3,JEFF>What other explanation is there?

397
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,600
<15-4,DEB>他完全想不到还有其它可能性
<15-4,DEB>He really sees no other possibility.

398
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,340
<15-5,KUTNER>你有外遇吗?
<15-5,KUTNER>Did you have an affair?

399
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,390
<15-6,DEB>没有
<15-6,DEB>No.

400
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:03,020
<15-7,KUTNER>那你为什么不对他发火?
<15-7,KUTNER>Then why aren't you angry with him?

401
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:10,060
<15-8,DEB>- 你认识老好人吗?/- 没有
<15-8,DEB>- You ever know anybody who's just too nice?/- No.

402
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:15,480
<15-9,KUTNER>很讨人厌--然后你意识到讨厌的原因是/他们让你看到自己的缺点
<15-9,KUTNER>It's annoying--then you realize it's annoying/because they remind you of what you are not.

403
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:18,480
<15-10,DEB>你永远不可能跟他们一样好
<15-10,DEB>That you'll never be as good as they are.

404
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:22,140
<15-10,DEB>然后你会想 我为什么不能?
<15-10,DEB>And then you think,why can't I?

405
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:32,760
<15-10,DEB>你还没意识到/那个你嘲弄的傻瓜就让你变成了更好的人
<15-10,DEB>And before you know it,that naive idiot you/laughed at has made you a better person.

406
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:39,400
<15-10,DEB>你真觉得我这些年是爱上了个病症?
<15-10,DEB>You really think I've been in/love all these years with a symptom?

407
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:45,380
<15-11,KUTNER>要是梅毒造成了大脑损伤/而损伤引起人格变化
<15-11,KUTNER>If syphilis caused lesions in his brain,and/the lesions caused personality changes,

408
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:49,320
<15-11,KUTNER>等他情况好转后/你可能会注意到他的变化
<15-11,KUTNER>you may notice a change in/him as his condition improves.

409
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:51,650
<15-12,DEB>我了解我丈夫
<15-12,DEB>I know my husband.

410
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,990
<15-12,DEB>他不会变的
<15-12,DEB>He's not gonna change.

411
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,960
<15-13,KUTNER>你最好也检查一下
<15-13,KUTNER>You should get yourself tested.

412
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,690
<16-1,KUTNER>正态分布理论就是如此
<16-1,KUTNER>So much for the bell curve.

413
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:06,580
<16-1,KUTNER>凭什么House是个混蛋不是病态/而人太好了就是病呢?
<16-1,KUTNER>How can House be an ass without it being an/illness,but niceness is a biological crime?

414
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:08,350
<16-2,TAUB>你有五块钱吗?
<16-2,TAUB>You got five bucks?

415
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,220
<16-3,KUTNER>有
<16-3,KUTNER>Uh,yeah.

416
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:13,670
<16-4,TAUB>人好就让你损失了五块钱
<16-4,TAUB>Niceness just cost you five bucks.

417
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,580
<16-4,TAUB>而混蛋一般都能得益
<16-4,TAUB>Being an ass generally turns a profit.

418
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,460
<16-5,FOREMAN>Kutner 你能让我们俩单独待着吗?
<16-5,FOREMAN>Kutner,could you excuse us?

419
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,380
<16-5,FOREMAN>我得做Taub的评估
<16-5,FOREMAN>I need to do taub's review.

420
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,150
<16-6,TAUB>你留下来
<16-6,TAUB>You can stay.

421
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:24,890
<16-7,FOREMAN>我想这私底下进行比较好
<16-7,FOREMAN>I think it would be better if/this was done privately.

422
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,500
<16-8,TAUB>根本不可能真做评估
<16-8,TAUB>This isn't gonna be done.

423
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,570
<16-9,FOREMAN>你们这是怎么了?/我以前也给过你们建议啊
<16-9,FOREMAN>What is it with you guys?/I've given you advice before.

424
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:29,850
<16-10,TAUB>不是以我们上司的身份
<16-10,TAUB>Not as our boss.

425
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:32,210
<16-11,FOREMAN>区别在哪儿? 建议就是建议
<16-11,FOREMAN>What's the difference? Advice is advice.

426
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:32,890
<16-12,TAUB>成
<16-12,TAUB>Fair enough.

427
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:34,700
<16-12,TAUB>我先说
<16-12,TAUB>I'll go first.

428
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:39,570
<16-12,TAUB>你表现出极度的自信 让我很不爽
<16-12,TAUB>You demonstrate a great air of/confidence,which is really pissing me off.

429
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,950
<16-14,TAUB>- House授权我--/- 你认识他多久了? 他在利用你
<16-14,TAUB>- House authorized me--/- how long have you known him? He's using you.

430
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,370
<16-15,FOREMAN>我主动提出的 因为我知道他肯定不会
<16-15,FOREMAN>I volunteered because I knew he wouldn'T.

431
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,610
<16-16,TAUB>他根本不在乎那些文书工作
<16-16,TAUB>He could care less about the paperwork.

432
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,530
<16-14,TAUB>他利用你 整你
<16-14,TAUB>He's using you to screw with you.

433
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,810
<16-16,TAUB>他知道这会让我们不爽
<16-16,TAUB>He knows it'll annoy us.

434
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:50,320
<16-16,TAUB>我们会跟你对着干 迫使你看清现实
<16-16,TAUB>We'll stand up to you,which will/force you to confront the fact

435
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,820
<16-16,TAUB>虽然你以为自己比我们等级高
<16-16,TAUB>that even though you/think you're our superior,

436
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:53,080
<16-16,TAUB>你其实跟我们一样
<16-16,TAUB>you're no different from us.

437
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:57,380
<16-16,TAUB>他给你权威是让你知道自己的位置
<16-16,TAUB>He gave you authority/to keep you in your place.

438
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:59,310
<16-17,KUTNER>是真的
<16-17,KUTNER>It's true.

439
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,000
<16-18,FOREMAN>谢了
<16-18,FOREMAN>Thanks.

440
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:02,010

<16-19,KUTNER>Not him,what'd he say?

441
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,750
<16-20,TAUB>没什么 你说什么是真的?
<16-20,TAUB>Nothing,what's true?

442
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,250
<16-21,KUTNER>这人肯定有问题
<16-21,KUTNER>There's something wrong with this guy,

443
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:07,580
<16-21,KUTNER>就说明House肯定有问题
<16-21,KUTNER>it means there's/something wrong with House.

444
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:17,500
<17-1,WILSON>你想把我灌醉吗?
<17-1,WILSON>Are you trying to get me drunk?

00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:24,380
<17-3,WILSON>她会杀了你的
<17-3,WILSON>She'll kill you.

448

<17-4,HOUSE>我会在熄灯前把你弄回家的
<17-4,HOUSE>I'll get you home before lights out.

449

<17-5,WILSON>很好 那她就会杀了我
<17-5,WILSON>Great. Then she'll kill me.

454
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:47,140
<17-6,HOUSE>你有没有意识到/你的某位前妻跟我说起过
<17-6,HOUSE>You'd think that one or more of your/ex-wives would have mentioned that to me.

455
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:48,840
<17-7,WILSON>她们连这个都告诉你?
<17-7,WILSON>They told you?
