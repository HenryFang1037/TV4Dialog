786
00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:16,120
<1-1,House>要怎么做
<1-1,House>So how is this supposed to work?

787
00:44:16,330 --> 00:44:18,560
<1-2,Nolan>你我相对而坐  谈心聊天
<1-2,Nolan>You sit. I sit. We talk.

788
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:20,700
<1-4,Nolan>-谈什么  -想谈什么都行
<1-4,Nolan>- About what? -About whatever you want.

789
00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:22,650
<1-5,House>你想听我抱怨我老妈吗
<1-5,House>You want me to whine about my mother?

790
00:44:22,810 --> 00:44:24,410
<1-6,Nolan>你想抱怨你老妈吗
<1-6,Nolan>Do you want to whine about your mother?

791
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:28,090
<1-7,House>我可以跟你说我五岁时我的金鱼死了的事
<1-7,House>I can tell you about the time I was five and my goldfish died.

792
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:29,910
<1-8,Nolan>如果你想从那开始
<1-8,Nolan>If that's where you'd like to start.

793
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:33,190
<1-9,House>我生命中的经历数不胜数
<1-9,House>I've had a billion things happen to me in my life.

794
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:34,790
<1-9,House>我怎么知道那件事是有关系的
<1-9,House>How am I supposed to know which ones are relevant?

795
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:36,550
<1-10,Nolan>依我看来  所有的事都是有联系的
<1-10,Nolan>As far as I'm concerned, they're all relevant.

796
00:44:36,770 --> 00:44:38,000
<1-11,House>好吧  那么我们最好快点
<1-11,House>Well, we better get moving,

797
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:40,160
<1-11,House>不然得花五十年听我叨叨
<1-11,House>Cause this session could take 50 years.

798
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:42,710
<1-12,Nolan>没错  你是所有经历的集合
<1-12,Nolan>Yes, you are the sum of everything that's happened to you

799
00:44:42,730 --> 00:44:46,360
<1-12,Nolan>的确如此  有些经历影响更深远
<1-12,Nolan>And, yes, some events are more relevant than others.

800
00:44:46,990 --> 00:44:49,340
<1-12,Nolan>可是  唯一能找出关键经历的方法
<1-12,Nolan>But, uh, the only way we can figure out which ones are

801
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:50,330
<1-12,Nolan>就是聊天
<1-12,Nolan>Is to talk.

802
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,190
<1-12,Nolan>告诉我吧
<1-12,Nolan>So tell me,

803
00:44:52,910 --> 00:44:53,640
<1-12,Nolan>你在想什么
<1-12,Nolan>What's on your mind?

804
00:44:55,010 --> 00:44:55,710
<1-12,Nolan>你想要什么
<1-12,Nolan>What do you want?

805
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:00,470
<1-13,House>我想好起来
<1-13,House>I want to get better...

806
00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:04,490
<1-13,House>不管是什么意思
<1-13,House>Whatever the hell that means.

807
00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:07,220
<1-13,House>我厌恶苦不堪言的生活
<1-13,House>I'm sick of being miserable.

808
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:08,600
<1-14,Nolan>所以你想快乐起来
<1-14,Nolan>So you'd like to be happy?

809
00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:11,520
<1-15,House>不用想也知道  没错  我要快乐
<1-15,House>Again with the reflecting yes, I'd like to be happy.

810
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:13,110
<1-16,Nolan>快乐是个很棒的目标
<1-16,Nolan>Being happy is an excellent goal.

811
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:15,580
<1-16,Nolan>很多病人甚至不知道
<1-16,Nolan>Not many patients can crystallize

812
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,270
<1-16,Nolan>自己想要摆脱什么
<1-16,Nolan>Exactly what they're hoping to get out of this.

813
00:45:17,290 --> 00:45:18,580
<1-17,House>我好怕哦
<1-17,House>Well, bully for me.

814
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:20,570
<1-18,Nolan>所以现在所要做的就是
<1-18,Nolan>So now all we have to do

815
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:24,430
<1-18,Nolan>找出怎么让你从这此找到快乐
<1-18,Nolan>Is figure out how to get you from here to happy.

816
00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:28,150
<1-19,House>抗抑郁药吗
<1-19,House>Ssris?

817
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:29,960
<1-19,House>这就是你的天才办法吗
<1-19,House>That's your genius technique?

818
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:32,020
<1-20,Nolan>我们不该放弃任何有帮助的方式
<1-20,Nolan>I don't think we should ignore any tools that can help.

819
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:34,950
<1-20,Nolan>我知道你不怕吃药
<1-20,Nolan>I know you don't have a problem taking drugs.

820
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:37,170
<1-21,House>那是因为我的腿疼
<1-21,House>For my leg, for pain.

821
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,610
<1-22,Nolan>那就当作这是治精神疼痛的药
<1-22,Nolan>Well, think of this as being for psychic pain.

822
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:44,600
<1-23,House>我不想改变自己
<1-23,House>I don't want to change who I am.

823
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:46,020
<1-23,House>你痛苦吗
<1-23,House>Miserable?

824
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:54,100
<1-24,Nolan>你觉得药物会抹去你的过人之处
<1-24,Nolan>Do you think that by taking meds you'll lose your edge,

825
00:45:54,670 --> 00:45:57,540
<1-24,Nolan>再也没有让你如此出色的独到见解
<1-24,Nolan>Stop making the unique connections that make you a successful doctor?

826
00:45:58,070 --> 00:46:00,050
<1-25,House>如果梵高是你的病人
<1-25,House>If Van Gogh was your patient,

827
00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:01,910
<1-25,House>他就想要刷房子
<1-25,House>He'd be satisfied painting houses

828
00:46:01,930 --> 00:46:03,170
<1-25,House>而不是画出传世佳作《繁星夜晚》
<1-25,House>Instead of the "Starry Night".

829
00:46:03,290 --> 00:46:04,200
<1-25,House>梵高
<1-25,House>Van Gogh

830
00:46:04,310 --> 00:46:06,790
<1-26,Nolan>仍然会画出让世人赞叹的夜空
<1-26,Nolan>Would still be making inspired paintings of the night sky,

831
00:46:07,430 --> 00:46:09,350
<1-26,Nolan>只是不会在收容所里
<1-26,Nolan>Just maybe not from the room of his asylum.

832
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:11,160
<1-27,House>-这你可说不准  -我就知道
<1-27,House>- You don't know that. - I know

833
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:13,400
<1-28,Nolan>他的耳朵会完好无缺
<1-28,Nolan>Both his ears would be intact.

834
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,880
<1-28,Nolan>还有他的生活会好很多
<1-28,Nolan>And I know his life would be better.

835
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,960
<1-28,Nolan>我知道这对你来说不容易
<1-28,Nolan>I know this doesn't come naturally to you.

836
00:46:32,530 --> 00:46:33,600
<1-28,Nolan>可你需要我的帮助
<1-28,Nolan>But you want my help,

837
00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:36,270
<1-28,Nolan>你就要信任我
<1-28,Nolan>Which means you need to trust me.

838
00:46:49,290 --> 00:46:50,250
<1-29,House>好吃
<1-29,House>Delicious.

839
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:02,960
<2-1,Alvie>你怎么在这里
<2-1,Alvie>Why are you here?

840
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:06,680
<2-2,House>我在等上帝赐食
<2-2,House>I'm waiting for my communion wafer.

841
00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:15,280
<2-3,Alvie>你没有咽下去  对吧
<2-3,Alvie>You're cheeking it, right?

842
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:16,810
<2-4,House>没
<2-4,House>Nope.

843
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:19,040
<2-5,Alvie>跟我说你是装的
<2-5,Alvie>Tell me you're cheeking it.

844
00:47:20,650 --> 00:47:21,630
<2-6,House>我咽下去了
<2-6,House>I swallowed it.

845
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:23,830
<2-7,Alvie>怎么会  我们不吃药的
<2-7,Alvie>No, you didn't. We don't take meds.

846
00:47:23,850 --> 00:47:26,550
<2-8,House>是你不吃药  阿瓦  我可想保持头脑清醒
<2-8,House>You don't take meds, Alvie. I decided to get sane.

847
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:28,900
<2-9,Alvie>你在耍花招的  快说啊
<2-9,Alvie>You're scamming again. You can tell me.

848
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:30,540
<2-10,House>没什么花招  阿瓦
<2-10,House>I'm not scamming, Alvie.

849
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:32,650
<2-11,Alvie>他们打败了你
<2-11,Alvie>They broke you.

850
00:47:36,870 --> 00:47:37,910
<2-12,House>他们没有打败我
<2-12,House>They didn't break me.

851
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:40,150
<2-12,House>我早已一败涂地了
<2-12,House>I am broken.

852
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:44,320
<2-12,House>别再把我当偶像了
<2-12,House>Now stop worshipping me

853
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:46,260
<2-12,House>好好想想你的悲惨人生吧
<2-12,House>And go and worry about your own loser life.

854
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:51,090
<2-13,Alvie>我恨你
<2-13,Alvie>I hate you.

855
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:03,710
<3-1,House>舞会吗
<3-1,House>Prom?

856
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:05,120
<3-2,Nolan>给你一个任务
<3-2,Nolan>Got an assignment for you.

857
00:48:05,530 --> 00:48:06,530
<3-3,House>角色扮演
<3-3,House>Role-playing?

858
00:48:08,350 --> 00:48:11,900
<3-3,House>我可不觉得装成个恋脚癖的商人有什么用
<3-3,House>I'm not sure how pretending to be a businessman with a foot fetish is gonna help,

859
00:48:11,970 --> 00:48:12,740
<3-3,House>可是我奉陪到底
<3-3,House>But I'm game.

860
00:48:13,670 --> 00:48:15,850
<3-4,Nolan>你和其他病人有紧密联系吗
<3-4,Nolan>Have you connected with any of the other patients?

861
00:48:17,070 --> 00:48:18,070
<3-4,Nolan>已经来这里四周了
<3-4,Nolan>You've been here four weeks.

862
00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:20,600
<3-4,Nolan>说说和其他病人处的怎么样
<3-4,Nolan>Tell me about your relationships with the other patients.

863
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:23,020
<3-4,Nolan>黛安
<3-4,Nolan>Diane...

864
00:48:23,390 --> 00:48:25,810
<3-5,House>觉得沉默女讨厌她
<3-5,House>Is convinced that silent girl hates her.

865
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:27,720
<3-5,House>里克特没有你想得那么偏执
<3-5,House>Richter's not as paranoid as you think.

866
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:29,020
<3-5,House>可他喜欢让你们这么想
<3-5,House>He just likes that you think that.

867
00:48:29,970 --> 00:48:31,170
<3-5,House>还有我的室友恨我
<3-5,House>And my roommate hates me.

868
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:32,760
<3-6,Nolan>只有一件事
<3-6,Nolan>Only one of the things you said

869
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:34,900
<3-6,Nolan>提到别人对你的感觉
<3-6,Nolan>Indicated how somebody else feels about you.

870
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:35,930
<3-6,Nolan>这么说
<3-6,Nolan>So...

871
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:39,760
<3-7,House>我相信仅靠初步分析
<3-7,House>I'm sure that they've done some form

872
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:42,550
<3-7,House>他们就可以得出"我是混蛋"的结论
<3-7,House>Of rudimentary analysis on me, concluded that I'm a jerk.

873
00:48:42,650 --> 00:48:45,210
<3-8,Nolan>有办法能消除他们的成见
<3-8,Nolan>You know, there is a way for them to find out things about you

874
00:48:45,570 --> 00:48:47,080
<3-8,Nolan>不用逻辑推理吗
<3-8,Nolan>Without deductive reasoning.

875
00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:49,030
<3-9,House>我能处理好人际关系
<3-9,House>I have had relationships.

876
00:48:49,150 --> 00:48:52,070
<3-10,Nolan>你总毁掉人际关系  会伤害身边的每一个人
<3-10,Nolan>You've screwed up relationships, every one of them

877
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:53,500
<3-10,Nolan>甚至像是有意而为
<3-10,Nolan>Almost like that was the goal.

878
00:48:54,210 --> 00:48:55,600
<3-10,Nolan>我希望你
<3-10,Nolan>I want you

879
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:56,790
<3-10,Nolan>信任
<3-10,Nolan>To trust...

880
00:48:58,470 --> 00:48:59,120
<3-10,Nolan>别人
<3-10,Nolan>People.

881
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:01,800
<3-10,Nolan>试试吧
<3-10,Nolan>Try.

882
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:06,430
<3-10,Nolan>穿戴好
<3-10,Nolan>Get dressed.

883
00:49:26,070 --> 00:49:27,130
<4-1,House>只要敞开心扉吗
<4-1,House>Just open up?

884
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:30,390
<4-1,House>没错  敞开心扉
<4-1,House>Just open up.

885
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:31,770
<4-2,Nolan>学着信任
<4-2,Nolan>Trust.

886
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:33,180
<4-3,House>从陌生人开始吗
<4-3,House>Strangers?

887
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,350
<4-4,Nolan>一般是先从陌生人开始
<4-4,Nolan>We'll start with strangers,

888
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:36,700
<4-4,Nolan>循序渐进
<4-4,Nolan>Then work our way up.

889
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:39,910
<4-4,Nolan>如果过火了
<4-4,Nolan>If it helps,

890
00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:42,650
<4-4,Nolan>我就用"你好"来帮你打圆场
<4-4,Nolan>I find "hello" to be an excellent icebreaker.

891
00:49:51,650 --> 00:49:52,220
<4-5,House>嗨
<4-5,House>Hi.

892
00:49:54,530 --> 00:49:55,140
<4-5,House>嗨
<4-5,House>Hi.

893
00:49:56,170 --> 00:49:58,020
<4-7,House>像是"你好"的简化版
<4-7,House>It's like "hello," only shorter.

894
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:00,630
<4-7,House>是啊
<4-7,House>Yes.

895
00:50:01,910 --> 00:50:03,640
<4-8,Garney>能省点时间是件好事
<4-8,Garney>I'm glad we were able to save that time.

896
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:06,390
<4-9,House>您衣着光鲜  应该是捐赠人吧
<4-9,House>Judging by the fancy suit, I'd say you were a donor.

897
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:10,140
<4-9,House>您坐立不安  遇到烦心事了吗
<4-9,House>The nervous demeanor says maybe you've had issues,

898
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:13,230
<4-9,House>可能这地方对你来说有特殊意义
<4-9,House>Probably is why this place has personal meaning.

899
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:15,870
<4-9,House>其实是我闹心
<4-9,House>But this is supposed to be about me.

900
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:20,020
<4-9,House>我利用了我的朋友
<4-9,House>I take advantage of my friends.

901
00:50:22,470 --> 00:50:23,630
<4-9,House>真的只是朋友
<4-9,House>Friend, really

902
00:50:24,150 --> 00:50:25,100
<4-9,House>我就那么一个
<4-9,House>I've only got one.

903
00:50:26,570 --> 00:50:27,950
<4-10,Garney>有时是挺艰苦
<4-10,Garney>It can be tough sometimes.

904
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:29,620
<4-11,House>我可不是同性恋
<4-11,House>I'm not gay.

905
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:30,810
<4-12,Garney>我也不是
<4-12,Garney>Oh, neither am I.

906
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:31,850
<4-13,House>实际上  我是的
<4-13,House>Actually, I am.

907
00:50:33,290 --> 00:50:34,200
<4-13,House>看到那边那位帅哥吗
<4-13,House>See that guy over there?

908
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:37,030
<4-13,House>我的爱人
<4-13,House>He's my lover.

909
00:50:37,810 --> 00:50:39,200
<4-13,House>还是我的心理医生
<4-13,House>He's also my psychiatrist,

910
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:41,060
<4-13,House>有人说这不合适
<4-13,House>Which some would argue is a little inappropriate,

911
00:50:41,430 --> 00:50:42,980
<4-13,House>那是他们不懂爱
<4-13,House>But they just don't know what love is.

912
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:44,130
<4-14,Lydia>您觉得呢
<4-14,Lydia>Am I right?

913
00:50:50,490 --> 00:50:51,450
<4-14,Lydia>你才不是同性恋
<4-14,Lydia>You're not gay.

914
00:50:51,990 --> 00:50:55,380
<4-15,House>当然不是  可我被逼跟别人分享小秘密
<4-15,House>No, but I have to tell intimate secrets to people.

915
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:58,270
<4-16,Lydia>也许你真该是同性恋
<4-16,Lydia>Maybe they should be true.

916
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:00,460
<4-17,House>我还真没想到这一点
<4-17,House>Hadn't thought of that.

917
00:51:00,830 --> 00:51:02,550
<4-17,House>安全起见  还是做双性恋吧
<4-17,House>To be on the safe side, I should probably do both,

918
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:04,410
<4-17,House>先玩好玩的
<4-17,House>Starting with the fun ones.

919
00:51:04,510 --> 00:51:06,310
<4-17,House>来吧  快乐升级
<4-17,House>Come on, let's get me better.

920
00:51:23,130 --> 00:51:24,550
<4-20,House>我是多情浪子
<4-20,House>I'm a philanderer.

921
00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:26,810
<4-21,Woman>是吗
<4-21,Woman>Oh.

922
00:51:27,450 --> 00:51:29,540
<4-22,House>四处留情并不意味着我是个慈善家
<4-22,House>Philanderer doesn't mean that I give a lot to charity.

923
00:51:29,650 --> 00:51:31,720
<4-23,Woman>-就是  -我知道是什么意思
<4-23,Woman>- It means... - I know what it means.

924
00:51:33,850 --> 00:51:35,850
<4-24,House>你刚才问我
<4-24,House>Uh, you were asking me

925
00:51:35,870 --> 00:51:37,640
<4-24,House>点心里有没有坚果
<4-24,House>If there were any nuts in the hors d'oeuvres.

926
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:38,640
<4-25,Woman>什么
<4-25,Woman>What?

927
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:40,470
<4-26,House>亲爱的
<4-26,House>Honey.

928
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:43,320
<4-27,Lydia>我丈夫刚才跟你说什么了
<4-27,Lydia>What did my husband just say to you?

929
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:47,830
<4-27,Lydia>我
<4-27,Lydia>I...

930
00:51:48,530 --> 00:51:51,820
<4-28,Woman>问他点心里
<4-28,Woman>Was asking him if there were nuts...

931
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:53,020
<4-28,Woman>有没有坚果
<4-28,Woman>In the hors d'oeuvres.

932
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:55,190
<4-29,Lydia>那你的肾上腺素呢[过敏药]
<4-29,Lydia>Then where is your epipen?

933
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:55,950
<4-30,Woman>什么
<4-30,Woman>My what?

934
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:58,570
<4-31,Lydia>有过敏史的人都应该带着的
<4-31,Lydia>No one with an allergy would walk around without an epipen.

935
00:51:59,110 --> 00:52:00,470
<4-33,Lydia>-钱包我看看  -不要
<4-33,Lydia>- Give me your purse. - No.

936
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:01,330
<4-33,Lydia>-把钱包给我  -停手
<4-33,Lydia>- Give me your purse. - Stop!

937
00:52:01,430 --> 00:52:02,250
<4-35,Lydia>-给我  -不要
<4-35,Lydia>- Come. - No.

938
00:52:02,390 --> 00:52:04,240
<4-36,Woman>到底怎么回事
<4-36,Woman>What really happened

939
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:06,170
<4-36,Woman>是
<4-36,Woman>Is...

940
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:08,910
<4-36,Woman>我是觉得他挺帅的
<4-36,Woman>I thought he was cute.

941
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:10,620
<4-36,Woman>对他有点意思
<4-36,Woman>I hit on him.

942
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:11,850
<4-37,Lydia>咱们走
<4-37,Lydia>We're going.

943
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:21,120
<5-1,Nolan>玩得怎么样
<5-1,Nolan>You having fun?

944
00:52:23,470 --> 00:52:24,930
<5-2,House>我确实和一个人很亲密
<5-2,House>I did connect with one guy.

945
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:29,220
<5-2,House>但我的顽劣本性占了上风
<5-2,House>But then my propensity for screwing things up overtook me.

946
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:33,520
<5-2,House>然后我爱玩的欲望又打败我的本性
<5-2,House>Then my desire to have fun overcame my propensity.

947
00:52:33,910 --> 00:52:34,930
<5-2,House>你没搞砸啊
<5-2,House>You didn't screw it up.

948
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:37,680
<5-3,Nolan>来这里不是让你真心真意地
<5-3,Nolan>The assignment wasn't to get you to trust people

949
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:38,890
<5-3,Nolan>去相信这里的人
<5-3,Nolan>With a piece of your soul.

950
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:42,280
<5-3,Nolan>而是让你知道你可以信任别人
<5-3,Nolan>The assignment was to teach you that you can trust.

951
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,410
<5-3,Nolan>在座的这些人有出卖你吗
<5-3,Nolan>Did any of these people rat you out

952
00:52:45,510 --> 00:52:47,320
<5-3,Nolan>因为把你当作好色鬼
<5-3,Nolan>As the obnoxious womanizer

953
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:49,830
<5-3,Nolan>还是什么情色小说家
<5-3,Nolan>Or the porn producer that they think you are?

954
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:52,990
<5-3,Nolan>你为什么觉得
<5-3,Nolan>Why do you think

955
00:52:53,050 --> 00:52:56,300
<5-3,Nolan>如果别人知道真相就会不好好待你呢
<5-3,Nolan>That people would treat you worse if they knew the truth?

956
00:53:01,350 --> 00:53:02,410
<5-4,Lydia>晚上好  医生
<5-4,Lydia>Good night, doctor.

957
00:53:06,890 --> 00:53:07,850
<5-4,Lydia>你闯祸了吗
<5-4,Lydia>Are you in trouble?

958
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:11,820
<5-5,House>当然没有
<5-5,House>Apparently not.

959
00:53:12,570 --> 00:53:13,740
<5-6,Lydia>那下一步呢
<5-6,Lydia>So what's next?

960
00:53:14,590 --> 00:53:15,530
<5-6,Lydia>想当皮条客吗
<5-6,Lydia>You want to be my pimp?

961
00:53:19,690 --> 00:53:20,580
<5-7,House>我们聊天好吗
<5-7,House>Why don't we just talk?

962
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:23,670
<5-8,Lydia>好吧
<5-8,Lydia>Okay.

963
00:53:26,410 --> 00:53:29,020
<5-9,House>你怎么不气我偷你的车
<5-9,House>How come you weren't pissed at me for stealing your car?

964
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:32,520
<5-10,Lydia>因为你在做好事
<5-10,Lydia>It was a nice thing to do.

965
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:34,800
<5-10,Lydia>我自己都不确定
<5-10,Lydia>I'm not sure

966
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:36,850
<5-11,House>在德语中"好事"到底是指什么
<5-11,House>About the German-English translation of nice.

967
00:53:37,210 --> 00:53:38,660
<5-11,House>你说偷车是好事  还是
<5-11,House>You mean the stealing was nice or...

968
00:53:40,330 --> 00:53:42,290
<5-11,House>还是毁了自由战士的一生是好事呢
<5-11,House>Ruining Freedom Master's life?

969
00:53:43,430 --> 00:53:45,440
<5-12,Lydia>你所做的并非本意
<5-12,Lydia>What you did was misguided

970
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:47,690
<5-9,House>而且不负责任
<5-9,House>And irresponsible,

971
00:53:48,730 --> 00:53:50,120
<5-10,Lydia>但还是好的
<5-10,Lydia>But it was also nice.

972
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:53,540
<5-12,Lydia>你给了他享受到真正的幸福
<5-12,Lydia>You gave him a moment of pure happiness.

973
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:00,380
<5-12,Lydia>你问我为什么经常来看安妮
<5-12,Lydia>You asked me why I come here so often to visit Annie.

974
00:54:02,370 --> 00:54:03,770
<5-12,Lydia>她曾是我最好的朋友
<5-12,Lydia>She was my best friend.

975
00:54:04,990 --> 00:54:09,210
<5-12,Lydia>然后她开始将所有人都拒之门外
<5-12,Lydia>Then she started pulling away...from everybody.

976
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:11,610
<5-12,Lydia>医生不知道为什么
<5-12,Lydia>The doctors don't know why.

977
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:14,360
<5-12,Lydia>我觉得
<5-12,Lydia>I think

978
00:54:14,470 --> 00:54:17,010
<5-12,Lydia>嫁给她哥哥是因为
<5-12,Lydia>I married her brother because...

979
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:19,390
<5-12,Lydia>他是唯一一个
<5-12,Lydia>He was the only other one

980
00:54:19,410 --> 00:54:21,560
<5-12,Lydia>与我感同身受的人
<5-12,Lydia>Who was going through the same thing.

981
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:26,830
<5-12,Lydia>可他从几年前开始就不再来看她
<5-12,Lydia>But he stopped visiting after a couple of years.

982
00:54:28,580 --> 00:54:30,050
<5-12,Lydia>我就是
<5-12,Lydia>I just...

983
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:31,180
<5-12,Lydia>停不下来
<5-12,Lydia>Couldn't stop.

984
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:35,270
<5-12,Lydia>我想她
<5-12,Lydia>I miss her.

985
00:54:44,450 --> 00:54:45,580
<5-12,Lydia>我该走了
<5-12,Lydia>I should go.

986
00:54:48,450 --> 00:54:49,230
<5-13,House>晚安
<5-13,House>Good night.

987
00:55:02,130 --> 00:55:02,930
<5-13,House>晚安
<5-13,House>Good night.

988
00:55:23,830 --> 00:55:24,680
<6-1,Alvie>发生了什么事
<6-1,Alvie>So what happened?

989
00:55:26,670 --> 00:55:28,410
<6-2,House>-你愿意理我啦  -才没
<6-2,House>- You're talking to me now. - No.

990
00:55:36,410 --> 00:55:37,220
<6-4,Alvie>好玩吗
<6-4,Alvie>Was it fun?

991
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:41,390
<6-5,House>好玩
<6-5,House>Yeah

992
00:55:50,690 --> 00:55:51,540
<7-1,House>她吻我了
<7-1,House>She kissed me.

993
00:55:53,010 --> 00:55:54,500
<7-1,House>不是打比方
<7-1,House>Don't read into the phrasing.

994
00:55:55,170 --> 00:55:56,870
<7-1,House>我们的确接吻了
<7-1,House>We kissed each other.

995
00:55:57,370 --> 00:55:58,530
<7-2,Nolan>你觉得如何
<7-2,Nolan>And how do you feel about that?

996
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,520
<7-3,House>我觉得如何  就是个吻而已
<7-3,House>How do I feel about that? It was a kiss.

997
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:02,150
<7-3,House>亲吻总是好事
<7-3,House>Kisses are good things.

998
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:03,980
<7-4,Nolan>好的
<7-4,Nolan>Okay.

999
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:07,750
<7-5,House>你这话有些弦外之音啊
<7-5,House>That was a loaded "okay."

1000
00:56:08,110 --> 00:56:09,720
<7-6,Nolan>完全没有  你为什么这么说
<7-6,Nolan>Not at all. Why would you assume that?

1001
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:11,480
<7-6,Nolan>因为你审判我了
<7-6,Nolan>Cause you're being judgmental.

1002
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:15,850
<7-7,House>如果我说  我昨晚上的智利鲈鱼非常好吃
<7-7,House>If I had said that I'd had some delicious chilean sea bass for dinner last night,

1003
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:17,630
<7-7,House>你会说  你有何感觉吗
<7-7,House>Would you say, "and how do you feel about that?"

1004
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:19,350
<7-8,Nolan>如果入锅是鲈鱼有夫之妇  我可能会问
<7-8,Nolan>If the sea bass was married, I might.

1005
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:21,920
<7-9,House>看吧  你开始说三道四了
<7-9,House>See, you're being judgmental.

1006
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:25,250
<7-9,House>是不是违反了你的什么原则
<7-9,House>Isn't that against your code or something?

1007
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:26,650
<7-10,Nolan>我只是陈述事实而已
<7-10,Nolan>I'm simply stating the obvious.

1008
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:27,840
<7-10,Nolan>事情很复杂
<7-10,Nolan>It's complicated,

1009
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:29,420
<7-10,Nolan>不仅是因为她是有夫之妇
<7-10,Nolan>Not just because she's married

1010
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:31,780
<7-10,Nolan>也不仅是因为你被关在精神病院
<7-10,Nolan>And not just because you're institutionalized.

1011
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:33,730
<7-10,Nolan>你已经花了十二个小时
<7-10,Nolan>I know you spent the last 12 hours

1012
00:56:33,830 --> 00:56:35,300
<7-10,Nolan>想要弄明白那个吻的意义
<7-10,Nolan>Trying to figure out what that kiss means.

1013
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:41,450
<7-11,House>那天停车场的那个女人是谁
<7-11,House>Who's that woman you were with in the parking lot?

1014
00:56:42,330 --> 00:56:43,320
<7-12,Nolan>你转移话题时
<7-12,Nolan>When you deflect,

1015
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:45,750
<7-12,Nolan>比你坦言时更能表达自己的感受
<7-12,Nolan>It's more effective when you're not that transparent.

1016
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:48,380
<7-13,House>出轨对你而言再平常不过
<7-13,House>Obviously you have no problem with the infidelity.

1017
00:56:48,450 --> 00:56:50,320
<7-14,Nolan>你只是在给自己辩护
<7-14,Nolan>You're trying to rationalize that,

1018
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:52,480
<7-14,Nolan>如果你这医生可以这样  我也可以
<7-14,Nolan>"If it's okay for your doctor, it's okay."

1019
00:56:52,970 --> 00:56:54,150
<7-14,Nolan>但事先声明
<7-14,Nolan>But just for the record,

1020
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:56,350
<7-15,House>-我没有婚外恋  -那她是谁
<7-15,House>- I am not having an affair. - Then who is she?

1021
00:56:56,420 --> 00:56:57,600
<7-16,Nolan>什么让如此费尽心机地
<7-16,Nolan>Why do you think you're working so hard

1022
00:56:57,700 --> 00:56:59,270
<7-16,Nolan>挖掘我的私生活
<7-16,Nolan>To figure out the details of my personal life?

1023
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:00,610
<7-17,House>我也许大可不必大费周章
<7-17,House>I might not have to work so hard

1024
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:02,170
<7-17,House>如果这里的人还有隐私可以的话
<7-17,House>If there were some personal items in here.

1025
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:04,170
<7-17,House>你只有一个速拨号码
<7-17,House>You got one number on speed dial.

1026
00:57:04,390 --> 00:57:05,420
<7-17,House>名称是"爸爸"
<7-17,House>It says "dad."

1027
00:57:06,150 --> 00:57:07,610
<7-17,House>拜托  你都多大了
<7-17,House>Come on, how old are you?

1028
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:09,300
<7-18,Nolan>为什么你害怕提及这个话题
<7-18,Nolan>Why are you so afraid to talk about this?

1029
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:10,440
<7-19,House>我只想说说你
<7-19,House>I want to talk about you.

1030
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:12,170
<7-19,House>我想知道是谁在给我忠告
<7-19,House>I want to know who I'm taking advice from.

1031
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:14,130
<7-20,Nolan>我并没有给你忠告  我只是在问你问题
<7-20,Nolan>I'm not giving you advice. I'm asking you questions.

1032
00:57:14,310 --> 00:57:15,910
<7-20,Nolan>那一吻意味深长
<7-20,Nolan>I think that kiss meant a lot.

1033
00:57:15,970 --> 00:57:17,110
<7-20,Nolan>这一吻让你害怕了
<7-20,Nolan>I think that scares you.

1034
00:57:17,170 --> 00:57:19,370
<7-21,House>我没有掺杂私人因素
<7-21,House>I think there are no personal items in here

1035
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:21,170
<7-21,House>因为你压根就没有私生活
<7-21,House>Because you have no personal life.

1036
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:22,850
<7-22,Nolan>你觉得你和利迪娅结局会如何
<7-22,Nolan>How do you think you and Lydia will end?

1037
00:57:23,090 --> 00:57:24,510
<7-23,House>你这个寂寞的老男人
<7-23,House>You are a lonely man.

1038
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:27,340
<7-23,House>你错过生命中所有的姻缘
<7-23,House>You've screwed up every opportunity you've had in life.

1039
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:28,910
<7-24,Nolan>你们会如何结束呢
<7-24,Nolan>What's the ending to the story?

1040
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:35,500
<7-24,Nolan>我不知道
<7-24,Nolan>I don't know.

1041
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:41,340
<8-1,Orderly>探访时间
<8-1,Orderly>Visiting time!

1042
00:58:01,290 --> 00:58:02,560
<8-2,House>你为什么亲我呢
<8-2,House>Why did you kiss me?

1043
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:09,400
<8-3,Lydia>要有多少个理由呢
<8-3,Lydia>How many reasons are there?

1044
00:58:10,850 --> 00:58:11,940
<8-3,Lydia>我喜欢你
<8-3,Lydia>I like you.

1045
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:14,960
<8-3,Lydia>我觉得这是个示爱的好方式
<8-3,Lydia>It felt like a nice way of showing you that.

1046
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:29,100
<8-3,Lydia>"童年情景"  苏珊娜
<8-3,Lydia>"Kinderszenen" opus. 15 -- Susanna

1047
00:58:38,970 --> 00:58:40,990
<8-4,Safer>把门扶好
<8-4,Safer>Open it all the way. Keep it open.

1048
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:05,960
<8-4,Safer>跟利迪娅怎样了
<8-4,Safer>How'd it go with Lydia?

1049
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:08,920
<9-1,Nolan>我俩会一直快活逍遥
<9-1,Nolan>I found out you can only be happy so long

1050
00:59:08,990 --> 00:59:12,850
<9-2,House>直到那个断腿的疯子被人从电梯推出来
<9-2,House>Before the catatonic guy with two broken limbs rolls off the elevator,

1051
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:14,980
<9-2,House>打比方而已
<9-2,House>Philosophically speaking.

1052
00:59:15,750 --> 00:59:18,250
<9-3,Nolan>为什么你的眼里就只有失败呢
<9-3,Nolan>Why do you value your failures more than your successes?

1053
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:22,390
<9-4,House>我对着外婆照片手淫时被我妈逮个正着
<9-4,House>My mother caught me masturbating to pictures of her mother

1054
00:59:22,450 --> 00:59:24,330
<9-5,Nolan>我们能不能别再玩这些隐喻了
<9-5,Nolan>Can we get past these cute deflections?

1055
00:59:26,150 --> 00:59:28,720
<9-6,House>无论多成功  半路总会杀出个程咬金
<9-6,House>Successes only last until someone screws them up.

1056
00:59:28,830 --> 00:59:30,070
<9-6,House>失败是永远的
<9-6,House>Failures are forever.

1057
00:59:30,450 --> 00:59:31,800
<9-7,Nolan>于是你接受事实
<9-7,Nolan>So you accept that fact.

1058
00:59:33,410 --> 00:59:34,870
<9-7,Nolan>如果接受事实  你无能为力
<9-7,Nolan>You accept that there's nothing you can do.

1059
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:38,220
<9-8,House>行  我接受事实  我无能为力
<9-8,House>Okay, I accept the fact that there's nothing I can do.

1060
00:59:38,290 --> 00:59:39,770
<9-8,House>现在要我怎么办
<9-8,House>Now, what can I do?

1061
00:59:40,090 --> 00:59:42,370
<9-9,Nolan>承认自己的失败
<9-9,Nolan>You acknowledge failure,

1062
00:59:43,270 --> 00:59:44,390
<9-9,Nolan>向前看
<9-9,Nolan>And you move past it.

1063
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:45,790
<9-9,Nolan>去道歉
<9-9,Nolan>You apologize.

1064
00:59:48,630 --> 00:59:50,490
<9-10,House>道歉是多么强大有力的东西
<9-10,House>Powerful things these apologies.

1065
00:59:51,650 --> 00:59:53,650
<9-10,House>让一个人激动的跳楼
<9-10,House>Get someone to jump off a building.

1066
00:59:54,050 --> 00:59:56,230
<9-10,House>然后跟他说对不起  就继续过自己的日子
<9-10,House>You say two words, and you move on with your life.

1067
00:59:56,780 --> 00:59:58,270
<9-10,House>真是公平合理
<9-10,House>Hardly seems fair.

1068
00:59:58,940 --> 00:59:59,770
<9-11,Nolan>这就是症结所在吗
<9-11,Nolan>Is that the issue?

1069
01:00:03,510 --> 01:00:05,390
<9-11,Nolan>你让他痛苦
<9-11,Nolan>You caused him pain.

1070
01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:11,370
<9-11,Nolan>如果世界是公正的  你会忍受同样的痛苦吗
<9-11,Nolan>If the world is just, you have to suffer equally?

1071
01:00:15,710 --> 01:00:16,870
<9-11,Nolan>你不是上帝  豪斯
<9-11,Nolan>You're not god, House.

1072
01:00:17,820 --> 01:00:20,380
<9-11,Nolan>你只是做错事
<9-11,Nolan>You're just another screwed-up human being

1073
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:22,100
<9-11,Nolan>而需要继续前进的人
<9-11,Nolan>Who needs to move on.

1074
01:00:24,310 --> 01:00:25,310
<9-11,Nolan>向他道歉
<9-11,Nolan>Apologize to him.

1075
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:27,940
<9-11,Nolan>让你自己感觉好点
<9-11,Nolan>Let yourself feel better.

1076
01:00:28,610 --> 01:00:30,320
<9-11,Nolan>然后你就能学会让自己
<9-11,Nolan>Then you can learn to let yourself...

1077
01:00:31,890 --> 01:00:34,190
<9-11,Nolan>一直感觉良好
<9-11,Nolan>Keep feeling better.

1078
01:01:00,130 --> 01:01:00,760
<10-1,House>嗨
<10-1,House>Hey.

1079
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:16,930
<10-2,Beasley>豪斯医生  还好吧
<10-2,Beasley>Dr. House, everything okay?

1080
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:19,700
<10-3,House>是的
<10-3,House>Yeah.

1081
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:21,680
<10-4,Beasley>集体活动时间
<10-4,Beasley>Time for group.

1082
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:24,270
<10-4,Beasley>集体活动时间到了
<10-4,Beasley>Group time, everybody!

1083
01:01:28,530 --> 01:01:30,070

<10-4,Beasley>I have a surprise.

1084
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:31,390
<10-4,Beasley>两个星期后的今天
<10-4,Beasley>Two weeks from today,

1085
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:34,010
<11-1,Beasley>我们会举办梅菲尔德才艺表演
<11-1,Beasley>We're going to have the Mayfield talent show.

1086
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:37,130
<11-2,Richter>才艺表演  谁要参加
<11-2,Richter>Talent show? Who's in it?

1087
01:01:37,370 --> 01:01:39,900
<11-3,Beasley>我非常希望大家都参与
<11-3,Beasley>I'd really love it if everybody here could participate.

1088
01:01:40,310 --> 01:01:41,580
<11-4,Richter>那么谁来当观众
<11-4,Richter>Then who's gonna watch?

1089
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:43,400
<11-5,Beasley>工作人员会来
<11-5,Beasley>The staff will come,

01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:46,360
<11-6,Richter>你会录下来吗
<11-6,Richter>You gonna tape this?

1092
01:01:46,550 --> 01:01:47,880
<11-7,Beasley>不会  这是属于我们的
<11-7,Beasley>No, it's just for us.

1093
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,030
<11-8,Richter>如果只是我们自娱自乐  我反对
<11-8,Richter>Well, if it's just for us, I vote we don't do it.

1094
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:55,300
<11-9,Beasley>把它当作我们的快乐治疗法吧
<11-9,Beasley>Think of it as a fun way to work on on our therapeutic issues.

1095
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:57,660
<11-9,Beasley>阿瓦  也许你可以唱首你的歌
<11-9,Beasley>Alvie, maybe you could sing one of your songs.

1096
01:01:57,730 --> 01:01:59,690
<11-10,Alvie>我不唱歌  我只说唱
<11-10,Alvie>I don't sing. I rap.

1097
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:01,960
<11-11,Beasley>那好吧  你可以写点关于我们的东西
<11-11,Beasley>Okay, well, you can write something just for us.

1098
01:02:02,210 --> 01:02:05,360
<11-12,Alvie>我不写  我只会即兴创作
<11-12,Alvie>I don't write. I just do, freestyle style.

1099
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:08,750
<11-13,Beasley>我觉得你已经蠢蠢欲动了
<11-13,Beasley>I think you're gonna want to be prepared.

1100
01:02:09,250 --> 01:02:10,260
<11-14,Alvie>-给我们带来不同寻常的秀吧  -我生来就不同寻常
<11-14,Alvie>- Make something special. - Always special.

1101
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:11,520
<11-15,Beasley>你呢  黛安
<11-15,Beasley>How about you, Diane?

1102
01:02:11,590 --> 01:02:12,960
<11-15,Beasley>你有什么想要表演的吗
<11-15,Beasley>Is there something you'd like to do?

1103
01:02:14,350 --> 01:02:15,730
<11-16,Diane>我一点天赋都没有
<11-16,Diane>I don't have any talents.

1104
01:02:16,110 --> 01:02:17,190
<11-17,Beasley>你当然有
<11-17,Beasley>Sure you do.

1105
01:02:17,570 --> 01:02:18,800
<11-17,Beasley>你们都有
<11-17,Beasley>You all do.

1106
01:02:19,660 --> 01:02:21,760
<11-17,Beasley>史蒂夫  你觉得黛安是不是有
<11-17,Beasley>Steve, don't you think that Diane has hidden talent

1107
01:02:21,860 --> 01:02:23,390
<11-17,Beasley>潜在的天分没被挖掘呢
<11-17,Beasley>That we'd all like to see come out?

1108
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:27,660
<11-18,House>你真的觉得他会答应吗
<11-18,House>You really think he's gonna answer?

1109
01:02:27,930 --> 01:02:28,840
<11-19,Beasley>终究会的
<11-19,Beasley>Eventually.

1110
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:29,760
<11-20,House>为什么
<11-20,House>Why?

1111
01:02:31,530 --> 01:02:32,760
<11-21,Beasley>因为事情会过去的
<11-21,Beasley>Because things pass.

1112
01:02:33,090 --> 01:02:33,890
<11-22,House>事过境迁
<11-22,House>Things change.

1113
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:35,170
<11-22,House>不意味着他们会好起来
<11-22,House>It doesn't mean they get better.

1114
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:37,220
<11-22,House>你要努力让事情好起来
<11-22,House>You got to make things better.

1115
01:02:37,290 --> 01:02:39,410
<11-22,House>单凭一张嘴不能改变什么
<11-22,House>You can't just keep talking and hope for the best.

1116
01:02:42,910 --> 01:02:45,760
<11-23,Beasley>黛安  你可以和我一起表演
<11-23,Beasley>Diane, maybe you and I can work together and figure something out.

1117
01:02:47,580 --> 01:02:48,880
<11-24,House>我可以救他
<11-24,House>I can save him.

1118
01:02:50,550 --> 01:02:53,060
<11-24,House>"他们偷走了她音乐盒"  他之前是这么说的
<11-24,House>"They stole her voice box"  that's what he said.

1119
01:02:53,310 --> 01:02:54,630
<11-24,House>那是她盯着看的东西
<11-24,House>That's what she was staring at.

1120
01:02:55,610 --> 01:02:56,880
<11-24,House>那是她盯着看的原因
<11-24,House>That's why he's staring.

1121
01:02:56,950 --> 01:02:58,010
<11-25,Beasley>豪斯医生  求你了
<11-25,Beasley>Dr. House, please.

1122
01:02:58,470 --> 01:02:59,950
<11-26,House>因为那有个音乐盒
<11-26,House>Cause there's a music box in there.

1123
01:03:00,010 --> 01:03:00,880
<11-27,Beasley>保安
<11-27,Beasley>Orderly.

1124
01:03:03,620 --> 01:03:05,000
<11-28,House>把它给我  我可以
<11-28,House>Come on, just give it to me. I can

1125
01:03:05,210 --> 01:03:08,310
<11-28,House>我不是在发神经
<11-28,House>I am not having a psychotic break.

1126
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:10,450
<11-28,House>我保证会管用的
<11-28,House>I promise you this will work.

1127
01:03:19,350 --> 01:03:21,410
<11-29,House>架子顶上那个蓝盒子
<11-29,House>It's the blue box there on the top shelf.

1128
01:03:25,030 --> 01:03:26,190
<11-29,House>这就是你想要的
<11-29,House>This is what you wanted.

1129
01:03:26,950 --> 01:03:29,240
<11-29,House>这就是你要的音乐
<11-29,House>This is what you needed  a voice.

1130
01:03:30,350 --> 01:03:32,410
<11-29,House>你以为自己能用拯救那个不说话的女孩
<11-29,House>You thought you could cure silent girl with this.

1131
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:34,500
<11-29,House>按照你的理论  也能拯救你
<11-29,House>So by your own rationale, it should cure you.

1132
01:03:37,060 --> 01:03:38,300
<11-29,House>你没有任何问题
<11-29,House>There's nothing wrong with you.

1133
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:41,650
<11-29,House>你的所有机能都在复原
<11-29,House>You're healing. All the parts work.

1134
01:03:41,830 --> 01:03:42,680
<11-29,House>说话啊
<11-29,House>Just speak.

1135
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:46,310
<11-29,House>快点  说话  开口说话啊
<11-29,House>Come on, speak! Say something!

1136
01:03:46,380 --> 01:03:48,300
<11-30,Nolan>还是休息一会吧
<11-30,Nolan>I think maybe everyone should take a break now.

1137
01:03:57,640 --> 01:04:00,780
<11-31,Nolan>你是在补救  而非克服它
<11-31,Nolan>You're trying to fix instead of moving on

1138
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:23,860
<12-1,Lydia>我带来德沃夏克的曲谱
<12-1,Lydia>I brought dvorak

1139
01:04:24,570 --> 01:04:25,760
<12-1,Lydia>四手联弹
<12-1,Lydia>Four hands.

1140
01:04:28,860 --> 01:04:29,500
<12-1,Lydia>怎么了
<12-1,Lydia>What?

1141
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,310
<12-2,House>我要知道这是什么
<12-2,House>I need to know what this is.

1142
01:04:34,630 --> 01:04:35,570
<12-3,Lydia>这是乐谱
<12-3,Lydia>It's sheet music.

1143
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:42,420
<12-3,Lydia>我跟你说过  这只是
<12-3,Lydia>I told you. It's just...

1144
01:04:43,350 --> 01:04:44,910
<12-3,Lydia>两人之间的快乐
<12-3,Lydia>Two people having fun.

1145
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:48,250
<12-4,House>一般会有两种结果
<12-4,House>There's two possible outcomes.

1146
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:50,080
<12-4,House>要么是结束了  有人受伤
<12-4,House>It ends. Someone gets hurt.

1147
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:52,570
<12-4,House>要么是不了了之  还是有人受伤
<12-4,House>Or it doesn't end. Someone gets hurt.

1148
01:04:53,470 --> 01:04:54,930
<12-5,Lydia>结果虽然很苦
<12-5,Lydia>So the end sucks.

1149
01:04:55,020 --> 01:04:56,990
<12-5,Lydia>但那不意味着开始也很苦
<12-5,Lydia>It doesn't mean the beginning has to.

1150
01:04:58,630 --> 01:05:00,830
<12-5,Lydia>万事皆有终结  生命也有尽头
<12-5,Lydia>Everything ends. Life ends.

1151
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:03,150
<12-5,Lydia>可那并不意味着我们不能享受生活
<12-5,Lydia>It it doesn't mean that we can't enjoy it.

1152
01:05:04,940 --> 01:05:06,710
<12-6,House>我做不到
<12-6,House>I can't, I can't do this.

1153
01:05:09,020 --> 01:05:11,670
<12-7,Lydia>我只知道  五分钟之前我很开心
<12-7,Lydia>All I know is, I was happy five minutes ago,

1154
01:05:12,090 --> 01:05:13,020
<12-7,Lydia>现在我不是
<12-7,Lydia>And now I'm not.

1155
01:05:14,380 --> 01:05:15,400
<12-7,Lydia>这又有何好处呢
<12-7,Lydia>How's that better?

1156
01:05:17,610 --> 01:05:18,480
<12-8,House>再见了  利迪娅
<12-8,House>Good-bye, Lydia.

1157
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:28,630
<13-1,Diane>我真的很担心电惊厥疗法
<13-1,Diane>I'm really worried about E.C.T.

1158
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:30,850
<13-2,Beasley>担心是正常的
<13-2,Beasley>Apprehension's normal.

1159
01:05:31,330 --> 01:05:32,540
<13-2,Beasley>还有别人有相同的感觉吗
<13-2,Beasley>Has anyone else had it?

1160
01:05:32,810 --> 01:05:33,920
<13-3,Alvie>他们电过我
<13-3,Alvie>They shocked me, man.

1161
01:05:35,990 --> 01:05:38,130
<13-4,Diane>谢谢  真是很宽慰
<13-4,Diane>Thanks. That's very reassuring.

1162
01:05:39,130 --> 01:05:40,340
<13-4,Diane>我不知道我该不该做
<13-4,Diane>I don't know if I should do it.

1163
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:42,600
<13-5,House>要么接受治疗  要么就给我闭嘴
<13-5,House>Oh, just do the treatment or shut up.

1164
01:05:43,210 --> 01:05:44,550
<13-6,Beasley>格雷戈  这是个必经的过程
<13-6,Beasley>Greg, there's a process.

1165
01:05:44,650 --> 01:05:45,890
<13-7,House>那是  一过程
<13-7,House>Yes, a process.

1166
01:05:46,010 --> 01:05:48,290
<13-7,House>不想让别人预知结果而影响过程
<13-7,House>Wouldn't want to disrupt the process with results.

1167
01:05:48,490 --> 01:05:50,090
<13-8,Alvie>西斯昨晚睡得不好
<13-8,Alvie>Heezy had a rough night last night.

1168
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:52,060
<13-8,Alvie>我猜他想做回混蛋
<13-8,Alvie>Guess he decided to go back to being an ass

1169
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:52,990
<13-8,Alvie>而不是伪君子了
<13-8,Alvie>Instead of a hypocrite.

1170
01:05:53,210 --> 01:05:54,470
<13-9,Beasley>我们继续
<13-9,Beasley>let's move on.

1171
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:57,680
<13-9,Beasley>阿瓦  你的说唱词写到哪里了呢
<13-9,Beasley>Alvie, are you making any progress writing your rap?

1172
01:05:57,990 --> 01:05:58,520
<13-9,Beasley>有写
<13-9,Beasley>Yeah.

1173
01:05:59,250 --> 01:06:00,350
<13-10,Alvie>其实  没有
<13-10,Alvie>But really, no.

1174
01:06:00,550 --> 01:06:02,300
<13-10,Alvie>我只是不想把我的歌写下来
<13-10,Alvie>I just don't want to write my songs down.

1175
01:06:02,310 --> 01:06:03,860
<13-10,Alvie>它们都是即兴创作的
<13-10,Alvie>It takes all the spontaneity out of it.

1176
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:06,250
<13-10,Alvie>不是任何时候的感受
<13-10,Alvie>It's not of the moment.

1177
01:06:06,250 --> 01:06:08,070
<13-11,Beasley>阿瓦  你要是把词写下来
<13-11,Beasley>Alvie, if you write things down

1178
01:06:08,090 --> 01:06:10,120
<13-12,Alvie>当时机来临  轮到我出手
<13-12,Alvie>When the time comes my run comes

1179
01:06:10,380 --> 01:06:12,190
<13-12,Alvie>当我光芒四射
<13-12,Alvie>When my spotlight shines

1180
01:06:13,700 --> 01:06:15,080
<13-13,House>没错  你真是个天才
<13-13,House>Yeah, you're a genius.

1181
01:06:15,750 --> 01:06:16,880
<13-13,House>用"阴茎"来押韵
<13-13,House>Rhymes with "penius."

1182
01:06:17,130 --> 01:06:18,930
<13-14,Medina>抱歉打扰了  比斯利医生
<13-14,Medina>Sorry to interrupt, Dr. Beasley.

1183
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:21,590
<13-14,Medina>诺兰医生让我给你这个
<13-14,Medina>Dr. Nolan asked me to give you this.

1184
01:06:26,630 --> 01:06:27,940
<13-15,House>一日外出的许可证
<13-15,House>Is this a day pass?

1185
01:06:28,100 --> 01:06:28,930
<13-16,Medina>他想见你
<13-16,Medina>He'd like to see you.

1186
01:06:49,530 --> 01:06:50,340
<14-1,Nolan>谢谢你能来
<14-1,Nolan>Thanks for coming.

1187
01:06:51,420 --> 01:06:53,790
<14-1,Nolan>我希望你能看一下我父亲的病例
<14-1,Nolan>I was hoping you could, uh, take a look at my dad's chart.

1188
01:06:55,570 --> 01:06:56,390
<14-2,House>咨询我吗
<14-2,House>A consult?

1189
01:06:57,400 --> 01:06:58,140
<14-2,House>怎么了
<14-2,House>What happened

1190
01:06:58,250 --> 01:07:00,340
<14-2,House>镇上所有神智正常的医生看遍了吗
<14-2,House>You went through every sane doctor in town?

1191
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:02,770
<14-3,Nolan>我想你应该很想出来走走
<14-3,Nolan>I thought you wouldn't mind getting off the ward.

1192
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:09,300
<14-3,Nolan>清洁工是在厨房地板上发现他
<14-3,Nolan>Cleaning lady found him on the kitchen floor.

1193
01:07:10,270 --> 01:07:12,100
<14-3,Nolan>这里的医生认为他不行了
<14-3,Nolan>Doctors here don't think that he'll recover,

1194
01:07:12,420 --> 01:07:13,490
<14-3,Nolan>认为我应该放弃
<14-3,Nolan>That I should pull the plug.

1195
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:15,930
<14-3,Nolan>我想要补充意见  所以我
<14-3,Nolan>I want a second opinion, so I

1196
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:18,130
<14-3,Nolan>我想如果不请教你就太浪费了
<14-3,Nolan>I thought I'd be a fool not to call you.

1197
01:07:22,330 --> 01:07:23,570
<14-4,House>腔隙性梗塞
<14-4,House>Lacunar infarct,

1198
01:07:24,010 --> 01:07:25,650
<14-4,House>转为出血性中风
<14-4,House>Converted to hemorrhagic stroke.

1199
01:07:26,730 --> 01:07:28,290
<14-4,House>挤压着他的大脑
<14-4,House>It squashed his brain.

1200
01:07:29,430 --> 01:07:30,420
<14-4,House>他们没遗漏什么
<14-4,House>They didn't miss anything.

1201
01:07:32,260 --> 01:07:33,160
<14-5,Nolan>跟我想的一样
<14-5,Nolan>That's what I thought.

1202
01:07:33,390 --> 01:07:34,500
<14-6,House>跟你知道的一样
<14-6,House>That's what you knew.

1203
01:07:36,740 --> 01:07:38,800
<14-6,House>他的大脑中积满血液
<14-6,House>His brain has been replaced by blood.

1204
01:07:39,550 --> 01:07:40,280
<14-6,House>没救了
<14-6,House>It's over.

1205
01:07:41,130 --> 01:07:42,790
<14-6,House>任何看过片子的医生会做此结论
<14-6,House>And that's obvious to any doctor

1206
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:44,220
<14-6,House>甚至连精神科医生也会
<14-6,House>Who looks at that scan, even a shrink.

1207
01:07:45,130 --> 01:07:46,170
<14-6,House>你只是想让你点醒你
<14-6,House>You want someone to tell you

1208
01:07:46,230 --> 01:07:47,660
<14-6,House>告诉你放弃治疗是明智之举
<14-6,House>That what you need to do is okay,

1209
01:07:47,830 --> 01:07:49,620
<14-6,House>让别人认可你  赦免你
<14-6,House>To give you permission, absolution.

1210
01:07:50,510 --> 01:07:51,610
<14-7,Nolan>现在不是时候  豪斯
<14-7,Nolan>Not now, House.

1211
01:07:53,340 --> 01:07:55,330
<14-8,House>你没有朋友  没有家人
<14-8,House>You have no friends, no family.

1212
01:07:56,030 --> 01:07:57,130
<14-8,House>在什么时候
<14-8,House>At some point,

1213
01:07:57,960 --> 01:07:59,010
<14-8,House>你犯了错
<14-8,House>You made a mistake.

1214
01:07:59,130 --> 01:08:00,320
<14-8,House>失去了一切
<14-8,House>You lost everything.

1215
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:04,530
<14-8,House>此刻正好可以用上我这家伙
<14-8,House>And now I'm the closest thing you got to a friend.

1216
01:08:05,290 --> 01:08:06,100
<14-9,Nolan>别说了
<14-9,Nolan>Just shut up.

1217
01:08:08,660 --> 01:08:11,910
<14-9,Nolan>我不需要你来对我冷嘲热讽
<14-9,Nolan>I don't need you here to play this game.

1218
01:09:04,130 --> 01:09:05,660
<15-1,House>很抱歉拒你于千里之外
<15-1,House>I'm sorry I pushed you away.

1219
01:09:07,630 --> 01:09:09,090
<15-1,House>我害怕的时候就会这样
<15-1,House>It's what I do when I'm afraid.

1220
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:14,350
<15-1,House>重申  德译英或许意思会有偏差
<15-1,House>Again, German-English translation may be a little off.

1221
01:09:17,780 --> 01:09:20,770
<15-2,Lydia>我不是为你而哭
<15-2,Lydia>I'm not I'm not crying because of you.

1222
01:09:21,820 --> 01:09:25,010
<15-2,Lydia>我哭是因为我可悲
<15-2,Lydia>I'm crying because I'm pathetic.

1223
01:09:26,700 --> 01:09:27,990
<15-2,Lydia>我给她带来大提琴
<15-2,Lydia>I brought her cello,

1224
01:09:28,410 --> 01:09:30,720
<15-2,Lydia>为了她能奇迹般苏醒继续上台演出
<15-2,Lydia>In case she magically wakes up for the show.

1225
01:09:32,420 --> 01:09:34,520
<15-3,House>原来如此  那我收我的道歉
<15-3,House>Oh, well, then I take the apology back.

1226
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:37,770
<15-3,House>我们都是可悲的人
<15-3,House>We're all pathetic.

1227
01:09:38,650 --> 01:09:40,170
<15-3,House>这就是让一切有趣的秘密
<15-3,House>It's why makes everything interesting.

1228
01:09:40,780 --> 01:09:43,100
<15-4,Lydia>我受够了有趣的生活
<15-4,Lydia>I'm sick of life being interesting.

1229
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:35,570
<15-4,Lydia>女士们  先生们

01:15:25,970 --> 01:15:27,340
<16-9,House>晚上睡不着又怎样好呢
<16-9,House>If I can't get no sleep?

1258
01:15:28,420 --> 01:15:30,050
<16-10,Alvie>你上台前  就有一肚子话
<16-10,Alvie>You gotta thing before you act

1259
01:15:30,050 --> 01:15:31,720
<16-10,Alvie>你知道这只是过程
<16-10,Alvie>You know it is a progress

1260
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:37,520
<16-11,House>当你生活乱套  就顺其自然咯
<16-11,House>You don't make an action when your whole life is a mass

1261
01:15:40,010 --> 01:15:42,700
<16-12,Alvie>医生快告诉我该知道些什么
<16-12,Alvie>So tell me doctor I really got to know

1262
01:15:43,070 --> 01:15:44,370
<16-12,Alvie>怎么能变好
<16-12,Alvie>How to make me better?

1263
01:15:45,530 --> 01:15:47,040
<16-13,House>就来才艺表演吧
<16-13,House>Just do a talent show

1264
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:50,420
<16-14,Alvie>我猜那就是个灾难
<16-14,Alvie>And when I guess it's just a mass,

1265
01:15:50,510 --> 01:15:51,940
<16-14,Alvie>那是  你刚说的  兄弟
<16-14,Alvie>Yes, you just tell me, brother

1266
01:15:52,030 --> 01:15:53,310
<16-15,House>我们的生活就是如此不堪
<16-15,House>Our life is restlessness

1267
01:15:53,410 --> 01:15:54,910
<16-15,House>至少我们拥有彼此
<16-15,House>Unless we have each other

1268
01:15:54,910 --> 01:15:56,270
<16-16,Alvie>我们拥有彼此
<16-16,Alvie>Oh, we got each other.

01:15:56,290 --> 01:15:57,510
<16-16,Alvie>我们拥有彼此
<16-16,Alvie>Oh, we got each other...

1270
01:15:57,530 --> 01:15:59,620
<16-16,Alvie>就像血浓于水的亲兄弟
<16-16,Alvie>Like two brother have one mother，

1271
01:15:59,620 --> 01:16:01,710
<16-16,Alvie>叫你家老妈来看哦
<16-16,Alvie>Told you mother come on watch this

1281
01:16:34,450 --> 01:16:35,270
<17-4,Nolan>因为你不想
<17-4,Nolan>Because you don't want to complain

1282
01:16:35,370 --> 01:16:36,850
<17-4,Nolan>在一个承受丧父之痛的人面前抱怨吧
<17-4,Nolan>In front of the guy who just lost his father?

1283
01:16:38,230 --> 01:16:39,170
<17-5,House>我人没好到那种程度
<17-5,House>I'm not that cured.

1284
01:16:40,950 --> 01:16:42,780
<17-5,House>我还得做点什么  但是
<17-5,House>No, I still got stuff to do, but...

<18-1,House>I was trying to prove a point.

1288
01:17:15,990 --> 01:17:17,160
<18-1,House>我一心想做对的事
<18-1,House>I was trying to be right.

1289
01:17:18,770 --> 01:17:22,240
<18-1,House>却把你置身于危险之中
<18-1,House>I ended up putting you in a dangerous situation,

1290
01:17:22,330 --> 01:17:24,040
<18-1,House>而我自己却无力应对
<18-1,House>And I was not equipped to handle it.

1291

<18-1,House>你受了伤
<18-1,House>You got hurt,

01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:28,430
<20-2,Everyone>一去不复返
<20-2,Everyone>To never see her again!

1304
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:43,390
<20-2,Everyone>如果你沉默了二十多年
<20-2,Everyone>If you go silent for over a decade,

1305
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:45,980
<21-1,House>是不能一下子就回归社会
<21-1,House>You don't just get to slide right back into society.

1306
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:52,680
<21-2,Nolan>她会先去在亚利桑那州疗养院
<21-2,Nolan>She's going to a rehab facility first in Arizona.

1307
01:20:56,050 --> 01:20:57,230
<21-2,Nolan>她的家人要搬去那里
<21-2,Nolan>Her family's moving there.

01:21:00,470 --> 01:21:01,360
<21-2,Nolan>抱歉  豪斯
<21-2,Nolan>Sorry, House.

1309
01:21:02,610 --> 01:21:03,680
<21-2,Nolan>我也是刚刚得知的
<21-2,Nolan>I just found out myself.

1310
01:21:08,830 --> 01:21:10,430
<21-3,House>我要一个外出过夜许可
<21-3,House>I want an overnight pass.

1311
01:21:16,650 --> 01:21:17,870
<21-4,Nolan>我可以帮你
<21-4,Nolan>I can help you with this.

1312
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,450
<21-5,House>-那是我应得的  -那是  但
<21-5,House>- I've earned it. - You have, but

1313
01:21:19,540 --> 01:21:22,810
<21-7,House>信任我不正是治愈计划的一部分吗
<21-7,House>Isn't extending trust part of the whole "getting me better" thing?

1314
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:24,920
<21-8,Nolan>如果你坚持要许可  我可以给你
<21-8,Nolan>If you insist on a pass, I'll give it to you.

1315
01:21:25,190 --> 01:21:26,270
<21-8,Nolan>我知道你要去哪
<21-8,Nolan>But I know where you're going,

1316
01:21:26,290 --> 01:21:27,670
<21-8,Nolan>而且我知道你是一时冲动
<21-8,Nolan>And I know you haven't thought it through.

1317
01:21:29,780 --> 01:21:31,830
<21-8,Nolan>我们应该坐下来  好好谈谈
<21-8,Nolan>We need to sit down, talk about this.

1318
01:21:34,260 --> 01:21:35,500
<21-9,House>给我外出许可
<21-9,House>Please give me the pass.

1319
01:22:03,820 --> 01:22:04,440
<21-10,House>嗨
<21-10,House>Hi.

1320
01:22:04,950 --> 01:22:05,690
<21-11,Ben>你好

<21-12,House>我是
<21-12,House>I'm

1323
01:22:10,230 --> 01:22:11,700
<21-13,Lydia>本  进屋里去  好吗
<21-13,Lydia>Ben, go inside, okay?

1324
01:22:18,160 --> 01:22:19,350
<21-14,House>你就这么不辞而别吗
<21-14,House>You didn't say anything.

1325
01:22:20,550 --> 01:22:21,940
<21-14,House>安妮要走了
<21-14,House>And now Annie's leaving,

1326
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:24,260
<21-14,House>我听说你要去亚利桑那州
<21-14,House>And I hear you're going to Arizona.

1327
01:22:26,310 --> 01:22:28,580
<21-15,Lydia>我丈夫经常去凤凰城
<21-15,Lydia>My husband travels to Phoenix a lot.

1328
01:22:28,680 --> 01:22:30,440
<21-15,Lydia>他公司的总部在那
<21-15,Lydia>His corporate headquarters are there,

1329
01:22:31,250 --> 01:22:32,780
<21-15,Lydia>这么多年来我们一直想搬过去
<21-15,Lydia>And we've been wanting to move for years,

1330
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:34,290
<21-15,Lydia>但是我们被拴在这里
<21-15,Lydia>But we've been tethered here.

1331
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:36,290
<21-15,Lydia>现在我们解放了
<21-15,Lydia>And now we're not.

1332
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:40,480
<21-16,House>我不想让你走
<21-16,House>I don't want you to go.

1333
01:22:42,580 --> 01:22:43,750
<21-16,House>我也不想走
<21-16,House>I don't want to go.

1334
01:22:47,150 --> 01:22:49,810
<21-17,Lydia>但我不能拆散我的家庭
<21-17,Lydia>But I can't break up my family.

1335
01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:51,540
<21-17,Lydia>我不能抛下我的孩子
<21-17,Lydia>I-I can't leave my children.

1336
01:22:54,100 --> 01:22:55,640
<21-18,House>你不想改变现状
<21-18,House>So you don't want it to change.

1337
01:23:00,370 --> 01:23:03,300
<21-19,Lydia>很抱歉  我这么不辞而别
<21-19,Lydia>I'm sorry and I didn't come to say goodbye.

1338
01:23:06,170 --> 01:23:09,340
<21-19,Lydia>我想让这份美好的感觉留在心底
<21-19,Lydia>I thought it was kind of prefect

1339
01:23:17,100 --> 01:23:18,000
<21-19,Lydia>我得走了
<21-19,Lydia>I have to go.

1340
01:23:37,570 --> 01:23:40,780
<22-1,Nolan>你的许可证用得不是很开心
<22-1,Nolan>Not the most exciting use of the overnight pass I've ever seen.

1341
01:23:41,660 --> 01:23:42,670
<22-2,House>她走了
<22-2,House>She left.

1342
01:23:44,570 --> 01:23:45,350
<22-3,Nolan>还有就是
<22-3,Nolan>And...

1343
01:23:47,270 --> 01:23:48,170
<22-4,House>我不知所措了
<22-4,House>I'm lost.

1344
01:24:01,710 --> 01:24:05,520
<22-5,Nolan>我会为你写推荐信给医委会
<22-5,Nolan>I'm gonna write your letter to the medical board,

1345
01:24:06,460 --> 01:24:08,170
<22-5,Nolan>让他们返还你的行医执照
<22-5,Nolan>Recommending that they give your license back.

1346
01:24:09,170 --> 01:24:10,520
<22-6,House>你不能这样哄我
<22-6,House>You can't just console me

1347
01:24:10,630 --> 01:24:13,340
<22-6,House>就像给摔跤的孩子棒棒糖吃
<22-6,House>By giving me a lollipop when I skin my knee.

1348
01:24:13,450 --> 01:24:14,700
<22-7,Nolan>好吧  刚刚发生了两件事
<22-7,Nolan>Well, two things just happened.

1349
01:24:14,890 --> 01:24:15,720
<22-7,Nolan>你受了伤
<22-7,Nolan>You got hurt,

1350
01:24:16,060 --> 01:24:17,790
<22-7,Nolan>说明你和他人有所深交
<22-7,Nolan>Which means you connected to someone else,

1351
01:24:17,810 --> 01:24:19,350
<22-7,Nolan>并且深深地思念他们
<22-7,Nolan>Strongly enough to miss them.

1352
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:20,640
<22-7,Nolan>更重要的是
<22-7,Nolan>And more important...

1353
01:24:21,510 --> 01:24:23,810
<22-7,Nolan>你意识到心灵的痛  并且找我倾诉
<22-7,Nolan>You recognized the pain and came to talk to me,

1354
01:24:24,180 --> 01:24:26,400
<22-7,Nolan>而非把痛苦藏在维科丁药瓶里
<22-7,Nolan>Instead of hiding from it in the vicodin bottle.

1355
01:24:27,940 --> 01:24:29,820
<22-7,Nolan>你做到了  你受伤了  你来到这里
<22-7,Nolan>The fact that you're hurting and you came here,

1356
01:24:31,020 --> 01:24:32,530
<22-7,Nolan>你吃下给你开的药
<22-7,Nolan>The fact that you're taking your meds

1357
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:34,250
<22-7,Nolan>我们正在敞开心扉
<22-7,Nolan>And we're talking right now...

1358
01:24:37,220 --> 01:24:38,440
<22-7,Nolan>进去睡觉吧
<22-7,Nolan>Come inside and get some sleep.

1359
01:24:39,540 --> 01:24:41,050
<22-7,Nolan>明天你就可以走了
<22-7,Nolan>Tomorrow you can start saying your good-byes.

1360
01:24:49,110 --> 01:24:51,810
<23-1,Nolan>今天  我们在此祝贺格雷戈
<23-1,Nolan>Today we're here to congratulate Greg.

<23-2,Everyone>To never see her again!

1364
01:25:00,310 --> 01:25:01,280
<23-3,Alvie>豪斯

1365
01:25:15,660 --> 01:25:16,450
<23-4,House>走开
<23-4,House>Back off.

1366
01:25:16,990 --> 01:25:18,220
<23-4,House>大家已经觉得我们是同性恋了
<23-4,House>People already think we're gay.

1367
01:26:38,140 --> 01:26:39,370
<23-4,House>你想要什么  阿瓦
<23-4,House>What do you need, Alvie?

1368
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:40,610
<24-1,Beasley>我的药
<24-1,Beasley>My meds.

1369
01:26:43,770 --> 01:26:44,740
<24-2,Alvie>我想要好起来
<24-2,Alvie>I want to get better.
