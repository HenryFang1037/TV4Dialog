<5-5,House>如果不是约会, 就是公事
<5-5,House>If it's not a date,it is business.

<5-5,House>如果是公事, 你就不会说, 不关我的事
<5-5,House>And if it was business,you wouldn't say it was none of my business.

<5-9,House>把 chase 撤出新生儿重症室,我就闭口不谈你的约会
<5-9,House>Spring chase from nicu,and I'll shut up about your date.

<5-10,Cuddy>新生儿重症室缺人手
<5-10,Cuddy>Nicu is short-staffed.

143
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:28,360
<5-11,House>也就是说是他自己要求的, 是不是?
<5-11,House>Which means he asked for the assignment,didn't he?

144
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:32,370
<5-12,Cuddy>如果chase想避开你, 他有理由这么做
<5-12,Cuddy>If chase needs a break from you,he should take it.

00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:59,160
<6-4,Cameron>你无需这么说
<6-4,Cameron>You don't have to say that.

<11-5,Wilson>也可以用来治疗哮喘
<11-5,Wilson>It's also used to treat asthma.

230
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,580
<11-5,Wilson>牛皮藓...关节疼痛
<11-5,Wilson>Psoriasis...joint pain.

231
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:41,240
<11-6,House>她没有喘, 皮肤掉屑, 疼痛
<11-6,House>She doesn't wheeze,flake,or ache.

232
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:45,310
<11-6,House>所以她没有邀请呼吸科,或皮肤病医师吃晚餐
<11-6,House>And she didn't ask a pulmonologist or a dermatologist for dinner.

233
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,860
<11-6,House>她请了肿瘤学家
<11-6,House>She invited an oncologist.

234
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:52,080
<11-6,House>不是约会, 是医学参考
<11-6,House>It's not a date.It's a consult.

235
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:57,610
<11-7,Cameron>妈妈的 mri 显示没有结块, 脓肿,没有迹象--
<11-7,Cameron>Mom's mri was negative for masses,abscesses.There's no sign she has--

236
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:59,250
<11-8,House>太好了. 等查出什么来, 再--
<11-8,House>fascinating.Call me when we have--

237
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:01,660
<11-9,Cameron>她蛛网膜下出血
<11-9,Cameron>she has a subarachnoid bleed.

238
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:05,230
<12-1,House>病人为什么颅内出血?
<12-1,House>So why is our patient bleeding into her brain?

239
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:07,630
<12-2,Cameron>血液检查发现凝血酶原时间变长
<12-2,Cameron>Her blood workup shows her pro-time's elevated.

240
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:11,190
<12-3,House>出血是因为血不凝了,为什么不凝血?
<12-3,House>She's bleeding because she's not clotting.So why is she not clotting?

241
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,900
<12-3,House>带回来什么, 爸爸?
<12-3,House>What'd you bring us,daddy?

242
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:15,500
<12-4,Foreman>唯一影响状态的药物是伏特加
<12-4,Foreman>Only mood-altering drug was vodka.

243
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:16,790
<12-4,Foreman>藏在橱背后
<12-4,Foreman>The back of a drawer.

244
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:20,090
<12-5,Cameron>藏匿欢饮, 百分百是酒鬼的行径,这能解释出血
<12-5,Cameron>Hiding booze is classic alcoholic behavior.That'd explain the bleeding.

245
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:21,020
<12-6,Foreman>什么出血?
<12-6,Foreman>What bleeding?

246
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:22,240
<12-7,House>你不记得了?
<12-7,House>You don't remember?

247
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,770
<12-7,House>她早上喷你一身的血. 开玩笑
<12-7,House>She bled all over you this morning.Kidding.

248
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:28,010
<12-7,House>白痴真好玩. 难怪每个村子都有一个傻子
<12-7,House>Idiots are fun.No wonder every village wants one.

249
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:31,880
<12-8,Cameron>如果她酗酒,罹患血钙过高的可能性更大
<12-8,Cameron>If she's an alcoholic,she would also be more prone to hypercalcemia.

250
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:34,130
<12-9,Foreman>但毒性检测未发现酒精
<12-9,Foreman>But the tox screen was negative for alcohol.

251
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,430
<12-10,House>嘿, 这本是你的猜测
<12-10,House>Hey,it was your idea.

252
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:36,890
<12-10,House>现在更好了
<12-10,House>Now it's even better.

253
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:40,190
<12-10,House>妈妈戒酒了, 得了dts, 解释了昏厥,(dts 酒精戒断综合症, 震颤, 妄想)
<12-10,House>Mommy quits,she gets the dts.Even explains the seizure.

254
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,880
<12-11,Foreman>也可能是角色转换症
<12-11,Foreman>Also fits conversion disorder.

255
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:45,330
<12-11,Foreman>他们负债累累, 丈夫整日价工作,新生了宝宝
<12-11,Foreman>They're deep in debt.He's working round the clock.They got a new baby.

256
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,720
<12-11,Foreman>抽搐可能是心理紧张激发
<12-11,Foreman>I think the seizure was a physical response to psychological stress.

257
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,430
<12-12,House>酗酒的妈妈, 解释了更多的症状
<12-12,House>Boozy mommy covers more symptoms.

258
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:54,500
<12-12,House>在dts致死前, 给她镇静剂, 让她昏眠
<12-12,House>Put her in a nice phenobarbital coma before the dts kill her.

259
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,780
<12-13,House>你去干什么?
<12-13,House>Where are you going?

260
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,420
<12-14,Foreman>让她镇静昏睡
<12-14,Foreman>To put her in a pheno coma.

261
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,410
<12-15,House>万一我错了呢? 也许爸爸才是酒鬼?
<12-15,House>What if I'm wrong?What if daddy's the drunk?

262
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:02,790
<12-16,Cameron>你到底要不要给她用镇静剂？
<12-16,Cameron>You want us to give her the pheno or not?

263
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:04,130
<12-17,House>我要他争辩
<12-17,House>I want him to argue his point.

264
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:06,250
<12-18,Foreman>我以为你考虑过父亲, 排除他了
<12-18,Foreman>I assumed you considered the father and ruled him out.

265
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:09,880
<12-19,House>怎么说来着的?,"你一假定, 就成眼中钉."
<12-19,House>What's that saying?"When you ass-sume,you become a pain in the ass to me."

266
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,100
<12-20,Foreman>我为什么要争论? 你制服了我
<12-20,Foreman>Why should I argue?You'd just overrule me.

267
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:16,360
<12-21,House>- 够了! 养养马, 种种西瓜去吧.,- house!
<12-21,House>Enough! Get a pony or a watermelon farm.--House!

268
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,300
<12-23,House>他怎么没有反应. 我要他有点人样
<12-23,House>I need him to react.I need him to act like a human being.

269
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,690
<12-23,House>我要他快点恢复讨人嫌的死后重生
<12-23,House>I need him to get over this boring near-death rebirth.

270
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:26,230
<12-24,Foreman>我改变了. 这无法恢复
<12-24,Foreman>I have changed.It's not something you get over.

271
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:28,660
<12-25,House>濒死经历或许会改变一切
<12-25,House>Nearly dying changes everything forever.

272
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:31,230
<12-25,House>在两个月以内. 两个月已经过长了
<12-25,House>For about two months.Two months is too long.

273
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,160
<12-25,House>我要我聘请的那个人回来, 现在
<12-25,House>I need the guy i hired back,now.

274
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:36,660
<12-26,Foreman>无论你的痛苦多么想要同伴,我的痛苦不与你做伴
<12-26,Foreman>Now matter how much your misery loves company,it's not getting mine.

275
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,970
<12-26,Foreman>我去和爸爸谈谈. Cameron去找妈妈
<12-26,Foreman>I'll talk to the dad.Cameron can take the mom.

276
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:40,640
<12-26,Foreman>会查出妈妈是不是酒鬼
<12-26,Foreman>We'll figure out if mom was a drinkerer.

277
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,940
<12-27,House>浪费时间. 在dts杀死她之前, 让她昏迷
<12-27,House>Waste of time.Put her in a coma before the dts kill her.

278
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,320
<12-27,House>唔...
<12-27,House>So...

279
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:07,430
<13-1,Cuddy>是分居还是...
<13-1,Cuddy>is this a separation or...

280
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:11,710
<13-2,Wilson>嗯, 律师找好了. 朋友们分了阵营
<13-2,Wilson>well,lawyers have been hired.Friends divvied up.

281
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:14,880
<13-2,Wilson>奇怪的是, 她没有争房子
<13-2,Wilson>Oddly,she didn't fight me for house.

282
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,910
<13-3,Cuddy>至少你们没孩子
<13-3,Cuddy>At least there aren'T...kids involved.

283
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:20,300
<13-3,Cuddy>只要搞定彼此二人
<13-3,Cuddy>You just have each other to deal with.

284
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,980
<13-4,Wilson>如果有孩子的话,也许我们会付出更多
<13-4,Wilson>If there had been kids,maybe we would have done more of that.

285
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:31,380
<13-5,Cuddy>你想要孩子?
<13-5,Cuddy>Do you want kids?

286
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:38,060
<13-6,Wilson>看, 有没有特别的事情你想--
<13-6,Wilson>Listen,is there anything in particular you wanted to--

287
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:41,960
<13-6,Wilson>- 有关医院的?,- 只是交流感情
<13-6,Wilson>hospital business or--catching up.

288
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,370
<13-7,Cuddy>我是说, 你看
<13-7,Cuddy>I mean,you know,it's not like...

289
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,620
<13-7,Cuddy>我们两人家里都没人等着赶回去
<13-7,Cuddy>either one of us has anybody to run home to.

290
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:50,790
<13-7,Cuddy>没有
<13-7,Cuddy>No.

291
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:03,730
<14-1,Cameron>感觉怎么样?
<14-1,Cameron>How are you feeling?

292
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,080
<14-2,Kara>还行, 有点头昏眼花
<14-2,Kara>Okay.A little groggy.

293
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:11,090
<14-3,Cameron>有人来看你
<14-3,Cameron>There's somebody here to see you.

294
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,920
<14-4,Brent>嘿, mikey. 妈妈醒了
<14-4,Brent>Hey,mikey.Mommy's awake.

295
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:26,230
<14-5,Kara>哦, mikey. 哦, 天, 我吓坏了
<14-5,Kara>Oh,mikey.Oh,gosh,I was so scared.

296
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:33,450
<14-5,Kara>哦, 我爱你. 我真爱你
<14-5,Kara>Oh,I love you.I love you so much.

297
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:38,820
<14-5,Kara>对不起
<14-5,Kara>I'm sorry.

298
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,710
<14-6,Brent>你不需要道歉
<14-6,Brent>You don't have anything to be sorry about.

299
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,860
<14-6,Brent>你病了
<14-6,Brent>You were sick.

300
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,420
<15-1,Foreman>原来她和丈夫在嗜酒劝戒会相识
<15-1,Foreman>Turns out she and her husband met in aa.

301
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:59,000
<15-1,Foreman>显然, 她复发了
<15-1,Foreman>Obviously,she slipped.

302
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:00,010
<15-1,Foreman>猜得好
<15-1,Foreman>Good call.

303
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:05,140
<15-2,House>并不困难, 因另一个方案,是你愚蠢的心理紊乱理论
<15-2,House>It wasn't hard,considering my other choice was your stupid psych theory.

304
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,410
<15-2,House>那其实并不愚蠢
<15-2,House>Which was not stupid.

305
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:11,990
<15-2,House>警告你, 必要时, 我会扔核炸弹
<15-2,House>I tell you,I'm gonna drop the n-bomb if I have to.

306
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:14,490
<15-3,Foreman>你对冲突上瘾了
<15-3,Foreman>You're addicted to conflict.

307
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:16,250
<15-4,House>改名字了? (house原对止痛药上瘾)
<15-4,House>Did they change the name?

308
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,840
<15-5,Foreman>不拖上 chase, 你也能处理这案例
<15-5,Foreman>You could have handled this patient without dragging chase in.

309
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,820
<15-5,Foreman>但是他不愿加入, 让你狠得牙痒痒
<15-5,Foreman>But that fact that he didn't want in killed you.

310
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:24,280
<15-5,Foreman>就好比你不能激怒我一样
<15-5,Foreman>Just like the fact you can't get a rise out of me.

311
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:30,540
<15-6,House>宝宝在哪里?
<15-6,House>Where's the baby?

312
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,320
<15-6,House>放开我!
<15-6,House>Get off me!

313
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,700
<15-7,House>不! 我必须这么做!
<15-7,House>No! I have to do this!

314
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:46,330
<15-7,House>没有呼吸声. 急救车, 肾上腺素
<15-7,House>No breath sounds.Crash cart and epi,stat!

315
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:50,890
<15-7,House>说了, 你的心理紊乱理论不愚蠢
<15-7,House>Told you your psych theory wasn't stupid.

316
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,250
<16-1,Foreman>你儿子没事
<16-1,Foreman>Your son is stable.

317
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,550
<16-1,Foreman>但缺氧毁了他的肾脏
<16-1,Foreman>But the lack of oxygen damaged his kidneys.

318
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:00,190
<16-2,Brent>她肯定是翻身, 不小心压到了
<16-2,Brent>She must have rolled over on him by mistake.

319
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:04,340
<16-3,Foreman>Mason 先生... 我亲眼所见
<16-3,Foreman>Mr. Mason...I was there.

320
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,620
<16-3,Foreman>你妻子要闷死你儿子
<16-3,Foreman>Your wife tried to smother your son.

321
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:11,540
<16-4,Brent>不可能
<16-4,Brent>That's impossible.

322
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,140
<16-4,Brent>Kara 不会伤害 mikey
<16-4,Brent>Kara would never hurt mikey.

323
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:21,610
<17-1,Kara>他知道, 他们说 mikey 知道
<17-1,Kara>He knows.They said mikey knows.

324
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,470
<17-2,Cameron>你听到声音?
<17-2,Cameron>You hear voices?

325
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:27,600
<17-3,Kara>他们不停地说, 那样对mikey最好...
<17-3,Kara>They wouldn't quit saying that mikey would be better off if...

326
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:31,880
<17-3,Kara>他们是对的
<17-3,Kara>they were right.

327
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,530
<17-3,Kara>试着治疗的抽搐, 本不存在
<17-3,Kara>We've been trying to diagnose a seizure that didn't exist.

328
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,190
<18-1,Cameron>她被丈夫发现时, 就假装
<18-1,Cameron>She faked it when her husband caught her.

329
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,610
<18-2,Foreman>不是她装出来的
<18-2,Foreman>I don't think she faked it.

330
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,720
<18-3,Cameron>她在溺死孩子时, 正好抽疯了?
<18-3,Cameron>She just happened to seize right in the middle of drowning her child?

331
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,200
<18-3,Cameron>孩子倒是逃过一劫
<18-3,Cameron>Good break for the kid.

332
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,070
<18-4,House>嘿, 对 foreman 客气点
<18-4,House>Hey,take it easy on foreman.

333
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:49,190
<18-4,House>他可是在脑叶被秘密打结的情况下干活
<18-4,House>He's playing with one lobe tied behind his back.

334
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,660
<18-5,Foreman>产后忧郁症让她想溺死自己的孩子
<18-5,Foreman>Postpartum psychosis makes her want to drown her kid.

335
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:53,680
<18-5,Foreman>内心的交战促发了抽搐
<18-5,Foreman>The internal conflict triggers a seizure.

336
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,010
<18-6,House>你知道还有什么是诱因?
<18-6,House>You know what else might be a trigger?

337
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,590
<18-6,House>身体上的疾病. 很荒谬吧, 我知道
<18-6,House>Physical illness. It's a wild idea,I know.

338
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:59,910
<18-6,House>特别是当她没什么明显的生理症状
<18-6,House>Especially since she doesn't have any obviously physical symptoms.

339
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:02,480
<18-6,House>"没有"内出血和血钙超量
<18-6,House>Like internal bleeding or excess calcium.

340
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,990
<18-7,Foreman>我去抽点血. 检查一下
<18-7,Foreman>I'll draw some blood.test for it.

341
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:08,130
<18-8,House>天, 你又来了! 你就不能跟我吵吗?!
<18-8,House>Jeez,you've done it again!Will you argue with me?!

342
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:11,330
<18-8,House>酒鬼常饮食不善. 可以解释出血和血钙
<18-8,House>Drinkers don't eat right.Explains the bleeding and the calcium.

343
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:12,740
<18-8,House>可能只是饮酒过度
<18-8,House>This might just be some crazy drunk,

344
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:15,790
<18-8,House>我却告诉你, 她会由于脑膜骨髓瘤而死
<18-8,House>and I'm telling you that she's about to die of myelomatous meningitis.

345
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:18,380
<18-10,House>- 我们已经查过了,- 没错, 疯狂的想法
<18-10,House>We already tested for--exactly!It's an insane idea.

346
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:20,070
<18-11,Foreman>好, 你要我干什么?
<18-11,Foreman>Okay.What do you want me to do?

347
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:22,090
<18-12,House>有点原创想法
<18-12,House>Have an original thought.

348
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,100
<18-12,House>现在, 诱使她再次发病
<18-12,House>In the meantime,stress her into having another seizure.

349
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,640
<18-13,Foreman>不行, 她在使用氟哌啶醇 (强镇定剂)
<18-13,Foreman>We can't,she's on haloperidol.

350
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,810
<18-14,House>不可以, 还因为太危险, 且不人道
<18-14,House>You also can't because it's dangerous and highly unethical.

351
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:32,190
<18-14,House>不过, 被抓住时, 你可以假装不会冲咖啡
<18-14,House>Therefore,if you get caught,pretend you can't make coffee.

352
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,660
<18-14,House>智力缺陷让人放松警惕
<18-14,House>Mental defectives get tons of slack.

353
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:40,590
<18-14,House>停用氟哌啶醇.,把她连上脑电图扫描, 闪光刺激她
<18-14,House>Take off the haloperidol. Hook her up to an eeg,flash some lights.

354
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:42,100
<18-14,House>让她喘气, 注射安慰剂,(没有药理作用的药剂)
<18-14,House>Make her pant.Shoot her up with a placebo.

355
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:45,040
<18-14,House>如果她开始抽搐,脑电图也跟着抽, 那是真的
<18-14,House>When she starts twitching,if the machine twitches along,it's real...if not,

356
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,580
<18-14,House>如果没有, 叫警察来, 她是个精神病杀手
<18-14,House>call the cops,'cause she's a psycho killer.

357
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,860
<18-15,Cameron>- 别逼他了,- 别保护他了
<18-15,Cameron>Stop pushing him.--stop protecting him.

358
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:57,740
<18-17,Cameron>他需要保护
<18-17,Cameron>He needs it.

359
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:59,170
<18-18,House>不需要, 如果他想好起来
<18-18,House>Not if he wants to get better.

360
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,840
<18-19,Cameron>他可能好不了了
<18-19,Cameron>He might not be able to get better.

361
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:02,150
<18-20,House>嗯, 这样的话, 我就重新请个神经学家
<18-20,House>Well,then,I need a new neurologist.

362
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:03,650
<18-21,Cameron>他因为工作而病
<18-21,Cameron>He got sick doing his job.

363
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:06,540
<18-22,House>如果他因公殉职, 就不用付他薪水了
<18-22,House>If he got killed doing his job,I wouldn't keep him on the payroll.

364
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:10,880
<18-22,House>我不管你有多内疚,还是为他的重生有多感动
<18-22,House>I don't care how guilty you feel or how touched you are by his reborn spirit.

365
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:11,930
<18-23,Cameron>我没有被感动
<18-23,Cameron>I'm not touched.

366
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:12,850
<18-24,House>那你是由内疚驱使
<18-24,House>Then you're guilt-ridden.

367
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:13,880
<18-25,Cameron>我没有内疚
<18-25,Cameron>I'm not guilt-ridden.

368
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,020
<18-26,House>那你真是可悲
<18-26,House>Then you're pathetic.

369
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:17,120
<18-27,Cameron>现在, 我被激怒了!,让他在癫痫实验室里彻夜工作
<18-27,Cameron>Right now,I'm annoyed!Keeping him up all night in a seizure lab

370
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,710
<18-27,Cameron>不利于他的康复! 太辛苦了!
<18-27,Cameron>is not the way to advance his recovery!It's too much!

371
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:22,160
<18-28,House>不错. 你应该盯着点
<18-28,House>You're right.You should stick around.

372
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:24,510
<18-28,House>以防他出错
<18-28,House>Make sure he doesn't screw up.

373
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:35,330
<19-1,Foreman>kara, 盯着灯光看
<19-1,Foreman>kara,look directly into the light.

374
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,170
<19-1,Foreman>盯着看
<19-1,Foreman>Keep looking.

375
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,490
<19-1,Foreman>以为你今天下班了
<19-1,Foreman>Thought you'd be gone for the day.

376
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:44,600
<19-2,Cameron>想等到骨髓切片检查结果出来
<19-2,Cameron>Thought I'd wait for the bone marrow biopsy results.

377
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,810
<19-3,Foreman>House 派你来照看我, 是吗?
<19-3,Foreman>House sent you to baby-sit me,didn't he?

378
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:48,660
<19-4,Cameron>他让我等着结果
<19-4,Cameron>He asked me to wait for the results.

379
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:49,880
<19-5,Foreman>哦, cameron, 没事的
<19-5,Foreman>Oh,cameron,it's fine.

380
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,770
<19-6,Cameron>当然了
<19-6,Cameron>Of course it is.

381
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:56,860
<19-7,Foreman>瞧, 几星期前,你因为我不把你当朋友而难过
<19-7,Foreman>look,A few weeks ago,you were upset that I didn't consider you a friend.

382
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,230
<19-7,Foreman>现在, 你却因为我快乐而难过
<19-7,Foreman>Now you're upset that I'm happy?

383
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,860
<19-8,Cameron>无话可说, 很明显, 我是个贱人
<19-8,Cameron>What can I say?Apparently,I'm a bitch.

384
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,790
<19-9,Foreman>我可没说哦
<19-9,Foreman>I didn't say that.

385
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:04,940
<19-10,Cameron>让人生气
<19-10,Cameron>It's annoying.

386
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:06,700
<19-10,Cameron>坚持你的每一天是上天恩赐如同
<19-10,Cameron>Insisting every day of your life is a blessing is

387
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:09,830
<19-10,Cameron>指正别人都是肤浅的. 太老套了
<19-10,Cameron>basically calling everyone else shallow.It gets old.

388
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:10,870
<19-11,Foreman>- 抱歉
<19-11,Foreman>--Sorry.

389
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:13,640
<19-12,Cameron>- 哦, 省省吧
<19-12,Cameron>--Oh,give it a rest.

390
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:19,770
<20-1,House>晚餐怎么样?
<20-1,House>How was dinner?

391
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:22,900
<20-2,Wilson>Cuddy 没有提到肿瘤
<20-2,Wilson>Cuddy did not mention cancer.

392
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,750
<20-3,House>她临阵退缩了
<20-3,House>She lost her nerve.

393
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:27,090
<20-4,Wilson>那是个约会
<20-4,Wilson>It was a date.

394
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:29,710
<20-5,House>你在干什么?
<20-5,House>What are you doing?

395

<20-6,Wilson>PCR实验,(多聚酶链式反应, 扩增DNA)
<20-6,Wilson>Pcr test.

396
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:36,350
<20-7,House>你亲自做? 在大半夜的
<20-7,House>You're doing it yourself?In the middle of the night.

397
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,220
<20-7,House>从勺子上
<20-7,House>On a spoon.

398
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:41,290
<20-7,House>Cuddy的勺子
<20-7,House>Cuddy's spoon.

399
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:44,400
<20-8,Wilson>检查她的口水, 是否有癌症标记
<20-8,Wilson>I'm checking her saliva for cancer markers.

400
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:50,480
<20-9,House>是啊... 我也常在约会后这么做
<20-9,House>Yeah...I do that after all my dates too.

401
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,270
<20-9,House>你是公认的好人
<20-9,House>People think you're the nice one.

402
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:55,450
<20-10,Wilson>为什么对 cuddy 这么关心?
<20-10,Wilson>Why are you so worried about cuddy?

403
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:57,530
<20-11,House>你先说
<20-11,House>You go first.

404
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,200
<20-11,House>你渴望这是个约会
<20-11,House>You desperately want this to be a date.

405
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:02,540
<20-12,Wilson>不是约会那就是癌症了
<20-12,Wilson>Because the alternative is cancer.

406
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,460
<20-13,House>承认你喜欢她吧
<20-13,House>Just admit that you like her.

407

409
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:11,190
<20-13,House>真好, 你不在乎她是个魔鬼
<20-13,House>It's great you can look beyond the fact she's the devil.

410
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:13,630
<20-14,Wilson>我偷了她的勺子, 你偷了她的垃圾
<20-14,Wilson>I stole a spoon.You stole her garbage.

411
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,520
<20-15,House>她是我的老板
<20-15,House>She's my boss.

412
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,940
<20-15,House>她要是病了, 医院就会把她换下
<20-15,House>She gets sick,the hospital might replace her.

413
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,660
<20-15,House>特别当她病死时
<20-15,House>Especially if she dies.

414
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:23,200
<20-15,House>我就得学习怎么操控新老板
<20-15,House>I'd have to learn how to manipulate someone new.

415
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:26,860
<20-16,Wilson>我想我会哭的
<20-16,Wilson>I think I'm gonna cry.

00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:30,210
<20-17,House>有结果时告诉我
<20-17,House>Find me when the results come in.

417
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:41,530
<21-1,Chase>Mason 先生, 由于你孩子肾脏的损坏
<21-1,Chase>Mr. Mason...because of the damage done to your son's kidneys,

00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:44,020
<21-1,Chase>他血钾的含量直升
<21-1,Chase>his potassium is climbing.

419
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:46,510
<21-1,Chase>会导致不规律的心跳
<21-1,Chase>It's causing irregular heartbeats.

420
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:50,010
<21-1,Chase>我加倍了药量, 开始给他做透析
<21-1,Chase>I'm doubling the meds and starting him on dialysis.

421
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:53,390
<21-1,Chase>除非他血钾降下来...
<21-1,Chase>Unless we get his potassium down...

422
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:57,640
<21-1,Chase>不然, 他心脏病发作
<21-1,Chase>he's gonna have a heart attack.

423
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:02,380
<22-1,Foreman>Kara, 再要几分钟就好
<22-1,Foreman>Kara,just another few minutes.

424
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:06,250
<22-2,Cameron>活检结果出来了, 没有得脑膜骨髓瘤
<22-2,Cameron>Biopsy's back.She's negative for myelomatous meningitis.

425
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:08,510
<22-3,Foreman>她也没有发作
<22-3,Foreman>And she's not seizing.

426
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:11,080
<22-3,Foreman>那么我们和 house 都错了
<22-3,Foreman>So we're wrong and house is wrong.

427
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:13,240
<22-4,Cameron>你可以接受?
<22-4,Cameron>And you're okay with that?

428
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:16,000
<22-4,Cameron>她有反应了
<22-4,Cameron>She's seizing.

429
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,210
<22-5,Foreman>她没有动作
<22-5,Foreman>She's not doing anything.

430
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:25,140
<22-6,Cameron>大脑活动没有加快. 而是变缓慢了
<22-6,Cameron>Brain activity isn't aclerating.It's slowing down.

431
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:32,290
<23-1,Cameron>肌肉僵硬, 不自觉握放和吮吸动作
<23-1,Cameron>muscle rigidity,involuntary grasping and sucking motions.

432
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:35,040
<23-1,Cameron>她得了脑部谵妄
<23-1,Cameron>She's in an encephalopathic delirium.

433
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:40,300
<23-2,House>嗯, 原发性的生理疾病. 排除了几件事
<23-2,House>Mmm,a genuine physiological illness.That rules out a few things.

434
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,800
<23-2,House>诸如, 我想想?
<23-2,House>Like what,I wonder?

435

<23-3,Foreman>产后忧郁症和角色转换失调
<23-3,Foreman>Postpartum psychosis and conversion disorder.

436
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:47,790
<23-4,House>当个好失败者的要点...你仍旧是失败者
<23-4,House>Thing about being a good loser...you're still a loser.

437
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:51,310
<23-5,Foreman>谵妄说明她的大脑停止运转
<23-5,Foreman>The delirium means her brain is shutting down,

438
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:53,370
<23-6,Cameron>切换到最本能功用
<23-6,Cameron>reverting to its most instinctual functions.

439
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,090
<23-7,House>因病情发展了, 也许可以看作是进展
<23-7,House>Since it's progressing,maybe we can assume it's progressive.

440
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:59,640
<23-7,House>说明距离大脑关门歇业就不远了
<23-7,House>Which means it won't be long before the brain closes shop altogether.

441
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,430
<23-7,House>有主意吗?
<23-7,House>Ideas?

442

<24-2,Chase>血钾还是太高了
<24-2,Chase>Potassium's still too high.

<24-2,Chase>没有脉搏, 把机器拿开
<24-2,Chase>No pulse.Get him off the machine.

00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:19,940
<24-2,Chase>调到10. 离手
<24-2,Chase>Charge at 10.Clear.

446
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,900
<24-3,Nurse>还在室颤
<24-3,Nurse>Still in v fib.

447
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:26,040
<24-4,Chase>再打一针肾上腺素
<24-4,Chase>Another amp of epi.

<25-1,House>Damn it,chase shouldn't be wasting his time in nicu.

<25-10,Foreman>她酗酒. 酒鬼容易得糙皮病
<25-10,Foreman>She drinks.Alcoholics get pellagra.

<25-10,Foreman>他们吃垃圾食物, 不摄入烟酸
<25-10,Foreman>They eat lousy diets,so no niacin.

464

<25-11,House>他同意我观点. 太震惊了
<25-11,House>He agrees with me.What a shock.

<25-13,Cameron>We give kara niacin,she'll come out of her delirium and she'll be totally sane.

<25-14,Chase>她永不能恢复理智
<25-14,Chase>Don't think she's ever gonna be sane again.

<26-11,Foreman>让你相信不存在的事
<26-11,Foreman>It made you believe things that were not real.

483
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:45,460
<26-12,Kara>比如声音
<26-12,Kara>Like the voices.

<26-12,Kara>我, 嗯... 记得对 mikey 做过什么

<26-16,Kara>但, 你... 你制止我了
<26-16,Kara>But I...you...you stopped me.

490
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:30,290
<26-16,Kara>还有... 另一个医生让 mikey 又呼吸了
<26-16,Kara>And,uh...that other doctor.He got mikey breathing.

491
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:34,880
<26-17,Foreman>你孩子的器官受损太严重了
<26-17,Foreman>Your son's organs were damaged too severely.

<26-17,Foreman>他今天早上死了

00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:55,330
<26-18,Kara>噢, 我的天
<26-18,Kara>Oh,my god.

496
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:02,170
<27-1,Foreman>烟酸缺乏不会导致呕血
<27-1,Foreman>pellagra doesn't cause bloody vomit.

497
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:04,100
<27-1,Foreman>她还病着, 而且在恶化
<27-1,Foreman>She's still sick,and getting worse.

<27-2,House>什么导致烟酸缺乏和狂喷血?
<27-2,House>So what causes pellagra and crimson spew?

<27-2,House>宝宝死了, 虽然悲伤, 但不是我们的难题
<27-2,House>Dead baby,while sad,not our problem.

500
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:15,090
<27-3,Chase>我应给他更多的降钾树脂
<27-3,Chase>I should have given him more polystyrene.

<27-4,House>你杀了他
<27-4,House>You killed him.

<27-4,House>你要是不振作, 还会杀了他妈妈
<27-4,House>If you don't get over it,you're gonna kill mama too.

503
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:22,040
<27-5,Cameron>酗酒造成她缺烟酸,也许也能解释呕吐. 胃炎
<27-5,Cameron>her alcoholism caused the pellagra.Maybe it also explains the vomiting.Gastritis.

504
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,870
<27-6,Foreman>胃炎的药没起作用
<27-6,Foreman>Gastritis meds aren't helping.

505
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:26,690
<27-6,Foreman>能够证实她的叙述, 她戒了酒精
<27-6,Foreman>Which may confirm her story she only slipped once.

506
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:30,060
<27-7,Cameron>把饮酒从方程式移走,内出血, 高血钙, 惊厥
<27-7,Cameron>You remove the drinking from the equation,internal bleeding,hypercalcemia,seizure,

507
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,420
<27-7,Cameron>烟酸缺乏, 都要新的解释
<27-7,Cameron>and pellagra are all back in.

508
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:35,920
<27-8,House>Chase, 把你的头从死婴的屁股里拔出来,关注一下垂死的--
<27-8,House>Chase will you get your head out of the dead ba's butt and focus on the barely alive--

509
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:41,830
<27-8,House>你给了小孩多少降钾树脂
<27-8,House>how much polystyrene did you give the kid?

510
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:43,250
<27-9,Chase>一克

00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:46,650
<27-9,Chase>血钾还是不停升高
<27-9,Chase>His potassium just kept rising.

512

<28-1,House>我要你的孩子
<28-1,House>I need your son.

513
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,210
<28-2,Brent>你是谁?
<28-2,Brent>Who are you?

514
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:13,580
<28-3,House>你妻子的医生, 你孩子和她可能情况相同
<28-3,House>Your wife's doctor.Your son may have had the same condition she does.

515
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:17,280
<28-4,Brent>我孩子没有得病. 是她害死的
<28-4,Brent>My son didn't have a condition.She killed him.

516
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,190
<28-5,House>如果检查她的肠子, 她血会喷涌
<28-5,House>If I biopsy her intestine,she'll bleed out.

517
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:23,320
<28-5,House>很明显他不会了
<28-5,House>He obviously won'T.

518
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:26,650
<28-6,Brent>不准你用我儿子的身体来帮助她
<28-6,Brent>You're not using my son's body to help her.

519
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:32,680
<28-7,House>好, 用一瓶啤酒交换行吗?
<28-7,House>Okay. How about trading him for a beer?

520
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:36,370
<28-7,House>或许你更偏爱威士忌
<28-7,House>Or maybe you're more of a whisky guy.

521
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:40,390
<28-7,House>进医院的那天早晨,你不是感染了链球菌, 或是恶心
<28-7,House>You didn't have strep or a stomach bug the morning you came in.

522
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:42,780
<28-7,House>呕吐是因为宿醉
<28-7,House>You puked because you were hung over.

523
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:46,900
<28-7,House>指控一个康复了的酒鬼故态复萌,多数情况下, 你是正确的
<28-7,House>Accuse a recovered drunk of slipping,most of the time,you'd be right.

524
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,610
<28-8,Brent>我喝酒了
<28-8,Brent>So I drink.

525
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,970
<28-8,Brent>仿佛这是我的过错
<28-8,Brent>You're acting like this is my fault.

526
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:53,070
<28-9,House>人们会为你感到难过
<28-9,House>People are gonna feel sorry for you.

527
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:56,870
<28-9,House>他们安慰你, 你无法预知,事实上, 你可以
<28-9,House>They'll tell you that you can't anticipate the unthinkable.The fact is,you can.

528
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:59,310
<28-9,House>只是没那么愉快
<28-9,House>It's just not all that pleasant.

529
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:00,380
<28-10,Brent>你什么都不知道
<28-10,Brent>You don't know anything about--

530
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,160
<28-11,House>我知道人在疯狂到杀害某人前
<28-11,House>I know that people don't get crazy enough to kill someone

531
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:05,550
<28-11,House>会首先被发现行止疯狂
<28-11,House>without first being crazy enough for someone to notice.

532
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:09,420
<28-11,House>有多少次, 你出去饮酒, 因为她哭泣?
<28-11,House>How many times did you go out for a drink because she was crying?

533
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:11,230
<28-11,House>多少次你留下工作
<28-11,House>How many times did you stay at work

534
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:14,640
<28-11,House>因为你不想听到, 她说,她是多么糟糕的母亲
<28-11,House>because you couldn't listen to her telling you what a bad mother she is?

535
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:18,060
<28-11,House>当她安静时, 你宽心了
<28-11,House>You were relieved when she shut down.

536
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:21,650
<28-11,House>她数小时静坐
<28-11,House>Just sat staring for hours at a time.

537
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:24,200
<28-11,House>把枕头蒙在孩子头上
<28-11,House>She held the pillow over his head.

538
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,300
<28-11,House>她发疯时, 你熟睡
<28-11,House>You slept while she went nuts.

539
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:27,860
<28-11,House>- 可能没那么精确, 但--
<28-11,House>--Not exactly a draw,but--

540
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,300
<28-12,Brent>-- 你有病吗?
<28-12,Brent>--what is wrong with you?

541
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:32,560
<28-12,Brent>什么样的人, 会在此时说出这种话
<28-12,Brent>What kind of a person says those things now.

542
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,570
<28-13,House>让我做检测
<28-13,House>Let me do the test.

543
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:39,220
<28-13,House>能够多少减轻你的负罪感
<28-13,House>It'll be one less thing for you to feel crappy about.

544
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:51,640
<29-1,House>弄到个死宝宝, 给你做组织检查
<29-1,House>Got a dead baby for you to biopsy.

545

<29-3,House>I could get you transferred.

548
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:59,420
<29-4,Chase>告诉过你了, 我就是想信任病人
<29-4,Chase>I told you,I just wanted to trust patients.

<29-5,House>别针对病人胡扯了
<29-5,House>You don't give a crap about patients.

<29-5,House>奇怪. 富哥儿做这么多, 为了额外的钱
<29-5,House>Strange.Rich boy doing all that for some extra cash.

554

<29-7,House>你爸爸有钱. 现在他死了
<29-7,House>But your dad was.Now he's dead.

556
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:29,210
<29-7,House>如果你没钱了, 说明老爸没给你
<29-7,House>If you're not rich,that means that daddy cut you out.

557

<32-7,House>用你自己的时间来缓和情绪吧
<32-7,House>Deal with it on your own time.

<32-11,House>真可惜, 他的小船没有靠岸,他本会很开心的
<32-11,House>It's too bad he didn't land the gig.He would have had fun.

<32-12,Cuddy>我考虑精子捐赠, 不是合欢
<32-12,Cuddy>I was considering a donation.Not a party.

<33-2,House>噢, 我知道. 你当时神智不清
<33-2,House>Oh,I know.You were insane.

<33-4,House>The only difference in this case is...it wasn't the same someone.

631

<33-5,Kara>我可以制止的
<33-5,Kara>I could have stopped.

632

<33-5,Kara>我本可以不听那些幻音
<33-5,Kara>I didn't have to listen to those voices.

<33-7,Kara>Those voices...felt as real to me as...as michael's hand.

637
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:21,090
<33-7,Kara>当他就在我怀里, 吮奶时
<33-7,Kara>Right here,when he nursed.

638
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:25,350
<33-7,Kara>还有... 他的发香
<33-7,Kara>And...the smell of his hair.

639
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:34,280
<33-8,House>你不应受死
<33-8,House>You do not deserve to die.

643
00:39:58,050 --> 00:40:00,680
<34-2,Foreman>我们可以声称她精神不稳定,,指定一个医学代理人
<34-2,Foreman>So we get her declared unstable,appoint a medical proxy.

<34-3,House>她曾经不稳定. 现在完全理性了
<34-3,House>She was unstable.Now she's sane.

<34-4,Foreman>You have to change her mind.You can't just walk away.

<34-5,House>好! 走进去告诉她, 每一天都是恩赐
<34-5,House>Fine!Go on in there and tell her that every day is a blessing.

<34-5,House>"你杀了自己的孩子. 遗忘吧,想开点, 至少你还活着."
<34-5,House>"So you killed your baby.Shake it off.Think positive.At least you're alive."

649
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:19,830
<34-5,House>当你自己都不再信仰时,很难取信于人了, 是吗?
<34-5,House>Kind of hard to sell when you don't believe it,huh?

00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:21,180
<34-5,House>你从没有信仰过
<34-5,House>And you never believed it.

<34-5,House>你只是想经历的磨难, 能有些意义
<34-5,House>You just wanted all that crap you went through to mean something.

<34-5,House>告诉你, 没有意义. 从没有过. 欢迎回来
<34-5,House>Well,it didn't mean anything.It never does.Welcome back.

<34-6,Foreman>这为什么如此对我? 我本来很愉快
<34-6,Foreman>Why are you doing this to me?I was happy.

654
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,740
<34-7,House>你热切地想要觉得满足
<34-7,House>You were aspiring to be content.

655

<34-8,Foreman>不要就语义争辩
<34-8,Foreman>Don't give me a semantic argument.

<34-8,Foreman>我满意生活的原样! 这就是幸福
<34-8,Foreman>I was content with the way things were!That's what happiness is.

<34-9,House>是, 如果每个人都为已有的感到满足,多么美妙的世界
<34-9,House>Yeah,if we were all just satisfied with what we had,what a beautiful world it would be.

<34-9,House>我们都将在污秽中饥饿至死,不过至少我们快乐
<34-9,House>We'd all slowly starve to death in our own filth,but at least we'd be happy.

<34-9,House>要是每天清晨醒来就已足够, 我不需要你
<34-9,House>If waking up in the morning is enough,I don't need U.

662
00:40:56,930 --> 00:40:59,260
<34-10,Foreman>我能承受住
<34-10,Foreman>I can live with that.
