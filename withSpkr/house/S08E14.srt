5
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:16,290
<1-2,Will>肯定比包装纸好看多了
<1-2,Will>I'm sure it's prettier than the paper.

6
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,160
<1-2,Will>这么一颗小钻石

38
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,690
<2-2,Man>在他的血检结果出来前我们是这么想的
<2-2,Man>Which is what we thought until his blood tests showed

00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:35,750
<4-1,Adams>可是结果显示血糖水平尚可且酮体阴性
<4-1,Adams>a controlled sugar level and no ketones.

40
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,420
<4-2,Park>可能是由吸毒引起的
<4-2,Park>It could be caused by drug abuse.

41
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,700
<4-3,Taub>毒理分析显示他没有吸毒
<4-3,Taub>His tox scenens were clean.

<4-4,House>你个谎话精

45
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,770
<5-1,House>这次
<5-1,House>This time.

46
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,330
<5-1,House>是我原最铁哥们

00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:54,790
<5-1,House>在我们说话间在我背后捅我一刀
<5-1,House>stabbing me in the back as we speak.

49
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:55,990
<5-1,House>你人在哪里啊
<5-1,House>Where exactly are you?

50

<6-3,Adams>为什么会...
<6-3,Adams>Why would any--

54
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:02,880
<6-4,Chase>也不重要
<6-4,Chase>And...don't really care.

56
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,620
<6-4,Chase>定向障碍可能是精神分裂症表现

57
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,530
<6-5,Taub>做过精神病鉴定了

63
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,560
<6-7,House>还有  要是有人深入寻问
<6-7,House>Also, if anyone should further happen to ask,

64
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,830
<6-7,House>就说我去年和一群无国界医生
<6-7,House>I spent the whole last year in Africa

65
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:25,010
<6-7,House>待在非洲

66
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:26,530

<7-2,Taub>我记得

<8-1,Melissa>Do you want me to pick up the braille writer

76
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,940
<8-1,Melissa>和笔记本电脑拿来
<8-1,Melissa>and laptop from your apartment?

77
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,870
<8-2,Will>我可没打算在这长住
<8-2,Will>I don't plan on being here that long.

78
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,000
<8-2,Will>我昨天没吃午饭
<8-2,Will>I didn't eat lunch yesterday.

79
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,960
<8-2,Will>可能就是饿昏了
<8-2,Will>I probably just fainted.

80
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,720
<8-3,Park>或者是癫痫发作
<8-3,Park>Or had an epileptic seizure.

81
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,460
<8-4,Chase>这是一种可能
<8-4,Chase>Which is only one possibility.

82
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,950
<8-4,Chase>我是奇斯医生
<8-4,Chase>I'm Dr. Chase.

83
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:17,620
<8-4,Chase>我们想和你单独聊聊你的病情
<8-4,Chase>Uh, we'd like to discuss your case with you privately.

84
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,360
<8-5,Melissa>我是他女朋友  能留下来听吗
<8-5,Melissa>I'm his girlfriend. Is it all right If I stay for this?

85
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,690
<8-6,Will>梅丽莎可以留下
<8-6,Will>Melissa can stay.

86
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:22,570
<8-6,Will>我以前从来没有发作过癫痫
<8-6,Will>And I've never had a seizure before in my life.

87
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:23,340
<8-7,Chase>可能是轻微型癫痫
<8-7,Chase>They can be mild,

88
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,840
<8-7,Chase>表现为无法集中注意力
<8-7,Chase>like a loss of concentration

89
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,030
<8-7,Chase>或是肌肉抖动
<8-7,Chase>or a muscle tremor.

90
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,840
<8-8,Park>通常病人家属会比病人自己先注意到这些
<8-8,Park>A lot of times a family member notices before the patient does.

91
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,760
<8-8,Park>顺便说一下  我是朴克医生
<8-8,Park>I'm Dr. Park, by the way.

92
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:35,330
<8-8,Park>我1米58  亚裔  如果你要摸我的脸
<8-8,Park>I'm 5'2", Asian, and I'm totally cool with it

93
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:36,920
<8-8,Park>我不会介意的
<8-8,Park>if you wanna feel my face.

94
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,480
<8-9,Melissa>只有电影里的盲人才会那么做
<8-9,Melissa>Blind people only do that in movies.

95
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,340
<8-10,Will>但你听起来人很好  所以如果你想让我摸
<8-10,Will>But you sound nice, so if you want me to...

96
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:46,270
<8-11,Chase>她的意思是  也许你没感觉癫痫发作
<8-11,Chase>Her point was, you may not have realized you having a seizure,

97
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:48,160
<8-11,Chase>但是可能你女朋友注意到了
<8-11,Chase>but maybe your girlfriend has.

98
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:48,920
<8-11,Chase>没有
<8-11,Chase>No.

99
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:52,180
<8-12,Melissa>我已经有五个月没见他了
<8-12,Melissa>But I--I haven't seen him for the last five months.

100
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,040
<8-12,Melissa>我们暂时分开了一段时间
<8-12,Melissa>We were on a break.

101
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,570
<8-13,Will>就像《老友记》里的瑞秋和罗斯那样
<8-13,Will>Like Rachel and Ross on Friends.

102
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:00,770
<8-13,Will>我从没看过那部剧  但听说很不错
<8-13,Will>Never seen the show myself, but I hear it's good.

103
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:05,980
<8-13,Will>这玩笑让我那些盲人朋友乐翻了
<8-13,Will>That joke usually kills my blind friends.

104
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,080
<8-14,Melissa>威尔  你的病是件很严肃的事
<8-14,Melissa>Will, this is serious.

105
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:07,810
<8-14,Melissa>不是的
<8-14,Melissa>No, it's not,

106
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,210
<8-15,Will>因为我压根没有癫痫
<8-15,Will>since I don't have epilepsy.

107
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,390
<8-15,Will>我得时刻注意
<8-15,Will>I have to pay attention to every signal

108
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,800
<8-15,Will>身体发出或者接受到的任何信号
<8-15,Will>my body sends or receives,

109
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,700
<8-15,Will>否则我就会睡在垃圾堆里了
<8-15,Will>or I end up taking a dirt nap.

110
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,070
<8-15,Will>你们真的以为我会不知道自己有没有癫痫吗
<8-15,Will>You don't think I'd know if I was having seizures?

111
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,500
<8-15,Will>可能只是血糖偏低了
<8-15,Will>It's probably just low blood sugar.

112
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,740
<8-16,Chase>如果是那样的话  你应该
<8-16,Chase>If that's true, then you shouldn't have

113
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,230
<8-16,Chase>能顺利通过检查
<8-16,Chase>a problem passing our test.

114
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:27,330
<9-1,Blythe>他过得怎么样  詹姆斯  你说实话
<9-1,Blythe>How is he, James, really?

115
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:29,660
<9-2,Wilson>他很好  我很久都没见他这么好了
<9-2,Wilson>He's better than I've seen him in a long time.

116
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,440
<9-3,Blythe>他幸福吗
<9-3,Blythe>Is he happy?

117
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:34,570
<9-4,Wilson>没事的
<9-4,Wilson>It's ok.

118
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:38,480
<9-5,Blythe>他一直就是个很复杂的孩子
<9-5,Blythe>He's always been a complicated child.

119
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,150
<9-6,Wilson>你最近进过医院吗
<9-6,Wilson>Were you in the hospital recently?

120
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,730
<9-7,Blythe>不是什么大病
<9-7,Blythe>Oh, nothing serious.

121
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:46,110
<9-7,Blythe>我昨天刚移除掉几颗痣
<9-7,Blythe>I just had a few moles removed yesterday

122
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:48,080
<9-7,Blythe>都忘了还戴着这个东西
<9-7,Blythe>and forgot I even had it on.

123
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:54,810
<9-7,Blythe>如果格雷戈突然提前从会上回来了
<9-7,Blythe>Look, if Greg happens to get back early from the conference,

124
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:59,210
<9-7,Blythe>之后三天我都在城里的酒店住着
<9-7,Blythe>I'm staying at a hotel in town for the next three days.

125
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,670
<9-7,Blythe>我希望他能给我打个电话
<9-7,Blythe>I would like him to call me.

126
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,620
<9-8,Wilson>我会转告他的
<9-8,Wilson>I will pass it on.

127
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,650
<9-8,Wilson>谢谢
<9-8,Wilson>Thank you.

128
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,810
<9-9,Blythe>你们这能不能续杯
<9-9,Blythe>Um, do you think that they would mind

129
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,790
<9-9,Blythe>好带着路上喝
<9-9,Blythe>if I got a refill for the road?

130
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,400
<9-10,Wilson>-可以啊  -好的
<9-10,Wilson>- Not at all. - Good.

132
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,810
<10-1,Adams>给低频音
<10-1,Adams>Not seeing any seizure actityty

133
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:41,890
<10-1,Adams>未见癫痫发作征象
<10-1,Adams>in response to low frequency sounds.

134
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:43,490
<10-1,Adams>现在给中频音
<10-1,Adams>I'm starting him on mid-range.

135
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,540
<10-2,Taub>你瞧见他女朋友了吗
<10-2,Taub>Have you seen his girlfriend?

136
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:47,670
<10-2,Taub>相当漂亮
<10-2,Taub>Extremely hot.

137
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,700
<10-3,Adams>盲人就不能有个漂亮女友吗
<10-3,Adams>Blind people can't have attractive girlfriends?

138
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,870
<10-4,Taub>我不是这意思
<10-4,Taub>Not my point.

139
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,790
<10-4,Taub>他竟然劝他女友
<10-4,Taub>He actually convinced her to go for

140
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:55,210
<10-4,Taub>和自己暂时分开
<10-4,Taub>the whole relationship break thing.

141
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:57,010
<10-5,Adams>你怎么知道那不是她的意思
<10-5,Adams>How do you know it wasn't her idea?

142
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:58,350
<10-6,Taub>因为她回到他身边了
<10-6,Taub>Because she's back with him.

143
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,510
<10-6,Taub>女人提出分手是因为她们想分手
<10-6,Taub>Women suggest a break when they wanna break up.

144
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:02,850
<10-6,Taub>而男人要分手是因为他们想
<10-6,Taub>Men do it because they wanna have sex

145
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:04,390
<10-6,Taub>在安定生活前和别的女人们滚床单
<10-6,Taub>with other women before they settle down.

146
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08,200
<10-7,Adams>他们现在结婚有点早  你说呢
<10-7,Adams>They're a little young to get married, don't you think?

147
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,570
<10-8,Taub>我结婚时就这么大
<10-8,Taub>I was their age when I did.

148
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,010
<10-8,Taub>我明白你的意思了
<10-8,Taub>I see your point.

149
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,930
<10-9,Adams>他在抽搐
<10-9,Adams>He's seizing.

150
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:18,030
<10-9,Adams>音频在三百赫兹
<10-9,Adams>Sound frequency's at 300 hertz.

151
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:20,480
<10-10,Taub>不是癫痫
<10-10,Taub>It's not a seizure.

152
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,310
<10-10,Taub>脑电图无异常波形
<10-10,Taub>He's not spiking on his EEG.

153
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,710
<10-11,Taub>他没有呼吸了
<10-11,Taub>He's not moving air.

154
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:28,170
<10-11,Taub>可能被什么东西呛住了
<10-11,Taub>I think he's choking on something.

155
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:31,380
<10-12,Adams>有血
<10-12,Adams>Blood.

156
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,160
<10-12,Adams>我没看见有什么阻挡物啊
<10-12,Adams>I don't see any blockage.

157
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,170
<10-13,Taub>帮我给他挪个地方
<10-13,Taub>Help me move him.

158
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,920
<10-14,Adams>放松  呼吸
<10-14,Adams>Just relax and breathe.

159
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,730
<10-15,Will>这是什么
<10-15,Will>What--what are these?

160
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:03,990
<11-1,Taub>下颚三颗牙齿脱落
<11-1,Taub>Three teeth detached from his jawbone

161
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,400
<11-1,Taub>并卡在咽部
<11-1,Taub>and lodged in his throat.

162
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,180
<11-1,Taub>他差点被呛死
<11-1,Taub>He almost choked to death on them.

163
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:07,830
<11-1,Taub>环境因素呢
<11-1,Taub>Environmental?

164
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,180
<11-2,Chase>可能是重金属中毒
<11-2,Chase>Could be heavy metal poisoning

165
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:11,040
<11-2,Chase>或暴露于辐射中
<11-2,Chase>or radiation exposure.

166
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,890
<11-3,Taub>那他就不会是唯一的受害者
<11-3,Taub>Then he wouldn't be the only one.

167
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:13,730
<11-3,Taub>他是名会计
<11-3,Taub>He's an accountant who works

168
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:15,770
<11-3,Taub>与五十多个人在同一楼层工作
<11-3,Taub>on the same floor with 50 other people.

169
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:18,290
<11-4,Park>也许是他女朋友下的毒
<11-4,Park>Maybe his girlfriend poisoned him.

170
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:23,110
<11-4,Park>豪斯就会赞成这个猜测
<11-4,Park>House usually thinks that's a good guess.

171
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:25,840
<11-4,Park>她肯定很生气  而且毫无自尊
<11-4,Park>And she's gotta be pissed off and have low self-esteem.

172
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,910
<11-4,Park>不然的话
<11-4,Park>Why else would she

173
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,530
<11-4,Park>她为何会允许他去勾搭其他女人
<11-4,Park>give him a free pass to pork other women?

174
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:29,850
<11-5,House>因为他拄拐
<11-5,House>Because he's handicapped.

175
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:31,490
<11-5,House>女人会对我们同情心泛滥
<11-5,House>Women feel sorry for us.

176
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:32,560
<11-5,House>我的拐杖就是免罪牌
<11-5,House>This cane is tail bait.

177
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,080
<11-6,Adams>你现在在哪呢
<11-6,Adams>Where are you now?

178
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,410
<11-7,Chase>你还指望他会回答吗
<11-7,Chase>Expect an actual answer this time?

179
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:37,440
<11-8,Dominika>嗨  大家好
<11-8,Dominika>Hi, guys.

180
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,690
<11-8,Dominika>豪斯的母亲离开了吗
<11-8,Dominika>Was wondering if House's mother left yet.

181
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:40,710
<11-8,Dominika>他不让我去医...
<11-8,Dominika>He won't let me go to a hos--

182
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:42,910
<11-9,House>不是环境原因  是牙周炎
<11-9,House>It's not environmental, it's periodontitis.

183
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:45,350
<11-10,Chase>口腔感染不能解释他的定向障碍
<11-10,Chase>An oral infection doesn't explain his disorientation

184
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:47,300
<11-10,Chase>以及幻听
<11-10,Chase>and auditory hallucinations.

185
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,070
<11-11,House>孩子都在笑你
<11-11,House>They're laughing because they know

186
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,830
<11-11,House>他们都知道糖尿病会使病情恶化
<11-11,House>diabetes exacerbates the condition.

187
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,090
<11-12,Taub>可能引发全身表现
<11-12,Taub>It could progress to a systemic disease.

188
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:55,320
<11-12,Taub>细菌播散至其他器官
<11-12,Taub>The bacteria spread and affect other organs.

189
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,310
<11-13,House>比如大脑
<11-13,House>Like his brain.

190
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,480
<11-13,House>给他用广谱抗生素
<11-13,House>Start him on broad spectrum antibiotics

191
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,700
<11-13,House>再请口腔科会诊
<11-13,House>and book him an appointment with a periodontist.

192
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:04,810
<11-14,Park>他现在假孩子都要有了吗
<11-14,Park>He has fake children now, too?

193
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,500
<12-1,Dominika>你觉得我入不了你母亲的眼吗
<12-1,Dominika>You think I'm not good enough for your mother.

194
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,030
<12-2,House>别在孩子面前吵  亲爱的
<12-2,House>Not in front of the kids, honey.

195
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,630
<12-2,House>再加几只飞虫  添上一两头傻羊
<12-2,House>Hey, add a couple of flies, toss in a dead goat or two,

196
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:22,640
<12-2,House>你就能胜出了
<12-2,House>we might have a winner.

197
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:25,380
<12-2,House>她走了吗
<12-2,House>She gone?

198
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:26,690
<12-2,House>走了
<12-2,House>Yeah.

199
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:28,990
<12-3,Wilson>我们真的要谈一谈
<12-3,Wilson>We really need to talk.

200
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,770
<12-3,Wilson>好吧
<12-3,Wilson>Okay.

201
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,680
<12-4,House>放下蜡笔
<12-4,House>Crayons down.

202
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,420
<12-4,House>想拿零花钱  就排好队
<12-4,House>Line up if you wanna get paid.

203
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:42,110
<12-4,House>这将是我唯一一次成功地骗过我妈
<12-4,House>It's the only time I ever successfully lie to my mom.

204
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:43,790
<12-4,House>要精心准备
<12-4,House>Through the elaborate preparations

205
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,140
<12-4,House>还要有道具
<12-4,House>and props.

206
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,750
<12-5,House>你你你
<12-5,House>Hey, hey, hey.

207
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,400
<12-5,House>我说了不要变形金刚  小滑头
<12-5,House>I said no transformers, slick.

208
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,910
<12-5,House>待在这  直到警报解除
<12-5,House>Stay here until the coast is clear.

209
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,200
<12-5,House>好吧
<12-5,House>Fine.

210
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:02,310
<12-5,House>不过今晚你睡沙发
<12-5,House>But you sleep on couch tonight.

211
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,650
<13-1,Wilson>你跟她一起住吗
<13-1,Wilson>You sleeping with her now?

212
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,610
<13-2,House>以防移民局的人翻窗进来检查
<13-2,House>Just in case an I.N.S. guy comes in through the window.

213
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,400
<13-4,House>她也不相信
<13-4,House>Yeah, she didn't buy it either.

214
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,280
<13-5,Wilson>你要找你母亲谈一谈
<13-5,Wilson>You need to talk to your mother.

215
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:12,820
<13-6,House>等我准备好
<13-6,House>When I'm ready.

216
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,300
<13-6,House>还要搞本假护照
<13-6,House>Still need to get a fake passport,

217
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,460
<13-6,House>假照片  还要借个艾滋病病人
<13-6,House>doctored photos, maybe a case of AIDS.

218
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,880
<13-7,Wilson>她病了  豪斯
<13-7,Wilson>She's sick, House.

219
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,870
<13-8,House>她自己说的吗
<13-8,House>Did she say that?

220
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:25,570
<13-9,Wilson>她戴着住院病人手腕标识
<13-9,Wilson>She was wearing a hospital admission bracelet

221
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:28,980
<13-9,Wilson>随身带着本关于如何渡过癌症晚期的书
<13-9,Wilson>and carrying around a book on dealing with terminal cancer.

222
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,460
<39-8,Wilson>我很抱歉
<39-8,Wilson>I'm sorry.

223
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:40,250
<39-8,Wilson>接下来三天  她都住在格兰德酒店
<39-8,Wilson>She's staying at The Grand for the next three days.

224
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:55,200
<14-1,Park>抗生素可控制感染
<14-1,Park>The antibiotics will stop the infection

225
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,150
<14-1,Park>阻止其播散
<14-1,Park>from spreading further.

226
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,980
<14-2,Taub>明天牙周病医生会给你一番说教
<14-2,Taub>And I'll spare you the lecture you'll get

227
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,240
<14-2,Taub>我就不再折磨你了
<14-2,Taub>from the periodontist tomorrow,

228
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,120
<14-2,Taub>但你确实需要注意口腔卫生
<14-2,Taub>but you need to practice better oral hygiene.

229
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:05,910
<14-3,Will>你们是说我会病成这样是因为
<14-3,Will>So are you guys saying this is happening because, what,

230
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,870
<14-3,Will>-我总不用牙线吗  -我这么说也许没帮助
<14-3,Will>- I didn't floss enough? - Probably didn't help,

231
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:10,530
<14-4,Park>但糖尿病病人易受此类感染
<14-4,Park>but diabetics are prone to this type of infection.

232
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:11,850
<14-5,Melissa>这么久以来  他睡觉前
<14-5,Melissa>Half the time, he doesn't even bother

233
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:13,770
<14-5,Melissa>常常连衣服都懒得脱
<14-5,Melissa>getting undressed before he goes to bed.

234
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:15,180
<14-5,Melissa>这就不难想象  你大概总是
<14-5,Melissa>Can only imagine how many times you've skipped

235
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,640
<14-5,Melissa>忘记刷牙  自从...
<14-5,Melissa>brushing your teeth since we...

236
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:20,050
<14-5,Melissa>对不起
<14-5,Melissa>Sorry.

237
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,500
<14-5,Melissa>我并不是想说教  宝贝
<14-5,Melissa>I don't mean to lecture you, babe.

238
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,070
<14-6,Will>但我想你是对的
<14-6,Will>Well, I guess you're right.

239
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,840
<14-6,Will>你一整天都没吃东西
<14-6,Will>Look, you haven't eaten anything all day.

240
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,020
<14-6,Will>要不你先去填填肚子吧
<14-6,Will>Why don't you go grab a bite?

241
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,190
<14-6,Will>我没事
<14-6,Will>I'll be fine.

242
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:36,650
<14-7,Melissa>好的  那我们一小时后再见
<14-7,Melissa>All right, well, I'll see you in an hour, okay?

243
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:38,250
<14-8,Will>除非我先看见你[好不让你见着]
<14-8,Will>Not if I see you first.

244
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,920
<14-8,Will>我在想  你们能不能帮我个忙
<14-8,Will>I was wondering if I could ask you guys for a favor.

245
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,600
<14-8,Will>我急需我的笔记本和盲点打字机
<14-8,Will>I really need my laptop and braille writer,

246
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,460
<14-8,Will>而我不能让梅丽莎帮我去拿
<14-8,Will>and I can't ask Melissa to get them for me.

247
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,260
<14-9,Taub>为什么不能
<14-9,Taub>Why not?

248
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,480
<14-9,Taub>因为...
<14-9,Taub>Because...

249
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:57,000
<14-10,Will>我想让你们帮我把这个藏好
<14-10,Will>I want you to put this someplace safe.

250
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,610
<14-11,Park>好美啊
<14-11,Park>It's beautiful.

251
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:04,940
<14-12,Will>人们总是说钻石很美
<14-12,Will>People always say diamonds are beautiful.

252
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,590
<14-12,Will>但对我来说  它们冷冰冰的
<14-12,Will>But to me they just feel cold.

253
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:07,830
<14-12,Will>边缘非常尖锐
<14-12,Will>They have really sharp edges.

254
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:11,150
<14-13,Park>我猜你说服她暂时分开  是件好事
<14-13,Park>I guess convincing her to take a break was a good thing.

255
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,520
<14-13,Park>分开是她的主意
<14-13,Park>Well, the break was her idea.

256
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,810
<14-14,Will>梅丽莎是我唯一一个交往过的女孩
<14-14,Will>Melissa is the only girl I've ever dated.

257
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:17,520
<14-14,Will>她希望在我们更进一步前
<14-14,Will>She wanted me to be sure before we

258
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,770
<14-14,Will>我能确定自己的心
<14-14,Will>took the next step.

259
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:31,520
<15-1,Park>你在干什么
<15-1,Park>What are you doing?

260
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,530
<15-3,Park>来都来了
<15-3,Park>We're here.

261
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:33,710
<15-2,Taub>最好顺便搜查一番
<15-2,Taub>We might as well search the place

262
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:36,410
<15-2,Taub>以防牙周炎这个诊断是错的
<15-2,Taub>in case we're wrong about periodontitis.

263
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,230
<15-1,Park>你又在干什么
<15-1,Park>What are you doing?

264
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,840
<15-3,Park>来都来了  顺便吃点
<15-3,Park>We're here, might as well eat.

265
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,020
<15-4,Taub>你这是在偷一个瞎子的食物
<15-4,Taub>You're stealing food from a blind man?

266
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,080
<15-5,Park>我们是在帮他  这是他欠我的
<15-5,Park>We're doing him a favor. He owes me.

267
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:52,710
<15-6,Taub>根据你那"毫无自尊"理论
<15-6,Taub>I take it from your low self-esteem theory

268
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:56,070
<15-6,Taub>我猜你曾有类似的分手经历
<15-6,Taub>you have some experience with relationship breaks?

269
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,430
<15-6,Taub>怎么回事
<15-6,Taub>What happened?

270
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:04,830
<15-7,Park>他说服我暂时分开  然后...
<15-7,Park>He talked me into it, then...

271
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,400
<15-7,Park>就和我的三个朋友上了床
<15-7,Park>slept with three of my friends.

272
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,560
<15-7,Park>然后又甩了我
<15-7,Park>Then dumped my ass.

273
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,630
<15-7,Park>大学时的男友
<15-7,Park>College boyfriend.

274
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:14,290
<15-7,Park>以为他是我的真爱
<15-7,Park>Thought he was the love of my life.

275
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:16,780
<15-8,Taub>那你为何要同意分开呢
<15-8,Taub>Then why agree to a break?

276
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:19,420
<15-9,Park>我当时没什么自尊
<15-9,Park>My self-esteem wasn't as high back then.

277
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:22,440
<15-10,Taub>没有人有
<15-10,Taub>No one's is.

278
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,110
<15-10,Taub>恶
<15-10,Taub>Oh!

<15-11,Park>Sugar free!

280
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,130
<15-11,Park>难吃死了
<15-11,Park>Disgusting!

281

<15-12,Taub>我去检查浴室  你继续找零食吧
<15-12,Taub>I'll check the bathroom. You keep check the snacks.

<16-1,Blythe>格雷戈
<16-1,Blythe>Greg.

283
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,540
<16-2,House>抱歉我没先打声招呼
<16-2,House>Sorry I didn't call first.

284
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:04,270
<16-2,House>我刚从会上飞回来
<16-2,House>I just flew back from my conference.

<16-4,House>给我你的医疗记录
<16-4,House>I need your medical records

287
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:10,780
<16-4,House>以及主治医生的姓名
<16-4,House>and the name of your primary physician.

288
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:15,240
<16-4,House>你记得贝尔先生吧
<16-4,House>Well, you remember Mr. Bell.

289
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:18,400
<17-1,Blythe>即便不记得  这下也不会忘了
<17-1,Blythe>Well, if I didn't, I will now.

290
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,250
<17-2,House>你并没有病危
<17-2,House>You're not dying?

291
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:27,420
<17-3,Blythe>让詹姆斯看到癌症的书
<17-3,Blythe>I, uh...I may have mislead James

292
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,650
<17-3,Blythe>可能是我误导他了
<17-3,Blythe>by letting him see a book on cancer.

293
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:31,670
<17-4,Thomas>但是我们希望的是
<17-4,Thomas>We did, however, have some expectations

294
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,490
<17-4,Thomas>你会先打个电话
<17-4,Thomas>that you might call first.

295
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:34,640
<17-4,Thomas>是啊
<17-4,Thomas>Yeah.

296
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:41,960
<17-5,Blythe>我没设想你会通过这样的方式知道
<17-5,Blythe>This isn't how I envisioned you finding out.

297
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,810
<17-5,Blythe>我和贝尔先生  我们
<17-5,Blythe>Mr. Bell and I, we're...

298
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:46,690
<17-6,House>在做爱  我懂的
<17-6,House>Having sex, got it.

299
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:49,240
<17-7,Thomas>还结婚了
<17-7,Thomas>Getting married. Also.

300
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,910
<17-8,Blythe>我们希望你是第一个知道的
<17-8,Blythe>We wanted you to be the first to know.

<18-1,Chase>注射十毫克地西泮
<18-1,Chase>I need 10 milligrams of benzodiazepine.

302
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:00,510
<18-2,Adams>帮我压住他
<18-2,Adams>Help me hold him down.

303
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:14,830
<18-2,Adams>我要将癫痫重新写上白板
<18-2,Adams>I'm putting epilepsy back on the table.

304
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,310
<19-1,Adams>我要把它去掉
<19-1,Adams>And I'm taking it off because

305
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:17,650
<19-2,Chase>因为解释不了他为什么掉牙齿
<19-2,Chase>it doesn't explain losing his teeth.

306
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:18,610
<19-3,Taub>病人患有糖尿病
<19-3,Taub>The kid's diabetic.

307
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:20,880
<19-3,Taub>可能确实患有牙周炎但与病情无关
<19-3,Taub>The periodontitis could be real but completely unrelated.

308
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,470
<19-4,Chase>还真是巧啊  你觉得呢  豪斯
<19-4,Chase>Coincidence. Buying that, House?

<19-5,House>Until I hear something that takes my mind off

310
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:30,460
<19-5,House>令人蛋疼的精神创伤  再说吧
<19-5,House>the jurassic schlong that I was traumatized by this afternoon.

311
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,250
<19-6,Park>我知道病人是怎么了
<19-6,Park>I know what's wrong with the patient.

00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:35,520
<19-6,Park>违禁毒品  酸中毒
<19-6,Park>Illegal drugs. Some kind of acid.

00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,140
<19-7,Taub>他的毒理检查显示没问题
<19-7,Taub>His tox screens were clean.

314
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,520
<19-8,Park>他的公寓就不是那么回事了
<19-8,Park>His apartment wasn't.

315
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:40,760
<19-9,Taub>我们没有发现毒品啊
<19-9,Taub>We didn't find any drugs.

316
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,730
<19-10,Park>那为什么我现在嗨了呢
<19-10,Park>Then why am I completely tripping balls right now?

317
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:49,370
<19-10,Park>伙计们  我真的很害怕
<19-10,Park>I'm seriously freaking out here, guys.

<19-10,Park>你们看不出来吗
<19-10,Park>Can't you tell?

319
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:54,200
<19-11,Chase>你看着和平时没什么两样啊
<19-11,Chase>You pretty much look the same as you always do.

320
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,590
<19-12,House>把眼镜摘掉
<19-12,House>Take your glasses off.

321

00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,340
<19-17,Taub>冰淇淋和软糖
<19-17,Taub>at the patient's apartment.

334
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:06,290
<19-17,Taub>其中肯定有一样被下了药
<19-17,Taub>One of 'em must have been dosed with it.

<20-4,Chase>We need to know where you bought it

348
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,610
<20-4,Chase>以便我们分析其中的成分

<20-11,Will>她会吓傻掉的
<20-11,Will>She'll only freak out.

377
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:00,720
<21-4,House>不是那位逝者老爹  是我生父
<21-4,House>Not the dead dad, the biological dad.

378
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,740
<21-4,House>就是在逝者老爹葬礼上指给你看的那人
<21-4,House>The one I pointed out to you at fake father's funeral.

379
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:05,800
<21-4,House>好吧
<21-4,House>Huh.

380
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,780
<21-5,Wilson>你确定吗
<21-5,Wilson>Are you sure?

381
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,650
<21-5,Wilson>你唯一的证据就是你十二岁时
<21-5,Wilson>Your only evidence is that birthmark you saw

382
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,030
<21-5,Wilson>看到的胎记
<21-5,Wilson>when you were 12.

383
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,330
<21-6,House>好吧  我现在看到了第二个胎记
<21-6,House>Well, now I've seen two.

384
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:20,350
<21-6,House>好消息是我做不了多久的
<21-6,House>Good news is I won't technically be a bastard

385
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:21,350
<21-6,House>"混蛋"了
<21-6,House>much longer.

386
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:24,470
<21-6,House>我们即将组成一个畸形的家庭
<21-6,House>We're gonna be one big crappy family.

387
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:29,260
<21-7,Wilson>好吧  这  这是个好消息
<21-7,Wilson>Well, that's-- that's great news.

388
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:30,980
<21-7,Wilson>你母亲不会再孑然一身了
<21-7,Wilson>Your mother won't be alone anymore,

389
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:33,240
<21-7,Wilson>你也可以了解那个人了
<21-7,Wilson>and you can finally get to know the guy.

390
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,610
<21-8,House>是啊  这倒也是
<21-8,House>Yes, that is one option.

391
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,640
<21-9,Wilson>你难道就一点不好奇吗
<21-9,Wilson>Are you saying you're not even curious?

392
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,190
<21-9,Wilson>你知道我怎么看吗
<21-9,Wilson>You want to know what I think?

393
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:43,030
<21-10,House>我想你知道答案的吧
<21-10,House>I think you know the answer to that question.

394
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:45,410
<21-11,Wilson>你对你母亲避而不见是因为
<21-11,Wilson>You avoid your mother because she's the one person

395
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:47,060
<21-11,Wilson>你唯一在乎的就是你母亲的看法
<21-11,Wilson>whose opinion you actually care about.

396
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,670
<21-12,House>如果真是这么回事的话  你就该闭嘴了
<21-12,House>If that was true, you'd have every reason to shut up.

397
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:51,750
<21-12,House>我对我母亲避而不见是因为她很无趣
<21-12,House>I avoid my mother because she's boring.

398
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,550
<21-13,Wilson>所以你对坐牢和与陌生人结婚
<21-13,Wilson>That's why you've been so open and honest

399
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:56,250
<21-13,Wilson>抱着开放坦然的态度
<21-13,Wilson>about prison and marrying a complete stranger.

400
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,650
<21-14,House>即便我在意她的看法
<21-14,House>Even if I care what she thinks,

401
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,040
<21-14,House>我为什么要在意精子捐献者的看法呢
<21-14,House>why would I care what some sperm donor does?

402
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,240
<21-15,Wilson>他的书你读了三遍
<21-15,Wilson>You read the guy's book about three times.

403
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,200
<21-16,House>陈芝麻烂谷子的事了
<21-16,House>Years ago.

404
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,940
<21-16,House>因为书写得很差才要看了三遍
<21-16,House>It took three times because it was so badly written.

405
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:09,390
<21-17,Park>我明白了
<21-17,Park>Oh, I get it.

406
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:12,340
<21-17,Park>第二个胎记在他的小弟弟上  对吧
<21-17,Park>The second birthmark was on his penis, right?

407
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:17,660
<22-1,Adams>他是个混蛋
<22-1,Adams>He's a dick.

408
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,070
<22-2,Chase>你在豪斯手下工作了几个月了
<22-2,Chase>You've been working for House for months

409
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:20,410
<22-2,Chase>现在才意识到
<22-2,Chase>and just now realized

410
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,410
<22-2,Chase>残疾人也可能是混蛋  是不是太迟钝了
<22-2,Chase>that disabled people can also be dicks?

411
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:25,060
<22-3,Adams>他这么对那个姑娘是不公平的
<22-3,Adams>What he's doing now to that girl isn't fair.

412
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,590
<22-4,Chase>分手是她提出来的
<22-4,Chase>The break was her idea.

413
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:28,670
<22-5,Adams>她现在觉得他们俩又重归于好了
<22-5,Adams>And now she thinks they're back together.

414
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:32,740
<22-6,Chase>他是个又怕  又病  又瞎的孩子
<22-6,Chase>He's a scared, sick, blind kid

415
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,030
<22-6,Chase>不想独自住院
<22-6,Chase>who doesn't want to be alone.

416
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:35,570
<22-6,Chase>你难道不明白吗
<22-6,Chase>You really don't get that?

417
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:37,030
<22-7,Adams>我明白  但是
<22-7,Adams>I do, but...

418
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:41,140
<22-8,Chase>什么东西
<22-8,Chase>What is it?

419
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:45,180
<22-9,Adams>对他和朴克都不是好消息
<22-9,Adams>Not good news for him... or Park.

420
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,030
<23-1,Adams>朴克呢
<23-1,Adams>Where's Park?

421
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,920
<23-2,House>威尔森在照顾她呢
<23-2,House>Wilson's babysitting her.

422
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,980
<23-2,House>如果和她说起她可能会有永久性脑损伤
<23-2,House>Talking about the fact that she could have

423
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:03,360
<23-2,House>可能会让她乐半天呢
<23-2,House>permanent brain damage might bum her trip out a little bit.

424
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,180
<23-3,Chase>黑点并不意味着脑损伤啊
<23-3,Chase>A dark spot doesn't necessarily equal brain damage.

425
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:08,170
<23-3,Chase>可能是与他失明相关的
<23-3,Chase>It could be a congenital malformation

426
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:09,530
<23-3,Chase>先天畸形
<23-3,Chase>connected with his blindness

427
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:10,810
<23-3,Chase>或者是肿瘤
<23-3,Chase>or a tumor.

428
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,990
<23-4,House>-是血凝块  -没错
<23-4,House>- A clot. - Exactly.

429
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:15,520
<23-5,Chase>我们得再做次扫描同时注入染色剂来找出..
<23-5,Chase>We need to do another scan, but inject dye and figure out--

430
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,990
<23-6,House>我说的是血凝块
<23-6,House>I said "A clot,"

431
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:18,620
<23-6,House>不是  或是血凝块
<23-6,House>not "Or a clot."

432
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:20,520
<23-6,House>就是个血凝块
<23-6,House>It's a clot.

433
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,620
<23-6,House>形成脑静脉窦血栓
<23-6,House>Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis.

434
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,680
<23-7,Adams>对朴克来说是好消息
<23-7,Adams>Good news for Park.

435
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,560
<23-7,Adams>我从没见过这么大的血凝块
<23-7,Adams>I've never seen one present this large before.

436
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,340
<23-8,Taub>这符合症状  当血凝块较小时
<23-8,Taub>It fits. When it was smaller,

437
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,220
<23-8,Taub>导致了初期的定向障碍
<23-8,Taub>it caused his initial disorientation

438
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:30,960
<23-8,Taub>和幻觉
<23-8,Taub>and hallucinations.

439
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,820
<23-8,Taub>当血凝块变大后就导致癫痫
<23-8,Taub>As it grew larger, the seizures.

440
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:35,980
<23-9,Chase>如果不治疗就会导致脑水肿甚至死亡
<23-9,Chase>If left untreated, it leads to cerebral edema and death.

441
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,950
<23-9,Chase>但什么导致了牙齿脱落呢
<23-9,Chase>But what causes that and tooth loss?

442
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:41,250
<23-10,Adams>以及易凝血状态  红斑狼疮
<23-10,Adams>Any hyper-coagulable state. Lupus?

443
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:46,370
<23-11,House>我以白塞综合症推翻你的红斑狼疮
<23-11,House>I counter your lupus with Behcet's syndrome.

444
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:48,570
<23-12,Taub>不可能  他没表现出任何早期症状
<23-12,Taub>No, he doesn't have any of the earlier symptoms--

445
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:51,160
<23-12,Taub>色盲  视野异常或者...
<23-12,Taub>color blindness, abnormal visual fields or--

446
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,050
<23-12,Taub>我们因为他是盲人就忽略了他的眼部问题
<23-12,Taub>We've been ignoring his eyes because he's blind.

447
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:03,360
<23-13,House>如果他以前没瞎现在也瞎了
<23-13,House>Well, if he wasn't before, he would be by now.

448
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:05,550
<23-13,House>做眼部检查进行确诊
<23-13,House>Confirm with an eye exam,

449
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:07,520
<23-13,House>用肝素治疗凝血块
<23-13,House>start treatment with heparin for the clot.

450
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,840
<23-13,House>干扰素和类固醇治疗白塞综合症
<23-13,House>Interferon and steroids for the Behcet's.

451
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:12,710
<24-1,Wilson>住手  住手
<24-1,Wilson>No, no!

452
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:13,950
<24-2,Park>把我的牙齿还给我
<24-2,Park>Give me back my teeth!

453
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:15,640
<24-3,Wilson>朴克  听着  朴克
<24-3,Wilson>Park, listen. Park--

454
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,070
<24-4,Park>你个偷牙贼
<24-4,Park>You're a tooth thief!

455
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:19,030
<24-5,Wilson>不  不  住手  住手
<24-5,Wilson>No, no, no. Stop it, stop it!

456
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:22,400
<24-5,Wilson>回到沙发上去
<24-5,Wilson>Ki-ki-ki! Back on the couch.

457
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,450
<24-6,Blythe>你在对这可怜的女孩做什么
<24-6,Blythe>What are you doing to this poor girl?

458
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:26,670
<24-7,Wilson>不是看上去那样  她...
<24-7,Wilson>It's not what it looks like. She--Oh!

459
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,810
<24-7,Wilson>她因为酸中毒产生幻觉
<24-7,Wilson>She's tripping on acid.

460
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:35,130
<24-8,Thomas>上帝  你不能这么对待一个产生幻觉的人
<24-8,Thomas>Good lord, man, that's no way to treat a bad trip.

461
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,480
<24-8,Thomas>把椅子放下
<24-8,Thomas>Put the chair down.

462
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,410
<24-8,Thomas>你会伤到这个小可怜的
<24-8,Thomas>You'll end up hurting the poor wee thing.

463
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,510
<24-8,Thomas>亲爱的
<24-8,Thomas>Hello, darlin'.

464
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:46,190
<24-8,Thomas>我叫托马斯  这个美丽尤物叫布莱思
<24-8,Thomas>I'm Thomas, and this beautiful creature here is Blythe.

465
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:48,130
<24-8,Thomas>有什么我们能帮你的吗
<24-8,Thomas>Is there anything we can do to help you?

466
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,530
<24-9,Park>那只兔子偷了我的牙齿
<24-9,Park>That rabbit stole my teeth.

467
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,660
<24-10,Thomas>当然  不过我来告诉你他还干了什么
<24-10,Thomas>Of course he did, but I'll tell you what he's done.

468
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,470
<24-10,Thomas>他又把它们放了回去  现在你的牙齿比以前
<24-10,Thomas>He's put them back again, and they're twice as nice

469
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,470
<24-10,Thomas>漂亮多了
<24-10,Thomas>as they used to be.

470
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,690
<24-10,Thomas>你可以自己摸摸
<24-10,Thomas>You can feel them if you like.

471
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:03,220
<24-10,Thomas>感觉到了吗
<24-10,Thomas>See?

472
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:06,330
<24-10,Thomas>现在  让我们坐在这舒服的沙发上
<24-10,Thomas>Now, why don't we sit on this nice comfy couch,

473
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:08,640
<24-10,Thomas>来杯冰爽的饮料然后一起聊聊
<24-10,Thomas>have a nice cool drink and talk all about it.

474
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,000
<24-10,Thomas>你觉得好吗
<24-10,Thomas>Would you like that?

475
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,970
<24-11,Blythe>他对这种事有些经验
<24-11,Blythe>He's had some experience with things like this,

476
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,690
<24-11,Blythe>很久以前了
<24-11,Blythe>back in the day.

477
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:20,830
<24-12,Thomas>我记得我们俩...
<24-12,Thomas>As I recall, both of us--

478
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:23,440
<24-13,Blythe>不要在这说  亲爱的
<24-13,Blythe>Uh, not the time or the place, dear.

479
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,580
<24-14,Thomas>这就对了
<24-14,Thomas>There you are.

480
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,760
<24-14,Thomas>看  这就对了
<24-14,Thomas>See? There you are.

481
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:34,020
<24-15,Wilson>这人不可能和你有血缘关系
<24-15,Wilson>There's no way that guy's related to you.

482
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,770
<25-1,Chase>有新鲜的瘢痕形成  基底两侧隆起
<25-1,Chase>There's fresh scarring and swelling in both fundi,

483
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:46,650
<25-1,Chase>左侧还有出血  豪斯是对的
<25-1,Chase>and a bleed on the left. House was right.

484
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:48,390
<25-1,Chase>是白塞综合症
<25-1,Chase>It's Behcet's syndrome.

485
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:49,860
<25-2,Will>实话告诉我  医生
<25-2,Will>Give it to me straight, doc.

486
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:52,590
<25-2,Will>我还能再看到东西吗
<25-2,Will>Am I ever gonna see again?

487
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,970
<25-3,Chase>这有点超出我们的管辖范围了
<25-3,Chase>That's a little out of our jurisdiction.

488
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:58,430
<25-3,Chase>我们需要在你的双眼上裹上遮盖物
<25-3,Chase>We need to wrap a dressing over your eyes

489
00:23:58,430 --> 00:23:59,550
<25-3,Chase>以防止光线进入
<25-3,Chase>to keep the light out.

490
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:01,150
<25-4,Will>对我不是问题
<25-4,Will>Not really a problem for me.

491
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:03,370
<25-5,Chase>也许你看不见  但你的组织能感受到
<25-5,Chase>You might not see it, but your tissue does.

492
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:05,250
<25-5,Chase>这对消肿有会有帮助
<25-5,Chase>It'll also help with the swelling.

493
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,840
<25-5,Chase>这事就交给巧手的亚当斯医生了
<25-5,Chase>I'll leave you in Dr. Adams' capable hands.

494
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:19,060
<25-6,Will>你认为我是个混蛋  对吗
<25-6,Will>You think I'm an ass, don't you?

495
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:22,390
<25-6,Will>我能通过你的呼吸声判断出来
<25-6,Will>I can tell by your breathing.

496
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:25,180
<25-6,Will>你不是很生气就是很胖
<25-6,Will>Either you're angry or fat.

497
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:29,150
<25-7,Adams>我认为哄骗一个明显爱你
<25-7,Adams>I think it's unfair that you're leading on a woman

498
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:31,110
<25-7,Adams>关心你的女人是不公平的
<25-7,Adams>who obviously loves and cares about you.

499
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,540
<25-8,Will>我也同样爱她关心她
<25-8,Will>I love and care about her too.

500
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:36,870
<25-8,Will>我们只是没法成为一对
<25-8,Will>But we just don't work together as a couple.

501
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,820
<25-9,Adams>你得告诉她这点
<25-9,Adams>You need to tell her that.

502
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:40,550
<25-9,Adams>我会的
<25-9,Adams>I'm going to.

503
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:44,510
<25-10,Will>我只是想用正确的方式做这件事
<25-10,Will>But I just want to do it the right way.

504
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:46,260
<25-10,Will>我不想她恨我
<25-10,Will>I don't want her to hate me.

505
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:48,300
<25-11,Adams>如果她发现你给别的女人
<25-11,Adams>When she finds out you bought an engagement ring

506
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:51,520
<25-11,Adams>买了订婚戒指  那这个选项就是无稽之谈
<25-11,Adams>for another woman, that option is out the window.

507
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:53,370
<25-12,Will>本来戒指是给她的
<25-12,Will>It was gonna be for her.

508
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:55,540
<25-13,Adams>有什么变化吗
<25-13,Adams>What changed?

509
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:58,070
<25-14,Will>她告诉我我们得分开一段时间
<25-14,Will>She told me we were going on a break.

510
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:00,090
<25-14,Will>我对此甚至没有发言权
<25-14,Will>I didn't even get a say in the matter.

511
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:02,680
<25-15,Adams>她只是想让你想清楚两人的关系
<25-15,Adams>She wanted you to be sure about your relationship.

512
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:05,180
<25-15,Adams>我能想象那有多恼人
<25-15,Adams>I can see how that would be annoying.

513
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:08,550
<25-16,Will>我情愿你只是生气而已
<25-16,Will>I think I liked it better when you were just breathing angrily.

514
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:15,900
<25-16,Will>她还是把我当成在大学时遇到的那个
<25-16,Will>She still sees me as the same sheltered,

515
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,870
<25-16,Will>需要被保护的失明土包子
<25-16,Will>blind geek she met in college.

516
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:20,430
<25-16,Will>多数时候她更像我妈
<25-16,Will>Most of the time she acts more like my mother

517
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:21,620
<25-16,Will>而不是女朋友
<25-16,Will>than my girlfriend.

518
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:23,620
<25-16,Will>我想让她嫁给我
<25-16,Will>I asked her to marry me.

519
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:26,640
<25-16,Will>她却告诉我我需要先跟别人约会
<25-16,Will>She tells me I need to date somebody else first.

520
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:29,320
<25-16,Will>我更希望她直接甩了我
<25-16,Will>I'd rather she just dumped me.

521
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,220
<25-16,Will>至少我能理解
<25-16,Will>At least that I can understand.

522
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:33,130
<25-17,Adams>这么说你是被伤得太深
<25-17,Adams>So you were hurt so much

523
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:35,400
<25-17,Adams>才要娶你后来遇到的女人吗
<25-17,Adams>you had to marry the next woman you met?

524
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,980
<25-18,Will>茱莉看到的不是过去的我
<25-18,Will>Julie doesn't see me as I was,

525
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,910
<25-18,Will>而是现在的我
<25-18,Will>but for who I am now.

526
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:42,090
<25-18,Will>她相信我能够自己做决定
<25-18,Will>She trusts me to make my own decisions

527
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:43,550
<25-18,Will>并且能帮助她做一些决定
<25-18,Will>and to help her with hers.

528
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,540
<25-18,Will>我人生中第一次
<25-18,Will>For the first time in my life,

529
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:49,120
<25-18,Will>有被人需要的感觉
<25-18,Will>I have somebody who needs me...

530
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,380
<25-18,Will>而不是需要别人照顾
<25-18,Will>instead of the other way around.

531
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,030
<26-1,Blythe>她终于睡着了
<26-1,Blythe>Ah, she finally fell asleep.

532
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:05,510
<26-1,Blythe>我估计过几个小时她就会好了
<26-1,Blythe>I think she'll be fine in a couple of hours.

533
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:08,350
<26-2,House>你怎么知道如何对待酸中毒产生幻觉的人
<26-2,House>How do you know about handling a bad acid trip?

534
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:11,610
<26-2,House>你园艺俱乐部的朋友们又做实验了
<26-2,House>Friends in your gardening club been experimenting again?

535
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,650
<26-3,Blythe>我也年轻过
<26-3,Blythe>I was young once.

536
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:22,120
<26-3,Blythe>托马斯东拼西凑做的小相册
<26-3,Blythe>A little scrapbook that Thomas threw together.

537
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:26,030
<26-3,Blythe>他甚至有几张你小时候的照片
<26-3,Blythe>He even has a couple of pictures of you as a child.

538
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:29,490
<26-4,Thomas>要知道自打格雷戈出生时我就认识他了
<26-4,Thomas>And I've known Greg almost since he was born, you know.

539
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:31,250
<26-4,Thomas>我和他父亲就像兄弟一样
<26-4,Thomas>His father and I were like brothers.

540
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:33,610
<26-4,Thomas>那时候我还是海军牧师
<26-4,Thomas>I was a navy chaplain in those days.

541
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:35,940
<26-4,Thomas>不过在六十年代就离开了
<26-4,Thomas>I left the service in the late '60s.

542
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,520
<26-4,Thomas>我认为他父亲不会原谅我
<26-4,Thomas>I don't think his dad ever forgave me

543
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,340
<26-5,House>反对战争
<26-5,House>for protesting the war.

544
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:41,640
<26-4,Thomas>当然  如果他知道布莱思也被我拖下水...
<26-4,Thomas>Of course, if he knew I'd got Blythe involved...

545
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,680
<26-5,House>你反对战争吗  什么时候
<26-5,House>You protested the war? When?

546
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:44,770
<26-6,Blythe>你那时还是小孩
<26-6,Blythe>You were a child.

547
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:47,110
<26-6,Blythe>我并没有告诉你我的全部
<26-6,Blythe>I didn't share my entire schedule with you.

548
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:49,350
<26-7,Thomas>我们知道如果告诉你  你就会去告状
<26-7,Thomas>We knew if we told you, you'd tell him,

549
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:50,520
<26-7,Thomas>他就会把我们都杀了
<26-7,Thomas>and he'd kill us both.

550
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,930
<26-7,Thomas>他是海军  这是彻头彻尾的背叛
<26-7,Thomas>He was a marine. It was the ultimate betrayal.

551
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:54,400
<26-8,House>双重背叛
<26-8,House>Penultimate.

552
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,100
<26-9,Blythe>亲爱的  我想我们该回酒店了
<26-9,Blythe>Sweetheart, I think we need to get back to the hotel.

553
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,290
<26-10,Thomas>威尔森  很高兴见到你
<26-10,Thomas>Wilson, it's been a real pleasure.

554
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:08,940
<26-10,Thomas>你是对的  这样太正式了
<26-10,Thomas>You're right. Much too formal.

555
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:11,130
<26-10,Thomas>来吧  小伙子
<26-10,Thomas>Come here, lad.

556
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,810
<26-10,Thomas>我们终于是一家人了
<26-10,Thomas>We're practically family now.

557
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,130
<26-11,Blythe>孩子们晚上见
<26-11,Blythe>We'll see you boys tonight.

558
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,220
<26-11,Blythe>走好
<26-11,Blythe>Keep sharp.

559
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:24,810
<26-12,Wilson>我邀请了他们一起吃晚饭
<26-12,Wilson>I invited them out to dinner.

560
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:27,250
<26-12,Wilson>说是你的主意
<26-12,Wilson>Told them it was your idea.

561
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,360
<27-1,Melissa>吸管在这儿
<27-1,Melissa>Straw.

562
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,870
<27-1,Melissa>我知道我们达成过一致  不过问分手期间
<27-1,Melissa>I know we agreed that whatever happened on break

563
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:43,700
<27-1,Melissa>发生的事情  我不指望你
<27-1,Melissa>would stay on break, and I don't expect you

564
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,330
<27-1,Melissa>告诉我你的经历
<27-1,Melissa>to talk about yours.

565
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:48,390
<27-1,Melissa>但是我想让你知道  这期间我没和别人约会过
<27-1,Melissa>But I just want you to know that there was no one else.

566
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:52,810
<27-1,Melissa>我想你想得好苦
<27-1,Melissa>I missed you so much,

567
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:54,880
<27-1,Melissa>都几乎不怎么和朋友们见面
<27-1,Melissa>I barely even saw my own friends.

568
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,650
<27-1,Melissa>我们能合好我太高兴了
<27-1,Melissa>I'm just so glad it's finally over.

569
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:00,970
<27-1,Melissa>你没事吧
<27-1,Melissa>Are you okay?

570
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,500
<27-1,Melissa>他怎么了
<27-1,Melissa>What's happening to him?

571
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:20,190
<28-1,Melissa>他不会有事吧
<28-1,Melissa>Is he going to be okay?

572
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,530
<28-2,Taub>我要和同事们讨论下
<28-2,Taub>I'm going to need to discuss that with my colleagues.

573
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,210
<28-3,Will>我们得谈谈
<28-3,Will>We have to talk.

574
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:28,640
<28-4,Melissa>不  你需要休息
<28-4,Melissa>No, you need to rest.

575
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,230
<28-5,Will>有些事得和你说
<28-5,Will>I have to tell you about...

576
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:32,060
<28-5,Will>一些在分手期间发生的事
<28-5,Will>About what happened on break.

577
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,740
<28-6,Melissa>以后吧  你现在躺着休息...
<28-6,Melissa>Later. You just lie back and relax...

578
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,180
<28-7,Will>别说了  梅丽莎
<28-7,Will>Stop it, Melissa!

579
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,790
<28-7,Will>别对我发号施令了
<28-7,Will>Just stop telling me what I need,

580
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:41,810
<28-7,Will>就这么听我说次话行吗
<28-7,Will>and listen for once, okay?

581
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:52,200
<29-1,Adams>你感觉如何
<29-1,Adams>How are you feeling?

582
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,490
<29-2,Park>好尴尬
<29-2,Park>Embarrassed.

583
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:55,680
<29-2,Park>我还是有些分不清哪些是现实
<29-2,Park>I'm still not sure what was real

584
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,830
<29-2,Park>哪些是幻觉
<29-2,Park>or what I hallucinated.

585
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:00,290
<29-2,Park>你之前是不是想吻我
<29-2,Park>Did you try to kiss me?

586
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:03,700
<29-2,Park>那你呢
<29-2,Park>What about you?

587
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,770
<29-3,Taub>他目前情况稳定了
<29-3,Taub>He's stabilized for the moment.

588
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:07,680
<29-4,Adams>咳血
<29-4,Adams>Coughing up blood.

589
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,230
<29-4,Adams>并不代表他得的是其他疾病
<29-4,Adams>That doesn't really change anything.

590
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:11,300
<29-4,Adams>咳血是白塞氏综合症的症状之一
<29-4,Adams>Hemoptysis is a symptom of Behcet's.

591
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,900
<29-5,Taub>但是我们的治疗应该会让他好转
<29-5,Taub>Except our treatment should make him better,

592
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:13,710
<29-5,Taub>而不是恶化
<29-5,Taub>not worse.

593
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,410
<29-5,Taub>也有恶化的可能
<29-5,Taub>It could be doing both.

594
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:17,520
<29-6,Park>通过治疗  溶解他脑子里的血块
<29-6,Park>Our treatment breaks down his clot in his head,

595
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,260
<29-6,Park>这是正常情况  但是有一块血块分离出来
<29-6,Park>like it's supposed to, except a piece broke off

596
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,520
<29-6,Park>到了他肺部的动脉里
<29-6,Park>and traveled to one of his arteries in his lungs.

597
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:25,050
<29-6,Park>别的不说  我们应该增加肝素的剂量
<29-6,Park>If anything, we need to increase the Heparin

598
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:26,890
<29-6,Park>防止形成新的血块
<29-6,Park>to prevent further clots from forming.

599
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,290
<29-7,Adams>如此这样的话  如果他出现流血症状
<29-7,Adams>If we do that and he starts hemorrhaging,

600
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:29,470
<29-7,Adams>我们就无法给他止血
<29-7,Adams>we won't be able to stop the bleeding.

601
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:31,210
<29-8,House>但如果不这么做  下一个血块
<29-8,House>If we don't do that, the next clot

602
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:33,130
<29-8,House>就可能引起心脏病或者是中风
<29-8,House>could cause a heart attack or a stroke.

603
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:36,380
<29-8,House>按照朴克的做法  他至少还有活命的机会
<29-8,House>Park's way, he at least has a shot at living.

604
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:39,010
<29-8,House>给他的肺部做CT  加大肝素剂量
<29-8,House>CT his lungs to confirm, and up the dose.

605
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,280
<29-9,Taub>她年轻又漂亮  会走出低谷的
<29-9,Taub>She's young and hot. She'll bounce back.

606
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:50,870
<29-10,Park>37公斤
<29-10,Park>82 pounds.

607
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:56,590
<29-10,Park>类似的分手后我长了那么多的肉
<29-10,Park>How much weight I put on when my break ended the same way.

608
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:01,200
<29-10,Park>别人开始叫我朴太膘了
<29-10,Park>People were calling me park-ing-lot.

609
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:07,760
<30-1,Thomas>快九点了
<30-1,Thomas>Almost 9:00.

610
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,830
<30-1,Thomas>我觉得你儿子要放我们鸽子了
<30-1,Thomas>I think your boy is gonna stand us up.

611
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:12,040
<30-2,Blythe>不会的  他会来的
<30-2,Blythe>No, no, he'll be here.

612
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:14,740
<30-3,Thomas>差点就撞见我们滚床单
<30-3,Thomas>Practically walked in on us having sex.

613
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,760
<30-3,Thomas>上天啊  如果给我看到我妈干这事儿
<30-3,Thomas>God, if I saw my mother doing that,

614
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,570
<30-3,Thomas>我会把眼睛都挖出来
<30-3,Thomas>I'd claw my own eyes out.

615
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,080
<30-3,Thomas>当然啦  她远没有你性感
<30-3,Thomas>Of course, she was nowhere near as attractive as you.

616
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,690
<30-3,Thomas>事实上  她非常胖
<30-3,Thomas>Horribly fat, as a matter of fact.

617
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:27,680
<30-4,House>妈...
<30-4,House>Mother...

618
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,770
<30-4,House>我妈的炮友
<30-4,House>Guy sleeping with my mother,

619
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:33,900
<30-4,House>这位是我妻子  多米尼卡
<30-4,House>this is Dominika, my wife.

620
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,650
<30-5,Dominika>见到你真是太好了
<30-5,Dominika>It's so nice to be meeting you.

621
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:41,270
<30-5,Dominika>格雷戈里告诉我  你出生在弗吉尼亚的里士满
<30-5,Dominika>Gregory tells me that you were born in Richmond, Virginia.

622
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:45,000
<30-5,Dominika>你父亲是个裁缝  老是偷顾客的东西
<30-5,Dominika>And your father was a tailor who stole from his clients.

623
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,500
<30-6,House>是詹姆斯建议我
<30-6,House>James has persuaded me of the value

624
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,800
<30-6,House>应该对家人开诚布公  毫无保留
<30-6,House>of openness and honesty in relationships.

625
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:58,530
<31-1,Adams>残疾人我们见的多了  但是...
<31-1,Adams>We see people with disabilities all the time, but...

626
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,380
<31-1,Adams>但还是很难理解他们
<31-1,Adams>seeing and understanding aren't always the same thing.

627
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:10,410
<31-2,Chase>你是在和我说话  还是在发微博
<31-2,Chase>Are you talking to me or writing a facebook post?

628
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:13,220
<31-3,Adams>我想说的是  我们原可以早点发现
<31-3,Adams>I'm saying we should have picked up on the degeneration

629
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,510
<31-3,Adams>他眼睛的病变
<31-3,Adams>in his eyes sooner.

630
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:16,530
<31-3,Adams>却忽视了  就因为
<31-3,Adams>We ignored them because we assumed

631
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:18,320
<31-3,Adams>我们压根就没考虑盲人的眼睛
<31-3,Adams>they weren't even part of the equation.

632
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,390
<31-3,Adams>同时  我发现  从理性角度
<31-3,Adams>I also realized, intellectually,

633
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:24,290
<31-3,Adams>我能够理解残疾的痛苦
<31-3,Adams>I may understand what it means to be disabled,

634
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:26,530
<31-3,Adams>但从感性角度  我无从知晓
<31-3,Adams>but emotionally, I didn't have a clue.

635
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:28,800
<31-3,Adams>显然  他的女朋友也没体会到
<31-3,Adams>Apparently, his girlfriend didn't either.

636
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:30,760
<31-4,Chase>这么说你现在站到他的立场上了
<31-4,Chase>So you're back on his side?

637
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:33,240
<31-5,Adams>不是谁的立场  而是换个角度看问题
<31-5,Adams>It's not a side. It's a perspective.

638
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,940
<31-5,Adams>他只是希望能被当作成年人看待
<31-5,Adams>He just wants to be treated like an adult.

639
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,430
<31-5,Adams>能自主做决定
<31-5,Adams>Make his own decisions.

640
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:38,580
<31-5,Adams>我可能不完全赞同他的那些决定
<31-5,Adams>I may not agree with all of them,

641
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:41,990
<31-5,Adams>但我有什么资格去评判他啊
<31-5,Adams>but how the hell can I judge him?

642
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:45,530
<31-6,Chase>我完全赞同你的看法
<31-6,Chase>I'm sure that's exactly what disabled people want,

643
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,820
<31-6,Chase>残疾人就该被视为怪胎
<31-6,Chase>to be treated like completely foreign entities,

644
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:50,500
<31-6,Chase>无法理解  无从评判
<31-6,Chase>incapable of being judged and understood.

645
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:56,640
<31-6,Chase>朴克说对了  是有血块
<31-6,Chase>Park was right about the clot.

646
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:01,030
<31-6,Chase>希望抗凝血剂能保住他的命
<31-6,Chase>Hopefully the anticoagulants keep it from killing him.

647
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:04,730
<32-1,House>奇数夜她睡沙发
<32-1,House>She gets the couch on the odd nights,

648
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:06,270
<32-1,House>偶数夜我睡床上
<32-1,House>and I get the bed on evens.

649
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:08,900
<32-1,House>作为诈骗罪的奖励
<32-1,House>In exchange for a federal felony,

650
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,140
<32-1,House>她拿到了绿卡
<32-1,House>she gets a green card,

651
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,950
<32-1,House>我有了名女佣
<32-1,House>and I get a live-in maid.

652
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:15,410
<32-2,Thomas>太好了
<32-2,Thomas>Good for you.

653
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,520
<32-2,Thomas>我们国家的移民政策就是个天大的笑话
<32-2,Thomas>The immigration policy in this country is a travesty.

654
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:22,510
<32-2,Thomas>逼着那么美丽的姑娘为了留下来使尽骗术
<32-2,Thomas>It forces people to lie just so nice people can stay here.

655
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:25,340
<32-3,Dominika>谢谢你这么说   爸
<32-3,Dominika>Thank you...Dad.

656
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:30,310
<32-4,House>你能同意我很感激
<32-4,House>I'm grateful you approve.

657
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:36,180
<32-4,House>还要告诉你们  我去年  不在非洲
<32-4,House>You should also know that I was not in Africa the last year.

658
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:37,590
<32-5,Blythe>你进监狱了
<32-5,Blythe>You were in jail.

659
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:41,070
<32-5,Blythe>自打你搬到这边  我就开始关注
<32-5,Blythe>I've been reading the Princeton Police Blotter

660
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:42,310
<32-5,Blythe>普利斯顿的警方纪实
<32-5,Blythe>ever since you moved here.

661
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:49,490
<32-5,Blythe>恐怕我也对你说了谎
<32-5,Blythe>And I'm afraid I haven't been truthful with you either.

662
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:55,550
<32-5,Blythe>这事儿我很早以前就想告诉你了
<32-5,Blythe>And I've wanted to tell you this for a very long time.

663
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,780
<32-5,Blythe>我和托马斯...
<32-5,Blythe>Thomas and I...

664
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:03,570
<32-5,Blythe>在你父亲过世两月后就结婚了
<32-5,Blythe>We got married two months after your father passed away.

665
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:05,390
<32-7,Thomas>要知道
<32-7,Thomas>You understand,

666
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:07,630
<32-7,Thomas>我们不想让你觉得
<32-7,Thomas>we didn't want you to think we were disrespecting

667
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:09,060
<32-7,Thomas>我们对你父亲有任何的不敬
<32-7,Thomas>the memory of your father.

668
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:14,860
<32-8,House>还有其他秘密
<32-8,House>And...is there another secret

669
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,280
<32-8,House>要和我分享的吗
<32-8,House>that you want to share with me?

670
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,170
<32-9,Blythe>没了
<32-9,Blythe>No.

671
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:24,420
<32-10,House>再没有和我人生
<32-10,House>There's nothing you think might be relevant

672
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,770
<32-10,House>有关的事情了吗
<32-10,House>to my life?

673
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:28,760
<32-11,Thomas>-比如说什么呢  -我不知道
<32-11,Thomas>- Like...What? - I don't know.

674
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,130
<32-12,House>我记得
<32-12,House>Just off the top of my head,

675
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:33,130
<32-12,House>我给我爸做过DNA测试
<32-12,House>something like I DNA-tested my dad

676
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:35,230
<32-12,House>发现他不是我的生父
<32-12,House>and found that he was not my biological father.

677
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:36,080
<32-12,House>你才是
<32-12,House>You are.

678
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,420
<32-13,Thomas>那不可能
<32-13,Thomas>That's impossible.

679
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:42,080
<32-14,House>人会说谎  但是胎记不会
<32-14,House>People lie. Birthmarks don't.

680
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:50,830
<32-15,Thomas>我的天啊
<32-15,Thomas>Oh, my god!

681
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,510
<32-15,Thomas>你说过他是个早产儿的
<32-15,Thomas>You told me he was a premie.

682
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:57,240
<32-15,Thomas>这个疯子竟然是我儿子
<32-15,Thomas>This bloody lunatic is my son!

683
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,700
<32-16,Blythe>他不是疯子
<32-16,Blythe>He's not a lunatic.

684
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,160
<32-17,Thomas>这么多年了  你早该告诉我
<32-17,Thomas>All those years you could have told me.

685
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,380
<32-17,Thomas>我原本可以尽父责
<32-17,Thomas>I could have done things.

686
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,710
<32-17,Thomas>或许就可以改变你儿子的人生
<32-17,Thomas>That could have made a difference in the boy's life.

687
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:05,360
<32-18,Wilson>我觉得大家都该冷静下
<32-18,Wilson>I think we should all just calm down.

688
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,680
<32-19,Thomas>看看他坐着那德行
<32-19,Thomas>Look at him sitting there...

689
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,540
<32-19,Thomas>一个嗑药的反社会
<32-19,Thomas>A pill-popping sociopath!

690
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:10,550
<32-19,Thomas>你把他人生给毁得
<32-19,Thomas>If you wanted to screw up his life,

691
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:12,010
<32-19,Thomas>也太彻底了吧
<32-19,Thomas>you couldn't have done it better.

692
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:13,020
<32-20,House>这点他说得没错  老妈
<32-20,House>He's got you there, mom.

693
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:16,430
<32-21,Blythe>他是世界上最受推崇的医生之一
<32-21,Blythe>He's one of the most well-respected doctors in the world.

694
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:19,020
<32-21,Blythe>他救治的人你数都数不清
<32-21,Blythe>He's saved more lives than you can count.

695
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:23,620
<32-21,Blythe>马上向他道歉  不然我发誓
<32-21,Blythe>Now, you apologize to him, or I swear,

696
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:25,950
<32-21,Blythe>托马斯  你休想再见到我
<32-21,Blythe>wou will never see me again, Thomas.

697
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:28,160
<32-22,Thomas>我受不了了
<32-22,Thomas>I can't deal with this anymore.

698
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,670
<32-22,Thomas>他竟然是我儿子
<32-22,Thomas>He's my son?

699
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:32,230
<32-22,Thomas>我得出去透口气
<32-22,Thomas>I'm having a bloody breath of fresh air,

700
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,480
<32-22,Thomas>就这样
<32-22,Thomas>that's what I'm doing.

701
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:42,600
<32-23,House>谁要吃甜点
<32-23,House>So, who's for dessert?

702
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:50,660
<33-1,Will>谁来帮帮我
<33-1,Will>Somebody help me!

703
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:52,940
<33-1,Will>-快来人  - 威尔
<33-1,Will>- Somebody-- - Will?

704
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:55,120
<33-2,Adams>我们是亚当斯医生和奇斯医生
<33-2,Adams>It's Dr. Adams and Dr. Chase.

705
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,460
<33-3,Will>-我们需要知道...  -眼睛  我的眼睛
<33-3,Will>- We just need to know... - My eyes! My eyes!

706
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:59,500
<33-3,Will>像着了火一样
<33-3,Will>It feels like it's on fire!

707
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:10,670
<33-3,Will>这不是白塞氏病
<33-3,Will>It's not Behcet's.

708
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:12,430
<33-3,Will>白塞氏病不会发生这样的组织坏死
<33-3,Will>It doesn't necrotize tissue like this.

709
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:14,380
<34-1,Chase>我认为是化脓性链球菌
<34-1,Chase>I think it's streptococcus pyogenes.

710
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:17,770
<34-2,Adams>但我们已经给他用过广谱抗生素了
<34-2,Adams>Except we've already treated him with broad spectrum antibiotics.

711
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:20,100
<34-2,Adams>细菌不该扩散  而应该死亡
<34-2,Adams>It shouldn't be spreading. It should be dying.

712
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,940
<34-3,Chase>只能说明这是耐药菌
<34-3,Chase>Just means it's drug-resistant.

713
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:25,310
<34-3,Chase>我们必须在坏疽发生之前摘除剩余的眼组织
<34-3,Chase>We need to remove what's left of his eyes Before the gangrene sets in.

714
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:27,550
<34-4,Adams>形态看似细菌  行为也类似细菌
<34-4,Adams>It's something that looks and acts like a bacteria

715
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:28,840
<34-4,Adams>但却不是细菌
<34-4,Adams>but isn't one.

716
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,840
<34-5,Taub>-可能是病毒感染  -不  不可能
<34-5,Taub>- Could be viral. - No, it couldn't.

717
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,530
<34-5,Taub>坏死组织中没有任何病毒标志
<34-5,Taub>There's no evidence of viral markers in the necrotized tissue.

718
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:38,300
<34-6,House>给我看看你们昨晚拍的
<34-6,House>Let me see that image you took last night

719
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,650
<34-6,House>肺部凝块图像
<34-6,House>of the clot in his lung.

720
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:51,660
<34-6,House>这不是脑部凝块的一部分
<34-6,House>That's not a piece of the clot from his brain.

721
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,490
<34-6,House>这才是感染点
<34-6,House>That's the point of infection.

722
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:58,030
<34-6,House>毛霉菌病
<34-6,House>Mucormycosis.

723
00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:00,060
<34-6,House>他吸入了孢子
<34-6,House>He breathed in the spores,

724
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,990
<34-6,House>病菌在他体内生长扩散
<34-6,House>it's been growing and spreading ever since.

725
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:03,740
<34-7,Chase>真菌感染会这么快吗
<34-7,Chase>A fungal infection spreading this fast?

726
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:04,770
<34-8,House>这孩子有糖尿病
<34-8,House>Kid's a diabetic.

727
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:06,540
<34-8,House>他的免疫系统已经瘫痪了
<34-8,House>He already has a compromised immune system.

728
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:09,780
<34-9,Park>豪斯说的对  眼组织样本上布满了真菌
<34-9,Park>He's right. This sample from his eyes is crawling with it.

729
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:11,200
<34-10,House>用两性霉素B治疗
<34-10,House>Treat with Amphotericin B.

730
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:14,260
<34-11,Adams>在认为是细菌感染的时候
<34-11,Adams>We treated him with gentamicin

731
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:15,710
<34-11,Adams>我们已经用了庆大霉素
<34-11,Adams>when we thought it was bacterial,

732
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:18,070
<34-11,Adams>这意味着治疗剂量的两性霉素B
<34-11,Adams>Which means the dose of Amphotericin B we'll need

733
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:21,040
<34-11,Adams>很可能会导致他耳聋
<34-11,Adams>to cure him will probably leave him deaf.

734
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,750
<34-12,House>抱歉  "治疗剂量"后面说了什么
<34-12,House>Sorry, I stopped listening after you said

735
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:25,840
<34-12,House>我都没听
<34-12,House>"the dose we'll need to cure him."

736
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:38,120
<35-1,Will>又聋又瞎
<35-1,Will>Blind and deaf?

737
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:40,980
<35-1,Will>我宁愿死
<35-1,Will>I'd rather be dead.

738
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:43,840
<35-2,Adams>不治疗你会死的
<35-2,Adams>You will be.

739
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:48,580
<35-3,Will>那样我能"活"下去
<35-3,Will>I can live with that.

740
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:54,560
<35-3,Will>你就是听不懂我的笑话
<35-3,Will>You never did get my humor.

741
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:01,200
<35-4,Adams>有可能你不会完全丧失听觉
<35-4,Adams>There's a chance your hearing won't be completely gone.

742
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:06,510
<35-5,Will>有多大可能
<35-5,Will>How much of a chance?

743
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:10,230
<35-6,Adams>很小
<35-6,Adams>A small one.

744
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:12,080
<35-6,Adams>但还是有可能
<35-6,Adams>But a chance.

745
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:23,470
<35-7,Will>我...我拒绝接受治疗
<35-7,Will>I'm--I'm refusing treatment.

746
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:28,770
<35-7,Will>你不了解  我的生活已经有多艰难
<35-7,Will>You don't know how hard things are already for me.

747
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,600
<35-7,Will>再难我承受不来
<35-7,Will>I can't handle any more.

748
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,610
<35-7,Will>不能够了
<35-7,Will>I can't.

749
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,730
<36-1,Thomas>你好
<36-1,Thomas>Oh, hi.

750
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:49,920
<36-1,Thomas>我是来道歉的
<36-1,Thomas>I'm here to apologize.

751
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:53,160
<36-1,Thomas>得知消息我本该表现得更...
<36-1,Thomas>I could have handled the news with more...

752
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:55,990
<36-1,Thomas>沉着
<36-1,Thomas>aplomb?

753
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:01,330
<36-1,Thomas>我有个儿子  这是非常好的事情
<36-1,Thomas>I have a son. That's great news.

754
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:04,880
<36-2,House>她还教你说什么了
<36-2,House>What else did she tell you to say?

755
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,340
<36-3,Thomas>你不是疯子  也不是个错误
<36-3,Thomas>You're not a lunatic, you're not a mistake.

756
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:15,750
<36-4,House>我一直都不喜欢你那位朋友  我父亲
<36-4,House>I never liked your friend... my father.

757
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:19,120
<36-5,Thomas>他这人有时候的确过于激烈
<36-5,Thomas>Well, he could be a bit intense at times.

758
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:22,300
<36-6,House>可是与你不同  我尊重他
<36-6,House>But unlike you, I did respect him.

759
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:27,120
<36-7,Thomas>你尊重你母亲吗
<36-7,Thomas>Do you respect your mother?

760
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:32,950
<36-7,Thomas>我和你一样尊重她
<36-7,Thomas>Well, we do have that in common.

761
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:34,800
<36-7,Thomas>而且我们都爱她
<36-7,Thomas>And we all love her.

762
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,770
<36-7,Thomas>所以我们都没得选择  不是吗
<36-7,Thomas>So we don't have much choice, do we?

763
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:45,080
<36-7,Thomas>儿子  晚餐时见
<36-7,Thomas>Son, see you at dinner.

764
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:03,790
<37-1,Melissa>威尔  是我
<37-1,Melissa>Will, it's me.

765
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:08,540
<37-2,Will>让我猜猜
<37-2,Will>Let me guess.

766
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,970
<37-2,Will>认为我是王八蛋的医生
<37-2,Will>The doctor who thinks I'm an ass

767
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:13,150
<37-2,Will>让你来劝我活下去
<37-2,Will>wants you to convince me to live.

768
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,540
<37-3,Melissa>是的
<37-3,Melissa>Yes.

769
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:24,770
<37-4,Will>-没用的  -我知道
<37-4,Will>- It won't work. - I know.

770
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:28,250
<37-5,Melissa>所以我不会劝你
<37-5,Melissa>So I won't.

771
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:34,180
<37-6,Will>你有这么气我
<37-6,Will>Wow. You're that angry?

772
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:37,110
<37-7,Melissa>我替你做的决定已经够多了
<37-7,Melissa>I've made enough decisions for you.

773
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:41,180
<37-7,Melissa>这是你的生活
<37-7,Melissa>This is your life.

774
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:45,850
<37-8,Will>你为什么回来
<37-8,Will>Why'd you come back?

775
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:50,980
<37-9,Melissa>因为我爱你
<37-9,Melissa>Because I love you.

776
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:57,140
<37-9,Melissa>我想要陪你走过最后一段
<37-9,Melissa>And I want to be with you for as long as I can.

777
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:03,300
<37-10,Will>梅丽莎  我好害怕
<37-10,Will>Melissa, I'm so scared.

778
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:06,900
<37-11,Melissa>我也怕
<37-11,Melissa>Me too.

779
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:14,580
<37-11,Melissa>我会永远爱你
<37-11,Melissa>I'll always love you.

780
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,820
<37-12,Will>即便我聋了吗
<37-12,Will>Even if I was deaf?

781
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,290
<37-13,Melissa>即便发生任何事情
<37-13,Melissa>Even if anything.

782
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:44,330
<38-1,Melissa>起效了吗
<38-1,Melissa>Is it working?

783
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:46,530
<38-2,Adams>他的病情仍然非常严重
<38-2,Adams>He's still very ill,

784
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:49,640
<38-2,Adams>不过如果按目前的治疗效果发展
<38-2,Adams>but if he keeps responding the way he has been,

785
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:51,190
<38-2,Adams>他应该会好起来的
<38-2,Adams>he should be fine.

786
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:56,430
<38-3,Melissa>-他的听觉呢  -完全丧失
<38-3,Melissa>- And his hearing? - It's gone.

787
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:58,690
<38-4,Adams>现在还无法确定是不是永久性的
<38-4,Adams>We don't know yet if it'll be permanent.

788
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:10,570
<38-5,Melissa>梅丽莎  是你吗
<38-5,Melissa>Melissa? Is that you?

789
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:12,080
<38-6,Adams>我们捏他的手来表示
<38-6,Adams>We've been squeezing his hand,

790
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,920
<38-6,Adams>一下表示是  两下表示不是
<38-6,Adams>once for yes, twice for no.

791
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:21,840
<38-7,Will>可以问你一件事吗
<38-7,Will>Can I ask you something?

792
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:26,030
<38-7,Will>如果你捏不  我完全能理解
<38-7,Will>I completely understand if you squeeze no.

793
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:35,130
<38-7,Will>你愿意嫁给我吗
<38-7,Will>Will you marry me?

794
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:47,040
<38-7,Will>不要这个时候不回答我
<38-7,Will>Don't leave me hanging, now.

795
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,080
<38-8,Melissa>我愿意
<38-8,Melissa>Yes.

796
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:51,240
<38-8,Melissa>我愿意  当然愿意
<38-8,Melissa>Yes! Of course, yes!

797
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:55,010
<38-9,Will>我听到了  你说愿意  是吗
<38-9,Will>I--I heard that. You said yes, right?

798
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:56,510
<38-9,Will>-我愿意  -你说愿意了
<38-9,Will>- Yes! - You said yes.

799
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:09,600
<39-1,House>你打算等多久才告诉我
<39-1,House>How long are you gonna wait until you tell me?

800
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:12,910
<39-2,Wilson>圣诞老人不存在我早告诉你了
<39-2,Wilson>I thought we already had the Santa Claus talk.

801
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:16,140
<39-3,House>你在餐厅偷拿了托马斯的叉子
<39-3,House>You don't think I saw you steal Thomas' fork

802
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:17,190
<39-3,House>你以为我没看见
<39-3,House>from the restaurant?

803
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:18,240
<39-4,Wilson>我偷他的叉子做什么
<39-4,Wilson>Why would I do that?

804
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,740
<39-5,House>验他的DNA
<39-5,House>For his DNA.

805
00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:23,450
<39-6,Wilson>那个...  你还...
<39-6,Wilson>That's... that's...

806
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,500
<39-6,Wilson>真有观察力
<39-6,Wilson>very observant of you.

807
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,900
<39-7,House>看吧  你比你装作的要更像我
<39-7,House>See, you're more me than you pretend.

808
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,640
<39-7,House>事实真相你非要确认不可
<39-7,House>You had to know for sure.

809
00:42:31,970 --> 00:42:33,430
<39-7,House>所以你需要证据
<39-7,House>So you needed proof.

810
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:37,540
<39-7,House>而你没有告诉我结果
<39-7,House>The fact that you haven't told me

811
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:38,670
<39-7,House>只可能是因为...
<39-7,House>can only mean...

812
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:43,010
<39-8,Wilson>他也不是你父亲
<39-8,Wilson>He isn't your father either.

813
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:52,830
<39-8,Wilson>我很抱歉
<39-8,Wilson>I'm sorry.

814
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:57,950
<39-9,House>你知道这意味着什么
<39-9,House>You know what that means.

815
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,500
<39-10,Wilson>你妈是个荡妇
<39-10,Wilson>Your mom's a slut.

816
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:00,930
<39-10,Wilson>没错
<39-10,Wilson>That...

817
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:07,730
<39-11,House>还有就是  她不像我一直以为的那样无趣
<39-11,House>And... She's not as boring as I thought she was.
