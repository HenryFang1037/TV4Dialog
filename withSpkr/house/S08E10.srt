<1-4,Jane Doe>Yeah, no, it's not like it's serious.

5
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:18,910
<1-4,Jane Doe>我在网上查了  就是...
<1-4,Jane Doe>I-I checked online, and it's...

6
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:20,070
<1-4,Jane Doe>哮喘或是别的什么小病
<1-4,Jane Doe>asthma or something.

7
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,200
<1-4,Jane Doe>"别的什么小病"
<1-4,Jane Doe>"Or something"

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,830
<1-5,House>可是没有医学文凭的

9
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,230
<1-5,House>青少年的头号杀手

<1-5,House>他上次带你看医生是什么时候
<1-5,House>When was the last time he took you to see a doctor?

11

<1-6,Jane Doe>大约五个月前
<1-6,Jane Doe>Uh, like five months ago.

<1-6,Jane Doe>我们去了一家在特伦顿的诊所
<1-6,Jane Doe>We went a clinic in Trenton.

00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,380
<1-6,Jane Doe>我得了链球菌咽喉炎
<1-6,Jane Doe>I had strep throat.

15
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:32,170
<1-7,House>你还记得他们给你用的什么抗生素吗
<1-7,House>You remember the antibiotic they gave you?

16
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:33,240
<1-7,House>是不是新霉素
<1-7,House>Is it neomycin?

17
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,560
<1-8,Jane Doe>是阿莫西林
<1-8,Jane Doe>Amoxicillin.

18
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:41,250
<1-8,Jane Doe>那哮喘吸入器  我...
<1-8,Jane Doe>So about the inhaler for my asthma, I was--

19
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,280
<1-8,Jane Doe>抱歉
<1-8,Jane Doe>Sorry!

20
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,780
<1-9,House>医院明文规定
<1-9,House>Hospital policy

21
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,990
<1-9,House>禁止我向没有亲属关系
<1-9,House>specifically prohibits me from giving meds

22
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:47,330
<1-9,House>却装成父女的无业游民
<1-9,House>to unrelated homeless people

23
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:48,870
<1-9,House>提供任何药物
<1-9,House>pretending to be father and daughter.

24
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:51,790
<1-9,House>你的裤子小了一号
<1-9,House>Your pants are a size too short,

25
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:53,570
<1-9,House>你要不就是突然长高了几寸
<1-9,House>so either you grew a couple of inches

26
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:55,150
<1-9,House>要不就是在旧货店随便拿了凑合穿的
<1-9,House>or you grabbed the closest size in a thrift store.

27
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:57,730
<1-9,House>而你有酒窝  虽然挺可爱
<1-9,House>And only you have dimples, which are adorable,

28
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:00,650
<1-9,House>但它是X染色体显性遗传
<1-9,House>but they're also an X-linked dominant genetic trait,

29
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,400
<1-9,House>这倒是说明不了什么问题
<1-9,House>which actually doesn't prove anything.

30
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,310
<1-9,House>她没有哭正好说明
<1-9,House>The fact that she didn't burst into tears tells me

31
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:06,970
<1-9,House>你从没认为他是你爸爸
<1-9,House>that you never thought he was your dad.

32
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,710
<1-10,Jane Doe>咱们快走吧
<1-10,Jane Doe>Let's get out of here.

33
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,860
<1-11,House>你既然你是主谋
<1-11,House>Since you're the brains of the operation,

34
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:13,770
<1-11,House>你最好留下来
<1-11,House>might wanna stick around.

35
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,800
<1-12,Jane Doe>难道要我在这等着被社工带走吗
<1-12,Jane Doe>What, so I can get busted by Social Services?

36
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,690
<1-13,House>不  那样的话你耳朵就不会再继续出血了
<1-13,House>No, so you can stop bleeding out of your ear.

37
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:23,180
<1-13,House>这一般是头骨骨折的表现
<1-13,House>It's usually a sign of a skull fracture.

38
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,850
<1-13,House>有人拿你的头当球踢吗
<1-13,House>Someone been using your head as a soccer ball?

39
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:27,710
<1-14,Jane Doe>没有
<1-14,Jane Doe>No.

40
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:29,610
<1-15,House>虽然我很想相信你的话
<1-15,House>Much as I'd like to take your word for it,

41
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:31,850
<1-15,House>但我没兴趣去相信
<1-15,House>I have no interest in taking your word for it.

42
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,610
<1-15,House>没有压痛感  也没有疼痛感
<1-15,House>No tenderness, no pain.

43
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,340
<1-15,House>看来你倒是说了
<1-15,House>Looks like you might actually be telling

44
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:38,590
<1-15,House>一部分实话
<1-15,House>the truth about something.

45
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:44,980
<1-15,House>耳道没有问题
<1-15,House>Ear canal is fine.

46
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:48,160
<1-15,House>也没发烧
<1-15,House>You don't have a fever.

47
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:50,650
<1-15,House>给这男的结账
<1-15,House>Pay the man.

48
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:52,570
<1-15,House>垃圾桶篝火晚会他要迟到了
<1-15,House>He's late for a trashcan fire.

49
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,130
<1-16,Jane Doe>你能...能不能告诉我这是怎么回事
<1-16,Jane Doe>Would you--would you tell me what's going on?

50
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:07,350
<1-16,Jane Doe>我到底有什么病
<1-16,Jane Doe>What's wrong with me?

51
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,400
<1-17,House>我也不知道
<1-17,House>I have no idea.

69
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,310
<1-17,House>总监：
<1-17,House>zlean

71

72
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,350
<2-1,Taub>离医院三十英里的地方见面啊
<2-1,Taub>30 miles away from the hospital?

73
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,210
<2-2,House>因为我能胡跑了
<2-2,House>Because I can.

74
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:58,020
<2-2,House>还有  克里斯·克里斯蒂在博客里说
<2-2,House>Also, Chris Christie's blog

76
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:00,700
<2-2,House>这里的煎饼是最棒的
<2-2,House>says the pancakes here are the best.

77
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,440
<2-2,House>现在我们有一个十八岁的病人
<2-2,House>So...what do we got on this 18-year-old

78
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,140
<2-2,House>耳朵出血  呼吸困难
<2-2,House>with the ear bleed and the breathing problems.

79
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,120
<2-3,Adams>CT确认过了没有颅骨骨折
<2-3,Adams>CT confirms no skull fracture,

80
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,320
<2-3,Adams>还有  她未满十八岁
<2-3,Adams>and looking at her confirms she's not 18.

81
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,610
<2-4,House>不  她到了
<2-4,House>Yes, she is.

82
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,820
<2-4,House>病历里这么说的
<2-4,House>Says so in the file.

83
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,210
<2-5,Adams>我们不能给一个无监护人的未成年人看病
<2-5,Adams>We can't treat an underage patient without a guardian--

84
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:16,130
<2-5,Adams>我们得通知社会服务部
<2-5,Adams>We need to call Social Services.

85
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:17,690
<2-6,House>我和病人说定了
<2-6,House>I cut a deal with the patient.

86
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:19,540
<2-6,House>我们不通知  她也不跑
<2-6,House>We don't call, she doesn't bolt.

87
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,020
<2-7,Taub>不管她多大  无家可归
<2-7,Taub>Whatever age, living on the street

88
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,610
<2-7,Taub>很容易导致营养不良
<2-7,Taub>makes her vulnerable to malnutrition,

89
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:23,900
<2-7,Taub>吸毒  患艾滋病
<2-7,Taub>drug use, H.I.V.,

90
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,340
<2-7,Taub>这些都能解释她的症状
<2-7,Taub>all things which could explain her symptoms.

91
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,900
<2-8,Chase>无营养不良的迹象  毒理检验没有发现
<2-8,Chase>No sign of malnutrition. Tox screen is clear.

<2-9,House>天啊  确实是
<2-9,House>Oh, my goodness, it is!

95
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:38,520
<2-9,House>你好啊  福曼院长
<2-9,House>Hi, Dean Foreman!

96
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,170
<2-9,House>是因为咱俩结婚了
<2-9,House>Are you not gonna introduce us

97
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:53,490
<2-9,House>所以不打算介绍我们认识吗
<2-9,House>because we're married?

98
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,670
<2-9,House>不  等等  是她结婚了
<2-9,House>Oh, no, wait. That's her.

99
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:58,620
<2-10,Foreman>她是一名医药代表  这只是一顿工作早餐
<2-10,Foreman>She's a pharmaceutical rep, and this is a working breakfast.

100
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,410
<2-11,House>在一个离你家和医院
<2-11,House>In a restaurant that's nowhere near your home

101
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:01,430
<2-11,House>都很远的餐厅吗
<2-11,House>or the hospital.

102
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:03,900
<2-12,Foreman>克里斯·克里斯蒂说这里的煎饼好吃
<2-12,Foreman>Chris Christie recommends the pancakes.

103
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,600
<2-13,Chase>中耳鳞状细胞癌可能
<2-13,Chase>Squamous cell middle ear tumor could have

104
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,620
<2-13,Chase>引起耳朵出血
<2-13,Chase>caused the ear bleed.

105
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,600
<2-13,Chase>副肿瘤综合症引起的反应造成呼吸困难
<2-13,Chase>Paraneoplastic reaction caused the breathing problems.

106
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,160
<2-14,Taub>中耳看起来一切正常
<2-14,Taub>Middle ear looks completely normal.

107
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,400
<2-14,Taub>但是第三脑室内壁
<2-14,Taub>But there is thickening in the lining

108
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,650
<2-14,Taub>出现了增厚
<2-14,Taub>of the wall of the third ventricle.

109
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:18,400
<2-14,Taub>可能是颅内感染
<2-14,Taub>Could be a sign of cerebral infection.

110
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,810
<2-15,Adams>但不能解释没有发热
<2-15,Adams>Wouldn't explain the lack of fever.

111
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,120
<2-15,Adams>肺炎双球菌在无家可归者里
<2-15,Adams>Pneumococcus is pretty common

112
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,570
<2-15,Adams>十分普遍
<2-15,Adams>among the homeless population.

113
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:24,120
<2-15,Adams>我们应该去查查她有没有打过疫苗
<2-15,Adams>We should find out if she's been vaccinated.

114
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,090
<2-16,House>行  去问她吧  当她拒绝
<2-16,House>Sure, ask her, and when she refuses

115
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:27,100
<2-16,House>告诉你任何事时
<2-16,House>to tell you anything,

116
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,670
<2-18,House>就给她用头孢曲松治肺炎双球菌
<2-18,House>start her on Ceftriaxone for pneumococcus.

117
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:33,190
<2-17,Taub>如果她说她打过疫苗呢
<2-17,Taub>And if she says she has been vaccinated?

118
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,250
<2-18,House>那就不要去相信她
<2-18,House>Then don't believe her,

119
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,090
<2-18,House>用头孢曲松钠来治肺炎双球菌
<2-18,House>and start her on Ceftriaxone for pneumococcus.

120
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:38,030
<2-19,Adams>不如我们不相信她会逃跑
<2-19,Adams>How about we don't believe she's gonna bolt

121
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:39,510
<2-19,Adams>然后通知社会服务部怎么样
<2-19,Adams>and we call Social Services?

122
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,680
<2-20,House>我在厕所里时
<2-20,House>While I'm in the little boys' room,

123
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,280
<2-20,House>你可以假装我在考虑你的建议
<2-20,House>you can pretend that I'm seriously considering that idea.

124
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:46,630
<2-21,Park>厕所在那边啊
<2-21,Park>The bathroom's that way.

125
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:49,150
<2-22,House>我肯定医院里也有
<2-22,House>Pretty sure there's one in the hospital.

126
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,870
<3-1,Adams>当我跟你一样大时  我离家出走
<3-1,Adams>When I was your age, I ran away,

127
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,580
<3-1,Adams>一个人生活
<3-1,Adams>lived on my own.

128
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,430
<3-1,Adams>-那时好像...  -我猜猜啊
<3-1,Adams>- At the time, it seemed-- - Oh, let me guess.

129
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:05,970
<3-2,Jane Doe>和爸妈在一起生活  太拘束
<3-2,Jane Doe>Life with mom and dad was kind of a drag.

130
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:07,790
<3-2,Jane Doe>所以你就离家出走
<3-2,Jane Doe>So you just ran away,

131
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:10,540
<3-2,Jane Doe>和朋友住在一起  整日狂欢
<3-2,Jane Doe>lived with friends, and partied with guys

132
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,510
<3-2,Jane Doe>你知道父母很讨厌你这样
<3-2,Jane Doe>that you knew your parents would hate.

133
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:14,430
<3-2,Jane Doe>之后等你叛逆够了
<3-2,Jane Doe>And then when you got tired of being a rebel,

134
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,450
<3-2,Jane Doe>就回家去
<3-2,Jane Doe>you just went home.

135
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,050
<3-2,Jane Doe>无家可归对我来说可不是在度假
<3-2,Jane Doe>Being homeless isn't a vacation for me.

136
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,640
<3-2,Jane Doe>我不是要特立独行
<3-2,Jane Doe>And I'm not acting out.

137
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,990
<3-2,Jane Doe>我在家里的生活烂透了
<3-2,Jane Doe>My life at home sucked,

138
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:26,420
<3-2,Jane Doe>所以我逃了出来
<3-2,Jane Doe>so I got the hell out of there.

139
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,640
<3-3,Taub>除了住在街上
<3-3,Taub>There are other options

140
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,390
<3-3,Taub>还有别的选择啊
<3-3,Taub>besides living on the streets.

141
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:32,100
<3-4,Jane Doe>对  比如儿童之家
<3-4,Jane Doe>Right, like group homes, where you're packed in

142
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:35,040
<3-4,Jane Doe>全是行为不端的失足儿童
<3-4,Jane Doe>with as many messed-up delinquent kids as possible,

143
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,520
<3-4,Jane Doe>寄养父母会收留你
<3-4,Jane Doe>foster parents who only take you in

144
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,540
<3-4,Jane Doe>不过是因为你就张饭票
<3-4,Jane Doe>because you're a meal ticket.

145
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:40,340
<3-5,Taub>寄养家庭收留一个孩子后
<3-5,Taub>每周会获得175美元的补助

146
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:40,340
<3-5,Taub>我能想到更简单的方法一周赚175块钱
<3-5,Taub>I can think of easier ways to make 175 bucks a week.

147
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,910
<3-6,Jane Doe>你说得对  我真应该赌一把
<3-6,Jane Doe>No, you're right-- I really should roll the dice

148
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:43,920
<3-6,Jane Doe>然后祈祷这对夫妇不要像我妈一样
<3-6,Jane Doe>and hope for a pair that don't ruin my life

149
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,880
<3-6,Jane Doe>毁了我的生活...  别动我的东西
<3-6,Jane Doe>the way that my mom-- Get your hands off my stuff!

150
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,870
<3-7,Adams>你的东西或许能提供更多有关你生病的信息
<3-7,Adams>The stuff might tell us more about why you're sick.

151
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,460
<3-7,Adams>历史课本  你还去上学吗
<3-7,Adams>A history textbook. You go to school?

152
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,540
<3-8,Jane Doe>我没想一直无家可归啊
<3-8,Jane Doe>I don't plan on being homeless forever.

153
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,410
<4-1,George>你好  先生
<4-1,George>Hello, good sir.

154
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,530
<4-1,George>我的兄弟  这位将军
<4-1,George>My brother, the General here,

155
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:03,380
<4-1,George>吃坏了肚子
<4-1,George>gots the green-apple quickstep.

156
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:11,640
<4-2,House>显然咱们中间有人穿越了
<4-2,House>One of us is in the wrong time zone.

157
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,850
<4-2,House>如果是我  我得去找股票经纪人
<4-2,House>And if it's me, I need to talk to a stockbroker

158
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:16,800
<4-2,House>然后和肯尼迪家族的人聊一聊
<4-2,House>and anyone from the Kennedy family,

159
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,450
<4-2,House>就按这顺序来
<4-2,House>in that order.

160
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:18,700
<4-3,George>他拉肚子了
<4-3,George>Well, he got the runs,

161
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,700
<4-3,George>而我们确实需要他好起来
<4-3,George>and we do need him up

162
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,140
<4-3,George>明天才能上战场
<4-3,George>and at 'em for battle tomorrow.

163
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,430
<4-4,House>来这么现代的诊所
<4-4,House>It's hardly authentic,

164
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,380
<4-4,House>你们也太假了吧
<4-4,House>coming to a newfangled clinic,

165
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,170
<4-4,House>尤其我还是个北方佬医生
<4-4,House>especially with a Yankee doctor.

166
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,010
<4-5,Sheldon>先生  你是在质疑我的决心吗
<4-5,Sheldon>Sir, are you questioning my resolve?

167
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,390
<4-6,House>对  还有你的精神状况
<4-6,House>Yes, and your sanity.

168
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:34,910
<4-6,House>我一并都给你检查了
<4-6,House>I'm multitasking.

169
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,420
<4-6,House>将军
<4-6,House>General...

170
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,260
<4-7,George>你不能出去
<4-7,George>You're not allowed out.

171
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,970
<4-7,George>我们发誓要一起见识那大象的
<4-7,George>We swore that we would see the elephant together.

172
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,940
<4-8,House>我可不要夹在两个疯子
<4-8,House>Well, far be it from me to come between two nut jobs

173
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,200
<4-8,House>和他们的"大象"之间
<4-8,House>and their "Elephant."

174
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,150
<4-8,House>如果你们想再逼真点的话
<4-8,House>I could add some mercury,

175
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,620
<4-8,House>我可以给你们打点鸡血
<4-8,House>if you want to make it more authentic.

176
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:02,160
<4-9,George>南部邦联向你表示感谢  医生
<4-9,George>The Confederacy thanks you, Doc.

177
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,180
<5-1,Chase>我拿到豪斯的手机
<5-1,Chase>Got House's phone,

178
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,760
<5-1,Chase>删掉了所有你和安妮塔的照片
<5-1,Chase>deleted all photos of you and Anita.

179
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:20,610
<5-2,Foreman>-我欠你个人情  -搞外遇啊
<5-2,Foreman>- I owe you. - An affair?

180
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,460
<5-3,Taub>还真不知道你这么淫荡啊
<5-3,Taub>Never knew you were such a tramp.

181
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,440
<5-4,Foreman>我也没有想到
<5-4,Foreman>Neither did I.

182
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,680
<5-4,Foreman>安妮塔风趣又聪明
<5-4,Foreman>Anita, she's fun, smart.

183
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,780
<5-4,Foreman>又不想要真正的恋情
<5-4,Foreman>Not looking for anything serious.

184
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,940
<5-4,Foreman>这样....  相当不错
<5-4,Foreman>It's--it's... Pretty perfect.

185
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:33,690
<5-4,Foreman>除了觉得对不起她丈夫
<5-4,Foreman>Except for the annoying guilt about the husband,

186
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:35,440
<5-4,Foreman>她要向他撒好多谎
<5-4,Foreman>the lies she must be telling him.

187
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,910
<5-5,Chase>愧疚归愧疚  还不至于终止你们的关系
<5-5,Chase>But not guilty enough to stop seeing her.

188
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:39,250
<5-6,Taub>她那么性感
<5-6,Taub>She's smoking hot,

189
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,670
<5-6,Taub>维护她的婚姻又不是他的责任
<5-6,Taub>and it's not his job to protect her marriage.

190
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,870
<5-7,Foreman>此时你不是应该指手画脚
<5-7,Foreman>Aren't you supposed to be pointing a finger

191
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,290
<5-7,Foreman>让我以你为前车之鉴吗
<5-7,Foreman>at your own life as a cautionary tale?

192
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:48,170
<5-8,Taub>如果不是偷情  我可能不会离婚
<5-8,Taub>If not for cheating, I might still have a wife,

193
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:50,540
<5-8,Taub>但也不会有苏菲和苏菲娅
<5-8,Taub>but I wouldn't have Sophie and Sophia.

194
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:52,730
<5-8,Taub>也就是说
<5-8,Taub>Which means I

195
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:55,030
<5-8,Taub>我也不用为了她们这周的留宿
<5-8,Taub>wouldn't be preparing for their visit this week

196
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:57,690
<5-8,Taub>给所有的橱柜上婴儿防护锁
<5-8,Taub>by child locking all my cabinets,

197
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:59,160
<5-8,Taub>包好桌角
<5-8,Taub>padding table corners,

198
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,280
<5-8,Taub>把所有的杂志都藏起来
<5-8,Taub>and getting rid of every single magazine.

199
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:04,690
<5-9,Chase>可能在你的内衣抽屉里
<5-9,Chase>You could probably just hide the porn

200
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:05,980
<5-9,Chase>还藏着色情录像
<5-9,Chase>in your underwear drawer.

201
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:09,350
<5-10,Taub>没有杂志我才不会忽略我的孩子
<5-10,Taub>Magazines go away so I won't ignore my children.

202
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,450
<5-10,Taub>我知道我必须关注她们
<5-10,Taub>I know I have to pay attention to them.

203
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,210
<5-10,Taub>我也想要关心她们
<5-10,Taub>I want to pay attention to them,

204
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:16,160
<5-10,Taub>但她们就是
<5-10,Taub>but they're just so...

205
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,290
<5-10,Taub>无聊至极
<5-10,Taub>boring.

206
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,980
<5-11,Taub>在无名氏的学校有什么发现吗
<5-11,Taub>Did you learn anything at Jane Doe's school?

207
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:29,900
<5-12,Adams>他们注射了很多疫苗
<5-12,Adams>They did a bunch of vaccinations,

208
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:30,930
<5-12,Adams>包括肺炎球菌
<5-12,Adams>including pneumococcus.

209
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,910
<5-12,Adams>给她停用头孢曲松
<5-12,Adams>Take her off the Ceftriaxone.

210
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,220
<5-13,Taub>我们又回到零点了啊
<5-13,Taub>So we're back to square none?

211
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,600
<6-1,Adams>不能这么说
<6-1,Adams>Not exactly.

212
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,730
<6-1,Adams>她登记的名字应该是捏造的
<6-1,Adams>The name she registered under seems to be fake,

213
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:39,650
<6-1,Adams>但地址是座被取消赎回权的房子
<6-1,Adams>but the address is a foreclosed house.

214
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:41,150
<6-1,Adams>有其它发现再通知你们
<6-1,Adams>We'll let you know what we find.

215
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:45,710
<6-2,Park>很多食物和水
<6-2,Park>Plenty of food, water.

216
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:46,730
<6-3,Adams>还有啤酒
<6-3,Adams>And beer.

217
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:48,130
<6-4,Park>她饮食很好
<6-4,Park>She eats well.

218
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:49,990
<6-4,Park>在校上学  成绩不错
<6-4,Park>Goes to school and makes good grades.

219
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:50,970
<6-4,Park>她是个无家可归的姑娘
<6-4,Park>She's a homeless girl

220
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,400
<6-4,Park>又是排球队队长
<6-4,Park>who's captain of the volleyball team.

221
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,110
<6-5,Adams>你能忍受这些吗
<6-5,Adams>How can you be okay with this?

222
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:56,530
<6-5,Adams>如果你妈尽让你和零食作伴
<6-5,Adams>Your mom sends you to work with snacks.

223
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:58,550
<6-6,Park>我渴望也需要家长
<6-6,Park>I want and need parents.

224
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:00,580
<6-6,Park>这女孩无父无母  日子却很滋润
<6-6,Park>Jane Doe is flourishing without them.

225
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:01,410
<6-6,Park>可能吧
<6-6,Park>Maybe.

226
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,130
<6-7,Adams>但这些真菌绝对很滋润
<6-7,Adams>But this mold definitely is.

227
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,090
<7-1,Jane Doe>你们去了我学校
<7-1,Jane Doe>You went to my school.

228
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:10,860
<7-1,Jane Doe>现在他们知道了  他们会举报我的
<7-1,Jane Doe>Now that they know, they'll report me.

229
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,440
<7-1,Jane Doe>我回不去了
<7-1,Jane Doe>I can't go back there!

230
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:14,830
<7-2,Adams>你可能有真菌感染
<7-2,Adams>You may have a fungal infection.

231
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,050
<7-2,Adams>你需要服药
<7-2,Adams>You need that medicine.

232
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:17,270
<7-3,Jane Doe>氟康唑  是吧
<7-3,Jane Doe>Fluconazole, right?

233
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:18,700
<7-3,Jane Doe>我会去诊所拿药的
<7-3,Jane Doe>I'll get it at a clinic.

234
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:23,820
<7-3,Jane Doe>我的腿没有知觉了
<7-3,Jane Doe>I can't feel my legs.

235
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:26,040
<7-3,Jane Doe>那个  是感染导致的吗
<7-3,Jane Doe>Hey, wha-- is that the infection?

236
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,210
<7-4,Adams>我看不是
<7-4,Adams>I don't think so.

237
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:33,640
<7-4,Adams>那么  是什么导致外耳道出血
<7-4,Adams>So...what causes an ear bleed,

238
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,070
<8-1,House>呼吸困难
<8-1,House>breathing problems,

239
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:37,980
<8-1,House>我们的逃家者无力逃跑
<8-1,House>and our runaway's inability to run away?

240
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,900
<8-2,Chase>真菌感染已经被排除了
<8-2,Chase>Fungal infection's off the table.

241
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,370
<8-2,Chase>会不会是横贯性脊髓炎
<8-2,Chase>What about transverse myelitis?

242
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:44,610
<8-3,House>但是脊髓后索功能正常
<8-3,House>Not with normal posterior column function.

243
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:46,890
<8-3,House>几个月来我一直等着这一刻
<8-3,House>I've been waiting to do this for months.

244
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:47,990
<8-3,House>发射
<8-3,House>Pull!

245
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:55,270
<8-3,House>这一击准星没瞄好
<8-3,House>Sights seem to be off on this.

246
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:58,380
<8-4,Adams>我们之前没打电话给社会服务部门
<8-4,Adams>We didn't call Social Services before

247
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,360
<8-4,Adams>是因为我们不想病人逃跑
<8-4,Adams>because we didn't want the patient to take off.

248
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,830
<8-4,Adams>现在她逃不了了  我们没理由不打电话
<8-4,Adams>Now she can't--there's no reason for us not to call.

249
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:05,250
<8-5,House>好吧  没有理由打电话这理由行吗
<8-5,House>Well, how about the reason that there's no reason?

250
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:07,260
<8-5,House>我觉得我可以接受
<8-5,House>This is working fine for me.

251
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,590
<8-5,House>发射
<8-5,House>Pull!

252
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:14,420
<8-5,House>刚刚那个显然是采取了逃避策略
<8-5,House>Well, now, that one clearly took evasive action.

253
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,760
<8-6,Adams>你想保护她是因为你觉得没有社工帮助
<8-6,Adams>You want to protect her because you think she's fine on her own,

254
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,850
<8-6,Adams>她也过得很好
<8-6,Adams>outside the system.

255
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,760
<8-7,House>有人对病人的病情有看法吗
<8-7,House>Does anyone have a position on our patient's medical condition?

256
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,380
<8-8,Taub>可能是心内膜炎并发脓毒性菌栓症
<8-8,Taub>Could be endocarditis with septic emboli.

257
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,210
<8-8,Taub>发射
<8-8,Taub>Pull!

258
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:30,520
<8-9,House>我真想转身爆了你  可惜会害我失手
<8-9,House>I'd turn around and shoot you, but apparently I'd miss.

259
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,650
<8-9,House>没有心区杂音  也没有体表奥斯勒节结
<8-9,House>There's no murmurs, no Osler nodes.

260
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:34,580
<8-10,Park>你以前从没玩过  是吧
<8-10,Park>You've never done this before, have you?

261
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,760
<8-11,House>是啊  没有耶
<8-11,House>No, I have not.

262
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,310
<8-11,House>但我带着追踪器时  就跃跃欲试
<8-11,House>But all the time I had my ankle monitor on,

263
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:40,210
<8-11,House>无法自由行动让我极其郁闷
<8-11,House>I was furious that I couldn't.

264
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,720
<8-12,Chase>血管炎符合病症
<8-12,Chase>Vasculitis fits.

265
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,460
<8-13,House>开始给她用类固醇治疗
<8-13,House>Start treatment with steroids.

266
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:49,080
<8-13,House>她很幸运  马上又可以开始流亡了
<8-13,House>She's lucky, she'll be free to flee again.

267
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,050
<8-14,Adams>除非我打电话给社会服务部门
<8-14,Adams>Not once I call Social Services.

268
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:53,060
<8-14,Adams>我不会放弃的
<8-14,Adams>I'm not giving up.

269
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,530
<8-15,House>想打赌吗
<8-15,House>You wanna bet?

270
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:58,330
<8-15,House>一枪  定胜负
<8-15,House>One shot, one birdie.

271
00:10:58,330 --> 00:10:59,640
<8-15,House>你打中了  就打电话
<8-15,House>You hit, you make the call.

272
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,600
<8-15,House>失手的话  就不要再提此事
<8-15,House>You miss, never mention it again.

273
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,310
<8-15,House>不干
<8-15,House>No.

274
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:03,780
<8-16,Adams>我为何要同意
<8-16,Adams>Why would I agree?

275
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,040
<8-17,House>因为你另外的选择就是
<8-17,House>'Cause your only other option is

276
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,080
<8-17,House>你打电话  我炒你鱿鱼
<8-17,House>you call and I fire you.

277
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:26,550
<8-18,Adams>发射
<8-18,Adams>Pull!

278
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:43,570
<9-1,Taub>皮质类固醇有用吗
<9-1,Taub>She responding to corticosteroids?

279
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:44,420
<9-2,Adams>好像是的
<9-2,Adams>Looks like it.

280
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,130
<9-2,Adams>还有社会服务部门
<9-2,Adams>And Social Services.

281
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:49,390
<9-3,Taub>我一直以为她会抵死反抗
<9-3,Taub>I thought for sure there'd be some yelling

282
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:51,320
<9-3,Taub>大吵大闹  甚至发生流血事件
<9-3,Taub>or profanity, possible bloodletting.

283
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,420
<9-4,Adams>她最终也厌倦了无家可归的生活
<9-4,Adams>She's tired of living on the streets after all.

284
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,170
<9-4,Adams>我想豪斯会后悔...
<9-4,Adams>I'll bet House re...gret...

285
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:02,250
<9-4,Adams>他会不会早就知道我是神枪手啊
<9-4,Adams>Could he know I'm good with a gun?

286
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:05,550
<9-5,Taub>我不知道为什么  但是
<9-5,Taub>I don't know how, but...

287
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:09,290
<9-5,Taub>雇佣妓女
<9-5,Taub>Hiring a hooker

288
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:10,520
<10-1,Foreman>假扮社工
<10-1,Foreman>to pretend to be a social worker?

289
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,080
<10-2,House>她和我打了个她胜券在握的赌
<10-2,House>She took a bet that she knew she'd win.

290
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,170
<10-2,House>说实话  我很受伤
<10-2,House>Frankly, I feel violated.

291
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:17,290
<10-3,Adams>我联系的那位社工怎么了
<10-3,Adams>What happened to the social worker I called?

292
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:19,180
<10-4,Foreman>显然  有自称是"愤侯"医生的人
<10-4,Foreman>Apparently, someone identifying themselves

293
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:22,010
<10-4,Foreman>打电话过去说病人已经跑了
<10-4,Foreman>as Dr. Pujols called and said the patient ran off.

294
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,190
<10-5,House>拜托
<10-5,House>Come on.

295
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:26,930
<10-5,House>"便便池"
<10-5,House>"Poo holes."

296
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,050
<10-6,Foreman>我已经告知社会服务部门这一情况
<10-6,Foreman>I've informed Social Services of the mistake

297
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:31,710
<10-6,Foreman>并将无名病患的情况告知了警察
<10-6,Foreman>and given Jane Doe's description to the cops.

298
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:32,860
<10-6,Foreman>他们会去找她父母的
<10-6,Foreman>They'll track down the parents.

299
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:33,730
<10-7,Adams>谢谢你
<10-7,Adams>Thank you.

300
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,740
<10-7,Adams>那你和"愤侯"医生好好聊聊吧
<10-7,Adams>I'll leave you and Dr. "Pujols" alone.

301
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:38,620
<10-8,Foreman>你应该告知我
<10-8,Foreman>You should have told me

302
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,290
<10-8,Foreman>你在给未成年人治病
<10-8,Foreman>you were treating an underage clinic patient.

303
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:42,510
<10-9,House>我是想让你不知者无罪的
<10-9,House>I was giving you the gift of deniability.

304
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:44,830
<10-10,Foreman>作为回报  我给你加额外的门诊时间
<10-10,Foreman>Now I'm giving you the gift of additional clinic hours.

305
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:46,460
<10-11,House>不  你不能这么干
<10-11,House>No, you're not.

306
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,880
<10-12,Foreman>你没有我的把柄了
<10-12,Foreman>You've got nothing on me.

307
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,570
<10-12,Foreman>看看你的手机
<10-12,Foreman>Check your phone.

308
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,810
<10-12,Foreman>我的手机
<10-12,Foreman>Uh...my phone?

309
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,930
<10-13,House>哦  对啊  我
<10-13,House>Oh, right. Yes, I--

310
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:58,730
<10-13,House>我手机里的确有些照片
<10-13,House>I did have some pictures on that.

311
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,030
<10-13,House>但...
<10-13,House>But...

312
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:03,870
<10-13,House>我还有这些
<10-13,House>I also have these.

313
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:07,660
<10-13,House>这是你们俩晚餐时的热吻照片
<10-13,House>There's the two of you kissing over dinner.

314
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,980
<10-13,House>这是你们在夜店里动手动脚
<10-13,House>Busting a move in a night club.

315
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:12,780
<10-13,House>你瞧瞧你的手这是在哪啊
<10-13,House>Is that your hand near her nether regions?

316
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:17,150
<10-13,House>再次感谢你帮我摆脱脚踝追踪器
<10-13,House>Thanks again for taking off the ankle bracelet.

317
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,420
<10-14,Foreman>我不会让你要挟我的  豪斯
<10-14,Foreman>I'm not gonna let you blackmail me, House.

318
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:20,570
<10-14,Foreman>那是当然
<10-14,Foreman>Oh, of course not.

319
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,010
<10-15,House>因为你很耿直
<10-15,House>There's no way someone of your integrity

320
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,430
<10-15,House>所以不会因一点点的绯闻
<10-15,House>would let me compromise your job in any major way

321
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:26,920
<10-15,House>而在工作上大举让步于我
<10-15,House>over some tawdry bit of gossip.

322
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,370
<10-15,House>那小小妥协一下如何
<10-15,House>But what about compromising it in a minor way?

323
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,700
<10-10,Foreman>减少门诊时间
<10-10,Foreman>Reduced clinic hours.

324
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,780
<10-15,House>无上限网络色情片消费额
<10-15,House>Unlimited Internet porn budget.

325
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:37,760
<10-15,House>这比同时毁掉咱俩的生活
<10-15,House>That makes much more sense than the nuclear option

326
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,550
<10-15,House>要合理的多
<10-15,House>of ruining both our lives.

327
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,250
<10-15,House>这些你留着吧
<10-15,House>You can keep these.

328
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,870
<10-15,House>我有备份
<10-15,House>I got copies.

329
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:56,780
<11-1,House>真怀念把柄在握的美妙滋味啊
<11-1,House>How I miss the sweet smell of stickin' it to the man.

330
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,580
<11-2,Wilson>亚当斯是对的
<11-2,Wilson>Adams is right.

331
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,210
<11-2,Wilson>你是在保护这姑娘
<11-2,Wilson>You're protecting this girl.

332
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:02,790
<11-3,House>不  我错了
<11-3,House>No, I was wrong.

333
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,770
<11-3,House>我怀念的是说教的酸腐味
<11-3,House>It's the stench of moralizing.

334
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:08,220
<11-3,House>我是在保护自己  免受政府和家长的干涉
<11-3,House>I'm protecting myself from meddling bureaucrats and parents.

335
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,460
<11-4,Wilson>你喜欢这姑娘
<11-4,Wilson>You admire this girl.

336
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,130
<11-4,Wilson>她的家庭生活很悲惨
<11-4,Wilson>She had a horrible home life,

337
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:12,790
<11-4,Wilson>所以她离家出走  自己生活
<11-4,Wilson>so she went out on her own.

338
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:14,190
<11-4,Wilson>她走了你不敢走的路
<11-4,Wilson>She's your road not taken.

339
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:15,490
<11-5,House>我常常梦想自己住在
<11-5,House>I've always dreamed of living

340
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:17,130
<11-5,House>一座长满霉菌的荒废的房子里
<11-5,House>in an abandoned house with mold.

341
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:18,930
<11-6,Wilson>豪斯  我只是在说
<11-6,Wilson>House, all I'm accusing you of

342
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:20,810
<11-6,Wilson>你和病人产生了某种共鸣
<11-6,Wilson>is having a connection with a patient.

343
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:21,770
<11-6,Wilson>是件好事
<11-6,Wilson>This is a good thing.

344
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:23,770
<11-7,House>不是好事  因为根本就没这回事
<11-7,House>It's not a good thing, 'cause it's not a thing.

345
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:25,670
<11-8,Wilson>有  等她的父母到了
<11-8,Wilson>It is a thing... which she'll prove

346
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:27,240
<11-8,Wilson>你开始保护她
<11-8,Wilson>when her parents show up

347
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,100
<11-8,Wilson>一切就不言自明了
<11-8,Wilson>and you start protecting her from them.

348
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,100
<12-1,Taub>我的叫声是
<12-1,Taub>The sound I make is,

349
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,690
<12-1,Taub>"哞"
<12-1,Taub>moooo!

350
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:43,590
<12-1,Taub>我的叫声是
<12-1,Taub>The sound I make is,

351
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,380
<12-1,Taub>"呱呱呱"
<12-1,Taub>quack quack quack quack quack.

352
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,130
<12-1,Taub>哞
<12-1,Taub>Moo.

353
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,940
<12-1,Taub>这个声音是"呱"
<12-1,Taub>The sound is quack.

354
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,470
<12-1,Taub>我就是一混蛋
<12-1,Taub>I'm an ass.

355
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,240
<13-1,Taub>好处就是我可以用电话控制录像机了
<13-1,Taub>On the plus side, I can now program my DVR from my phone.

356
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:35,250
<13-2,Adams>他们是挺无趣的
<13-2,Adams>They are kind of boring.

357
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:37,980
<13-2,Adams>不只是你的  所有孩子都是
<13-2,Adams>All kids, not just yours.

358
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:38,930
<13-3,Taub>真安慰啊
<13-3,Taub>Very helpful.

359
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:40,870
<13-4,Adams>你得多跟她们相处
<13-4,Adams>You need to log more hours.

360
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:42,770
<13-4,Adams>最终  无趣褪去  形成感情牵绊
<13-4,Adams>Eventually, you'll pass boredom and get to bonding.

361
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,120
<13-4,Adams>有点像斯德哥尔摩症
<13-4,Adams>Kind of like Stockholm syndrome.

362
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,310
<13-5,Jane Doe>我听到护士的谈话了
<13-5,Jane Doe>I heard the nurses talking.

363
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:49,100
<13-5,Jane Doe>你真的打给社会服务部了
<13-5,Jane Doe>You called Social Services for real.

364
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,760
<13-6,Adams>因为你不该自己一个人住
<13-6,Adams>Because you shouldn't be living on your own.

365
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,350
<13-7,Jane Doe>没错  继续给我妈当出气包就好了
<13-7,Jane Doe>Right, better my mom should use me as a punching bag.

366
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,900
<13-8,Taub>如果你妈妈虐待你
<13-8,Taub>If your mom abused you,

367
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,080
<13-8,Taub>社会服务部不会让你和她住的
<13-8,Taub>Social Services won't let you go home with her.

368
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,310
<13-9,Jane Doe>我说过我不信任这个社会吗
<13-9,Jane Doe>Have I mentioned I don't trust the system?

369
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:01,300
<13-10,Adams>我们还不能判断你是否好转了
<13-10,Adams>We don't know if you're better yet.

370
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,690
<13-10,Adams>你现在不能走
<13-10,Adams>You can't just take off.

371
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,750
<13-11,Taub>有什么可以帮忙的吗
<13-11,Taub>Uh, can we help you?

372
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,890
<13-12,Brown>我是社会服务部的阿黛尔.布朗  这是...
<13-12,Brown>I'm Adele Brown from Social Services, and this is--

373
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:10,630
<13-13,Ellen>我是艾伦·罗杰斯
<13-13,Ellen>I'm Ellen Rogers.

374
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,240
<13-13,Ellen>凯莉的妈妈
<13-13,Ellen>Callie's mother.

375
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,880
<13-14,Callie>早在两年前你就不是我妈了
<13-14,Callie>You haven't been that for two years.

376
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,070
<13-15,Ellen>我保证...
<13-15,Ellen>I promise...

377
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:16,790
<13-15,Ellen>现在不一样了
<13-15,Ellen>Things are different.

378
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:19,540
<13-16,Callie>才说两句话  你就开始承诺了
<13-16,Callie>Two sentences in, and you're already making promises.

379
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,290
<13-17,Brown>让我们都冷静一下
<13-17,Brown>Okay, maybe we need to take a minute here

380
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:22,760
<13-17,Brown>给凯莉一些空间
<13-17,Brown>and give Callie some space.

381
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,070
<13-18,Callie>我不需要冷静  我要她滚出我的生活
<13-18,Callie>No, I don't need a minute. I need her out of my life.

382
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,380
<13-19,Ellen>她还好吗
<13-19,Ellen>Is she okay?

383
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:27,880
<13-20,Callie>我会好的只要你...
<13-20,Callie>I will be once you just...

384
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:30,380
<13-21,Ellen>天啊
<13-21,Ellen>Oh, my God!

385
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:32,800
<13-22,Taub>快来帮忙
<13-22,Taub>We need help in here!

386
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,600
<14-2,Announcer>-加油  -比赛开始
<14-2,Announcer>- Go! - And they're off!

387
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:45,070
<14-3,Adams>你在乌龟比赛上赌了一百块吗
<14-3,Adams>You bet 100 bucks on a turtle race?

388
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:47,840
<14-4,House>我付给乌龟"奇普斯"五块钱  让它假输
<14-4,House>I paid Mr. Chips 5 bucks to take a dive.

389
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,800
<14-5,Adams>流血自己停了
<14-5,Adams>The bleeding stopped on its own.

390
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,590
<14-5,Adams>注射类固醇后她的病情更严重了
<14-5,Adams>She got worse after being on steroids,

391
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:54,950
<14-5,Adams>所以不是自身免疫病
<14-5,Adams>so autoimmune is out.

392
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,710
<14-6,Park>诊断结果取决于出血是来自她的鼻窦
<14-6,Park>Diagnosis depends on whether the blood was coming from

393
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:59,160
<14-6,Park>肺  还是消化道
<14-6,Park>the sinuses, lungs, or her guts.

394
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,630
<14-6,Park>奇普斯看起来求胜欲不小
<14-6,Park>Mr. Chips looks like he wants it.

395
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:05,280
<14-6,Park>赌一百块它会大胜富兰克林
<14-6,Park>100 bucks says he'll make soup out of Franklin.

396
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,370
<14-7,House>放马过来吧
<14-7,House>You're on.

397
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,830
<14-8,Adams>你觉得那个妈妈怎么样
<14-8,Adams>How'd the mom seem to you?

398
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:12,210
<14-9,House>如果你是想问他那个女人长得
<14-9,House>If you're asking him if she looks like someone

399
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:14,220
<14-9,House>像不像打孩子的主  你就太蠢了
<14-9,House>who beat her kid, you're a moron.

400
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,880
<14-10,Parks>奇普斯老龟  出击啊
<14-10,Parks>Move your ass, Mr. Chips!

401
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:36,800
<14-11,Adams>你该看看她看到她妈走进来时的表情
<14-11,Adams>You should have seen her face when mom walked in.

402
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,780
<14-11,Adams>凯莉恨她妈妈  我觉得她没说谎
<14-11,Adams>Callie hates her. I don't think she's lying.

403
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:41,410
<14-12,Chase>因为人们从不对自己讨厌的人添油加醋
<14-12,Chase>Because people never lie about people they hate.

404
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:44,210
<14-12,Chase>大量鼻窦出血可能是鼻窦炎外加出血性疾病
<14-12,Chase>Big sinus bleed could be sinusitis and a bleeding disorder.

405
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:45,590
<14-13,Taub>她没有头痛
<14-13,Taub>She didn't complain about a headache.

406
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:46,710
<14-14,Adams>出血是在她的消化道
<14-14,Adams>The bleeding is in her gut.

407
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,910
<14-14,Adams>可能是卓-安式综合征
<14-14,Adams>Could be Zollinger-Ellison.

408
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,190
<14-14,Adams>反酸导致了哮喘
<14-14,Adams>Acid reflux causes asthma,

409
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:52,940
<14-14,Adams>胃酸侵蚀了胃壁  导致了出血
<14-14,Adams>and the acid erodes the stomach, causing the bleeding.

410
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,280
<14-14,Adams>好的
<14-14,Adams>Yes!

411
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:58,000
<14-15,House>富兰克林赢了
<14-15,House>Franklin rules.

412
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,050
<14-15,House>奇普斯惨败
<14-15,House>Mr. Chips drools.

413
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:03,840
<14-15,House>奇普斯的主人只喂它苹果和香蕉
<14-15,House>Mr. Chips's owner only feeds him on apples and bananas.

414
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,150
<14-15,House>严重缺乏维他命A
<14-15,House>Nowhere near enough vitamin A.

415
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,070
<14-15,House>付钱吧
<14-15,House>Pay up.

416
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:07,390
<14-15,House>做个上消化道内窥镜检查
<14-15,House>And do an upper endoscopy

417
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:09,420
<14-15,House>确认一下是否为卓-安式综合征
<14-15,House>to confirm for Zollinger-Ellison,

418
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:11,570
<14-15,House>先征求亲爱妈咪的同意
<14-15,House>after mommie dearest has given her permission.

419
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,950
<14-16,Adams>如果艾伦打孩子  她不会同意的
<14-16,Adams>Ellen shouldn't have consent if she beat her daughter.

420
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,770
<14-17,House>她打不打孩子不重要
<14-17,House>Doesn't matter if she beat her daughter.

421
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:19,340
<14-17,House>唯一重要的是社会服务部怎么看
<14-17,House>Only matters if Social Services says she beat her daughter.

422
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:22,210
<14-17,House>这就是官方接手的好处
<14-17,House>Good thing you made it all official.

423
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:27,870
<15-1,Ellen>内窥镜检查痛吗
<15-1,Ellen>Will the endoscopy be painful?

424
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:29,300
<15-2,Adams>你会担心这个吗
<15-2,Adams>Is that an issue?

425
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:32,610
<15-2,Adams>这是医疗检查
<15-2,Adams>It's a medical procedure.

426
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:34,330
<15-2,Adams>会引起不适
<15-2,Adams>There will be some discomfort.

427
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:36,530
<15-3,Ellen>我从没想过伤害我的女儿
<15-3,Ellen>I never meant to hurt my daughter.

428
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,430
<15-4,Adams>但你打了她
<15-4,Adams>And yet you hit her.

429
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,410
<15-5,Ellen>她这么告诉你的吗
<15-5,Ellen>She told you that?

430
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:43,850
<15-6,Adams>而你现在要告诉我你没有了
<15-6,Adams>And now you're gonna tell me you didn't.

431
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:47,360
<15-7,Ellen>我有毒瘾
<15-7,Ellen>I'm a drug addict.

432
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,980
<15-7,Ellen>我也是个很差劲的母亲
<15-7,Ellen>And I've been a lousy mom.

433
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:54,640
<15-7,Ellen>特别是在我丈夫死后
<15-7,Ellen>Especially since my husband died.

434
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,270
<15-7,Ellen>他和凯莉比我和她更亲近
<15-7,Ellen>I mean, he was closer to Callie than I was,

435
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:59,030
<15-7,Ellen>我想念他
<15-7,Ellen>and I missed him...

436
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:00,430
<15-7,Ellen>非常想念他
<15-7,Ellen>So much.

437
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,460
<15-7,Ellen>这一切对我来说太难了
<15-7,Ellen>And it was too hard.

438
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,010
<15-7,Ellen>吸毒...
<15-7,Ellen>And taking oxy just...

439
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,960
<15-7,Ellen>让我觉得生活没那么艰难了
<15-7,Ellen>made things easier.

440
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:10,960
<15-7,Ellen>直到我失去了我的女儿
<15-7,Ellen>Right up until it made me lose my daughter.

441
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:15,310
<15-7,Ellen>我伤凯莉伤得很深
<15-7,Ellen>I hurt Callie a lot.

442
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,300
<15-7,Ellen>但我唯一欣慰的事情
<15-7,Ellen>But one of the only things that I can feel okay about

443
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:22,040
<15-7,Ellen>就是我从没打过她
<15-7,Ellen>is that I never hit her.

444
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:34,750
<16-1,Anita>没想到你还是个中午找乐子的主
<16-1,Anita>Didn't peg you as the midday fun kind of guy.

445
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,460
<16-1,Anita>很高兴你是
<16-1,Anita>So glad I was wrong.

446
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:43,200
<16-2,Foreman>遗憾的是  这不是我们在这儿的原因
<16-2,Foreman>Unfortunately, that's not why we're here.

447
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:48,090
<16-2,Foreman>还记得昨天在餐馆遇到的那个人吗
<16-2,Foreman>Remember that guy from the restaurant yesterday?

448
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:54,080
<16-4,Foreman>他拍了我们的照片
<16-4,Foreman>He's got pictures of us.

449
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,790
<16-4,Foreman>他威胁要把照片拿给你丈夫看
<16-4,Foreman>He's threatening to show your husband.

450
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:58,790
<16-5,Anita>我记得你说他是你手下最好的医生之一
<16-5,Anita>I thought you said that guy was one of your best doctors.

451
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:00,450
<16-6,Foreman>没错  但他不是什么好人
<16-6,Foreman>Yeah, not one of my best people.

452
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,450
<16-6,Foreman>我们不能再见面了
<16-6,Foreman>We've gotta stop seeing each other.

453
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,660
<16-7,Anita>不用这么紧张
<16-7,Anita>Not necessarily.

454
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,920
<16-7,Anita>我早告诉我丈夫这事儿了
<16-7,Anita>I told my husband about you.

455
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:12,410
<16-8,Foreman>什么
<16-8,Foreman>What?

456
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:13,900
<16-8,Foreman>为什么啊
<16-8,Foreman>Why?

457
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,810
<16-9,Anita>他说最近我和他之间的关系改善了
<16-9,Anita>He was saying that things had been better lately

458
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:19,470
<16-9,Anita>我更高兴了
<16-9,Anita>between him and I, that I was happier.

459
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:21,430
<16-9,Anita>我说我确实是
<16-9,Anita>I said that I was.

460
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:23,370
<16-9,Anita>而你就是原因
<16-9,Anita>And that you were the reason.

461
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:27,370
<16-10,Foreman>而...他也没意见吗
<16-10,Foreman>And...he was okay with that?

462
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:28,410
<16-11,Anita>刚开始有意见
<16-11,Anita>Not initially.

463
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:30,220
<16-11,Anita>经过了一次艰难的谈话
<16-11,Anita>It was a pretty tough conversation.

464
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:32,990
<16-11,Anita>我们都还没准备好离婚
<16-11,Anita>Neither of us is ready to give up on the marriage.

465
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:35,620
<16-11,Anita>我也不准备放弃你
<16-11,Anita>And I am not ready to give up this.

466
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,740
<16-11,Anita>你不用再觉得有罪恶感了
<16-11,Anita>You don't have to feel so guilty anymore.

467
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:57,920
<17-1,House>你根本不用朝自己开枪的
<17-1,House>You didn't need to shoot yourself.

468
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,820
<17-1,House>我可以直接让你被开除军籍
<17-1,House>I could have given you a Section 8.

469
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:03,010
<17-2,George>我们训练强度太大了
<17-2,George>We've hit the drills pretty hard,

470
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:04,730
<17-2,George>到第四轮的时候  我的手不听使唤了
<17-2,George>and by the fourth round, my hand went numb.

471
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,230
<17-2,George>枪滑落了  然后...
<17-2,George>The gun slipped and...

472
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,670
<17-2,George>枪里装的是空包弹  但是...
<17-2,George>I only had blanks in it, but...

473
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:09,930
<17-3,House>真有趣  你差点射掉脚趾
<17-3,House>It's funny how nearly shooting your toe off

474
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:11,710
<17-3,House>但却治好了语言困难症
<17-3,House>cured that speech impediment.

475
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,600
<17-4,George>那个啊  很抱歉
<17-4,George>Ah. Yeah. Sorry about that.

476
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,270
<17-4,George>谢尔登是个激进派
<17-4,George>Sheldon's a...progressive.

477
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:18,150
<17-5,House>像谁呢
<17-5,House>Eh, compared to who?

478
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,030
<17-5,House>鲁伯特·默多克吗[新闻集团总裁]
<17-5,House>Rupert Murdoch?

479
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:20,860
<17-6,George>激进派是些在重演历史过程中
<17-6,George>Progressives are reenactors

480
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:22,390
<17-6,George>追求完全逼真的一群人
<17-6,George>who strive for complete authenticity.

481
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:25,020
<17-6,George>只要穿着戏服他们就保持入戏状态
<17-6,George>They never drop character while in uniform.

482
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:27,980
<17-7,House>这么看来你还没有那么疯狂
<17-7,House>Whereas you just dabble in crazy.

483
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:32,360
<17-8,George>几年前我和谢尔登吵翻了
<17-8,George>Sheldon and I had a big falling out years ago.

484
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,060
<17-8,George>全是因为这些重演活动
<17-8,George>We only really started talking again

485
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,250
<17-8,George>我们才又开始说话了
<17-8,George>because of the reenactments.

486
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,720
<17-8,George>这些活动
<17-8,George>They, uh...

487
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:39,710
<17-8,George>让我和兄弟和好如初
<17-8,George>gave me my brother back.

488
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:41,430
<17-9,House>你这故事太感人了
<17-9,House>That's a very moving story.

489
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:42,820
<17-9,House>要不是你们俩参与这么个破活动
<17-9,House>Be a lot more affecting if you hadn't

490
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,290
<17-9,House>你们的故事会更打动人
<17-9,House>bonded over something so completely idiotic.

491
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:53,860
<18-1,Adams>你妈妈没打过你  是吗
<18-1,Adams>Your mom didn't hit you, did she?

492
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:56,960
<18-2,Callie>没有
<18-2,Callie>No.

493
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:58,880
<18-3,Adams>那你为什么说谎呢
<18-3,Adams>Then why'd you lie about it?

494
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:03,990
<18-4,Callie>因为我想要离开这里
<18-4,Callie>Because I wanted to get out of here.

495
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,440
<18-4,Callie>相比我妈的所作所为
<18-4,Callie>People understand getting hit

496
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,030
<18-4,Callie>说挨打更容易为别人理解
<18-4,Callie>more than what my mom does.

497
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:11,180
<18-5,Adams>告诉我  说不定我能理解
<18-5,Adams>Tell me. Maybe I'll understand.

498
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:16,230
<18-6,Callie>当娘的活儿全是我干的
<18-6,Callie>Well, I was the mom.

499
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,280
<18-6,Callie>她保不住工作
<18-6,Callie>She couldn't keep a job.

500
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:21,820
<18-6,Callie>花光积蓄嗑药
<18-6,Callie>She'd spend all her money on pills.

501
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:23,450
<18-6,Callie>我只好去找工作
<18-6,Callie>I had to get a job.

502
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,040
<18-6,Callie>加班加点  勉强保证家里的水电煤
<18-6,Callie>Double shifts, just to keep the power on.

503
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,530
<18-6,Callie>保证我们有东西吃
<18-6,Callie>Keep food in the house.

504
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,640
<18-6,Callie>数不清有多少次她差点吸毒过量
<18-6,Callie>I couldn't tell you how many times she nearly O.D.ed

505
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,200
<18-6,Callie>我得帮她擦洗干净  服侍她上床
<18-6,Callie>and I had to clean her up and put her in bed.

506
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:39,370
<18-6,Callie>最后我决定了  如果要当个大人
<18-6,Callie>So I decided, if I was gonna be the grown-up,

507
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,220
<18-6,Callie>我宁愿为自己而活
<18-6,Callie>I'd rather do it on my own terms.

508
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,150
<18-7,Adams>你妈知道她不象样
<18-7,Adams>Your mom knows she messed up.

509
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,140
<18-7,Adams>她决定要洗心革面
<18-7,Adams>She's determined not to do it again.

510
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,320
<18-7,Adams>好吧
<18-7,Adams>Yeah.

511
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,600
<18-8,Callie>她会想要洗心革面
<18-8,Callie>And she'll feel that way,

512
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,220
<18-8,Callie>直到遇到困难克服不了
<18-8,Callie>right up until things get too tough

513
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:00,870
<18-8,Callie>她又会重新开始吸毒
<18-8,Callie>and she has to start using again.

514
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:12,190
<19-1,Adams>你觉得人会改变吗
<19-1,Adams>Do you think people can change?

515
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,710
<19-1,Adams>不会
<19-1,Adams>No.

516
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:16,330
<19-2,Chase>但我知道这么说改变不了你的看法
<19-2,Chase>But I don't think that's gonna change your opinion,

517
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:19,110
<19-2,Chase>因为  人不会改变
<19-2,Chase>because... people don't change.

518
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:24,170
<19-3,Adams>停下
<19-3,Adams>Stop.

519
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,300
<19-3,Adams>-那是溃疡吗  -是的
<19-3,Adams>- Is that an ulcer? - Yeah, it is.

520
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:27,740
<19-4,Chase>但还没到胃部
<19-4,Chase>But we haven't reached the stomach yet.

521
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:29,610
<19-4,Chase>还在食道中
<19-4,Chase>I'm still high in the esophagus.

522
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:31,210
<19-4,Chase>说明不是卓-艾氏综合症
<19-4,Chase>Means it's not Zollinger-Ellison.

523
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:34,550
<19-5,Adams>溃疡出血了
<19-5,Adams>Ulcer's bleeding.

524
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,850
<19-6,Chase>得快清洗免得她被血呛着
<19-6,Chase>We need to lavage before she drowns in her own blood.

525
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,390
<20-1,Chase>我们灼平了溃疡  止住了出血
<20-1,Chase>Cauterized the ulcer, stopped the bleeding.

526
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,270
<20-2,Taub>露宿街头让她的免疫系统受损
<20-2,Taub>Compromised immune system from living on the street

527
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:46,870
<20-2,Taub>使她容易感染人类乳头状病毒
<20-2,Taub>could have made her susceptible to HPV.

528
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:48,530
<20-3,Adams>人类乳头状病毒在性病筛查时检查过了
<20-3,Adams>HPV was covered on the STD panel.

529
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,460
<20-3,Adams>结果是阴性的
<20-3,Adams>She's negative.

530
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:51,430
<20-3,Adams>要是这病不是因为无家可归呢
<20-3,Adams>What if she didn't get this from being homeless?

531
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:52,670
<20-3,Adams>要是是从她妈那边得来的呢
<20-3,Adams>What if she got it from her mom?

532
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:55,080
<20-4,Park>我想你应该是在说基因类的疾病  因为...
<20-4,Park>I'm assuming you're thinking something genetic, because...

533
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,430
<20-5,Adams>我在考虑酒瘾
<20-5,Adams>I'm thinking addiction.

534
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,410
<20-5,Adams>酒精引起的食道炎
<20-5,Adams>Alcohol-induced esophagitis.

535
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:01,530
<20-6,Chase>解释得通食道溃疡和其它症状
<20-6,Chase>Explains esophageal ulcers and her other symptoms.

536
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:02,460
<20-7,House>那怎么解释
<20-7,House>If only it would explain

537
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:03,800
<20-7,House>为什么没见过她醉酒
<20-7,House>why we've never seen her drunk,

538
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:05,130
<20-7,House>喝酒或是戒断反应呢
<20-7,House>drinking, or detoxing.

539
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,820
<20-8,Adams>她的血压有点高
<20-8,Adams>Her blood pressure's been elevated.

540
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:07,800
<20-8,Adams>可能是谵妄型震颤
<20-8,Adams>Could be the DTs.

541
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:09,150
<20-9,Taub>是稍微有点高
<20-9,Taub>It's been mildly elevated.

542
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,640
<20-9,Taub>轻微高血压
<20-9,Taub>Mildly elevated BP

543
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:13,160
<20-10,House>可能导致脑底动脉瘤
<20-10,House>could put her at risk of a Berry Aneurysm.

544
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,080
<20-10,House>脑部纤细的血管
<20-10,House>Weak blood vessel in the brain

545
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:17,030
<20-10,House>受到轻微高血压的冲击
<20-10,House>gets pounded on by elevated BP,

546
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:19,950
<20-10,House>不停地收缩扩张
<20-10,House>causes it to expand and contract.

547
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:22,050
<20-10,House>导致症状时有时无
<20-10,House>Causes the symptoms to come and go.

548
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,120
<20-11,Adams>CT看不出有动脉瘤的迹象
<20-11,Adams>CT didn't show any signs of an aneurysm.

549
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:25,900
<20-12,House>我提过动脉瘤会时有时无吗
<20-12,House>Did I mention they come and go?

550
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,600
<20-12,House>虽然你的存在
<20-12,House>Much as your presence may cause

551
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,490
<20-12,House>足以让有些器官充血
<20-12,House>objects to become engorged with blood,

552
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:31,860
<20-12,House>但有些时候动脉瘤们就是没那个心情
<20-12,House>sometimes aneurysms just aren't in the mood.

553
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,300
<20-13,Adams>酗酒和脑底动脉瘤
<20-13,Adams>Alcoholism and Berry Aneurysm

554
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,390
<20-13,Adams>都有可能
<20-13,Adams>are both valid theories.

555
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:36,460
<20-13,Adams>我觉得我们该和病人及她妈讨论下
<20-13,Adams>I think we should discuss this with the patient and her mom.

556
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:37,880
<20-14,House>何必呢  我们这不是讨论过了嘛
<20-14,House>Why? We discussed it right here.

557
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:40,090
<20-14,House>告诉她们要做个脑血管造影图
<20-14,House>Go tell 'em she needs a cerebral angiogram

558
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:41,340
<20-14,House>来确认动脉瘤的位置
<20-14,House>to locate the aneurysm,

559
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:43,390
<20-14,House>然后通过手术切除
<20-14,House>then surgery to repair.

560
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:47,130
<21-1,Callie>要做脑手术
<21-1,Callie>Brain surgery?

561
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:48,370
<21-1,Callie>什么时候
<21-1,Callie>When?

562
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:50,980
<21-2,Taub>我们预定了一个小时后的手术室
<21-2,Taub>We booked the O.R. for an hour from now.

563
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:54,520
<21-3,Ellen>豪斯医生肯定她得的是这个病吗
<21-3,Ellen>And Dr. House is sure that's what she has?

564
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,860
<21-4,Taub>他对诊断很有自信
<21-4,Taub>He's confident in the diagnosis.

565
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:57,860
<21-4,Taub>符合她所有的症状
<21-4,Taub>It's consistent with all of her symptoms.

566
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,860
<21-5,Callie>但你有不同意见
<21-5,Callie>But you don't buy it.

567
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,240
<21-5,Callie>是的
<21-5,Callie>No.

568
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:07,080
<21-6,Adams>我认为你的症状是由于
<21-6,Adams>I think your symptoms are the result

569
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,530
<21-6,Adams>酗酒造成的
<21-6,Adams>of alcohol abuse.

570
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,450
<21-7,Callie>我没有酗酒
<21-7,Callie>But I'm not, I'm not an alcoholic.

571
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:13,270
<21-8,Adams>你来医院的时候包里带着啤酒
<21-8,Adams>You came to the hospital with beer in your pocket.

572
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,900
<21-8,Adams>我们在你住处又找到很多酒
<21-8,Adams>We found more alcohol at your house.

573
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:16,320
<21-9,Callie>我用酒来付账
<21-9,Callie>Yeah, I use booze as payment.

574
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:18,390
<21-9,Callie>偶尔也喝朋友喝喝啤酒
<21-9,Callie>I have an occasional beer with my friends.

575
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:20,870
<21-9,Callie>这并不说明我有酗酒的问题啊
<21-9,Callie>That doesn't mean I have a problem.

576
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:26,070
<21-9,Callie>我要做那个手术
<21-9,Callie>I want the surgery.

577
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,430
<21-10,Taub>实际上  决定权在你妈手上
<21-10,Taub>Actually, it's your mom's decision.

578
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,910
<21-11,Callie>我没有酒瘾
<21-11,Callie>I'm not an addict.

579
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,820
<21-12,Ellen>凯莉  我以前也一直这么对你说
<21-12,Ellen>That's what I always said to you, Callie,

580
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:41,760
<21-12,Ellen>-但我确实有问题  -我不是你
<21-12,Ellen>- but I had a problem. - I'm nothing like you!

581
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:47,660
<21-13,Callie>让他们给我做手术
<21-13,Callie>Tell them to do the surgery.

582
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:55,510
<21-14,Ellen>给我点时间考虑下
<21-14,Ellen>I need a few minutes to think.

583
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,120
<22-1,Adams>病人问我的想法是什么
<22-1,Adams>The patient asked me what I thought.

584
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:05,350
<22-2,House>我付你工资是让你在这间办公室里有想法
<22-2,House>I pay you to think inside this room.

585
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:06,940
<22-2,House>在外面你只要复述我的话就可以了
<22-2,House>Outside this room, I pay you to parrot.

586
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:09,180
<22-3,Adams>这是她的选择  她有权知道真相
<22-3,Adams>It's her choice. She has the right to know!

587
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,470
<22-3,Adams>这只是个医学上的选择
<22-3,Adams>It's a medical choice

588
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:11,840
<22-4,House>你却硬要把选择牵扯成
<22-4,House>that you turned into an extension

589
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,500
<22-4,House>你和她的意见
<22-4,House>of your baggage and hers.

590
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,300
<22-4,House>你告诉她妈你所想要相信的事情
<22-4,House>You told the mom something you want to believe

591
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,130
<22-4,House>因为你不愿相信
<22-4,House>because you don't want to believe

592
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:18,570
<22-4,House>这个女孩在没有父母监护的环境下会活得很好
<22-4,House>that this girl might be doing fine parent-free.

593
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:20,090
<22-4,House>正好她妈也是这么考虑的
<22-4,House>Which also happens to be what the mom wants to believe.

594
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:21,990
<22-5,Adams>你觉得她愿意为
<22-5,Adams>You think she wants to feel responsible

595
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:22,690
<22-5,Adams>女儿的病负责任吗
<22-5,Adams>for her daughter's illness?

596
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:25,570
<22-6,House>那女人把她女儿所有的遭遇
<22-6,House>That woman sees everything to do with her daughter through...

597
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:27,630
<22-6,House>都归咎于自己
<22-6,House>guilt-colored glasses.

598
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:29,360
<22-6,House>都是她的错
<22-6,House>It's all her fault.

599
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,980
<23-1,Ellen>豪斯
<23-1,Ellen>House...

600
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,890
<22-7,Adams>你别去骂她
<22-7,Adams>Don't...bully her.

601
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,060
<22-7,Adams>她现在已经受够了
<22-7,Adams>She's overwhelmed enough.

602
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,810
<22-8,House>当她女儿因为她的错误选择
<22-8,House>It's nothing compared to what she will feel

603
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:46,560
<22-8,House>而死于动脉瘤的时候
<22-8,House>when her daughter dies from the aneurysm

604
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,010
<22-8,House>更有她受得了
<22-8,House>she decided not to treat.

605
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,370
<23-1,Ellen>你就是豪斯医生吧
<23-1,Ellen>You must be Dr. House.

606
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:12,090
<23-2,House>我只有在
<23-2,House>I save my appearances

607
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:14,470
<23-2,House>病人父母将要做愚蠢至极的事情前
<23-2,House>for when parents are on the brink of doing something

608
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:16,960
<23-2,House>才会露面
<23-2,House>incredibly stupid.

609
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,810
<23-2,House>你女儿得了脑底动脉瘤
<23-2,House>Your daughter has a Berry Aneurysm.

610
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,780
<23-2,House>她需要动手术
<23-2,House>She needs surgery.

611
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:24,130
<23-2,House>她不需要你
<23-2,House>What she does not need is you making this

612
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:26,180
<23-2,House>来做替她做决定
<23-2,House>or any other decision.

613
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:29,050
<23-3,Ellen>我不能
<23-3,Ellen>Well, I can't just

614
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,340
<23-3,Ellen>让她做这个决定
<23-3,Ellen>leave this up to her.

615
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:31,850
<23-4,House>那把决定权给我
<23-4,House>Then leave it up to me,

616
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:34,050
<23-4,House>你可以走了
<23-4,House>and just leave.

617
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,440
<23-5,Ellen>我不会抛弃我女儿的
<23-5,Ellen>I'm not gonna abandon my daughter.

618
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:40,750
<23-6,House>她恨你
<23-6,House>She hates you.

619
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,440
<23-6,House>那倒不是什么大问题
<23-6,House>It's actually not such a big deal.

620
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:48,240
<23-6,House>很多孩子都恨他们的父母
<23-6,House>There's plenty of kids who hate their parents.

621
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:51,340
<23-6,House>重要的是她有理由恨你
<23-6,House>What makes it a big deal is that she should hate you.

622
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:56,200
<23-6,House>打亲血牌什么都改变不了
<23-6,House>Playing the biology card doesn't change anything

623
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,350
<23-6,House>除了能决定她该住哪
<23-6,House>except where she lives.

624
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:00,930
<23-6,House>没有你你女儿过得更好
<23-6,House>Your daughter is better off without you.

625
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:04,400
<23-6,House>所以...让她自己好好过吧
<23-6,House>So...let her be better off without you.

626
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:11,420
<23-6,House>我要去给她做手术了
<23-6,House>I'm gonna do the surgery.

627
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:13,940
<23-6,House>我会解决社会服务部门的遗留问题
<23-6,House>I'll take the fallout from Social Services.

628
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:35,130
<23-1,Ellen>豪斯医生
<23-1,Ellen>Dr. House!

629
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:46,620
<24-1,Ellen>关心我女儿是我的选择
<24-1,Ellen>My daughter's care is my choice.

630
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:48,930
<24-1,Ellen>这也是
<24-1,Ellen>And so is this.

631
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:51,090
<24-1,Ellen>按酗酒者治疗她
<24-1,Ellen>Treat her for alcoholism.

632
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,070
<25-1,Chase>安妮塔为什么要
<25-1,Chase>Why would Anita

633
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:01,350
<25-2,Foreman>告诉她丈夫我们偷情的事
<25-2,Foreman>tell her husband about our affair?

634
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:03,460
<25-3,Chase>也许是不想再撒谎了
<25-3,Chase>Probably just got sick of lying.

635
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,180
<25-3,Chase>你应该这么想
<25-3,Chase>Look at it this way.

636
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:07,460
<25-3,Chase>现在你跟她滚床单既不用负责也不用内疚了
<25-3,Chase>Now the sex is both commitment- and guilt-free.

637
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:10,920
<25-3,Chase>男人都喜欢不用负责的性爱
<25-3,Chase>And men love commitment-free sex.

638
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:13,230
<25-3,Chase>没错  他们就是这样
<25-3,Chase>Yes, they do.

639
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:14,510
<25-3,Chase>没错  他们就是这样
<25-3,Chase>Oh, yes, they do!

640
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,820
<25-3,Chase>她们最终也会明白的
<25-3,Chase>They're gonna find out eventually.

641
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:24,110
<25-4,Taub>你怎么能不断重复做着一件事
<25-4,Taub>How do you keep doing the same thing over and over

642
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,600
<25-4,Taub>还保持同样的热情呢
<25-4,Taub>with the same level of enthusiasm?

643
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:28,080
<25-5,Chase>首先  要做一个正直的考虑别人感受的人
<25-5,Chase>First off, be a decent, empathetic person.

644
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:30,590
<25-5,Chase>你说过这正是你想要的
<25-5,Chase>This is what you said you wanted,

645
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:31,570
<25-5,Chase>但她丈夫知道后
<25-5,Chase>but you're actually more upset

646
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:32,790
<25-5,Chase>你反而更沮丧了
<25-5,Chase>now that her husband knows.

647
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:34,710
<25-6,Foreman>-因为我在伤害他  -以前也是
<25-6,Foreman>- 'Cause I'm hurting him. - You always were.

648
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,840
<25-7,Taub>没错  但那时他不知道
<25-7,Taub>Yeah, but he didn't know that.

649
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:37,910
<25-8,Foreman>那意味着他并没有真正意义上的受伤
<25-8,Foreman>Which means he wasn't really hurt.

650
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,180
<25-8,Foreman>我知道这只是自欺欺人
<25-8,Foreman>Yeah, I know it's a rationalization,

651
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,100
<25-8,Foreman>但我花了好久才
<25-8,Foreman>but it went a long way

652
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:42,570
<25-8,Foreman>稍微感觉...
<25-8,Foreman>to making me feel...

653
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:44,020
<25-8,Foreman>和她约会没那么内疚了
<25-8,Foreman>A little less guilty about seeing her.

654
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:44,990
<25-9,Chase>看来你得找个更好的理由
<25-9,Chase>Looks like you're gonna need

655
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,520
<25-9,Chase>来说服自己了
<25-9,Chase>a bigger rationalization.

656
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:54,440
<26-1,Adams>社会服务部门发来了你母亲的报告
<26-1,Adams>Social Services report came in on your mom.

657
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:55,580
<26-2,Callie>让我猜猜
<26-2,Callie>Ah, let me guess.

658
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,840
<26-2,Callie>她高分通过了
<26-2,Callie>She passed with flying colors.

659
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:00,650
<26-2,Callie>她总这样
<26-2,Callie>She always does.

660
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:03,930
<26-3,Adams>我认为她这次是认真的
<26-3,Adams>I think she might make it this time.

661
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:06,880
<26-3,Adams>豪斯留下一瓶维科丁
<26-3,Adams>House left a bottle of Vicodin

662
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:08,550
<26-3,Adams>想看看她是否会偷走
<26-3,Adams>to see if she'd steal it.

663
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,920
<26-3,Adams>她还了回去
<26-3,Adams>She gave it back.

664
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:17,060
<26-3,Adams>你至少可以让她在这里睡
<26-3,Adams>You could at least let her sleep in the room.

665
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:20,260
<26-4,Callie>关于喝酒的事她本该相信我
<26-4,Callie>She could have listened to me about my drinking.

666
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,580
<26-4,Callie>我的意思是就算你是对的
<26-4,Callie>I mean, even if you are right about it,

667
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:23,250
<26-4,Callie>为什么她信你不信我
<26-4,Callie>why take your word over mine?

668
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,970
<26-4,Callie>我是她女儿
<26-4,Callie>I'm her daughter.

669
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,860
<26-4,Callie>因为...
<26-4,Callie>Because it...

670
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:29,790
<26-5,Adams>她是你母亲
<26-5,Adams>She's your mom.

671
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:32,630
<26-5,Adams>而且这是第一次她表现得像个母亲
<26-5,Adams>And, for the first time, she's acting like it.

672
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,590
<26-6,Callie>已经有点晚了
<26-6,Callie>It's a little late for that.

673
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:42,970
<26-6,Callie>晚安
<26-6,Callie>Good night.

674
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,270
<26-7,House>早上好
<26-7,House>Morning!

675
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:03,030
<26-8,Wilson>我听说你去和那母亲面对面的交流了
<26-8,Wilson>I heard you went head-to-head with the mom.

676
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,490
<26-9,House>不是为了你想的理由
<26-9,House>Not for your reasons.

677
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:05,770
<26-10,Wilson>你是在保护那女孩
<26-10,Wilson>You're protecting the girl.

678
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,120
<26-11,House>我是在捍卫我的诊断结果
<26-11,House>I'm protecting my diagnosis.

679
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:08,370
<26-12,Wilson>你还试探她
<26-12,Wilson>And you tested her--

680
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,570
<26-12,Wilson>是想知道她是否会重新沾上毒品
<26-12,Wilson>see if you could get her back on drugs

681
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:10,740
<26-12,Wilson>并再次离开她女儿
<26-12,Wilson>and out of her daughter's life.

682
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:12,940
<26-13,House>那是为了向亚当斯证明妈妈的最爱
<26-13,House>That was to show Adams that mommie dearest

683
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,250
<26-13,House>从来没有变过
<26-13,House>hadn't changed.

684
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:17,740
<26-13,House>我坚决反对这类理想主义
<26-13,House>I'm taking a principled stand against idealism.

685
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:20,200
<26-14,Wilson>你的病人还稳定吗
<26-14,Wilson>Your patient's stable?

686
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,000
<26-14,Wilson>也许亚当斯是对的
<26-14,Wilson>Well, maybe Adams was right.

687
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,720
<26-14,Wilson>病因与酒精有关
<26-14,Wilson>The illness is alcohol-related.

688
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:25,060
<26-15,House>但愿如此
<26-15,House>Well, I hope so,

689
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,840
<26-15,House>考虑到我们正在以此为根据进行治疗
<26-15,House>considering it's what we're treating her for.

690
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:29,480
<26-16,Wilson>你居然为了病人
<26-16,Wilson>You--you hope you're wrong

691
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:32,150
<26-16,Wilson>希望自己是错的
<26-16,Wilson>for the sake of the patient?

692
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:34,090
<26-17,House>我希望我是对的
<26-17,House>I hope that I'm right

693
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:36,820
<26-17,House>但也希望动脉瘤破裂不会杀死她
<26-17,House>but the aneurism bursts without killing her.

694
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:38,810
<26-17,House>我就是如此软弱
<26-17,House>Call me a softie.

695
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,040
<26-17,House>或者她母亲同意我进行尸检
<26-17,House>Or the mom agrees to an autopsy

696
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,500
<26-17,House>让我证明我是对的也行
<26-17,House>so I can prove it.

697
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:52,870
<26-18,Taub>你的病人们喜欢你因为你富有同情心
<26-18,Taub>Your patients love you because you're empathetic.

698
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:57,350
<26-19,Wilson>我也有双善良的眼睛
<26-19,Wilson>I also have kind eyes.

699
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,130
<26-19,Wilson>你为什么在这
<26-19,Wilson>Why are you here?

700
00:31:58,130 --> 00:32:00,210
<26-20,Taub>但你并不喜欢你所有的病人对吧
<26-20,Taub>But you don't love all your patients?

701
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,480
<26-21,Wilson>当然不
<26-21,Wilson>Of course not.

702
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:06,140
<26-22,Taub>我打赌有些也会让你觉得无聊
<26-22,Taub>I'll--I'll bet some of them bore you.

703
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:07,780
<26-23,Wilson>无趣的人也会得癌症
<26-23,Wilson>Dull people get cancer too.

704
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:08,560
<26-23,Wilson>你为什么在这
<26-23,Wilson>Why are you here?

705
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,840
<26-24,Taub>但你...假装对他们感兴趣
<26-24,Taub>But you...fake an interest in them

706
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,440
<26-24,Taub>因为你必须这样做  是吗
<26-24,Taub>because you needed to, right?

707
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,970
<26-24,Taub>而且如果你装的时间足够长
<26-24,Taub>And if you do it long enough,

708
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:15,140
<26-24,Taub>那感情就会变成真的了吗
<26-24,Taub>it becomes real?

709
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:16,570
<26-25,Wilson>并非如此
<26-25,Wilson>Well, no,

710
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:19,780
<26-25,Wilson>因为兴趣不是假装出来的
<26-25,Wilson>because the interest isn't fake.

711
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:21,650
<26-26,Taub>真的吗
<26-26,Taub>Really?

712
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:24,670
<26-26,Taub>因为你意识到他们并不是真笨
<26-26,Taub>Because you realize they're not dull.

713
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:26,710
<26-26,Taub>只是你误解了他们
<26-26,Taub>It was just your misinterpretation of them.

714
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:30,330
<26-27,Wilson>我只是还没找到他们的兴趣点而已
<26-27,Wilson>I just haven't found a way to make them interesting yet.

715
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,800
<26-27,Wilson>这就是个共同点的问题
<26-27,Wilson>It's all about common ground.

716
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:34,270
<26-27,Wilson>你总能找到一样你们都喜欢或讨厌的东西
<26-27,Wilson>You found one thing you both like or hate.

717
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:35,500
<26-27,Wilson>吴宇森的电影
<26-27,Wilson>John Woo movies,

718
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:37,790
<26-27,Wilson>爱情小说  万人迷
<26-27,Wilson>romance novels, kale.

719
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:43,220
<26-27,Wilson>有时候和某人建立联系的最佳方法就是
<26-27,Wilson>Sometimes, the best way to connect with someone

720
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:45,810
<26-27,Wilson>不去想他们想要什么而是关注自身
<26-27,Wilson>is stop thinking about them and focus on yourself.

721
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:50,650
<26-27,Wilson>这一切是为了什么
<26-27,Wilson>Wh--uhh. What is this about?

722
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,450
<26-28,Taub>并非事事都有是目的性的
<26-28,Taub>Not everything has an agenda.

723
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,370
<26-28,Taub>回见
<26-28,Taub>See ya.

724
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:02,130
<27-1,Anita>我告诉他因为理应如此
<27-1,Anita>I told him because it was the right thing to do.

725
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:03,240
<27-2,Foreman>没错
<27-2,Foreman>Right.

726
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:05,880
<27-3,Anita>这不会对我俩造成任何影响
<27-3,Anita>This doesn't change anything between us.

727
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:08,700
<27-4,Foreman>对我有点影响
<27-4,Foreman>It sort of does for me.

728
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,750
<27-5,Anita>你不想再见面了吗
<27-5,Anita>Y-you want to stop seeing each other?

729
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,740
<27-5,Anita>不是
<27-5,Anita>No.

730
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:17,940
<27-6,Foreman>我在想...
<27-6,Foreman>I was thinking...

731
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:21,230
<27-6,Foreman>也许你可以告诉你丈夫我们分手了
<27-6,Foreman>Maybe you could tell your husband that we did.

732
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:23,490
<27-7,Anita>然后再背着他
<27-7,Anita>And then go back to sneaking around

733
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:24,840
<27-7,Anita>和你在一起
<27-7,Anita>behind his back?

734
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,770
<27-8,Foreman>没错
<27-8,Foreman>Yes.

735
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:30,280
<27-9,Anita>你为什么想让我这么做
<27-9,Anita>Why would you want to do that?

736
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:32,720
<27-10,Foreman>我不知道  我...
<27-10,Foreman>I don't know. I...

737
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:35,590
<27-10,Foreman>现在这样我觉得...
<27-10,Foreman>This just feels...

738
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,590
<27-10,Foreman>是不对的
<27-10,Foreman>Wrong.

739
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:43,320
<27-11,Anita>我想我该走了
<27-11,Anita>I th--I think I'm gonna go.

740
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,780
<28-1,George>上帝啊
<28-1,George>Ohh, God.

741
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:05,530
<28-1,George>我们本以为是腌猪肉的问题
<28-1,George>We thought it was the salt pork.

742
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:06,990
<28-2,Sheldon>但所有人都吃了
<28-2,Sheldon>But all the menfolk been eatin' it,

743
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:09,220
<28-2,Sheldon>只有我们俩病了
<28-2,Sheldon>and we the only ones that's sick.

744
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:22,000
<28-3,House>你们俩谁是财迷
<28-3,House>Which one of you is the cheap bastard?

745
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:25,070
<28-4,George>你们的制服
<28-4,George>Your uniforms.

746
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,240
<28-3,House>不是羊毛而是涤纶的
<28-3,House>They're not wool. They're polyester.

747
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:28,640
<28-3,House>还是便宜的涤纶
<28-3,House>Cheap polyester.

748
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,320
<28-3,House>在制作过程中会粘上一种叫做
<28-3,House>Which gets processed with a heavy metal

749
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,410
<28-3,House>锑的重金属
<28-3,House>called antimony.

750
00:34:31,410 --> 00:34:33,330
<28-3,House>你们一直穿着被重金属污染了
<28-3,House>You wear badly processed polyester

751
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:35,170
<28-3,House>一整天的涤纶制服
<28-3,House>all day and night for days and nights,

752
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:36,910
<28-3,House>使得你们锑中毒
<28-3,House>you get antimony poisoning

753
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:38,600
<28-3,House>导致腹泻
<28-3,House>which caused your diarrhea

754
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:41,250
<28-3,House>和你的双手麻木
<28-3,House>and your numbness in your hands.

755
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,970
<28-3,House>还有你们俩集体呕吐
<28-3,House>And your collective vomiting.

756
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:47,630
<28-4,George>涤纶的制服
<28-4,George>Polyester uniforms?

757
00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:49,560
<28-5,Sheldon>我只是在还原历史
<28-5,Sheldon>I was being authentic.

758
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,860
<28-6,George>用涤纶的制服吗
<28-6,George>With polyester uniforms?

759
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:53,610
<28-7,Sheldon>当时政府每六个月只给士兵21美元
<28-7,Sheldon>The Confederacy gave men $21 every six months--

760
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:55,610
<28-9,Sheldon>-你害我们两个都中毒了  -至少我有原则
<28-9,Sheldon>- You poisoned us both. - At least I have principles.

761
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,160
<28-10,George>因为原则不要钱
<28-10,George>Because they don't cost anything.

762
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:58,990
<28-11,House>手足相残
<28-11,House>Brother against brother.

763
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:00,540
<28-11,House>这下真实了
<28-11,House>Now, that is authentic.

764
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,710
<29-1,Ellen>我知道你不想看到我
<29-1,Ellen>I know you don't want me here,

765
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:17,640
<29-1,Ellen>但是
<29-1,Ellen>but, um...

766
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:20,730
<29-1,Ellen>楼下餐厅有香蕉松饼
<29-1,Ellen>They had banana muffins downstairs.

767
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:26,450
<29-1,Ellen>让我想到那次我们去圣彼得斯堡旅行
<29-1,Ellen>Reminded me of our St. Pete's trip.

768
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:29,000
<29-1,Ellen>还记得吗
<29-1,Ellen>Remember?

769
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:31,410
<29-1,Ellen>那时候我们每天早上一起散步
<29-1,Ellen>We used to walk and get some

00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:33,320
<29-1,Ellen>都去蛋糕房买一些
<29-1,Ellen>every morning at that bakery.

771
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:37,730
<29-2,Callie>好像有这回事
<29-2,Callie>I guess.

772
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,110
<29-2,Callie>那次旅行中你也吸毒了吗
<29-2,Callie>Were you high on that trip?

773
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:57,930
<29-3,Ellen>和你在一起的时候没有
<29-3,Ellen>Not when we were together.

774
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:01,730
<29-3,Ellen>我都会等到你睡了以后
<29-3,Ellen>I used to wait until you went to bed.

775
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:10,230
<29-4,Callie>你可以留下
<29-4,Callie>You can stay.

776
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:13,090
<29-4,Callie>如果你愿意
<29-4,Callie>If you want.

777
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,370
<29-5,Ellen>好啊
<29-5,Ellen>Okay.

778
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,380
<29-6,Callie>好吃
<29-6,Callie>Mm. It's not bad.

779
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,180
<29-7,Ellen>她怎么了
<29-7,Ellen>What's happening?

780
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:35,390
<29-7,Ellen>是酒精治疗造成的吗
<29-7,Ellen>Is this from the alcohol treatment?

781
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:36,320
<29-8,Adams>我判断错了
<29-8,Adams>I was wrong.

782
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,690
<29-8,Adams>一定是颅内小动脉瘤破裂
<29-8,Adams>The Berry aneurysm must have just burst.

783
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,850
<30-1,Adams>颞叶没有出血

788
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:52,470
<30-4,Adams>脑室也没有
<30-4,Adams>Ventricles are clear too.

789
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:54,220
<30-5,House>动脉瘤一定是发生了渗漏  不是破裂
<30-5,House>Aneurysm must have leaked instead of burst.

790
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:55,460
<30-5,House>注射染色剂

794
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:14,500
<30-6,Adams>她没有颅内小动脉瘤
<30-6,Adams>She doesn't have a Berry aneurysm.

795
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,020
<30-7,Chase>血压正在下降  用增压仪
<30-7,Chase>Her BP's dropping. Start her on pressors.

796
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:23,860
<30-7,Chase>必须在器官衰竭前
<30-7,Chase>We gotta get her BP up

797
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:25,420
<30-7,Chase>让血压升起来
<30-7,Chase>before her organs start shutting down.

798
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:28,590
<30-8,House>亚当斯  到我这里来
<30-8,House>Adams... with me.

799
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:30,880
<31-1,Adams>增压仪最多只能为我们争取几小时时间
<31-1,Adams>Pressors will only give us a couple hours, max.

802
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,130

803
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:36,550
<31-2,Taub>我们遗漏了什么
<31-2,Taub>What are we missing?

804
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,800
<31-3,Adams>这些都是负面事件
<31-3,Adams>That's everything bad that's happened.

805
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,020
<31-3,Adams>正面的效果呢
<31-3,Adams>What about the good stuff?

<31-4,Park>你的意思是我们应该乐观起来吗
<31-4,Park>You mean like we should be more optimistic?

<31-5,Adams>使用类固醇时病情略有好转
<31-5,Adams>She got a little better when we put her on steroids,

808
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:44,560
<31-5,Adams>而类固醇能攻击肿瘤细胞
<31-5,Adams>which can attack tumor cells.

809
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:46,060
<31-5,Adams>她可能患有癌症

<31-7,Adams>She and her mom mentioned a trip they took to Florida

812
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:53,280
<31-7,Adams>去佛罗里达旅行  会不会是登革热
<31-7,Adams>a couple years ago-- what about Dengue fever?

813
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:54,180
<31-8,House>霍乱

816
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,330
<31-8,House>然后一夕之间...

<32-2,Ellen>我母亲家附近有条水渠
<32-2,Ellen>There's a canal near my mother's house.

00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,570
<32-2,Ellen>你知道她的病因了吗
<32-2,Ellen>Do you know what's wrong with her?

822
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:25,440
<32-3,House>家庭旅行害死人

<32-3,House>跟我来
<32-3,House>Come with me.

824
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:31,280
<32-3,House>不想解释两次
<32-3,House>Don't want to explain this twice.

825
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:36,970
<32-3,House>你带菌进来了  她需要心室辅助器
<32-3,House>You're letting in the flies. And she needs an LVAD.

826
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:38,760
<32-3,House>不  她不需要
<32-3,House>No, she doesn't.

827
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:41,340
<33-1,Chase>你女儿得的是蛔虫病
<33-1,Chase>Your daughter has ascariasis.

828
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:43,640
<33-2,House>是粪便中的寄生虫
<33-2,House>It's a disease caused by a parasitic worm

829
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:46,230
<33-2,House>引起的疾病
<33-2,House>found in feces.

830
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,010
<33-2,House>水渠就是动物的公厕
<33-2,House>Animals use the canal as a potty,

831
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:51,030
<33-2,House>凯莉游泳时  寄生虫虫卵
<33-2,House>the eggs from the feces ended up in Callie's intestines

832
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:52,980
<33-2,House>进入了她的肠子
<33-2,House>when she went swimming...

833
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:54,150
<33-2,House>它们在那里生长
<33-2,House>Where they hung out,

834
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:55,900
<33-2,House>悄无声息  没有引起症状
<33-2,House>quietly and asymptomatically,

835
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:58,280
<33-2,House>积蓄力量  直到有一天
<33-2,House>biding their time till, somewhere along the way,

836
00:38:58,370 --> 00:38:59,610
<33-2,House>突然被击散了
<33-2,House>they got knocked loose.

837
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:02,110
<33-2,House>可能是排球练习中的一次扑救
<33-2,House>Maybe a dive in volleyball practice

838
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,500
<33-2,House>也可能是厨房里的一次滑倒
<33-2,House>or maybe she slipped on her way into a soup kitchen.

839
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:05,910
<33-2,House>一旦散播开来
<33-2,House>But once they hatched,

840
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:07,550
<33-2,House>寄生虫开始破坏她的肺部
<33-2,House>the worms got to work on her lungs,

841
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:09,470
<33-2,House>耳和腿部神经
<33-2,House>her ear, the nerves in her legs.

842
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:11,920
<33-2,House>这些虫被我们施用的类固醇所刺激
<33-2,House>The worms got agitated by the steroids we gave her,

843
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:14,470
<33-2,House>从而向食管移动
<33-2,House>which started them on their journey to the esophagus

844
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,610
<33-2,House>并且最终到达心脏
<33-2,House>and, ultimately, to the heart.

845
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:19,890
<33-2,House>几片甲苯咪唑
<33-2,House>A few pills of Mebendazole...

846
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,940
<33-2,House>她就没事了
<33-2,House>She'll be fine.

847
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,310
<34-1,Ellen>她感觉好多了
<34-1,Ellen>She's feeling much better.

848
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,240
<34-1,Ellen>可以自己走动了
<34-1,Ellen>Walking on her own.

00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,440
<34-2,Adams>跟她母亲相处得好吗
<34-2,Adams>Getting along with her mother?

850
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,750
<34-3,Ellen>只要我继续带松饼来
<34-3,Ellen>As long as I keep bringing her muffins.

851
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:41,310
<34-4,Ellen>有人带她去做检查了吗
<34-4,Ellen>Did someone come take her for a test?

852
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,660
<34-5,Adams>凯莉的想法和你一样
<34-5,Adams>Callie agrees with you...

853
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:19,640
<34-5,Adams>人是不会变的
<34-5,Adams>That people don't change.

854
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:21,770
<34-5,Adams>她说她不愿看到
<34-5,Adams>She said when her mom slips again,

855
00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:23,000
<34-5,Adams>妈妈再度堕落
<34-5,Adams>she didn't want to be there.

856
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:25,660
<34-5,Adams>她宁愿记得妈妈现在的样子
<34-5,Adams>She'd rather remember her like she is now.

857
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:28,560
<34-6,House>聪明姑娘
<34-6,House>Smart girl.

858
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,290
<34-7,Adams>你得到了想要的结局
<34-7,Adams>You got the ending you wanted.

859
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:33,810
<34-8,House>因为我的目标只是诊病
<34-8,House>'Cause I was only looking to solve the case,

860
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,820
<34-8,House>不是挽救他们的人生
<34-8,House>not their lives.

861
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,680
<34-8,House>我不在乎为我工作的人
<34-8,House>Now, I don't care if the people who work for me

862
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:39,930
<34-8,House>是否一团糟
<34-8,House>are screwed up.

863
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:41,800
<34-8,House>实际上  我很喜欢这样
<34-8,House>In fact, I even encourage it.

864
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:44,100
<34-8,House>可是要普度众生
<34-8,House>But absolution?

865
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,020
<34-8,House>还是留到业余时间去做
<34-8,House>You do that on your own time.

866
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,160
<34-8,House>或者别做
<34-8,House>Or not at all.

867
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:52,700
<34-8,House>因为你显然也度不了谁
<34-8,House>'Cause... Clearly, you suck at it.

868
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:09,150
<34-8,House>给
<34-8,House>There.

<35-2,Taub>知道人们看见他作什么声音吗
<35-2,Taub>Do you know what sound people make about him?

881
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:21,500
<35-2,Taub>加班吗
<35-2,Taub>Working late?

882
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:24,640
<36-1,House>她今晚跟丈夫过
<36-1,House>Husband have her tonight?

883
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:27,090
<36-2,Foreman>以后也是
<36-2,Foreman>And every night.

884
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:29,430
<36-2,Foreman>她跟我分了
<36-2,Foreman>She broke it off.

885
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:31,510
<36-2,Foreman>对大家都好
<36-2,Foreman>It's for the best.

886
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:33,930
<36-2,Foreman>我毕竟不是爱偷情的人
<36-2,Foreman>I'm not really an affair guy after all.

887
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:37,020
<36-3,House>老弟  你当然是
<36-3,House>Sure you are, buddy.

888
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:39,490
<36-3,House>只不过现在不再是偷了  你没了兴致
<36-3,House>You just lost interest once it stopped being an affair.

889
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,060
<36-3,House>所以分了你反而安心
<36-3,House>That's why you're relieved.

890
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:43,410
<36-3,House>别担心  这里不是终点
<36-3,House>But don't worry-- it's not gonna end here.

<36-3,House>总有他处能让你肾上腺素得到修复
<36-3,House>You'll just have to get your adrenaline fix somewhere else.

892
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:48,080
<36-3,House>等到偷情也激不起你的肾上腺素
<36-3,House>When that doesn't do it anymore,

893
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:49,420
<36-3,House>你就会
<36-3,House>then you'll just...

894
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:50,580
<36-3,House>找到其它稀奇古怪的途径
<36-3,House>escalate things somehow.

895
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:54,870
<36-3,House>至少我听说是这样的
<36-3,House>At least, that's what I've been told.
