00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,070
<10-4,House >问题是  瑞秋比猪还笨
<10-4,House >The problem is, Rachel's dumber than a paste sandwich.

261
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:01,100
<10-5,Wilson >她进不去让你很困扰
<10-5,Wilson >And her not getting in bothers you.

00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:04,020
<10-5,Wilson >你很关心瑞秋  这不是建议
<10-5,Wilson >You care about Rachel. That was not advice.

<10-6,House >卡迪关心她

<10-6,House >要是瑞秋被拒绝入园  卡迪会伤心的
<10-6,House >When Rachel gets rejected, Cuddy will be upset.

265
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,370
<10-6,House >所以身为男友  她会希望我
<10-6,House >And as the boyfriend, I will be expected

<10-7,Wilson >这不是你的强项  我奉劝你
<10-7,Wilson >Not your strengths, I grant you.

268
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,060
<10-7,Wilson >别管这事
<10-7,Wilson >Leave it alone.

269
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,080
<10-7,Wilson >这不过是亲子活动  没事的
<10-7,Wilson >It's just a play date. It'll be fine.

270
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:19,550
<10-8,House >这种亲自活动

<10-8,House >他们会让她做智力和算术游戏
<10-8,House >They'll hand her puzzles and counting games,

273
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,730
<10-8,House >而瑞秋会坐在那吃积木
<10-8,House >and Rachel will just sit there and eat the pieces.

274
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:33,150
<10-9,Wilson >糟糕  真糟糕  我真是个白痴
<10-9,Wilson >Oh, crap! Crap! I'm such a sucker!

<10-9,Wilson >谢谢你的建议
<10-9,Wilson >Thanks for the advice.

276
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:37,100
<11-1,Masters >就是这个与世隔绝的地方

00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,170
<11-1,Masters >行为有问题的小孩被送到这里
<11-1,Masters >Kids who've behaved badly go there,

00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,810
<11-1,Masters >有时都没的休息
<11-1,Masters >sometimes 23 hours a day.

279
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,560
<11-2,Foreman >好像确实能激励良好表现
<11-2,Foreman >Sound like a pretty good incentive to behave.

280
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,230
<11-3,Masters >治标不治本
<11-3,Masters >Yeah, by treating the symptom instead of the disease.

281
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,490
<11-3,Masters >基础理论认为
<11-3,Masters >Basic systems theory.

282
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:52,250
<11-3,Masters >问题少年都是问题家庭的产物
<11-3,Masters >Troubled kids are produced by troubled families.

283
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:54,440
<11-3,Masters >这地方根本没把目标放在
<11-3,Masters >This place doesn't even attempt to change the environment

<11-4,Foreman >世上无不是的孩子  只有不是的父母咯
<11-4,Foreman >So there are no bad kids, only bad parents?

286
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:02,790
<11-4,Foreman >那为什么我弟弟成了前科犯
<11-4,Foreman >Then why is my brother an ex-con?

287
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,370
<11-5,Masters >善待孩子  但也要因材施教
<11-5,Masters >Treating kids decently doesn't mean identically.

00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:10,600
<11-5,Masters >有些孩子需要更多的纪律监督
<11-5,Masters >Some kids need more structure or discipline.

289
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:15,060
<11-5,Masters >没人需要这种地方
<11-5,Masters >Nobody needs this place.

290
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:17,800
<11-6,Foreman >或许我们找错了方向
<11-6,Foreman >Maybe we're coming at this wrong.

<11-6,Foreman >找到投毒者
<11-6,Foreman >We find a poisoner,

292
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:21,150
<11-6,Foreman >从他身上找毒素的线索
<11-6,Foreman >and let them point us toward the poison.

<11-7,Masters >德里斯科尔的队里有24个孩子
<11-7,Masters >Driscoll's got 24 kids in his troop.

00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,940
<11-7,Masters >你想跟每个孩子谈一遍吗
<11-7,Masters >You want to interview all of them?

295
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,280
<11-8,Foreman >或许不需要每个孩子都谈
<11-8,Foreman >Maybe we don't need to.

296
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,370
<12-1,Landon >德里斯科尔总关我禁闭
<12-1,Landon >Driscoll sent me to isolation all the time.

297
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,000
<12-1,Landon >但是我没有给他下毒
<12-1,Landon >It doesn't mean I poisoned him.

298
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,820
<12-1,Landon >他是疯子  我又不是
<12-1,Landon >He's the psycho, not me.

<12-2,MacDonald >D.I.德里斯科尔对他比我们其他人更为严厉
<12-2,MacDonald >D.I. Driscoll's way harder on him than the rest of us.

301
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,730
<12-3,Foreman >说不定是因为他比谁都能惹刺
<12-3,Foreman >Maybe because he's a bigger pain in the ass.

302
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:41,910
<12-3,Foreman >你是怎么进来的
<12-3,Foreman >What are you in here for?

303

306
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:47,920
<12-5,Foreman >如果他死于你投的毒
<12-5,Foreman >If he dies because of whatever you gave him,

307
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,840
<12-5,Foreman >这就是你的下场
<12-5,Foreman >that's what'll happen.

308
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,510
<12-6,Landon >那有什么可怕
<12-6,Landon >That supposed to scare me?

309
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,580
<12-6,Landon >我妈死了  我从小没见过我爸
<12-6,Landon >My mom's dead, my dad's never been around.

310
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:55,540
<12-6,Landon >从这儿出去  我会被转到另一个寄养家庭
<12-6,Landon >And after this, I'll get bounced to another foster home.

311
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:57,500
<12-6,Landon >反正也是前途无亮
<12-6,Landon >My future's not exactly bright.

<12-6,Landon >坐牢不过是早晚的事
<12-6,Landon >Prison now or later

00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:00,060
<12-6,Landon >我也不在乎
<12-6,Landon >doesn't make that much of a difference to me.

314

<12-7,MacDonald >我说  你还拖不拖地板了
<12-7,MacDonald >Dude, I'm not mopping the whole floor by myself.

<12-7,MacDonald >Your eyes are red.

00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:43,310
<16-2,House >还有没有其他人参与组织招生会
<16-2,House >or does someone else oversee these sessions?

376

384
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,950
<16-5,Teacher >为安全起见  我们或许该把这些玩具处理掉
<16-5,Teacher >Maybe, to be safe, we get rid of these toys.

<17-2,Foreman >你就坐在这里  看着监视器
<17-2,Foreman >You're literally gonna sit here, watch the monitor,

392
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,580
<17-2,Foreman >如果他感觉孤单了就陪他说句话
<17-2,Foreman >And chat with him if he gets lonely.

00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:34,740
<17-3,Masters >可是

<17-6,Driscoll >你用不着在我面前保护兰德勒
<17-6,Driscoll >You shouldn't bother trying to protect Landon.

397
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:00,700
<17-6,Driscoll >我知道是他给我下的毒
<17-6,Driscoll >I know he's the one who drugged me.

398
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,620
<17-7,Masters >抗组胺药不是你的病因
<17-7,Masters >The antihistamines aren't what got you sick.

399
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,250
<17-8,Driscoll >那也改变不了他投毒的事实
<17-8,Driscoll >Doesn't change the fact that he did it.

400
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:10,490
<17-8,Driscoll >在他身上我什么方法都试过了  可还是
<17-8,Driscoll >I tried everything with that kid. I just...

401
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,940
<17-8,Driscoll >没什么进展
<17-8,Driscoll >can't break through.

<17-9,Masters >你很关心他
<17-9,Masters >It's clear you care about him.

00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:16,890
<17-9,Masters >你有没有试着告诉他这点
<17-9,Masters >Have you tried telling him that?

404
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:17,990
<17-10,Driscoll >有些事你得明白
<17-10,Driscoll >You gotta understand something.

405
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:20,620
<17-10,Driscoll >这些孩子  都是见人下菜碟的好手
<17-10,Driscoll >These kids, they're all manipulators.

406
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:21,910
<17-10,Driscoll >我虽然关心他们
<17-10,Driscoll >As much as I care about all of them,

<17-10,Driscoll >我不能  我不能表露出来

408
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:26,300
<17-10,Driscoll >除非我们能互相尊重
<17-10,Driscoll >unless there's some mutual respect.

409
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:28,070
<17-11,Masters >-否则  -先不论其他的孩子
<17-11,Masters >- otherwise-- - Forget those other kids.

410
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,170
<17-11,Masters >就说说这个
<17-11,Masters >Think about this kid.

411
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:34,960
<17-11,Masters >他亲眼目睹自己的母亲得病死去
<17-11,Masters >He watched his mother get sick and die.

412
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,260
<17-11,Masters >又从没见过自己的父亲
<17-11,Masters >He's never known his dad.

413
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,420
<17-11,Masters >谁知道他有多久
<17-11,Masters >Who knows how long it's been

414
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,830
<17-11,Masters >没被人真正关心过了
<17-11,Masters >since anyone's taken care of him,

415
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,370
<17-11,Masters >或者是否有人曾在他身边
<17-11,Masters >or if there's ever been a man around

416
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:44,680
<17-11,Masters >稍稍待过一段时间
<17-11,Masters >with any degree of consistency?

417
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:50,210
<17-11,Masters >我相信你是为他好
<17-11,Masters >I believe that you're on his side.

418
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:54,050
<17-11,Masters >我敢打赌如果让他知道  效果会更好
<17-11,Masters >I'm betting it would help if he did.

419
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:03,180
<18-1,Taub >你真是个美男子  我可以走了吗
<18-1,Taub >You are a beautiful man. Can I leave now?

420
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:05,210
<18-2,Chase >我知道这三个女人都在哪儿了
<18-2,Chase >I know where all three women are,

421
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:07,220
<18-2,Chase >但我不想怪错人
<18-2,Chase >but I'd like to avoid the additional humiliation

422
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:09,160
<18-2,Chase >以免不必要地丢人现眼
<18-2,Chase >of falsely accusing any of them.

423
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:11,050
<18-2,Chase >你从这张照片上看出了是哪家旅馆
<18-2,Chase >You I.D. the hotel off this.

424
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:15,330
<18-2,Chase >但愿你还能找到一些别的线索
<18-2,Chase >I'm hoping there's another clue in there somewhere.

425
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,380
<18-3,Taub >我们可以提高画质
<18-3,Taub >We could enhance the image.

426
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,200
<18-3,Taub >也许她的脸蛋
<18-3,Taub >Maybe her face

427
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,270
<18-3,Taub >能从你光洁可鉴的屁股上映出来
<18-3,Taub >is reflected in that gleam off your butt cheek.

428
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,780
<18-3,Taub >或者也许是时候该让你记住
<18-3,Taub >Or maybe it's time to chalk this up

429
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:28,200
<18-3,Taub >当一名花花公子的教训了
<18-3,Taub >to the hazards of being a player.

<18-4,Chase >你还不是因为采花成性搅黄了婚姻
<18-4,Chase >Your zipper problems just blew up your marriage.

431
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:35,330
<18-5,Taub >别动
<18-5,Taub >Don't move.

432
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,580
<18-5,Taub >不像我  你至少没背叛过别人
<18-5,Taub >Unlike me, you've had the decency not to cheat on anyone,

433
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,930
<18-5,Taub >但你根本不在意
<18-5,Taub >but you haven't been giving much thought

434
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,580
<18-5,Taub >这些女人是谁  也没顾及人家的感受
<18-5,Taub >to who these women are, how they might feel.

435
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,540
<18-5,Taub >显而易见  你伤了其中一个的心
<18-5,Taub >Obviously, you hurt one of them.

436
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,570
<18-5,Taub >感情上  你伤了她
<18-5,Taub >Emotionally, you hurt her,

437
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:49,820
<18-5,Taub >肉体上  你怎么会知道呢
<18-5,Taub >because physically, how would you even know?

<18-6,Taub >看来你那根小牙签还真挺纤细的
<18-6,Taub >Looks like your shorty is a shorty.

<28-4,Mackenzie >Because I thought we totally had a connection.

605
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:10,030
<28-4,Mackenzie >而你却没有问我要电话  我
<28-4,Mackenzie >And then when you didn't ask me for my number, I

<28-6,Mackenzie >Yeah, but you were obviously more into me

608
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,600
<28-6,Mackenzie >你明显跟我更亲密啊
<28-6,Mackenzie >than you were into Nika

<28-9,Mackenzie >只是毕业前
<28-9,Mackenzie >Just until graduation.

615
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:30,090
<28-9,Mackenzie >大学毕业
<28-9,Mackenzie >College?

616
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,450
<28-9,Mackenzie >你多大了

<28-11,Chase >听着  我希望到此为止
<28-11,Chase >Look, I just need this to stop.

<28-12,Mackenzie >我爸妈甚至都不让我上社交网站
<28-12,Mackenzie >My parents won't even let me on social networking sites.

623
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:48,260
<28-12,Mackenzie >坏人太多了
<28-12,Mackenzie >Too many sexual predators.

624
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,820
<29-1,Driscoll >拦住他
<29-1,Driscoll >Stop him.

625
00:27:57,930 --> 00:28:00,830
<29-2,Foreman >你要去哪里
<29-2,Foreman >Hey, hey. Where you going?

00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:02,340
<29-2,Foreman >你在生病
<29-2,Foreman >Hey, you're sick.

00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,310
<29-2,Foreman >要呆在医院里
<29-2,Foreman >You need to be in the hospital.

<29-3,Landon >而且不会送我会营地
<29-3,Landon >Ones that won't send me back to that camp!

630
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:07,130
<29-4,Masters >兰德勒  怎么回事
<29-4,Masters >Landon, what's going on?

631
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:09,900
<29-5,Landon >求你了  别送我回营地
<29-5,Landon >Please, help me. Don't send me back.

632
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:12,330
<29-5,Landon >这是我的车钥匙  你从我口袋里偷的吗
<29-5,Landon >Those are my car keys. You stole them out of my pocket?

633
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:14,710
<29-6,Foreman >没有不是的孩子对吧
<29-6,Foreman >No bad kids, huh?

634
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,920
<29-7,Driscoll >你们拦住兰德勒了吗
<29-7,Driscoll >Did you stop Landon?

635
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,390
<29-8,Foreman >是的  你怎么样
<29-8,Foreman >Yeah, yeah. What's wrong?

636
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:22,530
<29-9,Driscoll >我的腿  好疼  好像肌肉夹在虎钳里
<29-9,Driscoll >Oh, my legs, they hurt. The muscles are in a vise.

637
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,780
<29-10,Masters >什么意思
<29-10,Masters >What does it mean?

638
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:24,560
<29-11,Foreman >还不确定
<29-11,Foreman >I'm not sure yet.

639
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:27,250
<29-11,Foreman >10毫克安定  钾40
<29-11,Foreman >Ten diazepam. 40 potassium.

640
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,640
<30-1,Foreman >肾功能障碍
<30-1,Foreman >The leg pain was caused

641
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,550
<30-1,Foreman >造成的低钠血症
<30-1,Foreman >by a muscle cramp from low sodium,

642
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,100
<30-1,Foreman >引起肌肉筋挛进而导致腿痛
<30-1,Foreman >which was caused by kidney dysfunction.

643
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:39,780
<30-2,Masters >兰德勒对强力霉素也没有反应
<30-2,Masters >Landon didn't respond to doxycycline either.

644
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,470
<30-2,Masters >所以可以排除莱姆病了
<30-2,Masters >I think we can rule out lyme.

645
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:42,790
<30-2,Masters >我以为我已经和他沟通好了
<30-2,Masters >I thought I was getting through to him,

646
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:44,550
<30-2,Masters >原来他只是想偷我的钥匙
<30-2,Masters >and he just wanted to steal my car keys.

647
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,070
<30-3,House >如果只是他先前的行为
<30-3,House >If only his previous behavior

648
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,210
<30-3,House >就给你借口让你这么想
<30-3,House >had given you a reason to expect that.

649
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:51,520
<30-4,Taub >你为什么要把辣酱涂在玩具上
<30-4,Taub >Why are you putting hot sauce on a toy?

650
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:53,050
<30-5,House >可能你不关心小孩
<30-5,House >Maybe you don't care if children chew

651
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:55,700
<30-5,House >咬你的毛毛虫  我觉得是错的
<30-5,House >on your caterpillar. I think it's wrong.

652
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,640
<30-5,House >除此之外又是什么导致肾功能障碍的呢
<30-5,House >What causes kidney dysfunction on top of everything else?

653
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,230
<30-6,Masters >砷中毒
<30-6,Masters >Arsenic poisoning.

654
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:03,140
<30-6,Masters >人是会变的
<30-6,Masters >And people do change.

655
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,090
<30-6,Masters >当我问兰德勒的过去时
<30-6,Masters >Driscoll took it to heart

656
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:08,090
<30-6,Masters >德里斯科尔很用心
<30-6,Masters >when I asked him to think about Landon's history.

657
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:09,540
<30-6,Masters >他变得很好  然后
<30-6,Masters >He was much nicer, and then

658
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:12,440
<30-7,House >这两个说不通
<30-7,House >Wow, two ideas that don't make any sense.

659
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:15,410
<30-7,House >如果是砷  他们应该上吐下泻
<30-7,House >If it was arsenic, they'd be puking and pooping.

660
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:17,800
<30-7,House >向陌生人说教
<30-7,House >And conversations with moralizing strangers

661
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:21,920
<30-7,House >不会改变他们的行为
<30-7,House >do not make people change their behavior.

662
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:29,660
<30-8,House >瑞秋肯定不会一而再的干这事了
<30-8,House >Rachel is not gonna do that more than once.

663
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:33,710
<30-9,Chase >低血糖会引发脑部  肾脏以及心脏问题
<30-9,Chase >Whipple's could affect the brain, kidneys, heart.

664
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,290
<30-10,Masters >但不会导致肠胃问题
<30-10,Masters >Not without G.I. involvement.

665
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,990
<30-10,Masters >你为何就不相信呢
<30-10,Masters >Why is it impossible to believe

666
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,240
<30-10,Masters >我的劝说很有说服力  他也...
<30-10,Masters >I made a compelling argument, and he--

667
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,190
<30-11,House >即便他改变了  也不会是因为你
<30-11,House >If he changed, it's because something besides you

668
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,080
<30-11,House >而是其他事情让他信服
<30-11,House >made that argument compelling.

<30-12,Taub >points to botulism toxin, which lives in soil.

671
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,930
<30-12,Taub >由男孩额头上的伤口
<30-12,Taub >Got into the kid's bloodstream

672
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,240
<30-12,Taub >进入其血管内
<30-12,Taub >through the cut on his forehead.

673
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:53,510
<30-12,Taub >由教官脚上的擦伤伤口
<30-12,Taub >Got into the drill instructor's

674
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:56,250
<30-12,Taub >也进入了他的血液里
<30-12,Taub >through some abrasions on his feet.

675
00:29:57,910 --> 00:29:59,530
<30-13,House >有道理
<30-13,House >Good idea.

676

<30-13,House >给他俩都用上解毒剂
<30-13,House >Give 'em both the antitoxin.

<31-1,Landon >我瞧见了逃离这里的机会
<31-1,Landon >I saw my chance to get out of here.

678
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:10,860
<31-1,Landon >我得把握住机会
<31-1,Landon >I had to take it.

679
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:12,230
<31-2,Masters >不要找借口
<31-2,Masters >Don't make excuses.

680
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,750
<31-2,Masters >你偷了我的车钥匙
<31-2,Masters >You tried to steal from me.

681
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:15,230
<31-3,Driscoll >我告诉过你这帮孩子就这样
<31-3,Driscoll >All these kids are manipulators.

<31-3,Driscoll >绝对不能掉以轻心
<31-3,Driscoll >You can't let your guard down.

683

<31-4,Landon >你说"这帮孩子"是什么意思
<31-4,Landon >What do you mean "All these kids"?

684
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,070
<31-4,Landon >别把我和训练营里的那帮烂人混为一谈
<31-4,Landon >Don't lump me in with the losers at that camp.

685
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:21,830
<31-5,Masters >我看你和那里挺配的
<31-5,Masters >Seems like you belong there.

686
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:23,210
<31-5,Masters >这说不定是你唯一的出路
<31-5,Masters >It may be your only chance.

687
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:24,660
<31-6,Landon >听着  我是犯过错
<31-6,Landon >Look, I've screwed up,

688
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,210
<31-6,Landon >但我还没犯过法
<31-6,Landon >but I've never been in trouble with the law.

689
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,300
<31-6,Landon >你说你是因商店行窃而入训练营的
<31-6,Landon >You said you were in for shoplifting.

00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:34,650
<31-7,Landon >报告给了管理我的社工
<31-7,Landon >Called my DCS caseworker.

694
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:36,930
<31-8,Masters >我还以为营员都是因法院判决而入营的
<31-8,Masters >I thought all the kids were there under court order.

695
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,450
<31-9,Driscoll >一般而言是这样的
<31-9,Driscoll >That's usually how it works.

696
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:42,410
<31-10,Masters >为何他不一样呢
<31-10,Masters >So why is he different?

697
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:49,220
<31-11,Nika >我为何要照一张你的裸照呢
<31-11,Nika >Why would I take a naked picture of you?

698
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,250
<31-11,Nika >你是很有魅力  不过还没那么大魅力
<31-11,Nika >You're cute, but you're not that cute.

699
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,130
<31-11,Nika >现在请你离开
<31-11,Nika >Now please go.

<32-1,Chase >你是剩下唯一的嫌疑人了  我把你惹毛了
<32-1,Chase >You're the only one left. You're pissed off.

<32-2,Nika >我是很生气  因为你正在我的公寓里
<32-2,Nika >I'm pissed off because you're in my apartment,

702
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:58,860
<32-2,Nika >而我的男友很可能马上就过来了
<32-2,Nika >and my boyfriend might be here any minute.

703
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,490
<32-3,Chase >男友
<32-3,Chase >Boyfriend.

704
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:01,940
<32-4,Nika >我最不想做的事就是让他发现我出轨
<32-4,Nika >Last thing I want to do is publicize that I cheated on him

705
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:03,840
<32-4,Nika >所以我为何要让你出丑
<32-4,Nika >so why would I prank you?

706
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:06,620
<32-5,Chase >可婚礼那天你男友哪去了
<32-5,Chase >And where was this boyfriend at the wedding?

707
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:10,310
<32-6,Nika >-出城了  -真是便宜男友
<32-6,Nika >- Out of town. - Conveniently.

708

<32-7,Nika >这是上个月我姐姐生日会上的照片
<32-7,Nika >It's from my sister's birthday last month.

709
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:16,290
<32-7,Nika >在你狡辩他是我哥哥之前
<32-7,Nika >And before you suggest he's my brother,

710
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:18,280
<32-7,Nika >仔细看看  我和他是在热吻
<32-7,Nika >note how I'm kissing him.

711
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:21,080
<32-7,Nika >我们互惠互利  那是个错误
<32-7,Nika >You used me, I used you. It was a mistake.

712
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:23,530
<32-7,Nika >而我现在只想忘记过去
<32-7,Nika >Now I just want to forget about it.

713

<33-1,Masters >我刚刚和兰德勒的社工通了电话
<33-1,Masters >I just got off the phone with Landon's DCS caseworker.

714
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,490
<33-1,Masters >你说的对
<33-1,Masters >You were right.

715
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:36,730
<33-1,Masters >我的劝说本身并没让他信服
<33-1,Masters >I'm not what made my argument compelling.

716
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,420
<33-1,Masters >这是要去哪里
<33-1,Masters >Where are we going?

717
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:49,380
<34-1,Landon >给你的膀胱做次杀菌浴
<34-1,Landon >To give your bladder an antibiotic wash

718
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:51,980
<34-2,Masters >防止感染
<34-2,Masters >to protect against infection.

719
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:02,550
<34-3,Driscoll >你是谁
<34-3,Driscoll >Who are you?

720
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,980
<34-4,House >我是豪斯医生
<34-4,House >I'm Dr. House.

721
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:09,640
<34-4,House >那男孩和他妈妈简直是一个模子印出来的
<34-4,House >And that boy is the spitting image of his mother.

722
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,440
<34-4,House >当然  我从来没见过她本人
<34-4,House >Of course, I've never seen her,

723
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,530
<34-4,House >但分管他的社工告诉我的手下
<34-4,House >but his care worker told my lackey

724
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,670
<34-4,House >说是你替他付了参加训练营的费用
<34-4,House >that you paid his enrolment fee at the camp.

725
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,720
<34-4,House >这意味着你可能是他家人的朋友
<34-4,House >That could mean that you're a family friend,

726
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,640
<34-4,House >但若是这样  你何必匿名呢
<34-4,House >but then, why hide it?

727
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:27,120
<34-4,House >而唯一一个想要隐瞒的人...
<34-4,House >The only person who'd want to hide it...

728
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,490
<34-4,House >就是他不负责任的父亲
<34-4,House >is his deadbeat dad,

729
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:32,820
<34-4,House >而这个父亲决定要承担起父亲的职责
<34-4,House >who has decided not to be a deadbeat anymore.

730
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,380
<34-5,Driscoll >求求你  不要告诉他
<34-5,Driscoll >Please, don't tell him.

731
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:47,310
<35-1,House >我们费了好几天  找他俩之间的关系
<35-1,House >We spend days looking for a link between them,

732
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:49,790
<35-1,House >而他却不告诉我们这孩子是他的儿子
<35-1,House >and he doesn't tell us the kid is his son.

733
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:51,870
<35-2,Masters >我们一直在找共同的暴露源
<35-2,Masters >We were looking for exposures.

734
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:53,550
<35-2,Masters >他觉得这事和治疗没有关系
<35-2,Masters >He didn't think it was medically relevant.

735
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,490
<35-3,Taub >不久后  他也不用担心儿子发现真相了
<35-3,Taub >Soon, he won't have to worry about his kidding finding out.

736
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:58,410
<35-3,Taub >死了后  秘密就永远是秘密了
<35-3,Taub >Being dead makes keeping secrets much easier.

737
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:00,770
<35-3,Taub >肉毒素治疗对他们都不起作用
<35-3,Taub >Neither one was responding to botulism treatment,

738
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:02,250
<35-3,Taub >男孩已经开始出现痉挛了
<35-3,Taub >And the boy started having seizures.

739
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,470
<35-4,Foreman >德里斯科尔也许是对的
<35-4,Foreman >And Driscoll might have been right

740
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,500
<35-4,Foreman >他们的父子关系是无关的
<35-4,Foreman >that their biological relationship doesn't matter.

741
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,570
<35-4,Foreman >遗传性疾病会在同一年龄段暴发
<35-4,Foreman >Genetic illness emerges when people are the same age,

742
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:09,000
<35-4,Foreman >但不会在同一周
<35-4,Foreman >not during the same week.

743
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:10,340
<35-5,Chase >除非是由某种东西触发的
<35-5,Chase >Unless there's a trigger.

744
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,470
<35-5,Chase >环境因素可能
<35-5,Chase >Genetic conditions can be set off

745
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:12,720
<35-5,Chase >会抵消遗传因素
<35-5,Chase >by things in the surroundings,

746
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:15,170
<35-5,Chase >而明显地  这两人生活环境相同
<35-5,Chase >and these two obviously share surroundings.

747
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:16,810
<35-6,Masters >这种现象很罕见
<35-6,Masters >That's a relatively rare phenomenon.

748
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,710
<35-6,Masters >不过这正是我们的专长
<35-6,Masters >Which is our specialty, I know.

749
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:23,670
<35-7,Chase >我们的病人是亲属  不可能是巧合
<35-7,Chase >Our patients are related. That can't be a coincidence.

750
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,060
<35-7,Chase >我刚才灵光一闪
<35-7,Chase >I just had an idea.

751
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:31,340
<35-8,House >和我们的病例有关系吗
<35-8,House >Relevant to our case?

752
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,610
<35-9,Chase >没有
<35-9,Chase >No.

753
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:34,460
<35-10,House >老实坐下
<35-10,House >Sit.

754
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:37,800
<35-11,House >暴露于重金属可能会引起韦格纳肉芽肿
<35-11,House >Wegener's can be brought on by exposure to heavy metals.

755
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:38,900
<35-11,House >你们在营地发现什么没
<35-11,House >Did you see anything at the camp?

756
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:39,800
<35-12,Masters >在隔离房附近
<35-12,Masters >Near the isolation hut,

757
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,300
<35-12,Masters >有废旧的发电机电池
<35-12,Masters >there were some old generator batteries.

758
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:43,740
<35-12,Masters >会不会泄漏到了土壤中
<35-12,Masters >Could have leaked into the soil?

759
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:44,830
<35-13,Taub >但那样营地里的其他人
<35-13,Taub >Seems like someone else in the camp

760
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:47,010
<35-13,Taub >也会铅中毒
<35-13,Taub >would have had lead poisoning.

761
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:50,900
<35-14,House >你有更好的解释吗
<35-14,House >You got anything better?

762
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,290
<35-14,House >用环磷酰胺治疗
<35-14,House >Treat with cyclophosphamide.

763
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:56,090
<35-14,House >你去找你的灵光吧
<35-14,House >Go find your bliss.

764
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,760
<35-14,House >现在我要先离开了  我还有个约会
<35-14,House >Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a play date.

765
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:14,410
<35-14,House >他妈妈去世时  你为何没站出来
<35-14,House >Why didn't you step forward when his mom died?

766
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:18,540
<36-1,Driscoll >我在她去世几个月后才知道
<36-1,Driscoll >I found out she'd passed months later.

767
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:22,310
<36-1,Driscoll >而那时  兰德勒已经被纳入领养系统了
<36-1,Driscoll >By then, Landon was already in the foster system.

768
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:26,540
<36-1,Driscoll >他出岔子时
<36-1,Driscoll >I was figuring out a way to approach him

769
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:28,590
<36-1,Driscoll >我正在想怎样才能进入他的生活
<36-1,Driscoll >when he got into trouble,

770
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:32,400
<36-1,Driscoll >所以我就把他带入训练营
<36-1,Driscoll >so I brought him to the camp.

771
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:34,300
<36-2,Masters >你要告诉他真相
<36-2,Masters >You need to tell him.

772
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:38,300
<36-3,Driscoll >我做不到  至少现在不行
<36-3,Driscoll >I can't. Not now.

773
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:40,140
<36-3,Driscoll >如果我死了  我留给他的唯一印象
<36-3,Driscoll >If I die, the only thing I'll ever be to him

774
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:42,750
<36-3,Driscoll >就是那个强迫他训练的混蛋教练
<36-3,Driscoll >is the hardass who made him run obstacle courses.

775
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,130
<36-4,Masters >你为了自己精神不受控状态下的行为
<36-4,Masters >You'll apologize to me for something done

776
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:48,230
<36-4,Masters >都会向我道歉
<36-4,Masters >in a psychotic state,

777
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:51,120
<36-4,Masters >怎么就不敢站出来  做个像样的父亲呢
<36-4,Masters >but you won't own up to being his father.

778
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:51,650
<36-4,Masters >不是说
<36-4,Masters >What happened to

779
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:54,670
<36-4,Masters >"男子汉要勇于承担责任"吗
<36-4,Masters >"Actions have consequences, a man accepts them"?

780
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:56,260
<36-5,Driscoll >我已经在他的生命中了
<36-5,Driscoll >I'm in his life,

781
00:34:56,310 --> 00:35:00,450
<36-5,Driscoll >也正努力让他走上正途
<36-5,Driscoll >and I am working to get him on the right path.

782
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:03,050
<36-6,Masters >他需要的并不是位教官
<36-6,Masters >He doesn't need a drill instructor.

783
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:08,910
<36-6,Masters >而是位父亲
<36-6,Masters >He needs a dad.

784
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:16,310
<37-1,Cuddy >你能来真的很贴心
<37-1,Cuddy >It's so sweet of you coming to this.

785
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,630
<37-2,House >这不是为了支持你嘛
<37-2,House >Just trying to be supportive.

786
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:21,910
<37-2,House >听说这是男朋友的职责
<37-2,House >I've heard that's what boyfriends do.

787
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:26,770
<37-3,Cuddy >嗨  宝贝  玩的开心吗
<37-3,Cuddy >Hi, honey. Hi. Did you have fun?

788
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:34,200
<37-4,Teacher >瑞秋玩的很开心  什么都会玩
<37-4,Teacher >Rachel had a great time. Played with everything.

789
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:36,950
<37-4,Teacher >真是个聪明的小姑娘
<37-4,Teacher >She's a very clever girl.

790
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,170
<37-4,Teacher >我抱歉要问些问题  有些家长
<37-4,Teacher >I'm sorry to ask this, but we've had some problems

791
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,060
<37-4,Teacher >会提前教孩子玩玩具
<37-4,Teacher >with parents coaching kids.

792
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:47,330
<37-4,Teacher >瑞秋异常快地学会了我们的玩具
<37-4,Teacher >Rachel caught onto our toys unusually quickly,

793
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:49,330
<37-4,Teacher >她甚至知道游戏叫做
<37-4,Teacher >And she even knew the game was called

794
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:51,690
<37-4,Teacher >"喂猴子"
<37-4,Teacher >"Feed the monkey."

795
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,200
<37-4,Teacher >虽然我很想让孩子来这儿上学
<37-4,Teacher >Uh, well, as eager as I am to have her go here,

796
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:58,390
<37-4,Teacher >我保证我绝对不会这么做
<37-4,Teacher >I promise you I would never do that.

797
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,050
<37-5,Rachel >瑞秋
<37-5,Rachel >Hey, Rachel.

798
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:04,500
<37-5,Rachel >你以前玩过"喂猴子"这个游戏吗
<37-5,Rachel >Have you ever played "Feed the monkey" before?

799
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:10,830
<37-5,Rachel >没有  妈妈
<37-5,Rachel >No, mama.

800
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,950
<37-5,Rachel >她看起来那么傻
<37-5,Rachel >She seemed so dumb.

801
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:17,550
<37-5,Rachel >但有压力时
<37-5,Rachel >But when the pressure was on,

802
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,950
<37-5,Rachel >她很清楚地知道该怎么做
<37-5,Rachel >she knew what had to be done,

803
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:21,930
<37-5,Rachel >做得还挺好
<37-5,Rachel >and she did it.

804
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:24,070
<38-1,Man >你这么焦虑是因为你家孩子撒谎了吗
<38-1,Man >You're pumped 'cause your kid lied?

805
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:28,270
<38-2,House >不是我家孩子  她就是个小混蛋
<38-2,House >She's not my kid. She's a pain in the ass.

806
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:31,960
<38-2,House >而且她撒的谎可比你好多了
<38-2,House >And she's a better liar than you are.

807
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:35,010
<38-2,House >你不是上货车时划伤了腿
<38-2,House >You didn't cut your leg getting into your truck.

808
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:38,400
<38-2,House >伤口处有泥土和沙砾
<38-2,House >The abrasion has dirt and gravel in it.

809
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:40,610
<38-2,House >还有点肥料
<38-2,House >A bit of fertilizer too.

810
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:42,370
<38-3,Man >摔在我的温室里了
<38-3,Man >Tripped in my greenhouse.

811
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,200
<38-3,Man >我在种自己的有机植物
<38-3,Man >Growing my own organic veggies.

812
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:47,390
<38-4,House >别打听了  保密
<38-4,House >Didn't ask. Not gonna tell.

813
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:50,900
<38-4,House >她没犹豫迟疑  也没虚张声势
<38-4,House >She didn't hesitate. She didn't oversell.

814
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:53,960
<38-4,House >学会这样撒谎我用了很多年
<38-4,House >Took me years to learn how to lie like that.

815
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:55,450
<38-4,House >瑞秋却天生就会
<38-4,House >And Rachel has it on instinct.

816
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:58,160
<38-5,Man >听起来你蛮喜欢那孩子嘛
<38-5,Man >Sounds like you're real fond of that kid.

817
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:01,010
<38-6,House >你还真是"明察秋毫"
<38-6,House >You're really not good with nuance, are you?

818
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:03,950
<38-6,House >我欣赏的是她的天赋
<38-6,House >I admire her talent.

819
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:07,380
<38-6,House >让我先给你麻醉
<38-6,House >I'm just gonna numb you up...

820
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,930
<38-6,House >我得撤了
<38-6,House >I gotta go.

821
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:22,330
<39-1,Masters >最新的肾功能测试表明目前还没有改观
<39-1,Masters >Latest kidney function test shows no improvement.

822
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,130
<39-2,House >缝针很赞  疼吗
<39-2,House >Nice stitches. Do they hurt?

823
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,420
<39-3,Landon >不  他们给我打了点什么东西
<39-3,Landon >No. They gave me a shot of something.

824
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,980
<39-4,House >那叫做利多卡因[一种局部麻醉剂]
<39-4,House >That was lidocaine.

825
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:30,810
<39-4,House >它触发了一种遗传病
<39-4,House >It triggered an underlying genetic condition

826
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:34,080
<39-4,House >多样性卟啉病
<39-4,House >Called variegate porphyria.

827
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:36,100
<39-5,Masters >这可以解释他俩的病症
<39-5,Masters >That would explain their symptoms.

828
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:37,650
<39-6,Driscoll >我没打过利多卡因啊
<39-6,Driscoll >But I didn't have any lidocaine.

829
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,280
<39-7,House >托这个小魔王的福
<39-7,House >But you had a handful of antihistamines,

830
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,450
<39-7,House >你吃了不少抗组胺药
<39-7,House >courtesy of the deviant in the next bed.

831
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:44,220
<39-7,House >这也能触发卟啉病
<39-7,House >It's also a porphyria trigger.

832
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:48,170
<39-8,Landon >我们得了相同的遗传病吗
<39-8,Landon >Wait, so we have the same genetic thing?

833
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:49,640
<39-8,Landon >对
