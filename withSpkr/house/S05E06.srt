<2-10,House>这说明你觉得不需要自我辩护
<2-10,House>It means you don't feelabcthe need to defend yourself,

45
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,730
<2-10,House>也就是说你不为收养孩子担心

46
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,290
<2-10,House>也就是说你已经有一个孩子了

<2-11,Cuddy>我们11点见面

<2-17,Cuddy>that she may have passed on to a kid?

58
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:30,680
<2-18,House>因为你是个控制欲强的自恋狂
<2-18,House>Because you're a controlabcseeking narcissist.

59
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:32,650

00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:07,060
<4-13,Taub>也没有风景 楼空了一半
<4-13,Taub>And no view. Building's half-empty.

120
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:09,140
<4-13,Taub>他宁愿窗外是收费站也不选公园
<4-13,Taub>He'd rather have a view ofabcthe turn pike than the park.

121
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,750
<4-14,Thirteen>窗外是公园可能要贵一半
<4-14,Thirteen>Park views are probably 50% more.

122
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,370
<4-14,Thirteen>看了这个地方后abc你还不信他是个实用主义者?
<4-14,Thirteen>You're the surprised the guy's aabcpragmatist after looking at this place?

123
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:16,150
<4-15,Taub>他不是实用主义者 他是苦修者
<4-15,Taub>Guy's not a pragmatist.abcHe's a flagellant.

124
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:19,020
<4-16,Thirteen>看上去像霉菌
<4-16,Thirteen>Looks like mold.

125
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:33,610
<4-17,Taub>要是妈妈打扫的 就干净多了
<4-17,Taub>Mom would've cleaned better.

126
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,320
<5-1,Thirteen>暴露在某些霉菌中可导致短期记忆丧失
<5-1,Thirteen>exposure to certain types of moldabccan cause short term memory loss.

127
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:39,850
<5-1,Thirteen>你们俩都要做测试
<5-1,Thirteen>We're testing both of you.

128
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,510
<5-2,Samantha>我感觉挺好的
<5-2,Samantha>I feel fine.

129
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,160
<5-3,Thirteen>也许 但我们要谨慎
<5-3,Thirteen>I'm sure you are. We'reabcjust being cautious.

130
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:48,010
<5-3,Thirteen>除了学校和家 你们还去哪儿?
<5-3,Thirteen>So where do you guysabcgo other than home and school?

131
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:50,540
<5-4,Samantha>哪儿也不去 爸爸在家工作 我去学校上学
<5-4,Samantha>Nowhere. Dad works atabchome,and I go to school.

132
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:53,390
<5-5,Thirteen>有没有运动 朋友 旅行?
<5-5,Thirteen>What about sports,friends, travel?

133
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:57,230
<5-6,Samantha>就像我说的 爸爸在家工作 我去学校上学
<5-6,Samantha>Like I said, dad works atabchome,and I go to school.

134
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:01,790
<5-7,Thirteen>妈妈不在身边一定很难吧?
<5-7,Thirteen>Must be hard notabchaving your mom around, huh?

135
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,100
<5-8,Samantha>事故发生时 我只有四岁
<5-8,Samantha>I was only four whenabcthe accident happened.

136
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:08,070
<5-9,Thirteen>我知道你们肯定常常想念她的
<5-9,Thirteen>Still, I'm sure youabcboth miss her sometimes.

137
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:10,980
<5-10,Samantha>也不是
<5-10,Samantha>Not really.

138
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,250
<5-11,Thirteen>你太坚强了
<5-11,Thirteen>You're strong.

139
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:18,140
<5-12,Samantha>我只是觉得死没什么大不了的
<5-12,Samantha>No, I just don't get what the bigabcdeal about death is, you know?

140
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:21,830
<5-13,Thirteen>哦
<5-13,Thirteen>Yeah.

141
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,400
<6-1,Foreman>她怎么样?
<6-1,Foreman>How is she?

142
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:28,430
<6-2,Thirteen>身体很健康
<6-2,Thirteen>Physically, she's fine.

143
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,170
<6-2,Thirteen>但神经兮兮的
<6-2,Thirteen>Mentally, she's weird.

144
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:33,040
<6-3,Foreman>她被她爸爸吓坏了
<6-3,Foreman>I'm sure she's just freakedabcout about her dad.

145
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:35,410
<6-3,Foreman>Harmon先生?
<6-3,Foreman>Mr. Harmon?

146
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:37,690
<6-3,Foreman>Harmon先生
<6-3,Foreman>Mr. Harmon.

147
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,140
<6-4,Thirteen>你要去哪儿?
<6-4,Thirteen>Where are you going?

148
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:44,200
<6-5,Jerry>我约了人 我必须去
<6-5,Jerry>I have an appointment. I have to go.

149
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:47,080
<6-6,Thirteen>你在治疗中 几项检查结果还没出来
<6-6,Thirteen>We haven't finished with your treatment.abcWe're still waiting on some test results.

150
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:47,930
<6-7,Jerry>我约了人
<6-7,Jerry>I have an appointment.

151
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,370
<6-8,Foreman>不好意思 你要改时间了
<6-8,Foreman>Sorry, you're gonna have to reschedule.

152
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,590
<6-9,Jerry>我必须要走
<6-9,Jerry>I really have to go.

153
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:54,640
<6-10,Thirteen>Harmon先生 你知道你在哪儿吗?
<6-10,Thirteen>Mr. Harmon, do you know where you are?

154
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:57,490
<6-11,Jerry>干嘛老阻止我?
<6-11,Jerry>Why are you trying to stop me?

155
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,700
<6-12,Foreman>看他的眼睛
<6-12,Foreman>His eyes.

156
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:03,270
<6-13,Thirteen>是不是癫痫发作?
<6-13,Thirteen>is he having a seizure?

157
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,920
<6-14,Foreman>瞳孔对光反射正常
<6-14,Foreman>His pupils are responsive.

158
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,440
<6-14,Foreman>我觉得他是在...睡觉
<6-14,Foreman>I think he's... asleep.

159
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,330
<7-1,Taub>他只是在睡觉
<7-1,Taub>he was just asleep.

160
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,700
<7-1,Taub>说明没有记忆缺失
<7-1,Taub>Means no memory loss.

161
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:16,130
<7-1,Taub>梦游也不会要命
<7-1,Taub>And sleepwalking doesn't kill.

162
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,080
<7-1,Taub>除非他从窗户走出去了
<7-1,Taub>Unless he walks out a window.

163
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,420
<7-2,Foreman>梦游不是诊断 只是个症状而已
<7-2,Foreman>Sleepwalking's not aabcdiagnosis. It's a symptom.

164
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:20,930
<7-2,Foreman>我们还没找出原因来...
<7-2,Foreman>As long as we can'tabcfigure out why--

165
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,040
<7-3,Taub>压力诱导 失眠症 很多人都梦游
<7-3,Taub>stress-induced insomnia.abcLots of people sleepwalk.

166
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:25,770
<7-4,Foreman>但不是在大白天 甚至脑袋都没沾枕头时
<7-4,Foreman>Not in the middle of the day beforeabcthey've even put their head on a pillow.

167
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:29,100
<7-5,Kutner>有可能是发作性睡病 病因有...
<7-5,Kutner>Could be some sort ofabcnarcolepsy.Which is caused by--

168
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,880
<7-7,Kutner>这通常有遗传病史
<7-7,Kutner>there's usually genetic history.

169
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:32,320
<7-8,House>或是?
<7-8,House>Or?

170
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:35,390
<7-9,Thirteen>要是你知道答案的话 告诉我们不就行了
<7-9,Thirteen>If you know the answer,canabcyou tell us the answer?

171
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:36,660
<7-10,House>我不知道答案
<7-10,House>I don't know the answer.

172
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,840
<7-10,House>也就是又把我们绕回到...或是?
<7-10,House>Which bringsabcus back to--or?

173
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:41,120
<7-11,Kutner>由环境因素触发
<7-11,Kutner>Some sort of environmental trigger.

174
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:41,950
<7-12,House>也就是说?
<7-12,House>Which means?

175
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,770
<7-13,Taub>是毒素
<7-13,Taub>It's a toxin.

176
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:43,840
<7-14,House>所以我们要?
<7-14,House>So we are?

177
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,700
<7-15,Thirteen>被带到了一条烦人的路
<7-15,Thirteen>Being lead down an annoying path.

178
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,540
<7-16,House>我真的不知道要去向哪
<7-16,House>I honestly don't knowabcwhere this is going.

179
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,070
<7-16,House>只是跟着提示走
<7-16,House>Just following the clues.

180
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:50,290
<7-17,Taub>我们又回到原点了
<7-17,Taub>We're right back where we started.

181
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:52,360
<7-17,Taub>我们找到的霉菌不会导致这些症状
<7-17,Taub>The mold we found doesn'tabccause these symptoms.

182
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:54,820
<7-17,Taub>而且他的家中也没有什么其他因素了
<7-17,Taub>And there's nothing else at his home.

183
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:55,680
<7-18,House>还有?
<7-18,House>And?

184
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:56,860
<7-19,Thirteen>还有你很烦人
<7-19,Thirteen>And you're obnoxious.

185
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,230
<7-19,Thirteen>他从不出家门
<7-19,Thirteen>He never goes anywhere else.

186
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,640
<7-20,House>我们是怎么知道的呢?
<7-20,House>Which we know because?

187
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:00,940
<7-21,Thirteen>因为他这么说的
<7-21,Thirteen>Because he says so.

188
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:02,140
<7-21,Thirteen>因为他的女儿这么说的
<7-21,Thirteen>Because his daughter says so.

189
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,820
<7-21,Thirteen>因为他们没有理由撒谎
<7-21,Thirteen>Because they have no reason to lie.

190
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:07,840
<7-22,House>也就说明了他从不出家门...
<7-22,House>Which proves heabcnever goes anywhere else...

191
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:10,650
<7-22,House>当...
<7-22,House>when...

192
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:13,960
<7-23,Taub>他...
<7-23,Taub>he's...

193
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:17,790
<7-23,Taub>清醒的时候
<7-23,Taub>conscious.

194
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,550
<7-24,House>我的天哪 你说对了
<7-24,House>Oh, my god,you're right.

195
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:20,800
<7-25,Foreman>他说他有约
<7-25,Foreman>He said he had an appointment.

196
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:22,220
<7-26,House>下一次 让他去赴约
<7-26,House>Next time, let him keep it.

197
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:25,610
<7-26,House>送他回家 看看他梦游到哪里去了
<7-26,House>Send him home. Seeabcwhere his dreams take him.

198
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,790
<8-1,Cuddy>Becca?

<8-6,Becca>I can't stop eating them.

204
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,490
<8-6,Becca>就像上瘾一样
<8-6,Becca>I guess it's, like, a craving.

205
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:59,380
<8-6,Becca>一天得吃一打
<8-6,Becca>I must have, like,a dozen a day.

<8-14,Becca>My grandmother was married for 37 yearsabcto a man that treated her like garbage.

<8-14,Becca>要不是被我的衰爸甩了abc我妈也是这种下场
<8-14,Becca>And my mom would've stayed married to myabcloser dad that long,but he dumped her.

225

<8-14,Becca>我一直不明白她怎么会重蹈她妈妈的覆辙
<8-14,Becca>You know, I never understood how you couldabcfall for the same crap as your mother.

00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,890
<20-1,House>我需要你的建议
<20-1,House>I need your advice.

458
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:50,240
<20-2,Wilson>不是癌症
<20-2,Wilson>It's not cancer.

459
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:53,730
<20-3,House>你能用意念切除脾脏吗?
<20-3,House>Can you removeabcspleens with your mind too?

460
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:56,430
<20-4,Wilson>你想说的是Cuddy 病历只是个托辞
<20-4,Wilson>You're here to talk aboutabccuddy. The file is a pretext.

461
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,180
<20-5,House>为什么你不主动找我说Cuddy?
<20-5,House>Why the hell haven't you comeabcto talk to me about cuddy?

462
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:01,290
<20-5,House>我都干了这么多出格事了
<20-5,House>I've been doing allabcsorts of insane stuff.

463
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:04,230
<20-6,Wilson>如果她连你都搞不定 就别提一个宝宝了
<20-6,Wilson>If she can't handle yourabcinsanity, she can't handle a baby.

464
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:05,590
<20-7,House>我正是这么想的
<20-7,House>That's exactly my point.

465
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:06,720
<20-8,Wilson>不 你才不是
<20-8,Wilson>No, it isn't.

466
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:09,270
<20-8,Wilson>你觉得受到了威胁abc因为她升上高中了
<20-8,Wilson>You're feeling threatened becauseabcshe's going onto high school

467
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:11,670
<20-8,Wilson>只有你在原地踏步念八年级
<20-8,Wilson>and leaving you behind toabcrepeat the eighth grade.

468
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:14,300
<20-9,House>因为她靠和数学老师上床换文凭
<20-9,House>She's sleeping with the mathabcteacher to get a diploma.

469
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,410
<20-10,Wilson>收养孩子等同作弊?
<20-10,Wilson>Adoption is cheating?

470
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,680
<20-10,Wilson>他们会给她个假孩子不成?
<20-10,Wilson>Are they giving her a fake kid?

471
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,240
<20-11,House>这就是问题所在
<20-11,House>That's the problem.

472
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:21,940
<20-11,House>她即将和一个孩子相处abc但她和成人都相处不来
<20-11,House>She gets to have a relationship with aabckid, but she can't handle one with an adult.

473
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,850
<20-11,House>所以她想杀死她
<20-11,House>So she's gonna kill it.

474
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:26,340
<20-12,Wilson>经你一说 豁然开朗
<20-12,Wilson>Well, it does seem cleaner.

475
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:29,740
<20-12,Wilson>我看过病历了abc她的决定是正确的
<20-12,Wilson>I've seen the file. She'sabcmaking a judgment call.

476
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:31,830
<20-13,House>任何决定都是有原因的
<20-13,House>Decisions are never made in a vacuum.

477
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,910
<20-14,Wilson>你让她痛苦也是有原因的
<20-14,Wilson>Just like your decision toabcmake her miserable.

478
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:39,810
<20-14,Wilson>你这么做是因为你不能abc扯着她的小辫子去沾墨水了
<20-14,Wilson>You're doing this because we no longer haveabcinkwells and cuddy doesn't have pigtails.

479
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:47,330
<20-15,House>我啃你苹果的动机呢?
<20-15,House>Why do you think I did that?

480
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:55,120
<21-1,Taub>感觉如何?
<21-1,Taub>How you doing?

481
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:56,610
<21-2,Jerry>我不知道
<21-2,Jerry>Not sure.

482
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,780
<21-2,Jerry>照你说的 我一直看着时钟
<21-2,Jerry>Been keeping an eye onabcthe clock like you said.

483
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,270
<21-2,Jerry>我想我没有丢失任何时间
<21-2,Jerry>I don't think I lost any time.

484
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,730
<21-3,Taub>监测仪也证实了这点
<21-3,Taub>The machinery agrees with you.

485
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:04,300
<21-3,Taub>表明你的病症是可卡因引起的
<21-3,Taub>That means your problems wereabccaused by the coke.

486
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:05,740
<21-4,Jerry>不敢相信 我竟然会吸毒
<21-4,Jerry>Can't believe I did coke.

487
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,040
<21-5,Taub>你睡着了
<21-5,Taub>You were asleep.

488
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:09,130
<21-6,Jerry>我选择去吸毒
<21-6,Jerry>I chose to do coke.

489
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:11,050
<21-7,Taub>在睡梦中 你是没有责任的
<21-7,Taub>In your sleep. You weren't responsible.

490
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:13,340
<21-8,Jerry>潜意识的我想这么做
<21-8,Jerry>Something inside me wanted to do it.

491
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:15,630
<21-8,Jerry>潜意识的我不认为这是错的
<21-8,Jerry>Something inside ofabcme didn't think it was wrong.

492
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,860
<21-9,Taub>这和做梦一样
<21-9,Taub>It's like a dream.

493
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:19,500
<21-9,Taub>我们在梦中做的事情abc都是清醒时不会做的
<21-9,Taub>We all do stuff in our dreamsabcwe wouldn't do when we're awake.

<21-11,Taub>这是什么?
<21-11,Taub>What's that?

496
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:36,100
<21-12,Jerry>我睡着了 弄伤自己?
<21-12,Jerry>Did I fall asleep and hurt myself?

497
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:37,510
<21-12,Jerry>我看不到伤口
<21-12,Jerry>I don't see any cuts.

498
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,140
<21-13,Taub>因为根本没有

499
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:41,570
<21-13,Taub>我想...

503
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:55,040
<22-1,House>除了不想带他打棒球abc以及他命不久矣以外?
<22-1,House>Other than you don't want to playabcbasketball against him and he's dying?

504
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:57,060
<22-2,Foreman>可卡因和过敏不是病因所在
<22-2,Foreman>and neither cocaine orabcallergies are the answer.

00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:58,150
<22-3,Kutner>是系统性疾病
<22-3,Kutner>it's gotta be systemic.

506

<27-7,Cuddy>闭嘴
<27-7,Cuddy>Shut up.

608
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:49,260
<27-7,Cuddy>你知道只靠一个肾生活有多危险么?
<27-7,Cuddy>Do you understand the risks ofabcliving with one kidney?

609
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:50,130
<27-8,Samantha>我知道
<27-8,Samantha>Yeah.

610
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:52,150
<27-9,Cuddy>你仍旧愿意进行移植?
<27-9,Cuddy>And you still want toabcproceed with the transplant?

613
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:06,900
<27-12,House>不行
<27-12,House>No.

614
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:08,800
<27-13,Cuddy>我是说 你可以继续了
<27-13,Cuddy>I'm saying you can proceed.

615
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:11,430
<27-14,House>我是说 我不能继续
<27-14,House>I'm saying I can't.

616
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:17,440
<27-14,House>不管他得了什么病 她也得了
<27-14,House>Whatever he has,she has too.

617
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:20,840
<27-14,House>她在梦游
<27-14,House>She's sleepwalking.

618
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:26,340
<28-1,Kutner>如果不给他肾移植 他一周内就会死
<28-1,Kutner>if we don't give him a newabckidney, he's dead in a week.

619
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,810
<28-1,Kutner>必须给他移植
<28-1,Kutner>We have to transplant.

620
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:32,760
<28-2,House>遥控器没电了换个没电的电池还是没用
<28-2,House>When your remote has a dead battery, youabcdon't replace it with another dead battery.

621
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:36,320
<28-2,House>不论是什么破坏了父亲的肾abc它也会破坏这孩子的肾脏
<28-2,House>Whatever's killing the dad'sabckidneys is gonna kill the kid's too.

622
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:39,370
<28-3,Taub>也许梦游症在病理上并不相关
<28-3,Taub>It is possible the sleepabcissues aren't medically related.

623
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:42,310
<28-3,Taub>也许他们由于公路噪音都患有失眠症
<28-3,Taub>Maybe they're both insomniacsabcdue to the turnpike noise.

624
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,370
<28-3,Taub>也许他们都是咖啡喝多了 也许...
<28-3,Taub>Maybe they both drink tooabcmuch coffee, maybe--

625
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,710
<28-4,Thirteen>House是对的
<28-4,Thirteen>house is right.

626
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:46,630
<28-5,Taub>你怎么知道?
<28-5,Taub>How do you know?

627
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,950
<28-6,Thirteen>孩子也出现了汗血
<28-6,Thirteen>Because the daughter's sweating blood.

628
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,440
<28-6,Thirteen>症状相同 就意味着病因一致
<28-6,Thirteen>If they have the same thing, itabcmeans there has to bea common cause.

629
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:54,310
<28-6,Thirteen>也就是说 可能是毒素 感染 或者遗传
<28-6,Thirteen>Which means it has to be aabctoxin, infection, or genetic.

630
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,730
<28-6,Thirteen>而我们已排除了感染和毒素的可能...
<28-6,Thirteen>And since we've ruledabcoutinfections and toxins--

631
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:59,460
<28-7,Kutner>那也只是"缩小"到了无数abc遗传性障碍中的某一种
<28-7,Kutner>it narrows it down to anyabcone of a dozen genetic disorders,

632
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:02,640
<28-7,Kutner>每个检测都要花一个多星期
<28-7,Kutner>each of which takesabcmore than a week to run.

<28-8,House>给Foreman打个电话 动手干吧
<28-8,House>Call foreman. Get to work.

<29-1,Wilson>cuddy is positively aglow.

635
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:12,460
<29-1,Wilson>你怎么解释?
<29-1,Wilson>What's your theory?

636
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:15,320
<29-1,Wilson>她只是装开心来惹你生气?
<29-1,Wilson>She's only acting happyabcto make you miserable?

637
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:17,480
<29-2,House>我得找个遗传病

<29-5,Wilson>You paid off the pool?

641
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:27,320
<29-5,Wilson>严格说来 谁没打赌 谁就是赢家
<29-5,Wilson>Technically, anyone whoabcdidn't enter is a winner.

642
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:28,630
<29-6,House>还没完呢
<29-6,House>It's not over yet.

643
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,030

<29-7,Wilson>Adoption's a cheat,remember?

646
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:39,090
<29-7,Wilson>没有真正怀孕 就没有多巴胺受体的紊乱
<29-7,Wilson>There's no real pregnancy, so there'sabcno stranded dopamine receptors,

647
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,520
<29-7,Wilson>也不会有产后抑郁
<29-7,Wilson>so there's no postpartum depression.

658
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:17,670
<30-7,House>不知道 也许吧

659
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,860
<30-8,Foreman>那你刚干嘛说可以痊愈?

<30-9,House>让他们开心呗
<30-9,House>To make them happy.

662
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:25,670
<30-11,House>确切地说 是看他们能不能开心
<30-11,House>Technically, to seeabcif they can be happy.

00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:29,940
<30-11,House>本该看到一个微笑 眼波的闪动abc释然的叹息 之类的
<30-11,House>We should've seen a grin, a twinkle,abca sigh of relief, something.

<30-13,House>他们体内的多巴胺受体受损
<30-13,House>Something's bushwhackedabctheir dopamine receptors.

667
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:37,920
<30-14,Thirteen>他们是沮丧

<30-14,Thirteen>Mom's dead. Dad's dying.

<30-14,Thirteen>要知道 沮丧不一定就是病状
<30-14,Thirteen>You should know that being bummedabcisn't necessarily a pathology.

670
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:47,460
<30-15,House>沮丧无法解释他们为什么abc没有朋友 对彼此冷漠
<30-15,House>Being bummed doesn't explain their lack ofabcfriends or their indifference to each other.

671
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:50,570
<30-16,Taub>为什么他们家没有音乐 风景 装饰
<30-16,Taub>Why their place had noabcmusic, no view, no decor.

00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:55,980
<30-18,House>因为你很快乐?
<30-18,House>Because you're happy?

675
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,200
<30-18,House>大部分人嗑药 是因为想变得快乐
<30-18,House>Most people do 'em becauseabcthey want to be happy.

<30-18,House>他潜意识里渴望得到快乐
<30-18,House>His subconscious craved it,needed it.

677
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:02,650
<30-19,Foreman>快感缺失的病因通常是精神分裂
<30-19,Foreman>Most common cause ofabcanhedonia is schizophrenia.

678
