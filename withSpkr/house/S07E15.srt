<6-8,Taub>In med school, it seemed like

135
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,660
<6-8,Taub>都能很好的应对压力
<6-8,Taub>everybody else could handle the pressure.

136
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:48,320
<6-8,Taub>我却不能
<6-8,Taub>I couldn't.

137
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,560
<6-8,Taub>最后只得以自残告终
<6-8,Taub>I ended up hurting myself.

138
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:56,380
<6-8,Taub>这是我做过最蠢的事
<6-8,Taub>Stupidest thing I've ever done.

139
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:06,530
<6-8,Taub>你眼内有红色斑点
<6-8,Taub>You've got red spots in your eyes.

140
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:07,770
<6-8,Taub>之前没有的
<6-8,Taub>They weren't there before.

141
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:16,860
<7-1,Wilson>你皮肤不错
<7-1,Wilson>You have nice skin.

142
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:18,520
<7-2,Cuddy>谢谢  说什么呢
<7-2,Cuddy>Thank you. Shut up!

143
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:19,270
<7-2,Cuddy>不好意思
<7-2,Cuddy>Sorry.

144
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:21,370
<7-3,Wilson>我只是觉得如果不评论一下太不礼貌了
<7-3,Wilson>Just thought it would be rude not to comment.

145
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:23,490
<7-4,Cuddy>把我当一般病人就行
<7-4,Cuddy>Just treat me like any other patient.

146
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:24,490
<7-4,Cuddy>没错
<7-4,Cuddy>Right.

147
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,640
<7-5,Wilson>你是在吸气收小腹吗
<7-5,Wilson>Are you sucking in your stomach?

148
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:30,130
<7-5,Wilson>没有
<7-5,Wilson>No.

149
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,710
<7-6,Cuddy>赶紧在我憋昏过去之前弄完
<7-6,Cuddy>Hurry up before I pass out.

150
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:38,690
<7-7,Cuddy>威尔森
<7-7,Cuddy>Wilson?

151
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:45,260
<7-8,Wilson>超声波不是最可靠的
<7-8,Wilson>Ultrasound isn't definitive.

152
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,640
<7-8,Wilson>我们需要做其它测试才能
<7-8,Wilson>We should run other tests before--

153
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:48,860
<7-9,Cuddy>别来医生那一套  告诉我你看到了什么
<7-9,Cuddy>Stop talking like a doctor and tell me what you see.

154
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,940
<7-10,Wilson>你的肾里有个团块
<7-10,Wilson>There's a mass in your kidney.

155
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:01,040
<8-1,Taub>我们还是不知道瑞安为什么会咳血
<8-1,Taub>We still don't know why Ryan coughed blood,

156
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:03,840
<8-1,Taub>现在他眼底又有少量出血
<8-1,Taub>and now he's got small hemorrhages in his eyes.

157
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:05,250
<8-2,Foreman>听上去像后天获得性凝血病变
<8-2,Foreman>Sounds like an acquired coagulapathy

158
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,990
<8-2,Foreman>这可能有多种鉴别诊断
<8-2,Foreman>which gives us a pretty wide differential.

159
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,940
<8-3,Masters>如果考虑到抑郁
<8-3,Masters>It gets a lot narrower

160
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,080
<8-3,Masters>范围就能大大缩小了
<8-3,Masters>if we factor in his depression.

161
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:11,450
<8-4,House>别这样
<8-4,House>Oh, don't do that!

162
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:14,490
<8-5,Masters>情绪波动可能是生理疾病导致的症状
<8-5,Masters>Mood swings can be a symptom of physiological illness.

163
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,490
<8-6,House>没跟你说话
<8-6,House>I'm not talking to you.

164
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,590
<8-7,Taub>情绪波动也可能是青春期
<8-7,Taub>Mood swings are also a symptom of adolescence

165
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,960
<8-7,Taub>伴随摇滚乐和手淫出现的症状
<8-7,Taub>along with emo music and masturbation.

166
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:21,400
<8-7,Taub>更重要的是  他的体重减少
<8-7,Taub>More importantly, his weight loss

167
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:23,010
<8-7,Taub>以及睡眠问题从一年前就开始了
<8-7,Taub>and sleeping issues started a year ago.

168
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,310
<8-8,Chase>感染最有可能
<8-8,Chase>Infection makes the most sense.

169
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,520
<8-8,Chase>他在学校打篮球  在更衣室洗澡
<8-8,Chase>He shoots hoops at school, showers in the locker room.

170
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,330
<8-8,Chase>-我觉得是葡萄球菌感染  -该死
<8-8,Chase>- I'm thinking staph. - Damn!

171
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:29,490
<8-10,Masters>你不认为
<8-10,Masters>You don't think--

172
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,120
<8-11,House>没跟你说话
<8-11,House>Not talking to you!

173
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,820
<8-12,Chase>-卡迪没事吧  -她没事
<8-12,Chase>- Everything okay with Cuddy? - She's fine.

174
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,650
<8-13,House>只不过她听风就是雨
<8-13,House>She's just too stupid to accept it.

175
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:40,050
<8-13,House>用青霉素治疗葡萄球菌感染
<8-13,House>Start him on nafcillin for staph.

176
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,400
<9-1,Cuddy>那些都在
<9-1,Cuddy>All that's in the, uh,

177
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:45,400
<9-1,Cuddy>第一银行的保险柜里
<9-1,Cuddy>First Mutual safety deposit box.

178
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:47,230
<9-1,Cuddy>退休金
<9-1,Cuddy>The retirement accounts--

179
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:52,060
<9-2,House>一个不称职的非洲猩猩做的超声波检查
<9-2,House>You're freaking out because of one ultrasound

180
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:54,430
<9-2,House>就能把你吓成这样
<9-2,House>performed by an incompetent bonobo monkey.

181
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,380
<9-3,Cuddy>我还坐在这镇定的
<9-3,Cuddy>As demonstrated by my sitting here calmly

182
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,580
<9-3,Cuddy>处理事务正好佐证了你的话
<9-3,Cuddy>going about my business.

183
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:59,490
<9-4,House>叫律师来起草遗嘱
<9-4,House>Calling a lawyer, drafting a will!

184
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,960
<9-4,House>好吧  我...
<9-4,House>Okay. I-I...

185
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,840
<9-4,House>偷看了你网上的日程安排
<9-4,House>hacked into your online schedule.

186
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,740
<9-4,House>检查总能查出点什么
<9-4,House>Look, tests always show something.

187
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,850
<9-4,House>你肾里的团块可能只是复合囊肿
<9-4,House>A mass in your kidney could be a complex cyst.

188
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,550
<9-5,Cuddy>-很可能是良性的  -我是单身母亲
<9-5,Cuddy>- It could be benign. - I'm a single mom.

189
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,770
<9-5,Cuddy>我需要建立信托基金  指定监护人
<9-5,Cuddy>I need to set up a trust, appoint a guardian.

190
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,370
<9-5,Cuddy>我以前没做才是太傻了
<9-5,Cuddy>It's silly that I haven't done it before now.

191
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,220
<9-6,House>但你现在做是因为你觉得你病了
<9-6,House>But you're doing it now because you think you're sick.

192
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,700
<9-6,House>你至少可以等到下午的活检结果
<9-6,House>The freaking out can at least wait

193
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:18,350
<9-6,House>出来以后再开始惊慌失措
<9-6,House>until after the biopsy this afternoon.

194
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,520
<9-7,Cuddy>活检结果明天才会出来
<9-7,Cuddy>The biopsy's not till tomorrow.

195
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:21,270
<9-7,Cuddy>已经是预约的第一个了
<9-7,Cuddy>It's the first opening in the schedule.

196
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:23,290
<9-8,House>对于医院院长
<9-8,House>For the dean of medicine,

197
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,000
<9-8,House>第一个就意味着...
<9-8,House>the first opening in the schedule is...

198
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:26,100
<9-8,House>看  就是现在
<9-8,House>Oh, look! Now.

199
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:28,960
<9-9,Cuddy>我的担忧并不比其他人的更重要
<9-9,Cuddy>My worry isn't any more important than anyone else's.

200
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:29,820
<9-10,House>实际上  就要比别人重要
<9-10,House>Actually, it is.

201
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,200
<9-11,Cuddy>但我没病  对吧
<9-11,Cuddy>But I'm not sick, right?

202
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,030
<9-12,House>说得好
<9-12,House>Good point.

203
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:44,690
<10-1,Roid Rage>我要我的货  混蛋
<10-1,Roid Rage>I want my stuff, asshat.

204
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,750
<10-2,Ryan>我跟你说过了  兄弟  货不在这里
<10-2,Ryan>I told you, man, I don't have it here.

205
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:48,980
<10-3,Taub>伙计们
<10-3,Taub>Guys.

206
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:50,450
<10-3,Taub>一切都还好吗
<10-3,Taub>Everything okay?

207
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,600
<10-4,Roid Rage>我这就走
<10-4,Roid Rage>On my way out.

208
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,480
<10-4,Roid Rage>回头见
<10-4,Roid Rage>I'll see you later.

209
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:03,010
<10-5,Taub>你想  告诉我这是怎么回事吗
<10-5,Taub>You wanna... tell me what's going on?

210
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:12,370
<10-6,Ryan>我朋友去换领癫痫药时
<10-6,Ryan>My friend gave me some leftover klonopin he had

211
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,110
<10-6,Ryan>给了我一些多余的克诺平[抗焦虑药]
<10-6,Ryan>when he switched his seizure meds.

212
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,490
<10-6,Ryan>我八十块卖给了洛依德·瑞吉
<10-6,Ryan>I sold them to Roid Rage for 80 bucks,

213
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,670
<10-6,Ryan>但在交货前我就住进来了
<10-6,Ryan>but I landed in here before I could deliver,

214
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,640
<10-6,Ryan>现在他该废了我了
<10-6,Ryan>and now he's gonna rip my arms off.

215
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:22,840
<10-7,Taub>你多久卖一次药
<10-7,Taub>How often do you sell drugs?

216
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,660
<10-7,Taub>仅此一次
<10-7,Taub>It was a one-time thing.

217
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,700
<10-8,Ryan>我需要钱  手里又有药
<10-8,Ryan>I needed the cash, I had the pills,

218
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:27,880
<10-8,Ryan>我就琢磨  何乐而不为呢
<10-8,Ryan>so I thought, "Why not?"

219
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,930
<10-8,Ryan>这主意糟透了
<10-8,Ryan>It was a bad idea.

220
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,520
<10-8,Ryan>药在我家
<10-8,Ryan>The pills are at my house.

221
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:34,980
<10-8,Ryan>我可以让朋友去拿来
<10-8,Ryan>I could have a friend go get them.

222
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,420
<10-9,Taub>把钱还给那痞子
<10-9,Taub>Give the thug his money back.

223
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,170
<10-9,Taub>仅此一次
<10-9,Taub>One time only.

224
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:57,540
<11-1,Cuddy>我是说  如果你觉得这样可以的话
<11-1,Cuddy>I mean, if you're okay with this.

225
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,110
<11-1,Cuddy>你自己还有三个孩子
<11-1,Cuddy>You have three kids of your own.

226
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,850
<11-2,Julia>这还用问吗
<11-2,Julia>It's not even a question.

227
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,410
<11-2,Julia>我当然愿意当瑞秋的监护人
<11-2,Julia>Of course I'll be Rachel's guardian.

228
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:04,650
<11-2,Julia>豪斯对这没意见吗
<11-2,Julia>And House is cool with this?

229
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,680
<11-2,Julia>我是说  你们
<11-2,Julia>I mean, you guys...

230
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:07,280
<11-3,Cuddy>我们在一起才几个月
<11-3,Cuddy>We've only been together a few months.

231
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:08,990
<11-4,Julia>感觉上已经很久了
<11-4,Julia>Hmm. Seems like a lot longer.

232
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:10,320
<11-4,Julia>可能是因为你已经
<11-4,Julia>Probably because you've been talking

233
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,210
<11-4,Julia>谈论他有十年了
<11-4,Julia>about him for ten years.

234
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,110
<11-4,Julia>我说的谈论是指
<11-4,Julia>And by talking, I mean ranting about

235
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,640
<11-4,Julia>你一直嚷嚷要用订书机
<11-4,Julia>wanting to smash his teeth in

236
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:16,730
<11-4,Julia>把这混蛋的牙打碎
<11-4,Julia>with a stapler for being such a jerk.

237
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:20,020
<11-5,Cuddy>人是会变的
<11-5,Cuddy>People change.

239
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:26,880
<12-1,Wilson>我来开
<12-1,Wilson>I'll get it.

240

<12-3,Sitcom Studio Audience>That better be her!

241
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,600
<12-4,Wilson>瑞秋·卡迪
<12-4,Wilson>Rachel Cuddy,

242
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,850
<12-4,Wilson>你半小时前就该回家了
<12-4,Wilson>you were supposed to be home half an hour ago.

243
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,110
<12-5,Rachel>别怪我  是他
<12-5,Rachel>Don't blame me-- he's the one

244
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,400
<12-5,Rachel>不愿意闯红灯的
<12-5,Rachel>who wouldn't run any red lights.

245
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:43,870
<12-6,Cop>这孩子的嘴
<12-6,Cop>Mouth on that kid

246
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,410
<12-6,Cop>能让梅尔·吉布森变成尼尔森·曼德拉
<12-6,Cop>makes Mel Gibson sound like Nelson Mandela.

248
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,730
<12-6,Cop>她这都从哪学的
<12-6,Cop>Where'd she learn that?

249
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:54,000
<12-7,House>我不知道你为啥在这儿
<12-7,House>I don't know why you're here,

250
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:55,100
<12-7,House>不过不是我干的
<12-7,House>but I didn't do it.

251
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,420
<12-8,Wilson>有什么问题吗  警官
<12-8,Wilson>What's the problem, officer?

252
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:00,600
<12-9,Cop>她在商场里偷东西
<12-9,Cop>She was shoplifting down at the mall.

253
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,530
<12-11,Cop>你们俩谁是这女孩的父亲
<12-11,Cop>Are either of you this girl's father?

254
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,740
<12-12,House>都不是  不过自打她妈死了以后
<12-12,House>Nope. But since her mom died,

255
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,710
<12-12,House>她倒成了我最好的免税理由
<12-12,House>she's my favorite tax write-off.

256
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:10,290
<12-12,House>警官  我保证下不为例
<12-12,House>Officer, you have my word it won't happen again.

257
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:11,920
<12-12,House>因为下次
<12-12,House>'Cause next time...

258
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,370
<12-12,House>她绝不会再被抓着了
<12-12,House>she won't get caught!

260
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:35,420
<13-1,Taub>没什么大不了的
<13-1,Taub>It's no big deal.

261
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,190
<13-1,Taub>你能这么想挺好
<13-1,Taub>Good for you.

262
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,470
<13-2,Masters>你本可以认为他是个毒贩子
<13-2,Masters>You could have just assumed he was a drug dealer,

263
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,860
<13-2,Masters>但你相信了他的话
<13-2,Masters>but you took his word for it.

264
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:46,070
<13-2,Masters>真高兴终于看到这里有人
<13-2,Masters>It's nice to finally see someone

265
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,040
<13-2,Masters>依然对人性存有一丝信心了
<13-2,Masters>have a little faith in humanity around here.

266
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:51,350
<13-3,Taub>你为什么要这么做
<13-3,Taub>Why would you do that?

267
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,920
<13-3,Taub>-瑞安  你在里边还好吧  -我不知道
<13-3,Taub>- Ryan, you okay in there?  - I'm not sure.

268
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:01,400
<13-4,Ryan>我想我刚尿血了
<13-4,Ryan>I think I just peed blood.

269
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,540
<13-4,Ryan>看来尿血成了新风潮了
<13-4,Ryan>Looks like peeing blood is the new black.

270
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:11,560
<14-1,House>头晚使用抗生素第二天尿血
<14-1,House>Peeing blood after a night on antibiotics

271
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:13,150
<14-2,Foreman>说明可以确定不是感染了
<14-2,Foreman>means we can move on from infections.

272
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,000
<14-3,Taub>窥镜检查没发现他膀胱内出血
<14-3,Taub>Scoping showed no sign of a bleed in his bladder,

273
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:16,250
<14-3,Taub>说明是肾有问题
<14-3,Taub>which points to a kidney problem.

274
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,500
<14-4,House>可能是什么团块
<14-4,House>Probably some kinda mass.

275
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:19,380
<14-5,Chase>肾脏团块解释不了咳血
<14-5,Chase>Kidney mass wouldn't explain the coughing blood

276
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,380
<14-5,Chase>和眼内的血点
<14-5,Chase>or the hemorrhages.

277
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:22,440
<14-5,Chase>但是  抗磷脂综合征
<14-5,Chase>Antiphospholipid syndrome, on the other hand...

278
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,920
<14-6,House>靠点谱  但也不能排除有团块
<14-6,House>Makes sense. But doesn't rule out a mass.

279
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:26,130
<14-7,Masters>你觉得是癌症吗
<14-7,Masters>You think it's cancer?

280
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,870
<14-8,House>团块不一定是癌症
<14-8,House>Mass doesn't have to be cancer.

281
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,980
<14-8,House>可能是肾脏水肿
<14-8,House>Could be renal hematoma.

282
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,230
<14-9,Masters>但病人没有
<14-9,Masters>But the patient doesn't have

283
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,460
<14-9,Masters>-任何腹部创伤  -他
<14-9,Masters>- any other abdominal trauma. - He's...

284
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,090
<14-10,Chase>没在说这个病人
<14-10,Chase>not talking about the patient.

285
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,540
<14-11,Masters>卡迪肾脏有个团块吗
<14-11,Masters>Cuddy has a mass on her kidney?

286
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:40,850
<14-12,House>可能只是个复合囊肿
<14-12,House>It's probably just a complex cyst

287
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,230
<14-12,House>或者是血管瘤
<14-12,House>or angiomyolipoma.

288
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,910
<14-13,Foreman>是个团块  又不是个谜
<14-13,Foreman>It's a mass, not a mystery.

289
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:46,760
<14-13,Foreman>他们会做活检的  然后就有答案了
<14-13,Foreman>They'll do the biopsy, then you'll have your answer.

290
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:48,240
<14-13,Foreman>只是  得再等等
<14-13,Foreman>Just...have to wait.

291
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,400
<14-14,Taub>病人承认吸过大麻
<14-14,Taub>Patient admitted to using pot.

292
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:53,710
<14-14,Taub>谁知道他还吸过什么
<14-14,Taub>Who knows what else he's doing.

293
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,930
<14-14,Taub>这可能是海洛因相关性肾病
<14-14,Taub>This could be a heroin-induced nephropathy.

294
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,070
<14-15,Masters>我以为你相信这孩子的
<14-15,Masters>I thought you trusted this kid.

295
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,220
<14-16,Taub>直到你指出我的做法很贴心
<14-16,Taub>And then you pointed out how sweet that was.

296
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:01,530
<14-17,House>如果是海洛因  他会有戒断反应
<14-17,House>If it were heroin, he'd be going through withdrawal.

297
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,620
<14-17,House>抗磷脂综合征更合适
<14-17,House>Antiphospholipid syndrome's a better fit.

298
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:05,680
<14-17,House>给病人用血浆除去法
<14-17,House>Start the patient on plasmapheresis.

299
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:07,510
<14-18,Taub>他做检查的时候
<14-18,Taub>While he's doing that,

300
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,180
<14-18,Taub>我能去搜查他家里有没有毒品吗
<14-18,Taub>can I at least search his house for drugs?

301
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:10,970
<14-19,House>还用问吗
<14-19,House>Have I ever said no to that question?

302
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,250
<15-1,House>你在这干什么呢
<15-1,House>What are you doing here?

303
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:19,970
<15-2,Wilson>吃馅饼大赛
<15-2,Wilson>Pie-eating contest.

304
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:22,470
<15-3,House>一小时后卡迪就要进行活检了
<15-3,House>Cuddy's biopsy is in an hour.

305
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,120
<15-3,House>你现在应该陪着她
<15-3,House>You should be keeping her company.

306
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:28,390
<15-4,Wilson>好吧  你担心你们的关系
<15-4,Wilson>Okay. You've been worried that your relationship

307
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,140
<15-4,Wilson>会影响你的诊断
<15-4,Wilson>is getting in the way of your diagnoses,

308
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,960
<15-4,Wilson>所以你是在保护你的病人
<15-4,Wilson>you're protecting your patient.

309
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:34,560
<15-4,Wilson>要么是这样  要么你就是个混蛋
<15-4,Wilson>Either that or... you're an ass.

310
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:37,600
<15-5,House>我选三  因为我讨厌死亡的气味
<15-5,House>Three--I hate the smell of death.

311
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:41,400
<15-6,Wilson>卡迪患肾细胞癌的几率
<15-6,Wilson>The chances of Cuddy having renal cell carcinoma--

312
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:43,140
<15-7,House>我说的是咱俩的友谊
<15-7,House>I'm talking about our relationship.

313
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:44,400
<15-7,House>她需要支持和安慰
<15-7,House>She needs support and comfort,

314
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:46,410
<15-7,House>都是我出了名搞不定的
<15-7,House>both things that I famously suck at.

315
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,810
<15-7,House>这样会不可避免地导致
<15-7,House>This will inevitably lead to--

316
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:51,280
<15-8,Wilson>你知道怎么才能进步吗  练习
<15-8,Wilson>You know what's good for that? Practice.

317
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:54,680
<15-8,Wilson>去做  我不知道  一次
<15-8,Wilson>Doing it--I don't know-- once?

318
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:56,150
<15-9,House>在知道结果以前
<15-9,House>I'm not gonna act like there's a crisis

319
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,710
<15-9,House>我才不会装得煞有介事
<15-9,House>before we know there is one.

320
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,430
<15-9,House>没有证据表明她有事
<15-9,House>There's no proof there's anything wrong with her.

321
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,500
<15-10,Wilson>也没有证据说明她被
<15-10,Wilson>There's no proof she's being stalked

322
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:02,030
<15-10,Wilson>忍者松鼠跟踪
<15-10,Wilson>by ninja squirrels either,

323
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,570
<15-10,Wilson>但如果她害怕的话
<15-10,Wilson>but if she's scared of them...

324
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:06,510
<15-10,Wilson>作为她的男友  你有义务要想法子
<15-10,Wilson>as her boyfriend, it's your job to figure out

325
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,290
<15-10,Wilson>让她好受些
<15-10,Wilson>how to help her feel better.

326
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:14,580
<15-11,House>你说得对
<15-11,House>You're right.

327
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:25,930
<16-1,Chase>豪斯让我来陪陪你
<16-1,Chase>House told me to keep you company.

328
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,390
<16-1,Chase>护士让我给你吃抗生素
<16-1,Chase>Nurse told me to give you antibiotics.

329
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,930
<16-2,Cuddy>告诉豪斯我没事
<16-2,Cuddy>Tell House I'm fine.

330
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:40,380
<16-3,Chase>汤姆·克鲁斯结婚了
<16-3,Chase>Tom Cruise got married.

331
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:52,310
<16-3,Chase>你想让我引用哥多林前书的桥段吗
<16-3,Chase>Do you want me to quote from First Corinthians?

332
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:54,140
<16-3,Chase>[哥多林前书是圣经全书第46本书]
<16-3,Chase>[也是使徒保罗为哥林多人所写的第一封书信]

333
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,150
<16-3,Chase>-因为我可以哦  -作为一个犹太人
<16-3,Chase>- 'Cause I can do that. - As a Jew,

334
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,810
<16-4,Cuddy>我不得不谢绝你的提议
<16-4,Cuddy>I'm gonna have to decline that offer.

335
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:56,890
<16-5,Chase>不知道你会错过什么吧
<16-5,Chase>Don't know what you're missing.

336
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,640
<16-5,Chase>圣保罗可是很在行呢
<16-5,Chase>St. Paul was really on his game.

337
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,160
<16-5,Chase>他最终会来的
<16-5,Chase>He'll show up eventually.

338
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:09,920
<16-6,Cuddy>其实你都不信自己说的话
<16-6,Cuddy>You don't actually believe that.

339
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,000
<16-6,Cuddy>但我相信
<16-6,Cuddy>But I do.

340
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:14,290
<16-6,Cuddy>这么多年
<16-6,Cuddy>All these years,

341
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,710
<16-6,Cuddy>他十五分钟不来骚扰我一下
<16-6,Cuddy>He's never stopped trying to annoy me

342
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,380
<16-6,Cuddy>都忍不住
<16-6,Cuddy>for more than 15 minutes.

343
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,050
<16-6,Cuddy>而他现在甚至都不敢进来
<16-6,Cuddy>And now he can't even walk into the room.

344
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,870
<16-7,Chase>有爱就有希望
<16-7,Chase>Love hopes all things.

345
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:30,560
<17-1,Foreman>你和这孩子到底怎么回事
<17-1,Foreman>What is it with you and this kid?

346
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:35,180
<17-2,Taub>他在苦海里挣扎
<17-2,Taub>He's doggy paddling in a sea of misery.

347
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:36,400
<17-2,Taub>我记得那是什么感觉
<17-2,Taub>I remember what it's like.

348
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:37,960
<17-3,Foreman>这段回忆离你有多远
<17-3,Foreman>How far did you have to reach back for that memory,

349
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,940
<17-3,Foreman>昨晚吗
<17-3,Foreman>last night?

350
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:40,740
<17-3,Foreman>有时我听到你半夜三点
<17-3,Foreman>Sometimes I hear you in the living room

351
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,220
<17-3,Foreman>在客厅里看电视
<17-3,Foreman>watching TV at 3:00 a.m.

352
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:45,260
<17-3,Foreman>那是BBC播放经典《神秘医生》的时间
<17-3,Foreman>That's when classic Dr. Who comes on the BBC.

353
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,560
<17-4,Foreman>是啊  要是他们有个设备
<17-4,Foreman>Yeah. If only they had some device

354
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:48,790
<17-4,Foreman>能让你把节目录下来
<17-4,Foreman>that allowed you to record them

355
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,030
<17-4,Foreman>回头再看就好了
<17-4,Foreman>and watch them another time.

356
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,350
<17-4,Foreman>我是说...
<17-4,Foreman>I'm just saying...

357
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,570
<17-4,Foreman>我不觉得治好这孩子你就没事了
<17-4,Foreman>I don't think fixing this kid is gonna fix you.

358
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:56,580
<17-4,Foreman>咋了
<17-4,Foreman>Yep?

359
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:59,510
<17-4,Foreman>我们马上回去
<17-4,Foreman>We're on our way back.

360
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,800
<17-4,Foreman>病人右臂完全失去知觉了
<17-4,Foreman>Our patient lost all feeling in his right arm.

361
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:03,820
<17-5,Taub>看这个
<17-5,Taub>Look at this.

363
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:33,890
<18-1,House>奇斯
<18-1,House>Chase?

364
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:37,180
<18-1,House>卡迪怎么样了
<18-1,House>How'd it go with Cuddy?

365
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:41,810
<18-1,House>奇斯
<18-1,House>Chase?

366
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:23,710
<18-3,House>好在我带了我的斧头拐杖来
<18-3,House>Good thing I brought my ax cane.

367
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:27,100
<18-4,Cuddy>豪斯  救命
<18-4,Cuddy>House...help me!

368
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:29,790
<18-5,House>我来了
<18-5,House>I'm coming!

369
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:34,590
<18-6,Cuddy>豪斯  快啊
<18-6,Cuddy>House...please!

370
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,700
<18-7,House>看来同伴不少啊
<18-7,House>It looks like we got company.

371
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:00,940
<18-7,House>豪斯
<18-7,House>House!

372
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:22,230
<19-1,House>不
<19-1,House>No!

373
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:25,270
<19-2,Masters>你没事吧
<19-2,Masters>Are you okay?

374
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,650
<19-3,House>我就是睡着了
<19-3,House>I was sleeping.

375
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:32,120
<19-3,House>能有什么事
<19-3,House>What could go wrong?

376
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,810
<20-1,Masters>病人正用着类固醇
<20-1,Masters>Patient lost feeling in his arm

377
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,400
<20-1,Masters>他的胳膊失去了知觉  排除了自体免疫疾病
<20-1,Masters>while on steroids-- rules out autoimmune.

378
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:43,030
<20-2,Foreman>那是什么会引起出血  肾功能障碍
<20-2,Foreman>So what causes bleeding, kidney problems,

379
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,550
<20-2,Foreman>以及单侧肢体麻痹呢
<20-2,Foreman>and unilateral numbness?

380
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,710
<20-3,House>卡迪的肾脏活检
<20-3,House>And a complete absence of any record

381
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,810
<20-3,House>没留下任何记录
<20-3,House>of Cuddy's kidney biopsy.

382
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,720
<20-3,House>她肯定用了化名
<20-3,House>She must have put it under a false name

383
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,510
<20-3,House>这样我就没法去催结果了
<20-3,House>so I couldn't rush the results.

384
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:55,200
<20-4,Chase>如果我们反过来思考
<20-4,Chase>What if we had it backwards

385
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:57,270
<20-4,Chase>这也许不是出血问题  而是凝血问题
<20-4,Chase>and it's not a bleeding problem, it's a clotting problem?

386
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,800
<20-5,House>最近两天  没有为做肾脏活检
<20-5,House>There's no patient file created in the last two days

387
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:01,630
<20-5,House>而建立的新病例
<20-5,House>for anyone having that procedure.

388
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,210
<20-6,Masters>她把病例的日期提前了吗
<20-6,Masters>She backdated the file?

389
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:04,570
<20-6,Masters>很聪明的办法
<20-6,Masters>That's very clever.

390
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:06,360
<20-7,House>别多管闲事  她是我的
<20-7,House>Hands off. She's mine.

391
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:07,500
<20-8,Foreman>血栓可以解释全部症状
<20-8,Foreman>Clots could explain everything

392
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:08,890
<20-8,Foreman>包括肢体麻痹
<20-8,Foreman>including the numbness.

393
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:10,190
<20-8,Foreman>我们可以做脑部血管造影
<20-8,Foreman>We should do an angiogram of his brain,

394
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,330
<20-8,Foreman>看能不能找到血栓
<20-8,Foreman>see if we can find it.

395
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:17,610
<20-8,Foreman>豪斯
<20-8,Foreman>House.

396
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,110
<20-9,Chase>我们也很担心
<20-9,Chase>We're worried too.

397
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,640
<20-9,Chase>好感人呀
<20-9,Chase>How sweet.

398
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,300
<20-10,House>我不担心
<20-10,House>I'm not worried.

399
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:24,470
<20-10,House>我就是想快点得到结果
<20-10,House>I just wanna get the results

400
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:25,340
<20-10,House>这样她就不用担心了
<20-10,House>so she can stop worrying.

401
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:27,550
<20-11,Chase>-但同时  -去做血管造影
<20-11,Chase>- Okay, but in the meantime-- - Do an angiogram.

402
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,800
<20-12,House>你们两个去病理科看看卡迪的切片
<20-12,House>You two go to pathology and look at Cuddy's slides.

403
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:31,760
<20-13,Masters>你刚才还说不知道哪个切片是她的
<20-13,Masters>You just said you didn't know which sample was hers.

404
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,460
<20-14,House>我猜你们只能把所有的切片都看了
<20-14,House>I guess you're gonna have to look at them all.

405
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:40,720
<21-1,Chase>更大的问题是  陶博在搞什么
<21-1,Chase>Bigger question-- what's the deal with Taub?

406
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,630
<21-1,Chase>豪斯心不在焉  没注意到你心不在焉
<21-1,Chase>Just because House is too distracted

407
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,090
<21-1,Chase>并不意味着我们也注意不到
<21-1,Chase>to notice your distraction doesn't mean we didn't.

408
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,540
<21-2,Taub>血栓  血管造影  我很专心
<21-2,Taub>Clots, angiograms-- I'm focused.

409
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,830
<21-2,Taub>那小孩把班级纪念册上一半同学的脸都涂黑了
<21-2,Taub>The kid scratched out the faces of half his class.

410
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,810
<21-2,Taub>你不觉得这是个问题吗
<21-2,Taub>You don't think that's a problem?

411
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,910
<21-3,Foreman>这不是我们的问题
<21-3,Foreman>It's not our problem.

412
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,440
<21-4,Chase>这怎么就算个问题了
<21-4,Chase>Why is it anyone's problem?

413
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:55,470
<21-4,Chase>我曾经在脑海里把十年级的几何老师
<21-4,Chase>I violently executed my tenth grade geometry teacher

414
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,800
<21-4,Chase>用异常残酷的方法处死过五次
<21-4,Chase>about five different ways in my mind.

415
00:19:57,810 --> 00:19:59,120
<21-5,Masters>我从来没想过要去杀人
<21-5,Masters>I didn't want to kill anybody.

416
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:02,110
<21-5,Masters>我只想把他们关在地下室里慢慢折磨他们
<21-5,Masters>I just wanted to torture them slowly in my basement,

417
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,400
<21-5,Masters>最好是用酸
<21-5,Masters>preferably with acid.

418
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,130
<21-5,Masters>你们就从来没想过要怎么蹂躏豪斯吗
<21-5,Masters>You guys ever think about what you might to do House?

419
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:17,760
<21-6,Foreman>也许这没什么大不了的
<21-6,Foreman>Maybe it's no big deal.

420
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,420
<21-7,Chase>如果是  问题就大了
<21-7,Chase>Unless it is.

421
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:21,320
<21-7,Chase>有没有人想枪杀豪斯的
<21-7,Chase>Someone shot house?

422
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,240
<22-1,Wilson>你在干什么
<22-1,Wilson>What are you doing?

423
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,910
<22-2,House>吃馅饼比赛
<22-2,House>Pie-eating contest.

424
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:37,950
<22-3,Wilson>我本来想让奇斯
<22-3,Wilson>I was going to send Chase

425
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,210
<22-3,Wilson>来告诉你  你现在最该做的事情是什么
<22-3,Wilson>to tell you what the obvious right thing to do here is,

426
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,490
<22-3,Wilson>但我又想到
<22-3,Wilson>but then I realized...

427
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,760
<22-3,Wilson>如果你愚蠢到无法看出那样做有多傻的话
<22-3,Wilson>if you were too stupid to know how stupid that was,

428
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:46,490
<22-3,Wilson>我的讽刺就变成对牛弹琴了
<22-3,Wilson>you might miss the irony.

429
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,920
<22-3,Wilson>你得去陪她
<22-3,Wilson>You have to be with her.

430
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:49,840
<22-4,House>是的  我知道
<22-4,House>Yeah. I get it.

431
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,740
<22-4,House>她因为一个虚无缥缈的问题
<22-4,House>She needs artificial support

432
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,470
<22-4,House>需要我矫揉造作的支持
<22-4,House>for an artificial problem.

433
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,690
<22-4,House>她很好  奇斯做得很不错
<22-4,House>She's fine. Chase did an excellent job.

434
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:58,700
<22-5,Wilson>她又不跟奇斯上床
<22-5,Wilson>She doesn't sleep with Chase.

435
00:20:58,710 --> 00:20:59,850
<22-6,House>这我们就不知道了
<22-6,House>We don't know that.

436
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,840
<22-6,House>我正在这里吃馅饼呢
<22-6,House>Eating pie in here.

437
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:05,540
<22-6,House>豪斯
<22-6,House>House...

438
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:07,370
<22-7,Wilson>我不会再跟你讲第三遍
<22-7,Wilson>I'm not gonna tell you a third time.

439
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:08,790
<22-7,Wilson>这次千万别搞砸
<22-7,Wilson>Do not screw this up.

440
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:11,250
<22-7,Wilson>我真不想替你收拾残局
<22-7,Wilson>Because I really don't wanna clean up the mess.

441
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:15,890
<22-8,House>他在说馅饼
<22-8,House>He's referring to the pie.

442
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:18,020
<22-9,Masters>做肾脏活检的有十四位病人
<22-9,Masters>14 patients with kidney biopsies.

443
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:21,280
<22-9,Masters>我对照了他们尿检的结果
<22-9,Masters>I tabulated them against their urinalysis results.

444
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:23,210
<22-9,Masters>六名男性  三位糖尿病患者
<22-9,Masters>Six men, three diabetics,

445
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,160
<22-9,Masters>一名轻链沉积病患者  一个小孩  两位老人
<22-9,Masters>one LCDD, one kid, two seniors,

446
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:27,680
<22-9,Masters>最后剩下的  一个卡迪
<22-9,Masters>and by default, one...Cuddy.

447
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,140
<22-9,Masters>活检的结果是无法确定
<22-9,Masters>Uh...the biopsy was inconclusive.

448
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:35,000
<22-9,Masters>团块位于肾脏中心
<22-9,Masters>The mass is near the center of her kidney.

449
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:36,610
<22-9,Masters>他们没能取到合适的样体
<22-9,Masters>They couldn't get a readable sample.

450
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:40,100
<22-10,House>也就是说必须切除团块
<22-10,House>Means they'll have to remove the mass

451
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:41,710
<22-10,House>才能判断是不是癌症
<22-10,House>to know if it's cancer or not.

452
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:43,030
<22-11,Masters>按照病例的记载
<22-11,Masters>The file says

453
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,330
<22-11,Masters>他们现在正在做影像学检查
<22-11,Masters>they're doing some imaging now,

454
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,350
<22-11,Masters>好让主刀医生对卡迪的情况
<22-11,Masters>give the surgeon a better idea

455
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:46,600
<22-11,Masters>有更充分的了解
<22-11,Masters>of what he's dealing with.

456
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:56,010
<23-1,House>我们可以叫比萨吗
<23-1,House>Can we order pizza?

457
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,810
<23-1,House>冰箱里什么都没有了
<23-1,House>There's nothing in the fridge.

458
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,210
<23-1,House>至少现在什么都没有了
<23-1,House>At least not anymore.

459
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:02,570
<23-1,House>病人怎么样了
<23-1,House>What's happening with the patient?

460
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,030
<23-2,Foreman>血管造影在大脑中动脉
<23-2,Foreman>Angio showed a clot

461
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:07,110
<23-2,Foreman>的一个分支里发现了一个凝血块
<23-2,Foreman>in a branch of his middle cerebral artery.

462
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:09,400
<23-2,Foreman>已经开始给他用链激酶溶栓了
<23-2,Foreman>Started him on streptokinase to break it up.

463
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:13,540
<23-2,Foreman>然而  也许我们应该先玩几轮
<23-2,Foreman>Although...maybe we should have just played a few rounds

464
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,220
<23-2,Foreman>野蛮逃脱2:复仇  这个游戏
<23-2,Foreman>of SavageScape 2: the revenge, because that's obviously

465
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,900
<23-2,Foreman>显然是让某人心情好起来的最佳办法
<23-2,Foreman>the best way to make someone feel better.

466
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:20,860
<23-3,House>再学威尔森  你的脸就再也变不回来了
<23-3,House>You keep talking like Wilson, your face will freeze like that.

467
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,230
<23-4,Foreman>无论你觉得去陪她会有多痛苦
<23-4,Foreman>Look, however bad you think you're gonna be in that room,

468
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:26,160
<23-4,Foreman>不去只会更痛苦
<23-4,Foreman>not being in the room is worse.

469
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,360
<23-4,Foreman>等她跟你分手了
<23-4,Foreman>When she breaks up with you...

470
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:35,920
<23-4,Foreman>才轮到你独自一人打游戏
<23-4,Foreman>you're playing by yourself.

472
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,150
<24-1,Cuddy>亲爱的  我回来了
<24-1,Cuddy>Honey, I'm home.

473
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:45,420
<24-2,House>真准时  焖肉刚刚做好
<24-2,House>Just in time. Pot roast is ready.

474
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:47,090
<24-3,Cuddy>闻起来真香
<24-3,Cuddy>Smells wonderful!

475
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:49,020
<24-4,House>我治好了我所有的病人
<24-4,House>I cured all my patients,

476
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,750
<24-4,House>所以我就下班回家陪瑞秋
<24-4,House>so I came home to spend time with Rachel.

477
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,250
<24-5,Cuddy>你今天过得怎么样
<24-5,Cuddy>And how was your day today?

478
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:54,480
<24-6,Rachel>棒极了  妈妈
<24-6,Rachel>It was great, ma!

479
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,710
<24-6,Rachel>我拼写考试得了满分
<24-6,Rachel>I got 100% on my spelling test

480
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,880
<24-6,Rachel>法学院入学考试考了170分
<24-6,Rachel>and 170 on my LSATs!

481
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,890
<24-7,Cuddy>法学院入学考试  你才八岁呀
<24-7,Cuddy>Your LSATs? You're eight years old.

482
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:03,330
<24-8,House>我们可是一起学习的
<24-8,House>We've been studying together.

483
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,630
<24-8,House>那原本应该是个惊喜
<24-8,House>It was supposed to be a surprise.

484
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:08,190
<24-9,Cuddy>不管怎么样  那真是太好了
<24-9,Cuddy>Well, that's wonderful.

485
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:10,650
<24-10,House>我认为瑞秋
<24-10,House>I think Rachel

486
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:11,890
<24-10,House>应该获得奖赏
<24-10,House>deserves a treat.

487
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,030
<24-11,Rachel>不了  谢谢爸爸
<24-11,Rachel>No, thanks, daddy.

488
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:14,790
<24-11,Rachel>一会儿该吃不下饭了
<24-11,Rachel>It might spoil my appetite.

489
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,710
<24-12,Cuddy>会是谁啊
<24-12,Cuddy>Well, who could that be?

490
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:23,220
<24-13,Wilson>您的蛋糕  豪斯夫人
<24-13,Wilson>Delivery for you, Mrs. House.

491
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:25,800
<24-13,Wilson>29岁生日快乐
<24-13,Wilson>Happy 29th birthday.

492
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,450
<24-14,Cuddy>我才不是29岁呢
<24-14,Cuddy>I'm not 29!

493
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,590
<24-14,Cuddy>你的腿不瘸了
<24-14,Cuddy>You're not limping.

494
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,830
<24-14,Cuddy>不可能啊
<24-14,Cuddy>This isn't possible.

495
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:39,690
<24-14,Cuddy>这一切都不可能
<24-14,Cuddy>None of this is possible.

496
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,540
<24-15,House>有梦就有可能
<24-15,House>Girl can dream.

497
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:54,990
<24-16,Cuddy>你是砂糖用完了吗
<24-16,Cuddy>You run out of sugar?

498
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:58,660
<24-17,Wilson>我拿到了你今天的扫描结果
<24-17,Wilson>Got your scans back from today.

499
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:17,450
<24-17,Wilson>喂
<24-17,Wilson>Yeah.

500
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:28,490
<25-1,House>好的
<25-1,House>Okay.

501
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,290
<25-2,Foreman>怎么了
<25-2,Foreman>What's going on?

502
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:38,750
<25-3,House>片子显示病变的增强显影
<25-3,House>Imaging shows enhancing masses

503
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:41,160
<25-3,House>在卡迪的多个肺叶里扩散
<25-3,House>across multiple lobes of Cuddy's lungs.

504
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:47,610
<25-4,Foreman>那是肾癌转移的表现
<25-4,Foreman>That's what kidney cancer looks like when it metastasizes.

505
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,130
<25-5,House>她没救了
<25-5,House>She's dead.

506
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,790
<26-1,Ryan>怎样  窝囊废
<26-1,Ryan>What's up, losers?

507
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,690
<26-1,Ryan>希望你们还活得自在
<26-1,Ryan>I hope you're enjoying being alive.

508
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:04,600
<26-1,Ryan>今天的课程  自然选择
<26-1,Ryan>Today's lesson: natural selection.

509
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,840
<26-1,Ryan>瑰丽的生态国度  造就了今天的我们
<26-1,Ryan>Excellent system. Made us who we are today.

510
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:09,530
<26-1,Ryan>但我们发明了安全带和便利店
<26-1,Ryan>But then we invented seat belts and grocery stores,

511
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:12,060
<26-1,Ryan>让白痴和废物也能活下来
<26-1,Ryan>things that keep idiots and weaklings alive.

512
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:14,140
<26-2,Ryan>老实说
<26-2,Ryan>And let's be honest.

513
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,000
<26-2,Ryan>你们中的大多数没资格活着
<26-2,Ryan>Most of you don't really deserve it.

514
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,520
<26-3,Ryan>向自然法则致敬
<26-3,Ryan>Here's to the natural order.

515
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,340
<26-3,Ryan>太棒了
<26-3,Ryan>Yes!

516
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:34,510
<26-3,Ryan>从他闪存盘拷过来的
<26-3,Ryan>Copied from his flash drive.

517
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:36,550
<27-1,Taub>我要报警吗
<27-1,Taub>Do I go to the cops?

518
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:39,570
<27-2,Chase>报吧  "警官  我要举报一桩袭击案
<27-2,Chase>Yes. "Officer, I'd like to report an assault.

519
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:41,330
<27-2,Chase>受害者是一堆树叶"
<27-2,Chase>The victim was a pile of leaves."

520
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:42,700
<27-3,Taub>会升级的
<27-3,Taub>It goes on.

521
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,310
<27-3,Taub>他都说想炸了学校
<27-3,Taub>He talks about bombing his school.

522
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:46,610
<27-4,Foreman>你私闯住宅  偷了他的闪存盘
<27-4,Foreman>Which you know because you stole his flash drive

523
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:47,840
<27-4,Foreman>所以你才发现这些
<27-4,Foreman>and broke into his house.

524
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,080
<27-4,Foreman>这出戏你要怎么演
<27-4,Foreman>How's that gonna play?

525
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:51,760
<27-5,Masters>链激酶对瑞安无效
<27-5,Masters>Ryan's not responding to streptokinase.

526
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:53,420
<27-5,Masters>在损伤变得不可修复之前
<27-5,Masters>We don't have very long before the damage

527
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,020
<27-5,Masters>我们没多少时间了
<27-5,Masters>becomes irreversible.

528
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,650
<27-6,Chase>我们要么加大用药剂量
<27-6,Chase>So we either up his dosage

529
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:58,610
<27-6,Chase>要么就到他脑袋里取出血栓
<27-6,Chase>or go into his head and get the clot out.

530
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:00,450
<27-7,Foreman>-豪斯人呢  -但愿他和卡迪在一起
<27-7,Foreman>- Where's House? - Hopefully with Cuddy.

531
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:02,340
<27-7,Foreman>她刚得知些不幸的消息
<27-7,Foreman>She did just get some pretty awful news.

532
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:02,930
<27-8,Masters>我打电话问过了
<27-8,Masters>I called her.

533
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:04,400
<27-8,Masters>她也不知道他在哪里
<27-8,Masters>She doesn't know where he is either.

534
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,910
<28-1,Foreman>见过豪斯吗
<28-1,Foreman>Have you seen House?

535
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,190
<28-2,Wilson>没有
<28-2,Wilson>No.

536
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,250
<28-3,Foreman>昨晚接完你电话  他就离开我家了
<28-3,Foreman>He left my place last night after you called.

537
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:20,680
<28-3,Foreman>今天没人见过他
<28-3,Foreman>No one's seen him today.

538
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,030
<28-3,Foreman>知道他可能去哪里吗
<28-3,Foreman>Any idea where he'd be?

539
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:24,260
<28-4,Wilson>不知道
<28-4,Wilson>No.

540
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,610
<28-5,Foreman>你都  不担心他吗
<28-5,Foreman>And you're not... worried about that?

541
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:30,110
<28-5,Foreman>他不善于处理坏消息
<28-5,Foreman>He's not good with bad news.

542
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:32,650
<28-6,Wilson>不  我担心
<28-6,Wilson>Yes. I'm worried.

543
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:34,920
<28-6,Wilson>但现在豪斯不是重点  卡迪才是
<28-6,Wilson>But this isn't about House. It's about Cuddy.

544
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:36,250
<28-6,Wilson>她才是有可能会死的那个
<28-6,Wilson>She's the one who could be dying,

545
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:38,010
<28-6,Wilson>而他又想把自己变成主角
<28-6,Wilson>and he's trying to make this about himself.

546
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:39,530
<28-6,Wilson>我不打算陪他玩
<28-6,Wilson>I'm not playing.

547
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,000
<28-7,Foreman>好吧
<28-7,Foreman>Okay...

548
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:45,900
<28-8,Wilson>她仍相信他会出现
<28-8,Wilson>She still believes he'll show up.

549
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:49,990
<28-8,Wilson>他要么自己想通
<28-8,Wilson>He'll either get over himself

550
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:51,930
<28-8,Wilson>回来扮演好为人男友的角色
<28-8,Wilson>and be who she needs him to be

551
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,850
<28-8,Wilson>要么继续逃避
<28-8,Wilson>or he won't.

552
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,410
<29-1,Taub>我们想做个血栓清除术
<29-1,Taub>We'd like to do an embolectomy.

553
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:02,460
<29-1,Taub>用螺旋形导丝沿血管进入瑞安的大脑中动脉
<29-1,Taub>We'll run a corkscrew-shaped instrument into Ryan's brain

554
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,850
<29-1,Taub>取出血栓
<29-1,Taub>and pull the clot out.

555
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,440
<29-1,Taub>好吧
<29-1,Taub>Okay.

556
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,510
<29-2,Kay>你们和他谈过了吗
<29-2,Kay>Have you talked to him about it?

557
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:11,470
<29-3,Taub>是的  但我想和你们单独谈谈
<29-3,Taub>Yes. But I wanted to see you alone.

558
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:14,850
<29-3,Taub>我看了些瑞安几周前拍的视频
<29-3,Taub>I saw some vides that Ryan made a few weeks ago.

559
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,890
<29-3,Taub>片中他在引爆炸药管
<29-3,Taub>He's blowing up pipe bombs

560
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:19,430
<29-3,Taub>恐吓他学校的人
<29-3,Taub>and threatening people in his school.

561
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:20,190
<29-4,Kay>哦  天啊
<29-4,Kay>Oh, god!

562
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:21,670
<29-5,Todd>他可能只是瞎捣蛋
<29-5,Todd>He was probably just messing around.

563
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:22,900
<29-5,Todd>我儿子不会伤害任何人的
<29-5,Todd>Our son wouldn't hurt anybody.

564
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,130
<29-6,Taub>我不那么确定
<29-6,Taub>I'm not so sure.

565
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:25,650
<29-7,Kay>我知道这看起来很糟
<29-7,Kay>I know this looks bad,

566
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:27,650
<29-7,Kay>不过瑞安是好孩子
<29-7,Kay>but Ryan's a good kid.

567
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:29,150
<29-7,Kay>进高中后的这两年
<29-7,Kay>He's had a rough couple years

568
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:30,310
<29-7,Kay>他是过得不好
<29-7,Kay>since he started high school,

569
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:32,190
<29-7,Kay>不过我真的相信他会缓过来
<29-7,Kay>but I really think he'll come out of it.

570
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:33,820
<29-8,Taub>-他需要帮助  -也许是
<29-8,Taub>- He needs help. - Maybe he does,

571
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,380
<29-9,Todd>但这要是传出去  他会被停学
<29-9,Todd>but if this gets out, he'll be suspended,

572
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:36,480
<29-9,Todd>也许被开除
<29-9,Todd>maybe expelled.

573
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:38,400
<29-9,Todd>你能不能先专注于救他的命
<29-9,Todd>How about you focus on keeping him alive?

574
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,210
<30-1,Masters>你会怎么做
<30-1,Masters>What are you gonna do?

575
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:43,900
<30-2,Taub>你觉得我该怎么做
<30-2,Taub>What do you think I should do?

576
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,450
<30-3,Masters>切  哼
<30-3,Masters>Pssh. Ha.

577
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:46,780
<30-3,Masters>我说出来  你好唱反调么
<30-3,Masters>So you can do the opposite?

578
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:49,530
<30-3,Masters>全国上下许多小孩都在做
<30-3,Masters>There are kids all over the country

579
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:51,620
<30-3,Masters>愚蠢至极  有暴力倾向的事
<30-3,Masters>doing dumb, potentially violent things,

580
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:54,250
<30-3,Masters>可真正演变为犯罪杀人的
<30-3,Masters>but the percentage of them who would actually kill anybody

581
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,590
<30-3,Masters>却没几个
<30-3,Masters>is miniscule.

582
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:56,860
<30-4,Taub>所以我该置若罔闻
<30-4,Taub>So I shouldn't do anything.

583
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:59,080
<30-5,Masters>呃  虽然几率很低
<30-5,Masters>Mm...while the odds are low,

584
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,980
<30-5,Masters>一旦放虎归山  可能  后患无穷
<30-5,Masters>the fallout could be... huge.

585
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:04,420
<30-5,Masters>伤及数十甚至数百条生命
<30-5,Masters>Tens or even hundreds of lives.

586
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:05,730
<30-6,Taub>所以我该报警检举
<30-6,Taub>So I should call the cops.

587
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:08,280
<30-7,Masters>当然  过分纠结于给这事定性
<30-7,Masters>Of course, over-identification with the subject

588
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:11,810
<30-7,Masters>容易歪曲计算结果  朝未雨绸缪的方向发展
<30-7,Masters>could skew the calculation towards being extra-protective.

589
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,670
<30-7,Masters>又或者
<30-7,Masters>Or alternatively--

590
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:15,260
<30-8,Taub>你说的全是废话
<30-8,Taub>You suck at this.

591
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,300
<30-9,Masters>应该怪统计学
<30-9,Masters>Hate the statistics...

592
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:23,320
<30-9,Masters>别迁怒统计员
<30-9,Masters>Not the statistician.

593
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:29,710
<31-1,Foreman>再加点显影剂
<31-1,Foreman>Give me a little more dye.

594
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:34,560
<31-2,Chase>血栓在这
<31-2,Chase>There's the clot.

595
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,360
<31-2,Chase>你刚碰到  它就溶解了
<31-2,Chase>It just disintegrated when you touched it.

596
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:44,480
<31-3,Foreman>那是什么东西
<31-3,Foreman>What was that thing?

598
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:59,880
<32-1,House>我想到个绝佳去处
<32-1,House>I got a great idea where we should go.

599
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,010
<32-2,Cuddy>我不想听
<32-2,Cuddy>I don't want to hear it.

600
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:02,010
<32-3,House>你会喜欢的
<32-3,House>You're gonna love it.

601
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:05,270
<32-3,House>去澳大利亚最好
<32-3,House>Australia's finest.

602
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:07,250
<32-3,House>纽瓦克有个超赞的卡拉OK酒吧
<32-3,House>There's a great karaoke bar in Newark--

603
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:09,380
<32-4,Cuddy>我讨厌卡拉OK
<32-4,Cuddy>I hate karaoke.

604
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:13,290
<32-5,House>他们有所有澳洲歌手
<32-5,House>They got every-- every song

605
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:14,910
<32-5,House>的所有  每一首歌曲
<32-5,House>by every Aussie artist.

<32-6,Cuddy>我物理可不行[指牛顿]
<32-6,Cuddy>I do a mean version of physical.

610
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:23,680
<32-7,House>而且烤虾棒极了
<32-7,House>And the barbecue shrimp is amazing.

611
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:28,150
<32-8,Cuddy>薯条怎么样
<32-8,Cuddy>What about the fries?

612
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:30,530
<32-9,House>味美香咸
<32-9,House>Hot and salty and delicious.

613
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:42,110
<32-9,House>一谈论食物我就饿了
<32-9,House>Talking about food made me hungry.

614
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:45,410
<32-10,Cuddy>在我其它的梦里你吃的是糖
<32-10,Cuddy>You had candy in my other dreams.

615
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,170
<32-11,House>说明你工作压力太大了
<32-11,House>Means you're stressed at work.

616
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,590
<32-11,House>所有的梦境都意味着你工作压力太大了
<32-11,House>All dream symbols mean you're stressed at work.

617
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,410
<32-11,House>要不就是阉割焦虑症
<32-11,House>Or castration anxiety.

618
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:54,980
<32-11,House>得了吧
<32-11,House>No.

619
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:57,260
<32-12,Cuddy>我还指望
<32-12,Cuddy>I was hoping...

620
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,350
<32-12,Cuddy>你能想出个办法来应对现在的情况
<32-12,Cuddy>You'd figure out a way to handle all this.

621
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:05,860
<32-12,Cuddy>或许你根本不能  因为你还是那么孩子气
<32-12,Cuddy>Maybe you can't because you're still a child.

622
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,920
<32-13,House>我能做得更好
<32-13,House>I can do better.

623
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,870
<32-14,Cuddy>也许为时已晚了
<32-14,Cuddy>Might be too late.

624
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:27,370
<33-1,Cuddy>豪斯
<33-1,Cuddy>House!

625
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,880
<33-2,House>我早该过来陪你的

626
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:00,750
<33-2,House>抱歉
<33-2,House>Sorry.

627
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:08,670
<33-3,Cuddy>我知道你会来的
<33-3,Cuddy>I knew you'd come.

628
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:16,780
<33-3,Cuddy>那到底是什么东西
<33-3,Cuddy>What was that thing,

629
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:20,050
<34-1,Taub>为什么它会在手术中途溶解了呢
<34-1,Taub>and why did it just dissolve in the middle of surgery?

630
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:21,570
<34-2,Foreman>为什么他的肝脏正要停止工作呢
<34-2,Foreman>Why is his liver shutting down?

631
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:22,760
<34-2,Foreman>他脑袋里的那个东西消失了
<34-2,Foreman>That thing in his brain goes away,

632
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:23,950
<34-2,Foreman>那小孩却陷入了昏迷
<34-2,Foreman>the kid slips into a coma.

633
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:25,600
<34-3,Masters>我们可以用乳果糖来治疗
<34-3,Masters>We started him on Lactulose,

634
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,720
<34-3,Masters>但是从他肝功能下降的速度来看
<34-3,Masters>but at the rate his liver function is declining,

635
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,050
<34-3,Masters>他只能活一天了
<34-3,Masters>he'll be dead in a day.

636
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:30,970
<34-3,Masters>我们要呼豪斯吗
<34-3,Masters>Should we page House?

637
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:32,630
<34-4,Chase>他正忙着呢
<34-4,Chase>He's busy.

638
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:39,290
<34-5,Masters>豪斯帮不上她一星半点的忙
<34-5,Masters>House can't do anything for her now.

639
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:41,310
<34-5,Masters>我们需要他  按他的逻辑
<34-5,Masters>We need him! By his own logic--

640
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:43,230
<34-6,Chase>病人的巴比妥和对乙酰氨基酚血检结果
<34-6,Chase>Patient's blood tests were negative

641
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:44,760
<34-6,Chase>都呈阴性
<34-6,Chase>for Barbiturates or Acetaminophen.

642
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,690
<34-6,Chase>他没有采用高蛋白节食法
<34-6,Chase>He's not on a high protein diet.

643
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,620
<35-1,Chase>豪斯在她奄奄一息之前就已经
<35-1,Chase>House couldn't concentrate on the case

644
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:49,490
<35-1,Chase>无法集中精神在这病例上了
<35-1,Chase>before she was dying.

645
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:51,170
<35-1,Chase>你觉得他现在就能关注这个病例了吗
<35-1,Chase>You think he's gonna get in the game now?

646
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,030
<35-2,House>要是你没撑下来
<35-2,House>If you don't make it,

647
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:56,850
<35-2,House>我保证至少一个月不和别人睡
<35-2,House>I won't sleep with anyone for at least a month.

648
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:57,840
<35-3,Cuddy>两个月吧
<35-3,Cuddy>Make it two.

649
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,150
<35-4,House>臭婆娘
<35-4,House>Bitch.

650
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:05,510
<35-4,House>急性间歇性血卟啉病会导致尿毒症
<35-4,House>A.I.P. can cause uremia,

651
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,220
<36-1,Masters>增加肝脏负担
<36-1,Masters>tank the liver.

652
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:08,550
<36-2,Chase>那会导致腹部痉挛  而不是腹部出血
<36-2,Chase>It causes abdominal cramping, not abdominal bleeding.

653
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:10,810
<36-3,Masters>那岩藻糖苷病就对了吗
<36-3,Masters>Oh, because fucosidosis was such a brilliant idea?

654
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:11,850
<36-4,Taub>同志们
<36-4,Taub>Guys!

655

<36-5,Chase>Type 2 citrullinemia fits.

656
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:18,990
<36-6,Masters>但没有高脂血症和
<36-6,Masters>There are no signs of hyperlipidemia

657
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:20,280
<36-6,Masters>胰腺炎的迹象
<36-6,Masters>or pancreatitis.

658
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,640
<36-7,Taub>这两项症状会潜伏很多年才发作
<36-7,Taub>Those can take years to emerge.

659
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:23,010
<36-8,Foreman>这是我们得出的最靠谱的结果
<36-8,Foreman>Closest we've gotten.

660
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:24,930
<36-8,Foreman>开始用四型苯甲酸钠治疗
<36-8,Foreman>Start him on IV Sodium Benzoate.

<38-8,House>Once they ruled out cancer,

729
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:15,300
<38-8,House>我想起你妈抗生素过敏的事
<38-8,House>I remembered that your mom was allergic to antibiotics.

730
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,740
<38-8,House>就让他们给你验血
<38-8,House>So I had them test your blood,

731
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,950
<38-8,House>你的免疫球蛋白E都高到天上去了
<38-8,House>and your IgE levels were through the roof.

732
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:21,450
<38-8,House>肺部团块是过敏反应
<38-8,House>Because the lung masses were an allergic reaction.

733
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:23,340
<38-8,House>所以你一经停用抗生素
<38-8,House>So now you're off the antibiotics,

734
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,350
<38-8,House>肺应该会很快好起来
<38-8,House>your lungs should clear right up.

735
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:31,900
<38-8,House>我给你带了东西
<38-8,House>I brought you something.

736
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:35,280
<38-8,House>来跟你的肿瘤打个招呼
<38-8,House>Say hello to your tumor.

737
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:37,490
<38-8,House>等下
<38-8,House>Wait.

738
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,950
<38-9,Cuddy>我心里有很多事足以令我恐慌
<38-9,Cuddy>There are so many things that I could be afraid of,

739
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:51,690
<38-9,Cuddy>多数时候
<38-9,Cuddy>and most of the time,

740
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:55,370
<38-9,Cuddy>我能用重重屏障封住那些恐惧
<38-9,Cuddy>I manage to lock them up behind doors.

741
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,520
<38-9,Cuddy>可是我这一病
<38-9,Cuddy>But this happens

742
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:02,970
<38-9,Cuddy>所有屏障都崩坏了
<38-9,Cuddy>all those doors just burst open.

743
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:13,350
<38-9,Cuddy>又突然找到
<38-9,Cuddy>You just figured something out

744
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:14,810
<38-9,Cuddy>诊断灵感了是不是
<38-9,Cuddy>about your patient, didn't you?

745
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:18,550
<38-9,Cuddy>去吧  做你该做的
<38-9,Cuddy>Go. Do what you do.

746
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,570
<39-1,House>给他停药
<39-1,House>Take him off the meds.

747
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:27,990
<39-1,House>他是葡萄球菌感染
<39-1,House>He's got a staph infection.

748
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:29,980
<39-2,Kay>三天前你们给他治疗过葡萄球菌感染
<39-2,Kay>You treated him for staph three days ago.

749
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:30,660
<39-2,Kay>没有作用
<39-2,Kay>It didn't work.

750
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:33,440
<39-3,House>他体内已有的细菌起了反应
<39-3,House>Bacteria already in his system responded.

751
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,340
<39-3,House>一道屏障被击破  道道崩溃
<39-3,House>Once a door's been busted open, more just keep coming.

752
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:39,820
<39-4,Masters>他说的是脓肿
<39-4,Masters>Oh! He's talking about an abscess.

753
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,110
<39-5,Taub>我听得懂
<39-5,Taub>I got that.

754
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:42,920
<39-6,House>对乘虚而入者而言
<39-6,House>For the cheap seats,

755
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:46,500
<39-6,House>脓肿就是感染的奶油泡芙
<39-6,House>an abscess is a gooey little cream puff of infection.

756
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,680
<39-6,House>很可能就是在你的傲慢和
<39-6,House>Probably burst when your little pride

757
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:51,200
<39-6,House>杀人乐趣爆发时崩溃的
<39-6,House>and homicidal joy took a hard foul.

758
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:53,100
<39-7,Taub>这是好消息
<39-7,Taub>It's good news.

759
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,360
<39-8,Masters>前提是我们找到那道屏障
<39-8,Masters>If we can find the door.

760
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,070
<39-7,Taub>我想我找到了
<39-7,Taub>I think I know where it is.

761
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:05,640
<39-5,Taub>如果这些伤不是玩滑板摔的呢
<39-5,Taub>What if... these aren't from skateboarding?

762
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:09,760
<39-4,Masters>这孩子玩过PVC炸药管
<39-4,Masters>The kid has been blowing up PVC pipe bombs.

763
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,170
<39-2,Kay>如果炸弹碎片击中他
<39-2,Kay>If he got hit by shrapnel,

764
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:13,350
<39-1,House>身体会将异物包裹起来
<39-1,House>the body walls off the foreign object,

765
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,690
<39-1,House>因为这些异物是塑料材质
<39-1,House>which, because it's plastic,

766
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:15,830
<39-1,House>造影显示不出来
<39-1,House>doesn't show up on imaging

767
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:17,890
<39-1,House>于是为细菌滋生提供了温床
<39-1,House>and provides a perfect home for bacteria.

768
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:20,120
<39-1,House>抗生素攻击感染部位
<39-1,House>Antibiotics attacked the infection,

769
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,520
<39-1,House>炸弹碎片破裂开来
<39-1,House>causing pieces to break off.

770
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,830
<36-1,Masters>其中一些袭击了肝脏
<36-1,Masters>Some hit the liver.

771
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:24,780
<34-2,Foreman>有一片停留在脑部
<34-2,Foreman>One lodged in his brain and dissolved

772
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,010
<34-2,Foreman>被福曼碰到的时候消解了
<34-2,Foreman>when Foreman touched it.

773
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:28,350
<34-2,Foreman>切开脓肿取出碎片
<34-2,Foreman>Once we drain the abscess and remove the shrapnel,

774
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:30,090
<34-2,Foreman>抗生素就会起作用
<34-2,Foreman>the antibiotics can do their job.

775
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:31,650
<34-2,Foreman>他会好起来的
<34-2,Foreman>He'll be fine.

776
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:36,850
<41-1,Julia>现在的问题只剩  你要怎么做呢
<41-1,Julia>Which just leaves... What are you gonna do now?

777
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:44,810
<41-2,Cuddy>余下的汤我放冰箱里了
<41-2,Cuddy>I put the rest of the soup in the freezer

778
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:46,850
<41-3,Julia>留给你下顿吃
<41-3,Julia>so you'll have some for later.

779
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:49,920
<41-4,Julia>-谢谢你照顾我  -不客气
<41-4,Julia>- Thanks for everything. - Yeah.

780
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:52,790
<41-5,Cuddy>-来  -我能行
<41-5,Cuddy>- Here you go. - I got it.

781
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:56,910
<41-6,Julia>你会告诉咱妈吗
<41-6,Julia>Are you gonna tell mom?

782
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:59,430
<41-7,Cuddy>好让她赶来以她独特的方式照顾你
<41-7,Cuddy>So she can show up here to take care of you

783
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:01,870
<41-8,Julia>把你的保姆骂得狗血淋头
<41-8,Julia>by harassing the housekeeper

784
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:03,360
<41-8,Julia>浴袍贬得一文不值
<41-8,Julia>and criticizing your bathrobe?

785
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:05,780
<41-8,Julia>算了吧  我看还是过几年再说
<41-8,Julia>Yeah. I think I'm gonna wait a few years.

786
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:12,750
<41-8,Julia>还有  安全起见
<41-8,Julia>Oh, and I moved your sleeping pills back

787
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:15,500
<41-8,Julia>我把你的安眠药放回药橱里了
<41-8,Julia>in the medicine cabinet because I just worry.

788
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,350
<41-8,Julia>瑞秋总说药片是糖
<41-8,Julia>Rachel always calls them candy.

789
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:29,810
<42-1,Cuddy>你吃了维科丁
<42-1,Cuddy>You took vicodin.

790
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:36,100
<42-1,Cuddy>那晚你来我病房的时候
<42-1,Cuddy>When you came to my hospital room that night,

791
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:38,270
<42-1,Cuddy>正飘飘然呢
<42-1,Cuddy>you were stoned.

792
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:50,820
<42-2,House>你怎么知道的
<42-2,House>How did you know?

793
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:56,690
<42-3,Cuddy>我怎么会不知道
<42-3,Cuddy>How did I not know?

794
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:00,320
<42-3,Cuddy>我怎么能自欺欺人数月之久
<42-3,Cuddy>How did I make myself forget for months

795
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,530
<42-3,Cuddy>忘记你是瘾君子
<42-3,Cuddy>that you're an addict?

796
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:06,130
<42-3,Cuddy>原来我的潜意识一直在试图提醒我
<42-3,Cuddy>My subconscious was trying to tell me

797
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:08,170
<42-3,Cuddy>你不依靠药物是不可能挺得过这件事的
<42-3,Cuddy>you could never get through this without drugs.

798
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,050
<42-4,House>我只吃这一次
<42-4,House>It was a one-time thing.

799
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:16,070
<42-5,Cuddy>豪斯  这与药物无关
<42-5,Cuddy>It's not about the pills, House.

800
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:17,730
<42-5,Cuddy>而是这背后的意义
<42-5,Cuddy>It's about what they mean.

801
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:20,340
<42-6,House>我当时很害怕
<42-6,House>I was scared because I thought

802
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:22,260
<42-6,House>因为我以为我女朋友会死
<42-6,House>my girlfriend might die.

803
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:23,270
<42-6,House>不
<42-6,House>No.

804
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:26,080
<42-7,Cuddy>你吃维科丁不是因为恐惧
<42-7,Cuddy>You don't take vicodin because you're scared.

805
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:28,560
<42-7,Cuddy>你吃维科丁是为了逃避痛苦
<42-7,Cuddy>You take it so you won't feel pain.

806
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,890
<42-7,Cuddy>你所做过的一切都是为了逃避痛苦
<42-7,Cuddy>Everything you've ever done is to avoid pain...

807
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:32,670
<42-7,Cuddy>你依赖药物  愤世嫉俗
<42-7,Cuddy>Drugs, sarcasm...

808
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,610
<42-7,Cuddy>与所有人保持一臂之遥
<42-7,Cuddy>keeping everybody at arm's length

809
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:35,580
<42-7,Cuddy>因为这样就没人能伤到你
<42-7,Cuddy>so no one can hurt you.

810
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:37,190
<42-8,House>与世界上其他人汲汲寻觅痛苦
<42-8,House>As opposed to everyone else in the world

811
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:39,720
<42-8,House>如同寻宝形成鲜明对比吗
<42-8,House>who goes looking for pain like it's buried treasure?

812
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:44,900
<42-9,Cuddy>有爱即有忧
<42-9,Cuddy>Pain happens when you care.

813
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:48,740
<42-9,Cuddy>要爱一个人
<42-9,Cuddy>Y... you can't love someone

814
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:54,780
<42-9,Cuddy>就要会面对对方的烦恼和恐惧
<42-9,Cuddy>without making yourself open to their problems, their fears.

815
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:57,510
<42-9,Cuddy>而这些正是你不愿意做的
<42-9,Cuddy>And you're not willing to do that.

816
00:40:57,510 --> 00:41:00,010
<42-10,House>我  我是去陪你的
<42-10,House>I ca... I came to be with you.

817
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:02,320
<42-11,Cuddy>可你没在我身边  那不是真实的你
<42-11,Cuddy>But you weren't with me, not really.

818
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:06,470
<42-12,House>我想陪你的
<42-12,House>I wanted to be.

819
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:11,460
<42-13,Cuddy>只想是不够的
<42-13,Cuddy>That's not enough.

820
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:18,440
<42-14,House>我可以改
<42-14,House>I can do better.

821
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:25,790
<42-15,Cuddy>我觉得你改不了
<42-15,Cuddy>I don't think you can.

822
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:32,960
<42-15,Cuddy>你会一而再再而三地
<42-15,Cuddy>You'll choose yourself over everybody else

823
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,590
<42-15,Cuddy>选择自己  舍弃他人
<42-15,Cuddy>over and over again,

824
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:36,360
<42-15,Cuddy>因为你生而如此
<42-15,Cuddy>because that's just who you are.

825
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:46,650
<42-15,Cuddy>对不起
<42-15,Cuddy>I'm sorry.

826
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:49,140
<42-16,House>不  不不不  别这样  不要这样
<42-16,House>No. No, no, no. Don't. Don't.

827
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,300
<42-17,Cuddy>我以为我可以的
<42-17,Cuddy>I thought I could do this.

828
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,910
<42-18,House>求你不要这样
<42-18,House>Don't. Please don't.

829
00:41:57,990 --> 00:41:59,210
<42-19,Cuddy>再见  豪斯
<42-19,Cuddy>Good-bye, House.
