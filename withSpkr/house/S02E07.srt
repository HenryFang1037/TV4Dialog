1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,000
<1-1,Wilson>我不打算帮你，你可以走路上班
<1-1,Wilson>My office is withdrawn. You can walk to work.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
<1-2,House>明白了，你极度愤怒
<1-2,House>Got it, you're morally outraged.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
<1-2,House>我们一起把这部分了结了行吗?
<1-2,House>Now, can we get through this part?

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,500
<1-2,House>因为下一部分才真正令人生畏呢
<1-2,House>'Cause the next part's awesome.

5
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,500
<1-3,Wilson>你怎么能把这样的事合理化呢?
<1-3,Wilson>How do you rationalize something like this?

6
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,000
<1-3,Wilson>你闯进了史黛西心理心理医生的办公室
<1-3,Wilson>You broke into Stacy's therapist's office.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,900
<1-4,House>借了把钥匙
<1-4,House>Borrowed a key.

8
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,000
<1-5,Wilson>还偷了她的治疗记录
<1-5,Wilson>And stole her treatment notes.

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
<1-6,House>不，我复印了
<1-6,House>Nope, I made copies.

10
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,500
<1-6,House>马克是，我引述
<1-6,House>Mark is, and I quote

11
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,600
<1-6,House>性格孤僻，被动而有侵犯性,拒绝交流
<1-6,House>"withdrawn, passive/aggressive, won't communicate.

12
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,000
<1-6,House>就象他恨我能走路那样怨恨我
<1-6,House>Like he resents me because I can walk."

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
<1-7,Wilson>我不想听这些
<1-7,Wilson>I don't wanna hear this.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,800
<1-8,House>"盘子在水槽里，如厕掀起厕板
<1-8,House>"Dishes in the sink, toilet seat up.

15
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,300
<1-8,House>同时，她无法抑制地想……
<1-8,House>Meanwhile, she can't stop thinking about..."

16
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,700
<1-8,House>我不能读这段
<1-8,House>I can't read that.

17
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,700
<1-8,House>她是否被匹灰马所迷惑?
<1-8,House>Is she obsessed with a gray horse?

18
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:35,700
<1-8,House>还是我？
<1-8,House>Or me?

19
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,500
<1-9,Wilson>这里说她认为你是一个令人气恼的混蛋
<1-9,Wilson>It says she thinks you're an annoying jerk.

20
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,500
<1-10,House>那是爱称
<1-10,House>It's a pet name.

21
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,600
<1-10,House>惊人的部分在这里
<1-10,House>Here's the kicker.

22
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,800
<1-11,Wilson>他们没有性生活?
<1-11,Wilson>They're not having sex?

23
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,400
<2-1,House>医生清除了他，但没有发射
<2-1,House>Doctor cleared him, but no lift off.

24
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,200
<2-1,House>她有挫败感，所以她折磨我
<2-1,House>She's frustrated, so she's doc-blocking me.

25
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,500
<2-1,House>文字工作，研讨会,搅和我的病人
<2-1,House>Paperwork, seminars, meddling with my patients.

26
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,700
<2-2,Wilson>现在你有了你需要的证据
<2-2,Wilson>And now you've got the proof you need.

27
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,100
<2-2,Wilson>干脆把这些私人的心理治疗记录,拿给卡迪
<2-2,Wilson>Just take those personal psyche records to Cuddy.

28
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,200
<2-2,Wilson>证明史黛西失控了
<2-2,Wilson>That'll show her Stacy is out of control.

29
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,300
<2-2,Wilson>你不理我吗?
<2-2,Wilson>You ignoring me?

30
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,500
<2-3,House>我在找我的报纸
<2-3,House>While looking for my newspaper.

31
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,800
<2-3,House>有效吧?
<2-3,House>Efficient, huh?

32
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,500
<2-4,Kalvin>这里
<2-4,Kalvin>Over here.

33
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,700
<2-5,House>韦医生，来见见我的高人
<2-5,House>Dr. Wilson, I want you to meet my stalker.

34
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,800
<2-6,Kalvin>你的休息室差劲透了
<2-6,Kalvin>Your waiting room sucks.

35
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,300
<2-7,House>我可没给你做治疗
<2-7,House>I am not treating you.

36
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,300
<2-8,Kalvin>因为储藏室事件吗?
<2-8,Kalvin>Because you're a closet case?

37
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:28,300
<2-9,Wilson>我们，不是一对
<2-9,Wilson>We're not, uh, together.

38
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,100
<2-10,House>他十分自毁
<2-10,House>He is so self-loathing.

39
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,600
<2-10,House>我们得走了，那就下班后见吧
<2-10,House>Well, we've gotta go now. So maybe see you after work.

40
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,500
<2-10,House>不，不
<2-10,House>No, no, no.

41
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,400
<2-11,Kalvin>没人能搞清楚我的问题
<2-11,Kalvin>Nobody can figure out what's wrong with me.

42
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,300
<2-12,House>你衬衫的领子懈了
<2-12,House>Well, your shirt is gaping at the collar.

43
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,200
<2-12,House>意思是你体重减了
<2-12,House>Means you've lost weight.

44
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,300
<2-12,House>你脸红，所以发烧,而且呼吸急促
<2-12,House>You're flushed, that's fever. And you're short of breath.

45
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,100
<2-12,House>同时你的脸上终于有了损伤痕迹
<2-12,House>And finally, there's the KS lesion on your face.

46
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,700
<2-12,House>意思是你HIV阳性,进一步证明你是艾滋病晚期
<2-12,House>Means you're HIV positive, progressed to full-blown aids.

47
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,200
<2-12,House>所以，你病了，免疫系统问题
<2-12,House>So, you're sick because your immune system

48
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,100
<2-12,House>而且还有人朝你打喷嚏
<2-12,House>is shot and some one sneezed on you.

49
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,200
<2-12,House>这下我可以走了吗？
<2-12,House>Can I be excused now?

50
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,300
<2-13,Kalvin>出色，但是我的免疫系统没问题
<2-13,Kalvin>Brilliant, but my immune system is fine.

51
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,600
<2-14,House>你的集中营体格乞求不同
<2-14,House>Your concentration camp physique begs to differ.

52
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,200
<2-14,House>拿你的T细胞读数再检查
<2-14,House>Get your t-cell count rechecked.

53
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,600
<2-15,Kalvin>我已经那么做了
<2-15,Kalvin>I've already done that.

54
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,600
<2-16,Wilson>他们做过淋巴瘤T细胞检查吗？
<2-16,Wilson>They test for t-celllymphoma?

55
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,000
<2-17,Kalvin>是阴性的
<2-17,Kalvin>It was negative.

56
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,900
<2-18,House>这些症状会非常吸引艾滋病专家的
<2-18,House>All of this would be fascinating to an HIV specialist.

57
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,600
<2-18,House>现在在我手杖变成你新男友之前,把我的手杖放开
<2-18,House>Now let go of my cane before,it becomes your new boyfriend.

58
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,400
<2-19,Kalvin>甜心，如果你肯看我的病例,我可以跟它结婚
<2-19,Kalvin>Honey, I will marry it if you will look at my file.

59
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,000
<2-20,House>议会不允许，所以...
<2-20,House>Congress says you can't, so...

60
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,300
<2-21,House>我都没碰他
<2-21,House>I didn't touch him.

61
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,300
<2-22,Wilson>他发过敏性休克了
<2-22,Wilson>He's going into anaphylactic shock.

64
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,900
<3-1,Cuddy>去见史黛西
<3-1,Cuddy>Go see Stacy.

65
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,700
<3-2,House>我们给了他epi, 他没事
<3-2,House>We gave him an epi, he's fine.

66
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,100
<3-3,Cuddy>你需要律师，去见史黛西
<3-3,Cuddy>You need a lawyer, go see Stacy.

67
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,200
<3-3,Cuddy>你打了个病人
<3-3,Cuddy>You hit a patient.

68
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,900
<3-4,House>四个字，两个错
<3-4,House>Four words, two mistakes.

69
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,600
<3-4,House>他不是病人，我也没打他
<3-4,House>He's not a patient, and I didn't hit him.

70
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,300
<3-5,Cuddy>你当然没打，去见史黛西
<3-5,Cuddy>Of course you didn't. Go see Stacy.

71
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,400
<3-6,House>我不导致过敏性反应
<3-6,House>I didn't cause the anaphylaxis.

72
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,900
<3-6,House>没准是他HIV治疗的副作用……
<3-6,House>It's probably one of his HIV meds--avacavir...

73
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:27,900
<3-7,Cuddy>我预料到了
<3-7,Cuddy>I'll pass that along.

74
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,600
<3-7,Cuddy>确保急诊室能一并解决,去见史黛西
<3-7,Cuddy>Make sure the ER takes him off it. Go see Stacy.

75
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,400
<4-1,Stacy>你得给他做治疗
<4-1,Stacy>You have to treat him.

76
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,000
<4-2,House>医学上讲，这个案例简直小儿科
<4-2,House>Medically, this case is a snooze fest.

77
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,300
<4-2,House>艾滋病加感染
<4-2,House>Aids plus infection.

78
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,300
<4-3,Stacy>你不管他，他就以袭击控告你
<4-3,Stacy>You don't treat him, he charges you with assault.

79
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,000
<4-4,House>我不会因为他说我攻击他,就得按事实处置
<4-4,House>Just 'cause he says I hit him, doesn't make it true.

80
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,900
<4-4,House>看啊，我被裸体拉拉队员包围……
<4-4,House>Watch. I am surrounded by naked cheer leaders.

81
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,400
<4-4,House>看见了?
<4-4,House>See?

82
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,400
<4-4,House>尽管我今早喜欢来点体力活
<4-4,House>Although I like my chances of some action this morning.

83
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,400
<4-5,Stacy>我忘了周三是妓女日,这个可以等等再说
<4-5,Stacy>I forgot Wednesday was hooker day.,This could have waited.

84
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,700
<4-6,House>你迫使我到你家跟你见面
<4-6,House>You make me meet you at your house.

85
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,700
<4-6,House>你丈夫很方便的不在家
<4-6,House>Your husband is conveniently absent.

86
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,400
<4-7,Stacy>马克在做理疗
<4-7,Stacy>Mark's at physio.

87
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,400
<4-7,Stacy>我在等杀虫的人来走不了
<4-7,Stacy>I'm stuck waiting for the exterminator.

88
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,900
<4-7,Stacy>我昨晚看见一只老鼠
<4-7,Stacy>I saw a rat last night.

89
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,900
<4-8,House>我很惊讶你的脚还踩着地
<4-8,House>Well, I'm surprised your feet are touching the floor.

90
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,400
<4-9,Stacy>我都睡不着觉
<4-9,Stacy>I barely slept.

91
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,700
<4-10,House>马克干嘛来着?
<4-10,House>What was Mark up to?

92
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,600
<4-10,House>记忆里，最快爬上格里高山峰
<4-10,House>Memory serves, a quick climb up Mt. Gregory

93
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,300
<4-10,House>而你在打海豹的时候睡着了
<4-10,House>and you'd doze through a seal hunt.

94
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,100
<4-10,House>抛锚，尖叫
<4-10,House>Clubbing, shrieking.

95
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,400
<4-11,Stacy>你干嘛呢?
<4-11,Stacy>What are you doing?

96
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,600
<4-12,House>对不起，这简直把我逼疯了
<4-12,House>Sorry, it was driving me nuts.

97
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,300
<4-13,Stacy>你痛恨洗碗
<4-13,Stacy>You hate washing dishes.

98
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,500
<4-14,House>人可以变
<4-14,House>People change.

99
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,700
<4-14,House>我能确保你今夜熟睡如婴儿
<4-14,House>I could make sure you sleep like a baby tonight.

100
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,700
<4-15,Stacy>我宁愿自己对付
<4-15,Stacy>I'd rather take care of it myself.

101
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,700
<4-16,House>我是在跟老鼠谈条件
<4-16,House>I was referring to the rat.

102
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,800
<4-17,Stacy>特伦顿灭害所派的是个同性恋
<4-17,Stacy>Trenton pest is sending a guy.

103
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,700
<4-18,Mark>干嘛呢?
<4-18,Mark>What's going on?

104
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,100
<4-19,House>不象你想的那样
<4-19,House>It's not what you think.

105
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,400
<4-19,House>我知道看上去我们象在洗碗
<4-19,House>I know it looks like we're cleaning dishes

106
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,100
<4-19,House>但其实我们在做爱呢
<4-19,House>but actually, we're having sex.

107
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,400
<4-20,Stacy>我们在工作
<4-20,Stacy>We're working.

108
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,900
<4-21,Mark>哇，真希望我能成为个医生
<4-21,Mark>Wow, wish I'd become a doctor.

109
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,400
<4-21,Mark>毫无污点的活着
<4-21,Mark>Place'd be spotless.

110
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,000
<4-22,Stacy>拿出10分钟来，把那家伙治好,别再搅和了
<4-22,Stacy>Take ten minutes, cure the guy, and stop whining.

111
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,300
<5-1,House>我给你凯莱
<5-1,House>I give you Kalvin Ryan.

112
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:22,200
<5-1,House>私下里精彩，报纸上无聊
<5-1,House>So flamboyant in person, so boring on paper.

113
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:26,600
<5-1,House>明显的机会性感染，TB 或 PCP.
<5-1,House>Obviously got an opportunistic infection, probably TB or PCP.

114
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,300
<5-2,Foreman>你看他的病例了吗？
<5-2,Foreman>Have you read his file?

115
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:32,700
<5-3,House>开始了，但我发现了双重人格
<5-3,House>I started, but I found the characters two-dimensional.

116
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,300
<5-4,Foreman>他上周去了一间艾滋病诊所
<5-4,Foreman>He went to an HIV clinic last week.

117
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:39,100
<5-4,Foreman>TB, PCP, MAC, CMV, HSV测试全是阴性
<5-4,Foreman>Tested negative for TB, PCP, MAC, CMV, HSV.

118
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,300
<5-4,Foreman>不是感染
<5-4,Foreman>It's not an infection.

119
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:44,400
<5-5,House>艾滋病诊所，病人很少，钱很多,重做测试
<5-5,House>HIV clinic, so few patients, so much money. Redo the tests.

120
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,800
<5-6,Cameron>结果是有道理的
<5-6,Cameron>The results make sense.

121
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,300
<5-6,Cameron>凯的t细胞读数200
<5-6,Cameron>Kalvin's t-cells are at 200.

122
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,000
<5-6,Cameron>足以抵抗感染
<5-6,Cameron>That's strong enough to fight infection.

123
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,400
<5-7,House>对，寄生虫
<5-7,House>Fine, parasite.

124
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,300
<5-8,Chase>不对，大便测试是阴性
<5-8,Chase>Nope, stool sample was negative.

125
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,300
<5-9,Cameron>两个以前他的T细胞减到了30
<5-9,Cameron>Two months ago he was down to 30 t-cells.

126
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,300
<5-9,Cameron>然后他改变了用药,是免疫系统反弹
<5-9,Cameron>Then he changed his meds, is immune system rebounds

127
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,400
<5-9,Cameron>他的滤过性病毒承载量减低了
<5-9,Cameron>his viral load drops.

128
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,800
<5-9,Cameron>一切都变好了，可他的病变重了
<5-9,Cameron>Everything's getting better, but he's getting sicker.

129
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,100
<5-10,Foreman>面对吧，也许是个有趣的病例
<5-10,Foreman>Face it, this might be an interesting case.

130
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:15,300
<5-11,House>如果他的免疫系统过强如何?
<5-11,House>What if his immune system is too strong?

131
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,400
<5-12,Cameron>HIV是自身免疫系统疾病,不可能的
<5-12,Cameron>And autoimmune disease with HIV, that's impossible.

00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:23,900
<5-13,House>他的HIV新药唤醒了他的系统
<5-13,House>His new HIV meds kicked his system out of a sound sleep.

133

<5-13,House>被饥饿、暴躁地唤醒后急需作战
<5-13,House>Wakes up hungry, cranky, spoiling for a fight.

134
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,900
<5-13,House>当无法找到积极感染时
<5-13,House>When it doesn't find an active infection

<5-13,House>它开始寻找过去感染的无害痕迹进行进攻
<5-13,House>it starts attacking the harmless remnants of old infections.

136

<5-13,House>免疫边缘系统综合症
<5-13,House>Immune reconstitution syndrome.

<5-14,Foreman>他的药使他强壮后他把自己弄病了
<5-14,Foreman>His meds made him so much better, he made himself sick.

138
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,000
<5-14,Foreman>听上去……
<5-14,Foreman>Sounds pretty--

139
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,900
<5-15,House>真无聊
<5-15,House>boring!

140
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,000
<5-15,House>一点趣味都没有
<5-15,House>This is so not interesting.

141
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,200
<5-15,House>胸部X透视找到陈旧感染,注射类固醇吧
<5-15,House>Chest x-ray to find the old infections. Start him on steroids.

142
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,600
<6-1,Wilson>如果你错了，类固醇会击败他的免疫系统
<6-1,Wilson>If you're wrong, steroids will tank his immune system.

143
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,400
<6-1,Wilson>他的情况会变坏
<6-1,Wilson>He'll get worse.

144
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,300
<6-2,House>那样就有趣了
<6-2,House>Now that would be interesting.

145
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,500
<6-2,House>Coumadin在哪?
<6-2,House>Where's the coumadin?

146

<6-3,Wilson>如果你的病人有血液问题
<6-3,Wilson>If your patient's got a blood problem

147
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,600
<6-3,Wilson>血液稀释剂就会...

<6-4,House>是给史黛西的老鼠预备的
<6-4,House>it's for Stacey's rat.

152
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,100
<6-6,House>我才不要她回来呢
<6-6,House>I don't want her back.

153
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,700
<6-6,House>我只是想让她承认对我的感觉而已
<6-6,House>I just want her to admit her feelings for me.

154
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,900
<6-6,House>我去找卡迪
<6-6,House>I go to Cuddy.

155
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,800
<6-6,House>卡迪炒掉她或重新分配她
<6-6,House>Cuddy fires her or reassigns her.

156
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,200
<6-6,House>任何结果我都高兴
<6-6,House>Either way, I'm happy.

157
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,200
<6-7,Wilson>如果你想赢回她，要么就告诉她...
<6-7,Wilson>If you want her back, either tell her...

158
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,100
<6-7,Wilson>或者干脆，闭嘴...
<6-7,Wilson>or better yet, shut up...

159
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,300
<6-7,Wilson>痛哭着象其他人一样入睡
<6-7,Wilson>and cry yourself to sleep like everybody else.

<6-8,House>你好，我是万马克，春街1724号
<6-8,House>Hi, this is Mark Warner. 1724 Spring street.

<6-8,House>不用派人来了
<6-8,House>Uh, listen, you don't need to send that guy down.

<6-8,House>我们抓到老鼠了
<6-8,House>We caught him.

163

00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,900
<7-2,Kalvin>也许该让蔡大夫检查
<7-2,Kalvin>Maybe Dr. Chase should check.

167
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,500
<7-3,Chase>对不起，我腾不出手来
<7-3,Chase>Sorry, my hand's full.

168
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,300
<7-4,Kalvin>他太漂亮了，不可能是异性恋
<7-4,Kalvin>He's too pretty to be straight.

<7-6,Kalvin>每天
<7-6,Kalvin>Every day.

172
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,000
<7-6,Kalvin>你以为我怎么就做了摄影师的?
<7-6,Kalvin>Why do you think I became a photographer?

173
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:10,400
<7-6,Kalvin>我猜你们不会在工作日约会的吧
<7-6,Kalvin>I'm guessing you guys didn't think about dating on career day.

174
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,500
<7-7,Cameron>我热爱我的工作
<7-7,Cameron>I love my job.

175
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,500
<7-7,Cameron>真的吗?
<7-7,Cameron>Really?

176
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,400
<7-8,Kalvin>你看上去是“异常满足”那类的
<7-8,Kalvin>You seem more the "find it exceptionally satisfying" type.

177
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,700
<7-9,Cameron>我不肯定这有区别
<7-9,Cameron>I'm not sure there's a difference.

<7-10,Kalvin>爱是爱
<7-10,Kalvin>Love is love.

182
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:33,900
<7-10,Kalvin>满足是社会认可,乐趣都可以延迟
<7-10,Kalvin>Satisfying is social validation. Fun can wait.

<7-11,Cameron>我有乐趣
<7-11,Cameron>I have fun.

184

<7-12,Chase>Last you heard of your father?

186
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,300
<7-13,Kalvin>我16岁他就把我赶走了
<7-13,Kalvin>He threw me out when I was 16.

187
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,800
<7-13,Kalvin>其实都一样
<7-13,Kalvin>It's just as well.

<7-13,Kalvin>我已经厌烦了生日时收到弹子枪作礼物
<7-13,Kalvin>I got tired of getting BB guns for my birthday

189
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,100
<7-13,Kalvin>因为我想要芭比娃娃
<7-13,Kalvin>when I'd asked for a barbie.

<7-16,Cameron>他很可爱
<7-16,Cameron>He's cute.

<8-2,House>希望马克的愤怒能最终消失
<8-2,House>Hopefully Mark's anger will go away eventually.

195
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,000
<8-3,Stacy>他没生气，他只是不喜欢你
<8-3,Stacy>He's not angry, he just doesn't like you.

196
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,900
<8-3,Stacy>没什么特别的
<8-3,Stacy>Nothing unique there.

197
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,200
<8-4,House>也没看他对你有多热情
<8-4,House>Didn't seem really wild about you either.

198
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,700
<8-5,Stacy>他对我没问题
<8-5,Stacy>He's fine with me.

199

<8-6,House>他愤怒，在小组是那么说的
<8-6,House>He's angry. He said so in group.

203
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,300
<8-9,Stacy>他不是那么说的
<8-9,Stacy>There's no way he said that.

204
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,100
<8-10,House>可是事实
<8-10,House>No. But it's true.

00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,300
<8-10,House>他恨你能走路
<8-10,House>He resents you for being able to walk.

206
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,000
<8-10,House>我经历过
<8-10,House>I've been there.

00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,100
<8-10,House>我恨了你好长时间
<8-10,House>I resented you for a hell of a long time.

208
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,400
<8-11,Stacy>过去时态吗?
<8-11,Stacy>Past tense?

209
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,600
<8-12,Stacy>也许是医院
<8-12,Stacy>Might be the hospital.

210

<8-19,House>不奇怪，也没有医学关联
<8-19,House>Not surprising, not medically relevant.

<9-8,Kalvin>Or I could get hit by a bus.

<10-1,Doctor>他把感染的血咳进,卡麦伦嘴和眼睛里
<10-1,Doctor>He coughs infected blood in Cameron's eyes and mouth.

262
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,000
<11-1,House>那样有趣？
<11-1,House>That's interesting.

263
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,300
<11-2,Foreman>咳嗽的部分,不是“进卡麦伦”部分
<11-2,Foreman>The coughing part, not the "in Cameron" part.

<11-5,House>免疫边缘问题被排除了
<11-5,House>Well, it takes immune reconstitution off the table.

268
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,300
<11-5,House>那么什么显露出来了呢?
<11-5,House>What's it put on the table?

00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,500
<11-5,House>没事，她不在这里
<11-5,House>It's Okay, she's not here.

00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,300
<11-5,House>你可以省略掉好人举止
<11-5,House>You can skip the nice guy acts.

271

<11-6,Foreman>你知道，人类可以有人类的情感
<11-6,Foreman>You know, some human beings are actually capable of human feelings.

272
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,800
<11-7,House>我是否在意都无法改变历史
<11-7,House>My giving a damn or not is not gonna change what happened.

00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,900
<11-8,Chase>是不是排泄系统综合症
<11-8,Chase>Could be good pasture's syndrome.

<11-9,House>No edema. No bloody urine.

275
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,500
<11-10,Foreman>面部损伤可能源于肺部损伤,躯体失血
<11-10,Foreman>KS on his face could mean KS in his lungs with bleeding from the lesions.

276
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,200
<11-11,Chase>有的话在肺部缝合时我会看到
<11-11,Chase>I would have seen them when I repaired the tear in his lung.

277
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,900
<11-11,Chase>肉芽肿?
<11-11,Chase>Wegener's granulomatosis?

00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,100
<11-12,Cameron>那会引起类固醇反应
<11-12,Cameron>Wegener's would have responded to steroids.

279
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,700
<11-13,Chase>或许你该回家去休息
<11-13,Chase>Maybe you should go home, take the rest of the day.

280
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,800
<11-14,Cameron>我没事
<11-14,Cameron>I'm fine.

281
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,600
<11-15,House>哦，很好
<11-15,House>Oh, this is good.

282
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,600
<11-15,House>他假意关心，而你假装不在意
<11-15,House>He's pretending to care, you're pretending not to.

283
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,900
<11-16,Cameron>我觉得我们该重新考虑毒品
<11-16,Cameron>I think we should reconsider drugs.

286
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,600
<11-17,House>就已经足够注意了
<11-17,House>while indulging in deadly street drugs.

287

<11-17,House>对矛盾的研究
<11-17,House>A study in contradictions.

288
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,200
<11-17,House>有趣，但不相关
<11-17,House>Interesting, still not medically relevant.

289
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,800
<11-18,Cameron>如果他的毒品污染了就相关了
<11-18,Cameron>It could be if his drugs were tainted.

290
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,600
<11-18,Cameron>他们用电解酸、碱和灯油加工晶体
<11-18,Cameron>They cook meth with battery acid, lye, lantern fuel.

<11-19,House>找到凯的药片，测试毒素
<11-19,House>Find Kalvin's pills, test for toxins.

292
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,700
<11-19,House>福满，你跟我走
<11-19,House>Foreman, you're with me.

00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,200
<11-20,House>另一个病例我需要协助
<11-20,House>I need a consult on another case.

294
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,300
<11-21,Foreman>我们有另一个病例吗?
<11-21,Foreman>We have another case?

295
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,600
<11-22,House>是个屁兜交易
<11-22,House>It's a hip-pocket deal.

<11-22,House>病人显示明显的颈部倾斜
<11-22,House>Patient presents with a distinct neck tilt.

00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,400
<11-26,House>他没抱怨过
<11-26,House>None that he's complained of.

301
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,300
<11-27,Foreman>最佳的相关问题是耳朵和肺
<11-27,Foreman>Best case scenario, an infection in the ear or lungs.

302
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,100
<11-27,Foreman>最坏的情况是脑干瘤
<11-27,Foreman>Worst case, brain stem tumor.

<11-27,Foreman>需要做核磁共振,分层扫描全套检查
<11-27,Foreman>Should do an MRI, cat scan, full workup.

<11-28,House>我不认为行，没保险
<11-28,House>Uh, I don't think so. No insurance.

305
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,300
<12-1,Cameron>这没药
<12-1,Cameron>No drugs in here.

306

<12-1,Cameron>我查浴室
<12-1,Cameron>I'll take the bathroom.

307
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,400
<12-2,Chase>工作后喝一杯如何?
<12-2,Chase>How about a drink after work?

308
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,200
<12-2,Chase>帮你排遣一下
<12-2,Chase>Take your mind off what happened.

309
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,700
<12-2,Chase>卡麦伦?
<12-2,Chase>Cameron?

<12-3,Cameron>我也许带HIV，喝酒又不能冲走它
<12-3,Cameron>I might have HIV. A drink's not gonna wash it away.

311
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,100
<12-4,Chase>可你也或许没法缩小它啊
<12-4,Chase>There's, like, zero chance of you contracting the virus.

312
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,400
<12-5,Cameron>没法和或许没法不一样
<12-5,Cameron>Big difference between like zero and zero.

313
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,600
<12-6,Chase>感染控制那家伙说什么了?
<12-6,Chase>What did the infection control guy tell you?

314
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,400
<12-7,Cameron>他挺安心的
<12-7,Cameron>He was very reassuring.

315
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:07,000
<12-7,Cameron>一个劲告诉我,医院会负担我所有医药费用
<12-7,Cameron>Kept reminding me that the hospital covers all my medical costs.

316
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,500
<12-7,Cameron>明显忘记提到如果我的测试阳性
<12-7,Cameron>Apparently forgot to mention that if I do test positive

317
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,800
<12-7,Cameron>他们就诉诸法律
<12-7,Cameron>that they'll pass it onto legal.

318
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,100
<12-7,Cameron>而一旦诉诸法律他们就会尽力..
<12-7,Cameron>And legal will dig up any dirt they can,trying to prove that I'm A...

319
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:17,800
<12-7,Cameron>我是因为有毒瘾或磕药而染上HIV
<12-7,Cameron>drug user or a tramp and that's why I have HIV.

320
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,100
<12-8,Chase>他们不会发现什么吧，对吗?
<12-8,Chase>It's not like they're gonna find anything, right?

321
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:21,900
<12-9,Cameron>对
<12-9,Cameron>Right.

334
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,500
<13-5,Chase>我能应付
<13-5,Chase>I can handle it.

335
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,500
<13-6,House>没理由使整个团队都冒感染的危险
<13-6,House>No reason to risk exposing the entire team.

<14-1,Kalvin>我对……发生的事感到抱歉
<14-1,Kalvin>I'm sorry...about what happened.

00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,400
<14-2,Cameron>你会感到刺痛
<14-2,Cameron>You'll feel a sharp pinch.

340
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,600
<14-2,Cameron>这其实是要把你的肺揪一点下来
<14-2,Cameron>This actually is gonna grab a piece of your lung.

341
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,600
<14-3,Kalvin>你们到我酒店里去找什么?
<14-3,Kalvin>What were you guys looking for at my hotel?

<14-7,Kalvin>你又没跟我要样本
<14-7,Kalvin>You didn't ask me for a sample.

351
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,600
<14-7,Kalvin>你不是因为这个生气
<14-7,Kalvin>You're not pissed about this.

352
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,800
<14-7,Kalvin>你是因为我朝你咳血才生气的
<14-7,Kalvin>You're mad because I coughed blood on you.

353
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,700
<14-8,Cameron>那是事故
<14-8,Cameron>That was an accident.

354
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:54,100
<14-9,Kalvin>别装好人了，没用的
<14-9,Kalvin>Won't you stop being nice, it's useless.

355
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,200
<14-9,Kalvin>而且更糟，郁闷
<14-9,Kalvin>And worse, it's boring.

356
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,400
<14-9,Kalvin>生气吧
<14-9,Kalvin>Get angry.

357
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,900
<14-9,Kalvin>一个愚不可及的夜生活,就让我患了HIV
<14-9,Kalvin>I had one stupid night. I end up with HIV.

358
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,400
<14-9,Kalvin>你能想像我当时有多生气吗?
<14-9,Kalvin>Do you have any idea how pissed-off I was?

359
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,300
<14-10,Cameron>这又不是你的错
<14-10,Cameron>This wasn't your fault.

360
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,300
<15-1,Stacy>你擅闯我的房子?
<15-1,Stacy>You broke into my house?

361
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,200
<15-2,House>没辙，马克不在
<15-2,House>Well, I had to. Mark isn't here.

362
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,400
<15-3,Stacy>他去做理疗了
<15-3,Stacy>He has physio.

363
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,100
<15-4,House>哦，真的? 他怎样了?
<15-4,House>Oh, really? How's he doing?

364
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,100
<15-5,Stacy>所有的乳酪怎么了?
<15-5,Stacy>What happened with all the cheese?

365
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:25,500
<15-6,House>在麦史迪吃到更多coumadin前,我得把它们都处理了
<15-6,House>Well, I had to get rid of it before,Steve Mcqueen ate any coumadin.

366
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,100
<15-6,House>我给你的老鼠起了名
<15-6,House>I named your rat.

367
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,300
<15-6,House>史迪老歪着头
<15-6,House>Steve's tilting his head.

368
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,300
<15-6,House>任何神经系统医生都会告诉你
<15-6,House>Any neurologist will tell you

369
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:39,200
<15-6,House>是脑干瘤的感染结果所致
<15-6,House>that suggests an infection or a brain stem tumor.

370
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,600
<15-7,Stacy>死了就都治好了
<15-7,Stacy>Death cures both those things.

371
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,400
<15-8,House>哦，我们不能杀死它
<15-8,House>Oh, we can't kill him.

372
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,200
<15-8,House>如果是感染
<15-8,House>If it's an infection

373
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,500
<15-8,House>该是由你房子里其他东西所致
<15-8,House>it could be caused by something in your house.

374
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,900
<15-8,House>其他可能影响到你们的东西
<15-8,House>Something that could affect you guys.

375
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,400
<15-8,House>闻闻
<15-8,House>Smell this.

376
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,800
<15-8,House>味道象尿吗?
<15-8,House>Does it smell like urine?

377
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,800
<15-9,Stacy>哦
<15-9,Stacy>Oh!

378
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,300
<15-10,House>你少了芦笋吗?
<15-10,House>You missing any asparagus?

379
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,600
<15-10,House>好，填上这个
<15-10,House>Okay, stuff these.

380
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,700
<15-10,House>如果他没变好，那就是瘤
<15-10,House>If he doesn't get better, then it's a tumor.

381
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,100
<15-11,Stacy>然后干嘛，化疗吗?
<15-11,Stacy>Then what, chemo?

382
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,700
<15-12,House>麦史迪没毛?
<15-12,House>Steve Mcqueen without hair?

383
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,500
<15-12,House>他早死都该庆幸
<15-12,House>It's a blessing he died young.

384
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,100
<15-13,Stacy>喂
<15-13,Stacy>Hello.

385
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,600
<15-13,Stacy>哦，嗨，甜心
<15-13,Stacy>Oh, hi, honey.

386
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,400
<15-13,Stacy>对不起跟你错过了，对
<15-13,Stacy>I'm sorry I missed you. Yeah.

387
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,000
<15-13,Stacy>我到家了
<15-13,Stacy>I came home.

388
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,300
<15-13,Stacy>好，那一会儿见吧
<15-13,Stacy>All right, I'll see you in a few minutes.

389
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,200
<15-13,Stacy>再见，甜心
<15-13,Stacy>Okay. Bye, hon.

390
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,700
<16-1,Kalvin>胸疼
<16-1,Kalvin>Chest hurts.

391
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:55,200
<16-2,Foreman>心律100继续攀升,可能是过敏反应
<16-2,Foreman>Heart rate's 100 and climbing. Could bean allergic reaction.

392
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,000
<16-3,Cameron>颈部纹理清晰,应当是心包渗出
<16-3,Cameron>Neck veins are up. Must be pericardial effusion.

393
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,300
<16-3,Cameron>无喘息声
<16-3,Cameron>No wheezing.

394
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,400
<16-4,Foreman>肺部破裂肯定又开了
<16-4,Foreman>The tear in his lungs must have re-opened.

395
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:05,700
<16-5,Cameron>凯，你的心脏附近有出血
<16-5,Cameron>Kalvin, you're bleeding into the area around your heart.

396
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,200
<16-6,Kalvin>我要死了，无法呼吸
<16-6,Kalvin>I'm dying.I can't breathe.

397
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,000
<16-7,Cameron>血液冲击你的心脏
<16-7,Cameron>The blood's crushing your heart.

398
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,900
<16-7,Cameron>我们解决了，你会好的
<16-7,Cameron>Once we remove it, you'll be fine.

399
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,100
<16-8,Kalvin>如果我死了，请告诉我爸爸...
<16-8,Kalvin>If I die, please tell my dad...

400
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,400
<16-9,Cameron>你不会死
<16-9,Cameron>you're not going to die.

401
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,300
<16-10,Kalvin>告诉他我很抱歉
<16-10,Kalvin>Tell him sorry.

402
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,600
<16-11,Cameron>血在哪里?
<16-11,Cameron>Where's the blood?

403
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:33,800
<16-11,Cameron>根本没有啊
<16-11,Cameron>It's clear.

404
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,400
<16-12,Foreman>只有一个理由导致这样
<16-12,Foreman>Only one other thing could cause this.

405
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,400
<16-12,Foreman>心脏有瘤
<16-12,Foreman>A tumor in his heart.

406
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,400
<17-1,Wilson>CT 证实凯心脏有一个大的
<17-1,Wilson>CT confirmed a mass in Kalvin's heart

407
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,300
<17-1,Wilson>肺部还有些小的
<17-1,Wilson>and several smaller ones in his lungs.

408
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,700
<17-2,Foreman>所以他的心脏才肥大,而不是抗艾滋病药物导致
<17-2,Foreman>That's why his heart's enlarged. Not the AZT.

409
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,400
<17-3,Wilson>你没事吧？
<17-3,Wilson>You Okay?

410
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:57,100
<17-4,House>她没事，可能是被问题搞烦了
<17-4,House>She's fine. Probably getting bored with the question.

411
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,600
<17-4,House>心肺的麻烦
<17-4,House>Masses in the heart and lungs.

412
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,000
<17-4,House>我们见的是哪类的癌症?
<17-4,House>What kind of cancer are we looking at?

413
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,200
<17-5,Cameron>也许不是癌
<17-5,Cameron>They may not be cancerous.

414
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,300
<17-6,Wilson>是典型的非霍氏淋巴瘤
<17-6,Wilson>This is classic non-hodgkins lymphoma.

415
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,400
<17-6,Wilson>HIV 阳性病人长了早期心脏瘤？
<17-6,Wilson>HIV positive patient with a primary heart mass?

416
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,700
<17-7,Cameron>也许是类肉状瘤
<17-7,Cameron>It could be sarcoidosis.

417
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,000
<17-8,Chase>他的肺部活检是阴性
<17-8,Chase>His lung tissue is negative.

418
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,800
<17-9,Cameron>淋巴瘤是绝症,类肉状瘤是可治的
<17-9,Cameron>Lymphoma's a death sentence, sarcoidosis is treatable.

419
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,200
<17-10,House>耳部感染也是
<17-10,House>So's an ear infection.

420
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,300
<17-10,House>但他两项测试皆非阳性
<17-10,House>Since he didn't test positive for that either.

421
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,600
<17-11,Cameron>我要给他做siltzbach测试
<17-11,Cameron>I wanna do the kveim siltzbach test.

422
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:23,800
<17-12,House>你知道那样,卡迪会让你写多少报告吗？
<17-12,House>Do you have any idea how much paperwork Cuddy's gonna need signed?

423
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,500
<17-12,House>做吧
<17-12,House>Do it.

424
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:33,900
<17-13,House>那...
<17-13,House>So...

425
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,000
<17-13,House>病人的父亲怎样了?
<17-13,House>how is the patient's father?

426
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,300
<17-15,House>告诉我父亲很抱歉
<17-15,House>"Tell my dad I'm sorry."

427
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,100
<17-15,House>也许跟向公牛摇红旗一样效果
<17-15,House>Might as well have waved a red flag at a bull.

428
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,700
<17-16,Cameron>他并没要来
<17-16,Cameron>He's not coming.

429
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,100
<17-17,House>嗯，并不是悲剧
<17-17,House>Well, it's not a tragedy.

430
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,500
<17-17,House>爸爸不想看他，他也不想看爸爸
<17-17,House>Dad doesn't wanna see him, he doesn't wanna see the dad.

431
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,200
<17-17,House>你是唯一一个想看他们在一起的人
<17-17,House>You're the only one who wants them together.

432
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,100
<17-18,Cameron>他要求……
<17-18,Cameron>He asked--

433
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:59,100
<17-19,House>他以为要死了,人快死时会说谎的
<17-19,House>he thought he was dying. Dying people lie too.

434
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:02,400
<17-19,House>会希望少工作，多行善
<17-19,House>Wished they'd worked less. They'd been nicer.

435
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,600
<17-19,House>为小猫开孤儿院
<17-19,House>They'd opened orphanages for kittens.

436
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,100
<17-19,House>如果你真想干点什么,那就干吧
<17-19,House>If you really wanna do something, you do it.

437
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,900
<17-19,House>不为有回应而做
<17-19,House>You don't save it for a sound bite.

438
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,400
<17-20,Cameron>你要死的时候想怎样来着?
<17-20,Cameron>What did you say when you thought you were dying?

439
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,800
<17-20,Cameron>换个角度说...
<17-20,Cameron>On the other hand...

440
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,900
<17-21,House>他父亲把他扔出来
<17-21,House>his dad tossed him out.

441
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,000
<17-21,House>那么我们的伙计要道什么歉?
<17-21,House>So what's our guy want to apologize for?

442
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,200
<17-22,Cameron>人人都有遗憾
<17-22,Cameron>Everybody has regrets.

443
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,100
<18-1,Cameron>如果肺和心有肌肉生长
<18-1,Cameron>If the growths in your lungs and heart are sarcoid

444
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,300
<18-1,Cameron>那么你的身体会意识到这个材料
<18-1,Cameron>your body will recognize this material.

445
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,600
<18-1,Cameron>那么我们就会在手臂上看到反应
<18-1,Cameron>And we'll see a reaction on your arm.

446
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,300
<18-1,Cameron>你真想见你父亲吗?
<18-1,Cameron>Did you really want to see your dad?

447
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:49,800
<18-1,Cameron>你打给他了吗?
<18-1,Cameron>You called him?

448
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,200
<18-2,Kalvin>谢谢
<18-2,Kalvin>Thanks.

449
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,200
<18-2,Kalvin>要不他就会来把我修理一番
<18-2,Kalvin>He would've come and tried to straighten me out.

450
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,400
<18-2,Kalvin>你怎么撑下来?
<18-2,Kalvin>How are you holding up?

451
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:02,700
<18-3,Cameron>我挺好
<18-3,Cameron>I'm fine.

452
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,000
<18-4,Kalvin>令人信服
<18-4,Kalvin>Convincing.

453
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,700
<18-4,Kalvin>你把我的毒品怎么了?
<18-4,Kalvin>What'd you do with my drugs?

454
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,100
<18-5,Cameron>实验室在做完试演后会处置
<18-5,Cameron>The lab disposes of them after analysis.

455
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,500
<18-6,Kalvin>真可惜
<18-6,Kalvin>Too bad.

456
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
<18-6,Kalvin>它们本可以让你爽它一下
<18-6,Kalvin>They could have done you some good.

457
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,100
<18-7,Cameron>我可不来那套
<18-7,Cameron>They're not really my thing.

458
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,500
<18-8,Kalvin>你知道我希望你没被感染
<18-8,Kalvin>You know, I hope you don't have it.

459
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:25,900
<18-8,Kalvin>但是得了HIV令我获益良多
<18-8,Kalvin>But getting HIV might have been the best thing that ever happened to me.

460
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,300
<18-8,Kalvin>我曾是个好孩子
<18-8,Kalvin>I used to be a good boy.

461
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:32,100
<18-8,Kalvin>从不想惹任何人生气
<18-8,Kalvin>Never wanted to piss anybody off.

462
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:38,100
<18-8,Kalvin>按常规办事，讨好别人
<18-8,Kalvin>Playing by the rules makes everybody else happy.

463
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,100
<18-8,Kalvin>现在我很快乐
<18-8,Kalvin>Now I'm happy.

464
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:49,500
<19-1,Wilson>所以每次他做理疗你就出现？
<19-1,Wilson>So you just show up every time he's at physio?

465
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,900
<19-1,Wilson>当然不是
<19-1,Wilson>Of course not.

466
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:55,400
<19-2,House>还有他做心理咨询的时候,外出跟朋友吃饭的时候
<19-2,House>Also when he's at group therapy or out for dinner with friends.

467
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,600
<19-3,Wilson>而当她告诉马克你顺便...
<19-3,Wilson>And when she happens to mention to Mark that you dropped by...

468
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,200
<19-4,House>你把一切都告诉你妻子吗?
<19-4,House>you tell your wife everything?

469
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,300
<19-5,Wilson>那是个步骤
<19-5,Wilson>It's a...process.

470
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:11,400
<19-5,Wilson>可史黛西并不需要隐瞒马克这个啊
<19-5,Wilson>But Stacy doesn't have any reason to hide this from Mark.

471
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,300
<19-5,Wilson>她该知道，马克对你在那没意见
<19-5,Wilson>As far as she knows, Mark's okay with you being there.

472
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:17,100
<19-6,House>我打赌她尽量少跟马克提到我
<19-6,House>My bet is she mentions me to Mark as little as possible.

473
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:20,600
<19-6,House>她想他觉得她还对我有感情
<19-6,House>She thinks that he thinks that she still has feelings for me.

474
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,300
<19-6,House>你知道她为什么那么想吗?
<19-6,House>And you know why she thinks that?

475
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,700
<19-7,Wilson>因为她还对你有感情?
<19-7,Wilson>Because she still has feelings for you?

476
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,300
<19-8,House>如果你对，她确实告诉他了
<19-8,House>If you're right, she did tell him

477
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,000
<19-8,House>我今晚就进不了门了
<19-8,House>and I don't get through the door tonight.

478
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,700
<19-8,House>如果我对...
<19-8,House>If I'm right...

479
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,800
<20-1,Stacy>我们要在这呆多久?
<20-1,Stacy>So how long do we stay here?

480
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,300
<20-2,House>直到有事发生为止
<20-2,House>Until something happens.

481
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,700
<20-3,Stacy>我们在这他才不会出来呢
<20-3,Stacy>He's not gonna come out with us right here.

482
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:55,800
<20-4,House>我们在下风口，而且他有听力丧失
<20-4,House>We are downwind, and he seems to have a hearing loss.

483
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,900
<20-5,Stacy>他不瞎吧
<20-5,Stacy>He's not blind.

484
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,200
<20-6,House>麦史迪才不会在困难前退却呢
<20-6,House>Steve Mcqueen does not run from danger.

485
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,000
<20-6,House>抗生素，或者...
<20-6,House>Antibiotics, on the other hand...

486
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,000
<20-7,Stacy>他在药片周围吃?
<20-7,Stacy>he ate around the pill?

487
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,300
<20-7,Stacy>聪明
<20-7,Stacy>Smart.

488
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,500
<20-8,House>承认吧，你喜欢他
<20-8,House>Admit it, you like him.

489
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:17,000
<20-9,Stacy>对于老鼠来说，他挺好
<20-9,Stacy>He's all right. For a rat.

490
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,200
<20-10,House>你想知道他有多酷吗?
<20-10,House>You wanna know how cool he is?

491
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:26,600
<20-10,House>他的尿检显示含量中包括氰化物,甲醛和铅
<20-10,House>His urine showed traces of,hydrogen cyanide, formaldehyde, lead.

492
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,700
<20-10,House>他是烟民
<20-10,House>He's a smoker.

493
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,100
<20-10,House>是你丈夫抽的
<20-10,House>Your husband's been lighting up.

494
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,500
<20-10,House>他有够蠢，那样会导致他的aip……
<20-10,House>Which is particularly stupid,,given that it could 'cause his aip to--

495
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:41,400
<20-11,Stacy>好了，是我对着排气孔吹的烟,马克不知道
<20-11,Stacy>Okay, I blow my smoke into the vent so Mark doesn't know.

496
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,000
<20-12,House>我总知道
<20-12,House>I always knew.

497
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,100
<20-13,Stacy>你在吹牛
<20-13,Stacy>You're bluffing.

498
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:50,200
<20-14,House>我手术后的两个星期你开始的
<20-14,House>You started two weeks after my surgery.

499
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,400
<20-14,House>薄荷的……一个月后是轻型的
<20-14,House>Menthols... then lights after a month.

500
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,300
<20-15,Stacy>你干嘛不说话啊?
<20-15,Stacy>Why didn't you say anything?

501
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,800
<20-16,House>因为那帮助我监视你的痛苦指数
<20-16,House>'Cause it helped me monitor your misery level.

502
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,900
<20-16,House>出去遛一下一天过的不错
<20-16,House>One trip outside was a good day.

503
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:04,300
<20-16,House>6根以上，一点糟透了
<20-16,House>Upwards of six, you were in hell.

504
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,300
<20-17,Stacy>你可以问我我的感觉
<20-17,Stacy>You could have asked me how I was.

505
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,300
<20-18,House>我已经知道了
<20-18,House>I already knew.

506
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,700
<20-18,House>我很遗憾你感觉凄惨
<20-18,House>I'm sorry you were miserable.

507
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,400
<20-19,Stacy>抱歉给你带来这么多痛苦
<20-19,Stacy>Sorry I caused you so much pain.

508
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,000
<21-1,Chase>看看你是不是对喝酒改主意了
<21-1,Chase>Thought you'd change your mind about that drink.

509
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
<21-2,Cameron>进来
<21-2,Cameron>Come on in.

510
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,000
<21-3,Chase>你该换衣服了
<21-3,Chase>You should get changed.

511
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
<21-3,Chase>校园里有个新地方……
<21-3,Chase>There's this new place on campus that looks--

512
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,100
<21-3,Chase>你high了吧?
<21-3,Chase>Are you high?

513
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,000
<21-5,Chase>我以为实验室处置了毒品
<21-5,Chase>I thought the lab disposed of the drugs.

514
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,200
<21-6,Cameron>不是所有的
<21-6,Cameron>Not all of it.

515
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,800
<21-7,Chase>哦，慢点……
<21-7,Chase>Uh, slow down.

516
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,500
<21-7,Chase>你们这些学生...
<21-7,Chase>Your pupils are dilated. You're not...

517
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,800
<21-8,Cameron>来吧，小蔡,别这会儿把我变成个好人
<21-8,Cameron>Come on, Chase, don't turn into a good guy on me now.

518
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,600
<22-1,House>你迟了
<22-1,House>You're late.

519
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,000
<22-1,House>而且疲劳
<22-1,House>And hung over.

520
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,600
<22-1,House>或者不是
<22-1,House>Or maybe not.

521
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,300
<22-2,Cameron>你拿个老鼠干嘛?
<22-2,Cameron>Why do you have a rat?

522
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,300
<22-3,House>嫉妒吗?
<22-3,House>Jealous?

523
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,100
<22-4,Kalvin>滚出我房间
<22-4,Kalvin>Out of my room!

524
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,500
<22-5,Dad>你竟敢把这安在我身上
<22-5,Dad>Don't you dare put this on me!

525
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,000
<22-6,Kalvin>我不会哀求你的，爸爸
<22-6,Kalvin>I'm not gonna grovel, dad.

526
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,700
<22-7,Dad>我不要求那样
<22-7,Dad>That's not what I'm asking for.

527
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,300
<22-8,Kalvin>就是，你说的你不打电话
<22-8,Kalvin>Like hell it isn't. You said you didn't call.

528
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,100
<22-9,House>别介意我，来看表演的
<22-9,House>Don't mind me. Just here for the show.

529
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,300
<22-10,Dad>不会有了
<22-10,Dad>Well, there's not gonna be any.

530
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,500
<22-11,House>那个大道歉在哪里?
<22-11,House>What happened to the big apology?

531
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:35,100
<22-11,House>昨天他还在那,“哦，爸爸，我很抱歉”
<22-11,House>Yesterday, he was all, "daddy, I'm so sowwy."

532
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,600
<22-12,Kalvin>这没你事
<22-12,Kalvin>This is none of your business.

533
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,400
<22-13,House>你该在杵我之前就想到
<22-13,House>You should have thought of that before you stalked me.

534
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,600
<22-13,House>现在我的兴趣被提起来了
<22-13,House>Now I'm interested.

535
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,500
<22-13,House>那么他要道什么歉?
<22-13,House>So what's he gotto apologize for?

536
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,800
<22-13,House>你是那个把他扔出去的人
<22-13,House>You're the one who tossed him out.

537
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,900
<22-14,Dad>哦，我干嘛要那样做?
<22-14,Dad>Now, why would I do that?

538
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:47,900
<22-15,House>我不知道，因为那样,跟打猎的伙伴吹很久带劲
<22-15,House>I don't know, 'cause it's tough to brag to your hunting buddies

539
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,600
<22-15,House>你儿子是个奇才
<22-15,House>that your son knows all the words to the wiz.

540
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,400
<22-16,Dad>撒谎
<22-16,Dad>That's a lie.

541
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,200
<22-17,House>42号街
<22-17,House>42nd street.

542
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,600
<22-17,House>干脆喝酒然后打他更容易
<22-17,House>Much easier just to get drunk and beat him.

543
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,100
<22-17,House>可以解释他恨你
<22-17,House>Explains his hating you.

544
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,800
<22-17,House>和你的硬化
<22-17,House>Also your cirrhosis.

545
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,300
<22-17,House>也可以解释我说的越多你越出汗
<22-17,House>Also why the more I talk, the more you sweat.

546
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,500
<22-17,House>但不能解释...
<22-17,House>What it doesn't explain...

547
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,900
<22-17,House>他向你道歉的理由
<22-17,House>is why he's gotta apologize to you.

548
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:10,900
<22-17,House>由跟朋友分享特别的玩具,而带来的愧疚吗？
<22-17,House>Residual guilt for sharing your special toy with other boys?

549
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,200
<22-18,Kalvin>算了吧
<22-18,Kalvin>Just leave it alone.

550
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,400
<22-19,House>想在你死后给这个老顽固,留下内行平静吗?
<22-19,House>You just wanna leave the bigot with,some peace of mind after you're gone?

551
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,000
<22-20,Dad>这里没什么事,我跟他……
<22-20,Dad>Look, this has got nothing, and I mean nothing

552
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,300
<22-20,Dad>成为同性恋无关
<22-20,Dad>to do with him being gay.

553
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:22,600
<22-20,Dad>凯说的事是跟他妈妈的事有关
<22-20,Dad>Kal brought this on himself with what he did to his mother.

554
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,800
<22-21,House>他偷走了她的长相?
<22-21,House>He steal her signature look?

555
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,700
<22-22,Dad>不
<22-22,Dad>No.

556
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,600
<22-22,Dad>不，他杀了她
<22-22,Dad>No, he killed her.

557
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,100
<23-1,Cameron>凯说谎了
<23-1,Cameron>Kalvin lied.

558
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,400
<23-2,House>是啊，真令人惊讶
<23-2,House>Yeah, that certainly is shocking.

559
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,300
<23-3,Cameron>妈妈的肾脏失效，需要移植
<23-3,Cameron>Mom's kidneys were failing, she needed a transplant.

560
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,300
<23-3,Cameron>他们测试了凯,他的合适
<23-3,Cameron>They tested Kalvin, he was a match.

561
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,000
<23-3,Cameron>他也是HIV阳性
<23-3,Cameron>He was also positive for HIV.

562
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,900
<23-3,Cameron>妈妈没有再找到捐献者，她死了
<23-3,Cameron>Mom never found a qualified donor. She dies.

563
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,000
<23-4,House>悲惨的故事
<23-4,House>Tragic tale.

564
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:57,300
<23-4,House>在稳定时刻的有点激情过度
<23-4,House>Undercut slightly by the rapid-fire delivery and constant movement.

565
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,000
<23-4,House>今早喝太多咖啡了吗?
<23-4,House>Too much coffee this morning?

566
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,900
<23-5,Chase>他又没杀她
<23-5,Chase>He didn't kill her.

567
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:02,000
<23-5,Chase>我们的身体又不是,给父母捐献的农场
<23-5,Chase>Our bodies aren't donor farms for our parents.

568
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,800
<23-6,Foreman>不是80年代
<23-6,Foreman>It's not 1980.

569
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,600
<23-6,Foreman>我们知道 HIV 可遗传
<23-6,Foreman>We know how HIV is transmitted.

570
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,300
<23-6,Foreman>如果凯通过未防护性生活得到HIV
<23-6,Foreman>If Kalvin got HIV through unprotected sex

571
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,700
<23-6,Foreman>爸爸当然有权生气
<23-6,Foreman>dad has every right to be pissed.

572
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,200
<23-7,Cameron>那你永远都用避孕套吗?
<23-7,Cameron>So you always use a condom?

573
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,900
<23-8,Foreman>哦，对
<23-8,Foreman>Uh, yeah.

574
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:15,000
<23-9,House>底层兄弟不得已而为啊
<23-9,House>Brothers on the down-low got to.

575

<23-10,Foreman>还没为后辈准备好,你呢?
<23-10,Foreman>Not ready for any foreman juniors yet.

576
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,200
<23-11,Cameron>职业女性真难对付
<23-11,Cameron>You?

578
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,500
<23-12,House>你不选小蔡吗?
<23-12,House>You're not gonna poll Chase?

579
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,600
<23-13,Chase>我不是蠢人
<23-13,Chase>I'm not an idiot.

580
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,600
<23-14,House>显然不是
<23-14,House>Obviously not.

581
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,600
<23-14,House>当有机会的时候谁不会睡一个,被毒品迷倒的同事呢？
<23-14,House>Who doesn't sleep with a drugged-out colleague when they have a chance?

582
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,800
<23-15,Cameron>韦森呢?
<23-15,Cameron>Where's Wilson?

583
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,500
<23-16,House>我们有检验结果了
<23-16,House>We got the results of the kveim test.

584
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:53,300
<24-1,Kalvin>那么，我得癌了吗?
<24-1,Kalvin>So, I have cancer?

585
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,700
<24-2,Wilson>是的
<24-2,Wilson>In all likelihood, yeah.

586
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,600
<24-2,Wilson>非霍氏淋巴瘤
<24-2,Wilson>Non-hodgkins lymphoma.

587
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:05,400
<24-3,Kalvin>我……快死了吗
<24-3,Kalvin>And I am...dying.

588
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,100
<24-4,Wilson>我们需要做肿瘤活检
<24-4,Wilson>We need to biopsy the tumor.

589
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:16,900
<24-4,Wilson>靠近你的大动脉,所以取样十分冒险
<24-4,Wilson>It's near your aorta, so getting,that sample carries serious risks.

590
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,700
<24-5,Kalvin>我爸还在这吗?
<24-5,Kalvin>Is my dad still here?

591
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,600
<24-6,Wilson>他还没进来吗?
<24-6,Wilson>He hasn't been in?

592
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:30,700
<24-6,Wilson>我们要在你心脏附近,注入颜色使其在ct上可见
<24-6,Wilson>We'll inject the dye around your heart to make the tumor visible on the CT.

593
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,000
<24-6,Wilson>然后外科医生输入导向管
<24-6,Wilson>Then a surgeon inserts a guidewire

594
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,900
<24-6,Wilson>指挥其进入心脏
<24-6,Wilson>runs it up into your heart

595
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,400
<24-6,Wilson>在那里他取肿瘤的样本
<24-6,Wilson>where he takes a small piece of that tumor

596
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,800
<24-6,Wilson>然后我们就可以在显微镜下观察了
<24-6,Wilson>so we can look at it under the microscope.

597
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,000
<24-6,Wilson>Atavan.
<24-6,Wilson>Atavan

598
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,800
<25-1,Chase>希望能帮你安静下来
<25-1,Chase>It'll help settle you down.

599
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,800
<25-2,Cameron>为什么你这么冷静？
<25-2,Cameron>Why are you so calm?

600
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,500
<25-3,Chase>不必晶体的帮助
<25-3,Chase>Not coming off meth helps.

601
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,000
<25-3,Chase>昨晚该不会再发生了吧
<25-3,Chase>Last night probably shouldn't happen again.

602
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,500
<25-4,Cameron>你认为我想要吗?
<25-4,Cameron>Do you think I want it to?

603
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:58,800
<25-5,Chase>当俩人性交后，除非不好
<25-5,Chase>When two people have had sex, unless it sucks

604
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,400
<25-5,Chase>如果他们能再做,他们会做的
<25-5,Chase>if they can do it again, they're gonna do it again.

605
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,600
<25-5,Chase>那样事情会变复杂
<25-5,Chase>And that's when things get complicated.

606
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,800
<25-5,Chase>而且不差
<25-5,Chase>And it didn't suck.

607
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:16,000
<26-1,Wilson>那么现在你又有了新理由,可以在你今生挚爱前晃了
<26-1,Wilson>So now you've gotta drum up another excuse to be around the love of your life.

608
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,800
<26-1,Wilson>在打另一个病人吧
<26-1,Wilson>Could hit another patient.

609
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,600
<26-2,House>不，不喜欢重复
<26-2,House>Nah, don't like to repeat myself.

610
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,200
<26-2,House>人们会说我刻板
<26-2,House>People will say I'm formulaic.

611
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,700
<26-3,Wilson>那样也排除了,放走耗子再去抓的可能性
<26-3,Wilson>Well that rules out letting the rat go so you can catch him again.

612
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,800
<26-4,House>我不能那样做
<26-4,House>I can't do that.

613
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,700
<26-4,House>史迪需要做两周的抗生素治疗,和无烟环境
<26-4,House>Steve needs two weeks antibiotics and a smoke free environment.

614
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:31,000
<26-4,House>香烟加重了他的感染
<26-4,House>Cigarettes aggravated his infection.

615
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,300
<26-5,Wilson>那老鼠真有病吗?
<26-5,Wilson>The rat is actually sick?

616
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,700
<26-5,Wilson>那玩意能污染整个医院
<26-5,Wilson>That thing could infect the entire hospital.

617
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:38,100
<26-6,House>史迪的感染不传染人类
<26-6,House>Steve's infection is not contagious to humans.

618
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:40,500
<26-6,House>我真蠢，怎么会漏掉coplasmosis?
<26-6,House>I'm an idiot. How do I miss my coplasmosis?

619
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,800
<26-6,House>那是孩子的父亲吗?
<26-6,House>Was that the kid's father?

620
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,400
<26-6,House>对
<26-6,House>Yeah.

621
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,700
<26-7,Wilson>记得黑死病吗？从老鼠开始的
<26-7,Wilson>Remember the black death? Started with rats.

622
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:45,600
<26-8,House>他在走廊里干嘛？
<26-8,House>Well, what's he doing in the hallway?

623
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,200
<26-8,House>那孩子准备好活检了吗?
<26-8,House>Is the kid getting his biopsy already?

624
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,500
<26-9,Wilson>他不想进屋
<26-9,Wilson>He just won't go in the room.

625
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:51,300
<26-9,Wilson>谁知道他还有什么,寄生虫，细菌感染？
<26-9,Wilson>Who knows what else he has. Parasites, bacterial infection?

626
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,600
<26-10,House>那孩子没有寄生虫
<26-10,House>The kid doesn't have parasites.

627
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,200
<26-11,Wilson>不是男孩，是老鼠
<26-11,Wilson>Not the kid, the rat.

628
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,600
<26-12,House>他还在出汗吗?
<26-12,House>Was he still sweating?

629
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,500
<26-13,Wilson>老鼠是尾部出汗
<26-13,Wilson>Rats only sweat through their tails.

630
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,800
<26-14,House>不是老鼠，是爸爸
<26-14,House>Not the rat, the dad.

631
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,500
<26-14,House>他们从哪来?
<26-14,House>Where are they from?

632
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,900
<26-15,Wilson>蒙坦那，怎么了？
<26-15,Wilson>Uh, Montana. What's going on?

633
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,700
<26-16,House>你对了，是寄生虫
<26-16,House>You were right, it's a parasite.

634
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,800
<26-16,House>取消活检，会致命的
<26-16,House>Cancel the biopsy, it'll kill him.

635
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,900
<26-16,House>嗨，爸爸，跟我来
<26-16,House>Hey, daddy, come with me.

636
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,900
<26-17,Dad>对啊，我才不进去
<26-17,Dad>Yeah, uh, I'm not going in there.

637
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
<26-18,House>你儿子要跟你说话
<26-18,House>Your son asked to talk to you.

638
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,800
<26-19,Kalvin>他干嘛来?
<26-19,Kalvin>Why is he here?

639
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,900
<26-20,House>他要跟你说话
<26-20,House>He wanted to talk to you.

640
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,500
<26-22,House>你们过去常一起打猎是吧?
<26-22,House>Did you two used to hunt together?

641
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,800
<26-22,House>狐狸，你们杀狐狸吗?
<26-22,House>Foxes. Did you kill foxes?

642
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,500
<26-23,Dad>是蒙坦那
<26-23,Dad>It's Montana.

643
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:43,300
<26-24,House>你们肺里的不是瘤
<26-24,House>Those masses in your chest are not tumors.

644
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:46,900
<26-24,House>是一个小虫的寄生囊，叫做包虫病
<26-24,House>They're parasitic cysts from a bug called echinococcosis.

645
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,600
<26-24,House>触摸死狐狸，它们跳上你
<26-24,House>Touch a dead fox, they jump aboard

646
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,500
<26-24,House>它们可以盘踞几十年
<26-24,House>they can hunker down for decades.

647
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,800
<26-24,House>成长、产卵，购物，上演戏剧
<26-24,House>Growing, spawning, shopping. Putting on plays.

648
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,400
<26-25,Kalvin>我做了寄生虫测试
<26-25,Kalvin>I've been tested for parasites.

649
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,900
<26-26,House>好吧，是癌症，你满意了?
<26-26,House>Okay, it's cancer. You happy?

650
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,200
<26-26,House>胞囊隔离寄生虫
<26-26,House>The cysts isolate the parasites.

651
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,000
<26-26,House>不让它们在大便检测中被查出来
<26-26,House>Keep them from showing up in stool samples.

652
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,200
<26-26,House>甚至是验血……
<26-26,House>Even a blood test, cardiac--

653
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,900
<26-27,Dad>好了，你不需要我帮忙干这个
<26-27,Dad>All right, you don't need me for this.

654
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:09,000
<26-28,House>但你的肝脏有同样问题
<26-28,House>But you've got the same things in your liver.

655
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,400
<26-29,Dad>我是硬化
<26-29,Dad>I have cirrhosis.

656
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:17,600
<26-30,House>肝脏胞囊症状相同，只一点不同,发烧
<26-30,House>Liver cysts have identical symptoms. With one addition, fever.

657
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,800
<26-30,House>肝脏胞囊我们可以测试
<26-30,House>And liver cysts we can test for.

658
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,400
<26-30,House>你的诊断可以验证凯的
<26-30,House>Your diagnosis could confirm Kalvin's.

659
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,300
<26-30,House>所以选项A－－我们抽血
<26-30,House>So, option A--we draw some blood--

660
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,300
<26-31,Dad>不，你们别碰我
<26-31,Dad>no, no, look, you're not touching me.

661
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:29,000
<26-32,House>看，这是我要你来的原因
<26-32,House>See, this is why I need you here.

662
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,500
<26-32,House>我要你告诉你儿子
<26-32,House>I want you to tell your son

663
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:34,200
<26-32,House>你不肯为挽救他的性命,做个简单的验血
<26-32,House>that you won't take a simple painless blood test to save his life.

664
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:55,100
<26-33,Dad>你从未对发生在你妈妈,身上的事表达过半点抱歉
<26-33,Dad>You never expressed a shred of regret for what happened to your mother.

665
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:56,400
<26-34,Kalvin>哦，爸爸
<26-34,Kalvin>Jeez, dad.

666
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:59,300
<26-35,Dad>如果你带套就没事了
<26-35,Dad>If you'd have worn a damn rubber, you'd have been fine.

667
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,000
<26-35,Dad>你或许能救她的命
<26-35,Dad>You could have saved her life.

668
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,700
<26-35,Dad>你也不会躺在这里
<26-35,Dad>You wouldn't be lying here.

669
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,800
<26-36,House>对，对，对，我明白了
<26-36,House>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it.

670
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,000
<26-36,House>你对他的自杀行为很愤怒
<26-36,House>You're really mad at him for killing himself

671
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,200
<26-36,House>那毁灭了一切你爱的
<26-36,House>and for destroying everything you love.

672
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,300
<26-36,House>我没时间看这个
<26-36,House>I don't have time for this.

673
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,900
<26-36,House>你要道歉吗?
<26-36,House>Are you gonna apologize?

674
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:15,000
<26-37,Kalvin>我用我的方式过活
<26-37,Kalvin>I'm living my life the way I want.

675
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,200
<26-38,House>你要给我血吗?
<26-38,House>Are you gonna give me some blood?

676
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,800
<26-39,Dad>你看，如果他不在乎，那我也不
<26-39,Dad>Look, if he doesn't give a damn, then neither do I.

677
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,800
<26-40,House>好吧，B方案
<26-40,House>Okay, option B.

678
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,600
<26-40,House>为什么你太太自杀？,她恨你吗？
<26-40,House>Why did your wife kill herself? Did she hate you?

679
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,600
<26-41,Kalvin>她有糖尿病
<26-41,Kalvin>She was a diabetic.

680
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,800
<26-42,Dad>你知道，你根本不了解苏珊
<26-42,Dad>You know, you don't know a thing about my Susan.

681
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:31,800
<26-43,House>要么就是苏珊想死,要么就是又胖又蠢
<26-43,House>Either Susan wanted to die, or she was both fat and stupid.

682
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,600
<26-43,House>用闪光棒代替枪
<26-43,House>Used a twinkie instead of a gun.

683
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,800
<26-43,House>大胃口的女孩
<26-43,House>And girls with big appetites

684
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,500
<26-43,House>她们对什么都没够
<26-43,House>well, they just can't get enough of anything.

685
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:39,100
<26-45,House>- 闭嘴,- 也许咬过所有州里的海军陆战队员
<26-45,House>- Shut up.,- Probably nibbled on every devil dog in the county.

686
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,900
<26-47,House>- 闭嘴,- 天啊，我说的不够明白
<26-47,House>- Shut up!,- Jeez, I'm not making myself clear.

687
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,500
<26-47,House>我不是说美味的零食
<26-47,House>I don't mean the delicious snack.

688
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,300
<26-48,Dad>你个狗娘养的
<26-48,Dad>You son of a bitch!

689
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,800
<26-48,Dad>好啊，来吧
<26-48,Dad>Yeah? Come on!

690
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:51,500
<26-49,House>谢谢你，我就可以干这个了
<26-49,House>Thank you. That means I can do this.

691
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,200
<26-49,House>我们这里需要做EPI
<26-49,House>We're gonna need some epi in here, stat!

692
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,500
<26-50,Kalvin>你疯了吗?
<26-50,Kalvin>Are you out of your mind?

693
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,700
<26-50,Kalvin>你说过你不在意的
<26-50,Kalvin>You said you didn't care.

694
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,800
<26-51,House>注意到你无法呼吸了吗?
<26-51,House>Notice how you can't breathe?

695
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,700
<26-51,House>要么是因为我的手杖
<26-51,House>Now either that's the cane

<27-2,Kalvin>如果是关于我妈的……
<27-2,Kalvin>If this is about my mom--

<27-3,Cameron>是关于你孤独、悲惨的人生
<27-3,Cameron>this is about your lonely, miserable life.

00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,500
<27-4,Kalvin>我不悲惨
<27-4,Kalvin>I'm not miserable.

722
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:09,800
<27-4,Kalvin>而且只要周围有同性恋吧,我就不孤独
<27-4,Kalvin>And as long as there's a gay bar around, I'm never lonely.

723
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,900
<27-5,Cameron>除了你爸，你连一个访客都没有
<27-5,Cameron>You haven't had a single visitor except for your dad.

<27-5,Cameron>Your dad hates you. You're so happy.

<27-5,Cameron>你因母亲的死而责怪自己
<27-5,Cameron>You blame yourself for your mom's death.

728
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:24,500
<27-5,Cameron>你不是在寻欢作乐,你是在毁灭自己
<27-5,Cameron>You're not trying to have fun, you're trying to self-destruct.

729
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:27,500
<27-5,Cameron>你要杀了自己吗？,好吧，但是别再招募新兵了
<27-5,Cameron>You wanna kill yourself? Fine. But stop recruiting.

00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,700
<28-4,House>我才是医生
<28-4,House>I'm the doctor.

735

<28-5,Stacy>我的关系是纯粹合法的,好像没事
<28-5,Stacy>My concern is purely legal. Looks okay.

00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,900
<28-5,Stacy>疼吗?

00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,300
<28-8,House>关于吸烟
<28-8,House>About the smoking.

741
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,800
<28-9,Stacy>他该说点什么
<28-9,Stacy>He would have said something.

742
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,400
<28-10,House>要不就是他已经数月没靠近你了
<28-10,House>Then he hasn't been near you in months.

743
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,100
<28-11,Stacy>我们没事

744
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,700
<28-12,House>不可能轻松
<28-12,House>Can't be easy.

00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,400
<28-13,Stacy>别乱动

<28-16,House>我不在乎你是否跟他睡觉
<28-16,House>I don't care if you're sleeping with him or not

749
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
<28-16,House>但你没有，所以……

<28-19,Stacy>你知道如果我有性生活,你能闻出味来?
<28-19,Stacy>You know when I have sex, you can smell that on me too?

<28-21,Stacy>You're confident, arrogant

758
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,300
<28-21,Stacy>但如果没有可确定的,你从不确定
<28-21,Stacy>but you are never certain unless there's a reason to be certain.

<28-21,Stacy>知道的另有其人
<28-21,Stacy>One other person knew.

<28-21,Stacy>你……
<28-21,Stacy>You have--

767

<28-21,Stacy>这段时间，你在操纵我

<28-22,House>往刷子上倒洗洁精
<28-22,House>poured soap onto a scrub brush.

<28-22,House>你可以把我扔出去
<28-22,House>You could've thrown me out.

771

<28-22,House>或者忽视我，或找另一个杀虫的
<28-22,House>Or ignored me, or found another exterminator.

772
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,800
<28-22,House>但你却没告诉马克我常顺道来
<28-22,House>But you didn't even tell Mark that I kept coming by.

773
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,300
<28-22,House>你任其发生因为你想跟我在一起
<28-22,House>You let this happen because you wanna be with me.

774
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,100
<28-23,Stacy>我不再想了
<28-23,Stacy>I don't anymore.
