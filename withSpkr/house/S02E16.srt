<5-21,Barbara>她没带急救针, 开车去的医院,中途昏倒, 出了车祸
<5-21,Barbara>She's forgotten her epi pen,she drives to the hospital,passes out,has an accident.

118
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:46,720
<5-21,Barbara>方向盘压碎了她的胸腔,她失去了心脏
<5-21,Barbara>Steering wheel crushed her chest.She ended up losing her heart.

119
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:49,010
<5-21,Barbara>你要跟我说
<5-21,Barbara>So when you say to me

120
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:53,570
<5-21,Barbara>我是最过度保护的家长之一, 请你...
<5-21,Barbara>that I'm one of the most overprotective parents you've seen,please...

121
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:58,740
<5-21,Barbara>请你介绍更过度保护的家长给我认识
<5-21,Barbara>please introduce me to the ones who were more protective

122
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:02,330
<5-21,Barbara>我看看我哪里做的还不够好
<5-21,Barbara>so that I can find out what they're doing right.

123
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:11,770
<6-1,Chase>也许她对郁闷的社交生活过敏
<6-1,Chase>Maybe she's allergic to having a sucky social life.

124
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:14,660
<6-2,Cameron>别指责她的家长了,他们是在保护她的健康
<6-2,Cameron>Give the parents a break.They're just trying to keep her healthy.

125
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:18,560
<6-3,Chase>这里的所有东西都写着"绝不致敏",不过还是查一下吧
<6-3,Chase>Everything in here's labeled "hypoallergenic."  Check it anyway.

126
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:23,090
<6-3,Chase>Cameron.
<6-3,Chase>Cameron.

127
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:28,000
<6-4,Cameron>这地方比医院还干净
<6-4,Cameron>This place is cleaner than her hospital room.

128
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:31,390
<6-5,Chase>这扇窗户没报警器
<6-5,Chase>No alarm on this window.

129
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,860
<6-6,Cameron>这里高20英尺
<6-6,Cameron>It's 20-foot drop.

130
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,240
<6-7,Chase>可以从这里到树上,这里的树皮刮掉了
<6-7,Chase>You can get to the tree from here.There's some bark scraped off.

131
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:38,240
<6-8,Cameron>是啊, 心脏移植的女孩,挂在藤条上荡
<6-8,Cameron>Sure. Heart-transplant girl swung wn there on a vine.

132
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,000
<6-8,Cameron>也许她和人猿泰山有一腿
<6-8,Cameron>Maybe she was hooking up with tarzan

133
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,820
<6-8,Cameron>然后骑着猎豹直奔大象墓园
<6-8,Cameron>and cheetah down by the elephant graveyard.

134
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:47,320
<6-9,Chase>或者...女主角留在树屋里,泰山上来
<6-9,Chase>Or...jane stayed in the tree house and tarzan came up.

135
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:53,870
<7-1,Dan>好吧, 周五晚上我逗留很长时间
<7-1,Dan>Okay.I spent most of the night friday.

136
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:57,670
<7-1,Dan>被她妈妈知道的话,会发疯的
<7-1,Dan>But if her mom finds out about that,she will totally freak.

137
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,300
<7-2,Chase>你们做爱了?
<7-2,Chase>You guys had sex?

138
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:03,140
<7-3,Dan>可是我已经采取措施,不让她得病
<7-3,Dan>But,you know,I did everything I could to make sure she wouldn't get sick.

139
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,630
<7-4,Chase>乳胶过敏?
<7-4,Chase>A latex allergy?

140
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,990
<7-5,Dan>什么意思? 避孕套?,我们没有
<7-5,Dan>What do you mean,like a condom? We didn't--

141
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,220
<7-6,Cameron>你们没有做防护?,你对不安全性爱一无所知吗?
<7-6,Cameron>you had unsafe sex?The whole unsafe thing didn't tell you something?

142
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:13,370
<7-7,Dan>做了, 可我们并不是计划好的
<7-7,Dan>Yeah,but we didn't like plan on it,you know?

143
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:16,700
<7-7,Dan>只不过..,我们深深相爱,我们一起已经两年
<7-7,Dan>It just--I don't know.We're in love.We've been dating for two years.

144
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:19,630
<7-8,Cameron>相当长的时间了,会不会是精液过敏?
<7-8,Cameron>Practically a lifetime.How about a semen allergy?

145
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:23,750
<7-9,Chase>我们需要精液样本
<7-9,Chase>We're gonna need a semen sample.

146
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,890
<7-9,Chase>你可以到那边的洗手间
<7-9,Chase>You can use the bathroom over there.

147
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:28,420
<7-10,Dan>知道了, 我怎么...
<7-10,Dan>Right. how do I...

148
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,740
<7-11,Cameron>瞄准了就射
<7-11,Cameron>aim and shoot.

149
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:35,570
<7-12,Chase>不准幻想Cameron,我们会知道的
<7-12,Chase>No thinking about dr. Cameron.We'll know.

150
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,510
<7-13,Cameron>我们应该告诉家长
<7-13,Cameron>We should tell her parents.

151
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:39,220
<7-14,Chase>就这样? 索性报警好了
<7-14,Chase>Why stop there?Call the cops.

152
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:40,400
<7-15,Cameron>Melinda还未成年
<7-15,Cameron>Melinda's a minor.

153
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,970
<7-16,Chase>如果我们说出去,这俩孩子可能再也不能有性爱
<7-16,Chase>And if we nip it in the bud here,teenagers will never again have sex.

154
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,030
<7-16,Chase>反正家长拿到帐单的时候会发现
<7-16,Chase>The parents will find out when they get the bill anyway.

155
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:47,370
<7-17,Cameron>所以他们自己发现就无所谓
<7-17,Cameron>Oh,so you're fine with them finding out

156
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:48,890
<7-17,Cameron>只要不让你去告诉他们?
<7-17,Cameron>as long as you don't have to tell them personally?

157
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,450
<7-18,Chase>差不多
<7-18,Chase>Pretty much.

158
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:58,120
<7-19,Cameron>可惜不是取你的样本,否则现在都已经搞定了
<7-19,Cameron>Too bad it's not you giving the sample.We'd be done by now.

159
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:02,600
<8-1,Cameron>测试呈阴性,没有精液过敏
<8-1,Cameron>Test was negative.No semen allergy.

160
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:06,920
<8-2,House>男朋友在前一晚溜进去和她温存
<8-2,House>Boyfriend sneaks in to get his freak on the night before the anaphylaxis.

161
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,410
<8-2,House>我不信这没有关联
<8-2,House>I don't buy that it's unrelated.

162
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:11,060
<8-3,Cameron>他爱她, 他做了一切措施,防止她生病
<8-3,Cameron>He loves her.Did everything he could to make sure she wouldn't get sick.

163
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:13,050
<8-4,House>这说明什么?
<8-4,House>What does that mean?

164
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:16,780
<8-5,Cameron>只有部分人能感受到爱这种体验,快乐也是如此
<8-5,Cameron>Love is an emotion certain people experience,similar to happiness.

165
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:19,860
<8-5,Cameron>算了 我还是找点更贴切的例子
<8-5,Cameron>No. Maybe I should give a more relatable example.

166
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,430
<8-6,House>行了!
<8-6,House>Oh,snap!

167
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:23,850
<8-6,House>他采取了什么措施保护她?
<8-6,House>What did he do to protect her?

168
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:25,540
<8-6,House>用猪鬃刷清洗私处?
<8-6,House>Brillo-pad his privates?

169
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:26,740
<8-7,Cameron>假设他洗了, 而且--
<8-7,Cameron>I assumed he washed and he--

170
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:31,490
<8-8,House>很好, 假设比问题要快速
<8-8,House>oh,good work.Assumptions are so much faster than actual questions.

171
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:44,100
<9-1,House>你是男朋友?,跟我来一下
<9-1,House>You the boyfriend?Need to borrow you.

172
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,870
<9-2,Barbara>怎么了?
<9-2,Barbara>What is going on?

173
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:49,690
<9-3,House>别担心, 我会把他大致原样送回
<9-3,House>Don't worry. I'll return him in roughly the same condition.

174
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,590
<9-3,House>你服用什么来保持健康?
<9-3,House>Do you take anything to stay healthy?

175
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,830
<10-1,House>不是指每天一个苹果的?
<10-1,House>Something stronger than an apple a day?

176
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:00,860
<10-2,Dan>他没事吧?
<10-2,Dan>Is he okay?

177
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:04,120
<10-2,Dan>他累了...因为昏迷太久
<10-2,Dan>He's just tired...from being in a coma so long.

178
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:05,770
<10-3,House>你吃了什么?
<10-3,House>What'd you take?

179
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:08,540
<10-3,House>别担心, 他会保守秘密
<10-3,House>Don't worry.He can keep a secret.

180
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:14,240
<10-3,House>抗生素?青霉素?
<10-3,House>Antibiotics?Penicillin?

181
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:17,100
<10-3,House>有没有比较熟的?
<10-3,House>Any of those names ring a bell?

182
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:22,740
<10-4,Dan>我朋友elliot, 他爸爸开了一瓶没吃完
<10-4,Dan>my friend elliot,his dad had,like,a whole bottle that he hadn't finished,

183
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:27,050
<10-4,Dan>我就拿过来,吃了大概一星期
<10-4,Dan>so I swiped it and took a bunch for,like,a week.

184
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:30,490
<10-4,Dan>我不会冒险把病菌传染给melinda
<10-4,Dan>There's no way I was gonna risk breathing germs on melinda.

185
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:34,940
<10-5,House>青少年性爱就是这么麻烦,你个白痴
<10-5,House>This is the one downside of teenage sex:You're idiots.

186
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,570
<10-5,House>你差点杀死你的女友

<10-6,Dan>你是说我嘴唇上还有?,我刷了牙的
<10-6,Dan>What,do you think there was still some on my lips?I brushed my teeth.

189
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:47,720
<10-7,House>位置再靠下点,有趣的地方
<10-7,House>Think lower and more fun.

190
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:53,200
<10-8,Dan>那能从...从那东西里穿过去?
<10-8,Dan>I mean,it can--it can go through your stuff?

191
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:55,170
<10-9,House>绝无问题
<10-9,House>Totally,dude.

192
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,040
<10-9,House>这医院有个行政管理,每次她一生病
<10-9,House>There's this administrator here,whenever she gets sick,

193
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,020
<10-9,House>就让我吃方子上的药
<10-9,House>she just gives me the prescription.

194
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:07,150
<10-10,Dan>可是他们做了测试,说melinda不会对我的那东西过敏
<10-10,Dan>But you know,they tested melinda,they said.she wasn't allergic to my stuff.

195
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,790
<10-11,House>四天了
<10-11,House>Yeah,four days later.

196

<10-11,House>那些青霉素早都在你洗衣蓝底部,的臧袜子上结痂了
<10-11,House>By that time,the penicillin was crusting up a sock at the bottom of your hamper.

197
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:16,210
<10-12,Dan>你一定会告诉她是我的错吗?
<10-12,Dan>Do you have to tell her it was my fault?

198
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:18,590
<10-12,Dan>不
<10-12,Dan>No.

<11-1,Barbara>你们让她出院?
<11-1,Barbara>You're releasing her?

201
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,310
<11-1,Barbara>怎么回事? 你们发现什么?
<11-1,Barbara>What happened?What did you find out?

<11-2,Cameron>对你家的检查排除了环境致敏
<11-2,Cameron>Tests on your house ruled out any environmental allergens.

00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:37,310
<11-3,Barbara>好, 那到底是什么?
<11-3,Barbara>Yeah,but what caused this?

204
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:40,840
<11-4,Cameron>我们相信这种情形不太可能再出现
<11-4,Cameron>We believe it's highly unlikely that this set of circumstances will repeat itself.

205
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,670
<11-5,Barbara>什么情形?
<11-5,Barbara>What set of circumstances?

<11-8,Melinda>我不能呼吸
<11-8,Melinda>I can't breathe.

209

<11-9,Cameron>肾上腺素
<11-9,Cameron>Getting the epi.

210

<11-14,Foreman>Crackling two-thirds of the way up.

<11-16,Barbara>她在呕吐, 你们还不打针?
<11-16,Barbara>She is vomiting.Would you give her the shot?

218
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,380
<11-17,Cameron>不是过敏, 是她的心脏
<11-17,Cameron>It's not an allergy.It's her heart.

219
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,650
<12-1,House>好消息是什么?坏消息是什么?

00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:31,770
<12-6,Chase>不知道, 这样比较像你
<12-6,Chase>I don't know.It just sounded like you.

225

<12-7,House>新的拼图, 总是好的,坏消息是什么?
<12-7,House>New puzzle piece.Always good news.What's the bad news?

<12-8,Foreman>两个碎片来自不同的拼图
<12-8,Foreman>We've got two puzzle pieces from two different puzzles.

227
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,640
<12-9,House>有道理
<12-9,House>Seems that way.

228
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,340
<12-10,Cameron>假如过敏症不是过敏症?
<12-10,Cameron>What if her anaphylaxis wasn't anaphylaxis?

00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:46,640
<12-10,Cameron>抗排异药物可导致痉挛和心衰
<12-10,Cameron>Toxicity from the anti-rejection meds could cause a seizure and then heart failure.

230
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:50,770
<12-11,House>结果被妈妈手里的肾上腺素治好?,这就是过敏, 还有什么?
<12-11,House>And get cured by a mommy-wielded epi pen?It's anaphylaxis.What else?

231
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:53,060
<12-12,Foreman>假如确实是两个拼图呢?
<12-12,Foreman>What if they really are two puzzles?

232
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:56,010
<12-13,Cameron>她在一周内连中两个疑难杂症?
<12-13,Cameron>You think she had two unrelated rare conditions in one week?

233
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:57,720
<12-14,Foreman>我们解释了过敏
<12-14,Foreman>We explained the anaphylaxis.

234
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,100
<12-15,House>什么, 我们? 是我
<12-15,House>What do you mean,we?I did!

235
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:03,730
<12-15,House>至少我认为是,结果还是我的功劳
<12-15,House>At least I thought I did.Maybe I didn'T.Still,it was all me.

236
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:07,320
<12-16,Foreman>心脏的问题, 对一个心移植患者来说,并不少见
<12-16,Foreman>Heart problems aren't so rare for someone who's had a heart transplant.

237
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:10,900
<12-16,Foreman>我们假设house对过敏的判断是对的
<12-16,Foreman>I say we assume house was right about the anaphylaxis.

238
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,270
<12-17,House>很诱人
<12-17,House>It is tempting.

239
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:17,660
<12-18,Foreman>心脏衰竭可以有几种原因,感染, 冠状动脉疾病, 排异
<12-18,Foreman>Heart failure could be either infection,coronary disease,or rejection.

240
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:22,190
<12-19,House>我们把它叫白板是有原因的,不是我规定的
<12-19,House>Sorry. There's a reason they call it the white board.It's not my rule.

241
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:26,790
<12-19,House>这些病因如何联系在一起?
<12-19,House>What ties both these conditions together?

242
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:37,330
<12-20,Foreman>我们可以面面相觑
<12-20,Foreman>Okay,we can all stare at each other,

243
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:40,040
<12-20,Foreman>或者我们调查心衰的原因
<12-20,Foreman>or we can investigate what caused the heart failure.

244
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:42,510
<12-20,Foreman>只是心衰
<12-20,Foreman>Just the heart failure.

245
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:45,790
<12-20,Foreman>把马克笔给我好吗?
<12-20,Foreman>You wanna give me that black marker?

246
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:54,050
<12-21,Cameron>没有发烧, 应该没有感染
<12-21,Cameron>There's no fever,so it's probably not infection.

247
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:57,510
<12-22,Chase>或者, 没有发烧是因为过去6个月,她的免疫系统一直被抑制
<12-22,Chase>or no fever because she's been on immunosuppressants for the last six months.

248
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:02,110
<12-23,Foreman>我们做个C.T, 心脏活检,重新验血
<12-23,Foreman>let's do a C.T.,Get a heart biopsy and redo the blood work.

249
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:03,670
<13-1,Cameron>发现什么?
<13-1,Cameron>Anything?

250
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,000
<13-2,Foreman>还没有
<13-2,Foreman>Not yet.

251
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,490
<13-2,Foreman>听说你不赞同青少年性爱
<13-2,Foreman>So I hear you don't want teenagers having sex.

252
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:10,710
<13-2,Foreman>青少年自杀率还不够高吗?
<13-2,Foreman>Teen suicide rate isn't high enough for you already?

253
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,140
<13-3,Cameron>我只是觉得这两个人被宠坏了
<13-3,Cameron>I just think those two are brats.

254
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:14,300
<13-3,Cameron>女儿一有机会就给她妈捣乱
<13-3,Cameron>The girl undercuts her mother any chance she gets.

255
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:17,610
<13-4,Foreman>女儿的错,妈妈拿她当小孩就没什么
<13-4,Foreman>It's the daughter's fault.Has nothing to do with mom infantilizing her.

256
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:17,930
<13-5,Cameron>好理由
<13-5,Cameron>Good point.

257
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,810
<13-5,Cameron>解释了为什么不关心小孩的家长
<13-5,Cameron>Explains why parents who don't pay attention

258
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,940
<13-5,Cameron>总是养出懂事的好孩子
<13-5,Cameron>get such nice,well-adjusted children.

259
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:24,080
<13-6,Foreman>这是什么?
<13-6,Foreman>What's this?

260
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,600
<13-7,Cameron>可能是赘生物?
<13-7,Cameron>Think it's vegetation?

261
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,410
<13-8,Foreman>好像是拉动心脏瓣膜的肌肉
<13-8,Foreman>The kind made of muscle that opens your heart valves.

262
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:33,280
<13-8,Foreman>没事, 她很正常
<13-8,Foreman>It's nothing.She's clean.

263
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:38,550
<13-9,Foreman>好消息 你没有任何心血管疾病
<13-9,Foreman>it's good news.You don't show any signs of coronary artery disease.

264
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,990
<13-10,Melinda>接下来是什么?
<13-10,Melinda>So what's next?

265
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:42,290
<13-11,Foreman>血检以排除感染
<13-11,Foreman>Well,blood work to rule out infection,

266
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,440
<13-11,Foreman>心外科活检以排除排异反应
<13-11,Foreman>and then a heart surgical biopsy to rule out rejection.

267
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:49,260
<13-12,Melinda>但是你觉得不可能两个都排除?
<13-12,Melinda>But you don't think you're gonna rule out both things,do you?

268
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,010
<13-13,Foreman>是的
<13-13,Foreman>No.

269
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:55,080
<13-14,Melinda>我会失去这个心脏, 是么?
<13-14,Melinda>I'm gonna lose this heart,right?

270
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:57,330
<13-15,Foreman>希望我们找到原因, 治好它
<13-15,Foreman>Hopefully we'll find the problem and fix it.

271
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,260
<13-15,Foreman>你的心还可以用很久
<13-15,Foreman>You'll keep your heart a long time.

272
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:00,350
<13-16,Melinda>多久?
<13-16,Melinda>How long?

273
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:04,800
<13-17,Foreman>医学的进步可以让你的心用几十年
<13-17,Foreman>There could be drug breakthroughs that allow you to keep it for decades more.

274
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,780
<13-18,Melinda>我的心脏科医生也是这么说的
<13-18,Melinda>That's the answer my cardiologist always gives me.

275
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:10,880
<13-18,Melinda>我在网上查过
<13-18,Melinda>I looked it up on the web.

276
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:14,450
<13-18,Melinda>差不多5年10年, 不是吗?
<13-18,Melinda>It's like five or ten years,right?

277
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,380
<13-19,Foreman>那是个平均数
<13-19,Foreman>That's about the average.

278
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:21,200
<13-20,Melinda>所以我需要生活
<13-20,Melinda>That's why I need to have a life.

279
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:24,080
<13-20,Melinda>为什么你不说服我妈让我回学校?
<13-20,Melinda>Why can't you convince my mom to let me go back to school?

280
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:28,610
<13-21,Foreman>Melinda,你现在的情况比失学更紧要
<13-21,Foreman>Melinda,you've got bigger worries right now than missing school.

281
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,970
<13-21,Foreman>我们查处你的心脏出了什么问题之前
<13-21,Foreman>Until we figure out what's wrong with your heart,

282
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:36,250
<13-21,Foreman>最安全的地方是家里
<13-21,Foreman>the safest place for you to be is right here.

283
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:09,050
<14-1,Wilson>那个...妓女在哪里?
<14-1,Wilson>where'S...the hooker,I assume?

284
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:12,250
<14-2,House>在我这里, 兄弟
<14-2,House>Right up here,buddy.

285
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:18,320
<14-3,Wilson>你说把听诊器挂上表示你在享受性爱
<14-3,Wilson>You said you'd hang the stethoscope if you were having sex.

286
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,400
<14-4,House>我没说一定和人
<14-4,House>I didn't say it had to be with another person.

287
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,030
<14-4,House>你能不能想出任何
<14-4,House>Can you think of anything that

288
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:25,010
<14-4,House>把过敏和心衰联系起来的因素?
<14-4,House>would tie together anaphylaxis and heart failure?

289
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:26,230
<14-4,House>没有
<14-4,House>No.

290
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,670
<14-5,Wilson>我在外面等了几个小时!
<14-5,Wilson>I was waiting out there for hours!

291
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,650
<14-6,House>我这人前戏很长
<14-6,House>I need a lot of foreplay.

292
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:33,450
<14-6,House>结束后还要爱抚
<14-6,House>And then there's the cuddling afterwards.

293
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:37,900
<14-6,House>有无可能不是过敏症,但还是对肾上腺素有反应?
<14-6,House>Any way that anaphylaxis isn't anaphylaxis even it responds to epi?

294
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,890
<14-7,Wilson>没有,难怪你这么有兴致
<14-7,Wilson>No. no wonder you were in the mood.

295
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:42,360
<14-7,Wilson>本月的心脏学期刊
<14-7,Wilson>This month's new jersey journal of cardiology.

296
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:43,750
<14-8,House>你看了中间彩页了?
<14-8,House>Have you seen the centerfold?

297
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,910
<14-8,House>那些瓣膜不可能是真的
<14-8,House>There's no way those valves are real.

298
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:49,760
<14-8,House>有无可能心功能衰竭是因为--
<14-8,House>Any chance that the heart failure could be unrelated to--

299
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:53,730
<14-9,Wilson>不, 如果你工作时不想被打扰,你可以说出来
<14-9,Wilson>no.If you need time alone to work,you just have to say so.

300
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:55,290
<14-9,Wilson>你不必说谎
<14-9,Wilson>You don't have to lie about it.

301
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:56,210
<14-10,House>骗人好玩
<14-10,House>Lying's more fun.

302
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,680
<14-11,Wilson>被骗就没那么好玩
<14-11,Wilson>Being lied to,not as much fun.

303
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,050
<14-12,House>请给出一个答案:
<14-12,House>Please have an answer to this question:

304
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,600
<14-12,House>晚餐吃什么?
<14-12,House>What's for dinner?

305
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:04,260
<14-13,Wilson>还是没刷盘子?
<14-13,Wilson>You still haven't done the dishes?

306
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:07,670
<14-14,House>要不要来点?,好像还有几个蓝莓
<14-14,House>You want one of these?I think I got a couple of blueberries.

307
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:11,670
<14-14,House>不好意思, 只有一个
<14-14,House>Nope. Sorry. Just one.

308
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,070
<14-14,House>别这么沮丧
<14-14,House>Oh,don't look all weepy.

309
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:17,780
<14-14,House>对我有意见, 冲我来啊
<14-14,House>You got a problem with me,deal with it.

310
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,350
<14-14,House>剪我的床单之类的
<14-14,House>Short my sheets or something.

311
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,710
<15-1,Foreman>活检排除了排异反应
<15-1,Foreman>biopsy was negative for rejection.

312
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,110
<15-2,Lewis>感谢上帝
<15-2,Lewis>Thank god.

313
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:31,320
<15-3,Barbara>血检的结果?
<15-3,Barbara>And what about the blood tests?

314
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:32,470
<15-4,Foreman>没有感染
<15-4,Foreman>Showed no infection.

315
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:35,170
<15-5,Barbara>所以我们还是不知道心衰的原因
<15-5,Barbara>So we still don't know what caused her heart failure.

316
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,930
<15-6,Lewis>我们可以暂时高兴一下,她不需要另一个心脏
<15-6,Lewis>Let's just be happy she doesn't need a new heart.

317
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,610
<15-7,Foreman>Bardach太太, 这可能只是一次偶然
<15-7,Foreman>Mrs. Bardach,it could have just been a one-time thing.

318
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:42,850
<15-8,Barbara>她有过敏反应和心力衰竭
<15-8,Barbara>So she has an allergic reaction and heart failure,

319
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,310
<15-8,Barbara>两样都没有眉目
<15-8,Barbara>and neither of them can be explained.

320
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,350
<15-9,Lewis>你们还在做什么检测?
<15-9,Lewis>Are they doing any more tests on her?

321
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,250
<15-9,Lewis>- 没有,- 她不在这里
<15-9,Lewis>No.She's not here.

322
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:55,470
<16-1,Cuddy>通知本地医院, 出租车公司,州警和本地警局
<16-1,Cuddy>notify local hospitals,cab companies,the state troopers,and local cops.

323
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:58,170
<16-1,Cuddy>休班安全人员取消休假
<16-1,Cuddy>Any security officers off duty are back on duty.

324
00:19:58,290 --> 00:19:59,120
<16-2,Voice replies>马上办理
<16-2,Voice replies>we're on it.

325
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:02,010
<16-3,Cuddy>我需要一些照片,检查那几个抽屉
<16-3,Cuddy>And I'm going to need some pictures.And go through those drawers.

326
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,660
<16-3,Cuddy>至少两人检查监视录像带
<16-3,Cuddy>And I want at least two people going over the surveillance tapes.

327
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:09,390
<16-5,Cuddy>- 这个可以吗?,- 这些是她的衣服?
<16-5,Cuddy>That work?Are those all her clothes?

328
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:12,150
<16-6,Barbara>她显然还在这楼里
<16-6,Barbara>She's obviously still in the building.

329
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,840
<16-7,Cuddy>她去哪了? 想干什么?
<16-7,Cuddy>So where did she go?What does she want?

330
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,650
<16-8,Foreman>看她男友?
<16-8,Foreman>See her boyfriend?

331
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,740
<16-9,Cuddy>她没带手机
<16-9,Cuddy>She didn't take her phone.

332
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:20,510
<16-10,Foreman>她想出去
<16-10,Foreman>She wants to be outside.

333
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:37,220
<16-11,Foreman>如果你想吓唬家长,你做到了
<16-11,Foreman>If you're trying to scare your parents,great job.

334
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,360
<16-11,Foreman>可以回去了吗?
<16-11,Foreman>Can we go back now?

335
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:43,720
<16-12,Melinda>我恨她
<16-12,Melinda>I hate her.

336
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:48,930
<16-13,Foreman>我8岁的时候, 病了
<16-13,Foreman>When I was eight years old,I was sick.

337
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,790
<16-13,Foreman>不是真的病了, 这不重要,当时我妈--
<16-13,Foreman>Not really sick,but the point is,my mom,she--

338
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:53,570
<16-14,Melinda>她一直就这样
<16-14,Melinda>she was like this before.

339
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:57,350
<16-14,Melinda>每晚9点回家, 周末不能出去,不能做运动
<16-14,Melinda>Home by 9:00 every night.Can't go out on the weekends.Can't do sports.

340
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:00,240
<16-14,Melinda>心移植正中她的下怀
<16-14,Melinda>Transplant just gave her what she always wanted.

341
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:03,650
<16-15,Foreman>Melinda...你有心力衰竭
<16-15,Foreman>Melinda...you had heart failure.

342
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:05,530
<16-15,Foreman>现在苛责你妈妈对你过分保护
<16-15,Foreman>This is kind of an insane time

343
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:08,740
<16-15,Foreman>有点不是时候
<16-15,Foreman>to be criticizing your mom about being overprotective.

344
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:16,000
<16-16,Melinda>我知道. 我是说,这就更糟糕了,她所有的这些疯狂,这就...
<16-16,Melinda>I know. I mean,this is what makes it even worse.All of her craziness,it just...

345
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:19,720
<16-16,Melinda>让它看起来更加合理了
<16-16,Melinda>it makes sense now.

346
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,390
<16-17,Foreman>一切都会好起来的
<16-17,Foreman>Everything's gonna be all right.

347
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:25,940
<16-18,Melinda>我甚至都没有试过到外面去
<16-18,Melinda>I didn't even try to get outside.

348
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:28,650
<16-18,Melinda>我太害怕了
<16-18,Melinda>I was too scared.

349
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,280
<16-19,Foreman>来吧
<16-19,Foreman>Come on.

350
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,280
<16-19,Foreman>Melinda,请朝着我往回走
<16-19,Foreman>Melinda,please walk back towards me.

351
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:46,100
<16-20,Melinda>为什么?
<16-20,Melinda>Why?

352
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,330
<16-21,Foreman>可以么?
<16-21,Foreman>Please?

353
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,570
<16-22,Melinda>感觉有点奇怪
<16-22,Melinda>It feels kind of weird.

354
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,140
<17-1,Foreman>这被称为跨阈步态
<17-1,Foreman>It's called steppage gait.

355
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,890
<17-2,Lewis>严重么?
<17-2,Lewis>is it serious?

356
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:02,410
<17-3,Foreman>不一定
<17-3,Foreman>Not necessarily.

357
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:05,080
<17-3,Foreman>好的,把你的腿伸出来,保持住
<17-3,Foreman>All right,stick your leg out,hold it up.

358
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:10,430
<17-4,Barbara>她还处在活检的麻醉中,如果考虑到她缺氧的话--
<17-4,Barbara>She was under anesthesia for the biopsy.If she lost oxygen--

359
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:12,390
<17-5,Foreman>C.T. 排除了脑损伤
<17-5,Foreman>C.T. Ruled out brain damage.

360
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:16,320
<17-5,Foreman>把腿放下吧.放松
<17-5,Foreman>Put your leg down.Relax.

361
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:21,550
<17-6,Barbara>为什么她的腿像那样抽搐?
<17-6,Barbara>Why is her leg twitching like that?

362
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:23,480
<17-7,Foreman>(肌肉 神经的)自发性收缩
<17-7,Foreman>Fasciculation.

363
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:24,860
<17-8,Lewis>严重么?
<17-8,Lewis>Is that serious?

364
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:28,170
<17-9,Foreman>这是麻痹,而且还在恶化
<17-9,Foreman>It's paralysis,and it's ascending.

365
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:32,140
<17-10,Barbara>她会失去她腿部的功能么?
<17-10,Barbara>She's going to lose the use of her legs?

366
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:36,700
<17-11,Foreman>这只是开始
<17-11,Foreman>To start with.

367
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:44,580
<18-1,Foreman>情况恶化的很快,她现在几乎不能伸腿了
<18-1,Foreman>it's ascending fast.She can hardly extend her leg now.

368
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:47,690
<18-2,Cameron>按照这种速度,大概几天后就会发展到她的肺了
<18-2,Cameron>At this rate,it'll be up to her lungs in a matter of days.

369
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:53,140
<18-3,House>看来,过敏性反应,心力衰竭,麻痹.
<18-3,House>So,anaphylaxis,heart failure,paralysis.

370
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:56,410
<18-3,House>前两个都不能归因到一起,我想三个都放到一起也不可能了
<18-3,House>Couldn't put the first two together.I'm guessing we can't put all three together.

371
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,700
<18-4,Cameron>蜱麻痹?
<18-4,Cameron>Tick paralysis?

372
00:22:57,770 --> 00:22:59,790
<18-4,Cameron>也可以解释过敏性反应,甚至也许--
<18-4,Cameron>Could also explain the anaphylaxis,maybe even the--

373
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:02,850
<18-5,Foreman>青霉素过敏对过敏性反应的解释要好的多
<18-5,Foreman>penicillin allergy explains the allergic reaction much better.

374
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:06,410
<18-6,Chase>具体的, 蜱麻痹需要有蜱才行
<18-6,Chase>particularly because tick paralysis is usually accompanied by a tick.

375
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:09,810
<18-6,Chase>我们做了两个详尽的身体检查,来查找昆虫叮咬
<18-6,Chase>We did two comprehensive physicals looking for insect bites.

376
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:11,940
<18-7,House>我们可以把任何其中两个归因到一起么?
<18-7,House>Can we put any two of those together?

377
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,770
<18-7,House>不如我们规定一下?
<18-7,House>How about we stipulate?

378
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,840
<18-8,Foreman>你说肯定有某样东西,把这三种症状联系到一起
<18-8,Foreman>You argued that there must be something to connect all three symptoms,

379
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:18,440
<18-8,Foreman>你嘲笑我们没有弄清楚是什么
<18-8,Foreman>you mocked us for not figuring it out,

380
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,080
<18-8,Foreman>而最后你又让我们单独讨论麻痹
<18-8,Foreman>and finally you let us discuss the paralysis on its own because

381
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,900
<18-8,Foreman>因为这才是要将她至于死地的
<18-8,Foreman>it's what's gonna kill her.

382
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:26,560
<18-8,Foreman>现在,它正在恶化.MRI没显示有问题,排除中风和动脉瘤
<18-8,Foreman>Now,it's ascending.Her mris are clean,so rule out stroke or aneurysm.

383
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,840
<18-10,Foreman>肌萎缩性侧索硬化?,多发性硬化? 进展太快了
<18-10,Foreman>als? Ms? Progression's too quick.

384
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,900
<18-11,Chase>白血病引起的脊椎损伤? 太慢了
<18-11,Chase>Spinal lesion from leukemia? Too slow.

385
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:32,280
<18-12,Foreman>最有可能的是古兰－巴雷综合症
<18-12,Foreman>It's most likely guillain-barre.

386
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,870
<18-13,Chase>她在服用免疫抑制剂,可能是肉毒杆菌中毒?
<18-13,Chase>She's immunosuppressed.What about botulism?

387
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:37,210
<18-14,Foreman>不可能,除非最后几天她倒立着走来走去
<18-14,Foreman>Not unless she's been walking around on her hands the last couple of days.

388
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,300
<18-14,Foreman>肉毒杆菌中毒引起的麻痹症状,是逐渐减轻的 不是恶化的
<18-14,Foreman>Botulism paralysis is descending,not ascending.

389
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:42,710
<18-15,Cameron>有可能西尼罗河热,甚至小儿麻痹,考虑到她免疫系统有问题
<18-15,Cameron>Could be a virus.West nile,even polio with her immune system shot.

390
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:45,700
<18-16,House>做个腰椎穿刺,做个pcrs来检查病毒
<18-16,House>Get an lp and do pcrs for the viruses.

391
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:48,340
<18-16,House>还有做一个肌电图来检查一下,古兰－巴雷综合症
<18-16,House>And get an emg to check for guillain-barre.

392
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:51,490
<18-16,House>Foreman说的没错,我们得找出为什么她出现麻痹症状
<18-16,House>Foreman's right. We gotta find out why she's paralyzed.

393
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:56,790
<18-16,House>但不是在这之前傻傻盯着我看几秒钟
<18-16,House>But not before staring at me dumbly for a few seconds.

394
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:09,640
<19-1,Foreman>我们对你女儿又做了一些测试
<19-1,Foreman>we ran more tests on your daughter.

395
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:12,830
<19-1,Foreman>我们做了一个腰椎穿刺,得到了一些脊髓液
<19-1,Foreman>We took a lumbar puncture,got some spinal fluid.

396
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:15,220
<19-1,Foreman>然后我们把她带到实验室,寻找是否有受到感染
<19-1,Foreman>Then we brought her to the lab to look for infections that

397
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:18,190
<19-1,Foreman>这种感染可能影响到她的大脑
<19-1,Foreman>could be affecting her brain.

398
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:22,270
<19-1,Foreman>我们也做了肌电图,检测她的肌肉和神经
<19-1,Foreman>We also did an emg to check how her muscles and nerves

399
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:25,120
<19-1,Foreman>如何对电脉冲做出反应
<19-1,Foreman>are responding to electrical impulses.

400
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:29,010
<19-1,Foreman>很不幸,她在膝盖以上的肌肉,显示越来越无力
<19-1,Foreman>Unfortunately,her muscles are showing increased weakness above the knee.

401
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:30,950
<19-2,Barbara>你是说她的情况变得更糟糕了么?
<19-2,Barbara>You mean she's getting worse?

402
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:33,950
<19-3,Foreman>腰椎穿刺和pcrs排除了,小儿麻痹症和西尼罗河热的可能
<19-3,Foreman>The lp and pcrs ruled out polio and west nile.

403
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,930
<19-3,Foreman>我们认为是古兰－巴雷综合症
<19-3,Foreman>We think it's guillain-barre.

404
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,140
<19-3,Foreman>身体的免疫响应出了毛病
<19-3,Foreman>The body's immune response goes haywire

405
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:40,270
<19-3,Foreman>开始攻击末稍神经
<19-3,Foreman>and starts attacking the peripheral nerves.

406
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:42,700
<19-3,Foreman>引起了肌肉无力和麻痹
<19-3,Foreman>It causes muscle weakness and paralysis.

407
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:44,580
<19-4,Lewis>情况有多糟糕?
<19-4,Lewis>How bad is it?

408
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:49,490
<19-5,Foreman>很严重 但是血浆置换法,通常对古兰－巴雷综合症疗效显著
<19-5,Foreman>It's serious,but guillain-barre usually responds very well to plasmapheresis.

409
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:57,710
<20-1,Foreman>你知道,血浆
<20-1,Foreman>you see,the plasma,

410
00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:00,680
<20-1,Foreman>她血液中的液体部分,包含了大部分的抗体
<20-1,Foreman>the clear liquid part of her blood,contains most of the antibodies,

411
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:03,530
<20-1,Foreman>这些抗体反应过度,攻击她的神经系统
<20-1,Foreman>which are overreacting and attacking her nervous system.

412
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,080
<20-1,Foreman>机器将她的血液在离心机中进行旋转
<20-1,Foreman>The machine spins her blood in a centrifuge

413
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:08,640
<20-1,Foreman>基于重量将她的血液各部分分离
<20-1,Foreman>and separates parts of the blood based on weight.

414
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,390
<20-1,Foreman>白血球是最重的
<20-1,Foreman>White blood cells are the heaviest,

415
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:13,060
<20-1,Foreman>然后是红血球,然后是血小板和血浆
<20-1,Foreman>then the red cells,then platelets and plasma.

416
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:15,210
<20-1,Foreman>我们丢掉引起问题的部分
<20-1,Foreman>We discard the stuff that's causing all the trouble

417
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,600
<20-1,Foreman>将有益的血细胞负载在替代液中,返送回她的身体
<20-1,Foreman>and return the good blood cells back to her body in a replacement fluid.

418
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:24,070
<20-1,Foreman>如果行的通,几天后我们就会看到结果
<20-1,Foreman>If it works,we'll see results in a couple of days.

419
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:32,820
<21-1,Wilson>上星期你没收到,给我的电话留言吧,是不是?
<21-1,Wilson>You didn't get any messages for me last week,did you?

420
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:33,940
<21-2,House>没
<21-2,House>Nope.

421
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:37,890
<21-3,Wilson>有意思了.那家伙最后打电话来了,我丢掉了那个住处
<21-3,Wilson>That's funny.The guy finally called back.The place I lost?

422
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,090
<21-3,Wilson>他说他留了三条语音信息
<21-3,Wilson>He said he left three voicemails.

423
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:41,050
<21-4,House>要尿尿
<21-4,House>Gotta pee.

424
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:45,110
<21-5,Wilson>三条我从来没有收到过的信息,如果说的还不够清楚
<21-5,Wilson>Which I never got,if that wasn't clear.

425
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:46,430
<21-6,House>他肯定在扯谎
<21-6,House>He must be lying.

426
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:48,540
<21-6,House>你不会想要和一个说谎的人住在一起的
<21-6,House>You wouldn't want to live with a liar.

427
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:51,030
<21-7,Wilson>你删了给我的留言?
<21-7,Wilson>You erased my messages?

428
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:54,400
<21-8,House>决定了我想要你留下来,跟你说过了，没有么?
<21-8,House>Decided I wanted you to stay.Told you that,didn't I?

429
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:58,840
<21-9,Wilson>你...可怜,又孤单一人,而你又要把我困在这里
<21-9,Wilson>You're...miserable,and you're lonely,and you're gonna trap me here

430
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:01,400
<21-9,Wilson>让我也完全和你一样可怜孤单
<21-9,Wilson>to keep me every bit as miserable and lonely,too.

431
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,700
<21-10,House>Yeah,你很快乐, 快乐, 快乐
<21-10,House>Yeah,and you're happy,happy,happy.

432
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:06,940
<21-11,Wilson>很明显我正在经历一段艰难的时间
<21-11,Wilson>Okay.Hey,I'm obviously going through a rough patch here.

433
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:10,670
<21-11,Wilson>妻子离去,要把某人轰走
<21-11,Wilson>Wife leaves,tends to bum somebody out.

434
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:13,610
<21-12,House>你知道我尿到哪里去了么?
<21-12,House>Do you know where my pee went?

435
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:17,340
<21-13,Wilson>你没有对准枪口?
<21-13,Wilson>You're missing some?

436
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:22,550
<21-14,House>不是.从我里面出来一路流向厕所,那么,怎么会这样?
<21-14,House>No. Came out of me and went right into the toilet.Now,why would that be?

437
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:26,100
<21-15,Wilson>你是William Tell(神箭手的名字),你可以从一个人的头上射下苹果?
<21-15,Wilson>You're william tell.You could pick an apple off someone's head?

438
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:29,100
<21-16,House>不,是因为厕所里面没有,塑料的包裹布铺在地上
<21-16,House>No,it's because there was no clear plastic wrap over the toilet.

439
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:32,510
<21-16,House>厨房里铺的那种东东,你有的是时间，缺的只是决心
<21-16,House>Stuff's in the kitchen.You have plenty of time.All that was missing was the will.

440
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:34,030
<21-17,Wilson>这里不是大学宿舍
<21-17,Wilson>This isn't a college dorm.

441
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:35,400
<21-18,House>可以是的
<21-18,House>It could be.

442
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,340
<21-19,Wilson>我们不是18岁了
<21-19,Wilson>We're not 18!

443
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,520
<21-20,House>那又怎样?
<21-20,House>So what?

444
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:39,730
<21-20,House>我对你做了什么?
<21-20,House>What did I do to you?

445
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,010

<21-25,Wilson>我不会剥夺你最后一次笑的机会
<21-25,Wilson>I wouldn't wanna deprive you of that last smile.

00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,320
<21-26,House>你哪里都不会去的
<21-26,House>You're not going anywhere.

455
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:08,500
<21-26,House>你会坐在我的沙发上,让我们俩都郁闷
<21-26,House>You're gonna sit on my couch,and depress us both,

456
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:10,700
<21-26,House>因为你不敢承认你和你老婆玩完了
<21-26,House>because you just can't admit that it's over with your wife.

457
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:12,530
<21-27,Wilson>没错.我是来这里度假的
<21-27,Wilson>That's right.I'm here on vacation.

<21-30,House>you even called one?

461
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:24,210
<21-30,House>只要你在这里,这就只是一场吵架
<21-30,House>As long as you're here,it's just a fight.

462
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:29,830
<21-30,House>你一找到一个地方,那么这就是离婚了
<21-30,House>As soon as you get a place,then it's a divorce.

463
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,800
<21-30,House>什么事都糟透了
<21-30,House>Everything sucks.

464

<21-30,House>还是可能找到一些可以让人去笑的东西
<21-30,House>Might as well find something to smile about.

<22-3,Foreman>有时需要几个疗程让血浆置换法见效
<22-3,Foreman>Sometimes it takes a few treatments for the plasmapheresis to work.

<22-4,Melinda>为什么这一切一直发生在我身上?
<22-4,Melinda>Why do these things keep happening to me?

<22-13,Foreman>我肯定她很疲惫了
<22-13,Foreman>I'm sure she's exhausted.

00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:11,590
<22-14,Barbara>她已经放弃了
<22-14,Barbara>she's given up.

00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:24,280
<22-14,Barbara>她总是和我争吵
<22-14,Barbara>She's always fought with me.

<22-14,Barbara>从她是一个婴孩开始,她就这么的顽固
<22-14,Barbara>Ever since she was a baby,she was so damn stubborn.

<22-14,Barbara>但是我从未想要她这样子
<22-14,Barbara>But I never wanted her like this.

<22-20,Chase>不是过敏.嘴唇发紫.我们得做插管了
<22-20,Chase>It's not an allergy.Lips are cyanotic.We got to intubate.

<22-24,Foreman>她得不到足够的氧气.我们得帮助她呼吸
<22-24,Foreman>She's not getting enough oxygen.We've got to assist her breathing.

<22-25,Barbara>这是怎么回事?是对治疗的反应么?
<22-25,Barbara>What was that?Was that a reaction to the treatment?

498

<23-5,House>Cuddy? 她管这个干什么?
<23-5,House>Cuddy? What's she doing on this?

506
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,760
<24-1,Foreman>可能是她中了神经毒剂
<24-1,Foreman>It's like she got poisoned with a nerve agent.

<24-6,House>这个女孩很倔.她得到她想要的
<24-6,House>This girl's tough.She gets what she wants.

513
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:22,360
<24-6,House>她被剥夺了和人接触的机会,她就会给自己找一个秘密的情人
<24-6,House>She's deprived of human contact,she gets herself a backdoor man.

514
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:24,530
<24-6,House>或者说对于她的情况,一个爬边窗进来的男孩
<24-6,House>Or in her case,a side window boy.

<24-9,Foreman>This is paralysis is ascending,remember?

520
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:37,590
<24-10,House>如果她心脏的问题是她麻痹的真正原因,就不是这样了
<24-10,House>Not if the heart problem's really a paralytic problem.

521
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,570
<24-11,Cameron>她为什么会承认性而不是食物?
<24-11,Cameron>Why would she admit the sex and not the food?

522
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,280
<24-12,Chase>她什么都没有承认
<24-12,Chase>She didn't admit anything.

555
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:04,290
<25-12,House>结果是danny的小danny上都是青霉素
<25-12,House>Turns out that danny's little danny is full of penicillin.

556
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,150
<25-12,House>这是导致你过敏性休克的原因
<25-12,House>That's what caused your anaphylactic shock.

557
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:08,620
<25-13,Barbara>你没有告诉我们是这个--
<25-13,Barbara>You didn't tell us that's what--

558
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:14,350
<25-14,Melinda>不. 是--他服用了氯洁霉素,是我在用的
<25-14,Melinda>no. It was--he took clindamycin.What I use.

559
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:18,040
<25-15,House>他说他正在服用青霉素
<25-15,House>He said he was on penicillin.

560
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,600
<25-16,Melinda>我看到瓶子了
<25-16,Melinda>I saw the bottle.

561
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,410
<25-17,Foreman>这是非青霉素类的抗生素
<25-17,Foreman>It's a non-penicillin antibiotic.

562
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:24,270
<25-18,House>如果抗生素没有引起过敏性反应的话
<25-18,House>If the antibiotics didn't cause the anaphylaxis...

563
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:26,040
<25-19,Foreman>问题还在
<25-19,Foreman>it's still on the table.

564
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:27,720
<25-20,House>一切都关联起来了
<25-20,House>Everything is connected.

565
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:29,780
<25-21,Foreman>我们在讨论什么?有什么区别么?
<25-21,Foreman>What did we discuss?What was the differential?

566
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,180
<25-22,House>Cameron说过...
<25-22,House>Cameron said...

567
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:37,510
<25-22,House>当dan那天晚上到你房子里,他有穿过一片高草么?
<25-22,House>when dan came to your house that night,did he go through any tall grass?

568
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:39,850
<25-23,Melinda>爬过一片篱笆
<25-23,Melinda>Climbed a fence.

569
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:46,500
<25-24,Barbara>你在干什么?
<25-24,Barbara>What are you doing?

570
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:48,520
<25-25,House>周五晚上你的女儿有两位访客
<25-25,House>Your daughter had two visitors on friday night.

571
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:50,110
<25-25,House>其中之一还在这个屋子里面
<25-25,House>One of them is still in the room.

572
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:53,610
<25-25,House>她有壁虱性麻痹
<25-25,House>She has tick paralysis.

573
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,910
<25-25,House>Dan在他的牛仔裤上带上了扁虱
<25-25,House>Dan tracked a tick onto his jeans,

574
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:59,570
<25-25,House>这本不会是一个问题,但是作为一个年轻人
<25-25,House>which wouldn't be a problem.But being a teenager,

575
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,000
<25-25,House>dan不能把他的扁虱保留在他的裤子上
<25-25,House>dan couldn't keep his tick in his pants.

576
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,980
<25-26,Foreman>我们已经检查过她了
<25-26,Foreman>we already checked her.

577
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:05,920
<25-27,House>现在我在检查她
<25-27,House>Now I'm checking her.

578
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:08,470
<25-28,Wilson>蜱叮咬通常不会引起过敏性休克
<25-28,Wilson>Tick bites don't ordinarily cause anaphylactic shock.

579
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:10,630
<25-29,House>这个女孩的过敏性是不同寻常的
<25-29,House>This girl's allergies are not ordinary.

580
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:14,110
<25-30,Cuddy>House,出去.我们要重新给,她插管,给她做MRI
<25-30,Cuddy>House,get out of here.We have to re-intubate her,get her into the mri.

581
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:15,490
<25-31,House>时间过程再符合不过了
<25-31,House>The time course is perfect.

582
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:18,030
<25-31,House>叮咬本身引发了过敏反应
<25-31,House>The bite itself sets off an allergic reaction.

583
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:22,000
<25-31,House>毒素花了四天发生作用,脆弱的心脏, 第一个中镖
<25-31,House>Venom takes four days to kick in,heart's vulnerable, hits that first,

584
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:24,320
<25-31,House>而一天以后引发了不断恶化的麻痹
<25-31,House>and a day later sets off the ascending paralysis.

585
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,340
<25-32,Cuddy>除了蜱通常不是看不到的
<25-32,Cuddy>Except that ticks aren't usually invisible.

586
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:28,460
<25-33,House>它们是不显眼的直到你找到它们
<25-33,House>They are until you find them.

587
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:33,630
<25-33,House>哦不,那是头皮屑.,那一点也不像我原来希望的那样有戏剧性
<25-33,House>Oh no,that's dandruff.That wasn't nearly as dramatic as I'd hoped.

588
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:36,490
<25-33,House>只是意味着下次情况会更好
<25-33,House>Just means the next time it'll be even better.

589
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,130
<25-34,Lewis>发生什么了?
<25-34,Lewis>What's happening?

590
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,920
<25-35,House>那是蜱的毒素让情况恶化了
<25-35,House>That's the tick venom ascending.

591
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:46,840
<25-36,Cuddy>或者是这种情况或者你让她心力衰竭了,血压在降低.心率,47.
<25-36,Cuddy>Either that or you stressed her into heart failure.Bp's dropping.Heart rate,47.

592
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:48,050
<25-37,Foreman>我在注入阿托品
<25-37,Foreman>I'm administering atropine.

593
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,370
<25-38,Cuddy>她需要一次静脉导管了
<25-38,Cuddy>She's going to need a transvenous pacing wire.

594
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:54,330
<25-38,Cuddy>Okay,魔术师的搜寻结束了,现在是真材实料的医生的时间
<25-38,Cuddy>Okay,magical tick hunt is over.Only real doctor stuff now.

595
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,690
<25-38,Cuddy>这只会变得更加糟糕
<25-38,Cuddy>This is just gonna get worse.

596
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:59,120
<25-39,House>蜱得到养分的时间越久,它产生的毒素就越多
<25-39,House>Ticks produce more toxins the longer they feed.

597
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:02,390
<25-39,House>她一个小时以后就会死了,即使你往她的心脏加满喷气机燃料
<25-39,House>She's gonna be dead in an hour even if you pump her heart full of jet fuel,

598
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:04,360
<25-39,House>除非你们让我找到蜱
<25-39,House>unless you let me find the tick.

599
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,280
<25-40,Barbara>他会是对的么?
<25-40,Barbara>Could he be right?

600
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,570
<25-41,Cuddy>我唯一确定的是你女儿的心脏
<25-41,Cuddy>The only thing I know for sure is that your daughter's heart

601
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,800
<25-41,Cuddy>不会再挺过20分钟如果得不到治疗的话
<25-41,Cuddy>won't last another 20 minutes without treatment.

602
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:11,610
<25-42,House>Okay,我只需要一个最后的建议
<25-42,House>Okay,I just need one final instruction.

603
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:14,450
<25-42,House>当我尸检的时候发现蜱,你还要不要知道?
<25-42,House>When I find the tick on the autopsy,do you want to know?

604
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,980
<25-42,House>不要知道 可能让你们,心理上的处理更容易一些
<25-42,House>I'm thinking not.Probably make the coping easier.

605
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,330
<25-43,Cuddy>不要再跟他们说话了!
<25-43,Cuddy>Stop talking to them!

606
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:21,190
<25-43,Cuddy>呼心脏病科的borsisky,让她的小组到这里
<25-43,Cuddy>Page borsisky in cardiology.Get her team down here stat.

607
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,910
<25-43,Cuddy>让他们出去.也把House弄出去
<25-43,Cuddy>Get them out of here.Get house out of here,too.

608
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:25,440
<25-43,Cuddy>Wilson医生,我可能用的上你的帮忙
<25-43,Cuddy>Dr. Wilson,I could use your help.

609
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:28,360
<25-44,Wilson>Well,我不知道多巴胺是否足够
<25-44,Wilson>Well,I don't know if the dopamine's enough.

610
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,210
<25-44,Wilson>--她也许需要乳酸氨力农,--为什么? 那是什么?
<25-44,Wilson>--She may need inamrinone lactate. --Why? What's that?

611
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,290
<25-47,Wilson>她不需要--她也许需要更强的血管收缩剂
<25-47,Wilson>She doesn't--she might need stronger pressors.

612
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:34,930
<25-47,Wilson>而放射科一点这个都没有
<25-47,Wilson>They don't have any in radiology.

613
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,170
<25-48,Cuddy>乳酸氨力农可能引起,心律不齐与血小板减少
<25-48,Cuddy>Inamrinone can cause arrhythmia and thrombocytopenia.

614
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:41,480
<25-49,Wilson>不用乳酸氨力农可能导致死亡,死亡更糟糕
<25-49,Wilson>Not inamrinone could cause death.Death's worse.

615
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:44,290
<25-49,Wilson>我们需要把她弄到重点护理病房
<25-49,Wilson>We have to get her up to the icu.

616
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:00,200
<26-1,House>抱歉.这里有点挤
<26-1,House>Sorry.Little crowded here.

617
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:01,630
<26-2,Cuddy>House,从电梯里面出来
<26-2,Cuddy>House,get out of the elevator.

618
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,350
<26-3,House>很欢迎你们等下一部
<26-3,House>You're welcome to wait for the next one.

619
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:05,540
<26-4,Cuddy>你护的住她吧?护的住
<26-4,Cuddy>You got her?Got her.

620
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:18,250
<26-6,House>Well,只要我们被困在这里
<26-6,House>Well,as long as we're stuck here,

621
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:20,460
<26-6,House>就会是一个找蜱的好机会
<26-6,House>this might be a good time to look for that tick.

622
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:21,930
<26-7,Foreman>把电梯重新开动
<26-7,Foreman>Turn the elevator back on.

623
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:23,190
<26-8,House>就等一会儿,亲爱的
<26-8,House>Just be a minute,honey.

624
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:33,510
<26-9,Foreman>阿托品的效果在减弱
<26-9,Foreman>Atropine's wearing off.

625
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:34,660
<26-10,House>那就再注射
<26-10,House>So inject her again.

626
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:35,690
<26-11,Foreman>那只是暂时有效
<26-11,Foreman>That's just temporary.

627
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,120
<26-12,House>暂时就够了,我们又不是在贴墙纸
<26-12,House>Temporary's fine.We're not hanging wallpaper.

628
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,630
<26-13,Foreman>我们得把她送到楼上给她使用去甲肾上腺素
<26-13,Foreman>We've got to get her upstairs and put her on norepinephrine.

629
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,830
<26-14,House>这不是青霉素的问题
<26-14,House>It wasn't penicillin.

630
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,190
<26-14,House>你还认为症状之间没有关联?
<26-14,House>You still think the symptoms are unconnected?

631
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:44,450
<26-15,Foreman>我们得先搞定她的心脏
<26-15,Foreman>We've got to take care of her heart before--

632
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:48,090
<26-16,House>你早上醒来,你的漆料都已剥落,门帘也不见了
<26-16,House>you wake up in the morning,your paint's peeling,your curtains are gone,

633
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:50,780
<26-16,House>还有水也开了,你先处理哪个问题?
<26-16,House>and the water's boiling.Which problem do you deal with first?

634
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:53,050
<26-18,House>什么都不是!大楼已经着火了!
<26-18,House>House--none of them!The building's on fire!

635
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:55,960
<26-18,House>我们对症治疗,她死定了,我们找出病因,她会活下来
<26-18,House>We treat her symptoms,she dies.We find the cause,she lives.

636
00:36:56,070 --> 00:37:00,460
<26-18,House>蜱一直往静脉里面注入毒素,我们除掉它,她就会没事的
<26-18,House>That tick is an I.V. Drip of poison.We unhook it,she'll be fine.

637
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:10,120
<26-19,Foreman>这是我最后一支阿托品
<26-19,Foreman>It's my last atropine.

638
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:12,550
<26-19,Foreman>可以给我们大约三分钟
<26-19,Foreman>Last us about three minutes.

639
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,990
<26-20,House>我们把她的袍子翻开
<26-20,House>Let's get her gown up.

640
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:26,770
<26-21,Foreman>她的心率降到35以下,我们就把她送到重点护理病房
<26-21,Foreman>Her heart rate falls below 35,we're getting her to the icu.

641
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:29,740
<26-21,Foreman>我不会让她死在电梯里面的
<26-21,Foreman>I'm not gonna let her die in this elevator.

642
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:36,190
<27-1,Lewis>他们在哪里?
<27-1,Lewis>Where are they?

643
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:39,450
<27-2,Cuddy>让设备维护小组马上到这里来
<27-2,Cuddy>Get maintenance up here right away.

644
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:42,580
<27-3,Foreman>--耳道没有问题. --左腿没有问题
<27-3,Foreman>--Ear canal's clean. --Left foot's clean.

645
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:44,390
<27-5,Foreman>如果它不在这里,我们只有在--
<27-5,Foreman>If it's not here,we've only got--

646
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:46,840
<27-5,Foreman>心率46.
<27-5,Foreman>Heart rate's 46.

647
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:50,420
<27-6,House>在这里.就像一颗痣或者一个斑点,有时被我们漏过了
<27-6,House>It's here.Looks like a mole or a freckle.Something we missed.

648
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:52,830
<27-6,House>检查腋窝
<27-6,House>Check the armpits.

649
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:59,540
<27-7,Cuddy>Foreman是一个很出色的医生,他能够处理这个状况
<27-7,Cuddy>Dr di blane .is a excellent doctor.He's able to handle it.

650
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:01,060
<27-8,Lewis>你知道我对这个经历感觉怎样?
<27-8,Lewis>You know how i feel the experience?

651
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,790
<27-8,Lewis>你有很多病人在电梯里面死掉?
<27-8,Lewis>you lose a lot of patients on elevators?

652
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:04,610
<27-9,Barbara>维护人员说电梯不是自己停下来的
<27-9,Barbara>The maintenance guy said it didn't just stop on its own,

653
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:07,080
<27-9,Barbara>而是他们按下了紧急停止的按钮
<27-9,Barbara>that they hit the emergency stop button.

654
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:10,990
<27-10,Cuddy>Well,我肯定我们是弄错了
<27-10,Cuddy>Well,I'm sure us mistaken.

655
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:14,190
<27-11,House>会阴.我们检查过了
<27-11,House>Perineum.We checked it.

656
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:17,450
<27-12,Foreman>如果我们把她送到楼上--, --上颌.检查过了
<27-12,Foreman>If we get her upstairs-- --maxilla.Checked.

657
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:21,070
<27-14,Foreman>降到38了
<27-14,Foreman>Down to 38.

658
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:22,240
<27-14,Foreman>我们没有太多的时间了
<27-14,Foreman>We don't have a lot of time.

659
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:25,160
<27-15,House>眉毛,耳鼓,阴毛
<27-15,House>Eyebrows,eardrums,pubic hair.

660
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:26,190
<27-16,Foreman>检查了,检查了,检查了
