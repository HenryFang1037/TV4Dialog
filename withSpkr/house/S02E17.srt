00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:11,220
<1-2,Teacher>这里的血液是深紫色的
<1-2,Teacher>At this point,your blood is a deep purple.

3
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:16,450
<1-2,Teacher>因为氧气刚刚被释放到身体各个部位
<1-2,Teacher>Because it's just finished dropping off oxygen for all the parts of your body.

8
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:32,560
<1-4,Teacher>你想先做哪样?
<1-4,Teacher>Which would you like to do first?

9
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:33,920
<1-5,Ian>问题
<1-5,Ian>The question.

10
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:34,530
<1-6,Teacher>好的
<1-6,Teacher>Okay.

11
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:36,350
<1-7,Ian>厕所在哪?
<1-7,Ian>Where's the bathroom?

12
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:38,830
<1-8,Teacher>谁知道厕所在哪?
<1-8,Teacher>Who knows where the bathroom is?

13

00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,910
<1-11,Mike>我不用上厕所
<1-11,Mike>I don't have to go.

16
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:45,220
<1-12,Teacher>我们不是在学校, 不能单独行动
<1-12,Teacher>We're not at school.Nobody goes anywhere by themselves.

17
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:46,120
<1-13,Mike>为什么?
<1-13,Mike>Why?

18
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,170
<1-14,Teacher>为防止走失
<1-14,Teacher>In case you get lost.

19
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,920
<1-15,Ian>或者有人绑架我们
<1-15,Ian>Or in case somebody kidnaps us.

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,150
<1-16,Mike>如果有人绑架ian, 顺便就把我绑了,我想和大家在一起
<1-16,Mike>If somebody kidnaps ian,they'll kidnap me too.I want to stay with the class.

21
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:54,660
<1-17,Teacher>Michael, 陪ian去...
<1-17,Teacher>Michael,go with ian--

22
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,380

23
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,980
<1-19,Teacher>去帮我找个大人
<1-19,Teacher>I need you to find a grown-up.

24
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,740
<1-20,Ian>小孩要出来了?
<1-20,Ian>Is the baby coming?

25
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:01,560
<1-20,Ian>谁陪我一起去?
<1-20,Ian>Who should I take with me?

26
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,090
<1-21,Teacher>你没问题的, 到前台,或者找警卫来
<1-21,Teacher>You're fine.Go to the front desk,or--or find a security guard.

27
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:06,800
<1-22,Ian>我要尿尿
<1-22,Ian>I really have to pee.

28
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:09,910
<1-23,Teacher>上帝
<1-23,Teacher>God.

29
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:13,940
<1-24,Ian>是小孩要出来吗? 我不知道怎么办
<1-24,Ian>Is--is the baby coming?I don't know how to do this.

30
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:15,420
<1-25,Teacher>你没事吧, ian?
<1-25,Teacher>Are you okay,ian?

31
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:17,230
<1-26,Ian>我没事
<1-26,Ian>Yeah,sure.

32
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:26,430
<1-27,Teacher>我不这么觉得, 你在流血
<1-27,Teacher>I don't think you are.You're bleeding.

33
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:31,210
<1-27,Teacher>来人!
<1-27,Teacher>Help!

34
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:30,210
<2-1,Wilson>20块
<2-1,Wilson>20.

35
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,530
<2-2,Cuddy>跟
<2-2,Cuddy>Call.

36
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,450
<2-3,House>什么你都敢跟
<2-3,House>You'll call anything.

37
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,770
<2-4,Cuddy>我的筹码多过你
<2-4,Cuddy>My stack is bigger than your stack.

38
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,370
<2-4,Cuddy>跟不跟吧?
<2-4,Cuddy>You in or out?

39
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:43,240
<2-5,House>按照相对体积来说,大猩猩的睾丸小于人类
<2-5,House>You know that relative to their size,gorillas have smaller testicles than humans.

40
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:47,370
<2-6,Cuddy>你也许可以大过猩猩,但大不过我
<2-6,Cuddy>well,then you'd probably have an edge over a gorilla.But not over me.

41
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:53,700
<2-7,House>灵长类的相对睾丸大小,与其对雌性的忠诚是负相关的
<2-7,House>The reason is,primate teste size inversely corresponds to the fidelity of our females.

42
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:57,780
<2-8,Wilson>不要老拿我老婆的事呕我好不好?
<2-8,Wilson>Do you think there might be a better time to annoy me about myife?

43
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,290
<2-9,House>- 我说的是扑克,- 没错
<2-9,House>- I'm talking about poker.,- Right.

44
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:03,670
<2-11,Cuddy>女人是魔鬼, 你赶走女人是明智的,跟, 扣牌还是加注, 不要废话
<2-11,Cuddy>Women are evil.You're right to drive them away.Call,fold,or raise.Story time can wait.

45
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,980
<2-12,House>我们比黑猩猩稍小一些,所以我们更忠诚
<2-12,House>We're smaller and better than chimps,

46
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,770
<2-12,House>比大猩猩更大更花心
<2-12,House>bigger and worse than gorillas.

47
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:13,420
<2-12,House>我们的理性,把忠诚和信任置于最高境界
<2-12,House>For all our rationality,supposed trust and fealty to a higher power,

48
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:17,480
<2-12,House>创造出规则和法律
<2-12,House>our ability to create a system of rules and laws,

49
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:20,800
<2-12,House>但是原始冲动大于所有的规则
<2-12,House>our baser drives are more powerful than any of that.

50
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:24,290
<2-12,House>我们想控制情感, 但做不到
<2-12,House>We want to control our emotions,but we can'T.

51
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,550
<2-12,House>如果我们快活, 那就没什么
<2-12,House>If we're happy,things don't annoy us.

52
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:31,090
<2-12,House>但另一方面, 如果我们拿到一手烂牌
<2-12,House>If,on the other hand,we're sitting on crappy hole cards,

53
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:35,160
<2-12,House>一点小事能让我们大为烦恼
<2-12,House>little tiny things annoy us a whole lot more.

54
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,990
<2-13,Wilson>加注
<2-13,Wilson>I raise.

55
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,570
<2-13,Wilson>每次我加注都要跟我讲个烦人的故事?
<2-13,Wilson>So are you going to tell me an annoying story every time I raise?

56
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,540
<2-14,House>那就太过分了
<2-14,House>God,that would be annoying.

57
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:46,850
<2-15,Cuddy>我跟
<2-15,Cuddy>I call.

58
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:51,160
<2-16,Dr Wells>Cuddy医生? 有位病人在急诊室,Ian alston, 6岁
<2-16,Dr Wells>Dr. Cuddy?Got one of your patients in the E.R.Ian alston.Six years old.

59
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,960
<2-17,Cuddy>噢, 我认识他, 什么问题?,我全押
<2-17,Cuddy>oh,I know him.What's the problem?I'm all in.

60
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,070
<2-17,Cuddy>泻血
<2-17,Cuddy>Bloody diarrhea,

61
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:58,120
<2-18,Dr Wells>血行动力稳定, 不过肢体协调有问题
<2-18,Dr Wells>hemodynamically stable,but he's been developing some coordination problems.

62
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:00,350
<2-19,Cuddy>好像是肠胃炎和脱水
<2-19,Cuddy>It sounds like gastroenteritis and dehydration.

63
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,540
<2-19,Cuddy>先给他输液,我返班的时候处理
<2-19,Cuddy>Order fluids,and I'll take it on my service.

64
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,910
<2-19,Cuddy>就看你了, House
<2-19,Cuddy>Bet's to you,house.

65
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:04,730
<2-20,House>做过头部扫描了?
<2-20,House>They scan his head?

66
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,640
<2-21,Dr Wells>- 没有, 为什么要扫...,- 别玩花样, 跟不跟?
<2-21,Dr Wells>No,why would they scan--don't play games.You gonna call?

67
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,780
<2-23,House>心率怎么样?
<2-23,House>How's the heart rate?

68
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:09,870
<2-24,Dr Wells>稳定
<2-24,Dr Wells>Stable.

69
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,270
<2-25,Cuddy>不好意思
<2-25,Cuddy>I'm sorry.

70
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:14,820
<2-25,Cuddy>House? 是肠胃炎,我不会走开的
<2-25,Cuddy>House?It's gastroenteritis.I'm not going anywhere.

71
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:18,870
<2-25,Cuddy>先输液, 让人告诉alan和sarah,我这边一完事就上去
<2-25,Cuddy>Put the order in,and have someone tell alan and sarah that I'll be up when I'm done.

72
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:21,990
<2-25,Cuddy>你跟不跟?
<2-25,Cuddy>You in or out?

73
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,450
<2-26,House>不跟
<2-26,House>I'm out.

74
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:32,460
<2-27,Cuddy>完美的唬牌
<2-27,Cuddy>stone cold bluff.

75
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:36,320
<2-27,Cuddy>你要多注意你的牌
<2-27,Cuddy>You might want to spend a little more time paying attention to your cards,

76
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:39,340
<2-27,Cuddy>而不是盯着我的胸部
<2-27,Cuddy>and a little less time staring at my breasts.

77
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:40,820
<2-28,House>它们也不成对
<2-28,House>They don't match,either.

78
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:43,220
<2-28,House>我出去喘喘气
<2-28,House>I'm going to take some air.

79
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,620
<3-1,House>眼睛看我的手指
<3-1,House>Follow my finger with your eyes.

80
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,310
<3-2,Sarah>Cuddy医生什么时候会到?
<3-2,Sarah>How much longer will dr. Cuddy be?

81
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:16,740
<3-3,House>从她在聚会上喝的mojitos酒的数量看
<3-3,House>Well,given the number of mojitos she's knocking back at the party,

82
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:20,400
<3-3,House>她还要3小时才能回复清醒
<3-3,House>I'd say it's gonna be at least three hours before she's even conscious.

83
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,320
<3-4,Sarah>你也去了那个聚会?
<3-4,Sarah>weren't you at the same party?

84
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:24,330
<3-5,House>我不喝酒
<3-5,House>I don't drink.

85
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:29,000
<3-5,House>伸手抓我的拐杖
<3-5,House>I want you to reach out and grab my cane.

86
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:35,750
<3-6,Alan>什么问题?
<3-6,Alan>What's wrong?

87
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:38,900
<3-7,House>你儿子的大脑失去对肌肉的控制了
<3-7,House>Your son's brain is losing control of his muscles.

88
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,630
<3-8,Sarah>Cuddy医生说是腹泻造成的脱水
<3-8,Sarah>Dr. Cuddy's message said it was just dehydration from the diarrhea.

89
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,580
<3-9,House>她错了
<3-9,House>She's wrong.

90
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,810
<3-10,Alan>他会好的吧?
<3-10,Alan>Is he going to be all right?

91
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,760
<3-11,House>不知道
<3-11,House>I don't know.

92
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,260
<4-1,Woman>你在那笼子里待过?
<4-1,Woman>So were you in one of those cages?

93
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:25,490
<4-1,Woman>没
<4-1,Woman>No.

94
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,360
<4-2,Chase>没没没,  笼子是给游客的
<4-2,Chase>No,no,no.Those are for tourists.

95
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,870
<4-3,Woman>你和一条大白鲨在水里
<4-3,Woman>You were in the water with a great white.

96
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:34,670
<4-4,Chase>当然, 这有什么,注意观察就好了
<4-4,Chase>Sure.It's no big deal.You just have to keep an eye on them.

97
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:38,210
<4-4,Chase>如果它们太靠近,打它的鼻子
<4-4,Chase>If they get too close,punch 'em in the nose.

98
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,380
<4-4,Chase>打跑了就没事
<4-4,Chase>Send them on their way.

99
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:42,910
<4-4,Chase>你信了
<4-4,Chase>I had you going.

100
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:44,760
<4-5,Woman>坏小子
<4-5,Woman>You are mean.

101
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,630
<4-6,House>你的肛裂怎么样了?
<4-6,House>Hey,how's that anal fissure?

102
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,120
<4-6,House>治好了? 还是仍在漏水?
<4-6,House>Did it heal yet,or is it still draining?

103
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:53,270
<4-6,House>不好意思,我以为你不会回来了
<4-6,House>Oh,I'm sorry.I didn't realize you came back for seconds.

104
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:56,390
<4-6,House>我以为楼梯间的那个女孩,够你今晚享受了
<4-6,House>I figured that after that girl in the stairwell,you'd be done for the night.

105
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,790
<4-7,Chase>他开玩笑
<4-7,Chase>He's joking.

106
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:01,920
<4-8,House>没有喉结, 手也小,这次应该是货真价实的了
<4-8,House>No adam's apple,small hands.It's no surprises this time.

107
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,330
<4-9,Woman>迟点见
<4-9,Woman>I'll,see you later.

108
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,940
<4-10,House>有个病例
<4-10,House>Got a case.

109
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,850
<4-11,Chase>你可以直接说, 不用给我捣乱
<4-11,Chase>Well,you could've just said that.You didn't have to screw with me.

110
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,670
<4-12,House>如果我不捣乱,你整晚都会惦记着上床
<4-12,House>but if I didn't screw with you,you'd spend the whole night thinking you might get laid.

111
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,780
<4-12,House>那样的你是无用的,还不如掐断你的希望
<4-12,House>Which means you'd be useless.Better to extinguish all hope.

112
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:20,130
<4-12,House>马上找foreman和cameron,到楼上找我
<4-12,House>Get foreman and cameron and meet me upstairs,stat.

113
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:26,340
<5-1,Chase>什么事这么急?

114
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:29,550
<5-2,House>两个病例, 相同症状
<5-2,House>Two cases,same symptoms.

115
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:33,470
<5-2,House>6岁和70岁有什么相同点?
<5-2,House>What do 6-year-olds and 70-year-olds have in common?

116
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:36,000
<5-3,Cameron>免疫系统都很差,可能是李氏杆菌病
<5-3,Cameron>Their immune systems don't work as well.Could be listeria.

117
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,290
<5-4,House>已经查过了
<5-4,House>Already checked for that.

118
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,760
<5-5,Foreman>白血病在两者都高发
<5-5,Foreman>Leukemia has a higher prevalence in both the young and old.

119
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,220
<5-6,Cameron>哮喘也是
<5-6,Cameron>So does asthma.

120
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:42,500
<5-7,House>不不不
<5-7,House>no,no,no.

121
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:44,110
<5-8,Cameron>都能得糖尿病
<5-8,Cameron>they can both get diabetes.

122
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:46,270
<5-7,House>不
<5-7,House>No.

123
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:50,410
<5-9,House>将死之人和新生之人有很多共同点
<5-9,House>The nearly dead and the newly bred have more in common

124
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:52,970
<5-9,House>不同于青壮年
<5-9,House>with each other than with people in the middle.

125
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,630
<5-9,House>诡异
<5-9,House>It's weird.

126
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,520
<5-9,House>仿佛生命的循环
<5-9,House>Some kind of circle of life thing.

127
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:58,650
<5-10,Foreman>这个小孩没有肾衰竭
<5-10,Foreman>This kid doesn't have kidney failure.

128
00:07:58,730 --> 00:07:59,480
<5-11,House>会有的
<5-11,House>He will.

129
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,030
<5-12,Foreman>根据病历, 孩子只是吃坏了,老妇人也是--
<5-12,Foreman>Based on this file,the kid just ate some bad food.Was the old man--

130
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:06,820
<5-13,House>这两人相距很远, 不论时间或空间
<5-13,House>they were nowhere near each other in any of the four dimensions.

131
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:09,460
<5-14,Cameron>这个病例是12年前的
<5-14,Cameron>This case is 12 years old.

132
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:11,530
<5-16,Foreman>而这个是Cuddy的病人
<5-16,Foreman>And this case is cuddy'S.

133
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,850
<5-17,House>她转交给我
<5-17,House>She assigned it to me.

134
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:16,760
<5-18,Chase>她同意你的判断?,认为这不是肠胃炎?
<5-18,Chase>She agrees with you that this is something more than gastroenteritis?

135
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,530
<5-19,House>她要不同意我就不会转给我, 对吗?
<5-19,House>She wouldn't have assigned it to me if she didn't, would she?

136
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,010
<5-20,House>我们在说什么?
<5-20,House>What were we talking about?

137
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,560
<5-21,Chase>两个病人, 各有两个症状相似
<5-21,Chase>Two patients with two symptoms in common.

138
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,230
<5-21,Chase>且有5个症状不相似
<5-21,Chase>And five symptoms not in common.

139
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:36,940
<5-22,House>你们还穿开裆裤的时候
<5-22,House>While you were all wearing your "frankie says relax" t-shirts,

140
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:41,350
<5-22,House>我在治疗这位73岁老妇,她经历了如下症状--
<5-22,House>I was treating a 73-year-old woman who went through this progression of symptoms.

141
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,600
<5-22,House>最后的一项...
<5-22,House>The last of which was...

142
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:45,780
<5-22,House>死亡
<5-22,House>"Death"

143
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:50,590
<5-22,House>不知道你们在医学院学过没有,这项是不可治疗的
<5-22,House>in case any of you missed that class in med school,that one's untreatable.

144
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,150
<5-22,House>小孩有了前两项
<5-22,House>Kid's got the first two.

145
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:55,800
<5-22,House>Esther在1小时20分钟后,发展到第三项
<5-22,House>Took esther an hour and 20 minutes to go from two to three.

146
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,070
<5-22,House>一天之内将抵达终点
<5-22,House>And less than a day to make it all the way to the rear exit.

147
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:02,610
<5-23,Chase>只是因为这孩子腹泻有血?
<5-23,Chase>This is all because a child has some blood in his diarrhea.

148
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,070
<5-23,Chase>他肚子疼
<5-23,Chase>He's got a tummy ache.

149
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:07,390
<5-23,Chase>如果有丝毫理由支持坏的一面,cuddy必会全力以赴
<5-23,Chase>If there was any reason to think ithonything worse,cuddy would be all over it.

150
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:09,500
<5-24,House>那好, 做个结肠镜
<5-24,House>Great.Do a colonoscopy.

151
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:12,090
<5-25,Cameron>对一个很可能只是吃坏了的6岁小孩?
<5-25,Cameron>On a six-year-old kid who probably has nothing worse than some food poisoning?

152
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:15,890
<5-26,House>如果发现紫色丘疹,给我切一片下来
<5-26,House>If you happen to find any purple papules,do me a favor and grab a slice.

153
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:17,830
<5-26,House>我要检查Erdheim-chester病
<5-26,House>I want to check for erdheim chester.

154
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:22,640
<5-27,Chase>迄今为止只有200例的疾病?
<5-27,Chase>a disease that there have been what,maybe 200 reported cases of?Ever?

155
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,290
<5-28,House>如果Esther家人允许我验尸
<5-28,House>If esther's family had let me do an autopsy,

156
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,080
<5-28,House>那就是第201例
<5-28,House>there'd be 201.

157
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,220
<6-1,Foreman>发现什么?
<6-1,Foreman>see anything?

158
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,820
<6-2,Chase>没有, 没指望能发现什么
<6-2,Chase>no,and I don't expect to.

159
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:47,090
<6-3,Foreman>House通常不接病例
<6-3,Foreman>House usually avoids cases.

160
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,320
<6-3,Foreman>如果他从cuddy处偷病例,一定有原因
<6-3,Foreman>If he's actually stealing a case from cuddy,there's got to be a reason.

161
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:52,990
<6-3,Foreman>我不是第一次见这个病历
<6-3,Foreman>It's not the first time i've seen this file.

162
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:55,760
<6-4,Chase>cameron来这里之前一个月
<6-4,Chase>About a month before cameron was hired,

163
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:58,170
<6-4,Chase>几个卡车司机也有相同的症状
<6-4,Chase>some trucker came in here with these symptoms.

164
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,820
<6-4,Chase>House认为他死定了
<6-4,Chase>House decided he was dying.

165
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:04,450
<6-4,Chase>两天之内做了脊椎穿, 抽骨髓,三次结肠镜
<6-4,Chase>Two days and a spinal tap,bone marrow extraction,and three colonoscopies later,

166
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,650
<6-4,Chase>最后诊断为吃了变质起司三明治,开了些止疼药打发回家了
<6-4,Chase>we sent the guy home with a bunch of painkillers and a diagnosis of a bad cheese sandwich.

167
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,630
<6-4,Chase>有个以前在这里上班的人说
<6-4,Chase>One of the guys who worked here before me

168
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:15,480
<6-4,Chase>house至少有三次试图拯救esther
<6-4,Chase>said house tried to cure esther at least three other times.

169
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:20,000
<6-4,Chase>你知道有的人能从面包上看出圣母像?
<6-4,Chase>You know how people see the virgin mary in danishes and stuff?

170
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,670
<6-4,Chase>12年前死去的病人, House不知道原因
<6-4,Chase>Someone died 12 years ago,and house doesn't know why.

171
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:30,850
<6-4,Chase>这个病例一直萦绕在House的眼前,剥落的油漆里, 云彩里, 这个小孩身上
<6-4,Chase>House sees that case now in paint peeling,in clouds,and now in this poor kid.

172
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,430
<7-1,Cameron>Erdheim-chester病是,抗感染细胞的异常生长
<7-1,Cameron>Erdheim chester is an abnormal growth of some of the cells that fight infection.

173
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,640
<7-2,Sarah>是癌症么? 他现在看起来还好啊
<7-2,Sarah>Is that cancer?'Cause he seems okay now.

174
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,810
<7-3,Alan>另外那个医生吓死我们了
<7-3,Alan>Yeah,the other doctor kind of scared us about that.

175
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,140
<7-4,Cameron>没什么可怕的,只是做个测试, 估计结果是阴性
<7-4,Cameron>He shouldn't have.We're just testing.It'll probably be negative.

176
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,380
<7-5,Alan>不明白, 你们不觉得他有那个病,但还是--
<7-5,Alan>I don't understand.You don't think that's what it is,but you want to--

177
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:46,230
<7-5,Alan>还是要做这些测试?
<7-5,Alan>you want to do this thing to him anyway?

178
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:48,530
<7-7,Sarah>- 我们需要确定,- 没别的办法了吗?
<7-7,Sarah>--We need to be sure. --Isn't there any other way?

179
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,680
<7-8,Cameron>很快就好的
<7-8,Cameron>It shouldn't take long.

180
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:55,050
<8-1,Foreman>那些突起看着很像紫色丘疹
<8-1,Foreman>Those ridges look a lot like purple papules.

181
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,820
<8-2,Chase>这不是紫色的, 是红色,很可能只是血疱
<8-2,Chase>They're not purple,they're red.They're probably just blood blisters.

182
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:04,010
<8-3,Foreman>把活检针给我
<8-3,Foreman>Give me the biopsy needle.

183
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,670
<9-1,Chase>这要花多长时间?
<9-1,Chase>How long is this going to take?

184
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:19,300
<9-2,Cameron>算了, chase, "打跑鲨鱼"的故事虽然精彩,但她不会等你的
<9-2,Cameron>Forget it,chase.Your punching-out-the-shark story's good,but she's not waiting for you.

185
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,410
<9-3,House>所以?
<9-3,House>So?

186
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:22,950
<9-3,House>我们不能确认出血的原因
<9-3,House>We couldn't confirm the source of the bleeding.

187
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:25,370
<9-4,Foreman>但我们检出一些血疱
<9-4,Foreman>But we did biopsy some--blood blisters.

188
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:26,880
<9-5,Chase>你是说丘疹
<9-5,Chase>You mean papules.

189
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:29,570
<9-6,House>快点cameron, 谁是对的?
<9-6,House>Come on,cameron.Who's right?

190
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:33,520
<9-7,Cameron>Chase对了, 不是Erdheim-chester病
<9-7,Cameron>Chase is.Negative for erdheim chester.

191
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,370
<9-8,House>我看看
<9-8,House>Let me see.

192
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
<9-8,House>- 如果不是Erdheim-chester病,- 就是我们之前说的
<9-8,House>If it's not erdheim chester-- it's exactly what we said before.

193
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:49,430
<9-9,Chase>普通的病毒性肠胃炎,我们可以回那个派对吗?
<9-9,Chase>Garden variety viral gastroenteritis.Can we go back to the party?

194
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,830
<9-10,House>做一次肾脏活检
<9-10,House>Do a kidney biopsy.

195
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:54,160
<9-10,House>Esther的肾脏停止-
<9-10,House>Esther's shut down in exactly--

196
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,820
<9-11,Chase>这孩子不是Esther
<9-11,Chase>this kid is not esther.

197
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:59,770
<9-11,Chase>你搞砸了, 她死了, 我很遗憾,不表示这孩子也要死
<9-11,Chase>You screwed up,she died.I'm sorry.But that does not mean this kid is dying as well.

198
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:04,800
<9-12,House>哇, 没泡到妞就这么怒,来吧
<9-12,House>Jeez.You get testy when you don't get any fuzz.Come on.

199
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,760
<10-1,Sarah>测试结果怎样?
<10-1,Sarah>What did the test say?

200
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,350
<10-2,Chase>结肠镜正常
<10-2,Chase>colonoscopy was clean.

201
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,960
<10-2,Chase>活检排除了Erdheim-chester病
<10-2,Chase>And the biopsy was negative for erdheim chester.

202
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,890
<10-3,Alan>这么说Ian会好的,只是病毒感染
<10-3,Alan>so ian's going to be all right.It was just some sort of virus.

203
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:28,890
<10-4,Sarah>这怎么了?
<10-4,Sarah>What's that?

204
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,170
<10-5,House>尿
<10-5,House>Urine.

205
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:33,450
<10-6,Alan>是褐色的
<10-6,Alan>But it's brown.

206
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,360
<10-7,Chase>Ian的肾脏失去功能了
<10-7,Chase>Ian's kidneys are shutting down.

207
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:39,100
<10-8,House>还说不是同个病?
<10-8,House>Still think it's not the same case?

208
00:12:54,050 --> 00:13:00,440
<11-1,House>什么病导致泻血, 共济失调和肾衰竭?
<11-1,House>so,what can cause bloody diarrhea,ataxia,and kidney failure?

209
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,880
<11-2,Chase>做活组织检查
<11-2,Chase>I'll go do a biopsy.

210
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,900
<11-3,House>不必了
<11-3,House>forget it.That battle's over.

211
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:08,450
<11-3,House>不断上升的肌酐等于是说,"和你的肾拜拜吧"
<11-3,House>His rising creatinine is his kidneys' way of saying,"go on without me."

212
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,920
<11-3,House>其它症状怎么解释?
<11-3,House>What explains everything?

213
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:18,380
<11-4,Chase>O-157大肠杆菌可以导致泻血,并导致溶血性尿毒症
<11-4,Chase>E. Coli ho:157 causes bloody diarrhea and leads to hemolytic uremic syndrome.

214
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:20,950
<11-4,Chase>细菌释放的毒素导致肾功能失常
<11-4,Chase>Toxins from the bacteria cause his kidneys to shut down.

215
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,690
<11-4,Chase>可以先给他做血透析
<11-4,Chase>We should start him on plasmaphoresis.

216
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:26,250
<11-5,House>清晰准确, 值得表扬
<11-5,House>Clear,concise,and completely plausible.

217
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,270
<11-5,House>上次我就是这么做的, 无效,还有别的吗?
<11-5,House>And exactly what I did last time.Didn't work.What else?

218
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:31,550
<11-5,House>肺出血肾炎综合症
<11-5,House>Good pasture's syndrome.

219
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:34,420
<11-6,Cameron>血液中的抗体导致肾功能失常并出血
<11-6,Cameron>Circulating antibodies cause kidney failure and bleeding.

220
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,090
<11-7,House>但不会造成紫色丘疹
<11-7,House>But not the purple papules.

221
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:40,070
<11-8,Foreman>考虑到esther接着出现脑症状,重金属中毒也有可能
<11-8,Foreman>if you throw in esther's next symptom--brain--makes me think heavy metal toxicity.

222
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:45,300
<11-9,Cameron>那他的血容应该很低, 他是44,Esther也未低于 -42
<11-9,Cameron>--His hematocrit would have to be low.It's at 44,and esther's never dropped below. --42.

223
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:46,410
<11-11,Foreman>你把病历都背下来了?
<11-11,Foreman>You have the file memorized?

224
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:48,000
<11-12,House>这是我的幸运数字
<11-12,House>It's my lucky number.

225
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:49,210
<11-13,Cameron>淋巴瘤?
<11-13,Cameron>What about lymphoma?

226
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:53,800
<11-13,Cameron>导致肾衰竭, 肠胃出血, 并能破坏大脑基底
<11-13,Cameron>Causes kidney failure,gi bleed,and can infiltrate the base of the brain.

227
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,530
<11-14,Foreman>Esther做过这些检查?
<11-14,Foreman>You check esther for that?

228
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:59,250
<11-15,House>她没表现出这些症状...
<11-15,House>She never showed any signs of...

229
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:04,140
<11-15,House>如果他的淋巴瘤发展到这个地步,从血液和大脑能得到判断
<11-15,House>if he has lymphoma this far advanced,we should be able to see it in his blood and brain.

<11-18,Cameron>她认为孩子是肚子疼
<11-18,Cameron>She thinks the kid has a stomach ache.

<11-19,House>She'll come right up here and do one of two things.

235
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:18,670
<11-19,House>她同意我的看法, 我用不着她,她不同意我的看法, 我不想见她
<11-19,House>If she agrees with me,I don't need her.If she disagrees,I don't want her.

236
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,410
<11-20,Foreman>容不得别人和你意见不同?
<11-20,Foreman>Can't handle people disagreeing with you?

237
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:22,130
<11-20,Foreman>她也许有不同的观点
<11-20,Foreman>She might have a different take on this.

238
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,250
<11-21,House>下属可以和我意见相左, 这很健康
<11-21,House>Subordinates can disagree with me all they want.It's healthy.

<11-21,House>能停我职的人, 就不能这样...
<11-21,House>People who can shut me down,on the other hand...

240
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:31,650
<11-21,House>不用管cuddy, 我会让wilson把她拖住
<11-21,House>forget cuddy.I'll have wilson keep her busy.

241
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:42,360
<12-1,House>回答要简短并且不着边际,cuddy还在玩牌么?
<12-1,House>Keep your answers short and discreet.Is cuddy still playing?

242
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:46,110
<12-2,Wilson>小妞...还在皮卡迪利广场
<12-2,Wilson>The chicken...is still in piccadilly square.

<12-3,House>太好了, 她不会料到我们要攻打诺曼底
<12-3,House>Brilliant.She'll never suspect that normandy is our target.

244
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:50,460
<12-4,Cuddy>是House吗?
<12-4,Cuddy>Is that house?

<12-4,Cuddy>告诉他最低下注已经升到20/40,他快没钱了
<12-4,Cuddy>Tell him that the blinds just went to 20/40,and he's running out of chips.

246

<12-5,House>她玩的怎么样?
<12-5,House>how's she doing?

247
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:56,560
<12-6,Wilson>出什么情况了?
<12-6,Wilson>Well,what's going on?

248
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,350
<12-6,Wilson>你走的时候, 很明显-
<12-6,Wilson>The way you took off,something's obviously--

249
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:01,280
<12-7,House>聊天很愉快, 但我们还有场牌要打,她玩的怎么样?
<12-7,House>love to chat.But got a game to play.How's she doing?

<12-8,Wilson>病人还在维生器上, 我们要拔掉管子
<12-8,Wilson>The patient is on life support.We're about to pull the plug.

251
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,620
<12-9,Cuddy>你是在说我?
<12-9,Cuddy>Are you talking about me?

252
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,430
<12-10,House>你拿的什么牌?
<12-10,House>What have you got?

253
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:10,010
<12-11,Wilson>高剂量心脏药物
<12-11,Wilson>those sound like high-dose cardio meds.

254
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,330
<12-12,House>两张红桃
<12-12,House>Two hearts.

255
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,030
<12-12,House>你有顺子?
<12-12,House>You got the flush?

00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,510
<12-13,Wilson>还在等化验结果
<12-13,Wilson>Still waiting on the final labs.

257
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,450
<12-14,House>她在喝seltzer矿泉水?
<12-14,House>She drinking her seltzer?

258
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:19,420
<12-15,Wilson>不, 水没有问题
<12-15,Wilson>No.Hydration is not a problem.

259
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:22,660
<12-16,House>她在唬你, 逼她全下了
<12-16,House>means she's bluffing.Push her all in.

<12-17,Cuddy>让我看看你的红心
<12-17,Cuddy>Show me your hearts.

262
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,580
<12-18,Wilson>梅花7
<12-18,Wilson>Seven of clubs.

263
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,070
<12-19,House>啊糟糕, 我搞错了
<12-19,House>Oh,dear.Sounds like I messed up.

264
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,480
<12-19,House>你得和她多纠缠一会儿了
<12-19,House>You're gonna be stuck with her for a while.

265
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:42,850
<12-19,House>再联系
<12-19,House>Talk to you soon.

266
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,520
<12-19,House>太好了
<12-19,House>Yes.

267
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,900
<13-1,Sarah>为什么要拍头部的片子?
<13-1,Sarah>Why are you taking a picture of his head?

268
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:04,230
<13-2,Cameron>我们在查淋巴瘤, 但是--
<13-2,Cameron>We're looking for lymphoma,but--

269
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:09,290
<13-3,Sarah>不是那个Erdheim什么的病,也不是肾病, 但他的肾就是不行了
<13-3,Sarah>so it's not erdheim something.And it's not his kidneys.But his kidneys are failing.

270
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:11,040
<13-3,Sarah>什么...哪里能找到Cuddy医生?
<13-3,Sarah>What--where's dr. Cuddy?

271
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,700
<13-4,Alan>House医生提到了另一个病例
<13-4,Alan>Dr. House mentioned another case.

272
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:15,120
<13-4,Alan>是不是曾经有个人,和ian的病一模一样?
<13-4,Alan>Is there another patient with the same--same thing that ian has?

273
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,660
<13-5,Cameron>不尽相同
<13-5,Cameron>Not...exactly.

274
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:17,580
<13-6,Alan>那是什么意思?
<13-6,Alan>What does that mean?

275
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:21,950
<13-7,Cameron>House医生以前有个病人,表现出的症状和你儿子一样
<13-7,Cameron>Dr. House had a patient a while back who exhibited the same symptoms as your son.

276
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:24,250
<13-8,Sarah>你知道是什么病?
<13-8,Sarah>Then you know what's wrong?

277
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,030
<13-9,Cameron>不
<13-9,Cameron>No.

278
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,010
<13-10,Sarah>那是什么意思?
<13-10,Sarah>So what do you know?

279
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,650
<13-11,Cameron>我们知道这个病大致的发展方向
<13-11,Cameron>We know the likely course the disease will take.

280
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,880
<13-12,Alan>是什么?
<13-12,Alan>which is?

281
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:34,760
<13-13,Cameron>- 她的多个器官衰竭,- 她最后怎么了?
<13-13,Cameron>She had multiple system failures-- --what happened to her?

282
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:42,370
<13-15,Cameron>入院24小时后死去
<13-15,Cameron>She died 24 hours after her admission.

283
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:51,850
<13-16,Foreman>Alston先生或者太太,能不能来帮个忙?
<13-16,Foreman>Mr. Or mrs. Alston,would you mind giving me a hand?

284
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:55,760
<13-16,Foreman>他总是乱动
<13-16,Foreman>he's having trouble sitting still.

285
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,040
<13-16,Foreman>这样不可能得到结果
<13-16,Foreman>It's impossible to get the detail we need.

286
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,690
<13-16,Foreman>我想你们的声音可以安慰他
<13-16,Foreman>So I figured he might feel more comfortable hearing your voices.

287
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,710
<13-17,Sarah>Ian, 亲爱的?
<13-17,Sarah>Ian,honey?

288
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:11,360
<13-17,Sarah>不要动
<13-17,Sarah>Just sit still.

289
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:14,170
<13-17,Sarah>很快就好了, 我们就在这里
<13-17,Sarah>You'll be done in a moment.We're here with you.

290
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:16,110
<13-18,Ian>我怕
<13-18,Ian>I'm scared.

291
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:18,640
<13-18,Ian>没事的, 宝贝, 那只是...
<13-18,Ian>It's okay,honey.It'S...

292
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:23,580
<13-19,Sarah>是一个大照相机,他们要给你的头拍照
<13-19,Sarah>it's only a big camera.It's going to take a picture of your head.

293
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:27,580
<13-19,Sarah>在家里, 你不是最喜欢我给你照相的吗?
<13-19,Sarah>You love it when I take your picture at home,don't you?

294
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:32,380
<13-21,Sarah>照那个相也要不动啊, 是不是?
<13-21,Sarah>And you have to hold still for that too,right?

295
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:35,550
<13-22,Ian>这和那个不一样
<13-22,Ian>But this isn't like that.

296
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,750
<13-23,Sarah>我知道听着吓人, Ian
<13-23,Sarah>I know it's scary,ian.

297
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:41,270
<13-23,Sarah>但你可以做到
<13-23,Sarah>But you can do it.

298
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:44,420
<13-23,Sarah>你已经是个小大人了
<13-23,Sarah>You're getting to be so grown up.

299
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:51,680
<13-23,Sarah>所以...只要坚持不动,一下子就好了
<13-23,Sarah>So just...hold perfectly still.Just for a little bit.

300
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:54,780
<13-24,Ian>妈妈, 你哭了?
<13-24,Ian>Mommy,are you crying?

301
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:59,580
<13-25,Sarah>不, 不是的宝贝,我只是累了
<13-25,Sarah>No.No,honey.I'm just tired.

302
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:03,510
<13-26,Ian>好吧, 我尽量
<13-26,Ian>Okay.I'll try.

303
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:36,050
<14-1,Cameron>- 他的大脑基底可见小块物质, 我们认为,- 垂体?
<14-1,Cameron>The base of his brain has been infiltrated by a small mass.We think--pituitary?

304
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:39,890
<14-4,Foreman>看起来像,这能解释低血压
<14-4,Foreman>Looks that way.Explains the low blood pressure.

305
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:44,660
<14-5,House>基本符合淋巴瘤
<14-5,House>Pretty much confirms the lymphoma.

306
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:50,730
<14-5,House>如果我们以强的松治疗esther...
<14-5,House>If we'd started esther on prednisone...

307
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,110
<14-6,Chase>看见淋巴瘤了么?
<14-6,Chase>did anyone see the lymphoma?

308
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:56,290
<14-7,Cameron>没有, 只看见一团,位置相当靠近--
<14-7,Cameron>no,we saw a mass. The location was consistent with--

309
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:57,980
<14-8,Chase>血液里也没见到
<14-8,Chase>didn't see any in the blood,either.

310
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:00,880
<14-8,Chase>白细胞未见细长, 也没有异常核型
<14-8,Chase>White blood cells show no spindling or abnormal nuclei.

311
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:05,110
<14-8,Chase>免疫化学反应没发现什么, 不是淋巴瘤
<14-8,Chase>Nothing on immunochemistries,either.It's not lymphoma.

313
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,600
<14-10,Foreman>那是一列火车
<14-10,Foreman>It's a train.

314
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:44,500
<14-11,House>我们不知道是什么火车
<14-11,House>We don't know what kind of train.

315
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:47,200
<14-13,House>- 我渴了,- 这里关门了
<14-13,House>- I'm thirsty,- It's closed.

316
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,970
<14-14,Foreman>没有
<14-14,Foreman>It's not now.

317
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,540
<14-15,House>我们还有一优势
<14-15,House>We got one advantage.

318
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,390
<14-15,House>我们知道病情的走向
<14-15,House>We know where the tracks are going.

319
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:05,040
<14-16,Chase>知道终点是死亡...
<14-16,Chase>The fact that the end of the line is death...

320
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,360
<14-16,Chase>这是个优势?
<14-16,Chase>is an advantage?

321
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:08,810
<14-16,Chase>只要我们知道, 就是优势
<14-16,Chase>The fact that we know is an advantage.

322
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:11,250
<14-17,House>也许我们可以抢先一步
<14-17,House>Means maybe we can get ahead of it.

323
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:15,690
<14-17,House>下一站是肝脏,在此之前我们还有...90分钟
<14-17,House>Next station is the liver.We've got...about 90 minutes before it gets there.

324
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:19,020
<14-17,House>也许我们可以砍倒一棵树挡住路
<14-17,House>Maybe we can cut down a tree across the line just outside of town.

325
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,220
<14-18,Chase>我去做超声波
<14-18,Chase>I'll do an ultrasound.

326
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:22,320
<14-19,House>不, 治疗措施告诉我们的更多, 更快
<14-19,House>No,treatment will tell us more,faster.

327
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,730
<14-20,Cameron>不知道治什么, 怎么出治疗措施?
<14-20,Cameron>How can we start treatment if we have no idea what we're treating for?

328
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:26,780
<14-21,House>所有的都治
<14-21,House>Treat him for everything.

329
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:30,250
<14-21,House>乙酰半胱氨酸, 干扰素, 水飞蓟素
<14-21,House>Give him acetylcysteine.And interferon.And silymarin.

330
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:33,780
<14-21,House>以及任何能想到的保肝药
<14-21,House>And whatever else you can think of to protect the liver.

331
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:48,370
<15-1,Wilson>发生什么事?
<15-1,Wilson>What's going on?

332
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,890
<15-2,House>随便看点电视,你怎么样?
<15-2,House>Oh,just catching up on some tv.How are you doing?

333
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:55,100
<15-3,Wilson>多谢你刚才的指点,病人的病情急剧好转
<15-3,Wilson>Well,thanks to your last consult,the patient has improved dramatically.

334
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:57,880
<15-4,Cuddy>告诉house, 病人要杀医生了
<15-4,Cuddy>Tell house the patient is about to kill the doctor.

335
00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:00,290
<15-5,Wilson>- 他说病人,- 听见了, 你拿什么牌?
<15-5,Wilson>- She says the pa-,-I heard.What do you got?

336
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:02,190
<15-7,Wilson>cuddy刚刚加注了, 而且
<15-7,Wilson>Well,cuddy just raised,and,

337
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,760
<15-8,House>你拿了对子?
<15-8,House>you're paired.What?

338
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,140
<15-10,House>对9?
<15-10,House>Nines?

339
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,230
<15-11,Wilson>你怎么知道?
<15-11,Wilson>How do you know?

340
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:11,050
<15-12,House>比这小的牌, 你不会这么兴奋
<15-12,House>Anything lower,you wouldn't sound so excited.

341
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,590
<15-12,House>如果比J大
<15-12,House>Jacks or higher,

342
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:16,160
<15-12,House>你的声音会变得好像,会计部的debbie坐在你腿上
<15-12,House>your voice sounds like debbie from accounting is sitting in your lap.

343
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,410
<15-15,Wilson>问问cuddy她能不能大过一对3
<15-15,Wilson>Ask cuddy if she can beat a pair of threes.

344
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,810
<15-13,Wilson>你想干什么? 如果你想害我
<15-13,Wilson>Wait,what's--what's going on?If you're going to mess with me,

345
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:22,070
<15-13,Wilson>当面做不是更好玩?
<15-13,Wilson>wouldn't it be more fun to do it in person?

346
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,930
<15-14,House>那倒是
<15-14,House>Yes,it would.

347
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:27,310
<15-15,Wilson>你能大过对3么?
<15-15,Wilson>can you beat a pair of threes?

348
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,710
<15-16,House>她怎么做?
<15-16,House>what did she do?

349
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:31,010
<15-17,Wilson>我让病人用口服液
<15-17,Wilson>I left orders for po fluids,doctor.

350
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,390
<15-18,House>不要用暗语了, 她知道是我
<15-18,House>Enough with the codes.She obviously knows it's me.

351
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,900
<15-19,Wilson>她在喝seltzer
<15-19,Wilson>She's drinking her seltzer.

352
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,900
<15-20,House>她停下了?
<15-20,House>Did she stop?

353
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,390
<15-21,Wilson>是的
<15-21,Wilson>Yes.

354
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:39,490
<15-22,House>全押
<15-22,House>Go all in.

355
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:40,850
<15-23,Wilson>可是...
<15-23,Wilson>.but...

356
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:42,190
<15-24,House>照做就是
<15-24,House>just do it.

357
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,390
<15-25,Wilson>你对这次筹款也太热心了吧
<15-25,Wilson>You couldn't care less about this charity event.

358
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,890
<15-25,Wilson>你说了不想害我
<15-25,Wilson>You claim not to be messing with me.

359
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:49,100
<15-25,Wilson>-  显然, 你要么是想让我-,- 闭嘴
<15-25,Wilson>- Obviously,you're either trying to keep me-,- shut up.

360
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:52,730
<15-26,House>上次, 我希望你继续玩下去,现在仍是
<15-26,House>Look,last time,I wanted the game to go on.I still do.

361
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:54,790
<15-26,House>也就是说, 这次必须让你赢
<15-26,House>That means that this time,you get to win.

362
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:56,350
<15-27,Wilson>稍等
<15-27,Wilson>Hold on.

363
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,710
<15-28,Cuddy>扣牌
<15-28,Cuddy>I fold.

364
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,510
<15-29,Wilson>house, 你没事吧?
<15-29,Wilson>house,are you sure you're okay?

365
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:50,220
<16-1,Chase>药物似乎有效, 肝脏还没有出问题
<16-1,Chase>Meds seem to be working.Liver's holding its own.

366
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:51,240
<16-2,House>很好
<16-2,House>Good.

367
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:53,200
<16-3,Chase>血小板在降低
<16-3,Chase>But the platelets are dropping.

368
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,480
<16-4,House>更好
<16-4,House>Even better.

369
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,690
<16-5,Chase>为什么? 这表示他的病加重了
<16-5,Chase>Why?It means he's getting sicker.

370
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,330
<16-6,House>这是新现象, 新的总是好的
<16-6,House>It's new.New is good.

371
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:02,100
<16-6,House>因为老现象必死无疑
<16-6,House>Because old ended in death.

372
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:06,750
<16-7,Ian>我喘不过气
<16-7,Ian>I can't breathe.

374
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:11,990
<16-7,Ian>怎么了?
<16-7,Ian>What's happening?

375
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:20,360
<17-1,Foreman>我们得给他上呼吸机了
<17-1,Foreman>we had to put him on a ventilator.

376
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,530
<17-2,House>他又回到esther的轨道了
<17-2,House>He's back on esther's path.

377
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:26,040
<17-2,House>我们让火车少停了几站
<17-2,House>And we managed to make the train skip a few stations.

378
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:30,040
<17-2,House>说明没有12小时了,他可能只有不到2小时
<17-2,House>Which means that instead of 12 hours,he's probably got less than two.

379
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:32,960
<17-2,House>引出了下面的问题,为什么? 我们做了什么?
<17-2,House>Which begs the question,why?What did we do?

380
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:34,890
<17-3,Chase>乙酰半胱氨酸会破坏肺功能
<17-3,Chase>Acetylcysteine could mess with the lungs.

381
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,570
<17-4,House>破坏, 不是在20分钟内彻底关闭
<17-4,House>Mess with them.Not shut them down in 20 minutes.

382
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:39,740
<17-5,Cameron>干扰素调节免疫系统
<17-5,Cameron>Interferon modulates the immune system.

383
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:42,830
<17-5,Cameron>它可以影响血液癌细胞,就像白血病一样
<17-5,Cameron>It could affect a cancer of the blood,like one of the leukemias.

384
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:44,820
<17-6,Foreman>它不是加速, 而是减速
<17-6,Foreman>It doesn't speed them up,it slows them down.

385
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:46,550
<17-7,Cameron>所有的都减速?
<17-7,Cameron>It slows down all 500 of them?

386
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:50,280
<17-8,House>谁知道这时候到哪里去找肿瘤科医生?
<17-8,House>Anybody know where we can find an oncologist at this hour?

387
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:58,030
<18-1,House>干扰素对白血病有哪些效果?
<18-1,House>What effects would interferon have on leukemia?

388
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:01,120
<18-2,Wilson>取决于什么类型的,可有好效果, 也可能是坏效果
<18-2,Wilson>Depends on what type.Could make it better,could make it worse.

389
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,990
<18-3,House>4年肿瘤科就学了这个
<18-3,House>Four-year fellowship to learn that.

390
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:07,360
<18-4,Cuddy>告诉house, 如果他想玩牌就下来
<18-4,Cuddy>tell house if he wants to play cards,he should get his ass back down here and play.

391
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,400
<18-5,House>听见了?
<18-5,House>You hear that?

392
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,600
<18-5,House>她想让我挂掉, 说明她心虚,全押上
<18-5,House>She wants me off the phone.Means she's vulnerable.Go all in.

393
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:15,530
<18-6,Wilson>可是这个聚会还有不到3小时结束
<18-6,Wilson>But,um,the party's over in less than three hours.

394
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,760
<18-6,Wilson>不到2小时就结束
<18-6,Wilson>it's over in less than two hours.

395
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:23,530
<18-7,Cuddy>说明你要么是有3张同花,或者有对3
<18-7,Cuddy>Which means you either have three of a kind,or just 3s.

396
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:29,790
<18-7,Cuddy>我猜是有对3, 我加500
<18-7,Cuddy>I'm guessing 3s.I bet 500.

397
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:31,660
<18-8,House>全押上
<18-8,House>Go all in.

398
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:34,260
<18-9,Wilson>你这明显是害我,你还不如--
<18-9,Wilson>You obviously want to bust me.Why would you--

399
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:38,960
<18-10,House>你要不押上, 我会告诉这栋楼里的人,你涂脚趾甲油
<18-10,House>either you go all in,or I tell everybody in the building that you wear toenail polish.

400
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:41,720
<18-11,Wilson>我全押上
<18-11,Wilson>I'm all in.

401
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:45,200
<18-12,Cuddy>我跟
<18-12,Cuddy>I'll call.

402
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:51,390
<18-12,Cuddy>我认准了你有对3, 不过,即使你有3个3...
<18-12,Cuddy>I'm betting you have a pair of threes,but even if you have three...

403
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:55,270
<18-12,Cuddy>也大不过3条9
<18-12,Cuddy>it's not going to beat trip nines.

404
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:03,120
<18-13,Wilson>哦不, 哦不 不不,这下可要肉痛了
<18-13,Wilson>Oh,oh no.Oh,no.That's gotta hurt.

405
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:03,670
<18-14,House>什么情况?
<18-14,House>What happened?

406
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:07,220
<18-15,Wilson>我的同花顺大过1对9
<18-15,Wilson>I just killed two birds with one straight.Good-bye.

407
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:09,190
<18-15,Wilson>行, 继续玩
<18-15,Wilson>Fine.Keep playing.

408
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:11,030
<18-16,House>但你要为我推荐一个肿瘤科医生
<18-16,House>But I need you to recommend a good oncologist.

409
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:14,870
<18-16,House>如果几分钟内还没人,这个6岁病人会死
<18-16,House>Because if I don't get one up here in the next few minutes,I got a dead six-year-old.

410
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:20,540
<18-17,Wilson>如果你需要帮助 , 开口即可,用不着玩这些
<18-17,Wilson>if you need help,ask.These games are insane.

411
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:23,270
<18-18,House>游戏的成功率高些
<18-18,House>Games have a higher success rate.

412
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:27,150
<18-19,Wilson>看不出来哪里像白血病,做过骨髓抽检么?
<18-19,Wilson>well,I don't see anything that looks like leukemia.You do a bone marrow biopsy?

413
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:28,510
<18-20,House>没时间
<18-20,House>No time.

414
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:30,320
<18-21,Wilson>如果是白血病
<18-21,Wilson>even if there is an occult blood cancer,

415
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:32,510
<18-21,Wilson>干扰素不会导致恶化
<18-21,Wilson>you wouldn't expect interferon to make it worse.

416
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:34,090
<18-21,Wilson>绝对没这么快
<18-21,Wilson>Certainly not this fast.

417
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,860
<18-22,House>什么这么快?
<18-22,House>What would move this fast?

418
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:38,970
<18-23,Cameron>自体免疫病,被自身的防御系统攻击
<18-23,Cameron>autoimmune diseases.If his body's own defenses are attacking him,

419
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,210
<18-23,Cameron>激活免疫系统就等于火上浇油
<18-23,Cameron>then beefing them up is just going to put fuel on the fire.

420
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,240
<18-24,Foreman>大脑和肺可能有结节病
<18-24,Foreman>Sarcoidosis could be in his brain and lungs.

421
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:45,960
<18-25,Cameron>胸透没发现肺门淋巴结增大
<18-25,Cameron>No,no enlarged hilar lymph nodes on his chest x-ray.

422
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:48,770
<18-26,Chase>全身性症状表明可能是,少儿类风湿性关节炎
<18-26,Chase>The systemic nature suggests juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.

423
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:50,530
<18-27,Wilson>或者"川崎病"
<18-27,Wilson>Or kawasaki's disease.

424
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,600
<18-28,Foreman>不是川崎病, 它不出现在老人身上
<18-28,Foreman>Can't be kawasaki'S.Doesn't affect the elderly.

425
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:56,540
<18-29,Wilson>这个...是小孩的X光
<18-29,Wilson>these...this is a kid's x-ray.

426
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:58,820
<18-30,Cameron>House以前的一个病人...
<18-30,Cameron>House had another patient...

427
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:03,850
<18-31,Wilson>她有没有川崎病难说,而这个孩子...
<18-31,Wilson>who may or may not have had kawasaki'S.This kid,on the other hand...

428
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:07,230
<18-31,Wilson>他制造出抗体, 侵蚀动脉壁
<18-31,Wilson>he makes antibodies that are eating the inside of his arteries.

429
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:10,580
<18-31,Wilson>逐一破坏重要器官的血液供应
<18-31,Wilson>Choking off blood to his major organs one by one.

430
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:14,600
<18-31,Wilson>首先是消化道, 然后肾脏,大脑, 现在是肺
<18-31,Wilson>First the gi tract,then the kidneys,then the brain,now the lungs.

431
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:19,910
<18-32,House>谁能想出来, 为什么老人不得川崎病?
<18-32,House>Can anyone think of a reason why kawasaki's can't affect the elderly?

432
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:22,540
<18-32,House>而不是这件事实?
<18-32,House>Other than that it doesn't?

433
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:26,350
<18-32,House>好
<18-32,House>Nice.

434
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:29,520
<18-33,Foreman>可以用血检确定, 自身抗体检测,沉降率--
<18-33,Foreman>we can confirm with blood work.We need an ana,sed rate--

435
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,250
<18-34,Cameron>化验至少要两小时
<18-34,Cameron>labs will take two hours.

436
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:33,130
<18-35,Chase>老妇人的沉降率多少?
<18-35,Chase>What was the old lady's sed rate?

437
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,820
<18-36,House>高达98
<18-36,House>elevated. 98.

438
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:38,700
<18-37,Wilson>不能用另一个病人的化验结果诊断这个
<18-37,Wilson>You can't use another patient's labs to diagnose kawasaki's disease.

439
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:40,210
<18-38,House>这是什么禁忌么?
<18-38,House>Is that like a dare or something?

440
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,870
<18-39,Wilson>没时间纠错
<18-39,Wilson>You don't have time to be wrong.

441
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:44,790
<18-40,House>那好, 我们到川崎病居住的地方找
<18-40,House>Fine.We'll look for kawasaki where he lives.

442
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:48,240
<18-40,House>Ian的冠状动脉
<18-40,House>Ian's coronary arteries.

443
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:55,420
<18-41,Wilson>这个病人
<18-41,Wilson>This other patient.

444
00:27:56,030 --> 00:28:00,480
<18-41,Wilson>老妇人, 叫Esther?
<18-41,Wilson>The old lady.Esther?

445
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,870
<18-42,Wilson>你有没有听说过白鲸记?
<18-42,Wilson>Have you read moby dick?

446
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,450
<18-43,House>是一本书?
<18-43,House>It was a book?

447
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:09,010
<18-44,Wilson>- 那是10年前,- 12年
<18-44,Wilson>- It was ten years ago.,- 12.

448
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:10,940
<18-46,Wilson>偏执是危险的
<18-46,Wilson>Obsession is dangerous.

449
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:13,930
<18-47,House>只有当你坐着一条木船,而你偏执的对象是条鲸鱼
<18-47,House>Only if you're on a wooden ship and your obsession is a whale.

450
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:15,110
<18-47,House>我觉得我很安全
<18-47,House>I think I'm in the clear.

451
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:16,830
<18-48,Wilson>你知道这是个比喻吧?
<18-48,Wilson>You do realize it's a metaphor?

452
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:19,930
<18-49,House>你知道比喻的作用,就是吓唬人们不做某事
<18-49,House>You do realize that the point of metaphors is to scare people from doing things

453
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,780
<18-49,House>通过告诉他们, 如果你做了
<18-49,House>by telling them that something much scarier

454
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:24,440
<18-49,House>将会有件更恐怖的事情发生
<18-49,House>is going to happen than what will really happen.

455
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:27,750
<18-49,House>我真希望能用个比喻更好地表达
<18-49,House>God,I wish I had a metaphor to explain that better.

456
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:32,660
<18-49,House>回去玩牌吧, 别担心,我不会被女巫吃了的
<18-49,House>Go back to the game.Don't worry.I'm not going to get eaten by witches.

457
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:39,850
<19-1,Chase>冠状动脉没事, 没有动脉瘤
<19-1,Chase>coronary arteries clear.No aneurysms.

458
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:42,350
<19-2,Cameron>改变模式, 看看血流
<19-2,Cameron>Flip the mode.Let's see the flow.

459
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:48,410
<20-1,Sarah>那个女人怎么死的?
<20-1,Sarah>how did that other woman die?

460
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:51,910
<20-2,Foreman>她呼吸衰竭
<20-2,Foreman>She went into respiratory distress.

461
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,880
<20-2,Foreman>心脏和肝脏已经-
<20-2,Foreman>Her heart and liver were already com--

462
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:58,400
<20-3,Sarah>不, 她疼吗?
<20-3,Sarah>no.Did she suffer?

463
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,750
<20-3,Sarah>痛苦吗?
<20-3,Sarah>Was she in pain?

464
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,340
<20-4,Foreman>我不知道
<20-4,Foreman>I don't know.

465
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:09,860
<20-5,Chase>血流稳定, 没有血块, 没有扰动
<20-5,Chase>Laminar flow.No blood clots,no ragged edges.

466
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:13,750
<20-6,Cameron>该死, 关掉吧,我们在浪费时间
<20-6,Cameron>damn.Shut it down.We're just wasting time.

467
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:20,590
<20-7,Chase>看右心室
<20-7,Chase>Look at the right atrium.

468
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,320
<20-8,Cameron>不是川崎病
<20-8,Cameron>That's not kawasaki'S.

469
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,720
<20-8,Cameron>不
<20-8,Cameron>No.

470
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:25,630
<21-1,Chase>很小,  但确实有
<21-1,Chase>it's small. But it's there.

471
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,850
<21-2,Foreman>Esther的心脏里没有肿块
<21-2,Foreman>Esther didn't have a mass in her heart.

472
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:29,360
<21-3,House>Ian还年轻
<21-3,House>Ian's younger.

473
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,670
<21-3,House>他不容易被打倒
<21-3,House>He can take more of a pounding.

474
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:34,870
<21-3,House>Esther在疾病到达心脏之前就死了,这病造成肿块并加速死亡
<21-3,House>Esther died before the disease reached her heart.The disease made a mass and made it fast.

475
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:37,960
<21-4,Cameron>- 可能是细菌感染,- 肌肉 - 结缔组织
<21-4,Cameron>Could be bacteria.Muscle.connective tissue.

476
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,560
<21-6,Chase>这孩子不能再接受猜测
<21-6,Chase>the kid can't take any more theories.

477
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:42,840
<21-7,House>我们只知道, 不论这肿块是什么,肯定和这病有关
<21-7,House>Only thing we know is that whatever that mass is,that's what he's got.

478
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:47,850
<21-7,House>需要切一片下来,做活组织检查
<21-7,House>We need a piece of it.I'm doing a biopsy.

479
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:02,590
<22-1,Chase>我关上百叶窗
<22-1,Chase>I'll shut the blinds.

480
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:04,230
<22-2,House>不, 让他们看
<22-2,House>No,let them watch.

481
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:07,210
<22-2,House>有观众我的表现才好
<22-2,House>I do my best work on the big stage.

482
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:10,860
<22-2,House>穿过上腔静脉
<22-2,House>Passing through the superior vena cava.

483
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:14,000
<22-3,Chase>进入心室
<22-3,Chase>You're in the atrium.Pull back.

484
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:17,450
<22-3,Chase>接触到心壁
<22-3,Chase>Hit the wall of the heart.

485
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:22,340
<22-4,House>在健康人身上做这个很简单
<22-4,House>These procedures would be so much simpler if we could do them on healthy people.

486
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:25,120
<22-4,House>又退出
<22-4,House>And out again.

487
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,190
<22-4,House>- 心室颤动,- 心脏停跳, 我叫人急救
<22-4,House>- V. Fib,- Cardiac arrest.Call it.

488
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:36,040
<22-6,House>快点, 电板, 快点
<22-6,House>Come on. Paddles.Come on.

489
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,780
<22-8,House>好了
<22-8,House>Clear.

490
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,670
<22-9,Over the announcement system>再来
<22-9,Over the announcement system>And again.

491
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,610
<22-11,Chase>- 没反应,- 再来
<22-11,Chase>- Nothing,- Again.

492
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,250
<22-13,House>你有表么?
<22-13,House>have you got a clock on this?

493
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:09,930
<22-14,Chase>你这样还要多久?
<22-14,Chase>How much longer you going to ep doing this?

494
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,080
<22-15,House>好了
<22-15,House>Clear.

495
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:18,090
<22-16,Chase>等下, 有反应了
<22-16,Chase>Wait.Got something.

496
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:22,290
<22-17,House>缓过来了
<22-17,House>He's back.

497
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:30,580
<22-18,Chase>你要干什么?
<22-18,Chase>what are you doing?

498
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:32,680
<22-19,House>继续刚才没做完的
<22-19,House>I'm doing what we came here to do.

499
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,790
<22-20,Chase>那差点要了他的命
<22-20,Chase>It almost killed him.

500
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:36,510
<22-21,House>我知道, 我就在这里,把真空管给我
<22-21,House>I know.I was right here.Give me a vacutainer.

501
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:39,390
<22-22,Chase>他的大脑缺氧超过8分钟
<22-22,Chase>His brain's been oxygen-deprived for over eight minutes.

502
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:41,400
<22-22,Chase>可能剩不下什么了, 你已经--
<22-22,Chase>There might be nothing left.You might be--

503
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:44,850
<22-23,House>通知他的父母,真空管在哪里?
<22-23,House>you should tell the parents.Where the hell is that vacutainer?

504
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:59,650
<23-1,House>他会怎么样?
<23-1,House>so.What's he got?

505
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:00,690
<23-2,Foreman>大脑损伤
<23-2,Foreman>Brain damage.

506
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:03,260
<23-3,House>极有可能, 我是问在这之前
<23-3,House>Good chance.I was talking about before that.

507
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:04,190
<23-4,Cameron>你难道不担心-
<23-4,Cameron>You're not worried about--

508
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:06,870
<23-5,House>无可挽回的事, 我尽量不去担心
<23-5,House>things I can't do anything about?I try not to.

509
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:09,860
<23-6,Foreman>说的好像你可以轻松忘记
<23-6,Foreman>Things just roll off you like water off a duck.

510
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:11,220
<23-7,Chase>组织细胞增生
<23-7,Chase>Histiocytosis.

511
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,240
<23-8,Foreman>不太可能在73岁病人身上
<23-8,Foreman>Very unlikely in a 73-year-old.

512
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,720
<23-9,House>不管是什么, 都很蹊跷
<23-9,House>Whatever this is,is very unlikely.

513
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:18,010
<23-9,House>快点, 再来点主意, 加油伙计们
<23-9,House>Come on,more ideas.Let's go,people.

514
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,700
<23-10,Cameron>遗传病可以形成肿块,结节性硬化症
<23-10,Cameron>Genetic disorders could cause masses everywhere.Tuberous sclerosis.

515
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,250
<23-11,Foreman>如果是遗传性的, 他一出生便有,为何现在发生?
<23-11,Foreman>If it's genetic,he's had it all his life.Why now?

516
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,450
<23-12,House>不知道, 不过有可能
<23-12,House>I don't know.It sure fits nice enough.

517
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:28,530
<23-13,Chase>我们并未排除白血病
<23-13,Chase>We haven't ruled out leukemia yet.

518
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,200
<23-14,Cameron>或者肉瘤, 可能是多发软组织肿瘤
<23-14,Cameron>Or sarcoma.He could have multiple soft tissue tumors.

519
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,410
<23-16,Cameron>或者结节病, 多发神经纤维瘤
<23-16,Cameron>or sarcoidosis.Multiple neurofibromatosis.

520
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:36,010
<23-17,Foreman>成软骨细胞瘤
<23-17,Foreman>chondrocytomas.

521
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:39,450
<23-18,House>玩的怎么样? 赢了?
<23-18,House>How's it going?Win?

522
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:42,580
<23-19,Cuddy>我被愤怒的家长叫来了
<23-19,Cuddy>I got called away by the angry parents of a patient.

523
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:45,930
<23-19,Cuddy>你们3个人在,没一个人想到要阻止他
<23-19,Cuddy>There are three of you here.None of you had the sense to stop him.

524
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:47,290
<23-19,Cuddy>没想到拿起电话找我
<23-19,Cuddy>To pick up a phone and call me.

525
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:48,330
<23-20,House>我告诉他们你会把病例转给我
<23-20,House>I told them you'd signed off.

526
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:52,100
<23-20,House>家长愤怒, 因为孩子要死了,这可以理解
<23-20,House>The parents are mad because their kid is dying.It's understandable.

527
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:54,510
<23-20,House>如果他不死, 家长就不会生气了
<23-20,House>But if he doesn't die,they won't be mad anymore.

528
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:56,880
<23-21,Cuddy>大脑损坏了, 他们照样生气
<23-21,Cuddy>If he's brain-damaged,they might still be a little ticked.

529
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:58,050
<23-22,House>我要救他就必须那样做
<23-22,House>I had to do it to save him.

530
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,200
<23-22,House>你那样做是为了诊断esther
<23-22,House>You had to do it to diagnose esther.

531
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:02,500
<23-23,Cuddy>你不惜杀死一个6岁小孩
<23-23,Cuddy>You may have killed a six-year-old

532
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:05,800
<23-23,Cuddy>因为你对12年前死去的一个女人不能释怀
<23-23,Cuddy>because you're obsessed with a woman who's been dead for 12 years.

533
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:08,510
<23-23,Cuddy>有时候你会失手, house,你不是上帝
<23-23,Cuddy>Sometimes you lose,house.You're not god.

534
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:09,410
<23-24,House>他还没死
<23-24,House>He's not dead yet.

535
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:12,110
<23-25,Cuddy>不, 这里没你事了,这是我的病人, 回你的家
<23-25,Cuddy>No,but you're done with him.It's my case now.Go home.

536
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:17,200
<23-25,Cuddy>去飙车, 躲在小黑屋里郁郁寡欢,就是别靠近Ian了
<23-25,Cuddy>Go ride your motorcycle.Go brood in a dark room.Just don't go near ian again.

537
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,810
<23-26,House>还有别的吗? 还是只有这7项
<23-26,House>So,anything else?Or is it just these seven?

538
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,710
<23-27,Foreman>放手吧, house 她是对的
<23-27,Foreman>Drop it,house.She's right.

539
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:32,210
<23-28,House>不对, 你知道她不对
<23-28,House>No,she's not.You know she's not.

540
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,250
<23-29,Chase>我们应该叫她
<23-29,Chase>We should have called her.

541
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,780
<23-30,House>我很惊讶你没有
<23-30,House>I'm surprised you didn'T.

542
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:38,290
<23-31,Cameron>无论如何你要放手了,我们不能再碰Ian
<23-31,Cameron>you're going to have to find a way to let this go--we can't go near ian.

543
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:39,980
<23-32,House>我们不用碰他
<23-32,House>We don't need to go near him.

544
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:42,240
<23-32,House>我们拿到了他的肿瘤
<23-32,House>We have his tumor.

545
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:45,120
<23-32,House>Cuddy也许说对了,我们没有按照指南
<23-32,House>Cuddy may be right that we screwed up the protocol.

546
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,290
<23-32,House>对于我的偏执, 她也许说对了
<23-32,House>She may be right about my screwed-up obsession.

547
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,760
<23-32,House>在医学上我是正确的
<23-32,House>But I am right about the medicine.

548
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,720
<23-32,House>这点样本能做几个检测?
<23-32,House>How many tests can we do with that?

549
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:57,670
<23-32,House>我们治好这孩子, 就不存在任何问题,几项?
<23-32,House>Look,we cure the kid,we solve everybody's problems.How many?

550
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:01,530
<23-33,Cameron>两项没问题
<23-33,Cameron>Maybe two good pieces.

551
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,300
<23-34,House>最多能做几项?
<23-34,House>How many okay pieces?

552
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:05,760
<23-35,Cameron>3项已经勉强
<23-35,Cameron>Three would be pushing it.

553
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:10,870
<23-36,House>3项测试, 7个选择
<23-36,House>Three tests,seven choices.

554
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:13,020
<23-36,House>好, 先做哪项?
<23-36,House>Okay,what's first?

555
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:15,850
<23-37,Chase>结节病似乎最有可能
<23-37,Chase>sarcoidosis seems most likely.

556
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:19,110
<23-38,House>太有可能了, cuddy绝对会想起来
<23-38,House>Yeah,so likely that cuddy's going to think of that all on her own.

557
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:22,820
<23-38,House>整个人都在她手上,让她去做这个
<23-38,House>She's got the kid's whole body to play with.Let her do that test.

558
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,140
<23-38,House>下一个?
<23-38,House>What's next?

559
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:26,370
<23-39,Foreman>这么快的速度不可能是扩散
<23-39,Foreman>It's moving too fast to be spreading.

560
00:34:26,410 --> 00:34:28,250
<23-39,Foreman>病灶肯定早就在了-
<23-39,Foreman>It has to be growing from something that's already--

561
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,430
<23-40,Cameron>遗传病——结节性硬化症
<23-40,Cameron>genetic disorder--tuberous sclerosis.

562
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:33,730
<23-41,Chase>或者是免疫系统, 组织细胞增生
<23-41,Chase>Or it's his immune system.Histiocytosis.

563
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:36,830
<23-42,House>组织细胞增生的报道多集中在老人身上-
<23-42,House>There are more documented cases of Histiocytosis.

564
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:40,170
<23-42,House>结节性硬化症则不然,从这个开始
<23-42,House>amongst older people than tuberous sclerosis.Let's start with that.

565
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:48,000
<24-1,Chase>要鸡翅还是鸡腿?
<24-1,Chase>Wing or drumstick?

566
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:51,550
<24-2,Foreman>需要再多点
<24-2,Foreman>Gonna need a little more than that.

567
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:53,160
<24-3,Cameron>再多就超过三分之一了
<24-3,Cameron>A little more is more than a third.

568
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:56,510
<24-4,Foreman>不给我们切够就要重复试验...
<24-4,Foreman>If we have to repeat this test because you didn't cut us enough...

569
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:05,390
<24-5,Chase>加入1微升免疫过氧化酶
<24-5,Chase>I'm adding one microliter of the immunoperoxidase.

570
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:07,900
<24-6,Foreman>两微升, 我不想被House找麻烦
<24-6,Foreman>Make it two. I don't want house biting off our heads

571
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,770
<24-6,Foreman>只因为我们不能确定显红色
<24-6,Foreman>because we weren't sure if it turned red or not.

572
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:18,790
<24-7,Cameron>没有显红色
<24-7,Cameron>that's definitely not red.

573
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:27,450
<24-8,Chase>可能还是的细胞异常增生,只不过在另一种组织
<24-8,Chase>your problem could still be an abnormal cell growth,but a different cell line.

574
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:31,410
<24-9,Foreman>肉瘤? 肌细胞遍布全身,这可以解释发病部位
<24-9,Foreman>sarcoma?Muscle cells are throughout his body.Would explain the geography.

575
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:34,740
<24-10,Cameron>6岁小孩更有可能是遗传病,结节性硬化症
<24-10,Cameron>genetic disorder is far more likely in a six-year-old.Tuberous sclerosis.

576
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:36,670
<24-11,Chase>这一般不造成消化道出血
<24-11,Chase>Pretty unlikely to cause a gi bleed.

577
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:37,850
<24-12,Foreman>时间序列符合
<24-12,Foreman>The time course fits.

578
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:40,700
<24-13,House>foreman, 你同意他们两个,你还真会玩
<24-13,House>So,foreman,you agree with both of them.Thanks for playing.

579
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:43,420
<24-14,Foreman>如果剩下的组织还能做两项,为什么不都做?
<24-14,Foreman>If we have enough tissue for two tests,why not do both?

580
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:44,640
<24-15,House>我们不必这么思考
<24-15,House>Then we don't have to think as hard.

581
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:48,110
<24-15,House>摆脱做选择的压力,可以让我们更好的思考
<24-15,House>Taking the pressure off the choice makes us less likely to think critically.

582
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:50,890
<24-16,Foreman>肉瘤在6岁和70岁人身上都是多发的
<24-16,Foreman>Sarcoma is more likely to hit a 6- and a 70-year-old.

583
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,490
<24-17,House>结节性硬化症
<24-17,House>Tuberous sclerosis it is.

584
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,340
<24-18,Foreman>你认为肉瘤的几率小?
<24-18,Foreman>You think sarcoma is less likely?

585
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:58,480
<24-19,House>几率大, 但是检测方法不甚可靠
<24-19,House>It's more likely.The test for it,on the other hand,is less reliable.

586
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:12,090
<25-1,Cameron>nestin阴性
<25-1,Cameron>nestin's negative.

587
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:13,190
<25-1,Cameron>这好解释
<25-1,Cameron>Well,that's okay.

588
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:18,370
<25-2,Foreman>如果肿瘤细胞未成熟,KI-67蛋白不会消失
<25-2,Foreman>If the tumor cells haven't matured,the ki-67 protein wouldn't have turned off.

589
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:21,020
<25-2,Foreman>如果我们不能解决这个,会发生什么事?
<25-2,Foreman>What happens if we don't solve this?

590
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:22,160
<25-3,Cameron>小孩会死
<25-3,Cameron>The kid dies.

591
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:24,550
<25-4,Foreman>我指将来的12年
<25-4,Foreman>I mean for the next 12 years.

592
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:28,180
<25-5,Chase>Ki-67蛋白阴性
<25-5,Chase>Ki-67's negative.

593
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:33,980
<25-5,Chase>PCH抗原阴性
<25-5,Chase>And pch antigen is negative.

594
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:47,570
<25-6,House>Mighty casey剩最后一期了
<25-6,House>Mighty casey's down to his last strike.

595
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:49,220
<25-7,Foreman>Mighty casey早就停了
<25-7,Foreman>Mighty casey struck out.

596
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:52,220
<25-8,House>多谢, 我本来计划这周末看的
<25-8,House>Thanks a lot. I was going to read that this weekend.

597
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:56,010
<25-9,Cameron>成软骨细胞瘤,结缔组织在所有地方都有
<25-9,Cameron>chondrocytoma.Connective tissue has been in all the places we've been looking.

598
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:58,560
<25-10,Foreman>孩子病的太厉害了,最好还是检测肉瘤
<25-10,Foreman>The kid is too sick for that.We're better off testing for sarcoma.

599
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,200
<25-11,Cameron>测结节性硬化症时,就应该看到一些指征
<25-11,Cameron>we would have seen signs of that when we tested for tuberous sclerosis.

600
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,700
<25-12,Foreman>在显微镜下肿瘤细胞和肌细胞差不多
<25-12,Foreman>Tumor cells look like muscle under the microscope.

601
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:06,550
<25-13,Cameron>不是的, 看上去像脂肪
<25-13,Cameron>No,they didn'T.They looked like fat.

602
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:10,270
<25-14,Chase>我赞成神经纤维瘤
<25-14,Chase>I vote for neurofibromatosis.

603
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:11,380
<25-15,House>为什么?
<25-15,House>Why?

604
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:14,690
<25-16,Chase>因为其它的选择更差
<25-16,Chase>Because the other choices suck worse.

605
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:23,650
<25-17,House>给我点时间
<25-17,House>Give me a minute.

606
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:55,970
<26-1,House>你要我出去?
<26-1,House>You want me out of here?

607
00:37:56,730 --> 00:38:00,070
<26-2,Cuddy>你查出新的东西?
<26-2,Cuddy>You come up with anything?

608
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:02,960
<26-2,Cuddy>没有
<26-2,Cuddy>No.

609
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:33,280
<27-1,Wilson>我们明天再说
<27-1,Wilson>We can talk about it tomorrow.

610
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:46,450
<27-2,House>我...我赢了扑克比赛
<27-2,House>I,um,I won the poker tournament.

611
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:50,560
<27-3,Wilson>我彻底打败了商务服务部的berman
<27-3,Wilson>I totally played this guy berman from business affairs.

612
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:54,650
<27-3,Wilson>我拿了好牌,  但我不声张,只跟不加
<27-3,Wilson>I got great cards.But I don't bet.Just call,no raises.

613
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:57,050
<27-3,Wilson>Berman牌面是一对K
<27-3,Wilson>Berman pairs his king on the flop.

614
00:38:57,090 --> 00:39:01,040
<27-3,Wilson>我一直跟他, 然后看自己的底牌
<27-3,Wilson>I keep calling,the river turns,I check.

615
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:05,970
<27-3,Wilson>他受不了了, 全部押上,他确信能赢
<27-3,Wilson>He can't stand it.He goes all in.He's sure he's won.

616
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:10,330
<27-3,Wilson>我跟了, 亮牌
<27-3,Wilson>I call,I flip 'em.

617
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,860
<27-4,House>一对A
<27-4,House>Pocket aces.

618
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:15,990
<27-5,Wilson>我把他放倒了
<27-5,Wilson>I nailed his ass.

619
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:26,920
<27-6,House>王牌总是隐藏着
<27-6,House>The aces were hiding all along.

620
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,870
<28-1,House>测erdheim-chester病
<28-1,House>Test him for erdheim chester disease.

621
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:39,290
<28-2,Foreman>erdheim-chester病?,它甚至不在名单上
<28-2,Foreman>Erdheim chester?That's not even on the list.

622
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:42,500
<28-3,Chase>因为我们已经做过,是阴性
<28-3,Chase>Because we already did it.He tested negative.

623
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:43,740
<28-4,Cameron>esther也是
<28-4,Cameron>So did esther.

624
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:44,480
<28-5,House>疾病会撒谎
<28-5,House>The disease lied.

625
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,770
<28-6,Cameron>是啊, 肿瘤骗到你了,疾病不撒谎
<28-6,Cameron>yeah,the tumor's got it in for you.Diseases don't lie.

626
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:49,930
<28-7,House>好吧, 疾病不撒谎,只是慢慢地玩弄我们
<28-7,House>Fine,it didn't lie.It slow played us.

627
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:53,550
<28-7,House>活检的是结肠,当时还没到达消化道
<28-7,House>We biopsied the colon,but it hadn't reached the gi tract yet.

628
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:56,990
<28-7,House>现在它到了, 还到了肝, 肺...
<28-7,House>It's there now. It's in his liver,his lungs...

629
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,240
<28-8,Chase>我们希望它在那里
<28-8,Chase>you want it to be there.

630
00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:00,960
<28-8,Chase>这样你12年前就不算失手了
<28-8,Chase>Because then you didn't screw up 12 years ago.

631
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:06,130
<28-9,Foreman>不能不能浪费样品,做一项已经排除的测试
<28-9,Foreman>We can't waste our one test on the one disease we know it's not.

632
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:10,120
<28-10,House>动手吧
<28-10,House>Run the test.

633
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,590
<29-1,Chase>你确定?
<29-1,Chase>You sure about this?

634
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:28,170
<29-2,House>等等, 我再考虑下, 别催我,赶紧开始测试
<29-2,House>Wait,let me think about that.Don't pressure me.Just run the damn test.

635
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:32,060
<29-3,Cameron>看上去像巨噬细胞
<29-3,Cameron>cells look like macrophages.

636
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:34,370
<29-4,House>不错的开始
<29-4,House>That's a good start.

637
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:43,080
<29-5,House>慢慢来, 大声地报出来
<29-5,House>Take your time and say it loud.

638
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:55,070
<29-6,Foreman>Cd 68阳性
<29-6,Foreman>Cd 68 positive.

639
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:08,490
<29-7,House>开始治疗
<29-7,House>Start the treatment.

640
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:10,570
<29-8,Wilson>esther现在可以安息了?
<29-8,Wilson>So esther can rest peaceful now?

642
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:26,550
<29-9,House>你走运了
<29-9,House>You got lucky.

643
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,070
<29-10,Wilson>跟不跟?
<29-10,Wilson>You gonna call?

644
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:31,150
<29-11,House>我的策略...
<29-11,House>What I do...

645
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:34,060
<29-11,House>不光是根据牌面
<29-11,House>is not just based on the flip of a card.

646
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:37,070
<29-12,Wilson>你猜的, 走运而已
<29-12,Wilson>You guessed.You got lucky.

647
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:38,490
<29-13,House>猜中了
<29-13,House>It fit.

648
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,770
<29-14,Wilson>有很大可能是肉瘤或结节性硬化症
<29-14,Wilson>It could just as easily have been sarcoma or tuberous sclerosis.

649
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:44,150
<29-15,House>不, 没那么大可能
<29-15,House>No,not just as easily.

650
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:45,360
<29-16,Wilson>也许吧
<29-16,Wilson>Maybe not.

651
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:47,720
<29-16,Wilson>但不是不可能
<29-16,Wilson>But it wasn't impossible.

652
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:51,400
<29-16,Wilson>你跟不跟?
<29-16,Wilson>Are you going to call?

653
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:56,340
<29-17,House>知道吗, 根据身体的比例
<29-17,House>You know,relative to its size,

654
00:42:56,450 --> 00:43:00,290
<29-17,House>所有动物中阴茎尺寸最大的是藤壶
<29-17,House>the barnacle has the largest penis of any animal.
