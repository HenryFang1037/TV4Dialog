115
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:56,420
<5-4,Chase>-你向他表白了吗  -当然没有
<5-4,Chase>- You told him you liked him? - No, of course not.

116
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:57,790
<5-6,Chase>那你们说了些什么
<5-6,Chase>Wh-What are you talking about then?

117
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,900
<5-7,Cameron>我问他是否喜欢我
<5-7,Cameron>I asked him if he liked me.

118
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:01,480
<5-8,Chase>为什么这么做
<5-8,Chase>Why would you do that?

119
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:06,970
<5-9,Cameron>因为...我喜欢他
<5-9,Cameron>Because- I like him.

120
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,240
<5-10,Chase>你说的喜欢是那种喜欢吗
<5-10,Chase>You like him like him?

121
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,770
<5-11,Cameron>无所谓了  反正他不喜欢我
<5-11,Cameron>Doesn't matter. He doesn't like me.

122
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:13,870
<5-12,Chase>他谁也不喜欢
<5-12,Chase>Hey, he doesn't like anybody.

123
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,900
<5-12,Chase>也没人喜欢他
<5-12,Chase>And nobody likes him.

124
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:23,040
<6-1,Chase>核磁共振结果表明他的硬膜下血肿
<6-1,Chase>M.R.I. Showed a subdural hematoma.

125
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,560
<6-2,Foreman>出血导致他的颅内压升高
<6-2,Foreman>Bleeding around his brain caused pressure inside his head,

126
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,460
<6-2,Foreman>从而引起昏迷
<6-2,Foreman>which caused the coma.

127
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,920
<6-3,House>看上去像伪膜
<6-3,House>These look like pseudo-membranes.

128
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,210
<6-3,House>短期内无法形成
<6-3,House>Those take time to form.

129
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,250
<6-3,House>如果是旧伤  不会引起昏迷
<6-3,House>If it's an old injury, it wouldn't cause the coma.

130
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,580
<6-4,Cameron>病历上记载他在1996年被轮胎撬棍打伤过
<6-4,Cameron>Patient history indicates he was hit with a tire iron in 1996.

131
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,960
<6-4,Cameron>他弟说他在换轮胎时  撬棍不慎弹到了头上
<6-4,Cameron>Brother says he was changing a tire and it slipped.

132
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:44,190
<6-5,Foreman>位于所见之处的旧血肿或许能导致他的昏迷
<6-5,Foreman>An old hematoma placed where this one is could have caused his coma.

133
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,780
<6-6,House>-肝情况怎么样  -肝功能检测结果略偏高
<6-6,House>- What about his liver? - L.F.T.'s are slightly elevated.

134
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:50,530
<6-7,Cameron>略微高而已  但不足以引发昏迷
<6-7,Cameron>Key word is "Slightly," As in not high enough to cause the coma.

135
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:51,350
<6-8,Chase>是硬膜下血肿的问题
<6-8,Chase>It's the subdural.

136
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,600
<6-9,Foreman>要我说就清除血肿  看他是否会醒
<6-9,Foreman>I say we evacuate the cavity, see if he wakes up.

137
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,750
<6-10,House>神经科医生认为病因在他的脑部
<6-10,House>The neurologist thinks it's his brain

138
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,930
<6-10,House>要对他施行开颅  我深感震惊
<6-10,House>and wants to open up his head? Frankly, I'm shocked.

139
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:01,890
<6-10,House>你得用老爸红色工具箱里"大块头"专用钻头
<6-10,House>And you get to use the "Big boy" Drill in Daddy's big red toolbox.

140
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:02,760
<6-11,Joey>不用钻头
<6-11,Joey>No drilling.

141
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:09,470
<6-12,Foreman>-大家好  -史密斯先生
<6-12,Foreman>- Hi. - Mr. Smith.

142
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:13,700
<6-13,Joey>叫我乔伊就行  能不能别那样啊
<6-13,Joey>Call me Joe. Can you not do that?

143
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:20,240
<6-13,Joey>都听清楚我说不要钻头了吧
<6-13,Joey>So, we're clear about the no drilling?

144
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,380
<7-1,Chase>他没事了  可以出院了
<7-1,Chase>He's okay now. He can leave.

145
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:25,900
<7-2,House>我不会放他出院的
<7-2,House>I'm not releasing him.

146
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,490
<7-3,Chase>就因为他弟弟不愿意吗
<7-3,Chase>'Cause the brother doesn't want you to?

147
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:31,060
<7-4,House>是因为他的昏迷病因不明  哪个理由顺耳些
<7-4,House>Or because he had an unexplained coma. Which sounds better?

148
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:32,990
<7-5,Chase>血肿引发了昏迷
<7-5,Chase>The hematoma caused the coma.

149
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:35,100
<7-6,House>这个诊断真是悦耳  你都可以随其起舞了
<7-6,House>That's a catchy diagnosis. You could dance to that.

150
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,500
<7-7,Foreman>我赞同奇斯的看法
<7-7,Foreman>I think Chase is right.

151
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:45,130
<7-7,Foreman>血肿仍需清除  但非当务之急
<7-7,Foreman>It still should be evacuated, but it's not an immediate threat.

152
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,690
<7-8,House>卡梅隆定合我心
<7-8,House>Cameron's my girl.

153
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:52,360
<7-9,Cameron>我会让他出院
<7-9,Cameron>I'd release him.

154
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,140
<7-10,House>你不赞同我是不是因为...
<7-10,House>Are you disagreeing with me because-

155
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:58,520
<7-11,Cameron>这是我的专业医疗意见
<7-11,Cameron>I'm disagreeing because that's my medical opinion.

156
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,110
<7-11,Cameron>当然是啊
<7-11,Cameron>Of course it is.

157
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,900
<7-12,House>除非我被提名为"邪恶轴心"的第四成员
<7-12,House>But unless I've been named as the fourth part of the "Axis of evil,"

158
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:07,600
<7-12,House>语出小布什著名演讲
<7-12,House>明确指示的国家有伊朗  伊拉克和朝鲜

159
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:07,510
<7-12,House>被入侵占领了  否则这里还是我说了算
<7-12,House>invaded and occupied, this is still not a democracy.

160
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:08,340
<7-12,House>他继续留院
<7-12,House>He's staying.

161
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:11,460
<7-12,House>去做一下肝炎血清学和自身免疫性疾病筛查
<7-12,House>Send for hepatitis serologies and an autoimmune panel.

162
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,630
<8-1,House>我和你一样
<8-1,House>Hey, I'm with you.

163
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,450
<8-1,House>到了可以喝酒做蠢事的年纪
<8-1,House>Old enough to drink, old enough to do something really stupid

164
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:29,470
<8-1,House>再生个孩子
<8-1,House>and make yourself a baby.

165
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:30,310
<8-1,House>他是我弟
<8-1,House>He's my brother.

166
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,450
<8-2,Henry>我父母去了巴巴多斯  我暂时照看他而已
<8-2,Henry>I'm watching him while our parents are in Barbados.

167
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,000
<8-2,Henry>他呼吸困难  到处都能听到干啰音
<8-2,Henry>He's having trouble breathing, and there's a lot of wheezing.

168
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:39,210
<8-3,House>确切的说是哮鸣音  上呼吸道和鼻部都能听到
<8-3,House>Whistling, technically. Upper airways. Nose.

169
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,170
<8-4,Henry>如果他得了哮吼
<8-4,Henry>If he's got the croup,

170
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:43,530
<8-4,Henry>-会演变成脑膜炎  是吗  -当然
<8-4,Henry>- that, that could become meningitis, right? - Absolutely.

171
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:44,700
<8-6,Henry>当时我在学习
<8-6,Henry>I- I was just studying,

172
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,560
<8-6,Henry>突然间他哭了  哭声很怪异
<8-6,Henry>and all of a sudden I hear him crying and sounding all weird.

173
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:50,150
<8-6,Henry>我父母会杀了我的
<8-6,Henry>Oh- M-My parents are gonna kill me.

174
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:52,890
<8-7,House>-我不相信  -你不了解他们
<8-7,House>- I doubt it. - You don't know them.

175
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:56,410
<8-8,Henry>我是说你爸妈不在的时候你会学习
<8-8,Henry>No, I doubt you were studying while your parents were away.

176
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:01,840
<8-9,House>长官  你好
<8-9,House>Hello, Officer.

177
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:07,200
<8-9,House>你会洗洗再让他玩的吧
<8-9,House>You might wanna rinse this off before you let him play with it again.

178
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,330
<9-1,House>怎么了  他在哪儿
<9-1,House>What happened? Where is he?

179
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:32,240
<9-2,Foreman>沃格勒找到了住院处  住院处叫了司法机构
<9-2,Foreman>Vogler called Admitting. Admitting called Justice.

180
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,320
<9-2,Foreman>司法机构来把他带走了
<9-2,Foreman>Justice came and took him away.

181
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:35,480
<9-3,House>那谁给沃格勒报信的
<9-3,House>And who called Vogler?

182
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:45,780
<9-3,House>他是个赔钱货
<9-3,House>He loses money.

183
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:49,430
<10-1,Vogler>眼科也在赔钱  管他呢  这是所医院
<10-1,Vogler>So does Ophthalmology. Who cares? This is a hospital.

184
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,700
<10-2,Cuddy>-你不能撤掉一个部门  -你无法驾驭他
<10-2,Cuddy>- You can't just cut a department. - You can't control him.

185
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,640
<10-4,Cuddy>只有我才"能"驾驭他
<10-4,Cuddy>I am the only one that can control him.

186
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:59,280
<10-5,Vogler>说说说说曹操  曹操就到
<10-5,Vogler>D-D-Dr. House in the house

187
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,890
<10-5,Vogler>你总是出现得很及时嘛
<10-5,Vogler>Impeccable timing as always.

188
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:03,210
<10-6,House>你无权放走我的病人
<10-6,House>You had no authority to release my patient.

189
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,690
<10-7,Vogler>我的同事刚跟我说她有项独一无二的才能
<10-7,Vogler>My colleague has just informed me she has a singular talent.

190
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:10,110
<10-7,Vogler>正好你来证明一下
<10-7,Vogler>You are just in time for a demonstration.

191
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:14,600
<10-8,Cuddy>豪斯医生  据我所知
<10-8,Cuddy>Dr. House, from what I understand,

192
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,450
<10-9,House>-你的病人...  -你从何得知
<10-9,House>- your patient - From what you understand,

193
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,490
<10-9,House>他又不是你的病人
<10-9,House>he's not your patient.

194
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:20,570
<10-9,House>-你能知道什么啊  -悲哀啊
<10-9,House>- How the hell do you understand anything? - It's sad.

195
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,800
<10-11,House>你连医生都算不上
<10-11,House>You're not even a doctor.

196
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:25,670
<10-12,Vogler>只因法院命令  他才得以在此治疗
<10-12,Vogler>John Smith is here only because of a court order.

197
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:29,050
<10-12,Vogler>我把病历传真给了法官  她撤销了法令
<10-12,Vogler>I had the records faxed to the judge. She rescinded the order.

198
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,950
<10-13,House>你大费周章  就是想惹恼我吗
<10-13,House>Why bother? Just to piss me off?

199
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,680
<10-14,Vogler>不想趟政府的浑水
<10-14,Vogler>Keeping the government off our ass.

200
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:39,510
<10-14,Vogler>-对公共机构没啥好处  -好吧
<10-14,Vogler>- That makes no sense for a public institution. - Okay.

201
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:42,990
<10-16,Cuddy>-什么好吧  -长官  好的
<10-16,Cuddy>- Okay, what? - Okay, sir.

202
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,660
<10-17,House>你们继续
<10-17,House>Carry on.

203
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,770
<10-18,Cuddy>他真的关心病人
<10-18,Cuddy>He really cares about his patients.

204
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,580
<10-19,Vogler>他一无所获就出去了  肯定有事发生
<10-19,Vogler>Yeah, and he just walked out of here with nothin'. Something's up.

205
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,570
<11-1,Everhardt>他开始呕吐  继而昏迷
<11-1,Everhardt>Just started vomiting and passed out.

206
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,450
<11-1,Everhardt>再上点利多卡因和肾上腺素
<11-1,Everhardt>More lidocaine. 590, with epi.

207
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,230
<11-2,Paramedic>35岁男性
<11-2,Paramedic>Thirty-five year old male

208
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:05,370
<11-2,Paramedic>生命体征稳定  在路上给他补充了两升生理盐水
<11-2,Paramedic>Vital signs are stable now. Gave him two liters en route.

209
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,130
<11-2,Paramedic>他两小时前刚出院
<11-2,Paramedic>He was just released from here two hours ago.

210
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:12,170
<11-2,Paramedic>你说他已恢复  可以走了
<11-2,Paramedic>You said he was good to go.

211
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:14,800
<11-3,House>-注意那条管子  -他还是没有反应
<11-3,House>- Watch that line. - He's still not responding.

212
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:21,900
<11-3,House>联邦调查局的新人奖章也不是那么好看的哦
<11-3,House>So, the junior G-man badge isn't looking so good.

213
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:35,740
<12-1,Chase>-他的肝脏恶化了  -昏迷吗
<12-1,Chase>- His liver's worse. - Comatose?

214
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,790
<12-3,Cameron>不  与先前一次症状完全不同
<12-3,Cameron>No. Completely different symptoms than the first time.

215
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:41,180
<12-4,Chase>血清学检验丙肝阳性
<12-4,Chase>His serology tests came back positive for hepatitis "C."

216
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,970
<12-5,House>丙肝是慢性病
<12-5,House>Hep "C" Is a chronic condition.

217
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,880
<12-5,House>你觉得这不是急性病吗
<12-5,House>You don't think this is an acute situation?

218
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:48,470
<12-6,Chase>昏迷  呕吐  腹痛  一切症状都指向丙肝
<12-6,Chase>Coma, vomiting, abdominal pain. Hep "C" Explains everything.

219
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:50,310
<12-7,House>那怎么解释突然发作
<12-7,House>Except for the suddenness of the onset.

220
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,680
<12-8,Foreman>时间怎么了
<12-8,Foreman>What's wrong with the timing?

221
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,080
<12-9,House>某天晚上回到家中
<12-9,House>You get home one night,

222
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,400
<12-9,House>你被你老婆用棒球棍打了一棒
<12-9,House>your wife hits you with a baseball bat.

223
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:56,910
<12-9,House>可能是因为
<12-9,House>Likely causes:

224
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:59,480
<12-9,House>8年来你不曾感谢过她为你煮晚饭
<12-9,House>The fact that you haven't thanked her for dinner in eight years...

225
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:02,470
<12-9,House>或者在你裤子找到了皮手铐的发票[SM工具]
<12-9,House>or the receipt for fur handcuffs that she found in your pants?

226
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,620
<12-9,House>突发和事先计划  其结果都是一样的
<12-9,House>Sudden onset equals approximate cause.

227
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,880
<12-10,Chase>他血液里的雌性激素也偏高
<12-10,Chase>He also has high estrogen levels in his blood.

228
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:10,400
<12-10,Chase>这也是支持慢性病的一项指标  而非急性病
<12-10,Chase>That's indicative of a chronic condition, not acute.

229
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:13,420
<12-11,House>仅一项指标  其它肝功指标怎样
<12-11,House>One test. What do his other liver tests tell us?

230
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,400
<12-12,Cameron>白蛋白水平正常  说明是急性发作
<12-12,Cameron>Normal albumen levels point toward acute.

231
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:20,140
<12-13,Chase>怎么?  她的检查结果就比我的可信吗
<12-13,Chase>Oh, okay, and, uh, why is her test better than mine?

232
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:24,480
<12-14,House>尽管你们的结果相差无几  但是她更可爱
<12-14,House>Because she's cuter, though it's close.

233
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:27,740
<12-14,House>做个肝脏活检  结果出来时
<12-14,House>Do a liver biopsy. When the results come back,

234
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:28,710
<12-14,House>我们就知道病因了
<12-14,House>we'll know what we're looking at.

235
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,190
<12-15,Chase>为什么不治疗丙肝
<12-15,Chase>Why wait to treat the hep "C"?

236
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:33,030
<12-15,Chase>如果我说对了  那么乔伊就能尽早恢复
<12-15,Chase>If I'm right, Joey gets better that much faster.

237
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,840
<12-16,House>对的  然后他去出庭作证
<12-16,House>Right. Then he gets to testify.

238
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,890
<12-16,House>你就能从卡迪那里得个大红花
<12-16,House>And you get a gold star from Cuddy.

239
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:40,080
<12-17,Chase>那有什么不好  或者说这就是不好
<12-17,Chase>And what's the downside? Or is that the downside?

240
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,560
<12-18,House>不想让你得红花  还需要理由吗
<12-18,House>Do I have a reason for not wanting you to get any stars?

241
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:48,140
<12-18,House>好吧  开始治疗
<12-18,House>Fine. Start the treatment.

242
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,600
<12-18,House>你全权负责  别提我的名字
<12-18,House>It's all your idea. Don't even mention my name.

243
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,550
<12-18,House>你的理论没漏洞  开工吧
<12-18,House>There's nothing wrong with your theory. Go.

244
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:58,960
<12-18,House>但是当你还在"供我取乐"部门时
<12-18,House>But in the "Humor me" Department,

245
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:00,660
<12-18,House>你就得听我的  顺便去做个活检
<12-18,House>get a biopsy while you're at it.

246
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,440
<12-18,House>福曼  我们要谈谈
<12-18,House>Foreman, we need to talk.

247
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,650
<12-19,Foreman>-这个病人你不用管了  -什么
<12-19,Foreman>- You're off the case. - What?

248
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:15,720
<12-19,Foreman>为什么
<12-19,Foreman>Why?

249
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,050
<12-20,House>有人向沃格勒告密
<12-20,House>Somebody told Vogler

250
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,900
<12-20,House>说我欺骗了肝脏移植协会
<12-20,House>that I lied to the transplant committee.

251
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:21,150
<12-21,Foreman>-你认为我是告密者吗  -你谨小慎微
<12-21,Foreman>- You think I did? - You're too careful.

252
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:24,030
<12-22,House>没有十足把握  是不会轻举妄动的
<12-22,House>You wouldn't jump ship unless you knew what was in the water.

253
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:25,430
<12-23,Foreman>别说了  你在羞辱我
<12-23,Foreman>Stop. You're embarrassing me.

254
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,340
<12-24,House>可我想沃格勒认为我把你当做告密者
<12-24,House>But I want Vogler to think I think it's you.

255
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:29,330
<12-24,House>而我要卡梅隆和奇斯
<12-24,House>And I want Cameron and Chase,

256
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:31,340
<12-24,House>卡迪和威尔森  护士们
<12-24,House>Cuddy and Wilson, the nursing staff...

257
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,560
<12-24,House>甚至停车场的收费员都这么认为
<12-24,House>and the cashier in the parking lot to think that too.

258
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:37,650
<12-25,Foreman>好吧
<12-25,Foreman>Right.

259
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:42,060
<13-1,Chase>血检表明你得了丙肝
<13-1,Chase>The blood tests show you have hepatitis "C."

260
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,290
<13-1,Chase>这种病毒会感染肝脏
<13-1,Chase>It's a virus that infects the liver.

261
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,000
<13-2,Bill>不可能
<13-2,Bill>No way.

262
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:47,870
<13-3,Chase>未必是个坏消息啊
<13-3,Chase>It's not all bad news.

263
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:48,860
<13-3,Chase>这种病通常是可医治的
<13-3,Chase>It can often be cured.

264
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:51,130
<13-3,Chase>即便无法治愈  也是药物可控制的
<13-3,Chase>And even if not, it's manageable.

265
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,670
<13-4,Bill>我哥怎么染上这病的
<13-4,Bill>How'd my brother get this?

266
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,320
<13-5,Chase>该病通常通过体液交换传染  要么...
<13-5,Chase>It usually involves the exchange of bodily fluids. Either-

267
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,110
<13-6,Bill>体液  你什么意思
<13-6,Bill>Bodily fluids? What are you talkin' about?

268
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,800
<13-7,Chase>病毒传染的途径很多
<13-7,Chase>There are many ways the virus can be transmitted-

269
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,370
<13-7,Chase>比如说共用注射针头  输血
<13-7,Chase>sharing needles, blood transfusions-

270
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:04,640
<13-8,Bill>注意点  没人敢这么跟我哥说话
<13-8,Bill>Hey! Nobody talks to my brother like this, okay?

271
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,400
<13-9,Chase>好  不知道他怎么染上这病的
<13-9,Chase>Fine. No idea how he got it.

272
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:09,880
<13-9,Chase>可他身上携带丙肝病毒  我们要给他用...
<13-9,Chase>But he has hepatitis "C." We're gonna start him on-

273
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,990
<13-10,Bill>他没有染上丙肝  以后把嘴给我闭紧了
<13-10,Bill>He doesn't have it. Don't mention it again.

274
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,450
<13-10,Bill>别以丙肝治疗
<13-10,Bill>Don't treat him for it.

275
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,740
<14-1,Cuddy>豪斯有一些直接捐赠人以及基金会的赞助
<14-1,Cuddy>House has some directed donations, foundation support-

276
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,240
<14-1,Cuddy>在这里
<14-1,Cuddy>It's around here.

277
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,330
<14-2,Vogler>他让你苦不堪言
<14-2,Vogler>He makes you miserable.

278
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:34,860
<14-2,Vogler>他在这里工作8年  一个子儿都没赚
<14-2,Vogler>Eight years he's worked here- never made a dime for you.

279
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:37,010
<14-3,Cuddy>-从不听命于你  -他会变的  他
<14-3,Cuddy>- Never listened to you. - He can change. He's-

280
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,890
<14-4,Vogler>8年了  他都没变
<14-4,Vogler>He hasn't changed in eight years.

281
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,780
<14-4,Vogler>要么是他不会改变  要么就是你无力改变他
<14-4,Vogler>Either he can't change, or you can't change him.

282
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,520
<14-4,Vogler>你自己都数不清他骗了你多少次
<14-4,Vogler>You have no idea how many times he's lied to you,

283
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,420
<14-4,Vogler>蔑视你的权威
<14-4,Vogler>undercut your authority,

284
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:50,790
<14-4,Vogler>让你在其它医生面前颜面尽失
<14-4,Vogler>made you look like crap to other doctors.

285
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,290
<14-5,Cuddy>是  我恨他
<14-5,Cuddy>Yes, I hate him,

286
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:55,270
<14-5,Cuddy>而我现在却拼命想保住他的饭碗
<14-5,Cuddy>and here I am desperately trying to protect his job.

287
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:58,070
<14-5,Cuddy>-你对此作何解释  -说明你不恨他
<14-5,Cuddy>- What does that tell you? - That you don't hate him.

288
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,560
<14-7,Cuddy>我不是在保护自己喜欢的人
<14-7,Cuddy>I do not protect people I like.

289
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:04,090
<14-7,Cuddy>我是保护医院的人才资源
<14-7,Cuddy>I protect people who are assets to this hospital.

290
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:06,330
<14-8,Vogler>不  那是我的行事风格
<14-8,Vogler>No. That's me.

291
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:08,830
<14-8,Vogler>而你
<14-8,Vogler>You-

292
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,460
<14-8,Vogler>-而你太软弱  -好吧
<14-8,Vogler>- You're softer. - Right.

293
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:16,140
<14-9,Cuddy>美国的主要医疗机构里
<14-9,Cuddy>There are three female chiefs of medicine...

294
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,730
<14-9,Cuddy>一共只有三名女性主管
<14-9,Cuddy>at major hospitals in this country,

295
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:20,220
<14-9,Cuddy>我们都是通过我们女性手腕坐到这个位子的
<14-9,Cuddy>and we all got there using our feminine wiles.

296
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,020
<14-10,Vogler>保护自己喜欢的人乃人之常情
<14-10,Vogler>It's human nature to want to protect people we like.

297
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,160
<14-11,Cuddy>我不喜欢他
<14-11,Cuddy>I don't like him.

298
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,480
<14-12,Vogler>你想如果我们能组成合适的团队
<14-12,Vogler>To think if we just form the right team,

299
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:27,070
<14-12,Vogler>我们就能融洽相处  同舟共济
<14-12,Vogler>we'll all get along and be able to pull the boat-

300
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,110
<14-13,Cuddy>-我跟他相处不融洽  -这不是一个团队
<14-13,Cuddy>- I don't get along with him! - This is not a team.

301
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:32,260
<14-14,Vogler>这不是一艘船  也不是一个机器
<14-14,Vogler>It's not a boat. It's not a machine

302
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:34,320
<14-14,Vogler>无需众多零件共同合作
<14-14,Vogler>that has a lot of parts that have to work together.

303
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,110
<14-14,Vogler>比喻都是废话
<14-14,Vogler>The metaphors are all crap.

304
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,990
<14-14,Vogler>说白了这就是生意  仅此而已
<14-14,Vogler>This is a business. That's all it is.

305
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:42,750
<14-14,Vogler>你喜欢他  有损商业利益
<14-14,Vogler>You like him. That's bad for business.

306
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:54,860
<15-1,Henry>都是我的错
<15-1,Henry>Oh, this is all my fault.

307
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:58,010
<15-2,House>又借着做作业休息的名义去偷玩了吗
<15-2,House>Took another homework break with Betty Lou?

308
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,900
<15-3,Henry>不是  上周我表演了一个魔术
<15-3,Henry>No, last week I showed him a magic trick.

309
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:04,010
<15-4,House>你从他鼻子里拿出了一枚25分硬币  经典啊
<15-4,House>You pulled a quarter out of his nose. It's a classic.

310
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,140
<15-5,Henry>是啊  可他现在不停的往那塞东西
<15-5,Henry>Yeah, and now he won't stop shovin' stuff up there.

311
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:09,890
<15-7,House>-豪斯医生  -这里有紧急事件
<15-7,House>- Dr. House. - Got a crisis here.

312
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,130
<15-8,Henry>没事的
<15-8,Henry>It's okay.

313
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,530
<15-9,Bill>别闹了
<15-9,Bill>Stop!

314
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,900
<15-10,House>你这招倒是简单利落
<15-10,House>That's a neat trick.

315
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,600
<15-11,Bill>你得让孩子们相信你真的会打他们
<15-11,Bill>They have to believe you'll actually hurt them.

316
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,580
<16-1,Bill>你的手下侮辱我哥
<16-1,Bill>Your people insulted my brother.

317
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:53,020
<16-2,House>把罗马诺干酪放进帕尔马干酪罐里去了吗
<16-2,House>What, they put Romano in the Parmesan cheese shaker again?

318
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,880
<16-3,Bill>说他是瘾君子  同性恋啊  诸如此类
<16-3,Bill>Said he was a crackhead or a homo or somethin'.

319
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,400
<16-4,House>那些傻瓜
<16-4,House>Those idiots.

320
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,570
<16-4,House>得送他们去培训多少次情商啊
<16-4,House>How many times am I gonna have to send them for sensitivity training?

321
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,350
<16-4,House>没人说他是同性恋  情节太恶劣了
<16-4,House>Nobody's saying he's a homo. That would be really, really bad.

322
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,650
<16-4,House>换个友好的说法
<16-4,House>So let's put a nice, friendly spin on it.

323
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,660
<16-4,House>譬如  "他在监狱里被强奸了"
<16-4,House>Let's go with, "He got raped in prison."

324
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:11,990
<16-4,House>我看到监狱纹身了
<16-4,House>I saw the jailhouse tats.

325
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,840
<16-4,House>将之与血检结果联想在一起
<16-4,House>Put it together with the blood tests.

326
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,780
<16-5,Bill>是有谣言  可乔伊一直避而不谈
<16-5,Bill>There were rumors, but Joey never said anything about it.

327
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:22,510
<16-5,Bill>如果被人发现他得了丙肝
<16-5,Bill>If people find out he's bein' treated for hep "C"-

328
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,890
<16-5,Bill>联邦调查局得到那个病历
<16-5,Bill>Feds get that chart,

329
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:28,290
<16-5,Bill>一传十  十传百
<16-5,Bill>someone says somethin' to somebody, word will get out.

330
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,280
<16-5,Bill>那么乔伊的地位名声将会毁于一旦
<16-5,Bill>And then Joey's manhood, his rep- he's destroyed.

331
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:36,410
<16-6,House>你是担心
<16-6,House>You're worried about

332
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:39,230
<16-6,House>他在得梅因市沃尔玛的同事的反应
<16-6,House>how his coworkers will react at the Wal-Mart in Des Moines.

333
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,910
<16-7,Bill>他不会加入证人保护计划的
<16-7,Bill>He's not going into Witness Protection.

334
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,150
<16-7,Bill>我不会让此发生的
<16-7,Bill>I'm not gonna let that happen.

335
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,660
<16-8,House>听着  我不知道你知不知道
<16-8,House>Listen, I don't know if you know about this,

336
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:50,770
<16-8,House>黑社会一般都有两本帐簿
<16-8,House>but mob businesses sometimes keep two sets of books.

337
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,960
<16-9,Bill>-一个合法  一个非法  -没错
<16-9,Bill>- One legit, one not. - Exactly.

338
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,180
<16-11,Bill>你逗我玩吗
<16-11,Bill>You jerkin' my chain?

339
00:18:59,060 --> 00:18:59,970
<16-12,House>医生们很忙的
<16-12,House>Doctors are busy.

340
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:02,610
<16-12,House>他们偶尔会忘了记下一些东西  这种事很常见的
<16-12,House>Sometimes they forget to write things down. Happens all the time.

341
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:05,400
<16-12,House>谢谢
<16-12,House>Thanks.

342
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:09,200
<16-13,Bill>还有
<16-13,Bill>Oh, and, uh,

343
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:14,680
<16-13,Bill>你给他的药
<16-13,Bill>whatever you're not giving him for whatever he doesn't have,

344
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:16,460
<16-13,Bill>会治好他吗
<16-13,Bill>is that gonna fix him?

345
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:19,350
<16-13,Bill>不一定
<16-13,Bill>I doubt it.

346
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,680
<17-1,House>打算给沃格勒的车抛光吗
<17-1,House>On your way to polish Vogler's car?

347
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,460
<17-2,Wilson>脾气暴躁的老医生在地下室替病人看病
<17-2,Wilson>Gone are the days of the grumpy old doc.seeing patients

348
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:37,920
<17-2,Wilson>拿几只鸡当医药费
<17-2,Wilson>in the basement of his house,

349
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:39,120
<17-2,Wilson>那种日子早已远去
<17-2,Wilson>getting paid a few chickens.

350
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:40,280
<17-3,House>怎么吃
<17-3,House>How will I eat?

351
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,760
<17-4,Wilson>你知道沃格勒整整两天都在卡迪的办公室
<17-4,Wilson>You know what Cuddy's been locked away with Vogler about...

352
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,710
<17-4,Wilson>大门不出  二门不迈吗
<17-4,Wilson>all day today and yesterday?

353
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,080
<17-5,House>地板蜡的价格飞涨吗
<17-5,House>Floor polish costs through the roof?

354
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:48,320
<17-5,House>因为你
<17-5,House>You.

355
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:51,240
<17-6,Wilson>昨天卡迪的秘书一整天都在复印你的资料
<17-6,Wilson>Her secretary's been at the photocopier all day with your records.

356
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:52,520
<17-6,Wilson>他们现在就在看里面看资料
<17-6,Wilson>That's all they're looking at in there.

357
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,420
<17-7,House>我的车被偷了
<17-7,House>My car's been stolen.

358
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:00,240
<17-8,Wilson>是转世了吧
<17-8,Wilson>Or rein-car-nated.

359
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:08,430
<17-8,Wilson>老破车光荣退休
<17-8,Wilson>Pink slip.

360
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:12,410
<17-8,Wilson>阿奈罗兄弟赠你的礼物
<17-8,Wilson>A gift from the Arnello brothers.

361
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,690
<17-9,House>他们是黑帮分子没错
<17-9,House>You know, they're gangsters, sure,

362
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,000
<17-9,House>但他们也很体贴人呐
<17-9,House>but they're thoughtful too.

363
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:27,250
<17-10,Wilson>你不能收下  这是贿赂
<17-10,Wilson>You can't keep it. It's... graft.

364
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:29,210
<17-11,House>不  不  才不是
<17-11,House>No, no, no, no. Uh-uh.

365
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:30,520
<17-11,House>贿赂应该是
<17-11,House>Graft is if I tell him

366
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,810
<17-11,House>我先威胁不给票子就不治好他
<17-11,House>I'll only make him better if he slips me a couple bucks.

367
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,690
<17-11,House>或者买通我做不该做的事
<17-11,House>Or a payoff for something I'm not supposed to do.

368
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,900
<17-11,House>前提是我伸手要好处  可我并没有
<17-11,House>If I'd asked for the payoff, which I didn't,

369
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,300
<17-11,House>给不给反正我都要干坏事的
<17-11,House>I would've done the bad thing anyway.

370
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,180
<17-11,House>所以这没有问题
<17-11,House>So there's nothing wrong with this.

371
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,790
<17-12,Wilson>-对噢  -帅啊
<17-12,Wilson>- Right. - Damn.

372
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,720
<17-12,Wilson>65款
<17-12,Wilson>Sixty-five.

373
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:49,370
<17-13,House>保存完美
<17-13,House>Perfectly restored.

374
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,330
<17-13,House>你说要是有人拒绝乔伊的礼物
<17-13,House>What do you think a guy like Joey would do

375
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,060
<17-13,House>他那种人会怎么做
<17-13,House>if someone turned down a gift?

376
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,790
<17-13,House>这算是侮辱他了  对吧
<17-13,House>That's kind of an insult, isn't it?

377
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:01,180
<17-14,Wilson>他可能会伤害你  绝对有可能
<17-14,Wilson>He might hurt you. It's definitely possible.

378
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:03,890
<17-15,House>我完了  没得选  必须收下这车
<17-15,House>I'm screwed. Gotta take the car.

379
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,430
<18-1,Cameron>看到豪斯的新车了没
<18-1,Cameron>Did you see House's new car?

380
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:15,710
<18-2,Chase>乔伊送的  显然他不能接受
<18-2,Chase>From Joey. He obviously can't keep it.

381
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,000
<18-3,Cameron>医院从沃格勒那儿拿钱你就不介意了
<18-3,Cameron>You don't mind the hospital taking money from Vogler?

382
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,890
<18-4,Chase>这不一样  沃格勒是合法投资
<18-4,Chase>That's different. Vogler's legit.

383
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:24,230
<18-5,Cameron>这更糟糕  沃格勒投钱是带着一堆条件的
<18-5,Cameron>That's worse. Vogler's money came with strings.

384
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:27,480
<18-6,Chase>沃格勒不会诓我  害我被黑道的人打
<18-6,Chase>Vogler doesn't set me up to have a mobster take a swing at me.

385
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:31,090
<18-7,Cameron>-我相信豪斯不知情  -乔伊血压下降了
<18-7,Cameron>- I'm sure House didn't know- - Joey's pressure dropped.

386
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,560
<18-8,Foreman>静脉输液之后  收缩压维持在100毫米汞柱
<18-8,Foreman>Pushed I.V. fluids, now he's holding a hundred systolic.

387
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,740
<18-10,Foreman>-败血症吗  -不  他好像肝脏内出血
<18-10,Foreman>- Septic? - No, it looks like he's bleeding into his liver.

388
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,610
<18-11,Chase>是静脉曲张  慢性丙肝通常会这样
<18-11,Chase>Varices. See it with chronic hep "C" all the time.

389
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:42,600
<18-11,Chase>活检报告来了
<18-11,Chase>Biopsy's back.

390
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,130
<18-12,House>两大发现  第一
<18-12,House>Two findings. Number one,

391
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:48,720
<18-12,House>淋巴细胞性浸润  而桥接纤维化
<18-12,House>lymphocytic infiltrate and no bridging fibrosis.

392
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:51,310
<18-13,Foreman>看来要他命的病不是丙肝  是急性的
<18-13,Foreman>Whatever's killing him's not hep "C." It's acute.

393
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,610
<18-14,House>这话谁说过来着  我忘了
<18-14,House>Who said that? I forget.

394
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,680
<18-14,House>你在这儿干嘛  我告诉过你退出这个病例
<18-14,House>What are you doing here? I told you you were off the case.

395
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,320
<18-15,Foreman>对  你用魔鬼计谋
<18-15,Foreman>Right. Your diabolic plan

396
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:04,170
<18-15,Foreman>去让邪恶告密者相信他已经安全了
<18-15,Foreman>to convince the evil genius he's in the clear,

397
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:06,680
<18-15,Foreman>于是他就会放松警惕露出马脚  你聪明
<18-15,Foreman>so he'll let his guard down and make a fatal mistake. Sure.

398
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,930
<18-16,House>哎呀  你一说明显没用了嘛现在
<18-16,House>Well, it's clearly not gonna work now.

399
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:11,150
<18-17,Chase>什么邪恶告密者
<18-17,Chase>What evil genius?

400
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:14,830
<18-18,House>我们知道的话  就用不着魔鬼计谋了  是吧
<18-18,House>If we knew that, we wouldn't need a diabolic plan, would we?

401
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:17,600
<18-19,Foreman>豪斯认为有人向沃格勒告密出卖他
<18-19,Foreman>House thinks someone ratted him out to Vogler.

402
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,910
<18-20,Chase>什么  我们吗
<18-20,Chase>What, one of us?

403
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,620
<18-21,House>不  你们太爱我了
<18-21,House>No, you guys love me too much.

404
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,430
<18-22,Chase>行了  如果不是丙肝
<18-22,Chase>Look, if it's not the hep "C,"

405
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:27,040
<18-22,Chase>那是什么问题  引起肝衰竭
<18-22,Chase>Then what's the problem? What's causing the liver failure?

406
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,480
<18-23,House>第二大发现  毒素
<18-23,House>Finding number two, toxins.

407
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:32,530
<18-24,Cameron>不会  他才30岁
<18-24,Cameron>No. He's only 30 years old,

408
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:34,720
<18-24,Cameron>他的职业也没有接触重金属  或是环境中...
<18-24,Cameron>and his job doesn't expose him to heavy metals or environmental-

409
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,640
<18-25,House>他是30岁的黑帮分子
<18-25,House>He's a 30-year-old mobster.

410
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:40,030
<18-25,House>他的职业不会让他意外暴露在毒素中
<18-25,House>He doesn't have a job that results in accidental exposure to toxins.

411
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:43,700
<18-25,House>但会使他被人故意暴露在毒素里
<18-25,House>He has a job that results in intentional exposure to toxins.

412
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:48,590
<18-25,House>有人给他下了毒
<18-25,House>Someone's poisoned him.

413
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,810
<19-1,House>不管是什么毒  毒性发挥很快
<19-1,House>Whatever this toxin is, it's doing the job and fast.

414
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:12,130
<19-1,House>还有多久才能拿到下一轮检查结果
<19-1,House>How long till we have the next round of test results?

415
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,120
<19-2,Chase>四个钟头左右吧
<19-2,Chase>About four hours.

416
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:15,330
<19-3,Foreman>可惜他的肝脏只能再坚持两个小时
<19-3,Foreman>Too bad his liver's only gonna last another two.

417
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:16,620
<19-4,Cameron>我们必须给他换肝
<19-4,Cameron>We're gonna have to get him a new one.

418
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:18,110
<19-5,Chase>你说笑  两小时内
<19-5,Chase>What, in two hours?

419
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:24,730
<19-6,House>还有个办法
<19-6,House>There is another way.

420
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,780
<19-6,House>放心  符合犹太教规矩
<19-6,House>Relax. It's kosher.

421
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:42,760
<20-1,Bill>这太诡异了
<20-1,Bill>This is so bizarre.

422
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:46,400
<20-2,Chase>也不是  我们只不过把乔伊的血从他体内抽出来
<20-2,Chase>Not really. We just take Joey's blood out of his body...

423
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:47,770
<20-2,Chase>打进猪身体里过一遍
<20-2,Chase>and run it through a pig.

424
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:52,700
<20-2,Chase>猪的肝脏可以代替乔伊衰竭的肝  清洗血液
<20-2,Chase>The pig's liver does what Joey's can't. It cleans the blood.

425
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:54,780
<20-2,Chase>然后再把血送回乔伊体内
<20-2,Chase>Which we send right back to him.

426
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:58,270
<20-3,Bill>猪能帮他治病?
<20-3,Bill>And the pig makes him better?

427
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,130
<20-4,Chase>不  只能帮我们争取时间
<20-4,Chase>Nope. Just buys us some time

428
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:02,740
<20-4,Chase>来查明你弟弟中的什么毒
<20-4,Chase>to figure out what's poisoning your brother.

429
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:06,780
<20-5,Bill>说的轻松  好像你们天天都这么给人看病
<20-5,Bill>Like nothin'. Like you do this all the time.

430
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,440
<20-6,Chase>噢  其实我们地下室有个牲畜棚
<20-6,Chase>Oh, we've basically got a barn in the basement.

431
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:18,870
<21-1,Cameron>排除毒芹
<21-1,Cameron>Cross off hemlock.

432
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:22,020
<21-2,Foreman>你以为是毒芹
<21-2,Foreman>You thought he was being poisoned by hemlock?

433
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,500
<21-2,Foreman>欧里庇得斯[希腊悲剧大师]叫你查的
<21-2,Foreman>Dr. Euripides tell you to check for that?

434
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:26,000
<21-3,Cameron>这儿的高速公路旁边长了很多
<21-3,Cameron>It grows wild by the highways out here.

435
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:31,120
<21-4,Foreman>说说  你有多喜欢豪斯
<21-4,Foreman>So, how much do you like House?

436
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:34,540
<21-5,Cameron>-奇斯真是大嘴巴  -是啊
<21-5,Cameron>- Chase has a big mouth. - Yeah.

437
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:36,330
<21-6,Foreman>说不定就是他向沃格勒告密
<21-6,Foreman>He's probably the one who ratted to Vogler.

438
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:37,500
<21-7,Cameron>我觉得他不会...
<21-7,Cameron>I don't think that he would--

439
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:39,340
<21-8,Foreman>和豪斯在一起时痛苦吗
<21-8,Foreman>Does it hurt when you're with House?

440
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:42,020
<21-8,Foreman>好像肚子隐隐作痛  但又感觉很好
<21-8,Foreman>Little pain in the tummy, but it sort of feels good too?

441
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:44,110
<21-9,Cameron>我没权力喜欢上别人吗
<21-9,Cameron>I don't have the right to show interest in someone?

442
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:45,140
<21-10,Foreman>你当然有
<21-10,Foreman>You absolutely do.

443
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,360
<21-10,Foreman>而我也有绝对的权利拿这个来嘲笑你
<21-10,Foreman>And I absolutely have the right to humiliate you for it.

444
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:49,660
<21-11,House>有发现吗
<21-11,House>Anything?

445
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:54,100
<21-12,Foreman>白血球计数低  应该是因为生病
<21-12,Foreman>White blood count's low, probably a result of the illness.

446
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:55,330
<21-12,Foreman>和肝脏无关
<21-12,Foreman>Nothing to connect to the liver.

447
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:57,780
<21-13,House>-他吸烟吗  -我查查看
<21-13,House>- Is he a smoker? - Let me check.

<21-15,House>He's been smoking at least a dozen years.

450
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:08,900
<21-16,Cameron>十八年  你从白血球计数看出来的
<21-16,Cameron>Eighteen. You got that from the white count?

451
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,040
<21-17,House>不是  从胸部X光片看出来的
<21-17,House>Nope. Got that from the chest X-ray.

452
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,810
<21-17,House>白血球计数只告诉我他在戒烟
<21-17,House>White count just tells me he's quitting.

453
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:15,990
<21-18,Cameron>两周前开始的
<21-18,Cameron>Two weeks ago.

454
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:28,210
<21-19,Foreman>你的肚子还好吗
<21-19,Foreman>How's your tummy?

455
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,360
<21-20,Cameron>平坦紧密
<21-20,Cameron>Flat and taut.

456
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:35,110
<22-1,Brady>我做这行12年了
<22-1,Brady>I've been on the job for 12 years.

457
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:38,380
<22-2,Everhardt>你今天早上往你妻子的户头里存了三千美金
<22-2,Everhardt>You put $3,000 in your wife's checking account this morning.

458
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:39,950
<22-2,Everhardt>我要知道这笔钱哪里来的
<22-2,Everhardt>I wanna know where it came from.

459
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:44,030
<22-4,Everhardt>-我的记录向来良好  -钱从哪里来的
<22-4,Everhardt>- I got a perfect record. - Where did you get the money?

460
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:46,950
<22-5,House>撤下刑具  我找到元凶了
<22-5,House>Cancel the thumbscrews. I've got our culprit.

461
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,460
<22-7,House>-谁  -不是"谁"  是"胡"
<22-7,House>- Who? - Not who, "Hu."

00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,100
<22-8,Everhardt>-啊  - 感谢合作
<22-8,Everhardt>- Huh? - Thanks for playing along.

463
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:56,010
<22-9,House>柴胡  他戒烟糖里有中草药
<22-9,House>Chai Hu. Chinese herb in his "Quit smoking" Candy.

464
00:25:56,610 --> 00:25:59,820
<22-9,House>减轻烟瘾  同时也减少白血球计数
<22-9,House>Reduces cravings. Also reduces his white blood count.

465
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:02,500
<22-9,House>噢对  也是他吃太多  把自己给毒了
<22-9,House>Oh, yeah, he also took enough of them to poison himself.

466
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:04,740
<22-9,House>我们会让他在猪身上再多待几小时
<22-9,House>We'll keep him on the pig for a few more hours,

467
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:05,910
<22-9,House>然后给他戒了戒烟糖
<22-9,House>and then take him off the candy.

468
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:06,770
<22-9,House>他就会好的
<22-9,House>He'll be fine.

469
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:10,420
<22-9,House>猪就不好了  真惨
<22-9,House>Pig won't be. Oh, no.

470
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:24,080
<23-1,Joey>嘿
<23-1,Joey>Hey.

471
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:28,670
<23-1,Joey>感觉好点没
<23-1,Joey>Hey, feelin'better?

472
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,590
<23-3,Joey>饿死我了
<23-3,Joey>I'm famished.

473
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,730
<23-4,Bill>医院菜单上应该有鱼条
<23-4,Bill>I think they got fish sticks on the menu.

474
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:36,300
<23-5,Joey>是啊  让我怀念起监狱
<23-5,Joey>Ah, yeah. Makes me miss prison.

475
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:43,440
<23-5,Joey>那么古惑仔可以出院了
<23-5,Joey>So, the mobster's good to go?

476
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,400
<24-1,Wilson>我先留他一晚上  然后通知联调局
<24-1,Wilson>I'll keep him overnight, then let the feds know...

477
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:48,060
<24-2,House>他可以出去继续作供了
<24-2,House>he's good to rat out whoever he wants.

478
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:51,660
<24-4,House>-他弟弟会不高兴  -可能我得把车还回去了
<24-4,House>- Brother won't be happy. - Maybe I have to give back the car.

479
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,180
<24-5,Wilson>-你应该让沃格勒去和联调局说  -为什么
<24-5,Wilson>- You should let Vogler tell the feds. - Why?

480
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,060
<24-7,Wilson>因为他在意这件事
<24-7,Wilson>Because it matters to him.

481
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:00,940
<24-7,Wilson>因为乔伊第一次出院时  你出了他的丑
<24-7,Wilson>Because you humiliated him the first time Joey was released.

482
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,770
<24-7,Wilson>我说朋友  你觉得你还应该蹲守三垒吗
<24-7,Wilson>You think you should still be in third there, ace?

483
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:03,990
<24-8,House>他是自取其辱
<24-8,House>He humiliated himself.

484
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:06,260
<24-9,Wilson>还因为你的工作保不保得住
<24-9,Wilson>And because your job depends on the kind of mood

485
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:08,900
<24-9,Wilson>要看沃格勒和卡迪促膝长谈之后的心情
<24-9,Wilson>Vogler's in at the end of his marathon with Cuddy.

486
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:10,500
<24-9,Wilson>说真的  大哥
<24-9,Wilson>Seriously, man,

487
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:12,550
<24-9,Wilson>你以前有没有开过汽车啊
<24-9,Wilson>have you ever actually driven an automobile before?

488
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:13,710
<24-9,Wilson>一共有四档  知不知道
<24-9,Wilson>There are four gears, you know?

489
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:16,330
<24-10,House>66款配有一键"闭嘴"按钮
<24-10,House>The '66 came with a "Shut up" Button.

490
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:39,710
<24-10,House>我对这些检查有疑问
<24-10,House>I have a problem with the tests.

491
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,050
<24-10,House>我要知道...
<24-10,House>I need to know-

492
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,400
<25-1,House>从医学角度出发
<25-1,House>It is my medical opinion

493
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:48,190
<25-1,House>我判断病人已经康复  可以出院了
<25-1,House>that the patient is healthy and can be released.

494
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,290
<25-2,Vogler>谢谢你来告诉我们
<25-2,Vogler>Thanks for letting us know.

495
00:27:58,170 --> 00:27:59,480
<25-2,Vogler>给我接联邦检察官办公室
<25-2,Vogler>Get me the U.S. Attorney's office.

496
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:02,120
<25-3,Cuddy>看来你认识到我们开会谈什么了
<25-3,Cuddy>I see you found out what we're meeting about.

497
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,130
<25-4,House>你们在开会呀
<25-4,House>You're having a meeting?

498
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:06,830
<25-5,Cuddy>随你怎么说  你穿白大褂挺好看
<25-5,Cuddy>Well, whatever the reason, the coat looks good on you.

499
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:11,610
<25-5,Cuddy>柴胡糖造成这么严重的肝衰竭  怎么可能
<25-5,Cuddy>Chai Hu lozenges cause this kind of liver failure? No way.

500
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:12,620
<25-6,House>柴胡糖本身不会
<25-6,House>Not by themselves.

501
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:15,590
<25-6,House>但是结合干扰素  就像是火上浇油
<25-6,House>But in combination with the interferon it's like gas to a flame.

502
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,960
<25-8,House>-什么干扰素  -治丙肝的
<25-8,House>- What interferon? - For the hep "C."

503
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,410
<25-9,Cuddy>什么丙肝
<25-9,Cuddy>What hep "C"?

504
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:24,760
<25-11,Cuddy>隐瞒黑帮分子的丙肝  很重要吗
<25-11,Cuddy>Is hiding a mobster's hep "C" that important?

505
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,420
<25-12,House>让联调局知道一切实情  就重要吗
<25-12,House>Is letting the feds know everything that important?

506
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:29,650
<25-13,Cuddy>-你无敌了  就算现在...  -爱德
<25-13,Cuddy>- You are a piece of work. Even now, knowing- - Ed-

507
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:30,930
<25-15,Vogler>爱德华
<25-15,Vogler>Edward.

508
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,130
<25-16,House>乔伊又昏迷了
<25-16,House>Joey's back in a coma.

509
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,570
<26-1,Chase>情况稳定  但却昏迷
<26-1,Chase>He's stable, but comatose.

510
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,610
<26-2,Foreman>比之前更糟  他现在要靠呼吸机
<26-2,Foreman>Worse than before. He's on a ventilator.

511
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,770
<26-3,House>问题是为什么
<26-3,House>Question is, why?

512
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,750
<26-3,House>不是大脑  不是中毒
<26-3,House>It's not his brain. It's not a toxin.

513
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:54,350
<26-3,House>我们的朋友猪猪帮他清了毒
<26-3,House>Our friend Babe helped with that one.

514
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:56,520
<26-3,House>-那么还有什么  -丙肝
<26-3,House>- So, what else? - Hep "C."

515
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:59,050
<26-4,Chase>我们没有真正治疗过这个
<26-4,Chase>We never really treated it.

516
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,560
<26-4,Chase>一出现肝中毒我们就停用干扰素了
<26-4,Chase>We stopped the interferon when it started poisoning his liver.

517
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:05,300
<26-5,House>是不是要我写首歌你才满意  他的慢性丙肝
<26-5,House>Am I gonna have to write a song about it? His chronic hep "C'"...

518
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,350
<26-5,House>没那么重  不至于产生这些症状
<26-5,House>was not bad enough to produce these symptoms.

519
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,290
<26-6,Foreman>可雌激素水平表明是这问题
<26-6,Foreman>The estrogen level indicates it is.

520
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,820
<26-7,House>根本不是一回事
<26-7,House>It indicates something else entirely.

521
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:12,190
<26-8,Cameron>我们现在不能给他用干扰素
<26-8,Cameron>We can't give him interferon now.

522
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,950
<26-8,Cameron>他体内还存留着柴胡糖
<26-8,Cameron>There are still traces of the lozenges in his system.

523
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:16,880
<26-8,Cameron>-只会让他再次中毒  -基因
<26-8,Cameron>- It'll just poison him again. - Genetics.

524
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,740
<26-9,Chase>我们不治疗病毒  我们改变它
<26-9,Chase>We don't treat the virus, we change it.

525
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,560
<26-9,Chase>有种非核苷类变构酶抑制剂
<26-9,Chase>A non-nucleoside allosteric inhibitor.

526
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,800
<26-10,Foreman>从来没在人身上试过  可能会害死他
<26-10,Foreman>It's never been tried on a human being. It could kill him.

527
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,530
<26-11,Chase>有区别吗  不用他也死定了
<26-11,Chase>What's the difference? He's dead without it.

528
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,600
<26-12,Foreman>费城的圣塞巴斯蒂安医院
<26-12,Foreman>They're running a trial... on dogs

529
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:29,410
<26-12,Foreman>正在狗身上做试验
<26-12,Foreman>at St. Sebastian's out in Philadelphia.

530
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,850
<26-12,Foreman>我打电话问问
<26-12,Foreman>I'll make the call.

531
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:36,070
<26-13,House>还有哪种可能会使雌激素这么高
<26-13,House>What else could cause his estrogen level to be that high?

532
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,710
<26-14,Cameron>没了
<26-14,Cameron>Nothing.

533
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,340
<27-1,Chase>我们会把药打在这里
<27-1,Chase>We're gonna put the medicine in here.

534
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:04,860
<27-1,Chase>防止打进药时刺激静脉
<27-1,Chase>Don't want it to burn his veins when it goes in.

535
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,420
<27-2,Bill>你们根本没把握会有用
<27-2,Bill>And you have no idea if it'll work.

536
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:09,220
<27-3,Chase>试验阶段疗效很乐观
<27-3,Chase>It's shown promise in testing.

537
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:28,600
<28-1,Henry>可能里面没有东西  我像老鹰一样盯着他
<28-1,Henry>Ma-Maybe there's nothing up there. I watched him like a hawk.

538
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:32,080
<28-2,House>我敢肯定你没有
<28-2,House>Pretty sure you didn't.

539
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,390
<28-3,Henry>我没让他再玩小玩具
<28-3,Henry>I- I didn't let him play with any more little toys.

540
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,770
<28-4,House>于是他不得不把大玩具塞进去
<28-4,House>Thus forcing him to shove a big one up there.

541
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:42,520
<28-4,House>不许哭  否则我打断你鼻子
<28-4,House>Stop, or I snap your nose off!

542
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:55,510
<28-5,Henry>他不是太聪明的
<28-5,Henry>He- He's not too smart.

543
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:58,430
<28-6,House>遗传的威力很强大
<28-6,House>Genetics is a powerful force.

544
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:08,170
<28-6,House>反过来说  也许他比你想象中要聪明
<28-6,House>On the other hand, maybe he's smarter than you think.

545
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,110
<28-8,House>-怎么了  -等一会儿
<28-8,House>- What's goin' on? - Just give me a second.

546
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:20,120
<28-8,House>一直想用用这玩意儿
<28-8,House>Always wanted to use one of these.

547
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,930
<28-8,House>-把他的头朝后仰  -不要这样吧
<28-8,House>- Tilt his head back. - I- I don't know. I do-

548
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:31,220
<28-8,House>把他的头朝后仰
<28-8,House>Just tilt his head back.

549
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,820
<28-10,House>概念领会得真棒  各种关系
<28-10,House>Nice grasp of concepts. Relationships.

550
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,650
<28-10,House>很聪明  很酷
<28-10,House>Very smart. Very cool.

551
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:54,520
<28-10,House>先是警察  消防员  然后是消防车
<28-10,House>First the policeman, the fireman, then the fire truck.

552
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,230
<28-10,House>你弟弟派了一队人马去救这只猫
<28-10,House>Your brother was sending in teams to save the cat.

553
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:05,370
<28-12,House>有时  最简单的答案...
<28-12,House>Sometimes the simplest answer-

554
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,610
<29-1,House>哪一种昏迷人会自己醒过来
<29-1,House>What types of comas do you just snap out of?

555
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:52,510
<29-2,Chase>这一次他没醒过来  没有起色
<29-2,Chase>He's not snapping out of this one. He's not improving.

556
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:56,430
<29-2,Chase>你划掉了雌激素  有解释吗
<29-2,Chase>You've crossed out estrogen. You got an explanation?

557
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:58,690
<29-3,House>有  解释非常简单
<29-3,House>Yes, I have, a very simple one.

558
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:00,880
<29-4,Chase>是什么
<29-4,Chase>And?

559
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:02,910
<29-5,House>保密
<29-5,House>It's private.

560
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:10,460
<29-6,Chase>你认为是我  向沃格勒投诚
<29-6,Chase>You think I'm the one- running to Vogler.

561
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:13,440
<29-7,House>目前你嫌疑最大
<29-7,House>You're currently top of the list.

562
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,660
<29-7,House>中毒性昏迷
<29-7,House>Toxic comas-

563
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:19,580
<29-7,House>只要远离源头时间够久就会恢复
<29-7,House>Person's away from the cause long enough, they recover.

564
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,480
<29-8,Chase>联调局检查过毒素  我们也检查过
<29-8,Chase>The feds checked for poisons. We checked for poisons.

565
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:24,010
<29-8,Chase>不是我告密的
<29-8,Chase>I didn't do it.

566
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:27,060
<29-9,House>-那就不是中毒  -是过敏
<29-9,House>- It's not a poison then. - An allergy.

567
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:32,360
<29-11,House>-听到我说的吗  -会不会食物过敏
<29-11,House>- Did you hear me? - What about a food sensitivity?

568
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,270
<29-12,Chase>他吃的东西全都是严格管制的
<29-12,Chase>All his food is strictly controlled.

569
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,910
<29-12,Chase>他的饮食和病情并无关联
<29-12,Chase>There's no correlation between his meals and his condition.

570
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:39,670
<29-12,Chase>第一次昏迷之前  他吃了牛排和土豆
<29-12,Chase>He had steak and potatoes before the first coma,

571
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:41,930
<29-12,Chase>第二次昏迷之前  吃的是医院的鱼条
<29-12,Chase>and the hospital served fish sticks before the second one.

572
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:46,950
<29-12,Chase>你可以相信我
<29-12,Chase>You can trust me.

573
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:53,150
<29-13,House>问题是  如果我不能相信你
<29-13,House>Problem is, if I can't trust you,

574
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:55,690
<29-13,House>我就不能相信你说的"你可以相信我"
<29-13,House>I can't trust your statement that I can trust you.

575
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,630
<29-13,House>不过还是谢谢了  你帮了大忙
<29-13,House>But thanks anyway. You've been a big help.

576
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:13,380
<30-1,House>-你那钱是哪儿来的  -什么
<30-1,House>- So, where did you get the money? - What?

577
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,850
<30-3,House>-有人拿钱收买你  -你在胡说什么
<30-3,House>- Someone paid you off. - What are you talkin' about?

578
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:19,460
<30-4,Brady>他不是中毒  你告诉我们的...
<30-4,Brady>He wasn't poisoned. You told us that-

579
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:23,840
<30-5,House>谁在说中毒了  我说的是好处费  贿赂
<30-5,House>Who's talking about poison? I'm talking about payoffs, graft.

580
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:25,300
<30-6,Bill>不要烦他
<30-6,Bill>Leave him alone.

581
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,480
<30-7,House>原来是你贿赂了法警
<30-7,House>You paid the marshal off.

582
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:33,300
<30-8,Bill>我没付钱叫他给我弟弟下毒
<30-8,Bill>I didn't pay him to poison my brother.

583
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:35,370
<30-9,House>没有  但结果是这样
<30-9,House>No. It just worked out that way.

584
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:39,280
<30-10,Bill>我给他钱请他弄点好的饭菜进来
<30-10,Bill>I gave the guy some money to bring in some decent food.

585
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:43,000
<30-11,House>比鱼条更好的  我在想牛排
<30-11,House>Better than fish sticks? I'm thinking steak.

586
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:45,980
<30-12,Bill>我们要的是面条  可那些鸟警察才不在乎...
<30-12,Bill>We asked for pasta, but those stupid feds could care less-

587
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:48,040
<30-13,House>他两次昏迷前都吃了牛排
<30-13,House>He had steak before both comas.

588
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:52,310
<30-13,House>你弟弟有鸟氨酸氨甲酰转移酶缺乏症[O.T.D.]
<30-13,House>Your brother has ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency.

589
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:53,440
<30-13,House>要我写给你看吗
<30-13,House>Want me to write it down?

590
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,280
<30-13,House>好  因为写下来要花点时间
<30-13,House>Good, 'cause it takes a while.

591
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,550
<30-13,House>这是遗传疾病  随时有可能发作
<30-13,House>It's genetic, can present at any time.

592
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:00,870
<30-13,House>如果病人吃进去大量蛋白质
<30-13,House>If the patient eats a large amount of protein,

593
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:02,280
<30-13,House>尤其是他身体不适应的情况下
<30-13,House>especially if he's not used to it-

594
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:03,360
<30-13,House>什么  就这样
<30-13,House>What, that's it?

595
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,890
<30-14,Bill>他只要不吃红肉就没事了吗
<30-14,Bill>He just stays off the red meat, and he's gonna be fine?

596
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:09,610
<30-15,House>是的  如果我对了现在停止治疗  他就会好起来
<30-15,House>Yes. If I'm right and we stop the current treatment, he gets better.

597
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:13,280
<30-15,House>但如果我错了而停止治疗  那他就会死
<30-15,House>If we stop the current treatment and I'm wrong, he dies.

598
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:16,710
<30-16,Bill>-你怎么会错  -他的雌激素水平
<30-16,Bill>- Why would you be wrong? - His estrogen level.

599
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:19,180
<30-17,House>这种病不影响雌激素水平
<30-17,House>O.T.D. Doesn't explain his estrogen level.

600
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:22,200
<30-17,House>但是  我有个理论
<30-17,House>But I have a theory.

601
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:26,370
<30-17,House>有那么种化学物质  如果摄入人体
<30-17,House>There is one chemical that, if ingested,

602
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:29,330
<30-17,House>可能引起雌激素水平急剧上升
<30-17,House>can cause a person's estrogen level to increase dramatically.

603
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:32,610
<30-18,Bill>-是什么  -就叫雌性激素
<30-18,Bill>- What is it? - It's called estrogen.

604
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:38,010
<30-20,Bill>乔伊使用雌性激素  怎么  他想变性不成
<30-20,Bill>Joey's taking estrogen? What, he wants a sex change?

605
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,540
<30-21,House>不  倒不是这个
<30-21,House>No, nothing like that.

606
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:42,690
<30-21,House>它叫作"雄性火焰"
<30-21,House>It's called "Male Flame."

607
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:47,150
<30-21,House>用中国原话讲可能更好理解
<30-21,House>It's probably more consumer-friendly in the original Chinese.

608
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:51,820
<30-21,House>-是一种草本春药  卖给男同志的  -开始扯了
<30-21,House>- It's an herbal aphrodisiac marketed to gay men. - Ah, here we go.

609
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:55,150
<30-23,House>卖柴胡糖的同一家网站就有
<30-23,House>And it's sold on the same Web site that sells his Chai Hu lozenges.

610
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:58,320
<30-23,House>你猜它成分是什么  "雌"打头的
<30-23,House>Guess what's in it? It starts with an "E."

611
00:35:58,610 --> 00:35:59,670
<30-24,Bill>你也找打吗
<30-24,Bill>You wanna get hit too?

612
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,250
<30-25,House>这招说不定也很奏效啊
<30-25,House>That would be quite a trick.

613
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:04,780
<30-25,House>他狠狠地揍了我  于是他的哥哥变直男了
<30-25,House>He slapped me so hard, his brother turned straight.

614
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:09,050
<30-25,House>乔伊是黑帮大佬  像他这样的人在监狱里不会被强暴
<30-25,House>Joey's a big-time mobster. Guys like that don't get raped in prison.

615
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:12,850
<30-25,House>大家要讨好他  送礼物  送食物  毒品  香烟
<30-25,House>They get gifts. They get food, drugs, cigarettes.

616
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,070
<30-25,House>还有电视看
<30-25,House>Cable TV.

617
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:19,960
<30-26,Bill>乔伊不是同志
<30-26,Bill>Joey is not gay.

618
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:23,280
<30-27,House>就算不是同志吧  但肯定相当愉快
<30-27,House>Maybe not gay, but certainly delightful.

620
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:28,600
<30-27,House>相反你呢  殴打医生  哪怕只是奇斯
<30-27,House>You, on the other hand, hitting a doctor, even if it was only Chase,

621
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:29,610
<30-27,House>而且威胁另一个医生
<30-27,House>and asking another one

622
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:32,910
<30-27,House>给乔伊的病例作假不许写他是同志
<30-27,House>to keep Joey's chart fresh and homo-free-

623
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,360
<30-27,House>这反应有点过头了  你说呢
<30-27,House>that's a bit of an overreaction, wouldn't you say?

624
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,290
<30-27,House>好像你害怕这是真的
<30-27,House>It's almost like you're scared that it might be true.

625
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:38,660
<30-28,Bill>你错了
<30-28,Bill>You're wrong.

626
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,320
<30-29,House>好  那就不要停止治疗
<30-29,House>Okay. Then don't stop the treatment.

627
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:48,190
<30-29,House>但如果是你错了  他会死
<30-29,House>But if you're wrong, he dies.

628
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:17,770
<30-29,House>好吧
<30-29,House>Okay.

629
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:37,570
<31-1,Bill>他从来没和我说过  一次都没有
<31-1,Bill>He never said anything to me about it, not once.

630
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:46,040
<31-2,House>我就喜欢你们帮派分子这一点  很能宽容他人
<31-2,House>That's what I love about you mob guys, so tolerant of others.

631
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:47,570
<31-2,House>很能接受现实
<31-2,House>So accepting.

632
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:51,930
<31-2,House>他抽身的唯一办法就是跑得远远的
<31-2,House>Only way he was coming out was way, way out.

633
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:56,300
<31-2,House>洗掉纹身  改名换姓  搬到别处去
<31-2,House>Lose the tattoos, change his name, move to another town.

634
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:58,900
<31-2,House>可他这样的人怎么会这么做呢
<31-2,House>How's a guy like him gonna do that?

635
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:02,020
<31-2,House>证人保护计划
<31-2,House>Witness Protection.

636
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:04,900
<31-2,House>不再是仅仅为了证人
<31-2,House>It's not just for witnesses anymore.

637
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:07,740
<31-3,Chase>现在可以进去了  你愿意坐下陪陪他也行
<31-3,Chase>You can go in now, sit with him if you want.

638
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:32,510
<32-2,Foreman>-他还有多久会醒  -才过了三个小时
<32-2,Foreman>- How much longer? - It's only been three hours.

639
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:35,090
<32-3,Bill>-如果是O.T.D.  -什么叫如果是
<32-3,Bill>- If it's the O.T.D. - If it's the O.T.D.?

640
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:37,580
<32-3,Bill>万一豪斯错了呢
<32-3,Bill>What if House is wrong, huh?

641
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,480
<32-4,Foreman>像这么严重的反应  需要时间恢复
<32-4,Foreman>That severe a reaction, it'll take some time-

642
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,960
<32-5,Bill>他总是对人做出各种假设  然后说服别人
<32-5,Bill>He makes these assumptions about people, talks you into things-

643
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:47,510
<32-6,Cameron>阿奈罗先生  他醒了  他想见你
<32-6,Cameron>Mr. Arnello- He's awake. He wants to see you.

644
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:56,990
<32-6,Cameron>你看起来一团糟
<32-6,Cameron>You look like crap.

645
00:38:58,590 --> 00:39:01,640
<33-1,Joey>这是个笑话  听出来没  我生病了  可我说你糟糕
<33-1,Joey>That's a joke. See? I'm sick. I said you look like crap.

646
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,700
<33-2,Bill>你不知道我刚才经历了什么
<33-2,Bill>You have no idea what I just went through out there.

647
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:07,270
<33-2,Bill>你的病不断加重
<33-2,Bill>You kept gettin' worse.

648
00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:10,800
<33-2,Bill>豪斯医生不断说那些狗屁不通的话
<33-2,Bill>And Dr. House kept sayin' all this crap.

649
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:15,230
<33-2,Bill>你知不知道  如果我坚持说你正常
<33-2,Bill>You know, if- if I think you're normal,

650
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,510
<33-2,Bill>那他就会继续给你用药
<33-2,Bill>then he's gonna keep giving you the medicine.

651
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:18,400
<33-2,Bill>-如果你不...  -不什么
<33-2,Bill>- If you weren't- - Weren't what?

652
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:22,790
<33-3,Joey>不正常
<33-3,Joey>Normal?

653
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,130
<33-3,Joey>是的
<33-3,Joey>Yeah.

654
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:30,600
<33-4,Bill>他说你是个基佬
<33-4,Bill>He said you were a fag.

655
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,370
<33-4,Bill>证人保护计划  这是你当同志的好机会
<33-4,Bill>Witness Protection- that's your big chance to be one.

656
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,480
<33-6,Bill>-你信了他的话  -我不知道要信什么好
<33-6,Bill>- You believed him? - I don't know what to believe.

657
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:42,670
<33-6,Bill>你病得那么重
<33-6,Bill>You were sick.

658
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:48,100
<33-6,Bill>我必须做出决定  我当时以为你快死了
<33-6,Bill>I had to make a decision. I thought you were gonna die.

659
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,130
<33-7,Joey>你相信了他
<33-7,Joey>You believed him.

660
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:58,720
<33-7,Joey>他停了药
<33-7,Joey>He stopped the medicine.

661
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:01,820
<33-7,Joey>现在我醒了
<33-7,Joey>Here I am.

662
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:13,330
<33-7,Joey>-我想和你谈谈这事  -没什么好谈的
<33-7,Joey>- I wanted to talk to you about this. - There's nothin' to talk about.

663
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:21,200
<33-8,Bill>你...
<33-8,Bill>You, uh,

664
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,670
<33-8,Bill>从网上买了些破中医保健品
<33-8,Bill>ordered some Chinese internet health crap,

679
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,350
<34-2,House>不过幸好有你为我争取  对吧
<34-2,House>Good thing you fought for me though, right?

680
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:52,670
<34-2,House>穿工作服我这一步走得不错  但你得顺势煽风点火
<34-2,House>Dress was a nice move, but you gotta follow it up.

681
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,190
<34-2,House>维加斯之邪恶周末
<34-2,House>Nasty weekend in Vegas.

682
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:59,040
<34-2,House>展示你真正行政能力的时候

<34-4,House>你也要办个欢送会吧
<34-4,House>And I assume you're gonna want to throw a party.

<34-5,Cuddy>我告诉他我知道他的那些肮脏内幕
<34-5,Cuddy>I told him I know where the bodies are buried.

689
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,290
<34-5,Cuddy>还有那些他在书本上学不到的本事

<34-6,House>他还留着你
<34-6,House>He's only keeping you on

692
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,020
<34-6,House>只是因为你知道那些秘密
<34-6,House>because you know the secret handshakes.

693
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:27,660
<34-6,House>但他学得快  不消六个月的功夫
<34-6,House>He's a quick study. Six months,

694
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:29,320
<34-6,House>等他全部掌握  他就不再需要你了
<34-6,House>he'll have the moves down. He won't need you anymore.

<34-7,Cuddy>-我到时再想办法对付  -那我可以留下
<34-7,Cuddy>- I'll deal with that then. - So I stay.

697
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,060

<35-3,House>-一切围绕利润转  -是啊  真新奇
<35-3,House>- Everything's about profits. - Yeah, that's real new.

00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:47,250
<35-4,Wilson>你可以偶尔把你那辆克尔维特租出去
<35-4,Wilson>You could rent out the Corvette every once in a while

701
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,520
<35-4,Wilson>或者借给朋友
<35-4,Wilson>or lend it to a friend.

702
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:51,210
<35-5,House>那很容易  但很不对
<35-5,House>That would be easy, and it would be wrong.

703
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:52,660
<35-6,Wilson>可人家卡迪为你挺身而出
<35-6,Wilson>But Cuddy stood up for you.

704
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:54,590
<35-7,House>不完全是

705
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,070
<35-8,Wilson>怎么不完全
<35-8,Wilson>To what point?

<35-9,House>我每个月要多做六小时门诊  还有他们中的两个
<35-9,House>I gotta do six more clinic hours a month. So do two of them.

707
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,240
<35-10,Wilson>为什么只有两个
<35-10,Wilson>Why only two?

708
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,220
<35-11,House>因为有一个要离开这里
<35-11,House>'Cause one of them's gone.

709
00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:09,720
<35-11,House>我必须炒掉一个人
<35-11,House>I gotta fire somebody.
