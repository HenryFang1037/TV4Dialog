<7-3,Thirteen>那么我们都是两个人abc只是我们不自知罢了
<7-3,Thirteen>then we're all two people,And we just don't know it.

128
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:18,030
<7-3,Thirteen>我们该认同哪一个身份?
<7-3,Thirteen>What does that say about identity?

129
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:23,160
<7-4,Taub>这只是...人类在自身发展中abc编出来的一套 完全不会困扰我
<7-4,Taub>It says...We're making it up  as we go along,Which I find freeing.

<7-4,Taub>自从搬出医学院的宿舍后abc我就没进过这么小的浴室
<7-4,Taub>Wow,i haven't been in a bathroom this size  Since my dorm in med school.

131
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,760
<7-4,Taub>那些是真菌吗?
<7-4,Taub>Is that fungus?

132
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:32,380
<7-5,Thirteen>是水蒸汽造成的
<7-5,Thirteen>It's from the steam buildup.

133

<7-6,Taub>Chase和Cameron的婚礼出问题了abc你有什么看法?
<7-6,Taub>What do you think of this glitch  With chase and cameron's wedding?

134
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:42,890
<7-7,Thirteen>两个人好端端的 又扯上了精子的事 abc怪可惜的
<7-7,Thirteen>It's always a sad thing when sperm comes between people.

135
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:48,390
<8-1,Taub>我听说今天的"精子"很不错
<8-1,Taub>I hear the sperm is very good today.

136
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,050
<8-1,Taub>我指三文鱼
<8-1,Taub>I mean the salmon.

137
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,670
<8-2,Chase>走开

138

<8-3,Taub>别桌满了

139

<8-4,Chase>以防万一吗?
<8-4,Chase>next to the frozen peas just in case?

141
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:08,110
<8-4,Chase>就是这么一回事
<8-4,Chase>That's what this is about.

142
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,900
<8-4,Chase>她还没准备好对我作出承诺
<8-4,Chase>She's not ready to commit to me.

143
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:11,870
<8-4,Chase>她作好了失败告终的打算
<8-4,Chase>She's planning for failure.

144
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:15,850
<8-5,Taub>你有没听说过abc雄性果蝇会在精液里释放毒素
<8-5,Taub>Did you know that male fruit flies  have toxic chemicals in their seminal fluid

145
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:18,770
<8-5,Taub>好杀死其它雄果蝇的精子?
<8-5,Taub>That inhibit the sperm of other males?

146
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,680
<9-1,House>Wilson说我们得谈谈
<9-1,House>Wilson says we need to talk.

147
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:32,410
<9-2,Cuddy>- 我们谈过了abc- 我也这么说
<9-2,Cuddy>- We talked.  - I agree.

148
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:37,460
<9-3,House>显然我们已经过了谈的阶段
<9-3,House>This has clearly gotten past the talking stage.

149
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,130
<9-4,Cuddy>搞什么?
<9-4,Cuddy>What?

150

<9-4,Cuddy>嘿 太好了
<9-4,Cuddy>Hey.Great.

152
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,720
<10-1,Scott>没有
<10-1,Scott>Uh,not yet.

153

<10-2,Annie>And this cactus from your window.

156
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:01,550
<10-3,Scott>你没必要这么做abc这些东西医院都有
<10-3,Scott>You didn't have to do that,really. The hospital supplies all that stuff.

157
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,810
<10-4,Annie>为了让另一半的你也喜欢我
<10-4,Annie>I'm still trying too hard,huh?

158
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:05,500
<10-4,Annie>我未免太煞费心思了 对吧?
<10-4,Annie>Trying to get your other half to like me.

159
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:07,420
<10-5,Scott>别这么说 好吗?
<10-5,Scott>Don't say that,okay?

160
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,940
<10-5,Scott>我喜欢你
<10-5,Scott>I like you.

161
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:14,520
<10-5,Scott>也就是说-- 你别想太多
<10-5,Scott>Which means that-- We shouldn't read into that.

162
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,910
<10-6,Thirteen>抗真菌药物
<10-6,Thirteen>Anti-fungal meds.

163
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,700
<10-6,Thirteen>通常我们会用静脉注射
<10-6,Thirteen>Ordinarily,we'd put them in your iv,

164
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,400
<10-6,Thirteen>但看来你的右脑不大喜欢打点滴...
<10-6,Thirteen>But since your right brain doesn't seem too fond of ivs...

165
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,650
<10-6,Thirteen>过几天你就会好起来了
<10-6,Thirteen>You should be feeling better in a few days.

166
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,060
<10-6,Thirteen>我得回去上班了
<10-6,Thirteen>I have to get back to work.

167
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,720
<10-7,Annie>Rick说你的工作还等着你回去干呢
<10-7,Annie>Rick says your shift will be waiting for you  When you get back.

<10-10,Scott>Babe,wait,hold on!No,it wasn't me!

175
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:46,140
<10-10,Scott>我不能走路了
<10-10,Scott>I can't walk.

176
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,770
<11-1,Taub>显然不是真菌导致的
<11-1,Taub>Well,obviously,it wasn't the fungus.

177
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:53,210
<11-2,Thirteen>也不是协调性的问题
<11-2,Thirteen>And it's not a coordination issues.

178
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,920
<11-2,Thirteen>脱水会使身体失去平衡abc我们还没给他打过点滴
<11-2,Thirteen>Dehydration can cause loss of balance. We haven't had him on iv.

<11-3,Foreman>No,good skin turgor.

180
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:58,720
<11-3,Foreman>不是直立性低血压
<11-3,Foreman>Not orthostatic.

181
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,290
<11-4,House>说不定我们缴的税派上用场了
<11-4,House>Could be our tax dollars at work.

182
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:04,480
<11-4,House>造出了新的公路和桥梁
<11-4,House>Constantly building new roadways and bridges.

00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:06,800
<11-5,Thirteen>脑膜瘤 慢性生长
<11-5,Thirteen>A meningioma.Slow growing.

184
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:10,910
<11-4,House>可能会扩散到颅腔的软骨后abc被颅骨隐藏起来
<11-4,House>Could extend along the subosteal layer Of  the cranial cavity and be hidden by the bone.

185
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,040
<11-5,Thirteen>癌细胞会在左右脑之间重新搭起通路
<11-5,Thirteen>The cancer cells are actually re-growing  a connection Between the left and right hemispheres.

186
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,740
<11-6,Foreman>如果你是对的 两半大脑会再度对话
<11-6,Foreman>If you're right,the two halves have begun Sending messages again,

187
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:20,260
<11-6,Foreman>但在现阶段 他还无法感知 但是...
<11-6,Foreman>but it's too early In the process for him to pick up on it But...

188
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,910
<11-6,Foreman>我们可以做个测试
<11-6,Foreman>We can test for it.

189
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,800
<12-1,House>证据在此
<12-1,House>Proof.

190
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,950
<12-2,Wilson>你没找她谈 对吧?
<12-2,Wilson>You didn't talk to her,did you?

191
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:35,650
<12-3,House>如果找她谈 她会说谎 我也会说谎
<12-3,House>If I talked,she'd have lied,i'd have lied.

192
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,750
<12-3,House>虽说负负可以得正
<12-3,House>And though two negatives make a positive,

193
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:40,320
<12-3,House>但我想 拍张热成像照片来得更直接
<12-3,House>I thought thermal imaging photos seemed simpler.

194
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,030
<12-3,House>和我呆了不到一分钟后abc她的发热区骤然增加
<12-3,House>Note how many more heated areas appear  After less than a minute with me.

195
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:46,910
<12-4,Wilson>这可能是出于爱 也有可能是愤怒
<12-4,Wilson>So it's either love or possibly rage.

196
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,600
<12-5,House>你别找她谈
<12-5,House>Don't talk to her.

197
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:50,180
<12-6,Wilson>我没打算找她谈
<12-6,Wilson>I he no plans to talk to her.

198
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:52,140
<12-7,House>掺和别人的事是你的天性
<12-7,House>Manipulation is in your genetic code.

199
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,900
<12-7,House>你认为我做错了abc所以要把它往正路上掰
<12-7,House>You think i'm making a mistake,you move in to correct.

200
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:54,990
<12-8,Wilson>你这么做的确错了
<12-8,Wilson>You are making a mistake.

201
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,170
<12-9,House>她撒谎了
<12-9,House>She lied to me.

202
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,830
<12-9,House>要么是昨晚 要么是今天
<12-9,House>Either last night or today.

203
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,130
<12-9,House>我得搞清楚是哪次 还有为什么
<12-9,House>I need to find out which and why.

204
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:01,320
<12-10,Wilson>显然热成像是最佳办法
<12-10,Wilson>And clearly,thermal imaging is the way.

205
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,640
<12-10,Wilson>这不是一个病例
<12-10,Wilson>This isn't a case.

206
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:03,990
<12-10,Wilson>你也不是要找诊治方案
<12-10,Wilson>You're not looking for a diagnosis.

207
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,690
<12-10,Wilson>如果你重视这段关系
<12-10,Wilson>If this matters at all to you,

208
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:09,380
<12-10,Wilson>拜托 哪怕仅此一次 abc用成年人的方式处理
<12-10,Wilson>Please,for once in your life,be an adult.

<13-1,Foreman>眼睛紧盯着加号
<13-1,Foreman>Keep your eyes focused on the plus sign.

<13-1,Foreman>在你右侧出现的符号abc只有你的右脑能看见
<13-1,Foreman>Any image that appears on your far right  Will only be seen by your left brain.

<13-1,Foreman>在左侧出现的符号abc也只有左脑能看见
<13-1,Foreman>And any image on your far left  Will only be seen by your right brain.

212
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:23,310
<13-2,Scott>好的
<13-2,Scott>Okay.

213
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,100
<13-3,Foreman>我们从报单词开始
<13-3,Foreman>Just start by saying the words.

214

<13-4,Scott>书本

218
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:40,420
<13-5,Foreman>你没有念出那个单词
<13-5,Foreman>You're not saying the word.

219
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,480
<13-6,Scott>我没看到单词
<13-6,Scott>I didn't see a word.

220

<13-7,Foreman>你能不能画出这个单词所代表的物体?
<13-7,Foreman>Could you draw a picture Of  what you think the word might be?

221

<13-9,Taub>This is so cool.

224
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:01,420
<13-10,Thirteen>没错 一点也不可怕
<13-10,Thirteen>Yeah,that's not freaky at all.

00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:04,120
<13-11,Foreman>没有交流

00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:17,620
<13-13,Foreman>Scott 你为什么要站起来?
<13-13,Foreman>Scott,why are you standing?

228
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:22,060
<13-14,Scott>我觉得有点冷

<13-15,Foreman>再等一会儿
<13-15,Foreman>A few more minutes.

<13-16,House>看好了 女士们先生们 abc这就是左脑的作用...
<13-16,House>And that,ladies and gentlemen,Is the left hemisphere...

232
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:34,860
<13-16,House>孜孜以求地寻找答案
<13-16,House>The side that's obsessed with finding answers,

233
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,820
<13-16,House>追求凡事的合理化abc负责解释一切
<13-16,House>The one that needs things to make sense,the interpreter.

234

<13-16,House>告诉我们 我们是谁abc以及我们在干什么
<13-16,House>That's where we tell the story Of who we are and why we do things.

235
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,520
<13-17,Taub>但出错的也是它
<13-17,Taub>That's also the side that was wrong.

236

<13-17,Taub>右脑的优势在于不循逻辑思考
<13-17,Taub>Right brain's advantage is that it isn't logical,

237
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,890
<13-17,Taub>不是从个别细节中得出结论
<13-17,Taub>Doesn't choose which details to look at,

238
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,930
<13-17,Taub>而是找出隐含的联系
<13-17,Taub>Makes connections you could never see.

239
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:50,850
<13-17,Taub>你低估了"沉默的失败者"的作用
<13-17,Taub>You owe your insight to the "mute loser.

240
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,740
<13-18,House>那我送它一张费城球票作为补偿好了
<13-18,House>" i'll send it tickets to a phillies game.

241
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:56,270
<13-19,Thirteen>虚构症状说明左右脑没有交流abc也就是说 你的猜测是错误的
<13-19,Thirteen>Confabulation means no communication.Means your theory's wrong.

242
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:02,730
<13-20,House>但他的确觉得冷
<13-20,House>But he is cold.

243
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:12,840
<13-20,House>你为什么要挠?
<13-20,House>Why are you scratching?

244
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,350
<13-21,Scott>很痒
<13-21,Scott>It itches.

245
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:16,020
<13-22,House>呼气有氨味
<13-22,House>Ammonia breath.

246
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,310
<13-22,House>你的肝正在衰竭
<13-22,House>Your liver is failing.

247
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:31,540
<14-1,Wilson>得让他们看统计数字abc才会批这个价格
<14-1,Wilson>I know for them to approve this price, They'll need statistical documentation.

248
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,130
<14-1,Wilson>怎么了?
<14-1,Wilson>What?

249
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:34,520
<14-1,Wilson>干嘛盯着我看?
<14-1,Wilson>Why are you looking at me?

250
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:38,310
<14-2,Cuddy>你一进门我就看出来了 你想说的...
<14-2,Cuddy>When you first walked in,I was under the impression you wanted to...

251
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:40,260
<14-2,Cuddy>是别的事情
<14-2,Cuddy>Say something else.

252
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:41,550
<14-3,Wilson>没
<14-3,Wilson>Nope.

253
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,220
<14-4,Cuddy>关于House和我
<14-4,Cuddy>About house and me.

254
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:45,740
<14-5,Wilson>没什么好谈的
<14-5,Wilson>There's nothing to talk about.

255
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:54,030
<14-6,House>我要求做个肝脏活检
<14-6,House>I want permission to do a liver biopsy.

256
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,720
<14-6,House>怀疑是结节病
<14-6,House>We're looking for sarcoidosis.

257
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,080
<14-7,Cuddy>好
<14-7,Cuddy>Fine.

258
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:58,920
<14-8,House>什么叫"好"?
<14-8,House>What do you mean,fine?

259
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:00,230
<14-8,House>你说什么叫"好"?
<14-8,House>What do you mean what do I mean?

260
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:03,740
<14-9,Cuddy>你是说 因为肝脏活检
<14-9,Cuddy>Do you mean because a liver biopsy Is not a test that

261
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:06,330
<14-9,Cuddy>无论怎么想 都不算危险的检查
<14-9,Cuddy>by any stretch of the imagination, Can be considered risky,

262
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,730
<14-9,Cuddy>所以要求我批准实际是浪费我时间
<14-9,Cuddy>So asking my permission is essentially wasting my time,

263
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,150
<14-9,Cuddy>而你想看看我如何反应?
<14-9,Cuddy>And you're wondering what my reaction to that will be?

264
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,530
<14-10,House>是
<14-10,House>Yes.

265
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,440
<14-11,Cuddy>你是想惹我生气?
<14-11,Cuddy>Are you trying to make me angry?

266
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,300
<14-12,House>是
<14-12,House>Yes.

267
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:17,640
<14-13,Cuddy>做你的活检去 还有门诊工作
<14-13,Cuddy>Do your biopsy.And also do your clinic hours.

268
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:18,990
<14-14,House>我不做门诊
<14-14,House>I'm blowing off my clinic hours.

269
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,370
<14-15,Cuddy>是么? 那我们走着瞧
<14-15,Cuddy>Really?Let's see how that goes.

270
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,530
<14-15,Cuddy>还是没生气
<14-15,Cuddy>Still not angry.

271
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,860
<14-15,Cuddy>一会再试试
<14-15,Cuddy>Try again later.

272
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:43,040
<15-1,Scott>抱歉 我知道我有点体臭
<15-1,Scott>Sorry.I know i'm a little ripe.

273
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:44,730
<15-1,Scott>经常出汗
<15-1,Scott>Just a sweaty guy.

274
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,710
<15-2,Thirteen>- 最近?abc- 一直
<15-2,Thirteen>Recently? - Always.

275
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:50,260
<15-3,Scott>嗯 还有只不听使唤的左手
<15-3,Scott>Uh,with a crazy left hand.

276
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,670
<15-3,Scott>有时我幻想着砍掉它
<15-3,Scott>Sometimes I fantasize about cutting it off.

277
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,510
<15-3,Scott>幻想而已
<15-3,Scott>Just a fantasy.

278
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,910
<15-3,Scott>手疯了 我还没
<15-3,Scott>It's the hand that's crazy,not me.

279
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,030
<15-3,Scott>干吗?
<15-3,Scott>What?

280
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:05,300
<15-4,Taub>它连超声棒都打 对针头会什么反应?
<15-4,Taub>If it doesn't like an ultrasound wand, How's it gonna react to a needle?

281
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,070
<15-5,Scott>能在这屋里放音乐不?
<15-5,Scott>Can you get music into this room?

282
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:13,740
<15-5,Scott>我觉得你是利用跟Cuddy的关系abc来替代药物了
<15-5,Scott>I think you're using your relationship  with cuddy As a replacement for drugs.

283
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:16,260
<16-1,Wilson>戒毒本该让你迅速进入强烈痛苦中
<16-1,Wilson>You should be in more pain so soon into detoxing,

284
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:18,660
<16-1,Wilson>但你的体内却充满了浪漫内啡肽
<16-1,Wilson>But your body's full of romantic endorphins.

285
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:23,100
<16-1,Wilson>最重要的是abc你还用寻找证据来分散注意力
<16-1,Wilson>And on top of that,You create this distraction of looking for proof.

286
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:25,760
<16-2,House>你觉得我该停手 好让痛苦涌现?
<16-2,House>Think I should stop and let the pain flood back?

287
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:28,120
<16-3,Wilson>Cuddy不是维柯丁替代品
<16-3,Wilson>Cuddy is not a vicodin substitute.

288
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,050
<16-4,House>恰恰相反
<16-4,House>Quite the opposite.

289
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:31,620
<16-5,Wilson>你必须等她准备好
<16-5,Wilson>You have to wait for her to be ready.

290
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:33,000
<16-6,House>建议不错
<16-6,House>Great advice.

291
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:34,640
<16-6,House>当作我听从好了
<16-6,House>You pretend that i'm gonna do that.

292
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:37,330
<16-7,Wilson>你已经做了两个重大的人生改变
<16-7,Wilson>You've made two major changes in your life.

293
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:39,310
<16-7,Wilson>这时候任何人都做不了最佳抉择
<16-7,Wilson>Not a time anyone's judgment is at its best.

294
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,510
<16-8,House>你以前不是常说abc我不吃药 判断力会更好吗?
<16-8,House>Didn't you use to argue That my judgment would be better off drugs?

295
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,590
<16-8,House>承认吧 -- 你好奇我干嘛非惹她生气
<16-8,House>Admit it--you're curious why I wanna make her angry.

296
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:48,210
<16-9,Wilson>我肯定原因很纠结 错误 还愚蠢
<16-9,Wilson>I'm sure it's convoluted,wrong,and stupid.

297
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:50,530
<16-10,House>你特想知道我在她咖啡杯里abc发现了什么吧
<16-10,House>You're dying to know what I found on her coffee cup.

298
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:51,430
<16-11,Wilson>才不
<16-11,Wilson>No.

299
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,610
<16-12,House>- 因为 --abc- 催产素
<16-12,House>Because-- oxytocin.

300
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,450
<16-12,House>催产素...
<16-12,House>Oxytocin...

301
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:03,400
<16-13,Wilson>一种与情感联结有关的化学物质?
<16-13,Wilson>The chemical involved in emotional bonding?

302
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,690
<16-14,House>她嘴上说不...
<16-14,House>Her lips say no...

303
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:07,300
<16-14,House>荷尔蒙却大喊"哦也 再来!"
<16-14,House>Her hormones say,"oh,my god,yes,more!

304
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:09,820
<16-15,Wilson>不对 要确定她指数上升
<16-15,Wilson>" no.For you to know her levels were elevated

305
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:11,690
<16-15,Wilson>你必须知道她正常状况数值 作对比
<16-15,Wilson>You'd need a base line to compare them with.

306
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:15,500
<16-16,House>我付钱让健身房的一家伙abc从垃圾桶里取回了一个她喝过的水瓶
<16-16,House>I paid the guy in the gym To retrieve  one of her water bottles from the trash.

307
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:18,180
<16-17,Wilson>爱让人无所不能
<16-17,Wilson>Love inspires us to greatness.

308
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,540
<16-18,House>所以我要让她情绪失控...
<16-18,House>So I need to make her lose her temper...

309
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,240
<16-18,House>好破碎她的错觉 向我和她证明
<16-18,House>Which breaks her delusion,Which demonstrates to me and to her

310
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:25,660
<16-18,House>外表之下暗生情愫
<16-18,House>That there is something underneath this facade.

311
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:28,650
<16-19,Wilson>然后呢? 她承认一切 投入你怀抱?
<16-19,Wilson>And then what happens?She admits everything and falls into your arms?

312
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,740
<16-20,House>这是可能性一 可能性二...
<16-20,House>That's outcome one.Outcome two...

313
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:32,130
<16-20,House>是她杀了我
<16-20,House>Is she kills me.

314
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,870
<16-20,House>我看眼下是对半的可能
<16-20,House>I think it's 50/50 right now.

315
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,460
<16-21,Wilson>很好
<16-21,Wilson>Great.

316
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,270
<16-22,House>我知道你会这么说!
<16-22,House>I thought you'd say that!

317
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:42,270
<16-23,Wilson>你肯将自己承诺给 -- 一个人
<16-23,Wilson>You're committing yourself to something-- someone.

318
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:47,150
<16-23,Wilson>虽说 方式幼稚 但毕竟是好事
<16-23,Wilson>I mean,it's childish in a way,But ultimately great.

319
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:49,000
<16-23,Wilson>假设...
<16-23,Wilson>Assuming...

320
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:52,300
<16-23,Wilson>你真的希望自己成功?
<16-23,Wilson>Are you absolutely sure you want this to succeed?

321
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,430
<16-24,House>为什么有一老头站我门口?
<16-24,House>Why is an old guy standing in my doorway?

322
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:57,610
<16-24,House>Eugene Schwartz
<16-24,House>Eugene schwartz.

323
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,390
<16-25,Eugene>Eugene Schwartz
<16-25,Eugene>Eugene schwartz.

324
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:03,220
<16-25,Eugene>Cuddy医生让我到这看门诊
<16-25,Eugene>Dr. Cuddy asked me to come up here from the clinic.

325
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:06,000
<16-25,Eugene>她说你在办公室接待门诊
<16-25,Eugene>She says you're seeing patients in your office.

326
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,800
<16-25,Eugene>这样还是免费的吧?
<16-25,Eugene>It's still free,though,isn't it?

327
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,150
<16-26,House>她让他到这来
<16-26,House>She sent him.

328
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:11,290
<16-26,House>其中肯定有奥妙
<16-26,House>That's gotta mean something.

329
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:13,540
<16-27,Wilson>我去找我的解谜魔戒
<16-27,Wilson>I'll go get my decoder ring.

330

<16-28,Eugene>像只鹦鹉
<16-28,Eugene>Like a parrot.

332
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:24,350
<16-28,Eugene>不对 不是这样
<16-28,Eugene>No,that's not it.

333
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:25,590
<16-28,Eugene>几个月前开始的
<16-28,Eugene>It started a few months ago.

334
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:27,800
<16-28,Eugene>我在车库里做木匠活
<16-28,Eugene>I was doing some woodworking in my garage.

335
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:29,540
<16-28,Eugene>试着做把椅子
<16-28,Eugene>I was trying to make a chair.

336
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:32,050
<16-28,Eugene>是椅子还是?
<16-28,Eugene>Was it the chair?

337
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:34,480
<16-28,Eugene>不管了 反正就是突然间
<16-28,Eugene>Anyway,all of a sudden,from nowhere,

338
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,700
<16-28,Eugene>这个奇怪的嗓音从我口中爆出 -- 嗑!
<16-28,Eugene>This strange noise comes bursting out of my mouth-- Caaaww!

339
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,470
<16-28,Eugene>很难模拟
<16-28,Eugene>Tough to fake that.

340
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,090
<16-29,House>裤子不错
<16-29,House>Nice pants.

341
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,810
<16-30,Eugene>我老伴Mona说 我快把她骨头震断了
<16-30,Eugene>My wife mona thinks i'm bustin' her chops.

<16-30,Eugene>严重影响我婚姻
<16-30,Eugene>It's ruining my marriage.

343
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,930
<16-30,Eugene>我们去哪?
<16-30,Eugene>Where are we going?

344
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:58,070
<17-1,Taub>你左手更愿意对空弹吉他abc而非阻挠我检查?
<17-1,Taub>So your left hand would rather play air guitar Than give me a hard time?

345
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:01,320
<17-2,Scott>它对空气吉他的欲望胜过abc系鞋带 拿刀叉...
<17-2,Scott>It'd rather play air guitar than tie shoes,eat dinner...

346
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,000
<17-3,Thirteen>你右手也在弹
<17-3,Thirteen>Your right hand's playing too.

347
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:05,770
<17-4,Scott>我不想打击左手
<17-4,Scott>I don't wanna discourage it.

348
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:15,100
<17-5,Thirteen>他指甲下有裂痕出血
<17-5,Thirteen>splinter hemorrhages under his fingernails.

<20-4,Scott>你说过肝素可以防止新血块形成
<20-4,Scott>You said the heparin would keep new clots from forming.

388
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:54,070
<20-5,Thirteen>也许 但显然还有东西在引发凝血
<20-5,Thirteen>Maybe.But something's obviously causing the clots.

<20-10,Taub>你没要离开 除非你是想裸奔
<20-10,Taub>You're not goin' anywhere Unless you wanna go naked.

<23-17,Taub>扫描很正常 不是胰腺癌
<23-17,Taub>Scan's clean. It's not pancreatic cancer.

462
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:36,210
<24-1,House>在形成肿瘤之前 凝血也可能是问题所在
<24-1,House>Clotting could be a problem well before a solid tumor forms.

463
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,420
<24-1,House>病根很可能还是胰腺
<24-1,House>It can still be pancreatic.

464
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:40,510
<24-2,Taub>话是没错 但要是想找到证据支持
<24-2,Taub>Yes,but if you want a diagnosis Backed by actual evidence,

465
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:42,410
<24-2,Taub>我们恐怕还得看看别的部位
<24-2,Taub>We should probably look at other cancers.

<24-13,House>只有癌细胞会被染色 很容易辨认出来
<24-13,House>Paint only works on the cancer cells,Makes 'em easier to spot.

483
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:30,780
<24-14,Foreman>单纯刺激胰腺都会造成凝血
<24-14,Foreman>Just agitating the pancreas can cause clotting,

<24-14,Foreman>你还想用这方法治疗abc已经有胰腺凝血病症的病人?
<24-14,Foreman>And you wanna do it to a guy whose problem is clotting.

485
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:35,250

<24-16,Thirteen>If we do shake something loose,we could kill him.

489
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:45,320
<24-17,Taub>或他局部"没命"
<24-17,Taub>Or one of him.

<27-5,Wilson>但若你动了真心 又不愿认真对待的话
<27-5,Wilson>But if you're serious and you don't treat it seriously,

519
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,040
<27-5,Wilson>你就会受伤的
<27-5,Wilson>Then you will get hurt.

520
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:38,190
<27-5,Wilson>你要是不肯承认这一点
<27-5,Wilson>And if you don't accept that,

521
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:40,900
<27-5,Wilson>那就承认她会因此受伤

<28-7,House>她看上去生气么?
<28-7,House>She look angry?

523

<28-8,Wilson>要是她抬头看到你在这的话...
<28-8,Wilson>If you're standing there when she looks up here--

524
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,910
<28-9,House>哦 大事不妙

00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:13,950
<29-1,Foreman>脉动80
<29-1,Foreman>Systolic's 80.

526
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:15,440
<29-2,Chase>得先把这缝合了才行
<29-2,Chase>Gotta finish this suture before I can get out.

<29-3,Foreman>给他注射多巴胺
<29-3,Foreman>Give him a dopamine drip.

528
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:18,620
<29-4,House>我们看的时机不对
<29-4,House>We weren't looking up at the right time.

<29-5,Foreman>赶紧说重点行不 我们正忙呢
<29-5,Foreman>Get to your point. We're a little busy here.

530
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,700
<29-6,House>不是癌症导致的凝血
<29-6,House>The clots aren't from cancer.

531
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:25,230
<29-6,House>- 心脏才是源头abc- 做过心脏超声波了 没有血块
<29-6,House>- They're coming from his heart. - We echoed the heart.No clots.

532
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:27,950
<29-7,Foreman>我们看的时候确实没有abc我开头说的不就是这意思么?
<29-7,Foreman>Not while we were looking. Didn't I open with that?

533
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:30,540
<29-8,House>- 是心律失常 才导致了凝血abc- 没有心律失常
<29-8,House>- The clots were caused by an arrhythmia. - No arrhythmia.

<29-10,House>间歇性心律失常
<29-10,House>Intermittent arrhythmia.

536
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,140
<29-10,House>这家伙一受点刺激就乱拔针管
<29-10,House>This guy pulls our equipment off at the slightest provocation.

537
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:39,290
<29-10,House>要看到心律失常 就得一直盯着他
<29-10,House>We'd have to be watching at the exact moment it happened,

538
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:44,220
<29-10,House>要我说 你俩就甭瞎捣鼓了 就现在吧!
<29-10,House>Which i'm guessing,Given the way you two are scrambling around like idiots,Is right now!

539
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:47,220
<29-10,House>没错 做个经食管超声心动图
<29-10,House>Yes,i'm saying do a transesophageal echo.

540
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:51,560
<29-11,Foreman>- 得赶紧让他心率恢复正常abc- 是啊 做完心动图再说吧!
<29-11,Foreman>- We have to get his bp stable. - Absolutely.Right after the echo.

<29-14,House>上回超声波的时候 他心脏还倍儿棒呢
<29-14,House>The heart looked healthy at the last echo.

543
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:59,970
<29-14,House>心律失常也不会导致正常心室出现凝血
<29-14,House>And an arrhythmia wouldn't cause clots in a healthy ventricle.

544
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:02,820
<29-14,House>从左心耳查起吧
<29-14,House>So start with the left atrial appendage.

545
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:09,640
<29-15,Chase>- 喔abc- 没错
<29-15,Chase>- Wow. - Yep.

547
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:14,990
<29-16,House>控制住这可怜虫的血压 把左心耳封住
<29-16,House>Now get this poor guy's bp under control And seal off the appendage.

548
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:16,450
<29-16,House>现在要做的
<29-16,House>Then all we have to do

549
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,820
<29-16,House>就是找出破坏心脏的元凶abc免得它找到自己真正的破坏目标
<29-16,House>Is find out what damaged his heart Before it goes after something he really needs.

<31-3,Scott>It wasn't me.

<31-4,Annie>我知道 如果你能控制自己abc你绝对不会这么做的 但是...
<31-4,Annie>I know you would never have done that If you were in control of yourself,but...

<31-5,Scott>- 但你回来了abc- 是来和你的医生谈谈
<31-5,Scott>- But you came back. - To talk with your doctors.

562
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:16,450
<31-6,Annie>我不断反思发生的这一切
<31-6,Annie>I've been going over and over what happened,And

563
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:18,600
<31-6,Annie>不知怎么我突然有了这么一个想法
<31-6,Annie>i had this thought out of nowhere.

564
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:21,320
<31-6,Annie>自从我认识Scott之后abc我就看到他的左手乱摔东西
<31-6,Annie>Ever since i've known scott,i've seen his left hand throw things

565
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:24,850
<31-6,Annie>但总像是开玩笑般的 觉得这很好玩
<31-6,Annie>But always sort of playfully,thinking it's fun.

566
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:27,660
<31-6,Annie>但当他扔这个时...
<31-6,Annie>But when he threw this...

567
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,260
<31-6,Annie>是出于愤怒
<31-6,Annie>It was angry,

568
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:33,770
<31-6,Annie>当我把这递给他 他扇我的时候也是
