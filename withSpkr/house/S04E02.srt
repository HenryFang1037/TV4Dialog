00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,540
<18-4,10>你不该这么肯定

401
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:43,450
<18-5,HOUSE>我进来后 那个小妞一直在对你指指点点
<18-5,HOUSE>And that chick's been pointing at you since I walked in.

<18-5,HOUSE>第二件事

<18-6,37>Slight glucose elevation--

405
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,160

<18-6,37>that says thyroid.

406

<18-9,39>Her thyroid's working.

<18-11,6>- 她的PDA里面有病人信息/- 我才没有
<18-11,6>- She has patient data on her pda./- I do not.

<18-12,24>我看到化验数据了
<18-12,24>I saw the lab values.

413

<18-13,6>你叫我们别写东西
<18-13,6>You said we couldn't write anything down.

00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,180
<18-14,HOUSE>我还说过 我要答案

418
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:13,650
<18-16,HOUSE>这就说到了第三个问题
<18-16,HOUSE>Which brings us to issue three.

419
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:15,450
<18-17,6>你是说 我们能写东西咯?
<18-17,6>You're saying we can write stuff down?

<18-18,HOUSE>对你 我说你被炒了
<18-18,HOUSE>To you,I'm saying you're fired.

421

<18-18,HOUSE>对其他人呢 我意思是--
<18-18,HOUSE>To everyone else,I'm saying--

422
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:19,300
<18-19,6>但你特别提到--
<18-19,6>but you said specifically--

423
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:20,600
<18-20,HOUSE>我讨厌告密者
<18-20,HOUSE>I hate tattletales.

00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:21,750
<18-21,6>她揭发了10号
<18-21,6>She tattled on 10.

00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,110
<18-22,HOUSE>你又告密咯
<18-22,HOUSE>Now you tattled twice.

426
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,910
<18-22,HOUSE>第三件事-- 快点 走人吧
<18-22,HOUSE>Issue three-- come on,let's go.

427
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:29,610
<18-22,HOUSE>第三件事
<18-22,HOUSE>Issue three.

428
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:32,120
<18-22,HOUSE>如果不能做测试/怎样才能完成测试呢?
<18-22,HOUSE>How do we do tests when we can't do tests?

429
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:34,070
<18-23,2>Cuddy医生没说不能做测试
<18-23,2>Dr.Cuddy didn't say we can't do tests.

430
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,450
<18-23,2>她只说我们得记录到病历
<18-23,2>She said we have to chart.

431
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,320
<18-24,HOUSE>如果要记录 肯定得不到病人同意
<18-24,HOUSE>If we chart,we won't get consent.

432
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:38,240
<18-24,HOUSE>因此不能
<18-24,HOUSE>So we can't.

433
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,270
<18-25,2>病人同不同意可能影响她的性命
<18-25,2>The patient's life may depend on her consenting.

434
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,700
<18-26,HOUSE>她只有不同意 才能继续飞行员的梦想
<18-26,HOUSE>Her dreams depend on her not consenting.

435
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,370
<18-26,HOUSE>所以 没法做测试时 怎么做测试呢?
<18-26,HOUSE>So how do we do tests when we can't do tests?

436
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,560
<18-26,HOUSE>你们有一个小时去想
<18-26,HOUSE>You've got an hour.

<19-1,HOUSE>不用扫描 怎么扫描肝脏呢?
<19-1,HOUSE>How do you scan a liver without scanning a liver?

438
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:00,370
<19-1,HOUSE>还有 Cameron在这干嘛?

439
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:03,220
<19-1,HOUSE>有意思
<19-1,HOUSE>Interesting.

440
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:04,990
<19-2,WILSON>现在 你"看见"Cameron了
<19-2,WILSON>So you're seeing cameron now.

441
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,060
<19-3,HOUSE>不 没意思/我不是"看见" 而是"看到了"
<19-3,HOUSE>No,not "interesting," because not "seeing." "saw."

442
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:13,880
<19-3,HOUSE>我病人不会同意做核磁共振和超声波的
<19-3,HOUSE>my patient won't consent to mris or ultrasounds.

443
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:16,240
<19-3,HOUSE>这里 你对付肝癌最有经验
<19-3,HOUSE>And you've dealt with more liver cancer than anyone else here.

444
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:20,350
<19-4,WILSON>你想我和你分享/我在尼泊尔学到的秘密扫描术?
<19-4,WILSON>So you want me to share the secret scanning techniques I learned in nepal?

445

<19-5,HOUSE>大厅
<19-5,HOUSE>In the lobby.

<19-5,HOUSE>Guess we could palpate the area around the liver.

449
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:31,900
<19-6,WILSON>除非肿瘤很大 否则是没用的/这点你清楚的
<19-6,WILSON>Which won't work unless the tumor's enormous,which you know.

450
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:35,010
<19-6,WILSON>这说明/你来这是因为那些幻觉把你吓坏了
<19-6,WILSON>Which means you're here because these visions are freaking you out.

451
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:37,990
<19-7,HOUSE>她是一头金发
<19-7,HOUSE>She had blonde hair.

455
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:48,130
<19-8,WILSON>我们得找找原因 否则你下次看到她/她就成黑人了
<19-8,WILSON>We should find out before the next time you see her when she'll be black.

<19-9,HOUSE>嗯 科学地讲 一个人回到/工作过的地方是不可能的咯?
<19-9,HOUSE>Mm-hmm,of course,it's scientifically impossible for a/person to go back and visit somewhere they worked.

<19-9,HOUSE>也不是
<19-9,HOUSE>No.

458
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:55,920
<19-10,WILSON>但她既然不是只死猫/(出自物理假设 薛定谔的猫)
<19-10,WILSON>But since she's not a dead cat,

459
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:59,120
<19-10,WILSON>科学地讲 她同时现身两处是不可能的
<19-10,WILSON>it is scientifically impossible for/her to be in two places at once.

00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,980
<19-12,WILSON>他们订婚了
<19-12,WILSON>Although they're engaged.

469
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:17,390
<19-12,WILSON>如果你和他们保持联络/你也许要送他们
<19-12,WILSON>And if you're staying in touch,you might want to buy them.

470
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,130
<19-12,WILSON>也许不是压抑的内疚感发作
<19-12,WILSON>Maybe it's not repressed guilt.

471
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,630
<19-12,WILSON>可能 你只是恐慌而已
<19-12,WILSON>Maybe it's just panic.

472

<19-12,WILSON>现在 你手下人多得都能造铁路了
<19-12,WILSON>Right now you've got enough fellows to build a railroad.

473
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:32,880
<19-12,WILSON>但你得把那满屋子的号码/消减到三人
<19-12,WILSON>But you're gonna have to narrow that room full of numbers down to three people.

474
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:36,710
<19-13,HOUSE>你能把你的机智推断/应用到我病人的肝上吗?
<19-13,HOUSE>Any chance you could turn this creative brilliance towards my patient's liver?

475
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:41,720
<19-14,WILSON>我觉得你用人 和他们的技术无关
<19-14,WILSON>I think you're gonna choose people for reasons that have nothing to do with their skills.

476
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:45,210
<19-14,WILSON>你选中的人 只因为你受不了他们
<19-14,WILSON>I think you're going to choose people just because you can't stand them.

477
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:49,130
<19-14,WILSON>因为你一旦喜欢上他们 那就...
<19-14,WILSON>Because if you like them,well,that's just.

<20-2,15B>You mean make her sick?

483
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,810
<20-3,HOUSE>我是说 让她身体有特定的故障
<20-3,HOUSE>I mean make her sick in a specific way.

484
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:09,880
<20-3,HOUSE>如果她的肝脏会失灵/那就制造故障看看
<20-3,HOUSE>If her liver's given to malfunctioning,we make it malfunction.

485
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,120
<20-4,15B>我们可以这么做吗?
<20-4,15B>Are we on the other side of wrong here?

486
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:14,560
<20-4,15B>难道不应该先咨询下道德准则理事会吗?
<20-4,15B>Don't we have an ethics board that we should consult?

487
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:16,450
<20-5,HOUSE>我不是炒了你嘛

<20-8,15B>Lying and paperwork,I get.Shutting down organs--

496
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:33,950
<20-9,13>可以给她静脉注射维生素D/然后把她绑在沙滩椅上晒太阳
<20-9,13>we could give her intravenous vitamin d and stick her in a tanning booth.

497
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,370
<20-9,13>如果她昏迷了/就知道是新陈代谢的问题
<20-9,13>If she goes into a coma,we know it's a metabolic problem.

498
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:38,790
<20-9,13>不错
<20-9,13>Nice.

499
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,200
<20-10,HOUSE>但是维生素D通过肝脏和肾来代谢
<20-10,HOUSE>But vitamin d's metabolized by the liver and kidneys.

<20-10,HOUSE>不能告诉我们 哪个器官坏了
<20-10,HOUSE>It wouldn't tell us which one's screwed up.

<20-10,HOUSE>给她喝龙舌兰酒 看她多久才醉晕
<20-10,HOUSE>Give her shots of tequila.Measure how long it takes for her to pass out.

503
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,860
<20-11,HOUSE>如果太快/就知道她的肝脏没在代谢酒精
<20-11,HOUSE>If it's too fast,then we know her liver's not processing alcohol.

504
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:54,200
<20-11,HOUSE>值得一试
<20-11,HOUSE>It's a shot.

00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:30,140
<22-14,18>这样 又有什么乐趣可言?
<22-14,18>Where's the fun in that?

556

<22-14,18>一个有限的 毫不神秘的世界--

557
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:33,450
<22-15,HOUSE>这和乐趣无关
<22-15,HOUSE>it's not about fun.

558
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:35,020
<22-15,HOUSE>而和事实有关
<22-15,HOUSE>It's about the truth.

559
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:38,870
<22-16,18>事实是 我们吵起来了/是因为你想研究我这人
<22-16,18>The truth is,we're having this debate because you want to figure something out about me.

560
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:40,920
<22-16,18>目前为止 你有什么结论?
<22-16,18>What do you got so far?

561
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:45,230
<22-16,18>Greta Greta
<22-16,18>Greta.Greta.

562
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,010
<22-18,18>她喘不过气了 我们得插管
<22-18,18>She can't breathe.We need to intubate.

563
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:49,500
<22-20,18>起码得供氧
<22-20,18>At least oxygen.

564

<22-21,GRETA >NASA会刨根问底的
<22-21,GRETA >Nasa will need to know why.

00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,010
<23-1,CUDDY>我查看了你要求进行的测试
<23-1,CUDDY>I checked the tests you ordered.

<23-2,HOUSE>你刚刚看见了Foreman了吗?
<23-2,HOUSE>Did you just see foreman?

567
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:09,270
<23-3,CUDDY>你测量了她的牙齿密度
<23-3,CUDDY>You measured the density of her teeth.

568
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:12,110
<23-4,HOUSE>这是检测高钙血症的捷径
<23-4,HOUSE>It's a shortcut test for hypercalcemia.

569
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,600
<23-4,HOUSE>你刚才肯定和他擦身而过了
<23-4,HOUSE>You had to have just passed him.

570
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:17,660
<23-5,CUDDY>你在病患毫无骨折迹象的情况下/怀疑她得了高钙血症?
<23-5,CUDDY>So you suspected hypercalcemia from her complete lack of broken bones.

571
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:19,980
<23-5,CUDDY>你还为此做了三次毒理检查吗?
<23-5,CUDDY>Is that why you also ran three tox screens.

572
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,290
<23-6,HOUSE>病患可能偷吃兴奋剂
<23-6,HOUSE>Patient might've been sneaking uppers.

573
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:24,340
<23-6,HOUSE>他穿着白大褂 你重新雇用他了?
<23-6,HOUSE>He was in a white coat.Did you hire him back?

574
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:27,300
<23-7,CUDDY>Foreman现在纽约Mercy医院/负责诊断科
<23-7,CUDDY>Foreman is running the diagnostic department at new york mercy.

575
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:36,540
<23-7,CUDDY>你喝酒了?
<23-7,CUDDY>Have you been drinking?

576
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:58,920
<24-1,18>病患呼吸困难
<24-1,18>She was having trouble breathing.

<24-1,18>拒绝输氧和插管
<24-1,18>Refused oxygen and intubation.

578
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,140
<24-2,HOUSE>所以你们就把她弄到跑步机上?
<24-2,HOUSE>So you put her on a treadmill.

579
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:07,690
<24-3,13>这样报告上就会注明/是在常规心脏负荷测试中给她吸氧
<24-3,13>Records will show that we gave her oxygen as a part of a routine cardio stress test.

580
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:10,010
<24-3,13>病患呼吸得以恢复正常
<24-3,13>She gets to breathe.

581
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,730
<24-3,13>给上司的报告也无懈可击
<24-3,13>Your boss gets her paperwork.

582
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:13,510
<24-4,HOUSE>这是谁的主意?
<24-4,HOUSE>Who's idea was that?

583
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,440
<24-5,13>这是通力合作的成果
<24-5,13>It was a joint decision.

584
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:18,560
<24-6,HOUSE>才怪
<24-6,HOUSE>It never is.

<24-8,HOUSE>- Why do you think-/- why aren't you answering?

587
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:28,480
<24-8,HOUSE>离婚是你妈妈提出来的?
<24-8,HOUSE>Did your mother initiate the divorce?

588
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:30,830
<24-9,13>该关注的是她的肺部到底出了什么问题
<24-9,13>We should probably focus on what's wrong with her lungs.

589
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:31,860
<24-10,HOUSE>你是女巫吗?
<24-10,HOUSE>Are you a wiccan?

<25-2,18>The problem's not the surgery.

617
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,150
<25-2,18>问题出在疤痕上
<25-2,18>It's the scars.

618
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,560
<25-2,18>有整形医师可以除去疤痕
<25-2,18>And we have a plastic surgeon here who can hide 'em.

<25-3,39>我说干脆在她的氧气里加点乙醚/然后该干嘛干嘛
<25-3,39>I say we just put ether in her oxygen and do what we have to do.

622
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,700
<25-4,2>她会起诉的
<25-4,2>She'll sue.

<25-6,39>呃 倒不必隐藏疤痕
<25-6,39>Uh,we don't need to hide them.

<25-6,39>对她进行选择性整容外科手术
<25-6,39>We give her elective cosmetic surgery.

627
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:21,170
<25-6,39>通过切口 可以对其肺部进行手术/而她也可为疤痕提供合理的解释
<25-6,39>The incisions will give us access to her lungs and she's got an innocent explanation for the scars.

628
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:22,980
<25-7,2>你是指 吸脂术?
<25-7,2>You mean like liposuction.

629
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:24,030
<25-8,39>不
<25-8,39>No,no.

630
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,090
<25-8,39>那样的切口离肺部太远
<25-8,39>Uh,those incisions are too far from the lungs.

631
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:29,300
<25-8,39>我们不抽除物质 而是添加
<25-8,39>We don't subtract,we add.

<26-2,39>Just sign the form.

639
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:53,250
<26-3,GRETA>这会让我颜面尽失
<26-3,GRETA>This'll make me a joke.

640
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:55,230
<26-3,GRETA>肯定还有其他办法
<26-3,GRETA>There's got to be another way.

641
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:02,120
<26-4,39>我 认识不少心怀大志的人
<26-4,39>I've,uh,known a few people who had dreams.

642
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:09,800
<26-4,39>他们的共同之处在于/就算被人嘲笑也会不以为意
<26-4,39>One thing they all had in common was they got laughed at and they didn't care.

643
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:23,080
<27-1,CUDDY>你为了隆胸手术取消了一个脾切除手术?
<27-1,CUDDY>You bumped a splenectomy for a boob job?

644
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:27,180
<27-2,HOUSE>和她说话时 人人只看她的脸不看她的胸/你忍心让这女人一辈子都这么痛苦吗?
<27-2,HOUSE>Would you condemn this woman to a life where people look at her face when they talk to her?

645
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,840
<27-3,CUDDY>你不解释清楚 我就取消手术
<27-3,CUDDY>You don't explain this,I'll cancel the surgery.

646
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:31,560
<27-4,HOUSE>我能解析下为什么你来这吗?
<27-4,HOUSE>Can I explain why you're here?

647
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:33,840
<27-5,CUDDY>我刚刚说过了为什么我--
<27-5,CUDDY>Think I just told you why I--

648
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:38,510
<27-6,HOUSE>我要给诊断病患做隆胸手术/这实在是匪夷所思
<27-6,HOUSE>I scheduled a diagnostic patient for a boob job,which is ridiculous.

649
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,340
<27-6,HOUSE>因此很显然你得来质问我
<27-6,HOUSE>So obviously you had to confront me.

650
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:41,550
<27-7,CUDDY>到目前为止 说的没错
<27-7,CUDDY>With you so far.

651
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,890
<27-8,HOUSE>不过我会给你个理由

652
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:43,990
<27-9,CUDDY>理由不充分
<27-9,CUDDY>Not a good one.

653
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,950
<27-9,CUDDY>是不充分
<27-9,CUDDY>No.

654
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,590
<27-9,CUDDY>连充分的边都沾不上
<27-9,CUDDY>Not even close to a good one.

655
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:49,780
<27-10,HOUSE>但这理由会动摇你的观点
<27-10,HOUSE>But here's the drag from your point of view.

656
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:52,110
<27-10,HOUSE>因为我的解释是会有道理的
<27-10,HOUSE>My explanation will make sense.

657
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,380
<27-10,HOUSE>董事会不理解
<27-10,HOUSE>Not to the board.

<27-10,HOUSE>But to you.

660
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:57,170
<27-10,HOUSE>所以你会支持我
<27-10,HOUSE>So you'll let me do it.

661
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:01,400
<27-10,HOUSE>然后在行政听证会上 你会坐在我身边
<27-10,HOUSE>Then you're gonna have to sit next to me at the administrative hearing.

662
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,800
<27-10,HOUSE>你没有更要紧的事要做吗?
<27-10,HOUSE>Don't you have better things to do?

663
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:16,820
<27-10,HOUSE>完全是为了病患的利益
<27-10,HOUSE>It's in the best interests of the patient.
