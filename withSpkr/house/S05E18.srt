64
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:53,620
<4-6,House>意味着癫痫是真的 那么她的病因是苯酚
<4-6,House>Which means this was real. Whichabcmeans her problem is phenol.

65
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,380
<4-7,Taub>苯酚吗
<4-7,Taub>Carbolic acid?

66

<4-9,Taub>她得一天喝完5瓶苯酚才会这样
<4-9,Taub>She'd have to drink five bottles a day.

71
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,520
<4-10,House>所以我才觉得你们搜屋时abc会轻而易举找到证据
<4-10,House>Which is why I'm sure you won't have troubleabcdiscovering evidence of it when you search her house.

72
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:15,930

<4-11,Kutner>That does make more sense.

77
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,780
<4-11,Kutner>为什么你要戏弄Taub?
<4-11,Kutner>So why are you wasting taub's time?

78

<10-8,Foreman>可能这只猫也有这本领
<10-8,Foreman>It is possibleabcthere's something in this cat.

172
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,140
<10-9,House>更有可能的是 这一切只是巧合
<10-9,House>It's more possible thatabcit was just a coincidence.

<10-10,Thirteen>Is that a coincidence too?

177
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:41,630
<10-11,Foreman>也许这只猫并不能预测死亡
<10-11,Foreman>Maybe the cat didn't predict a thing.

178
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,300
<10-11,Foreman>而是带来了死亡
<10-11,Foreman>Might have caused the deaths.

191
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:21,980
<10-20,House>根据他忘记退出的网上投资账户abc也能得出这结论 但主要还是根据松饼
<10-20,House>I'm also extrapolating from the online portfolioabcyou forgot to log off,but it's mostly the muffins.

192
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,580

<12-4,Kutner>Why are you pushing a crash cart?

209
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:32,420
<12-5,House>因为有时病人需要急救
<12-5,House>Because patients sometimes crash.

210
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:37,220
<12-5,House>而且他们还没发明急救拖拉机abc好让我在走道里疯狂飙车
<12-5,House>And they haven't yet invented a crash tractorabcfor me to drive wildly around the hallways.

211
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,790
<13-1,Kutner>我们来昏迷病人的病房干什么?
<13-1,Kutner>Why are we in the coma patients' room?

<13-3,House>Then I willabchave scientifically disproved--

215

<13-4,Kutner>你并非为了病人才留下这只猫abc而是为了这只猫才留下了病人
<13-4,Kutner>You didn't keep this patient despite theabccat. You kept this patient because of the cat.

228
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:31,330
<13-12,Taub>或者House搞砸了

229
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:34,610
<13-12,Taub>如果你把嘈杂的呼吸音听成了微弱的
<13-12,Taub>If you misinterpreted the breathabcsounds as soft instead of loud,

230

<13-13,Foreman>我也听了她的肺音 你是说我也搞砸了?
<13-13,Foreman>I also heard the lung soundsabctoo,taub. You saying I screwed up?

<13-14,Taub>"Screwed up"is maybe too harsh,but yes.

234
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,930

<14-6,House>有老鼠恰恰证明我没有猫
<14-6,House>Well,now you see the mice actuallyabcprove that I don't have a cat.

252
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:13,760
<14-7,Cuddy>这是...肿瘤科的转基因实验老鼠吗?
<14-7,Cuddy>Are these-- are these theabcgenetically modified lab mice from oncology?

253
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,170
<14-8,House>转基因的味道更好

<14-14,House>我们把她撵到大街上abc这种情况可能再发生
<14-14,House>We kick her onto theabcstreet,it could happen again.

268
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:18,810
<15-3,House>也就是说 你并非一直是个迷信的蠢蛋
<15-3,House>So you weren't always aabcsuperstitious idiot.

269
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:23,330
<15-4,Morgan>- 我不是迷信--abc- 那四年前是怎么回事?
<15-4,Morgan>- I'm not a super-- - How 'boutabcfour years,that sound right?

270
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:27,140
<15-5,House>从那时起 你不再信赖家庭保险计划abc而转投现在的信仰
<15-5,House>That's when you switched from a familyabcinsurance plan to the one you're on now.

271
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,390
<15-6,Morgan>我结婚了 后来又离了
<15-6,Morgan>I was married. I got divorced.

272
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:33,980
<15-7,House>在这之前两年 你注射过水痘疫苗

273
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:37,120
<15-7,House>成人只有在有小孩子时abc才会注射这种疫苗
<15-7,House>which you only get inabcadulthood when you have a kid.

274
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:42,040
<15-7,House>或者说 你曾经有过小孩abc但从来没有孩子来探望你
<15-7,House>Or I should say when you had a kidabcbecause no kid has come to visit you.

275
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:45,320
<15-7,House>我由此联想到abc曾经发生过不幸的事
<15-7,House>Which all makes meabcthink something bad happened.

276
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,780
<15-8,Morgan>是我的继子 Timothy
<15-8,Morgan>It was my step son,timothy.

277
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,360
<15-9,House>怎么回事?
<15-9,House>What happened?

278
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:59,380
<15-10,Morgan>他当时在学校里
<15-10,Morgan>He was in school.

<15-10,Morgan>He was having his morningabcsnack. And he choked.

280
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:08,400
<15-10,Morgan>老师用尽一切办法 也没能把他救回来
<15-10,Morgan>And the teacher saw it,and they didabceverything that they were supposed to.

281
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:11,240
<15-10,Morgan>他不应该这么死去
<15-10,Morgan>He shouldn't have died.

282
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,280
<15-11,House>你想为这一切寻求解释
<15-11,House>You want to make it make sense.

283
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:19,720
<15-12,Morgan>难道不该寻找么?
<15-12,Morgan>What's wrong with that?

284
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:22,800
<15-12,Morgan>这是徒劳无功的 就错在这儿
<15-12,Morgan>It's meaningless,is what's wrong.

285
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:26,180
<15-13,House>既不能救回你孩子的性命
<15-13,House>What's wrong is that it doesn'tabcdo a thing to bring your kid back

286
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:29,030
<15-13,House>也不能让你和前夫破镜重圆
<15-13,House>or put you and your ex together again.

287
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:36,890
<15-13,House>你脖子上出现了皮疹
<15-13,House>Rash on your neck.

288
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:40,330
<15-13,House>也许对Cuddy来说还不够
<15-13,House>Probably not enough for cuddy.

289
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,080
<15-14,Morgan>- 我无法呼吸abc- 嘿 医生
<15-14,Morgan>- I can't breathe.abc- Hey,doc.

<16-2,Taub>You're still punishing me for callingabcyou out on the green urine lady?

296

<16-3,House>不 是惩罚你向Cuddy揭发我
<16-3,House>Nope,this is for ratting me out to cuddy.

<16-3,House>我又没逼你道歉 只是让你abc把盒子里的便便铲出去罢了
<16-3,House>I'm not asking you to apologize,justabcscoop some poop out of a box.

<16-6,Foreman>He won't just continue toabclet our room smell like cat pee.

<16-10,Kutner>现在换惩罚我了? 因为你觉得我迷信abc这跟你有什么关系?
<16-10,Kutner>Now you're punishing me because youabcthink I'm superstitious? What do you care?

305
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:56,240
<16-11,House>这跟我没啥关系
<16-11,House>It's not so much about me caring per se.

<16-11,House>我只是好奇你咋会这么笨abc别人说什么都信
<16-11,House>It's more about me wondering whyabcyou're such a credulous idiot.

351
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:53,710
<19-12,Foreman>既然我们排除了所有可能病因abc会不会只是表面看来是褐色的?
<19-12,Foreman>If we've ruled out everything that can make theabcurine brown,what if it just looked brown?

352

<23-5,Kutner>Maybe it has something to do with thatabclittle red dot dancing around down there.

429
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:09,980
<23-6,House>噢我的天 死之激光正在照射你的腿abc你就要死了
<23-6,House>Oh,my god,the death laser isabcattacking your legs. You're gonna die.

430
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:12,000
<23-7,Thirteen>我们在浪费时间
<23-7,Thirteen>We're wasting time looking for cancer.

431
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:14,750
<23-7,Thirteen>她还能走 算是很健康
<23-7,Thirteen>She's still walking around.abcShe's still pretty healthy.

432
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,340
<23-7,Thirteen>或许她得的不是什么大病
<23-7,Thirteen>Maybe it's something minor.

433
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,870
<23-8,Kutner>或许不是在浪费时间
<23-8,Kutner>Maybe we're not wasting time.

434
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,490
<23-8,Kutner>我们不该发现平坦性病变
<23-8,Kutner>We wouldn't have seen a flat lesion.

435
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:26,490
<23-9,House>皮肤癌能转移到肠 酷
<23-9,House>Skin cancer could have metastasizedabcto the intestines. Cool.

436
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:29,710
<23-9,House>查黑素瘤
<23-9,House>Check for melanomas.

437
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:52,070

<24-1,House>什么事?
<24-1,House>What?

439
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,220
<24-2,Kutner>不是癌症 我们在她背上发现了蜘蛛脉
<24-2,Kutner>It's not cancer. We foundabcspider veins on her back.

440
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:12,720
<24-2,Kutner>她刚来的时候没有
<24-2,Kutner>They weren't there when she came in.

441
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:18,360
<24-3,House>蜘蛛脉意味着库欣氏症(皮质醇增多)abc可导致胃肠紊乱 褐色尿--
<24-3,House>Spider veins means cushing's.Could cause anabcabdominal disturbance,brown urine--

442
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:20,830
<24-4,Kutner>支气管痉挛呢?
<24-4,Kutner>But the bronchospasm?

443
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:26,250
<24-4,Kutner>库欣氏肌病 不常见 但--
<24-4,Kutner>Cushing's myopathy.It'sabcuncommon but--

444
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:29,530
<24-5,House>等等
<24-5,House>wait a second.

445
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:32,890
<24-5,House>你不会因为个非致死症状而吵醒我
<24-5,House>You didn't wake me up to tell meabca symptom that's not killing her.

446
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,880
<24-5,House>还有什么?
<24-5,House>What else is going on?

447
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:36,610
<24-6,Kutner>我想她要死了
<24-6,Kutner>I think she's dying.

448
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:38,340
<24-7,House>我说了是库欣氏
<24-7,House>I just told you it's cushing'S.

449
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:42,430
<24-8,Kutner>我不是说由于蜘蛛脉abcLimpert先生死了
<24-8,Kutner>I don't mean because of theabcspider veins. Mr. Limpert died.

450
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:45,790
<24-9,House>- 如果他是我高中健身教练--abc- 是那个昏迷的病人
<24-9,House>- If that's my high school gymabcteacher-- - It's your coma patient.

451
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:49,070
<24-10,Kutner>他这一年半来都很稳定 突然就死了
<24-10,Kutner>He was stable for a yearabcand a half,and he just died.

452
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,830
<24-10,Kutner>猫是对的 House
<24-10,Kutner>The cat was right,house.

<25-1,House>出来啊 小猫猫猫猫猫
<25-1,House>Here,puss,puss,puss,pusspuss.

454
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:01,000
<25-2,Foreman>再说一声"猫"  连说6声 她就会现身
<25-2,Foreman>Say "puss" one more time. It's theabcsixth "puss" that really does it.

455
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:04,190
<25-3,House>说得好 生闷气就能解决问题
<25-3,House>You're right. Sulkingabcwill solve everything.

456
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:07,450
<25-3,House>那猫蜷在我腿上 它肯定知道什么
<25-3,House>That cat sat on my lap,andabcthat cat knows something.

457
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,430
<25-4,Kutner>你现在信了?
<25-4,Kutner>You believe it now?

458
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,970
<25-5,Thirteen>昨天那是巧合
<25-5,Thirteen>Yesterday it was all a coincidence.

459
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:13,450
<25-6,House>我想无意中证明它不是
<25-6,House>Yesterday it was until Iabcunintentionally proved it wasn'T.

460
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,010
<25-7,Foreman>她患的库欣氏综合症
<25-7,Foreman>Patient must have cushing'S.

461
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:16,660
<25-7,Foreman>我们要找到--
<25-7,Foreman>We have to figureabcout whether it's--

462
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:19,720
<25-8,Kutner>猫的嗅觉很灵 能闻出肝或肾衰竭
<25-8,Kutner>Cat's nose is powerful. It couldabcsmell liver or kidney failure.

463
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:24,040
<25-9,House>正确 可要是你上午稍加留意abc传真过来的老人院档案文件
<25-9,House>Exactly,except if you'd glanced at the nursingabchome files I had faxed over this morning,

464
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:27,190
<25-9,House>你就知道大部分病人的肝和肾都没问题abc接着?
<25-9,House>you'd know that most of the patients'abclivers and kidneys were fine;what else?

465
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:30,430
<25-10,Foreman>磁共振没显示库欣氏abc是在肾上腺还是在大脑发病
<25-10,Foreman>Mris aren't telling us if theabccushing's in her adrenals or her brain.

466
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,780
<25-11,House>那就去查促肾上腺皮质激素
<25-11,House>So check her A.C.T.H.

467
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:35,070
<25-12,Kutner>- 猫的视觉在光谱的蓝色端abc- 激素水平11.7
<25-12,Kutner>- A cat's vision is at the blue end of the spectrum.abc- A.C.T. H.Is 11.7.

468
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,220
<25-13,Foreman>无法分辨
<25-13,Foreman>It's too close to tell.

469
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:38,890
<25-13,Foreman>治疗错器官也无济于事
<25-13,Foreman>We can't treat the wrong organabc'cause that won't solveanything.

470
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,870
<25-13,Foreman>皮质醇剧烈增加 她会死的
<25-13,Foreman>She could have a cortisolabcstorm,could kill her.

471
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,600
<25-14,House>又或许 你作为资深员工abc应该确保我的门关紧了
<25-14,House>Well,maybe as the senior fellow you couldabchave made sure that my doors were closed,

472
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,400
<25-14,House>这样我就能集中精力思考abc而不是一直寻找她
<25-14,House>so that I could be concentrating onabcthe cat instead of looking for the cat.

473
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:53,210
<25-15,Kutner>你还好吧?
<25-15,Kutner>You all right?

474
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:56,720
<25-15,Kutner>你的鼻子
<25-15,Kutner>Your nose.

475
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:04,660
<25-16,Foreman>他说什么?
<25-16,Foreman>What'd he say?

476
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:09,330
<25-17,Kutner>好像是"喜欢酸梅汁吗?"
<25-17,Kutner>Sounds like he said,"doabcyou like cranberry juice?"

477
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:12,280
<25-18,House>- 去死abc- 比假血便宜
<25-18,House>- Crap.abc- Cheaper than fake blood.

478
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:14,530
<25-18,House>而且酸酸甜甜
<25-18,House>And more cran-tastic.

479
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,690
<25-18,House>别让门再那样敞开
<25-18,House>Don't ever leave myabcdoor open like that again.

480
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:19,560
<25-19,Foreman>你还有心情开玩笑 那女的快死了
<25-19,Foreman>You're playing pranks,andabcthis woman could be dying.

481
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:22,280
<25-20,House>让Chase做个大脑静脉取样
<25-20,House>So have chase do a venousabcsampling in her brain.

482
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,880
<25-20,House>找到了 就在大脑
<25-20,House>If he finds something,it's there.

483
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:27,030
<25-20,House>没找到 就在肾上腺
<25-20,House>If he finds nothing,it's the adrenals.

484
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:35,450
<26-1,Taub>我不是以前的我了 我害怕
<26-1,Taub>I'm not who I used to be. I'm scared.

485
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:38,730
<26-1,Taub>这不是生活
<26-1,Taub>That's not a way to live.

486
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:42,510
<26-1,Taub>我想在你那儿工作
<26-1,Taub>I want to come work for you.

487
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:49,230
<26-2,Neil>天啊 你不会以为--abc我没有暗示现在就能雇你
<26-2,Neil>Jeez,chris,you didn't think-- I didn't meanabcto imply that I could hire you right now.

488
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:51,390
<26-3,Taub>你说你需要我这样的人
<26-3,Taub>You said you needed guys like me.

489
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:55,120
<26-4,Neil>我知道 但你没有工商管理硕士学位
<26-4,Neil>I know,but you don't have an mba.

490
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,380
<26-4,Neil>而且我刚雇了个首席医疗官
<26-4,Neil>And I just hired a chief medical officer.

491
00:31:57,410 --> 00:32:01,660
<26-5,Taub>让我去搞那个激光刀手术abc我有点存款 虽然不是很多--
<26-5,Taub>Let me invest in that laser scalpelabcstart-up. I got money saved.Not a ton but--

492
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:05,140
<26-6,Neil>首轮融资最少需要两百万
<26-6,Neil>We put ina $2 million minimumabcfor the first round financing.

493
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:12,950
<26-6,Neil>我也许可以为你放宽条件
<26-6,Neil>Look,I guess I could take youabcon at a smaller number.

494
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:16,460
<26-6,Neil>但你要明白 不会很快就看到收益
<26-6,Neil>But you have to understand,itabcwouldn't be some quick payoff.

495
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,760
<26-7,Taub>我明白 这不会让我一夜暴富
<26-7,Taub>I know,I know it's not gonnaabcchange my life overnight.

496
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:23,650
<26-7,Taub>我只想改变
<26-7,Taub>I just need to start changing it.

497
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:28,210
<26-8,Neil>好 那就开始
<26-8,Neil>Okay,then let's start.

498
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:35,170
<27-1,Wilson>你到底想在这个昏迷男体内找到什么?
<27-1,Wilson>What exactly are you hoping toabcfind inside your dead coma guy?

499
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:39,700
<27-2,House>猫薄荷 狗骨头 不知道才找
<27-2,House>Catnip. Chew toy. I don'tabcow. Th's why I'm looking.

500
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:43,280
<27-3,Chase>病人在静脉取样时心脏停博
<27-3,Chase>Your patient had cardiac arrestabcduring the venous sampling.

501
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:45,860
<27-3,Chase>抢救了回来 但心脏依然很弱
<27-3,Chase>We got her back,but herabcheart's still tenuous.

502
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:48,410
<27-5,Foreman>- 这说明?abc- 她很虚弱 快死了
<27-5,Foreman>- That tell us anything?abc- She's weak,possibly dying.

503
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:50,150
<27-6,House>那就是没事
<27-6,House>So nothing.

504
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,490
<27-6,House>促肾上腺皮质激素呢?
<27-6,House>What about the A.C.T.H.?

505
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:52,890
<27-7,Chase>明显升高
<27-7,Chase>Slighy elevated.

506
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:55,320
<27-8,House>这说明库欣氏原发于脑--去吧
<27-8,House>That confirms theabccushing's is in the brain--go.

507
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:57,620
<27-9,Chase>你确定这是库欣氏?
<27-9,Chase>Are you surethat it's cushing's?

508
00:32:57,630 --> 00:33:00,080
<27-9,Chase>通常会使人肥胖 她身材很好
<27-9,Chase>You'd expect central bodyabcobesity. She's in good shape.

509
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:02,800
<27-10,House>如果是通常情况abc也不会有猫咪牵扯其中了
<27-10,House>If it had a normal presentation,thereabcwouldn't be a cat involved.

510
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:04,130
<27-11,Foreman>那就是脑
<27-11,Foreman>So it's the brain.

511
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:06,920
<27-11,Foreman>意味着下一步问题是移除脑垂体--
<27-11,Foreman>That means the next question is whetherabcto remove the pituitary right now--

512
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,150
<27-12,House>这不是我的问题
<27-12,House>That's not a question for me.

513
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,920
<27-12,House>是病人的问题
<27-12,House>That's a question for the patient.

514
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:13,270
<27-12,House>两方面都告诉她 让她选
<27-12,House>You'll present bothabcsides and let her decide.

515
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,260
<27-13,Chase>好吧
<27-13,Chase>All right.

516
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:19,840
<27-14,Wilson>我决定不告诉你我的理论了
<27-14,Wilson>I've gotta stop telling you my theories.

517
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:21,350
<27-14,Wilson>你总是想证明我错了
<27-14,Wilson>You always just try to prove me wrong.

518
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:25,030
<27-15,House>就是那个Cuddy的屁股abc会在满月时变大的理论?
<27-15,House>You mean the theory about cuddy'sabcass getting bigger at the full moon?

519
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,200
<27-15,House>我确定了 照片还在博客里
<27-15,House>I confirmed that one.abcPhoto's on my blog.

520
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:30,050
<27-16,Wilson>通常你会在病房恐吓病人听从你的指挥
<27-16,Wilson>Normally,you'd be up in the patientabcroom hectoring her on what to do.

521
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:32,750
<27-16,Wilson>而现在却在解剖不相干的
<27-16,Wilson>Instead you're up to your elbowsabcin some irrelevant dead guy

522
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,780
<27-16,Wilson>还不知道和魔法猫有没有关系的死尸
<27-16,Wilson>who may or may not beabcconnected to a magic cat

523
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:38,240
<27-16,Wilson>因为你想向我证明你不在乎
<27-16,Wilson>because you want to prove toabcme that you don't care.

524
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:42,050
<27-17,House>案子了结 我在探求科学的奥秘
<27-17,House>Case is over. I'm exploring aabcscientific mystery.

525
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:44,150
<27-18,Wilson>我能容忍你的探索精神
<27-18,Wilson>I put up with your obsessions.

526
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:48,040
<27-18,Wilson>甚至鼓励 只因为--它们能救命
<27-18,Wilson>I even encourage them,forabcone reason-- they save lives.

527
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:51,220
<27-18,Wilson>我不明白你现在在干什么
<27-18,Wilson>I don't know what you're doing now.

528
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:02,000
<28-1,Chase>库欣氏综合症是指abc身体产生了过多的叫皮质醇的激素
<28-1,Chase>Cushing's means your body'sabcoverproducing a hormone called cortisol.

529
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:05,420
<28-1,Chase>推荐疗法是药物抑制
<28-1,Chase>The recommended course of actionabcis to suppress it with drugs.

530
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,550
<28-2,Morgan>能治好吗?
<28-2,Morgan>And that will cure ?

531
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:10,870
<28-3,Chase>只是抑制 停药便反弹
<28-3,Chase>Just treat it. It could come back.

532
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:15,800
<28-3,Chase>要根治只能开颅移除脑垂体
<28-3,Chase>The only permanent solution is to cut intoabcyour brain and remove your pituitary gland,

533
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:18,070
<28-3,Chase>但很危险
<28-3,Chase>but the surgery's dangerous.

534

<28-3,Chase>你的心脏已经停搏过一次
<28-3,Chase>Your heart stopped onabcthe table once already.

535
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:24,440
<28-4,Morgan>我想做手术
<28-4,Morgan>I want the surgery.

536
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:28,230
<28-4,Morgan>如果我不先解决它 它就会结果我
<28-4,Morgan>This thing is gonna killabcme if I don't kill it first.

537
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,570
<28-5,Chase>因为猫吗?
<28-5,Chase>Because of the cat?

538
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:36,160
<28-6,Morgan>你是想说我有多傻吗?
<28-6,Morgan>Do you want to tellabcme what an idiot I'm being?

539
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:38,100
<28-6,Morgan>不
<28-6,Morgan>No.

540
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:42,750
<28-7,Chase>我坚信有科学不能解释的事
<28-7,Chase>I really believe that there areabcthings that science can't understand,

541
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:46,180
<28-7,Chase>才有了信仰和祈祷
<28-7,Chase>that there is a role forabcfaith and prayer,

542
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:50,710
<28-7,Chase>在候诊室里可以这么想abc在手术室里可不行
<28-7,Chase>but it's in the waitingabcroom,not the O.R.

543
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:57,570
<28-8,Morgan>我生病是有原因的
<28-8,Morgan>There's a reason I got sick.

544
00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:01,240
<28-8,Morgan>坏事发生在我身上也是有原因的
<28-8,Morgan>There's a reason for all the badabcthings that have happened to me.

545
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:06,200
<28-8,Morgan>我不知道是什么原因 但我知道abc如果没有原因
<28-8,Morgan>I don't knowwhat that reason is,butabcI know thatif there isn't one,

546
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:10,470
<28-8,Morgan>如果世人都没有目标
<28-8,Morgan>if there's noabcgreater purpose in the world,

547
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:13,920
<28-8,Morgan>那将不是我想存在的世界
<28-8,Morgan>then it's not a world I want to live in.

<28-9,Chase>我会安排手术的

<29-6,Taub>You're not accepting my resignation?

554
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:00,310
<29-7,House>这样省事点
<29-7,House>Easier this way.

555
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:05,510
<29-7,House>略过了你慌慌张张地跑回来求我abc我教训你一顿再给你复职的过程
<29-7,House>It voids the whole thing where you panic,run backabcand grovel,and I punish you and then te you back.

556
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,490

<31-6,Taub>This is crazy. I'mabcinvesting with his company.

00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:02,400
<31-7,Secretary>他压根没有公司
<31-7,Secretary>He doesn't have a company.

566
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:05,140
<31-7,Secretary>他在这工作的时候 是个接待员 做临时工
<31-7,Secretary>He worked here,but heabcwas a receptionist,a temp.

00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:06,970
<31-8,Taub>- 他现在在哪?abc- 被拘留了
<31-8,Taub>- Where is he?abc- He's in custody.

<31-9,Secretary>I really am not supposed toabcsay anything else.

569
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:11,360
<31-10,Taub>我跟他是高中校友啊
<31-10,Taub>I went to high school with him.

<31-11,Secretary>被他骗过的人都这么以为
<31-11,Secretary>That's what everyone else thought too.

571
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,990
<31-11,Secretary>我猜你也帮他治好了耳病吧?
<31-11,Secretary>I'm guessing youabcalso cured his ear problem.

572
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:22,180
<31-11,Secretary>- 你给他钱了么?abc- 还没有
<31-11,Secretary>- Did you give him the money yet?abc- No.

<31-11,Secretary>我是对的
<31-11,Secretary>I was right.

574
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:37,650
<32-1,House>更让人快活的是 你错啦
<32-1,House>And more satisfyingly,you were wrong.

575
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:39,310
<32-1,House>这的确是个巧合
<32-1,House>It was a coincidence.

576
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:42,100
<32-1,House>那猫不是预知死亡
<32-1,House>The cat was not predicting deaths.

577
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:43,610
<32-1,House>它只是想找块暖和的地儿窝着
<32-1,House>It was just trying to keep warm.

578
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:46,350
<32-2,Wilson>是啊 再没有比死人的身体abc更能发光发热的东西了
<32-2,Wilson>Yes,dead people areabcrenowned for their warm glow.

579
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:50,410
<32-3,House>确实 其中有三个病人发烧了
<32-3,House>They are if they're feverish,likeabcthree of the patients were.

580
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:53,800
<32-3,House>不然就像另八个那样 日渐衰弱
<32-3,House>Or if they're wastingabcaway,like the other eight.

581
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:55,530
<32-4,Wilson>- 消瘦并不能...abc- 绝对能
<32-4,Wilson>- Wasting doesn't--abc- Yeah,it does.

582
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:58,710
<32-5,House>因为有人会为你盖电热毯
<32-5,House>If it means someone sticks aabcheating blanket on you.

583
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:05,570
<32-6,Wilson>恭喜 多亏你没完没了纠缠这只猫abc才解开了这毫无意义的谜团
<32-6,Wilson>Congrats. Because of your crazy obsession withabcthis cat,you've solved a completely trivial mystery.

584
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:09,110
<32-6,Wilson>毫无意义 上帝啊
<32-6,Wilson>*****My god.

585
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:12,350
<32-7,House>这明显只是较无意义
<32-7,House>It's clearly only partially trivial.

586
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:15,690
<32-7,House>Debbie也爬到Morgan身上了abc说明她也发烧了
<32-7,House>Debbie climbed on morganabctoo,which means she was overheated.

587
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:21,400
<32-7,House>究竟什么会导致面红 以及abc除中心体肥大之外的类库欣氏症候群呢?
<32-7,House>So what causes flushing and mimics everyabccushing's symptom except central body obesity?

588
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:24,480
<32-7,House>癌症
<32-7,House>Cancer.

589
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:27,890
<32-8,Wilson>肠道类癌瘤会刺激促肾上腺皮质激素分泌
<32-8,Wilson>A corticotropin-producing carcinoidabctumor of the intestine.

590
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:30,680
<32-8,Wilson>但用胶囊摄像机什么都没看见啊
<32-8,Wilson>But your pillcam didn't find anything.

591
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:34,080
<32-9,House>说明肿瘤肯定在abc胶囊摄像机到不了的地方
<32-9,House>Means it must be somewhere theabcpillm couldn't go.

592
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:36,570
<32-9,House>阑尾
<32-9,House>The appendix.

593
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:39,310
<32-10,Wilson>恭喜 你恐怕救了她的命呢

<32-10,Wilson>You definitely saved herabcneedless surgery.

595
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:45,970
<32-11,House>是哦
<32-11,House>Yes,I did.

596
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:50,000
<32-11,House>手术室分机号是多少? 好奇问问
<32-11,House>What's the O.R.Extensionabcnumber? Just curious.

597
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,320
<33-1,Morgan>谢谢你
<33-1,Morgan>Thank you.

598
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:06,210
<33-2,House>我可不是来讨你一声谢的abc那多没风度
<33-2,House>I wouldn't come here for thanks.abcThat would be ungracious.

599
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,900
<33-2,House>我是来幸灾乐祸的
<33-2,House>It's more about gloating.

600
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:15,950
<33-2,House>就因为迷信 你就差点丢了块脑子
<33-2,House>You were about to cut out a piece of yourabcbrain just to chase some crazy superstition.

601
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:17,940
<33-3,Morgan>但我没丢啊
<33-3,Morgan>But I didn't.

602
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:21,580
<33-4,House>你啥忙都"没"帮上abc是我阻止这一切的
<33-4,House>You "didn't" didn't doabcanything. I stopped it.

603
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:25,080
<33-5,Morgan>那你是怎么做到的?
<33-5,Morgan>And what made you do that?

604
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:28,500
<33-6,House>科学 逻辑 推理 任选其三
<33-6,House>Science,logic,reason. Pick any three.

605
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:33,120
<33-7,Morgan>那只猫偏偏选中那一刻abc跳到你电脑上
<33-7,Morgan>A cat chooses that exactabcmoment to sit on your computer.

606
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:37,980
<33-7,Morgan>也许是科学 逻辑和推理的功劳abc也许是别的呢
<33-7,Morgan>Maybe that's science and logic andabcreason or maybe it's something else.

607
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:44,180
<33-8,House>你真是个白痴
<33-8,House>You're an idiot.

608
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:49,790
<33-9,Morgan>我查过了纽约的那位传教士
<33-9,Morgan>I looked up theabcpreacher from new york state.

609
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:52,890
<33-9,Morgan>他的跟随者从未断绝过
<33-9,Morgan>His followers never faded out.

610
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:56,800
<33-9,Morgan>这些人成立了后来的abc基督复临安息日会 一个重要的教派
<33-9,Morgan>They became the seventh-dayabcadventists,a major religion.

611
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:58,530
<33-9,Morgan>那传教士改写了历史的进程啊
<33-9,Morgan>That man changed the course of history.

612
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:02,800
<33-10,House>因为他的跟随者abc都跟他一样执迷不悟
<33-10,House>Because his followers wereabcas deluded as he was.

613
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,920
<33-11,Morgan>也许他确实让他们找到了生活的意义
<33-11,Morgan>Maybe he just gaveabcthem something to live for.

614
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:14,570
<33-12,House>感觉好些了
<33-12,House>Feel better.

620
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:19,660
<34-5,Kutner>我也不确定
<34-5,Kutner>I'm not sure.

621
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:22,150
<34-6,Thirteen>我敢说他被你的坚决反抗雷到了
<34-6,Thirteen>I guess he was impressed youabcstood up to him.
