62
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,780
<3-10,Foreman>就是说她的血液本身有问题--

<3-16,House>这不是意见 这是烟幕
<3-16,House>It's not an opinion.abcIt's a smoke screen.

71
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:41,330
<3-16,House>因为你担心会让别人发现abc他勇敢地踏入了那片处女地
<3-16,House>because you're worried that'll confirm thatabche's boldly gone where no man has gone before.

72
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,280

<3-20,House>It's extremely relevant.

77
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:53,060

<3-20,House>Apparently, it colors everything.

78
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,060
<3-20,House>现在我搞不清楚abc你们提出不同意见
<3-20,House>Now I have no idea if youabchave differing opinions

79
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:59,500
<3-20,House>是真的意见向左 还是纯粹为了abc证明你们仍有独立思考的能力
<3-20,House>because you have differing opinions or because you'reabcjust trying to prove that you can think for yourselves.

80
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,170
<3-21,Thirteen>你为什么不能只凭意见abc本身来判断它的正误呢?
<3-21,Thirteen>How about you just judge ourabcideas on their own merit?

81
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,800
<3-22,House>你不会想我这么做的
<3-22,House>Oh, you don't want me to do that.

83
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:11,760

<3-22,House>Then you can come back andabcpretend to disagree about why.

<5-10,Cuddy>I know I'm supposed to feel amazement.

120
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:28,570
<5-10,Cuddy>感觉到对她的爱 但我...
<5-10,Cuddy>I'm supposed to love her. I just...

121
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:32,800
<5-10,Cuddy>什么也感觉不到
<5-10,Cuddy>I don't feel anything at all.

122
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:38,680
<5-10,Cuddy>对不起 也许我真的累了
<5-10,Cuddy>Sorry. Maybe I am just tired.

123
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:42,850
<5-10,Cuddy>谢谢你路过来看我 我没事
<5-10,Cuddy>thank you for stopping by. I'm okay.

124
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:46,890
<5-11,Wilson>Lisa... 如果你...
<5-11,Wilson>Lisa... if you're...

125
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:51,690
<5-12,Cuddy>我会喂她吃东西abc给她换尿布 照顾她
<5-12,Cuddy>I am feeding her, I'm changingabcher,and I'm burping her.

126
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:54,520
<5-12,Cuddy>做一切我应该做的事
<5-12,Cuddy>I'm doing everything I'm supposed to do.

127
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:57,410
<5-12,Cuddy>她会好好的
<5-12,Cuddy>She will be okay.

128
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:00,970
<5-12,Cuddy>回去上班吧
<5-12,Cuddy>Please go back to work.

129
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:14,620
<6-1,Thirteen>是血液本身导致abc但不是凝血蛋白的问题
<6-1,Thirteen>it is the blood, but the clottingabcproteins aren't the problem.

130
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,300
<6-2,Foreman>是血小板 看起来像被咬过似的
<6-2,Foreman>It's her platelets, lookedabclike they had bite marks in them.

131
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,570
<6-3,House>你们意见一致了?
<6-3,House>So now you're agreeing?

132
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:22,540
<6-3,House>要么是因为我揶揄你们而抱团abc要么是分手了 要么--
<6-3,House>Either you folded because I gaveabcyou crap, or you broke up, or--

133
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:24,370
<6-4,Foreman>我们意见不合 你怪在我们的关系头上
<6-4,Foreman>we disagree,you blame our relationship.

134
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,190
<6-4,Foreman>我们达成一致 你还是怪在这上面
<6-4,Foreman>We agree, you blame our relationship.

135
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,890
<6-4,Foreman>- 发现问题出在哪了吗?abc- 发现了 你没有么?
<6-4,Foreman>- Don't you see a problem there?abc- Yes. Don't you?

136
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:29,990
<6-6,Taub>可能是淋巴癌
<6-6,Taub>could be lymphoma.

137
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,500
<6-7,House>乳酸脱氢酶正常
<6-7,House>Not with normal ldh.

138
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,910
<6-8,Kutner>特发性血小板减少性紫癜(I.T.P)abc符合症状 应该给她用甲氨蝶呤
<6-8,Kutner>I.T.P.Fits. We shouldabcstart her on methotrexate.

139
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:37,150
<6-9,House>没错 去给她做全身放疗
<6-9,House>Absolutely,and total body irradiation.

140
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:39,240
<6-10,Taub>就凭出血时间不正常这一症状?
<6-10,Taub>Because she failed a bleeding-time test?

141
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:41,770
<6-11,Kutner>全身放疗会使癌症恶化abc并毁掉她的消化系统
<6-11,Kutner>tbi will promote cancers,abckill her digestive tract.

142
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:44,330
<6-12,House>但别忘了-- 阻止血液流入脑部
<6-12,House>Don't forget--stop her fromabcbleeding into her brain.

143
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:47,090
<6-13,Kutner>这是一个不成熟 不顾后果abc而且可能使病人致死的疗法
<6-13,Kutner>It's premature, reckless,andabcpotentially lethal.

144
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:51,620
<6-14,House>没错 某人有责任阻止我这种abc不顾后果且不负责任的行为
<6-14,House>True. Must be somebody's job to stopabcme from being reckless and irresponsible.

145
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:54,430
<6-14,House>但没人能阻止我不成熟
<6-14,House>Nobody can stop me from being premature.

146
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,440
<7-1,House>病人患有I.T.P
<7-1,House>Got a patient with I.T.P.

147
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:02,410
<7-1,House>要给她做全身放疗
<7-1,House>Need to hit her with radiation.

148
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:03,860
<7-2,Cameron>我回头打给你
<7-2,Cameron>I'm gonna have to call you back.

149
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,730
<7-3,House>- 用甲氨蝶呤abc- 好主意
<7-3,House>- Methotrexate.abc- Good point.

150
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:10,850
<7-3,House>但一旦血液流入她的脑部abc她自己也要接受特殊教育了
<7-3,House>On the other hand, if she bleeds in her brain,abcshe's gonna need a special ed. Class of her own.

151
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:14,700
<7-4,Cameron>好吧
<7-4,Cameron>Fine.

152
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:18,800
<7-6,Cameron>- 真的?abc- 真的 你觉得合适就去做吧
<7-6,Cameron>- Really?abc- Yeah, if you think it's right, do it.

153
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:23,830
<7-7,House>有人认为 你会使出霹雳手腕以建立威信
<7-7,House>Some people thought you were gonnaabcbe brutal, marking your territory.

154
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,930
<7-8,Cameron>- 谁?abc- 谁也不是
<7-8,Cameron>- Who?abc- Nobody.

155
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,480
<7-9,House>虽然我说他"谁也不是"abc不代表我有种族歧视
<7-9,House>Just because I call himabcnobody doesn't make me a racist.

156
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,570
<7-10,Cameron>我不是在和你玩
<7-10,Cameron>I'm not gonna play games.

157
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:34,160
<7-10,Cameron>你向我提出申请 如果具有abc医学上的合理性 我会答应
<7-10,Cameron>If you come to me with a request andabcit makes medical sense,I'll say yes.

158
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:38,040
<7-11,House>我需要口交
<7-11,House>I need oral sex.

159
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:42,350
<7-11,House>我很肯定abc生理的迫切性等同医学的合理性
<7-11,House>I'm pretty sure biologicalabcimperative qualifies as medical sense.

160
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,510
<7-12,Cameron>我可以回电话了吗?
<7-12,Cameron>Can I return my phone call now?

161
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,720
<7-13,House>我看不出有什么理由让你回
<7-13,House>I don't really see howabcthat's gonna be possible.

162
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:03,130
<8-1,Thirteen>甲氨蝶呤对病人不起作用abc出血时间也没有改善
<8-1,Thirteen>patient won't respond to methotrexate.abcBleeding time hasn't improved.

163
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,780
<8-2,House>你给我出了个难题abc我也给你出一个
<8-2,House>You havea medical dilemmaabcfor me. I have one for you.

164
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:08,450
<8-2,House>给我一个不做全身放疗的理由
<8-2,House>I need a reason to notabcdototal body irradiation.

165
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,390
<8-3,Foreman>Cameron不是给你了吗?
<8-3,Foreman>Other than that cameron said you can'T.

166
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:11,480
<8-4,House>她说我可以
<8-4,House>She said I can.

167
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,940
<8-5,Kutner>那我们照做就是了
<8-5,Kutner>Then why don't we just do it?

168
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:16,160
<8-6,House>但这是一个不成熟 不顾后果abc而且可能使病人致死的疗法
<8-6,House>Because it's premature,reckless,abcand potentially lethal.

169
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:18,260
<8-7,Kutner>那我们不做不就完了?
<8-7,Kutner>Then why don't we just don't do it?

170
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:20,960
<8-8,House>这会让Cameron发现abc我根本就没打算做放疗
<8-8,House>Because that would let cameron in onabcthe fact that I never intended to do it.

171
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,420
<8-9,Taub>你把我们都绕糊涂了
<8-9,Taub>This is gonna be convoluted,isn't it?

172
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:25,240
<8-10,House>我原本的计划是abc向她提一个不靠谱的要求
<8-10,House>I figured I'd ask forabcsomething really crazy,

173
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:29,840
<8-10,House>她会把我毙了abc小脑瓜里得出"House太难扼制"的结论
<8-10,House>so she'd shoot me down and get the whole "I canabccontrol house" thing out of her perky little system.

174
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,500
<8-10,House>那下次我向她提出一个稍微靠谱的要求
<8-10,House>So the next time I went back andabcasked for something marginally crazy,

175
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:35,600
<8-10,House>听起来合理多了abc她就会答应
<8-10,House>it would seem marginally reasonable,abcand she'd say yes.

176
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:38,630
<8-10,House>的确有点曲折
<8-10,House>So, yeah, slightly convoluted.

177
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,100
<8-11,Taub>你糗大了
<8-11,Taub>You're screwed.

178
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:42,370
<8-12,Thirteen>除非我们只...
<8-12,Thirteen>Unlesswe irradiate her...

179
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:46,610
<8-12,Thirteen>走个过场 我们预定治疗室abc填妥所有文件
<8-12,Thirteen>without the radiation. We book theabcnuclear lab. We fill out the paperwork.

180
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,910
<8-12,Thirteen>把病人带到那里 把所有程序走一遍abc但不必按下按钮
<8-12,Thirteen>We bring the patient down there. Weabcdo everything but flip the switch.

181
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,810
<8-13,House>去吧 千万别按钮
<8-13,House>Go. Do. Don't flip.

182
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:57,670
<8-14,Taub>我们是不是应该做点别的abc真正对病人有帮助的事?
<8-14,Taub>And is there anything we should be doing,abcyou know, to actually help the patient?

183
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,520
<8-15,House>相信我 从长远角度考虑abc这对所有病人都有帮助
<8-15,House>Trust me. In the longabcterm,this'll help all our patients.

184
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:04,460
<8-15,House>就短期而言 把甲氨蝶呤的剂量加一倍abc并加入强的松
<8-15,House>In the short term, double the doseabcof methotrexate and add prednisone.

185
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:10,050
<9-1,Chase>Cameron得到了城堡的钥匙
<9-1,Chase>Caron's got the keys to the castle.

186
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:12,740
<9-2,Foreman>我主持的那个实验--abc药物似乎真的有效
<9-2,Foreman>This trial I'm running--theabcdrug really seems to be working.

187
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,130
<9-3,Chase>似乎她喜欢掌握这种力量
<9-3,Chase>She's kind of liking the power.

188
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:17,750
<9-3,Chase>似乎我也喜欢这样的她
<9-3,Chase>I think I'm kind of liking her liking it.

189
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,840
<9-4,Foreman>我不知道拿13怎么办
<9-4,Foreman>I'm not sure what I'mabcgonna do about thirteen.

190
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:22,700
<9-5,Chase>她打扮得像Cuddy
<9-5,Chase>She's sort of dressing like cuddy.

191
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:25,810
<9-6,Foreman>她用的是安慰剂
<9-6,Foreman>She's on the placebo.

192
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:27,150
<9-7,Chase>你怎么可能发现
<9-7,Chase>You can't possibly know that.

193
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,920
<9-8,Foreman>出了点状况 总之我发现了
<9-8,Foreman>Accidents happen. I found out.

194
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:36,150
<9-8,Foreman>你不能告诉她
<9-8,Foreman>You can not tell her.

195
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,750
<9-9,Chase>这会破坏实验的准确性
<9-9,Chase>You'd be compromising the trial.

196
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,760
<9-9,Chase>她清楚自己只有abc一半机会得到药物
<9-9,Chase>She knows she had a 50/50abcchance of not being on the drug.

197
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:44,870
<9-9,Chase>如果你觉得自己欺骗了她abc那就太糟了
<9-9,Chase>If you feel like you'reabclying to her, too bad.

198
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:47,260
<9-10,Foreman>我不打算告诉她
<9-10,Foreman>I don't want to tell her.

199
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,990
<9-10,Foreman>我想让她用药物
<9-10,Foreman>I want to put her on the real drug.

200
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:53,870
<9-11,Chase>而且你指望我告诉你abc这没有问题?
<9-11,Chase>And you want me to tellabcyou that that's okay?

201
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,760
<9-12,Foreman>从我知道她用的什么药起abc试验结果就已经受到干扰了
<9-12,Foreman>Her trial results are already compromised,abcjust from the fact that I know.

202
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:02,520
<9-12,Foreman>既然都是浪费时间abc干嘛不给她用些有效的药呢?
<9-12,Foreman>As long as she's wasting her time, why notabcgive her something that might actually help her?

203
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:07,830
<9-13,Chase>理由充分 -- 简直是一派胡言
<9-13,Chase>Valid point, except for theabcfact that it's a load of crap.

204
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,850
<9-13,Chase>别犯傻了
<9-13,Chase>Don't be an idiot.

205
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:24,960
<10-1,Sarah>要等多久才能开始啊?
<10-1,Sarah>So how long until we start the procedure?

206
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,790
<10-2,Thirteen>已经开始了 都说你感觉不到的啦
<10-2,Thirteen>we already started. Toldabcyou you wouldn't feel a thing.

207
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:32,410
<10-3,Taub>你得躺下 躺着别动
<10-3,Taub>You should lie back.abcJust stay real still.

208
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,270
<10-4,Pan Am Clerk>我觉得你旁边有人坐了
<10-4,Pan Am Clerk>I'm afraid there is someoneabcsitting next to you.

209
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:37,600
<10-5,Fletch>哦 天啊 天啊
<10-5,Fletch>Oh, for--god,abcgod, god!

<10-6,Sarah>I have to pee.

211
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:44,380
<10-6,Sarah>我们能不能先暂停一下abc让我去个洗手间?
<10-6,Sarah>Can we, like, call a time out forabca minute, let me go to the bhroom?

212
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:49,040
<10-7,Thirteen>可以啊 没问题abc等你搞定我们再重新开始吧
<10-7,Thirteen>Yeah, sure. We'll just startabcup again when you're done.

213
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:53,580
<10-8,Sarah>谢谢 抱歉 我刚没觉得想上厕所
<10-8,Sarah>Thanks. Sorry. I-Iabcdidn't realize I had to go.

214
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:55,450
<10-9,Taub>没关系
<10-9,Taub>No problem.

215
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,940
<10-10,Thirteen>Sarah?
<10-10,Thirteen>Sarah?

216
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:05,490
<10-11,Taub>没有脉搏了 去拿除颤器
<10-11,Taub>No pulse. Get the paddles.

217
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:12,150
<10-12,Thirteen>闪开!

00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,860
<10-13,Taub>有脉搏了
<10-13,Taub>Got a pulse.

219
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,580
<10-13,Taub>不是特发性血小板减少性紫癫
<10-13,Taub>It's not I.T.P.

220
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:21,350
<10-13,Taub>她显然不需要假放疗
<10-13,Taub>She clearly doesn't need fake radiation.

221
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,950
<11-1,Kutner>她的心脏没有结构缺陷
<11-1,Kutner>no structural defects in her heart.

222
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,900
<11-2,Thirteen>会不会是瓣膜钙化 或卵圆孔未闭?
<11-2,Thirteen>what about a calcified valveabcor a patent for a men ovale?

223
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:31,220
<11-3,Taub>胸腔共振和气泡试验都没问题abc她心脏好着呢
<11-3,Taub>Transthoracic echo and bubble studiesabcshow nothing. Her heart's clean.

224
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,910
<11-4,Thirteen>病人说她想上厕所
<11-4,Thirteen>The patient said she had to go pee.

225
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:35,470
<11-4,Thirteen>可能她站起来的时候 就开始排尿
<11-4,Thirteen>Maybe when she gotabcup,she started to urinate.

226
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,550
<11-4,Thirteen>增加迷走神经张力 使心律失常abc最终心跳骤停
<11-4,Thirteen>Increased the vagal tone, causedabcarrhythmia,and stopped her heart.

227
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:41,420
<11-5,House>化疗的时候谁还会想撒尿啊?
<11-5,House>Who has to go pee in theabcmiddle of a nuclear procedure?

228
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,010
<11-6,Kutner>没有真正给她做放疗
<11-6,Kutner>It wasn't really a nuclear procedure.

229
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,390
<11-7,House>但她不知道
<11-7,House>She didn't know that.

230
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:49,800
<11-7,House>人不会因为撒个尿就挂了
<11-7,House>People don't die from peeing.

231
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:51,600
<11-8,Kutner>重金属中毒
<11-8,Kutner>Heavy metal,toxin.

232
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,760
<11-9,Taub>吸毒 酗酒
<11-9,Taub>Drugs or alcohol.

233
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,980
<11-10,Thirteen>或者她自身制造毒素呢
<11-10,Thirteen>Or her own body is making a toxin.

234
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:58,510
<11-10,Thirteen>冷凝集素 异常蛋白质被低温活化
<11-10,Thirteen>Cold agglutinins-- abnormal proteinabcgets activatedby cold temperatures.

235
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:01,720
<11-11,Forbes>就好像教室暖气坏了abc治疗室的金属床也够冷
<11-11,Forbes>Like the classroom with the broken heater andabcthe cold metal table in the procedure room.

236
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,380
<11-12,House>哦 拜托 少妇唱夫随了
<11-12,House>Oh, for god's sake,get a room.

237
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:05,970
<11-12,House>给她用个冰浴
<11-12,House>Immerse her in an ice bath.

238
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:07,900
<11-12,House>足够活化冷凝集素了
<11-12,House>The cold will activateherabccold agglutinins.

239
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:08,970
<11-13,Kutner>会使她心跳过速
<11-13,Kutner>Causing her heart to race.

240
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:10,370
<11-14,House>正好证明了我们的诊断
<11-14,House>Confirming our diagnosis.

241
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:11,960
<11-15,Kutner>也会再次使她心力衰竭
<11-15,Kutner>And giving her another heart attack.

242
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:16,180
<11-16,House>我真好命 有位金发美眉就爱说"好"
<11-16,House>Lucky for me,there's a flaxen-hairedabcmaiden who loves to say yes.

243
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:23,310
<12-1,Cuddy>你怎能同意给一个可能患有abc特发性紫癫的病人做全身放射?
<12-1,Cuddy>How in the world could you approve total bodyabcirradiation for a patient with possible I.T.P.?

244
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:24,200
<12-2,Cameron>这么做没问题
<12-2,Cameron>It was the right call.

245
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,860
<12-3,Cuddy>还没有正当的医疗理由...
<12-3,Cuddy>There is no medical justificationabcfor that kind of--

246
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:29,810
<12-4,Cameron>跟医学无关abc根本不存在医学合理性
<12-4,Cameron>not medically, no. Absolutely noabcmedical rationalization.

247
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:33,280
<12-4,Cameron>我必须同意 因为House想让我否掉
<12-4,Cameron>I had to say yes becauseabchouse wanted me to say no.

248
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:34,480
<12-5,Cuddy>你觉得他是吓唬你呢
<12-5,Cuddy>You think he was bluffing.

249
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:36,530
<12-6,Cameron>我是新人 他当然会试探我
<12-6,Cameron>I'm the new kid. He had to test me.

250
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:39,250
<12-7,Cuddy>别耍小聪明 别入戏
<12-7,Cuddy>Don't get cute. Don't engage him.

251
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:42,100
<12-7,Cuddy>跟他过招 你输定了
<12-7,Cuddy>Do not play hisabcgames,because you will lose.

252
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:44,580
<12-8,Cameron>你把这活交给我 就放手让我做啊
<12-8,Cameron>You hired me to doabcthis job. Let me do it.

253
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:50,070
<12-8,Cameron>哦 我真抱歉
<12-8,Cameron>Oh, I'm sorry.

254
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,840
<12-9,House>你俩貌似正聊着天呢
<12-9,House>Looks like you guys are inabcthe middle of a conversation.

255
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:55,160
<12-9,House>我等Cuddy走了再说
<12-9,House>I can wait till cuddy leaves.

256
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:58,800
<12-9,House>反正你马上就走 对吧?
<12-9,House>You are gonna leave soon,aren't you?

257
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:01,700
<12-9,House>你看 你的小宝宝让护士抱着呢
<12-9,House>I mean, the nurses haveabcgot your baby out there.

258
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:03,280
<12-9,House>倒不是说她们能把宝宝绑架了
<12-9,House>Not that they're gonnaabckidnap it or anything,

259
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:08,590
<12-9,House>但我觉着新妈妈把宝宝带来上班abc就是为了听别人咿咿呀呀逗孩子
<12-9,House>but I figured that the new mother brings the babyabcto wo because she wants to listen to all the cooing.

260
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:10,890
<12-10,Cameron>你要等 就出去等着
<12-10,Cameron>If you're gonna wait,youabccan wait outside.

261
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:15,900
<12-11,House>除非 新妈妈把宝宝带来上班abc是因为她不想要这宝宝了
<12-11,House>Unless the new mother brings the baby toabcwork because she wants to dump the baby,

262
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:21,410
<12-11,House>因为她讨厌这宝宝abc觉得她犯了个大错
<12-11,House>because she hates the baby andabcthinks she made a big mistake.

263
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:27,490
<12-11,House>Wilson那家伙可靠不住
<12-11,House>Can't trust that wilsonabcguy with anything.

264
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,300
<12-13,Cuddy>- Lisa 你是不是...abc- 没什么大不了 我那天情况很糟
<12-13,Cuddy>- Lisa, are you-- - it's not aabcbig deal.I was having a bad day.

265
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:33,490
<12-14,House>Wilson是不是死定了?
<12-14,House>Is wilson gonna be in trouble?

266
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,400
<12-15,Cuddy>就因为在我脆弱的时候abc背叛了我的信任? 不会
<12-15,Cuddy>For betraying my trustinabca vulnerable time? No.

267
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:37,570
<12-15,Cuddy>我有啥好介意的?
<12-15,Cuddy>Why would that bother me?

268
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,060
<12-16,House>他很担心 所以说漏嘴
<12-16,House>He was worried,made a bad choice.

269
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:46,540
<12-16,House>没啥大不了的 我知道这看上去糟透了
<12-16,House>It's not a big deal. Iabcknow it seems like crap.

270
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:48,880
<12-16,House>你感觉也糟透了 但实际并非如此
<12-16,House>You probably feelabclike crap,but it's not.

271
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:51,930
<12-16,House>法律上讲 你还不算领养了她呢abc没啥义务 也没啥条件
<12-16,House>Legally, you haven't adopted her yet.abcThere's no obligations, no strings.

272
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,590
<12-16,House>明天都可以反悔
<12-16,House>It can be undone tomorrow.

273
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:58,300
<12-16,House>感情上 你会内疚好一阵子abc但那孩子嘛...
<12-16,House>Emotionally, you'll feelabcguilty for a while, but the kid--

274
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:01,090
<12-16,House>她都不会知道有你
<12-16,House>she won't even know you existed.

275
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,710
<12-17,Cuddy>你是说 我该把她还回去?
<12-17,Cuddy>You saying I should give her back?

276
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,420
<12-18,House>总好过有个漠不关心她的妈妈
<12-18,House>Much better than having aabcmother who doesn't give a crap.

277
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:10,100
<12-18,House>多谢了
<12-18,House>Thanks.

278
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:12,940
<12-19,Cuddy>我这就去把她扔到动物收容所
<12-19,Cuddy>I'm just gonna go dropabcit off at the pound.

279
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:20,000
<12-20,Cameron>你究竟想怎样啊?
<12-20,Cameron>What did you want?

280
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,640
<13-1,House>拿到"通行证"了
<13-1,House>We got a green light.

281
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:25,080
<13-1,House>去给病人抽血吧
<13-1,House>Go draw the patient's blood.

282
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:26,520
<13-2,Thirteen>为啥?
<13-2,Thirteen>Why?

283
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,270
<13-3,House>看看在冰水里能凝结不
<13-3,House>To see if it clumps in the cold.

284
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,670
<13-4,Thirteen>她说服了你在治疗前先确认?
<13-4,Thirteen>She's making you confirm yourabctheory before you treat?

285
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,220
<13-5,House>她同意冰浴
<13-5,House>She approved the bath.

286
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,810
<13-5,House>但我觉得还是先确认一下好
<13-5,House>Just thought we outabcto do a test to confirm.

287
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,640
<13-6,Kutner>感觉不像拿到"通行证"了啊 是吧?
<13-6,Kutner>That's more of a yellow light, isn't it?

288
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:39,040
<13-7,Taub>她让你给病人做放射 没问题
<13-7,Taub>so she let's you nukeabcthe patient, no problem,

289
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:42,840
<13-7,Taub>但冰浴前要你先费功夫证实?
<13-7,Taub>but makes you jump throughabchoops to give her a bath?

290
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,540
<13-7,Taub>她为啥这么做?
<13-7,Taub>Why would she do that?

291
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,990
<13-8,Forman>我觉着她是耍你呢
<13-8,Forman>I think she was playing you.

292
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,830
<13-9,House>给我抽血去

297
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:04,360
<14-4,Kutner>我需要抽些血
<14-4,Kutner>I need to draw some blood.

298

<14-4,Kutner>我四年级的时候迷上了我的老师abc五年级也是
<14-4,Kutner>I had a crush on my teacherabcin fourth grade... and fifth.

<14-5,Tammy>事实上 Johnny有非语言自闭症
<14-5,Tammy>It's more that johnnyabcwas a nonverbal autistic.

300
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:16,790

<14-5,Tammy>她病了之后 他又开始疏远我们
<14-5,Tammy>Since she got sick, heabcstarted going back away from us.

303
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,540
<14-5,Tammy>我不得不带他来探病
<14-5,Tammy>I had to bring him in for a visit.

304
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:28,820
<14-6,Kutner>这样吧 我把百叶窗关上abc护士就不会来难为你们了
<14-6,Kutner>I'll tell you what-- I'll close theabcbnds so the nurses don't ask questions.

305

<14-6,Kutner>你们想待多久都成
<14-6,Kutner>You can stay as long as you want.

00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:55,490
<15-5,Foreman>还是别高兴得太早
<15-5,Foreman>Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

<15-5,Foreman>你用的可能都不是真的药物啊

320
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:10,640

<18-6,Sarah>我是说 他不会去读报
<18-6,Sarah>I mean,he wouldn't read it.

336
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:18,690
<18-6,Sarah>他就只是去抚摸报纸 把它揉皱
<18-6,Sarah>He would just-- justabctouch it, crinkle it.

337
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:23,360
<18-6,Sarah>我琢磨这是个突破口 用纸塑 然后...
<18-6,Sarah>I thought maybe that was aabcway in, papier mache and...

338
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,530
<18-6,Sarah>果然有用
<18-6,Sarah>And it was.

339
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,360
<18-6,Sarah>他接受了我
<18-6,Sarah>He let me into his world.

340
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,950
<18-7,House>麻烦跟她说 讲话会破坏测试结果
<18-7,House>Please tell her thatabctalking will ruin the test.

341
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:36,900
<18-8,Sarah>所有的孩子... 我试着去影响他们abc也让他们影响我
<18-8,Sarah>All the kids--I-I try to become a part ofabcthem, and then have them become a part of me.

342
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:39,460
<18-9,House>她还得多久才心力衰竭啊?
<18-9,House>How much longer till the heart attack?

343
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:42,100
<18-10,Kutner>我从八岁就想当个医生
<18-10,Kutner>I wanted to be a doctor fromabcthe time I was eight years old.

344
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,500
<18-10,Kutner>但是从来都不想做儿科医生
<18-10,Kutner>Never wanted to be aabcpediatrician, though.

345
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:45,140
<18-11,House>现在他俩都说个不停了
<18-11,House>Now they're both talking.

346
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,800
<18-10,Kutner>我本想做个社会学家的
<18-10,Kutner>well, I wanted to be a sociologist.

347
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,320
<18-12,Sarah>我本来是去旁听的
<18-12,Sarah>I was sued to observe a class.

348
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:53,510
<18-12,Sarah>他们让我去214教室
<18-12,Sarah>I was sent toabcroom 2-- 214,

349
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,590
<18-12,Sarah>我却跑去了241
<18-12,Sarah>but I went to room 241 instead.

350
00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:00,420
<18-12,Sarah>是堂特殊教育课 我就...
<18-12,Sarah>It was a special ed.abcClass, and I just...

351
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:03,460
<18-12,Sarah>感觉像回到了家里一样
<18-12,Sarah>I just felt at home.

352
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:04,970
<18-13,Thirteen>时间到 心率正常
<18-13,Thirteen>Time. Heart rate's normal.

353
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:07,150
<18-14,Kutner>你可以出来了
<18-14,Kutner>You can get out now.

354
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:11,110
<18-15,Taub>不是冷凝集素的原因
<18-15,Taub>It's not cold agglutinins.

355
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:14,390
<18-16,House>一点也不出奇
<18-16,House>I'm not surprised.

356
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,160
<18-16,House>她大脑肯定有损伤
<18-16,House>She obviously has brain damage.

357
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,400
<18-16,House>没开玩笑
<18-16,House>Seriously.

358
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:26,070
<19-1,Taub>她六年前搞错了个教室号abc你就推断她有大脑损伤?
<19-1,Taub>She screwed up a room number six yearsabcago, and you decide she has brain damage?

359
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:31,320
<19-2,House>数字调位 是数感混淆的典型征兆
<19-2,House>Transposed digits-- classicabcmarker for number confusion.

360
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:34,250
<19-2,House>说明她海马旁左区域有损伤
<19-2,House>Means she has a lesion inabcher left parahippocampal region.

361
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:36,890
<19-3,Kutner>我今早还拨错电话号码呢abc这病肯定传染
<19-3,Kutner>I misdialed a phone number thisabcmorning. Must be contagious.

362
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,740
<19-4,House>那个假测试之前 她也忘了去上厕所
<19-4,House>She also forgot toabcpee before your fake test.

363
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,930
<19-5,Kutner>只能说明她膀胱小
<19-5,Kutner>So she hasa small bladder.

364
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:42,900
<19-6,House>是说明她无法预知可见的未来
<19-6,House>Shows an inability to predict the future.

365
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:47,170
<19-7,Thirteen>这在左脑半球 离海马旁区域可真近啊
<19-7,Thirteen>Also located in the left hemisphere of theabcbrain, close to the parahippocampal region.

366
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:48,550
<19-8,House>说明损伤正不断发展
<19-8,House>Means the damage is ongoing.

367
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,670
<19-9,Taub>两个细微的线索 中间还隔了6年abc这实在无法令人信服
<19-9,Taub>Two subtle clues six years apart--abcthat's hardly compelling evidence.

368
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,720
<19-10,House>- 我很信服吖abc- 压根不是这回事
<19-10,House>- I'm compelled.abc- That's not what this is.

369
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:57,370
<19-11,Foreman>每次有个善良的病人abc你就千方百计想证明他们脑病
<19-11,Foreman>Every time a decent person comes in, youabcset out to prove that they have brain damage.

370
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,150
<19-12,House>我可没说她错乱的人格也是症状
<19-12,House>I never said herabcderanged personality was a symptom.

371
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:02,070
<19-13,Foreman>你压根用不着开口 我都在这干了5年了
<19-13,Foreman>You don't need to. I'veabcbeen here five years.

372
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,770
<19-13,Foreman>你心里想啥 我在家里都能听得一清二楚
<19-13,Foreman>I can hear yourabcthoughts from my apartment.

373
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:08,430
<19-14,House>你现在听到点啥?
<19-14,House>Can you hear me now?

374
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:10,670
<19-15,Foreman>换个器官琢磨吧
<19-15,Foreman>Move onto another organ.

375
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,570
<19-16,House>我换了啊
<19-16,House>I did.

376
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:15,740
<19-17,Kutner>把数字搞错 忘了上厕所abc只能说明她也是个人
<19-17,Kutner>The screwed up numbers and forgettingabcto pee points to her being a human being.

377
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:19,230
<19-17,Kutner>血小板功能障碍 心跳骤停abc说明她有胰腺肿瘤
<19-17,Kutner>The platelet dysfunctionand cardiacabcarrest points to a pancreatic tumor.

378
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:22,650
<19-18,House>或多发性硬化
<19-18,House>Or multiple sclerosis.

379
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:25,020
<19-18,House>大脑就跟互联网一样
<19-18,House>The brain is likeabcthe internet--

380
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:28,880
<19-18,House>一个又一个数据包 不断地被传送
<19-18,House>packets of information constantlyabcflowing from one area to another.

381
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:33,140
<19-18,House>她大脑里的硬化abc就像是个破烂服务器 拖慢了网速
<19-18,House>Plaques in her brain are like aabcbad server, slow down the flow.

382
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:36,510
<19-18,House>如果是在海马旁区域abc就会扩散到脑干
<19-18,House>If it's in the parahippocampus,abcit'll spread to the brain stem,

383
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,060
<19-18,House>说明下一个就轮到肺了
<19-18,House>which means it'll be the lungs next.

384
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:42,010
<19-18,House>做个大脑活检 就能看到硬化
<19-18,House>Brain biopsy will show you the plaques.

385
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:44,590
<19-19,Kutner>我们也可以不开她的脑
<19-19,Kutner>Or we could not cut into her brain.

386
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,120
<19-19,Kutner>只是胰腺的问题abc做个内镜逆行胰胆管造影就行
<19-19,Kutner>It's just her pancreas.abcWe should do an ercp.

387
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:51,010
<19-20,House>要不咱石头剪子布 但...
<19-20,House>Well, we could settle this withabcrock, paper, scissors, but...

388
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:54,590
<19-20,House>很不幸 这事有人说了算
<19-20,House>unfortunately,there are peopleabcwho adjudicate these disputes.

389
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:57,480
<20-1,Kutner>胰腺肿瘤对她来说更致命
<20-1,Kutner>A pancreatic tumor is muchabcmore likely to kill her.

390
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:00,050
<20-2,House>这周死不了 下周死不了abc下个月都死不了
<20-2,House>Not this week, not nextabcweek,not next month.

391
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,640
<20-3,Kutner>数感混淆6年前就有了
<20-3,Kutner>The number confusions six years ago.

392
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:02,950
<20-3,Kutner>就做个内镜逆行胰胆管造影abc难道这点时间都没有?
<20-3,Kutner>You don't think weabchave time for an ercp?

393
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,900
<20-4,House>心力衰竭是才6小时之前的事
<20-4,House>The heart attack was six hours ago.

394
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:07,120
<20-4,House>这症状可能也打算abc先躲个几年再说
<20-4,House>Now, maybe it's planning toabcgo into hiding for a couple years,

395
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:08,310
<20-4,House>也可能攻击她的肺部
<20-4,House>or maybe it's gonna hit her lungs.

396
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,700
<20-4,House>别吵了!
<20-4,House>Stop!

397
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:13,510
<20-5,Cameron>必须假定是脑部的问题
<20-5,Cameron>We have to assume it's the brain.

398
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:16,060
<20-6,House>我这就去发动电钻 准备开脑
<20-6,House>I'll go fire up the biopsy drill.

399
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:19,850
<20-7,Cameron>不行 我们假定是脑部的问题abc除非证明是别的
<20-7,Cameron>No, we had to assume it's theabcbrain until we prove otherwise.

400
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,520
<20-7,Cameron>做个核磁共振 T-2成像
<20-7,Cameron>Do an mri, t-2 images.

401
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:25,760
<20-8,House>你要我再做个测试?
<20-8,House>You want me to do another test?

402
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:27,700
<20-9,Cameron>应该会看到多发性硬化病灶
<20-9,Cameron>You should be ableabcto see the M.S.Plaques.

403
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:30,610
<20-9,Cameron>如果有 你就可以做活检
<20-9,Cameron>If they exist,you can do your biopsy.

404
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:34,610
<28-9,House>不
<28-9,House>No.

405
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:38,310
<28-10,Cameron>你想同意我
<28-10,Cameron>You want to say yes.

406
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:43,000
<20-9,Cameron>你知道你应该同意 但也知道abc这份工作就是要跟我对着干
<20-9,Cameron>You know you should say yes, but you alsoabcthink that this job is about standing up to me.

407
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:46,790
<20-10,House>所以你既不同意也不反对abc只是在这浪费时间
<20-10,House>So you're not gonna say yes. You're notabcgonna say no. You're just gonna waste time.

408
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,800
<20-10,House>但病人的大脑或胰腺
<20-10,House>And the patient's brain,or pancreas,

409
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:51,720
<20-10,House>或者任何部位都不会abc等你给上司留个好印象之后再犯病
<20-10,House>or whatever is wrong with her is notabcgonna wait for you to impress your boss.

410
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:54,530
<20-10,House>所以 选一个--他的或者我的
<20-10,House>So pick one--eitherabchim or me.

411
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:57,620
<20-11,Cameron>做核磁共振
<20-11,Cameron>Do the mri.

412
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:13,140
<21-1,Wilson>你还没走?
<21-1,Wilson>You're still here?

413
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:15,710
<21-1,Wilson>把工作留给Cameron的唯一原因就是abc让你--
<21-1,Wilson>The whole point of giving cameronabcthe job was so that you could--

414
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,890
<21-1,Wilson>我不想回家
<21-1,Wilson>I don't want to go home.

415
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,770
<21-2,Cuddy>House说我应该把孩子还回去
<21-2,Cuddy>House told me I should give her back.

416
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:34,220
<21-2,Cuddy>我没有气愤abc反而开始思考他也许是对的
<21-2,Cuddy>Instead of being offended, I'veabcbeen wondering if he's right.

417
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:36,030
<21-3,Wilson>他不对
<21-3,Wilson>He's not.

418
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:40,840
<21-3,Wilson>凡是涉及私人 人性问题时 他从没对过
<21-3,Wilson>He never is, not when it's anythingabcpersonal, or human, or...

419
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:43,030
<21-4,Cuddy>不 他是一直很冷漠
<21-4,Cuddy>no, he's always cold.

420
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:47,000
<21-4,Cuddy>一直很混蛋 但他很少错
<21-4,Cuddy>He's always an ass, butabche's very rarely just wrong.

421
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:52,590
<21-4,Cuddy>我看了所有的条约和附款
<21-4,Cuddy>I've read every bonding andabcattachment book there is.

422
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,270
<21-4,Cuddy>我觉得自己在家 像在监狱
<21-4,Cuddy>I feel like I'm in prison at home.

423
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,480
<21-4,Cuddy>我觉得在这才是自由的
<21-4,Cuddy>I feel like I'm free here.

424
00:23:56,510 --> 00:24:00,230
<21-5,Wilson>为人父母就是做出牺牲
<21-5,Wilson>Parents make sacrifices.

425
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,260
<21-6,Cuddy>我不确定我是否想这样
<21-6,Cuddy>I don't know if I want to.

426
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:08,670
<21-6,Cuddy>我不为此感到自豪 我很难过
<21-6,Cuddy>I'm not proud of this. I feel terrible.

427
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,430
<21-6,Cuddy>感觉自己像个失败者
<21-6,Cuddy>I feel like a failure.

428
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:20,450
<21-6,Cuddy>但她理应被爱
<21-6,Cuddy>But she deserves to be loved.

429
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:25,550
<21-7,Wilson>我...我不知道该说什么
<21-7,Wilson>I-I... I don't know what to say.

430
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:32,370
<22-1,Foreman>左脑没有病灶
<22-1,Foreman>no plaques on the left hemisphere.

431
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:33,340
<22-2,Taub>右脑也没
<22-2,Taub>Or the right.

432
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:36,960
<22-3,Kutner>放大的海马区扫描图上 也没有
<22-3,Kutner>even magnified images ofabcher hippocampal region, nothing.

433
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:40,870
<22-4,House>令人震惊
<22-4,House>This is surprising.

434
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,100
<22-5,Kutner>我们能取消活检了?
<22-5,Kutner>So can we cancel the biopsy?

435
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:47,510
<22-6,House>去做逆行胰胆管造影
<22-6,House>Go ahead with the ercp.

436
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,570
<22-7,Foreman>我想跟你谈谈Remy的事
<22-7,Foreman>I need to talk to you about remy.

437
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:57,050
<22-9,Foreman>- 谁?abc- 13
<22-9,Foreman>- Who?abc- Thirteen.

438
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,380
<22-10,House>你刚叫她什么?
<22-10,House>What did you call her?

439
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:00,540
<22-11,Foreman>她是安慰剂组的
<22-11,Foreman>She's on placebo.

440
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,060
<22-12,House>而你想帮她换组
<22-12,House>And you want to change that.

441
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:09,130
<22-12,House>通常 我是最不应该被咨询道德问题的人
<22-12,House>I'm the last person you'd ever comeabcto for ethical advice, literally,

442
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:14,670
<22-12,House>也就是说你已经咨询过所有人abc但没人给了你想要的答案
<22-12,House>which means you've already asked every otherabcperson, and no one's given you the answer you want.

443
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:18,200
<22-13,Foreman>也可能是我尊重你的意见abc想听听你怎么看
<22-13,Foreman>Or I respect your opinion, and Iabcwant to hear what comes to your mind.

444
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:21,850
<22-14,House>她有找她的拉拉朋友和你一起上床吗?
<22-14,House>Has she invited any of herabclesbian friends into bed with you?

445
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,570
<22-15,Foreman>我就不该问
<22-15,Foreman>I was mistaken.

446
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,000
<22-16,House>药能治好她?
<22-16,House>Drug gonna cure her?

447
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,970
<22-17,Foreman>有希望 可以减轻症状
<22-17,Foreman>It looks promising,reducing symptoms.

448
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,020
<22-18,House>但治不好
<22-18,House>No cure then.

449
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:37,050
<22-18,House>所以观点是: 你也许能延缓一些症状abc给她多些时间 算三年吧
<22-18,House>So the pros are: You might delay the onset ofabcsymptoms, give her an extra year,maybe three.

450
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,680
<22-18,House>她也会在你45岁前死去
<22-18,House>She's still dead before you're 45.

451
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:44,490
<22-18,House>问题是 这多出的几年是否值得abc你冒险用医学生涯去换得?
<22-18,House>The question is,are those few years worthabcrisking the rest of your life in medicine?

452
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:49,840
<22-19,Foreman>不
<22-19,Foreman>No.

453
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:52,840
<22-20,House>看 并不难决定 不是吗?
<22-20,House>There, that wasn't so hard, was it?

454
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,870
<22-21,Foreman>谢谢
<22-21,Foreman>Thank you.

455
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,730
<22-22,House>不用谢
<22-22,House>You're welcome.

456
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,710
<22-22,House>除非你爱她
<22-22,House>Unless you love her.

457
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:09,300
<22-22,House>如果爱她 你会不顾一切
<22-22,House>If you love her, you do stupid things.

458
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,150
<23-1,Kutner>胆总管没问题
<23-1,Kutner>common bile ductis clear.

<23-3,Kutner>- Oh, god.abc- What?

461
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:25,190
<23-5,Kutner>是她的肺 House是对的
<23-5,Kutner>It's her lungs. House was right.

462
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,890
<23-5,Kutner>氧饱和度降到89
<23-5,Kutner>O-2 sat's down to 89.

463
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,700
<23-6,Taub>- 增到100%氧饱和abc- 快取出来
<23-6,Taub>- Increase to 100%abco-2. - Better get out.

464
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:38,250
<23-6,Taub>我们得告诉他吗?
<23-6,Taub>Do we have to tell him?

465
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:45,990
<24-1,Foreman>手术能去除胸腔积水
<24-1,Foreman>the surgeons were able toabcdrain the pleural effusions.

466
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:48,960
<24-1,Foreman>病人能自主呼吸 但依然很虚弱
<24-1,Foreman>The patient's breathing on herabcown, but she's still pretty weak.

467
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,130
<24-2,House>肺积水证明我们中的一个是正确的
<24-2,House>Lung failure proves thatabcone of us was right.

468
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:53,160
<24-2,House>谁指出大脑的?
<24-2,House>Who said brain?

469
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:57,840
<24-3,Kutner>是的 你预测到了肺衰竭abc但核磁共振显示她没有多发性硬化
<24-3,Kutner>Yes, you predicted that her lungs wouldabcfail, but the mri was negative for M.S.

470
00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:01,120
<24-4,House>我说对了在哪 没找出原因
<24-4,House>I was right about theabcwhere,but not the what.

471
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:07,090
<24-4,House>小核糖核酸病毒造成的局部脱髓鞘abc是核磁共振无法检测出的
<24-4,House>A picorna virus could cause localizedabcdemyelination that the mri wouldn't pick up.

472
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:12,450
<24-4,House>在她大脑表层做一个神经传导测试abc就能找到病点
<24-4,House>If we runa nerve-conduction study on theabcsurface of her brain we'll see the dead spots.

473
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,800
<24-5,Taub>你是说要开颅?
<24-5,Taub>Are you talking aboutabccutting into her skull?

474
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:18,890
<24-6,House>事实上 我说的是 取下脑壳 露出大脑
<24-6,House>Actually, I'm talking about cuttingabcoff her skull, exposing her brain.

475
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,530
<24-7,Kutner>也可能是胰腺肿瘤
<24-7,Kutner>A pancreatic tumor could still fit.

476
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,540
<24-7,Kutner>解释了心脏 血液和肺的问题
<24-7,Kutner>It explains the heart,theabcblood, and her lungs.

477
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:24,790
<24-8,Thirteen>逆行胰胆管造影排除了这种可能
<24-8,Thirteen>Ercp was negative.

478
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,680
<24-9,House>她同意我 是因为 她同意我abc对吧 亲爱的?
<24-9,House>And she agrees with me becauseabcshe agrees with me,right, sweetie?

479
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,360
<24-10,Kutner>我们只需再做几项灵敏度更高的测试
<24-10,Kutner>All we needis a more sensitive test.

480
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:32,340
<24-10,Kutner>内镜超声
<24-10,Kutner>Endoscopic ultrasound.

481
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:35,720
<24-11,House>还是承认吧 你已被证明是错的
<24-11,House>Just accept that you'veabcbeen proven wrong.

482
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,360
<24-12,Kutner>你也被证明是错的
<24-12,Kutner>You were also proven wrong.

483
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:39,090
<24-12,Kutner>为什么我不能有第二次测试的机会?
<24-12,Kutner>Why don't I get a second test?

484
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:43,650
<24-13,House>因为如果我是对的 问题出在大脑abc就没有时间纠缠于错误理论上
<24-13,House>Because if I'm right about the brain, thenabcwe don't have time to indulge your wrongness.

485
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:47,900
<24-14,Kutner>Cameron同意开颅时通知我
<24-14,Kutner>Let me know when cameron says yesabcto cutting off our patient's skull.

486
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,700
<24-14,Kutner>我先去做内镜超声了
<24-14,Kutner>I'll be doing the endoopic ultrasound.

487
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:54,730
<25-1,House>好消息
<25-1,House>Good news.

488
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:58,320
<25-1,House>我不是要你同意我去做一些abc未经允许的疯狂治疗
<25-1,House>I don't need your approval forabcsome crazy,unproven treatment.

489
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,820
<25-1,House>我需要一个测试
<25-1,House>I just need to do a test.

<25-3,House>Remind me to revoke kutner'sabctelephone privileges.

492
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:08,380
<25-4,Cameron>我不知道美国医学会还同意abc这样治疗多发性硬化啊
<25-4,Cameron>I didn't realize that was anabcA.M.A.-Approved treatment for M.S.

493
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:12,520
<25-5,House>不是多发性硬化abc而是它的起因--马脑炎
<25-5,House>Not searching for M.S.,But whatabcset it off-- equine encephalitis.

494
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:15,610

<25-10,Cameron>你要我同意你打开一个人的脑袋
<25-10,Cameron>You're asking me to let youabccut off the top of someone's head.

502
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:37,000
<25-10,Cameron>我需要比"等看到时我就知道了"abc更好的理由
<25-10,Cameron>I need more than,"I'llabcknow it when I see it."

503
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:39,850
<25-11,House>你是想要我在寻找证据前abc就提供证据?
<25-11,House>So you want proof before youabclet me go looking for the proof?

<27-6,Wilson>She'll ignore most ofabcit,but some of it'll stick.

532
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:45,550
<27-6,Wilson>在她经历这一切时 你都会在她的身边
<27-6,Wilson>You're gonna be there forabcher through all of that.

533
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:49,230

00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,320
<28-7,House>这些是用来当作证据的
<28-7,House>That's what used to pass for evidence.

<28-9,House>我不能找到你想要的证据abc因为深藏在她的脑袋里
<28-9,House>I can't find you the proof you wantabcbecause it's trapped inside her head.

551
00:31:58,010 --> 00:32:00,630
<28-9,House>唯一的办法 是开颅观察
<28-9,House>And the only way I can get at itabcis to cut it open and rip it out,

552
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,500
<28-9,House>显然你又不批准这做法
<28-9,House>which is apparently the oneabctest you won't let me run.

553
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,650
<28-9,House>所以做这个 要么什么也做不了

564
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:52,730
<29-6,House>我跳过手续abc是因为病人正冲着死亡超速前进
<29-6,House>I'm skipping steps because our patientabcis skipping steps on the way to being dead.

00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,710
<34-7,Cuddy>我知道这不合情理 但是真的
<34-7,Cuddy>I know it doesn't make anyabcsense, but it was real.

657
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,040
<34-7,Cuddy>确实发生了
<34-7,Cuddy>It was there.

658
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:12,590
<34-7,Cuddy>想抱抱她吗? 来 说"嗨"
<34-7,Cuddy>You want to hold her?abcCome up here. Come say hi.

659
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:16,090
<34-8,House>你认为我们也会来电?
<34-8,House>You think we'll bond?

660
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:29,360
<34-9,House>- 这很乖吗?abc- 有点
<34-9,House>- Is that cute?abc- A little.

661
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:33,160
<34-11,House>如果我对着你吐 你会发火
<34-11,House>If I threw up on you,you'd be pissed.

662
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:36,090
<34-12,Cuddy>你吐得不可爱
<34-12,Cuddy>Your puke isn't as cute.

663
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:38,300
<34-13,House>这由你的屁股决定
<34-13,House>That's 'cause of your hips.

664
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:43,390
<34-13,House>如果再怀久一点 她的胃括约肌会充分成熟
<34-13,House>If she would've just gestated a little longer,abcher stomach sphincter would be fully mature.

665
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:48,280
<34-13,House>但当我们直立行走abc怀足时婴儿头对妈咪的屁股来说就太大了
<34-13,House>But, no, we have to walk upright, which meansabcthat baby's head is too big for mommy's hips.

666
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:52,190
<34-13,House>顺便 你的屁股是进化的恩赐
<34-13,House>And by the way, your hips mayabcbe an evolutionary improvement.

667
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,590
<34-13,House>所以觉得孩子呕吐很可爱也是进化的结果
<34-13,House>So we've evolved to find baby puke cute,

668
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:59,520
<34-13,House>否则我们会在婴孩成熟前杀了他们
<34-13,House>'cause otherwise we'd kill themabcall before they became functional.

669
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:08,550
<34-13,House>交流到此结束
<34-13,House>Bonding's over.

670
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:11,110
<34-13,House>我要去看另一个孩子
<34-13,House>I got to go see another baby.

671
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:17,630
<35-1,Sarah>那我以后得没有脾脏活着?
<35-1,Sarah>So I can just lives pleen-free?

672
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,700
<35-2,Kutner>许多人都能生活得很好--
<35-2,Kutner>Plenty of people live perfectlyabcnormal lives without--

673
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,620
<35-3,House>脾脏没问题
<35-3,House>spleen's fine.

674
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:23,020
<35-4,Kutner>不是大脑问题
<35-4,Kutner>It's not her brain.

675
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:24,460
<35-5,House>当然是大脑
<35-5,House>Of course it's her brain.

676
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:27,780
<35-6,Kutner>你看过她的大脑 打开颅骨也没找到问题
<35-6,Kutner>You looked at her brain. You tookabcoff her skull. You found nothing.

677
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:30,780
<35-7,House>没看对地方
<35-7,House>Didn't look in the right part.

678
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:34,300
<35-7,House>没看到心脏那部份
<35-7,House>Didn't look in the heart part.

679
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:40,570
<35-7,House>在子宫里 血液不会流经肺部abc肺部还不起作用
<35-7,House>In the womb, blood has to bypass theabclungs, since they don't work yet.

680
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:47,300
<35-7,House>出生时 第一口气会使肺张开 动脉导管闭合
<35-7,House>When we're born,we take our first bigabcbreath, lungs expand,and the ductus closes.

681
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:49,760
<35-7,House>你的没有
<35-7,House>Yours didn't.

682
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:54,250
<35-8,Kutner>她是先天动脉导管未闭症
<35-8,Kutner>She has a patent ductus arteriosis.

683
00:39:54,270 --> 00:40:00,170
<35-9,House>当你感到压力 血压上升致使导管开放
<35-9,House>When you get stressed, your bloodabcpressure goes up and forces open the ductus.

684
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:05,890
<35-9,House>血液走了弯路 导致你鼻腔 胃部 肺部出血
<35-9,House>Blood takes a little detour, makes it leakabcfrom your nose,your stomach, your lungs,

685
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:11,570
<35-9,House>更值得一提的是 它会持续充盈你的右脑abc而左脑则供血不足
<35-9,House>and, more significantly,keeps it flowing to theabcright side of your brain and away from your left.

686
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:16,950
<35-9,House>意思就是 当你有压力时 你反而感觉不到
<35-9,House>Which means that when youabcget stressed, you get unstressed.

687
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:20,000
<35-9,House>这就是为什么你对吵闹的孩子特别有耐心
<35-9,House>That's why you're soabcgood with those annoying kids.

688
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:22,860
<35-9,House>也是当你血压下降
<35-9,House>And why, when your bloodabcpressure dropped,

689
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,620
<35-9,House>发现Cuddy那么惹人厌的原因
<35-9,House>you were able to identifyabccuddy as an annoying human being.

690
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:31,480
<35-9,House>好消息是 我们能修补心脏
<35-9,House>Good news is, we can fix the heart.

691
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:35,710
<35-9,House>对烦人的小孩来说就是坏消息
<35-9,House>Bad news for the annoying kids.

692
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:43,200
<36-1,Cameron>她真是不可思议
<36-1,Cameron>she's incredible.

693
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:45,220
<36-1,Cameron>谢谢
<36-1,Cameron>Thank you.

694
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,920
<36-2,Cuddy>今天干得很好
<36-2,Cuddy>Great work today.

695
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:51,870
<36-2,Cuddy>我应该相信你的直觉 以后我会
<36-2,Cuddy>I should've trusted yourabcinstincts. I will in the future.

696
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:56,140
<36-3,Cameron>我退出
<36-3,Cameron>I quit.

697
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:01,280
<36-4,Cuddy>我想我刚道歉了 如果你想 我可以跪下
<36-4,Cuddy>I think I just apologized. If youabcwant,I can get down on my knees.

698
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:02,970
<36-5,Cameron>这不是你的问题
<36-5,Cameron>It's not because of you.

699
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:08,440
<36-5,Cameron>我批准了一个疯狂的 没有任何证据的手术--
<36-5,Cameron>I approved an insane procedureabcwith no proof,no evidence, no--

700
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:10,690
<36-5,Cameron>你做得对
<36-5,Cameron>you made the right call.

701
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:13,160
<36-6,Cuddy>是大脑的问题
<36-6,Cuddy>The problem was a brain problem.

702
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:17,080
<36-6,Cuddy>没有手术 House不会发现左脑功能激化
<36-6,Cuddy>Without the procedure,house neverabcnotices the increased left-brain function.

703
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:18,730
<36-6,Cuddy>如果你没同意 她可能会死
<36-6,Cuddy>She'd be dead if you hadn't said yes.

704
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:21,260
<36-6,Cuddy>我知道 但...
<36-6,Cuddy>I know. But...

705
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:28,800
<36-7,Cameron>我总会对他说行 我在他手下学习过abc他深刻地影响着我
<36-7,Cameron>I'll always say yes to house. Iabcstudied under him. He's in my head.

706
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:33,300
<36-7,Cameron>如果你给别人这个工作 他们就会说不--
<36-7,Cameron>And if you gave anyone else this job,abcthey would always say no, because--

707
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:35,570
<36-7,Cameron>因为他们必须那样
<36-7,Cameron>well, because they should.

708
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:38,080
<36-7,Cameron>House是疯子
<36-7,Cameron>House is insane.

709
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:41,740
<36-8,Cuddy>又得我干了
<36-8,Cuddy>Which leaves me.

710
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:46,100
<36-9,Cameron>对不起
<36-9,Cameron>I'm sorry.

711
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:55,090
<37-1,Sarah>嗨 小家伙!
<37-1,Sarah>hey, buddy!

712
00:41:57,130 --> 00:41:59,230
<37-1,Sarah>没关系 伙计 过来
<37-1,Sarah>It's okay, buddy. Come here.

713
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:03,530
<37-1,Sarah>我好想你 我想你
<37-1,Sarah>Oh, I missed you so much. I missed you.
