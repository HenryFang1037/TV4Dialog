00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:04,770
<1-1,Wife>打扰一下  服务生
<1-1,Wife>Excuse me, waitress?

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,110
<1-2,Nadia>抱歉我们不再提供照烧鸡了
<1-2,Nadia>I'm afraid the teriyaki chicken's no longer on the menu.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,630
<1-3,Nadia>不好意思
<1-3,Nadia>Oh, I'm sorry.

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,010
<1-3,Nadia>你上次点的是那个
<1-3,Nadia>That's what you had last time.

5
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:13,660
<1-4,Wife>我们从没来过这
<1-4,Wife>We've never been here before.

6
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:14,830
<1-5,Nadia>我确实记得你
<1-5,Nadia>I definitely remember you.

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,090
<1-5,Nadia>不  我们从没来过北边
<1-5,Nadia>No, we never get up north.

8
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:17,030
<1-6,Nadia>我们只是来看一个
<1-6,Nadia>We're just up to see a friend of ours

9
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:19,360
<1-6,Nadia>去年搬到这里的朋友
<1-6,Nadia>who moved here last summer.

10
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:23,370
<1-6,Nadia>那时你头发颜色更浅  还带着圆框眼镜
<1-6,Nadia>Your hair was lighter. You had little round glasses.

11
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:24,300
<1-7,Henry>听上去像你
<1-7,Henry>Sounds like you.

12
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:25,460
<1-8,Wife>亨利  别听她的
<1-8,Wife>Henry, don't play along.

13
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,930
<1-8,Wife>她就是想骗点小费
<1-8,Wife>It's a gimmick, for tips.

14
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,860
<1-8,Wife>能给我们来杯水吗
<1-8,Wife>Could we get some water?

15
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,830
<1-9,Nadia>那是去年八月  十四号  星期六
<1-9,Nadia>It was last August. Saturday, the 14th.

16
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,660
<1-9,Nadia>你穿着蓝底白点的裙子
<1-9,Nadia>You were wearing a blue dress with polka dots.

17
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:36,640
<1-9,Nadia>眼睛红肿
<1-9,Nadia>Your eyes were puffy,

18
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,360
<1-9,Nadia>好像刚哭过
<1-9,Nadia>like you'd been crying.

19
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,880
<1-10,Henry>十四号是达伦的生日
<1-10,Henry>The 14th is Darren's birthday.

20
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:43,280
<1-10,Henry>他说他不得不取消生日聚会
<1-10,Henry>He said he had to cancel his party

21
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:45,180
<1-10,Henry>因为他的前女友来了
<1-10,Henry>'cause his old girlfriend showed up.

22
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:46,490
<1-10,Henry>他们大吵了一架
<1-10,Henry>They got into a huge fight.

23
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,360
<1-12,Henry>-亨利...  -我就知道  该死的
<1-12,Henry>- Henry... - I knew it. Damn it.

24
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:50,930
<1-12,Henry>从那次滑雪你俩无故消失时我就该知道的
<1-12,Henry>Ever since that ski trip when the two of you disappeared.

25
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:53,490
<1-13,Nadia>我这就去  给你们倒水
<1-13,Nadia>I'll go...get your water.

26
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:59,260
<1-14,Policeman>你还好吗
<1-14,Policeman>Are you all right?

27
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,750
<1-14,Policeman>你还好吗
<1-14,Policeman>Are you okay?

28
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,940
<1-15,Nadia>我的腿不能动了
<1-15,Nadia>I can't move my legs!

46
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,160
<2-1,House>想象一扇门
<2-1,House>Picture a door.

47
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:46,740
<2-1,House>用思维之钥将其打开
<2-1,House>Unlocked with the key of the mind.

48
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,390
<2-1,House>两个病例  都比上次那个有趣的多
<2-1,House>Two medical cases, both more fascinating than the last.

49
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:53,020
<2-2,Masters>这一点逻辑都没有
<2-2,Masters>That actually makes no logical sense.

50
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:55,360
<2-3,House>那扇门不通向逻辑之路
<2-3,House>This is not a door to logical sense.

51
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:57,620
<2-3,House>还有  闭嘴
<2-3,House>Also, shut up.

52
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:59,710
<2-3,House>一号病例
<2-3,House>Case number one.

53
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,640
<2-3,House>33岁  女性
<2-3,House>33-year-old woman

54
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,570
<2-3,House>名字是...
<2-3,House>Named...

55
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,980
<2-4,House>我忘了
<2-4,House>Something I can't remember.

56
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:07,020
<2-4,House>你们一会就会发现讽刺之处了
<2-4,House>You'll see the irony in a second.

57
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,920
<2-4,House>症状表现为暂时性瘫痪
<2-4,House>Presenting with temporary paralysis,

58
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,340
<2-4,House>肌酸激酶水平过高
<2-4,House>high CK levels,

59
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:14,160
<2-4,House>以及完美的记忆力
<2-4,House>and a perfect memory.

60
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:17,130
<2-5,Chase>多完美算完美
<2-5,Chase>How perfect is perfect?

61
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,560
<2-6,House>完美无缺
<2-6,House>Perfectly perfect.

62
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:19,850
<2-6,House>超忆症
<2-6,House>Hyperthymesia.

63
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:22,350
<2-6,House>她能回忆起自青春期以来的
<2-6,House>Complete recall of every moment of every day

64
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:23,550
<2-6,House>所有时刻
<2-6,House>since puberty.

65
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:27,590
<2-6,House>全部760049分钟
<2-6,House>All 7,600,049 of them.

66
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,510
<2-6,House>很酷  是吧
<2-6,House>It's cool, huh?

67
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,870
<2-6,House>这是为数不多的记录在案的超忆病例之一
<2-6,House>One of only a handful of recorded cases.

68
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,090
<2-7,Foreman>我们知道两个症状
<2-7,Foreman>So we have two symptoms:

69
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,270
<2-7,Foreman>暂时性腿部瘫痪以及肌酸激酶水平过高
<2-7,Foreman>Temporary leg paralysis and elevated CK.

70
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,520
<2-8,House>看来你不是来自她的"超强记忆力星球"
<2-8,House>Obviously you're not suffering from the same condition

71
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,020
<2-8,House>因为你已然忘了我激动人心的画外音了
<2-8,House>'cause you've already forgotten my dramatic voiceover.

72
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,050
<2-8,House>还有第三个症状
<2-8,House>There's a third symptom.

73
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:42,790
<2-9,Foreman>-她的记忆力与此无关  -为什么
<2-9,Foreman>- Her memory's unrelated. - Why?

74
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,480
<2-10,Masters>这种医学现象十分罕见
<2-10,Masters>It's a strange medical phenomenon--

75
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,700
<2-11,Foreman>超忆症一般在青春期显现
<2-11,Foreman>Hyperthymesia is known to manifest in adolescence.

76
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:49,080
<2-12,House>就记录在案的五个病例而言  没错
<2-12,House>Yeah, in the whole five documented cases.

77
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:49,720
<2-13,Foreman>如果有联系
<2-13,Foreman>To be related,

78
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,870
<2-13,Foreman>就意味着新的病症在二十年后才出现
<2-13,Foreman>it would mean 20 years between symptoms.

79
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,510
<2-13,Foreman>另外  我不知道什么病
<2-13,Foreman>Plus, I don't know of any diseases

80
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:54,610
<2-13,Foreman>会导致超强记忆力
<2-13,Foreman>that cause great memory.

81
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,380
<2-13,Foreman>只知道能破坏记忆的
<2-13,Foreman>Only ones that destroy it.

82
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,490
<2-13,Foreman>核磁共振显示没有中风或肿瘤的迹象
<2-13,Foreman>MRI showed no evidence of stroke or tumor,

83
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,950
<2-13,Foreman>可能是中毒
<2-13,Foreman>so probably a toxin.

84
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,950
<2-14,Taub>她是服务员
<2-14,Taub>She's a waitress.

85
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:03,160
<2-14,Taub>服务员容易食物中毒和酗酒成性
<2-14,Taub>They're no strangers to botulism or alcoholism.

86
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:05,200
<2-14,Taub>我们应该检查下那家餐馆和她家里
<2-14,Taub>We should search the diner and where she lives.

87
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:06,590
<2-15,House>或者你们可以在她的脑中搜索
<2-15,House>Or you could search her brain.

88
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,670
<2-15,House>那里可是她的记忆之家
<2-15,House>You know, where her memory lives.

89
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:09,890
<2-15,House>省点油吧
<2-15,House>Save the gas.

90
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,280
<2-15,House>你们俩去检查她家
<2-15,House>You two check her home.

91
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,090
<2-15,House>你们俩去把病人的完整病史问出来
<2-15,House>You two get a complete patient history.

92
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,190
<2-15,House>看谁会先找到答案
<2-15,House>We'll see who gets an answer first.

93
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,430
<2-16,Taub>你不是说还有第二个病例吗
<2-16,Taub>You said there's a second case?

94
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:19,670
<2-17,House>啊  对了
<2-17,House>Oh! Yeah.

95
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:22,550
<2-17,House>多谢提醒
<2-17,House>Thanks.

96
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,830
<2-18,House>患者是一名45岁的医生
<2-18,House>The case of the 45-year-old doctor

97
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:30,490
<2-18,House>他没能通过病理学再认证考试
<2-18,House>who just failed his pathology recertification exam

98
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,540
<2-18,House>即将失去专科医学会认证资格
<2-18,House>and is going to lose his board certification

99
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,520
<2-18,House>还会被开除
<2-18,House>and get fired.

100
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,580
<2-19,Foreman>你怎么会没通过
<2-19,Foreman>How'd you fail it?

101
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,730
<2-19,Foreman>你生活的一半时间都在实验室度过
<2-19,Foreman>You spend half your life in the lab.

102
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,690
<2-19,Foreman>我在流感恢复期
<2-19,Foreman>I was recovering from the flu.

103
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:39,660
<2-20,Taub>我下周会重考  没什么大不了的
<2-20,Taub>I'm retaking it next week. It's not an issue.

104
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,910
<2-21,House>一般来说  我会同意物竞天择适者生存
<2-21,House>Normally, I'd let darwinism run its course.

105
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,370
<2-21,House>但是  卡迪对她的海报男孩
<2-21,House>But Cuddy's in a big tizzy

106
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,440
<2-21,House>快要被炒了的事紧张不已
<2-21,House>about her poster boy getting canned.

107
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,850
<2-21,House>那我们怎样才能让小矮个全力以赴呢
<2-21,House>So how are we gonna get the short guy off the short bus?

108
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,520
<2-23,Taub>-找个家教怎么样  -我不需要家教
<2-23,Taub>- What about a tutor? - I don't need a tutor.

109
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,800
<2-23,Taub>那就请家教吧
<2-23,Taub>Tutor it is.

110
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:52,820
<2-24,House>自选一味良药吧
<2-24,House>Choose your poison.

111
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:55,400
<2-24,House>如果你想畅饮澳洲啤酒
<2-24,House>Chase, if you prefer pounding Aussie beers

112
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,800
<2-24,House>并一起感慨悲剧的离婚生活的话  选奇斯
<2-24,House>and commiserating over the suckiness of divorce.

113
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,060
<2-24,House>如果你想了解精神能量  闪卡
<2-24,House>Masters, if you want nervous energy,

114
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:03,730
<2-24,House>以及各种可憎晦涩的知识竞赛  就选马斯特斯
<2-24,House>flash cards and obnoxious pieces of arcane Trivia.

115
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:05,280
<2-24,House>如果你需要被毫无幽默感的
<2-24,House>Foreman, if you need to be berated

116
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,560
<2-24,House>凶神恶煞训斥  就是福曼了
<2-24,House>by a humorless hard-ass.

117
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:09,130
<2-25,Taub>福曼吧
<2-25,Taub>Foreman.

118
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:10,960
<2-26,House>有意思
<2-26,House>Interesting.

119
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:13,460
<2-26,House>你心里肯定比看上去更焦虑不堪
<2-26,House>You must be more worried than you look.

120
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:20,070
<3-1,House>我需要会诊  威尔森医生

138
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,530
<3-11,House>威尔森的朋友
<3-11,House>Wilson's friend.

139
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,010
<3-12,Cuddy>我电脑瘫痪了
<3-12,Cuddy>My computer crashed.

140
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,360
<3-12,Cuddy>关于他熟人的资料全都没了
<3-12,Cuddy>Lost my database of his acquaintances.

141
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:05,170
<3-13,House>或者你们俩都在骗我
<3-13,House>Or you're both lying to me.

142
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:08,510
<3-14,Cuddy>我完全不知威尔森有个叫莎拉的朋友
<3-14,Cuddy>I know nothing about Wilson having a friend named Sarah.

143
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:10,460
<3-14,Cuddy>满意了吗
<3-14,Cuddy>Satisfied?

144
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:15,200
<3-15,House>当然不
<3-15,House>Nooo.

145
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:18,430
<4-1,Foreman>呕吐物的八种类型是什么
<4-1,Foreman>What are the eight types of vomitus?

146
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,890
<4-2,Taub>如果你再问我一道复习题
<4-2,Taub>I could show you four right now

147
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,090
<4-2,Taub>我立刻吐其中四种给你看
<4-2,Taub>if you ask me one more review question.

148
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:23,130
<4-3,Foreman>是你选的我
<4-3,Foreman>Hey, you picked me.

149
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:24,460
<4-3,Foreman>你说你想要凶神恶煞的
<4-3,Foreman>You said you wanted a hard-ass.

150
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,260
<4-4,Taub>不  那是豪斯说的
<4-4,Taub>No, House said that.

151
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:28,140
<4-4,Taub>我假装同意省得他再跟我啰嗦
<4-4,Taub>I pretended to agree to get him off my back.

152
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,990
<4-4,Taub>我选你是因为
<4-4,Taub>I picked you because I wanted the guy

153
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,450
<4-4,Taub>我想要那种
<4-4,Taub>who doesn't like getting involved

154
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,910
<4-4,Taub>不会多管闲事的人
<4-4,Taub>in other people's problems.

155
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:34,090
<4-5,Foreman>我是这样没错  但我以为是你不想遭受
<4-5,Foreman>Yes, I thought you'd want to skip

156
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,720
<4-5,Foreman>因被炒而带来的巨大耻辱才选的我
<4-5,Foreman>the massive public humiliation of getting fired.

157
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,200
<4-6,Taub>所以你就把我当傻瓜看待吗
<4-6,Taub>By treating me like I'm an imbecile?

158
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:39,730
<4-6,Taub>我没问题的
<4-6,Taub>I'm totally fine.

159
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:41,950
<4-6,Taub>我第一次病理学认证考了A
<4-6,Taub>I aced my first pathology boards.

160
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:45,780
<4-7,Foreman>过去几百年医学可是有了长足的进步
<4-7,Foreman>Medicine has come a long way in the last hundred years.

161
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:47,270
<4-7,Foreman>你知道...
<4-7,Foreman>You know...

162
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,530
<4-8,Taub>我听说有个人
<4-8,Taub>I heard of a guy

163
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:49,950
<4-8,Taub>认识一个
<4-8,Taub>who knew a guy

164
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:54,710
<4-8,Taub>能提前拿到考题的人
<4-8,Taub>who could get the exam ahead of time.

165
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:55,650
<4-8,Taub>我是这么听说的
<4-8,Taub>It was something I heard.

166
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:56,570
<4-9,Foreman>病历上说
<4-9,Foreman>Patient's file

167
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:58,410
<4-9,Foreman>她根据新的减肥食谱减了些体重  对吧
<4-9,Foreman>said she lost some weight on a new diet, right?

168
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,090
<4-10,Taub>没错  她改吃素了
<4-10,Taub>Yeah, she went vegan.

169
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:02,550
<4-11,Foreman>泻药也算素食吗
<4-11,Foreman>Are laxatives vegan?

170
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,190
<5-1,House>怎么了
<5-1,House>Hello?

171
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,000
<5-2,Foreman>你在哪
<5-2,Foreman>Where are you?

172
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:09,360
<5-3,House>在停车场里
<5-3,House>In the parking garage,

173
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,280
<5-3,House>搜查威尔森的车
<5-3,House>searching Wilson's car.

174
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,670
<5-4,Taub>我们有答案了  镁中毒
<5-4,Taub>We have an answer. Magnesium poisoning.

175
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,960
<5-5,Foreman>我们发现了大量的泻药
<5-5,Foreman>We found a pretty large stash of laxatives.

176
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:17,750
<5-5,Foreman>滥用可能导致高镁血症
<5-5,Foreman>Abuse can lead to hypermagnesemia.

177
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,900
<5-6,House>我承认这真是...
<5-6,House>I admit that's...

178
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:22,860
<5-6,House>令人震惊的奇思妙想啊
<5-6,House>Impressively outside-the-box thinking.

179
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,880
<5-7,Foreman>豪斯
<5-7,Foreman>House.

180
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,340
<5-7,Foreman>你还在吗  豪斯
<5-7,Foreman>You still there, House?

181
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,140
<5-8,Taub>一切正常吗
<5-8,Taub>Everything okay?

182
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:39,000
<5-8,Taub>不
<5-8,Taub>No.

183
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:40,940
<5-9,House>刚刚的一瞬间  我以为威尔森
<5-9,House>For a second, I thought Wilson

184
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:42,970
<5-9,House>可能滥用药物
<5-9,House>might have a drug problem.

185
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,900
<5-9,House>但事实比这糟糕太多了
<5-9,House>Turns out it's much, much worse.

186
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,680
<5-10,Taub>好吧  我们给她输液
<5-10,Taub>Okay...uh, so we push fluids

187
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:51,560
<5-10,Taub>然后等她的肾滤出高镁吗
<5-10,Taub>and wait for her kidneys to clear the hypermagnesemia?

188
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,140
<5-11,House>那得等到天荒地老了  因为根本就不是
<5-11,House>You'll be waiting a long time since that's not what she has.

189
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,270
<5-11,House>她的血压和呼吸频率都正常
<5-11,House>Her BP and respiratory rate are normal.

190
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,250
<5-11,House>你们俩忙着
<5-11,House>While you two were so busy

191
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,220
<5-11,House>开动脑筋的同时
<5-11,House>being impressively outside the box,

192
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:02,150
<5-11,House>却忽略了真实情况
<5-11,House>you missed the actual box.

193
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,580
<5-11,House>奇斯和马斯特斯有结果了吗
<5-11,House>Chase and Masters done yet?

194
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:07,360
<6-1,Nadia>11月16号  我喝了两瓶清啤
<6-1,Nadia>Two light beers, November 16th.

195
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:10,510
<6-1,Nadia>17号  相当大一杯葡萄酒
<6-1,Nadia>One really bad glass of Pinot on the 17th.

196
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,040
<6-1,Nadia>18号以后没再喝酒
<6-1,Nadia>Uh, nothing from the 18th.

197
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,450
<6-2,Masters>你不该去美航局这样的地方工作吗
<6-2,Masters>Shouldn't you be working for NASA or something?

198
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,330
<6-3,Nadia>你是说为什么我只是个服务员吗
<6-3,Nadia>You mean why am I just a waitress?

199
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,740
<6-4,Masters>不  我不是说...
<6-4,Masters>No, I didn't mean...

200
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,270
<6-4,Masters>对不起  我...
<6-4,Masters>I'm sorry, I-I-I-I...

201
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,870
<6-4,Masters>没关系
<6-4,Masters>It's okay.

202
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:24,980
<6-5,Nadia>能记住并不意味着
<6-5,Nadia>Remembering something is not the same

203
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,310
<6-5,Nadia>我就能理解
<6-5,Nadia>as understanding it.

204
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,950
<6-5,Nadia>我不是天才
<6-5,Nadia>I'm not a genius.

205
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:30,560
<6-5,Nadia>我热爱我的工作  我干得很好
<6-5,Nadia>I love my job. I'm great at it.

206
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:33,210
<6-5,Nadia>能让我的脑子忙不停歇
<6-5,Nadia>Keeps my mind busy.

207
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:37,190
<6-6,House>你好  我是豪斯医生

<6-6,House>You are not pooping.

209
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:44,830
<6-6,House>我的问题是  你也是个笨手笨脚的人吗
<6-6,House>Question is, are you also a klutz?

210
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:48,760
<6-7,Nadia>这个  我猜我和大多数人差不多
<6-7,Nadia>Uh... I guess I'm no clumsier than most people.

211
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:49,970
<6-8,House>你为什么要猜呢
<6-8,House>What are you guessing for?

212
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:50,820
<6-8,House>你过目不忘
<6-8,House>You've got a perfect memory.

<6-8,House>我听说你能记住数字  日期  行为数据
<6-8,House>I was told there'd be numbers, dates, fireworks.

214
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:55,990
<6-9,Nadia>你想知道什么
<6-9,Nadia>What do you want to know?

<6-16,Chase>That's a big spike in discoordination.

225
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:25,670
<6-17,House>如果再加上便秘的话就是早期帕金森症了
<6-17,House>If you add the constipation, it's early onset Parkinson's.

226
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:28,940
<6-17,House>给她做全套神经测试  开始用左旋多巴
<6-17,House>Give her a full neuro exam, and start her on levodopa.

227
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,510
<7-1,Wilson>你未经允许就闯进我家
<7-1,Wilson>Oh, I'm so surprised you broke into my apartment

228
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,450
<7-1,Wilson>我好意外啊

234
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:50,020
<7-3,Wilson>那盒子里装的最好别是我想的那样
<7-3,Wilson>That had better not be what I think it is.

235
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,540
<7-4,House>如果你是指你的新瘾君子女友  没错
<7-4,House>If you mean your new junkie girlfriend, then yes.

236
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,830
<7-5,Wilson>豪斯
<7-5,Wilson>House...

237
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:58,420
<7-6,Wilson>好吧  我交代  我养了只猫
<7-6,Wilson>Okay, fine. I got a cat.

238
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,720
<7-6,Wilson>谜底揭晓了
<7-6,Wilson>Release the kraken.

239
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,250
<7-7,House>我觉得你没有意识到问题的严重性
<7-7,House>I don't think you appreciate the severity of your situation.

240
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,720
<7-7,House>你正迅速接近
<7-7,House>You are rapidly approaching

241
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,990
<7-7,House>男性独身主义病的末期
<7-7,House>an end-stage male spinsterism.

242
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:07,640
<7-8,House>那只猫
<7-8,House>That cat,

243
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,180
<7-8,House>那只你负责注射胰岛素
<7-8,House>that diabetic cat that you're shooting up with insulin

244
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,980
<7-8,House>并喂食猫薄荷的糖尿病猫
<7-8,House>and buying dime bags of catnip for,

245
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:15,400
<7-8,House>意味着你彻底放弃寻找新对象了
<7-8,House>that means you've given up on ever finding anyone.

246
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,860
<7-9,Wilson>你不觉得你在大惊小怪吗
<7-9,Wilson>Don't you think you're completely overreacting

247
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:20,390
<7-10,House>如果是我大惊小怪  你干嘛骗我呢
<7-10,House>If I'm completely overreacting, why'd you lie to me?

248
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:23,260
<7-11,Wilson>因为我就知道你会大惊小怪
<7-11,Wilson>Um, because I knew you would completely overreact.

249
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:25,230
<7-12,House>你给它起名叫莎拉
<7-12,House>Its name's Sarah.

250
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:26,920
<7-12,House>这不是猫的名字  是女人的名字
<7-12,House>Cats aren't named that. Women are.

251
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,400
<7-12,House>搞什么飞机
<7-12,House>What the freud is that about?

252
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:30,490
<7-13,Wilson>听着  不是我给她起的名字
<7-13,Wilson>Look, I didn't name her.

253
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,510
<7-13,Wilson>我邻居起的
<7-13,Wilson>My neighbor did.

254
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:33,720
<7-13,Wilson>她死了  我很难过
<7-13,Wilson>She died, and I felt bad.

255
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,610
<7-13,Wilson>要是她被收养所接去就完了
<7-13,Wilson>Sarah would have been destroyed at the shelter.

256
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,300
<7-14,House>如果你不一天回家两次给它打针
<7-14,House>Aww, who would want a cat that croaks

257
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:39,460
<7-14,House>这只猫就会把嗓子嚎哑
<7-14,House>if you're not home twice a day

258
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:41,220
<7-14,House>这样的猫谁要啊
<7-14,House>to shoot it up?

259
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,910
<7-14,House>简直就是活生生的《迷失》[知名美剧]
<7-14,House>It's like having your own button on Lost.

260
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:46,300
<7-14,House>我很确定
<7-14,House>You know, I'm pretty sure

261
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,240
<7-14,House>附近有条河[话外音  可以淹死猫]
<7-14,House>that there is a river nearby.

262
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,400
<7-15,Wilson>我要养她
<7-15,Wilson>I'm keeping her.

263
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:57,130
<8-1,Masters>耸肩
<8-1,Masters>Okay, shrug your shoulders

264
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:00,200
<8-1,Masters>保持住
<8-1,Masters>and don't let me push them down.

265
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,610
<8-1,Masters>我忍不住想问
<8-1,Masters>So I have to ask, uh...

266
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:04,180
<8-1,Masters>你有什么诀窍吗
<8-1,Masters>Is there a trick you use?

267
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:05,480
<8-1,Masters>比如助记符号
<8-1,Masters>Mnemonics?

268
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,640
<8-1,Masters>比如冥想
<8-1,Masters>Meditation?

269
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,640
<8-2,Nadia>不  没有诀窍
<8-2,Nadia>No, no tricks.

270
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,580
<8-2,Nadia>我毫不费力  真的  能力摆在那
<8-2,Nadia>I don't even try, really. It's just there.

271
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:15,720
<8-2,Nadia>我的记忆会因为
<8-2,Nadia>Is my memory gonna go away...

272
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:16,680
<8-2,Nadia>帕金森氏症而丢失吗
<8-2,Nadia>with the Parkinson's?

273
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:17,940
<8-3,Foreman>很有可能
<8-3,Foreman>It's quite possible.

274
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,200
<8-3,Foreman>但在作出最终诊断前
<8-3,Foreman>But we still have a lot of tests to do

275
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:20,980
<8-3,Foreman>我们还得做很多检查
<8-3,Foreman>before we have a definitive diagnosis.

276
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:25,030
<8-4,Nadia>也有可能是癌症
<8-4,Nadia>Well, here's hoping for cancer.

277
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,180
<8-4,Nadia>娜迪娅
<8-4,Nadia>Nadia?

278
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,510
<8-5,Elena>你老板给我打过电话
<8-5,Elena>Your boss called me.

279
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,410
<8-5,Elena>打扰了
<8-5,Elena>Sorry, um...

280
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:35,010
<8-5,Elena>我是艾琳娜  娜迪娅的姐姐
<8-5,Elena>I'm Elena, Nadia's older sister.

281
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,790
<8-6,Nadia>你没必要来这
<8-6,Nadia>You don't have to be here.

282
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:40,010
<8-7,Elena>我愿意相信  如果我病了
<8-7,Elena>But I'd like to pretend you'd visit me

283
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,520
<8-7,Elena>你也会来医院看我的
<8-7,Elena>if I were in the hospital.

284
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:44,890
<8-8,Nadia>你带了雏菊来
<8-8,Nadia>You brought daisies.

285
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:47,580
<8-9,Elena>你最喜欢雏菊花了
<8-9,Elena>They're your favorite.

286
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,930
<8-10,Nadia>不  我最讨厌了
<8-10,Nadia>No, they're my least favorite.

287
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:54,780
<8-10,Nadia>我的脸曾六次被它刺伤
<8-10,Nadia>I was stung in the face six times by--

288
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,030
<8-10,Nadia>天啊
<8-10,Nadia>Oh, god.

289
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,430
<8-11,Elena>怎么了
<8-11,Elena>What's wrong?

290
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,590
<8-12,Nadia>我的心脏
<8-12,Nadia>My heart.

291
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,760
<8-13,Foreman>心跳加快  宽波复杂性心动过速
<8-13,Foreman>Fast, wide-complex rhythm.

292
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,650
<8-13,Foreman>拿除颤器
<8-13,Foreman>Get the paddles.

293
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,370
<9-1,Chase>心脏问题排除了帕金森氏症
<9-1,Chase>Cardiac involvement rules out Parkinson's.

294
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:07,960
<9-2,Foreman>回到短期麻痹
<9-2,Foreman>We're back to transient paralysis

295
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,480
<9-2,Foreman>高肌酸激酶  再加上心律不齐
<9-2,Foreman>and high CK, plus arrhythmia.

296
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:10,620
<9-3,House>马斯特斯  当你最终
<9-3,House>Masters, when you finally

297
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:12,770
<9-3,House>出落成女人时
<9-3,House>blossom into a woman,

298
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,350
<9-3,House>会睡一个养猫的男人吗
<9-3,House>would you ever sleep with a man who had a cat?

299
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:16,240
<9-4,Masters>当然
<9-4,Masters>Sure.

300
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:19,190
<9-5,House>错  答案是不会
<9-5,House>Wrong, the answer is no.

301
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,370
<9-5,House>小邋遢
<9-5,House>Slut.

302
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:23,590
<9-5,House>你们养过猫吗
<9-5,House>Any of you ever had a cat?

303
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,550
<9-5,House>那你们做过爱吗
<9-5,House>Any of you ever had sex?

304
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,500
<9-5,House>我想  这就是你们书呆子常说的
<9-5,House>I think, as your people say,

305
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,940
<9-5,House>证明完毕
<9-5,House>quod erat demonstrandum.

306
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,500
<9-6,Chase>儿茶酚胺过量会导致心律不齐
<9-6,Chase>An excess of catecholamine could set off an arrhythmia.

307
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:34,200
<9-7,Foreman>不是嗜铬细胞瘤  她的血压很正常
<9-7,Foreman>It's not a pheo. Her blood pressure's fine.

308
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,290
<9-8,Masters>很可能我们落下了明显症状
<9-8,Masters>Maybe we're missing the obvious.

309
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,820
<9-8,Masters>心脏问题可能是由多种原因引起的
<9-8,Masters>The heart could be behind everything.

310
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,700
<9-8,Masters>如果心脏不能有效泵血
<9-8,Masters>If it's not pumping effectively,

311
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,440
<9-8,Masters>肌肉会丧失功能
<9-8,Masters>the muscles shut down.

312
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,780
<9-8,Masters>肌酸激酶浓度升高  协调能力下降
<9-8,Masters>CK elevates, coordination suffers.

313
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:45,210
<9-8,Masters>你为什么要问猫的事
<9-8,Masters>Why are you asking about cats?

314
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,360
<9-9,House>好奇嘛
<9-9,House>Curiosity.

315
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,690
<9-9,House>我们能专心点吗
<9-9,House>Can we focus here?

316
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,870
<9-10,Masters>她的心脏问题
<9-10,Masters>Uh, her heart problems

317
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,610
<9-10,Masters>是在娜迪娅见到她姐姐时出现的
<9-10,Masters>started when Nadia saw her sister.

318
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:54,130
<9-10,Masters>紧张导致心率不齐
<9-10,Masters>Stress-induced arrhythmia

319
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:57,190
<9-10,Masters>可能是因长QT综合症而起
<9-10,Masters>could be caused by long QT syndrome.

321
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,130
<9-11,Taub>她姐姐进屋不过五分钟
<9-11,Taub>Her sister was barely in the room five minutes.

324
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,420
<9-12,Masters>她说她们已经六年不见了
<9-12,Masters>She said they'd been estranged for over six years.

325
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,300
<9-12,Masters>关系够紧张的
<9-12,Masters>That's a lot of tension.

326
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:04,580
<9-13,House>做个压力测试确认是否有长QT综合症
<9-13,House>Run a stress test to confirm long QT.

327
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,970
<9-14,Chase>这需要药物诱发
<9-14,Chase>It'll have to be drug-induced.

328
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:07,370
<9-14,Chase>跑步机会使她的缝针撕裂的
<9-14,Chase>Treadmill will pull her stitches.

329
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,350
<9-15,House>药物从来不是最好的解决方法
<9-15,House>Drugs are never the answer.

330
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,690
<9-15,House>如果我们想让她心脏发狂
<9-15,House>If we want her heart to go crazy,

331
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,580
<9-15,House>有更简单  安全的办法
<9-15,House>There's something simpler and safer.

332
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:16,120
<9-15,House>她姐姐
<9-15,House>Use the sister.

333
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,940
<10-1,House>你对我说谎
<10-1,House>You lied to me.

334
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,390
<10-2,Cuddy>没有  我说我不知道威尔森
<10-2,Cuddy>No. I said I didn't know anything about Wilson

335
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:29,340
<10-2,Cuddy>有个叫莎拉的朋友
<10-2,Cuddy>having a friend named Sarah.

336
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:33,380
<10-2,Cuddy>在豪斯的规则里  这不算撒谎
<10-2,Cuddy>Under House rules, that is not a lie.

337
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:34,710
<10-2,Cuddy>他很孤单
<10-2,Cuddy>He's lonely.

338
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,710
<10-2,Cuddy>猫能让他的感情有所寄托
<10-2,Cuddy>That cat is a nice way for him to get some affection.

339
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:37,940
<10-3,House>这么一只普通的猫
<10-3,House>That's not the kind of putty tat

340
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:39,250
<10-3,House>可不能让他得到慰藉
<10-3,House>he needs to be getting it from.

341
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,830
<10-3,House>他需要的是女人
<10-3,House>He needs a putty tat he can tap.

342
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:43,620
<10-4,Cuddy>为什么这事对你来说这么重要
<10-4,Cuddy>Why is it so important to you?

343
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:45,330
<10-5,House>在第二次离婚后
<10-5,House>After divorce number two,

344
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:47,050
<10-5,House>他不可遏制地坠入
<10-5,House>he fell into a committed relationship

345
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,770
<10-5,House>和一只三脚暹罗猫的爱河中
<10-5,House>with a three-legged siamese.

346
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,110
<10-5,House>不接电话
<10-5,House>He stopped answering his phone,

347
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:52,320
<10-5,House>重新把家装修的像个灰色花园
<10-5,House>redecorated his place like Grey Gardens.

349
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:53,690
<10-5,House>他不能回到正常的人类社会
<10-5,House>He wasn't able to come back to humanity

350
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:54,720
<10-5,House>除非为他留一扇
<10-5,House>until a window was left

351
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,520
<10-5,House>充满悬念通往冒险的大门
<10-5,House>suspiciously and heroically open.

352
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,940
<10-5,House>一只猫怎么能打开这扇窗户  我不知道
<10-5,House>How that cat opened the window, I will never know.

353
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:04,110
<10-6,Cuddy>他只是需要些时间
<10-6,Cuddy>He just needs more time.

354
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:08,660
<10-6,Cuddy>别去烦他和他的猫了
<10-6,Cuddy>Leave him and the cat alone.

355
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:13,460
<10-7,House>你插手我就撤退
<10-7,House>I won't if you will.

356
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:15,020
<11-1,Elena>抱歉我带了雏菊来
<11-1,Elena>Sorry about the daisies.

357
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,210
<11-1,Elena>我总搞不清楚你究竟喜不喜欢
<11-1,Elena>I always get it confused if you love or hate them.

358
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:18,500
<11-2,Nadia>你想知道我告诉你我讨厌雏菊
<11-2,Nadia>Do you want to know exactly how many times

359
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:19,940
<11-2,Nadia>到底有多少次了吗
<11-2,Nadia>I've told you that I hate them?

360
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:23,200
<11-3,Elena>我不是有意的
<11-3,Elena>I didn't do it on purpose.

361
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,570
<11-4,Chase>她的心跳没有加快
<11-4,Chase>Her heart rate isn't moving.

362
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:28,660
<11-4,Chase>她姐姐的刺激点火候不够
<11-4,Chase>The sister stress pot needs stirring.

363
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,380
<11-5,Masters>你想让我挑起争端吗
<11-5,Masters>You want me to start a fight?

364
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:32,410
<11-5,Masters>不
<11-5,Masters>No.

365
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,530
<11-6,Chase>小煽呼一下
<11-6,Chase>Just agitate a little,

366
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:35,050
<11-6,Chase>提些陈年往事
<11-6,Chase>use something from the history.

367
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:36,050
<11-6,Chase>你又不是去骗她们
<11-6,Chase>You're not lying to them.

368
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:37,130
<11-6,Chase>事实上  你既告诉了她们事实
<11-6,Chase>In fact, you'd be telling the truth,

369
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:40,260
<11-6,Chase>又为她们提供了医学需要的服务
<11-6,Chase>and serving their medical needs.

370
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:52,910
<11-7,Masters>你们俩有一阵子没见了  是吧
<11-7,Masters>You haven't seen each other in a while, huh?

371
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:56,710
<11-7,Masters>我听说你倒车撞娜迪娅的事了
<11-7,Masters>I heard the story about the time you hit Nadia with the car.

372
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:00,250
<11-7,Masters>一定很可怕吧
<11-7,Masters>It must have been pretty scary.

373
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:01,860
<11-8,Elena>你为什么要对他们说这事
<11-8,Elena>Why would you tell them that?

374
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,010
<11-9,Nadia>他们问我骨折是怎么来的
<11-9,Nadia>They asked about broken bones.

375
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:05,290
<11-10,Elena>我发誓我看过后视镜了
<11-10,Elena>I swear that I checked my mirror.

376
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:07,140
<11-11,Nadia>你知道这是骗人的话
<11-11,Nadia>You know that's a lie.

377
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,660
<11-11,Nadia>你知道我在那取信
<11-11,Nadia>You knew I was getting the mail,

378
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,100
<11-11,Nadia>你根本不关心我  所以没看倒车镜
<11-11,Nadia>and you just didn't care enough to check!

379
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,260
<11-11,Nadia>正因如此  你还毁了我的23岁生日
<11-11,Nadia>Just like you didn't care that you ruined my 23rd birthday!

380
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:15,260
<11-12,Elena>娜迪娅  你又来了

00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,200
<12-5,Foreman>我准备了一套模拟测试
<12-5,Foreman>I pulled a practice test.

395
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,110
<12-6,Taub>我讨厌模拟测试
<12-6,Taub>I hate practice tests.

401
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:01,040
<12-9,Foreman>是有这可能  因为你上回就没过
<12-9,Foreman>Maybe, because you did.

402
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,800
<12-10,Taub>那是因为我在感冒恢复期
<12-10,Taub>I was recovering from the flu.

<12-11,Foreman>你除了找借口和三心二意啥都不会
<12-11,Foreman>You're nothing but excuses and distractions.

406
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:10,870
<12-12,Taub>这跟你的自以为是与感觉良好
<12-12,Taub>Well, it's a nice match with your condescension

407
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:13,640
<12-12,Taub>有的一拼
<12-12,Taub>and superiority.

<13-2,Masters>我们给她用了β-受体阻滞药
<13-2,Masters>We started her on a beta blocker.

412
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,590
<13-2,Masters>这会控制好她的心率
<13-2,Masters>It should keep her heart rhythm under control.

413
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,200
<13-2,Masters>在我们做更多检查期间  她会保持稳定
<13-2,Masters>She'll be fine while we run more tests.

414

<13-3,Elena>你听到她不让我进屋了吗
<13-3,Elena>Did you hear that she banned me from her room?

420
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:07,540
<13-4,Masters>是我挑起了争吵
<13-4,Masters>I started the fight.

421

<13-4,Masters>我们需要她心跳加快  所以我激怒了你
<13-4,Masters>We needed her heart rate to rise, so I provoked you.

436
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:02,760
<14-2,Chase>是因为她失去了蛋白质的味觉

<16-6,House>But I never had a cat.

496
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:34,180
<16-6,House>要不晚上八点来接我吧
<16-6,House>Why don't you pick me up at 8:00?

497
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,090
<17-1,Chase>你还需使用一轮类固醇
<17-1,Chase>You're gonna need another round of steroids.

498
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:44,150
<17-1,Chase>同时  我会开始对你进行透析
<17-1,Chase>In the meantime, I'll start your dialysis.

499
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:47,110
<17-1,Chase>我听说艾琳娜可能会再过来
<17-1,Chase>So I heard Elena might be coming back.

500
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:50,920
<17-2,Nadia>你觉得我...
<17-2,Nadia>You think I was...

501
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,720
<17-2,Nadia>对她态度太糟了吗
<17-2,Nadia>too hard on her?

502
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:53,930
<17-3,Chase>我们都会记仇
<17-3,Chase>Well, we all hold our grudges.

503
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,860
<17-3,Chase>我这不是怨恨
<17-3,Chase>It's not a grudge.

504
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:57,510
<17-4,Nadia>而是常识
<17-4,Nadia>It's common sense.

505
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:58,690
<17-4,Nadia>就是简单的算术
<17-4,Nadia>It's simple math.

506
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:01,140
<17-4,Nadia>她对我的伤害多过帮助
<17-4,Nadia>She's hurt me more than she's helped me.

507
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,610
<17-4,Nadia>绝大多数人会扭曲他们的记忆
<17-4,Nadia>Most people edit their memories.

508
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,150
<17-4,Nadia>他们会加些无伤大雅的小谎
<17-4,Nadia>They add small, little lies

509
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:06,550
<17-4,Nadia>这样就不用面对事实的真相
<17-4,Nadia>so they don't have to face the truth.

510
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:08,680
<17-4,Nadia>但我的记忆始终保持原样
<17-4,Nadia>My memories remain the same.

511
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,730
<17-4,Nadia>我记忆中的事实不会改变是因为
<17-4,Nadia>My truth never changes, because...

512
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:13,400
<17-4,Nadia>我的记忆就是事实
<17-4,Nadia>my truth is the truth.

513
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:17,370
<17-5,Chase>所以任何人都得不到你的原谅吗
<17-5,Chase>So no one ever gets forgiven?

514
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:18,790
<17-5,Chase>这样生活岂不是很孤独
<17-5,Chase>Sounds like a lonely way to live.

515
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:20,510
<17-6,Nadia>不  我会原谅别人
<17-6,Nadia>No, I-I do forgive.

516
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:24,030
<17-6,Nadia>只要他们做的好事...
<17-6,Nadia>As long as the good things they do...

517
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:26,930
<17-6,Nadia>超过
<17-6,Nadia>outweigh...

518
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:31,080
<17-6,Nadia>我  我无法呼吸了
<17-6,Nadia>I can't, I can't breathe.

519
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:46,920
<18-1,Taub>怎么了
<18-1,Taub>What?

520
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:48,230
<18-2,Foreman>没有  我只是
<18-2,Foreman>Nothing, I just...

521
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:51,760
<18-3,Taub>一直想象你的家里会铺长绒地毯
<18-3,Taub>always pictured your place with shag carpet.

522
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,030
<18-3,Taub>就像那种
<18-3,Taub>Like kind of a

523
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:55,470
<18-3,Taub>《卧底侦查队》里用的
<18-3,Taub>Mod Squad vibe.

525
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,260
<18-3,Taub>不是因为你是黑人的关系
<18-3,Taub>Not because of the black thing.

526
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,260
<18-3,Taub>我只是一直以为你更...
<18-3,Taub>I always thought you were more of...

527
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:01,430
<18-4,Foreman>你只能在这间房和马库斯的旧屋里活动
<18-4,Foreman>You're limited to this room and Marcus's old room.

528
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,290
<18-5,Taub>马库斯去哪了
<18-5,Taub>Where's Marcus?

529
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:04,540
<18-6,Foreman>据他说  正在佛罗里达给叔叔干活
<18-6,Foreman>He tells me he's working with our uncle in Florida.

530
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,590
<18-7,Taub>据他说
<18-7,Taub>He tells you?

531
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:06,800
<18-8,Foreman>你不许盯着任何不属于你的东西看
<18-8,Foreman>You don't look at or touch anything

532
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:08,910
<18-8,Foreman>也不许碰  包括食物
<18-8,Foreman>that doesn't belong to you, including food.

533
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:10,470
<18-8,Foreman>你老实的学习  睡觉
<18-8,Foreman>You will study and you will sleep.

534
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,330
<18-8,Foreman>考试前  都不许离开我的视线
<18-8,Foreman>And you will not leave my sight until the exam.

535
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,720
<18-9,Taub>行  那我明早天亮了再回来
<18-9,Taub>Great, I'll be back bright and early tomorrow, and...

536
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:16,370
<18-10,Foreman>这事已不仅仅关系到你的未来
<18-10,Foreman>This is no longer just about your future.

537
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:19,730
<18-10,Foreman>也影响到我的前途
<18-10,Foreman>It's about mine, too.

538
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:22,660
<18-10,Foreman>要是你考砸了  我绝对不会放过你
<18-10,Foreman>You fail, and I will kill you.

539
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:25,930
<18-11,Chase>出现呼吸窘迫说明
<18-11,Chase>Respiratory distress means

540
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:27,630
<18-11,Chase>不是自身免疫疾病
<18-11,Chase>we were wrong about autoimmune.

541
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:31,880
<18-12,Masters>可能是肾衰竭导致的肺水肿
<18-12,Masters>Could be pulmonary edema from renal failure.

542
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,430
<18-13,House>肺水肿不会引起荨麻疹[过敏引起的]
<18-13,House>Pulmonary edema doesn't give you hives.

543
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,610
<18-14,Chase>你觉得这是过敏反应吗
<18-14,Chase>You think this is an allergic reaction?

544
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:41,700
<18-14,Chase>不可能  她体内注满了类固醇
<18-14,Chase>It can't be. We pumped her full of steroids.

545
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,320
<18-15,House>如果这过敏非常棘手  是有可能的
<18-15,House>It can be. If it was a really, really bad one.

546
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:07,540
<18-16,House>有好消息也有坏消息
<18-16,House>I have good news and bad news.

547
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:08,950
<18-16,House>好消息是  我对你的诊断是正确的
<18-16,House>The good news is I was right about

548
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:11,800
<18-16,House>你患有某种自身免疫病
<18-16,House>you having some autoimmune disease.

549
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:15,390
<18-16,House>你只是对透析过敏
<18-16,House>You're just allergic to the dialysis.

550
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:17,330
<18-17,Nadia>但如果我不能进行透析
<18-17,Nadia>But if I can't have dialysis

551
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:20,800
<18-17,Nadia>而我的肾又在衰竭
<18-17,Nadia>and my kidneys are failing,

552
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:25,710
<18-17,Nadia>岂不是说我就要死了
<18-17,Nadia>won't that mean I'll die?

553
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:28,490
<18-18,House>你已经知道坏消息是什么了
<18-18,House>Well, you figured out the bad news.

554
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:29,960
<19-1,Masters>那我们怎么办
<19-1,Masters>What do we do?

555
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,330
<19-2,Chase>我们换个病例诊治
<19-2,Chase>We look for another case.

556
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:32,670
<19-2,Chase>即便你对自身免疫病的诊断是正确的
<19-2,Chase>Even if you're right about autoimmune,

557
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,230
<19-2,Chase>我们眼下也没有时间去证明
<19-2,Chase>we now don't have time to prove it.

558
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,010
<19-2,Chase>移植委员会是不会给她一个肾脏的
<19-2,Chase>The transplant board will never give her a kidney.

559
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:36,960
<19-3,Masters>也许我们不需要他们批准
<19-3,Masters>Maybe we could go around them,

560
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:38,730
<19-3,Masters>找她的亲属捐献
<19-3,Masters>get a relative to donate.

561
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:39,900
<19-4,Chase>哪个亲戚啊
<19-4,Chase>Which relative?

562
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:41,030
<19-4,Chase>你是说那个转身离开
<19-4,Chase>The sister who walked away

563
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,270
<19-4,Chase>还告诉你"绝不会回来"的姐姐吗
<19-4,Chase>and told you she was never coming back?

564
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:43,450
<19-5,Masters>你明知道这是我们害的
<19-5,Masters>We caused this, you know.

565
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:45,110
<19-5,Masters>她们的确不和  但我们把情况变得更糟
<19-5,Masters>They were estranged, but we made it worse.

566
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:47,520
<19-6,Chase>早在我们干涉前她们的关系就没回转的余地了
<19-6,Chase>That relationship was broken long before we got there.

567
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:50,530
<19-6,Chase>娜迪娅实际上量化了她们的关系
<19-6,Chase>Nadia literally keeps score.

568
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:52,540
<19-6,Chase>她把所有的事都计算得很清楚
<19-6,Chase>She tallies everything.

569
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,690
<19-6,Chase>她觉得艾琳娜
<19-6,Chase>She decided Elena's done

570
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:55,140
<19-6,Chase>对她的伤害多过帮助
<19-6,Chase>more bad things to her than good,

571
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:56,650
<19-6,Chase>不值得她再投入感情
<19-6,Chase>Doesn't deserve her affection.

572
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:59,470
<19-7,House>我确定她没错
<19-7,House>I'm sure she's right.

573
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,230
<19-7,House>和世上的其他人不一样
<19-7,House>Unlike everybody else in the world,

574
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:04,570
<19-7,House>她的记忆力让她得以
<19-7,House>her memory seems to let her keep

575
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:05,670
<19-7,House>用绝对客观的眼光
<19-7,House>a pure and objective view

576
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,720
<19-7,House>看待与她相处的人
<19-7,House>of people in realtionships.

577
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:09,630
<19-7,House>不会因为个人的偏见和纠结的过去
<19-7,House>There's no petty emotions or agendas

578
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:10,810
<19-7,House>蒙蔽了双眼
<19-7,House>fogging the windshield.

579
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:12,010
<19-8,Masters>这有什么错
<19-8,Masters>Why is that so wrong?

580
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,260
<19-8,Masters>因为这使她要在205号病房
<19-8,Masters>'cause it's making her die alone

581
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,880
<19-8,Masters>孤独地死于肾衰竭
<19-8,Masters>of kidney failure in room 205?

582
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:15,980
<19-9,House>并不一定
<19-9,House>Not necessarily.

583
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,720
<19-9,House>娜迪娅的姐姐跟她不一样
<19-9,House>Nadia's sister's not like her.

584
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:19,480
<19-9,House>我肯定她是受主观情感支配的
<19-9,House>I'm sure she's got plenty of subjective emotions

585
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:20,670
<19-9,House>我们可以好好利用
<19-9,House>we can exploit.

586
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,040
<19-9,House>你干嘛不化内疚为动力
<19-9,House>Why don't you go channel your guilt,

587
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,860
<19-9,House>看能不能让她捐个肾出来
<19-9,House>see if you can get her to cough up a kidney?

588
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,560
<19-10,Masters>我吗  我不是很擅长这种事
<19-10,Masters>Me? I'm not good at that type of thing.

589
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:27,560
<19-10,Masters>应该让其他人去
<19-10,Masters>Someone else should go.

590
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:30,430
<19-11,House>这事是你搞砸的
<19-11,House>Someone else didn't screw this up.

591
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:31,430
<19-12,Masters>不是我
<19-12,Masters>I didn't!

592
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:33,540
<19-13,House>别说你不过是奉命而为的替罪羊
<19-13,House>You were just obeying orders, right?

593
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,750
<19-13,House>自己解决这个问题
<19-13,House>Go fix this.

594
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,540
<19-13,House>什么嘛
<19-13,House>What..

595
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:44,950
<20-1,Masters>我的本意不是让你们仇视对方
<20-1,Masters>I didn't mean to make you hate her.

596
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:49,880
<20-1,Masters>而现在她的肾衰竭了  我...
<20-1,Masters>And...now that her kidneys have failed, I--

597
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:52,800
<20-1,Masters>我一直以来都是个书呆子  只会直线思考
<20-1,Masters>I've a always been a book and equations person.

598
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:56,100
<20-1,Masters>人们总是自寻烦恼
<20-1,Masters>People are problematic.

599
00:23:56,210 --> 00:24:00,470
<20-1,Masters>随心所欲  乱七八糟
<20-1,Masters>And...random and messy.

600
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:03,150
<20-1,Masters>而和姐妹相处
<20-1,Masters>And with sisters...

601
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:06,150
<20-1,Masters>我是说我有个非常亲密的表妹
<20-1,Masters>I mean, I had a cousin who I was close to,

602
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:08,060
<20-1,Masters>当我们的生理期撞在一起
<20-1,Masters>and when our menstrual cycles synced,

603
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:10,270
<20-1,Masters>就跟在角斗士学校一样
<20-1,Masters>it was like gladiator school--

604
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:14,660
<20-2,Elena>你是想让我给她捐一个肾吗
<20-2,Elena>Do you want me to donate a kidney to my sister?

605
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:17,600
<20-3,Masters>是的
<20-3,Masters>Yes.

606
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:20,200
<20-4,Elena>好的
<20-4,Elena>Okay.

607
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,770
<20-4,Elena>真的吗
<20-4,Elena>Really?

608
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:25,350
<20-5,Masters>这么做也不一定能改善你们的关系
<20-5,Masters>It might not fix your relationship.

609
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:27,300
<20-5,Masters>我好像不该提这个
<20-5,Masters>Probably shouldn't have said that.

610
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,700
<21-1,Foreman>左边  注意你的左边
<21-1,Foreman>Your left, on your left.

611
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,320
<21-2,Taub>别发牢骚了
<21-2,Taub>Stop whining already.

612
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:31,390
<21-2,Taub>我正要换成狙击枪
<21-2,Taub>I was getting a sniper.

613
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:32,830
<21-3,Foreman>休息时间还剩五分钟
<21-3,Foreman>Five minutes left in the break.

614
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:35,270
<21-4,Taub>但过了冷却池就到下一关了
<21-4,Taub>But the next level's just past the cooling tanks.

615
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,540
<21-5,Foreman>刚才说好的  休息之后
<21-5,Foreman>That was the deal. We take this break,

616
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:37,870
<21-5,Foreman>你做一份模拟题
<21-5,Foreman>you do a practice test.

617
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:46,670
<21-6,Taub>其实  我没有感冒
<21-6,Taub>I-I didn't have the flu.

618
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:50,610
<21-6,Taub>我就是  发挥失常了
<21-6,Taub>I just...choked.

619
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,270
<21-7,Foreman>你每天都在做出生死抉择
<21-7,Foreman>You make life and death decisions every day.

620
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,130
<21-7,Foreman>你可是在豪斯手下干活
<21-7,Foreman>You work for House.

621
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,570
<21-7,Foreman>你压力一直很大  可从未却步退缩
<21-7,Foreman>You're under constant pressure, and you never choke.

622
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:09,390
<21-8,Taub>在初次病理学学会的考试中我拿了满分
<21-8,Taub>I got a perfect score on my first Pathology Boards.

623
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,680
<21-8,Taub>我一直在想  "无论我这次得分多少
<21-8,Taub>I kept thinking, "Whatever my score is now,

624
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:15,330
<21-8,Taub>"都会成为衡量现在的我
<21-8,Taub>"it's going to be a measure of the distance

625
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:19,030
<21-8,Taub>与过去的我之间差距的标杆"
<21-8,Taub>between me and the man I used to be."

626
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:21,080
<21-9,Foreman>你不能再这样自我施压了
<21-9,Foreman>You gotta stop psyching yourself out.

627
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,590
<21-10,Taub>上次考试是在
<21-10,Taub>Well, the last test was before

628
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:26,020
<21-10,Taub>我失去妻子和家庭之前
<21-10,Taub>I lost my wife and my home,

629
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:30,640
<21-10,Taub>所以我肯定下一次会好得多
<21-10,Taub>so I'm sure the next one will go much better.

630
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:45,930
<21-11,Foreman>有时  我半夜醒来
<21-11,Foreman>Sometimes, I wake up in the middle of the night,

631
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,860
<21-11,Foreman>之后就辗转难眠
<21-11,Foreman>and I can't sleep for hours

632
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:51,620
<21-11,Foreman>因为我担心自己的诊断出了错
<21-11,Foreman>'cause I'm worried I got the diagnosis wrong.

633
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:57,270
<21-11,Foreman>船到桥头自然直  没事的
<21-11,Foreman>These things work out.

634
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:07,650
<22-1,Chase>我们找到一个捐献人
<22-1,Chase>We found a donor.

635
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,370
<22-1,Chase>是你姐姐
<22-1,Chase>It's your sister.

636
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,740
<22-1,Chase>我想你应该知道这个
<22-1,Chase>Just thought you should know.

637
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:48,970
<22-1,Chase>娜迪娅  能听到我说话吗
<22-1,Chase>Nadia, can you hear me?

638
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,240
<22-1,Chase>麻醉的药效正在退去
<22-1,Chase>You're coming out of your anesthesia.

639
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:53,620
<23-1,Chase>你会觉得有点醉晕
<23-1,Chase>You're gonna feel a bit groggy.

640
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:55,910
<23-1,Chase>你表现很好
<23-1,Chase>You did great.

641
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:58,320
<23-1,Chase>看上去情况不错
<23-1,Chase>Everything's looking good.

642
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,700
<23-1,Chase>娜迪娅  醒一醒
<23-1,Chase>Nadia, come on now.

643
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:02,220
<23-1,Chase>睁开眼睛
<23-1,Chase>Open your eyes.

644
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:06,170
<23-2,Chase>给我三毫克氯羟去甲安定
<23-2,Chase>Three milligrams of lorazepam,

645
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,770
<23-2,Chase>还需要吸引器
<23-2,Chase>and I'm going to need suction.

646
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:15,770
<24-1,Chase>痉挛发作说明类固醇没有用
<24-1,Chase>Seizures mean the steroids aren't working.

647
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:16,910
<24-1,Chase>测验结果也出来了
<24-1,Chase>And we got the tests back.

648
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,940
<24-2,Masters>我们错了  不是自身免疫病
<24-2,Masters>We were wrong. It's not autoimmune.

649
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,220
<24-3,Chase>可能是急性间歇性卟啉病
<24-3,Chase>Could be acute porphyria.

650
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,980
<24-4,Masters>没有腹部疼痛
<24-4,Masters>No abdominal pain.

651
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:25,950
<24-5,House>病人有没有感谢她姐姐
<24-5,House>Did the patient thank her sister?

652
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:28,070
<24-6,Chase>没  至少现在还没
<24-6,Chase>Not yet, at least.

653
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:29,270
<24-7,House>看看结果会如何
<24-7,House>See if she will.

654
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:30,290
<24-8,Masters>你想知道什么
<24-8,Masters>What are you trying to find out?

655
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:31,670
<24-9,House>她是否实话实说
<24-9,House>If she's telling the truth.

656
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:34,530
<24-9,House>她声称自己在用客观的眼光看现实
<24-9,House>She claims she objectively sees reality.

657
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:36,050
<24-9,House>通过权衡善恶来评判别人
<24-9,House>Weighing the good and bad in people.

658
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:37,020
<24-9,House>如果真是这样
<24-9,House>If that's true,

659
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:38,410
<24-9,House>我觉得不管她姐姐曾有多少次
<24-9,House>I don't care how many times her sister

660
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,580
<24-9,House>不问自取地用她的发带
<24-9,House>borrowed her scrunchie without asking,

661
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,720
<24-9,House>给她捐肾应该能化解一切
<24-9,House>a free kidney ought to trump all the bad stuff.

662
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,770
<24-10,Masters>如果不是这样呢
<24-10,Masters>And if it doesn't?

663
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,560
<24-11,House>那说明她和我们一样  是烂人一个
<24-11,House>That means she sucks, like the rest of us.

664
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:47,690
<24-12,Chase>我们还没考虑过血液疾病
<24-12,Chase>We haven't considered her blood.

665
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:48,980
<24-12,Chase>血管凝块会引发腿部  心脏
<24-12,Chase>Clots could hit her leg, heart,

666
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,220
<24-12,Chase>肾脏和脑部问题
<24-12,Chase>kidney, and brain.

667
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:51,720
<24-13,House>凝血因子V Leiden基因突变
<24-13,House>Factor V Leiden.

668
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,340
<24-13,House>如果是这样的话  是最容易治疗的
<24-13,House>Easiest to treat, if we're right.

669
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:55,520
<24-13,House>给她用肝素开始治疗
<24-13,House>Start her on heparin.

670
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:58,520
<24-13,House>记得问她要不要感谢她姐
<24-13,House>And ask for the thank-you.

671
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:02,810
<25-1,Taub>我答得怎么样
<25-1,Taub>How'd I do?

672
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:04,030
<25-2,Foreman>挺不错
<25-2,Foreman>Great.

673
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:05,640
<25-2,Foreman>不错
<25-2,Foreman>Great?

674
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,630
<25-3,Taub>怎么个不错法
<25-3,Taub>How great?

675
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:07,660
<25-3,Taub>我答错了几道
<25-3,Taub>How many did I miss?

676
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:08,700
<25-4,Foreman>数字并不重要
<25-4,Foreman>It's not about the numbers.

677
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:09,800
<25-4,Foreman>别...
<25-4,Foreman>Don't...

678
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:11,250
<25-5,Taub>才答对了54%
<25-5,Taub>54%?

679
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:12,560
<25-6,Foreman>模拟题总是要比
<25-6,Foreman>Th-they make the practice tests harder

680
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,800
<25-6,Foreman>正式考试难
<25-6,Foreman>than the actual exam.

681
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:16,310
<25-7,Taub>我的天  我在你客厅里也不能正常发挥
<25-7,Taub>Oh, my god, now I'm choking in your living room.

682
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,950
<25-7,Taub>这样不行
<25-7,Taub>This isn't gonna work.

683
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,020
<25-8,Foreman>你要给谁打电话
<25-8,Foreman>Who are you calling?

684
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,180
<25-9,Taub>我找到一个人
<25-9,Taub>I found the guy.

685
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:22,810
<25-9,Taub>他肯卖我试卷副本
<25-9,Taub>He can sell me a copy of the test.

686
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,620
<25-9,Taub>我知道这是作弊
<25-9,Taub>I know it's cheating,

687
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:26,460
<25-9,Taub>我做人也很失败
<25-9,Taub>And I suck as a person.

688
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:28,710
<25-9,Taub>但明天早上就要考试了
<25-9,Taub>But the test is tomorrow morning.

689
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:31,500
<25-10,Foreman>这不是作弊的问题  这关乎你的自信
<25-10,Foreman>It's not about the cheating. It's about your confidence.

690
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,980
<25-10,Foreman>你一旦作弊了  自信就再也找不回来了
<25-10,Foreman>You steal that test, and you'll never get it back.

691
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:40,090
<25-11,Taub>我没法面对人生中的再一次失败了
<25-11,Taub>I can't handle failing at one more thing in my life.

692
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:42,170
<25-12,Foreman>你是个好医生
<25-12,Foreman>You're a good doctor.

693
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:43,430
<25-12,Foreman>我很清楚你的能力
<25-12,Foreman>I've seen what you're capable of.

694
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:45,580
<25-12,Foreman>反映迅速  大胆而果断
<25-12,Foreman>You're fast, you're decisive, and you're bold.

695
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:47,230
<25-12,Foreman>有这种能力的人
<25-12,Foreman>And those are not the qualities of someone

696
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:48,840
<25-12,Foreman>是绝不用偷试题的
<25-12,Foreman>who needs to steal a test.

697
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,730
<25-12,Foreman>对于考试内容  你早就了如指掌
<25-12,Foreman>There is nothing on it that you don't already know.

698
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,050
<25-12,Foreman>你只需认识到自己的能力
<25-12,Foreman>You just need to know that you know it.

699
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:55,110
<25-13,Taub>继续讲
<25-13,Taub>Keep talking.

700
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,020
<25-14,Foreman>这个团队缺你不可
<25-14,Foreman>We need you on the team.

701
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,180
<25-14,Foreman>所以我们要坐在这  再做套模拟题
<25-14,Foreman>So we're gonna sit here and take another practice test

702
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,280
<25-14,Foreman>我们就不停地练习
<25-14,Foreman>and we're gonna keep taking them

703
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:01,620
<25-14,Foreman>直到你把它搞定
<25-14,Foreman>until you've kicked its ass!

704
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,210
<25-14,Foreman>你能行的  听到了吗
<25-14,Foreman>You can do this! You feel me?

705
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:06,410
<25-15,Taub>是的
<25-15,Taub>Yeah.

706
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:29,900
<26-1,Taub>感觉跟杀人毁尸回来似的
<26-1,Taub>I feel like we just buried a hooker in the desert.

707
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:31,170
<26-2,Foreman>长风破浪会有时
<26-2,Foreman>There'll definitely be another time

708
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:32,830
<26-2,Foreman>直挂云帆济沧海
<26-2,Foreman>to rise up and turn things around.

709
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:33,940
<26-2,Foreman>你会好起来的
<26-2,Foreman>You'll come back from it.

710
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,340
<26-3,Taub>下次吧
<26-3,Taub>Next time.

711
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:46,350
<27-1,Chase>感觉如何
<27-1,Chase>How are you feeling?

712
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:49,550
<27-2,Nadia>没任何好转
<27-2,Nadia>N-not any better.

713
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:52,850
<27-3,Chase>血栓溶解需要一段时间
<27-3,Chase>It'll take some time for the clots to resolve.

714
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:56,190
<27-3,Chase>你姐姐恢复得很顺利
<27-3,Chase>Your sister's recovering well.

715
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:59,330
<27-3,Chase>如果你真是在计较善恶
<27-3,Chase>If you're really adding up the good and bad...

716
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,430
<27-4,Nadia>我可以见她吗
<27-4,Nadia>Can I see her

717
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:09,800
<27-4,Nadia>太胖
<27-4,Nadia>Too fat.

718
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:11,400
<27-4,Nadia>太瘦
<27-4,Nadia>Too thin.

719
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:13,040
<28-1,House>太饥渴
<28-1,House>Too desperate.

720
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:15,110
<28-1,House>不够饥渴
<28-1,House>Not desperate enough.

721
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,640
<28-1,House>你也来评头论足嘛
<28-1,House>Come on, you can insult them too.

722
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:19,980
<28-2,Wilson>我看不必
<28-2,Wilson>I'd rather not.

723
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:21,350
<28-3,House>现在批判个彻底
<28-3,House>If you objectify them now,

724
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:23,250
<28-3,House>待会儿你把她们绑在地下室桌子上
<28-3,House>you'll feel more comfortable when you...

725
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:26,220
<28-3,House>会感觉自然很多
<28-3,House>tie them to a table in your basement later.

726
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:28,720
<28-3,House>其它花招也行
<28-3,House>Or whatever.

727
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:30,560
<28-3,House>好吧
<28-3,House>Okay.

728
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,890
<28-4,Wilson>腋下脂肪太多
<28-4,Wilson>Too armpit fatty.

729
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:37,260
<28-5,House>那个  太正点
<28-5,House>Whoa! Too hot.

730
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:38,630
<28-6,Wilson>我认识她
<28-6,Wilson>I actually know her.

731
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,830
<28-6,Wilson>她是咖啡屋的新服务员
<28-6,Wilson>She's the new barista at my coffee shop.

732
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,230
<28-6,Wilson>正在攻读经济学硕士
<28-6,Wilson>She's getting her Masters in finance.

733
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,430
<28-7,House>胸大有脑
<28-7,House>Brains and boobs.

734
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,600
<28-7,House>一座富矿
<28-7,House>The mother lode.

735
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:46,300
<28-8,Wilson>可惜服务员当得特烂
<28-8,Wilson>Total moron as a barista, though.

736
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:47,670
<28-8,Wilson>不论我点什么饮料
<28-8,Wilson>Every drink I order

737
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:48,670
<28-8,Wilson>她都给我加奶泡
<28-8,Wilson>ends up with whipped cream on it.

738
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:50,610
<28-9,House>嘱咐她不加都不管用
<28-9,House>Even when I say no whip.

739
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:55,610
<28-9,House>姑娘  意思是人家喜欢你
<28-9,House>Girlfriend, that means she's into you.

740
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,250
<28-10,Wilson>好吧
<28-10,Wilson>Okay.

741
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:07,990
<28-11,House>你好  我叫威尔森  詹姆斯·威尔森
<28-11,House>Hi, there. Wilson. James Wilson.

742
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,560
<28-11,House>我是医生
<28-11,House>I'm a doctor.

743
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:10,830
<28-11,House>希望以上信息足够
<28-11,House>I'm hoping that's enough to close,

744
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:12,560
<28-11,House>因为我是社交白痴
<28-11,House>because I'm also a social moron.

745
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:14,000
<28-11,House>我还养了只猫
<28-11,House>And I have a cat.

746
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,310
<28-12,Wilson>她说她想打奶泡的
<28-12,Wilson>She said my coffee is not the only thing

747
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:31,050
<28-12,Wilson>可不止是我的咖啡而已
<28-12,Wilson>she'd like to put whipped cream on.

748
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:32,750
<28-13,House>但她的确对你有意思吧
<28-13,House>Yeah, but is she interested.

749
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:46,560
<28-14,House>酒保
<28-14,House>Bartender!

750
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:48,530
<28-14,House>每人一杯香槟
<28-14,House>Champagne for everyone!

751
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:09,180
<29-1,Elena>谢谢你
<29-1,Elena>Thank you.

752
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:10,780
<29-2,Nadia>救了我一命
<29-2,Nadia>for saving my life.

753
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:13,310
<29-3,Elena>我爱你
<29-3,Elena>I love you, you know.

754
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:19,660
<29-4,Nadia>我刚想起了
<29-4,Nadia>I was thinking about those times

755
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:21,690
<29-4,Nadia>我们曾一起去斯波福德湖过暑假
<29-4,Nadia>we went up to Spofford Lake in the summer.

756
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:25,460
<29-4,Nadia>每次划独木舟
<29-4,Nadia>Whenever we took out the canoe,

757
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:27,560
<29-4,Nadia>都是你替我系好救生衣
<29-4,Nadia>you'd tie up my life vest for me.

758
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:30,500
<29-4,Nadia>下午带我溜进储藏室
<29-4,Nadia>In the afternoon, sneak me into the lodge

759
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:32,570
<29-4,Nadia>一起偷冰棍
<29-4,Nadia>so we could steal popsicles.

760
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:38,140
<29-4,Nadia>或许我们可以和好如初
<29-4,Nadia>Maybe we could go back.

761
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:41,180
<29-5,Elena>我可以开车去  我们住一间小屋
<29-5,Elena>I could drive us up there. We could get a cabin and...

762
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:45,120
<29-5,Elena>还可以租独木舟
<29-5,Elena>And maybe rent a canoe.

763
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,820
<29-5,Elena>我好久没想起过
<29-5,Elena>Oh, wow, I haven't...

764
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,250
<29-5,Elena>斯波福德湖
<29-5,Elena>thought of Spofford in...

765
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:52,620
<29-5,Elena>娜迪娅
<29-5,Elena>Nadia...

766
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,990
<29-6,Elena>你没事吧
<29-6,Elena>Are you okay?

767
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:57,660
<29-7,Nadia>艾琳娜  对不起  我做不到
<29-7,Nadia>Elena, I'm sorry! I can't do this!

768
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:13,240
<29-8,Nadia>停一下
<29-8,Nadia>Can you stop?

769
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:14,810
<29-8,Nadia>停下别推我
<29-8,Nadia>Just stop pushing me for a minute.

770
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:22,450
<29-9,Chase>我现在懂了
<29-9,Chase>I understand now

771
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,220
<29-9,Chase>你为何在餐馆打工
<29-9,Chase>why you stuck yourself in that diner,

772
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:27,290
<29-9,Chase>远离家人朋友
<29-9,Chase>away from friends, away from family.

773
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:32,460
<29-9,Chase>你无法原谅任何人
<29-9,Chase>You can't forgive anyone.

774
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:34,190
<29-9,Chase>我认为你不是在权衡
<29-9,Chase>I don't think you weigh anything.

775
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:36,480
<29-9,Chase>你只是跟多数人一样
<29-9,Chase>I think you're like a lot of people.

776
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,810
<29-9,Chase>对不开心的往事耿耿于怀
<29-9,Chase>You focus on the bad memories

777
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:40,630
<29-9,Chase>忘记了欢乐
<29-9,Chase>instead of the good.

778
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:43,470
<29-10,Nadia>我别无选择
<29-10,Nadia>I don't have a choice.

779
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,780
<29-11,Chase>娜迪娅  把手在腿上放一下
<29-11,Chase>Nadia, put your hand in your lap for a moment.

780
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:55,780
<29-12,Nadia>-我没动  -我知道
<29-12,Nadia>- I'm not doing that. - I know.

781
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:58,450
<29-13,Chase>这是一种无意识动作  叫做舞蹈病
<29-13,Chase>It's an involuntary movement called choreia.

782
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,120
<29-14,Nadia>说明什么
<29-14,Nadia>What does it mean?

783
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:02,520
<29-15,Chase>说明我们仍然不知道你的病因
<29-15,Chase>It means we still don't know what's wrong with you.

784
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:15,320
<30-1,Cuddy>谢谢
<30-1,Cuddy>Thank you.

785
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:22,360
<30-2,House>据你所知  威尔森之前喜欢的那个急诊护士
<30-2,House>Do you know if that... O.R. Nurse that Wilson liked

786
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:24,430
<30-2,House>有没有跟男友分手
<30-2,House>ever broke up with her boyfriend?

787
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,360
<30-3,Cuddy>你的威尔森痴迷症不是过去了吗
<30-3,Cuddy>I thought your Wilson fetish was over.

788
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:28,100
<30-4,House>我得找好备胎
<30-4,House>I'm putting together a second string

789
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:31,240
<30-4,House>以防大胸服务员那边进展不顺
<30-4,House>in case things don't go well with the well-breasted barista.

790
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,370
<30-5,Cuddy>你不能总管着他
<30-5,Cuddy>You've gotta let that guy alone.

791
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,970
<30-6,House>他不该没人管
<30-6,House>He's not supposed to be alone.

792
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,340
<30-7,Cuddy>这就是你心结所在
<30-7,Cuddy>Is that what this is about?

793
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:38,640
<30-7,Cuddy>威尔森孤身一人你却有了伴儿
<30-7,Cuddy>You feel guilty because

794
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:42,050
<30-7,Cuddy>所以你有负罪感是吗
<30-7,Cuddy>Wilson's the one that's alone and not you?

795
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:43,820
<30-7,Cuddy>你仍然认为自己不配得到幸福
<30-7,Cuddy>You still don't think you deserve this.

796
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,280
<30-8,House>你才知道我吗
<30-8,House>Have you met me?

797
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:50,890
<30-9,Cuddy>你的幸福并不是他不幸的原因
<30-9,Cuddy>Your happiness doesn't take his away.

798
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,660
<30-9,Cuddy>心安理得是可以的
<30-9,Cuddy>It's okay to enjoy it.

799
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,300
<30-11,Foreman>舞蹈病  排除了血液凝固功能失常
<30-11,Foreman>Choreia. Rules out the clotting disorder.

800
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:03,600
<30-11,Foreman>我们又回到了原点
<30-11,Foreman>Means we're back to square one.

801
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:04,770
<30-12,Masters>如果病症已发展到脑部
<30-12,Masters>If it's hit her brain,

802
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,940
<30-12,Masters>说明她时间不多了
<30-12,Masters>that could mean she doesn't have long.

803
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,870
<30-13,House>那么现在的问题是
<30-13,House>So then the question becomes,

804
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,470
<30-13,House>她姐姐会参加她的葬礼吗
<30-13,House>will the sister show up at the funeral?

805
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,310
<30-14,Chase>她试图与姐姐和解
<30-14,Chase>She tried to reconcile,

806
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:13,610
<30-14,Chase>但是糟糕的回忆占了上风  她退缩了
<30-14,Chase>but the bad memories crowded out the good, and she ran.

807
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,710
<30-15,House>人无完人
<30-15,House>Nobody's perfect.

808
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:16,210
<30-15,House>还有什么
<30-15,House>What else?

809
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:21,380
<30-15,House>我们需要的信息她都有
<30-15,House>Come on, the woman has all the information we need.

810
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:23,890
<30-15,House>她本身就是一座诊断库
<30-15,House>She's a bottomless diagnostic library.

811
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:25,920
<30-16,Masters>或许我们忽略了她住处的信息
<30-16,Masters>Maybe we're missing something from the apartment.

812
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:27,120
<30-16,Masters>生活方式方面的
<30-16,Masters>Some lifestyle thing.

813
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:28,590
<30-17,Foreman>有道理  她拼了几百幅拼图
<30-17,Foreman>Yeah, it's all muscle strain

814
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,790
<30-17,Foreman>造成肌肉拉伤
<30-17,Foreman>from doing her hundreds of Jigsaw puzzles.

815
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:32,090
<30-17,Foreman>我们应该重做核磁共振
<30-17,Foreman>We should do another MRI.

816
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,060
<30-17,Foreman>脑出血会...
<30-17,Foreman>A brain hemorrhage would...

817
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,300
<30-18,House>多少幅拼图
<30-18,House>How many puzzles?

818
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,170
<30-19,Foreman>好吧  我刚才有点儿夸张
<30-19,Foreman>Okay, I was exaggerating.

819
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:39,170
<30-19,Foreman>几十幅
<30-19,Foreman>Dozens.

820
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:43,300
<30-20,House>做周边血涂片
<30-20,House>Do a peripheral blood smear.

821
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:44,440
<30-20,House>找棘红细胞
<30-20,House>Look for acanthocytes.

822
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:45,670
<30-20,House>我马上就到
<30-20,House>I'll be right in.

823
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,840
<31-1,House>还记得我吗
<31-1,House>Remember me?

824
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:53,750
<31-1,House>开个玩笑
<31-1,House>Just kidding.

825
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:56,880
<31-1,House>喜欢拼图游戏
<31-1,House>So...Jigsaw puzzles.

826
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:01,390
<31-2,Nadia>拼图能让我心平气静
<31-2,Nadia>Um, I find them calming.

827
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:03,360
<31-3,House>有没有半途而废的
<31-3,House>You ever left one unfinished?

828
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:06,260
<31-4,Nadia>没有  不拼完我会抓狂
<31-4,Nadia>No, that would drive me crazy.

829
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:07,890
<31-5,House>说到抓狂...
<31-5,House>Speaking of...

830
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:16,130
<31-6,Nadia>你为什么动它
<31-6,Nadia>Why are you doing that?

831
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,040
<31-7,House>更重要的问题是  你又是为什么呢
<31-7,House>More important question is, why are you?

832
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,340
<31-8,Nadia>只是习惯而已
<31-8,Nadia>It's just a habit.

833
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:24,070
<31-9,House>这是一种强迫性的习惯
<31-9,House>It's a habit that compels you in an obsessive way

834
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,180
<31-9,House>已经成了一种病
<31-9,House>that's so bad, it's a disorder.

835
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,510
<31-10,Nadia>我没有强迫症
<31-10,Nadia>I don't have OCD.

836
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:30,450
<31-11,Chase>强迫症患者有不同的表现方式
<31-11,Chase>Each brain with OCD has its own way of filtering it.

837
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,680
<31-11,Chase>有些人不停洗手
<31-11,Chase>Some people wash their hands

838
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:33,080
<31-11,Chase>贮存电视报
<31-11,Chase>and hoard TV guides.

839
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:36,550
<31-11,Chase>你则玩拼图  贮存记忆
<31-11,Chase>You do puzzles and hoard memories.

840
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:40,360
<31-12,House>所以我们以为是天赋的记忆
<31-12,House>So what we thought was a gift...

841
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:45,660
<31-12,House>不过是你对自己生活经历的强迫回忆
<31-12,House>Is just you literally obsessing over your own life.

842
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:47,360
<31-13,Nadia>所以我才无法控制我的记忆
<31-13,Nadia>That's why I can't stop the memories,

843
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:48,830
<31-13,Nadia>怎样努力都不行
<31-13,Nadia>even when I try.

844
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:52,640
<31-13,Nadia>但是其它症状呢
<31-13,Nadia>But everything else?

845
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:53,840
<31-13,Nadia>我的肾脏
<31-13,Nadia>My kidneys?

846
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:56,040
<31-14,House>记忆问题只是更严重疾病的症状

853
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:13,920
<31-15,Nadia>我会死吗

854
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:15,920
<31-16,Chase>此病无法治愈
<31-16,Chase>It can't be cured.

857
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,270
<31-16,Chase>最乐观估计

<32-2,Taub>when you have all the answers.

865
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,260
<32-3,Foreman>这样想吧
<32-3,Foreman>Look at it this way.

866
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:01,070
<32-3,Foreman>考试考得烂
<32-3,Foreman>It's better to suck at taking one test

867
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:04,170
<32-3,Foreman>总比没本事救人强
<32-3,Foreman>than to suck at saving people's lives.

868
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:07,640
<32-5,Taub>瑞秋嫌它太大
<32-5,Taub>Uh, Rachel thought it was too big,

<32-6,Foreman>你要送给我吗
<32-6,Foreman>You're giving it to me?

<32-10,Foreman>你愿意的话  可以住下
<32-10,Foreman>You could stay, if you wanted to.

879
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:39,000
<32-10,Foreman>找好房子再搬
<32-10,Foreman>Just until you find your new place.

00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:41,670
<32-10,Foreman>你走了谁跟我打游戏呀
<32-10,Foreman>Who else am I gonna play savageskate with?

881
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:45,340
<32-11,Taub>不住在一起也可以联机玩嘛
<32-11,Taub>We could do that online from separate houses.

882
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:46,580
<32-12,Foreman>你能不能闭嘴
<32-12,Foreman>Will you shut up?

883
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,180
<32-12,Foreman>能
<32-12,Foreman>Okay.

00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:02,060
<33-2,Nadia>好多了
<33-2,Nadia>Much better.

886
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:05,390
<33-3,Chase>我不相信豪斯说的话
<33-3,Chase>I don't believe what House said.

887
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:09,430
<33-3,Chase>我想豪斯自己如今也不一定拿捏得准
<33-3,Chase>I'm not sure even House believes it anymore.

888
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,800
<33-3,Chase>你之前说你那个样子
<33-3,Chase>You said you didn't have a choice

889
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:14,030
<33-3,Chase>是因为别无选择
<33-3,Chase>to be the way you are.

890
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,870
<33-3,Chase>现在你有选择的机会了
<33-3,Chase>Now you do.

891
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:17,740
<33-3,Chase>这是选择性五羟色胺再摄取抑制剂
<33-3,Chase>These are SSRIs.

892
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:20,110
<33-3,Chase>治疗强迫症比较有效
<33-3,Chase>They've been effective in treating OCD.

893
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:21,810
<33-4,Nadia>我会失去记忆吗
<33-4,Nadia>You mean lose my memory?

894
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,240
<33-5,Chase>不是全部记忆
<33-5,Chase>Not lose it entirely.

895
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:24,880
<33-5,Chase>只是会变得跟其他人差不多
<33-5,Chase>It'll just become more like anyone else's.

896
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:31,020
<33-4,Nadia>我的记忆力
<33-4,Nadia>My memory...

897
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:32,720
<33-6,Nadia>是唯一能让我
<33-6,Nadia>is the only thing

898
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:35,890
<33-6,Nadia>与众不同的东西
<33-6,Nadia>that has ever made me special.

899
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,630
<33-7,Chase>或许如此
<33-7,Chase>Maybe so.

900
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:43,030
<33-7,Chase>但与众不同的代价
<33-7,Chase>But if you want to be special...

901
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:46,200
<33-7,Chase>就是顾影自怜
<33-7,Chase>you're gonna have to be alone.

902
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:26,570
<34-5,House>那是我给莎拉准备的
<34-5,House>Those are for Sarah.

903
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,440
<34-6,Wilson>下毒了吗
<34-6,Wilson>Are they poisoned?

904
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:30,370
<34-7,House>下毒...
<34-7,House>Poi...

<34-7,House>你的被害妄想症啊
<34-7,House>you and your paranoia.

906
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,380
<34-7,House>失陪一下
<34-7,House>Now, if you'll excuse me...

907
00:40:37,610 --> 00:40:41,950
<34-8,House>我该把豚草放得更保险一些才好
<34-8,House>I really should find a better place to store my ragweed.

908
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:43,120
<34-9,Wilson>好意我心领了
<34-9,Wilson>It's a very nice gesture,

909
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,650
<34-9,Wilson>但它还在我公寓里
<34-9,Wilson>but it's still in the apartment.

00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:25,520
<34-11,Wilson>我临阵脱逃了
<34-11,Wilson>I flaked.

920
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:27,590
<34-11,Wilson>送她上车然后说了晚安
<34-11,Wilson>I walked her to her car and said good night.

<34-11,Wilson>我会继续努力的  我...
<34-11,Wilson>I will get back into it, I...
