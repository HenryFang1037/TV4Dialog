2
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:38,050
<1-1,House>救命
<1-1,House>Help me!

3
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,380
<1-1,House>我的干呕症状消失了  我也该离开了
<1-1,House>Dry heaves are gone, so am I.

4
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,800
<2-1,House>我去跟医生核实一下
<2-1,House>I'll check with the doctor.

5
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,090
<2-2,Valdez>大可不必了
<2-2,Valdez>No, no, no, no.

6
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,670
<2-3,House>我是自愿进来的  跟我确认就够了
<2-3,House>I'm here voluntarily, just got to check with me.

7
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:50,650
<2-4,Valdez>抱歉  诺兰医生特别嘱咐过
<2-4,Valdez>I'm sorry. Dr. Nolan left specific instructions.

8
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,470
<3-1,Nolan>她没生病  只是恐惧  所以让她说
<3-1,Nolan>She's not sick. She's scared. So tell her to tell

9
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:01,130
<3-1,Nolan>原来还是个是黑人总管
<3-1,Nolan>And he's black.

10
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:04,830
<3-2,House>那我以为你会对奴隶事件更敏感一点
<3-2,House>I thought you'd be a little more sensitive on the slavery issue.

11
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:18,400
<3-3,House>你们不能留我
<3-3,House>Can't keep me.

12
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,860
<3-4,Nolan>豪斯医生  你看起来好多了
<3-4,Nolan>Dr. House, you look a lot better.

13
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:20,750
<3-4,Nolan>我的确是好多了
<3-4,Nolan>I am a lot better

14
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,340
<3-5,House>不需要止痛药了  幻觉消失
<3-5,House>No painkillers, no Hallucinations.

15
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:24,990
<3-5,House>腿还是痛  但并无大碍
<3-5,House>Leg hurts, but it's manageable.

16
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:26,060
<3-5,House>你很出色
<3-5,House>Great job.

17
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:26,960
<3-5,House>我会想你的
<3-5,House>Gonna miss you.

18
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,290
<3-5,House>而且希望能尽快开始想你
<3-5,House>Want to start missing you as soon as possible.

19
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,040
<3-6,Nolan>从法律上讲  你随时可以离开
<3-6,Nolan>Well, legally, you're free to go whenever you want.

20
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:32,640
<3-6,Nolan>不过我建议你留下来
<3-6,Nolan>But I suggest you stay.

21
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,390
<3-7,House>我会好好考虑的
<3-7,House>I'll take it under advisement.

22
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,100
<3-8,Nolan>如果你认为你产生幻觉是由
<3-8,Nolan>If you thought the hallucinations

23
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,110
<3-8,Nolan>维科丁引起的
<3-8,Nolan>Were from your vicodin problem,

24
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:39,290
<3-8,Nolan>你为什么不去戒毒中心呢
<3-8,Nolan>Why didn't you just check yourself into a rehab facility?

25
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,650
<3-9,House>我那时候被误导以为自己可能疯了
<3-9,House>I was deluded into thinking I might be crazy.

26
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,880
<3-10,Nolan>你已经滥用维科丁这么多年
<3-10,Nolan>But you had been abusing vicodin for years.

27
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:46,240
<3-10,Nolan>从未出现过幻觉  失眠
<3-10,Nolan>Never had delusions, never had trouble sleeping

28
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,410
<3-10,Nolan>除了有自恋和反动倾向之外
<3-10,Nolan>Never had any problems.

29
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,100
<3-10,Nolan>从未出现过任何问题
<3-10,Nolan>Other than narcissism and antisocial behavior,

30
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,510
<3-10,Nolan>直到你的两名手下死去
<3-10,Nolan>Until two colleagues died.

31
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:53,250
<3-10,Nolan>令尊过世
<3-10,Nolan>Your father died.

32
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:56,960
<3-10,Nolan>你的病根远比维科丁深
<3-10,Nolan>Your issues run deeper than vicodin.

33
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:59,990
<3-11,House>这些话才不能让我重新振作  对吧
<3-11,House>Well, that's not gonna cheer me up, is it?

34
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,410
<3-12,Nolan>你需要转到我们的长期住院区
<3-12,Nolan>You need to be transferred to our long-term ward,

35
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,450
<3-12,Nolan>开始用药物和谈心疗法
<3-12,Nolan>Started on medication, talk therapy

36
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,310
<3-12,Nolan>我知道了
<3-12,Nolan>Yeah, I get it.

37
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:08,250
<3-13,House>只是我还有一个心病未了
<3-13,House>Uh, just one thing I'm getting hung up on.

38
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:09,640
<3-13,House>那就是我能来去自如
<3-13,House>I can leave whenever I want.

39
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,160
<3-13,House>先解决这个问题怎么样呢
<3-13,House>How about I start with that?

40
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,590
<3-14,Nolan>你不能回去行医
<3-14,Nolan>You can't go back to practicing medicine.

41
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,900
<3-15,House>我不想行医
<3-15,House>I don't want to practice medicine.

42
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,290
<3-15,House>我决定要做宇航员
<3-15,House>I've decided I want to be an astronaut.

43
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,910
<3-16,Nolan>如果你想拿国家宇航员执照的话
<3-16,Nolan>Well, if you want your state astronaut's license,

44
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,720
<3-16,Nolan>就需要我的推荐信
<3-16,Nolan>You're gonna need my recommendation.

45
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,200
<3-17,House>这是流行的新式疗法吗
<3-17,House>Is that a popular, new treatment

46
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:32,740
<3-17,House>敲诈吗
<3-17,House>Blackmail?

47
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:34,680
<3-18,Nolan>你要好起来
<3-18,Nolan>You need to get better.

48
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:42,480
<4-1,Orderly>欢迎来到六号病房
<4-1,Orderly>Welcome to Ward Six.

49
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:57,980
<4-1,Orderly>老实说要我来这干嘛
<4-1,Orderly>So brass tacks what do I have to do

50
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:59,520
<5-1,House>要呆在这里多久呢
<5-1,House>And how long do I have to be here?

51
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:02,780
<5-2,Beasley>这取决于你  疗程很简单
<5-2,Beasley>Depends on you. Process Is pretty basic.

52
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:05,630
<5-2,Beasley>如果你配合治疗  按时吃药
<5-2,Beasley>If you follow the schedule, agree to take meds

53
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,310
<5-2,Beasley>参与集体和个体治疗
<5-2,Beasley>Participate in group and individual therapy,

54
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:09,910
<5-3,House>-我们能为目标奋斗  -我定了一个目标
<5-3,House>- We can work on goals. - I set a goal.

55
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,490
<5-4,Beasley>很不错  是什么目标呢
<5-4,Beasley>Excellent. What is it?

56
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,150
<5-5,House>我的目标就是让你的老板
<5-5,House>My goal is to get your boss

57
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:14,890
<5-5,House>写那封我想要他写的推荐信
<5-5,House>To write the letter that I want him to write.

58
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:16,810
<5-5,House>来谈谈我们的疗程
<5-5,House>Now let's talk process.

59
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:19,330
<5-5,House>我能挤出灿烂笑容  也能对人友善
<5-5,House>I can smile through gritted teeth and play nice,

60
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:22,000
<5-5,House>但这么做我会冒着大开杀戒的风险
<5-5,House>But there are serious risks of violence involved in that choice,

61
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,340
<5-5,House>所以我选择大闹天宫
<5-5,House>So I'm going with turning this ward upside down,

62
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,260
<5-5,House>让你和你老板的工作和生活都苦不堪言
<5-5,House>Making you and your boss' job and life so unmanageable

63
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,600
<5-5,House>让他逼不得已给出一纸承诺来摆脱我
<5-5,House>That he'll write whatever he has to write to get rid of me.

64
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:32,120
<5-6,Safer>他的东西都准备好了
<5-6,Safer>He's all set.

65
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,260
<5-7,Beasley>谢谢
<5-7,Beasley>Thanks.

66
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,300
<6-1,Alvie>我不要保镖  滚开
<6-1,Alvie>Yo, I don't need an escort. Get off me.

67
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,310
<6-1,Alvie>你是谁
<6-1,Alvie>Who are you?

68
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:52,830
<6-1,Alvie>你相信这些家伙吗
<6-1,Alvie>You believe these guys?

69
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:54,290
<6-1,Alvie>逼我上躁狂抑郁症的课程
<6-1,Alvie>Lecturing me on manic depression,

70
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:55,840
<6-1,Alvie>好像我自己不能书一样
<6-1,Alvie>Like I couldn't write a book or two.

71
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:58,570
<6-1,Alvie>我停止服药药  因为我想停止服药
<6-1,Alvie>I stop taking my meds, because I want to stop taking my meds,

72
00:05:58,590 --> 00:05:59,870
<6-1,Alvie>因为我根本没病
<6-1,Alvie>Because nothing is wrong with me.

73
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,920
<6-1,Alvie>没理由把我拽回这里
<6-1,Alvie>No reason to keep dragging me back here.

74
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,310
<6-1,Alvie>如果开始吃药  一切都会放缓
<6-1,Alvie>When I'm on them, everything slows down.

75
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,500
<6-1,Alvie>那才是问题所在
<6-1,Alvie>That's when the problem is.

76
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,070
<6-1,Alvie>很高兴见到你
<6-1,Alvie>Hey, nice to see you.

77
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:08,440
<6-1,Alvie>我上个室友不能忍受我
<6-1,Alvie>My roommate last time couldn't stand me.

78
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:09,760
<6-1,Alvie>真的吗
<6-1,Alvie>Relly

79
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,770
<6-3,Alvie>我是胡安·阿瓦  胡瓦是我的艺名
<6-3,Alvie>I'm Juan Alvarez. J.A.'s my stage name.

80
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,670
<6-3,Alvie>不过这里的人都叫我阿瓦
<6-3,Alvie>But Alvie's what everybody around here calls me,

81
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:16,440
<6-3,Alvie>就像伍迪·艾伦在"安妮·霍尔"演的角色
<6-3,Alvie>Like the Woody Allen character in, uh, Annie Hall,

82
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,470
<6-3,Alvie>不过是波多黎各版本  也没那么神经质
<6-3,Alvie>But the Puerto Rican version and not as neurotic.

83
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,700
<6-3,Alvie>该怎么称呼你呢
<6-3,Alvie>So what do I call you?

84
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,580
<6-4,House>你这次才真的在等我回答

<7-1,Alvie>等等我
<7-1,Alvie>Hey, wait up.

87
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,720
<7-1,Alvie>我在这里跟每个人都熟透了
<7-1,Alvie>I've already got the whole place wired

88
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:35,960
<7-1,Alvie>所以能带你熟悉一下
<7-1,Alvie>So I'll give you the rundown.

95
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:47,440

<7-5,Alvie>别紧张  她不会叫的
<7-5,Alvie>Don't worry. She won't call you anything.

97

<7-5,Alvie>她已经有大概十年没开口说话了
<7-5,Alvie>She hasn't talked in, like, ten years or something.

<7-7,Alvie>You're also gonna come here to get your meds.

103
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:01,260
<7-8,House>我不用吃药
<7-8,House>I'm not on any meds.

104
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:02,620
<7-9,Alvie>你也不用吗  恭喜啊
<7-9,Alvie>You either? Good for you.

105
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,390
<7-9,Alvie>说我脑子转太快
<7-9,Alvie>Tell me my mind works too fast.

106
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,710
<7-9,Alvie>干嘛不说博尔特跑太快
<7-9,Alvie>Probably tell Usain Bolt he runs too fast.

107
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:07,990
<7-10,House>有人在吗
<7-10,House>Excuse me.

<7-10,House>我知道你们故意不理我  但是我的冰箱空了
<7-10,House>I know you're busy ignoring me, but my minibar is empty.

109
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,690
<7-11,Alvie>你觉得博尔特可以跳远吗
<7-11,Alvie>You think Bolt could do the long jump?

110
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:14,190
<7-11,Alvie>那项运动需要向前发展
<7-11,Alvie>That sport needs to evolve.

111
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:16,380
<7-11,Alvie>同样的世界纪录已经保持了二十年
<7-11,Alvie>Had the same world record for, like, 20 years.

112
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:19,040
<7-11,Alvie>我觉得如果一个人头朝前冲
<7-11,Alvie>I think if one guy launched himself headfirst

113
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:20,630
<7-11,Alvie>刚好在他落地之前
<7-11,Alvie>And right before he hits the ground

114
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:21,990
<7-11,Alvie>去做一个前翻
<7-11,Alvie>Does a front flip instead,

115
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:23,650
<7-11,Alvie>能轻易多跳出三米
<7-11,Alvie>Get three extra feet out of that, easy.

116
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:24,460
<7-12,House>你去创那个记录吧
<7-12,House>Go be that man.

<10-25,House>你从哪儿弄到钥匙的呢
<10-25,House>Where'd you get the key?

<10-32,Lydia>It bobs to the music.

236
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,130
<10-32,Lydia>这是她给我的唯一的回应
<10-32,Lydia>It's the only real reaction I'm getting from her.

237
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:12,300
<10-32,Lydia>就像我们在聊天
<10-32,Lydia>It feels like we're talking.

238
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:15,070
<10-33,House>你没在聊天
<10-33,House>You're not talking.

239
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:18,800
<10-33,House>她的头是随着脉搏点动
<10-33,House>Her head is bobbing to her pulse.

240
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:20,830
<10-34,Lydia>你是新来的医生吗
<10-34,Lydia>Are you a new doctor on the ward?

241
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,670
<10-35,House>技术上来书  是
<10-35,House>Technically, yes.

242
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:28,600
<10-36,House>这次能让我带路么
<10-36,House>Can I lead this time?

243
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,830
<10-38,House>你弹完了之后别锁盖子
<10-38,House>Leave the lid unlocked when you're done.

245
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:04,520
<10-39,House>你能随手关门吗
<10-39,House>Can you close the door?

246
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:06,320
<10-39,House>冷气都给你放走了
<10-39,House>You're letting all the cool air out.

247
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:13,160
<10-40,Beasley>如果你继续负隅顽抗的话
<10-40,Beasley>If you keep up this scorched-earth policy,

248
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,190
<10-40,Beasley>你的就要永远被关在这里
<10-40,Beasley>You're gonna end up living in this room.

249
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:17,020
<10-40,Beasley>准备采用新战略了吗
<10-40,Beasley>Are you ready to try another strategy,

250
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,450
<10-40,Beasley>还是想我把你丢在这里
<10-40,Beasley>Or do you want me to leave you in here?

251
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,290
<11-1,Alvie>二比一  我赢了  看  豪斯回来了
<11-1,Alvie>2-1, that's game. Hey, House is back.

<11-3,Alvie>Come on, I need some meat.

254
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:41,620
<11-3,Alvie>没人敢跟我玩了
<11-3,Alvie>I got no one left to play.

<11-5,Alvie>You can serve.

258
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,860
<11-6,House>对于我之前的所作所为我一直很愧疚
<11-6,House>I've had some time to think about the approach I've been taking.

259
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,690
<11-6,House>我在这里闷闷不乐
<11-6,House>I knew I'm unhappy here,

260
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,390
<11-6,House>而且我把怨气都撒在你们身上
<11-6,House>And I，I've been taking it out on you guys...

261
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:03,250
<11-6,House>这对你们不公平
<11-6,House>Unfairly.

262
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:05,280
<11-6,House>我那是...
<11-6,House>It was...

263
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:08,610
<11-6,House>迁怒于你们
<11-6,House>Misdirected anger.

264
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:12,610
<11-6,House>可仔细想想  这里真正的混蛋
<11-6,House>Cause when you think about it, the real jerks here...

265
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,180
<11-6,House>-应该是那些医生  -豪斯
<11-6,House>- Are the doctors. - House!

266
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,280
<11-7,Beasley>他们给你们乒乓球桌
<11-7,Beasley>See how they give you a ping-pong table,

267
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:21,710
<11-8,House>却没不给你们拍子和网
<11-8,House>But no paddles, no net?

268
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,110
<11-8,House>把你们当傻子耍
<11-8,House>It's like they're mocking you.

269
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,580
<11-9,Alvie>赞同
<11-9,Alvie>Preach!

270
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:27,480
<11-10,House>这是桌上网球  而非桌上排球
<11-10,House>The game is called table tennis, not table volleyball.

271
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,440
<11-11,Beasley>格雷戈  你明知会有结束的
<11-11,Beasley>Greg, you know where this is gonna end.

272
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:32,210
<11-12,House>有人见过没有网的网球场吗
<11-12,House>Who ever saw a tennis court without a net?

273
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:35,350
<11-13,Richter>我家对面的街头公园有三个网球场
<11-13,Richter>Little run-down park across from my apartment growing up

274
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:38,750
<11-13,Richter>没有网  从来就没人用
<11-13,Richter>Three courts, no nets. No one ever used it.

275
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:41,610
<11-14,House>我们才不会那球网上吊呢
<11-14,House>No one's gonna try to hang themselves with a ping-pong net

276
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,110
<11-15,Hal>-当然不会  -荒唐至极
<11-15,Hal>- Of course not. - Yeah, that's ridiculous.

277
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,880
<11-16,Alvie>医生你们有错  你们把我们当屁孩使唤
<11-16,Alvie>It ain't right, doc. You treat us like little kids.

278
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:46,610
<11-17,House>不对  屁孩都可以玩乒乓球
<11-17,House>No, little kids are allowed to play ping-pong,

279
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,380
<11-17,House>他们还能弹钢琴呢
<11-17,House>And they can play the piano.

280
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,380
<11-18,Richter>是啊  还比不上小屁孩呢
<11-18,Richter>Yeah, worse than little kids.

281
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,540
<11-19,Beasley>很好  我们不如先离开这里  坐下来
<11-19,Beasley>All right, why don't we just go and sit down

282
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:54,750
<11-20,Hal>-慢慢商量  -不  不
<11-20,Hal>- And discuss it? - No, no, no.

283
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:55,950
<11-20,Hal>我现在就要在这里商量
<11-20,Hal>No, I want to discuss it right here.

284
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:58,680
<11-21,Beasley>伙计们
<11-21,Beasley>Guys.

00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:02,870
<11-21,Beasley>伙计们
<11-21,Beasley>Guys

286
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:10,700
<11-21,Beasley>伙计们
<11-21,Beasley>Guys!

287
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:32,740
<11-23,Nolan>豪斯说得对
<11-23,Nolan>House is right.

288
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,470
<11-23,Nolan>我觉得大家都能应付这个
<11-23,Nolan>I think everyone here can handle these.

289
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:42,570
<11-24,House>开什么玩笑
<11-24,House>Seriously?

290
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,000
<11-24,House>那就是你的策略
<11-24,House>Is that your strategy

291
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,940
<11-24,House>除了我  让每个人都如愿以偿吗
<11-24,House>Give everybody what they want except me?

292
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,370
<11-25,Nolan>你是天生的领导
<11-25,Nolan>You're a natural leader.

293
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:51,000
<11-25,Nolan>你在这能有大作为
<11-25,Nolan>You could do something useful down here,

294
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:53,470
<11-25,Nolan>为了他们  也为了你自己
<11-25,Nolan>For them, definitely for you.

295
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:56,600
<11-25,Nolan>要么我们可以一直抗战下去
<11-25,Nolan>Or we could keep fighting...

296
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:58,240
<11-25,Nolan>要是你以为你能摧毁我
<11-25,Nolan>If you think you can break me,

297
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:02,360
<11-25,Nolan>要是你以为我没有你那么顽固
<11-25,Nolan>If you think I'm not every bit as stubborn as you.

298
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:19,460
<12-2,House>闭嘴
<12-2,House>Shut up.

299
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,060
<12-3,Alvie>你会继续让他们痛苦吗
<12-3,Alvie>So you gonna keep trying to make them miserable?

305
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,060
<12-10,House>在安静的环境下更容易想出新计划
<12-10,House>You know, it's easier to come up with a new plan in silence.

306
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:41,460
<12-11,Alvie>对  酷

00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:41,880
<13-13,Freedom Master>她为什么不说话呢
<13-13,Freedom Master>Why isn't she talking?

333
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,240
<13-13,Freedom Master>她需要帮助

340
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:09,790
<13-16,Beasley>离开这里的完美计划
<13-16,Beasley>Working on your next elaborate plan to get out of here.

341
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:13,990
<13-16,Beasley>为什么不先等几天
<13-16,Beasley>Why don't you put the plan on hold for a few days?

342
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:15,210
<13-16,Beasley>看会有什么结果呢

344
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:21,000
<13-16,Beasley>如果你喜欢个人活动而不是团体活动
<13-16,Beasley>If you prefer private to group, we can do that.

345
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,670
<13-16,Beasley>也行  或许可以吃些抗抑郁药
<13-16,Beasley>Maybe try some SSRIs.

346
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:25,050
<13-16,Beasley>如果觉得不见成效
<13-16,Beasley>If you think nothing's working,

347
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:26,410
<13-16,Beasley>你再施行你的惊天大计也不迟
<13-16,Beasley>You can always go back to your schemes.

00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:29,570
<13-17,House>你两分钟之前跟我说这些就好了
<13-17,House>God. If only you'd said that two minutes ago,

349
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,470
<13-17,House>刚好赶在我的新计划诞生之前
<13-17,House>Before I came up with my new scheme.

00:19:58,550 --> 00:19:59,970
<14-5,Alvie>酱料才是关键
<14-5,Alvie>I mean, the whole point is the dipping.

358
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,380
<14-5,Alvie>以前我们为图方便没有将酸奶雪糕混进去
<14-5,Alvie>Sure, we save time by not adding the mix and sour cream,

<19-8,House>Too old, and too well-dressed

436
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,850

00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:23,160
<19-8,House>他的生活有过不轨

00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:42,850
<19-11,Wilson>还告诉我如果我想让你好起来
<19-11,Wilson>And he told me if I wanted to help you get better,

446
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,590
<19-11,Wilson>就不能插手他的工作
<19-11,Wilson>I had to let him do his job.

00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,240
<21-4,House>他都焉了  阿瓦
<21-4,House>He's not confident, Alvie.

468
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:01,020
<21-4,House>用你的押韵句子盖过他
<21-4,House>Crush him, in the form of a rhyme if you want.

469
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,530
<21-5,Alvie>送烟舞会矣
<21-5,Alvie>No regrets return cigarette

470
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:06,030
<21-6,House>有只小二还下这么大注
<21-6,House>Whoa, that's a lot of nerve

471
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:07,830
<21-6,House>真是胆大包天啊
<21-6,House>For someone with a two on their head.

472
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:08,870
<21-7,Alvie>你休想蒙我
<21-7,Alvie>You're messing with me.

473
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,300
<21-8,Hal>你不能超过十  我只有五支烟
<21-8,Hal>You can't raise ten. I only have five.

474
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:12,700
<21-9,Alvie>出你的电话卡
<21-9,Alvie>Throw in your phone card.

475
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,350
<21-10,Hal>我才不会出我的电话卡
<21-10,Hal>I'm not gonna throw in my phone card.

476
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:15,630
<21-11,Diane>我可以玩吗
<21-11,Diane>Can I play?

477
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:18,450
<21-12,House>-过来  -干嘛
<21-12,House>- Come here. - Why?

478
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,400
<21-13,Diane>我看你够不够格
<21-13,Diane>I want to see if you've got what it takes.

479
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:22,840
<21-14,House>来张最凶的扑克脸
<21-14,House>Give me your best poker face.

480
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:27,280
<21-14,House>我挺不住了
<21-14,House>Too rich for my blood.

481
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:28,980
<21-14,House>你来替我吧
<21-14,House>You can take my seat.

482
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,600
<21-15,Safer>吃药时间到
<21-15,Safer>Med time!

483
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:34,060
<21-16,Safer>今天觉得怎么样
<21-16,Safer>How are you feeling today?

484
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:36,050
<21-17,House>比昨天好些  没有明天好
<21-17,House>Better than yesterday, not as good as tomorrow.

485
00:27:57,530 --> 00:27:58,480
<22-1,House>我给她哼过歌
<22-1,House>I've been humming to her.

486
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:01,010
<22-1,House>她随节奏摆动
<22-1,House>She sways.

487
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:02,880
<22-1,House>音乐可能真的有用
<22-1,House>It might be significant.

488
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,740
<22-1,House>你在装作无视我
<22-1,House>Are you ignoring me,

489
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,460
<22-1,House>还是已经被我迷得神魂颠倒了呢
<22-1,House>Or are you just letting my charm wash over you?

490
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,100
<22-2,Lydia>我不能边弹琴边聊天
<22-2,Lydia>Kind of tough to play and chat.

491
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,150
<22-2,Lydia>几星期前你跟我说
<22-2,Lydia>A couple of weeks ago, you told me

492
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,620
<22-2,Lydia>对她弹琴简直是浪费时间
<22-2,Lydia>Playing to her was a complete waste of time.

493
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:21,090
<22-2,Lydia>你说的没错
<22-2,Lydia>You're right.

494
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:22,750
<22-3,House>你真的不能边聊天边弹琴
<22-3,House>Your playing does get worse when you talk.

495
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,560
<22-3,House>我想她很喜欢音乐
<22-3,House>I assume she loved music.

496
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:29,060
<22-4,Lydia>她以前在费城交响乐团
<22-4,Lydia>She played for the Philadelphia Philharmonic...

497
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:30,730
<22-4,Lydia>弹奏大提琴
<22-4,Lydia>Cello.

498
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:32,590
<22-5,House>如果她对钢琴有反应
<22-5,House>Well, if she responded to the piano,

499
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:34,360
<22-5,House>大提琴效果应该更好
<22-5,House>She might respond even better to the cello.

500
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:36,720
<22-6,Lydia>我会拉一点点
<22-6,Lydia>I play a little.

501
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,190
<22-6,Lydia>或许星期二可以带过来
<22-6,Lydia>Maybe I'll bring one in Tuesday.

502
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:43,860
<36-9,Freedom Master>谢谢
<36-9,Freedom Master>Thank you.

503
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:51,530
<23-1,House>桌子变了  医生也变了
<23-1,House>Different desk, different doctor.

504
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,280
<23-2,Medina>你已经用药一段时间了
<23-2,Medina>You've been on meds for a while now.

505
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:54,730
<23-2,Medina>我要定期检查
<23-2,Medina>I'll be checking in with you periodically

506
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:56,550
<23-2,Medina>看是否需要调整剂量
<23-2,Medina>To see if we need to adjust your dose.

507
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:59,020
<23-2,Medina>有没有感觉口干或失眠
<23-2,Medina>Any dry mouth, trouble sleeping?

508
00:28:59,320 --> 00:28:59,920
<23-3,House>没有
<23-3,House>Nope.

509
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:02,030
<23-3,House>我可以走了吗
<23-3,House>Can I go now?

510
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:04,540
<23-3,House>有个躁狂病人拿着一盒烟在等我
<23-3,House>There's a manic out there with a fresh carton of cigarettes,

511
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,530
<23-3,House>还是个典型的吹牛大王
<23-3,House>And he's a terrible bluffer.

512
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,720
<23-4,Medina>很高兴看到你和阿瓦重归于好
<23-4,Medina>It's nice to see that you and Alvie are friends again.

513
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:11,420
<23-4,Medina>说说你们上次打的那一架
<23-4,Medina>Tell me about your fight.

514
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:12,980
<23-5,House>他打我  我揍回去
<23-5,House>He hit me. I hit him back.

515
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:15,190
<23-5,House>直到咱俩都筋疲力尽
<23-5,House>Repeat until pulpy.

516
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,670
<23-6,Medina>阿瓦说是你挑起来的
<23-6,Medina>Alvie told me you instigated the thing.

517
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:19,730
<23-7,House>大家不都是这样吗
<23-7,House>Well, that tends to be the way fights work

518
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:22,310
<23-7,House>公说公有理  婆说婆有理
<23-7,House>Different interpretations of the same circumstances.

519
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,850
<23-8,Medina>很通情达理啊
<23-8,Medina>Very understanding attitude.

520
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:25,240
<23-9,House>有来怪腔怪调了
<23-9,House>There's that tone again.

521
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,060
<23-10,Medina>你很聪明
<23-10,Medina>You're smart.

522
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:28,610
<23-11,House>为什么你每次在恭维我
<23-11,House>How come every time you compliment me,

523
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,380
<23-11,House>听上去都像是在指责我
<23-11,House>It sounds like an accusation?

524
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:33,390
<23-12,Medina>你吃了那么多药物却无副作用  这不正常
<23-12,Medina>You're not having any side effects from your meds, which Is unusual.

525
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:34,180
<23-13,House>哪有什么不正常
<23-13,House>It's not that unusual.

526
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,920
<23-14,Medina>你关于打架的说辞合情合理
<23-14,Medina>The story about the fight isn't adding up.

527
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:36,960
<23-15,House>别再假装好像
<23-15,House>Why don't you stop pretending

528
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:38,720
<23-15,House>你心中没有定论一样可以吗
<23-15,House>That you haven't reached a conclusion?

529
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,280
<23-15,House>你不信任我
<23-15,House>You don't trust me.

530
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,600
<23-15,House>事实上  你打心眼里讨厌我
<23-15,House>Actually, it's more fundamental than that. You don't like me.

531
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,610
<23-16,Medina>我可没说过
<23-16,Medina>I didn't say that.

532
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,240
<23-17,House>你认为我没吃药
<23-17,House>You think I'm not taking my meds.

533
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,390
<23-18,Medina>你吃了吗
<23-18,Medina>Are you?

534
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,560
<23-18,Medina>当然
<23-18,Medina>Yes.

535
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:50,610
<23-19,House>你到底想让我干什么
<23-19,House>So what do you want me to do?

536
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:52,060
<23-19,House>做个尿检吗
<23-19,House>Want me to take a urine test?

537
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:53,720
<23-19,House>这样能赢取你的信任吗
<23-19,House>Will that earn your trust?

538
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:55,930
<23-20,Medina>的确如此
<23-20,Medina>Actually, yeah.

539
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,050
<24-1,Medina>尿在里面
<24-1,Medina>Have at it.

540
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:11,780
<24-2,House>请给我留点尊严
<24-2,House>A little dignity, please.

541
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,260
<24-3,Medina>你知道规定  我必须监视
<24-3,Medina>You know the rules. I have to watch.

542
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,980
<24-4,House>可你大可不必抢占场边座位
<24-4,House>Yeah, but you don't have to have courtside seats.

543
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,370
<24-4,House>让我在隔间解决行吗
<24-4,House>Can I at least use a stall?

544
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,620
<24-4,House>趁热抓住了
<24-4,House>Get it while it's hot.

545
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:37,550
<24-4,House>我抱歉刚才怀疑你
<24-4,House>I'm sorry I doubted you.

546
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,680
<24-4,House>自由战士
<24-4,House>Freedom Master,

547
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,000
<24-4,House>能帮我个忙吗
<24-4,House>Think you could help me out?

548
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:45,820
<26-1,Medina>帮你忙吗
<26-1,Medina>You need help?

549
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:47,470
<26-2,Medina>当然
<26-2,Medina>Of course. That's

550
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:48,430
<26-3,Freedom Master>这就是我的职责
<26-3,Freedom Master>That's what I do.

551
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:49,160
<26-4,Medina>很好
<26-4,Medina>Great.

552
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:50,970
<26-4,Medina>可以帮我移走钢琴吗
<26-4,Medina>Could you move the piano for me?

553
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,550
<26-4,Medina>这琴才重五百磅  很轻的  不是吗
<26-4,Medina>it's 500 pounds. That's not too much, Is it?

554
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:57,590
<26-5,Freedom Master>你有东西落卡在钢琴下面还是怎样
<26-5,Freedom Master>Well, is there something trapped underneath or...?

555
00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:00,090
<26-6,Medina>没有  我只是想把它从窗户边移开
<26-6,Medina>No. I just want to move it away from the window.

556
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:02,480
<26-8,Medina>很抱歉  我的力气不足以移动钢琴
<26-8,Medina>I'm sorry my powers aren't for frivolous just one quick lift.

557
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:04,640
<26-9,House>你究竟想干什么
<26-9,House>Why are you doing that?

558
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,440
<26-10,Alvie>豪斯  这与你无关
<26-10,Alvie>House, it's none of your business.

559
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,040
<26-11,House>我很好奇
<26-11,House>I'm curious.

560
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:11,890
<26-11,House>作为一个医生  你到底在干什么
<26-11,House>As a doctor, what are you doing?

561
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:14,320
<26-12,Medina>如果他是自由战士的话  他就不必呆在这里
<26-12,Medina>Either he is Freedom Master, and he shouldn't be here,

562
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:17,230
<26-12,Medina>除非他有严重危险的妄想症
<26-12,Medina>Or else he's suffering from a serious and dangerous delusion

563
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:18,230
<26-12,Medina>他必须接受事实
<26-12,Medina>That he needs to deal with.

564
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:19,590
<26-12,Medina>那么
<26-12,Medina>So...

565
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:21,420
<26-13,House>这是合理的医学动机
<26-13,House>Legit medical reasons.

566
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,030
<26-13,House>你不会是仅仅因为他些许与众不同
<26-13,House>You're not just trying to break the guy

567
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,360
<26-13,House>就想让他崩溃吧
<26-13,House>Because he's a little different.

568
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:27,020
<26-14,Medina>他与常人无异  他只是有妄想症
<26-14,Medina>He's not different. He's delusional.

569
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,470
<26-15,Freedom Master>-你到底能不能帮我  -她在看什么
<26-15,Freedom Master>- Can you help me out? - What is she looking at?

570
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:32,040
<26-16,Medina>史蒂夫  你不是超级英雄
<26-16,Medina>You're not a superhero, Steven.

571
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,750
<26-17,Freedom Master>-你只是凡夫俗子  -我能救她
<26-17,Freedom Master>- You're just a regular person. - I can save her.

572
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,040
<26-18,Medina>没什么大不了的  我们都是凡夫俗子
<26-18,Medina>That's okay. We'rewe're all just regular people.

573
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:36,890
<26-18,Medina>我们都是这样
<26-18,Medina>It's what we do.

574
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:38,330
<26-19,Freedom Master>他们偷了她的音乐盒
<26-19,Freedom Master>They stole her voice box.

575
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,740
<26-19,Freedom Master>他们放在那里
<26-19,Freedom Master>They have it in there.

576
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:42,480
<26-19,Freedom Master>所以她才一直盯着那里
<26-19,Freedom Master>That's what she's staring at.

577
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:43,870
<26-19,Freedom Master>这就是她一直盯着的东西
<26-19,Freedom Master>That's what she's staring at.

578
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:45,920
<26-20,Medina>-她一直盯着  -你妻子已经走了
<26-20,Medina>- She's always staring. - Your wife is dead.

579
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,690
<26-21,Freedom Master>正义必将战胜邪恶
<26-21,Freedom Master>Good can defeat evil.

580
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:55,810
<26-22,Medina>并非永远如此
<26-22,Medina>Not every time.

581
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:57,610
<26-22,Medina>那天邪恶的人杀死了很多好人
<26-22,Medina>Evil people killed a lot of good people that day.

582
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:59,810
<26-22,Medina>你无力拯救你妻子  没人可以
<26-22,Medina>You couldn't save her. No one could save her.

583
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,110
<26-23,Freedom Master>就在那里
<26-23,Freedom Master>It's in there.

584
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:04,180
<26-25,Freedom Master>她的音乐在那里
<26-25,Freedom Master>Her voice is in there.

585
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:05,920
<26-25,Freedom Master>她的音乐在那里
<26-25,Freedom Master>Her voice is in there.

586
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,030
<26-25,Freedom Master>灰色警报
<26-25,Freedom Master>Code gray.

587
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,060
<26-25,Freedom Master>她的音乐在
<26-25,Freedom Master>Her voice is in

588
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:12,330
<26-25,Freedom Master>她的音乐在那里
<26-25,Freedom Master>Her voice is in there!

589
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:14,380
<26-25,Freedom Master>他的音乐在那里
<26-25,Freedom Master>Her voice is in there!

590
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:15,930
<26-25,Freedom Master>在那里啊
<26-25,Freedom Master>Is there

591
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:17,310
<26-25,Freedom Master>别
<26-25,Freedom Master>No!

592
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:20,970
<27-1,Alvie>千万别
<27-1,Alvie>Don't do it.

593
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,690
<27-2,House>我什么都没干
<27-2,House>I'm not doing anything.

594
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:23,980
<27-2,House>你在思考
<27-2,House>You're thinking.

595
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:27,550
<27-3,Alvie>在这个地方思考会一发不可收拾
<27-3,Alvie>Things go from thinking to doing way too fast in this place.

596
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,190
<27-3,Alvie>你继续想下去  你就会一无所有
<27-3,Alvie>You keep thinking, you're gonna wind up with no mo in your mojo.

597
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:31,500
<27-4,House>我想再揍你一顿
<27-4,House>I'm thinking of hitting you again.

598
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:33,680
<27-5,Alvie>你讨厌麦地那  你讨厌他们所有人
<27-5,Alvie>You hate Medina. You hate all of them.

599
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,530
<27-5,Alvie>你想让他们日子不好过
<27-5,Alvie>You want to hurt them.

600
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:36,980
<27-5,Alvie>但你得放下仇恨  继续假装合作
<27-5,Alvie>You got to keep pretending. Step away from the hate.

601
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:41,210
<27-6,House>假装的合作与真正的合作有什么不同
<27-6,House>What's the difference between pretending to cooperate and cooperating?

602
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:43,350
<27-7,Alvie>假装就是假装  不是真的
<27-7,Alvie>Pretending is pretending. It's not real.

603
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:44,140
<27-7,Alvie>你不是真的要合作
<27-7,Alvie>You don't mean it.

604
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,370
<27-8,House>我呆坐在那里看着他
<27-8,House>I sat and watched

605
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:47,560
<27-8,House>做些愚蠢至极且毫无意义的事
<27-8,House>While he did something stupid and pointless.

606
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:48,630
<27-8,House>我是配合了
<27-8,House>I cooperated.

607
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,330
<27-9,Alvie>过不了几天  你就不再需要这么做了
<27-9,Alvie>In a few days, you won't have to watch,

608
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:51,680
<27-9,Alvie>你就能回家了
<27-9,Alvie>Because you're going home.

609
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,490
<27-9,Alvie>你可以要回你的工作
<27-9,Alvie>You'll be getting your job back.

610
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,550
<27-10,Safer>大家都进来
<27-10,Safer>Everybody inside!

611
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,070
<27-10,Safer>欢送会要开始了
<27-10,Safer>Closing ceremonies.

612
00:33:57,090 --> 00:33:59,100
<27-10,Safer>人人都参加  有人要回家了
<27-10,Safer>Everyone attends. One of you is going home.

613
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:05,500
<28-1,Beasley>这个星期很棒
<28-1,Beasley>It's been a great week.

614
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:08,960
<28-1,Beasley>许多人都突飞猛进
<28-1,Beasley>Um, a number of you have made tremendous strides.

615
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:11,850
<28-1,Beasley>今天我们欢聚一堂祝贺
<28-1,Beasley>But today we're here to congratulate

616
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:12,750
<28-1,Beasley>苏珊
<28-1,Beasley>Susan.

617
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:18,540
<28-1,Beasley>我们为你骄傲
<28-1,Beasley>We're proud of her!

618
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,640
<28-1,Beasley>我们祝她一路走好
<28-1,Beasley>We wish her well, and we hope

619
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:23,860
<28-2,Everyone>而且一去不复返
<28-2,Everyone>To never see her again!

620
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:34,450
<28-3,Beasley>真漂亮  不是吗
<28-3,Beasley>Yeah, isn't it pretty?

621
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:38,440
<28-3,Beasley>比斯利医生  你愿意来切蛋糕吗
<28-3,Beasley>And, um, Dr. Beasley, do you want to cut the cake?

622
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:39,440
<28-4,House>当然  很乐意
<28-4,House>Yeah, I'll do that.

623
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:40,350
<28-4,House>好的
<28-4,House>Okay.

624
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:45,710
<28-4,House>自由战士在哪
<28-4,House>Where's Freedom Master?

625
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:47,670
<28-5,Medina>他不能来参加
<28-5,Medina>He isn't able to take part.

626
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,100
<28-6,House>滚出来
<28-6,House>Get out there.

627
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:01,790
<28-6,House>他们说人人都要参加
<28-6,House>They said everybody has to get out there.

628
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,660
<28-6,House>说话啊  开口啊
<28-6,House>Talk! Say something!

629
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:07,140
<28-7,Medina>豪斯医生  别烦他了
<28-7,Medina>Dr. House, leave him alone.

630
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:08,270
<28-8,House>你给他下药了吗
<28-8,House>Did you drug him?

631
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,480
<28-9,Medina>当然没有
<28-9,Medina>Of course I didn't drug him.

632
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:13,320
<28-10,House>他面无表情  这是典型的紧张症
<28-10,House>He's in flat affect. He's practically catatonic.

633
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:14,630
<28-11,Alvie>这里有蛋糕哦
<28-11,Alvie>Hey, we got cake.

634
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:16,200
<28-12,Medina>-他没事的  -双层巧克力哦
<28-12,Medina>- He's fine. - Double chocolate.

635
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:18,300
<28-13,Alvie>-好好吃哦  -别跟我说他没事
<28-13,Alvie>- Yummy, yummy. - Don't tell me that he's fine!

636
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:19,370
<28-14,House>是你干的好事
<28-14,House>You did this!

637
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,850
<28-14,House>他以前很正常
<28-14,House>He was functioning.

638
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:23,090
<28-15,Medina>-很开心  -他有妄想症
<28-15,Medina>- He was happy. - He was delusional.

639
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:23,760
<28-15,Medina>那又怎么样
<28-15,Medina>Yeah.

640
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:24,900
<28-16,House>他现在这样真的"好"多了
<28-16,House>He's way better off now.

641
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:25,980
<28-17,Nolan>豪斯医生
<28-17,Nolan>Dr. House...

642
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:27,900
<28-17,Nolan>我们谈谈
<28-17,Nolan>Let's talk.

643
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:36,120
<28-18,Alvie>思考坏事
<28-18,Alvie>Thinking sucks.

644
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,240
<29-1,House>我还没有权力生气吗
<29-1,House>I'm not allowed to get angry?

645
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:42,720
<29-1,House>他们在整他
<29-1,House>They screwed him up.

646
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,590
<29-1,House>还有在积分上
<29-1,House>And for the record...

647
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:47,530
<29-1,House>我比苏珊高两级
<29-1,House>I am two privilege levels above Susan,

648
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:49,390
<29-1,House>我和她的抑郁量分数也一样
<29-1,House>And I got the same depression-scale score.

649
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:50,390
<29-2,Nolan>每个病人都是不同的
<29-2,Nolan>Every patient is different.

650
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:51,390
<29-2,Nolan>与分数无关
<29-2,Nolan>It's not about scores

651
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:53,440
<29-3,House>-与等级也无关  -快乐就是快乐
<29-3,House>- And levels and... - Happiness is happiness.

652
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,150
<29-3,House>测试是测试  应对是应对
<29-3,House>The test is the test. Coping is coping.

653
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:56,990
<29-4,Nolan>-你以为你能应付自如  -当然
<29-4,Nolan>- And you think you're... - Absolutely!

654
00:35:58,330 --> 00:36:00,470
<29-5,House>我要解决更深层的问题
<29-5,House>I need to address some deeper issues,

655
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,880
<29-5,House>我能为门诊病人带来福音
<29-5,House>Which I can do on an outpatient basis.

656
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,190
<29-5,House>一周三小时可否
<29-5,House>Three hours a week?

657
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:05,700
<29-5,House>这仅仅是我的初步提议
<29-5,House>And that's just my opening offer.

658
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,200
<29-5,House>如果你想要商量的话  我很乐意
<29-5,House>If you want to counter, I'll likely fold.

659
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:07,910
<29-6,Nolan>不行
<29-6,Nolan>No.

660
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:10,190
<29-7,House>否定可不是辩论
<29-7,House>"No" is not an argument.

661
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:11,810
<29-7,House>你想挫败我吗
<29-7,House>Are you trying to frustrate me?

662
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:12,690
<29-8,Nolan>不是
<29-8,Nolan>No.

663
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,230
<29-9,House>又是否定吗
<29-9,House>"No" again?

664
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:17,120
<29-9,House>我能应对  我应对自如
<29-9,House>I can cope! I'm coping.

665
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:17,910
<29-9,House>事实上
<29-9,House>In fact...

666
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,950
<29-9,House>我应对能力比你所想要好得多
<29-9,House>I'm coping better than you think.

667
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:22,930
<29-9,House>我没有吃过你们开的药
<29-9,House>I've not been taking my meds,

668
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:24,510
<29-9,House>一颗也没有
<29-9,House>Not one.

669
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:28,450
<29-9,House>即便如此  我仍在你的忧虑度测试中得高分
<29-9,House>And yet, I still scored a "high functioning" on your depression test.

670
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:31,370
<29-10,Nolan>你用来证明你已经好了的证据就是谎言吗
<29-10,Nolan>So your proof of your well-being is that you lied?

671
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:32,360
<29-11,House>是操纵
<29-11,House>Manipulated.

672
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,120
<29-11,House>我要证明的是
<29-11,House>My proof is

673
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:36,000
<29-11,House>我能骗过测试  我能骗过你
<29-11,House>That I can fool the test, I can fool you,

674
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,390
<29-11,House>这就证明了我是一个很正常的人
<29-11,House>Which means I am high functioning.

675
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:39,340
<29-11,House>我神志清醒  意志健全  才华横溢
<29-11,House>I am sane, rational, capable.

676
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,590
<29-11,House>我不应该被关在这里
<29-11,House>I should not be here.

677
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:41,760
<29-12,Nolan>这是你今天要吃的药吗
<29-12,Nolan>These are your pills from today?

678
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:43,970
<29-13,House>我不会吃的
<29-13,House>I'm not gonna take it.

679
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,540
<29-13,House>我只会再次扔掉
<29-13,House>I'll just cheek it again.

680
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:49,900
<29-14,Nolan>舔舔吧
<29-14,Nolan>Lick it.

681
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,100
<29-15,House>你要我舔你的脏手吗
<29-15,House>You want me to lick your hand?

682
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:53,870
<29-16,Nolan>我洗过手了
<29-16,Nolan>I washed.

683
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,710
<29-17,House>是糖
<29-17,House>It's sugar.

684
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:03,430
<29-18,Nolan>你的测试结果
<29-18,Nolan>Your test results

685
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:04,800
<29-18,Nolan>进步得太有规律
<29-18,Nolan>Were improving too regularly

686
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:06,150
<29-18,Nolan>并且太过迅速
<29-18,Nolan>And too quickly.

687
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,420
<29-18,Nolan>我担心你没有用药
<29-18,Nolan>I was concerned that you weren't taking your pills,

688
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,380
<29-18,Nolan>担心这都是装出来的
<29-18,Nolan>That it was all an act,

689
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:11,850
<29-18,Nolan>所以我把你的药换成安慰剂
<29-18,Nolan>So I switched you to a placebo...

690
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,700
<29-18,Nolan>看你
<29-18,Nolan>To see if your...

691
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:17,720
<29-18,Nolan>能不能持续进步
<29-18,Nolan>Improvements would continue.

692
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:21,500
<29-18,Nolan>你的精神测试对我来说毫无反馈
<29-18,Nolan>Your psych tests told me nothing,

693
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,130
<29-18,Nolan>是你的尿液测试
<29-18,Nolan>But your urine tests

694
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:24,510
<29-18,Nolan>漏出了马脚
<29-18,Nolan>Told me you were faking.

695
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:28,590
<29-18,Nolan>你得停止与这里抗争
<29-18,Nolan>You need to stop fighting the system.

696
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:31,770
<29-18,Nolan>你得让我尽职尽责
<29-18,Nolan>You need to let me do my job.

697
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:39,290
<29-18,Nolan>所以
<29-18,Nolan>So...

698
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:40,200
<30-1,Alvie>你下一计划是什么呢
<30-1,Alvie>What's the next plan?

699
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:43,830
<30-2,House>没有新计划
<30-2,House>There is no new plan.

700
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,390
<30-2,House>我黔驴技穷了
<30-2,House>I'm out of plans.

701
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:49,020
<30-3,Alvie>那我们该做什么
<30-3,Alvie>So what do we do?

702
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:50,720
<30-4,House>别再说话
<30-4,House>We stop talking.

703
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:31,340
<31-1,House>我看见你车子后座有大提琴
<31-1,House>I see you've got some cello in your trunk.

704
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,140
<31-1,House>不该这么说  不够婉转
<31-1,House>And, no, that's not a euphemism.

705
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,500
<31-2,Lydia>你在监视我吗
<31-2,Lydia>Are you spying on me?

706
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:39,820
<31-3,House>我住在精神病院
<31-3,House>I'm living in a psychiatric hospital.

707
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:41,910
<31-3,House>我们唯一能做的就是眺望
<31-3,House>Staring out of the window is what we do.

708
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,880
<31-3,House>我还以为你要人帮忙能把它搬上来
<31-3,House>I assume you'll need help carrying it up.

709
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:47,010
<31-3,House>我还是有去楼下的特权
<31-3,House>I still got grounds privileges.

710
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:50,670
<31-4,Lydia>如果你去搬大提琴的话  谁来搬你
<31-4,Lydia>And who's going to carry you when you're carrying the cello?

711
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:53,750
<31-5,House>那是  把一个无用的跛子撇在一边
<31-5,House>Yes, cast aside the useless cripple

712
00:38:53,850 --> 00:38:55,210
<31-5,House>真像德国佬
<31-5,House>How very German of you.

713
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:58,770
<31-6,Lydia>说真的  那东西加上箱子有一吨重
<31-6,Lydia>Seriously, the thing weighs a ton with that case.

714
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,090
<31-6,Lydia>我想我需要个手推车
<31-6,Lydia>I think I'll need a dolly.

715
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:03,330
<31-7,House>或者可以让超人先生把它弄进去
<31-7,House>Or we could ask Clark Kent to pitch in.

716
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:05,640
<31-8,Lydia>手推车比较好办
<31-8,Lydia>The dolly's probably easier.

717
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:07,000
<31-9,House>手推车那家伙
<31-9,House>Eh, the dolly...

718
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:08,860
<31-9,House>已经自我感觉良好了
<31-9,House>Already feels good about itself.

719
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,610
<31-9,House>他本是个无忧无虑的超级英雄
<31-9,House>He was a happy-go-lucky superhero

720
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,370
<31-9,House>直到有人跟他说  他没有超能力
<31-9,House>Until they told him he has no powers.

721
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,060
<31-9,House>我们让他帮忙  他会好很多
<31-9,House>We let him help out, he feels good about himself.

722
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:17,710
<31-9,House>可能不会那么沮丧
<31-9,House>Might be less depressed.

723
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,430
<32-1,House>为什么你把自己的生命耽误在
<32-1,House>Why do you put your life on hold

724
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:26,010
<32-1,House>每星期花五天来看你家小姑子呢
<32-1,House>To visit your sister-in-law five times a week?

725
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,280
<32-2,Lydia>我像是一个冷漠无情的坏人吗
<32-2,Lydia>Am I somehow a bad person for showing compassion?

726
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:30,170
<32-2,Lydia>不像
<32-2,Lydia>No.

727
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:33,110
<32-3,House>你是一个连说谎都不会的坏人
<32-3,House>You're not even a bad person for lying about why you're doing it.

728
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:37,500
<32-3,House>好厉害哦
<32-3,House>Oh, that is impressive.

729
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:40,700
<32-3,House>好一双超级金刚腿
<32-3,House>That is a superhuman feat.

730
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:46,500
<32-3,House>你为什么不在飞回病房前先歇歇呢
<32-3,House>Why don't you take a rest before you fly that thing up to the ward?

731
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:53,630
<32-3,House>他还是很沮丧
<32-3,House>He's still depressed.

732
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:55,610
<32-3,House>把你车钥匙给我
<32-3,House>Give me your car keys.

733
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,490
<32-4,Lydia>你要拿钥匙在他面前晃一晃来逗他吗
<32-4,Lydia>You gonna dangle them in front of him to entertain him?

734
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:00,040
<32-5,House>我想给他飞翔的感觉
<32-5,House>I'm gonna make him feel like he's flying.

735
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,310
<32-5,House>我只是想载他兜兜风  从斜坡上冲下来
<32-5,House>I'll just drive him around the grounds, top down,

736
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:03,120
<32-5,House>让风吹拂他的秀发
<32-5,House>Wind in his hair.

737
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,530
<32-5,House>说真的
<32-5,House>Seriously...

738
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:08,670
<32-5,House>连这个你都能抗拒吗
<32-5,House>You're gonna say no to that?

739
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:23,990
<33-1,House>你为什么对我那么好
<33-1,House>Why are you so nice to me?

740
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:28,200
<33-2,Lydia>我觉得你心地善良
<33-2,Lydia>I think you have a good heart.

741
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:31,130
<33-3,House>如果我说我是撒谎的你仍会对我好吗
<33-3,House>Would you still be nice to me if I told you that I lied?

742
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,730
<33-3,House>我并不仅仅是要你的敞篷车兜兜风
<33-3,House>I'm not just driving around the grounds in your convertible

743
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,500
<33-3,House>而是在绑架他  还要抢你的车
<33-3,House>I'm kidnapping him and stealing your car.

744
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:43,910
<33-3,House>你确定吗
<33-3,House>You sure?

745
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:46,800
<33-3,House>我才觉得我们擦出火花
<33-3,House>I was just starting to feel a little heat between us.

746
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:49,370
<34-1,House>觉得咱们有点像《雌雄大盗》的男女主角
<34-1,House>Thought we had kind of a "Bonnie and Clyde" thing going there.

747
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:51,600
<34-2,Lydia>他俩最后被乱枪打死
<34-2,Lydia>Bonnie and clyde get shot to pieces.

748
00:40:52,610 --> 00:40:53,960
<34-3,House>再见
<34-3,House>Hmm. see you.

749
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:17,720
<34-3,House>你能行的
<34-3,House>You can do this.

750
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,990
<35-1,Freedom Master>紧握我的手  我也能做到
<35-1,Freedom Master>If you hold my hand, I can do it too.

751
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:53,240
<35-2,House>别放手
<35-2,House>Don't let go!

752
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:56,380
<35-3,Freedom Master>再飞高点
<35-3,Freedom Master>Going up!

753
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:11,830
<36-2,House>自由战士回来啦
<36-2,House>Freedom Master's back!

00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,810
<36-3,Freedom Master>降落吧  自由战士
<36-3,Freedom Master>Keep it down, Freedom Master.

755
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:17,550
<36-4,House>你把平民百姓吓着了
<36-4,House>You're scaring the good citizens.

756
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:19,880
<36-5,Freedom Master>这是我一生中最美妙的时刻
<36-5,Freedom Master>That was the coolest moment of my life.

757
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:20,670
<36-6,House>是很好玩
<36-6,House>It was fun.

758
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:23,920
<36-6,House>你可以骂诺兰是白痴来报答我
<36-6,House>You can repay me by telling Nolan he's an idiot.

759
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:25,720
<36-7,Freedom Master>呼吸清新的空气
<36-7,Freedom Master>Smell that fresh air

760
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:27,760
<36-7,Freedom Master>还有享受金色阳光的温暖
<36-7,Freedom Master>And the warmth of your yellow sun.

761
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:28,690
<36-8,House>我们确实很尽兴
<36-8,House>We do enjoy it.

762
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:31,900
<36-8,House>得小心开车
<36-8,House>Careful of the traffic.

763
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,820
<36-8,House>我不想撞坏栏杆
<36-8,House>Don't go damaging any fenders.

764
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:40,440
<36-8,House>别这样  快下来
<36-8,House>Come on, get down.

00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:43,830
<36-8,House>没有人喊救命
<36-8,House>There's no cry for help.

766
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:45,320
<36-8,House>没有小猫卡在树上
<36-8,House>There's no cat in a tree.

<37-1,Nolan>你一生都在寻求真相
<37-1,Nolan>Everything in your life has been about finding the truth.

774
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:17,590
<37-1,Nolan>可突然  你对他
<37-1,Nolan>But suddenly, with this guy,

775
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,120
<37-1,Nolan>你要加剧这个病人的妄想
<37-1,Nolan>You decide to reinforce a sick man's delusions.

<37-1,Nolan>你只想用他来打击我  对吧
<37-1,Nolan>You just wanted to take a swing at me, hmm?
