1
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:11,820
<1-1,Brandy>这录音室真不错
<1-1,Brandy>This is a really nice room.

2
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,200
<1-2,Tommy>那是 声音够浑厚  可惜请不到他
<1-2,Tommy>Yeah, it sounds thick. Too bad he's not coming.

3
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,280
<1-3,Brandy>-我亲口跟他谈的  他会来的  -是啊
<1-3,Brandy>- Look, I talked to him myself. He'll be here.  - Right.

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,180
<1-4,Tommy>是你说要加段小号和声
<1-4,Tommy>You're the one who said that the song

5
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:21,620
<1-5,Brandy>我才请来独一无二的约翰·亨利
<1-5,Brandy>could use a horn part, so I got the best-- John Henry.

6
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:24,740
<1-7,Brandy>-得了吧你  -真的  不过不重要
<1-7,Brandy>- You think I'm stupid?  - Of course I do, but that's not the point.

7
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:26,540
<1-7,Brandy>他一定会来的  好吧
<1-7,Brandy>He'll be here, okay?

8
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:36,280
<2-1,John>左转直走
<2-1,John>Take a left up ahead.

9
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:39,680
<2-2,Cora>去南街吗  那通告我取消了
<2-2,Cora>South Street? I canceled this gig.

10
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:42,710
<2-2,Cora>你说这阵子不想接任何通告的
<2-2,Cora>You said you didn't want to do any sessions for a while.

11
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,680
<2-3,John>那是前阵子  我电话联系过  接下了
<2-3,John>For a while. I called her. I uncanceled it.

12
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:48,900
<2-4,Cora>-能应付吗  -试试就知道
<2-4,Cora>- Are you up to it?  - Let's find out.

13
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,120
<2-4,Cora>你骗我
<2-4,Cora># You lied to me #

14
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:56,940
<3-1,Tommy>约翰·亨利决不会出现
<3-1,Tommy># John Henry's never gonna show up ##

15
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,520
<3-2,Brandy>你有完没完
<3-2,Brandy>Will you stop?

16
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,540
<3-3,Tommy>-都等了两小时了  -那也得继续等
<3-3,Tommy>- It's been, like, two hours. - And we will keep waiting.

17
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:04,280
<3-4,Brandy>你听过他的演奏  知道他的境界
<3-4,Brandy>You've heard this guy play, and you know what he does,

18
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:05,530
<3-4,Brandy>能闭嘴了吧  汤米
<3-4,Brandy>so can you just shut up, Tommy?

19
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:12,070
<3-4,Brandy>-天哪  -我来晚了吗
<3-4,Brandy>- Oh, my God.  - Am I late?

20
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,830
<4-1,Brandy>-需要再听一遍吗  -不用  可以了
<4-1,Brandy>- You need to hear it again?   - Nope. I get it.

21
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:27,930
<4-2,John>试一遍吧  看看效果  开始吧
<4-2,John>Let's try one. See what we get. Let's do it.

22
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,530
<4-3,Cora>约翰  你没事吧
<4-3,Cora>John! You okay?

23
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:07,040
<4-4,John>-你没事吧  -我喘不过气来  喘不过气
<4-4,John>- You okay?  - I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

24
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,610
<4-5,Cora>叫救护车
<4-5,Cora>Call an ambulance!

25
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:11,370
<4-5,Cora>快
<4-5,Cora>Now!

26
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:00,780
<4-5,Cora>我要入伙
<4-5,Cora>I want in.

27
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,260
<5-1,House>约翰·亨利·贾尔斯吗  你是他乐迷?
<5-1,House>John Henry Giles? You a fan of his music?

28
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:06,110
<5-2,Cuddy>他是音乐人?
<5-2,Cuddy>He's a musician?

29
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:10,980
<5-3,House>瘫痪嘛  两年都不良于行
<5-3,House>That paralysis thing-- Guy can't walk for two years.

30
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:13,130
<5-3,House>一直无法确诊  有点儿意思
<5-3,House>Nobody knows why. It seems mildly interesting.

31
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,100
<5-4,Cuddy>别提他的瘫痪
<5-4,Cuddy>Forget his paralysis.

32
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,650
<5-5,House>这话你该对他保龄球队球友说
<5-5,House>Tell that to the rest of his bowling team.

33
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,770
<5-6,Cuddy>就本院而言
<5-6,Cuddy>As far as this hospital is concerned,

34
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:21,200
<5-6,Cuddy>只是例单纯大叶性肺炎  没难度的
<5-6,Cuddy>this is a simple case of lobar pneumonia. Boring.

35
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:22,390
<5-7,House>但他的瘫痪
<5-7,House>But that not-walking thing

36
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,970
<5-7,House>真可能会有严重后果
<5-7,House>That could turn into something serious.

37
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:28,220
<5-8,Cuddy>加州的马蒂·汉密尔顿  才是他的主治医师
<5-8,Cuddy>Marty Hamilton is his primary physician out in California.

38
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,410
<5-8,Cuddy>他在治疗病人的瘫痪
<5-8,Cuddy>He's dealing with the paralysis.

39
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:32,250
<5-9,House>我懂  治疗复治疗  手术再手术
<5-9,House>Know all about it. Multiple treatments, multiple surgeries--

40
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,980
<5-9,House>他一直都在好转  除了他的腿  包治百病
<5-9,House>He's making real progress. Fixed everything but the legs.

41
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:37,260
<5-10,Cuddy>汉密尔顿医生已经打过电话  请你们小组帮忙
<5-10,Cuddy>Dr. Hamilton already called and asked for your team.

42
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,440
<5-10,Cuddy>是你们小组  不是你
<5-10,Cuddy>And by team, I don't mean you.

43
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:43,250
<5-11,House>我知道  团队里不能有自我意识
<5-11,House>Like I always say, there's no "I" In team.

44
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,750
<5-11,House>即使有我  也不能喧宾夺主
<5-11,House>There is a "Me" though, if you jumble it up.

45
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:49,000
<5-12,Cuddy>福曼实习期间跟过汉密尔顿
<5-12,Cuddy>Foreman did his residency with Hamilton.

46
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,670
<5-13,House>我知道  聘用他前我瞄过一眼简历
<5-13,House>I know. I accidentally glanced at his resume before I hired him.

47
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,360
<5-14,Cuddy>他要找自己信得过的人
<5-14,Cuddy>He wants someone he can trust.

48
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:56,270
<5-15,House>他肯定找福曼的假释官谈过了
<5-15,House>He must've spoken to Foreman's parole officer.

49
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:59,140
<5-16,Cuddy>一个可以单纯治疗肺炎的医生
<5-16,Cuddy>Someone who will stick to the pneumonia.

50
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:01,690
<5-16,Cuddy>约翰·亨利的瘫痪治疗尚在论证阶段
<5-16,Cuddy>John Henry's on an experimental protocol for the paralysis.

51
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:05,420
<5-17,House>-我尊重他的意见  我不会乱插一脚的  -福曼负责这病人
<5-17,House>- I respect that. I'm not gonna get in his way. - It's Foreman's case.

52
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:07,790
<5-18,Cuddy>就治个肺炎  他能行的
<5-18,Cuddy>It's pneumonia. He can handle it.

53
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:11,120
<5-19,House>都瘫痪了  也坏不到哪儿去了
<5-19,House>Guy's already paralyzed. How badly can he screw it up?

54
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,630
<6-1,Foreman>那么
<6-1,Foreman>So,

55
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,930
<6-2,Chase>-血氧浓度多少  -插鼻管后维持在90
<6-2,Chase>- What are his SATs? - Staying in the 90s on the nasal cannula.

56
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:34,850
<6-4,Cameron>-咳嗽有痰吗  -几乎没有  情况稳定
<6-4,Cameron>- Coughing up sputum? - Almost none. He seems stabilized.

57
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,380
<6-5,Foreman>豪斯医生  小动作给您启发了吗
<6-5,Foreman>Dr. House, is there anything back from micro?

58
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,730
<6-6,House>还没  要炒我吗
<6-6,House>Not yet. You gonna fire me?

59
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:42,310
<6-7,Foreman>-帮我洗洗车  这事儿就过去了  -挺冷的
<6-7,Foreman>- You can make up for it by washing my car. - Oh, this is fun.

60
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,940
<6-9,Foreman>好了  继续给他用广谱抗生素
<6-9,Foreman>Okay. Let's keep him on the broad-spectrum antibiotics.

61
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:47,110
<6-9,Foreman>既然他有感染症状
<6-9,Foreman>And since he's displaying septic physiology,

62
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,060
<6-9,Foreman>给他抽血做肾上腺和甲状腺功能检测
<6-9,Foreman>draw blood for adrenal and thyroid function.

63
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,000
<6-11,Foreman>-那瘫痪呢  -咱们只负责治疗肺炎
<6-11,Foreman>- What about the paralysis? - We're sticking to the pneumonia.

64
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,770
<6-12,House>当然  老大
<6-12,House>Well, you certainly are, boss,

65
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,960
<6-12,House>您可是一言既出  八匹马也难追
<6-12,House>like a wet tongue sticks to dry ice.

66
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:01,600
<6-13,Foreman>汉密尔顿医生已经确诊了他的瘫痪
<6-13,Foreman>The paralysis has already been diagnosed by Dr. Hamilton.

68
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:03,870
<6-14,House>-是肌萎缩性脊髓侧索硬化症  -路格里克氏病
<6-14,House>- It's A.L.S. - Lou Gehrig's disease.

70
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,340
<6-14,House>诊断过程很有趣  还拍了部电影的
<6-14,House>It's a lovely diagnosis. They make movies about it.

71
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:09,730
<6-14,House>未作检测谈何治疗  只能用排除法确诊
<6-14,House>No tests, no treatment-- It's a disease of exclusion.

72
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,540
<6-15,Foreman>-汉密尔顿已经排除了其他任何可能  -我没有
<6-15,Foreman>- Because Hamilton has excluded everything else. - I haven't.

73
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:18,520
<6-16,House>还可能是什么呢
<6-16,House>What else could it be?

74
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,480
<6-17,Chase>-格林-巴利综合症  病程是可逆的  -很好
<6-17,Chase>- Guillain-Barr? Which would be reversible. - Excellent.

75
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:26,720
<6-18,House>不对  那瘫痪应该是对称恶化的  他的不是
<6-18,House>No. The progression of the paralysis would be symmetric. His wasn't.

76
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:29,390
<6-20,Cameron>-横贯性脊髓炎  -汉密尔顿检测过了  阴性
<6-20,Cameron>- Transverse myelitis. - Hamilton tested for it. Negative.

77
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:31,380
<6-21,Foreman>同时否定了恶性肿瘤和动静脉畸型
<6-21,Foreman>And he was negative for Masses and A.V.M.

78
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:32,880
<6-22,Chase>抗体可能正在破坏神经系统
<6-22,Chase>Antibodies could be attacking the nerves.

79
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:35,760
<6-22,Chase>-多灶性运动神经症  -不常见  但症状相符
<6-22,Chase>- Multifocal motor neuropathy. - Uncommon, but it fits.

80
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:36,870
<6-23,House>也是可治愈的
<6-23,House>It's also treatable.

81
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,270
<6-23,House>汉密尔顿试过用免疫球蛋白治疗吗
<6-23,House>Did Hamilton try putting the guy on I.V.I.G.?

82
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,830
<6-24,Foreman>没有  因为核磁共振结果显示...
<6-24,Foreman>No, because the M.R.I. Showed no--

83
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:42,190
<6-25,House>那就再做一次
<6-25,House>Well, let's do an M.R.I. of our own.

84
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:48,750
<6-26,Foreman>各位  这是我的病人
<6-26,Foreman>Guys, it's my case.

85
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,570
<6-26,Foreman>症状与A.L.S.相符  肺炎也正是其并发症之一
<6-26,Foreman>A.L.S. Fits. It even predicts the pneumonia.

86
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,370
<6-26,Foreman>说明瘫痪症状在恶化
<6-26,Foreman>The paralysis is progressive.

87
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,550
<6-27,House>-这可是不治之症  -但这并不意味着是误诊
<6-27,House>- It's a death sentence. - That doesn't make it wrong.

88
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:20,560
<7-1,John>你觉得呼吸衰竭是A.L.S.引发的吗
<7-1,John>So you think the breathing stuff is connected to my A.L.S.?

89
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,100
<7-2,Foreman>有这种可能
<7-2,Foreman>It makes sense.

90
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,240
<7-3,John>病情恶化了  是吗
<7-3,John>So it's just gonna get worse, huh?

91
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,710
<7-4,Foreman>-汉密尔顿医生他...  -他人不错
<7-4,Foreman>- Well, Dr. Hamilton... - Great guy.

92
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:32,190
<7-5,John>是位好医生  但显然他的治疗不起作用
<7-5,John>Really smart doctor, and his treatment obviously isn't working.

93
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:35,740
<7-5,John>你觉得我会死在这里
<7-5,John>Do you think I'm gonna die here,

94
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,630
<7-5,John>还是能先回趟家
<7-5,John>or you think I get to go back home first?

95
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,550
<7-6,Foreman>核磁共振能让我们更好了解病情...
<7-6,Foreman>An M.R.I. would give us a better idea...

96
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,770
<7-7,John>核磁共振  拜托  这只是肺炎
<7-7,John>An M.R.I. Come on. For pneumonia?

97
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:44,610
<7-8,Foreman>-豪斯医生认为该考虑其他...  -豪斯
<7-8,Foreman>- Dr. House thinks we should test for other... - House?

98
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,270
<7-9,John>听说过  那个有强迫症的混蛋
<7-9,John>Yeah, I heard about him. Obsessive son of a bitch?

99
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,540
<7-10,Foreman>正是
<7-10,Foreman>That's him.

100
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,800
<7-11,John>你赞同谁  汉密尔顿还是豪斯
<7-11,John>So who do you think is right, Hamilton or House?

101
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:57,500
<7-12,Foreman>两位都是杰出的内科医生
<7-12,Foreman>Hey, they're both excellent physicians.

102
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,330
<7-12,Foreman>少来了
<7-12,Foreman>Come on.

103
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:02,980
<7-13,John>一个说是A.L.S  另一个说不是
<7-13,John>One of 'em says A.L.S. The other one says not A.L.S.

104
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:04,710
<7-13,John>非此即彼  小子
<7-13,John>You gotta pick one, son.

105
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,470
<7-14,Foreman>症状显示是A.L.S
<7-14,Foreman>Everything points to A.L.S.

106
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,000
<7-15,John>那就不做核磁共振
<7-15,John>Then no M.R.I.

107
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,740
<7-15,John>我想签署份文件
<7-15,John>And I want one of them papers that say,

108
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:19,920
<7-15,John>一旦病情恶化  就放弃治疗
<7-15,John>I don't want nothing done if something go bad.

109
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:24,270
<7-16,Foreman>签D.N.R吗  贾尔斯先生  不必这么仓促决定...
<7-16,Foreman>A D.N.R.? Mr. Giles, you don't want to rush into--

110
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:27,320
<7-17,John>已经两年了  不仓促  我心意已决
<7-17,John>It's been two years. I ain't rushin'. I want to sign one.

111
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:30,870
<7-17,John>现在就签
<7-17,John>Now.

112
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,450
<7-17,John>趁我的胳膊还能动
<7-17,John>While my arm still works.

113
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,320
<8-1,Foreman>他签了D.N.R.协议
<8-1,Foreman>He signed a D.N.R.

114
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,280
<8-2,House>他用晚餐写了一首歌
<8-2,House>He rhymes with dinner?

115
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:08,890
<8-1,Foreman>他签了D.N.R.协议
<8-1,Foreman>He signed a D.N.R.

116
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,980
<8-4,House>这话听着通多了
<8-4,House>That makes more sense.

117
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:16,280
<8-4,House>-你跟他说了  可能不是A.L.S.吗  -没有
<8-4,House>- You tell him it might not be A.L.S.? - No.

118
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:19,680
<8-6,House>怪不得他会签  谁不会呢
<8-6,House>Well, no wonder he signed. Who wouldn't?

119
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:22,770
<8-7,Foreman>开始给他静脉滴注类固醇和甲状腺素
<8-7,Foreman>I started him on I.V. Steroids and Synthroid.

120
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,410
<8-8,House>很好  如果是我的病人
<8-8,House>Great. If it was my case,

121
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,490
<8-8,House>我还会给他加免疫球蛋白
<8-8,House>I'd be adding a little I.V.I.G. to the mix.

122
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,950
<8-10,House>-治肺炎吗  -我的病人  我说了算
<8-10,House>- For his pneumonia? - That's my story, and I'm sticking to it.

123
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,830
<8-11,Foreman>他不想再做什么检测  放弃治疗了
<8-11,Foreman>He doesn't want anything done. No treatment.

124
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:39,140
<8-12,House>D.N.R.是指不予抢救  不是不予治疗
<8-12,House>D.N.R. Means "Do not resuscitate", not "Do not treat".

125
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:42,870
<8-12,House>什么都不做  我俩谁对都没有意义
<8-12,House>You do nothing, doesn't matter which one of us is right.

126
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,820
<8-12,House>那份D.N.R.可保存好了
<8-12,House>And hang on to that D.N.R.

127
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,680
<8-12,House>他的签名很快就会值一大笔钱
<8-12,House>That signature could be worth a lot of money real soon.

128
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,090
<9-1,Foreman>我是福曼医生  贾尔斯先生情况如何
<9-1,Foreman>This is Dr. Foreman. What is Mr. Giles's status?

129
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:05,050
<9-1,Foreman>好  类固醇用量增加到每12小时100毫克  还有...
<9-1,Foreman>Okay. Increase the steroids to 100 milligrams every 12 hours and, uh--

130
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:07,450
<9-1,Foreman>开始注射免疫球蛋白
<9-1,Foreman>start him on I.V.I.G.

131
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,550
<9-1,Foreman>对  我确定  剂量为体重的千分之一
<9-1,Foreman>Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure. One gram per kilo.

132
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:14,360
<9-1,Foreman>我最近雄风不再
<9-1,Foreman>My nature isn't what it used to be.

133
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:17,500
<9-1,Foreman>小家伙最近有点力不从心
<9-1,Foreman>The little man has lost some bounce in his step.

134
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,330
<10-1,Willie>他要好好发动发动  周末出去找点乐子
<10-1,Willie>He needs to crank it up, have himself some fun this weekend.

135
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,090
<10-1,Willie>他想来几颗蓝色的小药丸
<10-1,Willie>He wants the blue pills.

136
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,950
<10-2,House>你在用第三人称称呼你的老二
<10-2,House>You're taking about your penis in the third person.

137
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,990
<10-3,Willie>我和他  完全两个人
<10-3,Willie>Me and him-- two people.

138
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:31,440
<10-4,House>各行其事吗  确实有必要用药
<10-4,House>Separate vacations? That'd be a drag for one of you.

139
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,370
<10-4,House>但不是蓝色小药丸
<10-4,House>I don't think you need the pills.

140
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:35,450
<10-4,House>你用药有问题
<10-4,House>I think you have a conflict in medications.

141
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,110
<10-4,House>需要把胰岛素用量
<10-4,House>You need to up your insulin

142
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:40,270
<10-4,House>-增加到吃巧克力冰激凌一样多  -胰岛素?
<10-4,House>- to chocolate chip ice-cream levels. - Insulin?

143
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:43,230
<10-6,House>对  你知道的  糖尿病人该吃的那种
<10-6,House>Yeah. You remember. That's the stuff you take for the diabetes...

144
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,620
<10-6,House>而你显然忘记跟护士说这病史
<10-6,House>that you forgot to tell the nurse about.

145
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,770
<10-6,House>你的手
<10-6,House>Your hands--

146
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:50,740
<10-6,House>没有汗毛  说明神经损伤
<10-6,House>No hair, which means nerve damage.

147
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:53,470
<10-6,House>你的鞋子  起码小了两号
<10-6,House>And your shoes look about two sizes too small,

148
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:55,570
<10-6,House>说明你脚部已失去知觉
<10-6,House>which means you've lost sensation in your feet.

149
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:57,800
<10-6,House>然后还有你的裤子
<10-6,House>And then there's your pants.

150
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,740
<10-7,Willie>裤子告诉你我有糖尿病吗
<10-7,Willie>My pants tell you I have diabetes?

151
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,160
<10-8,House>不  说明你是个白痴
<10-8,House>No. They tell me you're an idiot.

152
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,630
<10-8,House>右边裤腿上有糖粉
<10-8,House>Powdered sugar on the right pant leg.

153
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,900
<10-8,House>加上你裤兜里那两张餐巾纸
<10-8,House>Based on the two napkins in your pocket--

154
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:09,260
<10-8,House>我敢说你今天已经吃了不止一个甜甜圈
<10-8,House>I'd bet it's not your first doughnut of the day.

155
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:11,260
<10-8,House>紧急抢救  约翰·亨利·贾尔斯  324病房
<10-8,House>Code Blue: John Henry Giles RM 324

156
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:20,950
<10-9,Willie>-你给我开伟哥了  -对  干嘛不开
<10-9,Willie>- You're giving me the pills?  - Sure. Why not?

157
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:22,870
<10-10,House>要是再不注意而引起了心脏病
<10-10,House>If you've got heart disease

158
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,610
<10-10,House>吃了这药你就死翘翘了
<10-10,House>from ignoring the diabetes, they'll kill you.

159
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:28,510
<10-10,House>注意点儿  你俩这周末就爽了
<10-10,House>Otherwise, you two have a fun weekend.

160
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:39,700
<11-1,Chase>血氧浓度在下降
<11-1,Chase>O2 SATS are dropping.

161
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:41,080
<11-2,Cameron>-呼吸音如何  -粗糙
<11-2,Cameron>- Breath sounds? - Junky.

162
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:42,720
<11-4,Cameron>-粘液阻塞吗  -不  是我们的错
<11-4,Cameron>- Mucus plug? - No, it's our mistake.

163
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,870
<11-5,Foreman>免疫球蛋白引起血栓  导致肺部无法供血
<11-5,Foreman>Sludging from the I.V.I.G. Blood can't get to his lungs.

164
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,460
<11-6,Cameron>准备500毫升肝素  静脉滴注
<11-6,Cameron>Start heparin-- 500 C.C.'s I.V.

165
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:49,080
<11-7,Chase>他撑不到肝素起作用
<11-7,Chase>He won't last long enough for it to work.

166
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:50,510
<11-7,Chase>必须立刻插喉管
<11-7,Chase>We've got to intubate him stat.

167
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,750
<11-8,Foreman>不行  他签过D.N.R.
<11-8,Foreman>We can't. He's D.N.R.

168
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:54,480
<11-9,Chase>什么
<11-9,Chase>What?

169
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:05,640
<12-1,Doctor in Elevator>-乐迷吧  -对
<12-1,Doctor in Elevator>- Someone likes music. - Oh, yeah.

170
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:14,110
<13-3,House>血氧浓度只有70
<13-3,House>His SATS are in the 70s.

171
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,470
<13-4,Foreman>-有多久了  -10分钟
<13-4,Foreman>- How long's he been like this? - Ten minutes.

172
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,910
<13-5,House>-干吗不...  -是免疫球蛋白导致呼吸衰竭
<13-5,House>- Why aren't you-- - The I.V.I.G. Put him in respiratory failure.

173
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:20,050
<13-6,Foreman>-你给他加了免疫球蛋白  -是我们
<13-6,Foreman>- You put him on I.V.I.G.? - We did this.

174
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:22,020
<13-7,House>那就取消  奇斯
<13-7,House>So undo it. Chase?

175
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:23,670
<13-8,Foreman>太晚了  是我们害死了他
<13-8,Foreman>It's too late. We killed him.

176
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,550
<13-9,House>没人害死他  他还没死呢
<13-9,House>Nobody killed him. He's not dead.

177
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:28,540
<13-9,House>-奇斯  插喉管  -他签了D.N.R.
<13-9,House>- Chase, intubate him. - He's D.N.R.

178
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:40,380
<13-12,House>你要干什么
<13-12,House>What are you doin'?

179
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:47,510
<13-13,Foreman>不能这么做
<13-13,Foreman>You can't do this!

180
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,400
<13-13,Foreman>-气囊  -你不能这么做
<13-13,Foreman>- Bag. - You can't do this.

181
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:53,310
<13-13,Foreman>气囊
<13-13,Foreman>Bag!

182
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,110
<13-14,House>他对某种用药有不良反应
<13-14,House>He had a bad reaction to some medicine we gave him.

183
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:06,670
<13-15,Cora>你刚刚做了什么
<13-15,Cora>What did you just do?

184
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:09,810
<13-16,Cameron>他救了他一命
<13-16,Cameron>He saved his life.

185
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,480
<14-1,Chase>使用呼吸机后情况稳定  吸氧充分
<14-1,Chase>He's stable on the ventilator, oxygenating well.

186
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,430
<14-2,House>免疫球蛋白致他病情恶化
<14-2,House>The I.V.I.G. made him worse,

187
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,010
<14-2,House>说明他的病不是多灶性运动神经症
<14-2,House>which means multifocal motor neuropathy was a bad diagnosis.

188
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:35,620
<14-2,House>好了  他到底是什么病
<14-2,House>Okay, what's really wrong with him?

189
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,090
<14-3,Foreman>你有毛病是吧
<14-3,Foreman>What's wrong with you?

190
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:38,340
<14-4,House>我有什么病地球人都知道
<14-4,House>Everyone knows what's wrong with me.

191
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:39,930
<14-4,House>知道他有什么病  才更有意思
<14-4,House>What's wrong with him is more interesting.

192
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,030
<14-5,Foreman>你给放弃抢救的病人插喉管
<14-5,Foreman>You tubed him, and he didn't want to be tubed.

193
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,350
<14-5,Foreman>他可是签过法律文件的
<14-5,Foreman>He has a legal paper saying just that.

194
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,810
<14-6,House>插喉管还是不插喉管
<14-6,House>To intubate or not to intubate

195
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:47,250
<14-6,House>那是个道德问题
<14-6,House>That is the big ethical question.

196
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:48,610
<14-6,House>事实上  我不希望讨论这个
<14-6,House>Actually, I was hoping we could avoid it

197
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:50,140
<14-6,House>还是直接考虑后续用药问题
<14-6,House>and maybe just practice some medicine.

198
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:53,340
<14-7,Foreman>根本就没有问题  病人已经决定了
<14-7,Foreman>There is no question. It's the patient's decision.

199
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:55,320
<14-8,House>那也得病人有能力决定
<14-8,House>If the patient is competent to make it.

200
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,740
<14-8,House>而不是因甲状腺水平造成情绪抑郁
<14-8,House>If his thyroid numbers aren't making him sad.

201
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,190
<14-9,Foreman>天哪  你说这话谁信啊
<14-9,Foreman>Oh, my God. You don't believe that.

202
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,720
<14-10,Cameron>他的甲状腺水平确实有点儿低
<14-10,Cameron>His thyroid levels were a little...

203
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:02,990
<14-11,Foreman>这不代表什么  别帮他讲话
<14-11,Foreman>It's nothing. Do not defend him!

204
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:05,950
<14-12,House>-他为何要签D.N.R.  -我可没有让他...
<14-12,House>- Why did he sign that D.N.R.? - I-I didn't talk him into--

205
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:07,390
<14-14,House>不  他签D.N.R.协议
<14-14,House>No. He signed the D.N.R.

206
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:10,050
<14-14,House>是因为不想因A.L.S.缓慢痛苦地死去
<14-14,House>'cause he didn't want a slow, painful death from A.L.S.

207
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,950
<14-14,House>可他刚才那种情况  跟A.L.S.完全无关
<14-14,House>What was happening had nothing to do with his A.L.S.

208
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:13,920
<14-15,Foreman>完全正确  那是免疫球蛋白造成的
<14-15,Foreman>Exactly! It's the I.V.I.G.

209
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,020
<14-15,Foreman>是你用错药了
<14-15,Foreman>You screwed up!

210
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:17,470
<14-15,Foreman>你不想让他死  是因为你用错药了
<14-15,Foreman>You're not gonna let him die because you screwed up.

211
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:21,730
<14-16,House>严格说来  你的病人  是你搞砸了
<14-16,House>Technically, your case. You screwed up.

212
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,420
<14-16,House>你这样算什么
<14-16,House>Is that what this is about

213
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,330
<14-16,House>让你前老大没面子吗
<14-16,House>looking bad in front of your old boss?

214
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,020
<14-17,Foreman>-你给他造成了伤害  -好吧  我保证不再犯
<14-17,Foreman>- You assaulted that man. - Fine. I'll never do it again.

215
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,790
<14-20,House>-谁信啊  -所以说这场争论完全没意义嘛
<14-20,House>- Yes, you will. - All the more reason this debate is pointless.

216
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,480
<14-21,House>肺部情况恶化  有何可能
<14-21,House>His lungs are worse. Any theories?

217
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,240
<14-21,House>我确信他没事的
<14-21,House>Oh, I'm sure he just went

218
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,110
<14-21,House>小男孩躲自己房间去而已  来想病因吧
<14-21,House>to the little boys' room. Come on, people.

219
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:47,600
<14-23,House>-结节性脉管炎  -不会两个肺都感染
<14-23,House>- Um, vasculitis? - Wouldn't likely hit both lungs.

220
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:49,490
<14-24,Cameron>有可能是韦格纳肉芽肿
<14-24,Cameron>It could be Wegener's granulomatosis.

221
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:51,160
<14-25,Woman>豪斯医生
<14-25,Woman>Dr. House?

222
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:56,210
<14-26,House>卡迪又给我找了个脱衣舞女
<14-26,House>Cuddy sent me a stripper again?

223
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:58,750
<14-26,House>爱死她了  这么周到
<14-26,House>Love that woman. So thoughtful.

224
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:00,370
<14-27,Woman>抱歉让你失望了
<14-27,Woman>Sorry.

225
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:02,790
<14-28,Chase>有过类似病例
<14-28,Chase>There are case reports of

226
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,950
<14-28,Chase>韦格纳肉芽肿同时感染双肺和脊柱
<14-28,Chase>Wegener's hitting both the lungs and the spine.

227
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:06,920
<14-29,House>那病也很凶险  但总比A.L.S.好
<14-29,House>Well, it's not great, but it's better than A.L.S.

228
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,110
<14-29,House>至少尚可治疗
<14-29,House>At least it's treatable.

229
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,140
<14-30,Cameron>这是法院的禁制令
<14-30,Cameron>It's a restraining order.

230
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:11,760
<14-30,Cameron>禁止你出现在约翰·亨利·贾尔斯50英尺以内
<14-30,Cameron>You're not to come within 50 feet of John Henry Giles,

231
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,940
<14-30,Cameron>已上诉地方法院  控告你伤害罪
<14-30,Cameron>and they've asked the D.A. to file criminal charges for battery.

233
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,820
<14-31,House>卡梅隆  检测血清  是否胞浆型阳性
<14-31,House>Cameron, test the blood for C-ANCA.

234
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:22,330
<14-32,Cameron>这可是刑事指控
<14-32,Cameron>These are criminal charges.

235
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:24,410
<14-32,Cameron>不会允许你继续抽血化验的
<14-32,Cameron>They're not gonna let you take blood to make more tests.

236
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,070
<14-33,House>实验室还有他血样  加一项包浆抗体检测就是
<14-33,House>He has blood left in the lab. Just add on the C-ANCA.

237
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,050
<14-33,House>福曼还要求你们做
<14-33,House>Foreman still got you doing bronchoscopic

239
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,390
<14-35,House>好  窥镜探入肺部时
<14-35,House>Well, while you're down in his lungs,

240
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:34,960
<14-35,House>取点活组织做切片  得证实是否韦氏病
<14-35,House>grab a biopsy. We'll need it to confirm Wegener's.

00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:38,250
<14-35,House>-还有  把他搬到二楼的重症监护室  -为什么
<14-35,House>- And move the patient to the second floor I.C.U. - Why?

242
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,490
<14-37,House>就在门诊部楼上
<14-37,House>It's right above the clinic.

243
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,000
<14-37,House>不管怎么算  都在50英尺以内
<14-37,House>I'm pretty sure it's 50 feet in any direction.

244
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:44,220
<14-37,House>能有法院禁令
<14-37,House>It's nice having a court order

245
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:46,050
<14-37,House>让我免了在门诊值班  挺好的
<14-37,House>saying you don't have to work clinic duty.

246
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:05,770
<15-2,Cuddy>-卡迪医生  -失陪一下
<15-2,Cuddy>- Dr. Cuddy!  - Excuse me.

247
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,600
<15-4,Cuddy>-你呼我  -你喊什么喊
<15-4,Cuddy>- You paged me. - Why the yelling?

248
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:13,510
<15-5,House>他的床位就在墙后面  原告
<15-5,House>His bed is behind that wall-- the plaintiff's.

249
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,240
<15-5,House>你知道的  我不能靠近他
<15-5,House>I can't, you know, come any closer.

250
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,490
<15-6,Cuddy>就在门诊部楼上  很聪明嘛
<15-6,Cuddy>It's right over the clinic. Very cute.

251
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:21,750
<15-7,House>说教能长话短说吗  我还得...
<15-7,House>Can we get the lecture over with 'cause I've gotta--

252
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,570
<15-7,House>事实上  我没事可做  你尽管说
<15-7,House>Actually, I've got nothing to do. Take your time.

253
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:27,840
<15-8,Cuddy>要帮你请律师吗
<15-8,Cuddy>You need a lawyer?

254
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,780
<15-9,House>你对我的所作所为  没意见吗
<15-9,House>You don't have a problem with what I did?

255
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:34,260
<15-10,Cuddy>我雇你的时候  就知道你是个疯子
<15-10,Cuddy>When I hired you, I knew you were insane.

256
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:37,670
<15-10,Cuddy>我将继续致力于阻止你疯狂行事
<15-10,Cuddy>I will continue to try and stop you from doing insane things.

257
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:38,570
<15-10,Cuddy>一旦事已酿成
<15-10,Cuddy>But once they're done,

258
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:41,340
<15-10,Cuddy>还执迷不悟的阻止你
<15-10,Cuddy>trying to convince an insane person

259
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:44,990
<15-10,Cuddy>那就是我有问题了
<15-10,Cuddy>not to do insane things is in itself insane.

260
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:47,830
<15-10,Cuddy>雇你的时候  就已经做了每年五万的预算
<15-10,Cuddy>So when I hired you, I also set aside $50,000

261
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,130
<15-10,Cuddy>为你找律师
<15-10,Cuddy>a year for legal expenses.

262
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,620
<15-10,Cuddy>目前为止  还能糊弄过来
<15-10,Cuddy>So far you've come in under budget.

263
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:56,910
<15-11,House>太好了  那还能帮我做些化验吗
<15-11,House>Great. Any chance you could help me run some tests?

264
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,950
<15-12,Cuddy>福曼医生打电话给汉密尔顿了
<15-12,Cuddy>Dr. Foreman called Dr. Hamilton.

265
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,780
<15-12,Cuddy>他正从洛杉矶飞来
<15-12,Cuddy>He's flying in from L.A.

266
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:03,430
<15-13,House>你可以跟他谈谈
<15-13,House>You can talk to him.

267
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:07,750
<15-14,Cuddy>汉密尔顿医生此次是以约翰·亨利朋友身份前来
<15-14,Cuddy>Dr. Hamilton is flying in as a friend of John Henry's...

268
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:09,970
<15-14,Cuddy>帮他放弃治疗的
<15-14,Cuddy>to pull the plug.

269
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:17,340
<15-15,House>对  我要个律师
<15-15,House>Yeah. I need a lawyer.

270
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:24,900
<15-15,House>法官大人  作为格利高里·豪斯的代理律师
<15-15,House>Your Honor, on behalf of Gregory House,

271
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:27,310
<15-15,House>要求法院紧急开庭是为提交诉讼请求
<15-15,House>we have convened an emergency session of this court...

272
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,700
<15-15,House>请求法院裁定
<15-15,House>to bring a motion requesting

273
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:31,640
<15-15,House>约翰·亨利·贾尔斯继续接受治疗
<15-15,House>that John Henry Giles remain on life support.

274
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:35,670
<16-1,Judge Winter>豪斯医生被指控故意伤害
<16-1,Judge Winter>Mr. House faces criminal charges for battery against...

275
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,430
<16-1,Judge Winter>约翰·亨利·贾尔斯
<16-1,Judge Winter>John Henry Giles.

276
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,240
<16-1,Judge Winter>你居然袭击个坐轮椅的人
<16-1,Judge Winter>You beat up a guy in a wheelchair?

277
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:44,990
<16-1,Judge Winter>豪斯医生被指控  违背贾尔斯先生意愿
<16-1,Judge Winter>Dr. House is alleged to have forced a tube down

278
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:46,800
<16-2,House>帮贾尔斯先生插喉管
<16-2,House>Mr.Giles's throat against his will.

279
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:50,430
<16-2,House>那是医疗用管  救人用的
<16-2,House>A medical tube, saving his life.

280
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:53,580
<16-3,Judge Winter>豪斯医生  请让你的律师代表你发言
<16-3,Judge Winter>Dr. House, please let your attorney speak for you.

281
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,250
<16-4,House>抱歉  法官大人  是我出格了
<16-4,House>I'm sorry, Your Honor. I was way out of line.

282
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:04,980
<16-5,Judge Winter>也就是说  你的委托人强制给病人插喉管
<16-5,Judge Winter>So, uh, your client forced the patient into this position,

283
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,840
<16-5,Judge Winter>现在还想请求法院裁定
<16-5,Judge Winter>and now he wants a court order

284
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:10,210
<16-5,Judge Winter>继续强制病人接受治疗
<16-5,Judge Winter>to force the patient to stay that way.

285
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,370
<16-5,Judge Winter>没有那根管子
<16-5,Judge Winter>Without the tube,

286
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:13,860
<16-6,Judge Winter>贾尔斯先生很有可能就一命呜呼了
<16-6,Judge Winter>there's a high likelihood that Mr. Giles will die.

287
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:17,080
<16-6,Judge Winter>病人应该很清楚这点  他签了D.N.R.协议
<16-6,Judge Winter>Well, I assume the patient knows that. He had a D.N.R.

288
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:20,250
<16-6,Judge Winter>也正因此  你的委托人才被控犯罪  不是吗
<16-6,Judge Winter>That's why your client is facing criminal charges, right?

289
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:23,000
<16-6,Judge Winter>是的  但贾尔斯先生的死
<16-6,Judge Winter>Exactly. And Mr. Giles's death

290
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:25,950
<16-7,Judge Winter>也将触犯我委托人与其当庭对峙的权利
<16-7,Judge Winter>will violate my client's Sixth Amendment right.

291
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:30,900
<16-7,Judge Winter>你指他与原告对质的权利  很聪明
<16-7,Judge Winter>His right to face his accuser. That's clever, huh?

292
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:35,030
<16-20,House>法官大人  根据联邦宾州豪斯顿的案例
<16-20,House>Your Honor, in Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. Hoselton,

293
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:36,640
<16-16,Judge Winter>施用于第三区时规定
<16-16,Judge Winter>the Third District ruled that

294
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,320
<16-12,Wilson>被告无权利用职务之便  违反...
<16-12,Wilson>a defendant may not use that status to rule against--

295
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:41,510
<16-8,Wilson>你为什么这么做
<16-8,Wilson>Why are you doing this?

296
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:43,500
<16-8,Wilson>-又不能免你牢狱之灾  -是不能
<16-8,Wilson>- It's not gonna keep you out of jail. - No.

297
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,700
<16-10,Wilson>即使你打赢官司  那份限制令
<16-10,Wilson>Even if you win, the restraining order

298
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:49,080
<16-10,Wilson>和伤害指控也不会撤销  有什么好处
<16-10,Wilson>and battery charge stay in place, so what have you gained?

299
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:49,930
<16-11,House>时间
<16-11,House>Time.

300
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,780
<16-12,Wilson>争取时间确诊吗  你都不能靠近他
<16-12,Wilson>To diagnose him? You can't get near him.

301
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,100
<16-13,House>我也不想
<16-13,House>I don't want to be near him.

302
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,610
<16-14,Wilson>有些医生有救世主情结
<16-14,Wilson>Well, some doctors have the messiah complex.

303
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:59,110
<16-14,Wilson>总想着拯救世界
<16-14,Wilson>They need to save the world.

304
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:02,670
<16-14,Wilson>你有魔方情结  总想着解决疑难杂症
<16-14,Wilson>You've got the Rubik's complex. You need to solve the puzzle.

305
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:06,450
<16-15,House>你有完没完  还想对80年代时尚发表什么高论
<16-15,House>Are you done? Or do you have more references to 1980s' fads?

306
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,880
<16-15,House>我还想认真听庭审呢
<16-15,House>I'm trying to listen to this.

307
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,490
<16-15,House>那份D.N.R.协议有效性值得质疑
<16-15,House>That D.N.R. May not be valid.

308
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:12,820
<16-16,Judge Winter>病人当时正因甲状腺功能失调
<16-16,Judge Winter>The patient was suffering from

309
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:15,430
<16-16,Judge Winter>情绪极度沮丧抑郁
<16-16,Judge Winter>depression brought on by a thyroid imbalance.

310
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,780
<16-16,Judge Winter>该D.N.R.协议签署时
<16-16,Judge Winter>The D.N.R. Order was witnessed...

311
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:21,960
<16-16,Judge Winter>有豪斯医生的手下  福曼医生作证
<16-16,Judge Winter>by Dr. House's own staff, a-- a-- a Dr. Foreman.

312
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,590
<16-17,House>我那群手下都是白痴
<16-17,House>My staff are idiots.

313
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:25,470
<16-17,House>相信你肯定感同身受  法官大人
<16-17,House>I'm sure you know what it's like, Your Honor.

314
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:26,810
<16-18,Judge Winter>坐下
<16-18,Judge Winter>Sit down.

315
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:34,690
<16-18,Judge Winter>D.N.R.协议的有效性  确实是个问题
<16-18,Judge Winter>The validity of the D.N.R. is a question of fact.

316
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,300
<16-18,Judge Winter>应该给豪斯医生一个机会
<16-18,Judge Winter>Dr. House should have the opportunity

317
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,370
<16-19,Judge Winter>收集足够证据  来证明自己的清白
<16-19,Judge Winter>to make his argument at a full trial.

318
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:40,550
<16-19,Judge Winter>而这位可怜的病人
<16-19,Judge Winter>And this poor guy has got to

319
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:43,360
<16-19,Judge Winter>在他收集足够证据前  只能继续接受治疗
<16-19,Judge Winter>stay on life support until we can schedule a trial.

320
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:45,210
<16-20,House>-法官大人  -豪斯医生
<16-20,House>- Your Honor-- - Dr. House,

321
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:49,740
<16-21,Judge Winter>再不坐下  我就告你蔑视法庭
<16-21,Judge Winter>I will hold you in contempt if you don't sit down.

322
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:50,980
<16-22,House>我有个医学问题
<16-22,House>I have a medical issue.

323
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,730
<16-23,Judge Winter>如果跟本案有关  你的律师...
<16-23,Judge Winter>If it pertains to this case, your attorney--

324
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,770
<16-23,Judge Winter>跟本案无关
<16-23,Judge Winter>It doesn't.

325
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,950
<16-24,House>您的家族有心脏病史吗
<16-24,House>Do you have any history of heart disease in your family?

326
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,440
<16-20,House>-法官大人  -您的手指
<16-20,House>- Your Honor! - Your fingers--

327
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:03,420
<16-25,House>您的手指呈杵状  表示可能有心脏问题
<16-25,House>They show signs of clubbing, which indicates a heart problem.

329
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:07,920
<16-25,House>还记得巴特·吉亚玛提  和您一样  突然有天就猝死了
<16-25,House>Remember Bart Giamatti? Same thing-- Just dropped dead one day.

330
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:11,700
<16-25,House>-请及时去看医生  -他已经承认这与本案无关
<16-25,House>- Please see your doctor. - He's admitted this isn't relevant.

331
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,900
<16-19,Judge Winter>能回到本案中来吗
<16-19,Judge Winter>Can we get back to the motion?

332
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:17,520
<16-13,House>-当然  抱歉  -法官大人
<16-13,House>- Of course. I-I'm sorry. - Your Honor,

333
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:22,790
<16-7,Judge Winter>病人决定自身治疗进程的权利
<16-7,Judge Winter>a person's right to control the treatment of their own body...

334
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:25,400
<16-7,Judge Winter>是理解本案的基础
<16-7,Judge Winter>is fundamental to understanding this case.

335
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:29,340
<16-7,Judge Winter>不论是联邦法院还是州立法院  大量的案例支持...
<16-7,Judge Winter>A long line of cases, both federal and state, stand to--

336
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:33,300
<17-1,Wilson>恭喜  法庭辩论让人印象深刻
<17-1,Wilson>Congratulations. Impressive legal argument.

337
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:35,780
<17-2,House>-我昨晚看马特洛克(律政剧集)了  -还别说
<17-2,House>- I watched Matlock last night. - Say no more.

338
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,950
<17-3,Wilson>我都没注意到法官的杵状指
<17-3,Wilson>I didn't notice any clubbing on the judge's fingers.

339
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,810
<17-4,House>我也没有
<17-4,House>Neither did I.

340
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:41,000
<17-5,Wilson>那你说的家族病史...
<17-5,Wilson>So the family history thing--

341
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:43,790
<17-6,House>每个家族都有心脏病史
<17-6,House>Every family has some history of heart disease.

342
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:45,400
<17-7,Wilson>还有精神病史
<17-7,Wilson>And mental illness.

343
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:54,390
<18-1,Chase>-活检只显示有炎症  -给他用环磷酰胺
<18-1,Chase>- Biopsy only shows inflammation. - Start him on Cytoxan.

344
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:56,870
<18-3,Cameron>就凭一点炎症  就确诊为韦氏病吗
<18-3,Cameron>You're diagnosing Wegener's based on a little inflammation?

345
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:58,370
<18-4,House>不幸的是  我只是认为
<18-4,House>Well, unfortunately, I think

346
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:00,020
<18-4,House>虽然他自己不想做任何检测
<18-4,House>we've exhausted all the tests we can do...

347
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,250
<18-4,House>但我们已经尽了医生的本份
<18-4,House>in our capacity as the doctors that

348
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,350
<18-4,House>-能做的检测  都做过了  -你没有...
<18-4,House>- he doesn't want doing tests on him. - Well, you don't--

349
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:05,390
<18-6,House>如果用药后他能走了  说明用对药了
<18-6,House>We'll know I'm right if he starts walking.

350
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,530
<18-7,Chase>什么检测都不能做  还让我们继续治疗吗
<18-7,Chase>We can't do any more tests, but you want me to treat him?

351
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:10,940
<18-8,House>药在药房  病人就在重症监护室
<18-8,House>Medicine's in the pharmacy. Patient's immobilized in the I.C.U.

352
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:12,820
<18-8,House>简单的地理学问题
<18-8,House>Sounds like a simple geography problem.

353
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:15,830
<18-9,Cameron>你是要我们冒着
<18-9,Cameron>Are you asking us to jeopardize

354
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:17,540
<18-9,Cameron>被吊销行医执照的危险给他治疗
<18-9,Cameron>our medical licenses for this treatment?

355
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:44,960
<18-9,Cameron>有什么能帮你的吗
<18-9,Cameron>Can I help you?

356
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:48,350
<19-1,House>我是豪斯医生  我...
<19-1,House>Uh, I'm Dr. House. I--

357
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,090
<19-2,Hamilton>格雷戈是吧  我是马丁·汉密尔顿  约翰的医生
<19-2,Hamilton>Greg, right? I'm Marty Hamilton, John Henry's doctor.

358
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:54,660
<19-2,Hamilton>我们谈谈
<19-2,Hamilton>We should talk.

359
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:01,640
<19-2,Hamilton>感谢你像刚才那样给他用药
<19-2,Hamilton>Appreciate any list of, uh, medications-- anything like that.

360
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,370
<19-2,Hamilton>开始给他静脉滴注环磷酰胺了
<19-2,Hamilton>I've started him on Cytoxan.

361
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:05,630
<20-1,Hamilton>治疗韦氏病的  对吧
<20-1,Hamilton>For Wegener's, right?

362
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:08,010
<20-2,House>听我说  格雷戈
<20-2,House>Look, Greg.

363
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,580
<20-3,Hamilton>我查过你的资料
<20-3,Hamilton>I checked you out, you know?

364
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:12,110
<20-3,Hamilton>知道你是位好医生
<20-3,Hamilton>I know you're a good doctor,

365
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,250
<20-3,Hamilton>但你得承认  我这位医生也不赖
<20-3,Hamilton>and you have to appreciate that I'm a good doctor too.

366
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:18,050
<20-5,Hamilton>-为什么  -韦氏病的可能我早就考虑过了
<20-5,Hamilton>- Why? - Wegener's is one of the first things I looked for.

367
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,940
<20-5,Hamilton>活检和血检都是阴性的  相信你也一样
<20-5,Hamilton>The biopsy and the blood test were negative, just like yours.

368
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:22,900
<20-6,House>总会有错的  马丁
<20-6,House>There's an error rate, Marty.

369
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:24,700
<20-7,Hamilton>总要有释然的那一天
<20-7,Hamilton>And there's a time to let go.

370
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,660
<20-7,Hamilton>我会拔掉约翰·亨利的呼吸机
<20-7,Hamilton>Look, I'm gonna take him off the ventilator,

371
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:30,430
<20-7,Hamilton>他会逝去  正是他所希望的
<20-7,Hamilton>and John Henry's going to die. He's accepted that.

372
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:32,260
<20-7,Hamilton>汉密尔顿医生
<20-7,Hamilton>Dr. Hamilton.

373
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,990
<20-8,Foreman>-你好  -你好
<20-8,Foreman>- How you doin'? - Hey, how you doin'?

374
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:40,520
<20-8,Foreman>抱歉  不该给你病人用免疫球蛋白的
<20-8,Foreman>Dr. Hamilton.I'm sorry.I should have never put your patient on I.V.I.G.

375
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,460
<20-9,Hamilton>不是你的错  艾瑞克
<20-9,Hamilton>It's not your fault, Eric.

376
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:45,250
<20-10,House>-是我的错  艾瑞克  -我可没这么说
<20-10,House>- No, it's mine, Eric. - That's not what I said.

377
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:47,410
<20-11,Hamilton>洛杉矶那边大家都问你好
<20-11,Hamilton>Everybody asks about you out in L.A.

378
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,500
<20-12,Foreman>那边现在怎么样
<20-12,Foreman>How's the old place doin'?

379
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:50,820
<20-12,Foreman>真是感人啊
<20-12,Foreman>Oh, this is wonderful.

380
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,970
<20-13,House>两位先别真情流露  容我先说一句
<20-13,House>But before you guys break out the oil, I should point out

381
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:55,500
<20-13,House>你不能给他拔掉呼吸机  我有法庭禁令
<20-13,House>that you can't pull the plug. I have a court order.

382
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:58,940
<20-14,Hamilton>之前可能是  但...
<20-14,Hamilton>You used to, but--

383
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,500
<20-15,House>我有权跟原告当面对质  法官说的
<20-15,House>I have the right to face my accuser. Judge said so.

384
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:04,850
<20-16,Hamilton>除非没有原告  所有控告都已撤销
<20-16,Hamilton>Not if no one's accusing you. All the charges have been dropped.

385
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:13,740
<20-17,House>他根本不必死
<20-17,House>He doesn't have to die.

386
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:19,130
<20-18,Foreman>不是韦氏病
<20-18,Foreman>It's not Wegener's.

387
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:37,030
<20-19,House>如果是韦氏病  他的双肺根本撑不下去
<20-19,House>If it's Wegener's, his lungs won't be able to handle it.

388
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:39,840
<20-19,House>一旦拔下呼吸机  他就会死
<20-19,House>Soon as they pull that plug, he'll die.

389
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:43,060
<20-20,Wilson>所以才说  拔掉呼吸机就像拔掉电源
<20-20,Wilson>That's why they call it "Pulling the plug".

390
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:05,590
<20-21,Cora>我会想你的
<20-21,Cora>I'm gonna miss you.

391
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:46,350
<20-23,Hamilton>-他仍在呼吸  -血氧浓度稳定
<20-23,Hamilton>- He's still breathing. - His O2 sats are holding.

392
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,560
<20-24,Foreman>-血氧浓度靠自身稳定下来了  -他还在呼吸
<20-24,Foreman>- He's holding his own. - He's still breathing.

393
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,650
<20-25,Wilson>那不是韦氏病
<20-25,Wilson>It's not Wegener's.

394
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:06,870
<20-26,House>又错了
<20-26,House>Wrong again.

395
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:15,620
<21-1,Wilson>他情况稳定  单侧手臂失去知觉
<21-1,Wilson>He's stable, but one of his arms is now paralyzed.

396
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,810
<21-2,House>真正的问题是  他为什么还活着
<21-2,House>The real question is, why is he still alive?

397
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,350
<21-3,Wilson>会是因为他斗志顽强吗
<21-3,Wilson>Do you think he's just being stubborn?

398
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,720
<21-4,Foreman>因为你又错了  不是韦氏病
<21-4,Foreman>He's alive because you were wrong. It's not Wegener's.

399
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,180
<21-5,House>对  最近好像总是这样
<21-5,House>Yeah. Seem to be doing that a lot lately.

400
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,200
<21-5,House>总是有人靠我犯错得以续命
<21-5,House>People keep living because of my mistakes.

401
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:29,170
<21-5,House>瘫痪病情的恶化
<21-5,House>Progression of the paralysis

402
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:31,580
<21-6,Cameron>证明汉密尔顿基本上是对的  就是A.L.S.
<21-6,Cameron>pretty much confirmed Hamilton was right. It's A.L.S.

403
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:33,620
<21-7,House>那得假定瘫痪的病情确实在恶化
<21-7,House>Assuming this is a progression of his paralysis.

404
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:34,950
<21-8,Chase>单侧手臂不能活动
<21-8,Chase>He can't move his arm.

405
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:38,450
<21-9,House>对  他手臂瘫痪了  对  他双腿也瘫痪了
<21-9,House>Yes, his arm is paralyzed. Yes, his legs are paralyzed.

406
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:41,150
<21-9,House>为什么大家都不约而同认为两者有联系
<21-9,House>Why is everyone so gung ho to connect those two conditions?

407
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:44,440
<21-9,House>你可以认为我错了  但没理由停止思考真正病因
<21-9,House>You can think I'm wrong, but that's no reason to stop thinking.

408
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:47,220
<21-10,Foreman>这么想怎样  他不是我们的病人
<21-10,Foreman>How about this one? He's not our patient.

409
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,840
<21-11,House>不  这理由不够好
<21-11,House>Nope. Not good enough.

410
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,390
<21-12,Cameron>插喉管那次  他可能是因为血栓而致呼吸衰竭
<21-12,Cameron>He could've suffered a stroke when he was intubated.

411
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:53,900
<21-12,Cameron>血凝块  在瘫痪病人身上很常见
<21-12,Cameron>Well, blood clots are common in paralyzed patients.

412
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,150
<21-13,House>-血流堵塞导致...  -原因我不感兴趣
<21-13,House>- The inactivity causes-- - Not interested in why.

413
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:59,100
<21-13,House>做个血管造影  找找有无栓塞
<21-13,House>Let's get an M.R. Angiogram, check for an embolic stroke.

414
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:00,370
<21-14,Foreman>他不想由你治疗
<21-14,Foreman>He doesn't want you treating him.

415
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,830
<21-15,House>-他们撤销了上诉  -对
<21-15,House>- They dropped the court order. - Yeah,

417
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:03,650
<21-16,Wilson>那女孩也撤销了对科比的上诉
<21-16,Wilson>and that girl dropped the charges against Kobe.

418
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,830
<21-16,Wilson>并不意味着他就能打给她
<21-16,Wilson>Doesn't mean he should call her

419
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:06,650
<21-16,Wilson>-随时邀她去吃圣代  -说得好
<21-16,Wilson>- and see if she's free to get a sundae. - Good point.

420
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,660
<21-17,House>但我现在能靠近他了
<21-17,House>But I can go within 50 feet of him now.

421
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,030
<22-1,Hamilton>需要的时候就找人呼我  随时都行
<22-1,Hamilton>You need me, you have 'em page me. Anytime.

422
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:18,840
<22-2,John>好
<22-2,John>Okay.

423
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:40,130
<22-3,House>-出去  -好  这样赶我也有道理
<22-3,House>- Get out of here. - Sure. That makes sense.

424
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:41,990
<22-3,House>你恨我救了你一命
<22-3,House>You hate me for saving your life.

425
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,370
<22-3,House>站在你的立场上看
<22-3,House>Well, in fairness to your side,

426
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:46,140
<22-3,House>你也是因为我差点死掉  所以...
<22-3,House>you were also dying because of me, so--

427
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,600
<22-4,John>你知道我不想被抢救
<22-4,John>You knew I didn't want to be saved.

428
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,710
<22-4,John>这正是有趣的地方
<22-4,John>That's what's interesting.

429
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:52,550
<22-5,House>你的甲状腺水平很低  但还不至于低到引起抑郁
<22-5,House>Your thyroid was low, but not enough to cause depression.

430
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:54,380
<22-6,John>所以你是来告诉我
<22-6,John>So you came here to tell me that

431
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:57,220
<22-6,John>即使我瘫痪了  还是可以听到鸟鸣
<22-6,John>even if I can't walk, I can still hear the birds sing,

432
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:01,160
<22-6,John>看到彩虹  感受到阳光拂过我脸庞
<22-6,John>enjoy a rainbow, the feeling of sunshine on my face?

433
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,250
<22-7,House>那些都很不错
<22-7,House>Those things are fun.

434
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:06,800
<22-7,House>我承认  活着就是受罪
<22-7,House>Okay. Life sucks.

435
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,710
<22-7,House>相比较而言  你更受罪
<22-7,House>Your life sucks more than most.

436
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:14,240
<22-7,House>虽然有更糟的  他们大多是自作孽不可活
<22-7,House>It's not as bad as some, which is depressing all by itself.

437
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:16,600
<22-7,House>帮我个忙
<22-7,House>But do me a favor.

438
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:19,820
<22-7,House>让我查出你到底是什么病
<22-7,House>Just let me find out what's wrong with you.

439
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:24,250
<22-7,House>到那时  你要是还想一死了之
<22-7,House>Then if you still want to kill yourself,

440
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,900
<22-7,House>我会助你一臂
<22-7,House>I'll give you a hand.

441
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:31,130
<22-7,House>-公平吗  -公平  当然
<22-7,House>- That sound fair? - Yeah. Sure.

442
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,500
<22-8,John>活受罪  只为了满足你的偏执
<22-8,John>I'll stick around to indulge your obsession.

443
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:38,340
<22-8,John>我已经完了  肺部没法运气
<22-8,John>It's over. I lost my air.

444
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:41,180
<22-8,John>那晚我去那间录音室...
<22-8,John>The session the other night with those kids--

445
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:45,200
<22-8,John>想试试看我还能否演奏  我做不到了
<22-8,John>That was a test to see if I could still play. I can't.

446
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:48,400
<22-9,House>你活着就为这个吗  做音乐
<22-9,House>And that's all you are, a musician?

447
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:51,870
<22-10,John>我只有这个  跟你一样
<22-10,John>I got one thing, same as you.

448
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:53,310
<22-10,John>真的
<22-10,John>Really?

449
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:57,340
<22-11,House>显然  你对我了解的比我对你的多
<22-11,House>Well, apparently you know me better than I know you.

450
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:59,000
<22-11,House>我知道你那条跛腿
<22-11,House>I know that limp.

451
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:01,640
<22-12,John>知道你为什么至今未婚
<22-12,John>I know the empty ring finger.

452
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:05,100
<22-12,John>知道你那近乎偏执的天性  那是你的隐秘
<22-12,John>And that obsessive nature of yours-- That's a big secret.

453
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,910
<22-12,John>你不惜冒着入狱失业的风险
<22-12,John>You don't risk jail and your career

454
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:11,000
<22-9,House>救一个一心求死之人
<22-9,House>to save somebody who doesn't want to be saved...

455
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:14,630
<22-10,John>除非你有一种信念  一种固执的信念
<22-10,John>unless you got something-- anything-- one thing.

456
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,030
<22-12,John>按部就班的人可以
<22-12,John>The reason normal people

457
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:20,700
<22-12,John>结婚生子  爱好广泛  等等等等
<22-12,John>got wives and kids and hobbies-- whatever--

458
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:23,850
<22-10,John>是因为他们缺少那种信念
<22-10,John>That's because they ain't got that one thing that--

459
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,810
<22-12,John>那种伤害至深又真挚隽永的执念
<22-12,John>that hits 'em that hard and that true.

460
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:28,990
<22-10,John>我有音乐  而你有这个
<22-10,John>I got music. You got this--

461
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,250
<22-12,John>一刻不停地占据你脑海
<22-12,John>the thing you think about all the time,

462
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,220
<22-12,John>让你不断地追寻着谜底
<22-12,John>thing that keeps you south of normal.

463
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,890
<22-12,John>正是这样  让我们更强  成为业内顶尖
<22-12,John>Yeah. Makes us great. Makes us the best.

464
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,190
<22-12,John>除此之外  我们一无所得
<22-12,John>All we miss out on is everything else.

465
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:45,490
<22-12,John>回家一室凄凉  没有爱人的亲近和小酌的闲趣
<22-12,John>No woman waiting at home after work with the drink and the kiss.

466
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:47,130
<22-12,John>孑然一身  形影相吊
<22-12,John>That ain't gonna happen for us.

467
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:50,500
<22-13,House>所以上帝创造了微波炉
<22-13,House>That's why God made microwaves.

468
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,090
<22-15,House>是啊
<22-15,House>Yeah.

469
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,590
<22-14,John>一旦没有音乐
<22-14,John>But when it's over,

470
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:57,450
<22-14,John>一切都结束了
<22-14,John>It's over.

471
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:03,720
<22-15,House>是啊
<22-15,House>Yeah.

472
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:22,510
<22-16,John>你这是干什么
<22-16,John>What're you doin'?

473
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:26,070
<22-17,House>对我来说  还没结束
<22-17,House>It's not over for me.

474
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:29,760
<22-17,House>要么你再报警  要么你就得跟我走
<22-17,House>Either you're gonna call the cops again, or we're doing this.

475
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:31,010
<22-17,House>你想死
<22-17,House>You want to die,

476
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:33,530
<22-17,House>躺在血管造影机里  也一样是死
<22-17,House>you can do it just as easily inside an M.R.I. Machine.

477
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,370
<23-1,Hamilton>等我回到洛杉矶
<23-1,Hamilton>So when I go back to L.A.,

478
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,330
<23-1,Hamilton>我还要做今年的权威讲座的报告
<23-1,Hamilton>I'm doing the Dana lectures again this year.

479
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,660
<23-2,Foreman>-那可是种殊荣  -政治嘛
<23-2,Foreman>- That's quite an honor. - It's all political.

480
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:52,730
<23-4,Foreman>别谦虚了  你应得的
<23-4,Foreman>Don't be modest. You've earned it.

481
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:54,710
<23-5,Hamilton>我的几项研究都取得很好成果
<23-5,Hamilton>I got lucky on a couple studies I was doing.

482
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:56,510
<23-5,Hamilton>总得有资格才行
<23-5,Hamilton>It all sells tickets.

483
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:58,480
<23-5,Hamilton>还记得去年的讲座吗
<23-5,Hamilton>You remember last year's lectures, don't you?

484
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,620
<23-6,Foreman>我记得后来的雪茄吧
<23-6,Foreman>I remember the cigar bar afterwards.

485
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,730
<23-7,Hamilton>参加这种会唯一的理由  雪茄和泳池美女
<23-7,Hamilton>The only reason to attend the thing-- cigars and pool.

486
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,860
<23-7,Hamilton>与豪斯医生共事愉快吗
<23-7,Hamilton>You enjoy working with Dr. House?

487
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:11,850
<23-8,Foreman>说出来就大不敬了
<23-8,Foreman>Not the word I'd use.

488
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:14,690
<23-9,Hamilton>我们都太专注工作  没时间享受人生  是吧
<23-9,Hamilton>We work too hard not to enjoy ourselves, right?

489
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:19,630
<23-10,Foreman>-有交往对象吗  -可以这么说吧
<23-10,Foreman>- Mmm. You seeing anybody? - Kinda, sorta.

490
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:23,370
<23-12,Foreman>-是认真的吗  -我不知道  可能吧
<23-12,Foreman>- Serious? - I don't know. It could be.

491
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,210
<23-13,Hamilton>你觉得她会喜欢洛杉矶吗
<23-13,Hamilton>You think she'd, uh, enjoy L.A.?

492
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,350
<24-1,Foreman>汉密尔顿邀我过去工作
<24-1,Foreman>Hamilton offered me a job.

493
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,180
<24-2,Cameron>-你准备接受  -还没决定
<24-2,Cameron>- You gonna take it? - I haven't decided.

494
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,020
<24-4,Cameron>你已经有最精英的同事了
<24-4,Cameron>You already have the most prestigious fellowship.

495
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,070
<24-5,Foreman>当他合伙人
<24-5,Foreman>It's a partnership--

496
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,040
<24-5,Foreman>三倍工资  汽车津贴
<24-5,Foreman>Three times the money, car allowance,

497
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,740
<24-5,Foreman>还有差旅费  完整的退休计划
<24-5,Foreman>moving expense, pension plan,

498
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:57,400
<24-5,Foreman>加上跟那样一个懂得尊重
<24-5,Foreman>the chance to work for a guy who gives a

499
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,660
<24-6,Chase>-别人想法的人共事  -那你为何不直接答应
<24-6,Chase>- crap what people think. - Why didn't you just tell him yes?

500
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:04,050
<24-7,Foreman>-我还有合同在这  -对
<24-7,Foreman>- I made a commitment here. - Right.

501
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:05,900
<24-9,Cameron>豪斯会立马答应让你走的
<24-9,Cameron>House would let you out of it in a heartbeat.

502
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,940
<24-10,Foreman>或者不会  而是拿我开涮
<24-10,Foreman>Or he wouldn't, just to jerk me around.

503
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,990
<24-10,Foreman>要是你们  会接受吗
<24-10,Foreman>Would you guys have taken the job?

504
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:11,160
<24-11,Chase>我不缺钱
<24-11,Chase>Don't need the money.

505
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,330
<24-12,Cameron>我们跟你不同  我并不讨厌豪斯
<24-12,Cameron>We're not like you. I don't hate House.

506
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:16,620
<24-13,Foreman>你们真对他的所作所为  完全没意见
<24-13,Foreman>You guys really don't have a problem with him, with what he did?

507
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:19,080
<24-14,Chase>他知道我们不赞成他的选择
<24-14,Chase>He knows we disagree with his choice.

508
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:22,620
<24-15,Foreman>选择  奇斯  那可不是挑个水果  而是是非之分
<24-15,Foreman>Choice? Chase, it's not apples and oranges. It's right and wrong.

509
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:25,670
<24-15,Foreman>他一贯表现得毫不在乎  比如袭击了那人...
<24-15,Foreman>And he does it like he doesn't care. He assaults the guy...

510
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,560
<24-15,Foreman>却若无其事一般
<24-15,Foreman>and moves on to the next

511
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,790
<24-15,Foreman>继续做其他诊断
<24-15,Foreman>differential diagnosis like it's nothing.

512
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:30,520
<24-16,Cameron>你要他怎样  手足无措  折磨自己
<24-16,Cameron>What do you want from him? Hand-wringing? Torment?

513
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:32,600
<24-16,Cameron>-要他每晚都痛哭流涕吗  -对
<24-16,Cameron>- You want him to cry himself to sleep at night? - Yeah!

514
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,290
<24-17,Foreman>对  我只想知道他是把这当一回事的
<24-17,Foreman>Yeah, I want some clue that he knows it's a big deal.

515
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:37,710
<24-17,Foreman>能让他有所畏惧  郑重其事
<24-17,Foreman>That it scares him, that it matters.

516
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:39,830
<24-18,Chase>那是什么
<24-18,Chase>Whoa, whoa. What's that?

517
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,270
<24-19,Cameron>真的是血栓
<24-19,Cameron>It was a stroke.

518
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,920
<24-20,Chase>-卡梅隆  干得好  -豪斯没错
<24-20,Chase>- Well done, Cameron. - House called it.

519
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:48,660
<24-21,Cameron>手脚的瘫痪  是不相关的
<24-21,Cameron>The arm and legs are unrelated.

520
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:52,050
<24-22,Foreman>一竿子下去  总能打到几个枣
<24-22,Foreman>Oh, you make enough calls, one of them is bound to be right.

521
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,110
<24-23,Chase>对  只是万分侥幸而已
<24-23,Chase>Yeah. He's just a lucky, lucky guy.

522
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:56,970
<24-24,Foreman>我只是觉得
<24-24,Foreman>Listen, listen. I just think

523
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,340
<24-24,Foreman>学着谦虚点  对他没坏处
<24-24,Foreman>it wouldn't hurt him to learn a little humility.

524
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:01,880
<24-25,House>诊断结果怎样
<24-25,House>So what's the verdict?

525
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:06,260
<24-26,Cameron>是血栓  手臂瘫痪是因为血凝块
<24-26,Cameron>Embolus. The arm problem was caused by a clot.

526
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:08,990
<24-27,Chase>施以组织纤溶酶原激活物  治血栓希望很大
<24-27,Chase>There's a good chance we can bust the clot with T.P.A.

527
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,020
<24-28,House>做吧  看他的手臂会怎样
<24-28,House>Do it. See what happens to his arm.

528
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:24,330
<25-1,Foreman>在你脑部发现血栓
<25-1,Foreman>We found a blood clot in your brain.

529
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,260
<25-1,Foreman>想开始给你用肝素  那是种血液稀释剂
<25-1,Foreman>We'd like to start you on heparin. It's a blood thinner.

530
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:29,780
<25-2,John>有何副作用
<25-2,John>What are the side effects?

531
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:32,790
<25-3,Foreman>你的肺因瘫痪影响  已经受损严重
<25-3,Foreman>your lungs are kind of chewed up from the pneumonia.

532
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:35,620
<25-3,Foreman>-很有可能破损出血  -会流血
<25-3,Foreman>- Good chance there'll be an effusion. - Bleeding?

533
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,190
<25-5,Hamilton>-流进肺里  -这是我们
<25-5,Hamilton>- Into his lungs. - It's our best

534
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,010
<25-6,Foreman>治愈你手臂瘫痪的最好机会
<25-6,Foreman>chance to give you back the use of your arm.

535
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:42,160
<25-7,John>以后都不能用肺运气  我还要手臂干嘛
<25-7,John>I don't need my arm without my air.

536
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:44,650
<25-8,Foreman>-这样伤害是最小的  -不
<25-8,Foreman>- The damage would likely be minimal. - No.

537
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:48,470
<25-10,Hamilton>他说了算
<25-10,Hamilton>It's his call.

538
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,160
<25-11,Foreman>或者可以施行栓子切除术
<25-11,Foreman>Or we could do an embolectomy.

539
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,910
<25-11,Foreman>基本上  就是利用手术取出血栓
<25-11,Foreman>Basically, we go in and pull the clot out.

540
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:59,570
<25-12,Cora>他拒绝用药  你们就建议他做开脑手术
<25-12,Cora>He's saying no to drugs, and you're recommending brain surgery?

541
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:02,020
<25-13,Hamilton>这样能避免肺部受损
<25-13,Hamilton>Bypasses the risk to the lungs.

542
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,210
<25-14,Foreman>-要么治愈你的手臂  要么...  -要么我一命呜呼
<25-14,Foreman>- It'll either help your arm, or-- - Or it'll kill me.

543
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,150
<25-15,John>站在你的立场  这是双赢的
<25-15,John>From your point of view, it's a win-win.

544
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:10,090
<25-17,John>好吧
<25-17,John>Okay.

545
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:12,560
<25-18,Foreman>我们今天就安排手术
<25-18,Foreman>We'll set up the procedure for today.

546
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,570
<26-1,Chase>现在进入你的颈动脉
<26-1,Chase>We're in your carotid artery.

547
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:29,980
<26-1,Chase>会沿着这里上行进入你大脑
<26-1,Chase>This is gonna take us all the way up into your brain.

548
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:32,260
<26-2,Cameron>你还好吗
<26-2,Cameron>You all right?

549
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:34,510
<26-3,John>是的
<26-3,John>Yes.

550
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:43,680
<26-4,Cameron>血栓阻止了血液
<26-4,Cameron>The sludge is blocking the blood

551
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:45,770
<26-4,Cameron>流进你脑部控制手臂的区域
<26-4,Cameron>flow to the part of the brain that controls your arm.

552
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:58,360
<26-4,Cameron>手术完成  你还好吗
<26-4,Cameron>All done. You still okay?

553
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:01,670
<26-5,John>是的
<26-5,John>I think so.

554
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,400
<27-1,Foreman>我也不知道  我想...
<27-1,Foreman>I don't know. I guess...

555
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:06,650
<27-1,Foreman>可能正是因为汉密尔顿
<27-1,Foreman>it's just with Dr. Hamilton here,

556
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,590
<27-1,Foreman>让我意识到了不同的行事风格
<27-1,Foreman>I-I noticed a difference in styles.

557
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:11,800
<27-2,House>你是说他很谦虚
<27-2,House>His style involves humility?

558
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:15,290
<27-2,House>我俩风格的另一个不同就是
<27-2,House>Another difference in our styles--

559
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:18,550
<27-2,House>道不道歉我觉得无所谓  你可以走了
<27-2,House>I don't care much for apologies. You can go.

560
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:21,250
<27-3,Foreman>我说话的时候  不知道你就站在我身后  好吧
<27-3,Foreman>I didn't know you were standing there when I said that, okay?

561
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:24,220
<27-4,House>-我那样实在太无礼了  -你觉得真正的谦虚
<27-4,House>- It was completely rude. - Do you mean genuine humility,

562
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:26,910
<27-4,House>是那种不断自我怀疑自我质疑的
<27-4,House>you know, with all the self-doubt and the self-questioning,

563
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:30,900
<27-4,House>还是汉密尔顿式的礼貌  盛气凌人表里不一的谦虚
<27-4,House>or Hamilton's polite, patronizing, "Aw, shucks" Humility?

564
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:32,800
<27-5,Foreman>-你们都是很出色的医生  -谢谢
<27-5,Foreman>- You're both excellent doctors. - Thank you.

565
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:35,150
<27-6,House>谦虚是种重要品质
<27-6,House>And humility is an important quality,

566
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:37,210
<27-6,House>尤其当你常常犯错的时候
<27-6,House>especially if you're wrong a lot.

567
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:39,370
<27-7,Foreman>可你几乎每一步都在犯错
<27-7,Foreman>You've been wrong every step of the way.

568
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,640
<27-8,House>当然  要是一直都对
<27-8,House>'Course, when you're right,

569
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,360
<27-8,House>那也没必要自我怀疑了  不是吗
<27-8,House>self-doubt doesn't help anybody, does it?

570
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:56,940
<27-8,House>该走了
<27-8,House>We gotta go.

571
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:05,950
<28-1,Hamilton>格雷戈  恭喜你
<28-1,Hamilton>Congratulations, Greg.

572
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,470
<28-2,House>恭喜  喜从何来  马丁
<28-2,House>Congratulations. Why, Marty?

573
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,960
<28-3,Cora>约翰醒了  手臂能动了
<28-3,Cora>John woke up. He can use his arm.

574
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:14,900
<28-4,John>谢谢你
<28-4,John>Thank you.

575
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:17,110
<28-5,Hamilton>我知道我们之间有分歧
<28-5,Hamilton>Now, look, I know we've had our differences,

576
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:18,940
<28-5,Hamilton>但只要某人做了好事
<28-5,Hamilton>but I think when a person does something well,

577
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:20,400
<28-5,Hamilton>还是该得到公认的
<28-5,Hamilton>it ought to be recognized.

578
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:22,190
<28-6,House>电话通的嘛
<28-6,House>The phone works.

579
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:24,060
<28-6,House>下次还想这么对我
<28-6,House>Next time you want to make me feel

580
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:26,270
<28-6,House>嘘寒问暖的时候  留言就行
<28-6,House>all warm and fuzzy, leave a message.

581
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:29,000
<28-6,House>别误会  我很为你高兴
<28-6,House>Don't get me wrong. I'm overcome with joy.

582
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:30,900
<28-7,John>-医生  -在
<28-7,John>- Doc. - Yeah.

583
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:33,980
<28-10,John>-什么  -你刚碰了我的腿
<28-10,John>- What? - You just touched my leg.

584
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:36,850
<28-11,House>怎么  还想再告我一次伤害罪
<28-11,House>What, are you gonna charge me with assault again?

585
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:38,340
<28-11,House>不是
<28-11,House>No.

586
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,010
<28-12,John>我感觉到了
<28-12,John>I felt it.

587
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,720
<29-1,House>他小腿以上  已经恢复知觉
<29-1,House>He now has feeling all the way up to the calf.

588
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:55,900
<29-1,House>药物起作用的方式就是这样
<29-1,House>This is the way medicine evolved.

589
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:58,330
<29-1,House>有时候病人情况好转
<29-1,House>Patients sometimes get better.

590
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,900
<29-1,House>我们却不知为何
<29-1,House>You have no idea why,

591
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,570
<29-1,House>除非知道什么在起作用  否则他们不会买账
<29-1,House>but unless you give a reason, they won't pay you.

592
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,710
<29-1,House>有没人注意过  是不是满月的影响
<29-1,House>Anybody notice if there's a full moon?

593
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:06,300
<29-2,Cameron>你是说  他就这么自己好转了
<29-2,Cameron>You're saying he just spontaneously got better?

594
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:08,870
<29-3,House>不  我是说我们得排除满月影响  然后继续
<29-3,House>No. I'm saying, let's rule out the lunar god and go from there.

595
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,520
<29-4,Chase>他用的某种药起了作用
<29-4,Chase>Something he's on is working.

596
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:14,140
<30-1,Hamilton>替代的药物起了作用  排除了A.L.S.可能
<30-1,Hamilton>The enzyme replacement protocol is working, reversing the A.L.S.

597
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:16,180
<30-2,Foreman>这时机你不觉得很可疑吗
<30-2,Foreman>The timing doesn't seem suspicious to you?

598
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,990
<30-3,Hamilton>你觉得豪斯医生也会这么认为吗
<30-3,Hamilton>Do you think Dr. House'll see it that way,

599
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:19,980
<30-3,Hamilton>认为是他的用药  起了作用
<30-3,Hamilton>figure it's his medication doin' the job?

600
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:21,390
<30-4,Foreman>肯定会的
<30-4,Foreman>I'm sure he will.

601
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:23,140
<31-1,House>是我们用的其中一种药
<31-1,House>It's one of ours.

602
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,270
<31-2,Cameron>那怎么能确定到底是哪种呢
<31-2,Cameron>How do we figure out which drug is doing the trick?

603
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:27,430
<31-3,House>简单  全部停用
<31-3,House>Easy. We just stop all of them.

604
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:29,710
<31-4,Cameron>-可其中一种在起作用  -但其他的
<31-4,Cameron>- One of those drugs is helping him. - And the rest--

605
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:32,770
<31-5,House>类固醇  抗生素  抗炎药
<31-5,House>steroids, antibiotics,anti-inflammatories--

606
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:34,710
<31-5,House>要是不同时停掉的话  是有毒的
<31-5,House>They're toxic, if we leave him on all of them.

607
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:36,810
<31-7,House>-可那样他就有能走了  -对  走去他自己葬礼
<31-7,House>- He'll walk again. - Yeah. To his own funeral.

608
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:39,060
<31-8,Chase>-但如果全部停药  他会恶化的  -对
<31-8,Chase>- But if we stop everything, he'll get worse. - True.

609
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:41,230
<31-9,House>所以得每次用回一种药
<31-9,House>We'll add our medications back one at a time.

610
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:42,950
<31-9,House>一旦出现好转  就能找到答案
<31-9,House>When he gets better, we'll have our answer.

611
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:45,740
<31-10,Cameron>-要是他没好转呢  -那我们就麻烦了
<31-10,Cameron>- And if he doesn't get better? - Then we're in trouble.

612
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:48,090
<31-11,House>当然没他麻烦大
<31-11,House>Not as much as he is.

613
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:50,330
<31-11,House>不过我猜你就是这个意思
<31-11,House>But I suppose that was your point.

614
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,800
<32-1,Foreman>我猜你想让我说服
<32-1,Foreman>I assume you want me to convince

615
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,270
<32-1,Foreman>-汉密尔顿停止治疗  -我不在乎
<32-1,Foreman>- Hamilton to stop his treatments too. - Don't care.

616
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:01,170
<32-3,Foreman>你该知道  他至少用过五种药
<32-3,Foreman>At least five of the medications are a part of his protocol.

617
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,360
<32-4,House>要是药管用
<32-4,House>If his stuff was helping,

618
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:04,110
<32-4,House>他几个月前就能打网球了
<32-4,House>the guy would be playing tennis months ago.

619
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,300
<32-4,House>肯定是我们的治疗在起作用
<32-4,House>It's our round of treatment that's helping.

620
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:08,500
<32-5,Foreman>没错  可你却又要全部停药
<32-5,Foreman>Right. So that's what you'll stop.

621
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:12,090
<32-5,Foreman>不会超过15到20分钟
<32-5,Foreman>It shouldn't be more than 15 or 20 minutes.

622
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,570
<33-1,Wilson>所以你认为  如果他们不想治疗
<33-1,Wilson>So your philosophy is, if they don't want treatment,

623
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,980
<33-1,Wilson>哪怕强行灌药也要给他治
<33-1,Wilson>they get it shoved down their throat,

624
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,530
<33-1,Wilson>但如果有可能治愈的话
<33-1,Wilson>but if it might cure their paralysis,

625
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:19,610
<33-1,Wilson>-最好还是悠着点来  -没错
<33-1,Wilson>- whoa, we better slow down. - Yeah.

626
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:20,790
<33-1,Wilson>是的医生  我就爱这样
<33-1,Wilson>Yes, Doctor, I love it.

627
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:23,130
<33-2,House>我之前的做法是听之任之
<33-2,House>My old philosophy used to be live and let live.

628
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:25,490
<33-2,House>可我越是研究下去
<33-2,House>But I'm taking this needlepoint class,

629
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:27,410
<33-2,House>越觉得任重而道远
<33-2,House>and they gave us these really big pillows.

630
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:29,800
<33-3,Wilson>那你怎么处理同事关系的
<33-3,Wilson>What's your philosophy on employee relations?

631
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,110
<33-4,House>那只是很小一块
<33-4,House>That's a very tiny pillow.

632
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,990
<33-5,Wilson>很好  看来你很清楚自己在做什么
<33-5,Wilson>Great. It sounds like you know what you're doing.

633
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:36,230
<33-5,Wilson>格雷戈
<33-5,Wilson>Greg.

634
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:39,660
<33-7,House>-能跟你谈谈吗  -能等到广告时间吗  马丁
<33-7,House>- Can I have a word? - Can it wait for the commercial, Marty?

635
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,750
<33-7,House>这位是我朋友吉米
<33-7,House>Say hi to my friend Jimmy.

636
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,490
<33-8,Hamilton>幸会
<33-8,Hamilton>Pleasure.

637
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:48,040
<33-8,Hamilton>你的诊断试验...
<33-8,Hamilton>Your diagnostic trial--

638
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:50,260
<33-9,House>说真的  还有5分钟就插播广告了
<33-9,House>Seriously, commercial's in about five minutes.

639
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:51,480
<33-10,Hamilton>实在太过危险
<33-10,Hamilton>That's a dangerous game.

640
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:53,150
<33-11,House>除非是坐浴缸里在看
<33-11,House>Only if we're watching in the bathtub.

641
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,100
<33-12,Hamilton>我需要确切知道
<33-12,Hamilton>I need to know exactly

642
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:56,950
<33-12,Hamilton>你给约翰·亨利用的什么药
<33-12,Hamilton>what medications you were giving John Henry.

643
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:58,940
<33-13,House>想都别想  如果福曼
<33-13,House>Forget it. And if Foreman

644
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,700
<33-13,House>私自告诉你约翰·亨利的用药记录
<33-13,House>tells you what John Henry used to be on--

645
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:03,070
<33-14,Hamilton>-你会解雇他吗  -不
<33-14,Hamilton>- You're gonna fire him? - Nope.

646
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:06,120
<33-15,House>我一定会让他做满两年合同期  才放他走
<33-15,House>I'll make him live out every day of his two-year contract.

647
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,750
<33-16,Wilson>-福曼想跳槽吗  -还没
<33-16,Wilson>- Foreman asked to leave? - Not yet.

648
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,000
<33-18,Hamilton>但你怎么知道我请他...
<33-18,Hamilton>But how do you know I made him--

649
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,510
<33-19,House>你虽然口蜜腹剑的  可不是白痴
<33-19,House>You're a polite twit, but you're not an idiot.

650
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:15,280
<33-20,Hamilton>我得知道  你到底给他停了什么药
<33-20,Hamilton>I need to know what medications you've taken him off of.

651
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,790
<33-21,House>等等  你不是白痴
<33-21,House>Wait a second. You're not an idiot.

652
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:27,350
<33-21,House>你得知道我到底停了什么药
<33-21,House>You need to know what medications I've stopped...

653
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:28,870
<33-21,House>是因为...
<33-21,House>because--

654
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,030
<34-1,House>情况恶化了
<34-1,House>He's getting worse.

655
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,440
<34-1,House>现在你还是我手下  跟我来
<34-1,House>Right now you still work for me. Come on.

656
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,320
<34-1,House>没有知觉  不能动弹
<34-1,House>No feeling. No wiggling.

657
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,620
<35-1,House>坏消息是约翰·亨利又回到了原点
<35-1,House>Bad news is John Henry's back where he started.

658
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:49,340
<35-1,House>好消息是汉密尔顿看上去灰头土脸的
<35-1,House>Good news is Hamilton looks bad.

659
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,050
<35-2,Foreman>是啊  你输赢都没关系
<35-2,Foreman>Yeah, it's not whether you win or lose.

660
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:52,340
<35-2,Foreman>只要别人输了就好
<35-2,Foreman>It's whether the other guy loses.

661
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,620
<35-3,House>我们给他用的第一个药是什么
<35-3,House>What was the first thing we put him on?

662
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,150
<35-4,Chase>类固醇  治疗肺炎
<35-4,Chase>Steroids, for the pneumonia.

663
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,860
<35-5,House>好  重新给他用  观察24小时看情况
<35-5,House>Well, put him back on them. Give him 24 hours. See what happens.

664
00:37:57,970 --> 00:37:59,070
<35-5,House>他肺部状况很不好
<35-5,House>His lungs aren't great.

665
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:01,160
<35-6,Cameron>类固醇很可能再次引起呼吸衰竭
<35-6,Cameron>They might cause another respiratory collapse.

666
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:03,060
<35-7,House>希望不会  我可不怎么喜欢那律师
<35-7,House>Sure hope not. I didn't much like that lawyer.

667
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:05,600
<35-8,Foreman>-做核磁共振  -已经做过  还做了血管造影
<35-8,Foreman>- And get an M.R.I. - He already got one, and an M.R.A.

668
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:07,790
<35-9,House>很明显情况有变  再做一次
<35-9,House>Well, obviously something is different now. Do it again.

669
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:10,580
<35-9,House>奇斯负责扫描  卡梅隆给他用类固醇
<35-9,House>Chase, take care of the scan. Cameron, put him on the steroids.

670
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:15,700
<35-9,House>我们真该好好谈谈  是吧
<35-9,House>We should probably talk, huh?

671
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:24,120
<36-1,Chase>-薄切面  -扫描哪里
<36-1,Chase>- Thin cuts. - What levels?

672
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:27,330
<36-3,Chase>贯穿整个脊髓尾  跟上次一样
<36-3,Chase>T-9 through the cauda equina, same as the last time.

673
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,060
<36-3,Chase>你觉得豪斯会同意
<36-3,Chase>You really think House would

674
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:32,690
<36-3,Chase>-让福曼提前解约吗  -他没得选
<36-3,Chase>- let Foreman out of his contract? - He has to.

675
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,500
<36-4,Cameron>不同意就表示他需要福曼
<36-4,Cameron>If he doesn't, he's telling Foreman he needs him.

676
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,200
<36-4,Cameron>豪斯可做不到
<36-4,Cameron>House can't handle that.

677
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:43,480
<36-4,Cameron>天哪
<36-4,Cameron>Oh, my God.

678
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:50,460
<37-1,House>我查过他资料
<37-1,House>I checked him out.

679
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:53,620
<37-1,House>是位很不错的医生
<37-1,House>He's a great doctor.

680
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:59,500
<37-2,Foreman>-你觉得他比我好吗  -这关系你的自我认同吗
<37-2,Foreman>- You think he's better than I am?  - This about your ego?

681
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:01,570
<37-3,House>回答我的问题
<37-3,House>Answer the question.

682
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:05,840
<37-3,House>那不会改变我的自我认同
<37-3,House>It's not gonna change how I think about myself.

683
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:07,750
<37-3,House>但可能会影响我对你的看法
<37-3,House>Might affect my opinion of you,

684
00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:10,120
<37-3,House>但也不该影响你的自我认同
<37-3,House>but that shouldn't affect your opinion of yourself.

685
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:13,040
<37-1,House>有点儿晕
<37-1,House>Now I'm getting confused.

686
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:15,260
<37-1,House>如果你认为他比我好
<37-1,House>If you think he's a better doctor than I am,

687
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:16,380
<37-3,House>你就该接受那份工作
<37-3,House>then you should take the job.

688
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,540
<37-3,House>否则  就再让他多请你吃两三次
<37-3,House>Otherwise, you should get him to buy you

689
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:22,470
<37-3,House>套老交情的美餐  然后婉拒他
<37-3,House>two or three more nostalgic lunches and then politely decline.

690
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:25,820
<37-4,Foreman>就这么简单  我就该忍气吞声  忘记你的辱骂吗
<37-4,Foreman>It's that simple? I should just ignore the mockery and abuse?

691
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:28,560
<37-5,House>-我哪有辱骂你  -你怎么没有
<37-5,House>- Oh, how do I abuse you? - How do you not?

692
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:31,670
<37-7,House>-我稍有犯错...  -我对你负有责任  这样怎么了
<37-7,House>- If I make a mistake-- - I hold you accountable. So what?

693
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,400
<37-8,Foreman>汉密尔顿医生就会原谅
<37-8,Foreman>Dr. Hamilton forgives.

694
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:36,510
<37-9,House>-他就能做到不再追究  -他才不是这样
<37-9,House>- He's capable of moving on. - That is not what he does.

695
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,500
<37-10,Foreman>他的病人我差点搞砸
<37-10,Foreman>I screwed up his case.

696
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:39,470
<37-11,House>-他却跟我说...  -他从没说过原谅你
<37-11,House>- He told me-- - He never said you were forgiven.

697
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,650
<37-11,House>我也在场  他只是说不是你的错
<37-11,House>I was there. He said it wasn't your fault.

698
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:43,570
<37-12,Foreman>-所以呢  -所以那就是你的错
<37-12,Foreman>- So? - So, it was.

699
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:46,550
<37-13,House>你冒了险  你做得很棒
<37-13,House>You took a chance. You did something great.

700
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:48,910
<37-13,House>你犯过错  可结果仍然很棒
<37-13,House>You were wrong, but it was still great.

701
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:50,440
<37-13,House>病人好转  你本就应该高兴
<37-13,House>You should feel great that it was great.

702
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,850
<37-13,House>病人恶化  你就该觉得糟糕
<37-13,House>You should feel like crap that it was wrong.

703
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,200
<37-13,House>那就是我跟他的不同
<37-13,House>That's the difference between him and me.

704
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,790
<37-13,House>他觉得医生就是份工作  该怎样就怎样
<37-13,House>He thinks you do your job, and what will be will be.

705
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:59,150
<37-13,House>我却认为当医生  一举一动都至关重要
<37-13,House>I think that what I do and what you do matters.

706
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:03,870
<37-13,House>他晚上能夜夜安眠  他不该这样
<37-13,House>He sleeps better at night. He shouldn't.

707
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,680
<37-14,Cameron>是动静脉血管畸形
<37-14,Cameron>Arteriovenous malformation.

708
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:10,960
<37-15,Chase>在硬膜内  压迫着他的脊柱
<37-15,Chase>Intradural. Compressing his spine.

709
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:14,560
<37-16,House>导致瘫痪
<37-16,House>Causing his paralysis.

710
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:17,410
<37-17,Foreman>汉密尔顿怎么会连动静脉畸形都没查出来
<37-17,Foreman>How could Hamilton have missed an A.V.M.?

711
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:18,960
<37-18,House>我们之前也没
<37-18,House>Well, we missed it too,

712
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:21,330
<37-18,House>因为之前并不在那里
<37-18,House>'cause it wasn't there before.

713
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,900
<37-19,Chase>你是说一夜之间长出来的
<37-19,Chase>Are you saying it just grew overnight?

714
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,210
<37-19,Chase>不
<37-19,Chase>No.

715
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:29,160
<37-20,House>本来就压迫在脊柱上  只是没拍出来
<37-20,House>It was on the spine. It wasn't on the M.R.I.

716
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:33,540
<37-20,House>-结构位置相同  -那里没有
<37-20,House>- Same anatomic location. - It's not there.

717
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,310
<37-22,House>-那里到底有什么  -什么都没有
<37-22,House>- Well, what is there? - Nothing.

718
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:40,330
<37-24,House>或者看上去什么都没有
<37-24,House>Or something that looks like nothing.

719
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:45,490
<37-25,Cameron>-扫描时有背景噪音  是静电干扰  -是瘢痕组织  还是炎症
<37-25,Cameron>- Background noise. Static. - Scar tissue? Inflammation?

720
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:48,060
<37-27,Foreman>如果是炎症  类固醇早就治好了
<37-27,Foreman>If it's inflammation, the steroids would've shrunk it down.

721
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:50,950
<37-28,House>考虑到是动静脉畸形
<37-28,House>Revealing the A.V.M.,

722
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:54,330
<37-28,House>肯定早就存在  只是被肿胀的发炎部位挡住了
<37-28,House>which has always been there, hiding behind its own swelling.

723
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,910
<37-28,House>类固醇消除了炎症  就能看出来了
<37-28,House>We remove that, he'll walk again.

724
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:46,500
<37-28,House>豪斯医生
<37-28,House>Dr. House.

725
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:50,930
<38-1,John>科拉在外面准备了豪华轿车来接我
<38-1,John>Cora's meeting me outside with the limo.

726
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:53,880
<38-1,John>我终于可以出院了
<38-1,John>I'm bein' discharged.

727
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:57,020
<38-2,House>五十块赌我能把你打到外面
<38-2,House>Fifty bucks says I can beat you to the curb.

728
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,630
<38-3,John>谢谢你没有放弃治疗
<38-3,John>Thanks for stickin' with the case.

729
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:02,400
<38-4,House>我又不会做别的
<38-4,House>I can't do anything else.

730
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:07,380
<38-4,House>能走路了  你倒容易取悦多了
<38-4,House>You're much more easily amused when you can walk.

731
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:08,520
<38-5,John>多奇怪啊
<38-5,John>How bizarre.

732
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:12,210
<38-5,John>要我猜  即使你腿还没坏的时候
<38-5,John>I'm guessing that you weren't exactly Mr. Sunshine...

733
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:13,960
<38-5,John>你也不是整天笑容满面的人
<38-5,John>even before your leg got messed up.

734
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,060
<38-5,John>我想给你这个
<38-5,John>I want you to have this.

735
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:33,220
<38-7,John>随便你高兴卖掉还是怎样
<38-7,John>You can sell it if you want to.

736
00:42:33,330 --> 00:42:35,080
<38-7,John>只要你保证不吹
<38-7,John>Just promise me you won't play it.

737
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:42,040
<38-7,John>你那药都吃多少片了
<38-7,John>How many of those pills you takin'?

738
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:45,400
<38-8,House>我很痛苦
<38-8,House>I'm in pain.

739
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:48,680
<38-8,House>是啊
<38-8,House>Yes.

740
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:52,220
<38-9,John>谁不是呢
<38-9,John>Aren't we all?

741
00:42:55,170 --> 00:42:57,830
<38-9,John>你那手杖哪里买的  真有专卖店吗
<38-9,John>So where do you buy these things? Do they have cane stores?

742
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:58,920
<38-10,House>别担心
<38-10,House>Ah, don't worry about it.

743
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,790
<38-10,House>没等你用坏一根  你就能跑步了
<38-10,House>You'll be jogging before you need a second one.

744
00:43:02,170 --> 00:43:03,560
<38-10,House>明天见  艾瑞克
<38-10,House>See you tomorrow, Eric.
