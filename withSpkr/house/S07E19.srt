95
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:22,190
<5-13,Masters>可能是单纯性脱水
<5-13,Masters>Could be simple dehydration.

96
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:25,460
<5-13,Masters>她跟海警说她感觉到头晕
<5-13,Masters>She told the coast guard she had felt dizzy.

<5-15,Masters>其实我还没决定呢
<5-15,Masters>Actually, I'm still deciding.

102
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:40,300
<5-15,Masters>也许她癫痫发作
<5-15,Masters>Maybe she had a seizure

103
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,600
<5-15,Masters>从而导致了昏迷
<5-15,Masters>and that's what caused her collapse.

104
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:44,780
<5-16,Thirteen>海警的报告上说没有头部外伤
<5-16,Thirteen>Coast guard report says no sign of head trauma.

107
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:48,710
<5-17,Taub>就在昏倒前
<5-17,Taub>Right before the collapse,

108
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,400
<5-17,Taub>她的背部撞上了栏杆
<5-17,Taub>she hit the small of her back on the railing.

109
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:52,910
<5-17,Taub>肾上腺受损引起肾上腺素水平不足
<5-17,Taub>Damaged adrenal glands caused adrenal insufficiencies,

110
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:54,850
<5-17,Taub>进而导致了昏迷

111
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:56,740
<5-17,Taub>不错

00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,120
<5-18,House>人生没有错误的选择
<5-18,House>There's no wrong choices.

116
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,580
<5-18,House>至少大家在安慰那些选择错误的人时
<5-18,House>At least, that's what they tell people

117
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,880
<5-18,House>都是这么说的
<5-18,House>who make crappy choices.

118
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:11,300
<5-19,Chase>你怎么突然对她的未来这么感兴趣
<5-19,Chase>What's with the sudden interest in her future?

119
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:13,730
<5-20,House>当一名铁匠日日夜夜挥洒光阴
<5-20,House>You know, a blacksmith who spends this much time

120
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,900
<5-20,House>终将一块生铁铸成一柄利刃之后
<5-20,House>hammering out a new blade from raw jell-o

121
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,960
<5-20,House>就会好奇它最后会落在谁手里
<5-20,House>gets curious about who ends up wielding it.

122
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,090
<5-21,Foreman>除非是你自己想用
<5-21,Foreman>No reason to be curious

123
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:22,710
<5-21,Foreman>不然就没理由好奇
<5-21,Foreman>unless you're interested in wielding it yourself.

124
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:25,150
<5-21,Foreman>你想让她在这里实习
<5-21,Foreman>You want her to intern here.

125
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,280
<5-22,Taub>而你还真在考虑这事呢
<5-22,Taub>And you're considering this?

126
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:30,030
<5-23,Masters>在我决定之前
<5-23,Masters>Before I make my decision,

127
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,330
<6-3,Kendall>我还有一个腰穿没完成
<6-3,Kendall>I still have one more L.P.

<6-4,Bobby>我得去做了
<6-4,Bobby>I need to get.

129
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:36,820
<5-23,Masters>所以我要去下急诊室
<5-23,Masters>So I'd like to go to the E.R.

130
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,690
<5-24,House>十三  你干嘛不带上马斯特斯
<5-24,House>Thirteen, why don't you take Masters

131
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,100
<5-24,House>去抽血呢
<5-24,House>to do the blood draws?

132
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:46,080
<5-24,House>可以顺便提点她  在我手下做事多牛逼
<5-24,House>You can remind her about all the perks of working for me.

00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:53,760
<6-1,Kendall>甲板后方  左舷
<6-1,Kendall>Behind the deck, port side.

134
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:56,260
<6-2,Thirteen>如果她肾上腺素水平持续偏低
<6-2,Thirteen>If her adrenal hormone levels are consistently low,

135
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,640
<6-2,Thirteen>我们将采用替代疗法
<6-2,Thirteen>we'll replace them.

136
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,600
<6-2,Thirteen>周四你就可以出海了
<6-2,Thirteen>You'll be ready to launch on Thursday.

137
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,410

139
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:06,270
<6-4,Bobby>小凯  抱歉  我得跟你妈妈说句话
<6-4,Bobby>Sorry, K, I need to borrow mom.

140
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:07,130
<6-5,Paige>是赞助商吗
<6-5,Paige>The sponsors?

141
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,360
<6-6,Bobby>不  库里克的人没事找事
<6-6,Bobby>No, Couric's people kicking up a fuss

142
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:10,560
<6-6,Bobby>要求重新安排采访时间
<6-6,Bobby>about rescheduling the interview.

143
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,250
<6-7,Masters>那我来吧
<6-7,Masters>I can take over.

144
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,980
<6-8,Kendall>船内厨房的天花板
<6-8,Kendall>Ceiling of the galley.

145
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,310
<6-9,Masters>答对了  我上一次坐船
<6-9,Masters>Right. The last time I was on a boat

146
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,470
<6-9,Masters>还是在大学新生联谊的时候呢
<6-9,Masters>was my freshman mixer in college.

147
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:28,150
<6-9,Masters>不过没怎么联谊  光顾着吐了
<6-9,Masters>I didn't so much mix as hurl.

148
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:31,750
<6-10,Kendall>-喝多了吗  -没  我那时才13岁
<6-10,Kendall>- Too much to drink? - No, I was 13.

149
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,280
<6-12,Kendall>就上大学了吗
<6-12,Kendall>And in college?

150
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:35,170
<6-13,Masters>是啊  我知道  挺稀奇的
<6-13,Masters>Yeah, I know. Weird.

151
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:38,000
<6-14,Kendall>我想说  这太牛了
<6-14,Kendall>I was thinking "Cool."

152
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:40,420
<6-15,Thirteen>我们十五分钟后再回来抽下一管血
<6-15,Thirteen>We'll be back for the next blood draw in 15 minutes.

153
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,740
<6-15,Thirteen>当然  要是你想留在这里
<6-15,Thirteen>Unless, of course, you'd like to stay,

154
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:44,590
<6-15,Thirteen>继续追忆你们遗失的童年也行
<6-15,Thirteen>and continue bonding over your lost childhoods.

155
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,630
<6-16,Kendall>出海前我有一大堆的准备工作要做
<6-16,Kendall>Listen, I have a ton of prep work to do to be ready to launch.

156
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,800
<6-16,Kendall>能不能快点做完化验
<6-16,Kendall>Is there any way we can speed the tests up?

157
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:51,450
<6-17,Thirteen>恐怕不行
<6-17,Thirteen>I'm afraid not.

158
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,280
<6-18,Masters>除非做平板运动试验
<6-18,Masters>Unless you're up for getting on a treadmill.

159
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,420
<6-18,Masters>增加身体负荷
<6-18,Masters>We could stress her body.

160
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:56,650
<6-18,Masters>观察肾上腺反应
<6-18,Masters>See if her adrenals respond.

161
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:58,700
<6-18,Masters>只用半个小时就够了
<6-18,Masters>It would only take a half an hour.

162
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,990
<6-21,Thirteen>-叫我做腰穿的  -去吧  这里我来搞定
<6-21,Thirteen>- It's about an LP. - Go. I'll handle this.

163
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:14,680
<6-21,Thirteen>卡迪医生
<6-21,Thirteen>Dr. Cuddy,

164
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:15,780
<7-1,Masters>我一会儿能去办公室找您吗
<7-1,Masters>can I come by your office later?

165
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:17,290
<7-1,Masters>有件事想咨询一下
<7-1,Masters>I'd love to get some advice.

166
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,380
<7-2,Cuddy>我一下午都要开会
<7-2,Cuddy>I'm in meetings all afternoon.

167
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,680
<7-2,Cuddy>-明天或许有空  -明天啊
<7-2,Cuddy>- Try me tomorrow. - Tomorrow?

168
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:23,340
<7-2,Cuddy>这...
<7-2,Cuddy>This is...

169
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:24,330
<7-3,Masters>今天是我作为医科学生的
<7-3,Masters>This is my last day

170
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,810
<7-3,Masters>最后一天了
<7-3,Masters>as a medical student.

171
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,620
<7-3,Masters>我必须做出决定
<7-3,Masters>So I've got this decision to make.

172
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:29,950
<7-3,Masters>这大概是我职业生涯中最重要的决定
<7-3,Masters>Probably the biggest decision of my career.

173
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,360
<7-3,Masters>甚至可能是我整个人生中最重要的决定
<7-3,Masters>Which means maybe the biggest decision of my life.

174
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:37,250
<7-3,Masters>尽管  如果我要结婚的话...
<7-3,Masters>Although, I guess, if I get married...

175
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:41,310
<7-3,Masters>豪斯在招实习生
<7-3,Masters>House has opened up an internship.

176
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,490
<7-4,Cuddy>你清楚如果你去了
<7-4,Cuddy>You do realize if you take it,

177
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,710
<7-4,Cuddy>他很有可能又炒了你吧
<7-4,Cuddy>he'll probably end up firing you again?

178
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,920
<7-5,Masters>他总是会把我再雇回来的
<7-5,Masters>He's always hired me back.

179
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:49,450
<7-6,Cuddy>只要一有机会  他就会不停地
<7-6,Cuddy>And he'll continue mocking and insulting you,

180
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,580
<7-6,Cuddy>嘲笑你羞辱你
<7-6,Cuddy>whatever chance he gets.

181
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,980
<7-7,Masters>但这加强了我的心理承受力
<7-7,Masters>It's certainly toughened me up.

182
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:58,130
<7-7,Masters>你想让我替他说好话
<7-7,Masters>You're trying to get me to say good things about him.

183
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:01,090
<7-8,Cuddy>没  我只想让你自己做决定
<7-8,Cuddy>No. I'm trying to make you make your own decision,

184
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:03,220
<7-8,Cuddy>我好清净会儿
<7-8,Cuddy>and leave me alone.

185
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:06,750
<7-8,Cuddy>和豪斯共事很不错
<7-8,Cuddy>Working with House is great.

186
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:07,880
<7-8,Cuddy>但也很郁闷
<7-8,Cuddy>and it sucks,

187
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:09,930
<7-8,Cuddy>经常会同时有这两种感觉
<7-8,Cuddy>often simultaneously.

188
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,090
<7-8,Cuddy>大多数人受不了那种环境
<7-8,Cuddy>Most people can't work in that environment.

189
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,600
<7-8,Cuddy>问题是
<7-8,Cuddy>Question is...

190
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,950
<7-8,Cuddy>你呢
<7-8,Cuddy>can you?

191
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,300
<7-9,Masters>谢谢您  卡迪医生
<7-9,Masters>Thanks, Dr. Cuddy.

192
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,660
<8-1,Masters>你把我呼下来  却抢了我的腰穿
<8-1,Masters>You paged me down here and now you're doing my LP?

193
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:40,600
<8-2,Cruz>我等烦了
<8-2,Cruz>I got bored waiting.

194
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:41,920
<8-3,Masters>才两分钟啊
<8-3,Masters>It's been two minutes.

195
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,850
<8-3,Masters>-你都做11次了  -是第14次
<8-3,Masters>- This is your 11th. - 14th.

196
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:44,890
<8-4,Cruz>我说  你的室友是不是
<8-4,Cruz>Listen, your roommate,

197
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:47,740
<8-4,Cruz>在跟那个住院医交往啊
<8-4,Cruz>is she hooking up with that resident?

198
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,860
<8-5,Masters>我去找豪斯
<8-5,Masters>I got to find House.

199
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,930
<8-5,Masters>马斯特斯  我在急诊
<8-5,Masters>--豪斯

200
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,270
<8-5,Masters>戒毒  这借口真不错
<8-5,Masters>Rehab? Great cover story.

201
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,270
<9-1,Thirteen>我现在都不能跟他们一起喝酒了
<9-1,Thirteen>Now I can't ever drink around those guys again,

202
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,390
<9-1,Thirteen>我和奇斯就靠这个联络感情呢
<9-1,Thirteen>thus eliminating my main bond with Chase.

203
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:22,530
<9-2,House>把你的抱怨留给那些
<9-2,House>Save the attitude for someone

204
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,540
<9-2,House>不能为你要回行医执照的人吧
<9-2,House>who didn't just get you your medical license back.

205
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,960
<9-2,House>凡事都有代价
<9-2,House>Price you pay.

206
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:29,460
<9-3,Masters>你办公室里有只鸡
<9-3,Masters>There's a chicken in your office.

207
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,280
<9-4,House>没有
<9-4,House>No, there isn't.

208
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:33,440
<9-5,Masters>你说去戒毒是骗人的吗
<9-5,Masters>You lied about rehab?

209
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:34,930
<9-6,Thirteen>-真是太好了  -放松点
<9-6,Thirteen>- Oh, great. - Relax.

210
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:37,200
<9-7,House>她特别的诚实  也特别的无聊
<9-7,House>She's completely honest, but also completely boring.

211
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:40,240
<9-7,House>看好了  不准说出去
<9-7,House>Watch this. Don't tell anyone.

212
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:42,230
<9-8,Masters>当然不会了
<9-8,Masters>Of course not.

213
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:47,970
<9-8,Masters>你刚做了腰穿吗  为什么不叫我
<9-8,Masters>You did an LP? Why didn't you page me?

214
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:50,350
<9-9,House>不好意思  你想做一个吗
<9-9,House>Oh, I'm sorry. Did you want to do one of those?

215
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,990
<9-9,House>那你应该开口告诉我呀
<9-9,House>You should've spoken up.

216
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,170
<9-9,House>你想不想要这份工作
<9-9,House>You want the job or not?

217
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:56,930
<9-10,Masters>经过慎重考虑
<9-10,Masters>I-- after careful consideration,

218
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:03,050
<9-10,Masters>我决定  接受这份实习
<9-10,Masters>I have decided to accept your offer for an internship.

219
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,460
<9-6,Thirteen>不错
<9-6,Thirteen>Great.

220
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:08,680
<9-11,House>我的科室对实习记录的要求不太一样
<9-11,House>My department has a slightly different procedure log.

221
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:10,530
<9-12,Masters>你刚伪造了最后一次记录
<9-12,Masters>Uh, you forged the last one.

222
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:12,040
<9-12,Masters>我只做过九次腰穿
<9-12,Masters>I only did nine LPs.

223
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:14,230
<9-13,House>-知道怎么做腰穿吗  -当然了
<9-13,House>- Do you know how to do an LP? - Of course.

224
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,270
<9-15,House>知道怎么把做过九次说成十次吗
<9-15,House>Do you know how to do nine LPs and say it was ten?

225
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:20,460
<9-15,House>成熟点儿吧
<9-15,House>It's time to grow up.

226
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:23,070
<9-15,House>把表交上  工作就是你的了
<9-15,House>Turn that in, the job's yours.

227
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,690
<9-15,House>别傻盯着我了  走吧
<9-15,House>Stop staring blankly and go.

228
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:29,530
<9-15,House>很显然  咱们的病号
<9-15,House>No doubt something horrible has

229
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:32,130
<9-15,House>刚才出事了
<9-15,House>just happened to our patient.

230
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,650
<10-1,Thirteen>就在平板运动试验的时候
<10-1,Thirteen>Her hand turned completely blue,

231
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:43,800
<10-1,Thirteen>她整只手变成淤蓝色了
<10-1,Thirteen>during the treadmill test.

232
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,950
<10-1,Thirteen>我们用了血管舒张药
<10-1,Thirteen>We put her on vasodilators.

233
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,320
<10-1,Thirteen>血液循环得以恢复才不用截掉手指
<10-1,Thirteen>Restored enough blood flow so she won't lose any fingers.

234
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:49,690
<10-2,Foreman>排除了肾上腺素不足
<10-2,Foreman>Rules out adrenal insufficiency.

235
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:51,240
<10-2,Foreman>豪斯呢  他说在这等他啊
<10-2,Foreman>Where's House? He said to meet him here.

236
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:52,710
<10-3,Masters>他的鸡不见了
<10-3,Masters>His chicken's gone.

237
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:54,890
<10-4,Chase>大概在阳台上呢
<10-4,Chase>Probably on the balcony.

238
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,230
<10-5,Masters>你知道他有只鸡吗
<10-5,Masters>You knew he had a chicken?

239
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:59,620
<10-5,Masters>-怎么可能  -在这呢
<10-5,Masters>- How come--? - Down here!

240
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:04,450
<10-6,House>意识丧失  外加她慢慢出淤变蓝
<10-6,House>Loss of consciousness. Plus she's slowly turning blue.

241
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,480
<10-6,House>我们能排除魔法口香糖吗
<10-6,House>Can we rule out magical gum?

243
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,730
<10-7,Chase>心输出量不足会导致这两种症状
<10-7,Chase>Low cardiac output can cause both.

244
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,060
<10-7,Chase>病人可能患有心肌病
<10-7,Chase>Patient possibly has cardiomyopathy.

245
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,020
<10-7,Chase>也许是由汞中毒引起的
<10-7,Chase>Possibly caused by mercury poisoning

246
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,860
<10-7,Chase>就来自她在海上吃的金枪鱼
<10-7,Chase>from all the tuna fish she eats at sea.

247
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:16,000
<10-8,Masters>你为什么要把鸡爪印
<10-8,Masters>Why are you putting,

248
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,180
<10-8,Masters>印到地板上
<10-8,Masters>chicken footprints on the floor?

249
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:23,080
<10-9,House>威尔森那聪明的混蛋弄了只澳洲黑鸡
<10-9,House>That clever bastard Wilson got a hold of an australorp.

250
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,140
<10-10,Masters>你们不知道吗
<10-10,Masters>Hello.

251
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:28,830
<10-11,House>那是所有鸡里面最沉着冷静的
<10-11,House>The quietest and calmest of all the chickens.

252
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,510
<10-12,Taub>他真该死
<10-12,Taub>Damn him.

253
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,160
<10-12,Taub>汞中毒可以排除了
<10-12,Taub>Mercury poisoning is out.

254
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:34,290
<10-12,Taub>红细胞形态正常
<10-12,Taub>Red blood cells have normal morphology.

255
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,040
<10-13,Thirteen>雷诺病
<10-13,Thirteen>Raynaud's.

256
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:37,700
<10-13,Thirteen>尺动脉血管痉挛可以解释手部症状
<10-13,Thirteen>Vasospasm in the ulnar artery would explain the hand.

257
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,020
<10-14,Foreman>但无法解释意识丧失
<10-14,Foreman>But not the loss of consciousness.

258
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,250
<10-14,Foreman>脑动脉痉挛可以解释两种症状
<10-14,Foreman>Cerebral vasospasm explains both.

259
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,430
<10-15,House>脑动脉痉挛说得通
<10-15,House>Cerebral vasospasm makes sense.

260
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,270
<10-15,House>带上十三
<10-15,House>Take Thirteen.

261
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,530
<10-15,House>在病人的脑基底动脉注入
<10-15,House>Give the patient a calcium channel blocker infusion

262
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,550
<10-15,House>钙离子通道阻滞剂
<10-15,House>in the basilar artery.

263
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:51,430
<10-15,House>马斯特斯
<10-15,House>Masters.

264
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,680
<10-15,House>我以为你刚才已经把那个交了
<10-15,House>I thought you were going to turn that in.

265
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:57,010
<10-16,Masters>我  刚才一直在忙病人的事
<10-16,Masters>I... been busy with my patient.

266
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,830
<10-17,House>现在不忙吧
<10-17,House>You're not busy now.

267
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:11,620
<10-17,House>咕咕  咕咕
<10-17,House>Bawwwwwwk bawk.

268
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:25,110
<10-17,House>马斯特斯
<10-17,House>Masters.

269
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,290
<11-1,Donovan>还没交你的记录表吗
<11-1,Donovan>Still haven't turned in your log?

270
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,010
<11-2,Masters>还没完成第十次腰椎穿刺呢
<11-2,Masters>Still haven't gotten my tenth LP.

271
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:33,550
<11-3,Donovan>我在想也许你应该去豪斯那里实习
<11-3,Donovan>I was thinking maybe you should take House's internship.

272
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,400
<11-4,Masters>你开始的反应就好像
<11-4,Masters>First you act like it's the equivalent

273
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:36,960
<11-4,Masters>去那就跟自愿接受水刑一样
<11-4,Masters>of volunteering to be waterboarded

274
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,220
<11-4,Masters>现在你又支持我去了吗
<11-4,Masters>and now you're supporting it?

275
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:43,080
<11-4,Masters>你很奇怪
<11-4,Masters>You're weird.

276
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,140
<11-5,Donovan>你以叠纸飞机为乐
<11-5,Donovan>You make paper airplanes for fun

277
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,150
<11-5,Donovan>还把它们挂在天花板上
<11-5,Donovan>and hang them from the ceiling.

278
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:49,180
<11-5,Donovan>你是爱因斯坦博物馆的会员
<11-5,Donovan>You have a membership to the Einstein museum

279
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,930
<11-5,Donovan>疯狂的迷恋面部对称学说
<11-5,Donovan>and an overbearing obsession with facial symmetry.

280
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,510
<11-6,Masters>那意味着没有患病
<11-6,Masters>It indicates freedom from disease.

281
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:55,280
<11-6,Masters>从生物学角度上我们都是...
<11-6,Masters>We're biologically programmed--

282
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,450
<11-7,Donovan>重点是
<11-7,Donovan>The point is

283
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,180
<11-7,Donovan>你和别人相处的方式有问题
<11-7,Donovan>you rub people the wrong way.

284
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,950
<11-7,Donovan>但豪斯可以接受你这种态度
<11-7,Donovan>But House is okay with your lack of bedside manner.

285
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:03,740
<11-7,Donovan>也接受你敢于挑战任何人任何观点的行为
<11-7,Donovan>He's okay with your willingness to argue any point with anyone

286
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:05,690
<11-7,Donovan>即使是面对资历比你深的人
<11-7,Donovan>even if they outrank you.

287
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,340
<11-7,Donovan>他还可以接受你怪异的审美观点
<11-7,Donovan>He's okay with your peculiar fashion sense.

288
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,400
<11-8,Masters>这很奇怪吗
<11-8,Masters>It's peculiar?

289
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:10,720
<11-9,Donovan>豪斯不觉得你诡异
<11-9,Donovan>House doesn't think you're weird,

290
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:12,170
<11-9,Donovan>这点已经很诡异了
<11-9,Donovan>which is weird,

291
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,150
<11-9,Donovan>但这是好事
<11-9,Donovan>but good weird.

292
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:16,620
<11-9,Donovan>那是只鸡吗
<11-9,Donovan>Is that a chicken?

293
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:24,820
<11-10,Masters>我看是澳洲黑鸡
<11-10,Masters>I think it's an australorp.

294
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,190
<11-10,Masters>我要去检查病人了
<11-10,Masters>I'm gonna go check on my patient.

295
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,290
<12-1,Masters>有人能跟我解释下
<12-1,Masters>Can someone please explain to me

296
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:41,300
<12-1,Masters>豪斯和威尔森
<12-1,Masters>what House and Wilson

297
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,810
<12-1,Masters>在拿那些鸡做什么吗
<12-1,Masters>are doing with those chickens?

298
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,090
<12-2,Thirteen>他们在赌谁在医院里养的鸡
<12-2,Thirteen>They have a bet to see who can keep a chicken

299
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:47,530
<12-2,Thirteen>会最后被保安发现
<12-2,Thirteen>in the hospital the longest without getting busted by security.

300
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,330
<12-2,Thirteen>已通过椎动脉
<12-2,Thirteen>Advancing past the vertebral artery.

301
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:52,490
<12-3,Masters>他们为什么要这么做呢
<12-3,Masters>And why are they doing this?

302
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,640
<12-4,Foreman>他俩买鸡的地方只剩一头猪了
<12-4,Foreman>The place they bought them only had one pig.

303
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:58,530
<12-4,Foreman>很高兴今天过后你还会留在这里
<12-4,Foreman>I'm glad you're gonna be sticking around after today.

304
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,410
<12-5,Masters>真的吗  你希望我留下来
<12-5,Masters>Really? You want me to stay?

305
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:03,010
<12-6,Foreman>部门里能有不同观点是好事
<12-6,Foreman>It's good to add a different perspective to the department.

306
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,740
<12-6,Foreman>至少有人能记住除了豪斯的法则外
<12-6,Foreman>Someone who still remembers there are rules

307
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:05,970
<12-6,Foreman>还有其他准则要遵守
<12-6,Foreman>other than House's.

308
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:10,350
<12-7,Masters>如果我不按豪斯的规矩做
<12-7,Masters>If I don't play by House's rules,

309
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,620
<12-7,Masters>他不会让我加入的
<12-7,Masters>he won't let me in.

310
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:14,600
<12-8,Foreman>想个办法糊弄他
<12-8,Foreman>Find a way around them.

311
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:18,920
<12-9,Masters>那我就得对他撒谎  那还是得撒谎
<12-9,Masters>I'd have to lie to him, which is still lying.

312
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:19,740
<12-10,Thirteen>用谎言掩盖谎言
<12-10,Thirteen>Lying about a lie,

313
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:21,600
<12-10,Thirteen>也算是陈述事实了
<12-10,Thirteen>that's practically telling the truth.

314
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,430
<12-10,Thirteen>导管插进去了
<12-10,Thirteen>Catheter's in.

315
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,420
<12-10,Thirteen>开始钙离子通道阻滞剂静脉滴注
<12-10,Thirteen>Start the calcium channel blocker drip.

316
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:26,150
<12-11,Masters>就是说我需要再做一次腰椎穿刺
<12-11,Masters>Means I need another LP.

317
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,250
<12-12,Thirteen>你太幸运了  我正好知道谁需要做
<12-12,Thirteen>Luckily, I know where you can get one.

318
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,820
<12-12,Thirteen>你能搞定吗  我们走
<12-12,Thirteen>You good here? Let's go.

319
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:39,850
<13-1,Thirteen>插入过程不错  很熟练
<13-1,Thirteen>Decent stick. Very smooth.

320
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,510
<13-2,Masters>听上去你做过好几次了
<13-2,Masters>Sounds like you've had a few of these.

321
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,050
<13-2,Masters>似乎我哪壶不开提哪壶了
<13-2,Masters>Suppose that comes with the territory.

322
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,700
<13-3,Thirteen>我有亨廷顿病
<13-3,Thirteen>I have huntington's.

323
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:50,000
<13-3,Thirteen>不用为我的事大惊小怪
<13-3,Thirteen>No need to get hushed and solemn about it.

324
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,670
<13-4,Masters>为什么要撒谎说你去戒毒了呢
<13-4,Masters>Why are you lying about rehab?

325
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,170
<13-5,Thirteen>因为我不想让别人知道
<13-5,Thirteen>Because the real reason I was gone

326
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:58,020
<13-5,Thirteen>我离开的真正原因
<13-5,Thirteen>is not something I want to share.

327
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,470
<13-6,Masters>你就不能直说吗
<13-6,Masters>Couldn't you just say that?

328
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:02,210
<13-6,Masters>对福曼和其他人来说这理由应该足够了
<13-6,Masters>Should be enough for Foreman and the others.

329
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,870
<13-7,Thirteen>你在这工作多久了
<13-7,Thirteen>How long have you worked here?

330
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,230
<13-7,Thirteen>豪斯手下的这些人
<13-7,Thirteen>House's people have personalities

331
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:06,770
<13-7,Thirteen>都爱管闲事
<13-7,Thirteen>that range from nosy

332
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:09,200
<13-7,Thirteen>在探究你隐私时还振振有词
<13-7,Thirteen>to "pardon me while I do this cavity search".

333
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,870
<13-8,Masters>你觉得处事方法不同的人
<13-8,Masters>Do you think there's room for someone

334
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,250
<13-8,Masters>在他手下会有生存空间吗
<13-8,Masters>who does things differently?

335
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,570
<13-8,Masters>没有
<13-8,Masters>No.

336
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:23,650
<13-9,Thirteen>除非豪斯认为那是他想要的
<13-9,Thirteen>Not unless House decides that's what he wants.

337
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:27,340
<14-1,Foreman>导管移出时
<14-1,Foreman>During catheter removal,

338
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,450
<14-1,Foreman>在大脑中线处得到了很好的图像
<14-1,Foreman>I got a good look at her cerebral midline.

339
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:31,790
<14-1,Foreman>松果体有钙化
<14-1,Foreman>Pineal gland is calcified.

340
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:33,040
<14-2,Thirteen>病例解决了
<14-2,Thirteen>Case closed.

341
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,420
<14-2,Thirteen>我会开始进行激素治疗
<14-2,Thirteen>I'll start her on hormone therapy.

342
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:36,060
<14-2,Thirteen>让她尽快出院
<14-2,Thirteen>Ship her out.

343
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,990
<14-3,Masters>我把记录表交了
<14-3,Masters>I handed in my log.

344
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,780
<14-4,House>你在交表的路上
<14-4,House>On your way to do that,

345
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:46,050
<14-4,House>是不是恰巧帮十三做了腰椎穿刺
<14-4,House>did you happen to stop and give thirteen an LP?

346
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,570
<14-4,House>十三表情僵硬  瞳孔缩小
<14-4,House>Thirteen's stiff gate, small pupils,

347
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,470
<14-4,House>以及她试图隐藏的头痛出卖了你
<14-4,House>and the raging headache she's hiding gave you away.

348
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:55,510
<14-5,Masters>没错  而且我还是违反规定了
<14-5,Masters>Yes. And I still broke a rule.

349
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,060
<14-6,House>我的规定
<14-6,House>My rule.

350
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,380
<14-6,House>是让你藐视权威  而不是我
<14-6,House>Told you to defy the man. Not this man.

351
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:04,270
<14-7,Masters>我不喜欢骗人到底有什么不对
<14-7,Masters>Why is it so wrong that I don't like to cheat?

352
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,120
<14-8,Thirteen>我们可以走了吗
<14-8,Thirteen>Can we go?

353
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,370
<14-8,Thirteen>不行
<14-8,Thirteen>No.

354
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,610
<14-9,House>不喜欢骗人没问题
<14-9,House>Not liking it is fine.

355
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,110
<14-9,House>不喜欢就不做了就是幼稚
<14-9,House>Not doing what you don't like makes you an eight-year-old.

356
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,330
<14-9,House>糟蹋自己的天分
<14-9,House>Wastes your potential.

357
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:13,290
<14-10,Masters>你想让我变得像你一样  这不可能
<14-10,Masters>You want me to be like you. It's not going to happen.

358
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,700
<14-11,House>我根本不想让你变得像我
<14-11,House>That's the last thing I want,

359
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:18,490
<14-11,House>因为这样我们就都不再是独一无二的了
<14-11,House>cause then neither one of us would be exceptional.

360
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,440
<14-12,Masters>你觉得我是独一无二的吗
<14-12,Masters>You think I'm exceptional?

361
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:23,630
<14-13,House>现在不了
<14-13,House>Not anymore.

362
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:27,310
<14-14,Masters>我可以在不妥协的情况下做好我的工作
<14-14,Masters>I can do my job without compromising.

363
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,610
<14-14,Masters>不  你不能
<14-14,Masters>No, you can't,

364
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,320
<14-15,House>因为我不会让你这么做
<14-15,House>cause I'm not gonna let you.

365
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,400
<14-15,House>实习的机会吹了
<14-15,House>Internship's gone.

366
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:37,050
<14-15,House>该和马斯特斯说再见了
<14-15,House>It's time for Masters to say good-bye.

367
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:38,440
<14-15,House>好好当个外科医生吧
<14-15,House>Enjoy being a surgeon.

368
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,840
<14-15,House>你会干得不错的
<14-15,House>You'll be fine.

<17-1,Simpson>Grab a donut and get to work.

384
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,120
<17-2,Resident>没有甜甜圈了
<17-2,Resident>We're out of donuts.

<18-3,Simpson>You got to do better than that. Can't see a thing.

389
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:16,470
<18-4,Masters>推氯化钙
<18-4,Masters>Push calcium chloride.

390
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:19,360
<18-4,Masters>这样会刺激血小板
<18-4,Masters>It will supercharge the platelets

391
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:23,550
<18-4,Masters>加强凝血能力

397
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,010
<19-1,Simpson>一般来说
<19-1,Simpson>Generally speaking,

398
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,290
<19-1,Simpson>实习生是不该说话的
<19-1,Simpson>pledges aren't supposed to talk

399
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,700
<19-1,Simpson>除非他们有问题要问
<19-1,Simpson>unless they ask a question.

400
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:52,910
<19-1,Simpson>这是因为  一般来说
<19-1,Simpson>That's because, generally speaking,

401
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:56,110
<19-1,Simpson>实习生都吐不出什么好话
<19-1,Simpson>pledges don't have anything to say.

402
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:01,120
<19-2,Masters>这个K.P
<19-2,Masters>Um, K.P.

403
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,580
<19-2,Masters>是那个凯德尔·皮尔森吗
<19-2,Masters>Is that patient Kendall Pearson?

404
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,560
<19-2,Masters>我以为她出院了
<19-2,Masters>I thought she was discharged.

405
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:06,950
<19-3,Simpson>那是豪斯的病例
<19-3,Simpson>Mm. It's a House case.

406
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:08,930
<19-3,Simpson>我从来搞不懂他要做什么
<19-3,Simpson>I never know what that guy's up to.

<19-3,Simpson>我想要你参加我的供体肺摘取手术
<19-3,Simpson>I want you to scrub in on my lung harvest.

408
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,590
<19-4,Masters>但这是我第一天实习
<19-4,Masters>But it's my first day.

409
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,300
<19-5,Simpson>我知道  我在场的
<19-5,Simpson>Yes, I know. I was there.

410
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:18,610
<19-5,Simpson>十五分钟内擦洗准备好
<19-5,Simpson>Be scrubbed and ready in 15 minutes.

411
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:45,850
<19-5,Simpson>出什么事了
<19-5,Simpson>What happened?

412
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:47,480
<20-1,Masters>你们不是出院回家了么
<20-1,Masters>Last I heard, you were going home.

413
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:49,590
<20-2,Bobby>凯德尔在停车场晕倒了
<20-2,Bobby>Kendall collapsed in the parking lot.

414
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:54,340
<20-2,Bobby>他们在做什么交感神经切除术
<20-2,Bobby>They're doing something called a "Sympathectomy".

415
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:56,480
<20-3,Masters>她一定是有由肾脏的内脏神经孤独兴奋
<20-3,Masters>She must've had a hypertensive crisis

416
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,240
<20-3,Masters>引起的高血压危象
<20-3,Masters>caused by a neural overstimulation in her kidneys.

417
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,190
<20-3,Masters>所以他们在切除神经
<20-3,Masters>So they're cutting the nerves.

418
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:04,760
<20-3,Masters>就像是切除通往引擎的油管
<20-3,Masters>It's like cutting the gas line to an engine.

419
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,390
<20-4,Bobby>没错  和陶博医生说的差不多
<20-4,Bobby>Yeah, sounds like what Dr. Taub said.

420
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,680
<20-4,Bobby>他说这只是个小手术  但是
<20-4,Bobby>Said it's basic surgery, but...

421
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,720
<20-5,Masters>没错
<20-5,Masters>It is.

422
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:13,970
<20-5,Masters>你们应该还能在三十六小时后启航
<20-5,Masters>You should still be on pace for a launch in 36 hours.

423
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:16,820
<20-6,Bobby>她妈妈正在准备船上的物品呢
<20-6,Bobby>Her mom's packing the boat now.

424
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:19,570
<20-6,Bobby>我本应该去买些干冰的
<20-6,Bobby>I'm supposed to pick up some dry ice.

425
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:21,700
<20-6,Bobby>但是
<20-6,Bobby>But...

426
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:25,730
<20-7,Masters>可留在这里你也帮不上忙啊
<20-7,Masters>Nothing you can do for her here.

427
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,500
<20-8,Boby>我们只是在尽力帮女儿实现梦想
<20-8,Boby>We're just trying to help our daughter reach her dream.

428
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:42,900
<20-9,Masters>她很与众不同
<20-9,Masters>She's different.

429
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:46,690
<20-9,Masters>所以你们也得与众不同才行
<20-9,Masters>So you have to be different.

430
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,770
<20-9,Masters>我会确保她没事的
<20-9,Masters>I'll make sure she's okay.

431
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:55,130
<20-10,Bobby>谢谢
<20-10,Bobby>Thanks.

432
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:04,760
<21-1,Simpson>你可以看到左肺完整的小叶结构
<21-1,Simpson>You can see the full lobular structure of the left lung.

<21-3,Simpson>马斯特斯  拿着这个

<21-5,Nurse Hoffner>You guys okay if I pull a circulating nurse?

<21-5,Nurse Hoffner>第十术间出问题了
<21-5,Nurse Hoffner>We got a train wreck in O.R. Ten.

00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,230
<21-9,Masters>我得去厕所
<21-9,Masters>I have to use the bathroom.

444
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,830
<21-10,Resident>我知道你是新手  但你也太离谱了
<21-10,Resident>I know you're a rookie, but you got to be kidding.

445
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:29,200
<21-12,Simpson>-我真忍不住了  -等会再说
<21-12,Simpson>- I'm not. - It can wait.

446
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:31,250
<21-13,Masters>我快忍不住了
<21-13,Masters>I'm gonna have an accident.

447
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:34,630
<21-14,Simpson>队里的下一位  拿好
<21-14,Simpson>Next one in line, grab it.

00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:47,910
<22-3,House>你不是自己有手术吗
<22-3,House>Don't you have your own surgery?

452
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:52,380
<22-4,Masters>我溜出来了  我告诉他们我要去厕所
<22-4,Masters>I took a break. I told them I had to pee.

453
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:54,010
<22-4,Masters>你撒谎了
<22-4,Masters>You lied.

454
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:56,740
<22-5,House>一个小谎  但你上道了
<22-5,House>Small one. But it's a gateway lie.

455
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,490
<22-6,Masters>我关心这位病人
<22-6,Masters>I care about the patient.

456
00:21:58,610 --> 00:21:59,630
<22-7,House>又撒了一个谎
<22-7,House>Another lie.

457
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,110
<22-7,House>你在乎的是自己是否独一无二
<22-7,House>You care about being exceptional.

458
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:03,110
<22-8,Masters>我和她父亲说过我会照顾好她的
<22-8,Masters>I told her dad I was gonna take care of her.

459
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,540
<22-9,House>第三个谎言
<22-9,House>A third lie.

460
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:06,980
<22-9,House>你真是越来越上道了
<22-9,House>Welcome to the slippery slope.

461
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,100
<22-10,Taub>右房压八毫米汞柱

<22-10,Taub>Equalization of pressures.

463
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,890
<22-11,Foreman>就是说她患了缩窄性心包炎
<22-11,Foreman>Means she has restrictive pericarditis.

464
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:13,850
<22-12,Chase>外加钙化的松果体
<22-12,Chase>Add that to a calcified pineal gland.

465
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:16,090
<22-13,House>什么情况下钙化的松果体
<22-13,House>When is a calcified pineal gland

466
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:18,870
<22-13,House>不是真正的钙化的松果体
<22-13,House>not a calcified pineal gland?

467
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:20,800
<22-13,House>我知道理论上不可能  但
<22-13,House>I realize, technically, it's never, but--

468
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:21,890
<22-14,Thirteen>是肉芽肿的时候
<22-14,Thirteen>When it's a granuloma.

469
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:22,890
<22-14,Thirteen>是韦格纳氏肉芽肿
<22-14,Thirteen>It's Wegener's.

470
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:23,480
<22-14,Thirteen>得给她用类固醇治疗
<22-14,Thirteen>We should start her on steroids.

471
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:24,620
<22-15,Masters>但是她肌酸激酶很高
<22-15,Masters>But she had a high CK.

472
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:25,760
<22-15,Masters>韦格纳氏肉芽肿解释不了
<22-15,Masters>Wegener's wouldn't explain the--

473
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:27,580
<22-16,Taub>脱水解释的通
<22-16,Taub>Dehydration does.

474
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,310
<22-17,Masters>是的  但是钙化的松果体
<22-17,Masters>Yes. But the calcified pineal

475
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:31,960
<22-17,Masters>可能是结节病
<22-17,Masters>could be sarcoidosis.

476
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:36,010
<22-18,House>你撒谎说要上厕所  就得我倾心了
<22-18,House>You had me at "I had to pee".

477
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:36,970
<22-18,House>但是十三是对的
<22-18,House>But Thirteen's right.

478
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:39,360
<22-18,House>给她用三倍剂量的免疫抑制剂
<22-18,House>Start her on three fold immunosuppressants.

479
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:40,970
<22-18,House>马斯特斯  如果想和我争论此事的话
<22-18,House>Masters, if you want to fight me on this,

480
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,360
<22-18,House>填个会诊表格你就能留下跟进这病例了
<22-18,House>fill out a consult form so you can stick around.

481
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,330
<22-18,House>欢迎回归
<22-18,House>Welcome back.

482
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:47,530
<22-19,Masters>我没有要回来
<22-19,Masters>I'm not back!

483
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:51,770
<22-19,Masters>我只待到这个病例结束
<22-19,Masters>I'll just be staying for this case.

484
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:58,430
<22-20,House>你还真是个大师级谎话精啊
<22-20,House>You got really good at this lying thing.

485
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:09,500
<23-1,Simpson>希望这只是智者的一次失误
<23-1,Simpson>Hope it was one hell of a whiz.

486
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,100
<23-2,Masters>我碰到了豪斯医生
<23-2,Masters>I ran into Dr. House.

487
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:14,570
<23-2,Masters>他要求我为他的病人做外科会诊
<23-2,Masters>He requested a surgical consult for his patient.

488
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:17,970
<23-3,Simpson>豪斯从来不会要求会诊
<23-3,Simpson>House never asks for a consult.

489
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:19,310
<23-4,Masters>关于这个病例
<23-4,Masters>Something about this case,

490
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:21,130
<23-4,Masters>他需要额外的帮助
<23-4,Masters>he needed a little more help.

491
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:23,010
<23-5,Simpson>你外科实习的第一天
<23-5,Simpson>First day of your surgical internship,

492
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:25,760
<23-5,Simpson>你就想被外借到其他部门去
<23-5,Simpson>you want to be loaned out to another department.

493
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:27,950
<23-5,Simpson>有趣的职业举动啊
<23-5,Simpson>Interesting career move.

494
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:30,200
<23-5,Simpson>把表格放到我办公室
<23-5,Simpson>Drop the form by my office.

495
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,680
<23-5,Simpson>不要去太久
<23-5,Simpson>Don't stay away too long.

496
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:34,590
<23-5,Simpson>我已经开始渐渐忘记你了
<23-5,Simpson>I'm already well on my way to forgetting you.

497
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:44,550
<24-1,Cruz>我请你们两位美女去喝一杯怎么样
<24-1,Cruz>How about I take both you lovely ladies out for a drink?

498
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:47,070
<24-2,Donovan>我想去来着  但我觉得你是个白痴
<24-2,Donovan>I'd love to. Except I think you're a cretin.

499
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:50,140
<24-2,Donovan>她最后一次搭着横杠是在芭蕾课上
<24-2,Donovan>And the last time she was at a bar was ballet class.

501
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:52,090
<24-3,Masters>我没上过
<24-3,Masters>I didn't take--

502
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:54,290
<24-3,Masters>很好笑
<24-3,Masters>Oh. That's funny.

503
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:57,340
<24-3,Masters>我要留在这里给豪斯的病人做些化验
<24-3,Masters>I'm gonna stay and run a few extra tests on House's patient.

504
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,950
<24-3,Masters>我觉得有一个实验数据不太对
<24-3,Masters>This one lab value doesn't make sense to me.

505
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:01,390
<24-4,Donovan>你要回豪斯那里吗
<24-4,Donovan>You're back with House?

506
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:04,470
<24-5,Masters>就这个病例  我不会久留的
<24-5,Masters>Mm. Just this one case. I'm not staying.

507
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,570
<24-6,Cruz>要能和他共事叫我杀人都愿意
<24-6,Cruz>I would kill for a chance to work with him.

508
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:10,040
<24-6,Cruz>比如剥了你的皮再穿上你的皮囊伪装成你
<24-6,Cruz>Like, literally skin you and wear you as a disguise.

509
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:48,730
<25-2,House>你的鸡肉是要劲脆的还是原味的
<25-2,House>You want yours extra crispy or original recipe?

510
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:10,530
<25-3,Masters>鸡
<25-3,Masters>Chickens!

511
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:16,000
<25-3,Masters>你因家禽得过病吗
<25-3,Masters>You ever get sick from poultry?

512
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:18,280
<26-1,Masters>几个月前
<26-1,Masters>Um, a few months ago

513
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:21,520
<26-2,Kendall>因为一罐鸡肉罐头  我爸还嘲笑我
<26-2,Kendall>from this pheasant-in-a-can my dad got me as a joke.

514
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:22,760
<26-2,Kendall>你觉得那是我生病的原因吗
<26-2,Kendall>You think that's why I'm sick?

515
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:24,120
<26-3,Masters>我觉得那个罐子里充满了
<26-3,Masters>I think that can was chock-full

516
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:28,140
<26-3,Masters>沙门氏菌的病菌
<26-3,Masters>of a bacteria called salmonella enteritis,

517
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,260
<26-3,Masters>喜欢驻留在骨头上
<26-3,Masters>likes to hang out in the bones.

518
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:32,420
<26-3,Masters>感觉紧张或疼痛时告诉我
<26-3,Masters>Let me know if any of this is tender or painful.

519
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,410
<26-4,Kendall>这个细菌什么的
<26-4,Kendall>Um, this bacteria thing,

520
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:36,290
<26-4,Kendall>是好消息还是坏消息
<26-4,Kendall>is this good news or bad?

521
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:38,540
<26-5,Masters>如果我说的没错
<26-5,Masters>Well, if I'm right,

522
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,660
<26-5,Masters>那么你只需要服用抗生素就可以了
<26-5,Masters>that means all you'll need are antibiotics.

523
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:44,410
<26-5,Masters>你就能恢复"船形"[井然有序  意指恢复健康]
<26-5,Masters>And you'll be, uh, well, shipshape.

524
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:47,610
<26-5,Masters>抱歉  没忍住
<26-5,Masters>Sorry. Couldn't resist.

525
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:53,490
<26-5,Masters>你一直都认为航海是你真正想做的事吗
<26-5,Masters>Did you always know that sailing was it for you?

526
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,660
<26-5,Masters>是适合自己的吗
<26-5,Masters>That it was the right thing?

527
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:57,660
<26-6,Kendall>我直到十岁才开始航海
<26-6,Kendall>Didn't even start till I was ten.

528
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:00,650
<26-6,Kendall>开始时  我并不热衷于此
<26-6,Kendall>And at first, I was not a fan.

529
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:03,480
<26-6,Kendall>很明显航海有许多惹人厌的地方
<26-6,Kendall>Certainly there's plenty not to like about sailing.

530
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:05,020
<26-7,Masters>但你现在却如此痴迷
<26-7,Masters>But now that you're so into it...

531
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:08,240
<26-8,Kendall>不  仍然有很多关于航海的事是我讨厌的
<26-8,Kendall>Oh, no, there's still plenty of things I hate about it.

532
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,950
<26-8,Kendall>我讨厌弄湿自己  讨厌寒冷
<26-8,Kendall>I hate being wet. I hate being cold.

533
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,270
<26-8,Kendall>我讨厌什么都没得吃只能吃冻干的食物
<26-8,Kendall>I hate eating nothing but freeze-dried food.

534
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,470
<26-9,Masters>举双脚表赞同
<26-9,Masters>That is quite the endorsement.

535
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:16,780
<26-10,Kendall>航海很棒
<26-10,Kendall>Sailing is amazing.

536
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:20,200
<26-10,Kendall>但并不是说我喜欢待在船上的分分秒秒
<26-10,Kendall>But doesn't mean I love every second on the boat.

537
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:24,130
<26-10,Kendall>做自己之所爱即是要处理自己之所不爱
<26-10,Kendall>Doing what you love means dealing with things you don't.

538
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:25,840
<26-10,Kendall>如果没有要克服的困难
<26-10,Kendall>If there were nothing to overcome,

539
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,870
<26-10,Kendall>可能就没有那么
<26-10,Kendall>it might not be that--

540
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:36,090
<27-1,Chase>沙门氏菌这个诊断不错啊
<27-1,Chase>Salmonella enteritis is a nice catch.

541
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:39,980
<27-2,Masters>谢谢  开始看软组织窗
<27-2,Masters>Thanks. Starting on the soft tissue windows.

542
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:43,030
<27-3,Chase>这病例结束  你就回外科吗
<27-3,Chase>Once this case is over, you going back to surgery?

543
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:45,700
<27-4,Masters>是这么打算的
<27-4,Masters>That's the plan.

544
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,910
<27-5,Chase>我觉得你这样做是在犯错
<27-5,Chase>I think that's a mistake.

545
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,180
<27-5,Chase>我觉得你应该回外科
<27-5,Chase>I think you should go back to surgery.

546
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:53,950
<27-6,Masters>我刚就是这么说的
<27-6,Masters>I just said I was.

547
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:56,450
<27-7,Chase>不对  你说那是你的打算
<27-7,Chase>No. You said it was your plan.

548
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:58,410
<27-7,Chase>也就是说豪斯可能是对的
<27-7,Chase>Which means House might be right.

549
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:02,090
<27-7,Chase>你可能是在欺骗自己
<27-7,Chase>And you might be lying to yourself.

550
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,290
<27-8,Masters>有那么可怕吗
<27-8,Masters>Would it be so terrible?

551
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:06,400
<27-8,Masters>你选择了跟豪斯而不是去外科
<27-8,Masters>You chose House over surgery.

552
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,720
<27-9,Chase>在这里的经历改变了我
<27-9,Chase>My time here changed me

553
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:11,520
<27-9,Chase>我身边的人并不都认为这是种好的转变
<27-9,Chase>in ways not everyone in my life thought was for the better.

554
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:14,820
<27-9,Chase>没有肿块  接下来看骨窗
<27-9,Chase>No masses. Moving on to bone windows.

555
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:21,880
<27-10,Masters>那些人说的对吗
<27-10,Masters>Are those people right?

556
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,930
<27-11,Chase>我觉得你一旦变了
<27-11,Chase>I think when you do change,

557
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,700
<27-11,Chase>想再回到过去就不那么简单了
<27-11,Chase>it's not so simple to go back.

558
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:30,790
<27-11,Chase>那里
<27-11,Chase>There.

559
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:34,920
<27-11,Chase>肱骨那边
<27-11,Chase>In the humerus.

560
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,510
<27-12,Masters>看着不像是感染
<27-12,Masters>Doesn't look like an infection.

561
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,010
<27-13,Chase>因为看着像肿瘤
<27-13,Chase>That's because it looks like cancer.

562
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:53,650
<28-1,Masters>你得了淋巴肉瘤
<28-1,Masters>You have lymphoid sarcoma.

563
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:57,480
<28-1,Masters>这癌症位于你手臂骨头上
<28-1,Masters>A cancer in the bone in your arm.

564
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:02,170
<28-2,Kendall>我会好起来吗
<28-2,Kendall>Am I going to be okay?

565
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:03,830
<28-3,Masters>这种癌症是可治愈的
<28-3,Masters>It's a treatable cancer.

566
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:08,220
<28-3,Masters>但治疗包括截去你的手臂
<28-3,Masters>But part of that treatment involves amputating your arm.

567
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:10,060
<28-3,Masters>我很抱歉
<28-3,Masters>I'm sorry.

568
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:12,570
<28-4,Kendall>没有其它的了吗
<28-4,Kendall>There's nothing else?

569
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:17,170
<28-5,Masters>截肢后需做化疗和放疗
<28-5,Masters>We can do chemo and radiation after the amputation.

570
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:20,160
<28-6,Kendall>不是说后续其它  我是说其它选择
<28-6,Kendall>I don't mean after. I mean instead of.

571
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:22,670
<28-6,Kendall>如果我赶快出院  我还有时间去破纪录
<28-6,Kendall>If I leave soon, I still have time to break the record.

572
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:25,140
<28-7,Bobby>宝贝  你不是说真的吧
<28-7,Bobby>Honey, you can't be serious.

573
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,380
<28-8,Kendall>我感觉没事啊
<28-8,Kendall>I feel fine.

574
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,000
<28-8,Kendall>昨晚  他们还以为是感染呢
<28-8,Kendall>Last night, they thought it was an infection.

575
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,810
<28-9,Masters>确诊是癌症
<28-9,Masters>We know it's cancer.

576
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:31,460
<28-9,Masters>活检了三次
<28-9,Masters>We ran the biopsy three times.

577
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,170
<28-10,Kendall>你不知道多快
<28-10,Kendall>You don't know how fast--

578
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,000
<28-11,Masters>延迟手术
<28-11,Masters>Postponing the surgery

579
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,640
<28-11,Masters>会提高癌细胞扩散的风险
<28-11,Masters>could increase the likelihood that the cancer will spread.

580
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:38,350
<28-12,Paige>凯德尔  你需要考虑考虑医生说的
<28-12,Paige>Kendall, you need to think about what the doctor's saying.

581
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,520
<28-13,Kendall>你考虑的是帆船航海
<28-13,Kendall>I'm thinking about the sail.

582
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:41,940
<28-13,Kendall>我十岁起就这样
<28-13,Kendall>Like I have since I was ten.

583
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,850
<28-13,Kendall>别把它夺走
<28-13,Kendall>Don't take this away from me.

584
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,190
<28-13,Kendall>就一个月
<28-13,Kendall>It's just a month.

585
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:46,780
<28-13,Kendall>我会特别小心
<28-13,Kendall>I can take extra precautions.

586
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:48,080
<28-13,Kendall>我会每天和你们网络通话
<28-13,Kendall>I'll skype you every day

587
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,440
<28-13,Kendall>要有状况我可以飞回来
<28-13,Kendall>and I can fly back if something goes wrong.

588
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,540
<28-14,Masters>她在拿生命冒险
<28-14,Masters>She'll be risking her life.

589
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:56,460
<28-15,Paige>我们一家想私下谈谈
<28-15,Paige>I think we need to discuss this as a family.

590
00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:00,830
<28-15,Paige>你在考虑她说的话吗
<28-15,Paige>You're considering this?

591
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,880
<28-16,Masters>你女儿的情况
<28-16,Masters>Your daughter's condition--

592
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,020
<28-17,Paige>谢谢你  马斯特斯医生
<28-17,Paige>Thank you, Dr. Masters.

593
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:37,980
<29-1,Bobby>她心意已决  想明天就起航
<29-1,Bobby>She's not budging. She wants to launch tomorrow.

594
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,010
<29-2,Masters>她是未成年人
<29-2,Masters>She's a minor.

595
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,620
<29-2,Masters>只要监护人签了同意书  我们就能手术
<29-2,Masters>You sign the consent form, we can do the surgery.

596
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,590
<29-2,Masters>截肢会是
<29-2,Masters>Amputation can be an emo--

597
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:48,680
<29-3,Bobby>她说服了她母亲
<29-3,Bobby>She's talked my wife into agreeing with her.

598
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:53,020
<29-4,Masters>一名家长签字就行
<29-4,Masters>One parent's signature is enough.

599
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,300
<29-4,Masters>她需要你尽父亲之职
<29-4,Masters>She needs you to be a parent.

600
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:01,800
<29-5,Bobby>你是在让我拆散我的家庭
<29-5,Bobby>You're asking me to blow up my family.

601
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:06,490
<29-6,Masters>我是在让你挽救你的家庭
<29-6,Masters>I'm asking you to save your family.

602
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,110
<29-7,Bobby>她第一次独自横穿大西洋时
<29-7,Bobby>On her first solo atlantic crossing,

603
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:11,000
<29-7,Bobby>就和我们闹上法庭
<29-7,Bobby>she scheduled a court date

604
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,060
<29-7,Bobby>要脱离父母监护
<29-7,Bobby>to become an emancipated minor.

605
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:19,380
<29-7,Bobby>她会再来一次  并且还会成功
<29-7,Bobby>She'll do it again and she'll win.

606
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:25,630
<29-7,Bobby>我同不同意她依旧会去做
<29-7,Bobby>She is gonna do what she's gonna do with or without me.

607
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:29,110
<29-7,Bobby>我宁愿当个支持她的父亲
<29-7,Bobby>I'd rather have it be with.

608
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,690
<29-8,Masters>我没辙了
<29-8,Masters>I'm stuck.

609
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:49,850
<29-9,House>不  你没有
<29-9,House>No, you're not.

610
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:53,660
<29-9,House>病例解决了  回外科实习去吧
<29-9,House>Case is over. You're back to surgery.

611
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:57,000
<29-9,House>衔回来
<29-9,House>And fetch.

612
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,210
<29-9,House>好孩子
<29-9,House>Oh, that's a good boy.

613
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:01,210
<29-9,House>好孩子
<29-9,House>Oh, that's a good boy.

614
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:04,080
<29-9,House>好孩子
<29-9,House>Hey, good boy.

615
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:06,350
<29-10,Masters>没人去阻止凯德尔航海
<29-10,Masters>No one will stop Kendall's sail.

616
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:07,540
<29-10,Masters>你得介入了
<29-10,Masters>You need to step in.

617
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:10,100
<29-11,House>门上写着我是诊断医师
<29-11,House>Sign on the door says I'm a diagnostician.

618
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,860
<29-11,House>诊断出来就没我的事了
<29-11,House>Cool diagnosis means I'm finished.

619
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,040
<29-12,Masters>她会死的
<29-12,Masters>She could die.

620
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:15,990
<29-13,House>我很确信法律规定
<29-13,House>Pretty sure the law of the land states

621
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:18,530
<29-13,House>每个人都有权当傻瓜
<29-13,House>that everyone has the right to be an idiot.

622
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:20,540
<29-13,House>应该是宪法第二修正案  衔回来
<29-13,House>I think it's the second amendment. Fetch!

623
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:24,460
<29-13,House>衔过来  孩子
<29-13,House>Bring it here, boy.

624
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:26,660
<29-13,House>谁是好孩子
<29-13,House>Who's a good boy?

625
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:29,260
<29-14,Masters>你一直对虚伪嗤之以鼻
<29-14,Masters>You are constantly railing against hypocrisy,

626
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:32,200
<29-14,Masters>逼别人去面对现实
<29-14,Masters>forcing people to face the truth.

627
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:34,010
<29-14,Masters>这次却坐视不理吗
<29-14,Masters>This time nothing?

628
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,450
<29-15,House>对  因为他们已经面对现实了
<29-15,House>Yeah. 'Cause they faced the truth.

629
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,410
<29-16,Masters>并做了一个
<29-16,Masters>And made a decision

630
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:41,890
<29-16,Masters>极可能害死自己女儿的决定
<29-16,Masters>that will in all likelihood kill their daughter.

631
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:44,210
<29-16,Masters>我无所谓
<29-16,Masters>I'm fine with that.

632
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:46,780
<29-17,House>我想要诊断结果  有了
<29-17,House>I wanted a diagnosis. I got it.

633
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:48,700
<29-17,House>你想要什么
<29-17,House>What do you want?

634
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:51,970
<29-18,Masters>我不想她死
<29-18,Masters>I don't want her to die.

635
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:55,000
<29-19,House>那就违规行事呗
<29-19,House>Break the rules.

636
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:59,250
<29-20,Masters>我不能
<29-20,Masters>I can't.

637
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:02,040
<29-21,House>看样子对你来说
<29-21,House>So coloring inside the lines is more important to you

638
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:05,880
<29-21,House>墨守成规比救这女孩更重要
<29-21,House>than saving this girl's life?

639
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:08,160
<29-21,House>我弄错了一件事
<29-21,House>I was wrong about one thing,

640
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:11,030
<29-21,House>你不过是个常人
<29-21,House>you are not exceptional.

641
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,880
<29-21,House>衔回来
<29-21,House>And fetch!

642
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:16,220
<29-21,House>好孩子
<29-21,House>Ho ho ho. Oh, that's a good boy.

643
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:19,000
<29-21,House>好孩子  好孩子
<29-21,House>Good boy. Good boy.

644
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:24,480
<30-1,Masters>威尔森医生
<30-1,Masters>Dr. Wilson.

645
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:25,950
<30-1,Masters>关于一名癌症病人的事
<30-1,Masters>Um, I'd like to get your advice

646
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,800
<30-1,Masters>我想听听你意见
<30-1,Masters>about a cancer patient.

647
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:30,560
<30-2,Wilson>凯德尔·皮尔森  肿瘤科查过房
<30-2,Wilson>Kendall Pearson. Oncology rounds.

648
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:32,840
<30-2,Wilson>大家都在谈论
<30-2,Wilson>Everyone's talking about it.

649
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:34,300
<30-3,Masters>你还好吗
<30-3,Masters>Are you okay?

650
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:37,400
<30-4,Wilson>没事  我背有点不舒服
<30-4,Wilson>Yeah, my back's acting up.

651
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:43,270
<30-5,Masters>换你会怎么做呢
<30-5,Masters>So what would you do?

652
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:46,380
<30-6,Wilson>我会继续劝说她手术
<30-6,Wilson>I would keep trying to convince her to have the surgery.

653
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,870
<30-7,Masters>要是她还是拒绝呢
<30-7,Masters>And if she kept saying no?

654
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,320
<30-8,Wilson>我会继续
<30-8,Wilson>I would just keep--

655
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:54,570
<30-8,Wilson>继续  尝试
<30-8,Wilson>keep--keep trying.

656
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:56,730
<30-9,Masters>我知道下面有只鸡
<30-9,Masters>I know there's a chicken under there.

657
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:58,550
<30-10,Wilson>谢天谢地
<30-10,Wilson>Oh, thank god.

658
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:01,710
<30-10,Wilson>它都啄坏我一双鞋了
<30-10,Wilson>It's pecked through one pair of my loafers.

659
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:11,040
<30-11,Masters>所以你就只是劝说吗
<30-11,Masters>So that's all you'd do?

660
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:13,990
<30-12,Wilson>你只能劝说
<30-12,Wilson>That's all you can do.

661
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:16,080
<30-13,Masters>是吗
<30-13,Masters>Is it?

662
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:27,440
<30-13,Masters>这不是豪斯的那只鸡吗
<30-13,Masters>Isn't that House's chicken?

663
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:28,740
<30-14,Wilson>恶心的畜生
<30-14,Wilson>Disgusting beasts.

664
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:30,400
<30-14,Wilson>搞不懂自己为什么同意打这赌
<30-14,Wilson>I don't know why I ever agreed to this bet.

665
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,400
<30-15,Masters>那就退出呗
<30-15,Masters>So call it off.

666
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:34,800
<30-16,Wilson>并输掉二十美元吗
<30-16,Wilson>And lose $20?

667
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:39,010
<30-16,Wilson>豪斯当年也处于凯德尔一样的处境
<30-16,Wilson>Listen, House was in the exact same situation Kendall's in.

668
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:41,140
<30-16,Wilson>他得做手术  但他不想做
<30-16,Wilson>He needed surgery, but he didn't want it.

669
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:42,610
<30-16,Wilson>他陷入诱导昏迷后
<30-16,Wilson>Once he was in medically-induced coma,

670
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:45,780
<30-16,Wilson>他女友代其签了同意书
<30-16,Wilson>his girlfriend signed the consent form as his proxy.

671
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:48,740
<30-16,Wilson>医院违背他的意愿做了手术
<30-16,Wilson>They went ahead with the surgery against his will.

672
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:51,740
<30-16,Wilson>虽说算是救了他的命
<30-16,Wilson>Probably saved his life.

673
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:54,280
<30-17,Masters>所以她做得对
<30-17,Masters>So she did the right thing?

674
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:57,100
<30-18,Wilson>答案取决于你问谁
<30-18,Wilson>Depends on who you ask.

675
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,170
<30-19,House>衔回来
<30-19,House>Fetch!

676
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:03,970
<30-20,Wilson>不  不
<30-20,Wilson>No! No!

677
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,140
<31-1,Guard>请问
<31-1,Guard>Excuse me.

678
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:16,070
<31-1,Guard>这只鸡是哪位的
<31-1,Guard>Who's responsible for this chicken?

679
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:19,740
<31-1,Guard>谁知道这只鸡是谁的
<31-1,Guard>Does anyone know who owns the chicken?

680
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:22,190
<31-2,Wilson>这只鸟类
<31-2,Wilson>That bird belongs to...

681
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,050
<31-2,Wilson>是格利高里·豪斯医生的
<31-2,Wilson>Dr. Gregory House.

682
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:05,600
<32-1,Masters>你需要做这手术
<32-1,Masters>You need to do this surgery.

683
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:06,350
<32-2,Kendall>我会做的
<32-2,Kendall>I will.

684
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,050
<32-3,Masters>现在就做
<32-3,Masters>Now.

685
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:09,160
<32-4,Kendall>这事我们已经讨论过了
<32-4,Kendall>We've been through this.

686
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,500
<32-4,Kendall>我今天就出院
<32-4,Kendall>I'm leaving today.

687
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:12,580
<32-5,Masters>不过是项纪录而已
<32-5,Masters>It's a stupid record.

688
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:16,010
<32-6,Kendall>不是纪录的问题
<32-6,Kendall>It's not about the record.

689
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:19,000
<32-6,Kendall>我以前和人竞赛的时候
<32-6,Kendall>I used to race against other people.

690
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,490
<32-6,Kendall>驾最慢的船也能得第一
<32-6,Kendall>I could have the slowest boat in the fleet and I'd win.

691
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:23,980
<32-7,Masters>那么你是为了证明自己比别人优秀吗
<32-7,Masters>So it's about being better than everyone else?

692
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:28,200
<32-8,Kendall>这与其他任何人无关  只是我自己
<32-8,Kendall>It has nothing to do with anybody except me.

693
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:31,330
<32-8,Kendall>其他帆船手都觉得我是疯子
<32-8,Kendall>The other racers would think I was crazy.

694
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,350
<32-8,Kendall>我会把帆转到匪夷所思的角度出航
<32-8,Kendall>I'd set off on some tacking angle

695
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:34,680
<32-8,Kendall>他们完全不能理解
<32-8,Kendall>that made no sense to them

696
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:39,530
<32-8,Kendall>因为他们无法了解我的感觉
<32-8,Kendall>because they couldn't see what I saw.

697
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:41,050
<32-8,Kendall>我能在风向改变之前
<32-8,Kendall>I could sense the changes in the wind

698
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:45,300
<32-8,Kendall>就察觉到变化
<32-8,Kendall>before they even happened.

699
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:51,140
<32-8,Kendall>当你站到顶峰  游戏规则就不同了
<32-8,Kendall>At the top of the game, you play by different rules.

700
00:36:57,210 --> 00:37:00,960
<32-9,Masters>这药会有点刺激血管
<32-9,Masters>Medicine's gonna burn a little bit.

701
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:23,170
<33-1,Foreman>心动过缓  三度房室传导阻滞
<33-1,Foreman>Bradycardic arrest. Third degree heart block.

702
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,520
<33-2,Chase>很可能是伴癌综合征
<33-2,Chase>Likely paraneoplastic syndrome.

703
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,520
<33-3,Foreman>得把她送到手术室
<33-3,Foreman>We need to get her to the O.R.

704
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:28,260
<33-3,Foreman>做心律调整或者血浆置换
<33-3,Foreman>for pacemaker or plasmapheresis.

705
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:33,670
<33-4,Paige>怎么回事
<33-4,Paige>What's going on?

706
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:35,990
<33-5,Masters>癌症导致她心跳变缓
<33-5,Masters>The cancer is causing her heart to slow down.

707
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:38,420
<33-5,Masters>我们需要把她送到手术室治疗
<33-5,Masters>We have to get her to the O.R. and treat her.

708
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,210
<33-5,Masters>这种情况正是我担心的
<33-5,Masters>This is what I was worried about.

709
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:42,480
<33-5,Masters>如果航行中发生这种事  她会丧命
<33-5,Masters>If this had happened at sea, she would be dead.

710
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:44,930
<33-6,Paige>我的上帝
<33-6,Paige>Oh, my god.

711
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:47,130
<33-7,Masters>我们需要你们签了同意书
<33-7,Masters>We need you to sign the consent form.

712
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:50,710
<33-7,Masters>授权我们截断她的手臂
<33-7,Masters>Authorize us to amputate her arm.

713
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,590
<34-1,Chase>锁骨下静脉通路建立
<34-1,Chase>Subclavian access established.

714
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:13,540
<34-2,Taub>-临时起搏器就位  -没有必要
<34-2,Taub>- Temporary pacer ready. - Don't need it.

715
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:14,790
<34-2,Taub>注射氯化钙
<34-2,Taub>Push calcium chloride.

716
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:17,300
<34-3,Masters>房室传导阻滞就会好转
<34-3,Masters>It'll fix the heart block.

717
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:21,080
<34-3,Masters>心动过缓是我引发的
<34-3,Masters>Bradycardia was me.

718
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,480
<34-4,Thirteen>是你干的
<34-4,Thirteen>You did this?

719
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:27,320
<34-5,Masters>她父母签了同意书
<34-5,Masters>Parents signed the consent form.

720
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,290
<34-5,Masters>做截肢
<34-5,Masters>Amputate her arm.

721
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:51,330
<35-1,Kendall>发生什么事了
<35-1,Kendall>What happened?

722
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:54,560
<35-2,Masters>你心脏病发作
<35-2,Masters>You had a cardiac episode

723
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,650
<35-2,Masters>我们不得不进行手术
<35-2,Masters>that required us to bring you into the O.R.

724
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:59,180
<35-2,Masters>现在危机已经解除  但是
<35-2,Masters>That crisis resolved, but...

725
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,100
<35-3,Kendall>你们做了什么  你们做了什么
<35-3,Kendall>What did you do? What did you do?

726
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:02,920
<35-4,Masters>手术过程中
<35-4,Masters>During surgery,

727

<35-4,Masters>我们在你颈部淋巴结发现癌细胞
<35-4,Masters>we found cancer in a lymph node in your neck.

728
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:06,330
<35-5,Kendall>所以你们砍掉了我的胳膊
<35-5,Kendall>So you cut off my arm?

729
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:07,440
<35-6,Masters>癌症已经开始扩散
<35-6,Masters>Cancer was already spreading.

730
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:09,180
<35-6,Masters>只能如此
<35-6,Masters>It had to be done.

731
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:10,880
<35-7,Kendall>我说了我不想这样
<35-7,Kendall>I told you I didn't want this.

732
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:13,520
<35-8,Masters>如果等到航行结束再手术
<35-8,Masters>If we had waited until after the sail was over

733
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:16,150
<35-8,Masters>就为时已晚了
<35-8,Masters>you would have died.

734
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:19,260
<35-9,Kendall>那项记录就是我的一切
<35-9,Kendall>That record. That was everything.

735
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,500
<35-10,Bobby>它不是你的一切
<35-10,Bobby>It wasn't everything.

736
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:22,830
<35-10,Bobby>你还有生活  有未来
<35-10,Bobby>You have a life. A future.

737
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,520
<35-11,Kendall>都说好了的  你们怎么可以这样
<35-11,Kendall>You weren't supposed to do this. How could you?

738
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:28,610
<35-12,Paige>因为我们爱你

<35-13,Kendall>我恨你们

00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:33,090
<35-13,Kendall>我恨你们两个
<35-13,Kendall>I hate both of you.

741
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:39,410
<35-14,Bobby>好了
<35-14,Bobby>Okay.

742
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:45,390
<35-15,Kendall>我的胳膊

743
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:02,570
<35-15,Kendall>我的胳膊

00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:08,360
<35-16,Paige>马斯特斯医生  谢谢你
<35-16,Paige>Dr. Masters, thank you.

745
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:42,910
<36-1,House>某人撅着嘴闷闷不乐呀
<36-1,House>Someone has got their pouty face on.

746
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:46,100
<36-2,Masters>我做了任何头脑清醒的医生都不会做的事
<36-2,Masters>I did things no doctor in their right mind would do.

747
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:48,050
<36-3,House>很好
<36-3,House>Good.

748
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,480
<36-4,Masters>我操纵  说谎  伪造  偷窃
<36-4,Masters>I manipulated, lied, forged, stole.

749
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,870
<36-5,House>我不想知道细节
<36-5,House>I don't want to know the specifics.

750
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:54,800
<36-5,House>万一被传讯就不好了
<36-5,House>Might be called to testify.

751
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:02,170
<36-6,Masters>我当时相信自己是对的所以才打破规则
<36-6,Masters>I broke the rules because I believed I was right.

752
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,280
<36-7,House>你是对的
<36-7,House>You were right.

753
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:05,340
<36-8,Masters>那我为什么没有感到舒心如意
<36-8,Masters>Then why don't I feel good or satisfied?

754
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:07,450
<36-8,Masters>反而恶心想吐
<36-8,Masters>Instead, I just feel like throwing up.

755
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:10,070
<36-9,House>所以你跟着我是想问时常打破规则的我
<36-9,House>And you're following me to ask how I break the rules

756
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,180
<36-9,House>为何依旧风度翩翩
<36-9,House>and maintain my rosy demeanor.

757
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:13,740
<36-10,Masters>我不是为了自己高兴才那样做
<36-10,Masters>I didn't do it to be happy.

758
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:17,850
<36-10,Masters>我只是以为我会好过
<36-10,Masters>I just thought I would be.

759
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:21,710
<36-11,House>人生岂能事事如意
<36-11,House>You can't always get what you want.

00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:16,320
<36-17,Masters>我无所谓
<36-17,Masters>I'm fine with that.
