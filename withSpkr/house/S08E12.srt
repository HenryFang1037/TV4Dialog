1
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:10,640
<1-1,Cindy>你的纱布在渗血
<1-1,Cindy>You're bleeding through your bandage.

2
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:18,070
<1-2,Chase>早啊
<1-2,Chase>Good morning.

3
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:20,000
<1-3,Cindy>不用去找医生吗
<1-3,Cindy>Don't we need to get you to a doctor?

4
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:22,160
<1-4,Chase>我就是医生
<1-4,Chase>I am a doctor.

5
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,150
<1-4,Chase>昨晚我没提吗
<1-4,Chase>That didn't come up last night?

6
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,640
<1-5,Cindy>我们聊的不多
<1-5,Cindy>We didn't do a lot of talking.

7
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,950
<1-6,Chase>我没事
<1-6,Chase>I'm good.

8
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,840
<1-7,Cindy>你没说过你是如何受伤的
<1-7,Cindy>You never told me what caused your accident.

9
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:02,110
<1-8,Chase>我被个病人捅了
<1-8,Chase>I was stabbed by a patient.

10
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,630
<1-8,Chase>以后收医药费绝不手软
<1-8,Chase>That'll teach me to overbill.

12
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:29,030
<1-8,Chase>发件人  豪斯
<1-8,Chase>叮咚

13
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,330
<2-1,House>如果她喜欢瘸子
<2-1,House>If she likes crippled guys,

14
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:41,920
<2-1,House>我倒有六分钟空余时间
<2-1,House>I'm free for the next six minutes.

15
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:43,260
<2-2,Chase>你来做什么
<2-2,Chase>What do you want?

16
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,910
<2-3,House>45岁的卡车司机
<2-3,House>45-year-old truck driver,

17
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,840
<2-3,House>癫痫反复发作
<2-3,House>recurrent seizures.

18
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,310
<2-3,House>没有代谢和结构上的...
<2-3,House>No metabolic or structural--

19
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,850
<2-4,Chase>你觉得现在是时候吗
<2-4,Chase>Does this look like a good time?

20
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:51,890
<2-5,House>算是
<2-5,House>Sort of.

21
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:53,670
<2-5,House>至少和过去三周  我12次
<2-5,House>At least as good as the other 12 times

22
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,420
<2-5,House>打你电话呼你时  情况类似
<2-5,House>that I've called and paged you in the last three weeks.

23
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,780
<2-6,Chase>那是我不想和你说话
<2-6,Chase>Those times I just didn't feel like talking to you.

24
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:58,790
<2-6,Chase>现在也差不多
<2-6,Chase>Kinda like now.

25
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:00,090
<2-7,House>我可以再次道歉
<2-7,House>I'd apologize again,

26
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,440
<2-7,House>不过上次你还没原谅我
<2-7,House>but I'm still waiting for you to accept the first one.

27
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,190
<2-7,House>你可是给我打工的
<2-7,House>You do work for me.

28
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:07,220
<2-7,House>我有权问  你什么时候上班
<2-7,House>I am entitled to ask when you're coming back.

29
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,750
<2-8,Chase>我不知道我什么时候回去
<2-8,Chase>I don't know when I'm coming back.

30
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,310
<2-8,Chase>我不知道我还想不想回去
<2-8,Chase>I don't know if I'm coming back.

31
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,190
<2-8,Chase>你要看不惯
<2-8,Chase>Got a problem with that,

32
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,980
<2-8,Chase>炒了我啊
<2-8,Chase>fire me.

50
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:50,030
<2-8,Chase>总监：
<2-8,Chase>zlean

52
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,770
<3-1,Therapist>做得好
<3-1,Therapist>Nice.

53
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:06,850
<3-2,Foreman>在医院看到你真好
<3-2,Foreman>It's good to see you in the hospital,

54
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:08,750
<3-2,Foreman>哪怕不是来当医生  当病人也好
<3-2,Foreman>as a patient if not as a doctor.

55
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:09,890
<3-3,Chase>相信我
<3-3,Chase>Believe me,

56
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,890
<3-3,Chase>我宁愿是穿白大褂的
<3-3,Chase>I'd rather be the guy with the clipboard.

57
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:16,830
<3-4,Foreman>你怎么样
<3-4,Foreman>How you doing?

58
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,930
<3-5,Chase>不再出现心律失常
<3-5,Chase>Arrhythmias are gone.

59
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,100
<3-5,Chase>精细动作的控制渐好
<3-5,Chase>Fine motor control is improving.

60
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,480
<3-6,Foreman>我指的不是那些
<3-6,Foreman>Not what I meant.

61
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,930
<3-6,Foreman>如果你需要和人谈谈
<3-6,Foreman>If you need to talk to someone,

62
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:28,590
<3-6,Foreman>心理咨询
<3-6,Foreman>a professional...

63
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,760
<3-7,Chase>我很好
<3-7,Chase>I'm fine.

64
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:34,160
<3-8,Foreman>好到可以上班了吗
<3-8,Foreman>Fine enough to get back to work?

65
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:38,340
<3-8,Foreman>你可以不为豪斯工作
<3-8,Foreman>You don't have to work for House,

66
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,650
<3-8,Foreman>但你欠我20小时的门诊
<3-8,Foreman>but you do owe me 20 clinic hours.

67
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:43,640
<3-9,Chase>怎么  挨了一刀我想放个假都不行
<3-9,Chase>What, getting knifed doesn't buy me an extension?

68
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,190
<3-10,Foreman>你想要什么都行
<3-10,Foreman>Buys you whatever you need.

69
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,510
<3-10,Foreman>但我了解你
<3-10,Foreman>But I know you.

70
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,480
<3-10,Foreman>如果你只做理疗
<3-10,Foreman>If all you do is physical therapy

71
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:51,540
<3-10,Foreman>外加同女人鬼混
<3-10,Foreman>and your nighttime version of it,

72
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:52,760
<3-10,Foreman>没等到
<3-10,Foreman>you'll lose your mind

73
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,060
<3-10,Foreman>能重拾精细动作你就疯掉了
<3-10,Foreman>faster than you regain those fine motor skills.

74
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,670
<4-1,Moira>我  我的左肩
<4-1,Moira>I, uh, have this terrible pain

75
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,210
<4-1,Moira>疼得厉害
<4-1,Moira>in my left shoulder.

76
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:12,150
<4-1,Moira>来得莫名其妙
<4-1,Moira>It came out of nowhere.

77
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,750
<4-2,Sister Joan>用什么办法都不见好
<4-2,Sister Joan>And nothing seems to help.

78
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,300
<4-3,Chase>还有其它症状吗
<4-3,Chase>Any other symptoms?

79
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,930
<4-3,Chase>胸痛  头晕
<4-3,Chase>Chest pain? Lightheadedness?

80
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,830
<4-4,Moira>没有  完全没有
<4-4,Moira>No. None at all.

81
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,520
<4-5,Chase>刚开始疼时你在做什么
<4-5,Chase>What were you doing when the pain came on?

82
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,460
<4-6,Moira>就是坐着祈祷
<4-6,Moira>Just sitting and praying.

83
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,730
<4-7,Sister Joan>那天早上她在帮我做圣饼
<4-7,Sister Joan>She'd been helping to make the altar breads that morning,

84
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:33,550
<4-7,Sister Joan>但运动量不大  也没反复性动作
<4-7,Sister Joan>but no hard physical work or repetitive motion.

85
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,250
<4-8,Chase>有很多可能
<4-8,Chase>A couple of possibilities.

86
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:37,210
<4-8,Chase>你的淋巴结肿大
<4-8,Chase>You have enlarged lymph nodes,

87
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,290
<4-8,Chase>我想先排除乳腺癌的可能
<4-8,Chase>so I'd like to start by ruling out breast cancer.

88
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,390
<4-8,Chase>我说的是"排除"
<4-8,Chase>And I do mean "Rule out."

89
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,950
<4-8,Chase>可能并无大碍的
<4-8,Chase>It's probably nothing.

90
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,600
<4-8,Chase>我想做个快速的乳房检查
<4-8,Chase>I'm gonna do a quick breast exam.

91
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,190
<4-8,Chase>你不介意先出去一下吧
<4-8,Chase>Do you mind stepping out for a moment?

92
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,520
<4-9,Sister Joan>不介意
<4-9,Sister Joan>Not at all.

93
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:58,070
<4-10,Chase>这样我才能就第二种可能发问
<4-10,Chase>That was so I could ask about the second possibility.

94
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,400
<4-10,Chase>左肩痛可能是心绞痛的表现
<4-10,Chase>Left-sided pain means it could be angina,

95
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,330
<4-10,Chase>会因压力而加重
<4-10,Chase>which is made worse by stress.

96
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,610
<4-10,Chase>而与人生中某一剧变
<4-10,Chase>Might not be a coincidence that the pain started

97
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:07,170
<4-10,Chase>同时出现  也不是碰巧吧
<4-10,Chase>on the verge of a major life change.

98
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:08,940
<4-11,Moira>你怎么知道
<4-11,Moira>How did you know?

99
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,740
<4-12,Chase>蓝色头巾说明你是预备修女
<4-12,Chase>Blue veil means you're a postulant,

100
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,420
<4-12,Chase>还未发愿
<4-12,Chase>haven't taken your vows yet.

101
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,420
<4-12,Chase>修女经过誓发初愿 复愿 终身愿等过程
<4-12,Chase>表示自己对主的献身

102
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,940
<4-12,Chase>棕色衣着说明你来自加尔默罗会
<4-12,Chase>Brown vestments means you're carmelites,

103
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,200
<4-12,Chase>静修修女
<4-12,Chase>cloistered nuns,

104
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,760
<4-12,Chase>有人监护也与此吻合
<4-12,Chase>which explains the chaperone.

105
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,840
<4-12,Chase>你正打算永离俗世
<4-12,Chase>You're about to withdraw from the world for good.

106
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,810
<4-12,Chase>我曾是神学院学生
<4-12,Chase>I was a seminarian.

107
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,230
<4-13,Moira>显然没发过愿
<4-13,Moira>Who obviously didn't take his vows.

108
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,150
<4-14,Chase>教士服让我臀部显大
<4-14,Chase>Cassock made my ass look fat.

109
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,510
<4-14,Chase>麻烦你解开扣子平躺下来
<4-14,Chase>Do you mind unbuttoning your shirt and lying down for me?

110
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,690
<4-14,Chase>好的
<4-14,Chase>Okay.

111
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:38,530
<4-15,Moira>我也犹豫过
<4-15,Moira>I have had second thoughts.

112
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:41,460
<4-15,Moira>我不够虔诚
<4-15,Moira>I'm kind of a wreck.

113
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,240
<4-16,Chase>与世隔绝
<4-16,Chase>A life of perpetual enclosure

114
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,090
<4-16,Chase>远离尘嚣
<4-16,Chase>and almost complete silence?

115
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,260
<4-16,Chase>如果你这都不慎重考虑
<4-16,Chase>If you weren't wrestling with this,

116
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,220
<4-16,Chase>我只能说你肯定不正常
<4-16,Chase>I'd say there's something really wrong with you.

117
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,630
<4-17,Chase>我得坦白和你说
<4-17,Chase>I'm going to admit you.

118
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,120
<4-17,Chase>这有个小的肿块
<4-17,Chase>There's a little mass here,

119
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,510
<4-17,Chase>我想做个详细检查
<4-17,Chase>and I'd like to get it checked out.

120
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,620
<5-1,Wilson>只是良性脂肪沉积
<5-1,Wilson>It's just a benign fat deposit.

121
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:07,050
<5-1,Wilson>片子没问题
<5-1,Wilson>Her imaging's clean.

122
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:09,210
<5-2,Chase>压力测试也没问题  不是心绞痛
<5-2,Chase>Stress test too. It's not angina.

123
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,110
<5-2,Chase>那为什么会肩痛
<5-2,Chase>So why the shoulder pain?

124
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,960
<5-3,House>有没有可能
<5-3,House>Is it possible

125
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,420
<5-3,House>是她自残
<5-3,House>that she hurt her shoulder?

126
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:18,450
<5-5,Wilson>-真要感谢你  -我没告诉他
<5-5,Wilson>- Thanks a lot. - I didn't tell him.

127
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:20,160
<5-6,House>你刚才行踪诡秘
<5-6,House>You were cagey about where you were going.

128
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:22,530
<5-6,House>奇斯一直小心翼翼
<5-6,House>And Chase being cagey in general.

129
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:24,930
<5-6,House>看似有很大机会  在一处逮住你俩
<5-6,House>Good chance I'd find the two of you in the same cage.

130
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:26,540
<5-6,House>所以我让朴克尾随其后
<5-6,House>So I had Park follow you.

131
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:29,940
<5-7,Adams>你好点没有
<5-7,Adams>How you feeling?

132
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,260
<5-7,Adams>好多了
<5-7,Adams>Better.

133
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,980
<5-8,Chase>听说你手臂恢复得不错
<5-8,Chase>Heard your arm's healing nicely.

134
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,040
<5-9,Taub>看到你能走动真好
<5-9,Taub>Good to see you on your feet.

135
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,400
<5-10,House>病人是修女
<5-10,House>Patient's a nun?

136
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:39,060
<5-10,House>遭遇坎坷让你又重拾
<5-10,House>You turning back to your long-abandoned faith

137
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,290
<5-10,House>早已摒弃的信仰了吗
<5-10,House>in time of trouble?

138
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,920
<5-11,Chase>她是我的门诊病人
<5-11,Chase>She was next up in the clinic.

139
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:43,880
<5-11,Chase>还有  我不需要你帮忙
<5-11,Chase>And I don't want your help.

140
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,340
<5-12,House>你被捅了
<5-12,House>You got stabbed.

141
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,020
<5-12,House>你怪我
<5-12,House>You blame me.

142
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:49,480
<5-13,House>但这么多年来
<5-13,House>But what did you learn about me

143
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:51,470
<5-13,House>你还不了解我吗
<5-13,House>that you hadn't known for years?

144
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,910
<5-14,Chase>也许我以前是傻子  现在不是了
<5-14,Chase>Maybe I was an idiot before and I'm not one now.

145
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:55,480
<5-15,House>也许反过来才是对的
<5-15,House>Or maybe the reverse is true.

146
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:57,920
<5-16,Chase>谢谢你的帮忙
<5-16,Chase>Thanks for all your help.

147
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:07,370
<5-17,House>你的精神伴侣受真菌感染
<5-17,House>Your soul sister is having a fungal infection

148
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:09,920
<5-17,House>源于圣饼里未加工的小麦
<5-17,House>from the unprocessed wheat in the altar breads.

149
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,900
<5-17,House>解释了肩痛及淋巴结肿大
<5-17,House>Explains the shoulder pain and the jumbo lymph nodes.

<5-18,House>谢谢我的帮忙
<5-18,House>Thanks for all my help.

151
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:29,930
<6-1,Park>抱歉  我把豪斯带了过来
<6-1,Park>I'm-- I'm sorry I led House to you.

152
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,900
<6-2,Chase>这是工作的一部分
<6-2,Chase>It's part of the job.

153
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,700
<6-3,Park>要不下班一起吃个晚饭
<6-3,Park>Maybe we could get a meal after work tonight,

154
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,040
<6-3,Park>如果你需要人陪的话
<6-3,Park>if you want some companionship.

155
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,400
<6-4,Chase>你是在约我吗
<6-4,Chase>You asking me out on a date?

156
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:42,820
<6-4,Chase>没有
<6-4,Chase>No.

157
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,940
<6-5,Park>我只是...越描越黑了
<6-5,Park>I just-- I guess that sounded--

158
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,220
<6-5,Park>回来肯定有负担的
<6-5,Park>Must be scary to be back.

159
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,500
<6-5,Park>手术刀啊  针头啊
<6-5,Park>All those knives and needles.

160
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:55,290
<6-5,Park>放眼到处是受感染的血液和组织
<6-5,Park>Infected blood and tissue everywhere you look.

161
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,740
<6-5,Park>只是觉得你需要和人谈谈
<6-5,Park>Just thought you might need someone to talk to about it.

162
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:02,700
<6-6,Chase>知道有你关心我  就足够了
<6-6,Chase>Just knowing you're there for me is enough.

163
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:04,060
<6-6,Chase>谢谢
<6-6,Chase>Thanks.

164
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:11,920
<7-1,Moira>在季拉海滩冲过浪没
<7-1,Moira>Ever surf Kirra point?

165
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:16,170
<7-1,Moira>很明显你是澳洲人
<7-1,Moira>Obviously you're australian.

166
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,840
<7-2,Chase>整个黄金海岸我都玩过
<7-2,Chase>I've surfed all over the Gold Coast.

167
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:21,930
<7-2,Chase>别告诉我你也是
<7-2,Chase>Don't tell me you have.

168
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:23,950
<7-3,Moira>离我最近的是威美亚湾
<7-3,Moira>The closest I got was Waimea Bay.

169
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,510
<7-3,Moira>我在毛伊岛长大的
<7-3,Moira>I grew up on Maui.

170
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:30,150
<7-4,Chase>恕我冒昧
<7-4,Chase>If you don't mind me asking,

171
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,080
<7-4,Chase>你为什么要当修女
<7-4,Chase>why are you becoming a nun?

172
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,600
<7-5,Moira>因为我冲浪所以你这么问
<7-5,Moira>You asking 'cause I surf?

173
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:37,350
<7-6,Chase>虽然我知道耶稣曾水上行走  但
<7-6,Chase>Well, I know that Jesus walked on water but...

174
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:40,940
<7-6,Chase>况且大多预备修女要比你年轻
<7-6,Chase>Plus the average postulant is a lot younger than you.

175
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,520
<7-6,Chase>你之前是做什么的啊
<7-6,Chase>What were you doing before this?

176
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,350
<7-7,Moira>没什么特别的
<7-7,Moira>Not much of anything.

177
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,540
<7-7,Moira>做做保姆  居无定所
<7-7,Moira>Worked as a nanny. Moved around a lot.

178
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,270
<7-7,Moira>交了几个烂男友  都没成
<7-7,Moira>Bunch of failed relationships.

179
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,780
<7-7,Moira>之后呢
<7-7,Moira>And then what?

180
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:54,210
<7-8,Chase>上帝与你交流  你听到了上帝的召唤吗
<7-8,Chase>God spoke to you? You heard the calling?

181
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,000
<7-8,Chase>差不多
<7-8,Chase>Something like that.

182
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:01,230
<7-9,Moira>感知到上帝的存在
<7-9,Moira>Does there have to be some dramatic moment

183
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,630
<7-9,Moira>有必要很戏剧化吗
<7-9,Moira>where the skies part?

184
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,660
<7-10,Chase>一般是的
<7-10,Chase>Usually, yeah.

185
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,720
<7-11,Moira>你进神学院的时候是不是就那样
<7-11,Moira>Is that what happened to you when you entered the seminary?

186
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,420
<7-12,Chase>妈妈酗酒  爸爸不停地工作
<7-12,Chase>Mom drank, dad worked.

187
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,330
<7-12,Chase>把我丢在一个天主教会学校
<7-12,Chase>They stuck me in catholic school.

188
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,390
<7-12,Chase>那些神父和修女就是我的亲人
<7-12,Chase>Priests and nuns were the closest I had to family.

189
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:21,100
<7-12,Chase>这也不足以让我一辈子当牧师
<7-12,Chase>Turned out that wasn't much of a reason to join the priesthood.

190
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,460
<7-13,Moira>这就是你离开的原因吗
<7-13,Moira>Is that why you left?

191
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:25,810
<7-14,Chase>差不多
<7-14,Chase>Something like that.

192
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:35,730
<7-15,Moira>我感觉我快吐了
<7-15,Moira>I think I may throw up.

193
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:48,480
<7-16,Moira>我到底生什么病了
<7-16,Moira>What's wrong with me?

194
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:50,840
<7-17,Chase>肯定不是真菌感染
<7-17,Chase>Not a fungal infection.

195
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,680
<8-1,House>你可能在想  我为什么要把气球装满汽水
<8-1,House>You're probably wondering, why the soda balloons?

196
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,880
<8-2,Chase>没有
<8-2,Chase>I'm not.

197
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,430
<8-3,House>那我告诉你
<8-3,House>Well, I'll tell you.

198
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:06,910
<8-3,House>你不是第一个
<8-3,House>You're not the only one

199
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,630
<8-3,House>被人一刀捅进心室后
<8-3,House>whose life spiraled out of control

200
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:10,330
<8-3,House>生活就变成一团乱麻的人
<8-3,House>when you got knifed in the ventricle.

201
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:11,250
<8-3,House>陶博决定
<8-3,House>Taub has decided--

202
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,870
<8-4,Chase>我需要你帮我诊断我的病人
<8-4,Chase>I need help with my patient.

203
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,170
<8-4,Chase>她在呕吐
<8-4,Chase>She's vomiting.

204
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,850
<8-4,Chase>这不是真菌感染造成的
<8-4,Chase>That's not from a fungal infection.

205
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:16,670
<8-5,House>既然你现在不为我工作了
<8-5,House>What are you planning to do

206
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,210
<8-5,House>你打算怎么办
<8-5,House>now that you're not working for me?

207
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:19,510
<8-6,Chase>我不知道
<8-6,Chase>I have no idea.

208
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,120
<8-6,Chase>一次濒死的经历让我感觉
<8-6,Chase>Almost dying's been clarifying.

209
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:23,420
<8-6,Chase>我能做任何事
<8-6,Chase>I can do anything.

210
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,040
<8-7,House>你能做任何事
<8-7,House>You can do anything.

211
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:27,140
<8-7,House>结果你却回到
<8-7,House>So you come back to the same building

212
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,630
<8-7,House>工作了多年的大楼
<8-7,House>you've worked in for years.

213
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:31,380
<8-7,House>我想你该把这条从你的清单上划掉了
<8-7,House>Guess you can cross that off your bucket list.

214
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:33,200
<8-8,Chase>能继续讨论我的病人吗
<8-8,Chase>Can we get to my patient sometime soon?

215
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:36,090
<8-9,House>只要你承认你现在一片迷茫  就没问题
<8-9,House>As soon as you admit that you're a confused mess, sure.

216
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,350
<8-10,Chase>你会帮我的
<8-10,Chase>You'll help me,

217
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:40,070
<8-10,Chase>因为就算你感觉这个病例很无聊
<8-10,Chase>'cause even though you don't find my case interesting,

218
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:42,140
<8-10,Chase>但你会好奇我那么在意
<8-10,Chase>you find my interest in it interesting.

219
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,810
<8-11,House>你要这么说的话
<8-11,House>Well, when you put it that way...

220
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,890
<8-11,House>胆管炎
<8-11,House>Ascending cholangitis.

221
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:54,270
<8-12,Taub>没打着
<8-12,Taub>Missed me.

222
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,940
<8-13,Chase>不可能  胆红素正常
<8-13,Chase>Can't be, bilirubin's normal.

223
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,740
<8-14,House>临床体征会比检查报告快
<8-14,House>Clinical signs can show up days before lab signs.

224
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:06,750
<8-16,House>这太好了
<8-16,House>This is great.

225
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,470
<8-16,House>我们应该经常玩这游戏
<8-16,House>We should make this a regular thing.

226
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,150
<9-1,Nurse>她的脚没知觉了
<9-1,Nurse>She can't feel her foot at all.

227
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:19,660
<9-2,Moira>这是怎么回事
<9-2,Moira>What does this mean?

228
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:23,760
<9-3,Chase>这就是说我得多咨询咨询我的同事了
<9-3,Chase>It means I've got to spend more time consulting with a colleague.

230
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,330
<9-3,Chase>17-酮类固醇水平偏低
<9-3,Chase>17-ketosteroid levels are low.

231
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:32,990
<10-1,Adams>他怎么可能性欲超级旺盛
<10-1,Adams>How can he be hyper-sexual?

232
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,200
<10-2,House>你离他更近  他却想舌吻朴克
<10-2,House>He tried to tongue-kiss Park when you were closer.

233
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:37,800
<10-2,House>你认为他的性欲正常吗
<10-2,House>You think his sexuality is normal?

234
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:40,650
<10-3,Chase>我需要帮助  我的病人有了新症状
<10-3,Chase>I need more help. My patient has a new symptom.

235
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:41,990
<10-3,Chase>足部缺血
<10-3,Chase>Ischemic foot.

236
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:43,890
<10-3,Chase>别在那想怎么损我了
<10-3,Chase>Get the lecture out of your system

237
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:45,210
<10-3,Chase>我们讨论讨论这个病例吧
<10-3,Chase>so we can talk about my case.

238
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,990
<10-4,House>让我先说一则寓言啊
<10-4,House>Let me start with an allegory.

239
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:00,120
<10-6,Chase>好吧  我有点兴趣
<10-6,Chase>Okay, I'm curious.

240
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:03,390
<10-7,House>你对于你被捅的事反应过激
<10-7,House>Your overreaction to your stabbing

241
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:06,080
<10-7,House>是为了怪我  即便你很崇拜我
<10-7,House>is to blame me even as you are drawn to me.

242
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:09,520
<10-7,House>陶博则选择上笨蛋防身术课程
<10-7,House>Taub's is to take moronic self-defense classes.

243
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,440
<10-7,House>就那花拳绣腿一点用都没有
<10-7,House>That won't defend him against anything.

244
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,060
<10-8,Taub>以色列搏击防身术
<10-8,Taub>Krav maga,

245
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,500
<10-8,Taub>能帮我挡住你的攻击
<10-8,Taub>which helped me block your shot

246
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,250
<10-8,Taub>还能帮我
<10-8,Taub>and will continue to help me

247
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,460
<10-8,Taub>在一个住满嗑药者的楼里
<10-8,Taub>defend myself in a building

248
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,150
<10-8,Taub>保护我自己
<10-8,Taub>full of drugged-up strangers.

249
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:22,510
<10-9,House>陶博应该听从本能和遗传基因
<10-9,House>Taub has to accept that by instinct and genetics

250
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,700
<10-9,House>承认他是个懦夫
<10-9,House>he is a coward,

251
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,210
<10-9,House>最适合在出现危险的时候
<10-9,House>who's better off running and hiding

252
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:26,270
<10-9,House>逃跑或是躲起来
<10-9,House>at the first sign of danger.

253
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:29,010
<10-10,Taub>我已经一口气挡住了六发彩蛋
<10-10,Taub>I've already fended off six of your blitzkriegs in a row.

254
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:31,400
<10-11,House>那第七个  第八个呢
<10-11,House>And the seventh? And the eighth?

255
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,330
<10-11,House>第N个呢
<10-11,House>And the nth?

256
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:34,410
<10-12,Chase>就算你打到他了  你能证明什么呢
<10-12,Chase>If you get him, what's that gonna prove?

257
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:36,160
<10-13,House>证明有时会出意外
<10-13,House>That unexpected things happen.

258
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:37,770
<10-13,House>就字面上的意思来说
<10-13,House>By definition,

259
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:39,630
<10-13,House>没有哪个课会教你预期意外
<10-13,House>no class can teach you to expect them.

260
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:42,080
<10-13,House>所以陶博去学那些就是犯傻
<10-13,House>Which is why Taub is idiotic to study them,

261
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,560
<10-13,House>而你认为那事有多么重要  也是犯傻
<10-13,House>and you're idiotic to attach any significance to them.

262
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:46,420
<10-14,House>有血凝块
<10-14,House>Blood clot.

263
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,130
<10-15,Chase>她的D-二聚体正常
<10-15,Chase>Her D-dimer's normal.

264
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,760
<10-16,House>另外
<10-16,House>On the other hand--

265
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,750
<10-17,Taub>如果他说对了血阻
<10-17,Taub>What if he's right about the blockage

266
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,110
<10-18,Adams>但弄错了原因呢
<10-18,Adams>but wrong about the cause?

267
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:01,740
<10-18,Adams>血管痉挛
<10-18,Adams>Vasospasm.

268
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,970
<10-19,Chase>除了淋巴结  它能解释所有症状
<10-19,Chase>That explains everything but the lymph nodes.

269
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:06,540
<10-19,Chase>任何小感染都能引起那些淋巴结问题
<10-19,Chase>And any minor infection could have caused those.

270
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,610
<10-20,House>给她用钙离子拮抗剂
<10-20,House>Calcium channel blocker to treat.

271
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,170
<11-1,Adams>你没事吧
<11-1,Adams>Are you okay?

272
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,690
<11-2,Chase>我把手术刀带进病房  差点害死你
<11-2,Chase>I almost got you killed by bringing a scalpel into that room.

273
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:25,810
<11-2,Chase>我可不好受
<11-2,Chase>I could feel better about that.

274
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:27,310
<11-3,Adams>但你也救了我的命
<11-3,Adams>You saved my life too.

275
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,250
<11-3,Adams>这就两清了吧
<11-3,Adams>I think the ledger's clear.

276
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,650
<11-3,Adams>但你怎么会没有受到心理伤害呢
<11-3,Adams>But how can you not be traumatized?

277
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:35,440
<11-4,Chase>因为改变不了已经发生的事实
<11-4,Chase>Can't change what happened.

278
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,150
<11-4,Chase>但能让我今后做出更好的抉择
<11-4,Chase>Can only make better choices from here.

279
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:40,340
<11-5,Adams>你能说满口大道理
<11-5,Adams>So you're zen about it

280
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,670
<11-5,Adams>但你还生豪斯的气
<11-5,Adams>but won't let go of your anger toward House?

281
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,640
<11-5,Adams>我在咨询心理医生
<11-5,Adams>I'm seeing a trauma counselor.

282
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,660
<11-5,Adams>我觉得你也应该去
<11-5,Adams>I think you should too.

283
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:51,080
<11-6,Chase>我没事的
<11-6,Chase>I'm okay.

284
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:53,720
<11-6,Chase>知道有你关心我  就足够了
<11-6,Chase>Just knowing you're there for me is enough.

285
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,480
<12-1,Chase>修道院能让你有这东西吗
<12-1,Chase>Convent lets you have this?

286
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:06,640
<12-2,Moira>我从一个护士那借的
<12-2,Moira>I borrowed it from one of the nurses.

287
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:08,980
<12-2,Moira>我现在还只是预备修女
<12-2,Moira>I'm still on temporary vows.

288
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:11,710
<12-2,Moira>艾米纳姆  美国饶舌歌星
<12-2,Moira>九次获得格莱美奖

289
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:11,710
<12-2,Moira>这可能是我最后一次听艾米纳姆的歌了
<12-2,Moira>It may be the last time I hear Eminem for a while.

290
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,170
<12-3,Chase>你在用iPod
<12-3,Chase>You're using an iPod.

291
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:17,080
<12-3,Chase>但我从没见你用过念珠
<12-3,Chase>But I've never seen you use rosary beads.

292
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:23,620
<12-4,Chase>耶稣哪一天离世
<12-4,Chase>What day did Jesus die?

293
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,710
<12-5,Moira>我知道  一个福音说他已死
<12-5,Moira>I know, one gospel says passover,

294
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:28,540
<12-5,Moira>另一个说在之前一天
<12-5,Moira>another says the day before.

295
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:30,090
<12-6,Chase>在彼得第三次否认认识耶稣前
<12-6,Chase>How many times did the cock crow

296
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:31,610
<12-6,Chase>公鸡一共叫了多少次
<12-6,Chase>before Peter's third denial?

297
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:33,720
<12-6,Chase>一次还是两次
<12-6,Chase>Once or twice?

298
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:36,140
<12-7,Moira>信仰不会因你的质疑而改变
<12-7,Moira>You can't argue away my faith.

299
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,210
<12-7,Moira>为什么
<12-7,Moira>Why?

300
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:39,040
<12-8,Chase>因为就算有矛盾的地方
<12-8,Chase>Because it's so strong

301
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,110
<12-8,Chase>信仰的力量也十分强大
<12-8,Chase>even plain contradictions--

302
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,930
<12-9,Moira>因为它没那么强大
<12-9,Moira>Because it's not that strong.

303
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:45,550
<12-9,Moira>我不是说我没有信仰
<12-9,Moira>I'm not saying I don't have faith.

304
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:49,130
<12-9,Moira>我只是还没感受到神启而已
<12-9,Moira>I just haven't felt the calling yet.

305
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:52,270
<12-10,Chase>人只有感到召唤  才会想成为神职人员
<12-10,Chase>No one joins the clergy without having that epiphany.

306
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:55,400
<12-10,Chase>切身体会到上帝的博爱
<12-10,Chase>That god's love is speaking to you directly.

307
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:59,730
<12-11,Moira>我要的是安静  沉思
<12-11,Moira>It's the silence, the contemplation,

308
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:00,670
<12-11,Moira>生活的秩序
<12-11,Moira>the order.

309
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,580
<12-11,Moira>我需要它们
<12-11,Moira>I need them.

310
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,460
<12-11,Moira>希望其他的圣训之后会来
<12-11,Moira>Hoping everything else will come later.

311
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:10,210
<12-12,Chase>这不是答案
<12-12,Chase>That's not an answer.

312
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,460
<12-12,Chase>如果你想要安静  带上耳塞就行了
<12-12,Chase>If you want silence, you can get ear plugs.

313
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,660
<12-13,Moira>我见识过外面的世界了
<12-13,Moira>I tried the outside world.

314
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,300
<12-13,Moira>填补不了我的心灵
<12-13,Moira>It wasn't enough.

315
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:19,030
<12-14,Chase>你结过婚吗
<12-14,Chase>Have you been married?

316
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,180
<12-15,Moira>没有
<12-15,Moira>No.

317
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:22,200
<12-16,Chase>没孩子  也没事业
<12-16,Chase>No kids. You never found a career.

318
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,750
<12-16,Chase>你好像没怎么见识过外面的世界啊
<12-16,Chase>Doesn't sound like the outside world got much of a try.

319
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,740
<12-16,Chase>而你即将踏入的生活
<12-16,Chase>What you're headed towards now,

320
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,710
<12-16,Chase>是每天安静地祈祷14小时
<12-16,Chase>14 hours a day in silent prayer,

321
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:34,820
<12-16,Chase>没有家庭
<12-16,Chase>never having a family,

322
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:37,120
<12-16,Chase>不和别人接触
<12-16,Chase>never touching another human being.

323
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,820
<12-17,Moira>那些是你想要的吧
<12-17,Moira>Just because that's what you'd miss the most.

324
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:43,080
<12-17,Moira>护士很八卦的
<12-17,Moira>The nurses talk.

325
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,060
<12-18,Chase>及时行乐没什么错
<12-18,Chase>Nothing's wrong with having fun.

326
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:52,000
<12-19,Moira>他们说你三周前差点死了
<12-19,Moira>They said you were almost killed three weeks ago.

327
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,530
<12-19,Moira>可你紧接着就找乐子去了
<12-19,Moira>You go right back to fun?

328
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,440
<12-20,Chase>这是你当修女的原因吗
<12-20,Chase>Is that why you wanna be a nun?

329
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,490
<12-20,Chase>有人伤了你的心
<12-20,Chase>Someone broke your heart.

330
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,270
<12-20,Chase>没有
<12-20,Chase>No.

331
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,320
<12-21,Moira>我只是在追寻更重要的事
<12-21,Moira>I'm just looking for something more.

332
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:11,250
<12-22,Chase>我也是
<12-22,Chase>So am I.

333
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,620
<12-23,Chase>我门诊要迟到了
<12-23,Chase>I'm late for work in the clinic.

334
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:43,860
<13-1,Chase>不是吧
<13-1,Chase>Really?

335
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:45,800
<13-1,Chase>乔治·华盛贝姆
<13-1,Chase>George Washingbaum?

336
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,370
<13-2,Taub>是《摩登原始人》里的人物
<13-2,Taub>He was a character in the Flintsteins.

337
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,880
<13-2,Taub>我只是在这躲到豪斯离开咖啡厅
<13-2,Taub>Just hiding out till House leaves the cafeteria.

338
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,500
<13-3,Chase>你上的那些自卫课程
<13-3,Chase>The self-defense classes,

339
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,220
<13-3,Chase>觉得学了有什么不一样吗
<13-3,Chase>you think they're making any kind of difference?

340
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,050
<13-4,Taub>倒还不如豪斯的突袭
<13-4,Taub>Not as much as House's surprise attacks.

341
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:05,490
<13-4,Taub>他的预先谋划  让我也得如此
<13-4,Taub>He thinks three steps ahead, so I do too.

342
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,850
<13-4,Taub>所以你应该接受他的道歉
<13-4,Taub>Which is why you should accept his apology

343
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:10,140
<13-4,Taub>并回到团队中来
<13-4,Taub>and come back on the team.

344
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:12,340
<13-4,Taub>他很烦人也很神经
<13-4,Taub>He's annoying, he's maddening.

345
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:14,460
<13-4,Taub>但他让我们变得更好
<13-4,Taub>But he makes us all better.

346
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,500
<13-5,Chase>了解了
<13-5,Chase>Note to self.

347
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,390
<13-5,Chase>足部颜色良好
<13-5,Chase>Foot color's good.

348
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,370
<14-1,Chase>动脉搏动良好
<14-1,Chase>Arterial pulse is good.

349
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:29,330
<14-1,Chase>毛细血管再灌注良好
<14-1,Chase>Capillary refill's good.

350
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:31,080
<14-2,Sister Joan>并且肩膀疼痛也消失了
<14-2,Sister Joan>And her shoulder pain is all gone.

351
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:34,270
<14-3,Chase>看上去你可以回家了
<14-3,Chase>Looks like you're ready to go home.

352
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:36,330
<14-4,Sister Joan>我去取车咱们门口见
<14-4,Sister Joan>I'll get the car and meet you out front.

353
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,330
<14-5,Chase>我想说我就在书里
<14-5,Chase>I'd say I'm in the book,

354
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:45,430
<14-5,Chase>不过从今以后你不会有机会读了
<14-5,Chase>but not the one you'll be reading from now on.

355
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:57,110
<14-6,Moira>六年前我在火奴鲁鲁当保姆
<14-6,Moira>Six years ago, I was a nanny in Honolulu

356
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,390
<14-6,Moira>照顾一个两岁的可爱小孩
<14-6,Moira>for this beautiful two-year-old boy.

357
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:02,300
<14-6,Moira>我很爱他
<14-6,Moira>I loved him.

358
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,170
<14-6,Moira>他跟我在一起的时间
<14-6,Moira>Probably spent more time with him

359
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,310
<14-6,Moira>可能比跟他父母都长
<14-6,Moira>than his own parents.

360
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,760
<14-6,Moira>一天我在停车场和别的保姆聊天
<14-6,Moira>One day I was in the park talking with another nanny.

361
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:16,470
<14-6,Moira>他从沙箱里爬到了大街上
<14-6,Moira>He wandered out of the sandbox into the street,

362
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,430
<14-6,Moira>爬到了行驶中的汽车前
<14-6,Moira>into the path of a moving car.

363
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:24,740
<14-7,Chase>这可能发生在任何人身上
<14-7,Chase>That could have happened to anyone.

364
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,330
<14-8,Moira>我不这么认为
<14-8,Moira>I don't think so.

365
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:30,080
<14-8,Moira>就算是  他们也会在余生
<14-8,Moira>And even if it did, they'd blame themselves

366
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,820
<14-8,Moira>因此而自责
<14-8,Moira>for the rest of their lives too.

367
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:33,550
<14-9,Chase>你不应该
<14-9,Chase>You shouldn't.

368
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:38,890
<14-9,Chase>你不该从本可能幸福的生活中逃离
<14-9,Chase>You shouldn't run from what can still be a good life.

369
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,300
<14-10,Moira>我投奔了上帝
<14-10,Moira>I'm running to god.

370
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,050
<14-10,Moira>在你身上发生了这些事后
<14-10,Moira>After what happened to you,

371
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:45,840
<14-10,Moira>你不想重新规划你的人生吗
<14-10,Moira>don't you wanna remake your life?

372
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,990
<14-11,Chase>至少我不会逃避
<14-11,Chase>Not by hiding myself away.

373
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:53,710
<14-11,Chase>希望这对你有所帮助
<14-11,Chase>I hope it works out for you.

374
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,370
<14-12,Moira>其实会很难
<14-12,Moira>It is gonna be hard.

375
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:03,030
<14-12,Moira>不能和人有所接触
<14-12,Moira>Not touching anyone.

376
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:50,960
<15-1,House>谁能想到圣母的下属居然是个辣妹
<15-1,House>Who knew mother inferior was a smoking hottie.

377
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:52,980
<15-1,House>难怪你跟她调情
<15-1,House>No wonder you're playing handsies with her.

378
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,370
<15-2,Chase>你觉得我对修女有意思
<15-2,Chase>You think I'm hitting on a nun?

379
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,000
<15-2,Chase>对上帝不满还是我想要挑战
<15-2,Chase>Angry at god or I just need a challenge?

380
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,430
<15-3,House>或者你只是害怕和别人关系密切
<15-3,House>Or you're terrified of intimacy,

381
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:02,340
<15-3,House>因此你到处留情
<15-3,House>which is why you're a serial slut.

382
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:05,900
<15-3,House>不过现在你急于想抓住一只情感的救生艇
<15-3,House>But right now you're grasping at an emotional life raft.

383
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:08,810
<15-3,House>那些不可能产生亲密关系的人正是理想人选
<15-3,House>Ideally someone for whom intimacy's not an option.

384
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,370
<15-3,House>这其实挺有道理的  所以我也不能
<15-3,House>That actually makes sense, which I can't say

385
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:12,790
<15-3,House>对你的所做所为妄加评论
<15-3,House>about anything else you've been doing.

386
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:14,660
<15-4,Chase>我没和她有任何感情纠葛
<15-4,Chase>I'm not emotionally involved with her.

387
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,200
<15-4,Chase>虽然我很喜欢听你反驳我
<15-4,Chase>And much as I'd love to hear you contradict me,

388
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,930
<15-4,Chase>不过我七点半在史卡拉歌剧院还有个探索
<15-4,Chase>I have a 7:30 appointment to explore my intimacy issues

389
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:21,140
<15-4,Chase>亲密关系的约会
<15-4,Chase>at La Scala.

390
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,890
<15-4,Chase>我和这个经纪人聊过  他有点邋遢
<15-4,Chase>I'm talking to this agent. He's a bit of a sleaze.

391
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:27,950
<16-1,Leisha>不过他对于当我的经纪人很兴奋
<16-1,Leisha>But he's really excited about representing me.

392
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,290
<16-2,Leisha>尽管他现在不能接新客户
<16-2,Leisha>Although he can't take on any new clients right now,

393
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:31,270
<16-2,Leisha>不过他正试着替我争取
<16-2,Leisha>he's trying to get me an audition

394
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:33,230
<16-2,Leisha>网络肥皂剧的试演
<16-2,Leisha>for one of those online soaps.

395
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:34,620
<16-2,Leisha>你以前看过网上的片子吗
<16-2,Leisha>Have you ever watched one of those?

396
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:39,690
<16-2,Leisha>我让你觉得无聊了吗
<16-2,Leisha>Am I boring you?

397
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:45,800
<16-3,Chase>很不幸  是这样的
<16-3,Chase>Unfortunately, yeah.

398
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:47,670
<16-3,Chase>抱歉
<16-3,Chase>Sorry.

399
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:05,770
<16-3,Chase>你不该在这的
<16-3,Chase>You're not supposed to be here.

400
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:08,400
<17-1,Moira>或是任何地方
<17-1,Moira>Or anywhere.

401
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,420
<17-2,Chase>没错
<17-2,Chase>Yeah.

402
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,860
<17-3,Moira>你是对的
<17-3,Moira>You were right.

403
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,070
<17-3,Moira>我是在逃避
<17-3,Moira>I was running away.

404
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:01,100
<18-1,Chase>现在你害羞了
<18-1,Chase>Oh, now you're shy.

405
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,370
<18-2,Moira>早上有点亮
<18-2,Moira>It's brighter in the morning.

406
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:15,460
<18-3,Chase>我们的余生是要在
<18-3,Chase>So are we gonna spend the rest of eternity

407
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:18,480
<18-3,Chase>被拿木棍的尖尾小恶魔指指点点的
<18-3,Chase>in a lake of fire while pointy-tailed demons

408
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,250
<18-3,Chase>火湖里度过了吗
<18-3,Chase>poke at us with sticks?

409
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:26,570
<18-4,Moira>这有点吓到我了
<18-4,Moira>This is a little scary for me.

410
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:29,080
<18-4,Moira>我的一生本来都计划好了
<18-4,Moira>I had a whole life planned.

411
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,990
<18-4,Moira>不是说我没挣扎过
<18-4,Moira>Not that I wasn't struggling with it.

412
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:34,330
<18-4,Moira>直到我遇见了你
<18-4,Moira>And then I met you.

413
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:39,140
<18-4,Moira>别担心  我知道你不是那种保持关系的类型
<18-4,Moira>Don't worry, I know you're not the relationship type.

414
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:41,050
<18-5,Chase>我怎么会不是那种类型
<18-5,Chase>I'm not not the relationship type.

415
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:42,420
<18-5,Chase>我结过婚的
<18-5,Chase>I was married once.

416
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:44,480
<18-6,Moira>放松
<18-6,Moira>Relax.

417
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,600
<18-6,Moira>你挺好的
<18-6,Moira>You're fine.

418
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:49,650
<18-7,Chase>你下一步打算怎么办
<18-7,Chase>So what's next for you?

419
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,840
<18-8,Moira>我得找个地方住下
<18-8,Moira>I have to find a place to live.

420
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:57,090
<18-8,Moira>找回以前的工作
<18-8,Moira>Get my old job back.

421
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:01,390
<18-8,Moira>当然  我会感到内疚  开始自我怀疑
<18-8,Moira>Sure, I'll feel guilty, start doubting.

422
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:03,490
<18-9,Chase>只要你能按一样的方式处理
<18-9,Chase>As long as you keep dealing with your doubts

423
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:05,130
<18-9,Chase>自我怀疑的问题那...
<18-9,Chase>in the same way then...

424
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:09,580
<18-9,Chase>莫伊拉
<18-9,Chase>Moira?

425
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,690
<18-10,Moira>不好意思  你刚才说什么了
<18-10,Moira>I'm sorry, did you say something?

426
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,080
<18-11,Chase>你的脖子
<18-11,Chase>Your neck.

427
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,030
<18-12,Moira>怎么了
<18-12,Moira>What?

428
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,030
<18-13,Chase>你是不是耳鸣
<18-13,Chase>Are your ears ringing?

429
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,130
<18-13,Chase>没错
<18-13,Chase>Yeah.

430
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:23,230
<18-14,Moira>这意味着什么
<18-14,Moira>What does that mean?

431
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,760
<18-15,Chase>我得马上把你送回医院
<18-15,Chase>We've got to get you back to the hospital right away.

432
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,250
<19-1,Chase>将血液送入你大脑的动脉
<19-1,Chase>The artery that's bringing blood to your brain,

433
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:31,480
<19-1,Chase>发生了破裂
<19-1,Chase>It's coming apart.

434
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,910
<19-1,Chase>意味着你可能中风
<19-1,Chase>Means you could stroke.

435
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,720
<19-1,Chase>我已经通知了最好的医生团队
<19-1,Chase>I've paged a team of our best doctors.

436
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,710
<19-2,Moira>我不像刚才咳嗽得那么厉害了
<19-2,Moira>I don't have to cough as much.

437
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:38,940
<19-3,Chase>血液凝结了
<19-3,Chase>It's clotted up.

438
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,400
<19-4,Moira>这不好吗
<19-4,Moira>Is that bad?

439
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,580
<19-5,Chase>我们快到了
<19-5,Chase>We're almost there.

440
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:45,780
<19-5,Chase>告诉我她的血氧含量
<19-5,Chase>Get me her O-two level.

442
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:50,970
<20-2,Park>能把她的手腕放到正确的位置
<20-2,Park>I can position her wrist properly.

443
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:52,570
<20-3,Chase>-做什么  -血气分析
<20-3,Chase>- For what? - A.B.G.

444
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:54,860
<20-4,Park>我不要血气分析  知道血氧饱和度就好
<20-4,Park>I don't need an A.B.G. Just get a pulse OX.

445
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,260
<20-5,Chase>我自己来  去拿知情同意书
<20-5,Chase>I'll do it. Grab a consent form.

446
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,900
<20-5,Chase>快去
<20-5,Chase>Go!

447
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,590
<20-5,Chase>我们要马上做手术  好吗
<20-5,Chase>We need to operate right now, okay?

448
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:03,260
<20-6,Moira>做手术好
<20-6,Moira>Good to operate.

449
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:08,250
<20-7,Chase>跟我说  这事没有如果  而且  或可是
<20-7,Chase>Repeat this, no ifs, ands, or buts about it.

450
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:11,170
<20-8,Moira>没有这事  没有如果
<20-8,Moira>No about it and no ifs.

451
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:12,550
<20-9,Chase>把她送到十一号手术室
<20-9,Chase>Get her into O.R.11.

<21-1,Chase>and some Broca's aphasia.

455
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:24,150
<21-1,Chase>一定是有血块
<21-1,Chase>It's got to be a clot

456
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,750
<21-1,Chase>阻止了出血
<21-1,Chase>keeping her from bleeding out.

457
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:26,320
<21-2,Taub>脉搏

<21-3,Chase>20?

461
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,170
<21-4,House>我以为她刚到
<21-4,House>Thought she just got here.

462
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:38,140
<21-4,House>血迹看上去已经干了
<21-4,House>That blood looks pretty dry.

463
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:40,130
<21-4,House>刮胡子时割到的吗
<21-4,House>Cut yourself shaving?

464
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:42,260
<21-4,House>要知道也可能是
<21-4,House>You know, that can happen

465
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:45,500
<21-4,House>修女起床时咳在你身上的
<21-4,House>when the nun you woke up with coughs blood on you.

466
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,860
<21-5,Taub>你和修女上床了
<21-5,Taub>You slept with a nun?

467
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,840
<21-6,Adams>修女就罢了  你和病人上床了
<21-6,Adams>Forget nun, you slept with a patient?

<21-7,Chase>前修女以及前病人
<21-7,Chase>Former, to both.

00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,090
<21-8,House>颈内损伤  令人印象深刻
<21-8,House>Internal neck trauma, that's impressive.

470
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:56,000
<21-8,House>我以前也碰到过几次
<21-8,House>It's happened to me a few times.

471
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,310
<21-8,House>来击个掌

<21-9,Nurse>奇斯医生
<21-9,Nurse>Dr. Chase.

473
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:03,410
<21-10,Chase>血块破裂了
<21-10,Chase>Clot's broken.

474
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,250
<21-10,Chase>送她进去把她鼻子包好
<21-10,Chase>Bring her in and pack her nose.

475
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:06,860
<21-10,Chase>我需要三号可吸收缝线
<21-10,Chase>I'm gonna need number three vicryls.

00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,310
<21-10,Chase>我要治好她
<21-10,Chase>I'm gonna fix this.

477
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,150
<21-11,Adams>你不能给她做手术
<21-11,Adams>You're not gonna operate on her.

478
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:11,780
<21-12,Chase>卡普尔和卡里尔没有空
<21-12,Chase>Kapur and Carlyle are unavailable.

479
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:14,090
<21-12,Chase>赖利做过的手术远没有我多
<21-12,Chase>Reilly's done far fewer dissections than I have.

480
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:16,010
<21-13,Taub>赖利和她上床的次数也没有你多
<21-13,Taub>He's also slept with her far fewer times than you have.

481
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:17,430
<21-14,Adams>你的判断受影响了
<21-14,Adams>Your judgment's compromised.

482
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:18,350
<21-15,Chase>我和她过夜
<21-15,Chase>I spent the night with her.

483
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,180
<21-15,Chase>并不会影响我怎么下刀
<21-15,Chase>Doesn't change how I make an incision.

484
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,560
<21-16,Adams>你来和他说
<21-16,Adams>Tell him!

485
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,480
<21-17,House>去做手术吧
<21-17,House>Do the surgery.

486
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:27,750
<21-18,Adams>你这是不顾病人的安危
<21-18,Adams>You're trying to score points with him

487
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,670
<21-18,Adams>使劲儿讨好他
<21-18,Adams>at the risk of a patient's life.

488
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,050
<21-19,House>他手术技术比较好
<21-19,House>He's the better surgeon.

489
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,890
<22-1,Chase>动脉夹
<22-1,Chase>Vascular clamp.

490
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:37,250
<22-2,Taub>你不准备给她做分流吗
<22-2,Taub>You're not gonna put her on bypass?

491
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:38,510
<22-3,Chase>那个要花半小时准备
<22-3,Chase>It'd take a half hour to set up.

492
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:40,020
<22-4,Adams>你现在上动脉夹  她会休克的
<22-4,Adams>You clamp now, she could stroke out.

493
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:42,350
<22-5,Chase>她已经有神经紊乱的症状了
<22-5,Chase>She's already got neurological symptoms.

494
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:44,380
<22-5,Chase>如果再等三十分钟  会出现大脑损伤的
<22-5,Chase>We wait 30 minutes, she'll definitely have brain damage.

495
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,820
<22-6,Adams>你这么做  她要么完全没事  要么就死亡
<22-6,Adams>You're trying to make sure she's either perfect or dead.

496
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:47,900
<22-7,Chase>她不会死的
<22-7,Chase>She's not going to die.

497
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,490
<22-7,Chase>如果我能五分钟内完成
<22-7,Chase>If I get this done in five minutes,

498
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:50,540
<22-7,Chase>她不会休克的
<22-7,Chase>she won't stroke out.

499
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:52,050
<22-8,Adams>你怎么知道是否来得及
<22-8,Adams>You don't know that you will.

500
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,590
<22-8,Adams>你无法保证因为
<22-8,Adams>And you can't know because you can't

501
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:55,090
<22-8,Adams>你对她感情用事了
<22-8,Adams>think clearly about her.

502
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,490
<22-9,Chase>动脉夹
<22-9,Chase>Vascular clamp.

503
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:09,510
<22-10,Chase>闭塞开始时间  九点四十六分二十三秒
<22-10,Chase>Occlusion time 9:46 and 23 seconds.

504
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:10,680
<22-10,Chase>血管剪
<22-10,Chase>Vascular scissors.

505
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:47,170
<22-11,Adams>已经超过五分钟了
<22-11,Adams>We're over five minutes.

506
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:51,430
<22-12,Chase>超声波探头
<22-12,Chase>Ultrasound.

507
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:00,870
<22-13,Chase>血流良好  减轻麻醉剂量
<22-13,Chase>Good flow. Lighten the anesthesia.

508
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:02,570
<22-14,Taub>你不先给她缝合吗
<22-14,Taub>You're not gonna close the wound first?

509
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:03,600
<22-15,Chase>不
<22-15,Chase>No.

510
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,590
<22-16,Chase>你能听见我说话吗
<22-16,Chase>Can you hear me?

511
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:25,130
<22-16,Chase>跟我说
<22-16,Chase>Repeat this,

512
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:28,100
<22-17,Moira>没有如果  而且  或可是
<22-17,Moira>no ifs, ands, or buts.

513
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,740
<22-17,Moira>没有如果  而且  或可是
<22-17,Moira>No ifs, ands, or buts.

514
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:40,800
<23-1,Park>我对之前的事很抱歉
<23-1,Park>I'm sorry about before.

515
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:44,500
<23-2,Chase>你害怕了  是不是
<23-2,Chase>You're scared, aren't you?

516
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,180
<23-2,Chase>所以你才想寻求别人陪伴
<23-2,Chase>That's why you wanted companionship.

517
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:49,630
<23-2,Chase>所以你在豪斯射击陶博的时候会尖叫
<23-2,Chase>That's why you cried out when House shot at Taub.

518
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,070
<23-2,Chase>你到底有什么好怕的
<23-2,Chase>What exactly are you scared of?

519
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,300
<23-2,Chase>怕被针刺
<23-2,Chase>A needle stick?

520
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,530
<23-2,Chase>还是怕又一个挥舞手术刀的神经病
<23-2,Chase>Some other nut pulling a scalpel?

521
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:58,800
<23-3,Park>我啥都怕
<23-3,Park>I'm scared of everything.

522
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,020
<23-4,Chase>发生了刀刺事件是很不幸
<23-4,Chase>It sucks that there was a stabbing.

523
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,790
<23-4,Chase>但是你会摆脱阴影的
<23-4,Chase>But you'll get over it.

524
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,290
<23-5,Park>你已经摆脱了吗
<23-5,Park>Like you have?

525
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:05,920
<23-6,Chase>你当时压根儿就不在场
<23-6,Chase>You weren't even there.

526
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:09,240
<23-7,Park>我知道  我离开了病房
<23-7,Park>I know, I, I left the room.

527
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:10,590
<23-7,Park>我运气好
<23-7,Park>It was pure luck.

528
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:13,180
<23-8,Chase>我当时在病房里  也算是种运气吧
<23-8,Chase>I was in the room. That was pure luck too.

529
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:19,730
<23-8,Chase>你既害怕又感到羞愧  我很理解
<23-8,Chase>I get that you're scared and guilty.

530
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:21,030
<23-8,Chase>但你是个医生
<23-8,Chase>You're still a doctor.

531
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:23,230
<23-8,Chase>我可没时间教你怎么当个医生
<23-8,Chase>I don't have time to teach you to act like one.

532
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:30,160
<23-9,Chase>我们切除了那段动脉
<23-9,Chase>We removed the artery.

533
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,470
<23-9,Chase>发现有结节
<23-9,Chase>I found nodules.

534
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:32,930
<23-10,House>可能是狼疮
<23-10,House>Could mean lupus.

535
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,100
<23-11,Chase>抗核抗体阴性
<23-11,Chase>Negative A.N.A.

536
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:36,240
<23-11,Chase>你上哪儿去
<23-11,Chase>Where are you going?

537
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:38,410
<23-12,House>假装给陶博分派
<23-12,House>Great thing about assigning Taub

538
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:40,580
<23-12,House>化验工作的好处就是
<23-12,House>fraudulent lab work is you know exactly

539
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:41,990
<23-12,House>能掌握他的动向
<23-12,House>where he's gonna end up.

540
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,070
<23-12,House>如果装得够假
<23-12,House>Great thing about assigning Taub

541
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:46,080
<23-12,House>我们就能欣赏到
<23-12,House>obviously fraudulent lab work

542
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:48,960
<23-12,House>他在工作中战战兢兢的表现
<23-12,House>is you get to watch his inner paranoiac at work.

543
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,180
<23-13,House>然后...
<23-13,House>And then...

544
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:01,000
<23-14,House>两枪爆头
<23-14,House>Two to the head.

545
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:03,150
<23-15,Chase>能谈谈我的病人吗
<23-15,Chase>Can we talk about my patient?

546
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:04,620
<23-16,House>你也真不容易
<23-16,House>Quite a journey.

547
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:06,550
<23-16,House>前段时间被人戳了心脏
<23-16,House>Starts with a surgical tool in your heart

548
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:08,530
<23-16,House>这两天换了你去戳人家小修女
<23-16,House>and ends with a surgeon's tool in a nun.

549
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:09,590
<23-16,House>你动什么脑筋
<23-16,House>What's the plan?

550
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:10,980
<23-17,Chase>我想要治好她
<23-17,Chase>Plan's to cure her.

551
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:14,210
<23-18,House>如果这不是毫无意义的滥情
<23-18,House>Well, if it's not meaningless sex,

552
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:15,930
<23-18,House>那么就是想从一而终
<23-18,House>kinda screams out for an end game.

553
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:18,370
<23-18,House>你就像是追着汽车跑的小狗
<23-18,House>You're the dog that's chasing the popemobile.

554
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,470
<23-18,House>你确定你想要...
<23-18,House>You sure you want...

555
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:22,830
<23-19,House>天啊
<23-19,House>Oh, my god.

556
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,690
<23-19,House>陶博在盘问清洁工
<23-19,House>Taub is interrogating the janitor.

557
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:29,950
<23-19,House>他一定认为我雇了清洁工来袭击他
<23-19,House>He must think that I hired him to attack...

558
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,550
<23-19,House>对啊  我怎么没想到
<23-19,House>Actually, why didn't I do that?

559
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:37,570
<23-19,House>血小板可能被误认为是结节
<23-19,House>Plaques could be confused for nodules.

560
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:40,870
<23-19,House>-那可能是...  -梅毒
<23-19,House>- Which would mean... - Syphilis.

561
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:43,350
<23-21,House>可以解释肩部和脚的症状
<23-21,House>Explains the shoulder and foot involvement.

562
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:44,950
<23-21,House>但愿你用的避孕套
<23-21,House>Hope you practiced

563
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,790
<23-21,House>天衣无缝
<23-21,House>the immaculate contraception.

564
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:52,840
<23-22,House>锁定上膛
<23-22,House>Lock and load.

565
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:56,950
<23-23,House>噗呀
<23-23,House>Boo-yah!

566
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:01,990
<23-25,Taub>噗呀你妹
<23-25,Taub>Boo-yah to you too.

567
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,660
<24-1,Moira>但我有几年没过性生活了
<24-1,Moira>But I hadn't had sex in years.

568
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,480
<24-2,Chase>你得的是三期梅毒  说明你患病
<24-2,Chase>Tertiary syphilis means you've had the disease

569
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,920
<24-2,Chase>很长时间了
<24-2,Chase>for at least that long.

570
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,300
<24-3,Moira>这么说你也染上了
<24-3,Moira>Does that mean you also have it?

571
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:15,690
<24-4,Chase>到了这个阶段可能没有传染性了
<24-4,Chase>Probably not contagious at this point.

572
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,920
<24-5,Moira>这病会导致幻觉吗
<24-5,Moira>Can it cause hallucinations?

573
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,970
<24-6,Chase>不太可能  怎么了
<24-6,Chase>It's unlikely. Why?

574
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:28,460
<24-7,Moira>我躺在手术台上的时候
<24-7,Moira>While I was on the operating table,

575
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,900
<24-7,Moira>那感觉不像是做梦
<24-7,Moira>it didn't feel like a dream.

576
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:35,680
<24-7,Moira>我看到那个我照顾过的男孩
<24-7,Moira>I saw the boy who I was caring for.

577
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,970
<24-7,Moira>就是那个车祸死掉的
<24-7,Moira>The one who died.

578
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:42,980
<24-7,Moira>他走到我跟前
<24-7,Moira>He walked right up to me.

579
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:45,320
<24-8,Chase>他对你说什么了
<24-8,Chase>What did he say?

580
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,590
<24-9,Moira>他握着我的手
<24-9,Moira>He just held my hand.

581
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:50,270
<24-9,Moira>好像宽恕我了
<24-9,Moira>It was like he forgave me.

582
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:54,330
<24-9,Moira>你觉得这事儿玄乎吧
<24-9,Moira>Do you think that's crazy?

583
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:58,470
<24-10,Chase>我认为你应该从中得到安慰
<24-10,Chase>I think it should give you solace,

584
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,980
<24-10,Chase>从这件事中走出来
<24-10,Chase>help you to move on.

585
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:10,540
<25-1,Foreman>你和你的病人上床了
<25-1,Foreman>You slept with your patient?

586
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:15,990
<25-1,Foreman>这个病例你别管了
<25-1,Foreman>You're off the case.

587
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:18,110
<25-2,Chase>是我让她免于大脑损伤
<25-2,Chase>I saved her from brain damage.

588
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:20,190
<25-2,Chase>你觉得我的判断受影响了吗
<25-2,Chase>You think my judgment's the least bit compromised?

589
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:21,730
<25-3,Foreman>她还在生病
<25-3,Foreman>She's still sick.

590
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,440
<25-3,Foreman>如果她死了  我们又会面临
<25-3,Foreman>If she dies, we'll be in the middle

591
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,080
<25-3,Foreman>新一轮的调查
<25-3,Foreman>of a brand-new investigation.

592
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,830
<25-4,Chase>你就关心你自己的位子
<25-4,Chase>This is about you covering your own ass.

593
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:29,240
<25-5,Foreman>我给过你时间  对你忍让
<25-5,Foreman>I gave you time, leeway,

594
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,570
<25-5,Foreman>而你就这么为所欲为
<25-5,Foreman>and you decided to do whatever the hell you wanted.

595
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:33,110
<25-6,Chase>豪斯置规则于不顾
<25-6,Chase>House can dance all over the rules,

596
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:35,270
<25-6,Chase>导致我被刺  你却对他网开一面
<25-6,Chase>gets me knifed, and he gets a pass.

597
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,290
<25-6,Chase>我才犯了一条错  没人因此受伤
<25-6,Chase>I break a rule, no one gets hurt,

598
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,300
<25-6,Chase>你却要把我调离
<25-6,Chase>but you kick me off my own case?

599
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:41,590
<25-7,Foreman>很不幸  确实如此
<25-7,Foreman>Unfortunately, yes.

600
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:47,700
<25-8,Adams>我很抱歉
<25-8,Adams>I'm sorry.

601
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:49,670
<25-9,Chase>是我为你挡了那刀
<25-9,Chase>I took that scalpel for you.

602
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:51,560
<25-10,Adams>所以我才这么做
<25-10,Adams>That's why I did this.

603
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:53,320
<25-10,Adams>三周之前的你
<25-10,Adams>Three weeks ago,

604
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,240
<25-10,Adams>绝不会和病人上床
<25-10,Adams>you never would have slept with a patient.

605
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,620
<25-10,Adams>之后也绝不会为她做手术
<25-10,Adams>And you never would have operated on her after.

606
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:00,810
<25-10,Adams>你需要帮助
<25-10,Adams>You need help.

607
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:02,740
<25-11,Chase>我需要离豪斯远点
<25-11,Chase>I need to get away from House

608
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:04,260
<25-11,Chase>离那些能让我回想起他的事物远点
<25-11,Chase>and everything that reminds me of him.

609
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,690
<25-12,Adams>你就是通过不顾他人劝告
<25-12,Adams>By breaking the rules,

610
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:07,970
<25-12,Adams>违反规则来做到吗
<25-12,Adams>not caring what anyone else thinks.

611
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:11,610
<25-12,Adams>你就是通过变得和豪斯一样来远离他吗
<25-12,Adams>You're gonna get away from him by turning into him?

612
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:19,950
<26-1,Moira>好疼啊
<26-1,Moira>It hurts.

613
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,580
<26-2,Adams>右上腹胀痛
<26-2,Adams>Right upper quadrant, pain and distension.

614
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,950
<26-3,Moira>我的胃怎么了
<26-3,Moira>What's wrong with my stomach?

615
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,510
<26-3,Moira>胃没事
<26-3,Moira>Nothing.

616
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:38,880
<26-4,Adams>是肝脏出问题
<26-4,Adams>This is your liver.

617
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:44,950
<26-4,Adams>肝衰竭可能由
<26-4,Adams>The liver failure could be

618
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,460
<27-1,Park>术中低血压诱发
<27-1,Park>from intraoperative hypotension.

619
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:48,550
<27-2,Chase>检查了麻醉表
<27-2,Chase>Checked the anesthesia sheet,

620
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:49,820
<27-2,Chase>血压一直正常
<27-2,Chase>pressure was fine throughout.

621
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:50,450
<27-2,Chase>是血栓吗
<27-2,Chase>Thrombus?

622
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:52,790
<27-3,House>这个回荡在大厅里
<27-3,House>That voice in the hall that none of us

623
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:54,160
<27-3,House>我们完全可以忽略的声音
<27-3,House>have any reason to be listening to

624
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:57,060
<27-3,House>倒还有些道理
<27-3,House>is not surprisingly wrong.

625
00:32:57,610 --> 00:32:59,110
<27-3,House>腹部B超未见异常
<27-3,House>Abdominal ultrasound was negative.

626
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,670
<27-4,Adams>只能认为肝脏衰竭
<27-4,Adams>Then we have to assume liver failure

627
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:03,550
<27-4,Adams>也只是她的症状之一
<27-4,Adams>is just another symptom of whatever she's got.

628
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:05,600
<27-5,Taub>特鲁索综合症
<27-5,Taub>Trousseau's syndrome could send clots,

629
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,500
<27-5,Taub>导致足部缺血
<27-5,Taub>cause the ischemic foot.

630
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:09,080
<27-5,Taub>加上淋巴结增大  巨红细胞症
<27-5,Taub>Add the enlarged lymph node, macrocytosis.

00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,020
<27-6,Park>播散型T细胞淋巴瘤
<27-6,Park>Disseminated T-cell lymphoma.

632
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:13,160
<27-7,Chase>威尔森说不是癌症
<27-7,Chase>Wilson said it wasn't cancer.

633
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,410
<27-8,House>威尔森说不是乳腺癌
<27-8,House>Wilson says it's not breast cancer.

634
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,020
<27-9,Chase>结节病
<27-9,Chase>Sarcoidosis.

635
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:19,050
<27-10,Adams>ACE水平正常
<27-10,Adams>Normal ACE level.

636
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:20,550
<27-11,Chase>与结节病没有必然关系
<27-11,Chase>Highly insensitive for sarcoid.

637
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:22,030
<27-12,Taub>胸透结果阴性
<27-12,Taub>Negative chest X-rays aren't.

638
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:23,280
<27-13,Chase>那么只能做活检了
<27-13,Chase>Then we've got to biopsy.

639
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,860
<27-14,House>是啊  福曼显然是错误的
<27-14,House>Yeah, Foreman's clearly wrong.

640
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:28,010
<27-14,House>你显然不是在抓救命稻草
<27-14,House>You're clearly not grasping at straws

641
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:30,810
<27-14,House>因为你显然没有掺杂进个人感情
<27-14,House>'cause you're clearly not emotionally involved.

642
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:33,810
<27-14,House>我知道你想要相信她患的是可治疾病
<27-14,House>I know you want to believe that this is something we can cure.

643
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:35,020
<27-14,House>可惜不是
<27-14,House>It's not.

644
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:36,940
<27-14,House>我很遗憾
<27-14,House>I'm sorry.

645
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,950
<28-1,Moira>多久才能知道是不是癌症
<28-1,Moira>How soon will they know if it's cancer?

646
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:52,490
<28-2,Chase>几小时内
<28-2,Chase>Within hours.

647
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:55,280
<28-3,Moira>如果是怎么办
<28-3,Moira>And if it is?

648
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,800
<28-4,Chase>总还可以化疗
<28-4,Chase>There's always chemo.

649
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:02,070
<28-5,Moira>你说的像是不会管用的样子
<28-5,Moira>You say that like it's not gonna work.

650
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:04,900
<28-6,Chase>可以延长你的生命
<28-6,Chase>Could extend your life.

651
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:06,430
<28-7,Moira>几年吗
<28-7,Moira>Years?

652
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:14,100
<28-8,Chase>只要你需要  我会一直陪在你身边
<28-8,Chase>I'll be here as much as you need.

653
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:20,940
<28-9,Moira>你还没告诉我你为什么离开修道院
<28-9,Moira>You still never told me why you left the seminary.

654
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:25,950
<28-10,Chase>玛莉·劳勒
<28-10,Chase>Mary Knoller.

655
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,270
<28-10,Chase>场地管理员的老婆
<28-10,Chase>Wife of the groundskeeper.

656
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,400
<28-10,Chase>被捉个正着  打了一耙子
<28-10,Chase>He caught me with her, got me with a rake.

657
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:35,730
<28-10,Chase>我屁股上的疤你可能注意到了
<28-10,Chase>Those scars on my ass you may have noticed.

658
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:40,110
<28-11,Moira>为什么之前不告诉我
<28-11,Moira>Why didn't you tell me that before?

659
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:41,700
<28-12,Chase>因为这原因太浅薄
<28-12,Chase>Because it was so shallow.

660
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,370
<28-12,Chase>我的离开并不是因为
<28-12,Chase>I wasn't exactly wrestling

661
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:45,850
<28-12,Chase>大是大非的斗争
<28-12,Chase>with great theological questions.

662
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:47,900
<28-13,Moira>我不相信
<28-13,Moira>I don't believe that.

663
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,250
<28-13,Moira>你内心一定在挣扎修道院是不是自己的归属
<28-13,Moira>You don't sleep with the groundskeeper's wife,

664
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:53,200
<28-13,Moira>否则不会和场地管理员的老婆上床
<28-13,Moira>wot unless you're struggling with whether you belong there.

665
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,280
<28-14,Chase>我一直想要相信
<28-14,Chase>I always wanted to believe.

666
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,390
<28-14,Chase>那样我的生活会轻松很多
<28-14,Chase>Would have made my life a lot easier.

667
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:05,060
<28-14,Chase>可最终还是没有
<28-14,Chase>It never took.

668
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:07,870
<28-15,Moira>也并不是...
<28-15,Moira>Doesn't...

669
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:09,740
<28-15,Moira>说...
<28-15,Moira>mean...

670
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,740
<28-15,Moira>来不及
<28-15,Moira>it's too late.

671
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:15,370
<28-16,Chase>你感到讲话困难吗  像之前那样
<28-16,Chase>Are you having trouble talking, like before?

672
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:18,910
<28-17,Moira>我能说得出话
<28-17,Moira>I can get the words out.

673
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:22,000
<28-17,Moira>可是感觉非常累
<28-17,Moira>Just feels heavy when I do.

674
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:22,940
<28-18,Chase>哪里累
<28-18,Chase>Where?

675
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:27,340
<28-19,Moira>咀嚼肌这里
<28-19,Moira>Wherever my chewing muscles are.

676
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:29,690
<28-20,Chase>我马上回来
<28-20,Chase>I'll be right back.

677
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:36,170
<29-1,Chase>豪斯还是偷袭到你了
<29-1,Chase>House finally got you.

678
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,060
<29-3,Chase>-他有千条妙计  我有...  -我有急事
<29-3,Chase>- He tried but-- - I gotta go.

679
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:40,660
<29-4,Taub>你在场就好了  堪称完美
<29-4,Taub>You shoulda seen it. It was perfect.

680
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:46,420
<29-5,Chase>她出现了颌跛行
<29-5,Chase>She has jaw claudication.

681
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:50,040
<29-5,Chase>只要颌跛行与颈动脉内膜剥脱同时出现
<29-5,Chase>If you only heard claudication and carotid dissection...

682
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:52,750
<29-6,House>就一定是巨细胞动脉炎
<29-6,House>I'd say giant cell arteritis.

683
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:55,400
<29-6,House>然后吩咐你的前同事们
<29-6,House>And I'd tell your former teammates

684
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,950
<29-6,House>给她用激素
<29-6,House>to put her on steroids.

685
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:58,840
<29-7,Chase>她可以活下来
<29-7,Chase>She's gonna live.

686
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:00,830
<29-7,Chase>没错
<29-7,Chase>Yeah.

687
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,770
<29-8,House>可是然后呢
<29-8,House>And then what?

688
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:11,190
<30-1,Moira>他们说我的肝功能有起色
<30-1,Moira>They say my liver function's better.

689
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,080
<30-1,Moira>我很快就可以出院了
<30-1,Moira>That I can get out of here soon.

690
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:14,800
<30-2,Chase>等你出院
<30-2,Chase>And when you do,

691
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:17,410
<30-2,Chase>我带你去波多黎各埃斯孔迪多
<30-2,Chase>I'm gonna take you to Puerto Escondido.

692
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:18,750
<30-3,Moira>墨西哥
<30-3,Moira>Mexico?

693
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:20,270
<30-4,Chase>墨西哥管浪
<30-4,Chase>The Mexican pipeline.

694
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:23,040
<30-4,Chase>五月初才是冲浪旺季  不过...
<30-4,Chase>Early May is when the surf really picks up but--

695
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:27,520
<30-4,Chase>怎么了
<30-4,Chase>What's wrong?

696
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:31,230
<30-5,Moira>我跟院长谈过了
<30-5,Moira>I spoke to the prioress.

697
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,230
<30-6,Chase>你要回修道院
<30-6,Chase>You're going back?

698
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:35,270
<30-7,Moira>我感受到了召唤
<30-7,Moira>I felt the calling.

699
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:37,730
<30-8,Chase>因为你看到那男孩
<30-8,Chase>When you saw the boy.

700
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:40,600
<30-9,Moira>我感到了神的爱  神的荣耀
<30-9,Moira>I felt god's love, his grace.

701
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:43,310
<30-9,Moira>我一生都在等待这一刻
<30-9,Moira>I've been waiting my entire life for that.

702
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,320
<30-10,Chase>那不是真的
<30-10,Chase>It's not real.

703
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:47,040
<30-11,Moira>我知道你濒死时没有任何感觉
<30-11,Moira>I know you didn't feel anything when you almost died.

704
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:47,810
<30-11,Moira>我有
<30-11,Moira>I did.

705
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:49,880
<30-12,Chase>你感到的是缺氧
<30-12,Chase>You felt oxygen depravation.

706
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:52,770
<30-12,Chase>你感到的是大脑分泌的去甲肾上腺素
<30-12,Chase>You felt your brain releasing noradrenaline.

707
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:54,390
<30-13,Moira>你之前没这样说
<30-13,Moira>You didn't say that before.

708
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,250
<30-14,Chase>我当时希望你能放下负担
<30-14,Chase>I wanted you to move on with your life.

709
00:36:57,710 --> 00:36:58,870
<30-14,Chase>我想赞同你
<30-14,Chase>I wanted to reassure you.

710
00:36:58,870 --> 00:37:00,960
<30-14,Chase>我想让你宽心
<30-14,Chase>I wanted you to feel better.

711
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:02,680
<30-15,Moira>你现在不想了吗
<30-15,Moira>And now you don't?

712
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:04,260
<30-15,Moira>现在
<30-15,Moira>Now...

713
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,490
<30-16,Chase>我想我爱上你了
<30-16,Chase>I think I love you.

714
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:21,800
<31-1,House>"去甲肾上腺素与濒死体验"
<31-1,House>"Noradrenaline and near-death experiences."

715
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,790
<31-1,House>我的天哪
<31-1,House>Oh, dear.

716
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:25,430
<31-1,House>你看到上帝了
<31-1,House>You saw god?

717
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:26,660
<31-2,Chase>是她看到了
<31-2,Chase>She did.

718
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:28,690
<31-2,Chase>她想回去修道院
<31-2,Chase>She wants to go back to the monastery.

719
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:32,120
<31-3,House>所以你正在准备一份报告材料
<31-3,House>So now you're preparing a powerpoint presentation

720
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,960
<31-3,House>让她留在人间与你共享凡俗之乐
<31-3,House>to keep her in your garden of earthly delights.

721
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,280
<31-5,House>你真是白痴
<31-5,House>You're an idiot.

722
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:39,430
<31-4,Chase>因为我找到了爱人
<31-4,Chase>Because I found someone I love?

723
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,030
<31-5,House>因为你是白痴
<31-5,House>Because you're an idiot.

724
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:43,370
<31-5,House>至少这一点上你俩很像
<31-5,House>At least you two have that in common.

725
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:46,090
<31-6,Chase>她的感受不过是种化学反应
<31-6,Chase>Her feelings are based on a chemical process.

726
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:47,300
<31-6,Chase>迟早会消退的
<31-6,Chase>They're gonna wear off.

727
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,850
<31-7,House>你刚和她上过床
<31-7,House>You just slept with her.

728
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,300
<31-7,House>大脑都被催产素占领了
<31-7,House>Your brain is exploding with oxytocin.

729
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,940
<31-7,House>你以为你的感情就经得起岁月考验
<31-7,House>You think that's gonna last through the ages?

730
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:53,960
<31-8,Chase>她在为盲目的信仰
<31-8,Chase>She's throwing away her life

731
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,200
<31-8,Chase>放弃自己的生活
<31-8,Chase>because of blind faith.

732
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,460
<31-8,Chase>你也一样
<31-8,Chase>So are you!

733
00:37:57,610 --> 00:37:58,690
<31-9,House>她找到了她想要的
<31-9,House>She's found something

734
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:00,550
<31-9,House>生活的中心和意义
<31-9,House>she wants to build her life around.

735
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:02,580
<31-9,House>全然的幻觉  可她显然
<31-9,House>It's a total illusion, but apparently she'll take

736
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,890
<31-9,House>会喜乐安宁毫不介意
<31-9,House>a little ignorance with her bliss.

737
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:05,440
<31-9,House>你要夺走这一切吗
<31-9,House>And you want to take that away?

738
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:06,920
<31-10,Chase>把事实真相强加于人
<31-10,Chase>How many times have you thrown the truth

739
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,160
<31-10,Chase>不是你最常做的事情吗
<31-10,Chase>in people's faces?

740
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:09,450
<31-11,House>我是为了事实真相
<31-11,House>Because it's the truth,

741
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:11,730
<31-11,House>不是为了和人家百年好合
<31-11,House>not because we're gonna live happily ever after.

742
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:16,040
<31-12,House>只有两种可能
<31-12,House>Either your relationship just blows up

743
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,320
<31-12,House>你俩像所有非童话浪漫一样告吹
<31-12,House>like every other non-magical romance,

744
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:19,920
<31-12,House>或者她留下来  一辈子都怨你
<31-12,House>or she stays with you but blames you

745
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,080
<31-12,House>毁掉了她生命的意义
<31-12,House>for stripping all the meaning out of her life.

746
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:24,680
<31-13,Chase>这与真相无关
<31-13,Chase>This has nothing to do with the truth.

747
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:28,040
<31-13,Chase>我在重整生活  而你不高兴
<31-13,Chase>You don't like that I'm reassessing my life,

748
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,630
<31-13,Chase>只要我愿意改变
<31-13,Chase>that I want to change it,

749
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:30,860
<31-13,Chase>我就可以做到
<31-13,Chase>that I can.

750
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:32,500
<31-14,House>谁都可以把自己的生活搞得一团糟
<31-14,House>Anyone can screw up a life.

751
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,940
<31-14,House>我可没说那是不可能的任务
<31-14,House>I never said that wasn't possible.

752
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:36,110
<31-15,Chase>你自己无法与人亲近
<31-15,Chase>You're incapable of human connection,

753
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:38,300
<31-15,Chase>想要所有人都像你
<31-15,Chase>so you want everyone to be like you.

754
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,810
<31-15,Chase>如果我想让你和我一样
<31-15,Chase>If I wanted you to be like me...

755
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:48,110
<31-16,House>我就该催促你
<31-16,House>I would be urging you

756
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:50,290
<31-16,House>做出这愚不可及的决定
<31-16,House>to make a stupid, stubborn decision

757
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:53,600
<31-16,House>毁掉你的一生  让你孤单痛苦
<31-16,House>that blows up your life and leaves you lonely and miserable.

758
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:02,890
<31-16,House>做了错事的人才需要重整人生
<31-16,House>You reassess your life when you've made mistakes.

759
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:06,030
<31-16,House>你没犯错  你只是被扎了一刀
<31-16,House>You didn't. You just got stabbed.

760
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:07,070
<32-1,Chase>别看书
<32-1,Chase>Don't look at the book.

761
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:09,940
<32-2,Park>我从驻院以来都没有做过颈静脉置管
<32-2,Park>I haven't done a jugular line since my residency.

762
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:12,840
<32-2,Park>我不想穿到颈动脉
<32-2,Park>I don't want to needle the carotid.

763
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:17,440
<32-3,Chase>第一步是什么
<32-3,Chase>What's the first step?

764
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:20,480
<32-4,Park>触诊胸锁乳突肌
<32-4,Park>Palpate the S.C.M.

765
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,410
<32-5,Chase>在哪里
<32-5,Chase>Where?

766
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:24,080
<32-6,Park>颈部的中三分之一
<32-6,Park>Middle third of the neck.

767
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,780
<33-1,Chase>能认识你我很高兴
<33-1,Chase>I'm happy I knew you.

768
00:40:58,680 --> 00:40:59,820
<33-2,Moira>我也一样
<33-2,Moira>So am I.

769
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:17,990
<33-3,Moira>罗伯特
<33-3,Moira>Robert.

770
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:16,980
<34-1,Foreman>24岁的水处理工人
<34-1,Foreman>24-year-old water treatment worker

771
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:19,460
<34-2,House>发热伴复视
<34-2,House>with pyrexia and double vision.

772
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:42,670
<34-3,Taub>脓肿
<34-3,Taub>Abscess?

773
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,720
<34-4,Adams>磁共振会有显示
<34-4,Adams>Would have seen it on the MRI.

774
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:47,410
<34-5,Chase>白喉所致眼肌瘫痪
<34-5,Chase>Diphtheria paralyzing the ocular muscles?

775
00:42:47,410 --> 00:42:48,980
<34-6,Park>不对  首先出现麻痹
<34-6,Park>No, paralysis was first.

776
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:51,170
<34-7,Taub>-动脉瘤  -不会伴发热
<34-7,Taub>- Aneurysm? - Not with this fever.

777
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:53,090
<34-7,Taub>或许是我们考虑的方向不对
<34-7,Taub>Maybe we're thinking about this the wrong way.
