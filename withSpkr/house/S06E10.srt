6
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,050
<3-17,House>-宝贝儿  -知道吗
<3-17,House>- Baby - You know,

7
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:38,050
<1-3,Wilson>大多数人去那是为了木屋和毛毯
<1-3,Wilson>Most people go for the hardwood or carpeting.

8
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:40,940
<1-3,Wilson>我觉得吉他和垃圾是一类玩意儿
<1-3,Wilson>I think guitars and garbage work just as well.

9
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,800
<1-4,House>昨晚突然起了兴致弹吉他
<1-4,House>Got the urge to play last night.

10
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:44,670
<1-4,House>他们都回来我的部门了
<1-4,House>Had to go all the way back to my apartment.

11
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,310
<1-4,House>看来我以后得悠着点了
<1-4,House>Thought I'd save on future trips.

12
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:49,120
<1-5,Wilson>你还真环保啊
<1-5,Wilson>Hmm. It's very eco-friendly of you.

13
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:52,240
<1-5,Wilson>来减排一下噪声污染怎样
<1-5,Wilson>How about keeping down on the noise pollution?

14
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,400
<1-6,House>6点33分  你该起床刷牙了
<1-6,House>6:33. You should be flossing by now.

15
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,650
<1-7,Wilson>我今天不上班
<1-7,Wilson>I'm not going to work today.

16
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,850
<1-7,Wilson>去打猎
<1-7,Wilson>I'm going hunting.

17
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:06,440
<1-7,Wilson>我睡着了再弹
<1-7,Wilson>After I sleep in.

18
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:19,620
<1-9,House>又到了一年的那个时间吗
<1-9,House>Is it that time of year again?

19
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,710
<1-9,House>他是个自负的混蛋
<1-9,House>He's a self-important jerk.

20
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,000
<1-10,Wilson>他是我的朋友
<1-10,Wilson>He's my friend.

21
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,290
<1-11,House>他是个自负的混蛋
<1-11,House>He's a self-important jerk.

22
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,770
<1-12,Wilson>貌似是我喜欢的白痴
<1-12,Wilson>Seems to be what I'm attracted to.

23
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:32,450
<1-13,House>这家伙叫你吉姆  他甚至不知道你姓甚名谁
<1-13,House>Guy calls you Jim. Doesn't even know your name.

24
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:34,720
<1-14,Wilson>吉姆是詹姆斯的昵称
<1-14,Wilson>Jim is short for James.

25
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:37,490
<1-14,Wilson>现在请出去  莱姆
<1-14,Wilson>Now go away, Lim.

26
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:44,860
<1-15,Tucker>打得好  吉姆
<1-15,Tucker>Nice shot, Jim.

27
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,430
<1-16,Wilson>还好  我瞄的是那棵树
<1-16,Wilson>Oh, yeah. I nailed that tree.

28
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,770
<1-16,Wilson>中午吃枫糖浆吧
<1-16,Wilson>Maple syrup for dinner.

29
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,020
<1-16,Wilson>我们应该带个导游来
<1-16,Wilson>We should have got a guide.

30
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,290
<1-17,Tucker>如果带人来指手画脚的
<1-17,Tucker>Oh, doesn't count as new adventure

31
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:55,260
<1-17,Tucker>就不算是真正意义上的探险了
<1-17,Tucker>If you have someone holding your hand.

32
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,300
<1-18,Wilson>另一方面  我们拿着武器
<1-18,Wilson>On the other hand, we are holding weapons

33
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,330
<1-18,Wilson>却不知道该干什么
<1-18,Wilson>And have no idea what we're doing.

34
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:01,970
<1-19,Tucker>-有意思  -我们得偷偷接近它们
<1-19,Tucker>- Fun. - Well, we need to sneak up on them.

35
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,330
<1-19,Tucker>我记得从哪看到过  印第安人说
<1-19,Tucker>I read somewhere that the native Americans say

36
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:06,010
<1-19,Tucker>火鸡知道你是怎么想的
<1-19,Tucker>Turkeys know what you're thinking.

37
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:08,130
<1-20,Wilson>那我还是别想德国黄段子了
<1-20,Wilson>So I should stop thinking about German porn.

38
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:09,870
<1-21,Tucker>不  不  那个会引得他们靠近些
<1-21,Tucker>No, no. That'll lure them closer.

39
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,580
<1-22,Tucker>咱俩还真不在行
<1-22,Tucker>We're terrible at this.

40
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:26,530
<1-23,Wilson>是啊  至少这里很冷  我的靴子还漏了
<1-23,Wilson>Yeah. Well, at least it's cold and my new boots leak.

41
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:27,640
<1-24,Tucker>时间差不多到了
<1-24,Tucker>Well, it's almost time anyway.

42
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,620
<1-24,Tucker>你带那袋子来了吗
<1-24,Tucker>Did you bring the bag?

43
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,060
<1-25,Tucker>3月30日  2004年
<1-25,Tucker>May 30, 2004.

44
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,650
<1-25,Tucker>上午10点7分
<1-25,Tucker>10:07 A.M.

45
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:49,740
<1-25,Tucker>威尔森医生通知我
<1-25,Tucker>Dr. Wilson informed me

46
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,270
<1-25,Tucker>如果治疗失败
<1-25,Tucker>That if treatment didn't go well,

47
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,710
<1-25,Tucker>我的白血病就只能让我再活6个月
<1-25,Tucker>My leukemia would give me only six more months to live.

48
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,670
<1-25,Tucker>11月30日  2004年
<1-25,Tucker>November 30, 2004.

49
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:58,030
<1-25,Tucker>6个月后  我还没死
<1-25,Tucker>Six months later, I didn't die.

50
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,050
<1-25,Tucker>只要我还活着
<1-25,Tucker>As long as I am alive,

51
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:02,660
<1-25,Tucker>我就要找到新鲜刺激的方式来感谢你
<1-25,Tucker>I will find new and exciting ways to thank you

52
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,010
<1-25,Tucker>给了我又一年的生命
<1-25,Tucker>For giving me another year.

53
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,270
<1-25,Tucker>到现在  又过去了很久  很久
<1-25,Tucker>Now move very, very far

54
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,000
<1-25,Tucker>以至于我可以确信
<1-25,Tucker>Away from there so that I can be sure

55
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,400
<1-25,Tucker>明年我还可以继续谢你

59
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,530
<1-29,Wilson>-搞什么  -天哪

<1-30,Tucker>对不起  我不知道怎么回事
<1-30,Tucker>Sorry. I don't know what happened.

61
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,350
<1-30,Tucker>我的胳膊动不了
<1-30,Tucker>I can't move my arm.

62
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:58,700
<1-30,Tucker>是中风吗
<1-30,Tucker>Am I having a stroke?

63
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:02,100
<1-31,Wilson>我不知道
<1-31,Wilson>I don't know.

64
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:45,050
<1-31,Wilson>好消息
<1-31,Wilson>Good news.

65
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:47,730
<2-1,Wilson>脑部CT未显示有中风症状
<2-1,Wilson>Head ct doesn't show any signs of a stroke.

66
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:49,240
<2-2,Ashley>所以他会没事的  是吗
<2-2,Ashley>So he's gonna be okay, right?

67
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,360
<2-3,Wilson>我真不敢相信你五年内
<2-3,Wilson>I cannot believe how much you've grown up

68
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,390
<2-3,Wilson>长这么大了
<2-3,Wilson>In five years.

69
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:54,290
<2-3,Wilson>她...
<2-3,Wilson>She's...

70
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:57,690
<2-3,Wilson>她不是艾米丽
<2-3,Wilson>She's not Emily.

71
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:59,150
<2-4,Tucker>阿什莉  我女友

00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:01,730
<2-4,Tucker>阿什莉  认识一下吉姆

74
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:02,920
<2-5,Wilson>很高兴认识你
<2-5,Wilson>It's good to meet you.

75
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,760
<2-6,Ashley>那这次他的胳膊
<2-6,Ashley>So this arm thing,

76
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,440
<2-6,Ashley>意味着他又要犯白血病吗
<2-6,Ashley>Does that mean his leukemia's back?

77
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:09,330
<2-7,Wilson>我检查过血球计数和红细胞形态
<2-7,Wilson>I checked blood counts and blood cell morphologies.

78
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:10,500
<2-7,Wilson>指标都正常
<2-7,Wilson>Everything is normal.

79
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,800
<2-8,Ashley>那么这些血液检查
<2-8,Ashley>So these blood tests,

80
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:13,960
<2-8,Ashley>都能肯定这不是癌症吗
<2-8,Ashley>It means it's not cancer for sure.

81
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,030
<2-9,Tucker>他说了我没事的
<2-9,Tucker>He said I'm fine.

82
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,460
<2-10,Ashley>那你觉得是什么
<2-10,Ashley>So what do you think it is?

83
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,220
<2-11,Wilson>应该是没什么的
<2-11,Wilson>Hopefully something innocuous.

84
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,620
<2-11,Wilson>我认识一个医生...
<2-11,Wilson>There's a doctor I can speak to who's great...

85
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:25,080
<2-11,Wilson>...对诊断病情非常在行
<2-11,Wilson>Who's great at diagnosing...

86
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,700
<2-12,Ashley>什么
<2-12,Ashley>What?

87
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:28,100
<2-13,Wilson>对不起  那个口疮
<2-13,Wilson>Sorry, that cold sore,

88
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,400
<2-13,Wilson>已经长了多久了
<2-13,Wilson>How long have you had that?

89
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,880
<2-14,Ashley>两周  非常抱歉
<2-14,Ashley>Um, two weeks. I'm sorry.

90
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,730
<2-14,Ashley>我接到电话很着急
<2-14,Ashley>I-I got the call.

91
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:33,260
<2-14,Ashley>没来得及遮瑕就来了
<2-14,Ashley>I didn't have time to cover it up.

92
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,380
<2-15,Tucker>那是什么  吉姆
<2-15,Tucker>What is it, Jim?

93
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:38,910
<2-16,Wilson>那种口疮是因某种病毒引起的
<2-16,Wilson>That cold sore is caused by a virus.

94
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:40,520
<2-16,Wilson>如果你们俩接吻
<2-16,Wilson>Assuming you guys kiss,

95
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,970
<2-16,Wilson>病毒会传染  感染到你的脊柱
<2-16,Wilson>The virus could transfer, infect your spine,

96
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:44,340
<2-16,Wilson>造成麻痹瘫痪
<2-16,Wilson>And cause the paralysis.

97
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,200
<2-16,Wilson>这种病成为横贯性脊髓炎
<2-16,Wilson>It's a disease called transverse myelitis.

98
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,970
<2-17,Tucker>这算好消息还是坏消息呢
<2-17,Tucker>And is that good news or bad news?

99
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:48,960
<2-18,Wilson>非常好的消息
<2-18,Wilson>It's great news.

100
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,470
<2-18,Wilson>我给你安排病房  开始阿昔洛韦治疗
<2-18,Wilson>I'll get you a room and start you on acyclovir.

<3-1,Wilson>How cool is that?

104
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:37,730
<3-1,Wilson>而且病人还很吃这一套 我之钟爱便在于此
<3-1,Wilson>Patients really eat that crap up. It's why I'm loved.

105
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,450
<3-2,House>-我在这干吗  -超声波清晰
<3-2,House>- What am I doing here? - Ultrasound is clear.

106
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:42,330
<3-4,House>意思是他肯定没怀孕  对吧
<3-4,House>Which means he's definitely not pregnant, right?

107
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:43,880
<3-12,Juan>额滴神哪  疼死俺咧

109
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,130
<3-5,Chase>可能是憩室炎
<3-5,Chase>Could be diverticulitis.

110
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:49,180
<3-5,Chase>你吃过籽类食品吗
<3-5,Chase>Have you eaten any seeds?

<3-9,House>Maybe I paid the redhead down in records a few bucks

120
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,810
<3-9,House>从你以往的表现来看
<3-9,House>To cc me on all your cases.

00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,130
<3-9,House>抽个血要这么久吗

<3-11,House>- Almost finished. - Well, when you're finished

126
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,630
<3-11,House>还不算完  检测一下
<3-11,House>Almost finishing it, test it.

127
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:23,350
<3-12,Juan>型男大主厨用上帝之手开膛破肚
<3-12,Juan>Mi estomago's ripped open by the hand of god.

128
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:24,520
<3-12,Juan>他在放我的血
<3-12,Juan>He spilled my blood.

129
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,320
<3-13,Thirteen>意识模糊  精神错乱
<3-13,Thirteen>Confusion. Delirium.

130
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,380
<3-14,House>为什么这么快把上帝之手排除掉
<3-14,House>Why rule out the hand of god so fast?

131
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,620
<3-15,House>你哥们白细胞数很少
<3-15,House>Your guy's low white count

132
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,830
<3-15,House>而且右臂瘫痪  说明
<3-15,House>And right arm paralysis equals a recurrence

133
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,430
<3-15,House>他的白血病复发了
<3-15,House>Of his leukemia.

134
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:35,770
<3-15,House>很简单
<3-15,House>Simple math.

135
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,230
<3-16,Wilson>你看过
<3-16,Wilson>Did you look past

136
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:40,150
<3-16,Wilson>这篇报告的第一页了吗
<3-16,Wilson>The first page of the file?

137
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,780
<3-16,Wilson>完全没发现白血病细胞
<3-16,Wilson>No aml cells anywhere.

138
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,130
<3-16,Wilson>我亲自做的血液检验
<3-16,Wilson>I did the blood smears myself.

139
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,280
<3-17,House>还是癌症
<3-17,House>It's still cancer.

140
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:46,390
<3-17,House>想知道我怎么知道的吗
<3-17,House>You know how I know?

141
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:48,220
<3-17,House>他咨询的是肿瘤专家  而不是普通医生
<3-17,House>He's got an oncologist for a doctor.

142
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,120
<3-18,Wilson>难道你神奇的白血病感应器
<3-18,Wilson>And your magical leukemia detector

143
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,880
<3-18,Wilson>比流动血细胞计数器还靠谱吗
<3-18,Wilson>Is more powerful than a flow cytometer?

144
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,300
<3-19,House>我寻找斑马是因为其他医生
<3-19,House>I look for zebras because other doctors

145
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,770
<3-19,House>已经排除了其他所有马类
<3-19,House>Rule out all the horses.

146
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:59,110
<3-19,House>也就是说你是那种医生
<3-19,House>In this case, you are those other doctors.

147
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:00,360
<3-19,House>所以得不出我的诊断结果
<3-19,House>You haven't earned a zebra.

148
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:03,340
<3-20,Wilson>-我赌100块  -你认真的吗
<3-20,Wilson>- 100 bucks. - Are you serious?

149
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:06,070
<3-21,House>没人愿意诊断出自己的朋友得癌症
<3-21,House>Look, friends don't diagnose friends with cancer.

150
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:06,980
<3-21,House>我能理解
<3-21,House>I get it.

151
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,850
<3-21,House>你没办法让自己客观
<3-21,House>Your problem is you're not objective.

152
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:11,290
<3-21,House>你的关心影响了诊断
<3-21,House>Your caring is clouding your diagnosis.

153
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,190
<3-21,House>抛除主观感情
<3-21,House>Just cut that out

154
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,820
<3-21,House>你会是一个好医生的
<3-21,House>And you could be a pretty decent doctor.

155
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:17,090
<3-22,House>告诉我乳酸水平
<3-22,House>Just give me the lactic acid level.

156
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:18,020
<3-23,Thirteen>27
<3-23,Thirteen>27.

157
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,860
<3-24,House>就算你不说英语
<3-24,House>The fact that you can't speak English

158
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,950
<3-24,House>你也会对我要说的
<3-24,House>Is not an excuse for you not being humiliated

159
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,320
<3-24,House>感到丢脸
<3-24,House>By what I'm about to say.

160
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,220
<3-24,House>这也不能成为
<3-24,House>It's also not an excuse for you not telling us

161
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,850
<3-24,House>你癖好网球的借口
<3-24,House>That you were a tennis pro.

162
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:29,600
<3-24,House>你要是说了我们也就不用浪费时间了
<3-24,House>If you had, we wouldn't have wasted our time.

164
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,750
<4-1,Wilson>塔克安顿好了吗
<4-1,Wilson>Is Tucker settling in?

165
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,280
<4-2,Sandy>好了  已经服用了一剂量的阿昔洛韦
<4-2,Sandy>Yeah. Already got his first dose of acyclovir.

166
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:40,910
<4-2,Sandy>不用担心
<4-2,Sandy>And don't worry,

167
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:42,750
<4-2,Sandy>我为他女朋友订了儿童餐
<4-2,Sandy>I ordered his girlfriend the kiddy meal.

168
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,860
<4-3,Wilson>去看下一个病人
<4-3,Wilson>Next patient on deck.

169
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,660
<4-4,Sandy>戴尔·克林顿  化疗第六天
<4-4,Sandy>Del Clinton. Day six of chemo.

170
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,120
<4-4,Sandy>他外孙们刚走
<4-4,Sandy>You just missed the grandkids.

171
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,110
<4-5,Wilson>没关系
<4-5,Wilson>Oh, that's all right.

172
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:52,670
<4-5,Wilson>上次他们来把我的领带都画花了
<4-5,Wilson>Last time they were here, they painted my tie.

173
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,760
<4-6,Wilson>你差不多可以回家了
<4-6,Wilson>You're almost ready to go home.

174
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,110
<4-6,Wilson>感觉还好吧
<4-6,Wilson>You feeling okay?

175
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,830
<4-7,Del>感觉像跑了四圈
<4-7,Del>I feel like I felt after the last four rounds.

176
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:05,710
<4-8,Wilson>肿瘤疼痛没有加重表示一切都好
<4-8,Wilson>In oncology, familiar pain means all is well.

177
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,540
<4-9,Del>所以没问题是吗
<4-9,Del>So that's good, right?

178
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:08,350
<4-9,Del>对
<4-9,Del>Yeah.

179
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,690
<4-10,Wilson>我听说杰西和兹克来看你了
<4-10,Wilson>I heard Jesse and Zeke were by earlier.

180
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:11,490
<4-11,Del>是啊
<4-11,Del>Yeah.

181
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:14,780
<4-12,Wilson>对不起  戴尔  我该走了
<4-12,Wilson>Sorry, Del, I gotta run.

182
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:21,240
<4-13,Wilson>他们怎么样
<4-13,Wilson>How are they doing?

183
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,240
<4-14,Del>他们很好
<4-14,Del>They...they're fine.

184
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,890
<4-15,Wilson>没有游戏破记录  成绩第一
<4-15,Wilson>No game-winning hits? No aced report cards?

185
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:27,880
<4-15,Wilson>参加校园剧之类的吗
<4-15,Wilson>No school plays?

186
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,970
<4-16,Del>我想没有
<4-16,Del>I guess not.

187
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:32,020
<4-16,Del>你该走了
<4-16,Del>I thought you had to go.

188
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,110
<4-17,Wilson>你觉得不开心吗
<4-17,Wilson>Are you depressed?

189
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,570
<4-18,Del>我得了癌症啊
<4-18,Del>I have cancer.

190
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,910
<4-19,Wilson>你早就得癌症了
<4-19,Wilson>You've had cancer for a long time.

191
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,250
<4-19,Wilson>但从来没影响过你吹嘘
<4-19,Wilson>It's never stopped you from bragging

192
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,420
<4-19,Wilson>你的外孙们
<4-19,Wilson>About the grandkids.

193
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:48,180
<4-20,Del>可能情绪比平时低落一些吧
<4-20,Del>I guess I'm feeling a little more down than usual.

194
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,700
<4-20,Del>意味着什么吗
<4-20,Del>Can you give me something?

195
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:52,520
<4-21,Wilson>是的  我本不想让你感到紧张
<4-21,Wilson>Yeah. I don't want you to get alarmed,

196
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,760
<4-21,Wilson>但是沮丧可能是
<4-21,Wilson>But sometimes depression can be a sign

197
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,040
<4-21,Wilson>并发症之类引起
<4-21,Wilson>That something else is going on.

198
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,480
<4-21,Wilson>我现在就去给你多安排几个测试
<4-21,Wilson>I'm just gonna order a couple of extra tests.

199
00:09:58,930 --> 00:09:59,740
<4-22,Wilson>好吧
<4-22,Wilson>Okay?

200
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:07,990
<4-23,Ashley>-怎么了  -他的脚
<4-23,Ashley>- What's going on? - It's his foot now.

201
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:11,550
<4-25,Ashley>-没事  -有事
<4-25,Ashley>- It's nothing. - It's not nothing.

202
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:13,820
<4-26,Tucker>我的脚开始感到
<4-26,Tucker>I just started getting a little tingling feeling

203
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:14,790
<4-26,Tucker>有一点点刺痛
<4-26,Tucker>In my foot.

204
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:16,980
<4-27,Ashley>严重吗
<4-27,Ashley>Is that bad?

205
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,260
<4-28,Tucker>阿什利  没事的
<4-28,Tucker>Ashley, it's gonna be okay.

206
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:20,040
<4-29,Wilson>可能是脚麻木了
<4-29,Wilson>It might mean his foot fell asleep.

207
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,260
<4-29,Wilson>也可能没事
<4-29,Wilson>It might mean nothing.

208
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,550
<4-29,Wilson>可以让我们单独谈谈吗
<4-29,Wilson>Could you give us a few minutes?

209
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:24,480
<4-30,Ashley>什么  为什么不能跟我说
<4-30,Ashley>What...why can't you tell me?

210
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,260
<4-31,Tucker>因为你把他弄紧张了
<4-31,Tucker>Because you're making him nervous.

211
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,110
<4-31,Tucker>就一会儿好吗  亲爱的
<4-31,Tucker>Just give us a few minutes, okay, hon?

212
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:32,500
<4-32,Tucker>跟你之前的诊断结果不一样
<4-32,Tucker>Does this mean that it's not the disease

213
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,470
<4-32,Tucker>对不对
<4-32,Tucker>You thought it was?

214
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:35,640
<4-33,Wilson>我之前给你的药没有起作用
<4-33,Wilson>It means the medicine I gave you is not working.

215
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,540
<4-33,Wilson>可能要加强力度
<4-33,Wilson>I just might have to hit it harder.

216
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:39,990
<4-33,Wilson>我打算给你的治疗中加入三氮唑核苷
<4-33,Wilson>I'm going to add ribavirin to your treatment.

217
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:41,490
<4-33,Wilson>吉姆
<4-33,Wilson>Jim.

218
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,770
<4-34,Tucker>你确定这次不是复发
<4-34,Tucker>Are you sure that this isn't a recurrence?

219
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:47,560
<4-35,Wilson>原来你只是在阿什利面前扮坚强啊
<4-35,Wilson>So the brave face is just for Ashley.

220
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,500
<4-36,Tucker>她还年轻  胆子小
<4-36,Tucker>She's young. She's terrified.

221
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,520
<4-36,Tucker>-她没有心理准备  -不用担心
<4-36,Tucker>- She's not really equipped. - Don't worry.

222
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,270
<4-37,Wilson>如果你得了癌症
<4-37,Wilson>Once you've had cancer,

223
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:56,880
<4-37,Wilson>你最担心的就是复发  我明白了
<4-37,Wilson>Recurrence is your biggest fear. I get it.

224
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,390
<4-37,Wilson>我已经全面检查过了
<4-37,Wilson>I've looked at this thing every which way there is.

225
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:00,880
<4-37,Wilson>没有这回事
<4-37,Wilson>That's not what's happening here.

226
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,040
<4-38,Tucker>你能给我女儿打个电话让她过来吗
<4-38,Tucker>Can you call my daughter and ask her to come down?

227
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:05,850
<4-39,Wilson>你为什么不自己打呢
<4-39,Wilson>You can't do it?

228
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:08,410
<4-40,Tucker>我和阿什利在一起之后
<4-40,Tucker>She hasn't exactly been talking to me

229
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:10,280
<4-40,Tucker>她就没怎么和我说过话了
<4-40,Tucker>Since I got together with Ashley.

230
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,540
<4-40,Tucker>我很想她来
<4-40,Tucker>I'd really like her to be here.

231
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,770
<4-41,Wilson>可以
<4-41,Wilson>Of course.

232
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,200
<5-1,Wilson>你要看他病的有多严重
<5-1,Wilson>Exactly how serious does it have to be

233
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,440
<5-1,Wilson>再决定要不要来看他妈
<5-1,Wilson>To justify you coming to see your father?

234
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:24,970
<5-1,Wilson>不  对不起
<5-1,Wilson>No. I'm sorry.

235
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:27,210
<5-1,Wilson>我只是宁愿你后悔来了
<5-1,Wilson>I just... I'd rather you regretted coming

236
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:28,830
<5-1,Wilson>也不要后悔没来
<5-1,Wilson>Than regretted not coming.

237
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,450
<5-1,Wilson>谢谢你  艾米丽
<5-1,Wilson>Thanks, Emily.

238
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,870
<5-2,Cuddy>塔克怎么样
<5-2,Cuddy>How's Tucker?

239
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:37,930
<5-3,Wilson>他的私生活一团糟
<5-3,Wilson>Oh, well, he's made a mess of his personal life.

240
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,700
<5-3,Wilson>但身体没事  很快就会好了
<5-3,Wilson>But physically, I think he's gonna be fine.

241
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,280
<5-3,Wilson>横贯性脊髓炎
<5-3,Wilson>Transverse myelitis.

242
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,990
<5-4,Cuddy>豪斯怎么说
<5-4,Cuddy>What does House think?

243
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,760
<5-5,Wilson>怎么了
<5-5,Wilson>What is this?

244
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,330
<5-5,Wilson>豪斯是我的监工吗
<5-5,Wilson>Is House my overseer now?

245
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,690
<5-6,Cuddy>医生医治自己的朋友
<5-6,Cuddy>No, it's just not always a good idea

246
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:50,920
<5-6,Cuddy>始终不是个好主意  仅此而已
<5-6,Cuddy>For doctors to treat Their friends, that's all.

247
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,310
<5-7,Wilson>豪斯赌100块他得的是癌症
<5-7,Wilson>Well, House has got 100 bucks on cancer.

248
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:55,450
<5-7,Wilson>所以除非你想加入
<5-7,Wilson>So unless you want in on the action...

249
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:58,000
<5-8,Cuddy>邦妮还在做房产经纪吗
<5-8,Cuddy>Um, is Bonnie still a realtor?

250
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,590
<5-9,Wilson>据我所知还是
<5-9,Wilson>As far as I know.

251
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:01,240
<5-10,Cuddy>你介意我打电话给她吗
<5-10,Cuddy>Do you mind if I call her?

252
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,220
<5-10,Cuddy>我正在找新的地方住
<5-10,Cuddy>I'm, uh, looking for a new place.

253
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,810
<5-10,Cuddy>我要和卢卡斯搬到一起了
<5-10,Cuddy>I'm moving in with Lucas.

254
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:09,820
<5-11,Taub>不是网球
<5-11,Taub>It wasn't the tennis.

255
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:13,190
<5-12,Wilson>你要搬去和卢卡斯一起住
<5-12,Wilson>You're moving in with Lucas?

256
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,050
<5-13,Cuddy>是的
<5-13,Cuddy>Yes.

257
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,400
<5-14,Wilson>你和邦妮是朋友
<5-14,Wilson>You're Bonnie's friend.

258
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,700
<5-14,Wilson>你知道怎么联系她
<5-14,Wilson>You know how to reach her.

259
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,810
<5-14,Wilson>你不直接找她
<5-14,Wilson>And yet instead of calling her,

260
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:21,850
<5-14,Wilson>反而来要我许可
<5-14,Wilson>You come and seek my permission.

261
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,030
<5-14,Wilson>是希望得到我的祝福
<5-14,Wilson>You want my blessing,

262
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:25,200
<5-14,Wilson>换句话说是豪斯的祝福
<5-14,Wilson>And implicitly, House's blessing.

263
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,870
<5-15,Cuddy>我不需要豪斯的祝福
<5-15,Cuddy>I don't need House's blessing.

264
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:28,390
<5-16,Wilson>很好
<5-16,Wilson>Good.

265
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:37,740
<6-1,Ashley>他的胳膊什么时候可以再动
<6-1,Ashley>So when will he be able to move his arm again?

266
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,030
<6-2,Wilson>很快
<6-2,Wilson>Should be soon.

267
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:41,160
<6-3,Wilson>又开始抽烟了吗
<6-3,Wilson>Started smoking again?

268
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:41,950
<6-4,Tucker>没有
<6-4,Tucker>No.

269
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:45,310
<6-5,Ashley>是么意思  咳嗽表示很严重吗
<6-5,Ashley>What... what does that mean? Is it bad that he's coughing?

270
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,540
<6-6,Emily>爸爸
<6-6,Emily>Hi, Dad.

271
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,990
<6-7,Melissa>梅丽莎
<6-7,Melissa>Melissa

272
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,540
<6-8,Tucker>我不知道你会来
<6-8,Tucker>I didn't know you were coming.

273
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,970
<6-9,Emily>威尔森医生打电话的时候
<6-9,Emily>I was at mom's house

274
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,310
<6-9,Emily>我在妈妈那儿
<6-9,Emily>When doctor Wilson called.

275
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:54,810
<6-10,Melissa>如果觉得不舒服我可以离开
<6-10,Melissa>I can go if it's gonna be weird.

276
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,240
<6-11,Tucker>不  不  不要走  没事儿
<6-11,Tucker>No, no. Stay. It's fine.

277
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,580
<6-13,Wilson>最近好吗
<6-13,Wilson>How are you?

278
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,550
<6-14,Melissa>他没事吧
<6-14,Melissa>Is he okay?

279
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:01,910
<6-15,Wilson>没事的
<6-15,Wilson>Yeah. He's okay.

280
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,580
<6-15,Wilson>虽然我觉得咳嗽没关系
<6-15,Wilson>I'm not a big fan of this coughing though.

281
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:06,100
<6-16,Melissa>你就是阿什利吧
<6-16,Melissa>You must be Ashley.

282
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:06,890
<6-16,Melissa>你好
<6-16,Melissa>Hi.

283
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,130
<6-17,Ashley>你没事吧
<6-17,Ashley>Hey, are you okay?

284
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:13,530
<6-18,Ashley>是不是口疮引起的
<6-18,Ashley>Do you think this cold sore thing could've caused this?

285
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,380
<6-19,Wilson>不  无论什么
<6-19,Wilson>No. Whatever's causing this

286
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,900
<6-19,Wilson>都不止影响了他的神经
<6-19,Wilson>Is affecting more than his nerves.

287
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,310
<6-19,Wilson>这儿需要急救车
<6-19,Wilson>I need a crash cart in here!

288
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:32,400
<7-1,Wilson>你们是不是有个垂死的墨西哥低吟歌手
<7-1,Wilson>Don't you guys have a dying mexican crooner

289
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,960
<7-1,Wilson>-要去治疗吗  -他已经好了
<7-1,Wilson>- To attend to? - He isn't dying anymore.

290
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,040
<7-2,Foreman>我们发现他有狂吃爆米花的习惯
<7-2,Foreman>Found out he was on a popcorn diet.

291
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,520
<7-2,Foreman>一天吃十袋微波炉爆米花
<7-2,Foreman>Eating ten bags of microwave popcorn a day.

292
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:40,140
<7-2,Foreman>膨胀的烟气损伤了他的肺
<7-2,Foreman>Huffing the fumes scared his lungs.

293
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:44,630
<7-3,Wilson>哇  那  真是很奇怪
<7-3,Wilson>Wow, that's... very strange.

294
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:45,900
<7-3,Wilson>豪斯哪儿去了
<7-3,Wilson>Where's House?

295
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,000
<7-4,Taub>正在表演他例行的"躲开卡迪
<7-4,Taub>Performing his ritual "hiding from Cuddy

296
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,790
<7-4,Taub>以免接到新的病人"的舞蹈
<7-4,Taub>To avoid getting a new case" dance.

297
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:52,460
<7-4,Taub>这是一种爵士风情的舞蹈
<7-4,Taub>It's sort of a jazz-fusion type of thing.

298
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,890
<7-5,Thirteen>他也许在停尸间吃午饭吧
<7-5,Thirteen>He's probably eating lunch in the morgue.

299
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:56,590
<7-5,Thirteen>-如果你着急找他我可以传呼他  -事实上
<7-5,Thirteen>- I can page him to your office if you want. - Atually...

300
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:59,010
<7-6,Wilson>也许我单独跟你们谈谈会更好些
<7-6,Wilson>Maybe it would be better if I talked to you guys alone.

301
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,680
<7-6,Wilson>豪斯和我正在为一个病人打赌
<7-6,Wilson>House and I have a bet about one of my patients.

302
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:04,250
<7-6,Wilson>你们想让他输100块钱吗
<7-6,Wilson>You guys mind making him 100 bucks poorer?

303
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:09,330
<7-7,Wilson>一个43岁的男人  白血病刚刚得到复原
<7-7,Wilson>43-year-old male in remission from leukemia

304
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:11,890
<7-7,Wilson>现在左臂失去知觉  呼吸困难
<7-7,Wilson>Presents with left arm paralysis and trouble breathing.

305
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:13,680
<7-8,Chase>我猜豪斯一定赌他的癌症复发了
<7-8,Chase>I assume House's money is on cancer.

306
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,110
<7-9,Wilson>谢谢  这很有用
<7-9,Wilson>Thanks. That's very helpful.

307
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,810
<7-10,Taub>硬膜下的血肿能够解释...
<7-10,Taub>Subdural hematoma would explain--

308
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:17,810
<7-11,Wilson>CT已经把这种可能排除了
<7-11,Wilson>Ct ruled it out.

309
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:20,000
<7-11,Wilson>我曾以为是横贯性脊髓炎病毒感染 所以给他用了抗病毒药
<7-11,Wilson>I thought it was tm so I started him on antivirals,

310
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,850
<7-11,Wilson>可是他病情更严重了
<7-11,Wilson>But he got worse.

311
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:22,090
<7-12,Foreman>是细菌感染吗
<7-12,Foreman>Bacterial infection?

312
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:23,740
<7-13,Wilson>细菌传染应该感染得更快些
<7-13,Wilson>Bacteria would move much faster than this.

313
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:24,660
<7-13,Wilson>那他现在就应该死了
<7-13,Wilson>He'd be dead already.

314
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,730
<7-14,Thirteen>是不是真菌呢
<7-14,Thirteen>Could be fungal.

315
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:27,530
<7-15,Taub>真菌感染能解释他的呼吸问题
<7-15,Taub>Fungal infection would explain his breathing problem,

316
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:30,100
<7-15,Taub>可是解释不了"胳膊动不了"的问题
<7-15,Taub>But not his "unable to move his arm" problem.

317
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:34,170
<7-16,Wilson>事实上  如果是曲霉菌类真菌
<7-16,Wilson>Actually, if aspergillus fungus balls

318
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:37,180
<7-16,Wilson>在他的肺上生根然后扩散到脊柱
<7-16,Wilson>Took root in his lungs and spread to his spine,

319
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,200
<7-16,Wilson>那就可以解释他这两个症状了
<7-16,Wilson>It would explain both.

320
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:41,420
<7-16,Wilson>谢谢了
<7-16,Wilson>Thanks.

321
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:47,160
<8-1,Wilson>治疗过程包括在感染位置穿刺
<8-1,Wilson>The treatment involves riddling the infected area

322
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,030
<8-1,Wilson>附以有抗真菌药物的小药丸
<8-1,Wilson>With bb-sized pellets of antifungal meds.

323
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:52,530
<8-2,Tucker>我想你该不会是装上点12的子弹
<8-2,Tucker>I assume you don't just load up the 12-gauge

324
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:54,420
<8-2,Tucker>然后在我身上乱打一通吧
<8-2,Tucker>And pepper me with birdshot.

325
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:57,270
<8-3,Wilson>不  我们会用更仁慈的方法
<8-3,Wilson>No. We have a slightly more humane delivery system.

326
00:14:57,270 --> 00:15:00,220
<8-3,Wilson>但是我们确实要把你的身体打开
<8-3,Wilson>But we do have to open you up.

328
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:04,270
<8-3,Wilson>也会有风险
<8-3,Wilson>There are risks.

329
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:05,570
<8-4,Tucker>你怎么想  亲爱的
<8-4,Tucker>What do you think, honey?

330
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:08,310
<8-4,Tucker>我...我不知道
<8-4,Tucker>I-I don't know.

331
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:10,680
<8-5,Ashley>我是说  手术是最好的治疗方案吗
<8-5,Ashley>I mean, is surgery really such a good idea?

332
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,390
<8-5,Ashley>他身体状况很差
<8-5,Ashley>He just seems so sick.

333
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:13,380
<8-5,Ashley>我只是...
<8-5,Ashley>I just--

334
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,700
<8-5,Ashley>你们应该采取最稳妥的办法
<8-5,Ashley>You should do whatever you think is best.

335
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,370
<8-6,Melissa>这是唯一治他病的办法吗
<8-6,Melissa>Is this the only way to go after this thing?

336
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:21,410
<8-7,Wilson>因为他病情恶化很快
<8-7,Wilson>Because of the rapid progression,

337
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:23,710
<8-7,Wilson>我觉得我们没有时间去试其他的办法
<8-7,Wilson>I don't think we have time to test or try ivs.

338
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,430
<8-8,Melissa>他的身体状况可以承受麻醉吗
<8-8,Melissa>And he's strong enough to endure anesthesia.

339
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:26,370
<8-9,Wilson>可以
<8-9,Wilson>Definitely.

340
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:28,160
<8-10,Melissa>我希望你能在手术现场
<8-10,Melissa>I want you there during the surgery.

341
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,030
<8-11,Wilson>当然
<8-11,Wilson>Of course.

342
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:32,660
<8-12,Melissa>那就做手术吧
<8-12,Melissa>You gotta do it.

343
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,680
<8-13,Wilson>那好  奇斯医生一会儿过来
<8-13,Wilson>Good. Dr. Chase will be in here soon

344
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,920
<8-13,Wilson>把你推到手术室去
<8-13,Wilson>To get you set for the O.R.

345
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:43,590
<9-1,Wilson>呼叫一下奇斯医生到塔克房间做手术准备
<9-1,Wilson>Page Dr. Chase to Tucker's room for a surgery consult.

346
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:44,290
<9-1,Wilson>你能不能给我--
<9-1,Wilson>And can you get me--

347
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:46,370
<9-2,Sandy>卡普维茨先生想跟您谈谈
<9-2,Sandy>Uh, Mr. Koplovitz wants to talk to you.

348
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:47,620
<9-3,Wilson>出了什么事吗
<9-3,Wilson>Is everything all right?

349
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,890
<9-4,Sandy>他想跟他的医生谈
<9-4,Sandy>He wanted to talk to his doctor,

350
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:50,770
<9-4,Sandy>而不是跟他医生的助手谈
<9-4,Sandy>Not his doctor's assistant.

351
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:52,660
<9-4,Sandy>还有  豪斯在找你呢
<9-4,Sandy>Oh, and House is looking for you.

352
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,360
<9-5,Wilson>-你怎么跟他说的  -我说你在门诊部
<9-5,Wilson>- What did you tell him?  - That you were in the clinic.

353
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,010
<9-6,Sandy>我想你有十分钟就够了
<9-6,Sandy>I figure that gives you about ten minutes.

354
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,870
<9-6,Sandy>这是卡普维茨先生的病历  快去吧
<9-6,Sandy>Here. Mr. Koplovitz's chart. Go.

355
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,420
<9-7,Wilson>你好  索尔
<9-7,Wilson>Hello, Saul.

356
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,070
<9-7,Wilson>我听说你找我
<9-7,Wilson>I heard you were looking for me.

357
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,310
<9-8,Saul>我感觉很累
<9-8,Saul>I'm very tired.

358
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:09,060
<9-8,Saul>可我却睡不着
<9-8,Saul>But I can't sleep.

359
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,770
<9-9,Wilson>今天是你的幸运日
<9-9,Wilson>Today's your lucky day.

360
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:13,080
<9-9,Wilson>刚好我是睡眠专家
<9-9,Wilson>I happen to be a sleep specialist.

361
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,100
<9-10,Saul>谢谢你  医生
<9-10,Saul>Thanks, doc.

362
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:32,160
<9-11,House>嗨  你这家伙能给我点私人空间吗
<9-11,House>Hey. Can a guy get a little privacy?

363
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,260
<9-12,Wilson>真是个不错的藏身之处啊
<9-12,Wilson>Nice hiding spot.

364
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:34,660
<9-13,House>事实上  这儿很完美
<9-13,House>Actually, it's perfect.

365
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,380
<9-13,House>它让我躲开了卡迪又找到了你
<9-13,House>It allows me to hide from Cuddy and find you.

366
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:38,980
<9-13,House>她想要怎样
<9-13,House>What did she want?

367
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:41,860
<9-14,Wilson>多亏你  她刚刚给塔克做了检查
<9-14,Wilson>She was checking up on Tucker thanks to you.

368
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,080
<9-15,House>就这样吗
<9-15,House>That's it?

369
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:46,340
<9-16,Wilson>你想知道什么  关于你吗
<9-16,Wilson>Like what? Something about you?

370
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,950
<9-16,Wilson>关于怎么说起你吗
<9-16,Wilson>Something you could interpret as being about you?

371
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,240
<9-16,Wilson>也许是个变位词
<9-16,Wilson>An anagram maybe?

372
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,340
<9-16,Wilson>如果你能找到另一个藏身之处就真是太好了
<9-16,Wilson>It'd be great if you could play hide and seek somewhere else.

373
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,350
<9-17,House>-我的病人要--  -没问题
<9-17,House>- My patient just--  - No problem.

374
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:55,560
<9-17,House>给我你欠我的100块钱你就可以走了
<9-17,House>Just give me the 100 bucks you owe me and I'm gone.

375
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:57,570
<9-18,Wilson>塔克不是癌症复发
<9-18,Wilson>Tucker doesn't have cancer.

376
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,310
<9-19,House>他也不是
<9-19,House>He doesn't have a ball of fungus

377
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:00,460
<9-19,House>肺内真菌感染
<9-19,House>In his lungs either.

378
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,650
<9-19,House>下次你用我的团队的时候
<9-19,House>Next time you want to use my team,

379
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,360
<9-19,House>我建议你要给小费
<9-19,House>I suggest you at least leave a tip.

380
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,630
<9-20,Wilson>我手术要迟到了
<9-20,Wilson>I'm late for surgery.

381
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,940
<9-21,Cuddy>你的助手说你在这儿
<9-21,Cuddy>Ah, your assistant said you'd be in here.

382
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:08,910
<9-21,Cuddy>我和邦妮谈了
<9-21,Cuddy>I talked to Bonnie.

383
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:10,020
<9-22,Wilson>我们出去说
<9-22,Wilson>Let's take this outside.

384
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,570
<9-22,Wilson>卡普维茨先生刚睡着
<9-22,Wilson>Mr. Koplovitz just got to sleep.

385
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:14,000
<9-23,Cuddy>对不起  她给我们找了个特别棒的阁楼
<9-23,Cuddy>Oh, sorry. She found us this fantastic loft.

386
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,360
<9-25,Cuddy>-外面说吧  -其实那不止是个阁楼
<9-25,Cuddy>- Outside. - I mean, it's not a loft really,

387
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:15,830
<9-25,Cuddy>那更靠近市中心
<9-25,Cuddy>It's just more urban.

388
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,160
<9-25,Cuddy>不是说我多城市化  可毕竟我过去是的
<9-25,Cuddy>Not that I'm urban, but I used to be.

389
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:19,170
<9-25,Cuddy>有两个卧室  还有很美丽的风景
<9-25,Cuddy>It's got two bedrooms. Got wonderful views.

390
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:20,240
<9-25,Cuddy>那真是个好地方
<9-25,Cuddy>It's a really great place.

391
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,120
<10-1,Wilson>手术大概要进行一个小时
<10-1,Wilson>Procedure should take about an hour.

392
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,030
<10-1,Wilson>我会全程监控
<10-1,Wilson>I'll be observing the entire time.

393
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:25,200
<10-1,Wilson>谢谢
<10-1,Wilson>Thanks.

394
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:27,970
<10-2,Tucker>也许如果你能跟阿什利在一起会更好些
<10-2,Tucker>Maybe it'd be better if you stayed with Ashley.

395
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:29,450
<10-2,Tucker>她比我更害怕
<10-2,Tucker>She's more scared than I am.

396
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,340
<10-3,Wilson>她
<10-3,Wilson>Well, she's...

397
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,700
<10-3,Wilson>在她这个年龄
<10-3,Wilson>At her age...

398
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:39,140
<10-3,Wilson>她不应该面对过多关于生与死的问题
<10-3,Wilson>She's not supposed to be dealing with issues of life and death.

399
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,290
<10-4,Tucker>我追她的时候怎么没考虑到这些呢
<10-4,Tucker>Wasn't what I was planning when I went after her.

400
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,180
<10-5,Wilson>你为什么要离开梅丽莎
<10-5,Wilson>Why did you leave Melissa?

401
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,800
<10-6,Tucker>我们很年轻就结婚了  我们
<10-6,Tucker>We got married young. We...

402
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,400
<10-6,Tucker>我也不清楚
<10-6,Tucker>I'm not sure.

403
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,650
<11-1,Wilson>现在没什么好说的
<11-1,Wilson>There's nothing to talk about.

404
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,480
<11-2,House>我需要你给我找一个新的病人的时候
<11-2,House>Why are you doing surgery when I need you

405
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:16,930
<11-2,House>为什么你在做手术
<11-2,House>Finding me a new case?

406
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,910
<11-3,Chase>你不想要新病人
<11-3,Chase>You don't want a new case.

407
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:20,330
<29-6,House>哦  对
<29-6,House>Oh, right.

408
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:21,860
<29-7,Wilson>假装我是来这找威尔森的
<29-7,Wilson>Guess I'm here for Wilson.

409
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:25,500
<11-2,House>很显然你没有告诉我
<11-2,House>Obviously you didn't tell me

410
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,340
<11-3,Chase>卡迪要搬到卢卡斯那里去了
<11-3,Chase>That Cuddy was moving in with Lucas

411
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,670
<11-4,House>因为你在保护我吗
<11-4,House>'cause you were protecting me.

412
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,490
<11-4,House>因为我告诉过你我不反对他们在一起
<11-4,House>Which is odd, since I told you

413
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:33,210
<11-4,House>所以是不是很奇怪
<11-4,House>That I'm fine with their relationship.

414
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,670
<11-4,House>这很明显
<11-4,House>So obviously,

415
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,180
<11-4,House>你质疑这些假设
<11-4,House>You question one of those assumptions

416
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:39,010
<11-4,House>或者你逻辑思维有问题
<11-4,House>Or you have an issue with logic.

417
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,290
<11-5,Wilson>对  你不在意他们约会
<11-5,Wilson>Yes, you're fine with them dating.

418
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,520
<11-5,Wilson>可是搬到一起住
<11-5,Wilson>But moving in together

419
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:45,580
<11-5,Wilson>完全就是另一个层面的问题了
<11-5,Wilson>Is a whole other level of commitment.

420
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:48,820
<11-6,House>现在是21世纪  威尔森
<11-6,House>This is the 21st century, Wilson.

421
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:52,060
<11-6,House>我明白成年人相处的逻辑程序
<11-6,House>I realize that the logical course of any adult relationship

422
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,350
<11-6,House>有一天可能会上床
<11-6,House>Could one day lead to fornication.

423
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:58,610
<11-6,House>可是  她想买个阁楼的事
<11-6,House>Although, the fact that she wants to buy a loft

424
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,310
<11-6,House>也许可以说明他们的关系
<11-6,House>Could actually mean that their relationship

425
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:02,850
<11-6,House>没我想得那么正式
<11-6,House>Is not as serious as I thought.

426
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,510
<11-7,Wilson>哦  天啊  豪斯
<11-7,Wilson>Oh, for god's sake, House,

427
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,640
<11-7,Wilson>别这么对自己
<11-7,Wilson>Don't do this to yourself.

428
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,820
<11-7,Wilson>那是一个阁楼
<11-7,Wilson>It's a loft.

429
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:07,920
<11-7,Wilson>跟开放式的生活来说
<11-7,Wilson>It has no deeper meaning

430
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,030
<11-7,Wilson>没什么深刻含义
<11-7,Wilson>Than open-space living arrangement.

431
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:11,630
<11-8,House>如果你考虑到当她再次看到失去了的
<11-8,House>If you bought into her diatribe

432
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:14,820
<11-8,House>城里的小窝时  会怎样谴责
<11-8,House>About rediscovering her lost city girl roots.

433
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,660
<11-8,House>还有两个卧室
<11-8,House>And two bedrooms.

434
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:17,640
<11-8,House>让结婚许诺变得飘渺无比
<11-8,House>It just reeks of commitment issues.

435
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,600
<11-9,Wilson>没错  但还得考虑她有个孩子
<11-9,Wilson>Yeah. Or she has a baby.

436
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:22,530
<11-10,House>这是中年卡迪所面临的经典问题
<11-10,House>This is classic mid-life Cuddy crisis.

437
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:25,110
<11-10,House>这是她看待双座敞篷车的方式
<11-10,House>This is her version of a two-seat convertible.

438
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:27,790
<11-11,Wilson>是的  显然你可以接受这点
<11-11,Wilson>Yeah, clearly you're fine with it.

439
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,870
<11-12,Chase>威尔森  他的肺大面积受损
<11-12,Chase>Wilson, he's got global lung damage.

440
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:32,730
<11-12,Chase>就是说不是真菌所致  而是五氯酚肺炎
<11-12,Chase>Means it's not fungal. It's PCP pneumonia.

441
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:41,310
<11-13,House>很显然  什么东西
<11-13,House>Obviously something

442
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:43,160
<11-13,House>在破坏他的免疫系统
<11-13,House>Is knocking out his immune system.

443
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,430
<11-13,House>三种可能  艾滋病
<11-13,House>Three options. HIV.

444
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:50,980
<11-13,House>获得性免疫缺陷  或我的最爱  癌症
<11-13,House>Acquired scid, or my personal favorite, cancer.

445
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:54,480
<11-13,House>你肯定会三种都检测
<11-13,House>I'm sure you'll test for all three.

446
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:04,350
<12-1,Wilson>62岁的非洲裔美国人
<12-1,Wilson>62-year-old African-American man

447
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:06,440
<12-1,Wilson>患有淋巴癌  现在处于缓解期
<12-1,Wilson>With lymphoma now in remission.

448
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,370
<12-1,Wilson>我做了CT扫描  在他的左肺上叶
<12-1,Wilson>I did a CT and found a small lesion

449
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:10,400
<12-1,Wilson>发现了一个小小的损伤
<12-1,Wilson>On the upper lobe of his left lung.

450
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,310
<12-1,Wilson>既然他正在缓解期
<12-1,Wilson>If he's in remission,

451
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,180
<12-2,Wilson>你干嘛还给他扫描呢
<12-2,Wilson>Why did you bother scanning him?

452
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,600
<12-2,Wilson>在一次例行检查中
<12-2,Wilson>During a routine follow-up,

453
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,550
<12-2,Wilson>我发现病人情绪很低落
<12-2,Wilson>I realized the patient was depressed.

454
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:19,100
<12-2,Wilson>真是重大发现啊
<12-2,Wilson>Wow. That's quite a call.

455
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,920
<12-3,Wilson>谢谢  诊断显示
<12-3,Wilson>Thanks. The treatment indicate--

456
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:25,680
<12-4,House>哦  抱歉
<12-4,House>Oh, I'm sorry.

457
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,490
<12-4,House>我不知道你正在忙
<12-4,House>I didn't realize you were in the middle of something.

458
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:29,880
<12-5,Wilson>这是会议室
<12-5,Wilson>It's a conference room

459
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,400
<12-5,Wilson>四周都是玻璃墙
<12-5,Wilson>With glass walls.

460
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,930
<12-5,Wilson>你觉得我会一个人呆在这儿
<12-5,Wilson>You thought I'd be alone?

461
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:34,980
<12-6,House>你的病人得了癌症
<12-6,House>Your patient has cancer.

462
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:36,760
<12-6,House>不是那个家伙
<12-6,House>Not that guy.

463
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:38,870
<12-6,House>他可能也得了癌症
<12-6,House>He probably also has cancer.

464
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,800
<12-6,House>可能他也是你的朋友
<12-6,House>And he's probably also your buddy.

465
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,820
<12-6,House>我猜你会想知道
<12-6,House>Thought you'd want to know.

466
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:45,840
<12-6,House>因为那样你就欠我100美元
<12-6,House>'cause you owe me 100 bucks.

467
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:54,350
<13-1,Wilson>你患了急性淋巴细胞白血病
<13-1,Wilson>You have acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

468
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:55,190
<13-1,Wilson>简称A.L.L.
<13-1,Wilson>A.L.L.

469
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:00,280
<13-2,Melissa>也就是说旧病复发啦
<13-2,Melissa>So it is a recurrence.

470
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,540
<13-3,Wilson>不  和那个不同  是另一种白血病
<13-3,Wilson>No. It's different. It's a second leukemia.

471
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:06,040
<13-3,Wilson>可能是五年前所做的化疗引起的
<13-3,Wilson>Probably caused by the chemotherapy we gave him five years ago.

472
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,580
<13-4,Tucker>所以你才没发现
<13-4,Tucker>That's why you didn't see it.

473
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:10,040
<13-4,Tucker>他们可能重新命名为讽刺性白血病
<13-4,Tucker>Maybe they can rename it ironic leukemia.

474
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,600
<13-5,Wilson>并不是没希望治好
<13-5,Wilson>This is not the end.

475
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,090
<13-5,Wilson>检测显示癌细胞只在脑部有
<13-5,Wilson>Tests show that the cancer is limited to your brain.

476
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:15,120
<13-5,Wilson>这是好消息
<13-5,Wilson>That's good news.

477
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,120
<13-6,Ashley>他脑部有癌细胞怎么会是好消息呢
<13-6,Ashley>How can cancer in his head be good news?

478
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,680
<13-7,Wilson>血脑屏障将脑部的血
<13-7,Wilson>The blood brain barrier separates

479
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,970
<13-7,Wilson>和身体里的血液隔开
<13-7,Wilson>The blood in your head from the blood in your body.

480
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:24,430
<13-7,Wilson>也就封锁住了癌细胞
<13-7,Wilson>Keeps the cancer bottled up.

481
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:25,730
<13-7,Wilson>我们可以进行治愈
<13-7,Wilson>We can go for a cure.

482
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:28,360
<13-8,Melissa>那告诉我 治愈的希望有多大
<13-8,Melissa>So give me the numbers. What are we looking at?

483
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,970
<13-9,Wilson>90%的希望能治愈
<13-9,Wilson>90% chance of cure.

484
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:31,900
<13-9,Wilson>是吗
<13-9,Wilson>Really?

485
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,590
<13-10,Melissa>万一我们是那不幸的10%呢
<13-10,Melissa>What if we're in the 10%?

486
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,830
<13-11,Wilson>那么病情会持续恶化
<13-11,Wilson>Steady decline.

487
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:37,190
<13-11,Wilson>还可以享受六个月的美好生活
<13-11,Wilson>But six months of a good quality life.

488
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,030
<13-12,Emily>他还得再进行一次
<13-12,Emily>Does he have to go through

489
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:40,250
<13-12,Emily>-骨髓移植吗  -不需要
<13-12,Emily>- Another bone marrow transplant? - No.

490
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:41,550
<13-13,Wilson>化疗
<13-13,Wilson>Chemotherapy.

491
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,150
<13-13,Wilson>只需用药物就行了
<13-13,Wilson>We can go at this with drugs alone.

492
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,200
<13-14,Melissa>什么时候开始治疗呢
<13-14,Melissa>When do we get started?

493
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,100
<13-15,Wilson>先通过外科手术植入分流器
<13-15,Wilson>We begin by surgically planting a shunt

494
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,300
<13-15,Wilson>然后再把药物放入脑部
<13-15,Wilson>So we can get the drugs directly into your brain.

495
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,720
<13-15,Wilson>我已经定好了手术室
<13-15,Wilson>I already booked the O.R.

496
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,130
<13-16,Tucker>你是唯一一个可以让癌症
<13-16,Tucker>You're the only one who can make cancer

497
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:53,300
<13-16,Tucker>听起来是好消息的医生
<13-16,Tucker>Sound like good news.

498
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,400
<13-17,Wilson>我们帮你移除癌细胞  你就可以出院了
<13-17,Wilson>We get it out of your head and you walk out of here

499
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,330
<13-17,Wilson>胳膊麻痹症没了  癌症也好了
<13-17,Wilson>Paralysis gone and cancer-free.

500
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:03,580
<14-1,Wilson>你还得签一份医疗授权书
<14-1,Wilson>We also need you to sign a health care proxy.

501
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,450
<14-1,Wilson>如果手术过程中出现意外
<14-1,Wilson>If something goes wrong in surgery,

502
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:07,740
<14-1,Wilson>得有人来替你做决定
<14-1,Wilson>Someone needs to be appointed to make decisions for you.

503
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,420
<14-2,Ashley>出现意外的可能有多大
<14-2,Ashley>What are the chances of that happening?

504
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,630
<14-3,Wilson>非常小
<14-3,Wilson>Very remote.

505
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:12,930
<14-4,Tucker>我想让梅丽莎当我的代理人
<14-4,Tucker>I think maybe Melissa should be my proxy.

506
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:14,180
<14-5,Ashley>-什么  -不
<14-5,Ashley>- What?  - No.

507
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,870
<14-6,Foreman>请让一下  豪斯的新病人
<14-6,Foreman>Coming through. House got a new case.

508
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:21,770
<14-7,House>修改后的手术室安排表 抱歉  威尔森  和你的撞一块儿了
<14-7,House>Revised O.R. Schedule. Sorry, wilson, had to bump you.

509
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,110
<14-7,House>你的病人还没生命垂危
<14-7,House>It's not like your guy's bleeding out of his eyes.

510
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,490
<14-8,Wilson>豪斯  你的病人也没有奄奄一息
<14-8,Wilson>House, your guy's not bleeding out of his eyes either.

511
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:27,670
<14-9,House>安排手术室的护士  看来是他快不行了
<14-9,House>The nurse who books the O.R. Thinks he is.

512
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,990
<14-10,Wilson>你的手术没我的紧急
<14-10,Wilson>Your case is no more urgent than mine.

513
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:30,660
<14-11,House>是的  但你比我要有耐心的多
<14-11,House>Yeah, but you're way more patient.

514
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,670
<14-12,Wilson>没关系
<14-12,Wilson>It's okay.

515
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,090
<14-12,Wilson>你们可以在准备区讨论一下
<14-12,Wilson>You can talk about the--the paperwork

516
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:37,260
<14-12,Wilson>文件的事情
<14-12,Wilson>In the prep area.

517
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,020
<15-1,Ashley>比起我来  你更信任她
<15-1,Ashley>You trust her more than me.

518
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,600
<15-2,Tucker>对于这件事  是的
<15-2,Tucker>About this, yes.

519
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,400
<15-2,Tucker>你一路都顺顺利利
<15-2,Tucker>You've been through the good stuff,

520
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:49,200
<15-2,Tucker>但梅丽莎经历了人间地狱 现在又回到我身边
<15-2,Tucker>But Melissa's been to hell and back with me.

521
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,110
<15-2,Tucker>她最能鼓舞我度过这个难关
<15-2,Tucker>She gives me the best shot of getting through this.

522
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:55,520
<15-3,Ashley>-你还爱着她  -别说傻话
<15-3,Ashley>- You still love her. - Don't be silly.

523
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,890
<15-4,Tucker>我爱你
<15-4,Tucker>I love you.

524
00:22:58,430 --> 00:22:59,270
<15-4,Tucker>求你了
<15-4,Tucker>Please...

525
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:01,450
<15-4,Tucker>不要想太多好吗
<15-4,Tucker>Don't make this into more than it is.

526
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,030
<16-3,Wilson>-好了  有感觉吗  -没有
<16-3,Wilson>- Okay, anything?  - No.

527
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:13,120
<16-4,Tucker>-现在能感觉到吗  -不能
<16-4,Tucker>- Can you feel this?  - No.

528
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:16,170
<16-5,Wilson>-这里呢  -也没有
<16-5,Wilson>- How about here?  - No.

529
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,280
<16-7,Wilson>其他人呢
<16-7,Wilson>Where is everybody?

530
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,700
<16-8,Tucker>梅丽莎和艾米丽到楼下去
<16-8,Tucker>Melissa and Emily went downstairs

531
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,940
<16-8,Tucker>-买早餐了  -阿什利呢
<16-8,Tucker>- To get some breakfast. - Ashley?

532
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,280
<16-10,Tucker>她有工作
<16-10,Tucker>She had work to do.

533
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,760
<16-11,Wilson>我还以为她今天休假
<16-11,Wilson>I thought she was off today.

534
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:27,990
<16-12,Tucker>其实她是没事
<16-12,Tucker>Well, she didn't really have work to do.

535
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:28,810
<16-12,Tucker>只是她有点生气
<16-12,Tucker>She was just pissed

536
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:30,630
<16-12,Tucker>所以假装有工作要做
<16-12,Tucker>So she pretended to have work to do.

537
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:31,940
<16-12,Tucker>我让她这么做的
<16-12,Tucker>I let her pretend.

538
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:33,960
<16-12,Tucker>好吧
<16-12,Tucker>Okay.

539
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:36,870
<16-13,Wilson>动动手指试试
<16-13,Wilson>Move your fingers.

540
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,870
<16-14,Wilson>化疗没用
<16-14,Wilson>The chemo's not working.

541
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:47,830
<16-15,Tucker>是不是也意味着不是癌症吗
<16-15,Tucker>Does that mean it's not cancer?

542
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:51,290
<16-16,Wilson>不  是表明经过第一轮的化疗
<16-16,Wilson>No. It means the chemo from your first round of treatment

543
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,200
<16-16,Wilson>白血病产生了抵抗
<16-16,Wilson>Has made the leukemia resistant.

544
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:56,920
<16-17,Tucker>那我是那不能被治愈的10%了
<16-17,Tucker>So I'm in the 10% that don't get cured.

545
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:01,250
<16-18,Wilson>也可能不是
<16-18,Wilson>Maybe not.

546
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:05,770
<17-1,House>我们刚从一个家伙的肺里取出一个螺丝钉
<17-1,House>We just removed a screw from a guy's lung.

547
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:07,700
<17-1,House>但奇怪的是他却没好起来
<17-1,House>And the weird thing is he didn't get better.

548
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,610
<17-1,House>知道那意味着什么吗
<17-1,House>Any idea what that means?

549
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:11,450
<17-2,Wilson>意味着你没有听我说话
<17-2,Wilson>It means you're not listening to me.

550
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,310
<17-3,House>错  意味着我在忽视你来表达观点
<17-3,House>No. It means I'm ignoring you to make a point.

551
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:14,290
<17-3,House>这两者是有区别的
<17-3,House>There is a difference.

552
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:15,330
<17-4,Wilson>你说的太含蓄  太深奥了
<17-4,Wilson>The problem with that technique

553
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:17,290
<17-4,Wilson>我不知道你想说明什么
<17-4,Wilson>Is I have no idea what point you're making.

554
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:20,460
<17-5,House>那就是你的想法不值得我回应
<17-5,House>That your idea is implicitly not worth responding to.

555
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,970
<17-5,House>将病人的化疗计量加倍是很愚蠢的做法
<17-5,House>Doubling your patient's chemo dose is stupid.

556
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:25,250
<17-5,House>该死  现在明确了吧
<17-5,House>Damn. Now it's explicit.

557
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:26,800
<17-6,Wilson>那可以让癌细胞
<17-6,Wilson>It could swamp out the resistance

558
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,870
<17-6,Wilson>的抵抗力减弱
<17-6,Wilson>Of the cancer cells.

559
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:29,460
<17-7,House>理论上是这样没错  但不会
<17-7,House>The fact that it theoretically should work

560
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,970
<17-7,House>让这个做法精明多少
<17-7,House>Doesn't make it any less stupid.

561
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,430
<17-8,Wilson>当然会  你也肯定会这样做
<17-8,Wilson>Of course it does. It's exactly what you would do.

562
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:34,940
<17-9,House>我是我  你是你
<17-9,House>I'm me. You're you.

563
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:40,440
<17-10,Wilson>桌子就是桌子
<17-10,Wilson>And a table is a table.

564
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,490
<17-11,House>而化疗是毒药
<17-11,House>And chemo is poison.

565
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:44,490
<17-11,House>双重化疗就是双倍毒药
<17-11,House>And double chemo is double poison.

566
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:46,860
<17-11,House>情况变糟的时候  我能应付
<17-11,House>I can handle it when things go wrong.

567
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:48,170
<17-11,House>你却不能
<17-11,House>You can't.

568
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:52,240
<17-11,House>情况可能会变得越来越糟
<17-11,House>And things could go very, very wrong.

569
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,270
<17-12,Wilson>我能处理好
<17-12,Wilson>I can handle it.

570
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:04,070
<18-1,Tucker>听起来很危险嘛
<18-1,Tucker>Sounds pretty dangerous.

571
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:05,820
<18-2,Wilson>确实
<18-2,Wilson>It is.

572
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,490
<18-3,Tucker>你怎么想  梅尔
<18-3,Tucker>What do you think, Mel?

573
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,120
<18-4,Melissa>我觉得你应该问阿什利
<18-4,Melissa>I think you should call Ashley.

574
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,440
<18-5,Tucker>你是我的亲人
<18-5,Tucker>You're my family.

575
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:21,860
<18-5,Tucker>我很抱歉曾经忘记了这一点
<18-5,Tucker>I'm sorry I forgot that.

576
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,510
<18-6,Emily>我认为你该试试
<18-6,Emily>I think that you should try

577
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:31,070
<18-6,Emily>只要能让我们团聚的更久一点
<18-6,Emily>Whatever could keep you with us longer.

578
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:33,810
<18-6,Emily>是啊
<18-6,Emily>Yeah.

579
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:02,760
<19-1,Emily>你瞧
<19-1,Emily>Look.

580
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,890
<19-2,Tucker>我的手臂可以动了
<19-2,Tucker>I can move them.

581
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:05,310
<19-4,Melissa>嘿  谢谢
<19-4,Melissa>Hey! Thank you.

582
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:09,690
<19-5,Tucker>吉姆  怎么了
<19-5,Tucker>What is it, Jim?

583
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,510
<19-6,Wilson>我需要去做一些化验
<19-6,Wilson>I'm gonna need to run some tests.

584
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:17,070
<20-1,Taub>表皮内水疱
<20-1,Taub>Intraepidermal superficial bullae.

585
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:19,590
<20-2,Thirteen>-可能是天孢疮  -也可能是上火
<20-2,Thirteen>- Could be pemphigus. - Or it could be from the fire.

586
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:20,960
<20-3,Taub>否则他就挂了
<20-3,Taub>Either way, he's dead.

587
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:23,310
<20-3,Taub>我们无法止住渗液渗出
<20-3,Taub>We can't stop the oozing.

588
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:24,720
<20-4,House>没关系
<20-4,House>Don't care.

589
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:29,440
<20-4,House>我来这儿是因为现在1:15了
<20-4,House>I'm here because it's 1:15

590
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,370
<20-4,House>而威尔森在12:45就开始做化验
<20-4,House>And Wilson started testing at 12:45.

591
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:34,320
<20-5,Wilson>-这就意味着...  -癌细胞消失了
<20-5,Wilson>- Which means... - The cancer's gone.

592
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:37,810
<20-5,Wilson>可他将近一半的肝细胞死亡了
<20-5,Wilson>But over half his hepatocytes are dead.

593
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:41,080
<20-6,Taub>仅在24小时之内吗
<20-6,Taub>In only 24 hours?

594
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:43,940
<20-7,Wilson>他需要移植一个新肝
<20-7,Wilson>He needs a new liver.

595
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:48,410
<20-8,House>我们往好处想想
<20-8,House>Look on the bright side.

596
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:51,660
<20-8,House>你可以发布关于本病例的研究报告
<20-8,House>You can publish the results of this case study.

597
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,040
<20-8,House>使得他人不重蹈覆辙
<20-8,House>No one will ever double the dose again.

598
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:02,700
<21-1,Wilson>双倍剂量的化疗消灭了你的癌细胞
<21-1,Wilson>The double dose of chemo got rid of your cancer.

599
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:05,790
<21-1,Wilson>但同时也损害了你的肝
<21-1,Wilson>But it also trashed your liver.

600
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:08,500
<21-1,Wilson>如果找不到与你匹配的肝
<21-1,Wilson>If I don't find you a new liver,

601
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:12,250
<21-1,Wilson>那你就只能活24小时了
<21-1,Wilson>You've only got about 24 hours left.

602
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,740
<21-2,Emily>我们现在能做什么吗
<21-2,Emily>So what do we do now?

603
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:21,500
<21-3,Wilson>你父亲已位列等待肝移植候选人的首位
<21-3,Wilson>Your father's been moved to the top of the transplant list.

604
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,460
<21-3,Wilson>但我们现在唯一能做的就是等待
<21-3,Wilson>But all we really can do is wait.

605
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:25,480
<21-4,Melissa>就这些了吗  只能等待吗
<21-4,Melissa>That's it? We wait?

606
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,720
<21-4,Melissa>告诉我哪些是我能做的
<21-4,Melissa>Tell me something that I can do.

607
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:28,080
<21-4,Melissa>我很抱歉  梅尔
<21-4,Melissa>I'm sorry, Mel.

608
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,410
<21-5,Wilson>你和艾米丽与塔克的血型都不匹配
<21-5,Wilson>You and Emily don't Match Tuck's blood type.

609
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:31,850
<21-5,Wilson>阿什利也不匹配
<21-5,Wilson>And neither does Ashley.

610
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,880
<21-5,Wilson>所以活体捐赠是没希望了
<21-5,Wilson>So a live liver donation is out.

611
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:39,060
<21-5,Wilson>你们唯一能做的就是和现在一样
<21-5,Wilson>The best thing to do is just what you've been doing.

612
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,050
<21-5,Wilson>陪伴在他身边
<21-5,Wilson>Be together.

613
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:49,090
<21-6,House>但愿他已经告诉你  你活不长了
<21-6,House>Hope he already told you that you're gonna die.

614
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:51,640
<21-6,House>否则我下面要说的话就会非常不合时宜
<21-6,House>'Cause it's gonna make what I'm about to say a lot more relevant.

615
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,810
<21-7,Wilson>豪斯  我知道走廊里在下雨
<21-7,Wilson>House, I know it's raining out there in the hallway,

616
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:57,590
<21-8,House>可是...我刚才在急诊室帮病人做测试
<21-8,House>But... I was just in the ER testing my patient

617
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:59,070
<21-8,House>他的自主神经性功能失调
<21-8,House>For autonomic dysfunction.

618
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,990
<21-8,House>只有这个部门的淋浴够大
<21-8,House>It's the only department with a shower big enough

619
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:03,510
<21-8,House>足以容纳整个小组和心脏监护仪
<21-8,House>For the whole team, plus the cardiac monitors,

620
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:05,970
<21-8,House>还有个我  算了  相关话题
<21-8,House>Plus me. Anyway, relevant part,

621
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:07,430
<21-8,House>就在我们推他出去的时候
<21-8,House>We're just wheeling the guy out,

622
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:08,450
<21-8,House>来了个急救
<21-8,House>Trauma came in.

623
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,400
<21-8,House>一辆摩托车撞墙上了
<21-8,House>Motorcycle versus semi.

624
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,340
<21-9,Wilson>有多严重
<21-9,Wilson>How bad?

625
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,400
<21-10,House>他不走运  不过你的肝挺走运
<21-10,House>Bad for the motorcycle. Good for your liver.

626
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,570
<21-10,House>血检结果显示匹配
<21-10,House>Blood type's a match.

627
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:15,610
<21-11,Wilson>怎么没人呼我
<21-11,Wilson>Why wasn't I paged?

628
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,470
<21-12,House>因为有个问题
<21-12,House>Because there's a problem.

629
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:19,190
<21-12,House>他不是器官捐赠者
<21-12,House>No organ donor card.

630
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:20,850
<21-12,House>死者的姐姐是直系亲属
<21-12,House>Dead guy's sister is next of kin.

631
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:22,750
<21-13,Wilson>她拒绝捐赠
<21-13,Wilson>She's refusing to allow the donation.

632
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:24,450
<21-14,House>-她在哪儿  -20分钟的路程
<21-14,House>- Where is she?  - 20 minutes away.

633
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:30,130
<22-1,Wilson>当你得知弟弟的死讯后
<22-1,Wilson>How do you get the call that your brother's dead

634
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:31,680
<22-1,Wilson>你还会出门吗
<22-1,Wilson>And then run out the door?

635
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,280
<22-1,Wilson>哦哦哦  这到提醒了我
<22-1,Wilson>oh--oh--oh, that reminds me,

636
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,450
<22-1,Wilson>我要去取干洗的衣服
<22-1,Wilson>I-I had dry cleaning to pick up."

637
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,960
<22-2,House>库迪房子买了没
<22-2,House>Did Cuddy buy the place?

638
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,000
<22-3,Wilson>还没  怎么了
<22-3,Wilson>Not yet. You okay?

639
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:43,620
<22-4,House>只是聊聊
<22-4,House>Just making conversation.

640
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,570
<22-4,House>你的话题比较无聊
<22-4,House>Yours was getting boring.

641
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:46,930
<22-5,Wilson>你在打什么注意
<22-5,Wilson>What are you planning?

642
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:48,790
<22-6,House>啥注意都没有
<22-6,House>I'm not planning anything.

643
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:49,750
<22-7,Wilson>我不信
<22-7,Wilson>And I don't believe you.

644
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:51,630
<22-7,Wilson>你打算怎么惩罚她和卢卡斯谈恋爱
<22-7,Wilson>How are you gonna punish her for dating Lucas?

645
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:53,970
<22-8,House>额  这是话题也开始变得无聊
<22-8,House>Okay, now this conversation is getting boring.

646
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:58,570
<22-9,Wilson>-你真的没事吗  -不
<22-9,Wilson>- Are you really okay? - No!

647
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:02,510
<22-10,House>我不好  一点也不好
<22-10,House>I am not okay. Not even close.

648
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:07,900
<22-11,Wilson>看吧  你还是挺成熟的
<22-11,Wilson>Wow. Okay. See, that's very adult of you.

649
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:09,320
<22-12,House>才不是呢
<22-12,House>No, it isn't.

650
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,550
<22-12,House>只是面对现实
<22-12,House>It's just me accepting the fact

651
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:13,550
<22-12,House>深知我已无能为力并往前看而已
<22-12,House>That there's nothing I can do and moving on.

652
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:16,720
<22-13,Wilson>我想这就是我对成熟的定义
<22-13,Wilson>Which is, I think, the definition of adulthood.

653
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,270
<22-14,House>要是这样的话  做孩子更开心一些
<22-14,House>Well, if it is, being a kid is a lot more fun.

654
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:22,180
<22-15,House>好戏上演了
<22-15,House>Showtime.

655
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:32,620
<23-1,Aikoa Tanaka>我跟他已经很多年没说过话了
<23-1,Aikoa Tanaka>I didn't speak to him for years.

656
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,080
<23-1,Aikoa Tanaka>可当我父母去世后
<23-1,Aikoa Tanaka>But when my parents died,

657
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,720
<23-1,Aikoa Tanaka>在他们的葬礼上我们和好如初了
<23-1,Aikoa Tanaka>At their funeral, we made peace.

658
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:43,200
<23-1,Aikoa Tanaka>这一定是父母在天有灵
<23-1,Aikoa Tanaka>Our parents must've blessed it.

659
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,440
<23-2,Wilson>我认为你父母必然也希望他在人世间
<23-2,Wilson>And I'm sure they would want him to do good

660
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,770
<23-2,Wilson>弥留之际做回善事
<23-2,Wilson>With his last act in this world.

661
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:51,270
<23-3,Aikoa Tanaka>他们希望我们友好相处
<23-3,Aikoa Tanaka>They wanted us to be friends.

662
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,580
<23-3,Aikoa Tanaka>以前我们之间的联系不太紧密
<23-3,Aikoa Tanaka>Our relationship wasn't strong,

663
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,450
<23-3,Aikoa Tanaka>但是在逐渐密切
<23-3,Aikoa Tanaka>But it was growing.

664
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,340
<23-3,Aikoa Tanaka>如果我让你们亵渎他的遗体
<23-3,Aikoa Tanaka>If I allow you to defile his body,

665
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,770
<23-3,Aikoa Tanaka>这会有损于我们之间的纽带
<23-3,Aikoa Tanaka>It will destroy that bond.

666
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:02,790
<23-3,Aikoa Tanaka>整个平衡就会遭到破坏
<23-3,Aikoa Tanaka>The itai will be harmed.

667
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:05,730
<23-4,Wilson>可这将拯救我的病人的生命
<23-4,Wilson>It will save my patient's life.

668
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:13,850
<23-5,House>如果我告诉你他还没死  你怎么想
<23-5,House>What if I told you that he wasn't dead?

669
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:17,120
<23-6,Aikoa Tanaka>你的意思是我弟还活着吗
<23-6,Aikoa Tanaka>Are you saying my brother is still alive?

670
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:19,040
<23-7,House>我说你是个笨蛋
<23-7,House>I'm saying you're being an idiot.

671
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:21,080
<23-7,House>但是我没时间说服你脱离你的信仰
<23-7,House>But I don't have time to talk you out of your religion

672
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,560
<23-7,House>因而我有责任给你一个建议
<23-7,House>So I'm stuck with giving you a technicality

673
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:25,140
<23-7,House>让你自己去判断孰是孰非
<23-7,House>That will let you justify doing the right thing.

674
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:30,460
<23-7,House>如果他生前打算做的最后一件事就是捐赠他的一部分肝  你怎么想呢
<23-7,House>What if his last living act was to donate a part of his liver?

675
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:31,770
<23-8,Aikoa Tanaka>不是全部的肝
<23-8,Aikoa Tanaka>Not the whole thing,

676
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:34,210
<23-8,Aikoa Tanaka>只是一小块而已
<23-8,Aikoa Tanaka>Just one small piece.

677
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:37,080
<23-8,Aikoa Tanaka>我还是不会去亵渎遗体
<23-8,Aikoa Tanaka>Then I'm not defiling a dead body.

678
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:38,210
<23-9,Wilson>豪斯
<23-9,Wilson>House.

679
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:41,110
<23-10,House>人生在世最后能做的一件善举
<23-10,House>The last generous act of a living person.

680
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,710
<23-11,Wilson>豪斯  太晚了
<23-11,Wilson>House, it's too late.

681
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:46,110
<23-11,Wilson>他的肝已经开始衰竭了
<23-11,Wilson>The liver started to degrade.

682
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:48,530
<23-11,Wilson>已经不适合做移植了
<23-11,Wilson>It's no longer viable for transplant.

683
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,310
<23-12,House>真是出好戏
<23-12,House>Well played.

684
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:56,170
<23-12,House>你的信仰刚杀了一个人
<23-12,House>Religion just killed another person.

685
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,230
<24-1,Tucker>这不公平  吉姆
<24-1,Tucker>It's not fair, Jim.

686
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,090
<24-1,Tucker>你刚使得我们家庭团圆
<24-1,Tucker>You just helped me get my family back together.

687
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:14,620
<24-1,Tucker>我还没准备好
<24-1,Tucker>I'm--I'm not ready.

688
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:22,170
<24-1,Tucker>我本可以与他们多待六个月
<24-1,Tucker>I would've had six more months with them

689
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:24,370
<24-1,Tucker>如果你没有给我加倍化疗的话
<24-1,Tucker>If you hadn't given me that extra chemo.

690
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,420
<24-1,Tucker>可我现在连一天都活不了
<24-1,Tucker>Now I have less than one day.

691
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,200
<24-2,Wilson>我很抱歉  你我都深知这些风险
<24-2,Wilson>I'm sorry. We knew the risks.

692
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:31,730
<24-3,Tucker>我不想再次失去她们
<24-3,Tucker>I don't want to lose them again.

693
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:34,280
<24-3,Tucker>我也不能再次失去她们
<24-3,Tucker>I can't lose them again.

694
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:39,000
<24-4,Wilson>我们已经尽力了
<24-4,Wilson>There's nothing more we can do.

695
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:44,700
<24-5,Tucker>五年前那次我需要输血的时候
<24-5,Tucker>Five years ago, when I needed a transfusion,

696
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:46,640
<24-5,Tucker>你用的是你的血
<24-5,Tucker>You used your own blood.

697
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,250
<24-5,Tucker>我们血型一样
<24-5,Tucker>We have the same type.

698
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:52,770
<24-5,Tucker>这就意味着你可以捐一部分肝给我
<24-5,Tucker>Which means you can give me a part of your liver.

699
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,710
<24-6,Wilson>-我是你的医生  -可你也是我朋友啊
<24-6,Wilson>- I'm your doctor. - You're my friend.

700
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,610
<24-7,Tucker>因为你也是我的医生我就该死吗
<24-7,Tucker>Should I die because you're also my doctor?

701
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:02,720
<24-8,Wilson>-当然不是  -那成  你被解雇了
<24-8,Wilson>- Of course not. - Fine then. You're fired.

702
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:04,320
<24-9,Tucker>现在你仅仅是我的朋友了
<24-9,Tucker>Now you're just my friend.

703
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,090
<24-9,Tucker>你该做出正确的选择
<24-9,Tucker>Now you can do what's right.

704
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:10,870
<24-10,Wilson>塔克  这...
<24-10,Wilson>Tucker, it's...

705
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:13,650
<24-10,Wilson>我不能
<24-10,Wilson>I can't.

706
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:25,520
<25-1,House>和鸽子姐妹[奇夫妻里的角色]约会去了吗
<25-1,House>Late night with the pigeon sisters?

707
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:29,430
<25-2,Wilson>我可不想每天
<25-2,Wilson>Every now and again, I'd like to come home

708
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:30,800
<25-2,Wilson>一回家就受审
<25-2,Wilson>Without getting interrogated.

709
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:35,180
<25-3,House>某人心情不好
<25-3,House>Someone's cranky.

710
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,080
<25-3,House>又晚归
<25-3,House>And late.

711
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:38,130
<25-3,House>你去哪里了
<25-3,House>Where were you?

712
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:39,960
<25-4,Wilson>去喝了一杯
<25-4,Wilson>Just getting a drink.

713
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,730
<25-4,Wilson>怎么回事  怎么我的冷冻食品
<25-4,Wilson>What? Why are all my frozen dinners

714
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:43,890
<25-4,Wilson>要放在桌子上解冻
<25-4,Wilson>Thawing on the counter?

715
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:47,090
<25-5,House>我得腾点地方放我的玛格丽塔果冻鸡尾酒
<25-5,House>I needed room for my margarita jell-o shots.

716
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:49,130
<25-5,House>我用试管代替了瓶子
<25-5,House>I use test tubes as bottles

717
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:51,080
<25-5,House>这样它们就和我的手杖有同样的形状
<25-5,House>So they'll be shaped like my cane.

718
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:54,880
<25-6,House>你有这么棒的酒友
<25-6,House>Why'd you go out drinking alone

719
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,590
<25-6,House>干嘛还出去自己喝闷酒呢
<25-6,House>When you got such great company here?

720
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:05,520
<25-7,Wilson>塔克想让我捐我的肝脏给他
<25-7,Wilson>Tucker wants me to donate a lobe of my liver to him.

721
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:08,240
<25-8,House>那你就去喝酒
<25-8,House>And you were out drinking.

722
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:11,270
<25-8,House>你真的在考虑这个吗
<25-8,House>So you're actually considering this?

723
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,810
<25-9,Wilson>没错  我去把我的肝泡在酒精里
<25-9,Wilson>Yeah. I was out marinating my liver in alcohol

724
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:17,300
<25-9,Wilson>为移植做准备  没错
<25-9,Wilson>To get it ready for the transplant. Yeah.

725
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:19,110
<25-10,House>你嘴上这么说
<25-10,House>Your mouth says no,

726
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,300
<25-10,House>但你脸上可悲的表情出卖了你
<25-10,House>But your pathetic attempt at a deflection

727
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,010
<25-10,House>你脸上写满了内疚
<25-10,House>Has guilt written all over it.

728
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:26,320
<25-11,Wilson>是我的错  都是我的错
<25-11,Wilson>It's my fault. It is my fault!

729
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:28,170
<25-11,Wilson>我让他做的化疗太多了
<25-11,Wilson>I gave him too much chemo.

730
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,780
<25-12,House>你治好了他的癌症
<25-12,House>You cured his cancer.

731
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:33,110
<25-13,Wilson>-但在治疗的同时却把他推向死亡  -瞎说
<25-13,Wilson>- And killed him in the process. - Quibbles.

732
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,810
<25-14,House>他患有并发症  是意料之中的事
<25-14,House>He's had a predictable complication.

733
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:40,110
<25-15,House>双重惊喜  屋漏偏逢连夜雨
<25-15,House>Surprise. Bad things happen to people who are sick.

734
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:41,600
<25-15,House>这不是你责任
<25-15,House>Doesn't make you responsible.

735
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:45,390
<25-16,Wilson>不  不是法律责任的问题  是道德问题
<25-16,Wilson>Oh, no...not legally. Ethically.

736
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:48,190
<25-16,Wilson>-道德  -桌子就是桌子
<25-16,Wilson>- Ethically! - A table is a table.

737
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:50,210
<25-17,House>别做个可怜虫  威尔森
<25-17,House>Don't be a doormat, Wilson.

738
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:54,480
<25-18,Wilson>伙计  你...你肆意毁掉我的食物
<25-18,Wilson>Boy, you are...you willfully ruined my food

739
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,860
<25-18,Wilson>还霸占我的客厅
<25-18,Wilson>And have taken over my living room

740
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,930
<25-18,Wilson>其实你已经把我当可怜虫了
<25-18,Wilson>Because you already think I'm a doormat!

741
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,310
<25-18,Wilson>你听着
<25-18,Wilson>You know what...

742
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:05,670
<25-18,Wilson>你错了
<25-18,Wilson>You're wrong.

743
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:10,020
<25-18,Wilson>你给我收拾东西走人
<25-18,Wilson>You...clean up your stuff and get out.

744
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:14,710
<25-18,Wilson>你错了
<25-18,Wilson>You're wrong.

745
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,270
<26-1,Wilson>塔克怎么样了
<26-1,Wilson>How's Tucker?

746
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:27,780
<26-2,Sandy>没什么好转
<26-2,Sandy>Um, still not dancing.

747
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,950
<26-2,Sandy>但戴尔·克林顿的透视结果出来了
<26-2,Sandy>But scans came in on del clinton.

748
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,570
<26-2,Sandy>-是个好消息  -谢谢
<26-2,Sandy>- It's good news. - Thanks.

749
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:36,610
<26-3,Wilson>塔克要是情况变坏了  马上告诉我
<26-3,Wilson>Let me know as soon as Tucker takes a turn for the worse.

750
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:37,630
<26-3,Wilson>我想陪在他身边
<26-3,Wilson>I want to be there.

751
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:45,330
<27-1,Wilson>看到肺上部这个小店了吗
<27-1,Wilson>See that small spot at the top of the lung?

752
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:48,980
<27-1,Wilson>那是以前的  这是现在的
<27-1,Wilson>That was then. This is now.

753
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:49,920
<27-1,Wilson>小点不见了
<27-1,Wilson>Spot's gone.

754
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:54,790
<27-2,Del>-那个迷你点  是吗  -就是它
<27-2,Del>- That tiny little spot, huh? - Yeah.

755
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:56,480
<27-3,Wilson>不怎么明显是吧
<27-3,Wilson>It's not too impressive, is it?

756
00:34:58,050 --> 00:34:59,890
<27-4,Del>就是那个小不点儿差点儿杀了我
<27-4,Del>That little dot could've killed me?

757
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:01,490
<27-4,Del>是啊
<27-4,Del>Yeah.

758
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,160
<27-5,Wilson>幸运地是  我们提早抓住它了
<27-5,Wilson>Fortunately, we caught it early.

759
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:06,640
<27-5,Wilson>会好起来的
<27-5,Wilson>It's gonna be okay.

760
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:08,860
<27-6,Del>太让我惊讶了
<27-6,Del>That's amazing.

761
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:14,130
<27-6,Del>你把这些都清除了  还没跟我孙子说
<27-6,Del>You got all this off me not talking about my grandkids.

762
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:20,920
<28-1,Cuddy>谢谢  邦妮
<28-1,Cuddy>Thanks, Bonnie.

763
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:24,750
<28-1,Cuddy>我会继续耐心等待的
<28-1,Cuddy>Just gonna have to sit tight for a while.

764
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:26,670
<28-1,Cuddy>好的
<28-1,Cuddy>Okay.

765
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:33,160
<28-1,Cuddy>我给一个阁楼出了价
<28-1,Cuddy>I put an offer on the loft.

766
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,510
<28-1,Cuddy>卖家拒绝了我
<28-1,Cuddy>Seller turned me down.

767
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:37,170
<28-1,Cuddy>我的出价和3个月前同样规格的房子的
<28-1,Cuddy>I offered exactly what a similar unit

768
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:38,680
<28-1,Cuddy>成交价是一样的
<28-1,Cuddy>Sold for three months ago.

769
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:43,730
<28-2,Wilson>我想捐我的肝给塔克
<28-2,Wilson>I want to donate a lobe of my liver to Tucker.

770
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:46,500
<28-3,Cuddy>你疯了吗
<28-3,Cuddy>That's insane.

771
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:49,690
<28-4,Wilson>我只是捐出一小部分...
<28-4,Wilson>I'm donating a small portion of...

772
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:51,690
<28-5,Cuddy>你有上百位病人
<28-5,Cuddy>You have hundreds of patients.

773
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,930
<28-6,Wilson>在捐完我所有多余的器官之前
<28-6,Wilson>And until I run out of excess organs,

774
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:56,290
<28-6,Wilson>我为什么不尽我所能地去帮助他们
<28-6,Wilson>Why shouldn't I do everything I can to help them?

775
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:59,110
<28-7,Cuddy>因为你是个医生  不是捐赠者
<28-7,Cuddy>Because you're a doctor, not a donor.

776
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:08,600
<28-8,Wilson>为什么让我做肿瘤科主任
<28-8,Wilson>Why did you make me the head of oncology?

777
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:10,750
<28-9,Cuddy>不是因为你的器官最多
<28-9,Cuddy>Not because you have the most organs.

778
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:14,820
<28-9,Cuddy>你考虑周到  富有爱心
<28-9,Cuddy>You're thoughtful, caring.

779
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,750
<28-10,Wilson>是啊  爱心
<28-10,Wilson>Yeah, caring.

780
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:20,350
<28-10,Wilson>在你衡量标准里是个优点  不是缺点
<28-10,Wilson>By your own criteria a strength and not a weakness.

781
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:21,930
<28-11,Cuddy>这是因你的内疚而生的想法
<28-11,Cuddy>This is coming out of guilt.

782
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:23,930
<28-12,Wilson>这是因友谊而生的
<28-12,Wilson>This is coming out of friendship.

783
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:25,830
<28-12,Wilson>我的朋友在死亡线边缘徘徊
<28-12,Wilson>I have a friend who's about to die.

784
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:29,600
<28-12,Wilson>而我有机会救他的命
<28-12,Wilson>And I have the opportunity to save his life.

785
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,260
<28-13,Cuddy>好吧
<28-13,Cuddy>Okay.

786
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:52,350
<29-1,Wilson>你可以叫我可怜虫  随你怎么看
<29-1,Wilson>Call me a doormat. Get it all out of your system...

787
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:53,490
<29-1,Wilson>但我要捐肝脏给他
<29-1,Wilson>But I'm doing it.

788
00:36:58,660 --> 00:36:59,460
<29-2,House>为何
<29-2,House>Why?

789
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:03,000
<29-3,Wilson>他是我的朋友
<29-3,Wilson>He's my friend.

790
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:04,890
<29-4,House>我也是你的朋友
<29-4,House>I'm your friend.

791
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:07,960
<29-4,House>想想我吃了那么多止疼片
<29-4,House>All the pain pills I've taken.

792
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:10,320
<29-4,House>要是我需要的肝呢
<29-4,House>What if I need your liver?

793
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,550
<29-5,Wilson>对啊  我怎么能这么自私
<29-5,Wilson>Right. How selfish of me not to have considered

794
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:14,940
<29-5,Wilson>没考虑到你未来的潜在需求
<29-5,Wilson>Your possible future needs.

795
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,440
<29-6,House>他们都病危了
<29-6,House>They're all dying.

796
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,500
<29-6,House>都是你的朋友
<29-6,House>They're all your friends.

797
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,500
<29-7,Wilson>我不是来找你吵架的  豪斯
<29-7,Wilson>I'm not here for an argument, House.

798
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,290
<29-8,House>不吵架  对啊  这里是12A办公室
<29-8,House>No. Right. That's room 12A.

799
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:24,450
<29-8,House>那你来这里干什么
<29-8,House>So why are you here?

800
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:26,780
<29-8,House>来确认我是不是叫了搬运车
<29-8,House>Want to make sure that I called the moving van?

801
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:32,700
<29-9,Wilson>不是  手术在二小时后进行
<29-9,Wilson>No. The operation is in two hours,

802
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,720
<29-9,Wilson>我希望你能陪我度过
<29-9,Wilson>And I'd like you to be there with me.

803
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:41,700
<29-10,House>不
<29-10,House>No.

804
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:45,600
<29-11,Wilson>怎...为什么
<29-11,Wilson>What...why?

805
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,330
<29-12,House>要是你不幸去世  我就孤独一人了
<29-12,House>Because if you die, I'm alone.

806
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,490
<29-12,House>谢谢  吉姆
<29-12,House>Thanks, Jim.

807
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:56,520
<30-1,Wilson>感觉怎么样
<30-1,Wilson>How are you feeling?

808
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:59,390
<30-2,Tucker>没什么可抱怨的  如果没有你
<30-2,Tucker>Can't complain considering if it weren't for you,

809
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:01,390
<30-2,Tucker>我已经在鬼门关走两回了
<30-2,Tucker>I'd be dead--twice.

810
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:04,400
<30-3,Wilson>-你呢  -我感觉不错
<30-3,Wilson>- You? - I feel good.

811
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:07,180
<30-3,Wilson>要把衣服送洗吗
<30-3,Wilson>Sending out your laundry?

812
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:11,200
<30-4,Tucker>我要去康复中心  在坎多纳市附近
<30-4,Tucker>Going to rehab. Some place up in Katonah.

813
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:15,500
<30-5,Wilson>在你的新房子附近  不挨着老房子
<30-5,Wilson>Up by your new house, not near your old house.

814
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:18,290
<30-6,Tucker>这样对阿什利方便一些
<30-6,Tucker>Easier on Ashley.

815
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:20,940
<30-7,Wilson>我明白了
<30-7,Wilson>I see.

816
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,090
<30-8,Tucker>之前我对于重组家庭很兴奋
<30-8,Tucker>I was thrilled to get the family back together

817
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:27,390
<30-8,Tucker>而且梅丽莎在危急关头是个好依靠
<30-8,Tucker>And Melissa's great in a crisis,

818
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:31,630
<30-8,Tucker>但是在病危时陪伴你的最佳伴侣
<30-8,Tucker>But the person you want when you're dying

819
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:34,310
<30-9,Ashley>不是现实生活时的最佳伴侣
<30-9,Ashley>Isn't the same as the person you want when you're living.

820
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:38,440
<30-9,Ashley>你好  吉姆
<30-9,Ashley>Hi, Jim.

821
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:42,750
<30-10,Wilson>实际上  我的名字是詹姆斯
<30-10,Wilson>Actually, it's James.

822
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:07,790
<31-1,House>你终于承认他是以自我为中心的混蛋了吧
<31-1,House>You ready to admit that he's a self-important jerk?

823
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:11,080
<31-2,Wilson>我不后悔做了捐献
<31-2,Wilson>I still feel good about what I did.

824
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,700
<31-3,House>你不生气吗
<31-3,House>You don't feel angry?

825
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:18,130
<31-4,Wilson>我是有点失望
<31-4,Wilson>Ah. I'm a little disappointed.

826
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:22,390
<31-5,House>失望就是软柿子的生气方式
<31-5,House>Disappointment is anger for wimps.

827
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:26,030
<31-5,House>你不用一直做老好人
<31-5,House>You don't have to be so gentle about everything.

828
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,900
<31-5,House>偶尔生个气也没什么
