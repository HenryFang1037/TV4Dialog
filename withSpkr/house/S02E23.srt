<2-13,Crandall>你总是说, 宁愿舍掉右手,只要能像他一样弹奏
<2-13,Crandall>You always said you'd give your,right hand to play like him.

00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:38,850
<2-14,House>没有, 我是说,愿用我的右手换他的左手
<2-14,House>No,I said I'd give my right,hand to have his left.

54
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:40,420
<2-14,House>她怎么和你在一块?
<2-14,House>Why is she with you?

55
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:44,200
<2-15,Crandall>她在 卡特琳娜飓风来袭时,失去了妈妈, 她的家, 一切
<2-15,Crandall>She lost her mom in katrina.,Her home,everything.

00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:49,350
<2-17,Crandall>我是她父亲
<2-17,Crandall>And I'm her father.

<2-18,House>唔. 是呀, 看起来可真像你,一样的黑人鬈曲发型
<2-18,House>Hmm.Yeah,she looks just like you.,Got the same 'fro.

<2-19,Crandall>我写了一本关于Baker的书,和他相处了一段, 还有她女儿
<2-19,Crandall>I wrote a book about baker.,Hung out with him.And his daughter.

59
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,560
<2-20,House>婴儿是这样制造的
<2-20,House>That is how babies are made.

00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,910
<2-21,Crandall>我一直不知道. 她也不知道
<2-21,Crandall>I never knew.She never knew.

<2-21,Crandall>她妈妈骗了我们16年
<2-21,Crandall>Her mom lied for 16 years.

62
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:10,880
<2-22,House>难以置信
<2-22,House>That's unbelievable.

63
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,150
<2-23,Crandall>是啊
<2-23,Crandall>Yeah.

64
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,440
<2-24,House>说真的, 我不信
<2-24,House>No,seriously.I don't believe it.

00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,940
<2-25,Crandall>她妈妈因我的书大怒,我把他们贬得一无是处
<2-25,Crandall>Her mom was pissed at me about my book.,I trashed her and her dad.

66
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,560
<2-25,Crandall>她不再和我说话,显然她也不会告诉Leona--
<2-25,Crandall>She wouldn't talk to me.,Obviously she's not gonna tell leona that--

67
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,800
<2-26,House>你是个笨蛋. 一直都是
<2-26,House>you're a sucker.You always were.

68
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,290
<2-27,Crandall>那是不是意味着你不会救她?
<2-27,Crandall>Does that mean you're not going to help her?

69
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,370
<2-28,House>为什么我不会?
<2-28,House>Why wouldn't I?

70
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:32,120
<2-28,House>她又没有诓骗我
<2-28,House>She's not scamming me.

71
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:40,330
<2-29,Chase>急性心肌梗塞?
<2-29,Chase>acute myocardial infarction?

72
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:42,650
<2-30,House>急救中心说不是的. 再查一次
<2-30,House>E.R. Said no.Retest.

73
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:44,060
<2-31,Cameron>预激综合征?(心房或心室某一部分提前激动)
<2-31,Cameron>Wolff-parkinson-white syndrome?

74
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:47,820
<2-32,House>急诊否定了. 再查,看看那该死的病历
<2-32,House>E.R. Said no.Retest.And read the damn file.

75
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,000
<2-33,Cameron>你刚给我们
<2-33,Cameron>You just gave them to us.

76
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,400
<2-34,Foreman>- 心电图显示δ波,- 全都不是
<2-34,Foreman>Delta wave on the ekg--it's all a no.

77
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:53,230
<2-35,House>关于她心脏的一切指数都很健康
<2-35,House>Everything about her heart is healthy.

78
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,310
<2-36,Cameron>她是卡特琳娜飓风的受害者
<2-36,Cameron>She's a katrina victim.

79
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:57,120
<2-37,House>她可比 Crandall 要幸运,他是飓风受害者的受骗者
<2-37,House>She's better than crandall.,He's a katrina victim victim.

80
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:59,260
<2-38,Chase>我不认为她想博得你的同情
<2-38,Chase>I don't think she was expecting yo sympathy.

81
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:02,300
<2-38,Chase>我想她的关键点是,新奥尔良就像一个第三世界国家
<2-38,Chase>I think her point was,,new orleans was a third-world country.

82
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:04,360
<2-38,Chase>街上到处都是毒素, 霉菌, 污水
<2-38,Chase>Toxins,molds,sewage in the streets.

83
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,640
<2-39,House>也许她的心脏就像我的摩托车?
<2-39,House>What if her heart is like my bike?

84
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:11,710
<2-39,House>我骑的时候, 废铜烂铁,一带到技师那里, 运转自如
<2-39,House>Runs like crap when I'm by myself,,but if I take it to the mechanic,it runs great.

85
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:14,240
<2-40,Foreman>心律不齐. 一次性的?
<2-40,Foreman>an arrhythmia.One-time event?

86
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,740
<2-41,Cameron>那我们怎么办?给她接上心脏监视器, 干等着
<2-41,Cameron>What are we going to do,,keep her in a room on a cardiac monitor until

87
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:19,900
<2-41,Cameron>直到另一次的心律不齐?那可能需要几星期, 甚至几个月
<2-41,Cameron>she has another arrhythmia?That could be weeks,months.

88
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:22,800
<2-42,House>放松点,我知道午饭后她就要来一次
<2-42,House>Relax.I happen to know,she's going to have one right after lunch.

89
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,240
<2-42,House>机会难得
<2-42,House>We are golden.

90
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:27,850
<2-43,Cameron>你不能给48小时前心脏差点衰竭的,病人再引导一次心律不齐
<2-43,Cameron>You can't induce an arrhythmia on someone,whose heart nearly gave out 48 hours ago.

91
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:28,970
<2-44,House>你当然可以
<2-44,House>Sure you can.

92
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:32,450
<2-44,House>技术活, 把很酷的细电线插入病人的心脏
<2-44,House>It's kind of technical,you stick all,these cool little wires inside r somehow.

93
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:34,080
<2-45,Cameron>我是说不该这么做
<2-45,Cameron>I mean you shouldn'T.

94
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,790
<2-46,House>噢, 是啊, 让病情不可控制地发作,会道德得多
<2-46,House>Oh,right,because it would be much more ethical,to let it happen in an uncontrolled setting.

95
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:42,310
<2-46,House>午饭时, 邻桌总会有一队心脏病专家,这里是新泽西州
<2-46,House>There's always a team of cardiologists,having lunch at the next table.This is jersey.

96
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,850
<2-46,House>她未成年. 需要监护人同意
<2-46,House>She's a minor.She's going to need consent.

98
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,690
<2-48,House>噢, 计划真是太妙了
<2-48,House>Oh,that's an excellent plan.

99
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:51,850
<2-48,House>给他一张表格, 告诉他那是,错误而危险的
<2-48,House>Give him the form and tell him,it's wrong and dangerous.

100
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,010
<2-49,Cameron>我能搞定一份简单的同意书
<2-49,Cameron>I can handle a simple consent form.

101
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:55,040
<8-3,House>好
<8-3,House>Okay.

102

<2-47,Cameron>开始
<2-47,Cameron>Go.

106
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:07,410
<2-53,Cameron>我得和你谈谈,打算对 Leona 实施的方案
<2-53,Cameron>I need to talk to you about a,procedure we'd like to do on leona.

<2-55,Cameron>他不是你. 他不会嘲笑我--
<2-55,Cameron>He's not you.He's not going to mock me--

112
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,710
<2-57,Cameron>为了查出哪个回路不起作用
<2-57,Cameron>In order to figure out which,circuit is misfiring,

113
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:21,950
<2-57,Cameron>得绘出心脏的每个心电活动
<2-57,Cameron>we need to map all the electrical,activity in her heart.

114
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:25,680
<2-58,House>手放在圣经上发誓,如果是你的孩子, 也会这么做

116
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,190
<2-57,Cameron>为了绘出她的心电通路
<2-57,Cameron>To map the electrical,pathways in her heart,

117
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:37,670
<3-1,House>对每个回路都给电,一次一个, 直到有一个失败
<3-1,House>we send electricity through each,,one at a time,until one fails.

118
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:39,010
<3-2,Crandall>听起来很危险

<3-3,House>这是我准备接受的风险
<3-3,House>It's a risk i am prepared to take.

120
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:45,330
<3-4,Crandall>如果她心电有问题,更多的电流不会摧毁整个系统吗?
<3-4,Crandall>If she's got an electrical problem,couldn't,more electricity blow her whole system?

121
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:49,600

<3-6,Crandall>I shouldn't do the test?

125
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,880
<3-7,House>其实极其危险

133
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,150
<3-12,Crandall>想想她都经历了什么,你怎么能猜测--
<3-12,Crandall>With what she's been through,,why would you assume--

134
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,570
<3-13,House>就是因为她经历了那些
<3-13,House>because of what she's been through.

135
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,230
<3-14,Crandall>因为那是你默认的姿态,一直都是
<3-14,Crandall>Because that's your default position.,Always has been.

136
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,250

<3-16,Crandall>我以为你已经没那么愤世
<3-16,Crandall>I figured you'd have mellowed.

139
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,060
<3-17,House>因为你是个白痴
<3-17,House>Because you're an idiot.

140
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:46,640
<3-18,Crandall>如果我让你做亲子鉴定,意味着我不信任她
<3-18,Crandall>If I let you do the test,,it means I don't trust her.

<7-15,House>心律不齐很疼
<7-15,House>Arrhythmia hurts.

<7-15,House>也许她得了病
<7-15,House>What if she has a disease

223
00:14:57,150 --> 00:15:01,550
<7-15,House>疼痛被转译成古怪的生理反应,好比幻觉?
<7-15,House>that translates pain into a bizarre,physiological response,like a hallucination?

224
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:04,420
<7-16,Cameron>她有自身免疫性疾病,要做C-反应蛋白, 类风湿因子--
<7-16,Cameron>She has an autoimmune disease.,She needs a crp,a rheumatoid factor--

225
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:07,490
<7-17,House>我能在5分钟里确诊一个自身免疫性疾病,做正电子发射层扫描 (pet scan)
<7-17,House>I can prove an autoimmune disease,in five minutes.She needs a pet scan.

226
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:08,900
<7-18,Foreman>自身免疫性疾病没这么快查出来
<7-18,Foreman>You can't test for autoimmune in--

227
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,940
<7-19,House>我来证明她的幻觉,是对于疼痛的连贯反映
<7-19,House>I'm proving that her hallucinations,are a consistent response to pain,

228
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:14,220
<7-19,House>就能证明她得了自身免疫性疾病
<7-19,House>which proves that she has an autoimmune disease.

229
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,860
<7-20,Cameron>你怎么来检测对于疼痛的反应？
<7-20,Cameron>How do you test someone's response to pain?

230
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:18,520
<7-21,House>简单. 弄疼她
<7-21,House>Easy.Hurt them.

231
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,530
<8-1,House>一点都不疼的
<8-1,House>It's not going to hurt at all.

232
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:26,880
<8-1,House>但得保证你不移动
<8-1,House>But we just need to make sure you don't move.

233
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:28,110
<8-2,Leona>我不动
<8-2,Leona>I won'T.

234
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,000
<8-3,House>好, 给我手臂
<8-3,House>Okay,give me your arm.

235
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,210
<8-3,House>要检查你肌肉的反应
<8-3,House>I need to check your muscle responses.

236
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,730
<8-3,House>好, 翻过来, 手掌朝上
<8-3,House>Okay,turn it over.Palm upward.

237
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:44,130
<8-3,House>还好么?
<8-3,House>Everything okay?

238
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,650
<8-4,Leona>是的
<8-4,Leona>Yeah.

239
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,120
<8-5,Crandall>- 哇!,- 这是干什么?
<8-5,Crandall>Ow!--What the hell was that?

240
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:49,520
<8-6,Foreman>诊断检查
<8-6,Foreman>diagnostic test.

241
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,650
<8-6,Foreman>大脑皮层灰质应答如常, 没有幻觉
<8-6,Foreman>Cerebral cortex responded normally.,She's not hallucinating.

242
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:55,470
<8-7,House>你知道他不是你父亲, 是吗?
<8-7,House>You know he's not your father,don't you?

243
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,600
<8-8,Leona>他是我父亲. 妈妈告诉我的
<8-8,Leona>He's my dad.Mama told me.

244
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:59,890
<8-9,House>对不起, 我不想伤害你的
<8-9,House>I'm sorry,I didn't mean to hurt you.

245
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:02,650
<8-10,Crandall>House, 别碰她
<8-10,Crandall>House,leave her alone.

246
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:05,100
<8-11,House>说吧, 你我都清楚, 这是诈骗
<8-11,House>Come on,we both know it's a hustle.

247
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,020
<8-11,House>墙壁合起来了？
<8-11,House>Are the walls closing in?

248
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:09,100
<8-12,Leona>没有. 你为什么这么做?
<8-12,Leona>No.Why are you doing this?

249
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,550
<8-13,House>蜘蛛从我鼻孔里爬出来?
<8-13,House>Spiders coming out of my nose?

250
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:11,390
<8-14,Leona>让我出去
<8-14,Leona>Let me out.

251
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:14,270
<8-15,Foreman>House, 检查结束. 背侧前额皮层--
<8-15,Foreman>House,the test is over.,Dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex--

252
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:15,640
<8-16,House>- 把手给我,- 不!
<8-16,House>give me your hand.--No!

253
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,290
<8-16,House>把手给我
<8-16,House>Give me your hand.

254
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,220
<8-17,Leona>放过他吧
<8-17,Leona>Forget him.

255
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:23,950
<8-18,House>他可不是完美的猎物,他曾经是完美猎物
<8-18,House>He's not the perfect mark because,he was the perfect mark.

256
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:26,090
<8-18,House>在你之前, 早有人跃跃欲试
<8-18,House>Plenty of people got there before you.

257
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:31,950
<8-18,House>他已经被用尽榨干了
<8-18,House>He's used up.Tainted.Pumped dry.

258
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,920
<8-19,Foreman>产生幻觉了
<8-19,Foreman>she's hallucinating.

259
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:42,580
<9-1,Cameron>她失去了一切. 还被拗断手指, 再创新低
<9-1,Cameron>she's lost everything.And you're,breaking fingers.A new low.

260
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:46,960
<9-2,House>为了诊断, 她需要疼痛,我也想弄疼她, 双赢
<9-2,House>Diagnoically,she needed to be hurt.,I wanted to hurt her.Win-win.

261
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:50,790
<9-2,House>我没有预见到触发幻觉的阈值
<9-2,House>What I didn't consider was a,threshold to trigger the hallucinations.

262
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:55,000
<9-2,House>不然的话, 我在刺她两下之前就拗手指了,刚才太残忍了
<9-2,House>Otherwise,I'd have done the finger-bending first,instead of stabbing her twice.That was cruel.

263
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,890
<9-3,Cameron>如果她的自身免疫性病已濒晚期,寻常的治疗无济于事
<9-3,Cameron>If her autoimmune disease is this advanced,,usual treatment's not going to help.

264
00:16:58,010 --> 00:16:59,980
<9-4,Foreman>都不知道她得了那一种自身免疫性疾病
<9-4,Foreman>We don't even know which,autoimmune disease she has.

265
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,120
<9-4,Foreman>也许是肌无力综合症, 也许是G型甲亢--
<9-4,Foreman>Could be lambert-eaton,could be graves--

266
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,440
<9-5,House>好主意, 一次屠杀殆尽
<9-5,House>good point.Let's kill them all at once.

267
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:06,100
<9-6,Cameron>唯一的办法是更换整个免疫系统
<9-6,Cameron>the only way to do that is to,replace her entire immune system.

268
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:08,260
<9-7,House>好主意, 就这么干
<9-7,House>Good point.Let's do that.

269
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:10,690
<9-8,Chase>骨髓移植需要精确的匹配
<9-8,Chase>Bone marrow transplant requires an exact match.

270
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:12,220
<9-8,Chase>Leona 没有同胞姐弟
<9-8,Chase>Leona has no siblings.

271
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:13,610
<9-8,Chase>好主意
<9-8,Chase>Good point.

272
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:17,940
<9-9,House>她孤苦无依. 整个世界举目无亲
<9-9,House>She's all alone,poor thing.,No one in the whole,wide world.

273
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:49,840
<10-1,Jesse Baker>我说过要校音的, 这个乐器校过了?
<10-1,Jesse Baker>I asked for this tuned.,Did you get this instrument tuned?

274
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:53,940
<10-2,Crandall>要是我女儿需要骨髓,你为什么查骨髓注册库?
<10-2,Crandall>If my daughter needs bone marrow,why are,you looking in a bone marrow registry?

275
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,250
<10-3,House>因为骨髓在那里保存
<10-3,House>Because that's where they keep the bone marrow.

276
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,670
<10-4,Crandall>我是她爸爸
<10-4,Crandall>I'm her father.

277
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:03,760
<10-5,House>一个无条件相信一切的人,怎么能当传记作家
<10-5,House>How does somebody who believes absolutely,anything become a nonfiction writer?

278
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:06,760
<10-6,Crandall>检查我的骨髓
<10-6,Crandall>Test my bone marrow.

279
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:10,080
<10-6,Crandall>故事会这样结束
<10-6,Crandall>Here's how this is going to end.

280
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:14,160
<10-7,House>一天, 你坐在电脑前, 写一本音乐小书
<10-7,House>One day,you'll be sitting at your computer,,writing one of your little music books,

281
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:18,220
<10-7,House>你女儿回家, 带来愤怒的大个子警察,把你扔进监狱
<10-7,House>and your daughter will come home with a big,,angry policemanwho'll throw you in jail

282
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,390
<10-7,House>因为, "爸爸碰了我小洞洞."
<10-7,House>because,"daddy touched my poozle."

283
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:21,260
<10-8,Crandall>查我吧
<10-8,Crandall>Test me.

284
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,970
<10-9,House>很乐意
<10-9,House>Happy to.

285
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:28,210
<10-10,Crandall>只是我的骨髓. 我不授权亲子鉴定
<10-10,Crandall>Just my marrow.,I'm not authorizing a paternity test.

286
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,040
<10-11,House>你害怕真相?
<10-11,House>You're that afraid of the truth?

287
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,150
<10-12,Crandall>我知道真相
<10-12,Crandall>I know the truth.

288
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:36,270
<10-13,House>小骚妖精的真相是,她需要张公车票回家看生病的祖母
<10-13,House>Easy lay fay's truth was that she needed,a bus ticket home to see her sick grandma.

289
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:38,570
<10-13,House>你给了她 100 块钱
<10-13,House>You gave her 100 bucks.

290
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:40,430
<10-13,House>她去买了大麻
<10-13,House>She bought weed.

291
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:44,250
<10-13,House>因为是我告诉她,你肯定会因为病奶奶的故事上当
<10-13,House>I know,because I told her you'd,go for the sick grandma story.

292
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,530
<10-14,Crandall>如果我们的友情对你还有意义--
<10-14,Crandall>If our friendship means anything to you--

293
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,660
<10-15,House>哦, 你真的了解我吗?
<10-15,House>oh,come on.Do you know me at all?

294
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:52,440
<10-16,Crandall>要是你做了亲子鉴定. 两个结果,要么你对, 要么我对
<10-16,Crandall>If you do the test,one of two things happens.,Either you're right or I'm right.

295
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:54,150
<10-16,Crandall>你对, 我很悲惨
<10-16,Crandall>If you're right,I'll be miserable.

296
00:18:54,220 --> 00:19:00,820
<10-16,Crandall>我对, 我会恨自己. 因为我不信任她,两者, 我皆输
<10-16,Crandall>And if I'm right,I'll hate myself,'cause I didn't trust her.Either way,I lose.

297
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:09,300
<11-1,Mother>不痒, 也不突起
<11-1,Mother>They don't itch.Not raised.

298
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:12,630
<11-1,Mother>他打过预防针了
<11-1,Mother>He's had his mmr.

299
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:15,510
<11-1,Mother>学校里没人生病, 爸爸带他去露营
<11-1,Mother>No one's sick at school.,His father took him camping.

300
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,380
<11-2,Son>我们捉到两只蜘蛛
<11-2,Son>We caught two spiders.

301
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,150
<11-3,Mother>你没告诉我蜘蛛的事
<11-3,Mother>You didn't tell me about the spiders.

302
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:20,180
<11-4,House>你有新的睡椅?
<11-4,House>Did you get a new couch?

303
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:22,930
<11-5,Mother>- 你觉得是不是什么毒素?- 什么颜色?
<11-5,Mother>Do you think there might,be some sort of toxin?--What color is it?

304
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,450
<11-7,Son>红的
<11-7,Son>Red.

305
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,900
<11-8,House>你洗完澡是不是趴着看卡通?
<11-8,House>Is that where you watch your,cartoons after you take your bath?

306
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:35,630
<11-10,House>有时候睡着了?
<11-10,House>Fall asleep sometimes?

307
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:37,000
<11-12,House>- 是的,- 保佑你
<11-12,House>Yes.--Bless you.

308
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,510
<11-13,Cuddy>需要你, 现在
<11-13,Cuddy>Need you.Now.

309
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:41,340
<11-14,House>是的, 夫人
<11-14,House>Yes,mistress.

310
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:47,900
<11-14,House>我开张处方, 一块这个, 弄湿了用
<11-14,House>I'll write you a prescription for,one of these.Just wet and apply.

311
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,320
<12-1,Cuddy>你没告诉任何人, 我想干什么?
<12-1,Cuddy>You didn't tell anyone else what I'm doing?

312
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,110
<12-2,House>一个都没有
<12-2,House>Not a soul.

313
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,950
<12-3,Cuddy>Wilson?
<12-3,Cuddy>Wilson?

314
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:06,270
<12-3,Cuddy>Cameron, 也许你跟她提过
<12-3,Cuddy>Cameron,maybe you mentioned it to her.

315
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:09,210
<12-4,House>不, 我是绝好的守密者
<12-4,House>No,I'm a really good secret-keeper.

316
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:12,320
<12-4,House>从没告诉任何人, wilson 尿床
<12-4,House>I never told anybody that wilson wets his bed.

317
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,630
<12-4,House>哦, 你套我的话
<12-4,House>Oh,you tricked me.

318
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:20,400
<12-5,Cuddy>体外受精的方法包括,一天两次注射尿促性素
<12-5,Cuddy>Part of the protocol for in vitro fertilization,is twice-daily injections of menotropins.

319
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:23,830
<12-5,Cuddy>我自己干不了
<12-5,Cuddy>I can't do it myself.

320
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,320
<12-6,House>转过身
<12-6,House>Turn around.

321
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,060
<12-7,Cuddy>对我弯下身不说点怪话?
<12-7,Cuddy>No clever comments about bending over?

322
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:34,070
<12-8,House>除非你想让我说
<12-8,House>Not unless you want me to.

323
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:38,770
<12-9,Cuddy>只是不太习惯专业操守的house
<12-9,Cuddy>I'm just not used to house the professional.

324
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:47,230
<12-10,House>我在想你妈妈长得什么样
<12-10,House>I was just thinking about what,your mother looked like.

325
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:49,710
<12-10,House>因为你爸爸明显因为繁衍需要选择她
<12-10,House>Since your father obviously chose,her for breeding purposes--

326
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:51,430
<12-11,Cuddy>闭嘴
<12-11,Cuddy>shut up.

327
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:54,050
<12-12,House>自然选择毫无道理
<12-12,House>Natural selection sucks.

328
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:57,790
<12-12,House>我们挑选配偶基于胸部的大小, 所开的车
<12-12,House>We pick our mates based on breast size,,cars they drive.

329
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:02,460
<12-12,House>对已婚夫妻的解剖发现,这些和胰腺的大小呈相关
<12-12,House>They did autopsies on married couples.,Found a correlation in pancreas size.

330
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:07,270
<12-12,House>本能驱使我们按照愚蠢的理由选择,你本可以有聪明的选择
<12-12,House>We're hard-wired to pick for stupid reasons.,You have the chance to pick for smart reasons.

331
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:11,140
<12-13,Cuddy>我想德国人有相近的理论, 大概在60年前
<12-13,Cuddy>I think the germans had a similar,theory about 60 years ago.

332
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:14,530
<12-14,House>我不是在鼓吹种族灭绝, 只是说
<12-14,House>I'm not advocating wiping out entire races.,I'm just saying,

333
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:18,640
<12-14,House>你不该随随便便和某个盛精子的塑料杯交配
<12-14,House>you don't want to mate with,the first plastic cup that buys you a drink.

334
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:22,170
<12-15,Cuddy>擦得差不多了吧
<12-15,Cuddy>I'm pretty sure you got that.

335
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:24,980
<12-16,House>细菌很鬼祟
<12-16,House>Microbes can be sneaky.

336
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,140
<12-17,Cuddy>谢谢
<12-17,Cuddy>Thanks.

<12-18,House>Twice a day.This is going to be fun.

338
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,480
<13-1,Wilson>我来好了
<13-1,Wilson>I got it.

339
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:10,180
<13-1,Wilson>你怎么会跟他成了朋友?
<13-1,Wilson>So why were you friends with this guy?

340
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:15,210
<13-2,House>我们20岁时, 他有一辆车
<13-2,House>We were 20 years old.He had a car.

341
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:18,850
<13-2,House>他要是个女人, 我都可能娶他
<13-2,House>If he'd been a woman,I would have married him.

342
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:22,530
<13-3,Wilson>- 他匹配吗?- 不
<13-3,Wilson>- Is he a match?- No.

343
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,830
<13-4,House>说谎的女孩子走运了,在骨髓库里发现一例匹配
<13-4,House>Lying girl lucked out.We found,one in the registry.

344
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,150
<13-5,Wilson>他是不是爸爸？
<13-5,Wilson>Is he the dad?

345
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,290
<13-7,Wilson>- 我认为不是,- 你没有做亲子鉴定？
<13-7,Wilson>- I don't think so.,- You didn't run the test?

346
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:34,990
<13-8,House>说过我不会做
<13-8,House>Said I wouldn'T.

347
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:39,590
<13-9,Wilson>好, 要么你说谎, 要么...
<13-9,Wilson>Okay.So either you lied,or he has...

348
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:42,650
<13-9,Wilson>他唤起了你的良知?
<13-9,Wilson>pictures of you being nice.

349
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,260
<13-10,House>停止放射
<13-10,House>Stop the radiation.

350
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:53,360
<13-11,Wilson>这究竟是什么?
<13-11,Wilson>What the hell is that?

351
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:57,770
<13-12,House>不知道
<13-12,House>I have no idea.

352
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:08,730
<14-1,Chase>对黑色渗出物的实验结果, 难以置信
<14-1,Chase>Lab results on the black ooze.,You're not gonna believe it.

353
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:10,960
<14-2,House>她从嘴里拉便便
<14-2,House>She pooped out of her mouth.

354
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,010
<14-3,Cameron>样本包含粪便, 经消化后的血液,你怎么猜到的?
<14-3,Cameron>The sample contains stool,and digested blood.How did you guess?

355
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:15,920
<14-4,House>因为它是慢慢渗出的
<14-4,House>Because it oozed.

356
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,580
<14-4,House>如果来自胃, 应该喷溅出
<14-4,House>If it was in her stomach,it would have sprayed.

357
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:22,550
<14-4,House>如果在肺里, 她该呛得咳嗽,这慢慢渗出, 如同受挤压, 反向蠕动
<14-4,House>If it was in her lungs,she would have coughed.,This oozed,as in squeezed,as in reverse peristalsis.

358
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:24,450
<14-4,House>有谁饿了吗? 墨西哥菜外卖?
<14-4,House>Who's hungry?Mexican takeout?

359
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:28,010
<14-5,Chase>消化后血液在她小肠里的话,她应该有内出血
<14-5,Chase>In order for digested blood to be in her,intestines,she had to have internal bleeding.

360
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:31,050
<14-6,Cameron>不论肠道有什么东西反涌, 下面必定梗阻了
<14-6,Cameron>Order for whatever was in her intestines,to come back up,there had to be a blockage.

361
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:35,490
<14-7,Foreman>肝功能衰竭. 没有使血液凝结的蛋白质,因此渗进她的胃, 搞一团糟
<14-7,Foreman>liver failure.There'd be no proteins to clot the blood,,so it'd leak into her stomach,mess up her intestines.

362
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:39,830
<14-8,House>说明, 啊, 错了,没有一种自体免疫病能在2小时内关闭器官
<14-8,House>Which means,oops,we were wrong.Because no,autoimmune disease shuts down an organ in two hours.

363
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:43,420
<14-8,House>要做一个肝脏活组织检查,找出真正问题所在
<14-8,House>We need to do a liver biopsy,,find out what the real problem is.

364
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,770
<14-8,House>嘿. 要跟你谈一下
<14-8,House>Hey.Need to talk to you.

365
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:10,790
<15-1,House>好消息是, 她没有自身免疫的情形
<15-1,House>The good news is,she doesn't,have an autoimmune condition,

366
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:15,480
<15-1,House>所以她不需要骨髓移植, 放射也及时停止
<15-1,House>so she doesn't need a bone marrow transplant,,and we were able to stop the irradiation in time.

367
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:19,110
<15-1,House>坏消息是, 她嘴里排便
<15-1,House>Bad news,she has potty mouth.

368
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:23,940
<15-1,House>肝脏衰竭, 使得消化系统颠倒
<15-1,House>Her liver is failing,which has made,her digestive system go in reverse.

369
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,930
<15-1,House>比听上去要严重得多
<15-1,House>It's actually much worse than it sounds.

370
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:32,950
<15-1,House>需要做肝脏活组织检查
<15-1,House>We need to do a liver biopsy.

371
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:37,720
<15-1,House>我不知会怎么样, 当把针插入她的肝脏
<15-1,House>I don't know what's going to happen,when we stick a needle into her liver.

372
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:40,730
<15-1,House>她可能会当场死亡
<15-1,House>She could die right then and there.

373
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:43,660
<15-2,Crandall>你得告诉我该怎么做
<15-2,Crandall>You need to tell me what to do.

374
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:47,390
<15-3,House>对此没有内部消息
<15-3,House>No inside information on thione.

375
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:53,300
<15-3,House>Crandall, 三天前, 你还不认识这女孩
<15-3,House>Crandall,three days ago,,you didn't even know this girl.

376
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,990
<15-3,House>她可能遭遇车祸, 你不会因此失眠
<15-3,House>If she'd been hit by a bus,,you wouldn't lose a moment's sleep.

377
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:05,120
<15-3,House>医院里满是同样困扰重重,同样和你没有血缘的人
<15-3,House>There are people all over this hospital in just,as much trouble,and just as not related to you.

378
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,810
<15-4,Crandall>你说我不应该在乎?
<15-4,Crandall>You telling me i shouldn't care?

379
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:11,520
<15-4,Crandall>为她死时, 做好心理准备?
<15-4,Crandall>Prepping me to handle it for when she dies?

380
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:39,660
<15-4,Crandall>棕色, 结块的
<15-4,Crandall>It's brown,it's lumpy.

381
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,860
<16-1,House>我要吐一桌子了
<16-1,House>I'm going to heave all over my desk.

382
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:44,710
<16-2,Wilson>鸡汁?
<16-2,Wilson>Chicken mol?

383
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:47,430
<16-2,Wilson>含21种草本和香料
<16-2,Wilson>21 herbs and spices.

384
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:51,210
<16-2,Wilson>我觉得很安慰
<16-2,Wilson>I find it very comforting,

385
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:54,520
<16-2,Wilson>你在保护一个多年未见的人
<16-2,Wilson>you defending a man you haven't seen in years.

386
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:58,510
<16-2,Wilson>知道我的朋友, 无论如何,他都会是我的战士, 我的守护者
<16-2,Wilson>To know my friend,no matter what,,will always be my champion.My protector.

387
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:00,940
<16-3,House>我不是在保护他, 是在打击她
<16-3,House>I'm not protecting him,I'm smacking her.

388
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,370
<16-4,Wilson>谦逊的真心英雄
<16-4,Wilson>The modesty of a true hero.

389
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:05,530
<16-5,House>再逼我, 我就弄死她,你就不能嘲弄我了
<16-5,House>Push me and I'll let her die,,just so you'll stop annoying me.

390
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:09,210
<16-6,Wilson>我的理论是, 你妒嫉了
<16-6,Wilson>Here's my theory.You're jealous.

391
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:14,020
<16-6,Wilson>他成熟了, 在担负责任,而你在情感上, 停留在了17岁
<16-6,Wilson>He's maturing,he's accepting responsibility,,you're emotionally stuck at 17.

392
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:17,560
<16-7,House>他在制造责任, 他不是成熟了
<16-7,House>He's manufacturing responsibility,,he's not maturing.

393
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:20,140
<16-7,House>他一点都没有变
<16-7,House>He hasn't changed at all.

394
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:22,450
<16-8,Wilson>那么, 你为什么在乎?
<16-8,Wilson>So then,why do you care?

395
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:25,000
<16-9,House>看到的黑色渗出物?
<16-9,House>That black ooze we saw?

396
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,500
<16-9,House>是肠子的排泄物
<16-9,House>That was a bowel movement.

397
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:30,570
<16-9,House>从她嘴里出来
<16-9,House>Out of her mouth.

398
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:33,600
<16-10,Wilson>你想让我恶心, 来结束谈话?
<16-10,Wilson>You're trying to end,this conversation by grossing me out?

399
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:38,370
<16-10,Wilson>我是肿瘤学家,我一半的病人皮肤腐败
<16-10,Wilson>I'm an oncologist.,Half my patients have their skin sloughing off.

400
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:42,170
<16-10,Wilson>你为何担心这个男人?
<16-10,Wilson>Why are you so worried about this guy?

401
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:45,890
<16-11,House>他和女朋友曾有一段关系紧张
<16-11,House>He was having a rough time with his girlfriend.

402
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,680
<16-11,House>他陷在爱里, 他总是爱着
<16-11,House>He was in love.He was always in love.

403
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:53,980
<16-11,House>想要娶她, 我觉得她不可靠
<16-11,House>Wanted to marry her.I thought she was flaky.

404
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:56,640
<16-11,House>她模棱两可
<16-11,House>She was sending mixed signals.

405
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,840
<16-12,Wilson>所以你给他出主意, 导致他被甩?
<16-12,Wilson>So you gave him advice and she dumped him.

406
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:04,780
<16-13,House>不, 我说我去和她谈谈
<16-13,House>No,I told him that i would talk to her.

407
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,210
<16-14,Wilson>可你搞砸了
<16-14,Wilson>And you blew it?

408
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:10,490
<16-15,House>技术上讲... (反过来),( "blew" 搞砸, 口交, 双关)
<16-15,House>Technically...

409
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:16,940
<16-15,House>我那是帮他, 她是个蠢女人
<16-15,House>I was doing him a favor.She was nuts.

410
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,450
<17-1,Foreman>停止活组织检查
<17-1,Foreman>Stop the biopsy.

411
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,530
<17-2,Chase>马上就到肝脏了
<17-2,Chase>I'm right at her liver.

412
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:23,300
<17-3,Foreman>是House, 他说停止
<17-3,Foreman>It's house.He says stop.

413
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:31,250
<18-1,House>听听这个
<18-1,House>Check it out.

414
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:35,000
<18-2,Foreman>千万别告诉我停止切片检查,是为了播放乐曲
<18-2,Foreman>Please tell me you didn't stop,the biopsy to play us some tunes.

415
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,460
<18-3,House>左手, 多么微妙, 多么精巧
<18-3,House>The left hand.It's very subtle.,Very delicate.

416
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:41,220
<18-4,Cameron>那女孩快死了
<18-4,Cameron>This girl is dying.

417
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:46,080
<18-5,House>做那个明显无用的切片检查,死得更快, 仔细听
<18-5,House>Be dying a lot faster if I let you do,that obviously unnecessary biopsy.Now listen.

418
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,760
<18-6,Jesse Baker>我说了让人来调一下音, 调了没有?
<18-6,Jesse Baker>I asked for this tuned.,Did you get this tuned?

419
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,810
<18-7,Foreman>我的天, 外公是个狂怒的醉鬼,不说我还真不知道
<18-7,Foreman>My god,grandpa was an angry drunk.,If only we'd known.

420
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:54,710
<18-8,House>伟大的艺术家是这样修炼的
<18-8,House>Here's how to become a great artist.

421
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:57,110
<18-8,House>首先, 生活凄惨
<18-8,House>First,get miserable.

422
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,250
<18-8,House>凄惨可以使你成为伟大的艺术家
<18-8,House>Misery drives you to become a great artist,

423
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:01,910
<18-8,House>但艺术无法改善凄惨, 逼你吸毒
<18-8,House>but the art does nothing for your misery,,which drives you to drugs,

424
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:05,150
<18-8,House>让你变成差劲的艺术家,但这一段并不差劲
<18-8,House>which makes you a lousy artist.,And this is not lousy.

425
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,930
<18-9,Chase>你说他没有吸毒?
<18-9,Chase>You saying he didn't do drugs?

426
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:10,260
<18-10,House>演奏这段时没有
<18-10,House>Not when he played this.

427
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:13,240
<18-10,House>有什么扭曲了他的性格
<18-10,House>Something was screwing with his personality.

428
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,890
<18-11,Foreman>毒品和酒不能起到这个作用?
<18-11,Foreman>Yeah,drugs and alcohol don't do that?

429
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:18,880
<18-12,House>他说走调的那个音并没有走调
<18-12,House>And that note that he says is out of tune,,it's not.

430
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,690
<18-12,House>这说明有东西同时扭曲了他的听觉
<18-12,House>Which means that something is screwing,with his aural perception too.

431
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:26,320
<18-12,House>结合这些, 再加上导致他死亡的肝病,有什么结论?
<18-12,House>Now,what happens when you add all of that to,the liver disease which he supposedly died of?

432
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,320
<18-13,Cameron>铁元素过量, 他可能患有血色病,(影响铁的新陈代谢) 遗传性疾病
<18-13,Cameron>Too much iron.He could have had hemochromatosis.,That's genetic.

433
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,950
<18-14,Foreman>难道 Miles Davis (现代爵士乐巨擘),磕药后就不会演奏...
<18-14,Foreman>Unless you can tell me miles,davis couldn't play stoned--

434
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:33,720
<18-15,House>不磕药, 演奏得更好
<18-15,House>he played better when he wasn'T.

435
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,170
<18-15,House>我猜的, 没人能确定
<18-15,House>I think--I mean,no one knows for sure.

436
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:38,560
<18-16,Cameron>我给 Leona 做总铁结合量以及,血清铁蛋白检查
<18-16,Cameron>I'll get leona a tibc and serum ferritin.

437
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:41,010
<18-17,House>三分钟就可以检查出来了
<18-17,House>We can test this in three minutes.

438
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:53,380
<19-1,House>她是哪种人? Foreman?
<19-1,House>So,what is she,foreman?

439
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:56,550
<19-1,House>较白的黑人还是较黑的白人?
<19-1,House>Light-skinned black chick or,dark-skinned white chick?

440
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:58,940
<19-2,Foreman>不能肯定, 再听一遍音乐会有提示么?
<19-2,Foreman>Not sure.,Can we hear the music again?

441
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:01,010
<19-3,Chase>病情早期还看不到黄疸
<19-3,Chase>it's too early to see jaundice from her liver.

442
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:05,230
<19-4,House>没错, 这是Leona13岁时的照片
<19-4,House>True--this is a photograph of,leona when she was 13 years old.

443
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:06,660
<19-4,House>现在更黑了
<19-4,House>She's darker now.

444
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:09,070
<19-5,Cameron>她在街上住了8个月
<19-5,Cameron>she's been living on,the streets for eight months.

445
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:15,820
<19-6,House>没有晒过的痕迹,,除非她住的是条室内大街
<19-6,House>No tan line,so unless those streets,she's been living on are indoor streets,

446
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:18,490
<19-6,House>我认为她铁元素和黑色素沉积过多
<19-6,House>I'm thinking she's got iron,deposits and melanin.

447
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:22,590
<19-6,House>两者都是血色病的并发症,就和他外公一样
<19-6,House>Both by-products of hemochromatosis,,just like granddad used to make.

448
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:27,080
<19-6,House>超导量子干涉磁化仪可以,测量血液中的铁元素含量
<19-6,House>Squid exam to calculate the,amount of iron in her blood.

449
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:30,570
<19-6,House>注射排铁络合剂, 她中饭前就会好的
<19-6,House>Then treat her with deferoxamine.,She'll be fine by lunch.

450
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:35,010
<19-6,House>瞧, 我之前说错了,关于早饭前会好的
<19-6,House>See,I was wrong before,,about the breakfast.

451
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:57,230
<20-1,Foreman>发现铁元素了, 很多很多
<20-1,Foreman>there's the iron.Lots of it.

452
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,790
<20-1,Foreman>我得不到这份工作了, 是吧?
<20-1,Foreman>I'm not going to get this job,am I?

453
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:09,130
<21-1,Patrick>早定了, 我第一眼看到你就决定了
<21-1,Patrick>It's a done deal.,I knew it the moment I saw you.

454
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:11,480
<21-2,House>面试只是形式主义
<21-2,House>Interview's just a formality.

455
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,160
<21-3,Cuddy>House, 你在...
<21-3,Cuddy>house.What are you--

456
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,480
<21-4,House>这是Lisa Cuddy, 这是Patrick Linehan
<21-4,House>lisa cuddy,this is patrick linehan.

457
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:18,350
<21-4,House>Patrick是新的实习生, 轮转到我的部门
<21-4,House>Patrick's going to be the new intern,rotating in my department.

458
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:21,190
<21-5,Cuddy>我都不知道你在招人,很高兴见到你
<21-5,Cuddy>I didn't even know you were looking for one.,Nice to meet you.

459
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:25,970
<21-6,Patrick>失礼了, 我紧张的时候就会笑
<21-6,Patrick>Sorry,I laugh when I'm nervous.

460
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:29,790
<21-7,House>赌你这辈子一直都是这样的, 对吧?
<21-7,House>Bet you've been doing that your whole life,,huh?

461
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:32,890
<21-8,Cuddy>对哪个学科感兴趣, Patrick?
<21-8,Cuddy>What kind of medicine are you interested in,,patrick?

462
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:37,020
<21-9,Patrick>癌症, 传染性疾病, 疑难杂症
<21-9,Patrick>Cancer,infectious disease.The big devils.

463
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:41,170
<21-9,Patrick>我觉得现在的医学过于机械化了
<21-9,Patrick>I think that medicine has become,too institutionalized.

464
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:44,830
<21-9,Patrick>应该传递给病人这样的信息,我们和他们一样
<21-9,Patrick>We need to send a message to our,patients that we're just like them.

465
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:47,800
<21-9,Patrick>我是说, 我们都是人
<21-9,Patrick>I mean,we're all people.

466
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:51,790
<21-10,House>"我们都是人" 我喜欢
<21-10,House>"We're all people."I like that.

467
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:57,330
<21-10,House>她只认科学, 事实
<21-10,House>She's all hard science,facts.

468
00:31:57,330 --> 00:32:00,270
<21-10,House>我喜欢了解他人的希望和梦想
<21-10,House>I like to know a person's hopes and dreams.

469
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:01,410
<21-10,House>你喜欢哪种音乐, Patrick?
<21-10,House>What kind of music do you like,patrick?

470
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:03,570
<21-12,Patrick>-事实上, 我...,-我喜欢莫扎特
<21-12,Patrick>- Actually,I--,- I'm a mozart man.

471
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:06,950
<21-12,Patrick>他说出了我能感受, 但无法表达的
<21-12,Patrick>He says what I feel,but can't express.

472
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:11,240
<21-13,Cuddy>我开会要迟到了
<21-13,Cuddy>I'm late for a meeting.

473
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:14,760
<21-14,House>看, 这就是面对面交谈为何如此重要
<21-14,House>see,this is why the face-to-face,interview is so important.

474
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:17,360
<21-14,House>得清楚你将和谁上床
<21-14,House>You gotta know who you're,getting in bed with.

475
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,510
<21-15,Cuddy>让他出去
<21-15,Cuddy>Get him out of here.

476
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:36,490
<21-15,Cuddy>排铁剂是一种螯合剂
<21-15,Cuddy>Deferoxamine is a chelating agent.

477
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:40,770
<21-15,Cuddy>和铁元素结合,就能从肝脏中分离出来了
<21-15,Cuddy>It binds to the iron so that,her liver can get rid of it.

478
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:45,580
<21-15,Cuddy>一旦铁元素分离出肝脏,最终会以尿液的形式排出体外
<21-15,Cuddy>Once the iron's out of the liver,it's finally,evacuated by the body in the form of urine.

479
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:48,700
<22-1,Crandall>很快也没有痛苦
<22-1,Crandall>Should be quick and painless.

480
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:11,320
<22-2,Chase>-Leona? 急救车,-怎么了?
<22-2,Chase>- Leona? Crash cart.,- What's happening?

481
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,620
<22-2,Chase>她无法呼吸了
<22-2,Chase>She's not getting any air.

482
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,360
<22-3,Chase>CT照片上她的肺就像瑞士奶酪
<22-3,Chase>ct showed her lungs are swiss cheese.

483
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:41,360
<22-3,Chase>呼吸器在起作用, 不过照这个趋势,她的时间所剩无几了
<22-3,Chase>Ventilator's helping,but at this rate,,her time's basically up.

484
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:45,420
<22-4,House>我们得出一个理论, 血色病
<22-4,House>We developed a theory.Hemochromatosis.

485
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:48,880
<22-4,House>如同称职的科学家,,我们测试并证明了这个理论
<22-4,House>Like good scientists,we tested that theory.,We proved that theory.

486
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,740
<22-4,House>在此基础上进行治疗
<22-4,House>We acted based on that proof,and we treated her.

487
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:54,970
<22-4,House>可结果却是, 她一脚踏进了鬼门关
<22-4,House>As a result of which,she is on the verge of death.

488
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:58,240
<22-4,House>是我的错?还是我们发现这科学方法中的缺陷?
<22-4,House>Is it just me,or have we discovered,a flaw in the scientific method?

489
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,780
<22-4,House>从头开始, 一步步考虑,,注射排铁剂时会怎样?
<22-4,House>Walk me through it,step by step.What is,supposed to happen when you give someone deferoxamine?

490
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:04,430
<22-5,Cameron>这是种螯合剂
<22-5,Cameron>It's a chelating agent.

491
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:05,400
<22-6,House>螯合剂如何起作用?
<22-6,House>And what does the chelating do?

492
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,180
<22-7,Chase>- 从肝脏中排出铁元素,- 怎么排出?
<22-7,Chase>- Removes excess iron from the liver.--,- How?

493
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:10,890
<22-8,House>铁很重, 会卡住,排铁剂就像是润滑剂
<22-8,House>The iron is heavy.It gets stuck.,Deferoxamine is like a lubricant.

494
00:34:10,890 --> 00:34:13,540
<22-9,Chase>使铁润滑, 就能再次移动
<22-9,Chase>It makes the iron slick so it,can move around again.

495
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:14,900
<22-10,House>移动到哪?
<22-10,House>Moves around where?

496
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:18,050
<22-11,Chase>应该和排泄物一起泻出
<22-11,Chase>It's supposed to be discharged through waste.

497
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:21,100
<22-12,House>她的排泄系统情况有点糟糕
<22-12,House>Her waste system is a little screwy right now.

498
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:24,140
<22-12,House>铁没办法到它想去的地方
<22-12,House>Means the iron can't go where it wants to go.

499
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:26,250
<22-12,House>如果移动到肺部?
<22-12,House>What if it moved to her lungs?

500
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:30,050
<22-13,Foreman>肺部有什么亲铁性物质,和铁结合, 开始在肺里穿洞
<22-13,Foreman>and whatever's in her lungs likes iron,,bound with it,started poking holes.

501
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:31,710
<22-14,House>有哪些亲铁物质?
<22-14,House>What likes iron?

502
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:34,730
<22-15,Chase>氧和铁自动结合, 提高了感染的几率
<22-15,Chase>Oxygen attaches itself to iron,,which increases her chance of infection.

503
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:37,600
<22-16,Foreman>不可能, 在放射之前我们,用了大量的抗生素
<22-16,Foreman>No,we started massive,antibiotics prior to the radiation.

504
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,430
<22-17,Cameron>一些神经退化类疾病亲和铁
<22-17,Cameron>Some neurodegenerative diseases like iron.

505
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:41,680
<22-18,Chase>核磁共振成像没有发现脑部有铁沉积
<22-18,Chase>Mri was clean.No iron deposits on the brain.

506
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,040
<22-19,Foreman>真菌也亲铁
<22-19,Foreman>Fungus likes iron.

507
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:47,460
<22-20,House>没有反对意见?
<22-20,House>No objections to that one?

508
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,450
<22-21,Chase>如果是真菌感染, 那她死定了
<22-21,Chase>if a fungus is doing all this,she's dead.

509
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:51,790
<22-21,Chase>有25种抗真菌药,要是不知道是哪种真菌...
<22-21,Chase>There are 25 antifungals.,If we don't know which fungus--

510
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:54,700
<22-22,House>- 有疑问的时候, 扩展思维,- 最通常的是曲霉菌
<22-22,House>- when in doubt,go broad.,- The most common is aspergillus.

511
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:56,610
<22-24,House>继续用呼吸机
<22-24,House>Continue to ventilate her lungs.

512
00:34:56,610 --> 00:35:00,900
<22-24,House>给她用伏立康唑滴液, 希望是曲霉菌吧
<22-24,House>Get her on a voriconazole drip,and hope she has aspergillus.

513
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:12,520
<23-1,Cuddy>过程是保密的, 你侵犯了他的隐私权,可你怎么能...
<23-1,Cuddy>The process is confidential.,You violated his privacy.How did you even--

514
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:15,400
<23-2,House>我在冷藏精子库里找 "失败者"
<23-2,House>I looked up "loser" in the cryobank.

515
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:20,150
<23-2,House>那个白痴周围100英里, 你都不想走近,却愿意和他生孩子
<23-2,House>You wouldn't go within 100 miles of that idiot,,and yet you're willing to have his baby.

516
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:23,220
<23-3,Cuddy>我不是想要约会, 我找累了...
<23-3,Cuddy>I'm not looking for a date.,I'm tired of looking--

517
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:28,930
<23-4,House>要棉球么?
<23-4,House>Cotton ball?

518
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,790
<23-4,House>你嫁给他我可不管
<23-4,House>I don't care if you marry this guy,

519
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:34,920
<23-4,House>和他约会, 检查他的垃圾,但你必须知道
<23-4,House>date this guy,go through his garbage,,but you should know.

520
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:38,200
<23-4,House>基因要紧, 找对人很重要
<23-4,House>Genes matter.Who you are matters.

521
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,700
<23-6,House>找个你信任的人吧
<23-6,House>Find someone you trust.

522
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,920
<23-5,Cuddy>和你相像的人?
<23-5,Cuddy>Someone like you?

523
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:47,880
<23-6,House>你喜欢的人
<23-6,House>Someone you like.

524
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:57,060
<23-6,House>听着, 哦, 我很抱歉, 好么
<23-6,House>Listen.Uh,sorry.Okay.

525
00:35:57,810 --> 00:36:00,400
<23-6,House>- 不是你想的那样,- 我在帮他揉腿
<23-6,House>- It's not what you think.--,- I rub his leg.

526
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,690
<24-1,Wilson>哦, Ingrid, 你好
<24-1,Wilson>Oh,ingrid.Hi.

527
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,660
<24-3,Ingrid>好吧
<24-3,Ingrid>Okay,

528
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:09,510
<24-4,Wilson>偷了他女友, 使你感到罪恶,我明白, 让我欣慰, 是件好事
<24-4,Wilson>you feel guilty about stealing the guy's girl.,I get that,and I'm glad.It's a good thing.

529
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:12,020
<24-4,Wilson>但你做了亲子鉴定
<24-4,Wilson>But you did the paternity test.

530
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:16,310
<24-4,Wilson>要么亲子鉴定呈不吻合,你可以在他面前挥舞结果
<24-4,Wilson>And either the paternity test comes back,negative,and you shove it in the guy's face,

531
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:21,340
<24-4,Wilson>要么鉴定吻合, 你闭上你的嘴,腿开始疼痛
<24-4,Wilson>or it comes back positive,and you shut up,,and your leg starts hurting.

532
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:23,870
<24-5,House>要么我没进行测试
<24-5,House>Or I never ran the test.

533
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:26,820
<24-5,House>- 和你想的不一样,- Leona的肺衰竭了
<24-5,House>- Not what you think.,- leona's lungs collapsed.

534
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:30,310
<24-6,Cameron>治疗没有作用, 猜错真菌了
<24-6,Cameron>The treatment's not working.,We've got the wrong fungus.

535
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:33,990
<24-7,House>可以停下了, 被她破坏了
<24-7,House>You can stop.She ruined it.

536
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:39,310
<24-8,House>找对真菌有三条规则,地点, 地点, 地点
<24-8,House>Three rules for hunting fungus.,Location,location,location.

537
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:42,740
<24-9,Chase>Crandall 说她住在 Ridgeland 的,儿童庇护所里
<24-9,Chase>Crandall says she was living at,the children's shelter in ridgeland.

538
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:47,340
<24-10,House>可以确信她没有住在,Ridgeland 的儿童庇护所里
<24-10,House>Okay,the one thing we know for sure is she was,not living at the children's shelter in ridgeland.

539
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:49,050
<24-11,Foreman>他为什么要撒谎?
<24-11,Foreman>Why would he lie about that?

540
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:50,190
<24-11,Foreman>他没有
<24-11,Foreman>he wouldn'T.

541
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:53,140
<24-12,House>他相信乖女孩行动正确的故事
<24-12,House>But he'd believe her story about the sweet,little girl trying to do the right thing.

542
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:55,910
<24-13,Cameron>我们没法问Leona住哪, 她喉咙插管
<24-13,Cameron>We can't ask leona where she was,,she's intubated.

543
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,560
<24-13,Cameron>别试着说话
