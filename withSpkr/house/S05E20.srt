<20-5,Wilson>Shame? Fear? Are you okay?

331
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:35,470
<20-5,Wilson>你觉得难过也没关系的
<20-5,Wilson>It's okay not to be okay.

332
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:39,480
<20-6,House>"殖民军战士镭射枪 编号11"
<20-6,House>"Colonial warriorabcblaster. Number one one."

333
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:45,820
<20-6,House>肯定是花几个月淘来的abc说明他对生活很有热情
<20-6,House>He'd have spent months trackingabcthis down. He had passions.

334
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:49,260
<20-7,Wilson>显然他正陷于痛苦
<20-7,Wilson>He was obviously in pain.

335
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:51,960
<20-7,Wilson>原因真的那么重要吗?
<20-7,Wilson>Does it really matter why?

336
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:56,410
<20-8,House>他把好的和不好的回忆挂在一起
<20-8,House>He hung the bad with the good.

337
00:22:56,420 --> 00:23:00,290
<20-8,House>失去的和得到的并排放
<20-8,House>His loss beside aabcreminder of what he'd gained.

338
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:04,220
<20-8,House>说明他对痛苦很看得开
<20-8,House>Means he was open about the pain.

339
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:08,420
<20-8,House>如果痛苦加深 他没理由会隐瞒
<20-8,House>Should mean that if it gotabcworse,he had no reason to hide it.

340
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:14,440
<20-9,Wilson>接下来这么办吧 House
<20-9,Wilson>Here's how we're gonna handle this,house.

341
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:19,570
<20-9,Wilson>我们离开这里 找间最近的酒吧abc边喝酒边聊天
<20-9,Wilson>We're gonna leave here and go to theabcclosest bar and drink and tell stories

342
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:23,020
<20-9,Wilson>聊聊Kutner当初怎么差点把手术室炸了
<20-9,Wilson>about the timeabckutner almost blew up an O.R.

343
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:26,200
<20-9,Wilson>发发牢骚 大醉一场
<20-9,Wilson>And pass out in our own sick.

344
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:29,480
<20-9,Wilson>这主意不错吧?
<20-9,Wilson>Sound like a plan?

345
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,750
<20-10,House>我漏掉了什么?
<20-10,House>What am I missing?

346
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:59,890
<20-10,House>你这副表情又来了
<20-10,House>You've got that look.

347
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:02,780
<20-10,House>你又看出什么了
<20-10,House>You figured this out.

348
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:05,900
<20-11,Wilson>你来这里 不是因为你关心Kutner
<20-11,Wilson>You're not here because youabccare about kutner.

349
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,880
<20-11,Wilson>而是因为这是一个谜
<20-11,Wilson>You're here because it's a mystery.

350
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:10,640
<20-11,Wilson>你要解开这个谜题
<20-11,Wilson>You're here for the puzzle.

351
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,820
<20-12,House>会不会是 不是我漏了什么...
<20-12,House>What if I didn't miss anything...

352
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:16,800
<20-12,House>而是根本没什么可遗漏的?
<20-12,House>'cause there's nothing to miss?

353
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:24,200
<20-12,House>他并不是自杀 而是被人谋杀
<20-12,House>He didn't kill himself. He was murdered.

354
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:45,110
<21-1,Taub>会厌肌肉 脾脏 现在轮到肝
<21-1,Taub>Epiglottis muscle,spleen,andabcnow her liver,

355
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:48,810
<21-1,Taub>只剩余20%功能 仍在加速恶化
<21-1,Taub>which is operating atabc20% and deteriorating fast.

356
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,320
<21-2,Thirteen>自体免疫性肝炎?
<21-2,Thirteen>Autoimmune hepatitis?

357
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:51,300
<21-2,Thirteen>你呼Foreman了没?
<21-2,Thirteen>Did you page foreman?

358
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:53,710
<21-3,House>他接受了Cuddy让他休假的建议
<21-3,House>Took up cuddy's offer of time off.

359
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,950
<21-3,House>甲状腺激素水平正常 说明不是肝炎
<21-3,House>Normal thyroid means no hepatitis.

360
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:59,170
<21-4,Taub>可能是淀粉样变性abc淀粉堵塞攻击器官 组织--
<21-4,Taub>Could be amyloidosis. Amyloidabcbuildup hits the organs,tissue--

361
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:01,020
<21-5,House>解释不了肌肉萎缩
<21-5,House>Her muscles wouldn't have atrophied.

362
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,740
<21-5,House>你给丈夫做的超声如何?
<21-5,House>You run the echo on the husband?

363
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,750
<21-6,Taub>心脏持续衰竭 好转只是暂时的
<21-6,Taub>Heart's still failing. Theabcimprovement was only temporary.

364
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:09,860
<21-7,House>我比较喜欢简单的答法:abcHouse 你是对的
<21-7,House>I prefer the less subtle answer:abcYou were right,house.

365
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:13,350
<21-7,House>既然...不用花时间abc纠结丈夫为什么死不了
<21-7,House>So...less time proving why hubby isn't dead.

366
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,950
<21-7,House>就有更多时间研究Kutner为什么会死...
<21-7,House>More time proving why kutner is.

367
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,470
<21-7,House>谋杀动机

<21-8,Thirteen>House...这是自杀abc警察已经调查过了
<21-8,Thirteen>House... it was a suicide. Theabcpolice have already investigated.

369
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:27,520
<21-9,House>他们只调查他们眼见的东西abc而忽略了看不到的
<21-9,House>They investigated what theyabcsaw,not what they didn't saw.

370
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:31,280
<21-9,House>去找他的朋友 同学 送比萨的人聊聊
<21-9,House>Talk to friends,classmates,pizzaabcdelivery guy.

371
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,530
<21-9,House>还有联系Foreman
<21-9,House>And draft foreman.

372
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,710
<21-9,House>- 他可以边抹眼泪边接电话abc- 不
<21-9,House>- He can make calls through his tears.abc- No.

373
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,760
<21-11,House>你这个"不" 是指"我才不要打给我男友
<21-11,House>Is that no,I'm not calling my boyfriend,

374
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:39,670
<21-11,House>谁叫他刚才打给我上司abc而不是我说他不回来"吗?
<21-11,House>who apparently called my boss insteadabcof me to say he wasn't coming in?

375
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,520
<21-11,House>真不公平 凭什么你一个音节abc里头能包含这么多潜台词?
<21-11,House>'Cause it's really not fair to haveabcthat much subtext in one syllable.

376
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,720
<21-12,Thirteen>我们都想知道 为什么Kutner这么做
<21-12,Thirteen>We all wanna know why kutner did it.

377
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:47,730
<21-12,Thirteen>但我们不想浪费时间去纠缠鬼魂
<21-12,Thirteen>But we're not gonna wasteabctime chasing ghosts.

378
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,070
<21-13,House>你们一点不好奇吗?
<21-13,House>You're not remotely curious?

379
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:58,200
<21-14,Taub>我只好奇为什么一个崇尚理性的人abc忽然变得不理智了
<21-14,Taub>Only why a man who embraces the rationalabcis suddenly pursuing the irrational.

380
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:04,290
<21-15,House>她可能得了α1-抗胰蛋白酶缺乏症
<21-15,House>She could haveabcalpha-1anti-trypsin deficiency.

381

<21-15,House>给她做个α1抗胰蛋白酶测试
<21-15,House>Run her aat proteins.

<22-1,Taub>It's too soon after your surgery.

384
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:20,690
<22-2,Charlotte>你死后可以指定把器官捐给某个人 对吧?
<22-2,Charlotte>You can ask that someone getabcyour organs if you die,right?

385
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:23,510
<22-2,Charlotte>即便器官银行不批准?
<22-2,Charlotte>Even if the donor bank turned them down?

386
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:28,290
<22-3,Taub>个人捐赠者可以绕过登记程序abc但还有很多因素要考虑...
<22-3,Taub>Individual donors can bypass the registry,butabcthere are a lot of other factors...

387
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,680
<22-4,Charlotte>- 比如血型--abc- 我给他输过血
<22-4,Charlotte>- blood type-- -abcI've given him blood.

403
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,960
<24-1,Cuddy>显然有人还登陆着
<24-1,Cuddy>Apparently,someone's stillabclogged onto it.

404
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:50,860
<24-2,House>不难猜到密码是kutner
<24-2,House>It wasn't hard to figureabcout that his password was kutner.

00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,790
<24-2,House>他做了他们不让你做的事

<24-4,House>杀了他们的人就要假释了
<24-4,House>And the guy who killedabcthem is coming up for parole.

00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,740
<24-5,Cuddy>他是要假释了
<24-5,Cuddy>He's coming up for parole.

<24-6,House>Kutner在每个听证会上都作了供
<24-6,House>Kutner testified at everyabcone of his hearings.

<24-6,House>他不是唯一在计算时间的人
<24-6,House>The guy wouldn't be theabcfirst to see the clock ticking.

<24-7,Cuddy>他是被自己的枪杀死的
<24-7,Cuddy>He was killed by his own gun.

<24-10,House>凶手从没想过把它弄得像自杀--
<24-10,House>Right,the murderer would neverabctry to make it look like suicide--

416
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:18,120
<24-10,House>这太不道德了
<24-10,House>that would be unethical.

417
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:24,440
<24-10,House>你没问病人的事
<24-10,House>You haven't asked about my patient.

418
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:26,700
<24-11,Cuddy>你在等α-1抗胰蛋白酶的结果
<24-11,Cuddy>You're waiting on aat protein results.

419
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:29,030
<24-12,House>就是说你查过我是不是还关注病人
<24-12,House>Means you checked up toabcsee that I'm still on it.

420
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,680
<24-12,House>你想把病人转给别人 但又没有
<24-12,House>You wanna transferabcthe case,but you won't

421
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:34,830
<24-12,House>因为你认为这是唯一abc能让我集中精力的事
<24-12,House>because you think it's the onlyabcthing that's holding me together.

422
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:39,520
<24-12,House>放轻松 我是对是错 很快就知道了
<24-12,House>Relax. Either I'm right or I'mabcwrong. We'll know soon enough.

423

<25-2,Thirteen>She broke into the cart andabcinjected whatever she could grab.

428
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:56,630
<25-2,Thirteen>做傻事 让自己情况比Eddie更糟
<25-2,Thirteen>Dumb way to look worse for eddie.

429
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,190
<25-3,Taub>她不是想让自己更糟
<25-3,Taub>She wasn't trying to look worse.

430
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:02,380
<25-3,Taub>她是想自杀
<25-3,Taub>She was trying to kill herself.

431
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:08,120
<25-3,Taub>现在稳定了 但她的肝彻底停止工作
<25-3,Taub>She's stable,but whatever was leftabcof her liver is definitely shot now.

432
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,050
<25-3,Taub>Eddie也没什么变化
<25-3,Taub>And there's no change in eddie.

00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,170
<25-3,Taub>那...感谢这个白痴般的行为
<25-3,Taub>So...thanks to her idiotic move,

<27-1,House>找不到新肝脏的话abc二十四小时内她就会死
<27-1,House>she's dead in 24 hours ifabcshe doesn't get a new ler.

435

<27-2,Taub>这是无私 她很爱他
<27-2,Taub>It was selfless. She loves him.

436
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:20,860
<27-3,House>这和我说的有冲突吗?
<27-3,House>How does that disagree withabcwhat I just said?

437

<27-4,Thirteen>α-1抗胰蛋白酶缺乏检查呈阴性

<27-5,Taub>We should try a partial donationabcfrom a live donor.

440
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,590
<27-6,Thirteen>损伤太严重了 她需要一整个肝
<27-6,Thirteen>Damage is too severe. Sheabcneeds a whole new liver.

441
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,430
<27-7,Taub>没有诊断结果 没有肝脏
<27-7,Taub>No diagnosis,no liver.

442
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:34,650
<27-7,Taub>没有肝脏 活不下去
<27-7,Taub>No liver,no living.

443
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:37,130
<27-8,House>你怎么知道?
<27-8,House>What do you know?

444
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:40,240
<27-8,House>这就是骨髓纤维变性
<27-8,House>It is myelofrosis.

445
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,640
<27-8,House>这儿写着呢
<27-8,House>Says so right here.

446
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:42,910
<27-8,House>谁去给Cuddy说?
<27-8,House>Who wants to tell cuddy?

447
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,170
<27-9,Thirteen>你对移植委员会撒过多少次谎了?
<27-9,Thirteen>How many times have you lied toabcthe transplant committee?

448
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:47,510
<27-11,Thirteen>- 就两次abc- 几次有用的?
<27-11,Thirteen>- Just twice.abc- How many times has it worked?

449
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:50,510
<27-12,House>我...看不出来这有什么联系
<27-12,House>I... don't quite see how that's relevant.

450
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:56,500
<27-12,House>住手 警察来了
<27-12,House>Cheese it. It's the coppers.

451
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:59,800
<27-13,Thirteen>在你执着于调查Kutner的时候abc我们不会放任他们死去
<27-13,Thirteen>We're not just gonna leave themabcto die while you fixate on kutner.

452
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:02,550
<27-14,House>技术上说 他不是我们的病人
<27-14,House>Technically,he's not our patient.

453
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:04,330
<27-14,House>所以我只是任她死了
<27-14,House>So I'm really only leaving her to die.

454
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:06,280
<27-15,Taub>通常情况我们已经想过了
<27-15,Taub>We've already explored the usual options.

455
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,590
<27-15,Taub>不再考虑下罕见的情况吗?
<27-15,Taub>Shouldn't we at leastabcexplore unusual ones?

456
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:12,260
<27-16,House>当然 别担心 上帝给了我两只耳朵
<27-16,House>Absolutely. Don't worry. Thisabcis why god gave me two ears.

457
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:16,420
<27-17,Taub>Kutner会说 让我们对Cuddy坦白
<27-17,Taub>Kutner would say we should justabccome clean with cuddy.

458
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:20,540
<27-18,House>如果他在这儿的话
<27-18,House>If only he were here to say that.

459
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:22,820
<27-18,House>我确定Cuddy一定会偏向那个老家伙
<27-18,House>I'm sure cuddy wouldabcbe bound to fall for the old,

460
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:26,280
<27-18,House>"嗨 死人不会介意我们--"
<27-18,House>"hey,the dead guy won'tabcmind if we're wasting--"

461
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:37,330
<28-1,House>需要一个无可救药浪漫主义者说服另一个
<28-1,House>Need an incurable romantic toabctalk to incurable romantic.

462
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:38,490
<28-2,Cameron>Kutner不是被谋杀的
<28-2,Cameron>Kutner wasn't murdered.

463
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:42,210
<28-3,House>你是伴着那首"Who"摘下墨镜abc推论出来的吧?(CSI)
<28-3,House>You deduce that by removing yourabcsun glasses to the strains of a who song?

464
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:45,870
<28-4,Cameron>自杀意味着你原本能帮他abc谋杀就不是你的责任
<28-4,Cameron>Suicide means you could have helpedabchim. Murder lets you off the hook.

465
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:52,490
<28-5,House>说肝脏肝脏到
<28-5,House>Needs a liver. Has a liver.

466
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,840
<28-5,House>他能部分捐赠
<28-5,House>He can make a partial donation.

467
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:58,420
<28-5,House>他越快同意 她越快逃过死神
<28-5,House>The faster he agrees,theabcfaster she gets to not die.

468
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:00,250
<28-6,Cameron>部分不够 她要整个肝
<28-6,Cameron>Partial won't be enough.abcShe needs a whole liver.

469
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:03,730
<28-6,Cameron>而他会死于手术
<28-6,Cameron>And he'd never survive the procedure.

470
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,390
<28-7,House>真对仗啊?
<28-7,House>Nice symmetry,huh?

471
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:12,270
<28-8,Cameron>要是他在手术中死去 你就有一整个肝了
<28-8,Cameron>He dies on the table,andabcyou give her his whole liver.

472
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:15,250
<28-9,House>如果他会 那也是为了爱
<28-9,House>If he's gonna do this,he'sabcgonna do this for love.

473
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:18,950
<28-9,House>我想他得和说同种语言的人交流
<28-9,House>I thought he should talkabcto someone who spoke the language.

474
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:22,800
<29-1,Eddie>你想我死在手术台上
<29-1,Eddie>You want me to die on the table.

475
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:24,810
<29-2,Cameron>不是我们想
<29-2,Cameron>We don't want you to.

476
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:27,400
<29-2,Cameron>是你妻子需要
<29-2,Cameron>Your wife needs you to.

477
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:28,580
<29-3,Eddie>我的心脏呢?
<29-3,Eddie>My heart?

478
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:32,010
<29-4,Cameron>快要不行了 你最多还有几天
<29-4,Cameron>Is still dying. You haveabca couple days at most.

479
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:35,430
<29-4,Cameron>但这时间足够救她
<29-4,Cameron>But this could buyabcuse enough time to save her.

480
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:38,010
<29-5,Eddie>我什么时候对她说再见?
<29-5,Eddie>When can I say good-bye?

481
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:39,690
<29-5,Eddie>你不能
<29-5,Eddie>You can't.

482
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:42,960
<29-6,Cameron>如果她知道了这个 你认为她会同意吗?
<29-6,Cameron>If she knew what weabcwere planning,would she be okay?

483
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,370
<29-7,Eddie>她会恨我
<29-7,Eddie>She'll resent me.

484
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:51,260
<29-8,Cameron>她会活下来 其他的都不重要
<29-8,Cameron>She'll be alive. Nothing else matters.

485
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:12,910
<30-1,Cameron>不能进行移植
<30-1,Cameron>You can't do the transplant.

486
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:14,680
<30-2,House>除非他说不
<30-2,House>Only if he said no.

487
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:17,170
<30-2,House>但你这样急说明他同意了
<30-2,House>But your urgentabchovering means he said yes.

488
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:20,180
<30-3,Cameron>他的手指有结节 可能他的医生诊断错了
<30-3,Cameron>His fingers have nodules. Iabcthink his doctors misdiagnosed him.

489
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:23,210
<30-4,House>或是你想得太美好了
<30-4,House>Or you sprinkled tooabcmuch wishful thinking in your tea.

<30-5,Cameron>肥胖者伴有肺癌--很容易解释心衰
<30-5,Cameron>Obese man with lung cancer-- two easyabcexplanations for his heart failure.

491
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:29,190
<30-5,Cameron>但结节说明是另外的 可治愈的
<30-5,Cameron>No dules can mean somethingabcelse,somethg curable.

492

495
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:37,710

496
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:39,980
<30-8,House>除了你是错的
