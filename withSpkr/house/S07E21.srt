00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:00,250
<2-2,Glenn>格伦得解手  人有三急
<2-2,Glenn>Glenn had to take a leak. It was unavoidable.

<3-2,Lee>CT-10非常轻  无人机也可发射
<3-2,Lee>The CT-10's light enough to launch from a UAV,

19
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:22,220
<3-2,Lee>爆炸前  可穿透抗压强度约四万兆帕
<3-2,Lee>but can penetrate 8 feet of 6,000-psi concrete

<3-5,General>声响方面呢
<3-5,General>What about sound?

26
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,580
<3-6,Lee>完全监测不到

<3-6,Lee>我们开发出一种新风机

31
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:52,640
<4-2,Glenn>你需要看心理医生

00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,440
<5-1,Thirteen>因果报应
<5-1,Thirteen>Karma's a bitch.

56
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,240
<5-2,Foreman>你觉得她癫痫发作是报应
<5-2,Foreman>You think her seizures are the result of bad karma?

57
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:08,680
<5-3,Thirteen>我觉得要是你把时间全花在
<5-3,Thirteen>I think if you spend your days

58
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:11,220
<5-3,Thirteen>如何更精准的炸飞别人这件事上

00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:24,450
<5-4,House>口渴

00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:27,810
<5-5,Chase>看不出你有局部充血啊
<5-5,Chase>You don't seem congested.

63
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,820
<5-6,House>有意思
<5-6,House>Intriguing.

64
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,000
<5-7,Taub>你对这个病人有什么想法
<5-7,Taub>You have any thoughts about our patient?

65
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,690
<5-8,House>对十三是真相信还是只是强迫自己相信
<5-8,House>Got some questions about whether Thirteen

66
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:35,300
<5-8,House>因果报应这个事  倒是有些疑问
<5-8,House>really believes in karma or just wants to.

67
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:36,470
<5-8,House>至于病人
<5-8,House>As for the patient,

68
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,160
<5-8,House>要闯入她办公室肯定不容易
<5-8,House>it's not gonna be easy to break into her office.

69
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:39,560
<5-8,House>那就从她家开始
<5-8,House>Might want to start with her home.

70
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:41,570
<5-9,Foreman>我们可征求同意  再查看她的办公室
<5-9,Foreman>We could ask to look through her office

71
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:43,330
<5-9,Foreman>同时先给她做核磁共振
<5-9,Foreman>and we could do an MRI first.

72
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:44,860
<5-10,House>行  去吧
<5-10,House>Sure. Go ahead.

73
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:48,650
<5-11,Taub>你要是对这个病例没兴趣
<5-11,Taub>If you're not interested in the case,

74
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:49,570
<5-11,Taub>为什么要接呢
<5-11,Taub>why'd you take it?

75
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,820
<5-12,House>我当然感兴趣
<5-12,House>I am definitely interested.

76
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:52,790
<5-12,House>可能是肿瘤  可能是颅内出血
<5-12,House>Could be a tumor. Could be a cns bleed.

77
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,350
<5-12,House>两个谜题待你解答  还有何求
<5-12,House>What do you do when you got two interesting puzzles?

78
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:56,970
<5-13,Taub>两个
<5-13,Taub>Two?

79
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,680
<5-14,Wilson>50块
<5-14,Wilson>50 bucks!

80
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:00,620
<5-14,Wilson>给钱
<5-14,Wilson>Pay up.

81
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,300
<5-15,Wilson>快给  快给
<5-15,Wilson>Let's go. Let's go.

82
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,370
<5-16,House>这赌不算
<5-16,House>Bet's off.

83
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,830
<5-16,House>有人操控比赛结果
<5-16,House>Fight was fixed.

84
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:17,680
<5-16,House>那一拳都没打到他
<5-16,House>That punch barely touched him.

85
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:20,340
<5-17,Foreman>你赌福利能打赢扎卡里[拳击手]
<5-17,Foreman>You bet on Foley to beat Zachary?

86
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:21,690
<5-18,House>速度型战胜力量型
<5-18,House>Speed beats power...

87
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,160
<5-18,House>除非有人买通了他
<5-18,House>Unless speed has been paid

88
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,530
<5-18,House>让他速度地故意输掉
<5-18,House>to speedily take a dive.

89
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:26,350
<5-19,Wilson>他被打到的次数不少  承受不了很正常
<5-19,Wilson>He touched him enough to put him on the canvas

90
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:27,700
<5-19,Wilson>倒数结束  他还无法站起来
<5-19,Wilson>and the official counted him out,

91
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,980
<5-19,Wilson>铁证如山  你欠我
<5-19,Wilson>which means you officially owe me

92
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:31,570
<5-19,Wilson>50块
<5-19,Wilson>50 bucks.

93
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:34,260
<5-20,House>我们赌的是体育赛事
<5-20,House>We bet on a sporting event.

94
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:35,740
<5-20,House>那才不是体育
<5-20,House>That was not sporting.

95
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,220
<5-20,House>都不到30秒
<5-20,House>Less than 30 seconds.

96
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,460
<5-20,House>都算不上比赛
<5-20,House>That was barely even event-y.

97
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:41,060
<5-21,Wilson>我看到的是
<5-21,Wilson>Okay, here's what I saw.

98
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:43,080
<5-21,Wilson>你输  我赢
<5-21,Wilson>You lost and I won.

99
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,380
<5-22,House>行  你就带着这个念头进棺材吧
<5-22,House>Yeah, well, you can take that to your grave.

100
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,650
<5-22,House>我才不会把那50块给你
<5-22,House>You're not taking my 50 bucks.

101
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:46,560
<5-23,Wilson>拿出证据
<5-23,Wilson>Prove it.

102
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:47,830
<5-23,Wilson>拿出证据  要么给钱
<5-23,Wilson>Prove it or pay up.

103
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:49,130
<5-23,Wilson>你有一天时间
<5-23,Wilson>You got one day.

104
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,080
<5-23,Wilson>别逼我派我的小鸭子们去找你讨债
<5-23,Wilson>And don't make me send my boys out looking for you.

105
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:53,650
<5-23,Wilson>什么
<5-23,Wilson>What?

106
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:58,710
<5-24,House>好吧
<5-24,House>All right.

107
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,310
<5-24,House>话说  有两个谜题
<5-24,House>So, two puzzles.

108
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,200
<5-24,House>我去解开害我输钱的那个
<5-24,House>Tie goes to the one that costs me money.

109
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:05,860
<5-24,House>记得互通进展
<5-24,House>Keep each other posted.

110
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,390
<6-1,Lee>我一直很健康
<6-1,Lee>I've always been healthy.

111
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,460
<6-1,Lee>连感冒都没得过
<6-1,Lee>I never even get colds.

112
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,110
<6-2,Thirteen>看来你的好运到头了
<6-2,Thirteen>I guess your luck finally ran out.

113
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,200
<6-3,Lee>看来她不喜欢造炸弹的人
<6-3,Lee>I take it she doesn't like people who makes bombs.

114
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,540
<6-4,Thirteen>抱歉  我不是故意的
<6-4,Thirteen>I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

115
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,560
<6-4,Thirteen>没事
<6-4,Thirteen>It's all right.

116
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,540
<6-5,Lee>我多半的家人也是这样想的
<6-5,Lee>Half of my family feels the same way.

117
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,670
<6-5,Lee>他们都在华尔街上班  当然会...
<6-5,Lee>Of course they all work on Wall Street, so...

118
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,440
<6-5,Lee>自打我记事开始
<6-5,Lee>Ever since the first 4th of July I can remember,

119
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,510
<6-1,Lee>我就喜欢爆炸
<6-1,Lee>I've always loved explosions.

120
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,350
<6-5,Lee>当我要念大学  选专业时
<6-5,Lee>When I got to college and I had to pick a major,

121
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:41,560
<6-5,Lee>觉得该选自己热爱的专业
<6-5,Lee>figured I might as well pick something I'm passionate about.

122
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,210
<6-6,Thirteen>你喜欢摧毁东西
<6-6,Thirteen>Destroying things.

123
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:45,010
<6-6,Thirteen>对其它的都不感兴趣吗
<6-6,Thirteen>You weren't passionate about anything else?

124
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,050
<6-7,Lee>跟其它事物一样  炸弹只是工具
<6-7,Lee>Bombs are tools, just like anything else.

125
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,740
<6-7,Lee>既有好的一面
<6-7,Lee>You can use it to make things better

126
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,000
<6-7,Lee>也有坏的一面
<6-7,Lee>or you can use it to make things worse.

127
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,450
<6-7,Lee>我也喜欢浪漫诗
<6-7,Lee>I also like romantic poetry

128
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:56,520
<6-7,Lee>还有野餐
<6-7,Lee>and picnics.

129
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:58,260
<6-7,Lee>核磁共振前还有什么
<6-7,Lee>Is there anything else you want to know

130
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,240
<6-7,Lee>你们想知道的吗
<6-7,Lee>before we do this MRI?

131
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:00,110
<6-8,Chase>没了
<6-8,Chase>Nope.

132
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,630
<6-8,Chase>尽量保持静止不动
<6-8,Chase>Try to stay as still as possible.

133
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:02,980
<6-8,Chase>不会花太久时间
<6-8,Chase>This shouldn't take long.

134
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,120
<7-1,House>你好啊
<7-1,House>Hey, how's it going?

135
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:14,900
<7-1,House>介意坐其它地方吗
<7-1,House>You mind?

136
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:16,220
<7-2,Foley>那么多空位
<7-2,Foley>I mean, there are plenty of other seats.

137
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,400
<7-3,House>我不是来评头论足
<7-3,House>I'm not here to judge.

138
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,060
<7-3,House>你做了对自己最有利的选择
<7-3,House>You did what was best for you

139
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,440
<7-3,House>这我没意见
<7-3,House>and I got no problem with that.

140
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:22,410
<7-4,Foley>我最后跟你说一次
<7-4,Foley>I'm not gonna ask you nice again.

141
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,170
<7-4,Foley>-走开  -不然怎样
<7-4,Foley>- Just go away. - Or what?

142
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:25,670
<7-5,House>你还准备把我撂倒吗
<7-5,House>Is something gonna fall down?

143
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,470
<7-5,House>听着  是这么回事
<7-5,House>Listen. I got a problem.

144
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,200
<7-5,House>一小子对拳击一窍不通
<7-5,House>A guy who knows absolutely nothing about boxing,

145
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:33,120
<7-5,House>因为你  现在他觉得自己是专家
<7-5,House>because of you, now thinks he does.

146
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,970
<7-5,House>你可以想象后果的严重性
<7-5,House>You can imagine the potential ramifications.

147
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:38,180
<7-5,House>我需要你跟他通个电话
<7-5,House>I need you to get on the phone with him

148
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:39,530
<7-5,House>告诉他你是故意放水的
<7-5,House>and tell him you took a dive.

149
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:40,680
<7-6,Foley>我并没有故意放水
<7-6,Foley>I didn't take a dive.

150
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:42,840
<7-7,House>再拍个照证明这真是你
<7-7,House>Take a picture of you to prove that it was really you

151
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,040
<7-7,House>我们就完事了
<7-7,House>and we're done.

152
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,920
<7-7,House>只为使他信服
<7-7,House>Just enough to convince him.

153
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,540
<7-7,House>不会让你惹上任何麻烦
<7-7,House>Not enough to get you in any trouble.

154
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,950
<7-8,Foley>我没有故意放水
<7-8,Foley>I didn't take a dive.

155
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:52,490
<7-8,Foley>是
<7-8,Foley>Yeah.

156
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,180
<7-9,House>你这个理由可不怎么样
<7-9,House>That story's getting boring.

157
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,540
<7-9,House>听着  我不是调查局的
<7-9,House>Look, I'm not from the commission.

158
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,680
<7-9,House>我不是什么赌博经纪人
<7-9,House>I'm not some bookie.

159
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,570
<7-9,House>我是医生  这是我的证件
<7-9,House>I'm a doctor. This is my I.D.

160
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:04,380
<7-10,Foley>听着  要你真是经纪人
<7-10,Foley>Look, if you were a bookie,

161
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,590
<7-10,Foley>你就会知道没人会贿赂
<7-10,Foley>you'd know no one pays a guy to throw a fight

162
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:08,040
<7-10,Foley>没机会赢的拳击手
<7-10,Foley>he has no chance to win.

163
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:10,120
<7-10,Foley>我是个赔率1赔12的废物
<7-10,Foley>I was a 12-to-1 underdog.

164
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:11,870
<7-10,Foley>过去五场比赛  我都输了
<7-10,Foley>Lost my last five fights.

165
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:13,240
<7-11,House>但你是个很优秀的拳击手啊
<7-11,House>But you were the better fighter.

166
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,510
<7-11,House>最后那拳几乎都没碰到你
<7-11,House>That last punch barely touched you.

167
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,590
<7-12,Foley>你有被一个重达230镑的家伙
<7-12,Foley>You ever been barely touched by a guy

168
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,250
<7-12,Foley>轻轻揍过吗
<7-12,Foley>who weighs 230 pounds?

169
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:20,850
<7-12,Foley>看看我
<7-12,Foley>Look at me.

170
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,290
<7-12,Foley>看看这个地方  还有我穿的衣服
<7-12,Foley>Look where I am, what I'm wearing.

171
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,730
<7-12,Foley>我像是个刚拿到酬劳的人吗
<7-12,Foley>Now,do I look like a guy who just got a payday?

172
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,240
<7-12,Foley>我没有故意输掉比赛
<7-12,Foley>I didn't throw the fight.

173
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,440
<7-12,Foley>我就是水平太烂
<7-12,Foley>I just suck.

174
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,230
<8-1,House>证据在此
<8-1,House>Proof.

175
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:51,670
<8-2,Wilson>仅仅因为他没有被打爆脸
<8-2,Wilson>Just because he wasn't hit in the face--

176
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:52,740
<8-3,House>看看他的瞳孔
<8-3,House>Look at his pupils.

177
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:56,970
<8-3,House>两侧瞳孔不等大  考虑到他的年龄
<8-3,House>He has anisocoria, which, given his age,

178
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:58,440
<8-3,House>以及比赛时肾上腺素的激增
<8-3,House>the adrenaline surge of the fight,

179
00:07:58,610 --> 00:07:59,700
<8-3,House>再加上目前他还活得好好的
<8-3,House>the fact that he's still alive

180
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,100
<8-3,House>说明他当时心动过速
<8-3,House>means he was tachycardic.

181
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:03,470
<8-3,House>他患有WPW综合征
<8-3,House>He has Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.

183
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:04,750
<8-4,Wilson>我们赌的是谁赢
<8-4,Wilson>The bet was on who would win,

184
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,060
<8-4,Wilson>而不是谁能活最久
<8-4,Wilson>not who would live the longest.

185
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,250
<8-5,House>如果他因为身体有病
<8-5,House>If he's physically unable to continue

186
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:10,500
<8-5,House>而在体力上不能坚持打完比赛
<8-5,House>because of a preexisting illness,

187
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:12,410
<8-5,House>那么严格意义上讲  比赛是无效的
<8-5,House>then it's technically a "No contest",

188
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,840
<8-5,House>也就是说  我们打的赌是无效的
<8-5,House>which means all bets are off.

189
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:16,030
<8-6,Wilson>即使这次拳击赌博是我猜对了
<8-6,Wilson>You know that just because I was right

190
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:17,820
<8-6,Wilson>也丝毫不会减弱你的男子气概
<8-6,Wilson>about this one fighter doesn't make you

191
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,720
<8-6,Wilson>这点你清楚  对吗
<8-6,Wilson>any less of a man?

192
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:20,730
<8-7,House>要是你赢了  还真会伤我心肝呢
<8-7,House>Actually, it would if you were right.

193
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:22,650
<8-8,Wilson>那就像我之前说的  你拿出证据来
<8-8,Wilson>Then as I said earlier, prove it.

194
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:25,630
<8-8,Wilson>一张可能处理过的手机照片
<8-8,Wilson>And one possibly photoshopped cell phone pic

195
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,180
<8-8,Wilson>不足以成为诊断依据
<8-8,Wilson>does not a diagnosis make.

196
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,320
<9-1,Cesar>豪斯医生  请等一下
<9-1,Cesar>Oh, excuse me, Dr. House.

197
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,550
<9-2,House>真抱歉  我不会说英语[法语]
<9-2,House>Desole, je parle pas anglais.

198
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,770
<9-3,Cesar>我是温迪·李的同事
<9-3,Cesar>I'm a co-worker of Wendy Lee's.

199
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,110
<9-3,Cesar>也是她的男友
<9-3,Cesar>I'm also her boyfriend.

200
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,400
<9-4,House>太棒了  我对此毫无兴趣
<9-4,House>Great. I'm a guy who doesn't care.

201
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:43,620
<9-5,Cesar>她是你的病人
<9-5,Cesar>She's your patient.

202
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,080
<9-6,House>你以为我不知道温迪·李是谁吗
<9-6,House>Oh, you thought I didn't know who Wendy Lee was?

203
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,860
<9-6,House>有点道理  我确实不太擅长记人名
<9-6,House>Yeah, makes sense. I'm not good at names.

204
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,290
<9-6,House>福运医生[指福曼]跟你提过这点吗
<9-6,House>Did Dr. Fortune tell you that?

205
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:50,810
<9-7,Cesar>她的前男友就是个疯子
<9-7,Cesar>Her last boyfriend was a real nut.

206
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:51,990
<9-7,Cesar>他一直在跟踪她
<9-7,Cesar>He's basically stalking her.

207
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,430
<9-8,House>你说的正是我不感兴趣的内容
<9-8,House>See, this is what I don't care about.

208
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:55,120
<9-8,House>我才不在乎谁关心她呢
<9-8,House>I don't care who cares about her,

209
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,450
<9-8,House>也不在乎谁曾经关心过她
<9-8,House>used to care about her.

210
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:59,750
<9-8,House>你们俩要是有人挂了  给我留张字条
<9-8,House>Either one of you falls down dead, you can drop me a note.

211
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,030
<9-9,Cesar>我想我知道她这是怎么回事
<9-9,Cesar>I think I know what's wrong with her.

212
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:04,590
<9-10,House>你弄砸了实验
<9-10,House>You screwed up in the lab

213
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,770
<9-10,House>然后不小心泼了她一身炸药吗
<9-10,House>and accidentally spilled some bomb on her?

214
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:07,730
<9-10,House>不是
<9-10,House>No.

215
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,460
<9-11,Cesar>他确实疯得够呛
<9-11,Cesar>He really is crazy.

216
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:14,850
<10-1,Thirteen>被人下毒了
<10-1,Thirteen>Poisoned?

217
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,600
<10-2,House>显然咱们疯狂的科学家
<10-2,House>Apparently our mad scientist

218
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:18,680
<10-2,House>还是位风情万种的科学家
<10-2,House>is also a slutty scientist

219
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:21,190
<10-2,House>能让她身边的呆子
<10-2,House>whose milkshakes got all the nerds in the yard

220
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,150
<10-2,House>全都为之争风吃醋
<10-2,House>fighting over her.

221
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:23,780
<10-3,Thirteen>就因为她勾搭了两名同事谈恋爱
<10-3,Thirteen>She's a slut because she's dated

222
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:24,820
<10-3,Thirteen>你就说她放荡吗
<10-3,Thirteen>two different guys at work?

223
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:25,950
<10-4,House>真抱歉
<10-4,House>Oh, I'm sorry.

224
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:27,380
<10-4,House>我以为咱们仍然在对她品头论足呢
<10-4,House>I thought we were still judging her.

225
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:28,940
<10-5,Foreman>她不是荡妇  也没被下毒
<10-5,Foreman>She's not a slut and it's not poison.

226
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,650
<10-5,Foreman>我们检测了她的血液和脑脊液
<10-5,Foreman>When we tested her blood and cerebral spinal fluid

227
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:32,230
<10-5,Foreman>没有发现任何我们能想到的
<10-5,Foreman>for toxic exposure, it was negative

228
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,470
<10-5,Foreman>有毒物质
<10-5,Foreman>for every poison we could think of.

229
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:35,010
<10-6,Taub>看来就只剩下
<10-6,Taub>Well, that just leaves

230
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,400
<10-6,Taub>所有我们没能想到的有毒物质了
<10-6,Taub>every poison we didn't think of.

231
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:37,540
<10-6,Taub>她在炸弹工厂上班
<10-6,Taub>She works in a bomb factory.

232
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,040
<10-7,Foreman>那里也有很多人没生病
<10-7,Foreman>So do a lot of other not-sick people.

233
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:40,890
<10-8,Thirteen>如果他有她被下毒的真凭实据
<10-8,Thirteen>The guy had any actual evidence she was poisoned,

234
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,800
<10-8,Thirteen>就会去找警察  而不是我们了
<10-8,Thirteen>he would have gone to the police, not to us.

235
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:44,550
<10-9,Taub>如果有任何有助于诊断的线索
<10-9,Taub>And if we had any evidence of what was wrong with her,

236
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:46,220
<10-9,Taub>你早就给我们看MRI的结果了
<10-9,Taub>you'd be showing us MRI results.

237
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:47,690
<10-9,Taub>所以我猜结果是阴性
<10-9,Taub>I assume they were negative.

238
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:51,050
<10-10,Chase>不妨试试活性炭  看看病人有什么反应
<10-10,Chase>Couldn't hurt to start activated charcoal, see what happens.

239
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,520
<10-11,House>知道还有什么也可以不妨一试吗
<10-11,House>You know what else wouldn't hurt?

240
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,620
<10-11,House>病例是越来越有趣了
<10-11,House>This case is getting interesting.

241
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:56,860
<10-11,House>不妨再给它加把劲吧
<10-11,House>Let's add a little danger.

242
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:19,430
<11-2,Chase>仅仅因为他持有枪支
<11-2,Chase>Just because he has guns

243
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:20,810
<11-2,Chase>并不能证明他就是个凶手
<11-2,Chase>doesn't make him a murderer.

244
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,340
<11-3,Thirteen>这话你倒是跟这头熊说去
<11-3,Thirteen>Tell that to the bear.

245
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:23,010
<11-4,Chase>查查写字台
<11-4,Chase>Look in the desk.

246
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,960
<11-4,Chase>看看他有没有日记或记事簿
<11-4,Chase>See if he's got a diary or a journal.

247
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,180
<11-5,Thirteen>有迹象表明  他并不是那种
<11-5,Thirteen>Something tells me he's not exactly

248
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:27,240
<11-5,Thirteen>喜欢记日记的人
<11-5,Thirteen>a diary kind of guy,

249
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,310
<11-5,Thirteen>赤裸裸的威胁倒有可能
<11-5,Thirteen>maybe a manifesto.

250
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,330
<11-6,Chase>随便查一下
<11-6,Chase>Just look.

251
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,750
<11-6,Chase>我去检查下其它地方
<11-6,Chase>I'm gonna check out the rest of the place,

252
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,100
<11-6,Chase>看看他有没有电脑
<11-6,Chase>see if he's got a computer.

253
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,760
<11-7,Thirteen>-福曼打来的  -什么事
<11-7,Thirteen>- It's Foreman. - Yep?

254
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:35,730
<11-8,Foreman>你们已经进去了吗
<11-8,Foreman>You break in yet?

255
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,150
<11-9,Thirteen>是啊  我们正身处屠宰场呢
<11-9,Thirteen>Yeah, we're in the abattoir now.

256
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:38,340
<11-10,Foreman>-怎么了  -你们可以撤了
<11-10,Foreman>- Why? - You can leave.

257
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:40,420
<11-10,Foreman>我觉得我们已经找到了所需的证据
<11-10,Foreman>I think Taub and I found what we're looking for.

258
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:44,140
<11-11,Foreman>看起来她确实一直被人下毒
<11-11,Foreman>Looks like she actually was being poisoned,

259
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:46,090
<11-11,Foreman>只不过投毒者正是她自己
<11-11,Foreman>but she's been doing it to herself.

260
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:51,380
<12-1,Lee>-我不酗酒  -我明白
<12-1,Lee>- I'm not an alcoholic. - I know.

261
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:53,800
<12-2,Taub>你喝酒是有控制的喝
<12-2,Taub>I know the whole label thing is so limiting.

262
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:56,800
<12-2,Taub>现在只是碰巧酒精中毒而已
<12-2,Taub>You're a person who happens to suffer from alcoholism.

263
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,580
<12-3,Lee>你非法闯入我家
<12-3,Lee>You broke into my house

264
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,370
<12-3,Lee>现在又自作聪明  是吗
<12-3,Lee>and now you're being a smart ass?

265
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,930
<12-4,Foreman>你在病史里声称自己滴酒不沾
<12-4,Foreman>During your history, you said you didn't drink at all.

266
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:03,840
<12-5,Lee>我确实不喝酒
<12-5,Lee>I don't.

267
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,380
<12-6,Taub>-你只是收集酒瓶子玩  -是的
<12-6,Taub>- You just collect bottles. - Yes.

268
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:08,430
<12-7,Lee>那些酒瓶子是给我朋友的
<12-7,Lee>I collect them for my friend.

269
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,120
<12-7,Lee>她要用来做艺术品
<12-7,Lee>She uses them in her art projects.

270
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:12,420
<12-8,Taub>而这些艺术品让你拿不出手
<12-8,Taub>And you're ashamed of these art projects.

271
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,730
<12-8,Taub>你把瓶子都藏起来了
<12-8,Taub>The bottles were hidden.

272
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,700
<12-9,Lee>那是因为清洁工总是要扔掉它们
<12-9,Lee>That's because my housekeeper keeps throwing them out.

273
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,120
<12-9,Lee>我告诉她无数次了
<12-9,Lee>I've told her a dozen times not to,

274
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:20,360
<12-9,Lee>她要么没听懂要么压根不在乎
<12-9,Lee>but either she doesn't understand or she doesn't care.

275
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,570
<13-1,Chase>-她干嘛撒谎呢  -没深度的问题
<13-1,Chase>- Why would she lie? - That's the easy question.

276
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:27,660
<13-2,Thirteen>她的工作要求她通过政府安全合格认证
<13-2,Thirteen>She needs a government security clearance for her job.

277
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:28,930
<13-3,Taub>那什么才是有深度的问题
<13-3,Taub>And what's the hard question?

278
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,690
<13-4,Thirteen>如果她酗酒  那为什么她家里
<13-4,Thirteen>If she's an alcoholic, why doesn't she have

279
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,990
<13-4,Thirteen>一个喝剩下一半的酒瓶都没有呢
<13-4,Thirteen>at least some partially-full bottles in the house?

280
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,260
<13-4,Thirteen>我的意思是  干嘛留着空瓶子
<13-4,Thirteen>I mean, why keep the empties?

281
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,450
<13-4,Thirteen>干嘛不直接扔掉呢
<13-4,Thirteen>Why not just throw them away?

282
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:38,050
<13-5,Foreman>也就是说  很有可能她讲的都是实话
<13-5,Foreman>So she's probably telling the truth.

283
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:39,380
<13-6,Taub>那我们怎么办
<13-6,Taub>So what do we do?

284
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,510
<13-7,Foreman>使用安定让她戒酒
<13-7,Foreman>We start her on valium for alcohol withdrawal.

285
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:46,900
<13-7,Foreman>这是我们目前最好的办法了
<13-7,Foreman>It's the best we've got right now.

286
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,420
<14-1,House>心电图正常并不代表身体健康
<14-1,House>One normal EKG does not a healthy person make.

287
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,840
<14-2,Foley>我说了  我就是水平太烂
<14-2,Foley>Look, I told you I just suck.

288
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,870
<14-3,House>你可真让我寒心
<14-3,House>Oh, you make me so sad.

289
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:01,790
<14-3,House>别用那种口气跟我说话
<14-3,House>Don't talk like that.

290
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,220
<14-4,Foley>你干嘛这么关心我
<14-4,Foley>Why do you care so much?

291
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,660
<14-5,House>医生关心病人  天经地义
<14-5,House>Kill me for loving my patients.

292
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,820
<14-5,House>我就靠这个吃饭呢
<14-5,House>It's just what I do.

293
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:10,900
<14-6,House>别走  站住
<14-6,House>Hey, stop. Stop!

294
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,930
<14-6,House>我的...我腿脚不方便
<14-6,House>Look, my--my leg hurts. Okay?

295
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,440
<14-6,House>我们好好聊一聊
<14-6,House>Just talk to me for a moment.

296
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,140
<14-6,House>你不要自暴自弃
<14-6,House>You don't have to be a loser.

297
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:29,980
<14-7,Foley>谢了
<14-7,Foley>Thanks.

298
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:32,000
<14-8,House>不管是什么问题  你的确生病了
<14-8,House>Whatever's wrong with you, it's real.

299
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,960
<14-8,House>生病是好事
<14-8,House>Sick is good.

300
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,620
<14-8,House>说明你能好起来
<14-8,House>Sick means you can get better.

301
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:36,710
<14-8,House>你能变得更强
<14-8,House>You could get better.

302
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:39,180
<14-8,House>我想说的不是你身体会更健康
<14-8,House>And I don't mean healthier.

303
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,230
<14-8,House>我想说的是
<14-8,House>I mean...

304
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:42,860
<14-8,House>或许你的拳击比赛就不会无疾而终
<14-8,House>Maybe you don't have to suck.

305
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:51,210
<14-9,Foley>你还是想想自己有什么毛病吧
<14-9,Foley>Figure out what's wrong with yourself.

306
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,760
<14-9,Foley>别来烦我
<14-9,Foley>Leave me alone.

307
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,060
<15-1,Hoffner>病人腹痛
<15-1,Hoffner>Abdominal pain.

308
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:03,100
<15-2,Cesar>她说就好像是被捅了一样疼
<15-2,Cesar>She said it felt like she was being stabbed.

309
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:07,910
<15-4,Foreman>静脉注射五毫克吗啡
<15-4,Foreman>Give her morphine, 5 milligrams iv.

310
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,710
<15-4,Foreman>这是她身上未知疾病的症状
<15-4,Foreman>Is it a symptom of the underlying condition,

311
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:12,070
<16-1,Taub>还是她对我们治疗的反应
<16-1,Taub>or a symptom of our treatment?

312
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,920
<16-2,Chase>很快就能知道了  我已经停了她的治疗
<16-2,Chase>We'll know soon. I stopped her treatment.

313
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:14,970
<16-3,Foreman>应该继续开始
<16-3,Foreman>We should restart it.

314
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,630
<16-3,Foreman>疼痛可能是由
<16-3,Foreman>Acute pancreatitis from alcoholism

315
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:17,730
<16-3,Foreman>酒精中毒诱发的急性胰腺炎引起
<16-3,Foreman>would cause this kind of pain.

316
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:18,700
<16-4,Thirteen>是压力诱发的
<16-4,Thirteen>It's stress related.

317
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,850
<16-5,Foreman>她正忍受着剧烈疼痛
<16-5,Foreman>She's in a lot of pain.

318
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:20,720
<16-6,Thirteen>她遭受着巨大压力
<16-6,Thirteen>She's under a lot of stress.

319
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,390
<16-6,Thirteen>有两个男人为她争风吃醋
<16-6,Thirteen>She's got two guys fighting over her

320
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,620
<16-6,Thirteen>她刚完成了新炸弹的最后测试环节
<16-6,Thirteen>and she got done with the final test of a new bomb.

321
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:25,710
<16-6,Thirteen>罪恶感让她一病不起
<16-6,Thirteen>Her guilt is killing her.

322
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:27,460
<16-7,Foreman>我倒是觉得  她喜欢成为焦点
<16-7,Foreman>As far as you know, she likes being the center

323
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:28,470
<16-7,Foreman>热爱自己的工作
<16-7,Foreman>of attention and loves her job.

324
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:29,520
<16-8,Thirteen>你也知道她不喝酒吧
<16-8,Thirteen>As far as you know, she doesn't drink.

325
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,820
<16-9,Chase>如果是肾脏感染吗
<16-9,Chase>What if it's a kidney infection?

326
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:32,660
<16-9,Chase>不给她静脉滴注抗生素的话
<16-9,Chase>Acute pyelonephritis could kill her

327
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:34,340
<16-9,Chase>她会死于急性肾盂肾炎
<16-9,Chase>if we don't start her on iv antibiotics.

328
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,130
<16-10,Foreman>如果确实是肾盂肾炎的话  她才会
<16-10,Foreman>Would kill her if it was pyelonephritis,

329
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,470
<16-10,Foreman>但是她的尿液和脑脊液检查
<16-10,Foreman>but since her urine and csf

330
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:38,600
<16-10,Foreman>并未显示出感染的迹象
<16-10,Foreman>don't show signs of infection--

331
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,700
<16-10,Foreman>我呼了豪斯
<16-10,Foreman>I paged House.

332
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,790
<16-11,Taub>干嘛这样看我  我们毫无头绪
<16-11,Taub>What? We got nothing.

333
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:46,620
<16-11,Taub>应该说是更糟  他根本无视我的呼叫
<16-11,Taub>Less than nothing since he's actually ignoring my pages,

334
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:47,950
<16-11,Taub>也就是说  我们有个病患
<16-11,Taub>which means we have a sick patient

335
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:49,800
<16-11,Taub>和一个无药可救的老板
<16-11,Taub>and apparently a sick boss.

336
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,940
<17-1,Foreman>你去告诉他  你认输了
<17-1,Foreman>Tell him you admit he's right.

337
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:07,970
<17-1,Foreman>我们得让他回到工作中来
<17-1,Foreman>Let's get him back to work.

338
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,660
<17-2,Wilson>他忽略你  是因为他信任你
<17-2,Wilson>If he's ignoring you,it's because he trusts you.

339
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:12,640
<17-3,Foreman>不  不是的
<17-3,Foreman>No, it's not.

340
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,130
<17-4,Wilson>好吧  也许不是  但他确实信任你
<17-4,Wilson>No, it's not, but he does.

341
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:15,790
<17-5,Foreman>谢谢  你这么说我真感动
<17-5,Foreman>Thanks. I feel warm inside.

342
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:16,970
<17-5,Foreman>我现在正纠结于
<17-5,Foreman>Right now I'm debating

343
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:19,480
<17-5,Foreman>该硬着头皮把哪个诊断当作是正确的
<17-5,Foreman>which bad idea I should pretend is a good idea

344
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:20,750
<17-5,Foreman>然后强迫其他人去实施
<17-5,Foreman>and force everybody to implement.

345
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,120
<17-6,Wilson>我觉得这对他有好处
<17-6,Wilson>I think this is good for him.

346
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,310
<17-7,Foreman>执迷于一个赌博有好处吗
<17-7,Foreman>Obsessing over a bet is good?

347
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,830
<17-7,Foreman>做好本职工作  治愈病患
<17-7,Foreman>And doing his actual job, treating actual patients,

348
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:27,630
<17-7,Foreman>反而是无益的吗
<17-7,Foreman>that's bad?

349
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,520
<17-8,Wilson>豪斯只会做自己想做的事
<17-8,Wilson>House only doing what House wants

350
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,920
<17-8,Wilson>他这人就这样
<17-8,Wilson>is the only way he can function.

351
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:32,910
<17-8,Wilson>和卡迪分手后  他就开始
<17-8,Wilson>Since the breakup, he's been seeking out

352
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:34,850
<17-8,Wilson>不断挑战疯狂的极限
<17-8,Wilson>crazier and crazier things to do

353
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:36,580
<17-8,Wilson>就因为这些事很疯狂
<17-8,Wilson>because they're crazy.

354
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:39,880
<17-8,Wilson>而这事还不算疯狂
<17-8,Wilson>This is--well, it's not crazy.

355
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:42,370
<17-9,Foreman>是不疯狂  就是不负责任又危险罢了
<17-9,Foreman>No, just irresponsible and possibly dangerous.

356
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:43,930
<17-10,Wilson>按豪斯的标准来看  这很无趣
<17-10,Wilson>By House standards, it's dull.

357
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,360
<17-10,Wilson>而他正在琢磨的事情
<17-10,Wilson>This he's doing

358
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,960
<17-10,Wilson>纯粹是出于兴趣
<17-10,Wilson>just because he's interested.

359
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,570
<17-10,Wilson>豪斯重操旧业  以令人无语的理由
<17-10,Wilson>I think House getting back to doing...

360
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:51,670
<17-10,Wilson>做那些只有他才会做的蠢事
<17-10,Wilson>stupid House stuff for stupid House reasons

361
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,230
<17-10,Wilson>我觉得这对他来说  是好事
<17-10,Wilson>is the best thing that could happen to him.

362
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:56,270
<17-11,Foreman>我等下就这么向病人解释
<17-11,Foreman>I'll go explain that to the patient.

363
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,960
<18-1,Taub>绝对不是胰腺炎
<18-1,Taub>It's definitely not pancreatitis.

364
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,120
<18-1,Taub>重新开始治疗并未使病情有所好转
<18-1,Taub>Restarting the treatment obviously didn't help anything.

365
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:54,710
<18-1,Taub>我猜你做了肾脏感染检查
<18-1,Taub>I assume you tested for infections.

366
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,180
<18-1,Taub>而你的表情告诉我
<18-1,Taub>And I assume that look means

367
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,420
<18-1,Taub>"是的  但我的诊断错了"
<18-1,Taub>"Yes, and I was wrong."

368
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,160
<18-1,Taub>你给病人进行了心理咨询吗
<18-1,Taub>You call for a psych consult?

369
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:02,270
<18-1,Taub>你的囧样和奇斯还真是一模一样
<18-1,Taub>That's the same look I just got from Chase.

370
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,410
<18-1,Taub>一个小时前  我们有三个诊断
<18-1,Taub>So an hour ago, we had three theories

371
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,320
<18-1,Taub>但我们无法达成一致
<18-1,Taub>we couldn't agree on.

372
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:07,570
<18-1,Taub>现在我们没有任何诊断  却达成了一致
<18-1,Taub>Now we've got no theories, but we're in agreement.

373
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:14,040
<18-2,Chase>CT和超声显示
<18-2,Chase>CT and ultrasound showed inflammation

374
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:15,160
<18-2,Chase>肾被膜下有炎症
<18-2,Chase>in the renal capsule.

375
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:17,170
<18-2,Chase>可能是结石堵塞
<18-2,Chase>Could be an obstructing calculus

376
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,390
<18-2,Chase>或者是肾周脓肿
<18-2,Chase>or a perinephric abscess.

377
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:19,560
<18-3,Foreman>血培养显示阴性
<18-3,Foreman>Blood cultures came back negative.

378
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,810
<18-3,Foreman>可能只是个良性肿瘤
<18-3,Foreman>It's probably just a benign cyst.

379
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,040
<18-4,Chase>行啊  那我们就因为它可能无碍
<18-4,Chase>Yes, let's just dismiss an idea

380
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,180
<18-4,Chase>就把一种病因排除在外吧
<18-4,Chase>because it's probably nothing.

381
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,550
<18-5,Thirteen>可能是肾周间隙积气
<18-5,Thirteen>Could be gas in the perinephric space,

382
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:25,800
<18-5,Thirteen>如果这样的话  我们得让她准备好
<18-5,Thirteen>In which case,we should be prepping her

383
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:27,290
<18-5,Thirteen>进行紧急手术
<18-5,Thirteen>for emergency surgery.

384
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:31,350
<18-6,House>什么病症不是WPW综合征
<18-6,House>What looks like wolff-parkinson-white

385
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:32,420
<18-6,House>但看着像WPW综合征呢
<18-6,House>but isn't?

386
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:37,790
<18-7,Foreman>-她的心电图显示正常  -我说的是他
<18-7,Foreman>- Her EKG was normal. - So was his.

387
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,340
<18-8,House>这就是我说"看着像"的原因了
<18-8,House>That's why I said "looks like."

388
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,310
<18-8,House>也就是说是相似  但不完全一致
<18-8,House>As in similar to, but not the same.

389
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:46,040
<18-9,Taub>你想让我们帮你省下赌债
<18-9,Taub>You want us to help you get out of paying your bet

390
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,680
<18-9,Taub>徒留你真正的病人在痛苦中挣扎
<18-9,Taub>while your actual patient lies in agony.

391
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,690
<18-10,House>这里究竟谁才是坏人呢
<18-10,House>Who's the real bad guy here?

392
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:53,420
<18-10,House>是那个事不关己袖手旁观的人
<18-10,House>The guy who doesn't care enough to help

393
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:56,050
<18-10,House>还是那四个爱莫能助的人呢
<18-10,House>or the four guys who are not competent enough to help?

394
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,660
<18-10,House>他过度健身  经常挨揍
<18-10,House>He works out too much, gets pounded too much,

395
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,250
<18-10,House>当然不是情人间的打打闹闹
<18-10,House>and not in the romantic way.

396
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,450
<18-11,Taub>-他的眼球...  -我知道了
<18-11,Taub>- His pupils... - I got it.

397
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:05,720
<18-12,House>不是再说你们的病人
<18-12,House>Your patient? No.

398
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,470
<18-12,House>等你们帮我把钱省下来后
<18-12,House>Plenty of time to save her life

399
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:08,820
<18-12,House>有足够的时间去救她
<18-12,House>after we save my money.

400
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:11,890
<18-13,Taub>她的风流韵事导致了急性泌尿系统感染
<18-13,Taub>Underlying neurological condition exacerbated

401
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:14,740
<18-13,Taub>从而引起了潜在的神经系统问题
<18-13,Taub>by an acute uti brought on by her sexual escapades.

402
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,220
<18-14,Thirteen>荡妇  风流韵事
<18-14,Thirteen>Slut? Escapades?

403
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,900
<18-14,Thirteen>我们怎么治疗呢  给她挂个赤字吗
<18-14,Thirteen>How do we treat? A scarlet "A"?

405
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:18,020
<18-12,House>抱歉
<18-12,House>Sorry.

406
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,180
<18-13,Taub>她过度的性生活
<18-13,Taub>Acute uti brought on

407
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:20,980
<18-15,Taub>导致了急性泌尿系统感染
<18-15,Taub>by her healthy enjoyment of her womanhood.

408
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:23,010
<18-15,Taub>我们开始给她静脉滴注氨苄西林
<18-15,Taub>We start her on iv ampicillin

409
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:24,150
<18-15,Taub>和氨基糖苷类抗生素
<18-15,Taub>and an aminoglycoside.

410
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,330
<18-16,Foreman>你经常无视我们
<18-16,Foreman>You ignore us all the time.

411
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:37,060
<18-16,Foreman>也会做无厘头的事情
<18-16,Foreman>You go on crazy joyrides all the time.

412
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,210
<18-16,Foreman>但你会回复呼叫  会睡觉
<18-16,Foreman>But you answer pages, you sleep.

413
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,090
<18-16,Foreman>我知道我会后悔这么做的
<18-16,Foreman>I know I'm gonna regret doing this,

414
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,590
<18-16,Foreman>但我还是要问下
<18-16,Foreman>but I'll ask anyway.

415
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:46,240
<18-16,Foreman>有什么我可以帮忙的吗
<18-16,Foreman>Is there anything I can do to help?

416
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,690
<18-17,House>虽然
<18-17,House>Although...

417
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,170
<19-1,House>好消息
<19-1,House>Great news!

418
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:12,760
<19-1,House>你患有某种神经系统疾病
<19-1,House>You have an underlying neurological condition,

419
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,100
<19-1,House>再考虑到你的心脏问题
<19-1,House>which together with your heart--

420
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,460
<19-2,Foley>你说过我的心脏很好
<19-2,Foley>You said my heart was fine.

421
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:18,840
<19-2,Foley>是的  我还说能让你重振雄风
<19-2,Foley>Yeah, I also said I would get you your career back.

422
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:20,860
<19-3,House>但现在都无关紧要了
<19-3,House>But it doesn't seem to matter

423
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:23,730
<19-3,House>因为很明显你自己
<19-3,House>since you've so clearly been handed

424
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,460
<19-3,House>也准备洗手不干了
<19-3,House>the golden spit bucket.

425
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:29,090
<19-3,House>交感神经过度兴奋
<19-3,House>Sympathetic overdrive.

426
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,460
<19-3,House>是个医学术语
<19-3,House>It's a medical term.

427
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:33,890
<19-1,House>"好消息"也是
<19-1,House>So is "great news."

428
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,140
<19-3,House>当然  你想要堕落的话
<19-3,House>Of course, if you prefer wallowing...

429
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,070
<19-3,House>咱俩好好谈谈就能解决了
<19-3,House>All you need is a chin.

430
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,040
<19-3,House>显然  还要有颗心
<19-3,House>And a heart, apparently.

431
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,710
<19-3,House>你就又是那个开初二十连胜的选手
<19-3,House>Then you can go back to being the guy who won 20 of his first 20

432
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:50,250
<19-3,House>而非终了五连败的人了
<19-3,House>instead of the guy who lost 5 of his last 5.

433
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:51,260
<19-3,House>不过  准确来说
<19-3,House>Although, technically,

434
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:53,520
<19-3,House>我觉得最后一次都算不上是拳击赛
<19-3,House>I count the last one as a "no contest."

435
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:55,760
<19-4,Foley>-你就可以省五十美元了  -我是医生
<19-4,Foley>- And you save 50 bucks. - I'm a doctor.

436
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:58,680
<19-5,House>要想让我来看病  时薪不能小于三百
<19-5,House>I don't tell a fat guy to lay off bacon for less than 300.

437
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,080
<19-5,House>这事关乎我们两个人的尊严
<19-5,House>This is about dignity for both of us.

438
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:05,930
<19-5,House>把你手臂给我
<19-5,House>Give me your arm.

439
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,350
<19-5,House>把你手臂给我
<19-5,House>Give me your arm.

440
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:13,590
<19-6,Foley>怎么回事
<19-6,Foley>What the hell?

441
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,420
<19-7,House>不要担心
<19-7,House>Don't worry.

442
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:17,580
<19-7,House>肾上腺素而已
<19-7,House>It's just epinephrine.

443
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,970
<19-8,Foley>肾上  危险吗
<19-8,Foley>Ep--is it dangerous?

444
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,540
<19-9,House>使用不当的话  是很危险
<19-9,House>In the wrong hands, very.

445
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:22,820
<19-9,House>所以  是的  有点危险
<19-9,House>So...Yeah, sort of.

446
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,830
<19-9,House>只要几秒钟就好
<19-9,House>This will only take a few seconds.

447
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,070
<19-9,House>你心动过速
<19-9,House>And... You are tachycardic.

448
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,280
<19-10,Foley>老兄  你疯了吗
<19-10,Foley>Yo, are you psycho?

449
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:36,380
<19-11,House>我应用一些小小的药物手段
<19-11,House>We combine the increased heart rate with chest trauma

450
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:39,270
<19-11,House>重现比赛中出现的伴有胸痛的心动过速
<19-11,House>by applying a little sweet science to the science.

451
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:40,470
<19-11,House>不要担心
<19-11,House>Don't worry.

452
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,900
<19-11,House>我  等你醒后我会解释的
<19-11,House>I'll-- I'll explain more when you wake up.

453
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,010
<19-11,House>现在  我这个老瘸子要挥出一拳
<19-11,House>Now, the punch that supposedly knocked you out

454
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:46,110
<19-11,House>应该就可以把你打晕了
<19-11,House>looked like it was thrown by an old cripple.

455
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,210
<19-11,House>就像这样
<19-11,House>Kind of like this.

456
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:49,550
<19-12,Foley>听着  住手
<19-12,Foley>Look, stop it.

457
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,790
<19-12,Foley>三
<19-12,Foley>Three...

458
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:52,590
<19-13,House>二  一
<19-13,House>Two, one.

459
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,280
<19-13,House>看来我刚才那拳太弱了点
<19-13,House>Seem to be older and more crippled than I thought.

460
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,940
<19-14,Foley>听着  住手  你让我很难堪
<19-14,Foley>Look, no. You're embarrassing me.

461
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:04,790
<19-15,House>说不通啊
<19-15,House>Doesn't make sense.

462
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,220
<19-15,House>或许要是我
<19-15,House>Maybe if I--

463
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,690
<19-16,Foley>别再出现在我眼前  你个疯子
<19-16,Foley>Look, get the hell out of my life, you lunatic.

464
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,340
<20-1,Gibbs>她发生室性心动过速  血压在往下降
<20-1,Gibbs>She's in v-tach. BP's dropping.

465
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:27,210
<20-2,Cesar>不管你们采用了什么治疗  还是不管用
<20-2,Cesar>Whatever you're doing isn't working again.

466
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:28,900
<20-2,Cesar>总得想办法让癫痫停下来吧
<20-2,Cesar>There's got to be some way to stop the seizures.

467
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:30,540
<20-3,Taub>这并不是癫痫  她心脏病发了
<20-3,Taub>It's not a seizure. She's having a heart attack.

468
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,610
<20-4,Cesar>-没有脉搏  -不可能
<20-4,Cesar>- No pulse. - That's impossible!

469
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,030
<20-4,Cesar>她都能跑马拉松
<20-4,Cesar>She runs marathons!

470
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,690
<20-5,Chase>充电到200焦耳  离手
<20-5,Chase>Charging to 200. Clear.

471
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:40,530
<20-6,Taub>还是没有脉搏
<20-6,Taub>Still no pulse.

472
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:41,710
<20-7,Chase>充电到300焦耳
<20-7,Chase>Charging to 300.

473
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:42,760
<20-8,Cesar>-怎么会这样  -离手
<20-8,Cesar>- Why is this happening? - Clear.

474
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:45,430
<21-1,Foreman>我的理论是他之所以躲着我们
<21-1,Foreman>My theory is that he's only avoiding us

475
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:47,030
<21-1,Foreman>是因为他不想见你
<21-1,Foreman>because he really wants to avoid you.

476
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,930
<21-2,Cuddy>[逾越四问]
<21-2,Cuddy>Ma nishtanah?

477
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,030
<21-2,Cuddy>你在医学院这么多年就没参加过逾越节吗
<21-2,Cuddy>You made it through med school without ever attending a Seder?

478
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:55,330
<21-2,Cuddy>那句话的意思是  今晚和其它夜晚
<21-2,Cuddy>It means "Why is this night different

479
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,260
<21-2,Cuddy>有什么不同呢
<21-2,Cuddy>from all other nights?"

480
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,200
<21-3,Foreman>我也不确定
<21-3,Foreman>I'm not sure it is.

481
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,050
<21-3,Foreman>但一般事态严重时他都会出现
<21-3,Foreman>But usually when push comes to shove, he shows up.

482
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,430
<21-4,Cuddy>如果病人还活着  那事态还不够严重
<21-4,Cuddy>If the patient's still alive, then push hasn't met shove yet.

483
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,610
<21-5,Foreman>病人已命悬一线
<21-5,Foreman>Patient is hanging by a thread

484
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,740
<21-5,Foreman>我们确对病因毫无头绪
<21-5,Foreman>and we don't have a clue why.

485
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,400
<21-6,Cuddy>那我们只好假定豪斯胸有成竹
<21-6,Cuddy>Then we have to assume he does

486
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,480
<21-6,Cuddy>而病人还能挺住
<21-6,Cuddy>and she isn't.

487
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:09,360
<21-7,Foreman>话虽如此  我们也可以认为
<21-7,Foreman>We could or we could assume that something

488
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:10,650
<21-7,Foreman>豪斯确实出了什么事
<21-7,Foreman>is seriously wrong with House

489
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,000
<21-7,Foreman>并对此采取些行动
<21-7,Foreman>and try to do something about that.

490
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,120
<21-7,Foreman>这样即使我们错了  也没人会死
<21-7,Foreman>This way, even if we're wrong, nobody dies.

491
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:16,170
<21-8,Cuddy>豪斯没事
<21-8,Cuddy>House is fine.

492
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:18,380
<21-8,Cuddy>豪斯总能照顾好自己
<21-8,Cuddy>House is always fine.

493
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,780
<21-9,Foreman>我只是在阐述我的理论
<21-9,Foreman>I'm expanding my theory.

494
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,340
<21-9,Foreman>他躲着你  你也躲着他
<21-9,Foreman>He's avoiding you and you're avoiding him

495
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:25,680
<21-9,Foreman>而这个病人快要死了
<21-9,Foreman>and this patient is gonna die.

496
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,010
<21-10,Cuddy>你要做好本职工作她就不会死
<21-10,Cuddy>Not if you do your job.

497
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:45,630
<22-1,Thirteen>你真是个傻瓜
<22-1,Thirteen>You're an idiot.

498
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,390
<22-2,House>你怎么进来的
<22-2,House>How did you get in here?

499
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,930
<22-3,Thirteen>我老板成天让我非法闯入各种地方
<22-3,Thirteen>My boss has me break into places all the time.

500
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:57,990
<22-4,House>疼痛越来越严重了
<22-4,House>Pain has been getting worse.

501
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,050
<22-4,House>我发现如果我再加大维克丁的剂量
<22-4,House>I figured if I upped the vicodin any more,

502
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:03,400
<22-4,House>我又得回戒毒所里去了
<22-4,House>I'd end up back in a rubber room,

503
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:06,040
<22-4,House>因此这个选择看上去更明智
<22-4,House>so this seemed like the smarter choice.

504
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,440
<22-5,Thirteen>你真是个傻瓜
<22-5,Thirteen>You're an idiot.

505
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:12,220
<22-6,House>你大老远开过来
<22-6,House>You drove all the way over here

506
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:13,780
<22-6,House>闯进我家就为了叫我傻瓜吗
<22-6,House>to break in and call me an idiot?

507
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:15,860
<22-6,House>不  我大老远开过来是为了告诉你
<22-6,House>No, I drove all the way over here to tell you

508
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:17,870
<22-7,Thirteen>我们要在病人体内放置自动心脏除颤仪
<22-7,Thirteen>we're implanting an automated cardio-defibrillator,

509
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,710
<22-7,Thirteen>虽然不会对病人有任何帮助
<22-7,Thirteen>which won't actually do anything to help the patient

510
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:21,690
<22-7,Thirteen>但至少能为我们继续猜测她的病因
<22-7,Thirteen>except maybe give us enough time to come up with a guess

511
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,410
<22-7,Thirteen>提供足够的时间
<22-7,Thirteen>as to what's actually wrong with her.

512
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:26,440
<22-8,House>这听上去有道理多了
<22-8,House>Oh, that makes more sense.

513
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:28,860
<22-9,Thirteen>我之所以闯进来是因为卡迪和威尔森
<22-9,Thirteen>And I broke in here because Cuddy and Wilson

514
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,880
<22-9,Thirteen>分别找到我  让我这么做的
<22-9,Thirteen>both separately asked me to.

515
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:33,140
<22-10,House>更有道理了
<22-10,House>Even more logical.

516
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,670
<22-11,Thirteen>这不是海洛因
<22-11,Thirteen>And that's not heroin,

517
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:38,760
<22-11,Thirteen>就是说你知道我会过来
<22-11,Thirteen>which means you knew I was coming over here,

518
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,340
<22-11,Thirteen>而卡迪和威尔森是对的
<22-11,Thirteen>and Cuddy and Wilson are right.

519
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:41,490
<22-11,Thirteen>你只是在耍我们
<22-11,Thirteen>You're just playing a game.

520
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,260
<22-11,Thirteen>扔了块骨头想看我们如何你争我夺
<22-11,Thirteen>Throwing out a bone and watching us fight over it.

521
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,750
<22-12,House>还有一个理论
<22-12,House>There is another theory.

522
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,620
<22-12,House>化合物CS-804
<22-12,House>Compound cs-804.

523
00:22:57,930 --> 00:22:59,530
<22-12,House>是一种试验药物
<22-12,House>It's an experimental drug

524
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,430
<22-12,House>理论上可以使肌肉再生
<22-12,House>that's supposed to regrow muscle.

525
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,960
<22-13,Thirteen>这实验是在老鼠身上做的
<22-13,Thirteen>This experiment was done on rats.

526
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:12,230
<22-14,House>这药取得了突破性进展  是巨大的成功
<22-14,House>It's groundbreaking. Huge success.

527
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,990
<22-15,Thirteen>只是在老鼠上
<22-15,Thirteen>In rats.

528
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:18,030
<22-16,House>它们还有四条腿呢
<22-16,House>Well, they got four legs.

529
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:20,760
<22-16,House>要是只有一条腿的话  岂不是更有效
<22-16,House>Think how fast it should work on one.

530
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:27,110
<22-16,House>你真是个傻瓜
<22-16,House>You're an idiot.

531
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:49,990
<23-1,Chase>出问题了
<23-1,Chase>We've got a problem.

532
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,410
<23-2,Taub>除颤仪不工作了吗
<23-2,Taub>AICD not working?

533
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:53,220
<23-3,Chase>如果是那个问题  我会检查别的部位
<23-3,Chase>If it's the defibrillator, I'd be looking elsewhere.

534
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,480
<23-3,Chase>闻上去像出血
<23-3,Chase>Smells like bleeding.

535
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:55,460
<23-4,Taub>直肠出血吗
<23-4,Taub>Rectal?

536
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:57,100
<23-5,Chase>还有阴道出血
<23-5,Chase>And vaginal.

537
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:00,540
<24-1,Foreman>有没有可能是在手术过程中造成了穿孔
<24-1,Foreman>Is it possible something got perforated during surgery?

538
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:02,040
<24-2,Taub>你这是指责吗
<24-2,Taub>Is that an accusation?

539
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,450
<24-3,Foreman>更像是提问
<24-3,Foreman>Sounded like a question.

540
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:05,140
<24-3,Foreman>就是个简单的问题
<24-3,Foreman>Just a straightforward inquiry

541
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:07,060
<24-3,Foreman>只有心里有鬼的人
<24-3,Foreman>that only someone with serious insecurities

542
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:07,940
<24-3,Foreman>才会有此疑问吧
<24-3,Foreman>would take issue with.

543
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:11,060
<24-4,Taub>好吧  要回答你这个问题
<24-4,Taub>Okay, so in answering, I have to decide

544
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,970
<24-4,Taub>我只有两种选择
<24-4,Taub>between the only two possibilities.

545
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:16,150
<24-4,Taub>"没有"以及"没错  我们可能搞砸了
<24-4,Taub>"No." And "Yes, we might have screwed something up,

546
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,420
<24-4,Taub>但却故意隐瞒事实
<24-4,Taub>but are intentionally hiding it

547
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:19,970
<24-4,Taub>因为我们是不称职的混蛋"
<24-4,Taub>because we're incompetent and we're asses."

548
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,030
<24-4,Taub>我的答案是  没有
<24-4,Taub>Answer is "No."

549
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,000
<24-4,Taub>我们的手术一切正常
<24-4,Taub>Glad we didn't shortchange that avenue.

550
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,380
<24-4,Taub>可能是血液病
<24-4,Taub>It's a blood disorder.

551
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:26,460
<24-5,Foreman>-凝血技能障碍  -那不能作为诊断
<24-5,Foreman>- A coagulopathy. - That's not a diagnosis.

552
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:27,850
<24-5,Foreman>那就跟说她在流鼻涕一样太笼统了
<24-5,Foreman>That's like saying she has a runny nose.

553
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:29,610
<24-6,Taub>没错  但如果不擦鼻涕的话
<24-6,Taub>True, but not saying she has a runny nose

554
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,370
<24-6,Taub>就会弄得到处都是  不可收拾
<24-6,Taub>risks getting snot all over us.

555
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:33,320
<24-7,Foreman>-我们可着手治疗  -病因可能还是中毒
<24-7,Foreman>- We can treat it. - Cause could still be a toxin.

556
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,900
<24-7,Foreman>鬼知道她以前有什么毒物暴露史...
<24-7,Foreman>She must have been exposed to who knows--

557
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:36,430
<24-8,Thirteen>那也是过去时  就是说她应该有所好转
<24-8,Thirteen>Past tense, which means she would have been better

558
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:37,500
<24-8,Thirteen>但实际没有
<24-8,Thirteen>now that she's not.

559
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,220
<24-9,Chase>豪斯也一样
<24-9,Chase>Same goes for House.

560
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:41,880
<24-9,Chase>如果这次是因为卡迪
<24-9,Chase>If this was about Cuddy,

561
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,140
<24-9,Chase>他几周前就该这样了
<24-9,Chase>he would have checked out weeks ago.

562
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,280
<24-9,Chase>肯定发生了什么新的问题
<24-9,Chase>Something else is going on. Something new.

563
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:47,750
<24-10,Taub>他这是感情问题处理不好的正常表现
<24-10,Taub>That's an awfully simplistic approach to matters of the heart.

564
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:49,310
<24-11,Chase>豪斯是理智的  他很得意于此
<24-11,Chase>House is rational. He prides himself--

565
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:50,780
<24-12,Taub>没人能理智地处理感情
<24-12,Taub>No one is rational about emotion.

566
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:52,360
<24-12,Taub>这也是感情被称为感情的原因
<24-12,Taub>That's why they're emotions.

567
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:53,330
<24-13,Foreman>你觉得呢
<24-13,Foreman>What do you think?

568
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:56,030
<24-14,Thirteen>-我  我什么都没说  -正是如此
<24-14,Thirteen>- Me? I didn't say anything. - Exactly.

569
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,090
<24-15,Foreman>对这类事你总有自己的见解
<24-15,Foreman>You always have some opinion on these things,

570
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,280
<24-16,Thirteen>尤其是对豪斯
<24-16,Thirteen>especially when it comes to House,

571
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,290
<24-16,Thirteen>谈及男人加上感情  你更是如此
<24-16,Thirteen>double especially when it comes to men and romance,

572
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:03,170
<24-16,Thirteen>但突然间你却如此沉默
<24-16,Thirteen>but suddenly you're keeping your mouth shut.

573
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:09,600
<24-17,Thirteen>豪斯帮不了我们
<24-17,Thirteen>House can't help us.

574
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:12,950
<24-17,Thirteen>无论有多蠢  我都尊重他的隐私
<24-17,Thirteen>I respect his privacy, no matter how stupid and

575
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:15,040
<24-17,Thirteen>我希望你们也能尊重我的隐私
<24-17,Thirteen>I'd appreciate it if you'd respect mine.

576
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:22,050
<24-18,Foreman>我们需要对症下药才行
<24-18,Foreman>We need to treat the underlying condition.

577
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,230
<24-18,Foreman>可能是癌症  败血症  创伤
<24-18,Foreman>Could be cancer, sepsis, trauma,

578
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,820
<24-18,Foreman>肝病  出血热
<24-18,Foreman>liver disease, hemorrhagic fever--

579
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,190
<24-19,Taub>我要去对症治疗了
<24-19,Taub>I'm gonna start treating the symptoms

580
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,460
<24-19,Taub>你就慢慢列出所有可能的病因吧
<24-19,Taub>while you finish listing the possible causes.

581
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:10,240
<25-1,Riggin>老鼠的实验结果不错
<25-1,Riggin>The rats are doing great.

582
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:12,180
<25-2,House>"不错"这说法有点含糊不清
<25-2,House>"Great" is a little vague.

583
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:14,060
<25-3,Riggin>比以前的研究成果要好
<25-3,Riggin>Even better than the previous study.

584
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:15,930
<25-3,Riggin>力量加强了12%
<25-3,Riggin>12% increase in strength,

585
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:18,500
<25-3,Riggin>灵活度增强了22%
<25-3,Riggin>22% in flexibility, and some improvement

586
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:20,490
<25-3,Riggin>至少60%的实验鼠都有所改善
<25-3,Riggin>in at least 60% of the subjects.

587
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:22,720
<25-4,House>你做最大耐药性的实验了吗
<25-4,House>Have you done maximum tolerated dose studies?

588
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:23,760
<25-4,House>还没
<25-4,House>Not yet.

589
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:25,140
<25-5,Riggin>但这正是这种药物的美妙之处
<25-5,Riggin>But that's part of the beauty.

590
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,910
<25-5,Riggin>这种化合物很容易从尿中排出
<25-5,Riggin>Since the compound is easily excreted in urine,

591
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,410
<25-5,Riggin>因此只要别让他们脱水
<25-5,Riggin>as long as they keep hydrated,

592
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,710
<25-5,Riggin>理论上任何剂量都应该
<25-5,Riggin>there's really no reason to expect any danger

593
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,330
<25-5,Riggin>没什么危险
<25-5,Riggin>at virtually any dose.

594
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:36,060
<25-5,Riggin>我的意思是  很明显谁也不敢打包票
<25-5,Riggin>I mean, obviously you can't know for sure.

595
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,850
<25-6,House>但如果用上了"明显"这种词
<25-6,House>But if it's worthy of the preface "obviously,"

596
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:41,080
<25-6,House>那很明显  只要向傻瓜解释就行
<25-6,House>then obviously it only needs to be explained to idiots.

597
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:42,480
<25-6,House>我像傻瓜吗
<25-6,House>Do I look like an idiot?

598
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:48,110
<25-6,House>不好意思
<25-6,House>Sorry.

599
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:49,450
<25-6,House>我心情不好
<25-6,House>Cranky.

600
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:51,720
<25-6,House>我的意思是说
<25-6,House>What I meant to say was:

601
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:53,600
<25-6,House>为什么科学家们没有粉丝团呢
<25-6,House>Why don't scientists have groupies?

602
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:55,950
<25-6,House>如果没人告诉我你只是个拿薪水的呆子
<25-6,House>'cause I'd do you right now if society wasn't telling me

603
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,970
<25-6,House>我一定会疯狂的崇拜你的
<25-6,House>that you're just an underpaid dork.

604
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:00,780
<25-7,Riggin>谢谢
<25-7,Riggin>Thank you.

605
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:04,780
<25-8,Riggin>你还好吗
<25-8,Riggin>You all right?

606
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,520
<25-9,House>腿疼
<25-9,House>Leg hurts.

607
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:10,600
<25-9,House>你能给我拿杯咖啡吗
<25-9,House>Would you mind getting me a coffee?

608
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,910
<25-10,Riggin>咖啡能减缓你的腿部疼痛吗
<25-10,Riggin>How does coffee help your leg?

609
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:17,030
<25-11,House>至少能让我免去拿咖啡的这段路
<25-11,House>It will prevent me from walking to get the coffee.

610
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,600
<25-12,Riggin>好吧
<25-12,Riggin>Right.

611
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,120
<26-1,Taub>呼叫上说她嘴里开始流血了
<26-1,Taub>Page said she's now bleeding from her mouth.

612
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:48,130
<26-2,Foreman>你开始治疗了吗
<26-2,Foreman>You start treatment?

613
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,250
<26-3,Taub>我说过我会开始治疗
<26-3,Taub>I said I would.

614
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,820
<26-4,Foreman>直接回答"是"就可以了
<26-4,Foreman>A "Yes" would have been fine.

615
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,590
<26-5,Taub>你别问这问题更好
<26-5,Taub>Not asking the question would have been even better.

616
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:55,430
<26-6,Foreman>有呼吸问题吗
<26-6,Foreman>Any breathing issues?

617
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,060
<26-7,Lee>没有  但是
<26-7,Lee>No, but--

618
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,140
<26-8,Gibbs>我感觉不是腹部问题
<26-8,Gibbs>I'm not sure it's internal.

619
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,570
<26-9,Taub>如果是从两边开始  就是腹部问题
<26-9,Taub>If it's coming from both ends, it's internal.

620
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,970
<26-10,Gibbs>她的牙龈看起来像是被烫伤了
<26-10,Gibbs>Her gums look like they were burned.

621
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,000
<27-1,Wilson>你在用试验性药物吗
<27-1,Wilson>Experimental drugs?

622
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,240
<27-2,House>你这么说不公平
<27-2,House>That's unfair.

623
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:40,270
<27-2,House>因为就算是维柯丁  也是试验性药物
<27-2,House>Because at one point, even Vicodin was an experimental drug.

624
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:41,350
<27-2,House>我得走了
<27-2,House>I have to go.

625
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,520
<27-3,Wilson>除非你要去上班
<27-3,Wilson>Well,unless you're going to do your job,

626
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:45,120
<27-4,House>-其它的事可以等等  -我是要去上班
<27-4,House>- it can wait. - I'm going to do my job.

627
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:46,130
<27-5,Wilson>那我开车送你去
<27-5,Wilson>I'll give you a lift.

628
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,940
<27-6,House>我就给你两分钟
<27-6,House>I'll give you two minutes.

629
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,540
<27-6,House>但是首先我要告诉你  我停用那种药了
<27-6,House>But first, I'm gonna tell you that I'm off the drugs,

630
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,840
<27-6,House>之后你会感觉你很傻
<27-6,House>and you'll feel silly

631
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:56,670
<27-6,House>因为你不知道接下来两分钟你要说什么
<27-6,House>'cause you've got nothing to say for two minutes.

632
00:29:58,710 --> 00:29:59,710
<27-7,Wilson>你为什么停药了
<27-7,Wilson>Why are you off them?

633
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,710
<27-8,House>因为它们不起作用
<27-8,House>Because they don't work.

634
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:01,590
<27-9,Wilson>那你最初为什么开始用呢
<27-9,Wilson>Why were you on them?

635
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:03,760
<27-10,House>因为那药是香蕉口味的
<27-10,House>Because they come in banana flavor.

636
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,770
<27-10,House>你知道答案的
<27-10,House>You know the answer.

637
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:09,900
<27-11,Wilson>你认为治好你的腿就能拯救你的生活
<27-11,Wilson>You think fixing your leg will fix your life.

638
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:12,060
<27-12,House>我认为如果生活的一部分  尤其是
<27-12,House>I think that my life will be somewhat better

639
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,540
<27-12,House>我的腿好一些  我的生活就会好一些
<27-12,House>if part of my life, specifically my leg, is somewhat better.

640
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:18,140
<27-13,Wilson>你把你所有的问题都归结为你的腿
<27-13,Wilson>You think all your problems are your leg.

641
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:19,190
<27-14,House>你大老远过来  就是为了告诉我
<27-14,House>And you're here to tell me that no matter

642
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:21,270
<27-14,House>不管我的腿怎样  生活都会继续郁闷
<27-14,House>how depressed I may be, it's not enough.

643
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:23,510
<27-15,Wilson>我认为你希望所有的东西
<27-15,Wilson>I think you want everything

644
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:25,550
<27-15,Wilson>都是有形的  简单的
<27-15,Wilson>to be physical, tangible, simple.

645
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:27,800
<27-15,Wilson>希望有一剂能治疗不幸的良药
<27-15,Wilson>You want unhappiness to have a cure.

646
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,170
<27-15,Wilson>豪斯  你显然...
<27-15,Wilson>House, you obviously--

647
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:30,500
<27-16,House>我痛恨那个词
<27-16,House>I hate that word.

648
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:32,210
<27-16,House>现在我必须得走了
<27-16,House>I have to go now.

649
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,040
<27-16,House>事实上  并非必须
<27-16,House>Actually, I don't,

650
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,520
<27-16,House>但是如果一声不吭就离开很没礼貌
<27-16,House>but it would be rude to walk out without saying anything.

651
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:38,130
<27-16,House>这个怎么样
<27-16,House>What about this?

652
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:40,010
<28-1,Chase>28岁女性因念珠菌感染
<28-1,Chase>28-year-old woman presenting with burn-like wounds

654
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:43,250
<28-5,Foreman>有意思
<28-5,Foreman>Interesting.

655
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:45,860
<28-2,Foreman>如果她也有癫痫症状才和咱们的病人相关
<28-2,Foreman>It would also be relevant if the woman had had seizures.

656
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:47,430
<28-2,Foreman>如果有真菌进入她的血流中...
<28-2,Foreman>If the fungus had entered her bloodstream--

657
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:48,380
<28-3,Thirteen>要是那样  我们会在血检中发现的
<28-3,Thirteen>We would have seen it in the blood work.

658
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,750
<28-4,Taub>急性髓系白血病

660
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:52,340
<28-5,Foreman>一样  很有意思但是不相关
<28-5,Foreman>Again, interesting but not relevant.

661
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:53,460
<28-6,Taub>我也再说一次  你就是个混蛋
<28-6,Taub>Again, you're being an ass.

662
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,860
<28-7,Foreman>她家族里没有血液病史
<28-7,Foreman>She doesn't have a history of blood diseases in her family,

663
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:56,880
<28-7,Foreman>她的血细胞计数正常
<28-7,Foreman>Her blood count's normal,

664
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,880

<28-9,Chase>她和她男朋友在一起工作
<28-9,Chase>She works most closely with is also her boyfriend.

667
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,620
<28-9,Chase>你觉得如果有化学药品打翻之类的事故
<28-9,Chase>You don't think he would have told us

668
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:06,450
<28-9,Chase>他会不告诉我们吗
<28-9,Chase>if there had been some sort of chemical spill or accident?

669
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:08,900
<28-10,Thirteen>还有一个因素会引起急性髓系白血病
<28-10,Thirteen>There is one other cause of A.M.L..

00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,490
<29-1,Cesar>等等  你要带她去哪
<29-1,Cesar>Wait! Where are you taking her?

671
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:15,770
<29-2,Foreman>我们应该把她带到隔离室
<29-2,Foreman>We need to get her into an isolation room

672
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:18,140
<29-2,Foreman>然后为造血干细胞移植手术做准备
<29-2,Foreman>and prep for a hematopoietic stem cell transplant.

673
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:19,240
<29-3,Cesar>隔离  为什么
<29-3,Cesar>Isolation? Why?

674
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,620
<29-4,Thirteen>我们认为电离辐射
<29-4,Thirteen>We think her blood and immune system

675
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:23,050
<29-4,Thirteen>摧毁了她的血液和免疫系统
<29-4,Thirteen>have been destroyed by an exposure to ionizing radiation.

00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:24,410
<29-5,Cesar>但是我们工作不会接触辐射
<29-5,Cesar>But we don't work with radiation.

677
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:25,600
<29-6,Thirteen>显然你的女朋友有
<29-6,Thirteen>Well, apparently your girlfriend does.

<29-7,Cesar>不  她没有  你们错了

679
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,690
<29-7,Cesar>一定是其它原因
<29-7,Cesar>It must be something else.

680
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:30,730
<29-8,Thirteen>我们发现你们的公司在研制
<29-8,Thirteen>We found reports that your company was developing

00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:35,220
<29-9,Cesar>还是有幻想症的白痴的博客
<29-9,Cesar>Some paranoid idiot's blog?

684

<29-9,Cesar>我不管你在哪看的  那不是真的
<29-9,Cesar>I don't care where you read it. It's not true.

685
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:38,240
<29-10,Foreman>你是说在你们公司里  绝对没有人
<29-10,Foreman>You're saying there's absolutely no chance

686
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,620
<29-10,Foreman>在你毫不知情的情况下
<29-10,Foreman>that anyone in your company is doing

<29-11,Cesar>不  但是我了解温迪  她不会的
<29-11,Cesar>No, but I know Wendy and she wouldn't.

689
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:46,650
<29-12,Thirteen>你可能并不像你想的那样了解她
<29-12,Thirteen>Well, maybe you don't know her as well as you thought you did.

690
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:48,420
<29-13,Foreman>请让一下  我们得走了

00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,510
<32-2,House>你会癫痫发作
<32-2,House>You're just gonna have a seizure,

721
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,340
<32-2,House>这证明你的肾脏没有正常工作
<32-2,House>which will prove that your kidneys are not working,

722
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:16,310
<32-2,House>就是说在周六晚上  它也没有正常工作
<32-2,House>which will also prove that they weren't working Saturday night.

723
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:19,490
<32-2,House>这就是为什么轻轻一击
<32-2,House>That's why a glancing body blow

724
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,640
<32-2,House>就使你的血压降低
<32-2,House>sent your blood pressure into the toilet

725
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:23,240
<32-2,House>也把你打倒在地
<32-2,House>and you onto the canvas.

726
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:28,010
<32-3,Foley>应该要喝多少瓶水
<32-3,Foley>How many bottles is this supposed to take?

727
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:29,070
<32-4,House>六瓶
<32-4,House>Six.

728
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:31,160
<32-5,Foley>那我喝了多少了
<32-5,Foley>And I've drank how many?

729
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,380
<32-6,House>八瓶
<32-6,House>Eight.

730
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:34,770
<32-6,House>理论并不准确
<32-6,House>It's not an exact science.

731
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:38,000
<32-7,Foley>或者说是  什么都没法证明你是错的
<32-7,Foley>So in other words, nothing's gonna prove you wrong.

732
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,630
<32-7,Foley>你会不停地来折磨骚扰我
<32-7,Foley>You're just gonna keep making me miserable

733
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:40,800
<32-7,Foley>因为你的生活也不顺
<32-7,Foley>because you're too miserable--

734
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,270
<32-7,Foley>你是个白痴
<32-7,Foley>You're an idiot.

735
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,230
<32-8,House>得了  你不会打我的
<32-8,House>No, you're not gonna hit me...

736
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:49,420
<32-8,House>因为在你不堪一击的脑袋里
<32-8,House>'cause somewhere deep in that way-too-thin skull of yours

737
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:51,250
<32-8,House>你知道自己一无是处
<32-8,House>you know that you're full of crap.

738
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:52,820
<32-8,House>这就是你停下慢跑的原因
<32-8,House>That's why you stopped jogging for me.

739
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,870
<32-8,House>也是你喝八瓶水的原因
<32-8,House>That's why you drank eight bottles.

740
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:57,040
<32-8,House>你一方面希望我是错的
<32-8,House>Because even though you want to think that I'm wrong

741
00:33:57,050 --> 00:33:58,280
<32-8,House>因为这让生活变得简单
<32-8,House>'cause it's simpler,

742
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,980
<32-8,House>另一方面  你又渴望我是对的
<32-8,House>you also desperately want me to be right.

743
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:06,800
<32-9,Foley>如果我错了
<32-9,Foley>I'm only an ass

744
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,920
<32-8,House>给你空筑希望  那我才真是个混蛋
<32-8,House>for building your hopes up if I'm wrong.

745
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:11,630
<32-8,House>最后一瓶了
<32-8,House>Last one.

746
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:32,910
<32-9,Foley>你就是个混蛋
<32-9,Foley>You're an ass.

747
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:49,960
<33-1,Wilson>你错了
<33-1,Wilson>You were wrong.

748
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,590
<33-1,Wilson>这又不是世界末日
<33-1,Wilson>It's not the end of the world.

749
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:56,350
<33-2,House>你还想说什么
<33-2,House>Anything else you want to say?

750
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:00,630
<33-3,Wilson>你有问题
<33-3,Wilson>You have a problem.

751
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:03,870
<33-3,Wilson>我想如果你肯认真看待
<33-3,Wilson>I think if you seriously look at everything that--

752
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,770
<33-4,House>还想说什么
<33-4,House>Anything else?

753
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,540
<33-5,Wilson>好了  听着  这不是...
<33-5,Wilson>Okay, look, this isn't--

754
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:12,210
<33-5,Wilson>好了  好了
<33-5,Wilson>Okay! Okay! Okay! Okay!

755
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,560
<33-5,Wilson>不  我没啥要说的
<33-5,Wilson>No... I don't.

756
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,260
<33-5,Wilson>赶紧出去
<33-5,Wilson>Just get out of here.

757
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:19,670
<33-5,Wilson>回家  咱们之后再谈
<33-5,Wilson>Go home. We'll talk later.

758
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:22,280
<33-5,Wilson>找一个没有我东西的地方谈
<33-5,Wilson>Someplace without any of my stuff.

759
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:23,960
<33-6,House>没什么好谈的
<33-6,House>Nothing to talk about.

760
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:25,540
<33-6,House>这才是我想说的
<33-6,House>That was my point.

761
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:34,500
<34-1,Chase>外阴炎症
<34-1,Chase>Inflammation of the genitals

762
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,310
<34-1,Chase>证明我们的推断是错误的
<34-1,Chase>means we were wrong.

763
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:37,270
<34-2,Thirteen>多谢你道出了大家的心声
<34-2,Thirteen>Thanks for the statement of the obvious.

764
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:38,230
<34-3,Chase>你也是这么想的  不是吗
<34-3,Chase>You'd think so, wouldn't you?

765
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:40,090
<34-3,Chase>福曼还想坚持辐射中毒的理论
<34-3,Chase>Foreman wants to keep shooting for radiation poisoning.

766
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:41,530
<34-4,Foreman>因为癫痫症状消失了
<34-4,Foreman>Because the seizure's have stopped.

767
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:42,780
<34-4,Foreman>因为她不发烧了
<34-4,Foreman>Because her fever's gone away.

768
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,280
<34-4,Foreman>-因为她好转了  -只是运气而已
<34-4,Foreman>- Because she's improved. - By luck.

769
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,500
<34-5,Foreman>我病人可不关心因何而好转
<34-5,Foreman>I don't think the patient cares.

770
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,930
<34-6,Chase>是  但她还是会死只不过没那么痛苦
<34-6,Chase>Yes, she's gonna die in considerably less discomfort

771
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:49,530
<34-6,Chase>因为你只是治好了症状
<34-6,Chase>thanks to you treating a few of the symptoms

772
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,530
<34-6,Chase>而不是治愈了她的病
<34-6,Chase>instead of the disease.

773
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:52,290
<34-7,Taub>-我呼过豪  -闭嘴
<34-7,Taub>- I paged ho-- - Shut up.

774
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,950
<35-1,Bartender>你喝醉了
<35-1,Bartender>You're drunk.

775
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:57,230
<35-2,House>这算是谁的错呢
<35-2,House>Well, whose fault is that?

776
00:35:58,290 --> 00:35:59,550
<35-2,House>再给我杯苏格兰威士忌
<35-2,House>Give me another scotch.

777
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:01,040
<35-3,Bartender>我不能再卖酒给你了
<35-3,Bartender>I can't serve you.

778
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:05,090
<35-4,House>因为我是黑人吗
<35-4,House>This 'cause I'm black?

779
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:07,560
<35-4,House>但我不是  所以
<35-4,House>Cause I'm not, so...

780
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:08,500
<35-5,Bartender>兄弟  别这样
<35-5,Bartender>Come on, buddy.

781
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,230
<35-6,House>是你先卖给我酒  让我喝醉了
<35-6,House>Look, you can't get me drunk and then

782
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:11,770
<35-6,House>现在又唠叨  不让我喝
<35-6,House>give me crap for being drunk.

783
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:13,120
<35-6,House>这跟和甩了别人以后
<35-6,House>That's like dumping someone

784
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,930
<35-6,House>还假惺惺地安慰她  有什么不同
<35-6,House>and then giving them crap for being upset.

785
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:16,640
<35-6,House>这可不是什么高尚的行为
<35-6,House>That's just not decent.

786
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:23,410
<35-6,House>我来解释下大家为什么来这里
<35-6,House>Let me explain why people come here.

787
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:25,700
<35-6,House>他们是过来喝酒的
<35-6,House>They come here to drink.

788
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:28,180
<35-6,House>于是我们就要问了  为什么人们要喝酒
<35-6,House>Which causes us to ask, why do people drink?

789
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:30,860
<35-6,House>酒是粮食吗
<35-6,House>Is it sustenance?

790
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:35,600
<35-6,House>不是  它好喝吗
<35-6,House>No. Is it taste?

791
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:39,270
<35-7,Fellow Patron>-不好喝  -别混蛋了
<35-7,Fellow Patron>- No. - Don't be a jerk.

792
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:42,020
<35-8,House>是为了见这些所谓勇敢的酒友吗
<35-8,House>Is it the company of stout-hearted men?

793
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,550
<35-8,House>我觉得不是
<35-8,House>I don't think so.

794
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:45,660
<35-8,House>它能抚平痛苦吗
<35-8,House>Is it killing pain?

795
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:48,150
<35-8,House>没错
<35-8,House>Yes.

796
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:51,430
<35-8,House>7.5%的酒精能帮你抚平伤口
<35-8,House>7 1/2% life duller.

797
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,780
<35-8,House>这就是酒吧的实质
<35-8,House>That's the business you're in.

798
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:56,040
<35-8,House>人们以喝酒来发泄对世界的怨气
<35-8,House>You're in the "Screw the world" business.

799
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,590
<35-8,House>喝醉了  就能暂时逃避现实
<35-8,House>You're in the "Reality sucks

800
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,860
<35-8,House>醉生梦死一番
<35-8,House>and fantasy temporarily appears to not suck" business.

801
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:03,650
<35-9,Fellow Patron>就给这白痴一杯酒吧  让他闭嘴
<35-9,Fellow Patron>Just get the moron a drink so he'll shut the hell up.

802
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:08,300
<35-10,House>不要
<35-10,House>No.

803
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:13,290
<35-11,Bartender>-我给你酒了啊  -你没有尊严吗
<35-11,Bartender>- I'm giving you your drink. - Have you no pride?

804
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:17,110
<35-12,House>你可以选择给或者不给
<35-12,House>Either serving me is a good idea or it's a bad idea.

805
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:19,250
<35-12,House>但不能为了"让我闭嘴"这种烂理由
<35-12,House>Shutting me up is a crappy reason

806
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:20,780
<35-12,House>而对你的信念妥协
<35-12,House>for compromising what you believe.

807
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,800
<35-13,Fellow Patron>很显然  就这样你也不会闭嘴
<35-13,Fellow Patron>Not even an effective one apparently.

808
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:32,510
<35-14,House>我是不是得揍他了啊
<35-14,House>Am I gonna have to hit him?

809
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:34,080
<35-15,Bartender>这不是个好主意
<35-15,Bartender>Not a good idea.

810
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:37,450
<35-16,House>但如果这么做才是正确的呢
<35-16,House>But what if it's the right thing to do?

811
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:41,180
<35-16,House>妥协永远不是解决之道
<35-16,House>Compromise is never the answer.

812
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:44,990
<35-16,House>站起来
<35-16,House>Stand up.

813
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:50,490
<35-16,House>我会让你击第一拳
<35-16,House>I will allow you to throw the first punch.

814
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:52,380
<35-17,Fellow Patron>坐下
<35-17,Fellow Patron>Sit down.

815
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:53,870
<35-17,Fellow Patron>我不会打你的
<35-17,Fellow Patron>I'm not gonna hit you.

816
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:56,540
<35-18,House>太好了  其实我刚是骗你的
<35-18,House>Just as well, 'cause I was lying.

817
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,780
<36-1,Thirteen>你可以不用担心了
<36-1,Thirteen>You can relax.

818
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,110
<36-2,Cesar>她开始好转了吗
<36-2,Cesar>She's getting better?

819
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:18,100
<36-3,Chase>坏消息是  因为你一直在她身边
<36-3,Chase>Bad news is, because of your extended exposure to her

820
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,360
<36-3,Chase>和她在一起工作
<36-3,Chase>and her workplace,

821
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:21,260
<36-3,Chase>我们也要对你进行治疗
<36-3,Chase>we're gonna need to treat you as well.

822
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,040
<36-4,Cesar>我感觉很好啊
<36-4,Cesar>I feel fine.

823
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:24,040
<36-5,Thirteen>不幸的是  这是处理辐射中毒的规定
<36-5,Thirteen>Unfortunately that's the way it can be with radiation.

824
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,090
<36-5,Thirteen>等有症状出现再治疗  就太晚了
<36-5,Thirteen>No symptoms until it's too late to do anything.

825
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:28,170
<36-6,Chase>你将需要骨髓移植
<36-6,Chase>You're gonna need a bone marrow transplant.

826
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,250
<36-7,Cesar>-不  -骨髓移植确实会给你带来
<36-7,Cesar>- No. - A marrow transplant does leave you exposed

827
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:32,270
<36-8,Thirteen>感染各种疾病的危险
<36-8,Thirteen>to all sorts of illnesses,

828
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,940
<36-8,Thirteen>但真的没有别的好办法了
<36-8,Thirteen>but there really is no choice here.

829
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:35,450
<36-9,Cesar>她并没有辐射中毒
<36-9,Cesar>She doesn't have radiation poisoning.

830
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:36,380
<36-10,Chase>她正在好转
<36-10,Chase>She's getting better.

831
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:37,440
<36-11,Thirteen>在情况变遭之前
<36-11,Thirteen>We need to start your treatment

832
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,180
<36-11,Thirteen>我们要开始你的治疗
<36-11,Thirteen>before it's too late.

833
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:39,180
<36-12,Cesar>不
<36-12,Cesar>No.

834
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,380
<36-13,Chase>你要不然是有自杀倾向
<36-13,Chase>You're either suicidal

835
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:46,770
<36-13,Chase>要不然就是知道我们是错的
<36-13,Chase>or you know we're wrong.

836
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,220
<36-13,Chase>而你之所以会如此确信  我们诊断错了
<36-13,Chase>And the only way you could know for sure

837
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:53,150
<36-13,Chase>是因为你知道令她垂死的真正病因
<36-13,Chase>what wasn't killing her is if you knew what was.

838
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,110
<36-13,Chase>而且你确实知道  不是吗
<36-13,Chase>And you do, don't you?

839
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,150
<36-14,Thirteen>因为就是你下的毒
<36-14,Thirteen>Because you've been poisoning her

840
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:58,260
<36-14,Thirteen>而她好转的原因就是
<36-14,Thirteen>and the reason she's getting better

841
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:00,440
<36-14,Thirteen>你不在她身边了
<36-14,Thirteen>is because you haven't been near her.

842
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:02,190
<36-15,Chase>我们的同事正在去你家的路上
<36-15,Chase>Our co-workers are on their way

843
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:04,150
<36-15,Chase>去搜寻毒药
<36-15,Chase>to your home right now to search for poisons.

844
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:05,270
<36-15,Chase>别再浪费大家的时间了吧
<36-15,Chase>You mind saving them the trouble?

845
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:07,750
<36-16,Thirteen>谋杀未遂总比谋杀好
<36-16,Thirteen>Attempted murder is better than murder.

846
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,770
<37-1,Foley>你在这里干什么
<37-1,Foley>What are you doing here?

847
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:58,290
<37-2,House>为我的决胜之战进行训练
<37-2,House>Training for my big fight.

848

<37-2,House>只需要你
<37-2,House>Just need you to--

849
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:01,040
<37-3,Foley>再喝五瓶水吗
<37-3,Foley>Drink five more bottles?

850
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,890
<37-3,Foley>再被揍几拳吗
<37-3,Foley>Get punched a few more times?

851
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:05,130
<37-3,Foley>你就放弃吧  赶紧滚吧
<37-3,Foley>Look, just get out and give up.

852
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,550
<37-4,House>只有你才会临阵退缩
<37-4,House>That's your specialty.

853
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:11,960
<37-5,Foley>你这决胜之战看来是没戏了
<37-5,Foley>Looks like you already lost your big fight.

854
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,260
<37-5,Foley>听着  我也许被别人揍一拳就倒了
<37-5,Foley>Look, I may not be able to take a punch,

855
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:17,160
<37-5,Foley>但我还是能揍你的
<37-5,Foley>but I can still throw one.

856
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,300
<37-6,House>三  二

<37-6,House>今天真是太美好了
<37-6,House>What a lovely day.

858
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:36,290
<38-1,Lee>塞萨尔在哪里
<38-1,Lee>Where's Cesar?

859
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,420
<38-2,Thirteen>在监狱里
<38-2,Thirteen>In jail.

860
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:45,230
<38-2,Thirteen>他企图谋杀你
<38-2,Thirteen>He was trying to kill you.

861
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,990
<38-2,Thirteen>他发现你和格伦的事情了
<38-2,Thirteen>He found out about you and Glenn,

862
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:51,150
<38-2,Thirteen>他承认他本不该觉得惊讶的
<38-2,Thirteen>which, he admitted, shouldn't have surprised him

863
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:52,810
<38-2,Thirteen>因为他开始和你约会时
<38-2,Thirteen>since he started seeing you

864
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:54,470
<38-2,Thirteen>你还在和托尼约会
<38-2,Thirteen>while you were dating Tony.

865
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,300
<38-3,Lee>他对我投毒吗
<38-3,Lee>He poisoned me?

866
00:40:57,730 --> 00:41:00,790
<38-4,Thirteen>反复地  用的是斑蝥
<38-4,Thirteen>Repeatedly... with spanish fly.

867
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:03,550
<38-4,Thirteen>所含的活性斑蝥素是种强效毒药
<38-4,Thirteen>The active ingredient cantharidin is a potent toxin

868
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:06,810
<38-4,Thirteen>会引起很多和辐射类似的症状
<38-4,Thirteen>and can cause a lot of the same damage as radiation.

869
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:11,450
<38-3,Lee>他竟然对我投毒吗
<38-3,Lee>He poisoned me?

870
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,190
<38-6,Thirteen>我很抱歉
<38-6,Thirteen>I'm sorry.

871
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,250
<38-7,Lee>他是能通过安全检查的
<38-7,Lee>He had a security clearance.

872
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,260
<39-1,House>这是什么
<39-1,House>What's this?

873
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:31,960
<39-1,House>一个手掌
<39-1,House>A palm.

874
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:34,760
<39-1,House>可以做很多事情
<39-1,House>Useful for many things.

875
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,380
<39-1,House>鼓掌  涂油
<39-1,House>Slapping, greasing,

876
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:38,950
<39-1,House>可能还有其它用途
<39-1,House>probably some other applications too.

877
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:41,430
<39-1,House>现在它准备好拿回那50块
<39-1,House>Right now it's ready for $50

878
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,130
<39-1,House>再羞辱你一番
<39-1,House>and humiliation.

879
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:45,010
<39-2,Wilson>他真的病了吗
<39-2,Wilson>He was actually sick?

880
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:46,210
<39-3,House>他不是被击倒的
<39-3,House>He wasn't knocked out by the punch.

881
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:48,810
<39-3,House>是因为在那拳之前  他被对手用臂钳住
<39-3,House>He was knocked out by the clinch before the punch.

882
00:41:48,810 --> 00:41:50,120
<39-3,House>对手在他颈后打了一拳
<39-3,House>Took a shot to the back of the neck.

883
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:53,060
<39-3,House>更具体地说  是血管球瘤导致的
<39-3,House>More specifically, to an abnormal growth of nerves

884
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:55,080
<39-3,House>神经的异常生长
<39-3,House>caused by a glomus tumor.

885
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,780
<39-3,House>就好比体内有把泰瑟枪[高压电击枪]
<39-3,House>Kind of like a built-in taser.

886
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:58,660
<39-3,House>对他全身造成了巨大的冲击
<39-3,House>Sent a massive shock to his entire body,

887
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:00,020
<39-3,House>使所有器官都不工作了
<39-3,House>shut everything down.

888
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:02,920
<39-4,Wilson>真难以置信
<39-4,Wilson>Fascinating.

889
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:06,070
<39-4,Wilson>完美地解释了他输掉的原因
<39-4,Wilson>Completely explains exactly how he lost.

890
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,780
<39-5,House>你最好别用这种口气说话
<39-5,House>Oh, you are not gonna be like that,

891
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:09,560
<39-5,House>因为你这还有很多海报能让我砸
<39-5,House>'cause you got a lot more posters here.

892
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,880
<39-6,Wilson>不  我没那个意思
<39-6,Wilson>No, I'm not.

893
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:13,610
<39-6,Wilson>豪斯  干得好
<39-6,Wilson>Well done, House.

894
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,110
<39-6,Wilson>你可能救了这个人一命
<39-6,Wilson>You might have saved that guy.

895
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:16,130
<39-6,Wilson>帮他起死回生了
<39-6,Wilson>Given him his life back.

896
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:18,220
<39-7,House>没有  他需要手术
<39-7,House>Oh, no. He needs surgery.

897
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:19,860
<39-7,House>他再也不能打拳击了
<39-7,House>He's never gonna fight again.

898
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,020
<39-8,Wilson>你的眼睛怎么了
<39-8,Wilson>What happened to your eye?

899
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:25,290
<39-8,Wilson>你还好吧
<39-8,Wilson>You okay?

900
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:26,700
<39-9,House>好极了
<39-9,House>Better than okay.

<39-8,Wilson>黑暗中的双眸  正注视着你*
<39-8,Wilson>*'Cause that unseen eye is watching you
