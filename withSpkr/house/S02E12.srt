00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:19,780
<1-2,Adam>酷吧?
<1-2,Adam>How cool was that?

3
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,110
<1-3,Doug>那可比酷还要厉害
<1-3,Doug>That was way cool.

4
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:27,250
<1-4,Adam>该我了
<1-4,Adam>My turn.

<1-5,Doug>就为让你坐在那后面,我刚签了15张表格
<1-5,Doug>I just signed 15 pages of forms,saying you gotta ride on the back of that thing.

7
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:33,840
<1-6,Adam>我没看见这有律师
<1-6,Adam>I don't see any lawyers around.

8
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:35,260
<1-7,Doug>你知道不是那意思
<1-7,Doug>You know that's not the point.

9
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:38,560
<1-8,Adam>不，你只是把乐趣都留给自己罢了
<1-8,Adam>No,you just wanna keep all the fun to yourself.

10
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:41,750
<1-8,Adam>拜托，爸爸
<1-8,Adam>Come on,dad.

00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,250
<1-9,Doug>你超过15迈我们就停车,好吧，我认真的
<1-9,Doug>You go over 15,we're pulling over.All right,I mean it.

12
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:47,320
<1-10,Adam>--你最好了,--好了，上车吧
<1-10,Adam>--You're the best. --All right,get on there.

13
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:49,310
<1-11,Doug>把护镜带好
<1-11,Doug>Put on your goggles.

14
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:54,470
<1-13,Doug>抓好离合了么？好儿子
<1-13,Doug>Got the clutch in? All right,that's my boy.

15
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,810
<1-14,Doug>亚当，你速度太快了,慢点
<1-14,Doug>Adam,you're going too fast. Slow it down.

16
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,270
<1-14,Doug>我认真的，你太快了,慢点
<1-14,Doug>I mean it. You're going too fast. Slow down!

17
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,450
<1-15,Doug>亚当
<1-15,Doug>Adam!

18
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,320
<1-15,Doug>亚当
<1-15,Doug>Adam!

19
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,840
<1-14,Doug>放开手闸
<1-14,Doug>Let go of the throttle!

20
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,860
<1-15,Doug>不，亚当，不
<1-15,Doug>No! Adam! No!

21
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:11,850
<2-1,Doctor>什么问题?
<2-1,Doctor>what do you got?

22
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,710
<2-2,Paramedic>16岁，身份验证，卡丁车撞车,40%身体烧伤
<2-2,Paramedic>16-year-old,status post,atv crash,40% of burns on his body.

23
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:19,080
<2-3,Doctor>肺部插管，给一袋乳酸盐,敞开套管
<2-3,Doctor>Nasotracheal intubation.Start a bag of lactated ringer's wide open.

24
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,010
<2-4,Doug>他会没事么?
<2-4,Doug>Is he gonna be okay?

25
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:22,500
<2-5,Doctor>等会儿我们跟你说,把他弄出去
<2-5,Doctor>We'll be with you when we can.Get him out.

26
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,600
<2-6,Doug>等等
<2-6,Doug>Wait,wait,wait.

27
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:27,850
<2-7,Nurse>我开始输液了,来，挪一下他
<2-7,Nurse>I'll start fluids.Let's go get him moved up.

28
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:46,770
<3-1,House>De-re-maki.De-re-maki.
<3-1,House>De-re-maki.De-re-maki.

29
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,330
<3-2,Foreman>找你呢
<3-2,Foreman>Been looking for you.

30
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,370
<3-3,House>躲着你呢，烧伤科能处理
<3-3,House>Been avoiding you. Burn unit can handle it.

31
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:57,340
<3-4,Foreman>如果他们能处理,他们就不用找你了
<3-4,Foreman>If they could handle it,they wouldn't be asking for you.

32
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,550
<3-4,Foreman>那是杂志么?
<3-4,Foreman>Is that a journal?

33
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:01,960
<3-5,House>一个朋友写了篇文章
<3-5,House>A friend wrote an article.

34
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:02,720
<3-6,Foreman>用北印度语?
<3-6,Foreman>In hindi?

35
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:05,900
<3-7,House>在印度他们有类似神经系统科学规划
<3-7,House>They have a cutting edge neuroscience program in india.

36
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,800
<3-7,House>在封面上说的不错
<3-7,House>Says so right on the cover.

37
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:14,440
<3-7,House>这小子的心律混乱
<3-7,House>This kid's heart rate's messed.

38
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,150
<3-8,Foreman>烧伤可以解释心动过速
<3-8,Foreman>Tachycardia can be explained by the burn.

39
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,510
<3-9,House>我猜烧伤科知道这个
<3-9,House>I assume the burn unit knew that.

40
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,680
<3-10,House>他钾低
<3-10,House>His potassium's low.

41
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,470
<3-11,Foreman>也可以用烧伤解释
<3-11,Foreman>Which can also be explained by the burn.

42
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:28,200
<3-12,House>只是我肯定烧伤科会给他输液
<3-12,House>Except I'm sure the burn unit's pumping him with fluids,

43
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:30,550
<3-12,House>所以他的钾该高而不是低
<3-12,House>which means his potassium should be going up,not down.

44
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:32,440
<3-13,Foreman>可能是安非他明
<3-13,Foreman>Could be amphetamines.

45
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,360
<3-14,House>或者是心脏有细菌
<3-14,House>Or bacteria lunching on his heart.

46
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:37,700
<3-14,House>或者是先天性心肌炎,类似的坏事
<3-14,House>Or cardiomyopathy,or some other very bad thing.

47
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,480
<3-14,House>他需要EKG
<3-14,House>he needs an ekg.

48
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:49,680
<3-15,House>好吧，没有皮肤，没有EKG
<3-15,House>Okay,no skin,no ekg.

49
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,720
<3-16,Chase>他到底能不能从烧伤恢复啊?
<3-16,Chase>Is he even going to survive the burn?

50
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,350
<3-17,House>你有约会么?
<3-17,House>You got a date or something?

51
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:57,310
<3-17,House>40%的身体
<3-17,House>40% of his body.

52
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:59,450
<3-17,House>如果烧伤科能防止感染
<3-17,House>If the burns unit can prevent an infection,

53
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,430
<3-17,House>他的身体能再生10%
<3-17,House>his body will regenerate maybe 10%.

54
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,640
<3-17,House>外科移皮20%
<3-17,House>Surgeon's will do 20 or so grafts.

55
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,930
<3-17,House>就在这个房间，6个月的功夫,他会弄上一身丑陋的疤
<3-17,House>Six months in this room,he'll end up with a series of nasty scars.

56
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,910
<3-17,House>也许会疼，但他能活
<3-17,House>maybe some pain,but he'll live.

57
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,770
<3-17,House>除非他的心脏罢工了,因为我们没有发现
<3-17,House>Unless his heart shuts down,because we can't figure out

58
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:15,680
<3-17,House>钾低和心动过速的原因
<3-17,House>what's causing the low potassium and tachycardia.

59
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,730
<3-17,House>我们需要一位比利时医生的帮助,他叫安索芬
<3-17,House>We need help from a belgian doc,named einthoven.

60
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:21,720
<3-18,Chase>他死了
<3-18,Chase>He's dead.

61
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:25,590
<3-19,House>在他活着的时候,他发明了一个小东西叫检流计
<3-19,House>While he was alive,he invented a little ditty called the galvanometer.

62
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,240
<3-20,Foreman>我们上哪去弄?
<3-20,Foreman>Where do we get one?

63
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,540
<3-21,House>去任何一家从1905年就开的电子商店
<3-21,House>Go to any electronics store that's been open since before 1905.

64
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,230
<3-21,House>没准他们在地下室的角落里就有一个
<3-21,House>There's a good chance they got one in the corner in the basement.

65
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,580
<4-1,Brenda>我们要设立一个声频/视频讲堂
<4-1,Brenda>we need an audio/visual setup for the lecture hall.

66
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,620
<4-2,Cuddy>为什么?
<4-2,Cuddy>What for?

67
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:40,570
<4-3,Brenda>讲座啊
<4-3,Brenda>For the lecture.

68
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,480
<4-4,Cuddy>什么讲座?
<4-4,Cuddy>What lecture?

69
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:43,190
<4-5,Brenda>韦伯博士的讲座
<4-5,Brenda>Dr. Weber's lecture.

70
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,760
<4-6,Cuddy>谁是韦伯博士?
<4-6,Cuddy>Who's dr. Weber?

71
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:47,330
<4-7,Brenda>哦，神经学者，我想
<4-7,Brenda>Uh,neurologist,I think.

72
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,350
<4-7,Brenda>备忘录是打你这来的
<4-7,Brenda>The memo was from you.

73
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,030
<4-8,Cuddy>我的助手在哪?
<4-8,Cuddy>Where's my assistant?

74
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:57,880
<4-9,Brenda>她走了
<4-9,Brenda>She left.

75
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:58,640
<4-10,Cuddy>什么时候?
<4-10,Cuddy>When?

76
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:59,360
<4-11,Brenda>周三
<4-11,Brenda>Wednesday.

77
00:04:59,450 --> 00:04:59,950
<4-12,Cuddy>真的吗?
<4-12,Cuddy>Seriously?

78
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,850
<4-13,Brenda>临时工介绍所给介绍了一个,可她走丢了
<4-13,Brenda>The temp agency sent someone,but she got lost.

79
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:05,650
<4-14,Cuddy>等她到的时候把她炒了
<4-14,Cuddy>Well,when she gets here,fire her.

80
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,360
<5-2,Cuddy>是你发的这个备忘录么?
<5-2,Cuddy>Did you issue this memo?

81
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,280
<5-3,House>看那个
<5-3,House>Look at that.

82
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,740
<5-4,Cuddy>恭喜你
<5-4,Cuddy>Congratulations.

83
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,680
<5-4,Cuddy>昏迷了两年的病人
<5-4,Cuddy>The patient that has been in a coma for two years

84
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:37,610
<5-4,Cuddy>依然昏迷
<5-4,Cuddy>and counting is still in a coma.

85
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:38,950
<5-4,Cuddy>这不是我的签字
<5-4,Cuddy>This is not my signature.

86
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,910
<5-4,Cuddy>我不知道有关这个家伙的事情
<5-4,Cuddy>I don't know anything about this guy.

87
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:44,130
<5-4,Cuddy>我需要介绍他吗? 吃午饭?
<5-4,Cuddy>I'm supposed to introduce him? Have lunch?

88
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,730
<5-4,Cuddy>昏迷病人偏头疼?
<5-4,Cuddy>The coma patient has a migraine?

89
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,870
<5-5,House>哦，不，不，我给他药,弄出来偏头疼
<5-5,House>Oh,no,no.I gave him medication to prevent a migraine.

90
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:54,550
<5-6,Cuddy>那是偏头疼,增加了他脑动脉的流动速率
<5-6,Cuddy>That's a migraine.increased flow velocity in his cerebral arteries.

91
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,770
<5-7,House>我干的，后来，给他硝酸甘油
<5-7,House>I did,subsequently,give him nitroglycerin,which could possibly

92
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:01,810
<5-8,Cuddy>你给一个昏迷病人引发偏头疼?
<5-8,Cuddy>you induced a migraine headache in a coma patient?

93
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,400
<5-9,House>我让他头疼
<5-9,House>I gave him a little headache.

94
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,550
<5-9,House>跟你现在给我的差不多
<5-9,House>Similar to the one you're giving me now.

95
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:08,440
<5-10,Cuddy>你是否读过伦理规章啊?
<5-10,Cuddy>Have you even read an ethical guideline?

96
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,410
<5-11,House>如果在有痛感的人身上尝试
<5-11,House>Well,it'd be wrong to try out a new migraine prevention

97
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,550
<5-11,House>防止疼痛的药物是不对的
<5-11,House>medication on someone who can actually feel pain.

98
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,440
<5-12,Cuddy>这是你签的吗?
<5-12,Cuddy>Did you sign this?

99
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:21,440
<5-13,House>我们一会儿再谈学科的规章吧
<5-13,House>We can talk later about the appropriate discipline.

100
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:25,610
<6-1,Cameron>因为烧伤
<6-1,Cameron>because of the burn,

101
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:28,580
<6-1,Cameron>我们无法进行常规检查探究问题
<6-1,Cameron>we can't perform any of our normal tests to see what's wrong.

102
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,140
<6-1,Cameron>所以我们要试用检流计
<6-1,Cameron>So we're going to try a galvanometer.

103
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,850
<6-2,Cameron>他可以由手腕和脚踝提取脉搏
<6-2,Cameron>It picks up a pulse in the wrists and the ankles.

104
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:38,420
<6-2,Cameron>希望能知道为什么他的心律失常
<6-2,Cameron>Hopefully it will tell us why his heart rhythm is abnormal.

105
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:40,250
<6-3,Doug>我到底是怎么害了他啊，我--
<6-3,Doug>What have I done to him.I--

106
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,470
<6-4,Emily>是事故
<6-4,Emily>it was an accident.

107
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:46,450
<6-4,Emily>好了，所以，他烧了这么多伤
<6-4,Emily>All right,so... he's got all these burns.

108
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:49,080
<6-4,Emily>然后他的心脏还有问题?
<6-4,Emily>And now there's something wrong with his heart?

109
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:51,270
<6-5,Cameron>我们在尝试找出这两者之间的关联
<6-5,Cameron>We're trying to figure out if the two are somehow connected.

110
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:53,640
<6-5,Cameron>他最近生病了吗?
<6-5,Cameron>Had he been sick lately?

111
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,060
<6-6,Emily>没有
<6-6,Emily>No,nothing.

112
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,790
<6-7,Cameron>任何非常态的举动？很疲乏？
<6-7,Cameron>Anything unusual with his behavior?Had he been tired a lot?

113
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,470
<6-8,Emily>没有，他很好，很快乐
<6-8,Emily>Nothing.He was great.He was happy.

114
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,310
<6-9,Doug>他当时很开心，然后……
<6-9,Doug>He was just having a great time and then--

115
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:06,320
<6-10,Cameron>如果他用过安非他明或可卡因…
<6-10,Cameron>if he was experimenting with amphetamines or cocaine--

116
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:10,420
<6-11,Emily>没有,一年前我们给了他些大麻尝尝
<6-11,Emily>no.We gave him some pot about a year ago to try.

117
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:11,900
<6-12,Doug>就一次
<6-12,Doug>It was just once.

118
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:14,850
<6-12,Doug>我们认为如果让他知道毒品的神秘
<6-12,Doug>We thought if we took the mystery out of drugs and alcohol,

119
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,350
<6-12,Doug>他就不会好奇了
<6-12,Doug>the less he'd experiment.

120
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,850
<6-13,Cameron>试验后我们会知道
<6-13,Cameron>We'll know more after the tests.

121
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:23,350
<6-14,Doug>看上去他们象要给他施电刑一样
<6-14,Doug>It looks like they're gonna electrocute him.

122
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:25,720
<6-15,Foreman>插进去吧
<6-15,Foreman>Plug it in.

123
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,850
<6-16,Chase>你插
<6-16,Chase>You plug it in.

124
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:32,000
<6-17,Foreman>好，给我电线
<6-17,Foreman>Fine. Gimme the cord.

125
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:39,840
<6-17,Foreman>有效的
<6-17,Foreman>Works.

126
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,520
<6-17,Foreman>U型线明显
<6-17,Foreman>Prominent u-waves.

127
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,790
<6-18,Chase>没有反转的T型线，没有缺血症状
<6-18,Chase>No inverted t-wave.no ischemia.

128
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,700
<6-19,Foreman>q型线正常
<6-19,Foreman>q-wave normal.

129
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:51,240
<6-19,Foreman>那可不好
<6-19,Foreman>That's not good.

130
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,010
<6-20,Foreman>关掉，关掉
<6-20,Foreman>Turn it off. Turn it off!

131
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:59,100
<6-22,Emily>发生什么事？怎么了？
<6-22,Emily>What's happening?What is that?

132
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:01,580
<6-23,Chase>他抽筋了，进来
<6-23,Chase>he's seizing,get in here.

133
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,440
<7-1,House>谁给我的病人施电刑了?
<7-1,House>who electrocuted my patient?

134
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,690
<7-2,Foreman>他抽搐
<7-2,Foreman>He had a seizure.

135
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:12,910
<7-3,Cameron>没人给他施电刑
<7-3,Cameron>he wasn't electrocuted.

136
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,550
<7-4,House>抽搐告诉我们什么？走开
<7-4,House>What does the seizure tell us?Move.

137
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,950
<7-5,Cameron>你找什么?
<7-5,Cameron>What are you looking for?

138
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,940
<7-6,House>跟你一样，爱和接纳
<7-6,House>Same as you. Love,acceptance.

139
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,530
<7-6,House>付出有所收获
<7-6,House>Solid return on investments.

140
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:22,410
<7-6,House>鉴别诊断，开始
<7-6,House>Differential diagnosis. Go.

141
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:24,230
<7-7,Chase>可能是癫痫或者是抽搐失调
<7-7,Chase>Could be epilepsy,or seizure disorder.

142
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:27,590
<7-8,Cameron>那样不会心动过速,可能是脑部有病毒
<7-8,Cameron>Not with the tachycardia. It could be a virus in his brain.

143
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:31,760
<7-9,Chase>厉害，肾上腺分泌失调
<7-9,Chase>Specificity's impressive. adrenoleukodystrophy.

144
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,090
<7-9,Chase>可能是M.S.
<7-9,Chase>Could be M.S.

145
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,640
<7-10,Foreman>抽搐可能由脑部外伤所致
<7-10,Foreman>Seizures could be caused by plaques and lesions on the brain.

146
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,380
<7-11,House>好，我们来找找吧，给他做核磁共振
<7-11,House>Well,let's find out which. Get him an mri.

147
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,860
<7-12,Foreman>没有核成像
<7-12,Foreman>No nuclear imaging.

148
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,770
<7-12,Foreman>他受不了往放射科搬
<7-12,Foreman>He wouldn't survive the move to radiology.

149
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:45,980
<7-12,Foreman>核磁共振跟ct都不行了
<7-12,Foreman>Mri and ct scan are both out.

150
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:49,980
<7-13,House>好，腰椎穿刺能说明问题,如果他的蛋白质提高的话
<7-13,House>Okay.Lumbar puncture'll tell us if his proteins are elevated.

151
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:51,450
<7-13,House>至少可以排除 M.S.
<7-13,House>At least we can exclude M.S.

152
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:53,900
<7-14,Chase>不能做腰椎穿刺
<7-14,Chase>Can't do a lumbar puncture either.

153
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,820
<7-15,House>你在妨碍我退场
<7-15,House>You're cramping my exits.

154
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,040
<7-15,House>别跟我说他的脊骨上没有皮肤
<7-15,House>Don't tell me,no skin on his spine.

155
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:02,030
<7-16,Chase>我们会把针头扎进个满是细菌的地方
<7-16,Chase>We'd be inserting a needle into an area that's teeming with bacteria.

156
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:04,800
<7-16,Chase>如果目前他还没有脑感染,那我们会帮他染上
<7-16,Chase>If he doesn't have a brain infection already,we'd give him one for sure.

157
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,850
<7-17,Cameron>那就没有观察大脑的方法了
<7-17,Cameron>There's no other way to look at a brain.

158
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:10,880
<7-18,House>转录多普超声波检查
<7-18,House>Transcranial doppler sonography.

159
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:14,080
<7-19,Foreman>她说的是大脑，不是孕妇的子宫
<7-19,Foreman>She said brain,not pregnant woman's uterus.

160
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,000
<7-19,Foreman>听上去挺象
<7-19,Foreman>They do sound alike.

161
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,830
<7-20,House>我今天早上用过来观察病人大脑
<7-20,House>I used one to look at a brain this morning.

162
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:19,280
<7-21,Foreman>那你干嘛不带病人,做放射检查或者是核磁共振？
<7-21,Foreman>Why didn't you take the patient to radiology,get an mra?

163
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:21,210
<7-22,House>很显然，我在做非法的事
<7-22,House>Obviously,I was doing something illegal,

164
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:24,040
<7-22,House>而用核检查方式会提高被质询的可能
<7-22,House>and using nuclear imaging would've raised questions.

165
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,650
<7-23,Foreman>你无法从语图上得到MS的诊断
<7-23,Foreman>You're not gonna get a diagnosis of M.S. From a sonogram.

166
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,780
<7-24,House>不是决定性的，可有M.S.的病人
<7-24,House>Not definitively,but patients with M.S.

167
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,750
<7-24,House>在枕叶皮层会有更多的神经反应
<7-24,House>Have more reactive neurons in their occipital cortex.

168
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:38,100
<7-24,House>好
<7-24,House>Okay

169
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:46,270
<8-1,Cuddy>谢谢你们今天光临韦伯博士的讲座
<8-1,Cuddy>Thank you for all coming to today's lecture by dr. Phillip weber,

170
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:53,270
<8-1,Cuddy>他是我们医院今天的客人,讲有关头疼的话题
<8-1,Cuddy>who is our guest today at our hospital to talk about headaches.

171
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:57,970
<8-1,Cuddy>韦伯博士在韦伯疼痛中心,这倒是有道理
<8-1,Cuddy>Dr. Weber is at the weber center for pain. That makes sense.

172
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,980
<8-1,Cuddy>韦伯，韦伯,让我们欢迎韦伯博士
<8-1,Cuddy>Weber-weber.So please welcome,dr. Weber.

173
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:12,070
<8-2,Weber>谢谢，卡迪医生
<8-2,Weber>Thank you,doctor...cuddy.

174
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:17,680
<8-2,Weber>我认为我该多告诉,你们一些关于我的情况
<8-2,Weber>I suppose I should tell you a little bit more about myself.

175
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:21,600
<8-3,Weber>我在弗吉尼亚上学
<8-3,Weber>I went to school in virginia

176
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:25,180
<8-4,Wilson>你从不来这样的地方，他到底是谁?
<8-4,Wilson>you've never to one of these things in your life. Who is this guy?

177
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,350
<8-5,House>不知道
<8-5,House>No idea.

178
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,370
<8-6,Wilson>你穿的这个样干嘛?
<8-6,Wilson>What's with the outfit?

179
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:35,120
<8-7,House>灵光闪现，寒气袭人，无法名状
<8-7,House>Sudden chills,and light sensitivity.Inexplicable.

180
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:39,310
<8-8,Weber>我在霍普金斯大学得到了医学学历
<8-8,Weber>I received my medical degree at johns hopkins university,

181
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:43,220
<8-8,Weber>我跟布曼和季马学习
<8-8,Weber>where I studied under brightman and gilmar.

182
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:48,030
<8-9,Wilson>他肯定不错，你上的霍普金斯,师从布曼和季马
<8-9,Wilson>he must be good. You went to hopkins and studied under brightman and gilmar.

183
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:52,440
<8-11,Weber>在马由诊所得了道尔奖
<8-11,Weber>helped me win the doyle internship at the mayo clinic.

184
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:55,430
<8-12,Wilson>你本该得道尔奖的
<8-12,Wilson>You were supposed to get the doyle internship.

185
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:01,730
<8-12,Wilson>这家伙是万.里博曼,把你以欺诈为理由赶出去的家伙？
<8-12,Wilson>This guy's von lieberman? The guy got you thrown out for cheating?

186
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,510
<8-13,House>是院长赶走我的
<8-13,House>The dean threw me out.

187
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,930
<8-13,House>万.里博曼不过是告密的
<8-13,House>Von lieberman just ratted on me.

188
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:08,060
<8-14,Wilson>这家伙叫韦伯，不是万.里博曼
<8-14,Wilson>This guy's name is weber,not von lieberman.

189
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:11,630
<8-15,House>我把他韦伯叫成万.里博曼,很邪恶
<8-15,House>I call weber von lieberman.Way eviler. ...

190
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,800
<8-16,Weber>而接收器
<8-16,Weber>and the receptors have

191
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:18,110
<8-16,Weber>改良了偏头疼的敏感度
<8-16,Weber>improved the acute treatment of migraines.

192
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:19,930
<8-16,Weber>根据这点...
<8-16,Weber>To this point...

193
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:21,670
<8-17,Wilson>那你的计划呢?
<8-17,Wilson>so what's the plan?

194
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,820
<8-17,Wilson>你要等他鞠躬的时候放屁吗?
<8-17,Wilson>You wanna wait 'til he bends over and make a fart sound?

195
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,710
<8-18,House>我不是要在这算旧账的
<8-18,House>I'm not here about the past.

196
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,320
<8-18,House>他是个坏科学家
<8-18,House>He's a bad scientist.

197
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,130
<8-19,Wilson>是你骗了他，他能有多坏?
<8-19,Wilson>Well,you cheated off him,how bad can he be?

198
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,350
<8-20,House>他的答案是错的
<8-20,House>He got the answer wrong.

199
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,930
<8-21,Doug>他们是要唤醒他吗?
<8-21,Doug>are they trying to wake him up?

200
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:49,040
<8-21,Doug>他们不能那样，对吗？,那样太疼了
<8-21,Doug>They can't do that,right? He'll be in too much pain.

201
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,030
<8-22,Cameron>别担心，他还没醒呢
<8-22,Cameron>Don't worry,he's still under.

202
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,440
<8-22,Cameron>但大脑并没完全睡，总是工作的
<8-22,Cameron>But the brain never completely sleeps,it's always working.

203
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:58,380
<8-22,Cameron>控制你的心跳、呼吸和温度
<8-22,Cameron>Controlling your heart rate. Breathing. Temperature.

204
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:01,220
<8-23,Cameron>眼睛会对视像做出反应
<8-23,Cameron>The eyes respond to visual stimuli.

205
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:03,470
<8-23,Cameron>血流会在大脑的特定部位加速流动
<8-23,Cameron>Blood flow increases in certain areas of the brain

206
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:05,320
<8-23,Cameron>然后我们可以用语图来追踪
<8-23,Cameron>and we can track that with a sonogram.

207
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:10,710
<8-23,Cameron>M.S.会使血管内部流动加快
<8-23,Cameron>With M.S.,Blood vessels are more reactive,so flow is faster.

208
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:12,900
<8-23,Cameron>如果亚当受了感染
<8-23,Cameron>If adam has an infection,

209
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:15,350
<8-23,Cameron>会有积水压迫动脉
<8-23,Cameron>there'd be swelling which would constrict the arteries,

210
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:17,380
<8-23,Cameron>流动就会减慢
<8-23,Cameron>and the flow would be slower.

211
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:21,040
<8-24,Foreman>小蔡，靠近蛛网膜下
<8-24,Foreman>Chase,near the subarachnoid space.

212
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,490
<9-1,Weber>控制主题的数据由双向分析
<9-1,Weber>Data from control subjects were analyzed with a two-way anova

213
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:34,320
<9-1,Weber>借主题的事实之旁证证明
<9-1,Weber>with status and side as within-subject factors.

214
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:39,760
<9-2,Wilson>你追踪了这家伙20年,就为了给他点羞辱？
<9-2,Wilson>You stalked this guy for 20 years just for the shot to humiliate him?

215
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:41,590
<9-3,House>我在学习
<9-3,House>I'm trying to learn.

216
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:43,700
<9-4,Weber>无反弹的管路
<9-4,Weber>...Vessels without significant rebound.

217
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:46,030
<9-5,House>他甚至不知道那是什么
<9-5,House>He doesn't even know what that means.

218
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:48,280
<9-6,Wilson>你要打断他，是吧?
<9-6,Wilson>You're going to interrupt him,aren't you?

219
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:49,710
<9-7,House>如果我有问题的话
<9-7,House>If I have a question.

220
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,740
<9-8,Wilson>那怎么实现呢?
<9-8,Wilson>And what's that going to accomplish?

221
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,860
<9-9,House>你不能好好享受么?
<9-9,House>Why can't you just enjoy this?

222
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,680
<9-9,House>你怎么就不能为我高兴呢?
<9-9,House>Why can't you just be happy for me?

223
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:59,640
<9-10,Wilson>你得找个比羞辱人,少削弱你精力的宣泄方式
<9-10,Wilson>You have got to find less debilitating outlets than humiliating people.

224
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,860
<9-10,Wilson>我听说保龄球挺好
<9-10,Wilson>I hear bowling is more fun than stalking.

225
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,810
<9-11,House>可我干这个更在行
<9-11,House>But I'm better at this.

226
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,780
<9-12,Weber>如果P比零点少...
<9-12,Weber>If p is less than point zero...

227
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:10,690
<9-13,Wilson>在等离子电视上花点钱
<9-13,Wilson>blow a ton of money on a plasma tv.

228
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:14,730
<9-14,Foreman>我们发现了一处蛛网膜下出血
<9-14,Foreman>We found a subarachnoid bleed.

229
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,560
<9-15,House>头部的出血不会导致抽搐
<9-15,House>Bleed in the head isn't causing seizures.

230
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,700
<9-16,Wilson>有可能，10%的大脑皮层损伤会抽搐
<9-16,Wilson>It could be.10% with damage to the cerebral cortex have seizures.

231
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,290
<9-17,Foreman>或是细菌性脑膜炎
<9-17,Foreman>Or bacterial meningitis.

232
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:24,510
<9-18,Wilson>病毒性脑炎?
<9-18,Wilson>Viral encephalitis?

233
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,580
<9-19,Foreman>无法知道……
<9-19,Foreman>There's no way to tell without--

234
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:26,770
<9-20,House>闭嘴
<9-20,House>shut up!

235
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,440
<9-21,Weber>对不起?
<9-21,Weber>Excuse me?

236
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,930
<9-22,House>不是你
<9-22,House>Not you.

237
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:35,350
<9-23,Weber>如果我的讲座打扰了你们的会议,我可以等
<9-23,Weber>If my lecture is interrupting your meeting,I can wait.

238
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:41,350
<9-24,House>象你们印度人说的，多谢了
<9-24,House>As your people say in india.Appreciate it.

239
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:45,630
<9-24,House>我们一会儿琢磨原因,止血，要不会死人的
<9-24,House>We'll figure out why later.Fix the bleed,or he dies.

240
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:47,360
<9-24,House>几小时后见
<9-24,House>Talk to you in a couple of hours.

241
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:03,870
<9-25,Chase>我在蛛网膜下部位了
<9-25,Chase>I'm in the subarachnoid space.

242
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,260
<9-26,Foreman>能弄好吗?
<9-26,Foreman>Can you get it?

243
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,580
<9-27,Chase>差不多吧
<9-27,Chase>I think so.

244
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,590
<9-27,Chase>把探针撤回来，让我看见线
<9-27,Chase>Put the probe back where it was so I can see the wire.

245
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:12,750
<9-28,Foreman>我们在找出血点
<9-28,Foreman>We're looking for the bleed--

246
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:16,380
<9-29,Chase>没有对比ct，我简直是在盲飞,帮我看着点
<9-29,Chase>look when I get there!I'm flying blind without a contrast ct here.

247
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:30,600
<9-30,Weber>当P不到0.001时
<9-30,Weber>And with a p value of less than 0.001,

248
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:34,920
<9-30,Weber>我们有强有力的证据显示,这个药带来偏头疼
<9-30,Weber>we have strong statistical evidence that this drug prevents migraine ,headaches

249
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:37,790
<9-30,Weber>不必日常摄取
<9-30,Weber>without daily administration.

250
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,670
<9-31,House>哦，对不起，医生
<9-31,House>Uh,excuse me,doctor.

251
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:41,890
<9-32,Wilson>他比你在这个领域更在行
<9-32,Wilson>He knows this field better than you do.

252
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:43,530
<9-33,House>我一直理解
<9-33,House>It's always been my understanding that

253
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:47,960
<9-33,House>除非日常摄取,否则没有药物能导致偏头疼
<9-33,House>unless you follow a daily regimen,no drug can prevent a migraine.

254
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:49,750
<9-34,Weber>所以才叫它突破
<9-34,Weber>That's why they call it a breakthrough.

255
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:52,070
<9-35,House>所以你才叫它突破
<9-35,House>That's why you call it a breakthrough.

256
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:55,170
<9-36,Weber>不，药物公司支持在我的诊所试验
<9-36,Weber>No,the pharmaceutical company sponsoring my clinical trials

257
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:57,970
<9-36,Weber>也觉得是突破
<9-36,Weber>also hails it as a breakthrough.

258
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,970
<9-37,House>我肯定你妻子跟律师也觉得是
<9-37,House>I'm sure your wife and lawyer do too.

259
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:04,530
<9-37,House>有人会在替自己赚大钱的东西面前
<9-37,House>Is there anybody who doesn't stand to make a fortune from it,

260
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,110
<9-37,House>不管它叫突破的吗？
<9-37,House>calling it a breakthrough?

261
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:06,990
<9-38,Weber>你是谁?
<9-38,Weber>Who are you?

262
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,300
<9-39,Wilson>只是个极度需要个人爱好的疯子
<9-39,Wilson>Just a lunatic who desperately needs a hobby.

263
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:11,760
<9-40,House>你到底是怎么做试验的?
<9-40,House>How exactly do these studies work?

264
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:13,550
<9-40,House>你把药给一群人
<9-40,House>Do you give this drug to a bunch of people

265
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,310
<9-40,House>他们没了偏头疼,齐活，你的药就有效了?
<9-40,House>and they don't get a migraine,you go,voila,my drug works?

266
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,830
<9-40,House>请原谅，小姐?
<9-40,House>Excuse me,miss?

267
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,090
<9-40,House>你有癌症吗?
<9-40,House>Do you have cancer?

268
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,790
<9-40,House>芒果汁可致癌
<9-40,House>Mango juice prevents cancer.

269
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:29,380
<9-41,Weber>或许这个讲座前我该吃我的药
<9-41,Weber>Perhaps I should've taken my medication before this lecture.

270
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,830
<9-42,Weber>我们有很精确的试验小组
<9-42,Weber>We had a very specific control group.

271
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,970
<9-42,Weber>慢性偏头疼的受害者
<9-42,Weber>Chronic migraine sufferers.

272
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:37,760
<9-42,Weber>我至今还没看完所有的数据
<9-42,Weber>I don't have time to go through all the math right now,

273
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,710
<9-42,Weber>但影响范围引人注目
<9-42,Weber>but the incidence was dramatically--

274
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,560
<9-43,House>没错，在印度
<9-43,House>sure,in india.

275
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:44,730
<9-43,House>在那2加2等于5，是吧?
<9-43,House>Two plus two equals five there,right?

276
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,050
<9-44,Weber>我认识你吗?
<9-44,Weber>Do I know you?

277
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:50,490
<9-45,House>我知道你的计算技术，很差劲
<9-45,House>I know your math skills.They blow.

278
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,390
<9-46,Wilson>天哪
<9-46,Wilson>Touch?

279
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:54,330
<9-47,Weber>你口音很熟
<9-47,Weber>You sound very familiar.

280
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:57,300
<9-48,House>为什么你要去印度,那样晦暗的杂志发表?
<9-48,House>Why did you publish it in an obscure journal in india?

281
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:58,630
<9-48,House>为什么不在
<9-48,House>Why not publish in

282
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,960
<9-48,House>南费城很酷的地方发表?
<9-48,House>really really cool head cases of south philly?

283
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,730
<9-49,Weber>新德里神经科学是很受推崇的杂志
<9-49,Weber>Neuroscience new delhi is a respected journal.

284
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,180
<9-50,House>连说n都卡壳的家伙说那是最好的杂志
<9-50,House>The guy running slurp 'n' gulp tells me it's one of the best.

285
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:10,210
<9-51,Wilson>找个地缝吧，随便什么
<9-51,Wilson>Get a hooker.Anything.

286
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,240
<9-52,House>你看，我想
<9-52,House>See,I'm thinking that

287
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,910
<9-52,House>发表著作或许是
<9-52,House>publishing studies is probably the easiest way

288
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,890
<9-52,House>引制药公司上钩的最早办法
<9-52,House>to get a pharmaceutical company to give you a reach-around.

289
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:19,180
<9-52,House>而找个没人会读的杂志
<9-52,House>And choosing a journal that no one can actually read,

290
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:21,280
<9-52,House>是很，很精明的
<9-52,House>well,that's,that's shrewd.

291
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:23,330
<9-53,Weber>我知道我认识你
<9-53,Weber>I know I know you.

292
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,590
<9-54,House>当然你认识，呆子
<9-54,House>Sure you do. Dick.

293
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:26,820
<9-55,Weber>我叫菲利普
<9-55,Weber>My name's philip.

294
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,030
<9-56,House>哦，我错了，是你脸的事
<9-56,House>Oh,my bad.Something to do with your face.

295
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:32,040
<9-56,House>我一直觉得你的名字是呆子
<9-56,House>I always think your name is dick.

296
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,300
<9-57,Weber>豪斯?
<9-57,Weber>House?

297
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,740
<9-58,House>是
<9-58,House>Here.

298
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:38,250
<9-59,Weber>医学院是20年前的事
<9-59,Weber>Medical school was 20 years ago.

299
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:40,120
<9-59,Weber>拜托，长大吧
<9-59,Weber>Give it a rest,grow up.

300
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:43,200
<9-60,House>你一直都是成年人，做负责任的事
<9-60,House>You were always the grown-up,do the responsible thing.

301
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:45,660
<9-61,Weber>--告密的,--你欺骗
<9-61,Weber>--Tattletale. --You cheated.

302
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:48,390
<9-62,House>我那时欺骗，而你现在欺骗
<9-62,House>I cheated then,you're cheating now.

303
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,890
<9-62,House>你的药没用
<9-62,House>Your drug doesn't work.

304
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:51,210
<9-63,Weber>对，你当然想那么相信
<9-63,Weber>Yes,you would like to believe that,

305
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:52,860
<9-63,Weber>因为符合你的白日梦
<9-63,Weber>because it plays right into your fantasy--

306
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,080
<9-64,House>我试过
<9-64,House>I tested it.

307
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:58,300
<9-65,Weber>哦，真的？你的参数是什么？,你的专著呢？
<9-65,Weber>Oh,really?What are your parameters? Where's your study?

308
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,790
<9-66,House>2134房
<9-66,House>Room 2134.

309
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:03,920
<9-67,Weber>一个病人?
<9-67,Weber>One patient?

310
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:05,400
<9-68,Wilson>昏迷病患?
<9-68,Wilson>The coma patient?

311
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,350
<9-69,Weber>你一点都没改
<9-69,Weber>You haven't changed a bit.

312
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:13,070
<9-69,Weber>你当年在医学院走捷径,现在你还走捷径
<9-69,Weber>You took short cuts in med school,you're taking short cuts now.

313
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:16,530
<9-69,Weber>你不能在一个非常态的大脑尝试
<9-69,Weber>You cannot test this on an abnormal brain.

314
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:17,920
<9-70,House>真封闭
<9-70,House>That's so closed-minded.

315
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:20,490
<9-70,House>他不是非常态，他很特别
<9-70,House>He's not abnormal,he's special.

316
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:24,500
<9-71,Weber>昏迷的病人大脑皮层萎缩
<9-71,Weber>Cerebral cortex atrophies in coma patients.

317
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:29,070
<9-71,Weber>你需要活的有意识的病人
<9-71,Weber>You need live,conscious people.

318
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,290
<9-71,Weber>你不是万事通，豪斯
<9-71,Weber>You don't know everything,house.

319
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,160
<10-1,Foreman>那是什么东西阻断了大脑的功能
<10-1,Foreman>it's something that disrupts brain function.

320
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:45,150
<10-1,Foreman>插片很好，阻断神经传递
<10-1,Foreman>Plaques are perfect. Interrupt neuronal communication.

321
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:45,950
<10-1,Foreman>M.S.?
<10-1,Foreman>M.S.?

322
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:49,140
<10-3,Foreman>没有M.S.就复杂了,我觉得是基础问题
<10-3,Foreman>No.M.S. Is complicated. I think this is more basic.

323
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,360
<10-3,Foreman>只是心动过速和抽搐
<10-3,Foreman>It's just tachycardia and seizures.

324
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,390
<10-3,Foreman>烧伤科的人还要把他关里头多长时间?
<10-3,Foreman>How much longer the burn unit guys gonna keep him in that thing?

325
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:57,650
<10-4,Cameron>讲座结束了，走吧，豪斯想……
<10-4,Cameron>Lecture's over. Let's go.House wants to...

326
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:02,050
<10-4,Cameron>亚当醒了
<10-4,Cameron>adam's waking up.

327
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,340
<10-5,Foreman>把麻醉科的叫进来
<10-5,Foreman>Get the anesthesiologist in here now.

328
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:06,250
<10-6,Cameron>他疼
<10-6,Cameron>he's in pain.

329
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:09,030
<10-7,Foreman>不是疼
<10-7,Foreman>That's not pain.

330
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,560
<10-7,Foreman>需要帮助这里
<10-7,Foreman>Need some help in here.

331
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:16,250
<11-1,Cameron>亚当来高潮了
<11-1,Cameron>Adam had an orgasm.

332
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:25,040
<11-2,House>什么?你意思是当他……天啊!
<11-2,House>What?You mean while he was--God!

333
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:27,970
<11-3,Cameron>怎么了?
<11-3,Cameron>What's wrong?

334
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:32,090
<11-4,House>我偏头疼
<11-4,House>I'm having a migraine.

335
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:34,080
<11-5,Cameron>你有事吗?
<11-5,Cameron>Are you okay?

336
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:39,910
<11-6,House>我是对的
<11-6,House>Yes. I was right.

337
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:52,340
<12-1,Foreman>我得把你麻倒几个小时
<12-1,Foreman>I'm gonna knock you out for a couple of hours.

338
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:57,200
<12-1,Foreman>不行，我有事要做，给我点止疼的
<12-1,Foreman>No,I got work to do.Just gimme sumatriptan for the pain

339
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,240
<12-2,House>和异博定确保它不复发就行了
<12-2,House>and verapamil so it doesn't recur.

340
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:07,390
<12-2,House>我听说病人在高压氧仓挺乐和？
<12-2,House>I heard the patient had fun in the hyperbaric chamber.

341
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:10,820
<12-4,House>得安排我自己进去试试
<12-4,House>Gotta schedule me some time in there.

342
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,350
<12-5,Foreman>韦伯的药在美国还不合法
<12-5,Foreman>Weber's meds aren't even legal in the U.S.

343
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:21,860
<12-6,House>在印度合法，不明所以
<12-6,House>It's legal in india.I was disoriented.

344
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,170
<12-7,Foreman>来回动不好
<12-7,Foreman>Moving around is a bad idea.

345
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:32,930
<12-7,Foreman>嘿，如果你胸疼，告诉我
<12-7,Foreman>Hey,if you feel chest pain,you need to let me know.

346
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,280
<12-7,Foreman>异搏定可导致心脏充血困难
<12-7,Foreman>Verapamil can cause congestive heart failure.

347
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,350
<12-8,House>无物可伤我心
<12-8,House>Nothing can hurt my heart.

348
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,720
<12-9,Foreman>嘿，你会觉得头晕的
<12-9,Foreman>Hey,you're gonna feel some dizziness.

349
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,860
<12-9,Foreman>肯定会便秘
<12-9,Foreman>Definitely gonna be constipated.

350
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:53,930
<12-10,House>射精的鉴别诊断
<12-10,House>Differential diagnosis for getting off.

351
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:55,860
<12-11,Cameron>他会没事吗?
<12-11,Cameron>Is he gonna be okay?

352
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:58,170
<12-12,Foreman>不会，他很有问题
<12-12,Foreman>No,something's seriously wrong with him.

353
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:03,320
<12-10,House>射精的鉴别诊断
<12-10,House>Differential diagnosis for ejaculation.

354
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,890
<12-13,House>别让我再说了
<12-13,House>Don't make me say it again.

355
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,990
<12-14,Foreman>我们没拖延，只是不知道
<12-14,Foreman>We're not stalling,we just don't know.

356
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,570
<12-15,House>那就猜啊
<12-15,House>Then guess.

357
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,950
<12-16,Cameron>止疼药会导致射精吗?
<12-16,Cameron>Could pain medication cause an orgasm?

358
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:14,240
<12-17,House>我希望
<12-17,House>I wish.

359
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,970
<12-18,Chase>也许是疼痛导致高潮
<12-18,Chase>Maybe pain caused the orgasm.

360
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:19,490
<12-18,Chase>你画纹身，大脑释放安多芬,制造欣快
<12-18,Chase>You get a tattoo,the brain releases endorphins which create pleasure.

361
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,100
<12-19,Cameron>大多数人不会因针刺而高潮
<12-19,Cameron>Most people don't orgasm from a needle prick.

362
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:24,060
<12-20,House>小蔡说的有理
<12-20,House>well,chase has a point.

363
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:28,730
<12-20,House>大脑象个大车站，如果车闸……
<12-20,House>The brain is like a huge train station.If the switches--

364
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:33,200
<12-20,House>你是神经学家，替我说吧
<12-20,House>You're the neurologist,talk for me.

365
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:36,980
<12-21,Foreman>如果感官信息被前脑神经束曲解
<12-21,Foreman>If sensory information got misinterpreted by the medial forebrain bundle,

366
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:40,200
<12-21,Foreman>会导致好感觉是坏，坏感觉是好
<12-21,Foreman>it's possible for bad to feel good and good to feel bad.

367
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:43,750
<12-22,House>他是个走运的小子,我们等他烧伤在治疗他吧
<12-22,House>He's a lucky kid.Let's not fix him until the burns heal.

368
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:46,000
<12-23,Chase>那么是什么攻击了前脑神经束?
<12-23,Chase>So what attacks the medial forebrain bundle?

369
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:48,410
<12-24,Foreman>传染神经炎，脉管神经炎
<12-24,Foreman>Infective neuropathies. Vasculitic neuropathies.

370
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,720
<12-25,Cameron>妄想症，脑蛋白营养不良
<12-25,Cameron>Krabbe's disease,metachromatic leukodystrophy.

371
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:53,320
<12-26,House>都是坏事
<12-26,House>all very bad things.

372
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:55,870
<12-26,House>在他的条件都不会发生
<12-26,House>No way to look for any of them in his condition.

373
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,690
<12-27,Cameron>可能是感染
<12-27,Cameron>Could be an infection.

374
00:21:57,870 --> 00:21:59,340
<12-28,Foreman>我8秒钟前刚说完感染
<12-28,Foreman>I said infection about eight seconds ago.

375
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,360
<12-29,Cameron>你列举的是脑部感染
<12-29,Cameron>You listed some brain infections.

376
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:05,920
<12-29,Cameron>但如果只是普通的,烧伤皮肤溃烂感染呢?
<12-29,Cameron>But what if it's just a regular old infection festering in the burned skin?

377
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:08,590
<12-30,Foreman>用手臂做超声试验,并不会导致前脑问题
<12-30,Foreman>Pus on his arm isn't causing problems in the forebrain.

378
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:12,120
<12-31,Cameron>他用了20种药物控制疼痛和心脏
<12-31,Cameron>He's on 20 different medications to manage his pain,his heart,

379
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,060
<12-31,Cameron>他小便多久一次？
<12-31,Cameron>how often he urinates.

380
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:17,190
<12-31,Cameron>他的大脑象个跑堂的……
<12-31,Cameron>His brain is like a waiter that's got too many--

381
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,140
<12-32,House>我才能做隐喻
<12-32,House>I do the metaphors.

382
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:23,100
<12-33,Cameron>脑部遭重压
<12-33,Cameron>The brain is stressed.

383
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:25,410
<12-33,Cameron>感染会导致他滑出边缘
<12-33,Cameron>An infection elsewhere could put it over the edge.

384
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:28,120
<12-34,Foreman>那我们就等他烧伤好了,再看你是否正确?
<12-34,Foreman>So we just wait for his burns to heal to see if you're right?

385
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,470
<12-34,Foreman>如果你错了，他没有那个时间
<12-34,Foreman>If you're wrong,he doesn't have that kind of time.

386
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:35,320
<12-35,House>多拉力
<12-35,House>Dominic larrey.

387
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:37,620
<12-36,Chase>另一个死医生?
<12-36,Chase>He another dead doctor?

388
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,230
<12-37,House>他是拿破仑的首席医生
<12-37,House>He was napoleon's surgeon in chief.

389
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:42,390
<12-37,House>清理过很多战争外伤
<12-37,House>Cleaned a lot of battle wounds.

390
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:43,890
<12-38,Foreman>切除腿
<12-38,Foreman>By amputating legs.

391
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,700
<12-39,House>有很多虫子
<12-39,House>And with bugs.

392
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,710
<13-1,Cameron>蛆能直接进入亚当的烧伤
<13-1,Cameron>Maggots are implanted directly into adam's burns.

393
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:57,230
<13-2,Doug>蛆吃死人……
<13-2,Doug>Maggots--eat dead people. I--

394
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:01,050
<13-3,Cameron>蛆吃死肉，只吃死肉
<13-3,Cameron>maggots eat dead flesh. Only dead flesh.

395
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:03,790
<13-3,Cameron>所以他们绝对适合清理伤口
<13-3,Cameron>So they're perfectly suited to clean wounds.

396
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:08,490
<13-3,Cameron>它们同时会杀死,在受伤组织里滋生的细菌
<13-3,Cameron>They also kill the bacteria that thrive in injured tissues.

397
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:49,060
<14-1,House>杰力博士，我猜他们发现了,动物园里被吃了一半的羊
<14-1,House>Dr. Jekyll,I presume,they found a half-eaten sheep in the zoo.

398
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:51,150
<14-2,Wilson>警察要问你些问题
<14-2,Wilson>The police want to ask you a few questions.

399
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,890
<14-3,House>我需要些东西把它冲下去
<14-3,House>I need something to wash it down.

400
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:56,670
<14-4,Wilson>咖啡？不好，最好别用水
<14-4,Wilson>Coffee?Bad idea.You're better off with water!

401
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,060
<14-5,House>咖啡很接近
<14-5,House>Coffee's closer.

402
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:02,050
<14-6,Wilson>很简便的计划，顺便一提
<14-6,Wilson>Foolproof plan,by the way.

403
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:05,860
<14-6,Wilson>要不就是他的药有效,而你精神疼痛
<14-6,Wilson>Either his meds would work,and you'd be in psychic pain,

404
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:08,630
<14-6,Wilson>因为魔鬼万会很富有
<14-6,Wilson>because von evil is gonna be rich.

405
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:13,210
<14-6,Wilson>或他们无效，那你一天可要受罪了
<14-6,Wilson>Or they wouldn't,and you get to be in agony all day.

406
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,380
<14-6,Wilson>双输局面，典型的你
<14-6,Wilson>Perfect lose/lose situation. Very you.

407
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,040
<14-7,House>我得证明……
<14-7,House>I had to prove--

408
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:20,630
<14-8,Wilson>你什么也没证明
<14-8,Wilson>you proved nothing.

409
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,920
<14-9,House>对，这不是偏头疼
<14-9,House>Right. This isn't a migraine.

410
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:28,720
<14-10,Wilson>对，亲爱的英国医药杂志
<14-10,Wilson>Yeah,dear new england journal of medicine,

411
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,150
<14-10,Wilson>我吃了这个家伙的药，可还是头疼
<14-10,Wilson>I took this guy's drug,and still got a headache.

412
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:35,030
<14-10,Wilson>因而用科学的方法,证明了你的宿敌是个傻子
<14-10,Wilson>Thus scientifically proving that my arch enemy is an idiot.

413
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:36,680
<14-10,Wilson>你就是想要疼
<14-10,Wilson>You just wanted the pain.

414
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,060
<14-11,House>那个药该可以预防偏头疼
<14-11,House>The meds are supposed to prevent migraine.

415
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,950
<14-12,Wilson>你别疼搞乱了
<14-12,Wilson>You get distracted by pain.

416
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:44,590
<14-12,Wilson>让你该考虑的事情变得没有空间
<14-12,Wilson>Leaves less room for the things you don't wanna think about.

417
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:47,660
<14-12,Wilson>比如航空公司可恶，汽油的价钱
<14-12,Wilson>Like the flyers sucking,or the price of gas,or

418
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:51,380
<14-12,Wilson>面对你把爱推出了你的生命
<14-12,Wilson>the fact that you pushed the love of your life out of your life.

419
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:54,060
<14-13,House>上帝，我真希望疼痛消失
<14-13,House>God,I wish the pain would go away.

420
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:57,390
<14-14,Wilson>下次当你想把她赶走的时候,拿个针头戳进眼睛里吧
<14-14,Wilson>Next time you need to get your mind off her,stick a needle in your eye.

421
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,540
<14-14,Wilson>那时你能走也不会给我们带来不快
<14-14,Wilson>It's less annoying to the rest of us when you can still walk.

422
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,100
<15-1,Cameron>你睡这了么?
<15-1,Cameron>did you sleep here?

423
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:17,140
<15-2,House>低点
<15-2,House>Lower.

424
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:19,460
<15-3,Cameron>你要枕头么?
<15-3,Cameron>Do you want a pillow?

425
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:24,760
<15-4,House>不是轻，是低,你声音的频率刺耳
<15-4,House>Not softer,lower.The frequency of your voice is grating.

426
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,870
<15-5,Foreman>到这会儿，你该好了
<15-5,Foreman>You should've been better by now.

427
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:29,670
<15-6,House>我是超人，病人?
<15-6,House>I'm super. The patient?

428
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:32,450
<15-7,Cameron>蛆把烧伤弄的不错
<15-7,Cameron>Maggots did great for the burn.

429
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:35,420
<15-7,Cameron>但脑波还是到处都是
<15-7,Cameron>But the brainwaves are still all over the map.

430
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:39,650
<15-8,House>也就是说你的普通感染,并没导致他的脑部功能紊乱
<15-8,House>Which means your regular old infection isn't causing his brain dysfunction.

431
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:41,740
<15-8,House>也就是说有潜在条件
<15-8,House>Which means there's an underlying condition.

432
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,100
<15-8,House>所以我们得进入他的头
<15-8,House>Which means we gotta get inside his head.

433
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,300
<15-8,House>做腰椎穿刺
<15-8,House>Do a lumbar puncture.

434
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:48,350
<15-9,Chase>我们已经确定不能做……
<15-9,Chase>We've already established that we can't get a lumbar--

435
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:50,630
<15-10,House>2节，3节
<15-10,House>c2,c3.

436
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:53,100
<15-11,Foreman>不，不行
<15-11,Foreman>No,no,no way.

437
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:56,440
<15-11,Foreman>我只一次看到过一节的,会把那家伙搞瘫痪
<15-11,Foreman>I only saw a cervical tap once,and that guy got paralyzed.

438
00:25:56,590 --> 00:26:01,260
<15-12,House>问父母是想让他儿子坐轮椅,还是死掉
<15-12,House>Ask the parents if they prefer to have their son in a wheelchair,or dead.

439
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:08,080
<16-1,Foreman>某事使他大脑失控
<16-1,Foreman>Something's causing his brain to lose control.

440
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:10,480
<16-1,Foreman>最终会导致关闭
<16-1,Foreman>Eventually it will shut off.

441
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,890
<16-1,Foreman>得做腰椎穿刺
<16-1,Foreman>We need to do a lumbar puncture

442
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:15,250
<16-1,Foreman>获取脊液用来诊断
<16-1,Foreman>to get some of the fluid in his spine so we can test it.

443
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:17,070
<16-2,Emily>你要我们签同意书?
<16-2,Emily>You need us to sign a consent?

444
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:19,130
<16-3,Foreman>我得警告你们
<16-3,Foreman>I have to warn you.

445
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:22,540
<16-3,Foreman>有高风险可导致瘫痪或死亡
<16-3,Foreman>There's a serious risk of paralysis or death.

446
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:25,300
<16-4,Doug>你是说我们不该做么?
<16-4,Doug>Are you saying we shouldn't do this?

447
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,050
<16-5,Foreman>我们需要做
<16-5,Foreman>You have to do this.

448
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,850
<16-6,Emily>那你们干嘛告诉我可能出问题?
<16-6,Emily>Then why are you telling us what can go wrong?

449
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:30,280
<16-7,Foreman>我觉得你该知道
<16-7,Foreman>I just think you should know.

450
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,590
<16-8,Emily>要么就是你们很残忍,要么就是这个签字板
<16-8,Emily>Either you're cruel or this clipboard is a way for you to cover your ass

451
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,920
<16-8,Emily>在万一你们把我儿子搞成瘸子后,给你们退路
<16-8,Emily>in case you cripple our son.

452
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:34,870
<16-9,Doug>这不是他的错……
<16-9,Doug>This isn't his fault--

453
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,960
<16-10,Emily>不，不是，是你的错,这是你一直告诉我的
<16-10,Emily>no,it's not,it's yours. That's what you keep telling me.

454
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:39,480
<16-10,Emily>我儿子躺在里面半死不活
<16-10,Emily>My son is lying in there half dead.

455
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:42,050
<16-10,Emily>我在找条可以熬过去的路
<16-10,Emily>I am just trying to find a way to get through this.

456
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:45,780
<16-12,Emily>－对不起,－是，我知道
<16-12,Emily>I'm sorry. Yeah,I know.

457
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,150
<17-1,Foreman>针
<17-1,Foreman>Needle.

458
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,690
<17-3,Chase>--没进去,--别用蛮力
<17-3,Chase>--It's not going in. --Don't force it.

459
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,960
<17-4,Foreman>我要往上点
<17-4,Foreman>I'm going one space higher.

460
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:28,950
<17-5,Chase>那太靠近脑干了,会出疝气
<17-5,Chase>It's too close to his brain stem,it'll herniate.

461
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:30,700
<17-5,Chase>你会把他搞瘫痪
<17-5,Chase>You're gonna paralyze him.

462
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,060
<17-6,Foreman>没帮助
<17-6,Foreman>Not helping.

463
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,430
<17-7,Chase>他血压飚升，停止
<17-7,Chase>His blood pressure's spiking.Stop.

464
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,110
<17-8,Foreman>我能做到
<17-8,Foreman>I can get it.

465
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:38,330
<17-9,Chase>180/120，会中风
<17-9,Chase>He's 180 over 120. He's gonna stroke.

466
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:41,960
<17-10,Foreman>我进去了，给我小瓶子
<17-10,Foreman>I'm in the space.Gimme the vial.

467
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:02,060
<18-1,Foreman>他没得ms，或感染
<18-1,Foreman>He doesn't have M.S. Or an infection.

468
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:05,970
<18-2,House>他的蛋白质没提高?
<18-2,House>His proteins aren't elevated?

469
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:09,430
<18-3,Foreman>蛋白质错了，Igm,不是igg
<18-3,Foreman>Wrong protein. Igm,not igg.

470
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:12,190
<18-3,Foreman>上升可能由出血导致
<18-3,Foreman>Elevation was probably caused by the bleeding.

471
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:17,410
<18-4,House>如果在他撞车前有麻刺的感觉呢？
<18-4,House>What if there was tingling in his extremities prior to the crash?

472
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,050
<18-5,Foreman>怎么还是M.S.?
<18-5,Foreman>How can you still be on M.S.?

473
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:21,820
<18-6,House>得追症状啊
<18-6,House>You gotta be on something.

474
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:26,240
<18-6,House>有东西妨碍了他的神经活动,比如损伤
<18-6,House>Something's interrupting his neurons' chit-chat. Like lesions.

475
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,150
<18-7,Foreman>我们无法扫描
<18-7,Foreman>We can't scan for them.

476
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:31,250
<18-7,Foreman>唯一能做的试验我们已经做了,而且是阴性的
<18-7,Foreman>Only test we can do we just did,and it was negative.

477
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,190
<18-7,Foreman>他即无麻刺感，也不麻木
<18-7,Foreman>He has no tingling,no numess.

478
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:35,960
<18-7,Foreman>你看了他的病史,父母没说什么
<18-7,Foreman>You read his history.Parents didn't say anything--

479
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:37,850
<18-8,House>那亚当呢?
<18-8,House>what about adam?

480
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:42,290
<18-9,Foreman>我们不能看他的大脑,可你要求我们读他的思维么？
<18-9,Foreman>We can't look into his brain,but you want us to read his mind

481
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,750
<18-10,House>说的好
<18-10,House>Good point.

482
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:57,490
<19-1,House>你们很快可以继续给他洗澡
<19-1,House>You can finish the sponge bath in a minute.

483
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:58,940
<19-2,Anesthesiologist>他们只是在给他敷药
<19-2,Anesthesiologist>They're just redoing his dressings.

484
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,840
<19-2,Anesthesiologist>他没知觉，很好
<19-2,Anesthesiologist>He's out,he's fine.

485
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:02,430
<19-3,House>我不是找你把他弄晕
<19-3,House>I didn't page you to put him out,

486
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,420
<19-3,House>我找你把他弄醒
<19-3,House>I paged you to wake him up.

487
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:06,420
<19-3,House>这些等这么亮干嘛?
<19-3,House>Why are these lights so damn bright?

488
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:08,580
<19-4,House>谢谢
<19-4,House>Thank you.

489
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:10,670
<19-4,House>快点，我要跟他说话
<19-4,House>Come on,I need to talk to him.

490
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:13,510
<19-5,Anesthesiologist>豪斯，你不能唤醒一个烧伤病人,玩20个问题的游戏
<19-5,Anesthesiologist>House,you can't wake up a burn victim to play 20 questions.

491
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,990
<19-5,Anesthesiologist>那是折磨
<19-5,Anesthesiologist>It's torture.

492
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,180
<19-6,House>他不会记得
<19-6,House>He won't remember.

493
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,610
<19-7,Anesthesiologist>他会疼的要死
<19-7,Anesthesiologist>He's gonna be in extraordinary pain--

494
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:20,350
<19-8,House>上帝，你真好，你让我想睡觉
<19-8,House>god,you're good. You're putting me to sleep.

495
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,100
<19-8,House>我知道他会疼
<19-8,House>I know he's gonna be in pain,

496
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:25,430
<19-8,House>我知道你不喜欢，我是他的主治,把他弄醒
<19-8,House>I know you disapprove,I'm his attending,wake him up.

497
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,960
<19-9,Adam>哦，天啊
<19-9,Adam>oh,my god.

498
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,130
<19-10,House>我是豪斯医生
<19-10,House>I'm dr. House.

499
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:49,590
<19-11,Adam>很疼
<19-11,Adam>It hurts!

500
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,540
<19-12,House>会越来越坏，所以快回答
<19-12,House>It's gonna get a lot worse,so answer fast.

501
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,480
<19-12,House>在车祸前……
<19-12,House>Before the accident,

502
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:55,720
<19-12,House>你是否感到麻木和麻刺的感觉?
<19-12,House>did you experience any numbness any tingling in your fingers?

503
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:58,590
<19-12,House>你被烧伤了，正在康复,我需要答案
<19-12,House>You got burnt,it's healing,I need an answer.

504
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:00,220
<19-13,Adam>太疼了
<19-13,Adam>It really hurts!

505
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:02,150
<19-14,House>腿或手是否麻木?
<19-14,House>Any tingling in your arms or legs?

506
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,910
<19-15,Adam>做点什么？我不能……
<19-15,Adam>Do something! I can't--

507
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:07,060
<19-16,House>亚当，你听我说,你感到什么了么?
<19-16,House>adam,you gotta listen to me. Did you feel anything?

508
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:14,060
<19-17,Adam>我尿裤子了，然后……,我不记得了
<19-17,Adam>I pissed my pants and then i don'T...remember--

509
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,710
<20-1,Cameron>他没事么?
<20-1,Cameron>Is he okay?

510
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,160
<20-2,House>把所有人集中到我办公室
<20-2,House>Get everyone in my office.

511
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,210
<20-3,Cameron>你去哪?
<20-3,Cameron>Where are you going?

512
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:02,450
<20-4,House>小子叫唤让我头疼,我得吃个阿司匹林
<20-4,House>Kid's screaming gave me a headache. I gotta take an aspirin.

513
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:04,850
<21-1,Cameron>豪斯，你没事么？,我们在等你
<21-1,Cameron>House.You okay?We've been waiting for you.

514
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,720
<21-2,House>我有幻觉
<21-2,House>I'm hallucinating.

515
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:17,160
<21-3,Cameron>偏头疼有幻觉很罕见
<21-3,Cameron>Hallucinations with migraines are pretty uncommon.

516
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,890
<21-3,Cameron>你看见什么?
<21-3,Cameron>What'd you see?

517
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:22,110
<21-4,House>我看见音乐
<21-4,House>I saw music.

518
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,620
<21-5,Cameron>感官欺诈没有道理
<21-5,Cameron>Sensory deception makes no sense.

519
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,010
<21-6,House>你吃了什么
<21-6,House>You took something.

520
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:35,260
<21-7,Cameron>那孩子在为生命作战
<21-7,Cameron>The kid's fighting for his life.

521
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:06,060
<22-1,Foreman>嘿，你找到他了么?
<22-1,Foreman>hey,you find him?

522
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,850
<22-2,Cameron>他在衣帽间幻觉呢
<22-2,Cameron>He was hallucinating in the locker room.

523
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:09,220
<22-3,Foreman>他没事么?
<22-3,Foreman>He okay?

524
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:11,690
<22-4,Cameron>他不觉得疼，在high
<22-4,Cameron>He's feeling no pain,he's high.

525
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,050
<22-5,Chase>力固定 high?
<22-5,Chase>Vicodin high?

526
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:16,980
<22-6,Cameron>过去那个了，他正在看音乐,吃了什么
<22-6,Cameron>Past that. He's seeing sounds. Took something.

527
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,890
<22-7,House>这里怎么这么黑，外面很美
<22-7,House>why is it so dark in here?Beautiful day outside.

528
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,240
<22-7,House>打开窗帘,让阳光进来
<22-7,House>Open the shades. Let the sunshine in.

529
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:27,290
<22-8,Cameron>现在是夜里
<22-8,Cameron>It's nighttime.

530
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:30,590
<22-9,House>还是周二，是吧?
<22-9,House>It's still tuesday,right?

531
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:31,860
<22-10,Foreman>你看上去不错
<22-10,Foreman>You look better.

532
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:33,830
<22-11,House>我吃了什么
<22-11,House>I took something.

533
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:35,720
<22-12,Foreman>介意我问是什么么?
<22-12,Foreman>Mind if I ask what?

534
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:38,030
<22-13,House>这一点，那一点
<22-13,House>little of this,little of that.

535
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:42,010
<22-13,House>我知道病人怎么了,他抑郁
<22-13,House>I know what's wrong with our patient.He's depressed.

536
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,550
<22-14,Cameron>你叫醒他时他告诉你的么?
<22-14,Cameron>He told you that when you woke him up?

537
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:46,200
<22-15,House>不，他说他尿裤子后,就昏过去了
<22-15,House>No,he told me he pissed his pants and blacked out.

538
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,790
<22-16,Foreman>那不是抑郁的诊断
<22-16,Foreman>That's not a diagnostic of depression.

539
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,310
<22-16,Foreman>胃口萎缩，孤立自己
<22-16,Foreman>Lack of appetite. Isolating yourself--

540
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:52,530
<22-17,House>不能控制排尿，昏迷是什么的症状？
<22-17,House>uncontrollable urination and blackingut are good predictors of what?

541
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,550
<22-18,Cameron>抽搐
<22-18,Cameron>Seizure.

542
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:55,060
<22-19,House>那就证明他所患的抽搐
<22-19,House>Which means the seizure he had when you

543
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,350
<22-19,House>包括你测试他心脏的时候,那是第二次
<22-19,House>tested his heart was at least his second seizure.

544
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:00,190
<22-20,Foreman>那又怎样？,抑郁和抽搐没有关联
<22-20,Foreman>So what? Depression and seizures aren't correlated.

545
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:02,230
<22-21,House>你知道什么有关联?
<22-21,House>No,but you know what is?

546
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:05,330
<22-21,House>抑郁和抗抑郁药
<22-21,House>Depression and anti-depression medicine.

547
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,120
<22-22,Chase>氧化屏显正常
<22-22,Chase>Tox screen was clean.

548
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:10,190
<22-23,House>可你知道他用了多少药对抗烧伤么？
<22-23,House>But you know how much crap he's got in his system for dealing with those ,burns

549
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:13,190
<22-23,House>那家伙能让整个西班牙舰队,在他的血流里倾覆
<22-23,House>The guy could have the spanish armada floating through his bloodstream,

550
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:16,280
<22-23,House>我们不会知道，直到他们开始开炮
<22-23,House>we wouldn't know about it,'til they started firing cannons.

551
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:19,760
<22-24,Foreman>抗抑郁药已知可导致少儿抽搐,但不是高潮
<22-24,Foreman>Antidepressants have been known to cause seizures in kids,but not orgasms.

552
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:21,320
<22-24,Foreman>这是有毛病的大脑
<22-24,Foreman>This is a brain in trouble.

553
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:24,150
<22-25,House>这个是血液有复合胺的大脑
<22-25,House>This is a brain with too much serotonin.

554
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:26,190
<22-26,Cameron>复合胺影响情绪和胃口
<22-26,Cameron>Serotonin affects mood,appetite.

555
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:28,120
<22-26,Cameron>不会导致大脑关闭
<22-26,Cameron>It doesn't cause a brain to shut down.

556
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,140
<22-27,House>抗抑郁药会让大脑觉得
<22-27,House>Antidepressants fake brains into thinking

557
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:32,000
<22-27,House>他们有比实际多的复合胺
<22-27,House>they have more serotonin than they actually do.

558
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:36,140
<22-27,House>每千万病例会发生连锁反应
<22-27,House>Every 10 million or so cases,it sets off a chain reaction.

559
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:39,210
<22-27,House>能产生足够麻烦
<22-27,House>It produces too much,enough to fry itself.

560
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,750
<22-28,Foreman>如果亚当有复合胺就死定了
<22-28,Foreman>If adam has serotonin storm,it's deadly.

561
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,950
<22-29,Chase>但可以治疗，二苯环哽锭
<22-29,Chase>But treatable.Cyproheptadine.

562
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:45,730
<22-30,Cameron>除非他真有复合胺
<22-30,Cameron>Unless he doesn't have serotonin storm.

563
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,970
<22-30,Cameron>比起复合胺，他会更容易有多巴胺
<22-30,Cameron>He could just as easily have too much dopamine as serotonin.

564
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,550
<22-30,Cameron>可如果是多巴胺,二苯环哽锭会杀死他
<22-30,Cameron>But if it's dopamine,the cyproheptadine will kill him.

565
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:52,820
<22-31,Chase>你去哪?
<22-31,Chase>Where are you going?

566
00:34:52,970 --> 00:34:55,090
<22-32,House>我要再跟那孩子谈谈，看上去不错
<22-32,House>I'm gonna talk to the kid again.Seems nice.

567
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:56,720
<22-33,Cameron>你不能
<22-33,Cameron>You can'T.

568
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,160
<22-34,House>为什么？,他说不喜欢我了么？
<22-34,House>Why? Did he say he doesn't like me?

569
00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:00,790
<22-35,Cameron>麻醉师告诉父母你干什么了
<22-35,Cameron>The anesthesiologist told the parents what you did.

570
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,450
<22-36,House>每个人都是告密者
<22-36,House>Everyone's a tattletale.

571
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,540
<22-37,House>你儿子抑郁么?
<22-37,House>Is your son depressed?

572
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:14,420
<22-38,Emily>不，你是谁?
<22-38,Emily>No,who are you?

573
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:15,860
<22-39,House>我是豪斯医生
<22-39,House>I'm dr. House.

574
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:16,960
<22-40,Emily>哦，你就是那个白痴……
<22-40,Emily>Oh,you're the idiot who--

575
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:18,930
<22-41,Doug>我在走廊都听见了他的叫声
<22-41,Doug>I heard him screaming all the way down the hallway.

576
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:21,790
<22-42,House>如果我不叫醒他,就无法知道什么导致撞车
<22-42,House>If I didn't wake him up,I wouldn't have learned what caused the crash.

577
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:24,100
<22-42,House>我想他抽筋了
<22-42,House>I think he had a seizure.

578
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:28,570
<22-43,Doug>这不是我的错?
<22-43,Doug>Th-this wasn't my fault?

579
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,950
<22-44,House>如果他没有脑部问题,他就不会被烧了
<22-44,House>Well,if he hadn't had the brain problem,he wouldn't have the burns.

580
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:35,310
<22-44,House>换个说法,如果你没让他坐卡丁车
<22-44,House>On the other hand,if you hadn't put him on the atv,

581
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:36,450
<22-44,House>他也不会被烧
<22-44,House>he also wouldn't have the burns.

582
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:38,350
<22-44,House>你可以等我走了再争辩你的责任
<22-44,House>You can debate your personal responsibility after I leave.

583
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:40,290
<22-44,House>我得把他再次唤醒
<22-44,House>I need to wake him up again.

584
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:42,020
<22-44,House>我需要知道他是否服用抗抑郁药
<22-44,House>I need to know if he's taking anti-depressants.

585
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,350
<22-45,Emily>他没有
<22-45,Emily>He's not.

586
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,960
<22-46,Doug>他是我知道的最快乐的孩子
<22-46,Doug>He's the happiest kid I know.

587
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,650
<22-47,House>但你不知道，是吧?
<22-47,House>But you don't know,do you?

588
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:51,110
<22-48,Doug>他是我儿子
<22-48,Doug>He's my son.

589
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,950
<22-49,House>嗯，那也是我的意思
<22-49,House>Mmm,that's sort of my point.

590
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:57,580
<22-49,House>到了16岁，他们会告诉任何人,任何事，可不是父母
<22-49,House>At 16,they'll tell anyone anything.Except their parents.

591
00:35:57,770 --> 00:35:59,280
<22-50,Emily>亚当跟我们无话不谈
<22-50,Emily>Adam talks to us about everything.

592
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,100
<22-51,House>对，我知道大麻和可卡因的事
<22-51,House>Yeah,I know about the pot and the cocaine.

593
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,890
<22-52,Emily>根本没有可卡因
<22-52,Emily>There was never cocaine--

594
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:04,630
<22-53,House>你肯定?
<22-53,House>you sure?

595
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:06,150
<22-53,House>你跟踪他么?
<22-53,House>You having him followed?

596
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:08,540
<22-54,Emily>他告诉我们在舞会喝醉的事
<22-54,Emily>He told us when he got drunk at a party.

597
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,620
<22-54,Emily>他告诉我们性交的时间
<22-54,Emily>He told us when he started having sex.

598
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:12,970
<22-55,House>16岁，东西多呢
<22-55,House>16,way to go.

599
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:14,600
<22-56,Emily>他告诉我们数学考试作弊的事
<22-56,Emily>He tolus when he cheated on a math test.

600
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:16,250
<22-56,Emily>他告诉我们女友欺骗他的事
<22-56,Emily>He told us when his girlfriend cheated on him.

601
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:18,460
<22-56,Emily>他跟我们从不隐瞒
<22-56,Emily>He doesn't hide anything from us.

602
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:19,940
<22-57,House>但如果他抑郁?
<22-57,House>But if he was depressed?

603
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,270
<22-58,Emily>他会告诉我们
<22-58,Emily>He'd tell us.

604
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:24,400
<22-58,Emily>我们不评论，他不抑郁,我们肯定
<22-58,Emily>We don't judge. He's not depressed,we're sure.

605
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:26,610
<22-59,House>"以他的生命打赌" 肯定?
<22-59,House>"Bet his life on it" sure?

606
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,150
<22-59,House>假设
<22-59,House>Just hypothetically.

607
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,620
<22-61,House>好
<22-61,House>Okay.

608
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:44,740
<23-1,House>孩子很快乐、快乐
<23-1,House>Kid's happy.Happy,happy,happy.

609
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:47,820
<23-2,Cameron>那我们就回到开始，抽搐失调
<23-2,Cameron>Then we're back to where we started,seizure disorders.

610
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:51,340
<23-3,House>抽搐失调不会导致高潮
<23-3,House>Seizure disorders aren't causing orgasms.

611
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:52,990
<23-4,Chase>脉管畸形
<23-4,Chase>Vascular malformations.

612
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:55,130
<23-5,House>语图上会看到
<23-5,House>Would've seen it on the sonogram.

613
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:57,060
<23-6,Foreman>肝脑病?
<23-6,Foreman>Hepatic encephalopathy?

614
00:36:57,210 --> 00:36:59,910
<23-7,House>肝酶测试正常
<23-7,House>Liver enzyme tests were normal.

615
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:06,860
<23-7,House>你去哪?
<23-7,House>Where are you going?

616
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:08,710
<23-7,House>撒尿
<23-7,House>Take a leak.

617
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:17,540
<24-1,Doug>你干嘛?
<24-1,Doug>What are you doing?

618
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:19,510
<24-2,House>不能进来，你们没消毒
<24-2,House>Can't come in here.You're not sterile.

619
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:20,950
<24-3,Emily>别碰我们的儿子，我们告诉你了
<24-3,Emily>Don't touch our son,we told you.

620
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:23,420
<24-4,House>认真的,你身上有成千上万的细菌病毒
<24-4,House>Seriously,millions of bacteria,microbes on you.

621
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:24,970
<24-4,House>他会死于脓血症
<24-4,House>He'll die of sepsis.

622
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,190
<24-5,Emily>如果你进去...
<24-5,Emily>If you go in there...

623
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:32,120
<24-6,Doug>我看他会再次把他唤醒
<24-6,Doug>I think he's gonna wake him up again.

624
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:33,660
<24-7,Foreman>我知道他会
<24-7,Foreman>I know he is.

625
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,170
<24-7,Foreman>豪斯，你不能那么做
<24-7,Foreman>House,you can't do this.

626
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:40,340
<24-8,House>如果每次我听见都有硬币的话
<24-8,House>Oh,if I had a nickel for every time I've heard that.

627
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,990
<24-8,House>放松，他们会诉我们么?
<24-8,House>Relax. They gonna sue us?

628
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:45,240
<24-8,House>如果我对了，我会挽救他的性命
<24-8,House>If I'm right,I save his life.

629
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:48,250
<24-8,House>如果我错了，他无论如何都会死
<24-8,House>If I'm wrong,he's dead no matter what I do.

630
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,080
<24-8,House>任何一条路,我到底对他们有多大伤害?
<24-8,House>Either way,how much have I really hurt them?

631
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:53,030
<24-9,Emily>别碰他
<24-9,Emily>leave him alone!

632
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,350
<24-10,House>你没消毒，你想杀他么?
<24-10,House>You're not sterile. You wanna kill the kid?

633
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:56,560
<24-11,Foreman>给我注射器
<24-11,Foreman>Give me the syringe.

634
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,620
<24-12,House>没有疼痛，就没有收获
<24-12,House>No pain,no gain.

635
00:37:57,810 --> 00:37:59,550
<24-13,Foreman>嘿，你给我停止
<24-13,Foreman>Hey,you gotta stop this.

636
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:07,330
<24-14,House>你是对的，他不是抑郁
<24-14,House>You're right. He's not depressed.

637
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:08,840
<24-15,Foreman>对，是啊
<24-15,Foreman>Yeah,sure.

638
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,420
<24-15,Foreman>我不会让你走除非你给我注射器
<24-15,Foreman>I'm not letting you go until you give me that syringe.

639
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:13,290
<24-16,House>他手腕上是什么?
<24-16,House>What's that on his wrist?

640
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:15,760
<24-17,Foreman>烧伤
<24-17,Foreman>a burn.

641
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:16,920
<24-18,House>为什么是手腕?
<24-18,House>Why on his wrist?

642
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:18,170
<24-19,Foreman>为什么不是手腕?
<24-19,Foreman>Why not on his wrist?

643
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:20,670
<24-20,House>他的后辈，一切都乱套了
<24-20,House>His back,his torso,everything's a mess.

644
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:23,400
<24-20,House>他的前臂是干净的，除了这里
<24-20,House>His forearms are clean. Except right there.

645
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,500
<24-21,Foreman>那又怎么了?
<24-21,Foreman>so what?

646
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:27,310
<24-22,House>是个完整的圆环
<24-22,House>It's a perfect circle.

647
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:31,240
<24-23,Foreman>汽油掉下来，atv的螺丝
<24-23,Foreman>So a drop of burning gasoline fell on his wrist. A screw from the atv.

648
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:34,050
<24-24,House>或许
<24-24,House>Maybe.

649
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,900
<25-1,Emily>你干嘛折磨他?
<25-1,Emily>Why are you torturing him?

650
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:47,120
<25-2,House>你儿子抽烟么?
<25-2,House>Does your son smoke?

651
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:49,290
<25-3,Doug>我会杀了他
<25-3,Doug>I'd kill him.

652
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:55,150
<25-4,House>那么说他跟你谈性、吸毒,任何事但不说吸烟
<25-4,House>So he talked to you about sex,crack.Anything except cigarettes.

653
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:59,340
<25-4,House>他的手腕上有香烟烫伤
<25-4,House>He has a cigarette burn on his wrist.

654
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:03,420
<25-4,House>也有尼古丁痕迹在两个手指上
<25-4,House>And also a fading nicotine stain between two fingers.

655
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:06,790
<25-4,House>坏消息，你儿子有个肮脏不洁的习惯
<25-4,House>Bad news,you son has a filthy,unhealthy habit.

656
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:11,690
<25-4,House>好消息，他正要戒,坏消息，戒烟要了他的命
<25-4,House>Good news,he's trying to quit.Bad news,the quitting's killing him.

657
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:17,760
<25-4,House>好消息，我可以治好他,坏消息……没了，结束
<25-4,House>Good news,I can cure him. Bad news... nope,that's the end of it.

658
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,340
<25-5,Emily>戒烟会杀人?
<25-5,Emily>Quitting smoking can kill?

659
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,770
<25-5,Emily>戒烟药是抗镇静剂
<25-5,Emily>No-smoke meds are anti-depressants.

660
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,050
<25-6,House>从网络上来的破烂玩意
<25-6,House>The crappy ones you get over the internet.

661
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:27,620
<25-6,House>他们装上任何便宜的抗镇静剂
<25-6,House>They're loaded with whatever anti-depressants they can get cheap.

662
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:31,900
<25-6,House>父母肯定不带他去看儿科医生...
<25-6,House>Since mommy and daddy obviously didn't take him to a pediatrician...

663
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:37,560
<25-6,House>抱歉我说他抑郁错了
<25-6,House>sorry,I was wrong about him being depressed.

664
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:39,950
<25-6,House>治疗他吧
<25-6,House>Treat him.

665
00:39:57,430 --> 00:40:01,970
<26-1,Cuddy>嘿，你滴酸了么?
<26-1,Cuddy>hey.Did you drop acid?

666
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:05,120
<26-2,House>我干嘛要那样?
<26-2,House>Why would I do that?

667
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:08,980
<26-3,Cuddy>滋扰我，或你很悲惨
<26-3,Cuddy>To annoy me.Or maybe because you're miserable.

668
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:13,520
<26-3,Cuddy>或者你要自毁，自己选吧
<26-3,Cuddy>Or because you wanna self-destruct. Pick one.

669
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:18,440
<26-4,House>如果是酸最早被大脑吸收
<26-4,House>How 'bout because lsd acts on serotonin receptors in the brain,

670
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,990
<26-4,House>可以治偏头疼如何？
<26-4,House>which can stop a migraine in its tracks.

671
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:24,150
<26-4,House>我说这也是可能性
<26-4,House>I'm just saying it's also a possibility.

672
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:25,190
<26-4,House>你怎么知道……
<26-4,House>How did you know--

673
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:27,070
<26-5,Cuddy>卡麦伦担心你
<26-5,Cuddy>cameron is worried about you.

674
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:30,140
<26-5,Cuddy>我告诉她第一次要等上12个小时
<26-5,Cuddy>I told her that lsd lasts up to 12 hours.

675
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:31,920
<26-5,Cuddy>如果你还能运行，那她一定错了
<26-5,Cuddy>If you were functional,she must be wrong.

676
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,840
<26-6,House>不那样，我也会吃一大堆抗镇静药
<26-6,House>Either that,or I also took a whole bunch of anti-depressants,

677
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:36,620
<26-6,House>然后可以替代
<26-6,House>which short-circuited the lsd.

678
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:38,910
<26-6,House>我是说那样也是个解释
<26-6,House>I'm just saying that would also explain it.

679
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,770
<26-7,Weber>谢谢你毁了我的临床试验
<26-7,Weber>Thank you for ruining my clinical trials.

680
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:43,460
<26-7,Weber>制药公司关闭了试验
<26-7,Weber>Pharmaceutical company's shutting me down.

681
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:44,520
<26-8,House>你开玩笑，真的?
