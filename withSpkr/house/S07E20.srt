141
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,890
<3-9,Cyrus >重点是什么都没变
<3-9,Cyrus >The point is nothing's changed.

142
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:29,140
<3-9,Cyrus >我依然过着同样的生活  吃着同样的食物
<3-9,Cyrus >I live the same life. I eat the same food.

143
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,810
<3-10,Phil >一样劣质的罐装食品
<3-10,Phil >Same crappy canned food.

144

<3-11,Taub >你一天有几餐是吃罐头
<3-11,Taub >How many of your meals do you eat from a can?

145
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:35,970
<3-12,Cyrus >大多数都是
<3-12,Cyrus >Most of 'em.

146
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,340
<3-12,Cyrus >我已经习惯了
<3-12,Cyrus >I'm used to it.

00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,320
<3-12,Cyrus >我在网上订购
<3-12,Cyrus >I order 'em by the case online.

148
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:41,770
<3-12,Cyrus >有什么问题吗
<3-12,Cyrus >Is that bad?

149
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,760
<4-1,Chase >你在担心卡迪母女和豪斯的
<4-1,Chase >You're worried about the trickle down effect

150
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,850
<4-1,Chase >三人火拼会殃及到病人
<4-1,Chase >of Cuddy versus House versus Cuddy.

151
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,010
<4-2,Foreman >你是在解读我的内心世界吗
<4-2,Foreman >You're reading subtext into my silence?

152
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,000
<4-3,Chase >豪斯比其他人更懂得怎么刺激你
<4-3,Chase >House gets to you more than anyone.

153
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,280
<4-4,Foreman >豪斯认为我是个机器人
<4-4,Foreman >House thinks I'm a robot.

154
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,530
<4-4,Foreman >你觉得我很没用吗
<4-4,Foreman >You think I'm a wuss?

155
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,060
<4-5,Chase >不  不是
<4-5,Chase >No, no, no, no.

156
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,880
<4-5,Chase >我觉得你是太压抑了
<4-5,Chase >I think you're repressed.

157
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,990
<4-5,Chase >当然  这也不能怪你
<4-5,Chase >Well, it's out of your control.

158
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,500
<4-5,Chase >艰难的童年
<4-5,Chase >Tough childhood,

159

<4-5,Chase >在白人的世界里难以成功
<4-5,Chase >Can't be easy trying to succeed in a white man's world.

161
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,520
<4-6,Foreman >首先  别拿人种说事
<4-6,Foreman >First of all, white man,

162
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,140
<4-6,Foreman >我的工作能力至少跟你相当
<4-6,Foreman >I've done at least as well as you have.

163
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:21,640
<4-6,Foreman >第二  我觉得你并不认同豪斯所认为的
<4-6,Foreman >Second, I didn't think you take House's view

164
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,050
<4-6,Foreman >生活糟糕而我们身陷其中不得解脱
<4-6,Foreman >that life sucks and we're stuck.

165
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,530
<4-7,Chase >我觉得你确实陷进去了
<4-7,Chase >I think you're stuck.

166
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,970
<4-7,Chase >大概是上个月  我的生活变了样
<4-7,Chase >Last month or so I've turned my life around.

167
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:29,540
<4-7,Chase >我比以前开心多了

<4-8,Foreman >Sleeping with ten women instead of four?

169
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:32,780
<4-9,Chase >一个都没有
<4-9,Chase >Try none.

170
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:35,100
<4-9,Chase >他在切割金属  是因为吸入粉尘吗
<4-9,Chase >He was cutting metal... Inhaled the dust?

171
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,300
<4-10,Foreman >除非他像吸毒那样吸入粉尘
<4-10,Foreman >Unless he was snorting lines of the stuff.

172
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:39,490
<4-9,Chase >一个都没有吗
<4-9,Chase >None?

173
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:42,470
<4-11,Chase >长期的做爱
<4-11,Chase >Was having tons of sex,

174
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:44,650
<4-11,Chase >让我觉得很无聊  自己都痛恨自己
<4-11,Chase >and I was bored, hating myself.

175
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:47,820
<4-11,Chase >当真爱来临时  我却没有做好准备
<4-11,Chase >Was never gonna be ready when something real came along.

176
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:50,370
<4-12,Foreman >你能变成一个超级修道士
<4-12,Foreman >So you're becoming some kind of super monk,

177
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:52,040
<4-12,Foreman >我却只能是老样子
<4-12,Foreman >and I can't change at all.

178
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:55,790
<4-13,Chase >我赌如果豪斯或其他人让你不爽
<4-13,Chase >I challenge you to go one differential

179
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:58,490
<4-13,Chase >你内心都会压着这股气
<4-13,Chase >without House or anyone else getting under your skin.

180
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,310
<4-14,Foreman >不过我说了没什么能够影响我
<4-14,Foreman >Since I say nothing gets to me

181
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,540
<4-14,Foreman >而你又不相信我的话
<4-14,Foreman >and you won't take me at my word,

182
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:02,870
<4-14,Foreman >我要怎么证明你是错的呢
<4-14,Foreman >how am I supposed to prove you wrong?

183
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:04,040
<4-15,Chase >我想你大概没法证明
<4-15,Chase >I guess you can't.

184
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:06,400
<4-15,Chase >希望你不会因此而纠结不已
<4-15,Chase >I hope that doesn't eat at you.

185
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:10,720
<4-16,Chase >未注册商标的溶剂  中国产的
<4-16,Chase >Off-brand solvent. From China.

186

<4-16,Chase >鬼才知道成分是什么
<4-16,Chase >Made of God knows what.

<5-1,Taub >又是一例患者食用廉价罐头食品的案例
<5-1,Taub >Patient eats cheap canned goods by the caseload.

188
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,000
<5-1,Taub >会是金属中毒吗
<5-1,Taub >Could be metal poisoning?

189
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:18,790
<5-2,Chase >他还和廉价的化学药品打交道
<5-2,Chase >He also worked with cut-rate chemicals.

190
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:21,340
<5-2,Chase >可能是吸入挥发性有毒物质
<5-2,Chase >Could be inhalation of a toxic volatile substrate.

191
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,240
<5-3,Thirteen >螯合疗法能治疗这两种可能
<5-3,Thirteen >Treatment for both is chelation.

192
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:24,460
<5-4,House >干得好
<5-4,House >Great work.

193
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:27,420
<5-4,House >碱化他的尿液并利尿
<5-4,House >Alkalinize his urine and force diuresis

194
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:29,580
<5-4,House >以治疗重金属中毒
<5-4,House >for heavy metal poisoning.

195
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:32,910
<5-4,House >如果不管用  再做透析来治疗有毒物质
<5-4,House >If that doesn't work, put him on dialysis for toxic inhalation.

196
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:35,670
<5-5,Thirteen >我刚说了  螯合剂可以兼治两者
<5-5,Thirteen >I just said treatment for both is chelation.

197
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:38,880
<5-6,House >我说先利尿  再做个透析
<5-6,House >And I said force diuresis and try dialysis.

198
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:39,880
<5-6,House >你没有听清吗
<5-6,House >You need a transcript?

199
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,360
<5-7,Foreman >在螯合剂就能治疗的情况下
<5-7,Foreman >You want to put him on dialysis,

200
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,480
<5-7,Foreman >你要他冒着感染
<5-7,Foreman >risk infection and hemodynamic swings

201
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,400
<5-7,Foreman >和血流动力学改变的风险做透析吗
<5-7,Foreman >when we can just chelate?

202
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,430
<5-8,Chase >大家冷静点
<5-8,Chase >Settle down.

203
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,340
<5-9,House >如果我们用螯合剂
<5-9,House >If we chelate,

204
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:51,040
<5-9,House >我们就不知道他得了什么病
<5-9,House >we're not gonna know what disease he had,

205
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,590
<5-9,House >我们就不会知道问题是出在
<5-9,House >which means we're not gonna know if the problem

206
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,200
<5-9,House >以前糟糕的职业上
<5-9,House >was in his lousy old job

207
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,910
<5-9,House >还是如今依旧很糟糕的生活上
<5-9,House >or his still-lousy new life.

208
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,330
<5-9,House >为了解决我们刚才的争论
<5-9,House >Which for the purposes of a metaphorical argument

209
00:07:58,330 --> 00:07:59,630
<5-9,House >答案很重要
<5-9,House >is very important.

210
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:03,470
<5-9,House >没什么好反对的
<5-9,House >Pointless to argue.

211
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:05,070
<5-9,House >他是老板  老板说了要玩解迷游戏
<5-9,House >He's the boss. He needs his puzzle solved.

212
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,560
<5-9,House >我们干嘛要违逆他呢
<5-9,House >Why bang our heads against the wall?

213
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,530
<5-9,House >病人那边处理好以后
<5-9,House >When you're done with the patient,

214
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,960
<5-9,House >治治福曼吧  拿他的头多撞几下墙
<5-9,House >treat Foreman by banging his head against the wall.

215
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,480
<6-1,Taub >透析仪呢
<6-1,Taub >Where's the dialysis machine?

216
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,400
<6-2,Thirteen >管它呢  我预约了做螯合治疗
<6-2,Thirteen >Who cares? Since I ordered chelation.

217
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:20,720
<6-2,Thirteen >我们抛硬币来决定告诉豪斯哪个是病因
<6-2,Thirteen >We'll flip a coin, tell House it was one disease or the other.

218
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,970
<6-2,Thirteen >最不济反抗暴露了  他则对我们刮目相看
<6-2,Thirteen >Worst case, he finds out and he's impressed we defied him.

219
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,740
<6-2,Thirteen >不好意思  我是叫你撤掉透析仪
<6-2,Thirteen >I'm sorry. I asked you to remove the dialysis equipment,

220
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:28,070
<6-2,Thirteen >没叫你撤掉螯合仪器
<6-2,Thirteen >not the chelation equipment.

221
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,290
<6-3,Nurse >卡迪医生叫我撤掉所有仪器
<6-3,Nurse >And Dr. Cuddy asked me to remove all equipment.

222
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:32,180
<6-3,Nurse >她通知要中止所有治疗
<6-3,Nurse >She de-authorized all treatment.

223
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,370
<7-1,Thirteen >她不让我们做任何治疗
<7-1,Thirteen >She won't let us make a move

224
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:38,520
<7-1,Thirteen >除非你同意坐下来
<7-1,Thirteen >until you agree to a sit-down

225
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,660
<7-1,Thirteen >和教母大人以及她的律师谈谈
<7-1,Thirteen >with the godmother and her consigliere.

226
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,400
<7-2,House >她够狠的
<7-2,House >Bitch to king four.

227
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:43,690
<7-3,Taub >没招了
<7-3,Taub >Checkmate.

228
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,480
<7-3,Taub >病人的腿动不了
<7-3,Taub >Patient can't use his leg.

229
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:46,610
<7-3,Taub >你这次必须妥协
<7-3,Taub >You have to concede.

230
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:53,000
<7-4,House >或者我还可以选择撒手不管
<7-4,House >Or I could just knock all the pieces onto the floor.

231
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,700
<8-1,Cyrus >你们要我出院吗
<8-1,Cyrus >You're discharging me?

232
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:56,780
<8-2,Taub >我们实在是
<8-2,Taub >We really...

233
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:00,040
<8-2,Taub >编不出什么好的谎话来...
<8-2,Taub >don't have a good lie here, so...

234
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,050
<8-3,Thirteen >我们的头头和他的上司发生摩擦
<8-3,Thirteen >You got caught in some politics

235
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:02,930
<8-3,Thirteen >你不幸做了炮灰
<8-3,Thirteen >between our boss and his boss,

236
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:04,650
<8-3,Thirteen >但最多让你出院二十分钟
<8-3,Thirteen >but you'll be out of here 20 minutes tops.

237
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,160
<8-4,Cyrus >我的病还没治好  你们就想撵我走吗
<8-4,Cyrus >I'm not better, but you're kicking me out?

238
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,430
<8-5,Thirteen >所以我说你出院不会超过二十分钟
<8-5,Thirteen >Which is why it'll only be 20 minutes.

239
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,500
<8-5,Thirteen >院长这次很强硬  但她强硬不到哪里
<8-5,Thirteen >See, the Dean of Medicine acts tough, but she's not really.

240
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:10,780
<8-5,Thirteen >不久她就会干预  然后重新收你入院
<8-5,Thirteen >She'll step in, readmit you.

241
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,500
<8-6,Phil >你是说比起那位不作为的医生
<8-6,Phil >So you're saying that she cares more about his treatment

242
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:14,470
<8-6,Phil >反而是她更在意病人的治疗状况吗
<8-6,Phil >than the doctor who's actually treating him.

243
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,800
<8-6,Phil >菲尔  闭嘴
<8-6,Phil >Phil, shut up.

244
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,560
<8-7,Jennifer >塞勒斯
<8-7,Jennifer >Cyrus.

245
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,370
<8-8,Cyrus >詹妮弗
<8-8,Cyrus >Jennifer.

246
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,940
<8-9,Jennifer >能见到你真好
<8-9,Jennifer >It's good to see you.

247
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,330
<8-9,Jennifer >我在报纸上读到了有关你的报道
<8-9,Jennifer >I read about you in the paper,

248
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:31,630
<8-9,Jennifer >便跳上了第一列从弗吉尼亚开来的火车
<8-9,Jennifer >so I hopped the first train from Virginia.

249
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,260
<8-10,Phil >就是说你看到他一夜暴富的消息  是吧
<8-10,Phil >So you read that he struck it rich?

250
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:37,640
<8-11,Jennifer >他说的对
<8-11,Jennifer >He's right.

251
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:39,610
<8-11,Jennifer >我突然过来  看起来肯定很古怪
<8-11,Jennifer >It--it must look weird.

252
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:41,370
<8-11,Jennifer >确实有点古怪
<8-11,Jennifer >It kind of is weird.

253
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,650
<8-11,Jennifer >距我们去第三大道堤坝玩耍已经好久了
<8-11,Jennifer >Well, we're a long way from the third street jetty.

254
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:48,130
<8-11,Jennifer >我就是想来再看看你  问声好
<8-11,Jennifer >I just wanted to see you again and say hi,

255
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:50,170
<8-11,Jennifer >你好
<8-11,Jennifer >So. Hi.

256
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,030
<8-12,Cyrus >我几乎要以为再也找不到我的...
<8-12,Cyrus >I was starting to think I'd never find my...

257
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:00,670
<8-13,Jennifer >熊宝宝
<8-13,Jennifer >Baby bear.

258
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,560
<8-14,Cyrus >天哪  对不起
<8-14,Cyrus >Oh, my God. I'm--I'm so sorry.

259
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:15,710
<8-14,Cyrus >实在是不好意思
<8-14,Cyrus >I'm so sorry.

260
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,890
<8-14,Cyrus >我一点儿都没觉得恶心
<8-14,Cyrus >I--I don't even feel nauseous.

261
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,290
<8-15,Thirteen >-我不知道怎么就...  -你手在抖
<8-15,Thirteen >- I don't know why... - Your hand is shaking. Okay.

262
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,370
<8-15,Thirteen >是局灶性癫痫发作
<8-15,Thirteen >You're having a focal seizure.

263
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:23,600
<8-16,Phil >这是什么情况
<8-16,Phil >What does that mean?

264
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:25,630
<8-17,Taub >就是说你不用出院了
<8-17,Taub >It means you're not getting discharged.

265
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,710
<9-1,Taub >是大脑的问题  我们猜对了
<9-1,Taub >We were right that it's a brain issue,

266
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,910
<9-1,Taub >但却不是因为金属中毒或者吸入有毒粉尘
<9-1,Taub >but wrong about toxic inhalation and metal poisoning.

267
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,520
<9-1,Taub >其他人都在等着呢
<9-1,Taub >Everyone else is waiting--

268
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,620
<9-2,House >克洛伊[模特]真是够勇敢
<9-2,House >That was totally courageous of Khloe

269
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:36,040
<9-2,House >居然在微博上讲自己胖了
<9-2,House >to Tweet about her weight gain.

270
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:39,530
<9-3,Taub >豪斯  病人无法走路并伴有癫痫
<9-3,Taub >House, I've got a patient with a seizure disorder who can't walk.

271
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:40,170
<9-4,House >又来了一个这样的吗
<9-4,House >Another one?

272
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:41,770
<9-4,House >还以为我们刚赶走了最后一个呢
<9-4,House >Thought we kicked out the last one.

273
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,980
<9-5,Cuddy >显然  我会同意让你治疗那个病人
<9-5,Cuddy >Obviously I'll let you treat your patient.

274
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,390
<9-4,House >你做什么呢
<9-4,House >What are you doing?

275
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:50,030
<9-4,House >咱们的病人无法癫痫并伴有步行症
<9-4,House >We got a patient with a walking disorder who can't seize.

277
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:54,120
<9-4,House >等等  不对  但我说的很接近了是吧
<9-4,House >No, wait. I'm close, though, right?

278
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,420
<9-5,Cuddy >我没说完呢
<9-5,Cuddy >I wasn't finished.

279
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:57,220
<9-5,Cuddy >显然我会同意你治疗他
<9-5,Cuddy >Of course I'll let you treat your patient

280
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,650
<9-5,Cuddy >前提是你我各退一步
<9-5,Cuddy >if you meet me halfway.

281
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,920
<9-5,Cuddy >那看来我也没休息够呢
<9-5,Cuddy >Well, I guess I'm not finished either.

282
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:03,420
<9-6,Cuddy >下个季度你不用出诊了
<9-6,Cuddy >No clinic hours for the next quarter.

283
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,030
<9-7,House >再给我三个紧挨着的停车位
<9-7,House >Yeah, three parking spots,

284
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:06,980
<9-7,House >让我能够斜着停车
<9-7,House >next to each other, so I can park diagonally,

285
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,020
<9-7,House >我还要你三套内衣
<9-7,House >and three pairs of your underwear.

286
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,570
<9-7,House >我在考虑航海呢
<9-7,House >I'm thinking of taking up sailing.

287
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,160
<9-8,Cuddy >算了
<9-8,Cuddy >Forget it.

288
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,350
<9-8,Cuddy >病人你爱治不治
<9-8,Cuddy >Treat your patient, don't treat your patient.

289
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,990
<9-8,Cuddy >会面你爱来不来
<9-8,Cuddy >Come to the meeting, don't come to the meeting.

290
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:21,260
<9-8,Cuddy >我不再陪你玩游戏了
<9-8,Cuddy >I'm done playing your game.

291
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:23,690
<9-9,House >输家认输后游戏就自动结束了
<9-9,House >You realize the game is automatically over

292
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:24,630
<9-9,House >你是知道的对吧
<9-9,House >when the loser loses, right?

293
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,070
<10-1,Foreman >神经莱姆病
<10-1,Foreman >Neurological Lyme disease

294
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:31,650
<10-1,Foreman >可以解释癫痫和瘫痪症状
<10-1,Foreman >explains the seizures and the paralysis.

295
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,080
<10-2,House >但无法解释为什么奇斯在测量你的指标
<10-2,House >But not the fact that Chase seems to be treating you.

296
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:36,930
<10-3,Foreman >他自称可以永远不再做爱
<10-3,Foreman >He claims he can swear off sex indefinitely.

297
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:40,980
<10-3,Foreman >还声称我是个压抑满腹怒火的滚水锅
<10-3,Foreman >Also claims that I am a boiling cauldron of repressed rage.

298
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:48,540
<10-3,Foreman >你的理论蠢透了
<10-3,Foreman >Your theory is idiotic.

299
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:52,120
<10-4,Foreman >病人的莱姆病抗体滴度呈阴性
<10-4,Foreman >The patient's antibody titers were negative for Lyme disease.

300
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:57,720
<10-4,Foreman >我和你前女友曾在一间旅店里同房共寝
<10-4,Foreman >And I shared a motel room with your ex-girlfriend.

301
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:03,460
<10-4,Foreman >关于抗体滴度的问题  你说的很对
<10-4,Foreman >You make a good point about the antibody titers.

302
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,960
<10-5,House >他还真是块石头
<10-5,House >He's a rock.

303
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,750
<10-5,House >你弟弟怎样了  那个无家可归的家伙
<10-5,House >How's your brother-- homeless guy?

304
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,640
<10-5,House >好久没他的消息了吧
<10-5,House >Haven't heard from him in months!

305
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,230
<10-6,Foreman >我不知道  希望我有他消息
<10-6,Foreman >I don't know. Wish I did.

306
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,400
<10-6,Foreman >体位性低血压
<10-6,Foreman >Postural hypotension,

307
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:14,930
<10-7,House >这会导致大脑的血供减少
<10-7,House >which could have reduced the blood supply to his brain.

308
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:16,630
<10-7,House >那他可真是个倒霉蛋
<10-7,House >He'd be a miserable wretch.

309
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,010
<10-8,Taub >实际上  预后的...
<10-8,Taub >Actually, the prognosis is--

310
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:18,800
<10-8,Taub >抱歉
<10-8,Taub >Oh, I'm sorry.

311
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:21,360
<10-9,House >我只是想说他的人生前景一片黑暗
<10-9,House >No, I just meant his life is gonna unravel.

312
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:23,950
<10-9,House >客观来讲  任何诊断结果都是一样的
<10-9,House >In fairness, that applies to any diagnosis.

313
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:26,520
<10-9,House >我们干嘛讨论这个
<10-9,House >Why do we do this?

314
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:29,190
<10-10,Thirteen >不是体位性低血压  他当时没在站着
<10-10,Thirteen >It's not postural hypotension. He's not orthostatic.

315
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:30,920
<10-11,Taub >他的生活可能会崩塌  也可能不会
<10-11,Taub >His life may unravel, it may not.

316
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,980
<10-11,Taub >他并不追求物质享受
<10-11,Taub >He's not chasing after material things.

317
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,870
<10-12,House >真糟  他本能好好享受的
<10-12,House >Too bad. He might actually get those.

318
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,990
<10-13,Taub >他寻找的是爱情
<10-13,Taub >He's looking for love.

319
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,680
<10-13,Taub >找寻旧日女友
<10-13,Taub >Just tracked down an old girlfriend.

320
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,300
<10-14,Thirteen >而最终找到的人却和记忆里相差甚远
<10-14,Thirteen >And she'll never live up to the memory,

321
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:41,480
<10-14,Thirteen >找到她的激动感也会烟消云散
<10-14,Thirteen >and the thrill of finding her will wear off,

322
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:43,650
<10-14,Thirteen >他以后连憧憬幸福的可能都没有了
<10-14,Thirteen >and he won't even be able to dream about being happy.

323
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:46,160
<10-15,House >有意思
<10-15,House >Interesting.

324
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,020
<10-16,Thirteen >他或许找到了许久以前的女伴
<10-16,Thirteen >The patient may have found some long-ago nookie,

325
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:50,770
<10-16,Thirteen >但这并不表示在这期间他一直守身如玉
<10-16,Thirteen >but it doesn't mean he hasn't had some in the meantime.

326
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:52,150
<10-16,Thirteen >疱疹病毒性脑炎
<10-16,Thirteen >Herpes encephalitis.

327
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,980
<10-17,House >可以解释神经系统症状
<10-17,House >Explains the neurological symptoms.

328
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:56,450
<10-17,House >做脑电图确诊
<10-17,House >EEG to confirm,

329
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,450
<10-17,House >然后静脉滴注阿昔洛韦治疗
<10-17,House >I.V. Acyclovir to treat.

330
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,350
<10-17,House >福曼的血压怎么样了
<10-17,House >How's Foreman's BP holding?

331
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,110
<10-18,Chase >还那样
<10-18,Chase >Same.

332
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,120
<10-19,House >那就怪了
<10-19,House >That's strange,

333
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,880
<10-19,House >因为我半分钟前刚拔掉了导线
<10-19,House >since I unplugged the lead 30 seconds ago.

334
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:13,430
<10-19,House >多了不起的忍耐力
<10-19,House >Admirable effort.

335
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:15,710
<10-19,House >我这么说可不是因为我担心你发火
<10-19,House >And I'm not just saying that 'cause I'm scared you might turn green

336
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,050
<10-20,House >或者扯烂你自己的衣服
<10-20,House >and rip through your own clothes.

337
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:24,170
<10-20,House >对病人的浪漫情怀不屑一顾
<10-20,House >Down on the patient's romance

338
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:28,190
<10-20,House >是因为你的寿命已短到撑不过一次约会了吗
<10-20,House >because your own lifespan is shorter than dinner and a movie?

339
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,570
<10-21,Thirteen >不幸的人注定不幸  这可是你说的
<10-21,Thirteen >You're the one who said miserable stays miserable.

340
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:34,060
<10-22,House >而你把它挂在嘴边  一天重复好几遍
<10-22,House >You keep saying it. Several times a day.

341
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:35,860
<10-23,Thirteen >回来工作太让我开心了
<10-23,Thirteen >I love being back,

342
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,830
<10-23,Thirteen >每个你我都认同的观点
<10-23,Thirteen >having every theory you and I share

343
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,190
<10-23,Thirteen >都被你用来证明我的人生残缺不堪
<10-23,Thirteen >used as proof of my own personal damage.

344
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,750
<11-1,Thirteen >恐怕一会开始脑电图检查后
<11-1,Thirteen >I'm afraid we'll need you to step out

345
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,780
<11-1,Thirteen >你得去外面等待
<11-1,Thirteen >when the EEG begins.

346
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:52,610
<11-1,Thirteen >等候区就在下面大厅里
<11-1,Thirteen >The waiting area's just down the hall.

347
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,540
<11-2,Jennifer >没关系  反正我要坐早班车走的
<11-2,Jennifer >I got to catch an early train in the morning anyway.

348
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:55,440
<11-3,Cyrus >别  别走
<11-3,Cyrus >No, don't.

349
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,820
<11-3,Cyrus >我可以给你安顿一家好点的酒店
<11-3,Cyrus >I'll put you up in a nice hotel,

350
00:13:58,820 --> 00:13:59,500
<11-3,Cyrus >或者给你租一间带家具的房子
<11-3,Cyrus >or rent you a furnished place.

351
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,640
<11-4,Jennifer >我连夜赶来  只是想看看你生活得如何
<11-4,Jennifer >I came for the night 'cause I wanted to see how you were.

352
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:05,280
<11-4,Jennifer >也许有想重新成为你生活的一部分
<11-4,Jennifer >Maybe get back in your life a bit,

353
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:06,480
<11-4,Jennifer >但如果我接受你的钱...
<11-4,Jennifer >but if I take your money...

354
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:08,230
<11-4,Jennifer >给你找个好地方住有什么问题
<11-4,Jennifer >What's wrong with a nice place to stay?

355
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:12,050
<11-4,Jennifer >当然了  除非是
<11-4,Jennifer >Unless of course...

356
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,570
<11-5,Jennifer >你不想留下来
<11-5,Jennifer >You don't want to stay.

357
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,570
<11-5,Jennifer >或许我的旅馆房间还可以再续一两天
<11-5,Jennifer >I guess I could keep my motel room another night or two.

358
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,920
<12-1,House >帮我会会诊
<12-1,House >Need a consult.

359
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:32,250
<12-1,House >给病人做了脑电图
<12-1,House >Did an EEG on my patient.

360
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:34,380
<12-1,House >结果表明  前几个医生
<12-1,House >Turns out the reason that prior doctors

361
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,870
<12-1,House >之所以认为那不是神经系统疾病
<12-1,House >thought it wasn't a neuro problem

362
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,020
<12-1,House >是因为确实不是神经系统疾病
<12-1,House >is because it's not a neuro problem.

363
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:41,810
<12-1,House >但脑电图确实显示有代谢障碍的迹象
<12-1,House >The EEG did show signs of metabolic distress.

364
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:42,730
<12-2,Wilson >那就扫描他的腹部
<12-2,Wilson >Well, scan his abdomen.

365
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,720
<12-2,Wilson >是啊  不妨假设我们已经完成这一步了
<12-2,Wilson >Yeah, let's assume we'd already figured that out on our own,

366
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:48,030
<12-3,House >并且在胰腺发现一个肿块
<12-3,House >and found a mass on the pancreas.

367
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:54,730
<12-4,Wilson >肿块看上去是实性的  要我说就是癌症
<12-4,Wilson >Mass looks solid. I'd say it's cancer.

368
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:57,580
<12-4,Wilson >副瘤综合征可以解释神经系统症状
<12-4,Wilson >Paraneoplastic syndrome would explain the neurological symptoms.

369
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:58,550
<12-4,Wilson >得取出一小块检查检查
<12-4,Wilson >You need to get a piece of it.

370
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,270
<12-4,Wilson >预约做个CT引导下活检吧
<12-4,Wilson >Schedule a CT-guided biopsy.

371
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:03,390
<12-5,House >是啊  不妨假设我们这一步也完成了
<12-5,House >Yeah, let's assume we'd already figured that out on our own.

372
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,570
<12-6,Wilson >那你还来找我会诊干什么
<12-6,Wilson >Then what's this consult?

373
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:12,630
<12-7,House >卡迪母女俩的事  你怎么都没冲我嚷嚷
<12-7,House >Why haven't you been yelling at me about the Cuddy twins?

374
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,560
<12-8,Wilson >因为你做得没错
<12-8,Wilson >Because you're doing the right thing.

375
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,000
<12-9,House >我们是在说同一件事吗
<12-9,House >Are we talking about the same issue?

376
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,470
<12-9,House >还是我做了什么
<12-9,House >Is there something I don't know about

377
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:22,550
<12-9,House >自己都没意识到的正确举动吗
<12-9,House >that I'm responding to appropriately?

378
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,630
<12-10,Wilson >卡迪希望你能介入这件事
<12-10,Wilson >Cuddy wants you in the middle of this.

379
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:25,440
<12-10,Wilson >艾琳也这么想
<12-10,Wilson >So does Arlene.

380
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:27,390
<12-10,Wilson >因为她们不愿正视自己的问题
<12-10,Wilson >Because they don't want to face their own problem.

381
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:30,740
<12-10,Wilson >而你那些出于本能的幼稚行为
<12-10,Wilson >Somehow, in your knee-jerk, juvenile way,

382
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:34,090
<12-10,Wilson >却歪打正着  是成熟的应对方式
<12-10,Wilson >you tripped and fell into an actual adult response to this.

383
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:37,370
<12-10,Wilson >你说的对
<12-10,Wilson >You're right.

384
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:45,260
<12-10,Wilson >这自始至终都是卡迪的计策
<12-10,Wilson >That was Cuddy's strategy all along.

385
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,510
<12-10,Wilson >她想让我以为
<12-10,Wilson >She wanted me to think

386
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,570
<12-10,Wilson >如果我不去  她就完蛋了
<12-10,Wilson >that she desperately needed me to be there

387
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,740
<12-10,Wilson >于是我就肯定不会去了
<12-10,Wilson >so that I wouldn't be there.

388
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:01,030
<13-1,Lawyer >豪斯医生在哪里
<13-1,Lawyer >Where is Dr. House?

389
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,860
<13-2,Cuddy >我不想让他来
<13-2,Cuddy >I didn't want him here.

390
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,900
<13-2,Cuddy >这与她在普林斯顿医院接受的治疗无关
<13-2,Cuddy >This isn't about her treatment at Princeton-Plainsboro.

391
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,730
<13-2,Cuddy >只是因为我们上周大吵了一架
<13-2,Cuddy >It's about the fight we had last week.

392
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:11,020
<13-2,Cuddy >我想和我妈单独呆会
<13-2,Cuddy >I'd like a moment with my mother

393
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:13,870
<13-2,Cuddy >看看我俩能否自己解决这问题
<13-2,Cuddy >to try and work this out on our own.

394
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,560
<13-3,Lawyer >恐怕我的委托人不希望
<13-3,Lawyer >I'm afraid my client doesn't want to--

395
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:17,090
<13-4,Cuddy >这个周日就是母亲节了
<13-4,Cuddy >It's mother's day Sunday.

396
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:19,940
<13-4,Cuddy >我们就不能单独聊五分钟来化解矛盾吗
<13-4,Cuddy >We can't have five minutes alone to fix this?

397
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:21,420
<13-5,Arlene >放松  你站在外面这段时间
<13-5,Arlene >Relax. You can still bill me

398
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,380
<13-5,Arlene >我也会付你钱的
<13-5,Arlene >for the time standing in the hallway.

399
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,780
<13-6,Cuddy >我知道你很生气
<13-6,Cuddy >I know you're mad at me,

400
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,890
<13-6,Cuddy >但你自己上下楼都很困难
<13-6,Cuddy >but you can barely make it up those stairs.

401
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,950
<13-6,Cuddy >你有多少晚上都是睡在沙发上的
<13-6,Cuddy >How many nights have you spent on your couch?

402
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,870
<13-7,Arlene >这和我们之间的争吵无关
<13-7,Arlene >This has nothing to do with our fight.

403
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:39,180
<13-8,Cuddy >我们说的是我家  不是战俘集中营
<13-8,Cuddy >We're talking about my home, not a prison camp.

404
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,050
<13-9,Arlene >我刚才说过了
<13-9,Arlene >What did I just say?

405
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:42,060
<13-9,Arlene >我认为这事不要夹杂私人恩怨
<13-9,Arlene >I think it was something about this not being personal.

406
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,240
<13-10,Cuddy >你可以有时间和瑞秋在一起
<13-10,Cuddy >You can spend time with Rachel.

407
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,690
<13-10,Cuddy >我可以照顾你
<13-10,Cuddy >I can watch over you.

408
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,390
<13-10,Cuddy >双赢
<13-10,Cuddy >Win, win.

409
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:47,270
<13-11,Arlene >也许我身体是不太好
<13-11,Arlene >Maybe I've got a medical thing.

410
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,930
<13-11,Arlene >也许我只是自顾自说
<13-11,Arlene >Maybe I just think I'm talking,

411
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:50,520
<13-11,Arlene >而没人愿认真听我说
<13-11,Arlene >but no one can hear me,

412
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:52,200
<13-11,Arlene >不只是我那漠不关心的女儿
<13-11,Arlene >not just my uncaring daughter.

413
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:54,660
<13-12,Cuddy >你想怎样
<13-12,Cuddy >What do you want?

414
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:55,440
<13-13,Arlene >两万
<13-13,Arlene >20 grand.

415
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,650
<13-13,Arlene >我会雇人照看并忘记你带给我的这些破事
<13-13,Arlene >I'll hire help and forget this nightmare you put me thr--

416
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:01,610
<13-13,Arlene >三万好了  我会安个电梯的
<13-13,Arlene >make it 30. I'll put in a stair lift.

417
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,620
<13-14,Cuddy >不要说是和解  就是你提出的这些条件
<13-14,Cuddy >If my board even hears about these threats,

418
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,040
<13-14,Cuddy >如果被董事会听到了
<13-14,Cuddy >let alone a settlement,

419
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,190
<13-14,Cuddy >他们会调查你在医院期间
<13-14,Cuddy >they'll investigate what happened

420
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:09,510
<13-14,Cuddy >发生了什么
<13-14,Cuddy >while you were here as a patient.

421
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:12,270
<13-14,Cuddy >我和豪斯都会丢了行医执照的
<13-14,Cuddy >House and I could both lose our licenses.

422
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:16,440
<13-14,Cuddy >我本以为这是私人恩怨
<13-14,Cuddy >I've been assuming this is personal

423
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:18,070
<13-14,Cuddy >因为我不愿相信
<13-14,Cuddy >because I don't want to assume

424
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,690
<13-14,Cuddy >那才是我母亲想要的结果
<13-14,Cuddy >that was what my mother wants.

425
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:27,420
<13-15,Arlene >豪斯
<13-15,Arlene >House.

426
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:29,130
<13-16,House >前非岳母
<13-16,House >Ex-not-mom-in-law.

427
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:29,980
<13-17,Cuddy >你说过你不会来的
<13-17,Cuddy >You said you weren't coming.

428
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:32,230
<13-18,House >在你对我说了那么多甜言蜜语以后吗
<13-18,House >After you said pretty please with sugar on top?

429
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,630
<13-18,House >问题是我们这只换货不退款
<13-18,House >Problem is we only give store credit,

430
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:38,920
<13-18,House >按我说不如把那个破烂有毒髋部放回去
<13-18,House >so I say we put your old, cracked poisonous hip back in.

431
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:39,840
<13-18,House >就在此时此地
<13-18,House >Here and now.

432
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:41,180
<13-18,House >我救了你的命
<13-18,House >I saved your life.

433
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,760
<13-18,House >你不喜欢的话可以还给我
<13-18,House >Happy to un-save it.

434
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,130
<13-19,Cuddy >他最近很混蛋
<13-19,Cuddy >He is being an ass.

435
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,250
<13-19,Cuddy >我也想和你一起起诉他...
<13-19,Cuddy >If I could join you in suing him--

436
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,620
<13-20,House >我们上床时她也喜欢我这么做
<13-20,House >She's like this in bed too.

437
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:50,110
<13-20,House >想方设法把律师赶走  再趁人之危
<13-20,House >Always scheming to get the lawyers out of the room.

438
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:56,050
<13-20,House >如果豪斯不想认真对待此事
<13-20,House >If House isn't going to take this seriously,

439
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:58,160
<13-21,House >我知道有些法官会的
<13-21,House >I know a few judges who will.

440
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,730
<13-21,House >我刚才该唱白脸吗
<13-21,House >Was I supposed to be the good cop?

441
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:08,940
<14-1,Foreman >我也是不得已才作假的
<14-1,Foreman >I had to rig the monitor.

442
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,770
<14-1,Foreman >我早饭时吃了很多盐
<14-1,Foreman >I had a lot of salt with breakfast.

444
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,170
<14-1,Foreman >你也觉得我抑郁了
<14-1,Foreman >You think I'm repressed too?

445
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:19,030
<14-2,Taub >我觉得你快被
<14-2,Taub >I think you're in danger of being dissolved

446
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,400
<14-2,Taub >肚子里的酸水给溶了
<14-2,Taub >by your own stomach acids.

447
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:21,630
<14-3,Foreman >那奇斯呢
<14-3,Foreman >Well, what about Chase?

448
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:24,100
<14-3,Foreman >你相信他独善其身的那套废话吗
<14-3,Foreman >Believe all that nonsense about him being celibate?

449
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:26,200
<14-4,Taub >我不知道  不过我支持他
<14-4,Taub >Don't know, but I'm rooting for him.

450
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:27,280
<14-4,Taub >我看过一些研究说
<14-4,Taub >Read the studies.

451
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:29,310
<14-4,Taub >你的床上朋友越少
<14-4,Taub >The fewer partners you have,

452
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,590
<14-4,Taub >你和终身伴侣就越幸福快乐
<14-4,Taub >the happier you are with your ultimate partner.

453
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:35,400
<14-5,Foreman >没错  那你可就悲剧了
<14-5,Foreman >Then you're gonna be miserable.

454
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,820
<14-4,Taub >那些研究
<14-4,Taub >The studies,

455
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:39,940
<14-6,Taub >重要的是要有对照组
<14-6,Taub >it's important that they have a control group.

456

<14-6,Taub >他的胰腺处有个肿瘤
<14-6,Taub >There's the tumor on his pancreas.

457
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,840
<14-7,Foreman >肾脏和结肠处也各有一个
<14-7,Foreman >There's one on his kidney and one in his colon.

458
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:51,700
<14-8,Taub >一个像非血管源性肿瘤
<14-8,Taub >One looks avascular,

459
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,390
<14-8,Taub >一个像血管源性肿瘤
<14-8,Taub >one looks vascular.

460
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:55,050
<14-8,Taub >第三个像钙化性占位
<14-8,Taub >The third looks calcifie

<14-9,Foreman >他同时患有三种不同类型的癌症
<14-9,Foreman >he has three completely different cancers at once.

462
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:01,190
<14-10,Taub >总体来说  他可不怎么走运
<14-10,Taub >On average, not so lucky after all.

463
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,830
<15-1,Wilson >你拿我当灰太郎耍阿
<15-1,Wilson >You had to go all Wile E. Coyote on me.

464
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:08,580
<15-2,House >是你告诉我艾琳想让我参与其中的
<15-2,House >You told me that Arlene wanted me in the middle of it.

465
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:10,700
<15-2,House >我已经让她明白这样不会有好结果的
<15-2,House >I had to show her that no good would come of that.

466
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:13,400
<15-3,Wilson >不是吧  你就不能理性地处理这事吗
<15-3,Wilson >Seriously? That's your rationalization?

467
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:17,080
<15-3,Wilson >这理由怎么样  你不喜欢卡迪耍了你
<15-3,Wilson >How about you didn't like that Cuddy tricked you?

468
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,030
<15-3,Wilson >即使你俩的最终目的相同
<15-3,Wilson >Even though you wanted the same thing as her.

469
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:21,750
<15-3,Wilson >你不喜欢她赢你
<15-3,Wilson >You didn't like that she got the best of you.

470
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:24,200
<15-3,Wilson >你对她的愤怒远超过你的想像
<15-3,Wilson >You've got more anger toward her than you realize.

471
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:25,640
<15-4,House >没了她我过得更快活
<15-4,House >I'm happier without her.

472
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,530
<15-4,House >我才不会愚蠢地认为她能让我变得幸福
<15-4,House >I'm not stupidly expecting her to make me happy.

473
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:34,360
<15-4,House >我更满意自己现在不幸福的状态
<15-4,House >I'm happier with my unhappiness.

474
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:37,130
<15-5,Wilson >你知道你刚才在说什么吗
<15-5,Wilson >Do you listen to what you're saying?

475
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,000
<15-5,Wilson >可我一直都有听你胡言乱语
<15-5,Wilson >Because I have to.

476
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:40,530
<15-5,Wilson >我要开次峰会  你和卡迪都得来
<15-5,Wilson >I'm holding a summit meeting to force you and Cuddy

477
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:43,300
<15-5,Wilson >在我们收到一纸诉状前  统一战线
<15-5,Wilson >onto the same page before a lawsuit gets filed.

<15-7,Thirteen >Multi-cancer syndrome-- Von Hippel Lindau?

480
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,680
<15-8,Chase >那不会影响到他的结肠
<15-8,Chase >Wouldn't have touched his colon.

481
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:00,280
<15-8,Chase >我在此证明
<15-8,Chase >I hereby certify that

<15-8,Chase >Dr. Foreman has not tampered with

483
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,310
<15-8,Chase >动任何手脚
<15-8,Chase >this blood pressure mechanism in any way.

484
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:07,100
<15-9,Foreman >在我证明我根本就没有压抑自己后
<15-9,Foreman >And after I prove I'm 100% stress free,

485
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:09,440
<15-9,Foreman >我能给你系条贞操带吗
<15-9,Foreman >do I get to strap you into a chastity belt?

486
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:12,470
<15-10,Thirteen >如果是患者缺失了一个抑癌基因呢
<15-10,Thirteen >What if the patient's missing a tumor-suppressor gene?

487
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,500
<15-11,Foreman >那要怎么查出来
<15-11,Foreman >How would we even find it?

488
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,090
<15-11,Foreman >咱们现在就得给他化疗了
<15-11,Foreman >We need to blast him with chemo now.

489
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,210
<15-12,Chase >我们不能给病人化疗
<15-12,Chase >We can't give the patient chemo.

490
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,570
<15-12,Chase >他的血小板计数已经跌至谷底了
<15-12,Chase >His platelet count's through the floor.

491
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:21,840
<15-13,House >更糟的是  那会遏制他的癌症
<15-13,House >Even worse, it'd contain his cancers.

492
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,110
<15-13,House >如果想知道这些癌症有什么共同点
<15-13,House >If we want to know what they have in common,

493
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,570
<15-13,House >就得看看癌症接下来会扩散到哪里
<15-13,House >we got to see where they spread next.

494
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:26,900
<15-14,Thirteen >你想再等六个月  放任他的癌症扩散
<15-14,Thirteen >You want to wait six months while the cancer spreads

495
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:28,740
<15-14,Thirteen >而让癫痫和瘫痪恶化吗
<15-14,Thirteen >and his seizures and paralysis get worse?

496
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,350
<15-15,House >这是有点疯狂
<15-15,House >Well, now, that's crazy talk.

497
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:31,840
<15-15,House >不过如果我们给病人
<15-15,House >But if we pump the patient

498
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,710
<15-15,House >输入大量血管内皮生长因子
<15-15,House >full of vascular endothelial growth factor...

499
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,000
<15-16,Chase >福曼不喜欢这主意
<15-16,Chase >Foreman doesn't like that idea.

500
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:48,380
<15-16,Chase >你想引发更多更大的肿瘤吗
<15-16,Chase >You want to grow more and bigger cancers?

501
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:50,650
<15-17,House >我们没办法弄清楚那三个小肿瘤的共同点
<15-17,House >We can't figure out what three small ones have in common,

502
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,570
<15-17,House >也许再有八个大肿瘤我们就能明白了
<15-17,House >maybe can figure out what eight big ones have in common?

503
00:20:57,050 --> 00:20:58,070
<15-16,Chase >你是真的这么打算
<15-16,Chase >Is this idea real,

504
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:01,080
<15-16,Chase >还是只是想通过威胁杀死病人来刺激我
<15-16,Chase >or are you just threatening to kill the patient to screw with me?

505
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:08,260
<15-17,House >这整件事太白痴了
<15-17,House >This whole thing is idiotic.

506
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,160
<15-17,House >只要我知道如何控制情绪
<15-17,House >What does it matter what's inside of me

507
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,290
<15-18,Thirteen >压抑不压抑又有什么关系呢
<15-18,Thirteen >if I know how to control it?

508
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:12,650
<15-18,Thirteen >对我们没所谓
<15-18,Thirteen >Makes no difference to us,

509
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,240
<15-18,Thirteen >不过你也许想立个遗嘱
<15-18,Thirteen >but you may want to make out a will.

510
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,590
<15-19,House >去让那个彩票病人签字
<15-19,House >Go get lotto boy's consent,

511
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:19,690
<15-19,House >然后让他的肿瘤长到十一个
<15-19,House >and turn his cancers up to 11.

512
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,010
<15-20,Thirteen >怎么  你找到我的旧年鉴
<15-20,Thirteen >You, what, found my old yearbook,

513
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:33,310
<15-20,Thirteen >发现了我高中男友的照片吗
<15-20,Thirteen >and got a picture of my high school boyfriend?

514
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,970
<15-20,Thirteen >实际上  没那么复杂
<15-20,Thirteen >Actually, that would have been a lot simpler.

515
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,710
<15-21,House >我十分钟之前刚拍的
<15-21,House >I took this ten minutes ago.

516
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:43,120
<15-21,House >你的高中男友甩了你
<15-21,House >Your high school boyfriend who dumped you,

517
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,750
<15-21,House >让你不再相信
<15-21,House >leaving you unable to believe

518
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:47,100
<15-21,House >旧情复燃这种事
<15-21,House >that anyone can rekindle an old flame.

519
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:50,450
<15-22,Thirteen >他是在我和他妹搞到一起后才甩的我
<15-22,Thirteen >He dumped me after I hooked up with his sister.

520
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:58,390
<15-23,House >你能委婉地拒绝他吗
<15-23,House >Would you mind letting him down gently?

521
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:00,760
<15-23,House >我貌似说了些你无法信守的大话
<15-23,House >I might have made promises you can't keep.

522
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,730
<16-1,Taub >我们要让你得更多的癌症
<16-1,Taub >We're giving you more cancer.

523
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,740
<16-1,Taub >这事的风险不言而喻
<16-1,Taub >The risks of that are kind of obvious.

524
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:13,240
<16-2,Thirteen >我们会频繁地扫描并检测你的血液
<16-2,Thirteen >We'll scan you, run your blood at frequent intervals.

525
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,700
<16-2,Thirteen >我们坚信这是找出
<16-2,Thirteen >We believe this is our best chance

526
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,650
<16-2,Thirteen >你潜在的遗传缺陷的最佳办法
<16-2,Thirteen >at finding the underlying genetic flaw.

527
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:28,020
<16-3,Cyrus >你愿意嫁给我吗
<16-3,Cyrus >Will you marry me?

528
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:34,930
<16-4,Jennifer >别傻了
<16-4,Jennifer >Don't be stupid.

529
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:36,760
<16-5,Cyrus >如果我被癌症打败
<16-5,Cyrus >If this cancer overwhelms me,

530
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:38,680
<16-5,Cyrus >我至少可以幸福的死去
<16-5,Cyrus >at least I'll die happy here and now,

531
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,800
<16-5,Cyrus >而不是在对无望的未来的憧憬中离开
<16-5,Cyrus >instead of hoping for a future I may never have.

532
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,960
<16-5,Cyrus >我爱你
<16-5,Cyrus >I love you.

533
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:48,040
<16-6,Jennifer >不  并非如此
<16-6,Jennifer >No, you don't.

534
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,640
<16-6,Jennifer >你不知道也不可能知道你是否爱我
<16-6,Jennifer >You don't know. You can't know.

535
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,450
<16-6,Jennifer >我们彼此都需要更多的时间
<16-6,Jennifer >We both need more time.

536
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,390
<16-6,Jennifer >我相信我们会有未来的
<16-6,Jennifer >And I believe we're gonna have it.

537
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:08,920
<17-1,Thirteen >你注意到她每天都穿不同的衣服吗
<17-1,Thirteen >Do you notice she's wearing different clothes every day?

538
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:11,860
<17-2,Taub >与一成不变的病号服相对比吗
<17-2,Taub >As opposed to the same, starfleet-issued tunic?

539
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:12,820
<17-3,Thirteen >她说她只计划留一个晚上
<17-3,Thirteen >She said she came for one night.

540
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,050
<17-3,Thirteen >为什么带了那么多衣服
<17-3,Thirteen >Why'd she pack for more?

541
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:16,070
<17-4,Taub >她在包里多放了件毛线衫
<17-4,Taub >So she stuffed an extra sweatshirt in her bag,

542
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:16,980
<17-4,Taub >或者她新买了衣服
<17-4,Taub >or she bought something.

543
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:19,460
<17-5,Thirteen >买二手的吗  她来就是为了这个爆发户
<17-5,Thirteen >Used? She's here because an old beau struck gold.

544
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:20,880
<17-6,Taub >她拒绝了求婚
<17-6,Taub >She turned down a proposal.

545
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,050
<17-6,Taub >你觉得她这场戏要演多久
<17-6,Taub >How long a game you think she's playing?

546
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,770
<17-7,Thirteen >我觉得如果她十四个小时后同意了
<17-7,Thirteen >I think if she said yes after 14 hours,

547
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:25,010
<17-7,Thirteen >他也会怀疑的
<17-7,Thirteen >even he'd be suspicious.

548
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:27,240
<17-8,Taub >作为才貌双全的女人你很幸运  因为
<17-8,Taub >You're lucky you're hot and smart, because--

549
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:30,910
<17-8,Taub >才貌双全真的是很幸运了
<17-8,Taub >well, you're just lucky you're hot and smart.

550
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,220
<17-8,Taub >我要找个妓女
<17-8,Taub >I need a hooker.

551
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:52,380
<18-1,House >如果你练瑜伽有效就不用了
<18-1,House >Not if you can make that work.

552
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:55,740
<18-2,Foreman >那样怎么能放松呢
<18-2,Foreman >How is that supposed to relax you?

553
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:58,850
<18-2,Foreman >不是我  是奇斯
<18-2,Foreman >It's not for me. It's for Chase.

554
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:00,320
<18-3,House >我也想要
<18-3,House >I'm saving myself too.

555
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,740
<18-3,House >不如你多找一个跟他组队好了
<18-3,House >Maybe you should get a couple.

556
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,320
<18-4,Foreman >你总是找我麻烦  为什么不找他呢
<18-4,Foreman >You're riding me. Why not ride him?

557
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,540
<18-5,House >因为我能让你血压升高
<18-5,House >Because I can get a rise out of your BP.

558
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,140
<18-5,House >却只能让他更"性奋"
<18-5,House >His pp on the other hand...

559
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:09,660
<18-5,House >放弃瑜伽信奉禅宗吧
<18-5,House >Forget yoga. Embrace Zen.

560
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:11,260
<18-5,House >你就是忧郁的白痴
<18-5,House >You're a repressed idiot.

561
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:12,330
<18-5,House >他是个性感的白痴
<18-5,House >He's a horny idiot.

562
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:13,750
<18-5,House >你俩对此都无能为力
<18-5,House >Neither one of you can do anything about it.

563
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:16,210
<18-5,House >应该是禅宗没错
<18-5,House >Pretty sure that's Zen.

564
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:40,100
<19-1,House >我还以为是要在卡迪的办公室碰面
<19-1,House >Thought we were meeting in Cuddy's office.

565
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:43,280
<19-2,Wilson >我把手术室里的无线频率追踪器
<19-2,Wilson >And I put one of the radio frequency tagged sponges from the O.R.

566
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:44,340
<19-2,Wilson >放到你的移动电视里了
<19-2,Wilson >in your portable television.

567
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,180
<19-3,Cuddy >无论对你来说有多难以接受
<19-3,Cuddy >However much it hurt,

568
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:47,640
<19-3,Cuddy >我确实有和你分手的权利
<19-3,Cuddy >I did have a right to break up with you.

569
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:49,910
<19-4,House >你只是希望为每件事找个私人原因
<19-4,House >You just want everything to have a hidden personal agenda.

570
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:50,740
<19-5,Cuddy >你得接受这一事实
<19-5,Cuddy >You need to get over it

571
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:53,350
<19-5,Cuddy >而非想尽一切办法破坏我们的工作
<19-5,Cuddy >instead of torpedoing our jobs out of spite.

572
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:55,230
<19-6,House >我可没办法像你那么惹人烦
<19-6,House >Couldn't just be that you're a pain professionally.

573
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:56,040
<19-6,House >都给我住嘴
<19-6,House >Stop!

574
00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:58,200
<19-7,Wilson >你们俩个都有错
<19-7,Wilson >You're both at fault here.

575
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,980
<19-7,Wilson >你知道豪斯的为人处事
<19-7,Wilson >You for trying to manipulate House

576
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:01,060
<19-7,Wilson >却还是想试图操控他
<19-7,Wilson >when you used to know better,

577
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:04,190
<19-7,Wilson >而你错在  继续做你的混蛋
<19-7,Wilson >and you for... Being you,

578
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:06,430
<19-7,Wilson >尤其在当下  无异于是雪上加霜
<19-7,Wilson >which an especially bad idea under the circumstances.

579
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:08,010
<19-8,House >我有很多好理由
<19-8,House >I had good reasons.

580
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,300
<19-9,Wilson >你的逻辑没人能接受
<19-9,Wilson >You had lame rationalizations.

581
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,510
<19-10,Cuddy >即使我没那么做
<19-10,Cuddy >If I hadn't played him,

582
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,990
<19-10,Cuddy >他还是会知道见面的事情  一样会捣乱
<19-10,Cuddy >he'd have found out about the meeting and crashed it anyway.

583
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:15,040
<19-11,House >但那就不用绕这么大个圈子
<19-11,House >Would have been a lot more efficient.

584
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:16,890
<19-12,Wilson >够了  你们听好了
<19-12,Wilson >Enough! Okay, here's what's gonna happen.

585
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,230
<19-12,Wilson >明天我开车带你们俩个去艾琳家
<19-12,Wilson >Tomorrow I drive both of you to Arlene's.

586
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:21,230
<19-12,Wilson >你给她写一张三万块的支票
<19-12,Wilson >You're gonna write her a personal check for $30,000,

587
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:22,610
<19-12,Wilson >告诉她你愿意让她住在
<19-12,Wilson >and tell her she can stay in her own home

588
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:23,400
<19-12,Wilson >自己的房子里
<19-12,Wilson >with your blessing.

589
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,570
<19-12,Wilson >你一定要这么做
<19-12,Wilson >You're gonna do this

590
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:26,690
<19-12,Wilson >因为你把工作  医院
<19-12,Wilson >because you actually give a crap about your job

591
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:29,260
<19-12,Wilson >还有你母亲都看得很重
<19-12,Wilson >and this hospital and your mother,

592
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,480
<19-12,Wilson >你甚至也在乎豪斯
<19-12,Wilson >and possibly even House.

593
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,970
<19-12,Wilson >而你  要说"对不起"
<19-12,Wilson >And you're gonna say, "I'm sorry,"

594
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:34,970
<19-12,Wilson >除此之外不要再多说一个字
<19-12,Wilson >and not utter one syllable more.

595
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:35,850
<19-13,House >因为我是个白痴吗
<19-13,House >Because I'm an idiot?

596
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:37,930
<19-14,Wilson >不  因为你不这样做  我会让药房
<19-14,Wilson >No, because if you don't, I'm gonna tell the pharmacy

597
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:40,960
<19-14,Wilson >停止发放所有以我的名义开的维柯丁
<19-14,Wilson >to stop issuing Vicodin prescriptions in my name.

598
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,850
<19-15,House >我可不是为了猜对你耍诡计做弥补
<19-15,House >I'm not paying for guess.

599
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,550
<20-1,Cyrus >有什么变化吗
<20-1,Cyrus >Anything look different?

600
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:54,100
<20-2,Thirteen >还没有
<20-2,Thirteen >Not yet.

601
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,770
<20-2,Thirteen >詹妮弗人呢
<20-2,Thirteen >Where's Jennifer?

602
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:58,540
<20-3,Cyrus >她跑去偷我瑞士银行账户里的钱了
<20-3,Cyrus >She's embezzling money from my Swiss bank account.

603
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,020
<20-3,Cyrus >你就是这么想的  对不对
<20-3,Cyrus >That's what you think, isn't it?

604
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,830
<20-3,Cyrus >她在骗我
<20-3,Cyrus >I'm being taken for a ride?

605
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,030
<20-4,Thirteen >我在想如果你还在靠修冰箱过活
<20-4,Thirteen >I think she wouldn't be here

606
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:08,360
<20-4,Thirteen >她就不会来了
<20-4,Thirteen >if you were still fixing refrigerators.

607
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:10,950
<20-4,Thirteen >所谓本性难移
<20-4,Thirteen >One random set of numbers

608
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:13,090
<20-4,Thirteen >一组随机中奖号码改变不了什么
<20-4,Thirteen >doesn't change human nature.

609
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:16,220
<20-5,Cyrus >但正是彩票给了我希望
<20-5,Cyrus >Those sets of numbers are what kept me going.

610
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:17,950
<20-5,Cyrus >紧握着那些彩票
<20-5,Cyrus >Clutching those tickets,

611
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:20,690
<20-5,Cyrus >畅想我以后的生活
<20-5,Cyrus >thinking about the life I could have,

612
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:22,100
<20-5,Cyrus >和詹妮弗重逢
<20-5,Cyrus >finding Jennifer again.

613
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,280
<20-6,Thirteen >所以你认为一个做了很久的梦实现之后
<20-6,Thirteen >So you figure if one long-shot dream came true

614
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,870
<20-6,Thirteen >另一个也会实现
<20-6,Thirteen >the other one will as well?

615
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:28,670
<20-7,Cyrus >你觉得你是在保护我
<20-7,Cyrus >You think you're protecting me.

616
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,780
<20-7,Cyrus >我却觉得你很可悲
<20-7,Cyrus >I think you're sad.

617
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,380
<20-7,Cyrus >见不得别人幸福
<20-7,Cyrus >Can't stand to see somebody happy.

618
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:45,870
<21-1,Cuddy >妈  这是支票
<21-1,Cuddy >Mom, here's a check.

619
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:47,910
<21-1,Cuddy >算是对你所遭受一切的补偿
<21-1,Cuddy >It's a settlement for all you've been through.

620
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:49,290
<21-1,Cuddy >你当然可以住在自己家里
<21-1,Cuddy >Of course you can stay in your home.

621
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:51,490
<21-1,Cuddy >我不应该提出其它异议
<21-1,Cuddy >It was wrong of me to suggest otherwise.

622
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,560
<26-15,Phil >对不起
<26-15,Phil >I'm sorry.

623
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,590
<21-1,Cuddy >我们不该自作主张救了你
<21-1,Cuddy >That we saved your life.

624
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,270
<21-2,House >我们处理的方式确实不太好
<21-2,House >In the way that we did.

625
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:06,460
<21-3,Wilson >良减
<21-3,Wilson >B-plus.

626
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:08,690
<21-3,Wilson >我希望现在我们可以冰释前嫌了
<21-3,Wilson >I hope this resolves everything.

627
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:11,600
<21-3,Wilson >可以说不管是你女儿还是豪斯医生
<21-3,Wilson >I can tell you that both your daughter and Dr. House--

628
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,690
<21-4,Arlene >这是三万块
<21-4,Arlene >This is 30 grand.

629
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,080
<21-5,Wilson >这是你要求的数目
<21-5,Wilson >Which is what you asked for.

630
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,570
<21-6,Arlene >这只够补偿我经受的痛苦与折磨
<21-6,Arlene >This covers pain and suffering.

631
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:18,490
<21-6,Arlene >遗嘱认证律师的费用怎么办
<21-6,Arlene >What about the probate lawyer?

632
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:20,320
<21-7,Wilson >你们两位是不是...
<21-7,Wilson >Do you two...

633
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,520
<21-8,Arlene >这样一来  我不得不去改遗嘱
<21-8,Arlene >I have to change my will,

634
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,930
<21-8,Arlene >把所有财产留给朱丽叶
<21-8,Arlene >leave everything to Julia

635
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:26,050
<21-8,Arlene >好让这个女儿不再耍阴招
<21-8,Arlene >so this one doesn't try more funny business

636
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:27,880
<21-8,Arlene >以图占据我的家
<21-8,Arlene >to get control of my home.

637
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,190
<21-9,Wilson >我想我们可以再多付2500块
<21-9,Wilson >I'm sure we can toss in another 2,500.

638
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,400
<21-10,Cuddy >那我想今晚我就得杀了你了
<21-10,Cuddy >Well, I guess I'll have to kill you tonight then.

639
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:34,450
<21-10,Cuddy >妈  我没兴趣去惦记...
<21-10,Cuddy >Mom, I'm not interested in--

640
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:36,310
<21-11,Arlene >你都已经认为你能控制我的身体了
<21-11,Arlene >You already think you own my body.

641
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:37,600
<21-11,Arlene >难道不会惦记我的房子吗
<21-11,Arlene >Why not my home too?

642
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,310
<21-12,Wilson >大家冷静一点...
<21-12,Wilson >Everybody stay calm, and--

643
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:41,790
<21-13,Cuddy >你一定要赶走所有想要帮助你的人吗
<21-13,Cuddy >You have to lash out at everyone who tries to help you?

644
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:44,200
<21-13,Cuddy >你就自己住这小地方吧  我才不在乎
<21-13,Cuddy >Live in your own kitchen sink for all I care.

645
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:45,620
<21-14,House >真犀利
<21-14,House >Harsh.

646
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:47,180
<21-14,House >我觉得你从没这样过
<21-14,House >I didn't think you had a case before,

647
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:49,470
<21-14,House >但可不能用这种态度对待病人
<21-14,House >but that is no way to talk to a patient.

648
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,490
<21-15,Arlene >你说的没错
<21-15,Arlene >You are right.

649
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:07,080
<22-1,Foreman >奇斯盯上这姑娘有好几个月了
<22-1,Foreman >Chase has had his eyes on this one for months.

650
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:09,260
<22-2,Taub >你是说他对她有意思
<22-2,Taub >Meaning he has eyes?

651
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,810
<22-3,Foreman >我给了这姑娘一百
<22-3,Foreman >I paid her 100 bucks.

652
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:11,730
<22-3,Foreman >今晚  或者下周
<22-3,Foreman >When he hits on her--

653
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:13,930
<22-3,Foreman >只要他对她采取攻势
<22-3,Foreman >might be tonight, might be next week--

654
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:16,290
<22-3,Foreman >她就扇奇斯一巴掌走人
<22-3,Foreman >she's gonna slap him and storm off.

655
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:19,220
<22-4,Taub >你的计划是想证明你们俩个
<22-4,Taub >So your plan is to prove you're both full of crap

656
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:20,560
<22-4,Taub >都是废物吗
<22-4,Taub >all in one move?

657
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,070
<22-5,Foreman >第一  他会称赞她的头发
<22-5,Foreman >First he'll compliment her hair.

658
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:23,900
<22-5,Foreman >活跃下气氛
<22-5,Foreman >That's how he breaks the ice.

659
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:28,230
<22-5,Foreman >接下来  他要说点笑话小故事什么的
<22-5,Foreman >Next comes some kind of joke or story.

660
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:29,730
<22-5,Foreman >就要准备开始他的柔情攻势了
<22-5,Foreman >He's sharpening his harpoon.

661
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:32,190
<22-6,Taub >我的行为也是这么有规律吗
<22-6,Taub >Are my moves this predictable?

662
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:35,180
<22-7,Foreman >她会抓住他的手臂
<22-7,Foreman >She's grabbing his arm.

663
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,140
<22-7,Foreman >他就要出手了
<22-7,Foreman >He's going in for the kill.

664
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,520
<22-8,Taub >别太在意了
<22-8,Taub >Don't let it get to you.

665
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:13,510
<23-1,Taub >我们在火上浇了好些油了
<23-1,Taub >Poured a lot of gas on the fire.

666
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:16,560
<23-1,Taub >超声波能让我们看清肿瘤的发展
<23-1,Taub >Ultrasound will give us a good look at the damage.

667
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,920
<23-1,Taub >再来一点检测剂
<23-1,Taub >Little more gel.

668
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,420
<23-2,Cyrus >我还没立过遗嘱呢
<23-2,Cyrus >I never made a will.

669
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:21,140
<23-2,Cyrus >如果我发生了什么  我想为你做点准备...
<23-2,Cyrus >I want to provide for you, if I don't--

670
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:22,830
<23-3,Jennifer >别瞎说了  行吗
<23-3,Jennifer >Stop it, will you?

671
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:24,760
<23-4,Taub >请憋气
<23-4,Taub >Like you to hold your breath for a sec.

672
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:28,560
<23-5,Jennifer >你的钱  应该用到慈善事业和其它需要上
<23-5,Jennifer >Your money, there's charities, causes.

673
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,980
<23-5,Jennifer >比如留给你的家人
<23-5,Jennifer >Your family.

674
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,050
<23-5,Jennifer >你应该问问自己  这么多年以来
<23-5,Jennifer >You got to ask yourself what's mattered to you most

675
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:34,740
<23-5,Jennifer >什么对你最重要
<23-5,Jennifer >year in and year out.

676
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,660
<23-6,Taub >不应该是这样
<23-6,Taub >That can't be right.

677
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,250
<23-7,Cyrus >是坏消息吗
<23-7,Cyrus >Is it bad news?

678
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:43,790
<23-7,Cyrus >不
<23-7,Cyrus >No.

679
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:47,140
<23-8,Taub >我们已经在给你输生长因子
<23-8,Taub >We've been pumping you with growth factor,

680
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:50,050
<23-8,Taub >但你的癌细胞并没有进一步发展
<23-8,Taub >but you don't have any new cancers.

681
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:54,360
<23-8,Taub >肿瘤全都收缩了
<23-8,Taub >The tumors you had all shrank.

682
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:59,210
<24-1,Foreman >三个肿瘤的消失说明
<24-1,Foreman >Three tumors disappearing means we were probably wrong

683
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:01,530
<24-1,Foreman >之前我们缺失抑癌基因的诊断是错的
<24-1,Foreman >about him missing a tumor-suppressor gene.

684
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:03,610
<24-2,Chase >有了上次的结果  你还不死心啊
<24-2,Chase >How many mulligans are you gonna ask for?

685
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:06,190
<24-3,Foreman >这个测试才是我血压上升的原因
<24-3,Foreman >This test is what raised my blood pressure.

686
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:08,020
<24-3,Foreman >不过我现在习惯了
<24-3,Foreman >I'm used to it now.

687
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,440
<24-3,Foreman >开始吧
<24-3,Foreman >Go.

688
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:13,100
<24-3,Foreman >如果是自身免疫系统
<24-3,Foreman >If it's autoimmune

689
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,470
<24-3,Foreman >和他自身产生了
<24-3,Foreman >and he created antibodies

690
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:16,440
<24-3,Foreman >终止肿瘤发展的抗体
<24-3,Foreman >that ended up fighting his own tumors...

691
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,520
<24-4,House >生长因子就能够
<24-4,House >Growth factor would have made

692
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,420
<24-4,House >改善他的自身免疫情况
<24-4,House >the underlying autoimmune condition better.

693
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,490
<24-5,Taub >或许他的病因就不是癌症
<24-5,Taub >Maybe it was never cancer in the first place.

694
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:23,610
<24-5,Taub >当然是癌  我们活检证实了
<24-5,Taub >Of course it was cancer. We biopsied.

695
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:27,250
<24-6,Thirteen >可能是假阳性
<24-6,Thirteen >It could have been a false positive.

696
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:28,840
<24-6,Thirteen >淀粉样变性呢
<24-6,Thirteen >Amyloidosis?

697
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:31,420
<24-6,Thirteen >他心电图的电压是正常范围内的低值
<24-6,Thirteen >His EKG voltage has been on the low end of normal.

698
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:34,320
<24-6,Thirteen >如果肿瘤其实是蛋白质沉积物呢
<24-6,Thirteen >What if the tumors were actually protein deposits?

699
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:38,120
<24-7,House >给他做消化道活检  开始化疗
<24-7,House >G.I. biopsy to confirm, chemo to treat.

700
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,390
<24-8,Foreman >她的诊断依据是
<24-8,Foreman >She's making that diagnosis

701
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:41,570
<24-8,Foreman >病人的心电图电压为正常范围内的低值
<24-8,Foreman >based off of low-normal EKG.

702
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:43,240
<24-8,Foreman >正常范围内的低值还是正常
<24-8,Foreman >Low-normal is still normal.

703
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:46,950
<24-8,Foreman >这仪器肯定是出问题了
<24-8,Foreman >That thing cannot be right.

704
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:48,770
<24-8,Foreman >正常范围内的低值也是低值
<24-8,Foreman >Low-normal is still low,

705
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:49,770
<24-9,House >而且这个仪器出问题的话
<24-9,House >and that thing does not have money

706
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:51,110
<24-9,House >它又得不到好处
<24-9,House >riding on you being wrong,

707
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:52,140
<24-9,House >我们其他人可就不是了
<24-9,House >like the rest of us do.

708
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,250
<24-10,Foreman >奇斯搞的鬼
<24-10,Foreman >Chase fixed this.

709
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:55,020
<24-11,Thirteen >我想你是把奇斯和福曼搞混了吧
<24-11,Thirteen >Oh, I think you're confusing Chase and Foreman.

743
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:30,960
<25-4,House >但我事不过三
<25-4,House >but I don't have thirds.

744
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,050
<25-5,Wilson >卡迪基本上也是这么跟她说的
<25-5,Wilson >Cuddy told her the same thing, more or less.

<25-6,House >终于有件事让我们的意见统一了

<25-9,Wilson >你还忘不了卡迪
<25-9,Wilson >You don't want to let go of Cuddy,

750
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:44,580
<25-9,Wilson >所以你持不合作态度
<25-9,Wilson >so you're clinging to the negative interaction,

751
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,960
<25-9,Wilson >因为你潜意识中觉得
<25-9,Wilson >because some small part of you

<25-9,Wilson >相互折磨比形同陌路好

00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,430
<25-11,Wilson >事情不是你挑起的
<25-11,Wilson >You didn't start it,

757
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:58,890
<25-11,Wilson >但是你在有机会结束时  却没有那么做
<25-11,Wilson >but you had the chance to end it, and you didn't.

760
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,890
<25-11,Wilson >但你现在这么做  不仅会毁掉你的工作

<28-7,Cuddy >不是我们错施良药  你早没命了
<28-7,Cuddy >You'd be dead if it weren't for our mistreatment.

832
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,940
<28-7,Cuddy >可你居然还能找到抱怨的理由
<28-7,Cuddy >And somehow you'd still find something to whine about.

833
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:29,680
<28-8,Arlene >我们还是让法庭判断是谁在抱怨吧
<28-8,Arlene >We'll let the court decide who's whining,

834
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,530
<28-8,Arlene >既然你如此坚信...
<28-8,Arlene >since you're so sure...

<28-11,House >她为何一直威胁
<28-11,House >Why she keeps making threats

00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:42,140
<28-11,House >却迟迟不递交

<29-1,House >与脑内的神经元细胞没有多大差别
<29-1,House >between brain cells in your abdomen and brain cells in your brain.
