1
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:12,980
<33-1,Wilson>快跑  快跑
<33-1,Wilson>Run, run is all that.

2
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:15,270
<1-2,Brian>我已经犯心脏病了
<1-2,Brian>I already have a heart attack.

3
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:55,430
<1-3,Brian>别想逃  小子
<1-3,Brian>Don't wanna go, buddy.

4
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,450
<1-4,Brian>没搞错吧 我们追的是人吗
<1-4,Brian>What the hell was that? What we're chasing?

5
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:01,250
<1-5,Donny>你去那边
<1-5,Donny>Go that way!

6
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,040
<2-1,Brian>别动
<2-1,Brian>Don't move!

7
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:21,870
<2-2,Cop>别想逃 投降吧
<2-2,Cop>Don't want go! Give it up!

8
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,770
<2-4,Cop 2>这边 快快
<2-4,Cop 2>Come this way! Come on, Let's go! Let's go!

9
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,230
<2-5,Brian>天呐  他要爬到屋顶去了
<2-5,Brian>Oh, god. He's going to the roof.

10
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:32,490
<2-4,Cop 2>快快
<2-4,Cop 2>Come on, go!

11
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,500
<3-1,Brian>妈的
<3-1,Brian>Damn it!

12
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,560
<3-1,Brian>快  快
<3-1,Brian>Go, go!

13
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,200
<4-1,Brian>不  唐尼  不要 太远了
<4-1,Brian>No, Donny, no. It's too far.

14
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,240
<4-1,Brian>我可以在家休养
<4-1,Brian>I can rest at home.

15
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,680
<4-1,Brian>两天内你就别想离开了
<4-1,Brian>We can't release you for at least two days.

16
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,110
<5-1,Donny>你断了两根骨头  严重的脑震荡
<5-1,Donny>You have two broken bones, a severe concussion,

17
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:13,070
<5-2,Cameron>肺也受了伤
<5-2,Cameron>Collapsed lung.

18
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,670
<5-3,Donny>但死不了人  对吗
<5-3,Donny>But you didn't find anything life-threatening, right?

19
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,750
<5-4,Cameron>你从30英尺高摔下来  你差点就死了
<5-4,Cameron>You fell 30 feet. You should have died.

20
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,520
<5-5,Brian>这才是重点 你能闭嘴吗
<5-5,Brian>I think that was the point. Could you shut up?

21
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,300
<5-7,Cameron>你是想自杀
<5-7,Cameron>You have suicidal thoughts?

22
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,630
<5-8,Donny>想都没想过  完全没有
<5-8,Donny>Not once. Never.

23
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,900
<5-9,Brian>他不想自杀
<5-9,Brian>He doesn't want to kill himself.

24
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,290
<5-9,Brian>他只是觉得自己快死了
<5-9,Brian>He just thinks he's gonna die soon,

25
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:27,130
<5-9,Brian>所以就无所谓了  现在你闭嘴
<5-9,Brian>So it doesn't really matter, now you shut up.

26
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:28,360
<5-9,Brian>你每次出状况
<5-9,Brian>I'm the one you're not covering

27
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,190
<5-9,Brian>可都是我担着
<5-9,Brian>When you pull your crazy stunts.

28
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:31,780
<5-10,Cameron>你为什么觉得自己快死了
<5-10,Cameron>Why do you think you're gonna die soon?

29
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:34,940
<5-11,Donny>我父亲  祖父  曾祖父
<5-11,Donny>Well, my dad, grandfather, and great-grandfather

30
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,220
<5-11,Donny>都在40岁时
<5-11,Donny>All dropped dead of heart problems

31
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,340
<5-11,Donny>因心脏问题猝死
<5-11,Donny>Right after they turned 40.

32
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,870
<5-12,Brian>某人下周就满40了
<5-12,Brian>Look who turns 40 next week.

33
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:41,490
<5-13,Cameron>我可以给你推荐一位心脏科权威  如果你 都去过了
<5-13,Cameron>I can refer you to a cardiologist, if you-- Nah, I've been there,

34
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,440
<5-14,Donny>所有人
<5-14,Donny>All of them.

35
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,890
<5-14,Donny>30出头时  我就不停地看医生
<5-14,Donny>I spent my early 30s going from one doctor to another.

36
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:46,450
<5-14,Donny>每个人都说我的心脏很健康
<5-14,Donny>Every single one says my heart's fine.

37
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:48,600
<5-15,Cameron>-而你觉得他们错了  -我知道他们错了
<5-15,Cameron>- And you think they're wrong?  - I know they're wrong.

38
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:49,760
<5-16,Donny>但我能怎么办
<5-16,Donny>But what can I do?

39
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:51,880
<5-16,Donny>话说回来  日子还得继续过
<5-16,Donny>At a certain point, you just got to live your life.

40
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:52,640
<5-17,Brian>说到过日子
<5-17,Brian>By live your life,

41
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,980
<5-17,Brian>你是指到处找死
<5-17,Brian>You mean risk your life.

42
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,830
<5-18,Cameron>如果你真的生病了
<5-18,Cameron>If there is something wrong,

43
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,580
<5-18,Cameron>我知道有位医生能找出病因
<5-18,Cameron>I know a doctor who will find it.

44
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,440
<6-1,Wilson>靠  我过十分钟再来
<6-1,Wilson>Oh, god! I'll be back in ten.

45
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:08,600
<6-2,House>我在撕肚脐上的汗毛
<6-2,House>I'm picking lint out of my belly button.

46
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,750
<6-3,Wilson>少瞎扯了
<6-3,Wilson>This is ridiculous.

47
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,400
<6-3,Wilson>我要把书房改成卧室
<6-3,Wilson>I'm converting the study into a bedroom.

48
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:14,780
<6-4,House>6周了
<6-4,House>Six weeks.

49
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,120
<6-4,House>比我预计的要长
<6-4,House>Longer than I thought it would take...

50
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,140
<6-4,House>我可是一直睡在你家客厅
<6-4,House>For you to notice that I'm sleeping in your living room,

51
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,520
<6-4,House>你也不给我找个好地方
<6-4,House>And offer other options.

52
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,390
<6-5,Wilson>我没想到你会呆这么久
<6-5,Wilson>I didn't expect you to be here this long.

53
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:24,840
<6-6,House>没错  但不是你继续容忍我的原因
<6-6,House>True, but that's not why you didn't extend the invitation.

54
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,810
<6-7,Wilson>你真要深入分析这件事
<6-7,Wilson>Do you really need to deconstruct this?

55
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:29,020
<6-8,House>你不想让我睡在你跟安波儿睡过的床
<6-8,House>You didn't want me to sleep where you and Amber slept.

56
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,910
<6-9,Wilson>-是  没错  -她死后
<6-9,Wilson>- Okay, yes, you do.  - After she died,

57
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,460
<6-10,House>你把书房改成卧室
<6-10,House>You converted the study to a bedroom

58
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,720
<6-10,House>把卧室变为书房
<6-10,House>And the bedroom to a study...

59
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,040
<6-10,House>但卧室终究不是书房  是圣殿
<6-10,House>Except it's not a study, it's a shrine.

60
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:38,890
<6-10,House>恕我直言
<6-10,House>Can I tell you something?

61
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,060
<6-10,House>我其实没在拔毛
<6-10,House>I wasn't picking lint out of my belly button.

62
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:42,410
<6-11,Wilson>够了
<6-11,Wilson>Okay.

63
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:44,520
<6-11,Wilson>我还没准备好把话题
<6-11,Wilson>I am not ready to transition

64
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,360
<6-11,Wilson>从我去世女友的圣殿
<6-11,Wilson>From my dead girlfriend's shrine

65
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,350
<6-11,Wilson>转移到你的...晨练
<6-11,Wilson>To your... Morning glory.

66
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,430
<6-11,Wilson>之后会有床垫送来
<6-11,Wilson>I'll have a mattress delivered

67
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,110
<6-11,Wilson>装好后让你睡
<6-11,Wilson>And set up for you in the tabernacle.

68
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:53,860
<6-11,Wilson>只需每周二还我  我要杀生拜祭
<6-11,Wilson>I just need it tuesdays for animal sacrifices.

69
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:56,800
<6-11,Wilson>天啊
<6-11,Wilson>Oh, man!

70
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,450
<7-1,Cameron>这病人是颗拴在遗传链上的定时炸弹
<7-1,Cameron>Patient's a genetic time bomb.

71
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,730
<7-2,House>没有导火索
<7-2,House>There's no fuse.

72
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:04,500
<7-2,House>就不是炸弹
<7-2,House>He's not a bomb.

73
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,150
<7-2,House>现在  他连病人都不是
<7-2,House>Right now he's not a patient either.

74
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,830
<7-3,Foreman>你要我们无视他祖上三代的心脏病吗
<7-3,Foreman>You saying we ignore three generations of cardiac problems?

75
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:09,760
<7-4,House>不是无视
<7-4,House>I'm not ignoring it.

76
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,740
<7-4,House>是巧合
<7-4,House>I'm labeling it a coincidence.

77
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,670
<7-5,Cameron>你讨厌巧合
<7-5,Cameron>You hate coincidence.

78
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:16,160
<7-6,House>我们达成一致了  这是一回事
<7-6,House>We reconciled. It was a whole thing.

79
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:16,920
<7-6,House>广袤大地
<7-6,House>Big country.

80
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:18,800
<7-6,House>一家三代都因非遗传性心脏病
<7-6,House>It's statistically probable that someone

81
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,010
<7-6,House>在40岁左右归西
<7-6,House>Has three generations that died around age 40

82
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:22,630
<7-6,House>统计理论上是有可能的
<7-6,House>With nongenetic heart issues.

83
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,670
<7-7,Cameron>霉运可不长记性 基因长
<7-7,Cameron>Dice have no memory. Genes do.

84
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:27,630
<7-8,House>如果每遇这种状况
<7-8,House>If we ran a battery of tests

85
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:28,440
<7-8,House>就进行一堆的检查...
<7-8,House>On every nonsymptomatic statistical anomaly--

86
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,120
<7-9,Cameron>这人会在40岁会死掉  这个心里阴影
<7-9,Cameron>The guy goes every day

87
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,480
<7-9,Cameron>伴随着他每一天的生活
<7-9,Cameron>Assuming his life will end at age 40.

88
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,670
<7-9,Cameron>所以不结婚  不要孩子
<7-9,Cameron>Never got married, no kids,

89
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:35,060
<7-9,Cameron>因为他不想同他父亲一样 死在他们面前
<7-9,Cameron>Because he didn't want to die on them the same way his dad died on him.

90
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:37,040
<7-10,House>你想接这个案子
<7-10,House>You want to take this case

91
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,530
<7-10,House>因为他不过是一只孤独可怜的小狗狗
<7-10,House>'Cause he's yet another lonely, sad puppy.

92
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:39,720
<7-10,House>你该去做兽医
<7-10,House>You should have been a vet.

93
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,960
<7-11,Cameron>这案子有理有据
<7-11,Cameron>It's a legitimate case.

94
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,520
<7-12,Foreman>对心脏进行遗传性鉴别诊断
<7-12,Foreman>Differential diagnosis for genetic heart conditions.

95
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,400
<7-13,House>你吃这套吗
<7-13,House>That sold you?

96
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,420
<7-14,Chase>马方综合症  布鲁加达综合症 还有你
<7-14,Chase>Marfan syndrome, Brugada. And you?

97
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,030
<7-16,Chase>高胆固醇血症
<7-16,Chase>Emilio hypercholesterolemia.

98
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:50,950
<7-17,House>他附和你
<7-17,House>He's only agreeing with you

99
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,280
<7-17,House>是因为想睡了你
<7-17,House>'cause he wants to have sex with you.

100
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,010
<7-17,House>顺带一提  我也很赞同你
<7-17,House>And by the way, I agree with you too,

101
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:55,360
<7-17,House>尤其是你的底裤
<7-17,House>Especially in those pants.

102
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,470
<7-17,House>我们绝对没有在浪费时间
<7-17,House>We're not wasting our time.

103
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,300
<7-17,House>上周  奇斯说我才是真正的头儿
<7-17,House>And last week, Chase said that I was the de facto boss.

104
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,080
<7-18,Foreman>要真正的行医执照  医院才买账
<7-18,Foreman>Hospitals don't recognize de facto medical licenses.

105
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,250
<7-18,Foreman>从基因检测开始
<7-18,Foreman>Let's start with genetic tests.

106
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,890
<7-18,Foreman>做心电图  心导管检查
<7-18,Foreman>Get an EK, cardiac cath--

107
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:08,170
<7-18,Foreman>通过回波检查心脏完整性
<7-18,Foreman>And an echo to check the integrity of his heart.

108
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,140
<8-1,Cameron>我先检查血样
<8-1,Cameron>I'll start on blood samples.

109
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,790
<8-2,Chase>我忘了戴表
<8-2,Chase>I forgot my watch.

110
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:30,780
<8-3,Cameron>我发誓早上看见你戴了 一定是落在更衣室了
<8-3,Cameron>Could have sworn I saw you put it on this morning. Must be in the locker room.

111
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:31,710
<8-4,Chase>一会儿就来
<8-4,Chase>I'll be right back.

112
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,330
<9-1,Cuddy>我想知道你的打算
<9-1,Cuddy>I need to know what your plans are.

113
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,960
<9-1,Cuddy>首先拿下柏林
<9-1,Cuddy>First we take Berlin.

114
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,940
<9-2,House>接着迂回偷袭波兰
<9-2,House>And then we circle around behind Poland

115
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,050
<9-2,House>然后欢呼  哦耶
<9-2,House>And yell, "surprise!"

116
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,590
<9-3,Cuddy>我指你的工作
<9-3,Cuddy>With regards to your employment.

117
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,610
<9-4,House>我喜欢事物展示本来面目
<9-4,House>I like things the way they are.

118
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:52,110
<9-4,House>我有谜可解 而且没有你来蔑视我
<9-4,House>I get just enough puzzle to solve without the scornful visits from you...

119
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:53,180
<9-4,House>现在却没了
<9-4,House>Until now.

120
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,030
<9-5,Cuddy>装模作样时间已经够长
<9-5,Cuddy>Pretend time's been going on long enough.

121
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,480
<9-6,House>我没有行医执照  只能装模作样
<9-6,House>I don't have a medical license. All I can do is pretend.

122
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,930
<9-7,Cuddy>那从明天起我也开始
<9-7,Cuddy>And I'm gonna have payroll send you

123
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:00,860
<9-7,Cuddy>付你装模作样的支票
<9-7,Cuddy>Over some pretend checks starting tomorrow.

124
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:04,220
<9-7,Cuddy>要想拿回执照  你还得巡房120小时
<9-7,Cuddy>You need to complete 120 hours of rounds to re-qualify.

125
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:07,580
<9-7,Cuddy>不  我不要
<9-7,Cuddy>No, I don't.

126
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:09,810
<9-8,House>不是说你搞不定我
<9-8,House>I'm not saying you don't win.

127
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:11,780
<9-8,House>只是你真要让我替你的白痴手下
<9-8,House>I'm just saying do you really need to punish me

128
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:14,530
<9-8,House>举一星期的笔记板  来惩罚我吗
<9-8,House>By making me carry a clipboard for your lackey of the week?

129
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:15,870
<9-9,Cuddy>这是政府规定
<9-9,Cuddy>It's a state requirement.

130
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:18,040
<9-9,Cuddy>我必须证明你确实完全符合...
<9-9,Cuddy>I have to certify that you've completed all your require--

131
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,960
<9-10,House>完全正确
<9-10,House>Exactly.

132
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,130
<9-10,House>规定指定你必须做什么
<9-10,House>The requirement sets out what you have to do--

133
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:23,780
<9-10,House>证明嘛 你一只手也能做到
<9-10,House>Certify, Which you can do with one hand tied behind your back.

134
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,540
<9-10,House>现在  如果你想绑住我的双手
<9-10,House>Now, if you want to tie my hands...

135
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:28,530
<9-11,Cuddy>周四辛格医生负责监督巡房
<9-11,Cuddy>Dr. Singh supervises rounds on thursdays,

136
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,650
<9-11,Cuddy>7点开始
<9-11,Cuddy>Starts at 7:00.

137
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:37,710
<10-1,Chase>没有发现
<10-1,Chase>Nothing.

138
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:39,640
<10-2,Foreman>那现在呢
<10-2,Foreman>So what now?

139
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:40,570
<10-3,Chase>送他回家
<10-3,Chase>Send him home.

140
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,540
<10-4,Cameron>让他继续相信自己会猝死
<10-4,Cameron>To continue believing he's gonna drop dead?

141
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,340
<10-5,Chase>等他到七老八十  就会相信我们了
<10-5,Chase>When he turns 70, he'll believe us.

142
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:46,250
<10-6,Foreman>还有别的没查
<10-6,Foreman>There are other things we can check.

143
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,350
<10-6,Foreman>曾祖父的骨架保存完好
<10-6,Foreman>Skeleton of great-grandfather's in decent shape.

144
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:52,020
<11-1,Foreman>祖父的遗传物质也还在
<11-1,Foreman>Subsurface genetic material from grandpa's fine,

145
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,780
<11-1,Foreman>老爸就彻底的灰飞烟灭了
<11-1,Foreman>Leaving one bowl of purified dad.

146
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:54,890
<11-2,Chase>老爸归你
<11-2,Chase>You do the dad.

147
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:57,220
<11-2,Chase>我打赌他的棺材密封很好
<11-2,Chase>I take it he had a sealed casket.

148
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,660
<11-3,Foreman>手表的事是你瞎掰的吧
<11-3,Foreman>The watch story was crap, right?

149
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:02,280
<11-4,Chase>我忘了
<11-4,Chase>I forgot it.

150
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:03,840
<11-4,Chase>没什么大不了
<11-4,Chase>It's no big deal.

151
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:06,560
<11-5,Foreman>你想躲开 迪巴拉去世的那间重症监护室
<11-5,Foreman>You were avoiding the ICU where Dibala died.

152
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:10,930
<11-5,Foreman>我给心脏钠离子通道做个基因排序
<11-5,Foreman>I'll sequence the gene for the cardiac sodium channel.

153
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:14,190
<11-6,Chase>我当时觉得我快要惊恐了
<11-6,Chase>I felt like I was gonna have a panic attack.

154
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,760
<11-6,Chase>我已经跨过了这道坎...
<11-6,Chase>I've crossed some line...

155
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,610
<11-6,Chase>但却不知道如何回到原点
<11-6,Chase>And I'm having trouble getting back to the other side.

156
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:26,690
<11-7,Foreman>我可以给病人转移病房
<11-7,Foreman>I can move the patient to another room.

157
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,750
<11-8,Chase>卡梅隆会问的
<11-8,Chase>Cameron will ask questions.

158
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:29,880
<11-9,Foreman>你应该告诉她
<11-9,Foreman>You should tell her.

159
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,410
<11-9,Foreman>她是你老婆
<11-9,Foreman>She's your wife.

160
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,640
<11-10,Cameron>你们怎么这么快就拿到了掘坟的法庭许可
<11-10,Cameron>How'd you get a court order to dig them up so fast?

161
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,210
<11-11,Chase>只要他同意就可以了
<11-11,Chase>We just needed the guy's consent.

162
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:42,960
<11-12,Cameron>-找到什么线索吗  -还没
<11-12,Cameron>- You find anything?  - Not yet.

163
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,750
<11-13,Chase>不过你正好赶上给爸爸做检查
<11-13,Chase>But you're just in time to do the dad.

164
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,130
<12-1,Cheryl>豪斯医生在吗
<12-1,Cheryl>Doctor House?

165
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:52,590
<12-2,House>他明早会回来
<12-2,House>He'll be back in the morning.

166
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:55,130
<12-3,Cheryl>我在报纸上看到 你正在医治一名警官
<12-3,Cheryl>I read in the paper you're treating a police officer.

167
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,020
<12-3,Cheryl>-唐尼·康普森  -在二楼
<12-3,Cheryl>- Donny Compson?  - Second floor.

168
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,630
<12-4,House>护士会帮您找到他的
<12-4,House>A nurse will help you find him.

169
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:00,440
<12-5,Cheryl>我不想见他
<12-5,Cheryl>I don't want to see him.

170
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,900
<12-5,Cheryl>唐尼和我早就分手了
<12-5,Cheryl>Donny and I used to go out a long time ago.

171
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,800
<12-5,Cheryl>他不想见我  我也不想见他
<12-5,Cheryl>He doesn't want to see me. I don't want to see him.

172
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,950
<12-6,House>那么  你是找我来寻求感情建议吗
<12-6,House>So did you come to see me for personal advice?

173
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:08,650
<12-7,Cheryl>你们在寻找导致他父亲和祖父
<12-7,Cheryl>You're looking for genetic conditions, which makes sense,

174
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:11,350
<12-7,Cheryl>发病的控制基因  这很有意义
<12-7,Cheryl>With what happened to his dad and grandpa.

175
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,540
<12-8,House>除非你是他的女友  兼妹妹
<12-8,House>Unless you were his girlfriend and his sister,

176
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,760
<12-8,House>否则不必担心
<12-8,House>You got nothing to worry about.

177
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,990
<12-9,Cheryl>我不是担心我自己
<12-9,Cheryl>I'm not worried about me.

178
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,520
<12-9,Cheryl>唐尼还不知道
<12-9,Cheryl>Donny doesn't know this,

179
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,730
<12-9,Cheryl>他有个儿子
<12-9,Cheryl>But he has a son.

180
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,920
<12-10,House>拨打分机号742
<12-10,House>Dial extension 742.

181
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:27,250
<12-10,House>告诉福曼医生  你有猛料要爆
<12-10,House>Tell Dr. Foreman you got some cool information.

182
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:27,950
<12-10,House>晚安
<12-10,House>Good night.

183
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:26,190
<13-1,Wilson>你还好吗
<13-1,Wilson>You okay?

184
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,420
<13-2,House>没事
<13-2,House>Yeah, fine.

185
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,060
<13-2,House>在唐尼祖父辈的15个基因片段
<13-2,House>Couldn't find any consistent genetic mutations

186
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:06,820
<13-2,House>找不到任何相似的基因突变
<13-2,House>Across 15 areas between Donny's ancestors,

187
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,190
<14-1,Chase>很可能标明本来就没有
<14-1,Chase>Possibly indicating there isn't one.

188
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:09,550
<14-2,Cameron>但儿子给了我们一个新的数据接入点
<14-2,Cameron>But the son gives us a new data point.

189
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:10,730
<14-3,Foreman>一个未降解的DNA
<14-3,Foreman>And undegraded DNA.

190
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,650
<14-4,Chase>我觉得他不想要孩子
<14-4,Chase>I thought he didn't want kids.

191
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:13,000
<14-6,Foreman>-他没想  -豪斯在哪
<14-6,Foreman>- He didn't.  - Where's house?

192
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:14,410
<14-7,Chase>亲爱的多愁善感的宝贝儿们
<14-7,Chase>"Dear bleeding hearts,

193
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:17,650
<14-7,Chase>介于此位病人的传奇故事不过是个巧合
<14-7,Chase>"Since your patient's med history is a coincidence,

194
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:18,630
<14-7,Chase>而且他并没有
<14-7,Chase>"And he isn't...

195
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,120
<14-7,Chase>得病
<14-7,Chase>"Sick,

196
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,200
<14-7,Chase>所以我先回学校了
<14-7,Chase>"I've gone back to school.

197
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:24,680
<14-7,Chase>120小时后见
<14-7,Chase>Back in 120 hours."

198
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,240
<14-8,Cameron>牛人  我去取个血样
<14-8,Cameron>Charming. I'll get a blood sample.

199
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,410
<14-9,Foreman>如果我们要找到类似基因突变的细节
<14-9,Foreman>If we're looking for something as subtle as a mutation,

200
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,590
<14-9,Foreman>那么提取最纯的DNA就很重要
<14-9,Foreman>It makes sense to get the DNA where it's most pure.

201
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,000
<14-10,Chase>难道要请他母亲同意  给他来个骨髓活检
<14-10,Chase>You're gonna ask the mom to consent to a bone marrow biopsy?

202
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,460
<14-11,Cameron>如果她想一探唐尼的究竟
<14-11,Cameron>She wants to know if there's something wrong with Donny

203
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,770
<14-11,Cameron>那么最好听我们的
<14-11,Cameron>Just as badly as we do.

204
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:36,490
<14-11,Cameron>没错
<14-11,Cameron>Right.

205
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:38,960
<14-12,Chase>因为祖父的病而穿刺10岁小孩的屁股
<14-12,Chase>Spike a ten-year-old's hip because grandpa was sick.

206
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,900
<14-13,Foreman>如果她是对的...
<14-13,Foreman>If she's right...

207
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,090
<14-13,Foreman>我们就能救两个人了
<14-13,Foreman>We save two people.

208
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:47,860
<15-1,Michael>我不愿意
<15-1,Michael>I don't want to.

209
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,700
<15-2,Cameron>我们能出去谈谈吗
<15-2,Cameron>Can we speak outside for a moment?

210
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:53,370
<15-3,Cheryl>好的
<15-3,Cheryl>Yeah.

211
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,440
<15-4,Cameron>你应该告诉他
<15-4,Cameron>You need to tell him.

212
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,720
<15-5,Cheryl>不行
<15-5,Cheryl>I can't.

213
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,160
<15-6,Cameron>他的父亲从两栋楼之间
<15-6,Cameron>His father is down that hallway

214
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,170
<15-6,Cameron>跳了下来
<15-6,Cameron>Through those double doors.

215
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:07,830
<15-7,Cheryl>我一直没有告诉过他真相
<15-7,Cheryl>I've been lying to him his whole life.

216
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:08,910
<15-7,Cheryl>他会怎么想我
<15-7,Cheryl>What's he gonna think of me?

217
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,320
<15-8,Cameron>你在努力保护他
<15-8,Cameron>You're trying to protect him.

218
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:13,800
<15-9,Cheryl>唐尼从不想要孩子
<15-9,Cheryl>Donny never wanted kids.

219
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:15,660
<15-9,Cheryl>他当然也不想见他
<15-9,Cheryl>He certainly doesn't want to meet him.

220
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,010
<15-10,Cameron>如果唐尼死了  这是
<15-10,Cameron>If donny does die, this could be

221
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:20,040
<15-10,Cameron>麦克见他的唯一机会
<15-10,Cameron>Michael's only chance to meet his father.

222
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,920
<16-1,Nona>经过免疫球蛋白治疗
<16-1,Nona>After administration of immunoglobulin,

223
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,700
<16-1,Nona>病人已再无疼痛现象 而且隔夜肺功能检测显示正常
<16-1,Nona>Patient had no further pain, And overnight liver function tests are now normal.

224
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,140
<16-1,Nona>病人可以出院了
<16-1,Nona>Patient's ready to be released.

225
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,260
<16-1,Nona>数据在下降
<16-1,Nona>Stats are dropping.

226
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,160
<16-3,Nona>-辛格医生  -她窒息了
<16-3,Nona>- Doctor singh?  - She's choking.

227
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,890
<16-5,Nona>-用你的手指  -她不能呼吸
<16-5,Nona>- On your fingers. - She can't breathe.

228
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:47,480
<16-5,Nona>豪斯
<16-5,Nona>House...

229
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:50,390
<16-6,Singh>请把你的手指从检测按钮上拿开
<16-6,Singh>Please take your finger off the test button.

230
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,920
<16-7,House>明白了  非常抱歉
<16-7,House>I see. Wow, sorry about that.

231
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:56,600
<16-8,Marta>我差点切开她的喉管
<16-8,Marta>I could've slit her throat.

232
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,860
<16-9,House>我们都是来学习的
<16-9,House>Well, we're all here to learn.

233
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,460
<16-10,Singh>你知道  卡迪医生警告我要注意你
<16-10,Singh>You know, Dr. Cuddy warned me about you.

234
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,830
<16-11,House>她没告诉你怎么阻止我吗
<16-11,House>She tell you how to stop me?

<16-13,House>这显然不是她的作风
<16-13,House>Well, that obviously didn't come from her.

237

<16-15,House>通常从学生那里学到更多东西
<16-15,House>Can often learn more from the student.

250
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,910
<17-3,Cheryl>但有点晚了

<17-12,Michael>Maybe we could do something.

266
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,190
<17-12,Michael>比如看电影

<17-13,Donny>为了他好
<17-13,Donny>It's better.

<18-3,Cameron>让迈克尔做骨髓活检是唯一的方法
<18-3,Cameron>It was the only way to get Michael to do the marrow biopsy.

00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,270
<22-2,House>是我用薄荷糖送他回的家
<22-2,House>I sent the guy home with mints.

352
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,500
<22-3,Foreman>不管是什么病  我们都遗漏了
<22-3,Foreman>Whatever it is, we all missed it.

353
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:17,550
<22-4,House>我忽略了事情有遗漏的事实
<22-4,House>I missed the fact that there was something to miss.

354
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:21,020
<22-4,House>我这是怎么了
<22-4,House>What is wrong with me?

355
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:23,120
<22-5,Foreman>你有很好的理由
<22-5,Foreman>You had good reason.

356
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,510
<22-5,Foreman>病人没有表现出症状
<22-5,Foreman>Patient presented with no symptoms,

357
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:27,410
<22-5,Foreman>他的化验都是阴性的
<22-5,Foreman>And all his tests came back negative.

358
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,760
<22-6,House>官方死因是什么
<22-6,House>What's the official cause of death?

359
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,440
<22-7,Foreman>还没有验尸
<22-7,Foreman>Autopsy hasn't been performed yet.

360
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,030
<22-7,Foreman>急救人员把他送去了总医院
<22-7,Foreman>EMTs brought him to general,

361
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:39,810
<22-7,Foreman>但是我要求他们把他送回 我们的停尸房方便尸检
<22-7,Foreman>But I requested they ship him back To our morgue for the postmortem.

362
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:43,420
<22-8,House>很好
<22-8,House>Good.

363
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,310
<23-1,Chase>嘿  醒醒
<23-1,Chase>Hon. Wake up.

364
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,330
<23-2,Cameron>你穿着衣服干嘛
<23-2,Cameron>Why are you dressed?

365
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,770
<23-2,Cameron>你还没睡
<23-2,Cameron>You haven't sleep?

366
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:58,130
<23-3,Chase>我想去告诉谢丽尔  唐尼的死讯
<23-3,Chase>I want to go tell Cheryl that Donny died.

367
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,280
<23-4,Cameron>现在是凌晨四点
<23-4,Cameron>It's 4:00 in the morning.

368
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,830
<23-5,Chase>路上要花两个小时
<23-5,Chase>They're nearly two hours away.

369
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:05,040
<23-5,Chase>我到那的时候她就该起来了
<23-5,Chase>I figure by the time I get there, she'll be awake.

370
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:06,480
<23-6,Cameron>亲爱的  回到床上来
<23-6,Cameron>Babe, come back to bed.

371
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:08,040
<23-6,Cameron>过会打电话给她
<23-6,Cameron>Call her in a few hours.

372
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:11,980
<23-7,Chase>这种事要当面说
<23-7,Chase>It's the sort of thing she needs to hear face-to-face.

373
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:20,510
<23-8,Cameron>你没事吧
<23-8,Cameron>Is everything okay?

374
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:22,760
<23-9,Chase>没事
<23-9,Chase>Everything's fine.

375
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:23,790
<23-9,Chase>怎么了
<23-9,Chase>Why?

376
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:27,670
<23-10,Cameron>上周我明白你因为迪巴拉的听证会
<23-10,Cameron>Last week, I understood that you were stressed out

377
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:29,040
<23-10,Cameron>精疲力尽  我给你留出平静的空间
<23-10,Cameron>About the Dibala "m" and "m," and I gave you your space.

378
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:32,210
<23-10,Cameron>但是那都过去了 但你还是这样
<23-10,Cameron>But that's over now, and you're still acting...

379
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:36,630
<23-10,Cameron>我很担心你
<23-10,Cameron>I'm worried about you.

380
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:39,260
<23-11,Chase>别这样
<23-11,Chase>Don't be.

381
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:40,880
<23-11,Chase>我没事
<23-11,Chase>I'm fine.

382
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:43,160
<23-11,Chase>真的
<23-11,Chase>Really.

383
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,620
<23-12,Cameron>如果有什么不对劲  你一定要告诉我
<23-12,Cameron>And you'd tell me if you weren't?

384
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:48,780
<23-12,Cameron>保证
<23-12,Cameron>Promise?

385
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:51,920
<23-13,Chase>我保证
<23-13,Chase>Yeah.

386
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:58,470
<23-14,Cameron>好吧
<23-14,Cameron>Okay.

387
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:00,920
<23-15,Chase>我爱你
<23-15,Chase>I love you.

388
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:03,200
<23-15,Chase>我也爱你
<23-15,Chase>I love you too.

389
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,490
<24-1,Foreman>唐尼·康普森  三十九岁
<24-1,Foreman>Donny Compson, age 39.

390
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:37,330
<25-1,Foreman>我们能直奔主题吗
<25-1,Foreman>Can we cut to the money shot?

391
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,690
<25-2,House>问题在心脏  所以我们看看他的心脏
<25-2,House>It's his heart, so let's look at his heart.

392
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,420
<25-3,Foreman>漂亮的Y形切口
<25-3,Foreman>Nice y-incision.

393
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:46,020
<25-1,Foreman>没有行医执照不能尸检
<25-1,Foreman>You can't perform an autopsy without a medical license.

394
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,050
<25-1,Foreman>真的吗
<25-1,Foreman>Really?

395
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,660
<25-2,House>我认为我已经搞砸了
<25-2,House>'Cause I don't think there's anything I could screw up

396
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:51,290
<25-2,House>所有事了
<25-2,House>That we haven't already screwed up.

397
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,120
<25-3,Foreman>开胸尸检
<25-3,Foreman>Opening postmortem incision.

398
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,030
<25-3,Foreman>从胸骨中线开始
<25-3,Foreman>Beginning at the midline of the sternum.

399
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,930
<25-4,Foreman>很奇怪
<25-4,Foreman>That's odd.

400
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:17,190
<25-4,Foreman>这看上去像
<25-4,Foreman>It almost looks like he's...

401
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,250
<25-4,Foreman>他在流血
<25-4,Foreman>Bleeding.

402
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,970
<25-5,House>我觉得尸检有必要停一下
<25-5,House>I think the autopsy's gonna have to wait a little bit.

403
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:41,330
<26-1,Foreman>他短暂恢复知觉
<26-1,Foreman>He was briefly conscious,

404
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:43,140
<26-1,Foreman>然后收缩压下降到60
<26-1,Foreman>Then his systolic dipped below 60,

405
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:43,910
<26-1,Foreman>然后又昏过去了
<26-1,Foreman>And he was out again.

406
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:46,290
<26-2,House>关于复活的鉴别诊断
<26-2,House>Differential diagnosis for resurrection.

407
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:47,740
<26-3,Foreman>-开始  -很明显他没死
<26-3,Foreman>- Go.  - Obviously he wasn't dead.

408
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,600
<26-3,Foreman>他的心跳低到了急救员观察不到的速率
<26-3,Foreman>His heart slowed enough that the EMTs--

409
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:52,810
<26-4,House>他没死证明我们所做的完全没有错
<26-4,House>Yes, the fact that he's not dead means we did absolutely nothing wrong.

410
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:53,990
<26-5,Cameron>有几个案例证明
<26-5,Cameron>There's several documented cases

411
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:56,520
<26-5,Cameron>河豚毒素摄入会导致假死
<26-5,Cameron>Where tetrodotoxin ingestion caused apparent death.

412
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,550
<26-6,Foreman>不是食物的问题  而是自身上有的
<26-6,Foreman>It wasn't something he ate. It's something he already had.

413
00:22:58,550 --> 00:22:59,300
<26-7,Chase>他的父亲
<26-7,Chase>And his dad,

414
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,730
<26-7,Chase>-祖父还有  -心跳缓慢
<26-7,Chase>- And his grandpa, and...  - Extreme bradycardia

415
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:03,560
<26-8,Foreman>可能导致病态窦房结综合征
<26-8,Foreman>Could be caused by sick sinus syndrome.

416
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,100
<26-9,Chase>-窦房阻塞  -如果问题不在心脏呢
<26-9,Chase>- Sinoatrial block.  - What if it's not his heart?

417
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,590
<26-10,House>让我们从无关紧要的假设开始
<26-10,House>Let's work from the tenuous assumption

418
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:12,670
<26-10,House>如果我们不是那群花了几天时间
<26-10,House>That we're not idiots

419
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:14,160
<26-10,House>仔细检查他心脏的笨蛋
<26-10,House>Who've spent days examining a heart

420
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:15,800
<26-10,House>并且继续错下去 在他心脏罢工前几小时
<26-10,House>Up, down, sideways-- Declaring it healthy just a few hours

421
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,290
<26-10,House>还宣布它的健康
<26-10,House>Before it basically shut down.

422
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:20,380
<26-10,House>那么我们要考虑一些过去没注意到的地方
<26-10,House>So we need to think about causes in places you didn't look.

423
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:24,220
<26-11,Chase>可能是新陈代谢的问题
<26-11,Chase>Could be metabolic.

424
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,600
<26-12,House>你没事吧
<26-12,House>You okay?

425
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,740
<26-12,House>没事
<26-12,House>Yeah.

426
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:35,170
<26-13,Foreman>是不是遗传性 自身免疫病
<26-13,Foreman>What about a genetic predisposition To an autoimmune disease?

427
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:36,810
<26-13,Foreman>相关抗体
<26-13,Foreman>Isolated anti-ro antibody

428
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:37,980
<26-13,Foreman>可能导致完全性心脏阻滞
<26-13,Foreman>Could cause complete heart block.

429
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,750
<26-14,Cameron>而且可以遗传四代
<26-14,Cameron>Could also be passed through four generations.

430
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:40,800
<26-15,House>自体免疫症
<26-15,House>Autoimmune it is.

431
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,220
<26-15,House>给他用类固醇
<26-15,House>Start him on steroids.

432
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:50,580
<27-1,Cameron>感觉怎么样了
<27-1,Cameron>Hey. How you feeling?

433
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,760
<27-2,Donny>头疼的要命
<27-2,Donny>My whole head is killing me.

434
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:56,550
<27-3,Cameron>你刚从重度昏迷中醒过来
<27-3,Cameron>You just came through a severe trauma.

435
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:58,820
<27-3,Cameron>你记得什么么吗
<27-3,Cameron>What do you remember?

436
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,550
<27-4,Donny>我正在把我的衣服放到干衣机里
<27-4,Donny>I was changing my laundry over to the dryer.

437
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:08,410
<27-4,Donny>没有别的吗
<27-4,Donny>That's it?

438
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,840
<27-5,Cameron>你被宣布死亡了
<27-5,Cameron>You were declared dead.

439
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:11,550
<27-5,Cameron>你都被送去尸检了
<27-5,Cameron>You made it all the way to autopsy.

440
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,640
<27-5,Cameron>我的下巴很疼
<27-5,Cameron>My jaw aches.

441
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:19,210
<27-6,Donny>而且我没有奥尔托利综合症
<27-6,Donny>And obviously I don't have Ortoli syndrome.

442
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,060
<27-6,Donny>从鬼门关被拉回来 没什么可兴奋的
<27-6,Donny>It's hard to get too excited about coming back from the dead

443
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,810
<27-6,Donny>不管我怎么做  不管你给我什么
<27-6,Donny>When anything I do, anything you give me--

444
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:26,110
<27-6,Donny>结果都是一样的
<27-6,Donny>It all ends the same way.

445
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,020
<28-1,Ayala>外耳和中耳反应正常
<28-1,Ayala>Outer and middle ear respond well.

446
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,230
<28-1,Ayala>听觉阈频率正常
<28-1,Ayala>Hearing thresholds are normal at all frequencies.

447
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:47,430
<28-1,Ayala>耳膜完全健康
<28-1,Ayala>Eardrum is perfectly healthy.

448
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:48,360
<28-2,House>如果我
<28-2,House>What if I, uh...

449
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:51,620
<28-2,House>如果有时候我听到有人在窃窃私语呢
<28-2,House>If I sometimes hear whispering?

450
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,380
<28-3,Ayala>那可能的确有人在窃窃私语
<28-3,Ayala>Then you're probably hearing someone whispering.

451
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:58,280
<28-4,House>我小的时候在菲律宾 整过牙
<28-4,House>I had some dental work done in the Philippines when I was a kid.

452
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,060
<28-4,House>里面的金属填充物可能会腐蚀
<28-4,House>Adjoining metal fillings could corrode

453
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,420
<28-4,House>从而收听到调幅广播
<28-4,House>And pick up a.m. Radio signals.

454
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:02,430
<28-5,Ayala>张嘴
<28-5,Ayala>Open your mouth.

455
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,550
<28-5,Ayala>你的填充物没问题
<28-5,Ayala>Your fillings don't touch.

456
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,700
<28-6,House>所以没有理由能解释我听到那些声音
<28-6,House>So there's no reason for me to be hearing things.

457
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,820
<28-7,Ayala>我只能说 你听觉健康
<28-7,Ayala>I can only tell you that you're hearing sounds as you should.

458
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:14,380
<28-7,Ayala>如果你也能听见不该听见的声音
<28-7,Ayala>If you're also hearing sounds that you shouldn't,

459
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,540
<28-7,Ayala>那就是精神问题
<28-7,Ayala>Well, that would be psychosis.

460
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,240
<28-7,Ayala>你只能跟脑科的人谈
<28-7,Ayala>You'd have to talk to someone who does brain.

461
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,410
<28-7,Ayala>我只负责耳科
<28-7,Ayala>I only do ears.

462
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,860
<29-1,Cuddy>神人
<29-1,Cuddy>Bravo!

463
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:32,590
<29-1,Cuddy>一天内你完成了120个小时工作  真神奇
<29-1,Cuddy>It's amazing how you did 120 hours in one day.

464
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:35,050
<29-2,House>我状态不好
<29-2,House>I wasn't on my best behavior.

465
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:35,830
<29-2,House>我承认
<29-2,House>I admit.

466
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:37,060
<29-2,House>请允许我
<29-2,House>Allow me.

467
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:41,280
<29-3,Cuddy>从现在开始  我会监督由你指导的实践课
<29-3,Cuddy>From now on, I'm gonna supervise your practicum requirements.

468
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,310
<29-4,House>没这个必要了
<29-4,House>That won't be necessary.

469
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:44,190
<29-5,Cuddy>你想再惹怒另一个医生吗
<29-5,Cuddy>You want to annoy another doctor first?

470
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:45,820
<29-6,House>-最终  -真的没必要
<29-6,House>- Eventually  - It's not necessary,

471
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,120
<29-6,House>因为我还没准备好继续当医生
<29-6,House>Because I'm not ready to be a doctor again.

472
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:52,330
<29-6,House>很抱歉
<29-6,House>I'm sorry.

473
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,320
<30-1,Wilson>你要在外面睡吗
<30-1,Wilson>Are you sleeping out here?

474
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:16,770
<30-2,House>只是  看着电视就睡着了
<30-2,House>Just...dozed off in front of the TV.

475
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:17,730
<30-3,Wilson>需要连床都铺上
<30-3,Wilson>With bedding?

476
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:18,460
<30-4,House>也许
<30-4,House>Maybe!

477
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,480
<30-4,House>我不能睡里面
<30-4,House>I can't sleep in there.

478
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,520
<30-4,House>暖气糟透了
<30-4,House>The heater's screwed up.

479
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:25,160
<30-5,Wilson>如果你需要找人聊聊
<30-5,Wilson>If you need to talk...

480
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:26,390
<30-5,Wilson>如果  如果你需要帮助
<30-5,Wilson>If--if you need more help--

481
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:27,860
<30-6,House>我只是累了
<30-6,House>I'm just tired.

482
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,050
<30-7,Wilson>我就在这里
<30-7,Wilson>I'm right here.

483
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:31,320
<30-7,Wilson>很好

484
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:33,460
<30-8,House>你能"就在"别的地方吗
<30-8,House>Can you be right here somewhere else?

485
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,180
<31-1,Donny>我下巴还是痛
<31-1,Donny>My jaw still hurts.

486
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,730
<31-1,Donny>我牙齿  真的  非常地痛
<31-1,Donny>My tooth-- Actually, a lot.

487
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:46,910
<31-2,Nurse>很抱歉  你的止痛药用量已经达到上限了
<31-2,Nurse>I'm sorry, you're maxed out on your pain meds.

488
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:47,880
<31-2,Nurse>睡一觉吧
<31-2,Nurse>Try to sleep.

489
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:15,820
<31-2,Nurse>牙医检查了被这个人拔出的牙齿
<31-2,Nurse>Dentist looked at the tooth the guy pulled out.

490
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:17,040
<32-1,Chase>没有发现什么问题
<32-1,Chase>There was nothing wrong with it.

491
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:19,570
<32-2,Foreman>那除了发现他是个傻子以外
<32-2,Foreman>So aside from him being an idiot,

492
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:20,490
<32-2,Foreman>我们还有什么发现
<32-2,Foreman>What else have we learned?

493
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,460
<32-3,Cameron>疼痛是真实的  肯定来自于身体的某个部位
<32-3,Cameron>The pain is real. It's coming from somewhere.

494
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,690
<32-3,Cameron>会不会是骨癌
<32-3,Cameron>What about bone cancer?

495
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,920
<32-4,Chase>你没法把骨癌和心脏问题联系起来
<32-4,Chase>You can't connect bone cancer to the heart.

496
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,830
<32-4,Chase>豪斯觉得可以这件事等到早上再解决
<32-4,Chase>House figure this can wait till the morning?

497
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:31,510
<32-5,Foreman>事实上  他告诉卡迪他还没有准备好来工作
<32-5,Foreman>Actually, he told Cuddy he's not ready to work.

498
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,700
<32-6,Cameron>他辞职了
<32-6,Cameron>He quit?

499
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:35,150
<32-8,Chase>-很显然  -这不过是豪斯的高压攻势
<32-8,Chase>- Apparently. - It's a power play.

500
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:36,240
<32-8,Chase>他明天就会回来了
<32-8,Chase>He'll be back tomorrow.

501
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:39,420
<32-9,Foreman>骨癌可以引发副肿瘤综合症
<32-9,Foreman>Bone cancer could trigger a paraneoplastic syndrome,

502
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,580
<32-9,Foreman>导致心房关闭
<32-9,Foreman>Which shuts down the heart.

503
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:43,020
<32-10,Chase>原发性骨癌是非遗传性的
<32-10,Chase>Primary bone cancer isn't hereditary.

504
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,270
<32-11,Cameron>李弗劳明综合征
<32-11,Cameron>Li-fraumeni syndrome.

505
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,690
<32-11,Cameron>它是遗传的  而且会增加
<32-11,Cameron>It's hereditary, and it increases

506
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,540
<32-11,Cameron>得骨癌的可能性
<32-11,Cameron>A person's risk of having bone cancer.

507
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,790
<32-11,Cameron>你有别的理论吗
<32-11,Cameron>You have another theory?

508
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:54,430
<32-12,Chase>我的理论是这不是骨癌
<32-12,Chase>My theory is it's not bone cancer.

509
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:57,330
<32-13,Foreman>伽玛测量能确定肿瘤的所在地
<32-13,Foreman>Gamma survey would locate the tumors.

510
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:15,940
<33-1,Wilson>我今天喝了浓豌豆汤
<33-1,Wilson>I had pea soup today.

511
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:18,970
<33-1,Wilson>你现在肯定会喜欢上我的气息
<33-1,Wilson>You'd love my breath right now.

512
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,920
<33-1,Wilson>我今天晚上没能跑步
<33-1,Wilson>I didn't get a chance to run tonight.

513
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:24,120
<33-1,Wilson>豪斯他  他出了点问题
<33-1,Wilson>House is... Is having issues.

00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:27,870
<33-1,Wilson>我今天很想你
<33-1,Wilson>I missed you a lot today.

515
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:31,260
<33-1,Wilson>我最想做的就是
<33-1,Wilson>All I want to do is...

516
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:35,800
<33-1,Wilson>你知道的

<34-1,Cameron>外侧楔骨没有发现癌
<34-1,Cameron>No cancers on the lateral cuneiform bone.

00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,650
<34-2,Foreman>舟骨也没有发现异样
<34-2,Foreman>Navicular's also clean.

519
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:48,010
<34-3,Cameron>奇斯对我撒谎了
<34-3,Cameron>Chase is lying to me.

520
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:50,620
<34-3,Cameron>我知道你清楚真相
<34-3,Cameron>And I know you know.

521
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:52,160
<34-3,Cameron>告诉我到底怎么回事  求你了
<34-3,Cameron>Tell me what's going on, please.

522
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,070
<34-4,Foreman>我只能把跟他讲的再跟你说一遍
<34-4,Foreman>I'm gonna tell you the same thing I told him...

523
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:55,540
<34-4,Foreman>去跟你的配偶谈谈
<34-4,Foreman>Talk to your spouse.

524
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:04,230
<35-1,Wilson>不吃早饭吗
<35-1,Wilson>No breakfast?

525
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,210
<35-2,House>今天不吃
<35-2,House>Not today.

526
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:08,790
<35-2,House>我产生幻觉了
<35-2,House>I'm hallucinating.

527
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,380
<35-3,Wilson>发生了什么事
<35-3,Wilson>What happened?

528
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:15,150
<35-4,House>这次不是视觉上的
<35-4,House>It's nothing visual this time.

529
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:17,940
<35-4,House>我能听见有人在窃窃私语
<35-4,House>I hear whispering.

530
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,620
<35-5,Wilson>这就是你奇怪举止的原因
<35-5,Wilson>Is that why you've been acting so weird?

531
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,500
<35-5,Wilson>-也是你辞职的原因吗  -我在变严重
<35-5,Wilson>- Is that why you quit? - I'm losing it.

532
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:25,340
<35-7,Wilson>我相信肯定会有个合理解释的
<35-7,Wilson>I'm sure there's a rational explanation.

533
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:25,990
<35-7,Wilson>是不是风声
<35-7,Wilson>The wind?

534
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,190
<35-7,Wilson>-或者是邻居家的电视  -我都检查过了
<35-7,Wilson>- A neighbor's TV?  - I checked everything.

535
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:30,310
<35-8,House>真正可怕的是我在不服用维科丁的情况下
<35-8,House>What's really scary is that I hear whispering

536
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:31,750
<35-8,House>还能听见有人在耳语
<35-8,House>While not on vicodin.

537
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:36,810
<35-8,House>我要重返梅菲尔德好好检查下自己
<35-8,House>I'm gonna check myself back into Mayfield.

539
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,750
<35-9,Wilson>你说好吧
<35-9,Wilson>Okay?

540
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:49,570
<35-10,House>你不觉得会有一个更合理的解释吗
<35-10,House>You don't think there might be a logical explanation?

541
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:50,550
<35-10,House>我漏掉的
<35-10,House>Something I missed?

<35-11,Wilson>你是我认识的最聪明的人

<35-11,Wilson>如果你都没弄明白  那就根本不存在
<35-11,Wilson>If you haven't thought of it, it doesn't exist.

00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:55,850
<35-11,Wilson>我会开车送你去
<35-11,Wilson>I'll drive you over.

545
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:57,780
<35-11,Wilson>不过我要先泡杯茶
<35-11,Wilson>I just need to make some tea first.

548
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,840
<35-13,Wilson>你偷听我和过世的女友讲话
<35-13,Wilson>You overheard me talking to my dead girlfriend

549
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,200
<35-13,Wilson>还自我陶醉说
<35-13,Wilson>And thought to yourself, "hmm...

550
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:12,100
<35-13,Wilson>"我该怎么从中获得乐趣呢"
<35-13,Wilson>What kind of fun can I have with this?"

551
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,390
<35-14,House>你干嘛要跟她讲话
<35-14,House>Why are you talking to her?

<35-14,House>你身边的大活人都失踪了
<35-14,House>You run out of living people?

<36-10,House>Are you sure you're only one woman?

572
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:02,800
<36-11,Cuddy>这是一个你扮演雇员 我扮演老板的地方
<36-11,Cuddy>This is the part where You play the employee, and I play the boss.

<37-4,House>Did I come in too soon?

584
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:33,080
<37-4,House>好吧  我再出去转一圈
<37-4,House>Okay, I'm gonna take another lap.

585
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,730
<37-4,House>等我回来的时候我要听到三个新点子
<37-4,House>And I want three new ideas by the time I come back.

586
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:37,480
<37-4,House>得有一个不蠢的
<37-4,House>One of them's got to be not stupid.

587
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:45,340
<37-4,House>有痛感的地方  就有神经
<37-4,House>Where there's pain... There's nerves.

588
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:49,730
<37-4,House>自发性遗传感受神经病   第一类
<37-4,House>Hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathy, type one.

589
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,520
<37-5,Foreman>脑干中的信息传达
<37-5,Foreman>Miscommunication in the brain stem

590
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,170
<37-5,Foreman>把神经痛错判为牙痛
<37-5,Foreman>Mistakes nerve pain for tooth pain.

591
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:54,370
<37-6,Cameron>这也能解释心动过缓
<37-6,Cameron>It would explain the bradycardia too.

592
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:56,300
<37-7,House>我想加上"遗传性"这个词
<37-7,House>And I like the word "hereditary" in the title.

593
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,770
<37-8,Foreman>立痛定[镇痛药]可以治好他
<37-8,Foreman>Carbamazepine fixes him.

594
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,330
<37-9,Cameron>我马上去准备药
<37-9,Cameron>I'll get him started on the medication.

595
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:02,530
<37-10,House>不需要  奇斯特别问过他能不能由他处理
<37-10,House>Nope, Chase specifically asked if he could do it.

596
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:10,140
<38-1,House>在家里睡大觉
<38-1,House>Sleep at home.

597
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:13,170
<38-2,Chase>这样我就不用做伽玛测量了
<38-2,Chase>So I didn't do the gamma survey.

598
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:15,460
<38-2,Chase>-是不是骨癌  -不是
<38-2,Chase>- Is it bone cancer?  - No.

599
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,460
<38-4,Chase>你得感谢我没有浪费你的时间
<38-4,Chase>You should congratulate me for not wasting your time.

600
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,880
<38-5,House>你想不想得到帮助
<38-5,House>Are you getting some help?

601
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:21,510
<38-5,House>或者说从现在起你就随遇而安了
<38-5,House>Or is this the way things are gonna be from now on?

602
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:24,990
<38-5,House>可悲的是你还没得到帮助
<38-5,House>What's pathetic is you haven't gotten help

603
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:27,580
<38-5,House>因为你想让自己不舒服
<38-5,House>Because you want to feel bad.

604
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:28,990
<38-5,House>你想变得痛苦
<38-5,House>You want to suffer,

605
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,990
<38-5,House>因为如果你内疚  就自认为不是个神经病
<38-5,House>'Cause if you feel guilty, then you're not a psychopath.

606
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:34,510
<38-5,House>病人需要立痛定
<38-5,House>Patient needs some carbamazepine.

607
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:36,850
<38-5,House>我不管那个房间有多吓人
<38-5,House>Now, I don't care how much that room scares you,

608
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:39,210
<38-5,House>你得去工作
<38-5,House>You're doing your job.

609
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:56,540
<39-1,Donny>离你从单子上划掉这个可能性 还要多长时间
<39-1,Donny>How long before you cross This one off the list?

610
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,320
<39-2,Chase>几个小时
<39-2,Chase>A couple of hours.

611
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:05,940
<39-2,Chase>你朝别人开过枪吗
<39-2,Chase>You ever shoot anyone?

612
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:07,740
<39-3,Donny>开过两次
<39-3,Donny>Twice.

613
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:10,150
<39-4,Chase>你杀过人吗
<39-4,Chase>You ever kill anyone?

614
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,230
<39-4,Chase>没有
<39-4,Chase>No.

615
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:14,260
<39-5,Donny>我倒是知道有人做过
<39-5,Donny>I know a few guys who did, though.

616
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,330
<39-6,Chase>他们能心安吗
<39-6,Chase>Did they ever get over it?

617
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:19,140
<39-7,Donny>我认识的一个上尉把这个比喻成清除垃圾
<39-7,Donny>A captain I know compares it to taking out the trash,

618
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:20,310
<39-7,Donny>根本不当一回事
<39-7,Donny>Like it's nothing.

619
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,110
<39-7,Donny>可是我之前有个拍档
<39-7,Donny>Other hand, I got an ex-partner

620
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,980
<39-7,Donny>把自己灌得烂醉如泥
<39-7,Donny>Who nearly drank himself into oblivion.

621
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:27,560
<39-8,Chase>他有寻求帮助吗
<39-8,Chase>Did he get help?

622
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:28,690
<39-8,Chase>有的
<39-8,Chase>Yeah.

623
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:30,980
<39-9,Donny>可是没有用
<39-9,Donny>Help didn't help.

624
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:38,480
<39-9,Donny>噢  天啊
<39-9,Donny>Oh, god!

625
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:39,900
<39-10,Chase>怎么了
<39-10,Chase>What is it?

626
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:42,180
<39-11,Donny>我失禁了
<39-11,Donny>I went to the bathroom.

627
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,400
<40-1,Chase>病人失禁
<40-1,Chase>Patient's lost bowel control.

628
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,190
<40-1,Chase>证明不是遗传性感觉自主神经病变
<40-1,Chase>Means we were wrong about h-san,

629
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,990
<40-1,Chase>并且他的病情在恶化
<40-1,Chase>And it means he's getting worse fast.

630
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:56,730
<40-2,House>没人想做他的
<40-2,House>Wouldn't want to be the duty nurse

631
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:57,880
<40-2,House>值班护士  明白吗
<40-2,House>Assigned to his floor. Get it?

632
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,110
<40-2,House>大便护士
<40-2,House>"Doody" nurse?

633
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,510
<40-2,House>好吧  回到医学上来
<40-2,House>Fine. Do the doctor thing.

634
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:03,100
<40-3,Chase>自体免疫絮乱可以解释
<40-3,Chase>An autoimmune disorder could explain--

635
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,610
<40-4,Foreman>我们给他用过类固醇  他没有反应
<40-4,Foreman>We put him on steroids. He didn't respond.

636
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:06,530
<40-5,Cameron>不是自体免疫的问题  可能是肝豆状核变性
<40-5,Cameron>It's not autoimmune. Could be Wilson's disease.

637
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:08,390
<40-6,House>这个病事先就会对肝脏造成影响
<40-6,House>A disease that advanced would've hit the liver.

638
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:10,480
<40-7,Foreman>可能是肝脏已经出现异常
<40-7,Foreman>It is possible the liver's so far gone,

639
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,750
<40-7,Foreman>化验数据没有体现出来
<40-7,Foreman>The labs look normal.

640
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,900
<40-7,Foreman>值得一试
<40-7,Foreman>It's worth a shot.

641
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:16,610
<40-8,House>给他用青霉胺
<40-8,House>Go treat with penicillamine.

642
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:19,620
<40-8,House>如果没有好转  马上回来
<40-8,House>And when he doesn't get better, come back quickly,

643
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:21,350
<40-8,House>好让我们讨论其他治疗方法
<40-8,House>So we can get one more shot at it.

644
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,960
<41-1,Chase>求主宽恕  我有罪
<41-1,Chase>Bless me, father, for I have sinned.

645
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,140
<41-2,Priest>请慢慢道来
<41-2,Priest>Take your time.

646
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:40,960
<41-2,Priest>你多久没来忏悔了
<41-2,Priest>How long has it been since your last confession?

647
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,090
<41-3,Chase>我杀了人
<41-3,Chase>I killed a man.

648
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:47,020
<41-5,Chase>可是我是对的
<41-5,Chase>But it was the right thing to do.

649
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:52,710
<41-6,Priest>他人的生死权不是掌握在你手里
<41-6,Priest>Who lives or dies is not your decision to make.

650
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:55,950
<41-7,Chase>但在手术室里就是这样的
<41-7,Chase>Sometimes in the operating room it feels like it.

651
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,290
<41-7,Chase>我是个医生
<41-7,Chase>I'm a doctor.

652
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:01,590
<41-8,Priest>那样你应该比任何人都清楚
<41-8,Priest>Well, then you should know more than anybody

653
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:04,530
<41-8,Priest>每个生命都是神圣的
<41-8,Priest>That every human life is sacred.

654
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:06,490
<42-2,House>为什么
<42-2,House>Why?

655
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:09,650
<41-9,Chase>告诉我  一个杀害千百人命的独裁者
<41-9,Chase>Tell me what's sacred about a dictator

656
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:12,860
<41-9,Chase>他的生命能有多神圣
<41-9,Chase>That kills hundreds of thousands of his own people.

657
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:15,670
<41-10,Priest>那一个杀死他病人的医生又能有多神圣呢
<41-10,Priest>What is sacred about a doctor who kills a patient?

658
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:22,970
<41-11,Chase>你担心宽恕我是错误的吗
<41-11,Chase>Is it just the slippery slope you're worried about?

659
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:25,630
<41-11,Chase>害怕宽恕一个杀了坏人的我
<41-11,Chase>Afraid that forgiving me

660
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:28,360
<41-11,Chase>哪怕杀的是世界上最坏的人  一个独裁者
<41-11,Chase>For killing the worst people on earth such a bad president?

661
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,510
<41-11,Chase>我保证
<41-11,Chase>I promise...

662
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:32,750
<41-11,Chase>我不会告诉任何人
<41-11,Chase>I won't tell anyone.

663
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:41,040
<41-11,Chase>请宽恕我吧
<41-11,Chase>Just forgive me.

664
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:45,770
<41-12,Priest>我为你欢呼10次也减轻不了你的罪
<41-12,Priest>Saying ten hail isn't going to do you any good.

665
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:48,030
<41-13,Chase>那我能做什么
<41-13,Chase>Then what do I have to do?

666
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:52,500
<41-13,Chase>上帝要我做什么
<41-13,Chase>What does god need me to do?

667
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,280
<41-14,Priest>你不能得到赦免
<41-14,Priest>You can't have absolution

668
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,620
<41-14,Priest>直到你承担你的责任
<41-14,Priest>Without first taking responsibility.

669
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,280
<41-14,Priest>你需要向警方自首
<41-14,Priest>You have to turn yourself into the police.

670
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:00,330
<41-14,Priest>什么
<41-14,Priest>What...

671
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,830
<41-15,Chase>然后在监狱里度过余生吗
<41-15,Chase>And go to jail for the rest of my life?

672
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:04,800
<41-15,Chase>公理何在
<41-15,Chase>What's just about that?

673
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:10,200
<41-15,Chase>我做的是对的
<41-15,Chase>I did the right thing.

674
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,290
<41-15,Chase>一定有别的方法
<41-15,Chase>There has to be another way.

675
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:15,810
<41-16,Priest>你想得到赦免  我已经告诉你怎么做了
<41-16,Priest>You want absolution, I've told you how to get it.

676
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:40,890
<42-1,Cuddy>把这个寄到州执照委员会
<42-1,Cuddy>Send this in to the state licensing board.

677
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:42,710
<42-1,Cuddy>我已经给你签字了
<42-1,Cuddy>I've signed off on all your hours.

678
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:45,060
<42-2,House>为什么
<42-2,House>Why?

679
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,460
<42-3,Cuddy>因为这是比较容易的解决方法
<42-3,Cuddy>Because it's easier this way.

680
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:48,680
<42-4,House>你对我不爽
<42-4,House>You're uncomfortable with me.

681
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,310
<42-4,House>我没有
<42-4,House>No.

682
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,870
<42-5,Cuddy>没必要照章办事
<42-5,Cuddy>Going by the book was pointless.

683
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:54,060
<42-5,Cuddy>你从中得不到任何长进
<42-5,Cuddy>You were gonna learn nothing.

684
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:56,290
<42-6,House>好  我还以为是因为性紧张
<42-6,House>Good, I thought it was because of the sexual tension.

685
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:57,500
<42-7,Cuddy>不是什么性紧张
<42-7,Cuddy>There was no sexual tension.

686
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,620
<42-8,House>是紧张
<42-8,House>There was tension.

687
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:01,930
<42-8,House>而且  它让我觉得妙趣横生
<42-8,House>And...it made me feel funny, so...

688
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:03,680
<42-9,Cuddy>给
<42-9,Cuddy>Here.

689
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,500
<42-10,House>太糟了
<42-10,House>That's too bad.

690
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:12,080
<42-10,House>我刚开始喜欢 做这种热血老师
<42-10,House>I was kind of getting into the whole Hot-for-teacher thing.

691
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:14,710
<42-11,Cuddy>你确定你没事吗
<42-11,Cuddy>You sure you're okay?

692
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:17,970
<42-12,House>是的  错误警报
<42-12,House>Yeah. False alarm.

693
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:21,750
<42-12,House>我们呢
<42-12,House>What about us?

694
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:23,990
<42-13,Cuddy>像这样
<42-13,Cuddy>We're good...

695
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:25,430
<42-13,Cuddy>就很好了
<42-13,Cuddy>Just like this.

696
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:26,910
<42-13,Cuddy>你按我的按钮  我按你的[互相帮忙]
<42-13,Cuddy>You press my buttons, I press yours.

697
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:28,390
<42-14,House>你说的按钮是指
<42-14,House>By buttons, you mean...

698
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,720
<42-14,House>你的确让我妙趣横生
<42-14,House>You do make me feel funny.

699
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:54,300
<43-1,House>你不会死的
<43-1,House>You're not gonna die.

700
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:56,520
<43-2,Donny>我已经接受这个事实了

<43-3,House>除了高足弓
<43-3,House>In addition to high arches

703
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,260
<43-3,House>还有一些吞拿鱼形的玻璃碗
<43-3,House>And some crystal bowl in the shape of a tuna,

<43-3,House>It forms in the brain stem.

706
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:12,550
<43-3,House>准确的讲  它是个动脉瘤

<43-3,House>它随着你的年龄长大
<43-3,House>As you get older, it gets bigger,

710

713
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:25,060
<43-3,House>那是我一个高中朋友的花名
<43-3,House>'Cause I had a friend in high school with that name--

<43-4,Donny>说我很健康只是为了让我好受点
<43-4,Donny>Saying I'm healthy just to make me feel better?

718
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,990
<43-5,House>听起来确实是那样的
<43-5,House>It does sound that way, doesn't it?

<43-5,House>可是这次  不是安慰剂
<43-5,House>But this time, no sugar pills.

<43-5,House>我将会切进你的脑 让你觉得我在医治它
<43-5,House>I'm gonna cut into your brain To make you think that I'm fixing it.

<43-5,House>我还会给你儿子动手术

<43-6,Donny>迈克尔会没事吗
<43-6,Donny>Michael's gonna be okay?

725
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:54,450
<43-7,House>除非他从这里出去的时候被车撞死
<43-7,House>Unless he walks out of here and gets run over by a bus,

726
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:56,800
<43-7,House>那样的话  我会重新考虑你的因果论
<43-7,House>In which case, I will reconsider your fate argument.
