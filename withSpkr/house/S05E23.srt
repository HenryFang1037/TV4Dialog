120
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:09,960
<8-4,House>那么没用

121
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:13,170
<8-5,Amber>下一个你准备说是什么病?
<8-5,Amber>So what's next on yourabclist of things it's not?

122
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:16,300
<8-6,Foreman>病人对抗生素没反应 仍然无法呼吸
<8-6,Foreman>Patient's not responding to theabcantibiotics. Still can't breathe.

123
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:18,200
<8-7,House>那么做个检查 确认是肺炎
<8-7,House>So run a test to confirm it's pneumonia.

124
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:20,700
<8-8,Foreman>我们没办法做支气管镜abc她的肺还在塌陷
<8-8,Foreman>We can't do a bronc becauseabcher lungs are still collapsed.

125
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,060
<8-9,House>经气管穿刺抽取
<8-9,House>Transtracheal aspiration.

126
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,690
<8-10,Foreman>那基本上就是水刑
<8-10,Foreman>That's basically waterboarding.

127
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:28,030
<8-12,Amber>- 这很激进abc- 这是个好主意
<8-12,Amber>- It is pretty radical.abc- It's a great idea.

128
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:32,810
<8-13,House>普通激进 House式激进 还是超House式?
<8-13,House>Regular radical,me radical,orabcme out of my mind radical?

129
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:35,920
<8-14,Wilson>介于普通和House式之间
<8-14,Wilson>Somewhere between regular and you.

130
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:37,870
<8-15,House>那有什么问题?
<8-15,House>So what's the problem?

131
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,210
<8-16,Foreman>一切都好吧?
<8-16,Foreman>Everything okay?

132
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:43,390
<8-17,House>不好 我们的病人无法呼吸
<8-17,House>No. Our patient can't breathe.

133
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,240
<8-17,House>去做检查 或者想个更好的主意
<8-17,House>Either do the test orabccome up with a better one.

134
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:58,270
<8-17,House>我们把范围缩小到感染 外伤abc多发性硬化症 精神分裂症和药物
<8-17,House>So we're down toabcinfection,trauma,M.S.,Schizophrenia,or pills.

135
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,650
<8-18,Wilson>精神分裂症通常在年轻时就会显现
<8-18,Wilson>Schizophrenia usually manifests younger.

136
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,520
<8-19,House>这就是把它列在单子下方的原因
<8-19,House>That's why it's further down the list.

137
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:06,550
<8-19,House>一个简单的血液测试abc就可以确认是否是感染
<8-19,House>I can confirm an infection withabca simple blood test.

138
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:08,950
<8-20,Amber>感染可以治疗的...治愈的
<8-20,Amber>An infection can be treated... cured.

139
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:12,700
<8-20,Amber>这意味着你还能工作abc意味着你还能活下去
<8-20,Amber>Means you still got a job.abcMeans you still got a life.

140
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:15,810
<8-20,Amber>这不是更接近的猜测abc这是让你比较好过的
<8-20,Amber>It doesn't make it a betterabcidea,just a nicer one.

141
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,670
<8-20,Amber>你真是理性的吗?
<8-20,Amber>This the rational you talking?

142
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,280
<8-21,House>我没办法自己做
<8-21,House>Can't do this on my own.

143
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:29,560
<9-1,Foreman>当我们注入水之后 你会感觉像在溺水
<9-1,Foreman>When we inject the water,it'sabcgonna feel like you're drowning.

144
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:32,240
<9-1,Foreman>但是几秒就好了
<9-1,Foreman>But it'll be over in a few seconds.

145

<9-2,Penelope>- 然后我会好些吗?abc- 好一点
<9-2,Penelope>- Then it'll be better?abc- A little.

146
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,500
<9-4,Foreman>把她的肩膀按下去一些
<9-4,Foreman>Hold her shoulders down a little.

147
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:43,010
<9-4,Foreman>准备好了吗?
<9-4,Foreman>Ready?

148
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:55,380
<9-4,Foreman>你做得很好 我要注入液体了
<9-4,Foreman>You're doing great.abcHere comes the liquid.

151
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,190
<9-7,Taub>她的皮肤脱落了
<9-7,Taub>Her skin came off.

152

<10-1,Foreman>她皮肤脱落的速度abc比我们替换人工皮肤还快
<10-1,Foreman>Her skin is sloughing off faster than weabccan replace it with the artificial skin.

153
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:25,780
<10-2,Thirteen>可能是自体免疫疾病
<10-2,Thirteen>Could be autoimmune.

154
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:27,780
<10-3,Foreman>抗核抗体检查呈阴性
<10-3,Foreman>A.N.A.Was negative.

155
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,550
<10-4,House>注意力集中在肺部
<10-4,House>Focus on the lungs.

156
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:33,090
<10-5,Foreman>你想让我们无视她失去了80%的皮肤?
<10-5,Foreman>You want us to ignore the factabcthat she's lost 80% of her skin?

157
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,720
<10-6,House>我们知道不是肺癌
<10-6,House>We know it's not lung cancer.

158
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:38,000
<10-6,House>可能是肝肿瘤 扩散到了肺部
<10-6,House>Could be a liver tumor,eatsabcthrough to the lungs.

159
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,770
<10-6,House>给她的肝做个超声
<10-6,House>Get an ultrasound of her liver.

160
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:41,610
<10-6,House>如果发现肿瘤 做个活检
<10-6,House>If you find masses,get a biopsy.

161
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,290
<10-7,Foreman>我们不能忽略皮肤的问题
<10-7,Foreman>We can't just ignore the skin.

162
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,530
<10-7,Foreman>这显然是目前最主要 最致命的症状
<10-7,Foreman>It's obviously the most significantabcand dangerous symptom right now.

163
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:48,610
<10-8,House>我不认为这是个症状
<10-8,House>I don't think it is a symptom.

<10-8,House>I think we caused it.

165
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:51,880
<10-9,Thirteen>我们干什么了?

00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,940
<10-10,House>我给她开了抗生素

<10-12,House>Yeah,well,maybe this is the one.

<11-7,House>你没做错什么 只是开了抗生素
<11-7,House>You didn't do anything wrong.abcYou prescribed antibiotics.

177
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:39,320
<11-8,Wilson>换作任何医生都会这么做
<11-8,Wilson>Any other doctor would'veabcdone the exact same thing.

<11-10,House>I have no reason to feel guilty.abcIt doesn't make any sense...

<11-11,Wilson>Guilt as a symptom?

182
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:55,310
<11-12,House>符合多发性硬化症
<11-12,House>It's consistent with M.S.

183
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:00,550
<11-12,House>既然血液检查呈阴性abc我得向病人道歉
<11-12,House>And since the blood tests wereabcnegative,I have to apologize.

<11-12,House>就说明我大脑边缘中招了
<11-12,House>it means my limbic brain is shot.

<11-12,House>我是House医生

<15-2,Thirteen>也许是心脏导致了肺部塌陷
<15-2,Thirteen>Maybe the heart causedabcthe lungs to collapse.

00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:10,550
<15-21,Thirteen>要是重启不了怎么办?
<15-21,Thirteen>What if we cat restart it?

<18-29,Chase>- I don't see anything.abc- I'm restarting her heart.

336
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,150
<18-30,Foreman>这有个阴影 2厘米--
<18-30,Foreman>That's a shadow.abcTwo centimeters--

337
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,080
<19-1,House>你觉得害怕abc因为你知道这会起作用
<19-1,House>You're only scared becauseabcyou know this is gonna work.

338
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:16,510
<19-1,House>超过3分钟了
<19-1,House>We're over three minutes.

339
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:07,270
<19-1,House>来人 拿葡萄糖来!
<19-1,House>I need glucose in here!

340
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:33,220
<19-1,House>你差点就挂了
<19-1,House>You could've died.

341
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:43,690
<19-1,House>奏效了
<19-1,House>It worked.

342
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,690
<23-1,Wilson>我的裤子呢?
<23-1,Wilson>Where are my pants?

343
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,290
<23-2,House>你确定?
<23-2,House>Are you sure?

344
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:52,840
<23-3,Wilson>这些天来 她简直无处不在
<23-3,Wilson>She's been everywhere I've bn for days.

345
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,900
<23-4,House>她不在这 就是说...
<23-4,House>She's not here,ergo...

346
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:57,320
<23-5,Wilson>这办法可够不上理智
<23-5,Wilson>This was not the next rational step.

347
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,420
<23-6,House>到底是谁有成见?
<23-6,House>Now who's being biased?

348
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,500
<23-6,House>你一心想让我戒断abc甚至超过了我--
<23-6,House>You wanted me to detox asabcmuch as I wanted--

349
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:05,260
<23-6,House>我忘记怎么给裤子拉链了
<23-6,House>I forgot how to do my zipper.

350
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:07,320
<23-7,Wilson>有没有别的神经缺损症状?
<23-7,Wilson>Any other neurological deficits?

351
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,820
<23-8,House>你好像没平时那么烦人了
<23-8,House>You don't seem to annoyabcmeas much as usual.

352
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:11,820
<23-8,House>不一定是缺陷
<23-8,House>Not sure that's a deficit.

353
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:15,160
<23-8,House>并且...我好起来了
<23-8,House>And... I'm all better.

354
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:20,520
<23-9,Wilson>- 她真的消失了?abc- 当然
<23-9,Wilson>- Is she really gone?abc- Absolutely.

355
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:24,040
<23-10,House>我能感觉到自己正压抑对冒险的冲动
<23-10,House>I can feel myself repressing allabckinds of ricky things.

356
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:26,630
<23-10,House>我可以走了吧?
<23-10,House>I check out,don't I?

357
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,050
<23-10,House>该死
<23-10,House>Damn.

358
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,720
<24-1,Chase>他什么也没看到 是伪影
<24-1,Chase>He didn't see anything. Heabcsaw an artifact on the monitor.

359
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:43,020
<24-2,Foreman>她心脏上有阴影
<24-2,Foreman>It was a shadow on her heart.

360
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:45,400
<24-3,Chase>她可以说已经死亡了3分钟
<24-3,Chase>She'd already been technicallyabcdead for three minutes.

361
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:49,290
<24-3,Chase>我觉得保证她活着abc比延长成像时间更重要
<24-3,Chase>I thought keeping her alive tookabcprecedence over prolonging the photo op.

362
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,250
<24-4,House>有脑损伤不?
<24-4,House>Any brain damage?

363
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:53,270
<24-6,House>- 没 所有测试都显示--abc- 那显然有更多时间
<24-6,House>- No,all tests indicat-- -abcObviously you had more time.

364
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:57,050
<24-7,Chase>祝你好运
<24-7,Chase>Best of luck.

365
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,990
<24-8,House>我想我们不能再杀她一次abc获得更多图片
<24-8,House>I assume we can't killabcher again and take more pictures.

366
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,720
<24-9,Foreman>- 嗯 你要和Willson谈谈不?abc- 好主意
<24-9,Foreman>- Uh,you'll want to check with wilson?abc- Good one.

367
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:05,700
<24-11,Taub>一定有问题 是病变
<24-11,Taub>It's something,a lesion.

368
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,430
<24-12,Thirteen>肿瘤 伤痕组织
<24-12,Thirteen>Tumor,scar tissue.

369
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:09,190
<24-13,Foreman>可能是脓肿 感染
<24-13,Foreman>Could be an abscess,infection.

370
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,920
<24-13,Foreman>解释了为什么血液中不可见
<24-13,Foreman>Explains why it's invisible in the blood.

371
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:13,360
<24-13,Foreman>关起门来搞破坏
<24-13,Foreman>It's doing its damage behindabcclosed doors,sealed off.

372
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:19,510
<24-14,House>瞧 猜测的坏处就是 证据支离破碎不足信
<24-14,House>See,the problem with speculation is you makeabca spec out of "u" and some guy named "lation,"

373
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,040
<24-14,House>我完全不相信
<24-14,House>which really doesn't affect me at all.

374
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:24,170
<24-15,Taub>我们只能猜测 别无他法abc又不能做活检
<24-15,Taub>We have to guess. It's allabcwe've got. We can't do a biopsy.

375
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:27,780
<24-15,Taub>上次我们试图检查心脏时abc她差点没挺过去
<24-15,Taub>Last time we went into herabcheart,she had a major cardiac event.

376
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:31,570
<24-16,House>那只能...
<24-16,House>Which just leaves...

377
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,710
<25-1,Taub>你在找什么?
<25-1,Taub>What are you looking for?

378
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:40,450
<25-2,House>还不知道
<25-2,House>I don't know yet.

379
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,090
<25-3,Thirteen>画面不会改变
<25-3,Thirteen>The picture doesn't change.

380
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:44,250
<25-3,Thirteen>她躺那遭罪
<25-3,Thirteen>She lies there in pain.

381
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:47,080
<25-3,Thirteen>他坐那担心
<25-3,Thirteen>He sits there worried.

382
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,430
<25-4,House>什么都没变
<25-4,House>Nothing changes.

383
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,520
<25-4,House>我刚有个顿悟...
<25-4,House>I just had an epiphany...

384
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:59,260
<25-4,House>全靠自己
<25-4,House>all by myself.

385
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:00,950
<25-4,House>就这样出现在脑子里
<25-4,House>Popped into my head out of nothing.

386
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:02,220
<25-5,Taub>想分享下?
<25-5,Taub>Care to share?

387
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,630
<25-6,House>他太投入了
<25-6,House>He's too devoted.

388
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:07,020
<25-7,Foreman>太投入? 你认为他感到愧疚?
<25-7,Foreman>Too devoted? You think he feels guilty?

389
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:08,330
<25-8,House>对 我在挖苦
<25-8,House>Right,I'm being cynical.

390
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:12,530
<25-8,House>人们会单纯就是关心abc而非因为出轨后愧疚 理论上正确
<25-8,House>People can care because they care,notabcbecause they cheated,theoretically true.

391
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:16,080
<25-9,Thirteen>- 但淋病更说得通abc- 不对 没有性病 我们查过了
<25-9,Thirteen>- But gonorrhea fits better.abc- No. No stds. We tested her.

392
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:18,850
<25-11,Taub>- 你检查了血液abc- 就该这么检查
<25-11,Taub>- You tested her blood.abc- That is the test.

393
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:21,670
<25-12,House>那不是她的问题所在
<25-12,House>That's not where her problem is.

394
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:26,670
<25-12,House>淋病传播到心脏 细菌被包裹在脓肿里
<25-12,House>Gonorrhea disseminated to herabcheart,got walled off in an abscess.

395
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,740
<25-12,House>- 它不可见abc- 并且...
<25-12,House>- It'd be invisible.abc- And...

396
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:30,680
<25-13,Foreman>看上去像块阴影
<25-13,Foreman>would look like a shadow.

397
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,970
<25-14,House>没必要再次测试abc查查万人迷先生就可以了
<25-14,House>No need to test her again,butabcwe can check prince charming.

398
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,690
<25-14,House>一旦确证 切除心脏上脓肿
<25-14,House>Once you confirm,cut theabcabscess out of her heart.

399
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:43,610
<26-1,Molly>您的洋葱圈 特别处理过了
<26-1,Molly>Here are your onionabcrings,extra well-done.

<26-2,House>And another beer when you getabca chance. I'm celebrating.

402
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,190
<26-3,Molly>一个人?
<26-3,Molly>Alone?

403
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:51,820
<26-4,House>谢天谢地是一人
<26-4,House>Thank goodness.

404
00:25:57,910 --> 00:25:59,310
<26-4,House>不用说了 我是对的
<26-4,House>Don't tell me. I was right.

405
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,820
<26-5,Foreman>是 她男友得了淋病
<26-5,Foreman>Yep. Boyfriend has gonorrhea.

406
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:03,150
<26-6,House>对大家都有好处
<26-6,House>And everyone's a winner.

407
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,500
<26-7,Foreman>他可很不高兴
<26-7,Foreman>He's not too happy about it.

408
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:07,210
<26-7,Foreman>他坚称没有出轨abc一定是从她那传染的
<26-7,Foreman>He insists he's never cheated andabcmust've gotten it from her.

409
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:08,360
<26-8,House>难以苟同
<26-8,House>Don't think so.

410
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:09,500
<26-9,Foreman>时间上符合
<26-9,Foreman>Timing would fit.

411
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:11,370
<26-9,Foreman>他还没有症状 她却快要死了
<26-9,Foreman>He's got no symptoms,and she's dying.

412
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:12,910
<26-10,House>谎言也能解释一切
<26-10,House>Lying would fit too.

413
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:15,800
<26-11,Foreman>他不再去她病房陪着了
<26-11,Foreman>He's not hanging out in her room anymore.

414
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:19,100
<26-11,Foreman>有什么关系呢? 你是对的
<26-11,Foreman>What does it matter? You were right.

415
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:21,770
<26-11,Foreman>我们准备给她做手术
<26-11,Foreman>We're prepping her for surgery.

416
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,920
<26-12,House>我在他身上看到罪恶感
<26-12,House>I saw guilt in him.

417
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:34,410
<26-12,House>如果他不是真的感到内疚abc那么不是我对了 而是我侥幸
<26-12,House>If he's not actually guilty...abcthen I wasn't right. I was lucky.

418
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:38,440
<26-13,Foreman>House 你做了一个高明的推论
<26-13,Foreman>House,you made a brilliantabcdeduction about her heart.

419
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:41,370
<26-14,House>如果我只是侥幸...
<26-14,House>And if I was just lucky...

430
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:50,560
<27-1,Wilson>我和那儿一位医生是同学
<27-1,Wilson>I went to undergrad withabcone of the directors.

<28-2,Wilson>说是三件就可以 他们有洗衣服务
<28-2,Wilson>They said three. They have laundry.

<28-3,Amber>就像又和老妈一起住了 -- 爽啊
<28-3,Amber>Like living with momabcagain-- delightful.

435
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:18,520
<28-4,House>估计是Foreman
<28-4,House>It's probably foreman.

436
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:23,630
<28-5,Wilson>他没空
<28-5,Wilson>He's unavailable.

437
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,440
<28-6,Foreman>病人感染导致败血
<28-6,Foreman>Tell her the infection's made her septic.

438
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,460
<28-6,Foreman>血压上升前 我们无法切除脓肿
<28-6,Foreman>We can't remove theabcabscess until we get her B.P.Up.

439
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:29,150
<28-6,Foreman>输液毫无作用 没有--
<28-6,Foreman>And it's not responding toabcfluids. It's not--

00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,000
<28-11,House>为什么我没有恐惧?
<28-11,House>Why don't I feel scared?

444
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:53,740
<28-12,Wilson>我看你现在根本无法感知自己的感觉
<28-12,Wilson>I'd say you're unaware of whatabcyou're feeling at this moment.

445
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:55,930
<28-12,Wilson>我感觉到很糟

<28-18,Wilson>House... 这是你唯一的选择
<28-18,Wilson>House... it's your only option.

00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:22,580
<28-19,House>如果唯一选择没用 我怎么办?
<28-19,House>What do I do if myabconly option won't work?

462
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:50,210
<29-3,Foreman>可以关闭血管 以阻止她出血
<29-3,Foreman>It'll close the bloodabcvessels so she won't bleed out.

00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:53,140
<29-4,Taub>她的心脏无法承受多巴胺 会爆炸的
<29-4,Taub>Her heart can't take thatabcmuch dopamine. It'll explode.

<29-5,Foreman>如果不用多巴胺 心脏会内爆
<29-5,Foreman>And if we don't use theabcdopamine,it'll implode.

<34-10,Taub>It's a shame that she might die becauseabchouse has some personal crap to work through.

537
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:46,740
<34-11,Chase>确切说 病人会死 是因为abcHouse有乱七八糟的私事

538
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,880
<34-11,Chase>而我们又不够聪明独立 找出答案

552
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:00,720
<35-9,Amber>但是你不会这么做abc因为这样意味着在她面前承认失败
<35-9,Amber>But yocan't,because that wouldabcbe admitting defeat to her.

553
